HIRAM
'S
HOSPITAL
 
<EOS>
The
Rev.
Septimus
Harding
was
,
a
few
years
since
,
a
beneficed
clergyman
residing
in
the
cathedral
town
of
---
;
let
us
call
it
Barchester
.
<EOS>
Were
we
to
name
Wells
or
Salisbury
,
Exeter
,
Hereford
,
or
Gloucester
<EOS>
,
it
might
be
presumed
that
something
personal
was
intended
;
and
as
this
tale
will
refer
mainly
to
the
cathedral
dignitaries
of
the
town
in
question
,
we
are
anxious
that
no
personality
may
be
suspected
.
<EOS>
Let
us
presume
that
Barchester
is
a
quiet
town
in
the
West
of
England
,
more
remarkable
for
the
beauty
of
its
cathedral
and
the
antiquity
of
its
monuments
than
for
any
commercial
prosperity
;
that
the
west
end
of
Barchester
is
the
cathedral
close
,
and
that
the
aristocracy
of
Barchester
are
the
bishop
,
dean
,
and
canons
,
with
their
respective
wives
and
daughters
.
  
<EOS>
Early
in
life
Mr
Harding
found
himself
located
at
Barchester
.
<EOS>
A
fine
voice
and
a
taste
for
sacred
music
had
decided
the
position
in
which
he
was
to
exercise
his
calling
,
and
for
many
years
he
performed
the
easy
but
not
highly
paid
duties
of
a
minor
canon
.
<EOS>
At
the
age
of
forty
a
small
living
in
the
close
vicinity
of
the
town
increased
both
his
work
and
his
income
,
and
at
the
age
of
fifty
he
became
precentor
of
the
cathedral
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
had
married
early
in
life
,
and
was
the
father
of
two
daughters
.
<EOS>
The
eldest
,
Susan
,
was
born
soon
after
his
marriage
;
the
other
,
Eleanor
,
not
till
ten
years
later
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
time
at
which
we
introduce
him
to
our
readers
he
was
living
as
precentor
at
Barchester
with
his
youngest
daughter
,
then
twenty
-
four
years
of
age
;
having
been
many
years
a
widower
,
and
having
married
his
eldest
daughter
to
a
son
of
the
bishop
a
very
short
time
before
his
installation
to
the
office
of
precentor
.
  
<EOS>
Scandal
at
Barchester
affirmed
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
beauty
of
his
daughter
<EOS>
,
Mr
Harding
would
have
remained
a
minor
canon
;
but
here
probably
Scandal
lied
,
as
she
so
often
does
;
for
even
as
a
minor
canon
no
one
had
been
more
popular
among
his
reverend
brethren
in
the
close
than
Mr
Harding
;
and
Scandal
,
before
she
had
reprobated
Mr
Harding
for
being
made
precentor
by
his
friend
the
bishop
,
had
loudly
blamed
the
bishop
for
having
so
long
omitted
to
do
something
for
his
friend
Mr
Harding
.
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
Susan
Harding
,
some
twelve
years
since
,
had
married
the
Rev.
Dr
Theophilus
Grantly
,
son
of
the
bishop
,
archdeacon
of
Barchester
,
and
rector
of
Plumstead
Episcopi
,
and
her
father
became
,
a
few
months
later
,
precentor
of
Barchester
Cathedral
,
<EOS>
that
office
being
,
as
is
not
unusual
,
in
the
bishop
's
gift
.
  
<EOS>
Now
there
are
peculiar
circumstances
connected
with
the
precentorship
which
must
be
explained
.
<EOS>
In
the
year
1434
there
died
at
Barchester
one
John
Hiram
,
who
had
made
money
in
the
town
as
a
wool
-
stapler
,
and
in
his
will
he
left
the
house
in
which
he
died
and
certain
meadows
and
closes
near
the
town
,
still
called
Hiram
's
Butts
,
and
<EOS>
Hiram
's
Patch
,
for
the
support
of
twelve
superannuated
wool
-
carders
,
all
of
whom
should
have
been
born
and
bred
and
spent
their
days
in
Barchester
<EOS>
;
he
also
appointed
that
an
alms
-
house
should
be
built
for
their
abode
,
with
a
fitting
residence
for
a
warden
,
which
warden
was
also
to
receive
a
certain
sum
annually
out
of
the
rents
of
the
said
butts
and
patches
.
<EOS>
He
,
moreover
,
willed
,
having
had
a
soul
alive
to
harmony
,
that
the
precentor
of
the
cathedral
should
have
the
option
of
being
also
warden
of
the
almshouses
,
if
the
bishop
in
each
case
approved
.
  
<EOS>
From
that
day
to
this
the
charity
had
gone
on
and
prospered
 
at
least
,
the
charity
had
gone
on
,
and
the
estates
had
prospered
.
<EOS>
Wool
-
carding
in
Barchester
<EOS>
there
was
no
longer
any
;
so
the
bishop
,
dean
,
and
warden
,
who
took
it
in
turn
to
put
in
the
old
men
,
generally
appointed
some
hangers
-
on
of
their
own
;
worn
-
out
gardeners
,
decrepit
grave
-
diggers
,
or
octogenarian
sextons
,
who
thankfully
received
a
comfortable
lodging
and
one
shilling
and
fourpence
a
day
,
such
being
the
stipend
to
which
,
under
the
will
of
John
Hiram
,
they
were
declared
to
be
entitled
.
<EOS>
Formerly
,
indeed
,
 
that
is
,
till
within
some
fifty
years
of
the
present
time
,
 
they
received
but
sixpence
a
day
,
and
their
breakfast
and
dinner
was
found
them
at
a
common
table
by
the
warden
,
<EOS>
such
an
arrangement
being
in
stricter
conformity
with
the
absolute
wording
of
old
Hiram
's
will
:
but
this
was
thought
to
be
inconvenient
,
and
to
suit
the
tastes
of
neither
warden
nor
bedesmen
,
and
the
daily
one
shilling
and
fourpence
was
substituted
with
the
common
consent
of
all
parties
,
including
the
bishop
and
the
corporation
of
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
the
condition
of
Hiram
's
twelve
old
men
when
Mr
Harding
was
appointed
warden
;
but
if
they
may
be
considered
as
well
-
to
-
do
in
the
world
according
to
their
condition
,
the
happy
warden
was
much
more
so
.
<EOS>
The
patches
and
butts
which
,
in
John
Hiram
's
time
,
produced
hay
or
fed
cows
,
were
now
covered
with
rows
of
houses
;
the
value
of
the
property
had
gradually
increased
from
year
to
year
and
century
to
century
,
and
was
now
presumed
by
those
who
knew
anything
about
it
,
to
bring
in
a
very
nice
income
;
and
by
some
who
knew
nothing
about
it
,
to
have
increased
to
an
almost
fabulous
extent
.
  
<EOS>
The
property
was
farmed
by
a
gentleman
in
Barchester
,
who
also
acted
as
the
bishop
's
steward
,
 
a
man
whose
father
and
grandfather
had
been
stewards
to
the
bishops
of
Barchester
,
and
farmers
of
John
Hiram
's
estate
.
<EOS>
The
Chadwicks
had
earned
a
good
name
in
Barchester
;
they
had
lived
respected
by
bishops
,
deans
,
canons
,
and
precentors
;
they
had
been
buried
in
the
precincts
of
the
cathedral
;
they
had
never
been
known
as
griping
,
hard
men
,
but
had
always
lived
comfortably
,
maintained
a
good
house
,
and
held
a
high
position
in
Barchester
society
.
<EOS>
The
present
Mr
Chadwick
was
a
worthy
scion
of
a
worthy
stock
,
and
the
tenants
living
on
the
butts
and
patches
,
as
well
as
those
on
the
wide
episcopal
domains
of
the
see
,
were
well
pleased
to
have
to
do
with
so
worthy
and
liberal
a
steward
.
  
<EOS>
For
many
,
many
years
,
 
records
hardly
tell
how
many
,
probably
from
the
time
when
Hiram
's
wishes
had
been
first
fully
carried
out
,
 
the
proceeds
of
the
estate
had
been
paid
by
the
steward
or
farmer
to
the
warden
,
and
by
him
divided
among
the
bedesmen
;
after
which
division
he
paid
himself
such
sums
as
became
his
due
.
<EOS>
Times
had
been
when
the
poor
warden
got
nothing
but
his
bare
house
,
for
the
patches
had
been
subject
to
floods
,
and
the
land
of
Barchester
butts
was
said
to
be
unproductive
;
and
in
these
hard
times
the
warden
was
hardly
able
to
make
out
the
daily
dole
for
his
twelve
dependents
.
<EOS>
But
by
degrees
things
mended
;
the
patches
were
drained
,
and
cottages
began
to
rise
upon
the
butts
,
and
the
wardens
,
with
fairness
enough
,
repaid
themselves
for
the
evil
days
gone
by
.
<EOS>
In
bad
times
the
poor
men
had
had
their
due
,
and
therefore
in
good
times
they
could
expect
no
more
.
<EOS>
In
this
manner
the
income
of
the
warden
had
increased
;
the
picturesque
house
attached
to
the
hospital
had
been
enlarged
and
adorned
,
and
the
office
had
become
one
of
the
most
coveted
of
the
snug
clerical
sinecures
attached
to
our
church
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
wholly
in
the
bishop
's
gift
,
and
though
the
dean
and
chapter
,
in
former
days
,
made
a
stand
on
the
subject
,
they
had
thought
it
more
conducive
to
their
honour
to
have
a
rich
precentor
appointed
by
the
bishop
,
than
a
poor
one
appointed
by
themselves
.
<EOS>
The
stipend
of
the
precentor
of
Barchester
was
eighty
pounds
a
year
.
<EOS>
The
income
arising
from
the
wardenship
of
the
hospital
was
eight
hundred
,
besides
the
value
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Murmurs
,
very
slight
murmurs
,
had
been
heard
in
Barchester
,
 
few
indeed
,
and
far
between
,
 
that
the
proceeds
of
John
Hiram
's
property
had
not
been
fairly
divided
:
but
they
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
been
of
such
a
nature
as
to
have
caused
uneasiness
to
anyone
:
still
the
thing
had
been
whispered
,
and
Mr
Harding
had
heard
it
.
<EOS>
Such
was
his
character
in
Barchester
,
so
universal
was
his
popularity
,
that
the
very
fact
of
his
appointment
would
have
quieted
louder
whispers
than
those
which
had
been
heard
;
but
Mr
Harding
was
an
open
-
handed
,
just
-
minded
man
,
and
feeling
that
there
might
be
truth
in
what
had
been
said
,
he
had
,
on
his
instalment
,
declared
his
intention
of
adding
twopence
a
day
to
each
man
's
pittance
,
making
a
sum
of
sixty
-
two
pounds
eleven
shillings
and
fourpence
,
which
he
was
to
pay
out
of
his
own
pocket
.
<EOS>
In
doing
so
,
however
,
he
distinctly
and
repeatedly
observed
to
the
men
,
that
though
he
promised
for
himself
,
he
could
not
promise
for
his
successors
,
and
that
the
extra
twopence
could
only
be
looked
on
as
a
gift
from
himself
,
and
not
from
the
trust
.
<EOS>
The
bedesmen
,
however
,
were
most
of
them
older
than
Mr
Harding
,
and
were
quite
satisfied
with
the
security
on
which
their
extra
income
was
based
.
  
<EOS>
This
munificence
on
the
part
of
Mr
Harding
had
not
been
unopposed
.
<EOS>
Mr
Chadwick
had
mildly
but
seriously
dissuaded
him
from
it
;
and
his
strong
-
minded
son
-
in
-
law
,
the
archdeacon
,
the
man
of
whom
alone
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
stood
in
awe
,
had
urgently
,
nay
,
vehemently
,
opposed
so
impolitic
a
concession
:
but
the
warden
had
made
known
his
intention
to
the
hospital
before
the
archdeacon
had
been
able
to
interfere
,
and
the
deed
was
done
.
  
<EOS>
Hiram
's
Hospital
,
as
the
retreat
is
called
,
is
a
picturesque
building
enough
,
and
shows
the
correct
taste
with
which
the
ecclesiastical
architects
of
those
days
were
imbued
.
<EOS>
It
stands
on
the
banks
of
the
little
river
,
which
flows
nearly
round
the
cathedral
close
,
being
on
the
side
furthest
from
the
town
.
<EOS>
The
London
road
crosses
the
river
by
a
pretty
one
-
arched
bridge
,
and
,
looking
from
this
bridge
,
the
stranger
will
see
the
windows
of
the
old
men
's
rooms
,
each
pair
of
windows
separated
by
a
small
buttress
.
<EOS>
A
broad
gravel
walk
runs
between
the
building
and
the
river
,
which
is
always
trim
and
cared
for
;
and
at
the
end
of
the
walk
,
under
the
parapet
of
the
approach
to
the
bridge
,
is
a
large
and
well
-
worn
seat
,
on
which
,
in
mild
weather
,
three
or
four
of
Hiram
's
bedesmen
are
sure
to
be
seen
seated
.
<EOS>
Beyond
this
row
of
buttresses
,
and
further
from
the
bridge
,
and
also
further
from
the
water
which
here
suddenly
bends
,
are
the
pretty
oriel
windows
of
Mr
Harding
's
house
,
and
his
well
-
mown
lawn
.
<EOS>
The
entrance
to
the
hospital
is
from
the
London
road
,
and
is
made
through
a
ponderous
gateway
under
a
heavy
stone
arch
,
unnecessary
,
one
would
suppose
,
at
any
time
,
for
the
protection
of
twelve
old
men
,
but
greatly
conducive
to
the
good
appearance
of
Hiram
's
charity
.
<EOS>
On
passing
through
this
portal
,
never
closed
to
anyone
from
6
A.M.
<EOS>
till
10
P.M.
,
and
never
open
afterwards
,
except
on
application
to
a
huge
,
intricately
hung
mediæval
bell
,
the
handle
of
which
no
uninitiated
intruder
can
possibly
find
,
the
six
doors
of
the
old
men
's
abodes
are
seen
,
and
beyond
them
is
a
slight
iron
screen
,
through
which
the
more
happy
portion
of
the
Barchester
elite
pass
into
the
Elysium
of
Mr
Harding
's
dwelling
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
is
a
small
man
,
now
verging
on
sixty
years
,
but
bearing
few
of
the
signs
of
age
;
his
hair
is
rather
grizzled
,
though
not
gray
;
his
eye
is
very
mild
,
but
clear
and
bright
,
though
the
double
glasses
which
are
held
swinging
from
his
hand
,
unless
when
fixed
upon
his
nose
,
show
that
time
has
told
upon
his
sight
;
his
hands
are
delicately
white
,
and
both
hands
and
feet
are
small
;
he
always
wears
a
black
frock
coat
,
black
knee
-
breeches
,
and
black
gaiters
,
and
somewhat
scandalises
some
of
his
more
hyperclerical
brethren
by
a
black
neck
-
handkerchief
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
's
warmest
admirers
can
not
say
that
he
was
ever
an
industrious
man
;
the
circumstances
of
his
life
have
not
called
on
him
to
be
so
;
and
yet
he
can
hardly
be
called
an
idler
.
<EOS>
Since
his
appointment
to
his
precentorship
,
he
has
published
,
with
all
possible
additions
of
vellum
,
typography
,
and
gilding
,
a
collection
of
our
ancient
church
music
,
with
some
correct
dissertations
on
Purcell
,
Crotch
,
and
Nares
.
<EOS>
He
has
greatly
improved
the
choir
of
Barchester
,
which
,
under
his
dominion
,
now
rivals
that
of
any
cathedral
in
England
.
<EOS>
He
has
taken
something
more
than
his
fair
share
in
the
cathedral
services
,
and
has
played
the
violoncello
daily
to
such
audiences
as
he
could
collect
,
or
,
_
faute
de
mieux
_
,
to
no
audience
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
We
must
mention
one
other
peculiarity
of
Mr
Harding
.
<EOS>
As
we
have
before
stated
,
he
has
an
income
of
eight
hundred
a
year
,
and
has
no
family
but
his
one
daughter
;
and
yet
he
is
never
quite
at
ease
in
money
matters
.
<EOS>
The
vellum
and
gilding
of
"
Harding
's
Church
Music
"
cost
more
than
any
one
knows
,
except
the
author
,
the
publisher
,
and
the
Rev.
Theophilus
Grantly
,
who
allows
none
of
his

Then
he
is
generous
to
his
daughter
,
for
whose
service
he
keeps
a
small
carriage
and
pair
of
ponies
.
<EOS>
He
is
,
indeed
,
generous
to
all
,
but
especially
to
the
twelve
old
men
who
are
in
a
peculiar
manner
under
his
care
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
with
such
an
income
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
should
be
above
the
world
,
as
the
saying
is
;
but
,
at
any
rate
,
he
is
not
above
Archdeacon
Theophilus
Grantly
,
for
he
is
always
more
or
less
in
debt
to
his
son
-
in

who
has
,
to
a

assumed

<EOS>
THE
BARCHESTER
REFORMER
 
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
has
been
now
precentor
of
Barchester
for
ten
years
;
and
,
alas
,
the
murmurs
respecting
the
proceeds
of
Hiram
's
estate
are
again
becoming
audible
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
that
any
one
begrudges
to
Mr
Harding
the
income
which
he
enjoys
,
and
the
comfortable
place
which
so
well
becomes
him
;
but
such
matters
have
begun
to
be
talked
of
in
various
parts
of
England
.
<EOS>
Eager
pushing
politicians
have
asserted
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
with
very
telling
indignation
,
that
the
grasping
priests
of
the
Church
of
England
are
gorged
with
the
wealth
which
the
charity
of
former
times
has
left
for
the
solace
of
the
aged
,
or
the
education
of
the
young
.
<EOS>
The
well
-
known
case
of
the
Hospital
of
St
Cross
has
even
come
before
the
law
courts
of
the
country
,
and
the
struggles
of
Mr
Whiston
,
at
Rochester
,
have
met
with
sympathy
and
support
.
<EOS>
Men
are
beginning
to
say
that
these
things
must
be
looked
into
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
,
whose
conscience
in
the
matter
is
clear
,
and
who
has
never
felt
that
he
had
received
a
pound
from
Hiram
's
will
to
which
he
was
not
entitled
,
has
naturally
taken
the
part
of
the
church
in
talking
over
these
matters
with
his
friend
,
the
bishop
,
and
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
,
indeed
,
Dr
<EOS>
Grantly
,
has
been
somewhat
loud
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
personal
friend
of
the
dignitaries
of
the
Rochester
Chapter
,
and
has
written
letters
in
the
public
press
on
the
subject
of
that
turbulent
<EOS>
Dr
Whiston
,
which
,
his
admirers
think
,
must
well
nigh
set
the
question
at
rest
.
<EOS>
It
is
also
known
at
Oxford
that
he
is
the
author
of
the
pamphlet
signed
"
Sacerdos
"
on
the
subject
of
the
Earl
of
Guildford
and
St
Cross
,
in
which
it
is
so
clearly
argued
that
the
manners
of
the
present
times
do
not
admit
of
a
literal
adhesion
to
the
very
words
of
the
founder
's
will
,
but
that
the
interests
of
the
church
for
which
the
founder
was
so
deeply
concerned
are
best
consulted
in
enabling
its
bishops
to
reward
those
shining
lights
whose
services
have
been
most
signally
serviceable
to
Christianity
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
this
,
it
is
asserted
that
Henry
de
Blois
,
founder
of
St
Cross
,
was
not
greatly
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
reformed
church
,
and
that
the
masters
of
St
Cross
,
for
many
years
past
,
can
not
be
called
shining
lights
in
the
service
of
Christianity
;
it
is
,
however
,
stoutly
maintained
,
and
no
doubt
felt
,
by
all
the
archdeacon
's
friends
,
that
his
logic
is
conclusive
,
and
has
not
,
in
fact
,
been
answered
.
  
<EOS>
With
such
a
tower
of
strength
to
back
both
his
arguments
and
his
conscience
,
it
may
be
imagined
that
Mr
Harding
has
never
felt
any
compunction
as
to
receiving
his
quarterly
sum
of
two
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
subject
has
never
presented
itself
to
his
mind
in
that
shape
.
<EOS>
He
has
talked
not
unfrequently
,
and
heard
very
much
about
the
wills
of
old
founders
and
the
incomes
arising
from
their
estates
,
during
the
last
year
or
two
;
he
did
even
,
at
one
moment
,
feel
a
doubt
(
since
expelled
by
his
son
-
in
-
law
's
logic
)
as
to
whether
Lord
Guildford
was
clearly
entitled
to
receive
so
enormous
an
income
as
he
does
from
the
revenues
of
St
Cross
;
but
that
he
himself
was
overpaid
with
his
modest
eight
hundred
pounds
,
 
he
who
,
out
of
that
,
voluntarily
gave
up
sixty
-
two
pounds
eleven
shillings
and
fourpence
a
year
to
his
twelve
old
neighbours
,
 
he
who
,
for
the
money
,
does
his
precentor
's
work
as
no
precentor
has
done
it
before
,
since
Barchester
Cathedral
was
built
,
 
such
an
idea
has
never
sullied
his
quiet
,
or
disturbed
his
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
Mr
Harding
is
becoming
uneasy
at
the
rumour
which
he
knows
to
prevail
in
Barchester
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
He
is
aware
that
,
at
any
rate
,
two
of
his
old
men
have
been
heard
to
say
,
that
if
everyone
had
his
own
,
they
might
each
have
their
hundred
pounds
a
year
,
and
live
like
gentlemen
,
instead
of
a
beggarly
one
shilling
and
sixpence
a
day
;
and
that
they
had
slender
cause
to
be
thankful
for
a
miserable
dole
of
twopence
,
when
Mr
Harding
and
Mr
Chadwick
,
between
them
,
ran
away
with
thousands
of
pounds
which
good
old
John
Hiram
never
intended
for
the
like
of
them
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
ingratitude
of
this
which
stings
Mr
Harding
.
<EOS>
One
of
this
discontented
pair
,
Abel
Handy
,
was
put
into
the
hospital
by
himself
;
he
had
been
a
stone
-
mason
in
Barchester
,
and
had
broken
his
thigh
by
a
fall
from
a
scaffolding
,
while
employed
about
the
cathedral
;
and
Mr
Harding
had
given
him
the
first
vacancy
in
the
hospital
after
the
occurrence
,
although
Dr
Grantly
had
been
very
anxious
to
put
into
it
an
insufferable
clerk
of
his
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
,
who
had
lost
all
his
teeth
,
and
whom
the
archdeacon
hardly
knew
how
to
get
rid
of
by
other
means
.
<EOS>
Dr
Grantly
has
not
forgotten
to
remind
Mr
Harding
<EOS>
how
well
satisfied
with
his
one
-
and
-
sixpence
a
day
old
Joe
Mutters
would
have
been
,
and
how
injudicious
it
was
on
the
part
of
Mr
Harding
to
allow
a
radical
from
the
town
to
get
into
the
concern
.
<EOS>
Probably
Dr
Grantly
forgot
,
at
the
moment
,
that
the
charity
was
intended
for
broken
-
down
journeymen
of
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
living
at
Barchester
,
a
young
man
,
a
surgeon
,
named
John
Bold
,
and
both
Mr
Harding
and
Dr
<EOS>
Grantly
are
well
aware
that
to
him
is
<EOS>
owing
the
pestilent
rebellious
feeling
which
has
shown
itself
in
the
hospital
;
yes
,
and
the
renewal
,
too
,
of
that
disagreeable
talk
about
Hiram
's
estates
which
is
now
again
prevalent
in
Barchester
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
Mr
Harding
and
Mr
Bold
are
acquainted
with
each
other
;
we
may
say
,
are
friends
,
considering
the
great
disparity
in
their
years
.
<EOS>
Dr
<EOS>
Grantly
,
however
,
has
a
holy
horror
of
the
impious
demagogue
,
as
on
one
occasion
he
called
Bold
,
when
speaking
of
him
to
the
precentor
;
and
being
a
more
prudent
far
-
seeing
man
than
Mr
Harding
,
and
possessed
of
a
stronger
head
,
he
already
perceives
that
this
John
Bold
will
work
great
trouble
in
Barchester
.
<EOS>
He
considers
that
he
is
to
be
regarded
as
an
enemy
,
and
thinks
that
he
should
not
be
admitted
into
the
camp
on
anything
like
friendly
terms
.
<EOS>
As
John
Bold
will
occupy
much
of
our
attention
,
we
must
endeavour
to
explain
who
he
is
,
and
why
he
takes
the
part
of
John
Hiram
's
bedesmen
.
  
<EOS>
John
Bold
is
a
young
surgeon
,
who
passed
many
of
his
boyish
years
at
Barchester
.
<EOS>
His
father
was
a
physician
in
the
city
of
London
,
where
he
made
a
moderate
fortune
,
which
he
invested
in
houses
in
that
city
.
<EOS>
The
Dragon
of
Wantly
inn
and
posting
-
house
belonged
to
him
,
also
four
shops
in
the
High
Street
,
and
a
moiety
of
the
new
row
of
genteel
villas
(
so
called
in
the
advertisements
)
,
built
outside
the
town
just
beyond
Hiram
's
Hospital
.
<EOS>
To
one
of
these
Dr
Bold
retired
to
spend
the
evening
of
his
life
,
and
to
die
;
and
here
his
son
John
spent
his
holidays
,
and
afterwards
his
Christmas
vacation
when
he
went
from
school
to
study
surgery
in
the
London
hospitals
.
<EOS>
Just
as
John
Bold
was
entitled
to
write
himself
surgeon
and
apothecary
,
old
Dr
Bold
died
,
leaving
his
Barchester
property
to
his
son
,
and
a
certain
sum
in
the
three
per
cents
.
<EOS>
to
his
daughter
Mary
,
who
is
some
four
or
five
years
older
than
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
John
Bold
determined
to
settle
himself
at
Barchester
,
and
look
after
his
own
property
,
as
well
as
the
bones
and
bodies
of
such
of
his
neighbours
as
would
call
upon
him
for
assistance
in
their
troubles
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
put
up
a
large
brass
plate
with
"
John
Bold
,
Surgeon
"
on
it
,
to
the
great
disgust
of
the
nine
practitioners
who
were
already
trying
to
get
a
living
out
of
the
bishop
,
dean
,
and
canons
;
and
began
house
-
keeping
with
the
aid
of
his
sister
.
<EOS>
At
this
time
he
was
not
more
than
twenty
-
four
years
old
;
and
though
he
has
now
been
three
years
in
Barchester
,
we
have
not
heard
that
he
has
done
much
harm
to
the
nine
worthy
practitioners
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
their
dread
of
him
has
died
away
;
for
in
three
years
he
has
not
taken
three
fees
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
John
Bold
is
a
clever
man
,
and
would
,
with
practice
,
be
a
clever
surgeon
;
but
he
has
got
quite
into
another
line
of
life
.
<EOS>
Having
enough
to
live
on
,
he
has
not
been
forced
to
work
for
bread
;
he
has
declined
to
subject
himself
to
what
he
calls
the
drudgery
of
the
profession
,
by
which
,
I
believe
,
he
means
the
general
work
of
a
practising
surgeon
;
and
has
found
other
employment
.
<EOS>
He
frequently
binds
up
the
bruises
and
sets
the
limbs
of
such
of
the
poorer
classes
as
profess
his
way
of
thinking
,
 
but
this
he
does
for
love
.
<EOS>
Now
I
will
not
say
that
the
archdeacon
is
strictly
correct
in
stigmatising
John
Bold
as
a
demagogue
,
for
I
hardly
know
how
extreme
must
be
a
man
's
opinions
before
he
can
be
justly
so
called
;
but
Bold
is
a
strong
reformer
.
<EOS>
His
passion
is
the
reform
of
all
abuses
;
state
abuses
,
church
abuses
,
corporation
abuses
(
he
has
got
himself
elected
a
town
councillor
of
Barchester
,
and
has
so
worried
three
consecutive
mayors
,
that
it
became
somewhat
difficult
to
find
a
fourth
)
,
abuses
in
medical
practice
,
and
general
abuses
in
the
world
at
large
.
<EOS>
Bold
is
thoroughly
sincere
in
his
patriotic
endeavours
to
mend
mankind
,
and
there
is
something
to
be
admired
in
the
energy
with
which
he
devotes
himself
to
remedying
evil
and
stopping
injustice
;
but
I
fear
that
he
is
too
much
imbued
with
the
idea
that
he
has
a
special
mission
for
reforming
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
well
if
one
so
young
had
a
little
more
diffidence
himself
,
and
more
trust
in
the
honest
purposes
of
others
,
 
if
he
could
be
brought
to
believe
that
old
customs
need
not
necessarily
be
evil
,
and
that
changes
may
possibly
be
dangerous
;
but
no
,
Bold
has
all
the
ardour
and
all
the
self
-
assurance
of
a
Danton
,
and
hurls
his
anathemas
against
time
-
honoured
practices
with
the
violence
of
a
French
Jacobin
.
  
<EOS>
No
wonder
that
Dr
Grantly
should
regard
Bold
as
a
firebrand
,
falling
,
as
he
has
done
,
almost
in
the
centre
of
the
quiet
ancient
close
of
Barchester
Cathedral
.
<EOS>
Dr
Grantly
would
have
him
avoided
as
the
plague
;
but
the
old
Doctor
and
Mr
Harding
were
fast
friends
.
<EOS>
Young
Johnny
Bold
used
to
play
as
a
boy
on
Mr
Harding
's
lawn
;
he
has
many
a
time
won
the
precentor
's
heart
by
listening
with
rapt
attention
to
his
sacred
strains
;
and
since
those
days
,
to
tell
the
truth
at
once
,
he
has
nearly
won
another
heart
within
the
same
walls
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
Harding
has
not
plighted
her
troth
to
John
Bold
,
nor
has
she
,
perhaps
,
owned
to
herself
how
dear
to
her
<EOS>
the
young
reformer
is
;
but
she
can
not
endure
that
anyone
should
speak
harshly
of
him
.
<EOS>
She
does
not
dare
to
defend
him
when
her
brother
-
in
-
law
is
so
loud
against
him
;
for
she
,
like
her
father
,
is
somewhat
afraid
of
Dr
Grantly
;
but
she
is
beginning
greatly
to
dislike
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
She
persuades
her
father
that
it
would
be
both
unjust
and
injudicious
to
banish
his
young
friend
because
of
his
politics
;
she
cares
little
to
go
to
houses
where
she
will
not
meet
him
,
and
,
in
fact
,
she
is
in
love
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
is
there
any
good
reason
why
Eleanor
Harding
should
not
love
John
Bold
.
<EOS>
He
has
all
those
qualities
which
are
likely
to
touch
a
girl
's
heart
.
<EOS>
He
is
brave
,
eager
,
and
amusing
;
well
-
made
and
good
-
looking
;
young
and
enterprising
;
his
character
is
in
all
respects
good
;
he
has
sufficient
income
to
support
a
wife
;
he
is
her
father
's
friend
;
and
,
above
all
,
he
is
in
love
with
her
:
<EOS>
then
why
should
not
Eleanor
Harding
be
attached
to
John
Bold
?
  
<EOS>
Dr
Grantly
,
who
has
as
many
eyes
as
Argus
,
and
has
long
seen
how
the
wind
blows
in
that
direction
,
thinks
there
are
various
strong
reasons
why
this
should
not
be
so
.
<EOS>
He
has
not
thought
it
wise
as
yet
to
speak
to
his
father
-
in
-
law
on
the
subject
,
for
he
knows
how
foolishly
indulgent
is
Mr
Harding
in
everything
that
concerns
his
daughter
;
but
he
has
discussed
the
matter
with
his
all
-
trusted
helpmate
,
within
that
sacred
recess
formed
by
the
clerical
bed
-
curtains
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
.
  
<EOS>
How
much
sweet
solace
,
how
much
valued
counsel
has
our
archdeacon
received
within
that
sainted
enclosure
!
'
<EOS>
tis
there
alone
that
he
unbends
,
and
comes
down
from
his
high
church
pedestal
to
the
level
of
a
mortal
man
.
<EOS>
In
the
world
Dr
Grantly
never
lays
aside
that
demeanour
which
so
well
becomes
him
.
<EOS>
He
has
all
the
dignity
of
an
ancient
saint
with
the
sleekness
of
a
modern
bishop
;
he
is
always
the
same
;
he
is
always
the
archdeacon
;
unlike
Homer
,
he
never
nods
.
<EOS>
Even
with
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
even
with
the
bishop
and
dean
,
he
maintains
that
sonorous
tone
and
lofty
deportment
which
strikes
awe
into
the
young
hearts
of
Barchester
,
and
absolutely
cows
the
whole
parish
of
Plumstead
Episcopi
.
'
<EOS>
tis
only
when
he
has
exchanged
that
ever
-
new
shovel
hat
for
a
tasselled
nightcap
,
and
those
shining
black
habiliments
for
his
accustomed
_
robe
de
nuit
_
,
that
Dr
Grantly
talks
,
and
looks
,
and
thinks
like
an
ordinary
man
.
  
<EOS>
Many
of
us
have
often
thought
how
severe
a
trial
of
faith
must
this
be
to
the
wives
of
our
great
church
dignitaries
.
<EOS>
To
us
these
men
are
personifications
of
St
Paul
;
their
very
gait
is
a
speaking
sermon
;
their
clean
and
sombre
apparel
exacts
from
us
faith
and
submission
,
and
the
cardinal
virtues
seem
to
hover
round
their
sacred
hats
.
<EOS>
A
dean
or
archbishop
,
in
the
garb
of
his
order
,
is
sure
of
our
reverence
,
and
a
well
-
got
-
up
bishop
fills
our
very
souls
with
awe
.
<EOS>
But
how
can
this
feeling
be
perpetuated
in
the
bosoms
of
those
who
see
the
bishops
without
their
aprons
,
and
the
archdeacons
even
in
a
lower
state
of
dishabille
?
  
<EOS>
Do
we
not
all
know
some
reverend
,
all
but
sacred
,
personage
before
whom
our
tongue
ceases
to
be
loud
and
our
step
to
be
elastic
?
<EOS>
But
were
we
once
to
see
him
stretch
himself
beneath
the
bed
-
clothes
,
yawn
widely
,
and
bury
his
face
upon
his
pillow
,
we
could
chatter
before
him
as
glibly
as
before
a
doctor
or
a
lawyer
.
<EOS>
From
some
such
cause
,
doubtless
,
it
arose
that
our
archdeacon
listened
to
the
counsels
of
his
wife
,
though
he
considered
himself
entitled
to
give
counsel
to
every
other
being
whom
he
met
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
adjusted
the
copious
folds
of
his
nightcap
,
"
there
was
that
John
Bold
at
your
father
's
again
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
must
say
your
father
is
very
imprudent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
imprudent
;
 
he
always
was
,
"
replied
Mrs
Grantly
,
speaking
from
under
the
comfortable
bed
-
clothes
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
new
in
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
,
there
's
nothing
new
;
 
I
know
that
;
but
,
at
the
present
juncture
of
affairs
,
such
imprudence
is
 
<EOS>
is
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
if
he
does
not
take
care
what
he
's
about
,
John
Bold
will
be
off
with
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
will
,
whether
papa
takes
care
or
no
;
and
why
not
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
almost
screamed
the
archdeacon
,
giving
so
rough
a
pull
at
his
nightcap
as
almost
to
bring
it
over
his
nose
;
"
why
not
!
 
<EOS>
that
pestilent
,
interfering
upstart
,
John
Bold
;
 
the
most
vulgar
young
person
I
ever
met
!
<EOS>
Do
you
know
that
he
is
meddling
with
your
father
's
affairs
in
a
most
uncalled
-
for
 
most
 
"
And
being
at
a
loss
for
an
epithet
sufficiently
injurious
,
he
finished
his
expressions
of
horror
by
muttering
,
"
Good
heavens
!
"
<EOS>
in
a
manner
that
had
been
found
very
efficacious
in
clerical
meetings
of
the
diocese
.
<EOS>
He
must
for
the
moment
have
forgotten
where
he
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
his
vulgarity
,
archdeacon
"
<EOS>
(
Mrs
Grantly
had
never
assumed
a
more
familiar
term
than
this
in
addressing
her
husband
)
,
"
I
do
n't
agree
with
you
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
like
Mr
Bold
;
 
<EOS>
he
is
a
great
deal
too
conceited
for
me
;
but
then
Eleanor
does
,
and
it
would
be
the
best
thing
in
the
world
for
papa
if
they
were
to
marry
.
<EOS>
Bold
would
never
trouble
himself
about
Hiram
's
Hospital
if
he
were
papa
's
son
-
in
-
law
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
lady
turned
herself
round
under
the
bed
-
clothes
,
in
a
manner
to
which
the
doctor
was
well
accustomed
,
and
which
told
him
,
as
plainly
as
words
,
that
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
the
subject
was
over
for
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
heavens
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
the
doctor
again
;
 
he
was
evidently
much
put
beside
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Grantly
is
by
no
means
a
bad
man
;
he
is
exactly
the
man
<EOS>
which
such
an
education
as
his
was
most
likely
to
form
;
his
intellect
being
sufficient
for
such
a
place
in
the
world
,
but
not
sufficient
to
put
him
in
advance
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
performs
with
a
rigid
constancy
such
of
the
duties
of
a
parish
clergyman
as
are
,
to
his
thinking
,
above
the
sphere
of
his
curate
,
but
it
is
as
an
archdeacon
that
he
shines
.
  
<EOS>
We
believe
,
as
a
general
rule
,
that
either
a
bishop
or
his
archdeacons
have
sinecures
:
where
a
bishop
works
,
archdeacons
have
but
little
to
do
,
and
_
vice
versa
_
.
<EOS>
In
the
diocese
of
Barchester
the
Archdeacon
of
Barchester
does
the
work
.
<EOS>
In
that
capacity
he
is
diligent
,
authoritative
,
and
,
as
his
friends
particularly
boast
,
judicious
.
<EOS>
His
great
fault
is
an
overbearing
assurance
of
the
virtues
and
claims
of
his
order
,
and
his
great
foible
is
an
equally
strong
confidence
in
the
dignity
of
his
own
manner
and
the
eloquence
of
his
own
words
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
moral
man
,
believing
the
precepts
which
he
teaches
,
and
believing
also
that
he
acts
up
to
them
;
though
we
can
not
say
that
he
would
give
his
coat
to
the
man
who
took
his
cloak
,
or
that
he
is
prepared
to
forgive
his
brother
even
seven
times
.
<EOS>
He
is
severe
enough
in
exacting
his
dues
,
considering
that
any
laxity
in
this
respect
would
endanger
the
security
of
the
church
;
and
,
could
he
have
his
way
,
he
would
consign
to
darkness
and
perdition
,
not
only
every
individual
reformer
,
but
every
committee
and
every
commission
that
would
even
dare
to
ask
a
question
respecting
the
appropriation
of
church
revenues
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
church
revenues
:
the
laity
admit
it
.
<EOS>
Surely
the
church
is
able
to
administer
her
own
revenues
.
"
<EOS>
'
twas
thus
he
was
accustomed
to
argue
,
when
the
sacrilegious
doings
of
Lord
John
Russell
and
others
were
discussed
either
at
Barchester
or
at
Oxford
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
no
wonder
that
Dr
Grantly
did
not
like
John
Bold
,
and
that
his
wife
's
suggestion
that
he
should
become
closely
connected
with
such
a
man
dismayed
him
.
<EOS>
To
give
him
his
due
,
the
archdeacon
never
wanted
courage
;
he
was
quite
willing
to
meet
his
enemy
on
any
field
and
with
any
weapon
.
<EOS>
He
had
that
belief
in
his
own
arguments
that
he
felt
sure
of
success
,
could
he
only
be
sure
of
a
fair
fight
on
the
part
of
his
adversary
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
idea
that
John
Bold
could
really
prove
that
the
income
of
the
hospital
was
malappropriated
;
why
,
then
,
should
peace
be
sought
for
on
such
base
terms
?
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
bribe
an
unbelieving
enemy
of
the
church
with
the
sister
-
in
-
law
of
one
dignitary
and
the
daughter
of
another
 
with
a
young
lady
whose
connections
with
the
diocese
and
chapter
of
Barchester
were
so
close
as
to
give
her
an
undeniable
claim
to
a
husband
endowed
with
some
of
its
sacred
wealth
!
<EOS>
When
Dr
Grantly
talks
of
unbelieving
enemies
,
he
does
not
mean
to
imply
want
of
belief
in
the
doctrines
of
the
church
,
but
an
equally
dangerous
scepticism
as
to
its
purity
in
money
matters
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Grantly
is
not
usually
deaf
to
the
claims
of
the
high
order
to
which
she
belongs
.
<EOS>
She
and
her
husband
rarely
disagree
as
to
the
tone
with
which
the
church
should
be
defended
;
how
singular
,
then
,
that
in
such
a
case
as
this
she
should
be
willing
to
succumb
!
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
again
murmurs
"
Good
heavens
!
"
<EOS>
as
he
lays
himself
beside
her
,
but
he
does
so
in
a
voice
audible
only
to
himself
,
and
he
repeats
it
till
sleep
relieves
him
from
deep
thought
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
himself
has
seen
no
reason
why
his
daughter
should
not
love
John
Bold
.
<EOS>
He
has
not
been
unobservant
of
her
feelings
,
and
perhaps
his
deepest
regret
at
the
part
which
he
fears
Bold
is
about
to
take
regarding
the
hospital
arises
from
the
dread
that
he
may
be
separated
from
his
daughter
,
or
that
she
may
be
separated
from
the
man
she
loves
.
<EOS>
He
has
never
spoken
to
Eleanor
about
her
lover
;
he
is
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
allude
to
such
a
subject
unconsulted
,
even
with
his
own
daughter
;
and
had
he
considered
that
he
had
ground
to
disapprove
of
Bold
,
he
would
have
removed
her
,
or
forbidden
him
his
house
;
but
he
saw
no
such
ground
.
<EOS>
He
would
probably
have
preferred
a
second
clerical
son
-
in
-
law
,
for
Mr
Harding
,
also
,
is
attached
to
his
order
;
and
,
failing
in
that
,
he
would
at
any
rate
have
wished
that
so
near
a
connection
should
have
thought
alike
with
him
on
church
matters
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
,
however
,
reject
the
man
his
daughter
loved
because
he
differed
on
such
subjects
with
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
Bold
had
taken
no
steps
in
the
matter
in
any
way
annoying
to
Mr
Harding
personally
.
<EOS>
Some
months
since
,
after
a
severe
battle
,
which
cost
him
not
a
little
money
,
he
gained
a
victory
over
a
certain
old
turnpike
woman
in
the
neighbourhood
,
of
whose
charges
another
old
woman
had
complained
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
got
the
Act
of
Parliament
relating
to
the
trust
,
found
that
his
_
protégée
_
had
been
wrongly
taxed
,
rode
through
the
gate
himself
,
paying
the
toll
,
then
brought
an
action
against
the
gate
-
keeper
,
and
proved
that
all
people
coming
up
a
certain
by
-
lane
,
and
going
down
a
certain
other
by
-
lane
,
were
toll
-
free
.
<EOS>
The
fame
of
his
success
spread
widely
abroad
,
and
he
began
to
be
looked
on
as
the
upholder
of
the
rights
of
the
poor
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
Not
long
after
this
success
,
he
heard
from
different
quarters
that
Hiram
's
bedesmen
were
treated
as
paupers
,
whereas
the
property
to
which
they
were
,
in
effect
,
heirs
was
very
large
;
and
he
was
instigated
by
the
lawyer
whom
he
had
employed
in
the
case
of
the
turnpike
to
call
upon
Mr
Chadwick
for
a
statement
as
to
the
funds
of
the
estate
.
  
<EOS>
Bold
had
often
expressed
his
indignation
at
the
malappropriation
of
church
funds
in
general
,
in
the
hearing
of
his
friend
the
precentor
;
but
the
conversation
had
never
referred
to
anything
at
Barchester
;
and
when
Finney
,
the
attorney
,
induced
him
to
interfere
with
the
affairs
of
the
hospital
,
it
was
against
Mr
Chadwick
that
his
efforts
were
to
be
directed
.
<EOS>
Bold
soon
found
that
if
he
interfered
with
Mr
Chadwick
as
steward
,
he
must
also
interfere
with
Mr
Harding
as
warden
;
and
though
he
regretted
the
situation
in
which
this
would
place
him
,
he
was
not
the
man
to
flinch
from
his
undertaking
from
personal
motives
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
had
determined
to
take
the
matter
in
hand
,
he
set
about
his
work
with
his
usual
energy
.
<EOS>
He
got
a
copy
of
John
Hiram
's
will
,
of
the
wording
of
which
he
made
himself
perfectly
master
.
<EOS>
He
ascertained
the
extent
of
the
property
,
and
as
nearly
as
he
could
the
value
of
it
;
and
made
out
a
schedule
of
what
he
was
informed
was
the
present
distribution
of
its
income
.
<EOS>
Armed
with
these
particulars
,
he
called
on
Mr
Chadwick
,
having
given
that
gentleman
notice
of
his
visit
;
and
asked
him
for
a
statement
of
the
income
and
expenditure
of
the
hospital
for
the
last
twenty
-
five
years
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
of
course
refused
,
Mr
Chadwick
alleging
that
he
had
no
authority
for
making
public
the
concerns
of
a
property
in
managing
which
he
was
only
a
paid
servant
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
is
competent
to
give
you
that
authority
,
Mr
Chadwick
?
"
asked
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
those
who
employ
me
,
Mr
Bold
,
"
said
the
steward
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
are
those
,
Mr
Chadwick
?
"
demanded
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Chadwick
begged
to
say
that
if
these
inquiries
were
made
merely
out
of
curiosity
,
he
must
decline
answering
them
:
if
Mr
Bold
had
any
ulterior
proceeding
in
view
,
perhaps
it
would
be
desirable
that
any
necessary
information
should
be
sought
for
in
a
professional
way
by
a
professional
man
.
<EOS>
Mr
Chadwick
's
attorneys
were
Messrs
Cox
and
Cummins
,
of
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bold
took
down
the
address
of
Cox
and
Cummins
,
remarked
that
the
weather
was
cold
for
the
time
of
the
year
,
and
wished
Mr
Chadwick
good
-
morning
.
<EOS>
Mr
Chadwick
said
it
was
cold
for
June
,
and
bowed
him
out
.
  
<EOS>
He
at
once
went
to
his
lawyer
,
Finney
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Bold
was
not
very
fond
of
his
attorney
,
but
,
as
he
said
,
he
merely
wanted
a
man
who
knew
the
forms
of
law
,
and
who
would
do
what
he
was
told
for
his
money
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
idea
of
putting
himself
in
the
hands
of
a
lawyer
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
law
from
a
lawyer
as
he
did
a
coat
from
a
tailor
,
because
he
could
not
make
it
so
well
himself
;
and
he
thought
Finney
the
fittest
man
in
Barchester
for
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
In
one
respect
,
at
any
rate
,
he
was
right
:
Finney
was
humility
itself
.
  
<EOS>
Finney
advised
an
instant
letter
to
Cox
and
Cummins
,
mindful
of
his
six
-
and
-
eightpence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Slap
at
them
at
once
,
Mr
Bold

<EOS>
Demand
categorically
and
explicitly
<EOS>
a
full
statement
of
the
affairs
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
I
were
to
see
Mr
Harding
first
,
"
suggested
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
by
all
means
,
"
said
the
acquiescing
Finney
;
"
though
,
perhaps
,
as
Mr
Harding
is
no
man
of
business
,
it
may
lead
 
lead
to
some
little
difficulties
;
but
perhaps
you
're
right
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bold
,
I
do
n't
think
seeing
Mr
Harding
can
do
any
harm
.
"
<EOS>
Finney
saw
from
the
expression
of
his
client
's
face
that
he
intended
to
have
his
own
way
.
   
<EOS>
THE
BISHOP
OF
BARCHESTER
 
<EOS>
Bold
at
once
repaired
to
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
The
day
was
now
far
advanced
,
but
he
knew
that
Mr
Harding
dined
in
the
summer
at
four
,
that
Eleanor
was
accustomed
to
drive
in
the
evening
,
and
that
he
might
therefore
probably
find
Mr
Harding
alone
.
<EOS>
It
was
between
seven
and
eight
when
he
reached
the
slight
iron
gate
leading
into
the
precentor
's
garden
,
and
though
,
as
Mr
Chadwick
observed
,
the
day
had
been
cold
for
June
,
the
evening
was
mild
,
and
soft
,
and
sweet
.
<EOS>
The
little
gate
was
open
.
<EOS>
As
he
raised
the
latch
he
heard
the
notes
of
Mr
Harding
's
violoncello
from
the
far
end
of
the
garden
,
and
,
advancing
before
the
house
and
across
the
lawn
,
he
found
him
playing
;
 
and
not
without
an
audience
.
<EOS>
The
musician
was
seated
in
a
garden
-
chair
just
within
the
summer
-
house
,
so
as
to
allow
the
violoncello
which
he
held
between
his
knees
to
rest
upon
the
dry
stone
flooring
;
before
him
stood
a
rough
music
desk
,
on
which
was
open
a
page
of
that
dear
sacred
book
,
that
much
-
laboured
and
much
-
loved
volume
of
church
music
,
which
had
cost
so
many
guineas
;
and
around
sat
,
and
lay
,
and
stood
,
and
leaned
,
ten
of
the
twelve
old
men
who
dwelt
with
him
beneath
old
John
Hiram
's
roof
.
<EOS>
The
two
reformers
were
not
there
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
in
their
hearts
they
were
conscious
of
any
wrong
done
or
to
be
done
to
their
mild
warden
,
but
latterly
they
had
kept
aloof
from
him
,
and
his
music
was
no
longer
to
their
taste
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
amusing
to
see
the
positions
,
and
eager
listening
faces
of
these
well
-
to
-
do
old
men
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
they
all
appreciated
the
music
which
they
heard
,
but
they
were
intent
on
appearing
to
do
so
;
pleased
at
being
where
they
were
,
they
were
determined
,
as
far
as
in
them
lay
,
to
give
pleasure
in
return
;
and
they
were
not
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
It
gladdened
the
precentor
's
heart
to
think
that
the
old
bedesmen
whom
he
loved
so
well
admired
the
strains
which
were
to
him
so
full
of
almost
ecstatic
joy
;
and
he
used
to
boast
that
such
was
the
air
of
the
hospital
,
as
to
make
it
a
precinct
specially
fit
for
the
worship
of
St
Cecilia
.
  
<EOS>
Immediately
before
him
,
on
the
extreme
corner
of
the
bench
which
ran
round
the
summer
-
house
,
sat
one
old
man
,
with
his
handkerchief
smoothly
lain
upon
his
knees
,
who
did
enjoy
the
moment
,
or
acted
enjoyment
well
.
<EOS>
He
was
one
on
whose
large
frame
many
years
,
for
he
was
over
eighty
,
had
made
small
havoc
;
 
he
was
still
an
upright
,
burly
,
handsome
figure
,
with
an
open
,
ponderous
brow
,
round
which
clung
a
few
,
though
very
few
,
thin
gray
locks
.
<EOS>
The
coarse
black
gown
of
the
hospital
,
the
breeches
,
and
buckled
shoes
became
him
well
;
and
as
he
sat
with
his
hands
folded
on
his
staff
,
and
his
chin
resting
on
his
hands
,
he
was
such
a
listener
as
most
musicians
would
be
glad
to
welcome
.
  
<EOS>
This
man
was
certainly
the
pride
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
It
had
always
been
the
custom
that
one
should
be
selected
as
being
to
some
extent
in
authority
over
the
others
;
and
though
Mr
Bunce
,
for
such
was
his
name
,
and
so
he
was
always
designated
by
his
inferior
brethren
,
had
no
greater
emoluments
than
they
,
he
had
assumed
,
and
well
knew
how
to
maintain
,
the
dignity
of
his
elevation
.
<EOS>
The
precentor
delighted
to
call
him
his
sub
-
warden
,
and
was
not
ashamed
,
occasionally
,
when
no
other
guest
was
there
,
to
bid
him
sit
down
by
the
same
parlour
fire
,
and
drink
the
full
glass
of
port
which
was
placed
near
him
.
<EOS>
Bunce
never
went
without
the
second
glass
,
but
no
entreaty
ever
made
him
take
a
third
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
Mr
Harding
;
you
're
too
good
,
much
too
good
,
"
he
'd
always
say
,
as
the
second
glass
was
filled
;
but
when
that
was
drunk
,
and
the
half
hour
over
,
Bunce
stood
erect
,
and
with
a
benediction
which
his
patron
valued
,
retired
to
his
own
abode
.
<EOS>
He
knew
the
world
too
well
to
risk
the
comfort
of
such
halcyon
moments
,
by
prolonging
them
till
they
were
disagreeable
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Bunce
,
as
may
be
imagined
,
was
most
strongly
opposed
to
innovation
.
<EOS>
Not
even
Dr
Grantly
had
a
more
holy
horror
of
those
who
would
interfere
in
the
affairs
of
the
hospital
;
he
was
every
inch
a
churchman
,
and
though
he
was
not
very
fond
of
Dr
<EOS>
Grantly
personally
,
that
arose
from
there
not
being
room
in
the
hospital
for
two
people
so
much
alike
as
the
doctor
and
himself
,
rather
than
from
any
dissimilarity
in
feeling
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bunce
was
inclined
to
think
that
the
warden
and
himself
could
manage
the
hospital
without
further
assistance
;
and
that
,
though
the
bishop
was
the
constitutional
visitor
,
and
as
such
entitled
to
special
reverence
from
all
connected
with
John
Hiram
's
will
,
John
Hiram
never
intended
that
his
affairs
should
be
interfered
with
by
an
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
present
moment
,
however
,
these
cares
were
off
his
mind
,
and
he
was
looking
at
his
warden
,
as
though
he
thought
the
music
heavenly
,
and
the
musician
hardly
less
so
.
  
<EOS>
As
Bold
walked
silently
over
the
lawn
,
Mr
Harding
did
not
at
first
perceive
him
,
and
continued
to
draw
his
bow
slowly
across
the
plaintive
wires
;
but
he
soon
found
from
his
audience
that
some
stranger
was
there
,
and
looking
up
,
began
to
welcome
his
young
friend
with
frank
hospitality
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
Mr
Harding
 
pray
do
n't
let
me
disturb
you
,
"
said
Bold
;
<EOS>
"
you
know
how
fond
I
am
of
sacred
music
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
it
's
nothing
,
"
said
the
precentor
,
shutting
up
the
book
and
then
opening
it
again
as
he
saw
the
delightfully
imploring
look
of
his
old
friend
Bunce
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Bunce
,
Bunce
,
Bunce
,
I
fear
that
after
all
thou
art
but
a
flatterer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
'll
just
finish
it
then
;
it
's
a
favourite
little
bit
of
Bishop
's
;
and
then
,
Mr
Bold
,
we
'll
have
a
stroll
and
a
chat
till
Eleanor
comes
in
and
gives
us
tea
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
Bold
sat
down
on
the
soft
turf
to
listen
,
or
rather
to
think
how
,
after
such
sweet
harmony
,
he
might
best
introduce
a
theme
of
so
much
discord
,
to
disturb
the
peace
of
him
who
was
so
ready
to
welcome
him
kindly
.
  
<EOS>
Bold
thought
that
the
performance
was
soon
over
,
for
he
felt
that
he
had
a
somewhat
difficult
task
,
and
he
almost
regretted
the
final
leave
-
taking
of
the
last
of
the
old
men
,
slow
as
they
were
in
going
through
their
adieux
.
  
<EOS>
Bold
's
heart
was
in
his
mouth
,
as
the
precentor
made
some
ordinary
but
kind
remark
as
to
the
friendliness
of
the
visit
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
evening
call
,
"
said
he
,
"
is
worth
ten
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
formality
in
the
morning
;
real
social
talk
never
begins
till
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
That
's
why
I
dine
early
,
so
as
to
get
as
much
as
I
can
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
true
,
Mr
Harding
,
"
said
the
other
;
"
but
I
fear
I
've
reversed
the
order
of
things
,
and
I
owe
you
much
apology
for
troubling
you
on
business
at
such
an
hour
;
but
it
is
on
business
that
I
have
called
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
looked
blank
and
annoyed
;
there
was
something
in
the
tone
of
the
young
man
's
voice
which
told
him
that
the
interview
was
intended
to
be
disagreeable
,
and
he
shrank
back
at
finding
his
kindly
greeting
so
repulsed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
speak
to
you
about
the
hospital
,
"
continued
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
anything
I
can
tell
you
I
shall
be
most
happy
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
about
the
accounts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
my
dear
fellow
,
I
can
tell
you
nothing
,
for
I
'm
as
ignorant
as
a
child
.
<EOS>
All
I
know
is
,
that
they
pay
me
£
800
a
year
.
<EOS>
Go
to
Chadwick
,
he
knows
all
about
the
accounts
;
and
now
tell
me
,
will
poor
Mary
Jones
ever
get
the
use
of
her
limb
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
think
she
will
,
if
she
's
careful
;
but
,
Mr
Harding
,
I
hope
you
wo
n't
object
to
discuss
with
me
what
I
have
to
say
about
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
gave
a
deep
,
long
-
drawn
sigh
.
<EOS>
He
did
object
,
very
strongly
object
,
to
discuss
any
such
subject
with
John
Bold
;
but
he
had
not
the
business
tact
of
Mr
Chadwick
,
and
did
not
know
how
to
relieve
himself
from
the
coming
evil
;
he
sighed
sadly
,
but
made
no
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
greatest
regard
for
you
,
Mr
Harding
,
"
continued
Bold
;
"
the
truest
respect
,
the
most
sincere
 
"
  
"
Thank
ye
,
thank
ye
,
Mr
Bold
,
"
interjaculated
the
precentor
somewhat
impatiently
;
"
I
'm
much
obliged
,
but
never
mind
that
;
I
'm
as
likely
to
be
in
the
wrong
as
another
man
,
 
quite
as
likely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Mr
Harding
,
I
must
express
what
I
feel
,
lest
you
should
think
there
is
personal
enmity
in
what
I
'm
going
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Personal
enmity
!
<EOS>
Going
to
do
!
<EOS>
Why
,
you
're
not
going
to
cut
my
throat
,
nor
put
me
into
the
Ecclesiastical
Court
!
"
  
<EOS>
Bold
tried
to
laugh
,
but
he
could
n't
.
<EOS>
He
was
quite
in
earnest
,
and
determined
in
his
course
,
and
could
n't
make
a
joke
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
walked
on
awhile
in
silence
before
he
recommenced
his
attack
,
during
which
Mr
Harding
,
who
had
still
the
bow
in
his
hand
,
played
rapidly
on
an
imaginary
violoncello
.
<EOS>
"
I
fear
there
is
reason
to
think
that
John
Hiram
's
will
is
not
carried
out
to
the
letter
,
Mr
Harding
,
"
said
the
young
man
at
last
;
"
and
I
have
been
asked
to
see
into
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
I
've
no
objection
on
earth
;
and
now
we
need
not
say
another
word
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
one
word
more
,
Mr
Harding
.
<EOS>
Chadwick
has
referred
me
to
Cox
and
Cummins
,
and
I
think
it
my
duty
to
apply
to
them
for
some
statement
about
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
In
what
I
do
I
may
appear
to
be
interfering
with
you
,
and
I
hope
you
will
forgive
me
for
doing
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Bold
,
"
said
the
other
,
stopping
,
and
speaking
with
some
solemnity
,
"
if
you
act
justly
,
say
nothing
in
this
matter
but
the
truth
,
and
use
no
unfair
weapons
in
carrying
out
your
purposes
,
I
shall
have
nothing
to
forgive
.
<EOS>
I
presume
you
think
I
am
not
entitled
to
the
income
I
receive
from
the
hospital
,
and
that
others
are
entitled
to
it
.
<EOS>
Whatever
some
may
do
,
I
shall
never
attribute
to
you
base
motives
because
you
hold
an
opinion
opposed
to
my
own
and
adverse
to
my
interests
:
<EOS>
pray
do
what
you
consider
to
be
your
duty
;
I
can
give
you
no
assistance
,
neither
will
I
offer
you
any
obstacle
.
<EOS>
Let
me
,
however
,
suggest
to
you
,
that
you
can
in
no
wise
forward
your
views
nor
I
mine
,
by
any
discussion
between
us
.
<EOS>
Here
comes
Eleanor
and
the
ponies
,
and
we
'll
go
in
to
tea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bold
,
however
,
felt
that
he
could
not
sit
down
at
ease
with
Mr
Harding
and
his
daughter
after
what
had
passed
,
and
therefore
excused
himself
with
much
awkward
apology
;
and
merely
raising
his
hat
and
bowing
as
he
passed
Eleanor
and
the
pony
chair
,
left
her
in
disappointed
amazement
at
his
departure
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
's
demeanour
certainly
impressed
Bold
with
a
full
conviction
that
the
warden
felt
that
he
stood
on
strong
grounds
,
and
almost
made
him
think
that
he
was
about
to
interfere
without
due
warrant
in
the
private
affairs
of
a
just
and
honourable
man
;
but
Mr
Harding
himself
was
anything
but
satisfied
with
his
own
view
of
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
he
wished
for
Eleanor
's
sake
to
think
well
of
Bold
and
to
like
him
,
and
yet
he
could
not
but
feel
disgusted
at
the
arrogance
of
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
What
right
had
he
to
say
that
John
Hiram
's
will
was
not
fairly
carried
out
?
<EOS>
But
then
the
question
would
arise
within
his
heart
,
 
<EOS>
Was
that
will
fairly
acted
on
?
<EOS>
Did
John
Hiram
mean
that
the
warden
of
his
hospital
should
receive
considerably
more
out
of
the
legacy
than
all
the
twelve
old
men
together
for
whose
behoof
the
hospital
was
built
?
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
that
John
Bold
was
right
,
and
that
the
reverend
warden
of
the
hospital
had
been
for
the
last
ten
years
and
more
the
unjust
recipient
of
an
income
legally
and
equitably
belonging
to
others
?
<EOS>
What
if
it
should
be
proved
before
the
light
of
day
that
he
,
whose
life
had
been
so
happy
,
so
quiet
,
so
respected
,
had
absorbed
eight
thousand
pounds
to
which
he
had
no
title
,
and
which
he
could
never
repay
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
that
he
feared
that
such
was
really
the
case
;
but
the
first
shade
of
doubt
now
fell
across
his
mind
,
and
from
this
evening
,
for
many
a
long
,
long
day
,
our
good
,
kind
loving
warden
was
neither
happy
nor
at
ease
.
  
<EOS>
Thoughts
of
this
kind
,
these
first
moments
of
much
misery
,
oppressed
Mr
Harding
as
he
sat
sipping
his
tea
,
absent
and
ill
at
ease
.
<EOS>
Poor
Eleanor
felt
that
all
was
not
right
,
but
her
ideas
as
to
the
cause
of
the
evening
's
discomfort
did
not
go
beyond
her
lover
,
and
his
sudden
and
uncivil
departure
.
<EOS>
She
thought
there
must
have
been
some
quarrel
between
Bold
and
her
father
,
and
she
was
half
angry
with
both
,
though
she
did
not
attempt
to
explain
to
herself
why
she
was
so
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
thought
long
and
deeply
over
these
things
,
both
before
he
went
to
bed
and
after
it
,
as
he
lay
awake
,
questioning
within
himself
the
validity
of
his
claim
to
the
income
which
he
enjoyed
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
clear
at
any
rate
that
,
however
unfortunate
he
might
be
at
having
been
placed
in
such
a
position
,
no
one
could
say
that
he
ought
either
to
have
refused
the
appointment
first
,
or
to
have
rejected
the
income
afterwards
.
<EOS>
All
the
world
,
 
meaning
the
ecclesiastical
world
as
confined
to
the
English
church
<EOS>
,
 
knew
that
the
wardenship
of
the
Barchester
Hospital
was
a
snug
sinecure
,
but
no
one
had
ever
been
blamed
for
accepting
it
.
<EOS>
To
how
much
blame
,
however
,
would
he
have
been
open
had
he
rejected
it
!
<EOS>
How
mad
would
he
have
been
thought
had
he
declared
,
when
the
situation
was
vacant
and
offered
to
him
,
that
he
had
scruples
as
to
receiving
£
800
a
year
from
John
Hiram
's
property
,
and
that
he
had
rather
some
stranger
should
possess
it
!
<EOS>
How
would
Dr
Grantly
have
shaken
his
wise
head
,
and
have
consulted
with
his
friends
in
the
close
as
to
some
decent
retreat
for
the
coming
insanity
of
the
poor
minor
canon
!
<EOS>
If
he
was
right
in
accepting
the
place
,
it
was
clear
to
him
also
that
he
would
be
wrong
in
rejecting
any
part
of
the
income
attached
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
patronage
was
a
valuable
appanage
of
the
bishopric
;
and
surely
it
would
not
be
his
duty
to
lessen
the
value
of
that
preferment
which
had
been
bestowed
on
himself
;
surely
he
was
bound
to
stand
by
his
order
.
  
<EOS>
But
somehow
these
arguments
,
though
they
seemed
logical
,
were
not
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
Was
<EOS>
John
Hiram
's
will
fairly
carried
out
?
<EOS>
that
was
the
true
question
:
and
if
not
,
was
it
not
his
especial
duty
to
see
that
this
was
done
,
 
<EOS>
his
especial
duty
,
whatever
injury
it
might
do
to
his
order
,
 
however
ill
such
duty
might
be
received
by
his
patron
and
his
friends
?
<EOS>
At
the
idea
of
his
friends
,
his
mind
turned
unhappily
to
his
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
He
knew
well
how
strongly
he
would
be
supported
by
Dr
<EOS>
Grantly
,
if
he
could
bring
himself
to
put
his
case
into
the
archdeacon
's
hands
and
to
allow
him
to
fight
the
battle
;
<EOS>
but
he
knew
also
that
he
would
find
no
sympathy
there
for
his
doubts
,
no
friendly
feeling
,
no
inward
comfort
.
<EOS>
Dr
Grantly
would
be
ready
enough
to
take
up
his
cudgel
against
all
comers
on
behalf
of
the
church
militant
,
but
he
would
do
so
on
the
distasteful
ground
of
the
church
's
infallibility
.
<EOS>
Such
a
contest
would
give
no
comfort
to
Mr
Harding
's
doubts
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
so
anxious
to
prove
himself
right
,
as
to
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
said
before
that
<EOS>
Dr
Grantly
was
the
working
man
of
the
diocese
,
and
that
his
father
the
bishop
was
somewhat
inclined
to
an
idle
life
.
<EOS>
So
it
was
;
but
the
bishop
,
though
he
had
never
been
an
active
man
,
was
one
whose
qualities
had
rendered
him
dear
to
all
who
knew
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
very
opposite
to
his
son
;
he
was
a
bland
and
a
kind
old
man
,
opposed
by
every
feeling
to
authoritative
demonstrations
and
episcopal
ostentation
.
<EOS>
It
was
perhaps
well
for
him
,
in
his
situation
,
that
his
son
had
early
in
life
been
able
to
do
that
which
he
could
not
well
do
when
he
was
younger
,
and
which
he
could
not
have
done
at
all
now
that
he
was
over
seventy
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
knew
how
to
entertain
the
clergy
of
his
diocese
,
to
talk
easy
small
-
talk
with
the
rectors
'
wives
,
and
put
curates
at
their
ease
;
but
it
required
the
strong
hand
of
the
archdeacon
to
deal
with
such
as
were
refractory
either
in
their
doctrines
or
their
lives
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
and
Mr
Harding
loved
each
other
warmly
.
<EOS>
They
had
grown
old
together
,
and
had
together
spent
many
,
many
years
in
clerical
pursuits
and
clerical
conversation
.
<EOS>
When
one
of
them
was
a
bishop
and
the
other
only
a
minor
canon
<EOS>
they
were
even
then
much
together
;
but
since
their
children
had
married
,
and
Mr
Harding
had
become
warden
and
precentor
,
they
were
all
in
all
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
they
managed
the
diocese
between
them
,
but
they
spent
much
time
in
discussing
the
man
who
did
,
and
in
forming
little
plans
to
mitigate
his
wrath
against
church
delinquents
,
and
soften
his
aspirations
for
church
dominion
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
determined
to
open
his
mind
and
confess
his
doubts
to
his
old
friend
;
and
to
him
he
went
on
the
morning
after
John
Bold
's
uncourteous
visit
.
  
<EOS>
Up
to
this
period
no
rumour
of
these
cruel
proceedings
against
the
hospital
had
reached
the
bishop
's
ears
.
<EOS>
He
had
doubtless
heard
that
men
existed
who
questioned
his
right
to
present
to
a
sinecure
of
£
800
a
year
,
as
he
had
heard
from
time
to
time
of
some
special
immorality
or
disgraceful
disturbance
in
the
usually
decent
and
quiet
city
of
Barchester
:
but
all
he
did
,
and
all
he
was
called
on
to
do
,
on
such
occasions
,
was
to
shake
his
head
,
and
to
beg
his
son
,
the
great
dictator
,
to
see
that
no
harm
happened
to
the
church
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
story
that
Mr
Harding
had
to
tell
before
he
made
the
bishop
comprehend
his
own
view
of
the
case
;
but
we
need
not
follow
him
through
the
tale
.
<EOS>
At
first
the
bishop
counselled
but
one
step
,
recommended
but
one
remedy
,
had
but
one
medicine
in
his
whole
pharmacopoeia
strong
enough
to
touch
so
grave
a
disorder
;
 
<EOS>
he
prescribed
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
Refer
him
to
the
archdeacon
,
"
he
repeated
,
as
Mr
Harding
spoke
of
Bold
and
his
visit
.
"
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
will
set
you
quite
right
about
that
,
"
he
kindly
said
,
when
his
friend
spoke
with
hesitation
of
the
justness
of
his
cause
.
<EOS>
"
No
man
has
got
up
all
that
so
well
as
the
archdeacon
;
"
but
the
dose
,
though
large
,
failed
to
quiet
the
patient
;
indeed
it
almost
produced
nausea
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
bishop
,
"
said
he
,
"
did
you
ever
read
John
Hiram
's
will
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
thought
probably
he
had
,
thirty
-
five
years
ago
,
when
first
instituted
to
his
see
,
but
could
not
state
positively
:
however
,
he
very
well
knew
that
he
had
the
absolute
right
to
present
to
the
wardenship
,
and
that
the
income
of
the
warden
had
been
regularly
settled
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
bishop
,
the
question
is
,
who
has
the
power
to
settle
it
?
<EOS>
If
,
as
this
young
man
says
,
the
will
provides
that
the
proceeds
of
the
property
are
to
be
divided
into
shares
,
who
has
the
power
to
alter
these
provisions
?
<EOS>
"
The
bishop
had
an
indistinct
idea
that
they
altered
themselves
by
the
lapse
of
years
;
that
a
kind
of
ecclesiastical
statute
of
limitation
barred
the
rights
of
the
twelve
bedesmen
to
any
increase
of
income
arising
from
the
increased
value
of
property
.
<EOS>
He
said
something
about
tradition
;
more
of
the
many
learned
men
who
by
their
practice
had
confirmed
the
present
arrangement
;
then
went
at
some
length
into
the
propriety
of
maintaining
the
due
difference
in
rank
and
income
between
a
beneficed
clergyman
and
certain
poor
old
men
who
were
dependent
on
charity
;
and
concluded
his
argument
by
another
reference
to
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
The
precentor
sat
thoughtfully
gazing
at
the
fire
,
and
listening
to
the
good
-
natured
reasoning
of
his
friend
.
<EOS>
What
the
bishop
said
had
a
sort
of
comfort
in
it
,
but
it
was
not
a
sustaining
comfort
.
<EOS>
It
made
Mr
Harding
feel
that
many
others
,
 
indeed
,
all
others
of
his
own
order
,
 
would
think
him
right
;
but
it
failed
to
prove
to
him
that
he
truly
was
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bishop
,
"
said
he
,
<EOS>
at
last
,
after
both
had
sat
silent
for
a
while
,
"
I
should
deceive
you
and
myself
too
,
if
I
did
not
tell
you
that
I
am
very
unhappy
about
this
.
<EOS>
Suppose
that
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
agree
with
Dr
Grantly
!
 
<EOS>
that
I
find
,
after
inquiry
,
that
the
young
man
is
right
,
and
that
I
am
wrong
,
 
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
two
old
men
were
sitting
near
each
other
,
 
so
near
that
the
bishop
was
able
to
lay
his
hand
upon
the
other
's
knee
,
and
he
did
so
with
a
gentle
pressure
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
well
knew
what
that
pressure
meant
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
had
no
further
argument
to
adduce
;
he
could
not
fight
for
the
cause
as
his
son
would
do
;
he
could
not
prove
all
the
precentor
's
doubts
to
be
groundless
;
but
he
could
sympathise
with
his
friend
,
and
he
did
so
;
and
Mr
Harding
felt
that
he
had
received
that
for
which
he
came
.
<EOS>
There
was
another
period
of
silence
,
after
which
the
bishop
asked
,
with
a
degree
of
irritable
energy
,
very
unusual
with
him
,
whether
this
"
pestilent
intruder
"
(
meaning
John
Bold
)
had
any
friends
in
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
had
fully
made
up
his
mind
to
tell
the
bishop
everything
;
to
speak
of
his
daughter
's
love
,
as
well
as
his
own
troubles
;
to
talk
of
John
Bold
in
his
double
capacity
of
future
son
-
in
-
law
and
present
enemy
;
and
though
he
felt
it
to
be
sufficiently
disagreeable
,
now
was
his
time
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
very
intimate
at
my
own
house
,
bishop
.
<EOS>
"
The
bishop
stared
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
so
far
gone
in
orthodoxy
and
church
militancy
as
his
son
,
but
still
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
understand
how
so
declared
an
enemy
of
the
establishment
could
be
admitted
on
terms
of
intimacy
into
the
house
,
not
only
of
so
firm
a
pillar
as
Mr
Harding
,
but
one
so
much
injured
as
the
warden
of
the
hospital
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
I
like
Mr
Bold
much
,
personally
,
"
continued
the
disinterested
victim
;
"
and
to
tell
you
the
"
truth
,
"
"
 
he
hesitated
as
he
brought
out
the
dreadful
tidings
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
sometimes
thought
it
not
improbable
that
he
would
be
my
second
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"
The
bishop
did
not
whistle
:
we
believe
that
they
lose
the
power
of
doing
so
on
being
consecrated
;
and
that
in
these
days
one
might
as
easily
meet
a
corrupt
judge
as
a
whistling
bishop
;
but
he
looked
as
though
he
would
have
done
so
,
but
for
his
apron
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
brother
-
in
-
law
for
the
archdeacon
!
<EOS>
what
an
alliance
for
Barchester
close
!
<EOS>
what
a
connection
for
even
the
episcopal
palace
!
<EOS>
The
bishop
,
in
his
simple
mind
,
felt
no
doubt
that
John
Bold
,
had
he
so
much
power
,
would
shut
up
all
cathedrals
,
and
probably
all
parish
churches
;
distribute
all
tithes
among
Methodists
,
Baptists
,
and
other
savage
tribes
;
utterly
annihilate
the
sacred
bench
,
and
make
shovel
hats
and
lawn
sleeves
as
illegal
as
cowls
,
sandals
,
and
sackcloth
!
<EOS>
Here
was
a
nice
man
to
be
initiated
into
the
comfortable
arcana
of
ecclesiastical
snuggeries
;
one
who
doubted
the
integrity
of
parsons
,
and
probably
disbelieved
the
Trinity
!
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
saw
what
an
effect
his
communication
had
made
,
and
almost
repented
the
openness
of
his
disclosure
;
he
,
however
,
did
what
he
could
to
moderate
the
grief
of
his
friend
and
patron
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
that
there
is
any
engagement
between
them
.
<EOS>
Had
there
been
,
Eleanor
would
have
told
me
;
I
know
her
well
enough
to
be
assured
that
she
would
have
done
so
;
but
I
see
that
they
are
fond
of
each
other
;
and
as
a
man
and
a
father
,
I
have
had
no
objection
to
urge
against
their
intimacy
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
,
Mr
Harding
,
"
said
the
bishop
,
"
how
are
you
to
oppose
him
,
if
he
is
your
son
-
in
-
law
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
to
oppose
him
;
it
is
he
who
opposes
me
;
if
anything
is
to
be
done
in
defence
,
I
suppose
Chadwick
will
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
 
"
  
"
Oh
,
the
archdeacon
will
see
to
that
:
were
the
young
man
twice
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
the
archdeacon
will
never
be
deterred
from
doing
what
he
feels
to
be
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
reminded
the
bishop
that
the
archdeacon
and
the
reformer
were
not
yet
brothers
,
and
very
probably
never
would
be
;
exacted
from
him
a

's

should
not

in

between

archdeacon
respecting

amazed

HIRAM
'S
BEDESMEN
 
<EOS>
The
parties
most
interested
in
the
movement
which
is
about
to
set
Barchester
by
the
ears
were
not
the
foremost
to
discuss
the
merit
of
the
question
,
as
is
often
the
case
;
but
when
the
bishop
,
the
archdeacon
,
the
warden
,
the
steward
,
and
Messrs
Cox
and
Cummins
,
were
all
busy
with
the
matter
,
each
in
his
own
way
,
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
Hiram
's
bedesmen
themselves
were
altogether
passive
spectators
.
<EOS>
Finney
,
the
attorney
,
had
been
among
them
,
asking
sly
questions
,
and
raising
immoderate
hopes
,
creating
a
party
hostile
to
the
warden
,
and
establishing
a
corps
in
the
enemy
's
camp
,
as
he
figuratively
calls
it
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Poor
old
men
:
whoever
may
be
righted
or
wronged
by
this
inquiry
<EOS>
,
they
at
any
rate
will
assuredly
be
only
injured
:
to
them
it
can
only
be
an
unmixed
evil
.
<EOS>
How
can
their
lot
be
improved
?
<EOS>
all
their
wants
are
supplied
;
every
comfort
is
administered
;
they
have
warm
houses
,
good
clothes
,
plentiful
diet
,
and
rest
after
a
life
of
labour
;
and
above
all
,
that
treasure
so
inestimable
in
declining
years
,
a
true
and
kind
friend
to
listen
to
their
sorrows
,
watch
over
their
sickness
,
and
administer
comfort
as
regards
this
world
,
and
the
world
to
come
!
  
<EOS>
John
Bold
sometimes
thinks
of
this
,
when
he
is
talking
loudly
of
the
rights
of
the
bedesmen
,
whom
he
has
taken
under
his
protection
;
but
he
quiets
the
suggestion
within
his
breast
with
the
high
-
sounding
name
of
justice
:
"
_
Fiat
justitia
,
ruat
coelum
_
.
<EOS>
"
These
old
men
should
,
by
rights
,
have
one
hundred
pounds
a
year
instead
of
one
shilling
and
sixpence
a
day
,
and
the
warden
should
have
two
hundred
or
three
hundred
pounds
instead
of
eight
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
What
is
unjust
must
be
wrong
;
what
is
wrong
should
be
righted
;
and
if
he
declined
the
task
,
who
else
would
do
it
?
  
<EOS>
"
Each
one
of
you
is
clearly
entitled
to
one
hundred
pounds
a
year
by
common
law
"
:
<EOS>
such
had
been
the
important
whisper
made
by
Finney
into
the
ears
of
Abel
Handy
,
and
by
him
retailed
to
his
eleven
brethren
.
  
<EOS>
Too
much
must
not
be
expected
from
the
flesh
and
blood
even
of
John
Hiram
's
bedesmen
,
and
the
positive
promise
of
one
hundred
a
year
to
each
of
the
twelve
old
men
had
its
way
with
most
of
them
.
<EOS>
The
great
Bunce
was
not
to
be
wiled
away
,
and
was
upheld
in
his
orthodoxy
by
two
adherents
.
<EOS>
Abel
Handy
,
who
was
the
leader
of
the
aspirants
after
wealth
,
had
,
alas
,
a
stronger
following
.
<EOS>
No
less
than
five
of
the
twelve
soon
believed
that
his
views
were
just
,
making
with
their
leader
a
moiety
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
The
other
three
,
volatile
unstable
minds
,
vacillated
between
the
two
chieftains
,
now
led
away
by
the
hope
of
gold
,
now
anxious
to
propitiate
the
powers
that
still
existed
.
  
<EOS>
It
had
been
proposed
to
address
a
petition
to
the
bishop
as
visitor
,
praying
his
lordship
to
see
justice
done
to
the
legal
recipients
of
John
Hiram
's
Charity
,
and
to
send
copies
of
this
petition
and
of
the
reply
it
would
elicit
to
all
the
leading
London
papers
,
and
thereby
to
obtain
notoriety
for
the
subject
.
<EOS>
This
it
was
thought
would
pave
the
way
for
ulterior
legal
proceedings
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
a
great
thing
to
have
had
the
signatures
and
marks
of
all
the
twelve
injured
legatees
;
but
this
was
impossible
:
Bunce
would
have
cut
his
hand
off
sooner
than
have
signed
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
suggested
by
Finney
that
if
even
eleven
could
be
induced
to
sanction
the
document
,
the
one
obstinate
recusant
might
have
been
represented
as
unfit
to
judge
on
such
a
question
,
 
in
fact
,
as
being
_
non
compos
mentis
_
,
 
and
the
petition
would
have
been
taken
as
representing
the
feeling
of
the
men
.
<EOS>
But
this
could
not
be
done
:
Bunce
's
friends
were
as
firm
as
himself
,
and
as
yet
only
six
crosses
adorned
the
document
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
more
provoking
,
as
Bunce
himself
could
write
his
name
legibly
,
and
one
of
those
three
doubting
souls
had
for
years
boasted
of
like
power
,
and
possessed
,
indeed
,
a
Bible
,
in
which
he
was
proud
to
show
his
name
written
by
himself
some
thirty
years
ago
 
"
Job
Skulpit
;
"
but
it
was
thought
that
Job
Skulpit
,
having
forgotten
his
scholarship
,
on
that
account
recoiled
from
the
petition
,
and
that
the
other
doubters
would
follow
as
he
led
them
.
<EOS>
A
petition
signed
by
half
the
hospital
would
have
but
a
poor
effect
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
in
Skulpit
's
room
that
the
petition
was
now
lying
,
waiting
such
additional
signatures
as
Abel
Handy
,
by
his
eloquence
,
could
obtain
for
it
.
<EOS>
The
six
marks
it
bore
were
duly
attested
,
thus
:
  
<EOS>
his
his
his
Abel
X
Handy
,
Gregy
X
Moody
,
Mathew
X
Spriggs
,
mark
mark
mark
  
&
c.
,
and
places
were
duly
designated
in
pencil
for
those
brethren
who
were
now
expected
to
join
:
for
Skulpit
alone
was
left
a
spot
on
which
his
genuine
signature
might
be
written
in
fair
clerk
-
like
style
.
<EOS>
Handy
had
brought
in
the
document
,
and
spread
it
out
on
the
small
deal
table
,
and
was
now
standing
by
it
persuasive
and
eager
.
<EOS>
Moody
had
followed
with
an
inkhorn
,
carefully
left
behind
by
Finney
;
and
Spriggs
bore
aloft
,
as
though
it
were
a
sword
,
a
well
-
worn
ink
-
black
pen
,
which
from
time
to
time
he
endeavoured
to
thrust
into
Skulpit
's
unwilling
hand
.
  
<EOS>
With
the
learned
man
were
his
two
abettors
in
indecision
,
William
Gazy
and
Jonathan
Crumple
.
<EOS>
If
ever
the
petition
were
to
be
forwarded
,
now
was
the
time
,
 
so
said
Mr
Finney
;
and
great
was
the
anxiety
on
the
part
of
those
whose
one
hundred
pounds
a
year
,
as
they
believed
,
mainly
depended
on
the
document
in
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
kept
out
of
all
that
money
,
"
as
the
avaricious
Moody
had
muttered
to
his
friend
Handy
,
"
by
an
old
fool
saying
that
he
can
write
his
own
name
like
his
betters
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Job
,
"
said
Handy
,
trying
to
impart
to
his
own
sour
,
ill
-
omened
visage
a
smile
of
approbation
,
in
which
he
greatly
failed
;
"
so
you
're
ready
now
,
Mr
Finney
says
;
here
's
the
place
,
d'ye
see
;
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
put
his
huge
brown
finger
down
on
the
dirty
paper
;
 
"
name
or
mark
<EOS>
,
it
's
all
one
.
<EOS>
Come
along
,
old
boy
;
if
so
be
<EOS>
we
're
to
have
the
spending
of
this
money
,
why
the
sooner
the
better
,
 
that
's
my
maxim
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
be
sure
,
"
said
Moody
.
<EOS>
"
We
a'n"t
<EOS>
none
of
us
so
young
;
we
ca
n't
stay
waiting
for
old
Catgut
no
longer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
thus
these
miscreants
named
our
excellent
friend
.
<EOS>
The
nickname
he
could
easily
have
forgiven
,
but
the
allusion
to
the
divine
source
of
all
his
melodious
joy
would
have
irritated
even
him
.
<EOS>
Let
us
hope
he
never
knew
the
insult
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
think
,
old
Billy
Gazy
,
"
said
Spriggs
,
who
rejoiced
in
greater
youth
than
his
brethren
,
but
having
fallen
into
a
fire
when
drunk
,
had
had
one
eye
burnt
out
,
one
cheek
burnt
through
,
and
one
arm
nearly
burnt
off
,
and
who
,
therefore
,
in
regard
to
personal
appearance
,
was
not
the
most
prepossessing
of
men
,
"
a
hundred
a
year
,
and
all
to
spend
;
only
think
,
old
Billy
Gazy
;
"
and
he
gave
a
hideous
grin
that
showed
off
his
misfortunes
to
their
full
extent
.
  
<EOS>
Old
Billy
Gazy
was
not
alive
to
much
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
Even
these
golden
prospects
did
not
arouse
him
to
do
more
than
rub
his
poor
old
bleared
eyes
with
the
cuff
of
his
bedesman
's
gown
,
and
gently
mutter
:
<EOS>
"
he
did
n't
know
,
not
he
;
he
did
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
'd
know
,
Jonathan
,
"
continued
Spriggs
,
turning
to
the
other
friend
of
Skulpit
's
,
who
was
sitting
on
a
stool
by
the
table
,
gazing
vacantly
at
the
petition
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
Crumple
was
a
meek
,
mild
man
,
who
had
known
better
days
;
his
means
had
been
wasted
by
bad
children
,
who
had
made
his
life
wretched
till
he
had
been
received
into
the
hospital
,
of
which
he
had
not
long
been
a
member
.
<EOS>
Since
that
day
he
had
known
neither
sorrow
nor
trouble
,
and
this
attempt
to
fill
him
with
new
hopes
was
,
indeed
,
a
cruelty
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
hundred
a
year
's
a
nice
thing
,
for
sartain
,
neighbour
Spriggs
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
once
had
nigh
to
that
myself
,
but
it
did
n't
do
me
no
good
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
gave
a
low
sigh
,
as
he
thought
of
the
children
of
his
own
loins
who
had
robbed
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
shall
have
again
,
Joe
,
"
said
Handy
;
"
and
will
have
someone
to
keep
it
right
and
tight
for
you
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Crumple
sighed
again
;
 
he
had
learned
the
impotency
of
worldly
wealth
,
and
would
have
been
satisfied
,
if
left
untempted
,
to
have
remained
happy
with
one
and
sixpence
a
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Skulpit
,
"
repeated
Handy
,
getting
impatient
,
"
you
're
not
going
to
go
along
with
old
Bunce
in
helping
that
parson
to
rob
us
all
.
<EOS>
Take
the
pen
,
man
,
and
right
yourself
.
<EOS>
Well
,
"
he
added
,
seeing
that
Skulpit
still
doubted
,
"
to
see
a
man
as
is
afraid
to
stand
by
hisself
is
,
to
my
thinking
,
the
meanest
thing
as
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sink
them
all
for
parsons
,
says
I
,
"
growled
Moody
;
"
hungry
beggars
,
as
never
thinks
their
bellies
full
till
they
have
robbed
all
and
everything
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
to
harm
you
,
man
?
"
argued
Spriggs
.
<EOS>
"
Let
them
look
never
so
black
at
you
,
they
ca
n't
get
you
put
out
when
you
're
once
in
;
 
no
,
<EOS>
not
old
Catgut
,
with
Calves
to
help
him
!
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
say
the
archdeacon
himself
was
designated
by
this
scurrilous
allusion
to
his
nether
person
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
hundred
a
year
to
win
,
and
nothing
to
lose
,
"
continued
Handy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
eyes
!
<EOS>
Well
,
how
a
man
's
to
doubt
about
sich
a
bit
of
cheese
as
that
passes
me
;
 
but
some
men
is
timorous
;
 
some
men
is
born
with
no
pluck
in
them
;
 
some
men
is
cowed
at
the
very
first
sight
of
a
gentleman
's
coat
and
waistcoat
.
"
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mr
Harding
,
if
you
had
but
taken
the
archdeacon
's
advice
in
that
disputed
case
,
when
Joe
Mutters
was
this
ungrateful
demagogue
's
rival
candidate
!
  
<EOS>
"
Afraid
of
a
parson
,
"
growled
Moody
,
with
a
look
of
ineffable
scorn
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
ye
what
I
'd
be
afraid
of
 
<EOS>
I
'd
be
afraid
of
not
getting
nothing
from
'em
<EOS>
but
just
what
I
could
take
by
might
and
right
;
 
<EOS>
that
's
the
most
I
'd
be
afraid
on
of
any
parson
of
'em
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
said
Skulpit
,
apologetically
,
"
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
's
not
so
bad
;
 
he
did
give
us
twopence
a
day
,
did
n't
he
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Twopence
a
day
!
"
exclaimed
Spriggs
with
scorn
,
opening
awfully
the
red
cavern
of
his
lost
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
Twopence
a
day
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Moody
with
a
curse
;
"
sink
his
twopence
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Twopence
a
day
!
"
exclaimed
Handy
;
"
and
I
'm
to
go
,
hat
in
hand
,
and
thank
a
chap
for
twopence
a
day
,
when
he
owes
me
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
;
no
,
thank
ye
;
that
may
do
for
you

but
it
wo
n't

<EOS>
Come
,
I
say
,
Skulpit
,
are
you
a
going
to
put
your
mark
to
this
here
paper
,
or
are
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
Skulpit
looked
round
in
wretched
indecision
to
his
two
friends
.
<EOS>
"
What
d'ye
think
,
Bill
Gazy
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
But
Bill
Gazy
could
n't
think
.
<EOS>
He
made
a
noise
like
the
bleating
of
an
old
sheep
,
which
was
intended
to
express
the
agony
of
his
doubt
,
and
again
muttered
that
"
he
did
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Take
hold
,
you
old
cripple
,
"
said
Handy
,
thrusting
the
pen
into
poor
Billy
's
hand
:
"
there
,
<EOS>
so
 
ugh
!
<EOS>
you
old
fool
<EOS>

you

:
and
a
big
blotch
of
ink
was
presumed
to
represent
Billy
Gazy
's
acquiescence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now

Jonathan

said
Handy
,
turning
to
Crumple
.
  
<EOS>
"
A

again
argued
Crumple
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
neighbour
Skulpit

how
's
it
to

"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
please
yourself
,
"
said
Skulpit
:
"
please
yourself
,
and
you
'll
please
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
pen
was
thrust
into
Crumple
's
hand
,
and
a
faint
,
wandering
,
meaningless
sign
was
made
,
betokening
such
sanction
and
authority
as
Jonathan
Crumple
was
able
to
convey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Job
,
"
said
Handy
,
softened
by
success
,
"
do
n't
let
'em
have
to
say
that
old
Bunce
has
a
man
like
you
under
his
thumb
,
 
a
man
that
always
holds
his
head
in
the
hospital
as
high
as
Bunce
himself
,
though
you
're
never
axed
to
drink
wine
,
and
sneak
,
and
tell
lies
about
your
betters
as
he
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Skulpit
held
the
pen
,
and
made
little
flourishes
with
it
in
the
air
,
but
still
hesitated
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
you
'll
be
said
by
me
,
"
continued
Handy
,
"
you
'll
not
write
your
name
to
it
at
all
,
but
just
put
your
mark
like
the
others
;
"
 
the
cloud
began
to
clear
from
Skulpit
's
brow
;
 
<EOS>
"
we
all
know
you
can
do
it
if
you
like
,
but
maybe
you
would
n't
like
to
seem
uppish
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
the
mark
would
be
best
,
"
said
Skulpit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
One
name
and
the
rest
marks
would
n't
look
well
,
would
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
worst
in
the
world
,
"
said
Handy
;
"
there
 
there
"
:
and
stooping
over
the
petition
,
the
learned
clerk
made
a
huge
cross
on
the
place
left
for
his
signature
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
game
,
"
said
Handy
,
triumphantly
pocketing
the
petition
;
"
we
're
all
in
a
boat
now
,
that
is
,
the
nine
of
us
;
and
as
for
old
Bunce
,
and
his
cronies
,
they
may
 
<EOS>
"
But
as
he
was
hobbling
off
to
the
door
,
with
a
crutch
on
one
side
and
a
stick
on
the
other
,
he
was
met
by
Bunce
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
Handy
,
and
what
may
old
Bunce
do
?
"
said
the
gray
-
haired
,
upright
senior
.
  
<EOS>
Handy
muttered
something
,
and
was
departing
;
but
he
was
stopped
in
the
doorway
by
the
huge
frame
of
the
newcomer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
been
doing
no
good
here
,
Abel
Handy
,
"
said
he
,
"
'
tis
plain
to
see
that
;
and
'
tisn't
<EOS>
much
good
,
I
'm
thinking
,
you
ever
do

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mind
my
own
business
,
Master
Bunce
,
"
muttered
the
other
,
"
and
do
you
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
nothing
to
you
what
I
does
;
 
and
your
spying
and
poking
here
wo
n't
do
no
good
nor
yet
no
harm

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
then
,
Job
,
"
continued
Bunce
,
not
noticing
his
opponent
,
"
if
the
truth
must
out
,
you
've
stuck
your
name
to
that
petition
of
theirs
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Skulpit
looked
as
though
he
were
about
to
sink
into
the
ground
with
shame
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
to
you
what
he
signs
?
"
said
Handy
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
if
we
all
wants
to
ax
for
our
own
,
we
need
n't
ax
leave
of
you
first
,
Mr
Bunce
,
big
a
man
as
you
are
;
and
as
to
your
sneaking
in
here
,
into
Job
's
room
when
he
's
busy
,
and
where
you
're
not
wanted
 
"
  
"
I
've
knowed
Job
Skulpit
,
man
and
boy
,
sixty
years
,
"
said
Bunce
,
looking
at
the
man
of
whom
he
spoke
,
"
and
that
's
ever
since
the
day
he
was
born
.
<EOS>
I
knowed
the
mother
that
bore
him
,
when
she
and
I
were
little
wee
things
,
picking
daisies
together
in
the
close
yonder
;
and
I
've
lived
under
the
same
roof
with
him
more
nor
ten
years
;
and
after
that
I
may
come
into
his
room
without
axing
leave
,
and
yet
no
sneaking
neither
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
you
can
,
Mr
Bunce
,
"
said
Skulpit
;
"
so
you
can
,
any
hour
,
day
or
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
'm
free
also
to
tell
him
my
mind
,
"
continued
Bunce
,
looking
at
the
one
man
and
addressing
the
other
;
"
and
I
tell
him
now
that
he
's
done
a
foolish
and
a
wrong
thing
.
<EOS>
He
's
turned
his
back
upon
one
who
is
his
best
friend
;
and
is
playing
the
game
of
others
,
who
care
nothing
for
him
,
whether
he
be
poor
or
rich
,
well
or
ill
,
alive
or
dead
.
<EOS>
A
hundred
a
year
?
<EOS>
Are
the
lot
of
you
soft
enough
to
think
that
if
a
hundred
a
year
be
to
be
given
,
it
's
the
likes
of
you
that
will
get
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
pointed
to
Billy
Gazy
,
Spriggs
,
and
Crumple
.
<EOS>
"
Did
any
of
us
ever
do
anything
worth
half
the
money
?
<EOS>
Was
it
to
make
gentlemen
of
us
we
were
brought
in
here
,
when
all
the
world
turned
against
us
,
and
we
could
n't
longer
earn
our
daily
bread

<EOS>
A'n"t
<EOS>
you
all
as
rich
in
your
ways
as
he
in
his
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
the
orator
pointed
to
the
side
on
which
the
warden
lived
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A'n"t
<EOS>
you
getting
all
you
hoped
for

and
more
than
you
hoped
for

<EOS>
Would
n't
each
of
you
have
given
the
dearest
limb
of
his
body
to
secure
that
which
now
makes
you
so
unthankful
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
wants
what
John
Hiram
left
us
,
"
said
Handy
.
<EOS>
"
We
wants
what
's
ourn
by
law
;
it
do
n't
matter
what
we
expected
.
<EOS>
What
's
ourn

and
by

we
'll
have
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Law
!
<EOS>
"
said
Bunce
,
with
all
the
scorn
he
knew
how
to
command
 
"
law
!
<EOS>
Did
ye
ever
know
a
poor
man
yet

the
better
for

,
or
for
a
lawyer

<EOS>
Will
Mr
Finney
ever
be
as
good
to

,
Job
,
as
that
man
has
been
?
<EOS>
Will
he
see
to
you
when
you
're
sick
,
and
comfort
you
when
you
're
wretched
?
<EOS>
Will
<EOS>
he
 
"
  
"
No
,
nor
give
you
port
wine
,
old
boy
,
on
cold
winter
nights
!
<EOS>
he
wo
n't
do
that
,
will
he
?
"
asked
Handy
;
and
laughing
at
the
severity
of
his
own
wit
,
he
and
his
colleagues
retired
,
carrying
with
them
,
however
,
the
now
powerful
petition
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
no
help
for
spilt
milk
;
and
Mr
Bunce
could
only
retire
to
his
own
room
,
disgusted
at
the
frailty
of
human
nature
.
<EOS>
Job
Skulpit
scratched
his
head
;
 
Jonathan
Crumple
again
remarked
,
that
,
"
for
sartain
,
sure
a
hundred
a
year
was
very
nice
;
"
 
and
Billy
Gazy
again
rubbed
his
eyes
,
and
lowly
muttered
that
"
he
did
n't
know

<EOS>
DR
GRANTLY
VISITS
<EOS>
THE
HOSPITAL
 
<EOS>
Though
doubt
and
hesitation
disturbed
the
rest
of
our
poor
warden
,
no
such
weakness
perplexed
the
nobler
breast
of
his
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
As
the
indomitable
cock
preparing
for
the
combat
sharpens
his
spurs
,
shakes
his
feathers
,
and
erects
his
comb
,
so
did
the
archdeacon
arrange
his
weapons
for
the
coming
war
,
without
misgiving
and
without
fear
.
<EOS>
That
he
was
fully
confident
of
the
justice
of
his
cause
<EOS>
let
no
one
doubt
.
<EOS>
Many
a
man
can
fight
his
battle
with
good
courage
,
but
with
a
doubting
conscience
.
<EOS>
Such
was
not
the
case
with
Dr
Grantly
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
believe
in
the
Gospel
with
more
assurance
than
he
did
in
the
sacred
justice
of
all
ecclesiastical
revenues
.
<EOS>
When
he
put
his
shoulder
to
the
wheel
to
defend
the
income
of
the
present
and
future
precentors
of
Barchester
,
he
was
animated
by
as
strong
a
sense
of
a
holy
cause
,
as
that
which
gives
courage
to
a
missionary
in
Africa
,
or
enables
a
sister
of
mercy
to
give
up
the
pleasures
of
the
world
for
the
wards
of
a
hospital
.
<EOS>
He
was
about
to
defend
the
holy
of
holies
from
the
touch
of
the
profane
;
to
guard
the
citadel
of
his
church
from
the
most
rampant
of
its
enemies
;
to
put
on
his
good
armour
in
the
best
of
fights
,
and
secure
,
if
possible
,
the
comforts
of
his
creed
for
coming
generations
of
ecclesiastical
dignitaries
.
<EOS>
Such
a
work
required
no
ordinary
vigour
;
and
the
archdeacon
was
,
therefore
,
extraordinarily
vigorous
.
<EOS>
It
demanded
a
buoyant
courage
,
and
a
heart
happy
in
its
toil
;
and
the
archdeacon
's
heart
was
happy
,
and
his
courage
was
buoyant
.
  
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
animate
his
father
-
in
-
law
with
feelings
like
his
own
,
but
this
did
not
much
disturb
him
.
<EOS>
He
preferred
to
bear
the
brunt
of
the
battle
alone
,
and
did
not
doubt
that
the
warden
would
resign
himself
into
his
hands
with
passive
submission
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr
Chadwick
,
"
he
said
,
walking
into
the
steward
's
office
a
day
or
two
after
the
signing
of
the
petition
as
commemorated
in
the
last
chapter
:
"
anything
from
Cox
and
Cummins
this
morning
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Chadwick
handed
him
a
letter
;
which
he
read
,
stroking
the
tight
-
gaitered
calf
of
his
right
leg
as
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
Messrs
Cox
and
Cummins
merely
said
that
they
had
as
yet
received
no
notice
from
their
adversaries
;
that
they
could
recommend
no
preliminary
steps
;
but
that
should
any
proceeding
really
be
taken
by
the
bedesmen
,
it
would
be
expedient
to
consult
that
very
eminent
Queen
's
Counsel
,
Sir
Abraham
Haphazard
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
quite
agree
with
them
,
"
said
Dr
Grantly
,
refolding
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
I
perfectly
agree
with
them
.
<EOS>
Haphazard
is
no
doubt
the
best
man
;
a
thorough
churchman
,
a
sound
conservative
,
and
in
every
respect
the
best
man
we
could
get
;
 
<EOS>
he
's
in
the
House
,
too
,
which
is
a
great
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Chadwick
quite
agreed
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
how
completely
he
put
down
that
scoundrel
Horseman
about
the
Bishop
of
Beverley
's
income
;
how
completely
he
set
them
all
adrift
in
the
earl
's
case
.
"
<EOS>
Since
the
question
of
St
Cross
had
been
mooted
by
the
public
,
one
noble
lord
had
become
"
the
earl
,
"
_
par
excellence
<EOS>
_
,
in
the
doctor
's
estimation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
he
silenced
that
fellow
at
Rochester
.
<EOS>
Of
course
we
must
have
Haphazard
;
and
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
Mr
Chadwick
,
we
must
take
care
to
be
in
time
,
or
the
other
party
will
forestall
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
all
his
admiration
for
Sir
Abraham
,
the
doctor
seemed
to
think
it
not
impossible
that
that
great
man
might
be
induced
to
lend
his
gigantic
powers
to
the
side
of
the
church
's
enemies
.
  
<EOS>
Having
settled
this
point
to
his
satisfaction
,
the
doctor
stepped
down
to
the
hospital
,
to
learn
how
matters
were
going
on
there
;
and
as
he
walked
across
the
hallowed
close
,
and
looked
up
at
the
ravens
who
cawed
with
a
peculiar
reverence
as
he
wended
his
way
,
he
thought
with
increased
acerbity
of
those
whose
impiety
would
venture
to
disturb
the
goodly
grace
of
cathedral
institutions
.
  
<EOS>
And
who
has
not
felt
the
same
?
<EOS>
We
believe
that
Mr
Horseman
himself
would
relent
,
and
the
spirit
of
Sir
Benjamin
Hall
give
way
,
were
those
great
reformers
to
allow
themselves
to
stroll
by
<EOS>
moonlight
round
the
towers
of
some
of
our
ancient
churches
.
<EOS>
Who
would
not
feel
charity
for
a
prebendary
when
walking
the
quiet
length
of
that
long
aisle
at
Winchester
,
looking
at
those
decent
houses
,
that
trim
grass
-
plat
,
and
feeling
,
as
one
must
,
<EOS>
the
solemn
,
orderly
comfort
of
the
spot
!
<EOS>
Who
could
be
hard
upon
a
dean
while
wandering
round
the
sweet
close
of
Hereford
,
and
owning
that
in
that
precinct
,
tone
and
colour
,
design
and
form
,
solemn
tower
and
storied
window
,
are
all
in
unison
,
and
all
perfect
!
<EOS>
Who
could
lie
basking
in
the
cloisters
of
Salisbury
,
and
gaze
on
Jewel
's
library
and
that
unequalled
spire
,
without
feeling
that
bishops
should
sometimes
be
rich
!
  
<EOS>
The
tone
of
our
archdeacon
's
mind
must
not
astonish
us
;
it
has
been
the
growth
of
centuries
of
church
ascendancy
;
and
though
some
fungi
now
disfigure
the
tree
,
though
there
be
much
dead
wood
,
for
how
much
good
fruit
have
not
we
to
be
thankful
?
<EOS>
Who
,
without
remorse
,
can
batter
down
the
dead
branches
of
an
old
oak
,
now
useless
,
but
,
ah
!
<EOS>
still
so
beautiful
,
or
drag
out
the
fragments
of
the
ancient
forest
,
without
feeling
that
they
sheltered
the
younger
plants
,
to
which
they
are
now
summoned
to
give
way
in
a
tone
so
peremptory
and
so
harsh
?
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
,
with
all
his
virtues
,
was
not
a
man
of
delicate
feeling
;
and
after
having
made
his
morning
salutations
in
the
warden
's
drawing
-
room
,
he
did
not
scruple
to
commence
an
attack
on
"
pestilent
"
John
Bold
in
the
presence
of
Miss
Harding
,
though
he
rightly
guessed
that
that
lady
was
not
indifferent
to
the
name
of
his
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nelly
,
my
dear
,
fetch
me
my
spectacles
from
the
back
room
,
"
said
her
father
,
anxious
to
save
both
her
blushes
and
her
feelings
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
brought
the
spectacles
,
while
her
father
was
trying
,
in
ambiguous
phrases
,
to
explain
to
her
too
-
practical
brother
-
in
-
law
that
it
might
be
as
well
not
to
say
anything
about
Bold
before
her
,
and
then
retreated
.
<EOS>
Nothing
had
been
explained
to
her
about
Bold
and
the
hospital
;
but
,
with
a
woman
's
instinct
she
knew
that
things
were
going
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
soon
be
doing
something
,
"
commenced
the
archdeacon
,
wiping
his
brows
with
a
large
,
bright
-
coloured
handkerchief
,
for
he
had
felt
busy
,
and
had
walked
quick
,
and
it
was
a
broiling
summer
's
day
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
have
heard
of
the
petition
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
owned
,
somewhat
unwillingly
,
that
he
had
heard
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
looked
for
some
expressions
of
opinion
,
but
none
coming
,
he
continued
,
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
be
doing
something
,
you
know
;
we
must
n't
allow
these
people
to
cut
the
ground
from
under
us
while
we
sit
looking
on
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
,
who
was
a
practical
man
,
allowed
himself
the
use
of
everyday
expressive
modes
of
speech
when
among
his
closest
intimates
,
though
no
one
could
soar
into
a
more
intricate
labyrinth
of
refined
phraseology
when
the
church
was
the
subject
,
and
his
lower
brethren
were
his
auditors
.
  
<EOS>
The
warden
still
looked
mutely
in
his
face
,
making
the
slightest
possible
passes
with
an
imaginary
fiddle
bow
,
and
stopping
,
as
he
did
so
,
sundry
imaginary
strings
with
the
fingers
of
his
other
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Twas
his
constant
consolation
in
conversational
troubles
.
<EOS>
While
these
vexed
him
sorely
,
the
passes
would
be
short
and
slow
,
and
the
upper
hand
would
not
be
seen
to
work
;
nay
,
the
strings
on
which
it
operated
would
sometimes
lie
concealed
in
the
musician
's
pocket
,
and
the
instrument
on
which
he
played
would
be
beneath
his
chair
;
 
but
as
his
spirit
warmed
to
the
subject
,
 
as
his
trusting
heart
looking
to
the
bottom
of
that
which
vexed
him
,
would
see
its
clear
way
out
,
 
he
would
rise
to
a
higher
melody
,
sweep
the
unseen
strings
with
a
bolder
hand
,
and
swiftly
fingering
the
cords
from
his
neck
,
down
along
his
waistcoat
,
and
up
again
to
his
very
ear
,
create
an
ecstatic
strain
of
perfect
music
,
audible
to
himself
and
to
St
Cecilia
,
and
not
without
effect
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
quite
agree
with
Cox
and
Cummins
,
"
continued
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
They
say
we
must
secure
Sir
Abraham
Haphazard
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
have
the
slightest
fear
in
leaving
the
case
in
Sir
Abraham
's
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
warden
played
the
slowest
and
saddest
of
tunes
.
<EOS>
It
was
but
a
dirge
on
one
string
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
Sir
Abraham
will
not
be
long
in
letting
Master
Bold
know
what
he
's
about
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
hear
Sir
Abraham
cross
-
questioning
him
at
the
Common
Pleas
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
warden
thought
of
his
income
being
thus
discussed
,
his
modest
life
,
his
daily
habits
,
and
his
easy
work
;
and
nothing
issued
from
that
single
cord
,
but
a
low
wail
of
sorrow
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
've
sent
this
petition
up
to
my
father
.
<EOS>
"
The
warden
did
n't
know
;
he
imagined
they
would
do
so
this
very
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
ca
n't
understand
is
,
how
you
let
them
do
it
,
with
such
a
command
as
you
have
in
the
place
,
or
should
have
with
such
a
man
as
Bunce
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
understand
why
you
let
them
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
what
?
"
asked
the
warden
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
listen
to
this
fellow
Bold
,
and
that
other
low
pettifogger
,
Finney
;
 
and
get
up
this
petition
too
.
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
you
tell
Bunce
to
destroy
the
petition
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
would
have
been
hardly
wise
,
"
said
the
warden
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wise
;
 
yes
,
it
would
have
been
very
wise
if
they
'd
done
it
among
themselves
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
up
to
the
palace
and
answer
it
now
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
very
short
answer
they
'll
get
,
I
can
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
should
n't
they
petition
,
doctor
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
n't
they
!
"
responded
the
archdeacon
,
in
a
loud
brazen
voice
,
as
though
all
the
men
in
the
hospital
were
expected
to
hear
him
through
the
walls
;
"
why
should
n't
they
?
<EOS>
I
'll
let
them
know
why
they
should
n't
;
by
the
bye
,
warden
,
I
'd
like
to
say
a
few
words
to
them
all
together
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
warden
's
mind
misgave
him
,
and
even
for
a
moment
he
forgot
to
play
.
<EOS>
He
by
no
means
wished
to
delegate
to
his
son
-
in
-
law
his
place
and
authority
of
warden
;
he
had
expressly
determined
not
to
interfere
in
any
step
which
the
men
might
wish
to
take
in
the
matter
under
dispute
;
he
was
most
anxious
neither
to
accuse
them
nor
to
defend
himself
.
<EOS>
All
these
things
he
was
aware
the
archdeacon
would
do
in
his
behalf
,
and
that
not
in
the
mildest
manner
;
and
yet
he
knew
not
how
to
refuse
the
permission
requested
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
so
much
sooner
remain
quiet
in
the
matter
,
"
said
he
,
in
an
apologetic
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quiet
!
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
still
speaking
with
his
brazen
trumpet
;
"
do
you
wish
to
be
ruined
in
quiet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
if
I
am
to
be
ruined
,
certainly
.
"
  
"
Nonsense
,
warden
;
I
tell
you
something
must
be
done
;
 
we
must
act
;
just
let
me
ring
the
bell
,
and
send
the
men
word
that
I
'll
speak
to
them
in
the
quad
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
knew
not
how
to
resist
,
and
the
disagreeable
order
was
given
.
<EOS>
The
quad
,
as
it
was
familiarly
called
,
was
a
small
quadrangle
,
open
on
one
side
to
the
river
,
and
surrounded
on
the
others
by
the
high
wall
of
Mr
Harding
's
garden
,
by
one
gable
end
of
Mr
Harding
's
house
,
and
by
the
end
of
the
row
of
buildings
which
formed
the
residences
of
the
bedesmen
.
<EOS>
It
was
flagged
all
round
,
and
the
centre
was
stoned
;
small
stone
gutters
ran
from
the
four
corners
of
the
square
to
a
grating
in
the
centre
;
and
attached
to
the
end
of
Mr
Harding
's
house
was
a
conduit
with
four
cocks
covered
over
from
the
weather
,
at
which
the
old
men
got
their
water
,
and
very
generally
performed
their
morning
toilet
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
quiet
,
sombre
place
,
shaded
over
by
the
trees
of
the
warden
's
garden
.
<EOS>
On
the
side
towards
the
river
,
there
stood
a
row
of
stone
seats
,
on
which
the
old
men
would
sit
and
gaze
at
the
little
fish
,
as
they
flitted
by
in
the
running
stream
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
side
of
the
river
was
a
rich
,
green
meadow
,
running
up
to
and
joining
the
deanery
,
and
as
little
open
to
the
public
as
the
garden
of
the
dean
itself
.
<EOS>
Nothing
,
therefore
,
could
be
more
private
than
the
quad
of
the
hospital
;
and
it
was
there
that
the
archdeacon
determined
to
convey
to
them
his
sense
of
their
refractory
proceedings
.
  
<EOS>
The
servant
soon
brought
in
word
that
the
men
were
assembled
in
the
quad
,
and
the
archdeacon
,
big
with
his
purpose
,
rose
to
address
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
warden
,
of
course
you
're
coming
,
"
said
he
,
seeing
that
Mr
Harding
did
not
prepare
to
follow
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
'd
excuse
me
,
"
said
Mr
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
heaven
's
sake
,
do
n't
let
us
have
division
in
the
camp
,
"
replied
the
archdeacon
:
"
let
us
have
a
long
pull
and
a
strong
pull
,
but
above
all
a
pull
all
together
;
come
,
warden
,
come
;
do
n't
be
afraid
of
your
duty
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
was
afraid
;
he
was
afraid
that
he
was
being
led
to
do
that
which
was
not
his
duty
;
he
was
not
,
however
,
strong
enough
to
resist
,
so
he
got
up
and
followed
his
son
-
in
-
law
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
men
were
assembled
in
groups
in
the
quadrangle
 
eleven
of
them
at
least
,
for
poor
old
Johnny
Bell
was
bed
-
ridden
,
and
could
n't
come
;
he
had
,
however
,
put
his
mark
to
the
petition
,
as
one
of
Handy
's
earliest
followers
.
'
<EOS>
tis
true
he
could
not
move
from
the
bed
where
he
lay
;
'
tis
true
<EOS>
he
had
no
friend
on
earth
,
but
<EOS>
those
whom
the
hospital
contained
;
and
of
those
the
warden
and
his
daughter
were
the
most
constant
and
most
appreciated
;
'
tis
true
that
everything
was
administered
to
him
which
his
failing
body
could
require
,
or
which
his
faint
appetite
could
enjoy
;
but
still
his
dull
eye
had
glistened
for
a
moment
at
the
idea
of
possessing
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
"
to
his
own
cheek
,
"
as
Abel
Handy
had
eloquently
expressed
it
;
and
poor
old
Johnny
Bell
had
greedily
put
his
mark
to
the
petition
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
two
clergymen
appeared
,
they
all
uncovered
their
heads
.
<EOS>
Handy
was
slow
to
do
it
,
and
hesitated
;
but
the
black
coat
and
waistcoat
of
which
he
had
spoken
so
irreverently
in
Skulpit
's
room
,
had
its
effect
even
on
him
,
and
he
too
doffed
his
hat
.
<EOS>
Bunce
,
advancing
before
the
others
,
bowed
lowly
to
the
archdeacon
,
and
with
affectionate
reverence
expressed
his
wish
,
that
the
warden
and
Miss
Eleanor
were
quite
well
;
"
and
the
doctor
's
lady
,
"
he
added
,
turning
to
the
archdeacon
,
"
and
the
children
at
Plumstead
,
and
my
lord
;
"
and
having
made
his
speech
,
he
also
retired
among
the
others
,
and
took
his
place
with
the
rest
upon
the
stone
benches
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
archdeacon
stood
up
to
make
his
speech
,
erect
in
the
middle
of
that
little
square
<EOS>
,
he
looked
like
an
ecclesiastical
statue
placed
there
,
as
a
fitting
impersonation
of
the
church
militant
here
on
earth
;
his
shovel
hat
,
large
,
new
,
and
well
-
pronounced
,
a
churchman
's
hat
in
every
inch
,
declared
the
profession
as
plainly
as
does
the
Quaker
's
broad
brim
;
his
heavy
eyebrows
,
large
open
eyes
,
and
full
mouth
and
chin
expressed
the
solidity
of
his
order
;
the
broad
chest
,
amply
covered
with
fine
cloth
,
told
how
well
to
do
was
its
estate
;
one
hand
ensconced
within
his
pocket
,
evinced
the
practical
hold
which
our
mother
church
keeps
on
her
temporal
possessions
;
and
the
other
,
loose
for
action
,
was
ready
to
fight
if
need
be
in
her
defence
;
and
,
below
these
,
the
decorous
breeches
,
and
neat
black
gaiters
showing
so
admirably
that
well
-
turned
leg
,
betokened
the
decency
,
the
outward
beauty
and
grace
of
our
church
establishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
men
,
"
he
began
,
when
he
had
settled
himself
well
in
his
position
,
"
I
want
to
say
a
few
words
to
you
.
<EOS>
Your
good
friend
,
the
warden
here
,
and
myself
,
and
my
lord
the
bishop
,
on
whose
behalf
I
wish
to
speak
to
you
,
would
all
be
very
sorry
,
very
sorry
indeed
,
that
you
should
have
any
just
ground
of
complaint
.
<EOS>
Any
just
ground
of
complaint
on
your
part
would
be
removed
at
once
by
the
warden
,
or
by
his
lordship
,
or
by
me
on
his
behalf
,
without
the
necessity
of
any
petition
on
your
part
.
"
<EOS>
Here
the
orator
stopped
for
a
moment
,
expecting
that
some
little
murmurs
of
applause
would
show
that
the
weakest
of
the
men
were
beginning
to
give
way
;
but
no
such
murmurs
came
.
<EOS>
Bunce
,
himself
,
even
sat
with
closed
lips
,
mute
and
unsatisfactory
.
<EOS>
"
Without
the
necessity
of
any
petition
at
all
,
"
he
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
told
you
have
addressed
a
petition
to
my
lord
.
"
<EOS>
He
paused
for
a
reply
from
the
men
,
and
after
a
while
,
Handy
plucked
up
courage
and
said
,
"
Yes
,
we
has
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
addressed
a
petition
to
my
lord
,
in
which
,
as
I
am
informed
,
you
express
an
opinion
that
you
do
not
receive
from
Hiram
's
estate
all
that
is
your
due
.
<EOS>
"
Here
most
of
the
men
expressed
their
assent
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
what
is
it
you
ask
for
?
<EOS>
What
is
it
you
want
that
you
hav'n"t
got
here
?
<EOS>
What
is
it
 
"
  
"
A
hundred
a
year
,
"
muttered
old
Moody
,
with
a
voice
as
if
it
came
out
of
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
hundred
a
year
!
"
ejaculated
the
archdeacon
militant
,
defying
the
impudence
of
these
claimants
with
one
hand
<EOS>
stretched
out
and
closed
,
while
with
the
other
he
tightly
grasped
,
and
secured
within
his
breeches
pocket
,
that
symbol
of
the
church
's
wealth
which
his
own
loose
half
-
crowns
not
unaptly
represented
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
hundred
a
year
!
<EOS>
Why
,
my
men
,
you
must
be
mad
;
and
you
talk
about
John
Hiram
's
will
!
<EOS>
When
John
Hiram
built
a
hospital
for
worn
-
out
old
men
,
worn
-
out
old
labouring
men
,
infirm
old
men
past
their
work
,
cripples
,
blind
,
bed
-
ridden
,
and
such
like
<EOS>
,
do
you
think
he
meant
to
make
gentlemen
of
them
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
John
Hiram
intended
to
give
a
hundred
a
year
to
old
single
men
,
who
earned
perhaps
two
shillings
or
half
-
a
-
crown
a
day
for
themselves
and
families
in
the
best
of
their
time
?
<EOS>
No
,
my
men
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
John
Hiram
meant
:
he
meant
that
twelve
poor
old
worn
-
out
labourers
,
men
who
could
no
longer
support
themselves
,
who
had
no
friends
to
support
them
,
who
must
starve
and
perish
miserably
if
not
protected
by
the
hand
of
charity
;
 
he
meant
that
twelve
such
men
as
these
should
come
in
here
in
their
poverty
and
wretchedness
,
and
find
within
these
walls
shelter
and
food
before
their
death
,
and
a
little
leisure
to
make
their
peace
with
God
.
<EOS>
That
was
what
John
Hiram
meant
:
you
have
not
read
John
Hiram
's
will
,
and
I
doubt
whether
those
wicked
men
who
are
advising
you
have
done
so
.
<EOS>
I
have
;
I
know
what
his
will
was
;
and
I
tell
you
that
that
was
his
will
,
and
that
that
was
his
intention
.
<EOS>
"
  
Not
a
sound
came
from
the
eleven
bedesmen
,
as
they
sat
listening
to
what
,
according
to
the
archdeacon
,
was
their
intended
estate
.
<EOS>
They
grimly
stared
upon
his
burly
figure
,
but
did
not
then
express
,
by
word
or
sign
,
the
anger
and
disgust
to
which
such
language
was
sure
to
give
rise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
let
me
ask
you
,
"
he
continued
:
"
<EOS>
do
you
think
you
are
worse
off
than
John
Hiram
intended
to
make
you
?
<EOS>
Have
you
not
shelter
,
and
food
,
and
leisure
?
<EOS>
Have
you
not
much
more
?
<EOS>
Have
you
not
every
indulgence
which
you
are
capable
of
enjoying
?
<EOS>
Have
you
not
twice
better
food
,
twice
a
better
bed
,
ten
times
more
money
in
your
pocket
than
you
were
ever
able
to
earn
for
yourselves
before
you
were
lucky
enough
to
get
into
this
place
?
<EOS>
And
now
you
send
a
petition
to
the
bishop
,
asking
for
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
!
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
,
my
friends
;
you
are
deluded
,
and
made
fools
of
by
wicked
men
who
are
acting
for
their
own
ends
.
<EOS>
You
will
never
get
a
hundred
pence
a
year
more
than
what
you
have
now
:
it
is
very
possible
that
you
may
get
less
;
it
is
very
possible
that
my
lord
the
bishop
,
and
your
warden
,
may
make
changes
 
"
  
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
interrupted
Mr
Harding
,
who
had
been
listening
with
indescribable
misery
to
the
tirade
of
his
son
-
in
-
law
;
"
no
,
my
friends
.
<EOS>
I
want
no
changes
,
 
at
least
no
changes
that
shall
make
you
worse
off
than
you
now
are
,
as
long
as
you
and
I
live
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
Mr
Harding
,
"
said
Bunce
;
and
"
God
bless
you
,
Mr
Harding
,
God
bless
you
,
sir
:
<EOS>
we
know
you
was
always
our
friend
,
"
was
exclaimed
by
enough
of
the
men
to
make
it
appear
that
the
sentiment
was
general
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
had
been
interrupted
in
his
speech
before
he
had
quite
finished
it
;
but
he
felt
that
he
could
not
recommence
with
dignity
after
this
little
ebullition
,
and
he
led
the
way
back
into
the
garden
,
followed
by
his
father
-
in
-
law
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
he
,
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
within
the
cool
retreat
of
the
warden
's
garden
;
"
I
think
I
spoke
to
them
plainly
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
;
for
making
a
speech
under
a
broiling
mid
-
day
sun
in
summer
,
in
a
full
suit
of
thick
black
cloth
,
is
warm
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
were
plain
enough
,
"
replied
the
warden
,
in
a
tone
which
did
not
express
approbation
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
's
everything
,
"
said
the
other
,
who
was
clearly
well
satisfied
with
himself
;
"
that
's
everything
:
with
those
sort
of
people
one
must
be
plain
,
or
one
will
not
be
understood
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
think
they
did
understand
me
;
 
I
think
they
knew
what
I
meant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
warden
agreed
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
thought
they
had
understood
to
the
full
what
had
been
said
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
know
pretty
well
what
they
have
to
expect
from
us
;
they
know
how
we
shall
meet
any
refractory
spirit
on
their
part
;
they
know
that
we
are
not
afraid
of
them
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
'll
just
step
into
Chadwick
's
,
and
tell
him
what
I
've
done
;
and
then
I
'll
go
up
to
the
palace
,
and
answer
this
petition
of
theirs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
warden
's
mind
was
very
full
,
 
full
nearly
to
overcharging
itself
;
and
had
it
done
so
,
 
had
he
allowed
himself
to
speak
the
thoughts
which
were
working
within
him
,
he
would
indeed
have
astonished
the
archdeacon
by
the
reprobation
he
would
have
expressed
as
to
the
proceeding
of
which
he
had
been
so
unwilling
a
witness
.
<EOS>
But
different
feelings
kept
him
silent
;
he
was
as
yet
afraid
of
differing
from
his
son
-
in
-
law
;
 
he
was
anxious
beyond
measure
to
avoid
even
a
semblance
of
rupture
with
any
of
his
order
,
and
was
painfully
fearful
of
having
to
come
to
an
open
quarrel
with
any
person
on
any
subject
.
<EOS>
His
life
had
hitherto
been
so
quiet
,
so
free
from
strife
;
his
little
early
troubles
had
required
nothing
but
passive
fortitude
;
his
subsequent
prosperity
had
never
forced
upon
him
any
active
cares
,
 
had
never
brought
him
into
disagreeable
contact
with
anyone
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
he
would
give
almost
anything
,
 
much
more
than
he
knew
he
ought
to
do
,
 
to
relieve
himself
from
the
storm
which
he
feared
was
coming
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
hard
that
the
pleasant
waters
of
his
little
stream
should
be
disturbed
and
muddied
by
rough
hands
;
that
his
quiet
paths
should
be
made
a
battlefield
;
that
the
unobtrusive
corner
of
the
world
which
had
been
allotted
to
him
,
as
though
by
Providence
,
should
be
invaded
and
desecrated
,
and
all
within
it
made
miserable
and
unsound
.
  
<EOS>
Money
he
had
none
to
give
;
the
knack
of
putting
guineas
together
had
never
belonged
to
him
;
but
how
willingly
,
with
what
a
foolish
easiness
,
with
what
happy
alacrity
,
would
he
have
abandoned
the
half
of
his
income
for
all
time
to
come
,
<EOS>
could
he
by
so
doing
<EOS>
have
quietly
dispelled
the
clouds
that
were
gathering
over
him
,
 
could
he
have
thus
compromised
the
matter
between
the
reformer
and
the
conservative
,
between
his
possible
son
-
in
-
law
,
Bold
,
and
his
positive
son
-
in
-
law
,
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
And
this
compromise
would
not
have
been
made
from
any
prudential
motive
of
saving
what
would
yet
remain
,
for
Mr
Harding
still
felt
little
doubt
but
he
should
be
left
for
life
in
quiet
possession
of
the
good
things
he
had
,
if
he
chose
to
retain
them
.
<EOS>
No
;
he
would
have
done
so
from
the
sheer
love
of
quiet
,
and
from
a
horror
of
being
made
the
subject
of
public
talk
.
<EOS>
He
had
very
often
been
moved
to
pity
.
 
<EOS>
to
that
inward
weeping
of
the
heart
for
others
'
woes
;
<EOS>
but
none
had
he
ever
pitied
more
than
that
old
lord
,
whose
almost
fabulous
wealth
,
drawn
from
his
church
preferments
,
had
become
the
subject
of
so
much
opprobrium
,
of
such
public
scorn
;
that
wretched
clerical
octogenarian
Croesus
,
whom
men
would
not
allow
to
die
in
peace
,
 
whom
all
the
world
united
to
decry
and
to
abhor
.
  
<EOS>
Was
he
to
suffer
such
a
fate
?
<EOS>
Was
his
humble
name
to
be
bandied
in
men
's
mouths
,
as
the
gormandiser
of
the
resources
of
the
poor
,
as
of
one
who
had
filched
from
the
charity
of
other
ages
wealth
which
had
been
intended
to
relieve
the
old
and
the
infirm
?
<EOS>
Was
he
to
be
gibbeted
in
the
press
,
to
become
a
byword
for
oppression
,
to
be
named
as
an
example
of
the
greed
of
the
English
church
?
<EOS>
Should
it
ever
be
said
that
he
had
robbed
those
old
men
,
whom
he
so
truly
and
so
tenderly
loved
in
his
heart
of
hearts
?
<EOS>
As
he
slowly
paced
,
hour
after
hour
,
under
those
noble
lime
-
trees
,
turning
these
sad
thoughts
within
him
,
he
became
all
but
fixed
in
his
resolve
that
some
great
step
must
be
taken
to
relieve
him
from
the
risk
of
so
terrible
a
fate
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
,
the
archdeacon
,
with
contented
mind
and
unruffled
spirit
,
went
about
his
business
.
<EOS>
He
said
a
word
or
two
to
Mr
Chadwick
,
and
then
finding
,
as
he
expected
,
the
petition
lying
in
his
father
's
library
,
he
wrote
a
short
answer
to
the
men
,
in
which
he
told
them
that
they
had
no
evils
to
redress
,
but
rather
great
mercies
for
which
to
be
thankful
;
and
having
seen
the
bishop
sign
it
,
he
got
into
his
brougham
and
returned
home
to
Mrs
Grantly
,
and
Plumstead
Episcopi
.
   
<EOS>
THE
WARDEN
'S
<EOS>
TEA
PARTY
 
<EOS>
After
much
painful
doubting
,
on
one
thing
only
could
Mr
Harding
resolve
.
<EOS>
He
determined
that
at
any
rate
he
would
take
no
offence
,
and
that
he
would
make
this
question
no
cause
of
quarrel
either
with
Bold
or
with
the
bedesmen
.
<EOS>
In
furtherance
of
this
resolution
,
he
himself
wrote
a
note
to
Mr
Bold
,
the
same
afternoon
,
inviting
him
to
meet
a
few
friends
and
hear
some
music
on
an
evening
named
in
the
next
week
.
<EOS>
Had
not
this
little
party
been
promised
to
Eleanor
,
in
his
present
state
of
mind
he
would
probably
have
avoided
such
gaiety
;
but
the
promise
had
been
given
,
the
invitations
were
to
be
written
,
and
when
Eleanor
consulted
her
father
on
the
subject
,
she
was
not
ill
pleased
to
hear
him
say
,
"
Oh
,
I
was
thinking
of
Bold
,
so
I
took
it
into
my
head
to
write
to
him
myself
,
but
you
must
write
to
his
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
Bold
was
older
than
her
brother
,
and
,
at
the
time
of
our
story
,
was
just
over
thirty
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
an
unattractive
young
woman
,
though
by
no
means
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Her
great
merit
was
the
kindliness
of
her
disposition
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
very
clever
,
nor
very
animated
,
nor
had
she
apparently
the
energy
of
her
brother
;
but
she
was
guided
by
a
high
principle
of
right
and
wrong
;
her
temper
was
sweet
,
and
her
faults
were
fewer
in
number
than
her
virtues
.
<EOS>
Those
who
casually
met
Mary
Bold
thought
little
of
her
;
but
those
who
knew
her
well
loved
her
well
,
and
the
longer
they
knew
her
the
more
they
loved
her
.
<EOS>
Among
those
who
were
fondest
of
her
was
Eleanor
Harding
;
and
though
Eleanor
had
never
openly
talked
to
her
of
her
brother
,
each
understood
the
other
's
feelings
about
him
.
<EOS>
The
brother
and
sister
were
sitting
together
when
the
two
notes
were
brought
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
odd
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
that
they
should
send
two
notes
.
<EOS>
Well
,
if
Mr
Harding
becomes
fashionable
,
the
world
is
going
to
change
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
brother
understood
immediately
the
nature
and
intention
of
the
peace
-
offering
;
but
it
was
not
so
easy
for
him
to
behave
well
in
the
matter
,
as
it
was
for
Mr
Harding
.
<EOS>
It
is
much
less
difficult
for
the
sufferer
to
be
generous
than
for
the
oppressor
.
<EOS>
John
Bold
felt
that
he
could
not
go
to
the
warden
's
party
:
he
never
loved
Eleanor
better
than
he
did
now
;
he
had
never
so
strongly
felt
how
anxious
he
was
to
make
her
his
wife
as
now
,
when
so
many
obstacles
to
his
doing
so
appeared
in
view
.
<EOS>
Yet
here
was
her
father
himself
,
as
it
were
,
clearing
away
those
very
obstacles
,
and
still
he
felt
that
he
could
not
go
to
the
house
any
more
as
an
open
friend
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
sat
thinking
of
these
things
with
the
note
in
his
hand
,
his
sister
was
waiting
for
his
decision
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
she
,
"
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
must
write
separate
answers
,
and
both
say
we
shall
be
very
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
go
,
of
course
,
Mary
,
"
said
he
;
to
which
she
readily
assented
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
,
"
he
continued
,
looking
serious
and
gloomy
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
,
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
why
not
,
John
?
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
She
had
as
yet
heard
nothing
of
the
new
-
found
abuse
which
her
brother
was
about
to
reform
;
 
at
least
nothing
which
connected
it
with
her
brother
's
name
.
  
<EOS>
He
sat
thinking
for
a
while
till
he
determined
that
it
would
be
best
to
tell
her
at
once
what
it
was
that
he
was
about
<EOS>
:
it
must
be
done
sooner
or
later
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
can
not
go
to
Mr
Harding
's
house
any
more
as
a
friend
,
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
John
!
<EOS>
Why
not
?
<EOS>
Ah
,
you
've
quarrelled
with
Eleanor
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
"
said
he
;
"
I
've
no
quarrel
with
her
as
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
,
John
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
looking
at
him
with
an
anxious
,
loving
face
,
<EOS>
for
she
knew
well
how
much
of
his
heart
was
there
in
that
house
which
he
said
he
could
no
longer
enter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
said
he
at
last
,
"
I
've
taken
up
the
case
of
these
twelve
old
men
of
Hiram
's
Hospital
,
and
of
course
that
brings
me
into
contact
with
Mr
Harding
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
to
oppose
him
,
interfere
with
him
,
 
perhaps
injure
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
looked
at
him
steadily
for
some
time
before
she
committed
herself
to
reply
,
and
then
merely
asked
him
what
he
meant
to
do
for
the
old
men
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
's
a
long
story
,
and
I
do
n't
know
that
I
can
make
you
understand
it
.
<EOS>
John
Hiram
made
a
will
,
and
left
his
property
in
charity
for
certain
poor
old
men
,
and
the
proceeds
,
instead
of
going
to
the
benefit
of
these
men
,
go
chiefly
into
the
pocket
of
the
warden
and
the
bishop
's
steward
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
mean
to
take
away
from
Mr
Harding
his
share
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
I
mean
yet
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
inquire
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
see
who
is
entitled
to
this
property
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
see
,
if
I
can
,
that
justice
be
done
to
the
poor
of
the
city
of
Barchester
generally
,
who
are
,
in
fact
,
the
legatees
under
the
will
.
<EOS>
I
mean
,
in
short
,
to
put
the
matter
right
,
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
why
are
you
to
do
this
,
John
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
ask
the
same
question
of
anybody
else
,
"
said
he
;
"
and
according
to
that
the
duty
of
righting
these
poor
men
would
belong
to
nobody
.
<EOS>
If
we
are
to
act
on
that
principle
,
the
weak
are
never
to
be
protected
,
injustice
is
never
to
be
opposed
,
and
no
one
is
to
struggle
for
the
poor
!
"
<EOS>
And
Bold
began
to
comfort
himself
in
the
warmth
of
his
own
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
is
there
no
one
to
do
this
<EOS>
but
you
,
who
have
known
Mr
Harding
so
long
?
<EOS>
Surely
,
John
,
as
a
friend
,
as
a
young
friend
,
so
much
younger
than
Mr
Harding
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
's
woman
's
logic
,
all
over
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
What
has
age
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
Another
man
might
plead
that
he
was
too
old
;
and
as
to
his
friendship
,
if
the
thing
itself
be
right
,
private
motives
should
never
be
allowed
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
Because
I
esteem
Mr
Harding
,
is
that
a
reason
that
I
should
neglect
a
duty
which
I
owe
to
these
old
men
?
<EOS>
or
should
I
give
up
a
work
which
my
conscience
tells
me
<EOS>
is
a
good
one
,
because
I
regret
the
loss
of
his
society
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
Eleanor
,
John
?
"
said
the
sister
,
looking
timidly
into
her
brother
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
,
that
is
,
Miss
Harding
,
if
she
thinks
fit
,
 
that
is
,
if
her
father
 
<EOS>
or
,
rather
,
if
she
 
or
,
indeed
,
he
,
 
if
they
find
it
necessary
 
<EOS>
but
there
is
no
necessity
now
to
talk
about
Eleanor
Harding
;
but
this
I
will
say
,
that
if
she
has
the
kind
of
spirit
for
which
I
give
her
credit
,
she
will
not
condemn
me
for
doing
what
I
think
to
be
a
duty
.
"
<EOS>
And
Bold
consoled
himself
with
the
consolation
of
a
Roman
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
sat
silent
for
a
while
,
till
at
last
her
brother
reminded
her
that
the
notes
must
be
answered
,
and
she
got
up
,
and
placed
her
desk
before
her
,
took
out
her
pen
and
paper
,
wrote
on
it
slowly
:
  
<EOS>
PAKENHAM
VILLAS
Tuesday
morning
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
ELEANOR
,
  
<EOS>
I
    
and
then
stopped
,
and
looked
at
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mary
,
why
do
n't
you
write
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
John
,
"
said
she
,
"
<EOS>
dear
John
,
pray
think
better
of
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Think
better
of
what
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
this
about
the
hospital
,
 
of
all
this
about
Mr
Harding
,
 
of
what
you
say
about
those
old
men
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
call
upon
you
,
 
no
duty
can
require
you
to
set
yourself
against
your
oldest
,
your
best
friend
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
John
,
think
of
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
You
'll
break
her
heart
,
and
your
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nonsense
,
Mary
;
Miss
Harding
's
heart
is
as
safe
as
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Pray
,
pray
,
for
my
sake
,
John
,
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
dearly
you
love
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
came
and
knelt
before
him
on
the
rug
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pray
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
You
are
going
to
make
yourself
,
and
her
,
and
her
father
miserable
<EOS>
:
you
are
going
to
make
us
all
miserable
.
<EOS>
And
for
what
?
<EOS>
For
a
dream
of
justice
.
<EOS>
You
will
never
make
those
twelve
men
happier
than
they
now
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
understand
it
,
my
dear
girl
,
"
said
he
,
smoothing
her
hair
with
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
understand
it
,
John
.
<EOS>
I
understand
that
this
is
a
chimera
,
 
a
dream
that
you
have
got
.
<EOS>
I
know
well
that
no
duty
can
require
you
to
do
this
mad
 
this
suicidal
thing
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
love
Eleanor
Harding
with
all
your
heart
,
and
I
tell
you
now
that
she
loves
you
as
well
.
<EOS>
If
there
was
a
plain
,
a
positive
duty
before
you
,
I
would
be
the
last
to
bid
you
neglect
it
for
any
woman
's
love
;
but
this
 
;
oh
,
think
again
,
before
you
do
anything
to
make
it
necessary
that
you
and
Mr
Harding
should
be
at
variance
.
"
<EOS>
He
did
not
answer
,
as
she
knelt
there
,
leaning
on
his
knees
,
but
by
his
face
she
thought
that
he
was
inclined
to
yield
.
"
<EOS>
At
any
rate
let
me
say
that
you
will
go
to
this
party
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
do
not
break
with
them
while
your
mind
is
in
doubt
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
got
up
,
hoping
to
conclude
her
note
in
the
way
she
desired
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
mind
is
not
in
doubt
,
"
at
last
he
said
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
never
respect
myself
again
were
I
to
give
way
now
,
because
Eleanor
Harding
is
beautiful
.
<EOS>
I
do
love
her
:
I
would
give
a
hand
to
hear
her
tell
me
what
you
have
said
,
speaking
on
her
behalf
;
but
<EOS>
I
can
not
for
her
sake
go
back
from
the
task
which
I
have
commenced
.
<EOS>
I
hope
she
may
hereafter
acknowledge
and
respect
my
motives
,
but
I
can
not
now
go
as
a
guest
to
her
father
's
house
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
Barchester
Brutus
went
out
to
fortify
his
own
resolution
by
meditations
on
his
own
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mary
Bold
sat
down
,
and
sadly
finished
her
note
,
saying
that
she
would
herself
attend
the
party
,
but
that
her
brother
was
unavoidably
prevented
from
doing
so
.
<EOS>
I
fear
that
she
did
not
admire
as
she
should
have
done
the
self
-
devotion
of
his
singular
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
The
party
went
off
as
such
parties
do
.
<EOS>
There
were
fat
old
ladies
,
in
fine
silk
dresses
,
and
slim
young
ladies
,
in
gauzy
muslin
frocks
;
old
gentlemen
stood
up
with
their
backs
to
the
empty
fire
-
place
,
looking
by
no
means
so
comfortable
as
they
would
have
done
in
their
own
arm
-
chairs
at
home
;
and
young
gentlemen
,
rather
stiff
about
the
neck
,
clustered
near
the
door
,
not
as
yet
sufficiently
in
courage
to
attack
the
muslin
frocks
,
who
awaited
the
battle
,
drawn
up
in
a
semicircular
array
.
<EOS>
The
warden
endeavoured
to
induce
a
charge
,
but
failed
signally
,
not
having
the
tact
of
a
general
;
his
daughter
did
what
she
could
to
comfort
the
forces
under
her
command
,
who
took
in
refreshing
rations
of
cake
and
tea
,
and
patiently
looked
for
the
coming
engagement
:
but
she
herself
,
Eleanor
,
had
no
spirit
for
the
work
;
the
only
enemy
whose
lance
she
cared
to
encounter
was
not
there
,
and
she
and
others
were
somewhat
dull
.
  
<EOS>
Loud
above
all
voices
was
heard
the
clear
sonorous
tones
of
the
archdeacon
as
he
dilated
to
brother
parsons
of
the
danger
of
the
church
,
of
the
fearful
rumours
of
mad
reforms
even
at
Oxford
,
and
of
the
damnable
heresies
of
Dr
Whiston
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
,
however
,
sweeter
sounds
began
timidly
to
make
themselves
audible
.
<EOS>
Little
movements
were
made
in
a
quarter
notable
for
round
stools
and
music
stands
.
<EOS>
Wax
candles
were
arranged
in
sconces
,
big
books
were
brought
from
hidden
recesses
,
and
the
work
of
the
evening
commenced
.
  
<EOS>
How
often
were
those
pegs
twisted
and
re
-
twisted
before
our
friend
found
that
he
had
twisted
them
enough
;
how
many
discordant
scrapes
gave
promise
of
the
coming
harmony
.
<EOS>
How
much
the
muslin
fluttered
and
crumpled
before
Eleanor
and
another
nymph
were
duly
seated
at
the
piano
;
how
closely
did
that
tall
Apollo
pack
himself
against
the
wall
,
with
his
flute
,
long
as
himself
,
extending
high
over
the
heads
of
his
pretty
neighbours
;
into
how
small
a
corner
crept
that
round
and
florid
little
minor
canon
,
and
there
with
skill
amazing
found
room
to
tune
his
accustomed
fiddle
!
  
<EOS>
And
now
the
crash
begins
:
away
they
go
in
full
flow
of
harmony
together
,
 
up
hill
and
down
dale
,
 
now
louder
and
louder
,
then
lower
and
lower
;
now
loud
,
as
though
stirring
the
battle
;
then
low
,
as
though
mourning
the
slain
.
<EOS>
In
all
,
through
all
,
and
above
all
,
is
heard
the
violoncello
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
not
for
nothing
were
those
pegs
so
twisted
and
re
-
twisted
;
 
listen
,
listen
!
<EOS>
Now
alone
that
saddest
of
instruments
tells
its
touching
tale
.
<EOS>
Silent
,
and
in
awe
,
stand
fiddle
,
flute
,
and
piano
,
to
hear
the
sorrows
of
their
wailing
brother
.
'
<EOS>
tis
but
for
a
moment
:
before
the
melancholy
of
those
low
notes
has
been
fully
realised
,
again
comes
the
full
force
of
all
the
band
;
 
down
go
the
pedals
,
away
rush
twenty
fingers
scouring
over
the
bass
notes
with
all
the
impetus
of
passion
.
<EOS>
Apollo
blows
till
his
stiff
neckcloth
is
no
better
than
a
rope
,
and
the
minor
canon
works
with
both
arms
till
he
falls
in
a
syncope
of
exhaustion
against
the
wall
.
  
<EOS>
How
comes
it
that
now
,
when
all
should
be
silent
,
when
courtesy
,
if
not
taste
,
should
make
men
listen
,
 
<EOS>
how
is
it
at
this
moment
the
black
-
coated
corps
leave
their
retreat
and
begin
skirmishing
?
<EOS>
One
by
one
they
creep
forth
,
and
fire
off
little
guns
timidly
,
and
without
precision
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
my
men
,
efforts
such
as
these
will
take
no
cities
,
even
though
the
enemy
should
be
never
so
open
to
assault
.
<EOS>
At
length
a
more
deadly
artillery
is
brought
to
bear
;
slowly
,
but
with
effect
,
the
advance
is
made
;
the
muslin
ranks
are
broken
,
and
fall
into
confusion
;
the
formidable
array
of
chairs
gives
way
;
the
battle
is
no
longer
between
opposing
regiments
,
but
hand
to
hand
,
and
foot
to
foot
with
single
combatants
,
as
in
the
glorious
days
of
old
,
when
fighting
was
really
noble
.
<EOS>
In
corners
,
and
under
the
shadow
of
curtains
,
behind
sofas
and
half
hidden
by
doors
,
in
retiring
windows
,
and
sheltered
by
hanging
tapestry
,
are
blows
given
and
returned
,
fatal
,
incurable
,
dealing
death
.
  
<EOS>
Apart
from
this
another
combat
arises
,
more
sober
and
more
serious
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
is
engaged
against
two
prebendaries
,
a
pursy
full
-
blown
rector
assisting
him
,
in
all
the
perils
and
all
the
enjoyments
of
short
whist
.
<EOS>
With
solemn
energy
do
they
watch
the
shuffled
pack
,
and
,
all
-
expectant
,
eye
the
coming
trump
.
<EOS>
With
what
anxious
nicety
do
they
arrange
their
cards
,
jealous
of
each
other
's
eyes
!
<EOS>
Why
is
that
lean
doctor
so
slow
,
 
cadaverous
man
with
hollow
jaw
and
sunken
eye
,
<EOS>
ill
beseeming
the
richness
of
his
mother
church
!
<EOS>
Ah
,
why
so
slow
,
thou
meagre
doctor
?
<EOS>
See
how
the
archdeacon
,
speechless
in
his
agony
,
deposits
on
the
board
his
cards
,
and
looks
to
heaven
or
to
the
ceiling
for
support
.
<EOS>
Hark
,
how
he
sighs
,
as
with
thumbs
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
he
seems
to
signify
that
the
end
of
such
torment
is
not
yet
even
nigh
at
hand
!
<EOS>
Vain
is
the
hope
,
if
hope
there
be
,
to
disturb
that
meagre
doctor
.
<EOS>
With
care
precise
he
places
every
card
,
weighs
well
the
value
of
each
mighty
ace
,
each
guarded
king
,
and
comfort
-
giving
queen
;
speculates
on
knave
and
ten
,
counts
all
his
suits
,
and
sets
his
price
upon
the
whole
.
<EOS>
At
length
a
card
is
led
,
and
quick
three
others
fall
upon
the
board
.
<EOS>
The
little
doctor
leads
again
,
while
with
lustrous
eye
his
partner
absorbs
the
trick
.
<EOS>
Now
thrice
has
this
been
done
<EOS>
,
 
thrice
has
constant
fortune
favoured
the
brace
of
prebendaries
,
ere
the
archdeacon
rouses
himself
to
the
battle
;
but
at
the
fourth
assault
he
pins
to
the
earth
a
prostrate
king
,
laying
low
his
crown
and
sceptre
,
bushy
beard
,
and
lowering
brow
,
with
a
poor
deuce
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
David
did
Goliath
,
"
says
the
archdeacon
,
pushing
over
the
four
cards
to
his
partner
.
<EOS>
And
then
a
trump
is
led
,
then
another
trump
;
then
a
king
,
 
and
then
an
ace
,
 
and
then
a
long
ten
,
which
brings
down
from
the
meagre
doctor
his
only
remaining
tower
of
strength
 
his
cherished
queen
of
trumps
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
no
second
club
?
"
says
the
archdeacon
to
his
partner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
one
club
,
"
mutters
from
his
inmost
stomach
the
pursy
rector
,
who
sits
there
red
-
faced
,
silent
,
impervious
,
careful
,
a
safe
but
not
a
brilliant
ally
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
archdeacon
cares
not
for
many
clubs
,
or
for
none
.
<EOS>
He
dashes
out
his
remaining
cards
with
a
speed
most
annoying
to
his
antagonists
,
pushes
over
to
them
some
four
cards
as
their
allotted
portion
,
shoves
the
remainder
across
the
table
to
the
red
-
faced
rector
;
calls
out
"
two
by
cards
and
two
by
honours
,
and
the
odd
trick
last
time
,
"
marks
a
treble
under
the
candle
-
stick
,
and
has
dealt
round
the
second
pack
before
the
meagre
doctor
has
calculated
his
losses
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
went
off
the
warden
's
party
,
and
men
and
women
arranging
shawls
and
shoes
declared
how
pleasant
it
had
been
;
and
Mrs
Goodenough
,
the
red
-
faced
rector
's
wife
,
pressing
the
warden
's
hand
,
declared
she
had
never
enjoyed
herself
better
;
which
showed
how
little
pleasure
she
allowed
herself
in
this
world
,
as
she
had
sat
the
whole
evening
through
in
the
same
chair
without
occupation
,
not
speaking
,
and
unspoken
to
.
<EOS>
And
Matilda
Johnson
,
when
she
allowed
young
Dickson
of
the
bank
to
fasten
her
cloak
round
her
neck
<EOS>
,
thought
that
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
a
little
cottage
would
really
do
for
happiness
;
besides
,
he
was
sure
to
be
manager
some
day
.
<EOS>
And
Apollo
,
folding
his
flute
into
his
pocket
,
felt
that
he
had
acquitted
himself
with
honour
;
and
the
archdeacon
pleasantly
jingled
his
gains
;
but
the
meagre
doctor
went
off
without
much
audible
speech
,
muttering
ever
and
anon
as
he
went
,
"
three
and
thirty
points
!
"
<EOS>
"
three
and
thirty
points
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
they
all
were
gone
,
and
Mr
Harding
was
left
alone
with
his
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
What
had
passed
between
Eleanor
Harding
and
Mary
Bold
need
not
be
told
.
<EOS>
It
is
indeed
a
matter
of
thankfulness
that
neither
the
historian
nor
the
novelist
hears
all
that
is
said
by
their
heroes
or
heroines
,
or
how
would
three
volumes
or
twenty
suffice
!
<EOS>
In
the
present
case
so
little
of
this
sort
have
I
overheard
,
that
I
live
in
hopes
of
finishing
my
work
within
300
pages
,
and
of
completing
that
pleasant
task
 
a
novel
in
one
volume
;
but
something
had
passed
between
them
,
and
as
the
warden
blew
out
the
wax
candles
,
and
put
his
instrument
into
its
case
,
his
daughter
stood
sad
and
thoughtful
by
the
empty
fire
-
place
,
determined
to
speak
to
her
father
,
but
irresolute
as
to
what
she
would
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Eleanor
,
"
said
he
,
"
are
you
for
bed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
she
,
moving
,
"
I
suppose
so
;
but
papa
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bold
was
not
here
tonight
;
do
you
know
why
not
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
asked
;
I
wrote
to
him
myself
,
"
said
the
warden
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
do
you
know
why
he
did
not
come
,
papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Eleanor
,
I
could
guess
;
but
it
's
no
use
guessing
at
such
things
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
What
makes
you
look
so
earnest
about
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
papa
,
do
tell
me
,
"
she
exclaimed
,
throwing
her
arms
round
him
,
and
looking
into
his
face
;
"
what
is
it
he
is
going
to
do
?
<EOS>
What
is
it
all
about
?
<EOS>
Is
there
any
 
any
 
<EOS>
any
 
<EOS>
"
she
did
n't
well
know
what
word
to
use
 
"
any
danger
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Danger
,
my
dear
,
what
sort
of
danger
?
"
  
"
Danger
to
you
,
danger
of
trouble
,
and
of
loss
,
and
of
 
Oh
,
papa
,
why
have
n't
you
told
me
of
all
this
before
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
was
not
the
man
to
judge
harshly
of
anyone
,
much
less
of
the
daughter
whom
he
now
loved
better
than
any
living
creature
;
but
still
he
did
judge
her
wrongly
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
she
loved
John
Bold
;
he
fully
sympathised
in
her
affection
;
day
after
day
he
thought
more
of
the
matter
,
and
,
with
the
tender
care
of
a
loving
father
,
tried
to
arrange
in
his
own
mind
how
matters
might
be
so
managed
that
his
daughter
's
heart
should
not
be
made
the
sacrifice
to
the
dispute
which
was
likely
to
exist
between
him
and
Bold
.
<EOS>
Now
,
when
she
spoke
to
him
for
the
first
time
on
the
subject
,
it
was
natural
that
he
should
think
more
of
her
than
of
himself
,
and
that
he
should
imagine
that
her
own
cares
,
and
not
his
,
were
troubling
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
stood
silent
before
her
awhile
,
as
she
gazed
up
into
his
face
,
and
then
kissing
her
forehead
he
placed
her
on
the
sofa
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
Nelly
,
"
he
said
(
he
only
called
her
Nelly
in
his
kindest
,
softest
,
sweetest
moods
,
and
yet
all
his
moods
were
kind
and
sweet
)
,
"
tell
me
,
<EOS>
Nelly
,
do
you
like
Mr
Bold
 
much
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
quite
taken
aback
by
the
question
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
she
had
forgotten
herself
,
and
her
own
love
in
thinking
about
John
Bold
,
and
while
conversing
with
Mary
:
she
certainly
had
not
done
so
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
sick
at
heart
to
think
that
a
man
of
whom
she
could
not
but
own
to
herself
that
she
loved
him
,
of
whose
regard
she
had
been
so
proud
,
that
such
a
man
should
turn
against
her
father
to
ruin
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
felt
her
vanity
hurt
,
that
his
affection
for
her
had
not
kept
him
from
such
a
course
;
had
he
really
cared
for
her
,
he
would
not
have
risked
her
love
by
such
an
outrage
.
<EOS>
But
her
main
fear
had
been
for
her
father
,
and
when
she
spoke
of
danger
,
it
was
of
danger
to
him
and
not
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
taken
aback
by
the
question
altogether
:
"
Do
I
like
him
,
papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Nelly
,
do
you
like
him
?
<EOS>
Why
should
n't
you
like
him
?
<EOS>
but
that
's
a
poor
word
;
 
do
you
love
him
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
sat
still
in
his
arms
without
answering
him
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
had
not
prepared
herself
for
an
avowal
of
affection
,
intending
,
as
she
had
done
,
to
abuse
John
Bold
herself
,
and
to
hear
her
father
do
so
also
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
my
love
,
"
said
he
,
"
let
us
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
:
do
you
tell
me
what
concerns
yourself
,
and
I
will
tell
you
what
concerns
me
and
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
then
,
without
waiting
for
an
answer
,
he
described
to
her
,
as
he
best
could
,
the
accusation
that
was
made
about
Hiram
's
will
;
the
claims
which
the
old
men
put
forward
;
what
he
considered
the
strength
and
what
the
weakness
of
his
own
position
;
the
course
which
Bold
had
taken
,
and
that
which
he
presumed
he
was
about
to
take
;
and
then
by
degrees
,
without
further
question
,
he
presumed
on
the
fact
of
Eleanor
's
love
,
and
spoke
of
that
love
as
a
feeling
which
he
could
in
no
way
disapprove
:
he
apologised
for
Bold
,
excused
what
he
was
doing
;
nay
,
praised
him
for
his
energy
and
intentions
;
made
much
of
his
good
qualities
,
and
harped
on
none
of
his
foibles
;
then
,
reminding
his
daughter
how
late
it
was
,
and
comforting
her
with
much
assurance
which
he
hardly
felt
himself
,
he
sent
her
to
her
room
,
with
flowing
eyes
and
a
full
heart
.
  
<EOS>
When
Mr
Harding
met
his
daughter
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
,
there
was
no
further
discussion
on
the
matter
,
nor
was
the
subject
mentioned
between
them
for
some
days
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
the
party
Mary
Bold
called
at
the
hospital
,
but
there
were
various
persons
in
the
drawing
-
room
at
the
time
,
and
she
therefore
said
nothing
about
her
brother
.
<EOS>
On
the
day
following
,
John
Bold
met
Miss
Harding
in
one
of
the
quiet
,
sombre
,
shaded
walks
of
the
close
.
<EOS>
He
was
most
anxious
to
see
her
,
but
unwilling
to
call
at
the
warden
's
house
,
and
had
in
truth
waylaid
her
in
her
private
haunts
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
sister
tells
me
,
"
said
he
,
abruptly
hurrying
on
with
his
premeditated
speech
,
"
my
sister
tells
me
that
you
had
a
delightful
party
the
other
evening
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
sorry
<EOS>
I
could
not
be
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
were
all
sorry
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
with
dignified
composure
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
Miss
Harding
,
you
understand
<EOS>
why
,
at
this
moment
 
"
And
Bold
hesitated
,
muttered
,
stopped
,
commenced
his
explanation
again
,
and
again
broke
down
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
would
not
help
him
in
the
least
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
my
sister
explained
to
you
,
Miss
Harding
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
apologise
,
Mr
Bold
;
my
father
will
,
I
am
sure
,
always
be
glad
to
see
you
,
if
you
like
to
come
to
the
house
now
as
formerly
;
nothing
has
occurred
to
alter
his
feelings
:
of
your
own
views
<EOS>
you
are
,
of
course
,
the
best
judge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
father
is
all
that
is
kind
and
generous
;
he
always
was
so
;
but
you
,
Miss
Harding
,
yourself
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
not
judge
me
harshly
,
because
 
"
  
"
Mr
Bold
,
"
said
she
,
"
you
may
be
sure
of
one
thing
<EOS>
;
I
shall
always
judge
my
father
to
be
right
,
and
those
who
oppose
him
I
shall
judge
to
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
If
those
who
do
not
know
him
oppose
him
,
I
shall
have
charity
enough
to
believe
that
they
are
wrong
,
through
error
of
judgment
;
but
should
I
see
him
attacked
by
those
who
ought
to
know
him
,
and
to
love
him
,
and
revere
him
,
of
such
I
shall
be
constrained
to
form
a
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
then
curtseying
low
she
sailed
on
,
leaving
her
lover
in
anything
but
a
happy
state
of
mind
.

THE
JUPITER
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
Though
Eleanor
Harding
rode
off
from
John
Bold
on
a
high
horse
,
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
her
heart
was
so
elate
as
her
demeanour
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
she
had
a
natural
repugnance
to
losing
her
lover
;
and
in
the
next
,
she
was
not
quite
so
sure
that
she
was
in
the
right
as
she
pretended
to
be
.
<EOS>
Her
father
had
told
her
,
and
that
now
repeatedly
,
that
Bold
was
doing
nothing
unjust
or
ungenerous
;
and
why
then
should
she
rebuke
him
,
and
throw
him
off
,
when
she
felt
herself
so
ill
able
to
bear
his
loss
?
 
<EOS>
but
such
is
human
nature
,
and
young
-
lady
-
nature
especially
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
walked
off
from
him
beneath
the
shady
elms
of
the
close
,
her
look
,
her
tone
,
every
motion
and
gesture
of
her
body
,
belied
her
heart
;
she
would
have
given
the
world
to
have
taken
him
by
the
hand
,
to
have
reasoned
with
him
,
persuaded
him
,
cajoled
him
,
coaxed
him
out
of
his
project
;
to
have
overcome
him
with
all
her
female
artillery
,
and
to
have
redeemed
her
father
at
the
cost
of
herself
;
but
pride
would
not
let
her
do
this
,
and
she
left
him
without
a
look
of
love
or
a
word
of
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
Had
Bold
been
judging
of
another
lover
and
of
another
lady
,
he
might
have
understood
all
this
as
well
as
we
do
;
but
in
matters
of
love
men
do
not
see
clearly
in
their
own
affairs
.
<EOS>
They
say
that
faint
heart
never
won
fair
lady
;
and
it
is
amazing
to
me
how
fair
ladies
are
won
,
so
faint
are
often
men
's
hearts
!
<EOS>
Were
it
not
for
the
kindness
of
their
nature
,
that
seeing
the
weakness
of
our
courage
they
will
occasionally
descend
from
their
impregnable
fortresses
,
and
themselves
aid
us
in
effecting
their
own
defeat
,
too
often
would
they
escape
unconquered
if
not
unscathed
,
and
free
of
body
if
not
of
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Bold
crept
off
quite
crestfallen
;
he
felt
that
as
regarded
Eleanor
Harding
his
fate
was
sealed
,
unless
he
could
consent
to
give
up
a
task
to
which
he
had
pledged
himself
,
and
which
indeed
it
would
not
be
easy
for
him
to
give
up
.
<EOS>
Lawyers
were
engaged
,
and
the
question
had
to
a
certain
extent
been
taken
up
by
the
public
;
besides
,
how
could
a
high
-
spirited
girl
like
Eleanor
Harding
really
learn
to
love
a
man
for
neglecting
a
duty
which
he
assumed
!
<EOS>
Could
she
allow
her
affection
to
be
purchased
at
the
cost
of
his
own
self
-
respect
?
  
<EOS>
As
regarded
the
issue
of
his
attempt
at
reformation
in
the
hospital
,
Bold
had
no
reason
hitherto
to
be
discontented
with
his
success
.
<EOS>
All
Barchester
was
by
the
ears
about
it
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
,
the
archdeacon
,
the
warden
,
the
steward
,
and
several
other
clerical
allies
,
had
daily
meetings
,
discussing
their
tactics
,
and
preparing
for
the
great
attack
.
<EOS>
Sir
Abraham
Haphazard
had
been
consulted
,
but
his
opinion
was
not
yet
received
:
copies
of
Hiram
's
will
,
copies
of
wardens
'
journals
,
copies
of
leases
,
copies
of
accounts
,
copies
of
everything
that
could
be
copied
,
and
of
some
that
could
not
,
had
been
sent
to
him
;
and
the
case
was
assuming
most
creditable
dimensions
.
<EOS>
But
,
above
all
,
it
had
been
mentioned
in
the
daily
_
Jupiter
_
.
<EOS>
That
all
-
powerful
organ
of
the
press
in
one
of
its
leading
thunderbolts
launched
at
St
Cross
,
had
thus
remarked
:
"
Another
case
,
of
smaller
dimensions
indeed
,
but
of
similar
import
,
is
now
likely
to
come
under
public
notice
.
<EOS>
We
are
informed
that
the
warden
or
master
of
an
old
almshouse
attached
to
Barchester
Cathedral
is
in
receipt
of
twenty
-
five
times
the
annual
income
appointed
for
him
by
the
will
of
the
founder
,
while
the
sum
yearly
expended
on
the
absolute
purposes
of
the
charity
has
always
remained
fixed
.
<EOS>
In
other
words
,
the
legatees
under
the
founder
's
will
have
received
no
advantage
from
the
increase
in
the
value
of
the
property
during
the
last
four
centuries
,
such
increase
having
been
absorbed
by
the
so
-
called
warden
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
conceive
a
case
of
greater
injustice
.
<EOS>
It
is
no
answer
to
say
that
some
six
or
nine
or
twelve
old
men
receive
as
much
of
the
goods
of
this
world
as
such
old
men
require
.
<EOS>
On
what
foundation
,
moral
or
divine
,
traditional
or
legal
,
is
grounded
the
warden
's
claim
to
the
large
income
he
receives
for
doing
nothing
?
<EOS>
The
contentment
of
these
almsmen
,
if
content
they
be
,
can
give
him
no
title
to
this
wealth
!
<EOS>
Does
he
ever
ask
himself
,
when
he
stretches
wide
his
clerical
palm
to
receive
the
pay
of
some
dozen
of
the
working
clergy
,
for
what
service
he
is
so
remunerated
?
<EOS>
Does
his
conscience
ever
entertain
the
question
of
his
right
to
such
subsidies
?
<EOS>
Or
is
it
possible
that
the
subject
never
so
presents
itself
to
his
mind
;
that
he
has
received
for
many
years
,
and
intends
<EOS>
,
should
God
spare
him
,
to
receive
for
years
to
come
these
fruits
of
the
industrious
piety
of
past
ages
,
indifferent
as
to
any
right
on
his
own
part
,
or
of
any
injustice
to
others
!
<EOS>
We
must
express
an
opinion
that
nowhere
but
in
the
Church
of
England
,
and
only
there
among
its
priests
,
could
such
a
state
of
moral
indifference
be
found
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
must
for
the
present
leave
my
readers
to
imagine
the
state
of
Mr
Harding
's
mind
after
reading
the
above
article
.
<EOS>
They
say
that
forty
thousand
copies
of
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
are
daily
sold
,
and
that
each
copy
is
read
by
five
persons
at
the
least
.
<EOS>
Two
hundred
thousand
readers
then
would
hear
this
accusation
against
him
;
two
hundred
thousand
hearts
would
swell
with
indignation
at
the
griping
injustice
,
the
barefaced
robbery
of
the
warden
of
Barchester
Hospital
!
<EOS>
And
how
was
he
to
answer
this
?
<EOS>
How
was
he
to
open
his
inmost
heart
to
this
multitude
,
to
these
thousands
,
the
educated
,
the
polished
,
the
picked
men
of
his
own
country
;
how
show
them
that
he
was
no
robber
,
no
avaricious
,
lazy
priest
scrambling
for
gold
,
but
a
retiring
,
humble
-
spirited
man
,
who
had
innocently
taken
what
had
innocently
been
offered
to
him
?
  
<EOS>
"
Write

suggested
the

Yes

more

yes

smothered
with

over

with

shaken
this

that

as
a

in
the
mouth
of
a
practised
terrier

<EOS>
You
will
leave
out
some
word
or
letter
in
your
answer
,
and
the
ignorance
of
the
cathedral
clergy
will
be
harped
upon
;
you
will
make
some
small
mistake
,
which
will
be
a
falsehood
,
or
some
admission
,
which
will
be
self

condemnation
;
you
will
find
yourself
to
have
been
vulgar
,
ill
-
tempered
,
irreverend
,
and
illiterate
,
and
the
chances
are
ten
to
one

but
that
being
a

you
will
have
been
guilty
of
blasphemy

<EOS>
The
article
in
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
,
while
it
so
greatly
harassed
our
poor
warden
,
was
an
immense
triumph
to
some
of
the
opposite
party
.
<EOS>
Sorry
as
Bold
was
to
see
Mr
Harding
attacked
so
personally
,
it
still
gave
him
a
feeling
of
elation
to
find
his
cause
taken
up
by
so
powerful
an
advocate
:
and
as
to
Finney
,
the
attorney
,
he
was
beside
himself
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
to
be
engaged
in
the
same
cause
and
on
the
same
side
with
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
;
to
have
the
views
he
had
recommended
seconded
,
and
furthered
,
and
battled
for
by
_
The
Jupiter
_
!
<EOS>
Perhaps
to
have
his
own
name
mentioned
as
that
of
the
learned
gentleman
whose
efforts
had
been
so
successful
on
behalf
of
the
poor
of
Barchester
!
<EOS>
He
might
be
examined
before
committees
of
the
House
of
Commons
,
with
heaven
knows
how
much
a
day
for
his
personal
expenses
;
 
he
might
be
engaged
for
years
on
such
a
suit
!
<EOS>
There
was
no
end
to
the
glorious
golden
dreams
which
this
leader
in
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
produced
in
the
soaring
mind
of
Finney
.
  
<EOS>
And
the
old
bedesmen
,
they
also
heard
of
this
article
,
and
had
a
glimmering
,
indistinct
idea
of
the
marvellous
advocate
which
had
now
taken
up
their
cause
.
<EOS>
Abel
Handy
limped
hither
and
thither
through
the
rooms
,
repeating
all
that
he
understood
to
have
been
printed
,
with
some
additions
of
his
own
which
he
thought
should
have
been
added
.
<EOS>
He
told
them
how
_
The
Jupiter
_
had
declared
that
their
warden
was
no
better
than
a
robber
,
and
that
what
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
said
was
acknowledged
by
the
world
to
be
true
.
<EOS>
How
_
The
Jupiter
_
had
affirmed
that
each
one
of
them
 
"
each
one
of
us
,
Jonathan
Crumple
,
think
of
that
!
"
 
<EOS>
had
a
clear
right
to
a
hundred
a
year
;
and
that
if
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
had
said
so
<EOS>
,
it
was
better
than
a
decision
of
the
Lord
Chancellor
:
<EOS>
and
then
he
carried
about
the
paper
,
supplied
by
Mr
Finney
,
which
,
though
none
of
them
could
read
it
,
still
afforded
in
its
very
touch
and
aspect
positive
corroboration
of
what
was
told
them
;
and
Jonathan
Crumple
pondered
deeply
over
his
returning
wealth
;
and
Job
Skulpit
saw
how
right
he
had
been
in
signing
the
petition
,
and
said
so
many
scores
of
times
;
and
Spriggs
leered
fearfully
with
his
one
eye
;
and
Moody
,
as
he
more
nearly
approached
the
coming
golden
age
,
hated
more
deeply
than
ever
those
who
still
kept
possession
of
what
he
so
coveted
.
<EOS>
Even
Billy
Gazy
and
poor
bed
-
ridden
Bell
became
active
and
uneasy
,
and
the
great
Bunce
stood
apart
with
lowering
brow
,
with
deep
grief
seated
in
his
heart
,
for
he
perceived
that
evil
days
were
coming
.
  
<EOS>
It
had
been
decided
,
the
archdeacon
advising
,
that
no
remonstrance
,
explanation
,
or
defence
should
be
addressed
from
the
Barchester
conclave
to
the
editor
of
_
The
Jupiter
_
;
but
hitherto
that
was
the
only
decision
to
which
they
had
come
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Abraham
Haphazard
was
deeply
engaged
in
preparing
a
bill
for
the
mortification
of
papists
,
to
be
called
the
"
Convent
Custody
Bill
,
"
the
purport
of
which
was
to
enable
any
Protestant
clergyman
over
fifty
years
of
age
to
search
any
nun
whom
he
suspected
of
being
in
possession
of
treasonable
papers
or
Jesuitical
symbols
;
and
as
there
were
to
be
a
hundred
and
thirty
-
seven
clauses
in
the
bill
,
each
clause
containing
a
separate
thorn
for
the
side
of
the
papist
,
and
as
it
was
known
the
bill
would
be
fought
inch
by
inch
,
by
fifty
maddened
Irishmen
,
the
due
construction
and
adequate
dovetailing
of
it
<EOS>
did
consume
much
of
Sir
Abraham
's
time
.
<EOS>
The
bill
had
all
its
desired
effect
.
<EOS>
Of
course
it
never
passed
into
law
;
but
it
so
completely
divided
the
ranks
of
the
Irish
members
,
who
had
bound
themselves
together
to
force
on
the
ministry
a
bill
for
compelling
all
men
to
drink
Irish
whiskey
,
and
all
women
to
wear
Irish
poplins
,
that
for
the
remainder
of
the
session
the
Great
Poplin
and
Whiskey
League
was
utterly
harmless
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
it
happened
that
Sir
Abraham
's
opinion
was
not
at
once
forthcoming
,
and
the
uncertainty
,
the
expectation
,
and
suffering
of
the
folk
of
Barchester
was
maintained
at
a
high
pitch
.

PLUMSTEAD
EPISCOPI
 
<EOS>
The
reader
must
now
be
requested
to
visit
the
rectory
of
Plumstead
Episcopi
;
and
as
it
is
as
yet
still
early
morning
,
to
ascend
again
with
us
into
the
bedroom
of
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
The
mistress
of
the
mansion
was
at
her
toilet
;
on
which
we
will
not
dwell
with
profane
eyes
,
but
proceed
into
a
small
inner
room
,
where
the
doctor
dressed
and
kept
his
boots
and
sermons
;
and
here
we
will
take
our
stand
,
premising
that
the
door
of
the
room
was
so
open
as
to
admit
of
a
conversation
between
our
reverend
Adam
and
his
valued
Eve
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
your
own
fault
,
archdeacon
,
"
said
the
latter
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
from
the
beginning
how
it
would
end
,
and
papa
has
no
one
to
thank
but
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
appearing
at
the
door
of
his
dressing
-
room
,
with
his
face
and
head
enveloped
in
the
rough
towel
which
he
was
violently
using
;
"
how
can
you
say
so
?
<EOS>
I
am
doing
my
very
best
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
had
never
done
so
much
,
"
said
the
lady
,
interrupting
him
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
'd
just
have
let
John
Bold
come
and
go
there
,
as
he
and
papa
liked
,
he
and
Eleanor
would
have
been
married
by
this
time
,
and
we
should
not
have
heard
one
word
about
all
this
affair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
 
"
  
"
Oh
,
it
's
all
very
well
,
archdeacon
;
and
of
course
you
're
right
;
I
do
n't
for
a
moment
think
you
'll
ever
admit
that
you
could
be
wrong
;
but
the
fact
is
,
you
've
brought
this
young
man
down
upon
papa
by
huffing
him
as
you
have
done
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
love
 
"
  
"
And
all
because
you
did
n't
like
John
Bold
for
a
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
How
is
she
ever
to
do
better
?
<EOS>
Papa
has
n't
got
a
shilling
;
and
though
Eleanor
is
well
enough
,
she
has
not
at
all
a
taking
style
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
know
how
she
's
to
do
better
than
marry
John
Bold
;
or
as
well
indeed
,
"
added
the
anxious
sister
,
giving
the
last
twist
to
her
last
shoe
-
string
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Grantly
felt
keenly
the
injustice
of
this
attack
;
but
what
could
he
say
?
<EOS>
He
certainly
had
huffed
John
Bold
;
he
certainly
had
objected
to
him
as
a
brother
-
in
-
law
,
and
a
very
few
months
ago
the
very
idea
had
excited
his
wrath
:
but
now
matters
were
changed
;
John
Bold
had
shown
his
power
,
and
,
though
he
was
as
odious
as
ever
to
the
archdeacon
,
power
is
always
respected
,
and
the
reverend
dignitary
began
to
think
that
such
an
alliance
might
not
have
been
imprudent
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
his
motto
was
still
"
no
surrender
;
"
he
would
still
fight
it
out
;
he
believed
confidently
in
Oxford
,
in
the
bench
of
bishops
,
in
Sir
Abraham
Haphazard
,
and
in
himself
;
and
it
was
only
when
alone
with
his
wife
that
doubts
of
defeat
ever
beset
him
.
<EOS>
He
once
more
tried
to
communicate
this
confidence
to
Mrs
Grantly
,
and
for
the
twentieth
time
began
to
tell
her
of
Sir
Abraham
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Sir
Abraham
!
"
said
she
,
collecting
all
her
house
keys
into
her
basket
before
she
descended
;
"
Sir
Abraham
wo
n't
get
Eleanor
a
husband
;
Sir
Abraham
wo
n't
get
papa
another
income
when
he
has
been
worreted
out
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
Mark
what
I
tell
you
,
<EOS>
archdeacon
:
while
you
and
Sir
Abraham
are
fighting
,
papa
will
lose
his
preferment
;
and
what
will
you
do
then
with
him
and
Eleanor
on
your
hands
?
<EOS>
besides
,
who
's
to
pay
Sir
Abraham
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
wo
n't
take
the
case
up
for
nothing
?
"
<EOS>
And
so
the
lady
descended
to
family
worship
among
her
children
and
servants
,
the
pattern
of
a
good
and
prudent
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Grantly
was
blessed
with
a
happy
,
thriving
family
.
<EOS>
There
were
,
first
,
three
boys
,
now
at
home
from
school
for
the
holidays
.
<EOS>
They
were
called
,
respectively
,
Charles
James
,
Henry
,
and
Samuel
.
<EOS>
The
two
younger
(
there
were
five
in
all
)
were
girls
;
the
elder
,
Florinda
,
bore
the
name
of
the
Archbishop
of
York
's
wife
,
whose
godchild
she
was
:
and
the
younger
had
been
christened
Grizzel
,
after
a
sister
of
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
.
<EOS>
The
boys
were
all
clever
,
and
gave
good
promise
of
being
well
able
to
meet
the
cares
and
trials
of
the
world
;
and
yet
they
were
not
alike
in
their
dispositions
,
and
each
had
his
individual
character
,
and
each
his
separate
admirers
among
the
doctor
's
friends
.
  
<EOS>
Charles
James
was
an
exact
and
careful
boy
;
he
never
committed
himself
;
he
well
knew
how
much
was
expected
from
the
eldest
son
of
the
Archdeacon
of
Barchester
,
and
was
therefore
mindful
not
to
mix
too
freely
with
other
boys
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
the
great
talents
of
his
younger
brothers
,
but
he
exceeded
them
in
judgment
and
propriety
of
demeanour
;
his
fault
,
if
he
had
one
,
was
an
over
-
attention
to
words
instead
of
things
;
there
was
a
thought
too
much
finesse
about
him
,
and
,
as
even
his
father
sometimes
told
him
,
he
was
too
fond
of
a
compromise
.
  
<EOS>
The
second
was
the
archdeacon
's
favourite
son
,
and
Henry
was
indeed
a
brilliant
boy
.
<EOS>
The
versatility
of
his
genius
was
surprising
,
and
the
visitors
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
were
often
amazed
at
the
marvellous
manner
in
which
he
would
,
when
called
on
,
adapt
his
capacity
to
apparently
most
uncongenial
pursuits
.
<EOS>
He
appeared
once
before
a
large
circle
as
Luther
the
reformer
,
and
delighted
them
with
the
perfect
manner
in
which
he
assumed
the
character
;
and
within
three
days
he
again
astonished
them
by
acting
the
part
of
a
Capuchin
friar
to
the
very
life
.
<EOS>
For
this
last
exploit
his
father
gave
him
a
golden
guinea
,
and
his
brothers
said
the
reward
had
been
promised
beforehand
in
the
event
of
the
performance
being
successful
.
<EOS>
He
was
also
sent
on
a
tour
into
Devonshire
;
a
treat
which
the
lad
was
most
anxious
of
enjoying
.
<EOS>
His
father
's
friends
there
,
however
,
did
not
appreciate
his
talents
,
and
sad
accounts
were
sent
home
of
the
perversity
of
his
nature
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
most
courageous
lad
,
game
to
the
backbone
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
soon
known
,
both
at
home
,
where
he
lived
,
and
within
some
miles
of
Barchester
Cathedral
,
and
also
at
Westminster
,
where
he
was
at
school
,
that
young
Henry
could
box
well
and
would
never
own
himself
beat
;
other
boys
would
fight
while
they
had
a
leg
to
stand
on
,
but
he
would
fight
with
no
leg
at
all
.
<EOS>
Those
backing
him
would
sometimes
think
him
crushed
by
the
weight
of
blows
and
faint
with
loss
of
blood
,
and
his
friends
would
endeavour
to
withdraw
him
from
the
contest
;
but
no
,
Henry
never
gave
in
,
was
never
weary
of
the
battle
.
<EOS>
The
ring
was
the
only
element
in
which
he
seemed
to
enjoy
himself
;
and
while
other
boys
were
happy
in
the
number
of
their
friends
,
he
rejoiced
most
in
the
multitude
of
his
foes
.
  
<EOS>
His
relations
could
not
but
admire
his
pluck
,
but
they
sometimes
were
forced
to
regret
that
he
was
inclined
to
be
a
bully
;
and
those
not
so
partial
to
him
as
his
father
was
,
observed
with
pain
that
,
though
he
could
fawn
to
the
masters
and
the
archdeacon
's
friends
,
he
was
imperious
and
masterful
to
the
servants
and
the
poor
.
  
<EOS>
But
perhaps
Samuel
was
the
general
favourite
;
and
dear
little
Soapy
,
as
he
was
familiarly
called
,
was
as
engaging
a
child
as
ever
fond
mother
petted
.
<EOS>
He
was
soft
and
gentle
in
his
manners
,
and
attractive
in
his
speech
;
the
tone
of
his
voice
was
melody
,
and
every
action
was
a
grace
;
unlike
his
brothers
,
he
was
courteous
to
all
<EOS>
,
he
was
affable
to
the
lowly
,
and
meek
even
to
the
very
scullery
-
maid
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
boy
of
great
promise
,
minding
his
books
and
delighting
the
hearts
of
his
masters
.
<EOS>
His
brothers
,
however
,
were
not
particularly
fond
of
him
;
they
would
complain
to
their
mother
that
Soapy
's
civility
all
meant
something
;
they
thought
that
his
voice
was
too
often
listened
to
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
,
and
evidently
feared
that
,
as
he
grew
up
,
he
would
have
more
weight
in
the
house
than
either
of
them
;
there
was
,
therefore
,
a
sort
of
agreement
among
them
to
put
young
Soapy
down
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
not
so
easy
to
be
done
;
Samuel
,
though
young
,
was
sharp
;
he
could
not
assume
the
stiff
decorum
of
Charles
James
,
nor
could
he
fight
like
Henry
;
but
he
was
a
perfect
master
of
his
own
weapons
,
and
contrived
,
in
the
teeth
of
both
of
them
,
to
hold
the
place
which
he
had
assumed
.
<EOS>
Henry
declared
that
he
was
a
false
,
cunning
creature
;
and
Charles
James
,
though
he
always
spoke
of
him
as
his
dear
brother
Samuel
,
was
not
slow
to
say
a
word
against
him
when
opportunity
offered
.
<EOS>
To
speak
the
truth
,
Samuel
was
a
cunning
boy
,
and
those
even
who
loved
him
best
could
not
but
own
that
for
one
so
young
,
he
was
too
adroit
in
choosing
his
words
,
and
too
skilled
in
modulating
his
voice
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
little
girls
Florinda
and
Grizzel
were
nice
little
girls
enough
,
but
they
did
not
possess
the
strong
sterling
qualities
of
their
brothers
;
their
voices
were
not
often
heard
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
;
they
were
bashful
and
timid
by
nature
,
slow
to
speak
before
company
even
when
asked
to
do
so
;
and
though
they
looked
very
nice
in
their
clean
white
muslin
frocks
and
pink
sashes
,
they
were
but
little
noticed
by
the
archdeacon
's
visitors
.
  
<EOS>
Whatever
of
submissive
humility
may
have
appeared
in
the
gait
and
visage
of
the
archdeacon
during
his
colloquy
with
his
wife
in
the
sanctum
of
their
dressing
-
rooms
was
dispelled
as
he
entered
his
breakfast
-
parlour
with
erect
head
and
powerful
step
.
<EOS>
In
the
presence
of
a
third
person
he
assumed
the
lord
and
master
;
and
that
wise
and
talented
lady
too
well
knew
the
man
to
whom
her
lot
for
life
was
bound
,
to
stretch
her
authority
beyond
the
point
at
which
it
would
be
borne
.
<EOS>
Strangers
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
,
when
they
saw
the
imperious
brow
with
which
he
commanded
silence
from
the
large
circle
of
visitors
,
children
,
and
servants
who
came
together
in
the
morning
to
hear
him
read
the
word
of
God
,
and
watched
how
meekly
that
wife
seated
herself
behind
her
basket
of
keys
with
a
little
girl
on
each
side
,
as
she
caught
that
commanding
glance
;
strangers
,
I
say
,
seeing
this
,
could
little
guess
that
some
fifteen
minutes
since
she
had
stoutly
held
her
ground
against
him
,
hardly
allowing
him
to
open
his
mouth
in
his
own
defence
.
<EOS>
But
such
is
the
tact
and
talent
of
women
!
  
<EOS>
And
now
let
us
observe
the
well
-
furnished
breakfast
-
parlour
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
,
and
the
comfortable
air
of
all
the
belongings
of
the
rectory
.
<EOS>
Comfortable
they
certainly
were
,
but
neither
gorgeous
nor
even
grand
;
indeed
,
considering
the
money
that
had
been
spent
there
,
the
eye
and
taste
might
have
been
better
served
;
there
was
an
air
of
heaviness
about
the
rooms
which
might
have
been
avoided
without
any
sacrifice
of
propriety
;
colours
might
have
been
better
chosen
and
lights
more
perfectly
diffused
;
but
perhaps
in
doing
so
the
thorough
clerical
aspect
of
the
whole
might
have
been
somewhat
marred
;
at
any
rate
,
it
was
not
without
ample
consideration
that
those
thick
,
dark
,
costly
carpets
were
put
down
;
those
embossed
,
but
sombre
papers
hung
up
;
those
heavy
curtains
draped
so
as
to
half
exclude
the
light
of
the
sun
:
nor
were
these
old
-
fashioned
chairs
,
bought
at
a
price
far
exceeding
that
now
given
for
more
modern
goods
,
without
a
purpose
.
<EOS>
The
breakfast
-
service
on
the
table
was
equally
costly
and
equally
plain
;
the
apparent
object
had
been
to
spend
money
without
obtaining
brilliancy
or
splendour
.
<EOS>
The
urn
was
of
thick
and
solid
silver
,
as
were
also
the
tea
-
pot
,
coffee
-
pot
,
cream
-
ewer
,
and
sugar
-
bowl
;
the
cups
were
old
,
dim
dragon
china
,
worth
about
a
pound
a
piece
,
but
very
despicable
in
the
eyes
of
the
uninitiated
.
<EOS>
The
silver
forks
were
so
heavy
as
to
be
disagreeable
to
the
hand
,
and
the
bread
-
basket
was
of
a
weight
really
formidable
to
any
but
robust
persons
.
<EOS>
The
tea
consumed
was
the
very
best
,
the
coffee
the
very
blackest
,
the
cream
<EOS>
the
very
thickest
;
there
was
dry
toast
and
buttered
toast
,
muffins
and
crumpets
;
hot
bread
and
cold
bread
,
white
bread
and
brown
bread
,
home
-
made
bread
and
bakers
'
bread
,
wheaten
bread
and
oaten
bread
;
and
if
there
be
other
breads
than
these
,
they
were
there
;
there
were
eggs
in
napkins
,
and
crispy
bits
of
bacon
under
silver
covers
;
and
there
were
little
fishes
in
a
little
box
,
and
devilled
kidneys
frizzling
on
a
hot
-
water
dish
;
which
,
by
the
bye
,
were
placed
closely
contiguous
to
the
plate
of
the
worthy
archdeacon
himself
.
<EOS>
Over
and
above
this
,
on
a
snow
-
white
napkin
,
spread
upon
the
sideboard
,
was
a
huge
ham
and
a
huge
sirloin
;
the
latter
having
laden
the
dinner
table
on
the
previous
evening
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
ordinary
fare
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
I
have
never
found
the
rectory
a
pleasant
house
.
<EOS>
The
fact
that
man
shall
not
live
by
bread
alone
seemed
to
be
somewhat
forgotten
;
and
noble
as
was
the
appearance
of
the
host
,
and
sweet
and
good
-
natured
as
was
the
face
of
the
hostess
,
talented
as
were
the
children
,
and
excellent
as
were
the
viands
and
the
wines
,
in
spite
of
these
attractions
,
I
generally
found
the
rectory
somewhat
dull
.
<EOS>
After
breakfast
the
archdeacon
would
retire
,
of
course
to
his
clerical
pursuits
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Grantly
,
I
presume
,
inspected
her
kitchen
,
though
she
had
a
first
-
rate
housekeeper
,
with
sixty
pounds
a
year
;
and
attended
to
the
lessons
of
Florinda
and
Grizzel
,
though
she
had
an
excellent
governess
with
thirty
pounds
a
year
:
<EOS>
but
at
any
rate
she
disappeared
:
<EOS>
and
I
never
could
make
companions
of
the
boys
.
<EOS>
Charles
James
,
though
he
always
looked
as
though
there
was
something
in
him
,
never
seemed
to
have
much
to
say
;
and
what
he
did
say
he
would
always
unsay
the
next
minute
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
once
that
he
considered
cricket
,
on
the
whole
,
to
be
a
gentleman
-
like
game
for
boys
,
provided
they
would
play
without
running
about
;
and
that
fives
,
also
,
was
a
seemly
game
,
so
that
those
who
played
it
never
heated
themselves
.
<EOS>
Henry
once
quarrelled
with
me
for
taking
his
sister
Grizzel
's
part
in
a
contest
between
them
as
to
the
best
mode
of
using
a
watering
-
pot
for
the
garden
flowers
;
and
from
that
day
to
this
he
has
not
spoken
to
me
,
though
he
speaks
at
me
often
enough
.
<EOS>
For
half
an
hour
or
so
I
certainly
did
like
Sammy
's
gentle
speeches
;
but
one
gets
tired
of
honey
,
and
I
found
that
he
preferred
the
more
admiring
listeners
whom
he
met
in
the
kitchen
-
garden
and
back
precincts
of
the
establishment
;
besides
,
I
think
I
once
caught
Sammy
fibbing
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
whole
,
therefore
,
I
found
the
rectory
a
dull
house
,
though
it
must
be
admitted
that
everything
there
was
of
the
very
best
.
  
<EOS>
After
breakfast
,
on
the
morning
of
which
we
are
writing
,
the
archdeacon
,
as
usual
,
retired
to
his
study
,
intimating
that
he
was
going
to
be
very
busy
,
but
that
he
would
see
Mr
Chadwick
if
he
called
.
<EOS>
On
entering
this
sacred
room
he
carefully
opened
the
paper
case
on
which
he
was
wo
nt
to
compose
his
favourite
sermons
,
and
spread
on
it
a
fair
sheet
of
paper
and
one
partly
written
on
;
he
then
placed
his
inkstand
,
looked
at
his
pen
,
and
folded
his
blotting
paper
;
having
done
so
,
he
got
up
again
from
his
seat
,
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
-
place
,
and
yawned
comfortably
,
stretching
out
vastly
his
huge
arms
and
opening
his
burly
chest
.
<EOS>
He
then
walked
across
the
room
and
locked
the
door
;
and
having
so
prepared
himself
,
he
threw
himself
into
his
easy
-
chair
,
took
from
a
secret
drawer
beneath
his
table
a
volume
of
Rabelais
,
and
began
to
amuse
himself
with
the
witty
mischief
of
Panurge
;
and
so
passed
the
archdeacon
's
morning
on
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
left
undisturbed
at
his
studies
for
an
hour
or
two
,
when
a
knock
came
to
the
door
,
and
Mr
Chadwick
was
announced
.
<EOS>
Rabelais
retired
into
the
secret
drawer
,
the
easy
-
chair
seemed
knowingly
to
betake
itself
off
,
and
when
the
archdeacon
quickly
undid
his
bolt
,
he
was
discovered
by
the
steward
working
,
as
usual
,
for
that
church
of
which
he
was
so
useful
<EOS>
a
pillar
.
<EOS>
Mr
Chadwick
had
just
come
from
London
,
and
was
,
therefore
,
known
to
be
the
bearer
of
important
news
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
've
got
Sir
Abraham
's
opinion
at
last
,
"
said
Mr
Chadwick
,
as
he
seated
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
well
!
"
exclaimed
the
archdeacon
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
as
long
as
my
arm
,
"
said
the
other
;
"
it
ca
n't
be
told
in
a
word
,
but
you
can
read
it
;
"
and
he
handed
him
a
copy
,
<EOS>
in
heaven
knows
how
many
spun
-
out
folios
,
of
the
opinion
which
the
attorney
-
general
had
managed
to
cram
on
the
back
and
sides
of
the
case
as
originally
submitted
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
upshot
is
,
"
said
Chadwick
,
"
that
there
's
a
screw
loose
in
their
case
,
and
we
had
better
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
They
are
proceeding
against
Mr
Harding
and
myself
,
and
Sir
Abraham
holds
that
,
under
the
wording
of
the
will
,
and
subsequent
arrangements
legally
sanctioned
,
Mr
Harding
and
I
are
only
paid
servants
.
<EOS>
The
defendants
should
have
been
either
the
Corporation
of
Barchester
,
or
possibly
the
chapter
of
your
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
W
-
hoo
!
"
said
the
archdeacon
;
"
so
Master
Bold
is
on
the
wrong
scent
,
is
he
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
Sir
Abraham
's
opinion
;
but
any
scent
almost
would
be
a
wrong
scent
.
<EOS>
Sir
Abraham
thinks
that
if
they
'd
taken
the
corporation
,
or
the
chapter
,
we
could
have
baffled
them
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
,
he
thinks
,
would
be
the
surest
shot
;
but
even
there
we
could
plead
that
the
bishop
is
only
a
visitor
,
and
that
he
has
never
made
himself
a
consenting
party
to
the
performance
of
other
duties
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
quite
clear
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
so
clear
,
"
said
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
the
will
says
,
"
My
lord
,
the
bishop
,
being
graciously
pleased
to
see
that
due
justice
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
it
may
be
a
question
whether
,
in
accepting
and
administering
the
patronage
,
your
father
has
not
accepted
also
the
other
duties
assigned
.
<EOS>
It
is
doubtful
,
however
;
but
even
if
they
hit
that
nail
,
 
and
they
are
far
off
from
that
yet
,
 
the
point
is
so
nice
,
as
Sir
Abraham
says
,
that
you
would
force
them
into
fifteen
thousand
pounds
'
cost
before
they
could
bring
it
to
an
issue
!
<EOS>
and
where
's
that
sum
of
money
to
come
from

The
archdeacon
rubbed
his
hands
with
delight
;
he
had
never
doubted
the
justice
of
his
case
,
but
he
had
begun
to
have
some
dread
of
unjust
success
on
the
part
of
his
enemies
.
<EOS>
It
was
delightful
to
him
thus
to
hear
that
their
cause
was
surrounded
with
such
rocks
and
shoals
;
such
causes
of
shipwreck
unseen
by
the
landsman
's
eye
,
but
visible
enough
to
the
keen
eyes
of
practical
law
mariners
.
<EOS>
How
wrong
his
wife
was
to
wish
that
Bold
should
marry
Eleanor
!
<EOS>
Bold
!
<EOS>
why
,
if
he
should
be
ass
enough
to
persevere
,
he
would
be
a
beggar
before
he
knew
whom
he
was
at
law
with
!
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
excellent
,
Chadwick
;
 
that
's
excellent
!
<EOS>
I
told
you
Sir
Abraham
was
the
man
for
us
;
"
and
he
put
down
on
the
table
the
copy
of
the
opinion
,
and
patted
it
fondly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
let
that
be
seen
,
though
,
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
?
 
I
!
 
not
for
worlds
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
People
will
talk
,
you
know
,
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
of
course
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
,
if
that
gets
abroad
,
it
would
teach
them
how
to
fight
their
own
battle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
true
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
one
here
in
Barchester
ought
to
see
that
<EOS>
but
you
and
I
,
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
certainly
no
one
else
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
pleased
with
the
closeness
of
the
confidence
;
"
no
one
else
shall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Grantly
is
very
interested
in
the
matter
,
I
know
,
"
said
Mr
Chadwick
.
  
<EOS>
Did
the
archdeacon
wink
,
or
did
he
not
?
<EOS>
I
am
inclined
to
think
he
did
not
quite
wink
;
but
that
without
such
,
perhaps
,
unseemly
gesture
he
communicated
to
Mr
Chadwick
,
with
the
corner
of
his
eye
,
intimation
that
,
deep
as
was
Mrs
Grantly
's
interest
in
the
matter
,
it
should
not
procure
for
her
a
perusal
of
that
document
;
and
at
the
same
time
he
partly
opened
the
small
drawer
,
above
spoken
of
,
deposited
the
paper
on
the
volume
of
Rabelais
,
and
showed
to
Mr
Chadwick
the
nature
of
the
key
which
guarded
these
hidden
treasures
.
<EOS>
The
careful
steward
then
expressed
himself
contented
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
vain
man
!
<EOS>
he
could
fasten
up
his
Rabelais
,
and
other
things
secret
,
with
all
the
skill
of
Bramah
or
of
Chubb
;
but
where
could
he
fasten
up
the
key
which
solved
these
mechanical
mysteries
?
<EOS>
It
is
probable
to
us
that
the
contents
of
no
drawer
in
that
house
were
unknown
to
its
mistress
,
and
we
think
,
moreover
,
that
she
was
entitled
to
all
such
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
said
Mr
Chadwick
,
"
we
must
,
of
course
,
tell
your
father
and
Mr
Harding
<EOS>
so
much
of
Sir
Abraham
's
opinion
as
will
satisfy
them
that
the
matter
is
doing
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
,
 
yes
,
of
course
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
let
them
know
that
Sir
Abraham
is
of
opinion
that
there
is
no
case
at
any
rate
against
Mr
Harding
;
and
that
as
the
action
is
worded
at
present
,
it
must
fall
to
the
ground
;
they
must
be
nonsuited
,
if
they
carry
it
on
;
you
had
better
tell
Mr
Harding
,
that
Sir
Abraham
is
clearly
of
opinion
that
he
is
only
a
servant
,
and
as
such
not
liable
;
 
or
if
you
like
it
,
I
'll
see
Mr
Harding
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
must
see
him
to
-
morrow
,
and
my
father
too
,
and
I
'll
explain
to
them
exactly
so
much
;
 
you
wo
n't
go
before
lunch
,
Mr
Chadwick
:
<EOS>
well
,
if
you
will
,
you
must
,
for
I
know
your
time
is
precious
;
"
and
he
shook
hands
with
the
diocesan
steward
,
and
bowed
him
out
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
had
again
recourse
to
his
drawer
,
and
twice
read
through
the
essence
of
Sir
Abraham
Haphazard
's
law
-
enlightened
and
law
-
bewildered
brains
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
clear
that
to
Sir
Abraham
,
the
justice
of
the
old
men
's
claim
or
the
justice
of
Mr
Harding
's
defence
were
ideas
that
had
never
presented
themselves
.
<EOS>
A
legal
victory
over
an
opposing
party
was
the
service
for
which
Sir
Abraham
was
,
as
he
imagined
,
to
be
paid
;
and
that
he
,
according
to
his
lights
,
had
diligently
laboured
to
achieve
,
and
with
probable
hope
of
success
.
<EOS>
Of
the
intense
desire
which
Mr
Harding
felt
to
be
assured
on
fit
authority
that
he
was
wronging
no
man
,
that
he
was
entitled
in
true
equity
to
his
income
,
that
he
might
sleep
at
night
without
pangs
of
conscience
,
that
he
was
no
robber
,
no
spoiler
of
the
poor
;
that
he
and
all
the
world
might
be
openly
convinced
that
he
was
not
the
man
which
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
had
described
him
to
be
;
of
such
longings
on
the
part
of
Mr
Harding
,
Sir
Abraham
was
entirely
ignorant
;
nor
,
indeed
,
could
it
be
looked
on
as
part
of
his
business
to
gratify
such
desires
.
<EOS>
Such
was
not
the
system
on
which
his
battles
were
fought
,
and
victories
gained
.
<EOS>
Success
was
his
object
,
and
he
was
generally
successful
.
<EOS>
He
conquered
his
enemies
by
their
weakness
rather
than
by
his
own
strength
,
and
it
had
been
found
almost
impossible
to
make
up
a
case
in
which
Sir
Abraham
,
as
an
antagonist
,
would
not
find
a
flaw
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
was
delighted
with
the
closeness
of
the
reasoning
.
<EOS>
To
do
him
justice
,
it
was
not
a
selfish
triumph
that
he
desired
;
he
would
personally
lose
nothing
by
defeat
,
or
at
least
what
he
might
lose
did
not
actuate
him
;
but
neither
was
it
love
of
justice
which
made
him
so
anxious
,
nor
even
mainly
solicitude
for
his
father
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
He
was
fighting
a
part
of
a
never
-
ending
battle
against
a
never
-
conquered
foe
 
that
of
the
church
against
its
enemies
.
  
<EOS>
He
knew
Mr
Harding
could
not
pay
all
the
expense
of
these
doings
:
for
these
long
opinions
of
Sir
Abraham
's
,
these
causes
to
be
pleaded
,
these
speeches
to
be
made
,
these
various
courts
through
which
the
case
was
,
he
presumed
,
to
be
dragged
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
and
his
father
must
at
least
bear
the
heavier
portion
of
this
tremendous
cost
;
but
to
do
the
archdeacon
justice
,
he
did
not
recoil
from
this
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
fond
of
obtaining
money
,
greedy
of
a
large
income
,
but
open
-
handed
enough
in
expending
it
,
and
it
was
a
triumph
to
him
to
foresee
the
success
of
this
measure
,
although
he
might
be
called
on
to
pay
so
dearly
for
it
himself
.
   
<EOS>
THE
CONFERENCE
 
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
the
archdeacon
was
with
his
father
betimes
,
and
a
note
was
sent
down
to
the
warden
begging
his
attendance
at
the
palace
.
<EOS>
Dr
<EOS>
Grantly
,
as
he
cogitated
on
the
matter
,
leaning
back
in
his
brougham
as
he
journeyed
into
Barchester
,
felt
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
communicate
his
own
satisfaction
either
to
his
father
or
his
father
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
success
on
his
own
side
and
discomfiture
on
that
of
his
enemies
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
wanted
peace
on
the
subject
;
a
settled
peace
if
possible
,
but
peace
at
any
rate
till
the
short
remainder
of
his
own
days
had
spun
itself
out
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
required
not
only
success
and
peace
,
but
he
also
demanded
that
he
might
stand
justified
before
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
,
however
,
was
comparatively
easy
to
deal
with
;
and
before
the
arrival
of
the
other
,
the
dutiful
son
had
persuaded
his
father
that
all
was
going
on
well
,
and
then
the
warden
arrived
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
Mr
Harding
's
wo
nt
,
whenever
he
spent
a
morning
at
the
palace
,
to
seat
himself
immediately
at
the
bishop
's
elbow
,
the
bishop
occupying
a
huge
arm
-
chair
fitted
up
with
candle
-
sticks
,
a
reading
table
,
a
drawer
,
and
other
paraphernalia
,
the
position
of
which
chair
was
never
moved
,
summer
or
winter
;
and
when
,
as
was
usual
,
the
archdeacon
was
there
also
,
he
confronted
the
two
elders
,
who
thus
were
enabled
to
fight
the
battle
against
him
together
;
 
and
together
submit
to
defeat
,
for
such
was
their
constant
fate
.
  
<EOS>
Our
warden
now
took
his
accustomed
place
,
having
greeted
his
son
-
in
-
law
as
he
entered
,
and
then
affectionately
inquired
after
his
friend
's
health
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
gentleness
about
the
bishop
to
which
the
soft
womanly
affection
of
Mr
Harding
particularly
endeared
itself
,
and
it
was
quaint
to
see
how
the
two
mild
old
priests
pressed
each
other
's
hand
,
and
smiled
and
made
little
signs
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Abraham
's
opinion
has
come
at
last
,
"
began
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
had
heard
so
much
,
and
was
most
anxious
to
know
the
result
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
quite
favourable
,
"
said
the
bishop
,
pressing
his
friend
's
arm
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
looked
at
the
mighty
bearer
of
the
important
news
for
confirmation
of
these
glad
tidings
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
;
"
Sir
Abraham
has
given
most
minute
attention
to
the
case
;
indeed
,
I
knew
he
would
;
 
most
minute
attention
;
and
his
opinion
is
,
 
and
as
to
his
opinion
on
such
a
subject
being
correct
,
no
one
who
knows
Sir
Abraham
's
character
can
doubt
,
 
his
opinion
is
,
that
they
hav'n"t
got
a
leg
to
stand
on
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
as
how
,
archdeacon
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
in
the
first
place
:
 
but
you
're
no
lawyer
,
warden
,
and
I
doubt
you
wo
n't
understand
it
;
the
gist
of
the
matter
is
this
:
 
under
Hiram
's
<EOS>
will
two
paid
guardians
have
been
selected
for
the
hospital
;
the
law
will
say
two
paid
servants
,
and
you
and
I
wo
n't
quarrel
with
the
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
I
will
not
if
I
am
one
of
the
servants
,
"
said
Mr
Harding
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
rose
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
impatient
of
poetry
at
such
a
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
two
paid
servants
,
we
'll
say
;
one
to
look
after
the
men
,
and
the
other
to
look
after
the
money
.
<EOS>
You
and
Chadwick
are
these
two
servants
,
and
whether
either
of
you
be
paid
too
much
,
or
too
little
,
more
or
less
in
fact
than
the
founder
willed
,
it
's
as
clear
as
daylight
that
no
one
can
fall
foul
of
either
of
you
for
receiving
an
allotted
stipend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
does
seem
clear
,
"
said
the
bishop
,
who
had
winced
visibly
at
the
words
servants
and
stipend
,
which
,
however
,
appeared
to
have
caused
no
uneasiness
to
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
clear
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
very
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
In
point
of
fact
,
it
being
necessary
to
select
such
servants
for
the
use
of
the
hospital
,
the
pay
to
be
given
to
them
must
depend
on
the
rate
of
pay
for
such
services
,
according
to
their
market
value
at
the
period
in
question
;
and
those
who
manage
the
hospital
must
be
the
only
judges
of
this
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
who
does
manage
the
hospital
?
"
asked
the
warden
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
let
them
find
that
out
;
that
's
another
question
:
the
action
is
brought
against
you
and
Chadwick
;
that
's
your
defence
,
and
a
perfect
and
full
defence
it
is
.
<EOS>
Now
that
I
think
very
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
the
bishop
,
looking
inquiringly
up
into
his
friend
's
face
,
who
sat
silent
awhile
,
and
apparently
not
so
well
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
conclusive
,
"
continued
the
archdeacon
;
"
if
they
press
it
to
a
jury
,
which
they
wo
n't
do
,
no
twelve
men
in
England
will
take
five
minutes
to
decide
against
them
.
"
  
"
But
according
to
that
"
said
Mr
Harding
,
"
I
might
as
well
have
sixteen
hundred
a
year
as
eight
,
if
the
managers
choose
to
allot
it
to
me
;
and
as
I
am
one
of
the
managers
,
if
not
the
chief
manager
,
myself
,
that
can
hardly
be
a
just
arrangement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
well
;
all
that
's
nothing
to
the
question
.
<EOS>
The
question
is
,
whether
this
intruding
fellow
,
and
a
lot
of
cheating
attorneys
and
pestilent
dissenters
,
are
to
interfere
with
an
arrangement
which
everyone
knows
is
essentially
just
and
serviceable
to
the
church
.
<EOS>
Pray
do
n't
let
us
be
splitting
hairs
,
and
that
amongst
ourselves
,
or
<EOS>
there
'll
never
be
an
end
of
the
cause
or
the
cost
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
again
sat
silent
for
a
while
,
during
which
the
bishop
once
and
again
pressed
his
arm
,
and
looked
in
his
face
to
see
if
he
could
catch
a
gleam
of
a
contented
and
eased
mind
;
but
there
was
no
such
gleam
,
and
the
poor
warden
continued
playing
sad
dirges
on
invisible
stringed
instruments
in
all
manner
of
positions
;
he
was
ruminating
in
his
mind
on
this
opinion
of
Sir
Abraham
,
looking
to
it
wearily
and
earnestly
for
satisfaction
,
but
finding
none
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
said
,
"
Did
you
see
the
opinion
,
archdeacon
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
said
he
had
not
,
 
that
was
to
say
,
he
had
,
 
that
was
,
he
had
not
seen
the
opinion
itself
;
he
had
seen
what
had
been
called
a
copy
,
but
he
could
not
say
whether
of
a
whole
or
part
;
nor
could
he
say
that
what
he
had
seen
were
the
_
ipsissima
verba
_
of
the
great
man
himself
;
but
what
he
had
seen
contained
exactly
the
decision
which
he
had
announced
,
and
which
he
again
declared
to
be
to
his
mind
extremely
satisfactory
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
see
the
opinion
,
"
said
the
warden
;
"
that
is
,
a
copy
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
suppose
you
can
if
you
make
a
point
of
it
;
but
I
do
n't
see
the
use
myself
;
of
course
it
is
essential
that
the
purport
of
it
should
not
be
known
,
and
it
is
therefore
unadvisable
to
multiply
copies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
it
not
be
known
?
"
asked
the
warden
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
question
for
a
man
to
ask
!
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
throwing
up
his
hands
in
token
of
his
surprise
;
"
but
it
is
like
you
:
 
<EOS>
a
child
is
not
more
innocent
than
you
are
in
matters
of
business
.
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
see
that
if
we
tell
them
that
no
action
will
lie
against
you
,
but
that
one
may
possibly
lie
against
some
other
person
or
persons
,
that
we
shall
be
putting
weapons
into
their
hands
,
and
be
teaching
them
how
to
cut
our
own
throats
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
warden
again
sat
silent
,
and
the
bishop
again
looked
at
him
wistfully
.
<EOS>
"
The
only
thing
we
have
now
to
do
,
"
continued
the
archdeacon
,
"
is
to
remain
quiet
,
hold
our
peace
,
and
let
them
play
their
own
game
as
they
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
not
to
make
known
then
,
"
said
the
warden
,
"
that
we
have
consulted
the
attorney
-
general
,
and
that
we
are
advised
by
him
that
the
founder
's
will
is
fully
and
fairly
carried
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
my
soul
!
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
"
how
odd
it
is
that
you
will
not
see
that
all
we
are
to
do
is
to
do
nothing
<EOS>
:
why
should
we
say
anything
about
the
founder
's
will
?
<EOS>
We
are
in
possession
;
and
we
know
that
they
are
not
in
a
position
to
put
us
out
;
surely
that
is
enough
for
the
present
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
rose
from
his
seat
and
paced
thoughtfully
up
and
down
the
library
,
the
bishop
the
while
watching
him
painfully
at
every
turn
,
and
the
archdeacon
continuing
to
pour
forth
his
convictions
that
the
affair
was
in
a
state
to
satisfy
any
prudent
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
_
The
Jupiter
_
?
"
said
the
warden
,
stopping
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
,
"
answered
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
can
break
no
bones
.
<EOS>
You
must
bear
with
that
;
there
is
much
,
of
course
,
which
it
is
our
bounden
duty
to
bear
;
it
can
not
be
all
roses
for
us
here
,
"
and
the
archdeacon
looked
exceedingly
moral
;
"
besides
,
the
matter
is
too
trivial
,
of
too
little
general
interest
to
be
mentioned
again
in
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
,
unless
we
stir
up
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
And
the
archdeacon
again
looked
exceedingly
knowing
and
worldly
wise
.
  
<EOS>
The
warden
continued
his
walk
;
the
hard
and
stinging
words
of
that
newspaper
article
,
each
one
of
which
had
thrust
a
thorn
as
it
were
into
his
inmost
soul
,
were
fresh
in
his
memory
;
he
had
read
it
more
than
once
,
word
by
word
,
and
what
was
worse
,
he
fancied
it
was
as
well
known
to
everyone
as
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Was
he
to
be
looked
on
as
the
unjust
griping
priest
he
had
been
there
described
?
<EOS>
Was
he
to
be
pointed
at
as
the
consumer
of
the
bread
of
the
poor
,
and
to
be
allowed
no
means
of
refuting
such
charges
,
of
clearing
his
begrimed
name
,
of
standing
innocent
in
the
world
,
as
hitherto
he
had
stood
?
<EOS>
Was
he
to
bear
all
this
,
to
receive
as
usual
his
now
hated
income
,
and
be
known
as
one
of
those
greedy
priests
who
by
their
rapacity
have
brought
disgrace
on
their
church
?
<EOS>
And
why
?
<EOS>
Why
should
he
bear
all
this
?
<EOS>
Why
should
he
die
,
for
he
felt
that
he
could
not
live
,
under
such
a
weight
of
obloquy
?
<EOS>
As
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
he
resolved
in
his
misery
and
enthusiasm
that
he
could
with
pleasure
,
if
he
were
allowed
,
give
up
his
place
,
abandon
his
pleasant
home
,
leave
the
hospital
,
and
live
poorly
,
happily
,
and
with
an
unsullied
name
,
on
the
small
remainder
of
his
means
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
somewhat
shy
of
speaking
of
himself
,
even
before
those
who
knew
him
best
,
and
whom
he
loved
the
most
;
but
at
last
it
burst
forth
from
him
,
and
with
a
somewhat
jerking
eloquence
he
declared
that
he
could
not
,
would
not
,
bear
this
misery
any
longer
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
can
be
proved
,
"
said
he
at
last
,
"
that
I
have
a
just
and
honest
right
to
this
,
as
God
well
knows
I
always
deemed
I
had
;
if
this
salary
or
stipend
be
really
my
due
,
I
am
not
less
anxious
than
another
to
retain
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
well
-
being
of
my
child
to
look
to
.
<EOS>
I
am
too
old
to
miss
without
some
pain
the
comforts
to
which
I
have
been
used
;
and
I
am
,
as
others
are
,
anxious
to
prove
to
the
world
that
I
have
been
right
,
and
to
uphold
the
place
I
have
held
;
but
I
can
not
do
it
at
such
a
cost
as
this
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
this
.
<EOS>
Could
you
tell
me
to
do
so
?
"
<EOS>
And
he
appealed
,
almost
in
tears
,
to
the
bishop
,
who
had
left
his
chair
,
and
was
now
leaning
on
the
warden
's
arm
as
he
stood
on
the
further
side
of
the
table
facing
the
archdeacon
.
"
<EOS>
Could
you
tell
me
to
sit
there
at
ease
,
indifferent
,
and
satisfied
,
while
such
things
as
these
are
said
loudly
of
me
in
the
world
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
could
feel
for
him
and
sympathise
with
him
,
but
he
could
not
advise
him
;
he
could
only
say
,
"
No
,
no
,
you
shall
be
asked
to
do
nothing
that
is
painful
;
you
shall
do
just
what
your
heart
tells
you
to
be
right
;
you
shall
do
whatever
you
think
best
yourself
.
<EOS>
Theophilus
,
do
n't
advise
him
,
pray
<EOS>
do
n't
advise
the
warden
to
do
anything
which
is
painful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
archdeacon
,
though
he
could
not
sympathise
,
could
advise
;
and
he
saw
that
the
time
had
come
when
it
behoved
him
to
do
so
in
a
somewhat
peremptory
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
lord
,
"
he
said
,
speaking
to
his
father
;
 
and
when
he
called
his
father
"
my
lord
,
"
the
good
old
bishop
shook
in
his
shoes
,
for
he
knew
that
an
evil
time
was
coming
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
lord
,
there
are
two
ways
of
giving
advice
:
there
is
advice
that
may
be
good
for
the
present
day
;
and
there
is
advice
that
may
be
good
for
days
to
come
:
now
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
give
the
former
,
if
it
be
incompatible
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
I
suppose
not
,
"
said
the
bishop
,
re
-
seating
himself
,
and
shading
his
face
with
his
hands
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
sat
down
with
his
back
to
the
further
wall
,
playing
to
himself
some
air
fitted
for
so
calamitous
an
occasion
,
and
the
archdeacon
said
out
his
say
standing
,
with
his
back
to
the
empty
fire
-
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
to
be
supposed
but
that
much
pain
will
spring
out
of
this
unnecessarily
raised
question
.
<EOS>
We
must
all
have
foreseen
that
,
and
the
matter
has
in
no
wise
gone
on
worse
than
we
expected
;
but
it
will
be
weak
,
yes
,
and
wicked
also
,
to
abandon
the
cause
and
own
ourselves
wrong
,
because
the
inquiry
is
painful
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
only
ourselves
we
have
to
look
to
;
to
a
certain
extent
the
interest
of
the
church
is
in
our
keeping
.
<EOS>
Should
it
be
found
that
one
after
another
of
those
who
hold
preferment
abandoned
it
whenever
it
might
be
attacked
,
<EOS>
is
it
not
plain
that
such
attacks
would
be
renewed
till
nothing
was
left
us
?
<EOS>
and
,
that
if
so
deserted
,
the
Church
of
England
must
fall
to
the
ground
altogether
?
<EOS>
If
this
be
true
of
many
,
it
is
true
of
one
.
<EOS>
Were
you
,
accused
as
you
now
are
,
to
throw
up
the
wardenship
,
and
to
relinquish
the
preferment
which
is
your
property
,
with
the
vain
object
of
proving
yourself
disinterested
,
you
would
fail
in
that
object
,
you
would
inflict
a
desperate
blow
on
your
brother
clergymen
,
you
would
encourage
every
cantankerous
dissenter
in
England
to
make
a
similar
charge
against
some
source
of
clerical
revenue
,
and
you
would
do
your
best
to
dishearten
those
who
are
most
anxious
to
defend
you
and
uphold
your
position
.
<EOS>
I
can
fancy
nothing
more
weak
,
or
more
wrong
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
that
you
think
that
there
is
any
justice
in
these
charges
,
or
that
you
doubt
your
own
right
to
the
wardenship
:
you
are
convinced
of
your
own
honesty
,
and
yet
would
yield
to
them
through
cowardice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cowardice
!
"
said
the
bishop
,
expostulating
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
sat
unmoved
,
gazing
on
his
son
-
in
-
law
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
would
it
not
be
cowardice
?
<EOS>
Would
he
not
do
so
because
he
is
afraid
to
endure
the
evil
things
which
will
be
falsely
spoken
of
him
?
<EOS>
Would
that
not
be
cowardice
?
<EOS>
And
now
let
us
see
the
extent
of
the
evil
which
you
dread
.
<EOS>
The
_
Jupiter
_
publishes
an
article
which
a
great
many
,
no
doubt
,
will
read
;
but
of
those
who
understand
the
subject
how
many
will
believe
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
?
<EOS>
Everyone
knows
what
its
object
is
:
it
has
taken
up
the
case
against
Lord
Guildford
and
against
the
Dean
of
Rochester
,
and
that
against
half
a
dozen
bishops
;
and
does
not
everyone
know
that
it
would
take
up
any
case
of
the
kind
,
right
or
wrong
,
false
or
true
,
with
known
justice
or
known
injustice
,
if
by
doing
so
it
could
further
its
own
views
?
<EOS>
Does
not
all
the
world
know
this
of
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
?
<EOS>
Who
that
really
knows
you
will
think
the
worse
of
you
for
what
_
The
Jupiter
_
says
?
<EOS>
And
why
care
for
those
who
do
not
know
you
?
<EOS>
I
will
say
nothing
of
your
own
comfort
,
but
I
do
say
that
you
could
not
be
justified
in
throwing
up
,
in
a
fit
of
passion
,
for
such
it
would
be
,
the
only
maintenance
that
Eleanor
has
;
and
if
you
did
so
,
if
you
really
did
vacate
the
wardenship
,
and
submit
to
ruin
,
what
would
that
profit
you
?
<EOS>
If
you
have
no
future
right
to
the
income
,
you
have
had
no
past
right
to
it
;
and
the
very
fact
of
your
abandoning
your
position
would
create
a
demand
for
repayment
of
that
which
you
have
already
received
and
spent
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
poor
warden
groaned
as
he
sat
perfectly
still
,
looking
up
at
the
hard
-
hearted
orator
who
thus
tormented
him
,
and
the
bishop
echoed
the
sound
faintly
from
behind
his
hands
;
but
the
archdeacon
cared
little
for
such
signs
of
weakness
,
and
completed
his
exhortation
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
let
us
suppose
the
office
to
be
left
vacant
,
and
that
your
own
troubles
concerning
it
were
over
;
would
that
satisfy
you
?
<EOS>
Are
your
only
aspirations
in
the
matter
confined
to
yourself
and
family
?
<EOS>
I
know
they
are
not
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
are
as
anxious
as
any
of
us
for
the
church
to
which
we
belong
;
and
what
a
grievous
blow
would
such
an
act
of
apostasy
give
her
!
<EOS>
You
owe
it
to
the
church
of
which
you
are
a
member
and
a
minister
,
to
bear
with
this
affliction
,
however
severe
it
may
be
:
you
owe
it
to
my
father
,
who
instituted
you
,
to
support
his
rights
:
you
owe
it
to
those
who
preceded
you
to
assert
the
legality
of
their
position
;
you
owe
it
to
those
who
are
to
come
after
you
,
to
maintain
uninjured
for
them
that
which
you
received
uninjured
from
others
;
and
you
owe
to
us
all
the
unflinching
assistance
of
perfect
brotherhood
in
this
matter
,
so
that
upholding
one
another
we
may
support
our
great
cause
without
blushing
and
without
disgrace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
the
archdeacon
ceased
,
and
stood
self
-
satisfied
,
watching
the
effect
of
his
spoken
wisdom
.
  
<EOS>
The
warden
felt
himself
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
stifled
;
he
would
have
given
the
world
to
get
himself
out
into
the
open
air
without
speaking
to
,
or
noticing
those
who
were
in
the
room
with
him
;
but
this
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
leave
without
saying
something
,
and
he
felt
himself
confounded
by
the
archdeacon
's
eloquence
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
heavy
,
unfeeling
,
unanswerable
truth
in
what
he
had
said
;
there
was
so
much
practical
,
but
odious
common
sense
in
it
,
that
he
neither
knew
how
to
assent
or
to
differ
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
necessary
for
him
to
suffer
,
he
felt
that
he
could
endure
without
complaint
and
without
cowardice
,
providing
that
he
was
self
-
satisfied
of
the
justice
of
his
own
cause
.
<EOS>
What
he
could
not
endure
was
,
that
he
should
be
accused
by
others
,
and
not
acquitted
by
himself
.
<EOS>
Doubting
,
as
he
had
begun
to
doubt
,
the
justice
of
his
own
position
in
the
hospital
,
he
knew
that
his
own
self
-
confidence
would
not
be
restored
because
Mr
Bold
had
been
in
error
as
to
some
legal
form
;
nor
could
he
be
satisfied
to
escape
,
because
,
through
some
legal
fiction
,
he
who
received
the
greatest
benefit
from
the
hospital
might
be
considered
only
as
one
of
its
servants
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
's
speech
had
silenced
him
,
 
stupefied
him
,
 
annihilated
him
;
anything
but
satisfied
him
.
<EOS>
With
the
bishop
it
fared
not
much
better
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
discern
clearly
how
things
were
,
but
he
saw
enough
to
know
that
a
battle
was
to
be
prepared
for
;
a
battle
that
would
destroy
his
few
remaining
comforts
,
and
bring
him
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
.
  
<EOS>
The
warden
still
sat
,
and
still
looked
at
the
archdeacon
,
till
his
thoughts
fixed
themselves
wholly
on
the
means
of
escape
from
his
present
position
,
and
he
felt
like
a
bird
fascinated
by
gazing
on
a
snake
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
agree
with
me
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
at
last
,
breaking
the
dread
silence
<EOS>
;
"
my
lord
,
I
hope
you
agree
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
a
sigh
the
bishop
gave
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
lord
,
I
hope
you
agree
with
me
,
"
again
repeated
the
merciless
tyrant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
suppose
so
,
"
groaned
the
poor
old
man
,
slowly
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
,
warden
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
was
now
stirred
to
action
;
 
he
must
speak
and
move
,
so
he
got
up
and
took
one
turn
before
he
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
press
me
for
an
answer
just
at
present
;
I
will
do
nothing
lightly
in
the
matter
,
and
of
whatever
I
do
I
will
give
you
and
the
bishop
notice
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
without
another
word
he
took
his
leave
,
escaping
quickly
through
the
palace
hall
,
and
down
the
lofty
steps
;
nor
did
he
breathe
freely
till
he
found
himself
alone
under
the
huge
elms
of
the
silent
close
.
<EOS>
Here
he
walked
long
and
slowly
,
thinking
on
his
case
with
a
troubled
air
,
and
trying
in
vain
to
confute
the
archdeacon
's
argument
.
<EOS>
He
then
went
home
,
resolved
to
bear
it
all
,
 
ignominy
,
suspense
,
disgrace
,
self
-
doubt
,
and
heart
-
burning
,
  
and
to
do
as
those
would
have
him
,
who
he
still
believed
were
most
fit
and
most
able
to
counsel
him
aright
.

TRIBULATION
 
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
was
a
sadder
man
than
he
had
ever
yet
been
when
he
returned
to
his
own
house
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
wretched
enough
on
that
well
-
remembered
morning
when
he
was
forced
to
expose
before
his
son
-
in
-
law
<EOS>
the
publisher
's
account
for
ushering
into
the
world
his
dear
book
of
sacred
music
:
when
after
making
such
payments
as
he
could
do
unassisted
,
he
found
that
he
was
a
debtor
of
more
than
three
hundred
pounds
;
but
his
sufferings
then
were
as
nothing
to
his
present
misery
;
 
then
he
had
done
wrong
,
and
he
knew
it
,
and
was
able
to
resolve
that
he
would
not
sin
in
like
manner
again
;
but
now
he
could
make
no
resolution
,
and
comfort
himself
by
no
promises
of
firmness
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
forced
to
think
that
his
lot
had
placed
him
in
a
false
position
,
and
he
was
about
to
maintain
that
position
against
the
opinion
of
the
world
and
against
his
own
convictions
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
read
with
pity
,
amounting
almost
to
horror
,
the
strictures
which
had
appeared
from
time
to
time
against
the
Earl
of
Guildford
as
master
of
St
Cross
,
and
the
invectives
that
had
been
heaped
on
rich
diocesan
dignitaries
and
overgrown
sinecure
pluralists
.
<EOS>
In
judging
of
them
,
he
judged
leniently
;
the
whole
bias
of
his
profession
had
taught
him
to
think
that
they
were
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
,
and
that
the
animosity
with
which
they
had
been
pursued
was
venomous
and
unjust
;
but
he
had
not
the
less
regarded
their
plight
as
most
miserable
.
<EOS>
His
hair
had
stood
on
end
and
his
flesh
had
crept
as
he
read
the
things
which
had
been
written
;
he
had
wondered
how
men
could
live
under
such
a
load
of
disgrace
;
how
they
could
face
their
fellow
-
creatures
while
their
names
were
bandied
about
so
injuriously
and
so
publicly
;
 
and
now
this
lot
was
to
be
his
,
 
he
,
that
shy
,
retiring
man
,
who
had
so
comforted
himself
in
the
hidden
obscurity
of
his
lot
,
who
had
so
enjoyed
the
unassuming
warmth
of
his
own
little
corner
,
 
he
was
now
dragged
forth
into
the
glaring
day
,
and
gibbeted
before
ferocious
multitudes
.
<EOS>
He
entered
his
own
house
a
crestfallen
,
humiliated
man
,
without
a
hope
of
overcoming
the
wretchedness
which
affected
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
wandered
into
the
drawing
-
room
where
was
his
daughter
;
but
he
could
not
speak
to
her
now
,
so
he
left
it
,
and
went
into
the
book
-
room
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
quick
enough
to
escape
Eleanor
's
glance
,
or
to
prevent
her
from
seeing
that
he
was
disturbed
;
and
in
a
little
while
she
followed
him
.
<EOS>
She
found
him
seated
in
his
accustomed
chair
with
no
book
open
before
him
,
no
pen
ready
in
his
hand
,
no
ill
-
shapen
notes
of
blotted
music
lying
before
him
as
was
usual
,
none
of
those
hospital
accounts
with
which
he
was
so
precise
and
yet
so
unmethodical
:
he
was
doing
nothing
,
thinking
of
nothing
,
looking
at
nothing
;
he
was
merely
suffering
.
  
<EOS>
"
Leave
me
,
Eleanor
,
my
dear
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
;
"
leave
me
,
my
darling
,
for
a
few
minutes
,
for
I
am
busy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
saw
well
how
it
was
,
but
she
did
leave
him
,
and
glided
silently
back
to
her
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
sat
a
while
,
thus
alone
and
unoccupied
,
he
got
up
to
walk
again
;
 
he
could
make
more
of
his
thoughts
walking
than
sitting
,
and
was
creeping
out
into
his
garden
,
when
he
met
Bunce
on
the
threshold
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Bunce
,
"
said
he
,
in
a
tone
that
for
him
was
sharp
,
"
what
is
it
?
<EOS>
do
you
want
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
only
coming
to
ask
after
your
reverence
,
"
said
the
old
bedesman
,
touching
his
hat
;
"
and
to
inquire
about
the
news
from
London
,
"
he
added
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
The
warden
winced
,
and
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
felt
bewildered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Attorney
Finney
has
been
there
this
morning
,
"
continued
Bunce
,
"
and
by
his
looks
I
guess
he
is
not
so
well
pleased
as
he
once
was
,
and
it
has
got
abroad
somehow
that
the
archdeacon
has
had
down
great
news
from
London
,
and
Handy
and
Moody
are
both
as
black
as
devils
.
<EOS>
And
I
hope
,
"
said
the
man
,
trying
to
assume
a
cheery
tone
,
"
that
things
are
looking
up
,
and
that
there
'll
be
an
end
soon
to
all
this
stuff
which
bothers
your
reverence
so
sorely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
wish
there
may
be
,
Bunce
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
about
the
news
,
your
reverence
?
"
said
the
old
man
,
almost
whispering
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
walked
on
,
and
shook
his
head
impatiently
.
<EOS>
Poor
Bunce
little
knew
how
he
was
tormenting
his
patron
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
there
was
anything
to
cheer
you
,
I
should
be
so
glad
to
know
it
,
"
said
he
,
with
a
tone
of
affection
which
the
warden
in
all
his
misery
could
not
resist
.
  
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
and
took
both
the
old
man
's
hands
in
his
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
friend
,
"
said
he
,
"
<EOS>
my
dear
old
friend
,
there
is
nothing
;
there
is
no
news
to
cheer
me
;
 
God
's
will
be
done
"
:
and
two
small
hot
tears
broke
away
from
his
eyes
and
stole
down
his
furrowed
cheeks
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
God
's
will
be
done
,
"
said
the
other
solemnly
;
"
but
they
told
me
that
there
was
good
news
from
London
,
and
I
came
to
wish
your
reverence
joy
;
but
God
's
will
be
done
;
"
and
so
the
warden
again
walked
on
,
and
<EOS>
the
bedesman
,
looking
wistfully
after
him
and
receiving
no
encouragement
to
follow
,
returned
sadly
to
his
own
abode
.
  
<EOS>
For
a
couple
of
hours
the
warden
remained
thus
in
the
garden
,
now
walking
,
now
standing
motionless
on
the
turf
,
and
then
,
as
his
legs
got
weary
,
sitting
unconsciously
on
the
garden
seats
,
and
then
walking
again
.
<EOS>
And
Eleanor
,
hidden
behind
the
muslin
curtains
of
the
window
,
watched
him
through
the
trees
as
he
now
came
in
sight
,
and
then
again
was
concealed
by
the
turnings
of
the
walk
;
and
thus
the
time
passed
away
till
five
,
when
the
warden
crept
back
to
the
house
and
prepared
for
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
but
a
sorry
meal
.
<EOS>
The
demure
parlour
-
maid
,
as
she
handed
the
dishes
and
changed
the
plates
,
saw
that
all
was
not
right
,
and
was
more
demure
than
ever
:
neither
father
nor
daughter
could
eat
,
and
the
hateful
food
was
soon
cleared
away
,
and
the
bottle
of
port
placed
upon
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
like
Bunce
to
come
in
,
papa
?
"
said
Eleanor
,
thinking
that
the
company
of
the
old
man
might
lighten
his
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
,
thank
you
,
not
to
-
day
;
but
are
not
you
going
out
,
Eleanor
,
this
lovely
afternoon
?
<EOS>
do
n't
stay
in
for
me
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
seemed
so
sad
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sad
,
"
said
he
,
irritated
;
"
well
,
people
must
all
have
their
share
of
sadness
here
;
I
am
not
more
exempt
than
another
:
but
kiss
me
,
dearest
,
and
go
now
;
I
will
,
if
possible
,
be
more
sociable
when
you
return
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
Eleanor
was
again
banished
from
her
father
's
sorrow
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
her
desire
now
was
not
to
find
him
happy
,
but
to
be
allowed
to
share
his
sorrows
;
not
to
force
him
to
be
sociable
,
but
to
persuade
him
to
be
trustful
.
  
<EOS>
She
put
on
her
bonnet
as
desired
,
and
went
up
to
Mary
Bold
;
this
was
now
her
daily
haunt
,
for
John
Bold
was
up
in
London
among
lawyers
and
church
reformers
,
diving
deep
into
other
questions
than
that
of
the
wardenship
of
Barchester
;
supplying
information
to
one
member
of
Parliament
,
and
dining
with
another
;
subscribing
to
funds
for
the
abolition
of
clerical
incomes
,
and
seconding
at
that
great
national
meeting
at
the
Crown
and
Anchor
a
resolution
to
the
effect
,
that
no
clergyman
of
the
Church
of
England
,
be
he
who
he
might
,
should
have
more
than
a
thousand
a
year
,
and
none
less
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
.
<EOS>
His
speech
on
this
occasion
was
short
,
for
fifteen
had
to
speak
,
and
the
room
was
hired
for
two
hours
only
,
at
the
expiration
of
which
the
Quakers
and
Mr
Cobden
were
to
make
use
of
it
for
an
appeal
to
the
public
in
aid
of
the
Emperor
of
Russia
;
but
it
was
sharp
and
effective
;
at
least
he
was
told
so
by
a
companion
with
whom
he
now
lived
much
,
and
on
whom
he
greatly
depended
,
 
one
Tom
Towers
,
a
very
leading
genius
,
and
supposed
to
have
high
employment
on
the
staff
of
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
.
  
<EOS>
So
Eleanor
,
as
was
now
her
wo
nt
,
went
up
to
Mary
Bold
,
and
Mary
listened
kindly
,
while
the
daughter
spoke
much
of
her
father
,
and
,
perhaps
kinder
still
,
found
a
listener
in
Eleanor
,
while
she
spoke
about
her
brother
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
the
warden
sat
alone
,
leaning
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
;
he
had
poured
out
a
glass
of
wine
,
but
had
done
so
merely
from
habit
,
for
he
left
it
untouched
;
there
he
sat
gazing
at
the
open
window
,
and
thinking
,
if
he
can
be
said
to
have
thought
,
of
the
happiness
of
his
past
life
.
<EOS>
All
manner
of
past
delights
came
before
his
mind
,
which
at
the
time
he
had
enjoyed
without
considering
them
;
his
easy
days
,
his
absence
of
all
kind
of
hard
work
,
his
pleasant
shady
home
,
those
twelve
old
neighbours
whose
welfare
till
now
had
been
the
source
of
so
much
pleasant
care
,
the
excellence
of
his
children
,
the
friendship
of
the
dear
old
bishop
,
the
solemn
grandeur
of
those
vaulted
aisles
,
through
which
he
loved
to
hear
his
own
voice
pealing
;
and
then
that
friend
of
friends
,
that
choice
ally
that
had
never
deserted
him
,
that
eloquent
companion
that
would
always
,
when
asked
,
discourse
such
pleasant
music
,
that
violoncello
of
his
;
 
ah
,
how
happy
he
had
been
!
<EOS>
but
it
was
over
now
;
his
easy
days
and
absence
of
work
had
been
the
crime
which
brought
on
him
his
tribulation
;
his
shady
home
was
pleasant
no
longer
;
maybe
it
was
no
longer
his
;
the
old
neighbours
,
whose
welfare
had
been
so
desired
by
him
,
were
his
enemies
;
his
daughter
was
as
wretched
as
himself
;
and
even
the
bishop
was
made
miserable
by
his
position
.
<EOS>
He
could
never
again
lift
up
his
voice
boldly
as
he
had
hitherto
done
among
his
brethren
,
for
he
felt
that
he
was
disgraced
;
and
he
feared
even
to
touch
his
bow
,
for
he
knew
how
grievous
a
sound
of
wailing
,
how
piteous
a
lamentation
,
it
would
produce
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
still
sitting
in
the
same
chair
and
the
same
posture
,
having
hardly
moved
a
limb
for
two
hours
,
when
Eleanor
came
back
to
tea
,
and
succeeded
in
bringing
him
with
her
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
tea
seemed
as
comfortless
as
the
dinner
,
though
the
warden
,
who
had
hitherto
eaten
nothing
all
day
,
devoured
the
plateful
of
bread
and
butter
,
unconscious
of
what
he
was
doing
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
had
made
up
her
mind
to
force
him
to
talk
to
her
,
but
she
hardly
knew
how
to
commence
:
she
must
wait
till
the
urn
was
gone
,
till
the
servant
would
no
longer
be
coming
in
and
out
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
everything
was
gone
,
and
the
drawing
-
room
door
was
permanently
closed
;
then
Eleanor
,
getting
up
and
going
round
to
her
father
,
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
,
and
said
,
"
Papa
,
wo
n't
you
tell
me
what
it
is
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
what
is
,
my
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
new
sorrow
that
torments
you
;
I
know
you
are
unhappy
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
New
sorrow
!
<EOS>
it
's
no
new
sorrow
,
my
dear
;
we
have
all
our
cares
sometimes
;
"
and
he
tried
to
smile
,
but
it
was
a
ghastly
failure
;
"
but
I
should
n't
be
so
dull
a
companion
;
come
,
we
'll
have
some
music
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
papa
,
not
tonight
,
 
it
would
only
trouble
you
tonight
;
"
and
she
sat
upon
his
knee
,
as
she
sometimes
would
in
their
gayest
moods
,
and
with
her
arm
round
his
neck
,
she
said
:
"
Papa
,
I
will
not
leave
you
till
you
talk
to
me
;
oh
,
if
you
only
knew
how
much
good
it
would
do
to
you
,
to
tell
me
of
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
father
kissed
his
daughter
,
and
pressed
her
to
his
heart
;
but
still
he
said
nothing
:
it
was
so
hard
to
him
to
speak
of
his
own
sorrows
;
he
was
so
shy
a
man
even
with
his
own
child
!
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
papa
,
do
tell
me
what
it
is
<EOS>
;
I
know
it
is
about
the
hospital
,
and
what
they
are
doing
up
in
London
,
and
what
that
cruel
newspaper
has
said
;
but
if
there
be
such
cause
for
sorrow
,
let
us
be
sorrowful
together
;
we
are
all
in
all
to
each
other
now
:
<EOS>
dear
,
dear
papa
,
do
speak
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
could
not
well
speak
now
,
for
the
warm
tears
were
running
down
his
cheeks
like
rain
in
May
,
but
he
held
his
child
close
to
his
heart
,
and
squeezed
her
hand
as
a
lover
might
,
and
she
kissed
his
forehead
and
his
wet
cheeks
,
and
lay
upon
his
bosom
,
and
comforted
him
as
a
woman
only
can
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
own
child
,
"
he
said
,
as
soon
as
his
tears
would
let
him
speak
,
"
my
own
,
own
child
,
why
should
you
too
be
unhappy
before
it
is
necessary
?
<EOS>
It
may
come
to
that
,
that
we
must
leave
this
place
,
but
till
that
time
comes
,
why
should
your
young
days
be
clouded
?
"
  
"
And
is
that
all
,
papa
?
<EOS>
If
that
be
all
,
let
us
leave
it
,
and
have
light
hearts
elsewhere
:
if
that
be
all
,
let
us
go
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
papa
,
you
and
I
could
be
happy
if
we
had
only
bread
to
eat
,
so
long
as
our
hearts
were
light
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
Eleanor
's
face
was
lighted
up
with
enthusiasm
as
she
told
her
father
how
he
might
banish
all
his
care
;
and
a
gleam
of
joy
shot
across
his
brow
as
this
idea
of
escape
again
presented
itself
,
and
he
again
fancied
for
a
moment
that
he
could
spurn
away
from
him
the
income
which
the
world
envied
him
;
that
he
could
give
the
lie
to
that
wielder
of
the
tomahawk
who
had
dared
to
write
such
things
of
him
in
_
The
Jupiter
_
;
that
he
could
leave
Sir
Abraham
,
and
the
archdeacon
,
and
Bold
,
and
the
rest
of
them
with
their
lawsuit
among
them
,
and
wipe
his
hands
altogether
of
so
sorrow
-
stirring
a
concern
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
what
happiness
might
there
be
in
the
distance
,
with
Eleanor
and
him
in
some
small
cottage
,
and
nothing
left
of
their
former
grandeur
but
their
music
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
they
would
walk
forth
with
their
music
books
,
and
their
instruments
,
and
shaking
the
dust
from
off
their
feet
as
they
went
,
leave
the
ungrateful
place
.
<EOS>
Never
did
a
poor
clergyman
sigh
for
a
warm
benefice
more
anxiously
than
our
warden
<EOS>
did
now
to
be
rid
of
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
it
up
,
papa
,
"
she
said
again
,
jumping
from
his
knees
and
standing
on
her
feet
before
him
,
looking
boldly
into
his
face
;
"
give
it
up
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
it
was
sad
to
see
how
that
momentary
gleam
of
joy
passed
away
;
how
the
look
of
hope
was
dispersed
from
that
sorrowful
face
,
as
the
remembrance
of
the
archdeacon
came
back
upon
our
poor
warden
,
and
he
reflected
that
he
could
not
stir
from
his
now
hated
post
.
<EOS>
He
was
as
a
man
bound
with
iron
,
fettered
with
adamant
<EOS>
:
he
was
in
no
respect
a
free
agent
;
he
had
no
choice
.
"
<EOS>
Give
it
up
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
if
he
only
could
:
what
an
easy
way
that
were
out
of
all
his
troubles
!
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
do
n't
doubt
about
it
,
"
she
continued
,
thinking
that
his
hesitation
arose
from
his
unwillingness
to
abandon
so
comfortable
a
home
;
"
is
it
on
my
account
that
you
would
stay
here
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
that
I
can
not
be
happy
without
a
pony
-
carriage
and
a
fine
drawing
-
room
?
<EOS>
Papa
,
I
never
can
be
happy
here
,
as
long
as
there
is
a
question
as
to
your
honour
in
staying
here
;
but
I
could
be
gay
as
the
day
is
long
in
the
smallest
tiny
little
cottage
,
if
I
could
see
you
come
in
and
go
out
with
a
light
heart
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
papa
,
your
face
tells
so
much
;
though
you
wo
n't
speak
to
me
with
your
voice
,
I
know
how
it
is
with
you
every
time
I
look
at
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
How
he
pressed
her
to
his
heart
again
with
almost
a
spasmodic
pressure
!
<EOS>
How
he
kissed
her
as
the
tears
fell
like
rain
from
his
old
eyes
!
<EOS>
How
he
blessed
her
,
and
called
her
by
a
hundred
soft
sweet
names
which
now
came
new
to
his
lips
!
<EOS>
How
he
chid
himself
for
ever
having
been
unhappy
with
such
a
treasure
in
his
house
,
such
a
jewel
on
his
bosom
,
with
so
sweet
a
flower
in
the
choice
garden
of
his
heart
!
<EOS>
And
then
the
floodgates
of
his
tongue
were
loosed
,
and
,
at
length
,
with
unsparing
detail
of
circumstances
,
he
told
her
all
that
he
wished
,
and
all
that
he
could
not
do
.
<EOS>
He
repeated
those
arguments
of
the
archdeacon
,
not
agreeing
in
their
truth
,
but
explaining
his
inability
to
escape
from
them
;
 
how
it
had
been
declared
to
him
that
he
was
bound
to
remain
where
he
was
by
the
interests
of
his
order
,
by
gratitude
to
the
bishop
,
by
the
wishes
of
his
friends
,
by
a
sense
of
duty
,
which
,
though
he
could
not
understand
it
,
he
was
fain
to
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
He
told
her
how
he
had
been
accused
of
cowardice
,
and
though
he
was
not
a
man
to
make
much
of
such
a
charge
before
the
world
,
now
in
the
full
candour
of
his
heart
he
explained
to
her
that
such
an
accusation
was
grievous
to
him
;
that
he
did
think
it
would
be
unmanly
to
desert
his
post
,
merely
to
escape
his
present
sufferings
,
and
that
,
therefore
,
he
must
bear
as
best
he
might
the
misery
which
was
prepared
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
And
did
she
find
these
details
tedious
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
;
she
encouraged
him
to
dilate
on
every
feeling
he
expressed
,
till
he
laid
bare
the
inmost
corners
of
his
heart
to
her
.
<EOS>
They
spoke
together
of
the
archdeacon
,
as
two
children
might
of
a
stern
,
unpopular
,
but
still
respected
schoolmaster
,
and
of
the
bishop
as
a
parent
kind
as
kind
could
be
,
but
powerless
against
an
omnipotent
pedagogue
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
when
they
had
discussed
all
this
,
when
the
father
had
told
all
to
the
child
,
she
could
not
be
less
confiding
than
he
had
been
;
and
as
John
Bold
's
name
was
mentioned
between
them
,
she
owned
how
well
she
had
learned
to
love
him
<EOS>
,
 
"
had
loved
him
once
,
"
she
said
,
"
<EOS>
but
she
would
not
,
could
not
do
so
now
 
no
,
even
had
her
troth
been
plighted
to
him
<EOS>
,
she
would
have
taken
it
back
again
;
 
had
she
sworn
to
love
him
as
his
wife
,
she
would
have
discarded
him
,
and
not
felt
herself
forsworn
,
when
he
proved
himself
the
enemy
of
her
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
warden
declared
that
Bold
was
no
enemy
of
his
,
and
encouraged
her
love
;
and
gently
rebuked
,
as
he
kissed
her
,
the
stern
resolve
she
had
made
to
cast
him
off
;
and
then
he
spoke
to
her
of
happier
days
when
their
trials
would
all
be
over
;
and
declared
that
her
young
heart
should
not
be
torn
asunder
to
please
either
priest
or
prelate
,
dean
or
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
No
,
not
if
all
Oxford
were
to
convocate
together
,
and
agree
as
to
the
necessity
of
the
sacrifice
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
they
greatly
comforted
each
other
;
 
and
in
what
sorrow
will
not
such
mutual
confidence
give
consolation
!
 
<EOS>
and
with
a
last
expression
of
tender
love
they
parted
,
and
went
comparatively
happy
to
their
rooms
.
   
<EOS>
IPHIGENIA
 
<EOS>
When
Eleanor
laid
her
head
on
her
pillow
that
night
,
her
mind
was
anxiously
intent
on
some
plan
by
which
she
might
extricate
her
father
from
his
misery
;
and
,
in
her
warm
-
hearted
enthusiasm
,
self
-
sacrifice
was
decided
on
as
the
means
to
be
adopted
.
<EOS>
Was
not
so
good
an
Agamemnon
worthy
of
an
Iphigenia
?
<EOS>
She
would
herself
personally
implore
John
Bold
to
desist
from
his
undertaking
;
she
would
explain
to
him
her
father
's
sorrows
,
the
cruel
misery
of
his
position
;
she
would
tell
him
how
her
father
would
die
if
he
were
thus
dragged
before
the
public
and
exposed
to
such
unmerited
ignominy
;
she
would
appeal
to
his
old
friendship
,
to
his
generosity
,
to
his
manliness
,
to
his
mercy
;
if
need
were
,
she
would
kneel
to
him
for
the
favour
she
would
ask
;
but
before
she
did
this
the
idea
of
love
must
be
banished
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
no
bargain
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
To
his
mercy
,
to
his
generosity
,
she
could
appeal
;
but
as
a
pure
maiden
,
hitherto
even
unsolicited
,
she
could
not
appeal
to
his
love
,
nor
under
such
circumstances
could
she
allow
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
when
so
provoked
he
would
declare
his
passion
;
that
was
to
be
expected
;
there
had
been
enough
between
them
to
make
such
a
fact
sure
;
but
it
was
equally
certain
that
he
must
be
rejected
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
be
understood
as
saying
,
Make
my
father
free
<EOS>
and
I
am
the
reward
.
<EOS>
There
would
be
no
sacrifice
in
that
;
 
not
so
had
Jephthah
's
daughter
saved
her
father
;
 
not
so
could
she
show
to
that
kindest
,
dearest
of
parents
<EOS>
how
much
she
was
able
to
bear
for
his
good
.
<EOS>
No
;
to
one
resolve
must
her
whole
soul
be
bound
;
and
so
resolving
<EOS>
,
she
felt
that
she
could
make
her
great
request
to
Bold
with
as
much
self
-
assured
confidence
as
she
could
have
done
to
his
grandfather
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
I
own
<EOS>
I
have
fears
for
my
heroine
;
not
as
to
the
upshot
of
her
mission
,
 
not
in
the
least
as
to
that
;
as
to
the
full
success
of
her
generous
scheme
,
and
the
ultimate
result
of
such
a
project
,
no
one
conversant
with
human
nature
and
novels
can
have
a
doubt
;
but
as
to
the
amount
of
sympathy
she
may
receive
from
those
of
her
own
sex
.
<EOS>
Girls
below
twenty
and
old
ladies
above
sixty
will
do
her
justice
;
for
in
the
female
heart
the
soft
springs
of
sweet
romance
reopen
after
many
years
,
and
again
gush
out
with
waters
pure
as
in
earlier
days
,
and
greatly
refresh
the
path
that
leads
downwards
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
But
I
fear
that
the
majority
of
those
between
these
two
eras
will
not
approve
of
Eleanor
's
plan
.
<EOS>
I
fear
that
unmarried
ladies
of
thirty
-
five
will
declare
that
there
can
be
no
probability
of
so
absurd
a
project
being
carried
through
;
that
young
women
on
their
knees
before
their
lovers
are
sure
to
get
kissed
,
and
that
they
would
not
put
themselves
in
such
a
position
<EOS>
did
they
not
expect
it
;
that
Eleanor
is
going
to
Bold
only
because
circumstances
prevent
Bold
from
coming
to
her
;
that
she
is
certainly
a
little
fool
,
or
a
little
schemer
,
but
that
in
all
probability
she
is
thinking
a
good
deal
more
about
herself
than
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
Dear
ladies
,
you
are
right
as
to
your
appreciation
of
the
circumstances
,
but
very
wrong
as
to
Miss
Harding
's
character
.
<EOS>
Miss
Harding
was
much
younger
than
you
are
,
and
could
not
,
therefore
,
know
,
as
you
may
do
,
to
what
dangers
such
an
encounter
might
expose
her
.
<EOS>
She
may
get
kissed
;
I
think
it
very
probable
that
she
will
;
but
I
give
my
solemn
word
and
positive
assurance
,
that
the
remotest
idea
of
such
a
catastrophe
never
occurred
to
her
as
she
made
the
great
resolve
now
alluded
to
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
she
slept
;
and
then
she
rose
refreshed
;
and
met
her
father
with
her
kindest
embrace
and
most
loving
smiles
;
and
on
the
whole
their
breakfast
was
by
no
means
so
triste
as
had
been
their
dinner
the
day
before
;
and
then
,
making
some
excuse
to
her
father
for
so
soon
leaving
him
,
she
started
on
the
commencement
of
her
operations
.
  
<EOS>
She
knew
that
John
Bold
was
in
London
,
and
that
,
therefore
,
the
scene
itself
could
not
be
enacted
to
-
day
;
but
she
also
knew
that
he
was
soon
to
be
home
,
probably
on
the
next
day
,
and
it
was
necessary
that
some
little
plan
for
meeting
him
should
be
concerted
with
his
sister
Mary
.
<EOS>
When
she
got
up
to
the
house
,
she
went
,
as
usual
,
into
the
morning
sitting
-
room
,
and
was
startled
by
perceiving
,
by
a
stick
,
a
greatcoat
,
and
sundry
parcels
which
were
lying
about
,
that
Bold
must
already
have
returned
.
  
<EOS>
"
John
has
come
back
so
suddenly
,
"
said
Mary
,
coming
into
the
room
;
"
he
has
been
travelling
all
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
come
up
again
some
other
time
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
about
to
beat
a
retreat
in
her
sudden
dismay
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
out
now
,
and
will
be
for
the
next
two
hours
,
"
said
the
other
;
"
he
's
with
that
horrid
Finney
;
he
only
came
to
see
him
,
and
he
returns
by
the
mail
train
tonight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Returns
by
the
mail
train
tonight
,
thought
Eleanor
to
herself
,
as
she
strove
to
screw
up
her
courage
;
 
away
again
tonight
;
 
then
it
must
be
now
or
never
;
and
she
again
sat
down
,
having
risen
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
She
wished
the
ordeal
could
have
been
postponed
:
she
had
fully
made
up
her
mind
to
do
the
deed
,
but
she
had
not
made
up
her
mind
to
do
it
this
very
day
;
and
now
she
felt
ill
at
ease
,
astray
,
and
in
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
"
she
began
,
"
I
must
see
your
brother
before
he
goes
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
of
course
,
"
said
the
other
;
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
'll
be
delighted
to
see
you
;
"
and
she
tried
to
treat
it
as
a
matter
of
course
,
but
she
was
not
the
less
surprised
;
for
Mary
and
Eleanor
had
daily
talked
over
John
Bold
and
his
conduct
,
and
his
love
,
and
Mary
would
insist
on
calling
Eleanor
her
sister
,
and
would
scold
her
for
not
calling
Bold
by
his
Christian
name
;
and
Eleanor
would
half
confess
her
love
,
but
like
a
modest
maiden
would
protest
against
such
familiarities
even
with
the
name
of
her
lover
;
and
so
they
talked
hour
after
hour
,
and
Mary
Bold
,
who
was
much
the
elder
,
looked
forward
with
happy
confidence
to
the
day
when
Eleanor
would
not
be
ashamed
to
call
her
her
sister
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
however
,
fully
sure
that
just
at
present
Eleanor
would
be
much
more
likely
to
avoid
her
brother
than
to
seek
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
I
must
see
your
brother
,
now
,
to
-
day
,
and
beg
from
him
a
great
favour
;
"
and
she
spoke
with
a
solemn
air
,
not
at
all
usual
to
her
;
and
then
she
went
on
,
and
opened
to
her
friend
all
her
plan
,
her
well
-
weighed
scheme
for
saving
her
father
from
a
sorrow
which
would
,
she
said
,
if
it
lasted
,
bring
him
to
his
grave
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
Mary
,
"
she
continued
,
<EOS>
"
you
must
now
,
you
know
,
cease
any
joking
about
me
and
Mr
Bold
;
you
must
now
say
no
more
about
that
;
I
am
not
ashamed
to
beg
this
favour
from
your
brother
,
but
when
I
have
done
so
,
there
can
never
be
anything
further
between
us
;
"
and
this
she
said
with
a
staid
and
solemn
air
,
quite
worthy
of
Jephthah
's
daughter
or
of
Iphigenia
either
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
quite
clear
that
Mary
Bold
did
not
follow
the
argument
.
<EOS>
That
Eleanor
Harding
should
appeal
,
on
behalf
of
her
father
,
to
Bold
's
better
feelings
seemed
to
Mary
quite
natural
;
it
seemed
quite
natural
that
he
should
relent
,
overcome
by
such
filial
tears
,
and
by
so
much
beauty
;
but
,
to
her
thinking
,
it
was
at
any
rate
equally
natural
,
that
having
relented
,
John
should
put
his
arm
round
his
mistress
's
waist
,
and
say
:
"
Now
having
settled
that
,
let
us
be
man
and
wife
,
and
all
will
end
happily
!
"
<EOS>
Why
his
good
nature
should
not
be
rewarded
,
when
such
reward
would
operate
to
the
disadvantage
of
none
,
Mary
,
who
had
more
sense
than
romance
,
could
not
understand
;
and
she
said
as
much
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
however
,
was
firm
,
and
made
quite
an
eloquent
speech
to
support
her
own
view
of
the
question
:
she
could
not
condescend
,
she
said
,
to
ask
such
a
favour
on
any
other
terms
than
those
proposed
.
<EOS>
Mary
might
,
perhaps
,
think
her
high
-
flown
,
but
she
had
her
own
ideas
,
and
she
could
not
submit
to
sacrifice
her
self
-
respect
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
sure
you
love
him
;
 
do
n't
you
?
"
pleaded
Mary
;
"
and
I
am
sure
he
loves
you
better
than
anything
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
was
going
to
make
another
speech
,
but
a
tear
came
to
each
eye
,
and
she
could
not
;
so
she
pretended
to
blow
her
nose
,
and
walked
to
the
window
,
and
made
a
little
inward
call
on
her
own
courage
,
and
finding
herself
somewhat
sustained
,
said
sententiously
:
"
Mary
,
this
is
nonsense
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
love
him
,
"
said
Mary
,
who
had
followed
her
friend
to
the
window
,
and
now
spoke
with
her
arms
close
wound
round
the
other
's
waist
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
love
him
with
all
your
heart
,
 
you
know
you
do
;
I
defy
you
to
deny
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
 
"
commenced
Eleanor
,
turning
sharply
round
to
refute
the
charge
;
but
the
intended
falsehood
stuck
in
her
throat
,
and
never
came
to
utterance
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
deny
her
love
,
so
she
took
plentifully
to
tears
,
and
leant
upon
her
friend
's
bosom
and
sobbed
there
,
and
protested
that
,
love
or
no
love
,
it
would
make
no
difference
in
her
resolve
,
and
called
Mary
,
a
thousand
times
,
the
most
cruel
of
girls
,
and
swore
her
to
secrecy
by
a
hundred
oaths
,
and
ended
by
declaring
that
the
girl
who
could
betray
her
friend
's
love
,
even
to
a
brother
,
would
be
as
black
a
traitor
as
a
soldier
in
a
garrison
who
should
open
the
city
gates
to
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
While
they
were
yet
discussing
the
matter
,
Bold
returned
,
and
Eleanor
was
forced
into
sudden
action
:
she
had
either
to
accomplish
or
abandon
her
plan
;
and
having
slipped
into
her
friend
's
bedroom
,
as
the
gentleman
closed
the
hall
door
,
she
washed
the
marks
of
tears
from
her
eyes
,
and
resolved
within
herself
to
go
through
with
it
.
"
<EOS>
Tell
him
I
am
here
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
coming
in
;
and
mind
,
whatever
you
do
,
do
n't
leave
us
.
"
<EOS>
So
Mary
informed
her
brother
,
with
a
somewhat
sombre
air
,
that
Miss
Harding
was
in
the
next
room
,
and
was
coming
to
speak
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
was
certainly
thinking
more
of
her
father
than
herself
,
as
she
arranged
her
hair
before
the
glass
,
and
removed
the
traces
of
sorrow
from
her
face
;
and
yet
I
should
be
untrue
if
I
said
that
she
was
not
anxious
to
appear
well
before
her
lover
<EOS>
:
why
else
was
she
so
sedulous
with
that
stubborn
curl
that
would
rebel
against
her
hand
,
and
smooth
so
eagerly
her
ruffled
ribands
?
<EOS>
why
else
did
she
damp
her
eyes
to
dispel
the
redness
,
and
bite
her
pretty
lips
to
bring
back
the
colour
?
<EOS>
Of
course
she
was
anxious
to
look
her
best
,
for
she
was
but
a
mortal
angel
after
all
.
<EOS>
But
had
she
been
immortal
,
had
she
flitted
back
to
the
sitting
-
room
on
a
cherub
's
wings
,
she
could
not
have
had
a
more
faithful
heart
,
or
a
truer
wish
to
save
her
father
at
any
cost
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
John
Bold
had
not
met
her
since
the
day
when
she
left
him
in
dudgeon
in
the
cathedral
close
.
<EOS>
Since
then
his
whole
time
had
been
occupied
in
promoting
the
cause
against
her
father
,
and
not
unsuccessfully
.
<EOS>
He
had
often
thought
of
her
,
and
turned
over
in
his
mind
a
hundred
schemes
for
showing
her
how
disinterested
was
his
love
.
<EOS>
He
would
write
to
her
and
beseech
her
not
to
allow
the
performance
of
a
public
duty
to
injure
him
in
her
estimation
;
he
would
write
to
Mr
Harding
,
explain
all
his
views
,
and
boldly
claim
the
warden
's
daughter
,
urging
that
the
untoward
circumstances
between
them
need
be
no
bar
to
their
ancient
friendship
,
or
to
a
closer
tie
;
he
would
throw
himself
on
his
knees
before
his
mistress
;
he
would
wait
and
marry
the
daughter
when
the
father
has
lost
his
home
and
his
income
;
he
would
give
up
the
lawsuit
and
go
to
Australia
,
with
her
of
course
,
leaving
_
The
Jupiter
_
and
Mr
Finney
to
complete
the
case
between
them
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
as
he
woke
in
the
morning
fevered
and
impatient
,
he
would
blow
out
his
brains
and
have
done
with
all
his
cares
;
 
but
this
idea
was
generally
consequent
on
an
imprudent
supper
enjoyed
in
company
with
Tom
Towers
.
  
<EOS>
How
beautiful
Eleanor
appeared
to
him
as
she
slowly
walked
into
the
room
!
<EOS>
Not
for
nothing
had
all
those
little
cares
been
taken
.
<EOS>
Though
her
sister
,
the
archdeacon
's
wife
,
had
spoken
slightingly
of
her
charms
,
Eleanor
was
very
beautiful
when
seen
aright
.
<EOS>
Hers
was
not
of
those
impassive
faces
,
which
have
the
beauty
of
a
marble
bust
;
finely
chiselled
features
,
perfect
in
every
line
,
true
to
the
rules
of
symmetry
,
as
lovely
to
a
stranger
as
to
a
friend
,
unvarying
unless
in
sickness
,
or
as
age
affects
them
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
startling
brilliancy
of
beauty
,
no
pearly
whiteness
,
no
radiant
carnation
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
the
majestic
contour
that
rivets
attention
,
demands
instant
wonder
,
and
then
disappoints
by
the
coldness
of
its
charms
.
<EOS>
You
might
pass
Eleanor
Harding
in
the
street
without
notice
,
but
you
could
hardly
pass
an
evening
with
her
and
not
lose
your
heart
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
never
appeared
more
lovely
to
her
lover
than
she
now
did
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
animated
though
it
was
serious
,
and
her
full
dark
lustrous
eyes
shone
with
anxious
energy
;
her
hand
trembled
as
she
took
his
,
and
she
could
hardly
pronounce
his
name
,
when
she
addressed
him
.
<EOS>
Bold
wished
with
all
his
heart
that
the
Australian
scheme
was
in
the
act
of
realisation
,
and
that
he
and
Eleanor
were
away
together
,
never
to
hear
further
of
the
lawsuit
.
  
<EOS>
He
began
to
talk
,
asked
after
her
health
,
 
said
something
about
London
being
very
stupid
,
and
more
about
Barchester
being
very
pleasant
;
declared
the
weather
to
be
very
hot
,
and
then
inquired
after
Mr
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
is
not
very
well
,
"
said
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
John
Bold
was
very
sorry
,
 
so
sorry
:
<EOS>
he
hoped
it
was
nothing
serious
,
and
put
on
the
unmeaningly
solemn
face
which
people
usually
use
on
such
occasions
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
especially
want
to
speak
to
you
about
my
father
,
Mr
Bold
;
indeed
,
I
am
now
here
on
purpose
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Papa
is
very
unhappy
,
very
unhappy
indeed
,
about
this
affair
of
the
hospital
:
you
would
pity
him
,
Mr
Bold
,
if
you
could
see
how
wretched
it
has
made
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Miss
Harding
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
you
would
;
 
anyone
would
pity
him
;
but
a
friend
,
an
old
friend
as
you
are
,
 
indeed
you
would
.
<EOS>
He
is
an
altered
man
;
his
cheerfulness
has
all
gone
,
and
his
sweet
temper
,
and
his
kind
happy
tone
of
voice
;
you
would
hardly
know
him
if
you
saw
him
,
Mr
Bold
,
he
is
so
much
altered
;
and
 
and
 
if
this
goes
on
,
he
will
die
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
Eleanor
had
recourse
to
her
handkerchief
,
and
so
also
had
her
auditors
;
but
she
plucked
up
her
courage
,
and
went
on
with
her
tale
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
break
his
heart
,
and
die
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
Mr
Bold
,
it
was
not
you
who
wrote
those
cruel
things
in
the
newspaper
 
"
  
<EOS>
John
Bold
eagerly
protested
that
it
was
not
,
but
his
heart
smote
him
as
to
his
intimate
alliance
with
Tom
Towers
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
am
sure
it
was
not
;
and
papa
has
not
for
a
moment
thought
so
;
you
would
not
be
so
cruel
;
 
but
it
has
nearly
killed
him
.
<EOS>
Papa
can
not
bear
to
think
that
people
should
so
speak
of
him
,
and
that
everybody
should
hear
him
so
spoken
of
:
 
they
have
called
him
avaricious
,
and
dishonest
,
and
they
say
he
is
robbing
the
old
men
,
and
taking
the
money
of
the
hospital
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
said
so
,
Miss
Harding
.
<EOS>
I
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
"
continued
Eleanor
,
interrupting
him
,
for
she
was
now
in
the
full
flood
-
tide
of
her
eloquence
;
"
no
,
I
am
sure
you
have
not
;
but
others
have
said
so
;
and
if
this
goes
on
,
if
such
things
are
written
again
,
it
will
kill
papa
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mr
Bold
,
if
you
only
knew
the
state
he
is
in
!
<EOS>
Now
papa
does
not
care
much
about
money
.
"
  
<EOS>
Both
her
auditors
,
brother
and
sister
,
assented
to
this
,
and
declared
on
their
own
knowledge
that
no
man
lived
less
addicted
to
filthy
lucre
than
the
warden
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
's
<EOS>
so
kind
of
you
to
say
so
,
Mary
,
and
of
you
too
,
<EOS>
Mr
Bold
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
bear
that
people
should
think
unjustly
of
papa
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
he
would
give
up
the
hospital
altogether
,
only
he
can
not
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
says
it
would
be
cowardly
,
and
that
he
would
be
deserting
his
order
,
and
injuring
the
church
.
<EOS>
Whatever
may
happen
,
papa
will
not
do
that
:
he
would
leave
the
place
to
-
morrow
willingly
,
and
give
up
his
house
,
and
the
income
and
all
,
if
the
archdeacon
 
"
  
Eleanor
was
going
to
say
"
would
let
him
,
"
but
she
stopped
herself
before
she
had
compromised
her
father
's
dignity
;
and
giving
a
long
sigh
,
she
added
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
so
wish
he
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
one
who
knows
Mr
Harding
personally
accuses
him
for
a
moment
,
"
said
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
he
that
has
to
bear
the
punishment
;
it
is
he
that
suffers
,
"
said
Eleanor
;
"
and
what
for
?
<EOS>
what
has
he
done
wrong
?
<EOS>
how
has
he
deserved
this
persecution
?
<EOS>
he
that
never
had
an
unkind
thought
in
his
life
<EOS>
,
he
that
never
said
an
unkind
word
!
"
<EOS>
and
here
she
broke
down
,
and
the
violence
of
her
sobs
stopped
her
utterance
.
  
<EOS>
Bold
,
for
the
fifth
or
sixth
time
,
declared
that
neither
he
nor
any
of
his
friends
imputed
any
blame
personally
to
Mr
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
should
he
be
persecuted
?
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Eleanor
through
her
tears
,
forgetting
in
her
eagerness
that
her
intention
had
been
to
humble
herself
as
a
suppliant
before
John
Bold
;
 
<EOS>
"
why
should
he
be
singled
out
for
scorn
and
disgrace
?
<EOS>
why
should
he
be
made
so
wretched
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mr
Bold
,
"
 
and
she
turned
towards
him
as
though
the
kneeling
scene
were
about
to
be
commenced
,
 
"
oh
!
<EOS>
Mr
Bold
,
why
did
you
begin
all
this
?
<EOS>
You
,
whom
we
all
<EOS>
so
 
so
 
valued
!
"
  
<EOS>
To
speak
the
truth
,
the
reformer
's
punishment
was
certainly
come
upon
him
,
for
his
present
plight
was
not
enviable
;
he
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
excuse
himself
by
platitudes
about
public
duty
,
which
it
is
by
no
means
worth
while
to
repeat
,
and
to
reiterate
his
eulogy
on
Mr
Harding
's
character
.
<EOS>
His
position
was
certainly
a
cruel
one
:
had
any
gentleman
called
upon
him
on
behalf
of
Mr
Harding
he
could
of
course
have
declined
to
enter
upon
the
subject
;
but
how
could
he
do
so
with
a
beautiful
girl
,
with
the
daughter
of
the
man
whom
he
had
injured
,
with
his
own
love
?
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Eleanor
recollected
herself
,
and
again
summoned
up
her
energies
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Bold
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
have
come
here
to
implore
you
to
abandon
this
proceeding
.
"
<EOS>
He
stood
up
from
his
seat
,
and
looked
beyond
measure
distressed
.
<EOS>
"
To
implore
you
to
abandon
it
,
to
implore
you
to
spare
my
father
,
to
spare
either
his
life
or
his
reason
,
for
one
or
the
other
will
pay
the
forfeit
if
this
goes
on
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
much
I
am
asking
,
and
how
little
right
I
have
to
ask
anything
;
but
I
think
you
will
listen
to
me
as
it
is
for
my
father
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mr
Bold
,
pray
,
pray
do
this
for
us
;
 
pray
<EOS>
do
not
drive
to
distraction
a
man
who
has
loved
you
so
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
absolutely
kneel
to
him
,
but
she
followed
him
as
he
moved
from
his
chair
,
and
laid
her
soft
hands
imploringly
upon
his
arm
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
at
any
other
time
how
exquisitely
valuable
would
have
been
that
touch
!
<EOS>
but
now
he
was
distraught
,
dumbfounded
,
and
unmanned
.
<EOS>
What
could
he
say
to
that
sweet
suppliant
;
how
explain
to
her
that
the
matter
now
was
probably
beyond
his
control
;
how
tell
her
that
he
could
not
quell
the
storm
which
he
had
raised
?
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
surely
,
John
,
you
can
not
refuse
her
,
"
said
his
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
give
her
my
soul
,
"
said
he
,
"
if
it
would
serve
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr
Bold
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
"
do
not
speak
so
<EOS>
;
I
ask
nothing
for
myself
;
and
what
I
ask
for
my
father
,
it
can
not
harm
you
to
grant
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
give
her
my
soul
,
if
it
would
serve
her
,
"
said
Bold
,
still
addressing
his
sister
;
"
everything
I
have
is
hers
,
if
she
will
accept
it
;
my
house
,
my
heart
,
my
all
;
every
hope
of
my
breast
is
centred
in
her
;
her
smiles
are
sweeter
to
me
than
the
sun
,
and
when
I
see
her
in
sorrow
as
she
now
is
,
every
nerve
in
my
body
suffers
.
<EOS>
No
man
can
love
better
than
I
love
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
ejaculated
Eleanor
;
"
there
can
be
no
talk
of
love
between
us
.
<EOS>
Will
you
protect
my
father
from
the
evil
you
have
brought
upon
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Eleanor
,
I
will
do
anything
;
let
me
tell
you
how
I
love
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
she
almost
screamed
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
unmanly
of
you
,
Mr
Bold
.
<EOS>
Will
you
,
will
you
,
will
you
leave
my
father
to
die
in
peace
in
his
quiet
home
?
"
and
seizing
him
by
his
arm
and
hand
,
she
followed
him
across
the
room
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
leave
you
till
you
promise
me
;
I
'll
cling
to
you
in
the
street
;
I
'll
kneel
to
you
before
all
the
people
.
<EOS>
You
shall
promise
me
this
,
you
shall
promise
me
this
,
<EOS>
you
shall
 
<EOS>
"
And
she
clung
to
him
with
fixed
tenacity
,
and
reiterated
her
resolve
with
hysterical
passion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Speak
to
her
,
John
;
answer
her
,
"
said
Mary
,
bewildered
by
the
unexpected
vehemence
of
Eleanor
's
manner
;
"
you
can
not
have
the
cruelty
to
refuse
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Promise
me
,
promise
me
,
"
said
Eleanor
;
"
say
that
my
father
is
safe
;
 
one
word
will
do
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
true
you
are
;
say
one
word
,
and
I
will
let
you
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
still
held
him
,
and
looked
eagerly
into
his
face
,
with
her
hair
dishevelled
and
her
eyes
all
bloodshot
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
thought
now
of
herself
,
no
care
now
for
her
appearance
;
and
yet
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
her
half
<EOS>
so
lovely
;
he
was
amazed
at
the
intensity
of
her
beauty
,
and
could
hardly
believe
that
it
was
she
whom
he
had
dared
to
love
.
"
<EOS>
Promise
me
,
"
said
she
;
"
I
will
not
leave
you
till
you
have
promised
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
said
he
at
length
;
"
I
do
 
all
I
can
do
,
I
will
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
may
God
Almighty
bless
you
for
ever
and
ever
!
"
<EOS>
said
Eleanor
;
and
falling
on
her
knees
with
her
face
in
Mary
's
lap
,
she
wept
and
sobbed
like
a
child
:
<EOS>
her
strength
had
carried
her
through
her
allotted
task
,
but
now
it
was
well
nigh
exhausted
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
while
she
was
partly
recovered
,
and
got
up
to
go
,
and
would
have
gone
,
had
not
Bold
made
her
understand
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
explain
to
her
how
far
it
was
in
his
power
to
put
an
end
to
the
proceedings
which
had
been
taken
against
Mr
Harding
.
<EOS>
Had
he
spoken
on
any
other
subject
,
she
would
have
vanished
,
but
on
that
she
was
bound
to
hear
him
;
and
now
the
danger
of
her
position
commenced
.
<EOS>
While
she
had
an
active
part
to
play
,
while
she
clung
to
him
as
a
suppliant
,
it
was
easy
enough
for
her
to
reject
his
proffered
love
,
and
cast
from
her
his
caressing
words
;
but
now
 
now
that
he
had
yielded
,
and
was
talking
to
her
calmly
and
kindly
as
to
her
father
's
welfare
,
it
was
hard
enough
for
her
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Then
Mary
Bold
assisted
her
;
but
now
she
was
quite
on
her
brother
's
side
.
<EOS>
Mary
said
but
little
,
but
every
word
she
did
say
gave
some
direct
and
deadly
blow
.
<EOS>
The
first
thing
she
did
was
to
make
room
for
her
brother
between
herself
and
Eleanor
on
the
sofa
:
as
the
sofa
was
full
large
for
three
,
Eleanor
could
not
resent
this
,
nor
could
she
show
suspicion
by
taking
another
seat
;
but
she
felt
it
to
be
a
most
unkind
proceeding
.
<EOS>
And
then
Mary
would
talk
as
though
they
three
were
joined
in
some
close
peculiar
bond
together
;
as
though
they
were
in
future
always
to
wish
together
,
contrive
together
,
and
act
together
;
and
Eleanor
could
not
gainsay
this
;
she
could
not
make
another
speech
,
and
say
,
"
Mr
Bold
and
I
are
strangers
,
Mary
,
and
are
always
to
remain
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
explained
to
her
that
,
though
undoubtedly
the
proceeding
against
the
hospital
had
commenced
solely
with
himself
,
many
others
were
now
interested
in
the
matter
,
some
of
whom
were
much
more
influential
than
himself
;
that
it
was
to
him
alone
,
however
,
that
the
lawyers
looked
for
instruction
as
to
their
doings
,
and
,
more
important
still
,
for
the
payment
of
their
bills
;
and
he
promised
that
he
would
at
once
give
them
notice
that
it
was
his
intention
to
abandon
the
cause
.
<EOS>
He
thought
,
he
said
,
that
it
was
not
probable
that
any
active
steps
would
be
taken
after
he
had
seceded
from
the
matter
,
though
it
was
possible
that
some
passing
allusion
might
still
be
made
to
the
hospital
in
the
daily
_
Jupiter
_
.
<EOS>
He
promised
,
however
,
that
he
would
use
his
best
influence
to
prevent
any
further
personal
allusion
being
made
to
Mr
Harding
.
<EOS>
He
then
suggested
that
he
would
on
that
afternoon
ride
over
himself
to
Dr
Grantly
,
and
inform
him
of
his
altered
intentions
on
the
subject
,
and
with
this
view
,
he
postponed
his
immediate
return
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
all
very
pleasant
,
and
Eleanor
did
enjoy
a
sort
of
triumph
in
the
feeling
that
she
had
attained
the
object
for
which
she
had
sought
this
interview
;
but
still
the
part
of
Iphigenia
was
to
be
played
out
.
<EOS>
The
gods
had
heard
her
prayer
,
granted
her
request
,
and
were
they
not
to
have
their
promised
sacrifice
?
<EOS>
Eleanor
was
not
a
girl
to
defraud
them
wilfully
;
so
,
as
soon
as
she
decently
could
,
she
got
up
for
her
bonnet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
so
soon
?
"
said
Bold
,
who
half
an
hour
since
would
have
given
a
hundred
pounds
that
he
was
in
London
,
and
she
still
at
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
!
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
;
papa
will
feel
this
to
be
so
kind
.
<EOS>
"
She
did
not
quite
appreciate
all
her
father
's
feelings
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
must
tell
him
,
and
I
will
say
that
you
will
see
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
may
I
not
say
one
word
for
myself
?
"
said
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
fetch
you
your
bonnet
,
Eleanor
,
"
said
Mary
,
in
the
act
of
leaving
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
Mary
,
"
said
she
,
getting
up
and
catching
her
by
her
dress
;
"
do
n't
go
,
I
'll
get
my
bonnet
myself
.
"
<EOS>
But
Mary
,
the
traitress
,
stood
fast
by
the
door
,
and
permitted
no
such
retreat
.
<EOS>
Poor
Iphigenia
!
  
<EOS>
And
with
a
volley
of
impassioned
love
,
John
Bold
poured
forth
the
feelings
of
his
heart
,
swearing
,
as
men
do
,
some
truths
and
many
falsehoods
;
and
Eleanor
repeated
with
every
shade
of
vehemence
<EOS>
the
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
which
had
had
a
short
time
since
so
much
effect
;
but
now
,
alas
!
<EOS>
its
strength
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Let
her
be
never
so
vehement
,
her
vehemence
was
not
respected
;
all
her
"
No
,
no
,
no
's
"
were
met
with
counter
-
asseverations
,
and
at
last
were
overpowered
.
<EOS>
The
ground
was
cut
from
under
her
on
every
side
.
<EOS>
She
was
pressed
to
say
whether
her
father
would
object
;
whether
she
herself
had
any
aversion
(
aversion
!
<EOS>
God
help
her
,
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
the
word
nearly
made
her
jump
into
his
arms
)
;
any
other
preference
(
this
she
loudly
disclaimed
)
;
whether
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
love
him
(
Eleanor
could
not
say
that
it
was
impossible
)
:
and
so
at
last
all
her
defences
demolished
,
all
her
maiden
barriers
swept
away
,
she
capitulated
,
or
rather
marched
out
with
the
honours
of
war
,
vanquished
evidently
,
palpably
vanquished
,
but
still
not
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
confessing
it
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
the
altar
on
the
shore
of
the
modern
Aulis
reeked
with
no
sacrifice
.
   
<EOS>
MR
BOLD
'S
VISIT
TO
PLUMSTEAD
 
<EOS>
Whether
or
no
the
ill
-
natured
prediction
made
by
certain
ladies
in
the
beginning
of
the
last
chapter
was
or
was
not
carried
out
to
the
letter
,
I
am
not
in
a
position
to
state
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
however
,
certainly
did
feel
herself
to
have
been
baffled
as
she
returned
home
with
all
her
news
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
Certainly
she
had
been
victorious
,
certainly
she
had
achieved
her
object
,
certainly
she
was
not
unhappy
,
and
yet
she
did
not
feel
herself
triumphant
.
<EOS>
Everything
would
run
smooth
now
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
was
not
at
all
addicted
to
the
Lydian
school
of
romance
;
she
by
no
means
objected
to
her
lover
because
he
came
in
at
the
door
under
the
name
of
Absolute
,
instead
of
pulling
her
out
of
a
window
under
the
name
of
Beverley
;
and
yet
she
felt
that
she
had
been
imposed
upon
,
and
could
hardly
think
of
Mary
Bold
with
sisterly
charity
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
think
I
could
have
trusted
Mary
,
"
she
said
to
herself
over
and
over
again
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
that
she
should
have
dared
to
keep
me
in
the
room
when
I
tried
to
get
out
!
"
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
however
,
felt
that
the
game
was
up
,
and
that
she
had
now
nothing
further
to
do
but
to
add
to
the
budget
of
news
which
was
prepared
for
her
father
,
that
John
Bold
was
her
accepted
lover
.
  
<EOS>
We
will
,
however
,
now
leave
her
on
her
way
,
and
go
with
John
Bold
to
Plumstead
Episcopi
,
merely
premising
that
Eleanor
on
reaching
home
will
not
find
things
so
smooth
as
she
fondly
expected
;
two
messengers
had
come
,
one
to
her
father
and
the
other
to
the
archdeacon
,
and
each
of
them
much
opposed
to
her
quiet
mode
of
solving
all
their
difficulties
;
the
one
in
the
shape
of
a
number
of
_
The
Jupiter
_
,
and
the
other
in
that
of
a
further
opinion
from
Sir
Abraham
Haphazard
.
  
<EOS>
John
Bold
got
on
his
horse
and
rode
off
to
Plumstead
Episcopi
;
not
briskly
and
with
eager
spur
,
as
men
do
ride
when
self
-
satisfied
with
their
own
intentions
;
but
slowly
,
modestly
,
thoughtfully
,
and
somewhat
in
dread
of
the
coming
interview
.
<EOS>
Now
and
again
he
would
recur
to
the
scene
which
was
just
over
,
support
himself
by
the
remembrance
of
the
silence
that
gives
consent
,
and
exult
as
a
happy
lover
.
<EOS>
But
even
this
feeling
was
not
without
a
shade
of
remorse
.
<EOS>
Had
he
not
shown
himself
childishly
weak
thus
to
yield
up
the
resolve
of
many
hours
of
thought
to
the
tears
of
a
pretty
girl
?
<EOS>
How
was
he
to
meet
his
lawyer
?
<EOS>
How
was
he
to
back
out
of
a
matter
in
which
his
name
was
already
so
publicly
concerned
?
<EOS>
What
,
<EOS>
oh
what
!
<EOS>
was
he
to
say
to
Tom
Towers
?
<EOS>
While
meditating
these
painful
things
he
reached
the
lodge
leading
up
to
the
archdeacon
's
glebe
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
found
himself
within
the
sacred
precincts
.
  
<EOS>
All
the
doctor
's
children
were
together
on
the
slope
of
the
lawn
,
close
to
the
road
,
as
Bold
rode
up
to
the
hall
door
.
<EOS>
They
were
there
holding
high
debate
on
matters
evidently
of
deep
interest
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
,
and
the
voices
of
the
boys
had
been
heard
before
the
lodge
gate
was
closed
.
  
<EOS>
Florinda
and
Grizzel
,
frightened
at
the
sight
of
so
well
-
known
an
enemy
to
the
family
,
fled
on
the
first
appearance
of
the
horseman
,
and
ran
in
terror
to
their
mother
's
arms
;
not
for
them
was
it
,
tender
branches
,
to
resent
injuries
,
or
as
members
of
a
church
militant
to
put
on
armour
against
its
enemies
.
<EOS>
But
the
boys
stood
their
ground
like
heroes
,
and
boldly
demanded
the
business
of
the
intruder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
want
to
see
anybody
here
,
sir
?
"
said
Henry
,
with
a
defiant
eye
and
a
hostile
tone
,
which
plainly
said
that
at
any
rate
no
one
there
wanted
to
see
the
person
so
addressed
;
<EOS>
and
as
he
spoke
he
brandished
aloft
his
garden
water
-
pot
,
holding
it
by
the
spout
,
ready
for
the
braining
of
anyone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Henry
,
"
said
Charles
James
slowly
,
and
with
a
certain
dignity
of
diction
,
"
Mr
Bold
of
course
would
not
have
come
without
wanting
to
see
someone
;
if
Mr
Bold
has
a
proper
ground
for
wanting
to
see
some
person
here
,
of
course
he
has
a
right
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Samuel
stepped
lightly
up
to
the
horse
's
head
,
and
offered
his
services
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr
Bold
,
"
said
he
,
"
papa
,
I
'm
sure
,
will
be
glad
to
see
you
<EOS>
;
I
suppose
you
want
to
see
papa
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
hold
your
horse
for
you
?
<EOS>
Oh
what
a
very
pretty
horse
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
he
turned
his
head
and
winked
funnily
at
his
brothers
.
<EOS>
"
Papa
has
heard
such
good
news
about
the
old
hospital
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
We
know
you
'll
be
glad
to
hear
it
,
because
you
're
such
a
friend
of
grandpapa
Harding
,
and
so
much
in
love
with
Aunt
Nelly
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
d'ye
do
,
lads
?
"
said
Bold
,
dismounting
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
see
your
father
if
he
's
at
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lads
!
<EOS>
"
said
Henry
,
turning
on
his
heel
and
addressing
himself
to
his
brother
,
but
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
Bold
;
"
lads
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
if
we
're
lads
,
what
does
he
call
himself
?
"
  
<EOS>
Charles
James
condescended
to
say
nothing
further
,
but
cocked
his
hat
with
much
precision
,
and
left
the
visitor
to
the
care
of
his
youngest
brother
.
  
<EOS>
Samuel
stayed
till
the
servant
came
,
chatting
and
patting
the
horse
;
but
as
soon
as
Bold
had
disappeared
through
the
front
door
,
he
stuck
a
switch
under
the
animal
's
tail
to
make
him
kick
if
possible
.
  
<EOS>
The
church
reformer
soon
found
himself
_
tête
-
à
-
tête
_
with
the
archdeacon
in
that
same
room
,
in
that
sanctum
sanctorum
of
the
rectory
,
to
which
we
have
already
been
introduced
.
<EOS>
As
he
entered
he
heard
the
click
of
a
certain
patent
lock
,
but
it
struck
him
with
no
surprise
;
the
worthy
clergyman
was
no
doubt
hiding
from
eyes
profane
<EOS>
his
last
much
-
studied
sermon
;
for
the
archdeacon
,
though
he
preached
but
seldom
,
was
famous
for
his
sermons
.
<EOS>
No
room
,
Bold
thought
,
could
have
been
more
becoming
for
a
dignitary
of
the
church
;
each
wall
was
loaded
with
theology
;
over
each
separate
bookcase
was
printed
in
small
gold
letters
the
names
of
those
great
divines
whose
works
were
ranged
beneath
:
beginning
from
the
early
fathers
in
due
chronological
order
<EOS>
,
there
were
to
be
found
the
precious
labours
of
the
chosen
servants
of
the
church
down
to
the
last
pamphlet
written
in
opposition
to
the
consecration
of
Dr
Hampden
;
and
raised
above
this
were
to
be
seen
the
busts
of
the
greatest
among
the
great
:
<EOS>
Chrysostom
,
St
Augustine
,
Thomas
à
Becket
,
Cardinal
Wolsey
,
Archbishop
Laud
,
and
Dr
Philpotts
.
  
<EOS>
Every
appliance
that
could
make
study
pleasant
and
give
ease
to
the
overtoiled
brain
was
there
;
chairs
made
to
relieve
each
limb
and
muscle
;
reading
-
desks
and
writing
-
desks
to
suit
every
attitude
;
lamps
and
candles
mechanically
contrived
to
throw
their
light
on
any
favoured
spot
,
as
the
student
might
desire
;
a
shoal
of
newspapers
to
amuse
the
few
leisure
moments
which
might
be
stolen
from
the
labours
of
the
day
;
and
then
from
the
window
a
view
right
through
a
bosky
vista
along
which
ran
a
broad
green
path
from
the
rectory
to
the
church
,
 
at
the
end
of
which
the
tawny
-
tinted
fine
old
tower
was
seen
with
all
its
variegated
pinnacles
and
parapets
.
<EOS>
Few
parish
churches
in
England
are
in
better
repair
,
or
better
worth
keeping
so
,
than
that
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
;
and
yet
it
is
built
in
a
faulty
style
<EOS>
:
the
body
of
the
church
is
low
,
 
so
low
,
that
the
nearly
flat
leaden
roof
would
be
visible
from
the
churchyard
,
were
it
not
for
the
carved
parapet
with
which
it
is
surrounded
.
<EOS>
It
is
cruciform
,
though
the
transepts
are
irregular
,
one
being
larger
than
the
other
;
and
the
tower
is
much
too
high
in
proportion
to
the
church
.
<EOS>
But
the
colour
of
the
building
is
perfect
;
it
is
that
rich
yellow
gray
which
one
finds
nowhere
but
in
the
south
and
west
of
England
,
and
which
is
so
strong
a
characteristic
of
most
of
our
old
houses
of
Tudor
architecture
.
<EOS>
The
stone
work
also
is
beautiful
;
the
mullions
of
the
windows
and
the
thick
tracery
of
the
Gothic
workmanship
is
as
rich
as
fancy
can
desire
;
and
though
in
gazing
on
such
a
structure
<EOS>
one
knows
by
rule
that
the
old
priests
who
built
it
,
built
it
wrong
,
one
can
not
bring
oneself
to
wish
that
they
should
have
made
it
other
than
it
is
.
  
<EOS>
When
Bold
was
ushered
into
the
book
-
room
,
he
found
its
owner
standing
with
his
back
to
the
empty
fire
-
place
ready
to
receive
him
,
and
he
could
not
but
perceive
that
that
expansive
brow
was
elated
with
triumph
,
and
that
those
full
heavy
lips
bore
more
prominently
than
usual
an
appearance
of
arrogant
success
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr
Bold
,
"
said
he
;
 
"
well
,
what
can
I
do
for
you
?
<EOS>
Very
happy
,
I
can
assure
you
,
to
do
anything
for
such
a
friend
of
my
father
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
'll
excuse
my
calling
,
Dr
Grantly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
,
certainly
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
;
"
I
can
assure
you
,
no
apology
is
necessary
from
Mr
Bold
;
 
<EOS>
only
let
me
know
what
I
can
do
for
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dr
Grantly
was
standing
himself
,
and
he
did
not
ask
Bold
to
sit
,
and
therefore
he
had
to
tell
his
tale
standing
,
leaning
on
the
table
,
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
did
,
however
,
manage
to
tell
it
;
and
as
the
archdeacon
never
once
interrupted
him
,
or
even
encouraged
him
by
a
single
word
,
he
was
not
long
in
coming
to
the
end
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
Mr
Bold
,
I
'm
to
understand
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
that
you
are
desirous
of
abandoning
this
attack
upon
Mr
Harding
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Dr
<EOS>
Grantly
,
there
has
been
no
attack
,
I
can
assure
you
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
we
wo
n't
quarrel
about
words
;
I
should
call
it
an
attack
;
 
most
men
would
so
call
an
endeavour
to
take
away
from
a
man
every
shilling
of
income
that
he
has
to
live
upon
;
but
it
sha'n't
be
an
attack
,
if
you
do
n't
like
it
;
you
wish
to
abandon
this
 
this
little
game
of
backgammon
you
've
begun
to
play
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
intend
to
put
an
end
to
the
legal
proceedings
which
I
have
commenced
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
already
had
enough
of
it
;
well
,
I
ca
n't
say
that
I
am
surprised
;
carrying
on
a
losing
lawsuit
where
one
has
nothing
to
gain
,
but
everything
to
pay
,
is
not
pleasant
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bold
turned
very
red
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
"
You
misinterpret
my
motives
,
"
said
he
;
"
but
,
however
,
that
is
of
little
consequence
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
come
to
trouble
you
with
my
motives
,
but
to
tell
you
a
matter
of
fact
.
<EOS>
Good
-
morning
,
Dr
Grantly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
One
moment
,
 
one
moment
,
"
said
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
exactly
appreciate
the
taste
which
induced
you
to
make
any
personal
communication
to
me
on
the
subject
;
but
I
dare
say
I
'm
wrong
,
I
dare
say
your
judgment
is
the
better
of
the
two
;
but
as
you
have
done
me
the
honour
,
 
as
you
have
,
as
it
were
,
forced
me
into
a
certain
amount
of
conversation
on
a
subject
which
had
better
,
perhaps
,
have
been
left
to
our
lawyers

you
will
excuse
me
if
I
ask
you
to
hear
my
reply
to
your
communication

<EOS>
"
I
am
in
no

Dr
Grantly

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
am
,
Mr
Bold

my
time
is
not
exactly
leisure
time

and
,
therefore
,
if
you
please
,
we
'll
go
to
the
point
at
once
:
 
<EOS>
you
're
going
to
abandon
this
lawsuit
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
paused
for
a
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Dr
<EOS>
Grantly
,
I
am

<EOS>
"
Having
exposed
a
gentleman
who
was
one
of
your
father
's
warmest
friends
to
all
the
ignominy
and
insolence
which
the
press
could
heap
upon
his
name
,
having
somewhat
ostentatiously
declared
that
it
was
your
duty
as
a
man
of
high
public
virtue
to
protect
those
poor
old
fools
whom
you
have
humbugged
there
at
the
hospital
<EOS>
,
you
now
find
that
the
game
costs
more
than
it
's
worth
,
and
so
you
make
up
your
mind
to
have
done
with
it
.
<EOS>
A
prudent
resolution
,
Mr
Bold
;
but
it
is
a
pity
you
should
have
been
so
long
coming
to
it
.
<EOS>
Has
it
struck
you
that
we
may
not
now
choose
to
give
over
?
<EOS>
that
we
may
find
it
necessary
to
punish
the
injury
you
have
done
to
us
?
<EOS>
Are
you
aware
,
sir
,
that
we
have
gone
to
enormous
expense
to
resist
this
iniquitous
attempt
of
yours
?
"
  
<EOS>
Bold
's
face
was
now
furiously
red
,
and
he
nearly
crushed
his
hat
between
his
hands
;
but
he
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
found
it
necessary
to
employ
the
best
advice

money
could
procure

<EOS>
Are
you
aware

what
may

<EOS>
"
Not

I
dare

not

<EOS>
When
you
recklessly
put
this
affair
into

Mr
Finney
,
whose
six

eightpences

thirteen

fourpences

probably

entail
on

"
<EOS>
"
Mr

<EOS>
Did
you
come
here
merely
to
refer
me
to
the
lawyers
?
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
I
think
the
honour
of
your
visit
might
have
been
spared
!
<EOS>
And
now
,
sir
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
my
opinion
is
:
 
my
opinion
is
,
that
we
shall
not
allow
you
to
withdraw
this
matter
from
the
courts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
do
as
you
please
,
Dr
<EOS>
Grantly
;
good
-
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
out
,
sir
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
;
"
I
have
here
in
my
hands
the
last
opinion
given
in
this
matter
by
Sir
Abraham
Haphazard
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
have
already
heard
of
this
;
 
I
dare
say
it
has
had
something
to
do
with
your
visit
here
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
whatever
of
Sir
Abraham
Haphazard
or
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Be
that
as
it
may
,
here
it
is
;
he
declares
most
explicitly
that
under
no
phasis
of
the
affair
<EOS>
whatever
have
you
a
leg
to
stand
upon
;
that
Mr
Harding
is
as
safe
in
his
hospital
as
I
am
here
in
my
rectory
;
that
a
more
futile
attempt
to
destroy
a
man
was
never
made
,
than
this
which
you
have
made
to
ruin
Mr
Harding
.
<EOS>
Here
,
"
and
he
slapped
the
paper
on
the
table
,
"
I
have
this
opinion
from
the
very
first
lawyer
in
the
land
;
and
under
these
circumstances
you
expect
me
to
make
you
a
low
bow
for
your
kind
offer
to
release
Mr
Harding
from
the
toils
of
your
net
!
<EOS>
Sir
,
your
net
is
not
strong
enough
to
hold
him
;
sir
,
your
net
has
fallen
to
pieces
,
and
you
knew
that
well
enough
before
I
told
you
 
and
now
,
sir
,
I
'll
wish
you
good
-
morning
,
for
I
'm
busy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bold
was
now
choking
with
passion
.
<EOS>
He
had
let
the
archdeacon
run
on
because
he
knew
not
with
what
words
to
interrupt
him
;
but
now
that
he
had
been
so
defied
and
insulted
,
he
could
not
leave
the
room
without
some
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dr
Grantly
,
"
he
commenced
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
further
to
say
or
to
hear
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
do
myself
the
honour
to
order
your
horse
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
rang
the
bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
came
here
,
Dr
<EOS>
Grantly
,
with
the
warmest
,
kindest
feelings
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
,
of
course
you
did
;
nobody
doubts
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
the
kindest
feelings
;
 
and
they
have
been
most
grossly
outraged
by
your
treatment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
they
have
;
 
I
have
not
chosen
to
see
my
father
-
in
-
law
ruined
;
what
an
outrage
that
has
been
to
your
feelings
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
time
will
come
,
Dr
<EOS>
Grantly
,
when
you
will
understand
why
I
called
upon
you
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
doubt
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
Is
Mr
Bold
's
horse
there
?
<EOS>
That
's
right
;
open
the
front
door
.
<EOS>
Good
-
morning
,
Mr
Bold
;
"
and
the
doctor
stalked
into
his
own
drawing
-
room
,
closing
the
door
behind
him
,
and
making
it
quite
impossible
that
John
Bold
should
speak
another
word
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
got
on
his
horse
,
which
he
was
fain
to
do
feeling
like
a
dog
turned
out
of
a
kitchen
,
he
was
again
greeted
by
little
Sammy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
Mr
Bold
<EOS>
;
I
hope
we
may
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
again
before
long
;
I
am
sure
papa
will
always
be
glad
to
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
That
was
certainly
the
bitterest
moment
in
John
Bold
's
life
.
<EOS>
Not
even
the
remembrance
of
his
successful
love
could
comfort
him
;
nay
,
when
he
thought
of
Eleanor
he
felt
that
it
was
that
very
love
which
had
brought
him
to
such
a
pass
.
<EOS>
That
he
should
have
been
so
insulted
,
and
be
unable
to
reply
!
<EOS>
That
he
should
have
given
up
so
much
to
the
request
of
a
girl
,
and
then
have
had
his
motives
so
misunderstood
!
<EOS>
That
he
should
have
made
so
gross
a
mistake
as
this
visit
of
his
to
the
archdeacon
's
!
<EOS>
He
bit
the
top
of
his
whip
,
till
he
penetrated
the
horn
of
which
it
was
made
:
he
struck
the
poor
animal
in
his
anger
,
and
then
was
doubly
angry
with
himself
at
his
futile
passion
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
so
completely
checkmated
,
so
palpably
overcome
!
<EOS>
and
what
was
he
to
do
?
<EOS>
He
could
not
continue
his
action
after
pledging
himself
to
abandon
it
;
nor
was
there
any
revenge
in
that
;
 
it
was
the
very
step
to
which
his
enemy
had
endeavoured
to
goad
him
!
  
<EOS>
He
threw
the
reins
to
the
servant
who
came
to
take
his
horse
,
and
rushed
upstairs
into
his
drawing
-
room
,
where
his
sister
Mary
was
sitting
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
there
be
a
devil
,
"
said
he
,
"
a
real
devil
here
on
earth
,
it
is
Dr
Grantly
.
"
<EOS>
He
vouchsafed
her
no
further
intelligence
,
but
again
seizing
his
hat
,
he
rushed
out
,
and
took
his
departure
for
London
without
another
word
to
anyone
.
   
<EOS>
THE
WARDEN
'S
DECISION
 
<EOS>
The
meeting
between
Eleanor
and
her
father
was
not
so
stormy
as
that
described
in
the
last
chapter
,
but
it
was
hardly
more
successful
.
<EOS>
On
her
return
from
Bold
's
house
she
found
her
father
in
a
strange
state
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
sorrowful
and
silent
as
he
had
been
on
that
memorable
day
when
his
son
-
in
-
law
lectured
him
as
to
all
that
he
owed
to
his
order
;
nor
was
he
in
his
usual
quiet
mood
.
<EOS>
When
Eleanor
reached
the
hospital
,
he
was
walking
to
and
fro
upon
the
lawn
,
and
she
soon
saw
that
he
was
much
excited
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
London
,
my
dear
,
"
he
said
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
London
,
papa
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
to
London
;
I
will
have
this
matter
settled
some
way
;
there
are
some
things
,
Eleanor
,
which
I
can
not
bear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
papa
,
what
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
said
she
,
leading
him
by
the
arm
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
such
good
news
for
you
,
and
now
you
make
me
fear
I
am
too
late
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
,
before
he
could
let
her
know
what
had
caused
this
sudden
resolve
,
or
could
point
to
the
fatal
paper
which
lay
on
the
table
,
she
told
him
that
the
lawsuit
was
over
,
that
Bold
had
commissioned
her
to
assure
her
father
in
his
name
that
it
would
be
abandoned
,
 
that
there
was
no
further
cause
for
misery
,
that
the
whole
matter
might
be
looked
on
as
though
it
had
never
been
discussed
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
tell
him
with
what
determined
vehemence
she
had
obtained
this
concession
in
his
favour
,
nor
did
she
mention
the
price
she
was
to
pay
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
warden
did
not
express
himself
peculiarly
gratified
at
this
intelligence
,
and
Eleanor
,
though
she
had
not
worked
for
thanks
,
and
was
by
no
means
disposed
to
magnify
her
own
good
offices
,
felt
hurt
at
the
manner
in
which
her
news
was
received
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Bold
can
act
as
he
thinks
proper
,
my
love
,
"
said
he
;
"
if
Mr
Bold
thinks
he
has
been
wrong
,
of
course
he
will
discontinue
what
he
is
doing
;
but
that
can
not
change
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
papa
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
all
but
crying
with
vexation
;
"
I
thought
you
would
have
been
so
happy
;
 
I
thought
all
would
have
been
right
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Bold
,
"
continued
he
,
"
has
set
great
people
to
work
,
 
so
great
that
I
doubt
they
are
now
beyond
his
control
.
<EOS>
Read
that
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
warden
,
doubling
up
a
number
of
_
The
Jupiter
_
,
pointed
to
the
peculiar
article
which
she
was
to
read
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
the
last
of
the
three
leaders
,
which
are
generally
furnished
daily
for
the
support
of
the
nation
,
that
Mr
Harding
directed
her
attention
.
<EOS>
It
dealt
some
heavy
blows
on
various
clerical
delinquents
;
on
families
who
received
their
tens
of
thousands
yearly
for
doing
nothing
;
on
men
who
,
as
the
article
stated
,
rolled
in
wealth
which
they
had
neither
earned
nor
inherited
,
and
which
was
in
fact
stolen
from
the
poorer
clergy
.
<EOS>
It
named
some
sons
of
bishops
,
and
grandsons
of
archbishops
;
men
great
in
their
way
,
who
had
redeemed
their
disgrace
in
the
eyes
of
many
by
the
enormity
of
their
plunder
;
and
then
,
having
disposed
of
these
leviathans
,
it
descended
to
Mr
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
We
alluded
some
weeks
since
to
an
instance
of
similar
injustice
,
though
in
a
more
humble
scale
,
in
which
the
warden
of
an
almshouse
at
Barchester
has
become
possessed
of
the
income
of
the
greater
part
of
the
whole
institution
.
<EOS>
Why
an
almshouse
should
have
a
warden
we
can
not
pretend
to
explain
,
nor
can
we
say
what
special
need
twelve
old
men
can
have
for
the
services
of
a
separate
clergyman
,
seeing
that
they
have
twelve
reserved
seats
for
themselves
in
Barchester
Cathedral
.
<EOS>
But
be
this
as
it
may
,
let
the
gentleman
call
himself
warden
or
precentor
,
or
what
he
will
,
let
him
be
never
so
scrupulous
in
exacting
religious
duties
from
his
twelve
dependents
,
or
never
so
negligent
as
regards
the
services
of
the
cathedral
,
it
appears
palpably
clear
that
he
can
be
entitled
to
no
portion
of
the
revenue
of
the
hospital
,
excepting
that
which
the
founder
set
apart
for
him
;
and
it
is
equally
clear
that
the
founder
did
not
intend
that
three
-
fifths
of
his
charity
should
be
so
consumed
.
  
<EOS>
The
case
is
certainly
a
paltry
one
after
the
tens
of
thousands
with
which
we
have
been
dealing
,
for
the
warden
's
income
is
after
all
but
a
poor
eight
hundred
a
year
:
eight
hundred
a
year
is
not
magnificent
preferment
of
itself
,
and
the
warden
may
,
for
anything
we
know
,
be
worth
much
more
to
the
church
;
but
if
so
,
let
the
church
pay
him
out
of
funds
justly
at
its
own
disposal
.
  
<EOS>
We
allude
to
the
question
of
the
Barchester
almshouse
at
the
present
moment
,
because
we
understand
that
a
plea
has
been
set
up
which
will
be
peculiarly
revolting
to
the
minds
of
English
churchmen
.
<EOS>
An
action
has
been
taken
against
Mr
Warden
Harding
,
on
behalf
of
the
almsmen
,
by
a
gentleman
acting
solely
on
public
grounds
,
and
it
is
to
be
argued
that
Mr
Harding
takes
nothing
but
what
he
received
as
a
servant
of
the
hospital
,
and
that
he
is
not
himself
responsible
for
the
amount
of
stipend
given
to
him
for
his
work
.
<EOS>
Such
a
plea
would
doubtless
be
fair
,
if
anyone
questioned
the
daily
wages
of
a
bricklayer
employed
on
the
building
,
or
the
fee
of
the
charwoman
who
cleans
it
;
but
we
can
not
envy
the
feeling
of
a
clergyman
of
the
Church
of
England
who
could
allow
such
an
argument
to
be
put
in
his
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
If
this
plea
be
put
forward
we
trust
Mr
Harding
will
be
forced
as
a
witness
to
state
the
nature
of
his
employment
;
the
amount
of
work
that
he
does
;
the
income
which
he
receives
;
and
the
source
from
whence
he
obtained
his
appointment
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
think
he
will
receive
much
public
sympathy
to
atone
for
the
annoyance
of
such
an
examination
.
  
<EOS>
As
Eleanor
read
the
article
her
face
flushed
with
indignation
,
and
when
she
had
finished
it
,
she
almost
feared
to
look
up
at
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
"
said
he
,
"
what
do
you
think
of
that
;
 
is
it
worth
while
to
be
a
warden
at
that
price
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
papa
;
 
dear
papa
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Bold
ca
n't
un
-
write
that
,
<EOS>
my
dear
;
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bold
ca
n't
say
that
that
sha'n't
be
read
by
every
clergyman
at
Oxford
;
nay
,
by
every
gentleman
in
the
land
;
"
and
then
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
,
while
Eleanor
in
mute
despair
followed
him
with
her
eyes
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
my
dear
,
"
he
continued
,
speaking
now
very
calmly
,
and
in
a
forced
manner
very
unlike
himself
;
"
Mr
Bold
ca
n't
dispute
the
truth
of
every
word
in
that
article
you
have
just
read
 
nor
can
I.
"
Eleanor
stared
at
him
,
as
though
she
scarcely
understood
the
words
he
was
speaking
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
can
I
,
Eleanor
:
that
's
the
worst
of
all
,
or
would
be
so
if
there
were
no
remedy
.
<EOS>
I
have
thought
much
of
all
this
since
we
were
together
last
night
;
"
and
he
came
and
sat
beside
her
,
and
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
as
he
had
done
then
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
thought
much
of
what
the
archdeacon
has
said
,
and
of
what
this
paper
says
;
and
I
do
believe
I
have
no
right
to
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
right
to
be
warden
of
the
hospital
,
papa
?
"
  
"
No
right
to
be
warden
with
eight
hundred
a
year
;
no
right
to
be
warden
with
such
a
house
as
this
;
no
right
to
spend
in
luxury
money
that
was
intended
for
charity
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bold
may
do
as
he
pleases
about
his
suit
,
but
I
hope
he
will
not
abandon
it
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Eleanor
!
<EOS>
this
was
hard
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Was
it
for
this
she
had
made
her
great
resolve
!
<EOS>
For
this
that
she
had
laid
aside
her
quiet
demeanour
,
and
taken
upon
her
the
rants
of
a
tragedy
heroine
!
<EOS>
One
may
work
and
not
for
thanks
,
but
yet
feel
hurt
at
not
receiving
them
;
and
so
it
was
with
Eleanor
:
<EOS>
one
may
be
disinterested
in
one
's
good
actions
,
and
yet
feel
discontented
that
they
are
not
recognised
.
<EOS>
Charity
may
be
given
with
the
left
hand
so
privily
that
the
right
hand
does
not
know
it
,
and
yet
the
left
hand
may
regret
to
feel
that
it
has
no
immediate
reward
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
had
had
no
wish
to
burden
her
father
with
a
weight
of
obligation
,
and
yet
she
had
looked
forward
to
much
delight
from
the
knowledge
that
she
had
freed
him
from
his
sorrows
:
now
such
hopes
were
entirely
over
:
<EOS>
all
that
she
had
done
was
of
no
avail
;
she
had
humbled
herself
to
Bold
in
vain
;
the
evil
was
utterly
beyond
her
power
to
cure
!
  
<EOS>
She
had
thought
also
how
gently
she
would
whisper
to
her
father
all
that
her
lover
had
said
to
her
about
herself
,
and
how
impossible
she
had
found
it
to
reject
him
:
and
then
she
had
anticipated
her
father
's
kindly
kiss
and
close
embrace
as
he
gave
his
sanction
to
her
love
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
she
could
say
nothing
of
this
now
.
<EOS>
In
speaking
of
Mr
Bold
,
her
father
put
him
aside
as
one
whose
thoughts
and
sayings
and
acts
could
be
of
no
moment
.
<EOS>
Gentle
reader
,
did
you
ever
feel
yourself
snubbed
?
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
,
when
thinking
much
of
your
own
importance
,
find
yourself
suddenly
reduced
to
a
nonentity
?
<EOS>
Such
was
Eleanor
's
feeling
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
shall
not
put
forward
this
plea
on
my
behalf
,
"
continued
the
warden
.
<EOS>
"
Whatever
may
be
the
truth
of
the
matter
,
that
at
any
rate
is
not
true
;
and
the
man
who
wrote
that
article
is
right
in
saying
that
such
a
plea
is
revolting
to
an
honest
mind
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
up
to
London
,
my
dear
,
and
see
these
lawyers
myself
,
and
if
no
better
excuse
can
be
made
for
me
than
that
,
I
and
the
hospital
will
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
archdeacon
,
papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
my
dear
;
there
are
some
things
which
a
man
can
not
bear
:
 
I
can
not
bear
that
;
"
and
he
put
his
hand
upon
the
newspaper
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
will
the
archdeacon
go
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
To
tell
the
truth
,
Mr
Harding
had
made
up
his
mind
to
steal
a
march
upon
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
He
was
aware
that
he
could
take
no
steps
without
informing
his
dread
son
-
in
-
law
,
but
he
had
resolved
that
he
would
send
out
a
note
to
Plumstead
Episcopi
detailing
his
plans
,
but
that
the
messenger
should
not
leave
Barchester
till
he
himself
had
started
for
London
;
so
that
he
might
be
a
day
before
the
doctor
,
who
,
he
had
no
doubt
,
would
follow
him
.
<EOS>
In
that
day
,
if
he
had
luck
,
he
might
arrange
it
all
;
he
might
explain
to
Sir
Abraham
that
he
,
as
warden
,
would
have
nothing
further
to
do
with
the
defence
about
to
be
set
up
;
he
might
send
in
his
official
resignation
to
his
friend
the
bishop
,
and
so
make
public
the
whole
transaction
,
that
even
the
doctor
would
not
be
able
to
undo
what
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
He
knew
too
well
the
doctor
's
strength
and
his
own
weakness
to
suppose
he
could
do
this
,
if
they
both
reached
London
together
;
indeed
,
he
would
never
be
able
to
get
to
London
,
if
the
doctor
knew
of
his
intended
journey
in
time
to
prevent
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
think
not
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
start
before
the
archdeacon
could
be
ready
;
 
I
shall
go
early
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
will
be
best
,
papa
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
showing
that
her
father
's
ruse
was
appreciated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
yes
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
I
wish
to
do
all
this
before
the
archdeacon
can
 
can
interfere
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
great
deal
of
truth
in
all
he
says
;
 
he
argues
very
well
,
and
I
ca
n't
always
answer
him
;
but
there
is
an
old
saying
,
Nelly
:
"
Everyone
knows
where
his
own
shoe
pinches
!
"
<EOS>
He
'll
say
that
I
want
moral
courage
,
and
strength
of
character
,
and
power
of
endurance
,
and
it
's
all
true
;
but
I
'm
sure
I
ought
not
to
remain
here
,
if
I
have
nothing
better
to
put
forward
than
a
quibble
:
<EOS>
so
,
Nelly
,
we
shall
have
to
leave
this
pretty
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
's
face
brightened
up
,
as
she
assured
her
father
how
cordially
she
agreed
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
True
,
my
love
,
"
said
he
,
now
again
quite
happy
and
at
ease
in
his
manner
.
<EOS>
"
What
good
to
us
is
this
place
or
all
the
money
,
if
we
are
to
be
ill
-
spoken
of
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
papa
,
I
am
so
glad
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
darling
child
!
<EOS>
It
did
cost
me
a
pang
at
first
,
Nelly
,
to
think
that
you
should
lose
your
pretty
drawing
-
room
,
and
your
ponies
,
and
your
garden
<EOS>
:
the
garden
will
be
the
worst
of
all
;
 
but
there
is
a
garden
at
Crabtree
,
a
very
pretty
garden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Crabtree
Parva
was
the
name
of
the
small
living
which
Mr
Harding
had
held
as
a
minor
canon
,
and
which
still
belonged
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
worth
some
eighty
pounds
a
year
,
and
a
small
house
and
glebe
,
all
of
which
were
now
handed
over
to
Mr
Harding
's
curate
;
but
it
was
to
Crabtree
glebe
that
Mr
Harding
thought
of
retiring
.
<EOS>
This
parish
must
not
be
mistaken
for
that
other
living
,
Crabtree
Canonicorum
,
as
it
is
called
.
<EOS>
Crabtree
Canonicorum
is
a
very
nice
thing
;
there
are
only
two
hundred
parishioners
;
there
are
four
hundred
acres
of
glebe
;
and
the
great
and
small
tithes
,
which
both
go
to
the
rector
,
are
worth
four
hundred
pounds
a
year
more
.
<EOS>
Crabtree
Canonicorum
is
in
the
gift
of
the
dean
and
chapter
,
and
is
at
this
time
possessed
by
the
Honourable
and
<EOS>
Reverend
Dr
Vesey
Stanhope
,
who
also
fills
the
prebendal
stall
of
Goosegorge
in
Barchester
Chapter
,
and
holds
the
united
rectory
of
Eiderdown
and
Stogpingum
,
or
Stoke
Pinquium
,
as
it
should
be
written
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
same
Dr
Vesey
Stanhope
whose
hospitable
villa
on
the
Lake
of
Como
is
so
well
known
to
the
_
élite
_
of
English
travellers
,
and
whose
collection
of
Lombard
butterflies
is
supposed
to
be
unique
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
warden
,
musing
,
"
there
is
a
very
pretty
garden
at
Crabtree
;
 
but
I
shall
be
sorry
to
disturb
poor
Smith
.
<EOS>
"
Smith
was
the
curate
of
Crabtree
,
a
gentleman
who
was
maintaining
a
wife
and
half
a
dozen
children
on
the
income
arising
from
his
profession
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
assured
her
father
that
,
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
,
she
could
leave
her
house
and
her
ponies
without
a
single
regret
.
<EOS>
She
was
only
so
happy
that
he
was
going
 
going
where
he
would
escape
all
this
dreadful
turmoil
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
we
will
take
the
music
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
they
went
on
planning
their
future
happiness
,
and
plotting
how
they
would
arrange
it
all
without
the
interposition
of
the
archdeacon
,
and
at
last
they
again
became
confidential
,
and
then
the
warden
did
thank
her
for
what
she
had
done
,
and
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
lying
on
her
father
's
shoulder
,
did
find
an
opportunity
to
tell
her
secret
:
and
the
father
gave
his
blessing
to
his
child
,
and
said
that
the
man
whom
she
loved
was
honest
,
good
,
and
kind
-
hearted
,
and
right
-
thinking
in
the
main
,
 
one
who
wanted
only
a
good
wife
to
put
him
quite
upright
,
 
"
a
man
,
my
love
,
"
he
ended
by
saying
,
"
to
whom
I
firmly
believe
that
I
can
trust
my
treasure
with
safety
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
will
Dr
Grantly
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
it
ca
n't
be
helped
;
 
we
shall
be
out
at
Crabtree
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
Eleanor
ran
upstairs
to
prepare
her
father
's
clothes
for
his
journey
;
and
the
warden
returned
to
his
garden
to
make
his
last
adieux
to
every
tree
,
and
shrub
,
and
shady
nook
that
he
knew
so
well
.
   
<EOS>
MOUNT
OLYMPUS
 
<EOS>
Wretched
in
spirit
,
groaning
under
the
feeling
of
insult
,
self
-
condemning
,
and
ill
-
satisfied
in
every
way
,
Bold
returned
to
his
London
lodgings
.
<EOS>
Ill
as
he
had
fared
in
his
interview
with
the
archdeacon
<EOS>
,
he
was
not
the
less
under
the
necessity
of
carrying
out
his
pledge
to
Eleanor
;
and
he
went
about
his
ungracious
task
with
a
heavy
heart
.
  
<EOS>
The
attorneys
whom
he
had
employed
in
London
received
his
instructions
with
surprise
and
evident
misgiving
;
however
,
they
could
only
obey
,
and
mutter
something
of
their
sorrow
that
such
heavy
costs
should
only
fall
upon
their
own
employer
,
 
especially
as
nothing
was
wanting
but
perseverance
to
throw
them
on
the
opposite
party
.
<EOS>
Bold
left
the
office
which
he
had
latterly
so
much
frequented
,
shaking
the
dust
from
off
his
feet
;
and
before
he
was
down
the
stairs
,
an
edict
had
already
gone
forth
for
the
preparation
of
the
bill
.
  
<EOS>
He
next
thought
of
the
newspapers
.
<EOS>
The
case
had
been
taken
up
by
more
than
one
;
and
he
was
well
aware
that
the
keynote
had
been
sounded
by
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
very
intimate
with
Tom
Towers
,
and
had
often
discussed
with
him
the
affairs
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
Bold
could
not
say
that
the
articles
in
that
paper
had
been
written
at
his
own
instigation
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
even
know
,
as
a
fact
,
that
they
had
been
written
by
his
friend
.
<EOS>
Tom
Towers
had
never
said
that
such
a
view
of
the
case
,
or
such
a
side
in
the
dispute
,
would
be
taken
by
the
paper
with
which
he
was
connected
.
<EOS>
Very
discreet
in
such
matters
was
Tom
Towers
,
and
altogether
indisposed
to
talk
loosely
of
the
concerns
of
that
mighty
engine
of
which
it
was
his
high
privilege
to
move
in
secret
some
portion
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
Bold
believed
that
to
him
were
owing
those
dreadful
words
which
had
caused
such
panic
at
Barchester
,
 
and
he
conceived
himself
bound
to
prevent
their
repetition
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
he
betook
himself
from
the
attorneys
'
office
to
that
laboratory
where
,
with
amazing
chemistry
,
Tom
Towers
compounded
thunderbolts
for
the
destruction
of
all
that
is
evil
,
and
for
the
furtherance
of
all
that
is
good
,
in
this
and
other
hemispheres
.
  
<EOS>
Who
has
not
heard
of
Mount
Olympus
,
 
that
high
abode
of
all
the
powers
of
type
,
that
favoured
seat
of
the
great
goddess
Pica
,
that
wondrous
habitation
of
gods
and
devils
,
from
whence
,
with
ceaseless
hum
of
steam
and
never
-
ending
flow
of
Castalian
ink
,
issue
forth
fifty
thousand
nightly
edicts
for
the
governance
of
a
subject
nation
?
  
<EOS>
Velvet
and
gilding
do
not
make
a
throne
,
nor
gold
and
jewels
a
sceptre
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
throne
because
the
most
exalted
one
sits
there
,
 
and
a
sceptre
because
the
most
mighty
one
wields
it
.
<EOS>
So
it
is
with
Mount
Olympus
.
<EOS>
Should
a
stranger
make
his
way
thither
at
dull
noonday
,
or
during
the
sleepy
hours
of
the
silent
afternoon
,
he
would
find
no
acknowledged
temple
of
power
and
beauty
,
no
fitting
fane
for
the
great
Thunderer
,
no
proud
façades
and
pillared
roofs
to
support
the
dignity
of
this
greatest
of
earthly
potentates
.
<EOS>
To
the
outward
and
uninitiated
eye
,
Mount
Olympus
is
a
somewhat
humble
spot
,
 
undistinguished
,
unadorned
,
 
nay
,
almost
mean
.
<EOS>
It
stands
alone
,
as
it
were
,
in
a
mighty
city
,
close
to
the
densest
throng
of
men
,
but
partaking
neither
of
the
noise
nor
the
crowd
;
a
small
secluded
,
dreary
spot
,
tenanted
,
one
would
say
,
by
quite
unambitious
people
at
the
easiest
rents
.
<EOS>
"
Is
this
Mount
Olympus
?
"
asks
the
unbelieving
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
from
these
small
,
dark
,
dingy
buildings
that
those
infallible
laws
proceed
which
cabinets
are
called
upon
to
obey
;
by
which
bishops
are
to
be
guided
,
lords
and
commons
controlled
,
judges
instructed
in
law
,
generals
in
strategy
,
admirals
in
naval
tactics
,
and
orange
-
women
in
the
management
of
their
barrows
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
friend
 
from
these
walls
.
<EOS>
From
here
issue
the
only
known
infallible
bulls
for
the
guidance
of
British
souls
and
bodies
.
<EOS>
This
little
court
is
the
Vatican
of
England
.
<EOS>
Here
reigns
a
pope
,
self
-
nominated
,
self
-
consecrated
,
 
ay
,
and
much
stranger
too
,
 
self
-
believing
!
 
<EOS>
a
pope
whom
,
if
you
can
not
obey
him
,
I
would
advise
you
to
disobey
as
silently
as
possible
;
a
pope
hitherto
afraid
of
no
Luther
;
a
pope
who
manages
his
own
inquisition
,
who
punishes
unbelievers
as
no
most
skilful
inquisitor
of
Spain
ever
dreamt
of
doing
;
 
one
who
can
excommunicate
thoroughly
,
fearfully
,
radically
;
put
you
beyond
the
pale
of
men
's
charity
;
make
you
odious
to
your
dearest
friends
,
and
turn
you
into
a
monster
to
be
pointed
at
by
the
finger
!
"
<EOS>
Oh
heavens
!
<EOS>
and
this
is
Mount
Olympus
!
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
fact
amazing
to
ordinary
mortals
that
_
The
Jupiter
_
is
never
wrong
.
<EOS>
With
what
endless
care
,
with
what
unsparing
labour
,
do
we
not
strive
to
get
together
for
our
great
national
council
the
men
most
fitting
to
compose
it
.
<EOS>
And
how
we
fail
!
<EOS>
Parliament
is
always
wrong
:
look
at
_
The
Jupiter
_
,
and
see
how
futile
are
their
meetings
,
how
vain
their
council
,
how
needless
all
their
trouble
!
<EOS>
With
what
pride
do
we
regard
our
chief
ministers
,
the
great
servants
of
state
,
the
oligarchs
of
the
nation
on
whose
wisdom
we
lean
,
to
whom
we
look
for
guidance
in
our
difficulties
!
<EOS>
But
what
are
they
to
the
writers
of
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
?
<EOS>
They
hold
council
together
and
with
anxious
thought
painfully
elaborate
their
country
's
good
;
but
when
all
is
done
,
_
The
Jupiter
_
declares
that
all
is
naught
.
<EOS>
Why
should
we
look
to
Lord
John
Russell
;
 
why
should
we
regard
Palmerston
and
Gladstone
,
when
Tom
Towers
without
a
struggle
can
put
us
right
?
<EOS>
Look
at
our
generals
,
what
faults
they
make
;
at
our
admirals
,
how
inactive
they
are
.
<EOS>
What
money
,
honesty
,
and
science
can
do
,
is
done
;
and
yet
how
badly
are
our
troops
brought
together
,
fed
,
conveyed
,
clothed
,
armed
,
and
managed
.
<EOS>
The
most
excellent
of
our
good
men
do
their
best
to
man
our
ships
,
with
the
assistance
of
all
possible
external
appliances
;
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
All
,
all
is
wrong
 
alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
Tom
Towers
,
and
he
alone
,
knows
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
Why
,
oh
why
,
ye
earthly
ministers
,
why
have
ye
not
followed
more
closely
this
heaven
-
sent
messenger
that
is
among
us
?
  
<EOS>
Were
it
not
well
for
us
in
our
ignorance
that
we
confided
all
things
to
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
?
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
wise
in
us
to
abandon
useless
talking
,
idle
thinking
,
and
profitless
labour
?
<EOS>
Away
with
majorities
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
with
verdicts
from
judicial
bench
given
after
much
delay
,
with
doubtful
laws
,
and
the
fallible
attempts
of
humanity
!
<EOS>
Does
not
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
,
coming
forth
daily
with
fifty
thousand
impressions
full
of
unerring
decision
on
every
mortal
subject
,
set
all
matters
sufficiently
at
rest
?
<EOS>
Is
not
Tom
Towers
here
,
able
to
guide
us
and
willing
?
  
<EOS>
Yes
indeed
,
able
and
willing
to
guide
all
men
in
all
things
,
so
long
as
he
is
obeyed
as
autocrat
should
be
obeyed
,
 
with
undoubting
submission
:
only
let
not
ungrateful
ministers
seek
other
colleagues
than
those
whom
Tom
Towers
may
approve
;
let
church
and
state
,
law
and
physic
,
commerce
and
agriculture
,
the
arts
of
war
,
and
the
arts
of
peace
,
all
listen
and
obey
,
and
all
will
be
made
perfect
.
<EOS>
Has
not
Tom
Towers
an
all
-
seeing
eye
?
<EOS>
From
the
diggings
of
Australia
to
those
of
California
,
right
round
the
habitable
globe
,
does
he
not
know
,
watch
,
and
chronicle
the
doings
of
everyone
?
<EOS>
From
a
bishopric
in
New
Zealand
to
an
unfortunate
director
of
a
North
-
west
passage
,
is
he
not
the
only
fit
judge
of
capability
?
<EOS>
From
the
sewers
of
London
to
the
Central
Railway
of
India
,
 
from
the
palaces
of
St
Petersburg
to
the
cabins
of
Connaught
,
nothing
can
escape
him
.
<EOS>
Britons
have
but
to
read

to
obey

and
be
blessed
.
<EOS>
None
but
the
fools
doubt
the
wisdom
of
_
The
Jupiter
_
;
none
but
the
mad
dispute
its
facts
.
  
<EOS>
No
established
religion
has
ever
been
without
its
unbelievers
,
even
in
the
country
where
it
is
the
most
firmly
fixed
;
no
creed
has
been
without
scoffers
;
no
church
has
so
prospered
as
to
free
itself
entirely
from
dissent
.
<EOS>
There
are
those
who
doubt
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
!
<EOS>
They
live
and
breathe
the
upper
air
,
walking
here
unscathed
,
though
scorned
,
 
men
,
born
of
British
mothers
and
nursed
on
English
milk
,
who
scruple
not
to
say
that
Mount
Olympus
has
its
price
,
that
Tom
Towers
can
be
bought
for
gold
!
  
<EOS>
Such
is
Mount
Olympus
,
the
mouthpiece
of
all
the
wisdom
of
this
great
country
.
<EOS>
It
may
probably
be
said
that
no
place
in
this
19th
century
is
more
worthy
of
notice
.
<EOS>
No
treasury
mandate
armed
with
the
signatures
of
all
the
government
has
half
the
power
of
one
of
those
broad
sheets
,
which
fly
forth
from
hence
so
abundantly
,
armed
with
no
signature
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
Some
great
man
,
some
mighty
peer
,
 
we
'll
say
a
noble
duke
,
 
retires
to
rest
feared
and
honoured
by
all
his
countrymen
,
 
fearless
himself
;
if
not
<EOS>
a
good
man
,
at
any
rate
a
mighty
man
,
 
too
mighty
to
care
much
what
men
may
say
about
his
want
of
virtue
.
<EOS>
He
rises
in
the
morning
degraded
,
mean
,
and
miserable
;
an
object
of
men
's
scorn
,
anxious
only
to
retire
as
quickly
as
may
be
to
some
German
obscurity
,
some
unseen
Italian
privacy
,
or
indeed
,
anywhere
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
What
has
made
this
awful
change
?
<EOS>
what
has
so
afflicted
him
?
<EOS>
An
article
has
appeared
in
_
The
Jupiter
_
;
some
fifty
lines
of
a
narrow
column
have
destroyed
all
his
grace
's
equanimity
,
and
banished
him
for
ever
from
the
world
.
<EOS>
No
man
knows
who
wrote
the
bitter
words
;
the
clubs
talk
confusedly
of
the
matter
,
whispering
to
each
other
this
and
that
name
;
while
Tom
Towers
walks
quietly
along
Pall
Mall
,
with
his
coat
buttoned
close
against
the
east
wind
,
as
though
he
were
a
mortal
man
,
and
<EOS>
not
a
god
dispensing
thunderbolts
from
Mount
Olympus
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
to
Mount
Olympus
that
our
friend
Bold
betook
himself
.
<EOS>
He
had
before
now
wandered
round
that
lonely
spot
,
thinking
how
grand
a
thing
it
was
to
write
articles
for
_
The
Jupiter
_
;
considering
within
himself
whether
by
any
stretch
of
the
powers
within
him
he
could
ever
come
to
such
distinction
;
wondering
how
Tom
Towers
would
take
any
little
humble
offering
of
his
talents
;
calculating
that
Tom
Towers
himself
must
have
once
had
a
beginning
,
have
once
doubted
as
to
his
own
success
.
<EOS>
Towers
could
not
have
been
born
a
writer
in
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
.
<EOS>
With
such
ideas
,
half
ambitious
and
half
awe
-
struck
,
had
Bold
regarded
the
silent
-
looking
workshop
of
the
gods
;
but
he
had
never
yet
by
word
or
sign
attempted
to
influence
the
slightest
word
of
his
unerring
friend
.
<EOS>
On
such
a
course
was
he
now
intent
;
and
not
without
much
inward
palpitation
did
he
betake
himself
to
the
quiet
abode
of
wisdom
,
where
Tom
Towers
was
to
be
found
o
'
mornings
inhaling
ambrosia
and
sipping
nectar
in
the
shape
of
toast
and
tea
.
  
<EOS>
Not
far
removed
from
Mount
Olympus
,
but
somewhat
nearer
to
the
blessed
regions
of
the
West
,
is
the
most
favoured
abode
of
Themis
.
<EOS>
Washed
by
the
rich
tide
which
now
passes
from
the
towers
of
Cæsar
to
Barry
's
halls
of
eloquence
;
and
again
back
,
with
new
offerings
of
a
city
's
tribute
,
from
the
palaces
of
peers
to
the
mart
of
merchants
,
stand
those
quiet
walls
which
Law
has
delighted
to
honour
by
its
presence
.
<EOS>
What
a
world
within
a
world
is
the
Temple
!
<EOS>
how
quiet
are
its
"
entangled
walks
,
"
as
someone
lately
has
called
them
,
and
yet
how
close
to
the
densest
concourse
of
humanity
!
<EOS>
how
gravely
respectable
its
sober
alleys
,
though
removed
but
by
a
single
step
from
the
profanity
of
the
Strand
and
the
low
iniquity
of
Fleet
Street
!
<EOS>
Old
St
Dunstan
,
with
its
bell
-
smiting
bludgeoners
,
has
been
removed
;
the
ancient
shops
with
their
faces
full
of
pleasant
history
are
passing
away
one
by
one
;
the
bar
itself
is
to
go
 
<EOS>
its
doom
has
been
pronounced
by
_
The
Jupiter
_
;
rumour
tells
us
of
some
huge
building
that
is
to
appear
in
these
latitudes
dedicated
to
law
,
subversive
of
the
courts
of
Westminster
,
and
antagonistic
to
the
Rolls
and
Lincoln
's
Inn
;
but
nothing
yet
threatens
the
silent
beauty
of
the
Temple
:
it
is
the
mediæval
court
of
the
metropolis
.
  
<EOS>
Here
,
on
the
choicest
spot
of
this
choice
ground
,
stands
a
lofty
row
of
chambers
,
looking
obliquely
upon
the
sullied
Thames
;
before
the
windows
,
the
lawn
of
the
Temple
Gardens
stretches
with
that
dim
yet
<EOS>
delicious
verdure
<EOS>
so
refreshing
to
the
eyes
of
Londoners
.
<EOS>
If
doomed
to
live
within
the
thickest
of
London
smoke
you
would
surely
say
that
that
would
be
your
chosen
spot
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
you
,
you
whom
I
now
address
,
my
dear
,
middle
-
aged
bachelor
friend
,
can
nowhere
be
so
well
domiciled
as
here
.
<EOS>
No
one
here
will
ask
whether
you
are
out
or
at
home
;
alone
or
with
friends
;
here
no
Sabbatarian
will
investigate
your
Sundays
,
no
censorious
landlady
will
scrutinise
your
empty
bottle
,
no
valetudinarian
neighbour
will
complain
of
late
hours
.
<EOS>
If
you
love
books
,
to
what
place
are
books
so
suitable
?
<EOS>
The
whole
spot
is
redolent
of
typography
.
<EOS>
Would
you
worship
the
Paphian
goddess
,
the
groves
of
Cyprus
are
not
more
taciturn
than
those
of
the
Temple
.
<EOS>
Wit
and
wine
are
always
here
,
and
always
together
;
the
revels
of
the
Temple
are
as
those
of
polished
Greece
,
where
the
wildest
worshipper
of
Bacchus
never
forgot
the
dignity
of
the
god
whom
he
adored
.
<EOS>
Where
can
retirement
be
so
complete
as
here
?
<EOS>
where
can
you
be
so
sure
of
all
the
pleasures
of
society
?
  
<EOS>
It
was
here
that
Tom
Towers
lived
,
and
cultivated
with
eminent
success
the
tenth
Muse
who
now
governs
the
periodical
press
.
<EOS>
But
let
it
not
be
supposed
that
his
chambers
were
such
,
or
so
comfortless
,
as
are
frequently
the
gaunt
abodes
of
legal
aspirants
.
<EOS>
Four
chairs
,
a
half
-
filled
deal
book
-
case
with
hangings
of
dingy
green
baize
,
an
old
office
table
covered
with
dusty
papers
,
which
are
not
moved
once
in
six
months
,
and
an
older
Pembroke
brother
with
rickety
legs
,
for
all
daily
uses
;
a
despatcher
for
the
preparation
of
lobsters
and
coffee
,
and
an
apparatus
for
the
cooking
of
toast
and
mutton
chops
;
such
utensils
and
luxuries
as
these
did
not
suffice
for
the
well
-
being
of
Tom
Towers
.
<EOS>
He
indulged
in
four
rooms
on
the
first
floor
,
each
of
which
was
furnished
,
if
not
with
the
splendour
,
with
probably
more
than
the
comfort
of
Stafford
House
.
<EOS>
Every
addition
that
science
and
art
have
lately
made
to
the
luxuries
of
modern
life
was
to
be
found
there
.
<EOS>
The
room
in
which
he
usually
sat
was
surrounded
by
book
-
shelves
carefully
filled
;
nor
was
there
a
volume
there
which
was
not
entitled
to
its
place
in
such
a
collection
,
both
by
its
intrinsic
worth
and
exterior
splendour
:
a
pretty
portable
set
of
steps
in
one
corner
of
the
room
showed
that
those
even
on
the
higher
shelves
were
intended
for
use
.
<EOS>
The
chamber
contained
but
two
works
of
art
:
 
<EOS>
the
one
,
an
admirable
bust
of
Sir
Robert
Peel
,
by
Power
,
declared
the
individual
politics
of
our
friend
;
and
the
other
,
a
singularly
long
figure
of
a
female
devotee
,
by
Millais
,
told
equally
plainly
the
school
of
art
to
which
he
was
addicted
.
<EOS>
This
picture
was
not
hung
,
as
pictures
usually
are
,
against
the
wall
;
there
was
no
inch
of
wall
vacant
for
such
a
purpose
:
it
had
a
stand
or
desk
erected
for
its
own
accommodation
;
and
there
on
her
pedestal
,
framed
and
glazed
,
stood
the
devotional
lady
looking
intently
at
a
lily
as
no
lady
ever
looked
before
.
  
<EOS>
Our
modern
artists
,
whom
we
style
Pre
-
Raphaelites
,
have
delighted
to
go
back
,
not
only
to
the
finish
and
peculiar
manner
,
but
also
to
the
subjects
of
the
early
painters
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
give
them
too
much
praise
for
the
elaborate
perseverance
with
which
they
have
equalled
the
minute
perfections
of
the
masters
from
whom
they
take
their
inspiration
:
nothing
probably
can
exceed
the
painting
of
some
of
these
latter
-
day
pictures
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
however
,
singular
into
what
faults
they
fall
as
regards
their
subjects
:
they
are
not
quite
content
to
take
the
old
stock
groups
,
 
a
Sebastian
with
his
arrows
,
a
Lucia
with
her
eyes
in
a
dish
,
a
Lorenzo
with
a
gridiron
,
or
the
Virgin
with
two
children
.
<EOS>
But
they
are
anything
but
happy
in
their
change
.
<EOS>
As
a
rule
,
no
figure
should
be
drawn
in
a
position
which
it
is
impossible
to
suppose
any
figure
should
maintain
.
<EOS>
The
patient
endurance
of
St
Sebastian
,
the
wild
ecstasy
of
St
John
in
the
Wilderness
,
the
maternal
love
of
the
Virgin
,
are
feelings
naturally
portrayed
by
a
fixed
posture
;
but
the
lady
with
the
stiff
back
and
bent
neck
,
who
looks
at
her
flower
,
and
is
still
looking
from
hour
to
hour
,
gives
us
an
idea
of
pain
without
grace
,
and
abstraction
without
a
cause
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
easy
,
from
his
rooms
,
to
see
that
Tom
Towers
was
a
Sybarite
,
though
by
no
means
an
idle
one
.
<EOS>
He
was
lingering
over
his
last
cup
of
tea
,
surrounded
by
an
ocean
of
newspapers
,
through
which
he
had
been
swimming
,
when
John
Bold
's
card
was
brought
in
by
his
tiger
.
<EOS>
This
tiger
never
knew
that
his
master
was
at
home
,
though
he
often
knew
that
he
was
not
,
and
thus
Tom
Towers
was
never
invaded
but
by
his
own
consent
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
,
after
twisting
the
card
twice
in
his
fingers
,
he
signified
to
his
attendant
imp
that
he
was
visible
;
and
the
inner
door
was
unbolted
,
and
our
friend
announced
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
before
said
that
he
of
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
and
John
Bold
were
intimate
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
very
great
difference
in
their
ages
,
for
Towers
was
still
considerably
under
forty
;
and
when
Bold
had
been
attending
the
London
hospitals
,
Towers
,
who
was
not
then
the
great
man
that
he
had
since
become
,
had
been
much
with
him
.
<EOS>
Then
they
had
often
discussed
together
the
objects
of
their
ambition
and
future
prospects
;
then
Tom
Towers
was
struggling
hard
to
maintain
himself
,
as
a
briefless
barrister
,
by
shorthand
reporting
for
any
of
the
papers
that
would
engage
him
;
then
he
had
not
dared
to
dream
of
writing
leaders
for
_
The
Jupiter
_
,
or
canvassing
the
conduct
of
Cabinet
ministers
.
<EOS>
Things
had
altered
since
that
time
:
the
briefless
barrister
was
still
briefless
,
but
he
now
despised
briefs
:
could
he
have
been
sure
of
a
judge
's
seat
,
he
would
hardly
have
left
his
present
career
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
he
wore
no
ermine
,
bore
no
outward
marks
of
a
world
's
respect
;
but
with
what
a
load
of
inward
importance
was
he
charged
!
<EOS>
It
is
true
his
name
appeared
in
no
large
capitals
;
on
no
wall
was
chalked
up
"
Tom
Towers
for
ever
;
"
 
"
Freedom
of
the
Press
and
Tom
Towers
;
"
but
what
member
of
Parliament
had
half
his
power
?
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
in
far
-
off
provinces
men
did
not
talk
daily
of
Tom
Towers
<EOS>
but
they
read
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
,
and
acknowledged
that
without
_
The
Jupiter
_
life
was
not
worth
having
.
<EOS>
This
kind
of
hidden
but
still
conscious
glory
suited
the
nature
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
He
loved
to
sit
silent
in
a
corner
of
his
club
and
listen
to
the
loud
chattering
of
politicians
,
and
to
think
how
they
all
were
in
his
power
;
 
how
he
could
smite
the
loudest
of
them
,
were
it
worth
his
while
to
raise
his
pen
for
such
a
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
loved
to
watch
the
great
men
of
whom
he
daily
wrote
,
and
flatter
himself
that
he
was
greater
than
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
Each
of
them
was
responsible
to
his
country
,
each
of
them
must
answer
if
inquired
into
,
each
of
them
must
endure
abuse
with
good
humour
,
and
insolence
without
anger
.
<EOS>
But
to
whom
was
he
,
Tom
Towers
,
responsible
?
<EOS>
No
one
could
insult
him
;
no
one
could
inquire
into
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
speak
out
withering
words
,
and
no
one
could
answer
him
<EOS>
:
ministers
courted
him
,
though
perhaps
they
knew
not
his
name
;
bishops
feared
him
;
judges
doubted
their
own
verdicts
unless
he
confirmed
them
;
and
generals
,
in
their
councils
of
war
,
did
not
consider
more
deeply
what
the
enemy
would
do
,
than
what
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
would
say
.
<EOS>
Tom
Towers
never
boasted
of
_
The
Jupiter
_
;
he
scarcely
ever
named
the
paper
even
to
the
most
intimate
of
his
friends
;
he
did
not
even
wish
to
be
spoken
of
as
connected
with
it
;
but
he
did
not
the
less
value
his
privileges
,
or
think
the
less
of
his
own
importance
.
<EOS>
It
is
probable
that
Tom
Towers
considered
himself
the
most
powerful
man
in
Europe
;
and
so
he
walked
on
from
day
to
day
,
studiously
striving
to
look
a
man
,
but
knowing
within
his
breast
that
he
was
a
god
.

TOM

DR

AND
MR
SENTIMENT
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Bold
!
<EOS>
how
are
you
?
<EOS>
You
have
n't
breakfasted
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
hours
ago
.
<EOS>
And
how
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
When
one
Esquimau
meets
another
,
do
the
two
,
as
an
invariable
rule
,
ask
after
each
other
's
health
?
<EOS>
is
it
inherent
in
all
human
nature
to
make
this
obliging
inquiry
?
<EOS>
Did
any
reader
of
this
tale
ever
meet
any
friend
or
acquaintance
without
asking
some
such
question
,
and
did
anyone
ever
listen
to
the
reply
?
<EOS>
Sometimes
a
studiously
courteous
questioner
will
show
so
much
thought
in
the
matter
as
to
answer
it
himself
,
by
declaring
that
had
he
looked
at
you
he
need
n't
have
asked
;
meaning
thereby
to
signify
that
you
are
an
absolute
personification
of
health
:
but
such
persons
are
only
those
who
premeditate
small
effects
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
're
busy
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
rather
;
 
or
I
should
say
rather
not
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
a
leisure
hour
in
the
day
,
this
is
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
ask
you
if
you
can
oblige
me
in
a
certain
matter
.
"
  
<EOS>
Towers
understood
in
a
moment
,
from
the
tone
of
his
friend
's
voice
,
that
the
certain
matter
referred
to
the
newspaper
.
<EOS>
He
smiled
,
and
nodded
his
head
,
but
made
no
promise
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
this
lawsuit
that
I
've
been
engaged
in
,
"
said
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
Towers
intimated
that
he
was
aware
of
the
action
which
was
pending
about
the
hospital
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
've
abandoned
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
Towers
merely
raised
his
eyebrows
,
thrust
his
hands
into
his
trowsers
pockets
,
and
waited
for
his
friend
to
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
've
given
it
up
.
<EOS>
I
need
n't
trouble
you
with
all
the
history
;
but
the
fact
is
that
the
conduct
of
Mr
Harding
 
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
is
the
 
"
  
"
Oh
yes
,
the
master
of
the
place
;
the
man
who
takes
all
the
money
and
does
nothing
,
"
said
Tom
Towers
,
interrupting
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
about
that
;
but
his
conduct
in
the
matter
has
been
so
excellent
,
so
little
selfish
,
so
open
,
that
I
can
not
proceed
in
the
matter
to
his
detriment
.
<EOS>
"
Bold
's
heart
misgave
him
as
to
Eleanor
as
he
said
this
;
and
yet
he
felt
that
what
he
said
was
not
untrue
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
nothing
should
now
be
done
till
the
wardenship
be
vacant
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
be
again
filled
,
"
said
Towers
,
"
as
it
certainly
would
,
before
anyone
heard
of
the
vacancy
;
and
the
same
objection
would
again
exist
.
<EOS>
It
's
an
old
story
,
that
of
the
vested
rights
of
the
incumbent
;
but
suppose
the
incumbent
has
only
a
vested
wrong
,
and
that
the
poor
of
the
town
have
a
vested
right
,
if
they
only
knew
how
to
get
at
it
:
is
not
that
something
the
case
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bold
could
n't
deny
it
,
but
thought
it
was
one
of
those
cases
which
required
a
good
deal
of
management
before
any
real
good
could
be
done
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
pity
that
he
had
not
considered
this
before
he
crept
into
the
lion
's
mouth
,
in
the
shape
of
an
attorney
's
office
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
cost
you
a
good
deal
,
I
fear
,
"
said
Towers
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
few
hundreds
,
"
said
Bold
 
"
perhaps
three
hundred
;
I
ca
n't
help
that
,
and
am
prepared
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
philosophical
.
<EOS>
It
's
quite
refreshing
to
hear
a
man
talking
of
his
hundreds
in
<EOS>
so
purely
indifferent
a
manner
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
sorry
you
are
giving
the
matter
up
.
<EOS>
It
injures
a
man
to
commence
a
thing
of
this
kind
,
and
not
carry
it
through
.
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
that
?
"
<EOS>
and
he
threw
a
small
pamphlet
across
the
table
,
which
was
all
but
damp
from
the
press
.
  
<EOS>
Bold
had
not
seen
it
nor
heard
of
it
;
but
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
author
of
it
,
 
<EOS>
a
gentleman
whose
pamphlets
,
condemnatory
of
all
things
in
these
modern
days
,
had
been
a
good
deal
talked
about
of
late
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Pessimist
Anticant
was
a
Scotchman
,
who
had
passed
a
great
portion
of
his
early
days
in
Germany
;
he
had
studied
there
with
much
effect
,
and
had
learnt
to
look
with
German
subtilty
into
the
root
of
things
,
and
to
examine
for
himself
their
intrinsic
worth
and
worthlessness
.
<EOS>
No
man
ever
resolved
more
bravely
than
he
to
accept
as
good
nothing
that
was
evil
;
to
banish
from
him
as
evil
nothing
that
was
good
.
'
<EOS>
tis
a
pity
that
he
should
not
have
recognised
the
fact
,
that
in
this
world
no
good
is
unalloyed
,
and
that
there
is
but
little
evil
that
has
not
in
it
some
seed
of
what
is
goodly
.
  
<EOS>
Returning
from
Germany
,
he
had
astonished
the
reading
public
by
the
vigour
of
his
thoughts
,
put
forth
in
the
quaintest
language
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
write
English
,
said
the
critics
.
<EOS>
No
matter
,
said
the
public
;
we
can
read
what
he
does
write
,
and
that
without
yawning
.
<EOS>
And
so
Dr
Pessimist
Anticant
became
popular
.
<EOS>
Popularity
spoilt
him
for
all
further
real
use
,
as
it
has
done
many
another
.
<EOS>
While
,
with
some
diffidence
,
he
confined
his
objurgations
to
the
occasional
follies
or
shortcomings
of
mankind
;
while
he
ridiculed
the
energy
of
the
squire
devoted
to
the
slaughter
of
partridges
,
or
the
mistake
of
some
noble
patron
who
turned
a
poet
into
a
gauger
of
beer
-
barrels
,
it
was
all
well
;
we
were
glad
to
be
told
our
faults
and
to
look
forward
to
the
coming
millennium
,
when
all
men
,
having
sufficiently
studied
the
works
of
Dr
Anticant
,
would
become
truthful
and
energetic
.
<EOS>
But
the
doctor
mistook
the
signs
of
the
times
and
the
minds
of
men
,
instituted
himself
censor
of
things
in
general
,
and
began
the
great
task
of
reprobating
everything
and
everybody
,
without
further
promise
of
any
millennium
at
all
.
<EOS>
This
was
not
so
well
;
and
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
our
author
did
not
succeed
in
his
undertaking
.
<EOS>
His
theories
were
all
beautiful
,
and
the
code
of
morals
that
he
taught
us
certainly
an
improvement
on
the
practices
of
the
age
.
<EOS>
We
all
of
us
could
,
and
many
of
us
did
,
learn
much
from
the
doctor
while
he
chose
to
remain
vague
,
mysterious
,
and
cloudy
:
<EOS>
but
when
he
became
practical
,
the
charm
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
His
allusion
to
the
poet
and
the
partridges
was
received
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
poor
brother
,
"
said
he
,
"
slaughtered
partridges
a
score
of
brace
to
each
gun
,
and
poets
gauging
ale
-
barrels
,
with
sixty
pounds
a
year
,
at
Dumfries
,
are
not
the
signs
of
a
great
era
!
 
<EOS>
perhaps
of
the
smallest
possible
era
yet
written
of
.
<EOS>
Whatever
economies
we
pursue
,
political
or
other
,
let
us
see
at
once
that
this
is
the
maddest
of
the
uneconomic
:
partridges
killed
by
our
land
magnates
at
,
shall
we
say
,
a
guinea
a
head
,
to
be
retailed
in
Leadenhall
at
one
shilling
and
ninepence
,
with
one
poacher
in
limbo
for
every
fifty
birds
!
<EOS>
our
poet
,
maker
,
creator
,
gauging
ale
,
and
that
badly
,
with
no
leisure
for
making
or
creating
,
only
a
little
leisure
for
drinking
,
and
such
like
beer
-
barrel
avocations
!
<EOS>
Truly
,
a
cutting
of
blocks
with
fine
razors
while
we
scrape
our
chins
so
uncomfortably
with
rusty
knives
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
political
economist
,
master
of
supply
and
demand
,
division
of
labour
and
high
pressure
 
<EOS>
oh
,
my
loud
-
speaking
friend
,
tell
me
,
if
so
much
be
in
you
,
what
is
the
demand
for
poets
in
these
kingdoms
of
Queen
Victoria
,
and
what
the
vouchsafed
supply
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
all
very
well
:
this
gave
us
some
hope
.
<EOS>
We
might
do
better
with
our
next
poet
,
when
we
got
one
;
and
though
the
partridges
might
not
be
abandoned
,
something
could
perhaps
be
done
as
to
the
poachers
.
<EOS>
We
were
unwilling
,
however
,
to
take
lessons
in
politics
from
so
misty
a
professor
;
and
when
he
came
to
tell
us
that
the
heroes
of
Westminster
were
naught
,
we
began
to
think
that
he
had
written
enough
.
<EOS>
His
attack
upon
despatch
boxes
was
not
thought
to
have
much
in
it
;
but
as
it
is
short
,
the
doctor
shall
again
be
allowed
to
speak
his
sentiments
.
  
<EOS>
Could
utmost
ingenuity
in
the
management
of
red
tape
avail
anything
to
men
lying
gasping
,
 
we
may
say
,
all
but
dead
;
could
despatch
boxes
with
never
-
so
-
much
velvet
lining
and
Chubb
's
patent
be
of
comfort
to
a
people
_
in
extremis
_
,
<EOS>
I
also
,
with
so
many
others
,
would
,
with
parched
tongue

call
on
the
name
of
Lord
John
Russell

at
your
advice

Lord

being

Vain

What

<EOS>
are
there
other
doctors
'
new
names
,
disciples
who
have
not
burdened
their
souls
with
tape
?
<EOS>
Well

let
us
call
again
.
<EOS>
Oh

Disraeli
,
great
oppositionist
,
man
of
the
bitter
brow

<EOS>
or

Oh

They
come

serene
face

and
each
,
  
alas

me

<EOS>
alas

my

<EOS>
each
with
a
despatch
box

<EOS>
Oh

the
serenity
of
Downing
Street
!
  
<EOS>
My
brothers
,
when
hope
was
over
on
the
battle
-
field
,
when
no
dimmest
chance
of
victory
remained
,
the
ancient
Roman
could
hide
his
face
within
his
toga
,
and
die
gracefully
.
<EOS>
Can
you
and
I
do
so
now
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
"
twere
best
for
us
;
if
not
,
oh
my
brothers
,
we
must
die
disgracefully
,
for
hope
of
life
and
victory
<EOS>
I
see
none
left
to
us
in
this
world
below
.
<EOS>
I
for
one
can
not
trust
much
to
serene
face
and
despatch
box
!
  
<EOS>
There
might
be
truth
in
this
,
there
might
be
depth
of
reasoning
;
but
Englishmen
did
not
see
enough
in
the
argument
to
induce
them
to
withdraw
their
confidence
from
the
present
arrangements
of
the
government
,
and
Dr
Anticant
's
monthly
pamphlet
on
the
decay
of
the
world
did
not
receive
so
much
attention
as
his
earlier
works
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
confine
himself
to
politics
in
these
publications
,
but
roamed
at
large
over
all
matters
of
public
interest
,
and
found
everything
bad
.
<EOS>
According
to
him
nobody
was
true
,
and
not
only
nobody
,
but
nothing
;
a
man
could
not
take
off
his
hat
to
a
lady
without
telling
a
lie
;
 
the
lady
would
lie
again
in
smiling
.
<EOS>
The
ruffles
of
the
gentleman
's
shirt
would
be
fraught
with
deceit
,
and
the
lady
's
flounces
full
of
falsehood
.
<EOS>
Was
ever
anything
more
severe
than
that
attack
of
his
on
chip
bonnets
,
or
the
anathemas
with
which
he
endeavoured
to
dust
the
powder
out
of
the
bishops
'
wigs
?
  
<EOS>
The
pamphlet
which
Tom
Towers
now
pushed
across
the
table
was
entitled
"
Modern
Charity
,
"
and
was
written
with
the
view
of
proving
how
much
in
the
way
of
charity
was
done
by
our
predecessors
,
 
<EOS>
how
little
by
the
present
age
;
and
it
ended
by
a
comparison
between
ancient
and
modern
times
,
very
little
to
the
credit
of
the
latter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
at
this
,
"
said
Towers
,
getting
up
and
turning
over
the
pages
of
the
pamphlet
,
and
pointing
to
a
passage
near
the
end
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
friend
the
warden
,
who
is
so
little
selfish
,
wo
n't
like
that
,
I
fear
.
<EOS>
"
Bold
read
as
follows
    
Heavens
,
what
a
sight
!
<EOS>
Let
us
with
eyes
wide
open
see
the
godly
man
of
four
centuries
since
,
the
man
of
the
dark
ages
;
let
us
see
how
he
does
his
godlike
work
,
and
,
again
,
how
the
godly
man
of
these
latter
days
does
his
.
  
<EOS>
Shall
we
say
that
the
former
is
one
walking
painfully
through
the
world
,
regarding
,
as
a
prudent
man
,
his
worldly
work
,
prospering
in
it
as
a
diligent
man
will
prosper
,
but
always
with
an
eye
to
that
better
treasure
to
which
thieves
do
not
creep
in
?
<EOS>
Is
there
not
much
nobility
in
that
old
man
,
as
,
leaning
on
his
oaken
staff
,
he
walks
down
the
High
Street
of
his
native
town
,
and
receives
from
all
courteous
salutation
and
acknowledgment
of
his
worth
?
<EOS>
A
noble
old
man
,
my
august
inhabitants
of
Belgrave
Square
and
such
like
vicinity
,
 
a
very
noble
old
man
,
though
employed
no
better
than
in
the
wholesale
carding
of
wool
.
  
<EOS>
This
carding
of
wool
,
however
,
did
in
those
days
bring
with
it
much
profit
,
so
that
our
ancient
friend
,
when
dying
,
was
declared
,
in
whatever
slang
then
prevailed
,
to
cut
up
exceeding
well
.
<EOS>
For
sons
and
daughters
there
was
ample
sustenance
with
assistance
of
due
industry
;
for
friends
and
relatives
some
relief
for
grief
at
this
great
loss
;
for
aged
dependents
comfort
in
declining
years
.
<EOS>
This
was
much
for
one
old
man
to
get
done
in
that
dark
fifteenth
century
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
not
all
:
coming
generations
of
poor
wool
-
carders
should
bless
the
name
of
this
rich
one
;
and
a
hospital
should
be
founded
and
endowed
with
his
wealth
for
the
feeding
of
such
of
the
trade
as
could
not
,
by
diligent
carding
,
any
longer
duly
feed
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
"
Twas
thus
that
an
old
man
in
the
fifteenth
century
did
his
godlike
work
to
the
best
of
his
power
,
and
not
ignobly
,
as
appears
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
We
will
now
take
our
godly
man
of
latter
days
.
<EOS>
He
shall
no
longer
be
a
wool
-
carder
,
for
such
are
not
now
men
of
mark
.
<EOS>
We
will
suppose
him
to
be
one
of
the
best
of
the
good
,
one
who
has
lacked
no
opportunities
.
<EOS>
Our
old
friend
was
,
after
all
,
but
illiterate
;
our
modern
friend
shall
be
a
man
educated
in
all
seemly
knowledge
;
he
shall
,
in
short
,
be
that
blessed
being
,
 
a
clergyman
of
the
Church
of
England
!
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
in
what
perfectest
manner
does
he
in
this
lower
world
<EOS>
get
his
godlike
work
done
and
put
out
of
hand
?
<EOS>
Heavens
!
<EOS>
in
the
strangest
of
manners
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
brother
!
<EOS>
in
a
manner
not
at
all
to
be
believed
,
but
by
the
most
minute
testimony
of
eyesight
.
<EOS>
He
does
it
by
the
magnitude
of
his
appetite
,
 
by
the
power
of
his
gorge
;
his
only
occupation
is
to
swallow
the
bread
prepared
with
so
much
anxious
care
for
these
impoverished
carders
of
wool
,
 
that
,
and
to
sing
indifferently
through
his
nose
once
in
the
week
some
psalm
more
or
less
long
,
 
the
shorter
the
better
,
we
should
be
inclined
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
civilised
friends
!
 
<EOS>
great
Britons
that
never
will
be
slaves
,
men
advanced
to
infinite
state
of
freedom
and
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
;
 
tell
me
,
will
you
,
what
becoming
monument
you
will
erect
to
an
highly
-
educated
clergyman
of
the
Church
of
England
?
  
<EOS>
Bold
certainly
thought
that
his
friend
would
not
like
that
:
he
could
not
conceive
anything
that
he
would
like
less
than
this
.
<EOS>
To
what
a
world
of
toil
and
trouble
had
he
,
Bold
,
given
rise
by
his
indiscreet
attack
upon
the
hospital
!
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
said
Towers
,
"
that
this
affair
has
been
much
talked
of
,
and
the
public
are
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
you
should
give
the
matter
up
.
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
the
first
number
of
"
The
Almshouse
"
?
"
  
<EOS>
No
;
Bold
had
not
seen
"
The
Almshouse
.
"
<EOS>
He
had
seen
advertisements
of
Mr
Popular
Sentiment
's
new
novel
of
that
name
,
but
had
in
no
way
connected
it
with
Barchester
Hospital
,
and
had
never
thought
a
moment
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
direct
attack
on
the
whole
system
,
"
said
Towers
.
<EOS>
"
It
'll
go
a
long
way
to
put
down
Rochester
,
and
Barchester
,
and
Dulwich
,
and
St
Cross
,
and
all
such
hotbeds
of
peculation
.
<EOS>
It
's
very
clear
that
Sentiment
has
been
down
to
Barchester
,
and
got
up
the
whole
story
there
;
indeed
,
I
thought
he
must
have
had
it
all
from
you
;
it
's
very
well
done
,
as
you
'll
see
:
his
first
numbers
always
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bold
declared
that
Mr
Sentiment
had
got
nothing
from
him
,
and
that
he
was
deeply
grieved
to
find
that
the
case
had
become
so
notorious
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
fire
has
gone
too
far
to
be
quenched
,
"
said
Towers
;
"
the
building
must
go
now
;
and
as
the
timbers
are
all
rotten
,
why
,
I
should
be
inclined
to
say
,
the
sooner
the
better
.
<EOS>
I
expected
to
see
you
get
some
_
éclat
_
in
the
matter
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
all
wormwood
to
Bold
.
<EOS>
He
had
done
enough
to
make
his
friend
the
warden
miserable
for
life
,
and
had
then
backed
out
just
when
the
success
of
his
project
was
sufficient
to
make
the
question
one
of
real
interest
.
<EOS>
How
weakly
he
had
managed
his
business
!
<EOS>
he
had
already
done
the
harm
,
and
then
stayed
his
hand
when
the
good
which
he
had
in
view
was
to
be
commenced
.
<EOS>
How
delightful
would
it
have
been
to
have
employed
all
his
energy
in
such
a
cause
,
 
to
have
been
backed
by
_
The
Jupiter
_
,
and
written
up
to
by
two
of
the
most
popular
authors
of
the
day
!
<EOS>
The
idea
opened
a
view
into
the
very
world
in
which
he
wished
to
live
.
<EOS>
To
what
might
it
not
have
given
rise
?
<EOS>
what
delightful
intimacies
,
 
what
public
praise
,
 
to
what
Athenian
banquets
and
rich
flavour
of
Attic
salt
?
  
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
now
past
hope
.
<EOS>
He
had
pledged
himself
to
abandon
the
cause
;
and
could
he
have
forgotten
the
pledge
,
he
had
gone
too
far
to
retreat
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
,
this
moment
,
sitting
in
Tom
Towers
'
room
with
the
object
of
deprecating
any
further
articles
in
_
The
Jupiter
_
,
and
,
greatly
as
he
disliked
the
job
,
his
petition
to
that
effect
must
be
made
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
continue
it
,
"
said
he
,
"
because
I
found
I
was
in
the
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
Towers
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
How
could
a
successful
man
be
in
the
wrong
!
"
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
"
said
he
,
"
of
course
you
must
abandon
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
called
this
morning
to
ask
you
also
to
abandon
it
,
"
said
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
ask
me
,
"
said
Tom
Towers
,
with
the
most
placid
of
smiles
,
and
a
consummate
look
of
gentle
surprise
,
as
though
Tom
Towers
was
well
aware
that
he
of
all
men
was
the
last
to
meddle
in
such
matters
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Bold
,
almost
trembling
with
hesitation
.
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
,
you
know
,
has
taken
the
matter
up
very
strongly
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
has
felt
what
it
has
said
deeply
;
and
I
thought
that
if
I
could
explain
to
you
that
he
personally
has
not
been
to
blame
,
these
articles
might
be
discontinued
.
"
  
<EOS>
How
calmly
impassive
was
Tom
Towers
'
face
,
as
this
innocent
little
proposition
was
made
!
<EOS>
Had
Bold
addressed
himself
to
the
doorposts
in
Mount
Olympus
,
they
would
have
shown
as
much
outward
sign
of
assent
or
dissent
.
<EOS>
His
quiescence
was
quite
admirable
;
his
discretion
certainly
more
than
human
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
,
"
said
he
,
when
Bold
had
quite
done
speaking
,
"
I
really
can
not
answer
for
_
The
Jupiter
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
saw
that
these
articles
were
unjust
,
I
think
that
You
would
endeavour
to
put
a
stop
to
them
.
<EOS>
Of
course
nobody
doubts
that
you
could
,
if
you
chose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
and
everybody
are
always
very
kind
,
but
unfortunately
are
generally
very
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
come
,
Towers
,
"
said
Bold
,
plucking
up
his
courage
,
and
remembering
that
for
Eleanor
's
sake
he
was
bound
to
make
his
best
exertion
;
"
I
have
no
doubt
in
my
own
mind
but
that
you
wrote
the
articles
yourself
,
and
very
well
written
they
were
:
it
will
be
a
great
favour
if
you
will
in
future
abstain
from
any
personal
allusion
to
poor
Harding
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Bold
,
"
said
Tom
Towers
,
"
I
have
a
sincere
regard
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
known
you
for
many
years
,
and
value
your
friendship
;
I
hope
you
will
let
me
explain
to
you
,
without
offence
,
that
none
who
are
connected
with
the
public
press
can
with
propriety
listen
to
interference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Interference
!
"
said
Bold
,
"
I
do
n't
want
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
but
,
my
dear
fellow
,
you
do
;
what
else
is
it
?
<EOS>
You
think
that
I
am
able
to
keep
certain
remarks
out
of
a
newspaper
.
<EOS>
Your
information
is
probably
incorrect
,
as
most
public
gossip
on
such
subjects
is
;
but
,
at
any
rate
,
you
think
I
have
such
power
,
and
you
ask
me
to
use
it
:
now
that
is
interference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
you
choose
to
call
it
so
.
"
  
"
And
now
suppose
for
a
moment
that
I
had
this
power
,
and
used
it
as
you
wish
:
is
n't
it
clear
that
it
would
be
a
great
abuse
?
<EOS>
Certain
men
are
employed
in
writing
for
the
public
press
;
and
if
they
are
induced
either
to
write
or
to
abstain
from
writing
by
private
motives
,
surely
the
public
press
would
soon
be
of
little
value
.
<EOS>
Look
at
the
recognised
worth
of
different
newspapers
,
and
see
if
it
does
not
mainly
depend
on
the
assurance
which
the
public
feel
that
such
a
paper
is
,
or
is
not
,
independent
.
<EOS>
You
alluded
to
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
:
surely
you
can
not
but
see
that
the
weight
of
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
is
too
great
to
be
moved
by
any
private
request
,
even
though
it
should
be
made
to
a
much
more
influential
person
than
myself
:
you
've
only
to
think
of
this
,
and
you
'll
see
that
I
am
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
discretion
of
Tom
Towers
was
boundless
:
there
was
no
contradicting
what
he
said
,
no
arguing
against
such
propositions
.
<EOS>
He
took
such
high
ground
that
there
was
no
getting
on
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
The
public
is
defrauded
,
"
said
he
,
"
whenever
private
considerations
are
allowed
to
have
weight
.
"
<EOS>
Quite
true
,
thou
greatest
oracle
of
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
thou
sententious
proclaimer
of
the
purity
of
the
press
;
 
<EOS>
the
public
is
defrauded
when
it
is
purposely
misled
.
<EOS>
Poor
public
!
<EOS>
how
often
is
it
misled
!
<EOS>
against
what
a
world
of
fraud
has
it
to
contend
!
  
<EOS>
Bold
took
his
leave
,
and
got
out
of
the
room
as
quickly
as
he
could
,
inwardly
denouncing
his
friend
Tom
Towers
as
a
prig
and
a
humbug
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
wrote
those
articles
,
"
said
Bold
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
got
his
information
from
me
.
<EOS>
He
was
ready
enough
to
take
my
word
for
gospel
when
it
suited
his
own
views
,
and
to
set
Mr
Harding
up
before
the
public
as
an
impostor
on
no
other
testimony
than
my
chance
conversation
;
but
when
I
offer
him
real
evidence
opposed
to
his
own
views
,
he
tells
me
that
private
motives
are
detrimental
to
public
justice
!
<EOS>
Confound
his
arrogance
!
<EOS>
What
is
any
public
question
but
a
conglomeration
of
private
interests
?
<EOS>
What
is
any
newspaper
article
but
an
expression
of
the
views
taken
by
one
side
?
<EOS>
Truth
!
<EOS>
it
takes
an
age
to
ascertain
the
truth
of
any
question
!
<EOS>
The
idea
of
Tom
Towers
talking
of
public
motives
and
purity
of
purpose
!
<EOS>
Why
,
it
would
n't
give
him
a
moment

<EOS>
Such
were
John
Bold
's
inward
exclamations
as
he
made
his
way
out
of
the
quiet
labyrinth
of
the
Temple
;
and
yet
there
was
no
position
of
worldly
power
<EOS>
so
coveted
in
Bold
's
ambition
as
that
held
by
the
man
of
whom
he
was
thinking
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
impregnability
of
the
place
which
made
Bold
so
angry
with
the
possessor
of
it
,
and
it
was
the
same
quality
which
made
it
appear
so
desirable
.
  
<EOS>
Passing
into
the
Strand
,
he
saw
in
a
bookseller
's
window
an
announcement
of
the
first
number
of
"
The
Almshouse
;
"
so
he
purchased
a
copy
,
and
hurrying
back
to
his
lodgings
,
proceeded
to
ascertain
what
Mr
Popular
Sentiment
had
to
say
to
the
public
on
the
subject
which
had
lately
occupied
so
much
of
his
own
attention
.
  
<EOS>
In
former
times
great
objects
were
attained
by
great
work
.
<EOS>
When
evils
were
to
be
reformed
,
reformers
set
about
their
heavy
task
with
grave
decorum
and
laborious
argument
.
<EOS>
An
age
was
occupied
in
proving
a
grievance
,
and
philosophical
researches
were
printed
in
folio
pages
,
which
it
took
a
life
to
write
,
and
an
eternity
to
read
.
<EOS>
We
get
on
now
with
a
lighter
step
,
and
quicker
:
<EOS>
ridicule
is
found
to
be
more
convincing
than
argument
,
imaginary
agonies
touch
more
than
true
sorrows
,
and
monthly
novels
convince
,
when
learned
quartos
fail
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
If
the
world
is
to
be
set
right
,
the
work
will
be
done
by
shilling
numbers
.
  
<EOS>
Of
all
such
reformers
Mr
Sentiment
is
the
most
powerful
.
<EOS>
It
is
incredible
the
number
of
evil
practices
he
has
put
down
:
it
is
to
be
feared
he
will
soon
lack
subjects
,
and
that
when
he
has
made
the
working
classes
comfortable
,
and
got
bitter
beer
put
into
proper
-
sized
pint
bottles
,
there
will
be
nothing
further
for
him
left
to
do
.
<EOS>
Mr
Sentiment
is
certainly
a
very
powerful
man
,
and
perhaps
not
the
less
so
that
his
good
poor
people
are
so
very
good
;
his
hard
rich
people
so
very
hard
;
and
the
genuinely
honest
so
very
honest
.
<EOS>
Namby
-
pamby
in
these
days
is
not
thrown
away
if
it
be
introduced
in
the
proper
quarters
.
<EOS>
Divine
peeresses
are
no
longer
interesting
,
though
possessed
of
every
virtue
;
but
a
pattern
peasant
or
an
immaculate
manufacturing
hero
may
talk
as
much
twaddle
as
one
of
Mrs
Ratcliffe
's
heroines
,
and
still
be
listened
to
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
however
,
Mr
Sentiment
's
great
attraction
is
in
his
second
-
rate
characters
.
<EOS>
If
his
heroes
and
heroines
walk
upon
stilts
,
as
heroes
and
heroines
,
I
fear
,
ever
must
,
their
attendant
satellites
are
as
natural
as
though
one
met
them
in
the
street
:
they
walk
and
talk
like
men
and
women
,
and
live
among
our
friends
a
rattling
,
lively
life
;
yes
,
live
,
and
will
live
till
the
names
of
their
calling
shall
be
forgotten
in
their
own
,
and
Buckett
and
Mrs
Gamp
will
be
the
only
words
left
to
us
to
signify
a
detective
police
officer
or
a
monthly
nurse
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Almshouse
"
opened
with
a
scene
in
a
clergyman
's
house
.
<EOS>
Every
luxury
to
be
purchased
by
wealth
was
described
as
being
there
:
all
the
appearances
of
household
indulgence
generally
found
amongst
the
most
self
-
indulgent
of
the
rich
were
crowded
into
this
abode
.
<EOS>
Here
the
reader
was
introduced
to
the
demon
of
the
book
,
the
Mephistopheles
of
the
drama
.
<EOS>
What
story
was
ever
written
without
a
demon
?
<EOS>
What
novel
,
what
history
,
what
work
of
any
sort
,
what
world
,
would
be
perfect
without
existing
principles
both
of
good
and
evil
?
<EOS>
The
demon
of
"
The
Almshouse
"
was
the
clerical
owner
of
this
comfortable
abode
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
well
stricken
in
years
,
but
still
strong
to
do
evil
:
he
was
one
who
looked
cruelly
out
of
a
hot
,
passionate
,
bloodshot
eye
;
who
had
a
huge
red
nose
with
a
carbuncle
,
thick
lips
,
and
a
great
double
,
flabby
chin
,
which
swelled
out
into
solid
substance
,
like
a
turkey
-
cock
's
comb
,
when
sudden
anger
inspired
him
:
<EOS>
he
had
a
hot
,
furrowed
,
low
brow
,
from
which
a
few
grizzled
hairs
were
not
yet
rubbed
off
by
the
friction
of
his
handkerchief
:
he
wore
a
loose
unstarched
white
handkerchief
,
black
loose
ill
-
made
clothes
,
and
huge
loose
shoes
,
adapted
to
many
corns
and
various
bunions
:
his
husky
voice
told
tales
of
much
daily
port
wine
,
and
his
language
was
not
so
decorous
as
became
a
clergyman
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
master
of
Mr
Sentiment
's
"
Almshouse
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
a
widower
,
but
at
present
accompanied
by
two
daughters
,
and
a
thin
and
somewhat
insipid
curate
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
young
ladies
was
devoted
to
her
father
and
the
fashionable
world
,
and
she
of
course
was
the
favourite
;
the
other
was
equally
addicted
to
Puseyism
and
the
curate
.
  
<EOS>
The
second
chapter
of
course
introduced
the
reader
to
the
more
especial
inmates
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
Here
were
discovered
eight
old
men
;
and
it
was
given
to
be
understood
that
four
vacancies
remained
unfilled
,
through
the
perverse
ill
-
nature
of
the
clerical
gentleman
with
the
double
chin
.
<EOS>
The
state
of
these
eight
paupers
was
touchingly
dreadful
:
sixpence
-
farthing
a
day
had
been
sufficient
for
their
diet
when
the
almshouse
was
founded
;
and
on
sixpence
-
farthing
a
day
were
they
still
doomed
to
starve
,
though
food
was
four
times
as
dear
,
and
money
four
times
as
plentiful
.
<EOS>
It
was
shocking
to
find
how
the
conversation
of
these
eight
starved
old
men
in
their
dormitory
<EOS>
shamed
that
of
the
clergyman
's
family
in
his
rich
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
absolute
words
they
uttered
were
not
perhaps
spoken
in
the
purest
English
,
and
it
might
be
difficult
to
distinguish
from
their
dialect
to
what
part
of
the
country
they
belonged
;
the
beauty
of
the
sentiment
,
however
,
amply
atoned
for
the
imperfection
of
the
language
;
and
it
was
really
a
pity
that
these
eight
old
men
could
not
be
sent
through
the
country
as
moral
missionaries
,
instead
of
being
immured
and
starved
in
that
wretched
almshouse
.
  
<EOS>
Bold
finished
the
number
;
and
as
he
threw
it
aside
,
he
thought
that
that
at
least
had
no
direct
appliance
to
Mr
Harding
,
and
that
the
absurdly
strong
colouring
of
the
picture
would
disenable
the
work
from
doing
either
good
or
harm
.
<EOS>
He
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
The
artist
who
paints
for
the
million
must
use
glaring
colours
,
as
no
one
knew
better
than
Mr
Sentiment
when
he
described
the
inhabitants
of
his
almshouse
;
and
the
radical
reform
which
has
now
swept
over
such
establishments
has
owed
more
to
the
twenty
numbers
of
Mr
Sentiment
's
novel
,
than
to
all
the
true
complaints
which
have
escaped
from
the
public
for
the
last
half
century
.
   
<EOS>
A
LONG
DAY
IN
LONDON
 
<EOS>
The
warden
had
to
make
use
of
all
his
very
moderate
powers
of
intrigue
to
give
his
son
-
in
-
law
the
slip
,
and
get
out
of
Barchester
without
being
stopped
on
his
road
.
<EOS>
No
schoolboy
ever
ran
away
from
school
with
more
precaution
and
more
dread
of
detection
;
no
convict
,
slipping
down
from
a
prison
wall
,
ever
feared
to
see
the
gaoler
more
entirely
than
Mr
Harding
did
to
see
his
son
-
in
-
law
as
he
drove
up
in
the
pony
carriage
to
the
railway
station
,
on
the
morning
of
his
escape
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
The
evening
before
he
went
he
wrote
a
note
to
the
archdeacon
,
explaining
that
he
should
start
on
the
morrow
on
his
journey
<EOS>
;
that
it
was
his
intention
to
see
the
attorney
-
general
if
possible
,
and
to
decide
on
his
future
plans
in
accordance
with
what
he
heard
from
that
gentleman
;
he
excused
himself
for
giving
Dr
Grantly
no
earlier
notice
,
by
stating
that
his
resolve
was
very
sudden
;
and
having
entrusted
this
note
to
Eleanor
,
with
the
perfect
,
though
not
expressed
,
understanding
that
it
was
to
be
sent
over
to
Plumstead
Episcopi
without
haste
,
he
took
his
departure
.
  
<EOS>
He
also
prepared
and
carried
with
him
a
note
for
Sir
Abraham
Haphazard
,
in
which
he
stated
his
name
,
explaining
that
he
was
the
defendant
in
the
case
of
"
The
Queen
on
behalf
of
the
Wool
-
carders
of
Barchester
<EOS>
_
v
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
Trustees
under
the
will
of
the
late
John
Hiram
,
"
<EOS>
for
so
was
the
suit
denominated
,
and
begged
the
illustrious
and
learned
gentleman
to
vouchsafe
to
him
ten
minutes
'
audience
at
any
hour
on
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
calculated
that
for
that
one
day
he
was
safe
;
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
he
had
no
doubt
,
would
arrive
in
town
by
an
early
train
,
but
not
early
enough
to
reach
the
truant
till
he
should
have
escaped
from
his
hotel
after
breakfast
;
and
could
he
thus
manage
to
see
the
lawyer
on
that
very
day
,
the
deed
might
be
done
before
the
archdeacon
could
interfere
.
  
<EOS>
On
his
arrival
in
town
the
warden
drove
,
as
was
his
wo
nt
,
to
the
Chapter
Hotel
and
Coffee
House
,
near
St
Paul
's
.
<EOS>
His
visits
to
London
of
late
had
not
been
frequent
;
but
in
those
happy
days
when
"
Harding
's
Church
Music
"
was
going
through
the
press
,
he
had
been
often
there
;
and
as
the
publisher
's
house
was
in
Paternoster
Row
,
and
the
printer
's
press
in
Fleet
Street
,
the
Chapter
Hotel
and
Coffee
House
had
been
convenient
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
quiet
,
sombre
,
clerical
house
,
beseeming
such
a
man
as
the
warden
,
and
thus
he
afterwards
frequented
it
.
<EOS>
Had
he
dared
,
he
would
on
this
occasion
have
gone
elsewhere
to
throw
the
archdeacon
further
off
the
scent
;
but
he
did
not
know
what
violent
steps
his
son
-
in
-
law
might
take
for
his
recovery
if
he
were
not
found
at
his
usual
haunt
,
and
he
deemed
it
not
prudent
to
make
himself
the
object
of
a
hunt
through
London
.
  
<EOS>
Arrived
at
his
inn
,
he
ordered
dinner
,
and
went
forth
to
the
attorney
-
general
's
chambers
.
<EOS>
There
he
learnt
that
Sir
Abraham
was
in
Court
,
and
would
not
probably
return
that
day
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
direct
from
Court
to
the
House
;
all
appointments
were
,
as
a
rule
,
made
at
the
chambers
;
the
clerk
could
by
no
means
promise
an
interview
for
the
next
day
;
was
able
,
on
the
other
hand
,
to
say
that
such
interview
was
,
he
thought
,
impossible
;
but
that
Sir
Abraham
would
certainly
be
at
the
House
in
the
course
of
the
night
,
where
an
answer
from
himself
might
possibly
be
elicited
.
  
<EOS>
To
the
House
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
went
,
and
left
his
note
,
not
finding
Sir
Abraham
there
.
<EOS>
He
added
a
most
piteous
entreaty
that
he
might
be
favoured
with
an
answer
that
evening
,
for
which
he
would
return
.
<EOS>
He
then
journeyed
back
sadly
to
the
Chapter
Coffee
House
,
digesting
his
great
thoughts
,
as
best
he
might
,
in
a
clattering
omnibus
,
wedged
in
between
a
wet
old
lady
and
a
journeyman
glazier
returning
from
his
work
with
his
tools
in
his
lap
.
<EOS>
In
melancholy
solitude
he
discussed
his
mutton
chop
and
pint
of
port
.
<EOS>
What
is
there
in
this
world
more
melancholy
than
such
a
dinner
?
<EOS>
A
dinner
,
though
eaten
alone
,
in
a
country
hotel
may
be
worthy
of
some
energy
;
the
waiter
,
if
you
are
known
,
will
make
much
of
you
;
the
landlord
will
make
you
a
bow
and
perhaps
put
the
fish
on
the
table
;
if
you
ring
you
are
attended
to
,
and
there
is
some
life
about
it
.
<EOS>
A
dinner
at
a
London
eating
-
house
is
also
lively
enough
,
if
it
have
no
other
attraction
.
<EOS>
There
is
plenty
of
noise
and
stir
about
it
,
and
the
rapid
whirl
of
voices
and
rattle
of
dishes
disperses
sadness
.
<EOS>
But
a
solitary
dinner
in
an
old
,
respectable
,
sombre
,
solid
London
inn
,
where
nothing
makes
any
noise
but
the
old
waiter
's
creaking
shoes
;
where
one
plate
slowly
goes
and
another
slowly
comes
without
a
sound
;
where
the
two
or
three
guests
would
as
soon
think
of
knocking
each
other
down
as
of
speaking
;
where
the
servants
whisper
,
and
the
whole
household
is
disturbed
if
an
order
be
given
above
the
voice
,
 
what
can
be
more
melancholy
than
a
mutton
chop
and
a
pint
of
port
in
such
a
place
?
  
<EOS>
Having
gone
through
this
Mr
Harding
got
into
another
omnibus
,
and
again
returned
to
the
House
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
Sir
Abraham
was
there
,
and
was
that
moment
on
his
legs
,
fighting
eagerly
for
the
hundred
and
seventh
clause
of
the
Convent
Custody
Bill
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
's
note
had
been
delivered
to
him
;
and
if
Mr
Harding
would
wait
some
two
or
three
hours
,
Sir
Abraham
could
be
asked
whether
there
was
any
answer
.
<EOS>
The
House
was
not
full
,
and
perhaps
Mr
Harding
might
get
admittance
into
the
Strangers
'
Gallery
,
which
admission
,
with
the
help
of
five
shillings
,
Mr
Harding
was
able
to
effect
.
  
<EOS>
This
bill
of
Sir
Abraham
's
had
been
read
a
second
time
and
passed
into
committee
.
<EOS>
A
hundred
and
six
clauses
had
already
been
discussed
and
had
occupied
only
four
mornings
and
five
evening
sittings
;
nine
of
the
hundred
and
six
clauses
were
passed
,
fifty
-
five
were
withdrawn
by
consent
,
fourteen
had
been
altered
so
as
to
mean
the
reverse
of
the
original
proposition
,
eleven
had
been
postponed
for
further
consideration
,
and
seventeen
had
been
directly
negatived
.
<EOS>
The
hundred
and
seventh
ordered
the
bodily
searching
of
nuns
for
jesuitical
symbols
by
aged
clergymen
,
and
was
considered
to
be
the
real
mainstay
of
the
whole
bill
.
<EOS>
No
intention
had
ever
existed
to
pass
such
a
law
as
that
proposed
,
but
the
government
did
not
intend
to
abandon
it
till
their
object
was
fully
attained
by
the
discussion
of
this
clause
.
<EOS>
It
was
known
that
it
would
be
insisted
on
with
terrible
vehemence
by
Protestant
Irish
members
,
and
as
vehemently
denounced
by
the
Roman
Catholic
;
and
it
was
justly
considered
that
no
further
union
between
the
parties
would
be
possible
after
such
a
battle
.
<EOS>
The
innocent
Irish
fell
into
the
trap
as
they
always
do
,
and
whiskey
and
poplins
became
a
drug
in
the
market
.
  
<EOS>
A
florid
-
faced
gentleman
with
a
nice
head
of
hair
,
from
the
south
of
Ireland
,
had
succeeded
in
catching
the
speaker
's
eye
by
the
time
that
Mr
Harding
had
got
into
the
gallery
,
and
was
denouncing
the
proposed
sacrilege
,
his
whole
face
glowing
with
a
fine
theatrical
frenzy
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
this
is
a
Christian
country
?
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
(
Loud
cheers
;
counter
cheers
from
the
ministerial
benches
.
<EOS>
"
Some
doubt
as
to
that
,
"
from
a
voice
below
the
gangway
.
)
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
can
be
no
Christian
country
,
in
which
the
head
of
the
bar
,
the
lagal
adviser
(
loud
laughter
and
cheers
)
 
<EOS>
yes
,
I
say
the
lagal
adviser
of
the
crown
(
great
cheers
and
laughter
)
 
can
stand
up
in
his
seat
in
this
house
(
prolonged
cheers
and
laughter
)
,
and
attempt
to
lagalise
indacent
assaults
on
the
bodies
of
religious
ladies
.
"
<EOS>
(
Deafening
cheers
and
laughter
,
which
were
prolonged
till
the
honourable
member
resumed
his
seat
.
)
  
<EOS>
When
Mr
Harding
had
listened
to
this
and
much
more
of
the
same
kind
for
about
three
hours
,
he
returned
to
the
door
of
the
House
,
and
received
back
from
the
messenger
his
own
note
,
with
the
following
words
scrawled
in
pencil
on
the
back
of
it
:
"
To
-
morrow
,
10
P.M.
 
my
chambers
.
 
<EOS>
A.
H.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
so
far
successful
;
 
but
10
P.M.
:
<EOS>
what
an
hour
Sir
Abraham
had
named
for
a
legal
interview
!
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
felt
perfectly
sure
that
long
before
that
Dr
Grantly
would
be
in
London
.
<EOS>
Dr
Grantly
could
not
,
however
,
know
that
this
interview
had
been
arranged
,
nor
could
he
learn
it
unless
he
managed
to
get
hold
of
Sir
Abraham
before
that
hour
;
and
as
this
was
very
improbable
,
Mr
Harding
determined
to
start
from
his
hotel
early
,
merely
leaving
word
that
he
should
dine
out
,
and
unless
luck
were
much
against
him
,
he
might
still
escape
the
archdeacon
till
his
return
from
the
attorney
-
general
's
chambers
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
at
breakfast
at
nine
,
and
for
the
twentieth
time
consulted
his
Bradshaw
,
to
see
at
what
earliest
hour
Dr
Grantly
could
arrive
from
Barchester
.
<EOS>
As
he
examined
the
columns
,
he
was
nearly
petrified
by
the
reflection
that
perhaps
the
archdeacon
might
come
up
by
the
night
-
mail
train
!
<EOS>
His
heart
sank
within
him
at
the
horrid
idea
,
and
for
a
moment
he
felt
himself
dragged
back
to
Barchester
without
accomplishing
any
portion
of
his
object
.
<EOS>
Then
he
remembered
that
had
Dr
Grantly
done
so
<EOS>
,
he
would
have
been
in
the
hotel
,
looking
for
him
long
since
.
  
<EOS>
"
Waiter
,
"
said
he
,
timidly
.
  
<EOS>
The
waiter
approached
,
creaking
in
his
shoes
,
but
voiceless
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
any
gentleman
,
 
a
clergyman
,
arrive
here
by
the
night
-
mail
train
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
not
one
,
"
whispered
the
waiter
,
putting
his
mouth
nearly
close
to
the
warden
's
ear
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
was
reassured
.
  
<EOS>
"
Waiter
,
"
said
he
again
,
and
the
waiter
again
creaked
up
.
<EOS>
"
If
anyone
calls
for
me
,
I
am
going
to
dine
out
,
and
shall
return
about
eleven
o'clock
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
waiter
nodded
,
but
did
not
this
time
vouchsafe
any
reply
;
and
Mr
Harding
,
taking
up
his
hat
,
proceeded
out
to
pass
a
long
day
in
the
best
way
he
could
,
somewhere
out
of
sight
of
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
Bradshaw
had
told
him
twenty
times
that
Dr
Grantly
could
not
be
at
Paddington
station
till
2
P.M.
,
and
our
poor
friend
might
therefore
have
trusted
to
the
shelter
of
the
hotel
for
some
hours
longer
with
perfect
safety
;
but
he
was
nervous
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
knowing
what
steps
the
archdeacon
might
take
for
his
apprehension
:
a
message
by
electric
telegraph
might
desire
the
landlord
of
the
hotel
to
set
a
watch
upon
him
;
some
letter
might
come
which
he
might
find
himself
unable
to
disobey
;
at
any
rate
,
he
could
not
feel
himself
secure
in
any
place
at
which
the
archdeacon
could
expect
to
find
him
;
and
at
10
A.M.
he
started
forth
to
spend
twelve
hours
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
had
friends
in
town
had
he
chosen
to
seek
them
;
but
he
felt
that
he
was
in
no
humour
for
ordinary
calls
,
and
he
did
not
now
wish
to
consult
with
anyone
as
to
the
great
step
which
he
had
determined
to
take
.
<EOS>
As
he
had
said
to
his
daughter
,
no
one
knows
where
the
shoe
pinches
but
the
wearer
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
points
on
which
no
man
can
be
contented
to
follow
the
advice
of
another
,
 
some
subjects
on
which
a
man
can
consult
his
own
conscience
only
.
<EOS>
Our
warden
had
made
up
his
mind
that
it
was
good
for
him
at
any
cost
to
get
rid
of
this
grievance
;
his
daughter
was
the
only
person
whose
concurrence
appeared
necessary
to
him
,
and
she
did
concur
with
him
most
heartily
.
<EOS>
Under
such
circumstances
he
would
not
,
if
he
could
help
it
,
consult
anyone
further
,
till
advice
would
be
useless
.
<EOS>
Should
the
archdeacon
catch
him
,
indeed
,
there
would
be
much
advice
,
and
much
consultation
of
a
kind
not
to
be
avoided
;
but
he
hoped
better
things
;
and
as
he
felt
that
he
could
not
now
converse
on
indifferent
subjects
,
he
resolved
to
see
no
one
till
after
his
interview
with
the
attorney
-
general
.
  
<EOS>
He
determined
to
take
sanctuary
in
Westminster
Abbey
,
so
he
again
went
thither
in
an
omnibus
,
and
finding
that
the
doors
were
not
open
for
morning
service
,
he
paid
his
twopence
,
and
went
in
as
a
sightseer
.
<EOS>
It
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
no
definite
place
of
rest
for
the
day
,
and
that
he
should
be
absolutely
worn
out
before
his
interview
if
he
attempted
to
walk
about
from
10
A.M.
to
10
P.M.
,
so
he
sat
himself
down
on
a
stone
step
,
and
gazed
up
at
the
figure
of
William
Pitt
,
who
looks
as
though
he
had
just
entered
the
church
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
was
anything
but
pleased
at
finding
himself
there
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
sitting
unmolested
about
twenty
minutes
when
the
verger
asked
him
whether
he
would
n't
like
to
walk
round
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
did
n't
want
to
walk
anywhere
,
and
declined
,
merely
observing
that
he
was
waiting
for
the
morning
service
.
<EOS>
The
verger
,
seeing
that
he
was
a
clergyman
,
told
him
that
the
doors
of
the
choir
were
now
open
,
and
showed
him
into
a
seat
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
great
point
gained
;
the
archdeacon
would
certainly
not
come
to
morning
service
at
Westminster
Abbey
,
even
though
he
were
in
London
;
and
here
the
warden
could
rest
quietly
,
and
,
when
the
time
came
,
duly
say
his
prayers
.
  
<EOS>
He
longed
to
get
up
from
his
seat
,
and
examine
the
music
-
books
of
the
choristers
,
and
the
copy
of
the
litany
from
which
the
service
was
chanted
,
to
see
how
far
the
little
details
at
Westminster
corresponded
with
those
at
Barchester
,
and
whether
he
thought
his
own
voice
would
fill
the
church
well
from
the
Westminster
precentor
's
seat
.
<EOS>
There
would
,
however
,
be
impropriety
in
such
meddling
,
and
he
sat
perfectly
still
,
looking
up
at
the
noble
roof
,
and
guarding
against
the
coming
fatigues
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
By
degrees
two
or
three
people
entered
;
the
very
same
damp
old
woman
who
had
nearly
obliterated
him
in
the
omnibus
,
or
some
other
just
like
her
;
a
couple
of
young
ladies
with
their
veils
down
,
and
gilt
crosses
conspicuous
on
their
prayer
-
books
;
an
old
man
on
crutches
;
a
party
who
were
seeing
the
abbey
,
and
thought
they
might
as
well
hear
the
service
for
their
twopence
,
as
opportunity
served
;
and
a
young
woman
with
her
prayer
-
book
done
up
in
her
handkerchief
,
who
rushed
in
late
,
and
,
in
her
hurried
entry
,
tumbled
over
one
of
the
forms
,
and
made
such
a
noise
that
everyone
,
even
the
officiating
minor
canon
,
was
startled
,
and
she
herself
was
so
frightened
by
the
echo
of
her
own
catastrophe
that
she
was
nearly
thrown
into
fits
by
the
panic
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
was
not
much
edified
by
the
manner
of
the
service
.
<EOS>
The
minor
canon
in
question
hurried
in
,
somewhat
late
,
in
a
surplice
not
in
the
neatest
order
,
and
was
followed
by
a
dozen
choristers
,
who
were
also
not
as
trim
as
they
might
have
been
:
they
all
jostled
into
their
places
with
a
quick
hurried
step
,
and
the
service
was
soon
commenced
.
<EOS>
Soon
commenced
and
soon
over
,
 
for
there
was
no
music
,
and
time
was
not
unnecessarily
lost
in
the
chanting
.
<EOS>
On
the
whole
Mr
Harding
was
of
opinion
that
things
were
managed
better
at
Barchester
,
though
even
there
he
knew
that
there
was
room
for
improvement
.
  
<EOS>
It
appears
to
us
a
question
whether
any
clergyman
can
go
through
our
church
service
with
decorum
,
morning
after
morning
,
in
an
immense
building
,
surrounded
by
not
more
than
a
dozen
listeners
.
<EOS>
The
best
actors
can
not
act
well
before
empty
benches
,
and
though
there
is
,
of
course
,
a
higher
motive
in
one
case
than
the
other
,
still
even
the
best
of
clergymen
can
not
but
be
influenced
by
their
audience
;
and
to
expect
that
a
duty
should
be
well
done
under
such
circumstances
,
would
be
to
require
from
human
nature
more
than
human
power
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
two
ladies
with
the
gilt
crosses
,
the
old
man
with
his
crutch
,
and
the
still
palpitating
housemaid
were
going
,
Mr
Harding
found
himself
obliged
to
go
too
.
<EOS>
The
verger
stood
in
his
way
,
and
looked
at
him
and
looked
at
the
door
,
and
so
he
went
.
<EOS>
But
he
returned
again
in
a
few
minutes
,
and
re
-
entered
with
another
twopence
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
other
sanctuary
so
good
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
walked
slowly
down
the
nave
,
and
then
up
one
aisle
,
and
then
again
down
the
nave
and
up
the
other
aisle
,
he
tried
to
think
gravely
of
the
step
he
was
about
to
take
.
<EOS>
He
was
going
to
give
up
eight
hundred
a
year
voluntarily
;
and
doom
himself
to
live
for
the
rest
of
his
life
on
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
had
hitherto
failed
to
realise
this
fact
as
he
ought
to
do
.
<EOS>
Could
he
maintain
his
own
independence
and
support
his
daughter
on
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
without
being
a
burden
on
anyone
?
<EOS>
His
son
-
in
-
law
was
rich
,
but
nothing
could
induce
him
to
lean
on
his
son
-
in
-
law
after
acting
,
as
he
intended
to
do
,
in
direct
opposition
to
his
son
-
in
-
law
's
counsel
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
was
rich
,
but
he
was
about
to
throw
away
the
bishop
's
best
gift
,
and
that
in
a
manner
to
injure
materially
the
patronage
of
the
giver
<EOS>
:
he
could
neither
expect
nor
accept
anything
further
from
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
There
would
be
not
only
no
merit
,
but
positive
disgrace
,
in
giving
up
his
wardenship
,
if
he
were
not
prepared
to
meet
the
world
without
it
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
he
must
from
this
time
forward
bound
all
his
human
wishes
for
himself
and
his
daughter
to
the
poor
extent
of
so
limited
an
income
.
<EOS>
He
knew
he
had
not
thought
sufficiently
of
this
,
that
he
had
been
carried
away
by
enthusiasm
,
and
had
hitherto
not
brought
home
to
himself
the
full
reality
of
his
position
.
  
<EOS>
He
thought
most
about
his
daughter
,
naturally
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
that
she
was
engaged
,
and
he
knew
enough
of
his
proposed
son
-
in
-
law
to
be
sure
that
his
own
altered
circumstances
would
make
no
obstacle
to
such
a
marriage
;
nay
,
he
was
sure
that
the
very
fact
of
his
poverty
would
induce
Bold
more
anxiously
to
press
the
matter
;
but
he
disliked
counting
on
Bold
in
this
emergency
,
brought
on
,
as
it
had
been
,
by
his
doing
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
like
saying
to
himself
,
Bold
has
turned
me
out
of
my
house
and
income
,
and
,
therefore
,
he
must
relieve
me
of
my
daughter
;
he
preferred
reckoning
on
Eleanor
as
the
companion
of
his
poverty
and
exile
,
 
as
the
sharer
of
his
small
income
.
  
<EOS>
Some
modest
provision
for
his
daughter
had
been
long
since
made
.
<EOS>
His
life
was
insured
for
three
thousand
pounds
,
and
this
sum
was
to
go
to
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
,
for
some
years
past
,
had
paid
the
premium
,
and
had
secured
himself
by
the
immediate
possession
of
a
small
property
which
was
to
have
gone
to
Mrs
Grantly
after
her
father
's
death
.
<EOS>
This
matter
,
therefore
,
had
been
taken
out
of
the
warden
's
hands
long
since
,
as
,
indeed
,
had
all
the
business
transactions
of
his
family
,
and
his
anxiety
was
,
therefore
,
confined
to
his
own
life
income
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
A
hundred
and
fifty
per
annum
was
very
small
,
but
still
it
might
suffice
;
but
how
was
he
to
chant
the
litany
at
the
cathedral
on
Sunday
mornings
,
and
get
the
service
done
at
Crabtree
Parva
?
<EOS>
True
,
Crabtree
Church
was
not
quite
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
cathedral
;
but
he
could
not
be
in
two
places
at
once
.
<EOS>
Crabtree
was
a
small
village
,
and
afternoon
service
might
suffice
,
but
still
this
went
against
his
conscience
;
it
was
not
right
that
his
parishioners
should
be
robbed
of
any
of
their
privileges
on
account
of
his
poverty
.
<EOS>
He
might
,
to
be
sure
,
make
some
arrangements
for
doing
week
-
day
service
at
the
cathedral
;
but
he
had
chanted
the
litany
at
Barchester
so
long
,
and
had
a
conscious
feeling
that
he
did
it
so
well
,
that
he
was
unwilling
to
give
up
the
duty
.
  
<EOS>
Thinking
of
such
things
,
turning
over
in
his
own
mind
together
small
desires
and
grave
duties
,
but
never
hesitating
for
a
moment
as
to
the
necessity
of
leaving
the
hospital
<EOS>
,
Mr
Harding
walked
up
and
down
the
abbey
,
or
sat
still
meditating
on
the
same
stone
step
,
hour
after
hour
.
<EOS>
One
verger
went
and
another
came
,
but
they
did
not
disturb
him
;
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
they
crept
up
and
looked
at
him
,
but
they
did
so
with
a
reverential
stare
,
and
,
on
the
whole
,
Mr
Harding
found
his
retreat
well
chosen
.
<EOS>
About
four
o'clock
his
comfort
was
disturbed
by
an
enemy
in
the
shape
of
hunger
.
<EOS>
It
was
necessary
that
he
should
dine
,
and
it
was
clear
that
he
could
not
dine
in
the
abbey
:
so
he
left
his
sanctuary
not
willingly
,
and
betook
himself
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
Strand
to
look
for
food
.
  
<EOS>
His
eyes
had
become
so
accustomed
to
the
gloom
of
the
church
,
that
they
were
dazed
when
he
got
out
into
the
full
light
of
day
,
and
he
felt
confused
and
ashamed
of
himself
,
as
though
people
were
staring
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
hurried
along
,
still
in
dread
of
the
archdeacon
,
till
he
came
to
Charing
Cross
,
and
then
remembered
that
in
one
of
his
passages
through
the
Strand
he
had
seen
the
words
"
Chops
and
Steaks
"
on
a
placard
in
a
shop
window
.
<EOS>
He
remembered
the
shop
distinctly
;
it
was
next
door
to
a
trunk
-
seller
's
,
and
there
was
a
cigar
shop
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
He
could
n't
go
to
his
hotel
for
dinner
,
which
to
him
hitherto
<EOS>
was
the
only
known
mode
of
dining
in
London
at
his
own
expense
;
and
,
therefore
,
he
would
get
a
steak
at
the
shop
in
the
Strand
.
<EOS>
Archdeacon
Grantly
would
certainly
not
come
to
such
a
place
for
his
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
He
found
the
house
easily
,
 
just
as
he
had
observed
it
,
between
the
trunks
and
the
cigars
.
<EOS>
He
was
rather
daunted
by
the
huge
quantity
of
fish
which
he
saw
in
the
window
.
<EOS>
There
were
barrels
of
oysters
,
hecatombs
of
lobsters
,
a
few
tremendous
-
looking
crabs
,
and
a
tub
full
of
pickled
salmon
;
not
,
however
,
being
aware
of
any
connection
between
shell
-
fish
and
iniquity
,
he
entered
,
and
modestly
asked
a
slatternly
woman
,
who
was
picking
oysters
out
of
a
great
watery
reservoir
,
whether
he
could
have
a
mutton
chop
and
a
potato
.
  
<EOS>
The
woman
looked
somewhat
surprised
,
but
answered
in
the
affirmative
,
and
a
slipshod
girl
ushered
him
into
a
long
back
room
,
filled
with
boxes
for
the
accommodation
of
parties
,
in
one
of
which
he
took
his
seat
.
<EOS>
In
a
more
miserably
forlorn
place
he
could
not
have
found
himself
:
the
room
smelt
of
fish
,
and
sawdust
,
and
stale
tobacco
smoke
,
with
a
slight
taint
of
escaped
gas
;
everything
was
rough
and
dirty
,
and
disreputable
;
the
cloth
which
they
put
before
him
was
abominable
;
the
knives
and
forks
were
bruised
,
and
hacked
,
and
filthy
;
and
everything
was
impregnated
with
fish
.
<EOS>
He
had
one
comfort
,
however
:
he
was
quite
alone
;
there
was
no
one
there
to
look
on
his
dismay
;
nor
was
it
probable
that
anyone
would
come
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
London
supper
-
house
.
<EOS>
About
one
o'clock
at
night
the
place
would
be
lively
enough
,
but
at
the
present
time
his
seclusion
was
as
deep
as
it
had
been
in
the
abbey
.
  
<EOS>
In
about
half
an
hour
the
untidy
girl
,
not
yet
dressed
for
her
evening
labours
,
brought
him
his
chop
and
potatoes
,
and
Mr
Harding
begged
for
a
pint
of
sherry
.
<EOS>
He
was
impressed
with
an
idea
,
which
was
generally
prevalent
a
few
years
since
,
and
is
not
yet
wholly
removed
from
the
minds
of
men
,
that
to
order
a
dinner
at
any
kind
of
inn
,
without
also
ordering
a
pint
of
wine
for
the
benefit
of
the
landlord
,
was
a
kind
of
fraud
,
 
not
punishable
,
indeed
,
by
law
,
but
not
the
less
abominable
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
remembered
his
coming
poverty
,
and
would
willingly
have
saved
his
half
-
crown
,
but
he
thought
he
had
no
alternative
;
and
he
was
soon
put
in
possession
of
some
horrid
mixture
procured
from
the
neighbouring
public
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
His
chop
and
potatoes
,
however
,
were
eatable
,
and
having
got
over
as
best
<EOS>
he
might
the
disgust
created
by
the
knives
and
forks
,
he
contrived
to
swallow
his
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
much
disturbed
:
<EOS>
one
young
man
,
with
pale
face
and
watery
fishlike
eyes
,
wearing
his
hat
ominously
on
one
side
,
did
come
in
and
stare
at
him
,
and
ask
the
girl
,
audibly
enough
,
"
Who
that
old
cock
was
;
"
but
the
annoyance
went
no
further
,
and
the
warden
was
left
seated
on
his
wooden
bench
in
peace
,
endeavouring
to
distinguish
the
different
scents
arising
from
lobsters
,
oysters
,
and
salmon
.
  
<EOS>
Unknowing
as
Mr
Harding
was
in
the
ways
of
London
<EOS>
,
he
felt
that
he
had
somehow
selected
an
ineligible
dining
-
house
,
and
that
he
had
better
leave
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
hardly
five
o'clock
;
 
how
was
he
to
pass
the
time
till
ten
?
<EOS>
Five
miserable
hours
!
<EOS>
He
was
already
tired
,
and
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
continue
walking
so
long
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
getting
into
an
omnibus
,
and
going
out
to
Fulham
for
the
sake
of
coming
back
in
another
:
this
,
however
,
would
be
weary
work
,
and
as
he
paid
his
bill
to
the
woman
in
the
shop
,
he
asked
her
if
there
were
any
place
near
where
he
could
get
a
cup
of
coffee
.
<EOS>
Though
she
did
keep
a
shellfish
supper
-
house
,
she
was
very
civil
,
and
directed
him
to
the
cigar
divan
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
had
not
a
much
correcter
notion
of
a
cigar
divan
than
he
had
of
a
London
dinner
-
house
,
but
he
was
desperately
in
want
of
rest
,
and
went
as
he
was
directed
.
<EOS>
He
thought
he
must
have
made
some
mistake
when
he
found
himself
in
a
cigar
shop
,
but
the
man
behind
the
counter
saw
immediately
that
he
was
a
stranger
,
and
understood
what
he
wanted
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
One
shilling
,
sir
,
 
thank
ye
,
sir
,
 
cigar
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
ticket
for
coffee
,
sir
;
 
<EOS>
you
'll
only
have
to
call
the
waiter
.
<EOS>
Up
those
stairs
,
if
you
please
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Better
take
the
cigar
,
sir
,
 
you
can
always
give
it
to
a
friend
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
thank
ye
,
sir
;
 
as
you
are
so
good
,
I
'll
smoke
it
myself
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
Mr
Harding
ascended
to
the
divan
,
with
his
ticket
for
coffee
,
but
minus
the
cigar
.
  
<EOS>
The
place
seemed
much
more
suitable
to
his
requirements
than
the
room
in
which
he
had
dined
:
there
was
,
to
be
sure
,
a
strong
smell
of
tobacco
,
to
which
he
was
not
accustomed
;
but
after
the
shell
-
fish
,
the
tobacco
did
not
seem
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
There
were
quantities
of
books
,
and
long
rows
of
sofas
.
<EOS>
What
on
earth
could
be
more
luxurious
than
a
sofa
,
a
book
,
and
a
cup
of
coffee
?
<EOS>
An
old
waiter
came
up
to
him
,
with
a
couple
of
magazines
and
an
evening
paper
.
<EOS>
Was
ever
anything
so
civil
?
<EOS>
Would
he
have
a
cup
of
coffee
,
or
would
he
prefer
sherbet
?
<EOS>
Sherbet
!
<EOS>
Was
he
absolutely
in
an
Eastern
divan
,
with
the
slight
addition
of
all
the
London
periodicals
?
<EOS>
He
had
,
however
,
an
idea
that
sherbet
should
be
drunk
sitting
cross
-
legged
,
and
as
he
was
not
quite
up
to
this
,
he
ordered
the
coffee
.
  
<EOS>
The
coffee
came
,
and
was
unexceptionable
.
<EOS>
Why
,
this
divan
was
a
paradise
!
<EOS>
The
civil
old
waiter
suggested
to
him
a
game
of
chess
:
though
a
chess
player
he
was
not
equal
to
this
,
so
he
declined
,
and
,
putting
up
his
weary
legs
on
the
sofa
,
leisurely
sipped
his
coffee
,
and
turned
over
the
pages
of
his
Blackwood
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
been
so
engaged
for
about
an
hour
,
for
the
old
waiter
<EOS>
enticed
him
to
a
second
cup
of
coffee
,
when
a
musical
clock
began
to
play
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
then
closed
his
magazine
,
keeping
his
place
with
his
finger
,
and
lay
,
listening
with
closed
eyes
to
the
clock
.
<EOS>
Soon
the
clock
seemed
to
turn
into
a
violoncello
,
with
piano
accompaniments
,
and
Mr
Harding
began
to
fancy
the
old
waiter
<EOS>
was
the
Bishop
of
Barchester
;
he
was
inexpressibly
shocked
that
the
bishop
should
have
brought
him
his
coffee
with
his
own
hands
;
then
Dr
Grantly
came
in
,
with
a
basket
full
of
lobsters
,
which
he
would
not
be
induced
to
leave
downstairs
in
the
kitchen
;
and
then
the
warden
could
n't
quite
understand
why
so
many
people
would
smoke
in
the
bishop
's
drawing
-
room
;
and
so
he
fell
fast
asleep
,
and
his
dreams
wandered
away
to
his
accustomed
stall
in
Barchester
Cathedral
,
and
the
twelve
old
men
he
was
so
soon
about
to
leave
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
fatigued
,
and
slept
soundly
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
Some
sudden
stop
in
the
musical
clock
woke
him
at
length
,
and
he
jumped
up
with
a
start
,
surprised
to
find
the
room
quite
full
:
it
had
been
nearly
empty
when
his
nap
began
.
<EOS>
With
nervous
anxiety
he
pulled
out
his
watch
,
and
found
that
it
was
half
-
past
nine
.
<EOS>
He
seized
his
hat
,
and
,
hurrying
downstairs
,
started
at
a
rapid
pace
for
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
  
<EOS>
It
still
wanted
twenty
minutes
to
ten
when
the
warden
found
himself
at
the
bottom
of
Sir
Abraham
's
stairs
,
so
he
walked
leisurely
up
and
down
the
quiet
inn
to
cool
himself
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
beautiful
evening
at
the
end
of
August
.
<EOS>
He
had
recovered
from
his
fatigue
;
his
sleep
and
the
coffee
had
refreshed
him
,
and
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
was
absolutely
enjoying
himself
,
when
the
inn
clock
struck
ten
.
<EOS>
The
sound
was
hardly
over
before
he
knocked
at
Sir
Abraham
's
door
,
and
was
informed
by
the
clerk
who
received
him
that
the
great
man
would
be
with
him
immediately
.
   
<EOS>
SIR
ABRAHAM
HAPHAZARD
 
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
was
shown
into
a
comfortable
inner
sitting
-
room
,
looking
more
like
a
gentleman
's
book
-
room
than
a
lawyer
's
chambers
,
and
there
waited
for
Sir
Abraham
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
kept
waiting
long
:
in
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
he
heard
a
clatter
of
voices
speaking
quickly
in
the
passage
,
and
then
the
attorney
-
general
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
sorry
to
keep
you
waiting
,
Mr
Warden
,
"
said
Sir
Abraham
,
shaking
hands
with
him
;
"
and
sorry
,
too
,
to
name
so
disagreeable
an
hour
;
but
your
notice
was
short
,
and
as
you
said
to
-
day
,
I
named
the
very
earliest
hour
that
was
not
disposed
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
assured
him
that
he
was
aware
that
it
was
he
that
should
apologise
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Abraham
was
a
tall
thin
man
,
with
hair
prematurely
gray
,
but
bearing
no
other
sign
of
age
;
he
had
a
slight
stoop
,
in
his
neck
rather
than
his
back
,
acquired
by
his
constant
habit
of
leaning
forward
as
he
addressed
his
various
audiences
.
<EOS>
He
might
be
fifty
years
old
,
and
would
have
looked
young
for
his
age
,
had
not
constant
work
hardened
his
features
,
and
given
him
the
appearance
of
a
machine
with
a
mind
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
full
of
intellect
,
but
devoid
of
natural
expression
.
<EOS>
You
would
say
he
was
a
man
to
use
,
and
then
have
done
with
;
a
man
to
be
sought
for
on
great
emergencies
,
but
ill
-
adapted
for
ordinary
services
;
a
man
whom
you
would
ask
to
defend
your
property
,
but
to
whom
you
would
be
sorry
to
confide
your
love
.
<EOS>
He
was
bright
as
a
diamond
,
and
as
cutting
,
and
also
as
unimpressionable
.
<EOS>
He
knew
everyone
whom
to
know
was
an
honour
,
but
he
was
without
a
friend
;
he
wanted
none
,
however
,
and
knew
not
the
meaning
of
the
word
in
other
than
its
parliamentary
sense
.
<EOS>
A
friend
!
<EOS>
Had
he
not
always
been
sufficient
to
himself
,
and
now
,
at
fifty
,
was
it
likely
that
he
should
trust
another
?
<EOS>
He
was
married
,
indeed
,
and
had
children
,
but
what
time
had
he
for
the
soft
idleness
of
conjugal
felicity
?
<EOS>
His
working
days
or
term
times
were
occupied
from
his
time
of
rising
to
the
late
hour
at
which
he
went
to
rest
,
and
even
his
vacations
were
more
full
of
labour
than
the
busiest
days
of
other
men
.
<EOS>
He
never
quarrelled
with
his
wife
,
but
he
never
talked
to
her
;
 
he
never
had
time
to
talk
,
he
was
so
taken
up
with
speaking
.
<EOS>
She
,
poor
lady
,
was
not
unhappy
;
she
had
all
that
money
could
give
her
,
she
would
probably
live
to
be
a
peeress
,
and
she
really
thought
Sir
Abraham
the
best
of
husbands
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Abraham
was
a
man
of
wit
,
and
sparkled
among
the
brightest
at
the
dinner
-
tables
of
political
grandees
:
indeed
,
he
always
sparkled
;
whether
in
society
,
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
or
the
courts
of
law
,
coruscations
flew
from
him
;
glittering
sparkles
,
as
from
hot
steel
,
but
no
heat
;
no
cold
heart
was
ever
cheered
by
warmth
from
him
,
no
unhappy
soul
ever
dropped
a
portion
of
its
burden
at
his
door
.
  
<EOS>
With
him
success
alone
was
praiseworthy
,
and
he
knew
none
so
successful
as
himself
.
<EOS>
No
one
had
thrust
him
forward
;
no
powerful
friends
had
pushed
him
along
on
his
road
to
power
.
<EOS>
No
;
he
was
attorney
-
general
,
and
would
,
in
all
human
probability
,
be
lord
chancellor
by
sheer
dint
of
his
own
industry
and
his
own
talent
.
<EOS>
Who
else
in
all
the
world
rose
so
high
with
so
little
help
?
<EOS>
A
premier
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Who
had
ever
been
premier
without
mighty
friends
?
<EOS>
An
archbishop
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
the
son
or
grandson
of
a
great
noble
,
or
else
,
probably
,
his
tutor
.
<EOS>
But
he
,
Sir
Abraham
,
had
had
no
mighty
lord
at
his
back
;
his
father
had
been
a
country
apothecary
,
his
mother
a
farmer
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
respect
any
but
himself
?
<EOS>
And
so
he
glitters
along
through
the
world
,
the
brightest
among
the
bright
;
and
when
his
glitter
is
gone
,
and
he
is
gathered
to
his
fathers
,
no
eye
will
be
dim
with
a
tear
<EOS>
,
no
heart
will
mourn
for
its
lost
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
Mr
Warden
,
"
said
Sir
Abraham
,
"
all
our
trouble
about
this
lawsuit
is
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
said
he
hoped
so
,
but
he
did
n't
at
all
understand
what
Sir
Abraham
meant
.
<EOS>
Sir
Abraham
,
with
all
his
sharpness
,
could
not
have
looked
into
his
heart
and
read
his
intentions
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
over
.
<EOS>
You
need
trouble
yourself
no
further
about
it
;
of
course
they
must
pay
the
costs
,
and
the
absolute
expense
to
you
and
Dr
Grantly
will
be
trifling
,
 
that
is
,
compared
with
what
it
might
have
been
if
it
had
been
continued
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
do
n't
quite
understand
you
,
Sir
Abraham
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
you
know
that
their
attorneys
have
noticed
us
that
they
have
withdrawn
the
suit
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
explained
to
the
lawyer
that
he
knew
nothing
of
this
,
although
he
had
heard
in
a
roundabout
way
that
such
an
intention
had
been
talked
of
;
and
he
also
at
length
succeeded
in
making
Sir
Abraham
understand
that
even
this
did
not
satisfy
him
.
<EOS>
The
attorney
-
general
stood
up
,
put
his
hands
into
his
breeches
'
pockets
,
and
raised
his
eyebrows
,
as
Mr
Harding
proceeded
to
detail
the
grievance
from
which
he
now
wished
to
rid
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
have
no
right
to
trouble
you
personally
with
this
matter
,
but
as
it
is
of
most
vital
importance
to
me
,
as
all
my
happiness
is
concerned
in
it
,
I
thought
I
might
venture
to
seek
your
advice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Abraham
bowed
,
and
declared
his
clients
were
entitled
to
the
best
advice
he
could
give
them
;
particularly
a
client
so
respectable
in
every
way
as
the
Warden
of
Barchester
Hospital
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
spoken
word
,
Sir
Abraham
,
is
often
of
more
value
than
volumes
of
written
advice
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
I
am
ill
-
satisfied
with
this
matter
as
it
stands
at
present
.
<EOS>
I
do
see
 
I
can
not
help
seeing
,
that
the
affairs
of
the
hospital
are
not
arranged
according
to
the
will
of
the
founder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
of
such
institutions
are
,
Mr
Harding
,
nor
can
they
be
;
the
altered
circumstances
in
which
we
live
do
not
admit
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
true
 
that
is
quite
true
;
but
I
ca
n't
see
that
those
altered
circumstances
give
me
a
right
to
eight
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
ever
read
John
Hiram
's
will
,
but
were
I
to
read
it
now
<EOS>
I
could
not
understand
it
.
<EOS>
What
I
want
you
,
Sir
Abraham
,
to
tell
me
,
is
this
:
 
am
I
,
as
warden
,
legally
and
distinctly
entitled
to
the
proceeds
of
the
property
,
after
the
due
maintenance
of
the
twelve
bedesmen
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Abraham
declared
that
he
could
n't
exactly
say
in
so
many
words
that
Mr
Harding
was
legally
entitled
to
,
&
c.
,
&
c.
,
&
c.
,
and
ended
in
expressing
a
strong
opinion
that
it
would
be
madness
to
raise
any
further
question
on
the
matter
,
as
the
suit
was
to
be
,
 
nay
,
was
,
abandoned
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
,
seated
in
his
chair
,
began
to
play
a
slow
tune
on
an
imaginary
violoncello
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
continued
the
attorney
-
general
,
"
there
is
no
further
ground
for
any
question
;
I
do
n't
see
that
you
have
the
power
of
raising
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
resign
,
"
said
Mr
Harding
,
slowly
playing
away
with
his
right
hand
,
as
though
the
bow
were
beneath
the
chair
in
which
he
was
sitting
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
throw
it
up
altogether
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
attorney
-
general
,
gazing
with
utter
astonishment
at
his
client
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
see
those
articles
in
_
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
_
?
"
said
Mr
Harding
,
piteously
,
appealing
to
the
sympathy
of
the
lawyer
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Abraham
said
he
had
seen
them
.
<EOS>
This
poor
little
clergyman
,
cowed
into
such
an
act
of
extreme
weakness
by
a
newspaper
article
,
was
to
Sir
Abraham
so
contemptible
an
object
,
that
he
hardly
knew
how
to
talk
to
him
as
to
a
rational
being
.
  
<EOS>
"
Had
n't
you
better
wait
,
"
said
he
,
"
till
Dr
Grantly
is
in
town
with
you
?
<EOS>
Would
n't
it
be
better
to
postpone
any
serious
step
till
you
can
consult
with
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
declared
vehemently
that
he
could
not
wait
,
and
Sir
Abraham
began
seriously
to
doubt
his
sanity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
said
the
latter
,
"
if
you
have
private
means
sufficient
for
your
wants
,
and
if
this
 
"
  
"
I
have
n't
a
sixpence
,
Sir
Abraham
,
"
said
the
warden
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
me
!
<EOS>
Why
,
Mr
Harding
,
how
do
you
mean
to
live
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
proceeded
to
explain
to
the
man
of
law
that
he
meant
to
keep
his
precentorship
,
 
that
was
eighty
pounds
a
year
;
and
,
also
,
that
he
meant
to
fall
back
upon
his
own
little
living
of
Crabtree
,
which
was
another
eighty
pounds
.
<EOS>
That
,
to
be
sure
,
the
duties
of
the
two
were
hardly
compatible
;
but
perhaps
he
might
effect
an
exchange
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
recollecting
that
the
attorney
-
general
would
hardly
care
to
hear
how
the
service
of
a
cathedral
church
is
divided
among
the
minor
canons
,
stopped
short
in
his
explanations
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Abraham
listened
in
pitying
wonder
.
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
,
Mr
Harding
,
you
had
better
wait
for
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
most
serious
step
,
 
one
for
which
,
in
my
opinion
,
there
is
not
the
slightest
necessity
;
and
,
as
you
have
done
me
the
honour
of
asking
my
advice
,
I
must
implore
you
to
do
nothing
without
the
approval
of
your
friends
.
<EOS>
A
man
is
never
the
best
judge
of
his
own
position
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
man
is
the
best
judge
of
what
he
feels
himself
.
<EOS>
I
'd
sooner
beg
my
bread
till
my
death
than
read
such
another
article
as
those
two
that
have
appeared
,
and
feel
,
as
I
do
,
that
the
writer
has
truth
on
his
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
not
a
daughter
,
Mr
Harding
 
an
unmarried
daughter
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
said
he
,
now
standing
also
,
but
still
playing
away
on
his
fiddle
with
his
hand
behind
his
back
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
Sir
Abraham
;
and
she
and
I
are
completely
agreed
on
this
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Pray
excuse
me
,
Mr
Harding
,
if
what
I
say
seems
impertinent
;
but
surely
it
is
you
that
should
be
prudent
on
her
behalf
.
<EOS>
She
is
young
,
and
does
not
know
the
meaning
of
living
on
an
income
of
a
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
a
year
.
<EOS>
On
her
account
give
up
this
idea
.
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
it
is
sheer
Quixotism
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
warden
walked
away
to
the
window
,
and
then
back
to
his
chair
;
and
then
,
irresolute
what
to
say
,
took
another
turn
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
The
attorney
-
general
was
really
extremely
patient
,
but
he
was
beginning
to
think
that
the
interview
had
been
long
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
this
income
be
not
justly
mine
,
what
if
she
and
I
have
both
to
beg
?
"
said
the
warden
at
last
,
sharply
,
and
in
a
voice
so
different
from
that
he
had
hitherto
used
,
that
Sir
Abraham
was
startled
.
<EOS>
"
If
so
,
it
would
be
better
to
beg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sir
,
nobody
now
questions
its
justness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Sir
Abraham
,
one
does
question
it
,
 
the
most
important
of
all
witnesses
against
me
;
 
I
question
it
myself
.
<EOS>
My
God
knows
whether
or
no
I
love
my
daughter
;
but
I
would
sooner
that
she
and
I
should
both
beg
,
than
that
she
should
live
in
comfort
on
money
which
is
truly
the
property
of
the
poor
.
<EOS>
It
may
seem
strange
to
you
,
Sir
Abraham
,
it
is
strange
to
myself
,
that
I
should
have
been
ten
years
in
that
happy
home
,
and
not
have
thought
of
these
things
till
they
were
so
roughly
dinned
into
my
ears
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
boast
of
my
conscience
,
when
it
required
the
violence
of
a
public
newspaper
to
awaken
it
;
but
,
now
that
it
is
awake
,
I
must
obey
it
.
<EOS>
When
I
came
here
,
I
did
not
know
that
the
suit
was
withdrawn
by
Mr
Bold
,
and
my
object
was
to
beg
you
to
abandon
my
defence
.
<EOS>
As
there
is
no
action
,
there
can
be
no
defence
;
but
it
is
,
at
any
rate
,
as
well
that
you
should
know
that
from
to
-
morrow
I
shall
cease
to
be
the
warden
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
My
friends
and
I
differ
on
this
subject
,
Sir
Abraham
,
and
that
adds
much
to
my
sorrow
;
but
it
can
not
be
helped
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
as
he
finished
what
he
had
to
say
,
he
played
up
such
a
tune
as
never
before
had
graced
the
chambers
of
any
attorney
-
general
.
<EOS>
He
was
standing
up
,
gallantly
fronting
Sir
Abraham
,
and
his
right
arm
passed
with
bold
and
rapid
sweeps
before
him
,
as
though
he
were
embracing
some
huge
instrument
,
which
allowed
him
to
stand
thus
erect
;
and
with
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
he
stopped
,
with
preternatural
velocity
,
a
multitude
of
strings
,
which
ranged
from
the
top
of
his
collar
to
the
bottom
of
the
lappet
of
his
coat
.
<EOS>
Sir
Abraham
listened
and
looked
in
wonder
.
<EOS>
As
he
had
never
before
seen
Mr
Harding
,
the
meaning
of
these
wild
gesticulations
was
lost
upon
him
;
but
he
perceived
that
the
gentleman
who
had
a
few
minutes
since
been
so
subdued
as
to
be
unable
to
speak
without
hesitation
,
was
now
impassioned
,
 
nay
,
almost
violent
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
sleep
on
this
,
Mr
Harding
,
and
to
-
morrow
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
have
done
more
than
sleep
upon
it
,
"
said
the
warden
;
"
I
have
lain
awake
upon
it
,
and
that
night
after
night
.
<EOS>
I
found
I
could
not
sleep
upon
it
:
now
I
hope
to
do
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
attorney
-
general
had
no
answer
to
make
to
this
;
so
he
expressed
a
quiet
hope
that
whatever
settlement
was
finally
made
would
be
satisfactory
;
and
Mr
Harding
withdrew
,
thanking
the
great
man
for
his
kind
attention
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
was
sufficiently
satisfied
with
the
interview
to
feel
a
glow
of
comfort
as
he
descended
into
the
small
old
square
of
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
calm
,
bright
,
beautiful
night
,
and
by
the
light
of
the
moon
,
even
the
chapel
of
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
and
the
sombre
row
of
chambers
,
which
surround
the
quadrangle
,
looked
well
.
<EOS>
He
stood
still
a
moment
to
collect
his
thoughts
,
and
reflect
on
what
he
had
done
,
and
was
about
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
the
attorney
-
general
regarded
him
as
little
better
than
a
fool
,
but
that
he
did
not
mind
;
he
and
the
attorney
-
general
had
not
much
in
common
between
them
;
he
knew
also
that
others
,
whom
he
did
care
about
,
would
think
so
too
;
but
Eleanor
,
he
was
sure
,
would
exult
in
what
he
had
done
,
and
the
bishop
,
he
trusted
,
would
sympathise
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
he
had
to
meet
the
archdeacon
,
and
so
he
walked
slowly
down
Chancery
Lane
and
along
Fleet
Street
,
feeling
sure
that
his
work
for
the
night
was
not
yet
over
.
<EOS>
When
he
reached
the
hotel
he
rang
the
bell
quietly
,
and
with
a
palpitating
heart
;
he
almost
longed
to
escape
round
the
corner
,
and
delay
the
coming
storm
by
a
further
walk
round
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
but
he
heard
the
slow
creaking
shoes
of
the
old
waiter
approaching
,
and
he
stood
his
ground
manfully
.
   
<EOS>
THE
WARDEN
IS
VERY
OBSTINATE
 
<EOS>
"
Dr
Grantly
is
here
,
sir
,
"
greeted
his
ears
before
the
door
was
well
open
,
"
and
Mrs
Grantly
.
<EOS>
They
have
a
sitting
-
room
above
,
and
are
waiting
up
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
the
tone
of
the
man
's
voice
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
even
he
looked
upon
the
warden
as
a
runaway
schoolboy
,
just
recaptured
by
his
guardian
,
and
that
he
pitied
the
culprit
,
though
he
could
not
but
be
horrified
at
the
crime
.
  
<EOS>
The
warden
endeavoured
to
appear
unconcerned
,
as
he
said
,
"
Oh
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
'll
go
upstairs
at
once
;
"
but
he
failed
signally
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
perhaps
,
a
ray
of
comfort
in
the
presence
of
his
married
daughter
;
that
is
to
say
,
of
comparative
comfort
,
seeing
that
his
son
-
in
-
law
was
there
;
but
how
much
would
he
have
preferred
that
they
should
both
have
been
safe
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
!
<EOS>
However
,
upstairs
he
went
,
the
waiter
slowly
preceding
him
;
and
on
the
door
being
opened
the
archdeacon
was
discovered
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
erect
,
indeed
,
as
usual
,
but
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
sorrowful
!
<EOS>
and
on
the
dingy
sofa
behind
him
reclined
his
patient
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
I
thought
you
were
never
coming
back
,
"
said
the
lady
;
"
it
's
twelve
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
warden
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
attorney
-
general
named
ten
for
my
meeting
;
to
be
sure
ten
is
late
,
but
what
could
I
do
,
you
know
?
<EOS>
Great
men
will
have
their
own
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
he
gave
his
daughter
a
kiss
,
and
shook
hands
with
the
doctor
,
and
again
tried
to
look
unconcerned
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
absolutely
been
with
the
attorney
-
general
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
signified
that
he
had
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
heavens
,
how
unfortunate
!
"
<EOS>
And
the
archdeacon
raised
his
huge
hands
in
the
manner
in
which
his
friends
are
so
accustomed
to
see
him
express
disapprobation
and
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
What
will
Sir
Abraham
think
of
it
?
<EOS>
Did
you
not
know
that
it
is
not
customary
for
clients
to
go
direct
to
their
counsel
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
it
?
"
asked
the
warden
,
innocently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
at
any
rate
,
I
've
done
it
now
.
<EOS>
Sir
Abraham
did
n't
seem
to
think
it
so
very
strange
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
gave
a
sigh
that
would
have
moved
a
man
-
of
-
war
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
papa
,
what
did
you
say
to
Sir
Abraham
?
"
asked
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
asked
him
,
my
dear
,
to
explain
John
Hiram
's
will
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
could
n't
explain
it
in
the
only
way
which
would
have
satisfied
me
,
and
so
I
resigned
the
wardenship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Resigned
it
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
archdeacon
,
in
a
solemn
voice
,
sad
and
low
,
but
yet
sufficiently
audible
,
 
a
sort
of
whisper
that
Macready
would
have
envied
,
and
<EOS>
the
galleries
have
applauded
with
a
couple
of
rounds
.
<EOS>
"
Resigned
it
!
<EOS>
Good
heavens
!
"
<EOS>
And
the
dignitary
of
the
church
sank
back
horrified
into
a
horsehair
arm
-
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
least
I
told
Sir
Abraham
that
I
would
resign
;
and
of
course
I
must
now
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
catching
a
ray
of
hope
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
that
you
say
in
such
a
way
to
your
own
counsel
can
be
in
any
way
binding
on
you
;
of
course
you
were
there
to
ask
his
advice
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
Sir
Abraham
did
not
advise
any
such
step
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
could
not
say
that
he
had
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
he
disadvised
you
from
it
,
"
continued
the
reverend
cross
-
examiner
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
could
not
deny
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
Sir
Abraham
must
have
advised
you
to
consult
your
friends
.
"
  
<EOS>
To
this
proposition
also
Mr
Harding
was
obliged
to
assent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
your
threat
of
resignation
amounts
to
nothing
,
and
we
are
just
where
we
were
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
was
now
standing
on
the
rug
,
moving
uneasily
from
one
foot
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
distinct
answer
to
the
archdeacon
's
last
proposition
,
for
his
mind
was
chiefly
engaged
on
thinking
how
he
could
escape
to
bed
.
<EOS>
That
his
resignation
was
a
thing
finally
fixed
on
,
a
fact
all
but
completed
,
was
not
in
his
mind
a
matter
of
any
doubt
;
he
knew
his
own
weakness
;
he
knew
how
prone
he
was
to
be
led
;
but
he
was
not
weak
enough
to
give
way
now
,
to
go
back
from
the
position
to
which
his
conscience
had
driven
him
,
after
having
purposely
come
to
London
to
declare
his
determination
:
he
did
not
in
the
least
doubt
his
resolution
,
but
he
greatly
doubted
his
power
of
defending
it
against
his
son
-
in
-
law
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
very
tired
,
Susan
,
"
said
he
:
"
would
n't
you
like
to
go
to
bed
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Susan
did
n't
want
to
go
till
her
husband
went
.
<EOS>
She
had
an
idea
that
her
papa
might
be
bullied
if
she
were
away
:
she
was
n't
tired
at
all
,
or
at
least
she
said
so
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
was
pacing
the
room
,
expressing
,
by
certain
nods
of
his
head
,
his
opinion
of
the
utter
fatuity
of
his
father
-
in
-
law
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
at
last
he
said
,
 
and
angels
might
have
blushed
at
the
rebuke
expressed
in
his
tone
and
emphasis
,
 
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
go
off
from
Barchester
so
suddenly
?
<EOS>
Why
did
you
take
such
a
step
without
giving
us
notice
,
after
what
had
passed
at
the
palace
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
warden
hung
his
head
,
and
made
no
reply
:
he
could
not
condescend
to
say
that
he
had
not
intended
to
give
his
son
-
in
-
law
the
slip
;
and
as
he
had
not
the
courage
to
avow
it
,
he
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
has
been
too
much
for
you
,
"
said
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
took
another
turn
,
and
again
ejaculated
,
"
Good
heavens
!
"
<EOS>
this
time
in
a
very
low
whisper
,
but
still
audible
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
'll
go
to
bed
,
"
said
the
warden
,
taking
up
a
side
candle
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
you
'll
promise
me
to
take
no
further
step
without
consultation
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
made
no
answer
,
but
slowly
proceeded
to
light
his
candle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
continued
the
other
,
"
such
a
declaration
as
that
you
made
to
Sir
Abraham
means
nothing
.
<EOS>
Come
,
warden
,
promise
me
this
.
<EOS>
The
whole
affair
,
you
see
,
is
already
settled
,
and
that
with
very
little
trouble
or
expense
.
<EOS>
Bold
has
been
compelled
to
abandon
his
action
,
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
remain
quiet
at
the
hospital
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
still
made
no
reply
,
but
looked
meekly
into
his
son
-
in
-
law
's
face
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
thought
he
knew
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
but
he
was
mistaken
;
he
thought
that
he
had
already
talked
over
a
vacillating
man
to
resign
his
promise
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
"
said
he
,
"
promise
Susan
to
give
up
this
idea
of
resigning
the
wardenship
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
warden
looked
at
his
daughter
,
thinking
probably
at
the
moment
that
if
Eleanor
were
contented
with
him
,
he
need
not
so
much
regard
his
other
child
,
and
said
,
"
I
am
sure
Susan
will
not
ask
me
to
break
my
word
,
or
to
do
what
I
know
to
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
"
said
she
,
"
it
would
be
madness
in
you
to
throw
up
your
preferment
.
<EOS>
What
are
you
to
live
on
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
,
that
feeds
the
young
ravens
,
will
take
care
of
me
also
,
"
said
Mr
Harding
,
with
a
smile
,
as
though
afraid
of
giving
offence
by
making
his
reference
to
scripture
too
solemn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pish
!
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
turning
away
rapidly
.
<EOS>
"
If
the
ravens
persisted
in
refusing
the
food
prepared
for
them
,
they
would
n't
be
fed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
clergyman
generally
dislikes
to
be
met
in
argument
by
any
scriptural
quotation
;
he
feels
as
affronted
as
a
doctor
does
,
when
recommended
by
an
old
woman
to
take
some
favourite
dose
,
or
as
a
lawyer
when
an
unprofessional
man
attempts
to
put
him
down
by
a
quibble
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
the
living
of
Crabtree
,
"
modestly
suggested
the
warden
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eighty
pounds
a
year
!
"
<EOS>
sneered
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
precentorship
,
"
said
the
father
-
in
-
law
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
goes
with
the
wardenship
,
"
said
the
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
was
prepared
to
argue
this
point
,
and
began
to
do
so
,
but
Dr
Grantly
stopped
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
warden
,
"
said
he
,
"
this
is
all
nonsense
.
<EOS>
Eighty
pounds
or
a
hundred
and
sixty
makes
very
little
difference
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
live
on
it
,
 
<EOS>
you
ca
n't
ruin
Eleanor
's
prospects
for
ever
.
<EOS>
In
point
of
fact
,
you
ca
n't
resign
;
the
bishop
would
n't
accept
it
;
the
whole
thing
is
settled
.
<EOS>
What
I
now
want
to
do
is
to
prevent
any
inconvenient
tittle
-
tattle
,
 
any
more
newspaper
articles
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
I
want
,
too
,
"
said
the
warden
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
to
prevent
that
,
"
continued
the
other
,
"
we
must
n't
let
any
talk
of
resignation
get
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
resign
,
"
said
the
warden
,
very
,
very
meekly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
heavens
!
<EOS>
Susan
,
my
dear
,
what
can
I
say
to
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
papa
,
"
said
Mrs
Grantly
,
getting
up
,
and
putting
her
arm
through
that
of
her
father
,
"
what
is
Eleanor
to
do
if
you
throw
away
your
income
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
hot
tear
stood
in
each
of
the
warden
's
eyes
as
he
looked
round
upon
his
married
daughter
.
<EOS>
Why
should
one
sister
who
was
so
rich
predict
poverty
for
another
?
<EOS>
Some
such
idea
as
this
was
on
his
mind
,
but
he
gave
no
utterance
to
it
.
<EOS>
Then
he
thought
of
the
pelican
feeding
its
young
with
blood
from
its
own
breast
,
but
he
gave
no
utterance
to
that
either
;
and
then
of
Eleanor
waiting
for
him
at
home
,
waiting
to
congratulate
him
on
the
end
of
all
his
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
"
Think
of
Eleanor
,
papa
,
"
said
Mrs
Grantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
think
of
her
,
"
said
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
not
do
this
rash
thing
?
<EOS>
"
The
lady
was
really
moved
beyond
her
usual
calm
composure
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
can
never
be
rash
to
do
right
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
certainly
resign
this
wardenship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Mr
Harding
,
there
is
nothing
before
you
but
ruin
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
now
moved
beyond
all
endurance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ruin
both
for
you
and
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
mean
to
pay
the
monstrous
expenses
of
this
action
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Grantly
suggested
that
,
as
the
action
was
abandoned
,
the
costs
would
not
be
heavy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
they
will
,
my
dear
,
"
continued
he
.
<EOS>
"
One
can
not
have
the
attorney
-
general
up
at
twelve
o'clock
at
night
for
nothing
;
 
but
of
course
your
father
has
not
thought
of
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
sell
my
furniture
,
"
said
the
warden
.
  
<EOS>
"
Furniture
!
"
ejaculated
the
other
,
with
a
most
powerful
sneer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
archdeacon
,
"
said
the
lady
,
"
<EOS>
we
need
n't
mind
that
at
present
.
<EOS>
You
know
you
never
expected
papa
to
pay
the
costs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Such
absurdity
is
enough
to
provoke
Job
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
marching
quickly
up
and
down
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
father
is
like
a
child
.
<EOS>
Eight
hundred
pounds
a
year
!
 
<EOS>
eight
hundred
and
eighty
with
the
house
,
 
with
nothing
to
do
.
<EOS>
The
very
place
for
him
.
<EOS>
And
to
throw
that
up
because
some
scoundrel
writes
an
article
in
a
newspaper
!
<EOS>
Well
;
 
I
have
done
my
duty
.
<EOS>
If
he
chooses
to
ruin
his
child
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
it
;
"
and
he
stood
still
at
the
fire
-
place
,
and
looked
at
himself
in
a
dingy
mirror
which
stood
on
the
chimney
-
piece
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
for
about
a
minute
,
and
then
the
warden
,
finding
that
nothing
else
was
coming
,
lighted
his
candle
,
and
quietly
said
,
"
Good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
papa
,
"
said
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
the
warden
retired
;
but
,
<EOS>
as
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
,
he
heard
the
well
-
known
ejaculation
,
 
slower
,
lower
,
more
solemn
,
more
ponderous
than
ever
,
 
"
Good
heavens

<EOS>
THE
WARDEN
RESIGNS
 
<EOS>
The
party
met
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
;
and
a
very
sombre
affair
it
was
,
 
very
unlike
the
breakfasts
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
three
thin
,
small
,
dry
bits
of
bacon
,
each
an
inch
long
,
served
up
under
a
huge
old
plated
cover
;
there
were
four
three
-
cornered
bits
of
dry
toast
,
and
four
square
bits
of
buttered
toast
;
there
was
a
loaf
of
bread
,
and
some
oily
-
looking
butter
;
and
on
the
sideboard
there
were
the
remains
of
a
cold
shoulder
of
mutton
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
,
however
,
had
not
come
up
from
his
rectory
to
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
to
enjoy
himself
,
and
therefore
nothing
was
said
of
the
scanty
fare
.
  
<EOS>
The
guests
were
as
sorry
as
the
viands
;
 
hardly
anything
was
said
over
the
breakfast
-
table
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
munched
his
toast
in
ominous
silence
,
turning
over
bitter
thoughts
in
his
deep
mind
.
<EOS>
The
warden
tried
to
talk
to
his
daughter
,
and
she
tried
to
answer
him
;
but
they
both
failed
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
feelings
at
present
in
common
between
them
.
<EOS>
The
warden
was
thinking
only
of
getting
back
to
Barchester
,
and
calculating
whether
the
archdeacon
would
expect
him
to
wait
for
him
;
and
Mrs
Grantly
was
preparing
herself
for
a
grand
attack
which
she
was
to
make
on
her
father
,
as
agreed
upon
between
herself
and
her
husband
during
their
curtain
confabulation
of
that
morning
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
waiter
had
creaked
out
of
the
room
with
the
last
of
the
teacups
,
the
archdeacon
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
as
though
to
admire
the
view
.
<EOS>
The
room
looked
out
on
a
narrow
passage
which
runs
from
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
to
Paternoster
Row
;
and
Dr
Grantly
patiently
perused
the
names
of
the
three
shopkeepers
whose
doors
were
in
view
.
<EOS>
The
warden
still
kept
his
seat
at
the
table
,
and
examined
the
pattern
of
the
tablecloth
;
and
<EOS>
Mrs
Grantly
,
seating
herself
on
the
sofa
,
began
to
knit
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
while
the
warden
pulled
his
Bradshaw
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
began
laboriously
to
consult
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
train
for
Barchester
at
10
A.M.
<EOS>
That
was
out
of
the
question
,
for
it
was
nearly
ten
already
.
<EOS>
Another
at
3
P.M.
;
another
,
the
night
-
mail
train
,
at
9
P.M.
<EOS>
The
three
o'clock
train
would
take
him
home
to
tea
,
and
would
suit
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
think
I
shall
go
back
home
at
three
o'clock
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
shall
get
home
at
half
-
past
eight
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
there
's
anything
to
keep
me
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
archdeacon
and
I
return
by
the
early
train
to
-
morrow
,
papa
;
wo
n't
you
wait
and
go
back
with
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Eleanor
will
expect
me
tonight
;
and
I
've
so
much
to
do
;
and
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Much
to
do
!
"
said
the
archdeacon
sotto
voce
;
but
the
warden
heard
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
wait
for
us
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Thank
ye
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
I
think
I
'll
go
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
The
tamest
animal
will
turn
when
driven
too
hard
,
and
even
Mr
Harding
was
beginning
to
fight
for
his
own
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
wo
n't
be
back
before
three
?
"
said
the
lady
,
addressing
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
leave
this
at
two
,
"
said
the
warden
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
out
of
the
question
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
answering
his
wife
,
and
still
reading
the
shopkeepers
'
names
;
"
I
do
n't
suppose
I
shall
be
back
till
five
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
another
long
pause
,
during
which
Mr
Harding
continued
to
study
his
Bradshaw
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
to
Cox
and
Cummins
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
to
Cox
and
Cummins
,
"
said
the
warden
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
where
his
son
-
in
-
law
went
.
<EOS>
The
names
of
Cox
and
Cummins
had
now
no
interest
in
his
ears
.
<EOS>
What
had
he
to
do
with
Cox
and
Cummins
further
,
having
already
had
his
suit
finally
adjudicated
upon
in
a
court
of
conscience
,
a
judgment
without
power
of
appeal
fully
registered
,
and
the
matter
settled
so
that
all
the
lawyers
in
London
could
not
disturb
it
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
could
go
to
Cox
and
Cummins
,
could
remain
there
all
day
in
anxious
discussion
;
but
what
might
be
said
there
was
no
longer
matter
of
interest
to
him
,
<EOS>
who
was
so
soon
to
lay
aside
the
name
of
warden
of
Barchester
Hospital
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
took
up
his
shining
new
clerical
hat
,
and
put
on
his
black
new
clerical
gloves
,
and
looked
heavy
,
respectable
,
decorous
,
and
opulent
,
a
decided
clergyman
of
the
Church
of
England
,
every
inch
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
shall
see
you
at
Barchester
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
The
warden
supposed
he
would
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
once
more
beseech
you
to
take
no
further
steps
till
you
see
my
father
;
if
you
owe
me
nothing
,
"
and
the
archdeacon
looked
as
though
he
thought
a
great
deal
were
due
to
him
,
"
at
least
you
owe
so
much
to
my
father
;
"
and
,
without
waiting
for
a
reply
,
Dr
Grantly
wended
his
way
to
Cox
and
Cummins
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Grantly
waited
till
the
last
fall
of
her
husband
's
foot
was
heard
,
as
he
turned
out
of
the
court
into
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
and
then
commenced
her
task
of
talking
her
father
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
"
she
began
,
"
this
is
a
most
serious
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
it
is
,
"
said
the
warden
,
ringing
the
bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
greatly
feel
the
distress
of
mind
you
must
have
endured
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
do
,
my
dear
;
"
 
and
he
ordered
the
waiter
to
bring
him
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
write
,
papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
;
 
I
am
going
to
write
my
resignation
to
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
pray
,
papa
,
put
it
off
till
our
return
;
 
pray
put
it
off
till
you
have
seen
the
bishop
;
 
dear
papa
!
<EOS>
for
my
sake
,
for
Eleanor
's
!
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
It
is
for
your
sake
and
Eleanor
's
that
I
do
this
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
at
least
,
that
my
children
may
never
have
to
be
ashamed
of
their
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
talk
about
shame
,
papa
?
"
<EOS>
and
she
stopped
while
the
waiter
creaked
in
with
the
paper
,
and
then
slowly
creaked
out
again
;
"
how
can
you
talk
about
shame
?
<EOS>
you
know
what
all
your
friends
think
about
this
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
warden
spread
his
paper
on
the
table
,
placing
it
on
the
meagre
blotting
-
book
which
the
hotel
afforded
,
and
sat
himself
down
to
write
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
refuse
me
one
request
,
papa
?
"
<EOS>
continued
his
daughter
;
"
you
wo
n't
refuse
to
delay
your
letter
for
two
short
days
?
<EOS>
Two
days
can
make
no
possible
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
he
naïvely
,
"
if
I
waited
till
I
got
to
Barchester
,
I
might
,
perhaps
,
be
prevented
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
surely
you
would
not
wish
to
offend
the
bishop
?
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
forbid
!
<EOS>
The
bishop
is
not
apt
to
take
offence
,
and
knows
me
too
well
to
take
in
bad
part
anything
that
I
may
be
called
on
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
papa
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Susan
,
"
said
he
,
"
my
mind
on
this
subject
is
made
up
;
it
is
not
without
much
repugnance
that
I
act
in
opposition
to
the
advice
of
such
men
as
Sir
Abraham
Haphazard
and
the
archdeacon
;
but
in
this
matter
I
can
take
no
advice
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
alter
the
resolution
to
which
I
have
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
two
days
,
papa
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
;
 
nor
can
I
delay
it
.
<EOS>
You
may
add
to
my
present
unhappiness
by
pressing
me
,
but
you
can
not
change
my
purpose
;
it
will
be
a
comfort
to
me
if
you
will
let
the
matter
rest
"
:
and
,
dipping
his
pen
into
the
inkstand
,
he
fixed
his
eyes
intently
on
the
paper
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
his
manner
which
taught
his
daughter
to
perceive
that
he
was
in
earnest
;
she
had
at
one
time
ruled
supreme
in
her
father
's
house
,
but
she
knew
that
there
were
moments
<EOS>
when
,
mild
and
meek
as
he
was
,
he
would
have
his
way
,
and
the
present
was
an
occasion
of
the
sort
.
<EOS>
She
returned
,
therefore
,
to
her
knitting
,
and
very
shortly
after
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
warden
was
now
at
liberty
to
compose
his
letter
,
and
,
as
it
was
characteristic
of
the
man
,
it
shall
be
given
at
full
length
.
<EOS>
The
official
letter
,
which
,
when
written
,
seemed
to
him
to
be
too
formally
cold
to
be
sent
alone
<EOS>
to
so
dear
a
friend
,
was
accompanied
by
a
private
note
;
and
both
are
here
inserted
.
  
<EOS>
The
letter
of
resignation
ran
as
follows
:
    
CHAPTER
HOTEL
,
ST
.
<EOS>
PAUL
's
,
LONDON
,
August
,
18
    
My
LORD
BISHOP
,
  
<EOS>
It
is
with
the
greatest
pain
that
I
feel
myself
constrained
to
resign
into
your
Lordship
's
hands
the
wardenship
of
the
hospital
at
Barchester
,
which
you
so
kindly
conferred
upon
me
,
now
nearly
twelve
years
since
.
  
<EOS>
I
need
not
explain
the
circumstances
which
have
made
this
step
appear
necessary
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
are
aware
that
a
question
has
arisen
as
to
the
right
of
the
warden
to
the
income
which
has
been
allotted
to
the
wardenship
;
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
this
right
is
not
well
made
out
,
and
I
hesitate
to
incur
the
risk
of
taking
an
income
to
which
my
legal
claim
appears
doubtful
.
  
<EOS>
The
office
of
precentor
of
the
cathedral
is
,
as
your
Lordship
is
aware
,
joined
to
that
of
the
warden
<EOS>
;
that
is
to
say
,
the
precentor
has
for
many
years
been
the
warden
of
the
hospital
;
there
is
,
however
,
nothing
to
make
the
junction
of
the
two
offices
necessary
,
and
,
unless
you
or
the
dean
and
chapter
object
to
such
an
arrangement
,
I
would
wish
to
keep
the
precentorship
.
<EOS>
The
income
of
this
office
will
now
be
necessary
to
me
;
indeed
,
I
do
not
know
why
I
should
be
ashamed
to
say
that
I
should
have
difficulty
in
supporting
myself
without
it
.
  
<EOS>
Your
Lordship
,
and
such
others
as
you
may
please
to
consult
on
the
matter
,
will
at
once
see
that
my
resignation
of
the
wardenship
need
offer
not
the
slightest
bar
to
its
occupation
by
another
person
.
<EOS>
I
am
thought
in
the
wrong
by
all
those
whom
I
have
consulted
in
the
matter
;
I
have
very
little
but
an
inward
and
an
unguided
conviction
of
my
own
to
bring
me
to
this
step
,
and
I
shall
,
indeed
,
be
hurt
to
find
that
any
slur
is
thrown
on
the
preferment
which
your
kindness
bestowed
on
me
,
by
my
resignation
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
,
at
any
rate
for
one
,
shall
look
on
any
successor
whom
you
may
appoint
as
enjoying
a
clerical
situation
of
the
highest
respectability
,
and
one
to
which
your
Lordship
's
nomination
gives
an
indefeasible
right
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
finish
this
official
letter
without
again
thanking
your
Lordship
for
all
your
great
kindness
,
and
I
beg
to
subscribe
myself
    
<EOS>
Your
Lordship
's
most
obedient
servant
,
  
SEPTIMUS
HARDING
,
  
Warden
of
Barchester
Hospital
,
and
Precentor
of
the
Cathedral
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
wrote
the
following
private
note
:
    
My
DEAR
BISHOP
,
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
send
you
the
accompanying
official
letter
without
a
warmer
expression
of
thanks
for
all
your
kindness
than
would
befit
a
document
which
may
to
a
certain
degree
be
made
public
.
<EOS>
You
,
I
know
,
will
understand
the
feeling
,
and
,
perhaps
,
pity
the
weakness
which
makes
me
resign
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
made
of
calibre
strong
enough
to
withstand
public
attack
.
<EOS>
Were
I
convinced
that
I
stood
on
ground
perfectly
firm
,
that
I
was
certainly
justified
in
taking
eight
hundred
a
year
under
Hiram
's
will
<EOS>
,
I
should
feel
bound
by
duty
to
retain
the
position
,
however
unendurable
might
be
the
nature
of
the
assault
;
but
,
as
I
do
not
feel
this
conviction
,
I
can
not
believe
that
you
will
think
me
wrong
in
what
I
am
doing
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
at
one
time
an
idea
of
keeping
only
some
moderate
portion
of
the
income
;
perhaps
three
hundred
a
year
,
and
of
remitting
the
remainder
to
the
trustees
;
but
it
occurred
to
me
,
and
I
think
with
reason
,
that
by
so
doing
I
should
place
my
successors
in
an
invidious
position
,
and
greatly
damage
your
patronage
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
let
me
have
a
line
from
you
to
say
that
you
do
not
blame
me
for
what
I
am
doing
,
and
that
the
officiating
vicar
of
Crabtree
Parva
will
be
the
same
to
you
as
the
warden
of
the
hospital
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
very
anxious
about
the
precentorship
:
the
archdeacon
thinks
it
must
go
with
the
wardenship
;
I
think
not
,
and
,
that
,
having
it
,
I
can
not
be
ousted
.
<EOS>
I
will
,
however
,
be
guided
by
you
and
the
dean
.
<EOS>
No
other
duty
will
suit
me
so
well
,
or
come
so
much
within
my
power
of
adequate
performance
.
  
<EOS>
I
thank
you
from
my
heart
for
the
preferment
which
I
am
now
giving
up
,
and
for
all
your
kindness
,
and
am
,
dear
bishop
,
now
as
always
    
Yours
most
sincerely
,
SEPTIMUS

<EOS>
Having
written
these
letters
and
made
a
copy
of
the
former
one
for
the
benefit
of
the
archdeacon
,
Mr
Harding
,
whom
we
must
now
cease
to
call
the
warden
,
he
having
designated
himself
so
for
the
last
time
,
found
that
it
was
nearly
two
o'clock
,
and
that
he
must
prepare
for
his
journey
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
from
this
time
he
never
again
admitted
the
name
by
which
he
had
been
so
familiarly
known
,
and
in
which
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
he
had
rejoiced
.
<EOS>
The
love
of
titles
is
common
to
all
men
,
and
a
vicar
or
fellow
is
as
pleased
at
becoming
Mr
Archdeacon
or
Mr
Provost
,
as
a
lieutenant
at
getting
his
captaincy
,
or
a
city
tallow
-
chandler
in
becoming
Sir
John
on
the
occasion
of
a
Queen
's
visit
to
a
new
bridge
.
<EOS>
But
warden
he
was
no
longer
,
and
the
name
of
precentor
,
though
the
office
was
to
him
so
dear
,
confers
in
itself
no
sufficient
distinction
;
our
friend
,
therefore
,
again
became
Mr
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Grantly
had
gone
out
<EOS>
;
he
had
,
therefore
,
no
one
to
delay
him
by
further
entreaties
to
postpone
his
journey
;
he
had
soon
arranged
his
bag
,
and
paid
his
bill
,
and
,
leaving
a
note
for
his
daughter
,
in
which
he
put
the
copy
of
his
official
letter
,
he
got
into
a
cab
and
drove
away
to
the
station
with
something
of
triumph
in
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Had
he
not
cause
for
triumph
?
<EOS>
Had
he
not
been
supremely
successful
?
<EOS>
Had
he
not
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
held
his
own
purpose
against
that
of
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
and
manfully
combated
against
great
odds
,
 
against
the
archdeacon
's
wife
as
well
as
the
archdeacon
?
<EOS>
Had
he
not
gained
a
great
victory
,
and
was
it
not
fit
that
he
should
step
into
his
cab
with
triumph
?
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
told
Eleanor
when
he
would
return
,
but
she
was
on
the
look
-
out
for
him
by
every
train
by
which
he
could
arrive
,
and
the
pony
-
carriage
was
at
the
Barchester
station
when
the
train
drew
up
at
the
platform
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
he
,
sitting
beside
her
,
as
she
steered
her
little
vessel
to
one
side
of
the
road
to
make
room
for
the
clattering
omnibus
as
they
passed
from
the
station
into
the
town
,
"
I
hope
you
'll
be
able
to
feel
a
proper
degree
of
respect
for
the
vicar
of
Crabtree
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
papa
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
am
so
glad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
great
comfort
in
returning
home
to
that
pleasant
house
,
though
he
was
to
leave
it
so
soon
,
and
in
discussing
with
his
daughter
all
that
he
had
done
,
and
all
that
he
had
to
do
.
<EOS>
It
must
take
some
time
to
get
out
of
one
house
into
another
;
the
curate
at
Crabtree
could
not
be
abolished
under
six
months
,
that
is
,
unless
other
provision
could
be
made
for
him
;
and
then
the
furniture
:
 
the
most
of
that
must
be
sold
to
pay
Sir
Abraham
Haphazard
for
sitting
up
till
twelve
at
night
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
was
strangely
ignorant
as
to
lawyers
'
bills
;
he
had
no
idea
,
from
twenty
pounds
to
two
thousand
,
as
to
the
sum
in
which
he
was
indebted
for
legal
assistance
.
<EOS>
True
,
he
had
called
in
no
lawyer
himself
;
true
,
he
had
been
no
consenting
party
to
the
employment
of
either
Cox
and
Cummins
,
or
Sir
Abraham
;
he
had
never
been
consulted
on
such
matters
;
 
the
archdeacon
had
managed
all
this
himself
,
never
for
a
moment
suspecting
that
Mr
Harding
would
take
upon
him
to
end
the
matter
in
a
way
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
Had
the
lawyers
'
bills
been
ten
thousand
pounds
,
Mr
Harding
could
not
have
helped
it
;
but
he
was
not
on
that
account
disposed
to
dispute
his
own
liability
.
<EOS>
The
question
never
occurred
to
him
;
but
it
did
occur
to
him
that
he
had
very
little
money
at
his
banker
's
,
that
he
could
receive
nothing
further
from
the
hospital
,
and
that
the
sale
of
the
furniture
was
his
only
resource
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
all
,
papa
,
"
said
Eleanor
pleadingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
all
,
my
dear
,
"
said
he
;
"
that
is
,
if
we
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
We
must
have
a
little
at
Crabtree
,
 
<EOS>
but
it
can
only
be
a
little
;
we
must
put
a
bold
front
on
it
,
Nelly
;
it
is
n't
easy
to
come
down
from
affluence
to
poverty
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
they
planned
their
future
mode
of
life
;
the
father
taking
comfort
from
the
reflection
that
his
daughter
would
soon
be
freed
from
it
,
and
she
resolving
that
her
father
would
soon
have
in
her
own
house
a
ready
means
of
escape
from
the
solitude
of
the
Crabtree
vicarage
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
archdeacon
left
his
wife
and
father
-
in
-
law
at
the
Chapter
Coffee
House
to
go
to
Messrs
Cox
and
Cummins
,
he
had
no
very
defined
idea
of
what
he
had
to
do
when
he
got
there
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
when
at
law
,
or
in
any
way
engaged
in
matters
requiring
legal
assistance
,
are
very
apt
to
go
to
their
lawyers
without
much
absolute
necessity
;
 
gentlemen
when
doing
so
,
are
apt
to
describe
such
attendance
as
quite
compulsory
,
and
very
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
The
lawyers
,
on
the
other
hand
,
do
not
at
all
see
the
necessity
,
though
they
quite
agree
as
to
the
disagreeable
nature
of
the
visit
;
 
gentlemen
when
so
engaged
are
usually
somewhat
gravelled
at
finding
nothing
to
say
to
their
learned
friends
;
they
generally
talk
a
little
politics
,
a
little
weather
,
ask
some
few
foolish
questions
about
their
suit
,
and
then
withdraw
,
having
passed
half
an
hour
in
a
small
dingy
waiting
-
room
,
in
company
with
some
junior
assistant
-
clerk
,
and
ten
minutes
with
the
members
of
the
firm
;
the
business
is
then
over
for
which
the
gentleman
has
come
up
to
London
,
probably
a
distance
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
he
goes
to
the
play
,
and
dines
at
his
friend
's
club
,
and
has
a
bachelor
's
liberty
and
bachelor
's
recreation
for
three
or
four
days
;
and
he
could
not
probably
plead
the
desire
of
such
gratifications
as
a
reason
to
his
wife
for
a
trip
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
Married
ladies
,
when
your
husbands
find
they
are
positively
obliged
to
attend
their
legal
advisers
,
the
nature
of
the
duty
to
be
performed
is
generally
of
this
description
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
would
not
have
dreamt
of
leaving
London
without
going
to
Cox
and
Cummins
;
and
yet
he
had
nothing
to
say
to
them
.
<EOS>
The
game
was
up
;
he
plainly
saw
that
Mr
Harding
in
this
matter
was
not
to
be
moved
;
his
only
remaining
business
on
this
head
was
to
pay
the
bill
and
have
done
with
it
;
and
I
think
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
,
that
whatever
the
cause
may
be
that
takes
a
gentleman
to
a
lawyer
's
chambers
,
he
never
goes
there
to
pay
his
bill
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
<EOS>
Grantly
,
however
,
in
the
eyes
of
Messrs
Cox
and
Cummins
,
represented
the
spiritualities
of
the
diocese
of
Barchester
,
as
Mr
Chadwick
did
the
temporalities
,
and
was
,
therefore
,
too
great
a
man
to
undergo
the
half
-
hour
in
the
clerk
's
room
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
necessary
that
we
should
listen
to
the
notes
of
sorrow
in
which
the
archdeacon
bewailed
to
Mr
Cox
the
weakness
of
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
and
the
end
of
all
their
hopes
of
triumph
;
nor
need
we
repeat
the
various
exclamations
of
surprise
with
which
the
mournful
intelligence
was
received
.
<EOS>
No
tragedy
occurred
,
though
Mr
Cox
,
a
short
and
somewhat
bull
-
necked
man
,
was
very
near
a
fit
of
apoplexy
when
he
first
attempted
to
ejaculate
that
fatal
word
 
resign
!
  
<EOS>
Over
and
over
again
did
Mr
Cox
attempt
to
enforce
on
the
archdeacon
the
propriety
of
urging
on
Mr
Warden
the
madness
of
the
deed
he
was
about
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eight
hundred
a
year
!
"
said
Mr
Cox
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
nothing
whatever
to
do
!
"
said
Mr
Cummins
,
who
had
joined
the
conference
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
private
fortune
,
I
believe
,
"
said
Mr
Cox
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
shilling
,
"
said
Mr
Cummins
,
in
a
very
low
voice
,
shaking
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
of
such
a
case
in
all
my
experience
,
"
said
Mr
Cox
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eight
hundred
a
year
,
and
as
nice
a
house
as
any
gentleman
could
wish
to
hang
up
his
hat
in
,
"
said
Mr
Cummins
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
an
unmarried
daughter
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
"
said
Mr
Cox
,
with
much
moral
seriousness
in
his
tone
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
only
sighed
as
each
separate
wail
was
uttered
,
and
shook
his
head
,
signifying
that
the
fatuity
of
some
people
was
past
belief
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
he
might
do
,
"
said
Mr
Cummins
,
brightening
up
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
how
you
might
save
it
:
 
let
him
exchange
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Exchange
where
?
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Exchange
for
a
living
.
<EOS>
There
's
Quiverful
,
of
Puddingdale
;
 
he
has
twelve
children
,
and
would
be
delighted
to
get
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
Puddingdale
is
only
four
hundred
,
but
that
would
be
saving
something
out
of
the
fire
:
Mr
Harding
would
have
a
curate
,
and
still
keep
three
hundred
or
three
hundred
and
fifty
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
opened
his
ears
and
listened
;
he
really
thought
the
scheme
might
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
newspapers
,
"
continued
Mr
Cummins
,
"
might
hammer
away
at
Quiverful
every
day
for
the
next
six
months
without
his
minding
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
took
up
his
hat
,
and
returned
to
his
hotel
,
thinking
the
matter
over
deeply
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
he
would
sound
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
A
man
with
twelve
children
would
do
much
to
double
his
income
.
   
<EOS>
FAREWELL
 
<EOS>
On
the
morning
after
Mr
Harding
's
return
home
he
received
a
note
from
the
bishop
full
of
affection
,
condolence
,
and
praise
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pray
come
to
me
at
once
,
"
wrote
the
bishop
,
"
that
we
may
see
what
had
better
be
done
;
as
to
the
hospital
,
I
will
not
say
a
word
to
dissuade
you
;
but
I
do
n't
like
your
going
to
Crabtree
:
at
any
rate
,
come
to
me
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
did
go
to
him
at
once
;
and
long
and
confidential
was
the
consultation
between
the
two
old
friends
.
<EOS>
There
they
sat
together
the
whole
long
day
,
plotting
to
get
the
better
of
the
archdeacon
,
and
to
carry
out
little
schemes
of
their
own
,
which
they
knew
would
be
opposed
by
the
whole
weight
of
his
authority
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
's
first
idea
was
,
that
Mr
Harding
,
if
left
to
himself
,
would
certainly
starve
,
 
not
in
the
figurative
sense
in
which
so
many
of
our
ladies
and
gentlemen
do
starve
on
incomes
from
one
to
five
hundred
a
year
;
not
that
he
would
be
starved
as
regarded
dress
coats
,
port
wine
,
and
pocket
-
money
;
but
that
he
would
positively
perish
of
inanition
for
want
of
bread
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
a
man
to
live
,
when
he
gives
up
all
his
income
?
"
said
the
bishop
to
himself
.
<EOS>
And
then
the
good
-
natured
little
man
began
to
consider
how
his
friend
might
be
best
rescued
from
a
death
so
horrid
and
painful
.
  
<EOS>
His
first
proposition
to
Mr
Harding
was
,
that
they
should
live
together
at
the
palace
.
<EOS>
He
,
the
bishop
,
positively
assured
Mr
Harding
that
he
wanted
another
resident
chaplain
,
 
not
a
young
working
chaplain
,
but
a
steady
,
middle
-
aged
chaplain
;
one
who
would
dine
and
drink
a
glass
of
wine
with
him
,
talk
about
the
archdeacon
,
and
poke
the
fire
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
did
not
positively
name
all
these
duties
,
but
he
gave
Mr
Harding
to
understand
that
such
would
be
the
nature
of
the
service
required
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
without
much
difficulty
that
Mr
Harding
made
his
friend
see
that
this
would
not
suit
him
;
that
he
could
not
throw
up
the
bishop
's
preferment
,
and
then
come
and
hang
on
at
the
bishop
's
table
;
that
he
could
not
allow
people
to
say
of
him
that
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
abandon
his
own
income
,
as
he
was
able
to
sponge
on
that
of
another
person
.
<EOS>
He
succeeded
,
however
,
in
explaining
that
the
plan
would
not
do
,
and
then
the
bishop
brought
forward
another
which
he
had
in
his
sleeve
.
<EOS>
He
,
the
bishop
,
had
in
his
will
left
certain
moneys
to
Mr
Harding
's
two
daughters
,
imagining
that
Mr
Harding
would
himself
want
no
such
assistance
during
his
own
lifetime
.
<EOS>
This
legacy
amounted
to
three
thousand
pounds
each
,
duty
free
;
and
he
now
pressed
it
as
a
gift
on
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
girls
,
you
know
,
"
said
he
,
"
will
have
it
just
the
same
when
you
're
gone
,
 
and
they
wo
n't
want
it
sooner
;
 
and
as
for
the
interest
during
my
lifetime
,
it
is
n't
worth
talking
about
.
<EOS>
I
have
more
than
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
much
difficulty
and
heartfelt
sorrow
,
Mr
Harding
refused
also
this
offer
.
<EOS>
No
;
his
wish
was
to
support
himself
,
however
poorly
,
 
not
to
be
supported
on
the
charity
of
anyone
.
<EOS>
It
was
hard
to
make
the
bishop
understand
this
;
it
was
hard
to
make
him
comprehend
that
the
only
real
favour
he
could
confer
was
the
continuation
of
his
independent
friendship
;
but
at
last
even
this
was
done
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
thought
the
bishop
,
he
will
come
and
dine
with
me
from
time
to
time
,
and
if
he
be
absolutely
starving
I
shall
see
it
.
  
<EOS>
Touching
the
precentorship
,
the
bishop
was
clearly
of
opinion
that
it
could
be
held
without
the
other
situation
,
 
an
opinion
from
which
no
one
differed
;
and
it
was
therefore
soon
settled
among
all
the
parties
concerned
,
that
Mr
Harding
should
still
be
the
precentor
of
the
cathedral
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
day
following
Mr
Harding
's
return
,
the
archdeacon
reached
Plumstead
full
of
Mr
Cummins
's
scheme
regarding
Puddingdale
and
Mr
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
On
the
very
next
morning
he
drove
over
to
Puddingdale
,
and
obtained
the
full
consent
of
the
wretched
clerical
Priam
,
who
was
endeavouring
to
feed
his
poor
Hecuba
and
a
dozen
of
Hectors
on
the
small
proceeds
of
his
ecclesiastical
kingdom
.
<EOS>
Mr
Quiverful
had
no
doubts
as
to
the
legal
rights
of
the
warden
;
his
conscience
would
be
quite
clear
as
to
accepting
the
income
;
and
as
to
_
The
Jupiter
_
,
he
begged
to
assure
the
archdeacon
that
he
was
quite
indifferent
to
any
emanations
from
the
profane
portion
of
the
periodical
press
.
  
<EOS>
Having
so
far
succeeded
,
he
next
sounded
the
bishop
;
but
here
he
was
astonished
by
most
unexpected
resistance
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
did
not
think
it
would
do
.
"
<EOS>
Not
do
,
why
not
?
"
<EOS>
and
seeing
that
his
father
was
not
shaken
,
he
repeated
the
question
in
a
severer
form
:
"
<EOS>
Why
not
do
,
my
lord
?
"
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
looked
very
unhappy
,
and
shuffled
about
in
his
chair
,
but
still
did
n't
give
way
;
he
thought
Puddingdale
would
n't
do
for
Mr
Harding
;
it
was
too
far
from
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
of
course
he
'll
have
a
curate
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
also
thought
that
Mr
Quiverful
would
n't
do
for
the
hospital
;
such
an
exchange
would
n't
look
well
at
such
a
time
;
and
,
when
pressed
harder
,
he
declared
he
did
n't
think
Mr
Harding
would
accept
of
Puddingdale
under
any
circumstances
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
he
to
live
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
,
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
declared
that
he
had
not
the
slightest
conception
how
life
was
to
be
sustained
within
him
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
then
left
his
father
,
and
went
down
to
the
hospital
;
but
Mr
Harding
would
n't
listen
at
all
to
the
Puddingdale
scheme
.
<EOS>
To
his
eyes
it
had
no
attraction
;
it
savoured
of
simony
,
and
was
likely
to
bring
down
upon
him
harder
and
more
deserved
strictures
than
any
he
had
yet
received
:
he
positively
declined
to
become
vicar
of
Puddingdale
under
any
circumstances
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
waxed
wroth
,
talked
big
,
and
looked
bigger
;
he
said
something
about
dependence
and
beggary
,
spoke
of
the
duty
every
man
was
under
to
earn
his
bread
,
made
passing
allusions
to
the
follies
of
youth
and
waywardness
of
age
,
as
though
Mr
Harding
were
afflicted
by
both
,
and
ended
by
declaring
that
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
he
had
left
no
stone
unturned
to
arrange
matters
on
the
best
and
easiest
footing
;
that
he
had
,
in
fact
,
so
arranged
them
,
that
he
had
so
managed
that
there
was
no
further
need
of
any
anxiety
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
And
how
had
he
been
paid
?
<EOS>
His
advice
had
been
systematically
rejected
;
he
had
been
not
only
slighted
,
but
distrusted
and
avoided
;
he
and
his
measures
had
been
utterly
thrown
over
,
as
had
been
Sir
Abraham
,
who
,
he
had
reason
to
know
,
was
much
pained
at
what
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
He
now
found
it
was
useless
to
interfere
any
further
,
and
he
should
retire
.
<EOS>
If
any
further
assistance
were
required
from
him
,
he
would
probably
be
called
on
,
and
should
be
again
happy
to
come
forward
.
<EOS>
And
so
he
left
the
hospital
,
and
has
not
since
entered
it
from
that
day
to
this
.
  
<EOS>
And
here
we
must
take
leave
of
Archdeacon
Grantly
.
<EOS>
We
fear
that
he
is
represented
in
these
pages
as
being
worse
than
he
is
;
but
we
have
had
to
do
with
his
foibles
,
and
not
with
his
virtues
.
<EOS>
We
have
seen
only
the
weak
side
of
the
man
,
and
have
lacked
the
opportunity
of
bringing
him
forward
on
his
strong
ground
.
<EOS>
That
he
is
a
man
somewhat
too
fond
of
his
own
way
,
and
not
sufficiently
scrupulous
in
his
manner
of
achieving
it
,
his
best
friends
can
not
deny
.
<EOS>
That
he
is
bigoted
in
favour
,
not
so
much
of
his
doctrines
as
of
his
cloth
,
is
also
true
:
and
it
is
true
that
the
possession
of
a
large
income
is
a
desire
that
sits
near
his
heart
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
the
archdeacon
is
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
conscience
;
he
spends
his
money
liberally
,
and
does
the
work
he
has
to
do
with
the
best
of
his
ability
;
he
improves
the
tone
of
society
of
those
among
whom
he
lives
.
<EOS>
His
aspirations
are
of
a
healthy
,
if
not
of
the
highest
,
kind
.
<EOS>
Though
never
an
austere
man
,
he
upholds
propriety
of
conduct
both
by
example
and
precept
.
<EOS>
He
is
generous
to
the
poor
,
and
hospitable
to
the
rich
;
in
matters
of
religion
he
is
sincere
,
and
yet
no
Pharisee
;
he
is
in
earnest
,
and
yet
no
fanatic
.
<EOS>
On
the
whole
,
the
Archdeacon
of
Barchester
is
a
man
doing
more
good
than
harm
,
 
a
man
to
be
furthered
and
supported
,
though
perhaps
also
to
be
controlled
;
and
it
is
matter
of
regret
to
us
that
the
course
of
our
narrative
has
required
that
we
should
see
more
of
his
weakness
than
his
strength
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
allowed
himself
no
rest
till
everything
was
prepared
for
his
departure
from
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
as
well
to
mention
that
he
was
not
driven
to
the
stern
necessity
of
selling
all
his
furniture
:
he
had
been
quite
in
earnest
in
his
intention
to
do
so
,
but
it
was
soon
made
known
to
him
that
the
claims
of
Messrs
Cox
and
Cummins
made
no
such
step
obligatory
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
had
thought
it
wise
to
make
use
of
the
threat
of
the
lawyer
's
bill
,
to
frighten
his
father
-
in
-
law
into
compliance
;
but
he
had
no
intention
to
saddle
Mr
Harding
with
costs
,
which
had
been
incurred
by
no
means
exclusively
for
his
benefit
.
<EOS>
The
amount
of
the
bill
was
added
to
the
diocesan
account
,
and
was
,
in
fact
,
paid
out
of
the
bishop
's
pocket
,
without
any
consciousness
on
the
part
of
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
A
great
part
of
his
furniture
he
did
resolve
to
sell
,
having
no
other
means
to
dispose
of
it
;
and
the
ponies
and
carriage
were
transferred
,
by
private
contract
,
to
the
use
of
an
old
maiden
lady
in
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
For
his
present
use
Mr
Harding
took
a
lodging
in
Barchester
,
and
thither
were
conveyed
such
articles
as
he
wanted
for
daily
use
:
 
his
music
,
books
,
and
instruments
,
his
own
arm
-
chair
,
and
Eleanor
's
pet
sofa
;
her
teapoy
and
his
cellaret
,
and
also
the
slender
but
still
sufficient
contents
of
his
wine
-
cellar
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Grantly
had
much
wished
that
her
sister
would
reside
at
Plumstead
,
till
her
father
's
house
at
Crabtree
should
be
ready
for
her
;
but
Eleanor
herself
strongly
resisted
this
proposal
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
urged
upon
her
,
that
a
lady
in
lodgings
cost
more
than
a
gentleman
;
and
that
,
under
her
father
's
present
circumstances
,
such
an
expense
should
be
avoided
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
had
not
pressed
her
father
to
give
up
the
hospital
in
order
that
she
might
live
at
Plumstead
Rectory
and
he
alone
in
his
Barchester
lodgings
;
nor
did
Eleanor
think
that
she
would
be
treating
a
certain
gentleman
very
fairly
,
if
she
betook
herself
to
the
house
which
he
would
be
the
least
desirous
of
entering
of
any
in
the
county
.
<EOS>
So
she
got
a
little
bedroom
for
herself
behind
the
sitting
-
room
,
and
just
over
the
little
back
parlour
of
the
chemist
,
with
whom
they
were
to
lodge
.
<EOS>
There
was
somewhat
of
a
savour
of
senna
softened
by
peppermint
about
the
place
;
but
,
on
the
whole
,
the
lodgings
were
clean
and
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
The
day
had
been
fixed
for
the
migration
of
the
ex
-
warden
,
and
all
Barchester
were
in
a
state
of
excitement
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Opinion
was
much
divided
as
to
the
propriety
of
Mr
Harding
's
conduct
.
<EOS>
The
mercantile
part
of
the
community
,
the
mayor
and
corporation
,
and
council
,
also
most
of
the
ladies
,
were
loud
in
his
praise
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
noble
,
nothing
more
generous
,
nothing
more
upright
.
<EOS>
But
the
gentry
were
of
a
different
way
of
thinking
,
 
especially
the
lawyers
and
the
clergymen
.
<EOS>
They
said
such
conduct
was
very
weak
and
undignified
;
that
Mr
Harding
evinced
a
lamentable
want
of
_
esprit
de
corps
_
,
as
well
as
courage
;
and
that
such
an
abdication
must
do
much
harm
,
and
could
do
but
little
good
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
evening
before
he
left
,
he
summoned
all
the
bedesmen
into
his
parlour
to
wish
them
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
With
Bunce
he
had
been
in
frequent
communication
since
his
return
from
London
,
and
had
been
at
much
pains
to
explain
to
the
old
man
the
cause
of
his
resignation
,
without
in
any
way
prejudicing
the
position
of
his
successor
.
<EOS>
The
others
,
also
,
he
had
seen
more
or
less
frequently
;
and
had
heard
from
most
of
them
separately
some
expression
of
regret
at
his
departure
;
but
he
had
postponed
his
farewell
till
the
last
evening
.
  
<EOS>
He
now
bade
the
maid
put
wine
and
glasses
on
the
table
;
and
had
the
chairs
arranged
around
the
room
;
and
sent
Bunce
to
each
of
the
men
to
request
they
would
come
and
say
farewell
to
their
late
warden
.
<EOS>
Soon
the
noise
of
aged
scuffling
feet
was
heard
upon
the
gravel
and
in
the
little
hall
,
and
the
eleven
men
who
were
enabled
to
leave
their
rooms
were
assembled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
my
friends
,
come
in
,
"
said
the
warden
;
 
<EOS>
he
was
still
warden
then
.
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
and
sit
down
;
"
and
he
took
the
hand
of
Abel
Handy
,
who
was
the
nearest
to
him
,
and
led
the
limping
grumbler
to
a
chair
.
<EOS>
The
others
followed
slowly
and
bashfully
;
the
infirm
,
the
lame
,
and
the
blind
:
<EOS>
poor
wretches
!
<EOS>
who
had
been
so
happy
,
had
they
but
known
it
!
<EOS>
Now
their
aged
faces
were
covered
with
shame
,
and
every
kind
word
from
their
master
was
a
coal
of
fire
burning
on
their
heads
.
  
<EOS>
When
first
the
news
had
reached
them
that
Mr
Harding
was
going
to
leave
the
hospital
,
it
had
been
received
with
a
kind
of
triumph
;
 
his
departure
was
,
as
it
were
,
a
prelude
to
success
.
<EOS>
He
had
admitted
his
want
of
right
to
the
money
about
which
they
were
disputing
;
and
as
it
did
not
belong
to
him
,
of
course
,
it
did
to
them
.
<EOS>
The
one
hundred
a
year
to
each
of
them
was
actually
becoming
a
reality
;
and
Abel
Handy
was
a
hero
,
and
Bunce
a
faint
-
hearted
sycophant
,
worthy
neither
honour
nor
fellowship
.
<EOS>
But
other
tidings
soon
made
their
way
into
the
old
men
's
rooms
.
<EOS>
It
was
first
notified
to
them
that
the
income
abandoned
by
Mr
Harding
would
not
come
to
them
;
and
these
accounts
were
confirmed
by
attorney
Finney
.
<EOS>
They
were
then
informed
that
Mr
Harding
's
place
would
be
at
once
filled
by
another
.
<EOS>
That
the
new
warden
could
not
be
a
kinder
man
they
all
knew
;
that
he
would
be
a
less
friendly
one
most
suspected
;
and
then
came
the
bitter
information
that
,
from
the
moment
of
Mr
Harding
's
departure
,
the
twopence
a
day
,
his
own
peculiar
gift
,
must
of
necessity
be
withdrawn
.
  
<EOS>
And
this
was
to
be
the
end
of
all
their
mighty
struggle
,
 
of
their
fight
for
their
rights
,
 
of
their
petition
,
and
their
debates
,
and
their
hopes
!
<EOS>
They
were
to
change
the
best
of
masters
for
a
possible
bad
one
,
and
to
lose
twopence
a
day
each
man
!
<EOS>
No
;
unfortunate
as
this
was
,
it
was
not
the
worst
,
or
nearly
the
worst
,
as
will
just
now
be
seen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
sit
down
,
my
friends
,
"
said
the
warden
;
"
I
want
to
say
a
word
to
you
and
to
drink
your
healths
,
before
I
leave
you
.
<EOS>
Come
up
here
,
Moody
,
here
is
a
chair
for
you
;
come
,
Jonathan
Crumple
;
"
 
and
by
degrees
he
got
the
men
to
be
seated
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
surprising
that
they
should
hang
back
with
faint
hearts
,
having
returned
so
much
kindness
with
such
deep
ingratitude
.
<EOS>
Last
of
all
of
them
came
Bunce
,
and
with
sorrowful
mien
and
slow
step
got
into
his
accustomed
seat
near
the
fire
-
place
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
were
all
in
their
places
,
Mr
Harding
rose
to
address
them
;
and
then
finding
himself
not
quite
at
home
on
his
legs
,
he
sat
down
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
old
friends
,
"
said
he
,
<EOS>
"
you
all
know
that
I
am
going
to
leave
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
sort
of
murmur
ran
round
the
room
,
intended
,
perhaps
,
to
express
regret
at
his
departure
;
but
it
was
but
a
murmur
,
and
might
have
meant
that
or
anything
else
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
has
been
lately
some
misunderstanding
between
us
.
<EOS>
You
have
thought
,
I
believe
,
that
you
did
not
get
all
that
you
were
entitled
to
,
and
that
the
funds
of
the
hospital
have
not
been
properly
disposed
of
.
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
I
can
not
say
what
should
be
the
disposition
of
these
moneys
,
or
how
they
should
be
managed
,
and
I
have
therefore
thought
it
best
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
never
wanted
to
drive
your
reverence
out
of
it
,
"
said
Handy
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
your
reverence
,
"
said
Skulpit
.
<EOS>
"
We
never
thought
it
would
come
to
this
.
<EOS>
When
I
signed
the
petition
,
 
that
is
,
I
did
n't
sign
it

Let

reverence
speak
,
ca
n't
you
?
"
said
Moody
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
continued
Mr
Harding
;
"
I
am
sure
you
did
not
wish
to
turn
me
out
;
but
I
thought
it
best
to
leave
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
very
good
hand
at
a
lawsuit
,
as
you
may
all
guess
;
and
when
it
seemed
necessary
that
our
ordinary
quiet
mode
of
living
should
be
disturbed
,
I
thought
it
better
to
go
.
<EOS>
I
am
neither
angry
nor
offended
with
any
man
in
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Bunce
uttered
a
kind
of
groan
,
very
clearly
expressive
of
disagreement
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
neither
angry
nor
displeased
with
any
man
in
the
hospital
,
"
repeated
Mr
Harding
,
emphatically
.
<EOS>
"
If
any
man
has
been
wrong
,
 
and
I
do
n't
say
any
man
has
,
 
he
has
erred
through
wrong
advice
.
<EOS>
In
this
country
all
are
entitled
to
look
for
their
own
rights
,
and
you
have
done
no
more
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
your
interests
and
my
interests
were
at
variance
,
I
could
give
you
no
counsel
on
this
subject
;
but
the
connection
between
us
has
ceased
;
my
income
can
no
longer
depend
on
your
doings
,
and
therefore
,
as
I
leave
you
,
I
venture
to
offer
to
you
my
advice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
men
all
declared
that
they
would
from
henceforth
be
entirely
guided
by
Mr
Harding
's
opinion
in
their
affairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Some
gentleman
will
probably
take
my
place
here
very
soon
,
and
I
strongly
advise
you
to
be
prepared
to
receive
him
in
a
kindly
spirit
and
to
raise
no
further
question
among
yourselves
as
to
the
amount
of
his
income
.
<EOS>
Were
you
to
succeed
in
lessening
what
he
has
to
receive
,
you
would
not
increase
your
own
allowance
.
<EOS>
The
surplus
would
not
go
to
you
;
your
wants
are
adequately
provided
for
,
and
your
position
could
hardly
be
improved
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
your
reverence
,
we
knows
it
,
"
said
Spriggs
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
true
,
your
reverence
,
"
said
Skulpit
.
<EOS>
"
We
sees
it
all
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr
Harding
,
"
said
Bunce
,
opening
his
mouth
for
the
first
time
;
"
I
believe
they
do
understand
it
now
,
now
that
they
've
driven
from
under
the
same
roof
with
them
such
a
master
as
not
one
of
them
<EOS>
will
ever
know
again
,
 
now
that
they
're
like
to
be
in
sore
want
of
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
come
,
Bunce
,
"
said
Mr
Harding
,
blowing
his
nose
and
manoeuvring
to
wipe
his
eyes
at
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
as
to
that
,
"
said
Handy
,
"
we
none
of
us
never
wanted
to
do
Mr
Harding
no
harm
;
if
he
's
going
now
,
it
's
not
along
of
us
;
and
I
do
n't
see
for
what
Mr
Bunce
speaks
up
agen
us
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
ruined
yourselves
,
and
you
've
ruined
me
too
,
and
that
's
why
,
"
said
Bunce
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
Bunce
,
"
said
Mr
Harding
;
"
there
's
nobody
ruined
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
'll
let
me
leave
you
all
friends
;
I
hope
you
'll
all
drink
a
glass
of
wine
in
friendly
feeling
with
me
and
with
one
another
.
<EOS>
You
'll
have
a
good
friend
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
doubt
,
in
your
new
warden
;
and
if
ever
you
want
any
other
,
why
after
all
I
'm
not
going
so
far
off
but
that
I
shall
sometimes
see
you
;
"
and
then
,
having
finished
his
speech
,
Mr
Harding
filled
all
the
glasses
,
and
himself
handed
each
a
glass
to
the
men
round
him
,
and
raising
his
own
said
:
    
"
God
bless
you
all
!
<EOS>
you
have
my
heartfelt
wishes
for
your
welfare
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
may
live
contented
,
and
die
trusting
in
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
,
and
thankful
to
Almighty
God
For
the
good
things
he
has
given
you
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
my
friends
!
"
<EOS>
and
Mr
Harding
drank
his
wine
.
  
<EOS>
Another
murmur
,
somewhat
more
articulate
than
the
first
,
passed
round
the
circle
,
and
this
time
it
was
intended
to
imply
a
blessing
on
Mr
Harding
.
<EOS>
It
had
,
however
,
but
little
cordiality
in
it
.
<EOS>
Poor
old
men
!
<EOS>
how
could
they
be
cordial
with
their
sore
consciences
and
shamed
faces
?
<EOS>
how
could
they
bid
God
bless
him
with
hearty
voices
and
a
true
benison
,
knowing
,
as
they
did
,
that
their
vile
cabal
had
driven
him
from
his
happy
home
,
and
sent
him
in
his
old
age
to
seek
shelter
under
a
strange
roof
-
tree
?
<EOS>
They
did
their
best
,
however
;
they
drank
their
wine
,
and
withdrew
.
  
<EOS>
As
they
left
the
hall
-
door
,
Mr
Harding
shook
hands
with
each
of
the
men
,
and
spoke
a
kind
word
to
them
about
their
individual
cases
and
ailments
;
and
so
they
departed
,
answering
his
questions
in
the
fewest
words
,
and
retreated
to
their
dens
,
a
sorrowful
repentant
crew
.
  
<EOS>
All
but
Bunce
,
who
still
remained
to
make
his
own
farewell
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
poor
old
Bell
,
"
said
Mr
Harding
;
"
I
must
n't
go
without
saying
a
word
to
him
;
come
through
with
me
,
Bunce
,
and
bring
the
wine
with
you
;
"
and
so
they
went
through
to
the
men
's
cottages
,
and
found
the
old
man
propped
up
as
usual
in
his
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
come
to
say
good
-
bye
to
you
,
Bell
,
"
said
Mr
Harding
,
speaking
loud
,
for
the
old
man
was
deaf
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
are
you
going
away
,
then
,
really
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
am
,
and
I
've
brought
you
a
glass
of
wine
;
so
that
we
may
part
friends
,
as
we
lived
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
took
the
proffered
glass
in
his
shaking
hands
,
and
drank
it
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
Bell
!
"
said
Mr
Harding
;
"
good
-
bye
,
my
old
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
so
you
're
really
going
?
<EOS>
"
the
man
again
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
am
,
Bell
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
poor
old
bed
-
ridden
creature
still
kept
Mr
Harding
's
hand
in
his
own
,
and
the
warden
thought
that
he
had
met
with
something
like
warmth
of
feeling
in
the
one
of
all
his
subjects
from
whom
it
was
the
least
likely
to
be
expected
;
for
poor
old
Bell
had
nearly
outlived
all
human
feelings
.
"
<EOS>
And
your
reverence
,
"
said
he
,
and
then
he
paused
,
while
his
old
palsied
head
shook
horribly
,
and
his
shrivelled
cheeks
sank
lower
within
his
jaws
,
and
his
glazy
eye
gleamed
with
a
momentary
light
;
"
and
your
reverence
<EOS>
,
shall
we
get
the
hundred
a
year
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
How
gently
did
Mr
Harding
try
to
extinguish
the
false
hope
of
money
which
had
been
so
wretchedly
raised
to
disturb
the
quiet
of
the
dying
man
!
<EOS>
One
other
week
and
his
mortal
coil
would
be
shuffled
off
;
in
one
short
week
would
God
resume
his
soul
,
and
set
it
apart
for
its
irrevocable
doom
;
seven
more
tedious
days
and
nights
of
senseless
inactivity
,
and
all
would
be
over
for
poor
Bell
in
this
world
;
and
yet
,
with
his
last
audible
words
,
he
was
demanding
his
moneyed
rights
,
and
asserting
himself
to
be
the
proper
heir
of
John
Hiram
's
bounty
!
<EOS>
Not
on
him
,
poor
sinner
as
he
was
,
be
the
load
of
such
sin
!
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
returned
to
his
parlour
,
meditating
with
a
sick
heart
on
what
he
had
seen
,
and
Bunce
with
him
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
describe
the
parting
of
these
two
good
men
,
for
good
men
they
were
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
that
the
late
warden
endeavoured
to
comfort
the
heart
of
the
old
bedesman
;
poor
old
Bunce
felt
that
his
days
of
comfort
were
gone
.
<EOS>
The
hospital
had
to
him
been
a
happy
home
,
but
it
could
be
so
no
longer
.
<EOS>
He
had
had
honour
there
,
and
friendship
;
he
had
recognised
his
master
,
and
been
recognised
;
all
his
wants
,
both
of
soul
and
body
,
had
been
supplied
,
and
he
had
been
a
happy
man
.
<EOS>
He
wept
grievously
as
he
parted
from
his
friend
,
and
the
tears
of
an
old
man
are
bitter
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
over
for
me
in
this
world
,
"
said
he
,
as
he
gave
the
last
squeeze
to
Mr
Harding
's
hand
;
"
I
have
now
to
forgive
those
who
have
injured
me
;
 
and
to
die
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
the
old
man
went
out
,
and
then
Mr
Harding
gave
way
to
his
grief
and
he
too
wept
aloud
.
   
<EOS>
CONCLUSION
 
<EOS>
Our
tale
is
now
done
,
and
it
only
remains
to
us
to
collect
the
scattered
threads
of
our
little
story
,
and
to
tie
them
into
a
seemly
knot
.
<EOS>
This
will
not
be
a
work
of
labour
,
either
to
the
author
or
to
his
readers
;
we
have
not
to
deal
with
many
personages
,
or
with
stirring
events
,
and
were
it
not
for
the
custom
of
the
thing
,
we
might
leave
it
to
the
imagination
of
all
concerned
to
conceive
how
affairs
at
Barchester
arranged
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
morning
after
the
day
last
alluded
to
,
Mr
Harding
,
at
an
early
hour
,
walked
out
of
the
hospital
,
with
his
daughter
under
his
arm
,
and
sat
down
quietly
to
breakfast
at
his
lodgings
over
the
chemist
's
shop
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
parade
about
his
departure
;
no
one
,
not
even
Bunce
,
was
there
to
witness
it
;
had
he
walked
to
the
apothecary
's
thus
early
to
get
a
piece
of
court
plaster
,
or
a
box
of
lozenges
,
he
could
not
have
done
it
with
less
appearance
of
an
important
movement
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
tear
in
Eleanor
's
eye
as
she
passed
through
the
big
gateway
and
over
the
bridge
;
but
Mr
Harding
walked
with
an
elastic
step
,
and
entered
his
new
abode
with
a
pleasant
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
dear
,
"
said
he
,
"
you
have
everything
ready
,
and
you
can
make
tea
here
just
as
nicely
as
in
the
parlour
at
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
Eleanor
took
off
her
bonnet
and
made
the
tea
.
<EOS>
After
this
manner
did
the
late
Warden
of
Barchester
Hospital
accomplish
his
flitting
,
and
change
his
residence
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
long
before
the
archdeacon
brought
his
father
to
discuss
the
subject
of
a
new
warden
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
looked
upon
the
nomination
as
his
own
,
and
he
had
in
his
eye
three
or
four
fitting
candidates
,
seeing
that
Mr
Cummins
's
plan
as
to
the
living
of
Puddingdale
could
not
be
brought
to
bear
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
describe
the
astonishment
which
confounded
him
,
when
his
father
declared
that
he
would
appoint
no
successor
to
Mr
Harding
?
<EOS>
"
If
we
can
get
the
matter
set
to
rights
,
Mr
Harding
will
return
,
"
said
the
bishop
;
"
and
if
we
can
not
,
it
will
be
wrong
to
put
any
other
gentleman
into
so
cruel
a
position
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
that
the
archdeacon
argued
and
lectured
,
and
even
threatened
;
in
vain
he
my
-
lorded
his
poor
father
in
his
sternest
manner
;
in
vain
his
"
good
heavens
!
"
were
ejaculated
in
a
tone
that
might
have
moved
a
whole
synod
,
let
alone
one
weak
and
aged
bishop
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
induce
his
father
to
fill
up
the
vacancy
caused
by
Mr
Harding
's
retirement
.
  
<EOS>
Even
John
Bold
would
have
pitied
the
feelings
with
which
the
archdeacon
returned
to
Plumstead
:
the
church
was
falling
,
nay
,
already
in
ruins
;
its
dignitaries
were
yielding
without
a
struggle
before
the
blows
of
its
antagonists
;
and
one
of
its
most
respected
bishops
,
his
own
father
,
 
the
man
considered
by
all
the
world
as
being
in
such
matters
under
his
,
Dr
Grantly
's
,
control
,
 
had
positively
resolved
to
capitulate
,
and
own
himself
vanquished
!
  
<EOS>
And
how
fared
the
hospital
under
this
resolve
of
its
visitor
?
<EOS>
Badly
indeed
.
<EOS>
It
is
now
some
years
since
Mr
Harding
left
it
,
and
the
warden
's
house
is
still
tenantless
.
<EOS>
Old
Bell
has
died
,
and
Billy
Gazy
;
the
one
-
eyed
Spriggs
has
drunk
himself
to
death
,
and
three
others
of
the
twelve
have
been
gathered
into
the
churchyard
mould
.
<EOS>
Six
have
gone
,
and
the
six
vacancies
remain
unfilled
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
six
have
died
,
with
no
kind
friend
to
solace
their
last
moments
,
with
no
wealthy
neighbour
to
administer
comforts
and
ease
the
stings
of
death
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
,
indeed
,
did
not
desert
them
;
from
him
they
had
such
consolation
as
a
dying
man
may
receive
from
his
Christian
pastor
;
but
it
was
the
occasional
kindness
of
a
stranger
which
ministered
to
them
,
and
not
the
constant
presence
of
a
master
,
a
neighbour
,
and
a
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
were
those
who
remained
better
off
than
those
who
died
.
<EOS>
Dissensions
rose
among
them
,
and
contests
for
pre
-
eminence
;
and
then
they
began
to
understand
that
soon
one
among
them
would
be
the
last
,
 
<EOS>
some
one
wretched
being
would
be
alone
there
in
that
now
comfortless
hospital
,
 
the
miserable
relic
of
what
had
once
been
so
good
and
so
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
The
building
of
the
hospital
itself
has
not
been
allowed
to
go
to
ruins
.
<EOS>
Mr
Chadwick
,
who
still
holds
his
stewardship
,
and
pays
the
accruing
rents
into
an
account
opened
at
a
bank
for
the
purpose
,
sees
to
that
;
but
the
whole
place
has
become
disordered
and
ugly
.
<EOS>
The
warden
's
garden
is
a
wretched
wilderness
,
the
drive
and
paths
are
covered
with
weeds
,
the
flower
-
beds
are
bare
,
and
the
unshorn
lawn
is
now
a
mass
of
long
damp
grass
and
unwholesome
moss
.
<EOS>
The
beauty
of
the
place
is
gone
;
its
attractions
have
withered
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
a
very
few
years
since
it
was
the
prettiest
spot
in
Barchester
,
and
now
it
is
a
disgrace
to
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
did
not
go
out
to
Crabtree
Parva
.
<EOS>
An
arrangement
was
made
which
respected
the
homestead
of
Mr
Smith
and
his
happy
family
,
and
put
Mr
Harding
into
possession
of
a
small
living
within
the
walls
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
smallest
possible
parish
,
containing
a
part
of
the
Cathedral
Close
and
a
few
old
houses
adjoining
.
<EOS>
The
church
is
a
singular
little
Gothic
building
,
perched
over
a
gateway
,
through
which
the
Close
is
entered
,
and
is
approached
by
a
flight
of
stone
steps
which
leads
down
under
the
archway
of
the
gate
.
<EOS>
It
is
no
bigger
than
an
ordinary
room
,
 
perhaps
twenty
-
seven
feet
long
by
eighteen
wide
,
 
but
still
it
is
a
perfect
church
.
<EOS>
It
contains
an
old
carved
pulpit
and
reading
-
desk
,
a
tiny
altar
under
a
window
filled
with
dark
old
-
coloured
glass
,
a
font
,
some
half
-
dozen
pews
,
and
perhaps
a
dozen
seats
for
the
poor
;
and
also
a
vestry
.
<EOS>
The
roof
is
high
pitched
,
and
of
black
old
oak
,
and
the
three
large
beams
which
support
it
run
down
to
the
side
walls
,
and
terminate
in
grotesquely
carved
faces
,
 
two
devils
and
an
angel
on
one
side
,
two
angels
and
a
devil
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
Such
is
the
church
of
St
Cuthbert
at
Barchester
,
of
which
Mr
Harding
became
rector
,
with
a
clear
income
of
seventy
-
five
pounds
a
year
.
  
<EOS>
Here
he
performs
afternoon
service
every
Sunday
,
and
administers
the
Sacrament
once
in
every
three
months
.
<EOS>
His
audience
is
not
large
;
and
,
had
they
been
so
,
he
could
not
have
accommodated
them
:
but
enough
come
to
fill
his
six
pews
,
and
on
the
front
seat
of
those
devoted
to
the
poor
is
always
to
be
seen
our
old
friend
Mr
Bunce
,
decently
arrayed
in
his
bedesman
's
gown
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
is
still
precentor
of
Barchester
;
and
it
is
very
rarely
the
case
that
those
who
attend
the
Sunday
morning
service
miss
the
gratification
of
hearing
him
chant
the
Litany
,
as
no
other
man
in
England
can
do
it
.
<EOS>
He
is
neither
a
discontented
nor
an
unhappy
man
;
he
still
inhabits
the
lodgings
to
which
he
went
on
leaving
the
hospital
,
but
he
now
has
them
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Three
months
after
that
time
Eleanor
became
Mrs
Bold
,
and
of
course
removed
to
her
husband
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
some
difficulties
to
be
got
over
on
the
occasion
of
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
,
who
could
not
so
soon
overcome
his
grief
,
would
not
be
persuaded
to
grace
the
ceremony
with
his
presence
,
but
he
allowed
his
wife
and
children
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
The
marriage
took
place
in
the
cathedral
,
and
the
bishop
himself
officiated
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
last
occasion
on
which
he
ever
did
so
;
and
,
though
he
still
lives
,
it
is
not
probable
that
he
will
ever
do
so
again
.
  
<EOS>
Not
long
after
the
marriage
,
perhaps
six
months
,
when
Eleanor
's
bridal
-
honours
were
fading
,
and
persons
were
beginning
to
call
her
Mrs
Bold
without
twittering
,
the
archdeacon
consented
to
meet
John
Bold
at
a
dinner
-
party
,
and
since
that
time
they
have
become
almost
friends
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
firmly
believes
that
his
brother
-
in
-
law
was
,
as
a
bachelor
,
an
infidel
,
an
unbeliever
in
the
great
truths
of
our
religion
;
but
that
matrimony
has
opened
his
eyes
,
as
it
has
those
of
others
.
<EOS>
And
Bold
is
equally
inclined
to
think
that
time
has
softened
the
asperities
of
the
archdeacon
's
character
.
<EOS>
Friends
though
they
are
,
they
do
not
often
revert
to
the
feud
of
the
hospital
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
,
we
say
,
is
not
an
unhappy
man
:
he
keeps
his
lodgings
,
but
they
are
of
little
use
to
him
,
except
as
being
the
one
spot
on
earth
which
he
calls
his
own
.
<EOS>
His
time
is
spent
chiefly
at
his
daughter
's
or
at
the
palace
;
he
is
never
left
alone
,
even
should
he
wish
to
be
so
;
and
within
a
twelvemonth
of
Eleanor
's
marriage
his
determination
to
live
at
his
own
lodging
had
been
so
far
broken
through
and
abandoned
,
that
he
consented
to
have
his
violoncello
permanently
removed
to
his
daughter
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
Every
other
day
a
message
is
brought
to
him
from
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
"
The
bishop
's
compliments
,
and
his
lordship
is
not
very
well
to
-
day
,
and
he
hopes
Mr
Harding
will
dine
with
him
.
"
<EOS>
This
bulletin
as
to
the
old
man
's
health
is
a
myth
;
for
though
he
is
over
eighty
<EOS>
he
is
never
ill
,
and
will
probably
die
some
day
,
as
a
spark
goes
out
,
gradually
and
without
a
struggle
.
<EOS>
Mr
Harding
does
dine
with
him
very
often
,
which
means
going
to
the
palace
at
three
and
remaining
till
ten
;
and
whenever
he
does
not
the
bishop
whines
,
and
says
that
the
port
wine
is
corked
,
and
complains
that
nobody
attends
to
him
,
and
frets
himself
off
to
bed
an
hour
before
his
time
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
long
before
the
people
of
Barchester
forgot
to
call
Mr
Harding
by
his
long
well
-
known
name
of
Warden
.
<EOS>
It
had
become
so
customary
to
say
Mr
Warden
,
that
it
was
not
easily
dropped
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
"
he
always
says
when
so
addressed
,
"
not
warden
now
,
only
precentor
.
