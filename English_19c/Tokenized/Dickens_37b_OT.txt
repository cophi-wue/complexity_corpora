Treats
of
the
place
where
Oliver
Twist
was
born
and
of
the
circumstances
attending
his
birth
.
 
<EOS>
Among
other
public
buildings
in
a
certain
town
,
which
for
many
reasons
it
will
be
prudent
to
refrain
from
mentioning
,
and
to
which
I
will
assign
no
fictitious
name
,
there
is
one
anciently
common
to
most
towns
,
great
or
small
:
 
to
wit
,
a
workhouse
;
and
in
this
workhouse
was
born
;
on
a
day
and
date
which
I
need
not
trouble
myself
to
repeat
,
inasmuch
as
it
can
be
of
no
possible
consequence
to
the
reader
,
in
this
stage
of
the
business
at
all
events
;
the
item
of
mortality
whose
name
is
prefixed
to
the
head
of
this
chapter
.
   
<EOS>
For
a
long
time
after
it
was
ushered
into
this
world
of
sorrow
and
trouble
,
by
the
parish
surgeon
,
it
remained
a
matter
of
considerable
doubt
whether
the
child
would
survive
to
bear
any
name
at
all
;
in
which
case
it
is
somewhat
more
than
probable
that
these
memoirs
would
never
have
appeared
;
or
,
if
they
had
,
that
being
comprised
within
a
couple
of
pages
,
they
would
have
possessed
the
inestimable
merit
of
being
the
most
concise
and
faithful
specimen
of
biography
,
extant
in
the
literature
of
any
age
or
country
.
   
<EOS>
Although
I
am
not
disposed
to
maintain
that
the
being
born
in
a
workhouse
,
is
in
itself
the
most
fortunate
and
enviable
circumstance
that
can
possibly
befall
a
human
being
,
I
do
mean
to
say
that
in
this
particular
instance
,
it
was
the
best
thing
for
Oliver
Twist
that
could
by
possibility
have
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
that
there
was
considerable
difficulty
in
inducing
Oliver
to
take
upon
himself
the
office
of
respiration
,
---
a
troublesome
practice
,
but
one
which
custom
has
rendered
necessary
to
our
easy
existence
;
and
for
some
time
he
lay
gasping
on
a
little
flock
mattress
,
rather
unequally
poised
between
this
world
and
the
next
:
 
the
balance
being
decidedly
in
favour
of
the
latter
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
if
,
during
this
brief
period
,
Oliver
had
been
surrounded
by
careful
grandmothers
,
anxious
aunts
,
experienced
nurses
,
and
doctors
of
profound
wisdom
,
he
would
most
inevitably
and
indubitably
have
been
killed
in
no
time
.
 
<EOS>
There
being
nobody
by
,
however
,
but
a
pauper
old
woman
,
who
was
rendered
rather
misty
by
an
unwonted
allowance
of
beer
;
and
a
parish
surgeon
who
did
such
matters
by
contract
;
<EOS>
Oliver
and
Nature
fought
out
the
point
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
result
was
,
that
,
after
a
few
struggles
,
Oliver
breathed
,
sneezed
,
and
proceeded
to
advertise
to
the
inmates
of
the
workhouse
the
fact
of
a
new
burden
having
been
imposed
 
upon
the
parish
,
by
setting
up
as
loud
a
cry
as
could
reasonably
have
been
expected
from
a
male
infant
who
had
not
been
possessed
of
that
very
useful
appendage
,
a
voice
,
for
a
much
longer
space
of
time
than
three
minutes
and
a
quarter
.
   
<EOS>
As
Oliver
gave
this
first
proof
of
the
free
and
proper
action
of
his
lungs
,
the
patchwork
coverlet
which
was
carelessly
flung
over
the
iron
bedstead
,
rustled
;
the
pale
face
of
a
young
woman
was
raised
feebly
from
the
pillow
;
and
a
faint
voice
imperfectly
articulated
the
words
<EOS>
,
"
Let
me
see
the
child
,
and
die
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
surgeon
had
been
sitting
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
fire
:
 
giving
the
palms
of
his
hands
a
warm
and
a
rub
alternately
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
young
woman
spoke
,
he
rose
,
and
advancing
to
the
bed
's
head
,
said
,
with
more
kindness
than
might
have
been
expected
of
him
:
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
must
not
talk
about
dying
yet
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
bless
her
dear
heart
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
the
nurse
,
hastily
depositing
in
her
pocket
a
green
glass
bottle
,
the
contents
of
which
she
had
been
tasting
in
a
corner
with
evident
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
bless
her
dear
heart
,
when
she
has
lived
as
long
as
I
have
,
sir
,
and
had
thirteen
children
of
her
own
,
and
all
on
'em
dead
except
two
,
and
them
in
the
wurkus
with
me
<EOS>
,
she
'll
know
better
than
to
take
on
in
that
way
,
bless
her
dear
heart
!
 
<EOS>
Think
what
it
is
to
be
a
mother
,
there
's
a
dear
young
lamb
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
Apparently
this
consolatory
perspective
of
a
mother
's
prospects
failed
in
producing
its
due
effect
.
 
<EOS>
The
patient
shook
her
head
,
and
stretched
out
her
hand
towards
the
child
.
   
<EOS>
The
surgeon
deposited
it
in
her
arms
.
 
<EOS>
She
imprinted
her
cold
white
lips
passionately
on
its
forehead
;
passed
her
hands
over
her
face
;
gazed
wildly
round
;
shuddered
;
fell
back
---
and
died
.
<EOS>
They
chafed
her
breast
,
hands
,
and
temples
;
but
the
blood
had
stopped
forever
.
 
<EOS>
They
talked
of
hope
and
comfort
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
strangers
too
long
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
over
,
Mrs
Thingummy
!
"
said
the
surgeon
at
last
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
poor
dear
,
so
it
is
!
"
said
the
nurse
,
picking
up
the
cork
of
the
green
bottle
,
which
had
fallen
out
on
the
pillow
,
as
she
stooped
to
take
up
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
mind
sending
up
to
me
,
if
the
child
cries
,
nurse
,
"
said
the
surgeon
,
putting
on
his
gloves
with
great
deliberation
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
likely
it
WILL
be
troublesome
.
 
<EOS>
Give
it
a
little
gruel
if
it
is
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
put
on
his
hat
,
and
,
pausing
by
the
bed
-
side
on
his
way
to
the
door
,
added
,
"
She
was
a
good
-
looking
girl
,
too
;
<EOS>
where
did
she
come
from
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
was
brought
here
last
night
,
"
replied
the
old
woman
,
"
by
the
overseer
's
order
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
found
lying
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
walked
some
distance
,
for
her
shoes
<EOS>
were
worn
to
pieces
;
but
where
she
came
from
,
or
where
she
was
going
to
,
nobody
knows
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
surgeon
leaned
over
the
body
,
and
raised
the
left
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
old
story
,
"
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
:
 
"
no
wedding
-
ring
<EOS>
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Good
-
night
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
medical
gentleman
walked
away
to
dinner
;
and
the
nurse
,
having
once
more
applied
herself
to
the
green
bottle
,
sat
down
on
a
low
chair
before
the
fire
,
and
proceeded
to
dress
the
infant
.
   
<EOS>
What
an
excellent
example
of
the
power
of
dress
,
young
Oliver
Twist
was
!
 
<EOS>
Wrapped
in
the
blanket
which
had
hitherto
formed
his
only
covering
,
he
might
have
been
the
child
of
a
nobleman
or
a
beggar
;
it
would
have
been
hard
for
the
haughtiest
stranger
to
have
assigned
him
his
proper
station
in
society
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
that
he
was
enveloped
in
the
old
calico
robes
which
had
grown
yellow
in
the
same
service
,
he
was
badged
and
ticketed
,
and
fell
into
his
place
at
once
---
a
parish
child
---
the
orphan
of
a
workhouse
---
the
humble
,
half
-
starved
drudge
---
to
be
cuffed
and
buffeted
through
the
world
---
despised
by
all
,
and
pitied
by
none
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
cried
lustily
.
<EOS>
If
he
could
have
known
that
he
was
an
orphan
,
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
church
-
wardens
and
overseers
,
perhaps
he
would
have
cried
the
louder
.

<EOS>
Treats
of
Oliver
Twist
's
growth
,
education
,
and
board
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
next
eight
or
ten
months
,
Oliver
was
the
victim
of
a
systematic
course
of
treachery
and
deception
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
brought
up
by
hand
.
 
<EOS>
The
hungry
and
destitute
situation
of
the
infant
orphan
was
duly
reported
by
the
workhouse
authorities
to
the
parish
authorities
.
 
<EOS>
The
parish
authorities
inquired
with
dignity
of
the
workhouse
authorities
,
whether
there
was
no
female
then
domiciled
in
"
the
house
"
who
was
in
a
situation
to
impart
to
Oliver
Twist
,
the
consolation
and
nourishment
of
which
he
stood
in
need
.
 
<EOS>
The
workhouse
authorities
replied
with
humility
,
that
there
was
not
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
parish
authorities
magnanimously
and
humanely
resolved
,
that
Oliver
should
be
"
farmed
,
"
or
,
in
other
words
,
that
he
should
be
dispatched
to
a
branch
-
workhouse
some
three
miles
off
,
where
twenty
or
thirty
other
juvenile
offenders
against
the
poor
-
laws
,
rolled
about
the
floor
all
day
,
without
the
inconvenience
of
too
much
food
or
too
much
clothing
,
under
the
parental
superintendence
of
an
elderly
female
,
who
received
the
culprits
at
and
for
the
consideration
of
sevenpence
-
halfpenny
per
small
head
per
week
.
 
<EOS>
Sevenpence
-
halfpenny
's
worth
per
week
is
a
good
round
diet
for
a
child
;
a
great
deal
may
be
got
for
sevenpence
-
halfpenny
,
quite
enough
to
overload
its
stomach
,
and
make
it
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
The
elderly
female
was
a
woman
of
wisdom
and
experience
;
she
knew
what
was
good
for
children
;
and
she
had
a
very
accurate
perception
of
what
was
good
for
herself
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
she
appropriated
the
greater
part
of
the
weekly
stipend
to
her
own
use
,
and
consigned
the
rising
parochial
generation
to
even
a
shorter
allowance
than
was
originally
provided
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
Thereby
finding
in
the
lowest
depth
a
deeper
still
;
and
proving
herself
a
very
great
experimental
philosopher
.
   
<EOS>
Everybody
knows
the
story
of
another
experimental
philosopher
who
had
a
great
theory
about
a
horse
being
able
to
live
without
eating
,
and
who
demonstrated
it
so
well
,
that
he
had
got
his
own
horse
down
to
a
straw
a
day
,
and
would
unquestionably
have
rendered
him
a
very
spirited
and
rampacious
animal
on
nothing
at
all
,
if
he
had
not
died
,
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
before
he
was
to
have
had
his
first
comfortable
bait
of
air
.
 
<EOS>
Unfortunately
for
,
the
experimenal
philosophy
of
the
female
to
whose
protecting
care
Oliver
Twist
was
delivered
over
,
a
similar
result
usually
attended
the
operation
of
HER
system
;
for
at
the
very
moment
when
the
child
had
contrived
to
exist
upon
the
smallest
possible
portion
of
the
weakest
possible
food
,
it
did
perversely
happen
in
eight
and
a
half
cases
out
of
ten
,
either
that
it
sickened
from
want
and
cold
,
or
fell
into
the
fire
from
neglect
,
or
got
half
-
smothered
by
accident
;
in
any
one
of
which
cases
,
the
miserable
little
being
was
usually
summoned
into
another
world
,
and
there
gathered
to
the
fathers
it
had
never
known
in
this
.
   
<EOS>
Occasionally
,
when
there
was
some
more
than
usually
interesting
inquest
upon
a
parish
child
who
had
been
overlooked
in
turning
up
a
bedstead
,
or
inadvertently
scalded
to
death
when
there
happened
to
be
a
washing
---
though
the
latter
accident
was
very
scarce
,
anything
approaching
to
a
washing
being
of
rare
occurance
in
the
farm
---
the
jury
would
take
it
into
their
heads
to
ask
troublesome
questions
,
or
the
parishioners
would
rebelliously
affix
their
signatures
to
a
remonstrance
.
 
<EOS>
But
these
impertinences
were
speedily
checked
by
the
evidence
of
the
surgeon
,
and
the
testimony
of
the
beadle
;
the
former
of
whom
had
always
opened
the
body
and
found
nothing
inside
(
which
was
very
probable
indeed
)
,
and
the
latter
of
whom
invariably
swore
whatever
the
parish
wanted
;
which
was
very
self
-
devotional
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
board
made
periodical
pilgrimages
to
the
farm
,
and
always
sent
the
beadle
the
day
before
,
to
say
they
were
going
.
 
<EOS>
The
children
were
neat
and
clean
to
behold
,
when
THEY
went
;
and
what
more
would
the
people
have
!
   
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
expected
that
this
system
of
farming
would
produce
any
very
extraordinary
or
luxuriant
crop
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
Twist
's
ninth
birthday
found
him
a
pale
thin
child
,
somewhat
diminutive
in
stature
,
and
decidely
small
in
circumference
.
 
<EOS>
But
nature
or
inheritance
had
implanted
a
good
sturdy
spirit
in
Oliver
's
breast
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
had
plenty
of
room
to
expand
,
thanks
to
the
spare
diet
of
the
establishment
;
and
perhaps
to
this
circumstance
may
be
attributed
his
having
any
ninth
birth
-
day
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
<EOS>
,
however
,
it
was
his
ninth
birthday
;
and
he
was
keeping
it
in
the
coal
-
cellar
with
a
select
party
of
two
other
young
gentleman
,
who
,
after
participating
with
him
in
a
sound
thrashing
,
had
been
locked
up
for
atrociously
presuming
to
be
hungry
,
when
Mrs
Mann
,
the
good
lady
of
the
house
,
was
unexpectedly
startled
by
the
apparition
of
Mr
Bumble
,
the
beadle
,
striving
to
undo
the
wicket
of
the
garden
-
gate
.
   
<EOS>
"
Goodness
gracious
!
 
<EOS>
Is
that
you
,
Mr
Bumble
,
sir
?
"
said
Mrs
Mann
,
thrusting
her
head
out
of
the
window
in
well
-
affected
ecstasies
of
joy
.
 
<EOS>
"
(
Susan
,
take
Oliver
and
them
two
brats
upstairs
,
and
wash
'em
directly
.
)
<EOS>
---
My
heart
alive
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
,
<EOS>
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you
,
sure
-
ly
!
"
   
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr
Bumble
was
a
fat
man
,
and
a
choleric
;
so
,
instead
of
responding
to
this
open
-
hearted
salutation
in
a
kindred
spirit
,
he
gave
the
little
wicket
a
tremendous
shake
,
and
then
bestowed
upon
it
a
kick
which
could
have
emanated
from
no
leg
but
a
beadle
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
,
only
think
,
"
said
Mrs
Mann
,
running
out
,
---
for
the
three
boys
had
been
removed
by
this
time
,
---
"
only
think
of
that
!
 
<EOS>
That
I
should
have
forgotten
that
the
gate
was
bolted
on
the
inside
,
on
account
of
them
<EOS>
dear
children
!

Although
this
invitation
was
accompanied
with
a
curtsey
that
might
have
softened
the
heart
of
a
church
-
warden
,
it
by
no
means
mollified
the
beadle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
this
respectful
or
proper
conduct
,
Mrs
Mann
,
"
inquired
Mr
Bumble
,
grasping
his
cane
,
"
to
keep
the
parish
officers
a
waiting
at
your
garden
-
gate
,
when
they
come
here
upon
porochial
business
with
the
porochial
orphans
?
 
<EOS>
Are
you
aweer
,
Mrs
Mann
,
that
you
are
,
as
I
may
say
,
a
porochial
delegate
,
and
a
stipendiary
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
,
that
I
was
only
a
telling
one
or
two
of
the
dear
children
as
is
so
fond
of
you
,
that
it
was
you
a
coming
,
"
replied
Mrs
Mann
with
great
humility
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
had
a
great
idea
of
his
oratorical
powers
and
his
importance
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
displayed
the
one
,
and
vindicated
the
other
.
<EOS>
He
relaxed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
Mrs
Mann
,
"
he
replied
in
a
calmer
tone
;
"
it
may
be
as
you
say
;
it
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
Lead
the
way
in
,
Mrs
Mann
,
for
I
come
on
business
,
and
have
something
to
say
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Mann
ushered
the
beadle
into
a
small
parlour
with
a
brick
floor
;
placed
a
seat
for
him
;
and
officiously
deposited
his
cocked
hat
and
can
on
the
table
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
wiped
from
his
forehead
the
perspiration
which
his
walk
had
engendered
,
glanced
complacently
at
the
cocked
hat
,
and
smiled
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
he
smiled
.
 
<EOS>
Beadles
are
but
men
:
and
Mr
Bumble
smiled
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
do
n't
you
be
offended
at
what
I
'm
a
going
to
say
,
"
observed
Mrs
Mann
,
with
captivating
sweetness
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
had
a
long
walk
,
you
know
,
or
I
would
n't
mention
it
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
will
you
take
a
little
drop
of
somethink
,
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Not
a
drop
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
a
drop
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
waving
his
right
hand
in
a
dignified
,
but
placid
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
will
,
"
said
Mrs
Mann
,
who
had
noticed
the
tone
of
the
refusal
,
and
the
gesture
that
had
accompanied
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Just
a
leetle
drop
,
with
a
little
cold
water
,
and
a
lump
of
sugar
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
coughed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
just
a
leetle
drop
,
"
said
Mrs
Mann
persuasively
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
beadle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
it
's
what
I
'm
obliged
to
keep
a
little
of
in
the
house
,
to
put
into
the
blessed
infants
'
Daffy
,
when
they
ai
n't
well
,
Mr
Bumble
,
"
replied
Mrs
Mann
as
she
opened
a
corner
cupboard
,
and
took
down
a
bottle
and
glass
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
gin
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
not
deceive
you
,
<EOS>
Mr
B.
 
It
's
gin
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
give
the
children
Daffy
,
Mrs
Mann
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Bumble
,
following
with
this
eyes
the
interesting
process
of
mixing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
bless
'em
,
that
I
do
,
dear
as
it
is
,
"
replied
the
nurse
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
see
'em
suffer
before
my
very
eyes
,
you
know
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
"
;
said
Mr
Bumble
approvingly
;
"
no
,
you
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
humane
woman
,
Mrs
Mann
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
Here
she
set
down
the
glass
.
)
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
take
a
early
opportunity
of
mentioning
it
to
the
board
,
Mrs
Mann
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
He
drew
it
towards
him
.
)
 
<EOS>
"
You
feel
as
a
mother
,
Mrs
Mann
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
He
stirred
the
gin
-
and
-
water
.
)
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
drink
your
health
with
cheerfulness
,
Mrs
Mann
"
;
and
he
swallowed
half
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
now
about
business
,
"
said
the
beadle
,
taking
out
a
leathern
pocket
-
book
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
child
that
was
half
-
baptized
Oliver
Twist
,
is
nine
year
old
to

day
.
<EOS>
;
   
"
Bless
him

"
<EOS>
interposed
Mrs
Mann
,
inflaming
her
left
eye
with
the
corner
of
her
apron
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
notwithstanding
a
offered
reward
of
ten
pound
,
which
was
afterwards
increased
to
twenty
pound
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
most
superlative
,
and
,
I
may
say
,
supernat'ral
exertions
on
the
part
of
this
parish
,
"
said
Bumble
,
<EOS>
"
we
have
never
been
able
to
discover
who
is
his
father
,
or
what
was
his
mother
's
settlement
,
name
,
or
con

dition
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Mann
raised
her
hands
in
astonishment
;
but
added
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
,
"
How
comes
he
to
have
any
name
at
all
,
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
beadle
drew
himself
up
with
great
pride
,
and
said
,
"
I
inwented
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
,
Mr
Bumble
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
,
Mrs
Mann
.
 
<EOS>
We
name
our
fondlings
in
alphabetical
order
.
<EOS>
The
last
was
a
S^

---
<EOS>
Swubble

I
named
him

<EOS>
This
was
a
T^

<EOS>
Twist
,
I
named
HIM

<EOS>
The
next
one
comes
will
be
Unwin
,
and
the
next
Vilkins
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
got
names
ready
made
to
the
end
of
the
alphabet
,
and
all
the
way
through
it
again
,
when
we
come
to
Z^.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
're
quite
a
literary
character
,
sir
!
"
said
Mrs
Mann
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
said
the
beadle
,
evidently
gratified
with
the
compliment
;
"
perhaps
I
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
may
be
,
Mrs
Mann
.
"
<EOS>
He
finished
the
gin
-
and
-
water
,
and
added
,
"
Oliver
being
now
too
old
to
remain
here
,
the
board
have
determined
to
have
him
back
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
come
out
myself
to
take
him
there
.
 
<EOS>
So
let
me
see
him
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
fetch
him
directly
,
"
said
Mrs
Mann
,
leaving
the
room
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
,
having
had
by
this
time
as
much
of
the
outer
coat
of
dirt
which
encrusted
his
face
and
hands
,
removed
,
as
could
be
scrubbed
off
in
one
washing
,
was
led
into
the
room
by
his
benevolent
protectress
.
   
<EOS>
"
Make
a
bow
to
the
gentleman
,
Oliver
,
"
said
Mrs
Mann
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
made
a
bow
,
which
was
divided
between
the
beadle
on
the
chair
,
and
the
cocked
hat
on
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
go
along
with
me
,
Oliver
?
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
in
a
majestic
voice
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
was
about
to
say
that
he
would
go
along
with
anybody
with
great
readiness
,
when
,
glancing
upward
,
he
caught
sight
of
Mrs
Mann
,
who
had
got
behind
the
beadle
's
chair
,
and
was
shaking
her
fist
at
him
with
a
furious
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
the
hint
at
once
,
for
the
fist
had
been
too
often
impressed
upon
his
body
not
to
be
deeply
impressed
upon
his
recollection
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
she
go
with
me
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
poor
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
she
ca
n't
,
"
replied
Mr
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
she
'll
come
and
see
you
sometimes
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
no
very
great
consolation
to
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
Young
as
he
was
,
however
,
he
had
sense
enough
to
make
a
feint
of
feeling
great
regret
at
going
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
no
very
difficult
matter
for
the
boy
to
call
tears
into
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Hunger
and
recent
ill
-
usage
are
great
assistants
if
you
want
to
cry
;
and
Oliver
cried
very
naturally
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Mann
gave
him
a
thousand
embraces
,
and
what
Oliver
wanted
a
great
deal
more
,
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
,
less
he
should
seem
too
hungry
when
he
got
to
the
workhouse
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
slice
of
bread
in
his
hand
,
and
the
little
brown
-
cloth
parish
cap
on
his
head
,
Oliver
was
then
led
away
by
Mr
Bumble
from
the
wretched
home
where
one
kind
word
or
look
had
never
lighted
the
gloom
of
his
infant
years
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
he
burst
into
an
agony
of
childish
grief
,
as
the
cottage
-
gate
closed
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
Wretched
as
were
the
little
companions
in
misery
he
was
leaving
behind
<EOS>
,
they
were
the
only
friends
he
had
ever
known
;
and
a
sense
of
his
loneliness
in
the
great
wide
world
,
sank
into
the
child
's
heart
for
the
first
time
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
walked
on
with
long
strides
;
little
Oliver
,
firmly
grasping
his
gold
-
laced
cuff
,
trotted
beside
him
,
inquiring
at
the
end
of
every
quarter
of
a
mile
whether
they
were
"
nearly
there
.
"
<EOS>
To
these
interrogations
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
returned
very
brief
and
snappish
replies
;
for
the
temporary
blandness
which
gin
-
and
-
water
awakens
in
some
bosoms
had
by
this
time
evaporated
;
and
he
was
once
again
a
beadle
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
had
not
been
within
the
walls
of
the
workhouse
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
had
scarcely
completed
the
demolition
of
a
second
slice
of
bread
,
when
Mr
Bumble
,
who
had
handed
him
over
to
the
care
of
an
old
woman
,
returned
;
and
,
telling
him
it
was
a
board
night
,
informed
him
that
the
board
had
said
he
was
to
appear
before
it
forthwith
.
   
<EOS>
Not
having
a
very
clearly
defined
notion
of
what
a
live
board
was
,
Oliver
was
rather
astounded
by
this
intelligence
,
and
was
not
quite
certain
whether
he
ought
to
laugh
or
cry
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
time
to
think
about
the
matter
,
however
;
for
Mr
Bumble
gave
him
a
tap
on
the
head
,
with
his
cane
,
to
wake
him
up
:
and
another
on
the
back
to
make
him
lively
:
 
and
bidding
him
to
follow
,
conducted
him
into
a
large
white
-
washed
room
,
where
eight
or
ten
fat
gentlemen
were
sitting
round
a
table
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
top
of
the
table
,
seated
in
an
arm
-
chair
rather
higher
than
the
rest
,
was
a
particularly
fat
gentleman
with
a
very
round
,
red
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bow
to
the
board
,
"
said
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
brushed
away
two
or
three
tears
that
were
lingering
in
his
eyes
;
and
seeing
no
board
but
the
table
,
fortunately
bowed
to
that
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
your
name
,
boy
?
"
said
the
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
was
frightened
at
the
sight
of
so
many
gentlemen
,
which
made
him
tremble
:
 
and
the
beadle
gave
him
another
tap
behind
,
which
made
him
cry
.
 
<EOS>
These
two
causes
made
him
answer
in
a
very
low
and
hesitating
voice
;
whereupon
a
gentleman
in
a
white
waistcoat
said
he
was
a
fool
.
 
<EOS>
Which
was
a
capital
way
of
raising
his
spirits
,
and
putting
him
quite
at
his
ease
.
   
<EOS>
"
Boy
,
"
said
the
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
,
"
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
know
you
're
an
orphan
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
,
sir
?
"
inquired
poor
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
boy
IS
a
fool
---
I
thought
he
was
,
"
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
gentleman
who
had
spoken
first
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
you
've
got
no
father
or
mother
,
and
that
you
were
brought
up
by
the
parish
,
do
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
,
weeping
bitterly
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
crying
for
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
be
sure
it
was
very
extraordinary
.
 
<EOS>
What
COULD
the
boy
be
crying
for
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
say
your
prayers
every
night
,
"
said
another
gentleman
in
a
gruff
voice
;
"
and
pray
for
the
people
who
feed
you
,
and
take
care
of
you
---
like
a
Christian
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
stammered
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
who
spoke
last
was
unconsciously
right
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
very
like
a
Christian
,
and
a
marvellously
good
Christian
too
,
if
Oliver
had
prayed
for
the
people
who
fed
and
took
care
of
HIM
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
n't
,
because
nobody
had
taught
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
come
here
to
be
educated
,
and
taught
a
useful
trade
,
"
said
the
red
-
faced
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
you
'll
begin
to
pick
oakum
to
-
morrow
morning
at
six
o'clock
,
"
added
the
surly
one
in
the
white
waistcoat
.
   
<EOS>
For
the
combination
of
both
these
blessings
in
the
one
simple
process
of
picking
oakum
,
Oliver
bowed
low
by
the
direction
of
the
beadle
,
and
was
then
hurried
away
to
a
large
ward
;
where
,
on
a
rough
,
hard
bed
,
he
sobbed
himself
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
novel
illustration
of
the
tender
laws
of
England
!
 
<EOS>
They
let
the
paupers
go
to
sleep
!
   
<EOS>
Poor
Oliver
!
 
<EOS>
He
little
thought
,
as
he
lay
sleeping
in
happy
unconsciousness
of
all
around
him
,
that
the
board
had
that
very
day
arrived
at
a
decision
which
would
exercise
the
most
material
influence
over
all
his
future
fortunes
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
had
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
was
it
:
   
<EOS>
The
members
of
this
board
were
very
sage
,
deep
,
philosophical
men
;
and
when
they
came
to
turn
their
attention
to
the
workhouse
,
they
found
out
at
once
,
what
ordinary
folks
would
nver
have
discovered
---
the
poor
people
liked
it
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
regular
place
of
public
entertainment
for
the
poorer
classes
;
a
tavern
where
there
was
nothing
to
pay
;
a
public
breakfast
,
dinner
,
tea
,
and
supper
all
the
year
round
;
a
brick
and
mortar
elysium
,
where
it
was
all
play
and
no
work
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oho
!
"
said
the
board
,
looking
very
knowing
;
"
we
are
the
fellows
to
set
this
to
rights
;
we
'll
stop
it
all
,
in
no
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
,
they
established
the
rule
,
that
all
poor
people
should
have
the
alternative
(
for
they
would
compel
nobody
,
not
they
)
,
of
being
starved
by
a
gradual
process
in
the
house
,
or
by
a
quick
one
out
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
they
contracted
with
the
water
-
works
to
lay
on
an
unlimited
supply
of
water
;
and
with
a
corn
-
factor
to
supply
periodically
small
quantities
of
oatmeal
;
and
issued
three
meals
of
thin
gruel
a
day
,
with
an
onion
twice
a
week
,
and
half
a
roll
of
Sundays
.
 
<EOS>
They
made
a
great
many
other
wise
and
humane
regulations
,
having
reference
to
the
ladies
,
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
repeat
;
kindly
undertook
to
divorce
poor
married
people
,
in
consequence
of
the
great
expense
of
a
suit
in
Doctors
'
Commons
;
and
,
instead
of
compelling
a
man
to
support
his
family
,
as
they
had
theretofore
done
,
took
his
family
away
from
him
,
and
made
him
a
bachelor
!
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
saying
how
many
applicants
for
relief
,
under
these
last
two
heads
,
might
have
started
up
in
all
classes
of
society
,
if
it
had
not
been
coupled
with
the
workhouse
;
but
the
board
were
long
-
headed
men
,
and
had
provided
for
this
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
The
relief
was
inseparable
from
the
workhouse
and
the
gruel
;
and
that
frightened
people
.
   
<EOS>
For
the
first
six
months
after
Oliver
Twist
was
removed
,
the
system
was
in
full
operation
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
rather
expensive
at
first
,
in
consequence
of
the
increase
in
the
undertaker
's
bill
,
and
the
necessity
of
taking
in
the
clothes
of
all
the
paupers
,
which
fluttered
loosely
on
their
wasted
,
shrunken
forms
,
after
a
week
or
two
's
gruel
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
number
of
workhouse
inmates
got
thin
as
well
as
the
paupers
;
and
the
board
were
in
ecstasies
.
   
<EOS>
The
room
in
which
the
boys
were
fed
,
was
a
large
stone
hall
,
with
a
copper
at
one
end
:
 
out
of
which
the
master
,
dressed
in
an
apron
for
the
purpose
,
and
assisted
by
one
or
two
women
,
ladled
the
gruel
at
mealtimes
.
 
<EOS>
Of
this
festive
composition
each
boy
had
one
porringer
,
and
no
more
---
except
on
occasions
of
great
public
rejoicing
,
when
he
had
two
ounces
and
a
quarter
of
bread
besides
.
   
<EOS>
The
bowls
never
wanted
washing
.
 
<EOS>
The
boys
polished
them
with
their
spoons
till
they
shone
again
;
and
when
they
had
performed
this
operation
(
which
never
took
very
long
,
the
spoons
being
nearly
as
large
as
the
bowls
)
,
they
would
sit
staring
at
the
copper
,
with
such
eager
eyes
,
as
if
they
could
have
devoured
the
very
bricks
of
which
it
was
composed
;
employing
themselves
,
meanwhile
,
in
sucking
their
fingers
most
assiduously
,
with
the
view
of
catching
up
any
stray
splashes
of
gruel
that
might
have
been
cast
thereon
.
 
<EOS>
Boys
have
generally
excellent
appetites
.
<EOS>
Oliver
Twist
and
his
companions
suffered
the
tortures
of
slow
starvation
for
three
months
:
 
<EOS>
at
last
they
got
so
voracious
and
wild
with
hunger
,
that
one
boy
,
who
was
tall
for
his
age
,
and
had
n't
been
used
to
that
sort
of
thing
(
for
his
father
had
kept
a
small
cook
-
shop
)
,
hinted
darkly
to
his
companions
,
that
unless
he
had
another
basin
of
gruel
per
diem
,
he
was
afraid
he
might
some
night
happen
to
eat
the
boy
who
slept
next
him
,
who
happened
to
be
a
weakly
youth
of
tender
age
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
wild
,
hungry
eye
;
and
they
implicitly
believed
him
.
<EOS>
A
council
was
held
;
lots
were
cast
who
should
walk
up
to
the
master
after
supper
that
evening
,
and
ask
for
more
;
and
it
fell
to
Oliver
Twist
.
   
<EOS>
The
evening
arrived
;
the
boys
took
their
places
.
 
<EOS>
The
master
,
in
his
cook
's
uniform
,
stationed
himself
at
the
copper
;
his
pauper
assistants
ranged
themselves
behind
him
;
the
gruel
was
served
out
;
and
a
long
grace
was
said
over
the
short
commons
.
 
<EOS>
The
gruel
disappeared
;
the
boys
whispered
each
other
,
and
winked
at
Oliver
;
while
his
next
neighbours
nudged
him
.
 
<EOS>
Child
<EOS>
as
he
was
,
he
was
desperate
with
hunger
,
and
reckless
with
misery
.
 
<EOS>
He
rose
from
the
table
;
and
advancing
to
the
master
,
basin
and
spoon
in
hand
,
said
:
 
somewhat
alarmed
at
his
own
temerity
:
   
<EOS>
"
Please
,
sir
,
I
want
some
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
master
was
a
fat
,
healthy
man
;
but
he
turned
very
pale
.
<EOS>
He
gazed
in
stupified
astonishment
on
the
small
rebel
for
some
seconds
,
and
then
clung
for
support
to
the
copper
.
 
<EOS>
The
assistants
were
paralysed
with
wonder
;
the
boys
with
fear
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
the
master
at
length
,
in
a
faint
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Please
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
,
"
I
want
some
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
master
aimed
a
blow
at
Oliver
's
head
with
the
ladle
;
pinioned
him
in
his
arm
;
and
shrieked
aloud
for
the
beadle
.
   
<EOS>
The
board
were
sitting
in
solemn
conclave
,
when
Mr
Bumble
rushed
into
the
room
in
great
excitement
,
and
addressing
the
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
,
said
,
   
"
<EOS>
Mr
Limbkins
,
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
Oliver
Twist
has
asked
for
more
!
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
general
start
.
 
<EOS>
Horror
was
depicted
on
every
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
MORE
!
"
said
Mr
Limbkins
.
 
<EOS>
"
Compose
yourself
,
Bumble
,
and
answer
me
distinctly
.
 
<EOS>
Do
I
understand
that
he
asked
for
more
,
after
he
had
eaten
the
supper
allotted
by
the
dietary
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
did
,
sir
,
"
replied
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
boy
will
be
hung
,
"
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
boy
will
be
hung
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nobody
controverted
the
prophetic
gentleman
's
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
An
animated
discussion
took
place
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
was
ordered
into
instant
confinement
;
and
a
bill
was
next
morning
pasted
on
the
outside
of
the
gate
,
offering
a
reward
of
five
pounds
to
anybody
who
would
take
Oliver
Twist
off
the
hands
of
the
parish
.
 
<EOS>
In
other
words
,
five
pounds
and
Oliver
Twist
were
offered
to
any
man
or
woman
who
wanted
an
apprentice
to
any
trade
,
business
,
or
calling
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
was
more
convinced
of
anything
in
my
life
,
"
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
,
as
he
knocked
at
the
gate
and
read
the
bill
next
morning
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
was
more
convinced
of
anything
in
my
life
,
than
I
am
that
that
boy
will
come
to
be
hung
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
I
purpose
to
show
in
the
sequel
whether
the
white
waistcoated
gentleman
was
right
or
not
,
I
should
perhaps
mar
the
interest
of
this
narrative
(
supposing
it
to
possess
any
at
all
)
,
if
I
ventured
to
hint
just
yet
,
whether
the
life
of
Oliver
Twist
had
this
violent
termination
or
no
.
    
Chapter
3
.
<EOS>
Relates
how
Oliver
Twist
was
very
near
getting
a
place
which
Would
not
have
been
a
sinecure
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
week
after
the
commission
of
the
impious
and
profane
offence
of
asking
for
more
,
Oliver
remained
a
close
prisoner
in
the
dark
and
solitary
room
to
which
he
had
been
consigned
by
the
wisdom
and
mercy
of
the
board
.
 
<EOS>
It
appears
,
at
first
sight
not
unreasonable
to
suppose
,
that
,
if
he
had
entertained
a
becoming
feeling
of
respect
for
the
prediction
of
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
,
he
would
have
established
that
sage
individual
's
prophetic
character
,
once
and
for
ever
,
by
tying
one
end
of
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
to
a
hook
in
the
wall
,
and
attaching
himself
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
To
the
performance
of
this
feat
,
however
,
there
was
one
obstacle
:
 
<EOS>
namely
,
that
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
being
decided
articles
of
luxury
,
had
been
,
for
all
future
times
and
ages
,
removed
from
the
noses
of
paupers
by
the
express
order
of
the
board
,
in
council
assembled
:
 
solemnly
given
and
pronounced
under
their
hands
and
seals
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
still
greater
obstacle
in
Oliver
's
youth
and
childishness
.
 
<EOS>
He
only
cried
bitterly
all
day
;
and
,
when
the
long
,
dismal
night
came
on
,
spread
his
little
hands
before
his
eyes
to
shut
out
the
darkness
,
and
crouching
in
the
corner
,
tried
to
sleep
:
 
ever
and
anon
waking
with
a
start
and
tremble
,
and
drawing
himself
closer
and
closer
to
the
wall
,
as
if
to
feel
even
its
cold
hard
surface
were
a
protection
in
the
gloom
and
loneliness
which
surrounded
him
.
   
<EOS>
Let
it
not
be
supposed
by
the
enemies
of
"
the
system
,
"
that
,
during
the
period
of
his
solitary
incarceration
,
Oliver
was
denied
the
benefit
of
exercise
,
the
pleasure
of
society
,
or
the
advantages
of
religious
consolation
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
exercise
,
it
was
nice
cold
weather
,
and
he
was
allowed
to
perform
his
ablutions
every
morning
under
the
pump
,
in
a
stone
yard
,
in
the
presence
of
Mr
Bumble
,
who
prevented
his
catching
cold
,
and
caused
a
tingling
sensation
to
pervade
his
frame
,
by
repeated
applications
of
the
cane
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
society
,
he
was
carried
every
other
day
into
the
hall
where
the
boys
dined
,
and
there
sociably
flogged
as
a
public
warning
and
example
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
for
from
being
denied
the
advantages
of
religious
consolation
,
he
was
kicked
into
the
same
apartment
every
evening
at
prayer
-
time
,
and
there
permitted
to
listen
to
,
and
console
his
mind
with
,
a
general
supplication
of
the
boys
,
containing
a
special
clause
,
therein
inserted
by
authority
of
the
board
,
in
which
they
entreated
to
be
made
good
,
virtuous
,
contented
,
and
obedient
,
and
to
be
guarded
from
the
sins
and
vices
of
Oliver
Twist
:
 
whom
the
supplication
distinctly
set
forth
to
be
under
the
exclusive
patronage
and
protection
of
the
powers
of
wickedness
,
and
an
article
direct
from
the
manufactory
of
the
very
Devil
himself
.
   
<EOS>
It
chanced
one
morning
,
while
Oliver
's
affairs
were
in
this
auspicious
and
confortable
state
,
that
Mr
Gamfield
,
chimney
-
sweep
,
went
his
way
down
the
High
Street
,
deeply
cogitating
in
his
mind
his
ways
and
means
of
paying
certain
arrears
of
rent
,
for
which
his
landlord
had
become
rather
pressing
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gamfield
's
most
sanguine
estimate
of
his
finances
could
not
raise
them
within
full
five
pounds
of
the
desired
amount
;
and
,
in
a
species
of
arthimetical
desperation
,
he
was
alternately
cudgelling
his
brains
and
his
donkey
,
when
passing
the
workhouse
,
his
eyes
encountered
the
bill
on
the
gate
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wo
---
o
!
"
said
Mr
Gamfield
to
the
donkey
.
   
<EOS>
The
donkey
was
in
a
state
of
profound
abstraction
:
 
wondering
,
probably
,
whether
he
was
destined
to
be
regaled
with
a
cabbage
-
stalk
or
two
when
he
had
disposed
of
the
two
sacks
of
soot
with
which
the
little
cart
was
laden
;
so
,
without
noticing
the
word
of
command
,
he
jogged
onward
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gamfield
growled
a
fierce
imprecation
on
the
donkey
generally
,
but
more
particularly
on
his
eyes
;
and
,
running
after
him
,
bestowed
a
blow
on
his
head
,
which
would
inevitably
have
beaten
in
any
skull
but
a
donkey
's
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
catching
hold
of
the
bridle
,
he
gave
his
jaw
a
sharp
wrench
,
by
way
of
gentle
reminder
that
he
was
not
his
own
master
;
and
by
these
means
turned
him
round
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
gave
him
another
blow
on
the
head
,
just
to
stun
him
till
he
came
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
Having
completed
these
arrangements
,
he
walked
up
to
the
gate
,
to
read
the
bill
.
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
with
the
white
waistcoat
was
standing
at
the
gate
with
his
hands
behind
him
,
after
having
delivered
himself
of
some
profound
sentiments
in
the
board
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
Having
witnessed
the
little
dispute
between
Mr
Gamfield
and
the
donkey
,
he
smiled
joyously
when
that
person
came
up
to
read
the
bill
,
for
he
saw
at
once
that
Mr
Gamfield
was
exactly
the
sort
of
master
Oliver
Twist
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gamfield
smiled
,
too
,
as
he
perused
the
document
;
for
five
pounds
was
just
the
sum
he
had
been
wishing
for
;
and
,
as
to
the
boy
with
which
it
was
encumbered
,
Mr
Gamfield
,
knowing
what
the
dietary
of
the
workhouse
was
<EOS>
,
well
knew
he
would
be
a
nice
small
pattern
,
just
the
very
thing
for
register
stoves
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
spelt
the
bill
through
again
,
from
beginning
to
end
;
and
then
,
touching
his
fur
cap
in
token
of
humility
,
accosted
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
here
boy
,
sir
,
wot
the
parish
wants
to
'
prentis
,
"
said
Mr
Gamfield
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
my
man
,
"
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
,
with
a
condescending
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
of
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
the
parish
vould
like
him
to
learn
a
right

Mr

"
I

I

him

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Walk
in
,
"
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gamfield
having
lingered
behind
,
to
give
the
donkey
another
blow
on
the
head
,
and
another
wrench
of
the
jaw
,
as
a
caution
not
to
run
away
in
his
absence
,
followed
the
gentleman
with
the
white
waistcoat
into
the
room
where
Oliver
had
first
seen
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
nasty
trade
,
"
said
Mr
Limbkins
,
when
Gamfield
had
again
stated
his
wish
.
   
<EOS>
"
Young
boys
have
been
smothered
in
chimneys
before
now
,
"
said
another
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
acause
they
damped
the
straw
afore
<EOS>
they
lit
it
in
the
chimbley
to
make
'em
come
down
again
,
"
said
Gamfield
;
"
that
's
all
smoke
,
and
no
blaze
;
vereas
smoke
ai
n't
o
'
no
use
at
all
in
making
a
boy
come
down
,
for
it
only
sinds
him
to
sleep
,
and
that
's
wot
<EOS>
he
likes
.
 
<EOS>
Boys

wery
lazy

Gen'l'men

and
<EOS>
there
's
nothink
like
a
good
hot

to
make
'em
come
down
vith
a

<EOS>
It
's
humane
too
,
gen'l'men
,
acause
,
even
if
they
've
stuck
in
the
chimbley
,
roasting
their
feet
makes
'em
struggle
to

theirselves
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
appeared
very
much
amused
by
this
explanation
;
but
his
mirth
was
speedily
checked
by
a
look
from
Mr
Limbkins
.
 
<EOS>
The
board
then
procedded
to
converse
among
themselves
for
a
few
minutes
,
but
in
so
low
a
tone
,
that
the
words
"
saving
of
expenditure
,
"
"
looked
well
in
the
accounts
,
"
"
have
a
printed
report
published
,
"
were
alone
audible
.
 
<EOS>
These
only
chanced
to
be
heard
,
indeed
,
or
account
of
their
being
very
frequently
repeated
with
great
emphasis
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
the
whispering
ceased
;
and
the
members
of
the
board
,
having
resumed
their
seats
and
their
solemnity
,
Mr
Limbkins
said
:
   
"
We
have
considered
your
proposition
,
and
we
do
n't
approve
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Decidedly
not
,
"
added
the
other
members
.
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Gamfield
did
happen
to
labour
under
the
slight
imputation
of
having
bruised
three
or
four
boys
to
death
already
,
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
board
had
,
perhaps
,
in
some
unaccountable
freak
,
taken
it
into
their
heads
that
this
extraneous
circumstance
ought
to
influence
their
proceedings
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
unlike
their
general
mode
of
doing
business
,
if
they
had
;
but
still
,
as
he
had
no
particular
wish
to
revive
the
rumour
,
he
twisted
his
cap
in
his
hands
,
and
walked
slowly
from
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
you
wo
n't
let
me
have
him
,
gen'l'men
?
"
said
Mr
Gamfield
,
pausing
near
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Mr
Limbkins
;
"
at
least
,
as
it
's
a
nasty
business
,
we
think
you
ought
to
take
something
less
than
the
premium
we
offered
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gamfield
's
countenance
brightened
,
as
,
with
a
quick
step
,
he
returned
to
the
table
,
and
said
,
   
"
What
'll
you
give
,
gen'l'men
?
 
<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
too
hard
on
a
poor
man
.
 
<EOS>
What
'll
you
give
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
,
three
pound
ten
was
plenty
,
"
said
Mr
Limbkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ten
shillings
too
much
,
"
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
<EOS>
said
Gamfield
;
"
say
four
pound
,
gen'l'men
.
 
<EOS>
Say
four
pound
,
and
you
've
got
rid
of
him
for
good
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
There
!
"
   
"
Three
pound
ten
,
"
repeated
Mr
Limbkins
,
firmly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
split
the
diff'erence
,
gen'l'men
,
urged
Gamfield
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Three
pound
fifteen
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
farthing
more
,
"
was
the
firm
reply
of
Mr
Limbkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
desperate
hard
upon
me
,
gen'l'men
,
said
Gamfield
,
wavering
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
 
<EOS>
pooh
!
 
<EOS>
nonsense
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
'd
be
cheap
with
nothing
at
all
,
as
a
premium
.
<EOS>
Take
him
,
you
silly
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
He
's
just
the
boy
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
wants
the
stick
,
now
<EOS>
and
then
:
 
it
'll
do
him
good
;
and
his
board
need
n't
come
very
expensive
,
for
he
has
n't
been
overfed
since
he
was
born
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
 
<EOS>
ha
!
 
<EOS>
ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gamfield
gave
an
arch
look
at
the
faces
round
the
table
,
and
,
observing
a
smile
on
all
of
them
,
gradually
broke
into
a
smile
himself
.
 
<EOS>
The
bargain
was
made
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
,
was
at
once
instructed
that
Oliver
Twist
and
his
indentures
were
to
be
conveyed
before
the
magistrate
,
for
signature
and
approval
,
that
very
afternoon
.
   
<EOS>
In
pursuance
of
this
determination
,
little
Oliver
,
to
his
excessive
astonishment
,
was
released
from
bondage
,
and
ordered
to
put
himself
into
a
clean
shirt
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
hardly
achieved
this
very
unusual
gymnastic
performance
,
when
Mr
Bumble
brought
him
,
with
his
own
hands
,
a
basin
of
gruel
,
and
the
holiday
allowance
of
two
ounces
and
a
quarter
of
bread
.
<EOS>
At
this
tremendous
sight
,
Oliver
began
to
cry
very
piteously
:
 
thinking
,
not
unnaturally
,
that
the
board
must
have
determined
to
kill
him
for
some
useful
purpose
,
or
they
never
would
have
begun
to
fatten
him
up
in
that
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
make
your
eyes
red
,
Oliver
,
but
eat
your
food
and
be
thankful
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
in
a
tone
of
impressive
pomposity
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
going
to
be
made
a
'
prentice
of
,
Oliver
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
prentice
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
child
,
trembling
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Oliver
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
kind
and
blessed
gentleman
which
is
so
amny
parents
to
you
,
Oliver
,
when
you
have
none
of
your
own
:
 
are
a
going
to
'
prentice
you
:
 
and
to
set
you
up
in
life
,
and
make
a
man
of
you
:
 
although
the
expense
to
the
parish
is
three
pound
ten
!
<EOS>
---
three
pound
ten
,
Oliver
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
seventy
shillins
---
one
hundred
and
forty
sixpences
!
<EOS>
---
and
all
for
a
naughty
orphan
which
noboday
ca
n't
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Bumble
paused
to
take
breath
,
after
delivering
this
address
in
an
awful
voice
,
the
tears
rolled
down
the
poor
child
's
face
,
and
he
sobbed
bitterly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
somewhat
less
pompously
,
for
it
was
gratifying
to
his
feelings
to
observe
the
effect
his
eloquence
had
produced
;
"
Come
,
Oliver
!
 
<EOS>
Wipe
your
eyes
with
the
cuffs
of
your
jacket
,
and
do
n't
cry
into
your
gruel
<EOS>
;
that
's
a
very
foolish
action
,
Oliver
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
certainly
was
,
for
there
was
quite
enough
water
in
it
already
.
   
<EOS>
On
their
way
to
the
magistrate
,
Mr
Bumble
instructed
Oliver
that
all
he
would
have
to
do
,
would
be
to
look
very
happy
,
and
say
,
when
the
gentleman
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
be
apprenticed
,
that
he
should
like
it
very
much
indeed
;
both
of
which
injunctions
Oliver
promised
to
obey
:
 
the
rather
as
Mr
Bumble
threw
in
a
gentle
hint
,
that
if
he
failed
in
either
particular
,
there
was
no
telling
what
would
be
done
to
him
.
<EOS>
When
they
arrived
at
the
office
,
he
was
shut
up
in
a
little
room
by
himself
,
and
admonished
by
Mr
Bumble
to
stay
there
,
until
he
came
back
to
fetch
him
.
   
<EOS>
There
the
boy
remained
,
with
a
palpitating
heart
,
for
half
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
expiration
of
which
time
Mr
Bumble
thrust
in
his
head
,
unadorned
with
the
cocked
hat
,
and
said
aloud
:
   
"
Now
,
Oliver
,
my
dear
,
come
to
the
gentleman
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
Mr
Bumble
said
this
,
he
put
on
a
grim
and
threatening
look
,
and
added
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
<EOS>
Mind
<EOS>
what
I
told
you
,
you
young
rascal
!
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
stared
innocently
in
Mr
Bumble
's
face
at
this
somewhat
contradictory
style
of
address
;
but
that
gentleman
prevented
his
offering
any
remark
thereupon
,
by
leading
him
at
once
into
an
adjoining
room
:
 
the
door
of
which
was
open
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
large
room
,
with
a
great
window
.
 
<EOS>
Behind
a
desk
,
sat
two
old
gentleman
with
powdered
heads
:
 
one
of
whom
was
reading
the
newspaper
;
while
the
other
was
perusing
,
with
the
aid
of
a
pair
of
tortoise
-
shell
spectacles
,
a
small
piece
of
parchment
which
lay
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Limbkins
was
standing
in
front
of
the
desk
on
one
side
;
and
Mr
Gamfield
,
with
a
partially
washed
face
,
on
the
other
;
while
two
or
three
bluff
-
looking
men
,
in
top
-
boots
,
were
lounging
about
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
with
the
spectacles
gradually
dozed
off
,
over
the
little
bit
of
parchment
;
and
there
was
a
short
pause
,
after
Oliver
had
been
stationed
by
Mr
Bumble
in
front
of
the
desk
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
boy
,
your
worship
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
who
was
reading
the
newspaper
raised
his
head
for
a
moment
,
and
pulled
the
other
old
gentleman
by
the
sleeve
;
whereupon
,
the
last
-
mentioned
old
gentleman
woke
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
is
this
the
boy
?
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
him
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bow
to
the
magistrate
,
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
roused
himself
,
and
made
his
best
obeisance
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
wondering
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
magistrates
'
powder
,
whether
all
boards
were
born
with
that
white
stuff
on
their
heads
,
and
were
boards
from
thenceforth
on
that
account
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
"
I
suppose
he
's
fond
of
chimney
-
sweeping
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
doats
on
it
,
your
worship
,
"
replied
Bumble
;
giving
Oliver
a
sly
pinch
,
to
intimate
that
he
had
better
not
say
he
did
n't
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
he
WILL
be
a
sweep
,
will
he
?
"
inquired
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
we
was
to
bind
him
to
any
other
trade
to
-
morrow
,
he
'd
run
away
simultaneous
,
your
worship
,
"
replied
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
this
man
that
's
to
be
his
master
---
you
,
sir
---
you
'll
treat
him
well
,
and
feed
him
,
and
do
all
that
sort
of
thing
,
will
you
?
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
says
I
will
,
I
means
I
will
,
"
replied
Mr
Gamfield
doggedly
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
rough
speaker
,
my
friend
,
but
you
look
an
honest
,
open
-
hearted
man
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
:
 
turning
his
spectacles
in
the
direction
of
the
candidate
for
Oliver
's
premium
,
<EOS>
whose
villainous
countenance
was
a
regular
stamped
receipt
for
cruelty
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
magistrate
was
half
blind
and
half
childish
,
so
he
could
n't
reasonably
be
expected
to
discern
what
other
people
did
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
am
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Gamfield
,
with
an
ugly
leer
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
you
are
,
my
friend
,
"
replied
the
old
gentleman
:
fixing
his
spectacles
more
firmly
on
his
nose
,
and
looking
about
him
for
the
inkstand
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
critical
moment
of
Oliver
's
fate
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
inkstand
had
been
where
the
old
gentleman
though
it
was
,
he
would
have
dipped
his
pen
into
it
,
and
signed
the
indentures
,
and
Oliver
would
have
been
straightway
hurried
off
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
it
chanced
to
be
immediately
under
his
nose
,
it
followed
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
that
he
looked
all
over
his
desk
for
it
,
without
finding
it
;
and
happening
in
the
course
of
his
search
to
look
straight
before
him
,
his
gaze
encountered
the
pale
and
terrified
face
of
Oliver
Twist
:
 
<EOS>
who
,
despite
all
the
admonitory
looks
and
pinches
of
Bumble
,
was
regarding
the
repulsive
countenance
of
his
future
master
,
with
a
mingled
expression
of
horror
and
fear
,
too
palpable
to
be
mistaken
,
even
by
a
half
-
blind
magistrate
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
stopped
,
laid
down
his
pen
,
and
looked
from
Oliver
to
Mr
Limbkins
;
who
attempted
to
take
snuff
with
a
cheerful
and
unconcerned
aspect
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
boy
!
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
"
you
look
pale
and
alarmed
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stand
a
little
away
from
him
,
Beadle
,
"
said
the
other
magistrate
:
 
laying
aside
the
paper
,
and
leaning
forward
with
an
expression
of
interest
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
boy
,
tell
us
what
's
the
matter
:
do
n't
be
afraid
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
fell
on
his
knees
,
and
clasping
his
hands
together
,
prayed
that
they
would
order
him
back
to
the
dark
room
---
 
that
they
would
starve
him

beat
him
---
kill
him
if
they
pleased
---
rather
than
send
him
away
with
that
dreadful
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
raising
his
hands
and
eyes
with
most
impressive
solemnite
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
!
of
all
the
artful
and
designing
orphans
that
ever
I
see
,
Oliver
,
you
are
one
of
the
most
bare
-
facedest
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
,
Beadle
,
"
said
the
second
old
gentleman
,
when
Mr
Bumble
had
given
vent
to
this
compound
adjective
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
worship
's
pardon
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
incredulous
of
having
heard
aright
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
your
worship
speak
to
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
Hold
your
tongue
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
was
stupefied
with
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
A
beadle
ordered
to
hold
his
tongue
!
 
<EOS>
A
moral
revolution
!
   
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
in
the
tortoise
-
shell
spectacles
looked
at
his
companion
,
he
nodded
significantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
refuse
to
sanction
these
indentures
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
:
   
tossing
aside
the
piece
of
parchment
as
he
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
stammered
Mr
Limbkins
:
 
"
I
hope
the
magistrates
will
not
form
the
opinion
that
the
authorities
have
been
guilty
of
any
improper
conduct
,
on
the
unsupported
testimony
of
a
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
magistrates
are
not
called
upon
to
pronounce
any
opinion
on
the
matter
,
"
said
the
second
old
gentleman
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
the
boy
back
to
the
workhouse
,
and
treat
him
kindly
.
 
<EOS>
He
seems
to
want
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
That
same
evening
,
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
most
positively
and
decidedly
affirmed
,
not
only
that
Oliver
would
be
hung
,
but
that
he
would
be
drawn
and
quartered
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
shook
his
head
with
gloomy
mystery
,
and
said
he
wished
he
might
come
to
good
;
whereunto
Mr
Gamfield
replied
,
that
he
wished
he
might
come
to
him
;
which
,
although
he
agreed
with
the
beadle
in
most
matters
,
would
seem
to
be
a
wish
of
a
totally
opposite
description
.
   
<EOS>
The
next
morning
,
the
public
were
once
informed
that
Oliver
Twist
was
again
To
Let
,
and
that
five
pounds
would
be
paid
to
anybody
who
would
take
possession
of
him
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
4
.
<EOS>
Oliver
,
being
offered
another
place
,
makes
his
first
entry
into
public
life
.
 
<EOS>
In
great
families
,
when
an
advantageous
place
can
not
be
obtained
,
either
in
possession
,
reversion
,
remainder
,
or
expectancy
,
for
the
young
man
who
is
growing
up
,
it
is
a
very
general
custom
to
send
him
to
sea
.
 
<EOS>
The
board
,
in
imitation
of
so
wise
and
salutary
an
example
,
took
counsel
together
on
the
expediency
of
shipping
off
Oliver
Twist
,
in
some
small
trading
vessel
bound
to
a
good
unhealthy
port
.
 
<EOS>
This
suggested
itself
as
the
very
best
thing
that
could
possibly
be
done
with
him
:
the
probability
being
,
that
the
skipper
would
flog
him
to
death
,
in
a
playful
mood
,
some
day
after
dinner
,
or
would
knock
his
brains
out
with
an
iron
bar
;
both
pastimes
being
,
as
is
pretty
generally
known
,
very
favourite
and
common
recreations
among
gentleman
of
that
class
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
the
case
presented
itself
to
the
board
,
in
this
point
of
view
,
the
more
manifold
the
advantages
of
the
step
appeared
;
so
,
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
way
of
providing
for
Oliver
effectually
,
was
to
send
him
to
sea
without
delay
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
had
been
despatched
to
make
various
preliminary
inquiries
,
with
the
view
of
finding
out
some
captain
or
other
who
wanted
a
cabin
-
boy
without
any
friends
;
and
was
returning
to
the
workhouse
to
communicate
the
result
of
his
mission
;
when
he
encountered
at
the
gate
,
no
less
a
person
than
Mr
Sowerberry
,
the
parochial
undertaker
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sowerberry
was
a
tall
gaunt
,
large
-
jointed
man
,
attired
in
a
suit
of
threadbare
black
,
with
darned
cotton
stockings
of
the
same
colour
,
and
shoes
to
answer
.
 
<EOS>
His
features
were
not
naturally
intended
to
wear
a
smiling
aspect
,
but
he
was
in
general
rather
given
to
professional
jocosity
.
 
<EOS>
His
step
was
elastic
,
and
his
face
betokened
inward
pleasantry
,
as
he
advanced
to
Mr
Bumble
,
and
shook
him
cordially
by
the
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
taken
the
measure
of
the
two
women
that
died
last
night
,
Mr
Bumble
,
"
said
the
undertaker
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
make
your
fortune
,
Mr
Sowerberry
,
"
said
the
beadle
,
as
he
thrust
his
thumb
and
forefinger
into
the
proferred
snuff
-
box
of
the
undertaker
:
 
which
was
an
ingenious
little
model
of
a
patent
coffin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
you
'll
make
your
fortune
,
Mr
Sowerberry
,
"
repeated
Mr
Bumble
,
tapping
the
undertaker
on
the
shoulder
,
in
a
friendly
manner
,
with
his
cane
.
   
<EOS>
"
Think
so
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
undertaker
in
a
tone
which
half
admitted
and
half
disputed
the
probability
of
the
event
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
prices
allowed
by
the
board
are
very
small
,
Mr
Bumble
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
are
the
coffins
,
"
replied
the
beadle
:
 
with
precisely
as
near
an
approach
to
a
laugh
as
a
great
official
ought
to
indulge
in
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sowerberry
was
much
tickled
at
this
:
 
as
of
course
he
ought
to
be
;
and
laughed
a
long
time
without
cessation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
Mr
Bumble
,
"
he
said
at
length
,
"
there
's
no
denying
that
,
since
the
new
system
of
feeding
has
come
in
,
the
coffins
are
something
narrower
and
more
shallow
than
they
used
to
be
;
but
we
must
have
some
profit
,
Mr
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
Well
-
seasoned
timber
is
an
expensive
article
,
sir
;
and
all
the
iron
handles
come
,
by
canal
,
from
Birmingham
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
"
<EOS>
every
trade
has
its
drawbacks
.
<EOS>
A
fair
profit
is
,
of
course
,
allowable
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
of
course
,
"
replied
the
undertaker
;
"
and
if
I
do
n't
get
a
profit
upon
this
or
that
particular
article
,
why
,
I
make
it
up
in
the
long
-
run
,
you
see
---
he
!
<EOS>
he
!
<EOS>
he
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
so
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
Though
I
must
say
,
"
continued
the
undertaker
,
resuming
the
current
of
observations
which
the
beadle
had
interrupted
:
"
though
I
must
say
,
Mr
Bumble
,
that
I
have
to
contend
against
one
very
great
disadvantage
:
 
which
is
,
that
all
the
stout
people
go
off
the
quickest
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
who
have
been
better
off
,
and
have
paid
rates
for
many
years
,
are
the
first
to
sink
when
they
come
into
the
house
;
and
let
me
tell
you
,
Mr
Bumble
,
that
three
or
four
inches
over
one
's
calculation
makes
a
great
hole
in
one
's
profits
:
especially
when
one
has
a
family
to
provide
for
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Sowerberry
said
this
,
with
the
becoming
indignation
of
an
ill
-
used
man
;
and
as
Mr
Bumble
felt
that
it
rather
tended
to
convey
a
reflection
on
the
honour
of
the
parish
;
the
latter
gentleman
thought
it
advisable
to
change
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
Twist
being
uppermost
in
his
mind
,
he
made
him
his
theme
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
the
bye
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
"
you
do
n't
know
anybody
who
wants
a
boy
,
do
you
?
 
<EOS>
A
porochial
'
prentis
,
who
is
at
present
a
dead
-
weight
;
a
millstone
,
as
I
may
say
,
round
the
porochial
throat
?
 
<EOS>
Liberal
terms
,
Mr
Sowerberry
,
liberal
terms
?
"
 
<EOS>
As
Mr
Bumble
spoke
,
he
raised
his
cane
to
the
bill
above
him
,
and
gave
three
distinct
raps
upon
the
words
"
five
pounds
"
:
 
which
were
printed
thereon
in
Roman
capitals
of
gigantic
size
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gadso
!
"
said
the
undertaker
:
 
taking
Mr
Bumble
by
the
gilt
-
edged
lappel
of
his
official
coat
;
"
that
's
just
the
very
thing
I
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
---
<EOS>
dear
me
,
what
a
very
elegant
button
this
is
,
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
noticed
it
before
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
think
it
rather
pretty
,
"
said
the
beadle
,
glancing
proudly
downwards
at
the
large
brass
buttons
which
embellished
his
coat
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
die
is
the
same
as
the
porochial
seal
---
<EOS>
the
Good
Samaritan
healing
the
sick
and
bruised
man
.
<EOS>
The
board
presented
it
to
me
on
Newyear
's
morning
,
Mr
Sowerberry
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
it
on
<EOS>
,
I
remember
,
for
the
first
time
,
to
attend
the
inquest
on
that
reduced
tradesman
,
who
died
in
a
doorway
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
recollect
,
"
said
the
undertaker
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
jury
brought
it
in
,
"
Died
from
exposure
to
the
cold
,
and
want
of
the
common
necessaries
of
life
,
"
did
n't
they
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
nodded
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
they
made
it
a
special
verdict
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
"
said
the
undertaker
,
"
by
adding
some
words
to
the
effect
,
<EOS>
that
if
the
relieving
officer
had
---
"
   
"
Tush
!
 
Foolery
!
"
interposed
the
beadle
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
the
board
attended
to
all
the
nonsense
that
ignorant
jurymen
talk
,
they
'd
have
enough
to
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
"
said
the
undertaker
;
"
they
would
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Juries
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
grasping
his
cane
tightly
,
as
was
his
wo
nt
when
working
into
a
passion
:
 
<EOS>
"
juries
is
ineddicated
,
vulgar
,
grovelling
wretches
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
they
are
,
"
said
the
undertaker
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
have
n't
no
more
philosophy
nor
political
economy
about
'em
than
that
,
"
said
the
beadle
,
snapping
his
fingers
contemptuously
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
more
they
have
,
"
acquiesced
the
undertaker
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
despise
'
em
,
"
said
the
beadle
,
growing
very
red
in
the
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
do
I
,
"
rejoined
the
undertaker
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
only
wish
we
'd
a
jury
of
the
independent
sort
,
in
the
house
for
a
week
or
two
,
"
said
the
beadle
;
"
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
board
would
soon
bring
their
spirit
down
for
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
'em
alone
for
that
,
"
replied
the
undertaker
.
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
smiled
,
approvingly
:
 
to
calm
the
rising
wrath
of
the
indignant
parish
officer
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
lifted
off
his
cocked
hat
;
took
a
handkerchief
from
the
inside
of
the
crown
;
wiped
from
his
forehead
the
perspiration
which
his
rage
had
engendered
;
fixed
the
cocked
hat
on
again
;
and
,
turning
to
the
undertaker
,
said
in
a
calmer
voice
:
   
"
<EOS>
Well
;
what
about
the
boy
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
replied
the
undertaker
;
why
,
you
know
,
Mr
Bumble
,
I
pay
a
good
deal
towards
the
poor
's
rates
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
"
said
Mr
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
replied
the
undertaker
,
"
I
was
thinking
that
if
I
pay
so
much
towards
'em
,
I
've
a
right
to
get
as
much
out
of
'em
as
I
can
,
Mr
Bumble
;
and
so
<EOS>
---
I
think
I
'll
take
the
boy
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
grasped
the
undertaker
by
the
arm
,
and
led
him
into
the
building
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sowerberry
was
closeted
with
the
board
for
five
minutes
;
and
it
was
arranged
that
Oliver
should
go
to
him
that
evening
"
upon
liking
"
---
a
phrase
which
means
,
in
the
case
of
a
parish
apprentice
,
that
if
the
master
find
,
upon
a
short
trial
,
that
he
can
get
enough
work
out
of
a
boy
without
putting
too
much
food
into
him
,
he
shall
have
him
for
a
term
of
years
,
to
do
what
he
likes
with
.
   
<EOS>
When
little
Oliver
was
taken
before
"
the
gentlemen
"
that
evening
;
and
informed
that
he
was
to
go
,
that
night
,
as
general
house
-
lad
to
a
coffin
-
maker
's
;
and
that
if
he
complained
of
his
situation
,
or
ever
came
back
to
the
parish
again
,
he
would
be
sent
to
sea
,
there
to
be
drowned
,
or
knocked
on
the
head
,
as
the
case
might
be
,
he
evinced
so
little
emotion
,
that
they
by
common
consent
pronounced
him
a
hardened
young
rascal
,
and
orered
Mr
Bumble
to
remove
him
forthwith
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
although
it
was
very
natural
that
the
board
,
of
all
people
in
the
world
,
should
feel
in
a
great
state
of
virtuous
astonishment
and
horror
at
the
smallest
tokens
of
want
of
feeling
on
the
part
of
anybody
,
they
were
rather
out
,
in
this
particular
instance
.
 
<EOS>
The
simple
fact
was
,
that
Oliver
,
instead
of
possessing
too
little
feeling
,
possessed
rather
too
much
;
and
was
in
a
fair
way
of
being
reduced
,
for
life
,
to
a
state
of
brutal
stupidity
and
sullenness
by
the
ill
usage
he
had
received
.
 
<EOS>
He
heard
the
news
of
his
destination
,
in
perfect
silence
;
and
,
having
had
his
luggage
put
into
his
hand
---
which
was
not
very
difficult
to
carry
,
inasmuch
as
it
was
all
comprised
within
the
limits
of
a
brown
paper
parcel
,
about
half
a
foot
square
by
three
inches
deep
---
he
pulled
his
cap
over
his
eyes
;
and
once
more
attaching
himself
to
Mr
Bumble
's
coat
cuff
,
was
led
away
by
that
dignitary
to
a
new
scene
of
suffering
.
   
<EOS>
For
some
time
,
Mr
Bumble
drew
Oliver
along
,
without
notice
or
remark
;
for
the
beadle
carried
his
head
very
erect
,
as
a
beadle
always
should
:
 
and
,
it
being
a
windy
day
,
little
Oliver
was
completely
enshrouded
by
the
skirts
of
Mr
Bumble
's
coat
as
they
blew
open
,
and
disclosed
to
great
advantage
his
flapped
waistcoat
and
drab
plush
knee
-
breeches
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
drew
near
to
their
destination
,
however
,
Mr
Bumble
thought
it
expedient
to
look
down
,
and
see
that
the
boy
was
in
good
order
for
inspection
by
his
new
master
:
 
which
he
accordingly
did
,
with
a
fit
and
becoming
air
of
gracious
patronage
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oliver
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
Mr
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
,
in
a
low
,
tremulous
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pull
that
cap
off
your
eyes
,
and
hold
up
your
head
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Although
Oliver
did
as
he
was
desired
,
at
once
;
and
passed
the
back
of
his
unoccupied
hand
briskly
across
his
eyes
,
he
left
a
tear
in
them
when
he
looked
up
at
his
conductor
.
 
<EOS>
As
Mr
Bumble
gazed
sternly
upon
him
,
it
rolled
down
his
cheek
.
<EOS>
It
was
followed
by
another
,
and
another
.
 
<EOS>
The
child
made
a
strong
effort
,
but
it
was
an
unsuccessful
one
.
 
<EOS>
Withdrawing
his
other
hand
from
Mr
Bumble
's
he
covered
his
face
with
both
;
and
wept
until
the
tears
sprung
out
from
between
his
chin
and
bony
fingers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Bumble
,
stopping
short
,
and
darting
at
his
little
charge
a
look
of
intense
malignity
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
Of
ALL
the
ungratefullest
,
and
worst
-
disposed
boys
as
ever
<EOS>
I
see
,
Oliver
,
you
are
the
---
"
   
"
No
,
no
,
sir
,
"
sobbed
Oliver
,
<EOS>
clinging
to
the
hand
which
held
the
well
-
known
cane
;
"
no
,
no
,
sir
;
I
will
be
good
indeed
;
indeed
,
indeed
I
will
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
very
little
boy
,
sir
;
and
it
is
so
---
<EOS>
so
---
"
   
"
So
what
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Bumble
in
amazement
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
lonely
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
So
very
lonely
!
"
cried
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
"
Everybody
hates
me
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
sir
,
do
n't
,
do
n't
pray
be
cross
to
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
child
beat
his
hand
upon
his
heart
;
and
looked
in
his
companion
's
face
,
with
tears
of
real
agony
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
regarded
Oliver
's
piteous
and
helpless
look
,
with
some
astonishment
,
for
a
few
seconds
;
hemmed
three
or
four
times
in
a
husky
manner
;
and
after
muttering
something
about
"
that
troublesome
cough
,
"
bade
Oliver
dry
his
eyes
and
be
a
good
boy
.
<EOS>
Then
once
more
taking
his
hand
,
he
walked
on
with
him
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
The
undertaker
,
who
had
just
putup
the
shutters
of
his
shop
,
was
making
some
entries
in
his
day
-
book
by
the
light
of
a
most
appropriate
dismal
candle
,
when
Mr
Bumble
entered
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
said
the
undertaker
;
looking
up
from
the
book
,
and
pausing
in
the
middle
of
a
word
;
"
is
that
you
,
Bumble
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
one
else
,
Mr
Sowerberry
,
"
replied
the
beadle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
!
I
've
brought
the
boy
.
"
 
<EOS>
Oliver
made
a
bow
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
's
the
boy
,
is
it
?
"
said
the
undertaker
:
 
raising
the
candle
above
his
head
,
to
get
a
better
view
of
Oliver
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Sowerberry
,
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
come
here
a
moment
,
my
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Sowerberry
emerged
from
a
little
room
behind
the
shop
,
and
presented
the
form
of
a
short
,
then
,
squeezed
-
up
woman
,
with
a
vixenish
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Sowerberry
,
deferentially
,
"
this
is
the
boy
from
the
workhouse
that
I
told
you
of
.
"
 
<EOS>
Oliver
bowed
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
said
the
undertaker
's
wife
,
"
he
's
very
small
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
he
IS
rather
small
,
"
replied
Mr
Bumble
:
 
looking
at
Oliver
as
if
it
were
his
fault
that
he
was
no
bigger
;
"
he
is
small
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
denying
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
'll
grow
,
Mrs
Sowerberry
---
he
'll
grow
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
will
,
"
replied
the
lady
pettishly
,
"
on
our
victuals
and
our
drink
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
no
saving
in
parish
children
,
not
I
;
for
they
always
cost
more
to
keep
,
than
they
're
worth
.
<EOS>
However
,
men
always
think
they
know
best
.
<EOS>
There
!
 
<EOS>
Get
downstairs
,
little
bag
o
'
bones
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
the
undertaker
's
wife
opened
a
side
door
,
and
pushed
Oliver
down
a
steep
flight
of
stairs
into
a
stone
cell
,
damp
and
dark
:
 
forming
the
ante
-
room
to
the
coal
-
cellar
,
and
denominated
"
kitchen
"
;
wherein
sat
a
slatternly
girl
,
in
shoes
down
at
heel
,
and
blue
worsted
stockings
very
much
out
of
repair
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
,
Charlotte
,
"
said
Mr
Sowerberry
,
who
had
followed
Oliver
down
,
"
give
this
boy
some
of
the
cold
bits
that
were
put
by
for
Trip
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
n't
come
home
since
the
morning
,
so
he
may
go
without
'em
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
the
boy
is
n't
too
dainty
to
eat
'em
---
are
you
,
boy
?
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
,
whose
eyes
had
glistened
at
the
mention
of
meat
,
and
who
was
trembling
with
eagerness
to
devour
it
,
replied
in
the
negative
;
and
a
plateful
of
coarse
broken
victuals
was
set
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
I
wish
some
well
-
fed
philosopher
,
whose
meat
and
drink
turn
to
gall
within
him
;
whose
blood
is
ice
,
whose
heart
is
iron
;
could
have
seen
Oliver
Twist
clutching
at
the
dainty
viands
that
the
dog
had
neglected
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
he
could
have
witnessed
the
horrible
avidity
with
which
Oliver
tore
the
bits
asunder
with
all
the
ferocity
of
famine
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
only
one
thing
I
should
like
better
;
and
that
would
be
to
see
the
Philosopher
making
the
same
sort
of
meal
himself
,
with
the
same
relish
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
the
undertaker
's
wife
,
when
Oliver
had
finished
his
supper
:
 
which
she
had
regarded
in
silent
horror
,
and
with
fearful
auguries
of
his
future
appetite
:
 
"
have
you
done
?
"
   
<EOS>
There
being
nothing
eatable
within
his
reach
,
Oliver
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
come
with
me
,
"
said
Mrs
Sowerberry
:
 
taking
up
a
dim
and
dirty
lamp
,
and
leading
the
way
upstairs
;
"
your
bed
's
under
the
counter
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
mind
sleeping
among
the
coffins
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
But
it
does
n't
much
matter
whether
you
do
or
do
n't
,
for
you
ca
n't
sleep
anywhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
Come
;
do
n't
keep
me
here
all
night
!
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
lingered
no
longer
,
but
meekly
followed
his
new
mistress
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
5
.
<EOS>
Oliver
mingles
with
new
associates
.
 
<EOS>
Going
to
a
funeral
for
the
First
time
,
he
forms
an
unfavourable
notion
of
his
master
's
Business
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
,
being
left
to
himself
in
the
undertaker
's
shop
,
set
the
lamp
down
on
a
workman
's
bench
,
and
gazed
timidly
about
him
with
a
feeling
of
awe
and
dread
,
which
many
people
a
good
deal
older
than
he
will
be
at
no
loss
to
understand
.
 
<EOS>
An
unfinished
coffin
on
black
tressels
,
which
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
shop
,
looked
so
gloomy
and
death
-
like
that
a
cold
tremble
came
over
him
,
every
time
his
eyes
wandered
in
the
direction
of
the
dismal
object
:
from
which
he
almost
expected
to
see
some
frightful
form
slowly
rear
its
head
,
to
drive
him
mad
with
terror
.
 
<EOS>
Against
the
wall
were
ranged
,
in
regular
array
,
a
long
row
of
elm
boards
cut
in
the
same
shape
:
looking
in
the
dim
light
,
like
high
-
shouldered
ghosts
with
their
hands
in
their
breeches
pockets
.
<EOS>
Coffin
-
plates
,
elm
-
chips
,
bright
-
headed
nails
,
and
shreds
of
black
cloth
,
lay
scattered
on
the
floor
;
and
the
wall
behind
the
counter
was
ornamented
with
a
lively
representation
of
two
mutes
in
very
stiff
neckcloths
,
on
duty
at
a
large
private
door
,
with
a
hearse
drawn
by
four
black
steeds
,
approaching
in
the
distance
.
<EOS>
The
shop
was
close
and
hot
.
 
<EOS>
The
atmosphere
seemed
tainted
with
the
smell
of
coffins
.
 
<EOS>
The
recess
beneath
the
counter
in
which
his
flock
mattress
was
thrust
,
looked
like
a
grave
.
   
<EOS>
Nor
were
these
the
only
dismal
feelings
which
depressed
Oliver
.
<EOS>
He
was
alone
in
a
strange
place
;
and
we
all
know
how
chilled
and
desolate
the
best
of
us
will
sometimes
feel
in
such
a
situation
.
<EOS>
The
boy
had
no
friends
to
care
for
,
or
to
care
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
regret
of
no
recent
separation
was
fresh
in
his
mind
;
the
absence
of
no
loved
and
well
-
remembered
face
sank
heavily
into
his
heart
.
   
<EOS>
But
his
heart
was
heavy
,
notwithstanding
;
and
he
wished
,
as
he
crept
into
his
narrow
bed
,
that
that
were
his
coffin
,
and
that
he
could
be
lain
in
a
calm
and
lasting
sleep
in
the
churchyard
ground
,
with
the
tall
grass
waving
gently
above
his
head
,
and
the
sound
of
the
old
deep
bell
to
soothe
him
in
his
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
was
awakened
in
the
morning
,
by
a
loud
kicking
at
the
outside
of
the
shop
-
door
:
 
which
,
before
he
could
huddle
on
his
clothes
,
was
repeated
,
in
an
angry
and
impetuous
manner
,
about
twenty
-
five
times
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
began
to
undo
the
chain
,
the
legs
desisted
,
and
a
voice
began
.
   
<EOS>
"
Open
the
door
,
will
yer
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
voice
which
belonged
to
the
legs
which
had
kicked
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
directly
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
:
 
undoing
the
chain
,
and
turning
the
key
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
yer
the
new
boy
,
ai
n't
yer
?
"
said
the
voice
through
the
key
-
hole
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
old
are
yer
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ten
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
whop
yer
when
I
get
in
,
"
said
the
voice
;
"
you
just
see
if
I
do
n't
,
that
's
all
,
my
<EOS>
work'us
brat
!
"
<EOS>
and
having
made
this
obliging
promise
,
the
voice
began
to
whistle
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
had
been
too
often
subjected
to
the
process
to
which
the
very
expressive
monosyllable
just
recorded
bears
reference
,
to
entertain
the
smallest
doubt
that
the
owner
of
the
voice
,
whoever
he
might
be
,
would
redeem
his
pledge
,
most
honourably
.
<EOS>
He
drew
back
the
bolts
with
a
trembling
hand
,
and
opened
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
For
a
second
or
two
,
Oliver
glanced
up
the
street
,
and
down
the
street
,
and
over
the
way
:
 
impressed
with
the
belief
that
the
unknown
,
who
had
addressed
him
through
the
key
-
hole
,
had
walked
a
few
paces
off
,
to
warm
himself
;
for
nobody
did
he
see
but
<EOS>
a
big
charity
-
boy
,
sitting
on
a
post
in
front
of
the
house
,
eating
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
:
 
which
he
cut
into
wedges
,
the
size
of
his
mouth
,
with
a
clasp
-
knife
,
and
then
consumed
with
great
dexterity
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
said
Oliver
at
length
:
 
<EOS>
seeing
that
no
other
visitor
made
his
appearance
;
"
did
you
knock
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
kicked
,
"
replied
the
charity
-
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
want
a
coffin
,
sir
?
"
inquired
Oliver
,
innocently
.
   
<EOS>
At
this
,
the
charity
-
boy
looked
monstrous
fierce
;
and
said
that
Oliver
would
want
one
before
long
,
if
he
cut
jokes
with
his
superiors
in
that
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yer
do
n't
know
who
I
am
,
I
suppose
,
Work'us
?
"
said
the
charity
-
boy
,
in
continuation
:
 
descending
from
the
top
of
the
post
,
meanwhile
,
with
edifying
gravity
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
Mister
Noah
Claypole
,
"
said
the
charity
-
boy
,
"
and
you
're
under
me
.
 
<EOS>
Take
down
the
shutters
,
yer
idle
young
ruffian
!
"
<EOS>
With
this
,
Mr
Claypole
administered
a
kick
to
Oliver
,
and
entered
the
shop
with
a
dignified
air
,
which
did
him
great
credit
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
difficult
for
a
large
-
headed
,
small
-
eyed
youth
,
of
lumbering
make
and
heavy
countenance
,
to
look
dignified
under
any
circumstances
;
but
it
is
more
especially
so
,
when
superadded
to
these
personal
attractions
are
a
red
nose
and
yellow
smalls
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
,
having
taken
down
the
shutters
,
and
broken
a
pane
of
glass
in
his
effort
to
stagger
away
beneath
the
weight
of
the
first
one
to
a
small
court
at
the
side
of
the
house
in
which
they
were
kept
during
the
day
,
was
graciously
assisted
by
Noah
:
 
who
having
consoled
him
with
the
assurance
that
"
he
'd
catch
it
,
"
condescended
to
help
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sowerberry
came
down
soon
after
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
Mrs
Sowerberry
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
having
"
caught
it
,
"
in
fulfilment
of
Noah
's
prediction
,
followed
that
young
gentleman
down
the
stairs
to
breakfast
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
near
the
fire
,
Noah
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
saved
a
nice
little
bit
of
bacon
for
you
from
master
's
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
,
shut
that
door
at
Mister
Noah
's
back
,
and
take
them
bits
that
I
've
put
out
on
the
cover
of
the
bread
-
pan
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
your
tea
;
take
it
away
to
that
box
,
and
drink
it
there
,
and
make
haste
,
for
they
'll
want
you
to
mind
the
shop
.
 
<EOS>
D'ye
hear
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
D'ye
hear
,
Work'us
?
"
said
Noah
Claypole
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
,
Noah
!
"
said
Charlotte
,
"
what
a
rum
creature
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
let
the
boy
alone
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
him
alone
!
"
said
Noah
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
everybody
lets
him
alone
enough
,
for
the
matter
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
his
father
nor
his
mother
will
ever
interfere
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
All
his
relations
let
him
have
his
own
way
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
,
Charlotte
?
 
<EOS>
He
!
<EOS>
he
!
<EOS>
he
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
queer
soul
!
"
said
Charlotte
,
bursting
into
a
hearty
laugh
,
in
which
she
was
joined
by
Noah
;
after
which
they
both
looked
scornfully
at
poor
Oliver
Twist
,
as
he
sat
shivering
on
the
box
in
the
coldest
corner
of
the
room
,
and
ate
the
stale
pieces
which
had
been
specially
reserved
for
him
.
   
<EOS>
Noah
was
a
charity
-
boy
,
but
not
a
workhouse
orphan
.
 
<EOS>
No
chance
-
child
was
he
,
for
he
could
trace
his
genealogy
all
the
way
back
to
his
parents
,
who
lived
hard
by
;
his
mother
being
a
washerwoman
,
and
his
father
a
drunken
soldier
,
discharged
with
a
wooden
leg
,
and
a
diurnal
pension
of
twopence
-
halfpenny
and
an
unstateable
fraction
.
 
<EOS>
The
shop
-
boys
in
the
neighbourhood
had
long
been
in
the
habit
of
branding
Noah
in
the
public
streets
,
with
the
ignominious
epithets
of
"
leathers
,
"
"
charity
,
"
and
the
like
;
and
Noah
<EOS>
had
bourne
them
without
reply
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
now
that
fortune
had
cast
in
his
way
<EOS>
a
nameless
orphan
,
at
whom
even
the
meanest
could
point
the
finger
of
scorn
,
he
retorted
on
him
with
interest
.
 
<EOS>
This
affords
charming
food
for
contemplation
.
 
<EOS>
It
shows
us
what
a
beautiful
thing
human
nature
may
be
made
to
be
;
and
how
impartially
the
same
amiable
qualities
are
developed
in
the
finest
lord
and
the
dirtiest
charity
-
boy
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
had
been
sojourning
at
the
undertaker
's
some
three
weeks
or
a
month
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Sowerberry
---
the
shop
being
shut
up
---
were
taking
their
supper
in
the
little
back
-
parlour
,
when
Mr
Sowerberry
,
after
several
deferential
glances
at
his
wife
,
said
,
   
"
<EOS>
My
dear
---
"
 
He
was
going
to
say
more
;
but
,
Mrs
Sowerberry
looking
up
,
with
a
peculiarly
unpropitious
aspect
,
he
stopped
short
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
Mrs
Sowerberry
,
sharply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
my
dear
,
nothing
,
"
said
Mr
Sowerberry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ugh
,
you
brute
!
"
said
Mrs
Sowerberry
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
at
all
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Sowerberry
humbly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
did
n't
want
to
hear
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
only
going
to
say
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
tell
me
what
you
were
going
to
say
,
"
interposed
Mrs
Sowerberry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
nobody
;
do
n't
consult
me
,
pray
.
 
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
I
\
do
n't
want
to
intrude
upon
your
secrets
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
Mrs
Sowerberry
said
this
,
she
gave
an
hysterical
laugh
,
which
threatened
violent
consequences
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Sowerberry
,
"
I
want
to
ask
your
advice
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
do
n't
ask
mine
,
"
replied
Mrs
Sowerberry
,
in
an
affecting
manner
:
 
"
ask
somebody
else
's
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Here
,
there
was
another
hysterical
laugh
,
which
frightened
Mr
Sowerberry
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
very
common
and
much
-
approved
matrimonial
course
of
treatment
,
which
is
often
very
effective
<EOS>
It
at
once
reduced
Mr
Sowerberry
to
begging
,
as
a
special
favour
,
to
be
allowed
to
say
what
Mrs
Sowerberry
was
most
curious
to
hear
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
short
duration
,
the
permission
was
most
graciously
conceded
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
only
about
young
Twist
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Sowerberry
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
very
good
-
looking
boy
,
that
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
need
be
,
for
he
eats
enough
,
"
observed
the
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
an
expression
of
melancholy
in
his
face
,
my
dear
,
"
resumed
Mr
Sowerberry
,
"
which
is
very
interesting
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
make
a
delightful
mute
,
my
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Sowerberry
looked
up
with
an
expression
of
considerable
wonderment
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sowerberry
remarked
it
and
,
without
allowing
time
for
any
observation
on
the
good
lady
's
part
,
proceeded
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
a
regular
mute
to
attend
grown
-
up
people
,
my
dear
,
but
only
for
children
's
practice
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
very
new
to
have
a
mute
in
proportion
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
depend
upon
it
,
it
would
have
a
superb
effect
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Sowerberry
,
who
had
a
good
deal
of
taste
in
the
undertaking
way
,
was
much
struck
by
the
novelty
of
this
idea
;
but
,
as
it
would
have
been
compromising
her
dignity
to
have
said
so
,
under
existing
circumstances
,
she
merely
inquired
,
with
much
sharpness
,
why
such
an
obvious
suggestion
had
not
presented
itself
to
her
husband
's
mind
before
?
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sowerberry
rightly
construed
this
,
as
an
acquiescence
in
his
proposition
;
it
was
speedily
determined
,
therefore
,
that
Oliver
should
be
at
once
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
the
trade
;
and
,
with
this
view
,
that
he
should
accompany
his
master
on
the
very
next
occasion
of
his
services
being
required
.
   
<EOS>
The
occasion
was
not
long
in
coming
.
 
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
after
breakfast
next
morning
,
Mr
Bumble
entered
the
shop
;
and
supporting
his
cane
against
the
counter
,
drew
forth
his
large
leathern
pocket
-
book
:
 
from
which
he
selected
a
small
scrap
of
paper
,
which
he
handed
over
to
Sowerberry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
said
the
undertaker
,
glancing
over
it
with
a
lively
countenance
;
"
an
order
for
a
coffin
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
a
coffin
first
,
and
a
porochial
funeral
afterwards
,
"
replied
Mr
Bumble
,
fastening
the
strap
of
the
leathern
pocket
-
book
:
which
,
like
himself
,
was
very
corpulent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bayton
,
"
said
the
undertaker
,
looking
from
the
scrap
of
paper
to
Mr
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
the
name
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
Bumble
shook
his
head
,
as
he
replied
,
"
Obstinate
people
,
Mr
Sowerberry
;
very
obstinate
.
 
<EOS>
Proud
,
too
,
I
'm
afraid
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Proud
,
eh
?
"
exclaimed
Mr
Sowerberry
with
a
sneer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
that
's
too
much
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
sickening
,
"
replied
the
beadle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Antimonial
,
Mr
Sowerberry
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
it
is
,
"
asquiesced
the
undertaker
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
only
heard
of
the
family
the
night
before
last
,
"
said
the
beadle
;
"
and
we
should
n't
have
known
anything
about
them
,
then
,
only
a
woman
who
lodges
in
the
same
house
made
an
application
to
the
porochial
committee
for
them
to
send
the
porochial
surgeon
to
see
a
woman
as
was
very
bad
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
gone
out
to
dinner
;
but
his
'
prentice
(
which
is
a
very
clever
lad
)
sent
'em
some
medicine
in
a
blacking
-
bottle
,
offhand
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
there
's
promptness
,
"
said
the
undertaker
.
   
<EOS>
"
Promptness
,
indeed
!
"
replied
the
beadle
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
what
's
the
consequence
;
what
's
the
ungrateful
behaviour
of
these
rebels
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
the
husband
sends
back
word
that
the
medicine
wo
n't
suit
his
wife
's
complaint
,
and
so
she
sha
n't
take
it
<EOS>
---
says
she
sha
n't
take
it
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
Good
,
strong
,
wholesome
medicine
,
as
was
given
with
great
success
to
two
Irish
labourers
and
a
coal
-
heaver
,
ony
a
week
before
---
sent
'em
for
nothing
,
with
a
blackin'-bottle
in
,
---
and
he
sends
back
word
that
she
sha
n't
take
it
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
atrocity
presented
itself
to
Mr
Bumble
's
mind
in
full
force
,
he
struck
the
counter
sharply
with
his
cane
,
and
became
flushed
with
indignation
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
the
undertaker
,
"
<EOS>
I
ne
---
<EOS>
ver
---
did
---
"
   
"
Never
did
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
beadle
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
nor
nobody
never
did
;
but
now
she
's
dead
,
we
've
got
to
bury
her
;
and
that
's
the
direction
;
and
the
sooner
it
's
done
,
the
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
saying
,
Mr
Bumble
put
on
his
cocked
hat
wrong
side
first
,
in
a
fever
of
parochial
excietment
;
and
flounced
out
of
the
shop
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
he
was
so
angry
,
Oliver
,
that
he
forgot
even
to
ask
after
you
!
"
said
Mr
Sowerberry
,
looking
after
the
beadle
as
he
strode
down
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
,
who
had
carefully
kept
himself
out
of
sight
,
during
the
interview
;
and
who
was
shaking
from
head
to
foot
at
the
mere
recollection
of
the
sound
of
Mr
Bumble
's
voice
.
   
<EOS>
He
need
n't
haven
taken
the
trouble
to
shrink
from
Mr
Bumble
's
glance
,
however
;
for
that
functionary
,
on
whom
the
prediction
of
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
had
made
a
very
strong
impression
,
thought
that
now
the
undertaker
had
got
Oliver
upon
trial
the
subject
was
better
avoided
,
until
such
time
as
he
should
be
firmly
bound
for
seven
years
,
and
all
danger
of
his
being
returned
upon
the
hands
of
the
parish
should
be
thus
effectually
and
legally
overcome
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
Mr
Sowerberry
,
taking
up
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
sooner
this
job
is
done
,
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
Noah
,
look
after
the
shop
.
<EOS>
Oliver
,
put
on
your
cap
,
and
come
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Oliver
obeyed
,
and
followed
his
master
on
his
professional
mission
.
   
<EOS>
They
walked
on
,
for
some
time
,
through
the
most
crowded
and
densely
inhabited
part
of
the
town
;
and
then
,
striking
down
a
narrow
street
more
dirty
and
miserable
than
any
they
had
yet
passed
through
,
paused
to
look
for
the
house
which
was
the
object
of
their
search
.
 
<EOS>
The
houses
on
either
side
were
high
and
large
,
but
very
old
,
and
tenanted
by
people
of
the
poorest
class
:
 
as
their
neglected
appearance
would
have
sufficiently
dentoed
,
without
the
concurrent
testimony
afforded
by
the
squalid
looks
of
the
few
men
and
women
who
,
with
folded
arms
and
bodies
half
doubled
,
occasionally
skulked
along
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
many
of
the
tenements
had
shop
-
fronts
;
but
these
were
fast
closed
,
and
mouldering
away
;
only
the
upper
rooms
being
inhabited
.
 
<EOS>
Some
houses
which
had
become
insecure
from
age
and
decay
,
were
prevented
from
falling
into
the
street
,
by
huge
beams
of
wood
reared
against
the
walls
,
and
firmly
planted
in
the
road
;
but
even
these
crazy
dens
seemed
to
have
been
selected
as
the
nightly
haunts
of
some
houseless
wretches
,
for
many
of
the
rough
boards
which
supplied
the
place
of
door
and
window
,
were
wrenched
from
their
positions
,
to
afford
an
aperture
wide
enough
for
the
passage
of
a
human
body
.
 
<EOS>
The
kennel
was
stagnant
and
filthy
.
<EOS>
The
very
rats
,
which
here
and
there
lay
putrefying
in
its
rottenness
,
were
hideous
with
famine
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
neither
knocker
nor
bell
-
handle
at
the
open
door
where
Oliver
and
his
master
stopped
;
so
,
groping
his
way
cautiously
through
the
dark
passage
,
and
bidding
Oliver
keep
close
to
him
and
not
be
afraid
the
undertaker
mounted
to
the
top
of
the
first
flight
of
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
Stumbling
against
a
door
on
the
landing
,
he
rapped
at
it
with
his
knuckles
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
opened
by
a
young
girl
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
.
 
<EOS>
The
undertaker
at
once
saw
enough
of
what
the
room
contained
,
to
know
it
was
the
apartment
to
which
he
had
been
directed
.
 
<EOS>
He
stepped
in
;
Oliver
followed
him
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
fire
in
the
room
;
but
a
man
was
crouching
,
mechanically
,
over
the
empty
stove
.
 
<EOS>
An
old
woman
,
too
,
had
drawn
a
low
stool
to
the
cold
hearth
,
and
was
sitting
beside
him
.
<EOS>
There
were
some
ragged
children
in
another
corner
;
and
in
a
small
recess
,
opposite
the
door
,
there
lay
upon
the
ground
,
something
covered
with
an
old
blanket
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
shuddered
as
he
cast
his
eyes
toward
the
place
,
and
crept
involuntarily
closer
to
his
master
;
for
though
it
was
covered
up
,
the
boy
felt
that
it
was
a
corpse
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
's
face
was
thin
and
very
pale
;
his
hair
and
beard
were
grizzly
;
his
eyes
were
blookshot
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
woman
's
face
was
wrinkled
;
her
two
remaining
teeth
protruded
over
her
under
lip
;
and
her
eyes
were
bright
and
piercing
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
was
afriad
to
look
at
either
her
or
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
They
seemed
so
like
the
rats
he
had
seen
outside
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nobody
shall
go
near
her
,
"
said
the
man
,
starting
fiercely
up
,
as
the
undertaker
approached
the
recess
.
 
<EOS>
"
Keep
back
!
<EOS>
Damn
you
,
keep
back
,
if
you
've
a
life
to
lose
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
my
good
man
,
"
said
the
undertaker
,
who
was
pretty
well
used
to
misery
in
all
its
shapes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
"
said
the
man
:
 
clenching
his
hands
,
and
stamping
furiously
on
the
floor
,
---
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
I
wo
n't
have
her
put
into
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
n't
rest
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
worms
would
worry
her
---
not
eat
her
---
<EOS>
she
is
so
worn
away
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
undertaker
offered
no
reply
to
this
raving
;
but
producing
a
tape
from
his
pocket
,
knelt
down
for
a
moment
by
the
side
of
the
body
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
man
:
 
bursting
into
tears
,
and
sinking
on
his
knees
at
the
feet
of
the
dead
woman
;
"
kneel
down
,
kneel
down
 
---
kneel
round
her
,
every
one
of
you
,
and
mark
my
words
!
 
<EOS>
I
say
she
was
starved
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
knew
how
bad
she
was
,
till
the
fever
came
upon
her
;
and
then
her
bones
were
starting
through
the
skin
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
neither
fire
nor
candle
;
she
died
in
the
dark
---
in
the
dark
!
 
<EOS>
She
could
n't
even
see
her
children
's
faces
,
though
we
heard
her
gasping
out
their
names
.
<EOS>
I
begged
for
her
in
the
streets
:
 
and
they
sent
me
to
prison
.
<EOS>
When
I
came
back
,
she
was
dying
;
and
all
the
blood
in
my
heart
has
dried
up
,
for
they
starved
her
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
I
swear
it
before
the
God
that
saw
it
!
<EOS>
They
starved
her
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
twined
his
hands
in
his
hair
;
and
,
with
a
loud
scream
,
rolled
grovelling
upon
the
floor
:
 
his
eyes
fixed
,
and
the
foam
covering
his
lips
.
   
<EOS>
The
terrified
children
cried
bitterly
;
but
the
old
woman
,
who
had
hitherto
remained
as
quiet
as
if
she
had
been
wholly
deaf
to
all
that
passed
,
menaced
them
into
silence
.
 
<EOS>
Having
unloosened
the
cravat
of
the
man
who
still
remained
extended
on
the
ground
,
she
tottered
towards
the
undertaker
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
was
my
daughter
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
nodding
her
head
in
the
direction
of
the
corpse
;
and
speaking
with
an
idiotic
leer
,
more
ghastly
than
even
the
presence
of
death
in
such
a
place
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lord
,
Lord
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
it
IS
strange
that
I
who
gave
birth
to
her
,
and
was
a
woman
then
,
should
be
alive
and
merry
now
,
and
she
lying
ther
:
 
so
cold
and
stiff
!
 
<EOS>
Lord
,
Lord
!
<EOS>
---
to
think
of
it
;
it
's
as
good
as
a
play
---
as
good
as
a
play
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
wretched
creature
mumbled
and
chuckled
in
her
hideous
merriment
,
the
undertaker
turned
to
go
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
,
stop
!
"
said
the
old
woman
in
a
loud
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
she
be
buried
to
-
morrow
,
or
next
day
,
or
to
-
night
?
 
<EOS>
I
laid
her
out
;
and
I
must
walk
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Send
me
a
large
cloak
:
a
good
warm
one
:
for
it
is
bitter
cold
.
 
<EOS>
We
should
have
cake
and
wine
,
too
,
before
we
go
!
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
;
send
some
bread
---
only
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
cup
of
water
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
we
have
some
bread
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
eagerly
:
   
catching
at
the
undertaker
's
coat
,
as
he
once
more
moved
towards
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
"
said
the
undertaker
,
"
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
Anything
you
like
!
"
<EOS>
He
disengaged
himself
from
the
old
woman
's
grasp
;
and
,
drawing
Oliver
after
him
,
hurried
away
.
   
<EOS>
The
next
day
,
(
the
family
having
been
meanwhile
relieved
with
a
half
-
quartern
loaf
and
a
piece
of
cheese
,
left
with
them
by
Mr
Bumble
himself
,
)
<EOS>
Oliver
and
his
master
returned
to
the
miserable
abode
;
where
Mr
Bumble
had
already
arrived
,
accompanied
by
four
men
from
the
workhouse
,
who
were
to
act
as
bearers
.
 
<EOS>
An
old
black
cloak
had
been
thrown
over
the
rags
of
the
old
woman
and
the
man
;
and
the
bare
coffin
having
been
screwed
down
,
was
hoisted
on
the
shoulders
of
the
bearers
,
and
carried
into
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
you
must
put
your
best
leg
foremost
,
old
lady
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Sowerberry
in
the
old
woman
's
ear
;
"
we
are
rather
late
;
and
it
wo
n't
do
,
to
keep
the
clergyman
waiting
.
 
<EOS>
Move
on
,
my
men
,
---
as
quick
as
you
like
!
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
directed
,
the
bearers
trotted
on
under
their
light
burden
;
and
the
two
mourners
kept
as
near
them
,
as
they
could
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
and
Sowerberry
walked
at
a
good
smart
pace
in
front
;
and
Oliver
,
whose
legs
were
not
so
long
as
his
master
's
,
ran
by
the
side
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
not
so
great
a
necessity
for
hurrying
as
Mr
Sowerberry
had
anticipated
,
however
;
for
when
they
reached
the
obscure
corner
of
the
churchyard
in
which
the
nettles
grew
,
and
where
the
parish
graves
were
made
,
the
clergyman
had
not
arrived
;
and
the
clerk
,
who
was
sitting
by
the
vestry
-
room
fire
,
seemed
to
think
it
by
no
means
improbable
that
it
might
be
an
hour
or
so
,
before
he
came
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
they
put
the
bier
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
;
and
the
two
mourners
waited
patiently
in
the
damp
clay
,
with
a
cold
rain
drizzling
down
,
while
the
ragged
boys
whom
the
spectacle
had
attracted
into
the
churchyard
played
a
noisy
game
at
hide
-
and
-
seek
among
the
tombstones
,
or
varied
their
amusements
by
jumping
backwards
and
forwards
over
the
coffin
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sowerberry
and
Bumble
,
being
personal
friends
of
the
clerk
,
sat
by
the
fire
with
him
,
and
read
the
paper
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
,
after
a
lapse
of
something
more
than
an
hour
,
Mr
Bumble
,
and
Sowerberry
,
and
the
clerk
,
were
seen
running
towards
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
Immediately
afterwards
,
the
clergyman
appeared
:
putting
on
his
surplice
as
he
came
along
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
then
thrashed
a
boy
or
two
,
to
keep
up
appearances
;
and
the
reverend
gentleman
,
having
read
as
much
of
the
burial
service
as
could
be
compressed
into
four
minutes
,
gave
his
surplice
to
the
clerk
,
and
walked
away
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Bill
!
"
said
Sowerberry
to
the
grave
-
digger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fill
up
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
no
very
difficult
task
,
for
the
grave
was
so
full
,
that
the
uppermost
coffin
was
within
a
few
feet
of
the
surface
.
 
<EOS>
The
grave
-
digger
shovelled
in
the
earth
;
stamped
it
loosely
down
with
his
feet
:
 
shouldered
his
spade
;
and
walked
off
,
followed
by
the
boys
,
who
murmured
very
loud
complaints
at
the
fun
being
over
so
soon
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
my
good
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
said
Bumble
,
tapping
the
man
on
the
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
want
to
shut
up
the
yard
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
man
who
had
never
once
moved
,
since
he
had
taken
his
station
by
the
grave
side
,
started
,
raised
his
head
,
stared
at
the
person
who
had
addressed
him
,
walked
forward
for
a
few
paces
;
and
fell
down
in
a
swoon
.
 
<EOS>
The
crazy
old
woman
was
too
much
occupied
in
bewailing
the
loss
of
her
cloak
(
which
the
undertaker
had
taken
off
)
,
to
pay
him
any
attention
;
so
they
threw
a
can
of
cold
water
over
him
;
and
when
he
came
to
,
saw
him
safely
out
of
the
churchyard
,
locked
the
gate
,
and
departed
on
their
different
ways
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Oliver
,
"
said
Sowerberry
,
as
they
walked
home
,
"
how
do
you
like
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
,
thank
you
,
sir
"
replied
Oliver
,
with
considerable
hesitation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
very
much
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
'll
get
used
to
it
in
time
,
Oliver
,
"
said
Sowerberry
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
when
you
ARE
used
to
it
,
my
boy
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
wondered
,
in
his
own
mind
,
whether
it
had
taken
a
very
long
time
to
get
Mr
Sowerberry
used
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
thought
it
better
not
to
ask
the
question
;
and
walked
back
to
the
shop
:
thinking
over
all
he
had
seen
and
heard
.
      
<EOS>
Chapter
6
.
<EOS>
Oliver
,
being
goaded
by
the
taunts
of
Noah
,
rouses
into
action
,
and
rather
astonishes
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
month
's
trial
over
,
Oliver
was
formally
apprenticed
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
nice
sickly
season
just
at
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
In
commercial
phrase
,
coffins
were
looking
up
;
and
,
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
,
Oliver
acquired
a
great
deal
of
experience
.
 
<EOS>
The
success
of
Mr
Sowerberry
's
ingenious
speculation
,
exceeded
even
his
most
sanguine
hopes
.
 
<EOS>
The
oldest
inhabitants
recollected
no
period
at
which
measles
had
been
so
prevalent
,
or
so
fatal
to
infant
existence
;
and
many
were
the
mournful
processions
which
little
Oliver
headed
,
in
a
hat
-
band
reaching
down
to
his
knees
,
to
the
indescribable
admiration
and
emotion
of
all
the
mothers
in
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
As
Oliver
accompanied
his
master
in
most
of
his
adult
expeditions
too
,
in
order
that
he
might
acquire
that
equanimity
of
demeanour
and
full
command
of
nerve
which
was
essential
to
a
finished
undertaker
,
he
had
many
opportunities
of
observing
the
beautiful
resignation
and
fortitude
with
which
some
strong
-
minded
people
bear
their
trials
and
losses
.
   
<EOS>
For
instance
;
when
Sowerberry
had
an
order
for
the
burial
of
some
rich
old
lady
or
gentleman
,
who
was
surrounded
by
a
great
number
of
nephews
and
nieces
,
who
had
been
perfectly
inconsolable
during
the
previous
illness
,
and
whose
grief
had
been
wholly
irrepressible
even
on
the
most
public
occasions
,
they
would
be
as
happy
among
themselves
as
need
be
---
quite
cheerful
and
contented
---
conversing
together
with
as
much
freedom
and
gaiety
,
as
if
nothing
whatever
had
happened
to
disturb
them
.
 
<EOS>
Husbands
,
too
,
bore
the
loss
of
their
wives
with
the
most
heroic
calmness
.
<EOS>
Wives
,
again
,
put
on
weeds
for
their
husbands
,
as
if
,
so
far
from
grieving
in
the
garb
of
sorrow
,
they
had
made
up
their
minds
to
render
it
as
becoming
and
attractive
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
observable
,
too
,
that
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
were
in
passions
of
anguish
during
the
ceremony
of
interment
,
recovered
almost
as
soon
as
they
reached
home
,
and
became
quite
composed
before
the
tea
-
drinking
was
over
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
was
very
pleasant
and
improving
to
see
;
and
Oliver
beheld
it
with
great
admiration
.
   
<EOS>
That
Oliver
Twist
was
moved
to
resignation
by
the
example
of
these
good
people
,
I
can
not
,
although
I
am
his
biographer
,
undertake
to
affirm
with
any
degree
of
confidence
;
but
I
can
most
distinctly
say
,
that
for
many
months
he
continued
meekly
to
submit
to
the
domination
and
ill
-
treatment
of
Noah
Claypole
:
 
who
used
him
far
worse
than
before
,
now
that
his
jealousy
was
roused
by
seeing
the
new
boy
promoted
to
the
black
stick
and
hatband
,
while
he
,
the
old
one
,
remained
stationary
in
the
muffin
-
cap
and
leathers
.
 
<EOS>
Charlotte
treated
him
ill
,
because
Noah
did
;
and
Mrs
Sowerberry
was
his
decided
enemy
,
because
Mr
Sowerberry
was
disposed
to
be
his
friend
;
so
,
between
these
three
on
one
side
,
and
a
glut
of
funerals
on
the
other
,
Oliver
was
not
altogether
as
comfortable
as
the
hungry
pig
was
,
when
he
was
shut
up
,
by
mistake
,
in
the
grain
department
of
a
brewery
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
,
I
come
to
a
very
important
passage
in
Oliver
's
history
;
for
I
have
to
record
an
act
,
slight
and
unimportant
perhaps
in
appearance
,
but
which
indirectly
produced
a
material
change
in
all
his
future
prospects
and
proceedings
.
   
<EOS>
One
day
,
Oliver
and
Noah
had
descended
into
the
kitchen
at
the
usual
dinner
-
hour
,
to
banquet
upon
a
small
joint
of
mutton
---
a
pound
and
a
half
of
the
worst
end
of
the
neck
---
when
Charlotte
being
called
out
of
the
way
,
there
ensued
a
brief
interval
of
time
,
which
Noah
Claypole
,
being
hungry
and
vicious
,
considered
he
could
not
possibly
devote
to
a
worthier
purpose
than
aggravating
and
tantalising
young
Oliver
Twist
.
   
<EOS>
Intent
upon
this
innocent
amusement
,
Noah
put
his
feet
on
the
table
-
cloth
;
and
pulled
Oliver
's
hair
;
and
twitched
his
ears
;
and
expressed
his
opinion
that
he
was
a
"
sneak
"
;
and
furthermore
announced
his
intention
of
coming
to
see
him
hanged
,
whenever
that
desirable
event
should
take
place
;
and
entered
upon
various
topics
of
petty
annoyance
,
like
a
malicious
and
ill
-
conditioned
charity
-
boy
as
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
making
Oliver
cry
,
Noah
attempted
to
be
more
facetious
still
;
and
in
his
attempt
,
did
what
many
sometimes
do
to
this
day
,
when
they
want
to
be
funny
.
 
<EOS>
He
got
rather
personal
.
   
<EOS>
"
Work'us
,
"
said
Noah
,
"
how
's
your
mother
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
's
dead
,
"
replied
Oliver
;
"
do
n't
you
say
anything
about
her
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
's
colour
rose
as
he
said
this
;
he
breathed
quickly
;
and
there
was
a
curious
working
of
the
mouth
and
nostrils
,
which
Mr
Claypole
thought
must
be
the
immediate
precursor
of
a
violent
fit
of
crying
.
 
<EOS>
Under
this
impression
he
returned
to
the
charge
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
she
die
of
,
Work'us
?
"
said
Noah
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
a
broken
heart
,
some
of
our
old
nurses
told
me
,
"
replied
Oliver
:
 
more
as
if
he
were
talking
to
himself
,
than
answering
Noah
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
know
what
it
must
be
to
die
of
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tol

<EOS>
Work'us

"
said
Noah
,
as
a
tear
rolled
down
Oliver
's
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
set
you
a
snivelling
now
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
YOU
,
"
replied
Oliver
,
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
;
that
's
enough
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
say
anything
more
to
me
about
her
;
you
'd
better
not
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Better
not

"
exclaimed
Noah
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well

<EOS>
Better

<EOS>
Work'us

YOUR

She

<EOS>
she
was

<EOS>
Oh
,
Lor

"
 
<EOS>
And
here
,
Noah
nodded
his
head
expressively
;
and
curled
up
as
much
of
his
small
red
nose
as
muscular
action
could
collect
together
,
for
the
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yer
know
,
Work'us
,
"
continued
Noah
,
emboldened
by
Oliver
's
silence
,
and
speaking
in
a
jeering
tone
of
affected
pity
:
 
of
all
tones
<EOS>
the
most
annoying
:
 
"
Yer
know
,
Work'us
,
it
ca
n't
be
helped
now
;
and
of
course
yer
could
n't
help
it
then
;
and
I
am
very
sorry
for
it
;
and
I
'm
sure
we
all
are
,
and
pity
yer
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
But
yer
must
know
,
Work'us
,
yer
mother
was
a
regular
right
-
down
bad
'
un
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
say
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Oliver
,
looking
up
very
quickly
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
regular
right
-
down
bad
'
un
,
Work'us
,
"
replied
Noah
,
coolly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
it
's
a
great
deal
better
,
Work'us
,
that
she
died
when
she
did
,
or
else
she
'd
have
been
hard
labouring
in
Bridewell
,
or
transported
,
or
hung
;
which
is
more
likely
than
either
,
is
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
Crimson
with
fury
,
Oliver
started
up
;
overthrew
the
chair
and
table
;
seized
Noah
by
the
throat
;
shook
him
,
in
the
violence
of
his
rage
,
till
his
teeth
chattered
in
his
head
;
and
collecting
his
whole
force
into
one
heavy
blow
,
felled
him
to
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
A
minute
ago
,
the
boy
had
looked
the
quiet
child
,
mild
,
dejected
creature
that
harsh
treatment
had
made
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
spirit
was
roused
at
last
;
the
cruel
insult
to
his
dead
mother
had
set
his
blood
on
fire
.
 
<EOS>
His
breast
heaved
;
his
attitude
was
erect
;
his
eye
bright
and
vivid
;
his
whole
person
changed
,
as
he
stood
glaring
over
the
cowardly
tormentor
who
now
lay
crouching
at
his
feet
;
and
defied
him
with
an
energy
he
had
never
known
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
'll
murder
me
!
"
<EOS>
blubbered
Noah
.
 
<EOS>
"
Charlotte
!
 
<EOS>
missis
!
 
<EOS>
Here
's
the
new
boy
a
murdering
of
me
!
 
<EOS>
Help

<EOS>
help
!
 
<EOS>
Oliver
's
gone
mad
!
<EOS>
Char

"
   
<EOS>
Noah
's
shouts
were
responded
to
,
by
a
loud
scream
from
Charlotte
,
and
a
louder
from
Mrs
Sowerberry
;
the
former
of
whom
rushed
into
the
kitchen
by
a
side
-
door
,
while
the
latter
paused
on
the
staircase
till
she
was
quite
certain
that
it
was
consistent
with
the
preservation
of
human
life
,
to
come
further
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
little
wretch
!
"
<EOS>
screamed
Charlotte
:
 
seizing
Oliver
with
her
utmost
force
,
which
was
about
equal
to
that
of
a
moderately
strong
man
in
particularly
good
training
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
little
un
-
grate
-
ful
,
mur
-
de
-
rous
,
hor
-
rid
villain
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
between
every
syllable
,
Charlotte
gave
Oliver
a
blow
with
all
her
might
:
accompanying
it
with
a
scream
,
for
the
benefit
of
society
.
   
<EOS>
Charlotte
's
fist
was
by
no
means
a
light
one
;
but
,
lest
it
should
not
be
effectual
in
calming
Oliver
's
wrath
,
Mrs
Sowerberry
plunged
into
the
kitchen
,
and
assisted
to
hold
him
with
one
hand
,
while
she
scratched
his
face
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
In
this
favourable
position
of
affairs
,
Noah
rose
from
the
ground
,
and
pommelled
him
behind
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
rather
too
violent
exercise
to
last
long
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
were
all
wearied
out
,
and
could
tear
and
beat
no
longer
,
they
dragged
Oliver
,
struggling
and
shouting
,
but
nothing
daunted
,
into
the
dust
-
cellar
,
and
there
locked
him
up
.
 
<EOS>
This
being
done
,
Mrs
Sowerberry
sunk
into
a
chair
,
and
burst
into
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
her
,
she
's
going
off
!
"
said
Charlotte
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
glass
of
water
,
Noah
,
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Make
haste
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
Charlotte
,
"
said
Mrs
Sowerberry
:
 
speaking
as
well
as
she
could
,
through
a
deficiency
of
breath
,
and
a
sufficiency
of
cold
water
,
which
Noah
had
poured
over
her
head
and
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
Charlotte
,
what
a
mercy
we
have
not
all
been
murdered
in
our
beds
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
mercy
indeed
,
ma'am
,
"
was
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
hope
this'll
teach
master
not
to
have
any
more
of
these
dreadful
creatures
,
that
are
born
to
be
murderers
and
robbers
from
their
very
cradle
.
   
<EOS>
Poor
Noah
!
 
<EOS>
He
was
all
but
killed
,
ma'am
,
when
I
come
in
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
fellow
!
"
said
Mrs
Sowerberry
:
 
looking
piteously
on
the
charity
-
boy
.
   
<EOS>
Noah
,
whose
top
waistcoat
-
button
might
have
been
somewhere
on
a
level
with
the
crown
of
Oliver
's
head
,
rubbed
his
eyes
with
the
inside
of
his
wrists
while
this
commiseration
was
bestowed
upon
him
,
and
performed
some
affecting
tears
and
sniffs
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
to
be
done
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Sowerberry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
master
's
not
at
home
;
there
's
not
a
man
in
the
house
,
and
he
'll
kick
that
door
down
in
ten
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Oliver
's
vigorous
plunges
against
the
bit
of
timber
in
question
,
rendered
this
occurance
highly
probable
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Charlotte
,
"
unless
we
send
for
the
police
-
officers
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Or
the
millingtary
,
"
suggested
Mr
Claypole
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Mrs
Sowerberry
:
 
bethinking
herself
of
Oliver
's
old
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
Run
to
Mr
Bumble
,
Noah
,
and
tell
him
to
come
here
directly
,
and
not
to
lose
a
minute
;
never
mind
your
cap
!
 
<EOS>
Make
haste
!
 
<EOS>
You
can
hold
a
knife
to
that
black
eye
,
as
you
run
along
.
   
<EOS>
It
'll
keep
the
swelling
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
Noah
stopped
to
make
no
reply
,
but
started
off
at
his
fullest
speed
;
and
very
much
it
astonished
the
people
who
were
out
walking
,
to
see
a
charity
-
boy
tearing
through
the
streets
pell
-
mell
,
with
no
cap
on
his
head
,
and
a
clasp
-
knife
at
his
eye
.

Chapter
7
.
<EOS>
Oliver
continues
refractory
.
 
<EOS>
Noah
Claypole
ran
along
the
streets
at
his
swiftest
pace
,
and
paused
not
once
for
breath
,
until
he
reached
the
workhouse
-
gate
.
<EOS>
Having
rested
here
,
for
a
minute
or
so
,
to
collect
a
good
burst
of
sobs
and
an
imposing
show
of
tears
and
terror
,
he
knocked
loudly
at
the
wicket
;
and
presented
such
a
rueful
face
to
the
aged
pauper
who
opened
it
,
that
even
he
,
who
saw
nothing
but
rueful
faces
about
him
at
the
best
of
times
,
started
back
in
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
what
's
the
matter
with
the
boy
!
"
said
the
old
pauper
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Bumble
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
!
"
cried
Noah
,
wit
well
-
affected
dismay
:
and
in
tones
so
loud
and
agitated
,
that
they
not
only
caught
the
ear
of
Mr
Bumble
himself
,
who
happened
to
be
hard
by
,
but
alarmed
him
so
much
that
he
rushed
into
the
yard
without
his
cocked
hat
,
 
---
which
is
a
very
curious
and
remarkable
circumstance
:
 
as
showing
that
even
a
beadle
,
acted
upon
a
sudden
and
powerful
impulse
,
may
be
afflicted
with
a
momentary
visitation
of
loss
of
self
-
possession
,
and
forgetfulness
of
personal
dignity
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mr
Bumble
,
sir
!
"
said
Noah
:
 
<EOS>
"
Oliver
,
sir
,
 
---
Oliver
has
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
What
?
 
<EOS>
What
?
<EOS>
"
interposed
Mr
Bumble
:
 
with
a
gleam
of
pleasure
in
his
metallic
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
run
away
;
he
has
n't
run
away
,
has
he
,
Noah
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
Not
run
away
,
sir
,
but
he
's
turned
wicious
,
"
replied
Noah
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
tried
to
murder
me
,
sir
;
and
then
he
tried
to
murder
Charlotte
;
and
then
missis
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
what
dreadful
pain
it
is
!
   
<EOS>
Such
agony
,
please
,
sir
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
here
,
Noah
writhed
and
twisted
his
body
into
an
extensive
variety
of
eel
-
like
positions
;
thereby
giving
Mr
Bumble
to
understand
that
,
from
the
violent
and
sanguinary
onset
of
Oliver
Twist
,
he
had
sustained
severe
internal
injury
and
damage
,
from
which
he
was
at
that
moment
suffering
the
acutest
torture
.
   
<EOS>
When
Noah
saw
that
the
intelligence
he
communicated
perfectly
paralysed
Mr
Bumble
,
he
imparted
additional
effect
thereunto
,
by
bewailing
his
dreadful
wounds
ten
times
louder
than
before
;
and
when
he
observed
a
gentleman
in
a
white
waistcoat
crossing
the
yard
,
he
was
more
tragic
in
his
lamentations
than
ever
:
 
rightly
conceiving
it
highly
expedient
to
attract
the
notice
,
and
rouse
the
indignation
,
of
the
gentleman
aforesaid
.
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
's
notice
was
very
soon
attracted
;
for
he
had
not
walked
three
paces
,
when
he
turned
angrily
round
,
and
inquired
what
that
young
cur
was
howling
for
,
and
why
Mr
Bumble
did
not
favour
him
with
something
which
would
render
the
series
of
vocular
exclamations
so
designated
,
an
involuntary
process
?
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
poor
boy
from
the
free
-
school
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Bumble
,
"
who
has
been
nearly
murdered
---
<EOS>
all
but
murdered
,
sir
,
 
---
by
young
Twist
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
By
Jove
!
"
exclaimed
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
,
stopping
short
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
it
!
 
<EOS>
I
felt
a
strange
presentiment
from
the
very
first
,
that
that
audacious
young
savage
would
come
to
be
hung
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
likewise
attempted
,
sir
,
to
murder
the
female
servant
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
with
a
face
of
ashy
paleness
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
his
missis
,
"
interposed
Mr
Claypole
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
his
master
,
too

I
think
you
said
,
Noah
?
"
added
Mr
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
he
's
out
,
or
he
would
have
murdered
him
,
"
replied
Noah
.
"
<EOS>
He
said
he
wanted
to
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Said
he
wanted
to
<EOS>
,
did
he
,
my
boy

"
inquired
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir

"
replied
Noah
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
please
,
sir

missis
wants
to
know
whether
Mr
Bumble
can
spare
time
to
step
up
there

directly

flog
him
---
 
'cause
master
's
out

"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
my
boy
;
certainly

"
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
:
 
<EOS>
smiling
benignly
,
and
patting
Noah
's
head
,
which
was
about
three
inches
higher
than
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
good
boy

a
very
good

Here
's
a

"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
will
not

sir

"
replied
the
beadle
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
cocked
hat
and
cane
having
been
,
by
this
time
,
adjusted
to
their
owner
's
satisfaction
,
Mr
Bumble
and
Noah
Claypole
betook
themselves
with
all
speed
to
the
undertaker
's
shop
.
   
<EOS>
Here
the
position
of
affairs
had
not
at
all
improved

Sowerberry
had
not
yet
returned
,
and
Oliver
continued
to
kick
,
with
undiminished
vigour
,
at
the
cellar
-
door
.
 
<EOS>
The
accounts
of
his
ferocity
as
related
by
Mrs
Sowerberry
and
Charlotte
,
were
of
so
startling
a
nature
,
that
Mr
Bumble
judged
it
prudent
to
parley
,
before
opening
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
view
he
gave
a
kick
at
the
outside
,
by
way
of
prelude
;
and
,
then
,
applying
his
mouth
to
the
keyhole
,
said
,
in
a
deep
and
impressive
tone
:
   
"
Oliver
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
;
you
let
me
out
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Oliver
,
from
the
inside
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
this
here
voice
,
Oliver
?
"
said
Mr
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ai
n't
you
afraid
of
it
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Ai
n't
you
a
-
trembling
while
I
speak
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
replied
Oliver
,
boldly
.
   
<EOS>
An
answer
so
different
from
the
one
he
had
expected
to
elicit
,
and
was
in
the
habit
of
receiving
,
staggered
Mr
Bumble
not
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
He
stepped
back
from
the
keyhole
;
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
;
and
looked
from
one
to
another
of
the
three
bystanders
,
in
mute
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
know
,
Mr
Bumble
,
he
must
be
mad
,
"
said
Mrs
Sowerberry
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
boy
in
half
his
senses
could
venture
to
speak
so
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
Madness
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
Mr
Bumble
,
after
a
few
moments
of
deep
meditation
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
Meat
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Sowerberry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Meat
,
ma'am
,
meat
,
"
replied
Bumble
,
with
stern
emphasis
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
over
-
fed
him
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
You
've
raised
a
artificial
soul
and
spirit
in
him
,
ma'am
unbecoming
a
person
of
his
condition
:
as
the
board
,
Mrs
Sowerberry
,
who
are
practical
philosophers
,
will
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
What
have
paupers
to
do
with
soul
or
spirit
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
quite
enough
that
we
let
'em
have
live
bodies
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
had
kept
the
boy
on
gruel
,
ma'am
,
this
would
never
have
happened
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mrs
Sowerberry
,
piously
raising
her
eyes
to
the
kitchen
ceiling
:
 
<EOS>
"
this
comes
of
being
liberal
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
liberality
of
Mrs
Sowerberry
to
Oliver
,
had
consisted
of
a
profuse
bestowal
upon
him
of
all
the
dirty
odds
and
ends
which
nobody
else
would
eat
;
so
there
was
a
great
deal
of
meekness
and
self
-
devotion
in
her
voluntarily
remaining
under
Mr
Bumble
's
heavy
accusation
.
 
<EOS>
Of
which
,
to
do
her
justice
,
she
was
wholly
innocent
,
in
thought
,
word
,
or
deed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
when
the
lady
brought
her
eyes
down
to
earth
again
;
"
the
only
thing
that
can
be
done
now
,
that
I
know
of
,
is
to
leave
him
in
the
cellar
for
a
day
or
so
,
till
he
's
a
little
starved
down
;
and
then
to
take
him
out
,
and
keep
him
on
gruel
all
through
the
apprenticeship
.
 
<EOS>
He
comes
of
a
bad
family
.
<EOS>
Excitable
natures
,
Mrs
Sowerberry
!
 
<EOS>
Both
the
nurse
and
doctor
said
,
that
that
mother
of
his
made
her
way
here
,
against
difficulties
and
pain
that
would
have
killed
any
well
-
disposed
woman
,
weeks
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
point
of
Mr
Bumble
's
discourse
,
Oliver
,
just
hearing
enough
to
know
that
some
allusion
was
being
made
to
his
mother
,
recommenced
kicking
,
with
a
violence
that
rendered
every
other
sound
inaudible
.
 
<EOS>
Sowerberry
returned
at
this
juncture
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
's
offence
having
been
explained
to
him
,
with
such
exaggerations
as
the
ladies
thought
best
calculated
to
rouse
his
ire
,
he
unlocked
the
cellar
-
door
in
a
twinkling
,
and
dragged
his
rebellious
apprentice
out
,
by
the
collar
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
's
clothes
had
been
torn
in
the
beating
he
had
received
;
his
face
was
bruised
and
scratched
;
and
his
hair
scattered
over
his
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
The
angry
flush
had
not
disappeared
,
however
;
and
when
he
was
pulled
out
of
his
prison
,
he
scowled
boldly
on
Noah
,
and
looked
quite
undismayed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
you
are
a
nice
young
fellow
,
ai
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
said
Sowerberry
;
giving
Oliver
a
shake
,
and
a
box
on
the
ear
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
called
my
mother
names
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
and
what
if
he
did
,
you
little
ungrateful
wretch
?
"
said
Mrs
Sowerberry
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
deserved
what
he
said
,
and
worse
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
did
n't
"
said
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
did
,
"
said
Mrs
Sowerberry
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
lie
!
"
said
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Sowerberry
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
.
   
<EOS>
This
flood
of
tears
left
Mr
Sowerberry
no
alternative
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
hesitated
for
one
instant
to
punish
Oliver
most
severely
,
it
must
be
quite
clear
to
every
experienced
reader
that
he
would
have
been
,
according
to
all
precedents
in
disputes
of
matrimony
established
,
a
brute
,
an
unnatural
husband
,
an
insulting
creature
,
a
base
imitation
of
a
man
,
and
various
other
agreeable
characters
too
numerous
for
recital
within
the
limits
of
this
chapter
.
 
<EOS>
To
do
him
justice
,
he
was
,
as
far
as
his
power
went
---
it
was
not
very
extensive
---
kindly
disposed
towards
the
boy
;
perhaps
,
because
it
was
his
interest
to
be
so
;
perhaps
,
because
his
wife
disliked
him
.
<EOS>
The
flood
of
tears
,
however
,
left
him
no
resource
;
so
he
at
once
gave
him
a
drubbing
,
which
satisfied
even
Mrs
Sowerberry
herself
,
and
rendered
Mr
Bumble
's
subsequent
application
of
the
parochial
cane
,
rather
unnecessary
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
rest
of
the
day
,
he
was
shut
up
in
the
back
kitchen
,
in
company
with
a
pump
and
a
slice
of
bread
;
and
at
night
,
Mrs
Sowerberry
,
after
making
various
remarks
outside
the
door
,
by
no
means
complimentary
to
the
memory
of
his
mother
,
looked
into
the
room
,
and
,
amidst
the
jeers
and
pointings
of
Noah
and
Charlotte
,
ordered
him
upstairs
to
his
dismal
bed
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
he
was
left
alone
in
the
silence
and
stillness
of
the
gloomy
workshop
of
the
undertaker
,
that
Oliver
gave
way
to
the
feelings
which
the
day
's
treatment
may
be
supposed
likely
to
have
awakened
in
a
mere
child
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
listened
to
their
taunts
with
a
look
of
contempt
;
he
had
borne
the
lash
without
a
cry
:
for
he
felt
that
pride
swelling
in
his
heart
which
would
have
kept
down
a
shriek
to
the
last
,
though
they
had
roasted
him
alive
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
,
when
there
were
none
to
see
or
hear
him
,
he
fell
upon
his
knees
on
the
floor
;
and
,
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
,
wept
such
tears
as
,
God
send
for
the
credit
of
our
nature
,
few
so
young
may
ever
have
cause
to
pour
out
before
him
!
   
<EOS>
For
a
long
time
,
Oliver
remained
motionless
in
this
attitude
.
<EOS>
The
candle
was
burning
low
in
the
socket
when
he
rose
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
Having
gazed
cautiously
round
him
,
and
listened
intently
,
he
gently
undid
the
fastenings
of
the
door
,
and
looked
abroad
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
cold
,
dark
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
stars
seemed
,
to
the
boy
's
eyes
,
farther
from
the
earth
than
he
had
ever
seen
them
before
;
there
was
no
wind
;
and
the
sombre
shadows
thrown
by
the
trees
upon
the
ground
,
looked
sepulchral
and
death
-
like
,
from
being
so
still
.
<EOS>
He
softly
reclosed
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Having
availed
himself
of
the
expiring
light
of
the
candle
to
tie
up
in
a
handkerchief
the
few
articles
of
wearing
apparel
he
had
,
sat
himself
down
upon
a
bench
,
to
wait
for
morning
.
   
<EOS>
With
the
first
ray
of
light
that
struggled
through
the
crevices
in
the
shutters
,
Oliver
arose
,
and
again
unbarred
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
One
timid
look
around
---
<EOS>
one
moment
's
pause
of
hesitation
<EOS>
---
he
had
closed
it
behind
him
,
and
was
in
the
open
street
.
   
<EOS>
He
looked
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
,
uncertain
whither
to
fly
.
   
<EOS>
He
remembered
to
have
seen
the
waggons
,
as
they
went
out
,
toiling
up
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
the
same
route
;
and
arriving
at
a
footpath
across
the
fields
:
 
which
he
knew
,
after
some
distance
,
led
out
again
into
the
road
;
struck
into
it
,
and
walked
quickly
on
.
   
<EOS>
Along
this
same
footpath
,
Oliver
well
-
remembered
he
had
trotted
beside
Mr
Bumble
,
when
he
first
carried
him
to
the
workhouse
from
the
farm
.
 
<EOS>
His
way
lay
directly
in
front
of
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
His
heart
beat
quickly
when
he
bethought
himself
of
this
;
and
he
half
resolved
to
turn
back
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
come
a
long
way
though
,
and
should
lose
a
great
deal
of
time
by
doing
so
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
was
so
early
that
there
was
very
little
fear
of
his
being
seen
;
so
he
walked
on
.
   
<EOS>
He
reached
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
appearance
of
its
inmates
stirring
at
that
early
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
stopped
,
and
peeped
into
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
A
child
was
weeding
one
of
the
little
beds
;
as
he
stopped
,
he
raised
his
pale
face
and
disclosed
the
features
of
one
of
his
former
companions
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
felt
glad
to
see
him
,
before
he
went
;
for
,
though
younger
than
himself
,
he
had
been
his
little
friend
and
playmate
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
been
beaten
,
and
starved
,
and
shut
up
together
,
many
and
many
a
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
Dick
!
"
said
Oliver
,
as
the
boy
ran
to
the
gate
,
and
thrust
his
thin
arm
between
the
rails
to
greet
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
any
one
up
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nobody
but
me
,
"
replied
the
child
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
musn't
say
you
saw
me
,
Dick
,
"
said
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
running
away
.
 
<EOS>
They
beat
and
ill
-
use
me
,
Dick
;
and
I
am
going
to
seek
my
fortune
,
some
long
way
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
where
.
 
<EOS>
How
pale
you
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
heard
the
doctor
tell
them
I
was
dying
,
"
replied
the
child
with
a
faint
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
,
dear
;
but
do
n't
stop
,
do
n't
stop
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
I
will
,
to
say
good
-
b'ye
to
you
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
see
you
again
,
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
shall
!
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
well
and
happy
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
replied
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
"
After
I
am
dead
,
but
not
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
doctor
must
be
right
,
Oliver
,
because
I
dream
so
much
of
Heaven
,
and
Angels
,
and
kind
faces
that
I
never
see
when
I
am
awake
.
 
<EOS>
Kiss
me
,
"
said
the
child
,
 
climbing
up
the
low
gate
,
and
flinging
his
little
arms
round
Oliver
's
neck
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
-
b'ye
,
dear
!
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
blessing
was
from
a
young
child
's
lips
,
but
it
was
the
first
that
Oliver
had
ever
heard
invoked
upon
his
head
;
and
through
the
struggles
and
sufferings
,
and
troubles
and
changes
,
of
his
after
life
,
he
never
once
forgot
it
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
8
.
<EOS>
Oliver
walks
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
encounters
on
the
road
a
strange
sort
of
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
reached
the
stile
at
which
the
by
-
path
terminated
;
and
once
more
gained
the
high
-
road
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
eight
o'clock
now
.
<EOS>
Though
he
was
nearly
five
miles
away
from
the
town
,
he
ran
,
and
hid
behind
the
hedges
,
by
turns
,
till
noon
:
 
fearing
that
he
might
be
pursued
and
overtaken
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
sat
down
to
rest
by
the
side
of
the
milestone
,
and
began
to
think
,
for
the
first
time
,
where
he
had
better
go
and
try
to
live
.
   
<EOS>
The
stone
by
which
he
was
seated
,
bore
,
in
large
characters
,
an
intimation
that
it
was
just
seventy
miles
from
that
spot
to
London
.
<EOS>
The
name
awakened
a
new
train
of
ideas
in
the
boy
's
mind
.
   
<EOS>
London
!
<EOS>
---
that
great
place
!
<EOS>
---
nobody
---
not
even
Mr
Bumble
---
could
ever
find
him
there
!
 
<EOS>
He
had
often
heard
the
old
men
in
the
workhouse
,
too
,
say
that
no
lad
of
spirit
need
want
in
London
;
and
that
there
were
ways
of
living
in
that
vast
city
,
which
those
who
had
been
bred
up
in
country
parts
had
no
idea
of
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
very
place
for
a
homeless
boy
,
who
must
die
in
the
streets
unless
some
one
helped
him
.
<EOS>
As
these
things
passed
through
his
thoughts
,
he
jumped
upon
his
feet
,
and
again
walked
forward
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
diminished
the
distance
between
himself
and
London
by
full
four
miles
more
,
before
he
recollected
how
much
he
must
undergo
ere
he
could
hope
to
reach
his
place
of
destination
.
<EOS>
As
this
consideration
forced
itself
upon
him
,
he
slackened
his
pace
a
little
,
and
meditated
upon
his
means
of
getting
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
crust
of
bread
,
a
coarse
shirt
,
and
two
pairs
of
stockings
,
in
his
bundle
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
penny
too
---
a
gift
of
Sowerberry
's
after
some
funeral
in
which
he
had
acquitted
himself
more
than
ordinarily
well
---
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
clean
shirt
,
"
thought
Oliver
,
"
is
a
very
comfortable
thing
;
and
so
are
two
pairs
of
darned
stockings
;
and
so
is
a
penny
;
but
they
small
helps
to
a
sixty
-
five
miles
'
walk
in
winter
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
Oliver
's
thoughts
,
like
those
of
most
other
people
,
although
they
were
extremely
ready
and
active
to
point
out
his
difficulties
,
were
wholly
at
a
loss
to
suggest
any
feasible
mode
of
surmounting
them
;
so
,
after
a
good
deal
of
thinking
to
no
particular
purpose
,
he
changed
his
little
bundle
over
to
the
other
shoulder
,
and
trudged
on
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
walked
twenty
miles
that
day
;
and
all
that
time
tasted
nothing
<EOS>
but
the
crust
of
dry
bread
,
and
a
few
draughts
of
water
,
which
he
begged
at
the
cottage
-
doors
by
the
road
-
side
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
night
came
,
he
turned
into
a
meadow
;
and
,
creeping
close
under
a
hay
-
rick
,
determined
to
lie
there
,
till
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
frightened
at
first
,
for
the
wind
moaned
dismally
over
the
empty
fields
:
 
and
he
was
cold
and
hungry
,
and
more
alone
than
he
had
ever
felt
before
.
 
<EOS>
Being
very
tired
with
his
walk
,
however
,
he
soon
fell
asleep
and
forgot
his
troubles
.
   
<EOS>
He
felt
cold
and
stiff
,
when
he
got
up
next
morning
,
and
so
hungry
that
he
was
obliged
to
exchange
the
penny
for
a
small
loaf
,
in
the
very
first
village
through
which
he
passed
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
walked
no
more
than
twelve
miles
,
when
night
closed
in
again
.
<EOS>
His
feet
were
sore
,
and
his
legs
so
weak
that
they
trembled
beneath
him
.
 
<EOS>
Another
night
passed
in
the
bleak
damp
air
,
made
him
worse
;
when
he
set
forward
on
his
journey
next
morning
he
could
hardly
crawl
along
.
   
<EOS>
He
waited
at
the
bottom
of
a
steep
hill
till
a
stage
-
coach
came
up
,
and
then
begged
of
the
outside
passengers
;
but
there
were
very
few
who
took
any
notice
of
him
:
 
and
even
those
told
him
to
wait
till
they
got
to
the
top
of
the
hill
,
and
then
let
them
see
how
far
he
could
run
for
a
halfpenny
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Oliver
tried
to
keep
up
with
the
coach
a
little
way
,
but
was
unable
to
do
it
,
by
reason
of
his
fatigue
and
sore
feet
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
outsides
saw
this
,
they
put
their
halfpence
back
into
their
pockets
again
,
declaring
that
he
was
an
idle
young
dog
,
and
did
n't
deserve
anything
;
and
the
coach
rattled
away
and
left
only
a
cloud
of
dust
behind
.
   
<EOS>
In
some
villages
,
large
painted
boards
were
fixed
up
:
warning
all
persons
who
begged
within
the
district
,
that
they
would
be
sent
to
jail
.
 
<EOS>
This
frightened
Oliver
very
much
,
and
made
him
glad
to
get
out
of
those
villages
with
all
possible
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
In
others
,
he
would
stand
about
the
inn
-
yards
,
and
look
mournfully
at
every
one
who
passed
:
a
proceeding
which
generally
terminated
in
the
landlady
's
ordering
one
of
the
post
-
boys
who
were
lounging
about
,
to
drive
that
strange
boy
out
of
the
place
,
for
she
was
sure
he
had
come
to
steal
something
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
begged
at
a
farmer
's
house
,
ten
to
one
<EOS>
but
they
threatened
to
set
the
dog
on
him
;
and
when
he
showed
his
nose
in
a
shop
,
they
talked
about
the
beadle
---
which
brought
Oliver
's
heart
into
his
mouth
,
---
very
often
the
only
thing
he
had
there
,
for
many
hours
together
.
   
<EOS>
In
fact
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
good
-
hearted
turnpike
-
man
,
and
a
benevolent
old
lady
,
Oliver
's
troubles
would
have
been
shortened
by
the
very
same
process
which
had
put
an
end
to
his
mother
's
;
in
other
words
,
he
would
most
assuredly
have
fallen
dead
upon
the
king
's
highway
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
turnpike
-
man
gave
him
a
meal
of
bread
and
cheese
;
and
the
old
lady
,
who
had
a
shipwrecked
grandson
wandering
barefoot
in
some
distant
part
of
the
earth
,
took
pity
upon
the
poor
orphan
,
and
gave
him
what
little
she
could
afford
---
and
more
---
with
such
kind
and
gently
words
,
and
such
tears
of
sympathy
and
compassion
,
that
they
sank
deeper
into
Oliver
's
soul
,
than
all
the
sufferings
he
had
ever
undergone
.
   
<EOS>
Early
on
the
seventh
morning
after
he
had
left
his
native
place
,
Oliver
limped
slowly
into
the
little
town
of
Barnet
.
<EOS>
The
window
-
shutters
were
closed
;
the
street
was
empty
;
not
a
soul
had
awakened
to
the
business
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
was
rising
in
all
its
splendid
beauty
;
but
the
light
only
served
to
show
the
boy
his
own
lonesomeness
and
desolation
,
as
he
sat
,
with
bleeding
feet
and
covered
with
dust
,
upon
a
door
-
step
.
   
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
the
shutters
were
opened
;
the
window
-
blinds
were
drawn
up
;
and
people
began
passing
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
Some
few
stopped
to
gaze
at
Oliver
for
a
moment
or
two
,
or
turned
round
to
stare
at
him
as
they
hurried
by
;
but
none
relieved
him
,
or
troubled
themselves
to
inquire
how
he
came
there
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
heart
to
beg
.
<EOS>
And
there
he
sat
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
been
crouching
on
the
step
for
some
time
:
 
wondering
at
the
great
number
of
public
-
houses
(
every
other
house
in
Barnet
was
a
tavern
,
large
or
small
)
,
gazing
listlessly
at
the
coaches
as
they
passed
through
,
and
thinking
how
strange
it
seemed
that
they
could
do
,
with
ease
,
in
a
few
hours
,
what
it
had
taken
him
a
whole
week
of
courage
and
determination
beyond
his
years
to
accomplish
:
 
when
he
was
roused
by
observing
that
a
boy
,
who
had
passed
him
carelessly
some
minutes
before
,
had
returned
,
and
was
now
surveying
him
most
earnestly
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
little
heed
of
this
at
first
;
but
the
boy
remained
in
the
same
attitude
of
close
observation
so
long
,
that
Oliver
raised
his
head
,
and
returned
his
steady
look
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
boy
crossed
over
;
and
walking
close
up
to
Oliver
,
said
   
"
Hullo
,
my
covey
!
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
row
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
boy
who
addressed
this
inquiry
to
the
young
wayfarer
,
was
about
his
own
age
:
 
but
one
of
the
queerest
looking
boys
that
Oliver
had
even
seen
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
snub
-
nosed
,
flat
-
browed
,
common
-
faced
boy
enough
;
and
as
dirty
a
juvenile
as
one
would
wish
to
see
;
but
he
had
about
him
all
the
airs
and
manners
of
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
short
of
his
age
:
 
with
rather
bow
-
legs
,
and
little
,
sharp
,
ugly
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
His
hat
was
stuck
on
the
top
of
his
head
so
lightly
,
that
it
threatened
to
fall
off
every
moment
---
and
would
have
done
so
,
very
often
,
if
the
wearer
had
not
had
a
knack
of
every
now
and
then
giving
his
head
a
sudden
twitch
,
which
brought
it
back
to
its
old
place
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
wore
a
man
's
coat
,
which
reached
nearly
to
his
heels
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
turned
the
cuffs
back
,
half
-
way
up
his
arm
,
to
get
his
hands
out
of
the
sleeves
:
apparently
with
the
ultimated
view
of
thrusting
them
into
the
pockets
of
his
corduroy
trousers
;
for
there
he
kept
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
,
altogether
,
as
roystering
and
swaggering
a
young
gentleman
as
ever
stood
four
feet
six
,
or
something
less
,
in
the
bluchers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hullo
,
my
covey
!
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
row
?
"
said
this
strange
young
gentleman
to
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
hungry
and
tired
,
"
replied
Oliver
:
 
<EOS>
the
tears
standing
in
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
walked
a
long
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
walking
these
seven
days
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Walking
for
sivin
days
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
Beak
's
order
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
But
,
"
he
added
,
noticing
Oliver
's
look
of
surprise
,
"
I
suppose
you
do
n't
know
what
a
beak
is
,
my
flash
com
-
pan
-
i
-
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
mildly
replied
,
that
he
had
always
heard
a
bird
's
mouth
described
by
the
term
in
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
eyes
,
how
green
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
a
beak
's
a
madgst'rate
;
and
when
you
walk
by
a
beak
's
order
,
it
's
not
straight
forerd
,
but
always
agoing
up
,
and
niver
a
coming
down
agin
.
 
<EOS>
Was
you
never
on
the
mill
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
mill
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
mill
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
THE
mill
---
the
mill
as
takes
up
so
little
room
that
it
'll
work
inside
a
Stone
Jug
;
and
always
goes
better
when
the
wind
's
low
with
people
,
than
when
it
's
high
;
acos
then
they
ca
n't
get
workmen
.
 
<EOS>
But
come
,
"
said
the
young
gentleman
;
"
you
want
grub
,
and
you
shall
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
at
low
-
water
-
mark
myself
---
<EOS>
only
one
bob
and
a
magpie
;
but
,
as
far
as
it
goes
,
I
'll
fork
out
and
stump
.
 
<EOS>
Up
with
you
on
your
pins
.
 
<EOS>
There
!
 
<EOS>
Now
then
!
   
<EOS>
Morrice
!
"
   
<EOS>
Assisting
Oliver
to
rise
,
the
young
gentleman
took
him
to
an
adjacent
chandler
's
shop
,
where
he
purchased
a
sufficiency
of
ready
-
dressed
ham
and
a
half
-
quartern
loaf
,
or
,
as
he
himself
expressed
it
,
"
a
fourpenny
bran
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
ham
being
kept
clean
and
preserved
from
dust
,
by
the
ingenious
expedient
of
making
a
hole
in
the
loaf
by
pulling
out
a
portion
of
the
crumb
,
and
stuffing
it
therein
.
 
<EOS>
Taking
the
bread
under
his
arm
,
the
young
gentlman
turned
into
a
small
public
-
house
,
and
led
the
way
to
a
tap
-
room
in
the
rear
of
the
premises
.
<EOS>
Here
,
a
pot
of
beer
was
brought
in
,
by
direction
of
the
mysterious
youth
;
and
Oliver
,
falling
to
,
at
his
new
friend
's
bidding
,
made
a
long
and
hearty
meal
,
during
the
progress
of
which
the
strange
boy
eyed
him
from
time
to
time
with
great
attention
.
   
<EOS>
"
Going
to
London
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
strange
boy
,
when
Oliver
had
at
length
concluded
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
   
"
Got
any
lodgings
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
"
Money
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
strange
boy
whistled
;
and
put
his
arms
into
his
pockets
,
as
far
as
the
big
coat
-
sleeves
would
let
them
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
live
in
London
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
,
when
I
'm
at
home
,
"
replied
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
want
some
place
to
sleep
in
to
-
night
,
do
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
indeed
,
"
answered
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
slept
under
a
roof
since
I
left
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
n't
fret
your
eyelids
on
that
score
.
<EOS>
"
said
the
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
to
be
in
London
to
-
night
;
and
I
know
a
'
spectable
old
gentleman
as
lives
there
,
wot'll
give
you
lodgings
for
nothink
,
and
never
ask
for
the
change
---
that
is
,
if
any
genelman
he
knows
interduces
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
do
n't
he
know
me
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
!
   
<EOS>
Not
in
the
least
!
 
<EOS>
By
no
means
.
 
<EOS>
Certainly
not
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
young
gentelman
smiled
,
as
if
to
intimate
that
the
latter
fragments
of
discourse
were
playfully
ironical
;
and
finished
the
beer
as
he
did
so
.
   
<EOS>
This
unexpected
offer
of
shelter
was
too
tempting
to
be
resisted
;
especially
as
it
was
immediately
followed
up
,
by
the
assurance
that
the
old
gentleman
referred
to
,
would
doubtless
provide
Oliver
with
a
comfortable
place
,
without
loss
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
This
led
to
a
more
friendly
and
confidential
dialogue
;
from
which
Oliver
discovered
that
his
friend
's
name
was
Jack
Dawkins
,
and
that
he
was
a
peculiar
pet
and
protege
of
the
elderly
gentleman
before
mentioned
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dawkin
's
appearance
did
not
say
a
vast
deal
in
favour
of
the
comforts
which
his
patron
's
interest
obtained
for
those
whom
he
took
under
his
protection
;
but
,
as
he
had
a
rather
flightly
and
dissolute
mode
of
conversing
,
and
furthermore
avowed
that
among
his
intimate
friends
he
was
better
known
by
the
sobriquet
of
"
The
Artful
Dodger
,
"
<EOS>
Oliver
concluded
that
,
being
of
a
dissipated
and
careless
turn
,
the
moral
precepts
of
his
benefactor
had
hitherto
been
thrown
away
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
Under
this
impression
,
he
secretly
resolved
to
cultivate
the
good
opinion
of
the
old
gentleman
as
quickly
as
possible
;
and
,
if
he
found
the
Dodger
incorrigible
,
as
he
more
than
half
suspected
he
should
,
to
decline
the
honour
of
his
farther
acquaintance
.
   
<EOS>
As
John
Dawkins
objected
to
their
entering
London
before
nightfall
,
it
was
nearly
eleven
o'clock
when
they
reached
the
turnpike
at
Islington
.
 
<EOS>
They
crossed
from
the
Angel
into
St
John
's
Road
;
struck
down
the
small
street
which
terminates
at
Sadler
's
Wells
Theatre
;
through
Exmouth
Street
and
Coppice
Row
;
down
the
little
court
by
the
side
of
the
workhouse
;
across
the
classic
ground
which
once
bore
the
name
of
Hockley
-
in
-
the
-
Hole
;
thence
into
Little
Saffron
Hill
;
and
so
into
Saffron
Hill
the
Great
:
 
along
which
the
Dodger
scudded
at
a
rapid
pace
,
directing
Oliver
to
follow
close
at
his
heels
.
   
<EOS>
Although
Oliver
had
enough
to
occupy
his
attention
in
keeping
sight
of
his
leader
,
he
could
not
help
bestowing
a
few
hasty
glances
on
either
side
of
the
way
,
as
he
passed
along
.
 
<EOS>
A
dirtier
or
more
wretched
place
he
had
never
seen
.
 
<EOS>
The
street
was
very
narrow
and
muddy
,
and
the
air
was
impregnated
with
filthy
odours
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
a
good
many
small
shops
;
but
the
only
stock
in
trade
appeared
to
be
heaps
of
children
,
who
,
even
at
that
time
of
night
,
were
crawling
in
and
out
at
the
doors
,
or
screaming
from
the
inside
.
 
<EOS>
The
sole
places
that
seemed
to
prosper
amid
the
general
blight
of
the
place
,
were
the
public
-
houses
;
and
in
them
,
the
lowest
orders
of
Irish
were
wrangling
with
might
and
main
.
<EOS>
Covered
ways
and
yards
,
which
here
and
there
diverged
from
the
main
street
,
disclosed
little
knots
of
houses
,
where
drunken
men
and
women
were
positively
wallowing
in
filth
;
and
from
several
of
the
door
-
ways
,
great
ill
-
looking
fellows
were
cautiously
emerging
,
bound
,
to
all
appearance
,
on
no
very
well
-
disposed
or
harmless
errands
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
was
just
considering
whether
he
had
n't
better
run
away
,
when
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
His
conductor
,
catching
him
by
the
arm
,
pushed
open
the
door
of
a
house
near
Field
Lane
;
and
drawing
him
into
the
passage
,
closed
it
behind
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
then
!
"
cried
a
voice
from
below
,
in
reply
to
a
whistle
from
the
Dodger
.
   
<EOS>
"
Plummy
and
slam
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
reply
.
   
<EOS>
This
seemed
to
be
some
watchword
or
signal
that
all
was
right
;
for
the
light
of
a
feeble
candle
gleamed
on
the
wall
at
the
remote
end
of
the
passage
;
and
a
man
's
face
peeped
out
,
from
where
a
balustrade
of
the
old
kitchen
staircase
had
been
broken
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
two
on
you
,
"
said
the
man
,
thrusting
the
candle
farther
out
,
and
shielding
his
eyes
with
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
's
the
t'other
one
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
new
pal
,
"
replied
Jack
Dawkins
,
pulling
Oliver
forward
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
did
he
come
from
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Greenland
.
 
<EOS>
Is
Fagin
upstairs
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
's
a
sortin
'
the
wipes
.
 
<EOS>
Up
with
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
candle
was
drawn
back
,
and
the
face
disappeared
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
,
groping
his
way
with
one
hand
,
and
having
the
other
firmly
grasped
by
his
companion
,
ascended
with
much
difficulty
the
dark
and
broken
stairs
:
 
<EOS>
which
his
conductor
mounted
with
an
ease
and
expedition
that
showed
he
was
well
acquainted
with
them
.
   
<EOS>
He
threw
open
the
door
of
a
back
-
room
,
and
drew
Oliver
in
after
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
walls
and
ceiling
of
the
room
were
perfectly
black
with
age
and
dirt
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
deal
table
before
the
fire
:
 
upon
which
were
a
candle
,
stuck
in
a
ginger
-
beer
bottle
,
two
or
three
pewter
pots
,
a
loaf
and
butter
,
and
a
plate
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
frying
-
pan
,
which
was
on
the
fire
,
and
which
was
secured
to
the
mantelshelf
by
a
string
,
some
sausages
were
cooking
;
and
standing
over
them
,
with
a
toasting
-
fork
in
his
hand
,
was
a
very
old
shrivelled
Jew
,
whose
villainous
-
looking
and
repulsive
face
was
obscured
by
a
quantity
of
matted
red
hair
.
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
a
greasy
flannel
gown
,
with
his
throat
bare
;
and
seemed
to
be
dividing
his
attention
between
the
frying
-
pan
and
the
clothes
-
horse
,
over
which
a
great
number
of
silk
handkerchiefsl
were
hanging
.
 
<EOS>
Several
rough
beds
made
of
old
sacks
,
were
huddled
side
by
side
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Seated
round
the
table
were
four
or
five
boys
,
none
older
than
the
Dodger
,
smoking
long
clay
pipes
,
and
drinking
spirits
with
the
air
of
middle
-
aged
men
.
 
<EOS>
These
all
crowded
about
their
associate
as
he
whispered
a
few
words
to
the
Jew
;
and
then
turned
round
and
grinned
at
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
So
did
the
Jew
himself
,
toasting
-
fork
in
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
him
,
Fagin
,
"
said
Jack
Dawkins
;
"
my
friend
Oliver
Twist
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
grinned
;
and
,
making
a
low
obeisance
to
Oliver
,
took
him
by
the
hand
,
and
hoped
he
should
have
the
honour
of
his
intimate
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
young
gentleman
with
the
pipes
came
round
him
,
and
shook
both
his
hands
very
hard
---
especially
the
one
in
which
he
held
his
little
bundle
.
 
<EOS>
One
young
gentleman
was
very
anxious
to
hang
up
his
cap
for
him
;
and
another
was
so
obliging
as
to
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
in
order
that
,
as
he
was
very
tired
,
he
might
not
have
the
trouble
of
emptying
them
,
himself
,
when
he
went
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
These
civilities
would
probably
be
extended
much
farther
,
but
for
a
liberal
exercise
of
the
Jew
's
toasting
-
fork
on
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
the
affectionate
youths
who
offered
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
very
glad
to
see
you
,
Oliver
,
very
,
"
said
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dodger
,
take
off
the
sausages
;
and
draw
a
tub
near
the
fire
for
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
you
're
a
-
staring
at
the
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
!
<EOS>
eh
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
a
good
many
of
'em
,
ai
n't
there
?
<EOS>
We
've
just
looked
'em
out
,
ready
for
the
wash
;
that
's
all
,
Oliver
;
that
's
all
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
latter
part
of
this
speech
,
was
hailed
by
a
boisterous
shout
from
all
the
hopeful
pupils
of
the
merry
old
gentleman
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
which
they
went
to
supper
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
ate
his
share
,
and
the
Jew
then
mixed
him
a
glass
of
hot
gin
-
and
-
water
:
 
<EOS>
telling
him
he
must
drink
it
off
directly
,
because
another
gentleman
wanted
the
tumbler
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
did
as
he
was
desired
.
 
<EOS>
Immediately
afterwards
he
felt
himself
gently
lifted
on
to
one
of
the
sacks
;
and
then
he
sunk
into
a
deep
sleep
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
9
.
<EOS>
Containing
further
particulars
concerning
the
pleasant
old
gentleman
,
and
his
hopeful
pupils
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
late
next
morning
when
Oliver
awoke
,
from
a
sound
,
long
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
other
person
in
the
room
but
the
old
Jew
,
who
was
boiling
some
coffee
in
a
saucepan
for
breakfast
,
and
whistling
softly
to
himself
as
he
stirred
it
round
and
round
,
with
an
iron
spoon
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
stop
every
now
and
then
to
listen
when
there
was
the
least
noise
below
:
and
when
he
had
satistified
himself
,
he
would
go
on
whistling
and
stirring
again
,
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
Although
Oliver
had
roused
himself
from
sleep
,
he
was
not
thoroughly
awake
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
drowsy
state
,
between
sleeping
and
waking
,
when
you
dream
more
in
five
minutes
with
your
eyes
half
open
,
and
yourself
half
conscious
of
everything
that
is
passing
around
you
,
than
you
would
in
five
nights
with
your
eyes
fast
closed
,
and
your
senses
wrapt
in
perfect
unconsciousness
.
 
<EOS>
At
such
time
,
a
mortal
knows
just
enough
of
what
his
mind
is
doing
,
to
form
some
glimmering
conception
of
its
mighty
powers
,
its
bounding
from
earth
and
spurning
time
and
space
,
when
freed
from
the
restraint
of
its
corporeal
associate
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
was
precisely
in
this
condition
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
the
Jew
with
his
half
-
closed
eyes
;
heard
his
low
whistling
;
and
recognised
the
sound
of
the
spoon
grating
against
the
saucepan
's
sides
:
 
and
yet
the
self
-
same
senses
were
mentally
engaged
,
at
the
same
time
,
in
busy
action
with
almost
everybody
he
had
ever
known
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
coffee
was
done
,
the
Jew
drew
the
saucepan
to
the
hob
.
<EOS>
Standing
,
then
in
an
irresolute
attitude
for
a
few
minutes
,
as
if
he
did
not
well
know
how
to
employ
himself
,
he
turned
round
and
looked
at
Oliver
,
and
called
him
by
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
answer
,
and
was
to
all
appearances
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
After
satisfiying
himself
upon
this
head
,
the
Jew
stepped
gently
to
the
door
:
 
which
he
fastened
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
drew
forth
:
 
as
it
seemed
to
Oliver
,
from
some
trap
in
the
floor
:
 
a
small
box
,
which
he
placed
carefully
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
His
eyes
glistened
as
he
raised
the
lid
,
and
looked
in
.
 
<EOS>
Dragging
an
old
chair
to
the
table
,
he
sat
down
;
and
took
from
it
a
magnificent
gold
watch
,
sparkling
with
jewels
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
said
the
Jew
,
shrugging
up
his
shoulders
,
and
distorting
every
feature
with
a
hideous
grin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Clever
dogs
!
 
<EOS>
Clever
dogs
!
<EOS>
Staunch
to
the
last
!
 
<EOS>
Never
told
the
old
parson
where
they
were
.
<EOS>
Never
poached
upon
old
Fagin
!
 
<EOS>
And
why
should
they
?
 
<EOS>
It
would
n't
have
loosened
the
knot
,
or
kept
the
drop
up
,
a
minute
longer
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
Fine
fellows
!
 
<EOS>
Fine
fellows
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
,
and
other
muttered
reflections
of
the
like
nature
,
the
Jew
once
more
deposited
the
watch
in
its
place
of
safety
.
 
<EOS>
At
least
half
a
dozen
more
were
severally
drawn
forth
from
the
same
box
,
and
surveyed
with
equal
pleasure
;
besides
rings
,
brooches
,
bracelet
,
and
other
articles
of
jewellery
,
of
such
magnificent
materials
,
and
costly
workmanship
,
that
Oliver
had
no
idea
,
even
of
their
names
.
   
<EOS>
Having
replaced
these
trinkets
,
the
Jew
took
out
another
:
 
so
small
that
it
lay
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
There
seemed
to
be
some
very
minute
inscription
on
it
;
for
the
Jew
laid
it
flat
upon
the
table
,
and
shading
it
with
his
hand
,
pored
over
it
,
long
and
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
put
it
down
,
as
if
despairing
of
success
;
and
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
muttered
:
   
"
What
a
fine
thing
capital
punishment
is
!
 
<EOS>
Dead
men
never
repent
;
dead
men
never
bring
awkward
stories
to
light
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
it
's
a
fine
thing
for
the
trade
!
 
<EOS>
Five
of
'em
strung
up
in
a
row
,
and
none
left
to
play
booty
,
or
turn
white
-
livered
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
Jew
uttered
these
words
,
his
bright
dark
eyes
,
which
had
been
staring
vacantly
before
him
,
fell
on
Oliver
's
face
;
the
boy
's
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
in
mute
curiousity
;
and
although
the
recognition
was
only
for
an
instant
---
for
the
briefest
space
of
time
that
can
possibly
be
conceived
---
it
was
enough
to
show
the
old
man
that
he
had
been
observed
.
   
<EOS>
He
closed
the
lid
of
the
box
with
a
loud
crash
;
and
,
laying
his
hand
on
a
bread
knife
which
was
on
the
table
,
started
furiously
up
.
 
<EOS>
He
trembled
very
much
though
;
for
,
even
in
his
terror
,
Oliver
could
see
that
the
knife
quivered
in
the
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
said
the
Jew
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
watch
me
for
?
 
<EOS>
Why
are
you
awake
?
 
<EOS>
What
have
you
seen
?
 
<EOS>
Speak
out
,
boy
!
<EOS>
Quick
---
quick
!
<EOS>
for
your
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
n't
able
to
sleep
any
longer
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
,
meekly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
if
I
have
disturbed
you
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
were
not
awake
an
hour
ago
?
"
said
the
Jew
,
scowling
fiercely
on
the
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
!
"
replied
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
Jew
:
 
with
a
still
fiercer
look
than
before
:
 
and
a
threatening
attitude
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
I
was
not
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
,
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
,
indeed
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tush
,
tush
,
my
dear
!
"
said
the
Jew
,
abruptly
resuming
his
old
manner
,
and
playing
with
the
knife
a
little
,
before
he
laid
it
down
;
as
if
to
induce
the
belief
that
he
had
caught
it
up
,
in
mere
sport
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
know
that
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
tried
to
frighten
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
brave
boy
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
you
're
a
brave
boy
,
Oliver
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
Jew
rubbed
his
hands
with
a
chuckle
,
but
glanced
uneasily
at
the
box
,
notwithstanding
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
see
any
of
these
pretty
things
,
my
dear
?
"
said
the
Jew
,
laying
his
hand
upon
it
after
a
short
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
Jew
,
turning
rather
pale
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
---
they
're
mine
,
Oliver
;
my
little
property
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
have
to
live
upon
,
in
my
old
age
.
 
<EOS>
The
folks
call
me
a
miser
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Only
a
miser
;
that
's
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
thought
the
old
gentleman
must
be
a
decided
miser
to
live
in
such
a
dirty
place
,
with
so
many
watches
;
but
,
thinking
that
perhaps
his
fondness
for
the
Dodger
and
the
other
boys
,
cost
him
a
good
deal
of
money
,
he
only
cast
a
deferential
look
at
the
Jew
,
and
asked
if
he
might
get
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
my
dear
,
certainly
,
"
replied
the
old
gentleman
.
"
<EOS>
Stay
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
pitcher
of
water
in
the
corner
by
the
door
.
<EOS>
Bring
it
here
;
and
I
'll
give
you
a
basin
to
wash
in
,
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
got
up
;
walked
across
the
room
;
and
stooped
for
an
instant
to
raise
the
pitcher
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
turned
his
head
,
the
box
was
gone
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
washed
himself
,
and
made
everything
tidy
,
by
emptying
the
basin
out
of
the
window
,
agreeably
to
the
Jew
's
directions
,
when
the
Dodger
returned
:
 
accompanied
by
a
very
sprightly
young
friend
,
whom
Oliver
had
seen
smoking
on
the
previous
night
,
and
who
was
now
formally
introduced
to
him
as
Charley
Bates
.
 
<EOS>
The
four
sat
down
,
to
breakfast
,
on
the
coffee
,
and
some
hot
rolls
and
ham
which
the
Dodger
had
brought
home
in
the
crown
of
his
hat
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
glancing
slyly
at
Oliver
,
and
addressing
himself
to
the
Dodger
,
"
I
hope
you
've
been
at
work
this
morning
,
my
dears
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hard
,
"
replied
the
Dodger
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
nails
,
"
added
Charley
Bates
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
boys
,
good
boys
!
"
said
the
Jew
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
got
,
Dodger
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
couple
of
pocket
-
books
,
"
replied
that
young
gentlman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lined
?
"
inquired
the
Jew
,
with
eagerness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
,
"
replied
the
Dodger
,
producing
two
pocket
-
books
;
one
green
,
and
the
other
red
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
so
heavy
as
they
might
be
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
after
looking
at
the
insides
carefully
;
"
but
very
neat
and
nicely
made
.
 
<EOS>
Ingenious
workman
,
ai
n't
he
,
Oliver
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
indeed
,
sir
,
"
said
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
At
which
Mr
Charles
Bates
laughed
uproariously
;
very
much
to
the
amazement
of
Oliver
,
who
saw
nothing
to
laugh
at
,
in
anything
that
had
passed
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
have
you
got
,
my
dear
?
"
said
Fagin
to
Charley
Bates
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wipes
,
"
replied
Master
Bates
;
at
the
same
time
producing
four
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
inspecting
them
closely
;
"
they
're
very
good
ones
,
very
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
n't
marked
them
well
,
though
,
Charley
;
so
the
marks
shall
be
picked
out
with
a
needle
,
and
we
'll
teach
Oliver
how
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
us
,
Oliver
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
sir
,
"
said
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'd
like
to
be
able
to
make
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
as
easy
as
Charley
Bates
,
would
n't
you
,
my
dear
?
"
said
the
Jew
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
much
,
indeed
,
if
you
'll
teach
me
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
Master
Bates
saw
something
so
exquisitely
ludicrous
in
this
reply
,
that
he
burst
into
another
laugh
;
which
laugh
,
meeting
the
coffee
he
was
drinking
,
and
carrying
it
down
some
wrong
channel
,
very
nearly
terminated
in
his
premature
suffocation
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
so
jolly
green
!
"
said
Charley
when
he
recovered
,
as
an
apology
to
the
company
for
his
unpolite
behaviour
.
   
<EOS>
The
Dodger
said
nothing
,
but
he
smoothed
Oliver
's
hair
over
his
eyes
,
and
said
he
'd
know
better
,
by
and
by
;
upon
which
the
old
gentleman
,
observing
Oliver
's
colour
mounting
,
changed
the
subject
by
asking
whether
there
had
been
much
of
a
crowd
at
the
execution
that
morning
?
 
<EOS>
This
made
him
wonder
more
and
more
;
for
it
was
plain
from
the
replies
of
the
two
boys
that
they
had
both
been
there
;
and
Oliver
naturally
wondered
how
they
could
possibly
have
found
time
to
be
so
very
industrious
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
breakfast
was
cleared
away
;
the
merry
old
gentlman
and
the
two
boys
played
at
a
very
curious
and
uncommon
game
,
which
was
performed
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
The
merry
old
gentleman
,
placing
a
snuff
-
box
in
one
pocket
of
his
trousers
,
a
note
-
case
in
the
other
,
and
a
watch
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
with
a
guard
-
chain
round
his
neck
,
and
sticking
a
mock
diamond
pin
in
his
shirt
<EOS>
:
buttoned
his
coat
tight
round
him
,
and
putting
his
spectacle
-
case
and
handkerchief
in
his
pockets
,
trotted
up
and
down
the
room
with
a
stick
,
in
imitation
of
the
manner
in
which
old
gentlmen
walk
about
the
streets
any
hour
in
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
stopped
at
the
fire
-
place
,
and
sometimes
at
the
door
,
making
believe
that
he
was
staring
with
all
his
might
into
shop
-
windows
.
 
<EOS>
At
such
times
,
he
would
look
constantly
round
him
,
for
fear
of
thieves
,
and
would
keep
slapping
all
his
pockets
in
turn
,
to
see
that
he
had
n't
lost
anything
,
in
such
a
very
funny
and
natural
manner
,
that
Oliver
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
the
two
boys
followed
him
closely
about
:
 
getting
out
of
his
sight
,
so
nimbly
,
every
time
he
turned
round
,
that
it
was
impossible
to
follow
their
motions
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
the
Dodger
trod
upon
his
toes
,
or
ran
upon
his
boot
accidentally
,
while
Charley
Bates
stumbled
up
against
him
behind
;
and
in
that
one
moment
they
took
from
him
,
with
the
most
extraordinary
rapidity
,
snuff
-
box
,
note
-
case
,
watch
-
guard
,
chain
,
shirt
-
pin
,
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
even
the
spectacle
-
case
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
old
gentlman
felt
a
hand
in
any
one
of
his
pockets
,
he
cried
out
where
it
was
;
and
then
the
game
began
all
over
again
.
   
<EOS>
When
this
game
had
been
played
a
great
many
times
,
a
couple
of
young
ladies
called
to
see
the
young
gentleman
;
one
of
whom
was
named
Bet
,
and
the
other
Nancy
.
 
<EOS>
They
wore
a
good
deal
of
hair
,
not
very
neatly
turned
up
behind
,
and
were
rather
untidy
about
the
shoes
and
stockings
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
not
exactly
pretty
,
perhaps
;
but
they
had
a
great
deal
of
colour
in
their
faces
,
and
looked
quite
stout
and
hearty
.
 
<EOS>
Being
remarkably
free
and
agreeable
in
their
manners
<EOS>
,
Oliver
thought
them
very
nice
girls
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
As
there
is
no
doubt
they
were
.
   
<EOS>
The
visitors
stopped
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
Spirits
were
produced
,
in
consequence
of
one
of
the
young
ladies
complaining
of
a
coldness
in
her
inside
;
and
the
conversation
took
a
very
convivial
and
improving
turn
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
Charley
Bates
expressed
his
opinion
that
it
was
time
to
pad
the
hoof
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
it
occurred
to
Oliver
,
must
be
French
for
going
out
;
for
directly
afterwards
,
the
Dodger
,
and
Charley
,
and
the
two
young
ladies
,
went
away
together
,
having
been
kindly
furnished
by
the
amiable
old
Jew
with
money
to
spend
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
pleasant
life
,
is
n't
it
?
   
<EOS>
They
have
gone
out
for
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
they
done
work
,
sir
?
"
inquired
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
Jew
;
<EOS>
"
that
is
,
unless
they
should
unexpectedly
come
across
any
,
when
they
are
out
;
and
they
wo
n't
neglect
it
,
if
they
do
,
my
dear
,
depend
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Make
'em
your
models
,
my
dear
.
   
<EOS>
Make
'em
your
models
,
"
tapping
the
fire
-
shovel
on
the
hearth
to
add
force
to
his
words
;
"
do
everything
they
bid
you
,
and
take
their
advice
in
all
matters
---
especially
the
Dodger
's
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
He
'll
be
a
great
man
himself
,
and
will
make
you
one
too
,
if
you
take
pattern
by
him
.
<EOS>
---
Is
my
handkerchief
hanging
out
of
my
pocket
,
my
dear
?
"
said
the
Jew
,
stopping
short
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
said
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
See
if
you
can
take
it
out
,
without
my
feeling
it
;
as
you
saw
them
do
,
when
we
were
at
play
this
morning
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
held
up
the
bottom
of
the
pocket
with
one
hand
,
as
he
had
seen
the
Dodger
hold
it
,
and
drew
the
handkerchief
lighty
out
of
it
with
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
gone
?
"
cried
the
Jew
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
it
is
,
sir
,
"
said
Oliver
,
showing
it
in
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
clever
boy
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
playful
old
gentleman
,
patting
Oliver
on
the
head
approvingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
a
sharper
lad
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
a
shilling
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
go
on
,
in
this
way
,
you
'll
be
the
greatest
man
of
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
come
here
,
and
I
'll
show
you
how
to
take
the
marks
out
of
the
handkerchiefs
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
wondered
what
picking
the
old
gentleman
's
pocket
in
play
,
had
to
do
with
his
chances
of
being
a
great
man
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
thinking
that
the
Jew
,
being
so
much
his
senior
,
must
know
best
,
he
followed
him
quietly
to
the
table
,
and
was
soon
deeply
involved
in
his
new
study
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
10
.
<EOS>
Oliver
becomes
better
acquainted
with
the
characters
of
his
new
associates
;
and
purchases
experience
at
a
high
price
.
<EOS>
Being
a
short
,
but
very
important
chapter
,
in
this
history
.
 
<EOS>
For
many
days
,
Oliver
remained
in
the
Jew
's
room
,
picking
the
marks
out
of
the
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
(
of
which
a
great
number
were
brought
home
,
)
and
sometimes
taking
part
in
the
game
already
described
:
 
which
the
two
boys
and
the
Jew
played
,
regularly
,
every
morning
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
he
began
to
languish
for
fresh
air
,
and
took
many
occasions
of
earnestly
entreating
the
old
gentleman
to
allow
him
to
go
out
to
work
with
his
two
companions
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
was
rendered
the
more
anxious
to
be
actively
employed
,
by
what
he
had
seen
of
the
stern
morality
of
the
old
gentleman
's
character
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
the
Dodger
or
Charley
Bates
came
home
at
night
,
empty
-
handed
,
he
would
expatiate
with
great
vehemence
on
the
misery
of
idle
and
lazy
habits
;
and
would
enforce
upon
them
the
necessity
of
an
active
life
,
by
sending
them
supperless
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
On
one
occasion
,
indeed
,
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
knock
them
both
down
a
flight
of
stairs
;
but
this
was
carrying
out
his
virtuous
precepts
to
an
unusual
extent
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
,
one
morning
,
Oliver
obtained
the
permission
he
had
so
eagerly
sought
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
been
no
handkerchiefs
to
work
upon
,
for
two
or
three
days
,
and
the
dinners
had
been
rather
meagre
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
these
were
reasons
for
the
old
gentleman
's
giving
his
assent
;
but
,
whether
they
were
or
no
,
he
told
Oliver
he
might
go
,
and
placed
him
under
the
joint
guardianship
of
Charley
Bates
,
and
his
friend
the
Dodger
.
   
<EOS>
The
three
boys
sallied
out
;
the
Dodger
with
his
coat
-
sleeves
tucked
up
,
and
his
hat
cocked
,
as
usual
;
Master
Bates
sauntering
along
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
;
and
Oliver
between
them
,
wondering
where
they
were
going
,
and
what
branch
of
manufacture
he
would
be
instructed
in
,
first
.
   
<EOS>
The
pace
at
which
they
went
,
was
such
a
very
lazy
,
ill
-
looking
saunter
,
that
Oliver
soon
began
to
think
his
companions
were
going
to
deceive
the
old
gentleman
,
by
not
going
to
work
at
all
.
<EOS>
The
Dodger
had
a
vicious
propensity
,
too
,
of
pulling
the
caps
from
the
heads
of
small
boys
and
tossing
them
down
areas
;
while
Charley
Bates
exhibited
some
very
loose
notions
concerning
the
rights
of
property
,
by
pilfering
divers
apples
and
onions
from
the
stalls
at
the
kennel
sides
,
and
thrusting
them
into
pockets
which
were
so
surprisingly
capacious
,
that
they
seemed
to
undermine
his
whole
suit
of
clothes
in
every
direction
.
 
<EOS>
These
things
looked
so
bad
,
that
Oliver
was
on
the
point
of
declaring
his
intention
of
seeking
his
way
back
,
in
the
best
way
he
could
;
when
his
thoughts
were
suddenly
directed
into
another
channel
,
by
a
very
mysterious
change
of
behaviour
on
the
part
of
the
Dodger
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
just
emerging
from
a
narrow
court
not
far
from
the
open
square
in
Clerkenwell
,
which
is
yet
called
,
by
some
strange
perversion
of
terms
,
"
The
Green
"
:
 
when
the
Dodger
made
a
sudden
stop
;
and
,
laying
his
finger
on
his
lip
,
drew
his
companions
back
again
,
with
the
greatest
caution
and
circumspection
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
demanded
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
replied
the
Dodger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
see
that
old
cove
at
the
book
-
stall
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
old
gentleman
over
the
way
?
<EOS>
"
said
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
see
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
'll
do
,
"
said
the
Doger
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
prime
plant
,
"
observed
Master
Charley
Bates
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
looked
from
one
to
the
other
,
with
the
greatest
surprise
;
but
he
was
not
permitted
to
make
any
inquiries
;
for
the
two
boys
walked
stealthily
across
the
road
,
and
slunk
close
behind
the
old
gentleman
towards
whom
his
attention
had
been
directed
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
walked
a
few
paces
after
them
;
and
,
not
knowing
whether
to
advance
or
retire
,
stood
looking
on
in
silent
amazement
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
was
a
very
respectable
-
looking
personage
,
with
a
powdered
head
and
gold
spectacles
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
a
bottle
-
green
coat
with
a
black
velvet
collar
;
wore
white
trousers
;
and
carried
a
smart
bamboo
cane
under
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
taken
up
a
book
from
the
stall
,
and
there
he
stood
,
reading
away
,
as
hard
as
if
he
were
in
his
elbow
-
chair
,
in
his
own
study
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
possible
that
he
fancied
himself
there
,
indeed
;
for
it
was
plain
,
from
his
abstraction
,
that
he
saw
not
the
book
-
stall
,
nor
the
street
,
nor
the
boys
,
nor
,
in
short
,
anything
but
the
book
itself
:
 
which
he
was
reading
straight
through
:
 
turning
over
the
leaf
when
he
got
to
the
bottom
of
a
page
,
beginning
at
the
top
line
of
the
next
one
,
and
going
regularly
on
,
with
the
greatest
interest
and
eagerness
.
   
<EOS>
What
was
Oliver
's
horror
and
alarm
as
he
stood
a
few
paces
off
,
looking
on
with
his
eyelids
as
wide
open
as
they
would
possibly
go
,
to
see
the
Dodger
plunge
his
hand
into
the
old
gentleman
's
pocket
,
and
draw
from
thence
a
handkerchief
!
 
<EOS>
To
see
him
hand
the
same
to
Charley
Bates
;
and
finally
to
behold
them
,
both
running
away
round
the
corner
at
full
speed
!
   
<EOS>
In
an
instant
the
whole
mystery
of
the
hankerchiefs
,
and
the
watches
,
and
the
jewels
,
and
the
Jew
,
rushed
upon
the
boy
's
mind
.
   
<EOS>
He
stood
,
for
a
moment
,
with
the
blood
so
tingling
through
all
his
veins
from
terror
,
that
he
felt
as
if
he
were
in
a
burning
fire
;
then
,
confused
and
frightened
,
he
took
to
his
heels
;
and
,
not
knowing
what
he
did
,
made
off
as
fast
as
he
could
lay
his
feet
to
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
all
done
in
a
minute
's
space
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
very
instant
when
Oliver
began
to
run
,
the
old
gentleman
,
putting
his
hand
to
his
pocket
,
and
missing
his
handkerchief
,
turned
sharp
round
.
 
<EOS>
Seeing
the
boy
scudding
away
at
such
a
rapid
pace
,
he
very
naturally
concluded
him
to
be
the
depredator
;
and
shouting
"
Stop
thief
!
"
<EOS>
with
all
his
might
,
made
off
after
him
,
book
in
hand
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
old
gentleman
was
not
the
only
person
who
raised
the
hue
-
and
-
cry
.
 
<EOS>
The
Dodger
and
Master
Bates
,
unwilling
to
attract
public
attention
by
running
down
the
open
street
,
had
merely
retured
into
the
very
first
doorway
round
the
corner
.
<EOS>
They
no
sooner
heard
the
cry
,
and
saw
Oliver
running
,
than
,
guessing
exactly
how
the
matter
stood
,
they
issued
forth
with
great
promptitude
;
and
,
shouting
"
Stop
thief
!
"
<EOS>
too
,
joined
in
the
pursuit
like
good
citizens
.
   
<EOS>
Although
Oliver
had
been
brought
up
by
philosophers
,
he
was
not
theoretically
acquainted
with
the
beautiful
axiom
<EOS>
that
self
-
preservation
is
the
first
law
of
nature
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
been
,
perhaps
he
would
have
been
prepared
for
this
.
 
<EOS>
Not
being
prepared
,
however
,
it
alarmed
him
the
more
;
so
away
he
went
like
the
wind
,
with
the
old
gentleman
and
the
two
boys
roaring
and
shouting
behind
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
thief
!
 
<EOS>
Stop
thief
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
magic
in
the
sound
.
<EOS>
The
tradesman
leaves
his
counter
,
and
the
car
-
man
his
waggon
;
the
butcher
throws
down
his
tray
;
the
baker
his
basket
;
the
milkman
his
pail
;
the
errand
-
boy
his
parcels
;
the
school
-
boy
his
marbles
;
the
paviour
his
pickaxe
;
the
child
his
battledore
.
 
<EOS>
Away
they
run
,
pell
-
mell
,
helter
-
skelter
,
<EOS>
slap
-
dash
:
 
<EOS>
tearing
,
yelling
,
screaming
,
knocking
down
the
passengers
as
they
turn
the
corners
,
rousing
up
the
dogs
,
and
astonishing
the
fowls
:
 
and
streets
,
squares
,
and
courts
,
re
-
echo
with
the
sound
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
thief
!
 
<EOS>
Stop
thief
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
cry
is
taken
up
by
a
hundred
voices
,
and
the
crowd
accumulate
at
every
turning
.
 
<EOS>
Away
they
fly
,
splashing
through
the
mud
,
and
rattling
along
the
pavements
:
   
up
<EOS>
go
the
windows
,
out
run
the
people
,
onward
bear
the
mob
,
a
whole
audience
desert
Punch
in
the
very
thickest
of
the
plot
,
and
,
joining
the
rushing
throng
,
swell
the
shout
,
and
lend
fresh
vigour
to
the
cry
,
"
Stop
thief
!
<EOS>
Stop
thief
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
thief
!
 
<EOS>
Stop
thief
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
passion
FOR
HUNTING
SOMETHING
deeply
implanted
in
the
human
breast
.
 
<EOS>
One
wretched
breathless
child
,
panting
with
exhaustion
;
terror
in
his
looks
;
agaony
in
his
eyes
;
large
drops
of
perspiration
streaming
down
his
face
;
strains
every
nerve
to
make
head
upon
his
pursuers
;
and
as
they
follow
on
his
track
,
and
gain
upon
him
every
instant
,
they
hail
his
decreasing
strength
with
joy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
thief
!
"
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
stop
him
for
God
's
sake
,
were
it
only
in
mercy
!
   
<EOS>
Stopped
at
last
!
 
<EOS>
A
clever
blow
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
down
upon
the
pavement
;
and
the
crowd
eagerly
gather
round
him
:
 
each
new
comer
,
jostling
and
struggling
with
the
others
to
catch
a
glimpse
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stand
aside
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Give
him
a
little
air
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
he
do
n't
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
's
the
gentleman
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Here
his
is
,
coming
down
the
street
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Make
room
there
for
the
gentleman
!
"
<EOS>
"
Is
this
the
boy
,
sir
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
Oliver
lay
,
covered
with
mud
and
dust
,
and
bleeding
from
the
mouth
,
looking
wildly
round
upon
the
heap
of
faces
that
surrounded
him
,
when
the
old
gentleman
was
officiously
dragged
and
pushed
into
the
circle
by
the
foremost
of
the
pursuers
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
"
I
am
afraid
it
is
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Afraid
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
good
'
un
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
fellow
!
"
said
the
gentleman
,
"
he
has
hurt
himself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
\
<EOS>
I
\
did
that
,
sir
,
"
said
a
great
lubberly
fellow
,
stepping
forward
;
"
and
preciously
I
cut
my
knuckle
agin
'
his
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
I
stopped
him
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
follow
touched
his
hat
with
a
grin
,
expecting
something
for
his
pains
;
but
,
the
old
gentleman
,
eyeing
him
with
an
expression
of
dislike
,
look
anxiously
round
,
as
if
he
contemplated
running
away
himself
:
 
which
it
is
very
possible
he
might
have
attempted
to
do
,
and
thus
have
afforded
another
chase
,
had
not
a
police
officer
(
who
is
generally
the
last
person
to
arrive
in
such
cases
)
at
that
moment
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
,
and
seized
Oliver
by
the
collar
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
get
up
,
"
said
the
man
,
roughly
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
n't
me
indeed
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
indeed
,
it
was
two
other
boys
,
"
said
Oliver
,
clasping
his
hands
passionately
,
and
looking
round
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
here
somewhere
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
they
ai
n't
,
"
said
the
officer
.
 
<EOS>
He
meant
this
to
be
ironical
,
but
it
was
true
besides
;
for
the
Dodger
and
Charley
Bates
had
filed
off
down
the
first
convenient
court
they
came
to
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
get
up
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
hurt
him
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
compassionately
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
,
I
wo
n't
hurt
him
,
"
replied
the
officer
,
tearing
his
jacket
half
off
his
back
,
in
proof
thereof
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
I
know
you
;
it
wo
n't
do
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
stand
upon
your
legs
,
you
young
devil
?
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
,
who
could
hardly
stand
,
made
a
shift
to
raise
himself
on
his
feet
,
and
was
at
once
lugged
along
the
streets
by
the
jacket
-
collar
,
at
a
rapid
pace
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
walked
on
with
them
by
the
officer
's
side
;
and
as
many
of
the
crowd
as
could
achieve
the
feat
,
got
a
little
ahead
,
and
stared
back
at
Oliver
from
time
to
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
boys
shouted
in
triumph
;
and
on
they
went
.

Chapter
11
.
<EOS>
Treats
of
Mr
Fang
the
police
magistrate
;
and
furnishes
a
slight
specimen
of
his
mode
of
administering
justice
.
 
<EOS>
The
offence
had
been
committed
within
the
district
,
and
indeed
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
,
a
very
notorious
metropolitan
police
office
.
 
<EOS>
The
crowd
had
only
the
satisfaction
of
accompanying
Oliver
through
two
or
three
streets
,
and
down
a
place
called
Mutton
Hill
,
when
he
was
led
beneath
a
low
archway
,
and
up
a
dirty
court
,
into
this
dispensary
of
summary
justice
,
by
the
back
way
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
small
paved
yard
into
which
they
turned
;
and
here
they
encountered
a
stout
man
with
a
bunch
of
whiskers
on
his
face
,
and
a
bunch
of
keys
in
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
now
?
"
said
the
man
carelessly
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
young
fogle
-
hunter
,
"
replied
the
man
who
had
Oliver
in
charge
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
the
party
that
's
been
robbed
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
man
with
the
keys
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
,
"
replied
the
old
gentleman
;
"
but
I
am
not
sure
that
this
boy
actually
took
the
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
I
---
I
would
rather
not
press
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Must
go
before
the
magistrate
now
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
worship
will
be
disengaged
in
half
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
young
gallows
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
an
invitation
for
Oliver
to
enter
through
a
door
which
he
unlocked
as
he
spoke
,
and
which
led
into
a
stone
cell
.
 
<EOS>
Here
he
was
searched
;
and
nothing
being
found
upon
him
,
locked
up
.
   
<EOS>
This
cell
was
in
shape
and
size
something
like
an
area
cellar
,
only
not
so
light
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
most
intolerably
dirty
;
for
it
was
Monday
morning
;
and
it
had
been
tenanted
by
six
drunken
people
,
who
had
been
locked
up
,
elsewhere
,
since
Saturday
night
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
is
little
.
 
<EOS>
In
our
station
-
houses
,
men
and
women
are
every
night
confined
on
the
most
trivial
charges
---
the
word
is
worth
noting
---
in
dungeons
,
compared
with
which
,
those
in
Newgate
,
occupied
by
the
most
atrocious
felons
,
tried
,
found
guilty
,
and
under
sentence
of
death
,
are
palaces
.
<EOS>
Let
any
one
who
doubts
this
,
compare
the
two
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
looked
almost
as
rueful
as
Oliver
when
the
key
grated
in
the
lock
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
with
a
sigh
to
the
book
,
which
had
been
the
innocent
cause
of
all
this
disturbance
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
something
in
that
boy
's
face
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
to
himself
as
he
walked
slowly
away
,
tapping
his
chin
with
the
cover
of
the
book
,
in
a
thoughtful
manner
;
"
something
that
touches
and
interests
me
.
 
<EOS>
CAN
he
be
innocent
?
 
<EOS>
He
looked
like
---
<EOS>
Bye
the
bye
,
"
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
,
halting
very
abruptly
,
and
staring
up
into
the
sky
<EOS>
,
"
Bless
my
soul
!
<EOS>
---
where
have
I
seen
something
like
that
look
before
?
"
   
<EOS>
After
musing
for
some
minutes
,
the
old
gentleman
walked
,
with
the
same
meditative
face
,
into
a
back
anteroom
opening
from
the
yard
;
and
there
,
retiring
into
a
corner
,
called
up
before
his
mind
's
eye
a
vast
amphitheatre
of
faces
over
which
a
dusky
curtain
had
hung
for
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
shaking
his
head
;
"
it
must
be
imagination
.
   
<EOS>
He
wandered
over
them
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
called
them
into
view
,
and
it
was
not
easy
to
replace
the
shroud
that
had
so
long
concealed
them
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
the
faces
of
friends
,
and
foes
,
and
of
many
that
had
been
almost
strangers
peering
intrusively
from
the
crowd
;
there
were
the
faces
of
young
and
blooming
girls
that
were
now
old
women
;
there
were
faces
that
the
grave
had
changed
and
closed
upon
,
but
which
the
mind
,
superior
to
its
power
,
still
dressed
in
their
old
freshness
and
beauty
,
calling
back
the
lustre
of
the
eyes
,
the
brightness
of
the
smile
,
the
beaming
of
the
soul
through
its
mask
of
clay
,
and
whispering
of
beauty
beyond
the
tomb
,
changed
but
to
be
heightened
,
and
taken
from
earth
only
to
be
set
up
as
a
light
,
to
shed
a
soft
and
gentle
glow
upon
the
path
to
Heaven
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
old
gentleman
could
recall
no
one
countenance
of
which
Oliver
's
features
bore
a
trace
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
heaved
a
sigh
over
the
recollections
he
awakened
;
and
being
,
happily
for
himself
,
an
absent
old
gentleman
,
buried
them
again
in
the
pages
of
the
musty
book
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
roused
by
a
touch
on
the
shoulder
,
and
a
request
from
the
man
with
the
keys
to
follow
him
into
the
office
.
 
<EOS>
He
closed
his
book
hastily
;
and
was
at
once
ushered
into
the
imposing
presence
of
the
renowned
Mr
Fang
.
   
<EOS>
The
office
was
a
front
parlour
,
with
a
panelled
wall
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Fang
sat
behind
a
bar
,
at
the
upper
end
;
and
on
one
side
the
door
was
a
sort
of
wooden
pen
in
which
poor
little
Oliver
was
already
deposited
;
trembling
very
much
at
the
awfulness
of
the
scene
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Fang
was
a
lean
,
long
-
backed
,
stiff
-
necked
,
middle
-
sized
man
,
with
no
great
quantity
of
hair
,
and
what
he
had
,
growing
on
the
back
and
sides
of
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
was
stern
,
and
much
flushed
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
were
really
not
in
the
habit
of
drinking
rather
more
than
was
exactly
good
for
him
,
he
might
have
brought
action
against
his
countenance
for
libel
,
and
have
recovered
heavy
damages
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
bowed
respectfully
;
and
advancing
to
the
magistrate
's
desk
,
said
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
,
"
That
is
my
name
and
address
,
sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
withdrew
a
pace
or
two
;
and
,
with
another
polite
and
gentlemanly
inclination
of
the
head
,
waited
to
be
questioned
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
it
so
happened
that
Mr
Fang
was
at
that
moment
perusing
a
leading
article
in
a
newspaper
of
the
morning
,
adverting
to
some
recent
decision
of
his
,
and
commending
him
,
for
the
three
hundred
and
fiftieth
time
,
to
the
special
and
particular
notice
of
the
Secretary
of
State
for
the
Home
Department
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
out
of
temper
;
and
he
looked
up
with
an
angry
scowl
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
?
"
said
Mr
Fang
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
pointed
,
with
some
surprise
,
to
his
card
.
   
<EOS>
"
Officer
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Fang
,
tossing
the
card
contemptuously
away
with
the
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
this
fellow
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
name
,
sir
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
speaking
LIKE
a
gentleman
,
"
my
name
,
sir
,
is
Brownlow
.
 
<EOS>
Permit
me
to
inquire
the
name
of
the
magistrate
who
offers
a
gratuitous
and
unprovoked
insult
to
a
respectable
person
,
under
the
protection
of
the
bench
.
"
 
<EOS>
Saying
this
,
Mr
Brownlow
looked
around
the
office
as
if
in
search
of
some
person
who
would
afford
him
the
required
information
.
   
<EOS>
"
Officer
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Fang
,
throwing
the
paper
on
one
side
,
"
what
's
this
fellow
charged
with
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
not
charged
at
all
,
your
worship
,
"
replied
the
officer
.
"
<EOS>
He
appears
against
this
boy
,
your
worship
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
worshp
knew
this
perfectly
well
;
but
it
was
a
good
annoyance
,
and
a
safe
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
Appears
against
the
boy
,
does
he
?
"
said
Mr
Fang
,
surveying
Mr
Brownlow
contemptuously
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
Swear
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Before
I
am
sworn
,
I
must
beg
to
say
one
word
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
;
"
and
that
is
,
that
I
really
never
,
without
actual
experience
,
could
have
believed
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
Hold
your
tongue
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
said
Mr
Fang
,
peremptorily
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
,
sir
!
"
replied
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
this
instant
,
or
<EOS>
I
'll
have
you
turned
out
of
the
office
!
"
said
Mr
Fang
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
an
insolent
impertinent
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
How
dare
you
bully
a
magistrate
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
,
reddening
.
   
<EOS>
"
Swear
this
person
!
"
<EOS>
said
Fang
to
the
clerk
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
hear
another
word
.
 
<EOS>
Swear
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Brownlow
's
indignaton
was
greatly
roused
;
but
reflecting
perhaps
,
that
he
might
only
injure
the
boy
by
giving
vent
to
it
,
he
suppressed
his
feelings
and
submitted
to
be
sworn
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Fang
,
"
what
's
the
charge
against
this
boy
?
 
<EOS>
What
have
you
got
to
say
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
standing
at
a
bookstall
---
"
Mr
Brownlow
began
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Fang
.
 
<EOS>
"
Policeman
!
 
<EOS>
Where
's
the
policeman
?
 
<EOS>
Here
,
swear
this
policeman
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
policeman
,
what
is
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
policeman
,
with
becoming
humility
,
related
how
he
had
taken
the
charge
;
how
he
had
searched
Oliver
,
and
found
nothing
on
his
person
;
and
how
that
was
all
he
knew
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
there
any
witnesses
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Fang
.
   
<EOS>
"
None
,
your
worship
,
"
replied
the
policeman
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Fang
sat
silent
for
some
minutes
,
and
then
,
turning
round
to
the
prosecutor
,
said
in
a
towering
passion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
state
what
your
complaint
against
this
boy
is
,
man
,
or
do
you
not
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
been
sworn
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
if
you
stand
there
,
refusing
to
give
evidence
,
I
'll
punish
you
for
disrespect
to
the
bench
;
I
will
,
by
---
"
   
<EOS>
By
what
,
or
by
whom
,
nobody
knows
,
for
the
clerk
and
jailor
coughed
very
loud
,
just
at
the
right
moment
;
and
the
former
dropped
a
heavy
book
upon
the
floor
,
thus
preventing
the
word
from
being
heard
---
accidentally
,
of
course
.
   
<EOS>
With
many
interruptions
,
and
repeated
insults
,
Mr
Brownlow
contrived
to
state
his
case
;
 
observing
that
,
in
the
surprise
of
the
moment
,
he
had
run
after
the
boy
because
he
had
saw
him
running
away
;
and
expressing
his
hope
that
,
if
the
magistrate
should
believe
him
,
although
not
actually
the
thief
,
to
be
connected
with
the
thieves
,
he
would
deal
as
leniently
with
him
as
justice
would
allow
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
hurt
already
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
in
conclusion
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
fear
,
"
he
added
,
with
great
energy
,
looking
towards
the
bar
,
"
I
really
fear
that
he
is
ill
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
I
dare
say
!
"
said
Mr
Fang
,
with
a
sneer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
none
of
your
tricks
here
,
<EOS>
you
young
vagabond
;
they
wo
n't
do
.
<EOS>
What
's
your
name
?
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
tried
to
reply
but
his
tongue
failed
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
deadly
pale
;
and
the
whole
place
seemed
turning
round
and
round
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
your
name
,
you
hardened
scoundrel
?
"
demanded
Mr
Fang
.
<EOS>
"
Officer
,
what
's
his
name
?
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
addressed
to
a
bluff
old
fellow
,
in
a
striped
waistcoat
,
who
was
standing
by
the
bar
.
 
<EOS>
He
bent
over
Oliver
,
and
repeated
the
inquiry
;
but
finding
him
really
incapable
of
understanding
the
question
;
and
knowing
that
his
not
replying
would
only
infuriate
the
magistrate
the
more
,
and
add
to
the
severity
of
his
sentence
;
he
hazarded
a
guess
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
says
his
name
's
Tom
White
,
your
worship
,
"
said
the
kind
-
hearted
thief
-
taker
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
wo
n't
speak
out
,
wo
n't
he
?
"
said
Fang
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
Where
does
he
live
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
he
can
,
your
worship
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
officer
;
again
pretending
to
receive
Oliver
's
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Has
he
any
parents
?
"
inquired
Mr
Fang
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
says
they
died
in
his
infancy
,
your
worship
,
"
replied
the
officer
:
 
hazarding
the
usual
reply
.
   
<EOS>
At
this
point
of
the
inquiry
,
Oliver
raised
his
head
;
and
,
looking
round
with
imploring
eyes
,
murmured
a
feeble
prayer
for
a
draught
of
water
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stuff
and
nonsense
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Fang
:
 
"
do
n't
try
to
make
a
fool
of
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
really
is
ill
,
your
worship
,
"
remonstrated
the
officer
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
better
,
"
said
Mr
Fang
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
care
of
him
,
officer
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
raising
his
hands
instinctively
;
"
he
'll
fall
down
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stand
away
,
officer
,
"
cried
Fang
;
 
"
let
him
,
if
he
likes
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
availed
himself
of
the
kind
permission
,
and
fell
to
the
floor
in
a
fainting
fit
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
in
the
office
looked
at
each
other
,
but
no
one
dared
to
stir
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
knew
he
was
shamming
,
"
said
Fang
,
as
if
this
were
incontestable
proof
of
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
him
lie
there
;
he
'll
soon
be
tired
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
propose
to
deal
with
the
case
,
sir
?
"
 
<EOS>
inquired
the
clerk
in
a
low
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Summarily
,
"
replied
Mr
Fang
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
stands
committed
for
three
months
---
hard
labour
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
Clear
the
office
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
door
was
opened
for
this
purpose
,
and
a
couple
of
men
were
preparing
to
carry
the
insensible
boy
to
his
cell
;
when
an
elderly
man
of
decent
but
poor
appearance
,
clad
in
an
old
suit
of
black
,
rushed
hastily
into
the
office
,
and
advanced
towards
the
bench
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
,
stop
!
 
<EOS>
do
n't
take
him
away
!
 
<EOS>
For
Heaven
's
sake
stop
a
moment
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
new
comer
,
breathless
with
haste
.
   
<EOS>
Although
the
presiding
Genii
in
such
an
office
as
this
,
exercise
a
summary
and
arbitrary
power
over
the
liberties
,
the
good
name
,
the
character
,
almost
the
lives
,
of
Her
Majesty
's
subjects
,
expecially
of
the
poorer
class
;
and
although
,
within
such
walls
,
enough
fantastic
tricks
are
daily
played
to
make
the
angels
blind
with
weeping
;
they
are
closed
to
the
public
,
save
through
the
medium
of
the
daily
press.(Footnote
:
 
Or
were
virtually
,
then
.
)
<EOS>
Mr
Fang
was
consequently
not
a
little
indignant
to
see
an
unbidden
guest
enter
in
such
irreverent
disorder
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
?
 
<EOS>
Who
is
this
?
 
<EOS>
Turn
this
man
out
.
 
<EOS>
Clear
the
office
!
"
cried
Mr
Fang
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
WILL
speak
,
"
cried
the
man
;
"
I
will
not
be
turned
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
keep
the
book
-
stall
.
 
<EOS>
I
demand
to
be
sworn
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
put
down
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Fang
,
you
must
hear
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
refuse
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
man
was
right
.
 
<EOS>
His
manner
was
determined
;
and
the
matter
was
growing
rather
too
serious
to
be
hushed
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Swear
the
man
,
"
growled
Mr
Fang
.
<EOS>
with
a
very
ill
grace
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
man
,
what
have
you
got
to
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
said
the
man
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
saw
three
boys
:
 
two
others
and
the
prisoner
here
:
 
loitering
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
,
when
this
gentleman
was
reading
.
 
<EOS>
The
robbery
was
committed
by
another
boy
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
it
done
;
and
I
saw
that
this
boy
was
perfectly
amazed
and
stupified
by
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Having
by
this
time
recovered
a
little
breath
,
the
worthy
book
-
stall
keeper
proceeded
to
relate
,
in
a
more
coherent
manner
the
exact
circumstances
of
the
robbery
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
you
come
here
before
?
"
<EOS>
said
Fang
,
after
a
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
n't
a
soul
to
mind
the
shop
,
"
replied
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Everybody
who
could
have
helped
me
,
had
joined
in
the
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
get
nobody
till
five
minutes
ago
;
and
I
've
run
here
all
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
prosecutor
was
reading
,
was
he
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Fang
,
after
another
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
very
book
he
has
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
book
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
said
Fang
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
paid
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
is
not
,
"
replied
the
man
,
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
I
forgot
all
about
it
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
absent
old
gentleman
,
innocently
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
nice
person
to
prefer
a
charge
against
a
poor
boy
!
"
said
Fang
,
with
a
comical
effort
to
look
humane
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
consider
,
sir
,
that
you
have
obtained
possession
of
that
book
,
under
very
suspicious
and
disreputable
circumstances
;
and
you
may
think
yourself
very
fortunate
that
the
owner
of
the
property
declines
to
prosecute
.
<EOS>
Let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
,
my
man
,
or
the
law
will
overtake
you
yet
.
 
<EOS>
The
boy
is
discharged
.
 
<EOS>
Clear
the
office
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
D####n
me
!
"
cried
the
old
gentleman
,
bursting
out
with
the
rage
he
had
kept
down
so
long
,
"
d####n
me
!
  
<EOS>
I
'll
---
"
   
"
Clear
the
office
!
"
said
the
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Officers
,
do
you
hear
?
   
<EOS>
Clear
the
office
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
mandate
was
obeyed
;
and
the
indignant
Mr
Brownlow
was
conveyed
out
,
with
the
book
in
one
hand
,
and
the
bamboo
cane
in
the
other
:
 
in
a
perfect
phrenzy
of
rage
and
defiance
.
 
<EOS>
He
reached
the
yard
;
and
his
passion
vanished
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Oliver
Twist
lay
on
his
back
on
the
pavement
,
with
his
shirt
unbuttoned
,
and
his
temples
bathed
with
water
;
his
face
a
deadly
white
;
and
a
cold
tremble
convulsing
his
whole
frame
.
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
boy
,
poor
boy
!
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
bending
over
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Call
a
coach
,
somebody
,
pray
.
 
<EOS>
Directly
!
"
   
A
coach
was
obtained
,
and
Oliver
having
been
carefully
laid
on
the
seat
,
the
old
gentleman
got
in
and
sat
himself
on
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
accompany
you
?
"
said
the
book
-
stall
keeper
,
looking
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
me
,
yes
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
forgot
you
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
this
unhappy
book
still
!
<EOS>
Jump
in
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
no
time
to
lose
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
book
-
stall
keeper
got
into
the
coach
;
and
away
they
drove
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
12
.
<EOS>
In
which
Oliver
is
taken
better
care
of
than
he
ever
was
before
.
<EOS>
And
in
which
the
narrative
reverts
to
the
merry
old
gentleman
and
his
youthful
friends
.
 
<EOS>
The
coach
rattled
away
,
over
nearly
the
same
ground
as
that
which
Oliver
had
traversed
when
he
first
entered
London
in
company
with
the
Dodger
;
and
,
turning
a
different
way
when
it
reached
the
Angel
at
Islington
,
stopped
at
length
before
a
neat
house
,
in
a
quiet
shady
street
near
Pentonville
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
a
bed
was
prepared
,
without
loss
of
time
,
in
which
Mr
Brownlow
saw
his
young
charge
carefully
and
comfortably
deposited
;
and
here
,
he
was
tended
with
a
kindness
and
solicitude
that
knew
no
bounds
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
for
many
days
,
Oliver
remained
insensible
to
all
the
goodness
of
his
new
friends
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
rose
and
sank
,
and
rose
and
sank
again
,
and
many
times
after
that
;
and
still
the
boy
lay
stretched
on
his
uneasy
bed
,
dwindling
away
beneath
the
dry
and
wasting
heat
of
fever
.
 
<EOS>
The
worm
does
not
work
more
surely
on
the
dead
body
,
than
does
this
slow
creeping
fire
upon
the
living
frame
.
   
<EOS>
Weak
,
and
thin
,
and
pallid
,
he
awoke
at
last
from
what
seemed
to
have
been
a
long
and
troubled
dream
.
 
<EOS>
Feebly
raising
himself
in
the
bed
,
with
his
head
resting
on
his
trembling
arm
,
he
looked
anxiously
around
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
room
is
this
?
 
<EOS>
Where
have
I
been
brought
to
?
"
said
Oliver
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
not
the
place
I
went
to
sleep
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
uttered
these
words
in
a
feeble
voice
,
being
very
faint
and
weak
;
but
they
were
overheard
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
The
curtain
at
the
bed
's
head
was
hastily
drawn
back
,
and
a
motherly
old
lady
,
very
neatly
and
precisely
dressed
,
rose
as
she
undrew
it
,
from
an
arm
-
chair
close
by
,
in
which
she
had
been
sitting
at
needle
-
work
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
old
lady
softly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
very
quiet
,
or
you
will
be
ill
again
;
and
you
have
been
very
bad
,
---
as
bad
as
bad
could
be
,
pretty
nigh
.
 
<EOS>
Lie
down
again
;
there
's
a
dear
!
"
 
<EOS>
With
those
words
,
the
old
lady
very
gently
placed
Oliver
's
head
upon
the
pillow
;
and
,
smoothing
back
his
hair
from
his
forehead
,
looked
so
kindly
and
loving
in
his
face
,
that
he
could
not
help
placing
his
little
withered
hand
in
hers
,
and
drawing
it
round
his
neck
.
   
<EOS>
"
Save
us
!
"
said
the
old
lady
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
grateful
little
dear
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
Pretty
creetur
!
 
<EOS>
What
would
his
mother
feel
if
she
had
sat
by
him
as
I
have
,
and
could
see
him
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
she
does
see
me
,
"
whispered
Oliver
,
folding
his
hands
together
;
"
perhaps
she
has
sat
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
almost
feel
as
if
she
had
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
was
the
fever
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
old
lady
mildly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
was
,
"
replied
Oliver
,
"
because
heaven
is
a
long
way
off
;
and
they
are
too
happy
there
,
to
come
down
to
the
bedside
of
a
poor
boy
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
she
knew
I
was
ill
,
she
must
have
pitied
me
,
even
there
;
for
she
was
very
ill
herself
before
she
died
.
 
<EOS>
She
ca
n't
know
anything
about
me
though
,
"
added
Oliver
after
a
moment
's
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
she
had
seen
me
hurt
,
it
would
have
made
here
sorrowful
;
and
her
face
has
always
looked
sweet
and
happy
,
when
I
have
dreamed
of
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
lady
made
no
reply
to
this
;
but
wiping
her
eyes
first
,
and
her
spectacles
,
which
lay
on
the
counterpane
,
afterwards
,
as
if
they
were
part
and
parcel
of
those
features
,
brought
some
cool
stuff
for
Oliver
to
drink
;
and
then
,
patting
him
on
the
cheek
,
told
him
he
must
lie
very
quiet
,
or
he
would
be
ill
again
.
   
<EOS>
So
,
Oliver
kept
very
still
;
partly
because
he
was
anxious
to
obey
the
kind
old
lady
in
all
things
;
and
partly
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
because
he
was
completely
exhausted
with
what
he
had
already
said
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
fell
into
a
gentle
doze
,
from
which
he
was
awakened
by
the
light
of
a
candle
:
 
which
,
being
brought
near
the
bed
,
showed
him
a
gentleman
with
a
very
large
and
loud
-
ticking
gold
watch
in
his
hand
,
who
felt
his
pulse
,
and
said
he
was
a
great
deal
better
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
ARE
a
great
deal
better
,
are
you
not
,
my
dear
?
"
said
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
 
I
know
you
are
,
"
said
the
gentleman
:
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
hungry
too
,
an't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
answered
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
"
said
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
know
you
're
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
hungry
,
Mrs
Bedwin
,
"
said
the
gentleman
:
 
looking
very
wise
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
lady
made
a
respectful
inclination
of
the
head
,
which
seemed
to
say
that
she
thought
the
doctor
was
a
very
clever
man
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
appeared
much
of
the
same
opinion
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
feel
sleepy
,
do
n't
you
,
my
dear
?
"
said
the
doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
with
a
very
shrewd
and
satisfied
look
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
sleepy
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
thirsty
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
rather
thirsty
,
"
answered
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Just
as
I
expected
,
Mrs
Bedwin
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
natural
that
he
should
be
thirsty
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
give
him
a
little
tea
,
ma'am
,
and
some
dry
toast
without
any
butter
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
keep
him
too
warm
,
ma'am
;
but
be
careful
that
you
do
n't
let
him
be
too
cold
;
will
you
have
the
goodness
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
lady
dropped
a
curtsey
.
 
<EOS>
The
doctor
,
after
tasting
the
cool
stuff
,
and
expressing
a
qualified
approval
of
it
,
hurried
away
:
 
his
boots
creaking
in
a
very
important
and
wealthy
manner
as
he
went
downstairs
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
dozed
off
again
,
soon
after
this
;
when
he
awoke
,
it
was
nearly
twelve
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
lady
tenderly
bade
him
good
-
night
shortly
afterwards
,
and
left
him
in
charge
of
a
fat
old
woman
who
had
just
come
:
 
bringing
with
her
,
in
a
little
bundle
,
a
small
Prayer
Book
and
a
large
nightcap
.
<EOS>
Putting
the
latter
on
her
head
and
the
former
on
the
table
,
the
old
woman
,
after
telling
Oliver
that
she
had
come
to
sit
up
with
him
,
drew
her
chair
close
to
the
fire
and
went
off
into
a
series
of
short
naps
,
chequered
at
frequent
intervals
with
sundry
tumblings
forward
,
and
divers
moans
and
chokings
.
<EOS>
These
,
however
,
had
no
worse
effect
than
causing
her
to
rub
her
nose
very
hard
,
and
then
fall
asleep
again
.
   
<EOS>
And
thus
the
night
crept
slowly
on
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
lay
awake
for
some
time
,
counting
the
little
circles
of
light
<EOS>
which
the
reflection
of
the
rushlight
-
shade
threw
upon
the
ceiling
;
or
tracing
with
his
languid
eyes
the
intricate
pattern
of
the
paper
on
the
wall
.
<EOS>
The
darkness
and
the
deep
stillness
of
the
room
were
very
solemn
;
as
they
brought
into
the
boy
's
mind
the
thought
that
death
had
been
hovering
there
,
for
many
days
and
nights
,
and
might
yet
fill
it
with
the
gloom
and
dread
of
his
awful
presence
,
he
turned
his
face
upon
the
pillow
,
and
fervently
prayed
to
Heaven
.
   
<EOS>
Gradually
,
he
fell
into
that
deep
tranquil
sleep
which
ease
from
recent
suffering
alone
imparts
;
that
calm
and
peaceful
rest
which
it
is
pain
to
wake
from
.
 
<EOS>
Who
,
if
this
were
death
,
would
be
roused
again
to
all
the
struggles
and
turmoils
of
life
;
to
all
its
cares
for
the
present
;
its
anxieties
for
the
future
;
more
than
all
,
its
weary
recollections
of
the
past
!
   
<EOS>
It
had
been
bright
day
,
for
hours
,
when
Oliver
opened
his
eyes
;
he
felt
cheerful
and
happy
.
 
<EOS>
The
crisis
of
the
disease
was
safely
past
.
 
<EOS>
He
belonged
to
the
world
again
.
   
<EOS>
In
three
days
'
time
he
was
able
to
sit
in
an
easy
-
chair
,
well
propped
up
with
pillows
;
and
,
as
he
was
still
too
weak
to
walk
,
Mrs
Bedwin
had
him
carried
downstairs
into
the
little
housekeeper
's
room
,
which
belonged
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Having
him
set
,
here
,
by
the
fire
-
side
,
the
good
old
lady
sat
herself
down
too
;
and
,
being
in
a
state
of
considerable
delight
at
seeing
him
so
much
better
<EOS>
,
forthwith
began
to
cry
most
violently
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
me
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
old
lady
;
"
I
'm
only
having
a
regular
good
cry
.
 
<EOS>
There
;
it
's
all
over
now
;
and
I
'm
quite
comfortable
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
very
,
very
kind
to
me
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
never
you
mind
that
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
old
lady
;
"
that
's
got
nothing
to
do
with
your
broth
;
and
it
's
full
time
you
had
it
;
for
the
doctor
says
Mr
Brownlow
may
come
in
to
see
you
this
morning
;
and
we
must
get
up
our
best
looks
,
because
the
better
we
look
,
the
more
he
'll
be
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
this
,
the
old
lady
applied
herself
to
warming
up
,
in
a
little
saucepan
,
a
basin
full
of
broth
:
 
strong
enough
,
Oliver
thought
,
to
furnish
an
ample
dinner
,
when
reduced
to
the
regulation
strength
,
for
three
hundred
and
fifty
paupers
,
at
the
lowest
computation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
fond
of
pictures
,
dear
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
old
lady
,
seeing
that
Oliver
had
fixed
his
eyes
,
most
intently
,
on
a
portrait
which
hung
against
the
wall
;
just
opposite
his
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
quite
know
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Oliver
,
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
canvas
;
"
I
have
seen
so
few
that
I
hardly
know
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
beautiful
,
mild
face
that
lady
's
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
old
lady
,
"
painters
always
make
ladies
out
prettier
than
they
are
,
or
they
would
n't
get
any
custom
,
child
.
<EOS>
The
man
that
invented
the
machine
for
taking
likenesses
might
have
known
that
would
never
succeed
;
it
's
a
deal
too
honest
.
 
<EOS>
A
deal
,
"
said
the
old
lady
,
laughing
very
heartily
at
her
own
acuteness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
---
is
that
a
likeness
,
ma'am
?
"
said
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
old
lady
,
looking
up
for
a
moment
from
the
broth
;
"
that
's
a
portrait
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Whose
,
ma'am
?
"
asked
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
really
,
my
dear
,
I
do
n't
know
,
"
answered
the
old
lady
in
a
good
-
humoured
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
a
likeness
of
anybody
that
you
or
I
know
,
I
expect
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
to
strike
your
fancy
,
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
pretty
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sure
you
're
not
afraid
of
it
?
"
said
the
old
lady
:
observing
in
great
surprise
,
the
look
of
awe
with
which
the
child
regarded
the
painting
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
,
no
,
"
returned
Oliver
quickly
;
"
but
the
eyes
look
so
sorrowful
;
and
where
I
sit
<EOS>
,
they
seem
fixed
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
makes
my
heart
beat
,
"
added
Oliver
in
a
low
voice
,
"
as
if
it
was
alive
,
and
wanted
to
speak
to
me
,
but
could
n't
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
save
us
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
old
lady
,
starting
;
"
do
n't
talk
in
that
way
,
child
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
weak
and
nervous
after
your
illness
.
<EOS>
Let
me
wheel
your
chair
round
to
the
other
side
;
and
then
you
wo
n't
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
!
"
said
the
old
lady
,
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
;
"
you
do
n't
see
it
now
,
at
all
events
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
DID
see
it
in
his
mind
's
eye
as
distinctly
as
if
he
had
not
altered
his
position
;
but
he
thought
it
better
not
to
worry
the
kind
old
lady
;
so
he
smiled
gently
when
she
looked
at
him
;
and
Mrs
Bedwin
,
satisfied
that
he
felt
more
comfortable
,
salted
and
broke
bits
of
toasted
bread
into
the
broth
,
with
all
the
bustle
befitting
so
solemn
a
preparation
.
<EOS>
Oliver
got
through
it
with
extraordinary
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
swallowed
the
last
spoonful
,
when
there
came
a
soft
rap
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
"
said
the
old
lady
;
and
in
walked
Mr
Brownlow
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
the
old
gentleman
came
in
as
brisk
as
need
be
;
but
,
he
had
no
sooner
raised
his
spectacles
on
his
forehead
,
and
thrust
his
hands
behind
the
skirts
of
his
dressing
-
gown
to
take
a
good
long
look
at
Oliver
,
than
his
countenance
underwent
a
very
great
variety
of
odd
contortions
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
looked
very
worn
and
shadowy
from
sickness
,
and
made
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
stand
up
,
out
of
respect
to
his
benefactor
,
which
terminated
in
his
sinking
back
into
the
chair
again
;
and
the
fact
is
,
if
the
truth
must
be
told
,
that
Mr
Brownlow
's
heart
,
being
large
enough
for
any
six
ordinary
old
gentlemen
of
humane
disposition
,
forced
a
supply
of
tears
into
his
eyes
,
by
some
hydraulic
process
which
we
are
not
sufficiently
philosophical
to
be
in
a
condition
to
explain
.
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
boy
,
poor
boy
!
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
clearing
his
throat
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
rather
hoarse
this
morning
,
Mrs
Bedwin
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
I
have
caught
cold
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Bedwin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Everything
you
have
had
,
has
been
well
aired
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
Bedwin
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
;
<EOS>
"
I
rather
think
I
had
a
damp
napkin
at
dinner
-
time
yesterday
;
but
never
mind
that
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
feel
,
my
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
happy
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
very
grateful
indeed
,
sir
,
for
your
goodness
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
by
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
stoutly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
given
him
any
nourishment
,
Bedwin
?
 
<EOS>
Any
slops
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
just
had
a
basin
of
beautiful
strong
broth
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mrs
Bedwin
:
 
drawing
herself
up
slightly
,
and
laying
strong
emphasis
on
the
last
word
:
 
to
intimate
that
between
slops
,
and
broth
will
compounded
,
there
existed
no
affinity
or
connection
whatsoever
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ugh
!
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
with
a
slight
shudder
;
"
a
couple
of
glasses
of
port
wine
would
have
done
him
a
great
deal
more
good
.
<EOS>
Would
n't
they
,
Tom
White
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Oliver
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
little
invalid
:
 
with
a
look
of
great
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oliver
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
;
"
Oliver
<EOS>
what
?
 
<EOS>
Oliver
White
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
Twist
,
Oliver
Twist
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Queer
name
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
made
you
tell
the
magistrate
your
name
was
White
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
told
him
so
,
sir
,
"
returned
Oliver
in
amazement
.
   
<EOS>
This
sounded
so
like
a
falsehood
,
that
the
old
gentleman
looked
somewhat
sternly
in
Oliver
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
doubt
him
;
there
was
truth
in
every
one
of
its
thin
and
sharpened
lineaments
.
   
<EOS>
"
Some
mistake
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
although
his
motive
for
looking
steadily
at
Oliver
no
longer
existed
,
the
old
idea
of
the
resemblance
between
his
features
and
some
familiar
face
came
upon
him
so
strongly
,
that
he
could
not
withdraw
his
gaze
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
are
not
angry
with
me
,
sir
?
"
said
Oliver
,
raising
his
eyes
beseechingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
replied
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
!
<EOS>
what
's
this
?
 
<EOS>
Bedwin
,
look
there
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
pointed
hastily
to
the
picture
over
Oliver
's
head
,
and
then
to
the
boy
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
its
living
copy
.
<EOS>
The
eyes
,
the
head
,
the
mouth
;
every
feature
was
the
same
.
<EOS>
The
expression
was
,
for
the
instant
,
so
precisely
alike
,
that
the
minutest
line
seemed
copied
with
startling
accuracy
!
   
<EOS>
Oliver
knew
not
the
cause
of
this
sudden
exclamation
;
for
,
not
being
strong
enough
to
bear
the
start
it
gave
him
,
he
fainted
away
.
 
<EOS>
A
weakness
on
his
part
,
which
affords
the
narrative
an
opportunity
of
relieving
the
reader
from
suspense
,
in
behalf
of
the
two
young
pupils
of
the
Merry
Old
Gentleman
;
and
of
recording
---
    
That
when
the
Dodger
,
and
his
accomplished
friend
Master
Bates
,
joined
in
the
hue
-
and
-
cry
which
was
raised
at
Oliver
's
heels
,
in
consequence
of
their
executing
an
illegal
conveyance
of
Mr
Brownlow
's
personal
property
,
as
has
been
already
described
<EOS>
,
they
were
actuated
by
a
very
laudable
and
becoming
regard
for
themselves
;
and
forasmuch
as
the
freedom
of
the
subject
and
the
liberty
of
the
individual
are
among
the
first
and
proudest
boasts
of
a
true
-
hearted
Englishman
,
so
,
I
need
hardly
beg
the
reader
to
observe
,
that
this
action
should
tend
to
exalt
them
in
the
opinion
of
all
public
and
patriotic
men
,
in
almost
as
great
a
degree
as
this
strong
proof
of
their
anxiety
for
their
own
preservation
and
safety
goes
to
corroborate
and
confirm
the
little
code
of
laws
which
certain
profound
and
sound
-
judging
philosophers
have
laid
down
as
the
main
-
springs
of
all
Nature
's
deeds
and
actions
:
 
the
said
philosophers
very
wisely
reducing
the
good
lady
's
proceedings
to
matters
of
maxim
and
theory
:
 
and
,
by
a
very
neat
and
pretty
compliment
to
her
exalted
wisdom
and
understanding
,
putting
entirely
out
of
sight
any
considerations
of
heart
,
or
generous
impulse
and
feeling
.
<EOS>
For
,
these
are
matters
totally
beneath
a
female
who
is
acknowledged
by
universal
admission
to
be
far
above
the
numerous
little
foibles
and
weaknesses
of
her
sex
.
   
<EOS>
If
I
wanted
any
further
proof
of
the
strictly
philosophical
nature
of
the
conduct
of
these
young
gentlemen
in
their
very
delicate
predicament
,
I
should
at
once
find
it
in
the
fact
<EOS>
(
also
recorded
in
a
foregoing
part
of
this
narrative
)
,
of
their
quitting
the
pursuit
,
when
the
general
attention
was
fixed
upon
Oliver
;
and
making
immediately
for
their
home
by
the
shortest
possible
cut
.
 
<EOS>
Although
I
do
not
mean
to
assert
that
it
is
usually
the
practice
of
renowned
and
learned
sages
,
to
shorten
the
road
to
any
great
conclusion
(
their
course
indeed
being
rather
to
lengthen
the
distance
,
by
various
circumlocations
and
discursive
staggerings
,
like
unto
those
in
which
drunken
men
under
the
pressure
of
a
too
mighty
flow
of
ideas
,
are
prone
to
indulge
)
;
still
,
I
do
mean
to
say
,
and
do
say
distinctly
,
that
it
is
the
invariable
practice
of
many
mighty
philosophers
,
in
carrying
out
their
theories
,
to
evince
great
wisdom
and
foresight
in
providing
against
every
possible
contingency
which
can
be
supposed
at
all
likely
to
affect
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
to
do
a
great
right
,
you
may
do
a
little
wrong
;
and
you
may
take
any
means
which
the
end
to
be
attained
,
will
justify
;
the
amount
of
the
right
,
or
the
amount
of
the
wrong
,
or
indeed
the
distinction
between
the
two
,
being
left
entirely
to
the
philosopher
concerned
,
to
be
settled
and
determined
by
his
clear
,
comprehensive
,
and
impartial
view
of
his
own
particular
case
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
the
two
boys
had
scoured
,
with
great
rapidity
,
through
a
most
intricate
maze
of
narrow
streets
and
courts
,
that
they
ventured
to
halt
beneath
a
low
and
dark
archway
.
 
<EOS>
Having
remained
silent
here
,
just
long
enough
to
recover
breath
to
speak
,
Master
Bates
uttered
an
exclamation
of
amusement
and
delight
;
and
,
bursting
into
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
laughter
,
flung
himself
upon
a
doorstep
,
and
rolled
thereon
in
a
transport
of
mirth
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
Dodger
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
"
roared
Charley
Bates
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
noise
,
"
remonstrated
the
Dodger
,
looking
cautiously
round
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
want
to
be
grabbed
,
stupid
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
"
said
Charley
,
"
I
ca
n't
help
it
!
 
<EOS>
To
see
him
splitting
away
at
that
pace
,
and
cutting
round
the
corners
,
and
knocking
up
again
'
the
posts
,
and
starting
on
again
as
if
he
was
made
of
iron
as
well
as
them
,
and
me
with
the
wipe
in
my
pocket
,
singing
out
arter
him
---
oh
,
my
eye
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
vivid
imagination
of
Master
Bates
presented
the
scene
before
him
in
too
strong
colours
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
arrived
at
this
apostrophe
,
he
again
rolled
upon
the
door
-
step
,
and
laughed
louder
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
'll
Fagin
say
?
"
inquired
the
Dodger
;
taking
advantage
of
the
next
interval
of
breathlessness
on
the
part
of
his
friend
to
propound
the
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
repeated
Charley
Bates
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
what
?
"
said
the
Dodger
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
should
he
say
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Charley
:
 
<EOS>
stopping
rather
suddenly
in
his
merriment
;
for
the
Dodger
's
manner
was
impressive
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
should
he
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dawkins
whistled
for
a
couple
of
minutes
;
then
,
taking
off
his
hat
,
scratched
his
head
,
and
nodded
thrice
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
said
Charley
.
   
<EOS>
"
Toor
rul
lol
loo
,
gammon
and
spinnage
,
the
frog
he
would
n't
,
and
high
cockolorum
,
"
said
the
Dodger
:
 
with
a
slight
sneer
on
his
intellectual
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
explanatory
,
but
not
satisfactory
.
 
<EOS>
Master
Bates
felt
it
so
;
and
again
said
,
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
Dodger
made
no
reply
;
but
putting
his
hat
on
again
,
and
gathering
the
skirts
of
his
long
-
tailed
coat
under
his
arm
,
thrust
his
tongue
into
his
cheek
,
slapped
the
bridge
of
his
nose
some
half
-
dozen
times
in
a
familiar
but
expressive
manner
,
and
turning
on
his
heel
,
slunk
down
the
court
.
 
<EOS>
Master
Bates
followed
,
with
a
thoughtful
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
The
noise
of
footsteps
on
the
creaking
stairs
,
a
few
minutes
after
the
occurrence
of
this
conversation
,
roused
the
merry
old
gentleman
as
he
sat
over
the
fire
with
a
saveloy
and
a
small
loaf
in
his
hand
;
a
pocket
-
knife
in
his
right
;
and
a
pewter
pot
on
the
trivet
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
rascally
smile
on
his
white
face
as
he
turned
round
,
and
looking
sharply
out
from
under
his
thick
red
eyebrows
,
bent
his
ear
towards
the
door
,
and
listened
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
's
this
?
<EOS>
"
muttered
the
Jew
:
 
changing
countenance
;
"
only
two
of
'em
?
 
<EOS>
Where
's
the
third
?
 
<EOS>
They
ca
n't
have
got
into
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
Hark
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
footsteps
approached
nearer
;
they
reached
the
landing
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
slowly
opened
;
and
the
Dodger
and
Charley
Bates
entered
,
closing
it
behind
them
.

Some
new
acquaintances
are
introduced
to
the
intelligent
reader
,
connected
with
whom
various
pleasant
matters
are
related
,
appertaining
to
this
history
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
's
Oliver
?
"
said
the
Jew
,
rising
with
a
menacing
look
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
's
the
boy
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
young
thieves
eyed
their
preceptor
as
if
they
were
alarmed
at
his
violence
;
and
looked
uneasily
at
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
made
no
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
become
of
the
boy
?
"
said
the
Jew
,
seizing
the
Dodger
tightly
by
the
collar
,
and
threatening
him
with
horrid
imprecations
.
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
out
,
or
I
'll
throttle
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Fagin
looked
so
very
much
in
earnest
,
that
Charley
Bates
,
who
deemed
it
prudent
in
all
cases
to
be
on
the
safe
side
,
and
who
conceived
it
by
no
means
improbable
that
it
might
be
his
turn
to
be
throttled
second
,
dropped
upon
his
knees
,
and
raised
a
loud
,
well
-
sustained
,
and
continuous
roar
---
something
between
a
mad
bull
and
a
speaking
trumpet
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
speak
?
<EOS>
"
thundered
the
Jew
:
 
shaking
the
Dodger
so
much
that
his
keeping
in
the
big
coat
at
all
,
seemed
perfectly
miraculous
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
traps
have
got
him
,
and
that
's
all
about
it
,
"
said
the
Dodger
,
sullenly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
let
go
o
'
me
,
will
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
swinging
himself
,
at
one
jerk
,
clean
out
of
the
big
coat
,
which
he
left
in
the
Jew
's
hands
,
the
Dodger
snatched
up
the
toasting
fork
,
and
made
a
pass
at
the
merry
old
gentleman
's
waistcoat
;
which
,
if
it
had
taken
effect
,
would
have
let
a
little
more
merriment
out
,
than
could
have
been
easily
replaced
.
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
stepped
back
in
this
emergency
,
with
more
agility
than
could
have
been
anticipated
in
a
man
of
his
apparent
decrepitude
;
and
,
seizing
up
the
pot
,
prepared
to
hurl
it
at
his
assailant
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
But
Charley
Bates
,
at
this
moment
,
calling
his
attention
by
a
perfectly
terrific
howl
,
he
suddenly
altered
its
destination
,
and
flung
it
full
at
that
young
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
the
blazes
is
in
the
wind
now
!
<EOS>
"
growled
a
deep
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
pitched
that
'
ere
at
me
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
well
<EOS>
it
's
the
beer
,
and
not
the
pot
,
as
hit
me
,
or
I
'd
have
settled
somebody
.
 
<EOS>
I
might
have
know'd
,
as
nobody
but
an
infernal
,
rich
,
plundering
,
thundering
old
Jew
could
afford
to
throw
away
any
drink
but
water
---
and
not
that
,
unless
he
done
the
River
Company
every
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
Wot
's
it
all
about
,
Fagin
?
 
<EOS>
D
---
 
me
,
if
my
neck
-
handkercher
an't
lined
with
beer
!
 
<EOS>
Come
in
,
you
sneaking
warmint
;
wot
are
you
stopping
outside
for
,
as
if
you
was
ashamed
of
your
master
!
 
<EOS>
Come
in
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
man
who
growled
out
these
words
,
was
a
stoutly
-
built
fellow
of
about
five
-
and
-
thirty
,
in
a
black
velveteen
coat
,
very
soiled
drab
breeches
,
lace
-
up
half
boots
,
and
grey
cotton
stockings
which
inclosed
a
bulky
pair
of
legs
,
with
large
swelling
calves
;
---
the
kind
of
legs
,
which
in
such
costume
,
always
look
in
an
unfinished
and
incomplete
state
without
a
set
of
fetters
to
garnish
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
brown
hat
on
his
head
,
and
a
dirty
belcher
handkerchief
round
his
neck
:
 
with
the
long
frayed
ends
of
which
he
smeared
the
beer
from
his
face
as
he
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
He
disclosed
,
when
he
had
done
so
,
a
broad
heavy
countenance
with
a
beard
of
three
days
'
growth
,
and
two
scowling
eyes
;
<EOS>
one
of
which
displayed
various
parti
-
coloured
symptoms
of
having
been
recently
damaged
by
a
blow
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
d'ye
hear
?
<EOS>
"
growled
this
engaging
ruffian
.
   
<EOS>
A
white
shaggy
dog
,
with
his
face
scratched
and
torn
in
twenty
different
places
,
skulked
into
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
you
come
in
afore
?
"
said
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
getting
too
proud
to
own
me
afore
company
,
are
you
?
 
<EOS>
Lie
down
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
command
was
accompanied
with
a
kick
,
which
sent
the
animal
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
appeared
well
used
to
it
,
however
;
for
he
coiled
himself
up
in
a
corner
very
quietly
,
without
uttering
a
sound
,
and
winking
his
very
ill
-
looking
eyes
twenty
times
in
a
minute
,
appeared
to
occupy
himself
in
taking
a
survey
of
the
apartment
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
up
to
?
 
<EOS>
Ill
-
treating
the
boys
,
you
covetous
,
avaricious
,
in
-
sa
-
ti
-
a
-
ble
old
fence
?
"
said
the
man
,
seating
himself
deliberately
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
they
do
n't
murder
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
would
if
I
was
them
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
'd
been
your
'
prentice
,
I
'd
have
done
it
long
ago
,
and
---
<EOS>
no
,
I
could
n't
have
sold
you
afterwards
,
for
you
're
fit
for
nothing
but
keeping
as
a
curiousity
of
ugliness
in
a
glass
bottle
,
and
I
suppose
they
do
n't
blow
glass
bottles
large
enough
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
hush
!
<EOS>
Mr
Sikes
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
trembling
;
"
do
n't
speak
so
loud
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
None
of
your
mistering
,
"
replied
the
ruffian
;
"
you
always
mean
mischief
when
you
come
that
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
my
name
:
 
out
with
it
!
 
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
disgrace
it
when
the
time
comes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
then
---
Bill
Sikes
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
with
abject
humility
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
seem
out
of
humour
,
Bill
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
am
,
"
replied
Sikes
;
"
I
should
think
you
was
rather
out
of
sorts
too
,
unless
you
mean
as
little
harm
when
you
throw
pewter
pots
about
,
as
you
do
when
you
blab
and
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
Are
you
mad
?
"
said
the
Jew
,
catching
the
man
by
the
sleeve
,
and
pointing
towards
the
boys
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sikes
contented
himself
with
tying
an
imaginary
knot
under
his
left
ear
,
and
jerking
his
head
over
on
the
right
shoulder
;
a
piece
of
dumb
show
which
the
Jew
appeared
to
understand
perfectly
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
,
in
ca
nt
terms
,
with
which
his
whole
conversation
was
plentifully
besprinkled
,
but
which
would
be
quite
unintelligible
if
they
were
recorded
here
,
demanded
a
glass
of
liquor
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
mind
you
do
n't
poison
it
,
"
said
Mr
Sikes
,
laying
his
hat
upon
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
said
in
jest
;
but
if
the
speaker
could
have
seen
the
evil
leer
with
which
the
Jew
bit
his
pale
lip
as
he
turned
round
to
the
cupboard
,
he
might
have
thought
the
caution
not
wholly
unnecessary
,
or
the
wish
(
at
all
events
)
to
improve
upon
the
distiller
's
ingenuity
not
very
far
from
the
old
gentleman
's
merry
heart
.
   
<EOS>
After
swallowing
two
of
three
glasses
of
spirits
,
Mr
Sikes
condescended
to
take
some
notice
of
the
young
gentlemen
;
which
gracious
act
led
to
a
conversation
,
in
which
the
cause
and
manner
of
Oliver
's
capture
were
circumstantially
detailed
,
with
such
alterations
and
improvements
on
the
truth
,
as
to
the
Dodger
appeared
most
advisable
under
the
circumstances
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
"
that
he
may
say
something
which
will
get
us
into
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
very
likely
,
"
returned
Sikes
with
a
malicious
grin
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
blowed
upon
,
Fagin
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
'm
afraid
<EOS>
,
you
see
,
added
the
Jew
,
speaking
as
if
he
had
not
noticed
the
interruption
;
and
regarding
the
other
closely
as
he
did
so
,
---
"
I
'm
afraid
that
,
if
the
game
was
up
with
us
,
it
might
be
up
with
a
good
many
more
,
and
that
it
would
come
out
rather
worse
for
you
than
it
would
for
me
,
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
man
started
,
and
turned
round
upon
the
Jew
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
old
gentleman
's
shoulders
were
shrugged
up
to
his
ears
;
and
his
eyes
were
vacantly
staring
on
the
opposite
wall
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
long
pause
.
<EOS>
Every
member
of
the
respectable
coterie
appeared
plunged
in
his
own
reflections
;
not
excepting
the
dog
,
who
by
a
certain
malicious
licking
of
his
lips
seemed
to
be
meditating
an
attack
upon
the
legs
of
the
first
gentleman
or
lady
he
might
encounter
in
the
streets
when
he
went
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
Somebody
must
find
out
wot
's
been
done
at
the
office
,
"
said
Mr
Sikes
in
a
much
lower
tone
than
he
had
taken
since
he
came
in
.
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
nodded
assent
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
he
has
n't
peached
,
and
is
committed
,
there
's
no
fear
till
he
comes
out
again
,
"
said
Mr
Sikes
,
"
and
then
he
must
be
taken
care
on
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
get
hold
of
him
somehow
.
"
   
<EOS>
Again
the
Jew
nodded
.
   
<EOS>
The
prudence
of
this
line
of
action
,
indeed
,
was
obvious
;
but
,
unfortunately
,
there
was
one
very
strong
objection
to
its
being
adopted
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
,
that
the
Dodger
,
and
Charley
Bates
,
and
Fagin
,
and
Mr
William
Sikes
,
happened
,
one
and
all
,
to
entertain
a
violent
and
deeply
-
rooted
antipathy
to
going
near
a
police
-
office
on
any
ground
or
pretext
whatever
.
   
<EOS>
How
long
they
might
have
sat
and
looked
at
each
other
,
in
a
state
of
uncertainty
<EOS>
not
the
most
pleasant
of
its
kind
<EOS>
,
it
is
difficult
to
guess
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
necessary
to
make
any
guesses
on
the
subject
,
however
;
for
the
sudden
entrance
of
the
two
young
ladies
whom
Oliver
had
seen
on
a
former
occasion
,
caused
the
conversation
to
flow
afresh
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
very
thing
!
"
said
the
Jew
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bet
will
go
;
wo
n't
you
,
my
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
s
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
young
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
Only
just
up
to
the
office
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
Jew
coaxingly
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
due
to
the
young
lady
to
say
that
she
did
not
positively
affirm
that
she
would
not
,
but
that
she
merely
expressed
an
emphatic
and
earnest
desire
to
be
"
blessed
"
if
she
would
;
a
polite
and
delicate
evasion
of
the
request
,
which
shows
the
young
lady
to
have
been
possessed
of
that
natural
good
breeding
which
can
not
bear
to
inflict
upon
a
fellow
-
creature
,
the
pain
of
a
direct
and
pointed
refusal
.
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
's
countenance
fell
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
from
this
young
lady
,
who
was
gaily
,
not
to
say
gorgeously
attired
,
in
a
red
gown
,
green
boots
,
and
yellow
curl
-
papers
,
to
the
other
female
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nancy
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
Jew
in
a
soothing
manner
,
"
what
do
YOU
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
it
wo
n't
do
;
so
it
's
no
use
a
-
trying
it
on
,
Fagin
,
"
replied
Nancy
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
that
?
"
said
Mr
Sikes
,
looking
up
in
a
surly
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
I
say
,
Bill
,
"
replied
the
lady
collectedly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
're
just
the
very
person
for
it
,
"
reasoned
Mr
Sikes
:
"
nobody
about
here
knows
anything
of
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
as
I
do
n't
want
'em
to
,
neither
,
"
replied
Nancy
in
the
same
composed
manner
<EOS>
,
"
it
's
rather
more
no
than
yes
with
me
,
Bill
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
'll
go
,
Fagin
,
"
said
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
she
wo
n't
,
Fagin
,
"
said
Nancy
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
she
will
,
Fagin
,
"
said
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
And
Mr
Sikes
was
right
.
 
<EOS>
By
dint
of
alternate
threats
,
promises
,
and
bribes
,
the
lady
in
question
was
ultimately
prevailed
upon
to
undertake
the
commission
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
not
,
indeed
,
withheld
by
the
same
considerations
as
her
agreeable
friend
;
for
,
having
recently
removed
into
the
neighborhood
of
Field
Lane
from
the
remote
but
genteel
suburb
of
Ratcliffe
,
she
was
not
under
the
same
apprehension
of
being
recognised
by
any
of
her
numerous
acquaintance
.
   
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
with
a
clean
white
apron
tied
over
her
gown
,
and
her
curl
-
papers
tucked
up
under
a
straw
bonnet
,
---
both
articles
of
dress
being
provided
from
the
Jew
's
inexhaustible
stock
,
---
<EOS>
Miss
Nancy
prepared
to
issue
forth
on
her
errand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
minute
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
producing
,
a
little
covered
basket
.
 
<EOS>
"
Carry
that
in
one
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
looks
more
respectable
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Give
her
a
door
-
key
to
carry
in
her
t'other
one
,
Fagin
,
"
said
Sikes
;
"
it
looks
real
and
genivine
like
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
my
dear
,
so
it
does
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
hanging
a
large
street
-
door
key
on
the
forefinger
of
the
young
lady
's
right
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
;
very
good
!
 
<EOS>
Very
good
indeed
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
Jew
,
rubbing
his
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
brother
!
 
<EOS>
My
poor
,
dear
,
sweet
,
innocent
little
brother
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Nancy
,
bursting
into
tears
,
and
wringing
the
little
basket
and
the
street
-
door
key
in
an
agony
of
distress
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
has
become
of
him
!
 
<EOS>
Where
have
they
taken
him
to
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
do
have
pity
,
and
tell
me
what
's
been
done
with
the
dear
boy
,
gentlemen
;
do
,
gentlemen
,
if
you
please
,
gentlemen
!
"
   
<EOS>
Having
uttered
those
words
in
a
most
lamentable
and
heart
-
broken
tone
:
 
to
the
immeasurable
delight
of
her
hearers
:
 
Miss
Nancy
paused
,
winked
to
the
company
,
nodded
smilingly
round
,
and
disappeared
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
she
's
a
clever
girl
,
my
dears
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
turning
round
to
his
young
friends
,
and
shaking
his
head
gravely
,
as
if
in
mute
admonition
to
them
to
follow
the
bright
example
they
had
just
beheld
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
honour
to
her
sex
,
"
said
Mr
Sikes
,
filling
his
glass
,
and
smiting
the
table
with
his
enormous
fist
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
her
health
,
and
wishing
they
was
all
like
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
While
these
,
and
many
other
encomiums
,
were
being
passed
on
the
accomplished
Nancy
,
that
young
lady
made
the
best
of
her
way
to
the
police
-
office
;
whither
,
notwithstanding
a
little
natural
timidity
consequent
upon
walking
through
the
streets
alone
and
unprotected
,
she
arrived
in
perfect
safety
shortly
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
Entering
by
the
back
way
,
she
tapped
softly
with
the
key
at
one
of
the
cell
-
doors
,
and
listened
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
sound
within
:
 
<EOS>
so
she
coughed
and
listened
again
.
 
<EOS>
Still
there
was
no
reply
:
 
so
she
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nolly
,
dear
?
"
murmured
Nancy
in
a
gentle
voice
;
"
Nolly
?
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
nobody
inside
but
a
miserable
shoeless
criminal
,
who
had
been
taken
up
for
playing
the
flute
,
and
who
,
the
offence
against
society
having
been
clearly
proved
,
had
been
very
properly
committed
by
Mr
Fang
to
the
House
of
Correction
for
one
month
;
with
the
appropriate
and
amusing
remark
that
since
he
had
so
much
breath
to
spare
,
it
would
be
more
wholesomely
expended
on
the
treadmill
than
in
a
musical
instrument
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
no
answer
:
being
occupied
mentally
bewailing
the
loss
of
the
flute
,
which
had
been
confiscated
for
the
use
of
the
county
:
 
<EOS>
so
Nancy
passed
on
to
the
next
cell
,
and
knocked
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
"
cried
a
faint
and
feeble
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
a
little
boy
here
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Nancy
,
with
a
preliminary
sob
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
the
voice
;
"
God
forbid
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
a
vagrant
of
sixty
-
five
,
who
was
going
to
prison
for
NOT
playing
the
flute
;
or
,
in
other
words
,
for
begging
in
the
streets
,
and
doing
nothing
for
his
livelihood
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
next
cell
was
another
man
,
who
was
going
to
the
same
prison
for
hawking
tin
saucepans
without
license
;
thereby
doing
something
for
his
living
,
in
defiance
of
the
Stamp
-
office
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
as
neither
of
these
criminals
answered
to
the
name
of
Oliver
,
or
knew
anything
about
him
,
Nancy
made
straight
up
to
the
bluff
officer
in
the
striped
waistcoat
;
and
with
the
most
piteous
wailings
and
lamentations
,
rendered
more
piteous
by
a
prompt
and
efficient
use
of
the
street
-
door
key
and
the
little
basket
,
demanded
her
own
dear
brother
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
got
him
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
"
<EOS>
screamed
Nancy
,
in
a
distracted
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
gentleman
's
got
him
,
"
replied
the
officer
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
gracious
heavens
!
 
<EOS>
What
gentleman
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Nancy
.
   
<EOS>
In
reply
to
this
incoherent
questioning
,
the
old
man
informed
the
deeply
affected
sister
that
Oliver
had
been
taken
ill
in
the
office
,
and
discharged
in
consequence
of
a
witness
having
proved
the
robbery
to
have
been
committed
by
another
boy
,
not
in
custody
;
and
that
the
prosecutor
had
carried
him
away
,
in
an
insensible
condition
,
to
his
own
residence
:
 
of
and
concerning
which
,
all
the
informant
knew
was
,
that
it
was
somewhere
in
Pentonville
<EOS>
,
he
having
heard
that
word
mentioned
in
the
directions
to
the
coachman
.
   
<EOS>
In
a
dreadful
state
of
doubt
and
uncertainty
,
the
agonised
young
woman
staggered
to
the
gate
,
and
then
,
exchanging
her
faltering
walk
for
a
swift
run
,
returned
by
the
most
devious
and
complicated
route
she
could
think
of
,
to
the
domicile
of
the
Jew
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bill
Sikes
no
sooner
heard
the
account
of
the
expedition
delivered
,
than
he
very
hastily
called
up
the
white
dog
,
and
,
putting
on
his
hat
,
expeditiously
departed
:
 
without
devoting
any
time
to
the
formality
of
wishing
the
company
good
-
morning
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
must
know
where
he
is
,
my
dears
;
he
must
be
found
,
"
said
the
Jew
greatly
excited
.
 
<EOS>
"
Charley
,
do
nothing
but
skulk
about
,
till
you
bring
home
some
news
of
him
!
 
<EOS>
Nancy
,
my
dear
,
I
must
have
him
found
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
to
you
,
my
dear
,
---
to
you
and
the
Artful
for
everything
!
 
<EOS>
Stay
,
stay
,
"
added
the
Jew
,
unlocking
a
drawer
with
a
shaking
hand
;
"
there
's
money
,
my
dears
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
shut
up
this
shop
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
know
where
to
find
me
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
stop
here
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
Not
an
instant
,
my
dears
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
he
pushed
them
from
the
room
:
 
and
carefully
double
-
locking
and
barring
the
door
behind
them
,
drew
from
its
place
of
concealment
the
box
which
he
had
unintentionally
disclosed
to
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
hastily
proceeded
to
dispose
the
watches
and
jewellery
beneath
his
clothing
.
   
<EOS>
A
rap
at
the
door
startled
him
in
this
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
's
there
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
in
a
shrill
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Me
!
"
replied
the
voice
of
the
Dodger
,
through
the
key
-
hole
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
now
?
"
cried
the
Jew
impatiently
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
to
be
kidnapped
to
the
other
ken
,
Nancy
says
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
Dodger
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
the
Jew
,
"
wherever
she
lays
hands
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
Find
him
,
find
him
out
,
that
's
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
know
what
to
do
next
;
never
fear
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
boy
murmured
a
reply
of
intelligence
:
 
and
hurried
downstairs
after
his
companions
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
not
peached
so
far
,
"
said
the
Jew
as
he
pursued
his
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
he
means
to
blab
us
among
his
new
friends
,
we
may
stop
his
mouth
yet
.

<EOS>
Comprising
further
particulars
of
Oliver
's
stay
at
Mr
Brownlow
's
,
with
the
remarkable
prediction
which
one
Mr
Grimwig
uttered
concerning
him
,
when
he
went
out
on
an
errand
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
soon
recovering
from
the
fainting
-
fit
into
which
Mr
Brownlow
's
abrupt
exclamation
had
thrown
him
,
the
subject
of
the
picture
was
carefully
avoided
,
both
by
the
old
gentleman
and
Mrs
Bedwin
,
in
the
conversation
that
ensued
:
 
which
indeed
bore
no
reference
to
Oliver
's
history
or
prospects
,
but
was
confined
to
such
topics
as
might
amuse
without
exciting
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
still
too
weak
to
get
up
to
breakfast
;
but
,
when
he
came
down
into
the
housekeeper
's
room
next
day
,
his
first
act
was
to
cast
an
eager
glance
at
the
wall
,
in
the
hope
of
again
looking
on
the
face
of
the
beautiful
lady
.
 
<EOS>
His
expectations
were
disappointed
,
however
,
for
the
picture
had
been
removed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
housekeeper
,
watching
the
direction
of
Oliver
's
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
gone
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
is
ma'am
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
have
they
taken
it
away
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
taken
down
,
child
,
because
Mr
Brownlow
said
,
that
as
it
seemed
to
worry
you
,
perhaps
it
might
prevent
your
getting
well
,
you
know
,
"
rejoined
the
old
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
It
did
n't
worry
me
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Oliver
.
<EOS>
"
I
liked
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
quite
loved
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
!
"
said
the
old
lady
,
good
-
humouredly
;
<EOS>
"
you
get
well
as
fast
as
ever
you
can
,
dear
,
and
it
shall
be
hung
up
again
.
<EOS>
There
!
 
<EOS>
I
promise
you
that
!
 
<EOS>
Now
,
let
us
talk
about
something
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
all
the
information
Oliver
could
obtain
about
the
picture
at
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
old
lady
had
been
so
kind
to
him
in
his
illness
,
he
endeavoured
to
think
no
more
of
the
subject
just
then
;
so
he
listened
attentively
to
a
great
many
stories
she
told
him
,
about
an
amiable
and
handsome
daughter
of
hers
,
who
was
married
to
an
amiable
and
handsome
man
,
and
lived
in
the
country
;
and
about
a
son
,
who
was
clerk
to
a
merchant
in
the
West
Indies
;
and
who
was
,
also
,
such
a
good
young
man
,
and
wrote
such
dutiful
letters
home
four
times
a
-
year
,
that
it
brought
the
tears
into
her
eyes
to
talk
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
old
lady
had
expatiated
,
a
long
time
,
on
the
excellences
of
her
children
,
and
the
merits
of
her
kind
good
husband
besides
,
who
had
been
dead
and
gone
,
poor
dear
soul
!
<EOS>
just
six
-
and
-
twenty
years
,
it
was
time
to
have
tea
.
<EOS>
After
tea
she
began
to
teach
Oliver
cribbage
:
which
he
learnt
as
quickly
as
she
could
teach
:
 
and
at
which
game
they
played
,
with
great
interest
and
gravity
,
until
it
was
time
for
the
invalid
to
have
some
warm
wine
and
water
,
with
a
slice
of
dry
toast
,
and
then
to
go
cosily
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
happy
days
,
those
of
Oliver
's
recovery
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
was
so
quiet
,
and
neat
,
and
orderly
;
<EOS>
everybody
so
kind
and
gentle
;
that
after
the
noise
and
turbulence
in
the
midst
of
which
he
had
always
lived
,
it
seemed
like
Heaven
itself
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
no
sooner
strong
enough
to
put
his
clothes
on
,
properly
,
than
Mr
Brownlow
caused
a
complete
new
suit
,
and
a
new
cap
,
and
a
new
pair
of
shoes
,
to
be
provided
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
Oliver
was
told
that
he
might
do
what
he
liked
with
the
old
clothes
,
he
gave
them
to
a
servant
who
had
been
very
kind
to
him
,
and
asked
her
to
sell
them
to
a
Jew
,
and
keep
the
money
for
herself
.
 
<EOS>
This
she
very
readily
did
;
and
,
as
Oliver
looked
out
of
the
parlour
window
,
and
saw
the
Jew
roll
them
up
in
his
bag
and
walk
away
,
he
felt
quite
delighted
to
think
that
they
were
safely
gone
,
and
that
there
was
now
no
possible
danger
of
his
ever
being
able
to
wear
them
again
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
sad
rags
,
to
tell
the
truth
;
and
Oliver
had
never
had
a
new
suit
before
.
   
<EOS>
One
evening
,
about
a
week
after
the
affair
of
the
picture
,
as
he
was
sitting
talking
to
Mrs
Bedwin
,
there
came
a
message
down
from
Mr
Brownlow
,
that
if
Oliver
Twist
felt
pretty
well
,
he
should
like
to
see
him
in
his
study
,
and
talk
to
him
a
little
while
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
us
,
and
save
us
!
 
<EOS>
Wash
your
hands
,
and
let
me
part
your
hair
nicely
for
you
,
child
,
"
said
Mrs
Bedwin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
heart
alive
!
 
<EOS>
If
we
had
known
he
would
have
asked
for
you
,
we
would
have
put
you
a
clean
collar
on
,
and
made
you
as
smart
as
sixpence
!
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
did
as
the
old
lady
bade
him
;
and
,
although
she
lamented
grievously
,
meanwhile
,
that
there
was
not
even
time
to
crimp
the
little
frill
that
bordered
his
shirt
-
collar
;
he
looked
so
delicate
and
handsome
,
despite
that
important
personal
advantage
,
that
she
went
so
far
as
to
say
:
 
looking
at
him
with
great
complacency
from
head
to
foot
,
that
she
really
did
n't
think
it
would
have
been
possible
,
on
the
longest
notice
,
to
have
made
much
difference
in
him
for
the
better
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
encouraged
,
Oliver
tapped
at
the
study
door
.
 
<EOS>
On
Mr
Brownlow
calling
to
him
to
come
in
,
he
found
himself
in
a
little
back
room
,
quite
full
of
books
,
with
a
window
,
looking
into
some
pleasant
little
gardens
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
table
drawn
up
before
the
window
,
at
which
Mr
Brownlow
was
seated
reading
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
saw
Oliver
,
he
pushed
the
book
away
from
him
,
and
told
him
to
come
near
the
table
,
and
sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
complied
;
marvelling
where
the
people
could
be
found
to
read
such
a
great
number
of
books
as
seemed
to
be
written
to
make
the
world
wiser
.
 
<EOS>
Which
is
still
a
marvel
to
more
experienced
people
than
Oliver
Twist
,
every
day
of
their
lives
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
are
a
good
many
books
,
are
there
not
,
my
boy
?
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
observing
the
curiosity
with
which
Oliver
surveyed
the
shelves
that
reached
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
great
number
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
so
many
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
read
them
,
if
you
behave
well
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
kindly
;
"
and
you
will
like
that
,
better
than
looking
at
the
outsides
,
---
that
is
,
some
cases
;
because
there
are
books
of
which
the
backs
and
covers
are
by
far
the
best
parts
.
<EOS>
"

"
I
suppose
they
are
those
heavy
ones
,
sir
,
"
said
Oliver
,
pointing
to
some
large
quartos
,
with
a
good
deal
of
gilding
about
the
binding
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
always
those
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
patting
Oliver
on
the
head
,
and
smiling
as
he
did
so
;
"
there
are
other
equally
heavy
ones
,
though
of
a
much
smaller
size
.
 
<EOS>
How
should
you
like
to
grow
up
a
clever
man
,
and
write
books
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
would
rather
read
them
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
would
n't
you
like
to
be
a
book
-
writer
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
considered
a
little
while
;
and
at
last
said
,
he
should
think
it
would
be
a
much
better
thing
to
be
a
book
-
seller
;
upon
which
the
old
gentleman
laughed
heartily
,
and
declared
he
had
said
a
very
good
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Which
Oliver
felt
glad
to
have
done
,
though
he
by
no
means
knew
what
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
composing
his
features
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
afraid
!
 
<EOS>
We
wo
n't
make
an
author
of
you
,
while
there
's
an
honest
trade
to
be
learnt
,
or
brick
-
making
to
turn
to
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
earnest
manner
of
his
reply
,
the
old
gentleman
laughed
again
;
and
said
something
about
a
curious
instinct
,
which
Oliver
,
not
understanding
,
paid
no
very
great
attention
to
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
speaking
if
possible
in
a
kinder
,
but
at
the
same
time
in
a
much
more
serious
manner
,
than
Oliver
had
ever
known
him
assume
yet
,
"
I
want
you
to
pay
great
attention
,
my
boy
,
to
what
I
am
going
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
talk
to
you
without
any
reserve
;
because
I
am
sure
you
are
well
able
to
understand
me
,
as
many
older
persons
would
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
tell
you
are
going
to
send
me
away
,
sir
,
pray
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Oliver
,
alarmed
at
the
serious
tone
of
the
old
gentleman
's
commencement
!
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
turn
me
out
of
doors
to
wander
in
the
streets
again
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
stay
here
,
and
be
a
servant
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
send
me
back
to
the
wretched
place
I
came
from
.
 
<EOS>
Have
mercy
upon
a
poor
boy
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
child
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
moved
by
the
warmth
of
Oliver
's
sudden
appeal
;
"
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
my
deserting
you
,
unless
you
give
me
cause
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
,
never
will
,
sir
,
"
interposed
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
rejoined
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
you
ever
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
deceived
,
before
,
in
the
objects
whom
I
have
endeavoured
to
benefit
;
but
I
feel
strongly
disposed
to
trust
you
,
nevertheless
;
and
I
am
more
interested
in
your
behalf
than
I
can
well
account
for
,
even
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
The
persons
on
whom
I
have
bestowed
my
dearest
love
,
lie
deep
in
their
graves
;
but
,
although
the
happiness
and
delight
of
my
life
lie
buried
there
too
<EOS>
,
I
have
not
made
a
coffin
of
my
heart
,
and
sealed
it
up
,
forever
,
on
my
best
affections
.
 
<EOS>
Deep
affliction
has
but
strengthened
and
refined
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
old
gentleman
said
this
in
a
low
voice
:
 
more
to
himself
than
to
his
companion
:
 
and
as
he
remained
silent
for
a
short
time
afterwards
:
 
Oliver
sat
quite
still
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
"
said
the
old
gentleman
at
length
,
in
a
more
cheerful
tone
,
"
<EOS>
I
only
say
this
,
because
you
have
a
young
heart
;
and
knowing
that
I
have
suffered
great
pain
and
sorrow
,
you
will
be
more
careful
,
perhaps
,
not
to
wound
me
again
.
 
<EOS>
You
say
you
are
an
orphan
,
without
a
friend
in
the
world
;
all
the
inquiries
I
have
been
able
to
make
,
confirm
the
statement
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
hear
your
story
;
where
you
come
from
;
who
brought
you
up
;
and
how
you
got
into
the
company
in
which
I
found
you
.
 
<EOS>
Speak
the
truth
,
and
you
shall
not
be
friendless
while
I
live
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
's
sobs
checked
his
utterance
for
some
minutes
;
when
he
was
on
the
point
of
beginning
to
relate
how
he
had
been
brought
up
at
the
farm
,
and
carried
to
the
workhouse
by
Mr
Bumble
,
a
peculiarly
impatient
little
double
-
knock
was
heard
at
the
street
-
door
:
 
and
the
servant
,
running
upstairs
,
announced
Mr
Grimwig
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
coming
up
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Brownlow
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
servant
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
asked
if
there
were
any
muffins
in
the
house
;
and
,
when
I
told
him
yes
,
he
said
he
had
come
to
tea
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Brownlow
smiled
;
and
,
turning
to
Oliver
,
said
that
Mr
Grimwig
was
an
old
friend
of
his
,
and
he
must
not
mind
his
being
a
little
rough
in
his
manners
;
for
he
was
a
worthy
creature
at
bottom
,
as
he
had
reason
to
know
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
go
downstairs
,
sir
?
"
inquired
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Mr
Brownlow
,
"
I
would
rather
you
remained
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
there
walked
into
the
room
:
 
supporting
himself
by
a
thick
stick
:
 
<EOS>
a
stout
old
gentleman
,
rather
lame
in
one
leg
,
who
was
dressed
in
a
blue
coat
,
striped
waistcoat
,
nankeen
breeches
and
gaiters
,
and
a
broad
-
brimmed
white
hat
,
with
the
sides
turned
up
with
green
.
 
<EOS>
A
very
small
-
plaited
shirt
frill
stuck
out
from
his
waistcoat
;
and
a
very
long
steel
watch
-
chain
,
with
nothing
but
a
key
at
the
end
,
dangled
loosely
below
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
ends
of
his
white
neckerchief
were
twisted
into
a
ball
about
the
size
of
an
orange
;
the
variety
of
shapes
into
which
his
countenance
was
twisted
,
defy
description
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
manner
of
screwing
his
head
on
one
side
when
he
spoke
;
and
of
looking
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
at
the
same
time
:
 
which
irresistibly
reminded
the
beholder
of
a
parrot
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
attitude
,
he
fixed
himself
,
the
moment
he
made
his
appearance
;
and
,
holding
out
a
small
piece
of
orange
-
peel
at
arm
's
length
,
exclaimed
,
in
a
growling
,
discontented
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
here
!
<EOS>
do
you
see
this
!
 
<EOS>
Is
n't
it
a
most
wonderful
and
extraordinary
thing
that
I
ca
n't
call
at
a
man
's
house
<EOS>
but
I
find
a
piece
of
this
poor
surgeon
's
friend
on
the
staircase
?
<EOS>
I
've
been
lamed
with
orange
-
peel
once
,
and
I
know
orange
-
peel
will
be
my
death
,
or
I
'll
be
content
to
eat
my
own
head
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
the
handsome
offer
with
which
Mr
Grimwig
backed
and
confirmed
nearly
every
assertion
he
made
;
and
it
was
the
more
singular
in
his
case
,
because
,
even
admitting
for
the
sake
of
argument
,
the
possibility
of
scientific
improvements
being
brought
to
that
pass
which
will
enable
a
gentleman
to
eat
his
own
head
in
the
event
of
his
being
so
disposed
,
Mr
Grimwig
's
head
was
such
a
particularly
large
one
,
that
the
most
sanguine
man
alive
could
hardly
entertain
a
hope
of
being
able
to
get
through
it
at
a
sitting
---
to
put
entirely
out
of
the
question
,
a
very
thick
coating
of
powder
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
eat
my
head
,
sir
,
"
repeated
Mr
Grimwig
,
striking
his
stick
upon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hallo
!
<EOS>
what
's
that
!
"
<EOS>
looking
at
Oliver
,
and
retreating
a
pace
or
two
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
young
Oliver
Twist
,
whom
we
were
speaking
about
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
bowed
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
's
the
boy
who
had
the
fever
,
I
hope
?
"
said
Mr
Grimwig
,
recoiling
a
little
more
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wait
a
minute
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
speak
!
 
<EOS>
Stop
---
"
continued
Mr
Grimwig
,
abruptly
,
losing
all
dread
of
the
fever
in
his
triumph
at
the
discovery
;
"
that
's
the
boy
who
had
the
orange
!
 
<EOS>
If
that
's
not
the
boy
,
sir
,
who
had
the
orange
,
and
threw
this
bit
of
peel
upon
the
staircase
,
I
'll
eat
my
head
,
and
his
too
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
he
has
not
had
one
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Put
down
your
hat
;
and
speak
to
my
young
friend
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
feel
strongly
on
this
subject
,
sir
,
"
said
the
irritable
old
gentleman
,
drawing
off
his
gloves
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
always
more
or
less
orange
-
peel
on
the
pavement
in
our
street
;
and
I
KNOW
it
's
put
there
by
the
surgeon
's
boy
at
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
A
young
woman
stumbled
over
a
bit
last
night
,
and
fell
against
my
garden
-
railings
;
directly
she
got
up
<EOS>
I
saw
her
look
towards
his
infernal
red
lamp
with
the
pantomime
-
light
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
go
to
him
,
"
<EOS>
I
called
out
of
the
window
,
"
he
's
an
assassin
!
 
<EOS>
A
man
-
trap
!
"
 
<EOS>
So
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
is
not
---
"
 
Here
the
irascible
old
gentleman
gave
a
great
knock
on
the
ground
with
his
stick
;
which
was
always
understood
,
by
his
friends
,
to
imply
the
customary
offer
,
whenever
it
was
not
expressed
in
words
.
<EOS>
Then
,
still
keeping
his
stick
in
his
hand
,
he
sat
down
;
and
,
opening
a
double
eye
-
glass
,
which
he
wore
attached
to
a
broad
black
riband
,
took
a
view
of
Oliver
:
 
who
,
seeing
that
he
was
the
object
of
inspection
,
coloured
,
and
bowed
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
boy
,
is
it
?
"
said
Mr
Grimwig
,
at
length
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
boy
,
"
replied
Mr
Brownlow
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
,
boy
?
"
said
Mr
Grimwig
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
great
deal
better
,
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Brownlow
,
seeming
to
apprehend
that
his
singular
friend
was
about
to
say
something
disagreeable
,
asked
Oliver
to
step
downstairs
and
tell
Mrs
Bedwin
they
were
ready
for
tea
;
which
,
as
he
did
not
half
like
the
visitor
's
manner
,
he
was
very
happy
to
do
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
a
nice
-
looking
boy
,
is
he
not
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Brownlow
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
replied
Mr
Grimwig
,
pettishly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
know
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
any
difference
in
boys
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
knew
two
sort
of
boys
.
 
<EOS>
Mealy
boys
,
and
beef
-
faced
boys
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
which
is
Oliver
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mealy
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
a
friend
who
has
a
beef
-
faced
boy
;
a
fine
boy
<EOS>
,
they
call
him
;
with
a
round
head
,
and
red
cheeks
,
and
glaring
eyes
;
a
horrid
boy
;
with
a
body
and
limbs
that
appear
to
be
swelling
out
of
the
seams
of
his
blue
clothes
;
with
the
voice
of
a
pilot
,
and
the
appetite
of
a
wolf
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
him
!
 
<EOS>
The
wretch
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
"
these
are
not
the
characteristics
of
young
Oliver
Twist
;
so
he
need
n't
excite
your
wrath
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
are
not
,
"
replied
Mr
Grimwig
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
may
have
worse
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
,
Mr
Brownlow
coughed
impatiently
;
which
appeared
to
afford
Mr
Grimwig
the
most
exquisite
delight
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
may
have
worse
,
I
say
,
"
repeated
Mr
Grimwig
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
does
he
come
from
!
 
<EOS>
Who
is
he
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
he
?
 
<EOS>
He
has
had
a
fever
.
 
<EOS>
What
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
Fevers
are
not
peculiar
to
good
peope
;
are
they
?
 
<EOS>
Bad
people
have
fevers
sometimes
;
have
n't
they
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
I
knew
a
man
who
was
hung
in
Jamaica
for
murdering
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
had
a
fever
six
times
;
he
was
n't
recommended
to
mercy
on
that
account
.
 
<EOS>
Pooh
!
<EOS>
nonsense
!
"
   
<EOS>
Now
,
the
fact
was
,
that
in
the
inmost
recesses
of
his
own
heart
,
Mr
Grimwig
was
strongly
disposed
to
admit
that
Oliver
's
appearance
and
manner
were
unusually
prepossessing
;
but
he
had
a
strong
appetite
for
contradiction
,
sharpened
on
this
occasion
by
the
finding
of
the
orange
-
peel
;
and
,
inwardly
determining
that
no
man
should
dictate
to
him
whether
a
boy
was
well
-
looking
or
not
,
he
had
resolved
,
from
the
first
,
to
oppose
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
When
Mr
Brownlow
admitted
that
on
no
one
point
of
inquiry
could
he
yet
return
a
satisfactory
answer
;
and
that
he
had
postponed
any
investigation
into
Oliver
's
previous
history
until
he
thought
the
boy
was
strong
enough
to
hear
it
;
Mr
Grimwig
chuckled
maliciously
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
demanded
,
with
a
sneer
,
whether
the
housekeeper
was
in
the
habit
of
counting
the
plate
at
night
;
because
if
she
did
n't
find
a
table
-
spoon
or
two
missing
some
sunshiny
morning
,
why
,
he
would
be
content
to
---
and
so
forth
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
,
Mr
Brownlow
,
although
himself
somewhat
of
an
impetuous
gentleman
:
 
knowing
his
friend
's
peculiarities
,
bore
with
great
good
humour
;
as
Mr
Grimwig
,
at
tea
,
was
graciously
pleased
to
express
his
entire
approval
of
the
muffins
<EOS>
,
matters
went
on
very
smoothly
;
and
Oliver
,
who
made
one
of
the
party
,
began
to
feel
more
at
his
ease
than
he
had
yet
done
in
the
fierce
old
gentleman
's
presence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
are
you
going
to
hear
at
full
,
true
,
and
particular
account
of
the
life
and
adventures
of
Oliver
Twist
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Grimwig
of
Mr
Brownlow
,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
meal
;
looking
sideways
at
Oliver
,
as
he
resumed
his
subject
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
morning
,
"
replied
Mr
Brownlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
he
was
alone
with
me
at
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
Come
up
to
me
to
-
morrow
morning
at
ten
o'clock
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
He
answered
with
some
hesitation
,
because
he
was
confused
by
Mr
Grimwig
's
looking
so
hard
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
"
whispered
that
gentleman
to
Mr
Brownlow
;
"
he
wo
n't
come
up
to
you
to
-
morrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
him
hesitate
.
<EOS>
He
is
deceiving
you
,
my
good
friend
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
swear
he
is
not
,
"
replied
Mr
Brownlow
,
warmly
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
he
is
not
,
"
said
Mr
Grimwig
,
"
I
'll
---
"
and
down
went
the
stick
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
answer
for
that
boy
's
truth
with
my
life
!
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
knocking
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
for
his
falsehood
with
my
head
!
"
rejoined
Mr
Grimwig
,
knocking
the
table
also
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
checking
his
rising
anger
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
will
,
"
replied
Mr
Grimwig
,
with
a
provoking
smile
;
 
"
we
will
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
fate
would
have
it
,
Mrs
Bedwin
chanced
to
bring
in
,
at
this
moment
,
a
small
parcel
of
books
,
which
Mr
Brownlow
had
that
morning
purchased
of
the
identical
bookstall
-
keeper
,
who
has
already
figured
in
this
history
;
having
laid
them
on
the
table
,
she
prepared
to
leave
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
the
boy
,
Mrs
Bedwin
!
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
;
"
there
is
something
to
go
back
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
gone
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mrs
Bedwin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Call
after
him
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
;
<EOS>
"
it
's
particular
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
poor
man
,
and
they
are
not
paid
for
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
some
books
to
be
taken
back
,
too
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
street
-
door
was
opened
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
ran
one
way
;
and
the
girl
ran
another
;
and
Mrs
Bedwin
stood
on
the
step
and
screamed
for
the
boy
;
but
there
was
no
boy
in
sight
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
and
the
girl
returned
,
in
a
breathless
state
,
to
report
that
there
were
no
tidings
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
I
am
very
sorry
for
that
,
"
exclaimed
Mr
Brownlow
;
"
I
particularly
wished
those
books
to
be
returned
to
-
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Send
Oliver
with
them
,
"
said
Mr
Grimwig
,
with
an
ironical
smile
;
"
he
will
be
sure
to
deliver
them
safely
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
do
let
me
take
them
,
if
you
please
,
sir
,
"
said
Oliver
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
run
all
the
way
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
was
just
going
to
say
that
Oliver
should
not
go
out
on
any
account
;
when
a
most
malicious
cough
from
Mr
Grimwig
determined
him
that
he
should
;
and
that
,
by
his
prompt
discharge
of
the
commission
,
he
should
prove
to
him
the
injustice
of
his
suspicions
:
 
on
this
head
at
least
:
 
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
SHALL
go
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
books
are
on
a
chair
by
my
table
.
 
<EOS>
Fetch
them
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
,
delighted
to
be
of
use
,
brought
down
the
books
under
his
arm
in
a
great
bustle
;
and
waited
,
cap
in
hand
,
to
hear
what
message
he
was
to
take
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
to
say
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
glancing
steadily
at
Grimwig
;
"
you
are
to
say
that
you
have
brought
those
books
back
;
and
that
you
have
come
to
pay
the
four
pound
ten
I
owe
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
five
-
pound
note
,
so
you
will
have
to
bring
me
back
,
ten
shillings
change
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
be
ten
minutes
,
sir
,
"
said
Oliver
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
Having
buttoned
up
the
bank
-
note
in
his
jacket
pocket
,
and
placed
the
books
carefully
under
his
arm
,
he
made
a
respectful
bow
,
and
left
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Bedwin
followed
him
to
the
street
-
door
,
giving
him
many
directions
about
the
nearest
way
,
and
the
name
of
the
bookseller
,
and
the
name
of
the
street
:
 
all
of
which
Oliver
said
he
clearly
understood
.
 
<EOS>
Having
superadded
many
injunctions
to
be
sure
and
not
take
cold
,
the
old
lady
at
length
permitted
him
to
depart
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
his
sweet
face
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
old
lady
,
looking
after
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
bear
,
somehow
,
to
let
him
go
out
of
my
sight
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
Oliver
looked
gaily
round
,
and
nodded
before
he
turned
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
lady
smilingly
returned
his
salutation
,
and
,
closing
the
door
,
went
back
,
to
her
own
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
;
he
'll
be
back
in
twenty
minutes
,
at
the
longest
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
pulling
out
his
watch
,
and
placing
it
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
dark
by
that
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
really
expect
him
to
come
back
,
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Grimwig
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Mr
Brownlow
,
smiling
.
   
<EOS>
The
spirit
of
contradiction
was
strong
in
Mr
Grimwig
's
breast
,
at
the
moment
;
and
it
was
rendered
stronger
by
his
friend
's
confident
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
said
,
smiting
the
table
with
his
fist
,
"
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
The
boy
has
a
new
suit
of
clothes
on
his
back
,
a
set
of
valuable
books
under
his
arm
,
and
a
five
-
pound
note
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
He
'll
join
his
old
friends
the
thieves
,
and
laugh
at
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
ever
that
boy
returns
to
this
house
,
sir
,
I
'll
eat
my
head
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
he
drew
his
chair
closer
to
the
table
;
and
there
the
two
friends
sat
,
in
silent
expectation
,
with
the
watch
between
them
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
worthy
of
remark
,
as
illustrating
the
importance
we
attach
to
our
own
judgments
,
and
<EOS>
the
pride
with
which
we
put
forth
our
most
rash
and
hasty
conclusions
,
that
,
although
Mr
Grimwig
was
not
by
any
means
a
bad
-
hearted
man
,
and
though
he
would
have
been
unfeignedly
sorry
to
see
his
respected
friend
duped
and
deceived
,
he
really
did
most
earnestly
and
strongly
hope
at
that
moment
,
that
Oliver
Twist
might
not
come
back
.
   
<EOS>
It
grew
so
dark
,
that
the
figures
on
the
dial
-
plate
were
scarcely
discernible
;
but
there
the
two
old
gentlemen
continued
to
sit
,
in
silence
,
with
the
watch
between
them
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
15
.
<EOS>
Showing
how
very
fond
of
Oliver
Twist
,
the
merry
old
Jew
and
Miss
Nancy
were
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
obscure
parlour
of
a
low
public
-
house
,
in
the
filthiest
part
of
Little
Saffron
Hill
;
a
dark
and
gloomy
den
,
where
a
flaring
gas
-
light
burnt
all
day
in
the
winter
-
time
;
and
where
no
ray
of
sun
ever
shone
in
the
summer
:
 
there
sat
,
brooding
over
a
little
pewter
measure
and
a
small
glass
,
strongly
impregnated
with
the
smell
of
liquor
,
a
man
in
a
velveteen
coat
,
drab
shorts
,
half
-
boots
and
stockings
,
whom
even
by
that
dim
light
no
experienced
agent
of
the
police
would
have
hesitated
to
recognise
as
Mr
William
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
At
his
feet
,
sat
a
white
-
coated
,
red
-
eyed
dog
;
who
occupied
himself
,
alternately
,
in
winking
at
his
master
with
both
eyes
at
the
same
time
;
and
in
licking
a
large
,
fresh
cut
on
one
side
of
his
mouth
,
which
appeared
to
be
the
result
of
some
recent
conflict
.
   
<EOS>
"
Keep
quiet
,
you
warmint
!
 
<EOS>
Keep
quiet
!
"
said
Mr
Sikes
,
suddenly
breaking
silence
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
his
meditations
were
so
intense
as
to
be
disturbed
by
the
dog
's
winking
,
or
whether
his
feelings
were
so
wrought
upon
by
his
reflections
that
they
required
all
the
relief
derivable
from
kicking
an
unoffending
animal
to
allay
them
,
is
matter
for
argument
and
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
was
the
cause
,
the
effect
was
a
kick
and
a
curse
,
bestowed
upon
the
dog
simultaneously
.
   
<EOS>
Dogs
are
not
generally
apt
to
revenge
injuries
inflicted
upon
them
by
their
masters
;
but
Mr
Sikes
's
dog
,
having
faults
of
temper
in
common
with
his
owner
,
and
labouring
,
perhaps
,
at
this
moment
,
under
a
powerful
sense
of
injury
,
made
no
more
ado
but
at
once
fixed
his
teeth
in
one
of
the
half
-
boots
.
 
<EOS>
Having
given
in
a
hearty
shake
,
he
retired
,
growling
,
under
a
form
;
just
escaping
the
pewter
measure
which
Mr
Sikes
levelled
at
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
,
would
you
?
"
said
Sikes
,
seizing
the
poker
in
one
hand
,
and
deliberately
opening
with
the
other
a
large
clasp
-
knife
,
which
he
drew
from
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
here
,
you
born
devil
!
 
<EOS>
Come
here
!
 
<EOS>
D'ye
hear
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
dog
no
doubt
heard
;
because
Mr
Sikes
spoke
in
the
very
harshest
key
of
a
very
harsh
voice
;
but
,
appearing
to
entertain
some
unaccountable
objection
to
having
his
throat
cut
,
he
remained
where
he
was
,
and
growled
more
fiercely
than
before
:
 
at
the
same
time
grasping
the
end
of
the
poker
between
his
teeth
,
and
biting
at
it
like
a
wild
beast
.
   
<EOS>
This
resistance
only
infuriated
Mr
Sikes
the
more
;
who
,
dropping
on
his
knees
,
began
to
assail
the
animal
most
furiously
.
 
<EOS>
The
dog
jumped
from
right
to
left
,
and
from
left
to
right
;
snapping
,
growling
,
and
barking
;
the
man
thrust
and
swore
,
and
struck
and
blasphemed
;
and
the
struggle
was
reaching
a
most
critical
point
for
one
or
other
;
when
,
the
door
suddenly
opening
,
the
dog
darted
out
:
 
leaving
Bill
Sikes
with
the
poker
and
the
clasp
-
knife
in
his
hands
.
   
<EOS>
There
must
always
be
two
parties
to
a
quarrel
,
says
the
old
adage
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sikes
,
being
disappointed
of
the
dog
's
participation
,
at
once
transferred
his
share
in
the
quarrel
to
the
new
comer
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
do
you
come
in
between
me
and
my
dog
for
?
<EOS>
"
said
Sikes
,
with
a
fierce
gesture
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
,
my
dear
,
I
did
n't
know
,
"
replied
Fagin
,
humbly
;
for
the
Jew
was
the
new
comer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
know
,
you
white
-
livered
thief
!
"
<EOS>
growled
Sikes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Could
n't
you
hear
the
noise
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
sound
of
it
,
as
I
'm
a
living
man
,
Bill
,
"
replied
the
Jew
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
!
 
<EOS>
You
hear
nothing
,
you
do
n't
,
"
retorted
Sikes
with
a
fierce
sneer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sneaking
in
and
out
,
so
as
nobody
hears
how
you
come
or
go
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
had
been
the
dog
,
Fagin
,
half
a
minute
ago
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
inquired
the
Jew
with
a
forced
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
'Cause
the
government
,
as
cares
for
the
lives
of
such
men
as
you
,
as
have
n't
half
the
pluck
of
curs
,
lets
a
man
kill
a
dog
how
he
likes
,
"
replied
Sikes
,
shutting
up
the
knife
with
a
very
expressive
look
;
"
that
's
why
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
rubbed
his
hands
;
and
,
sitting
down
at
the
table
,
affected
to
laugh
at
the
pleasantry
of
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
obviously
very
ill
at
ease
,
however
.
   
<EOS>
"
Grin
away
,
"
said
Sikes
,
replacing
the
poker
,
and
surveying
him
with
savage
contempt
;
"
grin
away
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
never
have
the
laugh
at
me
,
though
,
unless
it
's
behind
a
nightcap
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
got
the
upper
hand
over
you
,
Fagin
;
and
<EOS>
,
d
---
 
me
,
<EOS>
I
'll
keep
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
go
,
you
go
;
so
take
care
of
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
"
I
know
all
that
;
we
---
we
---
have
a
mutual
interest
,
Bill
,
---
a
mutual
interest
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Humph
,
"
said
Sikes
,
as
if
he
though
the
interest
lay
rather
more
on
the
Jew
's
side
than
on
his
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
what
have
you
got
to
say
to
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
passed
safe
through
the
melting
-
pot
,
"
replied
Fagin
,
"
and
this
is
your
share
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
rather
more
than
it
ought
to
be
,
<EOS>
my
dear
;
<EOS>
but
as
I
know
you
'll
do
me
a
good
turn
another
time
,
and
---
"
   
"
Stow
that
gammon
,
"
interposed
the
robber
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
Hand
over
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
Bill
;
give
me
time
,
give
me
time
,
"
replied
the
Jew
,
soothingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
it
is
!
 
<EOS>
All
safe
!
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
drew
forth
an
old
cotton
handkerchief
from
his
breast
;
and
untying
a
large
knot
in
one
corner
,
produced
a
small
brown
-
paper
packet
.
 
<EOS>
Sikes
,
snatching
it
from
him
,
hastily
opened
it
;
and
proceeded
to
count
the
sovereigns
it
contained
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
all
,
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
,
"
replied
the
Jew
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
opened
the
parcel
and
swallowed
one
or
two
as
you
come
along
,
have
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sikes
,
suspiciously
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
put
on
an
injured
look
at
the
question
;
you
've
done
it
many
a
time
.
<EOS>
Jerk
the
tinkler
.
"
   
<EOS>
These
words
,
in
plain
English
,
conveyed
an
injunction
to
ring
the
bell
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
answered
by
another
Jew
:
 
younger
than
Fagin
,
but
nearly
as
vile
and
repulsive
in
appearance
.
   
<EOS>
Bill
Sikes
merely
pointed
to
the
empty
measure
.
 
<EOS>
The
Jew
,
perfectly
understanding
the
hint
,
retired
to
fill
it
:
 
previously
exchanging
a
remarkable
look
with
Fagin
,
who
raised
his
eyes
for
an
instant
,
as
if
in
expectation
of
it
,
and
shook
his
head
in
reply
;
so
slightly
that
the
action
would
have
been
almost
imperceptible
to
an
observant
third
person
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
lost
upon
Sikes
,
who
was
stooping
at
the
moment
to
tie
the
boot
-
lace
which
the
dog
had
torn
.
 
<EOS>
Possibly
,
if
he
had
observed
the
brief
interchange
of
signals
,
he
might
have
thought
that
it
boded
no
good
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
anybody
here
,
Barney
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Fagin
;
speaking
,
now
that
that
Sikes
was
looking
on
,
without
raising
his
eyes
from
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dot
a
shoul
,
"
replied
Barney
;
whose
words
:
 
whether
they
came
from
the
heart
or
not
:
 
made
their
way
through
the
nose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nobody
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Fagin
,
in
a
tone
of
surprise
:
 
which
perhaps
might
mean
that
Barney
was
at
liberty
to
tell
the
truth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dobody
but
Biss
Dadsy
,
"
replied
Barney
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nancy
!
"
exclaimed
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
?
 
<EOS>
Strike
me
blind
,
if
I
do
n't
honour
that
'
ere
girl
,
for
her
native
talents
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
's
bid
havid
a
plate
of
boiled
beef
<EOS>
i
d
the
bar
,
"
replied
Barney
.
   
<EOS>
"
Send
her
here
,
"
said
Sikes
,
pouring
out
a
glass
of
liquor
.
<EOS>
"
Send
her
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
Barney
looked
timidly
at
Fagin
,
as
if
for
permission
;
the
Jew
reamining
silent
,
and
not
lifting
his
eyes
from
the
ground
,
he
retired
;
and
presently
returned
,
ushering
in
Nancy
;
who
was
decorated
with
the
bonnet
,
apron
,
basket
,
and
street
-
door
key
,
complete
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
on
the
scent
,
are
you
,
Nancy
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sikes
,
proffering
the
glass
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
,
Bill
,
"
replied
the
young
lady
,
disposing
of
its
contents
;
"
and
tired
enough
of
it
I
am
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
brat
's
been
ill
and
confined
to
the
crib
;
and
---
"
   
"
Ah
,
Nancy
,
dear
!
"
said
Fagin
,
looking
up
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
whether
a
peculiar
contraction
of
the
Jew
's
red
eye
-
brows
,
and
a
half
closing
of
his
deeply
-
set
eyes
,
warned
Miss
Nancy
that
she
was
disposed
to
be
too
communicative
,
is
not
a
matter
of
much
importance
.
 
<EOS>
The
fact
is
all
we
need
care
for
here
;
and
the
fact
is
,
that
she
suddenly
checked
herself
,
and
with
several
gracious
smiles
upon
Mr
Sikes
,
turned
the
conversation
to
other
matters
.
<EOS>
In
about
ten
minutes
'
time
,
Mr
Fagin
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
coughing
;
upon
which
Nancy
pulled
her
shawl
over
her
shoulders
,
and
declared
it
was
time
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sikes
,
finding
that
he
was
walking
a
short
part
of
her
way
himself
,
expressed
his
intention
of
accompanying
her
;
they
went
away
together
,
followed
,
at
a
little
distant
,
by
the
dog
,
who
slunk
out
of
a
back
-
yard
as
soon
as
his
master
was
out
of
sight
.
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
room
door
when
Sikes
had
left
it
;
looked
after
him
as
we
walked
up
the
dark
passage
;
shook
his
clenched
fist
;
muttered
a
deep
curse
;
and
then
,
with
a
horrible
grin
,
reseated
himself
at
the
table
;
where
he
was
soon
deeply
absorbed
in
the
interesting
pages
of
the
Hue
-
and
-
Cry
.
   
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Oliver
Twist
,
little
dreaming
that
he
was
within
so
very
short
a
distance
of
the
merry
old
gentleman
,
was
on
his
way
to
the
book
-
stall
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
got
into
Clerkenwell
,
he
accidentally
turned
down
a
by
-
street
which
was
not
exactly
in
his
way
;
but
not
discovering
his
mistake
until
he
had
got
half
-
way
down
it
,
and
knowing
it
must
lead
in
the
right
direction
,
he
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
turn
back
;
and
so
marched
on
,
as
quickly
as
he
could
,
with
the
books
under
his
arm
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
walking
along
,
thinking
how
happy
and
contented
he
ought
to
feel
;
and
how
much
he
would
give
for
only
one
look
at
poor
little
Dick
,
who
,
starved
and
beaten
,
might
be
weeping
bitterly
at
that
very
moment
;
when
he
was
startled
by
a
young
woman
screaming
out
very
loud
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
brother
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
had
hardly
looked
up
,
to
see
what
the
matter
was
,
when
he
was
stopped
by
having
a
pair
of
arms
thrown
tight
round
his
neck
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
,
"
cried
Oliver
,
struggling
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
go
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
Who
is
it
?
<EOS>
What
are
you
stopping
me
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
only
reply
to
this
,
was
a
great
number
of
loud
lamentations
from
the
young
woman
who
had
embraced
him
;
and
who
had
a
little
basket
and
a
street
-
door
key
in
her
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
my
gracious
!
"
said
the
young
woman
,
"
I
have
found
him
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
Oliver
!
 
<EOS>
Oliver
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
<EOS>
you
naughty
boy
,
to
make
me
suffer
such
distress
on
your
account
!
 
<EOS>
Come
home
,
dear
,
come
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
've
found
him
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
gracious
goodness
heavins
<EOS>
,
I
've
found
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
With
these
incoherent
exclamations
,
the
young
woman
burst
into
another
fit
of
crying
,
and
got
so
dreadfully
hysterical
,
that
a
couple
of
women
who
came
up
at
the
moment
asked
a
butcher
's
boy
with
a
shiny
head
of
hair
anointed
with
suet
,
who
was
also
looking
on
,
whether
he
did
n't
think
he
had
better
run
for
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
To
which
,
the
butcher
's
boy
:
 
who
appeared
of
a
lounging
,
not
to
say
indolent
disposition
:
 
<EOS>
replied
,
that
he
thought
not
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
,
no
,
never
mind
,
"
said
the
young
woman
,
grasping
Oliver
's
hand
;
"
I
'm
better
now
.
 
<EOS>
Come
home
directly
,
you
cruel
boy
!
<EOS>
Come
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
the
young
woman
,
"
he
ran
away
,
near
a
month
ago
,
from
his
parents
,
who
are
hard
-
working
and
respectable
people
;
and
went
and
joined
a
set
of
thieves
and
bad
characters
;
and
almost
broke
his
mother
's
heart
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Young
wretch
!
"
said
one
woman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
home
,
do
,
you
little
brute
,
"
said
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
,
"
replied
Oliver
,
greatly
alarmed
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
any
sister
,
or
father
and
mother
either
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
an
orphan
;
I
live
at
Pentonville
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
hear
him
,
how
he
braves
it
out
!
"
cried
the
young
woman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
's
Nancy
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Oliver
;
who
now
saw
her
face
for
the
first
time
;
and
started
back
,
in
irrepressible
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
he
knows
me
!
"
cried
Nancy
,
appealing
to
the
bystanders
.
<EOS>
"
He
ca
n't
help
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Make
him
come
home
,
there
's
good
people
,
or
he
'll
kill
his
dear
mother
and
father
,
and
break
my
heart
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
's
this
?
"
said
a
man
,
bursting
out
of
a
beer
-
shop
,
with
a
white
dog
at
his
heels
;
"
young
Oliver
!
<EOS>
Come
home
to
your
poor
mother
,
you
young
dog
!
 
<EOS>
Come
home
directly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
belong
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
them
.
 
<EOS>
Help
!
<EOS>
help
!
<EOS>
cried
Oliver
,
struggling
in
the
man
's
powerful
grasp
.
   
<EOS>
"
Help
!
"
repeated
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
'll
help
you
,
you
young
rascal
!
   
<EOS>
What
books
are
these
?
 
<EOS>
You
've
been
a
stealing
'em
,
have
you
?
<EOS>
Give
'em
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
the
man
tore
the
volumes
from
his
grasp
,
and
struck
him
on
the
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
!
"
<EOS>
cried
a
looker
-
on
,
from
a
garret
-
window
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
only
way
of
bringing
him
to
his
senses
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
cried
a
sleepy
-
faced
carpenter
,
casting
an
approving
look
at
the
garret
-
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
'll
do
him
good
!
"
said
the
two
women
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
he
shall
have
it
,
too
!
"
<EOS>
rejoined
the
man
,
administering
another
blow
,
and
seizing
Oliver
by
the
collar
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
on
,
you
young
villain
!
 
<EOS>
Here
,
Bull's
-
eye
,
mind
him
,
boy
!
 
<EOS>
Mind
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
Weak
with
recent
illness
;
stupified
by
the
blows
and
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
;
terrified
by
the
fierce
growling
of
the
dog
,
and
the
brutality
of
the
man
;
overpowered
by
the
conviction
of
the
bystanders
that
he
really
was
the
hardened
little
wretch
he
was
described
to
be
;
what
could
one
poor
child
do
!
 
<EOS>
Darkness
had
set
in
;
it
was
a
low
neighborhood
;
no
help
was
near
;
resistance
was
useless
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
moment
he
was
dragged
into
a
labyrinth
of
dark
narrow
courts
,
and
was
forced
along
them
at
a
pace
which
rendered
the
few
cries
he
dared
to
give
utterance
to
,
unintelligible
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
of
little
moment
,
indeed
,
whether
they
were
intelligible
or
no
;
for
there
was
nobody
to
care
for
them
,
<EOS>
had
they
been
ever
so
plain
.
   
<EOS>
The
gas
-
lamps
were
lighted
;
Mrs
Bedwin
was
waiting
anxiously
at
the
open
door
;
the
servant
had
run
up
the
street
twenty
times
to
see
if
there
were
any
traces
of
Oliver
;
and
still
the
two
old
gentlemen
sat
,
perseveringly
,
in
the
dark
parlour
,
with
the
watch
between
them
.
    
Chapter
16
.
<EOS>
Relates
what
became
of
Oliver
Twist
,
after
he
had
been
claimed
by
Nancy
.
 
<EOS>
The
narrow
streets
and
courts
,
at
length
,
terminated
in
a
large
open
space
;
scattered
about
which
,
were
pens
for
beasts
,
and
other
indications
of
a
cattle
-
market
.
 
<EOS>
Sikes
slackened
his
pace
when
they
reached
this
spot
:
 
the
girl
being
quite
unable
to
support
any
longer
,
the
rapid
rate
at
which
they
had
hitherto
walked
.
 
<EOS>
Turning
to
Oliver
,
he
roughly
commanded
him
to
take
hold
of
Nancy
's
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
?
<EOS>
"
growled
Sikes
,
as
Oliver
hesitated
,
and
looked
round
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
in
a
dark
corner
,
quite
out
of
the
track
of
passengers
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
saw
,
but
too
plainly
,
that
resistance
would
be
of
no
avail
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
out
his
hand
,
which
Nancy
clasped
tight
in
hers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Give
me
the
other
,
"
said
Sikes
,
seizing
Oliver
's
unoccupied
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
Bull's
-
Eye
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
dog
looked
up
,
and
growled
.
   
<EOS>
"
See
here
,
boy
!
"
<EOS>
said
Sikes
,
putting
his
other
hand
to
Oliver
's
throat
;
"
if
he
speaks
ever
so
soft
a
word
,
hold
him

<EOS>
D'ye
mind
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
dog
growled
again
;
and
licking
his
lips
,
eyed
Oliver
as
if
he
were
anxious
to
attach
himself
to
his
windpipe
without
delay
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
as
willing
as
a
Christian
,
strike
me
blind
if
he
is
n't
!
"
<EOS>
said
Sikes
,
regarding
the
animal
with
a
kind
of
grim
and
ferocious
approval
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
you
know
what
you
've
got
to
expect
,
master
,
so
call
away
as
quick
as
you
like
;
the
dog
will
soon
stop
that
game
.
 
<EOS>
Get
on
,
young'un
!
"
   
<EOS>
Bull's
-
eye
wagged
his
tail
in
acknowledgment
of
this
unusually
endearing
form
of
speech
;
and
,
giving
vent
to
another
admonitory
growl
for
the
benefit
of
Oliver
,
led
the
way
onward
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
Smithfield
that
they
were
crossing
,
although
it
might
have
been
Grosvenor
Square
,
for
anything
Oliver
knew
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
dark
and
foggy
.
 
<EOS>
The
lights
in
the
shops
could
scarcely
struggle
through
the
heavy
mist
,
which
thickened
every
moment
and
shrouded
the
streets
and
houses
in
gloom
;
rendering
the
strange
place
still
stranger
in
Oliver
's
eyes
;
and
making
his
uncertainty
the
more
dismal
and
depressing
.
   
<EOS>
They
had
hurried
on
a
few
paces
,
when
a
deep
church
-
bell
struck
the
hour
.
 
<EOS>
With
its
first
stroke
,
his
two
conductors
stopped
,
and
turned
their
heads
in
the
direction
<EOS>
whence
the
sound
proceeded
.
   
<EOS>
"
Eight
o'clock
,
Bill
,
"
said
Nancy
,
when
the
bell
ceased
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
good
of
telling
me
that
;
I
can
hear
it
,
ca
n't
I
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
THEY
can
hear
it
,
"
said
Nancy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
they
can
,
"
replied
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
Bartlemy
time
when
I
was
shopped
;
and
there
warn't
<EOS>
a
penny
trumpet
in
the
fair
,
as
I
could
n't
hear
the
squeaking
on
.
 
<EOS>
Arter
I
was
locked
up
for
the
night
,
the
row
and
din
outside
made
the
thundering
old
jail
so
silent
,
that
I
could
almost
have
beat
my
brains
out
against
the
iron
plates
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
"
said
Nancy
,
who
still
had
her
face
turned
towards
the
quarter
in
which
the
bell
had
sounded
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Bill
,
such
fine
young
chaps
as
them
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
that
's
all
you
women
think
of
,
"
answered
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fine
young
chaps
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
they
're
as
good
as
dead
,
so
it
do
n't
much
matter
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
consolation
,
Mr
Sikes
appeared
to
repress
a
rising
tendency
to
jealousy
,
and
,
clasping
Oliver
's
wrist
more
firmly
,
told
him
to
step
out
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wait
a
minute
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
girl
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
hurry
by
,
if
it
was
you
that
was
coming
out
to
be
hung
,
the
next
time
eight
o'clock
struck
,
Bill
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
walk
round
and
round
the
place
till
I
dropped
,
if
the
snow
was
on
the
ground
,
and
I
had
n't
a
shawl
to
cover
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
good
would
that
do
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
unsentimental
Mr
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Unless
you
could
pitch
over
a
file
and
twenty
yards
of
good
stout
rope
,
you
might
as
well
be
walking
fifty
mile
off
,
or
not
walking
at
all
,
for
all
the
good
it
would
do
me
.
 
<EOS>
Come
on
,
and
do
n't
stand
preaching
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
girl
burst
into
a
laugh
;
drew
her
shawl
more
closely
round
her
;
and
they
walked
away
.
 
<EOS>
But
Oliver
felt
her
hand
tremble
,
and
,
looking
up
in
her
face
as
they
passed
a
gas
-
lamp
,
saw
that
it
had
turned
a
deadly
white
.
   
<EOS>
They
walked
on
,
by
little
-
frequented
and
dirty
ways
,
for
a
full
half
-
hour
:
 
<EOS>
meeting
very
few
people
,
and
those
appearing
from
their
looks
to
hold
much
the
same
position
in
society
as
Mr
Sikes
himself
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
they
turned
into
a
very
filthy
narrow
street
,
nearly
full
of
old
-
clothes
shops
;
the
dog
running
forward
,
as
if
conscious
that
there
was
no
further
occasion
for
his
keeping
on
guard
,
stopped
before
the
door
of
a
shop
that
was
closed
and
apparently
untenanted
;
the
house
was
in
a
ruinous
condition
,
and
on
the
door
was
nailed
a
board
,
intimating
that
it
was
to
let
:
 
which
looked
as
if
it
had
hung
there
for
many
years
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
"
cried
Sikes
,
glancing
cautiously
about
.
   
<EOS>
Nancy
stooped
below
the
shutters
,
and
Oliver
heard
the
sound
of
a
bell
.
 
<EOS>
They
crossed
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
,
and
stood
for
a
few
moments
under
a
lamp
.
 
<EOS>
A
noise
,
as
if
a
sash
window
were
gently
raised
,
was
heard
;
and
soon
afterwards
the
door
softly
opened
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sikes
then
seized
the
terrified
boy
by
the
collar
with
very
little
ceremony
;
and
all
three
were
quickly
inside
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
The
passage
was
perfectly
dark
.
 
<EOS>
They
waited
,
while
the
person
who
had
let
them
in
,
chained
and
barred
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Anybody
here
?
"
inquired
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
a
voice
,
which
Oliver
thought
he
had
heard
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
the
old
'
un
here
?
"
asked
the
robber
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
the
voice
,
"
and
precious
down
in
the
mouth
he
has
been
.
 
<EOS>
Wo
n't
he
be
glad
to
see
you
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
style
of
this
reply
,
as
well
as
the
voice
which
delivered
it
,
seemed
familiar
to
Oliver
's
ears
:
 
but
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
even
the
form
of
the
speaker
in
the
darkness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
's
have
a
glim
,
"
said
Sikes
,
"
or
we
shall
go
breaking
our
necks
,
or
treading
on
the
dog
.
 
<EOS>
Look
after
your
legs
if
you
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stand
still
a
moment
,
and
I
'll
get
you
one
,
"
replied
the
voice
.
<EOS>
The
receding
footsteps
of
the
speaker
were
heard
;
and
,
in
another
minute
,
the
form
of
Mr
John
Dawkins
,
otherwise
the
Artful
Dodger
,
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
He
bore
in
his
right
hand
a
tallow
candle
stuck
in
the
end
of
a
cleft
stick
.
   
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
did
not
stop
to
bestow
any
other
mark
of
recognition
upon
Oliver
than
a
humourous
grin
;
but
,
turning
away
,
beckoned
the
visitors
to
follow
him
down
a
flight
of
stairs
.
<EOS>
They
crossed
an
empty
kitchen
;
and
,
opening
the
door
of
a
low
earthy
-
smelling
room
,
which
seemed
to
have
been
built
in
a
small
back
-
yard
,
were
received
with
a
shout
of
laughter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
wig
,
my
wig
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Master
Charles
Bates
,
from
whose
lungs
the
laughter
had
proceeded
:
 
"
here
he
is
!
<EOS>
oh
,
cry
,
here
he
is
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Fagin
,
look
at
him
!
 
<EOS>
Fagin
,
do
look
at
him
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
it
;
it
is
such
a
jolly
game
,
I
ca
nt
"
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
Hold
me
,
somebody
,
while
I
laugh
it
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
irrepressible
ebullition
of
mirth
,
Master
Bates
laid
himself
flat
on
the
floor
:
and
kicked
convulsively
for
five
minutes
,
in
an
ectasy
of
facetious
joy
.
 
<EOS>
Then
jumping
to
his
feet
,
he
snatched
the
cleft
stick
from
the
Dodger
;
and
,
advancing
to
Oliver
,
viewed
him
round
and
round
;
while
the
Jew
,
taking
off
his
nightcap
,
made
a
great
number
of
low
bows
to
the
bewildered
boy
.
 
<EOS>
The
Artful
,
meantime
,
who
was
of
a
rather
saturnine
disposition
,
and
seldom
gave
way
to
merriment
when
it
interfered
with
business
,
rifled
Oliver
's
pockets
with
steady
assiduity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
at
his
togs
,
Fagin
!
"
said
Charley
,
putting
the
light
so
close
to
his
new
jacket
as
nearly
to
set
him
on
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
at
his
togs
!
 
<EOS>
Superfine
cloth
,
and
the
heavy
swell
cut
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
eye
,
what
a
game
!
 
<EOS>
And
his
books
,
too
!
 
<EOS>
Nothing
but
a
gentleman
,
Fagin
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Delighted
to
see
you
looking
so
well
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
bowing
with
mock
humility
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Artful
shall
give
you
another
suit
,
my
dear
,
<EOS>
for
fear
you
should
spoil
that
Sunday
one
.
 
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
you
write
,
my
dear
,
and
say
you
were
coming
?
 
<EOS>
We
'd
have
got
something
warm
for
supper
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
his
,
Master
Bates
roared
again
:
so
loud
,
that
Fagin
himself
relaxed
,
and
even
the
Dodger
smiled
;
but
as
the
Artful
drew
forth
the
five
-
pound
note
at
that
instant
,
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
sally
of
the
discovery
awakened
his
merriment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hallo
,
what
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sikes
,
stepping
forward
as
the
Jew
seized
the
note
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
mine
,
Fagin
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
Jew
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mine
,
Bill
,
mine
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
have
the
books
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
that
ai
n't
mine
!
"
said
Bill
Sikes
,
putting
on
his
hat
with
a
determined
air
;
"
mine
and
Nancy
's
that
is
<EOS>
;
I
'll
take
the
boy
back
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
started
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
started
too
,
though
from
a
very
different
cause
;
for
he
hoped
that
the
dispute
might
really
end
in
his
being
taken
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Hand
over
,
will
you
?
"
said
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
hardly
fair
,
Bill
;
hardly
fair
,
is
it
,
Nancy
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
Jew
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fair
,
or
not
fair
,
"
retorted
Sikes
,
"
hand
over
,
I
tell
you
!
<EOS>
Do
you
think
Nancy
and
me
has
got
nothing
else
to
do
with
our
precious
time
but
to
spend
it
in
scouting
arter
,
and
kidnapping
,
every
young
boy
as
gets
grabbed
through
you
?
 
<EOS>
Give
it
here
,
you
avaricious
old
skeleton
,
give
it
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
gentle
remonstrance
,
Mr
Sikes
plucked
the
note
from
between
the
Jew
's
finger
and
thumb
;
and
looking
the
old
man
coolly
in
the
face
,
folded
it
up
small
,
and
tied
it
in
his
neckerchief
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
for
our
share
of
the
trouble
,
"
said
Sikes
;
"
and
not
half
enough
,
neither
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
keep
the
books
,
if
you
're
fond
of
reading
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
ai
n't
,
sell
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
're
very
pretty
,
"
said
Charley
Bates
:
who
,
with
sundry
grimaces
,
had
been
affecting
to
read
one
of
the
volumes
in
question
;
"
beautiful
writing
,
is
n't
is
,
Oliver
?
"
 
<EOS>
At
sight
of
the
dismayed
look
with
which
Oliver
regarded
his
tormentors
,
Master
Bates
,
who
was
blessed
with
a
lively
sense
of
the
ludicrous
,
fell
into
another
ectasy
,
more
boisterous
than
the
first
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
belong
to
the
old
gentleman
,
"
said
Oliver
,
wringing
his
hands
;
"
to
the
good
,
kind
,
old
gentleman
who
took
me
into
his
house
,
and
had
me
nursed
,
when
I
was
near
dying
of
the
fever
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
pray
send
them
back
;
send
him
back
the
books
and
money
.
 
<EOS>
Keep
me
here
all
my
life
long
;
but
pray
,
pray
send
them
back
.
 
<EOS>
He
'll
think
I
stole
them
;
the
old
lady
:
 
all
of
them
who
were
so
kind
to
me
:
will
think
I
stole
them
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
do
have
mercy
upon
me
,
and
send
them
back
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
which
were
uttered
with
all
the
energy
of
passionate
grief
,
Oliver
fell
upon
his
knees
at
the
Jew
's
feet
;
and
beat
his
hands
together
,
in
perfect
desperation
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
boy
's
right
,
"
remarked
Fagin
,
looking
covertly
round
,
and
knitting
his
shaggy
eyebrows
into
a
hard
knot
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
right
<EOS>
,
Oliver
,
you
're
right
;
they
WILL
think
you
have
stolen
'em
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
"
chuckled
the
Jew
,
rubbing
his
hands
,
"
it
could
n't
have
happened
better
,
if
we
had
chosen
our
time
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
could
n't
,
"
replied
Sikes
;
"
I
know'd
<EOS>
that
,
directly
I
see
him
coming
through
Clerkenwell
,
with
the
books
under
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
right
enough
.
 
<EOS>
They
're
soft
-
hearted
psalm
-
singers
,
or
they
would
n't
have
taken
him
in
at
all
;
and
they
'll
ask
no
questions
after
him
,
fear
they
should
be
obliged
to
prosecute
,
and
so
get
him
lagged
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
safe
enough
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
had
looked
from
one
to
the
other
,
while
these
words
were
being
spoken
,
as
if
he
were
bewildered
,
and
could
scarcely
understand
what
passed
;
but
when
Bill
Sikes
concluded
,
he
jumped
suddenly
to
his
feet
,
and
tore
wildly
from
the
room
:
 
uttering
shrieks
for
help
,
which
made
the
bare
old
house
echo
to
the
roof
.
   
<EOS>
"
Keep
back
the
dog
,
Bill
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Nancy
,
springing
before
the
door
,
and
closing
it
,
as
the
Jew
and
his
two
pupils
darted
out
in
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Keep
back
the
dog
;
he
'll
tear
the
boy
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Serve
him
right
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sikes
,
struggling
to
disengage
himself
from
the
girl
's
grasp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stand
off
from
me
,
or
I
'll
split
your
head
against
the
wall
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
for
that
,
Bill
,
I
do
n't
care
for
that
,
"
screamed
the
girl
,
struggling
violently
with
the
man
,
"
the
child
sha
n't
be
torn
down
by
the
dog
,
unless
you
kill
me
first
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sha
n't
he
!
"
said
Sikes
,
setting
his
teeth
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
soon
do
that
,
if
you
do
n't
keep
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
housebreaker
flung
the
girl
from
him
to
the
further
end
of
the
room
,
just
as
the
Jew
and
the
two
boys
returned
,
dragging
Oliver
among
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
here
!
"
said
Fagin
,
looking
round
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
girl
's
gone
mad
,
I
think
,
"
replied
Sikes
,
savagely
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
she
has
n't
,
"
said
Nancy
,
pale
and
breathless
from
the
scuffle
;
"
no
,
she
has
n't
,
Fagin
;
do
n't
think
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
keep
quiet
,
will
you
?
"
said
the
Jew
,
with
a
threatening
look
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
wo
n't
do
that
,
neither
,
"
replied
Nancy
,
speaking
very
loud
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
!
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Fagin
was
sufficiently
well
acquainted
with
the
manners
and
customs
of
that
particular
species
of
humanity
to
which
Nancy
belonged
,
to
feel
tolerably
certain
that
it
would
be
rather
unsafe
to
prolong
any
conversation
with
her
,
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
view
of
diverting
the
attention
of
the
company
,
he
turned
to
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
you
wanted
to
get
away
,
my
dear
,
did
you
?
"
said
the
Jew
,
taking
up
a
jagged
and
knotted
club
which
law
in
a
corner
of
the
fireplace
;
"
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
made
no
reply
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
watched
the
Jew
's
motions
,
and
breathed
quickly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wanted
to
get
assistance
;
called
for
the
police
;
did
you
?
"
<EOS>
sneered
the
Jew
,
catching
the
boy
by
the
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
'll
cure
you
of
that
,
my
young
master
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
inflicted
a
smart
blow
on
Oliver
's
shoulders
with
the
club
;
and
was
raising
it
for
a
second
,
when
the
girl
,
rushing
forward
,
wrested
it
from
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
She
flung
it
into
the
fire
,
with
a
force
that
brought
some
of
the
glowing
coals
whirling
out
into
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
stand
by
and
see
it
done
,
Fagin
,
"
cried
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
got
the
boy
,
and
what
more
would
you
have
?
---
Let
him
be
---
let
him
be
---
or
I
shall
put
that
mark
on
some
of
you
,
that
will
bring
me
to
the
gallows
before
my
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
girl
stamped
her
foot
violently
on
the
floor
as
she
vented
this
threat
;
and
with
her
lips
compressed
,
and
her
hands
clenched
,
looked
alternately
at
the
Jew
and
the
other
robber
:
<EOS>
her
face
quite
colourless
from
the
passion
of
rage
into
which
she
had
gradually
worked
herself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Nancy
!
"
said
the
Jew
,
in
a
soothing
tone
;
after
a
pause
,
during
which
he
and
Mr
Sikes
had
stared
at
one
another
in
a
disconcerted
manner
;
"
you
,
---
you
're
more
clever
than
ever
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
you
are
acting
beautifully
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Am
I
!
"
said
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
care
<EOS>
I
do
n't
overdo
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
the
worse
for
it
,
Fagin
,
if
I
do
;
and
so
I
tell
you
in
good
time
to
keep
clear
of
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
is
something
about
a
roused
woman
:
especially
if
she
add
to
all
her
other
strong
passions
,
the
fierce
impulses
of
recklessness
and
despair
;
which
few
men
like
to
provoke
.
<EOS>
The
Jew
saw
that
it
would
be
hopeless
to
affect
any
further
mistake
regarding
the
reality
of
Miss
Nancy
's
rage
;
and
,
shrinking
involuntarily
back
a
few
paces
,
cast
a
glance
,
half
imploring
and
half
cowardly
,
at
Sikes
:
as
if
to
hint
that
he
was
the
fittest
person
to
pursue
the
dialogue
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sikes
,
thus
mutely
appealed
to
;
and
possibly
feeling
his
personal
pride
and
influence
interested
in
the
immediate
reduction
of
Miss
Nancy
to
reason
;
gave
utterance
to
about
a
couple
of
score
of
curses
and
threats
,
the
rapid
production
of
which
reflected
great
credit
on
the
fertility
of
his
invention
.
<EOS>
As
they
produced
no
visible
effect
on
the
object
against
whom
they
were
discharged
,
however
,
he
resorted
to
more
tangible
arguments
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
this
?
"
said
Sikes
;
backing
the
inquiry
with
a
very
common
imprecation
concerning
the
most
beautiful
of
human
features
:
which
,
if
it
were
heard
above
,
only
once
out
of
every
fifty
thousand
times
that
it
is
uttered
below
,
would
render
blindness
as
common
a
disorder
as
measles
:
"
what
do
you
mean
by
it
?
 
<EOS>
Burn
my
body
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
who
you
are
,
and
what
you
are
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
I
know
all
about
it
,
"
replied
the
girl
,
laughing
hysterically
;
and
shaking
her
head
from
side
to
side
,
with
a
poor
assumption
of
indifference
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
keep
quiet
,
"
rejoined
Sikes
,
with
a
growl
like
that
he
was
accustomed
to
use
when
addressing
his
dog
,
"
or
I
'll
quiet
you
for
a
good
long
time
to
come
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
girl
laughed
again
:
even
less
composedly
than
before
;
and
,
darting
a
hasty
look
at
Sikes
,
turned
her
face
aside
,
and
bit
her
lip
till
the
blood
came
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
nice
one
,
"
added
Sikes
,
as
he
surveyed
her
with
a
contemptuous
air
,
"
to
take
up
the
humane
and
gen
---
teel
side
!
 
<EOS>
A
pretty
subject
for
the
child
,
as
you
call
him
,
to
make
a
friend
of
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
God
Almighty
help
me
,
I
am
!
"
cried
the
girl
passionately
;
"
and
I
wish
I
had
been
struck
dead
in
the
street
,
or
had
changed
places
with
them
<EOS>
we
passed
so
near
to
-
night
,
before
I
had
lent
a
hand
in
bringing
him
here
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
a
thief
,
a
liar
,
a
devil
,
all
that
's
bad
,
from
this
night
forth
.
 
<EOS>
Is
n't
that
enough
for
the
old
wretch
,
without
blows
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Come
,
come
,
Sikes
,
"
said
the
Jew
appealing
to
him
in
a
remonstratory
tone
,
and
motioning
towards
the
boys
,
who
were
eagerly
attentive
to
all
that
passed
;
"
we
must
have
civil
words
;
civil
words
,
Bill
.
"
   
"
Civil
words
!
"
cried
the
girl
,
whose
passion
was
frightful
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
"
Civil
words
,
you
villain
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
you
deserve
'em
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
thieved
for
you
when
I
was
a
child
not
half
as
old
as
this
!
"
<EOS>
pointing
to
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
in
the
same
trade
,
and
in
the
same
service
,
for
twelve
years
since
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
it
?
 
<EOS>
Speak
out
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
replied
the
Jew
,
with
an
attempt
at
pacification
;
"
and
,
if
you
have
,
it
's
your
living
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
it
is
!
"
returned
the
girl
;
not
speaking
,
but
pouring
out
the
words
in
one
continuous
and
vehement
scream
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
living
;
and
the
cold
,
wet
,
dirty
streets
are
my
home
;
and
you
're
the
wretch
that
drove
me
to
them
long
ago
,
and
that
'll
keep
me
there
,
day
and
night
,
day
and
night
,
till
I
die
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
do
you
a
mischief
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
the
Jew
,
goaded
by
these
reproaches
;
"
a
mischief
worse
than
that
,
if
you
say
much
more
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
girl
said
nothing
more
;
but
,
tearing
her
hair
and
dress
in
a
transport
of
passion
,
made
such
a
rush
at
the
Jew
as
would
probably
have
left
signal
marks
of
her
revenge
upon
him
,
had
not
her
wrists
been
seized
by
Sikes
at
the
right
moment
;
upon
which
,
she
made
a
few
ineffectual
struggles
,
and
fainted
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
's
all
right
now
,
"
said
Sikes
,
laying
her
down
in
a
corner
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
uncommon
strong
in
the
arms
,
when
she
's
up
in
this
way
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
wiped
his
forehead
:
and
smiled
,
as
if
it
were
a
relief
to
have
the
disturbance
over
;
but
neither
he
,
nor
Sikes
,
nor
the
dog
,
nor
the
boys
,
seemed
to
consider
it
in
any
other
light
than
a
common
occurance
incidental
to
business
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
worst
of
having
to
do
with
women
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
replacing
his
club
;
"
but
they
're
clever
,
and
we
ca
n't
get
on
,
in
our
line
,
without
'em
.
 
<EOS>
Charley
,
show
Oliver
to
bed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
'd
better
not
wear
his
best
clothes
tomorrow
,
Fagin
,
had
he
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Charley
Bates
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
replied
the
Jew
,
reciprocating
the
grin
with
which
Charley
put
the
question
.
   
<EOS>
Master
Bates
,
apparently
much
delighted
with
his
commission
,
took
the
cleft
stick
:
and
led
Oliver
into
an
adjacent
kitchen
,
where
there
were
two
or
three
of
the
beds
on
which
he
had
slept
before
;
and
here
,
with
many
uncontrollable
bursts
of
laughter
,
he
produced
the
identical
old
suit
of
clothes
which
Oliver
had
so
much
congratulated
himself
upon
leaving
off
at
Mr
Brownlow
's
;
and
the
accidental
display
of
which
,
to
Fagin
,
by
the
Jew
who
purchased
them
,
had
been
the
very
first
clue
received
,
of
his
whereabout
.
   
<EOS>
"
Put
off
the
smart
ones
,
"
said
Charley
,
"
and
I
'll
give
'em
to
Fagin
to
take
care
of
<EOS>
.
 
<EOS>
What
fun
it
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
Poor
Oliver
unwillingly
complied
.
 
<EOS>
Master
Bates
rolling
up
the
new
clothes
under
his
arm
,
departed
from
the
room
,
leaving
Oliver
in
the
dark
,
and
locking
the
door
behind
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
noise
of
Charley
's
laughter
,
and
the
voice
of
Miss
Betsy
,
who
opportunely
arrived
to
throw
water
over
her
friend
,
and
perform
other
feminine
offices
for
the
promotion
of
her
recovery
,
might
have
kept
many
people
awake
under
more
happy
circumstances
than
those
in
which
Oliver
was
placed
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
sick
and
weary
;
and
he
soon
fell
sound
asleep
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
17
.
<EOS>
Oliver
's
destiny
continuing
unpropitious
,
brings
a
great
man
to
London
to
injure
his
reputation
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
custom
on
the
stage
,
in
all
good
murderous
melodramas
,
to
present
the
tragic
and
the
comic
scenes
,
in
as
regular
alternation
,
as
the
layers
of
red
and
white
in
a
side
of
streaky
bacon
.
 
<EOS>
The
hero
sinks
upon
his
straw
bed
,
weighed
down
by
fetters
and
misfortunes
;
in
the
next
scene
,
his
faithful
but
unconscious
squire
regales
the
audience
with
a
comic
song
.
 
<EOS>
We
behold
,
with
throbbing
bosoms
,
the
heroine
in
the
grasp
of
a
proud
and
ruthless
baron
:
her
virtue
and
her
life
alike
in
danger
,
drawing
forth
her
dagger
to
preserve
the
one
at
the
cost
of
the
other
;
and
just
as
our
expectations
are
wrought
up
to
the
highest
pitch
,
a
whistle
is
heard
,
and
we
are
straightway
transported
to
the
great
hall
of
the
castle
;
where
a
grey
-
headed
seneschal
sings
a
funny
chorus
with
a
funnier
body
of
vassals
,
who
are
free
of
all
sorts
of
places
,
from
church
vaults
to
palaces
,
and
roam
about
in
company
,
carolling
perpetually
.
   
<EOS>
Such
changes
appear
absurd
;
but
they
are
not
so
unnatural
as
they
would
seem
at
first
sight
.
 
<EOS>
The
transitions
in
real
life
from
well
-
spread
boards
to
death
-
beds
,
and
from
mourning
-
weeds
to
holiday
garments
,
are
not
a
whit
less
startling
;
only
,
there
,
we
are
busy
actors
,
instead
of
passive
lookers
-
on
,
which
makes
a
vast
difference
.
 
<EOS>
The
actors
in
the
mimic
life
of
the
theatre
,
are
blind
to
violent
transitions
and
abrupt
impulses
of
passion
or
feeling
,
which
,
presented
before
the
eyes
of
mere
spectators
,
are
at
once
condemned
as
outrageous
and
preposterous
.
   
<EOS>
As
sudden
shiftings
of
the
scene
,
and
rapid
changes
of
time
and
place
,
are
not
only
sanctioned
in
books
by
long
usage
,
but
are
by
many
considered
as
the
great
art
of
authorship
:
an
author
's
skill
in
his
craft
being
,
by
such
critics
,
chiefly
estimated
with
relation
to
the
dilemmas
in
which
he
leaves
his
characters
at
the
end
of
every
chapter
:
this
brief
introduction
to
the
present
one
may
perhaps
be
deemed
unnecessary
.
 
<EOS>
If
so
,
let
it
be
considered
a
delicate
intimation
on
the
part
of
the
historian
that
he
is
going
back
to
the
town
in
which
Oliver
Twist
was
born
;
the
reader
taking
it
for
granted
that
there
are
good
and
substantial
reasons
for
making
the
journey
,
or
he
would
not
be
invited
to
proceed
upon
such
an
expedition
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
emerged
at
early
morning
from
the
workhouse
-
gate
,
and
walked
with
portly
carriage
and
commanding
steps
,
up
the
High
Street
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
full
bloom
and
pride
of
beadlehood
;
his
cocked
hat
and
coat
were
dazzling
in
the
morning
sun
;
he
clutched
his
cane
with
the
vigorous
tenacity
of
health
and
power
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
always
carried
his
head
high
;
but
this
morning
it
was
higher
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
abstraction
in
his
eye
,
an
elevation
in
his
air
,
which
might
have
warned
an
observant
stranger
that
thoughts
were
passing
in
the
beadle
's
mind
,
too
great
for
utterance
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
stopped
not
to
converse
with
the
small
shopkeepers
and
others
who
spoke
to
him
,
deferentially
,
as
he
passed
along
.
 
<EOS>
He
merely
returned
their
salutations
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
,
and
relaxed
not
in
his
dignified
pace
,
until
he
reached
the
farm
where
Mrs
Mann
tended
the
infant
paupers
with
parochial
care
.
   
<EOS>
"
Drat
that
beadle
!
"
said
Mrs
Mann
,
hearing
the
well
-
known
shaking
at
the
garden
-
gate
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
it
is
n't
him
at
this
time
in
the
morning
!
 
<EOS>
Lauk
,
Mr
Bumble
,
only
think
of
its
being
you
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
dear
me
,
it
IS
a
pleasure
,
this
is
!
 
<EOS>
Come
into
the
parlour
,
sir
,
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
first
sentence
was
addressed
to
Susan
;
and
the
exclamations
of
delight
were
uttered
to
Mr
Bumble
:
as
the
good
lady
unlocked
the
garden
-
gate
:
and
showed
him
,
with
great
attention
and
respect
,
into
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Mann
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
;
not
sitting
upon
,
or
dropping
himself
into
a
seat
,
as
any
common
jackanapes
would
:
but
letting
himself
gradually
and
slowly
down
into
a
chair
;
"
Mrs
Mann
,
ma'am
,
good
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
and
good
morning
to
YOU
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mrs
Mann
,
with
many
smiles
;
"
and
hoping
you
find
yourself
well
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
<EOS>
-
so
,
Mrs
Mann
,
"
replied
the
beadle
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
porochial
life
is
not
a
bed
of
roses
,
Mrs
Mann
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
that
it
is
n't
indeed
,
Mr
Bumble
,
"
rejoined
the
lady
.
<EOS>
And
all
the
infant
paupers
might
have
chorussed
the
rejoinder
with
great
propriety
,
if
they
had
heard
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
porochial
life
,
ma'am
<EOS>
,
"
continued
Mr
Bumble
,
striking
the
table
with
his
cane
,
"
is
a
life
of
worrit
,
and
vexation
,
and
hardihood
;
but
all
public
characters
,
as
I
may
say
,
must
suffer
prosecution
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Mann
,
not
very
well
knowing
what
the
beadle
meant
,
raised
her
hands
with
a
look
of
sympathy
,
and
sighed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
You
may
well
sigh
,
Mrs
Mann
!
"
said
the
beadle
.
   
<EOS>
Finding
she
had
done
right
,
Mrs
Mann
sighed
again
:
 
evidently
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
public
character
:
 
who
,
repressing
a
complacent
smile
by
looking
sternly
at
his
cocked
hat
,
said
,
   
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Mann
,
I
am
going
to
London
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lauk
,
Mr
Bumble
!
"
cried
Mrs
Mann
,
starting
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
London
,
ma'am
,
"
resumed
the
inflexible
beadle
,
"
by
coach
.
 
<EOS>
I
and
two
paupers
,
Mrs
Mann
!
 
<EOS>
A
legal
action
is
a
coming
on
,
about
a
settlement
;
and
the
board
has
appointed
me
---
me
,
Mrs
Mann
---
to
dispose
to
the
matter
before
the
quarter
-
sessions
at
Clerkinwell
.
   
<EOS>
And
I
very
much
question
,
"
added
Mr
Bumble
,
drawing
himself
up
,
"
whether
the
Clerkinwell
Sessions
will
not
find
themselves
in
the
wrong
box
before
they
have
done
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
must
n't
be
too
hard
upon
them
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Mann
,
coaxingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
Clerkinwell
Sessions
have
brought
it
upon
themselves
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
Mr
Bumble
;
"
and
if
the
Clerkinwell
Sessions
find
that
they
come
off
rather
worse
than
they
expected
,
the
Clerkinwell
Sessions
have
only
themselves
to
thank
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
so
much
determination
and
depth
of
purpose
about
the
menacing
manner
in
which
Mr
Bumble
delivered
himself
of
these
words
,
that
Mrs
Mann
appeared
quite
awed
by
them
.
<EOS>
At
length
she
said
,
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
going
by
coach
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
always
usual
to
send
them
paupers
in
carts
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
when
they
're
ill
,
Mrs
Mann
,
"
said
the
beadle
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
put
the
sick
paupers
into
open
carts
in
the
rainy
weather
,
to
prevent
their
taking
cold
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Mrs
Mann
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
opposition
coach
contracts
for
these
two
;
and
takes
them
cheap
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
both
in
a
very
low
state
,
and
we
find
it
would
come
two
pound
cheaper
to
move
'em
than
to
bury
'em
---
<EOS>
that
is
,
if
we
can
throw
'em
upon
another
parish
,
which
I
think
we
shall
be
able
to
do
,
if
they
do
n't
die
upon
the
road
to
spite
us
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
When
Mr
Bumble
had
laughed
a
little
while
,
his
eyes
again
encountered
the
cocked
hat
;
and
he
became
grave
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
forgetting
business
,
ma'am
,
"
said
the
beadle
;
"
here
is
your
porochial
stipend
for
the
month
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
produced
some
silver
money
rolled
up
in
paper
,
from
his
pocket
-
book
;
and
requested
a
receipt
:
 
which
Mrs
Mann
wrote
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
much
blotted
,
sir
,
"
said
the
farmer
of
infants
;
"
but
<EOS>
it
's
formal
enough
,
I
dare
say
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
Mr
Bumble
,
sir
,
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
nodded
,
blandly
,
in
acknowledgment
of
Mrs
Mann
's
curtsey
;
and
inquired
how
the
children
were
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
their
dear
little
hearts
!
"
said
Mrs
Mann
with
emotion
,
"
they
're
as
well
as
can
be
,
the
dears
!
 
<EOS>
Of
course
,
except
the
two
that
died
last
week
.
 
<EOS>
And
little
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
that
boy
no
better
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Mann
shook
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
ill
-
conditioned
,
wicious
,
bad
-
disposed
porochial
child
that
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
bring
him
to
you
in
one
minute
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mrs
Mann
.
<EOS>
"
Here
,
you
Dick
!
"
   
<EOS>
After
some
calling
,
Dick
was
discovered
.
 
<EOS>
Having
had
his
face
put
under
the
pump
,
and
dried
upon
Mrs
Mann
's
gown
,
he
was
led
into
the
awful
presence
of
Mr
Bumble
,
the
beadle
.
   
<EOS>
The
child
was
pale
and
thin
;
his
cheeks
were
sunken
;
and
his
eyes
large
and
bright
.
 
<EOS>
The
scanty
parish
dress
,
the
livery
of
his
misery
,
hung
loosely
on
his
feeble
body
;
and
his
young
limbs
had
wasted
away
,
like
those
of
an
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
Such
was
the
little
being
who
stood
trembling
beneath
Mr
Bumble
's
glance
;
not
daring
to
lift
his
eyes
from
the
floor
;
and
dreading
even
to
hear
the
beadle
's
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
you
look
at
the
gentleman
,
you
obstinate
boy
?
"
said
Mrs
Mann
.
   
<EOS>
The
child
meekly
raised
his
eyes
,
and
encountered
those
of
Mr
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
with
you
,
porochial
Dick
?
"
inquired
Mr
Bumble
,
with
well
-
timed
jocularity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
child
faintly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
not
,
"
said
Mrs
Mann
,
who
had
of
course
laughed
very
much
at
Mr
Bumble
's
humour
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
want
for
nothing
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
---
<EOS>
"
faltered
the
child
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hey
-
day
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Mr
Mann
,
"
I
suppose
you
're
going
to
say
that
you
DO
want
for
something
,
now
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
you
little
wretch
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
Stop
,
Mrs
Mann
,
stop
!
"
said
the
beadle
,
raising
his
hand
with
a
show
of
authority
.
 
<EOS>
"
Like
what
,
sir
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
,
"
said
the
child
,
"
to
leave
my
dear
love
to
poor
Oliver
Twist
;
and
to
let
him
know
how
often
I
have
sat
by
myself
and
cried
to
think
of
his
wandering
about
in
the
dark
nights
with
nobody
to
help
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
should
like
to
tell
him
,
"
said
the
child
pressing
his
small
hands
together
,
and
speaking
with
great
fervour
,
"
that
I
was
glad
to
die
when
I
was
very
young
;
for
,
perhaps
,
if
I
had
lived
to
be
a
man
,
and
had
grown
old
,
my
little
sister
who
is
in
Heaven
,
might
forget
me
,
or
be
unlike
me
;
and
it
would
be
so
much
happier
if
we
were
both
children
there
together
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
surveyed
the
little
speaker
,
from
head
to
foot
,
with
indescribable
astonishment
;
and
,
turning
to
his
companion
,
said
,
"
They
're
all
in
one
story
,
Mrs
Mann
.
 
<EOS>
That
out
-
dacious
Oliver
had
demogalized
them
all
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
have
believed
it
,
sir
"
said
Mrs
Mann
,
holding
up
her
hands
,
and
looking
malignantly
at
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
such
a
hardened
little
wretch
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Take
him
away
,
ma'am
!
"
said
Mr
Bumble
imperiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
must
be
stated
to
the
board
,
Mrs
Mann
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
the
gentleman
will
understand
that
it
is
n't
my
fault
,
sir
?
"
said
Mrs
Mann
,
whimpering
pathetically
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
shall
understand
that
,
ma'am
;
they
shall
be
acquainted
with
the
true
state
of
the
case
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
;
take
him
away
,
I
ca
n't
bear
the
sight
on
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Dick
was
immediately
taken
away
,
and
locked
up
in
the
coal
-
cellar
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
shortly
afterwards
took
himself
off
,
to
prepare
for
his
journey
.
   
<EOS>
At
six
o'clock
next
morning
,
Mr
Bumble
:
 
having
exchanged
his
cocked
hat
for
a
round
one
,
and
encased
his
person
in
a
blue
great
-
coat
with
a
cape
to
it
:
 
took
his
place
on
the
outside
of
the
coach
,
accompanied
by
the
criminals
whose
settlement
was
disputed
;
with
whom
,
in
due
course
of
time
,
he
arrived
in
London
.
   
<EOS>
He
experienced
no
other
crosses
on
the
way
,
than
those
which
originated
in
the
perverse
behaviour
of
the
two
paupers
,
who
persisted
in
shivering
,
and
complaining
of
the
cold
,
in
a
manner
which
,
Mr
Bumble
declared
,
caused
his
teeth
to
chatter
in
his
head
,
and
made
him
feel
quite
uncomfortable
;
although
he
had
a
great
-
coat
on
.
   
<EOS>
Having
disposed
of
these
evil
-
minded
persons
for
the
night
,
Mr
Bumble
sat
himself
down
in
the
house
at
which
the
coach
stopped
;
and
took
a
temperate
dinner
of
steaks
,
oyster
sauce
,
and
porter
.
<EOS>
Putting
a
glass
of
hot
gin
-
and
-
water
on
the
chimney
-
piece
,
he
drew
his
chair
to
the
fire
;
and
,
with
sundry
moral
reflections
on
the
too
-
prevalent
sin
of
discontent
and
complaining
,
composed
himself
to
read
the
paper
.
   
<EOS>
The
very
first
paragraph
upon
which
Mr
Bumble
's
eye
rested
,
was
the
following
advertisement
.
                    
<EOS>
"
FIVE
GUINEAS
REWARD
   
<EOS>
"
Whereas
a
young
boy
,
named
Oliver
Twist
,
absconded
,
or
was
enticed
,
on
Thursday
evening
last
,
from
his
home
,
at
Pentonville
;
and
has
not
since
been
heard
of
.
 
<EOS>
The
above
reward
will
be
paid
to
any
person
who
will
give
such
information
as
will
lead
to
the
discovery
of
the
said
Oliver
Twist
,
or
tend
to
throw
any
light
upon
his
previous
history
,
in
which
the
advertiser
is
,
for
many
reasons
,
warmly
interested
.
"
   
<EOS>
And
then
followed
a
full
description
of
Oliver
's
dress
,
person
,
appearance
,
and
disappearance
:
 
with
the
name
and
address
of
Mr
Brownlow
at
full
length
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
opened
his
eyes
;
read
the
advertisement
,
slowly
and
carefully
,
three
several
times
;
and
in
something
more
than
five
minutes
was
on
his
way
to
Pentonville
:
having
actually
,
in
his
excitement
,
left
the
glass
of
hot
gin
-
and
-
water
,
untasted
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr
Brownlow
at
home
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Bumble
of
the
girl
who
opened
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
To
this
inquiry
the
girl
returned
the
not
uncommon
,
but
rather
evasive
reply
of
"
I
do
n't
know
;
where
do
you
come
from
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
no
sooner
uttered
Oliver
's
name
,
in
explanation
of
his
errand
,
than
Mrs
Bedwin
,
who
had
been
listening
at
the
parlour
door
,
hastened
into
the
passage
in
a
breathless
state
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
come
in
,
"
said
the
old
lady
:
"
<EOS>
I
knew
we
should
hear
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
dear
!
 
<EOS>
I
knew
we
should
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
certain
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
his
heart
!
 
<EOS>
I
said
so
all
along
.
"
   
<EOS>
Having
heard
this
,
the
worthy
old
lady
hurried
back
into
the
parlour
again
;
and
seating
herself
on
a
sofa
,
burst
into
tears
.
<EOS>
The
girl
,
who
was
not
quite
so
susceptible
,
had
run
upstairs
meanwhile
;
and
now
returned
with
a
request
that
Mr
Bumble
would
follow
her
immediately
:
 
which
he
did
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
shown
into
the
little
back
study
,
where
sat
Mr
Brownlow
and
his
friend
Mr
Grimwig
,
with
decanters
and
glasses
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
gentleman
at
once
burst
into
the
exclamation
:
   
"
A
beadle
.
 
<EOS>
A
parish
beadle
,
or
<EOS>
I
'll
eat
my
head
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
interrupt
just
now
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
a
seat
,
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
sat
himself
down
;
quite
confounded
by
the
oddity
of
Mr
Grimwig
's
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Brownlow
moved
the
lamp
,
so
as
to
obtain
an
uninterrupted
view
of
the
beadle
's
countenance
;
and
said
,
with
a
little
impatience
,
   
"
Now
,
sir
,
you
come
in
consequence
of
having
seen
the
advertisement
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
ARE
a
beadle
,
are
you
not
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Grimwig
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
porochial
beadle
,
gentlemen
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Bumble
proudly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
observed
Mr
Grimwig
aside
to
his
friend
,
"
<EOS>
I
knew
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
A
beadle
all
over
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Brownlow
gently
shook
his
head
to
impose
silence
on
his
friend
,
and
resumed
:
   
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
where
this
poor
boy
is
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
more
than
nobody
,
"
replied
Mr
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
what
DO
you
know
of
him
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
old
gentleman
.
"
<EOS>
Speak
out
,
my
friend
,
if
you
have
anything
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
What
DO
you
know
of
him
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
happen
to
know
any
good
of
him
,
do
you
?
"
said
Mr
Grimwig
,
caustically
;
after
an
attentive
perusal
of
Mr
Bumble
's
features
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
,
catching
at
the
inquiry
very
quickly
,
shook
his
head
with
portentous
solemnity
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
?
"
said
Mr
Grimwig
,
looking
triumphantly
at
Mr
Brownlow
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Brownlow
looked
apprehensively
at
Mr
Bumble
's
pursed
-
up
countenance
;
and
requested
him
to
communicate
what
he
knew
regarding
Oliver
,
in
as
few
words
as
possible
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
put
down
his
hat
;
unbuttoned
his
coat
;
folded
his
arms
;
inclined
his
head
in
a
retrospective
manner
;
and
,
after
a
few
moments
'
reflection
,
commenced
his
story
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
be
tedious
if
given
in
the
beadle
's
words
:
 
occupying
,
as
it
did
,
some
twenty
minutes
in
the
telling
;
but
the
sum
and
substance
of
it
was
,
that
Oliver
was
a
foundling
,
born
of
low
and
vicious
parents
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
had
,
from
his
birth
,
displayed
no
better
qualities
than
treachery
,
ingratitude
,
and
malice
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
had
terminated
his
brief
career
in
the
place
of
his
birth
,
by
making
a
sanguinary
and
cowardly
attack
on
an
unoffending
lad
,
and
running
away
in
the
night
-
time
from
his
master
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
In
proof
of
his
really
being
the
person
he
represented
himself
,
Mr
Bumble
laid
upon
the
table
the
papers
he
had
brought
to
town
.
<EOS>
Folding
his
arms
again
,
he
then
awaited
Mr
Brownlow
's
observations
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
it
is
all
too
true
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
sorrowfully
,
after
looking
over
the
papers
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
not
much
for
your
intelligence
;
but
I
would
gladly
have
given
you
treble
the
money
,
if
it
had
been
favourable
to
the
boy
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
is
not
improbable
that
if
Mr
Bumble
had
been
possessed
of
this
information
at
an
earlier
period
of
the
interview
,
he
might
have
imparted
a
very
different
colouring
to
his
little
history
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
late
to
do
it
now
,
however
;
so
he
shook
his
head
gravely
,
and
,
pocketing
the
five
guineas
,
withdrew
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Brownlow
paced
the
room
to
and
fro
for
some
minutes
;
evidently
so
much
disturbed
by
the
beadle
's
tale
,
that
even
Mr
Grimwig
forbore
to
vex
him
further
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
he
stopped
,
and
rang
the
bell
violently
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Bedwin
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
when
the
housekeeper
appeared
;
"
<EOS>
that
boy
,
Oliver
,
is
an
imposter
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
ca
n't
be
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
,
"
said
the
old
lady
energetically
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
he
is
,
"
retorted
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
ca
n't
be
?
 
<EOS>
We
have
just
heard
a
full
account
of
him
from
his
birth
;
and
he
has
been
a
thorough
-
paced
little
villain
,
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
will
believe
it
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
old
lady
,
firmly
.
"
<EOS>
Never
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
old
women
never
believe
anything
but
quack
-
doctors
,
and
lying
story
-
books
,
"
growled
Mr
Grimwig
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
it
all
along
.
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
you
take
my
advise
in
the
beginning
;
you
would
if
he
had
n't
had
a
fever
,
I
suppose
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
He
was
interesting
,
was
n't
he
?
 
<EOS>
Interesting
!
 
<EOS>
Bah
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
Mr
Grimwig
poked
the
fire
with
a
flourish
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
a
dear
,
grateful
,
gentle
child
,
sir
,
"
retorted
Mrs
Bedwin
,
indignantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
children
are
,
sir
;
and
have
done
these
forty
years
;
and
people
who
ca
n't
say
the
same
,
should
n't
say
anything
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
my
opinion
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
a
hard
hit
at
Mr
Grimwig
,
who
was
a
bachelor
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
extorted
nothing
from
that
gentleman
but
a
smile
,
the
old
lady
tossed
her
head
,
and
smoothed
down
her
apron
preparatory
to
another
speech
,
when
she
was
stopped
by
Mr
Brownlow
.
   
<EOS>
"
Silence
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
feigning
an
anger
he
was
far
from
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
let
me
hear
the
boy
's
name
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
rang
to
tell
you
that
.
 
<EOS>
Never
.
 
<EOS>
Never
,
on
any
pretence
,
mind
!
 
<EOS>
You
may
leave
the
room
,
Mrs
Bedwin
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
in
earnest
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
were
sad
hearts
at
Mr
Brownlow
's
that
night
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
's
heart
sank
within
him
,
when
he
thought
of
his
good
friends
;
it
was
well
for
him
that
he
could
not
know
what
they
had
heard
,
or
it
might
have
broken
outright
.
    
Chapter
08
.
<EOS>
How
Oliver
passed
his
time
in
the
improving
society
of
his
reputable
friends
.
 
<EOS>
About
noon
next
day
,
when
the
Dodger
and
Master
Bates
had
gone
out
to
pursue
their
customary
avocations
,
Mr
Fagin
took
the
opportunity
of
reading
Oliver
a
long
lecture
on
the
crying
sin
of
ingratitude
;
of
which
he
clearly
demonstrated
he
had
been
guilty
,
to
no
ordinary
extent
,
in
wilfully
absenting
himself
from
the
society
of
his
anxious
friends
;
and
,
still
more
,
in
endeavouring
to
escape
from
them
after
so
much
trouble
and
expense
had
been
incurred
in
his
recovery
.
<EOS>
Mr
Fagin
laid
great
stress
on
the
fact
of
his
having
taken
Oliver
in
,
and
cherished
him
,
when
,
without
his
timely
aid
,
he
might
have
perished
with
hunger
;
and
he
related
the
dismal
and
affecting
history
of
a
young
lad
whom
,
in
his
philanthropy
,
he
had
succoured
under
parallel
circumstances
,
but
who
,
proving
unworthy
of
his
confidence
and
evincing
a
desire
to
communicate
with
the
police
,
had
unfortunately
come
to
be
hanged
at
the
Old
Bailey
one
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Fagin
did
not
seek
to
conceal
his
share
in
the
catastrophe
,
but
lamented
with
tears
in
his
eyes
that
the
wrong
-
headed
and
treacherous
behaviour
of
the
young
person
in
question
,
had
rendered
it
necessary
that
he
should
become
the
victim
of
certain
evidence
for
the
crown
:
which
,
if
it
were
not
precisely
true
,
was
indispensably
necessary
for
the
safety
of
him
(
Mr
Fagin
)
and
a
few
select
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Fagin
concluded
by
drawing
a
rather
disagreeable
picture
of
the
discomforts
of
hanging
;
and
,
with
great
friendliness
and
politeness
of
manner
,
expressed
his
anxious
hopes
that
he
might
never
be
obliged
to
submit
Oliver
Twist
to
that
unpleasant
operation
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Oliver
's
blood
ran
cold
,
as
he
listened
to
the
Jew
's
words
,
and
imperfectly
comprehended
the
dark
threats
conveyed
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
That
it
was
possible
even
for
justice
itself
to
confound
the
innocent
with
the
guilty
when
they
were
in
accidental
companionship
,
he
knew
already
;
and
that
deeply
-
laid
plans
for
the
destruction
of
inconveniently
knowing
or
over
-
communicative
persons
,
had
been
really
devised
and
carried
out
by
the
Jew
on
more
occasions
than
one
,
he
thought
by
no
means
unlikely
,
when
he
recollected
the
general
nature
of
the
altercations
between
that
gentleman
and
Mr
Sikes
:
which
seemed
to
bear
reference
to
some
foregone
conspiracy
of
the
kind
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
glanced
timidly
up
,
and
met
the
Jew
's
searching
look
,
he
felt
that
his
pale
face
and
trembling
limbs
were
neither
unnoticed
nor
unrelished
by
that
wary
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
,
smiling
hideously
,
patted
Oliver
on
the
head
,
and
said
,
that
if
he
kept
himself
quiet
,
and
applied
himself
to
business
,
he
saw
they
would
be
very
good
friends
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
taking
his
hat
,
and
covering
himself
with
an
old
patched
great
-
coat
,
he
went
out
,
and
locked
the
room
-
door
behind
him
.
   
<EOS>
And
so
Oliver
remained
all
that
day
,
and
for
the
greater
part
of
many
subsequent
days
,
seeing
nobody
,
between
early
morning
and
midnight
,
and
left
during
the
long
hours
to
commune
with
his
own
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
Which
,
never
failing
to
revert
to
his
kind
friends
,
and
the
opinion
they
must
long
ago
have
formed
of
him
,
were
sad
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
After
the
lapse
of
a
week
or
so
,
the
Jew
left
the
room
-
door
unlocked
;
and
he
was
at
liberty
to
wander
about
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
dirty
place
.
 
<EOS>
The
rooms
upstairs
had
great
high
wooden
chimney
-
pieces
and
large
doors
,
with
panelled
walls
and
cornices
to
the
ceiling
;
which
,
although
they
were
black
with
neglect
and
dust
,
were
ornamented
in
various
ways
.
 
<EOS>
From
all
of
these
tokens
Oliver
concluded
that
a
long
time
ago
,
before
the
old
Jew
was
born
,
it
had
belonged
to
better
people
,
and
had
perhaps
been
quite
gay
and
handsome
:
 
dismal
and
dreary
as
it
looked
now
.
   
<EOS>
Spiders
had
built
their
webs
in
the
angles
of
the
walls
and
ceilings
;
and
sometimes
,
when
Oliver
walked
softly
into
a
room
,
the
mice
would
scamper
across
the
floor
,
and
run
back
terrified
to
their
holes
.
 
<EOS>
With
these
exceptions
,
there
was
neither
sight
nor
sound
of
any
living
thing
;
and
often
,
when
it
grew
dark
,
and
he
was
tired
of
wandering
from
room
to
room
,
he
would
crouch
in
the
corner
of
the
passage
by
the
street
-
door
,
to
be
as
near
living
people
as
he
could
;
and
would
remain
there
,
listening
and
counting
the
hours
,
until
the
Jew
or
the
boys
returned
.
   
<EOS>
In
all
the
rooms
,
the
mouldering
shutters
were
fast
closed
:
 
<EOS>
the
bars
which
held
them
were
screwed
tight
into
the
wood
;
the
only
light
which
was
admitted
,
stealing
its
way
through
round
holes
at
the
top
:
which
made
the
rooms
more
gloomy
,
and
filled
them
with
strange
shadows
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
back
-
garret
window
with
rusty
bars
outside
,
which
had
no
shutter
;
and
out
of
this
,
Oliver
often
gazed
with
a
melancholy
face
for
hours
together
;
but
nothing
was
to
be
descried
from
it
but
a
confused
and
crowded
mass
of
housetops
,
blackened
chimneys
,
and
gable
-
ends
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
indeed
,
a
grizzly
head
might
be
seen
,
peering
over
the
parapet
-
wall
of
a
distant
house
;
but
it
was
quickly
withdrawn
again
;
and
as
the
window
of
Oliver
's
observatory
was
nailed
down
,
and
dimmed
with
the
rain
and
smoke
of
years
,
it
was
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
make
out
the
forms
of
the
different
objects
beyond
,
without
making
any
attempt
to
be
seen
or
heard
,
---
which
he
had
as
much
chance
of
being
,
as
if
he
had
lived
inside
the
ball
of
St
Paul
's
Cathedral
.
   
<EOS>
One
afternoon
,
the
Dodger
and
Master
Bates
being
engaged
out
that
evening
,
the
first
-
named
young
gentleman
took
it
into
his
head
to
evince
some
anxiety
regarding
the
decoration
of
his
person
(
to
do
him
justice
,
this
was
by
no
means
an
habitual
weakness
with
him
)
;
and
,
with
this
end
and
aim
,
he
condescendingly
commanded
Oliver
to
assist
him
in
his
toilet
,
straightway
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
was
but
too
glad
to
make
himself
useful
;
too
happy
to
have
some
faces
,
however
bad
,
to
look
upon
;
too
desirous
to
conciliate
those
about
him
when
he
could
honestly
do
so
;
to
throw
any
objection
in
the
way
of
this
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
at
once
expressed
his
readiness
;
and
,
kneeling
on
the
floor
,
while
the
Dodger
sat
upon
the
table
so
that
he
could
take
his
foot
in
his
laps
,
he
applied
himself
to
a
process
which
Mr
Dawkins
designated
as
"
japanning
his
trotter
-
cases
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
phrase
,
rendered
into
plain
English
,
signifieth
,
cleaning
his
boots
.
   
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
the
sense
of
freedom
and
independence
which
a
rational
animal
may
be
supposed
to
feel
when
he
sits
on
a
table
in
an
easy
attitude
smoking
a
pipe
,
swinging
one
leg
carelessly
to
and
fro
,
and
having
his
boots
cleaned
all
the
time
,
without
even
the
past
trouble
of
having
taken
them
off
,
or
the
prospective
misery
of
putting
them
on
,
to
disturb
his
reflections
;
or
whether
it
was
the
goodness
of
the
tobacco
that
soothed
the
feelings
of
the
Dodger
,
or
the
mildness
of
the
beer
that
mollified
his
thoughts
;
he
was
evidently
tinctured
,
for
the
nonce
,
with
a
spice
of
romance
and
enthusiasm
,
foreign
to
his
general
nature
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
down
on
Oliver
,
with
a
thoughtful
countenance
,
for
a
brief
space
;
and
then
,
raising
his
head
,
and
heaving
a
gentle
sign
,
said
,
half
in
abstraction
,
and
half
to
Master
Bates
:
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
pity
it
is
he
is
n't
a
prig
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Master
Charles
Bates
;
"
he
do
n't
know
what
's
good
for
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Dodger
sighed
again
,
and
resumed
his
pipe
:
as
did
Charley
Bates
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
smoked
,
for
some
seconds
,
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
do
n't
even
know
what
a
prig
is
?
"
said
the
Dodger
mournfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
know
that
,
"
replied
Oliver
,
looking
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
the
---
;
you
're
one
,
are
you
not
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Oliver
,
checking
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
"
replied
the
Doger
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
scorn
to
be
anything
else
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dawkins
gave
his
hat
a
ferocious
cock
,
after
delivering
this
sentiment
,
and
looked
at
Master
Bates
,
as
if
to
denote
that
he
would
feel
obliged
by
his
saying
anything
to
the
contrary
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
"
repeated
the
Dodger
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
's
Charley
.
 
<EOS>
So
's
Fagin
.
<EOS>
So
's
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
So
's
Nancy
.
 
<EOS>
So
's
Bet
.
 
<EOS>
So
we
all
are
,
down
to
the
dog
.
<EOS>
And
he
's
the
downiest
one
of
the
lot
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
least
given
to
peaching
,
"
added
Charley
Bates
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
would
n't
so
much
as
bark
in
a
witness
-
box
,
for
fear
of
committing
himself
;
no
,
not
if
you
tied
him
up
in
one
,
and
left
him
there
without
wittles
for
a
fortnight
,
"
said
the
Dodger
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
"
observed
Charley
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
rum
dog
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
he
look
fierce
at
any
strange
cove
that
laughs
or
sings
when
he
's
in
company
!
"
pursued
the
Dodger
.
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
he
growl
at
all
,
when
he
hears
a
fiddle
playing
!
 
<EOS>
And
do
n't
he
hate
other
dogs
as
ai
n't
of
his
breed
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
an
out
-
and
-
out
Christian
,
"
said
Charley
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
merely
intended
as
a
tribute
to
the
animal
's
abilities
,
but
it
was
an
appropriate
remark
in
another
sense
,
if
Master
Bates
had
only
known
it
;
for
there
are
a
good
many
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
claiming
to
be
out
-
and
-
out
Christians
,
between
whom
,
and
Mr
Sikes
'
dog
<EOS>
,
there
exist
strong
and
singular
points
of
resemblance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
said
the
Dodger
,
recurring
to
the
point
from
which
they
had
strayed
:
with
that
mindfulness
of
his
profession
which
influenced
all
his
proceedings
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
has
n't
go
anything
to
do
with
young
Green
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
more
it
has
,
"
said
Charley
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
put
yourself
under
Fagin
,
Oliver
?
"
   
"
And
make
your
fortun
"
out
of
hand
?
"
<EOS>
added
the
Dodger
,
with
a
grin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
be
able
to
retire
on
your
property
,
and
do
the
gen
-
teel
:
as
I
mean
to
,
in
the
very
next
leap
-
year
but
four
that
ever
comes
,
and
the
forty
-
second
Tuesday
in
Trinity
-
week
,
"
said
Charley
Bates
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
it
,
"
rejoined
Oliver
,
timidly
;
"
I
wish
they
would
let
me
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
---
I
---
would
rather
go
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
Fagin
would
RATHER
not
!
"
rejoined
Charley
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
knew
this
too
well
;
but
thinking
it
might
be
dangerous
to
express
his
feelings
more
openly
,
he
only
sighed
,
and
went
on
with
his
boot
-
cleaning
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
Dodger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
where
's
your
spirit
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
take
any
pride
out
of
yourself
?
 
<EOS>
Would
you
go
and
be
dependent
on
your
friends
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
blow
that
!
"
said
Master
Bates
:
drawing
two
or
three
silk
handkerchiefs
from
his
pocket
,
and
tossing
them
into
a
cupboard
,
"
that
's
too
mean
;
that
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
\
<EOS>
I
\
could
n't
do
it
,
"
said
the
Dodger
,
with
an
air
of
haughty
disgust
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
leave
your
friends
,
though
,
"
said
Oliver
with
a
half
smile
;
"
and
let
them
be
punished
for
what
you
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
,
"
rejoined
the
Dodger
,
with
a
wave
of
his
pipe
,
"
That
was
all
out
of
consideration
for
Fagin
,
'cause
the
traps
know
that
we
work
together
,
and
he
might
have
got
into
trouble
if
we
had
n't
made
our
lucky
;
that
was
the
move
,
was
n't
it
,
Charley
?
"
   
<EOS>
Master
Bates
nodded
assent
,
and
would
have
spoken
,
but
the
recollection
of
Oliver
's
flight
came
so
suddenly
upon
him
,
that
the
smoke
he
was
inhaling
got
entagled
with
a
laugh
,
and
went
up
into
his
head
,
and
down
into
his
throat
:
and
brought
on
a
fit
of
coughing
and
stamping
,
about
five
minutes
long
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
here
!
"
said
the
Dodger
,
drawing
forth
a
handful
of
shillings
and
halfpence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
's
a
jolly
life
!
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
odds
where
it
comes
from
?
 
<EOS>
Here
,
catch
hold
;
there
's
plenty
more
where
they
were
took
from
.
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
,
wo
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
precious
flat
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
naughty
,
ai
n't
it
,
Oliver
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Charley
Bates
.
<EOS>
"
He
'll
come
to
be
scragged
,
wo
n't
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
that
means
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Something
in
this
way
,
old
feller
,
"
said
Charly
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
said
it
,
Master
Bates
caught
up
an
end
of
his
neckerchief
;
and
,
holding
it
erect
in
the
air
,
dropped
his
head
on
his
shoulder
,
and
jerked
a
curious
sound
through
his
teeth
;
thereby
indicating
,
by
a
lively
pantomimic
representation
,
that
scragging
and
hanging
were
one
and
the
same
thing
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
it
means
,
"
said
Charley
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
how
he
stares
,
Jack
!
   
<EOS>
I
never
did
see
such
prime
company
as
that
'
ere
boy
;
he
'll
be
the
death
of
me
<EOS>
,
I
know
he
will
.
"
 
<EOS>
Master
Charley
Bates
,
having
laughed
heartily
again
,
resumed
his
pipe
with
tears
in
his
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
've
been
brought
up
bad
,
"
said
the
Dodger
,
surveying
his
boots
with
much
satisfaction
when
Oliver
had
polished
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fagin
will
make
something
of
you
,
though
,
or
you
'll
be
the
first
he
ever
had
that
turned
out
unprofitable
.
 
<EOS>
You
'd
better
begin
at
once
;
for
you
'll
come
to
the
trade
long
before
you
think
of
it
;
and
you
're
only
losing
time
,
Oliver
.
"
   
<EOS>
Master
Bates
backed
this
advice
with
sundry
moral
admonitions
of
his
own
:
 
which
,
being
exhausted
,
he
and
his
friend
Mr
Dawkins
launched
into
a
glowing
description
of
the
numerous
pleasures
incidental
to
the
life
they
led
,
interspersed
with
a
variety
of
hints
to
Oliver
that
the
best
thing
he
could
do
,
would
be
to
secure
Fagin
's
favour
without
more
delay
,
by
the
means
which
they
themselves
had
employed
to
gain
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
always
put
this
in
your
pipe
,
Nolly
,
"
said
the
Dodger
,
as
the
Jew
was
heard
unlocking
the
door
above
,
"
if
you
do
n't
take
fogels
and
tickers
---
"
   
"
What
's
the
good
of
talking
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
"
interposed
Master
Bates
;
"
he
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
take
pocket
-
handkechers
and
watches
,
"
said
the
Dodger
,
reducing
his
conversation
to
the
level
of
Oliver
's
capacity
,
"
some
other
cove
will
;
so
that
the
coves
that
lose
'em
will
be
all
the
worse
,
and
you
'll
be
all
the
worse
,
too
,
and
nobody
half
a
ha'p'orth
the
better
,
<EOS>
except
the
chaps
wot
gets
them
---
and
you
've
just
as
good
<EOS>
a
right
to
them
as
they
have
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
To
be
sure
,
to
be
sure
!
"
said
the
Jew
,
who
had
entered
unseen
by
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
all
lies
in
a
nutshell
<EOS>
my
dear
;
in
a
nutshell
,
take
the
Dodger
's
word
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
 
<EOS>
He
understands
the
catechism
of
his
trade
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
rubbed
his
hands
gleefully
together
,
as
he
corroborated
the
Dodger
's
reasoning
in
these
terms
;
and
chuckled
with
delight
at
his
pupil
's
proficiency
.
   
<EOS>
The
conversation
proceeded
no
farther
at
this
time
,
for
the
Jew
had
returned
home
accompanied
by
Miss
Betsy
,
and
a
gentleman
whom
Oliver
had
never
seen
before
,
but
who
was
accosted
by
the
Dodger
as
Tom
Chitling
;
and
who
,
having
lingered
on
the
stairs
to
exchange
a
few
gallantries
with
the
lady
,
now
made
his
appearance
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chitling
was
older
in
years
than
the
Dodger
:
having
perhaps
numbered
eighteen
winters
;
but
there
was
a
degree
of
deference
in
his
deportment
towards
that
young
gentleman
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
felt
himself
conscious
of
a
slight
inferiority
in
point
of
genius
and
professional
aquirements
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
small
twinkling
eyes
,
and
a
pock
-
marked
face
;
wore
a
fur
cap
,
a
dark
corduroy
jacket
,
greasy
fustian
trousers
,
and
an
apron
.
 
<EOS>
His
wardrobe
was
,
in
truth
,
rather
out
of
repair
;
but
he
excused
himself
to
the
company
by
stating
that
his
"
time
"
was
only
out
an
hour
before
;
and
that
,
in
consequence
of
having
worn
the
regimentals
for
six
weeks
past
,
he
had
not
been
able
to
bestow
any
attention
on
his
private
clothes
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chitling
added
,
with
strong
marks
of
irritation
,
that
the
new
way
of
fumigating
clothes
up
yonder
was
infernal
unconstitutional
,
for
it
burnt
holes
in
them
,
and
there
was
no
remedy
against
the
County
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
remark
he
considered
to
apply
to
the
regulation
mode
of
cutting
the
hair
:
which
he
held
to
be
decidedly
unlawful
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chitling
wound
up
his
observations
by
stating
that
he
had
not
touched
a
drop
of
anything
for
forty
-
two
moral
long
hard
-
working
days
;
and
that
he
"
wished
he
might
be
busted
if
he
warn't
as
dry
as
a
lime
-
basket
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
do
you
think
the
gentleman
has
come
from
,
Oliver
?
"
inquired
the
Jew
,
with
a
grin
,
as
the
other
boys
put
a
bottle
of
spirits
on
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
---
do
n't
know
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Tom
Chitling
,
casting
a
contemptuous
look
at
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
young
friend
of
mine
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
the
Jew
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
in
luck
,
then
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
with
a
meaning
look
at
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
where
I
came
from
,
young
'
un
;
you
'll
find
your
way
there
,
soon
enough
,
I
'll
bet
a
crown
!
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
sally
,
the
boys
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
more
jokes
on
the
same
subject
,
they
exchanged
a
few
short
whispers
with
Fagin
;
and
withdrew
.
   
<EOS>
After
some
words
apart
between
the
last
comer
and
Fagin
,
they
drew
their
chairs
towards
the
fire
;
and
the
Jew
,
telling
Oliver
to
come
and
sit
by
him
,
led
the
conversation
to
the
topics
most
calculated
to
interest
his
hearers
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
,
the
great
advantages
of
the
trade
,
the
proficiency
of
the
Dodger
,
the
amiability
of
Charley
Bates
,
and
the
liberality
of
the
Jew
himself
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
these
subjects
displayed
signs
of
being
thoroughly
exhausted
;
and
Mr
Chitling
did
the
same
:
 
for
the
house
of
correction
becomes
fatiguing
after
a
week
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Betsy
accordingly
withdrew
;
and
left
the
party
to
their
repose
.
   
<EOS>
From
this
day
,
Oliver
was
seldom
left
alone
;
but
was
placed
in
almost
constant
communication
with
the
two
boys
,
who
played
the
old
game
with
the
Jew
every
day
:
whether
for
their
own
improvement
or
Oliver
's
,
Mr
Fagin
best
knew
.
 
<EOS>
At
other
times
the
old
man
would
tell
them
stories
of
robberies
he
had
committed
in
his
younger
days
:
 
mixed
up
with
so
much
that
was
droll
and
curious
,
that
Oliver
could
not
help
laughing
heartily
,
and
showing
that
he
was
amused
in
spite
of
all
his
better
feelings
.
   
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
wily
old
Jew
had
the
boy
in
his
toils
.
 
<EOS>
Having
prepared
his
mind
,
by
solitude
and
gloom
,
to
prefer
any
society
to
the
companionship
of
his
own
sad
thoughts
in
such
a
dreary
place
,
he
was
now
slowly
instilling
into
his
soul
the
poison
which
he
hoped
would
blacken
it
,
and
change
its
hue
for
ever
.

Chapter
19
.
<EOS>
In
which
a
notable
plan
is
discussed
and
determined
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
chill
,
damp
,
<EOS>
windy
night
,
when
the
Jew
:
buttoning
his
great
-
coat
tight
round
his
shrivelled
body
,
and
pulling
the
collar
up
over
his
ears
so
as
completely
to
obscure
the
lower
part
of
his
face
:
 
emerged
from
his
den
.
 
<EOS>
He
paused
on
the
step
as
the
door
was
locked
and
chained
behind
him
;
and
having
listened
while
the
boys
made
all
secure
,
and
until
their
retreating
footsteps
were
no
longer
audible
,
slunk
down
the
street
as
quickly
as
he
could
.
   
<EOS>
The
house
to
which
Oliver
had
been
conveyed
,
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
Whitechapel
.
 
<EOS>
The
Jew
stopped
for
an
instant
at
the
corner
of
the
street
;
and
,
glancing
suspiciously
round
,
crossed
the
road
,
and
struck
off
in
the
direction
of
the
Spitalfields
.
   
<EOS>
The
mud
lay
thick
upon
the
stones
,
and
a
black
mist
hung
over
the
streets
;
the
rain
fell
sluggishly
down
,
and
everything
felt
cold
and
clammy
to
the
touch
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
just
the
night
when
it
befitted
such
a
being
as
the
Jew
to
be
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
glided
stealthily
along
,
creeping
beneath
the
shelter
of
the
walls
and
doorways
,
the
hideous
old
man
seemed
like
some
loathsome
reptile
,
engendered
in
the
slime
and
darkness
through
which
he
moved
:
crawling
forth
,
by
night
,
in
search
of
some
rich
offal
for
a
meal
.
   
<EOS>
He
kept
on
his
course
,
through
many
winding
and
narrow
ways
,
until
he
reached
Bethnal
Green
;
then
,
turning
suddenly
off
to
the
left
,
he
soon
became
involved
in
a
maze
of
the
mean
and
dirty
streets
which
abound
in
that
close
and
densely
-
populated
quarter
.
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
was
evidently
too
familiar
with
the
ground
he
traversed
to
be
at
all
bewildered
,
either
by
the
darkness
of
the
night
,
or
the
intricacies
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
hurried
through
several
alleys
and
streets
,
and
at
length
turned
into
one
,
lighted
only
by
a
single
lamp
at
the
farther
end
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
door
of
a
house
in
this
street
,
he
knocked
;
having
exchanged
a
few
muttered
words
with
the
person
who
opened
it
,
he
walked
upstairs
.
   
<EOS>
A
dog
growled
as
he
touched
the
handle
of
a
room
-
door
;
and
a
man
's
voice
demanded
who
was
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
me
,
Bill
;
only
me
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
Jew
looking
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bring
in
your
body
then
,
"
said
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lie
down
,
you
stupid
brute
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
the
devil
when
he
's
got
a
great
-
coat
on
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Apparently
,
the
dog
had
been
somewhat
deceived
by
Mr
Fagin
's
outer
garment
;
for
as
the
Jew
unbuttoned
it
,
and
threw
it
over
the
back
of
a
chair
,
he
retired
to
the
corner
from
which
he
had
risen
:
 
wagging
his
tail
as
he
went
,
to
show
that
he
was
as
well
satisfied
as
it
was
in
his
nature
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
---
"
Ah
!
Nancy
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
latter
recognition
was
uttered
with
just
enough
of
embarrassment
to
imply
a
doubt
of
its
reception
;
for
Mr
Fagin
and
his
young
friend
had
not
met
,
since
she
had
interfered
in
behalf
of
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
All
doubts
upon
the
subject
,
if
he
had
any
,
were
speedily
removed
by
the
young
lady
's
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
her
feet
off
the
fender
,
pushed
back
her
chair
,
and
bade
Fagin
draw
up
his
,
without
saying
more
about
it
:
 
<EOS>
for
it
was
a
cold
night
,
and
no
mistake
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
cold
,
Nancy
dear
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
as
he
warmed
his
skinny
hands
over
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
go
right
through
one
,
"
added
the
old
man
,
touching
his
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
a
piercer
,
if
it
finds
its
way
through
your
heart
,
"
said
Mr
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
him
something
to
drink
,
Nancy
.
 
<EOS>
Burn
my
body
,
make
haste
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
enough
to
turn
a
man
ill
,
to
see
his
lean
old
carcase
shivering
in
that
way
,
like
a
ugly
ghost
<EOS>
just
rose
from
the
grave
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nancy
quickly
brought
a
bottle
from
a
cupboard
,
in
which
there
were
many
:
 
which
,
to
judge
from
the
diversity
of
their
appearance
,
were
filled
with
several
kinds
of
liquids
.
 
<EOS>
Sikes
pouring
out
a
glass
of
brandy
,
bade
the
Jew
drink
it
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
enough
,
quite
,
thankye
,
Bill
,
"
replied
the
Jew
,
putting
down
the
glass
after
just
setting
his
lips
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
afraid
of
our
getting
the
better
of
you
,
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sikes
,
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
Jew
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ugh
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
a
hoarse
grunt
of
contempt
,
Mr
Sikes
seized
the
glass
,
and
threw
the
remainder
of
its
contents
into
the
ashes
:
as
a
preparatory
ceremony
to
filling
it
again
for
himself
:
 
which
he
did
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
glanced
round
the
room
,
as
his
companion
tossed
down
the
second
glassful
;
not
in
curiousity
,
for
he
had
seen
it
often
before
;
but
in
a
restless
and
suspicious
manner
habitual
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
meanly
furnished
apartment
,
with
nothing
but
the
contents
of
the
closet
to
induce
the
belief
that
its
occupier
was
anything
but
a
working
man
;
and
with
no
more
suspicious
articles
displayed
to
view
than
two
or
three
heavy
bludgeons
which
stood
in
a
corner
,
and
a
"
life
-
preserver
"
that
hung
over
the
chimney
-
piece
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
said
Sikes
,
smacking
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"
Now
I
'm
ready
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
For
business
?
"
inquired
the
Jew
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
business
,
"
replied
Sikes
;
"
so
say
what
you
've
got
to
say
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
About
the
crib
at
Chertsey
,
Bill
?
"
said
the
Jew
,
drawing
his
chair
forward
,
and
speaking
in
a
very
low
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Wot
about
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
know
what
I
mean
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
Jew
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
knows
what
I
mean
,
Nancy
;
do
n't
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
do
n't
,
"
sneered
Mr
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Or
he
wo
n't
,
and
that
's
the
same
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Speak
out
,
and
call
things
by
their
right
names
;
do
n't
sit
there
,
winking
and
blinking
,
and
talking
to
me
in
hints
,
as
if
you
warn't
<EOS>
the
very
first
that
thought
about
the
robbery
.
 
<EOS>
Wot
d'ye
mean
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
Bill
,
hush
!
"
said
the
Jew
,
who
had
in
vain
attempted
to
stop
this
burst
of
indignation
;
"
somebody
will
hear
us
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Somebody
will
hear
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
'em
hear
!
"
<EOS>
said
Sikes
;
"
I
do
n't
care
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
as
Mr
Sikes
DID
care
,
on
reflection
,
he
dropped
his
voice
as
he
said
the
words
,
and
grew
calmer
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
there
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
coaxingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
only
my
caution
,
nothing
more
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
,
about
that
crib
at
Chertsey
;
when
is
it
to
be
done
,
Bill
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
When
is
it
to
be
done
?
 
<EOS>
Such
plate
,
my
dear
,
such
plate
!
"
said
the
Jew
:
 
rubbing
his
hands
,
and
elevating
his
eyebrows
in
a
rapture
of
anticipation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
replied
Sikes
coldly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
to
be
done
at
all
!
"
echoed
the
Jew
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
at
all
,
"
rejoined
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
least
it
ca
n't
be
a
put
-
up
job
,
as
we
expected
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
it
has
n't
been
properly
gone
about
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
turning
pale
with
anger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
tell
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
tell
you
,
"
retorted
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
that
's
not
to
be
told
?
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
that
Toby
Crackit
has
been
hanging
about
the
place
for
a
fortnight
,
and
he
ca
n't
get
one
of
the
servants
in
line
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
,
Bill
,
"
said
the
Jew
:
softening
as
the
other
grew
heated
:
 
"
that
neither
of
the
two
men
in
the
house
can
be
got
over
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
mean
to
tell
you
so
,
"
replied
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
old
lady
has
had
'em
these
twenty
years
;
and
if
you
were
to
give
'em
five
hundred
pound
,
they
would
n't
be
in
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
do
you
mean
to
say
,
my
dear
,
"
remonstrated
the
Jew
,
"
that
the
women
ca
n't
be
got
over
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
"
replied
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
by
flash
Toby
Crackit
?
"
said
the
Jew
incredulously
.
<EOS>
"
Think
what
women
are
,
Bill
,
"
   
"
No
;
not
even
by
flash
Toby
Crackit
,
"
replied
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
says
he
's
worn
sham
whiskers
,
and
a
canary
waistcoat
,
the
whole
blessed
time
he
's
been
loitering
down
there
,
and
it
's
all
of
no
use
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
should
have
tried
mustachios
and
a
pair
of
military
trousers
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
Jew
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
he
did
,
"
rejoined
Sikes
,
"
and
they
warn't
of
no
more
use
than
the
other
plant
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
looked
blank
at
this
information
.
 
<EOS>
After
ruminating
for
some
minutes
with
his
chin
sunk
on
his
breast
,
he
raised
his
head
and
said
,
with
a
deep
sigh
,
that
if
flash
Toby
Crackit
reported
aright
,
he
feared
the
game
was
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
dropping
his
hands
on
his
knees
,
"
it
's
a
sad
thing
,
my
dear
,
to
lose
so
much
when
we
had
set
our
hearts
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
it
is
,
"
said
Mr
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Worse
luck
!
"
   
<EOS>
A
long
silence
ensued
;
during
which
the
Jew
was
plunged
in
deep
thought
,
with
his
face
wrinkled
into
an
expression
of
villainy
perfectly
demoniacal
.
 
<EOS>
Sikes
eyed
him
furtively
from
time
to
time
.
 
<EOS>
Nancy
,
apparently
fearful
of
irritating
the
housebreaker
,
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
fire
,
as
if
she
had
been
deaf
to
all
that
passed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fagin
,
"
said
Sikes
,
abruptly
breaking
the
stillness
that
prevailed
;
"
is
it
worth
fifty
shiners
<EOS>
extra
,
if
it
's
safely
done
from
the
outside
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
as
suddenly
rousing
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
a
bargain
?
"
inquired
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
dear
,
yes
,
"
rejoined
the
Jew
;
his
eyes
glistening
,
and
every
muscle
in
his
face
working
,
with
the
excitement
that
the
inquiry
had
awakened
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
Sikes
,
thrusting
aside
the
Jew
's
hand
,
with
some
disdain
,
"
let
it
come
off
as
soon
as
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
Toby
and
me
were
over
the
garden
-
wall
the
night
afore
last
,
sounding
the
panels
of
the
door
and
shutters
.
 
<EOS>
The
crib
's
barred
up
at
night
like
a
jail
;
but
there
's
one
part
we
can
crack
,
safe
and
softly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Which
is
that
,
Bill
?
"
asked
the
Jew
eagerly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
whispered
Sikes
,
"
as
you
cross
the
lawn
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
Yes
?
"
said
the
Jew
,
bending
his
head
forward
,
with
his
eyes
almost
starting
out
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Umph
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sikes
,
stopping
short
,
as
the
girl
,
scarcely
moving
her
head
,
looked
suddenly
round
,
and
pointed
for
an
instant
to
the
Jew
's
face

"
Never
mind
which
part
it
is
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
do
it
without
me
,
I
know
;
but
it
's
best
to
be
on
the
safe
side
when
one
deals
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
you
like
,
my
dear
,
as
you
like
"
replied
the
Jew
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
there
no
help
wanted
,
but
yours
and
Toby
's
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
None
,
"
said
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Cept
a
centre
-
bit
and
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
we
've
both
got
;
the
second
you
must
find
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
boy
!
"
exclaimed
the
Jew
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
then
it
's
a
panel
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
wot
it
is
!
"
replied
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
a
boy
,
and
he
musn't
be
a
big
'
un
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
!
"
said
Mr
Sikes
,
reflectively
,
"
if
I
'd
only
got
that
young
boy
of
Ned
,
the
chimbley
-
sweeper
's
!
 
<EOS>
He
kept
him
small
on
purpose
,
and
let
him
out
by
the
job
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
father
gets
lagged
;
and
then
the
Juvenile
Delinquent
Society
comes
,
and
takes
the
boy
away
from
a
trade
where
he
was
arning
money
,
teaches
him
to
read
and
write
,
and
in
time
makes
a
'
prentice
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
they
go
on
,
"
said
Mr
Sikes
,
his
wrath
rising
with
the
recollection
of
his
wrongs
,
"
<EOS>
so
they
go
on
;
and
,
if
they
'd
got
money
enough
(
which
it
's
a
Providence
<EOS>
they
have
n't
,
)
we
should
n't
have
half
a
dozen
boys
left
in
the
whole
trade
,
in
a
year
or
two
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
more
we
should
,
"
acquiesed
the
Jew
,
who
had
been
considering
during
this
speech
,
and
had
only
caught
the
last
sentence
.
<EOS>
"
Bill
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
now
?
"
inquired
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
nodded
his
head
towards
Nancy
,
who
was
still
gazing
at
the
fire
;
and
intimated
,
by
a
sign
,
that
he
would
have
her
told
to
leave
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Sikes
shrugged
his
shoulders
impatiently
,
as
if
he
thought
the
precaution
unnecessary
;
but
complied
,
nevertheless
,
by
requesting
Miss
Nancy
to
fetch
him
a
jug
of
beer
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
want
any
beer
,
"
said
Nancy
,
folding
her
arms
,
and
retaining
her
seat
very
composedly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
"
rejoined
the
girl
coolly
,
"
Go
on
,
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
he
's
going
to
say
,
Bill
;
he
need
n't
mind
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
still
hesitated
.
 
<EOS>
Sikes
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
some
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
do
n't
mind
the
old
girl
,
do
you
,
Fagin
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
at
length
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
known
her
long
enough
to
trust
her
,
or
the
Devil
's
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
ai
n't
one
to
blab
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
Nancy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
\
<EOS>
I
\
should
think
not
!
"
replied
the
young
lady
:
 
drawing
her
chair
up
to
the
table
,
and
putting
her
elbows
upon
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
my
dear
<EOS>
,
I
know
you
're
not
,
"
said
the
Jew
;
"
<EOS>
but
---
"
and
again
the
old
man
paused
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
wot
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
whether
she
might
n't
p'r'aps
be
out
of
sorts
,
you
know
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
as
she
was
the
other
night
,
"
replied
the
Jew
.
   
<EOS>
At
this
confession
,
Miss
Nancy
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
;
and
,
swallowing
a
glass
of
brandy
,
shook
her
head
with
an
air
of
defiance
,
and
burst
into
sundry
exclamations
of
"
Keep
the
game
a
-
going
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
say
die
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
These
seemed
to
have
the
effect
of
re
-
assuring
both
gentlemen
;
for
the
Jew
nodded
his
head
with
a
satisfied
air
,
and
resumed
his
seat
:
as
did
Mr
Sikes
likewise
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Fagin
,
"
said
Nancy
with
a
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
Bill
at
once
,
about
Oliver
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
you
're
a
clever
one
,
my
dear
:
<EOS>
the
sharpest
girl
I
ever
saw
!
"
said
the
Jew
,
patting
her
on
the
neck
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
WAS
about
Oliver
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
speak
,
sure
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
about
him
?
"
demanded
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
the
boy
for
you
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
the
Jew
in
a
hoarse
whisper
;
laying
his
finger
on
the
side
of
his
nose
,
and
grinning
frightfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
!
"
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
him
,
Bill
!
"
said
Nancy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
,
if
I
was
in
your
place
.
<EOS>
He
may
n't
be
so
much
up
,
as
any
of
the
others
;
but
that
's
not
what
you
want
,
if
he
's
only
to
open
a
door
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
Depend
upon
it
<EOS>
he
's
a
safe
one
,
Bill
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
is
,
"
rejoined
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
been
in
good
training
these
last
few
weeks
,
and
it
's
time
he
began
to
work
for
his
bread
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
others
are
all
too
big
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
he
is
just
the
size
I
want
,
"
said
Mr
Sikes
,
ruminating
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
will
do
everything
you
want
,
Bill
,
my
dear
,
"
interposed
the
Jew
;
"
he
ca
n't
help
himself
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
,
if
you
frighten
him
enough
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Frighten
him
!
"
echoed
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
'll
be
no
sham
frightening
,
mind
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
's
anything
queer
about
him
when
we
once
get
into
the
work
;
in
for
a
penny
,
in
for
a
pound
.
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
see
him
alive
again
,
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
Think
of
that
,
before
you
send
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
my
words
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
robber
,
poising
a
crowbar
,
which
he
had
drawn
from
under
the
bedstead
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
thought
of
it
all
,
"
said
the
Jew
with
energy
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
---
I
've
had
my
eye
upon
him
,
my
dears
,
close
---
close
.
<EOS>
Once
let
him
feel
that
he
is
one
of
us
;
once
fill
his
mind
with
the
idea
that
he
has
been
a
thief
;
and
he
's
ours
!
 
<EOS>
Ours
for
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
Oho
!
 
<EOS>
It
could
n't
have
come
about
better
!
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
crossed
his
arms
upon
his
breast
;
and
,
drawing
his
head
and
shoulders
into
a
heap
,
literally
hugged
himself
for
joy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ours
!
"
said
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yours
,
you
mean
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
do
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
with
a
shrill
chuckle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mine
,
if
you
like
,
Bill
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
wot
,
"
said
Sikes
,
scowling
fiercely
on
his
agreeable
friend
,
"
wot
makes
you
take
so
much
pains
about
one
chalk
-
faced
kid
,
when
you
know
there
are
fifty
boys
snoozing
about
Common
Garden
every
night
,
as
you
might
pick
and
choose
from
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
they
're
of
no
use
to
me
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
the
Jew
,
with
some
confusion
,
"
not
worth
the
taking
.
 
<EOS>
Their
looks
convict
'em
when
they
get
into
trouble
,
and
I
lose
'em
all
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
boy
,
properly
managed
,
my
dears
,
I
could
do
what
I
could
n't
with
twenty
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
recovering
his
self
-
possession
,
"
he
has
us
now
if
he
could
only
give
us
leg
-
bail
again
;
and
he
must
be
in
the
same
boat
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
how
he
came
there
;
it
's
quite
enough
for
my
power
over
him
that
he
was
in
a
robbery
;
that
's
all
I
want
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
how
much
better
this
is
,
than
being
obliged
to
put
the
poor
leetle
boy
out
of
the
way
---
which
would
be
dangerous
,
and
we
should
lose
by
it
besides
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
is
it
to
be
done
?
"
asked
Nancy
,
stopping
some
turbulent
exclamation
on
the
part
of
Mr
Sikes
,
expressive
of
the
disgust
with
which
he
received
Fagin
's
affectation
of
humanity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
the
Jew
;
"
when
is
it
to
be
done
,
Bill
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
planned
with
Toby
,
the
night
arter
to
-
morrow
,
"
rejoined
Sikes
in
a
surly
voice
,
"
if
he
heerd
nothing
from
me
to
the
contrairy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
,
"
said
the
Jew
;
"
there
's
no
moon
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
rejoined
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
arranged
about
bringing
off
the
swag
,
is
it
?
"
asked
the
Jew
.
   
<EOS>
Sikes
nodded
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
about
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
ah
,
it
's
all
planned
,
"
rejoined
Sikes
,
interrupting
him
.
"
<EOS>
Never
mind
particulars
.
 
<EOS>
You
'd
better
bring
the
boy
here
to
-
morrow
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
get
off
the
stone
an
hour
arter
daybreak
.
 
<EOS>
Then
you
hold
your
tongue
,
and
keep
the
melting
-
pot
ready
,
and
that
's
all
you
'll
have
to
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
some
discussion
,
in
which
all
three
took
an
active
part
,
it
was
decided
that
Nancy
should
repair
to
the
Jew
's
next
evening
when
the
night
had
set
in
,
and
bring
Oliver
away
with
her
;
Fagin
craftily
observing
,
that
,
if
he
evinced
any
disinclination
to
the
task
,
he
would
be
more
willing
to
accompany
the
girl
who
had
so
recently
interfered
in
his
behalf
,
than
anybody
else
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
also
solemnly
arranged
that
poor
Oliver
should
,
for
the
purposes
of
the
contemplated
expedition
,
be
unreservedly
consigned
to
the
care
and
custody
of
Mr
William
Sikes
;
and
further
,
that
the
said
Sikes
should
deal
with
him
as
he
thought
fit
;
and
should
not
be
held
responsible
by
the
Jew
for
any
mischance
or
evil
that
might
be
necessary
to
visit
him
<EOS>
:
it
being
understood
that
,
to
render
the
compact
in
this
respect
binding
,
any
representations
made
by
Mr
Sikes
on
his
return
should
be
required
to
be
confirmed
and
corroborated
,
in
all
important
particulars
,
by
the
testimony
of
flash
Toby
Crackit
.
   
<EOS>
These
preliminaries
adjusted
,
Mr
Sikes
proceeded
to
drink
brandy
at
a
furious
rate
,
and
to
flourish
the
crowbar
in
an
alarming
manner
;
yelling
forth
,
at
the
same
time
,
most
unmusical
snatches
of
song
,
mingled
with
wild
execrations
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
in
a
fit
of
professional
enthusiasm
,
he
insisted
upon
producing
his
box
of
housebreaking
tools
:
 
which
he
had
no
sooner
stumbled
in
with
,
and
opened
for
the
purpose
of
explaining
the
nature
and
properties
of
the
various
implements
it
contained
,
and
the
peculiar
beauties
of
their
construction
,
than
he
fell
over
the
box
upon
the
floor
,
and
went
to
sleep
where
he
fell
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
Nancy
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
muffling
himself
up
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Their
eyes
met
,
and
the
Jew
scrutinised
her
,
narrowly
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
flinching
about
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
as
true
and
earnest
in
the
matter
as
Toby
Crackit
himself
could
be
.
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
again
bade
her
good
-
night
,
and
,
bestowing
a
sly
kick
upon
the
prostrate
form
of
Mr
Sikes
while
her
back
was
turned
,
groped
downstairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Always
the
way
!
<EOS>
"
muttered
the
Jew
to
himself
as
he
turned
homeward
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
worst
of
these
women
is
,
that
a
very
little
thing
serves
to
call
up
some
long
-
forgotten
feeling
;
and
,
the
best
of
them
is
,
that
it
never
lasts
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
 
<EOS>
The
man
against
the
child
,
for
a
bag
of
gold
!
"
   
<EOS>
Beguiling
the
time
with
these
pleasant
reflections
,
Mr
Fagin
wended
his
way
,
through
mud
and
mire
,
to
his
gloomy
abode
:
 
where
the
Dodger
was
sitting
up
,
impatiently
awaiting
his
return
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Oliver
a
-
bed
?
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
him
,
"
was
his
first
remark
as
they
descended
the
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hours
ago
,
"
replied
the
Dodger
,
throwing
open
a
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
he
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
boy
was
lying
,
fast
asleep
,
on
a
rude
bed
upon
the
floor
;
so
pale
with
anxiety
,
and
sadness
,
and
the
closeness
of
his
prison
,
that
he
looked
like
death
;
not
death
as
it
shows
in
shroud
and
coffin
,
but
in
the
guise
it
wears
when
life
has
just
departed
;
when
a
young
and
gentle
spirit
has
,
but
an
instant
,
fled
to
Heaven
,
and
the
gross
air
of
the
world
has
not
had
time
to
breathe
upon
the
changing
dust

Chapter
20

<EOS>
Wherein
Olver
is
delivered
over
to
Mr
William
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
When
Oliver
awoke
in
the
morning
,
he
was
a
good
deal
surprised
to
find
that
a
new
pair
of
shoes
,
with
strong
thick
soles
,
had
been
placed
at
his
bedside
;
and
that
his
old
shoes
had
been
removed
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
he
was
pleased
with
the
discovery
:
hoping
that
it
might
be
the
forerunner
of
his
release
;
but
such
thoughts
were
quickly
dispelled
,
on
his
sitting
down
to
breakfast
along
with
the
Jew
,
who
told
him
,
in
a
tone
and
manner
which
increased
his
alarm
,
that
he
was
to
be
taken
to
the
residence
of
Bill
Sikes
that
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
---
to
---
stop
there
,
sir
?
"
asked
Oliver
,
anxiously
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Not
to
stop
there
,
"
replied
the
Jew
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
should
n't
like
to
lose
you
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afraid
,
Oliver
,
you
shall
come
back
to
us
again
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
 
<EOS>
We
wo
n't
be
so
cruel
as
to
send
you
away
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
no
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
,
who
was
stooping
over
the
fire
toasting
a
piece
of
bread
,
looked
round
as
he
bantered
Oliver
thus
;
and
chuckled
as
if
to
show
that
he
knew
he
would
still
be
very
glad
to
get
away
if
he
could
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
fixing
his
eyes
on
Oliver
,
"
you
want
to
know
what
you
're
going
to
Bill
's
for
---
-eh
,
my
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
coloured
,
involuntarily
,
to
find
that
the
old
thief
had
been
reading
his
thoughts
;
but
boldly
said
,
Yes
,
he
did
want
to
know
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
do
you
think
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Fagin
,
parrying
the
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
do
n't
know
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
Jew
,
turning
away
with
a
disappointed
countenance
from
a
close
perusal
of
the
boy
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wait
till
Bill
tells
you
,
then
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
seemed
much
vexed
by
Oliver
's
not
expressing
any
greater
curiosity
on
the
subject
;
but
the
truth
is
,
that
,
although
Oliver
felt
very
anxious
,
he
was
too
much
confused
by
the
earnest
cunning
of
Fagin
's
looks
,
and
his
own
speculations
,
to
make
any
further
inquiries
just
then
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
other
opportunity
:
 
for
the
Jew
remained
very
surly
and
silent
till
night
:
 
when
he
prepared
to
go
abroad
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
burn
a
candle
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
putting
one
upon
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
here
's
a
book
for
you
to
read
,
till
they
come
to
fetch
you
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
night
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
!
"
replied
Oliver
,
softly
.
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
walked
to
the
door
:
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
the
boy
as
he
went
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
stopping
,
he
called
him
by
his
name
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
looked
up
;
the
Jew
,
pointing
to
the
candle
,
motioned
him
to
light
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
so
;
and
,
as
he
placed
the
candlestick
upon
the
table
,
saw
that
the
Jew
was
gazing
fixedly
at
him
,
with
lowering
and
contracted
brows
,
from
the
dark
end
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
heed
,
Oliver
!
<EOS>
take
heed
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
old
man
,
shaking
his
right
hand
before
him
in
a
warning
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
rough
man
,
and
thinks
nothing
of
blood
when
his
own
is
up
.
<EOS>
Whatever
falls
out
,
say
nothing
;
and
do
what
he
bids
you
.
 
<EOS>
Mind
!
"
 
<EOS>
Placing
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
last
word
,
he
suffered
his
features
gradually
to
resolve
themselves
into
a
ghastly
grin
,
and
,
nodding
his
head
,
left
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hand
when
the
old
man
disappeared
,
and
pondered
,
with
a
trembling
heart
,
on
the
words
he
had
just
heard
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
he
thought
of
the
Jew
's
admonition
,
the
more
he
was
at
a
loss
to
divine
its
real
purpose
and
meaning
.
   
<EOS>
He
could
think
of
no
bad
object
to
be
attained
by
sending
him
to
Sikes
,
which
would
not
be
equally
well
answered
by
his
remaining
with
Fagin
;
and
after
meditating
for
a
long
time
,
concluded
that
he
had
been
selected
to
perform
some
ordinary
menial
offices
for
the
housebreaker
,
until
another
boy
,
better
suited
for
his
purpose
could
be
engaged
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
too
well
accustomed
to
suffering
,
and
had
suffered
too
much
where
he
was
,
to
bewail
the
prospect
of
change
very
severely
.
 
<EOS>
He
remained
lost
in
thought
for
some
minutes
;
and
then
,
with
a
heavy
sigh
,
snuffed
the
candle
,
and
,
taking
up
the
book
which
the
Jew
had
left
with
him
,
began
to
read
.
   
<EOS>
He
turned
over
the
leaves
.
 
<EOS>
Carelessly
at
first
;
but
,
lighting
on
a
passage
which
attracted
his
attention
,
he
soon
became
intent
upon
the
volume
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
history
of
the
lives
and
trials
of
great
criminals
;
and
the
pages
were
soiled
and
thumbed
with
use
.
<EOS>
Here
,
he
read
of
dreadful
crimes
that
made
the
blood
run
cold
;
of
secret
murders
that
had
been
committed
by
the
lonely
wayside
;
of
bodies
hidden
from
the
eye
of
man
in
deep
pits
and
wells
:
which
would
not
keep
them
down
,
deep
as
they
were
,
but
had
yielded
them
up
at
last
,
after
many
years
,
and
so
maddened
the
murderers
with
the
sight
,
that
in
their
horror
they
had
confessed
their
guilt
,
and
yelled
for
the
gibbet
to
end
their
agony
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
too
,
he
read
of
men
who
,
lying
in
their
beds
at
dead
of
night
,
had
been
tempted
(
so
they
said
)
and
led
on
,
by
their
own
bad
thoughts
,
to
such
dreadful
bloodshed
as
it
made
the
flesh
creep
,
and
the
limbs
quail
,
to
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
The
terrible
descriptions
were
so
real
and
vivid
,
that
the
sallow
pages
seemed
to
turn
red
with
gore
;
and
the
words
upon
them
,
to
be
sounded
in
his
ears
,
as
if
they
were
whispered
,
in
hollow
murmers
,
by
the
spirits
of
the
dead
.
   
<EOS>
In
a
paroxysm
of
fear
,
the
boy
closed
the
book
,
and
thrust
it
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
falling
upon
his
knees
,
he
prayed
Heaven
to
spare
him
from
such
deeds
;
and
rather
to
will
that
he
should
die
at
once
,
than
be
reserved
for
crimes
,
so
fearful
and
appaling
.
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
he
grew
more
calm
,
and
besought
,
in
a
low
and
broken
voice
,
that
he
might
be
rescued
from
his
present
dangers
;
and
that
if
any
aid
were
to
be
raised
up
for
a
poor
outcast
boy
who
had
never
known
the
love
of
friends
or
kindred
,
it
might
come
to
him
now
,
when
,
desolate
and
deserted
,
he
stood
alone
in
the
midst
of
wickedness
and
guilt
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
concluded
his
prayer
,
but
still
remained
with
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
,
when
a
rustling
noise
aroused
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
starting
up
,
and
catching
sight
of
a
figure
standing
by
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
's
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Me
.
 
<EOS>
Only
me
,
"
replied
a
tremulous
voice
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
raised
the
candle
above
his
head
:
and
looked
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Nancy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Put
down
the
light
,
"
said
the
girl
,
turning
away
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
It
hurts
my
eyes
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
saw
that
she
was
very
pale
,
and
gently
inquired
if
she
were
ill
.
 
<EOS>
The
girl
threw
herself
into
a
chair
,
with
her
back
towards
him
:
 
and
wrung
her
hands
;
but
made
no
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
God
forgive
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
after
a
while
,
"
I
never
thought
of
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Has
anything
happened
?
"
asked
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
I
help
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
if
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
;
caught
her
throat
;
and
,
uttering
a
gurgling
sound
,
gasped
for
breath
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nancy
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Oliver
,
"
<EOS>
What
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
girl
beat
her
hands
upon
her
knees
,
and
her
feet
upon
the
ground
;
and
,
suddenly
stopping
,
drew
her
shawl
close
round
her
:
and
shivered
with
cold
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
stirred
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Drawing
her
chair
close
to
it
,
she
sat
there
,
for
a
little
time
,
without
speaking
;
but
at
length
she
raised
her
head
,
and
looked
round
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
comes
over
me
sometimes
,
"
said
she
,
affecting
to
busy
herself
in
arranging
her
dress
;
"
it
's
this
damp
dirty
room
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Nolly
,
dear
,
are
you
ready
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
go
with
you
?
"
asked
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
come
from
Bill
,
"
replied
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
to
go
with
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
for
?
"
asked
Oliver
,
recoiling
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
for
?
"
echoed
the
girl
,
raising
her
eyes
,
and
averting
them
again
,
the
moment
they
encountered
the
boy
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
 
For
no
harm
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
it
,
"
said
Oliver
:
 
who
had
watched
her
closely
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
it
your
own
way
,
"
rejoined
the
girl
,
affecting
to
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
no
good
,
then
.
"
   
Oliver
could
see
that
he
had
some
power
over
the
girl
's
better
feelings
,
and
,
for
an
instant
,
thought
of
appealing
to
her
compassion
for
his
helpless
state
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
then
,
the
thought
darted
across
his
mind
that
it
was
barely
eleven
o'clock
;
and
that
many
people
were
still
in
the
streets
:
 
of
whom
surely
some
might
be
found
to
give
credence
to
his
tale
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
reflection
occured
to
him
,
he
stepped
forward
:
 
and
said
,
somewhat
hastily
,
that
he
was
ready
.
   
<EOS>
Neither
his
brief
consideration
,
nor
its
purport
,
was
lost
on
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
She
eyed
him
narrowly
,
while
he
spoke
;
and
cast
upon
him
a
look
of
intelligence
which
sufficiently
showed
that
she
guessed
what
had
been
passing
in
his
thoughts
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
said
the
girl
,
stooping
over
him
,
and
pointing
to
the
door
as
she
looked
cautiously
round
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
help
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
have
tried
hard
for
you
,
but
all
to
no
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
hedged
round
and
round
.
 
<EOS>
If
ever
you
are
to
get
loose
from
here
,
this
is
not
the
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
Struck
by
the
energy
of
her
manner
,
Oliver
looked
up
in
her
face
with
great
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
speak
the
truth
;
her
countenance
was
white
and
agitated
;
and
she
trembled
with
very
earnestness
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
saved
you
from
being
ill
-
used
once
,
and
I
will
again
,
and
I
do
now
,
"
continued
the
girl
aloud
;
"
for
those
who
would
have
fetched
you
,
if
I
had
not
,
would
have
been
far
more
rough
than
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
promised
for
your
being
quiet
and
silent
;
if
you
are
not
,
you
will
only
do
harm
to
yourself
and
me
too
,
and
perhaps
be
my
death
.
 
<EOS>
See
here
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
borne
all
this
for
you
already
,
as
true
as
God
sees
me
show
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
pointed
,
hastily
,
to
some
livid
bruises
on
her
neck
and
arms
;
and
continued
,
with
great
rapidity
:
   
<EOS>
"
Remember
this
!
 
<EOS>
And
do
n't
let
me
suffer
more
for
you
,
just
now
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
help
you
,
I
would
;
but
I
have
not
the
power
.
 
<EOS>
They
do
n't
mean
to
harm
you
;
whatever
they
make
you
do
,
is
no
fault
of
yours
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
Every
word
from
you
is
a
blow
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
your
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Make
haste
!
 
<EOS>
Your
hand
!
   
<EOS>
She
caught
the
hand
which
Oliver
instinctively
placed
in
hers
,
and
,
blowing
out
the
light
,
drew
him
after
her
up
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
opened
,
quickly
,
by
some
one
shrouded
in
the
darkness
,
and
was
as
quickly
closed
,
when
they
had
passed
out
.
 
<EOS>
A
hackney
-
cabriolet
was
in
waiting
;
with
the
same
vehemence
which
she
had
exhibited
in
addressing
Oliver
,
the
girl
pulled
him
in
with
her
,
and
drew
the
curtains
close
.
 
<EOS>
The
driver
wanted
no
directions
,
but
lashed
his
horse
into
full
speed
,
without
the
delay
of
an
instant
.
   
<EOS>
The
girl
still
held
Oliver
fast
by
the
hand
,
and
continued
to
pour
into
his
ear
,
the
warnings
and
assurances
she
had
already
imparted
.
 
<EOS>
All
was
so
quick
and
hurried
,
that
he
had
scarcely
time
to
recollect
where
he
was
,
or
how
he
came
there
,
when
to
carriage
stopped
at
the
house
to
which
the
Jew
's
steps
had
been
directed
on
the
previous
evening
.
   
<EOS>
For
one
brief
moment
,
Oliver
cast
a
hurried
glance
along
the
empty
street
,
and
a
cry
for
help
hung
upon
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
girl
's
voice
was
in
his
ear
,
beseeching
him
in
such
tones
of
agony
to
remember
her
,
that
he
had
not
the
heart
to
utter
it
.
<EOS>
While
he
hesitated
,
the
opportunity
was
gone
;
he
was
already
in
the
house
,
and
the
door
was
shut
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
way
,
"
said
the
girl
,
releasing
her
hold
for
the
first
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bill
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hallo
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Sikes
:
appearing
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
,
with
a
candle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
time
of
day
.
 
<EOS>
Come
on
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
a
very
strong
expression
of
approbation
,
an
uncommonly
hearty
welcome
,
from
a
person
of
Mr
Sikes
'
temperament
.
 
<EOS>
Nancy
,
appearing
much
gratified
thereby
,
saluted
him
cordially
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bull's
-
eye
's
gone
home
with
Tom
,
"
observed
Sikes
,
as
he
lighted
them
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
'd
have
been
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
"
rejoined
Nancy
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
you
've
got
the
kid
,
"
said
Sikes
when
they
had
all
reached
the
room
:
closing
the
door
as
he
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
here
he
is
,
"
replied
Nancy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
he
come
quiet
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Like
a
lamb
,
"
rejoined
Nancy
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
said
Sikes
,
looking
grimly
at
Oliver
;
"
for
the
sake
of
his
young
carcase
:
 
as
would
otherways
have
suffered
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Come
here
,
young
'
un
;
and
let
me
read
you
a
lectur
'
,
which
is
as
well
got
over
at
once
.
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
addressing
his
new
pupil
,
Mr
Sikes
pulled
off
Oliver
's
cap
and
threw
it
into
a
corner
;
and
then
,
taking
him
by
the
shoulder
,
sat
himself
down
by
the
table
,
and
stood
the
boy
in
front
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
first
:
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
wot
<EOS>
this
is
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sikes
,
taking
up
a
pocket
-
pistol
which
lay
on
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
look
here
,
"
continued
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
powder
;
that
'
ere
's
a
bullet
;
and
this
is
a
little
bit
of
a
old
hat
for
waddin
'
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
murmured
his
comprehension
of
the
different
bodies
referred
to
;
and
Mr
Sikes
proceeded
to
load
the
pistol
,
with
great
nicety
and
deliberation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
it
's
loaded
,
"
said
Mr
Sikes
,
when
he
had
finished
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
see
it
is
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
the
robber
,
grasping
Oliver
's
wrist
,
and
putting
the
barrel
so
close
to
his
temple
that
they
touched
;
at
which
moment
the
boy
could
not
repress
a
start
;
"
if
you
speak
a
word
when
you
're
out
o
'
doors
with
me
,
except
when
I
speak
to
you
,
that
loading
will
be
in
your
head
without
notice
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
if
you
DO
make
up
your
mind
to
speak
without
leave
,
say
your
prayers
first
.
"
   
<EOS>
Having
bestowed
a
scowl
upon
the
object
of
this
warning
,
to
increase
its
effect
,
Mr
Sikes
continued
.
   
<EOS>
"
As
near
as
I
know
,
there
is
n't
anybody
as
would
be
asking
very
partickler
arter
<EOS>
you
,
if
you
WAS
disposed
of
;
so
I
need
n't
take
this
devil
-
and
-
all
of
trouble
to
explain
matters
to
you
,
if
it
warn't
<EOS>
for
you
own
good
.
 
<EOS>
D'ye
hear
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
short
and
the
long
of
what
you
mean
,
"
said
Nancy
:
 
speaking
very
emphatically
,
and
slightly
frowning
at
Oliver
as
if
to
bespeak
his
serious
attention
to
her
words
:
 
"
is
,
that
if
you
're
crossed
by
him
in
this
job
you
have
on
hand
,
you
'll
prevent
his
ever
telling
tales
afterwards
,
by
shooting
him
through
the
head
,
and
will
take
your
chance
of
swinging
for
it
,
as
you
do
for
a
great
many
other
things
in
the
way
of
business
,
every
month
of
your
life
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
!
"
<EOS>
observed
Mr
Sikes
,
approvingly
;
"
women
can
always
put
things
in
fewest
words
.
<EOS>
---
  
<EOS>
Except
when
it
's
blowing
up
;
and
then
they
lengthens
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
that
he
's
thoroughly
up
to
it
,
let
's
have
some
supper
,
and
get
a
snooze
before
starting
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
pursuance
of
this
request
,
Nancy
quickly
laid
the
cloth
;
disappearing
for
a
few
minutes
,
she
presently
returned
with
a
pot
of
porter
and
a
dish
of
sheep
's
heads
:
which
gave
occasion
to
several
pleasant
witticisms
on
the
part
of
Mr
Sikes
,
founded
upon
the
singular
coincidence
of
"
jemmies
"
being
a
can
name
,
common
to
them
,
and
also
to
an
ingenious
implement
much
used
in
his
profession
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
worthy
gentleman
,
stimulated
perhaps
by
the
immediate
prospect
of
being
on
active
service
,
was
in
great
spirits
and
good
humour
;
in
proof
whereof
,
it
may
be
here
remarked
,
that
he
humorously
drank
all
the
beer
at
a
draught
,
and
did
not
utter
,
on
a
rough
calculation
,
more
than
four
-
score
oaths
during
the
whole
progress
of
the
meal
.
   
<EOS>
Supper
being
ended
---
it
may
be
easily
conceived
that
Oliver
had
no
great
appetite
for
it
---
Mr
Sikes
disposed
of
a
couple
of
glasses
of
spirits
and
water
,
and
threw
himself
on
the
bed
;
ordering
Nancy
,
with
many
imprecations
in
case
of
failure
,
to
call
him
at
five
precisely
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
stretched
himself
in
his
clothes
,
by
command
of
the
same
authority
,
on
a
mattress
upon
the
floor
;
and
the
girl
,
mending
the
fire
,
sat
before
it
,
in
readiness
to
rouse
them
at
the
appointed
time
.
   
<EOS>
For
a
long
time
Oliver
lay
awake
,
thinking
it
not
impossible
that
Nancy
might
seek
that
opportunity
of
whispering
some
further
advice
;
but
the
girl
sat
brooding
over
the
fire
,
without
moving
,
save
now
and
then
to
trim
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
Weary
with
watching
and
anxiety
,
he
at
length
fell
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
awoke
,
the
table
was
covered
with
tea
-
things
,
and
Sikes
was
thrusting
various
articles
into
the
pockets
of
his
great
-
coat
,
which
hung
over
the
back
of
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Nancy
was
busily
engaged
in
preparing
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
yet
daylight
;
for
the
candle
was
still
burning
,
and
it
was
quite
dark
outside
.
<EOS>
A
sharp
rain
,
too
,
was
beating
against
the
window
-
panes
;
and
the
sky
looked
black
and
cloudy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
then
!
"
growled
Sikes
,
as
Oliver
started
up
;
"
half
-
past
five
!
 
<EOS>
Look
sharp
,
or
<EOS>
you
'll
get
no
breakfast
;
for
it
's
late
as
it
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
was
not
long
in
making
his
toilet
;
having
taken
some
breakfast
,
he
replied
to
a
surly
inquiry
from
Sikes
,
by
saying
that
he
was
quite
ready
.
   
<EOS>
Nancy
,
scarcely
looking
at
the
boy
,
threw
him
a
handkerchief
to
tie
round
his
throat
;
Sikes
gave
him
a
large
rough
cape
to
button
over
his
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
attired
,
he
gave
his
hand
to
the
robber
,
who
,
merely
pausing
to
show
him
with
a
menacing
gesture
that
he
had
that
same
pistol
in
a
side
-
pocket
of
his
great
-
coat
,
clasped
it
firmly
in
his
,
and
,
exchanging
a
farewell
with
Nancy
,
led
him
away
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
turned
,
for
an
instant
,
when
they
reached
the
door
,
in
the
hope
of
meeting
a
look
from
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
had
resumed
her
old
seat
in
front
of
the
fire
,
and
sat
,
perfectly
motionless
before
it
.

Chapter
21
.
<EOS>
The
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
cheerless
morning
when
they
got
into
the
street
;
blowing
and
raining
hard
;
and
the
clouds
looking
dull
and
stormy
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
had
been
very
wet
:
large
pools
of
water
had
collected
in
the
road
:
and
the
kennels
were
overflowing
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
faint
glimmering
of
the
coming
day
in
the
sky
;
but
it
rather
aggrevated
than
relieved
the
gloom
of
the
scene
:
 
the
sombre
light
only
serving
to
pale
that
which
<EOS>
the
street
lamps
afforded
,
without
shedding
any
warmer
or
brighter
tints
upon
the
wet
house
-
tops
,
and
dreary
streets
.
 
<EOS>
There
appeared
to
be
nobody
stirring
in
that
quarter
of
the
town
;
the
windows
of
the
houses
were
all
closely
shut
;
and
the
streets
through
which
they
passed
,
were
noiseless
and
empty
.
   
<EOS>
By
the
time
they
had
turned
into
the
Bethnal
Green
Road
,
the
day
had
fairly
begun
to
break
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
the
lamps
were
already
extinguished
;
a
few
country
waggons
were
slowly
toiling
on
,
towards
London
;
now
and
then
,
a
stage
-
coach
,
covered
with
mud
,
rattled
briskly
by
:
the
driver
bestowing
,
as
he
passed
,
and
admonitory
lash
upon
the
heavy
waggoner
who
,
by
keeping
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
road
,
had
endangered
his
arriving
at
the
office
,
a
quarter
of
a
minute
after
his
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
public
-
houses
,
with
gas
-
lights
burning
inside
,
were
already
open
.
 
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
other
shops
began
to
be
unclosed
,
and
a
few
scattered
people
were
met
with
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
came
straggling
groups
of
labourers
going
to
their
work
;
then
,
men
and
women
with
fish
-
baskets
on
their
heads
;
donkey
-
carts
laden
with
vegetables
;
chaise
-
carts
filled
with
live
-
stock
or
whole
carcasses
of
meat
;
milk
-
women
with
pails
;
an
unbroken
concourse
of
people
,
trudging
out
with
various
supplies
to
the
eastern
suburbs
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
approached
the
City
,
the
noise
and
traffic
gradually
increased
;
when
they
threaded
the
streets
between
Shoreditch
and
Smithfield
,
it
had
swelled
into
a
roar
of
sound
and
bustle
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
as
light
as
it
was
likely
to
be
,
till
night
came
on
again
,
and
the
busy
morning
of
half
<EOS>
the
London
population
had
begun
.
   
<EOS>
Turning
down
Sun
Street
and
Crown
Street
,
and
crossing
Finsbury
square
,
Mr
Sikes
struck
,
by
way
of
Chiswell
Street
,
into
Barbican
:
thence
into
Long
Lane
,
and
so
into
Smithfield
;
from
which
latter
place
arose
a
tumult
of
discordant
sounds
that
filled
Oliver
Twist
with
amazement
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
market
-
morning
.
 
<EOS>
The
ground
was
covered
,
nearly
ankle
-
deep
,
with
filth
and
mire
;
a
thick
steam
,
perpetually
rising
from
the
reeking
bodies
of
the
cattle
,
and
mingling
with
the
fog
,
which
seemd
to
rest
upon
the
chimney
-
tops
,
hung
heavily
above
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
pens
in
the
centre
of
the
large
area
,
and
as
many
temporary
pens
as
could
be
crowded
into
the
vacant
space
,
were
filled
with
sheep
;
tied
up
to
posts
by
the
gutter
side
were
long
lines
of
beasts
and
oxen
,
three
or
four
deep
.
 
<EOS>
Countrymen
,
butchers
,
drovers
,
hawkers
,
boys
,
thieves
,
idlers
,
and
vagabonds
of
every
low
grade
,
were
mingled
together
in
a
mass
;
the
whistling
of
drovers
,
the
barking
dogs
,
the
bellowing
and
plunging
of
the
oxen
,
the
bleating
of
sheep
,
the
grunting
and
squeaking
of
pigs
,
the
cries
of
hawkers
,
the
shouts
,
oaths
,
and
quarrelling
on
all
sides
;
the
ringing
of
bells
and
roar
of
voices
,
that
issued
from
every
public
-
house
;
the
crowding
,
pushing
,
driving
,
beating
,
whooping
and
yelling
;
the
hideous
and
discordant
dim
that
resounded
from
every
corner
of
the
market
;
and
the
unwashed
,
unshaven
,
squalid
,
and
dirty
figues
constantly
running
to
and
fro
,
and
bursting
in
and
out
of
the
throng
;
rendered
it
a
stunning
and
bewildering
scene
,
which
quite
confounded
the
senses
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sikes
,
dragging
Oliver
after
him
,
elbowed
his
way
through
the
thickest
of
the
crowd
,
and
bestowed
very
little
attention
on
the
numerous
sights
and
sounds
,
which
so
astonished
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
He
nodded
,
twice
or
thrice
,
to
a
passing
friend
;
and
,
resisting
as
many
invitations
to
take
a
morning
dram
,
pressed
steadily
onward
,
until
they
were
clear
of
the
turmoil
,
and
had
made
their
way
through
Hosier
Lane
into
Holborn
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
young
'
un
!
"
said
Sikes
,
looking
up
at
the
clock
of
St
Andrew
's
Church
,
"
hard
upon
seven
!
<EOS>
you
must
step
out
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
do
n't
lag
behind
already
,
Lazy
-
legs
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sikes
accompanied
this
speech
with
a
jerk
at
his
little
companion
's
wrist
;
Oliver
,
quickening
his
pace
into
a
kind
of
trot
between
a
fast
walk
and
a
run
,
kept
up
with
the
rapid
strides
of
the
house
-
breaker
as
well
as
he
could
.
   
<EOS>
They
held
their
course
at
this
rate
,
until
they
had
passed
Hyde
Park
corner
,
and
were
on
their
way
to
Kensington
:
 
when
Sikes
relaxed
his
pace
,
until
an
empty
cart
which
was
at
some
little
distance
behind
,
came
up
.
 
<EOS>
Seeing
"
Hounslow
"
written
on
it
<EOS>
,
he
asked
the
driver
with
as
much
civility
as
he
could
assume
,
if
he
would
give
them
a
lift
as
far
as
Isleworth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jump
up
,
"
said
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
that
your
boy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
he
's
my
boy
,
"
replied
Sikes
,
looking
hard
at
Oliver
,
and
putting
his
hand
abstractedly
into
the
pocket
where
the
pistol
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
father
walks
rather
too
quick
for
you
,
do
n't
he
,
my
man
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
driver
:
seeing
that
Oliver
was
out
of
breath
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
"
replied
Sikes
,
interposing
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
used
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
Here
,
take
hold
of
my
hand
,
Ned
.
 
<EOS>
In
with
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
addressing
Oliver
,
he
helped
him
into
the
cart
;
and
the
driver
,
pointing
to
a
heap
of
sacks
,
told
him
to
lie
down
there
,
and
rest
himself
.
   
<EOS>
As
they
passed
the
different
mile
-
stones
,
Oliver
wondered
,
more
and
more
,
where
his
companion
meant
to
take
him
.
 
<EOS>
Kensington
,
Hammersmith
,
Chiswick
,
Kew
Bridge
,
Brentford
,
were
all
passed
;
and
yet
they
went
on
as
steadily
as
if
they
had
only
just
begun
their
journey
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
they
came
to
a
public
-
house
called
the
Coach
and
Horses
;
a
little
way
beyond
which
,
another
road
appeared
to
run
off
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
,
the
cart
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
Sikes
dismounted
with
great
precipitation
,
holding
Oliver
by
the
hand
all
the
while
;
and
lifting
him
down
directly
,
bestowed
a
furious
look
upon
him
,
and
rapped
the
side
-
pocket
with
his
fist
,
in
a
significant
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
boy
,
"
said
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
sulky
,
"
replied
Sikes
,
giving
him
a
shake
;
"
he
's
sulky
.
 
<EOS>
A
young
dog
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
mind
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
I
!
"
rejoined
the
other
,
getting
into
his
cart
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
fine
day
,
after
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
drove
away
.
   
<EOS>
Sikes
waited
until
he
had
fairly
gone
;
and
then
,
telling
Oliver
he
might
look
about
him
if
he
wanted
,
once
again
led
him
onward
on
his
journey
.
   
<EOS>
They
turned
round
to
the
left
,
a
short
way
past
the
public
-
house
;
and
then
,
taking
a
right
-
hand
road
,
walked
on
for
a
long
time
:
passing
many
large
gardens
and
gentlemen
's
houses
on
both
sides
of
the
way
,
and
stopping
for
nothing
but
a
little
beer
,
until
they
reached
a
town
.
 
<EOS>
Here
against
the
wall
of
a
house
,
Oliver
saw
written
up
in
pretty
large
letters
,
"
Hampton
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
lingered
about
,
in
the
fields
,
for
some
hours
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
they
came
back
into
the
town
;
and
,
turning
into
an
old
public
-
house
with
a
defaced
sign
-
board
,
ordered
some
dinner
by
the
kitchen
fire
.
   
<EOS>
The
kitchen
was
an
old
,
low
-
roofed
room
;
with
a
great
beam
across
the
middle
of
the
ceiling
,
and
benches
,
with
high
backs
to
them
,
by
the
fire
;
on
which
were
seated
several
rough
men
in
smock
-
frocks
,
drinking
and
smoking
.
 
<EOS>
They
took
no
notice
of
Oliver
;
and
very
little
of
Sikes
;
and
,
as
Sikes
took
very
little
notice
of
the
,
he
and
his
young
comrade
sat
in
a
corner
by
themselves
,
without
being
much
troubled
by
their
company
.
   
<EOS>
They
had
some
cold
meat
for
dinner
,
and
sat
so
long
after
it
,
while
Mr
Sikes
indulged
himself
with
three
or
four
pipes
,
that
Oliver
began
to
feel
quite
certain
they
were
not
going
any
further
.
 
<EOS>
Being
much
tired
with
the
walk
,
and
getting
up
so
early
,
he
dozed
a
little
at
first
;
then
,
quite
overpowered
by
fatigue
and
the
fumes
of
the
tobacco
,
fell
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
quite
dark
when
he
was
awakened
by
a
push
from
Sikes
.
<EOS>
Rousing
himself
sufficiently
to
sit
up
and
look
about
him
,
he
found
that
worthy
in
close
fellowship
and
communication
with
a
labouring
man
,
over
a
pint
of
ale
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
,
you
're
going
on
to
Lower
Halliford
,
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
,
"
replied
the
man
,
who
seemed
a
little
the
worse
---
or
better
,
as
the
case
might
be
---
for
drinking
;
"
and
not
slow
about
it
neither
.
 
<EOS>
My
horse
has
n't
got
a
load
behind
him
going
back
,
as
he
had
coming
up
in
the
mornin
'
;
and
he
wo
n't
be
long
a
-
doing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
luck
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Ecod
!
<EOS>
he
's
a
good
'
un
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Could
you
give
my
boy
and
me
a
lift
as
far
as
there
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Sikes
,
pushing
the
ale
towards
his
new
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
're
going
directly
,
I
can
,
"
replied
the
man
,
looking
out
of
the
pot
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
Halliford
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Going
on
to
Shepperton
,
"
replied
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
your
man
,
as
far
as
I
go
,
"
replied
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
all
paid
,
Becky
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
the
other
gentleman
's
paid
,
"
replied
the
girl
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
"
said
the
man
,
with
tipsy
gravity
;
"
that
wo
n't
do
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
rejoined
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
-
going
to
accommodate
us
,
and
wot
's
to
prevent
my
standing
treat
for
a
pint
or
so
,
in
return
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
stranger
reflected
upon
this
argument
,
with
a
very
profound
face
;
having
done
so
,
he
seized
Sikes
by
the
hand
:
 
and
declared
he
was
a
real
good
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
To
which
Mr
Sikes
replied
,
he
was
joking
;
as
,
if
he
had
been
sober
,
there
would
have
been
strong
reason
to
suppose
he
was
.
   
<EOS>
After
the
exchange
of
a
few
more
compliments
,
they
bade
the
company
good
-
night
,
and
went
out
;
the
girl
gathering
up
the
pots
and
glasses
as
they
did
so
,
and
lounging
out
to
the
door
,
with
her
hands
full
,
to
see
the
party
start
.
   
<EOS>
The
horse
,
whose
health
had
been
drunk
in
his
absence
,
was
standing
outside
:
 
<EOS>
ready
harnessed
to
the
cart
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
and
Sikes
got
in
without
any
further
ceremony
;
and
the
man
to
whom
he
belonged
,
having
lingered
for
a
minute
or
two
"
to
bear
him
up
,
"
and
to
defy
the
hostler
and
the
world
to
produce
his
equal
,
mounted
also
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
hostler
was
told
to
give
the
horse
his
head
;
and
,
his
head
being
given
him
,
he
made
a
very
unpleasant
use
of
it
:
 
tossing
it
into
the
air
with
great
disdain
,
and
running
into
the
parlour
windows
over
the
way
;
after
performing
those
feats
,
and
supporting
himself
for
a
short
time
on
his
hind
-
legs
,
he
started
off
at
great
speed
,
and
rattled
out
of
the
town
right
gallantly
.
   
<EOS>
The
night
was
very
dark
.
 
<EOS>
A
damp
mist
rose
from
the
river
,
and
the
marshy
ground
about
;
and
spread
itself
over
the
dreary
fields
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
piercing
cold
,
too
;
all
was
gloomy
and
black
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
spoken
;
for
the
driver
had
grown
sleepy
;
and
Sikes
was
in
no
mood
to
lead
him
into
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
sat
huddled
together
,
in
a
corner
of
the
cart
;
bewildered
with
alarm
and
apprehension
;
and
figuring
strange
objects
in
the
gaunt
trees
,
whose
branches
waved
grimly
to
and
fro
,
as
if
in
some
fantastic
joy
at
the
desolation
of
the
scene
.
   
<EOS>
As
they
passed
Sunbury
Church
,
the
clock
struck
seven
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
light
in
the
ferry
-
house
window
opposite
:
 
which
streamed
across
the
road
,
and
threw
into
more
sombre
shadow
a
dark
yew
-
tree
with
graves
beneath
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
dull
sound
of
falling
water
not
far
off
;
and
the
leaves
of
the
old
tree
stirred
gently
in
the
night
wind
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
like
quiet
music
for
the
repose
of
the
dead
.
   
<EOS>
Sunbury
was
passed
through
,
and
they
came
again
into
the
lonely
road
.
 
<EOS>
Two
or
three
miles
more
,
and
the
cart
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
Sikes
alighted
,
took
Oliver
by
the
hand
,
and
they
once
again
walked
on
.
   
<EOS>
They
turned
into
no
house
at
Shepperton
,
as
the
weary
boy
had
expected
;
but
still
kept
walking
on
,
in
mud
and
darkness
,
through
gloomy
lanes
and
over
cold
open
wastes
,
until
they
came
within
sight
of
the
lights
of
a
town
at
no
great
distance
.
 
<EOS>
On
looking
intently
forward
,
Oliver
saw
that
the
water
was
just
below
them
,
and
that
they
were
coming
to
the
foot
of
a
bridge
.
   
<EOS>
Sikes
kept
straight
on
,
until
they
were
close
upon
the
bridge
;
then
turned
suddenly
down
a
bank
upon
the
left
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
water
!
<EOS>
"
thought
Oliver
,
turning
sick
with
fear
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
brought
me
to
this
lonely
place
to
murder
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
about
to
throw
himself
on
the
ground
,
and
make
one
struggle
for
his
young
life
,
when
he
saw
that
they
stood
before
a
solitary
house
:
all
ruinous
and
decayed
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
window
on
each
side
of
the
dilapidated
entrance
;
and
one
story
above
;
but
no
light
was
visible
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
was
dark
,
dismantled
:
and
the
all
appearance
,
uninhabited
.
   
<EOS>
Sikes
,
with
Oliver
's
hand
still
in
his
,
softly
approached
the
low
porch
,
and
raised
the
latch
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
yielded
to
the
pressure
,
and
they
passed
in
together
.

Chapter

<EOS>
The
burglary
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hallo
!
"
cried
a
loud
,
hoarse
voice
,
as
soon
as
they
set
foot
in
the
passage
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
make
such
a
row
,
"
said
Sikes
,
bolting
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Show
a
glim
,
Toby
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
<EOS>
my
pal
!
"
cried
the
same
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
glim
,
Barney
,
a
glim
!
<EOS>
Show
the
gentleman
in
,
Barney
;
wake
up
first
,
if
convenient
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
speaker
appeared
to
throw
a
boot
-
jack
,
or
some
such
article
,
at
the
person
he
addressed
,
to
rouse
him
from
his
slumbers
:
 
for
the
noise
of
a
wooden
body
,
falling
violently
,
was
heard
;
and
then
an
indistinct
muttering
,
as
of
a
man
between
sleep
and
awake
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
?
"
cried
the
same
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
Bill
Sikes
in
the
passage
with
nobody
to
do
the
civil
to
him
;
and
you
sleeping
there
,
as
if
you
took
laudanum
with
your
meals
,
and
nothing
stronger
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
any
fresher
now
,
or
do
you
want
the
iron
candlestick
to
wake
you
thoroughly
?
"
   
<EOS>
A
pair
of
slipshod
feet
shuffled
,
hastily
,
across
the
bare
floor
of
the
room
,
as
this
interrogatory
was
put
;
and
there
issued
,
from
a
door
on
the
right
hand
;
first
,
a
feeble
candle
:
 
and
next
,
the
form
of
the
same
individual
who
has
been
heretofore
described
as
labouring
under
the
infirmity
of
speaking
through
his
nose
,
and
officiating
as
waiter
at
the
public
-
house
on
Saffron
Hill
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bister
Sikes
!
"
exclaimed
Barney
,
with
real
or
counterfeit
joy
;
"
cub
i
d
,
sir
;
cub
<EOS>
i
d

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
!
<EOS>
you
get
on
first
,
"
said
Sikes
,
putting
Oliver
in
front
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quicker
!
<EOS>
or
I
shall
tread
upon
your
heels
.
"
   
<EOS>
Muttering
a
curse
upon
his
tardiness
,
Sikes
pushed
Oliver
before
him
;
and
they
entered
a
low
dark
room
with
a
smoky
fire
,
two
or
three
broken
chairs
,
a
table
,
and
a
very
old
couch
:
 
on
which
,
with
his
legs
much
higher
than
his
head
,
a
man
was
reposing
at
full
length
,
smoking
a
long
clay
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
a
smartly
-
cut
snuff
-
coloured
coat
,
with
large
brass
buttons
;
an
orange
neckerchief
;
a
coarse
,
staring
,
shawl
-
pattern
waistcoat
;
and
drab
breeches
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Crackit
(
for
he
it
was
)
had
no
very
great
quantity
of
hair
,
either
upon
his
head
or
face
;
but
what
he
had
,
was
of
a
reddish
dye
,
and
tortured
into
long
corkscrew
curls
,
through
which
he
occasionally
thrust
some
very
dirty
fingers
,
ornamented
with
large
common
rings
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
trifle
above
the
middle
size
,
and
apparently
rather
weak
in
the
legs
;
but
this
circumstance
by
no
means
detracted
from
his
own
admiration
of
his
top
-
boots
,
which
he
contemplated
,
in
their
elevated
situation
,
with
lively
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bill
,
my
boy
!
"
said
this
figure
,
turning
his
head
towards
the
door
,
"
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
almost
afraid
you
'd
given
it
up
:
 
in
which
case
I
should
have
made
a
personal
wentur
.
 
<EOS>
Hallo
!
"
   
<EOS>
Uttering
this
exclamation
in
a
tone
of
great
surprise
,
as
his
eyes
rested
on
Oliver
,
Mr
Toby
Crackit
brought
himself
into
a
sitting
posture
,
and
demanded
who
that
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
boy
.
 
<EOS>
Only
the
boy
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Sikes
,
drawing
a
chair
towards
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wud
of
Bister
Fagid
's
lads
,
"
exclaimed
Barney
,
with
a
grin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fagin
's
,
eh
!
"
exclaimed
Toby
,
looking
at
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wot
an
inwalable
boy
that
'll
make
,
for
the
old
ladies
'
pockets
in
chapels
!
 
<EOS>
His
mug
is
a
fortin
'
to
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
---
there
's
enough
of
that
,
"
interposed
Sikes
,
impatiently
;
and
stooping
over
his
recumbant
friend
,
he
whispered
a
few
words
in
his
ear
:
 
at
which
Mr
Crackit
laughed
immensely
,
and
honoured
Oliver
with
a
long
stare
of
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Sikes
,
as
he
resumed
his
seat
,
"
if
you
'll
give
us
something
to
eat
and
drink
while
we
're
waiting
,
you
'll
put
some
heart
in
us
;
or
in
me
,
at
all
events
.
 
<EOS>
Sit
down
by
the
fire
,
younker
,
and
rest
yourself
;
for
you
'll
have
to
go
out
with
us
again
to
-
night
,
though
not
very
far
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
looked
at
Sikes
,
in
mute
and
timid
wonder
;
and
drawing
a
stool
to
the
fire
,
sat
with
his
aching
head
upon
his
hands
,
scarcely
knowing
where
he
was
,
or
what
was
passing
around
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
,
"
said
Toby
,
as
the
young
Jew
placed
some
fragments
of
food
,
and
a
bottle
upon
the
table
,
 
"
Success
to
the
crack
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
rose
to
honour
the
toast
;
and
,
carefully
depositing
his
empty
pipe
in
a
corner
,
advanced
to
the
table
,
filled
a
glass
with
spirits
,
and
drank
off
its
contents
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sikes
did
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
drain
for
the
boy
,
"
said
Toby
,
half
-
filling
a
wine
-
glass
.
<EOS>
"
Down
with
it
,
innocence
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
"
said
Oliver
,
looking
piteously
up
into
the
man
's
face
;
"
indeed
,
I
---
"
   
"
Down
with
it
!
"
echoed
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
I
do
n't
know
what
's
good
for
you
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
him
to
drink
it
,
Bill
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
had
better
!
"
<EOS>
said
Sikes
clapping
his
hand
upon
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
Burn
my
body
,
if
he
is
n't
more
trouble
than
a
whole
family
of
Dodgers
.
 
<EOS>
Drink
it
,
you
perwerse
imp
;
drink
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
Frightened
by
the
menacing
gestures
of
the
two
men
,
Oliver
hastily
swallowed
the
contents
of
the
glass
,
and
immediately
fell
into
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
:
 
which
delighted
Toby
Crackit
and
Barney
,
and
even
drew
a
smile
from
the
surly
Mr
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
This
done
,
and
Sikes
having
satisfied
his
appetite
<EOS>
(
Oliver
could
eat
nothing
but
a
small
crust
of
bread
which
they
made
him
swallow
)
,
the
two
men
laid
themselves
down
on
chairs
for
a
short
nap
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
retained
his
stool
by
the
fire
;
Barney
wrapped
in
a
blanket
,
stretched
himself
on
the
floor
:
 
close
outside
the
fender
.
   
<EOS>
They
slept
,
or
appeared
to
sleep
,
for
some
time
;
<EOS>
nobody
stirring
but
Barney
,
who
rose
once
or
twice
to
throw
coals
on
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Oliver
fell
into
a
heavy
doze
:
 
imagining
himself
straying
along
the
gloomy
lanes
,
or
wandering
about
the
dark
churchyard
,
or
retracing
some
one
or
other
of
the
scenes
of
the
past
day
:
 
when
he
was
roused
by
Toby
Crackit
jumping
up
and
declaring
it
was
half
-
past
one
.
   
<EOS>
In
an
instant
,
the
other
two
were
on
their
legs
,
and
all
were
actively
engaged
in
busy
preparation
.
 
<EOS>
Sikes
and
his
companion
enveloped
their
necks
and
chins
in
large
dark
shawls
,
and
drew
on
their
great
-
coats
;
Barney
,
opening
a
cupboard
,
brought
forth
several
articles
,
which
he
hastily
crammed
into
the
pockets
.
   
<EOS>
"
Barkers
for
me
,
Barney
,
"
said
Toby
Crackit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
they
are
,
"
replied
Barney
,
producing
a
pair
of
pistols
.
<EOS>
"
You
loaded
them
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
right
!
"
replied
Toby
,
stowing
them
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
persuaders
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
'
em
,
"
replied
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Crape
,
keys
,
centre
-
bits
,
darkies
---
nothing
forgotten
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Toby
:
 
<EOS>
fastening
a
small
crowbar
to
a
loop
inside
the
skirt
of
his
coat
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
"
rejoined
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bring
them
bits
of
timber
,
Barney
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
time
of
day
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
he
took
a
thick
stick
from
Barney
's
hands
,
who
,
having
delivered
another
to
Toby
,
busied
himself
in
fastening
on
Oliver
's
cape
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
then
!
"
said
Sikes
,
holding
out
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
:
 
<EOS>
who
was
completely
stupified
by
the
unwonted
exercise
,
and
the
air
,
and
the
drink
which
had
been
forced
upon
him
:
 
put
his
hand
mechanically
into
that
which
Sikes
extended
for
the
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
his
other
hand
,
Toby
,
"
said
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
out
,
Barney
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
man
went
to
the
door
,
and
returned
to
announce
that
all
was
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
robbers
issued
forth
with
Oliver
between
them
.
<EOS>
Barney
,
having
made
all
fast
,
rolled
himself
up
as
before
,
and
was
soon
asleep
again
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
now
intensely
dark
.
 
<EOS>
The
fog
was
much
heavier
than
it
had
been
in
the
early
part
of
the
night
;
and
the
atmosphere
was
so
damp
,
that
,
although
no
rain
fell
,
Oliver
's
hair
and
eyebrows
,
within
a
few
minutes
after
leaving
the
house
,
had
become
stiff
with
the
half
-
frozen
moisture
that
was
floating
about
.
 
<EOS>
They
crossed
the
bridge
,
and
kept
on
towards
the
lights
which
he
had
seen
before
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
at
no
great
distance
off
;
and
,
as
they
walked
pretty
briskly
,
they
soon
arrived
at
Chertsey
.
   
<EOS>
"
Slap
through
the
town
,
"
whispered
Sikes
;
"
there
'll
be
nobody
in
the
way
,
to
-
night
,
to
see
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
Toby
acquiesced
;
and
they
hurried
through
the
main
street
of
the
little
town
,
which
at
that
late
hour
was
wholly
deserted
.
 
<EOS>
A
dim
light
shone
at
intervals
from
some
bed
-
room
window
;
and
the
hoarse
barking
of
dogs
occasionally
broke
the
silence
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
nobody
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
cleared
the
town
,
as
the
church
-
bell
struck
two
.
   
<EOS>
Quickening
their
pace
,
they
turned
up
a
road
upon
the
left
hand
.
<EOS>
After
walking
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
they
stopped
before
a
detached
house
surrounded
by
a
wall
:
 
to
the
top
of
which
,
Toby
Crackit
,
scarcely
pausing
to
take
breath
,
climbed
in
a
twinkling
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
boy
next
,
"
said
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hoist
him
up
;
I
'll
catch
hold
of
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Before
Oliver
had
time
to
look
round
,
Sikes
had
caught
him
under
the
arms
;
and
in
three
or
four
seconds
he
and
Toby
were
lying
on
the
grass
on
the
other
side
.
 
<EOS>
Sikes
followed
directly
.
 
<EOS>
And
they
stole
cautiously
towards
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
Oliver
,
well
-
nigh
mad
with
grief
and
terror
,
saw
that
housebreaking
and
robbery
,
if
not
murder
,
were
the
objects
of
the
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
He
clasped
his
hands
together
,
and
involuntarily
uttered
a
subdued
exclamation
of
horror
.
 
<EOS>
A
mist
came
before
his
eyes
;
the
cold
sweat
stood
upon
his
ashy
face
;
his
limbs
failed
him
;
and
he
sank
upon
his
knees
.
   
<EOS>
"
Get
up
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
Sikes
,
trembling
with
rage
,
and
drawing
the
pistol
from
his
pocket
;
"
Get
up
,
or
I
'll
strew
your
brains
upon
the
grass
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
for
God
's
sake
let
me
go
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Oliver
;
"
let
me
run
away
and
die
in
the
fields
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
never
come
near
London
;
never
,
never
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
pray
have
mercy
on
me
,
and
do
not
make
me
steal
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
love
of
all
the
bright
Angels
that
rest
in
Heaven
,
have
mercy
upon
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
man
to
whom
this
appeal
was
made
,
swore
a
dreadful
oath
,
and
had
cocked
the
pistol
,
when
Toby
,
striking
it
from
his
grasp
,
placed
his
hand
upon
the
boy
's
mouth
,
and
dragged
him
to
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
cried
the
man
;
"
it
wo
n't
answer
here
.
 
<EOS>
Say
another
word
,
and
I
'll
do
your
business
myself
with
a
crack
on
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
That
makes
no
noise
,
and
is
quite
as
certain
,
and
more
genteel
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
Bill
,
wrench
the
shutter
open
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
game
enough
now
<EOS>
,
I
'll
engage
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
seen
older
hands
of
his
age
took
the
same
way
,
for
a
minute
or
two
,
on
a
cold
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sikes
,
invoking
terrific
imprecations
upon
Fagin
's
head
for
sending
Oliver
on
such
an
errand
,
plied
the
crowbar
vigorously
,
but
with
little
noise
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
delay
,
and
some
assistance
from
Toby
,
the
shutter
to
which
he
had
referred
,
swung
open
on
its
hinges
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
lattice
window
,
about
five
feet
and
a
half
above
the
ground
,
at
the
back
of
the
house
:
 
which
belonged
to
a
scullery
,
or
small
brewing
-
place
,
at
the
end
of
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
The
aperture
was
so
small
,
that
the
inmates
had
probably
not
thought
it
worth
while
to
defend
it
more
securely
;
but
it
was
large
enough
to
admit
a
boy
of
Oliver
's
size
,
nevertheless
.
 
<EOS>
A
very
brief
exercise
of
Mr
Sike
's
art
,
sufficed
to
overcome
the
fastening
of
the
lattice
;
and
it
soon
stood
wide
open
also
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
listen
,
you
young
limb
,
"
whispered
Sikes
,
drawing
a
dark
lantern
from
his
pocket
,
and
throwing
the
glare
full
on
Oliver
's
face
;
"
I
'm
a
going
to
put
you
through
there
.
 
<EOS>
Take
this
light
;
go
softly
up
the
steps
<EOS>
straight
afore
you
,
and
along
the
little
hall
,
to
the
street
door
<EOS>
;
unfasten
it
,
and
let
us
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
bolt
at
the
top
,
you
wo
n't
be
able
to
reach
,
"
interposed
Toby
.
<EOS>
"
Stand
upon
one
of
the
hall
chairs
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
three
there
,
Bill
,
with
a
jolly
large
blue
unicorn
and
gold
pitchfork
on
'em
:
 
which
is
the
old
lady
's
arms
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Keep
quiet
,
ca
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
replied
Sikes
,
with
a
threatening
look
.
"
<EOS>
The
room
-
door
is
open
,
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wide
,
"
repied
Toby
,
after
peeping
in
to
satisfy
himself
.
<EOS>
"
The
game
of
that
is
,
that
they
always
leave
it
open
with
a
catch
,
so
that
the
dog
,
who
's
got
a
bed
in
here
,
may
walk
up
and
down
the
passage
when
he
feels
wakeful
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
Barney
'
ticed
him
away
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
So
neat
!
"
   
<EOS>
Although
Mr
Crackit
spoke
in
a
scarcely
audible
whisper
,
and
laughed
without
noise
,
Sikes
imperiously
commanded
him
to
be
silent
,
and
to
get
to
work
.
 
<EOS>
Toby
complied
,
by
first
producing
his
lantern
,
and
placing
it
on
the
ground
;
then
by
planting
himself
firmly
with
his
head
against
the
wall
beneath
the
window
,
and
his
hands
upon
his
knees
,
so
as
to
make
a
step
of
his
back
.
<EOS>
This
was
no
sooner
done
,
than
Sikes
,
mounting
upon
him
,
put
Oiver
gently
through
the
window
with
his
feet
first
;
and
,
without
leaving
hold
of
his
collar
,
planted
him
safely
on
the
floor
inside
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
this
lantern
,
"
said
Sikes
,
looking
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
the
stairs
afore
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
,
more
dead
than
alive
,
gasped
out
,
"
Yes
.
"
 
Sikes
,
pointing
to
the
street
-
door
with
the
pistol
-
barrel
,
briefly
advised
him
to
take
notice
that
he
was
within
shot
all
the
way
;
and
that
if
he
faltered
,
he
would
fall
dead
that
instant
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
done
in
a
minute
,
"
said
Sikes
,
in
the
same
low
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Directly
I
leave
go
of
you
,
do
your
work
.
 
<EOS>
Hark
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
whispered
the
other
man
.
   
<EOS>
They
listened
intently
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
said
Sikes
,
releasing
his
hold
of
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
the
short
time
he
had
had
to
collect
his
senses
,
the
boy
had
firmly
resolved
that
,
whether
he
died
in
the
attempt
or
not
,
he
would
make
one
effort
to
dart
upstairs
from
the
hall
,
and
alarm
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
Filled
with
this
idea
,
he
advanced
at
once
,
but
stealthiy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
back
!
"
<EOS>
suddenly
cried
Sikes
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
"
Back
!
<EOS>
back
!
"
   
<EOS>
Scared
by
the
sudden
breaking
of
the
dead
stillness
of
the
place
,
and
by
a
loud
cry
which
followed
it
,
Oliver
let
his
lantern
fall
,
and
knew
not
whether
to
advance
or
fly
.
   
<EOS>
The
cry
was
repeated
---
a
light
appeared
---
a
vision
of
two
terrified
half
-
dressed
men
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
swam
before
his
eyes
---
a
flash
---
a
loud
noise
---
a
smoke
---
a
crash
somewhere
,
but
where
he
knew
not
,
---
and
he
staggered
back
.
   
<EOS>
Sikes
had
disappeared
for
an
instant
;
but
he
was
up
again
,
and
had
him
by
the
collar
before
the
smoke
had
cleared
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
fired
his
own
pistol
after
the
men
,
who
were
already
retreating
;
and
dragged
the
boy
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Clasp
your
arm
tighter
,
"
said
Sikes
,
as
he
drew
him
through
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
me
a
shawl
here
.
 
<EOS>
They
've
hit
him
.
 
<EOS>
Quick
!
 
<EOS>
How
the
boy
bleeds
!
"
   
<EOS>
Then
came
the
loud
ringing
of
a
bell
,
mingled
with
the
noise
of
fire
-
arms
,
and
the
shouts
of
men
,
and
the
sensation
of
being
carried
over
uneven
ground
at
a
rapid
pace
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
the
noises
grew
confused
in
the
distance
;
and
a
cold
deadly
feeling
crept
over
the
boy
's
heart
;
and
he
saw
or
heard
no
more
.

Chapter
23
.
<EOS>
Which
contains
the
substance
of
a
pleasant
conversation
between
Mr
Bumble
and
a
lady
;
and
shows
that
even
a
beadle
may
be
susceptible
on
some
points
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
was
bitter
cold
.
 
<EOS>
The
snow
lay
on
the
ground
,
frozen
into
a
hard
thick
crust
,
so
that
only
the
heaps
that
had
drifted
into
byways
and
corners
were
affected
by
the
sharp
wind
that
howled
abroad
:
 
which
,
as
if
expending
increased
fury
on
such
prey
as
it
found
,
caught
it
savagely
up
in
clouds
,
and
,
whirling
it
into
a
thousand
misty
eddies
,
scattered
it
in
air
.
 
<EOS>
Bleak
,
dark
,
and
piercing
cold
<EOS>
,
it
was
a
night
for
the
well
-
housed
and
fed
to
draw
round
the
bright
fire
and
thank
God
they
were
at
home
;
and
for
the
homeless
,
starving
wretch
to
lay
him
down
and
die
.
 
<EOS>
Many
hunger
-
worn
outcasts
close
their
eyes
in
our
bare
streets
,
at
such
times
,
who
,
let
their
crimes
have
been
what
they
may
,
can
hardly
open
them
in
a
more
bitter
world
.
   
<EOS>
Such
was
the
aspect
of
out
-
of
-
doors
affairs
,
when
Mr
Corney
,
the
matron
of
the
workhouse
to
which
our
readers
have
been
already
introduced
as
the
birthplace
of
Oliver
Twist
,
sat
herself
down
before
a
cheerful
fire
in
her
own
little
room
,
and
glanced
,
with
no
small
degree
of
complacency
,
at
a
small
round
table
:
 
on
which
stood
a
tray
of
corresponding
size
,
furnished
with
all
necessary
materials
for
the
most
grateful
meal
that
matrons
enjoy
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
Mrs
Corney
was
about
to
solace
herself
with
a
cup
of
tea
.
<EOS>
As
she
glanced
from
the
table
to
the
fireplace
,
where
the
smallest
of
all
possible
kettles
was
singing
a
small
song
in
a
small
voice
,
her
inward
satisfaction
evidently
increased
,
---
so
much
so
,
indeed
,
that
Mrs
Corney
smiled
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
the
matron
,
leaning
her
elbow
on
the
table
,
and
looking
reflectively
at
the
fire
;
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
we
have
all
on
us
a
great
deal
to
be
grateful
for
!
 
<EOS>
A
great
deal
,
if
we
did
but
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Corney
shook
her
head
mournfully
,
as
if
deploring
the
mental
blindness
of
those
paupers
who
did
not
know
it
;
and
thrusting
a
silver
spoon
(
private
property
)
into
the
inmost
recesses
of
a
two
-
ounce
tin
tea
-
caddy
,
proceeded
to
make
the
tea
.
   
<EOS>
How
slight
a
thing
will
disturb
the
equanimity
of
our
frail
minds
!
 
<EOS>
The
black
teapot
,
being
very
small
and
easily
filled
,
ran
over
while
Mrs
Corney
was
moralising
;
and
the
water
slightly
scalded
Mrs
Corney
's
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Drat
the
pot
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
worthy
matron
,
setting
it
down
very
hastily
on
the
hob
;
"
a
little
stupid
thing
,
that
only
holds
a
couple
of
cups
!
 
<EOS>
What
use
is
it
of
,
to
anybody
!
 
<EOS>
Except
,
"
said
Mrs
Corney
,
pausing
,
"
except
to
a
poor
desolate
creature
like
me
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
the
matron
dropped
into
her
chair
,
and
,
once
more
resting
her
elbow
on
the
table
,
thought
of
her
solitary
fate
.
 
<EOS>
The
small
teapot
,
and
the
single
cup
,
had
awakened
in
her
mind
sad
recollections
of
Mr
Corney
(
who
had
not
been
dead
more
than
five
-
and
-
twenty
years
)
;
and
she
was
overpowered
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
get
another
!
"
said
Mrs
Corney
,
pettishly
;
"
I
shall
never
get
another
---
like
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Whether
this
remark
bore
reference
to
the
husband
,
or
the
teapot
,
is
uncertain
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
the
latter
;
for
Mrs
Corney
looked
at
it
as
she
spoke
;
and
took
it
up
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
just
tasted
her
first
cup
,
when
she
was
disturbed
by
a
soft
tap
at
the
room
-
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
come
in
with
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
Mrs
Corney
,
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Some
of
the
old
women
dying
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
They
always
die
when
I
'm
at
meals
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
stand
there
,
letting
the
cold
air
in
,
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
amiss
now
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
ma'am
,
nothing
,
"
replied
a
man
's
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
exclaimed
the
matron
,
in
a
much
sweeter
tone
,
"
is
that
Mr
Bumble
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
your
service
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
who
had
been
stopping
outside
to
rub
his
shoes
clean
,
and
to
shake
the
snow
off
his
coat
;
and
who
now
made
his
appearance
,
bearing
the
cocked
hat
in
one
hand
and
a
bundle
in
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
shut
the
door
,
ma'am
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
lady
modestly
hesitated
to
reply
,
lest
there
should
be
any
impropriety
in
holding
an
interview
with
Mr
Bumble
,
with
closed
doors
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
taking
advantage
of
the
hesitation
,
and
being
very
cold
himself
,
shut
it
without
permission
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hard
weather
,
Mr
Bumble
,
"
said
the
matron
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hard
,
indeed
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
the
beadle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Anti
-
porochial
weather
this
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
given
away
,
Mrs
Corney
,
we
have
given
away
a
matter
of
twenty
quartern
loaves
and
a
cheese
and
a
half
,
this
very
blessed
afternoon
;
and
yet
them
paupers
are
not
contented
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
.
 
<EOS>
When
would
they
be
,
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
matron
,
sipping
her
tea
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
,
indeed
,
ma'am
!
"
rejoined
Mr
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
here
's
one
man
that
,
in
consideraton
of
his
wife
and
large
family
,
has
a
quartern
loaf
and
a
good
pound
of
cheese
,
<EOS>
full
weight
.
 
<EOS>
Is
he
grateful
,
ma'am
?
 
<EOS>
Is
he
grateful
?
 
<EOS>
Not
a
copper
farthing
's
worth
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
What
does
he
do
,
ma'am
,
but
ask
for
a
few
coals
;
if
it
's
only
a
pocket
handkerchief
full
,
he
says
!
 
<EOS>
Coals
!
<EOS>
What
would
he
do
with
coals
?
 
<EOS>
Toast
his
cheese
with
'em
and
then
come
back
for
more
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
way
with
these
people
,
ma'am
;
give
'em
a
apron
full
of
coals
to
-
day
,
and
they
'll
come
back
for
another
,
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
,
as
brazen
as
alabaster
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
matron
expressed
her
entire
concurrence
in
this
intelligible
simile
;
and
the
beadle
went
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
"
see
anything
like
the
pitch
it
's
got
to
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
afore
yesterday
,
a
man
---
you
have
been
a
married
woman
,
ma'am
,
and
I
may
mention
it
to
you
---
a
man
,
with
hardly
a
rag
upon
his
back
<EOS>
(
here
Mrs
Corney
looked
at
the
floor
)
,
goes
to
our
overseer
's
door
when
he
has
got
company
coming
to
dinner
;
and
says
,
he
must
be
relieved
,
Mrs
Corney
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
would
n't
go
away
,
and
shocked
the
company
very
much
,
our
overseer
sent
him
out
a
pound
of
potatoes
and
half
a
pint
of
oatmeal
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
heart
!
"
says
the
ungrateful
villain
,
"
what
's
the
use
of
THIS
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
You
might
as
well
give
me
a
pair
of
iron
spectacles
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
says
our
overseer
,
taking
'em
away
again
,
"
you
wo
n't
get
anything
else
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
die
in
the
streets
!
"
says
the
vagrant
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
you
wo
n't
,
"
says
our
overseer
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
ha
!
 
<EOS>
That
was
very
good
!
 
<EOS>
So
like
Mr
Grannett
,
was
n't
it
?
"
<EOS>
interposed
the
matron
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr
Bumble
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
,
"
rejoined
the
beadle
,
"
he
went
away
;
and
he
DID
die
in
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
obstinate
pauper
for
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
beats
anything
I
could
have
believed
,
"
observed
the
matron
emphatically
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
do
n't
you
think
out
-
of
-
door
relief
a
very
bad
thing
,
any
way
,
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
?
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
gentleman
of
experience
,
and
ought
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
Come
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Corney
,
"
said
the
beadle
,
smiling
as
men
smile
who
are
conscious
of
superior
information
,
"
out
-
of
-
door
relief
,
properly
managed
,
ma'am
<EOS>
:
is
the
porochial
safeguard
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
principle
of
out
-
of
-
door
relief
is
,
to
give
the
paupers
exactly
what
they
do
n't
want
;
and
then
they
get
tired
of
coming
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Corney
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
that
is
a
good
one
,
too
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Betwixt
you
and
me
,
ma'am
,
"
returned
Mr
Bumble
,
"
<EOS>
that
's
the
great
principle
;
and
that
's
the
reason
why
,
if
you
look
at
any
cases
that
get
into
them
owdacious
newspapers
,
you
'll
always
observe
that
sick
families
have
been
relieved
with
slices
of
cheese
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
rule
now
,
Mrs
Corney
,
all
over
the
country
.
<EOS>
But
,
however
,
"
said
the
beadle
,
stopping
to
unpack
his
bundle
,
"
these
are
official
secrets
,
ma'am
;
not
to
be
spoken
of
;
except
,
as
I
may
say
,
among
the
porochial
officers
,
such
as
ourselves
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
port
wine
,
ma'am
,
that
the
board
ordered
for
the
infirmary
;
real
,
fresh
,
genuine
port
wine
;
only
out
of
the
cask
this
forenoon
;
clear
as
a
bell
,
and
no
sediment
!
"
   
<EOS>
Having
held
the
first
bottle
up
to
the
light
,
and
shaken
it
well
to
test
its
excellence
,
Mr
Bumble
placed
them
both
on
top
of
a
chest
of
drawers
;
folded
the
handkerchief
in
which
they
had
been
wrapped
;
put
it
carefully
in
his
pocket
;
and
took
up
his
hat
,
as
if
to
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
have
a
very
cold
walk
,
Mr
Bumble
,
"
said
the
matron
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
blows
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
Mr
Bumble
,
turning
up
his
coat
-
collar
,
"
enough
to
cut
one
's
ears
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
matron
looked
,
from
the
little
kettle
,
to
the
beadle
,
who
was
moving
towards
the
door
;
and
as
the
beadle
coughed
,
preparatory
to
bidding
her
good
-
night
,
bashfully
inquired
whether
---
whether
he
would
n't
take
a
cup
of
tea
?
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
instantaneously
turned
back
his
collar
again
;
laid
his
hat
and
stick
upon
a
chair
;
and
drew
another
chair
up
to
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
slowly
seated
himself
,
he
looked
at
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
She
fixed
her
eyes
upon
the
little
teapot
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
coughed
again
,
and
slightly
smiled
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Corney
rose
to
get
another
cup
and
saucer
from
the
closet
.
<EOS>
As
she
sat
down
,
her
eyes
once
again
encountered
those
of
the
gallant
beadle
;
she
coloured
,
and
applied
herself
to
the
task
of
making
his
tea
.
 
<EOS>
Again
Mr
Bumble
coughed
---
<EOS>
louder
this
time
than
he
had
coughed
yet
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sweet
?
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
matron
,
taking
up
the
sugar
-
basin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
sweet
,
indeed
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
Mr
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
He
fixed
his
eyes
on
Mrs
Corney
as
he
said
this
;
and
if
ever
a
beadle
looked
tender
,
Mr
Bumble
was
that
beadle
at
that
moment
.
   
<EOS>
The
tea
was
made
,
and
handed
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
,
having
spread
a
handkerchief
over
his
knees
to
prevent
the
crumbs
from
sullying
the
splendour
of
his
shorts
,
began
to
eat
and
drink
;
varying
these
amusements
,
occasionally
,
by
fetching
a
deep
sigh
;
which
,
however
,
had
no
injurious
effect
upon
his
appetite
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
rather
seemed
to
facilitate
his
operations
in
the
tea
and
toast
department
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
cat
,
ma'am
,
I
see
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
glancing
at
one
who
,
in
the
centre
of
her
family
,
was
basking
before
the
fire
;
"
and
kittens
too
<EOS>
,
I
declare
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
fond
of
them
,
Mr
Bumble
,
you
ca
n't
think
,
"
replied
the
matron
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
're
SO
happy
,
<EOS>
SO
frolicsome
,
and
SO
cheerful
,
that
they
are
quite
companions
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
nice
animals
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
Mr
Bumble
,
approvingly
;
"
so
very
domestic
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
!
"
rejoined
the
matron
with
enthusiasm
;
"
so
fond
of
their
home
too
,
that
it
's
quite
a
pleasure
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Corney
,
ma'am
,
said
Mr
Bumble
,
slowly
,
and
marking
the
time
with
his
teaspoon
,
"
I
mean
to
say
this
,
ma'am
;
that
any
cat
,
or
kitten
,
that
could
live
with
you
,
ma'am
,
and
NOT
be
fond
of
its
home
,
must
be
a
ass
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr
Bumble
!
"
remonstrated
Mrs
Corney
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
of
no
use
disguising
facts
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
slowly
flourishing
the
teaspoon
with
a
kind
of
amorous
dignity
which
made
him
doubly
impressive
;
"
I
would
drown
it
myself
,
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
're
a
cruel
man
,
"
said
the
matron
vivaciously
,
as
she
held
out
her
hand
for
the
beadle
's
cup
;
"
and
a
very
hard
-
hearted
man
besides
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Hard
-
hearted
,
ma'am
?
"
said
Mr
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hard
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
resigned
his
cup
without
another
word
;
squeezed
Mrs
Corney
's
little
finger
as
she
took
it
;
and
inflicting
two
open
-
handed
slaps
upon
his
laced
waistcoat
,
gave
a
mighty
sigh
,
and
hitched
his
chair
a
very
little
morsel
farther
from
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
round
table
;
and
as
Mrs
Corney
and
Mr
Bumble
had
been
sitting
opposite
each
other
,
with
no
great
space
between
them
,
and
fronting
the
fire
,
it
will
be
seen
that
Mr
Bumble
,
in
receding
from
the
fire
,
and
still
keeping
at
the
table
,
increased
the
distance
between
himself
and
Mrs
Corney
;
which
proceeding
,
some
prudent
readers
will
doubtless
be
disposed
to
admire
,
and
to
consider
an
act
of
great
heroism
on
Mr
Bumble
's
part
:
 
he
being
in
some
sort
<EOS>
tempted
by
time
,
place
,
and
opportunity
,
to
give
utterance
to
certain
soft
nothings
,
which
however
well
they
may
become
the
lips
of
the
light
and
thoughtless
,
do
seem
immeasurably
beneath
the
dignity
of
judges
of
the
land
,
members
of
parliament
,
ministers
of
state
,
lord
mayors
,
and
other
great
public
functionaries
,
but
more
particularly
beneath
the
stateliness
and
gravity
of
a
beadle
:
 
who
(
as
is
well
known
)
should
be
the
sternest
and
most
inflexible
among
them
all
.
   
<EOS>
Whatever
were
Mr
Bumble
's
intentions
,
however
(
<EOS>
and
no
doubt
they
were
of
the
best
)
<EOS>
:
it
unfortunately
happened
,
as
has
been
twice
before
remarked
,
that
the
table
was
a
round
one
;
consequently
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
,
moving
his
chair
by
little
and
little
,
soon
began
to
diminish
the
distance
between
himself
and
the
matron
;
and
,
continuing
to
travel
round
the
outer
edge
of
the
circle
,
brought
his
chair
,
in
time
,
close
to
that
in
which
the
matron
was
seated
.
   
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
two
chairs
touched
;
and
when
they
did
so
,
Mr
Bumble
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
if
the
matron
had
moved
her
chair
to
the
right
,
she
would
have
been
scorched
by
the
fire
;
and
if
to
the
left
,
she
must
have
fallen
into
Mr
Bumble
's
arms
;
so
(
being
a
discreet
matron
,
and
no
doubt
foreseeing
these
consequences
at
a
glance
)
<EOS>
she
remained
where
she
was
,
and
handed
Mr
Bumble
another
cup
of
tea
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hard
-
hearted
,
Mrs
Corney
?
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
stirring
his
tea
,
and
looking
up
into
the
matron
's
face
;
"
are
YOU
hard
-
hearted
,
Mrs
Corney
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
exclaimed
the
matron
,
"
what
a
very
curious
question
from
a
single
man
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
you
want
to
know
for
,
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
beadle
drank
his
tea
to
the
last
drop
;
finished
a
piece
of
toast
;
whisked
the
crumbs
off
his
knees
;
wiped
his
lips
;
and
deliberately
kissed
the
matron
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Bumble
!
"
cried
that
discreet
lady
in
a
whisper
;
for
the
fright
was
so
great
,
that
she
had
quite
lost
her
voice
,
"
Mr
Bumble
,
I
shall
scream
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
made
no
reply
;
but
in
a
slow
and
dignified
manner
,
put
his
arm
round
the
matron
's
waist
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
lady
had
stated
her
intention
of
screaming
,
of
course
she
would
have
screamed
at
this
additional
boldness
,
but
that
the
exertion
was
rendered
unnecessary
by
a
hasty
knocking
at
the
door
:
 
which
was
no
sooner
heard
,
than
Mr
Bumble
darted
,
with
much
agility
,
to
the
wine
bottles
,
and
began
dusting
them
with
great
violence
:
 
while
the
matron
sharply
demanded
who
was
there
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
worthy
of
remark
,
as
a
curious
physical
instance
of
the
efficacy
of
a
sudden
surprise
in
counteracting
the
effects
of
extreme
fear
,
that
her
voice
had
quite
recovered
all
its
official
asperity
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
mistress
,
"
said
a
withered
old
female
pauper
,
hideously
ugly
:
 
putting
her
head
in
at
the
door
,
"
Old
Sally
is
a
-
going
fast
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
what
's
that
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
angrily
demanded
the
matron
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
keep
her
alive
,
can
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
mistress
,
"
replied
the
old
woman
,
"
nobody
can
;
she
's
far
beyond
the
reach
of
help
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
seen
a
many
people
die
;
<EOS>
little
babes
and
great
strong
men
;
and
I
know
when
death
's
a
-
coming
,
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
's
troubled
in
her
mind
:
<EOS>
and
when
the
fits
are
not
on
her
,
---
and
that
's
not
often
,
for
she
is
dying
very
hard
,
---
she
says
she
has
got
something
to
tell
,
which
you
must
hear
.
 
<EOS>
She
'll
never
die
quiet
till
you
come
,
mistress
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
intelligence
,
the
worthy
Mrs
Corney
muttered
a
variety
of
invectives
against
old
women
who
could
n't
even
die
without
purposely
annoying
their
betters
;
and
,
muffling
herself
in
a
thick
shawl
which
she
hastily
caught
up
,
briefly
requested
Mr
Bumble
to
stay
till
she
came
back
,
lest
anything
particular
should
occur
.
 
<EOS>
Bidding
the
messenger
walk
fast
,
and
not
be
all
night
hobbling
up
the
stairs
,
she
followed
her
from
the
room
with
a
very
ill
grace
,
scolding
all
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
's
conduct
on
being
left
to
himself
,
was
rather
inexplicable
.
 
<EOS>
He
opened
the
closet
,
counted
the
teaspoons
,
weighed
the
sugar
-
tongs
,
closely
inspected
a
silver
milk
-
pot
to
ascertain
that
it
was
of
the
genuine
metal
,
and
,
having
satisfied
his
curiosity
on
these
points
,
put
on
his
cocked
hat
corner
-
wise
,
and
danced
with
much
gravity
four
distinct
times
round
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
Having
gone
through
this
very
extraordinary
performance
,
he
took
off
the
cocked
hat
again
,
and
,
spreading
himself
before
the
fire
with
his
back
towards
it
,
seemed
to
be
mentally
engaged
in
taking
an
exact
inventory
of
the
furniture
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
24
.
<EOS>
Treats
on
a
very
poor
subject
.
 
<EOS>
But
is
a
short
one
,
and
may
be
found
of
importance
in
this
history
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
no
unfit
messanger
of
death
,
who
had
disturbed
the
quiet
of
the
matron
's
room
.
 
<EOS>
Her
body
was
bent
by
age
;
her
limbs
trembled
with
palsy
;
her
face
,
distorted
into
a
mumbling
leer
,
resembled
more
the
grotesque
shaping
of
some
wild
pencil
,
than
the
work
of
Nature
's
hand
.
   
<EOS>
Alas
!
 
<EOS>
How
few
of
Nature
's
faces
are
left
alone
to
gladden
us
with
their
beauty
!
 
<EOS>
The
cares
,
and
sorrows
,
and
hungerings
,
of
the
world
,
change
them
as
they
change
hearts
;
and
it
is
only
when
those
passions
sleep
,
and
have
lost
their
hold
for
ever
,
that
the
troubled
clouds
pass
off
,
and
leave
Heaven
's
surface
clear
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
common
thing
for
the
countenances
of
the
dead
,
even
in
that
fixed
and
rigid
state
,
to
subside
into
the
long
-
forgotten
expression
of
sleeping
infancy
,
and
settle
into
the
very
look
of
early
life
;
so
calm
,
so
peaceful
,
do
they
grow
again
,
that
those
who
knew
them
in
their
happy
childhood
,
kneel
by
the
coffin
's
side
in
awe
,
and
see
the
Angel
even
upon
earth
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
crone
tottered
alone
the
passages
,
and
up
the
stairs
,
muttering
some
indistinct
answers
to
the
chidings
of
her
companion
;
being
at
length
compelled
to
pause
for
breath
,
she
gave
the
light
into
her
hand
,
and
remained
behind
to
follow
as
she
might
:
while
the
more
nimble
superior
made
her
way
to
the
room
where
the
sick
woman
lay
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
bare
garret
-
room
,
with
a
dim
light
burning
at
the
farther
end
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
another
old
woman
watching
by
the
bed
;
the
parish
apothecary
's
apprentice
was
standing
by
the
fire
,
making
a
toothpick
out
of
a
quill
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Cold
night
,
Mrs
Corney
,
"
said
this
young
gentleman
,
as
the
matron
entered
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
cold
,
indeed
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
mistress
,
in
her
most
civil
tones
,
and
dropping
a
curtsey
as
she
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
should
get
better
coals
out
of
your
contractors
,
"
said
the
apothecary
's
deputy
,
breaking
a
lump
on
the
top
of
the
fire
with
the
rusty
poker
;
"
these
are
not
at
all
the
sort
of
thing
for
a
cold
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
're
the
board
's
choosing
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
matron
.
<EOS>
"
The
least
they
could
do
,
would
be
to
keep
us
pretty
warm
:
 
for
our
places
are
hard
enough
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
conversation
was
here
interrupted
by
a
moan
from
the
sick
woman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
the
young
mag
,
turning
his
face
towards
the
bed
,
as
if
he
had
previously
quite
forgotten
the
patient
,
"
it
's
all
U*P
there
,
Mrs
Corney
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
is
it
,
sir
?
"
asked
the
matron
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
she
lasts
a
couple
of
hours
,
I
shall
be
surprised
.
"
said
the
apothecary
's
apprentice
,
intent
upon
the
toothpick
's
point
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
break
-
up
of
the
system
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
Is
she
dozing
,
old
lady
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
attendant
stooped
over
the
bed
,
to
ascertain
;
and
nodded
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
perhaps
she
'll
go
off
in
that
way
,
if
you
do
n't
make
a
row
,
"
said
the
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Put
the
light
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
She
wo
n't
see
it
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
attendant
did
as
she
was
told
:
 
shaking
her
head
meanwhile
,
to
intimate
that
the
woman
would
not
die
so
easily
;
having
done
so
,
she
resumed
her
seat
by
the
side
of
the
other
nurse
,
who
had
by
this
time
returned
.
 
<EOS>
The
mistress
,
with
an
expression
of
impatience
,
wrapped
herself
in
her
shawl
,
and
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
   
<EOS>
The
apothecary
's
apprentice
,
having
completed
the
manufacture
of
the
toothpick
,
planted
himself
in
front
of
the
fire
and
made
good
use
of
it
for
ten
minutes
or
so
:
 
when
apparently
growing
rather
dull
,
he
wished
Mrs
Corney
joy
of
her
job
,
and
took
himself
off
on
tiptoe
.
   
<EOS>
When
they
had
sat
in
silence
for
some
time
,
the
two
old
women
rose
from
the
bed
,
and
crouching
over
the
fire
,
held
out
their
withered
hands
to
catch
the
heat
.
 
<EOS>
The
flame
threw
a
ghastly
light
on
their
shrivelled
faces
,
and
made
their
ugliness
appear
terrible
,
as
,
in
this
position
,
they
began
to
converse
in
a
low
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
she
say
any
more
,
Anny
dear
,
while
I
was
gone
?
"
inquired
the
messenger
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
word
,
"
replied
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
plucked
and
tore
at
her
arms
for
a
little
time
;
but
I
held
her
hands
,
and
she
soon
dropped
off
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
n't
much
strength
in
her
,
so
I
easily
kept
her
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
I
ai
n't
so
weak
for
an
old
woman
,
although
I
am
on
parish
allowance
;
no
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
she
drink
the
hot
wine
the
doctor
said
she
was
to
have
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
first
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tried
to
get
it
down
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
her
teeth
were
tight
set
,
and
she
clenched
the
mug
so
hard
that
it
was
as
much
as
I
could
do
to
get
it
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
drank
it
;
and
it
did
me
good
!
"
   
<EOS>
Looking
cautiously
round
,
to
ascertain
that
they
were
not
overheard
,
the
two
hags
cowered
nearer
to
the
fire
,
and
chuckled
heartily
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
mind
the
time
,
"
said
the
first
speaker
,
"
when
she
would
have
done
the
same
,
and
made
rare
fun
of
it
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
that
she
would
,
"
rejoined
the
other
;
"
she
had
a
merry
heart
.
   
<EOS>
A
many
,
many
,
beautiful
corpses
she
laid
out
,
as
nice
and
neat
as
waxwork
.
 
<EOS>
My
old
eyes
have
seen
them
---
ay
,
and
those
old
hands
touched
them
too
;
for
I
have
helped
her
,
scores
of
times
.
"
   
<EOS>
Stretching
forth
her
trembling
fingers
as
she
spoke
,
the
old
creature
shook
them
exultingly
before
her
face
,
and
fumbling
in
her
pocket
,
brought
out
an
old
time
-
discoloured
tin
snuff
-
box
,
from
which
she
shook
a
few
grains
into
the
outstretched
palm
of
her
companion
,
and
a
few
more
into
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
While
they
were
thus
employed
,
the
matron
,
who
had
been
impatiently
watching
until
the
dying
woman
should
awaken
from
her
stupor
,
joined
them
by
the
fire
,
and
sharply
asked
how
long
she
was
to
wait
?
   
<EOS>
"
Not
long
,
mistress
,
"
replied
the
second
woman
,
looking
up
into
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
none
of
us
long
to
wait
for
Death
.
 
<EOS>
Patience
,
patience
!
 
<EOS>
He
'll
be
here
soon
enough
for
us
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
,
you
doting
idiot
!
"
said
the
matron
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
You
,
Martha
,
tell
me
;
has
she
been
in
this
way
before
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Often
,
"
answered
the
first
woman
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
will
never
be
again
,
"
added
the
second
one
;
"
that
is
,
she
'll
never
wake
again
but
once
---
and
mind
,
mistress
,
that
wo
n't
be
for
long
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Long
or
short
,
"
said
the
matron
,
snappishly
,
"
she
wo
n't
find
me
here
when
she
does
wake
;
take
care
,
both
of
you
,
how
you
worry
me
again
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
no
part
of
my
duty
to
see
all
the
old
women
in
the
house
die
,
and
I
wo
n't
---
that
's
more
.
<EOS>
Mind
that
,
you
impudent
old
harridans
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
make
a
fool
of
me
again
,
I
'll
soon
cure
you
,
I
warrant
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
bouncing
away
,
when
a
cry
from
the
two
women
,
who
had
turned
towards
the
bed
,
caused
her
to
look
round
.
 
<EOS>
The
patient
had
raised
herself
upright
,
and
was
stretching
her
arms
towards
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
in
a
hollow
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
hush
!
"
said
one
of
the
women
,
stooping
over
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lie
down
,
lie
down
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
never
lie
down
again
alive
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
woman
,
struggling
.
<EOS>
"
I
WILL
tell
her
!
 
<EOS>
Come
here
!
 
<EOS>
Nearer
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
whisper
in
your
ear
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
clutched
the
matron
by
the
arm
,
and
forcing
her
into
a
chair
by
the
bedside
,
was
about
to
speak
,
<EOS>
when
looking
round
,
she
caught
sight
of
the
two
old
women
bending
forward
in
the
attitude
of
eager
listeners
.
   
<EOS>
"
Turn
them
away
,
"
said
the
woman
,
drowsily
;
"
make
haste
!
<EOS>
make
haste
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
two
old
crones
,
chiming
in
together
,
began
pouring
out
many
piteous
lamentations
that
the
poor
dear
was
too
far
gone
to
know
her
best
friends
;
and
were
uttering
sundry
protestations
that
they
would
never
leave
her
,
when
the
superior
pushed
them
from
the
room
,
closed
the
door
,
and
returned
to
the
bedside
.
 
<EOS>
On
being
excluded
,
the
old
ladies
changed
their
tone
,
and
cried
through
the
keyhole
that
old
Sally
was
drunk
;
which
,
indeed
,
was
not
unlikely
;
since
,
in
addition
to
a
moderate
dose
of
opium
prescribed
by
the
apothecary
,
she
was
labouring
under
the
effects
of
a
final
taste
of
gin
-
and
-
water
which
had
been
privily
administered
,
in
the
openness
of
their
hearts
,
by
the
worthy
old
ladies
themselves
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
listen
to
me
,
"
said
the
dying
woman
aloud
,
as
if
making
a
great
effort
to
revive
one
latent
spark
of
energy
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
this
very
room
---
in
this
very
bed
---
I
once
nursed
a
pretty
young
creetur
'
,
that
was
brought
into
the
house
with
her
feet
cut
and
bruised
with
walking
,
and
all
soiled
with
dust
and
blood
.
 
<EOS>
She
gave
birth
to
a
boy
,
and
died
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
think
---
<EOS>
what
was
the
year
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
the
year
,
"
said
the
impatient
auditor
;
"
what
about
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
murmured
the
sick
woman
,
relapsing
into
her
former
drowsy
state
,
"
what
about
her
?
<EOS>
---
what
about
---
<EOS>
I
know
!
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
jumping
fiercely
up
:
her
face
flushed
,
and
her
eyes
starting
from
her
head
---
"
I
robbed
her
,
so
I
did
!
 
<EOS>
She
was
n't
cold
---
I
tell
you
she
was
n't
cold
,
when
I
stole
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stole
what
,
for
God
's
sake
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
matron
,
with
a
gesture
as
if
she
would
call
for
help
.
   
<EOS>
"
IT
!
"
replied
the
woman
,
laying
her
hand
over
the
other
's
mouth
.
<EOS>
"
The
only
thing
she
had
.
 
<EOS>
She
wanted
clothes
to
keep
her
warm
,
and
food
to
eat
;
but
she
had
kept
it
safe
,
and
had
it
in
her
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
gold
,
I
tell
you
!
 
<EOS>
Rich
gold
,
that
might
have
saved
her
life
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Gold
!
"
echoed
the
matron
,
bending
eagerly
over
the
woman
as
she
fell
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
go
on
---
yest
---
<EOS>
what
of
it

<EOS>
Who
was
the
mother
?
   
<EOS>
When
was
it

"
   
<EOS>
"
She
charge
me
to
keep
it
safe
,
"
replied
the
woman
with
a
groan
,
"
and
trusted
me
as
the
only
woman
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
stole
it
in
my
heart
when
she
first
showed
it
me
hanging
round
her
neck
;
and
the
child
's
death
,
perhaps
,
is
on
me
besides
!
 
<EOS>
They
would
have
treated
him
better
,
if
they
had
known
it
all
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Known
what
?
"
asked
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
boy
grew
so
like
his
mother
,
"
said
the
woman
,
rambling
on
,
and
not
heeding
the
question
,
"
that
I
could
never
forget
it
when
I
saw
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
girl
!
<EOS>
poor
girl
!
 
<EOS>
She
was
so
young

too

<EOS>
Such
a
gentle

<EOS>
Wait

there
's
more
to
tell

<EOS>
I
have
not
told
you
all
,
have
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No

no
,
"
replied
the
matron
,
inclining
her
head
to
catch
the
words
,
as
they
came
more
faintly
from
the
dying
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
quick
,
or
it
may
be
too
late
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
mother
,
"
said
the
woman
,
making
a
more
violent
effort
than
before
;
"
the
mother
,
when
the
pains
of
death
first
came
upon
her
,
whispered
in
my
ear
that
if
her
baby
was
born
alive
,
and
thrived
,
the
day
might
come
when
it
would
not
feel
so
much
disgraced
to
hear
its
poor
young
mother
named
.
"
<EOS>
And
oh
,
kind
Heaven
!
"
she
said
,
folding
her
thin
hands
together
,
"
whether
it
be
boy
or
girl
,
raise
up
some
friends
for
it
in
this
troubled
world
,
and
take
pity
upon
a
lonely
desolate
child
,
abandoned
to
its
mercy
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
boy
's
name
?
"
demanded
the
matron
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
CALLED
him
Oliver
,
"
replied
the
woman
,
feebly
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
gold
I
stole
was
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
---
what
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
bending
eagerly
over
the
woman
to
hear
her
reply
;
but
drew
back
,
instinctively
,
as
she
once
again
rose
,
slowly
and
stiffly
,
into
a
sitting
posture
;
then
,
clutching
the
coverlid
with
both
hands
,
muttered
some
indistinct
sounds
in
her
throat
,
and
fell
lifeless
on
the
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stone
dead
!
"
<EOS>
said
one
of
the
old
women
,
hurrying
in
as
soon
as
the
door
was
opened
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
nothing
to
tell
,
after
all
,
"
rejoined
the
matron
,
walking
carelessly
away
.
   
<EOS>
The
two
crones
,
to
all
appearance
,
too
busily
occupied
in
the
preparations
for
their
dreadful
duties
to
make
any
reply
,
were
left
alone
,
hovering
about
the
body

Chapter
25
.
<EOS>
Wherein
this
history
reverts
to
Mr
Fagin
and
company
.
 
<EOS>
While
these
things
were
passing
in
the
country
workhouse
,
Mr
Fagin
sat
in
the
old
den
---
the
same
from
which
Oliver
had
been
removed
by
the
girl
---
brooding
over
a
dull
,
smoky
fire
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
a
pair
of
bellows
upon
his
knee
,
with
which
he
had
apparently
been
endeavouring
to
rouse
it
into
more
cheerful
action
;
but
he
had
fallen
into
deep
thought
;
and
with
his
arms
folded
on
them
,
and
his
chin
resting
on
his
thumbs
,
fixed
his
eyes
,
abstractedly
,
on
the
rusty
bars
.
   
<EOS>
At
a
table
behind
him
sat
the
Artful
Dodger
,
Master
Charles
Bates
,
and
Mr
Chitling
:
<EOS>
all
intent
upon
a
game
of
whist
;
the
Artful
taking
dummy
against
Master
Bates
and
Mr
Chitling
.
 
<EOS>
The
countenance
of
the
first
-
named
gentleman
,
peculiarly
intelligent
at
all
times
,
acquired
great
additional
interest
from
his
close
observance
of
the
game
,
and
his
attentive
perusal
of
Mr
Chitling
's
hand
;
upon
which
,
from
time
to
time
,
as
occasion
served
,
he
bestowed
a
variety
of
earnest
glances
:
wisely
regulating
his
own
play
by
the
result
of
his
observations
upon
his
neighbour
's
cards
.
 
<EOS>
It
being
a
cold
night
,
the
Dodger
wore
his
hat
,
as
,
indeed
,
was
often
his
custom
within
doors
.
 
<EOS>
He
also
sustained
a
clay
pipe
between
his
teeth
,
which
he
only
removed
for
a
brief
space
when
he
deemed
it
necessary
to
apply
for
refreshment
to
a
quart
pot
upon
the
table
,
which
stood
ready
filled
with
gin
-
and
-
water
for
the
accommodation
of
the
company
.
   
<EOS>
Master
Bates
was
also
attentive
to
the
play
;
but
being
of
a
more
excitable
nature
than
his
accomplished
friend
,
it
was
observable
that
he
more
frequently
applied
himself
to
the
gin
-
and
-
water
,
and
moreover
indulged
in
many
jests
and
irrelevant
remarks
,
all
highly
unbecoming
a
scientific
rubber
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
Artful
,
presuming
upon
their
close
attachment
,
more
than
once
took
occasion
to
reason
gravely
with
his
companion
upon
these
improprieties
;
all
of
which
remonstrances
,
Master
Bates
received
in
extremely
good
part
;
merely
requesting
his
friend
to
be
"
blowed
,
"
or
to
insert
his
head
in
a
sack
,
or
replying
with
some
other
neatly
-
turned
witticism
of
a
similar
kind
,
the
happy
application
of
which
,
excited
considerable
admiration
in
the
mind
of
Mr
Chitling
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
remarkable
that
the
latter
gentleman
and
his
partner
invariably
lost
;
and
that
the
circumstance
,
so
far
from
angering
Master
Bates
,
appeared
to
afford
him
the
highest
amusement
,
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
he
laughed
most
uproariously
at
the
end
of
every
deal
,
and
protested
that
he
had
never
seen
such
a
jolly
game
in
all
his
born
days
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
two
doubles
and
the
rub
,
"
said
Mr
Chitling
,
with
a
very
long
face
,
as
he
drew
half
-
a
-
crown
from
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
such
a
feller
as
you
,
Jack
;
you
win
everything
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
we
've
good
cards
,
Charley
and
I
ca
n't
make
nothing
of
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
Either
the
master
or
the
manner
of
this
remark
,
which
was
made
very
ruefully
,
delighted
Charley
Bates
so
much
,
that
his
consequent
shout
of
laughter
roused
the
Jew
from
his
reverie
,
and
induced
him
to
inquire
what
was
the
matter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Matter
,
Fagin
!
"
cried
Charley
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
had
watched
the
play
.
 
<EOS>
Tommy
Chitling
has
n't
won
a
point
;
and
I
went
partners
with
him
against
the
Artfull
and
dumb
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
!
"
said
the
Jew
,
with
a
grin
,
which
sufficiently
demonstrated
that
he
was
at
no
loss
to
understand
the
reason
.
<EOS>
"
Try
'em
again
,
Tom
;
try
'em
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
more
of
it
for
me
,
thank
'
ee
,
Fagin
,
"
replied
Mr
Chitling
;
"
I
've
had
enough
.
 
<EOS>
That
'
ere
Dodger
has
such
a
run
of
luck
that
there
's
no
standing
again
'
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
"
replied
the
Jew
,
"
you
must
get
up
very
early
in
the
morning
,
to
win
against
the
Dodger
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Morning
!
"
said
Charley
Bates
;
"
you
must
put
your
boots
on
over
-
night
,
and
have
a
telescope
at
each
eye
,
and
a
opera
-
glass
between
your
shoulders
,
if
you
want
to
come
over
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dawkins
received
these
handsome
compliments
with
much
philosophy
,
and
offered
to
cut
any
gentleman
in
company
,
for
the
first
picture
-
card
,
at
a
shilling
at
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
accepting
the
challenge
,
and
his
pipe
being
by
this
time
smoked
out
,
he
proceeded
to
amuse
himself
by
sketching
a
ground
-
plan
of
Newgate
on
the
table
with
the
piece
of
chalk
which
had
served
him
in
lieu
of
counters
;
whistling
,
meantime
,
with
peculiar
shrillness
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
precious
dull
you
are
,
Tommy
!
"
said
the
Dodger
,
stopping
short
when
there
had
been
a
long
silence
;
and
addressing
Mr
Chitling
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
he
's
thinking
of
,
Fagin
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
should
I
know
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
replied
the
Jew
,
looking
round
as
he
plied
the
bellows
.
 
<EOS>
"
About
his
losses
,
maybe
;
or
the
little
retirement
in
the
country
that
he
's
just
left
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Is
that
it
,
my
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
"
replied
the
Dodger
,
stopping
the
subject
of
discourse
as
Mr
Chitling
was
about
to
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
YOU
say
,
Charley
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
\
<EOS>
I
\
<EOS>
should
say
,
"
replied
Master
Bates
,
with
a
grin
,
"
that
he
was
uncommon
sweet
upon
Betsy
.
 
<EOS>
See
how
he
's
a
-
blushing
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
eye
!
<EOS>
here
's
a
merry
-
go
-
rounder
!
 
<EOS>
Tommy
Chitling
's
in
love
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Fagin
,
Fagin
!
<EOS>
what
a
spree
!
"
   
<EOS>
Thoroughly
overpowered
with
the
notion
of
Mr
Chitling
being
the
victim
of
the
tender
passion
,
Master
Bates
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
with
such
violence
,
that
he
lost
his
balance
,
and
pitched
over
upon
the
floor
;
where
(
the
accident
abating
nothing
of
his
merriment
)
<EOS>
he
lay
at
full
length
until
his
laugh
was
over
,
when
he
resumed
his
former
position
,
and
began
another
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
him
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
winking
at
Mr
Dawkins
,
and
giving
Master
Bates
a
reproving
tap
with
the
nozzle
of
the
bellows
.
 
<EOS>
"
Betsy
's
a
fine
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Stick
up
to
her
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
Stick
up
to
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
I
mean
to
say
,
Fagin
,
"
replied
Mr
Chitling
,
very
red
in
the
face
,
"
is
,
that
that
is
n't
anything
to
anybody
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
more
it
is
,
"
replied
the
Jew
;
"
Charley
will
talk
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
mind
him
,
my
dear
;
do
n't
mind
him
.
 
<EOS>
Betsy
's
a
fine
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Do
as
she
bids
you
,
Tom
,
and
you
will
make
your
fortune
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
I
DO
do
as
she
bids
me
,
"
replied
Mr
Chitling
;
"
I
should
n't
have
been
milled
,
if
it
had
n't
been
for
her
advice
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
turned
out
a
good
job
for
you
;
did
n't
it
,
Fagin
!
 
<EOS>
And
what
's
six
weeks
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
It
must
come
,
some
time
or
another
,
and
why
not
in
the
winter
time
when
you
do
n't
want
to
go
out
a
-
walking
so
much
;
eh
,
Fagin
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
to
be
sure
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
the
Jew
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
mind
it
again
,
Tom
,
would
you
,
"
asked
the
Dodger
,
winking
upon
Charley
and
the
Jew
,
"
if
Bet
was
all
right
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
say
that
I
should
n't
,
"
replied
Tom
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
There
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Who
'll
say
as
much
as
that
,
I
should
like
to
know
;
eh
,
Fagin
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nobody
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
the
Jew
;
"
not
a
soul
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
one
of
'em
that
would
do
it
besides
you
;
not
one
of
'em
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
might
have
got
clear
off
,
if
I
'd
split
upon
her
;
might
n't
I
,
Fagin
?
"
<EOS>
angrily
pursued
the
poor
half
-
witted
dupe
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
word
from
me
would
have
done
it
;
would
n't
it
,
Fagin
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
it
would
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
the
Jew
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
did
n't
blab
it
;
did
I
,
Fagin
?
"
<EOS>
demanded
Tom
,
pouring
question
upon
question
with
great
volubility
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
to
be
sure
,
"
replied
the
Jew
;
"
you
were
too
stout
-
hearted
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
A
deal
too
stout
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
was
,
"
rejoined
Tom
,
looking
round
;
"
and
if
I
was
,
what
's
to
laugh
at
,
in
that
;
eh
,
Fagin
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
,
perceiving
that
Mr
Chitling
was
considerably
roused
,
hastened
to
assure
him
that
nobody
was
laughing
;
and
to
prove
the
gravity
of
the
company
,
appealed
to
Master
Bates
,
the
principal
offender
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
unfortunately
,
Charley
,
in
opening
his
mouth
to
reply
that
he
was
never
more
serious
in
his
life
,
was
unable
to
prevent
the
escape
of
such
a
violent
roar
,
that
the
abused
Mr
Chitling
,
without
any
preliminary
ceremonies
,
rushed
across
the
room
and
aimed
a
blow
at
the
offender
;
who
,
being
skilful
in
evading
pursuit
,
ducked
to
avoid
it
,
and
chose
his
time
<EOS>
so
well
that
it
lighted
on
the
chest
of
the
merry
old
gentleman
,
and
caused
him
to
stagger
to
the
wall
,
where
he
stood
panting
for
breath
,
while
Mr
Chitling
looked
on
in
intense
dismay
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
"
cried
the
Dodger
at
this
moment
,
"
I
heard
the
tinkler
.
<EOS>
"
Catching
up
the
light
,
he
crept
softly
upstairs
.
   
<EOS>
The
bell
was
rung
again
,
with
some
impatience
,
while
the
party
were
in
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
short
pause
,
the
Dodger
reappeared
,
and
whispered
Fagin
mysteriously
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
cried
the
Jew
,
"
alone
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
Dodger
nodded
in
the
affirmative
,
and
,
shading
the
flame
of
the
candle
with
his
hand
,
gave
Charley
Bates
a
private
intimation
,
in
dumb
show
,
that
he
had
better
not
be
funny
just
then
.
 
<EOS>
Having
performed
this
friendly
office
,
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
Jew
's
face
,
and
awaited
his
directions
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
bit
his
yellow
fingers
,
and
meditated
for
some
seconds
;
his
face
working
with
agitation
the
while
,
as
if
he
dreaded
something
,
and
feared
to
know
the
worst
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
raised
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
   
<EOS>
The
Dodger
pointed
to
the
floor
above
,
and
made
a
gesture
,
as
if
to
leave
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
answering
the
mute
inquiry
;
"
bring
him
down
.
   
<EOS>
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
Quiet
,
Charley
!
 
<EOS>
Gently
,
Tom
!
 
<EOS>
Scarce
,
scarce
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
brief
direction
to
Charley
Bates
,
and
his
recent
antagonist
,
was
softly
and
immediately
obeyed
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
sound
of
their
whereabout
,
when
the
Dodger
descended
the
stairs
,
bearing
the
light
in
his
hand
,
and
followed
by
a
man
in
a
coarse
smock
-
frock
;
who
,
after
casting
a
hurried
glance
round
the
room
,
pulled
off
a
large
wrapper
which
had
concealed
the
lower
portion
of
his
face
,
and
disclosed
:
all
haggard
,
unwashed
,
and
unshorn
:
the
features
of
flash
Toby
Crackit
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
,
Faguey
?
"
said
this
worthy
,
nodding
to
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pop
that
shawl
away
in
my
castor
,
Dodger
,
so
that
I
may
know
where
to
find
it
when
I
cut
;
that
's
the
time
of
day
!
 
<EOS>
You
'll
be
a
fine
young
cracksman
<EOS>
afore
the
old
file
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
he
pulled
up
the
smock
-
frock
;
and
,
winding
it
round
his
middle
,
drew
a
chair
to
the
fire
,
and
placed
his
feet
upon
the
hob
.
   
<EOS>
"
See
there
,
Faguey
,
"
he
said
,
pointing
disconsolately
to
his
top
boots
;
"
not
a
drop
of
Day
and
Martin
since
you
know
when
;
not
a
bubble
of
blacking
,
by
Jove
!
  
<EOS>
But
do
n't
look
at
me
in
that
way
,
man
.
 
<EOS>
All
in
good
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
talk
about
business
till
I
've
eat
and
drank
;
so
produce
the
sustainance
,
and
let
's
have
a
quiet
fill
-
out
for
the
first
time
these
three
days
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
motioned
to
the
Dodger
to
place
what
eatables
there
were
,
upon
the
table
;
and
,
seating
himself
opposite
the
housebreaker
,
waited
his
leisure
.
   
<EOS>
To
judge
from
appearances
,
Toby
was
by
no
means
in
a
hurry
to
open
the
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
the
Jew
contented
himself
with
patiently
watching
his
countenance
,
as
if
to
gain
from
its
expression
some
clue
to
the
intelligence
he
brought
;
but
in
vain
.
   
<EOS>
He
looked
tired
and
worn
,
but
there
was
the
same
complacent
repose
upon
his
features
that
they
always
wore
:
 
and
through
dirt
,
and
beard
,
and
whisker
,
there
still
shone
,
unimpaired
,
the
self
-
satisfied
smirk
of
flash
Toby
Crackit
.
<EOS>
Then
the
Jew
,
in
an
agony
of
impatience
,
watched
every
morsel
he
put
into
his
mouth
;
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
,
meanwhile
,
in
irrepressible
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
all
of
no
use
.
 
<EOS>
Toby
continued
to
eat
with
the
utmost
outward
indifference
,
until
he
could
eat
no
more
;
then
,
ordering
the
Dodger
out
,
he
closed
the
door
,
mixed
a
glass
of
spirits
and
water
,
and
composed
himself
for
talking
.
   
<EOS>
"
First
and
foremost
,
Faguey
,
"
said
Toby
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
!
"
interposed
the
Jew
,
drawing
up
his
chair
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crackit
stopped
to
take
a
draught
of
spirits
and
water
,
and
to
declare
that
the
gin
was
excellent
;
then
placing
his
feet
against
the
low
mantelpiece
,
so
as
to
bring
his
boots
to
about
the
level
of
his
eye
,
he
quietly
resumed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
First
and
foremost
,
Faguey
,
"
said
the
housebreaker
,
"
how
's
Bill
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
screamed
the
Jew
,
starting
from
his
seat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
---
"
began
Toby
,
turning
pale
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mean
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
Jew
,
stamping
furiously
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"
Where
are
they
?
 
<EOS>
Sikes
and
the
boy
!
 
<EOS>
Where
are
they
?
 
<EOS>
Where
have
they
been
?
 
<EOS>
Where
are
they
hiding
?
 
<EOS>
Why
have
they
not
been
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
crack
failed
,
"
said
Toby
faintly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
"
replied
the
Jew
,
tearing
a
newspaper
from
his
pocket
and
pointing
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
more
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
fired
and
hit
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
We
cut
over
the
fields
at
the
back
,
with
him
between
us
---
straight
as
the
crow
flies
---
through
hedge
and
ditch
.
 
<EOS>
They
gave
chase
.
 
<EOS>
Damme
!
<EOS>
the
whole
country
was
awake
,
and
the
dogs
upon
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
boy
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bill
had
him
on
his
back
,
and
scudded
like
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
We
stopped
to
take
him
between
us
;
his
head
hung
down
,
and
he
was
cold
.
<EOS>
They
were
close
upon
our
heels
;
every
man
for
himself
,
and
each
from
the
gallows
!
 
<EOS>
We
parted
company
,
and
left
the
youngster
lying
in
a
ditch
.
 
<EOS>
Alive
or
dead
,
that
's
all
I
know
about
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
stopped
to
hear
no
more
;
but
uttering
a
loud
yell
,
and
twining
his
hands
in
his
hair
,
rushed
from
the
room
,
and
from
the
house
.

Chapter
26
.
<EOS>
In
which
a
mysterious
character
appears
upon
the
scene
;
and
many
things
,
inseparable
from
this
history
,
are
done
and
performed
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
had
gained
the
street
corner
,
before
he
began
to
recover
the
effect
of
Toby
Crackit
's
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
relaxed
nothing
of
his
unusual
speed
;
but
was
still
pressing
onward
,
in
the
same
wild
and
disordered
manner
,
when
the
sudden
dashing
past
of
a
carriage
:
and
a
boisterous
cry
from
the
foot
passengers
,
who
saw
his
danger
:
 
drove
him
back
upon
the
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
Avoiding
,
as
much
as
was
possible
,
all
the
main
streets
,
and
skulking
only
through
the
by
-
ways
and
alleys
,
he
at
length
emerged
on
Snow
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
Here
he
walked
even
faster
than
before
;
nor
did
he
linger
until
he
had
again
turned
into
a
court
;
when
,
as
if
conscious
that
he
was
now
in
his
proper
element
,
he
fell
into
his
usual
shuffling
pace
,
and
seemed
to
breathe
more
freely
.
   
<EOS>
Near
to
the
spot
on
which
Snow
Hill
and
Holborn
Hill
meet
,
opens
,
upon
the
right
hand
as
you
come
out
of
the
City
,
a
narrow
and
dismal
alley
,
leading
to
Saffron
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
In
its
filthy
shops
are
exposed
for
sale
huge
bunches
of
second
-
hand
silk
handkerchiefs
,
of
all
sizes
and
patterns
;
for
here
reside
the
traders
who
purchase
them
from
pick
-
pockets
.
 
<EOS>
Hundreds
of
these
handkerchiefs
hang
dangling
from
pegs
outside
the
windows
or
flaunting
from
the
door
-
posts
;
and
the
shelves
,
within
,
are
piled
with
them
.
<EOS>
Confined
as
the
limits
of
Field
Lane
are
,
it
has
its
barber
,
its
coffee
-
shop
,
its
beer
-
shop
,
and
its
fried
-
fish
warehouse
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
commercial
colony
of
itself
:
 
the
emporium
of
petty
larceny
:
visited
at
early
morning
,
and
setting
-
in
of
dusk
,
by
silent
merchants
,
who
traffic
in
dark
back
-
parlours
,
and
who
go
as
strangely
as
they
come
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
the
clothesman
,
the
shoe
-
vamper
,
and
the
rag
-
merchant
,
display
their
goods
,
as
sign
-
boards
to
the
petty
thief
;
here
,
stores
of
old
iron
and
bones
,
and
heaps
of
mildewy
fragments
of
woollen
-
stuff
and
linen
,
rust
and
rot
in
the
grimy
cellars
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
into
this
place
that
the
Jew
turned
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
well
known
to
the
sallow
denizens
of
the
lane
;
for
such
of
them
as
were
on
the
look
-
out
to
buy
or
sell
,
nodded
,
familiarly
,
as
he
passed
along
.
<EOS>
He
replied
to
their
salutations
in
the
same
way
;
but
bestowed
no
closer
recognition
until
he
reached
the
further
end
of
the
alley
;
when
he
stopped
,
to
address
a
salesman
of
small
stature
,
who
had
squeezed
as
much
of
his
person
into
a
child
's
chair
as
the
chair
would
hold
,
and
was
smoking
a
pipe
at
his
warehouse
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
sight
of
you
,
Mr
Fagin
,
would
cure
the
hoptalymy
!
"
said
this
respectable
trader
,
in
acknowledgment
of
the
Jew
's
inquiry
after
his
health
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
neighbourhood
was
a
little
too
hot
,
Lively
,
"
said
Fagin
,
elevating
his
eyebrows
,
and
crossing
his
hands
upon
his
shoulders
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
've
heerd
that
complaint
of
it
,
once
or
twice
before
,
"
replied
the
trader
;
"
but
it
soon
cools
down
again
;
do
n't
you
find
it
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
Fagin
nodded
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
Pointing
in
the
direction
of
Saffron
Hill
,
he
inquired
whether
any
one
was
up
yonder
to
-
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
the
Cripples
?
"
inquired
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
nodded
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
,
"
pursued
the
merchant
,
reflecting
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
there
's
some
half
-
dozen
of
'em
gone
in
,
that
I
knows
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
your
friend
's
there
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sikes
is
not
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
Jew
,
with
a
disappointed
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Non
istwentus
,
as
the
lawyers
say
,
"
replied
the
little
man
,
shaking
his
head
,
and
looking
amazingly
sly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
got
anything
in
my
line
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
to
-
night
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
turning
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
up
to
the
Cripples
,
Fagin
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
little
man
,
calling
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
if
I
have
a
drop
there
with
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
as
the
Jew
,
looking
back
,
waved
his
hand
to
intimate
that
he
preferred
being
alone
;
and
,
moreover
,
as
the
little
man
could
not
very
easily
disengage
himself
from
the
chair
;
the
sign
of
the
Cripples
was
,
for
a
time
,
bereft
of
the
advantage
of
Mr
Lively
's
presence
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
time
he
had
got
upon
his
legs
,
the
Jew
had
disappeared
;
so
Mr
Lively
,
after
ineffectually
standing
on
tiptoe
,
in
the
hope
of
catching
sight
of
him
,
again
forced
himself
into
the
little
chair
,
and
,
exchanging
a
shake
of
the
head
with
a
lady
in
the
opposite
shop
,
in
which
doubt
and
mistrust
were
plainly
mingled
,
resumed
his
pipe
with
a
grave
demeanour
.
   
<EOS>
The
Three
Cripples
,
or
rather
the
Cripples
;
which
was
the
sign
by
which
the
establishment
was
familiarly
known
to
its
patrons
:
 
was
the
public
-
house
in
which
Mr
Sikes
and
his
dog
have
already
figured
.
 
<EOS>
Merely
making
a
sign
to
a
man
at
the
bar
,
Fagin
walked
straight
upstairs
,
and
opening
the
door
of
a
room
,
and
softly
insinuating
himself
into
the
chamber
,
looked
anxiously
about
:
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
,
as
if
in
search
of
some
particular
person
.
   
<EOS>
The
room
was
illuminated
by
two
gas
-
lights
;
the
glare
of
which
was
prevented
by
the
barred
shutters
,
and
closely
-
drawn
curtains
of
faded
red
,
from
being
visible
outside
.
 
<EOS>
The
ceiling
was
blackened
,
to
prevent
its
colour
from
being
injured
by
the
flaring
of
the
lamps
;
and
the
place
was
so
full
of
dense
tobacco
smoke
,
that
at
first
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
discern
anything
more
.
 
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
however
,
as
some
of
it
cleared
away
through
the
open
door
,
an
assemblage
of
heads
,
as
confused
as
the
noises
that
greeted
the
ear
,
might
be
made
out
;
and
as
the
eye
grew
more
accustomed
to
the
scene
,
the
spectator
gradually
became
aware
of
the
presence
of
a
numerous
company
,
male
and
female
<EOS>
,
crowded
round
a
long
table
:
at
the
upper
end
of
which
,
sat
a
chairman
with
a
hammer
of
office
in
his
hand
;
while
a
professional
gentleman
with
a
bluish
nose
,
and
his
face
tied
up
for
the
benefit
of
a
toothache
,
presided
at
a
jingling
piano
in
a
remote
corner
.
   
<EOS>
As
Fagin
stepped
softly
in
,
the
professional
gentleman
,
running
over
the
keys
by
way
of
prelude
,
occasioned
a
general
cry
of
order
for
a
song
;
which
having
subsided
,
a
young
lady
proceeded
to
entertain
the
company
with
a
ballad
in
four
verses
,
between
each
of
which
the
accompanyist
played
the
melody
all
through
,
as
loud
as
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
When
this
was
over
,
the
chairman
gave
a
sentiment
,
after
which
,
the
professional
gentleman
on
the
chairman
's
right
and
left
volunteered
a
duet
,
and
sang
it
,
with
great
applause
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
curious
to
observe
some
faces
which
stood
out
prominently
from
among
the
group
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
chairman
himself
,
(
the
landlord
of
the
house
,
)
a
coarse
,
rough
,
heavy
built
fellow
,
who
,
while
the
songs
were
proceeding
,
rolled
his
eyes
hither
and
thither
,
and
,
seeming
to
give
himself
up
to
joviality
,
had
an
eye
for
everything
that
was
done
,
and
an
ear
for
everything
that
was
said
---
and
sharp
ones
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
Near
him
were
the
singers
:
<EOS>
receiving
,
with
professional
indifference
,
the
compliments
of
the
company
,
and
applying
themselves
,
in
turn
,
to
a
dozen
proffered
glasses
of
spirits
and
water
,
tendered
by
their
more
boisterous
admirers
;
whose
countenances
,
expressive
of
almost
every
vice
in
almost
every
grade
,
irresistibly
attracted
the
attention
,
by
their
very
repulsiveness
.
 
<EOS>
Cunning
,
ferocity
,
and
drunkeness
in
all
its
stages
,
were
there
,
in
their
strongest
aspect
;
and
women
:
   
some
with
the
last
lingering
tinge
of
their
early
freshness
almost
fading
as
you
looked
:
 
others
with
every
mark
and
stamp
of
their
sex
utterly
beaten
out
,
and
presenting
but
one
loathsome
blank
of
profligacy
and
crime
;
some
mere
girls
,
others
but
young
women
,
and
none
past
the
prime
of
life
;
formed
the
darkest
and
saddest
portion
of
this
dreary
picture
.
   
<EOS>
Fagin
,
troubled
by
no
grave
emotions
,
looked
eagerly
from
face
to
face
while
these
proceedings
were
in
progress
;
but
apparently
without
meeting
that
of
which
he
was
in
search
.
<EOS>
Succeeding
,
at
length
,
in
catching
the
eye
of
the
man
who
occupied
the
chair
,
he
beckoned
to
him
slightly
,
and
left
the
room
,
as
quietly
as
he
had
entered
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
can
I
do
for
you
,
Mr
Fagin
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
man
,
as
he
followed
him
out
to
the
landing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
join
us
?
 
<EOS>
They
'll
be
delighted
,
every
one
of
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
shook
his
head
impatiently
,
and
said
in
a
whisper
,
"
Is
HE
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
no
news
of
Barney
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Fagin
.
   
<EOS>
"
None
,
"
replied
the
landlord
of
the
Cripples
;
for
it
was
he
.
"
<EOS>
He
wo
n't
stir
till
it
's
all
safe
.
 
<EOS>
Depend
on
it
,
they
're
on
the
scent
down
there
;
and
that
if
he
moved
,
he
'd
blow
upon
the
thing
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
all
right
enough
,
Barney
is
,
else
I
should
have
heard
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
pound
it
,
that
Barney
's
managing
properly
.
<EOS>
Let
him
alone
for
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
HE
be
here
to
-
night
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
Jew
,
laying
the
same
emphasis
on
the
pronoun
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
Monks
,
do
you
mean
?
"
inquired
the
landlord
,
hesitating
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
said
the
Jew
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certain
,
"
replied
the
man
,
drawing
a
gold
watch
from
his
fob
;
"
I
expected
him
here
before
now
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
'll
wait
ten
minutes
,
he
'll
be
---
"
   
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
hastily
;
as
though
,
however
desirous
he
might
be
to
see
the
person
in
question
,
he
was
nevertheless
relieved
by
his
absence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
I
came
here
to
see
him
;
and
that
he
must
come
to
me
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
say
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
is
not
here
,
to
-
morrow
will
be
time
enough
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
said
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
more
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
word
now
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
descending
the
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
said
the
other
,
looking
over
the
rails
,
and
speaking
in
a
hoarse
whisper
;
"
what
a
time
this
would
be
for
a
sell
!
 
<EOS>
I
've
got
Phil
Barker
here
:
<EOS>
so
drunk
,
that
a
boy
might
take
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
not
Phil
Barker
's
time
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
looking
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Phil
has
something
more
to
do
,
before
we
can
afford
to
part
with
him
;
so
go
back
to
the
company
,
my
dear
,
and
tell
them
to
lead
merry
lives
---
WHILE
THEY
LAST
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
landlord
reciprocated
the
old
man
's
laugh
;
and
returned
to
his
guests
.
 
<EOS>
The
Jew
was
no
sooner
alone
,
than
his
countenance
resumed
its
former
expression
of
anxiety
and
thought
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
brief
reflection
,
he
called
a
hack
-
cabriolet
,
and
bade
the
man
drive
towards
Bethnal
Green
.
<EOS>
He
dismissed
him
within
some
quarter
of
a
mile
of
Mr
Sikes
's
residence
,
and
performed
the
short
remainder
of
the
distance
,
on
foot
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
muttered
the
Jew
,
as
he
knocked
at
the
door
,
"
if
there
is
any
deep
play
here
,
I
shall
have
it
out
of
you
,
my
girl
,
cunning
as
you
are
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
in
her
room
,
the
woman
said
.
 
<EOS>
Fagin
crept
softly
upstairs
,
and
entered
it
without
any
previous
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
The
girl
was
alone
;
lying
with
her
head
upon
the
table
,
and
her
hair
straggling
over
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
has
been
drinking
,
"
thought
the
Jew
,
coolly
,
"
or
perhaps
she
is
only
miserable
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
turned
to
close
the
door
,
as
he
made
this
reflection
;
the
noise
thus
occasioned
,
roused
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
She
eyed
his
crafty
face
narrowly
,
as
she
inquired
to
his
recital
of
Toby
Crackit
's
story
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
was
concluded
,
she
sank
into
her
former
attitude
,
but
spoke
not
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
She
pushed
the
candle
impatiently
away
;
and
once
or
twice
as
she
feverishly
changed
her
position
,
shuffled
her
feet
upon
the
ground
;
but
this
was
all
.
   
<EOS>
During
the
silence
,
the
Jew
looked
restlessly
about
the
room
,
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
there
were
no
appearances
of
Sikes
having
covertly
returned
.
 
<EOS>
Apparently
satisfied
with
his
inspection
,
he
coughed
twice
or
thrice
,
and
made
as
many
efforts
to
open
a
conversation
;
but
the
girl
heeded
him
no
more
than
if
he
had
been
made
of
stone
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
made
another
attempt
;
and
rubbing
his
hands
together
,
said
,
in
his
most
concilitory
tone
,
   
"
<EOS>
And
where
should
you
think
Bill
was
now
,
my
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
girl
moaned
out
some
half
intelligible
reply
,
that
she
could
not
tell
;
and
seemed
,
from
the
smothered
noise
that
escaped
her
,
to
be
crying
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
the
boy
,
too
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
straining
his
eyes
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
leetle
child
!
 
<EOS>
Left
in
a
ditch
,
Nance
;
only
think
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
child
,
"
said
the
girl
,
suddenly
looking
up
,
"
is
better
where
he
is
,
than
among
us
;
and
if
no
harm
comes
to
Bill
from
it
,
I
hope
he
lies
dead
in
the
ditch
and
that
his
young
bones
may
rot
there
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
cried
the
Jew
,
in
amazement
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
I
do
,
"
returned
the
girl
,
meeting
his
gaze
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
glad
to
have
him
away
from
my
eyes
,
and
to
know
that
the
worst
is
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
to
have
him
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
sight
of
him
turns
me
against
myself
,
and
all
of
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
"
said
the
Jew
,
scornfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
drunk
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Am
I
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
girl
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
fault
of
yours
,
if
I
am
not
!
 
<EOS>
You
'd
never
have
me
anything
else
,
if
you
had
your
will
,
except
now
;
---
the
humour
does
n't
suit
you
,
does
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
rejoined
the
Jew
,
furiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
does
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Change
it
,
then
!
<EOS>
"
responded
the
girl
,
with
a
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
Change
it
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
Jew
,
exasperated
beyond
all
bounds
by
his
companion
's
unexpected
obstinacy
,
and
the
vexation
of
the
night
,
"
I
WILL
change
it
!
 
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
,
you
drab
.
 
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
,
who
with
six
words
,
can
strangle
Sikes
as
surely
as
if
I
had
his
bull
's
throat
between
my
fingers
now
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
comes
back
,
and
leaves
the
boy
behind
him
;
if
he
gets
off
free
,
and
dead
or
alive
,
fails
to
restore
him
to
me
;
murder
him
yourself
if
you
would
have
him
escape
Jack
Ketch
.
 
<EOS>
And
do
it
the
moment
he
sets
foot
in
this
room
,
or
mind
me
,
it
will
be
too
late
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
all
this
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
girl
involuntarily
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
pursued
Fagin
,
mad
with
rage
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
the
boy
's
worth
hundreds
of
pounds
to
me
,
am
I
to
lose
what
chance
threw
me
in
the
way
of
getting
safely
,
through
the
whims
of
a
drunken
gang
that
I
could
whistle
away
the
lives
of
!
 
<EOS>
And
me
bound
,
too
,
to
a
born
devil
that
only
wants
the
will
,
and
has
the
power
to
,
to
---
"
   
Panting
for
breath
,
<EOS>
the
old
man
stammered
for
a
word
;
and
in
that
instant
checked
the
torrent
of
his
wrath
,
and
changed
his
whole
demeanour
.
 
<EOS>
A
moment
before
,
his
clenched
hands
had
grasped
the
air
;
his
eyes
had
dilated
;
and
his
face
grown
livid
with
passion
;
but
now
,
he
shrunk
into
a
chair
,
and
,
cowering
together
,
trembled
with
the
apprehension
of
having
himself
disclosed
some
hidden
villainy
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
short
silence
,
he
ventured
to
look
round
at
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
He
appeared
somewhat
reassured
,
on
beholding
her
in
the
same
listless
attitude
from
which
he
had
first
roused
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nancy
,
dear
!
"
croaked
the
Jew
,
in
his
usual
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
mind
me
,
dear
?
"
   
"
Do
n't
worry
me
now
,
Fagin
!
"
replied
the
girl
,
raising
her
head
languidly
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
Bill
has
not
done
it
this
time
,
he
will
another
.
<EOS>
He
has
done
many
a
good
job
for
you
,
and
will
do
many
more
when
he
can
;
and
when
he
ca
n't
he
wo
n't
;
so
no
more
about
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Regarding
this
boy
,
my
dear
?
"
said
the
Jew
,
rubbing
the
palms
of
his
hands
nervously
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
boy
must
take
his
chance
with
the
rest
,
"
interrupted
Nancy
,
hastily
;
"
and
I
say
again
<EOS>
,
I
hope
he
is
dead
,
and
out
of
harm
's
way
,
and
out
of
yours
,
---
that
is
,
if
Bill
comes
to
no
harm
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
Toby
got
clear
off
,
Bill
's
pretty
sure
to
be
safe
;
for
Bill
's
worth
two
of
Toby
any
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
about
what
I
was
saying
,
my
dear
?
"
observed
the
Jew
,
keeping
his
glistening
eye
steadily
upon
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
must
say
it
all
over
again
,
if
it
's
anything
you
want
me
to
do
,
"
rejoined
Nancy
;
"
and
if
it
is
,
you
had
better
wait
till
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
You
put
me
up
for
a
minute
;
but
now
I
'm
stupid
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
Fagin
put
several
other
questions
:
all
with
the
same
drift
of
ascertaining
whether
the
girl
had
profited
by
his
unguarded
hints
;
but
,
she
answered
them
so
readily
,
and
was
withal
so
utterly
unmoved
by
his
searching
looks
,
that
his
original
impression
of
her
being
more
than
a
trifle
in
liquor
,
was
confirmed
.
 
<EOS>
Nancy
,
indeed
,
was
not
exempt
from
a
failing
which
was
very
common
among
the
Jew
's
female
pupils
;
and
in
which
,
in
their
tenderer
years
,
they
were
rather
encouraged
than
checked
.
<EOS>
Her
disordered
appearance
,
and
a
wholesale
perfume
of
Geneva
which
pervaded
the
apartment
,
afforded
stong
confirmatory
evidence
of
the
justice
of
the
Jew
's
supposition
;
and
when
,
after
indulging
in
the
temporary
display
of
violence
above
described
,
she
subsided
,
first
into
dullness
,
and
afterwards
into
a
compound
of
feelings
:
<EOS>
under
the
influence
of
which
she
shed
tears
one
minute
,
and
in
the
next
gave
utterance
to
various
exclamations
of
"
Never
say
die
!
"
and
divers
calculations
as
to
what
might
be
the
amount
of
the
odds
so
long
as
a
lady
or
gentleman
was
happy
,
Mr
Fagin
,
who
had
had
considerable
experience
of
such
matters
in
his
time
,
saw
,
with
great
satisfaction
,
that
she
was
very
far
gone
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
Having
eased
his
mind
by
this
discovery
;
and
having
accomplished
his
twofold
object
of
imparting
to
the
girl
what
he
had
,
that
night
,
heard
,
and
of
ascertaining
,
with
his
own
eyes
,
that
Sikes
had
not
returned
,
Mr
Fagin
again
turned
his
face
homeward
:
leaving
his
young
friend
asleep
,
with
her
head
upon
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
within
an
hour
of
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
The
weather
being
dark
,
and
piercing
cold
,
he
had
no
great
temptation
to
loiter
.
 
<EOS>
The
sharp
wind
that
scoured
the
streets
,
seemed
to
have
cleared
them
of
passengers
,
as
of
dust
and
mud
,
for
few
people
were
abroad
,
and
they
were
to
all
appearance
hastening
fast
home
.
<EOS>
It
blew
from
the
right
quarter
for
the
Jew
,
however
,
and
straight
before
it
he
went
:
trembling
,
and
shivering
,
as
every
fresh
gust
drove
him
rudely
on
his
way
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
reached
the
corner
of
his
own
street
,
and
was
already
fumbling
in
his
pocket
for
the
door
-
key
,
when
a
dark
figure
emerged
from
a
projecting
entrance
which
lay
in
deep
shadow
,
and
,
crossing
the
road
,
glided
up
to
him
unperceived
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fagin
!
"
whispered
a
voice
close
to
his
ear
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
Jew
,
turning
quickly
round
,
"
is
that
---
"
   
"
Yes
!
<EOS>
"
interrupted
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
lingering
here
these
two
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Where
the
devil
have
you
been
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
your
business
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
the
Jew
,
glancing
uneasily
at
his
companion
,
and
slackening
his
pace
as
he
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
your
business
all
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
of
course
!
"
said
the
stranger
,
with
a
sneer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
;
and
what
's
come
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
good
,
"
said
the
Jew
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
bad
<EOS>
,
I
hope
?
"
said
the
stranger
,
stopping
short
,
and
turning
a
startled
look
on
his
companion
.
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
shook
his
head
,
and
was
about
to
reply
,
when
the
stranger
,
interrupting
him
,
motioned
to
the
house
,
before
which
they
had
by
this
time
arrived
:
 
remarking
,
that
he
had
better
say
what
he
had
got
to
say
,
under
cover
:
 
for
his
blood
was
chilled
with
standing
about
so
long
,
and
the
wind
blew
through
him
.
   
<EOS>
Fagin
looked
as
if
he
could
have
willingly
excused
himself
from
taking
home
a
visitor
at
that
unseasonable
hour
;
and
,
indeed
,
muttered
something
about
having
no
fire
;
but
his
companion
repeating
his
request
in
a
peremptory
manner
,
he
unlocked
the
door
,
and
requested
him
to
close
it
softly
,
while
he
got
a
light
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
as
dark
as
the
grave
,
"
said
the
man
,
groping
forward
a
few
steps
.
 
<EOS>
"
Make
haste
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shut
the
door
,
"
whispered
Fagin
from
the
end
of
the
passage
.
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
it
closed
with
a
loud
noise
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
was
n't
my
doing
,
"
said
the
other
man
,
feeling
his
way
.
<EOS>
"
The
wind
blew
it
to
,
or
it
shut
of
its
own
accord
:
one
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
Look
sharp
with
the
light
,
or
I
shall
knock
my
brains
out
against
something
in
this
confounded
hole
.
"
   
<EOS>
Fagin
stealthily
descended
the
kitchen
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
short
absence
,
he
returned
with
a
lighted
candle
,
and
the
intelligence
that
Toby
Crackit
was
asleep
in
the
back
room
below
,
and
that
the
boys
were
in
the
front
one
.
 
<EOS>
Beckoning
the
man
to
follow
him
,
he
led
the
way
upstairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
can
say
the
few
words
we
've
got
to
say
in
here
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
throwing
open
a
door
on
the
first
floor
;
"
and
as
there
are
holes
in
the
shutters
,
and
we
never
show
lights
to
our
neighbours
,
we
'll
set
the
candle
on
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
There
!
"
   
With
those
words
,
the
Jew
,
stooping
down
,
placed
the
candle
on
an
upper
flight
of
stairs
,
exactly
opposite
to
the
room
door
.
 
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
led
the
way
into
the
apartment
;
which
was
destitute
of
all
movables
save
a
broken
arm
-
chair
,
and
an
old
couch
or
sofa
without
covering
,
which
stood
behind
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
piece
of
furniture
,
the
stranger
sat
himself
with
the
air
of
a
weary
man
;
and
the
Jew
,
drawing
up
the
arm
-
chair
opposite
,
they
sat
face
to
face
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
quite
dark
;
the
door
was
partially
open
;
and
the
candle
outside
,
threw
a
feeble
reflection
on
the
opposite
wall
.
   
<EOS>
They
conversed
for
some
time
in
whispers
.
 
<EOS>
Though
nothing
of
the
conversation
was
distinguishable
beyond
a
few
disjointed
words
here
and
there
,
a
listener
might
easily
have
perceived
that
Fagin
appeared
to
be
defending
himself
against
some
remarks
of
the
stranger
;
and
that
the
latter
was
in
a
state
of
considerable
irritation
.
 
<EOS>
They
might
have
been
talking
,
thus
,
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
more
,
when
Monks
---
by
which
name
the
Jew
had
designated
the
strange
man
several
times
in
the
course
of
their
colloquy
---
said
,
raising
his
voice
a
little
,
   
"
I
tell
you
again
,
it
was
badly
planned
.
 
<EOS>
Why
not
have
kept
him
here
among
the
rest
,
and
made
a
sneaking
,
snivelling
pickpocket
of
him
at
once
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
hear
him
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
Jew
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
do
you
mean
to
say
you
could
n't
have
done
it
,
if
you
had
chosen
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Monks
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
n't
you
done
it
,
with
other
boys
,
scores
of
times
?
 
<EOS>
If
you
had
had
patience
for
a
twelvemonth
,
at
most
,
could
n't
you
have
got
him
convicted
,
and
sent
safely
out
of
the
kingdom
;
perhaps
for
life
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Whose
turn
would
that
have
served
,
my
dear
?
"
inquired
the
Jew
humbly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mine
,
"
replied
Monks
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
not
mine
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
submissively
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
might
have
become
of
use
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
there
are
two
parties
to
a
bargain
,
it
is
only
reasonable
that
the
interests
of
both
should
be
consulted
;
is
it
,
my
good
friend
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
then
?
"
demanded
Monks
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
saw
it
was
not
easy
to
train
him
to
the
business
,
"
replied
the
Jew
;
"
he
was
not
like
other
boys
in
the
same
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Curse
him
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
the
man
,
"
or
he
would
have
been
a
thief
,
long
ago
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
no
hold
upon
him
to
make
him
worse
,
"
pursued
the
Jew
,
anxiously
watching
the
countenance
of
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
hand
was
not
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
nothing
to
frighten
him
with
;
which
we
always
must
have
in
the
beginning
,
or
we
labour
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
What
could
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
Send
him
out
with
the
Dodger
and
Charley
?
 
<EOS>
We
had
enough
of
that
,
at
first
,
my
dear
;
I
trembled
for
us
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
THAT
was
not
my
doing
,
"
observed
Monks
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
my
dear
!
"
renewed
the
Jew
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
do
n't
quarrel
with
it
now
;
because
,
if
it
had
never
happened
,
you
might
never
have
clapped
eyes
on
the
boy
to
notice
him
,
and
so
led
to
the
discovery
that
it
was
him
you
were
looking
for
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
I
got
him
back
for
you
by
means
of
the
girl
;
and
then
SHE
begins
to
favour
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Throttle
the
girl
!
"
said
Monks
,
impatiently
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
we
ca
n't
afford
to
do
that
just
now
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
the
Jew
,
smiling
;
"
and
,
besides
,
that
sort
of
thing
is
not
in
our
way
;
or
,
one
of
these
days
,
I
might
be
glad
to
have
it
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
these
girls
are
,
Monks
,
well
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
boy
begins
to
harden
,
she
'll
care
no
more
for
him
,
than
for
a
block
of
wood
.
 
<EOS>
You
want
him
made
a
thief
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
is
alive
,
I
can
make
him
one
from
this
time
;
and
,
if
---
if
---
"
said
the
Jew
,
drawing
nearer
to
the
other
,
<EOS>
---
"
it
's
not
likely
,
mind
,
---
but
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
,
and
he
is
dead
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
It
's
no
fault
of
mine
if
he
is
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
the
other
man
,
with
a
look
of
terror
,
and
clasping
the
Jew
's
arm
with
trembling
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mind
that
.
 
<EOS>
Fagin
!
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
hand
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Anything
but
his
death
,
I
told
you
from
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
shed
blood
;
it
's
always
found
out
,
and
haunts
a
man
besides
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
shot
him
dead
,
I
was
not
the
cause
;
do
you
hear
me
?
 
<EOS>
Fire
this
infernal
den
!
 
<EOS>
What
's
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
cried
the
Jew
,
grasping
the
coward
round
the
body
,
with
both
arms
,
as
he
sprung
to
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
   
"
Yonder
!
<EOS>
replied
the
man
,
glaring
at
the
opposite
wall
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
shadow
!
 
<EOS>
I
saw
the
shadow
of
a
woman
,
in
a
cloak
and
bonnet
,
pass
along
the
wainscot
like
a
breath
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
released
his
hold
,
and
they
rushed
tumultuously
from
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
candle
,
wasted
by
the
draught
,
was
standing
where
it
had
been
placed
.
 
<EOS>
It
showed
them
only
the
empty
staircase
,
and
their
own
white
faces
.
 
<EOS>
They
listened
intently
:
 
a
profound
silence
reigned
throughout
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
your
fancy
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
taking
up
the
light
and
turning
to
his
companion
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
swear
I
saw
it
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Monks
,
trembling
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
bending
forward
when
I
saw
it
first
;
and
when
I
spoke
,
it
darted
away
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Jew
glanced
contemptuously
at
the
pale
face
of
his
associate
,
and
,
telling
him
he
could
follow
,
if
he
pleased
,
ascended
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
They
looked
into
all
the
rooms
;
they
were
cold
,
bare
,
and
empty
.
 
<EOS>
They
descended
into
the
passage
,
and
thence
into
the
cellars
below
.
 
<EOS>
The
green
damp
hung
upon
the
low
walls
;
the
tracks
of
the
snail
and
slug
glistened
in
the
light
of
the
candle
;
but
all
was
still
as
death
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
now
?
"
said
the
Jew
,
when
they
had
regained
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Besides
ourselves
,
there
's
not
a
creature
in
the
house
except
Toby
and
the
boys
;
and
they
're
safe
enough
.
<EOS>
See
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
a
proof
of
the
fact
,
the
Jew
drew
forth
two
keys
from
his
pocket
;
and
explained
,
that
when
he
first
went
downstairs
,
he
had
locked
them
in
,
to
prevent
any
intrusion
on
the
conference
.
   
<EOS>
This
accumulated
testimony
effectually
staggered
Mr
Monks
.
<EOS>
His
protestations
had
gradually
become
less
and
less
vehement
as
they
proceeded
in
their
search
without
making
any
discovery
;
and
,
now
,
he
gave
vent
to
several
very
grim
laughs
,
and
confessed
it
could
only
have
been
his
excited
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
He
declined
any
renewal
of
the
conversation
,
however
,
for
that
night
:
 
suddenly
remembering
that
it
was
past
one
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
the
amiable
couple
parted
.

Chapter
27
.
<EOS>
Atones
for
the
unpoliteness
of
a
former
chapter
;
which
deserted
a
lady
,
most
unceremoniously
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
would
be
,
by
no
means
,
seemly
in
a
humble
author
to
keep
so
mighty
a
personage
as
a
beadle
waiting
,
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
and
the
skirts
of
his
coat
gathered
up
under
his
arms
,
until
such
time
as
it
might
suit
his
pleasure
to
relieve
him
;
and
as
it
would
still
less
become
his
station
,
or
his
gallentry
to
involve
in
the
same
neglect
a
lady
on
whom
that
beadle
had
looked
with
an
eye
of
tenderness
and
affection
,
and
in
whose
ear
he
had
whispered
sweet
words
,
which
,
coming
from
such
a
quarter
,
might
well
thrill
the
bosom
of
maid
or
matron
of
whatsoever
degree
;
<EOS>
the
historian
whose
pen
traces
these
words
---
trusting
that
he
knows
his
place
,
and
that
he
entertains
a
becoming
reverence
for
those
upon
earth
to
whom
high
and
important
authority
is
delegated
---
hastens
to
pay
them
that
respect
which
their
position
demands
,
and
to
treat
them
with
all
that
duteous
ceremony
which
their
exalted
rank
,
and
(
by
consequence
)
great
virtues
,
imperatively
claim
at
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Towards
this
end
,
indeed
,
he
had
purposed
to
introduce
,
in
this
place
,
a
dissertation
touching
the
divine
right
of
beadles
,
and
elucidative
of
the
position
,
that
a
beadle
can
do
no
wrong
:
 
which
could
not
fail
to
have
been
both
pleasurable
and
profitable
to
the
right
-
minded
reader
but
which
he
is
unfortunately
compelled
,
by
want
of
time
and
space
,
to
postpone
to
some
more
convenient
and
fitting
opportunity
;
on
the
arrival
of
which
,
he
will
be
prepared
to
show
,
that
a
beadle
properly
constituted
:
 
that
is
to
say
,
a
parochial
beadle
,
attached
to
a
parochail
workhouse
,
and
attending
in
his
official
capacity
the
parochial
church
:
 
is
,
in
right
and
virtue
of
his
office
,
possessed
of
all
the
excellences
and
best
qualities
of
humanity
;
and
that
to
none
of
those
excellences
,
can
mere
companies
'
beadles
,
or
court
-
of
-
law
beadles
,
or
even
chapel
-
of
-
ease
beadles
(
save
the
last
,
and
they
in
a
very
lowly
and
inferior
degree
)
,
lay
the
remotest
sustainable
claim
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
had
re
-
counted
the
teaspoons
<EOS>
,
re
-
weighed
the
sugar
-
tongs
,
made
a
closer
inspection
of
the
milk
-
pot
,
and
ascertained
to
a
nicety
the
exact
condition
of
the
furniture
,
down
to
the
very
horse
-
hair
seats
of
the
chairs
;
and
had
repeated
each
process
full
half
a
dozen
times
;
before
he
began
to
think
that
it
was
time
for
Mrs
Corney
to
return
.
<EOS>
Thinking
begets
thinking
;
as
there
were
no
sounds
of
Mrs
Corney
's
approach
,
it
occured
to
Mr
Bumble
that
it
would
be
an
innocent
and
virtuous
way
of
spending
the
time
,
if
he
were
further
to
allay
his
curiousity
by
a
cursory
glance
at
the
interior
of
Mrs
Corney
's
chest
of
drawers
.
   
<EOS>
Having
listened
at
the
keyhole
,
to
assure
himself
that
nobody
was
approaching
the
chamber
,
Mr
Bumble
,
beginning
at
the
bottom
,
proceeded
to
make
himself
acquainted
with
the
contents
of
the
three
long
drawers
:
which
,
being
filled
with
various
garments
of
good
fashion
and
texture
,
carefully
preserved
between
two
layers
of
old
newspapers
,
speckled
with
dried
lavender
:
seemed
to
yield
him
exceeding
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
Arriving
,
in
course
of
time
,
at
the
right
-
hand
corner
drawer
(
in
which
was
the
key
)
,
and
beholding
therein
a
small
padlocked
box
,
which
,
being
shaken
,
gave
forth
a
pleasant
sound
,
as
of
the
chinking
of
coin
,
Mr
Bumble
returned
with
a
stately
walk
to
the
fireplace
;
and
,
resuming
his
old
attitude
,
said
,
with
a
grave
and
determined
air
,
"
I
'll
do
it
!
"
<EOS>
He
followed
up
this
remarkable
declaration
,
by
shaking
his
head
in
a
waggish
manner
for
ten
minutes
,
as
though
he
were
remonstrating
with
himself
for
being
such
a
pleasant
dog
;
and
then
,
he
took
a
view
of
his
legs
in
profile
,
with
much
seeming
pleasure
and
interest
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
still
placidly
engaged
in
this
latter
survey
,
when
Mrs
Corney
,
hurrying
into
the
room
,
threw
herself
,
in
a
breathless
state
,
on
a
chair
by
the
fireside
,
and
covering
her
eyes
with
one
hand
,
placed
the
other
over
her
heart
,
and
gasped
for
breath
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Corney
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
stooping
over
the
matron
,
"
what
is
this
,
ma'am
?
 
<EOS>
Has
anything
happened
,
ma'am
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
answer
me
:
<EOS>
I
'm
on
---
on
---
"
Mr
Bumble
,
in
his
alarm
,
could
not
immediately
think
of
the
word
"
tenterhooks
,
"
so
he
said
"
broken
bottles
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr
Bumble
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
lady
,
"
I
have
been
so
dreadfully
put
out
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Put
out
,
ma'am
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mr
Bumble
;
"
who
has
dared
to
---
?
 
<EOS>
I
know
!
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
checking
himself
,
with
native
majesty
,
"
this
is
them
wicious
paupers
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
dreadful
to
think
of
!
"
said
the
lady
,
shuddering
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
DON'T
think
of
it
,
ma'am
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
"
whimpered
the
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
take
something
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
soothingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
little
of
the
wine
?
"
   
"
Not
for
the
world
!
"
replied
Mrs
Corney
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
,
---
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
The
top
shelf
in
the
right
-
hand
corner
---
<EOS>
oh
!
"
 
<EOS>
Uttering
these
words
,
the
good
lady
pointed
,
distractedly
,
to
the
cupboard
,
and
underwent
a
convulsion
from
internal
spasms
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
rushed
to
the
closet
;
and
,
snatching
a
pint
green
-
glass
bottle
from
the
shelf
thus
incoherently
indicated
,
filled
a
tea
-
cup
with
its
contents
,
and
held
it
to
the
lady
's
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
better
now
,
"
said
Mrs
Corney
,
falling
back
,
after
drinking
half
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
raised
his
eyes
piously
to
the
ceiling
in
thankfulness
;
and
,
bringing
them
down
again
to
the
brim
of
the
cup
,
lifted
it
to
his
nose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Peppermint
,
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Corney
,
in
a
faint
voice
,
smiling
gently
on
the
beadle
as
she
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
"
Try
it
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
little
---
a
little
something
else
in
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
tasted
the
medicine
with
a
doubtful
look
;
smacked
his
lips
;
took
another
taste
;
and
put
the
cup
down
empty
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
comforting
,
"
said
Mrs
Corney
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
much
so
indeed
,
ma'am
,
"
said
the
beadle
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
drew
a
chair
beside
the
matron
,
and
tenderly
inquired
what
had
happened
to
distress
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
replied
Mrs
Corney
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
foolish
,
excitable
,
weak
creetur
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
Not
weak
,
ma'am
,
"
retorted
Mr
Bumble
,
drawing
his
chair
a
little
closer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
a
weak
creetur
,
Mrs
Corney
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
all
weak
creeturs
,
"
said
Mrs
Corney
,
laying
down
a
general
principle
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
we
are
,
"
said
the
beadle
.
   
<EOS>
Nothing
was
said
on
either
side
,
for
a
minute
or
two
afterwards
.
<EOS>
By
the
expiration
of
that
time
,
Mr
Bumble
had
illustrated
the
position
by
removing
his
left
arm
from
the
back
of
Mrs
Corney
's
chair
,
where
it
had
previously
rested
,
to
Mrs
Corney
's
aprong
-
string
,
round
which
is
gradually
became
entwined
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
all
weak
creeturs
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Corney
sighed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
sigh
,
Mrs
Corney
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
"
said
Mrs
Corney
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
sighed
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
very
comfortable
room
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
looking
round
.
 
<EOS>
"
Another
room
,
and
this
,
ma'am
,
would
be
a
complete
thing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
too
much
for
one
,
"
murmured
the
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
not
for
two
,
ma'am
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Bumble
,
in
soft
accents
.
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
Mrs
Corney
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Corney
drooped
her
head
,
when
the
beadle
said
this
;
the
beadle
drooped
his
,
to
get
a
view
of
Mrs
Corney
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Corney
,
with
great
propriety
,
turned
her
head
away
,
and
released
her
hand
to
get
at
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
;
but
insensibly
replaced
it
in
that
of
Mr
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
board
allows
you
coals
,
do
n't
they
,
Mrs
Corney
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
beadle
,
affectionately
pressing
her
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
candles
,
"
replied
Mrs
Corney
,
slightly
returning
the
pressure
.
   
<EOS>
"
Coals
,
candles
,
and
house
-
rent
free
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mrs
Corney
,
what
an
Angel
you
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
lady
was
not
proof
against
this
burst
of
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
She
sank
into
Mr
Bumble
's
arms
;
and
that
gentleman
in
his
agitation
,
imprinted
a
passionate
kiss
upon
her
chaste
nose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Such
porochial
perfection
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Bumble
,
rapturously
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
Mr
Slout
is
worse
to
-
night
,
my
fascinator
?
"
   
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Mrs
Corney
,
bashfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
ca
n't
live
a
week
,
the
doctor
says
,
"
pursued
Mr
Bumble
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
the
master
of
this
establishment
;
his
death
will
cause
a
wacancy
;
that
wacancy
must
be
filled
up
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mrs
Corney
,
what
a
prospect
this
opens
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
opportunity
for
a
jining
of
hearts
and
housekeepings
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Corney
sobbed
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
little
word
?
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
bending
over
the
bashful
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
one
little
,
little
,
little
word
,
my
blessed
Corney
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ye
---
ye
---
yes
!
"
sighed
out
the
matron
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
more
,
"
pursued
the
beadle
;
"
compose
your
darling
feelings
for
only
one
more
.
 
<EOS>
When
is
it
to
come
off
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Corney
twice
essayed
to
speak
:
 
and
twice
failed
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
summoning
up
courage
,
she
threw
her
arms
around
Mr
Bumble
's
neck
,
and
said
,
it
might
be
as
soon
as
ever
he
pleased
,
and
that
he
was
"
a
irresistible
duck
.
"
   
<EOS>
Matters
being
thus
amicably
and
satisfactorily
arranged
,
the
contract
was
solemnly
ratified
in
another
teacupful
of
the
peppermint
mixture
;
which
was
rendered
the
more
necessary
,
by
the
flutter
and
agitation
of
the
lady
's
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
While
it
was
being
disposed
of
,
she
acquainted
Mr
Bumble
with
the
old
woman
's
decease
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
said
that
gentleman
,
sipping
his
peppermint
;
"
I
'll
call
at
Sowerberry
's
as
I
go
home
,
and
tell
him
to
send
to
-
morrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Was
it
that
as
frightened
you
,
love
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
n't
anything
particular
,
dear
,
"
said
the
lady
evasively
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
must
have
been
something
,
love
,
"
urged
Mr
Bumble
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
tell
your
own
B
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
now
,
"
rejoined
the
lady
;
"
one
of
these
days
.
 
<EOS>
After
we
're
married
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
After
we
're
married
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
n't
any
impudence
from
any
of
them
<EOS>
male
paupers
as
---
"
   
"
No
,
no
,
love
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
the
lady
,
hastily
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
thought
it
was
,
"
continued
Mr
Bumble
;
"
if
I
thought
as
any
one
of
'em
had
dared
to
lift
his
wulgar
eyes
to
that
lovely
countenance
---
"
   
"
They
would
n't
have
dared
to
do
it
,
love
,
"
responded
the
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
had
better
not
!
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
clenching
his
fist
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
any
man
,
porochial
or
extra
-
porochial
,
as
would
presume
to
do
it
;
and
I
can
tell
him
that
he
would
n't
do
it
a
second
time
!
"
   
<EOS>
Unembellished
by
any
violence
of
gesticulation
,
this
might
have
seemed
no
very
high
compliment
to
the
lady
's
charms
;
but
,
as
Mr
Bumble
accompanied
the
threat
with
many
warlike
gestures
,
she
was
much
touched
with
this
proof
of
his
devotion
,
and
protested
,
with
great
admiration
,
that
he
was
indeed
a
dove
.
   
<EOS>
The
dove
then
turned
up
his
coat
-
collar
,
and
put
on
his
cocked
hat
;
and
,
having
exchanged
a
long
and
affectionate
embrace
with
his
future
partner
,
once
again
braved
the
cold
wind
of
the
night
:
merely
pausing
,
for
a
few
minutes
,
in
the
male
paupers
'
ward
,
to
abuse
them
a
little
,
with
the
view
of
satisfying
himself
that
he
could
fill
the
office
of
workhouse
-
master
with
needful
acerbity
.
<EOS>
Assured
of
his
qualifications
,
Mr
Bumble
left
the
building
with
a
light
heart
,
and
bright
visions
of
his
future
promotion
:
 
which
served
to
occupy
his
mind
until
he
reached
the
shop
of
the
undertaker
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Sowerberry
having
gone
out
to
tea
and
supper
:
and
Noah
Claypole
not
being
at
any
time
disposed
to
take
upon
himself
a
greater
amount
of
physical
exertion
than
is
necessary
to
a
convenient
performance
of
the
two
functions
of
eating
and
drinking
,
the
shop
was
not
closed
,
although
it
was
past
the
usual
hour
of
shutting
-
up
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
tapped
with
his
cane
on
the
counter
several
times
;
but
,
attracting
no
attention
,
and
beholding
a
light
shining
through
the
glass
-
window
of
the
little
parlour
at
the
back
of
the
shop
,
he
made
bold
to
peep
in
and
see
what
was
going
forward
;
and
when
he
saw
what
was
going
forward
,
he
was
not
a
little
surprised
.
   
<EOS>
The
cloth
was
laid
for
supper
;
the
table
was
covered
with
bread
and
butter
,
plates
and
glasses
;
a
porter
-
pot
and
a
wine
-
bottle
.
<EOS>
At
the
upper
end
of
the
table
,
Mr
Noah
Claypole
lolled
negligently
in
an
easy
-
chair
,
with
his
legs
thrown
over
one
of
the
arms
:
an
open
clasp
-
knife
in
one
hand
,
and
a
mass
of
buttered
bread
in
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Close
beside
him
stood
Charlotte
,
opening
oysters
from
a
barrel
:
which
Mr
Claypole
condescended
to
swallow
,
with
remarkable
avidity
.
 
<EOS>
A
more
than
ordinary
redness
in
the
region
of
the
young
gentleman
's
nose
,
and
a
kind
of
fixed
wink
in
his
right
eye
,
denoted
that
he
was
in
a
slight
degree
intoxicated
;
these
symptoms
were
confirmed
by
the
intense
relish
with
which
he
took
his
oysters
,
for
which
nothing
but
a
strong
appreciation
of
their
cooling
properties
,
in
cases
of
internal
fever
,
could
have
sufficiently
accounted
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
delicious
fat
one
,
Noah
,
dear
!
"
<EOS>
said
Charlotte
;
"
try
him
,
do
;
only
this
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
delicious
thing
is
a
oyster
!
"
<EOS>
remarked
Mr
Claypole
,
after
he
had
swallowed
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
pity
it
is
,
a
number
of
'em
should
ever
make
you
feel
uncomfortable
;
is
n't
it
,
Charlotte
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
a
cruelty
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
it
is
,
"
acquiesced
Mr
Claypole
.
"
<EOS>
An't
<EOS>
yer
fond
of
oysters
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
overmuch
,
"
replied
Charlotte
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
like
to
see
you
eat
'em
,
<EOS>
Noah
dear
,
better
than
eating
'em
myself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
!
<EOS>
"
said
Noah
,
reflectively
;
"
how
queer
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
another
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
one
with
such
a
beautiful
,
delicate
beard
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
manage
any
more
,
"
said
Noah
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
sorry
.
 
<EOS>
Come
here
,
Charlotte
,
and
I
'll
kiss
yer
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
bursting
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
Say
that
again
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Charlotte
uttered
a
scream
,
and
hid
her
face
in
her
apron
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Claypole
,
without
making
any
further
change
in
his
position
than
suffering
his
legs
to
reach
the
ground
,
gazed
at
the
beadle
in
drunken
terror
.
   
<EOS>
"
Say
it
again
,
you
wile
,
owdacious
fellow
!
"
said
Mr
Bumble
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
dare
you
mention
such
a
thing
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
And
how
dare
you
encourage
him
<EOS>
,
you
insolent
minx
?
 
<EOS>
Kiss
her
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mr
Bumble
,
in
strong
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Faugh
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
mean
to
do
it
!
"
<EOS>
said
Noah
,
blubbering
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
's
always
a

kissing
of
me
,
whether
I
like
it
,
or
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Noah
,
"
cried
Charlotte
,
reproachfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yer
are
;
yer
know
yer
are

"
retorted
Noah
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
's
always
a

doin

of
it
,
Mr
Bumble
,
sir
<EOS>
;
she
chucks
me
under
the
chin
,
please
,
sir
;
and
makes
all
manner
of
love
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Silence
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Bumble
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
yourself
downstairs
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
Noah
,
you
shut
up
the
shop
;
say
another
word
till
your
master
comes
home
,
at
your
peril
;
and
,
when
he
does
come
home
,
tell
him
that
Mr
Bumble
said
he
was
to
send
a
old
woman
's
shell
after
breakfast
to
-
morrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Kissing
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Mr
Bumble
,
holding
up
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
sin
and
wickedness
of
the
lower
orders
in
this
porochial
district
is
frightful
!
 
<EOS>
If
Parliament
do
n't
take
their
abominable
courses
under
consideration
,
this
country
's
ruined
,
and
the
character
of
the
peasantry
gone
for
ever
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
the
beadle
strode
,
with
a
lofty
and
gloomy
air
,
from
the
undertaker
's
premises
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
that
we
have
accompanied
him
so
far
on
his
road
home
,
and
have
made
all
necessary
preparations
for
the
old
woman
's
funeral
,
let
us
set
on
foot
a
few
inquires
after
young
Oliver
Twist
,
and
ascertain
whether
he
be
still
lying
in
the
ditch
where
Toby
Crackit
left
him
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter

<EOS>
Looks
after
Oliver
,
and
proceeds
with
his
adventures
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wolves
tear
your
throats
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Sikes
,
grinding
his
teeth
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
was
among
some
of
you
;
you
'd
howl
the
hoarser
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Sikes
growled
forth
this
imprecation
,
with
the
most
desperate
ferocity
that
his
desperate
nature
was
capable
of
,
he
rested
the
body
of
the
wounded
boy
across
his
bended
knee
;
and
turned
his
head
,
for
an
instant
,
to
look
back
at
his
pursuers
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
little
to
be
made
out
,
in
the
mist
and
darkness
;
but
the
loud
shouting
of
men
vibrated
through
the
air
,
and
the
barking
of
the
neighbouring
dogs
,
roused
by
the
sound
of
the
alarm
bell
,
resounded
in
every
direction
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
,
you
white
-
livered
hound
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
robber
,
shouting
after
Toby
Crackit
,
who
,
making
the
best
use
of
his
long
legs
,
was
already
ahead
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
repetition
of
the
word
,
brought
Toby
to
a
dead
stand
-
still
.
<EOS>
For
he
was
not
quite
satisfied
that
he
was
beyond
the
range
of
pistol
-
shot
;
and
Sikes
was
in
no
mood
to
be
played
with
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bear
a
hand
with
the
boy
,
"
cried
Sikes
,
beckoning
furiously
to
his
confederate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
back
!
"
   
<EOS>
Toby
made
a
show
of
returning
;
but
ventured
,
in
a
low
voice
,
broken
for
want
of
breath
,
to
intimate
considerable
reluctance
as
he
came
slowly
along
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quicker
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sikes
,
laying
the
boy
in
a
dry
ditch
at
his
feet
,
and
drawing
a
pistol
from
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
play
booty
with
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
noise
grew
louder
.
 
<EOS>
Sikes
,
again
looking
round
,
could
discern
that
the
men
who
had
given
chase
were
already
climbing
the
gate
of
the
field
in
which
he
stood
;
and
that
a
couple
of
dogs
were
some
paces
in
advance
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
up
,
Bill
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Toby
;
"
drop
the
kid
,
and
show
'em
your
heels
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
parting
advice
,
Mr
Crackit
,
preferring
the
chance
of
being
shot
by
his
friend
,
to
the
certainty
of
being
taken
by
his
enemies
,
fairly
turned
tail
,
and
darted
off
at
full
speed
.
 
<EOS>
Sikes
clenched
his
teeth
;
took
one
look
around
;
threw
over
the
prostrate
form
of
Oliver
,
the
cape
in
which
he
had
been
hurriedly
muffled
;
ran
along
the
front
of
the
hedge
,
as
if
to
distract
the
attention
of
those
behind
,
from
the
spot
where
the
boy
lay
;
paused
,
for
a
second
,
before
another
hedge
which
met
it
at
right
angles
;
and
whirling
his
pistol
high
into
the
air
,
cleared
it
at
a
bound
,
and
was
gone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ho
,
ho
,
there
!
"
cried
a
tremulous
voice
in
the
rear
.
"
<EOS>
Pincher
!
<EOS>
Neptune
!
 
<EOS>
Come
here
,
come
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
dogs
,
who
,
in
common
with
their
masters
,
seemed
to
have
no
particular
relish
for
the
sport
in
which
they
were
engaged
,
readily
answered
to
the
command
.
 
<EOS>
Three
men
,
who
had
by
this
time
advanced
some
distance
into
the
field
,
stopped
to
take
counsel
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
advice
,
or
,
leastways
<EOS>
,
I
should
say
,
my
ORDERS
,
is
,
"
said
the
fattest
man
of
the
party
,
"
that
we
"
mediately
go
home
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
agreeable
to
anything
which
is
agreeable
to
Mr
Giles
,
"
said
a
shorter
man
;
who
was
by
no
means
of
a
slim
figure
,
and
who
was
very
pale
in
the
face
,
and
very
polite
:
as
frightened
men
frequently
are
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
wish
to
appear
ill
-
mannered
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
the
third
,
who
had
called
the
dogs
back
,
"
Mr
Giles
ought
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
replied
the
shorter
man
;
"
and
whatever
Mr
Giles
says
,
it
is
n't
our
place
to
contradict
him
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
I
know
my
sitiwation
!
 
<EOS>
Thank
my
stars
<EOS>
,
I
know
my
sitiwation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
To
tell
the
truth
,
the
little
man
DID
seem
to
know
his
situation
,
and
to
know
perfectly
well
that
it
was
by
no
means
a
desirable
one
;
for
his
teeth
chattered
in
his
head
as
he
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
afraid
,
Brittles
,
"
said
Mr
Giles
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
an't
,
"
said
Brittles
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
,
"
said
Giles
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
falsehood
,
Mr
Giles
,
"
said
Brittles
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
lie
,
Brittles
,
"
said
Mr
Giles
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
these
four
retorts
arose
from
Mr
Giles
's
taunt
;
and
Mr
Giles
's
taunt
had
arisen
from
his
indignation
at
having
the
responsibility
of
going
home
again
,
imposed
upon
himself
under
cover
of
a
compliment
.
 
<EOS>
The
third
man
brought
the
dispute
to
a
close
,
most
philosophically
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
he
,
"
we
're
all
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Speak
for
yourself
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Giles
,
who
was
the
palest
of
the
party
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
do
,
"
replied
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
natural
and
proper
to
be
afraid
,
under
such
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
am
I
,
"
said
Brittles
;
"
only
there
's
no
call
to
tell
a
man
he
is
,
so
bounceably
.
"
   
<EOS>
These
frank
admissions
softened
Mr
Giles
,
who
at
once
owned
that
HE
was
afraid
;
upon
which
,
they
all
three
faced
about
,
and
ran
back
again
with
the
completest
unanimity
,
until
Mr
Giles
(
who
had
the
shortest
wind
of
the
party
,
as
was
encumbered
with
a
pitchfork
)
<EOS>
most
handsomely
insisted
on
stopping
,
to
make
an
apology
for
his
hastiness
of
speech
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
wonderful
,
"
said
Mr
Giles
,
when
he
had
explained
,
"
what
a
man
will
do
,
when
his
blood
is
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
committed
murder
---
I
know
I
should
---
if
we
'd
caught
one
of
them
rascals
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
other
two
were
impressed
with
a
similar
presentiment
;
and
as
their
blood
,
like
his
,
had
all
gone
down
again
;
some
speculation
ensued
upon
the
cause
of
this
sudden
change
in
their
temperament
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
it
was
,
"
said
Mr
Giles
;
"
it
was
the
gate
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
wonder
if
it
was
,
"
exclaimed
Brittles
,
catching
at
the
idea
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
depend
upon
it
,
"
said
Giles
,
"
that
that
gate
stopped
the
flow
of
the
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
all
mine
suddenly
going
away
,
as
I
was
climbing
over
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
By
a
remarkable
coincidence
,
the
other
two
had
been
visited
with
the
same
unpleasant
sensation
at
that
precise
moment
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
obvious
,
therefore
,
that
it
was
the
gate
;
especially
as
there
was
no
doubt
regarding
the
time
at
which
the
change
had
taken
place
,
because
all
three
remembered
that
they
had
come
in
sight
of
the
robbers
at
the
instant
of
its
occurance
.
   
<EOS>
This
dialogue
was
held
between
the
two
men
who
had
surprised
the
burglars
,
and
a
travelling
tinker
who
had
been
sleeping
in
an
outhouse
,
and
who
had
been
roused
,
together
with
his
two
mongrel
curs
,
to
join
in
the
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Giles
acted
in
the
double
capacity
of
butler
and
steward
to
the
old
lady
of
the
mansion
;
Brittles
was
a
lad
of
all
-
work
:
who
,
having
entered
her
service
a
mere
child
,
was
treated
as
a
promising
young
boy
still
,
though
he
was
something
past
thirty
.
   
<EOS>
Encouraging
each
other
with
such
converse
as
this
;
but
,
keeping
very
close
together
,
notwithstanding
,
and
looking
apprehensively
round
,
whenever
a
fresh
gust
rattled
through
the
boughs
;
the
three
men
hurried
back
to
a
tree
,
behind
which
they
had
left
their
lantern
,
lest
its
light
should
inform
the
thieves
in
what
direction
to
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Catching
up
the
light
,
they
made
the
best
of
their
way
home
,
at
a
good
round
trot
;
and
long
after
their
dusky
forms
had
ceased
to
be
discernible
,
the
light
might
have
been
seen
twinkling
and
dancing
in
the
distance
,
like
some
exhalation
of
the
damp
and
gloomy
atmosphere
through
which
it
was
swiftly
borne
.
   
<EOS>
The
air
grew
colder
,
as
day
came
slowly
on
;
and
the
mist
rolled
along
the
ground
like
a
dense
cloud
of
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
The
grass
was
wet
;
the
pathways
,
and
low
places
,
were
all
mire
and
water
;
the
damp
breath
of
an
unwholesome
wind
went
languidly
by
,
with
a
hollow
moaning
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
Oliver
lay
motionless
and
insensible
on
the
spot
where
Sikes
had
left
him
.
   
<EOS>
Morning
drew
on
apace
.
 
<EOS>
The
air
become
more
sharp
and
piercing
,
as
its
first
dull
hue
---
the
death
of
night
,
rather
than
the
birth
of
day
---
glimmered
faintly
in
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
The
objects
which
had
looked
dim
and
terrible
in
the
darkness
,
grew
more
and
more
defined
,
and
gradually
resolved
into
their
familiar
shapes
.
 
<EOS>
The
rain
came
down
,
thick
and
fast
,
and
pattered
noisily
among
the
leafless
bushes
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Oliver
felt
it
not
,
as
it
beat
against
him
;
for
he
still
lay
stretched
,
helpless
and
unconscious
,
on
his
bed
of
clay
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
,
a
low
cry
of
pain
broke
the
stillness
that
prevailed
;
and
uttering
it
,
the
boy
awoke
.
 
<EOS>
His
left
arm
,
rudely
bandaged
in
a
shawl
,
hung
heavy
and
useless
at
his
side
;
the
bandage
was
saturated
with
blood
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
weak
,
that
he
could
scarcely
raise
himself
into
a
sitting
posture
;
when
he
had
done
so
,
he
looked
feebly
round
for
help
,
and
groaned
with
pain
.
 
<EOS>
Trembling
in
every
joint
,
from
cold
and
exhaustion
,
he
made
an
effort
to
stand
upright
;
but
,
shuddering
from
head
to
foot
,
fell
prostrate
on
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
After
a
short
return
of
the
stupor
in
which
he
had
been
so
long
plunged
,
Oliver
:
 
urged
by
a
creeping
sickness
at
his
heart
,
which
seemed
to
warn
him
that
if
he
lay
there
,
he
must
surely
die
:
 
got
upon
his
feet
,
and
essayed
to
walk
.
<EOS>
His
head
was
dizzy
,
and
he
staggered
to
and
from
like
a
drunken
man
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
kept
up
,
nevertheless
,
and
,
with
his
head
drooping
languidly
on
his
breast
,
went
stumbling
onward
,
he
knew
not
whither
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
,
hosts
of
bewildering
and
confused
ideas
came
crowding
on
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
still
walking
between
Sikes
and
Crackit
,
who
were
angrily
disputing
---
for
the
very
words
they
said
,
sounded
in
his
ears
;
and
when
he
caught
his
own
attention
,
as
it
were
,
by
making
some
violent
effort
to
save
himself
from
falling
,
he
found
that
he
was
talking
to
them
.
<EOS>
Then
,
he
was
alone
with
Sikes
,
plodding
on
as
on
the
previous
day
;
and
as
shadowy
people
passed
them
,
he
felt
the
robber
's
grasp
upon
his
wrist
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
he
started
back
at
the
report
of
fire
-
arms
;
there
rose
into
the
air
,
loud
cries
and
shouts
;
lights
gleamed
before
his
eyes
;
all
was
noise
and
tumult
,
as
some
unseen
hand
bore
him
hurriedly
away
.
 
<EOS>
Through
all
these
rapid
visions
,
there
ran
an
undefined
,
uneasy
conscious
of
pain
,
which
wearied
and
tormented
him
incessantly
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
he
staggered
on
,
creeping
,
almost
mechanically
,
between
the
bars
of
gates
,
or
through
hedge
-
gaps
as
they
came
in
his
way
,
until
he
reached
a
road
.
 
<EOS>
Here
the
rain
began
to
fall
so
heavily
,
that
it
roused
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
looked
about
,
and
saw
that
at
no
great
distance
there
was
a
house
,
which
perhaps
he
could
reach
.
 
<EOS>
Pitying
his
condition
,
they
might
have
compassion
on
him
;
and
if
they
did
not
,
it
would
be
better
,
he
thought
,
to
die
near
human
beings
,
than
in
the
lonely
open
fields
.
 
<EOS>
He
summoned
up
all
his
strength
for
one
last
trial
,
and
bent
his
faltering
steps
towards
it
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
drew
nearer
to
this
house
,
a
feeling
come
over
him
that
he
had
seen
it
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
remembered
nothing
of
its
details
;
but
the
shape
and
aspect
of
the
building
seemed
familiar
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
That
garden
wall
!
 
<EOS>
On
the
grass
inside
,
he
had
fallen
on
his
knees
last
night
,
and
prayed
the
two
men
's
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
very
house
they
had
attempted
to
rob
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
felt
such
fear
come
over
him
when
he
recognised
the
place
,
that
,
for
the
instant
,
he
forgot
the
agony
of
his
wound
,
and
thought
only
of
flight
.
 
<EOS>
Flight
!
 
<EOS>
He
could
scarcely
stand
:
 
and
if
he
were
in
full
possession
of
all
the
best
powers
of
his
slight
and
youthful
frame
,
whither
could
he
fly
?
 
<EOS>
He
pushed
against
the
garden
-
gate
;
it
was
unlocked
,
and
swung
open
on
its
hinges
.
 
<EOS>
He
tottered
across
the
lawn
;
climbed
the
steps
;
knocked
faintly
at
the
door
;
and
,
his
whole
strength
failing
him
,
sunk
down
against
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
little
portico
.
   
<EOS>
It
happened
that
about
this
time
,
Mr
Giles
,
Brittles
,
and
the
tinker
,
were
recruiting
themselves
,
after
the
fatigues
and
terrors
of
the
night
,
with
tea
and
sundries
,
in
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
it
was
Mr
Giles
's
habit
to
admit
to
too
great
familiarity
the
humbler
servants
:
towards
whom
it
was
rather
his
wo
nt
to
deport
himself
with
a
lofty
affability
,
which
,
while
it
gratified
,
could
not
fail
to
remind
them
of
his
superior
position
in
society
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
death
,
fires
,
and
burglary
,
make
all
men
equals
;
so
Mr
Giles
sat
with
his
legs
stretched
out
before
the
kitchen
fender
,
leaning
his
left
arm
on
the
table
,
while
,
with
his
right
,
he
illustrated
a
circumstantial
and
minute
account
of
the
robbery
,
to
which
his
bearers
(
but
especially
the
cook
and
housemaid
,
who
were
of
the
party
)
listened
with
breathless
interest
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
about
half
-
past
tow
,
"
said
Mr
Giles
,
"
or
I
would
n't
swear
that
it
might
n't
have
been
a
little
nearer
three
,
when
I
woke
up
,
and
,
turning
round
in
my
bed
,
as
it
might
be
so
,
(
here
Mr
Giles
turned
round
in
his
chair
,
and
pulled
the
corner
of
the
table
-
cloth
over
him
to
imitate
bed
-
clothes
,
)
<EOS>
I
fancied
I
heerd
a
noise
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
point
of
the
narrative
the
cook
turned
pale
,
and
asked
the
housemaid
to
shut
the
door
:
who
asked
Brittles
,
who
asked
the
tinker
,
who
pretended
not
to
hear
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
Heerd
a
noise
,
"
continued
Mr
Giles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
says
,
at
first
,
"
This
is
illusion
"
;
and
was
composing
myself
off
to
sleep
,
when
I
heerd
the
noise
again
,
distinct
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
sort
of
a
noise
?
"
asked
the
cook
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
kind
of
a
busting
noise
,
"
replied
Mr
Giles
,
looking
round
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
More
like
the
noise
of
powdering
a
iron
bar
on
a
nutmeg
-
grater
,
"
suggested
Brittles
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
,
when
you
HEERD
it
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Giles
;
"
but
,
at
this
time
,
it
had
a
busting
sound
.
 
<EOS>
I
turned
down
the
clothes
"
;
continued
Giles
,
rolling
back
the
table
-
cloth
,
"
sat
up
in
bed
;
and
listened
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
cook
and
housemaid
simultaneously
ejaculated
"
Lor
!
"
and
drew
their
chairs
closer
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
heerd
it
now
,
quite
apparent
,
"
resumed
Mr
Giles
.
"
<EOS>
"
Somebody
,
"
I
says
,
"
is
forcing
of
a
door
,
or
window
;
what
's
to
be
done
?
<EOS>
I
'll
call
up
that
poor
lad
,
Brittles
,
and
save
him
from
being
murdered
in
his
bed
;
or
his
throat
,
"
I
says
,
"
may
be
cut
from
his
right
ear
to
his
left
,
without
his
ever
knowing
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
Here
,
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
Brittles
,
who
fixed
his
upon
the
speaker
,
and
stared
at
him
,
with
his
mouth
wide
open
,
and
his
face
expressive
of
the
most
unmitigated
horror
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tossed
off
the
clothes
,
"
said
Giles
,
throwing
away
the
table
-
cloth
,
and
looking
very
hard
at
the
cook
and
housemaid
,
"
got
softly
out
of
bed
;
drew
on
a
pair
of
---
"
   
"
Ladies
present
,
Mr
Giles
,
"
murmured
the
tinker
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
Of
SHOES
,
sir
,
"
said
Giles
,
turning
upon
him
,
and
laying
great
emphasis
on
the
word
;
"
seized
the
loaded
pistol
that
always
goes
upstairs
with
the
plate
-
basket
;
and
walked
on
tiptoes
to
his
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
Brittles
,
"
I
says
,
when
I
had
woke
him
,
"
do
n't
be
frightened
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
So
you
did
,
"
observed
Brittles
,
in
a
low
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
We
're
dead
men
,
I
think
,
Brittles
,
"
I
says
,
"
continued
Giles
;
"
"
but
do
n't
be
frightened
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
WAS
he
frightened
?
"
asked
the
cook
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
"
replied
Mr
Giles
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
as
firm
---
ah
!
<EOS>
pretty
near
as
firm
as
I
was
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
died
at
once
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
,
if
it
had
been
me
,
"
observed
the
housemaid
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
woman
,
"
retorted
Brittles
,
plucking
up
a
little
.
   
<EOS>
"
Brittles
is
right
,
"
said
Mr
Giles
,
nodding
his
head
,
approvingly
;
"
from
a
woman
<EOS>
,
nothing
else
was
to
be
expected
.
<EOS>
We
,
being
men
,
took
a
dark
lantern
that
was
standing
on
Brittle
's
hob
,
and
groped
our
way
downstairs
in
the
pitch
dark
,
---
as
it
might
be
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Giles
had
risen
from
his
seat
,
and
taken
two
steps
with
his
eyes
shut
,
to
accompany
his
description
with
appropriate
action
,
when
he
started
violently
,
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
company
,
and
hurried
back
to
his
chair
.
 
<EOS>
The
cook
and
housemaid
screamed
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
knock
,
"
said
Mr
Giles
,
assuming
perfect
serenity
.
<EOS>
"
Open
the
door
,
somebody
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nobody
moved
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
seems
a
strange
sort
of
a
thing
,
a
knock
coming
at
such
a
time
in
the
morning
,
"
said
Mr
Giles
,
surveying
the
pale
faces
which
surrounded
him
,
and
looking
very
blank
himself
;
"
but
the
door
must
be
opened
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
,
somebody
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Giles
,
as
he
spoke
,
looked
at
Brittles
;
but
that
young
man
,
being
naturally
modest
,
probably
considered
himself
nobody
,
and
so
held
that
the
inquiry
could
not
have
any
application
to
him
;
at
all
events
,
he
tendered
no
reply
.
<EOS>
Mr
Giles
directed
an
appealing
glance
at
the
tinker
;
but
he
had
suddenly
fallen
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
The
women
were
out
of
the
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
Brittles
would
rather
open
the
door
,
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
,
"
said
Mr
Giles
,
after
a
short
silence
,
"
I
am
ready
to
make
one
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
am
I
,
"
said
the
tinker
,
waking
up
,
as
suddenly
as
he
had
fallen
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
Brittles
capitualated
on
these
terms
;
and
the
party
being
somewhat
re
-
assured
by
the
discovery
(
made
on
throwing
open
the
shutters
)
that
it
was
now
broad
day
,
took
their
way
upstairs
;
with
the
dogs
in
front
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
women
,
who
were
afraid
to
stay
below
,
brought
up
the
rear
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
advice
of
Mr
Giles
,
they
all
talked
very
loud
,
to
warn
any
evil
-
disposed
person
outside
,
that
they
were
strong
in
numbers
;
and
by
a
master
-
stoke
of
policy
,
originating
in
the
brain
of
the
same
ingenious
gentleman
,
the
dogs
'
tails
were
well
pinched
,
in
the
hall
,
to
make
them
bark
savagely
.
   
<EOS>
These
precautions
having
been
taken
,
Mr
Giles
held
on
fast
by
the
tinker
's
arm
(
to
prevent
his
running
away
,
as
he
pleasantly
said
)
,
and
gave
the
word
of
command
to
open
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Brittles
obeyed
;
the
group
,
peeping
timorously
over
each
other
's
shoulders
,
beheld
no
more
formidable
object
than
poor
little
Oliver
Twist
,
speechless
and
exhausted
,
who
raised
his
heavy
eyes
,
and
mutely
solicited
their
compassion
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
boy
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mr
Giles
,
valiantly
,
pushing
the
tinker
into
the
background
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
with
<EOS>
the
---
eh
?
---
Why
---
Brittles
---
look
here
---
do
n't
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
   
Brittles
,
who
had
got
behind
the
door
to
open
it
,
no
sooner
saw
Oliver
,
than
he
uttered
a
loud
cry
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Giles
,
seizing
the
boy
by
one
leg
and
one
arm
(
fortunately
not
the
broken
limb
)
lugged
him
straight
into
the
hall
,
and
deposited
him
at
full
length
on
the
floor
thereof
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
he
is
!
"
<EOS>
bawled
Giles
,
calling
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
,
up
the
staircase
;
"
here
's
one
of
the
thieves
,
ma'am
!
<EOS>
Here
's
a
thief
,
miss
!
 
<EOS>
Wounded
,
miss
!
 
<EOS>
I
shot
him
,
miss
;
and
Brittles
held
the
light
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
---
In
a
lantern
,
miss
,
"
cried
Brittles
,
applying
one
hand
to
the
side
of
his
mouth
,
so
that
his
voice
might
travel
the
better
.
   
<EOS>
The
two
women
-
servants
ran
upstairs
to
carry
the
intelligence
that
Mr
Giles
had
captured
a
robber
;
and
the
tinker
busied
himself
in
endeavouring
to
restore
Oliver
,
lest
he
should
die
before
he
could
be
hanged
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
all
this
noise
and
commotion
,
there
was
heard
a
sweet
female
voice
,
which
quelled
it
in
an
instant
.
   
<EOS>
"
Giles
!
"
whispered
the
voice
from
the
stair
-
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
here
,
miss
,
"
replied
Mr
Giles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
frightened
,
miss
;
I
ai
n't
much
injured
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
n't
make
a
very
desperate
resistance
,
miss
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
soon
too
many
for
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
replied
the
young
lady
;
"
you
frighten
my
aunt
as
much
as
the
thieves
did
.
 
<EOS>
Is
the
poor
creature
much
hurt
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wounded
desperate
,
miss
,
"
replied
Giles
,
with
indescribable
complacency
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
looks
as
if
he
was
a
-
going
,
miss
,
"
bawled
Brittles
,
in
the
same
manner
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
n't
you
like
to
come
and
look
at
him
,
miss
,
in
case
he
should
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
pray
;
there
's
a
good
man
!
"
rejoined
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wait
quietly
<EOS>
only
one
instant
,
while
I
speak
to
aunt
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
a
footstep
as
soft
and
gentle
as
the
voice
,
the
speaker
tripped
away
.
 
<EOS>
She
soon
returned
,
with
the
direction
that
the
wounded
person
was
to
be
carried
,
carefully
,
upstairs
to
Mr
Giles
's
room
;
and
that
Brittles
was
to
saddle
the
pony
and
betake
himself
instantly
to
Chertsey
:
 
from
which
place
,
he
was
to
despatch
,
with
all
speed
,
a
constable
and
doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
wo
n't
you
take
one
look
at
him
,
first
,
miss
?
"
asked
Mr
Giles
,
with
as
much
pride
as
if
Oliver
were
some
bird
of
rare
plumage
,
that
he
had
skilfully
brought
down
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
one
little
peep
,
miss
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
now
,
for
the
world
,
"
replied
the
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
treat
him
kindly
,
Giles
for
my
sake
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
servant
looked
up
at
the
speaker
,
as
she
turned
away
,
with
a
glance
as
proud
and
admiring
as
if
she
had
been
his
own
child
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
bending
over
Oliver
,
he
helped
to
carry
him
upstairs
,
with
the
care
and
solicitude
of
a
woman
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
29
.
<EOS>
Has
an
introductory
account
of
the
inmates
of
the
house
,
to
which
Oliver
resorted
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
handsome
room
:
 
though
its
furniture
had
rather
the
air
of
old
-
fashioned
comfort
,
than
of
modern
elegance
:
 
there
sat
two
ladies
at
a
well
-
spread
breakfast
-
table
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Giles
,
dressed
with
scrupulous
care
in
a
full
suit
of
black
,
was
in
attendance
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
taken
his
station
some
half
-
way
between
the
side
-
board
and
the
breakfast
-
table
;
and
,
with
his
body
drawn
up
to
its
full
height
,
his
head
thrown
back
,
and
inclined
the
merest
trifle
on
one
side
,
his
left
leg
advanced
,
and
his
right
hand
thrust
into
his
waist
-
coat
,
while
his
left
hung
down
by
his
side
,
grasping
a
waiter
,
looked
like
one
who
laboured
under
a
very
agreeable
sense
of
his
own
merits
and
importance
.
   
<EOS>
Of
the
two
ladies
,
one
was
well
advanced
in
years
;
but
the
high
-
backed
oaken
chair
in
which
she
sat
,
was
not
more
upright
than
she
.
 
<EOS>
Dressed
with
the
utmost
nicety
and
precision
,
in
a
quaint
mixture
of
by
-
gone
costume
,
with
some
slight
concessions
to
the
prevailing
taste
,
which
rather
served
to
point
the
old
style
pleasantly
than
to
impair
its
effect
,
she
sat
,
in
a
stately
manner
,
with
her
hands
folded
on
the
table
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eyes
(
and
age
had
dimmed
but
little
of
their
brightness
)
were
attentively
upon
her
young
companion
.
   
<EOS>
The
younger
lady
was
in
the
lovely
bloom
and
spring
-
time
of
womanhood
;
at
that
age
,
when
,
if
ever
angels
be
for
God
's
good
purposes
enthroned
in
mortal
forms
,
they
may
be
,
without
impiety
,
supposed
to
abide
in
such
as
hers
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
not
past
seventeen
.
 
<EOS>
Cast
in
so
slight
and
exquisite
a
mould
;
so
mild
and
gentle
;
so
pure
and
beautiful
;
that
earth
seemed
not
her
element
,
nor
its
rough
creatures
her
fit
companions
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
intelligence
that
shone
in
her
deep
blue
eye
,
and
was
stamped
upon
her
noble
head
,
seemed
scarcely
of
her
age
,
or
of
the
world
;
and
yet
the
changing
expression
of
sweetness
and
good
humour
,
the
thousand
lights
that
played
about
the
face
,
and
left
no
shadow
there
;
above
all
,
the
smile
,
the
cheerful
,
happy
smile
,
were
made
for
Home
,
and
fireside
peace
and
happiness
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
busily
engaged
in
the
little
offices
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
Chancing
to
raise
her
eyes
as
the
elder
lady
was
regarding
her
<EOS>
,
she
playfully
put
back
her
hair
,
which
was
simply
braided
on
her
forehead
;
and
threw
into
her
beaming
look
,
such
an
expression
of
affection
and
artless
loveliness
,
that
blessed
spirits
might
have
smiled
to
look
upon
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
Brittles
has
been
gone
upwards
of
an
hour
,
has
he
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
old
lady
,
after
a
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
An
hour
and
twelve
minutes
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
Mr
Giles
,
referring
to
a
silver
watch
,
which
he
drew
forth
by
a
black
ribbon
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
always
slow
,
"
remarked
the
old
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
Brittles
always
was
a
slow
boy
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
the
attendant
.
<EOS>
And
seeing
,
by
the
bye
,
that
Brittles
had
been
a
slow
boy
for
upwards
of
thirty
years
<EOS>
,
there
appeared
no
great
probability
of
his
ever
being
a
fast
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
gets
worse
instead
of
better
,
I
think
,
"
said
the
elder
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
inexcusable
in
him
if
he
stops
to
play
with
any
other
boys
,
"
said
the
young
lady
,
smiling
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Giles
was
apparently
considering
the
propriety
of
indulging
in
a
respectful
smile
himself
,
when
a
gig
drove
up
to
the
garden
-
gate
:
out
of
which
there
jumped
a
fat
gentleman
,
who
ran
straight
up
to
the
door
:
and
who
,
getting
quickly
into
the
house
by
some
mysterious
process
,
burst
into
the
room
,
and
nearly
overturned
Mr
Giles
and
the
breakfast
-
table
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
fat
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mrs
Maylie
---
bless
my
soul
---
in
the
silence
of
the
night
,
too
---
I
NEVER
heard
of
such
a
thing
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
expressions
of
condolence
,
the
fat
gentleman
shook
hands
with
both
ladies
,
and
drawing
up
a
chair
,
inquired
how
they
found
themselves
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
be
dead
;
positively
dead
with
the
fright
,
"
said
the
fat
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
you
send
?
 
<EOS>
Bless
me
,
my
man
should
have
come
in
a
minute
;
and
so
would
I
;
and
my
assistant
would
have
been
delighted
;
or
<EOS>
anybody
,
I
'm
sure
,
under
such
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
!
 
<EOS>
So
unexpected
!
 
<EOS>
In
the
silence
of
the
night
,
too
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
doctor
seemed
especially
troubled
by
the
fact
of
the
robbery
having
been
unexpected
,
and
attempted
in
the
night
-
time
;
as
if
it
were
the
established
custom
of
gentlemen
in
the
housebreaking
way
to
transact
business
at
noon
,
and
to
make
an
appointment
,
by
post
,
a
day
or
two
previous
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
,
Miss
Rose
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
turning
to
the
young
lady
,
"
I
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
very
much
so
,
indeed
,
"
said
Rose
,
interrupting
him
;
"
but
there
is
a
poor
creature
upstairs
,
whom
aunt
wishes
you
to
see
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
to
be
sure
,
"
replied
the
doctor
,
"
<EOS>
so
there
is
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
your
handiwork
,
Giles
,
I
understand
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Giles
,
who
had
been
feverishly
putting
the
tea
-
cups
to
rights
,
blushed
very
red
,
and
said
that
he
had
had
that
honour
.
   
<EOS>
"
Honour
,
eh
?
"
said
the
doctor
;
"
well
,
I
do
n't
know
;
perhaps
it
's
as
honourable
to
hit
a
thief
in
a
back
kitchen
,
as
to
hit
your
man
at
twelve
paces
.
 
<EOS>
Fancy
that
he
fired
in
the
air
,
and
you
've
fought
a
duel
,
Giles
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Giles
,
who
thought
this
light
treatment
of
the
matter
an
unjust
attempt
at
diminishing
his
glory
,
answered
respectfully
,
that
it
was
not
for
the
like
of
him
to
judge
about
that
;
but
he
rather
thought
it
was
no
joke
to
the
opposite
party
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gad
,
that
's
true
!
"
said
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
 
<EOS>
Show
me
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
look
in
again
,
as
I
come
down
,
Mrs
Maylie
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
little
window
that
he
got
in
at
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
could
n't
have
believed
it
!

Talking
all
the
way
,
he
followed
Mr
Giles
upstairs
;
and
while
he
is
going
upstairs
,
the
reader
may
be
informed
,
that
Mr
Losberne
,
a
surgeon
in
the
neighbourhood
,
known
through
a
circuit
of
ten
miles
round
as
"
the
doctor
,
"
had
grown
fat
,
more
from
good
-
humour
than
from
good
living
:
 
and
was
as
kind
and
hearty
,
and
withal
as
eccentric
an
old
bachelor
,
as
will
be
found
in
five
times
that
space
,
by
any
explorer
alive
.
   
<EOS>
The
doctor
was
absent
,
much
longer
than
either
he
or
the
ladies
had
anticipated
.
 
<EOS>
A
large
flat
box
was
fetched
out
of
the
gig
;
and
a
bedroom
bell
was
rung
very
often
;
and
the
servants
ran
up
and
down
stairs
perpetually
;
from
which
tokens
it
was
justly
concluded
that
something
important
was
going
on
above
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
returned
;
and
in
reply
to
an
anxious
inquiry
after
his
patient
;
looked
very
mysterious
,
and
closed
the
door
,
carefully
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
very
extraordinary
thing
,
Mrs
Maylie
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
standing
with
his
back
to
the
door
,
as
if
to
keep
it
shut
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
in
danger
,
I
hope
?
"
said
the
old
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
that
would
NOT
be
an
extraordinary
thing
,
under
the
circumstances
,
"
replied
the
doctor
;
"
though
I
do
n't
think
he
is
.
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
the
thief
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
rejoined
the
old
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nor
heard
anything
about
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
ma'am
,
interposed
Mr
Giles
;
"
but
I
was
going
to
tell
you
about
him
when
Doctor
Losberne
came
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
fact
was
,
that
Mr
Giles
had
not
,
at
first
,
been
able
to
bring
his
mind
to
the
avowal
,
that
he
had
only
shot
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
Such
commendations
had
been
bestowed
upon
his
bravery
,
that
he
could
not
,
for
the
life
of
him
,
help
postponing
the
explanation
for
a
few
delicious
minutes
;
during
which
he
had
flourished
,
in
the
very
zenith
of
a
brief
reputation
for
undaunted
courage
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rose
wished
to
see
the
man
,
"
said
Mrs
Maylie
,
"
but
I
would
n't
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
rejoined
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
very
alarming
in
his
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
any
objection
to
see
him
in
my
presence
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
be
necessary
,
"
replied
the
old
lady
,
"
certainly
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
think
it
is
necessary
,
"
said
the
doctor
;
"
at
all
events
,
I
am
quite
sure
that
you
would
deeply
regret
not
having
done
so
,
if
you
postponed
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
perfectly
quiet
and
comfortable
now
.
<EOS>
Allow
me
---
Miss
Rose
,
will
you
permit
me
?
 
<EOS>
Not
the
slightest
fear
<EOS>
,
I
pledge
you
my
honour
!

Chapter
30

<EOS>
Relates
what
Oliver
's
new
visitors
thought
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
With
many
loquacious
assurances
that
they
would
be
agreeably
surprised
in
the
aspect
of
the
criminal
,
the
doctor
drew
the
young
lady
's
arm
through
one
of
him
;
and
offering
his
disengaged
hand
to
Mrs
Maylie
,
led
them
,
with
much
ceremony
and
stateliness
,
upstairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
in
a
whisper
,
as
he
softly
turned
the
handle
of
a
bedroom
-
door
,
"
let
us
hear
what
you
think
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
not
been
shaved
very
recently
,
but
he
do
n't
look
at
all
ferocious
notwithstanding
.
 
<EOS>
Stop
,
though
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
first
see
that
he
is
in
visiting
order
.
"
   
<EOS>
Stepping
before
them
,
he
looked
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Motioning
them
to
advance
,
he
closed
the
door
when
they
had
entered
;
and
gently
drew
back
the
curtains
of
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
it
,
in
lieu
of
the
dogged
,
black
-
visaged
ruffian
they
had
expected
to
behold
,
there
lay
a
mere
child
:
 
worn
with
pain
and
exhaustion
,
and
sunk
into
a
deep
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
His
wounded
arm
,
bound
and
splintered
up
,
was
crossed
upon
his
breast
;
his
head
reclined
upon
the
other
arm
,
which
was
half
hidden
by
his
long
hair
,
as
it
streamed
over
the
pillow
.
   
<EOS>
The
honest
gentleman
held
the
curtain
in
his
hand
,
and
looked
on
,
for
a
minute
or
so
,
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
Whilst
he
was
watching
the
patient
thus
,
the
younger
lady
glided
softly
past
,
and
seating
herself
in
a
chair
by
the
bedside
,
gathered
Oliver
's
hair
from
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
stooped
over
him
,
her
tears
fell
upon
his
forehead
.
   
<EOS>
The
boy
stirred
,
and
smiled
in
his
sleep
,
as
though
these
marks
of
pity
and
compassion
had
awakened
some
pleasant
dream
of
a
love
and
affection
he
had
never
known
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
a
strain
of
gentle
music
,
or
the
rippling
of
water
in
a
silent
place
,
or
the
odour
of
a
flower
,
or
the
mention
of
a
familiar
word
,
will
sometimes
call
up
sudden
dim
remembrances
of
scenes
that
never
were
,
in
this
life
;
which
vanish
like
a
breath
;
which
some
brief
memory
of
a
happier
existence
,
long
gone
by
,
would
seem
to
have
awakened
;
which
no
voluntary
exertion
of
the
mind
can
ever
recall
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
can
this
mean
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
elder
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
poor
child
can
never
have
been
the
pupil
of
robbers
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Vice
,
"
said
the
surgeon
,
replacing
the
curtain
,
"
takes
up
her
abode
in
many
temples
;
and
who
can
say
that
a
fair
outside
shell
not
enshrine
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
at
so
early
an
age
!
"
urged
Rose
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
young
lady
,
"
rejoined
the
surgeon
,
mournfully
shaking
his
head
;
"
crime
,
like
death
,
is
not
confined
to
the
old
and
withered
alone
.
 
<EOS>
The
youngest
and
fairest
are
too
often
its
chosen
victims
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
,
can
you
---
oh
!
can
you
really
believe
that
this
delicate
boy
has
been
the
voluntary
associate
of
the
worst
outcasts
of
society
?
"
said
Rose
.
   
<EOS>
The
surgeon
shook
his
head
,
in
a
manner
which
intimated
that
he
feared
it
was
very
possible
;
and
observing
that
they
might
disturb
the
patient
,
led
the
way
into
an
adjoining
apartment
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
even
if
he
has
been
wicked
,
"
pursued
Rose
,
"
think
how
young
he
is
;
think
that
he
may
never
have
known
a
mother
's
love
,
or
the
comfort
of
a
home
;
that
ill
-
usage
and
blows
,
or
the
want
of
bread
,
may
have
driven
him
to
herd
with
men
who
have
forced
him
to
guilt
.
 
<EOS>
Aunt
,
dear
aunt
,
for
mercy
's
sake
,
think
of
this
,
before
you
let
them
drag
this
sick
child
to
a
prison
,
which
in
any
case
must
be
the
grave
of
all
his
chances
of
amendment
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
as
you
love
me
,
and
know
that
I
have
never
felt
the
want
of
parents
in
your
goodness
and
affection
,
but
that
I
might
have
done
so
,
and
might
have
been
equally
helpless
and
unprotected
with
this
poor
child
,
have
pity
upon
him
before
it
is
too
late
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
love
,
"
said
the
elder
lady
,
as
she
folded
the
weeping
girl
to
her
bosom
,
"
do
you
think
I
would
harm
a
hair
of
his
head
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
!
"
replied
Rose
,
eagerly
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
surely
,
"
said
the
old
lady
;
"
my
days
are
drawing
to
their
close
:
 
and
may
mercy
be
shown
to
me
as
I
show
it
to
others
!
<EOS>
What
can
I
do
to
save
him
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
think
,
ma'am
,
"
said
the
doctor
;
"
let
me
think
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Losberne
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
and
took
several
turns
up
and
down
the
room
;
often
stopping
,
and
balancing
himself
on
his
toes
,
and
frowning
frightfully
.
 
<EOS>
After
various
exclamations
of
"
I
've
got
it
now
"
and
"
no
,
I
have
n't
,
"
and
as
many
renewals
of
the
walking
and
frowning
,
he
at
length
made
a
dead
halt
,
and
spoke
as
follows
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
if
you
give
me
a
full
and
unlimited
commission
to
bully
Giles
,
and
that
little
boy
,
Brittles
,
I
can
manage
it
.
 
<EOS>
Giles
is
a
faithful
fellow
and
an
old
servant
,
I
know
;
but
you
can
make
it
up
to
him
in
a
thousand
ways
,
and
reward
him
for
being
such
a
good
shot
besides
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
object
to
that
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Unless
there
is
some
other
way
of
preserving
the
child
,
"
replied
Mrs
Maylie
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
other
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
other
,
take
my
word
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
my
aunt
invests
you
with
full
power
,
"
said
Rose
,
smiling
through
her
tears
;
"
but
pray
do
n't
be
harder
upon
the
poor
fellows
than
is
indispensably
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
think
,
"
retorted
the
doctor
,
"
that
everybody
is
disposed
to
be
hard
-
hearted
to
-
day
,
except
yourself
,
Miss
Rose
.
<EOS>
I
only
hope
,
for
the
sake
of
the
rising
male
sex
generally
,
that
you
may
be
found
in
as
vulnerable
and
soft
-
hearted
a
mood
by
the
first
eligible
young
fellow
who
appeals
to
your
compassion
;
and
I
wish
I
were
a
young
fellow
,
that
I
might
avail
myself
,
on
the
spot
,
of
such
a
favourable
opportunity
for
doing
so
,
as
the
present
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
as
great
a
boy
as
poor
Brittles
himself
,
"
returned
Rose
,
blushing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
laughing
heartily
,
"
that
is
no
very
difficult
matter
.
 
<EOS>
But
to
return
to
this
boy
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
point
of
our
agreement
is
yet
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
wake
in
an
hour
or
so
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
;
and
although
I
have
told
that
thick
-
headed
constable
-
fellow
downstairs
that
he
musn't
be
moved
or
spoken
to
,
on
peril
of
his
life
,
I
think
we
may
converse
with
him
without
danger
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
make
this
stipulation
---
that
I
shall
examine
him
in
your
presence
,
and
that
,
if
,
from
what
he
says
,
we
judge
,
and
I
can
show
to
the
satisfaction
of
your
cool
reason
,
that
he
is
a
real
and
thorough
bad
one
(
which
is
more
than
possible
)
,
he
shall
be
left
to
his
fate
,
without
any
farther
interference
on
my
part
,
at
all
events
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
aunt
!
<EOS>
"
entreated
Rose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
aunt
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
is
a
bargain
?
;
   
"
He
can
not
be
hardened
in
vice
,
"
said
Rose
;
"
It
is
impossible
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
retorted
the
doctor
;
"
then
so
much
the
more
reason
for
acceding
to
my
proposition
.
"
   
<EOS>
Finally
the
treaty
was
entered
into
;
and
the
parties
thereunto
sat
down
to
wait
,
with
some
impatience
,
until
Oliver
should
awake
.
   
<EOS>
The
patience
of
the
two
ladies
was
destined
to
undergo
a
longer
trial
than
Mr
Losberne
had
led
them
to
expect
;
for
hour
after
hour
passed
on
,
and
still
Oliver
slumbered
heavily
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
evening
,
indeed
,
before
the
kind
-
hearted
doctor
brought
them
the
intelligence
,
that
he
was
at
length
sufficiently
restored
to
be
spoken
to
.
 
<EOS>
The
boy
was
very
ill
,
he
said
,
and
weak
from
the
loss
of
blood
;
but
his
mind
was
so
troubled
with
anxiety
to
disclose
something
,
that
he
deemed
it
better
to
give
him
the
opportunity
,
than
to
insist
upon
his
remaining
quiet
until
next
morning
:
which
he
should
otherwise
have
done
.
   
<EOS>
The
conference
was
a
long
one
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
told
them
all
his
simple
history
,
and
was
often
compelled
to
stop
,
by
pain
and
want
of
strength
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
solemn
thing
,
to
hear
,
in
the
darkened
room
,
the
feeble
voice
of
the
sick
child
recounting
a
weary
catalogue
of
evils
and
calamities
which
hard
men
had
brought
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
when
we
oppress
and
grind
our
fellow
-
creatures
,
we
bestowed
<EOS>
but
one
thought
on
the
dark
evidences
of
human
error
,
which
,
like
dense
and
heavy
clouds
,
are
rising
,
slowly
it
is
true
,
but
not
less
surely
,
to
Heaven
,
to
pour
their
after
-
vengeance
on
our
heads
;
if
we
heard
but
one
instant
,
in
imagination
,
the
deep
testimony
of
dead
men
's
voices
,
which
no
power
can
stifle
,
and
no
pride
shut
out
;
where
would
be
the
injury
and
injustice
,
the
suffering
,
misery
,
cruelty
,
and
wrong
,
that
each
day
's
life
brings
with
it
!
   
<EOS>
Oliver
's
pillow
was
smoothed
by
gentle
hands
that
night
;
and
loveliness
and
virtue
watched
him
as
he
slept
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
calm
and
happy
,
and
could
have
died
without
a
murmur
.
   
<EOS>
The
momentous
interview
was
no
sooner
concluded
,
and
Oliver
composed
to
rest
again
,
than
the
doctor
,
after
wiping
his
eyes
,
and
condemning
them
for
being
weak
all
at
once
,
betook
himself
downstairs
to
open
upon
Mr
Giles
.
 
<EOS>
And
finding
nobody
about
the
parlours
,
it
occurred
to
him
,
that
he
could
perhaps
originate
the
proceedings
with
better
effect
in
the
kitchen
;
so
into
the
kitchen
he
went
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
assembled
,
in
that
lower
house
of
the
domestic
parliament
,
the
women
-
servants
,
Mr
Brittles
,
Mr
Giles
,
the
tinker
(
who
had
received
a
special
invitation
to
regale
himself
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
,
in
consideration
of
his
services
)
,
and
the
constable
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
gentleman
had
a
large
staff
,
a
large
head
,
large
features
,
and
large
half
-
boots
;
and
he
looked
as
if
he
had
been
taking
a
proportionate
allowance
of
ale
---
as
indeed
he
had
.
   
<EOS>
The
adventures
of
the
previous
night
were
still
under
discussion
;
for
Mr
Giles
was
expatiating
upon
his
presence
of
mind
,
when
the
doctor
entered
;
Mr
Brittles
,
with
a
mug
of
ale
in
his
hand
,
was
corroborating
everything
,
before
his
superior
said
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sit
still
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
doctor
,
waving
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
said
Mr
Giles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Misses
wished
some
ale
to
be
given
out
,
sir
;
and
as
I
felt
no
ways
inclined
for
my
own
little
room
,
sir
,
and
was
disposed
for
company
,
I
am
taking
mine
among
'em
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
Brittles
headed
a
low
murmur
,
by
which
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
generally
were
understood
to
express
the
gratification
they
derived
from
Mr
Giles
's
condescension
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Giles
looked
round
with
a
patronising
air
,
as
much
as
to
say
that
so
long
as
they
behaved
properly
,
he
would
never
desert
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
is
the
patient
to
-
night
,
sir
?
"
asked
Giles
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
-
so
"
;
returned
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
you
have
got
yourself
into
a
scrape
there
,
Mr
Giles
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Giles
,
trembling
,
"
that
he
's
going
to
die
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
thought
it
,
I
should
never
be
happy
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
cut
a
boy
off
:
 
no
,
not
even
Brittles
here
;
not
for
all
the
plate
in
the
county
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
the
point
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
mysteriously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Giles
,
are
you
a
Protestant
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
I
hope
so
,
"
faltered
Mr
Giles
,
who
had
turned
very
pale
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
are
YOU
,
boy
?
"
said
the
doctor
,
turning
sharply
upon
Brittles
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
me
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Brittles
,
starting
violently
;
"
I
'm
the
same
as
Mr
Giles
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
tell
me
this
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
"
both
of
you
,
both
of
you
!
<EOS>
Are
you
going
to
take
upon
yourselves
to
swear
,
that
that
boy
upstairs
is
the
boy
that
was
put
through
the
little
window
last
night
?
 
<EOS>
Out
with
it
!
 
<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
We
are
prepared
for
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
doctor
,
who
was
universally
considered
one
of
the
best
-
tempered
creatures
on
earth
,
made
this
demand
in
such
a
dreadful
tone
of
anger
,
that
Giles
and
Brittles
,
who
were
considerably
muddled
by
ale
and
excitement
,
stared
at
each
other
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pay
attention
to
the
reply
,
constable
,
will
you
?
"
said
the
doctor
,
shaking
his
forefinger
with
great
solemnity
of
manner
,
and
tapping
the
bridge
of
his
nose
with
it
,
to
bespeak
the
exercise
of
that
worthy
's
utmost
acuteness
.
<EOS>
"
Something
may
come
of
this
before
long
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
constable
looked
as
wise
as
he
could
,
and
took
up
his
staff
of
office
:
which
had
been
recling
indolently
in
the
chimney
-
corner
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
simple
question
of
identity
,
you
will
observe
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
it
is
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
constable
,
coughing
with
great
violence
;
for
he
had
finished
his
ale
in
a
hurry
,
and
some
of
it
had
gone
the
wrong
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
the
house
broken
into
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
"
and
a
couple
of
men
catch
one
moment
's
glimpse
of
a
boy
,
in
the
midst
of
gunpowder
smoke
,
and
in
all
the
distraction
of
alarm
and
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
<EOS>
a
boy
comes
to
that
very
same
house
,
next
morning
,
and
because
he
happens
to
have
his
arm
tied
up
,
these
men
lay
violent
hands
upon
him
---
by
doing
which
<EOS>
,
they
place
his
life
in
great
danger
---
and
swear
he
is
the
thief
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
the
question
is
,
whether
these
men
are
justified
by
the
fact
;
if
not
,
in
what
situation
do
they
place
themselves
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
constable
nodded
profoundly
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
if
that
was
n't
law
,
he
would
be
glad
to
know
what
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
again
,
"
thundered
the
doctor
,
"
are
you
,
on
your
solemn
oaths
,
able
to
identify
that
boy
?
"
   
<EOS>
Brittles
looked
doubtfully
at
Mr
Giles
;
Mr
Giles
looked
doubtfully
at
Brittles
;
the
constable
put
his
hand
behind
his
ear
,
to
catch
the
reply
;
the
two
women
and
the
tinker
leaned
forward
to
listen
;
the
doctor
glanced
keenly
round
;
when
a
ring
was
heard
at
the
gate
,
and
at
the
same
moment
,
the
sound
of
wheels
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
runners
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Brittles
,
to
all
appearance
much
relieved
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
what
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
doctor
,
aghast
in
his
turn
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
Bow
Street
officers
,
sir
,
"
replied
Brittles
,
taking
up
a
candle
;
"
me
and
Mr
Giles
sent
for
'em
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
cried
the
doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
replied
Brittles
;
"
I
sent
a
message
up
by
the
coachman
,
and
I
only
wonder
they
were
n't
here
before
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
did
,
did
you
?
 
<EOS>
Then
confound
your
---
slow
coaches
down
here
;
that
's
all
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
walking
away
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
31
.
<EOS>
Involves
a
critical
position
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Brittles
,
opening
the
door
a
little
way
,
with
the
chain
up
,
and
peeping
out
,
shading
the
candle
with
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Open
the
door
,
"
replied
a
man
outside
;
"
it
's
the
officers
from
Bow
Street
,
as
was
sent
to
to
-
day
.
"
   
<EOS>
Much
comforted
by
this
assurance
,
Brittles
opened
the
door
to
its
full
width
,
and
confronted
a
portly
man
in
a
great
-
coat
;
who
walked
in
,
without
saying
anything
more
,
and
wiped
his
shoes
on
the
mat
,
as
coolly
as
if
he
lived
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
Just
send
somebody
out
to
relieve
my
mate
,
will
you
,
young
man
?
"
said
the
officer
;
"
he
's
in
the
gig
,
a
-
minding
the
prad
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
got
a
coach
"
us
here
,
that
you
could
put
it
up
in
,
for
five
or
ten
minutes
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Brittles
replying
in
the
affirmative
,
and
pointing
out
the
building
,
the
portly
man
stepped
back
to
the
garden
-
gate
,
and
helped
his
companion
to
put
up
the
gig
:
 
while
Brittles
lighted
them
,
in
a
state
of
great
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
This
done
,
they
returned
to
the
house
,
and
,
being
shown
into
a
parlour
,
took
off
their
great
-
coats
and
hats
,
and
showed
like
what
they
were
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
who
had
knocked
at
the
door
,
was
a
stout
personage
of
middle
height
,
aged
about
fifty
:
with
shiny
black
hair
,
cropped
pretty
close
;
half
-
whiskers
,
a
round
face
,
and
sharp
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
was
a
red
-
headed
,
bony
man
,
in
top
-
boots
;
with
a
rather
ill
-
favoured
countenance
,
and
a
turned
-
up
sinister
-
looking
nose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
your
governor
that
Blathers
and
Duff
is
here
,
will
you
?
"
said
the
stouter
man
,
smoothing
down
his
hair
,
and
laying
a
pair
of
handcuffs
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
Good
-
evening
,
master
.
 
<EOS>
Can
I
have
a
word
or
two
with
you
in
private
,
if
you
please
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
addressed
to
Mr
Losberne
,
who
now
made
his
appearance
;
that
gentleman
,
motioning
Brittles
to
retire
,
brought
in
the
two
ladies
,
and
shut
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
lady
of
the
house
,
"
said
Mr
Losberne
,
motioning
towards
Mrs
Maylie
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Blathers
made
a
bow
.
 
<EOS>
Being
desired
to
sit
down
,
he
put
his
hat
on
the
floor
,
and
taking
a
chair
,
motioned
to
Duff
to
do
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
gentleman
,
who
did
not
appear
quite
so
much
accustomed
to
good
society
,
or
quite
so
much
at
his
ease
in
it
---
one
of
the
two
---
seated
himself
,
after
undergoing
several
muscular
affections
of
the
limbs
,
and
the
head
of
his
stick
into
his
mouth
,
with
some
embarrassment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
with
regard
to
this
here
robbery
,
master
,
"
said
Blathers
.
<EOS>
"
What
are
the
circumstances
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Losberne
,
who
appeared
desirous
of
gaining
time
,
recounted
them
at
great
length
,
and
with
much
circumlocution
.
 
<EOS>
Messrs.
Blathers
and
Duff
looked
very
knowing
meanwhile
,
and
occasionally
exchanged
a
nod
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
,
for
certain
,
till
I
see
the
work
,
of
course
,
"
said
Blathers
;
"
but
my
opinion
at
once
is
,
---
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
committing
myself
to
that
extent
,
---
that
this
was
n't
done
by
a
yokel
;
eh
,
Duff
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Certainly
not
,
"
replied
Duff
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
,
translating
the
word
yokel
for
the
benefit
of
the
ladies
,
I
apprehend
your
meaning
to
be
,
that
this
attempt
was
not
made
by
a
countryman
?
"
said
Mr
Losberne
,
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
,
master
,
"
replied
Blathers
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
all
about
the
robbery
,
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
,
"
replied
the
doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
what
is
this
,
about
this
here
boy
that
the
servants
are
a
-
talking
on
?
"
said
Blathers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
at
all
,
"
replied
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
of
the
frightened
servants
chose
to
take
it
into
his
head
,
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
this
attempt
to
break
into
the
house
;
but
it
's
nonsense
:
sheer
absurdity
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
easy
disposed
of
,
if
it
is
,
"
remarked
Duff
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
he
says
is
quite
correct
,
"
observed
Blathers
,
nodding
his
head
in
a
confirmatory
way
,
and
playing
carelessly
with
the
handcuffs
,
as
if
they
were
a
pair
of
castanets
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
the
boy
?
   
<EOS>
What
account
does
he
give
of
himself
?
 
<EOS>
Where
did
he
come
from
?
<EOS>
He
did
n't
drop
out
of
the
clouds
,
did
he
,
master
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
,
"
replied
the
doctor
,
with
a
nervous
glance
at
the
two
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
his
whole
history
:
but
we
can
talk
about
that
presently
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
like
,
first
,
to
see
the
place
where
the
thieves
made
their
attempt
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Certainly
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Blathers
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
had
better
inspect
the
premises
first
,
and
examine
the
servants
afterwards
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
usual
way
of
doing
business
.
"
   
<EOS>
Lights
were
then
procured
;
and
Messrs.
Blathers
and
Duff
,
attended
by
the
native
constable
,
Brittles
,
Giles
,
and
everybody
else
in
short
,
went
into
the
little
room
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
looked
out
at
the
window
;
and
afterwards
went
round
by
way
of
the
lawn
,
and
looked
in
at
the
window
;
and
after
that
,
had
a
candle
handed
out
to
inspect
the
shutter
with
;
and
after
that
,
a
lantern
to
trace
the
footsteps
with
;
and
after
that
,
a
pitchfork
to
poke
the
bushes
with
.
 
<EOS>
This
done
,
amidst
the
breathless
interest
of
all
beholders
,
they
came
in
again
;
and
Mr
Giles
and
Brittles
were
put
through
a
melodramatic
representation
of
their
share
in
the
previous
night
's
adventures
:
which
they
performed
some
six
times
over
:
contradiction
each
other
,
in
not
more
than
one
important
respect
,
the
first
time
,
and
in
not
more
than
a
dozen
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
This
consummation
being
arrived
at
,
Blathers
and
Duff
cleared
the
room
,
and
held
a
long
council
together
,
compared
with
which
,
for
secrecy
and
solemnity
,
a
consultation
of
great
doctors
on
the
knottiest
point
in
medicine
,
would
be
mere
child
's
play
.
   
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
doctor
walked
up
and
down
the
next
room
in
a
very
uneasy
state
;
and
Mrs
Maylie
and
Rose
looked
on
,
with
anxious
faces
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
"
he
said
,
making
a
halt
,
after
a
great
number
of
very
rapid
turns
,
"
I
hardly
know
what
to
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
"
said
Rose
,
"
the
poor
child
's
story
,
faithfully
repeated
to
these
men
,
will
be
sufficient
to
exonerate
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
it
,
my
dear
young
lady
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
it
would
exonerate
him
,
either
with
them
,
or
with
legal
functionaries
of
a
higher
grade
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
he
,
after
all
,
they
would
say
?
 
<EOS>
A
runaway
.
 
<EOS>
Judged
by
mere
worldly
considerations
and
probabilities
,
his
story
is
a
very
doubtful
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
believe
it
,
surely
?
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Rose
.
   
<EOS>
"
\
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
\
believe
it
,
strange
as
it
is
;
and
perhaps
I
may
be
an
old
fool
for
doing
so
,
"
rejoined
the
doctor
;
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
n't
think
it
is
exactly
the
tale
for
a
practical
police
-
officer
,
nevertheless
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
demanded
Rose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Because
,
my
pretty
cross
-
examiner
,
"
replied
the
doctor
:
"
because
,
viewed
with
their
eyes
,
there
are
many
ugly
points
about
it
;
he
can
only
prove
the
parts
that
look
ill
,
and
none
of
those
that
look
well
.
 
<EOS>
Confound
the
fellows
<EOS>
,
they
WILL
have
the
way
and
the
wherefore
,
and
will
take
nothing
for
granted
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
own
showing
,
you
see
,
he
has
been
the
companion
of
thieves
for
some
time
past
;
he
has
been
carried
to
a
police
-
officer
,
on
a
charge
of
picking
a
gentleman
's
pocket
;
he
has
been
taken
away
,
forcibly
,
from
that
gentleman
's
house
,
to
a
place
which
he
can
not
describe
or
point
out
,
and
of
the
situation
of
which
he
has
not
the
remotest
idea
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
brought
down
to
Chertsey
,
by
men
who
seem
to
have
taken
a
violent
fancy
to
him
,
whether
he
will
or
no
;
and
is
put
through
a
window
to
rob
a
house
;
and
then
,
just
at
the
very
moment
when
he
is
going
to
alarm
the
inmates
,
and
so
do
the
very
thing
that
would
set
him
all
to
rights
,
there
rushes
into
the
way
,
a
blundering
dog
of
a
half
-
bred
butler
,
and
shoots
him
!
<EOS>
As
if
on
purpose
to
prevent
his
doing
any
good
for
himself
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
all
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
,
of
course
,
"
replied
Rose
,
smiling
at
the
doctor
's
impetuosity
;
"
but
still
I
do
not
see
anything
in
it
,
to
criminate
the
poor
child
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
the
doctor
;
"
of
course
not
!
 
<EOS>
Bless
the
bright
eyes
of
your
sex
!
 
<EOS>
They
never
see
,
whether
for
good
or
bad
,
more
than
one
side
of
any
question
;
and
that
is
,
always
,
the
one
which
first
presents
itself
to
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
Having
given
vent
to
this
result
of
experience
,
the
doctor
put
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
even
greater
rapidity
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
more
I
think
of
it
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
"
<EOS>
the
more
I
see
that
it
will
occasion
endless
trouble
and
difficulty
if
we
put
these
men
in
possession
of
the
boy
's
real
story
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
certain
it
will
not
be
believed
;
and
even
if
they
can
do
nothing
to
him
in
the
end
,
still
the
dragging
it
forward
,
and
giving
publicity
to
all
the
doubts
that
will
be
cast
upon
it
,
must
interfere
,
materially
,
with
your
benevolent
plan
of
rescuing
him
from
misery
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
what
is
to
be
done
?
"
cried
Rose
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
!
<EOS>
whyddid
they
send
for
these
people
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Maylie
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
have
had
them
here
,
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
I
know
is
,
"
said
Mr
Losberne
,
at
last
:
 
sitting
down
with
a
kind
of
desperate
calmness
,
"
that
we
must
try
and
carry
it
off
with
a
bold
face
.
 
<EOS>
The
object
is
a
good
one
,
and
that
must
be
our
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
The
boy
has
strong
symptoms
of
fever
upon
him
,
and
is
in
no
condition
to
be
talked
to
any
more
;
that
's
one
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
make
the
best
of
it
;
and
if
bad
be
the
best
,
it
is
no
fault
of
ours
.
 
<EOS>
Come
in
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
master
,
"
said
Blathers
,
entering
the
room
followed
by
his
colleague
,
and
making
the
door
fast
,
before
he
said
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
warn't
a
put
-
up
thing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
the
devil
's
a
put
-
up
thing
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
doctor
,
impatiently
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
call
it
a
put
-
up
robbery
,
ladies
,
"
said
Blathers
,
turning
to
them
,
as
if
he
pitied
their
ignorance
,
but
had
a
contempt
for
the
doctor
's
,
"
when
the
servants
is
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nobody
suspected
them
,
in
this
case
,
"
said
Mrs
Maylie
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
likely
not
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
Blathers
;
"
but
they
might
have
been
in
it
,
for
all
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
More
likely
on
that
wery
account
,
"
said
Duff
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
find
it
was
a
town
hand
,
"
said
Blathers
,
continuing
his
report
;
"
for
the
style
of
work
is
first
-
rate
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wery
pretty
indeed
it
is
,
"
remarked
Duff
,
in
an
undertone
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
was
two
of
'em
in
it
,
"
continued
Blathers
;
"
and
they
had
a
boy
with
'em
;
that
's
plain
from
the
size
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
to
be
said
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
see
this
lad
that
you
've
got
upstairs
at
once
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
they
will
take
something
to
drink
first
,
Mrs
Maylie
?
"
said
the
doctor
:
his
face
brightening
,
as
if
some
new
thought
had
occurred
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
to
be
sure
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Rose
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
it
immediately
,
if
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
thank
you
,
miss
!
"
<EOS>
said
Blathers
,
drawing
his
coat
-
sleeve
across
his
mouth
;
"
it
's
dry
work
,
this
sort
of
duty
.
 
<EOS>
Anythink
<EOS>
that
's
handy
,
miss
;
do
n't
put
yourself
out
of
the
way
,
on
our
accounts
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
shall
it
be
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
doctor
,
following
the
young
lady
to
the
sideboard
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
little
drop
of
spirits
,
master
,
if
it
's
all
the
same
,
"
replied
Blathers
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
cold
ride
from
London
,
ma'am
;
and
I
always
find
that
spirits
comes
home
warmer
to
the
feelings
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
interesting
communication
was
addressed
to
Mrs
Maylie
,
who
received
it
very
graciously
.
 
<EOS>
While
it
was
being
conveyed
to
her
,
the
doctor
slipped
out
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr
Blathers
:
 
not
holding
his
wine
-
glass
by
the
stem
,
but
grasping
the
bottom
between
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
:
and
placing
it
in
front
of
his
chest
;
"
I
have
seen
a
good
many
pieces
of
business
like
this
,
in
my
time
,
ladies
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
crack
down
in
the
back
lane
at
Edmonton
,
Blathers
,
"
said
Mr
Duff
,
assisting
his
colleague
's
memory
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
was
something
in
this
way
,
warn't
it
?
<EOS>
"
rejoined
Mr
Blathers
;
"
that
was
done
by
Conkey
Chickweed
,
that
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
always
gave
that
to
him
"
replied
Duff
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
the
Family
<EOS>
Pet
,
I
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
Conkey
had
n't
any
more
to
do
with
it
than
I
had
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Get
out
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Mr
Blathers
;
"
I
know
better
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
mind
that
time
when
Conkey
was
robbed
of
his
money
,
though
?
 
<EOS>
What
a
start
that
was
!
 
<EOS>
Better
than
any
novel
-
book
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
I
\
ever
see
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
was
that
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Rose
:
 
anxious
to
encourage
any
symptoms
of
good
-
humour
in
the
unwelcome
visitors
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
robbery
,
miss
,
that
hardly
anybody
would
have
been
down
upon
,
"
said
Blathers
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
here
Conkey
Chickweed
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Conkey
means
Nosey
,
ma'am
,
"
interposed
Duff
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
the
lady
knows
that
,
do
n't
she
?
"
demanded
Mr
Blathers
.
 
<EOS>
"
Always
interrupting
,
you
are
,
partner
!
 
<EOS>
This
here
<EOS>
Conkey
Chickweed
,
miss
,
kept
a
public
-
house
over
Battlebridge
way
,
and
he
had
a
cellar
,
where
a
good
many
young
lords
went
to
see
cock
-
fighting
,
and
badger
-
drawing
,
and
that
;
and
a
wery
intellectural
manner
the
sports
was
conducted
in
,
<EOS>
for
I
've
seen
'em
off'en
.
 
<EOS>
He
warn't
one
of
the
family
,
at
that
time
;
and
one
night
he
was
robbed
of
three
hundred
and
twenty
-
seven
guineas
in
a
canvas
bag
,
that
was
stole
out
of
his
bedrrom
in
the
dead
of
night
,
by
a
tall
man
with
a
black
patch
over
his
eye
,
who
had
concealed
himself
under
the
bed
,
and
after
committing
the
robbery
,
jumped
slap
out
of
window
:
 
which
was
only
a
story
high
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
wery
quick
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
Conkey
was
quick
,
too
;
for
he
fired
a
blunderbuss
arter
him
,
and
roused
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
They
set
up
a
hue
-
and
-
cry
,
directly
,
and
when
they
came
to
look
about
'em
,
found
that
Conkey
had
hit
the
robber
;
for
there
was
traces
of
blood
,
all
the
way
to
some
palings
a
good
distance
off
;
and
there
they
lost
'em
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
he
had
made
off
with
the
blunt
;
and
,
consequently
,
the
name
of
Mr
Chickweed
,
licensed
witler
,
appeared
in
the
Gazette
among
the
other
bankrupts
;
and
all
manner
of
benefits
and
subscriptions
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
all
,
was
got
up
for
the
poor
man
,
who
was
in
a
wery
low
state
of
mind
about
his
loss
,
and
went
up
and
down
the
streets
,
for
three
or
four
days
,
a
pulling
his
hair
off
in
such
a
desperate
manner
that
many
people
was
afraid
he
might
be
going
to
make
away
with
himself
.
<EOS>
One
day
he
came
up
to
the
office
,
all
in
a
hurry
,
and
had
a
private
interview
with
the
magistrate
,
who
,
after
a
deal
of
talk
,
rings
the
bell
,
and
orders
Jem
Spyers
in
<EOS>
(
Jem
was
a
active
officer
)
,
and
tells
him
to
go
and
assist
Mr
Chickweed
in
apprehending
the
man
as
robbed
his
house
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
,
Spyers
,
"
said
Chickweed
,
"
pass
my
house
yesterday
morning
,
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
you
up
,
and
collar
him
!
"
says
Spyers
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
so
struck
all
of
a
heap
,
that
you
might
have
fractured
my
skull
with
a
toothpick
,
"
says
the
poor
man
;
"
but
we
're
sure
to
have
him
;
for
between
ten
and
eleven
o'clock
at
night
he
passed
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
Spyers
no
sooner
heard
this
,
than
he
put
some
clean
linen
and
a
comb
,
in
his
pocket
,
in
case
he
should
have
to
stop
a
day
or
two
;
and
away
he
goes
,
and
sets
himself
down
at
one
of
the
public
-
house
windows
behind
the
little
red
curtain
,
with
his
hat
on
,
all
ready
to
bolt
out
,
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
<EOS>
He
was
smoking
his
pipe
here
,
late
at
night
,
when
all
of
a
sudden
Chickweed
roars
out
,
"
Here
he
is
!
<EOS>
Stop
thief
!
 
<EOS>
Murder
!
"
 
<EOS>
Jem
Spyers
dashes
out
;
and
there
he
sees
Chickweed
,
a
-
tearing
down
the
street
full
cry
.
 
<EOS>
Away
goes
Spyers
;
on
goes
Chickweed
;
round
turns
the
people
;
everybody
roars
out
,
"
Thieves
!
"
and
Chickweed
himself
keeps
on
shouting
,
all
the
time
,
like
mad
.
 
<EOS>
Spyers
loses
sight
of
him
a
minute
as
he
turns
a
corner
;
shoots
round
;
sees
a
little
crowd
;
dives
in
;
"
Which
is
the
man
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
D
---
 
me
!
"
says
Chickweed
,
"
I
've
lost
him
again
!
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
remarkable
occurrence
,
but
he
warn't
to
be
seen
nowhere
,
so
they
went
back
to
the
public
-
house
.
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
Spyers
took
his
old
place
,
and
looked
out
,
from
behind
the
curtain
,
for
a
tall
man
with
a
black
patch
over
his
eye
,
till
his
own
two
eyes
ached
again
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
he
could
n't
help
shutting
'em
,
to
ease
'em
a
minute
;
and
the
very
moment
he
did
so
<EOS>
,
he
hears
Chickweed
a
-
roaring
out
,
"
Here
he
is
!
"
 
<EOS>
Off
he
starts
once
more
,
with
Chickweed
half
-
way
down
the
street
ahead
of
him
;
and
after
twice
as
long
a
run
as
the
yesterday
's
one
,
the
man
's
lost
again
!
 
<EOS>
This
was
done
,
once
or
twice
more
,
till
one
-
half
the
neighbours
gave
out
that
Mr
Chickweed
had
been
robbed
by
the
devil
,
who
was
playing
tricks
with
him
arterwards
;
and
the
other
half
,
that
poor
Mr
Chickweed
had
gone
mad
with
grief
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
Jem
Spyers
say
?
"
inquired
the
doctor
;
who
had
returned
to
the
room
shortly
after
the
commencement
of
the
story
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jem
Spyers
,
"
resumed
the
officer
,
"
for
a
long
time
said
nothing
at
all
,
and
listened
to
everything
without
seeming
to
,
which
showed
he
understood
his
business
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
one
morning
,
he
walked
into
the
bar
,
and
taking
out
his
snuffbox
,
says
"
Chickweed
<EOS>
,
I
've
found
out
who
done
this
here
robbery
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
?
"
said
Chickweed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
Spyers
,
only
let
me
have
wengeance
,
and
I
shall
die
contented
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
dear
Spyers
,
where
is
the
villain
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
<EOS>
said
Spyers
,
offering
him
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
"
none
of
that
gammon
!
 
<EOS>
You
did
it
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
he
had
;
and
a
good
bit
of
money
he
had
made
by
it
,
too
;
and
nobody
would
never
have
found
it
out
,
if
he
had
n't
been
so
precious
anxious
to
keep
up
appearances
!
"
said
Mr
Blathers
,
putting
down
his
wine
-
glass
,
and
clinking
the
handcuffs
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
curious
,
indeed
,
"
observed
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
if
you
please
,
you
can
walk
upstairs
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
YOU
please
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Blathers
.
 
<EOS>
Closely
following
Mr
Losberne
,
the
two
officers
ascended
to
Oliver
's
bedroom
;
<EOS>
Mr
Giles
preceding
the
party
,
with
a
lighted
candle
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
had
been
dozing
;
but
looked
worse
,
and
was
more
feverish
than
he
had
appeared
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Being
assisted
by
the
doctor
,
he
managed
to
sit
up
in
bed
for
a
minute
or
so
;
and
looked
at
the
strangers
without
at
all
understanding
what
was
going
forward
---
in
fact
,
without
seeming
to
recollect
where
he
was
,
or
what
had
been
passing
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
said
Mr
Losberne
,
speaking
softly
,
but
with
great
vehemence
notwithstanding
,
"
this
is
the
lad
,
who
,
being
accidentally
wounded
by
a
spring
-
gun
in
some
boyish
trespass
on
Mr
What
-
d'ye
-
call
-
him
's
grounds
,
at
the
back
here
,
comes
to
the
house
for
assistance
this
morning
,
and
is
immediately
laid
hold
of
and
maltreated
,
by
that
ingenious
gentleman
with
the
candle
in
his
hand
:
 
who
has
placed
his
life
in
considerable
danger
,
as
I
can
professionally
certify
.
"
   
<EOS>
Messrs.
Blathers
and
Duff
looked
at
Mr
Giles
,
as
he
was
thus
recommended
to
their
notice
.
 
<EOS>
The
bewildered
butler
gazed
from
them
towards
Oliver
,
and
from
Oliver
towards
Mr
Losberne
,
with
a
most
ludicrous
mixture
of
fear
and
perplexity
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
deny
that
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
doctor
,
laying
Oliver
gently
down
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
all
done
for
the
---
for
the
best
,
sir
,
"
answered
Giles
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
thought
it
was
the
boy
,
or
I
would
n't
have
meddled
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
of
an
inhuman
disposition
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thought
it
was
what
boy
?
"
inquired
the
senior
officer
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
housebreaker
's
boy
,
sir
!
"
replied
Giles
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
---
they
certainly
had
a
boy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
so
now
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Blathers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Think
what
,
now
?
"
<EOS>
replied
Giles
,
looking
vacantly
at
his
questioner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Think
it
's
the
same
boy
,
Stupid
-
head
?
"
rejoined
Blathers
,
impatiently
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
;
I
really
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Giles
,
with
a
rueful
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
swear
to
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
?
"
asked
Mr
Blathers
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
to
think
,
"
replied
poor
Giles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
it
is
the
boy
;
indeed
,
I
'm
almost
certain
that
it
is
n't
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
it
ca
n't
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Has
this
man
been
a
-
drinking
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Blathers
,
turning
to
the
doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
precious
muddle
-
headed
chap
you
are
!
"
said
Duff
,
addressing
Mr
Giles
,
with
supreme
contempt
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Losberne
had
been
feeling
the
patient
's
pulse
during
this
short
dialogue
;
but
he
now
rose
from
the
chair
by
the
bedside
,
and
remarked
,
that
if
the
officers
had
any
doubts
upon
the
subject
,
they
would
perhaps
like
to
step
into
the
next
room
,
and
have
Brittles
before
them
.
   
<EOS>
Acting
upon
this
suggestion
,
they
adjourned
to
a
neighbouring
apartment
,
where
Mr
Brittles
,
being
called
in
,
involved
himself
and
his
respected
superior
in
such
a
wonderful
maze
of
fresh
contradictions
and
impossibilities
,
as
tended
to
throw
no
particular
light
on
anything
,
but
the
fact
of
his
own
strong
mystification
;
except
,
indeed
,
his
declarations
that
he
should
n't
know
the
real
boy
,
if
he
were
put
before
him
that
instant
;
that
he
had
only
taken
Oliver
to
be
he
,
because
Mr
Giles
had
said
he
was
;
and
that
Mr
Giles
had
,
five
minutes
previously
,
admitted
in
the
kitchen
,
that
he
begain
to
be
very
much
afraid
he
had
been
a
little
too
hasty
.
   
<EOS>
Among
other
ingenious
surmises
,
the
question
was
then
raised
,
whether
Mr
Giles
had
really
hit
anybody
;
and
upon
examination
of
the
fellow
pistol
to
that
which
he
had
fired
,
it
turned
out
to
have
no
more
destructive
loading
than
gunpowder
and
brown
paper
:
a
discovery
which
made
a
considerable
impression
on
everybody
but
the
doctor
,
who
had
drawn
the
ball
about
ten
minutes
before
.
<EOS>
Upon
no
one
,
however
,
did
it
make
a
greater
impression
than
on
Mr
Giles
himself
;
who
,
after
labouring
,
for
some
hours
,
under
the
fear
of
having
mortally
wounded
a
fellow
-
creature
,
eagerly
caught
at
this
new
idea
,
and
favoured
it
to
the
utmost
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
the
officers
,
without
troubling
themselves
very
much
about
Oliver
,
left
the
Chertsey
constable
in
the
house
,
and
took
up
their
rest
for
that
night
in
the
town
;
promising
to
return
the
next
morning
.
   
<EOS>
With
the
next
morning
,
there
came
a
rumour
,
that
two
men
and
a
boy
were
in
the
cage
at
Kingston
,
who
had
been
apprehended
over
night
under
suspicious
circumstances
;
and
to
Kingston
Messrs.
Blathers
and
Duff
journeyed
accordingly
.
<EOS>
The
suspicious
circumstances
,
however
,
resolving
themselves
,
on
investigation
,
into
the
one
fact
,
that
they
had
been
discovered
sleeping
under
a
haystack
;
which
,
although
a
great
crime
,
is
only
punishable
by
imprisonment
,
and
is
,
in
the
merciful
eye
of
the
English
law
,
and
its
comprehensive
love
of
all
the
King
's
subjects
,
held
to
be
no
satisfactory
proof
,
in
the
absence
of
all
other
evidence
,
that
the
sleeper
,
or
sleepers
,
have
committed
burglary
accompanied
with
violence
,
and
have
therefore
rendered
themselves
liable
to
the
punishment
of
death
;
Messrs.
Blathers
and
Duff
came
back
again
,
as
wise
as
they
went
.
   
<EOS>
In
short
,
after
some
more
examination
,
and
a
great
deal
more
conversation
,
a
neighbouring
magistrate
was
readily
induced
to
take
the
joint
bail
of
Mrs
Maylie
and
Mr
Losberne
for
Oliver
's
appearance
if
he
should
ever
be
called
upon
;
and
Blathers
and
Duff
,
being
rewarded
with
a
couple
of
guineas
,
returned
to
town
with
divided
opinions
on
the
subject
of
their
expedition
:
<EOS>
the
latter
gentleman
on
a
mature
consideration
of
all
the
circumstances
,
inclining
to
the
belief
that
the
burglarious
attempt
had
originated
with
the
Family
Pet
;
and
the
former
being
equally
disposed
to
concede
the
full
merit
of
it
to
the
great
Mr
Conkey
Chickweed
.
   
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Oliver
gradually
throve
and
prospered
under
the
united
care
of
Mrs
Maylie
,
Rose
,
and
the
kind
-
hearted
Mr
Losberne
.
 
<EOS>
If
fervent
prayers
,
gushing
from
hearts
overcharged
with
gratitude
,
be
heard
in
heaven
---
and
if
they
be
not
,
what
prayers
are
!
<EOS>
---
the
blessings
which
the
orphan
child
called
down
upon
them
,
sunk
into
their
souls
,
diffusing
peace
and
happiness
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
32
.
<EOS>
Of
the
happy
life
Oliver
began
to
lead
with
his
kind
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
's
ailings
were
neither
slight
nor
few
.
 
<EOS>
In
addition
to
the
pain
and
delay
attendant
on
a
broken
limb
,
his
exposure
to
the
wet
and
cold
had
brought
on
fever
and
ague
:
 
which
hung
about
him
for
many
weeks
,
and
reduced
him
sadly
.
<EOS>
But
,
at
length
,
he
began
,
by
slow
degrees
,
to
get
better
,
and
to
be
able
to
say
sometimes
,
<EOS>
in
a
few
tearful
words
,
how
deeply
he
felt
the
goodness
of
the
two
sweet
ladies
,
and
how
ardently
he
hoped
that
when
he
grew
strong
and
well
again
,
he
could
do
something
to
show
his
gratitude
;
only
something
,
which
would
let
them
see
the
love
and
duty
with
which
his
breast
was
full
;
something
,
however
slight
,
which
would
prove
to
them
that
their
gentle
kindness
had
not
been
cast
away
;
but
that
the
poor
boy
whom
their
charity
had
rescued
from
misery
,
or
death
,
was
eager
to
serve
them
with
his
whole
heart
and
soul
.
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
"
said
Rose
,
when
Oliver
had
been
one
day
feebly
endeavouring
to
utter
the
words
of
thankfulness
that
rose
to
his
pale
lips
;
"
you
shall
have
many
opportunities
of
serving
us
,
if
you
will
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
going
into
the
country
,
and
my
aunt
intends
that
you
shall
accompany
us
.
 
<EOS>
The
quiet
place
,
the
pure
air
,
and
all
the
pleasure
and
beauties
of
spring
,
will
restore
you
in
a
few
days
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
employ
you
in
a
hundred
ways
,
when
you
can
bear
the
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
trouble
!
"
cried
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
lady
,
if
I
could
but
work
for
you
;
if
I
could
only
give
you
pleasure
by
watering
your
flowers
,
or
watching
your
birds
,
or
running
up
and
down
the
whole
day
long
,
to
make
you
happy
;
what
would
I
give
to
do
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
give
nothing
at
all
,
"
said
Miss
Maylie
,
smiling
;
"
for
,
as
I
told
you
before
,
we
shall
employ
you
in
a
hundred
ways
;
and
if
you
only
take
half
the
trouble
to
please
us
,
that
you
promise
now
,
you
will
make
me
very
happy
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Happy
,
ma'am
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Oliver
;
"
how
kind
of
you
to
say
so
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
make
me
happier
than
I
can
tell
you
,
"
replied
the
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
think
that
my
dear
good
aunt
should
have
been
the
means
of
rescuing
any
one
from
such
sad
misery
as
you
have
described
to
us
,
would
be
an
unspeakable
pleasure
to
me
;
but
to
know
that
the
object
of
her
goodness
and
compassion
was
sincerely
grateful
and
attached
,
in
consequence
,
would
delight
me
,
more
than
you
can
well
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
me
?
<EOS>
"
she
inquired
,
watching
Oliver
's
thoughtful
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
ma'am
,
yes
!
"
replied
Oliver
eagerly
;
"
but
I
was
thinking
that
I
am
ungrateful
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
To
whom
?
"
inquired
the
young
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
the
kind
gentleman
,
and
the
dear
old
nurse
,
who
took
so
much
care
of
me
before
,
"
rejoined
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
they
knew
how
happy
I
am
,
they
would
be
pleased
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
they
would
,
"
rejoined
Oliver
's
benefactress
;
"
and
Mr
Losberne
has
already
been
kind
enough
to
promise
that
when
you
are
well
enough
to
bear
the
journey
,
he
will
carry
you
to
see
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Has
he
,
ma'am
?
"
cried
Oliver
,
his
face
brightening
with
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
I
shall
do
for
joy
when
I
see
their
kind
faces
once
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
a
short
time
Oliver
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
undergo
the
fatigue
of
this
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
One
morning
he
and
Mr
Losberne
set
out
,
accordingly
,
in
a
little
carriage
which
belonged
to
Mrs
Maylie
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
came
to
Chertsey
Bridge
,
Oliver
turned
very
pale
,
and
uttered
a
loud
exclamation
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
with
the
boy
?
"
cried
the
doctor
,
as
usual
,
all
in
a
bustle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
see
anything
---
hear
anything
---
feel
anything
---
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
,
sir
,
"
cried
Oliver
,
pointing
out
of
the
carriage
window
.
<EOS>
"
That
house
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
well
,
what
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
Stop
coachman
.
 
<EOS>
Pull
up
here
,
"
cried
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
of
the
house
,
my
man
;
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
thieves
---
the
house
they
took
me
to
!
"
whispered
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
devil
it
is
!
"
cried
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hallo
,
there
!
<EOS>
let
me
out
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
,
before
the
coachman
could
dismount
from
his
box
,
he
had
tumbled
out
of
the
coach
,
by
some
means
or
other
;
and
,
running
down
to
the
deserted
tenement
,
began
kicking
at
the
door
like
a
madman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Halloa
?
"
said
a
little
ugly
hump
-
backed
man
:
 
opening
the
door
so
suddenly
,
that
the
doctor
,
from
the
very
impetus
of
his
last
kick
,
nearly
fell
forward
into
the
passage
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
here
?
"
   
"
Matter
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
other
,
collaring
him
,
without
a
moment
's
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
good
deal
.
 
<EOS>
Robbery
is
the
matter
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
'll
be
Murder
the
matter
,
too
,
<EOS>
"
replied
the
hump
-
backed
man
,
coolly
,
"
if
you
do
n't
take
your
hands
off
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
me
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hear
you
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
giving
his
captive
a
hearty
shake
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
's
---
confound
the
fellow
<EOS>
,
what
's
his
rascally
name
---
Sikes
;
that
's
it
.
 
<EOS>
Where
's
Sikes
,
you
thief
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
hump
-
backed
man
stared
,
as
if
in
excess
of
amazement
and
indignation
;
then
,
twisting
himself
,
dexterously
,
from
the
doctor
's
grasp
,
growled
forth
a
volley
of
horrid
oaths
,
and
retired
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Before
he
could
shut
the
door
,
however
,
the
doctor
had
passed
into
the
parlour
,
without
a
word
of
parley
.
   
<EOS>
He
looked
anxiously
round
;
not
an
article
of
furniture
;
not
a
vestige
of
anything
,
animate
or
inanimate
;
not
even
the
position
of
the
cupboards
;
answered
Oliver
's
description
!
   
<EOS>
"
Now
!
"
said
the
hump
-
backed
man
,
who
had
watched
him
keenly
,
"
what
do
you
mean
by
coming
into
my
house
,
in
this
violent
way
?
<EOS>
Do
you
want
to
rob
me
,
or
to
murder
me
?
 
<EOS>
Which
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
know
a
man
come
out
to
do
either
,
in
a
chariot
and
a
pair
,
you
ridiculous
old
vampire
?
"
said
the
irritable
doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
,
then
?
"
demanded
the
hunchback
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
take
yourself
off
,
before
I
do
you
a
mischief
?
 
<EOS>
Curse
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
I
think
proper
,
"
said
Mr
Losberne
,
looking
into
the
other
parlour
;
which
,
like
the
first
,
bore
no
resemblance
whatever
to
Oliver
's
account
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
find
you
out
,
some
day
,
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
?
"
sneered
the
ill
-
favoured
cripple
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
ever
want
me
,
I
'm
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
n't
lived
here
mad
and
all
alone
,
for
five
-
and
-
twenty
years
,
to
be
scared
by
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
pay
for
this
;
you
shall
pay
for
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
so
saying
,
the
mis
-
shapen
little
demon
set
up
a
yell
,
and
danced
upon
the
ground
,
as
if
wild
with
rage
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stupid
enough
,
this
,
"
muttered
the
doctor
to
himself
;
"
the
boy
must
have
made
a
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
Here
!
 
<EOS>
Put
that
in
your
pocket
,
and
shut
yourself
up
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
these
words
he
flung
the
hunchback
a
piece
of
money
,
and
returned
to
the
carriage
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
followed
to
the
chariot
door
,
uttering
the
wildest
imprecations
and
curses
all
the
way
;
but
as
Mr
Losberne
turned
to
speak
to
the
driver
,
he
looked
into
the
carriage
,
and
eyed
Oliver
for
an
instant
with
a
glance
so
sharp
and
fierce
and
at
the
same
time
so
furious
and
vindictive
,
that
,
waking
or
sleeping
,
he
could
not
forget
it
for
months
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
continued
to
utter
the
most
fearful
imprecations
,
until
the
driver
had
resumed
his
seat
;
and
when
they
were
once
more
on
their
way
,
they
could
see
him
some
distance
behind
:
beating
his
feet
upon
the
ground
,
and
tearing
his
hair
,
in
transports
of
real
or
pretended
rage
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
an
ass
!
"
said
the
doctor
,
after
a
long
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
know
that
before
,
Oliver
?
"
   
"
No
,
sir
.
"
   
"
Then
do
n't
forget
it
another
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
An
ass
,
"
said
the
doctor
again
,
after
a
further
silence
of
some
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Even
if
it
had
been
the
right
place
,
and
the
right
fellows
had
been
there
,
what
could
I
have
done
,
single
-
handed
?
<EOS>
And
if
I
had
had
assistance
,
I
see
no
good
that
I
should
have
done
,
except
leading
to
my
own
exposure
,
and
an
unavoidable
statement
of
the
manner
in
which
I
have
hushed
up
this
business
.
<EOS>
That
would
have
served
me
right
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
always
involving
myself
in
some
scrape
or
other
,
by
acting
on
impulse
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
have
done
me
good
.
"
   
<EOS>
Now
,
the
fact
was
that
the
excellent
doctor
had
never
acted
upon
anything
but
impulse
all
through
his
life
,
and
if
was
no
bad
compliment
to
the
nature
of
the
impulses
which
governed
him
,
that
so
far
from
being
involved
in
any
peculiar
troubles
or
misfortunes
,
he
had
the
warmest
respect
and
esteem
of
all
who
knew
him
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
truth
must
be
told
,
he
was
a
little
out
of
temper
,
for
a
minute
or
two
,
at
being
disappointed
in
procuring
corroborative
evidence
of
Oliver
's
story
on
the
very
first
occasion
on
which
he
had
a
chance
of
obtaining
any
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
came
round
again
,
however
;
and
finding
that
Oliver
's
replies
to
his
questions
,
were
still
as
straightforward
and
consistent
,
and
still
delivered
with
as
much
apparent
sincerity
and
truth
,
as
they
had
ever
been
,
he
made
up
his
mind
to
attach
full
credence
to
them
,
from
that
time
forth
.
   
<EOS>
As
Oliver
knew
the
name
of
the
street
in
which
Mr
Brownlow
resided
,
they
were
enabled
to
drive
straight
thither
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
coach
turned
into
it
,
his
heart
beat
so
violently
,
that
he
could
scarcely
draw
his
breath
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
my
boy
,
which
house
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Losberne
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
!
 
That
!
"
replied
Oliver
,
pointing
eagerly
out
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
white
house
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
make
haste
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
make
haste
!
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
I
should
die
:
it
makes
me
tremble
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
!
"
said
the
good
doctor
,
patting
him
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
them
directly
,
and
they
will
be
overjoyed
to
find
you
safe
and
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
so
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
were
so
good
to
me
;
so
very
,
very
good
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
coach
rolled
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
No
<EOS>
;
that
was
the
wrong
house
;
the
next
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
went
on
a
few
paces
,
and
stopped
again
.
<EOS>
Oliver
looked
up
at
the
windows
,
with
tears
of
happy
expectation
coursing
down
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
the
white
house
was
empty
,
and
there
was
a
bill
in
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
Let
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Knock
at
the
next
door
,
"
cried
Mr
Losberne
,
taking
Oliver
's
arm
in
his
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
has
become
of
Mr
Brownlow
,
who
used
to
live
in
the
adjoining
house
,
do
you
know
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
servant
did
not
know
;
but
would
go
and
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
She
presently
returned
,
and
said
,
that
Mr
Brownlow
had
sold
off
his
goods
,
and
gone
to
the
West
Indies
,
six
weeks
before
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
clasped
his
hands
,
and
sank
feebly
backward
.
   
<EOS>
"
Has
his
housekeeper
gone
too
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Losberne
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
"
;
replied
the
servant
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
old
gentleman
,
the
housekeeper
,
and
a
gentleman
who
was
a
friend
of
Mr
Brownlow
's
,
all
went
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
turn
towards
home
again
,
"
said
Mr
Losberne
to
the
driver
;
"
and
do
n't
stop
to
bait
the
horses
,
till
you
get
out
of
this
confounded
London
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
book
-
stall
keeper
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
said
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
way
there
.
 
<EOS>
See
him
,
pray
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
Do
see
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
poor
boy
,
this
is
disappointment
enough
for
one
day
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
enough
for
both
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
go
to
the
book
-
stall
keeper
's
,
we
shall
certainly
find
that
he
is
dead
,
or
has
set
his
house
on
fire
,
or
run
away
.
 
<EOS>
No
;
home
again
straight
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
in
obedience
to
the
doctor
's
impulse
,
home
they
went
.
   
<EOS>
This
bitter
disappointment
caused
Oliver
much
sorrow
and
grief
,
even
in
the
midst
of
his
happiness
;
for
he
had
pleased
himself
,
many
times
during
his
illness
,
with
thinking
of
all
that
Mr
Brownlow
and
Mrs
Bedwin
would
say
to
him
:
and
what
delight
it
would
be
to
tell
them
how
many
long
days
and
nights
he
had
passed
in
reflecting
on
what
they
had
done
for
him
,
and
in
bewailing
his
cruel
separation
from
them
.
<EOS>
The
hope
of
eventually
clearing
himself
with
them
,
too
,
and
explaining
how
he
had
been
forced
away
,
had
buoyed
him
up
,
and
sustained
him
,
under
many
of
his
recent
trials
;
and
now
,
the
idea
that
they
should
have
gone
so
far
,
and
carried
with
them
the
belief
that
the
was
an
impostor
and
a
robber
---
a
belief
which
might
remain
uncontradicted
to
his
dying
day
---
was
almost
more
than
he
could
bear
.
   
<EOS>
The
circumstance
occasioned
no
alteration
,
however
,
in
the
behaviour
of
his
benefactors
.
 
<EOS>
After
another
fortnight
,
when
the
fine
warm
weather
had
fairly
begun
,
and
every
tree
and
flower
was
putting
forth
its
young
leaves
and
rich
blossoms
,
they
made
preparations
for
quitting
the
house
at
Chertsey
,
for
some
months
.
   
<EOS>
Sending
the
plate
,
which
had
so
excited
Fagin
's
cupidity
,
to
the
banker
's
;
and
leaving
Giles
and
another
servant
in
care
of
the
house
,
they
departed
to
a
cottage
at
some
distance
in
the
country
,
and
took
Oliver
with
them
.
   
<EOS>
Who
can
describe
the
pleasure
and
delight
,
the
peace
of
mind
and
soft
tranquillity
,
the
sickly
boy
felt
in
the
balmy
air
,
and
among
the
green
hills
and
rich
woods
,
of
an
inland
village
!
 
<EOS>
Who
can
tell
how
scenes
of
peace
and
quietude
sink
into
the
minds
of
pain
-
worn
dwellers
in
close
and
noisy
places
,
and
carry
their
own
freshness
,
deep
into
their
jaded
hearts
!
 
<EOS>
Men
who
have
lived
in
crowded
,
pent
-
up
streets
,
through
lives
of
toil
,
and
who
have
never
wished
for
change
;
men
,
to
whom
custom
has
indeed
been
second
nature
,
and
who
have
come
almost
to
love
each
brick
and
stone
that
formed
the
narrow
boundaries
of
their
daily
walks
;
even
they
,
with
the
hand
of
death
upon
them
,
have
been
known
to
yearn
at
last
for
one
short
glimpse
of
Nature
's
face
;
and
,
carried
far
from
the
scenes
of
their
old
pains
and
pleasures
,
have
seemed
to
pass
at
once
into
a
new
state
of
being
.
 
<EOS>
Crawling
forth
,
from
day
to
day
,
to
some
green
sunny
spot
,
they
have
had
such
memories
wakened
up
within
them
by
the
sight
of
the
sky
,
and
hill
and
plain
,
and
glistening
water
,
that
a
foretaste
of
heaven
itself
has
soothed
their
quick
decline
,
and
they
have
sunk
into
their
tombs
,
as
peacefully
as
the
sun
whose
setting
they
watched
from
their
lonely
chamber
window
but
a
few
hours
before
,
faded
from
their
dim
and
feeble
sight
!
 
<EOS>
The
memories
which
peaceful
country
scenes
call
up
,
are
not
of
this
world
,
nor
of
its
thoughts
and
hopes
.
 
<EOS>
Their
gentle
influence
may
teach
us
how
to
weave
fresh
garlands
for
the
graves
of
those
we
loved
:
 
may
purify
our
thoughts
,
and
bear
down
before
it
old
enmity
and
hatred
;
but
beneath
all
this
,
there
lingers
,
in
the
least
reflective
mind
,
a
vague
and
half
-
formed
consciousness
of
having
held
such
feelings
long
before
,
in
some
remote
and
distant
time
,
which
calls
up
solemn
thoughts
of
distant
times
to
come
,
and
bends
down
pride
and
worldliness
beneath
it
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
lovely
spot
to
which
they
repaired
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
,
whose
days
had
been
spent
among
squalid
crowds
,
and
in
the
midst
of
noise
and
brawling
,
seemed
to
enter
on
a
new
existence
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
rose
and
honeysuckle
clung
to
the
cottage
walls
;
the
ivy
crept
round
the
trunks
of
the
trees
;
and
the
garden
-
flowers
perfumed
the
air
with
delicious
odours
.
 
<EOS>
Hard
by
,
was
a
little
churchyard
;
not
crowded
with
tall
unsightly
gravestones
,
but
full
of
humble
mounds
,
covered
with
fresh
turf
and
moss
:
beneath
which
,
the
old
people
of
the
village
lay
at
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
often
wandered
here
;
and
,
thinking
of
the
wretched
grave
in
which
his
mother
lay
,
would
sometimes
sit
him
down
and
sob
unseen
;
but
,
when
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
deep
sky
overhead
,
he
would
cease
to
think
of
her
as
lying
in
the
ground
,
and
would
weep
for
her
,
sadly
,
but
without
pain
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
happy
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
days
were
peaceful
and
serene
;
the
nights
brought
with
them
neither
fear
nor
care
;
no
languishing
in
a
wretched
prison
,
or
associating
with
wretched
men
;
nothing
but
pleasant
and
happy
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
Every
morning
he
went
to
a
white
-
headed
old
gentleman
,
who
lived
near
the
little
church
:
who
taught
him
to
read
better
,
and
to
write
:
 
and
who
spoke
so
kindly
,
and
took
such
pains
,
that
Oliver
could
never
try
enough
to
please
him
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
would
walk
with
Mrs
Maylie
and
Rose
,
and
hear
them
talk
of
books
;
or
perhaps
sit
near
them
,
in
some
shady
place
,
and
listen
whilst
the
young
lady
read
:
which
he
could
have
done
,
until
it
grew
too
dark
to
see
the
letters
.
<EOS>
Then
,
he
had
his
own
lesson
for
the
next
day
to
prepare
;
and
at
this
,
he
would
work
hard
,
in
a
little
room
which
looked
into
the
garden
,
till
evening
came
slowly
on
,
when
the
ladies
would
walk
out
again
,
and
he
with
them
:
 
listening
with
such
pleasure
to
all
they
said
:
 
and
so
happy
if
they
wanted
a
flower
that
he
could
climb
to
reach
,
or
had
forgotten
anything
he
could
run
to
fetch
:
that
he
could
never
be
quick
enought
about
it
.
<EOS>
When
it
became
quite
dark
,
and
they
returned
home
,
the
young
lady
would
sit
down
to
the
piano
,
and
play
some
pleasant
air
,
or
sing
,
in
a
low
and
gentle
voice
,
some
old
song
which
it
pleased
her
aunt
to
hear
.
<EOS>
There
would
be
no
candles
lighted
at
such
times
as
these
;
and
Oliver
would
sit
by
one
of
the
windows
,
listening
to
the
sweet
music
,
in
a
perfect
rapture
.
   
<EOS>
And
when
Sunday
came
,
how
differently
the
day
was
spent
,
from
any
way
in
which
he
had
ever
spent
it
yet
!
<EOS>
and
how
happily
too
;
like
all
the
other
days
in
that
most
happy
time
!
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
little
church
,
in
the
morning
,
with
the
green
leaves
fluttering
at
the
windows
:
 
the
birds
singing
without
:
 
and
the
sweet
-
smelling
air
stealing
in
at
the
low
porch
,
and
filling
the
homely
building
with
its
fragrance
.
<EOS>
The
poor
people
were
so
neat
and
clean
,
and
knelt
so
reverently
in
prayer
,
that
it
seemed
a
pleasure
,
not
a
tedious
duty
,
their
assembling
there
together
;
and
though
the
singing
might
be
rude
,
it
was
real
,
and
sounded
more
musical
(
to
Oliver
's
ears
at
least
)
than
any
he
had
ever
heard
in
church
before
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
there
were
the
walks
as
usual
,
and
many
calls
at
the
clean
houses
of
the
labouring
men
;
and
at
night
,
Oliver
read
a
chapter
or
two
from
the
Bible
,
which
he
had
been
studying
all
the
week
,
and
in
the
performance
of
which
duty
he
felt
more
proud
and
pleased
,
than
if
he
had
been
the
clergyman
himself
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
morning
,
Oliver
would
be
a
-
foot
by
six
o'clock
,
roaming
the
fields
,
and
plundering
the
hedges
,
far
and
wide
,
for
nosegays
of
wild
flowers
,
with
which
he
would
return
laden
,
home
;
and
which
it
took
great
care
and
consideration
to
arrange
,
to
the
best
advantage
,
for
the
embellishment
of
the
breakfast
-
table
.
<EOS>
There
was
fresh
groundsel
,
too
,
for
Miss
Maylie
's
birds
,
with
which
Oliver
,
who
had
been
studying
the
subject
under
the
able
tuition
of
the
village
clerk
,
would
decorate
the
cages
,
in
the
most
approved
taste
.
<EOS>
When
the
birds
were
made
all
spruce
and
smart
for
the
day
,
there
was
usually
some
little
commission
of
charity
to
execute
in
the
village
;
or
,
failing
that
,
there
was
rare
cricket
-
playing
,
sometimes
,
on
the
green
;
or
,
failing
that
,
there
was
always
something
to
do
in
the
garden
,
or
about
the
plants
,
to
which
Oliver
(
who
had
studied
this
science
also
,
under
the
same
master
,
who
was
a
gardener
by
trade
,
)
applied
himself
with
hearty
good
-
will
,
until
Miss
Rose
made
her
appearance
:
 
when
there
were
a
thousand
commendations
to
be
bestowed
on
all
he
had
done
.
   
<EOS>
So
three
months
glided
away
;
three
months
which
,
in
the
life
of
the
most
blessed
and
favoured
of
mortals
,
might
have
been
unmingled
happiness
,
and
which
,
in
Oliver
's
were
true
felicity
.
<EOS>
With
the
purest
and
most
amiable
generousity
on
one
side
;
and
the
truest
,
warmest
,
soul
-
felt
gratitude
on
the
other
;
it
is
no
wonder
that
,
by
the
end
of
that
short
time
,
Oliver
Twist
had
become
completely
domesticated
with
the
old
lady
and
her
niece
,
and
that
the
fervent
attachment
of
his
young
and
sensitive
heart
,
was
repaid
by
their
pride
in
,
and
attachment
to
,
himself
.

Chapter
33
.
<EOS>
Wherein
the
happiness
of
Oliver
and
his
friends
,
experiences
a
sudden
check
.
 
<EOS>
Spring
flew
swiftly
by
,
and
summer
came
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
village
had
been
beautiful
at
first
it
was
now
in
the
full
glow
and
luxuriance
of
its
richness
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
trees
,
which
had
looked
shrunken
and
bare
in
the
earlier
months
,
had
now
burst
into
strong
life
and
health
;
and
stretching
forth
their
green
arms
over
the
thirsty
ground
,
converted
open
and
naked
spots
into
choice
nooks
,
where
was
a
deep
and
pleasant
shade
from
which
to
look
upon
the
wide
prospect
,
steeped
in
sunshine
,
which
lay
stretched
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
The
earth
had
donned
her
mantle
of
brightest
green
;
and
shed
her
richest
perfumes
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
prime
and
vigour
of
the
year
;
all
things
were
glad
and
flourishing
.
   
<EOS>
Still
,
the
same
quiet
life
went
on
at
the
little
cottage
,
and
the
same
cheerful
serenity
prevailed
among
its
inmates
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
had
long
since
grown
stout
and
healthy
;
but
health
or
sickness
made
no
difference
in
his
warm
feelings
of
a
great
many
people
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
still
the
same
gentle
,
attached
,
affectionate
creature
that
he
had
been
when
pain
and
suffering
had
wasted
his
strength
,
and
when
he
was
dependent
for
every
slight
attention
,
and
comfort
on
those
who
tended
him
.
   
<EOS>
One
beautiful
night
,
when
they
had
taken
a
longer
walk
than
was
customary
with
them
:
 
for
the
day
had
been
unusually
warm
,
and
there
was
a
brilliant
moon
,
and
a
light
wind
had
sprung
up
,
which
was
unusually
refreshing
.
 
<EOS>
Rose
had
been
in
high
spirits
,
too
,
and
they
had
walked
on
,
in
merry
conversation
,
until
they
had
far
exceeded
their
ordinary
bounds
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Maylie
being
fatigued
,
they
returned
more
slowly
home
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
lady
merely
throwing
off
her
simple
bonnet
,
sat
down
to
the
piano
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
After
running
abstractedly
over
the
keys
for
a
few
minutes
,
she
fell
into
a
low
and
very
solemn
air
;
and
as
she
played
it
,
they
heard
a
sound
as
if
she
were
weeping
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rose
,
my
dear
!
"
said
the
elder
lady
.
   
<EOS>
Rose
made
no
reply
,
but
played
a
little
quicker
,
as
though
the
words
had
roused
her
from
some
painful
thoughts
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rose
,
my
love
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Maylie
,
rising
hastily
,
and
bending
over
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
?
 
<EOS>
In
tears
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
child
,
what
distresses
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
aunt
;
nothing
,
"
replied
the
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
;
I
ca
n't
describe
it
;
but
I
feel
---
"
   
"
Not
ill
,
my
love
?
"
<EOS>
interposed
Mrs
Maylie
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
not
ill
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Rose
:
<EOS>
shuddering
as
though
some
deadly
chillness
were
passing
over
her
,
while
she
spoke
;
"
I
shall
be
better
presently
.
 
<EOS>
Close
the
window
,
pray
!
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
hastened
to
comply
with
her
request
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
lady
,
making
an
effort
to
recover
her
cheerfulness
,
strove
to
play
some
livelier
tune
;
but
her
fingers
dropped
powerless
over
the
keys
.
<EOS>
Covering
her
face
with
her
hands
,
she
sank
upon
a
sofa
,
and
gave
vent
to
the
tears
which
she
was
now
unable
to
repress
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
child
!
"
said
the
elderly
lady
,
folding
her
arms
about
her
,
"
I
never
saw
you
so
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
alarm
you
if
I
could
avoid
it
,
"
rejoined
Rose
;
"
but
indeed
I
have
tried
very
hard
,
and
can
not
help
this
.
<EOS>
I
fear
I
AM
ill
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
,
indeed
;
for
,
when
candles
were
brought
,
they
saw
that
in
the
very
short
time
which
had
elapsed
since
their
return
home
,
the
hue
of
her
countenance
had
changed
to
a
marble
whiteness
.
<EOS>
Its
expression
had
lost
nothing
of
its
beauty
;
but
it
was
changed
;
and
there
was
an
anxious
haggard
look
about
the
gentle
face
,
which
it
had
never
worn
before
.
 
<EOS>
Another
minute
,
and
it
was
suffused
with
<EOS>
a
crimson
flush
:
 
and
a
heavy
wildness
came
over
the
soft
blue
eye
.
 
<EOS>
Again
this
disappeared
,
like
the
shadow
thrown
by
a
passing
cloud
;
and
she
was
once
more
deadly
pale
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
,
who
watched
the
old
lady
anxiously
,
observed
that
she
was
alarmed
by
these
appearances
;
and
so
in
truth
,
was
he
;
but
seeing
that
she
affected
to
make
light
of
them
,
he
endeavoured
to
do
the
same
,
and
they
so
far
succeeded
,
that
when
Rose
was
persuaded
by
her
aunt
to
retire
for
the
night
,
she
was
in
better
spirits
;
and
appeared
even
in
better
health
:
 
assuring
them
that
she
felt
certain
she
should
rise
in
the
morning
,
quite
well
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
said
Oliver
,
when
Mrs
Maylie
returned
,
"
that
nothing
is
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
She
do
n't
look
well
to
-
night
,
but
---
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
lady
motioned
to
him
not
to
speak
;
and
sitting
herself
down
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
room
,
remained
silent
for
some
time
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
,
she
said
,
in
a
trembling
voice
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
very
happy
with
her
for
some
years
:
 
too
happy
,
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
time
that
I
should
meet
with
some
misfortune
;
but
I
hope
it
is
not
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
inquired
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
heavy
blow
,
"
said
the
old
lady
,
"
of
losing
the
dear
girl
who
has
so
long
been
my
comfort
and
happiness
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
God
forbid
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Oliver
,
hastily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Amen
to
that
,
my
child
!
"
said
the
old
lady
,
wringing
her
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
Surely
there
is
no
danger
of
anything
so
dreadful
?
"
said
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Two
hours
ago
,
she
was
quite
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
very
ill
now
,
"
rejoined
Mrs
Maylies
;
"
and
will
be
worse
,
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
,
dear
Rose
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
shall
I
do
without
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
gave
way
to
such
great
grief
,
that
Oliver
,
suppressing
his
own
emotion
,
ventured
to
remonstrate
with
her
;
and
to
beg
,
earnestly
,
that
,
for
the
sake
of
the
dear
young
lady
herself
,
she
would
be
more
calm
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
consider
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Oliver
,
as
the
tears
forced
themselves
into
his
eyes
,
despite
of
his
efforts
to
the
contrary
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
consider
how
young
and
good
<EOS>
she
is
,
and
what
pleasure
and
comfort
she
gives
to
all
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
---
certain
---
<EOS>
quite
certain
---
that
,
for
your
sake
,
who
are
so
good
yourself
;
and
for
her
own
;
and
for
the
sake
of
all
she
makes
so
happy
;
she
will
not
die
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
will
never
let
her
die
so
young
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
said
Mrs
Maylie
,
laying
her
hand
on
Oliver
's
head
.
<EOS>
"
You
think
like
a
child
,
poor
boy
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
teach
me
my
duty
,
notwithstanding
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
forgotten
it
for
a
moment
,
Oliver
,
but
I
hope
I
may
be
pardoned
,
for
I
am
old
,
and
have
seen
enough
of
illness
and
death
to
know
the
agony
of
separation
from
the
objects
of
our
love
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
enough
,
too
,
to
know
that
it
is
not
always
the
youngest
and
best
who
are
spared
to
those
that
love
them
;
but
this
should
give
us
comfort
in
our
sorrow
;
for
Heaven
is
just
;
and
such
things
teach
us
,
impressively
,
that
there
is
a
brighter
world
than
this
;
and
that
the
passage
to
it
is
speedy
.
 
<EOS>
God
's
will
be
done
!
 
<EOS>
I
love
her
;
and
He
know
how
well
!
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
was
surprised
to
see
that
as
Mrs
Maylie
said
these
words
,
she
checked
her
lamentations
as
though
by
one
effort
;
and
drawing
herself
up
as
she
spoke
,
became
composed
and
firm
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
still
more
astonished
to
find
that
this
firmness
lasted
;
and
that
,
under
all
the
care
and
watching
which
ensued
,
Mrs
Maylie
was
every
ready
and
collected
:
performing
all
the
duties
which
had
devolved
upon
her
,
steadily
,
and
,
to
all
external
appearances
,
even
cheerfully
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
young
,
and
did
not
know
what
strong
minds
are
capable
of
,
under
trying
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
How
should
he
,
when
their
possessors
so
seldom
know
themselves
?
   
<EOS>
An
anxious
night
ensued
.
 
<EOS>
When
morning
came
,
Mrs
Maylie
's
predictions
were
but
too
well
verified
.
 
<EOS>
Rose
was
in
the
first
stage
of
a
high
and
dangerous
fever
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
must
be
active
,
Oliver
,
and
not
give
way
to
useless
grief
,
"
said
Mrs
Maylie
,
laying
her
finger
on
her
lip
,
as
she
looked
steadily
into
his
face
;
"
this
letter
must
be
sent
,
with
all
possible
expedition
,
to
Mr
Losberne
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
carried
to
the
market
-
town
:
which
is
not
more
than
four
miles
off
,
by
the
footpath
across
the
field
:
 
and
thence
dispatched
,
by
an
express
on
horseback
,
straight
to
Chertsey
.
<EOS>
The
people
at
the
inn
will
undertake
to
do
this
:
and
I
can
trust
to
you
to
see
it
done
,
I
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
could
make
no
reply
,
but
looked
his
anxiety
to
be
gone
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
is
another
letter
,
"
said
Mrs
Maylie
,
pausing
to
reflect
;
"
but
whether
to
send
it
now
,
or
wait
until
I
see
how
Rose
goes
on
,
I
scarcely
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
forward
it
,
unless
I
feared
the
worst
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
for
Chertsey
,
too
,
ma'am
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Oliver
;
impatient
to
execute
his
commission
,
and
holding
out
his
trembling
hand
for
the
letter
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
the
old
lady
,
giving
it
to
him
mechanically
.
<EOS>
Oliver
glanced
at
it
,
and
saw
that
it
was
directed
to
Harry
Maylie
,
Esquire
,
at
some
great
lord
's
house
in
the
country
;
where
,
he
could
not
make
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
it
go
,
ma'am
?
"
asked
Oliver
,
looking
up
,
impatiently
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
"
replied
Mrs
Maylie
,
taking
it
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
wait
until
to
-
morrow
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
she
gave
Oliver
her
purse
,
and
he
started
off
,
without
more
delay
,
at
the
greatest
speed
he
could
muster
.
   
<EOS>
Swiftly
he
ran
across
the
fields
,
and
down
the
little
lanes
which
sometimes
divided
them
:
<EOS>
now
almost
hidden
by
the
high
corn
on
either
side
,
and
now
emerging
on
an
open
field
,
where
the
mowers
and
haymakers
were
busy
at
their
work
:
 
nor
did
he
stop
once
,
save
now
and
then
,
for
a
few
seconds
,
to
recover
breath
,
until
he
came
,
in
a
great
heat
,
and
covered
with
dust
,
on
the
little
market
-
place
of
the
market
-
town
.
   
<EOS>
Here
he
paused
,
and
looked
about
for
the
inn
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
a
white
bank
,
and
a
red
brewery
,
and
a
yellow
town
-
hall
;
and
in
one
corner
there
was
a
large
house
,
with
all
the
wood
about
it
painted
green
:
 
before
which
was
the
sign
of
"
The
George
.
"
 
<EOS>
To
this
he
hastened
,
as
soon
as
it
caught
his
eye
.
   
<EOS>
He
spoke
to
a
postboy
who
was
dozing
under
the
gateway
;
and
who
,
after
hearing
what
he
wanted
,
referred
him
to
the
ostler
;
who
after
hearing
all
he
had
to
say
again
,
referred
him
to
the
landlord
;
who
was
a
tall
gentleman
in
a
blue
neckcloth
,
a
white
hat
,
drab
breeches
,
and
boots
with
tops
to
match
,
leaning
against
a
pump
by
the
stable
-
door
,
picking
his
teeth
with
a
silver
toothpick
.
   
<EOS>
This
gentleman
walked
with
much
deliberation
into
the
bar
to
make
out
the
bill
:
 
which
took
a
long
time
making
out
:
 
and
after
it
was
ready
,
and
paid
,
a
horse
had
to
be
saddled
,
and
a
man
to
be
dressed
,
which
took
up
ten
good
minutes
more
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Oliver
was
in
such
a
desperate
state
of
impatience
and
anxiety
,
that
he
felt
as
if
he
could
have
jumped
upon
the
horse
himself
,
and
galloped
away
,
full
tear
,
to
the
next
stage
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
all
was
ready
;
and
the
little
parcel
having
been
handed
up
,
with
many
injunctions
and
entreaties
for
its
speedy
delivery
,
the
man
set
spurs
to
his
horse
,
and
rattling
over
the
uneven
paving
of
the
market
-
place
,
was
out
of
the
town
,
and
galloping
along
the
turnpike
-
road
,
in
a
couple
of
minutes
.
   
<EOS>
As
it
was
something
to
feel
certain
that
assistance
was
sent
for
,
and
that
no
time
had
been
lost
,
Oliver
hurried
up
the
inn
-
yard
,
with
a
somewhat
lighter
heart
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
turning
out
of
the
gateway
when
he
accidentally
stumbled
against
a
tall
man
wrapped
in
a
cloak
,
who
was
at
that
moment
coming
out
of
the
inn
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hah
!
"
cried
the
man
,
fixing
his
eyes
on
Oliver
,
and
suddenly
recoiling
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
's
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
said
Oliver
;
"
I
was
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
home
,
and
did
n't
see
you
were
coming
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Death
!
<EOS>
"
muttered
the
man
to
himself
,
glaring
at
the
boy
with
his
large
dark
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
would
have
thought
it
!
<EOS>
Grind
him
to
ashes
!
   
<EOS>
He
'd
start
up
from
a
stone
coffin
,
to
come
in
my
way
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
,
"
stammered
Oliver
,
confused
by
the
strange
man
's
wild
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
have
not
hurt
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Rot
you
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
the
man
,
in
a
horrible
passion
;
between
his
clenched
teeth
;
"
if
I
had
only
had
the
courage
to
say
the
word
,
I
might
have
been
free
of
you
in
a
night
.
 
<EOS>
Curses
on
your
head
,
and
black
death
on
your
heart
,
you
imp
!
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
doing
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
man
shook
his
fist
,
as
he
uttered
these
words
incoherently
.
<EOS>
He
advanced
towards
Oliver
,
as
if
with
the
intention
of
aiming
a
blow
at
him
,
but
fell
violently
on
the
ground
:
 
writhing
and
foaming
,
in
a
fit
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
gazed
,
for
a
moment
,
at
the
struggles
of
the
madman
<EOS>
(
for
such
he
supposed
him
to
be
)
;
and
then
darted
into
the
house
for
help
.
 
<EOS>
Having
seen
him
safely
carried
into
the
hotel
,
he
turned
his
face
homewards
,
running
as
fast
as
he
could
,
to
make
up
for
lost
time
:
 
and
recalling
with
a
great
deal
of
astonishment
and
some
fear
,
the
extraordinary
behaviour
of
the
person
from
whom
he
had
just
parted
.
   
<EOS>
The
circumstance
did
not
dwell
in
his
recollection
long
,
however
:
   
for
when
he
reached
the
cottage
,
there
was
enough
to
occupy
his
mind
,
and
to
drive
all
considerations
of
self
completely
from
his
memory
.
   
<EOS>
Rose
Maylie
had
rapidly
grown
worse
;
before
mid
-
night
she
was
delirious
.
 
<EOS>
A
medical
practitioner
,
who
resided
on
the
spot
,
was
in
constant
attendance
upon
her
;
and
after
first
seeing
the
patient
,
he
had
taken
Mrs
Maylie
aside
,
and
pronounced
her
disorder
to
be
one
of
a
most
alarming
nature
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
fact
,
"
he
said
,
"
it
would
be
little
short
of
a
miracle
,
if
she
recovered
.
"
   
<EOS>
How
often
did
Oliver
start
from
his
bed
that
night
,
and
stealing
out
,
with
noiseless
footstep
,
to
the
staircase
,
listen
for
the
slightest
sound
from
the
sick
chamber
!
 
<EOS>
How
often
did
a
tremble
shake
his
frame
,
and
cold
drops
of
terror
start
upon
his
brow
,
when
a
sudden
trampling
of
feet
caused
him
to
fear
that
something
too
dreadful
to
think
of
,
had
even
then
occurred
!
 
<EOS>
And
what
had
been
the
fervency
of
all
the
prayers
he
had
ever
muttered
,
compared
with
those
he
poured
forth
,
now
,
in
the
agony
and
passion
of
his
supplication
for
the
life
and
health
of
the
gentle
creature
,
who
was
tottering
on
the
deep
grave
's
verge
!
   
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
the
suspense
,
the
fearful
,
acute
suspense
,
of
standing
idly
by
while
the
life
of
one
we
dearly
love
,
is
trembling
in
the
balance
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
the
racking
thoughts
that
crowd
upon
the
mind
,
and
<EOS>
make
the
heart
beat
violently
,
and
the
breath
come
thick
,
by
the
force
of
the
images
they
conjure
up
before
it
;
the
DESPERATE
ANXIETY
TO
BE
DOING
SOMETHING
to
relieve
the
pain
,
or
lessen
the
danger
,
which
we
have
no
power
to
alleviate
;
the
sinking
of
soul
and
spirit
,
which
the
sad
remembrance
of
our
helplessness
produces
;
what
tortures
can
equal
these
;
what
reflections
or
endeavours
can
,
in
the
full
tide
and
fever
of
the
time
,
allay
them
!
   
<EOS>
Morning
came
;
and
the
little
cottage
was
lonely
and
still
.
<EOS>
People
spoke
in
whispers
;
anxious
faces
appeared
at
the
gate
,
from
time
to
time
;
women
and
children
went
away
in
tears
.
<EOS>
All
the
livelong
day
,
and
for
hours
after
it
had
grown
dark
,
Oliver
paced
softly
up
and
down
the
garden
,
raising
his
eyes
every
instant
to
the
sick
chamber
,
and
shuddering
to
see
the
darkened
window
,
looking
as
if
death
lay
stretched
inside
.
 
<EOS>
Late
that
night
,
Mr
Losberne
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
hard
,
"
said
the
good
doctor
,
turning
away
as
he
spoke
;
"
so
young
;
so
much
beloved
;
but
there
is
very
little
hope
.
"
   
<EOS>
Another
morning
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
shone
brightly
;
as
brightly
as
if
it
looked
upon
no
misery
or
care
;
and
,
with
every
leaf
and
flower
in
full
bloom
about
her
;
with
life
,
and
health
,
and
sounds
and
sights
of
joy
,
surrounding
her
on
every
side
:
the
fair
young
creature
lay
,
wasting
fast
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
crept
away
to
the
old
churchyard
,
and
sitting
down
on
one
of
the
green
mounds
,
wept
and
prayed
for
her
,
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
such
peace
and
beauty
in
the
scene
;
so
much
of
brightness
and
mirth
in
the
sunny
landscape
;
such
blithesome
music
in
the
songs
of
the
summer
birds
;
such
freedom
in
the
rapid
flight
of
the
rook
,
careering
overhead
;
so
much
of
life
and
joyousness
in
all
;
that
,
when
the
boy
raised
his
aching
eyes
,
and
looked
about
,
the
thought
instinctively
occurred
to
him
,
that
this
was
not
a
time
for
death
;
that
Rose
could
surely
never
die
when
humbler
<EOS>
things
were
all
so
glad
and
gay
;
that
graves
were
for
cold
and
cheerless
winter
:
 
not
for
sunlight
and
fragrance
.
<EOS>
He
almost
thought
that
shrouds
were
for
the
old
and
shrunken
;
and
that
they
never
wrapped
the
young
and
graceful
form
in
their
ghastly
folds
.
   
<EOS>
A
knell
from
the
church
bell
broke
harshly
on
these
youthful
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
Another
!
 
<EOS>
Again
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
tolling
for
the
funeral
service
.
 
<EOS>
A
group
of
humble
mourners
entered
the
gate
:
wearing
white
favours
;
for
the
corpse
was
young
.
 
<EOS>
They
stood
uncovered
by
a
grave
;
and
there
was
a
mother
---
a
mother
once
---
among
the
weeping
train
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
sun
shone
brightly
,
and
the
birds
sang
on
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
turned
homeward
,
thinking
on
the
many
kindnesses
he
had
received
from
the
young
lady
,
and
wishing
that
the
time
could
come
again
,
that
he
might
never
cease
showing
her
how
grateful
and
attached
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
cause
for
self
-
reproach
on
the
score
of
neglect
,
or
want
of
thought
,
for
he
had
been
devoted
to
her
service
;
and
<EOS>
yet
a
hundred
little
occasions
rose
up
before
him
,
on
which
he
fancied
he
might
have
been
more
zealous
,
and
more
earnest
,
and
wished
he
had
been
.
 
<EOS>
We
need
be
careful
how
we
deal
with
those
about
us
,
when
every
death
carries
to
some
small
circle
of
survivors
,
thoughts
of
so
much
omitted
,
and
so
little
done
---
of
so
many
things
forgotten
,
and
so
many
more
which
might
have
been
repaired
!
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
remorse
so
deep
as
that
<EOS>
which
is
unavailing
;
if
we
would
be
spared
its
tortures
,
let
us
remember
this
,
in
time
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
reached
home
<EOS>
Mrs
Maylie
was
sitting
in
the
little
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
's
heart
sand
at
sight
of
her
;
for
she
had
never
left
the
bedside
of
her
niece
;
and
he
trembled
to
think
what
change
could
have
driven
her
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
learnt
that
she
had
fallen
into
a
deep
sleep
,
from
which
she
would
waken
,
either
to
recovery
and
life
,
or
to
bid
them
farewell
,
and
die
.
   
<EOS>
They
sat
,
listening
,
and
afraid
to
speak
,
for
hours
.
 
<EOS>
The
untasted
meal
was
removed
,
with
looks
which
showed
that
their
thoughts
were
elsewhere
,
they
watched
the
sun
as
he
sank
lower
and
lower
,
and
,
at
length
,
cast
over
sky
and
earth
those
brilliant
hues
which
herald
his
departure
.
 
<EOS>
Their
quick
ears
caught
the
sound
of
an
approaching
footstep
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
involuntarily
darted
to
the
door
,
as
Mr
Losberne
entered
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
of
Rose
?
"
cried
the
old
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
at
once
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
bear
it
;
anything
but
suspense
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
,
tell
me
!
<EOS>
in
the
name
of
Heaven
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
compose
yourself
,
"
said
the
doctor
supporting
her
.
"
<EOS>
Be
calm
,
my
dear
ma'am
,
pray
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
,
in
God
's
name
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
child
!
 
<EOS>
She
is
dead
!
<EOS>
She
is
dying
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
cried
the
doctor
,
passionately
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
He
is
good
and
merciful
,
she
will
live
to
bless
us
all
,
for
years
to
come
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
lady
fell
upon
her
knees
,
and
tried
to
fold
her
hands
together
;
but
the
energy
which
had
supported
her
so
long
,
fled
up
to
Heaven
with
her
first
thanksgiving
;
and
she
sank
into
the
friendly
arms
which
were
extended
to
receive
her
.

particulars

a
young

upon

which
happened
to
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
almost
too
much
happiness
to
bear
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
felt
stunned
and
stupefied
by
the
unexpected
intelligence
;
he
could
not
weep
,
or
speak
,
or
rest
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
the
power
of
understanding
anything
that
had
passed
,
until
,
after
a
long
ramble
in
the
quiet
evening
air
,
a
burst
of
tears
came
to
his
relief
,
and
he
seemed
to
awaken
,
all
at
once
,
to
a
full
sense
of
the
joyful
change
that
had
occurred
,
and
the
almost
insupportable
load
of
anguish
which
had
been
taken
from
his
breast
.
   
<EOS>
The
night
was
fast
closing
in
,
when
he
returned
homeward
:
 
<EOS>
laden
with
flowers
which
he
had
culled
,
with
peculiar
care
,
for
the
adornment
of
the
sick
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
walked
briskly
along
the
road
,
he
heard
behind
him
,
the
noise
of
some
vehicle
,
approaching
at
a
furious
pace
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
round
,
he
saw
that
it
was
a
post
-
chaise
,
driven
at
great
speed
;
and
as
the
horses
were
galloping
,
and
the
road
was
narrow
,
he
stood
leaning
against
a
gate
until
it
should
have
passed
him
.
   
<EOS>
As
it
dashed
on
,
Oliver
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
man
in
a
white
nitecap
,
whose
face
seemed
familiar
to
him
,
although
his
view
was
so
brief
that
he
could
not
identify
the
person
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
second
or
two
,
the
nightcap
was
thrust
out
of
the
chaise
-
window
,
and
a
stentorian
voice
bellowed
to
the
driver
to
stop
:
 
<EOS>
which
he
did
,
as
soon
as
he
could
pull
up
his
horses
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
nightcap
once
again
appeared
:
and
the
same
voice
called
Oliver
by
his
name
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
!
"
cried
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oliver
,
what
's
the
news
?
 
<EOS>
Miss
Rose
!
<EOS>
Master
O
-
li
-
ver
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
is
you
,
Giles
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Oliver
,
running
up
to
the
chaise
-
door
.
   
<EOS>
Giles
popped
out
his
nightcap
again
,
preparatory
to
making
some
reply
,
when
he
was
suddenly
pulled
back
by
a
young
gentleman
who
occupied
the
other
corner
of
the
chaise
,
and
who
eagerly
demanded
what
was
the
news
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
a
word
!
"
cried
the
gentleman
,
"
Better
or
worse
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Better
---
much
better
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Oliver
,
hastily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
sure
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
change
took
place
only
a
few
hours
ago
;
and
Mr
Losberne
says
,
that
all
danger
is
at
an
end
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
said
not
another
word
,
but
,
opening
the
chaise
-
door
,
leaped
out
,
and
taking
Oliver
hurriedly
by
the
arm
,
led
him
aside
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
certain
?
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
possibility
of
any
mistake
on
your
part
,
my
boy
,
is
there
?
"
demanded
the
gentleman
in
a
tremulous
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
deceive
me
,
by
awakening
hopes
that
are
not
to
be
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
for
the
world
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
you
may
believe
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Losberne
's
words
were
,
that
she
would
live
to
bless
us
all
for
many
years
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
him
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
tears
stood
in
Oliver
's
eyes
as
he
recalled
the
scene
which
was
the
beginning
of
so
much
happiness
;
and
the
gentleman
turned
his
face
away
,
and
remained
silent
,
for
some
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
thought
he
heard
him
sob
,
more
than
once
;
but
he
feared
to
interrupt
him
by
any
fresh
remark
---
for
he
could
well
guess
what
his
feelings
were
---
and
so
stood
apart
,
feigning
to
be
occupied
with
his
nosegay
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
Mr
Giles
,
with
the
white
nightcap
on
,
had
been
sitting
on
the
steps
of
the
chaise
,
supporting
an
elbow
on
each
knee
,
and
wiping
his
eyes
with
a
blue
cotton
pocket
-
handkerchief
<EOS>
dotted
with
white
spots
.
 
<EOS>
That
the
honest
fellow
had
not
been
feigning
emotion
,
was
abundently
demonstrated
by
the
very
red
eyes
with
which
he
regarded
the
young
gentleman
,
when
he
turned
round
and
addressed
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
had
better
go
on
to
my
mother
's
in
the
chaise
,
Giles
,
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
walk
slowly
on
,
so
as
to
gain
a
little
time
before
I
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
say
I
am
coming
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr
Harry
,
"
said
Giles
:
 
giving
a
final
polish
to
his
ruffled
countenance
with
the
handkerchief
;
"
but
if
you
would
leave
the
postboy
to
say
that
,
I
should
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
n't
be
proper
for
the
maids
to
see
me
in
this
state
,
sir
;
I
should
never
have
any
more
authority
with
them
if
they
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
rejoined
Harry
Maylie
,
smiling
,
"
you
can
do
as
you
like
.
<EOS>
Let
him
go
on
with
the
luggage
,
if
you
wish
it
,
and
do
you
follow
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
Only
first
exchange
that
nightcap
for
some
more
appropriate
covering
,
or
we
shall
be
taken
for
madmen
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Giles
,
reminded
of
his
unbecoming
costume
,
snatched
off
and
pocketed
his
nightcap
;
and
substituted
a
hat
,
of
grave
and
sober
shape
,
which
he
took
out
of
the
chaise
.
 
<EOS>
This
done
,
the
postboy
drove
off
;
Giles
,
Mr
Maylie
,
and
Oliver
,
followed
at
their
leisure
.
   
<EOS>
As
they
walked
along
,
Oliver
glanced
from
time
to
time
with
much
interest
and
curiosity
at
the
new
comer
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
about
five
-
and
-
twenty
years
of
age
,
and
was
of
the
middle
height
;
his
countenance
was
frank
and
handsome
;
and
his
demeanor
easy
and
prepossessing
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
difference
between
youth
and
age
,
he
bore
so
strong
a
likeness
to
the
old
lady
,
that
Oliver
would
have
had
no
great
difficulty
in
imagining
their
relationship
,
if
he
had
not
already
spoken
of
her
as
his
mother
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Maylie
was
anxiously
waiting
to
receive
her
son
when
he
reached
the
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
The
meeting
did
not
take
place
without
great
emotion
on
both
sides
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
"
whispered
the
young
man
;
"
why
did
you
not
write
before
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
"
replied
Mrs
Maylie
;
"
but
,
on
reflection
,
I
determined
to
keep
back
the
letter
until
I
had
heard
Mr
Losberne
's
opinion
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
why
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
"
why
run
the
chance
of
that
occurring
which
so
nearly
happened
?
 
<EOS>
If
Rose
had
---
I
can
not
utter
that
word
now
---
if
this
illness
had
terminated
differently
,
how
could
you
ever
have
forgiven
yourself
!
 
<EOS>
How
could
I
ever
have
know
happiness
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
that
HAD
been
the
case
,
Harry
,
"
said
Mrs
Maylie
,
"
<EOS>
I
fear
your
happiness
would
have
been
effectually
blighted
,
and
that
your
arrival
here
,
a
day
sooner
or
a
day
later
,
would
have
been
of
very
,
very
little
import
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
who
can
wonder
if
it
be
so
,
mother
?
<EOS>
"
rejoined
the
young
man
;
"
or
why
should
I
say
,
IF
?
---
<EOS>
It
is
---
<EOS>
it
is
---
you
know
it
,
<EOS>
mother
---
you
must
know
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
she
deserves
the
best
and
purest
love
the
heart
of
man
can
offer
,
"
said
Mrs
Maylie
;
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
the
devotion
and
affection
of
her
nature
require
no
ordinary
return
,
but
one
that
shall
be
deep
and
lasting
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
did
not
feel
this
,
and
know
,
besides
,
that
a
changed
behaviour
in
one
she
loved
would
break
her
heart
,
I
should
not
feel
my
task
so
difficult
of
performance
,
or
have
to
encounter
so
many
struggles
in
my
own
bosom
,
when
I
take
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
strict
line
of
duty
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
unkind
,
mother
,
"
said
Harry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
still
suppose
that
I
am
a
boy
ignorant
of
my
own
mind
,
and
mistaking
the
impulses
of
my
own
soul
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
my
dear
son
,
"
returned
Mrs
Maylie
,
laying
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
"
<EOS>
that
youth
has
many
generous
impulses
which
do
not
last
;
and
that
among
them
are
some
,
which
,
being
gratified
,
become
only
the
more
fleeting
.
 
<EOS>
Above
all
,
I
think
"
said
the
lady
,
fixing
her
eyes
on
her
son
's
face
,
"
that
if
an
enthusiastic
,
ardent
,
and
ambitious
man
marry
a
wife
on
whose
name
there
is
a
stain
,
which
,
though
it
originate
in
no
fault
of
hers
,
may
be
visited
by
cold
and
sordid
people
upon
her
,
and
upon
his
children
also
:
and
,
in
exact
proportion
to
his
success
in
the
world
,
be
cast
in
his
teeth
,
and
made
the
subject
of
sneers
against
him
:
 
he
may
,
no
matter
how
generous
and
good
his
nature
,
one
day
repent
of
the
connection
he
formed
in
early
life
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
may
have
the
pain
of
knowing
that
he
does
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
impatiently
,
"
he
would
be
a
selfish
brute
,
unworthy
alike
of
the
name
of
man
and
of
the
woman
you
describe
,
who
acted
thus
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
think
so
now
,
Harry
,
"
replied
his
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
ever
will
!
"
said
the
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
mental
agony
I
have
suffered
,
during
the
last
two
days
,
wrings
from
me
the
avowal
to
you
of
a
passion
which
,
as
you
well
know
,
is
not
one
of
yesterday
,
nor
one
I
have
lightly
formed
.
 
<EOS>
On
Rose
,
sweet
,
gentle
girl
!
<EOS>
my
heart
is
set
,
as
firmly
as
ever
heart
of
man
was
set
on
woman
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
thought
,
<EOS>
no
view
,
no
hope
in
life
,
beyond
her
;
and
if
you
oppose
me
in
this
great
stake
,
you
take
my
peace
and
happiness
in
your
hands
,
and
cast
them
to
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
Mother
,
think
better
of
this
,
and
of
me
,
and
do
not
disregard
the
happiness
of
which
you
seem
to
think
so
little
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Harry
,
"
said
Mrs
Maylie
,
"
it
is
because
I
think
so
much
of
warm
and
sensitive
hearts
,
that
I
would
spare
them
from
being
wounded
.
   
<EOS>
But
we
have
said
enough
,
and
more
than
enough
,
on
this
matter
,
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
it
rest
with
Rose
,
then
,
"
interposed
Harry
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
press
these
overstrained
opinions
of
yours
,
so
far
,
as
to
throw
any
obstacle
in
my
way
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
,
"
rejoined
Mrs
Maylie
;
"
but
I
would
have
you
consider
---
"
   
"
I
HAVE
considered
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
impatient
reply
;
"
Mother
,
I
have
considered
,
years
and
years
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
considered
,
ever
since
I
have
been
capable
of
serious
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
My
feelings
remain
unchanged
,
as
they
ever
will
;
and
why
should
I
suffer
the
pain
of
a
delay
in
giving
them
vent
,
which
can
be
productive
of
no
earthly
good
?
 
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
Before
I
leave
this
place
,
Rose
shall
hear
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
shall
,
"
said
Mrs
Maylie
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
something
in
your
manner
,
which
would
almost
imply
that
she
will
hear
me
coldly
,
mother
,
"
said
the
young
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
coldly
,
"
rejoined
the
old
lady
;
"
far
from
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
then
?
"
urged
the
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
formed
no
other
attachment
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
"
replied
his
mother
;
"
you
have
,
or
I
mistake
,
too
strong
a
hold
on
her
affections
already
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
would
say
,
"
resumed
the
old
lady
,
stopping
her
son
as
he
was
about
to
speak
,
"
is
this
.
 
<EOS>
Before
you
stake
your
all
on
this
chance
;
before
you
suffer
yourself
to
be
carried
to
the
highest
point
of
hope
;
reflect
for
a
few
moments
,
my
dear
child
,
on
Rose
's
history
,
and
consider
what
effect
the
knowledge
of
her
doubtful
birth
may
have
on
her
decision
:
 
devoted
as
she
is
to
us
,
with
all
the
intensity
of
her
noble
mind
,
and
with
that
perfect
sacrifice
of
self
which
,
in
all
matters
,
great
or
trifling
,
has
always
been
her
characteristic
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
I
leave
you
to
discover
,
"
replied
Mrs
Maylie
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
back
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
see
you
again
to
-
night
?
"
said
the
young
man
,
eagerly
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
and
by
,
"
replied
the
lady
;
"
when
I
leave
Rose
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
tell
her
I
am
here
?
"
said
Harry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
replied
Mrs
Maylie
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
say
how
anxious
I
have
been
,
and
how
much
I
have
suffered
,
and
how
I
long
to
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
refuse
to
do
this
,
mother

"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
old
lady
;
"
I
will
tell
her
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
pressing
her
son
's
hand
,
affectionately
,
she
hastened
from
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Losberne
and
Oliver
had
remained
at
another
end
of
the
apartment
while
this
hurried
conversation
was
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
The
former
now
held
out
his
hand
to
Harry
Maylie
;
and
hearty
salutations
were
exchanged
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
doctor
then
communicated
,
in
reply
to
multifarious
questions
from
his
young
friend
,
a
precise
account
of
his
patient
's
situation
;
which
was
quite
as
consolatory
and
full
of
promise
,
as
Oliver
's
statement
had
encouraged
him
to
hope
;
and
to
the
whole
of
which
,
Mr
Giles
,
who
affected
to
be
busy
about
the
luggage
,
listened
with
greedy
ears
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
shot
anything
particular
,
lately
,
Giles
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
doctor
,
when
he
had
concluded
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
particular
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Giles
,
colouring
up
to
the
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nor
catching
any
thieves
,
nor
identifying
any
house
-
breakers
?
"
said
the
doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
None
at
all
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Giles
,
with
much
gravity
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
"
I
am
sorry
to
hear
it
,
because
you
do
that
sort
of
thing
admirably
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
how
is
Brittles
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
boy
is
very
well
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Giles
,
recovering
his
usual
tone
of
patronage
;
"
and
sends
his
respectful
duty
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
well
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Seeing
you
here
,
reminds
me
,
Mr
Giles
,
that
on
the
day
before
that
on
which
I
was
called
away
so
hurriedly
,
I
executed
,
at
the
request
of
your
good
mistress
,
a
small
commission
in
your
favour
.
 
<EOS>
Just
step
into
this
corner
a
moment
,
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Giles
walked
into
the
corner
with
much
importance
,
and
some
wonder
,
and
was
honoured
with
a
short
whispering
conference
with
the
doctor
,
on
the
termination
of
which
,
he
made
a
great
many
bows
,
and
retired
with
steps
of
unusual
stateliness
.
 
<EOS>
The
subject
matter
of
this
conference
was
not
disclosed
in
the
parlour
,
but
the
kitchen
was
speedily
enlightened
concerning
it
;
for
Mr
Giles
walked
straight
thither
,
and
having
called
for
a
mug
of
ale
,
announced
,
with
an
air
of
majesty
,
which
was
highly
effective
,
that
it
had
pleased
his
mistress
,
in
consideration
of
his
gallant
behaviour
on
the
occasion
of
that
attempted
robbery
,
to
depost
,
in
the
local
savings
-
bank
,
the
sum
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
pounds
,
for
his
sole
use
and
benefit
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
,
the
two
women
-
servants
lifted
up
their
hands
and
eyes
,
and
supposed
that
Mr
Giles
,
pulling
out
his
shirt
-
frill
,
replied
,
"
No
,
no
"
;
and
that
if
they
observed
that
he
was
at
all
haughty
to
his
inferiors
,
he
would
thank
them
to
tell
him
so
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
he
made
a
great
many
other
remarks
,
no
less
illustrative
of
his
humility
,
which
were
received
with
equal
favour
and
applause
,
and
were
,
withal
,
as
original
and
as
much
to
the
purpose
,
as
the
remarks
of
great
men
commonly
are
.
   
<EOS>
Above
stairs
,
the
remainder
of
the
evening
passed
cheerfully
away
;
for
the
doctor
was
in
high
spirits
;
and
however
fatigued
or
thoughtful
<EOS>
Harry
Maylie
might
have
been
at
first
,
he
was
not
proof
against
the
worthy
gentleman
's
good
humour
,
which
displayed
itself
in
a
great
variety
of
sallies
and
professional
recollections
,
and
an
abundance
of
small
jokes
,
which
struck
Oliver
as
being
the
drollest
things
he
had
ever
heard
,
and
caused
him
to
laugh
proportionately
;
to
the
evident
satisfaction
of
the
doctor
,
who
laughed
immoderately
at
himself
,
and
made
Harry
laugh
almost
as
heartily
,
by
the
very
force
of
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
they
were
as
pleasant
a
party
as
,
under
the
circumstances
,
they
could
well
have
been
;
and
it
was
late
before
they
retired
,
with
light
and
thankful
hearts
,
to
take
that
rest
of
which
,
after
the
doubt
and
suspense
they
had
recently
undergone
,
they
stood
much
in
need
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
rose
next
morning
,
in
better
heart
,
and
went
about
his
usual
occupations
,
with
more
hope
and
pleasure
than
he
had
known
for
many
days
.
 
<EOS>
The
birds
were
once
more
hung
out
,
to
sing
,
in
their
old
places
;
and
the
sweetest
wild
flowers
that
could
be
found
,
were
once
more
gathered
to
gladden
Rose
with
their
beauty
.
<EOS>
The
melancholy
which
had
seemed
to
the
sad
eyes
of
the
anxious
boy
to
hang
,
for
days
past
,
over
every
object
,
beautiful
as
all
were
,
was
dispelled
by
magic
.
 
<EOS>
The
dew
seemed
to
sparkle
more
brightly
on
the
green
leaves
;
the
air
to
rustle
among
them
with
a
sweeter
music
;
and
the
sky
itself
to
look
more
blue
and
bright
.
<EOS>
Such
is
the
influence
which
the
condition
of
our
own
thoughts
,
exercise
,
even
over
the
appearance
of
external
objects
.
 
<EOS>
Men
who
look
on
nature
,
and
their
fellow
-
men
,
and
cry
that
all
is
dark
and
gloomy
,
are
in
the
right
;
but
the
sombre
colours
are
reflections
from
their
own
jaundiced
eyes
and
hearts
.
 
<EOS>
The
real
hues
are
delicate
,
and
need
a
clearer
vision
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
worthy
of
remark
,
and
Oliver
did
not
fail
to
note
it
at
the
time
,
that
his
morning
expeditions
were
no
longer
made
alone
.
<EOS>
Harry
Maylie
,
after
the
very
first
morning
when
he
met
Oliver
coming
laden
home
,
was
seized
with
such
a
passion
for
flowers
,
and
displayed
such
a
taste
in
their
arrangement
,
as
left
his
young
companion
far
behind
.
 
<EOS>
If
Oliver
were
behindhand
in
these
respects
,
he
knew
where
the
best
were
to
be
found
;
and
morning
after
morning
they
scoured
the
country
together
,
and
brought
home
the
fairest
that
blossomed
.
 
<EOS>
The
window
of
the
young
lady
's
chamber
was
opened
now
;
for
she
loved
to
feel
the
rich
summer
air
stream
in
,
and
revive
her
with
its
freshness
;
but
there
always
stood
in
water
,
just
inside
the
lattice
,
one
particular
little
bunch
,
which
was
made
up
with
great
care
,
every
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
could
not
help
noticing
that
the
withered
flowers
were
never
thrown
away
,
although
the
little
vase
was
regularly
replenished
;
nor
,
could
he
help
observing
,
that
whenever
the
doctor
came
into
the
garden
,
he
invariably
cast
his
eyes
up
to
that
particular
corner
,
and
nodded
his
head
most
expressively
,
as
he
set
forth
on
his
morning
's
walk
.
 
<EOS>
Pending
these
observations
,
the
days
were
flying
by
;
and
Rose
was
rapidly
recovering
.
   
<EOS>
Nor
did
Oliver
's
time
hang
heavy
on
his
hands
,
although
the
young
lady
had
not
yet
left
her
chamber
,
and
there
were
no
evening
walks
,
save
now
and
then
,
for
a
short
distance
,
with
Mrs
Maylie
.
   
<EOS>
He
applied
himself
,
with
redoubled
assiduity
,
to
the
instructions
of
the
white
-
headed
old
gentleman
,
and
laboured
so
hard
that
his
quick
progress
surprised
even
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
while
he
was
engaged
in
this
pursuit
,
that
he
was
greatly
startled
and
distressed
by
a
most
unexpected
occurence
.
   
<EOS>
The
little
room
in
which
he
was
accustomed
to
sit
,
when
busy
at
his
books
,
was
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
a
cottage
-
room
,
with
a
lattice
-
window
:
around
which
were
clusters
of
jessamine
and
honeysuckle
,
that
crept
over
the
casement
,
and
filled
the
place
with
their
delicious
perfume
.
 
<EOS>
It
looked
into
a
garden
,
whence
a
wicket
-
gate
opened
into
a
small
paddock
;
all
beyond
,
was
fine
meadow
-
land
and
wood
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
other
dwelling
near
,
in
that
direction
;
and
the
prospect
it
commanded
was
very
extensive
.
   
<EOS>
One
beautiful
evening
,
when
the
first
shades
of
twilight
were
beginning
to
settle
upon
the
earth
,
Oliver
sat
at
this
window
,
intent
upon
his
books
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
poring
over
them
for
some
time
;
and
,
as
the
day
had
been
uncommonly
sultry
,
and
he
had
exerted
himself
a
great
deal
,
<EOS>
it
it
<EOS>
no
disparagement
to
the
authors
<EOS>
,
whoever
they
may
have
been
,
to
say
,
that
gradually
and
by
slow
degrees
,
he
fell
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
a
kind
of
sleep
that
steals
upon
us
sometimes
,
which
,
while
it
holds
the
body
prisoner
,
does
not
free
the
mind
from
a
sense
of
things
about
it
,
and
enable
it
to
ramble
at
its
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
So
far
as
an
overpowering
heaviness
,
a
prostration
of
strength
,
and
an
utter
inability
to
control
our
thoughts
or
power
of
motion
,
can
be
called
sleep
,
this
is
it
;
and
yet
,
we
have
a
consciousness
of
all
that
is
going
on
about
us
,
and
,
if
we
dream
at
such
a
time
,
<EOS>
words
which
are
really
spoken
,
or
sounds
which
really
exist
at
the
moment
,
accommodate
themselves
with
surprising
readiness
to
our
visions
,
until
reality
and
imagination
become
so
strangely
blended
that
it
is
afterwards
almost
matter
of
impossibility
to
separate
the
two
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
is
this
,
the
most
striking
phenomenon
indcidental
to
such
a
state
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
an
undoubted
fact
,
that
although
our
senses
of
touch
and
sight
be
for
the
time
dead
,
yet
our
sleeping
thoughts
,
and
the
visionary
scenes
that
pass
before
us
,
will
be
influenced
and
materially
influenced
,
by
the
MERE
SILENT
PRESENCE
of
some
external
object
;
which
may
not
have
been
near
us
when
we
closed
our
eyes
:
 
and
of
whose
vicinity
we
have
had
no
waking
consciousness
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
knew
,
perfectly
well
,
that
he
was
in
his
own
little
room
;
that
his
books
were
lying
on
the
table
before
him
;
that
the
sweet
air
was
stirring
among
the
creeping
plants
outside
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
he
was
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
the
scene
changed
;
the
air
became
close
and
confined
;
and
he
thought
,
with
a
glow
of
terror
,
that
he
was
in
the
Jew
's
house
again
.
<EOS>
There
sat
the
hideous
old
man
,
in
his
accustomed
corner
,
pointing
at
him
,
and
whispering
to
another
man
,
with
his
face
averted
,
who
sat
beside
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
he
thought
he
heard
the
Jew
say
;
"
it
is
he
,
sure
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Come
away
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
!
"
<EOS>
the
other
man
seemed
to
answer
;
"
could
I
mistake
him
,
think
you
?
 
<EOS>
If
a
crowd
of
ghosts
were
to
put
themselves
into
his
exact
shape
,
and
he
stood
amongst
them
,
there
is
something
that
would
tell
me
how
to
point
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
buried
him
fifty
feet
deep
,
and
took
me
across
his
grave
,
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
should
know
,
if
there
was
n't
a
mark
above
it
,
that
he
lay
buried
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
man
seemed
to
say
this
,
with
such
dreadful
hatred
,
that
Oliver
awoke
with
the
fear
,
and
started
up
.
   
<EOS>
Good
Heaven
!
 
<EOS>
what
was
that
,
which
sent
the
blood
tingling
to
his
heart
,
and
deprived
him
of
his
voice
,
and
of
power
to
move
!
<EOS>
There
---
there
---
at
the
window
---
close
before
him
---
so
close
,
that
he
could
have
almost
touched
him
before
he
started
back
:
 
with
his
eyes
peering
into
the
room
,
and
meeting
his
:
 
there
stood
the
Jew
!
 
<EOS>
And
beside
him
,
white
with
rage
or
fear
,
or
both
,
were
the
scowling
features
of
the
man
who
had
accosted
him
in
the
inn
-
yard
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
but
an
instant
,
a
glance
,
a
flash
,
before
his
eyes
;
and
they
were
gone
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
had
recognised
him
,
and
he
them
;
and
their
look
was
as
firmly
impressed
upon
his
memory
,
as
if
it
had
been
deeply
carved
in
stone
,
and
set
before
him
from
his
birth
.
<EOS>
He
stood
transfixed
for
a
moment
;
then
,
leaping
from
the
window
into
the
garden
,
called
loudly
for
help
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
35
.
<EOS>
Containing
the
unsatisfactory
result
of
Oliver
's
adventure
;
and
a
conversation
of
some
importance
between
harry
maylie
and
rose
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
inmates
of
the
house
,
attracted
by
Oliver
's
cries
,
hurried
to
the
spot
from
which
they
proceeded
,
they
found
him
,
pale
and
agitated
,
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
meadows
behind
the
house
,
and
scarcely
able
to
articulate
the
words
,
"
The
Jew
!
<EOS>
the
Jew
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Giles
was
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
what
this
outcry
meant
;
but
Harry
Maylie
,
whose
perceptions
were
something
quicker
,
and
who
had
heard
Oliver
's
history
from
his
mother
,
understood
it
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
direction
did
he
take
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
catching
up
a
heavy
stick
which
was
standing
in
a
corner
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
,
"
replied
Oliver
,
pointing
out
the
course
the
man
had
taken
;
"
I
missed
them
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
they
are
in
the
ditch
!
"
said
Harry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Follow
!
 
<EOS>
And
keep
as
near
me
,
as
you
can
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
sprang
over
the
hedge
,
and
darted
off
with
a
speed
which
rendered
it
matter
of
exceeding
difficulty
for
the
others
to
keep
near
him
.
   
<EOS>
Giles
followed
as
well
as
he
could
;
and
Oliver
followed
too
;
and
in
the
course
of
a
minute
or
two
,
Mr
Losberne
,
who
had
been
out
walking
,
and
just
then
returned
,
tumbled
over
the
hedge
after
them
,
and
picking
himself
up
with
more
agility
than
he
could
have
been
supposed
to
possess
,
struck
into
the
same
course
at
no
contemptible
speed
,
shouting
all
the
while
,
most
prodigiously
,
to
know
what
was
the
matter
.
   
<EOS>
On
they
all
went
;
nor
stopped
they
once
to
breathe
,
until
the
leader
,
striking
off
into
an
angle
of
the
field
indicated
by
Oliver
,
began
to
search
,
narrowly
,
the
ditch
and
hedge
adjoining
;
which
afforded
time
for
the
remainder
of
the
party
to
come
up
;
and
for
Oliver
to
communicate
to
Mr
Losberne
the
circumstances
that
had
led
to
so
vigorous
a
pursuit
.
   
<EOS>
The
search
was
all
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
not
even
the
traces
of
recent
footsteps
,
to
be
seen
.
 
<EOS>
They
stood
now
,
on
the
summit
of
a
little
hill
,
commanding
the
open
fields
in
every
direction
for
three
or
four
miles
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
village
in
the
hollow
on
the
left
;
but
,
in
order
to
gain
that
,
after
pursuing
the
track
Oliver
had
pointed
out
,
the
men
must
have
made
a
circuit
of
open
ground
,
which
it
was
impossible
they
could
have
accomplished
in
so
short
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
A
thick
wood
skirted
the
meadow
-
land
in
another
direction
;
but
they
could
not
have
gained
that
covert
for
the
same
reason
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
must
have
been
a
dream
,
Oliver
,
"
said
Harry
Maylie
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
indeed
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
,
shuddering
at
the
very
recollection
of
the
old
wretch
's
countenance
;
"
I
saw
him
too
plainly
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
them
both
,
as
plainly
as
I
see
you
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
was
the
other
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Harry
and
Mr
Losberne
,
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
very
same
man
I
told
you
of
,
who
came
so
suddenly
upon
me
at
the
inn
,
"
said
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
had
our
eyes
fixed
full
upon
each
other
;
and
I
could
swear
to
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
took
this
way
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Harry
:
 
"
are
you
sure
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
I
am
that
the
men
were
at
the
window
,
"
replied
Oliver
,
pointing
down
,
as
he
spoke
,
to
the
hedge
which
divided
the
cottage
-
garden
from
the
meadow
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
tall
man
leaped
over
,
just
there
;
and
the
Jew
,
running
a
few
paces
to
the
right
,
crept
through
that
gap
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
two
gentlemen
watched
Oliver
's
earnest
face
,
as
he
spoke
,
and
looking
from
him
to
each
other
,
seemed
to
fell
satisfied
of
the
accuracy
of
what
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
in
no
direction
were
there
any
appearances
of
the
trampling
of
men
in
hurried
flight
.
 
<EOS>
The
grass
was
long
;
but
it
was
trodden
down
nowhere
,
save
where
their
own
feet
had
crushed
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
sides
and
brinks
of
the
ditches
were
of
damp
clay
;
but
in
no
one
place
could
they
discern
the
print
of
men
's
shoes
,
or
the
slightest
mark
which
would
indicate
that
any
feet
had
pressed
the
ground
for
hours
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
strange
!
"
said
Harry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Strange
?
"
echoed
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Blathers
and
Duff
,
themselves
,
could
make
nothing
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
evidently
useless
nature
of
their
search
,
they
did
not
desist
until
the
coming
on
of
night
rendered
its
further
prosecution
hopeless
;
and
even
then
,
they
gave
it
up
with
reluctance
.
 
<EOS>
Giles
was
dispatched
to
the
different
ale
-
houses
in
the
village
,
furnished
with
the
best
description
Oliver
could
give
of
the
appearance
and
dress
of
the
strangers
.
 
<EOS>
Of
these
,
the
Jew
was
,
at
all
events
,
sufficiently
remarkable
to
be
remembered
,
supposing
he
had
been
seen
drinking
,
or
loitering
about
;
but
Giles
returned
without
any
intelligence
,
calculated
to
dispel
or
lessen
the
mystery
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
next
day
,
fresh
search
was
made
,
and
the
inquiries
renewed
;
but
with
no
better
success
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
day
following
,
Oliver
and
Mr
Maylie
repaired
to
the
market
-
town
,
in
the
hope
of
seeing
or
hearing
something
of
the
men
there
;
but
this
effort
was
equally
fruitless
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
few
days
,
the
affair
began
to
be
forgotten
,
as
most
affairs
are
,
when
wonder
,
having
no
fresh
food
to
support
it
,
dies
away
of
itself
.
   
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Rose
was
rapidly
recovering
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
left
her
room
:
was
able
to
go
out
;
and
mixing
once
more
with
the
family
,
carried
joy
into
the
hearts
of
all
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
although
this
happy
change
had
a
visible
effect
on
the
little
circle
;
and
although
cheerful
voices
and
merry
laughter
were
once
more
heard
in
the
cottage
;
there
was
at
times
,
an
unwonted
restraint
upon
some
there
:
 
even
upon
Rose
herself
:
which
Oliver
could
not
fail
to
remark
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Maylie
and
her
son
were
often
closeted
together
for
a
long
time
;
and
more
than
once
Rose
appeared
with
traces
of
tears
upon
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
After
Mr
Losberne
had
fixed
a
day
for
his
departure
to
Chertsey
,
these
symptoms
increased
;
and
it
became
evident
that
something
was
in
progress
which
affected
the
peace
of
the
young
lady
,
and
of
somebody
else
besides
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
,
one
morning
,
when
Rose
was
alone
in
the
breakfast
-
parlour
,
Harry
Maylie
entered
;
and
,
with
some
hesitation
,
begged
permission
to
speak
with
her
for
a
few
moments
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
few
---
a
very
few
---
will
suffice
,
Rose
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
drawing
his
chair
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
I
shall
have
to
say
,
has
already
presented
itself
to
your
mind
;
the
most
cherished
hopes
of
my
heart
are
not
unknown
to
you
,
though
from
my
lips
you
have
not
heard
them
stated
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rose
had
been
very
pale
from
the
moment
of
his
entrance
;
but
that
might
have
been
the
effect
of
her
recent
illness
.
 
<EOS>
She
merely
bowed
;
and
bending
over
some
plants
that
stood
near
,
waited
in
silence
for
him
to
proceed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
---
ought
to
have
left
here
,
before
,
"
said
Harry
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
should
,
indeed
,
"
replied
Rose
.
 
<EOS>
"
Forgive
me
for
saying
so
,
but
I
wish
you
had
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
brought
here
,
by
the
most
dreadful
and
agonising
of
all
apprehensions
,
"
said
the
young
man
;
"
the
fear
of
losing
the
one
dear
being
on
whom
my
every
wish
and
hope
are
fixed
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
been
dying
;
trembling
between
earth
and
heaven
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
that
when
the
young
,
the
beautiful
,
and
good
,
are
visited
with
sickness
,
their
pure
spirits
insensibly
turn
towards
their
bright
home
of
lasting
rest
;
we
know
,
Heaven
help
us
!
<EOS>
that
the
best
and
fairest
of
our
kind
,
too
often
fade
in
blooming
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
were
tears
in
the
eyes
of
the
gentle
girl
,
as
these
words
were
spoken
;
and
when
one
fell
upon
the
flower
over
which
she
bent
,
and
glistened
brightly
in
its
cup
,
making
it
more
beautiful
,
it
seemed
as
though
the
outpouring
of
her
fresh
young
heart
,
claimed
kindred
naturally
,
with
the
loveliest
things
in
nature
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
creature
,
"
continued
the
young
man
,
passionately
,
"
a
creature
as
fair
and
innocent
of
guile
as
one
of
God
's
own
angels
,
fluttered
between
life
and
death
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
who
could
hope
,
when
the
distant
world
to
which
she
was
akin
,
half
opened
to
her
view
,
that
she
would
return
to
the
sorrow
and
calamity
of
this
!
 
<EOS>
Rose
,
Rose
,
to
know
that
you
were
passing
away
like
some
soft
shadow
,
which
a
light
from
above
,
casts
upon
the
earth
;
to
have
no
hope
that
you
would
be
spared
to
those
who
linger
here
;
hardly
to
know
a
reason
why
you
should
be
;
to
feel
that
you
belonged
to
that
bright
sphere
whither
so
many
of
the
fairest
and
the
best
have
winged
their
early
flight
;
and
yet
to
pray
,
amid
all
these
consolations
,
that
you
might
be
restored
to
those
who
loved
you
---
these
were
distractions
almost
too
great
to
bear
.
<EOS>
They
were
mine
,
by
day
and
night
;
and
with
them
,
came
such
a
rushing
torrent
of
fears
,
and
apprehensions
,
and
selfish
regrets
,
lest
you
should
die
,
and
never
know
how
devotedly
I
loved
you
,
as
almost
bore
down
sense
and
reason
in
its
course
.
 
<EOS>
You
recovered
.
<EOS>
Day
by
day
,
and
almost
hour
by
hour
,
some
drop
of
health
came
back
,
and
mingling
with
the
spent
and
feeble
stream
of
life
which
circulated
languidly
within
you
,
swelled
it
again
to
a
high
and
rushing
tide
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
watched
you
change
almost
from
death
,
to
life
,
with
eyes
that
turned
blind
with
their
eagerness
and
deep
affection
.
<EOS>
Do
not
tell
me
that
you
wish
I
had
lost
this
;
for
it
has
softened
my
heart
to
all
mankind
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
mean
that
,
"
said
Rose
,
weeping
;
"
I
only
wish
you
had
left
here
,
that
you
might
have
turned
to
high
and
noble
pursuits
again
;
to
pursuits
well
worthy
of
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
pursuit
more
worthy
of
me
:
 
more
worthy
of
the
highest
nature
that
exists
:
 
than
the
struggle
to
win
such
a
heart
as
yours
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
taking
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Rose
,
my
own
dear
Rose
!
 
<EOS>
For
years
---
for
years
---
I
have
loved
you
;
hoping
to
win
my
way
to
fame
,
and
then
come
proudly
home
and
tell
you
it
had
been
pursued
only
for
you
to
share
;
thinking
,
in
my
daydreams
,
how
I
would
remind
you
,
in
that
happy
moment
,
of
the
many
silent
tokens
I
had
given
of
a
boy
's
attachment
,
and
claim
your
hand
,
as
in
redemption
of
some
old
mute
contract
that
had
been
sealed
between
us
!
 
<EOS>
That
time
has
not
arrived
;
but
here
,
with
not
fame
won
,
and
no
young
vision
realised
<EOS>
,
I
offer
you
the
heart
so
long
your
own
,
and
stake
my
all
upon
the
words
with
which
you
greet
the
offer
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
behaviour
has
ever
been
kind
and
noble
.
"
<EOS>
said
Rose
,
mastering
the
emotions
by
which
she
was
agitated
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
you
believe
that
I
am
not
insensible
or
ungrateful
,
so
hear
my
answer
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
that
I
may
endeavour
to
deserve
you
;
it
is
,
dear
Rose
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
Rose
,
"
that
you
must
endeavour
to
forget
me
;
not
as
your
old
and
dearly
-
attached
companion
,
for
that
would
wound
me
deeply
;
but
,
as
the
object
of
your
love
.
 
<EOS>
Look
into
the
world
;
think
how
many
hearts
you
would
be
proud
to
gain
,
are
there
.
<EOS>
Confide
some
other
passion
to
me
,
if
you
will
;
I
will
be
the
truest
,
warmest
,
and
most
faithful
friend
you
have
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
,
during
which
,
Rose
,
who
had
covered
her
face
with
one
hand
,
gave
free
vent
to
her
tears
.
 
<EOS>
Harry
still
retained
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
your
reasons
,
Rose
,
"
he
said
,
at
length
,
in
a
low
voice
;
"
your
reasons
for
this
decision
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
right
to
know
them
,
"
rejoined
Rose
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
say
nothing
to
alter
my
resolution
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
duty
that
I
must
perform
.
 
<EOS>
I
owe
it
,
alike
to
others
,
and
to
myself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
yourself
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Harry
.
 
<EOS>
I
owe
it
to
myself
,
that
I
,
a
friendless
,
portionless
,
girl
,
with
a
blight
upon
my
name
,
should
not
give
your
friends
reason
to
suspect
that
I
had
sordidly
yielded
to
your
first
passion
,
and
fastened
myself
,
a
clog
,
on
all
your
hopes
and
projects
.
 
<EOS>
I
owe
it
to
you
and
yours
,
to
prevent
you
from
opposing
,
in
the
warmth
of
your
generous
nature
,
this
great
obstacle
to
your
progress
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
your
inclinations
chime
with
your
sense
of
duty
---
"
Harry
began
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
do
not
,
"
replied
Rose
,
colouring
deeply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
return
my
love
?
"
said
Harry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Say
but
<EOS>
that
,
dear
Rose
;
say
but
that
;
and
soften
the
bitterness
of
this
hard
disappointment
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
could
have
done
so
,
without
doing
heavy
wrong
to
him
I
loved
,
"
rejoined
Rose
,
<EOS>
"
I
could
have
---
"
   
"
Have
received
this
declaration
very
differently
?
"
said
Harry
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
conceal
that
from
me
,
at
least
,
Rose
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
,
"
said
Rose
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
disengaging
her
hand
,
"
why
should
we
prolong
this
painful
interview
?
 
<EOS>
Most
painful
to
me
,
and
yet
productive
of
lasting
happiness
,
notwithstanding
;
for
it
WILL
be
happiness
to
know
that
I
once
held
the
high
place
in
your
regard
which
I
now
occupy
,
and
every
triumph
you
achieve
in
life
will
animate
me
with
new
fortitude
and
firmness
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
,
Harry
!
 
<EOS>
As
we
have
met
to
-
day
,
we
meet
no
more
;
but
in
other
relations
than
those
in
which
this
conversation
have
placed
us
,
we
may
be
long
and
happily
entwined
;
and
may
every
blessing
that
the
prayers
of
a
true
and
earnest
heart
can
call
down
from
the
source
of
all
truth
and
sincerity
,
cheer
and
prosper
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Another
word
,
Rose
,
"
said
Harry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
reason
in
your
own
words
.
 
<EOS>
From
your
own
lips
,
let
me
hear
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
prospect
before
you
,
"
answered
Rose
,
firmly
,
"
is
a
brilliant
one
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
honours
to
which
great
talents
and
powerful
connections
can
help
men
in
public
life
,
are
in
store
for
you
.
<EOS>
But
those
connections
are
proud
;
and
I
will
neither
mingle
with
such
as
may
hold
in
scorn
the
mother
who
gave
me
life
;
nor
bring
disgrace
or
failure
on
the
son
of
her
who
has
so
well
supplied
that
mother
's
place
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
"
said
the
young
lady
,
turning
away
,
as
her
temporary
firmness
forsook
her
,
"
there
is
a
stain
upon
my
name
,
which
the
world
visits
on
innocent
heads
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
carry
it
into
no
blood
but
my
own
;
and
the
reproach
shall
rest
alone
on
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
One
word
more
,
Rose
.
 
<EOS>
Dearest
Rose
!
<EOS>
one
more
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Harry
,
throwing
himself
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
been
less
---
less
fortunate
,
the
world
would
call
it
---
if
some
obscure
and
peaceful
life
had
been
my
destiny
---
if
I
had
been
poor
,
sick
,
helpless
---
would
you
have
turned
from
me
then
?
 
<EOS>
Or
has
my
probable
advancement
to
riches
and
honour
,
given
this
scruple
birth
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
not
press
me
to
reply
,
"
answered
Rose
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
question
does
not
arise
,
and
never
will
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
unfair
,
almost
unkind
,
to
urge
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
your
answer
be
what
I
almost
dare
to
hope
it
is
,
"
retorted
Harry
,
"
it
will
shed
a
gleam
of
happiness
upon
my
lonely
way
,
and
light
the
path
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
an
idle
thing
to
do
so
much
,
by
the
utterance
of
a
few
brief
words
,
for
one
who
loves
you
beyond
all
else
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Rose
:
in
the
name
of
my
ardent
and
enduring
attachment
;
in
the
name
of
all
I
have
suffered
for
you
,
and
all
you
doom
me
to
undergo
;
answer
me
this
one
question
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
if
your
lot
had
been
differently
cast
,
"
rejoined
Rose
;
"
if
you
had
been
even
a
little
,
but
not
so
far
,
above
me
;
if
I
could
have
been
a
help
and
comfort
to
you
in
any
humble
scene
of
peace
and
retirement
,
and
not
a
blot
and
drawback
in
ambitious
and
distinguished
crowds
;
I
should
have
been
spared
this
trial
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
every
reason
to
be
happy
,
very
happy
,
now
;
but
then
,
Harry
,
I
own
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
happier
.
"
   
<EOS>
Busy
recollections
of
old
hopes
,
cherished
as
a
girl
,
long
ago
,
crowded
into
the
mind
of
Rose
,
while
making
this
avowal
;
but
they
brought
tears
with
them
,
as
old
hopes
will
when
they
come
back
withered
;
and
they
relieved
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
help
this
weakness
,
and
it
makes
my
purpose
stronger
,
"
said
Rose
,
extending
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
leave
you
now
,
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ask
one
promise
,
"
said
Harry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Once
,
and
only
once
more
,
---
say
within
a
year
,
but
it
may
be
much
sooner
,
---
I
may
speak
to
you
again
on
this
subject
,
for
the
last
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
to
press
me
to
alter
my
right
determination
,
"
replied
Rose
,
with
a
melancholy
smile
;
"
it
will
be
useless
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Harry
;
"
to
hear
you
repeat
it
,
if
you
will
---
finally
repeat
it
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
lay
at
your
feet
,
<EOS>
whatever
of
station
of
fortune
I
may
possess
;
and
if
you
still
adhere
to
your
present
resolution
,
will
not
seek
,
by
word
or
act
,
to
change
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
let
it
be
so
,
"
rejoined
Rose
;
"
it
is
but
one
pang
the
more
,
and
by
that
time
I
may
be
enabled
to
bear
it
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
extended
her
hand
again
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
young
man
caught
her
to
his
bosom
;
and
imprinting
one
kiss
on
her
beautiful
forehead
,
hurried
from
the
room
.

Chapter
36

<EOS>
Is
a
very
short
one
,
and
may
appear
of
no
great
importance
in
its
place
,
but
it
should
be
read
notwithstanding
,
as
a
sequel
to
the
last
,
and
a
key
to
one
that
will
follow
when
its
time
arrives
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
are
resolved
to
be
my
travelling
companion
this
morning
;
eh
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
doctor
,
as
Harry
Maylie
joined
him
and
Oliver
at
the
breakfast
-
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
are
not
in
the
same
mind
or
intention
two
half
-
hours
together
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
tell
me
a
different
tale
one
of
these
days
,
"
said
Harry
,
colouring
without
any
perceptible
reason
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
may
have
good
cause
to
do
so
,
"
replied
Mr
Losberne
;
"
though
I
confess
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
.
 
<EOS>
But
yesterday
morning
you
had
made
up
your
mind
,
in
a
great
hurry
,
to
stay
here
,
and
to
accompany
your
mother
,
like
a
dutiful
son
,
to
the
sea
-
side
.
<EOS>
Before
noon
,
you
announce
that
you
are
going
to
do
me
the
honour
of
accompanying
me
as
far
as
I
go
,
on
your
road
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
And
at
night
,
you
urge
me
,
with
great
mystery
,
to
start
before
the
ladies
are
stirring
;
the
consequence
of
which
is
,
that
young
Oliver
here
is
pinned
down
to
his
breakfast
when
he
ought
to
be
ranging
the
meadows
after
botanical
phenomena
of
all
kinds
.
<EOS>
Too
bad
,
is
n't
it
,
Oliver
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
been
very
sorry
not
to
have
been
at
home
when
you
and
Mr
Maylie
went
away
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
fine
fellow
,
"
said
the
doctor
;
"
you
shall
come
and
see
me
when
you
return
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
to
speak
seriously
,
Harry
;
has
any
communication
from
the
great
nobs
produced
this
sudden
anxiety
on
your
part
to
be
gone
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
great
nobs
,
"
replied
Harry
,
"
<EOS>
under
which
designation
,
I
presume
,
you
include
my
most
stately
uncle
,
have
not
communicated
with
me
at
all
,
since
I
have
been
here
;
nor
,
at
this
time
of
the
year
,
is
it
likely
that
anything
would
occur
to
render
necessary
my
immediate
attendance
among
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
"
you
are
a
queer
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
But
of
course
they
will
get
you
into
parliament
at
the
election
before
Christmas
,
and
these
sudden
shiftings
and
changes
are
no
bad
preparation
for
political
life
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
something
in
that
.
 
<EOS>
Good
training
is
always
desirable
,
whether
the
race
be
for
place
,
cup
,
or
sweepstakes
.
"
   
<EOS>
Harry
Maylie
looked
as
if
he
could
have
followed
up
this
short
dialogue
by
one
or
two
remarks
that
would
have
staggered
the
doctor
not
a
little
;
but
he
contented
himself
with
saying
,
"
We
shall
see
,
"
and
pursued
the
subject
no
farther
.
 
<EOS>
The
post
-
chaise
drove
up
to
the
door
shortly
afterwards
;
and
Giles
coming
in
for
the
luggage
,
the
good
doctor
bustled
out
,
to
see
it
packed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oliver
,
"
said
Harry
Maylie
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
let
me
speak
a
word
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
walked
into
the
window
-
recess
to
which
Mr
Maylie
beckoned
him
;
much
surprised
at
the
mixture
of
sadness
and
boisterous
spirits
,
which
his
whole
behaviour
displayed
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
write
well
now
?
<EOS>
"
said
Harry
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
be
at
home
again
,
perhaps
for
some
time
;
I
wish
you
would
write
to
me
---
say
once
a
fort
-
night
:
 
<EOS>
every
alternate
Monday
:
to
the
General
Post
Office
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
certainly
,
sir
;
I
shall
be
proud
to
do
it
,
"
exclaimed
Oliver
,
greatly
delighted
with
the
commission
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
know
how
---
how
my
mother
and
Miss
Maylie
are
,
"
said
the
young
man
;
"
and
you
can
fill
up
a
sheet
by
telling
me
what
walks
you
take
,
and
what
you
talk
about
,
and
whether
she
---
they
,
I
mean
---
seem
happy
and
quite
well
.
<EOS>
You
understand
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
quite
,
sir
,
quite
,
"
replied
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
you
did
not
mention
it
to
them
,
"
said
Harry
,
hurrying
over
his
words
;
"
because
it
might
make
my
mother
anxious
to
write
to
me
oftener
,
and
it
is
a
trouble
and
worry
to
her
.
<EOS>
Let
is
be
a
secret
between
you
and
me
;
and
mind
you
tell
me
everything
!
 
<EOS>
I
depend
upon
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
,
quite
elated
and
honoured
by
a
sense
of
his
importance
,
faithfully
promised
to
be
secret
and
explicit
in
his
communications
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Maylie
took
leave
of
him
,
with
many
assurances
of
his
regard
and
protection
.
   
<EOS>
The
doctor
was
in
the
chaise
;
Giles
(
who
,
it
had
been
arranged
,
should
be
left
behind
)
held
the
door
open
in
his
hand
;
and
the
women
-
servants
were
in
the
garden
,
looking
on
.
 
<EOS>
Harry
cast
one
slight
glance
at
the
latticed
window
,
and
jumped
into
the
carriage
.
   
<EOS>
"
Drive
on
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
"
hard
,
fast
,
full
gallop
!
 
<EOS>
Nothing
short
of
flying
will
keep
pace
with
me
,
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
cried
the
doctor
,
letting
down
the
front
glass
in
a
great
hurry
,
and
shouting
to
the
postillion
;
"
something
very
short
of
flyng
will
keep
pace
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
?
"
   
<EOS>
Jingling
and
clattering
,
till
distance
rendered
its
noise
inaudible
,
and
its
rapid
progress
only
perceptible
to
the
eye
,
the
vehicle
wound
its
way
along
the
road
,
almost
hidden
in
a
cloud
of
dust
:
now
wholly
disappearing
,
and
now
becoming
visible
again
,
as
intervening
objects
,
or
the
intricacies
of
the
way
,
permitted
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
even
the
dusty
cloud
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
,
that
the
gazers
dispersed
.
   
<EOS>
And
there
was
one
looker
-
on
,
who
remained
with
eyes
fixed
upon
the
spot
where
the
carriage
had
disappeared
,
long
after
it
was
many
miles
away
;
for
,
behind
the
white
curtain
which
had
shrouded
her
from
view
when
Harry
raised
his
eyes
towards
the
window
,
sat
Rose
herself
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
seems
in
high
spirits
and
happy
,
"
she
said
,
at
length
.
<EOS>
"
I
feared
for
a
time
he
might
be
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
,
very
glad
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tears
are
signs
of
gladness
as
well
as
grief
;
but
those
which
coursed
down
Rose
's
face
,
as
she
sat
pensively
at
the
window
,
still
gazing
in
the
same
direction
,
seemed
to
tell
more
of
sorrow
than
of
joy
.

In
which
the
reader
may
perceive
a
contrast
,
not
uncommon
in
matrimonial
cases

<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
sat
in
the
workhouse
parlour
,
with
his
eyes
moodily
fixed
on
the
cheerless
grate
,
whence
,
as
it
was
summer
time
,
no
brighter
gleam
proceeded
,
than
the
reflection
of
certain
sickly
rays
of
the
sun
,
which
were
sent
back
from
its
cold
and
shining
surface
.
 
<EOS>
A
paper
fly
-
cage
dangled
from
the
ceiling
,
to
which
he
occasionally
raised
his
eyes
in
gloomy
thought
;
and
,
as
the
heedless
insects
hovered
round
the
gaudy
net
-
work
,
Mr
Bumble
would
heave
a
deep
sigh
,
while
a
more
gloomy
shadow
overspread
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
was
meditating
;
it
might
be
that
the
insects
brought
to
mind
,
some
painful
passage
in
his
own
past
life
.
   
<EOS>
Nor
was
Mr
Bumble
's
gloom
the
only
thing
calculated
to
awaken
a
pleasing
melancholy
in
the
bosom
of
a
spectator
.
<EOS>
There
were
not
wanting
other
appearances
,
and
those
closely
connected
with
his
own
person
,
which
announced
that
a
great
change
had
taken
place
in
the
position
of
his
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
The
laced
coat
,
and
the
cocked
hat
<EOS>
;
where
were
they
?
 
<EOS>
He
still
wore
knee
-
breeches
,
and
dark
cotton
stockings
on
his
nether
limbs
;
but
they
were
not
THE
breeches
.
 
<EOS>
The
coat
was
wide
-
skirted
;
and
in
that
respect
like
THE
coat
,
but
,
oh
how
different
!
 
<EOS>
The
mighty
cocked
hat
was
replaced
by
a
modest
round
one
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
was
no
longer
a
beadle

There
are
some
promotions
in
life
,
which
,
independent
of
the
more
substantial
rewards
they
offer
,
require
peculiar
value
and
dignity
from
the
coats
and
waistcoats
connected
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
A
field

marshal
has
his

a

his

a

his

Strip
the

of
his

Dignity

holiness

are
more
questions
of
coat

waistcoat

some
people
imagine

gold
-
laced
coat
,
and
staff
,
had
all
three
descended
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
to
-
morrow
two
months
it
was
done
!
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
with
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
seems
a
age
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
might
have
meant
that
he
had
concentrated
a
whole
existence
of
happiness
into
the
short
space
of
eight
weeks
;
but
the
sigh
---
there
was
a
vast
deal
of
meaning
in
the
sigh
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
sold
myself
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
pursuing
the
same
train
of
relection
,
"
for
six
teaspoons
,
a
pair
of
sugar
-
tongs
,
and
a
milk
-
pot
;
with
a
small
quantity
of
second
-
hand
furniture
,
and
twenty
pound
in
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
very
reasonable
.
 
<EOS>
Cheap
,
dirt
cheap
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cheap
!
"
cried
a
shrill
voice
in
Mr
Bumble
's
ear
:
<EOS>
"
you
would
have
been
dear
at
any
price
;
and
dear
enough
I
paid
for
you
,
Lord
above
knows
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
turned
,
and
encountered
the
face
of
his
interesting
consort
,
who
,
imperfectly
comprehending
the
few
words
she
had
overheard
of
his
complaint
,
had
hazarded
the
foregoing
remark
at
a
venture
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Bumble
,
ma'am
!
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
with
a
sentimental
sternness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
cried
the
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
the
goodness
to
look
at
me
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
fixing
his
eyes
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
(
If
she
stands
such
a
eye
as
that
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
to
himself
,
"
she
can
stand
anything
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
eye
I
never
knew
to
fail
with
paupers
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
fails
with
her
,
my
power
is
gone
.
"
)
   
<EOS>
Whether
an
exceedingly
small
expansion
of
eye
be
sufficient
to
quell
paupers
,
who
,
being
lightly
fed
,
are
in
no
very
high
condition
;
or
whether
the
late
Mrs
Corney
was
particularly
proof
against
eagle
glances
;
are
matters
of
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
The
matter
of
fact
,
is
,
that
the
matron
was
in
no
way
overpowered
by
Mr
Bumble
's
scowl
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
treated
it
with
great
disdain
,
and
even
raised
a
laugh
threreat
,
which
sounded
as
though
it
were
genuine
.
   
<EOS>
On
hearing
this
most
unexpected
sound
,
Mr
Bumble
looked
,
first
incredulous
,
and
afterwards
amazed
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
relapsed
into
his
former
state
;
nor
did
he
rouse
himself
until
his
attention
was
again
awakened
by
the
voice
of
his
partner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
sit
snoring
there
,
all
day
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mrs
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
sit
here
,
as
long
as
I
think
proper
,
ma'am
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Bumble
;
"
and
although
I
was
NOT
snoring
,
I
shall
snore
,
gape
,
sneeze
,
laugh
,
or
cry
,
as
the
humour
strikes
me
;
such
being
my
prerogative
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
PREROGATIVE
!
"
<EOS>
sneered
Mrs
Bumble
,
with
ineffable
contempt
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
said
the
word
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
prerogative
of
a
man
is
to
command
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
's
the
prerogative
of
a
woman
,
in
the
name
of
Goodness
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
relict
of
Mr
Corney
deceased
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
obey
,
ma'am
,
"
thundered
Mr
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
late
unfortunate
husband
should
have
taught
it
you
;
and
then
,
perhaps
,
he
might
have
been
alive
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
he
was
,
poor
man
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Bumble
,
seeing
at
a
glance
,
that
the
decisive
moment
had
now
arrived
,
and
that
a
blow
struck
for
the
mastership
on
one
side
or
other
,
must
necessarily
be
final
and
conclusive
,
no
sooner
heard
this
allusion
to
the
dead
and
gone
,
than
she
dropped
into
a
chair
,
and
with
a
loud
scream
that
Mr
Bumble
was
a
hard
-
hearted
brute
,
fell
into
a
paroxysm
of
tears
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
tears
were
not
the
things
to
find
their
way
to
Mr
Bumble
's
soul
;
his
heart
was
waterproof
.
 
<EOS>
Like
washable
beaver
hats
that
improve
with
rain
,
his
nerves
were
rendered
stouter
and
more
vigorous
,
by
showers
of
tears
,
which
,
being
tokens
of
weakness
,
and
so
far
tacit
admissions
of
his
own
power
,
please
and
exalted
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
eyed
his
good
lady
with
looks
of
great
satisfaction
,
and
begged
,
in
an
encouraging
manner
,
that
she
should
cry
her
hardest
:
 
the
exercise
being
looked
upon
,
by
the
faculty
,
as
strongly
conducive
to
health
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
opens
the
lungs
,
washes
the
countenance
,
exercises
the
eyes
,
and
softens
down
the
temper
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
cry
away
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
discharged
himself
of
this
pleasantry
,
Mr
Bumble
took
his
hat
from
a
peg
,
and
putting
it
on
,
rather
rakishly
,
on
one
side
,
as
a
man
might
,
who
felt
he
had
asserted
his
superiority
in
a
becoming
manner
,
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
and
sauntered
towards
the
door
,
with
much
ease
and
waggishness
depicted
in
his
whole
appearance
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
Mrs
Corney
that
was
,
had
tried
the
tears
,
because
they
were
less
troublesome
than
a
manual
assault
;
but
,
she
was
quite
prepared
to
make
trial
of
the
latter
mode
of
proceeding
,
as
Mr
Bumble
was
not
long
in
discovering
.
   
<EOS>
The
first
proof
he
experienced
of
the
fact
,
was
conveyed
in
a
hollow
sound
,
immediately
succeeded
by
the
sudden
flying
off
of
his
hat
to
the
opposite
end
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
This
preliminary
proceeding
laying
bare
his
head
,
the
expert
lady
,
clasping
him
tightly
round
the
throat
with
one
hand
,
inflicted
a
shower
of
blows
(
dealt
with
singular
vigour
and
dexterity
)
upon
it
with
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
This
done
,
she
created
a
little
variety
by
scratching
his
face
,
and
tearing
his
hair
;
and
,
having
,
by
this
time
,
inflicted
as
much
punishment
as
she
deemed
necessary
for
the
offence
<EOS>
,
she
pushed
him
over
a
chair
,
which
was
luckily
well
situated
for
the
purpose
:
 
and
defied
him
to
talk
about
his
prerogative
again
,
if
he
dared
.
   
<EOS>
"
Get
up
!
"
said
Mrs
Bumble
,
in
a
voice
of
command
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
take
yourself
away
from
here
,
unless
you
want
me
to
do
something
desperate
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
rose
with
a
very
rueful
countenance
:
 
wondering
much
what
something
desperate
might
be
.
 
<EOS>
Picking
up
his
hat
,
he
looked
towards
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
?
"
demanded
Mr
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
my
dear
,
certainly
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Bumble
,
making
a
quicker
motion
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
intend
to
---
I
'm
going
,
my
dear
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
so
very
violent
,
<EOS>
that
really
I
---
"
   
At
this
instant
,
Mrs
Bumble
stepped
hastily
forward
to
replace
the
carpet
,
which
had
been
kicked
up
in
the
scuffle
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
immediately
darted
out
of
the
room
,
without
bestowing
another
thought
on
his
unfinished
sentence
:
 
leaving
the
late
Mrs
Corney
in
full
possession
of
the
field
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
was
fairly
taken
by
surprise
,
and
fairly
beaten
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
decided
propensity
for
bullying
:
 
<EOS>
derived
no
inconsiderable
pleasure
from
the
exercise
of
petty
cruelty
;
and
,
consequently
,
was
(
it
is
needless
to
say
)
a
coward
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
by
no
means
a
disparagement
to
his
character
;
for
many
official
personages
,
who
are
held
in
high
respect
and
admiration
,
are
the
victims
of
similar
infirmities
.
 
<EOS>
The
remark
is
made
,
indeed
,
rather
in
his
favour
than
otherwise
,
and
with
a
view
of
impressing
the
reader
with
a
just
sense
of
his
qualifications
for
office
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
the
measure
of
his
degradation
was
not
yet
full
.
 
<EOS>
After
making
a
tour
of
the
house
,
and
thinking
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
the
poor
-
laws
really
were
too
hard
on
people
;
and
that
men
who
ran
away
from
their
wives
,
leaving
them
chargeable
to
the
parish
,
ought
,
in
justice
to
be
visited
with
no
punishment
at
all
,
but
rather
rewarded
as
meritorious
individuals
who
had
suffered
much
;
Mr
Bumble
came
to
a
room
where
some
of
the
female
paupers
were
usually
employed
in
washing
the
parish
linen
:
 
when
the
sound
of
voices
in
conversation
,
now
proceeded
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
summoning
up
all
his
native
dignity
.
<EOS>
"
These
women
at
least
shall
continue
to
respect
the
prerogative
.
<EOS>
Hallo
!
<EOS>
hallo
there
!
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
by
this
noise
,
you
hussies
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
Mr
Bumble
opened
the
door
,
and
walked
in
with
a
very
fierce
and
angry
manner
:
 
which
was
at
once
exchanged
for
a
most
humiliated
and
cowering
air
,
as
his
eyes
unexpectedly
rested
on
the
form
of
his
lady
wife
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
"
I
did
n't
know
you
were
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
know
I
was
here
!
"
repeated
Mrs
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
YOU
do
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
they
were
talking
rather
too
much
to
be
doing
their
work
properly
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
Mr
Bumble
:
 
glancing
distractedly
at
a
couple
of
old
women
at
the
wash
-
tub
,
who
were
comparing
notes
of
admiration
at
the
workhouse
-
master
's
humility
.
   
<EOS>
"
YOU
thought
they
were
talking
too
much
?
"
said
Mrs
Bumble
.
<EOS>
"
What
business
is
it
of
yours
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
---
"
urged
Mr
Bumble
submissively
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
business
is
it
of
yours
?
"
demanded
Mrs
Bumble
,
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
true
,
you
're
matron
here
,
my
dear
,
"
submitted
Mr
Bumble
;
"
but
I
thought
you
might
n't
be
in
the
way
just
then
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
Mr
Bumble
,
"
returned
his
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
do
n't
want
any
of
your
interference
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
great
deal
too
fond
of
poking
your
nose
into
things
that
do
n't
concern
you
,
making
everybody
in
the
house
laugh
,
the
moment
your
back
is
turned
,
and
making
yourself
look
like
a
fool
every
hour
in
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
Be
off
;
come
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
,
seeing
with
excruciating
feelings
,
the
delight
of
the
two
old
paupers
,
who
were
tittering
together
most
rapturously
,
hesitated
for
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Bumble
,
whose
patience
brooked
no
delay
,
caught
up
a
bowl
of
soap
-
suds
,
and
motioning
him
towards
the
door
,
ordered
him
instantly
to
depart
,
on
pain
of
receiving
the
contents
upon
his
portly
person
.
   
<EOS>
What
could
Mr
Bumble
do
?
 
<EOS>
He
looked
dejectedly
round
,
and
slunk
away
;
and
,
as
he
reached
the
door
,
the
titterings
of
the
paupers
broke
into
a
shrill
chuckle
of
irrepressible
delight
.
 
<EOS>
It
wanted
but
<EOS>
this
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
degraded
in
their
eyes
;
he
had
lost
caste
and
station
before
the
very
paupers
;
he
had
fallen
from
all
the
height
and
pomp
of
beadleship
,
to
the
lowest
depth
of
the
most
snubbed
hen
-
peckery
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
in
two
months
!
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
filled
with
dismal
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
"
Two
months
!
 
<EOS>
No
more
than
two
months
ago
,
I
was
not
only
my
own
master
,
but
everybody
else
's
,
so
far
as
the
porochial
workhouse
was
concerned
,
and
now
!
<EOS>
---
"
   
It
was
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
boxed
the
ears
of
the
boy
who
opened
the
gate
for
him
(
for
he
had
reached
the
portal
in
his
reverie
)
;
and
walked
,
distractedly
,
into
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
He
walked
up
one
street
,
and
down
another
,
until
exercise
had
abated
the
first
passion
of
his
grief
;
and
then
the
revulsion
of
feeling
made
him
thirsty
.
 
<EOS>
He
passed
a
great
many
public
-
houses
;
but
,
at
length
paused
before
one
in
a
by
-
way
,
whose
parlour
,
as
he
gathered
from
a
hasty
peep
over
the
blinds
,
was
deserted
,
save
by
one
solitary
customer
.
 
<EOS>
It
began
to
rain
,
heavily
,
at
the
moment
.
 
<EOS>
This
determined
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
stepped
in
;
and
ordering
something
to
drink
,
as
he
passed
the
bar
,
entered
the
apartment
into
which
he
had
looked
from
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
who
was
seated
there
,
was
tall
and
dark
,
and
wore
a
large
cloak
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
the
air
of
a
stranger
;
and
seemed
,
by
a
certain
haggardness
in
his
look
,
as
well
as
by
the
dusty
soils
on
his
dress
,
to
have
travelled
some
distance
.
 
<EOS>
He
eyed
Bumble
askance
,
as
he
entered
,
but
scarcely
deigned
to
nod
his
head
in
acknowledgment
of
his
salutation
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
had
quite
dignity
enough
for
two
;
supposing
even
that
the
stranger
had
been
more
familiar
:
 
<EOS>
so
he
drank
his
gin
-
and
-
water
in
silence
,
and
read
the
paper
with
great
show
of
pomp
and
circumstance
.
   
<EOS>
It
so
happened
,
however
:
as
it
will
happen
very
often
,
when
men
fall
into
company
under
such
circumstances
:
 
that
Mr
Bumble
felt
,
every
now
and
then
,
a
powerful
inducement
,
which
he
could
not
resist
,
to
steal
a
look
at
the
stranger
:
 
and
that
whenever
he
did
so
,
he
withdrew
his
eyes
,
in
some
confusion
,
to
find
that
the
stranger
was
at
that
moment
stealing
a
look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
's
awkwardness
was
enhanced
by
the
very
remarkable
expression
of
the
stranger
's
eye
,
which
was
keen
and
bright
,
but
shadowed
by
a
scowl
of
distrust
and
suspicion
,
unlike
anything
he
had
ever
observed
before
,
and
repulsive
to
behold
.
   
<EOS>
When
they
had
encountered
each
other
's
glance
several
times
in
this
way
,
the
stranger
,
in
a
harsh
,
deep
voice
,
broke
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Were
you
looking
for
me
,
"
he
said
,
"
when
you
peered
in
at
the
window
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
that
I
am
aware
of
,
unless
you
're
Mr
 
---
"
 
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Bumble
stopped
short
;
for
he
was
curious
to
know
the
stranger
's
name
,
and
thought
in
his
impatience
,
he
might
supply
the
blank
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
were
not
,
"
said
the
stranger
;
and
expression
of
quiet
sarcasm
playing
about
his
mouth
;
"
or
you
have
known
my
name
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
recommend
you
not
to
ask
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
meant
no
harm
,
young
man
,
"
observed
Mr
Bumble
,
majestically
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
have
done
none
,
"
said
the
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
Another
silence
succeeded
this
short
dialogue
:
 
which
was
again
broken
by
the
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
you
before
,
I
think
?
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
were
differently
dressed
at
that
time
,
and
I
only
passed
you
in
the
street
,
but
I
should
know
you
again
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
beadle
here
,
once
;
were
you
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
in
some
surprise
;
"
porochial
beadle
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
so
,
"
rejoined
the
other
,
nodding
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
in
that
character
I
saw
you
.
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Master
of
the
workhouse
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Bumble
,
slowly
and
impressively
,
to
check
any
undue
familiarity
the
stranger
might
otherwise
assume
.
 
<EOS>
"
Master
of
the
workhouse
,
young
man
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
the
same
eye
to
your
own
interest
,
that
you
always
had
,
I
doubt
not
?
"
resumed
the
stranger
,
looking
keenly
into
Mr
Bumble
's
eyes
,
as
he
raised
them
in
astonishment
at
the
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
scruple
to
answer
freely
,
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
pretty
well
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
a
married
man
,
"
replied
Mr
Bumble
,
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
,
and
surveying
the
stranger
,
from
head
to
foot
,
in
evident
perplexity
,
"
is
not
more
averse
to
turning
an
honest
penny
when
he
can
,
than
a
single
one
.
 
<EOS>
Porochial
officers
are
not
so
well
paid
that
they
can
afford
to
refuse
any
little
extra
fee
,
when
it
comes
to
them
in
a
civil
and
proper
manner
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
stranger
smiled
,
and
nodded
his
head
again
:
as
much
to
say
,
he
had
not
mistaken
his
man
;
then
rang
the
bell
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fill
this
glass
again
,
"
he
said
,
<EOS>
handing
Mr
Bumble
's
empty
tumbler
to
the
landlord
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
it
be
strong
and
hot
.
 
<EOS>
You
like
it
<EOS>
so
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Not
too
strong
,
"
replied
Mr
Bumble
,
with
a
delicate
cough
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
understand
what
that
means
,
landlord
!
"
said
the
stranger
,
drily
.
   
<EOS>
The
host
smiled
,
disappeared
,
and
shortly
afterwards
returned
with
a
steaming
jorum
:
of
which
,
the
first
gulp
brought
the
water
into
Mr
Bumble
's
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
listen
to
me
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
after
closing
the
door
and
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
came
down
to
this
place
,
to
-
day
,
to
find
you
out
;
and
,
by
one
of
those
chances
which
the
devil
throws
in
the
way
of
his
friends
sometimes
,
you
walked
into
the
very
room
I
was
sitting
in
,
while
you
were
uppermost
in
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
some
information
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
ask
you
to
give
it
for
mothing
,
slight
as
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
Put
up
that
,
to
begin
with
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
pushed
a
couple
of
sovereigns
across
the
table
to
his
companion
,
carefully
,
as
though
unwilling
that
the
chinking
of
money
should
be
heard
without
.
 
<EOS>
When
Mr
Bumble
had
scrupulously
examined
the
coins
,
to
see
that
they
were
genuine
,
and
had
put
them
up
,
with
much
satisfaction
,
in
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
,
he
went
on
:
   
"
<EOS>
Carry
your
memory
back
---
let
me
see
---
twelve
years
,
last
winter
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
long
time
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
done
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
scene
,
the
workhouse
.
"
   
"
Good
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
the
time
,
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
the
place
,
the
crazy
hole
,
wherever
it
was
,
in
which
miserable
drabs
brought
forth
the
life
and
health
so
often
denied
to
themselves
---
gave
birth
to
puling
children
for
the
parish
to
rear
;
and
hid
their
shame
,
rot
'em
in
the
grave
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
lying
-
in
room
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
not
quite
following
the
stranger
's
excited
description
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
boy
was
born
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
many
boys
,
"
observed
Mr
Bumble
,
shaking
his
head
,
despondingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
murrain
on
the
young
devils
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
stranger
;
"
I
speak
of
one
;
a
meek
-
looking
,
pale
-
faced
boy
,
who
was
apprenticed
down
here
,
to
a
coffin
-
maker
---
I
wish
he
had
made
his
coffin
,
and
screwed
his
body
in
it
---
and
who
afterwards
ran
away
to
London
,
as
it
was
supposed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
mean
Oliver
!
 
<EOS>
Young
Twist
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Bumble
;
"
I
remember
him
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
n't
a
obstinater
young
rascal
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
It
's
not
of
him
I
want
to
hear
;
I
've
heard
enough
of
him
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
stopping
Mr
Bumble
in
the
outset
of
a
tirade
on
the
subject
of
poor
Oliver
's
vices
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
of
a
woman
;
the
hag
that
nursed
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Where
is
she
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
is
she
?
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
whom
the
gin
-
and
-
water
had
rendered
facetious
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
hard
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
no
midwifery
there
<EOS>
,
whichever
place
she
's
gone
to
;
so
I
suppose
she
's
out
of
employment
,
anyway
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
demanded
the
stranger
,
sternly
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
she
died
last
winter
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
looked
fixedly
at
him
when
he
had
given
this
information
,
and
although
he
did
not
withdraw
his
eyes
for
some
time
afterwards
,
his
gaze
gradually
became
vacant
and
abstracted
,
and
he
seemed
lost
in
thought
.
 
<EOS>
For
some
time
,
he
appeared
doubtful
whether
he
ought
to
be
relieved
or
disappointed
by
the
intelligence
;
but
at
length
he
breathed
more
freely
;
and
withdrawing
his
eyes
,
observed
that
it
was
no
great
matter
.
 
<EOS>
With
that
he
rose
,
as
if
to
depart
.
   
<EOS>
But
Mr
Bumble
was
cunning
enough
;
and
he
at
once
saw
that
an
opportunity
was
opened
,
for
the
lucrative
disposal
of
some
secret
in
the
possession
of
his
better
half
.
 
<EOS>
He
well
remembered
the
night
of
old
Sally
's
death
,
which
the
occurrences
of
that
day
had
given
him
good
reason
to
recollect
,
as
the
occasion
on
which
he
had
proposed
to
Mrs
Corney
;
and
although
that
lady
had
never
confided
to
him
the
disclosure
of
which
she
had
been
the
solitary
witness
,
he
had
heard
enough
to
know
that
it
related
to
something
that
had
occurred
in
the
old
woman
's
attendance
,
as
workhouse
nurse
,
upon
the
young
mother
of
Oliver
Twist
.
 
<EOS>
Hastily
calling
this
circumstance
to
mind
,
he
informed
the
stranger
,
with
an
air
of
mystery
,
that
one
woman
had
been
closeted
with
the
old
harridan
shortly
before
she
died
;
and
that
she
could
,
as
he
had
reason
to
believe
,
throw
some
light
on
the
subject
of
his
inquiry
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
find
her
?
"
said
the
stranger
,
thrown
off
his
guard
;
and
plainly
showing
that
all
his
fears
(
whatever
they
were
)
were
aroused
afresh
by
the
intelligence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Only
through
me
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
?
"
cried
the
stranger
,
hastily
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
,
"
rejoined
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
nine
in
the
evening
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
producing
a
scrap
of
paper
,
and
writing
down
upon
it
,
an
obscure
address
by
the
water
-
side
,
in
characters
that
betrayed
his
agitation
;
"
at
nine
in
the
evening
,
bring
her
to
me
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
n't
tell
you
to
be
secret
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
your
interest
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
he
led
the
way
to
the
door
,
after
stopping
to
pay
for
the
liquor
that
had
been
drunk
.
 
<EOS>
Shortly
remarking
that
their
roads
were
different
,
he
departed
,
without
more
ceremony
than
an
emphatic
repetition
of
the
hour
of
appointment
for
the
following
night
.
   
<EOS>
On
glancing
at
the
address
,
the
parochial
functionary
observed
that
it
contained
no
name
.
 
<EOS>
The
stranger
had
not
gone
far
,
so
he
made
after
him
to
ask
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
?
"
cried
the
man
.
<EOS>
turning
quickly
round
,
as
Bumble
touched
him
on
the
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Following
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
to
ask
a
question
,
"
said
the
other
,
pointing
to
the
scrap
of
paper
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
name
am
I
to
ask
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Monks
!
"
rejoined
the
man
;
and
strode
hastily
,
away
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
38
.
<EOS>
Containing
an
account
of
what
passed
between
Mr
and
Mrs
Bumble
,
and
Mr
Monks
,
at
their
nocturnal
interview
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
dull
,
close
,
overcast
summer
evening
.
 
<EOS>
The
clouds
,
which
had
been
threatening
all
day
,
spread
out
in
a
dense
and
sluggish
mass
of
vapour
,
already
yielded
large
drops
of
rain
,
and
seemed
to
presage
a
violent
thunder
-
storm
,
when
Mr
and
Mrs
Bumble
,
turning
out
of
the
main
street
of
the
town
,
directed
their
course
towards
a
scattered
little
colony
of
ruinous
houses
,
distant
from
it
<EOS>
some
mile
and
a
-
half
,
or
thereabouts
,
and
erected
on
a
low
unwholesome
swamp
,
bordering
upon
the
river
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
both
wrapped
in
old
and
shabby
outer
garments
,
which
might
,
perhaps
,
serve
the
double
purpose
of
protecting
their
persons
from
the
rain
,
and
sheltering
them
from
observation
.
 
<EOS>
The
husband
carried
a
lantern
,
from
which
,
however
,
no
light
yet
shone
;
and
trudged
on
,
a
few
paces
in
front
,
as
though
---
the
way
being
dirty
---
to
give
his
wife
the
benefit
of
treading
in
his
heavy
footprints
.
 
<EOS>
They
went
on
,
in
profound
silence
;
every
now
and
then
,
Mr
Bumble
relaxed
his
pace
,
and
turned
his
head
as
if
to
make
sure
that
his
helpmate
was
following
;
then
,
discovering
that
she
was
close
at
his
heels
,
he
mended
his
rate
of
walking
,
and
proceeded
,
at
a
considerable
increase
of
speed
,
towards
their
place
of
destination
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
far
from
being
a
place
of
doubtful
character
;
for
it
had
long
been
known
as
the
residence
of
none
but
low
ruffians
,
who
,
under
various
pretences
of
living
by
their
labour
,
subsisted
chiefly
on
plunder
and
crime
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
collection
of
mere
hovels
:
 
some
,
hastily
built
with
loose
bricks
:
others
,
of
old
worm
-
eaten
ship
-
timber
:
jumbled
together
without
any
attempt
at
order
or
arrangement
,
and
planted
,
for
the
most
part
,
within
a
few
feet
of
the
river
's
bank
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
leaky
boats
drawn
up
on
the
mud
,
and
made
fast
to
the
dwarf
wall
which
skirted
it
:
 
and
here
and
there
an
oar
or
coil
of
rope
:
 
appeared
,
at
first
,
to
indicate
that
the
inhabitants
of
these
miserable
cottages
pursued
some
avocation
on
the
river
;
but
a
glance
at
the
shattered
and
useless
condition
of
the
articles
thus
displayed
,
would
have
led
a
passer
-
by
,
without
much
difficulty
,
to
the
conjecture
that
they
were
disposed
there
,
rather
for
the
preservation
of
appearances
,
than
with
any
view
to
their
being
actually
employed
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
heart
of
this
cluster
of
huts
;
and
skirting
the
river
,
which
its
upper
stories
overhung
;
stood
a
large
building
,
formerly
used
as
a
manufactory
of
some
kind
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
,
in
its
day
,
probably
furnished
employment
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
surrounding
tenements
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
had
long
since
gone
to
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
The
rat
,
the
worm
,
and
the
action
of
the
damp
,
had
weakened
and
rotted
the
piles
on
which
it
stood
;
and
a
considerable
portion
of
the
building
had
already
sunk
down
into
the
water
;
while
the
remainder
,
tottering
and
bending
over
the
dark
stream
,
seemed
to
wait
a
favourable
opportunity
of
following
its
old
companion
,
and
involving
itself
in
the
same
fate
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
before
this
ruinous
building
that
the
worthy
couple
paused
,
as
the
first
peal
of
distant
thunder
reverberated
in
the
air
,
and
the
rain
commenced
pouring
violently
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
place
should
be
somewhere
here
,
"
said
Bumble
,
consulting
a
scrap
of
paper
he
held
in
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Halloa
there
!
"
cried
a
voice
from
above
.
   
<EOS>
Following
the
sound
,
Mr
Bumble
raised
his
head
and
descried
a
man
looking
out
of
a
door
,
breast
-
high
,
on
the
second
story
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stand
still
,
a
minute
,
"
cried
the
voice
;
"
I
'll
be
with
you
directly
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
which
the
head
disappeared
,
and
the
door
closed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
the
man
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Mr
Bumble
's
good
lady
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
nodded
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
mind
what
I
told
you
,
"
said
the
matron
:
"
and
be
careful
to
say
as
little
as
you
can
,
or
you
'll
betray
us
at
once
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
,
who
had
eyed
the
building
with
very
rueful
looks
,
was
apparently
about
to
express
some
doubts
relative
to
the
advisability
of
proceeding
any
further
with
the
enterprise
just
then
,
when
he
was
prevented
by
the
appearance
of
Monks
:
who
opened
a
small
door
,
near
which
they
stood
,
and
beckoned
them
inwards
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
in
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
impatiently
,
stamping
his
foot
upon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
keep
me
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
woman
,
who
had
hesitated
at
first
,
walked
boldly
in
,
without
any
other
invitation
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
,
who
was
ashamed
or
afraid
to
lag
behind
,
followed
:
 
obviously
very
ill
at
ease
and
with
scarcely
any
of
that
remarkable
dignity
which
was
usually
his
chief
characteristic
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
made
you
stand
lingering
there
,
in
the
wet
?
"
said
Monks
,
turning
round
,
and
addressing
Bumble
,
after
he
had
bolted
the
door
behind
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
---
we
were
only
cooling
ourselves
,
"
stammered
Bumble
,
looking
apprehensively
about
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Cooling
yourselves
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Monks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
all
the
rain
that
ever
fell
,
or
ever
will
fall
,
will
put
as
much
of
hell
's
fire
out
,
as
a
man
can
carry
about
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
cool
yourself
so
easily
;
do
n't
think
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
agreeable
speech
,
Monks
turned
short
upon
the
matron
,
and
bent
his
gaze
upon
her
,
till
even
she
,
who
was
not
easily
cowed
,
was
fain
to
withdraw
her
eyes
,
and
turn
them
them
towards
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
woman
,
is
it
?
"
demanded
Monks
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
 
<EOS>
That
is
the
woman
,
"
replied
Mr
Bumble
,
mindful
of
his
wife
's
caution
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
think
women
never
can
keep
secrets
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
matron
,
interposing
,
and
returning
,
as
she
spoke
,
the
searching
look
of
Monks
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
they
will
always
keep
ONE
till
it
's
found
out
,
"
said
Monks
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
may
that
be
?
"
asked
the
matron
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
loss
of
their
own
good
name
,
"
replied
Monks
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
,
by
the
same
rule
,
if
a
woman
's
a
party
to
a
secret
that
might
hang
or
transport
her
,
I
'm
not
afraid
of
her
telling
it
to
anybody
;
not
I
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
,
mistress
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
rejoined
the
matron
,
slightly
colouring
as
she
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
do
n't
!
"
said
Monks
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
should
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Bestowing
something
half
-
way
between
a
smile
and
a
frown
upon
his
two
companions
,
and
again
beckoning
them
to
follow
him
,
the
man
hastened
across
the
apartment
,
which
was
of
considerable
extent
,
but
low
in
the
roof
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
preparing
to
ascend
a
steep
staircase
,
or
rather
ladder
,
leading
to
another
floor
of
warehouses
above
:
 
when
a
bright
flash
of
lightning
streamed
down
the
aperture
,
and
a
peal
of
thunder
followed
,
which
shook
the
crazy
building
to
its
centre
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hear
it
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
shrinking
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
it
!
 
<EOS>
Rolling
and
crashing
on
as
if
it
echoed
through
a
thousand
caverns
where
the
devils
were
hiding
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
the
sound
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
remained
silent
for
a
few
moments
;
and
then
,
removing
his
hands
suddenly
from
his
face
,
showed
,
to
the
unspeakable
discomposure
of
Mr
Bumble
,
that
it
was
much
distorted
and
discoloured
.
   
<EOS>
"
These
fits
come
over
me
,
now
and
then
,
"
said
Monks
,
observing
his
alarm
;
"
and
thunder
sometimes
brings
them
on
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
mind
me
now
;
it
's
all
over
for
this
once
.
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
speaking
,
he
led
the
way
up
the
ladder
;
and
hastily
closing
the
window
-
shutter
of
the
room
into
which
it
led
,
lowered
a
lantern
which
hung
at
the
end
of
a
rope
and
pulley
passed
through
one
of
the
heavy
beams
in
the
ceiling
:
 
and
which
cast
a
dim
light
upon
an
old
table
and
three
chairs
that
were
placed
beneath
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Monks
,
when
they
had
all
three
seated
themselves
,
"
the
sooner
we
come
to
our
business
,
the
better
for
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
woman
know
what
it
is
,
does
she
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
question
was
addressed
to
Bumble
;
but
his
wife
anticipated
the
reply
,
by
intimating
that
she
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
right
in
saying
that
you
were
with
this
hag
the
night
she
died
;
and
that
she
told
you
something
---
"
   
"
About
the
mother
of
the
boy
you
named
,
"
replied
the
matron
interrupting
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
first
question
is
,
of
what
nature
was
her
communication
?
"
said
Monks
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
second
,
"
observed
the
woman
with
much
deliberation
.
<EOS>
"
The
first
is
,
what
may
the
communication
be
worth
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
the
devil
can
tell
that
,
without
knowing
of
what
kind
it
is
?
"
asked
Monks
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nobody
better
than
you
<EOS>
,
I
am
persuaded
,
"
answered
Mrs
Bumble
:
who
did
not
want
for
spirit
,
as
her
yoke
-
fellow
could
abundantly
testify
.
   
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
said
Monks
significantly
,
and
with
a
look
of
eager
inquiry
;
"
there
may
be
money
's
worth
to
get
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
there
may
,
"
was
the
composed
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Something
that
was
taken
from
her
,
"
said
Monks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Something
that
she
wore
.
 
<EOS>
Something
that
---
"
   
"
You
had
better
bid
,
"
interrupted
Mrs
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
enough
,
already
,
to
assure
me
that
you
are
the
man
I
ought
to
talk
to
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
,
who
had
not
yet
been
admitted
by
his
better
half
into
any
greater
share
of
the
secret
than
he
had
originally
possessed
,
listened
to
this
dialogue
with
outstretched
neck
and
distended
eyes
:
 
which
he
directed
towards
his
wife
and
Monks
,
by
turns
,
in
undisguised
astonishment
;
increased
,
if
possible
,
when
the
latter
sternly
demanded
,
what
sum
was
required
for
the
disclosure
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
it
worth
to
you
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
woman
,
as
collectedly
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
nothing
;
it
may
be
twenty
pounds
,
"
replied
Monks
.
<EOS>
"
Speak
out
,
and
let
me
know
which
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Add
five
pounds
to
the
sum
you
have
named
;
give
me
five
-
and
-
twenty
pounds
in
gold
,
"
said
the
woman
;
"
and
I
'll
tell
you
all
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
Not
before
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Five
-
and
-
twenty
pounds
!
"
exclaimed
Monks
,
drawing
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
spoke
as
plainly
as
I
could
,
"
replied
Mrs
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
a
large
sum
,
either
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
large
sum
for
a
paltry
secret
,
that
may
be
nothing
when
it
's
told
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Monks
impatiently
;
"
and
which
has
been
lying
dead
for
twelve
years
past
or
more
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Such
matters
keep
well
,
and
,
like
good
wine
,
often
double
their
value
in
course
of
time
,
"
answered
the
matron
,
still
preserving
the
resolute
indifference
she
had
assumed
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
to
lying
dead
,
there
are
those
who
will
lie
dead
for
twelve
thousand
years
to
come
,
or
twelve
million
,
for
anything
you
or
<EOS>
I
know
,
who
will
tell
strange
tales
at
last
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
if
I
pay
it
for
nothing
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Monks
,
hesitating
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
easily
take
it
away
again
,
"
replied
the
matron
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
but
a
woman
;
alone
here
;
and
unprotected
.
"
   
"
Not
alone
,
my
dear
,
nor
unprotected
,
neither
,
"
submitted
Mr
Bumble
,
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
fear
:
"
\
I
\
am
here
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
And
besides
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
his
teeth
chattering
as
he
spoke
,
"
<EOS>
Mr
Monks
is
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
attempt
any
violence
on
porochial
persons
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Monks
is
aware
that
I
am
not
a
young
man
,
my
dear
,
and
also
that
I
am
a
little
run
to
seed
,
as
I
may
say
;
bu
he
has
heerd
:
 
I
say
I
have
no
doubt
Mr
Monks
has
heerd
,
my
dear
:
 
that
I
am
a
very
determined
officer
,
with
very
uncommon
strength
,
if
I
'm
once
roused
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
want
a
little
rousing
;
that
's
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Bumble
spoke
,
he
made
a
melancholy
feint
of
grasping
his
lantern
with
fierce
determination
;
and
plainly
showed
,
by
the
alarmed
expression
of
every
feature
,
that
he
DID
want
a
little
rousing
,
and
not
a
little
,
prior
to
making
any
very
warlike
demonstration
:
unless
,
indeed
,
against
paupers
,
or
other
person
or
persons
trained
down
for
the
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
fool
,
"
said
Mrs
Bumble
,
in
reply
;
"
and
had
better
hold
your
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
had
better
have
cut
it
out
,
before
he
came
,
if
he
ca
n't
speak
in
a
lower
tone
,
"
said
Monks
,
grimly
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
!
 
<EOS>
He
's
your
husband
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
my
husband
!
"
tittered
the
matron
,
parrying
the
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
as
much
,
when
you
came
in
,
"
rejoined
Monks
,
marking
the
angry
glance
which
the
lady
darted
at
her
spouse
as
she
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
better
;
I
have
less
hesitation
in
dealing
with
two
people
,
when
I
find
that
there
's
only
one
will
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
in
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
See
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
thrust
his
hand
into
a
side
-
pocket
;
and
producing
a
canvas
bag
,
told
out
twenty
-
five
sovereigns
on
the
table
,
and
pushed
them
over
to
the
woman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
he
said
,
"
gather
them
up
;
and
when
this
cursed
peal
of
thunder
,
which
I
feel
is
coming
up
to
break
over
the
house
-
top
,
is
gone
,
let
's
hear
your
story
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
thunder
,
which
seemed
in
fact
much
nearer
,
and
to
shiver
and
break
almost
over
their
heads
,
having
subsided
,
Monks
,
raising
his
face
from
the
table
,
bent
forward
to
listen
to
what
the
woman
should
say
.
 
<EOS>
The
faces
of
the
three
nearly
touched
,
as
the
two
men
leant
over
the
small
table
in
their
eagerness
to
hear
,
and
the
woman
also
leant
forward
to
render
her
whisper
audible
.
 
<EOS>
The
sickly
rays
of
the
suspended
lantern
falling
directly
upon
them
,
aggravated
the
paleness
and
anxiety
of
their
countenances
:
which
,
encircled
by
the
deepest
gloom
and
darkness
,
looked
ghastly
in
the
extreme
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
this
woman
,
that
we
called
old
Sally
,
died
,
"
the
matron
began
,
"
she
and
I
were
alone
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Was
there
no
one
by
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Monks
,
in
the
same
hollow
whisper
;
"
No
sick
wretch
or
idiot
in
some
other
bed
?
 
<EOS>
No
one
who
could
hear
,
and
might
,
by
possibility
,
understand
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
soul
,
"
replied
the
woman
;
"
we
were
alone
.
 
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
I
\
stood
alone
beside
the
body
when
death
came
over
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
,
"
said
Monks
,
regarding
her
attentively
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
spoke
of
a
young
creature
,
"
resumed
the
matron
,
"
who
had
brought
a
child
into
the
world
some
years
before
;
not
merely
in
the
same
room
,
but
in
the
same
bed
,
in
which
she
then
lay
dying
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
?
<EOS>
"
said
Monks
,
with
quivering
lip
,
and
glancing
over
his
shoulder
,
"
Blood
!
 
<EOS>
How
things
come
about
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
child
was
the
one
you
named
to
him
last
night
,
"
said
the
matron
,
nodding
carelessly
towards
her
husband
;
"
the
mother
this
nurse
had
robbed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
life
?
"
asked
Monks
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
death
,
"
replied
the
woman
,
with
something
like
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
stole
from
the
corpse
,
when
it
had
hardly
turned
to
one
,
that
which
the
dead
mother
had
prayed
her
,
with
her
last
breath
,
to
keep
for
the
infant
's
sake
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
sold
it
,
"
cried
Monks
,
with
desperate
eagerness
;
"
did
she
sell
it
?
 
<EOS>
Where
?
 
<EOS>
When
?
 
<EOS>
To
whom
?
 
<EOS>
How
long
before
?
"
   
"
As
she
told
me
,
with
great
difficulty
,
that
she
had
done
this
,
"
said
the
matron
,
"
she
fell
back
and
died
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Without
saying
more
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Monks
,
in
a
voice
which
,
from
its
very
suppression
,
seemed
only
the
more
furious
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
lie
!
<EOS>
I
'll
not
be
played
with
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tear
the
life
out
of
you
both
,
but
I
'll
know
what
it
was
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
did
n't
utter
another
word
,
"
said
the
woman
,
to
all
appearance
unmoved
(
as
Mr
Bumble
was
very
far
from
being
)
by
the
strange
man
's
violence
;
"
but
she
clutched
my
gown
,
violently
,
with
one
hand
,
which
was
partly
closed
;
and
when
I
saw
that
she
was
dead
,
and
so
removed
the
hand
by
force
<EOS>
,
I
found
it
clasped
a
scrap
of
dirty
paper
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Which
contained
---
"
interposed
Monks
,
stretching
forward
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
replied
the
woman
;
"
it
was
a
pawnbroker
's
duplicate
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
For
what
?
"
demanded
Monks
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
good
time
I
'll
tell
you
.
"
said
the
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
judge
that
she
had
kept
the
trinket
,
for
some
time
,
in
the
hope
of
turning
it
to
better
account
;
and
then
had
pawned
it
;
and
had
saved
or
scraped
together
money
to
pay
the
pawnbroker
's
interest
year
by
year
,
and
prevent
its
running
out
;
so
that
if
anything
came
of
it
,
it
could
still
be
redeemed
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
had
come
of
it
;
and
,
as
I
tell
you
,
she
died
with
the
scrap
of
paper
,
all
worn
and
tattered
,
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
The
time
was
out
in
two
days
;
I
thought
something
might
one
day
come
of
it
too
;
and
so
redeemed
the
pledge
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
is
it
now
?
"
asked
Monks
quickly
.
   
<EOS>
"
THERE
,
"
replied
the
woman
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
as
if
glad
to
be
relieved
of
it
,
she
hastily
threw
upon
the
table
a
small
kid
bag
scarcely
large
enough
for
a
French
watch
,
which
Monks
pouncing
upon
,
tore
open
with
trembling
hands
.
 
<EOS>
It
contained
a
little
gold
locket
:
in
which
were
two
locks
of
hair
,
and
a
plain
gold
wedding
-
ring
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
has
the
word
"
Agnes
"
engraved
on
the
inside
,
"
said
the
woman
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
blank
left
for
the
surname
;
and
then
follows
the
date
;
which
is
within
a
year
before
the
child
was
born
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
out
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
this
is
all
?
"
said
Monks
,
after
a
close
and
eager
scrutiny
of
the
contents
of
the
little
packet
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
,
"
replied
the
woman
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
drew
a
long
breath
,
as
if
he
were
glad
to
find
that
the
story
was
over
,
and
no
mention
made
of
taking
the
five
-
and
-
twenty
pounds
back
again
;
and
now
he
took
courage
to
wipe
the
perspiration
which
had
been
trickling
over
his
nose
,
unchecked
,
during
the
whole
of
the
previous
dialogue
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
the
story
,
beyond
what
I
can
guess
at
,
"
said
his
wife
addressing
Monks
,
after
a
short
silence
;
"
and
I
want
to
know
nothing
;
for
it
's
safer
<EOS>
not
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
may
ask
you
two
questions
,
<EOS>
may
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
ask
,
"
said
Monks
,
with
some
show
of
surprise
;
"
but
whether
I
answer
or
not
is
another
question
.
"
   
"
---
Which
makes
three
,
"
observed
Mr
Bumble
,
essaying
a
stroke
of
facetiousness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
what
you
expected
to
get
from
me
?
"
demanded
the
matron
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
Monks
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
other
question
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
propose
to
do
with
it
?
 
<EOS>
Can
it
be
used
against
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
rejoined
Monks
;
"
nor
against
me
either
.
 
<EOS>
See
here
!
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
move
a
step
forward
,
or
your
life
is
not
worth
a
bulrush
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
he
suddenly
wheeled
the
table
aside
,
and
pulling
an
iron
ring
in
the
boarding
,
threw
back
a
large
trap
-
door
which
opened
close
at
Mr
Bumble
's
feet
,
and
caused
that
gentleman
to
retire
several
paces
backward
,
with
great
precipitation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
down
,
"
said
Monks
,
lowering
the
lantern
into
the
gulf
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
fear
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
let
you
down
,
quietly
enough
,
when
you
were
seated
over
it
,
if
that
had
been
my
game
.
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
encouraged
,
the
matron
drew
near
to
the
brink
;
and
even
Mr
Bumble
himself
,
impelled
by
curiousity
,
ventured
to
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
The
turbid
water
,
swollen
by
the
heavy
rain
,
was
rushing
rapidly
on
below
;
and
all
other
sounds
were
lost
in
the
noise
of
its
plashing
and
eddying
against
the
green
and
slimy
piles
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
once
been
a
water
-
mill
beneath
;
the
tide
foaming
and
chafing
round
the
few
rotten
stakes
,
and
fragments
of
machinery
that
yet
remained
,
seemed
to
dart
onward
,
with
a
new
impulse
,
when
freed
from
the
obstacles
which
had
unavailingly
attempted
to
stem
its
headlong
course
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
flung
a
man
's
body
down
there
,
where
would
it
be
to
-
morrow
morning
?
"
said
Monks
,
swinging
the
lantern
to
and
fro
in
the
dark
well
.
   
<EOS>
"
Twelve
miles
down
the
river
,
and
cut
to
pieces
besides
,
"
replied
Bumble
,
recoiling
at
the
thought
.
   
<EOS>
Monks
drew
the
little
packet
from
his
breast
,
where
he
had
hurriedly
thrust
it
;
and
tying
it
to
a
leaden
weight
,
which
had
formed
a
part
of
some
pulley
,
and
was
lying
on
the
floor
,
dropped
it
into
the
stream
.
 
<EOS>
It
fell
straight
,
and
true
as
a
die
;
clove
the
water
with
a
scarcely
audible
splash
;
and
was
gone
.
   
<EOS>
The
three
looking
into
each
other
's
faces
,
seemed
to
breathe
more
freely
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
Monks
,
closing
the
trap
-
door
,
which
fell
heavily
back
into
its
former
position
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
the
sea
ever
gives
up
its
dead
,
as
books
say
it
will
,
it
will
keep
its
gold
and
silver
to
itself
,
and
that
trash
among
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
nothing
more
to
say
,
and
may
break
up
our
pleasant
party
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
,
"
observed
Mr
Bumble
,
with
great
alacrity
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
keep
a
quiet
tongue
in
your
head
,
will
you
?
"
said
Monks
,
with
a
threatening
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
afraid
of
your
wife
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
depend
upon
me
,
young
man
,
"
answered
Mr
Bumble
,
bowing
himself
gradually
towards
the
ladder
,
with
excessive
politeness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
everybody
's
account
,
young
man
;
on
my
own
,
you
know
,
Mr
Monks
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
,
for
your
sake
,
to
hear
it
,
"
remarked
Monks
.
<EOS>
"
Light
your
lantern
!
 
<EOS>
And
get
away
from
here
as
fast
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
fortunate
that
the
conversation
terminated
at
this
point
,
or
Mr
Bumble
,
who
had
bowed
himself
to
within
six
inches
of
the
ladder
,
would
infallibly
have
pitched
headlong
into
the
room
below
.
 
<EOS>
He
lighted
his
lantern
from
that
which
Monks
had
detached
from
the
rope
,
and
now
carried
in
his
hand
;
and
making
no
effort
to
prolong
the
discourse
,
descended
in
silence
,
followed
by
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
Monks
brought
up
the
rear
,
after
pausing
on
the
steps
to
satisfy
himself
that
there
were
no
other
sounds
to
be
heard
than
the
beating
of
the
rain
without
,
and
the
rushing
of
the
water
.
   
<EOS>
They
traversed
the
lower
room
,
slowly
,
and
with
caution
;
for
Monks
started
at
every
shadow
;
and
Mr
Bumble
,
holding
his
lantern
a
foot
above
the
ground
,
walked
not
only
with
remarkable
care
,
but
with
a
marvellously
light
step
for
a
gentleman
of
his
figure
:
 
looking
nervously
about
him
for
hidden
trap
-
doors
.
 
<EOS>
The
gate
at
which
they
had
entered
,
was
softly
unfastened
and
opened
by
Monks
;
merely
exchanging
a
nod
with
their
mysterious
acquaintance
,
the
married
couple
emerged
into
the
wet
and
darkness
outside
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
no
sooner
gone
,
than
Monks
,
who
appeared
to
entertain
an
invincible
repugnance
to
being
left
alone
,
<EOS>
called
to
a
boy
who
had
been
hidden
somewhere
below
.
<EOS>
Bidding
him
go
first
,
and
bear
the
light
,
he
returned
to
the
chamber
he
had
just
quitted
.

Chapter
39
.
<EOS>
Introduces
some
respectable
characters
with
whom
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
,
and
shows
how
Monks
and
the
Jew
laid
their
worthy
heads
together
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
evening
following
that
upon
which
the
three
worthies
mentioned
in
the
last
chapter
,
disposed
of
their
little
matter
of
business
as
therein
narrated
,
Mr
William
Sikes
,
awakening
from
a
nap
,
drowsily
growled
forth
an
inquiry
what
time
of
night
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
The
room
in
which
Mr
Sikes
propounded
this
question
,
was
not
one
of
those
he
had
tenanted
,
previous
to
the
Chertsey
expedition
,
although
it
was
in
the
same
quarter
of
the
town
,
and
was
situated
at
no
great
distance
from
his
former
lodgings
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
,
in
appearance
,
so
desirable
a
habitation
as
his
old
quarters
:
 
<EOS>
being
a
mean
and
badly
-
furnished
apartment
,
of
very
limited
size
;
lighted
only
by
one
small
window
in
the
shelving
roof
,
and
abutting
on
a
close
and
dirty
lane
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
were
there
wanting
other
indications
of
the
good
gentleman
's
having
gone
down
in
the
world
of
late
:
 
for
a
great
scarcity
of
furniture
,
and
total
absence
of
comfort
,
together
with
the
disappearance
of
all
such
small
moveables
as
spare
clothes
and
linen
,
bespoke
a
state
of
extreme
poverty
;
while
the
meagre
and
attenuated
condition
of
Mr
Sikes
himself
would
have
fully
confirmed
these
symptoms
,
if
they
had
stood
in
any
need
of
corroboration
.
   
<EOS>
The
housebreaker
was
lying
on
the
bed
,
wrapped
in
his
white
great
-
coat
,
by
way
of
dressing
-
gown
,
and
displaying
a
set
of
features
in
no
degree
improved
by
the
cadaverous
hue
of
illness
,
and
the
addition
of
a
soiled
nightcap
,
and
a
stiff
,
black
beard
of
a
week
's
growth
.
 
<EOS>
The
dog
sat
at
the
bedside
:
 
now
eyeing
his
master
with
a
wistful
look
,
and
now
pricking
his
ears
,
and
uttering
a
low
growl
as
some
noise
in
the
street
,
or
in
the
lower
part
of
the
house
,
attracted
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>
Seated
by
the
window
,
busily
engaged
in
patching
an
old
waistcoat
which
formed
a
portion
of
the
robber
's
ordinary
dress
,
was
a
female
:
 
so
pale
and
reduced
with
watching
and
privation
,
that
there
would
have
been
considerable
difficulty
in
recognising
her
as
the
same
Nancy
who
has
already
figured
in
this
tale
,
but
for
the
voice
in
which
she
replied
to
Mr
Sikes
's
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
long
gone
seven
,
"
said
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
feel
to
-
night
,
Bill
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
weak
as
water
,
"
replied
Mr
Sikes
,
with
an
imprecation
on
his
eyes
and
limbs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
;
lend
us
a
hand
,
and
let
me
get
off
this
thundering
bed
anyhow
.
"
   
<EOS>
Illness
had
not
improved
Mr
Sikes
's
temper
;
for
,
as
the
girl
raised
him
up
and
led
him
to
a
chair
,
he
muttered
various
curses
on
her
awkwardnewss
,
and
struck
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Whining
are
you
?
"
said
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
stand
snivelling
there
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
ca
n't
do
anything
better
than
that
,
cut
off
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
D'ye
hear
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hear
you
,
"
replied
the
girl
,
turning
her
face
aside
,
and
forcing
a
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
fancy
have
you
got
in
your
head
now
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
've
thought
better
of
it
,
have
you
?
"
<EOS>
growled
Sikes
,
marking
the
tear
which
trembled
in
her
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
the
better
for
you
,
you
have
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
,
you
'd
be
hard
upon
me
to
-
night
,
Bill
,
"
said
the
girl
,
laying
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
cried
Mr
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Such
a
number
of
nights
,
"
said
the
girl
,
with
a
touch
of
woman
's
tenderness
,
which
communicated
something
like
sweetness
of
tone
,
even
to
her
voice
:
"
such
a
number
of
nights
as
I
've
been
patient
with
you
,
nursing
and
caring
for
you
,
as
if
you
had
been
a
child
:
and
this
the
first
that
I
've
seen
you
like
yourself
;
you
would
n't
have
served
me
as
you
did
just
now
,
if
you
'd
thought
of
that
,
would
you
?
 
<EOS>
Come
,
come
;
say
you
would
n't
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Sikes
,
"
I
would
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
damme
,
now
,
the
girls
's
whining
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
nothing
,
"
said
the
girl
,
throwing
herself
into
a
chair
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
seem
to
mind
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
'll
soon
be
over
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
'll
be
over
?
"
demanded
Mr
Sikes
in
a
savage
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
foolery
are
you
up
to
,
now
,
again
?
 
<EOS>
Get
up
and
bustle
about
,
and
do
n't
come
over
me
with
your
woman
's
nonsense
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
any
other
time
,
this
remonstrance
,
and
the
tone
in
which
it
was
delivered
,
would
have
had
the
desired
effect
;
but
the
girl
being
really
weak
and
exhausted
,
dropped
her
head
over
the
back
of
the
chair
,
and
fainted
,
before
Mr
Sikes
could
get
out
a
few
of
the
appropriate
oaths
with
which
,
on
similar
occasions
,
he
was
accustomed
to
garnish
his
threats
.
 
<EOS>
Not
knowing
,
very
well
,
what
to
do
,
in
this
uncommon
emergency
;
for
Miss
Nancy
's
hysterics
were
usually
of
that
violent
kind
which
the
patient
fights
and
struggles
out
of
,
without
much
assistance
;
Mr
Sikes
tried
a
little
blasphemy
:
and
finding
that
mode
of
treatment
wholly
ineffectual
,
called
for
assistance
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
here
,
my
dear
?
"
said
Fagin
,
looking
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lend
a
hand
to
the
girl
,
ca
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
replied
Sikes
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
stand
chattering
and
grinning
at
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
an
exclamation
of
surprise
,
Fagin
hastened
to
the
girl
's
assistance
,
while
Mr
John
Dawkins
(
otherwise
the
Artful
Dodger
)
,
who
had
followed
his
venerable
friend
into
the
room
,
hastily
deposited
on
the
floor
a
bundle
with
which
he
was
laden
;
and
snatching
a
bottle
from
the
grasp
of
Master
Charles
Bates
who
came
close
at
his
heels
,
uncorked
it
in
a
twinkling
with
his
teeth
,
and
poured
a
portion
of
its
contents
down
the
patient
's
throat
:
 
previously
taking
a
taste
,
himself
,
to
prevent
mistakes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Give
her
a
whiff
of
fresh
air
with
the
bellows
,
Charley
,
"
said
Mr
Dawkins
;
"
and
you
slap
her
hands
,
Fagin
,
while
Bill
undoes
the
petticuts
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
These
united
restoratives
,
administered
with
great
energy
:
especially
that
department
consigned
to
Master
Bates
,
who
appeared
to
consider
his
share
in
the
proceedings
,
a
piece
of
unexampled
pleasantry
:
 
were
not
long
in
producing
the
desired
effect
.
 
<EOS>
The
girl
gradually
recovered
her
senses
;
and
,
staggering
to
a
chair
by
the
bedside
,
hid
her
face
upon
the
pillow
:
 
leaving
Mr
Sikes
to
confront
the
new
comers
,
in
some
astonishment
at
their
unlooked
-
for
appearance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
evil
wind
has
blowed
you
here
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
Fagin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
evil
wind
at
all
,
my
dear
,
for
evil
winds
blow
nobody
any
good
;
and
I
've
brought
something
good
with
me
,
that
you
'll
be
glad
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
Dodger
,
my
dear
,
open
the
bundle
;
and
give
Bill
the
little
trifles
that
we
spent
all
our
money
on
,
this
morning
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
compliance
with
Mr
Fagin
's
request
,
the
Artful
untied
this
bundle
,
which
was
of
large
size
,
and
formed
of
an
old
table
-
cloth
;
and
handed
the
articles
it
contained
,
one
by
one
,
to
Charley
Bates
:
who
placed
them
on
the
table
,
with
various
encomiums
on
their
rarity
and
excellence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sitch
a
rabbit
pie
,
Bill
,
"
exclaimed
that
young
gentleman
,
disclosing
to
view
a
huge
pasty
;
"
sitch
delicate
creeturs
,
with
sitch
tender
limbs
,
Bill
,
that
the
wery
bones
melt
in
your
mouth
,
and
there
's
no
occasion
to
pick
'em
;
half
a
pound
of
seven
and
six
-
penny
green
,
<EOS>
so
precious
strong
that
if
you
mix
it
with
biling
water
,
it
'll
go
nigh
to
blow
the
lid
of
the
tea
-
pot
off
;
a
pound
and
a
half
of
moist
sugar
that
the
niggers
did
n't
work
at
all
at
,
afore
they
got
it
up
to
sitch
a
pitch
of
goodness
,
---
<EOS>
oh
no

<EOS>
Two
half

quartern
brans
;
pound
of

piece
of
double
Glo'ster
;
and
,
to
wind
up
all
,
some
of
the
richest
sort
you
ever
lushed
!
"
   
<EOS>
Uttering
this
last
panegyrie
,
Master
Bates
produced
,
from
one
of
his
extensive
pockets
,
a
full
-
sized
wine
-
bottle
,
carefully
corked
;
while
Mr
Dawkins
,
at
the
same
instant
,
poured
out
a
wine
-
glassful
of
raw
spirits
from
the
bottle
he
carried
:
 
which
the
invalid
tossed
down
his
throat
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Fagin
,
rubbing
his
hands
with
great
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
do
,
Bill
;
you
'll
do
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mr
Sikes
;
"
I
might
have
been
done
for
,
twenty
times
over
,
afore
you
'd
have
done
anything
to
help
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
by
leaving
a
man
in
this
state
,
three
weeks
and
more
,
you
false
-
hearted
wagabond
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
hear
him
,
boys
!
"
said
Fagin
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
"
<EOS>
And
us
come
to
bring
him
all
these
beau
-
ti
-
ful
things
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
things
is
well
enough
in
their
way
,
"
observed
Mr
Sikes
:
 
a
little
soothed
as
he
glanced
over
the
table
;
"
but
what
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
,
why
you
should
leave
me
here
,
down
in
the
mouth
,
health
,
blunt
,
and
everything
else
;
and
take
no
more
notice
of
me
,
all
this
mortal
time
,
than
if
I
was
that
'
ere
dog
.
---
Drive
him
down
,
Charley
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
such
a
jolly
dog
as
that
,
"
cried
Master
Bates
,
doing
as
he
was
desired
.
 
<EOS>
"
Smelling
the
grub
like
a
old
lady
a
going
to
market
!
 
<EOS>
He
'd
make
his
fortun
"
on
the
stage
that
dog
would
,
and
rewive
the
drayma
besides
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
din
,
"
cried
Sikes
,
as
the
dog
retreated
under
the
bed
:
   
still
growling
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
,
you
withered
old
fence
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
away
from
London
,
a
week
and
more
,
my
dear
,
on
a
plant
,
"
replied
the
Jew
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
about
the
other
fortnight
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
about
the
other
fortnight
that
you
've
left
me
lying
here
,
like
a
sick
rat
in
his
hole
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
help
it
,
Bill
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
go
into
a
long
explanation
before
company
;
but
I
could
n't
help
it
,
upon
my
honour
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
your
what
?
"
growled
Sikes
,
with
excessive
disgust
.
"
<EOS>
Here
!
<EOS>
Cut
me
off
a
piece
of
that
pie
,
one
of
you
boys
,
to
take
the
taste
of
that
out
of
my
mouth
,
or
it
'll
choke
me
dead
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
out
of
temper
,
my
dear
,
"
urged
Fagin
,
submissively
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
forgot
you
,
Bill
;
never
once
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
pound
it
that
you
han't
,
"
replied
Sikes
,
with
a
bitter
grin
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
been
scheming
and
plotting
away
,
every
hour
that
I
have
laid
shivering
and
burning
here
;
and
Bill
was
to
do
this
;
and
Bill
was
to
do
that
;
and
Bill
was
to
do
it
all
,
<EOS>
dirt
cheap
,
as
soon
as
he
got
well
:
and
was
quite
poor
enough
for
your
work
.
<EOS>
If
it
had
n't
been
for
the
girl
,
I
might
have
died
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
now
,
Bill
,
"
remonstrated
Fagin
,
eagerly
catching
at
the
word
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
it
had
n't
been
for
the
girl
!
 
<EOS>
Who
but
poor
<EOS>
ould
<EOS>
Fagin
was
the
means
of
your
having
such
a
handy
girl
about
you
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
says
true
enough
there
!
"
<EOS>
said
Nancy
,
coming
hastily
forward
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
him
be
;
let
him
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nancy
's
appearance
gave
a
new
turn
to
the
conversation
;
for
the
boys
,
receiving
a
sly
wink
from
the
wary
old
Jew
,
began
to
ply
her
with
liquor
:
of
which
,
however
,
she
took
very
sparingly
;
while
Fagin
,
assuming
an
unusual
flow
of
spirits
,
gradually
brought
Mr
Sikes
into
a
better
temper
,
by
affecting
to
regard
his
threats
as
a
little
pleasant
banter
;
and
,
moreover
,
by
laughing
very
heartily
at
one
or
two
rough
jokes
,
which
,
after
repeated
applications
to
the
spirit
-
bottle
,
he
condescended
to
make
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
very
well
,
"
said
Mr
Sikes
;
"
but
I
must
have
some
blunt
from
you
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
a
piece
of
coin
about
me
,
"
replied
the
Jew
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
've
got
lots
at
home
,
"
retorted
Sikes
;
"
and
I
must
have
some
from
there
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lots
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Fagin
,
holding
up
is
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
so
much
as
would
---
"
   
"
I
do
n't
know
how
much
you
've
got
,
and
I
dare
say
you
hardly
know
yourself
,
as
it
would
take
a
pretty
long
time
to
count
it
,
"
said
Sikes
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
must
have
some
to
-
night
;
and
that
's
flat
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
said
Fagin
,
with
a
sigh
,
"
I
'll
send
the
Artful
round
presently
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
do
nothing
of
the
kind
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Sikes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Artful
's
a
deal
too
artful
,
and
would
forget
to
come
,
or
lose
his
way
,
or
get
dodged
by
traps
and
so
be
perwented
,
or
anything
for
an
excuse
,
if
you
put
him
up
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nancy
shall
go
to
the
ken
and
fetch
it
,
to
make
all
sure
;
and
I
'll
lie
down
and
have
a
snooze
while
she
's
gone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
great
deal
of
haggling
and
squabbling
,
Fagin
beat
down
the
amount
of
the
required
advance
from
five
pounds
to
three
pounds
four
and
sixpence
:
protesting
with
many
solemn
asseverations
that
that
would
only
leave
him
eighteen
-
pence
to
keep
house
with
;
Mr
Sikes
sullenly
remarking
that
if
he
could
n't
get
any
more
he
must
accompany
him
home
;
with
the
Dodger
and
Master
Bates
put
the
eatables
in
the
cupboard
.
 
<EOS>
The
Jew
then
,
taking
leave
of
his
affectionate
friend
,
returned
homeward
,
attended
by
Nancy
and
the
boys
:
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sikes
,
meanwhile
,
flinging
himself
on
the
bed
,
and
composing
himself
to
sleep
away
the
time
until
the
young
lady
's
return
.
   
<EOS>
In
due
course
,
they
arrived
at
Fagin
's
abode
,
where
they
found
Toby
Crackit
and
Mr
Chitling
intent
upon
their
fifteenth
game
at
cribbage
,
which
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
the
latter
gentleman
lost
,
and
with
it
,
his
fifteenth
and
last
sixpence
:
much
to
the
amusement
of
his
young
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Crackit
,
apparently
somewhat
ashamed
at
being
found
relaxing
himself
with
a
gentleman
so
much
<EOS>
his
inferior
in
station
and
mental
endowments
,
yawned
,
and
inquiring
after
Sikes
,
took
up
his
hat
to
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
Has
nobody
been
,
Toby
?
"
asked
Fagin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
living
leg
,
"
answered
Mr
Crackit
,
pulling
up
his
collar
;
"
it
's
been
as
dull
as
swipes
.
 
<EOS>
You
ought
to
stand
something
handsome
,
Fagin
,
to
recompense
me
for
keeping
house
so
long
.
<EOS>
Damme
,
I
'm
as
flat
as
a
juryman
;
and
should
have
gone
to
sleep
,
as
fast
as
Newgate
,
if
I
had
n't
had
the
good
natur
"
to
amuse
this
youngster
.
 
<EOS>
Horrid
dull
,
I
'm
blessed
if
I
an't
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
and
other
ejaculations
of
the
same
kind
,
Mr
Toby
Crackit
swept
up
his
winnings
,
and
crammed
them
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
with
a
haughty
air
,
as
though
such
small
pieces
of
silver
were
wholly
beneath
the
consideration
of
a
man
of
his
figure
;
this
done
,
he
swaggered
out
of
the
room
,
with
so
much
elegance
and
gentility
,
that
Mr
Chitling
,
bestowing
numerous
admiring
glances
on
his
legs
and
boots
till
they
were
out
of
sight
,
assured
the
company
that
he
considered
his
acquaintance
cheap
at
fifteen
sixpences
an
interview
,
and
that
he
did
n't
value
his
losses
the
snap
of
his
little
finger
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
a
rum
chap
you
are
,
Tom
!
"
said
Master
Bates
,
highly
amused
by
this
declaration
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
"
replied
Mr
Chitling
.
 
<EOS>
"
Am
I
,
Fagin
?
"
   
"
A
very
clever
fellow
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Fagin
,
patting
him
on
the
shoulder
,
and
winking
to
his
other
pupils
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
Mr
Crackit
is
a
heavy
swell
;
an't
he
,
Fagin
?
"
asked
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
doubt
at
all
of
that
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
it
is
a
creditable
thing
to
have
his
acquaintance
;
an't
it
,
Fagin
?
<EOS>
"
pursued
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
much
so
,
indeed
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
They
're
only
jealous
,
Tom
,
because
he
wo
n't
give
it
to
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tom
,
triumphantly
,
"
that
's
where
it
is
!
 
<EOS>
He
has
cleaned
me
out
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
can
go
and
earn
some
more
,
when
I
like
;
ca
n't
I
,
Fagin
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
you
can
,
and
the
sooner
you
go
the
better
,
Tom
;
so
make
up
your
loss
at
once
,
and
do
n't
lose
any
more
time
.
 
<EOS>
Dodger
!
   
Charley
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
time
you
were
on
the
lay
.
 
<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
near
ten
,
and
nothing
done
yet
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
In
obedience
to
this
hint
,
the
boys
,
nodding
to
Nancy
,
took
up
their
hats
,
and
left
the
room
;
the
Dodger
and
his
vivacious
friend
indulging
,
as
they
went
,
in
many
witticisms
at
the
expense
of
Mr
Chitling
;
in
whose
conduct
,
it
is
but
justice
to
say
,
there
was
nothing
very
conspicuous
or
peculiar
:
 
inasmuch
as
there
are
a
great
number
of
spirited
young
bloods
upon
town
,
who
pay
a
much
higher
price
than
Mr
Chitling
for
being
seen
in
good
society
:
 
and
a
great
number
of
fine
gentlemen
(
composing
the
good
society
aforesaid
)
who
established
their
reputation
upon
very
much
the
same
footing
as
flash
Toby
Crackit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Fagin
,
when
they
had
left
the
room
,
"
I
'll
go
and
get
you
that
cash
,
Nancy
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
only
the
key
of
a
little
cupboard
where
I
keep
a
few
odd
things
the
boys
get
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
lock
up
my
money
,
for
I
've
got
none
to
lock
up
,
<EOS>
my
dear
---
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
---
none
to
lock
up
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
poor
trade
,
Nancy
,
and
no
thanks
;
but
I
'm
fond
of
seeing
the
young
people
about
me
;
and
I
bear
it
all
<EOS>
,
I
bear
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
hastily
concealing
the
key
in
his
breast
;
"
who
's
that
?
 
<EOS>
Listen
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
girl
,
who
was
sitting
at
the
table
with
her
arms
folded
,
appeared
in
no
way
interested
in
the
arrival
:
or
to
care
whether
the
person
,
whoever
he
was
,
came
or
went
:
 
until
the
murmur
of
a
man
's
voice
reached
her
ears
.
 
<EOS>
The
instant
<EOS>
she
caught
the
sound
,
she
tore
off
her
bonnet
and
shawl
,
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
,
and
thrust
them
under
the
table
.
<EOS>
The
Jew
,
turning
round
immediately
afterwards
,
she
muttered
a
complaint
of
the
heat
:
 
in
a
tone
of
languor
that
contrasted
,
very
remarkably
,
with
the
extreme
haste
and
violence
of
this
action
:
 
which
,
however
,
had
been
unobserved
by
Fagin
,
who
had
his
back
towards
her
at
the
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
"
<EOS>
he
whispered
,
as
though
nettled
by
the
interruption
;
"
it
's
the
man
I
expected
before
;
he
's
coming
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
word
about
the
money
while
he
's
here
,
Nance
.
 
<EOS>
He
wo
n't
stop
long
.
 
<EOS>
Not
ten
minutes
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Laying
his
skinny
forefinger
upon
his
lip
,
the
Jew
carried
a
candle
to
the
door
,
as
a
man
's
step
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
without
.
 
<EOS>
He
reached
it
,
at
the
same
moment
as
the
visitor
,
who
,
coming
hastily
into
the
room
,
was
close
upon
the
girl
before
he
observed
her
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
Monks
.
   
<EOS>
"
Only
one
of
my
young
people
,
"
said
Fagin
,
observing
that
Monks
drew
back
,
on
beholding
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
move
,
Nancy
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
girl
drew
closer
to
the
table
,
and
glancing
at
Monks
with
an
air
of
careless
levity
,
withdrew
her
eyes
;
but
as
he
turned
towards
Fagin
,
she
stole
another
look
;
so
keen
and
searching
,
and
full
of
purpose
,
that
if
there
had
been
any
bystander
to
observe
the
change
,
he
could
hardly
have
believed
the
two
looks
to
have
proceeded
from
the
same
person
.
   
<EOS>
"
Any
news
?
"
inquired
Fagin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Great
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
---
and
---
good
?
"
asked
Fagin
,
hesitating
as
though
he
feared
to
vex
the
other
man
by
being
too
sanguine
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
bad
,
any
way
,
"
replied
Monks
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
prompt
enough
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
have
a
word
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
girl
drew
closer
to
the
table
,
and
made
no
offer
to
leave
the
room
,
although
she
could
see
that
Monks
was
pointing
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
Jew
:
 
perhaps
fearing
she
might
say
something
aloud
about
the
money
,
if
he
endeavoured
to
get
rid
of
her
:
 
pointed
upward
,
and
took
Monks
out
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
that
infernal
hole
we
were
in
before
,
"
she
could
hear
the
man
say
as
they
went
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
Fagin
laughed
;
and
making
some
reply
which
did
not
reach
her
,
seemed
,
by
the
creaking
of
the
boards
,
to
lead
his
companion
to
the
second
story
.
   
<EOS>
Before
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
had
ceased
to
echo
through
the
house
,
the
girl
had
slipped
off
her
shoes
;
and
drawing
her
gown
loosely
over
her
head
,
and
muffling
her
arms
in
it
,
stood
at
the
door
,
listening
with
breathless
interest
.
 
<EOS>
The
moment
the
noise
ceased
,
she
glided
from
the
room
;
ascended
the
stairs
with
incredible
softness
and
silence
;
and
was
lost
in
the
gloom
above
.
   
<EOS>
The
room
remained
deserted
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
more
;
the
girl
glided
back
with
the
same
unearthly
tread
;
and
,
immediately
afterwards
,
the
two
men
were
heard
descending
.
 
<EOS>
Monks
went
at
once
into
the
street
;
and
the
Jew
crawled
upstairs
again
for
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
returned
,
the
girl
was
adjusting
her
shawl
and
bonnet
,
as
if
preparing
to
be
gone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Nance
!
,
"
exclaimed
the
Jew
,
starting
back
as
he
put
down
the
candle
,
"
how
pale
you
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pale
!
"
echoed
the
girl
,
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hands
,
as
if
to
look
steadily
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
horrible
.
 
<EOS>
What
have
you
been
doing
to
yourself
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
that
I
know
of
,
except
sitting
in
this
close
place
for
I
do
n't
know
how
long
and
all
,
"
replied
the
girl
carelessly
.
<EOS>
"
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
get
back
;
that
's
a
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
a
sigh
for
every
piece
of
money
,
Fagin
told
the
amount
into
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
They
parted
without
more
conversation
,
merely
interchanging
a
"
good
-
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
When
the
girl
got
into
the
open
street
,
she
sat
down
upon
a
doorstep
;
and
seemed
,
for
a
few
moments
,
wholly
bewildered
and
unable
to
pursue
her
way
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
she
arose
;
and
hurrying
on
,
in
a
direction
quite
opposite
to
that
in
which
Sikes
was
awaiting
her
returned
,
quickened
her
pace
,
until
it
gradually
resolved
into
a
violent
run
.
 
<EOS>
After
completely
exhausting
herself
,
she
stopped
to
take
breath
:
 
and
,
as
if
suddenly
recollecting
herself
,
and
deploring
her
inability
to
do
something
she
was
bent
upon
,
wrung
her
hands
,
and
burst
into
tears
.
   
<EOS>
It
might
be
that
her
tears
relieved
her
,
or
that
she
felt
the
full
hopelessness
of
her
condition
;
but
she
turned
back
;
and
hurrying
with
nearly
as
great
rapidity
in
the
contrary
direction
;
partly
to
recover
lost
time
,
and
partly
to
keep
pace
with
the
violent
current
of
her
own
thoughts
:
 
soon
reached
the
dwelling
where
she
had
left
the
housebreaker
.
   
<EOS>
If
she
betrayed
any
agitation
,
when
she
presented
herself
to
Mr
Sikes
,
he
did
not
observe
it
;
for
merely
inquiring
if
she
had
brought
the
money
,
and
receiving
a
reply
in
the
affirmative
,
he
uttered
a
growl
of
satisfaction
,
and
replacing
his
head
upon
the
pillow
,
resumed
the
slumbers
which
her
arrival
had
interrupted
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
fortunate
for
her
that
the
possession
of
money
occasioned
him
so
much
employment
next
day
in
the
way
of
eating
and
drinking
;
and
withal
had
so
beneficial
an
effect
in
smoothing
down
the
asperities
of
his
temper
;
that
he
had
neither
time
nor
inclination
to
be
very
critical
upon
her
behaviour
and
deportment
.
 
<EOS>
That
she
had
all
the
abstracted
and
nervous
manner
of
one
who
is
on
the
eve
of
some
bold
and
hazardous
step
,
which
it
has
required
no
common
struggle
to
resolve
upon
,
would
have
been
obvious
to
the
lynx
-
eyed
Fagin
,
who
would
most
probably
have
taken
the
alarm
at
once
;
but
Mr
Sikes
lacking
the
niceties
of
discrimination
,
and
being
troubled
with
no
more
subtle
misgivings
than
those
which
resolve
themselves
into
a
dogged
roughness
of
behaviour
towards
everybody
;
and
being
,
furthermore
,
in
an
unusually
amiable
condition
,
as
has
been
already
observed
;
saw
nothing
unusual
in
her
demeanor
,
and
indeed
,
troubled
himself
so
little
about
her
,
that
,
had
her
agitation
been
far
more
perceptible
than
it
was
,
it
would
have
been
very
unlikely
to
have
awakened
his
suspicions
.
   
<EOS>
As
that
day
closed
in
,
the
girl
's
excitement
increased
;
and
,
when
night
came
on
,
and
she
sat
by
,
watching
until
the
housebreaker
should
drink
himself
asleep
,
there
was
an
unusual
paleness
in
her
cheek
,
and
a
fire
in
her
eye
,
that
even
Sikes
observed
with
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sikes
being
weak
from
the
fever
,
was
lying
in
bed
,
taking
hot
water
with
his
gin
to
render
it
less
inflammatory
;
and
had
pushed
his
glass
towards
Nancy
to
be
replenished
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
,
when
these
symptoms
first
struck
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
burn
my
body
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
man
,
raising
himself
on
his
hands
as
he
stared
the
girl
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
look
like
a
corpse
come
to
life
again
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Matter
!
"
replied
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
look
at
me
so
hard
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
foolery
is
this
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Sikes
,
grasping
her
by
the
arm
,
and
shaking
her
roughly
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
thinking
of
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
many
things
,
Bill
,
"
replied
the
girl
,
shivering
,
and
as
she
did
so
,
pressing
her
hands
upon
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
Lord
!
 
<EOS>
What
odds
in
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
tone
of
forced
gaiety
in
which
the
last
words
were
spoken
,
seemd
to
produce
a
deeper
impression
on
Sikes
than
the
wild
and
rigid
look
which
had
preceded
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
wot
<EOS>
it
is
,
"
said
Sikes
;
"
if
you
have
n't
caught
the
fever
,
and
got
it
comin
'
<EOS>
on
,
now
,
there
's
something
more
than
usual
in
the
wind
,
and
something
dangerous
too
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
not
a
-
going
to
---
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
damme
!
<EOS>
you
would
n't
do
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
what
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
girl
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
ai
n't
,
"
said
Sikes
,
fixing
his
eyes
upon
her
,
and
muttering
the
words
to
himself
;
"
there
ai
n't
a
stauncher
-
hearted
gal
going
,
or
I
'd
have
cut
her
throat
three
months
ago
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
got
the
fever
coming
on
;
that
's
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Fortifying
himself
with
this
assurance
,
Sikes
drained
the
glass
to
the
bottom
,
and
then
,
with
many
grumbling
oaths
,
called
for
his
physic
.
 
<EOS>
The
girl
jumped
up
,
with
great
alacrity
;
poured
it
quickly
out
,
but
with
her
back
towards
him
;
and
held
the
vessel
to
his
lips
,
while
he
drank
off
the
contents
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
the
robber
,
"
come
and
sit
aside
of
me
,
and
put
on
your
own
face
;
or
I
'll
alter
it
so
,
that
you
wo
n't
know
it
agin
when
you
do
want
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
girl
obeyed
.
 
<EOS>
Sikes
,
locking
her
hand
in
his
,
fell
back
upon
the
pillow
:
turning
his
eyes
upon
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
They
closed
;
opened
again
;
closed
once
more
;
again
opened
.
 
<EOS>
He
shifted
his
position
restlessly
;
and
,
after
dozing
again
,
and
again
,
for
two
or
three
minutes
,
and
as
often
springing
up
with
a
look
of
terror
,
and
gazing
vacantly
about
him
,
was
suddenly
stricken
,
as
it
were
,
while
in
the
very
attitude
of
rising
,
into
a
deep
and
heavy
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
The
grasp
of
his
hand
relaxed
;
the
upraised
arm
fell
languidly
by
his
side
;
and
he
lay
like
one
in
a
profound
trance
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
laudanum
has
taken
effect
at
last
,
"
murmured
the
girl
,
as
she
rose
from
the
bedside
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
may
be
too
late
,
even
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
hastily
dressed
herself
in
her
bonnet
and
shawl
:
 
looking
fearfully
round
,
from
time
to
time
,
as
if
,
despite
the
sleeping
draught
,
she
expected
every
moment
to
feel
the
pressure
of
Sikes
's
heavy
hand
upon
her
shoulder
;
then
,
stooping
softly
over
the
bed
,
she
kissed
the
robber
's
lips
;
and
then
opening
and
closing
the
room
-
door
with
noiseless
touch
,
hurried
from
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
A
watchman
was
crying
half
-
past
nine
,
down
a
dark
passage
through
which
she
had
to
pass
,
in
gaining
the
main
thoroughfare
.
   
<EOS>
"
Has
it
long
gone
the
half
-
hour
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
girl
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
'll
strike
the
hour
in
another
quarter
,
"
said
the
man
:
raising
his
lantern
to
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
can
not
get
there
in
less
than
an
hour
or
more
,
"
muttered
Nancy
:
 
<EOS>
brushing
swiftly
past
him
,
and
gliding
rapidly
down
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
Many
of
the
shops
were
already
closing
in
the
back
lanes
and
avenues
through
which
she
tracked
her
way
,
in
making
from
Spitalfields
towards
the
West
-
End
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
The
clock
struck
ten
,
increasing
her
impatience
.
 
<EOS>
She
tore
along
the
narrow
pavement
:
 
<EOS>
elbowing
the
passengers
from
side
to
side
;
and
darting
almost
under
the
horses
'
heads
,
crossed
crowded
streets
,
where
clusters
of
persons
were
eagerly
watching
their
opportunity
to
do
the
like
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
woman
is
mad
!
"
said
the
people
,
turning
to
look
after
her
as
she
rushed
away
.
   
<EOS>
When
she
reached
the
more
wealthy
quarter
of
the
town
,
the
streets
were
comparatively
deserted
;
and
here
her
headlong
progress
excited
a
still
greater
curiosity
in
the
stragglers
whom
she
hurried
past
.
 
<EOS>
Some
quickened
their
pace
behind
,
as
though
to
see
whither
she
was
hastening
at
such
an
unusual
rate
;
and
a
few
made
head
upon
her
,
and
looked
back
,
surprised
at
her
undiminished
speed
;
but
they
fell
off
one
by
one
;
and
when
she
neared
her
place
of
destination
,
she
was
alone
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
family
hotel
in
a
quiet
but
handsome
street
near
Hyde
Park
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
brilliant
light
of
the
lamp
which
burnt
before
its
door
,
guided
her
to
the
spot
,
the
clock
struck
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
loitered
for
a
few
paces
as
though
irresolute
,
and
making
up
her
mind
to
advance
;
but
the
sound
determined
her
,
and
she
stepped
into
the
hall
.
 
<EOS>
The
porter
's
seat
was
vacant
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
round
with
an
air
of
incertitude
,
and
advanced
towards
the
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
young
woman
!
"
said
a
smartly
-
dressed
female
,
looking
out
from
a
door
behind
her
,
"
who
do
you
want
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
lady
who
is
stopping
in
this
house
,
"
answered
the
girl
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
lady
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
reply
,
accompanied
with
a
scornful
look
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
lady
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Maylie
,
"
said
Nancy
.
   
<EOS>
The
young
woman
,
who
had
by
this
time
,
noted
her
appearance
,
replied
only
by
a
look
of
virtuous
disdain
;
and
summoned
a
man
to
answer
her
.
 
<EOS>
To
him
,
Nancy
repeated
her
request
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
name
am
I
to
say
?
"
asked
the
waiter
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
of
no
use
saying
any
,
"
replied
Nancy
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
business
?
"
said
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
nor
that
neither
,
"
rejoined
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
man
,
pushing
her
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
None
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
Take
yourself
off
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
carried
out
if
I
go
!
"
said
the
girl
violently
;
"
and
I
can
make
that
a
job
that
two
of
you
wo
n't
like
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Is
n't
there
anybody
here
,
"
she
said
,
looking
round
,
"
that
will
see
a
simple
message
carried
for
a
poor
wretch
like
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
This
appeal
produced
an
effect
on
a
good
-
tempered
-
faced
man
-
cook
,
who
with
some
of
the
other
servants
was
looking
on
,
and
who
stepped
forward
to
interfere
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
it
up
for
her
,
Joe
;
ca
n't
you
?
"
said
this
person
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
good
?
"
replied
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
suppose
the
young
lady
will
see
such
as
her
;
do
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
This
allusion
to
Nancy
's
doubtful
character
,
raised
a
vast
quantity
of
chaste
wrath
in
the
bosoms
of
four
housemaids
,
who
remarked
,
with
great
fervour
,
that
the
creature
was
a
disgrace
to
her
sex
;
and
strongly
advocated
her
being
thrown
,
ruthlessly
,
into
the
kennel
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
what
you
like
with
me
,
"
said
the
girl
,
turning
to
the
men
again
;
"
but
do
what
I
ask
you
first
,
and
I
ask
you
to
give
this
message
for
God
Almighty
's
sake
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
soft
-
hearted
cook
added
his
intercession
,
and
the
result
was
that
the
man
who
had
first
appeared
undertook
its
delivery
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
it
to
be
?
"
said
the
man
,
with
one
foot
on
the
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
a
young
woman
earnestly
asks
to
speak
to
Miss
Maylie
alone
,
"
said
Nancy
;
"
and
that
if
the
lady
will
only
hear
the
first
word
she
has
to
say
,
she
will
know
whether
to
hear
her
business
,
or
to
have
her
turned
out
of
doors
as
an
impostor
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
said
the
man
,
"
you
're
coming
it
strong
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
give
the
message
,
"
said
the
girl
firmly
;
"
and
let
me
hear
the
answer
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
man
ran
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
Nancy
remained
,
pale
and
almost
breathless
,
listening
with
quivering
lip
to
the
very
audible
expressions
of
scorn
,
of
which
the
chaste
housemaids
were
very
prolific
;
and
of
which
they
became
still
more
so
,
when
the
man
returned
,
and
said
the
young
woman
was
to
walk
upstairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
good
being
proper
in
this
world
,
"
said
the
first
housemaid
.
   
<EOS>
"
Brass
can
do
better
than
the
gold
what
has
stood
the
fire
,
"
said
the
second
.
   
<EOS>
The
third
contented
herself
with
wondering
"
what
ladies
was
made
of
"
;
and
the
fourth
took
the
first
in
a
quartette
of
"
Shameful
!
"
<EOS>
with
which
the
Dianas
concluded
.
   
<EOS>
Regardless
of
all
this
:
for
she
had
weightier
matters
at
heart
:
Nancy
followed
the
man
,
with
trembling
limbs
,
to
a
small
ante
-
chamber
,
lighted
by
a
lamp
from
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
Here
he
left
her
,
and
retired
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
40
.
<EOS>
A
strange
interview
,
which
is
a
sequel
to
the
last
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
The
girl
's
life
had
been
squandered
in
the
streets
,
and
among
the
most
noisome
of
the
stews
and
dens
of
London
,
but
there
was
something
of
the
woman
's
original
nature
left
in
her
still
;
and
when
she
heard
a
light
step
approaching
the
door
opposite
to
that
by
which
she
had
entered
,
and
thought
of
the
wide
contrast
which
the
small
room
would
in
another
moment
contain
,
she
felt
burdened
with
the
sense
of
her
own
deep
shame
,
and
shrunk
as
though
she
could
scarcely
bear
the
presence
of
her
with
whom
she
had
sought
this
interview
.
   
<EOS>
But
struggling
with
these
better
feelings
was
pride
,
---
the
vice
of
the
lowest
and
most
debased
creatures
no
less
than
of
the
high
and
self
-
assured
.
 
<EOS>
The
miserable
companion
of
thieves
and
ruffians
,
the
fallen
outcast
of
low
haunts
,
the
associate
of
the
scourings
of
the
jails
and
hulks
,
living
within
the
shadow
of
the
gallows
itself
,
---
even
this
degraded
being
felt
too
proud
to
betray
a
feeble
gleam
of
the
womanly
feeling
which
she
thought
a
weakness
,
but
which
alone
connected
her
with
that
humanity
,
of
which
her
wasting
life
had
obliterated
so
many
,
many
traces
when
a
very
child
.
   
<EOS>
She
raised
her
eyes
sufficiently
to
observe
that
the
figure
which
presented
itself
was
that
of
a
slight
and
beautiful
girl
;
then
,
bending
them
on
the
ground
,
she
tossed
her
head
with
affected
carelessness
as
she
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
hard
matter
to
get
to
see
you
,
lady
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
taken
offence
,
and
gone
away
,
as
many
would
have
done
,
you
'd
have
been
sorry
for
it
one
day
,
and
not
without
reason
either
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
if
any
one
has
behaved
harshly
to
you
,
"
replied
Rose
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
think
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
why
you
wished
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
person
you
inquired
for
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
kind
tone
of
this
answer
,
the
sweet
voice
,
the
gentle
manner
,
the
absence
of
any
accent
of
haughtiness
or
displeasure
,
took
the
girl
completely
by
surprise
,
and
she
burst
into
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
lady
,
lady
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
clasping
her
hands
passionately
before
her
face
,
"
if
there
was
more
like
you
,
there
would
be
fewer
like
me
,
---
there
would
---
there
would
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
"
said
Rose
,
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
in
poverty
or
affliction
I
shall
be
truly
glad
to
relieve
you
if
I
can
,
---
I
shall
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Sit
down
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
stand
,
lady
,
"
said
the
girl
,
still
weeping
,
"
and
do
not
speak
to
me
so
kindly
till
you
know
me
better
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
growing
late
.
 
<EOS>
Is
---
<EOS>
is
---
that
door
shut
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Rose
,
recoiling
a
few
steps
,
as
if
to
be
nearer
assistance
in
case
she
should
require
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
said
the
girl
,
"
I
am
about
to
put
my
life
and
the
lives
of
others
in
your
hands
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
the
girl
that
dragged
little
Oliver
back
to
old
Fagin
's
on
the
night
<EOS>
he
went
out
from
the
house
in
Pentonville
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
!
"
said
Rose
Maylie
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
,
lady
!
"
replied
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
infamous
creature
you
have
heard
of
,
that
lives
among
the
thieves
,
and
that
never
from
the
first
moment
I
can
recollect
my
eyes
and
senses
opening
on
London
streets
<EOS>
have
known
any
better
life
,
or
kinder
words
than
they
have
given
me
,
so
help
me
God
!
 
<EOS>
Do
not
mind
shrinking
openly
from
me
,
lady
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
younger
than
you
would
think
,
to
look
at
me
,
but
I
am
well
used
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
poorest
women
fall
back
,
as
I
make
my
way
along
the
crowded
pavement
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
dreadful
things
are
these
!
"
<EOS>
said
Rose
,
involuntarily
falling
from
her
strange
companion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
Heaven
upon
your
knees
,
dear
lady
,
"
cried
the
girl
,
"
that
you
had
friends
to
care
for
and
keep
you
in
your
childhood
,
and
that
you
were
never
in
the
midst
of
cold
and
hunger
,
and
riot
and
drunkenness
,
and
---
and
---
something
worse
than
all
---
as
I
have
been
from
my
cradle
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
use
the
word
,
for
the
alley
and
the
gutter
were
mine
,
as
they
will
be
my
deathbed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
pity
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
Rose
,
in
a
broken
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
wrings
my
heart
to
hear
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Heaven
bless
you
for
your
goodness
!
"
rejoined
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
knew
what
I
am
sometimes
,
you
would
pity
me
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
stolen
away
from
those
who
would
surely
murder
me
,
if
they
knew
I
had
been
here
,
to
tell
you
what
I
have
overheard
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
a
man
named
Monks
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Rose
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
knows
you
,
"
replied
the
girl
;
"
and
knew
you
were
here
,
for
it
was
by
hearing
him
tell
the
place
that
I
found
you
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
the
name
,
"
said
Rose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
he
goes
by
some
other
amongst
us
,
"
rejoined
the
girl
,
"
which
I
more
than
thought
before
.
 
<EOS>
Some
time
ago
,
and
soon
after
Oliver
was
put
into
your
house
on
the
night
of
the
robbery
<EOS>
,
I
---
suspecting
this
man
---
listened
to
a
conversation
held
between
him
and
Fagin
in
the
dark
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
out
,
from
what
I
heard
,
that
Monks
---
the
man
I
asked
you
about
,
you
know
---
"
   
"
Yes
,
"
said
Rose
,
"
I
understand
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
---
That
Monks
,
"
pursued
the
girl
,
"
had
seen
him
accidentally
with
two
of
our
boys
on
the
day
we
first
lost
him
,
and
had
known
him
directly
to
be
the
same
child
that
he
was
watching
for
,
though
I
could
n't
make
out
why
.
 
<EOS>
A
bargain
was
struck
with
Fagin
,
that
if
Oliver
was
got
back
he
should
have
a
certain
sum
;
and
he
was
to
have
more
for
making
him
a
thief
,
which
this
Monks
wanted
for
some
purpose
of
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
what
purpose
?
"
asked
Rose
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
caught
sight
of
my
shadow
on
the
wall
as
I
listened
,
in
the
hope
of
finding
out
,
"
said
the
girl
;
"
and
there
are
not
many
people
besides
me
that
could
have
got
out
of
their
way
in
time
to
escape
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
did
;
and
I
saw
him
no
more
till
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
occurred
then
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
,
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Last
night
he
came
again
.
 
<EOS>
Again
they
went
upstairs
,
and
<EOS>
I
,
wrapping
myself
up
so
that
my
shadow
would
not
betray
me
,
again
listened
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
words
I
heard
Monks
say
were
these
:
 
"
<EOS>
So
the
only
proofs
of
the
boy
's
identity
lie
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
,
and
the
old
hag
that
received
them
from
the
mother
is
rotting
in
her
coffin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
laughed
,
and
talked
of
his
success
in
doing
this
;
and
Monks
,
talking
on
about
the
boy
,
and
getting
very
wild
,
said
that
though
he
had
got
the
young
devil
's
money
safely
know
,
he
'd
rather
have
had
it
the
other
way
;
for
,
what
a
game
it
would
have
been
to
have
brought
down
the
boast
of
the
father
's
will
,
by
driving
him
through
every
jail
in
town
,
and
then
hauling
him
up
for
some
capital
felony
which
Fagin
could
easily
manage
,
after
having
made
a
good
profit
of
him
besides
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
all
this
!
"
said
Rose
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
truth
,
lady
,
though
it
comes
from
my
lips
,
"
replied
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
he
said
,
with
oaths
common
enough
in
my
ears
,
but
strange
to
yours
,
that
if
he
could
gratify
his
hatred
by
taking
the
boy
's
life
without
bringing
his
own
neck
in
danger
,
he
would
;
but
,
as
he
could
n't
,
he
'd
be
upon
the
watch
to
meet
him
at
every
turn
in
life
;
and
if
he
took
advantage
of
his
birth
and
history
,
he
might
harm
him
yet
.
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
Fagin
,
"
he
says
,
"
Jew
as
you
are
,
you
never
laid
such
snares
as
I
'll
contrive
for
my
young
brother
,
Oliver
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
His
brother
!
"
exclaimed
Rose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Those
were
his
words
,
"
said
Nancy
,
glancing
uneasily
round
,
as
she
had
scarcely
ceased
to
do
,
since
she
began
to
speak
,
for
a
vision
of
Sikes
haunted
her
perpetually
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
more
.
<EOS>
When
he
spoke
of
you
and
the
other
lady
,
and
said
it
seemed
contrived
by
Heaven
,
or
the
devil
,
against
him
,
that
Oliver
should
come
into
your
hands
,
he
laughed
,
and
said
there
was
some
comfort
in
that
too
,
for
how
many
thousands
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pounds
would
you
not
give
,
if
you
had
them
,
to
know
who
your
two
-
legged
spaniel
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
mean
,
"
said
Rose
,
turning
very
pale
,
"
to
tell
me
that
this
was
said
in
earnest
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
spoke
in
hard
and
angry
earnest
,
<EOS>
if
a
man
ever
did
,
"
replied
the
girl
,
shaking
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
an
earnest
man
when
his
hatred
is
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
many
who
do
worse
things
;
but
I
'd
rather
listen
to
them
all
a
dozen
times
,
than
to
that
Monks
once
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
growing
late
,
and
I
have
to
reach
home
without
suspicion
of
having
been
on
such
an
errand
as
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
get
back
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
what
can
I
do
?
"
said
Rose
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
what
use
can
I
turn
this
communication
without
you
?
 
<EOS>
Back
!
 
<EOS>
Why
do
you
wish
to
return
to
companions
you
paint
in
such
terrible
colors
?
 
<EOS>
If
you
repeat
this
information
to
a
gentleman
whom
I
can
summon
in
an
instant
from
the
next
room
,
you
can
be
consigned
to
some
place
of
safety
without
half
an
hour
's
delay
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
go
back
,
"
said
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
back
,
because
---
how
can
I
tell
such
things
to
an
innocent
lady
like
you
?
---
<EOS>
because
among
the
men
I
have
told
you
of
,
there
is
one
:
the
most
desperate
among
them
all
;
that
I
ca
n't
leave
:
 
<EOS>
no
,
not
even
to
be
saved
from
the
life
I
am
leading
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
having
interfered
in
this
dear
boy
's
behalf
before
,
"
said
Rose
;
"
your
coming
here
,
at
so
great
a
risk
,
to
tell
me
what
you
have
heard
;
your
manner
,
which
convinces
me
of
the
truth
of
what
you
say
;
your
evident
contrition
,
and
sense
of
shame
;
all
lead
me
to
believe
that
you
might
yet
be
reclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
said
the
earnest
girl
,
folding
her
hands
as
the
tears
coursed
down
her
face
,
"
do
not
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
the
entreaties
of
one
of
your
own
sex
;
the
first
---
the
first
,
I
do
believe
,
who
ever
appealed
to
you
in
the
voice
of
pity
and
compassion
.
 
<EOS>
Do
hear
my
words
,
and
let
me
save
you
yet
,
for
better
things
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lady
,
"
cried
the
girl
,
sinking
on
her
knees
,
"
dear
,
sweet
,
angel
lady
<EOS>
,
you
ARE
the
first
that
ever
blessed
me
with
such
words
as
these
,
and
if
I
had
heard
them
years
ago
,
they
might
have
turned
me
from
a
life
of
sin
and
sorrow
;
but
it
is
too
late
,
it
is
too
late
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
never
too
late
,
"
said
Rose
,
"
for
penitence
and
atonement
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
cried
the
girl
,
writhing
in
agony
of
her
mind
;
"
I
can
not
leave
him
now
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
be
his
death
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
be
?
"
asked
Rose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
could
save
him
,
"
cried
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
told
others
what
I
have
told
you
,
and
led
to
their
being
taken
,
he
would
be
sure
to
die
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
the
boldest
,
and
has
been
so
cruel
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
,
"
cried
Rose
,
"
that
for
such
a
man
as
this
,
you
can
resign
every
future
hope
,
and
the
certainty
of
immediate
rescue
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
madness
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
,
"
answered
the
girl
;
<EOS>
"
I
only
know
that
it
is
so
,
and
not
with
me
alone
,
but
with
hundreds
of
others
as
bad
and
wretched
as
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
go
back
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
it
is
God
's
wrath
for
the
wrong
I
have
done
,
I
do
not
know
;
but
I
am
drawn
back
to
him
through
every
suffering
and
ill
usage
;
and
I
should
be
,
I
believe
,
if
I
knew
that
I
was
to
die
by
his
hand
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
do
?
"
said
Rose
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
let
you
depart
from
me
thus
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
should
,
lady
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
,
"
rejoined
the
girl
,
rising
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
stop
my
going
because
I
have
trusted
in
your
goodness
,
and
forced
no
promise
from
you
,
as
I
might
have
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
what
use
,
then
,
is
the
communication
you
have
made
?
"
said
Rose
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
mystery
must
be
investigated
,
or
how
will
its
disclosure
to
me
,
benefit
Oliver
,
whom
you
are
anxious
to
serve
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
some
kind
gentleman
about
you
that
will
hear
it
as
a
secret
,
and
advise
you
what
to
do
,
"
rejoined
the
girl
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
where
can
I
find
you
again
when
it
is
necessary
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Rose
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
seek
to
know
where
these
dreadful
people
live
,
but
where
will
you
be
walking
or
passing
at
any
settled
period
from
this
time
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
promise
me
that
you
will
have
my
secret
strictly
kept
,
and
come
alone
,
or
with
the
only
other
person
that
knows
it
;
and
that
I
shall
not
be
watched
or
followed
?
"
asked
the
girl
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
promise
you
solemnly
,
"
answered
Rose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Every
Sunday
night
,
from
eleven
until
the
clock
strikes
twelve
,
"
said
the
girl
without
hesitation
,
"
I
will
walk
on
London
Bridge
if
I
am
alive
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
another
moment
,
"
interposed
Rose
,
as
the
girl
moved
hurriedly
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Think
once
again
on
your
own
condition
,
and
the
opportunity
you
have
of
escaping
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
a
claim
on
me
:
 
not
only
as
the
voluntary
bearer
of
this
intelligence
,
but
as
a
woman
lost
almost
beyond
redemption
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
return
to
this
gang
of
robbers
,
and
to
this
man
,
when
a
word
can
save
you
?
 
<EOS>
What
fascination
is
it
that
can
take
you
back
,
and
make
you
cling
to
wickedness
and
misery
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
is
there
no
chord
in
your
heart
that
I
can
touch
!
 
<EOS>
Is
there
nothing
left
,
to
which
I
can
appeal
against
this
terrible
infatuation
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
ladies
as
young
,
and
good
,
and
beautiful
as
you
are
,
"
replied
the
girl
steadily
,
"
give
away
your
hearts
,
love
will
carry
you
all
lengths
---
even
such
as
you
,
who
have
home
,
friends
,
other
admirers
,
everything
,
to
fill
them
.
 
<EOS>
When
such
as
I
,
who
have
no
certain
roof
but
the
coffinlid
,
and
no
friend
in
sickness
or
death
but
the
hospital
nurse
,
set
our
rotten
hearts
on
any
man
,
and
let
him
fill
the
place
that
has
been
a
blank
through
all
our
wretched
lives
,
who
can
hope
to
cure
us
?
 
<EOS>
Pity
us
,
lady
---
pity
us
for
having
only
one
feeling
of
the
woman
left
,
and
for
having
that
turned
,
by
a
heavy
judgment
,
from
a
comfort
and
a
pride
,
into
a
new
means
of
violence
and
suffering
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
,
"
said
Rose
,
after
a
pause
,
"
take
some
money
from
me
,
which
may
enable
you
to
live
without
dishonesty
---
at
all
events
until
we
meet
again
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Not
a
penny
,
"
replied
the
girl
,
waving
her
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
not
close
your
heart
against
all
my
efforts
to
help
you
,
"
said
Rose
,
stepping
gently
forward
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
serve
you
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
serve
me
best
,
lady
,
"
replied
the
girl
,
wringing
her
hands
,
"
if
you
could
take
my
life
at
once
;
for
I
have
felt
more
grief
to
think
of
what
I
am
,
to
-
night
,
than
I
ever
did
before
,
and
it
would
be
something
not
to
die
in
the
hell
in
which
I
have
lived
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
sweet
lady
,
and
send
as
much
happiness
on
your
head
as
I
have
brought
shame
on
mine
!
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
speaking
,
and
sobbing
aloud
,
the
unhappy
creature
turned
away
;
while
Rose
Maylie
,
overpowered
by
this
extraordinary
interview
,
which
had
more
the
semblance
of
a
rapid
dream
than
an
actual
occurance
,
sank
into
a
chair
,
and
endeavoured
to
collect
her
wandering
thoughts
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
41
.
<EOS>
Containing
fresh
discoveries
,
and
showing
that
suprises
,
like
misfortunes
,
seldom
come
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Her
situation
was
,
indeed
,
one
of
no
common
trial
and
difficulty
.
   
<EOS>
While
she
felt
the
most
eager
and
burning
desire
to
penetrate
the
mystery
in
which
Oliver
's
history
was
enveloped
,
she
could
not
but
hold
sacred
the
confidence
which
the
miserable
woman
with
whom
she
had
just
conversed
,
had
reposed
in
her
,
as
a
young
and
guileless
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Her
words
and
manner
had
touched
Rose
Maylie
's
heart
;
and
,
mingled
with
her
love
for
her
young
charge
,
and
scarcely
less
intense
in
its
truth
and
fervour
,
was
her
fond
wish
to
win
the
outcast
back
to
repentance
and
hope
.
   
<EOS>
They
purposed
remaining
in
London
only
three
days
,
prior
to
departing
for
some
weeks
to
a
distant
part
of
the
coast
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
now
midnight
of
the
first
day
.
 
<EOS>
What
course
of
action
could
she
determine
upon
,
which
could
be
adopted
in
eight
-
and
-
forty
hours
?
<EOS>
Or
how
could
she
postpone
the
journey
without
exciting
suspicion
?
   
<EOS>
Mr
Losberne
was
with
them
,
and
would
be
for
the
next
two
days
;
but
Rose
was
too
well
acquainted
with
the
excellent
gentleman
's
impetuosity
,
and
foresaw
too
clearly
the
wrath
with
which
,
in
the
first
explosion
of
his
indignation
,
he
would
regard
the
instrument
of
Oliver
's
recapture
,
to
trust
him
with
the
secret
,
when
her
representations
in
the
girl
's
behalf
could
be
seconded
by
no
experienced
person
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
all
reasons
for
the
greatest
caution
and
most
circumspect
behaviour
in
communicating
it
to
Mrs
Maylie
,
whose
first
impulse
would
infallibly
be
to
hold
a
conference
with
the
worthy
doctor
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
resorting
to
any
legal
adviser
,
even
if
she
had
known
how
to
do
so
,
it
was
scarcely
to
be
thought
of
,
for
the
same
reason
.
 
<EOS>
Once
the
thought
occurred
to
her
of
seeking
assistance
from
Harry
;
but
this
awakened
the
recollection
of
their
last
parting
,
and
it
seemed
unworthy
of
her
to
call
him
back
,
when
---
the
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
as
she
pursued
this
train
of
reflection
---
he
might
have
by
this
time
learnt
to
forget
her
,
and
to
be
happier
away
.
   
<EOS>
Disturbed
by
these
different
reflections
;
inclining
now
to
one
course
and
then
to
another
,
and
again
recoiling
from
all
,
as
each
successive
consideration
presented
itself
to
her
mind
;
Rose
passed
a
sleepless
and
anxious
night
.
 
<EOS>
After
more
communing
with
herself
next
day
,
she
arrived
at
the
desperate
conclusion
of
consulting
Harry
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
be
painful
to
him
,
"
she
thought
,
"
to
come
back
here
,
how
painful
it
will
be
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
But
perhaps
he
will
not
come
;
he
may
write
,
or
he
may
come
himself
,
and
studiously
abstain
from
meeting
me
---
he
did
when
he
went
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
thought
he
would
;
but
it
was
better
for
us
both
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
here
Rose
dropped
the
pen
,
and
turned
away
,
as
though
the
very
paper
which
was
to
be
her
messenger
should
not
see
her
weep
.
   
<EOS>
She
had
taken
up
the
same
pen
,
and
laid
it
down
again
fifty
times
,
and
had
considered
and
reconsidered
the
first
line
of
her
letter
without
writing
the
first
word
,
when
Oliver
,
who
had
been
walking
in
the
streets
,
with
Mr
Giles
for
a
body
-
guard
,
entered
the
room
in
such
breathless
haste
and
violent
agitation
,
as
seemed
to
betoken
some
new
cause
of
alarm
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
makes
you
look
so
flurried
?
"
asked
Rose
,
advancing
to
meet
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
how
;
I
feel
as
if
I
should
be
choked
,
"
replied
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
!
 
<EOS>
To
think
that
I
should
see
him
at
last
,
and
you
should
be
able
to
know
that
I
have
told
you
the
truth
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
thought
you
had
told
us
anything
but
the
truth
,
"
said
Rose
,
soothing
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
what
is
this
?
<EOS>
---
of
whom
do
you
speak
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
the
gentleman
,
"
replied
Oliver
,
scarcely
able
to
articulate
,
"
the
gentleman
who
was
so
good
to
me
---
<EOS>
Mr
Brownlow
,
that
we
have
so
often
talked
about
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
asked
Rose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Getting
out
of
a
coach
,
"
replied
Oliver
,
shedding
tears
of
delight
,
"
and
going
into
a
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
speak
to
him
<EOS>
---
I
could
n't
speak
to
him
,
for
he
did
n't
see
me
,
and
I
trembled
so
,
that
I
was
not
able
to
go
up
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
Giles
asked
,
for
me
,
whether
he
lived
there
,
and
they
said
he
did
.
 
<EOS>
Look
here
,
"
said
Oliver
,
opening
a
scrap
of
paper
,
"
<EOS>
here
it
is
;
here
's
where
he
lives
---
I
'm
going
there
directly
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
dear
me
,
dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
What
shall
I
do
when
I
come
to
see
him
and
hear
him
speak
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
her
attention
not
a
little
distracted
by
these
and
a
great
many
other
incoherent
exclamations
of
joy
,
Rose
read
the
address
,
which
was
Craven
Street
,
in
the
Strand
.
 
<EOS>
She
very
soon
determined
upon
turning
the
discovery
to
account
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quick
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
them
to
fetch
a
hackney
-
coach
,
and
be
ready
to
go
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
take
you
there
directly
,
without
a
minute
's
loss
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
only
tell
my
aunt
that
we
are
going
out
for
an
hour
,
and
be
ready
as
soon
as
you
are
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
needed
no
prompting
to
despatch
,
and
in
little
more
than
five
minutes
they
were
on
their
way
to
Craven
Street
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
arrived
there
,
Rose
left
Oliver
in
the
coach
,
under
pretence
of
preparing
the
old
gentleman
to
receive
him
;
and
sending
up
her
card
by
the
servant
,
requested
to
see
Mr
Brownlow
on
very
pressing
business
.
 
<EOS>
The
servant
soon
returned
,
to
beg
that
she
would
walk
upstairs
;
and
following
him
into
an
upper
room
,
Miss
Maylie
was
presented
to
an
elderly
gentleman
of
benevolent
appearance
,
in
a
bottle
-
green
coat
.
 
<EOS>
At
no
great
distance
from
whom
,
was
seated
another
old
gentleman
,
in
nankeen
breeches
and
gaiters
;
who
did
not
look
particularly
benevolent
,
and
who
was
sitting
with
his
hands
clasped
on
the
top
of
a
thick
stick
,
and
his
chin
propped
thereupon
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
in
the
bottle
-
green
coat
,
hastily
rising
with
great
politeness
,
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
young
lady
---
<EOS>
I
imagined
it
was
some
importunate
person
who
<EOS>
---
I
beg
you
will
excuse
me
.
 
<EOS>
Be
seated
,
pray
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Brownlow
,
I
believe
,
sir
?
"
said
Rose
,
glancing
from
the
other
gentleman
to
the
one
who
had
spoken
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
my
name
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
my
friend
,
Mr
Grimwig
.
 
<EOS>
Grimwig
,
will
you
leave
us
for
a
few
minutes
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
"
interposed
Miss
Maylie
,
"
that
at
this
period
of
our
interview
,
I
need
not
give
that
gentleman
the
trouble
of
going
away
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
am
correctly
informed
,
he
is
cognizant
of
the
business
on
which
I
wish
to
speak
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Brownlow
inclined
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Grimwig
,
who
had
made
one
very
stiff
bow
,
and
risen
from
his
chair
,
made
another
very
stiff
bow
,
and
dropped
into
it
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
surprise
you
very
much
,
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
,
"
said
Rose
,
naturally
embarrassed
;
"
<EOS>
but
you
once
showed
great
benevolence
and
goodness
to
a
very
dear
young
friend
of
mine
,
and
I
am
sure
you
will
take
an
interest
in
hearing
of
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oliver
Twist
you
knew
him
as
,
"
replied
Rose
.
   
<EOS>
The
words
no
sooner
escaped
her
lips
,
than
Mr
Grimwig
,
who
had
been
affecting
to
dip
into
a
large
book
that
lay
on
the
table
,
upset
it
with
a
great
crash
,
and
falling
back
in
his
chair
,
discharged
from
his
features
every
expression
but
one
of
unmitigated
wonder
,
and
indulged
in
a
prolonged
and
vacant
stare
;
then
,
as
if
ashamed
of
having
betrayed
so
much
emotion
,
he
jerked
himself
,
as
it
were
,
by
a
convulsion
into
his
former
attitude
,
and
looking
out
straight
before
him
emitted
a
long
deep
whistle
,
which
seemed
,
at
last
,
not
to
be
discharged
on
empty
air
,
but
to
die
away
in
the
innermost
recesses
of
his
stomach
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Browlow
was
no
less
surprised
,
although
his
astonishment
was
not
expressed
in
the
same
eccentric
manner
.
 
<EOS>
He
drew
his
chair
nearer
to
Miss
Maylie
's
,
and
said
,
   
"
<EOS>
Do
me
the
favour
,
my
dear
young
lady
,
to
leave
entirely
out
of
the
question
that
goodness
and
benevolence
of
which
you
speak
,
and
of
which
nobody
else
knows
anything
;
and
if
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
produce
any
evidence
which
will
alter
the
unfavourable
opinion
I
was
once
induced
to
entertain
of
that
poor
child
,
in
Heaven
's
name
put
me
in
possession
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
bad
one
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
eat
my
head
if
he
is
not
a
bad
one
,
"
growled
Mr
Grimwig
,
speaking
by
some
ventriloquial
power
,
without
moving
a
muscle
of
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
child
of
a
noble
nature
and
a
warm
heart
,
"
said
Rose
,
colouring
;
"
and
that
Power
which
has
thought
fit
to
try
him
beyond
his
years
,
has
planted
in
his
breast
affections
and
feelings
which
would
do
honour
to
many
who
have
numbered
his
days
six
times
over
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
only
sixty
-
one
,
"
said
Mr
Grimwig
,
with
the
same
rigid
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
,
as
the
devil
's
in
it
if
this
Oliver
is
not
twelve
years
old
at
least
,
I
do
n't
see
the
application
of
that
remark
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
not
heed
my
friend
,
Miss
Maylie
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
;
"
he
does
not
mean
what
he
says
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
does
,
"
growled
Mr
Grimwig
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
he
does
not
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
obviously
rising
in
wrath
as
he
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
'll
eat
his
head
,
if
he
does
n't
,
"
growled
Mr
Grimwig
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
would
deserve
to
have
it
knocked
off
,
if
he
does
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
he
'd
uncommonly
like
to
see
any
man
offer
to
do
it
,
"
responded
Mr
Grimwig
,
knocking
his
stick
upon
the
floor
.
   
<EOS>
Having
gone
thus
far
,
the
two
old
gentlemen
severally
took
snuff
,
and
afterwards
shook
hands
,
according
to
their
invariable
custom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Miss
Maylie
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
"
to
return
to
the
subject
in
which
your
humanity
is
so
much
interested
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
let
me
know
what
intelligence
you
have
of
this
poor
child
:
 
allowing
me
to
promise
that
I
exhausted
every
means
in
my
power
of
discovering
him
,
and
that
since
I
have
been
absent
from
this
country
,
my
first
impression
that
he
had
imposed
upon
me
,
and
had
been
persuaded
by
his
former
associates
to
rob
me
,
has
been
considerably
shaken
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rose
,
who
had
had
time
to
collect
her
thoughts
,
at
once
related
,
in
a
few
natural
words
,
all
that
had
befallen
Oliver
since
he
left
Mr
Brownlow
's
house
;
reserving
Nancy
's
information
for
that
gentleman
's
private
ear
,
and
concluding
with
the
assurance
that
his
only
sorrow
,
for
some
months
past
,
had
been
not
being
able
to
meet
with
his
former
benefactor
and
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
God
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
great
happiness
to
me
,
great
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
have
not
told
me
where
he
is
now
,
Miss
Maylie
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
pardon
my
finding
fault
with
you
,
---
<EOS>
but
why
not
have
brought
him
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
waiting
in
a
coach
at
the
door
,
"
replied
Rose
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
this
door
!
"
cried
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
With
which
he
hurried
out
of
the
room
,
down
the
stairs
,
up
the
coachsteps
,
and
into
the
coach
,
without
another
word
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
room
-
door
closed
behind
him
,
Mr
Grimwig
lifted
up
his
head
,
and
converting
one
of
the
hind
legs
of
his
chair
into
a
pivot
,
described
three
distinct
circles
with
the
assistance
of
his
stick
and
the
table
;
stitting
in
it
all
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
After
performing
this
evolution
,
he
rose
and
limped
as
fast
as
he
could
up
and
down
the
room
at
least
a
dozen
times
,
and
then
stopping
suddenly
before
Rose
,
kissed
her
without
the
slightest
preface
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
as
the
young
lady
rose
in
some
alarm
at
this
unusual
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
afraid
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
old
enough
to
be
your
grandfather
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
sweet
girl
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
you
.
 
<EOS>
Here
they
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
fact
,
as
he
threw
himself
at
one
dexterous
dive
into
his
former
seat
,
Mr
Brownlow
returned
,
accompanied
by
Oliver
,
whom
Mr
Grimwig
received
very
graciously
;
and
if
the
gratification
of
that
moment
had
been
the
only
reward
for
all
her
anxiety
and
care
in
Oliver
's
behalf
,
Rose
Maylie
would
have
been
well
repaid
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
somebody
else
who
should
not
be
forgotten
,
by
the
bye
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
ringing
the
bell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Send
Mrs
Bedwin
here
,
if
you
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
housekeeper
answered
the
summons
with
all
dispatch
;
and
dropping
a
curtsey
at
the
door
,
waited
for
orders
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
get
blinder
every
day
,
Bedwin
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
rather
testily
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
that
I
do
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
old
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
People
's
eyes
,
at
my
time
of
life
,
do
n't
improve
with
age
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
have
told
you
that
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Brownlow
;
"
but
put
on
your
glasses
,
and
see
if
you
ca
n't
find
out
what
you
were
wanted
for
,
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
lady
began
to
rummage
in
her
pocket
for
her
spectacles
.
<EOS>
But
Oliver
's
patience
was
not
proof
against
this
new
trial
;
and
yielding
to
his
first
impulse
,
he
sprang
into
her
arms
.
   
<EOS>
"
God
be
good
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
old
lady
,
embracing
him
;
"
it
is
my
innocent
boy
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
old
nurse
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
would
come
back
---
I
knew
he
would
,
"
said
the
old
lady
,
holding
him
in
her
arms
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
well
he
looks
,
and
how
like
a
gentleman
's
son
he
is
dressed
again
!
 
<EOS>
Where
have
you
been
,
this
long
,
long
while
?
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
the
same
sweet
face
,
but
not
so
pale
;
the
same
soft
eye
,
but
not
so
sad
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
forgotten
them
or
his
quiet
smile
,
but
have
seen
them
every
day
,
side
by
side
with
those
of
my
own
dear
children
,
dead
and
gone
since
I
was
a
lightsome
young
creature
.
"
 
<EOS>
Running
on
thus
,
and
now
holding
Oliver
from
her
to
mark
how
he
had
grown
,
now
clasping
him
to
her
and
passing
her
fingers
fondly
through
his
hair
,
the
good
soul
laughed
and
wept
upon
his
neck
by
turns
.
   
<EOS>
Leaving
her
and
Oliver
to
compare
notes
at
leisure
,
Mr
Brownlow
led
the
way
into
another
room
;
and
there
,
heard
from
Rose
a
full
narration
of
her
interview
with
Nancy
,
which
occasioned
him
no
little
surprise
and
perplexity
.
 
<EOS>
Rose
also
explained
her
reasons
for
not
confiding
in
her
friend
Mr
Losberne
in
the
first
instance
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
considered
that
she
had
acted
prudently
,
and
readily
undertook
to
hold
solemn
conference
with
the
worthy
doctor
himself
.
 
<EOS>
To
afford
him
an
early
opportunity
for
the
execution
of
this
design
,
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
call
at
the
hotel
at
eight
o'clock
that
evening
,
and
that
in
the
meantime
Mrs
Maylie
should
be
cautiously
informed
of
all
that
had
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
These
preliminaries
adjusted
,
Rose
and
Oliver
returned
home
.
   
<EOS>
Rose
had
by
no
means
overrated
the
measure
of
the
good
doctor
's
wrath
.
 
<EOS>
Nancy
's
history
was
no
sooner
unfolded
to
him
,
than
he
poured
forth
a
shower
of
mingled
threats
and
execrations
;
threatened
to
make
her
the
first
victim
of
the
combined
ingenuity
of
Messrs.
Blathers
and
Duff
;
and
actually
put
on
his
hat
preparatory
to
sallying
forth
to
obtain
the
assistance
of
those
worthies
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
doubtless
,
he
would
,
in
this
first
outbreak
,
have
carried
the
intention
into
effect
without
a
moment
's
consideration
of
the
consequences
,
if
he
had
not
been
restrained
,
in
part
,
by
corresponding
violence
on
the
side
of
Mr
Brownlow
,
who
was
himself
of
an
irascible
temperament
,
and
party
by
such
arguments
and
representations
as
seemed
best
calculated
to
dissuade
him
from
his
hotbrained
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
what
the
devil
is
to
be
done
?
"
said
the
impetuous
doctor
,
when
they
had
rejoined
the
two
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
we
to
pass
a
vote
of
thanks
to
all
these
vagabonds
,
male
and
female
,
and
beg
them
to
accept
a
hundred
pounds
,
or
so
,
apiece
,
as
a
trifling
mark
of
our
esteem
,
and
some
slight
acknowledgment
of
their
kindness
to
Oliver
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
exactly
that
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Brownlow
,
laughing
;
"
but
we
must
proceed
gently
and
with
great
care
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Gentleness
and
care
,
"
exclaimed
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
send
them
one
and
all
to
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
where
,
"
interposed
Mr
Brownlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
reflect
whether
sending
them
anywhere
is
likely
to
attain
the
object
we
have
in
view
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
object
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Simply
,
the
discovery
of
Oliver
's
parentage
,
and
regaining
for
him
the
inheritance
of
which
,
if
this
story
be
true
,
he
has
been
fraudulently
deprived
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr
Losberne
,
cooling
himself
with
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
;
"
I
almost
forgot
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
pursued
Mr
Brownlow
;
"
placing
this
poor
girl
entirely
out
of
the
question
,
and
supposing
it
were
possible
to
bring
these
scoundrels
to
justice
without
compromising
her
safety
,
what
good
should
we
bring
about
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hanging
a
few
of
them
at
least
,
in
all
probability
,
"
suggested
the
doctor
,
"
and
transporting
the
rest
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
replied
Mr
Brownlow
,
smiling
;
"
but
no
doubt
they
will
bring
that
about
for
themselves
in
the
fulness
of
time
,
and
if
we
step
in
to
forestall
them
,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
shall
be
performing
a
very
Quixotic
act
,
in
direct
opposition
to
our
own
interest
---
or
at
least
to
Oliver
's
,
which
is
the
same
thing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
inquired
the
doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thus
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
quite
clear
that
we
shall
have
extreme
difficulty
in
getting
to
the
bottom
of
this
mystery
,
unless
we
can
bring
this
man
,
Monks
,
upon
his
knees
.
 
<EOS>
That
can
only
be
done
by
stratagem
,
and
by
catching
him
when
he
is
not
surrounded
by
these
people
.
 
<EOS>
For
<EOS>
,
suppose
he
were
apprehended
,
we
have
no
proof
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
even
(
so
far
as
we
know
,
or
as
the
facts
appear
to
us
)
concerned
with
the
gang
in
any
of
their
robberies
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
not
discharged
,
it
is
very
unlikely
that
he
could
receive
any
further
punishment
than
being
committed
to
prison
as
a
rogue
and
vagabond
;
and
of
course
ever
afterwards
his
mouth
would
be
so
obstinately
closed
that
he
might
as
well
,
for
our
purposes
,
be
deaf
,
dumb
,
blind
,
and
an
idiot
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
the
doctor
impetuously
,
"
I
put
it
to
you
again
,
whether
you
think
it
reasonable
that
this
promise
to
the
girl
should
be
considered
binding
;
a
promise
made
with
the
best
and
kindest
intentions
,
but
really
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
Do
not
discuss
the
point
,
my
dear
young
lady
,
pray
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
interrupting
Rose
as
she
was
about
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
The
promise
shall
be
kept
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
it
will
,
in
the
slightest
degree
,
interfere
with
our
proceedings
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
before
we
can
resolve
upon
any
precise
course
of
action
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
see
the
girl
;
to
ascertain
from
her
whether
she
will
point
out
this
Monks
,
on
the
understanding
that
he
is
to
be
dealt
with
by
us
,
and
not
by
the
law
;
or
,
if
she
will
not
,
or
can
not
do
that
,
to
procure
from
her
such
an
account
of
his
haunts
and
description
of
his
person
,
as
will
enable
us
to
identify
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
can
not
be
seen
until
next
Sunday
night
;
this
is
Tuesday
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
suggest
that
in
the
meantime
,
we
remain
perfectly
quiet
,
and
keep
these
matters
secret
even
from
Oliver
himself
.
"
   
<EOS>
Although
Mr
Loseberne
received
with
many
wry
faces
a
proposal
involving
a
delay
of
five
whole
days
,
he
was
fain
to
admit
that
no
better
course
occurred
to
him
just
then
;
and
as
both
Rose
and
Mrs
Maylie
sided
very
strongly
with
Mr
Brownlow
,
that
gentleman
's
proposition
was
carried
unanimously
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
,
"
he
said
,
"
to
call
in
the
aid
of
my
friend
Grimwig
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
strange
creature
,
but
a
shrewd
one
,
and
might
prove
of
material
assistance
to
us
;
I
should
say
that
he
was
bred
a
lawyer
,
and
quitted
the
Bar
in
disgust
because
he
had
only
one
brief
and
a
motion
of
course
,
in
twenty
years
,
though
whether
that
is
recommendation
or
not
,
you
must
determine
for
yourselves
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
objection
to
your
calling
in
your
friend
if
I
may
call
in
mine
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
must
put
it
to
the
vote
,
"
replied
Mr
Brownlow
,
"
who
may
he
be
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
lady
's
son
,
and
this
young
lady
's
---
very
old
friend
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
motioning
towards
Mrs
Maylie
,
and
concluding
with
an
expressive
glance
at
her
niece
.
   
<EOS>
Rose
blushed
deeply
,
but
she
did
not
make
any
audible
objection
to
this
motion
(
possibly
she
felt
in
a
hopeless
minority
)
;
and
Harry
Maylie
and
Mr
Grimwig
were
accordingly
added
to
the
committee
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
stay
in
town
,
of
course
,
"
said
Mrs
Maylie
,
"
while
there
remains
the
slightest
prospect
of
prosecuting
this
inquiry
with
a
chance
of
success
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
spare
neither
trouble
nor
expense
in
behalf
of
the
object
in
which
we
are
all
so
deeply
interested
,
and
I
am
content
to
remain
here
,
if
it
be
for
twelve
months
,
so
long
as
you
assure
me
that
any
hope
remains
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
rejoined
Mr
Brownlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
as
I
see
on
the
faces
about
me
,
a
disposition
to
inquire
how
it
happened
that
I
was
not
in
the
way
to
corroborate
Oliver
's
tale
,
and
had
so
suddenly
left
the
kingdom
,
let
me
stipulate
that
I
shall
be
asked
no
questions
until
such
time
as
I
may
deem
it
expedient
to
forestall
them
by
telling
my
own
story
.
 
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
I
make
this
request
with
good
reason
,
for
I
might
otherwise
excite
hopes
destined
never
to
be
realised
,
and
only
increase
difficulties
and
disappointments
already
quite
numerous
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Supper
has
been
announced
,
and
young
Oliver
,
who
is
all
alone
in
the
next
room
,
will
have
begun
to
think
,
by
this
time
,
that
we
have
wearied
of
his
company
,
and
entered
into
some
dark
conspiracy
to
thrust
him
forth
upon
the
world
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
the
old
gentleman
gave
his
hand
to
Mrs
Maylie
,
and
escorted
her
into
the
supper
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Losberne
followed
,
leading
Rose
;
and
the
council
was
,
for
the
present
,
effectually
broken
up
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
42
.
<EOS>
An
old
acquaintance
of
Oliver
's
,
exhibiting
decided
marks
of
genius
,
becomes
a
public
character
in
the
metropolis
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
the
night
when
Nancy
,
having
lulled
Mr
Sikes
to
sleep
,
hurried
on
her
self
-
imposed
mission
to
Rose
Maylie
,
there
advanced
towards
London
,
by
the
Great
North
Road
,
two
persons
,
upon
whom
it
is
expedient
that
this
history
should
bestow
some
attention
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
a
man
and
woman
;
or
perhaps
they
would
be
better
described
as
a
male
and
female
:
 
for
the
former
<EOS>
was
one
of
those
long
-
limbed
,
knock
-
kneed
,
shambling
,
bony
people
,
to
whom
it
is
difficult
to
assign
any
precise
age
,
---
looking
as
they
do
,
when
they
are
yet
boys
,
like
undergrown
men
,
and
when
they
are
almost
men
,
like
overgrown
boys
.
 
<EOS>
The
woman
was
young
,
but
of
a
robust
and
hardy
make
,
as
she
need
have
been
to
bear
the
weight
of
the
heavy
bundle
which
was
strapped
to
her
back
.
 
<EOS>
Her
companion
was
not
encumbered
with
much
luggage
,
as
there
merely
dangled
from
a
stick
which
he
carried
over
his
shoulder
,
a
small
parcel
wrapped
in
a
common
handkerchief
,
and
apparently
light
enough
.
 
<EOS>
This
circumstance
,
added
to
the
length
of
his
legs
,
which
were
of
unusual
extent
,
enabled
him
with
much
ease
to
keep
some
half
-
dozen
paces
in
advance
of
his
companion
,
to
whom
he
occasionally
turned
with
an
impatient
jerk
of
the
head
:
 
as
if
reproaching
her
tardiness
,
and
urging
her
to
greater
exertion
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
,
they
had
toiled
along
the
dusty
road
,
taking
little
heed
of
any
object
within
sight
,
save
when
they
stepped
aside
to
allow
a
wider
passage
for
the
mail
-
coaches
which
were
whirling
out
of
town
,
until
they
passed
through
Highgate
archway
;
when
the
foremost
traveller
stopped
and
called
impatiently
to
his
companion
,
   
"
Come
on
,
ca
n't
yer
?
 
<EOS>
What
a
lazybones
yer
are
,
Charlotte
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
heavy
load
,
I
can
tell
you
,
"
said
the
female
,
coming
up
,
almost
breathless
with
fatigue
.
   
<EOS>
"
Heavy
!
 
<EOS>
What
are
yer
talking
about
?
 
<EOS>
What
are
yer
made
for
?
<EOS>
"
rejoined
the
male
traveller
,
changing
his
own
little
bundle
as
he
spoke
,
to
the
other
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
there
yer
are
,
resting
again
!
   
<EOS>
Well
,
if
yer
ai
n't
enough
to
tire
anybody
's
patience
out
,
I
do
n't
know
what
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
much
farther
?
"
asked
the
woman
,
resting
herself
against
a
bank
,
and
looking
up
with
the
perspiration
streaming
from
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Much
farther
!
 
<EOS>
Yer
<EOS>
as
good
as
there
,
"
said
the
long
-
legged
tramper
,
pointing
out
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
there
!
 
<EOS>
Those
are
the
lights
of
London
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
're
a
good
two
mile
off
,
at
least
,
"
said
the
woman
despondingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
whether
they
're
two
mile
off
,
or
twenty
,
"
said
Noah
Claypole
;
for
he
it
was
;
"
but
get
up
and
come
on
,
or
I
'll
kick
yer
,
<EOS>
and
so
I
give
yer
notice
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
Noah
's
red
nose
grew
redder
with
anger
,
and
as
he
crossed
the
road
while
speaking
,
as
if
fully
prepared
to
put
his
threat
into
execution
,
the
woman
rose
without
any
further
remark
,
and
trudged
onward
by
his
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
do
you
mean
to
stop
for
the
night
,
Noah
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
after
they
had
walked
a
few
hundred
yards
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
should
I
know
?
"
replied
Noah
,
whose
temper
had
been
considerably
impaired
by
walking
.
   
<EOS>
"
Near
,
I
hope
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
near
,
"
replied
Mr
Claypole
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
!
 
<EOS>
Not
near
;
so
do
n't
think
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
tell
yer
that
I
do
n't
mean
to
do
a
thing
,
that
's
enough
,
without
any
why
or
because
either
,
"
replied
Mr
Claypole
with
dignity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
need
n't
be
so
cross
,
"
said
his
companion
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
pretty
thing
it
would
be
,
would
n't
it
to
go
and
stop
at
the
very
first
public
-
house
outside
the
town
,
so
that
Sowerberry
,
if
he
come
up
after
us
,
might
poke
in
his
old
nose
,
and
have
us
taken
back
in
a
cart
with
handcuffs
on
,
"
said
Mr
Claypole
in
a
jeering
tone
.
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
shall
go
and
lose
myself
among
the
narrowest
streets
I
can
find
,
and
not
stop
till
we
come
to
the
very
out
-
of
-
the
-
wayest
house
I
can
set
eyes
on
.
 
<EOS>
'
Cod
,
yer
may
thanks
yer
stars
I
've
got
a
head
;
for
if
we
had
n't
gone
,
at
first
,
the
wrong
road
a
purpose
,
and
come
back
across
country
,
yer'd
have
been
locked
up
hard
and
fast
a
week
ago
,
my
lady
.
 
<EOS>
And
serve
yer
right
for
being
a
fool
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
ai
n't
as
cunning
as
you
are
,
"
replied
Charlotte
;
"
but
do
n't
put
all
the
blame
on
me
,
and
say
I
should
have
been
locked
up
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
have
been
if
I
had
been
,
any
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yer
took
the
money
from
the
till
,
yer
know
yer
did
,
"
said
Mr
Claypole
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
took
it
for
you
,
Noah
,
dear
,
"
rejoined
Charlotte
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
I
keep
it
?
"
asked
Mr
Claypole
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
;
you
trusted
in
me
,
and
let
me
carry
it
like
a
dear
,
and
so
you
are
,
"
said
the
lady
,
chucking
him
under
the
chin
,
and
drawing
her
arm
through
his
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
indeed
the
case
;
but
as
it
was
not
Mr
Claypole
's
habit
to
repose
a
blind
and
foolish
confidence
in
anybody
,
it
should
be
observed
,
in
justice
to
that
gentleman
,
that
he
had
trusted
Charlotte
to
this
extent
,
in
order
that
,
if
they
were
pursued
,
the
money
might
be
found
on
her
:
 
which
would
leave
him
an
opportunity
of
asserting
his
innocence
of
any
theft
,
and
would
greatly
facilitate
his
chances
of
escape
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
,
he
entered
at
this
juncture
,
into
no
explanation
of
his
motives
,
and
they
walked
on
very
lovingly
together
.
   
<EOS>
In
pursuance
of
this
cautious
plan
,
Mr
Claypole
went
on
,
without
halting
,
until
he
arrived
at
the
Angel
at
Islington
,
where
he
wisely
judged
,
from
the
crowd
of
passengers
and
numbers
of
vehicles
,
that
London
began
in
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
Just
pausing
to
observe
which
appeared
the
most
crowded
streets
,
and
consequently
the
most
to
be
avoided
,
he
crossed
into
Saint
John
's
Road
,
and
was
soon
deep
in
the
obscurity
of
the
intricate
and
dirty
ways
,
which
,
lying
between
Gray
's
Inn
Lane
and
Smithfield
,
render
that
part
of
the
town
one
of
the
lowest
and
worst
that
improvement
has
left
in
the
midst
of
London
.
   
<EOS>
Through
these
streets
,
Noah
Claypole
walked
,
dragging
Charlotte
after
him
;
now
stepping
into
the
kennel
to
embrace
at
a
glance
the
whole
external
character
of
some
small
public
-
house
;
now
jogging
on
again
,
as
some
fancied
appearance
induced
him
to
believe
it
too
public
for
his
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
he
stopped
in
front
of
one
,
more
humble
in
appearance
and
more
dirty
than
any
he
had
yet
seen
;
and
,
having
crossed
over
and
surveyed
it
from
the
opposite
pavement
,
graciously
announced
his
intention
of
putting
up
there
,
for
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
give
us
the
bundle
,
"
said
Noah
,
unstrapping
it
from
the
woman
's
shoulders
,
and
slinging
it
over
his
own
;
"
and
do
n't
yer
speak
,
except
when
yer
spoke
to
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
name
of
the
house
---
t
-
h
-
r
---
<EOS>
three
<EOS>
what
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cripples
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
   
<EOS>
"
Three
Cripples
,
"
repeated
Noah
,
"
and
a
very
good
sign
too
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
then
!
 
<EOS>
Keep
close
at
my
heels
,
and
come
along
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
these
injunctions
,
he
pushed
the
rattling
door
with
his
shoulder
,
and
entered
the
house
,
followed
by
his
companion
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
nobody
in
the
bar
but
a
young
Jew
,
who
,
with
his
two
elbows
on
the
counter
,
was
reading
a
dirty
newspaper
.
<EOS>
He
stared
very
hard
at
Noah
,
and
Noah
stared
very
hard
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
If
Noah
had
been
attired
in
his
charity
-
boy
's
dress
,
there
might
have
been
some
reason
for
the
Jew
opening
his
eyes
so
wide
;
but
as
he
had
discarded
the
coat
and
badge
,
and
wore
a
short
smock
-
frock
over
his
leathers
,
there
seemed
no
particular
reason
for
his
appearance
exciting
so
much
attention
in
a
public
-
house
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
this
the
Three
Cripples
?
"
asked
Noah
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
dabe
of
this
'
ouse
,
"
replied
the
Jew
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
gentleman
we
met
on
the
road
,
coming
up
from
the
country
,
recommended
us
here
,
"
said
Noah
,
nudging
Charlotte
,
perhaps
to
call
her
attention
to
this
most
ingenious
device
for
attracting
respect
,
and
perhaps
to
warn
her
to
betray
no
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
want
to
sleep
here
to
-
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I'b
dot
certaid
<EOS>
you
cad
,
"
said
Barney
,
who
was
the
attendant
sprite
;
"
but
I
'll
idquire
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Show
us
the
tap
,
and
give
us
a
bit
of
cold
meat
and
a
drop
of
beer
while
yer
inquiring
,
will
yer
?
"
said
Noah
.
   
<EOS>
Barney
complied
by
ushering
them
into
a
small
back
-
room
,
and
setting
the
required
viands
before
them
;
having
done
which
,
he
informed
the
travellers
that
they
could
be
lodged
that
night
,
and
left
the
amiable
couple
to
their
refreshment
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
this
back
-
room
was
immediately
behind
the
bar
,
and
some
steps
lower
,
so
that
any
person
connected
with
the
house
,
undrawing
a
small
curtain
which
concealed
a
single
pane
of
glass
fixed
in
the
wall
of
the
last
-
named
apartment
,
about
five
feet
from
its
flooring
,
could
not
only
look
down
upon
any
guests
in
the
back
-
room
without
any
great
hazard
of
being
observed
(
the
glass
being
in
a
dark
angle
of
the
wall
,
between
which
and
a
large
upright
beam
the
observer
had
to
thrust
himself
)
,
but
could
,
by
applying
his
ear
to
the
partition
,
ascertain
with
tolerable
distinctness
,
their
subject
of
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
The
landlord
of
the
house
had
not
withdrawn
his
eye
from
this
place
of
espial
for
five
minutes
,
and
Barney
had
only
just
returned
from
making
the
communication
above
related
,
when
Fagin
,
in
the
course
of
his
evening
's
business
,
came
into
the
bar
to
inquire
after
some
of
his
young
pupils
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
said
Barney
:
 
<EOS>
"
stradegers
i
<EOS>
d
the
next
roob
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Strangers
!
"
repeated
the
old
man
in
a
whisper
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Ad
rub
uds
too
,
"
added
Barney
.
 
<EOS>
"
Frob
the
cuttry
,
but
subthig
in
your
way
,
or
I'b
bistaked
.
"
   
<EOS>
Fagin
appeared
to
receive
this
communication
with
great
interest
.
   
<EOS>
Mounting
a
stool
,
he
cautiously
applied
his
eye
to
the
pane
of
glass
,
from
which
secret
post
he
could
see
Mr
Claypole
taking
cold
beef
from
the
dish
,
and
porter
from
the
pot
,
and
administering
homoepathic
doses
of
both
to
Charlotte
,
who
sat
patiently
by
,
eating
and
drinking
at
his
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
<EOS>
he
whispered
,
looking
round
to
Barney
,
"
I
like
that
fellow
's
looks
.
 
<EOS>
He
'd
be
of
use
to
us
;
he
knows
how
to
train
the
girl
already
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
make
as
much
noise
as
a
mouse
,
my
dear
,
and
let
me
hear
'em
talk
---
let
me
hear
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
again
applied
his
eye
to
the
glass
,
and
turning
his
ear
to
the
partition
,
listened
attentively
:
 
with
a
subtle
and
eager
look
upon
his
face
,
that
might
have
appertained
to
some
old
goblin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
mean
to
be
a
gentleman
,
"
said
Mr
Claypole
,
kicking
out
his
legs
,
and
continuing
a
conversation
,
the
commencement
of
which
Fagin
had
arrived
too
late
to
hear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
more
jolly
old
coffins
,
Charlotte
,
but
a
gentleman
's
life
for
me
:
 
and
,
if
yer
like
,
yer
shall
be
a
lady
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
that
well
enough
,
dear
,
"
replied
Charlotte
;
"
but
tills
ai
n't
to
be
emptied
every
day
,
and
people
to
get
clear
off
after
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tills
be
blowed
!
"
said
Mr
Claypole
;
"
there
's
more
things
besides
tills
to
be
emptied
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
asked
his
companion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pockets
,
women
's
ridicules
,
houses
,
mail
-
coaches
,
banks
!
"
said
Mr
Claypole
,
rising
with
the
porter
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
ca
n't
do
all
that
,
dear
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
look
out
to
get
into
company
with
them
as
can
,
"
replied
Noah
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
'll
be
able
to
make
us
useful
some
way
or
another
.
<EOS>
Why
,
you
yourself
are
worth
fifty
women
;
I
never
see
such
a
precious
sly
and
deceitful
creetur
as
yer
can
be
when
I
let
yer
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
,
how
nice
it
is
to
hear
yer
say
so
!
"
exclaimed
Charlotte
,
imprinting
a
kiss
upon
his
ugly
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
that
'll
do
:
 
<EOS>
do
n't
yer
be
too
affectionate
,
in
case
<EOS>
I
'm
cross
with
yer
,
"
said
Noah
,
disengaging
himself
with
great
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
be
the
captain
of
some
band
,
and
have
the
whopping
of
'em
,
and
follering
'em
about
,
unbeknown
to
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
That
would
suit
me
,
if
there
was
good
profit
;
and
if
we
could
only
get
in
with
some
gentleman
of
this
sort
,
I
say
it
would
be
cheap
at
that
twenty
-
pound
note
you
've
got
,
---
especially
as
we
do
n't
very
well
know
how
to
get
rid
of
it
ourselves
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
expressing
this
opinion
,
Mr
Claypole
looked
into
the
porter
-
pot
with
an
aspect
of
deep
wisdom
;
and
having
well
shaken
its
contents
,
nodded
condescendingly
to
Charlotte
,
and
took
a
draught
,
wherewith
he
appeared
greatly
refreshed
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
meditating
another
,
when
the
sudden
opening
of
the
door
,
and
the
appearance
of
a
stranger
,
interrupted
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
stranger
was
Mr
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
And
very
amiable
he
looked
,
and
a
very
low
bow
he
made
,
as
he
advanced
,
and
setting
himself
down
at
the
nearest
table
,
ordered
something
to
drink
of
the
grinning
Barney
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
pleasant
night
,
sir
,
but
cool
for
the
time
of
year
,
"
said
Fagin
,
rubbing
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
From
the
country
,
I
see
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
yer
see
that
?
"
asked
Noah
Claypole
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
not
so
much
dust
as
that
in
London
,
"
replied
Fagin
,
pointing
from
Noah
's
shoes
to
those
of
his
companion
,
and
from
them
to
the
two
bundles
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yer
a
sharp
feller
,
"
said
Noah
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
ha
!
<EOS>
only
hear
that
,
Charlotte
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
one
need
be
sharp
in
this
town
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
the
Jew
,
sinking
his
voice
to
a
confidential
whisper
;
"
and
that
's
the
truth
.
"
   
<EOS>
Fagin
followed
up
this
remark
by
striking
the
side
of
his
nose
with
his
right
forefinger
,
---
a
gesture
which
Noah
attempted
to
imitate
,
though
not
with
complete
success
,
in
consequence
of
his
own
nose
not
being
large
enough
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
Mr
Fagin
seemed
to
interpret
the
endeavour
as
expressing
a
perfect
coincidence
with
his
opinion
,
and
put
about
the
liquor
which
Barney
reappeared
with
,
in
a
very
friendly
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
stuff
that
,
"
observed
Mr
Claypole
,
smacking
his
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
!
"
said
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
man
need
be
always
emptying
a
till
,
or
a
pocket
,
or
a
woman
's
reticule
,
or
a
house
,
or
a
mail
-
coach
,
or
a
bank
,
if
he
drinks
it
regularly
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Claypole
no
sooner
heard
this
extract
from
his
own
remarks
than
he
fell
back
in
his
chair
,
and
looked
from
the
Jew
to
Charlotte
with
a
countenance
of
ashy
palences
and
excessive
terror
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mind
me
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Fagin
,
drawing
his
chair
closer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
ha
!
<EOS>
it
was
lucky
it
was
only
me
that
heard
you
by
chance
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
lucky
it
was
only
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
take
it
,
"
stammered
Noah
,
no
longer
stretching
out
his
legs
like
an
independent
gentleman
,
but
coiling
them
up
as
well
as
he
could
under
his
chair
;
"
it
was
all
her
doing
;
yer've
got
it
now
,
Charlotte
,
<EOS>
yer
know
yer
have
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
matter
who
's
got
it
,
or
who
did
it
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
Fagin
,
glancing
,
nevertheless
,
with
a
hawk
's
eye
at
the
girl
and
the
two
bundles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
in
that
way
myself
,
and
I
like
you
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
what
way
?
"
asked
Mr
Claypole
,
a
little
recovering
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
that
way
of
business
,
"
rejoined
Fagin
;
"
and
so
are
the
people
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
You
've
hit
the
right
nail
upon
the
head
,
and
are
as
safe
here
as
you
could
be
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
safer
place
in
all
this
town
than
is
the
Cripples
;
that
is
,
when
I
like
to
make
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
taken
a
fancy
to
you
and
the
young
woman
;
so
I
've
said
the
word
,
and
you
may
make
your
minds
easy
.
"
   
<EOS>
Noah
Claypole
's
mind
might
have
been
at
ease
after
this
assurance
,
but
his
body
certainly
was
not
;
for
he
shuffled
and
writhed
about
,
into
various
uncouth
positions
:
 
eyeing
his
new
friend
meanwhile
with
mingled
fear
and
suspicion
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
more
,
"
said
Fagin
,
after
he
had
reassured
the
girl
,
by
dint
of
friendly
nods
and
muttered
encouragements
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
got
a
friend
that
I
think
can
gratify
your
darling
wish
,
and
put
you
in
the
right
way
,
where
you
can
take
whatever
department
of
the
business
you
think
will
suit
you
best
at
first
,
and
be
taught
all
the
others
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yer
speak
as
if
yer
were
in
earnest
,
"
replied
Noah
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
advantage
would
it
be
to
me
to
be
anything
else
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Fagin
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
have
a
word
with
you
outside
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
occasion
to
trouble
ourselves
to
move
,
"
said
Noah
,
getting
his
legs
by
gradual
degrees
abroad
again
.
<EOS>
"
She
'll
take
the
luggage
upstairs
the
while
.
 
<EOS>
Charlotte
,
see
to
them
bundles
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
mandate
,
which
had
been
delivered
with
great
majesty
,
was
obeyed
without
the
slightest
demur
;
and
Charlotte
made
the
best
of
her
way
off
with
the
packages
while
Noah
held
the
door
open
and
watched
her
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
's
kept
tolerably
well
under
,
ai
n't
she
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
as
he
resumed
his
seat
:
 
in
the
tone
of
a
keeper
who
had
tamed
some
wild
animal
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
perfect
,
"
rejoined
Fagin
,
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
genius
,
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
suppose
if
I
was
n't
,
I
should
n't
be
here
,
"
replied
Noah
.
<EOS>
"
But
,
I
say
,
she
'll
be
back
if
yer
lose
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
what
do
you
think
?
"
said
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
was
to
like
my
friend
,
could
you
do
better
than
join
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
in
a
good
way
of
business
;
that
's
where
it
is
!
"
responded
Noah
,
winking
one
of
his
little
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

asked
Mr

<EOS>
"
Not

<EOS>
I
do

run
rather
short

just
now

"
replied
Fagin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Should
I
have
to
hand
over
?
"
said
Noah
,
slapping
his
breeches
-
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
could
n't
possibly
be
done
without

"
replied
Fagin
,
in
a
most
decided
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twenty

<EOS>

Not

Fagin

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Payment
stopped

<EOS>
Ah

<EOS>
It
's
not
worth
much
to
him

<EOS>
It
'll
have
to
go
abroad

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
could
I
see
him

"
asked
Noah
doubtfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where

"
   
"
Here

<EOS>

said
Noah
.
 
<EOS>
"
What

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Live

free

half

"
replied
Mr
Fagin
.
   
<EOS>
Whether
Noah
Claypole
,
whose
rapacity
was
none
of
the
least
comprehensive
,
would
have
acceded
even
to
these
glowing
terms
,
had
he
been
a
perfectly
free
agent
,
is
very
doubtful
;
but
as
he
recollected
that
,
in
the
event
of
his
refusal
,
it
was
in
the
power
of
his
new
acquaintance
to
give
him
up
to
justice
immediately
(
and
more
unlikely
things
had
come
to
pass
)
,
he
gradually
relented
,
and
said
he
thought
that
would
suit
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
,
yer
see
,
"
observed
Noah
,
"
as
she
will
be
able
to
do
a
good
deal
,
I
should
like
to
take
something
very
light
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
little
fancy
work
?
"
suggested
Fagin
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
something
of
that
sort
,
"
replied
Noah
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
would
suit
me
now
?
 
<EOS>
Something
not
too
trying
for
the
strength
,
and
not
very
dangerous
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
sort
of
thing
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
heard
you
talk
of
something
in
the
spy
way
upon
the
others
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
friend
wants
somebody
who
would
do
that
well
,
very
much
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
did
mention
that
,
and
I
should
n't
mind
turning
my
hand
to
it
sometimes
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Claypole
slowly
;
"
but
it
would
n't
pay
by
itself
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
!
"
<EOS>
observed
the
Jew
,
ruminating
or
pretending
to
ruminate
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
might
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
,
then
?
"
asked
Noah
,
anxiously
regarding
him
.
<EOS>
"
Something
in
the
sneaking
way
,
where
it
was
pretty
sure
work
,
and
not
much
more
risk
than
being
at
home
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
the
old
ladies
?
"
asked
Fagin
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
good
deal
of
money
made
in
snatching
their
bags
and
parcels
,
and
running
round
the
corner
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
they
holler
out
a
good
deal
,
and
scratch
sometimes
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Noah
,
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
that
would
answer
my
purpose

<EOS>
Ai
n't
there
any
other
line
open
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Stop
!
"
said
Fagin
,
laying
his
hand
on
Noah
's
knee
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
kinchin
lay
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
kinchins
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Fagin
,
"
is
the
young
children
that
's
sent
on
errands
by
their
mothers
,
with
sixpences
and
shillings
;
and
the
lay
is
just
to
take
their
money
away
<EOS>
---
they
've
always
got
it
ready
in
their
hands
,
---
then
knock
'em
into
the
kennel
,
and
walk
off
very
slow
,
as
if
there
were
nothing
else
the
matter
but
a
child
fallen
down
and
hurt
itself
.
 
<EOS>
Ha

<EOS>
ha

<EOS>

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha

"
roared
Mr
Claypole
,
kicking
up
his
legs
in
an
ecstasy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
,
that
's
the
very
thing
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
it
is
,
"
replied
Fagin
;
"
and
you
can
have
a
few
good
beats
chalked
out
in
Camden
Town
,
and
Battle
Bridge
,
and
neighborhoods
like
that
,
where
they
're
always
going
errands

and
you
can
upset
as
many
kinchins
as
you

any
hour
in

<EOS>
Ha

<EOS>
ha

<EOS>

"
   
<EOS>
With
this
,
Fagin
poked
Mr
Claypole
in
the
side
,
and
they
joined
in
a
burst
of
laughter
both
long
and
loud
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well

that
's
all
right

<EOS>
said
Noah
,
when
he
had
recovered
himself
,
and
Charlotte
had
returned

<EOS>
"
What
time
to

we
say

<EOS>
"
   
"
Will
ten
do

asked
Fagin
,
adding
,
as
Mr
Claypole
nodded
assent
,
"
<EOS>
What

<EOS>
shall
I
tell

"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr

replied
Noah

who
had
prepared
himself
for

<EOS>
"
Mr

bowing
with
grotesque
politeness

<EOS>
"
I
hope

better
very

thundered
Mr

<EOS>
"
Yes

"
replied
Mrs
Bolter
,
extending
her
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
calls
me
Noah

as
a
sort
of
fond
way
of
talking

said
Mr
Morris
Bolter
,
late
Claypole
,
turning
to
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
understand

"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
I
understand

perfectly

replied
Fagin

telling
the

With

adieus

Mr
Fagin
went
his
way
.
<EOS>
Noah
Claypole
,
bespeaking
his
good
lady
's
attention
,
proceeded
to
enlighten
her
relative
to
the
arrangement
he
had
made
,
with
all
that
haughtiness
and
air
of
superiority
,
becoming
,
not
only
a
member
of
the
sterner
sex
,
but
a
gentleman
who
appreciated
the
dignity
of
a
special
appointment
on

in
London

its
vicinity

"
<EOS>
asked
Mr
Claypole
,
<EOS>
otherwise
Bolter
,
when
,
by
virtue
of
the
compact
entered
into
between

,
he
had
removed
next
day
to
Fagin
's
house

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
Every

replied
Fagin
,
with
his
most
insinuating
grin

<EOS>
"
He

as
good
a
one
as
himself

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Except
sometimes

replied
Morris
Bolter
,
assuming
the
air
of
a
man
of
the
world

<EOS>
"
Some
people
are
nobody

enemies

their

yer

"
   
"
Do
n't
believe

"
said
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
a
man
's
his
own
enemy

it
's
only
because
he
's
too
much
his

not
because
he
's
careful
for
everybody

himself

Pooh

There
oughn't

Mr

That
stands
to
reason

cried
Mr

<EOS>
"
In

said
Fagin
,
who
felt
it
necessary
to
qualify
this
position
,
"
we
have
a
general
number
one

considering
me

<EOS>
"
Oh

exclaimed
Mr

<EOS>
"
You
see

pursued
Fagin
,
affecting
to
disregard
this
interruption
,
"
we
are
so
mixed
up
together
,
and
identified
in
our
interests

that
it

be
so

<EOS>
For
instance

it

your
object

meaning
yourself

Mr

"
Number

said
Mr

was
largely
endowed

the
quality
of
selfishness

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No

<EOS>
retorted
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>

I

interrupted
Mr

shrugging

<EOS>
You

what
at

<EOS>
Mr

put
his

to
his
neckerchief

as

inconveniently
tight

assent

The

continued
Fagin

"
the

on
the
broad
highway
.
 
<EOS>
To
keep
in
the
easy
road
,
and
keep
it
at
a
distance
,
is
object
number
one
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
is
,
"
replied
Mr
Bolter
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
yer
talk
about
such
things
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
to
show
you
my
meaning
clearly
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
raising
his
eyebrows
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
able
to
do
that
,
you
depend
upon
me
.
<EOS>
To
keep
my
little
business
all
snug
,
I
depend
upon
you
.
<EOS>
The
first
is
your
number
one
,
the
second
my
number
one
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
you
value
your
number
one
,
the
more
careful
you
must
be
of
mine
;
so
we
come
at
last
to
what
I
told
you
at
first
---
that
a
regard
for
number
one
holds
us
all
together
,
and
must
do
so
,
unless
we
would
all
go
to
pieces
in
company
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Bolter
,
thoughtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
yer
a
cunning
old
codger
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Fagin
saw
,
with
delight
,
that
this
tribute
to
his
powers
was
no
mere
compliment
,
but
that
he
had
really
impressed
his
recruit
with
a
sense
of
his
wily
genius
,
which
it
was
most
important
that
he
should
entertain
in
the
outset
of
their
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
To
strengthen
an
impression
so
desirable
and
useful
,
he
followed
up
the
blow
by
acquainting
him
,
in
some
detail
,
with
the
magnitude
and
extent
of
his
operations
;
blending
truth
and
fiction
together
,
as
best
served
his
purpose
;
and
bringing
both
to
bear
,
with
so
much
art
,
that
Mr
Bolter
's
respect
visibly
increased
,
and
became
tempered
,
at
the
same
time
,
with
a
degree
of
wholesome
fear
,
which
it
was
highly
desirable
to
awaken
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
this
mutual
trust
we
have
in
each
other
that
consoles
me
under
heavy
losses
,
"
said
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
best
hand
was
taken
from
me
,
yesterday
morning
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
he
died
?
"
cried
Mr
Bolter
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
replied
Fagin
,
"
not
so
bad
as
that
.
 
<EOS>
Not
quite
so
bad
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
I
suppose
he
was
---
"
   
"
Wanted
,
"
interposed
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
was
wanted
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
particular
?
"
inquired
Mr
Bolter
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Fagin
,
"
not
very
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
charged
with
attempting
to
pick
a
pocket
,
and
they
found
a
silver
snuff
-
box
on
him
,
---
his
own
,
my
dear
,
his
own
,
for
he
took
snuff
himself
,
and
was
very
fond
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
remanded
him
till
to
-
day
,
for
they
thought
they
knew
the
owner
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
he
was
worth
fifty
boxes
,
and
I
'd
give
the
price
of
as
many
to
have
him
back
.
 
<EOS>
You
should
have
known
the
Dodger
,
my
dear
;
you
should
have
known
the
Dodger
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
I
shall
know
him
,
I
hope
;
do
n't
yer
think
so
?
"
said
Mr
Bolter
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
doubtful
about
it
,
"
replied
Fagin
,
with
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
they
do
n't
get
any
fresh
evidence
,
it
'll
only
be
a
summary
conviction
,
and
we
shall
have
him
back
again
after
six
weeks
or
so
;
but
,
if
they
do
,
it
's
a
case
of
lagging
.
 
<EOS>
They
know
what
a
clever
lad
<EOS>
he
is
;
he
'll
be
a
lifer
.
 
<EOS>
They
'll
make
the
Artful
nothing
less
than
a
lifer
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
lagging
and
a
lifer
?
"
demanded
Mr
Bolter
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
good
of
talking
in
that
way
to
me
;
why
do
n't
yer
speak
so
as
I
can
understand
yer
?
"
   
<EOS>
Fagin
was
about
to
translate
these
mysterious
expressions
into
the
vulgar
tongue
;
and
,
being
interpreted
,
Mr
Bolter
would
have
been
informed
that
they
represented
that
combination
of
words
,
"
transportation
for
life
,
"
when
the
dialogue
was
cut
short
by
the
entry
of
Master
Bates
,
with
his
hands
in
his
breeches
-
pockets
,
and
his
face
twisted
into
a
look
of
semi
-
comical
woe
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
up
,
Fagin
,
"
said
Charley
,
when
he
and
his
new
companion
had
been
made
known
to
each
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
've
found
the
gentleman
as
owns
the
box
;
two
or
three
more
's
a
coming
to
"
dentify
him
;
and
the
Artful
's
booked
for
a
passage
out
,
"
replied
Master
Bates
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
a
full
suit
of
mourning
,
Fagin
,
and
a
hatband
,
to
wisit
him
in
,
afore
he
sets
out
upon
his
travels
.
 
<EOS>
To
think
of
Jack
Dawkins
---
<EOS>
lummy
Jack
---
the
Dodger
---
the
Artful
Dodger
---
going
abroad
for
a
common
twopenny
-
halfpenny
sneeze
-
box
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
thought
he
'd
a
done
it
under
a
gold
watch
,
chain
,
and
seals
,
at
the
lowest
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
why
did
n't
he
rob
some
rich
old
gentleman
of
all
his
walables
,
and
go
out
as
a
gentleman
,
and
not
like
a
common
prig
,
without
no
honour
nor
glory
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
expression
of
feeling
for
his
unfortunate
friend
,
Master
Bates
sat
himself
on
the
nearest
chair
with
an
aspect
of
chagrin
and
despondency
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
talk
about
his
having
neither
honour
nor
glory
for
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Fagin
,
darting
an
angry
look
at
his
pupil
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Was
n't
he
always
the
top
-
sawyer
among
you
all
!
 
<EOS>
Is
there
one
of
you
that
could
touch
him
or
come
near
him
on
any
scent
!
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
"
   
"
Not
one
,
"
replied
Master
Bates
,
in
a
voice
rendered
husky
by
regret
;
"
not
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
what
do
you
talk
of
?
"
replied
Fagin
angrily
;
"
what
are
you
blubbering
for
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
'Cause
it
is
n't
on
the
rec
-
ord
,
is
it
?
"
said
Charley
,
chafed
into
perfect
defiance
of
his
venerable
friend
by
the
current
of
his
regrets
;
"
'cause
it
ca
n't
come
out
in
the
'
dictment
;
'cause
nobody
will
never
know
half
of
what
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
How
will
he
stand
in
the
Newgate
Calendar
?
 
<EOS>
P'raps
not
be
there
at
all

<EOS>
Oh
,
my
eye
,
my
eye
,
wot
a
blow
it
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
ha
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Fagin
,
extending
his
right
hand
,
and
turning
to
Mr
Bolter
in
a
fit
of
chuckling
which
shook
him
as
though
he
had
the
palsy
;
"
see
what
a
pride
they
take
in
their
profession
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Ai
n't
it
beautiful
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bolter
nodded
assent
,
and
Fagin
,
after
contemplating
the
grief
of
Charley
Bates
for
some
seconds
with
evident
satisfaction
,
stepped
up
to
that
young
gentleman
and
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
Charley
,
"
said
Fagin
soothingly
;
"
it
'll
come
out
,
it
'll
be
sure
to
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
They
'll
all
know
what
a
clever
fellow
he
was
;
he
'll
show
it
himself
,
and
not
disgrace
his
old
pals
and
teachers
.
 
<EOS>
Think
how
young
he
is
too
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
distinction
,
Charley
,
to
be
lagged
at
his
time
of
life
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
is
a
honour
that
is
!
"
<EOS>
said
Charley
,
a
little
consoled
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
shall
have
all
he
wants
,
"
continued
the
Jew
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
shall

kept
in

With

cried
Charley
Bates

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ay

replied
Fagin
,

I

Ah

repeated
Charley
,
rubbing
his
hands

"
I
think
I
see
him
now

cried
the
Jew
,
bending
his
eyes
upon
his
pupil

<EOS>
"
So
do
I

cried
Charley
Bates
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha

I

All
the

solemn

addressing

"
   
<EOS>
In
fact
,
Mr
Fagin
had
so
well
humoured
his
young
friend
's
eccentric
disposition
,
that
Master
Bates
,
who
had
at
first
been
disposed
to
consider
the
imprisoned
Dodger
rather
in
the
light
of
a
victim
,
now
looked
upon
him
as
the
chief
actor
in
a
scene
of
most
uncommon
and
exquisite
humour
,
and
felt
quite
impatient
for
the
arrival
of
the
time
when
his
old
companion
should
have
so
favourable
an
opportunity
of
displaying
his
abilities
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
must
know
how
he
gets
on
to
-
day
,
by
some
handy
means
or
other
,
"
said
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
go
?
"
asked
Charley
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
for
the
world
,
"
replied
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
mad
,
my
dear
,
stark
mad
,
that
you
'd
walk
into
the
very
place
where
---
No
,
Charley
,
no
.
<EOS>
One
is
enough
to
lose
at
a
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
go
yourself
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Charley
with
a
humorous
leer
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
would
n't
quite
fit
,
"
replied
Fagin
shaking
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
why
do
n't
you
send
this
new
cove
?
"
asked
Master
Bates
,
laying
his
hand
on
Noah
's
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nobody
knows
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
if
he
did
n't
mind
---
"
observed
Fagin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mind
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Charley
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
should
he
have
to
mind
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
nothing
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Fagin
,
turning
to
Mr
Bolter
,
"
really
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
dare
say
about
that
,
yer
know
,
"
observed
Noah
,
backing
towards
the
door
,
and
shaking
his
head
with
a
kind
of
sober
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
---
none
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
in
my
department
,
that
ai
n't
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
department
has
he
got
,
Fagin
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Master
Bates
,
surveying
Noah
's
lank
form
with
much
disgust
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
cutting
away
when
there
's
anything
wrong
,
and
the
eating
all
the
wittles
when
there
's
everything
right
;
is
that
his
branch
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
retorted
Mr
Bolter
;
"
and
do
n't
yer
take
liberties
with
yer
superiors
,
little
boy
,
or
yer'll
find
yerself
in
the
wrong
shop
.
"
   
<EOS>
Master
Bates
laughed
so
vehemently
at
this
magnificent
threat
,
that
it
was
some
time
before
Fagin
could
interpose
,
and
represent
to
Mr
Bolter
that
he
incurred
no
possible
danger
in
visiting
the
police
-
office
;
that
,
inasmuch
as
no
account
of
the
little
affair
in
which
he
had
engaged
,
nor
any
description
of
his
person
,
had
yet
been
forwarded
to
the
metropolis
,
it
was
very
probable
that
he
was
not
even
suspected
of
having
resorted
to
it
for
shelter
;
and
that
,
if
he
were
properly
disguised
,
it
would
be
as
safe
a
spot
for
him
to
visit
as
any
in
London
,
inasmuch
as
it
would
be
,
of
all
places
,
the
very
last
,
to
which
he
could
be
supposed
likely
to
resort
of
his
own
free
will
.
   
<EOS>
Persuaded
,
in
part
,
by
these
representations
,
but
overborne
in
a
much
greater
degree
by
his
fear
of
Fagin
,
Mr
Bolter
at
length
consented
,
with
a
very
bad
grace
,
to
undertake
the
expedition
.
<EOS>
By
Fagin
's
directions
,
he
immediately
substituted
for
his
own
attire
,
a
waggoner
's
frock
,
velveteen
breeches
,
and
leather
leggings
:
 
all
of
which
articles
the
Jew
had
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
likewise
furnished
with
a
felt
hat
well
garnished
with
turnpike
tickets
;
and
a
carter
's
whip
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
equipped
,
he
was
to
saunter
into
the
office
,
<EOS>
as
some
country
fellow
from
Covent
Garden
market
might
be
supposed
to
do
for
the
gratification
of
his
curiousity
;
and
as
he
was
as
awkward
,
ungainly
,
and
raw
-
boned
a
fellow
as
need
be
,
Mr
Fagin
had
no
fear
but
that
he
would
look
the
part
to
perfection
.
   
<EOS>
These
arrangements
completed
,
he
was
informed
of
the
necessary
signs
and
tokens
by
which
to
recognise
the
Artful
Dodger
,
and
was
conveyed
by
Master
Bates
through
dark
and
winding
ways
to
within
a
very
short
distance
of
Bow
Street
.
<EOS>
Having
described
the
precise
situation
of
the
office
,
and
accompanied
it
with
copious
directions
how
he
was
to
walk
straight
up
the
passage
,
and
when
he
got
into
the
side
,
and
pull
off
his
hat
as
he
went
into
the
room
,
Charley
Bates
bade
him
hurry
on
alone
,
and
promised
to
bide
his
return
on
the
spot
of
their
parting
.
   
<EOS>
Noah
Claypole
,
or
Morris
Bolter
as
the
reader
pleases
,
punctually
followed
the
directions
he
had
received
,
which
---
Master
Bates
being
pretty
well
acquainted
with
the
locality
---
were
so
exact
that
he
was
enabled
to
gain
the
magisterial
presence
without
asking
any
question
,
or
meeting
with
any
interruption
by
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
He
found
himself
jostled
among
a
crowd
of
people
,
chiefly
women
,
who
were
huddled
together
in
a
dirty
frowsy
room
,
at
the
upper
end
of
which
was
a
raised
platform
railed
off
from
the
rest
,
with
a
dock
for
the
prisoners
on
the
left
hand
against
the
wall
,
a
box
for
the
witnesses
in
the
middle
,
and
a
desk
for
the
magistrates
on
the
right
;
the
awful
locality
last
named
,
being
screened
off
by
a
partition
which
concealed
the
bench
from
the
common
gaze
,
and
left
the
vulgar
to
imagine
(
if
they
could
)
the
full
majesty
of
justice
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
only
a
couple
of
women
in
the
dock
,
who
were
nodding
to
their
admiring
friends
,
while
the
clerk
read
some
depositions
to
a
couple
of
policemen
and
a
man
in
plain
clothes
who
leant
over
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
A
jailer
stood
reclining
against
the
dock
-
rail
,
tapping
his
nose
listlessly
with
a
large
key
,
except
when
he
repressed
an
undue
tendency
to
conversation
among
the
idlers
,
by
proclaiming
silence
;
or
looked
sternly
up
to
bid
some
woman
<EOS>
"
Take
that
baby
out
,
"
when
the
gravity
of
justice
was
disturbed
by
feeble
cries
,
half
-
smothered
in
the
mother
's
shawl
,
from
some
meagre
infant
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
smelt
close
and
unwholesome
;
the
walls
were
dirt
-
discoloured
;
and
the
ceiling
blackened
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
old
smoky
bust
over
the
mantel
-
shelf
,
and
a
dusty
clock
above
the
dock
---
<EOS>
the
only
thing
present
,
that
seemed
to
go
on
as
it
ought
;
for
depravity
,
or
poverty
,
or
an
habitual
acquaintance
with
both
,
had
left
a
taint
on
all
the
animate
matter
,
hardly
less
unpleasant
than
the
thick
greasy
scum
on
every
inaminate
object
that
frowned
upon
it
.
   
<EOS>
Noah
looked
eagerly
about
him
for
the
Dodger
;
but
although
there
were
several
women
who
would
have
done
very
well
for
that
distinguished
character
's
mother
or
sister
,
and
more
than
one
man
who
might
be
supposed
to
bear
a
strong
resemblance
to
his
father
,
nobody
at
all
answering
the
description
given
him
of
Mr
Dawkins
was
to
be
seen
.
 
<EOS>
He
waited
in
a
state
of
much
suspense
and
uncertainty
until
the
women
,
being
committed
for
trial
,
went
flaunting
out
;
and
then
was
quickly
relieved
by
the
appearance
of
another
prisoner
who
he
felt
at
once
<EOS>
could
be
no
other
than
the
object
of
his
visit
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
indeed
Mr
Dawkins
,
who
,
shuffling
into
the
office
with
the
big
coat
sleeves
tucked
up
as
usual
,
his
left
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
his
hat
in
his
right
hand
,
preceded
the
jailer
,
with
a
rolling
gait
altogether
indescribable
,
and
,
taking
his
place
in
the
dock
,
requested
in
an
audible
voice
to
know
what
he
was
placed
in
that
'
ere
disgraceful
sitivation
for
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
,
will
you
?
"
said
the
jailer
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
an
Englishman
,
ai
n't
I
?
"
rejoined
the
Dodger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
are
my
priwileges
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
get
your
privileges
soon
enough
,
"
retorted
the
jailer
,
"
and
pepper
with
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
'll
see
wot
the
Secretary
of
State
for
the
Home
Affairs
<EOS>
has
got
to
say
to
the
beaks
,
if
I
do
n't
,
"
replied
Mr
Dawkins
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
then
!
 
<EOS>
Wot
is
this
here
business
?
 
<EOS>
I
shall
thank
the
madg'strates
to
dispose
of
this
here
little
affair
,
and
not
to
keep
me
while
they
read
the
paper
,
for
I
've
got
an
appointment
with
a
genelman
in
the
City
,
and
as
I
am
a
man
of
my
word
and
wery
punctual
in
business
matters
,
he
'll
go
away
if
I
ai
n't
there
to
my
time
,
and
then
pr'aps
<EOS>
ther
wo
n't
be
an
action
for
damage
against
them
as
kep
me
away
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
no
,
certainly
not
!
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
point
,
the
Dodger
,
with
a
show
of
being
very
particular
with
a
view
to
proceedings
to
be
had
thereafter
,
desired
the
jailer
to
communicate
"
the
names
of
them
two
files
as
was
on
the
bench
.
"
 
<EOS>
Which
so
tickled
the
spectators
,
that
they
laughed
almost
as
heartily
as
Master
Bates
could
have
done
if
he
had
heard
the
request
.
   
<EOS>
"
Silence
there
!
"
cried
the
jailer
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
one
of
the
magistrates
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
pick
-
pocketing
case
,
your
worship
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Has
the
boy
ever
been
here
before
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
ought
to
have
been
,
a
many
times
,
"
replied
the
jailer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
been
pretty
well
everywhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
I
\
know
him
<EOS>
well
,
your
worship
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
know
me
,
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
Artful
,
making
a
note
of
the
statement
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wery
good
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
a
case
of
deformation
of
character
,
any
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Here
there
was
another
laugh
,
and
another
cry
of
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
then
,
where
are
the
witnesses
?
"
said
the
clerk
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
that
's
right
,
"
added
the
Dodger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
are
they
?
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
wish
was
immediately
gratified
,
for
a
policeman
stepped
forward
who
had
seen
the
prisoner
attempt
the
pocket
of
an
unknown
gentleman
in
a
crowd
,
and
indeed
take
a
handkerchief
therefrom
,
which
,
being
a
very
old
one
,
he
deliberately
put
back
again
,
after
trying
in
on
his
own
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
reason
,
he
took
the
Dodger
into
custody
as
soon
as
he
could
get
near
him
,
and
the
said
Dodger
,
being
searched
,
had
upon
his
person
a
silver
snuff
-
box
,
with
the
owner
's
name
engraved
upon
the
lid
.
 
<EOS>
This
gentleman
had
been
discovered
on
reference
to
the
Court
Guide
,
and
being
then
and
there
present
,
swore
that
the
snuff
-
box
was
his
,
and
that
he
had
missed
it
on
the
previous
day
,
the
moment
he
had
disengaged
himself
from
the
crowd
before
referred
to
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
also
remarked
a
young
gentleman
in
the
throng
,
particularly
active
in
making
his
way
about
,
and
that
young
gentleman
was
the
prisoner
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
anything
to
ask
this
witness
,
boy
?
"
said
the
magistrate
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
abase
myself
by
descending
to
hold
no
conversation
with
him
"
replied
the
Dodger
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
anything
to
say
at
all
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
his
worship
ask
if
you
've
anything
to
say
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
jailer
,
nudging
the
silent
Dodger
with
his
elbow
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
said
the
Dodger
,
looking
up
with
an
air
of
abstraction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
redress
yourself
to
me
,
my
man
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
such
an
out
-
and
-
out
young
wagabond
,
your
worship
,
"
observed
the
officer
with
a
grin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
say
anything
,
you
young
shaver
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
the
Dodger
,
"
not
here
,
for
this
ai
n't
the
shop
for
justice
:
 
<EOS>
besides
which
,
my
attorney
is
a
-
breakfasting
this
morning
with
the
Wice
President
of
the
House
of
Commons
;
but
I
shall
have
something
to
say
elsewhere
,
and
so
will
he
,
and
so
will
a
wery
numerous
and
'
spectable
circle
of
acquaintance
<EOS>
as'll
make
them
beaks
wish
they
'd
never
been
born
,
or
that
they
'd
got
their
footmen
to
hang
'em
up
to
their
own
hat
-
pegs
<EOS>
,
afore
they
let
'em
come
out
this
morning
to
try
it
on
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
There
!
 
<EOS>
He
's
fully
committed
!
<EOS>
"
interposed
the
clerk
.
<EOS>
"
Take
him
away
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
on
,
"
said
the
jailer
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
ah
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
come
on
,
"
replied
the
Dodger
,
brushing
his
hat
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
(
to
the
Bench
)
<EOS>
it
's
no
use
your
looking
frightened
;
I
wo
n't
show
you
no
mercy
,
not
a
ha'porth
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
YOU'LL
pay
for
this
,
my
fine
fellers
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
be
you
for
something
!
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
go
free
,
now
,
if
you
was
to
fall
down
on
your
knees
and
ask
me
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
carry
me
off
to
prison
!
 
<EOS>
Take
me
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
last
words
,
the
Dodger
suffered
himself
to
be
led
off
by
the
collar
;
threatening
,
till
he
got
into
the
yard
,
to
make
a
parliamentary
business
of
it
;
and
then
grinning
in
the
officer
's
face
,
with
great
glee
and
self
-
approval
.
   
<EOS>
Having
seen
him
locked
up
by
himself
in
a
little
cell
,
Noah
made
the
best
of
his
way
back
to
where
he
had
left
Master
Bates
.
<EOS>
After
waiting
here
some
time
,
he
was
joined
by
that
young
gentleman
,
who
had
prudently
abstained
from
showing
himself
until
he
had
looked
carefully
abroad
from
a
snug
retreat
,
and
ascertained
that
his
new
friend
had
not
been
followed
by
any
impertinent
person
.
   
<EOS>
The
two
hastened
back
together
,
to
bear
to
Mr
Fagin
the
animating
news
that
the
Dodger
was
doing
full
justice
to
his
bringing
-
up
,
and
establishing
for
himself
a
glorious
reputation
.

Chapter
44
.
<EOS>
The
time
arrives
for
Nancy
to
redeem
her
pledge
to
Rose
Maylie
.
<EOS>
She
fails
.
 
<EOS>
Adept
as
she
was
,
in
all
the
arts
of
cunning
and
dissimulation
,
the
girl
Nancy
could
not
wholly
conceal
the
effect
which
the
knowledge
of
the
step
she
had
taken
,
wrought
upon
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
She
remembered
that
both
the
crafty
Jew
and
the
brutal
Sikes
had
confided
to
her
schemes
,
which
had
been
hidden
from
all
others
:
in
the
full
confidence
that
she
was
trustworthy
and
beyond
the
reach
of
their
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
Vile
as
those
schemes
were
,
desperate
as
were
their
originators
,
and
bitter
as
were
her
feelings
towards
Fagin
,
who
had
led
her
,
step
by
step
,
deeper
and
deeper
down
into
an
abyss
of
crime
and
misery
,
<EOS>
whence
was
no
escape
;
still
,
there
were
times
when
,
even
towards
him
,
she
felt
some
relenting
,
lest
her
disclosure
should
bring
him
within
the
iron
grasp
he
had
so
long
eluded
,
and
he
should
fall
at
last
---
richly
as
he
merited
such
a
fate
---
by
her
hand
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
these
were
the
mere
wanderings
of
a
mind
unwholly
to
detach
itself
from
old
companions
and
associations
,
though
enabled
to
fix
itself
steadily
on
one
object
,
and
resolved
not
to
be
turned
aside
by
any
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
Her
fears
for
Sikes
would
have
been
more
powerful
inducements
to
recoil
while
there
was
yet
time
;
but
she
had
stipulated
that
her
secret
should
be
rigidly
kept
,
she
had
dropped
no
clue
which
could
lead
to
his
discovery
,
she
had
refused
,
even
for
his
sake
,
a
refuge
from
all
the
guilt
and
wretchedness
that
encompasses
her
---
and
what
more
could
she
do
!
<EOS>
She
was
resolved
.
   
<EOS>
Though
all
her
mental
struggles
terminated
in
this
conclusion
,
they
forced
themselves
upon
her
,
again
and
again
,
and
left
their
traces
too
.
 
<EOS>
She
grew
pale
and
thin
,
even
within
a
few
days
.
 
<EOS>
At
times
,
she
took
no
heed
of
what
was
passing
before
her
,
or
no
part
in
conversations
where
once
,
she
would
have
been
the
loudest
.
 
<EOS>
At
other
times
,
she
laughed
without
merriment
,
and
was
noisy
without
a
moment
afterwards
---
she
sat
silent
and
dejected
,
brooding
with
her
head
upon
her
hands
,
while
the
very
effort
by
which
she
roused
herself
,
told
,
more
forcibly
than
even
these
indications
,
that
she
was
ill
at
ease
,
and
that
her
thoughts
were
occupied
with
matters
very
different
and
distant
from
those
in
the
course
of
discussion
by
her
companions
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
Sunday
night
,
and
the
bell
of
the
nearest
church
struck
the
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Sikes
and
the
Jew
were
talking
,
but
they
paused
to
listen
.
 
<EOS>
The
girl
looked
up
from
the
low
seat
on
which
she
crouched
,
and
listened
too
.
 
<EOS>
Eleven
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
hour
this
side
of
midnight
,
"
said
Sikes
,
raising
the
blind
to
look
out
and
returning
to
his
seat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dark
and
heavy
<EOS>
it
is
too
.
<EOS>
A
good
night
for
business
this
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
replied
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
pity
,
Bill
,
my
dear
,
that
there
's
none
quite
ready
to
be
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
right
for
once
,
"
replied
Sikes
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
pity
,
for
I
'm
in
the
humour
too
.
"
   
<EOS>
Fagin
sighed
,
and
shook
his
head
despondingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
must
make
up
for
lost
time
when
we
've
got
things
into
a
good
train
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
I
know
,
"
said
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
way
to
talk
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
Fagin
,
venturing
to
pat
him
on
the
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
does
me
good
to
hear
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
you
good
,
does
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
so
be
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
<EOS>
laughed
Fagin
,
as
if
he
were
relieved
by
even
this
concession
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
like
yourself
to
-
night
,
Bill
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
like
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
feel
like
myself
when
you
lay
that
withered
old
claw
on
my
shoulder
,
so
take
it
away
,
"
said
Sikes
,
casting
off
the
Jew
's
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
make
you
nervous
,
Bill
,
---
reminds
you
of
being
nabbed
,
does
it
?
"
<EOS>
said
Fagin
,
determined
not
to
be
offended
.
   
<EOS>
"
Reminds
me
of
being
nabbed
by
the
devil
,
"
returned
Sikes
.
<EOS>
"
There
never
was
another
man
with
such
a
face
as
yours
,
unless
it
was
your
father
,
and
I
suppose
HE
is
singeing
his
grizzled
red
beard
by
this
time
,
unless
you
came
straight
from
the
old
'
un
without
any
father
at
all
betwixt
you
;
which
I
should
n't
wonder
at
,
a
bit
.
"
   
<EOS>
Fagin
offered
no
reply
to
this
compliment
:
 
but
,
pulling
Sikes
by
the
sleeve
,
pointed
his
finger
towards
Nancy
,
who
had
taken
advantage
of
the
foregoing
conversation
to
put
on
her
bonnet
,
and
was
now
leaving
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hallo
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nance
.
 
<EOS>
Where
's
the
gal
going
to
at
this
time
of
night
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Not
far
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
answer
's
that
?
"
retorted
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
where
,
"
replied
the
girl
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
do
,
"
said
Sikes
,
more
in
the
spirit
of
obstinacy
than
because
he
had
any
real
objection
to
the
girl
going
where
she
listed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nowhere
.
 
<EOS>
Sit
down
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
you
that
before
,
"
rejoined
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
a
breath
of
air
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Put
your
head
out
of
the
winder
,
"
replied
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
not
enough
there
,
"
said
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
it
in
the
street
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
wo
n't
have
it
,
"
replied
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
With
which
assurance
he
rose
,
locked
the
door
,
took
the
key
out
,
and
pulling
her
bonnet
from
her
head
,
flung
it
up
to
the
top
of
an
old
press
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
said
the
robber
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
stop
quietly
where
you
are
,
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
such
a
matter
as
a
bonnet
would
keep
me
,
"
said
the
girl
turning
very
pale
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
Bill
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
what
you
're
doing
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Know
what
I
'm
---
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
cried
Sikes
,
turning
to
Fagin
<EOS>
,
"
she
's
out
of
her
senses
,
you
know
,
or
she
dare
n't
talk
to
me
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
drive
me
on
the
something
desperate
,
"
muttered
the
girl
placing
both
hands
upon
her
breast
,
as
though
to
keep
down
by
force
some
violent
outbreak
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
,
will
you
,
---
this
minute
---
this
instant
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
to
let
me
go
,
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
better
.
 
<EOS>
It
'll
be
better
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
me
?
"
cried
Nancy
stamping
her
foot
upon
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hear
you
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Sikes
turning
round
in
his
chair
to
confront
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
 
<EOS>
And
if
I
hear
you
for
half
a
minute
longer
,
the
dog
shall
have
such
a
grip
on
your
throat
<EOS>
as'll
tear
some
of
that
screaming
voice
out
.
 
<EOS>
Wot
has
come
over
you
,
you
jade
!
 
<EOS>
Wot
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
,
"
said
the
girl
with
great
earnestness
;
then
sitting
herself
down
on
the
floor
,
before
the
door
,
she
said
,
"
Bill
,
let
me
go
;
you
do
n't
know
what
you
are
doing
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
For
only
one
hour
---
do
---
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cut
my
limbs
off
one
by
one
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sikes
,
seizing
her
roughly
by
the
arm
,
"
<EOS>
If
I
do
n't
think
the
gal
's
stark
raving
mad
.
 
<EOS>
Get
up
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
till
you
let
me
go
<EOS>
---
not
till
you
let
me
go
---
<EOS>
Never
---
never
!
"
screamed
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Sikes
looked
on
,
for
a
minute
,
watching
his
opportunity
,
and
suddenly
pinioning
her
hands
dragged
her
,
struggling
and
wrestling
with
him
by
the
way
,
into
a
small
room
adjoining
,
where
he
sat
himself
on
a
bench
,
and
thrusting
her
into
a
chair
,
held
her
down
by
force
.
 
<EOS>
She
struggled
and
implored
by
turns
until
twelve
o'clock
had
struck
,
and
then
,
wearied
and
exhausted
,
ceased
to
contest
the
point
any
further
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
caution
,
backed
by
many
oaths
,
to
make
no
more
efforts
to
go
out
that
night
,
Sikes
left
her
to
recover
at
leisure
and
rejoined
Fagin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Whew
!
"
said
the
housebreaker
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wot
a
precious
strange
gal
that
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
say
that
,
Bill
,
"
replied
Fagin
thoughtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
say
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
did
she
take
it
into
her
head
to
go
out
to
-
night
for
,
do
you
think
?
"
asked
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
;
you
should
know
her
better
than
me
.
<EOS>
Wot
does
is
mean
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Obstinacy
;
woman
's
obstinacy
,
I
suppose
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
suppose
it
is
,
"
growled
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
had
tamed
her
,
but
she
's
as
bad
as
ever
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Worse
,
"
said
Fagin
thoughtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
knew
her
like
this
,
for
such
a
little
cause
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
I
,
"
said
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
's
got
a
touch
of
that
fever
in
her
blood
yet
,
and
it
wo
n't
come
out
---
eh
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Like
enough
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
let
her
a
little
blood
,
without
troubling
the
doctor
,
if
she
's
took
that
way
again
,
"
said
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
Fagin
nodded
an
expressive
approval
of
this
mode
of
treatment
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
was
hanging
about
me
all
day
,
and
night
too
,
when
I
was
stretched
on
my
back
;
and
you
,
like
a
blackhearted
wolf
as
you
are
,
kept
yourself
aloof
,
"
said
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
was
poor
too
,
all
the
time
,
and
I
think
,
one
way
or
other
,
it
's
worried
and
fretted
her
;
and
that
being
shut
up
here
so
long
has
made
her
restless
---
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
the
Jew
in
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
uttered
these
words
,
the
girl
herself
appeared
and
resumed
her
former
seat
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
swollen
and
red
;
she
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
;
tossed
her
head
;
and
,
after
a
little
time
,
burst
out
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
now
she
's
on
the
other
tack
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Sikes
,
turning
a
look
of
excessive
surprise
on
his
companion
.
   
<EOS>
Fagin
nodded
to
him
to
take
no
further
notice
just
then
;
and
,
in
a
few
minutes
,
the
girl
subsided
into
her
accustomed
demeanour
.
<EOS>
Whispering
Sikes
that
there
was
no
fear
of
her
relapsing
,
Fagin
took
up
his
hat
and
bade
him
good
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
paused
when
he
reached
the
room
-
door
,
and
looking
round
,
asked
if
somebody
would
light
him
down
the
dark
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Light
him
down
,
"
said
Sikes
,
who
was
filling
his
pipe
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
pity
he
should
break
his
neck
himself
,
and
disappoint
the
sight
-
seers
.
 
<EOS>
Show
him
a
light
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nancy
followed
the
old
man
downstairs
,
with
a
candle
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
reached
the
passage
,
he
laid
his
finger
on
his
lip
,
and
drawing
close
to
the
girl
,
said
,
in
a
whisper
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
,
Nancy
,
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
replied
the
girl
,
in
the
same
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
reason
of
all
this
,
"
replied
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
HE
"
---
he
pointed
with
his
skinny
fore
-
finger
up
the
stairs
---
"
is
so
hard
with
you
<EOS>
(
he
's
a
brute
,
Nance
,
a
brute
-
beast
)
,
<EOS>
why
do
n't
you
---
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
said
the
girl
,
as
Fagin
paused
,
with
his
mouth
almost
touching
her
ear
,
and
his
eyes
looking
into
hers
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
matter
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
talk
of
this
again
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
a
friend
in
me
,
Nance
;
a
staunch
friend
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
means
at
hand
,
quiet
and
close
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
want
revenge
on
those
that
treat
you
like
a
dog
---
like
a
dog
!
 
<EOS>
worse
than
his
dog
,
for
he
humours
him
sometimes
---
come
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
come
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
the
mere
hound
of
a
day
,
but
you
know
me
of
old
,
Nance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
well
,
"
replied
the
girls
,
without
manifesting
the
least
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
shrank
back
,
as
Fagin
offered
to
lay
his
hand
on
hers
,
but
said
good
-
night
again
,
in
a
steady
voice
,
and
,
answering
his
parting
look
with
a
nod
of
intelligence
,
closed
the
door
between
them
.
   
<EOS>
Fagin
walked
towards
his
home
,
intent
upon
the
thoughts
that
were
working
within
his
brain
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
conceived
the
idea
---
not
from
what
had
just
passed
though
that
had
tended
to
confirm
him
,
but
slowly
and
by
degrees
---
that
Nancy
,
wearied
of
the
housebreaker
's
brutality
,
had
conceived
an
attachment
for
some
new
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Her
altered
manner
,
her
repeated
absences
from
home
alone
,
her
comparative
indifference
to
the
interests
of
the
gang
for
which
she
had
once
been
so
zealous
,
and
,
added
to
these
,
her
desperate
impatience
to
leave
home
that
night
at
a
particular
hour
,
all
favoured
the
supposition
,
and
rendered
it
,
to
him
at
least
,
almost
matter
of
certainty
.
 
<EOS>
The
object
of
this
new
liking
was
not
among
his
myrmidons
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
be
a
valuable
acquisition
with
such
an
assistant
as
Nancy
,
and
must
(
thus
Fagin
argued
)
be
secured
without
delay
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
another
,
and
a
darker
object
,
to
be
gained
.
 
<EOS>
Sikes
knew
too
much
,
and
his
ruffian
taunts
had
not
galled
Fagin
the
less
,
because
the
wounds
were
hidden
.
 
<EOS>
The
girl
must
know
,
well
,
that
if
she
shook
him
off
,
she
could
never
be
safe
from
his
fury
,
and
that
it
would
be
surely
wreaked
---
to
the
maiming
of
limbs
,
or
perhaps
the
loss
of
life
---
on
the
object
of
her
more
recent
fancy
.
   
<EOS>
"
With
a
little
persuasion
,
"
thought
Fagin
,
"
what
more
likely
than
that
she
would
consent
to
poison
him
?
 
<EOS>
Women
have
done
such
things
,
and
worse
,
to
secure
the
same
object
before
now
.
 
<EOS>
There
would
be
the
dangerous
villain
:
 
<EOS>
the
man
I
hate
:
 
gone
;
another
secured
in
his
place
;
and
my
influence
over
the
girl
,
with
a
knowledge
of
this
crime
to
back
it
,
unlimited
.
"
   
<EOS>
These
things
passed
through
the
mind
of
Fagin
,
during
the
short
time
he
sat
alone
,
in
the
housebreaker
's
room
;
and
with
them
uppermost
in
his
thoughts
,
he
had
taken
the
opportunity
afterwards
afforded
him
,
of
sounding
the
girl
in
the
broken
hints
he
threw
out
at
parting
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
expression
of
surprise
,
no
assumption
of
an
inability
to
understand
his
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
The
girl
clearly
comprehended
it
.
 
<EOS>
Her
glance
at
parting
showed
THAT
.
   
<EOS>
But
perhaps
she
would
recoil
from
a
plot
to
take
the
life
of
Sikes
,
and
that
was
one
of
the
chief
ends
to
be
attained
.
<EOS>
"
How
,
"
thought
Fagin
,
as
he
crept
homeward
,
"
can
I
increase
my
influence
with
her
?
 
<EOS>
what
new
power
can
I
acquire
?
"
   
<EOS>
Such
brains
are
fertile
in
expedients
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
without
extracting
a
confession
from
herself
,
he
laid
a
watch
,
discovered
the
object
of
her
altered
regard
,
and
threatened
to
reveal
the
whole
history
to
Sikes
(
of
whom
she
stood
in
no
common
fear
)
unless
she
entered
into
his
designs
,
could
he
not
secure
her
compliance
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
"
said
Fagin
,
almost
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
durst
not
refuse
me
then
.
 
<EOS>
Not
for
her
life
,
not
for
her
life
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
means
are
ready
,
and
shall
be
set
to
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
have
you
yet
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
cast
back
a
dark
look
,
and
a
threatening
motion
of
the
hand
,
towards
the
spot
where
he
had
left
the
bolder
villian
;
and
went
on
his
way
:
 
<EOS>
busying
his
bony
hands
in
the
folds
of
his
tattered
garment
,
which
he
wrenched
tightly
in
his
grasp
,
as
though
there
were
a
hated
enemy
crushed
with
every
motion
of
his
fingers
.

Chapter
45
.
<EOS>
Noah
Claypole
is
employed
by
fagin
on
a
secret
mission
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
was
up
,
betimes
,
next
morning
,
and
waited
impatiently
for
the
appearance
of
his
new
associate
,
who
after
a
delay
that
seemed
interminable
,
at
length
presented
himself
,
and
commenced
a
voracious
assault
on
the
breakfast
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bolter
,
"
said
Fagin
,
drawing
up
a
chair
and
seating
himself
opposite
Morris
Bolter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
here
I
am
,
"
returned
Noah
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
yer
ask
me
to
do
anything
till
I
have
done
eating
.
<EOS>
That
's
a
great
fault
in
this
place
.
 
<EOS>
Yer
never
get
time
enough
over
yer
meals
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
talk
as
you
eat
,
ca
n't
you
?
"
said
Fagin
,
cursing
his
dear
young
friend
's
greediness
from
the
very
bottom
of
his
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
I
can
talk
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
on
better
when
I
talk
,
"
said
Noah
,
cutting
a
monstrous
slice
of
bread
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
's
Charlotte
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Out
,
"
said
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
sent
her
out
this
morning
with
the
other
young
woman
,
because
I
wanted
us
to
be
alone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Noah
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
yer'd
ordered
her
to
make
some
buttered
toast
first
.
 
<EOS>
Well
.
 
<EOS>
Talk
away
.
 
<EOS>
Yer
wo
n't
interrupt
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
seemed
,
indeed
,
no
great
fear
of
anything
interrupting
him
,
as
he
had
evidently
sat
down
with
a
determination
to
do
a
great
deal
of
business
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
did
well
yesterday
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Beautiful
!
 
<EOS>
Six
shillings
and
ninepence
halfpenny
on
the
very
first
day
!
 
<EOS>
The
kinchin
lay
will
be
a
fortune
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
forget
to
add
three
pint
-
pots
and
a
milk
-
can
,
"
said
Mr
Bolter
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
The
pint
-
pots
were
great
strokes
of
genius
:
but
the
milk
-
can
was
a
perfect
masterpiece
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
,
I
think
,
for
a
beginner
,
"
remarked
Mr
Bolter
complacently
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
pots
I
took
off
airy
railings
,
and
the
milk
-
can
was
standing
by
itself
outside
a
public
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
it
might
get
rusty
with
the
rain
,
or
catch
cold
,
yer
know
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
Fagin
affected
to
laugh
very
heartily
;
and
Mr
Bolter
having
had
his
laugh
out
,
took
a
series
of
large
bites
,
which
finished
his
first
hunk
of
bread
and
butter
,
and
assisted
himself
to
a
second
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
,
Bolter
,
"
said
Fagin
,
leaning
over
the
table
,
"
to
do
a
piece
of
work
for
me
,
my
dear
,
that
needs
great
care
and
caution
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
rejoined
Bolter
,
"
do
n't
yer
go
shoving
me
into
danger
,
or
sending
me
any
more
o

yer

offices

<EOS>
That

so
I
tell

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
the
smallest
danger
in
it
---
not
the
very
smallest
,
"
said
the
Jew
;
"
it
's
only
to
dodge
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
An
old
woman
?
"
demanded
Mr
Bolter
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
young
one
,
"
replied
Fagin
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
that
pretty
well
,
I
know
,
"
said
Bolter
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
a
regular
cunning
sneak
when
I
was
at
school

<EOS>
What
am
I
to
dodge
her
for
?
 
<EOS>
Not
to
---
"
   
"
Not
to
do
anything
,
but
to
tell
me
where
she
goes
,
who
she
sees
,
and
,
if
possible
,
what
she
says
;
to
remember
the
street
,
if
it
is
a
street
,
or
the
house
,
if
it
is
a
house
;
and
to
bring
me
back
all
the
information
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
'll
yer
give
me
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Noah
,
setting
down
his
cup
,
and
looking
his
employer
,
eagerly
,
in
the
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
you
do
it
well
,
a
pound
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
One
pound
,
"
said
Fagin
,
wishing
to
interest
him
in
the
scent
as
much
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
that
's
what
I
never
gave
yet
,
for
any
job
of
work
where
there
was
n't
valuable
consideration
to
be
gained
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
is
she
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Noah
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
of
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
Lor
!
"
cried
Noah
,
curling
up
his
nose
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yer
doubtful
of
her
,
are
yer
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
had
found
out
some
new
friends
,
my
dear
,
and
I
must
know
who
they
are
,
"
replied
Fagin
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
"
said
Noah
.
 
<EOS>
"
Just
to
have
the
pleasure
of
knowing
them
,
if
they
're
respectable
people
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
I
'm
your
man
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
would
be
,
"
cried
Fagin
,
eleated
by
the
success
of
his
proposal
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
of
course
,
"
replied
Noah
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
she
?
<EOS>
Where
am
I
to
wait
for
her
?
 
<EOS>
Where
am
I
to
go
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
that
,
my
dear
,
you
shall
hear
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
point
her
out
at
the
proper
time
,
"
said
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
keep
ready
,
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
That
night
,
and
the
next
,
and
the
next
again
,
the
spy
sat
booted
and
equipped
in
his
carter
's
dress
:
 
ready
to
turn
out
at
a
word
from
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
Six
nights
passed
---
six
long
weary
nights
---
and
on
each
,
Fagin
came
home
with
a
disappointed
face
,
and
briefly
intimated
that
it
was
not
yet
time
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
seventh
,
he
returned
earlier
,
and
with
an
exultation
he
could
not
conceal
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Sunday
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
goes
abroad
to
-
night
,
"
said
Fagin
,
"
and
on
the
right
errand
,
I
'm
sure
;
for
she
has
been
alone
all
day
,
and
the
man
she
is
afraid
of
will
not
be
back
much
before
daybreak
.
 
<EOS>
Come
with
me
.
<EOS>
Quick
!
"
   
<EOS>
Noah
started
up
without
saying
a
word
;
for
the
Jew
was
in
a
state
of
such
intense
excitement
that
it
infected
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
left
the
house
stealthily
,
and
hurrying
through
a
labyrinth
of
streets
,
arrived
at
length
before
a
public
-
house
,
which
Noah
recognised
as
the
same
in
which
he
had
slept
,
on
the
night
of
his
arrival
in
London
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
past
eleven
o'clock
,
and
the
door
was
closed
.
 
<EOS>
It
opened
softly
on
its
hinges
as
Fagin
gave
a
low
whistle
.
<EOS>
They
entered
,
without
noise
;
and
the
door
was
closed
behind
them
.
   
<EOS>
Scarcely
venturing
to
whisper
,
but
substituting
dumb
show
for
words
,
Fagin
,
and
the
young
Jew
who
had
admitted
them
,
pointed
out
the
pane
of
glass
to
Noah
,
and
signed
to
him
to
climb
up
and
observe
the
person
in
the
adjoining
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
the
woman
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
scarcely
above
his
breath
.
   
<EOS>
Fagin
nodded
yes
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
see
her
face
well
,
"
whispered
Noah
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
looking
down
,
and
the
candle
is
behind
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
there
<EOS>
,
"
whispered
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
He
signed
to
Barney
,
who
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
,
the
lad
entered
the
room
adjoining
,
and
,
under
pretence
of
snuffing
the
candle
,
moved
it
in
the
required
position
,
and
,
speaking
to
the
girl
,
caused
her
to
raise
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
her
now
,
"
cried
the
spy
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Plainly
?
"
   
"
I
should
know
her
among
a
thousand
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
hastily
descended
,
as
the
room
-
door
opened
,
and
the
girl
came
out
.
 
<EOS>
Fagin
drew
him
behind
a
small
partition
which
was
curtained
off
,
and
they
held
their
breaths
as
she
passed
within
a
few
feet
of
their
place
of
concealment
,
and
emerged
by
the
door
at
which
they
had
entered
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hist
!
"
cried
the
lad
who
held
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dow
.
"
   
<EOS>
Noah
exchanged
a
look
with
Fagin
,
and
darted
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
the
left
,
"
whispered
the
lad
;
"
take
the
left
had
,
and
keep
od
the
other
side
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
did
so
;
and
,
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
,
saw
the
girl
's
retreating
figure
,
already
at
some
distance
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
advanced
as
near
as
he
considered
prudent
,
and
kept
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
,
the
better
to
observe
her
motions
.
<EOS>
She
looked
nervously
round
,
twice
or
thrice
,
and
once
stopped
to
let
two
men
who
were
following
close
behind
her
,
pass
on
.
 
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
gather
courage
as
she
advanced
,
and
to
walk
with
a
steadier
and
firmer
step
.
 
<EOS>
The
spy
preserved
the
same
relative
distance
between
them
,
and
followed
:
 
with
his
eye
upon
her
.
    
Chapter
46
.
<EOS>
The
appointment
kept
.
 
<EOS>
The
church
clocks
chimed
three
quarters
past
eleven
,
as
two
figures
emerged
on
London
Bridge
.
 
<EOS>
One
,
which
advanced
with
a
swift
and
rapid
step
,
was
that
of
a
woman
who
looked
eagerly
about
her
as
though
in
quest
of
some
expected
object
;
the
other
figure
was
that
of
a
man
,
who
slunk
along
in
the
deepest
shadow
he
could
find
,
and
,
at
some
distance
,
accommodated
his
pace
to
hers
:
 
stopping
when
she
stopped
:
 
and
as
she
moved
again
,
creeping
stealthily
on
:
 
but
never
allowing
himself
,
in
the
ardour
of
his
pursuit
,
to
gain
upon
her
footsteps
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
they
crossed
the
bridge
,
from
the
Middlesex
to
the
Surrey
shore
,
when
the
woman
,
apparently
disappointed
in
her
anxious
scrutiny
of
the
foot
-
passengers
,
turned
back
.
 
<EOS>
The
movement
was
sudden
;
but
he
who
watched
her
,
was
not
thrown
off
his
guard
by
it
;
for
,
shrinking
into
one
of
the
recesses
which
surmount
the
piers
of
the
bridge
,
and
leaning
over
the
parapet
the
better
to
conceal
his
figure
,
he
suffered
her
to
pass
on
the
opposite
pavement
.
<EOS>
When
she
was
about
the
same
distance
in
advance
as
she
had
been
before
,
he
slipped
quietly
down
,
and
followed
her
again
.
<EOS>
At
nearly
the
centre
of
the
bridge
,
she
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
stopped
too
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
dark
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
had
been
unfavourable
,
and
at
that
hour
and
place
there
were
few
people
stirring
.
<EOS>
Such
as
there
were
,
hurried
quickly
past
:
 
very
possibly
without
seeing
,
but
certainly
without
noticing
,
either
the
woman
,
or
the
man
who
kept
her
in
view
.
 
<EOS>
Their
appearance
was
not
calculated
to
attract
the
importunate
regards
of
such
of
London
's
destitute
population
,
as
chanced
to
take
their
way
over
the
bridge
that
night
in
search
of
some
cold
arch
or
doorless
hovel
wherein
to
lay
their
heads
;
they
stood
there
in
silence
:
 
neither
speaking
nor
spoken
to
,
by
any
one
who
passed
.
   
<EOS>
A
mist
hung
over
the
river
,
deepening
the
red
glare
of
the
fires
that
burnt
upon
the
small
craft
moored
off
the
different
wharfs
,
and
rendering
darker
and
more
indistinct
the
murky
buildings
on
the
banks
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
smoke
-
stained
storehouses
on
either
side
,
rose
heavy
and
dull
from
the
dense
mass
of
roofs
and
gables
,
and
frowned
sternly
upon
water
too
black
to
reflect
even
their
lumbering
shapes
.
<EOS>
The
tower
of
old
Saint
Saviour
's
Church
,
and
the
spire
of
Saint
Magnus
,
so
long
the
giant
-
warders
of
the
ancient
bridge
,
were
visible
in
the
gloom
;
but
the
forest
of
shipping
below
bridge
,
and
the
thickly
scattered
spires
of
churches
above
,
were
nearly
all
hidden
from
sight
.
   
<EOS>
The
girl
had
taken
a
few
restless
turns
to
and
fro
---
closely
watched
meanwhile
by
her
hidden
observer
---
when
the
heavy
bell
of
St
Paul
's
tolled
for
the
death
of
another
day
.
 
<EOS>
Midnight
had
come
upon
the
crowded
city
.
 
<EOS>
The
palace
,
the
night
-
cellar
,
the
jail
,
the
madhouse
:
 
the
chambers
of
birth
and
death
,
of
health
and
sickness
,
the
rigid
face
of
the
corpse
and
the
calm
sleep
of
the
child
:
 
midnight
was
upon
them
all
.
   
<EOS>
The
hour
had
not
struck
two
minutes
,
when
a
young
lady
,
accompanied
by
a
grey
-
haired
gentleman
,
alighted
from
a
hackney
-
carriage
within
a
short
distance
of
the
bridge
,
and
,
having
dismissed
the
vehicle
,
walked
straight
towards
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
scarcely
set
foot
upon
its
pavement
,
when
the
girl
started
,
and
immediately
made
towards
them
.
   
<EOS>
They
walked
onward
,
looking
about
them
with
the
air
of
persons
who
entertained
some
very
slight
expectation
which
had
little
chance
of
being
realised
,
when
they
were
suddenly
joined
by
this
new
associate
.
 
<EOS>
They
halted
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
,
but
suppressed
it
immediately
;
for
a
man
in
the
garments
of
a
countryman
came
close
up
---
brushed
against
them
,
indeed
---
at
that
precise
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
here
,
"
said
Nancy
hurriedly
,
"
I
am
afraid
to
speak
to
you
here
.
 
<EOS>
Come
away
---
out
of
the
public
road
---
down
the
steps
yonder
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
she
uttered
these
words
,
and
indicated
,
with
her
hand
,
the
direction
in
which
she
wished
them
to
proceed
,
the
countryman
looked
round
,
and
roughly
asking
what
they
took
up
the
whole
pavement
for
,
passed
on
.
   
<EOS>
The
steps
to
which
the
girl
had
pointed
,
were
those
which
,
on
the
Surrey
bank
,
and
on
the
same
side
of
the
bridge
as
Saint
Saviour
's
Church
,
form
a
landing
-
stairs
from
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
spot
,
the
man
bearing
the
appearance
of
a
countryman
,
hastened
unobserved
;
and
after
a
moment
's
survey
of
the
place
,
he
began
to
descend
.
   
<EOS>
These
stairs
are
a
part
of
the
bridge
;
they
consist
of
three
flights
.
 
<EOS>
Just
below
the
end
of
the
second
,
going
down
,
the
stone
wall
on
the
left
terminates
in
an
ornamental
pilaster
facing
towards
the
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
point
the
lower
steps
widen
:
 
so
that
a
person
turning
that
angle
of
the
wall
,
is
necessarily
unseen
by
any
others
on
the
stairs
who
chance
to
be
above
him
,
if
only
a
step
.
<EOS>
The
countryman
looked
hastily
round
,
when
he
reached
this
point
;
and
as
there
seemed
no
better
place
of
concealment
,
and
,
the
tide
being
out
,
there
was
plenty
of
room
,
he
slipped
aside
,
with
his
back
to
the
pilaster
,
and
there
waited
:
 
pretty
certain
that
they
would
come
no
lower
,
and
that
even
if
he
could
not
hear
what
was
said
,
he
could
follow
them
again
,
with
safety
.
   
<EOS>
So
tardily
stole
the
time
in
this
lonely
place
,
and
so
eager
was
the
spy
to
penetrate
the
motives
of
an
interview
so
different
from
what
he
had
been
led
to
expect
,
that
he
more
than
once
gave
the
matter
up
for
lost
,
and
persuaded
himself
,
either
that
they
had
stopped
far
above
,
or
had
resorted
to
some
entirely
different
spot
to
hold
their
mysterious
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
on
the
point
of
emerging
from
his
hiding
-
place
,
and
regaining
the
road
above
,
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
,
and
directly
afterwards
of
voices
almost
close
at
his
ear
.
   
<EOS>
He
drew
himself
straight
upright
against
the
wall
,
and
,
scarcely
breathing
,
listened
attentively
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
far
enough
,
"
said
a
voice
,
which
was
evidently
that
of
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
suffer
the
young
lady
to
go
any
farther
.
 
<EOS>
Many
people
would
have
distrusted
you
too
much
to
have
come
even
so
far
,
but
you
see
I
am
willing
to
humour
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
humour
me
!
"
cried
the
voice
of
the
girl
whom
he
had
followed
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
considerate
,
indeed
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
To
humour
me
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
it
's
no
matter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
for
what
,
"
said
the
gentleman
in
a
kinder
tone
,
"
for
what
purpose
can
you
have
brought
us
to
this
strange
place
?
 
<EOS>
Why
not
have
let
me
speak
to
you
,
above
there
,
where
it
is
light
,
and
there
is
something
stirring
,
instead
of
bringing
us
to
this
dark
and
dismal
hole
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
before
,
"
replied
Nancy
,
"
that
I
was
afraid
to
speak
to
you
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
it
is
,
"
said
the
girl
,
shuddering
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
such
a
fear
and
dread
upon
me
to
-
night
that
I
can
hardly
stand
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
fear
of
what
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
gentleman
,
who
seemed
to
pity
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
scarcely
know
of
what
,
"
replied
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
did
.
<EOS>
Horrible
thoughts
of
death
,
and
shrouds
with
blood
upon
them
,
and
a
fear
that
has
made
me
burn
as
if
I
was
on
fire
,
have
been
upon
me
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
reading
a
book
to
-
night
,
to
wile
the
time
away
,
and
the
same
things
came
into
the
print
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Imagination
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
soothing
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
imagination
,
"
replied
the
girl
in
a
hoarse
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
swear
I
saw
"
coffin
"
written
in
every
page
of
the
book
in
large
black
letters
,
---
aye
,
and
they
carried
one
close
to
me
,
in
the
streets
to
-
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
unusual
in
that
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
passed
me
often
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
REAL
ONES
,
"
rejoined
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
was
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
uncommon
in
her
manner
,
that
the
flesh
of
the
concealed
listener
crept
as
he
heard
the
girl
utter
these
words
,
and
the
blood
chilled
within
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
never
experienced
a
greater
relief
than
in
hearing
the
sweet
voice
of
the
young
lady
as
she
begged
her
to
be
calm
,
and
not
allow
herself
to
become
the
prey
of
such
fearful
fancies
.
   
<EOS>
"
Speak
to
her
kindly
,
"
said
the
young
lady
to
her
companion
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
creature
!
 
<EOS>
She
seems
to
need
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
haughty
religious
people
would
have
held
their
heads
up
to
see
me
as
I
am
to
-
night
,
and
preached
of
flames
and
vengeance
,
"
cried
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
lady
,
why
ar'n't
those
who
claim
to
be
God
's
own
folks
as
gentle
and
as
kind
to
us
poor
wretches
as
you
,
who
,
having
youth
,
and
beauty
,
and
all
that
they
have
lost
<EOS>
,
might
be
a
little
proud
instead
of
so
much
humbler
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
Turk
turns
his
face
,
after
washing
it
well
,
to
the
East
,
when
he
says
his
prayers
;
these
good
people
,
after
giving
their
faces
such
a
rub
against
the
World
as
to
take
the
smiles
off
,
turn
with
no
less
regularity
,
to
the
darkest
side
of
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
Between
the
Mussulman
and
the
Pharisee
,
commend
me
to
the
first
!
"
   
<EOS>
These
words
appeared
to
be
addressed
to
the
young
lady
,
and
were
perhaps
uttered
with
the
view
of
afffording
Nancy
time
to
recover
herself
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
,
shortly
afterwards
,
addressed
himself
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
were
not
here
last
Sunday
night
,
"
he
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
come
,
"
replied
Nancy
;
"
I
was
kept
by
force
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
whom
?
"
   
"
Him
that
I
told
the
young
lady
of
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
were
not
suspected
of
holding
any
communication
with
anybody
on
the
subject
which
has
brought
us
here
to
-
night
,
I
hope
?
"
asked
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
the
girl
,
shaking
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
very
easy
for
me
to
leave
him
unless
he
knows
why
;
I
could
n't
give
him
a
drink
of
laudanum
before
I
came
away
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
he
awake
before
you
returned
?
"
inquired
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
;
and
neither
he
nor
any
of
them
suspect
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
listen
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
ready
,
"
replied
the
girl
,
as
he
paused
for
a
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
young
lady
,
"
the
gentleman
began
,
"
has
communicated
to
me
,
and
to
some
other
friends
who
can
be
safely
trusted
,
what
you
told
her
nearly
a
fortnight
since
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
to
you
that
I
had
doubts
,
at
first
,
whether
you
were
to
be
implicitly
relied
upon
,
but
now
I
firmly
believe
you
are
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
"
said
the
girl
earnestly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
that
I
firmly
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
To
prove
to
you
that
I
am
disposed
to
trust
you
,
I
tell
you
without
reserve
,
that
we
propose
to
extort
the
secret
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
from
the
fear
of
this
man
Monks
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
---
if
---
"
said
the
gentleman
,
"
he
can
not
be
secured
,
or
,
if
secured
,
can
not
be
acted
upon
as
we
wish
,
you
must
deliver
up
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fagin
,
"
cried
the
girl
,
recoiling
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
man
must
be
delivered
up
by
you
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
do
it
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
never
do
it
!
"
<EOS>
replied
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Devil
that
he
is
,
and
worse
than
devil
as
he
has
been
to
me
,
I
will
never
do
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
?
"
said
the
gentleman
,
who
seemed
fully
prepared
for
this
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
returned
the
girl
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
why
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
one
reason
,
"
rejoined
the
girl
firmly
,
"
for
one
reason
,
that
the
lady
knows
and
will
stand
by
me
in
,
<EOS>
I
know
she
will
,
for
I
have
her
promise
:
 
and
for
this
other
reason
,
besides
,
that
,
bad
life
as
he
has
led
,
I
have
led
a
bad
life
too
;
there
are
many
of
us
who
have
kept
the
same
courses
together
,
and
I
'll
not
turn
upon
them
,
<EOS>
who
might
---
any
of
them
---
have
turned
upon
me
,
but
did
n't
,
bad
as
they
are
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
quickly
,
as
if
this
had
been
the
point
he
had
been
aiming
to
attain
;
"
put
Monks
into
my
hands
,
and
leave
him
to
me
to
deal
with
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
if
he
turns
against
the
others
?
"
   
"
I
promise
you
that
in
that
case
,
if
the
truth
is
forced
from
him
,
there
the
matter
will
rest
;
there
must
be
circumstances
in
Oliver
's
little
history
which
it
would
be
painful
to
drag
before
the
public
eye
,
and
if
the
truth
is
once
elicited
,
they
shall
go
scot
free
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
if
it
is
not
?
"
suggested
the
girl
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
pursued
the
gentleman
,
"
this
Fagin
shall
not
be
brought
to
justice
without
your
consent
.
 
<EOS>
In
such
a
case
I
could
show
you
reasons
,
I
think
,
which
would
induce
you
to
yield
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
I
the
lady
's
promise
for
that
?
"
asked
the
girl
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
,
"
replied
Rose
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
true
and
faithful
pledge
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Monks
would
never
learn
how
you
knew
what
you
do
?
"
said
the
girl
,
after
a
short
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
replied
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
intelligence
should
be
brought
to
bear
upon
him
,
that
he
could
never
even
guess
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
a
liar
,
and
among
liars
from
a
little
child
,
"
said
the
girl
after
another
interval
of
silence
,
"
but
I
will
take
your
words
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
After
receving
an
assurance
from
both
,
that
she
might
safely
do
so
<EOS>
,
she
proceeded
in
a
voice
so
low
that
it
was
often
difficult
for
the
listener
to
discover
even
the
purport
of
what
she
said
,
to
describe
,
by
name
and
situation
,
the
public
-
house
whence
she
had
been
followed
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
manner
in
which
she
occasionally
paused
,
it
appeared
as
if
the
gentleman
were
making
some
hasty
notes
of
the
information
she
communicated
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
thoroughly
explained
the
localities
of
the
place
,
the
best
position
from
which
to
watch
it
without
exciting
observation
,
and
the
night
and
hour
on
which
Monks
was
most
in
the
habit
of
frequenting
it
,
she
seemed
to
consider
for
a
few
moments
,
for
the
purpose
of
recalling
his
features
and
appearances
more
forcibly
to
her
recollection
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
tall
,
"
said
the
girl
,
"
and
a
strongly
made
man
,
but
not
stout
;
he
has
a
lurking
walk
;
and
as
he
walks
,
constantly
looks
over
his
shoulder
,
first
on
one
side
,
and
then
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
forget
that
,
for
his
eyes
are
sunk
in
his
head
so
much
deeper
than
any
other
man
's
,
that
you
might
almost
tell
him
by
that
alone
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
is
dark
,
like
his
hair
and
eyes
;
and
,
although
he
ca
n't
be
more
than
six
or
eight
and
twenty
,
withered
and
haggard
.
<EOS>
His
lips
are
often
discoloured
and
disfigured
with
the
marks
of
teeth
;
for
he
has
desperate
fits
,
and
sometimes
even
bites
his
hands
and
covers
them
with
wounds
---
why
did
you
start
?
"
said
the
girl
,
stopping
suddenly
.
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
replied
,
in
a
hurried
manner
,
that
he
was
not
conscious
of
having
done
so
,
and
begged
her
to
proceed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Part
of
this
,
"
said
the
girl
,
"
I
have
drawn
out
from
other
people
at
the
house
<EOS>
I
tell
you
of
,
for
I
have
only
seen
him
twice
,
and
both
times
he
was
covered
up
in
a
large
cloak
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
that
's
all
I
can
give
you
to
know
him
by
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
though
,
"
she
added
.
 
<EOS>
"
Upon
his
throat
:
 
so
high
that
you
can
see
a
part
of
it
below
his
neckerchief
when
he
turns
his
face
:
 
<EOS>
there
is
---
"
   
"
A
broad
red
mark
,
like
a
burn
or
scald
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
's
this
?
"
said
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
young
lady
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
,
and
for
a
few
moments
they
were
so
still
that
the
listener
could
distinctly
hear
them
breathe
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
do
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
breaking
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
by
your
description
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
see
.
 
<EOS>
Many
people
are
singularly
like
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
not
be
the
same
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
expressed
himself
to
this
effect
,
with
assumed
carelessness
,
he
took
a
step
or
two
nearer
the
concealed
spy
,
as
the
latter
could
tell
from
the
distinctness
with
which
he
heard
him
mutter
,
"
It
must
be
he
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
he
said
,
returning
:
 
<EOS>
so
it
seemed
by
the
sound
:
 
to
the
spot
where
he
had
stood
before
,
"
you
have
given
us
most
valuable
assistance
,
young
woman
,
and
I
wish
you
to
be
the
better
for
it
.
<EOS>
What
can
I
do
to
serve
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
replied
Nancy
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
persist
in
saying
that
,
"
rejoined
the
gentleman
,
with
a
voice
and
emphasis
of
kindness
that
might
have
touched
a
much
harder
and
more
obdurate
heart
.
<EOS>
"
Think
now
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
the
girl
,
weeping
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
do
nothing
to
help
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
past
all
hope
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
put
yourself
beyond
its
pale
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
The
past
has
been
a
dreary
waste
with
you
,
of
youthful
energies
mis
-
spent
,
and
<EOS>
such
priceless
treasures
lavished
,
as
the
Creator
bestows
<EOS>
but
once
and
never
grants
again
,
but
,
for
the
future
,
you
may
hope
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
that
it
is
in
our
power
to
offer
you
peace
of
heart
and
mind
,
<EOS>
for
that
must
come
as
you
seek
it
;
but
a
quiet
asylum
,
either
in
England
,
or
,
if
you
fear
to
remain
here
,
in
some
foreign
country
,
it
is
not
only
within
the
compass
of
our
ability
but
our
most
anxious
wish
to
secure
you
.
<EOS>
Before
the
dawn
of
morning
,
before
this
river
wakes
to
the
first
glimpse
of
day
-
light
,
you
shall
be
placed
as
entirely
beyond
the
reach
of
your
former
associates
,
and
leave
as
utter
an
absence
of
all
trace
behind
you
,
as
if
you
were
to
disappear
from
the
earth
this
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
you
go
back
to
exchange
one
word
with
any
old
companion
,
or
take
one
look
at
any
old
haunt
,
or
breathe
the
very
air
which
is
pestilence
and
death
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Quit
them
all
,
while
there
is
time
and
opportunity
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
will
be
persuaded
now
,
"
cried
the
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
hesitates
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
not
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
sir
,
I
do
not
,
"
replied
the
girl
,
after
a
short
struggle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
chained
to
my
old
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
loathe
and
hate
it
now
,
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
leave
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
gone
too
far
to
turn
back
,
---
<EOS>
and
yet
I
do
n't
know
,
for
if
you
had
spoken
to
me
so
,
some
time
ago
,
I
should
have
laughed
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
"
she
said
,
looking
hastily
round
,
"
this
fear
comes
over
me
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
go
home
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Home
!
"
repeated
the
young
lady
,
with
great
stress
upon
the
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
Home
,
lady
,
"
rejoined
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
such
a
home
as
I
have
raised
for
myself
with
the
work
of
my
whole
life
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
part
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
watched
or
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Go
!
 
<EOS>
Go
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
have
done
you
any
service
all
I
ask
is
,
that
you
leave
me
,
and
let
me
go
my
way
alone
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
useless
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
with
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
compromise
her
safety
,
perhaps
,
by
staying
here
.
 
<EOS>
We
may
have
detained
her
longer
than
she
expected
already
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
urged
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
"
cried
the
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
can
be
the
end
of
this
poor
creature
's
life
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
repeated
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
before
you
,
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
that
dark
water
.
 
<EOS>
How
many
times
do
you
read
of
such
as
I
who
spring
into
the
tide
,
and
leave
no
living
thing
,
to
care
for
,
or
bewail
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
years
hence
,
or
it
may
be
only
months
,
but
I
shall
come
to
that
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
not
speak
thus
,
pray
,
"
returned
the
young
lady
,
sobbing
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
will
never
reach
your
ears
,
dear
lady
,
and
God
forbid
such
horrors
should
!
"
replied
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
good
-
night
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
turned
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
purse
,
"
cried
the
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
it
for
my
sake
,
that
you
may
have
some
resource
in
an
hour
of
need
and
trouble
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
replied
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
done
this
for
money
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
have
that
to
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
---
give
me
something
that
you
have
worn
:
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
have
something
---
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
not
a
ring
---
<EOS>
your
gloves
or
handkerchief
---
anything
that
I
can
keep
,
as
having
belonged
to
you
,
sweet
lady
.
 
<EOS>
There
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
you
!
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
good
-
night
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
violent
agitation
of
the
girl
,
and
the
apprehension
of
some
discovery
which
would
subject
her
to
ill
-
usage
and
violence
,
seemed
to
determine
the
gentleman
to
leave
her
,
as
she
requested
.
   
<EOS>
The
sound
of
retreating
footsteps
were
audible
and
the
voices
ceased
.
   
<EOS>
The
two
figures
of
the
young
lady
and
her
companion
soon
afterwards
appeared
upon
the
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
They
stopped
at
the
summit
of
the
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
"
cried
the
young
lady
,
listening
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
she
call
!
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
heard
her
voice
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
love
,
"
replied
Mr
Brownlow
,
looking
sadly
back
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
has
not
moved
,
and
will
not
till
we
are
gone
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rose
Maylie
lingered
,
but
the
old
gentleman
drew
her
arm
through
his
,
and
led
her
,
with
gentle
force
,
away
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
disappeared
,
the
girl
sunk
down
nearly
at
her
full
length
upon
one
of
the
stone
stairs
,
and
vented
the
anguish
of
her
heart
in
bitter
tears
.
   
<EOS>
After
a
time
she
arose
,
and
with
feeble
and
tottering
steps
ascended
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
The
astonished
listener
remained
motionless
on
his
post
for
some
minutes
afterwards
,
and
having
ascertained
,
with
many
cautious
glances
round
him
,
that
he
was
again
alone
,
crept
slowly
from
his
hiding
-
place
,
and
returned
,
stealthily
and
in
the
shade
of
the
wall
,
in
the
same
manner
as
he
had
descended
.
   
<EOS>
Peeping
out
,
more
than
once
,
when
he
reached
the
top
,
to
make
sure
that
he
was
unobserved
,
Noah
Claypole
darted
away
at
his
utmost
speed
,
and
made
for
the
Jew
's
house
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
.

Chapter
47
.
<EOS>
Fatal
consequences
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
nearly
two
hours
before
day
-
break
;
that
time
which
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
,
may
be
truly
called
the
dead
of
night
;
when
the
streets
are
silent
and
deserted
;
when
even
sounds
appear
to
slumber
,
and
profligacy
and
riot
have
staggered
home
to
dream
;
it
was
at
this
still
and
silent
hour
,
that
Fagin
sat
watching
in
his
old
lair
,
with
face
so
distorted
and
pale
,
and
eyes
so
red
and
blood
-
shot
,
that
he
looked
less
like
a
man
,
than
like
some
hideous
phantom
,
moist
from
the
grave
,
and
worried
by
an
evil
spirit
.
   
<EOS>
He
sat
crouching
over
a
cold
hearth
,
wrapped
in
an
old
torn
coverlet
,
with
his
face
turned
towards
a
wasting
candle
that
stood
upon
a
table
by
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
His
right
hand
was
raised
to
his
lips
,
and
as
,
absorbed
in
thought
,
he
hit
his
long
black
nails
<EOS>
,
he
disclosed
among
his
toothless
gums
a
few
such
fangs
as
should
have
been
a
dog
's
or
rat
's
.
   
<EOS>
Stretched
upon
a
mattress
on
the
floor
,
lay
Noah
Claypole
,
fast
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
Towards
him
the
old
man
sometimes
directed
his
eyes
for
an
instant
,
and
then
brought
them
back
again
to
the
candle
;
which
with
a
long
-
burnt
wick
drooping
almost
double
,
and
hot
grease
falling
down
in
clots
upon
the
table
,
plainly
showed
that
his
thoughts
were
busy
elsewhere
.
   
<EOS>
Indeed
they
were
.
 
<EOS>
Mortification
at
the
overthrow
of
his
notable
scheme
<EOS>
;
hatred
of
the
girl
who
had
dared
to
palter
with
strangers
;
and
utter
distrust
of
the
sincerity
of
her
refusal
to
yield
him
up
;
bitter
disappointment
at
the
loss
of
his
revenge
on
Sikes
;
the
fear
of
detection
,
and
ruin
,
and
death
;
and
a
fierce
and
deadly
rage
kindled
by
all
;
these
were
the
passionate
considerations
which
,
following
close
upon
each
other
with
rapid
and
ceaseless
whirl
,
shot
through
the
brain
of
Fagin
,
as
every
evil
thought
and
blackest
purpose
lay
working
at
his
heart
.
   
<EOS>
He
sat
without
changing
his
attitude
in
the
least
,
or
appearing
to
tkae
the
smallest
heed
of
time
,
until
his
quick
ear
seemed
to
be
attracted
by
a
footstep
in
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
last
,
"
he
muttered
,
wiping
his
dry
and
fevered
mouth
.
"
<EOS>
At
last
!
"
   
The
bell
rang
gently
as
he
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
He
crept
upstairs
to
the
door
,
and
presently
returned
accompanied
by
a
man
muffled
to
the
chin
,
who
carried
a
bundle
under
one
arm
.
<EOS>
Sitting
down
and
throwing
back
his
outer
coat
,
the
man
displayed
the
burly
frame
of
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
he
said
,
laying
the
bundle
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
care
of
that
,
and
do
the
most
you
can
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
been
trouble
enough
to
get
;
I
thought
I
should
have
been
here
,
three
hours
ago
.
"
   
<EOS>
Fagin
laid
his
hand
upon
the
bundle
,
and
locking
it
in
the
cupboard
,
sat
down
again
without
speaking
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
robber
,
for
an
instant
,
during
this
action
;
and
now
that
they
sat
over
against
each
other
,
face
to
face
,
he
looked
fixedly
at
him
,
with
his
lips
quivering
so
violently
,
and
his
face
so
altered
by
the
emotions
which
had
mastered
him
,
that
the
housebreaker
involuntarily
drew
back
his
chair
,
and
surveyed
him
with
a
look
of
real
affright
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
now
?
"
cried
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wot
do
you
look
at
a
man
so
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
Fagin
raised
his
right
hand
,
and
shook
his
trembling
forefinger
in
the
air
;
but
his
passion
was
so
great
,
that
the
power
of
speech
was
for
the
moment
gone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Damme
!
"
said
Sikes
,
feeling
in
his
breast
with
a
look
of
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
gone
mad
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
look
to
myself
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
rejoined
Fagin
,
finding
his
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
---
you
're
not
the
person
,
Bill
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
no
---
<EOS>
no
fault
to
find
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
have
n't
,
have
n't
you
?
"
said
Sikes
,
looking
sternly
at
him
,
and
ostentatiously
passing
a
pistol
into
a
more
convenient
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
lucky
---
for
one
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
Which
one
that
is
,
do
n't
matter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
that
to
tell
you
,
Bill
,
"
said
Fagin
,
drawing
his
chair
nearer
,
"
will
make
you
worse
than
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
?
"
returned
the
robber
with
an
incredulous
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
away
!
<EOS>
Look
sharp
,
or
Nance
will
think
I
'm
lost
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lost
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
pretty
well
settled
that
,
in
her
own
mind
,
already
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sikes
looked
with
an
aspect
of
great
perplexity
into
the
Jew
's
face
,
and
reading
no
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
riddle
there
,
clenched
his
coat
collar
in
his
huge
hand
and
shook
him
soundly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Speak
,
will
you
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
;
"
or
if
you
do
n't
,
it
shall
be
for
want
of
breath
.
 
<EOS>
Open
your
mouth
and
say
wot
<EOS>
you
've
got
to
say
in
plain
words
.
 
<EOS>
Out
with
it
,
you
thundering
old
cur
,
out
with
it
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Suppose
that
lad
that
's
laying
there
---
"
Fagin
began
.
   
<EOS>
Sikes
turned
round
to
where
Noah
was
sleeping
,
as
if
he
had
not
previously
observed
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
resuming
his
former
position
.
   
<EOS>
"
Suppose
that
lad
,
"
pursued
Fagin
,
"
was
to
peach
---
to
blow
upon
us
all
---
first
seeking
out
the
right
folks
for
the
purpose
,
and
then
having
a
meeting
with
'em
in
the
street
to
paint
our
likenesses
,
describe
every
mark
that
they
might
know
us
by
,
and
the
crib
where
we
might
be
most
easily
taken
.
 
<EOS>
Suppose
he
was
to
do
all
this
,
and
besides
to
blow
upon
a
plant
we
've
all
been
in
,
more
or
less
---
of
his
own
fancy
;
not
grabbed
,
trapped
,
tried
,
earwigged
by
the
parson
and
brought
to
it
on
bread
and
water
,
---
<EOS>
but
of
his
own
fancy
;
to
please
his
own
taste
;
stealing
out
at
nights
to
find
those
most
interested
against
us
,
and
peaching
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
me
?
"
cried
the
Jew
,
his
eyes
flashing
with
rage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Suppose
he
did
all
this
,
what
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
then
!
"
replied
Sikes
;
with
a
tremendous
oath
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
he
was
left
alive
till
I
came
,
I
'd
grind
his
skull
under
the
iron
heel
of
my
boot
into
as
many
grains
as
there
are
hairs
upon
his
head
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
if
I
did
it
!
"
cried
Fagin
almost
in
a
yell
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
,
that
knows
so
much
,
and
could
hang
so
many
besides
myself
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
replied
Sikes
,
clenching
his
teeth
and
turning
white
at
the
mere
suggestion
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
do
something
in
the
jail
that
'
ud
get
me
put
in
irons
;
and
if
I
was
tried
along
with
you
,
I
'd
fall
upon
you
with
them
in
the
open
court
,
and
beat
your
brains
out
afore
the
people
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
such
strength
,
"
muttered
the
robber
,
poising
his
brawny
arm
,
"
that
I
could
smash
your
head
as
if
a
loaded
waggon
had
gone
over
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
I
!
"
said
the
housebreaker
.
 
<EOS>
"
Try
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
was
Charley
,
or
the
Dodger
,
or
Bet
,
or
---
"
   
"
I
do
n't
care
who
,
"
replied
Sikes
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whoever
it
was
,
I
'd
serve
them
the
same
.
"
   
<EOS>
Fagin
looked
hard
at
the
robber
;
and
,
motioning
him
to
be
silent
,
stooped
over
the
bed
upon
the
floor
,
and
shook
the
sleeper
to
rouse
him
.
 
<EOS>
Sikes
leant
forward
in
his
chair
:
 
looking
on
with
his
hands
upon
his
knees
,
as
if
wondering
much
what
all
this
questioning
and
preparation
was
to
end
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Bolter
,
Bolter
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
lad
!
<EOS>
"
said
Fagin
,
looking
up
with
an
expression
of
devilish
anticipation
,
and
speaking
slowly
and
with
marked
emphasis
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
tired
---
tired
with
watching
for
her
so
long
,
---
watching
for
her
,
Bill
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
d'ye
mean
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Sikes
,
drawing
back
.
   
<EOS>
Fagin
made
no
answer
,
but
bending
over
the
sleeper
again
,
hauled
him
into
a
sitting
posture
.
 
<EOS>
When
his
assumed
name
had
been
repeated
several
times
,
Noah
rubbed
his
eyes
,
and
,
giving
a
heavy
yawn
,
looked
sleepily
about
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
that
again
---
once
again
,
just
for
him
to
hear
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
pointing
to
Sikes
as
he
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
yer
what
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
sleepy
Noah
,
shaking
himself
pettishy
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
about
---
NANCY
,
"
said
Fagin
,
clutching
Sikes
by
the
wrist
,
as
if
to
prevent
his
leaving
the
house
before
he
had
heard
enough
.
<EOS>
"
You
followed
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
To
London
Bridge
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
she
met
two
people
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
she
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
gentleman
and
a
lady
that
she
had
gone
to
of
her
own
accord
before
,
who
asked
her
to
give
up
all
her
pals
,
and
Monks
first
,
which
she
did
---
and
to
describe
him
,
which
she
did
---
and
to
tell
her
what
house
it
was
that
we
meet
at
,
and
go
to
,
which
she
did
---
and
where
it
could
be
best
watched
from
,
which
she
did
---
and
what
time
the
people
went
there
,
which
she
did
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
all
this
.
 
<EOS>
She
told
it
all
every
word
without
a
threat
,
without
a
murmur
---
<EOS>
she
did
---
did
she
not
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Fagin
,
half
mad
with
fury
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
"
replied
Noah
,
scratching
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
just
what
it
was
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
they
say
,
about
last
Sunday
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
About
last
Sunday
!
"
replied
Noah
,
considering
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
I
told
yer
that
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Again
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
it
again
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Fagin
,
tightening
his
grasp
on
Sikes
,
and
brandishing
his
other
hand
aloft
,
as
the
foam
flew
from
his
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
asked
her
,
"
said
Noah
,
who
,
as
he
grew
more
wakeful
,
seemed
to
have
a
dawning
perception
who
Sikes
was
,
"
they
asked
her
why
she
did
n't
come
,
last
Sunday
,
as
she
promised
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
she
could
n't
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
---
why
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
him
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
she
was
forcibly
kept
at
home
by
Bill
,
the
man
she
had
told
them
of
before
,
"
replied
Noah
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
more
of
him
?
"
cried
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
more
of
the
man
she
had
told
them
of
before
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
him
that
,
tell
him
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
that
she
could
n't
very
easily
get
out
of
doors
unless
he
knew
where
she
was
going
to
,
"
said
Noah
;
"
and
so
<EOS>
the
first
time
she
went
to
see
the
lady
<EOS>
,
she
---
ha
!
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
it
made
me
laugh
when
she
said
it
,
that
it
did
---
she
gave
him
a
drink
of
laudanum
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hell
's
fire
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sikes
,
breaking
fiercely
from
the
Jew
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
!
"
   
<EOS>
Flinging
the
old
man
from
him
,
he
rushed
from
the
room
,
and
darted
,
wildly
and
furiously
,
up
the
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bill
,
Bill
!
"
cried
Fagin
,
following
him
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
word
.
<EOS>
Only
a
word
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
word
would
not
have
been
exchanged
,
but
that
the
housebreaker
was
unable
to
open
the
door
:
 
on
which
he
was
expending
fruitless
oaths
and
violence
,
when
the
Jew
came
panting
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
out
,
"
said
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
speak
to
me
;
it
's
not
safe
.
<EOS>
Let
me
out
,
I
say
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
speak
a
word
,
"
rejoined
Fagin
,
laying
his
hand
upon
the
lock
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
be
---
"
   
"
Well
,
"
replied
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
be
---
too
---
violent
,
Bill
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
day
was
breaking
,
and
there
was
light
enough
for
the
men
to
see
each
other
's
faces
.
 
<EOS>
They
exchanged
one
brief
glance
;
there
was
a
fire
in
the
eyes
of
both
,
which
could
not
be
mistaken
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
"
said
Fagin
,
showing
that
he
felt
all
disguise
was
now
useless
,
"
not
too
violent
for
safety
.
 
<EOS>
Be
crafty
,
Bill
,
and
not
too
bold
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sikes
made
no
reply
;
but
,
pulling
open
the
door
,
of
which
Fagin
had
turned
the
lock
,
dashed
into
the
silent
streets
.
   
<EOS>
Without
one
pause
,
or
moment
's
consideration
;
without
once
turning
his
head
to
the
right
or
left
,
or
raising
his
eyes
to
the
sky
,
or
lowering
them
to
the
ground
,
but
looking
straight
before
him
with
savage
resolution
:
 
his
teeth
so
tightly
compressed
that
the
strained
jaw
seemed
starting
through
his
skin
;
the
robber
held
on
his
headlong
course
,
nor
muttered
a
word
,
nor
relaxed
a
muscle
,
until
he
reached
his
own
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
opened
it
,
softly
,
with
a
key
;
strode
lightly
up
the
stairs
;
and
entering
his
own
room
,
double
-
locked
the
door
,
and
lifting
a
heavy
table
against
it
,
drew
back
the
curtain
of
the
bed
.
   
<EOS>
The
girl
was
lying
,
half
-
dressed
,
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
roused
her
from
her
sleep
,
for
she
raised
herself
with
a
hurried
and
startled
look
.
   
<EOS>
"
Get
up
!
"
said
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
you
,
Bill
!
"
said
the
girl
,
with
an
expression
of
pleasure
at
his
return
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
was
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Get
up
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
candle
burning
,
but
the
man
hastily
drew
it
from
the
candlestick
,
and
hurled
it
under
the
grate
.
 
<EOS>
Seeing
the
faint
light
of
early
day
without
,
the
girl
rose
to
undraw
the
curtain
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
it
be
,
"
said
Sikes
,
thrusting
his
hand
before
her
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
enough
light
for
wot
<EOS>
I
've
got
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bill
,
"
said
the
girl
,
in
the
low
voice
of
alarm
,
"
why
do
you
look
like
that
at
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
robber
sat
regarding
her
,
for
a
few
seconds
,
with
dilated
nostrils
and
heaving
breast
;
and
then
,
grasping
her
by
the
head
and
throat
,
dragged
her
into
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
looking
once
towards
the
door
,
placed
his
heavy
hand
upon
her
mouth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bill
,
Bill
!
"
gasped
the
girl
,
wrestling
with
the
strength
of
mortal
fear
,
---
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
wo
n't
scream
or
cry
---
not
once
<EOS>
---
hear
me
---
speak
to
me
---
tell
me
what
I
have
done
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
you
she
devil
!
"
returned
the
robber
,
suppressing
his
breath
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
were
watched
to
-
night
;
every
word
you
said
was
heard
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
spare
my
life
for
the
love
of
Heaven
,
as
I
spared
yours
,
"
rejoined
the
girl
,
clinging
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bill
,
dear
Bill
,
you
can
not
have
the
heart
to
kill
me
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
think
of
all
I
have
given
up
,
only
this
one
night
,
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
SHALL
have
time
to
think
,
and
save
yourself
this
crime
;
I
will
not
loose
my
hold
,
you
can
not
throw
me
off
.
 
<EOS>
Bill
,
Bill
,
for
dear
God
's
sake
,
for
your
own
,
for
mine
,
stop
before
you
spill
my
blood
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
true
to
you
,
upon
my
guilty
soul
I
have
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
man
struggled
violently
,
to
release
his
arms
;
but
those
of
the
girl
were
clasped
round
his
,
and
tear
her
as
he
would
,
he
could
not
tear
them
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bill
,
"
cried
the
girl
,
striving
to
lay
her
head
upon
his
breast
,
"
the
gentleman
and
<EOS>
that
dear
lady
,
told
me
to
-
night
of
a
home
in
some
foreign
country
where
I
could
end
my
days
in
solitude

Let
me
see
them
again
,
and
beg
them
,
on
my
knees
,
to
show
the
same
mercy
and
goodness
to
you
;

let
us
both
leave
this
dreadful
place

far
apart
lead
better
lives

forget
how
we
have
lived

in

more

never

told
me
so

The
housebreaker
freed
one
arm
,
and
grasped
his
pistol
.
<EOS>
The
certainty
of
immediate
detection
if
he
fired
,
flashed
across
his
mind
even
in
the
midst
of
his
fury
;
and
he
beat
it
twice
with
all
the
force
he
could
summon
,
upon
the
upturned
face
that
almost
touched
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
She
staggered
and
fell
:
 
<EOS>
nearly
blinded
with
the
blood
that
rained
down
from
a
deep
gash
in
her
forehead
;
but
raising
herself
,
with
difficulty
,
on
her
knees
,
drew
from
her
bosom
a
white
handkerchief
---
Rose
Maylie
's
own
---
and
holding
it
up
,
in
her
folded
hands
,
as
high
towards
Heaven
as
her
feeble
strength
would
allow
,
breathed
one
prayer
for
mercy
to
her
Maker
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
ghastly
figure
to
look
upon
.
 
<EOS>
The
murderer
staggering
backward
to
the
wall
,
and
shutting
out
the
sight
with
his
hand
,
seized
a
heavy
club
and
struck
her
down

The
flight
of
Sikes
.
 
<EOS>
Of
all
bad
deeds
that
,
under
cover
of
the
darkness
,
had
been
committed
with
wide
London
's
bounds
since
night
hung
over
it
,
that
was
the
worst
.
 
<EOS>
Of
all
the
horrors
that
rose
with
an
ill
scent
upon
the
morning
air
<EOS>
,
that
was
the
foulest
and
most
cruel
.
   
<EOS>
The
sun
---
the
bright
sun
,
that
brings
back
,
not
light
alone
,
but
new
life
,
and
hope
,
and
freshness
to
man
<EOS>
---
burst
upon
the
crowded
city
in
clear
and
radiant
glory
.
 
<EOS>
Through
costly
-
coloured
glass
and
paper
-
mended
window
,
through
cathedral
dome
and
rotten
crevice
,
it
shed
its
equal
ray
.
 
<EOS>
It
lighted
up
the
room
where
the
murdered
woman
lay
.
 
<EOS>
It
did
.
 
<EOS>
He
tried
to
shut
it
out
,
but
it
would
stream
in
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
sight
had
been
a
ghastly
one
in
the
dull
morning
,
what
was
it
,
now
,
in
all
that
brilliant
light
!
   
<EOS>
He
had
not
moved
;
he
had
been
afraid
to
stir
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
moan
and
motion
of
the
hand
;
and
,
with
terror
added
to
rage
,
he
had
struck
and
struck
again
.
 
<EOS>
Once
he
threw
a
rug
over
it
;
but
it
was
worse
to
fancy
the
eyes
,
and
imagine
them
moving
towards
him
,
than
to
see
them
glaring
upward
,
as
if
watching
the
reflection
of
the
pool
of
gore
that
quivered
and
danced
in
the
sunlight
on
the
ceiling
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
plucked
it
off
again
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
was
the
body
---
mere
flesh
and
blood
,
nor
more
---
but
such
flesh
,
and
so
much
blood
!
   
<EOS>
He
struck
a
light
,
kindled
a
fire
,
and
thrust
the
club
into
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
hair
upon
the
end
,
which
blazed
and
shrunk
into
a
light
cinder
,
and
,
caught
by
the
air
,
whirled
up
the
chimney
.
 
<EOS>
Even
that
frightened
him
,
sturdy
as
he
was
;
but
he
held
the
weapon
till
it
broke
,
and
then
piled
it
on
the
coals
to
burn
away
,
and
smoulder
into
ashes
.
 
<EOS>
He
washed
himself
,
and
rubbed
his
clothes
;
there
were
spots
that
would
not
be
removed
,
but
he
cut
the
pieces
out
,
and
burnt
them
.
 
<EOS>
How
those
stains
were
dispersed
about
the
room
!
 
<EOS>
The
very
feet
of
the
dog
were
bloody
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
time
he
had
,
never
once
,
turned
his
back
upon
the
corpse
;
no
,
not
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Such
preparations
completed
,
he
moved
,
backward
,
towards
the
door
:
 
dragging
the
dog
with
him
,
lest
he
should
soil
his
feet
anew
and
carry
out
new
evidence
of
the
crime
into
the
streets
.
<EOS>
He
shut
the
door
softly
,
locked
it
,
took
the
key
,
and
left
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
He
crossed
over
,
and
glanced
up
at
the
window
,
to
be
sure
that
nothing
was
visible
from
the
outside
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
curtain
still
drawn
,
which
she
would
have
opened
to
admit
the
light
she
never
saw
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
lay
nearly
under
there
.
 
<EOS>
HE
knew
that
.
 
<EOS>
God
,
how
the
sun
poured
down
upon
the
very
spot
!
   
<EOS>
The
glance
was
instantaneous
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
relief
to
have
got
free
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
whistled
on
the
dog
,
and
walked
rapidly
away
.
   
<EOS>
He
went
through
Islington
;
strode
up
the
hill
at
Highgate
on
which
stands
the
stone
in
honour
of
Whittington
;
turned
down
to
Highgate
Hill
,
unsteady
of
purpose
,
and
uncertain
where
to
go
;
struck
off
to
the
right
again
,
almost
as
soon
as
he
began
to
descend
it
;
and
taking
the
foot
-
path
across
the
fields
,
skirted
Caen
Wood
,
and
so
came
on
Hampstead
Heath
.
 
<EOS>
Traversing
the
hollow
by
the
Vale
of
Heath
,
he
mounted
the
opposite
bank
,
and
crossing
the
road
which
joins
the
villages
of
Hampstead
and
Highgate
,
made
along
the
remaining
portion
of
the
heath
to
the
fields
at
North
End
,
in
one
of
which
he
laid
himself
down
under
a
hedge
,
and
slept
.
   
<EOS>
Soon
he
was
up
again
,
and
away
,
---
not
far
into
the
country
,
but
back
towards
London
by
the
high
-
road
---
then
back
again
---
then
over
another
part
of
the
same
ground
as
he
already
traversed
---
then
wandering
up
and
down
in
fields
,
and
lying
on
ditches
'
brinks
to
rest
,
and
starting
up
to
make
for
some
other
spot
,
and
do
the
same
,
and
ramble
on
again
.
   
<EOS>
Where
could
he
go
<EOS>
,
that
was
near
and
not
too
public
,
to
get
some
meat
and
drink
?
 
<EOS>
Hendon
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
a
good
place
,
not
far
off
,
and
out
of
most
people
's
way
.
 
<EOS>
Thither
he
directed
his
steps
,
---
running
sometimes
,
and
sometimes
,
with
a
strange
perversity
,
loitering
at
a
snail
's
pace
,
or
stopping
altogether
and
idly
breaking
the
hedges
with
a
stick
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
he
got
there
,
all
the
people
he
met
---
the
very
children
at
the
doors
---
seemed
to
view
him
with
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
Back
he
turned
again
,
without
the
courage
to
purchase
bit
or
drop
,
though
he
had
tasted
no
food
for
many
hours
;
and
once
more
he
lingered
on
the
Heath
,
uncertain
where
to
go
.
   
<EOS>
He
wandered
over
miles
and
miles
of
ground
,
and
still
came
back
to
the
old
place
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
and
noon
had
passed
,
and
the
day
was
on
the
wane
,
and
still
he
rambled
to
and
fro
,
and
up
and
down
,
and
round
and
round
,
and
still
lingered
about
the
same
spot
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
got
away
,
and
shaped
his
course
for
Hatfield
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
nine
o'clock
at
night
,
when
the
man
,
quite
tired
out
,
and
the
dog
,
limping
and
lame
from
the
unaccustomed
exercise
,
turned
down
the
hill
by
the
church
of
the
quiet
village
,
and
plodding
along
the
little
street
,
crept
into
a
small
public
-
house
,
whose
scanty
light
had
guided
them
to
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
fire
in
the
tap
-
room
,
and
some
country
-
labourers
were
drinking
before
it
.
   
<EOS>
They
made
room
for
the
stranger
,
but
he
sat
down
in
the
furthest
corner
,
and
ate
and
drank
alone
,
or
rather
with
his
dog
:
 
to
whom
he
cast
a
morsel
of
food
from
time
to
time
.
   
<EOS>
The
conversation
of
the
men
assembled
here
,
turned
upon
the
neighboring
land
,
and
farmers
;
and
when
those
topics
were
exhausted
,
upon
the
age
of
some
old
man
who
had
been
buried
on
the
previous
Sunday
;
the
young
men
present
considering
him
very
old
,
and
the
old
men
present
declaring
him
to
have
been
quite
young
---
not
older
,
one
white
-
haired
grandfather
said
,
than
he
was
---
with
ten
or
fifteen
year
of
life
in
him
at
least
---
if
he
had
taken
care
;
if
he
had
taken
care
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
to
attract
attention
,
or
excite
alarm
in
this
.
<EOS>
The
robber
,
after
paying
his
reckoning
,
sat
silent
and
unnoticed
in
his
corner
,
and
had
almost
dropped
asleep
,
when
he
was
half
wakened
by
the
noisy
entrance
of
a
new
comer
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
an
antic
fellow
,
half
pedlar
and
half
mountebank
,
who
travelled
about
the
country
on
foot
to
vend
hones
,
stops
,
razors
,
washballs
,
harness
-
paste
,
medicine
for
dogs
and
horses
,
cheap
perfumery
,
cosmetics
,
and
such
-
like
wares
,
which
he
carried
in
a
case
slung
to
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
His
entrance
was
the
signal
for
various
homely
jokes
with
the
countrymen
,
which
slackened
not
until
he
had
made
his
supper
,
and
opened
his
box
of
treasures
,
when
he
ingeniously
contrived
to
unite
business
with
amusement
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what

stoof

asked
a
grinning
countryman
,
pointing
to
some
composition

cakes
in
one
corner

The
man
got
no
further
,
for
Sikes
with
a
hideous
imprecation
overthrew
the
table
,
and
tearing
the
hat
from
him
,
burst
out
of
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
With
the

perversity
of
feeling

irresolution
that

fastened
upon

himself
,
all

the
murderer
,
finding
that
he
was
not
followed
,
and
that
they
most
probably
considered
him
some
drunken
sullen
fellow
,
turned
back
up
the
town
,
and
getting
out
of
the
glare
of
the
lamps
of
a
stage
-
coach
that
was
standing
in
the
street
,
was
walking
past
,
when
he
recognised
the
mail
from
London
,
and
saw
that
it
was
standing
at
the
little
post

office

He
almost
knew
what

crossed
over

The
guard

standing

waiting
for

A

up

the
better
to
admire
the
horses
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
nothing
that
I
knows
on
,
"
replied
the
man
,
pulling
on
his
gloves
.
 
<EOS>
"
Corn
's
up
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
I
heerd
talk
of
a
murder
,
too
,
down
<EOS>
Spitalfields
way
,
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
reckon
much
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
's
quite
true
,
"
said
a
gentleman
inside
,
who
was
looking
out
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
a
dreadful
murder
it
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Was
it
,
sir
?
"
rejoined
the
guard
,
touching
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Man
or
woman
,
pray
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
woman
,
"
replied
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
supposed
---
"
   
"
Now
,
Ben
,
"
replied
the
coachman
impatiently
.
   
<EOS>
"
Damn
that
'
ere
bag
,
"
said
the
guard
;
"
are
you
gone
to
sleep
in
there
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Coming
!
"
cried
the
office
keeper
,
running
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
Coming
,
"
growled
the
guard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
and
so
's
the
young
'
ooman
of
property
that
's
going
to
take
a
fancy
to
me
,
but
I
do
n't
know
when
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
give
hold
.
 
<EOS>
All
ri
---
ight
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
horn
sounded
a
few
cheerful
notes
,
and
the
coach
was
gone
.
   
<EOS>
Sikes
remained
standing
in
the
street
,
apparently
unmoved
by
what
he
had
just
heard
,
and
agitated
by
no
stronger
feeling
than
a
doubt
where
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
went
back
again
,
and
took
the
road
which
leads
from
Hatfield
to
St
Albans
.
   
<EOS>
He
went
on
doggedly
;
but
as
he
left
the
town
behind
him
,
and
plunged
into
the
solitude
and
darkness
of
the
road
,
he
felt
a
dread
and
awe
creeping
upon
him
which
shook
him
to
the
core
.
<EOS>
Every
object
before
him
,
substance
or
shadow
,
still
or
moving
,
took
the
semblance
of
some
fearful
thing
;
but
these
fears
were
nothing
compared
to
the
sense
that
haunted
him
of
that
morning
's
ghastly
figure
following
at
his
heels
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
trace
its
shadow
in
the
gloom
,
supply
the
smallest
item
of
the
outline
,
and
note
how
stiff
and
solemn
it
seemed
to
stalk
along
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
hear
its
garments
rustling
in
the
leaves
,
and
every
breath
of
wind
came
laden
with
that
last
low
cry
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
stopped
it
did
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
ran
,
it
followed
---
not
running
too
:
 
that
would
have
been
a
relief
:
 
but
like
a
corpse
endowed
with
the
mere
machinery
of
life
,
and
borne
on
one
slow
melancholy
wind
that
never
rose
or
fell
.
   
<EOS>
At
times
,
he
turned
,
with
desperate
determination
,
resolved
to
beat
this
phantom
off
,
though
it
should
look
him
dead
;
but
the
hair
rose
on
his
head
,
and
his
blood
stood
still
,
for
it
had
turned
with
him
and
was
behind
him
then
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
kept
it
before
him
that
morning
,
but
it
was
behind
now
---
always
.
 
<EOS>
He
leaned
his
back
against
a
bank
,
and
felt
that
it
stood
above
him
,
visibly
out
against
the
cold
night
-
sky
.
 
<EOS>
He
threw
himself
upon
the
road
---
on
his
back
upon
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
At
his
head
it
stood
,
silent
,
erect
,
and
still
---
<EOS>
a
living
grave
-
stone
,
with
its
epitaph
in
blood
.
   
<EOS>
Let
no
man
talk
of
murderers
escaping
justice
,
and
hint
that
Providence
must
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
twenty
score
of
violent
deaths
in
one
long
minute
of
that
agony
of
fear
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
shed
in
a
field
he
passed
,
that
offered
shelter
for
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
Before
the
door
,
were
three
tall
poplar
trees
,
which
made
it
very
dark
within
;
and
the
wind
moaned
through
them
with
a
dismal
wail
.
 
<EOS>
He
COULD
NOT
walk
on
,
till
daylight
came
again
;
and
here
he
stretched
himself
close
to
the
wall
---
to
undergo
new
torture
.
   
<EOS>
For
now
,
a
vision
came
before
him
,
as
constant
and
more
terrible
than
that
from
which
he
had
escaped
.
 
<EOS>
Those
widely
staring
eyes
,
so
lustreless
and
so
glassy
,
that
he
had
better
borne
to
see
them
than
think
upon
them
,
appeared
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
:
light
in
themselves
,
but
giving
light
to
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
but
two
,
but
they
were
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
shut
out
the
sight
,
there
came
the
room
with
every
well
-
known
object
---
some
,
indeed
,
that
he
would
have
forgotten
,
if
he
had
gone
over
its
contents
from
memory
---
each
in
its
accustomed
place
.
 
<EOS>
The
body
was
in
ITS
place
,
and
its
eyes
were
as
he
saw
them
when
he
stole
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
got
up
,
and
rushed
into
the
field
without
.
 
<EOS>
The
figure
was
behind
him
.
<EOS>
He
re
-
entered
the
shed
,
and
shrunk
down
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
The
eyes
were
there
,
before
he
had
laid
himself
along
.
   
<EOS>
And
here
he
remained
in
such
terror
as
none
<EOS>
but
he
can
know
,
trembling
in
every
limb
,
and
<EOS>
the
cold
sweat
starting
from
every
pore
,
when
suddenly
there
arose
upon
the
night
-
wind
the
noise
of
distant
shouting
,
and
the
roar
of
voices
mingled
in
alarm
and
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
Any
sound
of
men
in
that
lonely
place
,
even
though
it
conveyed
a
real
cause
of
alarm
,
was
something
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
regained
his
strength
and
energy
at
the
prospect
of
personal
danger
;
and
springing
to
his
feet
,
rushed
into
the
open
air
.
   
<EOS>
The
broad
sky
seemed
on
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Rising
into
the
air
with
showers
of
sparks
,
and
rolling
one
above
the
other
,
were
sheets
of
flame
,
lighting
the
atmosphere
for
miles
round
,
and
driving
clouds
of
smoke
in
the
direction
where
he
stood
.
 
<EOS>
The
shouts
grew
louder
as
new
voices
swelled
the
roar
,
and
he
could
hear
the
cry
of
Fire
!
<EOS>
mingled
with
the
ringing
of
an
alarm
-
bell
,
the
fall
of
heavy
bodies
,
and
the
crackling
of
flames
as
they
twined
round
some
new
obstacle
,
and
shot
aloft
as
though
refreshed
by
food
.
 
<EOS>
The
noise
increased
as
he
looked
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
people
there
---
men
and
women
---
light
,
bustle
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
like
new
life
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
darted
onward
---
straight
,
headlong
---
dashing
through
brier
and
brake
,
and
leaping
gate
and
fence
as
madly
as
his
dog
,
who
careered
with
loud
and
sounding
bark
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
came
upon
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
half
-
dressed
figures
tearing
to
and
fro
,
some
endeavouring
to
drag
the
frightened
horses
from
the
stables
,
others
driving
the
cattle
from
the
yard
and
out
-
houses
,
and
others
coming
laden
from
the
burning
pile
,
amidst
a
shower
of
falling
sparks
,
and
the
tumbling
down
of
red
-
hot
beams
.
 
<EOS>
The
apertures
,
where
doors
and
windows
stood
an
hour
ago
,
disclosed
a
mass
of
raging
fire
;
walls
rocked
and
crumbled
into
the
burning
well
;
the
molten
lead
and
iron
poured
down
,
white
hot
,
upon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Women
and
children
shrieked
,
and
men
encouraged
each
other
with
noisy
shouts
and
cheers
.
 
<EOS>
The
clanking
of
the
engine
-
pumps
,
and
the
spirting
and
hissing
of
the
water
as
it
fell
upon
the
blazing
wood
,
added
to
the
tremendous
roar
.
 
<EOS>
He
shouted
,
too
,
till
he
was
hoarse
;
and
flying
from
memory
and
himself
,
plunged
into
the
thickest
of
the
throng
.
 
<EOS>
Hither
and
thither
<EOS>
he
dived
that
night
:
 
now
working
at
the
pumps
,
and
now
hurrying
through
the
smoke
and
flame
,
but
never
ceasing
to
engage
himself
wherever
noise
and
men
were
thickest
.
 
<EOS>
Up
and
down
the
ladders
,
upon
the
roofs
of
buildings
,
over
floors
that
quaked
and
trembled
with
his
weight
,
under
the
lee
of
falling
bricks
and
stones
,
in
every
part
of
that
great
fire
was
he
;
but
he
bore
a
charmed
life
,
and
had
neither
scratch
nor
bruise
,
nor
weariness
nor
thought
,
till
morning
dawned
again
,
and
only
smoke
and
blackened
ruins
remained
.
   
<EOS>
This
mad
excitement
over
<EOS>
,
there
returned
,
with
ten
-
fold
force
,
the
dreadful
consciousness
of
his
crime
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
suspiciously
about
him
,
for
the
men
were
conversing
in
groups
,
and
he
feared
to
be
the
subject
of
their
talk
.
 
<EOS>
The
dog
obeyed
the
significant
beck
of
his
finger
,
and
they
drew
off
,
stealthily
,
together
.
 
<EOS>
He
passed
near
an
engine
where
some
men
were
seated
,
and
they
called
to
him
to
share
in
their
refreshment
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
some
bread
and
meat
;
and
as
he
drank
a
draught
of
beer
,
heard
the
firemen
,
who
were
from
London
,
talking
about
the
murder
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
gone
to
Birmingham
,
they
say
,
"
said
one
:
 
"
but
they
'll
have
him
yet
,
for
the
scouts
are
out
,
and
by
to
-
morrow
night
there
'll
be
a
cry
all
through
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
hurried
off
,
and
walked
till
he
almost
dropped
upon
the
ground
;
then
lay
down
in
a
lane
,
and
had
a
long
,
but
broken
and
uneasy
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
He
wandered
on
again
,
irresolute
and
undecided
,
and
oppressed
with
the
fear
of
another
solitary
night
.
   
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
he
took
the
desperate
resolution
to
going
back
to
London
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
somebody
to
speak
to
there
,
at
all
event
,
"
he
thought
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
good
hiding
-
place
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
They
'll
never
expect
to
nab
me
there
,
after
this
country
scent
.
 
<EOS>
Why
ca
n't
I
lie
by
for
a
week
or
so
,
and
,
forcing
blunt
from
Fagin
,
get
abroad
to
France
?
 
<EOS>
Damme
,
I
'll
risk
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
acted
upon
this
impluse
without
delay
,
and
choosing
the
least
frequented
roads
<EOS>
began
his
journey
back
,
resolved
to
lie
concealed
within
a
short
distance
of
the
metropolis
,
and
,
entering
it
at
dusk
by
a
circuitous
route
,
to
proceed
straight
to
that
part
of
it
which
he
had
fixed
on
for
his
destination
.
   
<EOS>
The
dog
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
description
of
him
were
out
,
it
would
not
be
forgotten
that
the
dog
was
missing
,
and
had
probably
gone
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
might
lead
to
his
apprehension
as
he
passed
along
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
He
resolved
to
drown
him
,
and
walked
on
,
looking
about
for
a
pond
:
 
picking
up
a
heavy
stone
and
tying
it
to
his
handerkerchief
as
he
went
.
   
<EOS>
The
animal
looked
up
into
his
master
's
face
while
these
preparations
were
making
;
whether
his
instinct
apprehended
something
of
their
purpose
,
or
the
robber
's
sidelong
look
at
him
was
sterner
than
ordinary
,
he
skulked
a
little
farther
in
the
rear
than
usual
,
and
cowered
as
he
came
more
slowly
along
.
 
<EOS>
When
his
master
halted
at
the
brink
of
a
pool
,
and
looked
round
to
call
him
,
he
stopped
outright
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
me
call
?
 
<EOS>
Come
here
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
The
animal
came
up
from
the
very
force
of
habit
;
but
as
Sikes
stooped
to
attach
the
handkerchief
to
his
throat
,
he
uttered
a
low
growl
and
started
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
back
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
robber
.
   
<EOS>
The
dog
wagged
his
tail
,
but
moved
not
.
 
<EOS>
Sikes
made
a
running
noose
and
called
him
again
.
   
<EOS>
The
dog
advanced
,
retreated
,
paused
an
instant
,
and
scoured
away
at
his
hardest
speed
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
whistled
again
and
again
,
and
sat
down
and
waited
in
the
expectation
that
he
would
return
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
dog
appeared
,
and
at
length
he
resumed
his
journey
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
49
.
<EOS>
Monks
and
Mr
Brownlow
at
length
meet
.
 
<EOS>
Their
conversation
,
and
the
intelligence
that
interrupts
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
twilight
was
beginning
to
close
in
,
when
Mr
Brownlow
alighted
from
a
hackney
-
coach
at
his
own
door
,
and
knocked
softly
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
being
opened
,
a
sturdy
man
got
out
of
the
coach
and
stationed
himself
on
one
side
of
the
steps
,
while
another
man
,
who
had
been
seated
on
the
box
,
dismounted
too
,
and
stood
upon
the
other
side
.
 
<EOS>
At
a
sign
from
Mr
Brownlow
,
they
helped
out
a
third
man
,
and
taking
him
between
them
,
hurried
him
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
This
man
was
Monks
.
   
<EOS>
They
walked
in
the
same
manner
up
the
stairs
without
speaking
,
and
Mr
Brownlow
,
preceding
them
,
led
the
way
into
a
back
-
room
.
<EOS>
At
the
door
of
this
apartment
,
Monks
,
who
had
ascended
with
evident
reluctance
,
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
men
looked
at
the
old
gentleman
as
if
for
instructions
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
knows
the
alternative
,
"
said
Mr
Browlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
he
hesitates
or
moves
a
finger
but
as
you
bid
him
,
drag
him
into
the
street
,
call
for
the
aid
of
the
police
,
and
impeach
him
as
a
felon
in
my
name
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
say
this
of
me
?
"
asked
Monks
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
urge
me
to
it
,
young
man
?
<EOS>
"
replied
Mr
Brownlow
,
confronting
him
with
a
steady
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
mad
enough
to
leave
this
house
?
 
<EOS>
Unhand
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
sir
.
<EOS>
You
are
free
to
go
,
and
we
to
follow
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
warn
you
,
by
all
I
hold
most
solemn
and
most
sacred
,
that
instant
will
have
you
apprehended
on
a
charge
of
fraud
and
robbery
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
resolute
and
immoveable
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
are
determined
to
be
the
same
,
your
blood
be
upon
your
own
head
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
what
authority
am
I
kidnapped
in
the
street
,
and
brought
here
by
these
dogs
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Monks
,
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
men
who
stood
beside
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
mine
,
"
replied
Mr
Brownlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
Those
persons
are
indemnified
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
complain
of
being
deprived
of
your
liberty
---
you
had
power
and
opportunity
to
retrieve
it
as
you
came
along
,
but
you
deemed
it
advisable
to
remain
quiet
---
<EOS>
I
say
again
,
throw
yourself
for
protection
on
the
law
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
appeal
to
the
law
too
;
but
when
you
have
gone
too
far
to
recede
,
do
not
sue
to
me
for
leniency
,
when
the
power
will
have
passed
into
other
hands
;
and
do
not
say
I
plunged
you
down
the
gulf
into
which
you
rushed
,
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
Monks
was
plainly
disconcerted
,
and
alarmed
besides
.
 
<EOS>
He
hesitated
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
decide
quickly
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
with
perfect
firmness
and
composure
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
wish
me
to
prefer
my
charges
publicly
,
and
consign
you
to
a
punishment
the
extent
of
which
,
although
I
can
,
with
a
shudder
,
foresee
,
I
can
not
control
,
once
more
,
I
say
,
for
you
know
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
If
not
,
and
you
appeal
to
my
forbearance
,
and
the
mercy
of
those
you
have
deeply
injured
,
seat
yourself
,
without
a
word
,
in
that
chair
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
waited
for
you
two
whole
days
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Monks
muttered
some
unintelligible
words
,
but
wavered
still
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
prompt
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
word
from
me
,
and
the
alternative
has
gone
for
ever
.
"
   
<EOS>
Still
the
man
hesitated
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
inclination
to
parley
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
"
and
,
<EOS>
as
I
advocate
the
dearest
interests
of
others
,
I
have
not
the
right
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
---
"
demanded
Monks
with
a
faltering
tongue
,
---
"
is
there
---
no
middle
course
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
None
.
"
   
<EOS>
Monks
looked
at
the
old
gentleman
,
with
an
anxious
eye
;
but
,
reading
in
his
countenance
nothing
but
severity
and
determination
,
walked
into
the
room
,
and
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
sat
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lock
the
door
on
the
outside
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
to
the
attendants
,
"
and
come
when
I
ring
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
men
obeyed
,
and
the
two
were
left
alone
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
pretty
treatment
,
sir
,
"
said
Monks
,
throwing
down
his
hat
and
cloak
,
"
from
my
father
's
oldest
friend
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
because
I
was
your
father
's
oldest
friend
,
young
man
,
"
returned
Mr
Brownlow
;
"
it
is
because
the
hopes
and
wishes
of
young
and
happy
years
were
bound
up
with
him
,
and
that
fair
creature
of
his
blood
and
kindred
who
rejoined
her
God
in
youth
,
and
left
me
here
a
solitary
,
lonely
man
:
 
<EOS>
it
is
because
he
knelt
with
me
beside
his
only
sisters
'
death
-
bed
when
he
was
yet
a
boy
,
on
the
morning
that
would
---
but
Heaven
willed
otherwise
---
have
made
her
my
young
wife
;
it
is
because
my
seared
heart
clung
to
him
,
from
that
time
forth
,
through
all
his
trials
and
errors
,
till
he
died
;
it
is
because
old
recollections
and
associations
filled
my
heart
,
and
even
the
sight
of
you
brings
with
it
old
thoughts
of
him
;
it
is
because
of
all
these
things
that
I
am
moved
to
treat
you
gently
now
---
yes
,
Edward
Leeford
,
even
now
---
and
blush
for
your
unworthiness
who
bear
the
name
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
has
the
name
to
do
with
it
?
"
asked
the
other
,
after
contemplating
,
half
in
silence
,
and
half
in
dogged
wonder
,
the
agitation
of
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
name
to
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
replied
Mr
Brownlow
,
"
nothing
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
HERS
,
and
even
at
this
distance
of
time
brings
back
to
me
,
an
old
man
,
the
glow
and
thrill
which
I
once
felt
,
only
to
hear
it
repeated
by
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
glad
you
have
changed
it
---
<EOS>
very
---
very
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
all
mighty
fine
,
"
said
Monks
(
to
retain
his
assumed
designation
)
after
a
long
silence
,
during
which
he
had
jerked
himself
in
sullen
defiance
to
and
fro
,
and
Mr
Brownlow
had
sat
,
shading
his
face
with
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
But
what
do
you
want
with
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
brother
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
rousing
himself
:
 
"
a
brother
,
the
whisper
of
whose
name
in
your
ear
when
I
came
behind
you
in
the
street
,
was
,
in
itself
,
almost
enough
to
make
you
accompany
me
hither
,
in
wonder
and
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
brother
,
"
replied
Monks
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
was
an
only
child
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
you
talk
to
me
of
brothers
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
,
as
well
as
I.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Attend
to
what
I
do
know
,
and
you
may
not
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
interest
you
by
and
by
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
of
the
wretched
marriage
,
into
which
family
pride
,
and
the
most
sordid
and
narrowest
of
all
ambition
,
forced
your
unhappy
father
when
a
mere
boy
,
you
were
the
sole
and
most
unnatural
issue
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
for
hard
names
,
"
interrupted
Monks
with
a
jeering
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
the
fact
,
and
that
's
enough
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
also
know
,
"
pursued
the
old
gentleman
,
"
the
misery
,
the
slow
torture
,
the
protracted
anguish
of
that
ill
-
assorted
union
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
listlessly
and
wearily
each
of
that
wretched
pair
dragged
on
their
heavy
chain
through
a
world
that
was
poisoned
to
them
both
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
how
cold
formalities
were
succeeded
by
open
taunts
;
how
indifference
gave
place
to
dislike
,
dislike
to
hate
,
and
hate
to
loathing
,
until
at
last
they
wrenched
the
clanking
bond
asunder
,
and
retiring
a
wide
space
apart
,
carried
each
a
galling
fragment
,
of
which
nothing
but
death
could
break
the
rivets
,
to
hide
it
in
new
society
beneath
the
gayest
looks
they
could
assume
.
 
<EOS>
Your
mother
succeeded
;
she
forgot
it
soon
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
rusted
and
cankered
at
your
father
's
heart
for
years
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
they
were
separated
,
"
said
Monks
,
"
and
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
they
had
been
separated
for
some
time
,
"
returned
Mr
Brownlow
,
"
and
your
mother
,
wholly
given
up
to
continental
frivolities
,
had
utterly
forgotten
the
young
husband
<EOS>
ten
good
years
her
junior
,
who
,
with
prospects
blighted
,
lingered
on
at
home
,
he
fell
among
new
friends
.
 
<EOS>
This
circumstance
,
at
least
,
you
know
already
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
I
,
"
said
Monks
,
turning
away
his
eyes
and
beating
his
foot
upon
the
ground
,
as
a
man
who
is
determined
to
deny
everything
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
I.
"
   
"
Your
manner
,
no
less
than
your
actions
,
assures
me
that
you
have
never
forgotten
it
,
or
ceased
to
think
of
it
with
bitterness
,
"
returned
Mr
Brownlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
speak
of
fifteen
years
ago
,
when
you
were
not
more
than
eleven
years
old
,
and
your
father
but
one
-
and
-
thirty
---
for
he
was
<EOS>
,
I
repeat
,
<EOS>
a
boy
,
when
HIS
father
ordered
him
to
marry
.
<EOS>
Must
I
go
back
to
events
which
cast
a
shade
upon
the
memory
of
your
parent
,
or
will
you
spare
it
,
and
disclose
to
me
the
truth
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
disclose
,
"
rejoined
Monks
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
talk
on
if
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
These
new
friends
,
then
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
"
were
a
naval
officer
retired
from
active
service
,
whose
wife
had
died
some
half
-
a
-
year
before
,
and
left
him
with
two
children
---
there
had
been
more
,
but
,
of
all
their
family
,
happily
but
two
survived
.
<EOS>
They
were
both
daughters
;
one
a
beautiful
creature
of
nineteen
,
and
the
other
a
mere
child
of
two
or
three
years
old
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
this
to
me
?
"
asked
Monks
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
resided
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
without
seeming
to
hear
the
interruption
,
"
in
a
part
of
the
country
to
which
your
father
in
his
wandering
had
repaired
,
and
where
he
had
taken
up
his
abode
.
<EOS>
Acquaintance
,
intimacy
,
friendship
,
fast
followed
on
each
other
.
<EOS>
Your
father
was
gifted
as
few
men
are
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
his
sister
's
soul
and
person
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
old
officer
knew
him
more
and
more
,
he
grew
to
love
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
that
it
had
ended
there
.
 
<EOS>
His
daughter
did
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
paused
;
Monks
was
biting
his
lips
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
floor
;
seeing
this
,
he
immediately
resumed
:
   
<EOS>
"
The
end
of
a
year
found
him
contracted
,
solemnly
contracted
,
to
that
daughter
;
the
object
of
the
first
,
true
,
ardent
,
only
passion
of
a
guileless
girl
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
tale
is
of
the
longest
,
"
observed
Monks
,
moving
restlessly
in
his
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
true
tale
of
grief
and
trial
,
and
sorrow
,
young
man
,
"
returned
Mr
Brownlow
,
"
and
such
tales
usually
are
;
if
it
were
one
of
unmixed
joy
and
happiness
,
it
would
be
very
brief
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
one
of
those
rich
relations
to
strengthen
whose
interest
and
importance
your
father
had
been
sacrificed
,
as
others
are
often
---
it
is
no
uncommon
case
---
died
,
and
to
repair
the
misery
he
had
been
instrumental
in
occasioning
,
left
him
his
panacea
for
all
griefs
---
Money
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
necessary
that
he
should
immediately
repair
to
Rome
,
whither
this
man
had
sped
for
health
,
and
where
he
had
died
,
leaving
his
affairs
in
great
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
;
was
seized
with
mortal
illness
there
;
was
followed
,
the
moment
the
intelligence
reached
Paris
,
by
your
mother
who
carried
you
with
her
;
he
died
the
day
after
her
arrival
,
leaving
no
will
---
NO
WILL
---
so
that
the
whole
property
fell
to
her
and
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
part
of
the
recital
Monks
held
his
breath
,
and
listened
with
a
face
of
intense
eagerness
,
though
his
eyes
were
not
directed
towards
the
speaker
.
 
<EOS>
As
Mr
Brownlow
paused
,
he
changed
his
position
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
experienced
a
sudden
relief
,
and
wiped
his
hot
face
and
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
Before
he
went
abroad
,
and
as
he
passed
through
London
on
his
way
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
slowly
,
and
fixing
his
eyes
upon
the
other
's
face
,
"
he
came
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
of
that
,
"
interrupted
MOnks
in
a
tone
intended
to
appear
incredulous
,
but
savouring
more
of
disagreeable
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
came
to
me
,
and
left
with
me
,
among
some
other
things
,
a
picture
---
a
portrait
painted
by
himself
---
a
likeness
of
this
poor
girl
---
which
he
did
not
wish
to
leave
behind
,
and
could
not
carry
forward
on
his
hasty
journey
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
worn
by
anxiety
and
remorse
almost
to
a
shadow
;
talked
in
a
wild
,
distracted
way
,
of
ruin
and
dishonour
worked
by
himself
;
confided
to
me
his
intention
to
convert
his
whole
property
,
at
any
loss
,
into
money
,
and
,
having
settled
on
his
wife
and
you
a
portion
of
his
recent
acquisition
,
to
fly
the
country
---
I
guessed
too
well
<EOS>
he
would
not
fly
alone
---
and
never
see
it
more
.
 
<EOS>
Even
from
me
,
his
old
and
early
friend
,
whose
strong
attachment
had
taken
root
in
the
earth
that
covered
one
most
dear
to
both
---
even
from
me
he
withheld
any
more
particular
confession
,
promising
to
write
and
tell
me
all
,
and
after
that
to
see
me
once
again
,
for
the
last
time
on
earth
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
 
<EOS>
THAT
was
the
last
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
letter
,
and
I
never
saw
him
more
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
went
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
after
a
short
pause
,
"
I
went
,
when
all
was
over
,
to
the
scene
of
his

<EOS>
I
will
use
the
term
the
world
would
freely
use
,
for
worldly
harshness
or
favour
are
now
alike
to
him
---
of
his
guilty
love
,
resolved
that
if
my
fears
were
realised
that
erring
child
should
find
one
heart
and
home
to
shelter
and
compassionate
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
family
had
left
that
part
a
week
before
;
they
had
called
in
such
trifling
debts
as
were
outstanding
,
discharged
them
,
and
left
the
place
by
night
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
or
whithter
,
none
can
tell
.
"
   
<EOS>
Monks
drew
his
breath
yet
more
freely
,
and
looked
round
with
a
smile
of
triumph
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
your
brother
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
drawing
nearer
to
the
other
's
chair
,
"
<EOS>
When
your
brother
:
 
a
feeble
,
ragged
,
neglected
child
:
 
was
cast
in
my
way
by
a
stronger
hand
than
chance
,
and
rescued
by
me
from
a
life
of
vice
and
infamy
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
What
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Monks
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
me
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
I
should
interest
you
before
long
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
by
me
---
<EOS>
I
see
that
your
cunning
associate
suppressed
my
name
,
although
for
ought
he
knew
,
it
would
be
quite
strange
to
your
ears
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
rescued
by
me
,
then
,
and
lay
recovering
from
sickness
in
my
house
,
his
strong
resemblance
to
this
picture
I
have
spoken
of
,
struck
me
with
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
I
first
saw
him
in
all
his
dirt
and
misery
,
there
was
a
lingering
expression
in
his
face
that
came
upon
me
like
a
glimpse
of
some
old
friend
flashing
on
one
in
a
vivid
dream
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
he
was
snared
away
before
I
knew
his
history
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Why
not
?
"
asked
Monks
hastily
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Because
you
know
it
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Denial
to
me
is
vain
,
"
replied
Mr
Brownlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
show
you
that
I
know
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
---
you
---
ca
n't
prove
anything
against
me
,
"
stammered
Monks
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
defy
you
to
do
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
,
"
returned
the
old
gentleman
with
a
searching
glance
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
lost
the
boy
,
and
no
efforts
of
mine
could
recover
him
.
 
<EOS>
Your
mother
being
dead
,
I
knew
that
you
alone
could
solve
the
mystery
if
anybody
could
,
and
as
when
I
had
last
heard
of
you
you
were
on
your
own
estate
in
the
West
Indies
---
whither
,
<EOS>
as
you
well
know
,
you
retired
upon
your
mother
's
death
to
escape
the
consequences
of
vicious
courses
here
---
I
made
the
voyage
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
left
it
,
months
before
,
and
were
supposed
to
be
in
London
,
but
no
one
could
tell
where
.
 
<EOS>
I
returned
.
 
<EOS>
Your
agents
had
no
clue
to
your
residence
.
 
<EOS>
You
came
and
went
,
they
said
,
as
strangely
as
you
had
ever
done
:
 
sometimes
for
days
together
and
sometimes
not
for
months
:
 
<EOS>
keeping
to
all
appearance
the
same
low
haunts
and
mingling
with
the
same
infamous
herd
who
had
been
your
associates
when
a
fierce
ungovernable
boy
.
 
<EOS>
I
wearied
them
with
new
applications
.
 
<EOS>
I
paced
the
streets
by
night
and
day
,
but
until
two
hours
ago
,
all
my
efforts
were
fruitless
,
and
I
never
saw
you
for
an
instant
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
now
you
do
see
me
,
"
said
Monks
,
rising
boldly
,
"
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
Fraud
and
robbery
are
high
-
sounding
words
---
<EOS>
justified
,
you
think
,
by
a
fancied
resemblance
in
some
young
imp
to
an
idle
daub
of
a
dead
man
's
Brother
!
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
even
know
that
a
child
was
born
of
this
maudlin
pair
;
you
do
n't
even
know
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
DID
NOT
,
"
replied
Mr
Brownlow
,
rising
too
;
"
but
within
the
last
fortnight
I
have
learnt
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
a
brother
;
you
know
it
,
and
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
will
,
which
your
mother
destroyed
,
leaving
the
secret
and
the
gain
to
you
at
her
own
death
.
 
<EOS>
It
contained
a
reference
to
some
child
likely
to
be
the
result
of
this
sad
connection
,
which
child
was
born
,
and
accidentally
encountered
by
you
,
when
your
suspicions
were
first
awakened
by
his
resemblance
to
your
father
.
 
<EOS>
You
repaired
to
the
place
of
his
birth
.
<EOS>
There
existed
proofs
---
proofs
long
suppressed
---
of
his
birth
and
parentage
.
 
<EOS>
Those
proofs
were
destroyed
by
you
,
and
now
,
in
your
own
words
to
your
accomplice
the
Jew
,
"
THE
ONLY
PROOFS
OF

<EOS>
Unworthy
son

coward

liar
,
---
you
,
who
hold
your
councils
with
thieves
and
murderers
in
dark
rooms
at
night
,

you
,
whose
plots

wiles
have
brought
a
violent
death
upon
the
head
of
one
worth
millions
such
as
you

you
,
who
from
your
cradle
were
gall

bitterness
to
your
own
father
's
heart
,
and
in
whom
all
evil
passions
,
vice
,
and
profligacy
,
festered
,
till
they
found
a
vent
in
a
hideous
disease
which
had
made
your
face
an
index
even
to
your
mind

do
you
still
brave

<EOS>
"
No

no

no

returned
the
coward
,
overwhelmed
by
these
accumulated
charges
.
   
<EOS>
"
Every

cried
the
gentleman
,
"
every
word
that
has
passed
between
you

this
detested
villain

<EOS>
Shadows
on
the
wall
have
caught
your
whispers
,
and
brought
them
to
my
ear
;
the
sight
of
the
persecuted
child
has
turned
vice
itself
,
and
given
it
the
courage

almost
the
attributes
of
virtue

Murder
has
been
done

which
you

a

No

no

interposed
Monks
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
knew
nothing
of
that

I
was
going
to
inquire
the
truth
of
the
story
when
you
overtook
me

<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
the
cause

<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
a
common
quarrel

It
was
the
partial
disclosure

replied
Mr

Will
you
disclose
the
whole
?

Yes

<EOS>
"
Remain
quietly

drawn
up

proceed
with

I

deem
most
advisable

attesting
it

<EOS>
"
If
you
insist
upon
that
,
I
'll
do
that
also

replied
Monks

<EOS>
"
You
must
do
more
than
that

said
Mr
Brownlow

<EOS>
"
Make
restitution

an
innocent

unoffending
child

he
is

the
offspring

guilty
and
most
miserable
love

You
have
not

the
provisions

the
will

Carry
them
into
execution
so
far

While
Monks
was
pacing
up
and
down
,
meditating
with
dark
and
evil
looks
on
this
proposal
and
the
possibilities
of
evading
it
:
 
<EOS>
torn
by
his
fears
on
the
one
hand
and
his
hatred
on
the
other
:
 
<EOS>
the
door
was
hurriedly
unlocked
,
and
a
gentleman
(
Mr
Losberne
)
entered
the
room
in
violent
agitation
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
man
will
be
taken

he
cried
.

"
He
will
be
taken

The
murderer

asked
Mr

<EOS>
Yes

yes

replied
the
other

His

I
will
give
fifty
more

said
Mr

Mr

Harry

As
soon

safe
in

coach

you

he
hurried
off
to
where
he
heard
this

replied
the
doctor
,
"
and
mounting
his
horse
sallied
forth
to
join
the
first
party
at
some
place
in
the
outskirts
agreed
upon
between
them

Fagin

said
Mr

what

When

last
heard

he

They

him

Have
you
made
up

asked
Mr

in

low
voice

of
Monks

Yes

he
replied

"
You

I

Remain

They
left
the
room
,

the
door
was
again
locked

"
What
have
you
done

"
asked
the
doctor
in
a
whisper

All
that
I
could
hope
to
do

even
more

Coupling
the
poor

's
intelligence
with
my
previous
knowledge
,
and
the
result
of
our
good
friend
's
inquiries
on
the
spot
,
I
left
him
no
loophole
of
escape
,
and
laid
bare
the
whole
villainy
which
by
these
lights
became
plain
as
day

Write

appoint
the
evening
after

at
seven

for
the
meeting

We
shall
be
down

a

shall
require
rest

the
young

who
MAY

greater
need
of
firmness

either
you

quite
foresee
just

But
my

Drive

The
pursuit

escape

<EOS>
Near
to
that
part
of
the
Thames
on
which
the
church
at
Rotherhithe
abuts
,
where
the
buildings
on
the
banks
are
dirtiest
and
the
vessels
on
the
river
blackest
with
the
dust
of
colliers
and
the
smoke
of
close
-
built
low
-
roofed
houses
,
there
exists
the
filthiest
,
the
strangest
,
the
most
extraordinary
of
the
many
localities
that
are
hidden
in
London
,
wholly
unknown
,
even
by
name
,
to
the
great
mass
of
its
inhabitants
.
   
<EOS>
To
reach
this
place
,
the
visitor
has
to
penetrate
through
a
maze
of
close
,
narrow
,
and
muddy
streets
,
thronged
by
the
rougest
and
poorest
of
waterside
people
,
and
devoted
to
the
traffic
they
may
be
supposed
to
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
The
cheapest
and
<EOS>
least
delicate
provisions
are
heaped
in
the
shops
;
the
coarsest
and
commonest
articles
of
wearing
apparel
dangle
at
the
salesman
's
door
,
and
stream
from
the
house
-
parapet
and
windows
.
 
<EOS>
Jostling
with
unemployed
labourers
of
the
lowest
class
,
ballast
-
heavers
,
coal
-
whippers
,
brazen
women
,
ragged
children
,
and
the
raff
and
refuse
of
the
river
,
he
makes
his
way
with
difficulty
along
,
assailed
by
offensive
sights
and
smells
from
the
narrow
alleys
which
branch
off
on
the
right
and
left
,
and
deafened
by
the
clash
of
ponderous
waggons
that
bear
great
piles
of
merchandise
from
the
stacks
of
warehouses
that
rise
from
every
corner
.
 
<EOS>
Arriving
,
at
length
,
in
streets
remoter
and
less
-
frequented
than
those
through
which
he
has
passed
,
he
walks
beneath
tottering
house
-
fronts
projecting
over
the
pavement
,
dismantled
walls
that
seem
to
totter
as
he
passes
,
<EOS>
chimneys
half
crushed
half
<EOS>
hesitating
to
fall
,
windows
guarded
by
rusty
iron
bars
that
time
and
dirt
have
almost
eaten
away
,
every
imaginable
sign
of
desolation
and
neglect
.
   
<EOS>
In
such
a
neighborhood
,
beyond
Dockhead
in
the
Borough
of
Southwark
,
stands
Jacob
's
Island
,
surrounded
by
a
muddy
ditch
,
six
or
eight
feet
deep
and
fifteen
or
twenty
wide
when
the
tide
is
in
,
once
called
Mill
Pond
,
but
known
in
the
days
of
this
story
as
Folly
Ditch
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
creek
or
inlet
from
the
Thames
,
and
can
always
be
filled
at
high
water
by
opening
the
sluices
at
the
Lead
Mills
from
which
it
took
its
old
name
.
 
<EOS>
At
such
times
,
a
stranger
,
looking
from
one
of
the
wooden
bridges
thrown
across
it
at
Mill
Lane
,
will
see
the
inhabitants
of
the
houses
on
either
side
lowering
from
their
back
doors
and
windows
,
buckets
,
pails
,
domestic
utensils
of
all
kinds
,
in
which
to
haul
the
water
up
;
and
when
his
eye
is
turned
from
these
operations
to
the
houses
themselves
,
his
utmost
astonishment
will
be
excited
by
the
scene
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
Crazy
wooden
galleries
common
to
the
backs
of
half
a
dozen
houses
,
with
holes
from
which
to
look
upon
the
slime
beneath
;
windows
,
broken
and
patched
,
with
poles
thrust
out
,
on
which
to
dry
the
linen
that
is
never
there
;
rooms
so
small
,
so
filthy
,
so
confined
,
that
the
air
would
seem
too
tainted
even
for
the
dirt
and
squalor
which
they
shelter
;
<EOS>
wooden
chambers
thrusting
themselves
out
above
the
mud
,
and
threatening
to
fall
into
it
---
as
some
have
done
;
dirt
-
besmeared
walls
and
decaying
foundations
;
every
repulsive
lineament
of
poverty
,
every
loathsome
indication
of
filth
,
rot
,
and
garbage
;
all
these
ornament
the
banks
of
Folly
Ditch
.

are
roofless
and
empty
;
the
walls
are
crumbling
down
;
the
windows
are
windows
no
more
;
the
doors
are
falling
into

blackened

Thirty
or
forty
years
ago
,
before
losses
and
chancery
suits
came
upon
it
,
it
was
a
thriving
place
;
but
now
it
is
a
desolate
island
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
The
houses
have
no
owners
;
they
are
broken
open
,
and
entered
upon
by
those
who
have
the
courage
;
and
there
they
live
,
and
there
they
die
.
 
<EOS>
They
must
have
powerful
motives
for
a
secret
residence
,
or
be
reduced
to
a
destitute
condition
indeed
,
who
seek
a
refuge
in
Jacob
's
Island
.
   
<EOS>
In
an
upper
room
of
one
of
these
houses
---
a
detached
house
of
fair
size
,
ruinous
in
other
respects
,
but
strongly
defended
at
door
and
window
:
 
of
which
house
the
back
commanded
the
ditch
in
manner
already
described
---
there
were
assembled
three
men
,
who
,
regarding
each
other
every
now
and
then
with
looks
expressive
of
perplexity
and
expectation
,
sat
for
some
time
in
profound
and
gloomy
silence
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
these
was
Toby
Crackit
,
another
Mr
Chitling
,
and
the
third
a
robber
of
fifty
years
,
whose
nose
had
been
almost
beaten
in
,
in
some
old
scuffle
,
and
whose
face
bore
a
frightful
scar
which
might
probably
be
traced
to
the
same
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
This
man
was
a
returned
transport
,
and
his
name
was
Kags
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
"
said
Toby
turning
to
Mr
Chitling
,
"
<EOS>
that
you
had
picked
out
some
other
crig
when
the
two
old
ones
got
too
warm
,
and
had
not
come
here
,
my
fine
feller
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
you
,
blunder
-
head
!
"
said
Kags
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
thought
you
'd
have
been
a
little
more
glad
to
see
me
than
this
,
"
replied
Mr
Chitling
,
with
a
melancholy
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
look'e
,
young
gentleman
,
"
said
Toby
,
"
when
a
man
keeps
himself
so
very
ex
-
clusive
as
I
have
done
,
and
by
that
means
has
a
snug
house
over
his
head
with
nobody
a
prying
and
smelling
about
it
,
it
's
rather
a
startling
thing
to
have
the
honour
of
a
wisit
from
a
young
gentleman
(
however
respectable
and
pleasant
a
person
he
may
be
to
play
cards
with
at
conweniency
)
<EOS>
circumstanced
as
you
are
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Especially
,
when
the
exclusive
young
man
has
got
a
friend
stopping
with
him
,
that
's
arrived
sooner
than
was
expected
from
foreign
parts
,
and
is
too
modest
to
want
to
be
presented
to
the
Judges
on
his
return
,
"
added
Mr
Kags
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
short
silence
,
after
which
Toby
Crackit
,
seeming
to
abandon
as
hopeless
any
further
effort
to
maintain
his
usual
devil
-
may
-
care
swagger
,
turned
to
Chitling
and
said
,
   
"
<EOS>
When
was
Fagin
took
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
at
dinner
-
time
---
two
o'clock
this
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
Charley
<EOS>
and
I
made
our
lucky
up
the
wash
-
us
chimney
,
and
Bolter
got
into
the
empty
water
-
butt
,
head
downwards
;
but
his
legs
were
so
precious
long
that
they
stuck
out
at
the
top
,
and
so
they
took
him
too
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
Bet
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
Bet
!
 
<EOS>
She
went
to
see
the
Body
,
to
speak
to
who
it
was
,
"
replied
Chitling
,
his
countenance
falling
more
and
more
,
"
and
went
off
mad
,
screaming
and
raving
,
and
beating
her
head
against
the
boards
;
so
they
put
a
strait
-
weskut
on
her
and
took
her
to
the
hospital
---
<EOS>
and
there
she
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
's
come
of
young
Bates
?
"
demanded
Kags
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
hung
about
,
not
to
come
over
here
afore
dark
,
but
he
'll
be
here
soon
,
"
replied
Chitling
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
nowhere
else
to
go
to
now
,
for
the
people
at
the
Cripples
are
all
in
custody
,
and
the
bar
of
the
ken
---
I
went
up
there
and
see
it
with
my
own
eyes
---
is
filled
with
traps
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
smash
,
"
observed
Toby
,
biting
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
more
than
one
will
go
with
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
sessions
are
on
,
"
said
Kags
:
 
<EOS>
"
if
they
get
the
inquest
over
,
and
Bolter
turns
King
's
evidence
:
 
as
of
course
he
will
,
from
what
he
's
said
already
:
 
they
can
prove
Fagin
an
accessory
before
the
fact
,
and
get
the
trial
on
on
Friday
,
and
he
'll
swing
in
six
days
from
this
,
by
G
---
 
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
heard
the
people
groan
,
"
said
Chitling
;
<EOS>
"
the
officers
fought
like
devils
,
or
they
'd
have
torn
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
down
once
,
but
they
made
a
ring
round
him
,
and
fought
their
way
along
.
 
<EOS>
You
should
have
seen
how
he
looked
about
him
,
all
muddy
and
bleeding
,
and
clung
to
them
as
if
they
were
his
dearest
friends
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
see
'em
now
,
not
able
to
stand
upright
with
the
pressing
of
the
mob
,
and
draggin
him
along
amongst
'em
;
I
can
see
the
people
jumping
up
,
one
behind
another
,
and
snarling
with
their
teeth
and
making
at
him
;
I
can
see
the
blood
upon
his
hair
and
beard
,
and
hear
the
cries
with
which
the
women
worked
themselves
into
the
centre
of
the
crowd
at
the
street
corner
,
and
swore
they
'd
tear
his
heart
out
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
horror
-
stricken
witness
of
this
scene
pressed
his
hands
upon
his
ears
,
and
with
his
eyes
closed
got
up
and
paced
violently
to
and
fro
,
like
one
distracted
.
   
<EOS>
While
he
was
thus
engaged
,
and
the
two
men
sat
by
in
silence
with
their
eyes
fixed
upon
the
floor
,
a
pattering
noise
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
,
and
Sikes
's
dog
bounded
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
They
ran
to
the
window
,
downstairs
,
and
into
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
The
dog
had
jumped
in
at
an
open
window
;
he
made
no
attempt
to
follow
them
,
nor
was
his
master
to
be
seen
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
meaning
of
this
?
"
said
Toby
when
they
had
returned
.
<EOS>
"
He
ca
n't
be
coming
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
---
<EOS>
I
---
hope
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
he
was
coming
here
,
he
'd
have
come
with
the
dog
,
"
said
Kags
,
stooping
down
to
examine
the
animal
,
who
lay
panting
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
!
 
<EOS>
Give
us
some
water
for
him
;
he
has
run
himself
faint
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
drunk
it
all
up
,
every
drop
,
"
said
Chitling
after
watching
the
dog
some
time
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Covered
with
mud
---
lame
---
half
blind
---
he
must
have
come
a
long
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
can
he
have
come
from
!
"
exclaimed
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
been
to
the
other
kens
of
course
,
and
finding
them
filled
with
strangers
come
on
here
,
where
he
's
been
many
a
time
and
often
.
 
<EOS>
But
where
can
he
have
come
from
first
,
and
how
comes
he
here
alone
without
the
other
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
"
---
(
none
of
them
called
the
murderer
by
his
old
name
)
---
"
He
ca
n't
have
made
away
with
himself
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
?
"
said
Chitling
.
   
<EOS>
Toby
shook
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
he
had
,
"
said
Kags
,
"
the
dog
'
ud
want
to
lead
us
away
to
where
he
did
it
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
's
got
out
of
the
country
,
and
left
the
dog
behind
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
have
given
him
the
slip
somehow
,
or
he
would
n't
be
so
easy
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
solution
,
appearing
the
most
probable
one
,
was
adopted
as
the
right
;
the
dog
,
creeping
under
a
chair
,
coiled
himself
up
to
sleep
,
without
more
notice
from
anybody
.
   
<EOS>
It
being
now
dark
,
the
shutter
was
closed
,
and
a
candle
lighted
and
placed
upon
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
The
terrible
events
of
the
last
two
days
had
made
a
deep
impression
on
all
three
,
increased
by
the
danger
and
uncertainty
of
their
own
position
.
 
<EOS>
They
drew
their
chairs
closer
together
,
starting
at
every
sound
.
 
<EOS>
They
spoke
little
,
and
that
in
whispers
,
and
were
as
silent
and
awe
-
stricken
as
if
the
remains
of
the
murdered
woman
lay
in
the
next
room
.
   
<EOS>
They
had
sat
thus
,
some
time
,
when
suddenly
was
heard
a
hurried
knocking
at
the
door
below
.
   
<EOS>
"
Young
Bates
,
"
said
Kags
,
looking
angrily
round
,
to
check
the
fear
he
felt
himself
.
   
<EOS>
The
knocking
came
again
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
it
was
n't
he
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
knocked
like
that
.
   
<EOS>
Crackit
went
to
the
window
,
and
shaking
all
over
,
drew
in
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
need
to
tell
them
who
it
was
;
his
pale
face
was
enough
.
 
<EOS>
The
dog
too
was
on
the
alert
in
an
instant
,
and
ran
whining
to
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
must
let
him
in
,
"
he
said
,
taking
up
the
candle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
there
any
help
for
it
?
"
asked
the
other
man
in
a
hoarse
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
None
.
 
<EOS>
He
MUST
come
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
leave
us
in
the
dark
,
"
said
Kags
,
taking
down
a
candle
from
the
chimney
-
piece
,
and
lighting
it
,
with
such
a
trembling
hand
that
the
knocking
was
twice
repeated
before
he
had
finished
.
   
<EOS>
Crackit
went
down
to
the
door
,
and
returned
followed
by
a
man
with
the
lower
part
of
his
face
buried
in
a
handkerchief
,
and
another
tied
over
his
head
under
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
He
drew
them
slowly
off
.
 
<EOS>
Blanched
face
,
sunken
eyes
,
hollow
cheeks
,
beard
of
three
days
'
growth
,
wasted
flesh
,
short
thick
breath
;
it
was
the
very
ghost
of
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
He
laid
his
hand
upon
a
chair
which
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
but
shuddering
as
he
was
about
to
drop
into
it
,
and
seeming
to
glance
over
his
shoulder
,
dragged
it
back
close
to
the
wall
---
as
close
as
it
would
go
---
and
ground
it
against
it
---
and
sat
down
.
   
<EOS>
Not
a
word
had
been
exchanged
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
from
one
to
another
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
If
an
eye
were
furtively
raised
and
met
his
,
it
was
instantly
averted
.
 
<EOS>
When
his
hollow
voice
broke
silence
,
they
all
three
started
.
 
<EOS>
They
seemed
never
to
have
heard
its
tones
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
came
that
dog
here
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alone
.
 
<EOS>
Three
hours
ago
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
-
night
's
paper
says
that
Fagin
's
took
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
true
,
or
a
lie
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
True
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
were
silent
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Damn
you
all
!
"
said
Sikes
,
passing
his
hand
across
his
forehead
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
an
uneasy
movement
among
them
,
but
nobody
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
that
keep
this
house
,
"
said
Sikes
,
turning
his
face
to
Crackit
,
"
do
you
mean
to
sell
me
,
or
to
let
me
lie
here
till
this
hunt
is
over
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
stop
here
,
if
you
think
it
safe
,
"
returned
the
person
addressed
,
after
some
hesitation
.
   
<EOS>
Sikes
carried
his
eyes
slowly
up
the
wall
behind
him
:
 
rather
trying
to
turn
his
head
than
actually
doing
it
:
 
and
said
,
"
Is
---
it
---
the
body
---
<EOS>
is
it
buried
?
"
   
<EOS>
They
shook
their
heads
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
is
n't
it
!
"
<EOS>
he
retorted
with
the
same
glance
behind
him
.
"
<EOS>
Wot
do
they
keep
such
ugly
things
above
the
ground
for
?
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Who
's
that
knocking
?
"
   
<EOS>
Crackit
intimated
,
by
a
motion
of
his
hand
as
he
left
the
room
,
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
;
and
directly
came
back
with
Charley
Bates
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
Sikes
sat
opposite
the
door
,
so
that
the
moment
the
boy
entered
the
room
he
encountered
his
figure
.
   
<EOS>
"
Toby
,
"
said
the
boy
falling
back
,
as
Sikes
turned
his
eyes
towards
him
,
"
why
did
n't
you
tell
me
this
,
downstairs
?
"
   
<EOS>
There
had
been
something
so
tremendous
in
the
shrinking
off
of
the
three
,
that
the
wretched
man
was
willing
to
propitiate
even
this
lad
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
he
nodded
,
and
made
as
though
he
would
shake
hands
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
into
some
other
room
,
"
said
the
boy
,
retreating
still
farther
.
   
<EOS>
"
Charley
!
"
said
Sikes
,
stepping
forward
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
---
do
n't
you
know
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
come
nearer
me
,
"
answered
the
boy
,
still
retreating
,
and
looking
,
with
horror
in
his
eyes
,
upon
the
murderer
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
monster
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
man
stopped
half
-
way
,
and
they
looked
at
each
other
;
but
Sikes
's
eyes
sunk
gradually
to
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
Witness
you
three
,
"
cried
the
boy
shaking
his
clenched
fist
,
and
becoming
more
and
more
excited
as
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
"
Witness
you
three
---
I
'm
not
afraid
of
him
---
if
they
come
here
after
him
,
I
'll
give
him
up
;
I
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
out
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
kill
me
for
it
if
he
likes
,
or
if
he
dares
,
but
if
I
am
here
I
'll
give
him
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
give
him
up
if
he
was
to
be
boiled
alive
.
 
<EOS>
Murder
!
<EOS>
Help
!
 
<EOS>
If
there
's
the
pluck
of
a
man
among
you
three
,
you
'll
help
me
.
 
<EOS>
Murder
!
 
<EOS>
Help
!
 
<EOS>
Down
with
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
Pouring
out
these
cries
,
and
accompanying
them
with
violent
gesticulation
,
the
boy
actually
threw
himself
,
single
-
handed
,
upon
the
strong
man
,
and
in
the
intensity
of
his
energy
and
the
suddenness
of
his
surprise
,
brought
him
heavily
to
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
The
three
spectators
seemed
quite
stupefied
.
 
<EOS>
They
offered
no
interference
,
and
the
boy
and
man
rolled
on
the
ground
together
;
the
former
,
heedless
of
the
blows
that
showered
upon
him
,
wrenching
his
hands
tighter
and
tighter
in
the
garments
about
the
murderer
's
breast
,
and
never
ceasing
to
call
for
help
with
all
his
might
.
   
<EOS>
The
contest
,
however
,
was
too
unequal
to
last
long
.
 
<EOS>
Sikes
had
him
down
,
and
his
knee
was
on
his
throat
,
when
Crackit
pulled
him
back
with
a
look
of
alarm
,
and
pointed
to
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
lights
gleaming
below
,
voices
in
loud
and
earnest
conversation
,
the
tramp
of
hurried
footsteps
---
endless
<EOS>
they
seemed
in
number
---
crossing
the
nearest
wooden
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
One
man
on
horseback
seemed
to
be
among
the
crowd
;
for
there
was
the
noise
of
hoofs
rattling
on
the
uneven
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
The
gleam
of
lights
increased
;
the
footsteps
came
more
thickly
and
noisily
on
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
came
a
loud
knocking
at
the
door
,
and
then
a
hoarse
murmur
from
such
a
multitude
of
angry
voices
as
would
have
made
the
boldest
quail
.
   
<EOS>
"
Help
!
"
shrieked
the
boy
in
a
voice
that
rent
the
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
here
!
 
<EOS>
Break
down
the
door
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
King
's
name
,
"
cried
the
voices
without
;
and
the
hoarse
cry
arose
again
,
but
louder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Break
down
the
door
!
"
screamed
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
they
'll
never
open
it
.
 
<EOS>
Run
straight
to
the
room
where
the
light
is
.
<EOS>
Break
down
the
door
!
"
   
<EOS>
Strokes
,
thick
and
heavy
,
rattled
upon
the
door
and
lower
window
-
shutters
as
he
ceased
to
speak
,
and
a
loud
huzzah
burst
from
the
crowd
;
giving
the
listener
,
for
the
first
time
,
some
adequate
idea
of
its
immense
extent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Open
the
door
of
some
place
where
I
can
lock
this
screeching
Hell
-
babe
,
"
cried
Sikes
fiercely
;
running
to
and
fro
,
and
dragging
the
boy
,
now
,
as
easily
as
if
he
were
an
empty
sack
.
"
<EOS>
That
door
.
 
<EOS>
Quick
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
flung
him
in
,
bolted
it
,
and
turned
the
key
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
the
downstairs
door
fast
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Double
-
locked
and
chained
,
"
replied
Crackit
,
who
,
with
the
other
two
men
,
still
remained
quite
helpless
and
bewildered
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
panels
---
are
they
strong
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lined
with
sheet
-
iron
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
windows
too
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
the
windows
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Damn
you
!
"
cried
the
desperate
ruffian
,
throwing
up
the
sash
and
menacing
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
your
worst
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
cheat
you
yet
!
"
   
<EOS>
Of
all
the
terrific
yells
that
ever
fell
on
mortal
ears
,
none
could
exceed
the
cry
of
the
infuriated
throng
.
 
<EOS>
Some
shouted
to
those
who
were
nearest
to
set
the
house
on
fire
;
others
roared
to
the
officers
to
shoot
him
dead
.
 
<EOS>
Among
them
all
,
none
showed
such
fury
as
the
man
on
horseback
,
who
,
throwing
himself
out
of
the
saddle
,
and
bursting
through
the
crowd
as
if
he
were
parting
water
,
cried
,
beneath
the
window
,
in
a
voice
that
rose
above
all
others
,
"
Twenty
guineas
to
the
man
who
brings
a
ladder
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
nearest
voices
took
up
the
cry
,
and
hundreds
echoed
it
.
 
<EOS>
Some
called
for
ladders
,
some
for
sledge
-
hammers
;
some
ran
with
torches
to
and
fro
as
if
to
seek
them
,
and
still
came
back
and
roared
again
;
some
spent
their
breath
in
impotent
curses
and
execrations
;
some
pressed
forward
with
the
ecstasy
of
madmen
,
and
thus
impeded
the
progress
of
those
below
;
some
among
the
boldest
attempted
to
climb
up
by
the
water
-
spout
and
crevices
in
the
wall
;
and
all
waved
to
and
fro
,
in
the
darkness
beneath
,
like
a
field
of
corn
moved
by
an
angry
wind
:
 
and
joined
from
time
to
time
in
one
loud
furious
roar
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
tide
,
"
cried
the
murderer
,
as
he
staggered
back
into
the
room
,
and
shut
the
faces
out
,
"
the
tide
was
in
as
I
came
up
.
<EOS>
Give
me
a
rope
,
a
long
rope
.
 
<EOS>
They
're
all
in
front
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
drop
into
the
Folly
Ditch
,
and
clear
off
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
a
rope
,
or
I
shall
do
three
more
murders
and
kill
myself
.
   
<EOS>
The
panic
-
stricken
men
pointed
to
where
such
articles
were
kept
;
the
murderer
,
hastily
selecting
the
longest
and
strongest
cord
,
hurried
up
to
the
house
-
top
.
   
<EOS>
All
the
window
in
the
rear
of
the
house
had
been
long
ago
bricked
up
,
except
one
small
trap
in
the
room
where
the
boy
was
locked
,
and
that
was
too
small
even
for
the
passage
of
his
body
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
from
this
aperture
,
he
had
never
ceased
to
call
on
those
without
,
to
guard
the
back
;
and
thus
,
when
the
murderer
emerged
at
last
on
the
house
-
top
by
the
door
in
the
roof
,
a
loud
shout
proclaimed
the
fact
to
those
in
front
,
who
immediately
began
to
pour
round
,
pressing
upon
each
other
in
an
unbroken
stream
.
   
<EOS>
He
planted
a
board
,
which
he
had
carried
up
with
him
for
the
purpose
,
so
firmly
against
the
door
that
it
must
be
matter
of
great
difficulty
to
open
it
from
the
inside
;
and
creeping
over
the
tiles
,
looked
over
the
low
parapet
.
   
<EOS>
The
water
was
out
,
and
the
ditch
a
bed
of
mud
.
   
<EOS>
The
crowd
had
been
hushed
during
these
few
moments
,
watching
his
motions
and
doubtful
of
his
purpose
,
but
the
instant
they
perceived
it
and
knew
it
was
defeated
,
they
raised
a
cry
of
triumphant
execration
to
which
all
their
previous
shouting
had
been
whispers
.
 
<EOS>
Again
and
again
it
rose
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
were
at
too
great
a
distance
to
know
its
meaning
,
took
up
the
sound
;
it
echoed
and
re
-
echoed
;
it
seemed
as
though
the
whole
city
had
poured
its
population
out
to
curse
him
.
   
<EOS>
On
pressed
the
people
from
the
front
---
on
,
on
,
on
,
in
a
strong
struggling
current
of
angry
faces
,
with
here
and
there
a
glaring
torch
to
lighten
them
up
,
and
show
them
out
in
all
their
wrath
and
passion
.
 
<EOS>
The
houses
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
ditch
had
been
entered
by
the
mob
;
sashes
were
thrown
up
,
or
torn
bodily
out
;
there
were
tiers
and
tiers
of
faces
in
every
window
;
cluster
upon
cluster
of
people
clinging
to
every
house
-
top
.
 
<EOS>
Each
little
bridge
<EOS>
(
and
there
were
three
in
sight
)
bent
beneath
the
weight
of
the
crowd
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Still
the
current
poured
on
to
find
some
nook
or
hole
from
which
to
vent
their
shouts
,
and
only
for
an
instant
<EOS>
see
the
wretch
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
have
him
now
,
"
cried
a
man
on
the
nearest
bridge
.
<EOS>
"
Hurrah
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
crowd
grew
light
with
uncovered
heads
;
and
again
the
shout
uprose
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
give
fifty
pounds
,
"
cried
an
old
gentleman
from
the
same
quarter
,
"
to
the
man
who
takes
him
alive
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
remain
here
,
till
he
come
to
ask
me
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
another
roar
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
word
was
passed
among
the
crowd
that
the
door
was
forced
at
last
,
and
that
he
who
had
first
called
for
the
ladder
had
mounted
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
stream
abruptly
turned
,
as
this
intelligence
ran
from
mouth
to
mouth
;
and
the
people
at
the
windows
,
seeing
those
upon
the
bridges
pouring
back
,
quitted
their
stations
,
and
running
into
the
street
,
joined
the
concourse
that
now
thronged
pell
-
mell
to
the
spot
they
had
left
:
 
each
man
crushing
and
striving
with
his
neighbor
,
and
all
panting
with
impatience
to
get
near
the
door
,
and
look
upon
the
criminal
as
the
officers
brought
him
out
.
<EOS>
The
cries
and
shrieks
of
those
who
were
pressed
almost
to
suffocation
,
or
trampled
down
and
trodden
under
foot
in
the
confusion
,
were
dreadful
;
the
narrow
ways
were
completely
blocked
up
;
and
at
this
time
,
between
the
rush
of
some
to
regain
the
space
in
front
of
the
house
,
and
the
unavailing
struggles
of
others
to
extricate
themselves
from
the
mass
,
the
immediate
attention
was
distracted
from
the
murderer
,
although
the
universal
eagerness
for
his
capture
was
,
if
possible
,
increased
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
had
shrunk
down
,
thoroughly
quelled
by
the
ferocity
of
the
crowd
,
and
the
impossibility
of
escape
;
but
seeing
this
sudden
change
with
no
less
rapidity
than
it
had
occurred
,
he
sprang
upon
his
feet
,
determined
to
make
one
last
effort
for
his
life
by
dropping
into
the
ditch
,
and
,
at
the
risk
of
being
stifled
,
endeavouring
to
creep
away
in
the
darkness
and
confusion
.
   
<EOS>
Roused
into
new
strength
and
energy
,
and
stimulated
by
the
noise
within
the
house
which
announced
that
an
entrance
had
really
been
effected
,
he
set
his
foot
against
the
stack
of
chimneys
,
fastened
one
end
of
the
rope
tightly
and
firmly
round
it
,
and
with
the
other
made
a
strong
running
noose
by
the
aid
of
his
hands
and
teeth
almost
in
a
second
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
let
himself
down
by
the
cord
to
within
a
less
distance
of
the
ground
than
his
own
height
,
and
had
his
knife
ready
in
his
hand
to
cut
it
then
and
drop
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
very
instant
when
he
brought
the
loop
over
his
head
previous
to
slipping
it
beneath
his
arm
-
pits
,
and
when
the
old
gentleman
before
-
mentioned
(
who
had
clung
so
tight
to
the
railing
of
the
bridge
as
to
resist
the
force
of
the
crowd
,
and
retain
his
position
)
earnestly
warned
those
about
him
that
the
man
was
about
to
lower
himself
down
---
at
that
very
instant
the
murderer
,
looking
behind
him
on
the
roof
,
threw
his
arms
above
his
head
,
and
uttered
a
yell
of
terror
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
eyes
again
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
in
an
unearthly
screech
.
   
<EOS>
Staggering
as
if
struck
by
lightning
,
he
lost
his
balance
and
tumbled
over
the
parapet
.
 
<EOS>
The
noose
was
on
his
neck
.
<EOS>
It
ran
up
with
his
weight
,
tight
as
a
bow
-
string
,
and
swift
as
the
arrow
it
speeds
.
 
<EOS>
He
fell
for
five
-
and
-
thirty
feet
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
sudden
jerk
,
a
terrific
convulsion
of
the
limbs
;
and
there
he
hung
,
with
the
open
knife
clenched
in
his
stiffening
hand
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
chimney
quivered
with
the
shock
,
but
stood
it
bravely
.
<EOS>
The
murderer
swung
lifeless
against
the
wall
;
and
the
boy
,
thrusting
aside
the
dangling
body
which
obscured
his
view
,
called
to
the
people
to
come
and
take
him
out
,
for
God
's
sake
.
   
<EOS>
A
dog
,
which
had
lain
concealed
till
now
,
ran
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
parapet
with
a
dismal
howl
,
and
collecting
himself
for
a
spring
,
jumped
for
the
dead
man
's
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Missing
his
aim
,
he
fell
into
the
ditch
,
turning
completely
over
as
he
went
;
and
striking
his
head
against
a
stone
,
dashed
out
his
brains
.

Chapter
51
.
<EOS>
Affording
an
explanation
of
more
mysteries
than
one
,
and
comprehending
a
proposal
of
marriage
with
no
word
of
settlement
or
pin
-
money
.
 
<EOS>
The
events
narrated
in
the
last
chapter
were
yet
but
two
days
old
,
when
Oliver
found
himself
,
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
in
a
travelling
-
carriage
rolling
fast
towards
his
native
town
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Maylie
,
and
Rose
,
and
Mrs
Bedwin
,
and
the
good
doctor
were
with
him
:
 
and
Mr
Brownlow
followed
in
a
post
-
chaise
,
accompanied
by
one
other
person
whose
name
had
not
been
mentioned
.
   
<EOS>
They
had
not
talked
much
upon
the
way
;
for
Oliver
was
in
a
flutter
of
agitation
and
uncertainty
which
deprived
him
of
the
power
of
collecting
his
thoughts
,
and
almost
of
speech
,
and
appeared
to
have
scarcely
less
effect
on
his
companions
,
who
shared
it
,
in
at
least
an
equal
degree
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
the
two
ladies
had
been
very
carefully
made
acquainted
by
Mr
Brownlow
with
the
nature
of
the
admissions
which
had
been
forced
from
Monks
;
and
although
they
knew
that
the
object
of
their
present
journey
was
to
complete
the
work
which
had
been
so
well
begun
,
still
the
whole
matter
was
enveloped
in
enough
of
doubt
and
mystery
to
leave
them
in
endurance
of
the
most
intense
suspense
.
   
<EOS>
The
same
kind
friend
had
,
with
Mr
Losberne
's
assistance
,
cautiously
stopped
all
channels
of
communication
through
which
they
could
receive
intelligence
of
the
dreadful
occurrences
that
so
recently
taken
place
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
quite
true
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
they
must
know
them
before
long
,
but
it
might
be
at
a
better
time
than
the
present
,
and
it
could
not
be
at
a
worse
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
,
they
travelled
on
in
silence
:
 
<EOS>
each
busied
with
reflections
on
the
object
which
had
brought
them
together
:
 
and
no
one
disposed
to
give
utterance
to
the
thoughts
which
crowded
upon
all
.
   
<EOS>
But
if
Oliver
,
under
these
influences
,
had
remained
silent
while
they
journeyed
towards
his
birth
-
place
by
a
road
he
had
never
seen
,
how
the
whole
current
of
his
recollections
ran
back
to
old
times
,
and
what
a
crowd
of
emotions
were
wakened
up
in
his
breast
,
when
they
turned
into
that
which
he
had
traversed
on
foot
:
 
a
poor
houseless
,
wandering
boy
,
without
a
friend
to
help
him
,
or
a
roof
to
shelter
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
See
there
,
there
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Oliver
,
eagerly
clasping
the
hand
of
Rose
,
and
pointing
out
at
the
carriage
window
<EOS>
;
"
that
's
the
stile
I
came
over
;
there
are
the
hedges
I
crept
behind
,
for
fear
any
one
should
overtake
me
and
force
me
back
!
 
<EOS>
Yonder
is
the
path
across
the
fields
,
leading
to
the
old
house
where
I
was
a
little
child
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
Dick
,
Dick
,
my
dear
old
friend
,
if
I
could
only
see
you
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
him
soon
,
"
replied
Rose
,
gently
taking
his
folded
hands
between
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
tell
him
how
happy
you
are
,
and
how
rich
you
have
grown
,
and
that
in
all
your
happiness
you
have
none
so
great
as
the
coming
back
to
make
him
happy
too
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
said
Oliver
,
"
and
<EOS>
we
'll
---
we
'll
take
him
away
from
here
,
and
have
him
clothed
and
taught
,
and
send
him
to
some
quiet
country
place
where
he
may
grow
strong
and
well
,
---
shall
we
?
"
   
<EOS>
Rose
nodded
"
yes
,
"
for
the
boy
was
smiling
through
such
happy
tears
that
she
could
not
speak
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
kind
and
good
to
him
,
for
you
are
to
every
one
,
"
said
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
make
you
cry
,
I
know
,
to
hear
what
he
can
tell
;
but
never
mind
,
never
mind
<EOS>
,
it
will
be
all
over
,
and
you
will
smile
again
---
I
know
that
too
---
to
think
how
changed
he
is
;
you
did
the
same
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
"
God
bless
you
"
to
me
when
I
ran
away
,
"
cried
the
boy
with
a
burst
of
affectionate
emotion
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
will
say
"
God
bless
you
"
now
,
and
show
him
how
I
love
him
for
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
they
approached
the
town
,
and
at
length
drove
through
its
narrow
streets
,
it
became
matter
of
no
small
difficulty
to
restrain
the
boy
within
reasonable
bounds
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
Sowerberry
's
the
undertaker
's
just
as
it
used
to
be
,
only
smaller
and
less
imposing
in
appearance
than
he
remembered
it
---
there
were
all
the
well
-
known
shops
and
houses
,
with
almost
every
one
of
which
he
had
some
slight
incident
connected
---
there
was
Gamfield
's
cart
,
the
very
cart
he
used
to
have
,
standing
at
the
old
public
-
house
door
---
there
was
the
workhouse
,
the
dreary
prison
of
his
youthful
days
,
with
its
dismal
windows
frowning
on
the
street
---
there
was
the
same
lean
porter
standing
at
the
gate
,
at
sight
of
whom
Oliver
involuntarily
shrunk
back
,
and
then
laughed
at
himself
for
being
so
foolish
,
then
cried
,
then
laughed
again
---
there
were
scores
of
faces
at
the
doors
and
windows
that
he
knew
quite
well
---
there
was
nearly
everything
as
if
he
had
left
it
but
yesterday
,
and
all
his
recent
life
had
been
but
a
happy
dream
.
   
<EOS>
But
it
was
pure
,
earnest
,
joyful
reality
.
 
<EOS>
They
drove
straight
to
the
door
of
the
chief
hotel
(
which
Oliver
used
to
stare
up
at
,
with
awe
,
and
think
a
mighty
palace
,
but
which
had
somehow
fallen
off
in
grandeur
and
size
)
;
and
here
was
Mr
Grimwig
all
ready
to
receive
them
,
kissing
the
young
lady
,
and
the
old
one
too
,
when
they
got
out
of
the
coach
,
as
if
he
were
the
grandfather
of
the
whole
party
,
all
smiles
and
kindness
,
and
not
offering
to
eat
his
head
---
<EOS>
no
,
not
once
;
not
even
when
he
contradicted
a
very
old
postboy
about
the
nearest
road
to
London
,
and
maintained
he
knew
it
best
,
though
he
had
only
come
that
way
once
,
and
that
time
fast
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
dinner
prepared
,
and
there
were
bedrooms
ready
,
and
everything
was
arranged
as
if
by
magic
.
   
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
this
,
when
the
hurry
of
the
first
half
-
hour
was
over
,
the
same
silence
and
constraint
prevailed
that
had
marked
their
journey
down
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Brownlow
did
not
join
them
at
dinner
,
but
remained
in
a
separate
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
other
gentlemen
hurried
in
and
out
with
anxious
faces
,
and
,
during
the
short
intervals
when
they
were
present
,
conversed
apart
.
 
<EOS>
Once
,
Mrs
Maylie
was
called
away
,
and
after
being
absent
for
nearly
an
hour
,
returned
with
eyes
swollen
with
weeping
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
things
made
Rose
and
Oliver
,
who
were
not
in
any
new
secrets
,
nervous
and
uncomfortable
.
 
<EOS>
They
sat
wondering
,
in
silence
;
or
,
if
they
exchanged
a
few
words
,
spoke
in
whispers
,
as
if
they
were
afraid
to
hear
the
sound
of
their
own
voices
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
,
when
nine
o'clock
had
come
,
and
they
began
to
think
they
were
to
hear
no
more
that
night
,
Mr
Losberne
and
Mr
Grimwig
entered
the
room
,
followed
by
Mr
Brownlow
and
a
man
whom
Oliver
almost
shrieked
with
surprise
to
see
;
for
they
told
him
it
was
his
brother
,
and
it
was
the
same
man
he
had
met
at
the
market
-
town
,
and
seen
looking
in
with
Fagin
at
the
window
of
his
little
room
.
 
<EOS>
Monks
cast
a
look
of
hate
,
which
,
even
then
,
he
could
not
dissemble
,
at
the
astonished
boy
,
and
sat
down
near
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Brownlow
,
who
had
papers
in
his
hand
,
walked
to
a
table
near
which
Rose
and
Oliver
were
seated
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
painful
task
,
"
said
he
,
"
but
these
declarations
,
which
have
been
signed
in
London
before
many
gentlemen
,
must
be
substance
repeated
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
spared
you
the
degradation
,
but
we
must
hear
them
from
your
own
lips
before
we
part
,
and
you
know
why
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Go
on
,
"
said
the
person
addressed
,
turning
away
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quick
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
almost
done
enough
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
keep
me
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
child
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
drawing
Oliver
to
him
,
and
laying
his
hand
upon
his
head
,
"
is
your
half
-
brother
;
the
illegitimate
son
of
your
father
,
my
dear
friend
Edwin
Leeford
,
by
poor
young
Agnes
Fleming
,
who
died
in
giving
him
birth
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Monks
,
scowling
at
the
trembling
boy
:
 
the
beating
of
whose
heart
he
might
have
heard
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
bastard
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
term
you
use
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
sternly
,
"
is
a
reproach
to
those
long
since
passed
beyong
the
feeble
censure
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
reflects
disgrace
on
no
one
living
,
except
you
who
use
it
.
<EOS>
Let
that
pass
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
born
in
this
town
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
workhouse
of
this
town
,
"
was
the
sullen
reply
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
the
story
there
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
pointed
impatiently
to
the
papers
as
he
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
it
here
,
too
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
looking
round
upon
the
listeners
.
   
<EOS>
"
Listen
then
!
 
<EOS>
You
!
"
returned
Monks
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
father
being
taken
ill
at
Rome
,
was
joined
by
his
wife
,
my
mother
,
from
whom
he
had
been
long
separated
,
who
went
from
Paris
and
took
me
with
her
---
to
look
after
his
property
,
for
what
I
know
,
for
she
had
no
great
affection
for
him
,
nor
he
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
nothing
of
us
,
for
his
senses
were
gone
,
and
he
slumbered
on
till
next
day
,
when
he
died
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
papers
in
his
desk
,
were
two
,
dated
on
the
night
his
illness
first
came
on
,
directed
to
yourself
"
;
he
addressed
himself
to
Mr
Brownlow
;
"
and
enclosed
in
a
few
short
lines
to
you
,
with
an
intimation
on
the
cover
of
the
package
that
it
was
not
to
be
forwarded
till
after
he
was
dead
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
these
papers
was
a
letter
to
this
girl
Agnes
;
the
other
a
will
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
of
the
letter
?
"
asked
Mr
Brownlow
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
letter
?
---
<EOS>
A
sheet
of
paper
crossed
and
crossed
again
,
with
a
penitent
confession
,
and
prayers
to
God
to
help
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
palmed
a
tale
on
the
girl
that
some
secret
mystery
---
to
be
explained
one
day
---
prevented
his
marrying
her
just
then
;
and
so
she
had
gone
on
,
trusting
patiently
to
him
,
until
she
trusted
too
far
,
and
lost
what
none
could
ever
give
her
back
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
,
at
that
time
,
within
a
few
months
of
her
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
her
all
he
had
meant
to
do
,
to
hide
her
shame
,
if
he
had
lived
,
and
prayed
her
,
if
he
died
,
not
to
curse
him
memory
,
or
think
the
consequences
of
their
sin
would
be
visited
on
her
or
their
young
child
;
for
all
the
guilt
was
his
.
 
<EOS>
He
reminded
her
of
the
day
he
had
given
her
the
little
locket
and
the
ring
with
her
christian
name
engraved
upon
it
,
and
a
blank
left
for
that
which
he
hoped
one
day
to
have
bestowed
upon
her
---
prayed
her
yet
to
keep
it
,
and
wear
it
next
her
heart
,
as
she
had
done
before
---
and
then
ran
on
,
wildly
,
in
the
same
words
,
over
and
over
again
,
as
if
he
had
gone
distracted
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
he
had
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
will
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
as
Oliver
's
tears
fell
fast
.
   
<EOS>
Monks
was
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
will
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
speaking
for
him
,
"
was
in
the
same
spirit
as
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
He
talked
of
miseries
which
his
wife
had
brought
upon
him
;
of
the
rebellious
disposition
,
vice
,
malice
,
and
premature
bad
passions
of
you
his
only
son
,
who
had
been
trained
to
hate
him
;
and
left
you
,
and
your
mother
,
each
an
annuity
of
eight
hundred
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
The
bulk
of
his
property
he
divided
into
two
equal
portions
---
one
for
Agnes
Fleming
,
and
the
other
for
their
child
,
it
it
should
be
born
alive
,
and
ever
come
of
age
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
were
a
girl
,
it
was
to
inherit
the
money
unconditionally
;
but
if
a
boy
,
only
on
the
stipulation
that
in
his
minority
he
should
never
have
stained
his
name
with
any
public
act
of
dishonour
,
meanness
,
cowardice
,
or
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
this
,
he
said
,
to
mark
his
confidence
in
the
other
,
and
his
conviction
---
only
strengthened
by
approaching
death
---
that
the
child
would
share
her
gentle
heart
,
and
noble
nature
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
were
disappointed
in
this
expectation
,
then
the
money
was
to
come
to
you
:
 
for
then
,
and
not
till
then
,
<EOS>
when
both
children
were
equal
,
would
he
recognise
your
prior
claim
upon
his
purse
,
who
had
none
upon
his
heart
,
but
had
,
from
an
infant
,
repulsed
him
with
coldness
and
aversion
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
mother
,
"
said
Monks
,
in
a
louder
tone
,
"
did
what
a
woman
should
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
She
burnt
this
will
.
 
<EOS>
The
letter
never
reached
its
destination
;
but
that
,
and
other
proofs
,
she
kept
,
in
case
they
ever
tried
to
lie
away
the
blot
.
 
<EOS>
The
girl
's
father
had
the
truth
from
her
with
every
aggravation
that
her
violent
hate
---
I
love
her
for
it
now
---
could
add
.
 
<EOS>
Goaded
by
shame
and
dishonour
he
fled
with
his
children
into
a
remote
corner
of
Wales
,
changing
his
very
name
that
his
friends
might
never
know
of
his
retreat
;
and
here
,
no
great
while
<EOS>
afterwards
,
he
was
found
dead
in
his
bed
.
 
<EOS>
The
girl
had
left
her
home
,
in
secret
,
some
weeks
before
;
he
had
searched
for
her
,
on
foot
,
in
every
town
and
village
near
;
it
was
on
the
night
when
he
returned
home
,
<EOS>
assured
that
she
had
destroyed
herself
,
to
hide
her
shame
and
his
,
that
his
old
heart
broke
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
short
silence
here
,
until
Mr
Brownlow
took
up
the
thread
of
the
narrative
.
   
<EOS>
"
Years
after
this
,
"
he
said
,
"
this
man
's
---
Edward
Leeford
's
---
mother
came
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
left
her
,
when
only
eighteen
;
robbed
her
of
jewels
and
money
;
gambled
,
squandered
,
forged
,
and
fled
to
London
:
 
where
for
two
years
he
had
associated
with
the
lowest
outcasts
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
sinking
under
a
painful
and
incurable
disease
,
and
wished
to
recover
him
before
she
died
.
 
<EOS>
Inquiries
were
set
on
foot
,
and
strict
searches
made
.
<EOS>
They
were
unavailing
for
a
long
time
,
but
ultimately
successful
;
and
he
went
back
with
her
to
France
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
she
died
,
"
said
Monks
,
"
after
a
lingering
illness
;
and
,
on
her
death
-
bed
,
she
bequeathed
these
secrets
to
me
,
together
with
her
unquenchable
and
deadly
hatred
of
all
whom
they
involved
---
though
she
need
not
have
left
me
that
,
for
I
had
inherited
it
long
before
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
not
believe
that
the
girl
had
destroyed
herself
,
and
the
child
too
,
but
was
filled
with
the
impression
that
a
male
child
had
been
born
,
and
was
alive
.
 
<EOS>
I
swore
to
her
,
if
ever
it
crossed
my
path
,
to
hunt
it
down
;
never
to
let
it
rest
;
to
pursue
it
with
the
bitterest
and
most
unrelenting
animosity
;
to
vent
upon
it
the
hatred
that
I
deeply
felt
,
and
to
spit
upon
the
empty
vaunt
of
that
insulting
will
by
draggin
it
,
if
I
could
,
to
the
very
gallows
-
foot
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
right
.
   
<EOS>
He
came
in
my
way
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
I
began
well
;
and
,
but
for
babbling
drabs
,
I
would
have
finished
as
I
began
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
villain
folded
his
arms
tight
together
,
and
muttered
curses
on
himself
in
the
impotence
of
baffled
malice
,
Mr
Brownlow
turned
to
the
terrified
group
beside
him
,
and
explained
that
the
Jew
,
who
had
been
his
old
accomplice
and
confidant
,
had
a
large
reward
for
keeping
Oliver
ensnared
:
 
of
which
some
part
was
to
be
given
up
,
in
the
event
of
his
being
rescued
:
 
and
that
a
dispute
on
this
head
had
led
to
their
visit
to
the
country
house
for
the
purpose
of
identifying
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
locket
and
ring
?
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
turning
to
Monks
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
bought
them
from
the
man
and
woman
I
told
you
of
,
who
stole
them
from
the
nurse
,
who
stole
them
from
the
corpse
,
"
answered
Monks
without
raising
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
became
of
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Brownlow
merely
nodded
to
Mr
Grimwig
,
who
disappearing
with
great
alacrity
,
shortly
returned
,
pushing
in
Mrs
Bumble
,
and
dragging
her
unwilling
consort
after
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
my
hi
's
deceive
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Bumble
,
with
ill
-
feigned
enthusiasm
,
"
or
is
that
little
Oliver
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
O
-
li
-
ver
,
if
you
<EOS>
know'd
<EOS>
how
I
've
been
a

grieving
for
you

"
   
"
Hold
your
tongue
,
fool
,
"
murmured
Mrs
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
natur
,
natur
,
Mrs
Bumble
?
"
remonstrated
the
workhouse
master
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
I
be
supposed
to
feel
---
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
I
\
<EOS>
as
brought
him
up
porochially
---
when
I
see
him
a
-
setting
here
among
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
very
affablest
description
!
 
<EOS>
I
always
loved
that
boy
as
if
he
'd
been
my
---
<EOS>
my
---
my
own
grandfather
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
halting
for
an
appropriate
comparison
.
 
<EOS>
"
Master
Oliver
,
my
dear
<EOS>
,
you
remember
the
blessed
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
?
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
he
went
to
heaven
last
week
,
in
a
oak
coffin
with
plated
handles
,
Oliver
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Grimwig
,
tartly
;
"
suppress
your
feelings
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
my
endeavours
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
This
salutation
was
addressed
to
Mr
Brownlow
,
who
had
stepped
up
to
within
a
short
distance
of
the
respectable
couple
.
 
<EOS>
He
inquired
,
as
he
pointed
to
Monks
,
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
that
person
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Mrs
Bumble
flatly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
YOU
do
n't
?
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
addressing
her
spouse
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
him
in
all
my
life
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nor
sold
him
anything
,
perhaps
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Mrs
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
never
had
,
perhaps
,
a
certain
gold
locket
and
ring
?
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
replied
the
matron
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
are
we
brought
here
to
answer
to
such
nonsense
as
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
Again
Mr
Brownlow
nodded
to
Mr
Grimwig
;
and
again
that
gentleman
limped
away
with
extraordinary
readiness
.
 
<EOS>
But
not
again
did
he
return
with
a
stout
man
and
wife
;
for
this
time
,
he
led
in
two
palsied
women
,
who
shook
and
tottered
as
they
walked
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
shut
the
door
the
night
old
<EOS>
Sally
died
,
"
said
the
foremost
one
,
raising
her
shrivelled
hand
,
"
but
you
could
n't
shut
out
the
sound
,
nor
stop
the
chinks
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
the
other
,
looking
round
her
and
wagging
her
toothless
jaws
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
heard
her
try
to
tell
you
what
she
'd
done
,
and
saw
you
take
a
paper
from
her
hand
,
and
watched
you
too
,
next
day
,
to
the
pawnbroker
's
shop
,
"
said
the
first
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
added
the
second
,
"
and
it
was
a
"
locket
and
gold
ring
.
<EOS>
"
We
found
out
that
,
and
saw
it
given
you
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
by
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
we
were
by
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
we
know
more
than
that
,
"
resumed
the
first
,
"
for
she
told
us
often
,
long
ago
,
that
the
young
mother
had
told
her
that
,
feeling
she
should
never
get
over
it
,
she
was
on
her
way
,
at
the
time
that
she
was
taken
ill
,
to
die
near
the
grave
of
the
father
of
the
child
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
like
to
see
the
pawnbroker
himself
?
"
asked
Mr
Grimwig
with
a
motion
towards
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
the
woman
;
"
if
he
---
she
pointed
to
Monks
---
"
has
been
coward
enough
to
confess
,
as
I
see
he
had
,
and
you
have
sounded
all
these
hags
till
you
have
found
the
right
ones
,
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
DID
sell
them
,
and
they
're
where
you
'll
never
get
them
.
 
<EOS>
What
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
replied
Mr
Brownlow
,
"
except
that
it
remains
for
us
to
take
care
that
neither
of
you
is
employed
in
a
situation
of
trust
again
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
looking
about
him
with
great
ruefulness
,
as
Mr
Grimwig
disappeared
with
the
two
old
women
:
"
<EOS>
I
hope
that
this
unfortunate
little
circumstance
will
not
deprive
me
of
my
porochial
office
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
it
will
,
"
replied
Mr
Brownlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
make
up
your
mind
to
that
,
and
think
yourself
well
off
besides
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
all
Mrs
Bumble
.
 
<EOS>
She
WOULD
do
it
,
"
urged
Mr
Bumble
;
first
looking
round
to
ascertain
that
his
partner
had
left
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
no
excuse
,
"
replied
Mr
Brownlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
were
present
on
the
occasion
of
the
destruction
of
these
trinkets
,
and
indeed
are
the
more
guilty
of
the
two
,
in
the
eye
of
the
law
;
for
the
law
supposes
that
your
wife
acts
under
your
direction
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
the
law
supposes
that
,
"
said
Mr
Bumble
,
squeezing
his
hat
emphatically
in
both
hands
,
"
the
law
is
a
ass
---
a
idiot
.
 
<EOS>
If
that
's
the
eye
of
the
law
,
the
law
is
a
bachelor
;
and
the
worst
I
wish
the
law
is
,
that
his
eye
may
be
opened
by
experience
---
by
experience
.
"
   
<EOS>
Laying
great
stress
on
the
repetition
of
these
two
words
,
Mr
Bumble
fixed
his
hat
on
very
tight
,
and
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
followed
his
helpmate
downstairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Young
lady
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
turning
to
Rose
,
"
give
me
your
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
tremble
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
not
fear
to
hear
the
few
remaining
words
we
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
they
have
---
I
do
not
know
how
they
can
,
but
if
they
have
---
any
reference
to
me
,
"
said
Rose
,
"
pray
let
me
hear
them
at
some
other
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
strength
or
spirits
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
returned
the
old
gentlman
,
drawing
her
arm
through
his
;
"
you
have
more
fortitude
than
this
,
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
this
young
lady
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Monks
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
you
before
,
"
said
Rose
faintly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
you
often
,
"
returned
Monks
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
father
of
the
unhappy
Agnes
had
TWO
daughters
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
was
the
fate
of
the
other
---
the
child
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
child
,
"
replied
Monks
,
"
when
her
father
died
in
a
strange
place
,
in
a
strange
name
,
without
a
letter
,
book
,
or
scrap
of
paper
that
yielded
the
faintest
clue
by
which
his
friends
or
relatives
could
be
traced
---
the
child
was
taken
by
some
wretched
cottagers
,
who
reared
it
as
their
own
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
,
signing
to
Mrs
Maylie
to
approach
.
<EOS>
"
Go
on
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
could
n't
find
the
spot
to
which
these
people
had
repaired
,
"
said
Monks
,
"
but
where
friendship
fails
,
hatred
will
often
force
a
way
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
found
it
,
after
a
year
of
cunning
search
---
ay
,
and
found
the
child
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
took
it
,
did
she
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
were
poor
and
began
to
sicken
---
at
least
the
man
did
---
of
their
fine
humanity
;
so
she
left
it
with
them
,
giving
them
a
small
present
of
money
which
would
not
last
long
,
and
promised
more
,
which
she
never
meant
to
send
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
n't
quite
rely
,
however
,
on
their
discontent
and
poverty
for
the
child
's
unhappiness
,
but
told
the
history
of
the
sister
's
shame
,
with
such
alterations
as
suited
her
;
bade
them
take
good
heed
of
the
child
,
for
she
came
of
bad
blood
;
;
and
told
them
she
was
illegitimate
,
and
sure
to
go
wrong
at
one
time
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
The
circumstances
countenanced
all
this
;
the
people
believed
it
;
and
there
the
child
dragged
on
an
existence
,
miserable
enough
even
to
satisfy
us
,
until
a
widow
lady
,
residing
,
then
,
at
Chester
,
saw
the
girl
by
chance
,
pitied
her
,
and
took
her
home
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
some
cursed
spell
,
I
think
,
against
us
;
for
in
spite
of
all
our
efforts
she
remained
there
and
was
happy
.
 
<EOS>
I
lost
sight
of
her
,
two
or
three
years
ago
,
and
saw
her
no
more
until
a
few
months
back
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
see
her
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Leaning
on
your
arm
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
not
the
less
my
niece
,
"
cried
Mrs
Maylie
,
folding
the
fainting
girl
in
her
arms
;
"
not
the
less
my
dearest
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
lose
her
now
,
for
all
the
treasures
of
the
world

<EOS>
My
sweet
companion

my

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
only

I

cried
Rose
,
clinging
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
kindest
,
best
of
friends
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
will
burst
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
all
this
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
borne
more
,
and
have
been
,
through
all

the
best
and
gentlest
creature
that
ever

happiness
on
every
one
she
knew
,
"
said
Mrs
Maylie
,
embracing
her
tenderly
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
my
love
,
remember
who
this
is
who
waits
to
clasp
you
in
his
arms

poor
child

See
here

<EOS>
look

look

my

"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
aunt
,
"
cried
Oliver
,
throwing
his
arms
about
her
neck
;
"
I
'll
never
call
her
aunt
---
sister
,
my
own
dear
sister

that
something
taught
my
heart
to
love
so
dearly
from
the
first
!
 
<EOS>
Rose
,
dear
,
darling
Rose
!
"
   
<EOS>
Let
the
tears
which
fell
,
and
the
broken
words
which
were
exchanged
in
the
long
close
embrace
between
the
orphans
,
be
sacred
.
 
<EOS>
A
father
,
sister
,
and
mother
,
were
gained
,
and
lost
,
in
that
one
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Joy
and
grief
were
mingled
in
the
cup
;
but
there
were
no
bitter
tears
:
 
<EOS>
for
even
grief
itself
arose
so
softened
,
and
clothed
in
such
sweet
and
tender
recollections
,
that
it
became
a
solemn
pleasure
,
and
lost
all
character
of
pain
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
a
long
,
long
time
alone
.
 
<EOS>
A
soft
tap
at
the
door
,
at
length
announced
that
some
one
was
without
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
opened
it
,
glided
away
,
and
gave
place
to
Harry
Maylie

<EOS>
"
I
know
it
all
,
"
he
said
,
taking
a
seat
beside
the
lovely
girl
.
"
<EOS>
Dear
Rose
,
I
know
it
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
here
by
accident
,
"
he
added
after
a
lengthened
silence
;
"
nor
have
I
heard
all
this
to
-
night
,
for
I
knew
it
yesterday
---
only
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
guess
that
I
have
come
to
remind
you
of
a
promise
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
"
said
Rose
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
DO
know
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
.
 
<EOS>
You
gave
me
leave
,
at
any
time
within
a
year
,
to
renew
the
subject
of
our
last
discourse
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
to
press
you
to
alter
your
determination
,
"
pursued
the
young
man
,
"
but
to
hear
you
repeat
it
,
if
you
would
.
<EOS>
I
was
to
lay
whatever
of
station
or
fortune
I
might
possess
at
your
feet
,
and
if
you
still
adhered
to
your
former
determination
,
I
pledged
myself
,
by
no
word
or
act
,
to
seek
to
change
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
same
reasons
which
influenced
me
then
,
will
influence
me
know
,
"
said
Rose
firmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
ever
owed
a
strict
and
rigid
duty
to
her
,
whose
goodness
saved
me
from
a
life
of
indigence
and
suffering
,
when
should
I
ever
feel
it
,
<EOS>
as
I
should
to
-
night
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
struggle
,
"
said
Rose
,
"
but
one
I
am
proud
to
make
<EOS>
;
it
is
a
pang
,
but
one
my
heart
shall
bear
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
disclosure
of
to
-
night
,
"
---
Harry
began
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
disclosure
of
to
-
night
,
"
replied
Rose
softly
,
"
leaves
me
in
the
same
position
,
with
reference
to
you
,
as
that
in
which
I
stood
before
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
harden
your
heart
against
me
,
Rose
,
"
urged
her
lover
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
Harry
,
Harry
,
"
said
the
young
lady
,
bursting
into
tears
;
"
I
wish
I
could
,
and
spare
myself
this
pain
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
why
inflict
it
on
yourself
?
"
<EOS>
said
Harry
,
taking
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Think
,
dear
Rose
,
think
what
you
have
heard
to
-
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
have
I
heard
!
 
<EOS>
What
have
I
heard
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rose
.
<EOS>
"
That
a
sense
of
his
deep
disgrace
so
worked
upon
my
own
father
that
he
shunned
all
---
there
,
we
have
said
enough
,
Harry
,
we
have
said
enough
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
,
not
yet
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
detaining
her
as
she
rose
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
hopes
,
my
wishes
,
prospects
,
feeling
:
 
every
thought
in
life
except
my
love
for
you
:
 
have
undergone
a
change
.
 
<EOS>
I
offer
you
,
now
,
no
distinction
among
a
bustling
crowd
;
no
mingling
with
a
world
of
malice
and
detraction
,
where
the
blood
is
called
into
honest
cheeks
by
aught
but
real
disgrace
and
shame
;
but
a
home
---
a
heart
and
home
---
<EOS>
yes
,
dearest
Rose
,
and
those
,
and
those
alone
,
are
all
I
have
to
offer
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
!
<EOS>
"
she
faltered
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
<EOS>
but
this
---
<EOS>
that
when
I
left
you
last
,
I
left
you
with
a
firm
determination
to
level
all
fancied
barriers
between
yourself
and
me
;
resolved
that
if
my
world
could
not
be
yours
,
I
would
make
yours
mine
;
that
no
pride
of
birth
should
curl
the
lip
at
you
,
for
I
would
turn
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
This
I
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
have
shrunk
from
me
because
of
this
,
have
shrunk
from
you
,
and
proved
you
so
far
right
.
 
<EOS>
Such
power
and
patronage
:
 
such
relatives
of
influence
and
rank
:
 
as
smiled
upon
me
then
,
look
coldly
now
;
but
there
are
smiling
fields
and
waving
trees
in
England
's
richest
county
;
and
by
one
village
church
---
mine
,
Rose
,
my
own
!
<EOS>
---
there
stands
a
rustic
dwelling
which
you
can
make
me
prouder
of
,
than
all
the
hopes
I
have
renounced
,
measured
a
thousandfold
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
my
rank
and
station
now
,
and
here
I
lay
it
down
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
trying
thing
waiting
supper
for
lovers
,
"
said
Mr
Grimwig
,
waking
up
,
and
pulling
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
from
over
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
Truth
to
tell
,
the
supper
had
been
waiting
a
most
unreasonable
time
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
Mrs
Maylie
,
nor
Harry
,
nor
Rose
(
who
all
came
in
together
)
,
could
offer
a
word
in
extenuation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
serious
thoughts
of
eating
my
head
to
-
night
,
"
said
Mr
Grimwig
,
"
for
I
began
to
think
I
should
get
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
take
the
liberty
,
if
you
'll
allow
me
,
of
saluting
the
bride
that
is
to
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grimwig
lost
no
time
in
carrying
this
notice
into
effect
upon
the
blushing
girl
;
and
the
example
,
being
contagious
,
was
followed
both
by
the
doctor
and
Mr
Brownlow
:
 
some
people
affirm
that
Harry
Maylie
had
been
observed
to
set
it
,
originally
,
in
a
dark
room
adjoining
;
but
the
best
authorities
consider
this
downright
scandal
:
 
he
being
young
and
a
clergyman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oliver
,
my
child
,
"
said
Mrs
Maylie
,
"
where
have
you
been
,
<EOS>
and
why
do
you
look
so
sad
?
 
<EOS>
There
are
tears
stealing
down
your
face
at
this
moment
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
is
a
world
of
disappointment
:
 
often
to
the
hopes
we
most
cherish
,
and
hopes
that
do
our
nature
the
greatest
honour
.

Poor
Dick
was

<EOS>
Chapter
52
.
<EOS>
Fagin
's
last
night
alive
.
 
<EOS>
The
court
was
paved
,
from
floor
to
roof
,
with
human
faces
.
<EOS>
Inquisitive
and
eager
eyes
peered
from
every
inch
of
space
.
<EOS>
From
the
rail
before
the
dock
,
away
into
the
sharpest
angle
of
the
smallest
corner
in
the
galleries
,
all
looks
were
fixed
upon
one
man
---
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
Before
him
and
behind
:
 
above
,
below
,
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
:
 
he
seemed
to
stand
surrounded
by
a
firmament
,
all
bright
with
gleaming
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
He
stood
there
,
in
all
this
glare
of
living
light
,
with
one
hand
resting
on
the
wooden
slab
before
him
,
the
other
held
to
his
ear
,
and
his
head
thrust
forward
to
enable
him
to
catch
with
greater
distinctness
every
word
that
fell
from
the
presiding
judge
,
who
was
delivering
his
charge
to
the
jury
.
 
<EOS>
At
times
,
he
turned
his
eyes
sharply
upon
them
to
observe
the
effect
of
the
slightest
featherweight
in
his
favour
;
and
when
the
points
against
him
were
stated
with
terrible
distinctness
,
looked
towards
his
counsel
,
in
mute
appeal
that
he
would
,
even
then
,
urge
something
in
his
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
Beyond
these
manifestations
of
anxiety
,
he
stirred
not
hand
or
foot
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
moved
since
the
trial
began
;
and
now
that
the
judge
ceased
to
speak
,
he
still
remained
in
the
same
strained
attitude
of
close
attention
,
with
his
gaze
ben
on
him
,
as
though
he
listened
still
.
   
<EOS>
A
slight
bustle
in
the
court
,
recalled
him
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
round
,
he
saw
that
the
juryman
had
turned
together
,
to
consider
their
verdict
.
 
<EOS>
As
his
eyes
wandered
to
the
gallery
,
he
could
see
the
people
rising
above
each
other
to
see
his
face
:
 
some
hastily
applying
their
glasses
to
their
eyes
:
 
and
others
whispering
their
neighbours
with
looks
expressive
of
abhorrence
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
there
were
,
who
seemed
unmindful
of
him
,
and
looked
only
to
the
jury
,
in
impatient
wonder
how
they
could
delay
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
no
one
face
---
not
even
among
the
women
,
of
whom
there
were
many
there
---
could
he
read
the
faintest
sympathy
with
himself
,
or
any
feeling
but
one
of
all
-
absorbing
interest
that
he
should
be
condemned
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
saw
all
this
in
one
bewildered
glance
,
the
deathlike
stillness
came
again
,
and
looking
back
<EOS>
he
saw
that
the
jurymen
had
turned
towards
the
judge
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
!
   
<EOS>
They
only
sought
permission
to
retire
.
   
<EOS>
He
looked
,
wistfully
,
into
their
faces
,
one
by
one
when
they
passed
out
,
as
though
to
see
which
way
the
greater
number
leant
;
but
that
was
fruitless
.
 
<EOS>
The
jailed
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
followed
mechanically
to
the
end
of
the
dock
,
and
sat
down
on
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
pointed
it
out
,
or
he
would
not
have
seen
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
looked
up
into
the
gallery
again
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
people
were
eating
,
and
some
fanning
themselves
with
handkerchiefs
;
for
the
crowded
place
was
very
hot
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
one
young
man
sketching
his
face
in
a
little
note
-
book
.
 
<EOS>
He
wondered
whether
it
was
like
,
and
looked
on
when
the
artist
broke
his
pencil
-
point
,
and
made
another
with
his
knife
,
as
any
idle
spectator
might
have
done
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
same
way
,
when
he
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
judge
,
his
mind
began
to
busy
itself
with
the
fashion
of
his
dress
,
and
what
it
cost
,
and
how
he
put
it
on
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
old
fat
gentleman
on
the
bench
,
too
,
who
had
gone
out
,
some
half
an
hour
before
,
and
now
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
He
wondered
within
himself
whether
this
man
had
been
to
get
his
dinner
,
what
he
had
had
,
and
where
he
had
had
it
;
and
pursued
this
train
of
careless
thought
until
some
new
object
caught
his
eye
and
roused
another
.
   
<EOS>
Not
that
,
all
this
time
,
his
mind
was
,
for
an
instant
,
free
from
one
oppressive
overwhelming
sense
of
the
grave
that
opened
at
his
feet
;
it
was
ever
present
to
him
,
but
in
a
vague
and
general
way
,
and
he
could
not
fix
his
thoughts
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
even
while
he
trembled
,
and
turned
burning
hot
at
the
idea
of
speedy
death
,
he
fell
to
counting
the
iron
spikes
before
him
,
and
wondering
how
the
head
of
one
had
been
broken
off
,
and
whether
they
would
mend
it
,
or
leave
it
as
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
thought
of
all
the
horrors
of
the
gallows
and
the
scaffold
---
and
stopped
to
watch
a
man
sprinkling
the
floor
to
cool
it
---
and
then
went
on
to
think
again
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
there
was
a
cry
of
silence
,
and
a
breathless
look
from
all
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
The
jury
returned
,
and
passed
him
close
.
<EOS>
He
could
glean
nothing
from
their
faces
;
they
might
as
well
have
been
of
stone
.
 
<EOS>
Perfect
stillness
ensued
---
not
a
rustle
---
not
a
breath
---
Guilty
.
   
<EOS>
The
building
rang
with
a
tremendous
shout
,
and
another
,
and
another
,
and
<EOS>
then
it
echoed
loud
groans
,
that
gathered
strength
as
they
swelled
out
,
like
angry
thunder
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
peal
of
joy
from
the
populace
outside
,
greeting
the
news
that
he
would
die
on
Monday
.
   
<EOS>
The
noise
subsided
,
and
he
was
asked
if
he
had
anything
to
say
why
sentence
of
death
should
not
be
passed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
resumed
his
listening
attitude
,
and
looked
intently
at
his
questioner
while
the
demand
was
made
;
but
it
was
twice
repeated
before
he
seemed
to
hear
it
,
and
then
he
only
muttered
that
he
was
an
old
man
---
an
old
man
---
and
<EOS>
so
,
dropping
into
a
whisper
,
was
silent
again
.
   
<EOS>
The
judge
assumed
the
black
cap
,
and
the
prisoner
still
stood
with
the
same
air
and
gesture
.
 
<EOS>
A
woman
in
the
gallery
,
uttered
some
exclamation
,
called
forth
by
this
dread
solemnity
;
he
looked
hastily
up
as
if
angry
at
the
interruption
,
and
bent
forward
yet
more
attentively
.
 
<EOS>
The
address
was
solemn
and
impressive
;
the
sentence
fearful
to
hear
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
stood
,
like
a
marble
figure
,
without
the
motion
of
a
nerve
.
 
<EOS>
His
haggard
face
was
still
thrust
forward
,
<EOS>
his
under
-
jaw
hanging
down
,
and
his
eyes
staring
out
before
him
,
when
the
jailer
put
his
hand
upon
his
arm
,
and
beckoned
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
gazed
stupidly
about
him
for
an
instant
,
and
obeyed
.
   
<EOS>
They
led
him
through
a
paved
room
under
the
court
,
where
some
prisoners
were
waiting
till
their
turns
came
,
and
others
were
talking
to
their
friends
,
who
crowded
round
a
grate
which
looked
into
the
open
yard
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nobody
there
to
speak
to
HIM
;
but
,
as
he
passed
,
the
prisoners
fell
back
to
render
him
more
visible
to
the
people
who
were
clinging
to
the
bars
:
 
and
they
assailed
him
with
opprobrious
names
,
and
screeched
and
hissed
.
 
<EOS>
He
shook
his
fist
,
and
would
have
spat
upon
them
;
but
his
conductors
hurried
him
on
,
through
a
gloomy
passage
lighted
by
a
few
dim
lamps
,
into
the
interior
of
the
prison
.
   
<EOS>
Here
,
he
was
searched
,
that
he
might
not
have
about
him
the
means
of
anticipating
the
law
;
this
ceremony
performed
,
they
led
him
to
one
of
the
condemned
cells
,
and
left
him
there
---
alone
.
   
<EOS>
He
sat
down
on
a
stone
bench
opposite
the
door
,
which
served
for
seat
and
bedstead
;
and
casting
his
blood
-
shot
eyes
upon
the
ground
,
tried
to
collect
his
thoughts
.
<EOS>
After
awhile
,
he
began
to
remember
a
few
disjointed
fragments
of
what
the
judge
had
said
:
though
it
had
seemed
to
him
,
at
the
time
,
that
he
could
not
hear
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
These
gradually
fell
into
their
proper
places
,
and
by
degrees
suggested
more
:
 
so
that
in
a
little
time
he
had
the
whole
,
almost
as
it
was
delivered
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
hanged
by
the
neck
,
till
he
was
dead
<EOS>
---
that
was
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
hanged
by
the
neck
till
he
was
dead
.
   
<EOS>
As
it
came
on
very
dark
,
he
began
to
think
of
all
the
men
he
had
known
who
had
died
upon
the
scaffold
;
some
of
them
through
his
means
.
 
<EOS>
They
rose
up
,
in
such
quick
succession
,
that
he
could
hardly
count
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
seen
some
of
them
die
,
---
and
had
joked
too
,
because
they
died
with
prayers
upon
their
lips
.
 
<EOS>
With
what
a
rattling
noise
the
drop
went
down
;
and
how
suddenly
they
changed
,
from
strong
and
vigorous
men
to
dangling
heaps
of
clothes
!
   
<EOS>
Some
of
them
might
have
inhabited
that
very
cell
---
sat
upon
that
very
spot
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
dark
;
why
did
n't
they
bring
a
light
?
 
<EOS>
The
cell
had
been
built
for
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
Scores
of
men
must
have
passed
their
last
hours
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
like
sitting
in
a
vault
strewn
with
dead
bodies
---
the
cap
,
the
noose
,
the
pinioned
arms
,
the
faces
that
he
knew
,
even
beneath
that
hideous
veil
.
<EOS>
---
Light
,
light
!
   
<EOS>
At
length
,
when
his
hands
were
raw
with
beating
against
the
heavy
door
and
walls
,
two
men
appeared
:
 
<EOS>
one
bearing
a
candle
,
which
he
thrust
into
an
iron
candlestick
fixed
against
the
wall
:
 
the
other
dragging
in
a
mattress
on
which
to
pass
the
night
;
for
the
prisoner
was
to
be
left
alone
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
Then
came
the
night
---
dark
,
dismal
,
silent
night
.
 
<EOS>
Other
watchers
are
glad
to
hear
this
church
-
clock
strike
,
for
they
tell
of
life
and
coming
day
.
 
<EOS>
To
him
they
brought
despair
.
 
<EOS>
The
boom
of
every
iron
bell
came
laden
with
the
one
,
deep
,
hollow
sound
---
Death
.
<EOS>
What
availed
the
noise
and
bustle
of
cheerful
morning
,
which
penetrated
even
there
,
to
him
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
another
form
of
knell
,
with
mockery
added
to
the
warning
.
   
<EOS>
The
day
passed
off
.
 
<EOS>
Day
?
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
day
;
it
was
gone
as
soon
as
come
---
and
night
came
on
again
;
night
so
long
,
and
yet
so
short
;
long
in
its
dreadful
silence
,
and
short
in
its
fleeting
hours
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
time
he
raved
and
blasphemed
;
and
at
another
howled
and
tore
his
hair
.
 
<EOS>
Venerable
men
of
his
own
persuasion
had
come
to
pray
beside
him
,
but
he
had
driven
them
away
with
curses
.
 
<EOS>
They
renewed
their
charitable
efforts
,
and
he
beat
them
off
.
   
<EOS>
Saturday
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
only
one
night
more
to
live
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
thought
of
this
,
the
day
broke
---
Sunday
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
the
night
of
this
last
awful
day
,
that
a
withering
sense
of
his
helpless
,
desperate
state
came
in
its
full
intensity
upon
his
blighted
soul
;
not
that
he
had
ever
held
any
defined
or
positive
hope
of
mercy
,
but
that
he
had
never
been
able
to
consider
more
than
the
dim
probability
of
dying
so
soon
.
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
little
to
either
of
the
two
men
,
who
relieved
each
other
in
their
attendance
upon
him
;
and
they
,
for
their
parts
,
made
no
effort
to
rouse
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
sat
there
,
awake
,
but
dreaming
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
he
started
up
,
every
minute
,
and
with
gasping
mouth
and
burning
skin
,
hurried
to
and
fro
,
in
such
a
paroxysm
of
fear
and
wrath
that
even
they
---
used
to
such
sights
---
recoiled
from
him
with
horror
.
 
<EOS>
He
grew
so
terrible
,
at
last
,
in
all
the
tortures
of
his
evil
conscience
,
that
one
man
could
not
bear
to
sit
there
,
eyeing
him
alone
;
and
so
the
two
kept
watch
together
.
   
<EOS>
He
cowered
down
upon
his
stone
bed
,
and
thought
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
wounded
with
some
missiles
from
the
crowd
on
the
day
of
his
capture
,
and
his
head
was
bandaged
with
a
linen
cloth
.
 
<EOS>
His
red
hair
hung
down
upon
his
bloodless
face
;
his
beard
was
torn
,
and
twisted
into
knots
;
his
eyes
shone
with
a
terrible
light
;
his
unwashed
flesh
crackled
with
the
fever
that
burnt
him
up
.
<EOS>
Eight
---
nine
---
then
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
was
not
a
trick
to
frighten
him
,
and
those
were
the
real
hours
treading
on
each
other
's
heels
,
where
would
he
be
,
when
they
came
round
again
!
 
<EOS>
Eleven
!
 
<EOS>
Another
struck
,
before
the
voice
of
the
previous
hour
had
ceased
to
vibrate
.
 
<EOS>
At
eight
,
he
would
be
the
only
mourner
in
his
own
funeral
train
;
at
eleven
---
    
Those
dreadful
walls
of
Newgate
,
which
have
hidden
so
much
misery
and
such
unspeakable
anguish
,
not
only
from
the
eyes
,
but
,
too
often
,
and
too
long
,
from
the
thoughts
,
of
men
,
never
held
so
dread
a
spectacle
as
that
.
 
<EOS>
The
few
who
lingered
as
they
passed
,
and
wondered
what
the
man
was
doing
who
was
to
be
hanged
to
-
morrow
,
would
have
slept
but
ill
that
night
,
if
they
could
have
seen
him
.
   
<EOS>
From
early
in
the
evening
until
nearly
midnight
,
little
groups
of
two
and
three
presented
themselves
at
the
lodge
-
gate
,
and
inquired
,
with
anxious
faces
,
whether
any
reprieve
had
been
received
.
 
<EOS>
These
being
answered
in
the
negative
,
communicated
the
welcome
intelligence
to
clusters
in
the
street
,
who
pointed
out
to
one
another
the
door
from
which
he
must
come
out
,
and
showed
where
the
scaffold
would
be
built
,
and
,
walking
with
unwilling
steps
away
,
turned
back
to
conjure
up
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
By
degrees
they
fell
off
,
one
by
one
;
and
,
for
an
hour
,
in
the
dead
of
night
,
the
street
was
left
to
solitude
and
darkness
.
   
<EOS>
The
space
before
the
prison
was
cleared
,
and
a
few
strong
barriers
,
painted
black
,
had
been
already
thrown
across
the
road
to
break
the
pressure
of
the
expected
crowd
,
when
Mr
Brownlow
and
Oliver
appeared
at
the
wicket
,
and
presented
an
order
of
admission
to
the
prisoner
,
signed
by
one
of
the
sheriffs
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
immediately
admitted
into
the
lodge
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
the
young
gentleman
to
come
too
,
sir
?
"
said
the
man
whose
duty
it
was
to
conduct
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
a
sight
for
children
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
indeed
,
my
friend
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Brownlow
;
"
but
my
business
with
this
man
is
intimately
connected
with
him
;
and
as
this
child
has
seen
him
in
the
full
career
of
his
success
and
villainy
,
I
think
it
as
well
---
even
at
the
cost
of
some
pain
and
fear
---
that
he
should
see
him
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
These
few
words
had
been
said
apart
,
so
as
to
be
inaudible
to
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
touched
his
hat
;
and
glancing
at
Oliver
with
some
curiousity
,
opened
another
gate
,
opposite
to
that
by
which
they
had
entered
,
and
led
them
on
,
through
dark
and
winding
ways
,
towards
the
cells
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
said
the
man
,
stopping
in
a
gloomy
passage
where
a
couple
of
workmen
were
making
some
preparations
in
profound
silence
---
"
this
is
the
place
he
passes
through
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
step
this
way
,
you
can
see
the
door
he
goes
out
at
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
led
them
into
a
stone
kitchen
,
fitted
with
coppers
for
dressing
the
prison
food
,
and
pointed
to
a
door
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
open
grating
above
it
,
throught
which
came
the
sound
of
men
's
voices
,
mingled
with
the
noise
of
hammering
,
and
the
throwing
down
of
boards
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
putting
up
the
scaffold
.
   
<EOS>
From
this
place
,
they
passed
through
several
strong
gates
,
opened
by
other
turnkeys
from
the
inner
side
;
and
,
having
entered
an
open
yard
,
ascended
a
flight
of
narrow
steps
,
and
came
into
a
passage
with
a
row
of
strong
doors
on
the
left
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Motioning
them
to
remain
where
they
were
,
the
turnkey
knocked
at
one
of
these
with
his
bunch
of
keys
.
<EOS>
The
two
attendants
,
after
a
little
whispering
,
came
out
into
the
passage
,
stretching
themselves
as
if
glad
of
the
temporary
relief
,
and
motioned
the
visitors
to
follow
the
jailer
into
the
cell
.
 
<EOS>
They
did
so
.
   
<EOS>
The
condemned
criminal
was
seated
on
his
bed
,
rocking
himself
from
side
to
side
,
with
a
countenance
more
like
that
of
a
snared
beast
than
the
face
of
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
His
mind
was
evidently
wandering
to
his
old
life
,
for
he
continued
to
mutter
,
without
appearing
conscious
of
their
presence
otherwise
than
as
a
part
of
his
vision
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
boy
,
Charley
---
well
done
---
"
he
mumbled
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oliver
,
too
,
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Oliver
too
---
quite
the
gentleman
now
<EOS>
---
quite
the
---
take
that
boy
away
to
bed
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
jailer
took
the
disengaged
hand
of
Oliver
;
and
,
whispering
him
not
to
be
alarmed
,
looked
on
without
speaking
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
him
away
to
bed
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
me
,
some
of
you
?
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
the
---
<EOS>
the
---
somehow
the
cause
of
all
this
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
worth
the
money
to
bring
him
up
to
it
---
<EOS>
Bolter
's
throat
,
Bill
<EOS>
;
never
mind
the
girl
---
<EOS>
Bolter
's
throat
as
deep
as
you
can
cut
.
 
<EOS>
Saw
his
head
off
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fagin
,
"
said
the
jailer
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
Jew
,
falling
instantly
,
into
the
attitude
of
listening
he
had
assumed
upon
his
trial
.
 
<EOS>
"
An
old
man
,
my
Lord
;
a
very
old
,
old
man
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
,
"
said
the
turnkey
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
breast
to
keep
him
down
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
somebody
wants
to
see
you
,
to
ask
you
some
questions
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
Fagin
,
Fagin
!
 
<EOS>
Are
you
a
man
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
sha
n't
be
one
long
,
"
he
replied
,
looking
up
with
a
face
retaining
no
human
expression
but
rage
and
terror
.
 
<EOS>
"
Strike
them
all
dead
!
 
<EOS>
What
right
have
they
to
butcher
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
he
caught
sight
of
Oliver
and
Mr
Brownlow
.
<EOS>
Shrinking
to
the
furthest
corner
of
the
seat
,
he
demanded
to
know
what
they
wanted
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
Steady
,
"
said
the
turnkey
,
still
holding
him
down
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
sir
,
tell
him
what
you
want
.
 
<EOS>
Quick
,
if
you
please
,
for
he
grows
worse
as
the
time
gets
on
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
some
papers
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
advancing
,
"
which
were
placed
in
your
hands
,
for
better
security
,
by
a
man
called
Monks
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
a
lie
together
,
"
replied
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
one
---
not
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
the
love
of
God
,
"
said
Mr
Brownlow
solemnly
,
"
do
not
say
that
now
,
upon
the
very
verge
of
death
;
but
tell
me
where
they
are
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
Sikes
is
dead
;
that
Monks
has
confessed
;
that
there
is
no
hope
of
any
further
gain
.
 
<EOS>
Where
are
those
papers
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oliver
,
"
cried
Fagin
,
beckoning
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
here
!
<EOS>
Let
me
whisper
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
afraid
,
"
said
Oliver
in
a
low
voice
,
as
he
relinquished
Mr
Brownlow
's
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
papers
,
"
said
Fagin
,
drawing
Oliver
towards
him
,
"
are
in
a
canvas
bag
,
in
a
hole
a
little
way
up
the
chimney
in
the
top
front
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
talk
to
you
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
talk
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
returned
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
say
a
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
Do
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
say
one
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
Say
only
one
,
upon
your
knees
,
with
me
,
and
we
will
talk
till
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Outside
,
outside
,
"
replied
Fagin
,
pushing
the
boy
before
him
towards
the
door
,
and
looking
vacantly
over
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
Say
I
've
gone
to
sleep
---
they
'll
believe
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
get
me
out
,
if
you
take
me
so
.
 
<EOS>
Now
then
,
now
then
!
"
   
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
this
wretched
man
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
boy
with
a
burst
of
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
that
's
right
,
"
said
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
'll
help
us
on
.
<EOS>
This
door
first
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
shake
and
tremble
,
as
we
pass
the
gallows
,
do
n't
you
mind
,
but
hurry
on
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
now
,
now
!
<EOS>
"
   
"
Have
you
nothing
else
to
ask
him
,
sir
?
"
inquired
the
turnkey
.

"
No
other
question
,
"
replied
Mr
Brownlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
hoped
we
could
recall
him
to
a
sense
of
his
position
---
"
   
"
Nothing
will
do
that
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
man
,
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
leave
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
door
of
the
cell
opened
,
and
the
attendants
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Press
on
,
press
on
,
"
cried
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Softly
,
but
not
so
slow
.
<EOS>
Faster
,
faster
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
men
laid
hands
upon
him
,
and
disengaging
Oliver
from
his
grasp
,
held
him
back
.
 
<EOS>
He
struggled
with
the
power
of
desperation
,
for
an
instant
;
and
then
sent
up
cry
upon
cry
that
penetrated
even
those
massive
walls
,
and
rang
in
their
ears
until
they
reached
the
open
yard
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
some
time
before
they
left
the
prison
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
nearly
swooned
after
this
frightful
scene
,
and
was
so
weak
that
for
an
hour
or
more
,
he
had
not
the
strength
to
walk
.
   
<EOS>
Day
was
dawning
when
they
again
emerged
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
multitude
had
already
assembled
;
the
windows
were
filled
with
people
,
smoking
and
playing
cards
to
beguile
the
time
;
the
crowd
were
pushing
,
quarrelling
,
joking
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
told
of
life
and
animation
,
but
one
dark
cluster
of
objects
in
the
centre
of
all
---
<EOS>
the
black
stage
,
the
cross
-
beam
,
the
rope
,
and
all
the
hideous
apparatus
of
death
.
    
Chapter

<EOS>
And
last
.
 
<EOS>
The
fortunes
of
those
who
have
figured
in
this
tale
are
nearly
closed
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
that
remains
to
their
historian
to
relate
,
is
told
in
few
and
simple
words
.
   
<EOS>
Before
three
months
had
passed
,
Rose
Fleming
and
Harry
Maylie
were
married
in
the
village
church
which
was
henceforth
to
be
the
scene
of
the
young
clergyman
's
labours
;
on
the
same
day
they
entered
into
possession
of
their
new
and
happy
home
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Maylie
took
up
her
abode
with
her
son
and
daughter
-
in
-
law
,
to
enjoy
,
during
the
tranquil
remainder
of
her
days
,
the
greatest
felicity
that
age
and
worth
can
know
---
the
contemplation
of
the
happiness
of
those
on
whom
the
warmest
affections
and
tenderest
cares
of
a
well
-
spent
life
,
have
been
unceasingly
bestowed
.
   
<EOS>
It
appeared
,
on
full
and
careful
investigation
,
that
if
the
wreck
of
property
remaining
in
the
custody
of
Monks
(
which
had
never
prospered
either
in
his
hands
or
in
those
of
his
mother
)
were
equally
divided
between
himself
and
Oliver
,
it
would
yield
,
to
each
,
little
more
than
three
thousand
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
provisions
of
his
father
's
will
,
Oliver
would
have
been
entitled
to
the
whole
;
but
Mr
Brownlow
,
unwilling
to
deprive
the
elder
son
of
the
opportunity
of
retrieving
his
former
vices
and
pursuing
an
honest
career
,
proposed
this
mode
of
distribution
,
to
which
his
young
charge
joyfully
acceded
.
   
<EOS>
Monks
,
still
bearing
that
assumed
name
,
retired
with
his
portion
to
a
distant
part
of
the
New
World
;
where
,
having
quickly
squandered
it
,
he
once
more
fell
into
his
old
courses
,
and
,
after
undergoing
a
long
confinement
for
some
fresh
act
of
fraud
and
knavery
,
at
length
sunk
under
an
attack
of
his
old
disorder
,
and
died
in
prison
.
 
<EOS>
As
far
from
home
,
died
the
chief
remaining
members
of
his
friend
Fagin
's
gang
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Brownlow
adopted
Oliver
as
his
son
.
 
<EOS>
Removing
with
him
and
the
old
housekeeper
to
within
a
mile
of
the
parsonage
-
house
,
where
his
dear
friends
resided
,
he
gratified
the
only
remaining
wish
of
Oliver
's
warm
and
earnest
heart
,
and
thus
linked
together
a
little
society
,
whose
condition
approached
as
nearly
to
one
of
perfect
happiness
as
can
ever
be
known
in
this
changing
world
.
   
<EOS>
Soon
after
the
marriage
of
the
young
people
,
the
worthy
doctor
returned
to
Chertsey
,
where
,
bereft
of
the
presence
of
his
old
friends
,
he
would
have
been
discontented
if
his
temperament
had
admitted
of
such
a
feeling
;
and
would
have
turned
quite
peevish
if
he
had
known
how
.
 
<EOS>
For
two
or
three
months
,
he
contented
himself
with
hinting
that
he
feared
the
air
began
to
disagree
with
him
;
then
,
finding
that
the
place
really
no
longer
was
,
to
him
,
what
it
had
been
,
he
settled
his
business
on
his
assistant
,
took
a
bachelor
's
cottage
outside
the
village
of
which
his
young
friend
was
pastor
,
and
instantaneously
recovered
.
 
<EOS>
Here
he
took
to
gardening
,
planting
,
fishing
,
carpentering
,
and
various
other
pursuits
of
a
similar
kind
:
 
all
undertaken
with
his
characteristic
impetuosity
.
 
<EOS>
In
each
and
all
he
has
since
become
famous
throughout
the
neighborhood
,
as
a
most
profound
authority
.
   
<EOS>
Before
his
removal
,
he
had
managed
to
contract
a
strong
friendship
for
Mr
Grimwig
,
which
that
eccentric
gentleman
cordially
reciprocated
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
accordingly
visited
by
Mr
Grimwig
a
great
many
times
in
the
course
of
the
year
.
 
<EOS>
On
all
such
occasions
,
Mr
Grimwig
plants
,
fishes
,
and
carpenters
,
with
great
ardour
;
doing
everything
in
a
very
singular
and
unprecedented
manner
,
but
always
maintaining
with
his
favourite
asseveration
,
that
his
mode
is
the
right
one
.
 
<EOS>
On
Sundays
,
he
never
fails
to
criticise
the
sermon
to
the
young
clergyman
's
face
:
 
always
informing
Mr
Losberne
,
in
strict
confidence
afterwards
,
that
he
considers
it
an
excellent
performance
,
but
deems
it
as
well
not
to
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
standing
and
very
favourite
joke
,
for
Mr
Brownlow
to
rally
him
on
his
old
prophecy
concerning
Oliver
,
and
to
remind
him
of
the
night
on
which
they
sat
with
the
watch
between
them
,
waiting
his
return
;
but
Mr
Grimwig
contends
that
he
was
right
in
the
main
,
and
,
in
proof
thereof
,
remarks
that
Oliver
did
not
come
back
after
all
;
which
always
calls
forth
a
laugh
on
his
side
,
and
increases
his
good
humour
.

Mr
Noah
Claypole
:
 
<EOS>
receiving
a
free
pardon
from
the
Crown
in
consequence
of
being
admitted
approver
against
Fagin
:
 
and
considering
his
profession
not
altogether
as
safe
a
one
as
he
could
wish
:
 
was
,
for
some
little
time
,
at
a
loss
for
the
means
of
a
livelihood
,
not
burdened
with
too
much
work
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
consideration
,
he
went
into
business
as
an
Informer
,
in
which
calling
he
realises
a
genteel
subsistence
.
 
<EOS>
His
plan
is
,
to
walk
out
once
a
week
during
church
time
attended
by
Charlotte
in
respectable
attire
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
faints
away
at
the
doors
of
charitable
publicans
,
and
the
gentleman
being
accommodated
with
three
-
penny
worth
of
brandy
to
restore
her
,
lays
an
information
next
day
,
and
pockets
half
the
penalty
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
Mr
Claypole
faints
himself
,
but
the
result
is
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Bumble
,
deprived
of
their
situations
,
were
gradually
reduced
to
great
indigence
and
misery
,
and
finally
became
paupers
in
that
very
same
workhouse
in
which
they
had
once
lorded
it
over
others
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
has
been
heard
to
say
,
that
in
this
reverse
and
degradation
,
he
has
not
even
spirits
to
be
thankful
for
being
separated
from
his
wife
.
   
<EOS>
As
to
Mr
Giles
and
Brittles
,
they
still
remain
in
their
old
posts
,
although
the
former
is
bald
,
and
the
last
-
named
boy
quite
grey
.
 
<EOS>
They
sleep
at
the
parsonage
,
but
divide
their
attentions
so
equally
among
its
inmates
,
and
Oliver
and
Mr
Brownlow
,
and
Mr
Losberne
,
that
to
this
day
the
villagers
have
never
been
able
to
discover
to
which
establishment
they
properly
belong
.
   
<EOS>
Master
Charles
Bates
,
appalled
by
Sikes
's
crime
,
fell
into
a
train
of
reflection
whether
an
honest
life
was
not
,
after
all
,
the
best
.
 
<EOS>
Arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
it
certainly
was
,
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
scenes
of
the
past
,
resolved
to
amend
it
in
some
new
sphere
of
action
.
 
<EOS>
He
struggled
hard
,
and
suffered
much
,
for
some
time
;
but
,
having
a
contented
disposition
,
and
a
good
purpose
,
succeeded
in
the
end
;
and
,
from
being
a
farmer
's
drudge
,
and
a
carrier
's
lad
,
he
is
now
the
merriest
young
grazier
in
all
Northamptonshire
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
,
the
hand
that
traces
these
words
,
falters
,
as
it
approaches
the
conclusion
of
its
task
;
and
would
weave
,
for
a
little
longer
space
,
the
thread
of
these
adventures
.
   
<EOS>
I
would
fain
linger
yet
with
a
few
of
those
among
whom
I
have
so
long
moved
,
and
share
their
happiness
by
endeavouring
to
depict
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
show
Rose
Maylie
in
all
the
bloom
and
grace
of
early
womanhood
,
shedding
on
her
secluded
path
in
life
soft
and
gentle
light
,
that
fell
on
all
who
trod
it
with
her
,
and
shone
into
their
hearts
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
paint
her
the
life
and
joy
of
the
fire
-
side
circle
and
the
lively
summer
group
;
I
would
follow
her
through
the
sultry
fields
at
noon
,
and
hear
the
low
tones
of
her
sweet
voice
in
the
moonlit
evening
walk
;
I
would
watch
her
in
all
her
goodness
and
charity
abroad
,
and
the
smiling
untiring
discharge
of
domestic
duties
at
home
;
I
would
paint
her
and
her
dead
sister
's
child
happy
in
their
love
for
one
another
,
and
passing
whole
hours
together
in
picturing
the
friends
whom
they
had
so
sadly
lost
;
I
would
summon
before
me
,
once
again
,
<EOS>
those
joyous
little
faces
that
clustered
round
her
knee
,
and
listen
to
their
merry
prattle
;
I
would
recall
the
tones
of
that
clear
laugh
,
and
conjure
up
the
sympathising
tear
that
glistened
in
the
soft
blue
eye
.
 
<EOS>
These
,
and
a
thousand
looks
and
smiles
,
and
turns
<EOS>
fo
thought
and
speech
<EOS>
---
I
would
fain
recall
them
every
one
.
   
<EOS>
How
Mr
Brownlow
went
on
,
from
day
to
day
,
filling
the
mind
of
his
adopted
child
with
stores
of
knowledge
,
and
becoming
attached
to
him
,
more
and
more
,
as
his
nature
developed
itself
,
and
showed
the
thriving
seeds
of
all
he
wished
him
to
become
<EOS>
---
how
he
traced
in
him
new
traits
of
his
early
friend
,
that
awakened
in
his
own
bosom
old
remembrances
,
melancholy
and
yet
sweet
and
soothing
---
how
the
two
orphans
,
tried
by
adversity
,
remembered
its
lessons
in
mercy
to
others
,
and
mutual
love
,
and
fervent
thanks
to
Him
who
had
protected
and
preserved
them
---
these
are
all
matters
which
need
not
to
be
told
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
said
that
they
were
truly
happy
;
and
without
strong
affection
and
humanity
of
heart
,
and
gratitude
to
that
Being
whose
code
is
Mercy
,
and
whose
great
attribute
is
Benevolence
to
all
things
that
breathe
,
happiness
can
never
be
attained
.
   
<EOS>
Within
the
altar
of
the
old
village
church
there
stands
a
white
marble
tablet
,
which
bears
as
yet
<EOS>
but
one
word
:
 
"
AGNES
.
"
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
coffin
in
that
tomb
;
and
may
it
be
many
,
many
years
,
before
another
name
is
placed
above
it
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
if
the
spirits
of
the
Dead
ever
come
back
to
earth
,
to
visit
spots
hallowed
by
the
love
---
the
love
beyond
the
grave
---
of
those
whom
they
knew
in
life
,
I
believe
that
the
shade
of
Agnes
sometimes
hovers
round
that
solemn
nook
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
none
the
less
because
that
nook
is
in
a
Church
,
and
she
was
weak
and
erring
.
