THE
SIEGE
OF
<EOS>
MANCHESTERCHAPTER
IA
Presage
of
IllLATE
one
night
,
in
the
disastrous
year
1642
,
soon
after
the
commencement
of
the
Civil
War
,
as
Lord
Strange
was
alone
in
his
closet
at
Knowsley
Hall
,
reading
a
treatise
by
Cardan
<EOS>
,
blood
fell
suddenly
upon
the
book
.
<EOS>
Being
in
a
very
melancholy
frame
of
mind
at
the
time
,
he
was
powerfully
affected
by
the
occurrence
,
and
could
not
help
regarding
it
as
a
presage
of
ill
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
had
recovered
his
composure
,
he
addressed
a
prayer
to
Heaven
for
the
safety
and
welfare
of
the
king
,
and
his
own
preservation
from
sudden
and
violent
death
,
and
had
not
long
risen
from
his
knees
,
when
a
tap
at
the
door
was
heard
,
and
next
moment
,
a
grave
-
looking
person
-
age
,
whose
dress
proclaimed
him
a
divine
,
entered
the
closet
.
<EOS>
This
was
Doctor
Samuel
Rutter
,
Archdeacon
of
Man
,
and
Lord
Strange
's
domestic
chaplain
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
absent
for
some
months
,
having
duties
to
perform
in
the
Isle
of
Man
,
and
had
only
returned
on
that
very
evening
.
<EOS>
He
had
seen
his
noble
patron
on
his
arrival
at
Knowsley
Hall
,
and
thought
him
looking
very
unwell
,
but
little
passed
between
them
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
After
they
had
separated
for
the
night
,
an
unaccountable
uneasiness
came
over
him
,
and
being
unable
to
shake
off
the
feeling
,
he
repaired
to
his
lordship
's
study
,
being
aware
that
he
had
not
retired
to
rest
,
and
was
much
relieved
by
finding
him
seated
composedly
in
his
chair
.
<EOS>
"Now
<EOS>
Heaven
be
praised
that
I
find
your
lord
-
ship
well
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
much
troubled
concerning
you
,
and
could
not
seek
my
couch
till
I
had
satisfied
my
mind
that
you
had
not
been
seized
by
some
sudden
illness
.
<EOS>
"Thanking
<EOS>
him
for
his
solicitude
<EOS>
,
Lord
Strange
said
,
"
In
truth
,
I
have
not
been
well
,
but
am
now
somewhat
better
.
<EOS>
Sit
down
,
I
pray
you
,
my
good
friend
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
glad
to
have
some
converse
with
you
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
Doctor
Rutter
placed
his
taper
on
the
table
,
his
eye
fell
upon
the
blood-
stained
book
,
and
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
and
horror
.
<EOS>
"Has
<EOS>
this
just
happened
,
my
lord
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"Scarce
<EOS>
half
an
hour
ago
,
"
replied
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
Shut
the
book
,
I
pray
you
,
and
put
it
aside
.
<EOS>
"Doctor
<EOS>
Rutter
obeyed
,
and
remarked
,
as
he
sat
down:"This
portent
must
not
be
disregarded
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
Be
warned
,
I
entreat
you
.
<EOS>
Take
no
further
part
in
the
conflict
between
the
king
and
the
rebellious
Parliament
,
but
live
in
quiet
and
retirement
till
the
struggle
is
over
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
counsel
will
be
unpalatable
,
but
it
is
prompted
by
duty
to
your
lord
-
ship
.
<EOS>
After
the
spectacle
I
have
just
beheld
,
I
can
not
hold
my
tongue
.
<EOS>
Be
warned
,
I
repeat
.
<EOS>
Advance
not
on
this
path
of
danger
,
or
it
may
lead
to
your
destruction
.
<EOS>
You
may
share
the
fate
of
Strafford
.
<EOS>
""It
may
be
so
,
"
replied
Lord
Strange
;
"
but
I
shall
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
desert
the
king
at
this
juncture
,
even
if
I
were
certain
that
the
direful
consequences
you
predict
would
ensue
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
would
your
fidelity
and
devotion
were
better
appreciated
by
his
majesty
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
All
the
great
efforts
you
have
made
for
him
appear
to
have
been
counteracted
by
his
advisers
,
several
of
whom
are
evidently
inimical
to
you
.
<EOS>
""You
are
right
,
"
said
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
persuaded
the
king
that
I
am
ambitious
,
and
have
pretensions
to
the
crown
like
my
uncle
Ferdinando
,
and
they
say
I
shall
desert
him
as
my
ancestor
,
Lord
Stanley
,
deserted
,
Richard
the
Third
at
Bosworth
Field
,
when
he
gave
the
crown
to
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
the
Earl
of
Richmond
.
<EOS>
His
majesty
,
therefore
,
views
my
conduct
with
jealousy
and
suspicion
.
<EOS>
When
I
joined
him
at
York
,
I
met
with
a
cold
reception
,
but
soon
discovered
why
I
was
so
treated
,
and
strove
to
disabuse
his
mind
of
his
unjust
and
unfounded
suspicions
.
'
<EOS>
Sire
,
'
I
said
,
'
if
it
were
true
that
I
am
plotting
against
you
,
I
should
merit
death
.
<EOS>
Let
him
who
dares
charge
me
with
<EOS>
treason
stand
forth
,
and
I
will
pick
the
calumny
from
his
lips
with
the
point
of
my
sword
.
'
<EOS>
Lord
Goring
,
Lord
Digby
,
and
Lord
Jermyn
were
present
at
the
time
—
but
not
one
of
them
answered
the
challenge
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
what
said
the
king
?
"
asked
Doctor
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"He
prayed
me
to
have
patience
;
adding
,
'
this
is
not
a
time
,
when
the
rebels
are
marching
against
me
,
to
quarrel
amongst
ourselves
.
<EOS>
'""Methinks
the
rebels
themselves
must
have
seen
their
own
advantage
in
the
unworthy
treatment
thus
shown
you
,
my
lord
,
"
remarked
Rutter
,
"
and
have
sought
to
win
you
over
.
<EOS>
""You
have
guessed
right
,
"
said
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
despatch
was
shortly
afterwards
sent
me
by
Colonel
Holland
,
commander
of
the
garrison
in
Manchester
,
stating
that
he
was
aware
of
the
great
indignity
put
upon
me
by
the
king
's
evil
counsellors
,
who
were
the
enemies
of
the
nation
,
and
that
if
I
would
engage
in
the
cause
of
the
Parliament
,
I
should
have
a
command
equal
to
my
own
greatness
,
or
to
that
of
any
of
my
ancestors
.
<EOS>
My
reply
to
the
insolent
proposition
was
prompt
and
decisive
.
<EOS>
I
bade
the
messenger
tell
Colonel
Holland
,
that
when
he
heard
I
had
turned
traitor
,
I
would
listen
to
his
offers
.
<EOS>
Till
then
,
if
I
received
such
another
despatch
it
would
be
at
the
peril
of
him
who
brought
it
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
answer
was
worthy
of
you
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
chaplain
;
"
and
well
calculated
to
put
to
shame
the
king
's
advisers
.
<EOS>
Surely
,
after
this
,
his
majesty
could
entertain
no
suspicion
of
you?""An
idea
once
fixed
upon
the
king
's
mind
is
not
easily
removed
.
<EOS>
My
motives
have
been
misrepresented
throughout
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
when
I
assembled
upwards
of
sixty
thousand
efficient
men
on
the
moors
near
Bury
,
Ormskirk
,
and
Preston
,
I
was
authoritatively
forbidden
to
take
the
command
of
the
force
,
and
these
potent
auxiliaries
were
lost
to
the
king
,
because
they
would
serve
no
other
leader
but
myself
.
<EOS>
Many
of
them
went
over
to
the
rebels
.
<EOS>
Had
this
large
force
been
retained
,
and
augmented
as
it
could
have
been
,
the
king
might
have
marched
on
in
triumph
to
London
,
and
have
effectually
crushed
the
rebellion
.
<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
lamentable
,
"
remarked
Doctor
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"
But
his
majesty
's
eyes
have
been
blinded
.
<EOS>
""Though
<EOS>
deeply
hurt
by
the
treatment
I
have
experienced
,
"
pursued
Lord
Strange
,
"
I
did
not
desist
from
my
efforts
,
but
without
delay
raised
three
troops
of
horse
,
and
three
regiments
of
foot
,
which
I
armed
and
equipped
,
and
prepared
to
join
the
king
at
Warrington
,
where
it
had
been
agreed
that
the
royal
standard
should
be
reared
.
<EOS>
Once
more
the
counsels
of
my
enemies
prevailed
,
and
to
the
king
's
disadvantage
.
<EOS>
Warrington
,
where
I
am
omnipotent
,
as
I
need
not
tell
you
,
was
abandoned
,
and
Nottingham
chosen
,
where
I
have
no
influence
whatever
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
without
any
reason
assigned
for
the
step
,
I
was
deprived
of
the
lieutenancy
of
Cheshire
and
North
Wales
,
and
Lord
Rivers
was
joined
in
commission
with
me
for
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
marvel
your
lordship
could
forgive
the
affront
.
<EOS>
But
I
know
your
loyalty
is
unchangeable
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
not
cease
to
serve
the
king
faithfully
,
even
though
he
should
continue
to
requite
me
with
ingratitude
,
"
said
Lord
Strange
;
"
nor
shall
I
abate
my
zeal
,
even
though
his
cause
should
become
hopeless
.
<EOS>
I
am
now
awaiting
his
majesty
's
orders
to
attack
Manchester
.
<EOS>
I
could
easily
have
taken
the
place
two
months
ago
,
when
I
seized
upon
the
magazine
,
and
carried
off
the
powder
stored
within
it
by
Colonel
Holland
,
but
I
had
no
orders
at
the
time
,
and
might
have
been
blamed
for
precipitancy
.
<EOS>
Since
then
the
town
has
been
fortified
by
an
engineer
named
Rosworm
,
and
it
can
now
stand
a
siege
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
lordship
surprises
me
,
"
observed
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
this
Rosworm
,
of
whom
you
speak
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
heard
of
him
.
<EOS>
""A
<EOS>
very
skilful
German
engineer
,
who
has
had
plenty
of
experience
in
his
own
country
,
where
he
served
under
Wallenstein
,
"
replied
Lord
Strange
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
been
in
Ireland
,
but
on
the
outbreak
of
the
rebellion
of
the
Roman
Catholics
there
,
he
came
to
England
,
and
found
his
way
to
Manchester
,
where
he
has
been
engaged
by
Colonel
Holland
and
the
other
rebel
leaders
to
fortify
the
town
.
<EOS>
And
he
has
done
his
work
well
.
<EOS>
When
I
first
heard
of
his
arrival
I
sent
messengers
to
offer
him
double
pay
if
he
would
serve
the
king
,
but
he
refused
to
break
his
engagement
with
the
rebels
.
<EOS>
""That
speaks
well
for
his
honesty
at
all
events
,
"
remarked
Doctor
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
he
is
a
brave
fellow
,
and
very
skilful
,
as
I
have
just
said
,
"
rejoined
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Manchester
men
are
lucky
in
securing
him
.
<EOS>
That
he
will
make
a
good
defence
of
the
town
I
do
not
doubt
,
but
I
shall
take
it
nevertheless
.
<EOS>
The
difficulty
will
be
to
hold
it
when
taken
.
<EOS>
Manchester
is
the
most
important
Parliamentary
stronghold
in
the
North
of
England
,
and
every
effort
will
be
made
by
the
rebels
to
recover
it
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
since
I
have
said
so
much
,
I
will
detain
you
for
a
few
minutes
longer
while
I
explain
why
I
have
sent
for
you
from
the
Isle
of
Man
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
mean
to
enter
upon
the
matter
till
to
-
morrow
,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
I
had
better
mention
it
now
while
my
mind
is
full
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
""I
am
prepared
to
listen
to
all
you
may
tell
me
,
my
lord
,
"
observed
Doctor
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
a
word
,
then
,
"
said
Lord
Strange
,
"
since
it
is
certain
the
Civil
War
has
begun
in
Lancashire
,
and
no
one
can
tell
how
long
it
may
last
,
or
how
it
may
terminate
,
it
is
my
intention
to
garrison
Lathom
House
,
so
that
if
driven
to
extremities
,
I
can
hold
it
for
six
months
or
longer
against
an
enemy
.
<EOS>
The
house
is
as
strong
as
a
castle
,
as
you
know
—
indeed
,
few
castles
in
England
are
so
strong
-
and
from
its
position
,
size
,
fortifications
,
and
broad
deep
moat
,
I
am
confident
it
will
stand
a
lengthened
siege
,
if
provided
with
sufficient
men
,
ammunition
,
and
ordnance
.
<EOS>
I
shall
therefore
place
three
hundred
experienced
musketeers
within
the
hall
,
plant
cannon
of
large
size
on
the
walls
and
towers
,
and
provision
it
for
six
months
.
<EOS>
Should
I
be
absent
,
as
may
chance
,
its
custody
will
be
committed
to
my
noble
and
high
-
spirited
wife
,
in
whose
veins
flows
the
blood
of
the
Nassaus
,
and
whose
courage
well
fits
her
for
the
charge
.
<EOS>
""That
I
will
answer
for
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
braver
-
hearted
lady
than
Charlotte
de
la
Trémoille
,
Lady
Strange
,
does
not
exist
.
<EOS>
I
am
impatient
to
learn
whether
your
lordship
requires
me
to
take
any
part
in
the
preparations
for
the
defence
of
Lathom
House
.
<EOS>
""Thus
<EOS>
much
,
my
good
friend
,
"
replied
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
aid
her
ladyship
with
your
councils
,
and
act
for
her
as
may
be
needful
and
as
she
may
require
.
<EOS>
On
no
man
's
judgment
can
I
place
greater
reliance
than
on
yours
,
my
good
Rutter
;
and
while
you
are
at
Lathom
,
I
feel
certain
all
my
plans
will
be
fully
carried
out
.
<EOS>
Of
necessity
,
I
shall
be
often
absent
,
for
I
shall
have
much
to
do
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
,
as
you
are
aware
,
is
now
at
Lathom
,
and
will
remain
there
altogether
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
you
will
join
her
,
and
I
wish
you
fully
to
explain
my
designs
.
<EOS>
If
I
do
not
receive
the
order
I
have
been
expecting
from
his
majesty
to
attack
Manchester
,
it
is
my
intention
to
go
to
Chester
to
see
my
father
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
who
has
been
very
unwell
for
the
last
week
.
<EOS>
""His
<EOS>
lordship
,
I
trust
,
is
not
dangerously
ill
?
<EOS>
"
observed
Doctor
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
hope
not
,
"
said
Lord
Strange
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
physician
,
Doctor
Gerard
,
from
whom
I
hear
daily
,
tells
me
I
need
not
feel
anxious
about
him
,
and
that
he
is
doing
well
,
but
in
spite
of
these
assurances
,
I
am
uneasy
—
very
uneasy
—
for
he
is
old
and
feeble
,
and
might
quickly
sink
.
<EOS>
""It
is
satisfactory
to
reflect
that
the
earl
has
long
been
prepared
to
quit
this
world
,
"
observed
Rutter
,
"
and
having
relinquished
all
his
great
estates
and
power
has
nothing
to
tie
him
to
earth
.
<EOS>
""No
,
he
has
long
done
with
the
world
and
its
vanities
,
"
said
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
My
beloved
mother
's
death
was
a
severe
blow
to
him
,
and
he
has
never
recovered
from
it
.
<EOS>
I
marvel
not
at
it
,
for
a
better
wife
and
better
mother
than
Elizabeth
Vere
,
Countess
of
Derby
,
never
existed
.
<EOS>
The
earl
,
my
father
,
has
never
been
himself
since
he
lost
her
.
<EOS>
His
interest
in
life
was
gone
—
his
sole
desire
being
to
join
her
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
No
recluse
could
dwell
in
greater
retirement
than
he
has
done
,
ever
since
this
sad
bereavement
in
his
house
on
the
banks
of
the
Dee
near
Chester
.
<EOS>
But
his
sorrows
seem
now
drawing
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
""Where
grief
is
incurable
,
the
grave
appears
the
only
refuge
,
"
said
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"
Under
such
circumstances
prolongation
of
life
is
scarcely
to
be
desired
.
<EOS>
""True
,
"
said
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
must
await
the
fatal
stroke
without
impatience
,
and
my
father
,
amid
all
his
sufferings
,
has
been
perfectly
resigned
to
the
will
of
Heaven
.
<EOS>
His
motive
for
surrendering
his
estates
to
me
during
his
lifetime
was
that
he
might
pass
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
solitude
and
prayer
.
<EOS>
He
then
firmly
believed
that
his
life
would
not
be
long
,
and
though
he
was
mistaken
,
he
has
never
regretted
the
step
.
<EOS>
Had
he
done
so
<EOS>
,
I
would
have
restored
everything
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
formed
a
resolution
,
like
that
of
the
Emperor
Charles
the
Fifth
,
when
he
chose
a
retreat
in
the
monastery
of
Saint
Just
,
and
entirely
renounced
the
world
,
its
business
,
pleasures
,
and
troubles
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
he
did
not
,
like
Charles
the
Fifth
,
practise
all
the
rigours
of
a
monastic
life
,
"
observed
Doctor
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"He
has
performed
no
act
of
penance
,
for
that
is
no
part
of
his
faith
,
"
replied
Lord
Strange
;
"
but
he
has
spent
much
of
his
time
in
religious
meditation
and
prayer
.
<EOS>
I
would
I
were
as
well
prepared
for
eternity
as
my
father
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
lordship
has
not
much
cause
for
self
-
reproach
,
"
said
Doctor
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"I
strive
to
do
right
,
but
I
often
fall
short
in
my
endeavours
,
"
replied
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
that
some
day
I
shall
retire
altogether
from
the
world
like
my
father
.
<EOS>
""That
day
,
I
hope
,
is
far
distant
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Doctor
Rutter
.
<EOS>
Just
then
footsteps
were
heard
in
the
adjoining
gallery
,
and
immediately
afterwards
a
serving
-
man
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
"What
wouldst
thou
,
Cuthbert
?
"
demanded
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"An
<EOS>
it
please
your
lordship
,
"
replied
the
servant
,
"
a
messenger
has
just
arrived
from
Chester
—
from
the
Earl
of
Derby
.
<EOS>
""A
messenger
from
the
earl
,
my
father
—
at
this
hour
!
"
exclaimed
Lord
Strange
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"
What
news
brings
he?""I
can
not
say
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
man
.
"
<EOS>
He
did
not
deliver
his
message
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
fear
he
does
not
bring
good
news
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
alarm
me
,
Cuthbert
,
"
cried
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
is
the
messenger?""Without
—
in
the
gallery
,
my
lord
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
Captain
Standish
.
<EOS>
""Captain
<EOS>
Standish
!
<EOS>
Bid
him
come
in
at
once
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
order
was
obeyed
,
and
next
moment
a
tall
and
remarkably
handsome
young
man
,
about
two
or
three
and
twenty
,
was
ushered
into
the
closet
.
<EOS>
The
new
-
comer
wore
a
buff
coat
embroidered
with
lace
,
a
short
cloak
,
funnel-
topped
boots
of
supple
leather
ascending
above
the
knee
,
and
carried
in
his
hand
a
broad
-
leaved
Flemish
beaver
hat
,
adorned
with
a
rich
band
and
a
plume
of
feathers
.
<EOS>
The
long
dark
locks
falling
upon
his
shoulders
at
once
proclaimed
him
a
Cavalier
—
the
Puritans
being
already
distinguished
by
their
closely
cropped
hair
.
<EOS>
His
manner
and
looks
were
highly
prepossessing
.
<EOS>
Though
he
had
ridden
far
and
fast
,
he
did
not
seem
fatigued
by
the
journey
.
<EOS>
On
the
entrance
of
Captain
Standish
,
Lord
Strange
rose
to
greet
him
,
and
looking
inquiringly
into
his
face
,
said:"Keep
me
not
in
suspense
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
How
is
the
earl
,
my
father
?
<EOS>
Does
he
still
live?""He
<EOS>
does
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Captain
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
,
he
was
alive
when
I
left
him
some
three
hours
ago
,
and
Doctor
Gerard
assured
me
that
he
is
in
no
immediate
danger
,
though
he
can
not
last
long
.
<EOS>
""Did
<EOS>
you
see
him
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Lord
Strange
,
eagerly
and
anxiously
.
<EOS>
"
How
looked
he
?
<EOS>
Was
he
sensible?""Perfectly
sensible
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Standish
.
"
<EOS>
His
sole
desire
seemed
to
be
to
behold
your
lord
-
ship
once
more
ere
he
died
,
and
bid
you
a
last
farewell
.
<EOS>
I
offered
to
set
off
forthwith
and
convey
his
dying
wishes
to
your
lordship
,
and
he
thanked
me
much
,
but
added
,
'
If
my
son
has
aught
to
do
for
the
king
that
demands
his
presence
,
bid
him
not
mind
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
will
come
if
he
can
.
<EOS>
Should
aught
hinder
him
,
or
should
he
not
arrive
in
the
time
,
I
shall
die
content
.
<EOS>
'""Heaven
<EOS>
grant
<EOS>
I
may
not
be
too
late
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
start
as
soon
as
horses
can
be
got
ready
.
<EOS>
You
have
done
me
a
great
service
,
Frank
,
and
I
shall
not
forget
it
.
<EOS>
While
you
refresh
yourself
after
your
ride
,
a
bed
shall
be
got
ready
for
you
.
<EOS>
""I
will
drink
a
cup
of
wine
in
the
hall
,
and
snatch
a
mouthful
of
food
,
"
replied
Standish
;
"
but
if
your
lordship
will
furnish
me
with
a
fresh
horse
,
for
mine
is
somewhat
jaded
,
I
will
go
back
with
you
to
Chester
.
<EOS>
""You
had
best
go
to
bed
,
"
said
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
done
work
enough
for
to-
night
.
<EOS>
""I
pray
your
lordship
to
let
me
have
my
way
,
"
said
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
feel
that
I
have
fulfilled
my
promise
to
the
earl
,
your
father
,
unless
I
bring
you
back
to
him
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
have
done
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
could
ride
thirty
more
miles
before
day
-
break
,
and
not
be
the
worse
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
only
require
a
fresh
horse
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
that
you
shall
have
,
"
said
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
Since
you
are
bent
upon
going
with
me
,
I
will
not
hinder
you
.
<EOS>
Hark
,
thee
,
Cuthbert
<EOS>
,
"
he
added
to
the
man-
servant
,
who
remained
in
the
closet
waiting
his
noble
master
's
orders
;
"
let
refreshments
be
got
ready
instantly
by
some
of
thy
fellows
for
Captain
Standish
,
and
while
this
is
being
done
,
go
to
the
stables
,
and
cause
my
best
hunter
to
be
saddled
for
me
.
<EOS>
Another
strong
horse
will
be
required
for
Captain
Standish
.
<EOS>
Two
grooms
will
go
with
me
,
and
half
a
dozen
armed
attendants
.
<EOS>
And
mark
me
well!—the
utmost
expedition
must
be
used
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
less
than
quarter
of
the
hour
the
horses
shall
be
at
the
hall
-
door
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Cuthbert
,
preparing
to
depart
.
<EOS>
"Go
<EOS>
with
him
,
Frank
,
"
said
Lord
Strange
,
"
and
make
the
best
supper
you
can
.
<EOS>
I
will
join
you
in
the
dining
-
hall
anon
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
as
Captain
Standish
quitted
the
closet
,
his
lordship
turned
to
the
archdeacon
,
who
had
listened
to
the
foregoing
discourse
in
silence
.
<EOS>
"Only
<EOS>
a
few
minutes
ago
we
were
talking
of
my
father
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
little
thought
that
I
should
so
soon
receive
this
sad
intelligence
respecting
him
.
<EOS>
Yet
it
does
not
surprise
me
,
for
I
have
long
been
expecting
the
summons
.
<EOS>
I
must
now
prepare
for
my
departure
;
but
before
doing
so
,
I
will
write
a
brief
letter
to
Lady
Strange
,
which
you
will
deliver
to
her
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
The
news
will
afflict
her
much
,
for
she
loved
my
father
tenderly
.
<EOS>
""I
will
offer
her
all
the
consolation
in
my
power
,
"
said
Doctor
Rutter
.
<EOS>
And
adding
that
he
would
await
his
lordship
in
the
hall
,
he
quitted
the
closet
.
<EOS>
Left
alone
,
Lord
Strange
fastened
the
door
that
he
might
not
be
interrupted
,
and
then
knelt
down
and
prayed
fervently
for
his
dying
father
,
imploring
Heaven
that
he
might
be
permitted
to
see
him
again
while
life
remained
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IILord
StrangeTHIS
supplication
made
,
Lord
Strange
arose
,
and
wrote
a
few
lines
full
of
tenderness
and
affection
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Having
sealed
the
letter
,
he
proceeded
to
his
dressing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Hastily
exchanging
his
loose
gown
for
a
black
velvet
doublet
embroidered
with
silver
and
pantoufles
for
riding
-
boots
,
he
slipped
a
rich
baldrick
over
his
right
shoulder
,
while
his
sword
,
his
black
plumed
hat
,
and
gloves
were
brought
him
by
a
valet
who
was
in
attendance
.
<EOS>
Thus
attired
,
he
presented
a
noble
figure
.
<EOS>
Lord
Strange
was
then
in
the
full
perfection
of
manhood
,
being
in
his
thirty-
eighth
year
.
<EOS>
Though
not
above
the
middle
height
,
he
possessed
a
strong
and
well-
proportioned
frame
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
handsome
,
the
nose
prominent
but
well
formed
,
and
the
eyes
large
and
black
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
was
dark
,
and
the
habitual
expression
of
his
countenance
grave
and
somewhat
melancholy
.
<EOS>
A
face
full
of
intelligence
and
power
.
<EOS>
One
peculiarity
must
be
noticed
,
as
shown
in
Vandyke
's
fine
portrait
.
<EOS>
The
brow
was
almost
hidden
by
the
dark
hair
brought
over
it
;
but
,
perhaps
,
the
arrangement
suited
the
physiognomy
.
<EOS>
Certainly
the
long
dark
locks
falling
upon
the
shoulders
became
the
wearer
well
.
<EOS>
Lord
Strange
had
a
proud
and
martial
bearing
.
<EOS>
Trained
as
a
soldier
,
he
was
well
qualified
for
a
command
.
<EOS>
What
he
lacked
was
experience
,
since
he
had
not
yet
served
in
a
regular
campaign
.
<EOS>
Brave
,
yet
not
rash
,
he
was
somewhat
fiery
,
but
generous
and
chivalrous
.
<EOS>
As
already
intimated
,
he
carried
devotion
to
the
king
to
its
utmost
extent
.
<EOS>
Though
studious
,
Lord
Strange
was
exceedingly
active
and
fond
of
all
manly
sports
—
hunting
and
hawking
<EOS>
were
his
delight
.
<EOS>
Ordinarily
his
manner
was
haughty
and
reserved
,
but
towards
his
dependents
and
retainers
he
was
very
affable
.
<EOS>
So
popular
was
he
with
the
common
folk
,
that
they
were
wo
nt
to
say
of
him
in
after
days
,
as
had
been
said
of
his
fathers
before
him
,
"
God
bless
the
King
and
the
Earl
of
Derby!"James
Stanley
,
Lord
Strange
,
eldest
son
of
William
,
sixth
Earl
of
Derby
,
who
was
great
-
grandson
of
Mary
,
daughter
of
Henry
the
Seventh
,
claimed
kindred
with
the
Lancasters
,
Plantagenets
,
Tudors
and
Stuarts
,
and
it
was
his
royal
descent
,
vast
possessions
,
and
great
territorial
influence
that
had
excited
the
jealousy
of
Charles
the
First
—
a
jealousy
,
kept
alive
and
heightened
by
that
monarch
's
ill
-
chosen
favourites
and
councillors
,
most
of
whom
were
hostile
to
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
When
a
very
young
man
,
being
on
his
travels
,
Lord
Strange
visited
the
Hague
,
where
Elizabeth
,
Queen
of
Bohemia
,
daughter
of
James
the
First
,
held
her
court
,
and
he
then
first
beheld
his
destined
bride
,
the
beautiful
and
accomplished
Charlotte
de
la
Trémoille
,
whose
family
was
as
illustrious
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
Daughter
of
Claude
Duke
de
Thouars
,
by
Charlotte
Brabantine
de
Nassau
,
daughter
of
William
Prince
of
Orange
,
Charlotte
de
la
Trémoille
was
likewise
grand
-
daughter
of
Charlotte
de
Bourbon
,
of
the
royal
house
of
Montpensier
,
and
was
therefore
in
every
respect
a
suitable
match
for
the
heir
of
the
great
house
of
Stanley
.
<EOS>
The
nuptial
ceremony
,
conducted
with
great
magnificence
,
took
place
in
a
palace
of
the
Prince
of
Orange
at
the
Hague
,
in
the
presence
of
the
King
and
Queen
of
Bohemia
and
other
royal
and
noble
personages
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
the
young
lord
brought
his
lovely
bride
to
London
,
and
she
appeared
as
one
of
the
chief
ornaments
of
the
court
of
Queen
Henrietta
Maria
.
<EOS>
At
this
time
,
Lord
Strange
lived
with
great
splendour
—
his
father
,
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
disconsolate
at
the
loss
of
his
wife
,
having
surrendered
his
estates
to
him
—
gave
sumptuous
entertainments
,
and
became
a
patron
of
artists
,
men
of
science
and
letters
.
<EOS>
Vandyke
,
whom
he
had
known
in
Holland
,
received
most
flattering
attention
from
him
.
<EOS>
But
the
king
looked
coldly
upon
the
powerful
noble
,
and
unable
to
brook
this
treatment
,
Lord
Strange
retired
to
his
seats
in
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
Lady
Strange
,
who
was
devotedly
attached
to
her
lord
,
and
whose
good
sense
equalled
her
personal
attractions
,
expressed
no
regret
at
quitting
the
court
,
though
she
stood
very
high
in
the
queen
's
favour
,
and
was
greatly
admired
for
her
beauty
and
wit
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
found
herself
a
person
of
far
more
importance
at
Lathom
House
and
Knowsley
,
than
she
had
been
at
Whitehall
,
and
at
Castle
Rushen
,
in
the
Isle
of
Man
,
of
which
her
husband
was
supreme
lord
,
she
was
a
queen
.
<EOS>
Both
at
Lathom
House
and
Knowsley
,
Lord
Strange
kept
up
princely
establishments
,
and
revived
the
magnificent
doings
of
his
ancestor
,
Edward
,
the
third
Earl
of
Derby
,
of
whom
it
was
said
by
Camden
,
"
that
with
his
death
,
the
glory
of
hospitality
seemed
to
fall
asleep
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
almost
regal
mode
of
life
,
which
was
represented
as
a
sort
of
rivalry
,
greatly
offended
the
king
.
<EOS>
Completely
neglected
by
the
Court
,
but
still
practising
the
extraordinary
hospitality
just
described
,
Lord
Strange
continued
to
reside
in
Lancashire
,
or
at
his
castle
in
the
Isle
of
Man
,
for
several
years
,
during
which
his
power
and
influence
underwent
no
diminution
,
but
rather
increased
.
<EOS>
Unquestionably
,
he
was
the
most
powerful
nobleman
in
the
North
of
England
at
the
outbreak
of
the
Civil
War
.
<EOS>
Banishing
all
thought
of
the
treatment
he
had
experienced
,
he
listened
only
to
the
dictates
of
loyalty
and
devotion
,
by
which
his
breast
had
been
ever
animated
,
and
at
once
offered
his
services
to
the
king
.
<EOS>
How
his
motives
were
misconstrued
,
and
his
efforts
paralysed
,
has
been
shown
.
<EOS>
As
Lord
Strange
marched
along
the
great
gallery
,
preceded
by
a
servant
bearing
a
light
,
his
eye
fell
upon
the
portraits
of
his
ancestors
lining
the
walls
.
<EOS>
There
was
Thomas
Lord
Stanley
,
first
Earl
of
Derby
,
who
married
the
widow
of
the
Earl
of
Richmond
,
and
mother
of
Henry
the
Seventh
;
Thomas
,
grandson
of
the
first
earl
,
and
perhaps
the
most
distinguished
of
the
illustrious
line
;
Edward
,
third
earl
,
lord
high
steward
at
the
coronation
of
Mary
,
and
chamberlain
of
Chester
in
Elizabeth
's
time
,
who
married
a
daughter
of
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
;
Henry
,
fourth
earl
,
who
espoused
the
granddaughter
of
Charles
Brandon
,
Duke
of
Suffolk
,
and
Mary
,
widow
of
Louis
the
Twelfth
of
France
,
and
Sister
to
Henry
the
Eighth
;
Ferdinando
,
fifth
earl
,
said
to
be
poisoned
by
the
Jesuits
;
and
,
lastly
,
William
,
sixth
earl
,
who
succeeded
his
brother
Ferdinando
,
and
had
married
Elizabeth
de
Vere
,
daughter
of
the
Earl
of
Oxford
.
<EOS>
Lord
Strange
paused
for
a
moment
before
the
portrait
of
his
sire
,
a
stately-
looking
personage
in
the
costume
of
Elizabeth
's
time
,
and
wearing
the
order
of
the
Garter
.
<EOS>
Well
-
nigh
half
a
century
had
elapsed
since
that
portrait
was
painted
,
and
the
earl
was
young
and
handsome
then
.
<EOS>
How
looked
he
now
?
<EOS>
Lord
Strange
could
not
help
asking
himself
the
question
.
<EOS>
Beside
Earl
William
was
his
countess
,
whose
marvellous
beauty
explained
his
incurable
grief
at
her
loss
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
fancy
—
<EOS>
nay
,
it
must
have
<EOS>
been!—but
<EOS>
as
Lord
Strange
contemplated
these
portraits
,
they
seemed
to
gaze
mournfully
at
him
,
and
to
follow
him
with
their
looks
as
he
went
on
.
<EOS>
Descending
the
great
oak
staircase
,
he
reached
the
hall
,
where
he
found
Archdeacon
Rutter
,
and
gave
him
the
letter
for
Lady
Strange
,
charging
him
with
some
further
affectionate
messages
to
her
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
Captain
Standish
had
finished
his
hasty
repast
,
and
was
quite
ready
to
attend
upon
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
In
another
part
of
the
hall
,
and
not
far
from
the
entrance
,
stood
the
porter
,
with
some
half
-
dozen
serving
-
men
in
rich
liveries
,
and
they
now
threw
open
the
great
door
.
<EOS>
But
Lord
Strange
could
not
depart
without
a
word
to
old
Randal
Fermor
,
the
steward
,
who
had
risen
from
his
couch
to
receive
his
lordship
's
parting
commands
.
<EOS>
The
old
man
now
approached
.
<EOS>
Having
filled
the
same
office
in
the
time
of
Earl
Ferdinando
,
he
had
been
continued
in
it
ever
since
.
<EOS>
He
was
greatly
attached
to
Earl
William
,
and
the
tidings
just
received
of
his
lordship
's
critical
condition
had
greatly
grieved
him
.
<EOS>
As
he
drew
near
,
he
said
to
Lord
<EOS>
Strange:"Had
<EOS>
I
been
able
to
ride
so
far
,
I
would
have
prayed
your
lordship
to
allow
me
to
accompany
you
to
Chester
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
have
seen
my
old
master
<EOS>
once
more
ere
he
goes
hence
.
<EOS>
""Willingly
<EOS>
would
I
have
granted
thy
request
,
Randal
,
hadst
thou
been
equal
to
the
journey
,
"
said
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
mention
thy
wish
to
my
father
,
should
he
be
living
when
I
arrive
.
<EOS>
He
had
ever
a
great
regard
for
thee
.
<EOS>
""I
know
it
—
I
feel
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
old
steward
,
scarcely
able
to
repress
his
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
one
whom
I
loved
and
honoured
so
much
as
my
old
master
—
your
lordship
excepted
.
<EOS>
May
he
meet
his
reward
in
heaven
,
and
his
portion
be
with
the
blessed
!
<EOS>
He
was
the
kindest
and
best
of
men
,
as
well
as
the
most
noble
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
""Thou
<EOS>
say'st
<EOS>
truly
,
Randal
,
"
observed
Lord
Strange
,
much
moved
.
<EOS>
"
Nor
can
we
rightly
estimate
his
loss
.
<EOS>
But
we
are
speaking
of
him
as
if
he
was
gone
—
whereas
,
it
may
please
the
Almighty
to
spare
him
yet
awhile
.
<EOS>
""He
is
too
good
for
this
wicked
world
,
my
lord
,
"
cried
old
Randal
,
fairly
bursting
into
tears
,
"
and
is
better
out
of
it!""At
any
rate
,
he
is
well
prepared
for
his
departure
,
"
said
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
And
now
fare
thee
well
!
<EOS>
I
commit
all
to
thy
charge
during
my
absence
,
and
I
do
so
with
perfect
confidence
,
for
thou
hast
ever
been
a
faithful
steward
to
me
and
mine
.
<EOS>
He
who
is
going
will
bear
witness
for
thee
above!"The
old
steward
pressed
his
lips
to
the
hand
extended
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
servants
formed
themselves
into
two
lines
as
Lord
Strange
went
forth
followed
by
Captain
Standish
.
<EOS>
A
powerful
steed
,
held
by
a
groom
,
was
standing
close
by
the
steps
,
and
his
lordship
had
no
sooner
mounted
than
another
horse
was
brought
for
Standish
.
<EOS>
A
bright
moonlight
night
.
<EOS>
Where
the
beams
fell
every
object
could
be
clearly
discerned
.
<EOS>
A
large
portion
of
the
courtyard
,
however
,
buried
in
shade
.
<EOS>
Still
,
the
picturesque
outline
of
the
mansion
,
with
its
gables
and
large
bay
windows
,
was
fully
revealed
.
<EOS>
The
armed
escort
was
in
attendance
,
and
at
the
head
of
this
little
troop
Lord
Strange
rode
out
of
the
court
-
yard
,
and
proceeded
towards
the
park
,
through
which
he
meant
to
shape
his
course
.
<EOS>
On
this
side
the
palatial
mansion
was
seen
to
the
greatest
advantage
,
and
it
could
not
have
looked
better
than
it
did
on
that
lovely
night
.
<EOS>
So
exquisite
was
the
scene
,
that
it
extorted
Frank
Standish
's
admiration
.
<EOS>
Knowsley
Hall
was
then
a
large
irregular
pile
,
additions
to
the
original
structure
having
been
made
at
various
times
,
but
its
very
irregularity
gave
it
a
charm
.
<EOS>
Open
at
the
front
,
it
had
two
large
wings
,
and
at
the
rear
beyond
the
inner
court
were
extensive
out
-
buildings
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
of
the
main
building
was
a
chapel
,
that
might
almost
be
described
as
a
church
,
since
it
was
very
lofty
,
and
had
large
windows
filled
with
the
richest
stained
glass
.
<EOS>
On
this
side
were
the
gardens
laid
out
in
the
old
-
fashioned
style
,
with
terraces
—
each
terrace
being
bordered
by
a
row
of
clipped
yew-
trees
—
very
formal
,
but
very
beautiful
.
<EOS>
At
the
foot
of
these
slopes
was
a
large
sheet
of
water
—
almost
a
lake
—
that
materially
added
to
the
beauty
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
Beyond
was
the
park
—
then
full
of
magnificent
old
timber
,
the
growth
of
centuries
,
and
abounding
in
deer
.
<EOS>
The
turrets
and
walls
of
the
ancient
mansion
were
now
bathed
in
moonlight
,
and
the
surface
of
the
miniature
lake
glittered
in
the
silvery
beams
.
<EOS>
Lord
Strange
had
just
entered
the
park
,
and
was
about
to
quicken
his
pace
,
when
a
groom
,
who
had
ridden
on
in
advance
,
came
back
to
say
that
a
party
of
horsemen
was
approaching
;
and
in
another
minute
the
little
troop
came
in
sight
.
<EOS>
It
consisted
of
a
small
detachment
of
dragoons
,
with
an
officer
at
their
head
,
<EOS>
whose
splendid
accoutrements
showed
he
belonged
to
the
royal
guard
.
<EOS>
As
he
drew
nearer
,
Lord
Strange
recognised
him
as
Captain
Galliard
,
with
whom
he
was
well
acquainted
,
and
halted
to
greet
him
.
"
<EOS>
Your
lordship
is
fortunately
encountered
,
"
said
Captain
Galliard
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
coming
to
Knowsley
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
despatch
for
you
from
his
majesty
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
with
these
words
he
presented
a
letter
to
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"Can
<EOS>
you
tell
me
the
purport
of
his
missive
,
colonel
?
"
demanded
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
can
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Galliard
;
"
and
I
might
have
delivered
the
message
verbally
,
but
his
majesty
deemed
it
more
fitting
to
write
.
<EOS>
Your
lordship
is
commanded
to
attend
the
king
without
delay
at
Nottingham
Castle
.
<EOS>
""I
would
instantly
obey
the
command
,
colonel
,
"
said
Lord
Strange
;
"
but
I
have
just
received
another
summons
,
that
can
not
be
neglected
.
<EOS>
""How
,
my
lord
!
"
exclaimed
Galliard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
king
's
commands
are
paramount
to
all
other
—
or
should
be
so
.
<EOS>
""I
am
ready
at
all
times
to
sacrifice
life
and
fortune
for
the
king
,
but
there
are
appeals
to
which
even
his
majesty
's
commands
must
give
way
.
<EOS>
Such
is
mine
,
as
you
yourself
,
I
am
sure
,
will
admit
,
when
I
tell
you
I
have
just
been
summoned
to
my
father
's
death
-
bed
.
<EOS>
""I
have
just
arrived
from
Chester
,
colonel
,
"
interposed
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Derby
will
scarce
depart
in
peace
unless
he
beholds
his
son
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
more
need
be
said
,
"
remarked
Captain
Galliard
,
feelingly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
report
what
I
have
heard
to
the
king
.
<EOS>
His
majesty
,
I
am
certain
,
will
deeply
sympathise
with
your
lordship
.
<EOS>
""I
will
join
him
at
Nottingham
as
soon
as
I
can
,
"
said
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Having
rendered
this
explanation
I
must
now
press
on
to
Chester
,
or
I
may
arrive
too
late
.
<EOS>
Proceed
to
Knowsley
,
I
pray
you
,
colonel
,
and
take
a
few
hours
'
rest
after
your
long
journey
.
<EOS>
My
steward
will
see
to
all
your
wants
.
<EOS>
""I
will
take
advantage
of
your
lordship
's
offer
,
"
said
Captain
Galliard
.
<EOS>
"
In
good
truth
,
we
all
—
men
and
horses
—
need
rest
and
refreshment
.
<EOS>
""Farewell
,
then
,
"
said
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
we
may
meet
again
under
happier
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
galloped
off
,
followed
by
Captain
Standish
and
his
attendants
,
while
Captain
Galliard
and
his
men
proceeded
to
Knowsley
Hall
,
where
they
were
very
hospitably
received
by
old
Randal
Fermor
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
IIIThe
Dying
EarlPASSING
through
Prescot
,
and
crossing
the
old
bridge
over
the
Mersey
at
Warrington
,
built
by
the
first
Earl
of
Derby
,
Lord
Strange
and
his
attendants
rode
on
at
a
rapid
pace
through
Daresbury
to
Frodsham
,
where
they
roused
the
host
of
the
Bear
's
Paw
,
and
halted
for
a
few
minutes
to
refresh
their
steeds
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
they
galloped
off
again
,
and
skirting
the
wide
marshes
between
them
and
the
Mersey
,
kept
as
near
as
they
could
to
a
range
of
lofty
hills
;
then
tracking
the
boundaries
of
Delamere
Forest
,
they
speeded
on
through
Plemston
and
Mickle
Trafford
.
<EOS>
Day
was
just
breaking
as
they
approached
Chester
,
and
the
castle
and
cathedral
,
with
some
of
the
loftier
buildings
,
could
be
seen
overtopping
the
walls
of
the
ancient
and
picturesque
city
.
<EOS>
Shut
and
guarded
during
the
night
,
the
gates
were
not
opened
at
that
early
hour
,
but
it
was
not
Lord
Strange
's
intention
to
enter
the
city
.
<EOS>
Turning
off
on
the
right
,
he
crossed
the
Roodee
,
where
for
upwards
of
a
century
races
had
been
run
,
and
jousts
and
other
chivalrous
sports
held
,
and
rode
on
till
he
came
to
a
large
mansion
,
situated
on
the
banks
of
the
river
Dee
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
the
earl
,
my
father
,
still
alive
,
Hyde
?
"
cried
Lord
Strange
to
the
porter
,
who
came
forth
to
meet
him
,
as
he
rode
up
to
the
gateway
.
<EOS>
"He
is
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Hyde
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
fear
he
is
rapidly
sinking
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
be
thanked
I
am
in
time
,
"
exclaimed
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
And
,
springing
from
his
horse
,
he
entered
the
house
.
<EOS>
Few
of
the
household
had
retired
to
rest
on
that
night
,
and
Lord
Strange
found
Warburton
,
the
butler
,
and
three
or
four
other
servants
,
collected
in
the
hall
,
expecting
his
arrival
.
<EOS>
Warburton
gave
the
same
report
of
the
earl
's
condition
that
Hyde
,
the
porter
,
had
done
,
stating
that
he
had
just
been
in
his
lordship
's
room
with
some
chicken
broth
,
but
he
would
not
touch
it
.
<EOS>
"Doctor
<EOS>
Gerard
,
the
physician
,
and
Mr.
Hargrave
,
the
chaplain
,
are
now
with
him
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
butler
;
"
and
I
could
tell
what
they
thought
by
their
looks
.
<EOS>
""Take
me
at
once
to
the
chamber
,
Warburton
,
"
said
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
In
a
large
carved
oak
bedstead
,
with
heavy
hangings
,
propped
up
by
pillows
,
lay
the
dying
earl
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
still
retained
its
noble
outline
,
but
the
features
were
thin
and
sharpened
and
of
a
deathly
hue
.
<EOS>
His
hands
were
clasped
upon
his
breast
,
his
eyes
turned
upwards
,
and
he
was
evidently
repeating
a
prayer
,
which
Mr.
Hargrave
,
the
chaplain
,
an
elderly
man
,
seated
near
the
bedside
,
was
reading
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
tapers
that
had
been
burning
throughout
the
night
had
only
just
been
extinguished
,
and
the
window
curtains
drawn
back
,
so
as
to
admit
the
light
of
day
,
but
the
early
sunbeams
that
fell
upon
the
arras
and
oak
panels
gave
no
cheerfulness
to
the
room
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
they
made
the
picture
even
more
painful
by
force
of
contrast
.
<EOS>
In
a
large
easy
-
chair
sat
Doctor
Gerard
,
apparently
dozing
,
but
ever
and
anon
he
opened
his
eyes
to
look
towards
the
bed
.
<EOS>
The
entrance
of
Lord
Strange
was
so
quiet
that
it
did
not
attract
the
earl
's
notice
,
and
he
remained
for
some
moments
gazing
at
his
father
.
<EOS>
During
this
interval
,
Doctor
Gerard
,
receiving
a
sign
to
that
effect
,
did
not
quit
his
seat
,
and
Mr.
Hargrave
went
on
with
the
prayer
.
<EOS>
At
length
Lord
Strange
advanced
towards
the
bed
,
and
taking
the
earl
's
hand
said:"Father
,
I
am
here
.
<EOS>
"Something
<EOS>
like
a
smile
lighted
up
the
dying
nobleman
's
pallid
countenance
.
<EOS>
"I
knew
you
would
come
,
my
son
,
"
he
murmured
.
<EOS>
"Shall
<EOS>
we
leave
the
room
,
my
lord
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
chaplain
,
addressing
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
earl
has
something
to
say
to
you
in
private
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
pray
you
do
so
,
good
Master
Hargrave
,
"
said
,
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
But
remain
without
with
Doctor
Gerard
,
"
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
.
<EOS>
The
chaplain
bowed
and
went
out
with
the
physician
.
<EOS>
"We
are
alone
,
father
,
"
said
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"Come
<EOS>
as
near
to
me
as
you
can
,
or
you
will
not
hear
my
words
,
"
said
the
earl
,
placing
his
arm
over
his
son
's
neck
,
and
regarding
him
with
a
loving
and
pitying
look
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
much
troubled
in
mind
concerning
you
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
that
I
can
look
into
the
future
,
and
I
have
a
sad
foreboding
that
all
your
possessions
will
be
taken
from
you
,
and
that
a
tragical
death
awaits
you
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
not
that
trouble
you
,
father
,
"
said
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
If
such
is
my
destiny
,
it
can
not
be
avoided
.
<EOS>
I
trust
I
shall
be
able
to
meet
death
firmly
in
whatever
shape
<EOS>
it
may
come
.
<EOS>
Be
sure
I
shall
never
die
dishonoured
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
why
pursue
a
course
that
appears
certain
to
lead
to
this
end
,
my
son
?
<EOS>
Why
sacrifice
yourself
for
a
king
who
rewards
you
with
ingratitude
?
<EOS>
Retire
to
the
Isle
of
Man
,
where
you
can
dwell
securely
till
this
struggle
is
over
.
<EOS>
By
taking
a
prominent
part
in
it
,
you
will
gain
nothing
,
and
may
lose
all
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
follow
your
counsel
,
father
,
"
replied
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
Be
the
consequences
<EOS>
what
they
may
,
I
will
not
desert
the
king
.
<EOS>
I
should
tarnish
my
name
<EOS>
were
I
to
withdraw
from
him
now
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
so
,
my
son
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
The
course
I
point
out
is
the
only
one
left
you
.
<EOS>
The
king
trusts
you
not
,
but
listens
to
your
enemies
,
and
will
never
believe
in
your
professions
of
loyalty
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
in
vain
,
therefore
,
that
you
attempt
to
serve
him
.
<EOS>
You
have
nothing
but
mortification
and
disappointment
to
expect
.
<EOS>
Why
throw
away
life
for
one
who
treats
you
thus
?
<EOS>
Fight
not
against
him
,
but
fight
not
for
him
.
<EOS>
""I
can
make
no
promise
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
His
majesty
has
just
sent
for
me
,
and
what
he
commands
I
shall
do
.
<EOS>
""Make
<EOS>
any
excuses
rather
than
go
to
him
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
disobey
my
dying
injunctions!""I
ought
to
be
with
his
majesty
now
,
my
lord
—
but
I
am
here
,
"
replied
Lord
Strange
,
somewhat
evasively
.
<EOS>
"Remain
<EOS>
here
,
I
charge
you
,
my
son
—
at
least
for
some
days
after
my
death
,
"
said
the
earl
,
solemnly
and
authoritatively
.
<EOS>
"Ask
<EOS>
me
<EOS>
not
more
than
I
am
able
to
perform
,
father
,
"
rejoined
Lord
Strange
,
evidently
a
prey
to
conflicting
emotions
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Enjoin
aught
I
can
do
,
and
your
wishes
shall
be
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
wishes
have
been
expressed
,
"
said
the
earl
,
somewhat
reproachfully
;
"
and
since
you
refuse
to
comply
with
them
,
there
is
no
need
of
further
speech
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
you
could
see
into
the
future
as
plainly
as
I
can!""If
<EOS>
I
have
offended
you
,
father
<EOS>
,
I
humbly
crave
your
pardon
,
"
said
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"Nay
,
I
have
nothing
to
pardon
,
my
dear
son
,
"
said
the
dying
nobleman
.
<EOS>
"
My
sole
desire
is
to
preserve
you
from
danger
.
<EOS>
Take
my
blessing
.
<EOS>
Say
farewell
for
me
to
your
wife
and
children
.
<EOS>
Fain
<EOS>
would
I
have
seen
them
once
more
—
but
it
may
not
be
!
<EOS>
We
shall
all
meet
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
"While
<EOS>
he
uttered
these
words
,
a
change
came
over
the
earl
's
countenance
that
could
not
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
He
sank
back
upon
the
pillow
and
immediately
expired
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
had
elapsed
,
when
the
door
was
opened
,
and
those
outside
were
invited
to
enter
the
chamber
of
death
.
<EOS>
With
the
chaplain
and
physician
were
Frank
Standish
and
Warburton
,
the
butler
.
<EOS>
None
were
surprised
to
find
that
all
was
over
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
me
be
first
to
salute
your
lordship
as
Earl
of
Derby
,
"
said
Standish
,
bowing
deeply
as
he
came
in
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
not
desire
the
title
in
this
presence
,
"
rejoined
the
new
earl
.
"
<EOS>
Approach
the
bed
,
I
pray
you
,
good
Master
Hargrave
,
and
you
will
see
how
calm
my
father
looks
.
<EOS>
He
might
be
in
a
placid
slumber
.
<EOS>
""He
has
died
the
death
of
the
righteous
,
"
said
the
chaplain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
life
has
been
a
long
preparation
for
the
final
hour
,
and
it
has
found
him
prepared
.
<EOS>
"Bending
<EOS>
down
he
took
the
hand
of
the
departed
,
and
pressed
his
lips
to
it
.
<EOS>
His
example
was
followed
by
the
others
,
but
no
one
seemed
so
profoundly
affected
as
Warburton
.
<EOS>
The
new
earl
witnessed
this
touching
scene
in
silence
,
and
then
giving
some
needful
orders
to
the
butler
,
and
directing
that
the
household
should
be
admitted
to
view
the
body
of
their
deceased
lord
,
he
withdrew
to
an
adjoining
chamber
,
where
he
penned
a
despatch
to
the
king
,
acquainting
him
with
the
sad
event
,
and
adding
that
he
hoped
to
join
his
majesty
at
Nottingham
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
then
wrote
a
few
lines
to
his
wife
,
and
having
sent
off
messengers
with
the
letters
,
threw
himself
upon
a
couch
,
quite
worn
out
with
anxiety
and
fatigue
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
hours
'
slumber
,
the
new
Earl
of
Derby
arose
,
and
had
an
immediate
conference
with
Mr.
Hargrave
.
<EOS>
"I
am
compelled
to
attend
the
king
at
Nottingham
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
must
therefore
commit
the
management
of
my
father
's
funeral
to
you
.
<EOS>
The
body
will
lie
in
state
for
four
days
,
and
should
I
not
return
in
that
interval
,
you
will
cause
it
to
be
conveyed
,
without
pomp
or
ceremony
,
according
to
the
wishes
of
the
departed
,
to
the
church
of
Ormskirk
,
there
to
be
deposited
in
our
family
vault
beneath
the
Derby
chapel
by
the
side
of
my
angelic
mother
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
lordship
may
rely
on
me
,
"
replied
the
chaplain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
the
fifth
day
,
the
interment
shall
take
place
at
Ormskirk
,
as
you
have
directed
.
<EOS>
"CHAPTER
<EOS>
IVPrince
RupertBEFORE
setting
out
for
Nottingham
,
the
Earl
of
Derby
again
visited
the
chamber
of
the
dead
,
and
looked
his
last
upon
his
father
's
face
.
<EOS>
With
a
mournful
heart
he
then
mounted
his
steed
,
and
rode
off
,
accompanied
by
Captain
Standish
and
the
armed
attendants
he
had
brought
with
him
.
<EOS>
For
more
than
an
hour
he
spoke
not
a
word
,
and
seemed
occupied
in
painful
reflections
.
<EOS>
He
then
made
an
effort
to
rouse
himself
,
but
speedily
relapsed
into
silence
,
and
continued
in
the
same
melancholy
mood
till
they
reached
Mansfield
,
where
they
halted
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
the
earl
resumed
his
journey
,
and
the
sight
of
Nottingham
Castle
,
seated
on
a
precipitous
rock
,
overlooking
the
portion
of
Sherwood
Forest
across
which
he
was
riding
,
filled
him
with
emotions
very
different
from
those
he
had
experienced
on
the
previous
day
,
and
in
some
degree
dispelled
his
gloom
.
<EOS>
Above
the
fortress
could
be
seen
the
royal
standard
.
<EOS>
Proudly
it
floated
now
,
but
an
ill
omen
had
attended
its
first
display
.
<EOS>
Reared
on
the
castle
during
a
storm
,
it
was
speedily
blown
down
;
nor
could
it
be
set
up
again
till
the
fury
of
the
storm
had
abated
,
when
it
was
placed
on
the
keep
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Derby
did
not
forget
this
inauspicious
circumstance
,
and
it
surprised
him
to
find
that
the
castle
was
not
more
strongly
fortified
,
since
he
was
aware
the
Parliament
had
a
body
of
five
hundred
infantry
and
fifteen
hundred
horse
at
Coventry
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
cannon
on
the
walls
,
and
very
few
musketeers
.
<EOS>
While
he
mounted
the
steep
ascent
leading
to
the
gateway
,
trumpets
were
sounded
and
drums
beaten
,
and
a
troop
of
horse
came
forth
,
their
helmets
and
cuirasses
glittering
in
the
sun
.
<EOS>
They
were
a
remarkably
fine
body
of
men
,
and
very
well
mounted
.
<EOS>
Their
leader
was
a
very
striking
personage
,
and
instantly
attracted
Lord
Derby
's
attention
,
who
knew
him
at
a
glance
.
<EOS>
The
Cavalier
in
question
was
very
tall
,
and
possessed
a
spare
but
well
-
knit
and
vigorous
frame
.
<EOS>
His
dark
stern
visage
was
lighted
up
by
eyes
that
seemed
capable
of
the
fiercest
expression
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
thoroughly
military
bearing
,
and
no
one
could
look
at
him
without
seeing
that
,
young
as
he
was
,
he
had
served
in
many
a
campaign
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
richly
-
embroidered
buff
coat
,
encircled
by
a
crimson
scarf
,
and
crossed
by
a
magnificent
baldrick
,
from
which
a
long
sword
depended
.
<EOS>
Riding-
<EOS>
boots
ascending
above
the
knee
,
and
a
broad
-
leaved
Spanish
hat
,
ornamented
with
a
plume
of
white
feathers
,
completed
his
costume
.
<EOS>
His
fiery
steed
seemed
proud
of
his
rider
.
<EOS>
In
this
haughty
Cavalier
Lord
Derby
instantly
recognised
Prince
Rupert
,
the
king
's
nephew
,
and
the
brother
of
the
Elector
-
Palatine
.
<EOS>
Prince
Rupert
had
been
appointed
general
-
in
-
chief
of
the
royal
cavalry
quartered
at
Leicester
.
<EOS>
As
the
prince
's
quick
eye
alighted
on
the
earl
,
he
checked
his
impatient
steed
in
order
to
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
they
had
seen
little
of
each
other
,
though
Rupert
was
a
relative
of
the
countess
;
but
Lord
Derby
had
a
genuine
admiration
of
the
prince
,
whose
daring
and
military
skill
he
fully
appreciated
;
while
Rupert
,
though
sharing
the
king
's
belief
that
Lord
Derby
nourished
ambitious
designs
,
did
full
justice
to
his
noble
qualities
.
<EOS>
Courteous
salutations
passed
between
them
;
but
Prince
Rupert
's
manner
was
necessarily
grave
,
as
he
thus
addressed
the
earl:"I
have
to
offer
your
lordship
my
sincere
condolence
on
the
death
of
the
noble
earl
your
father
.
<EOS>
Intelligence
of
the
sad
event
was
received
by
his
majesty
this
morning
,
and
he
immediately
communicated
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
own
that
I
scarcely
thought
your
lordship
would
come
hither
at
a
season
of
such
heavy
affliction
;
but
I
did
not
estimate
aright
your
devotion
to
the
king
.
<EOS>
In
truth
,
he
has
great
need
of
your
services
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
not
too
much
to
say
that
you
alone
can
put
down
the
rebels
in
Lancashire
,
<EOS>
and
I
doubt
not
you
will
quickly
do
it
.
<EOS>
""Two
months
ago
I
could
have
crushed
the
rebellion
in
that
county
without
difficulty
,
your
highness
,
"
replied
the
earl
;
"
but
now
things
are
changed
.
<EOS>
Manchester
and
Bolton
are
both
strongly
fortified
and
well
garrisoned
.
<EOS>
""I
know
it
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Prince
Rupert
.
<EOS>
"
But
neither
town
can
hold
out
long
against
you
,
if
you
are
resolved
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
""Manchester
will
make
an
obstinate
resistance
,
"
remarked
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"If
it
should
be
so
,
put
the
whole
garrison
to
the
sword
,
"
said
the
prince
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
Spare
none
.
<EOS>
Too
much
leniency
has
been
shown
the
rebels
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
receive
your
orders
from
the
king
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
Lord
Molineux
and
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
Leicester
.
<EOS>
Farewell
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
Remember
me
,
I
pray
you
,
to
my
cousin
,
the
countess
.
<EOS>
I
hope
soon
to
hear
you
are
master
of
Manchester
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
Prince
Rupert
rode
down
the
hill
,
Lord
Derby
and
his
followers
,
passed
through
the
gateway
of
the
castle
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VCharles
<EOS>
the
FirstTHE
Earl
of
Derby
expected
to
find
the
court
thronged
with
musketeers
and
pike-
men
,
but
very
few
soldiers
were
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
Half
a
dozen
yeomen
of
the
guard
,
bearing
partisans
,
were
stationed
at
the
entrance
to
that
part
of
the
castle
occupied
by
the
king
and
his
suite
.
<EOS>
Having
dismounted
,
the
earl
proceeded
thither
followed
by
Frank
Standish
,
and
was
ceremoniously
conducted
by
a
groom
of
the
chambers
and
some
other
officers
of
the
household
to
the
royal
apartments
.
<EOS>
Frank
Standish
remained
in
the
guard
-
chamber
,
where
several
other
persons
were
waiting
,
but
the
earl
was
at
once
taken
to
the
king
's
cabinet
.
<EOS>
At
a
table
covered
with
papers
and
despatches
sat
Charles
.
<EOS>
Why
attempt
to
depict
the
features
of
the
unfortunate
monarch
,
since
all
are
familiar
with
them
,
and
can
summon
up
his
image
at
will
?
<EOS>
Suffice
it
to
say
,
that
although
the
king
looked
grave
and
melancholy
,
his
countenance
did
not
want
the
placidity
that
habitually
characterised
it
.
<EOS>
His
habiliments
were
of
black
velvet
,
and
a
falling
band
,
deeply
edged
with
lace
,
served
to
set
off
his
noble
head
.
<EOS>
With
the
king
were
the
two
persons
referred
to
by
Prince
Rupert
—
both
of
whom
were
friends
of
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
Viscount
Molineux
of
Maryborough
was
a
fine
-
looking
young
man
,
and
had
quite
the
air
of
a
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
of
Mierscough
Lodge
,
near
Lancaster
,
and
the
representative
of
an
old
Lancashire
family
,
was
likewise
a
handsome
man
,
but
somewhat
older
and
more
robust
than
his
companion
.
<EOS>
Both
were
accoutred
in
steel
breastplates
and
tassets
,
and
each
had
a
long
sword
suspended
from
a
baldrick
.
<EOS>
As
the
Earl
of
Derby
went
to
kiss
the
king
's
hand
,
his
majesty
said
earnestly:"My
lord
,
I
thank
you
for
coming
to
me
now
.
<EOS>
I
take
it
as
a
proof
of
your
devotion
.
<EOS>
""Your
majesty
is
well
aware
that
I
am
ever
ready
to
obey
your
behests
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
In
staying
to
receive
my
father
's
last
sigh
,
I
felt
sure
I
should
not
incur
your
majesty
's
displeasure
.
<EOS>
""I
should
have
been
sorry
if
you
had
done
otherwise
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Charles
;
"
and
if
you
had
tarried
to
lay
your
father
in
the
tomb
,
I
should
not
have
blamed
you
,
however
much
I
might
regret
your
absence
.
<EOS>
I
have
urgent
need
of
your
services
.
<EOS>
The
rebellion
is
making
rapid
progress
in
Lancashire
,
and
must
be
checked
.
<EOS>
No
one
can
accomplish
this
so
effectually
as
yourself
,
since
no
one
has
such
power
and
influence
as
you
have
in
the
county
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
consulting
with
Lord
Molineux
and
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
,
and
they
entirely
agree
with
me
that
to
your
lordship
alone
ought
the
task
to
be
entrusted
.
<EOS>
""Such
is
our
opinion
,
sire
,
"
observed
Lord
Molineux
.
<EOS>
"
No
one
can
raise
so
large
a
force
in
Lancashire
as
the
Earl
of
Derby
.
<EOS>
""That
is
quite
certain
,
"
added
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
majesty
will
recollect
that
his
lordship
once
raised
sixty
thousand
men
,
and
what
has
been
done
before
may
be
done
again
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
now
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
if
a
third
of
the
number
may
be
got
together
.
<EOS>
Had
your
majesty
deigned
to
follow
my
advice
,
and
raised
your
standard
at
Warrington
instead
of
here
,
at
Nottingham
,
you
would
now
have
a
large
army
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
this
,
I
fear
that
very
few
have
responded
to
your
proclamation
.
<EOS>
""Few
,
indeed
,
"
said
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
three
hundred
infantry
and
some
militia
brought
me
by
the
Sheriff
of
Nottinghamshire
.
<EOS>
""Not
more
,
sire
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
earl
,
startled
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
Leicester
I
have
eight
hundred
horse
,
"
pursued
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Prince
Rupert
has
just
been
here
,
and
urges
me
strongly
to
quit
this
castle
,
representing
to
me
that
I
am
in
great
danger
from
the
Parliamentarian
forces
at
Coventry
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
retire
from
Nottingham
.
<EOS>
""I
observe
there
is
no
cannon
on
the
wall
,
"
said
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
"
Should
an
attack
be
made
on
the
castle
how
can
you
resist
it
?
<EOS>
I
beseech
your
majesty
to
retire
in
time
,
or
you
may
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Lathom
House
is
fortified
,
and
would
stand
a
siege
.
<EOS>
Take
possession
of
it
,
sire
.
<EOS>
I
will
undertake
to
raise
you
two
thousand
foot
and
a
thousand
horse
.
<EOS>
With
these
you
can
hold
out
against
the
rebels
till
you
can
get
together
an
army
,
and
give
them
battle
.
<EOS>
""I
have
planted
my
standard
at
Nottingham
,
"
replied
the
king
;
"
and
at
Nottingham
I
will
remain
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
trust
myself
in
Lancashire
—
unless
at
the
head
of
an
army
,
and
it
seems
you
can
not
muster
six
thousand
men
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
large
force
I
had
mustered
has
dwindled
away
,
"
said
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
"Most
of
them
have
joined
the
rebels
,
"
observed
Lord
Molineux
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Derby
looked
grave
.
<EOS>
"I
have
come
here
in
obedience
to
your
summons
,
sire
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
serve
you?""I
may
ask
more
than
your
lordship
can
perform
,
"
said
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
My
desire
is
,
that
you
should
crush
the
rebellion
in
Lancashire
,
and
begin
with
Manchester
.
<EOS>
Can
you
do
this?""I
have
every
confidence
that
I
can
carry
out
your
wishes
,
sire
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
doubt
not
the
garrison
at
Manchester
will
be
strongly
reinforced
by
the
Parliament
.
<EOS>
I
may
not
,
therefore
,
be
able
to
accomplish
the
task
as
quickly
as
you
expect
.
<EOS>
I
believe
the
town
is
fully
prepared
for
a
siege
.
<EOS>
""Lord
<EOS>
Molineux
and
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
have
just
told
me
so
,
but
I
can
scarcely
credit
it
,
"
remarked
the
king
.
<EOS>
"A
German
engineer
,
named
Rosworm
,
has
thoroughly
fortified
the
town
,
sire
,
"
said
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
.
<EOS>
"There
will
be
this
advantage
in
the
siege
,
sire
,
that
it
will
distract
the
attention
of
the
enemy
from
Nottingham
,
"
observed
the
Earl
of
Derby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
I
most
dread
is
that
your
majesty
should
be
attacked
.
<EOS>
Once
more
I
beg
you
to
let
me
bring
you
all
the
aid
I
can
.
<EOS>
""I
will
send
to
you
,
if
it
should
be
necessary
,
"
said
Charles
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Southampton
,
Culpepper
,
and
others
of
my
council
suggest
that
I
should
propose
terms
of
peace
in
order
to
gain
time
—
<EOS>
but
I
like
not
the
plan
.
<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
good
advice
,
my
liege
,
"
rejoined
the
Earl
of
Derby
.
<EOS>
"
Much
may
be
done
while
the
question
is
discussed
,
and
if
some
successes
are
gained
in
Lancashire
,
the
present
posture
of
affairs
may
be
wholly
changed
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
revoke
my
proclamation
,
or
lower
my
tone
,
"
said
the
king
.
<EOS>
"It
is
not
necessary
to
do
so
,
sire
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
But
if
the
overtures
of
peace
should
be
rejected
by
the
Parliament
,
the
indignation
of
the
people
will
be
roused
,
and
troops
will
be
more
easily
raised
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
convince
me
by
your
reasoning
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
I
must
pray
your
majesty
to
permit
my
immediate
departure
,
"
said
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
Since
active
measures
are
resolved
upon
,
no
time
should
be
lost
in
putting
them
in
execution
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
I
trust
to
give
you
a
good
account
of
my
proceedings
.
<EOS>
""I
am
with
you
,
my
lord
,
unless
his
majesty
has
aught
more
to
say
to
me
,
"
observed
Lord
Molineux
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
I
,
"
added
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
be
absent
when
Manchester
is
to
be
besieged
.
<EOS>
""I
am
sorry
to
part
with
you
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
not
detain
you
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
a
profound
reverence
<EOS>
,
Lord
Derby
quitted
the
cabinet
followed
by
Lord
Molineux
,
and
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
.
<EOS>
In
the
ante
-
chamber
they
found
Frank
Standish
,
who
easily
perceived
from
the
earl
's
looks
that
he
was
far
from
satisfied
with
his
reception
by
the
king
;
and
the
impression
was
confirmed
when
he
learnt
that
Lord
Derby
intended
to
depart
forthwith
.
<EOS>
Without
a
moment
's
needless
delay
,
the
earl
quitted
Nottingham
Castle
with
his
friends
,
who
accompanied
him
to
Chester
.
<EOS>
Since
the
opportunity
was
offered
Lord
Derby
of
attending
his
father
's
funeral
,
he
caused
the
ceremonial
to
be
performed
on
the
following
day
,
and
laid
the
late
earl
's
remains
in
the
vault
beneath
the
Stanley
Chapel
in
Ormskirk
Church

<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIColonel
RoswormIN
an
inner
room
of
an
old
black
and
white
timber
and
plaster
house
situated
in
a
street
near
the
Collegiate
Church
in
Manchester
,
were
two
persons
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
,
whose
accoutrements
proclaimed
him
an
officer
of
rank
in
the
Parliamentary
army
,
was
Colonel
Richard
Holland
,
commander
of
the
garrison
and
governor
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
He
had
strongly
marked
features
,
and
an
authoritative
manner
,
though
on
the
present
occasion
he
had
somewhat
relaxed
his
importance
.
<EOS>
His
companion
,
unmistakably
a
foreigner
,
was
no
other
than
the
redoubted
German
engineer
,
of
whom
mention
has
been
previously
made
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Rosworm
was
about
fifty
,
and
had
served
under
Wallenstein
during
the
Thirty
Years
'
War
.
<EOS>
But
he
appeared
none
the
worse
for
the
hardships
he
had
undergone
.
<EOS>
His
cheeks
had
been
gashed
at
the
battle
of
Lutzen
,
but
this
circumstance
only
heightened
the
manly
character
of
his
physiognomy
,
and
indeed
the
scar
was
almost
hidden
by
a
bushy
red
beard
.
<EOS>
Though
his
look
was
determined
and
somewhat
stern
,
his
manner
was
distinguished
by
military
frankness
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
called
handsome
but
his
features
were
well
formed
,
and
his
figure
strong
and
well
-
proportioned
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
exceed
the
middle
height
,
but
bore
himself
so
well
that
he
looked
tall
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
famous
German
engineer
,
to
whom
the
defence
of
Manchester
against
the
Royalists
and
malignants
,
as
they
were
termed
,
had
been
entrusted
by
those
belonging
to
the
Puritan
faction
.
<EOS>
That
he
was
equal
to
the
task
seemed
now
conclusively
proved
by
the
effectual
manner
in
which
he
had
fortified
the
town
—
surrounding
it
entirely
with
mud
walls
,
and
protecting
the
entrances
with
stout
posts
,
chains
,
and
barricades
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Rosworm
's
plan
was
entirely
satisfactory
to
the
Parliamentary
governor
of
the
town
,
and
he
gave
it
his
unqualified
commendation
.
<EOS>
The
house
in
which
we
find
the
engineer
and
the
governor
belonged
to
the
former
.
<EOS>
He
had
occupied
it
ever
since
he
arrived
in
the
town
from
Ireland
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
small
habitation
,
but
quite
large
enough
for
himself
and
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Rosworm
was
a
widower
,
having
lost
his
wife
some
years
ago
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
left
him
a
most
lovely
girl
,
whom
he
guarded
with
as
much
vigilance
as
he
would
have
done
a
fortress
.
<EOS>
Gertrude
Rosworm
,
at
the
period
of
our
story
,
was
just
nineteen
,
and
remarkable
for
her
personal
attractions
.
<EOS>
Her
profuse
flaxen
locks
,
summer
blue
eyes
,
delicately
fair
complexion
,
and
graceful
figure
won
her
many
admirers
among
the
youth
of
the
town
,
but
none
of
them
were
allowed
by
her
jealous
father
to
approach
her
.
<EOS>
However
,
further
description
of
her
must
be
deferred
till
she
appears
on
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Rosworm
was
closeted
with
the
governor
in
a
small
room
opening
from
the
house
place
,
which
enjoyed
the
advantage
of
a
bay
window
looking
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
The
walls
were
garnished
with
pikes
,
swords
,
muskets
,
and
petronels
,
and
several
pieces
of
armour
and
steel
caps
were
hung
up
ready
for
use
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Rosworm
wore
a
buff
coat
and
boots
,
but
had
relieved
himself
of
his
sword
and
pistols
.
<EOS>
On
the
table
beside
them
was
a
flask
of
claret
and
a
couple
of
tall
glasses
.
<EOS>
They
were
talking
of
a
banquet
given
some
six
weeks
ago
by
a
gentleman
of
Manchester
to
Lord
Derby
—
then
Lord
Strange
—
at
which
time
a
tumult
occurred
in
the
town
when
several
persons
were
killed
.
<EOS>
"This
disastrous
affair
may
be
regarded
as
the
commencement
of
the
Civil
War
in
Manchester
,
"
observed
the
governor
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
not
think
Lord
Strange
altogether
in
fault
.
<EOS>
The
provocation
came
from
our
side
,
and
I
am
thankful
to
say
I
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
occurrence
took
place
just
before
my
arrival
,
"
remarked
Colonel
Rosworm
,
who
spoke
the
language
perfectly
,
though
with
a
strong
German
accent
;
"
but
it
does
not
appear
that
Lord
Strange
had
any
designs
upon
the
town
.
<EOS>
""He
merely
came
to
attend
a
grand
banquet
given
in
his
honour
,
"
replied
the
governor
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Girlington
,
sheriff
of
the
county
,
Lord
Molineux
,
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
,
Sir
Alexander
Radcliffe
,
Sir
Thomas
Prestwich
,
Sir
Edward
Mosley
,
of
Alport
Lodge
,
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
,
Mr.
Farrington
,
of
Worden
,
and
several
other
Royalist
gentlemen
were
present
,
but
all
might
have
passed
off
quietly
if
Colonel
Holcroft
and
Colonel
Birch
had
not
marched
into
the
town
with
a
large
party
of
men
,
armed
with
pikes
and
muskets
,
and
struck
up
their
drums
in
the
market
-
place
to
call
out
the
militia
.
<EOS>
""That
was
certain
to
cause
an
affray
,
"
remarked
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
they
merely
meant
to
disturb
the
party
at
the
banquet
.
<EOS>
""I
suspect
they
had
a
deeper
design
,
"
said
the
governor
.
<EOS>
"
But
be
that
as
it
may
,
they
were
interrupted
by
the
sheriff
,
who
quitted
the
banquet
,
and
suddenly
appeared
in
the
market
-
place
with
a
few
followers
,
and
ordered
them
in
the
king
's
name
to
lay
down
their
arms
,
and
keep
the
peace
.
<EOS>
They
refused
,
and
the
sheriff
was
unable
to
enforce
compliance
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Lord
Strange
,
with
Lord
Molineux
,
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
,
and
the
rest
of
the
gentlemen
likewise
quitted
the
banquet
,
and
came
to
the
sheriff
's
assistance
.
<EOS>
A
sharp
conflict
took
place
in
the
streets
,
during
which
several
men
were
killed
on
both
sides
,
but
it
ended
in
the
discomfiture
of
Holcroft
and
Birch
.
<EOS>
The
latter
would
have
been
shot
,
had
he
not
taken
refuge
under
a
cart
.
<EOS>
Lord
Strange
and
his
friends
were
highly
incensed
,
and
declared
it
was
a
treacherous
design
to
assassinate
them
.
<EOS>
Next
morning
the
chief
persons
of
the
town
waited
upon
his
lordship
,
who
was
a
guest
of
Sir
Alexander
Radcliffe
,
of
Ordsall
Hall
,
to
express
their
great
regret
at
the
occurrence
.
""Had
<EOS>
Lord
Strange
chosen
,
he
could
easily
have
taken
the
town
at
that
time
,
and
carried
off
the
magazine
,
"
observed
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
But
now
we
are
secure
from
attack
.
<EOS>
""We
<EOS>
shall
not
be
left
long
in
peace
,
"
said
the
governor
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Strange
has
just
succeeded
his
father
and
is
now
Earl
of
Derby
.
<EOS>
I
hear
he
is
raising
a
large
body
of
men
.
<EOS>
""Most
<EOS>
probably
he
will
march
to
the
king
's
assistance
,
"
rejoined
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"If
I
am
rightly
informed
he
has
received
orders
from
his
majesty
to
besiege
this
town
,
"
said
Colonel
Holland
.
<EOS>
"
We
may
therefore
expect
a
visit
from
him
shortly
.
<EOS>
""Come
<EOS>
when
he
may
he
will
find
us
prepared
,
"
said
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
your
excellency
apprehends
an
immediate
attack
it
may
be
well
to
provision
the
town
,
and
get
in
all
the
men
you
can
from
Bury
,
Rochdale
,
and
the
neighbouring
places
.
<EOS>
""I
have
sent
scouts
to
Warrington
where
the
earl
now
is
,
"
said
the
governor
,
"
and
expect
to
receive
precise
information
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
no
precautions
must
be
neglected
.
<EOS>
""Strict
<EOS>
watch
shall
be
kept
to
-
night
on
the
ramparts
and
at
the
gates
,
"
rejoined
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
I
myself
will
visit
the
sentinels
,
and
see
that
they
do
not
neglect
their
duty
.
<EOS>
If
aught
occurs
alarm
bells
shall
be
rung
,
and
a
light
displayed
from
the
church
tower
.
<EOS>
""You
have
not
served
under
the
great
Wallenstein
without
learning
something
,
colonel
,
"
observed
the
governor
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"I
have
learnt
that
he
who
guards
a
fortress
must
not
sleep
at
night
,
"
said
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
Depend
upon
it
the
enemy
shall
not
take
us
unawares
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
the
door
was
partly
opened
,
and
a
pleasant
voice
inquired:"May
<EOS>
I
come
in
<EOS>
,
father?"Rosworm
answered
in
the
affirmative
,
and
Gertrude
entered
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIIGertrude
RoswormHER
presence
seemed
to
light
up
the
little
room
.
<EOS>
A
lovely
blonde
with
the
fairest
tresses
,
and
the
tenderest
blue
eyes
imaginable
.
<EOS>
A
glance
from
those
blue
eyes
possessed
an
almost
resistless
witchery
.
<EOS>
Figure
slight
and
symmetrical
.
<EOS>
She
was
simply
,
yet
very
becomingly
attired
.
<EOS>
On
her
head
she
wore
a
coverchief
,
her
flaxen
locks
were
wholly
unconfined
,
and
allowed
to
flow
over
her
shoulders
.
<EOS>
A
kerchief
covered
her
neck
;
a
girdle
,
totally
destitute
of
ornament
,
spanned
her
slender
waist
;
and
her
gown
,
worn
long
enough
to
conceal
her
small
feet
,
was
made
of
the
plainest
stuff
.
<EOS>
No
ornament
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
As
she
entered
the
room
,
the
governor
rose
to
salute
her
.
<EOS>
Though
he
passed
no
compliments
upon
her
looks
,
he
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
his
admiration
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
dost
thou
want
with
me
,
child
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Rosworm
,
regarding
her
with
a
look
of
affection
,
not
unmingled
with
pride
—
for
the
engineer
was
very
proud
of
his
lovely
daughter
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
is
a
young
man
without
,
father
,
who
desires
to
speak
with
you
,
when
you
are
at
leisure
,
"
replied
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"Dost
know
him
?
"
demanded
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
neither
know
him
,
nor
did
he
tell
me
his
business
,
father
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
But
he
looks
a
gentle
youth
.
<EOS>
""Hum
!
"
exclaimed
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
I
warrant
me
he
hath
a
simpering
smile
like
some
of
the
lack
-
brains
who
haunt
my
door
.
<EOS>
""He
does
not
resemble
the
young
men
of
Manchester
,
father
,
"
replied
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
At
this
rejoinder
the
governor
laughed
heartily
.
<EOS>
"Did
<EOS>
he
not
give
thee
his
name?""No
,
father
,
"
she
replied
.
"
<EOS>
He
said
he
was
merely
a
messenger
.
<EOS>
""Bid
<EOS>
him
be
seated
.
<EOS>
I
will
speak
with
him
anon
,
"
rejoined
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"He
will
not
be
displeased
to
wait
if
you
will
bear
him
company
,
fair
damsel
,
"
laughed
the
governor
,
as
Gertrude
went
forth
.
<EOS>
Decidedly
,
the
messenger
was
a
very
handsome
young
man
,
and
could
not
be
a
Roundhead
,
since
his
long
brown
locks
fell
upon
his
shoulders
;
nor
was
it
easy
to
determine
his
rank
from
his
plain
riding
-
dress
,
but
it
must
be
owned
that
he
had
the
air
of
a
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
"Pray
be
seated
,
sir
,
"
said
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
will
see
you
presently
.
<EOS>
The
governor
of
the
town
is
with
him
.
<EOS>
""I
can
wait
his
leisure
,
"
replied
the
messenger
.
<EOS>
And
he
then
made
a
few
remarks
calculated
to
engage
her
in
conversation
;
his
manner
being
so
respectful
that
she
could
not
fail
to
be
pleased
with
him
.
<EOS>
"You
are
from
Germany
,
I
conclude
—
<EOS>
nay
,
I
am
certain
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
like
this
town
after
the
fine
old
cities
of
your
own
country?""Not
much
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
should
be
glad
to
go
back
to
Nuremberg
,
where
I
was
born
,
but
I
must
remain
here
with
my
father
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
will
not
care
if
the
town
is
besieged
?
<EOS>
"
remarked
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
,
I
am
a
soldier
's
daughter
,
and
accustomed
to
fighting
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
taught
to
fire
a
musket
,
and
can
hit
the
target
as
well
as
most
marksmen
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
am
not
altogether
unskilled
in
the
use
of
the
sword
.
""Being
<EOS>
thus
accomplished
,
'
tis
a
pity
<EOS>
you
can
not
serve
the
king
,
"
observed
the
messenger
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
father
has
entered
into
an
engagement
with
the
Parliament
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
your
own
sympathies
are
with
the
Royalists
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
""It
is
not
prudent
,
or
proper
,
to
make
such
observations
in
this
house
,
"
she
remarked
with
some
significance
.
<EOS>
"I
will
trust
you
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
more
,
I
think
you
will
aid
me
.
<EOS>
Listen
,
I
pray
you
,
"
he
said
,
altering
his
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sent
to
purchase
your
father
's
services
at
any
price
for
the
king
.
<EOS>
You
will
understand
that
I
have
full
authority
to
make
this
offer
when
I
tell
you
that
I
am
one
of
Lord
Derby
's
officers
—
Frank
Standish
.
<EOS>
""I
counsel
you
not
to
make
the
offer
to
my
father
,
"
said
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"
He
will
regard
it
as
an
affront
.
<EOS>
His
own
feelings
are
in
favour
of
the
king
,
but
he
will
never
desert
the
Parliament
.
<EOS>
""Cannot
<EOS>
you
induce
him
to
do
so
,
fair
damsel
?
<EOS>
"
besought
Standish
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
shall
not
make
the
attempt
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Take
my
advice
and
leave
the
town
as
quickly
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Holland
,
the
governor
,
is
with
my
father
,
and
should
he
discover
who
you
are
,
he
will
infallibly
cause
your
arrest
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
here
they
come
!
<EOS>
You
are
too
late
.
<EOS>
"This
exclamation
was
uttered
as
the
door
of
the
inner
room
opened
,
and
Rosworm
came
forth
with
the
governor
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
this
the
young
man
who
desires
to
speak
with
me
?
"
demanded
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"It
is
,
father
,
"
replied
Gertrude
,
with
some
hesitation
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
know
who
he
is
?
"
remarked
Colonel
Holland
.
<EOS>
Rosworm
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
"Then
I
will
tell
you
,
"
replied
the
governor
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
one
of
the
Earl
of
Derby
's
officers
—
Captain
Standish
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
hold
any
communication
with
him
.
<EOS>
""Certainly
not
,
"
replied
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
come
here
on
a
bootless
errand
,
sir
,
"
he
added
to
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
receive
no
message
from
the
Earl
of
Derby
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
need
trouble
you
no
further
,
"
replied
the
other
,
preparing
to
depart
.
<EOS>
"Stay
!
"
exclaimed
Colonel
Holland
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
a
safe
-
conduct?""I
have
,
sir
,
"
replied
Standish
,
producing
a
paper
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
me
look
at
it
,
"
said
the
governor
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
handed
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
After
glancing
at
the
passport
,
Colonel
Holland
returned
it
,
and
said
in
a
stern
tone:"You
are
free
to
depart
.
<EOS>
But
quit
the
town
at
once
,
or
you
will
be
treated
as
a
spy
.
<EOS>
""When
<EOS>
I
next
appear
,
it
will
be
to
summon
you
in
the
king
's
name
to
surrender
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
And
with
a
haughty
bow
to
the
governor
he
quitted
the
house
.
<EOS>
"I
think
I
ought
to
have
ordered
his
arrest
,
"
observed
Colonel
Holland
.
<EOS>
"You
did
better
to
let
him
go
,
"
rejoined
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
He
will
tell
Lord
Derby
that
we
are
prepared
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
had
a
safe
-
conduct
.
<EOS>
""True
,
"
said
the
governor
.
<EOS>
Gertrude
made
no
remark
,
but
she
was
evidently
well
pleased
that
the
young
man
had
got
off
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Frank
Standish
pursued
his
way
along
a
narrow
street
that
skirted
the
churchyard
,
and
led
him
to
the
top
of
Smithy
Bank
,
whence
he
could
distinguish
the
bridge
across
the
Irwell
,
and
noticed
that
it
was
strongly
defended
by
posts
and
chains
.
<EOS>
He
also
remarked
that
a
guard
was
stationed
at
the
upper
end
of
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
stop
to
make
any
further
observations
;
perceiving
that
his
movements
were
watched
,
and
that
he
was
an
object
of
suspicion
to
several
of
the
townspeople
whom
he
encountered
.
<EOS>
As
he
proceeded
towards
Deansgate
,
he
caught
sight
of
the
mud
-
walls
with
which
Colonel
Rosworm
had
surrounded
the
town
.
<EOS>
The
ramparts
were
about
ten
or
twelve
feet
high
,
and
proportionately
thick
,
and
no
doubt
would
completely
shelter
the
musketeers
stationed
behind
them
.
<EOS>
At
the
bottom
of
Market
-
street
Lane
,
there
was
an
outlet
to
Acres
Fields
,
and
this
was
protected
by
posts
and
chains
.
<EOS>
In
Deansgate
a
barricade
was
erected
.
<EOS>
Externally
,
the
fortifications
ran
round
this
part
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
Frank
Standish
having
already
exhibited
his
safe
-
conduct
from
Sir
Edward
Mosley
to
the
guard
stationed
at
the
barricade
,
was
permitted
to
quit
the
town
without
any
hindrance
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIIIAlport
LodgeON
this
side
of
Manchester
,
at
the
period
in
question
,
and
at
no
great
distance
from
the
town
,
stood
Alport
Lodge
,
a
mansion
belonging
to
Sir
Edward
Mosley
.
<EOS>
Situated
in
the
midst
of
a
large
park
that
extended
nearly
to
Castlefield
,
and
ran
down
to
the
left
bank
of
the
Irwell
,
the
house
was
almost
concealed
by
trees
.
<EOS>
As
Sir
Edward
Mosley
was
a
staunch
Royalist
,
the
proximity
of
his
mansion
to
the
town
was
by
no
means
agreeable
to
the
Roundheads
,
who
often
threatened
to
despoil
the
park
,
and
knock
the
house
about
his
ears
;
but
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
execute
their
threats
,
probably
because
Sir
Edward
kept
a
considerable
number
of
armed
retainers
,
and
would
undoubtedly
have
made
a
vigorous
resistance
.
<EOS>
The
park
gates
were
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
the
town
,
and
were
always
kept
shut
and
guarded
.
<EOS>
Frank
Standish
,
however
,
passed
through
them
,
and
proceeded
to
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
Nothing
indicated
that
the
house
was
occupied
by
a
troop
of
horse
belonging
to
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
,
who
had
arrived
there
late
on
the
previous
night
,
and
had
taken
up
their
quarters
so
quickly
,
that
their
presence
was
not
suspected
by
the
neighbouring
Parliamentarians
.
<EOS>
Every
precaution
was
taken
to
prevent
discovery
.
<EOS>
No
troopers
were
seen
in
Alport
park
,
and
when
Frank
Standish
visited
the
town
,
as
just
described
,
he
was
wholly
unattended
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
mansion
,
Standish
found
Sir
Edward
Mosley
and
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
in
the
entrance
hall
,
and
at
once
informed
them
that
his
errand
had
proved
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
"Nothing
<EOS>
is
to
be
done
with
Rosworm
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
incorruptible
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
even
obtain
a
word
with
him
in
private
;
but
I
had
some
converse
with
his
daughter
,
and
she
quite
satisfied
me
that
her
father
will
not
listen
to
any
proposition
.
<EOS>
Rosworm
would
have
preferred
the
king
to
the
Parliament
in
the
first
instance
,
but
since
he
has
engaged
with
the
latter
,
he
will
remain
firm
.
<EOS>
""I
am
sorry
for
it
,
"
said
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
.
<EOS>
"
He
would
have
been
of
infinite
use
to
us
.
<EOS>
But
how
looks
the
town
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
has
thoroughly
fortified
it?""So
far
as
I
could
discern
,
I
think
he
has
put
it
into
a
good
state
of
defence
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
did
not
see
any
of
the
militia
,
and
there
were
few
armed
men
in
the
market
-
place
and
streets
.
<EOS>
""All
<EOS>
the
entrances
are
guarded
,
are
they
not
?
"
remarked
Sir
Edward
Mosley
.
<EOS>
"
The
garrison
can
not
have
relaxed
in
vigilance?""The
watch
did
not
seem
to
me
very
strictly
kept
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
clear
the
governor
has
received
no
intelligence
of
Lord
Derby
's
approach
.
<EOS>
""His
<EOS>
lordship
would
not
leave
Warrington
with
his
company
of
horse
and
foot
till
this
morning
,
"
said
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
;
"
but
the
march
of
nigh
three
thousand
men
can
not
be
kept
concealed
.
<EOS>
The
news
of
their
advance
will
reach
Manchester
before
night
.
<EOS>
""It
will
then
be
too
late
to
make
any
further
preparations
for
defence
,
or
obtain
assistance
from
the
rebels
in
the
neighbourhood
,
"
observed
Standish
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
fear
not
,
"
said
Sir

"
From
all
I
have
heard
,
a
very
considerable
force
can
be
quickly
collected
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
neighbouring
gentlemen
,
well
affected
to
the
Parliament
,
have
promised
aid
,
and
are
holding
themselves
in
readiness
for
a
summons

Peter
Egerton

Colonel
Duckenfield

Captain
John

Captain

""A
<EOS>
goodly
list
,
in
sooth
,
"
said
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
.
<EOS>
"
Most
of
them
are
old
friends
of
my
own
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
sad
to
think
that
gentlemen
of
good
family
should
turn
rebels
and
traitors
.
<EOS>
Heaven
grant
that
Lord
Derby
may
arrive
here
before
they
can
bring
succour
to
the
town!"Here
<EOS>
their
discourse
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
a
messenger
from
Lord
Derby
,
who
had
reached
Ashton
-
upon
-
Mersey
,
where
he
was
detained
at
the
ford
in
consequence
of
an
accident
to
one
of
the
carriages
of
his
artillery
.
<EOS>
The
messenger
brought
word
that
his
lordship
had
left
Warrington
at
an
early
hour
that
morning
,
with
the
whole
of
his
force
—
namely
,
two
thousand
foot
and
six
hundred
horse
,
of
whom
two
hundred
were
dragoons
.
<EOS>
He
had
with
him
ten
large
pieces
of
ordnance
.
<EOS>
The
force
had
marched
in
two
bodies
,
the
larger
division
,
commanded
by
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
who
had
with
him
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
,
Sir
Alexander
Radcliffe
,
Sir
Gilbert
Gerard
,
Mr.
Charles
Townley
,
Captain
Windebank
,
Mr.
Farrington
of
Worden
,
Mr.
Tarbock
of
Tarbock
,
and
several
others
,
marched
along
the
left
bank
of
the
Mersey
to
Ashton
,
where
they
were
detained
as
already
mentioned
.
<EOS>
The
other
and
lesser
division
,
commanded
by
Sir
John
Girlington
,
high
sheriff
of
Lancashire
,
who
was
accompanied
by
Lord
Molineux
,
Mr.
Byrom
of
Byrom
,
and
other
gentlemen
of
note
,
meant
to
take
its
way
through
Wolston
and
Rixton
,
between
Chat
Moss
and
the
right
bank
of
the
Irwell
,
through
Barton
and
Eccles
,
to
Salford
.
<EOS>
The
arrival
of
Lord
Molineux
with
his
division
,
added
the
messenger
,
might
soon
be
looked
for
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
the
message
been
delivered
,
when
it
was
made
evident
that
information
of
the
approach
of
the
Royalists
had
reached
the
town
—
the
bells
from
the
church
-
tower
and
other
buildings
being
rung
loudly
and
continuously
to
summon
aid
.
<EOS>
Anxious
to
see
what
was
doing
,
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
ordered
out
a
party
of
horse
,
and
accompanied
by
Sir
Robert
Mosley
and
Captain
Standish
,
both
of
whom
had
mounted
their
steeds
,
rode
towards
the
town
to
reconnoitre
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
approach
within
musket
-
shot
—
their
object
not
being
to
commence
the
attack
.
<EOS>
But
when
they
descried
any
men
on
horseback
sallying
forth
from
the
various
outlets
,
they
pursued
them
and
drove
them
back
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
bells
continued
their
clamour
,
and
ere
long
numbers
of
countrymen
armed
with
bills
,
pikes
,
clubs
,
and
other
weapons
,
appeared
;
and
began
to
flock
towards
the
town
.
<EOS>
Some
of
these
could
have
been
intercepted
,
but
as
they
were
speedily
followed
by
parties
of
well
-
armed
horsemen
,
it
was
deemed
expedient
not
to
molest
them
.
<EOS>
After
some
time
spent
in
these
observations
,
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
retired
with
his
party
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
,
however
,
return
to
Alport
Lodge
,
but
proceeded
in
the
direction
of
Stretford
,
with
the
intention
of
riding
on
to
the
ford
over
the
Mersey
at
Ashton
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
got
beyond
Old
Trafford
,
when
they
perceived
a
company
of
horsemen
,
and
at
once
comprehending
that
the
troop
belonged
to
Lord
Derby
,
hastened
forward
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
As
they
expected
,
this
was
the
advanced
guard
of
the
earl
's
division
,
and
was
commanded
by
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
,
from
whom
they
learnt
that
the
whole
force
,
together
with
the
artillery
,
had
safely
crossed
the
ford
.
<EOS>
In
another
minute
,
the
main
body
came
in
sight
,
headed
by
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
Sir
Alexander
Radcliffe
,
and
others
,
and
a
meeting
took
place
between
them
and
their
friends
.
<EOS>
Save
for
the
accident
to
the
gun
-
carriage
,
nothing
untoward
had
happened
during
Lord
Derby
's
march
from
Warrington
,
and
all
his
men
,
both
horse
and
foot
,
were
in
good
order
.
<EOS>
It
now
became
necessary
to
find
quarters
for
them
for
the
night
;
but
this
was
easily
managed
,
since
there
was
no
lack
of
barns
and
farm
-
houses
near
Hulme
and
Chorlton
.
<EOS>
A
strong
guard
,
that
remained
under
arms
all
night
,
was
placed
opposite
Deansgate
,
and
another
strong
guard
stationed
at
the
upper
end
of
Market
-
street
Lane
.
<EOS>
As
a
matter
of
course
,
quarters
were
provided
for
the
Earl
of
Derby
and
some
of
the
Royalist
gentlemen
with
him
,
while
others
were
lodged
at
Hulme
Hall
and
Rusholme
Place
.
<EOS>
Wishing
to
confer
with
Lord
Molineux
and
Sir
John
Girlington
,
Lord
Derby
had
no
sooner
given
all
needful
orders
,
than
he
set
out
for
Salford
,
taking
with
him
Captain
Standish
and
half
a
dozen
dragoons
.
<EOS>
To
reach
Salford
it
was
needful
to
cross
the
river
Irwell
by
the
ferry
,
situated
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
Castle
Field
,
and
to
this
point
the
earl
rode
with
his
attendants
,
and
quickly
gained
the
opposite
bank
,
for
the
ferry
-
boat
had
been
previously
secured
,
and
was
waiting
for
him
.
<EOS>
Night
had
now
come
on
,
but
Lord
Derby
was
well
acquainted
with
the
road
,
and
the
lights
glimmering
in
Salford
served
to
guide
him
.
<EOS>
Salford
was
full
of
soldiers
,
every
house
being
occupied
,
and
a
good
deal
of
drinking
and
merry
-
making
going
on
.
<EOS>
Totally
different
from
Manchester
,
from
which
town
it
was
only
separated
by
the
river
,
Salford
remained
faithful
to
the
king
.
<EOS>
Lord
Molineux
and
Sir
John
Girlington
had
been
warmly
welcomed
by
the
inhabitants
,
who
heartily
wished
them
success
.
<EOS>
The
two
leaders
had
taken
up
their
quarters
in
a
large
house
situated
in
the
street
leading
to
the
bridge
,
and
there
Lord
Derby
found
them
.
<EOS>
The
march
from
Warrington
had
been
accomplished
without
difficulty
,
and
without
the
loss
of
a
single
man
.
<EOS>
Already
,
Lord
Molineux
had
posted
three
companies
of
musketeers
in
sheltered
spots
,
and
had
raised
a
battery
with
three
pieces
of
cannon
near
the
foot
of
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
Unluckily
,
the
bridge
was
barricaded
by
Rosworm
and
strongly
fortified
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
the
banks
on
the
Manchester
side
of
the
Irwell
were
steep
and
rocky
,
and
considerably
higher
than
those
on
the
Salford
side
,
while
the
walls
of
the
churchyard
on
the
left
,
at
which
a
party
of
musketeers
were
stationed
,
completely
commanded
the
bridge
and
its
approaches
,
as
well
as
the
opposite
houses
.
<EOS>
In
this
advantageous
position
a
small
piece
of
artillery
had
been
planted
by
the
skilful
German
engineer
.
<EOS>
Through
the
gloom
could
be
dimly
distinguished
the
noble
Collegiate
Church
.
<EOS>
On
the
summit
of
the
lofty
square
tower
that
faced
the
river
,
a
dozen
musketeers
were
now
stationed
,
while
,
if
necessary
,
a
beacon
could
be
instantly
lighted
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
of
the
churchyard
,
a
dark
mass
of
buildings
indicated
the
position
of
the
college
,
while
,
on
the
right
of
the
bridge
,
the
precipitous
banks
were
covered
with
ancient
habitations
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
sombre
picture
presented
to
the
Earl
of
Derby
as
he
stood
with
Lord
Molineux
and
Sir
John
Girlington
at
the
lower
end
of
the
old
bridge
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
gazing
at
it
,
when
a
shot
,
fired
from
the
walls
of
the
churchyard
,
struck
a
building
near
them
.
<EOS>
The
earl
did
not
change
his
position
,
nor
would
he
allow
the
shot
to
be
returned
.
<EOS>
After
such
an
inspection
as
could
be
made
under
the
circumstances
,
Lord
Derby
left
Salford
and
proceeded
with
Sir
Alexander
Radcliffe
to
Ordsall
Hall
,
where
he
remained
for
a
short
time
discussing
his
plans
for
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
then
re
-
crossed
the
river
by
the
ferry
,
and
returned
to
Alport
Lodge
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IXA
View
of
Old
Manchester
from
the
Tower
of
the
Collegiate
ChurchGreat
anxiety
prevailed
among
the
townspeople
of
Manchester
,
when
they
awoke
next
morning
,
and
found
themselves
invested
by
the
forces
of
the
Earl
of
Derby
.
<EOS>
Except
on
the
north
-
west
,
the
approaches
to
the
town
were
cut
off
by
the
besiegers
.
<EOS>
A
battery
had
been
reared
by
the
earl
,
on
which
five
large
pieces
of
ordnance
were
mounted
,
destined
to
rake
the
centre
of
Deansgate
;
another
small
piece
of
artillery
,
called
a
drake
,
was
likewise
placed
opposite
the
mount
in
Acres
Field
.
<EOS>
Throughout
the
whole
of
the
night
Rosworm
had
been
on
the
watch
,
and
had
frequently
made
the
round
of
the
fortifications
to
see
that
the
sentinels
were
at
their
posts
.
<EOS>
Just
as
it
began
to
get
light
,
he
ascended
to
the
summit
of
the
church
-
tower
,
whence
he
could
survey
the
whole
scene
,
and
note
the
exact
position
of
the
besiegers
.
<EOS>
Placed
in
an
elevated
position
in
the
very
centre
of
the
town
,
which
it
completely
overlooked
,
as
well
as
the
adjacent
country
for
miles
round
,
the
noble
old
church
,
now
raised
into
a
cathedral
,
could
not
fail
to
play
an
important
part
in
the
defence
against
the
threatened
attack
of
the
Royalists
.
<EOS>
The
ancient
fabric
,
as
we
have
intimated
,
was
surrounded
by
a
large
churchyard
,
extending
on
one
side
to
the
very
edge
of
the
precipitous
banks
of
the
Irwell
,
from
which
it
was
defended
by
a
low
stone
wall
,
that
offered
a
most
advantageous
position
for
the
musketeers
,
and
combined
with
the
lofty
church-
tower
rising
behind
it
to
render
an
attack
upon
the
bridge
exceedingly
perilous
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
no
part
of
the
town
was
so
strong
as
that
adjacent
to
the
church
.
<EOS>
Protected
by
high
precipitous
banks
,
by
walls
which
could
be
turned
into
fortifications
,
and
by
buildings
that
could
be
occupied
by
musketeers
,
it
really
presented
a
very
formidable
aspect
.
<EOS>
At
the
back
of
the
church
,
and
running
along
Hunt
's
Bank
,
which
likewise
faced
the
Irwell
,
were
the
high
stone
walls
bounding
a
large
court
-
yard
belonging
to
the
college
.
<EOS>
Beyond
was
the
college
itself
,
a
large
stone
structure
reared
on
the
banks
of
the
river
Irk
,
near
its
confluence
with
the
Irwell
.
<EOS>
At
this
point
there
was
a
small
bridge
over
the
Irk
,
now
strongly
barricaded
,
and
having
an
outpost
in
advance
,
so
as
completely
to
defend
the
approach
to
the
town
on
this
side
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
side
of
the
churchyard
was
an
avenue
,
terminated
by
the
Mill
Gate
,
which
was
likewise
strongly
barricaded
,
but
since
this
side
of
the
town
had
not
been
invested
,
communication
could
be
kept
up
with
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
Viewed
from
the
summit
of
the
lofty
church
-
tower
,
which
,
as
we
have
said
,
commanded
the
whole
scene
,
the
town
and
its
environs
presented
a
very
curious
picture
.
<EOS>
The
morning
was
bright
and
clear
,
so
that
every
detail
could
be
perfectly
examined
.
<EOS>
Composed
,
as
already
mentioned
,
of
black
and
white
timber
and
plaster
habitations
,
the
town
was
almost
quadrangular
in
form
,
being
strongest
on
the
north
-
west
,
where
it
was
bounded
by
the
Irwell
and
the
Irk
,
the
banks
of
both
rivers
being
steep
and
rocky
,
especially
near
the
church
.
<EOS>
On
the
north
-
east
were
Shude
Hill
and
Mill
Lane
,
then
little
more
than
fields
,
partially
enclosed
,
and
on
the
south
-
east
was
an
avenue
conducting
to
the
market
-
place
.
<EOS>
This
,
with
Deansgate
on
the
south
,
formed
the
principal
approach
to
the
town
.
<EOS>
Except
on
the
side
protected
by
the
high
banks
of
the
Irwell
and
the
Irk
,
as
above
mentioned
,
the
whole
of
the
town
was
surrounded
by
mud
walls
and
bulwarks
raised
by
the
indefatigable
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
Commencing
on
the
left
bank
of
the
Irwell
on
the
south
-
west
,
these
fortifications
passed
Deansgate
,
at
the
further
extremity
of
which
there
was
a
barricade
,
enclosed
the
whole
of
Acres
Field
,
and
Pool
Fold
,
where
Radcliffe
Hall
was
situated
,
passed
on
to
the
upper
end
of
Market
-
street
Lane
,
and
skirting
the
fields
between
that
thoroughfare
and
Shude
Hill
,
terminated
at
the
bottom
of
Mill
Lane
,
where
,
as
already
mentioned
,
there
was
a
strong
barricade
.
<EOS>
In
Acres
Field
and
at
no
great
distance
from
Radcliffe
Hall
—
a
picturesque
old
mansion
,
occupied
by
Captain
Richard
Radcliffe
—
a
mount
had
been
reared
,
whereon
two
small
pieces
of
cannon
were
planted
.
<EOS>
Here
,
also
,
was
a
large
building
in
which
the
troops
composing
the
garrison
were
quartered
,
and
where
the
magazine
was
kept
.
<EOS>
Various
outbuildings
were
used
as
stables
by
the
cavalry
.
<EOS>
Very
striking
was
the
appearance
of
the
town
,
as
beheld
on
that
morning
from
the
summit
of
the
church
-
tower
.
<EOS>
Outside
the
walls
on
the
south
,
near
Alport
Lodge
,
above
which
floated
the
royal
banner
,
a
battery
had
been
reared
by
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
the
large
guns
of
which
commanded
the
centre
of
Deansgate
.
<EOS>
Behind
this
battery
several
companies
of
infantry
were
drawn
up
;
while
a
formidable
display
of
well
-
equipped
cavalry
was
likewise
made
.
<EOS>
But
the
spectators
of
this
scene
were
chiefly
interested
by
a
party
of
horsemen
who
were
slowly
making
the
circuit
of
the
fortifications
.
<EOS>
At
the
head
of
the
troop
was
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
easily
to
be
distinguished
by
his
war
-
horse
and
accoutrements
.
<EOS>
He
was
attended
by
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
,
Sir
Edward
Mosley
,
Sir
Alexander
Radcliffe
,
Sir
Gilbert
Gerard
,
Mr.
Farrington
of
Worden
,
Mr.
Roger
Nowell
of
Read
,
Mr.
Windebank
,
Mr.
Prestwich
of
Hulme
,
and
several
other
gentlemen
of
distinction
,
who
made
a
goodly
show
.
<EOS>
Each
had
an
officer
with
him
.
<EOS>
Captain
Standish
acted
as
Lord
Derby
's
aide
-
de
-
camp
.
<EOS>
Though
the
party
rode
slowly
on
,
not
a
shot
was
fired
from
the
walls
,
orders
having
been
given
by
the
governor
of
the
town
to
await
the
attack
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Various
small
parties
of
horsemen
were
galloping
round
the
fortifications
.
<EOS>
The
spectacle
presented
by
the
besieging
force
stationed
in
Salford
was
not
so
striking
as
that
offered
by
the
troops
in
Alport
Park
,
but
the
preparations
for
attack
were
equally
formidable
.
<EOS>
A
battery
of
five
large
pieces
of
ordnance
had
been
reared
at
the
foot
of
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
Several
troops
of
musketeers
were
stationed
in
the
gardens
on
the
banks
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
Others
could
likewise
be
seen
at
the
open
windows
of
the
houses
,
and
a
few
had
climbed
the
roofs
,
and
ensconced
themselves
behind
the
tall
stacks
of
chimneys
.
<EOS>
After
carefully
noting
all
the
preparations
of
the
besiegers
both
in
Alport
Park
and
Salford
,
and
giving
some
instructions
to
the
musketeers
,
Rosworm
descended
from
the
church
-
tower
.
<EOS>
As
he
issued
into
the
churchyard
,
he
perceived
a
large
body
of
men
,
completely
armed
,
who
must
have
entered
the
town
during
the
night
,
since
he
had
not
seen
them
before
.
<EOS>
On
inquiry
,
he
learnt
they
were
tenants
of
Mr.
Ralph
Assheton
of
Middleton
,
and
commanded
by
Captain
Robert
Bradshaw
from
Bolton
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
Colonel
Holland
made
his
appearance
with
Colonel
Egerton
,
Colonel
Robert
Duckenfield
,
Captain
John
Booth
,
Captain
Birch
,
and
Sergeant-
<EOS>
Major
Radcliffe
of
Radcliffe
Hall
,
who
had
the
command
of
the
town
forces
.
<EOS>
A
war
council
was
then
held
on
the
spot
by
these
leaders
,
assisted
by
Rosworm
,
at
which
it
was
decided
that
Captain
Bradshaw
,
with
his
company
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
men
,
should
take
up
a
position
in
Deansgate
against
the
battery
raised
by
the
Earl
of
Derby
near
Alport
Lodge
;
that
Market
-
street
Lane
should
be
guarded
by
Major
Radcliffe
,
the
Mill
Gate
by
Captain
Booth
,
and
Shude
Hill
by
Captain
Birch
.
<EOS>
The
defence
of
the
bridge
was
entrusted
to
Colonel
Rosworm
,
who
undertook
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
crossing
it
.
<EOS>
These
arrangements
concluded
,
Captain
Bradshaw
marched
off
to
take
up
his
perilous
position
in
Deansgate
,
and
Major
Radcliffe
proceeded
to
Radcliffe
Hall
to
collect
his
men
,
but
Captain
Booth
and
Captain
Birch
were
still
conferring
with
Colonel
Holland
and
Rosworm
,
when
two
divines
,
as
their
clerical
garb
proclaimed
them
,
entered
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XWarden
Heyrick
and
Mr.
BourneONE
of
these
was
the
Reverend
Richard
Heyrick
,
warden
of
the
Collegiate
Church
.
<EOS>
His
deportment
and
features
indicated
a
proud
and
overbearing
character
.
<EOS>
He
had
become
extremely
popular
among
the
Puritanical
faction
in
the
town
by
his
determined
enmity
to
the
Papists
,
and
his
opposition
to
all
the
movements
of
the
Royalists
.
<EOS>
Warden
Heyrick
was
a
man
of
great
eloquence
,
and
unsparing
in
his
denunciations
of
Papacy
,
as
an
extract
from
one
of
his
intolerant
exhortations
will
suffice
to
show
.
<EOS>
"
Whence
is
it
,
men
and
brethren
,
"
he
exclaimed
,
"
that
Popery
so
far
prevails
at
this
day
—
that
Popery
so
much
increases
among
us
?
<EOS>
I
beseech
you
that
are
armed
with
authority
go
to
the
utmost
of
your
authority
!
<EOS>
You
that
have
power
to
punish
,
punish
!
<EOS>
to
indict
,
indict
!
<EOS>
to
present
,
present
!
<EOS>
Let
not
Papists
rest
in
peace
,
in
security
by
you
!
<EOS>
If
the
chiefest
and
greatest
men
of
a
parish
be
Papists
,
their
children
,
their
servants
,
their
tenants
,
their
poor
neighbours
,
their
rich
kindred
and
friends
,
are
all
in
danger
by
them
.
<EOS>
My
lord
will
have
his
followers
as
well
of
his
vices
as
of
his
person
.
<EOS>
If
he
leave
his
friend
at
the
church
door
,
he
turns
not
back
without
his
attendants
.
<EOS>
If
his
honour
please
to
be
idolatrous
,
they
will
wait
on
him
to
mass
.
<EOS>
You
that
keep
back
the
sword
from
doing
justice
when
Heaven
calls
for
it
,
you
may
yourselves
die
by
the
sword
,
and
the
blood
of
all
that
perish
by
your
neglect
shall
lie
upon
your
heads
.
<EOS>
Crudelitas
pro
Christo
pietas
est
.
<EOS>
Cruelty
for
Christ
is
godliness
.
<EOS>
"Again
<EOS>
,
in
a
sermon
delivered
in
the
Collegiate
Church
just
before
the
outbreak
of
the
Civil
War
,
he
said
:
"
War
is
only
sweet
to
them
that
are
ignorant
of
it
.
<EOS>
Our
kingdom
hath
enjoyed
a
longer
time
of
peace
than
some
kingdoms
have
.
<EOS>
Our
age
hath
not
been
roused
with
the
barking
of
uncouth
wolves
;
the
midnight
drum
hath
not
frightened
our
sleep
;
the
sounding
trumpet
has
not
deafened
our
ears
;
our
beacons
have
not
been
fired
,
our
ships
arrested
,
or
our
walls
manned
;
our
towns
have
not
been
ransacked
,
our
houses
ruined
;
we
have
not
sowed
and
the
stranger
reaped
;
we
have
not
built
,
and
the
enemy
possessed
;
we
have
not
been
confounded
with
strange
languages
;
but
peace
hath
been
within
our
walls
,
and
plenteousness
within
our
dwellings;—Peace
,
the
daughter
of
the
Gospel
of
Peace
—
Plenty
,
the
daughter
of
Peace
—
Peace
,
the
glory
of
Heaven
,
the
joy
of
the
whole
world
.
<EOS>
"That
<EOS>
Warden
Heyrick
had
become
friendly
to
Puritanism
,
is
made
manifest
in
a
passage
of
one
of
his
sermons
which
runs
thus:—"Of
late
,
I
have
heard
them
much
branded
with
the
name
of
Puritan
that
would
not
yield
up
their
souls
and
consciences
to
the
chair
of
bishops
,
with
their
estates
,
liberties
,
and
lives
to
the
will
of
their
superiors
.
<EOS>
The
name
is
very
large
and
very
reproachful
.
<EOS>
A
bishop
affirmed
he
could
as
well
fetch
one
from
the
guilt
of
felony
as
from
the
imputation
of
Puritanism
.
<EOS>
My
humble
notion
is
,
make
us
all
Puritans
,
or
leave
no
Puritan
among
us!"That
the
warden
foresaw
<EOS>
the
consequences
of
his
infuriated
discourses
we
do
not
believe
,
but
they
did
infinite
mischief
.
<EOS>
Warden
Heyrick
was
a
very
striking
-
looking
personage
—
tall
,
erect
,
and
dignified
in
deportment
,
but
easily
excited
,
when
his
gestures
were
scarcely
under
his
command
,
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
flash
fire
.
<EOS>
At
one
time
the
Earl
of
Derby
had
entertained
a
very
high
opinion
of
him
,
but
he
looked
upon
him
latterly
as
a
mischievous
bigot
.
<EOS>
With
the
warden
was
Mr.
Bourne
,
a
fellow
of
the
Collegiate
Church
,
but
quite
as
puritanical
in
his
opinions
as
Heyrick
himself
.
<EOS>
He
had
become
a
professed
Presbyterian
,
and
has
been
styled
from
his
efforts
to
reform
the
church
,
the
John
Knox
of
Manchester
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bourne
was
aged
and
infirm
,
and
for
some
weeks
had
been
confined
to
his
bed
,
but
he
roused
himself
to
encourage
the
townspeople
to
resist
the
Popish
besiegers
,
as
he
designated
the
force
under
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
A
miracle
seemed
to
have
been
wrought
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
Up
to
that
morning
,
he
appeared
almost
incapable
of
exertion
,
but
his
strength
suddenly
returned
,
and
he
now
walked
about
almost
without
assistance
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
was
accompanied
by
the
two
chaplains
,
Mr.
Hollingworth
,
and
Mr.
Walker
,
who
were
likewise
professed
Presbyterians
.
<EOS>
By
the
Puritans
Mr.
Bourne
was
regarded
with
the
highest
respect
,
and
they
declared
he
had
long
been
a
blessing
to
the
town
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
bore
traces
of
the
severe
illness
he
had
endured
,
but
his
hoary
locks
and
beard
gave
him
a
very
venerable
appearance
.
<EOS>
While
the
warden
and
Mr.
Bourne
were
conversing
with
Colonel
Holland
and
Colonel
Egerton
<EOS>
,
voices
were
heard
singing
a
psalm
,
and
presently
a
large
body
of
men
,
belonging
to
the
town
guard
,
entered
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
Some
of
them
were
provided
with
muskets
,
and
others
armed
with
bills
and
clubs
.
<EOS>
Their
sober
apparel
,
grave
looks
,
and
short
lank
hair
proclaimed
them
Roundheads
.
<EOS>
Their
captain
was
a
stalwart
personage
with
a
very
moody
countenance
.
<EOS>
Over
a
stout
buff
coat
he
wore
a
steel
breast
-
plate
,
and
his
closely
cropped
locks
were
covered
by
a
steel
head
-
piece
.
<EOS>
He
had
pistols
in
his
belt
and
a
long
sword
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
The
name
of
this
individual
,
who
had
been
a
butcher
,
was
Joshua
Cranage
.
<EOS>
He
was
an
Anabaptist
,
and
was
accompanied
by
the
Reverend
Shimrath
Stonehouse
,
a
minister
of
that
sect
,
who
was
very
warlike
in
his
sentiments
.
<EOS>
They
entered
the
churchyard
,
singing
,
Thou
shalt
tread
upon
the
lion
and
the
adder
,
and
when
the
psalm
was
ended
,
and
a
halt
made
,
the
Reverend
Shimrath
addressed
a
few
words
to
the
men
,
and
said:"Fear
not
,
but
fight
valiantly
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
is
on
our
side
,
and
will
lend
us
aid
against
our
enemies
.
<EOS>
They
have
compassed
us
about
,
but
in
the
Lord
's
name
will
we
destroy
them
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
seeing
Colonel
Holland
,
Rosworm
,
and
the
warden
,
Captain
Cranage
marched
up
to
them
,
attended
by
the
Anabaptist
minister
,
and
was
very
well
received
.
<EOS>
As
a
morning
service
was
about
to
take
place
in
the
church
,
the
warden
invited
them
to
attend
it
,
and
no
objection
being
made
by
the
Anabaptist
minister
,
the
whole
party
repaired
to
the
sacred
fabric
followed
by
the
town
guard
.
<EOS>
Already
,
as
it
turned
out
,
a
great
number
of
persons
were
assembled
in
the
church
,
and
to
this
large
congregation
Warden
Heyrick
addressed
a
fiery
discourse
.
<EOS>
Rosworm
,
whose
duties
called
him
to
the
bridge
,
did
not
attend
the
service
,
but
when
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
all
his
men
were
at
their
posts
,
and
that
no
immediate
danger
of
attack
was
to
be
apprehended
,
he
returned
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
service
was
over
,
and
Captain
Cranage
and
his
men
had
marched
on
to
the
Cross
,
where
they
waited
for
orders
.
<EOS>
Thither
Rosworm
followed
with
the
governor
and
Colonel
Egerton
,
and
they
had
scarcely
reached
the
market-
place
,
when
they
learnt
that
a
messenger
had
been
sent
by
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
but
was
detained
by
Captain
Bradshaw
till
Colonel
Holland
's
pleasure
was
known
.
<EOS>
Thereupon
the
governor
mounted
his
horse
,
and
rode
to
the
barricade
at
Deansgate
,
where
he
found
the
messenger
,
who
proved
to
be
Captain
Standish
.
<EOS>
Courteously
saluting
him
,
Colonel
Holland
bade
him
deliver
his
message
,
and
he
would
answer
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
"I
am
sent
by
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
"
replied
Standish
,
"
to
demand
an
immediate
entrance
to
the
town
in
order
that
he
may
take
possession
of
it
,
and
all
the
stores
within
it
,
in
the
king
's
name
.
<EOS>
What
answer
shall
I
deliver
to
his
lordship?""Say
to
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
"
replied
the
other
,
"
that
I
,
Colonel
Richard
Holland
,
Governor
of
Manchester
,
hold
the
town
for
the
Parliament
,
and
peremptorily
refuse
his
lordship
entrance
—
<EOS>
neither
will
I
deliver
it
up
to
him
on
his
insolent
demand
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
this
answer
final
?
<EOS>
"
said
Standish
,
"
or
has
your
excellency
any
further
terms
to
propose
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
I
am
willing
to
submit
them
to
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
who
,
I
may
state
,
is
very
desirous
to
prevent
effusion
of
blood
.
<EOS>
If
the
town
is
quietly
surrendered
,
his
lordship
will
treat
the
inhabitants
kindly
,
but
in
the
event
of
an
obstinate
and
useless
resistance
,
fearful
destruction
will
ensue
.
<EOS>
""I
laugh
at
these
idle
threats
,
"
rejoined
the
governor
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
When
Lord
Derby
learns
that
we
are
fully
prepared
to
withstand
an
attack
,
and
are
certain
to
receive
large
reinforcements
,
he
may
deem
it
prudent
to
withdraw
from
before
the
town
.
<EOS>
""Think
it
not
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
One
more
question
,
and
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
Does
your
excellency
require
any
delay?""None
,
"
replied
the
governor
,
in
a
tone
calculated
to
put
an
end
to
the
interview
.
<EOS>
Standish
was
then
conducted
to
the
barriers
at
the
end
of
Deansgate
by
Captain
Bradshaw
;
and
passing
out
with
the
trooper
who
had
attended
him
,
rode
back
to
Alport
Lodge
,
where
he
found
the
Earl
of
Derby
with
Sir
Alexander
Radcliffe
and
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
governor
refuses
to
surrender
the
town
,
my
lord
,
and
does
not
require
any
time
for
negotiation
,
"
he
cried
,
as
he
sprang
from
the
saddle
,
and
advanced
to
the
earl
.
"Tis
<EOS>
as
I
expected
,
"
said
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
"
But
my
conscience
is
now
easy
.
<EOS>
Let
the
trumpets
at
once
sound
to
the
assault
.
<EOS>
"CHAPTER
<EOS>
XIThe
AssaultIN
obedience
to
the
earl
's
commands
,
the
trumpets
were
then
blown
,
and
the
battery
facing
Deans
-
gate
immediately
opened
fire
.
<EOS>
The
cannonade
was
continued
for
some
time
;
but
no
material
damage
was
done
,
nor
were
the
defenders
driven
from
their
position
.
<EOS>
An
attempt
was
next
made
by
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
with
a
party
of
horse
to
force
the
barricade
,
but
it
proved
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bradshaw
reserved
his
fire
till
the
assailants
were
within
a
short
distance
of
the
barrier
.
<EOS>
He
then
poured
a
sharp
volley
upon
them
,
by
which
several
men
were
wounded
and
unhorsed
,
and
the
rest
turned
back
.
<EOS>
Another
attack
was
made
by
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
against
the
barrier
at
the
end
of
Market
-
street
Lane
,
and
was
successfully
resisted
by
Captain
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
Several
fruitless
attempts
were
likewise
made
to
scale
the
ramparts
,
but
in
every
instance
the
assailants
were
repulsed
.
<EOS>
Simultaneously
with
these
attacks
on
the
barriers
and
walls
,
a
very
vigorous
and
determined
effort
was
made
by
Lord
Molineux
and
Sir
John
Girlington
to
force
the
defences
of
the
bridge
;
but
Colonel
Rosworm
with
his
musketeers
kept
up
such
a
constant
fire
upon
them
from
the
walls
of
the
churchyard
,
that
they
could
not
advance
.
<EOS>
The
small
piece
of
ordnance
planted
by
Rosworm
on
Smithy
Bank
did
considerable
execution
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
the
marksmen
posted
on
the
church-
tower
rendered
good
service
.
<EOS>
Thus
far
fortune
had
favoured
the
besieged
,
who
were
in
high
spirits
at
their
success
,
and
many
of
the
religious
enthusiasts
firmly
believed
that
Heaven
fought
on
their
side
.
<EOS>
This
notion
was
encouraged
by
their
ministers
.
<EOS>
The
Reverend
Shimrath
Stonehouse
called
out
with
a
loud
voice:"Go
on
courageously
.
<EOS>
Through
the
name
of
the
Lord
,
we
shall
destroy
them
.
<EOS>
They
fall
down
flat
,
but
we
do
rise
and
stand
up
steadfastly
through
the
Lord
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
appearance
of
the
besieged
town
was
very
singular
and
totally
different
from
its
ordinary
aspect
.
<EOS>
Very
little
business
was
done
,
most
of
the
shops
being
closed
as
on
the
Sabbath
,
but
all
the
taverns
were
open
and
full
of
customers
,
and
a
good
deal
of
ale
and
wine
was
consumed
.
<EOS>
All
classes
were
full
of
warlike
excitement
,
and
breathed
vengeance
against
the
malignants
and
Papists
,
whom
they
coupled
together
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
Puritans
and
Roundheads
,
who
could
everywhere
be
distinguished
by
their
cropped
hair
,
tall
hats
,
and
sober
habiliments
,
were
armed
in
one
way
or
other
—
some
with
muskets
and
pistols
—
some
with
swords
,
and
others
with
pikes
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
evident
they
were
all
earnest
in
the
cause
—
all
ready
and
eager
to
fight
.
<EOS>
Crowds
assembled
in
the
market
-
place
,
where
psalms
were
sung
,
or
gathered
round
the
Cross
to
listen
to
the
Reverend
Shimrath
Stonehouse
.
<EOS>
A
multitude
of
strangers
were
now
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
Several
gentlemen
,
residing
in
the
neighbourhood
,
staunch
adherents
of
the
Parliament
,
had
come
to
the
assistance
of
the
place
,
and
brought
with
them
their
armed
retainers
.
<EOS>
These
with
the
militia
,
which
mustered
some
four
or
five
hundred
,
amounted
in
all
to
nearly
two
thousand
men
.
<EOS>
The
country
people
were
animated
by
the
same
strong
religious
feeling
as
the
townsfolk
,
and
had
the
same
hatred
of
the
malignants
and
Papists
.
<EOS>
It
was
this
religious
feeling
that
made
Manchester
so
strong
,
because
it
bound
together
all
classes
of
the
community
.
<EOS>
A
few
of
the
inhabitants
continued
loyal
and
well
disposed
towards
the
king
,
but
being
in
<EOS>
so
great
a
minority
<EOS>
,
they
did
not
dare
to
show
themselves
.
<EOS>
Hoping
and
praying
the
Earl
of
Derby
might
be
successful
and
subdue
the
town
,
they
meant
to
rise
to
his
assistance
,
as
soon
as
they
could
do
so
with
safety
.
<EOS>
To
those
who
really
believe
themselves
under
the
protection
of
Heaven
nothing
can
cause
alarm
;
and
even
when
cannon
shot
was
falling
in
the
streets
,
or
demolishing
houses
,
no
misgiving
was
felt
by
the
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
soldiers
,
the
preachers
were
with
them
everywhere
—
on
the
walls
—
at
the
gates
—
exposing
themselves
to
the
fire
of
the
enemy
—
solacing
the
wounded
—
cheering
on
their
friends
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
zeal
confined
to
sectarian
ministers
,
for
Warden
Heyrick
,
Mr.
Bourne
,
and
their
chaplains
were
equally
zealous
.
<EOS>
Above
all
,
the
greatest
reliance
was
placed
on
Rosworm
,
who
was
looked
upon
as
the
chief
defender
of
the
town
,
and
since
he
escaped
all
injury
,
it
was
thought
he
was
under
the
special
protection
of
Heaven
.
<EOS>
Throughout
the
siege
,
the
inhabitants
continued
their
religious
meetings
,
their
public
preachings
in
the
market
-
place
,
at
the
Cross
,
and
elsewhere
—
their
constant
psalm
-
singing
.
<EOS>
Every
one
lent
aid
,
fearing
to
be
treated
as
a
malignant
if
he
stayed
at
home
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
employed
themselves
in
casting
bullets
,
and
preparing
matches
for
firelocks
.
<EOS>
Gentlewomen
rendered
all
the
assistance
in
their
power
,
and
brought
meat
and
drink
for
the
soldiers
.
<EOS>
When
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
and
his
dragoons
were
driven
back
from
Deansgate
by
Captain
Bradshaw
—
when
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
was
repulsed
by
Captain
Radcliffe
—
there
was
great
rejoicing
among
the
saints
,
and
their
confidence
,
shaken
for
the
moment
,
was
fully
restored
.
<EOS>
When
Lord
Molineux
and
Sir
John
Girlington
were
determined
to
pass
the
bridge
,
and
were
driven
back
by
the
marksmen
on
the
walls
of
the
churchyard
,
there
was
again
great
rejoicing
among
the
saints
,
and
Rosworm
was
hailed
as
their
deliverer
.
<EOS>
Shouts
of
triumph
everywhere
resounded
throughout
the
town
,
and
hymns
were
sung
,
but
Rosworm
was
not
to
be
deceived
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
some
successes
had
been
gained
,
but
he
knew
that
far
more
must
be
done
,
ere
the
town
could
be
effectually
delivered
from
its
powerful
foe
.
<EOS>
Once
more
he
ascended
the
church
-
tower
to
see
how
matters
stood
.
<EOS>
On
looking
towards
Alport
Lodge
,
he
could
easily
perceive
that
preparations
for
a
general
assault
were
being
actively
made
.
<EOS>
For
the
moment
the
artillerymen
at
the
battery
had
ceased
firing
,
but
it
was
evident
they
would
recommence
very
shortly
.
<EOS>
In
Salford
it
was
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
There
the
besiegers
were
preparing
for
a
fresh
attack
.
<EOS>
Having
obtained
possession
of
a
couple
of
houses
at
the
foot
of
the
bridge
that
afforded
them
shelter
,
they
could
cover
the
advance
of
the
assailing
party
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
designs
of
the
Earl
of
Derby
became
manifest
.
<EOS>
Determined
not
to
be
baffled
,
he
sent
off
a
party
of
men
under
the
command
of
Captain
Windebank
to
set
fire
to
two
large
barns
standing
at
no
great
distance
from
the
walls
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
another
party
was
despatched
to
set
fire
to
eight
or
ten
houses
at
the
end
of
Deansgate
.
<EOS>
This
was
done
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
besieged
to
prevent
it
,
and
the
houses
soon
burst
into
flames
.
<EOS>
As
the
wind
was
blowing
at
the
time
from
the
south
-
west
,
the
flames
and
smoke
were
driven
upon
Bradshaw
and
his
men
,
and
almost
blinded
them
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
it
was
feared
that
the
conflagration
would
extend
to
the
town
,
and
such
would
undoubtedly
have
been
the
case
,
had
not
the
wind
suddenly
changed
—
a
circumstance
not
unnaturally
regarded
as
a
special
providence
.
<EOS>
While
the
fire
was
raging
,
a
large
party
of
Royalists
,
under
the
command
of
Sir
Gilbert
Gerard
,
made
another
attempt
to
enter
the
town
,
but
were
baffled
by
the
bravery
of
Captain
Bradshaw
and
his
men
,
supported
by
a
band
of
musketeers
sent
to
their
assistance
by
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
After
a
sharp
encounter
the
Royalists
were
driven
back
with
considerable
loss
.
<EOS>
No
further
attack
was
made
at
the
time
on
the
barrier
and
walls
,
but
the
besiegers
having
possessed
themselves
of
a
house
at
the
foot
of
the
bridge
,
as
previously
stated
,
kept
up
a
constant
fire
throughout
the
night
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XIICaptain
CranageIN
the
conflict
at
the
barrier
in
Deansgate
,
Frank
Standish
,
who
accompanied
Sir
Gilbert
Gerard
,
had
his
horse
shot
under
him
,
and
while
on
the
ground
received
a
thrust
from
a
pike
in
the
arm
,
that
prevented
him
from
using
his
sword
,
and
he
was
therefore
obliged
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
Taken
to
the
college
,
where
his
wound
was
dressed
,
he
was
still
in
the
surgeon
's
hands
,
when
Rosworm
came
into
the
room
with
some
other
prisoners
,
and
recognising
him
,
asked
if
he
was
badly
hurt
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
much
,
"
replied
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
look
very
faint
,
"
said
the
engineer
.
<EOS>
"
My
house
is
close
by
;
go
there
and
get
a
cup
of
wine
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
will
attend
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
return
shortly
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
answerable
for
him
,
"
he
added
to
the
guard
.
<EOS>
This
was
enough
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
surgeon
had
finished
his
task
,
Standish
was
allowed
to
depart
,
and
at
once
repaired
to
Rosworm
's
dwelling
.
<EOS>
He
found
Gertrude
in
the
houseplace
,
examining
a
musket
,
which
she
had
been
cleaning
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
greatly
surprised
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
told
her
he
was
a
prisoner
and
wounded
,
and
added
that
her
father
had
sent
him
to
the
house
to
be
cared
for
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
that
case
you
are
welcome
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
I
pray
you
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
gladly
complied
,
and
opening
a
cupboard
,
she
filled
a
drinking
-
cup
with
wine
and
set
it
before
him
.
<EOS>
"You
have
been
unlucky
,
"
she
remarked
,
as
he
emptied
the
cup
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
lord
has
not
found
it
so
easy
to
take
the
town
as
he
expected
.
<EOS>
""No
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
The
inhabitants
may
thank
your
father
for
the
defence
they
have
been
able
to
make
.
<EOS>
Had
he
not
been
here
to
aid
the
rebels
,
Lord
Derby
would
now
be
master
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
But
I
see
you
have
just
laid
down
a
musket
.
<EOS>
Have
you
used
it?""Not
yet
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
will
not
allow
me
to
go
forth
,
or
I
should
have
done
.
<EOS>
""He
is
quite
right
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
better
at
home
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
think
so
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
hear
the
thunder
of
the
cannon
or
the
rattle
of
musketry
without
longing
to
mix
in
the
fray
.
<EOS>
Where
were
you
wounded?""In
an
attack
on
the
Deansgate
barrier
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
My
horse
was
shot
under
me
,
and
I
received
a
thrust
from
a
pike
ere
I
could
rise
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
I
thought
all
was
over
with
me
.
<EOS>
""Would
<EOS>
I
had
been
there
to
help
you
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"I
wish
you
had
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
met
with
bad
usage
.
<EOS>
Although
I
had
surrendered
,
the
leader
of
the
town
-
guard
,
Captain
Cranage
,
would
have
cut
me
down
,
if
Captain
Bradshaw
had
not
prevented
him
.
<EOS>
""That
was
a
base
act
,
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
these
Roundheads
,
but
their
cause
is
just
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
mistake
,
"
cried
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Their
cause
is
not
just
.
<EOS>
They
are
rebels
,
and
have
thrown
the
whole
kingdom
into
confusion
.
<EOS>
It
grieves
me
to
think
that
your
father
has
joined
with
them
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
there
the
psalm
-
singing
knaves
are
at
work
again
,
"
he
added
,
as
voices
were
heard
outside
singing
a
hymn
.
<EOS>
As
the
hymn
ceased
,
the
door
opened
,
and
the
stalwart
figure
of
Captain
Cranage
was
seen
.
<EOS>
"That
is
the
man
who
would
have
slain
me
when
I
had
surrendered
,
"
remarked
Standish
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
do
I
behold
?
"
cried
Cranage
.
"
<EOS>
Has
a
Papist
and
a
malignant
taken
refuge
here
.
<EOS>
My
men
shall
drag
him
forth
,
and
put
him
to
death
.
<EOS>
""I
will
resist
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Standish
,
springing
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
Then
recollecting
that
he
was
disabled
,
and
without
a
sword
,
he
looked
confounded
.
<EOS>
"He
must
not
be
molested
,
"
interposed
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
has
sent
him
.
<EOS>
""This
is
the
second
time
since
I
have
surrendered
that
you
have
threatened
to
take
my
life
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
prisoner
on
parole
.
<EOS>
""Thou
<EOS>
hast
richly
deserved
death
,
"
said
Cranage
;
"
and
had
I
been
in
command
at
the
Deansgate
barrier
,
thou
shouldst
have
died
.
<EOS>
Thou
wert
present
when
the
houses
were
set
on
fire
.
<EOS>
""What
of
that
?
"
cried
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"
The
men
had
received
their
orders
from
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
Did
you
think
this
officer
would
prevent
them?""I
<EOS>
know
not
,
"
said
Cranage
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
since
you
plead
for
him
,
fair
damsel
,
I
will
spare
him
.
<EOS>
""I
would
not
owe
my
life
to
thee
,
"
said
Standish
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
you
take
him
hence
,
you
will
greatly
offend
my
father
,
"
remarked
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"Then
I
will
abide
his
coming
,
"
said
Cranage
,
seating
himself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Give
me
a
cup
of
wine
,
I
pray
you
,
fair
damsel
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
much
hard
work
,
and
would
fain
recruit
my
forces
.
"Gertrude
<EOS>
again
repaired
to
the
cupboard
and
set
a
flask
before
him
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
drink
to
your
health
,
fair
damsel
,
"
he
said
,
eyeing
her
tenderly
as
he
filled
his
glass
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
aware
that
we
have
gained
a
complete
victory
over
the
malignants
.
<EOS>
We
have
beaten
them
off
in
every
attack
,
and
their
cannon
have
not
done
us
any
hurt
.
<EOS>
""It
is
not
well
to
exult
,
"
said
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
fight
is
not
over
yet
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
Lord
is
with
us
,
therefore
we
can
not
fail
,
"
said
Cranage
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ere
many
days
,
the
town
will
be
delivered
from
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
""Should
<EOS>
it
be
so
<EOS>
,
it
will
have
been
preserved
by
Colonel
Rosworm
alone
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
him
the
entire
credit
of
the
defence
is
due
.
<EOS>
""Humph
!
"
exclaimed
Cranage
.
<EOS>
"
Methinks
we
have
done
our
part
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
was
proceeding
with
some
further
self
-
laudation
,
when
Rosworm
himself
came
in
,
accompanied
by
Colonel
Holland
.
<EOS>
Standish
bowed
to
the
governor
,
who
courteously
returned
the
salutation
.
<EOS>
"I
have
some
intelligence
that
will
be
satisfactory
to
you
,
Captain
Standish
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
Earl
of
Derby
has
just
sent
an
officer
to
propose
an
exchange
of
prisoners
.
<EOS>
I
have
agreed
to
the
proposition
.
<EOS>
You
will
,
therefore
,
be
exchanged
for
Captain
Booth
,
who
was
captured
in
a
sally
that
he
made
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"I
rejoice
to
hear
it
,
colonel
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
very
well
treated
since
I
have
fallen
into
your
hands
—
still
I
shall
be
glad
to
get
back
.
<EOS>
""You
will
be
able
to
inform
Lord
Derby
as
to
our
condition
,
"
said
the
governor
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
shall
give
his
lordship
a
correct
report
,
rest
assured
,
colonel
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"That
is
all
I
desire
,
"
said
the
governor
.
"
<EOS>
Captain
Cranage
,
"
he
continued
,
turning
to
that
personage
,
who
had
risen
on
his
entrance
,
"
I
notice
that
you
have
a
small
party
of
men
outside
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
have
,
colonel
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
any
orders?""Conduct
Captain
Standish
to
the
Deansgate
barrier
,
where
he
will
be
exchanged
for
Captain
Booth
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
his
sword
must
be
restored
to
him
.
<EOS>
""It
shall
be
done
,
colonel
,
"
replied
Cranage
.
<EOS>
"
Come
with
me
,
sir
,
"
he
added
to
Standish
.
<EOS>
"Adieu
<EOS>
,
captain
,
"
said
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
had
a
long
captivity
to
endure
.
<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
has
it
been
disagreeable
,
"
replied
Standish
,
glancing
at
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
much
beholden
both
to
you
and
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
"Formally
<EOS>
saluting
the
governor
,
and
bowing
to
Rosworm
and
Gertrude
,
he
went
forth
with
Cranage
,
who
did
not
like
the
task
imposed
upon
him
,
but
could
not
decline
it
.
<EOS>
Many
a
scowling
look
was
fixed
upon
Standish
as
he
passed
through
the
streets
with
his
guard
,
and
many
a
deep
malediction
reached
his
ear
.
<EOS>
As
usual
,
crowds
were
collected
in
the
marketplace
,
singing
hymns
,
or
listening
to
preachers
.
<EOS>
The
triumphant
looks
of
these
persons
showed
they
were
exulting
in
their
success
.
<EOS>
As
the
firing
from
the
enemy
's
battery
had
ceased
,
Deansgate
was
full
of
soldiers
,
but
they
readily
made
way
for
Cranage
and
his
party
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
the
barrier
,
they
found
Captain
Bradshaw
,
with
a
guard
drawn
up
beside
him
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
the
guard
were
half
a
dozen
Royalists
—
officers
and
men
.
<EOS>
On
the
further
side
of
the
barrier
was
Captain
Windebank
,
on
horseback
,
attended
by
a
small
party
of
dragoons
.
<EOS>
He
had
brought
Captain
Booth
and
Captain
Hyde
,
with
five
Parliamentary
soldiers
to
be
exchanged
.
<EOS>
All
the
prisoners
on
either
side
being
now
assembled
,
the
exchange
was
promptly
effected
.
<EOS>
The
Republican
officers
and
men
were
welcomed
with
shouts
,
while
the
Royalists
,
attended
by
the
escort
,
marched
on
to
the
battery
,
where
they
were
greeted
in
like
manner
by
the
artillerymen
.
<EOS>
Here
Standish
received
Captain
Windebank
's
hearty
congratulations
on
his
release
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XIIIRosworm
proposes
to
burn
Alport
LodgeAFTER
Standish
had
been
taken
away
,
Colonel
Holland
and
Rosworm
continued
for
a
short
time
in
consultation
.
<EOS>
Since
they
did
not
retire
to
the
inner
room
,
but
remained
in
the
houseplace
,
Gertrude
,
who
was
occupied
in
some
household
matters
,
necessarily
overheard
their
discourse
.
<EOS>
"I
fear
our
ammunition
may
run
short
,
"
said
the
governor
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
not
more
powder
than
will
suffice
for
to
-
morrow
,
and
the
match
is
nearly
exhausted
.
<EOS>
""We
must
obtain
a
fresh
supply
of
both
from
the
enemy
,
"
replied
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
That
must
be
the
main
object
of
the
sally
to
be
made
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
We
may
not
be
able
to
carry
off
any
of
the
cannon
from
the
battery
,
but
we
can
secure
some
powder
and
match
.
<EOS>
""That
will
be
a
great
help
to
us
,
"
said
the
governor
.
<EOS>
"
The
supplies
we
expected
from
An
-
coats
Hall
have
been
cut
off
.
<EOS>
""Hitherto
<EOS>
we
have
done
well
,
"
said
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
to
-
morrow
,
our
good
fortune
may
desert
us
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
trust
not
,
"
said
Colonel
Holland
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
wherefore
these
misgivings?""I
have
no
misgivings
,
"
replied
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
confident
as
ever
.
<EOS>
But
I
feel
certain
the
Earl
of
Derby
meditates
a
grand
attack
,
and
most
probably
will
put
his
plan
in
execution
to
-
morrow
—
if
he
be
not
prevented
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
can
we
prevent
him
?
"
asked
Colonel
Holland
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
striking
a
heavy
blow
to
-
night
,
"
replied
Rosworm
.
"
<EOS>
He
tried
to
burn
down
the
town
.
<EOS>
We
must
retaliate
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
not
propose
to
set
fire
to
Salford
?
"
cried
the
governor
.
<EOS>
"
Such
a
step
would
be
highly
prejudicial
to
our
cause
.
<EOS>
We
have
many
partisans
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
""No
,
I
do
not
design
to
fire
Salford
,
"
said
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
I
propose
to
attack
the
earl
in
his
head
-
quarters
,
and
burn
down
Alport
Lodge
.
<EOS>
""That
would
be
a
heavy
blow
,
indeed
,
"
rejoined
the
governor
.
"
<EOS>
But
a
courageous
man
is
needed
to
strike
it
.
<EOS>
""Captain
<EOS>
Bradshaw
is
the
man
,
"
said
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
execute
the
project
myself
,
but
I
can
not
quit
my
post
.
<EOS>
This
is
my
plan
:
A
sortie
must
take
place
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
The
night
will
be
dark
,
so
that
it
will
favour
the
design
.
<EOS>
Bradshaw
must
sally
forth
with
a
party
of
fifty
men
,
and
make
his
way
,
as
best
he
can
,
to
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
He
may
not
succeed
in
passing
the
sentinels
unobserved
,
but
he
must
try
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Should
he
reach
the
house
,
he
must
throw
combustibles
into
it
and
into
the
out
-
buildings
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
must
hurry
back
to
attack
the
battery
and
seize
upon
the
ammunition
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
he
may
want
aid
in
this
bold
attempt
,
"
observed
the
governor
.
<EOS>
"True
,
"
replied
Rosworm
.
"
<EOS>
Captain
Radcliffe
and
Captain
Booth
must
hold
themselves
in
readiness
;
and
as
soon
as
they
perceive
that
Alport
Lodge
is
on
fire
,
must
sally
forth
—
each
with
a
party
of
fifty
men
—
and
make
for
the
battery
,
to
render
aid
in
case
of
need
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
plan
is
excellent
,
and
can
not
fail
,
"
said
Colonel
Holland
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
at
once
,
and
give
the
necessary
orders
to
Bradshaw
and
the
others
.
<EOS>
""Impress
upon
them
the
necessity
of
caution
,
"
observed
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
If
the
plan
is
betrayed
it
is
ruined
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
imprudence
need
be
feared
on
their
part
,
"
said
Colonel
Holland
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
have
to
consult
with
you
again
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
find
you
here?""You
will
find
me
in
the
churchyard
,
with
the
marksmen
,
"
replied
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
The
governor
then
departed
on
his
errand
.
<EOS>
"Give
me
<EOS>
a
cup
of
wine
,
child
,
"
said
Rosworm
to
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"Father
,
"
said
Gertrude
,
as
she
brought
him
the
wine
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
witness
this
nocturnal
sortie
.
<EOS>
""Thou
<EOS>
may'st
see
it
from
the
church
-
tower
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
there
will
be
nothing
visible
till
the
hall
is
fired
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
mean
I
should
like
to
go
with
Captain
Bradshaw
's
party
,
"
she
remarked
.
<EOS>
"Nonsense
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
They
will
run
great
risk
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
care
for
the
risk
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
me
accompany
them
.
<EOS>
""Thou
<EOS>
art
mad
to
make
such
a
foolish
request
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
I
am
quite
serious
,
father!""Then
<EOS>
I
should
be
more
mad
to
grant
it
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"I
will
put
on
male
attire
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
doublet
that
would
fit
me
,
and
you
yourself
have
taught
me
how
to
fire
a
pistol
,
and
use
a
sword
.
<EOS>
""But
I
never
meant
thee
to
join
in
a
midnight
sortie
,
"
he
cried
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
Dismiss
the
notion
at
once
.
<EOS>
""I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
go
,
father
,
"
she
rejoined
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
know
I
am
very
self
-
willed
.
<EOS>
""Bah
!
<EOS>
thou
art
only
jesting
.
<EOS>
If
I
thought
you
were
in
earnest
,
I
would
lock
you
in
your
chamber
.
<EOS>
""That
would
n't
prevent
me
from
going
,
"
she
exclaimed
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
easily
get
out
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
""Enough
of
this
,
"
he
cried
,
rising
from
his
seat
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
too
well
to
believe
you
capable
of
such
folly
.
<EOS>
Do
as
you
will
,
I
shall
not
control
you
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
give
your
consent?""Assuredly
not
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
really
curious
to
witness
the
sortie
,
you
can
accompany
me
when
I
make
my
rounds
.
<EOS>
But
I
ought
to
mention
that
a
great
thanksgiving
meeting
will
be
held
at
the
church
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Thou
hadst
best
attend
it
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
will
—
<EOS>
but
I
must
not
lose
the
sortie
.
<EOS>
""Well
!
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
thou
art
wilful
,
and
must
be
humoured
.
<EOS>
Go
to
the
Trafford
Chapel
—
on
the
south
side
of
the
nave
—
thou
know'st
<EOS>
it
—
I
will
come
to
thee
there
.
<EOS>
""At
<EOS>
what
hour
does
<EOS>
the
service
commence?""Not
till
late
—
<EOS>
but
it
will
be
over
long
before
midnight
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"That
is
all
I
wanted
to
know
,
"
she
returned
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
me
in
the
Trafford
Chapel
.
<EOS>
"Her
<EOS>
father
looked
as
if
he
had
something
more
to
say
by
way
of
caution
,
but
he
left
it
unsaid
,
and
kissing
her
on
the
brow
,
took
up
his
musket
,
and
went
forth
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
was
he
gone
than
Gertrude
went
to
the
door
of
the
kitchen
,
which
was
situated
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
and
called
out:"Justine
—
come
here
—
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
summons
was
immediately
answered
by
an
elderly
and
decently
attired
woman
,
who
acted
as
Rosworm
's
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
"What
think
you
,
Justine
?
"
cried
Gertrude
,
clapping
her
hands
with
delight
.
<EOS>
"
At
length
,
I
have
my
wish
.
<EOS>
My
father
has
promised
to
take
me
with
him
to
see
the
sortie
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
not
to
let
you
join
it
,
"
remarked
Justine
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
,
but
I
may
do
so
,
for
all
that
,
"
said
Gertrude
,
with
a
singular
look
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
hope
not
,
"
observed
the
housekeeper
,
in
a
severe
tone
.
<EOS>
"
You
quite
astound
me
!
<EOS>
A
young
damsel
join
a
midnight
sortie
—
I
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
Why
,
you
are
certain
to
be
killed
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
till
I
have
killed
half
a
dozen
of
the
enemy
,
Justine
.
<EOS>
""Then
,
indeed
,
you
would
deserve
to
be
shot
.
<EOS>
But
I
know
your
good
father
wo
n't
allow
you
to
expose
yourself
to
any
such
risk
.
<EOS>
""We
shall
see
,
Justine
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
put
on
my
military
dress
.
<EOS>
""That
dress
has
put
this
whim
in
your
head
,
"
observed
Justine
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
mischief
would
come
of
it
,
when
your
father
gave
it
you
.
<EOS>
But
he
meant
it
to
serve
for
a
different
purpose
.
<EOS>
""He
meant
me
to
wear
it
,
or
he
would
never
have
given
it
me
,
Justine
—
<EOS>
and
so
I
will
—
<EOS>
this
very
night
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
Heaven
protect
you
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
housekeeper
,
with
a
groan
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
is
vain
to
reason
with
you
.
"And
<EOS>
she
returned
to
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
Gertrude
looked
irresolute
.
<EOS>
She
then
went
up
-
stairs
to
her
own
room
,
and
opened
a
chest
that
contained
some
martial
equipments
—
buff
jerkin
,
baldrick
,
boots
,
and
head-
piece
—
all
of
light
make
,
and
small
size
.
<EOS>
She
knew
they
would
fit
her
,
for
she
had
often
tried
them
on
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
these
accoutrements
decided
her
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
XIVThe
Nocturnal
<EOS>
ThanksgivingTHAT
night
the
interior
of
the
fine
old
Collegiate
Church
presented
a
most
singular
spectacle
.
<EOS>
The
broad
nave
and
aisles
were
filled
with
armed
men
,
for
all
who
came
thither
to
offer
thanksgiving
had
brought
their
weapons
with
them
—
muskets
,
pikes
,
and
halberts
.
<EOS>
The
place
was
imperfectly
lighted
,
but
the
gloom
heightened
the
effect
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
A
lamp
fixed
here
and
there
against
the
pillars
partially
illumined
the
aisles
,
and
revealed
the
stern
visages
of
those
grouped
around
.
<EOS>
The
majority
of
the
congregation
were
Presbyterians
,
but
there
were
a
great
number
of
Round
-
heads
present
,
easily
distinguishable
by
their
habiliments
,
and
sour
looks
.
<EOS>
These
belonged
to
various
sects
,
but
they
had
come
together
on
that
night
,
which
had
been
appointed
for
a
general
thanksgiving
.
<EOS>
Differences
there
might
be
among
them
on
certain
religious
points
,
but
they
were
all
united
against
the
common
enemy
—
they
were
all
violently
opposed
to
the
malignants
and
Papists
.
<EOS>
Among
the
assemblage
thronging
the
nave
were
a
large
number
of
the
militia
,
and
several
of
their
officers
were
with
them
.
<EOS>
All
the
town
guards
—
except
those
on
duty
—
were
present
—
Captain
Cranage
being
conspicuous
among
them
.
<EOS>
Every
portion
of
the
sacred
structure
was
invaded
—
the
chapels
were
full
,
the
choir
was
as
crowded
as
the
nave
,
and
the
stalls
were
occupied
by
the
fiercest
enemies
of
the
Established
Church
,
who
would
gladly
have
destroyed
them
.
<EOS>
The
service
commenced
with
the
psalm
—
O
Lord
,
arise
,
and
scatter
thine
enemies
—
and
from
the
many
earnest
voices
that
joined
in
it
,
a
fine
effect
was
produced
,
but
the
sacred
song
lost
much
of
its
solemnity
,
since
no
organ
accompanied
it
.
<EOS>
The
noble
instrument
which
,
until
lately
,
had
resounded
in
the
church
,
its
strains
rolling
along
the
roof
,
and
filling
every
part
of
the
pile
,
had
been
silenced
by
the
rigorous
Puritans
.
<EOS>
Amid
the
deep
silence
that
followed
the
cessation
of
the
singing
,
the
impressive
accents
of
Mr.
Bourne
were
heard
reading
prayers
,
and
the
venerable
figure
of
the
divine
could
be
seen
in
the
pulpit
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Bourne
was
listened
to
with
the
greatest
attention
,
and
when
he
had
finished
reading
,
another
hymn
was
sung
by
the
whole
congregation
.
<EOS>
Then
followed
a
fiery
sermon
by
Warden
Heyrick
,
that
excited
his
hearers
to
the
highest
point
,
as
was
shown
by
the
agitation
pervading
them
.
<EOS>
The
warden
had
just
ceased
,
when
Rosworm
entered
the
sacred
edifice
from
the
south
porch
,
and
made
his
way
as
quickly
as
he
could
along
the
crowded
aisle
to
the
Trafford
Chapel
.
<EOS>
Here
,
among
a
number
of
armed
men
,
he
perceived
a
youthful
soldier
,
accoutred
in
a
buff
coat
and
steel
head
-
piece
,
and
holding
a
musket
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
The
features
of
this
youth
,
so
far
as
they
could
be
discerned
,
were
almost
feminine
,
and
his
figure
looked
too
slight
for
the
martial
task
he
had
undertaken
.
<EOS>
Still
,
he
seemed
full
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
On
receiving
a
sign
from
Rosworm
he
left
the
corner
where
he
was
standing
,
and
joined
him
,
and
they
quitted
the
church
together
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
moon
,
but
the
night
was
clear
,
and
the
stars
shining
brightly
.
<EOS>
Rosworm
led
his
young
companion
across
the
churchyard
towards
the
low
stone
wall
that
overlooked
the
river
.
<EOS>
Here
were
the
best
marksmen
,
and
occasionally
a
shot
was
fired
.
<EOS>
On
looking
from
the
wall
the
dark
outline
of
the
bridge
could
be
discerned
,
and
the
river
glimmered
as
they
approached
it
.
<EOS>
The
besiegers
,
as
already
mentioned
,
had
now
taken
possession
of
a
house
at
the
foot
of
the
bridge
,
and
kept
up
a
constant
fire
against
the
guard
at
the
barrier
,
but
without
doing
much
damage
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
with
this
inspection
,
Rosworm
retraced
his
steps
.
<EOS>
The
service
was
not
yet
over
in
the
church
,
and
the
lights
gleaming
from
the
painted
windows
of
the
massive
pile
produced
a
very
striking
effect
.
<EOS>
"Thou
hadst
best
go
home
,
"
said
Rosworm
,
to
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
about
to
mount
the
tower
.
<EOS>
Thou
wilt
find
the
ascent
fatiguing
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
Gertrude
would
not
be
dissuaded
,
and
entering
by
a
low
door
at
which
a
sentinel
was
stationed
,
they
began
to
mount
a
circular
stone
staircase
,
that
brought
them
to
the
belfry
.
<EOS>
A
small
lamp
here
and
<EOS>
there
fixed
against
the
walls
<EOS>
showed
them
the
way
.
<EOS>
The
scene
in
the
belfry
was
exceedingly
curious
,
the
place
being
filled
with
musketeers
,
several
of
whom
were
seated
on
benches
,
and
making
a
hearty
supper
of
cold
meat
and
bread
.
<EOS>
The
room
was
lighted
up
by
a
couple
of
lamps
.
<EOS>
Telling
the
men
not
to
disturb
themselves
,
Rosworm
mounted
with
his
daughter
to
the
summit
of
the
tower
.
<EOS>
Only
a
couple
of
musketeers
were
on
the
watch
,
but
the
others
could
be
instantly
summoned
,
if
required
.
<EOS>
From
this
elevated
position
,
of
course
,
the
bridge
could
be
discerned
through
the
gloom
,
and
the
firing
of
the
besiegers
distinctly
seen
and
heard
.
<EOS>
Looking
towards
the
town
,
the
buildings
and
fortifications
could
be
imperfectly
distinguished
,
but
nothing
was
visible
beyond
the
walls
.
<EOS>
After
contemplating
this
curious
prospect
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
pointing
out
the
different
barriers
to
his
daughter
,
Rosworm
bade
the
musketeers
keep
strict
watch
,
and
telling
them
he
should
return
as
soon
as
he
had
made
his
rounds
,
he
descended
with
Gertrude
to
the
belfry
,
and
thence
to
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
The
congregation
were
then
issuing
from
the
church
,
but
Rosworm
hurried
on
with
Gertrude
through
the
dark
and
silent
streets
,
through
the
now
deserted
market
-
place
,
and
halted
not
till
they
reached
the
walls
.
<EOS>
Everywhere
the
sentinels
were
at
their
posts
.
<EOS>
Turning
off
on
the
right
,
Rosworm
next
bent
his
course
towards
Deansgate
,
but
halted
before
he
got
to
the
barrier
.
<EOS>
The
post
he
had
chosen
commanded
the
end
of
the
street
,
and
looked
towards
Alport
Lodge
.
<EOS>
All
was
buried
in
obscurity
in
that
direction
,
and
the
mansion
was
quite
undistinguishable
.
<EOS>
"You
will
be
able
to
witness
the
sortie
from
this
point
,
"
said
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
leave
you
for
a
short
time
,
but
you
will
be
perfectly
safe
here
.
<EOS>
Do
not
quit
the
spot
on
any
account
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
committing
her
to
the
care
of
a
sentinel
,
he
moved
off
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XVThe
SortieQUARTER
of
an
hour
elapsed
,
and
Gertrude
began
to
feel
uneasy
,
but
the
sentinel
reassured
her
,
and
shortly
afterwards
,
while
looking
towards
the
park
,
she
discerned
a
number
of
armed
men
issue
from
the
gate
,
and
move
stealthily
and
silently
towards
Alport
Lodge
.
<EOS>
Feeling
certain
this
must
be
Captain
Bradshaw
and
his
party
,
she
would
fain
have
joined
them
,
but
the
sentinel
would
not
let
her
stir
.
<EOS>
The
party
quickly
disappeared
in
the
gloom
,
and
for
a
few
minutes
all
continued
quiet
.
<EOS>
A
loud
discharge
of
musketry
then
broke
the
stillness
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
a
bright
light
showed
that
the
party
had
succeeded
in
setting
Alport
Lodge
on
fire
.
<EOS>
Whatever
efforts
were
made
to
extinguish
the
conflagration
proved
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
Built
almost
entirely
of
timber
,
the
old
hall
burnt
with
the
greatest
rapidity
.
<EOS>
By
this
light
the
Royalist
soldiers
and
their
leaders
could
be
seen
actively
,
but
unavailingly
employed
in
trying
to
save
the
mansion
from
the
entire
destruction
that
threatened
it
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Bradshaw
and
his
party
having
successfully
accomplished
their
purpose
without
any
loss
,
hurried
back
as
fast
as
they
could
,
and
acting
upon
Rosworm
's
instructions
,
made
an
attack
upon
the
battery
.
<EOS>
But
being
hotly
pursued
by
a
company
of
dragoons
headed
by
Frank
Standish
,
they
were
compelled
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
,
and
several
of
them
were
cut
down
,
or
made
prisoners
before
they
could
reach
the
barrier
at
the
end
of
Deansgate
.
<EOS>
Standish
attempted
to
follow
them
,
but
was
driven
back
.
<EOS>
Resolved
,
however
,
to
gain
an
entrance
at
some
other
point
,
he
rode
further
on
,
and
then
dismounting
with
a
dozen
men
,
scaled
the
walls
and
killed
the
sentinel
who
opposed
him
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
succeeded
in
his
purpose
,
had
not
Rosworm
appeared
at
the
juncture
with
a
party
of
musketeers
,
and
forced
him
to
retire
.
<EOS>
All
Standish
gained
by
the
exploit
was
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Having
captured
a
young
soldier
on
the
walls
,
he
carried
him
off
in
his
retreat
.
<EOS>
Little
did
he
suspect
at
the
time
that
the
prisoner
he
had
made
was
no
other
than
Gertrude
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
XVIThe
Burning
of
Alport
LodgeON
that
night
,
Lord
Derby
,
whose
head
-
quarters
were
at
Alport
Lodge
,
retired
early
to
rest
,
being
greatly
fatigued
.
<EOS>
Since
the
hall
was
well
guarded
he
did
not
for
a
moment
imagine
it
would
be
attacked
,
or
if
any
such
rash
attempt
should
be
made
,
he
never
dreamed
it
would
prove
successful
.
<EOS>
Conceiving
himself
,
therefore
,
in
perfect
security
,
he
slept
soundly
,
but
was
roused
from
his
slumbers
by
shouts
and
the
loud
beating
of
a
drum
,
followed
by
the
discharge
of
musketry
.
<EOS>
These
alarming
sounds
announced
that
the
foe
was
upon
them
,
and
springing
from
his
couch
,
he
proceeded
hastily
to
attire
himself
,
and
had
nearly
completed
his
toilette
,
when
Frank
Standish
rushed
into
the
room
,
with
dismay
depicted
on
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
look
scared
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
What
has
happened
?
<EOS>
Speak!""A
sortie
has
been
made
from
the
town
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Standish
.
"But
<EOS>
no
harm
has
been
done
?
"
interrupted
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"Much
mischief
,
I
grieve
to
say
,
has
been
done
,
my
lord
,
"
rejoined
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
been
taken
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
contrived
to
pass
the
sentinels
unperceived
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
they
have
been
driven
off
?
"
cried
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"They
<EOS>
have
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
But
they
have
succeeded
in
their
aim
.
<EOS>
They
have
set
fire
to
the
hall
.
<EOS>
""Set
<EOS>
fire
to
the
hall
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
earl
,
rushing
to
the
window
,
and
looking
forth
.
"
<EOS>
Gracious
heaven
,
it
is
so!""Every
effort
,
I
fear
,
to
extinguish
the
fire
will
be
unavailing
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
hope
not
,
"
cried
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
'
Twill
be
grievous
,
indeed
,
if
this
fine
old
mansion
should
be
destroyed
.
<EOS>
That
calamity
must
be
prevented
if
possible
.
<EOS>
I
will
see
to
the
work
myself
.
<EOS>
Do
not
tarry
here
.
<EOS>
Pursue
the
foe
,
and
bring
back
all
the
prisoners
you
can
.
<EOS>
"Standish
<EOS>
required
no
further
orders
,
but
hurrying
off
,
mounted
his
horse
,
and
accompanied
by
a
party
of
troopers
,
rode
swiftly
towards
the
town
—
with
what
result
has
already
been
shown
.
<EOS>
On
descending
to
the
lower
part
of
the
house
,
Lord
Derby
found
the
whole
place
in
confusion
.
<EOS>
Already
the
fire
had
made
considerable
progress
,
and
the
entrance
-
hall
and
passages
were
filled
with
smoke
.
<EOS>
Serving
-
men
and
soldiers
were
hurrying
hither
and
thither
;
removing
various
articles
under
the
direction
of
Sir
Edward
Mosley
,
who
maintained
the
greatest
composure
at
this
trying
juncture
.
<EOS>
When
Lord
Derby
expressed
his
belief
that
the
hall
might
yet
be
preserved
,
Sir
Edward
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
<EOS>
no
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
place
is
doomed
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
earl
then
went
forth
into
the
courtyard
,
where
he
found
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
,
Sir
Gilbert
Gerard
,
Sir
Alexander
Radcliffe
,
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
,
Mr.
Prestwich
,
and
others
,
who
were
encouraging
the
soldiers
in
their
efforts
to
extinguish
the
fire
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
evidently
impossible
to
arrest
the
progress
of
destruction
.
<EOS>
The
fire
burnt
swiftly
,
the
building
being
old
and
dry
,
and
constructed
,
as
we
have
already
explained
,
of
wood
and
plaster
.
<EOS>
The
incendiaries
had
done
their
work
well
.
<EOS>
They
had
set
fire
to
some
outbuildings
,
which
quickly
communicated
with
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
One
side
of
the
quadrangle
was
entirely
on
fire
,
and
the
flames
were
extending
rapidly
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
,
no
water
could
be
procured
.
<EOS>
By
command
of
the
Earl
of
Derby
<EOS>
an
attempt
was
made
to
pull
down
a
portion
of
the
building
,
but
the
flames
advanced
with
such
rapidity
that
it
could
not
be
accomplished
.
<EOS>
They
had
now
reached
the
roof
,
and
bursting
forth
,
soared
aloft
,
lighting
up
a
portion
of
the
park
,
and
even
illuminating
the
walls
of
the
town
,
and
the
lofty
tower
of
the
Collegiate
Church
.
<EOS>
Viewed
from
the
south
walls
,
the
spectacle
of
the
burning
mansion
was
exceedingly
fine
,
and
was
contemplated
by
several
hundreds
of
the
inhabitants
who
looked
upon
it
as
an
interposition
of
Heaven
in
their
behalf
.
<EOS>
Even
the
Royalists
themselves
felt
dismayed
.
<EOS>
A
new
source
of
alarm
now
arose
.
<EOS>
Sir
Edward
Mosley
suddenly
recollected
that
a
couple
of
barrels
of
powder
were
stowed
away
in
a
cellar
beneath
the
house
,
and
he
gave
orders
that
they
should
be
immediately
removed
.
<EOS>
Several
soldiers
were
willing
to
make
the
hazardous
attempt
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
now
too
late
.
<EOS>
The
fire
had
got
so
near
the
entrance
that
no
one
could
descend
into
the
cellar
with
safety
.
<EOS>
The
only
hope
was
that
the
barrels
might
escape
the
sparks
.
<EOS>
However
,
since
the
risk
was
imminent
,
all
the
persons
assembled
in
the
court-
yard
,
or
on
the
terrace
in
front
of
the
house
,
including
the
servants
,
men
and
women
,
were
ordered
to
withdraw
at
once
to
a
certain
distance
from
the
burning
mansion
.
<EOS>
The
order
was
promptly
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Everybody
hurried
off
,
and
they
had
only
just
reached
a
place
of
safety
when
a
tremendous
explosion
took
place
,
completely
destroying
the
house
,
scattering
the
burning
fragments
in
every
direction
,
and
seeming
to
shake
the
very
ground
.
<EOS>
A
grand
,
but
terrible
sight
<EOS>
,
it
powerfully
affected
all
the
beholders
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
,
who
with
Sir
Edward
Mosley
,
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
,
and
the
others
,
was
standing
at
a
distance
,
expressed
his
great
concern
.
<EOS>
"You
will
now
have
to
seek
a
lodging
elsewhere
,
my
lord
,
"
observed
Sir
Edward
Mosley
.
<EOS>
"Come
with
me
to
Ordsall
,
"
said
Sir
Alexander
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
,
I
shall
not
leave
the
spot
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
,
in
a
sombre
voice
.
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
it
is
dark
I
will
attack
the
town
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
remarked
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
.
<EOS>
The
destruction
of
Alport
Lodge
was
witnessed
with
exultation
from
the
walls
,
where
,
as
we
have
said
,
a
great
number
of
the
townspeople
were
now
gathered
.
<EOS>
Their
rejoicing
found
expression
in
a
hymn
,
in
which
so
many
voices
joined
,
that
it
reached
the
ears
of
the
Royalists
.
<EOS>
Amongst
those
on
the
walls
was
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
greatly
troubled
.
<EOS>
His
beloved
daughter
had
disappeared
,
and
no
doubt
had
been
carried
off
as
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XVIIWhither
Gertrude
was
takenNEXT
morning
,
as
soon
as
it
became
light
,
the
blackened
ruins
of
the
fine
old
hall
presented
a
dismal
spectacle
,
and
inspired
all
the
Royalists
who
gazed
upon
them
with
a
fierce
desire
of
vengeance
.
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
,
the
ordnance
at
the
battery
began
to
play
upon
the
town
,
and
the
firing
was
continued
without
intermission
for
nearly
three
hours
,
but
without
doing
any
material
damage
.
<EOS>
An
attack
was
likewise
made
by
the
Earl
of
Derby
in
person
on
the
battery
at
the
end
of
Deans
-
gate
,
but
the
defence
of
Captain
Bradshaw
and
his
men
was
so
determined
that
an
entrance
could
not
be
gained
,
and
the
earl
,
to
his
great
mortification
,
was
compelled
to
retire
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
attacked
the
barrier
in
Market
-
street
Lane
,
but
with
equal
ill
success
,
and
the
constant
attempts
by
the
Royalist
soldiers
to
scale
the
walls
at
various
points
,
resulted
in
failure
.
<EOS>
The
same
ill
fortune
attended
Lord
Molineux
and
Sir
John
Girlington
in
Salford
.
<EOS>
The
bridge
was
so
stoutly
defended
by
Rosworm
that
they
could
not
cross
it
,
and
sustained
heavy
loss
in
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
Finding
that
no
impression
could
be
made
upon
the
town
,
and
apprehensive
that
another
sortie
might
be
made
at
night
by
Captain
Bradshaw
,
Lord
Derby
caused
a
deep
trench
to
be
digged
at
the
end
of
Deansgate
,
and
though
the
engineers
were
protected
by
a
large
party
of
musketeers
,
three
or
four
were
shot
before
the
work
could
be
completed
.
<EOS>
During
the
greater
part
of
the
morning
,
Frank
Standish
had
been
so
much
occupied
that
he
had
no
time
to
attend
to
the
prisoners
,
but
committed
their
charge
to
a
sergeant
,
by
whom
they
were
placed
in
a
farm
-
house
,
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
,
a
guard
being
stationed
near
the
building
to
prevent
their
escape
.
<EOS>
Later
in
the
day
,
Standish
rode
to
this
farmhouse
,
and
dismounting
at
the
door
entered
the
building
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
looking
about
,
the
farmer
's
wife
,
a
middle
-
aged
woman
,
came
to
him
,
and
said:"We
have
made
a
strange
discovery
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
prisoners
who
was
brought
from
the
town
last
night
proves
to
be
a
young
damsel
.
<EOS>
"Standish
<EOS>
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
.
<EOS>
"What
is
more
,
pursued
the
woman
,
she
is
the
daughter
of
Colonel
Rosworm
,
the
German
engineer
,
who
has
fortified
the
town
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
Joan
recognised
her
at
once
.
<EOS>
""This
is
strange
,
indeed
!
"
cried
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
she?""In
an
inner
room
,
"
replied
the
woman
.
<EOS>
"
Joan
is
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
persuaded
her
to
lay
aside
her
soldier
's
dress
she
had
put
on
,
and
has
lent
her
a
gown
that
fits
her
exactly
.
<EOS>
""Take
me
to
her
at
once
<EOS>
,
I
pray
you
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
The
good
woman
complied
,
and
ushered
him
into
a
small
room
,
where
he
found
Gertrude
and
the
rustic
maiden
,
who
was
really
very
pretty
.
<EOS>
"Little
<EOS>
did
I
dream
what
a
prize
I
had
made
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
not
have
to
endure
a
long
captivity
.
<EOS>
Before
night
you
shall
be
exchanged
.
<EOS>
""I
have
nothing
to
complain
of
,
"
said
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
Mistress
Bancroft
and
her
daughter
Joan
have
been
exceedingly
kind
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
,
I
fear
,
my
father
will
be
uneasy
about
me
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
juncture
,
a
noise
was
heard
outside
the
cottage
,
and
it
presently
appeared
that
it
was
caused
by
the
arrival
of
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
who
came
to
look
after
the
prisoners
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
was
greatly
surprised
to
learn
that
Rosworm
's
daughter
was
a
captive
.
<EOS>
"I
have
just
caused
a
parley
to
be
sounded
,
"
he
said
,
and
am
about
to
send
a
messenger
to
the
governor
.
<EOS>
You
shall
go
with
him
.
<EOS>
Tell
your
father
that
,
but
for
him
,
I
should
long
since
have
taken
the
town
.
<EOS>
Had
he
served
the
King
as
well
as
he
has
served
the
Parliament
,
the
rebellion
would
soon
have
been
crushed
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
fail
to
tell
him
what
your
lordship
says
,
"
replied
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"Methinks
,
my
lord
<EOS>
,
"
said
Standish
,
"
since
we
have
obtained
this
prize
,
we
ought
not
to
part
with
her
.
<EOS>
Let
her
remain
with
these
good
folks
.
<EOS>
Her
father
ought
to
pay
a
heavy
ransom
.
<EOS>
If
he
wants
her
,
let
him
come
for
her
.
<EOS>
""I
am
quite
willing
to
take
charge
of
her
,
"
said
Mistress
Bancroft
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
I
will
attend
upon
her
,
"
added
Joan
.
<EOS>
"Be
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
so
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
content
to
remain
a
prisoner
for
a
short
time
longer
,
fair
damsel
,
"
he
added
.
<EOS>
"
But
be
not
alarmed
.
<EOS>
You
are
in
no
danger
here
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
fear
,
my
lord
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
pray
that
my
father
may
be
informed
that
I
am
in
safety
.
<EOS>
""It
shall
be
done
,
"
said
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
Captain
Standish
will
deliver
your
message
to
him
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
followed
by
Standish
,
he
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
A
troop
of
horse
was
drawn
up
in
the
farmyard
.
<EOS>
Giving
a
paper
to
Standish
,
he
bade
him
ride
to
the
town
,
and
present
it
to
the
governor
.
<EOS>
"A
parley
has
been
sounded
,
"
said
the
earl
,
"
so
that
admittance
to
the
town
will
be
granted
you
.
<EOS>
The
missive
is
a
summons
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
Bring
back
an
answer
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
willing
to
grant
a
delay
of
twelve
hours
,
should
it
be
required
,
during
which
truce
all
acts
of
hostility
must
cease
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
"CHAPTER
<EOS>
XVIIIThe
Earl
of
Derby
has
an
Interview
with
RoswormSTANDISH
then
rode
towards
the
town
attended
by
a
trumpeter
,
who
blew
a
loud
blast
as
they
approached
the
Deansgate
barrier
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Captain
Bradshaw
learnt
his
errand
,
he
allowed
his
advance
,
and
sent
on
a
couple
of
troopers
with
him
to
the
market
-
place
,
where
he
found
Colonel
Holland
on
horseback
,
with
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"I
bring
your
excellency
another
message
from
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
lordship
summons
you
once
more
in
the
king
's
name
to
surrender
the
town
—
to
lay
down
your
arms
,
and
deliver
them
up
to
him
.
<EOS>
""Aught
more
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Colonel
Holland
,
exchanging
a
look
with
Rosworm
,
who
smiled
sternly
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
demands
that
a
thousand
pounds
be
delivered
to
him
;
and
he
further
requires
three
hundred
muskets
,
in
addition
to
those
which
you
will
give
up
.
<EOS>
""We
are
more
likely
to
demand
muskets
than
to
yield
up
ours
,
"
observed
the
governor
,
dryly
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
his
lordship
's
demands
are
agreed
to
he
will
raise
the
siege
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"We
shall
force
him
to
raise
the
siege
,
"
remarked
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
you
refuse
the
terms
offered
you
?
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"Peremptorily
,
"
said
the
governor
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
no
fear
of
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
We
can
certainly
hold
out
against
him
till
we
are
reinforced
by
the
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
we
agree
to
the
proposed
truce
,
and
will
suspend
hostilities
for
twelve
hours
.
<EOS>
You
shall
then
have
our
final
answer
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
interview
being
ended
,
Standish
was
about
to
ride
off
,
but
Rosworm
stopped
him
.
<EOS>
"A
word
with
you
,
sir
,
ere
you
depart
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
My
daughter
is
a
prisoner
—
will
she
be
delivered
up?""I
have
no
authority
to
make
any
promise
respecting
her
,
"
replied
Standish
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
doubt
not
she
will
be
restored
to
you
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
you
may
rest
assured
she
will
be
well
cared
for
.
<EOS>
""Lord
<EOS>
Derby
will
do
an
act
worthy
of
his
name
,
by
restoring
her
at
once
,
"
observed
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"I
will
tell
his
lordship
what
you
say
;
but
I
can
make
no
promise
,
"
rejoined
Standish
.
<EOS>
And
saluting
the
governor
,
he
rode
off
.
<EOS>
It
being
announced
that
a
short
suspension
of
arms
had
been
agreed
upon
by
both
sides
,
firing
entirely
ceased
,
and
perfect
tranquillity
reigned
within
the
town
.
<EOS>
But
the
greatest
vigilance
was
exercised
by
the
besiegers
in
order
to
prevent
any
provisions
from
being
brought
into
the
town
,
and
all
the
entrances
were
strictly
watched
.
<EOS>
No
supplies
could
,
therefore
,
be
obtained
by
the
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
But
they
did
not
feel
uneasy
;
for
although
their
ammunition
was
well
-
nigh
exhausted
,
and
their
provisions
were
running
low
,
they
believed
Heaven
would
aid
them
.
<EOS>
As
usual
,
a
nocturnal
service
was
held
in
the
Collegiate
Church
,
and
it
was
attended
by
an
immense
number
of
persons
.
<EOS>
Amongst
the
congregation
was
Rosworm
,
and
as
he
was
quitting
the
building
,
his
eye
fell
upon
a
figure
in
the
throng
.
<EOS>
The
individual
in
question
was
a
stranger
to
him
,
but
the
countenance
was
so
remarkable
,
that
he
could
not
fail
to
be
struck
by
it
.
<EOS>
The
attire
of
the
person
,
and
his
long
dark
locks
,
showed
he
was
not
a
Roundhead
.
<EOS>
Yet
who
could
he
be
?
<EOS>
A
strange
suspicion
crossed
him
that
it
was
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
but
he
dismissed
the
notion
as
soon
as
formed
,
and
proceeded
to
his
own
dwelling
,
which
we
have
already
mentioned
adjoined
the
church
.
<EOS>
He
had
reached
the
door
,
and
was
about
to
enter
,
when
the
mysterious
individual
,
who
must
have
followed
him
at
a
distance
,
came
up
.
<EOS>
"Can
<EOS>
I
have
a
few
words
with
you
,
Colonel
Rosworm
?
"
said
the
person
.
<EOS>
Rosworm
answered
in
the
affirmative
,
and
as
soon
as
the
stranger
had
entered
,
he
barred
the
door
.
<EOS>
A
lamp
was
burning
on
the
table
,
and
taking
it
up
,
he
threw
its
light
on
a
stately
figure
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
doubt
that
the
Earl
of
Derby
stood
before
him
.
"My
<EOS>
lord
,
"
he
said
,
"
you
have
done
rashly
in
entering
the
town
in
this
fashion
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
fear
that
you
will
betray
me
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
—
for
it
was
he
.
"Hum
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
Your
lordship
has
voluntarily
placed
yourself
in
my
hands
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
be
doing
my
duty
<EOS>
were
I
to
allow
you
to
depart
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
will
not
hinder
me
,
"
said
the
earl
.
"Wherefore
<EOS>
not
,
my
lord
?
"
rejoined
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"Because
<EOS>
a
promise
has
been
given
me
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
whom
?
"
demanded
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
me
,
"
responded
Gertrude
,
rushing
from
the
inner
room
,
and
throwing
herself
into
his
arms
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
emotion
kept
Rosworm
silent
.
<EOS>
He
then
asked:"Didst
thou
bring
Lord
Derby
here?""I
did
,
father
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
enabled
him
to
enter
the
town
,
and
brought
him
to
this
house
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
I
promised
him
in
your
name
that
he
should
return
in
safety
.
<EOS>
"Rosworm
made
no
remark
,
and
she
went
on
.
<EOS>
"I
could
not
do
otherwise
,
since
his
lordship
desired
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
set
me
free
.
<EOS>
""I
wished
to
have
some
talk
with
you
,
"
said
the
earl
,
"
and
took
this
means
of
obtaining
my
wish
.
<EOS>
""My
lord
,
"
said
Rosworm
,
gravely
,
"
if
you
design
to
make
any
proposition
to
me
,
understand
that
I
can
not
listen
to
it
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
wish
to
shake
your
fidelity
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
But
this
siege
can
not
last
long
.
<EOS>
When
it
is
over
,
will
you
enter
into
my
service
?
<EOS>
You
know
Lathom
House?""I
have
heard
of
it
,
my
lord
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
a
strong
place
.
<EOS>
""I
mean
to
garrison
it
for
the
king
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Will
you
aid
the
Countess
of
Derby
to
defend
it
?
<EOS>
I
will
make
it
worth
your
while
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"For
<EOS>
a
few
minutes
Rosworm
made
no
reply
,
and
seemed
debating
the
matter
within
himself
.
<EOS>
"Accept
<EOS>
the
offer
<EOS>
,
I
entreat
you
,
father
!
"
said
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"I
do
not
wish
you
to
desert
your
present
post
,
"
said
the
Earl
of
Derby
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
understand
aright
,
you
have
not
a
permanent
engagement
with
the
Governor
of
Manchester
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
lordship
has
been
correctly
informed
,
"
rejoined
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"When
<EOS>
this
siege
is
ended
,
you
will
be
free
?
<EOS>
"
pursued
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
shall
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"Then
you
can
join
with
me
?
"
said
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Manchester
men
might
calumniate
me
,
and
say
that
I
had
been
bought
,
"
rejoined
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"Heed
them
not
!
"
cried
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
have
fully
discharged
your
engagement
to
them
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
till
then
do
I
ask
you
to
join
me
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
recognise
the
honourable
principles
by
which
you
are
actuated
.
<EOS>
""My
lord
,
"
said
Rosworm
,
"
I
am
a
mercenary
soldier
,
but
I
am
,
also
,
a
man
of
honour
.
<EOS>
If
the
Manchester
men
desire
to
retain
me
,
I
shall
continue
with
them
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
I
will
come
to
your
lordship
.
<EOS>
I
can
make
no
other
promise
.
<EOS>
""I
must
own
that
I
am
grievously
disappointed
,
"
observed
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
persuaded
myself
you
would
be
proud
to
serve
the
Countess
of
Derby
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
countess
,
I
know
,
is
one
of
the
noblest
ladies
in
the
land
,
"
rejoined
Rosworm
;
"
and
her
courage
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
not
,
is
equal
to
her
high
rank
—
but
I
must
abide
by
my
engagement
.
<EOS>
""Enough
!
"
cried
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
deem
your
scruples
idle
—
but
will
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
on
your
account
,
fair
damsel
,
"
he
added
to
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"
The
countess
would
have
been
glad
to
have
you
with
her
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
delighted
to
serve
her
ladyship
,
"
cried
Gertrude
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
shall
do
so
,
if
your
father
will
part
with
you
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"May
<EOS>
I
accept
the
offer
,
father
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Gertrude
,
imploringly
.
<EOS>
"E'en
as
thou
wilt
,
"
rejoined
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
hinder
thee
.
<EOS>
""Then
come
to
Lathom
when
this
siege
is
ended
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
Perchance
,
your
father
may
bring
you
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
hope
<EOS>
so
,
my
lord
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"I
make
no
promise

"
said
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
repeat
thou
art
free
to
do
as
thou
wilt

<EOS>
""Are
<EOS>
you
in
earnest
,
father

<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
<EOS>
"Quite
<EOS>
in
earnest

"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
my
full
consent
to
the
step
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
we
shall
expect
you
at
Lathom
ere
long

"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"I
will
come
,
my
lord

joyfully

"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
business
here
is
done

the

Colonl

you

out

replied
the
other

Tis
lucky

But
you

best
pull
your

over
your

and
hide
your

you
may
be
discovered

I
am
ready

added

unbarring
the
door

the

CHAPTER
XIXHow
Rosworm
got
the
Earl
out
of
the
TownIT
wanted
but
an
hour
of
midnight
as
Rosworm
and
the
earl
sallied
forth
,
and
the
street
was
almost
deserted
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
Crossing
the
churchyard
,
they
proceeded
along
Cateaton
-
street
,
and
had
reached
Smithy
Door
,
when
they
encountered
a
patrol
.
<EOS>
It
consisted
of
a
dozen
men
belonging
to
the
town
-
guard
,
and
was
headed
by
Captain
Cranage
,
who
commanded
them
to
halt
in
a
loud
authoritative
tone
.
<EOS>
Rosworm
immediately
gave
the
counter
-
sign
,
but
Cranage
did
not
appear
entirely
satisfied
,
and
turning
to
Lord
Derby
demanded
his
name
.
<EOS>
The
earl
made
no
reply
,
whereupon
Rosworm
interposed
,
and
said:"'T
is
sufficient
he
is
with
me
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
not
like
his
appearance
,
"
said
Cranage
.
<EOS>
"
He
must
give
an
account
of
himself
to
the
governor
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
,
"
he
added
to
the
earl
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
,
however
,
did
not
move
,
and
the
order
being
repeated
,
he
put
his
hand
to
his
sword
.
<EOS>
The
action
did
not
pass
unnoticed
by
Cranage
,
who
ordered
two
of
his
men
to
seize
him
and
bring
him
along
.
"Off
!
"
cried
the
earl
,
fiercely
,
as
they
advanced
to
execute
the
order
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
touch
me
at
your
peril
.
"Rosworm
<EOS>
now
deemed
it
necessary
to
interpose
.
<EOS>
"Meddle
<EOS>
not
with
him
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
answer
for
him
.
<EOS>
""He
has
the
appearance
of
a
malignant
,
"
said
Cranage
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
is
a
Parliamentarian
he
will
not
object
to
come
before
the
governor
.
<EOS>
""It
is
needless
,
I
tell
you
,
"
cried
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
said
I
will
answer
for
him
.
<EOS>
Would
you
set
up
your
authority
against
mine
?
<EOS>
Stand
aside
,
and
let
us
pass
.
<EOS>
"Cranage
<EOS>
did
not
venture
to
offer
any
further
resistance
,
for
he
feared
he
might
be
reprimanded
by
the
governor
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
allowed
Rosworm
and
his
companion
to
proceed
;
but
when
they
had
got
to
a
certain
distance
,
he
quitted
his
men
and
followed
them
.
<EOS>
He
saw
them
proceed
to
Saint
Mary
's
Gate
,
and
fancied
they
halted
near
the
conduit
,
but
on
arriving
at
this
spot
he
could
see
nothing
of
them
.
<EOS>
No
one
was
near
who
could
give
him
any
information
.
<EOS>
He
hurried
to
the
end
of
Market
-
street
Lane
,
and
then
to
Deansgate
,
but
seeing
nothing
of
them
in
either
thoroughfare
,
he
mounted
the
walls
,
and
addressing
a
sentinel
,
asked
whether
he
had
seen
Colonel
Rosworm?"He
was
here
not
five
minutes
ago
,
"
replied
the
man
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
making
his
rounds
,
and
came
from
Deansgate
.
<EOS>
""Was
<EOS>
he
alone
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Cranage
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"I
can
not
tell
,
"
rejoined
the
sentinel
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
saw
some
one
with
him
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
But
if
it
were
so
,
the
person
must
have
left
him
suddenly
.
<EOS>
""He
has
escaped
,
"
muttered
Cranage
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
to
be
the
Earl
of
Derby
himself!"CHAPTER
<EOS>
XXHow
<EOS>
the
Siege
was
Raised
by
Command
of
the
KingNEXT
day
,
a
council
of
war
was
held
by
Lord
Derby
and
the
chief
Royalist
gentlemen
at
Hulme
Hall
,
the
seat
of
Mr.
Thomas
Prestwich
.
<EOS>
At
this
meeting
,
Lord
Molineux
and
Sir
John
Girlington
assisted
,
and
it
was
unanimously
resolved
that
,
if
the
terms
offered
should
be
refused
by
Colonel
Holland
and
the
Parliament
officers
,
the
siege
should
be
vigorously
carried
on
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
thought
it
would
be
better
to
burn
down
the
town
without
delay
than
allow
the
garrison
to
wait
for
the
reinforcements
,
and
in
this
proposition
the
majority
of
the
council
entirely
concurred
.
<EOS>
Every
preparation
,
therefore
,
was
made
for
the
renewal
of
hostilities
at
the
expiration
of
the
armistice
,
in
case
the
conditions
offered
by
Lord
Derby
should
be
rejected
.
<EOS>
A
council
was
likewise
held
by
the
Parliamentarians
,
in
which
the
only
voice
in
favour
of
peace
was
Colonel
Holland
's
,
but
he
was
overruled
,
the
militia
and
townsfolk
declaring
they
would
rather
shed
their
last
drop
of
blood
than
deliver
up
the
town
.
<EOS>
An
early
morning
service
took
place
in
the
Collegiate
Church
,
and
a
sermon
was
preached
by
Warden
Heyrick
.
<EOS>
Discourses
were
likewise
delivered
in
various
parts
of
the
town
by
the
different
ministers
,
and
hymns
sung
.
<EOS>
In
this
manner
the
ardour
of
the
townspeople
was
greatly
inflamed
,
and
no
one
would
hear
of
a
surrender
.
<EOS>
When
the
hour
arrived
for
the
delivery
of
the
answer
,
Colonel
Holland
rode
forth
from
Deansgate
attended
by
Captains
Radcliffe
,
Bradshaw
,
and
Booth
,
and
followed
by
a
company
of
well
-
mounted
and
well
-
armed
horsemen
.
<EOS>
They
were
watched
by
a
great
number
of
the
townsfolk
,
men
and
women
,
who
were
collected
on
the
walls
facing
Alport
Park
,
and
by
Rosworm
and
his
daughter
from
the
summit
of
the
church
-
tower
.
<EOS>
About
a
bow
-
shot
from
the
gate
was
stationed
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
completely
armed
,
and
mounted
on
a
noble
charger
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
was
closely
attended
by
Frank
Standish
,
and
at
a
little
distance
were
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
,
Sir
Alexander
Radcliffe
,
Sir
Edward
Mosley
,
and
Mr.
Prestwich
.
<EOS>
Behind
was
drawn
up
the
whole
of
the
Royalist
cavalry
and
dragoons
—
each
troop
having
a
captain
—
and
yet
further
on
were
the
foot
soldiers
,
altogether
forming
a
splendid
sight
.
<EOS>
At
the
battery
behind
the
trench
recently
digged
in
front
of
Deansgate
,
cannon
was
planted
,
and
the
artillerymen
were
in
readiness
.
<EOS>
Everything
betokened
that
a
grand
attack
could
at
once
be
made
upon
the
town
,
if
necessary
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
though
little
display
was
made
,
no
preparations
for
the
defence
had
been
neglected
by
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
On
Colonel
Holland
's
approach
Lord
Derby
rode
forward
to
meet
him
,
and
courteous
salutations
passed
between
them
.
<EOS>
After
they
had
exchanged
a
few
words
,
the
earl
said:"I
hope
my
offer
can
be
accepted
,
colonel
,
and
that
we
shall
be
able
to
come
to
an
amicable
understanding
.
<EOS>
""I
fear
not
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
governor
,
assuming
a
grave
expression
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
as
anxious
as
your
lordship
can
be
that
the
effusion
of
blood
should
be
stayed
,
and
that
the
horrors
of
a
civil
war
should
be
avoided
,
but
this
can
only
be
accomplished
in
one
way
,
and
it
does
not
rest
with
us
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
Heaven
has
fought
on
our
side
,
so
that
we
have
been
able
to
resist
every
attack
made
upon
us
.
<EOS>
It
is
idle
,
therefore
,
to
suppose
we
shall
surrender
the
town
while
we
are
able
to
keep
it
.
<EOS>
The
siege
must
be
raised
by
your
lordship
,
if
peace
is
to
be
made
between
us
.
<EOS>
""Never
<EOS>
will
I
raise
the
siege
,
colonel
,
"
rejoined
Lord
Derby
firmly
,
"
unless
by
his
majesty
's
express
command
.
<EOS>
The
bloody
strife
must
,
therefore
,
continue
.
<EOS>
But
be
not
too
confident
that
you
can
maintain
the
town
.
<EOS>
That
I
have
underrated
your
strength
I
freely
admit
—
but
in
concluding
you
can
hold
out
you
are
equally
mistaken
.
<EOS>
""We
can
hold
out
till
we
are
relieved
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
governor
.
<EOS>
"
Reinforcements
are
certain
to
be
sent
us
by
the
Parliament
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
they
may
be
cut
off
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
Prince
Rupert
will
take
care
<EOS>
they
do
not
reach
you
.
<EOS>
""We
have
little
apprehension
on
that
score
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
governor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Prince
Rupert
will
be
wanted
by
the
king
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
all
my
attempts
at
pacification
are
vain
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
In
an
hour
I
shall
recommence
the
attack
.
<EOS>
Be
not
surprised
if
we
should
visit
the
town
to-
night
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
that
case
I
must
prepare
for
your
lordship
's
reception
,
"
rejoined
the
governor
.
<EOS>
And
courteously
saluting
the
earl
,
he
rode
back
to
the
town
with
his
companions
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
was
he
gone
when
Sir
Thomas
Tyldes
-
ley
informed
the
earl
that
a
messenger
had
just
arrived
from
the
king
.
"'Tis
<EOS>
Captain
Galliard
,
"
said
Sir
Thomas
;
"
he
has
brought
this
letter
for
your
lordship
.
<EOS>
"Lord
<EOS>
Derby
hastily
opened
the
despatch
,
and
glanced
at
its
contents
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
habitual
self
-
command
,
he
could
not
conceal
his
annoyance
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
lordship
looks
disturbed
,
"
said
Sir
Thomas
;
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
not
received
bad
news?""So
bad
that
I
scarcely
like
to
mention
them
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
majesty
has
commanded
me
to
raise
the
siege
,
and
return
to
Warrington
without
delay
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
you
will
not
obey
the
injunction
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Tyldesley
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
made
no
reply
,
but
desired
to
speak
with
the
messenger
,
whereupon
Captain
Galliard
came
forward
.
<EOS>
"Are
<EOS>
you
acquainted
with
the
contents
of
this
despatch
,
sir
?
"
asked
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"No
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Galliard
.
<EOS>
"
I
received
it
from
his
majesty
's
own
hands
,
and
he
bade
me
tell
your
lordship
that
it
must
be
instantly
obeyed
.
<EOS>
I
have
ridden
as
hard
as
I
could
from
Nottingham
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
would
you
had
arrived
an
hour
later
,
for
the
attack
would
then
have
commenced
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Never
before
did
I
feel
inclined
to
disobey
his
majesty
's
order
.
<EOS>
What
shall
I
do
,
Tyldesley?""I
<EOS>
dare
not
counsel
you
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
know
what
I
would
do
myself
.
<EOS>
""No
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
I
must
not
be
disloyal
,
"
cried
the
earl
.
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
Sir
Alexander
Radcliffe
and
the
others
,
he
said:"Gentlemen
,
the
attack
will
not
be
made
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
received
the
king
's
orders
to
raise
the
siege
forthwith
.
<EOS>
"They
looked
at
each
other
in
surprise
and
consternation
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
lord
,
"
said
Sir
Alexander
Radcliffe
,
"
the
men
will
be
greatly
dissatisfied
when
they
hear
the
order
.
<EOS>
They
feel
certain
we
should
take
the
town
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
""It
can
not
be
helped
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
.
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
Standish
,
he
bade
him
cross
the
river
at
Ordsall
,
and
proceed
as
quickly
as
he
could
to
Salford
to
communicate
the
intelligence
to
Lord
Molineux
and
Sir
John
Girlington
.
<EOS>
"Take
<EOS>
Captain
Galliard
with
you
,
"
he
added
.
<EOS>
Standish
immediately
rode
off
on
his
errand
,
accompanied
by
the
messenger
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
exceed
the
dissatisfaction
of
the
soldiers
when
the
order
was
made
known
to
them
.
<EOS>
The
arrival
of
Captain
Galliard
and
his
interview
with
the
earl
had
been
witnessed
by
Rosworm
from
the
summit
of
the
church
-
tower
,
and
he
at
once
inferred
from
the
subsequent
proceedings
that
the
siege
would
be
raised
,
and
communicated
his
opinion
to
the
governor
.
<EOS>
The
opinion
seemed
confirmed
,
when
no
attack
was
made
.
<EOS>
All
remained
quiet
throughout
the
day
,
and
nothing
was
heard
during
the
night
,
but
when
Rosworm
looked
from
the
church
-
tower
next
morn
,
the
bridge
was
clear
—
the
besiegers
were
gone
from
Salford

CHARLOTTE
DE

TRÉMOILLE
,
COUNTESS
OF
DERBYCHAPTER
ILathom
HouseABOUT
<EOS>
a
week
after
the
siege
of
Manchester
had
been
raised
in
the
manner
previously
related
,
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
accompanied
by
Lord
Molineux
and
Sir
John
Girlington
,
and
attended
by
a
large
body
of
men
,
set
out
from
Wigan
—
one
of
the
few
towns
in
Lancashire
that
remained
perfectly
faithful
to
the
king
,
and
took
his
way
towards
Lathom
House
.
<EOS>
As
he
came
in
sight
of
the
stronghold
,
he
remarked
with
a
stern
smile
to
those
near
him:"That
house
will
never
be
taken
by
the
rebels
.
"Lathom
<EOS>
House
was
certainly
a
magnificent
pile
,
and
so
large
that
,
according
to
an
old
poem
,
"
within
it
could
be
lodged
kyngys
three
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
also
at
Lathom
House
that
a
former
Earl
of
Derby
had
dwelt
in
such
state
,
that
it
was
said
by
Camden
,
"
that
with
his
death
the
glory
of
English
hospitality
had
fallen
asleep
.
"
<EOS>
Equal
hospitality
had
likewise
been
exercised
in
the
same
lordly
mansion
by
James
Earl
of
Derby
until
the
breaking
out
of
the
Civil
War
,
when
he
had
been
obliged
to
fortify
the
house
,
and
arm
the
greater
part
of
his
servants
and
retainers
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
striking
and
picturesque
than
the
appearance
of
Lathom
House
,
at
the
period
of
our
story
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
vast
embattled
mansion
,
crowned
with
turrets
,
from
the
midst
of
which
rose
a
lofty
square
tower
,
called
the
Eagle
Tower
.
<EOS>
From
the
summit
of
this
tower
was
displayed
the
proud
banner
of
the
Stanleys
,
bearing
the
loyal
motto
—
SANS
CHANGER.Originally
built
in
the
reign
of
Henry
the
Seventh
,
Lathom
House
is
said
to
have
furnished
that
monarch
with
the
design
of
Richmond
Palace
.
<EOS>
Possessing
a
very
grand
and
imposing
exterior
,
it
contained
many
noble
apartments
—
an
immense
banqueting
-
hall
,
and
a
grand
presence
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
Attached
to
it
was
a
beautiful
chapel
.
<EOS>
The
outer
court
,
which
was
of
considerable
extent
,
and
contained
large
stables
and
other
buildings
intended
for
the
garrison
,
was
surrounded
by
strong
battlemented
walls
,
defended
by
nine
towers
,
each
provided
with
six
large
pieces
of
cannon
—
three
placed
to
fire
one
way
,
and
three
the
other
.
<EOS>
The
walls
were
encompassed
by
an
unusually
wide
and
deep
moat
,
the
inner
banks
of
which
were
defended
by
a
row
of
stout
palisades
.
<EOS>
The
walls
were
strengthened
internally
by
earthworks
,
two
feet
in
thickness
.
<EOS>
The
gatehouse
was
exceedingly
lofty
and
strong
,
and
its
machicolated
battlements
and
tall
towers
were
furnished
with
ordnance
;
while
the
entrance
was
protected
by
a
drawbridge
and
double
portcullis
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
is
something
particular
and
romantic
in
the
situation
of
this
house
,
"
says
Archdeacon
Rutter
,
"
as
if
nature
herself
had
formed
it
for
a
stronghold
,
or
place
of
security
.
<EOS>
The
uncommon
situation
of
it
may
be
compared
to
the
palm
of
a
man
's
hand
,
flat
in
the
middle
,
and
covered
with
a
rising
round
about
it
,
and
so
near
to
it
,
that
the
enemy
in
two
years
were
never
able
to
raise
a
battery
against
it
so
as
to
make
a
breach
in
the
wall
practicable
to
enter
the
house
by
way
of
storm
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
ground
on
which
Lathom
House
stood
was
a
moorish
tract
but
thoroughly
drained
by
the
moat
.
<EOS>
At
a
short
distance
from
the
mansion
there
was
a
park
,
and
embosomed
among
the
trees
was
Burscough
Priory
—
a
convent
of
Black
Canons
,
founded
by
Robert
Fitz
-
Henry
,
Lord
of
Lathom
,
in
the
reign
of
Richard
the
First
.
<EOS>
Wherever
it
could
be
seen
,
this
strong
castellated
mansion
,
with
its
great
gatehouse
,
embattled
walls
,
numerous
turrets
,
and
lofty
central
tower
<EOS>
presented
a
most
imposing
appearance
.
<EOS>
In
the
presence
-
chamber
,
and
in
a
high
-
backed
ebony
chair
,
sat
a
majestic
dame
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
be
called
young
,
yet
she
was
still
exceedingly
handsome
,
and
possessed
a
full
,
stately
figure
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
was
dignified
,
and
at
times
haughty
,
and
her
look
showed
she
was
accustomed
to
command
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
remarkably
fine
,
of
a
dark
hazel
,
fringed
with
long
silken
lashes
,
and
arched
over
by
finely
pencilled
brows
.
<EOS>
Her
dark
tresses
were
brought
in
small
curls
over
her
brow
and
flowed
down
in
ringlets
at
the
side
and
at
the
back
,
according
to
the
then
charming
mode
.
<EOS>
She
wore
a
collar
of
pearls
,
and
large
pearl
ear
-
rings
.
<EOS>
Her
gown
was
of
black
velvet
,
trimmed
with
lace
,
and
her
stomacher
was
adorned
with
pearls
.
<EOS>
In
the
peculiar
grace
of
her
manner
,
as
in
her
speech
,
there
was
something
that
showed
she
was
of
French
origin
.
<EOS>
Need
we
say
this
was
Charlotte
de
la
Trémoille
,
Countess
of
Derby
?
<EOS>
From
her
charms
and
her
ability
,
it
is
not
wonderful
that
she
held
such
sway
over
her
noble
husband
.
<EOS>
With
the
countess
were
her
three
daughters
,
ranging
from
ten
to
thirteen
—
lovely
creatures
,
dressed
in
white
satin
,
and
wearing
their
hair
in
the
same
becoming
fashion
as
their
mother
.
<EOS>
All
three
had
fine
bright
eyes
and
charming
features
.
<EOS>
The
elder
—
the
Lady
Henriette
Marie
Stanley
,
to
whom
the
queen
had
stood
godmother
,
was
tall
,
and
possessed
a
slight
graceful
figure
.
<EOS>
When
of
tender
age
she
had
been
contracted
to
Lord
Molineux
.
<EOS>
Lady
Katherine
,
the
second
daughter
,
was
about
a
year
younger
than
her
sister
,
and
equally
beautiful
.
<EOS>
A
blonde
,
with
light
blue
eyes
,
fair
tresses
,
a
delicate
complexion
,
she
had
a
very
gentle
expression
of
countenance
,
and
a
very
engaging
manner
.
<EOS>
If
we
may
be
permitted
to
glance
into
the
future
,
we
may
mention
that
the
Lady
Katherine
was
subsequently
wedded
to
Henry
Pierrepoint
,
second
Earl
of
Kingston-
upon
-
Hull
,
and
was
buried
at
Hurstpierpoint
,
in
Sussex
.
<EOS>
The
liveliest
,
and
perhaps
the
most
attractive
of
the
three
girls
,
was
the
Lady
Amelia
—
a
bright
little
brunette
,
with
sparkling
black
eyes
,
and
a
brilliant
complexion
.
<EOS>
Again
to
forecast
the
future
,
it
may
be
mentioned
that
this
lovely
creature
—
her
mother
's
favourite
—
became
Marchioness
of
Athole
.
<EOS>
She
was
now
playing
with
her
little
brothers
,
Edward
and
William
.
<EOS>
Edward
,
a
grave
-
looking
boy
then
some
four
years
old
,
was
dressed
in
black
velvet
,
and
his
dark
hair
,
brought
over
his
brow
,
made
him
look
like
a
miniature
of
the
earl
,
his
father
,
to
whom
his
features
bore
a
marked
resemblance
.
<EOS>
William
,
the
youngest
of
the
party
,
being
scarcely
three
,
was
seated
on
a
tabouret
near
the
countess
,
and
comported
himself
well
,
being
a
very
quiet
little
boy
.
<EOS>
The
children
we
have
enumerated
constituted
the
whole
of
Lord
Derby
's
family
,
with
the
exception
of
Charles
,
Lord
Strange
,
born
in
1628
,
who
was
then
in
Holland
.
<EOS>
A
middle
-
aged
nurse
,
of
discreet
appearance
,
and
attired
in
very
sober
apparel
,
was
in
attendance
upon
the
younger
children
.
<EOS>
No
one
else
was
present
at
the
moment
,
though
different
members
of
the
household
from
time
to
time
entered
the
hall
.
<EOS>
The
countess
looked
unusually
cheerful
,
for
she
expected
the
earl
from
Wigan
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
Of
necessity
his
lordship
had
been
long
absent
from
home
,
so
that
his
return
was
eagerly
looked
for
by
his
family
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
think
our
father
will
really
return
today
,
dearest
mother
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Lady
Katherine
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
been
so
often
disappointed
that
I
almost
despair
of
beholding
him
again
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
countess
heaved
a
sigh
,
for
she
,
too
,
had
been
often
disappointed
;
but
her
face
brightened
as
she
answered:"Yes
—
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
you
will
see
him
to
-
day
,
Kate
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
will
he
bring
Lord
Molineux
with
him
?
"
cried
the
Lady
Henriette
Marie
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"I
can
not
answer
for
that
,
"
replied
the
countess
,
with
a
smile
.
"
<EOS>
But
make
yourself
easy
.
<EOS>
Unless
Lord
Molineux
is
obliged
to
remain
at
Wigan
—
which
I
think
unlikely
—
he
will
certainly
come
.
<EOS>
""Oh
!
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
,
"
cried
Henriette
.
<EOS>
"
But
what
was
that
?
<EOS>
I
thought
I
heard
a
noise
in
the
outer
court
.
<EOS>
They
may
have
arrived
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
go
forth
and
see?""No
!
<EOS>
stay
where
you
are
!
<EOS>
We
shall
learn
presently
.
<EOS>
"It
was
evident
from
the
sounds
that
an
arrival
had
taken
place
,
and
the
countess
herself
could
scarcely
control
her
impatience
,
when
Doctor
Rutter
entered
the
hall
,
and
hastened
towards
her
.
<EOS>
His
looks
showed
that
he
brought
some
important
intelligence
.
<EOS>
"Prepare
<EOS>
yourself
for
a
great
surprise
,
madam
,
"
said
the
chaplain
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
scarce
credit
me
when
I
inform
you
that
the
queen
has
just
arrived
at
the
castle
.
""Impossible
!
<EOS>
her
majesty
is
at
York
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"She
<EOS>
is
at
this
moment
in
the
court
-
yard
of
the
castle
,
"
replied
the
chaplain
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
spoken
to
her
myself
.
<EOS>
She
has
just
come
from
York
,
and
is
proceeding
to
Chester
.
<EOS>
She
is
attended
by
Lord
Goring
and
Lord
Jermyn
and
a
small
escort
.
<EOS>
""She
runs
great
risk
in
passing
thus
through
Lancashire
,
"
cried
the
countess
,
who
had
listened
in
astonishment
to
what
was
told
her
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
must
not
sit
here
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
,
girls
,
"
she
added
to
her
daughters
,
who
were
equally
astonished
with
herself
.
<EOS>
Without
waiting
to
give
any
orders
to
Master
Cunliffe
,
the
major
-
domo
,
who
had
now
made
his
appearance
with
Daniel
Trioche
,
the
earl
's
confidential
attendant
,
and
several
other
servants
,
she
hastened
forth
,
accompanied
by
her
daughters
and
Doctor
Rutter
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIQueen
Henrietta
MariaTHE
<EOS>
court
-
yard
was
full
of
soldiers
,
for
the
garrison
had
turned
out
at
once
as
soon
they
became
aware
that
the
queen
had
arrived
,
and
shouts
rent
the
air
,
while
drums
were
beaten
and
trumpets
blown
.
<EOS>
Her
majesty
had
just
dismounted
from
her
palfrey
,
being
assisted
by
Lord
Goring
,
who
was
now
standing
beside
her
.
<EOS>
Close
behind
were
Lord
Jermyn
,
Sir
Edward
Dering
,
and
several
other
Cavaliers
of
inferior
rank
.
<EOS>
Behind
them
was
the
escort
,
which
consisted
only
of
a
party
of
fifty
well
-
armed
men
.
<EOS>
Not
far
from
the
queen
stood
Captain
Chisenhale
,
Captain
Rawsthorne
,
and
Captain
Ogle
,
with
other
officers
of
the
garrison
,
who
were
waiting
to
conduct
her
majesty
to
the
hall
;
but
on
the
appearance
of
the
countess
and
her
daughters
they
stopped
,
and
formed
themselves
into
two
lines
.
<EOS>
Despite
the
constant
anxiety
she
had
recently
experienced
,
Queen
Henrietta
Maria
looked
remarkably
well
.
<EOS>
Possessing
great
courage
and
spirit
,
she
never
succumbed
to
difficulties
and
dangers
.
<EOS>
Her
personal
charms
were
still
unimpaired
,
her
fine
black
eyes
being
brilliant
as
ever
,
and
her
tresses
as
dark
and
lustrous
as
when
she
first
met
her
royal
husband
.
<EOS>
Her
features
had
lost
none
of
their
beauty
.
<EOS>
Though
not
tall
,
the
queen
was
perfectly
proportioned
,
and
remarkable
for
grace
.
<EOS>
Her
majesty
wore
a
riding
dress
of
green
velvet
embroidered
with
gold
,
and
a
broad
-
leaved
Spanish
hat
,
with
a
white
plume
,
secured
by
a
diamond
buckle
.
<EOS>
As
the
countess
approached
,
she
advanced
to
meet
her
,
and
prevented
her
from
making
an
obeisance
—
professing
herself
delighted
to
see
her
and
her
daughters
.
<EOS>
The
discourse
that
took
place
between
her
majesty
and
Lady
Derby
was
conducted
in
French
.
<EOS>
"You
are
right
welcome
to
Lathom
,
gracious
madam
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
my
noble
husband
's
name
,
I
place
the
castle
,
and
all
within
it
—
men
,
munitions
,
and
stores
—
at
your
entire
disposal
.
<EOS>
Your
majesty
has
only
to
give
your
orders
and
they
will
be
obeyed
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
,
dearest
countess
,
"
replied
the
queen
,
very
much
touched
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
your
devotion
to
the
king
and
myself
,
and
should
feel
perfectly
secure
at
Lathom
,
which
I
now
find
is
quite
as
strong
as
it
has
been
represented
to
me
,
but
I
do
not
propose
to
stay
here
long
.
<EOS>
I
am
on
the
way
to
Chester
,
and
shall
proceed
thence
to
Oxford
to
join
the
king
.
<EOS>
My
object
in
coming
here
was
to
consult
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
but
I
find
he
is
absent
.
<EOS>
""His
<EOS>
lordship
is
momently
expected
from
Wigan
,
gracious
madam
,
"
replied
the
countess
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
will
at
once
despatch
a
messenger
to
him
on
a
fleet
horse
to
acquaint
him
with
your
arrival
.
<EOS>
""Since
<EOS>
you
expect
him
that
is
sufficient
,
"
said
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
wait
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
glad
to
pass
a
short
time
with
you
and
your
fair
daughters
.
<EOS>
How
well
they
are
looking
,
"
she
added
,
smiling
graciously
upon
them
,
and
embracing
each
in
turn
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
know
that
you
are
my
goddaughter
?
<EOS>
"
she
remarked
to
the
eldest
.
<EOS>
"Indeed
<EOS>
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
proud
of
being
named
after
your
majesty
,
"
replied
Henriette
,
blushing
deeply
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
not
much
to
offer
you
,
mignonne
,
for
I
have
sold
all
my
jewels
to
help
the
king
.
<EOS>
But
I
pray
you
wear
this
ring
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
as
she
spoke
she
took
off
a
ring
and
placed
it
on
Henriette
's
finger
.
<EOS>
"I
will
never
part
with
it
,
gracious
madam
,
"
said
the
noble
damsel
,
delighted
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
passing
,
the
countess
addressed
Lord
Goring
,
Lord
Jermyn
,
Sir
Edward
Dering
,
and
the
rest
of
the
queen
's
attendants
,
and
bade
them
welcome
with
the
refined
courtesy
<EOS>
she
knew
so
well
how
to
practise
.
<EOS>
All
the
Cavaliers
were
splendidly
accoutred
,
and
made
a
very
gallant
show
in
their
glittering
cuirasses
,
richly
embroidered
baldricks
,
scarves
,
and
plumed
hats
.
<EOS>
As
we
have
said
,
the
two
nobles
were
accounted
the
handsomest
men
belonging
to
the
Court
,
and
were
especial
favourites
of
the
queen
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
believed
they
were
secretly
hostile
to
him
,
and
though
the
countess
entertained
the
same
impression
,
she
did
not
allow
it
to
influence
her
reception
of
them
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
the
major
-
domo
,
with
two
yeomen
-
ushers
,
all
three
bearing
white
wands
,
came
up
,
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
her
majesty
to
the
house
,
and
the
queen
was
about
to
proceed
thither
,
when
an
interruption
occurred
.
<EOS>
Trumpets
were
blown
from
the
summit
of
the
gate
-
house
,
announcing
the
Earl
of
Derby
's
return
,
and
,
on
hearing
these
sounds
,
the
queen
remained
stationary
.
<EOS>
Immediately
afterwards
the
great
gates
were
thrown
open
,
and
the
earl
,
with
Lord
Molineux
,
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
,
Sir
John
Girlington
,
and
closely
attended
by
Captain
Standish
,
rode
into
the
court
,
followed
by
a
large
troop
of
horse
.
<EOS>
Loud
shouts
at
the
same
time
arose
from
the
garrison
,
who
were
rejoiced
to
behold
their
lord
again
.
<EOS>
Great
was
Lord
Derby
's
surprise
when
he
found
the
place
occupied
as
we
have
described
;
but
the
moment
he
learnt
that
the
queen
was
present
,
he
flung
himself
from
the
saddle
,
and
made
his
way
to
the
spot
where
she
was
standing
,
followed
by
Lord
Molineux
and
the
others
.
"Welcome
!
<EOS>
thrice
welcome
!
<EOS>
gracious
madam
,
"
he
cried
,
bending
the
knee
before
her
.
"
<EOS>
Lathom
is
greatly
honoured
by
this
unlooked
-
for
visit
.
<EOS>
Could
I
have
anticipated
it
,
I
would
have
made
every
preparation
for
your
reception
!
<EOS>
But
I
frankly
own
<EOS>
I
did
not
expect
to
find
your
majesty
here
.
<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
had
I
any
such
intention
when
I
left
York
,
my
lord
,
"
she
replied
,
praying
him
to
rise
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
explain
the
object
of
my
visit
anon
.
<EOS>
For
a
time
I
place
myself
under
your
care
,
knowing
I
shall
be
well
guarded
by
the
loyal
Earl
of
Derby,""Your
majesty
<EOS>
is
as
safe
here
as
you
were
at
York
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
Deign
to
enter
the
house
.
<EOS>
"Then
bowing
haughtily
to
the
Lords
Goring
and
Jermyn
,
he
conducted
her
majesty
towards
the
entrance
of
the
house
,
preceded
by
the
major
-
domo
and
the
ushers
—
a
large
retinue
of
servants
having
ranged
themselves
on
either
side
of
the
steps
.
<EOS>
Seeing
that
the
queen
desired
to
confer
with
him
in
private
,
Lord
Derby
led
her
to
the
lower
end
of
the
presence
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
No
one
followed
them
.
<EOS>
All
the
courtiers
and
Royalist
gentlemen
remained
with
the
countess
,
in
the
centre
of
the
large
apartment
.
<EOS>
"Madam
,
"
said
the
earl
,
"
I
am
prepared
to
listen
to
aught
your
majesty
may
have
to
say
to
me
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
lord
,
"
said
the
queen
,
after
a
brief
pause
,
"
I
am
aware
that
your
loyalty
has
been
heavily
taxed
,
and
very
inadequately
rewarded
—
but
I
must
put
it
to
a
further
test
.
<EOS>
""Hesitate
not
to
command
me
,
madam
.
<EOS>
Aught
I
can
do
for
his
majesty
and
yourself
shall
be
done
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
,
indeed
,
a
noble
and
a
generous
heart
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
told
you
deeply
resented
some
supposed
injuries
done
you
,
and
attributed
them
to
my
influence
with
the
king
.
<EOS>
But
I
resolved
to
trust
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
here
—
in
your
stronghold
.
<EOS>
Were
you
the
traitor
<EOS>
your
enemies
would
have
me
believe
,
you
could
deliver
me
up
,
and
make
your
own
terms
with
the
Parliament
.
<EOS>
""Those
who
have
charged
me
with
treasonable
designs
have
belied
me
,
madam
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
,
with
difficulty
controlling
himself
,
and
speaking
with
forced
calmness
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
not
the
moment
to
call
them
to
account
,
but
the
time
will
come
when
I
will
force
them
to
confess
the
falsehood
.
<EOS>
I
will
make
no
idle
professions
of
loyalty
.
<EOS>
My
acts
speak
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
But
thus
much
I
will
say
—
I
am
ready
to
sacrifice
my
life
for
the
king
,
and
all
my
possessions
are
at
his
majesty
's
disposal
.
<EOS>
With
such
feelings
could
I
prove
faithless
to
your
majesty?""No
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
queen
,
emphatically
;
"
nor
did
I
ever
suspect
you
of
treachery
.
<EOS>
But
let
us
dismiss
this
matter
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
to
you
for
aid
,
and
I
do
not
think
you
will
refuse
it
me
.
<EOS>
""Assuredly
<EOS>
not
,
madam
,
"
said
the
earl
;
"
you
shall
have
all
the
aid
I
can
give
you
,
either
in
men
or
money
.
<EOS>
""It
is
the
latter
that
I
want
,
my
lord
,
"
rejoined
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"
The
king
's
necessities
are
very
great
—
greater
even
than
you
imagine
.
<EOS>
Your
lordship
is
aware
that
I
sold
all
my
jewels
and
plate
in
Holland
,
and
though
a
very
large
sum
was
raised
by
this
sacrifice
—
for
sacrifice
it
was
—
more
—
much
more
—
is
needed
.
<EOS>
""My
coffers
are
not
so
well
filled
as
I
could
desire
,
madam
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
But
all
I
have
is
yours
.
<EOS>
""With
<EOS>
how
much
can
you
supply
me
,
my
lord?""Not
more
than
a
thousand
pounds
,
madam
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"Cannot
a
larger
sum
be
borrowed
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
with
a
look
of
deep
disappointment
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
may
,
perhaps
,
be
able
to
obtain
two
or
three
thousand
more
from
Sir
Alexander
Radcliffe
of
Ordsall
Hall
,
near
Manchester
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
If
your
majesty
can
remain
here
till
to
-
morrow
,
I
will
send
off
a
trusty
messenger
to
him
forthwith
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
matter
is
so
important
to
the
king
,
my
lord
,
that
I
must
needs
wait
,
"
said
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"
But
can
not
Lord
Molineux
aid
us?""I
fear
not
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Lancashire
,
Royalists
have
no
funds
.
<EOS>
""'T
is
everywhere
the
same
,
"
said
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"
The
two
noblemen
with
me
,
and
Sir
Edward
Dering
,
have
nothing
,
or
next
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
""I
will
speak
to
Sir
John
Girlington
and
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
presently
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
with
your
majesty
's
permission
I
will
first
send
off
the
messenger
to
Ordsall
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
pray
you
do
so
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
queen
.
<EOS>
Having
conducted
her
majesty
to
the
countess
,
the
earl
proceeded
to
his
cabinet
,
taking
with
him
Doctor
Rutter
,
to
whom
he
imparted
his
design
.
<EOS>
"Shall
<EOS>
I
send
Frank
Standish
,
or
Captain
Bootle
on
the
errand
?
<EOS>
"
remarked
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
Give
me
your
advice
,
<EOS>
Rutter?""Captain
<EOS>
Bootle
,
I
think
,
will
be
the
best
,
my
lord
,
"
rejoined
the
chaplain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
more
cautious
than
Standish
,
and
will
run
no
needless
risk
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
Standish
is
well
known
to
the
Manchester
Roundheads
,
and
would
be
recognised
if
he
chanced
to
encounter
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
""You
are
right
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
not
be
prudent
to
send
him
.
<EOS>
While
I
write
to
Sir
Alexander
Radcliffe
,
go
fetch
Captain
Bootle
,
and
explain
the
business
to
him
.
<EOS>
"While
<EOS>
Rutter
went
in
quest
of
the
messenger
,
Lord
Derby
sat
down
at
a
table
on
which
writing
materials
were
laid
,
and
had
just
finished
his
letter
,
when
the
chaplain
returned
with
Bootle
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bootle
's
looks
seemed
scarcely
to
warrant
the
confidence
placed
in
him
by
the
earl
and
Doctor
Rutter
,
for
there
was
something
sinister
in
the
expression
of
his
countenance
,
caused
by
a
slight
obliquity
of
vision
,
but
he
was
brave
and
active
,
and
esteemed
a
staunch
Royalist
.
<EOS>
He
was
fully
accoutred
in
breastplate
and
helmet
,
and
his
stout
riding
-
boots
were
drawn
above
the
knee
.
<EOS>
Besides
the
long
sword
by
his
side
he
had
pistols
in
his
belt
.
<EOS>
"Has
<EOS>
Doctor
Rutter
explained
why
I
have
sent
for
you
,
Captain
Bootle
?
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
You
desire
me
to
take
a
letter
to
Sir
Alexander
Radcliffe
of
Ordsall
Hall
,
and
to
bring
back
a
large
sum
of
money
.
<EOS>
""There
is
much
risk
in
the
expedition
,
"
observed
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
Take
a
strong
guard
with
you
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
I
take
a
strong
guard
,
my
lord
,
I
shall
probably
be
attacked
,
and
may
be
plundered
,
"
said
Bootle
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
go
alone
;
I
can
reach
the
hall
then
unobserved
.
<EOS>
""As
<EOS>
you
will
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
mind
,
you
will
incur
a
great
responsibility
.
<EOS>
""I
believe
it
to
be
the
safest
course
,
"
remarked
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"I
am
sure
it
is
,
"
said
Bootle
.
<EOS>
The
earl
did
not
seem
altogether
satisfied
,
but
he
gave
him
the
letter
,
adding
,
"
Set
out
at
once
,
and
use
all
the
despatch
you
can
.
<EOS>
Sir
Alexander
will
furnish
you
with
another
horse
,
and
if
he
deems
it
needful
,
will
send
a
guard
with
you
.
"Captain
<EOS>
Bootle
bowed
and
withdrew
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
,
he
had
quitted
the
hall
,
and
was
speeding
in
the
direction
of
Wigan
,
whither
<EOS>
it
was
supposed
he
had
been
sent
,
for
none
,
<EOS>
save
those
concerned
in
it
,
were
aware
of
the
real
nature
of
his
errand
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIIWhat
the
Queen
beheld
from
the
Eagle
TowerAs
<EOS>
it
was
now
known
that
the
queen
intended
to
remain
at
Lathom
till
the
following
day
,
arrangements
were
immediately
made
for
the
accommodation
of
her
majesty
and
her
suite
.
<EOS>
This
was
accomplished
without
the
slightest
difficulty
,
since
there
were
an
immense
number
of
rooms
in
the
mansion
,
as
will
readily
be
understood
,
when
we
mention
that
more
than
two
hundred
guests
with
their
attendants
had
often
been
lodged
within
it
.
<EOS>
To
the
queen
was
assigned
a
noble
apartment
in
the
grand
gallery
,
the
walls
of
which
were
hung
with
the
choicest
arras
,
while
the
bedstead
presented
a
magnificent
specimen
of
carved
oak
.
<EOS>
Amid
the
painted
glass
of
the
bay
window
was
a
portrait
of
the
Countess
of
Richmond
,
mother
of
Henry
the
Seventh
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
inferior
were
the
rooms
allotted
to
the
principal
personages
in
attendance
upon
her
majesty
.
<EOS>
As
we
have
said
,
the
apartments
were
truly
regal
,
Henry
the
Seventh
's
palace
at
Shene
being
modelled
upon
Lathom
.
<EOS>
Even
the
queen
was
struck
with
the
princely
character
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
As
to
her
majesty
's
guard
,
they
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
their
quarters
.
<EOS>
After
a
plentiful
repast
had
been
served
in
the
great
banqueting
-
hall
,
the
queen
inspected
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
Except
the
musketeers
and
artillerymen
on
the
walls
,
the
whole
of
the
men
,
fully
armed
and
accoutred
,
and
having
an
officer
at
the
head
of
each
company
,
were
drawn
up
in
the
court
-
yard
,
and
presented
a
very
imposing
sight
.
<EOS>
Accustomed
to
such
displays
,
the
queen
was
able
to
judge
of
their
efficiency
.
<EOS>
"You
are
better
served
than
his
majesty
,
my
lord
,
"
she
remarked
to
the
Earl
of
Derby
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
such
troops
as
these
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
""I
have
reason
to
be
proud
of
them
,
gracious
madam
,
for
they
are
all
my
retainers
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
ready
to
fight
for
his
majesty
when
called
upon
.
<EOS>
But
methinks
they
are
best
employed
in
the
defence
of
this
castle
,
which
helps
to
sustain
the
royal
cause
in
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
""When
<EOS>
my
husband
is
absent
I
have
charge
of
the
castle
,
"
said
the
countess
;
"
and
your
majesty
may
rest
assured
it
shall
never
be
surrendered
to
rebels
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
fear
of
that
,
"
rejoined
the
queen
.
<EOS>
Before
quitting
the
court
,
the
troops
marched
past
the
queen
,
and
manifested
great
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
Her
majesty
next
visited
the
stables
,
which
,
though
large
enough
to
hold
a
hundred
horses
,
were
now
quite
full
.
<EOS>
From
the
stables
she
proceeded
to
the
magazine
and
provision
stores
,
and
was
surprised
at
the
extent
of
the
supplies
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
majesty
sees
we
are
not
unprepared
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
castle
in
England
can
be
in
better
condition
,
"
replied
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
not
yet
completed
my
survey
.
<EOS>
From
the
summit
of
that
lofty
tower
I
could
see
the
whole
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
""Your
majesty
would
find
the
ascent
fatiguing
,
"
remarked
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
advise
you
to
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
""I
make
no
doubt
the
countess
often
goes
there
,
"
said
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"Twice
<EOS>
a
day
regularly
,
madam
,
"
rejoined
Lady
Derby
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
the
effort
can
not
be
too
great
for
me
!
"
cried
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"
Come
with
me
all
who
list
.
<EOS>
My
lord
,
I
place
myself
under
your

"The
<EOS>
Eagle
Tower
towards
which
Lord
Derby
conducted
the
queen
was
situated
in
the
centre
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
In
the
lower
part
there
was
a
guard
-
room
wherein
half
a
dozen
musketeers
were
now
assembled
.
<EOS>
From
this
chamber
a
wide
staircase
,
that
followed
each
angle
of
the
tower
,
gradually
mounted
to
the
summit
.
<EOS>
So
easy
was
the
ascent
that
the
queen
accomplished
it
without
the
slightest
fatigue
.
<EOS>
On
the
appearance
of
the
earl
and
his
illustrious
visitor
,
the
two
sentinels
stationed
on
the
leads
retired
.
<EOS>
Now
that
the
whole
of
the
castle
was
spread
out
before
her
,
the
queen
was
surprised
at
the
size
of
the
fabric
.
<EOS>
With
the
various
buildings
and
walls
it
looked
like
a
strongly
fortified
town
.
<EOS>
Lord
Goring
and
Lord
Jermyn
,
and
her
majesty
's
other
attendants
,
were
equally
amazed
.
<EOS>
A
smile
of
satisfaction
played
upon
Lady
Derby
's
countenance
,
but
the
earl
maintained
an
immovable
demeanour
.
<EOS>
The
queen
was
no
careless
and
superficial
observer
.
<EOS>
Not
content
with
a
mere
glance
at
the
place
,
she
minutely
examined
the
fortifications
—
noted
the
immense
thickness
of
the
walls
,
and
the
strong
internal
earthworks
—
numbered
the
towers
and
counted
the
ordnance
—
and
bestowed
a
second
look
of
scrutiny
upon
the
lofty
gatehouse
.
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
the
Earl
of
Derby
;
she
remarked:"This
is
a
strong
castle
,
my
lord
—
much
stronger
than
I
thought
.
<EOS>
""It
was
built
by
my
ancestor
,
the
second
Lord
Stanley
,
and
first
Lord
Derby
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
strong
place
then
—
but
I
have
made
it
somewhat
stronger
.
<EOS>
""To
me
<EOS>
it
seems
impregnable
,
"
remarked
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
guard
against
treachery
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
we
have
no
traitors
at
Lathom
,
gracious
madam
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
Before
descending
,
the
queen
surveyed
the
surrounding
district
.
<EOS>
Owing
to
the
fine
weather
that
prevailed
,
the
view
was
seen
to
great
advantage
.
<EOS>
The
lofty
position
on
which
she
stood
enabled
her
to
overlook
the
rising
ground
on
the
south
side
of
the
moat
,
and
beyond
the
park
she
beheld
a
vast
moor
,
almost
uncultivated
and
entirely
destitute
of
timber
,
that
extended
nearly
to
Knowsley
.
<EOS>
On
the
north
was
another
park
,
in
the
midst
of
which
was
<EOS>
Burscough
Priory
,
a
reverend
pile
,
founded
some
four
or
five
centuries
ago
by
the
Lathoms
,
but
now
completely
deserted
,
except
by
a
few
poor
bedesmen
,
who
were
allowed
to
occupy
it
.
<EOS>
The
picturesque
structure
,
however
,
did
not
escape
the
queen
's
eye
,
and
she
put
some
questions
respecting
it
.
<EOS>
On
the
west
was
New
Hall
,
a
small
mansion
belonging
to
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
now
untenanted
,
and
beyond
it
,
above
the
trees
,
could
be
distinguished
the
spire
of
the
old
church
of
Ormskirk
,
in
the
vaults
of
which
Earl
William
had
recently
been
laid
beside
his
ancestors
.
<EOS>
On
the
east
,
a
range
of
hills
shut
out
the
view
in
the
direction
of
Wigan
.
<EOS>
Owing
to
the
large
tract
of
moss
and
moor
,
the
country
had
generally
a
wild
and
sterile
look
—
but
portions
of
the
prospect
were
extremely
picturesque
and
beautiful
.
<EOS>
The
parks
contained
much
fine
timber
,
and
were
well
stocked
with
deer
.
<EOS>
Up
to
a
late
period
the
Lord
of
Lathom
and
Knowsley
had
been
devoted
to
the
chase
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
the
queen
remained
gazing
on
this
prospect
—
turning
from
one
side
to
the
other
and
questioning
the
earl
as
to
any
objects
that
interested
her
.
<EOS>
After
studying
the
locality
in
this
manner
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
no
better
situation
for
a
stronghold
could
have
been
chosen
.
<EOS>
The
two
nobles
in
attendance
upon
her
majesty
made
few
remarks
,
and
held
aloof
while
she
was
conversing
with
the
earl
.
<EOS>
In
the
evening
a
banquet
,
distinguished
by
as
much
splendour
as
had
formerly
characterised
Lord
Derby
's
entertainments
,
took
place
in
the
great
hall
.
<EOS>
In
the
centre
of
the
dais
,
under
a
canopy
,
sat
the
queen
,
and
all
the
most
important
personages
then
staying
within
the
mansion
were
placed
on
her
right
and
left
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
waited
upon
her
majesty
in
person
.
<EOS>
Nearly
a
hundred
persons
sat
down
at
the
lower
tables
—
all
the
officers
of
the
garrison
being
present
.
<EOS>
Thus
filled
and
illumined
with
torches
,
the
hall
presented
a
magnificent
sight
.
<EOS>
The
richest
liveries
were
worn
by
the
servants
,
and
strains
of
minstrelsy
were
heard
from
the
galleries
.
<EOS>
Trumpets
were
blown
when
certain
large
dishes
were
set
upon
the
tables
,
and
many
old
and
long
-
neglected
customs
were
observed
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
IVHow
Gertrude
Rosworm
arrived
at
Lathom
HouseTHE
<EOS>
Earl
of
Derby
's
confident
expectation
that
Captain
Bootle
would
return
at
an
early
hour
on
the
following
morning
was
not
realised
.
<EOS>
Not
till
nearly
noon
did
the
messenger
make
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
Nor
had
he
been
successful
in
his
errand
.
<EOS>
Sir
Alexander
Radcliffe
was
absent
from
Ordsall
,
and
,
consequently
,
the
money
could
not
be
procured
.
<EOS>
The
queen
was
greatly
disappointed
at
the
result
of
the
expedition
,
and
scarcely
seemed
satisfied
with
Bootle
's
excuses
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
gone
she
remarked
to
the
earl:"I
do
not
like
that
man
's
looks
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
could
have
brought
the
money
if
he
would
.
<EOS>
""He
could
only
have
obtained
it
from
Sir
Alexander
himself
,
madam
,
and
unfortunately
he
was
absent
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
he
would
have
returned
to
-
night
,
"
cried
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"
The
messenger
ought
to
have
waited
.
<EOS>
""Doubtless
<EOS>
he
would
have
waited
,
but
for
the
special
orders
given
him
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
your
majesty
can
be
induced
to
prolong
your
stay
I
will
send
off
another
messenger
at
once
.
<EOS>
""It
will
be
well
to
do
so
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
queen
.
<EOS>
Just
then
,
Captain
Standish
entered
the
cabinet
wherein
the
foregoing
discourse
had
taken
place
between
the
queen
and
Lord
Derby
.
"Pardon
<EOS>
this
intrusion
,
gracious
madam
,
"
said
Standish
,
bowing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
youth
has
just
arrived
at
the
castle
from
Manchester
,
who
has
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
to
communicate
to
your
majesty
.
<EOS>
""From
Manchester
,
say
you
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
may
be
from
Sir
Alexander
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
""No
,
madam
,
the
youth
is
not
from
Ordsall
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
then
you
know
his
errand
?
"
cried
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"Of
<EOS>
thus
much
,
I
am
certain
,
gracious
madam
—
he
brings
no
message
from
Sir
Alexander
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
is
acquainted
with
the
youth
,
who
has
rendered
him
some
slight
service
.
<EOS>
""Who
<EOS>
is
he
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
calls
himself
Karl
Rosworm
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
lordship
will
recognise
him
at
once!""Rosworm
!
"
exclaimed
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
that
is
the
name
of
the
famous
German
engineer
,
by
whom
Manchester
has
been
fortified
.
<EOS>
""And
if
I
am
not
wrong
in
my
suspicions
,
"
said
the
earl
,
a
slight
smile
crossing
his
features
,
"
<EOS>
this
Karl
Rosworm
is
a
near
relative
of
the
engineer
.
<EOS>
But
your
majesty
may
safely
see
the
youth
.
<EOS>
""He
is
without
,
gracious
madam
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"Admit
<EOS>
him
,
then
,
"
said
the
queen
.
<EOS>
In
another
minute
,
a
youth
of
very
prepossessing
appearance
entered
the
cabinet
,
and
bowed
deeply
to
the
queen
.
<EOS>
His
light
locks
flowed
over
his
shoulders
,
and
heightened
the
delicate
and
almost
feminine
character
of
his
features
.
<EOS>
He
was
habited
in
a
riding
-
dress
,
and
the
dusty
state
of
his
boots
showed
he
had
travelled
far
.
<EOS>
After
bringing
this
youth
into
the
royal
presence
,
Standish
would
have
retired
,
but
the
queen
signed
to
him
to
stay
.
"Attempt
<EOS>
not
to
deceive
me
,
"
she
said
to
the
new
-
corner
,
"
you
are
not
what
you
seem
.
<EOS>
""Pardon
<EOS>
me
,
I
pray
your
majesty
,
for
appearing
before
you
in
this
disguise
,
"
said
Gertrude
,
for
it
was
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
required
it
to
come
hither
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
daughter
of
Colonel
Rosworm
,
but
I
am
a
Royalist
at
heart
,
as
I
hope
to
prove
.
<EOS>
A
plot
has
been
contrived
in
Manchester
against
your
majesty
,
and
I
have
come
hither
—
at
some
hazard
to
myself
—
to
warn
you
of
it
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
thank
you
for
your
zeal
,
"
replied
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
how
such
a
plot
can
have
originated
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
majesty
's
movements
are
better
known
than
you
imagine
,
"
said
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
known
to
Colonel
Holland
and
some
of
the
Manchester
garrison
that
your
majesty
is
staying
at
Lathom
,
and
an
attempt
will
be
made
to
capture
you
.
<EOS>
An
ambuscade
will
be
formed
into
which
it
is
hoped
you
may
fall
when
you
quit
the
castle
.
<EOS>
Fearing
the
design
might
prove
successful
,
I
have
come
to
warn
you
of
it
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
thank
you
heartily
for
the
great
service
rendered
me
,
"
said
the
queen
,
"
and
will
requite
it
.
<EOS>
How
can
Colonel
Holland
have
obtained
this
information
?
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
to
Lord
Derby
.
"
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
Tis
certain
we
have
been
betrayed
.
<EOS>
But
by
whom
?
<EOS>
My
own
suspicions
alight
on
Captain
Bootle
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
believe
him
capable
of
such
villainy
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
shall
at
once
be
placed
under
arrest
.
<EOS>
Your
majesty
can
then
interrogate
him
.
<EOS>
See
it
done
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
to
Standish
,
who
forthwith
departed
on
the
errand
.
"But
<EOS>
for
this
unlooked
-
for
and
untoward
incident
,
"
said
the
earl
,
"
I
would
have
sent
a
second
messenger
to
Ordsall
;
but
it
would
not
be
prudent
to
do
so
,
since
he
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
""Trouble
<EOS>
yourself
no
more
about
the
matter
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
now
need
an
additional
guard
to
Warrington
.
<EOS>
""I
will
attend
your
majesty
myself
with
a
strong
guard
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
the
enemy
will
venture
to
attack
us
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
juncture
,
Frank
Standish
returned
.
<EOS>
But
he
brought
no
prisoner
with
him
.
<EOS>
"Where
is
Captain
Bootle
?
"
demanded
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"He
has
fled
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"Fled
!
"
ejaculated
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
proclaims
his
guilt
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
arrival
of
this
disguised
damsel
seems
to
have
alarmed
him
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Feeling
sure
that
a
discovery
must
take
place
,
he
mounted
his
horse
,
and
quitted
the
castle
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
why
was
he
suffered
to
depart
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
earl
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"No
suspicions
were
entertained
of
him
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
declared
he
was
sent
with
a
pressing
message
by
your
lordship
.
<EOS>
""I
will
hang
the
false
traitor
if
I
catch
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
doubt
he
has
gone
to
join
Colonel
Holland
and
the
rebels
,
and
will
direct
their
design
,
"
said
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"A
plan
occurs
to
me
by
which
this
design
might
be
effectually
defeated
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
if
your
majesty
will
approve
of
the
plan
,
but
with
your
permission
I
will
mention
it
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
us
hear
it
,
"
said
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"This
damsel
must
play
a
part
in
it
,
"
rejoined
Standish
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
she
must
personate
your
majesty
.
<EOS>
""Personate
me
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
success
of
the
scheme
depends
upon
the
disguise
,
gracious
madam
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
a
small
party
of
horse
,
and
accompanied
by
this
damsel
—
disguised
as
I
have
ventured
to
suggest
—
I
will
undertake
to
lure
Colonel
Holland
and
his
men
from
their
ambuscade
,
and
it
shall
not
be
my
fault
if
they
have
not
a
long
chase
,
and
in
a
wrong
direction
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
scheme
promises
well
,
"
remarked
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
how
say
you
,
fair
maiden
?
<EOS>
"
she
added
to
Gertrude
.
"
<EOS>
Are
you
willing
to
take
part
in
it?""Nothing
would
please
me
better
,
madam
,
"
was
the
eager
reply,"Then
<EOS>
be
it
so
,
"
said
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
plan
can
not
be
carried
out
with
any
chance
of
success
till
night
,
"
said
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
who
had
listened
to
Standish
's
proposition
in
silence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
your
majesty
content
to
remain
here
till
then?""I
do
not
care
for
the
delay
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
inform
my
council
of
my
design
.
<EOS>
""Lord
<EOS>
Goring
and
Lord
Jermyn
are
in
the
banqueting
-
hall
with
the
countess
,
"
said
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
summon
them?""No
<EOS>
,
I
will
go
thither
,
"
said
the
queen

<EOS>
"
Come
with
me
,
fair
demoiselle
,
"
she
added
graciously
to
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
provide
you
with
a
fitting
disguise

by
a
party
of
well
-
mounted
men
-
at
-
arms
.
<EOS>
They
took
the
road
to
Wigan
,
and
had
not
proceeded
more
than
two
miles
,
when
they
entered
a
wood
.
<EOS>
It
was
here
that
Standish
expected
the
attack
would
be
made
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
wrong
in
the
calculation
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
advanced
far
when
the
trampling
of
a
large
body
of
horse
was
heard
behind
them
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
an
officer
,
who
was
recognised
as
Bootle
,
galloped
quickly
up
,
and
shouted
to
them
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
know
the
queen
is
with
you
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
She
can
not
escape
.
<EOS>
Yield
her
up
quietly
,
and
your
lives
shall
be
spared
.
<EOS>
""We
will
part
with
life
sooner
than
yield
up
our
charge
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
we
will
cut
you
in
pieces
and
take
her
,
"
cried
Bootle
.
<EOS>
"You
will
never
assist
at
her
capture
,
villain
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
Take
the
reward
of
your
treachery
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
plucking
a
pistol
from
his
belt
,
he
fired
,
and
Bootle
fell
from
his
horse
,
though
not
mortally
wounded
.
<EOS>
After
this
incident
,
Standish
and
his
men
continued
to
gallop
on
,
but
their
progress
was
soon
checked
by
another
large
party
of
Parliamentary
troopers
who
were
drawn
across
the
road
.
"Yield
!
<EOS>
"
shouted
Colonel
Holland
,
who
commanded
the
party
in
front
.
<EOS>
"
If
a
single
shot
be
fired
,
every
man
shall
be
put
to
death
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
riding
up
to
Standish
,
he
said:"I
know
you
are
escorting
the
queen
to
Warrington
.
<EOS>
Where
is
she?"Standish
made
no
reply
,
and
Colonel
Holland
repeated
the
question
in
a
yet
more
authoritative
and
menacing
tone
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
her
majesty
were
here
<EOS>
I
would
never
deliver
her
up
to
you
with
life
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"This
denial
is
useless
,
"
said
Holland
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
see
her
yonder
,
surrounded
by
your
men
,
who
vainly
attempt
to
hide
her
.
<EOS>
""That
is
not
the
queen
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Satisfy
yourself
on
the
point
.
<EOS>
""I
am
satisfied
,
"
rejoined
Colonel
Holland
.
<EOS>
"
I
require
no
further
proof
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
time
enough
to
put
any
questions
to
her
majesty
,
when
I
have
conveyed
her
safely
to
Manchester
.
<EOS>
You
and
your
men
must
accompany
me
thither
.
<EOS>
""As
prisoners
?
"
demanded
Standish
.
<EOS>
"As
prisoners
.
<EOS>
Resistance
would
be
useless
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
recommend
you
to
deliver
up
your
arms
quietly
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
injunction
was
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Standish
and
his
men
were
disarmed
,
but
every
respect
was
paid
to
her
whom
the
Parliamentary
leaders
supposed
to
be
the
queen
;
and
as
Gertrude
did
not
utter
a
word
,
and
was
not
required
to
remove
the
half
-
mask
that
covered
her
face
,
no
discovery
was
made
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
both
divisions
of
the
rebel
force
had
now
formed
a
junction
—
the
Royalists
being
placed
in
the
midst
,
so
that
the
important
captive
was
well
guarded
.
<EOS>
At
the
head
of
the
troop
rode
Colonel
Holland
,
and
he
now
took
a
road
across
a
moor
leading
towards
Bolton
,
whence
he
intended
to
diverge
to
Manchester
.
<EOS>
But
he
soon
found
he
was
followed
by
a
company
of
horse
,
whose
shouts
convinced
him
they
were
Royalists
.
<EOS>
Anxious
to
avoid
an
engagement
with
them
,
he
quickened
his
pace
,
but
it
soon
appeared
that
the
Cavaliers
had
the
swiftest
horses
,
for
they
speedily
overtook
the
rebels
,
and
fell
with
great
fury
on
their
rear
,
killing
several
,
and
driving
others
into
the
morass
.
<EOS>
Owing
to
the
narrowness
of
the
causeway
,
Colonel
Holland
was
unable
to
wheel
round
,
and
sustained
considerable
loss
before
he
could
reach
firm
ground
.
<EOS>
He
then
formed
as
quickly
as
he
could
,
and
prepared
to
receive
the
Royalists
,
whom
he
found
were
commanded
by
the
Earl
of
Derby
in
person
.
<EOS>
A
sharp
conflict
took
place
,
but
though
the
combatants
were
nearly
equally
matched
in
point
of
numbers
,
and
fought
well
on
both
sides
,
it
soon
became
evident
that
the
Cavaliers
were
gaining
ground
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Holland
,
therefore
,
decided
upon
a
retreat
,
but
determined
at
the
same
time
to
carry
off
his
royal
captive
,
who
was
placed
for
safety
at
the
rear
.
<EOS>
Riding
up
to
her
,
he
said:"Fortune
is
against
me
,
madam
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
may
prove
the
victor
,
but
he
shall
not
rob
me
of
my
prize
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
right
to
the
title
you
bestow
upon
me
,
"
she
rejoined
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
refuse
to
accompany
you
.
<EOS>
""Are
<EOS>
you
not
the
queen
?
<EOS>
"
he
exclaimed
,
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"Her
<EOS>
majesty
,
I
trust
,
is
safe
in
Warrington
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"Confusion
!
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Have
I
been
duped
?
<EOS>
Who
are
you
?
<EOS>
Your
voice
seems
familiar
to
me
.
<EOS>
""You
ought
to
know
me
,
Colonel
Holland
,
"
she
rejoined
,
removing
her
mask
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
often
seen
me
before
.
<EOS>
""Gertrude
Rosworm
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
leave
you
here
.
<EOS>
You
must
give
your
father
an
explanation
of
your
strange
conduct
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me!"But
before
he
could
seize
her
bridle
,
she
dashed
aside
,
and
in
another
minute
had
joined
the
Royalists
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
Colonel
Holland
and
the
Parliamentarians
were
in
full
retreat
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
pursued
them
to
the
very
gates
of
Bolton
,
and
then
returned
with
his
company
across
the
moors
to
Lathom
.
<EOS>
He
had
sustained
but
little
loss
in
the
encounter
,
though
the
rebels
suffered
heavily
.
<EOS>
In
the
confusion
of
the
fight
,
Frank
Standish
and
his
men
had
liberated
themselves
from
their
captors
,
and
recovered
their
arms
.
<EOS>
Nearly
forty
prisoners
were
taken
by
the
victors
to
Lathom
,
and
the
queen
,
who
had
not
yet
departed
,
was
greatly
rejoiced
at
the
result
of
the
engagement
.
<EOS>
Gertrude
was
regarded
as
the
heroine
of
the
day
,
and
received
high
commendations
from
her
majesty
and
the
Countess
of
Derby
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
,
the
queen
set
out
with
her
attendants
for
Chester
,
and
was
escorted
thither
by
Lord
Derby
and
a
large
party
of
horse
.
<EOS>
But
she
met
with
no
interruption
.
<EOS>
Her
majesty
proposed
to
take
Gertrude
with
her
,
but
Lady
Derby
seemed
loth
to
part
with
the
young
damsel
,
and
she
was
allowed
to
remain
.

THE
STORMING
OF
LANCASTERCHAPTER
IHoghton
TowerLORD
DERBY
remained
for
a
day
at
Chester
,
which
was
now
strongly
garrisoned
by
the
Earl
of
Rivers
,
and
then
finding
the
queen
did
not
require
his
further
services
,
returned
to
Lathom
.
<EOS>
Gladly
would
he
have
remained
tranquil
for
a
short
time
,
but
the
whole
country
was
in
so
disturbed
a
state
that
it
was
impossible
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
News
was
brought
him
that
the
important
town
of
Preston
had
been
taken
by
Sir
John
Seaton
,
Major
-
General
of
the
Parliamentary
force
,
and
that
Lancaster
was
threatened
.
<EOS>
On
receiving
this
intelligence
,
he
determined
to
hasten
to
the
assistance
of
the
Royalists
with
all
the
force
he
could
muster
,
and
leave
Lathom
to
the
charge
of
the
countess
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
he
set
out
on
the
same
day
with
a
body
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
for
Hoghton
Tower
—
a
large
castellated
mansion
belonging
to
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
,
situated
within
half
a
dozen
miles
of
Preston
.
<EOS>
Hoghton
Tower
had
been
appointed
as
a
rendezvous
of
the
Royalists
,
and
a
beacon
was
burnt
nightly
there
to
summon
them
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
finer
than
the
situation
of
this
strong
and
stately
fabric
—
<EOS>
nothing
grander
or
more
picturesque
than
its
appearance
<EOS>
;
crowning
the
summit
of
a
knoll
,
the
base
of
which
was
washed
on
one
side
by
the
river
Darwen
,
while
on
the
other
it
was
environed
by
a
large
park
,
or
rather
forest
,
abounding
in
wild
cattle
,
wild
boar
,
and
red
deer
.
<EOS>
Founded
in
the
early
part
of
Elizabeth
's
reign
by
Sir
Thomas
Hoghton
,
this
stately
structure
overlooked
the
whole
district
.
<EOS>
From
its
walls
Preston
could
be
described
on
the
heights
on
the
further
side
of
the
Ribble
,
and
the
course
of
that
noble
river
could
be
traced
from
Penwortham
to
the
Irish
Sea
—
its
broad
estuary
looking
like
a
lake
.
<EOS>
Blackburn
,
Leyland
,
Chorley
,
and
several
other
towns
were
likewise
visible
,
and
beyond
the
limits
of
the
forest
a
rich
and
fertile
country
gladdened
the
eye
.
<EOS>
Through
this
dense
wood
the
Earl
of
Derby
and
his
company
made
their
way
to
the
castle
.
<EOS>
Night
had
come
on
since
they
quitted
Chorley
,
and
the
narrow
road
,
arched
over
by
the
trees
,
seemed
profoundly
dark
,
and
when
they
emerged
from
it
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
the
beacon
fire
,
burning
above
them
,
and
illumining
the
towers
and
walls
of
the
mansion
,
produced
a
very
striking
effect
.
<EOS>
Captain
Standish
had
been
sent
on
with
a
small
party
of
men
to
announce
his
lordship
's
approach
,
so
that
when
the
earl
reached
the
outer
gate
,
he
found
it
thrown
wide
open
,
and
rode
into
the
quadrangle
without
delay
.
<EOS>
Neither
here
,
nor
elsewhere
,
were
torches
needed
,
for
the
beacon
,
placed
on
the
summit
of
the
second
gatehouse
,
which
was
much
loftier
than
the
first
,
afforded
light
enough
.
<EOS>
In
the
inner
court
were
assembled
a
number
of
servants
,
headed
by
Master
Urmston
,
the
steward
.
<EOS>
Sir
Gilbert
de
Hoghton
was
a
strict
Romanist
,
and
at
the
moment
when
Lord
Derby
arrived
,
he
was
attending
vespers
in
his
domestic
chapel
,
so
that
the
duty
of
receiving
his
lordship
devolved
upon
the
steward
,
who
performed
the
task
with
great
ceremony
.
<EOS>
After
assisting
his
lordship
to
dismount
,
he
prayed
him
to
enter
the
house
,
and
conducted
him
to
a
spacious
apartment
called
the
Green
Room
,
from
the
colour
of
its
hangings
.
<EOS>
The
room
,
which
was
well
lighted
up
,
was
richly
but
cumbrously
furnished
,
and
the
walls
were
adorned
with
portraits
of
the
ancestors
of
the
owner
of
the
mansion
—
Sir
Adam
de
Hoghton
,
who
flourished
in
the
time
of
Henry
the
Third
,
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
,
knight
of
the
shire
,
when
Edward
the
Sixth
was
king
,
and
Sir
Thomas
de
Hoghton
,
who
built
the
tower
in
the
early
days
of
Elizabeth
,
and
was
killed
at
Lea
by
the
Baron
de
Walton
.
<EOS>
Here
the
Earl
found
Lord
Molineux
,
who
had
arrived
at
the
tower
on
the
same
day
with
fifty
horse
,
and
shortly
afterwards
Sir
Gilbert
himself
appeared
.
<EOS>
In
age
the
baronet
was
about
fifty
,
and
had
a
tall
,
stately
figure
,
and
handsome
features
.
<EOS>
His
habiliments
were
of
black
velvet
,
relieved
by
a
lace
collar
.
<EOS>
"I
am
glad
your
lordship
has
brought
so
large
a
force
with
you
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Captain
Standish
tells
me
you
feared
I
should
not
be
able
to
accommodate
all
your
men
.
<EOS>
You
have
forgotten
how
many
persons
the
tower
contained
when
King
James
was
my
father
's
guest
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
other
Royalists
may
arrive
,
Sir
Gilbert
,
"
said
the
earl
;
"
and
each
will
bring
a
score
of
men
at
least
.
<EOS>
""There
is
ample
room
for
a
hundred
more
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Gilbert
.
<EOS>
"
Come
with
me
,
and
I
will
speedily
convince
you
I
am
right
.
<EOS>
"Thereupon
<EOS>
they
repaired
to
the
outer
court
,
and
found
there
was
no
lack
of
accommodation
either
for
horses
or
men
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
there
was
abundant
supply
of
provisions
.
<EOS>
As
the
earl
had
anticipated
,
several
other
Royalist
leaders
arrived
,
and
a
goodly
supper
was
served
in
the
great
hall
,
of
which
more
than
a
hundred
persons
partook
.
<EOS>
That
night
the
Earl
of
Derby
occupied
the
splendid
bedchamber
assigned
to
King
James
during
his
stay
at
the
tower
,
and
seemed
haunted
by
that
monarch
whose
portrait
was
hung
over
the
fireplace
.
<EOS>
In
a
small
adjoining
chamber
slept
Frank
Standish
.
<EOS>
Next
morning
five
hundred
countrymen
,
armed
with
bills
and
clubs
,
arrived
at
the
tower
to
join
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
They
were
drawn
up
in
the
outer
quadrangle
,
and
when
his
lordship
showed
himself
to
them
,
with
Lord
Molineux
,
they
threw
up
their
hats
,
and
shouted
lustily
,
"
God
bless
the
king
,
and
the
Earl
of
Derby
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
earl
thanked
them
heartily
for
their
zeal
and
loyalty
,
and
told
them
that
with
their
aid
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
deliver
Preston
and
Lancaster
from
the
rebels
,
upon
which
they
shouted
again
as
lustily
as
before
,
and
declared
they
were
quite
ready
to
follow
wherever
he
chose
to
lead
them
.
<EOS>
On
returning
to
the
house
,
Lord
Derby
found
Daniel
Trioche
,
his
confidential
French
servant
,
who
brought
him
a
letter
from
the
countess
informing
him
that
all
was
going
on
well
at
Lathom
.
<EOS>
The
earl
was
too
busy
at
the
time
to
write
a
reply
,
but
he
sent
a
tender
message
by
Trioche
,
telling
her
ladyship
that
he
was
just
starting
on
an
important
expedition
,
and
hoped
she
would
soon
receive
good
tidings
of
him
.
<EOS>
"Tell
her
ladyship
<EOS>
,
"
he
added
,
"
that
my
next
letter
to
her
shall
be
from
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
"Half
<EOS>
an
hour
afterwards
,
Lord
Derby
marched
from
Hoghton
Tower
at
the
head
of
four
hundred
horse
,
and
six
hundred
foot
.
<EOS>
He
was
accompanied
by
Lord
Molineux
,
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
,
and
the
other
Royalists
.
<EOS>
The
billmen
and
clubmen
were
commanded
by
Frank
Standish
and
Captain
Hoghton
—
Sir
Gilbert
's
nephew
.
<EOS>
At
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
,
Lord
Derby
learnt
that
Lancaster
had
already
been
taken
by
the
Parliamentarian
commanders
—
Colonel
Holcroft
,
Major
Sparrow
,
and
Major
Heywood
;
and
that
Preston
was
also
very
strongly
garrisoned
by
Sir
John
Seaton
,
who
had
received
large
reinforcements
from
Manchester
and
other
towns
,
and
had
now
fifteen
hundred
musketeers
and
several
troops
of
horse
.
<EOS>
After
some
consultation
with
Lord
Molineux
and
Sir
Gilbert
,
Lord
Derby
resolved
not
to
attack
either
town
,
until
he
had
augmented
his
own
forces
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
crossed
the
river
at
Penwortham
,
and
marched
into
the
Fylde
,
a
large
tract
lying
between
the
estuaries
of
the
Ribble
and
the
Wyre
,
and
took
up
his
quarters
at
Kirkham
and
Lytham
,
and
immediately
issued
warrants
commanding
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
Fylde
,
above
sixteen
and
under
sixty
,
on
pain
of
death
,
to
appear
before
him
at
Kirkham
,
armed
with
the
best
weapons
they
could
provide
.
<EOS>
The
summons
was
responded
to
by
the
whole
district
,
which
abounded
in
Romanists
,
and
in
less
than
a
week
he
was
joined
by
three
thousand
stalwart
billmen
and
clubmen
.
<EOS>
He
was
likewise
joined
by
Sir
John
Girlington
and
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
with
six
hundred
men
—
half
of
whom
were
horse
,
and
half
musketeers
.
<EOS>
Being
now
at
the
head
of
a
sufficient
force
he
determined
to
assault
Preston
without
further
delay
,
when
a
circumstance
occurred
that
induced
him
to
change
his
plan
,
and
begin
with
Lancaster
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
IIThe
Spanish
Man
-
of
-
WarDURING
a
strong
south
-
westerly
gale
,
that
had
prevailed
for
two
or
three
days
,
a
large
Spanish
man
-
of
-
war
,
supposed
to
be
bringing
arms
and
ammunition
for
the
king
's
party
,
was
driven
into
the
estuary
of
the
Wyre
,
and
blown
ashore
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
opposite
Rossall
Hall
.
<EOS>
Being
unable
to
get
away
she
fired
several
guns
for
assistance
,
and
was
quickly
visited
by
a
pilot
,
who
found
she
had
sprung
a
leak
,
and
was
likewise
immovably
embedded
in
the
mud
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
the
pilot
ascertained
that
she
was
furnished
with
twenty
-
one
pieces
of
large
brass
ordnance
,
and
knowing
he
should
be
well
rewarded
for
his
pains
,
he
made
all
haste
to
quit
the
ship
,
and
conveyed
the
intelligence
to
the
commanders
of
the
Parliamentary
garrison
at
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
Cannon
being
greatly
wanted
for
the
defence
of
the
castle
,
Major
Sparrow
immediately
gave
orders
that
two
or
three
strong
boats
should
be
sent
from
Sunderland
,
and
taking
three
companies
of
foot
with
him
,
and
a
number
of
men
armed
with
pole
-
axes
,
he
marched
through
Garstang
,
and
crossing
the
Wyre
at
Saint
Michaels
,
proceeded
with
all
possible
despatch
to
the
stranded
ship
and
took
possession
of
her
in
the
name
of
the
Parliament
.
<EOS>
The
greater
part
of
the
crew
having
already
gone
ashore
,
no
opposition
was
offered
by
Captain
Esteban
Verderol
,
and
Lieutenant
Christobal
Puntales
,
and
Major
Sparrow
and
his
men
immediately
began
to
plunder
the
ship
,
carrying
off
all
they
could
lay
hands
upon
.
<EOS>
All
the
powder
and
small
arms
,
together
with
two
demi
-
cannons
,
a
minion
,
and
three
sakers
had
been
got
into
the
boats
which
had
arrived
from
Sunderland
,
when
the
Parliamentarians
were
disturbed
in
their
operations
by
a
report
that
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
with
a
body
of
four
hundred
horse
,
was
coming
from
Kirkham
to
attack
them
.
<EOS>
Not
caring
to
hazard
an
encounter
with
the
earl
,
Major
Sparrow
immediately
quitted
the
ship
,
and
bidding
the
boatmen
proceed
to
the
further
side
of
Wyre
Water
,
here
almost
as
broad
as
a
lake
,
with
the
plunder
,
he
beat
a
hasty
retreat
with
his
men
.
<EOS>
Only
two
hours
previously
had
Lord
Derby
heard
of
the
stranded
ship
,
and
feeling
certain
the
Parliamentarians
would
plunder
her
and
endeavour
to
secure
her
guns
,
he
determined
to
thwart
the
design
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
set
out
at
once
with
the
force
just
mentioned
,
being
accompanied
in
the
expedition
by
Lord
Molineux
and
Captain
Standish
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
Rossall
,
he
found
several
of
the
crew
,
and
learnt
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
Hoping
to
surprise
the
rebels
,
he
hurried
on
,
but
arrived
too
late
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
had
fled
,
and
he
deemed
pursuit
useless
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
captured
Colonel
George
Dodding
,
and
Mr.
Townson
of
Lancaster
,
who
had
come
thither
to
see
the
ship
,
and
mistook
the
Royalists
for
Parliamentarians
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
and
Lord
Molineux
were
astounded
at
the
size
of
the
ship
,
for
neither
of
them
had
supposed
that
so
large
a
vessel
could
enter
the
mouth
of
the
Wyre
,
and
as
she
stood
there
in
the
shallow
water
her
bulk
seemed
enormous
.
<EOS>
While
noting
her
powerful
ordnance
,
Lord
Derby
determined
to
burn
her
rather
than
any
more
of
her
guns
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
,
and
Lord
Molineux
entirely
approved
of
his
resolution
.
<EOS>
On
going
on
board
with
Lord
Molineux
and
Standish
,
attended
by
a
dozen
men
,
he
was
very
courteously
received
by
Captain
Verderol
,
who
advanced
to
meet
him
,
attended
by
Lieutenant
Puntales
.
<EOS>
Captain
Verderol
had
already
learnt
that
the
new
-
comers
were
Royalists
,
and
being
now
made
aware
that
the
Earl
of
Derby
stood
before
him
,
he
addressed
him
in
French
,
their
subsequent
discourse
being
conducted
in
the
same
language
.
<EOS>
"I
am
proud
to
receive
your
lordship
on
board
my
ship
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
regret
I
can
not
offer
you
a
better
welcome
.
<EOS>
Ten
days
ago
,
I
sailed
from
Dunquerque
,
and
my
instructions
from
his
majesty
King
Philip
the
Fourth
of
Spain
,
were
to
land
certain
arms
and
stores
intended
for
the
use
of
the
Royalist
party
at
some
point
on
this
coast
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
,
I
have
been
unable
to
execute
my
orders
.
<EOS>
Caught
in
a
violent
storm
,
I
was
driven
ashore
,
as
you
see
,
at
the
mouth
of
this
river
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
the
disaster
occurred
,
I
have
been
unable
to
communicate
with
the
loyal
subjects
of
King
Charles
,
and
<EOS>
this
very
day
my
ship
has
been
boarded
and
plundered
by
the
rebels
,
who
have
only
just
departed
,
carrying
off
with
them
all
my
powder
,
and
several
pieces
of
ordnance
.
<EOS>
I
would
your
lordship
had
arrived
a
little
sooner
—
you
might
have
punished
their
audacity
as
it
deserved
.
<EOS>
Their
leader
,
however
,
declared
that
he
would
return
for
the
rest
of
the
cannon
.
<EOS>
""That
shall
never
be
,
captain
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
If
the
rebels
return
they
shall
be
disappointed
.
<EOS>
""You
will
take
the
guns
yourself
,
my
lord
,
"
cried
Verderol
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
—
that
is
impossible
,
captain
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
The
surest
way
to
prevent
the
guns
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
is
to
burn
the
ship
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
deeply
grieved
to
destroy
so
fine
a
vessel
,
but
there
is
no
help
for
it
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
it
must
be
so
<EOS>
,
it
must
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Captain
Verderol
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
say
against
your
determination
.
<EOS>
You
are
quite
justified
in
what
you
propose
to
do
.
<EOS>
""I
am
of
the
same
opinion
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Lieutenant
Puntales
.
<EOS>
"Then
let
all
leave
the
ship
forthwith
<EOS>
,
I
pray
you
,
captain
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"Give
the
necessary
orders
,
lieutenant
,
"
said
Verderol
,
stepping
aside
to
hide
his
emotion
.
<EOS>
"See
<EOS>
that
none
are
left
behind
,
"
remarked
the
earl
to
Standish
,
who
immediately
went
below
.
<EOS>
On
being
made
acquainted
with
Lord
Derby
's
intention
,
such
of
the
crew
as
remained
behind
promptly
departed
,
taking
with
them
what
they
pleased
.
<EOS>
A
couple
of
chests
belonging
to
the
captain
and
lieutenant
were
removed
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
ship
had
been
set
on
fire
in
several
places
below
deck
by
Lord
Derby
's
soldiers
,
and
shortly
afterwards
smoke
began
to
appear
.
<EOS>
Nothing
having
been
seen
of
Frank
Standish
for
some
minutes
,
the
earl
inquired
anxiously
what
had
become
of
him
,
when
the
young
man
suddenly
appeared
on
deck
,
bearing
in
his
arms
a
beautiful
Spanish
damsel
of
some
eighteen
or
nineteen
.
<EOS>
She
had
fainted
,
and
was
closely
followed
by
an
elderly
Spanish
gentleman
—
evidently
her
father
—
and
a
female
attendant
.
<EOS>
IllustrationA
word
of
explanation
may
here
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
Don
Fortunio
Alava
,
a
Spanish
merchant
trading
with
France
,
and
his
daughter
Engracia
,
with
her
attendant
Maria
,
were
being
conveyed
from
Dunquerque
to
Cadiz
,
and
had
suffered
greatly
from
the
disaster
that
had
befallen
the
ship
;
but
they
had
been
still
more
alarmed
by
the
visit
of
the
rebels
,
and
had
taken
refuge
in
the
cabin
,
carefully
barring
the
door
against
intrusion
.
<EOS>
Not
knowing
what
had
taken
place
,
and
imagining
the
rebels
were
still
on
board
,
they
refused
to
come
forth
from
the
cabin
,
and
might
have
been
left
there
to
perish
,
had
not
Frank
Standish
burst
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
Snatching
up
Engracia
,
who
had
fainted
,
as
we
have
said
,
the
young
man
carried
her
on
deck
,
and
was
followed
by
the
others
.
<EOS>
Never
had
he
seen
such
magnificent
black
eyes
as
the
fair
damsel
fixed
upon
him
when
she
regained
her
sensibility
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
thank
him
in
words
,
but
her
looks
sufficiently
expressed
her
gratitude
.
<EOS>
What
she
left
unsaid
,
her
father
supplied
,
and
as
he
spoke
in
French
the
young
man
understood
him
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
Maria
uttered
a
cry
,
and
it
appeared
that
a
valuable
casket
had
been
left
behind
.
<EOS>
Not
a
moment
must
be
lost
if
it
was
to
be
recovered
,
for
the
flames
had
already
burst
forth
,
and
Lord
Derby
reiterated
his
command
that
every
one
should
leave
the
ship
.
<EOS>
Despite
the
injunction
,
Standish
hurried
back
to
the
cabin
,
but
had
not
returned
when
Engracia
with
her
father
and
Maria
were
lowered
into
the
boat
.
<EOS>
Their
uneasiness
,
however
,
was
speedily
dispelled
by
seeing
him
appear
with
the
casket
in
his
hand
,
and
shortly
afterwards
,
on
landing
,
he
had
the
supreme
satisfaction
of
restoring
it
to
its
fair
owner
.
<EOS>
Pleased
by
his
gallantry
,
Lord
Derby
desired
him
to
conduct
Don
Fortunio
and
his
daughter
to
Rossall
Hall
—
an
order
we
may
be
sure
he
very
readily
obeyed
,
and
he
was
delighted
to
find
that
he
could
hold
converse
with
Engracia
,
since
,
like
her
father
,
she
spoke
French
fluently
.
<EOS>
Rossall
Hall
,
which
was
situated
near
the
seashore
,
was
not
very
far
off
,
and
as
the
party
proceeded
slowly
thither
,
they
often
stopped
to
look
back
at
the
burning
ship
,
which
now
being
completely
wrapped
in
flames
,
formed
a
very
striking
spectacle
.
<EOS>
"Holy
<EOS>
Virgin
protect
me
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Engracia
,
"
Little
did
I
think
,
when
I
quitted
Dunquerque
,
that
this
direful
catastrophe
would
occur!—that
our
noble
ship
would
be
driven
ashore
and
burnt
—
and
that
I
should
be
forced
to
land
in
England!""Instead
of
repining
you
ought
to
thank
the
saints
that
you
have
escaped
so
well
,
child
,
"
observed
Don
Fortunio
.
<EOS>
"
But
for
this
brave
young
gentleman
,
who
preserved
us
,
we
should
have
perished
in
the
flames
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
a
dreadful
death!—as
bad
as
an
auto
-
da
-
fe
,
"
exclaimed
Maria
,
in
Spanish
.
<EOS>
"
How
much
we
owe
the
noble
caballero
!
<EOS>
The
señorita
Engracia
must
not
forget
that
he
hazarded
his
life
to
bring
her
the
jewel
-
case
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
forget
it
,
"
said
the
young
damsel
,
fixing
her
dark
eyes
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
overrate
my
services
,
fair
lady
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Standish
,
who
felt
the
glance
vibrate
through
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
what
is
to
become
of
us
in
this
country
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"
It
seems
all
in
a
state
of
rebellion
and
strife
.
<EOS>
""Fear
nothing
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Standish
,
with
a
reassuring
look
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
good
hands
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Derby
will
protect
you
.
<EOS>
""I
have
heard
that
the
Conde
de
Derby
is
the
most
powerful
nobleman
in
this
part
of
the
country
,
and
has
several
castles
,
"
remarked
Don
Fortunio
.
<EOS>
"It
is
quite
true
,
"
replied
Standish
.
"
<EOS>
Lathom
House
,
the
largest
and
strongest
mansion
in
Lancashire
,
belongs
to
him
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
not
many
days
since
the
queen
was
there
.
<EOS>
""Alas
!
<EOS>
poor
lady
!
<EOS>
how
I
pity
her
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
rebels
,
I
fear
,
will
never
rest
till
they
have
driven
her
from
the
kingdom
,
and
dethroned
the
king
her
husband
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
take
a
very
gloomy
view
of
matters
,
fair
lady
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
We
confidently
expect
that
the
rebellion
will
be
speedily
crushed
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
<EOS>
grant
it
may
be
so
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Don
Fortunio
.
<EOS>
"
My
sympathies
are
entirely
with
the
Royalists
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
so
are
mine
,
"
added
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
afraid
when
the
rebels
took
possession
of
the
ship
.
<EOS>
""Cielo
!
<EOS>
how
quickly
she
burns
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Maria
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
will
be
left
of
her
soon
.
<EOS>
"Again
<EOS>
they
halted
to
look
at
the
ill
-
fated
vessel
,
which
was
now
rapidly
being
consumed
,
and
were
so
fascinated
by
the
sight
that
for
a
time
they
could
not
quit
the
spot
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
in
truth
,
a
strange
picture
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
the
crew
,
numbering
three
hundred
,
had
now
assembled
to
look
their
last
on
the
ship
,
and
their
cries
could
be
heard
at
that
distance
.
<EOS>
Behind
them
was
the
troop
of
horse
,
drawn
up
on
the
bank
,
and
watching
the
progress
of
the
conflagration
with
great
interest
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
it
appeared
that
Lord
Derby
had
seen
enough
,
for
his
troop
quitted
their
position
,
and
began
to
move
towards
Rossall
Hall
.
<EOS>
With
him
were
Captain
Verderol
and
Lieutenant
Puntales
,
who
had
been
provided
with
horses
.
<EOS>
Ere
many
minutes
his
lordship
overtook
Standish
,
and
the
party
under
his
charge
,
and
halted
to
speak
to
them
.
<EOS>
Addressing
Don
Fortunio
,
he
said
:
"
You
will
scarce
find
a
refuge
for
your
daughter
in
this
wild
and
disturbed
region
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
propose
that
you
should
take
her
to
my
mansion
,
Lathom
House
,
where
the
countess
will
give
her
welcome
,
and
where
you
can
both
tarry
,
as
long
as
you
think
proper
.
<EOS>
""I
am
greatly
beholden
to
your
lordship
,
"
replied
Don
Fortunio
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
how
am
I
to
get
to
Lathom
House
?
<EOS>
I
am
an
entire
stranger
to
the
country
,
and
,
besides
,
I
have
no
horses
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
not
that
concern
you
,
señor
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
Horses
shall
be
supplied
you
,
and
Captain
Standish
,
with
a
guard
,
shall
accompany
you
to
my
castle
.
<EOS>
""Truly
,
your
lordship
is
a
great
peer
,
and
report
has
not
exaggerated
your
princely
hospitality
,
"
said
Don
Fortunio
,
bowing
deeply
.
<EOS>
Engracia
,
also
,
expressed
her
thanks
—
but
more
by
looks
than
words
.
<EOS>
Standish
could
not
conceal
his
satisfaction
at
an
arrangement
so
entirely
consonant
to
his
wishes
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
then
rode
on
to
Rossall
,
and
the
others
followed
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
hall
,
they
found
that
his
lordship
had
already
given
the
necessary
orders
,
and
a
couple
of
horses
provided
with
pillions
were
quickly
brought
out
.
<EOS>
On
one
of
these
Engracia
was
seated
behind
her
father
,
while
a
stalwart
trooper
took
charge
of
Maria
.
<EOS>
A
guard
of
half
a
dozen
men
was
likewise
in
attendance
.
<EOS>
While
taking
leave
of
Don
Fortunio
and
his
daughter
,
and
wishing
them
a
safe
journey
,
Lord
Derby
expressed
a
hope
that
he
should
find
them
at
Lathom
when
he
returned
thither
.
"Though
<EOS>
when
that
will
be
,
Heaven
only
knows
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
with
a
melancholy
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
much
to
do
,
and
my
enemies
will
not
be
easily
overcome
.
<EOS>
Adieu
!
<EOS>
To
our
next
meeting!""Adieu
!
<EOS>
my
lord
,
"
said
Don
Fortunio
.
<EOS>
"
Never
shall
we
forget
your
kindness!"When
Standish
came
to
receive
the
earl
's
last
commands
,
his
lordship
said
to
him
in
a
low
tone:"To
-
morrow
I
shall
march
to
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
me
there
.
<EOS>
Commend
Don
Fortunio
and
his
daughter
to
the
countess
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
fail
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
trust
to
rejoin
your
lordship
ere
you
reach
Lancaster
.
"He
<EOS>
then
sprang
to
the
saddle
,
and
putting
himself
at
the
head
of
the
little
party
rode
off
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
IIIEngraciaFor
a
mile
<EOS>
or
so
their
course
lay
along
the
banks
of
the
Wyre
Water
—
a
bare
and
desolate
region
.
<EOS>
They
then
struck
off
towards
Poulton
-
in
-
the
-
Fylde
,
and
Standish
seized
the
opportunity
of
joining
the
fair
Spaniard
,
whose
appearance
on
horseback
had
quite
enchanted
him
.
<EOS>
Seated
behind
her
father
,
as
we
have
described
,
she
looked
far
better
than
an
English
damsel
would
have
done
under
similar
circumstances
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
greatly
aided
by
her
costume
.
<EOS>
The
mantilla
covering
her
jetty
tresses
,
the
dark
silk
dress
that
so
well
displayed
her
symmetrical
figure
and
permitted
her
small
feet
to
be
seen
,
and
the
fan
she
managed
so
well
—
all
contributed
materially
to
her
attractions
,
and
certainly
produced
an
effect
upon
Standish
.
<EOS>
For
some
little
time
he
rode
by
her
side
,
and
during
that
interval
,
he
unaccountably
slackened
his
pace
.
<EOS>
As
Don
Fortunio
rarely
made
a
remark
,
or
looked
back
at
them
,
they
might
almost
have
been
alone
.
<EOS>
What
they
talked
about
it
is
scarcely
worth
while
to
inquire
,
but
both
seemed
interested
,
and
the
fair
señorita
's
dark
eyes
were
occasionally
cast
down
and
her
fan
agitated
.
<EOS>
Maria
,
who
watched
them
from
her
post
behind
the
trooper
,
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
had
fallen
in
love
with
each
other
,
and
she
was
not
far
wrong
.
<EOS>
While
passing
through
Poulton
,
almost
all
the
inhabitants
of
which
were
Romanists
and
Royalists
,
many
of
the
villagers
came
forth
to
gaze
at
the
foreigners
,
and
seemed
wonder
-
struck
by
Engracia
's
picturesque
attire
and
extraordinary
beauty
.
<EOS>
A
like
sensation
was
produced
at
Great
Singleton
,
Wharles
,
and
Treales
.
<EOS>
At
the
latter
place
,
the
good
folks
were
informed
by
a
Romish
priest
that
the
Spaniards
belonged
to
their
own
religion
,
and
,
in
consequence
,
Don
Fortunio
was
treated
with
great
respect
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
they
had
met
with
no
interruption
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
they
overtook
a
party
of
billmen
or
clubmen
,
but
all
these
stout
fellows
were
going
to
join
the
Royalist
force
at
Kirkham
,
and
on
beholding
Standish
and
his
troop
,
they
shouted
"
God
bless
the
king
and
the
Earl
of
Derby!"At
Tulketh
Hall
,
near
Ashton
—
originally
a
monastic
establishment
—
the
owner
of
which
was
a
Papist
,
a
brief
halt
was
made
,
and
the
Spaniards
were
very
hospitably
received
.
<EOS>
But
Engracia
was
best
pleased
by
being
taken
to
the
domestic
chapel
by
the
priest
,
who
resided
in
the
house
,
and
enabled
to
offer
up
her
prayers
to
the
Virgin
.
<EOS>
From
Tulketh
Hall
,
half
a
dozen
armed
men
accompanied
the
party
to
the
ford
across
the
Ribble
—
some
apprehensions
being
entertained
that
a
guard
had
been
placed
there
by
the
rebel
garrison
at
Preston
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
report
proved
unfounded
,
and
they
got
safe
to
Penwortham
.
<EOS>
Frank
Standish
had
now
no
misgivings
,
and
would
willingly
have
loitered
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
But
this
could
not
be
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
he
was
obliged
to
push
on
,
in
order
to
make
up
for
lost
time
.
<EOS>
At
the
bridge
across
the
Douglas
near
Tarleton
,
he
perceived
three
or
four
Roundhead
soldiers
,
and
prepared
to
attack
them
,
but
they
galloped
off
before
he
came
up
.
<EOS>
He
subsequently
learnt
that
they
had
plundered
several
farm
-
houses
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
were
carrying
their
spoil
to
Blackburn
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
only
danger
to
which
they
were
exposed
.
<EOS>
Thenceforward
,
so
much
expedition
was
used
that
in
half
an
hour
's
time
the
party
came
in
sight
of
a
large
castellated
mansion
,
surrounded
by
a
wide
moat
,
having
a
great
gatehouse
,
turreted
walls
bristling
with
cannon
,
and
a
lofty
square
tower
in
the
centre
,
above
which
floated
a
banner
,
bearing
the
motto
—
SANS
CHANGER
.
<EOS>
Everything
indicated
that
the
place
was
a
powerful
stronghold
.
<EOS>
No
remark
was
made
by
Standish
,
but
Don
Fortunio
and
his
daughter
simultaneously
exclaimed:"That
must
be
Lathom
House
.
<EOS>
""You
are
right
,
"
replied
the
young
man
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
Lathom
.
<EOS>
What
think
you
of
it?""It
is
worthy
of
the
Conde
de
Derby
,
"
said
Don
Fortunio
.
<EOS>
"It
does
not
appear
strange
to
me
,
"
remarked
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
I
have
seen
it
before
.
<EOS>
""Impossible
,
my
child
,
"
said
Don
Fortunio
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
no
castle
like
this
in
Spain
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
must
have
dreamed
of
it
,
"
rejoined
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
IVHow
Don
Fortunio
and
his
Daughter
were
received
by
the
Countess
of
DerbyAs
Standish
and
his
troop
were
recognised
by
the
guard
,
the
gate
was
thrown
open
for
their
admittance
,
and
the
party
rode
in
without
delay
.
<EOS>
The
strangers
caused
as
much
sensation
as
they
had
done
at
different
places
during
the
journey
.
<EOS>
Officers
and
men
turned
out
to
gaze
at
the
beautiful
Spanish
damsel
.
<EOS>
As
yet
no
news
had
been
received
of
the
destruction
of
the
Dunquerque
ship
<EOS>
,
so
they
could
not
comprehend
whence
she
came
,
but
they
saw
she
was
a
lovely
creature
,
and
were
glad
she
had
found
her
way
to
Lathom
.
<EOS>
Amongst
the
first
to
notice
her
was
Gertrude
Rosworm
,
who
might
have
been
as
favourably
impressed
as
the
others
,
if
Standish
had
appeared
less
attentive
,
while
assisting
the
fair
Spaniard
.
<EOS>
From
that
moment
an
instinctive
feeling
of
jealousy
,
for
which
she
could
scarcely
account
,
was
awakened
in
Gertrude
's
bosom
.
<EOS>
As
to
Engracia
herself
,
she
was
lost
in
admiration
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
It
chanced
that
at
the
time
of
the
arrival
of
the
strangers
,
the
Countess
of
Derby
was
in
the
upper
part
of
the
court
-
yard
with
her
daughters
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
inspecting
some
soldiers
,
and
was
just
about
to
return
to
the
house
,
when
the
Lady
Mary
drew
her
attention
to
the
singularity
of
Engracia
's
costume
,
and
she
at
once
exclaimed:"That
must
be
a
Spanish
maiden
.
<EOS>
"Next
<EOS>
moment
,
Captain
Standish
came
up
,
and
hastily
explained
all
that
had
occurred
,
concluding
with
Lord
Derby
's
message
to
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
did
she
hear
it
than
she
desired
that
Don
Fortunio
and
his
daughter
might
be
presented
to
her
,
and
received
them
with
great
affability
and
kindness
,
saying
,
that
as
they
had
been
so
warmly
commended
to
her
by
her
lord
,
they
were
heartily
welcome
to
Lathom
.
<EOS>
Don
Fortunio
was
much
struck
by
her
stately
presence
and
dignified
manner
,
but
Engracia
felt
a
certain
awe
of
the
great
lady
.
<EOS>
However
,
she
was
charmed
with
the
young
ladies
Stanley
,
and
felt
quite
easy
with
them
.
<EOS>
They
were
equally
well
pleased
with
her
,
and
thought
her
the
loveliest
creature
they
ever
beheld
.
<EOS>
After
a
brief
conversation
with
the
strangers
,
which
it
is
scarcely
needful
to
say
was
conducted
in
French
,
the
countess
led
them
into
the
house
,
where
,
she
again
bade
them
welcome
,
and
signing
to
Trioche
,
who
was
standing
among
the
other
servants
in
the
hall
,
directed
him
to
conduct
Don
Fortunio
to
a
chamber
which
she
designated
in
the
great
gallery
.
<EOS>
Her
next
thought
was
for
Engracia
,
and
being
aware
that
Gertrude
Rosworm
spoke
French
,
she
begged
her
to
take
charge
of
the
fair
Spanish
damsel
and
her
attendant
,
and
find
them
a
suitable
bed
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
This
was
soon
done
,
and
Gertrude
was
about
to
leave
them
in
the
room
she
had
chosen
,
when
Engracia
besought
her
to
remain
.
<EOS>
"Do
stay
with
me
a
few
minutes
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
are
very
amiable
,
and
will
not
refuse
to
give
me
some
information
respecting
the
castle
and
its
inmates
.
<EOS>
""Excuse
me
,
señorita
,
"
replied
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
forbidden
to
talk
on
such
subjects
.
<EOS>
Lathom
House
is
a
garrison
.
<EOS>
""Yes
<EOS>
,
I
quite
understand
,
"
said
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
curiosity
to
learn
how
many
soldiers
it
contains
—
how
many
cannon
—
or
the
amount
of
its
stores
.
<EOS>
I
merely
seek
a
little
information
on
one
or
two
points
.
<EOS>
First
of
all
I
will
venture
to
inquire
whether
there
is
a
priest
in
the
castle
?
<EOS>
I
am
accustomed
to
have
a
confessor
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
countess
has
two
domestic
chaplains
—
Doctor
Rutter
and
Doctor
Brideoake
,
both
worthy
and
excellent
men
—
and
service
is
performed
twice
a
day
in
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
But
these
are
Protestant
clergymen
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
I
supposed
,
"
sighed
Engracia
.
<EOS>
And
she
added
in
Spanish
to
her
attendant
,
"
You
must
do
without
a
priest
,
Maria
.
<EOS>
There
is
none
here
.
<EOS>
"Maria
<EOS>
uttered
an
ejaculation
of
despair
.
<EOS>
"There
may
be
a
priest
for
aught
I
know
,
"
remarked
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"
If
so
,
you
will
soon
hear
of
him
.
<EOS>
Two
of
the
officers
and
several
of
the
men
are
Papists
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
the
caballero
who
brought
us
here
is
not
a
heretic
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"Captain
<EOS>
Standish
is
a
Protestant
,
"
rejoined
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"Ay
de
mi
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
devout
Spanish
damsel
,
clasping
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"What
matters
his
faith
to
you
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Gertrude
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"Nothing
,
"
replied
Engracia
.
<EOS>
But
her
looks
contradicted
her
words
.
<EOS>
"If
you
would
stand
well
with
the
countess
do
not
talk
to
her
on
matters
of
religion
,
"
said
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
tolerant
.
<EOS>
With
this
piece
of
advice
I
leave
you
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
she
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
"I
do
not
like
that
damsel
,
"
observed
Engracia
to
her
attendant
,
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
do
I
think
she
likes
me
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
señorita
is
right
,
"
replied
Maria
.
<EOS>
"
The
maiden
's
eyes
had
a
jealous
sparkle
in
them
.
<EOS>
Do
not
trust
her
.
<EOS>
She
regards
you
as
a
rival
.
<EOS>
""As
a
rival
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
sure
as
I
was
born
in
Cordova
,
she
is
in
love
with
the
handsome
caballero
,
"
pursued
Maria
.
<EOS>
"It
may
be
so
,
"
said
Engracia
,
colouring
deeply
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
señorita
need
not
trouble
herself
about
that
,
"
cried
Maria
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
preferred
,
I
am
certain
.
<EOS>
I
saw
enough
during
the
journey
to
convince
me
the
caballero
is
desperately
enamoured
of
her
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
he
is
a
heretic
,
Maria
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
señorita
will
convert
him
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
difficulty
is
great
—
<EOS>
but
perhaps
it
may
be
got
over
,
"
said
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
doubt
of
it
,
"
replied
Maria
.
<EOS>
"De
<EOS>
paso
,
what
have
you
done
with
the
casket
,
Maria
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
not
lost
it?""Lost
it
!
<EOS>
Saints
forbid
!
<EOS>
It
is
here
,
"
cried
Maria
,
producing
it
.
<EOS>
Engracia
was
gladdening
her
eyes
with
a
sight
of
its
glittering
contents
,
when
a
tap
was
heard
at
the
door
,
and
some
girlish
voices
called
out
in
French
,
"
May
we
come
in?"Conjecturing
who
were
her
visitors
,
Engracia
opened
the
door
herself
,
and
beheld
the
young
ladies
Stanley
,
who
had
brought
her
some
articles
of
attire
,
thinking
she
might
need
them
.
<EOS>
"I
am
sure
my
dresses
will
fit
you
,
"
cried
Lady
Henriette
Marie
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
about
the
same
height
.
<EOS>
""You
are
a
little
taller
,
but
they
will
fit
me
perfectly
,
"
replied
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"They
will
become
the
señorita
maravillosamente
,
"
cried
Maria
,
as
she
took
the
dresses
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
can
I
thank
you
for
this
great
attention
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"We
want
no
thanks
—
we
want
no
thanks
,
"
cried
all
three
girls
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
pleasure
to
us
to
serve
you
.
<EOS>
"Suddenly
<EOS>
Lady
Kate
caught
sight
of
the
casket
,
and
exclaimed:"Heavens
,
what
beautiful
jewels!""Where
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
little
Lady
Amelia
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
them
.
<EOS>
""There
—
on
the
table
,
"
replied
Lady
Kate
.
<EOS>
And
they
all
rushed
forward
to
look
at
them
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
nothing
was
heard
but
rap
-
turous
exclamations
.
<EOS>
Charmed
by
this
display
,
Engracia
in
the
most
obliging
manner
begged
each
of
them
to
select
an
ornament
.
<EOS>
"Oh
!
<EOS>
no
—
no
—
no
!
<EOS>
"
they
all
cried
,
drawing
back
.
<EOS>
"You
will
deprive
me
of
a
great
pleasure
if
you
refuse
,
"
said
the
good-
natured
Spanish
maiden
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
we
ca
n't
possibly
accept
such
magnificent
presents
,
"
replied
the
Lady
Henriette
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
you
deign
to
accept
a
single
pearl
each
?
"
said
Engracia
.
<EOS>
The
two
younger
girls
consulted
their
elder
sister
by
a
look
.
<EOS>
While
they
hesitated
,
Engracia
took
three
pearls
from
a
string
,
and
gave
one
to
each
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
would
willingly
do
more
,
if
you
would
allow
me
,
"
she
said
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"You
have
done
far
too
much
already
,
"
rejoined
Lady
Henriette
.
<EOS>
"
These
are
lovely
pearls
.
<EOS>
We
must
show
them
to
the
countess
,
our
mother
,
and
if
she
will
allow
us
,
we
will
gladly
accept
them
.
<EOS>
"They
then
retired
,
but
the
little
Lady
Amelia
would
not
quit
the
room
till
she
had
kissed
her
new
friend
.
<EOS>
Contrary
to
expectation
,
the
countess
did
not
object
to
the
gifts
.
<EOS>
Like
her
daughters
she
was
charmed
by
the
winning
and
ingenuous
manner
of
the
fair
Spaniard
,
and
would
not
mortify
her
by
a
refusal
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VLove
and
JealousyTHE
<EOS>
countess
had
been
questioning
Standish
as
to
her
lord
's
plans
,
and
though
she
naturally
felt
some
anxiety
as
to
the
result
of
the
meditated
attack
on
Lancaster
,
she
allowed
no
doubt
to
appear
in
her
looks
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
Lancaster
falls
,
Preston
will
soon
follow
,
"
she
said
;
"
and
then
my
lord
will
once
more
be
master
of
that
part
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
Of
late
,
the
rebels
have
been
gaining
ground
,
but
a
defeat
like
this
will
be
a
great
check
to
them
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
his
lordship
felt
compelled
to
burn
that
Spanish
ship
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
step
was
unavoidable
,
madam
,
"
replied
Standish
.
"
<EOS>
Had
the
rebels
succeeded
in
securing
the
guns
,
Lancaster
might
have
held
out
for
a
month
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
what
has
become
of
the
unfortunate
captain
and
his
crew
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
captain
and
lieutenant
are
with
his
lordship
,
"
replied
Standish
.
"
<EOS>
As
to
the
crew
they
will
doubtless
join
our
ranks
.
<EOS>
""When
<EOS>
do
you
return
?
<EOS>
"
she
demanded
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
till
to
-
morrow
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Horses
and
men
will
then
be
fresh
.
<EOS>
I
shall
set
out
at
day
-
break
,
and
hope
to
rejoin
his
lordship
near
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
""It
is
well
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
take
a
letter
from
me
to
him
.
<EOS>
"Just
<EOS>
then
,
her
daughters
entered
the
hall
,
and
showed
her
the
presents
they
had
received
from
the
fair
Spaniard
.
<EOS>
"She
is
as
generous
as
a
princess
,
"
observed
the
countess
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
hope
she
will
remain
with
us
a
long
time
,
"
said
Amelia
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
shall
love
her
very
much
.
<EOS>
""Yes
,
we
all
like
her
,
"
said
Lady
Kate
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
not
wonder
at
it
,
"
remarked
the
countess
.
"
<EOS>
But
she
may
not
wish
to
remain
here
.
<EOS>
""I
think
she
does
,
"
said
Lady
Henriette
.
<EOS>
The
hour
had
now
arrived
at
which
the
countess
attended
evening
service
in
the
chapel
,
and
she
therefore
proceeded
thither
with
her
daughters
.
<EOS>
She
was
followed
by
Standish
and
several
of
the
household
,
and
Gertrude
soon
afterwards
joined
the
little
train
.
<EOS>
The
chapel
was
situated
in
the
inner
court
,
and
was
capable
of
containing
a
great
number
of
persons
.
<EOS>
A
large
pew
on
the
left
near
the
altar
was
occupied
by
the
countess
and
her
daughters
.
<EOS>
Gertrude
sat
with
them
.
<EOS>
The
body
of
the
chapel
near
the
door
was
crowded
with
musketeers
,
in
front
of
whom
were
Captains
Standish
,
Chisenhale
,
Ogle
,
and
Molineux
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
The
service
was
admirably
performed
by
Doctor
Rutter
.
<EOS>
When
the
congregation
came
forth
,
Standish
repaired
to
the
stables
to
give
some
orders
to
his
men
,
and
was
returning
through
the
inner
court
,
when
he
perceived
Gertrude
at
a
distance
and
tried
to
overtake
her
,
but
she
hurried
on
,
and
avoided
him
.
<EOS>
According
to
custom
supper
was
served
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
great
banquet-
hall
.
<EOS>
Among
the
company
were
Don
Fortunio
and
his
daughter
,
with
all
the
officers
of
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
Don
Fortunio
sat
on
the
right
of
the
countess
,
and
Standish
contrived
to
obtain
a
place
near
Engracia
.
<EOS>
Gertrude
was
likewise
present
,
but
she
sat
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
,
and
never
looked
towards
them
.
<EOS>
Both
chaplains
supped
regularly
with
the
countess
,
and
grace
was
never
omitted
before
and
after
the
meal
.
<EOS>
Great
form
was
observed
on
the
occasion
;
the
servants
were
marshalled
by
a
steward
carrying
a
wand
,
and
Trioche
devoted
himself
exclusively
to
the
Spaniards
.
<EOS>
But
the
meal
,
though
ceremonious
,
was
of
short
duration
.
<EOS>
When
grace
had
been
said
by
Doctor
Brideoake
,
the
countess
arose
,
and
all
the
company
followed
her
example
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
the
party
remained
in
the
hall
,
conversing
together
.
<EOS>
After
pacing
to
and
fro
for
a
few
minutes
,
Standish
and
Engracia
sat
down
on
a
couch
at
the
further
end
of
the
vast
apartment
,
which
was
here
but
imperfectly
illumined
.
<EOS>
They
had
much
to
say
to
each
other
,
but
now
they
were
alone
,
and
might
have
said
it
,
they
remained
mute
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
are
you
so
pensive
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Engracia
,
at
length
.
<EOS>
"I
am
thinking
how
wretched
I
shall
be
to
-
morrow
,
when
I
am
forced
to
ride
away
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
For
the
first
time
the
battle
-
call
will
fail
to
animate
me
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
should
not
feel
so
sad
,
if
you
would
give
me
some
hopes
that
the
passion
you
have
inspired
is
requited
.
<EOS>
"Owing
<EOS>
to
the
obscurity
,
Engracia
's
blushes
could
not
be
seen
,
and
besides
she
had
her
fan
.
<EOS>
She
murmured
some
response
,
but
it
was
scarcely
audible
.
<EOS>
Standish
took
her
hand
,
and
as
she
did
not
withdraw
it
,
he
conveyed
it
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"You
have
wrought
a
great
change
in
me
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Heretofore
,
I
enjoyed
nothing
so
much
as
an
expedition
like
that
in
which
I
am
about
to
be
engaged
,
but
now
I
would
rather
stay
here
.
<EOS>
""That
must
not
be
,
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Go
and
fight
by
the
side
of
your
valiant
lord
,
and
win
renown
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
certain
I
shall
think
of
you
constantly
during
your
absence
,
and
rejoice
at
your
return
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
find
you
here
when
I
come
back
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"Undoubtedly
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
probability
of
our
immediate
departure
.
<EOS>
The
countess
,
as
you
know
,
has
seconded
her
lord
's
invitation
,
and
urged
us
to
stay
as
long
as
we
like
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
noble
dame
.
<EOS>
I
am
delighted
with
her
and
her
daughters
,
and
feel
I
shall
be
happy
here
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
I
feared
this
dull
life
would
not
suit
you
.
<EOS>
There
are
no
diversions
here
—
no
fêtes
.
<EOS>
One
day
is
like
another
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
want
amusement
.
<EOS>
I
shall
think
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
perfectly
content
if
there
had
been
a
priest
.
<EOS>
""That
is
a
difficulty
I
can
not
get
over
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
would
recommend
you
to
perform
your
devotions
in
private
—
since
by
doing
so
,
you
can
offend
none
.
<EOS>
""Such
<EOS>
is
my
design
,
"
said
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"
I
spoke
to
the
damsel
who
conducted
me
to
my
chamber
,
and
she
gave
me
like
advice
.
<EOS>
""Gertrude
?
"
remarked
Standish
.
<EOS>
"Yes
<EOS>
,
that
is
her
name
.
<EOS>
She
is
very
beautiful
,
and
I
can
not
but
admire
her
,
but
I
do
not
think
I
can
ever
love
her
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
hope
you
may
not
dislike
her
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
I
fear
she
dislikes
you
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
should
she
dislike
me
?
<EOS>
What
have
I
done
to
offend
her?""Nothing
,
"
replied
a
voice
near
them
,
which
both
recognised
as
Gertrude
's
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
my
own
name
mentioned
,
"
continued
the
speaker
,
"
and
I
deem
it
right
to
say
I
have
no
feeling
towards
<EOS>
you
save
good
will
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
to
receive
the
assurance
,
"
said
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
not
confide
in
her
,
"
whispered
Standish
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
fear
I
have
intruded
,
but
<EOS>
I
have
no
such
design
,
"
said
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
Then
addressing
Standish
,
she
added
,
"
The
countess
desires
to
speak
with
you
.
<EOS>
She
is
in
the
presence
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
""I
will
attend
upon
her
ladyship
at
once
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
And
bowing
,
he
left
the
two
damsels
together
.
<EOS>
Proceeding
to
the
presence
-
chamber
,
he
found
the
countess
.
<EOS>
She
gave
him
a
letter
,
and
charged
him
with
several
verbal
messages
to
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"Say
<EOS>
everything
loving
from
me
to
my
lord
,
"
she
observed
,
"
and
all
that
is
fond
and
dutiful
from
my
children
to
their
father
.
<EOS>
I
have
but
one
other
injunction
to
give
you
.
<EOS>
Be
first
to
bring
me
tidings
of
the
defeat
of
the
rebels
.
<EOS>
""If
life
be
left
me
,
and
my
lord
will
grant
me
leave
<EOS>
,
I
will
do
it
,
"
replied
Standish
,
as
he
placed
the
letter
carefully
in
his
doublet
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
set
out
early
in
the
morn?""At
daybreak
.
<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
well
.
<EOS>
A
soldier
should
be
early
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
to
wish
you
a
good
journey
,
and
a
safe
return
.
<EOS>
Au
revoir
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
other
opportunity
occurred
to
the
young
man
of
exchanging
a
word
with
Engracia
,
beyond
bidding
her
adieu
at
parting
for
the
night
,
but
the
tender
valedictory
look
<EOS>
she
gave
him
<EOS>
was
sufficient
.
<EOS>
He
looked
round
in
vain
for
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
She
had
retired
.
<EOS>
The
bell
struck
five
as
Standish
entered
the
court
-
yard
next
morning
,
and
found
his
little
troop
waiting
for
him
,
fully
armed
and
equipped
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
just
light
,
and
the
musketeers
were
scarcely
distinguishable
on
the
walls
,
but
while
glancing
round
,
he
perceived
a
female
figure
near
the
entrance
of
the
hall
,
and
feeling
sure
it
must
be
Gertrude
,
he
left
his
horse
with
a
trooper
,
and
hastened
towards
her
.
<EOS>
Before
he
could
reach
the
spot
,
the
figure
had
disappeared
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
VIHow
<EOS>
the
Mayor
of
Lancaster
was
summoned
by
the
Earl
of
Derby
to
surrender
the
TowerNo
adventure
of
any
kind
<EOS>
occurred
to
Standish
and
his
troop
till
they
came
within
a
few
miles
of
Preston
,
when
learning
that
the
bridge
over
the
Ribble
was
strongly
guarded
,
they
turned
off
on
the
right
,
and
crossing
the
river
near
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
,
proceeded
to
Ribbleton
,
and
thence
to
Fulwood
and
Broughton
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
this
district
was
overrun
by
foraging
parties
from
Preston
,
and
being
anxious
to
avoid
an
engagement
,
Standish
sought
to
keep
out
of
their
way
;
but
as
he
drew
near
Myerscough
Hall
—
the
residence
of
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
,
who
was
then
with
Lord
Derby
—
he
encountered
a
small
troop
of
Parliamentarians
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
plundering
some
farmhouses
belonging
to
Sir
Thomas
,
and
were
hastening
to
Preston
with
their
spoil
.
<EOS>
Standish
at
once
attacked
them
,
and
a
sharp
conflict
ensued
,
but
it
was
soon
ended
.
<EOS>
Shouts
were
heard
in
the
direction
of
Myerscough
announcing
pursuit
,
whereupon
the
Roundheads
threw
down
their
booty
and
galloped
off
.
<EOS>
Immediately
afterwards
a
dozen
stalwart
yeomen
,
mounted
on
strong
horses
,
and
armed
with
muskets
and
pistols
,
made
their
appearance
,
and
were
well
satisfied
to
regain
their
goods
without
continuing
the
pursuit
.
<EOS>
They
heartily
thanked
Standish
for
the
aid
he
had
rendered
them
,
and
only
wished
they
had
come
up
in
time
to
punish
the
robbers
.
<EOS>
From
these
men
Standish
learned
that
the
Earl
of
Derby
had
arrived
overnight
at
Garstang
with
the
whole
of
his
force
,
and
was
probably
there
still
.
<EOS>
But
for
this
piece
of
information
,
a
halt
would
have
been
made
at
Myerscough
,
but
the
young
man
now
pushed
on
,
and
in
half
an
hour
reached
Garstang
,
where
he
found
Lord
Derby
,
who
was
very
glad
to
see
him
,
and
receive
the
letter
from
the
countess
.
<EOS>
Before
eight
o'clock
,
the
whole
Royalist
force
,
now
exceeding
three
thousand
men
—
horse
and
foot
—
set
forward
towards
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
The
men
were
in
good
spirits
,
and
enjoyed
the
march
.
<EOS>
Mists
still
hung
upon
Bleasdale
Moors
,
and
the
Fell
Ends
overhanging
Lower
Wyersdale
,
but
the
estuary
of
the
River
Lune
and
the
broad
expanse
of
Morecambe
Bay
glittered
in
the
sunbeams
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
the
stern
old
keep
of
Lancaster
Castle
came
in
sight
,
and
on
beholding
it
,
the
billmen
and
clubmen
shook
their
weapons
and
shouted
lustily
.
<EOS>
From
their
numbers
the
Royalists
presented
a
very
imposing
appearance
.
<EOS>
The
advanced
guard
,
consisting
of
three
troops
of
horse
,
was
commanded
by
Lord
Molineux
.
<EOS>
Then
came
Lord
Derby
at
the
head
of
a
large
body
of
horse
,
very
well
mounted
and
equipped
.
<EOS>
These
were
followed
by
several
companies
of
musketeers
,
led
by
Sir
John
Girlington
and
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
.
<EOS>
Then
came
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
with
a
regiment
of
horse
,
while
the
billmen
and
clubmen
,
divided
into
fifteen
companies
,
each
numbering
a
hundred
,
and
each
having
a
captain
,
brought
up
the
rear
.
<EOS>
These
formidable
fellows
were
content
to
serve
without
reward
,
but
expected
to
pay
themselves
with
plunder
.
<EOS>
Embodied
with
them
were
the
crew
of
the
Spanish
ship
,
armed
with
pikes
,
and
commanded
by
Captain
Verderol
and
Lieutenant
Puntales
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
Moorside
,
within
a
mile
of
Lancaster
,
a
halt
was
called
,
and
Lord
Derby
,
attended
by
Standish
,
rode
to
the
front
to
reconnoitre
the
town
,
and
confer
with
Lord
Molineux
and
the
other
commanders
.
<EOS>
Lancaster
Castle
,
as
already
explained
,
was
fortified
and
garrisoned
by
a
strong
Parliamentary
force
,
commanded
by
Colonel
Holcroft
,
Major
Sparrow
,
and
Major
Heywood
,
and
could
only
be
taken
by
a
regular
siege
,
but
Lord
Derby
intended
to
storm
the
town
,
and
deal
with
the
castle
afterwards
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
was
much
surprised
,
however
,
to
find
that
,
after
all
,
the
guns
had
been
recovered
from
the
charred
remains
of
the
Spanish
ship
,
and
transported
to
the
castle
walls
,
where
they
now
threatened
him
,
but
though
vexed
,
he
could
not
help
admiring
the
spirit
displayed
by
Major
Sparrow
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
the
force
of
the
garrison
,
two
regiments
had
been
formed
by
the
townsfolk
,
each
three
hundred
strong
,
and
respectively
commanded
by
Captains
Ashworth
and
Shuttleworth
.
<EOS>
Until
the
arrival
of
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
the
Parliamentary
commanders
were
very
well
satisfied
with
their
preparations
,
but
when
they
beheld
the
large
Royalist
force
drawn
up
in
the
plain
below
,
they
began
to
feel
uneasy
,
and
messengers
were
despatched
to
Sir
John
Seaton
at
Preston
,
urging
him
to
send
them
aid
.
<EOS>
Having
carefully
examined
the
defences
of
the
castle
,
and
pointed
out
the
Spanish
guns
on
the
walls
to
Lord
Molineux
and
the
others
,
Lord
Derby
read
to
them
a
summons
,
which
he
proposed
to
send
to
the
mayor
and
burgesses
before
commencing
an
attack
on
the
town
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
ran:"I
have
come
to
free
you
from
the
bondage
of
the
declared
traitors
,
who
now
oppress
you
,
and
seek
your
destruction
by
bringing
you
into
their
own
condition
.
<EOS>
Deliver
up
your
arms
,
and
lend
me
aid
to
regain
the
castle
,
and
you
shall
have
all
fair
usage
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
expect
from
me
what
the
laws
of
the
land
and
of
war
will
inflict
upon
you
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
missive
,
being
entirely
approved
by
the
other
commanders
,
Lord
Derby
delivered
it
to
Captain
Standish
,
who
immediately
rode
off
towards
the
town
,
attended
by
a
trumpeter
carrying
a
flag
of
truce
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
the
entrance
of
the
town
,
Standish
found
a
small
troop
of
horse
drawn
up
under
the
command
of
Captain
Shuttleworth
,
who
rode
forward
to
meet
him
,
and
learning
that
he
brought
a
summons
for
the
mayor
from
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
said:"If
you
will
tarry
but
a
short
space
<EOS>
,
I
promise
you
shall
take
back
an
answer
—
but
to
obtain
it
you
must
accompany
me
to
the
castle
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
answer
<EOS>
I
require
is
from
the
mayor
and
burgesses
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
The
commanders
of
the
garrison
are
not
summoned
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
well
knows
they
would
not
surrender
the
castle
.
<EOS>
The
town
is
different
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
mayor
and
the
town
council
are
now
in
the
castle
with
Colonel
Holcroft
,
"
replied
Captain
Shuttleworth
.
<EOS>
"
They
will
consult
together
when
the
summons
is
laid
before
them
.
<EOS>
""On
that
understanding
I
consent
to
accompany
you
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
Thereupon
,
they
proceeded
to
the
castle
,
followed
by
the
guard
.
<EOS>
At
that
time
Lancaster
Castle
was
surrounded
by
a
moat
,
and
had
been
strongly
fortified
by
the
Parliamentarian
commanders
.
<EOS>
The
walls
were
thronged
with
musketeers
,
and
amongst
its
ordnance
could
be
discerned
the
pieces
of
cannon
taken
from
the
Spanish
ship
.
<EOS>
While
Captain
Shuttleworth
passed
through
the
gateway
to
deliver
the
summons
to
the
commanders
of
the
garrison
and
the
mayor
,
Standish
remained
outside
,
near
the
drawbridge
,
and
employed
the
interval
in
surveying
the
magnificent
prospect
spread
out
before
him
.
<EOS>
His
eye
was
still
wandering
over
the
estuary
of
the
Lune
,
Morecambe
Bay
,
and
the
fine
Westmoreland
hills
,
when
Captain
Shuttleworth
came
forth
,
and
giving
him
a
letter
,
said:"This
is
the
answer
to
Lord
Derby
's
summons
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
its
purport
.
<EOS>
The
mayor
and
burgesses
affirm
that
the
castle
never
was
at
their
command
,
and
having
been
taken
and
fortified
by
the
Parliament
,
the
Parliament
now
holds
the
town
in
control
.
<EOS>
Thus
much
on
their
part
.
<EOS>
But
even
if
the
town
were
independent
of
the
castle
,
they
,
the
mayor
and
burgesses
,
would
never
consent
to
a
surrender
.
<EOS>
""They
understand
the
consequences
of
a
refusal
,
I
presume
?
"
<EOS>
observed
Standish
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
They
must
expect
the
full
punishment
of
war
.
<EOS>
""They
will
adhere
to
the
Parliament
,
and
resist
to
the
uttermost
,
"
replied
Shuttleworth
.
<EOS>
Standish
said
no
more
.
<EOS>
Accompanied
by
his
conductor
to
the
end
of
the
avenue
leading
to
the
town
,
he
took
a
courteous
leave
of
him
,
and
rode
back
to
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
On
perusing
the
answer
brought
him
the
earl
was
highly
incensed
,
and
exclaiming
that
the
rebels
and
traitors
would
bitterly
rue
their
decision
,
gave
immediate
orders
for
the
assault
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIIHow
Lancaster
was
taken
by
the
EarlIN
a
very
short
space
of
time
,
the
whole
Royalist
force
,
divided
into
four
squadrons
—
each
numbering
four
hundred
men
—
was
moving
towards
the
town
,
but
in
different
directions
,
as
the
attack
was
intended
to
be
made
at
various
points
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
,
there
were
the
billmen
and
club
-
men
,
who
were
likewise
divided
into
four
companies
,
each
having
a
mounted
leader
.
<EOS>
The
squadron
commanded
by
Lord
Molineux
started
first
,
having
a
wide
circuit
to
make
,
and
kept
as
much
as
possible
under
the
cover
of
the
hedges
,
but
it
was
descried
from
the
castle
,
and
formed
a
mark
for
the
guns
,
which
now
began
to
play
upon
the
besiegers
.
<EOS>
Moving
off
with
his
men
towards
the
river
,
Sir
John
Girlington
attacked
the
town
on
the
north
.
<EOS>
An
intermediate
point
was
chosen
by
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
,
while
Lord
Derby
marched
along
the
high
road
on
the
south
side
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
Not
only
was
he
exposed
to
the
fire
of
the
castle
guns
,
but
his
advance
was
disputed
by
Captain
Shuttleworth
and
a
large
body
of
cavalry
.
<EOS>
Seeing
that
a
charge
was
about
to
be
made
,
the
earl
halted
,
and
firmly
received
the
furious
onset
.
<EOS>
He
then
attacked
the
rebels
in
his
turn
,
and
drove
them
back
into
the
town
,
killing
a
great
number
,
and
pursuing
them
so
quickly
that
they
could
not
make
another
stand
.
<EOS>
In
vain
Captain
Shuttleworth
endeavoured
to
rally
his
men
.
<EOS>
They
would
not
stop
till
they
reached
the
castle
,
and
being
hotly
pursued
by
Standish
and
a
party
of
horsemen
better
mounted
than
the
rest
,
Shuttleworth
was
cut
down
before
he
could
cross
the
drawbridge
.
<EOS>
This
daring
act
had
well
-
nigh
cost
Standish
his
life
.
<EOS>
A
shower
of
bullets
flew
around
him
,
and
it
seemed
miraculous
that
he
was
not
hit
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
managed
to
rejoin
Lord
Derby
safe
and
sound
,
and
found
him
engaged
in
setting
fire
to
several
houses
in
the
main
thoroughfare
,
in
order
to
clear
them
of
the
marksmen
,
who
did
great
mischief
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
rattle
of
musketry
was
heard
in
other
quarters
,
commingled
with
the
roar
of
the
castle
guns
.
<EOS>
But
the
latter
did
more
harm
to
friends
than
foes
,
and
many
buildings
were
crushed
by
the
ponderous
shot
.
<EOS>
Strange
to
say
both
Captain
Verderol
and
Lieutenant
Puntales
,
who
were
with
Lord
Derby
,
were
killed
by
the
discharge
of
a
cannon
taken
from
their
own
ship
.
<EOS>
Their
death
infuriated
the
crew
to
such
a
degree
,
that
they
butchered
many
unresisting
townspeople
,
and
vowed
vengeance
upon
Major
Sparrow
.
<EOS>
They
kept
their
oath
in
this
manner
.
<EOS>
Three
of
them
,
armed
with
muskets
they
had
picked
up
,
contrived
to
reach
the
bank
of
the
moat
unobserved
,
and
perceiving
Major
Sparrow
on
the
walls
,
whom
they
recognised
from
having
seen
him
when
he
plundered
the
ship
,
they
took
deliberate
aim
,
and
shot
him
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
town
was
completely
invested
by
the
Royalists
,
who
gained
an
entrance
at
every
point
they
attacked
,
and
driving
their
opponents
before
them
made
their
way
to
the
market
-
place
,
where
they
formed
a
junction
.
<EOS>
In
accomplishing
this
object
they
sustained
comparatively
little
loss
,
but
the
destruction
they
caused
was
terrible
.
<EOS>
The
Parliamentary
troops
who
opposed
them
were
forced
to
retreat
,
while
the
townspeople
,
many
of
whom
were
favourably
disposed
towards
the
besiegers
,
were
ruthlessly
slaughtered
,
since
no
quarter
was
given
.
<EOS>
Buildings
were
set
on
fire
in
every
direction
,
and
two
whole
streets
were
burnt
down
,
but
not
before
the
houses
had
been
pillaged
by
the
billmen
and
clubmen
,
who
claimed
the
right
to
plunder
.
<EOS>
For
more
than
three
hours
the
Royalists
were
scattered
in
various
parts
of
the
town
,
and
as
they
could
not
be
restrained
by
their
leaders
,
the
havoc
was
frightful
.
<EOS>
Such
were
the
horrors
of
Civil
War
,
like
excesses
being
committed
by
both
sides
.
<EOS>
During
all
this
time
,
the
guns
of
the
castle
continued
firing
,
but
as
we
have
already
explained
they
did
infinitely
more
damage
to
the
townspeople
than
to
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
strife
ceased
,
at
least
in
the
central
part
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
Quarter
,
hitherto
refused
,
was
now
given
in
every
instance
,
to
those
who
submitted
.
<EOS>
Houses
were
still
burning
in
various
parts
,
and
pillage
was
still
going
on
,
but
the
firing
from
the
castle
had
ceased
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
there
was
good
reason
for
the
cessation
,
for
the
supply
of
powder
was
well
-
nigh
exhausted
.
<EOS>
This
circumstance
would
have
rendered
Colonel
Holcroft
seriously
uneasy
,
if
he
had
not
felt
sure
of
aid
from
Preston
.
<EOS>
No
intelligence
had
been
received
from
Sir
John
Seaton
,
but
it
could
not
be
doubted
that
when
that
brave
commander
heard
of
Lord
Derby
's
attack
upon
Lancaster
,
he
would
hasten
to
the
assistance
of
the
town
and
garrison
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
was
quite
aware
of
the
difficulties
in
which
the
garrison
was
placed
.
<EOS>
He
knew
they
not
only
wanted
powder
and
match
,
but
provisions
,
since
several
hundreds
of
the
townspeople
had
taken
refuge
in
the
castle
,
and
must
be
fed
.
<EOS>
He
also
knew
that
the
well
would
soon
be
drained
,
and
the
want
of
water
and
food
must
compel
a
speedy
surrender
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
determined
to
press
the
siege
with
the
utmost
vigour
,
and
was
detailing
his
plans
at
a
council
of
war
held
in
the
town
-
hall
,
when
a
sudden
change
was
caused
by
important
intelligence
brought
him
by
his
scouts
from
Preston
.
<EOS>
That
very
night
it
appeared
Sir
John
Seaton
was
about
to
march
from
Preston
with
fifteen
hundred
musketeers
and
some
troops
of
horse
to
the
relief
of
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
Lord
Molineux
,
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
,
and
the
other
commanders
and
captains
who
assisted
at
the
council
,
looked
aghast
,
but
Lord
Derby
seemed
quite
undismayed
.
"Since
<EOS>
Sir
John
Seaton
is
coming
to
Lancaster
,
we
must
go
to
Preston
,
"
he
said
;
"
but
by
a
different
route
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
,
he
will
march
through
Garstang
.
<EOS>
Our
route
must
,
therefore
,
be
by
Cockerham
,
Kirkland
,
and
Catterall
.
<EOS>
We
will
set
forth
at
dusk
with
our
whole
force
.
<EOS>
""It
will
be
dark
in
an
hour
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
.
<EOS>
"
The
men
are
scattered
about
the
town
,
and
can
not
be
got
together
in
that
time
.
<EOS>
""They
<EOS>
must
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
Preston
must
be
attacked
to
-
night
,
and
before
dawn
it
will
be
in
our
hands
.
<EOS>
""A
<EOS>
bold
stroke
,
and
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
it
will
prove
successful
,
"
observed
Lord
Molineux
.
<EOS>
"Deprived
<EOS>
of
all
its
strength
,
the
town
can
offer
no
resistance
,
and
must
surrender
,
"
said

"Ay
,
the
Royalists
will
not
be
afraid
to
declare
themselves
,
"
said
Lord
Molineux
.
<EOS>
"They
will
welcome
us
as
deliverers

"
said
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton

<EOS>
"
Sir
John
Seaton
could
not
have
served
us
better
than
by
this
movement

<EOS>
""'Twill
be
a
good
exchange
,
"
said
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
"
Preston
is
of
more
importance
to
the
king
than
Lancaster
;
and
having
recovered
it
,
we
will
summon
Blackburn
.
<EOS>
""Nothing
would
please
me
better
than
to
punish
that
insolent
town

said
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton

<EOS>
"Ere
<EOS>
many
days
you
shall
have
the
satisfaction
you
desire
,
Sir
Gilbert

"
rejoined
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
first
,
we
must
secure
Preston
.
<EOS>
Let
the
men
be
got
together
forthwith

<EOS>
But
mark
!
<EOS>
no
trumpets
must
be
sounded
;
or
our
purpose
will
be
suspected
,
and
information
sent
to
the
enemy

<EOS>
""Tidings
of
Seaton
's
design
can
not
yet
have
reached
the
garrison

"
remarked
Lord
Molineux
.
<EOS>
"I
will
not
answer
for
it
,
"
replied
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
Colonel
Holcroft
finds
we
have
quitted
the
town

he
will
infallibly
pursue
us
,
and
endeavour
to
impede
our
march

<EOS>
""We
ought
not
then
to
set
out
till
it
is
quite
dark
,
"
observed
Sir
John
Girlington
.
<EOS>
"We
must
quit
the
town
by
different
outlets
,
"
said
the
earl
;
"
and
our
rendezvous
must
be
Ashton

on

the
Lune

<EOS>
Now
to
collect

"CHAPTER
<EOS>
VIIIHow
Preston
surrendered
to
the
Earl
of
DerbyBY
dint
of
great
exertion
on
the
part
of
the
commanders
and
officers
,
the
men
belonging
to
each
corps
were
got
together
at
the
appointed
time
,
and
marched
secretly
out
of
the
town
,
as
Lord
Derby
had
directed
.
<EOS>
The
chief
difficulty
was
with
the
billmen
and
clubmen
,
who
were
very
reluctant
to
abandon
their
spoil
,
but
being
told
that
they
would
certainly
be
cut
to
pieces
if
found
there
by
Sir
John
Seaton
,
they
contented
themselves
with
what
they
could
carry
off
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
was
the
first
to
arrive
at
the
place
of
rendezvous
,
but
the
others
were
not
long
behind
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
dark
,
but
from
this
point
the
town
presented
a
terrible
spectacle
.
<EOS>
Many
houses
were
still
burning
in
various
quarters
,
and
a
lurid
light
was
thrown
on
the
walls
and
keep
of
the
castle
.
<EOS>
Dreadful
as
was
the
scene
,
it
produced
little
effect
upon
the
beholders
,
most
of
whom
rejoiced
to
think
that
Sir
John
Seaton
would
find
the
town
untenable
on
his
arrival
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
force
was
complete
,
the
order
to
march
was
given
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
commanded
the
advanced
guard
,
and
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
brought
up
the
rear
.
<EOS>
The
road
to
Cockerham
was
taken
,
and
as
they
were
now
close
to
the
bay
,
and
the
tide
out
,
the
broad
sands
could
be
distinguished
through
the
gloom
.
<EOS>
Nothing
occurred
till
they
reached
Cockerham
Moss
,
and
as
they
skirted
it
,
the
sound
of
horse
was
heard
behind
,
and
they
knew
they
were
pursued
.
<EOS>
On
this
alarm
,
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
halted
,
and
immediately
wheeling
round
,
awaited
the
horsemen
,
whom
he
did
not
doubt
came
from
the
castle
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
's
departure
had
not
been
accomplished
with
so
much
secrecy
as
to
escape
the
notice
of
the
garrison
,
and
Colonel
Holland
finding
that
the
whole
of
the
Royalists
had
evacuated
the
town
,
and
probably
set
out
for
Preston
,
started
in
pursuit
with
a
large
party
of
horse
,
determined
to
harass
them
.
<EOS>
Easily
ascertaining
the
route
they
had
taken
,
he
hovered
for
some
time
in
their
rear
,
and
then
made
a
sudden
dash
forward
,
but
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
being
prepared
,
drove
him
back
with
the
loss
of
several
men
,
and
the
colonel
did
not
hazard
another
attack
.
<EOS>
Thenceforward
,
the
march
of
the
Royalists
continued
without
interruption
.
<EOS>
From
Nateby
,
Frank
Standish
,
ever
ready
for
a
daring
exploit
,
rode
across
the
country
with
a
couple
of
well
-
mounted
troopers
and
brought
word
back
that
Sir
John
Seaton
with
his
whole
force
had
halted
at
Garstang
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
Lord
Derby
's
intention
,
as
we
have
shown
,
to
surprise
Preston
that
night
,
but
as
he
proceeded
,
he
learned
from
his
scouts
that
the
Royalists
had
begun
to
display
a
bold
front
against
the
few
Parliamentarians
in
the
town
,
so
that
he
should
be
able
to
take
possession
of
it
almost
without
a
blow
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
postponed
the
attack
till
the
morrow
,
and
halted
for
the
night
at
Fulwood
Moor
,
on
the
north
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
,
however
,
soon
learnt
that
he
was
in
the
neighbourhood
with
a
large
force
,
and
the
tidings
being
quickly
spread
about
—
notwithstanding
the
lateness
of
the
hour
—
<EOS>
caused
the
greatest
delight
to
the
Royalists
,
and
corresponding
dismay
among
the
rebels
.
<EOS>
It
chanced
that
there
were
several
Roundheads
from
Blackburn
and
Bolton
lodging
at
the
inns
that
night
,
who
sought
to
decamp
,
but
were
unable
to
do
so
,
since
the
ostlers
,
who
sympathised
with
the
Royalists
,
locked
the
doors
of
the
stables
,
and
took
away
the
keys
,
to
prevent
the
intending
fugitives
from
getting
out
their
horses
.
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
at
an
early
hour
,
Lord
Derby
marched
up
to
the
Friar
's
Gate
.
<EOS>
The
avenue
was
strongly
guarded
,
but
not
a
single
shot
was
fired
,
and
as
the
earl
drew
near
with
his
whole
force
,
the
rebels
fled
.
<EOS>
The
bars
were
then
broken
down
,
and
the
gate
burst
open
by
the
clubmen
,
whereupon
several
troops
of
horse
dashed
in
,
and
galloping
right
and
left
,
posted
themselves
at
Church
Gate
and
Fisher
Gate
to
prevent
flight
,
while
another
party
scoured
the
Ribble
Bridge
and
the
adjacent
ferry
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
earl
had
entered
the
town
with
his
commanders
,
and
after
ordering
several
arrests
to
be
made
,
and
a
great
number
of
houses
to
be
taken
possession
of
,
but
not
plundered
,
he
proceeded
along
Friar's
-
street
at
the
head
of
a
regiment
of
horse
.
<EOS>
Crowds
of
loyal
folk
came
forth
to
greet
him
—
hailing
him
as
their
deliverer
.
<EOS>
All
the
Parliamentarians
seemed
to
have
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Scarves
and
kerchiefs
were
waved
from
the
windows
,
hats
flung
in
the
air
,
and
enthusiastic
shouts
were
everywhere
heard
of
"
God
bless
the
king
and
the
Earl
of
Derby!"Thus
<EOS>
triumphantly
did
the
earl
ride
to
the
market
-
place
,
where
a
large
concourse
was
assembled
.
<EOS>
Before
alighting
at
the
town
-
hall
,
he
called
to
Standish
who
was
close
behind
him
,
and
said:"Take
half
a
dozen
men
with
you
,
and
make
all
haste
you
can
to
Lathom
.
<EOS>
Tell
the
countess
I
have
recovered
Preston
for
the
king
,
without
a
shot
fired
or
a
life
lost
.
<EOS>
The
news
will
gladden
her
.
"Standish
<EOS>
instantly
set
forth
on
the
joyful
errand
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
first
to
quit
the
town
,
and
cross
the
Ribble
,
since
gate
and
bridge
had
been
guarded
by
the
Royalists
.
<EOS>
As
he
looked
back
from
the
riverside
,
he
saw
the
royal
standard
floating
above
the
church
tower
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
's
orders
were
strictly
carried
out
.
<EOS>
Anxious
to
avoid
a
repetition
of
the
terrible
scenes
that
had
occurred
at
Lancaster
,
he
would
not
allow
any
slaughter
.
<EOS>
Several
hundred
prisoners
were
made
,
and
being
deprived
of
their
arms
,
were
shut
up
in
the
church
or
in
the
gaol
.
<EOS>
Finding
it
impossible
to
check
the
clubmen
,
Lord
Derby
allowed
them
to
plunder
a
certain
number
of
houses
and
shops
,
and
then
dismissed
them
.
<EOS>
Heavy
fines
were
imposed
on
several
of
the
wealthier
rebels
,
and
were
ordered
to
be
paid
at
the
town
-
hall
on
the
following
day
,
and
the
amount
was
then
distributed
among
the
soldiers
.
<EOS>
When
Preston
was
stormed
by
Sir
John
Seaton
,
Adam
Morte
,
the
loyal
mayor
,
was
slain
while
fighting
valiantly
against
the
besiegers
.
<EOS>
His
grave
was
in
the
churchyard
,
and
all
the
prisoners
taken
to
the
church
were
compelled
by
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
to
walk
past
it
bareheaded
.
<EOS>
Not
deeming
this
indignity
enough
,
the
guard
would
willingly
have
forced
them
to
kneel
down
at
the
grave
,
while
some
of
the
townspeople
,
who
revered
the
memory
of
the
heroic
mayor
,
went
still
further
,
and
would
have
shot
a
score
of
rebels
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
losing
Adam
Morte
,
we
lost
the
best
and
bravest
man
in
Preston
,
"
remarked
a
bystander
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
was
a
staunch
Cavalier
,
and
detested
a
Roundhead
as
much
as
he
loved
the
king
.
<EOS>
He
vowed
he
would
never
surrender
Preston
with
life
,
and
if
the
besiegers
entered
,
it
should
be
over
his
dead
body
.
<EOS>
The
first
three
Parliamentarians
who
mounted
the
walls
fell
by
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
could
have
escaped
with
his
men
,
but
he
would
not
fly
.
<EOS>
He
fought
obstinately
to
the
last
—
wounding
a
rebel
with
every
blow
.
<EOS>
Mad
with
rage
against
him
,
they
thrust
him
through
with
their
pikes
,
and
flung
his
bleeding
body
from
the
walls
.
<EOS>
And
here
the
brave
man
lies
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
not
bedew
his
grave
with
their
blood?"Had
<EOS>
the
guard
received
a
look
from
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
they
would
have
complied
,
but
he
sternly
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
"Adam
Morte
fell
in
fair
fight
,
"
remarked
one
of
the
prisoners
—
a
dark-
looking
Puritan
.
<EOS>
"Thou
<EOS>
art
one
of
those
who
helped
to
slay
him
,
Phineas
Clay
,
"
cried
the
first
speaker
.
<EOS>
"I
deny
it
not
,
"
rejoined
Clay
.
<EOS>
"
I
glory
in
the
deed
.
<EOS>
I
did
good
service
in
removing
so
bitter
a
malignant
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
the
words
were
uttered
,
a
bullet
was
lodged
in
the
Puritan
's
brain
,
and
he
fell
upon
Adam
Morte
's
grave
.
<EOS>
No
one
knew
by
whom
the
shot
had
been
fired
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
care
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
and
Lord
Molineux
took
up
their
quarters
in
the
town
-
hall
.
<EOS>
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
owned
a
large
mansion
in
the
town
,
which
had
been
occupied
by
Sir
John
Seaton
,
while
he
was
in
command
of
Preston
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
Sir
Gilbert
took
immediate
possession
of
his
own
house
,
and
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
and
Sir
John
Girlington
were
lodged
with
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
difficulty
in
providing
the
soldiers
with
quarters
.
<EOS>
Plenty
of
ammunition
was
found
in
the
magazine
,
and
on
the
walls
,
which
had
recently
been
strengthened
by
Seaton
,
were
a
few
small
pieces
of
ordnance
.
<EOS>
This
was
highly
satisfactory
to
Lord
Derby
,
since
it
was
quite
possible
he
might
soon
be
besieged
in
his
turn
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
IXHow
Frank
Standish
brought
news
of
the
Surrender
of
PrestonABOUT
noon
on
the
same
day
on
which
Lord
Derby
regained
Preston
,
the
countess
ascended
the
Eagle
Tower
at
Lathom
House
,
in
company
with
her
daughters
,
Gertrude
Rosworm
,
and
Doctor
Rutter
.
<EOS>
She
conversed
with
none
of
them
,
and
her
countenance
wore
a
thoughtful
,
almost
sad
expression
.
<EOS>
Early
that
morning
a
messenger
had
brought
word
that
Lancaster
had
fallen
;
adding
that
half
the
town
was
burnt
and
many
of
the
inhabitants
slain
.
<EOS>
The
latter
part
of
the
intelligence
distressed
her
exceedingly
,
and
she
could
not
shake
off
the
painful
impression
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
ladyship
looks
pensive
,
"
observed
Doctor
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"I
am
thinking
of
Lancaster
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Much
mischief
must
necessarily
be
done
when
a
town
is
stormed
,
and
if
the
soldiers
only
suffered
I
should
not
much
heed
,
but
I
can
not
help
grieving
for
the
inhabitants
who
have
been
forced
by
the
garrison
to
resist
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
my
lord
would
willingly
have
spared
them
,
<EOS>
had
it
been
possible
.
<EOS>
""Rebellion
must
be
punished
with
severity
,
madam
,
or
it
can
never
be
effectually
crushed
,
"
replied
the
chaplain
;
"
and
though
no
doubt
many
innocent
persons
perished
with
the
guilty
in
this
terrible
siege
,
the
earl
could
not
distinguish
between
them
.
<EOS>
The
blame
must
rest
with
those
evil
-
minded
persons
who
compelled
their
fellow
-
townsmen
to
defy
the
king
's
authority
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
to
be
hoped
that
the
fate
of
Lancaster
will
prove
a
warning
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
warning
,
I
fear
,
will
be
disregarded
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
The
rebels
will
retaliate
.
<EOS>
The
castle
is
still
occupied
by
the
garrison
,
and
will
cost
a
long
siege
ere
it
can
be
taken
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
my
opinion
,
madam
,
the
garrison
will
surrender
,
"
rejoined
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"
The
capture
of
the
town
is
a
great
blow
.
<EOS>
We
shall
soon
hear
more
good
news
.
<EOS>
""It
comes
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Gertrude
,
who
had
been
anxiously
looking
out
for
another
messenger
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
a
small
party
of
horsemen
galloping
hither
.
<EOS>
"All
<EOS>
eyes
were
instantly
turned
in
the
direction
towards
which
she
pointed
.
<EOS>
"You
must
be
mistaken
,
girl
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
perceive
no
horsemen
.
<EOS>
""You
will
behold
them
presently
,
madam
,
"
replied
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
hidden
by
the
trees
.
<EOS>
"Almost
<EOS>
as
she
spoke
,
the
troop
appeared
,
and
the
Lady
Henriette
Marie
called
out:"Yes
,
there
they
are
!
<EOS>
The
Cavalier
at
their
head
is
Captain
Standish
.
""Standish
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
countess
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
of
a
surety
,
he
brings
good
tidings
.
<EOS>
""Was
<EOS>
I
not
right
<EOS>
,
madam
?
"
said
Doctor
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
not
the
castle
has
been
taken
.
<EOS>
""Surrendered
—
not
taken
,
"
rejoined
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
heartily
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
"Just
<EOS>
then
the
leader
of
the
little
troop
,
which
was
approaching
very
rapidly
,
descried
the
party
on
the
Eagle
Tower
,
and
waved
his
feathered
hat
to
them
.
<EOS>
The
action
caused
great
excitement
among
the
beholders
,
and
the
young
ladies
Stanley
,
as
well
as
Gertrude
,
waved
their
kerchiefs
in
reply
.
<EOS>
"May
<EOS>
we
go
down
and
meet
him
,
dearest
mother
?
"
said
the
Lady
Henriette
Marie
.
<EOS>
Beseeching
looks
were
cast
by
all
the
others
at
the
countess
,
who
willingly
assented
,
and
the
whole
party
descended
to
the
court
-
yard
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
they
got
there
,
Standish
and
his
followers
had
nearly
reached
the
mansion
,
and
a
loud
shout
from
the
warders
at
the
gate
,
and
musketeers
on
the
walls
,
greeted
them
,
as
they
crossed
the
drawbridge
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
the
countess
and
those
with
her
in
the
court
,
Standish
hastily
alighted
and
hurrying
towards
her
would
have
flung
himself
at
her
feet
if
she
had
not
stopped
him
.
<EOS>
"Your
news
—
your
news
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
lord
has
recovered
Preston
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
last
heard
of
him
,
he
was
at
Lancaster
,
and
about
to
besiege
the
castle
.
<EOS>
""His
<EOS>
lordship
left
Lancaster
last
night
,
madam
,
and
this
morning
,
he
surprised
Preston
.
<EOS>
He
is
now
master
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
""A
<EOS>
great
achievement
,
and
quickly
performed
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
redound
to
his
lordship
's
honour
.
"
<EOS>
She
then
asked
in
an
anxious
tone
,
"
Has
there
been
much
slaughter?""None
<EOS>
whatever
,
madam
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
bade
<EOS>
me
tell
you
that
not
a
man
has
been
killed
.
<EOS>
""I
am
truly
glad
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
This
clemency
may
be
set
against
the
havoc
at
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
""His
<EOS>
lordship
would
gladly
have
spared
the
people
of
Lancaster
,
madam
;
but
they
refused
his
summons
,
being
compelled
to
do
so
by
the
commanders
of
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
""Had
<EOS>
the
garrison
been
put
to
the
sword
I
should
not
have
grieved
,
"
said
the
countess
;
"
but
I
pity
those
poor
souls
.
<EOS>
""They
<EOS>
do
not
all
deserve
your
pity
,
madam
—
nor
can
they
complain
,
<EOS>
since
,
as
I
have
shown
,
they
brought
this
punishment
upon
themselves
.
<EOS>
"Here
Doctor
Rutter
interposed
.
<EOS>
"Shall
<EOS>
we
proceed
to
the
chapel
,
madam
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
offer
up
thanks
to
Heaven
for
the
victory
vouchsafed
us
,
and
for
the
preservation
of
the
earl
from
his
<EOS>
enemies?""I
was
about
to
make
the
suggestion
,
reverend
sir
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
Our
first
duty
is
to
Heaven
,
and
if
we
neglect
it
,
we
can
not
hope
that
our
cause
will
continue
to
prosper
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
this
time
,
all
the
officers
of
the
garrison
had
come
up
,
and
manifested
the
greatest
satisfaction
,
when
they
learnt
that
Preston
had
been

CHAPTER
<EOS>
XHow
Hoghton
Tower
was
blown
upCOLONEL
NICHOLAS
STARKIE
,
of
Huntroyd
,
a
staunch
Parliamentary
leader
,
who
had
previously
defeated
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
at
Hintfield
Moor
,
having
learnt
that
Sir
Gilbert
had
marched
with
Lord
Derby
on
Lancaster
,
resolved
to
surprise
Hoghton
Tower
,
and
suddenly
appeared
before
it
with
three
hundred
men
,
and
some
cannon
,
and
firing
a
shot
against
the
gates
summoned
the
commander
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
Captain
Musgrave
,
who
had
been
left
in
charge
of
the
castle
by
Sir
Gilbert
,
and
had
with
him
forty
musketeers
,
haughtily
refused
the
summons
,
and
at
once
returned
the
fire
.
<EOS>
The
defence
was
vigorous
,
but
it
soon
became
clear
that
the
assault
would
be
successful
,
whereupon
Captain
Musgrave
sent
out
an
officer
to
demand
a
parley
,
which
was
granted
.
<EOS>
A
conference
then
took
place
between
Musgrave
and
Colonel
Starkie
—
the
result
of
which
was
that
the
former
offered
to
deliver
up
the
castle
,
provided
the
lives
of
the
garrison
were
spared
.
<EOS>
These
terms
being
agreed
to
,
after
the
delay
of
half
an
hour
,
Colonel
Starkie
and
his
men
entered
the
outer
court
,
where
they
found
Captain
Musgrave
with
the
musketeers
drawn
up
,
and
ready
to
depart
.
<EOS>
The
great
gates
of
the
inner
court
were
likewise
thrown
open
,
and
no
one
could
be
seen
upon
the
towers
or
walls
.
<EOS>
"You
have
done
wisely
in
delivering
up
the
castle
to
us
,
Captain
Musgrave
,
since
you
can
not
hold
it
,
"
said
Colonel
Starkie
,
as
he
courteously
saluted
the
discomfited
officer
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
made
a
gallant
defence
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
hope
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
may
think
so
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Musgrave
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
Are
we
free
to
depart?"Receiving
an
answer
in
the
affirmative
,
he
passed
with
the
musketeers
through
the
outer
gate
,
and
quickly
descending
the
hill
,
made
the
best
of
his
way
with
the
little
party
to
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
,
whence
they
proceeded
to
Preston
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Colonel
Starkie
entered
the
castle
with
his
men
,
and
mounted
towards
the
upper
part
of
the
building
,
in
quest
of
arms
and
ammunition
.
<EOS>
In
a
chamber
on
the
summit
of
the
structure
,
they
found
a
much
larger
supply
of
muskets
,
calivers
,
petronels
,
and
pistols
than
they
expected
,
besides
a
great
number
of
old
arquebuses
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
there
were
two
or
three
barrels
of
gunpowder
,
one
of
which
seemed
to
have
been
half
emptied
by
the
men
previous
to
their
departure
,
since
a
good
deal
of
powder
was
scattered
about
on
the
floor
,
and
on
the
staircase
.
<EOS>
Attaching
little
importance
to
this
circumstance
,
Colonel
Starkie
was
collecting
all
the
arms
he
could
find
,
when
a
terrific
explosion
took
place
,
that
shook
the
whole
fabric
to
its
foundations
,
rent
the
walls
,
blew
off
a
large
portion
of
the
roof
,
and
scattered
great
beams
,
stones
,
and
mutilated
bodies
far
and
wide
.
<EOS>
Immediately
following
the
explosion
,
shrieks
and
cries
could
be
heard
,
forming
altogether
a
most
appalling
and
unearthly
noise
.
<EOS>
When
the
soldiers
left
in
the
court
-
yard
recovered
from
the
shock
,
they
rushed
into
the
house
,
and
found
nothing
but
a
heap
of
ruins
,
amidst
which
could
be
seen
the
bodies
of
their
dead
or
dying
comrades
.
<EOS>
The
upper
part
of
the
staircase
was
entirely
destroyed
,
the
floor
cracked
and
broken
,
and
a
great
portion
of
the
roof
blown
off
.
<EOS>
It
was
speedily
discovered
that
a
train
had
been
laid
,
which
had
set
fire
to
the
barrels
of
gunpowder
.
<EOS>
By
this
stratagem
Colonel
Starkie
with
a
hundred
and
fifty
of
his
soldiers
were
destroyed
.
<EOS>
Starkie
's
body
was
so
mutilated
that
it
was
only
by
his
accoutrements
that
he
could
be
recognised
.
<EOS>
The
train
had
been
laid
by
Urmston
,
the
steward
.
<EOS>
He
was
betrayed
by
some
of
the
household
,
and
shot
.
<EOS>
The
central
part
-
of
the
edifice
,
where
the
explosion
occurred
,
was
so
damaged
that
it
could
not
be
inhabited
,
and
it
was
not
thought
worth
while
to
repair
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
castle
was
fortified
as
strongly
as
ever
,
and
the
three
large
pieces
of
ordnance
still
kept
their
places
on
the
outer
gate
.
<EOS>
By
the
Royalists
the
act
was
looked
upon
as
just
vengeance
—
by
the
Roundheads
it
was
regarded
as
a
detestable
piece
of
treachery
,
which
Heaven
in
due
time
would
infallibly
punish
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
XIHow
Lord
Goring
brought
a
Despatch
from
the
King
to
the
Earl
of
DerbyTwo
days
after
he
had
captured
Preston
,
Lord
Derby
held
a
council
of
war
in
an
inner
room
in
the
town
-
hall
,
at
which
Lord
Molineux
,
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
,
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
and
all
the
other
commanders
were
present
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
now
a
proposition
to
make
to
you
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
This
success
must
be
immediately
followed
up
.
<EOS>
Before
the
rebels
can
recover
from
their
surprise
we
must
strike
another
and
heavier
blow
.
<EOS>
We
must
attack
Manchester
with
the
fixed
determination
of
taking
the
town
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
we
shall
be
successful
.
<EOS>
This
very
night
we
must
start
on
the
enterprise
.
<EOS>
If
we
tarry
here
we
shall
have
to
defend
ourselves
against
Sir
John
Seaton
and
Colonel
Holcroft
,
who
most
assuredly
will
besiege
the
town
,
whereas
if
we
set
out
at
once
our
movements
can
not
be
checked
.
<EOS>
""I
entirely
agree
with
your
lordship
that
it
will
be
best
to
leave
Preston
,
"
said
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
thought
it
was
your
intention
to
take
Blackburn
,
and
then
proceed
to
Bolton
.
<EOS>
""Manchester
is
far
more
important
than
either
Blackburn
or
Bolton
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
And
if
I
march
against
the
town
now
,
I
will
either
take
the
place
,
or
lay
my
bones
there
.
<EOS>
Are
you
of
my
mind
,
gentlemen
?
<EOS>
Will
you
all
go
with
me?""After
our
former
experience
,
"
remarked
Lord
Molineux
,
"
I
think
the
attempt
on
Manchester
<EOS>
very
hazardous—""The
town
must
be
captured
—
sooner
or
later
,
"
said
Lord
Derby
,
"
or
the
whole
county
is
lost
to
the
king
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
Colonel
Holland
and
Colonel
Assheton
are
unprepared
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
I
will
raise
no
further
objections
,
"
said
Lord
Molineux
.
<EOS>
"I
will
go
wherever
your
lordship
chooses
to
lead
me
,
"
said
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
I
,
"
added
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
,
and
several
others
.
<EOS>
"Then
we
will
set
out
to
-
night
with
all
our
force
,
"
said
the
earl
,
"
and
proceed
to
Chorley
.
<EOS>
Tomorrow
we
will
move
on
to
Wigan
,
and
give
out
that
we
mean
to
assault
Bolton
,
but
ere
another
dawn
shall
break
the
rebels
shall
find
us
at
Manchester
.
<EOS>
"Preparations
were
then
secretly
made
by
the
Royalists
for
their
departure
,
and
at
nightfall
,
Lord
Derby
,
with
his
whole
force
,
marched
to
Chorley
,
where
they
took
up
their
quarters
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
hours
'
repose
,
the
army
pursued
its
march
to
Wigan
without
meeting
any
opposition
.
<EOS>
This
town
still
remained
faithful
to
Lord
Derby
,
and
here
he
had
placed
a
strong
garrison
under
the
command
of
Major
Blair
,
and
had
recently
fortified
it
with
new
gates
and
outworks
,
so
that
the
town
was
in
an
excellent
state
of
defence
,
and
the
commander
laughed
at
the
threats
of
the
rebels
.
<EOS>
But
scarcely
had
Lord
Derby
entered
Wigan
than
all
his
plans
were
frustrated
.
<EOS>
Lord
Goring
,
with
a
small
guard
,
had
just
arrived
from
Oxford
,
bearing
a
despatch
from
his
majesty
.
<EOS>
The
earl
received
him
in
the
presence
of
Lord
Molineux
and
all
the
other
commanders
.
<EOS>
"You
are
welcome
,
my
lord
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
trust
you
bring
good
news
from
his
majesty?""Not
such
good
news
as
I
could
desire
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Goring
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
king
has
instant
need
of
aid
,
and
enjoins
your
lordship
,
on
your
allegiance
,
to
send
him
forthwith
all
the
men
you
can
spare
.
<EOS>
The
despatch
I
have
just
given
you
is
an
order
to
that
effect
,
as
you
will
find
.
<EOS>
Lord
Molineux
is
also
commanded
to
rejoin
his
majesty
with
all
his
officers
and
men
.
<EOS>
""I
am
quite
ready
to
obey
the
order
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Lord
Molineux
;
"
though
I
must
mention
that
I
have
engaged
with
Lord
Derby
to
make
another
assault
on
Manchester
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
earl
was
unable
to
conceal
his
chagrin
,
though
he
controlled
himself
as
well
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
"I
am
ready
as
ever
to
obey
his
majesty
's
behest
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
will
bring
him
all
the
troops
I
can
muster
—
horse
and
foot
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
pray
for
three
or
four
days
'
delay
,
during
which
I
shall
endeavour
to
take
Manchester
;
and
the
importance
of
that
capture
will
,
I
trust
,
satisfy
his
majesty
.
<EOS>
""There
must
be
no
delay
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Lord
Goring
,
haughtily
.
<EOS>
"
You
make
sure
of
taking
Manchester
,
but
you
were
not
successful
on
a
former
occasion
.
<EOS>
As
I
have
already
told
you
,
his
majesty
requires
at
once
all
the
force
he
can
muster
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
lord
,
I
believe
if
I
had
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
his
majesty
,
he
would
approve
of
my
purpose—""Then
you
refuse
to
obey
?
"
said
Lord
Goring
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"No
,
my
lord
,
<EOS>
but
I
must
strongly
remonstrate
,
"
said
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
opportunity
will
be
lost
that
may
never
occur
again
.
<EOS>
""I
am
bound
to
say
,
"
remarked
Lord
Molineux
,
"
that
,
in
my
opinion
,
Manchester
is
so
strongly
garrisoned
,
and
so
well
defended
,
that
it
can
not
be
taken
under
a
month
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
hear
,
my
lord
?
"
said
Goring
,
looking
at
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
say
you
,
Sir
Thomas
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
to
Tyldesley
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
had
experience
of
this
rebel
town
.
<EOS>
""My
experience
leads
me
to
the
same
conclusion
as
Lord
Molineux
,
"
replied
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"
Manchester
can
not
be
taken
by
a
coup
de
main
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Holland
and
Colonel
Assheton
are
too
much
on
the
alert
.
<EOS>
""You
are
both
mistaken
,
"
cried
the
earl
,
warmly
.
"
<EOS>
Let
us
march
there
to
-
day
<EOS>
and
I
will
engage
to
take
the
town
before
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
If
your
lordship
will
come
with
me
,
you
shall
behold
the
royal
banner
floating
from
the
church
tower
at
dawn
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
comply
with
your
request
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Goring
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
can
I
permit
troops
,
that
will
be
invaluable
to
his
majesty
at
this
juncture
,
to
be
sacrificed
in
a
useless
enterprise
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
frank
with
your
lordship
.
<EOS>
Neither
the
king
nor
his
council
think
you
are
serving
the
royal
cause
in
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
""Not
serving
it
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
have
me
do
?
<EOS>
I
have
just
taken
Lancaster
and
Preston
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
you
can
hold
neither
place
,
"
said
Goring
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
am
certain
his
majesty
would
not
sanction
your
proposed
attack
on
Manchester
.
<EOS>
I
have
commissions
for
Lord
Molineux
and
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
,
empowering
them
to
recruit
their
regiments
from
your
last
levies
,
and
to
join
the
king
immediately
at
Oxford
.
<EOS>
""Since
<EOS>
such
are
his
majesty
's
commands
I
shall
not
oppose
them
,
"
said
the
earl
;
"
though
I
feel
I
should
best
serve
him
by
acting
contrary
to
his
orders
.
<EOS>
However
prejudicial
to
<EOS>
the
royal
cause
it
may
be
to
strip
Lancashire
of
its
defenders
,
I
am
ready
to
take
my
whole
force
to
Oxford
.
<EOS>
""That
is
not
needful
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Goring
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
king
desires
you
to
retain
such
troops
as
may
be
necessary
,
but
to
send
him
all
you
can
spare
.
<EOS>
""I
will
take
them
to
him
as
I
have
just
said
,
"
replied
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
lord
,
"
said
Goring
,
"
it
will
suffice
if
Lord
Molineux
and
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
join
his
majesty
.
<EOS>
Hereafter
,
if
required
,
you
can
follow
.
<EOS>
You
are
best
here
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
Lancashire
must
not
be
given
up
to
the
rebels
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
I
lose
my
men
<EOS>
,
I
can
make
but
<EOS>
a
poor
defence
against
the
enemy
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
But
his
majesty
shall
be
obeyed
.
<EOS>
My
men
are
ready
to
march
in
another
direction
—
but
it
matters
not
.
<EOS>
They
will
go
wherever
I
bid
them
,
and
though
I
doubt
not
they
will
regret
as
much
as
I
do
myself
that
the
attack
on
Manchester
is
abandoned
,
they
will
fight
well
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
my
whole
force
to
Warrington
,
where
I
will
leave
it
at
his
majesty
's
disposal
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
my
lord
,
I
must
take
the
greater
part
of
it
with
me
,
"
said
Goring
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
are
my
orders
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
shall
take
all
if
you
will
,
"
rejoined
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
"A
dozen
troops
of
horse
and
five
hundred
foot
will
suffice
for
the
present
,
"
said
Goring
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
shall
have
them
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
the
men
have
rested
,
we
will
set
out
.
<EOS>
"Two
<EOS>
hours
later
,
the
whole
force
that
had
just
arrived
at
Wigan
set
out
for
Warrington
.
<EOS>
As
Lord
Derby
had
anticipated
,
the
change
in
the
plans
gave
great
dissatisfaction
,
and
much
reluctance
was
expressed
by
some
of
the
soldiers
to
proceed
to
Oxford
.
<EOS>
During
the
whole
of
the
march
between
Wigan
and
Warrington
,
Lord
Derby
rode
by
himself
.
<EOS>
A
short
halt
was
made
at
Newton
,
but
even
then
his
lordship
seemed
in
no
humour
for
converse
.
<EOS>
Evidently
it
was
a
great
grief
to
him
to
part
with
his
army
,
and
he
could
not
conceal
his
vexation
.
<EOS>
The
whole
force
rested
that
night
at
Warrington
,
but
early
on
the
following
morning
,
the
chosen
regiments
set
out
for
Chester
on
their
long
march
to
Oxford
,
under
the
command
of
Lord
Molineux
and
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
.
<EOS>
Thus
checked
in
his
victorious
career
and
deprived
of
the
greater
part
of
his
force
and
his
two
most
efficient
commanders
,
Lord
Derby
could
not
but
feel
the
greatest
mortification
and
disappointment
.
<EOS>
Overcome
by
a
despondency
he
could
not
shake
off
,
he
remained
for
three
days
at
Warrington
,
when
news
was
brought
him
of
a
great
disaster
.
<EOS>
Wigan
had
been
captured
by
Colonel
Assheton
with
a
very
strong
force
,
consisting
of
upwards
of
two
thousand
men
,
and
the
town
plundered
.
<EOS>
Immediately
on
receiving
this
grievous
intelligence
,
Lord
Derby
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
two
troops
of
horse
which
were
all
that
were
now
left
him
,
and
rode
off
to
Wigan
to
see
what
could
be
done
.
<EOS>
With
him
was
Captain
Standish
,
who
had
only
joined
on
the
previous
day
.
<EOS>
The
second
troop
was
commanded
by
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
.
<EOS>
On
the
earl
's
appearance
before
the
recently
captured
town
,
the
fortifications
of
which
showed
how
much
it
had
suffered
from
the
recent
assault
,
Colonel
Assheton
immediately
sallied
forth
at
the
head
of
a
force
trebling
that
of
the
Royalists
.
<EOS>
A
very
sharp
conflict
ensued
,
during
which
many
were
slain
on
both
sides
,
but
at
length
the
earl
was
compelled
to
retreat
.
<EOS>
He
did
so
,
however
,
in
very
good
order
,
and
rode
with
his
company
to
Lathom
House
.

THE
SURRENDER
OF
WARRINGTONCHAPTER
<EOS>
IThe
Countess
proposes
to
write
to
Prince
RupertNATURALLY
,
the
unexpected
return
of
the
Earl
of
Derby
to
the
castle
under
such
circumstances
caused
great
consternation
.
<EOS>
The
whole
garrison
got
under
arms
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
his
lordship
had
ridden
through
the
gate
with
his
followers
,
the
drawbridge
was
raised
,
and
preparation
was
made
for
attack
.
<EOS>
After
dismounting
in
the
court
-
yard
,
the
earl
immediately
retired
with
the
countess
,
and
told
her
all
the
reverses
he
had
sustained
—
how
he
had
been
thwarted
in
his
intended
assault
of
Manchester
—
how
his
best
troops
had
been
taken
from
him
—
and
how
Wigan
had
been
captured
.
<EOS>
"Wigan
captured
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
countess
,
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
it
had
been
attacked
—
but
I
knew
not
it
was
taken
.
<EOS>
""It
was
taken
yesterday
by
Colonel
Assheton
,
and
is
now
in
the
hands
of
the
rebels
,
"
replied
the
earl
,
despairingly
.
"
<EOS>
Only
Warrington
and
this
stronghold
are
left
me
.
<EOS>
All
else
is
gone
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
despair
,
my
dear
lord
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
,
striving
to
cheer
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fortune
will
take
a
turn
.
<EOS>
""I
fear
not
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Things
will
get
worse
,
instead
of
better
.
<EOS>
Warrington
is
certain
to
be
attacked
by
the
rebels
,
but
it
is
well
fortified
and
well
garrisoned
,
and
may
hold
out
for
a
time
;
but
if
the
whole
county
is
in
the
hands
of
the
rebels
,
I
can
not
maintain
it
.
<EOS>
As
the
king
will
not
have
me
with
him
,
I
must
perforce
retire
to
the
Isle
of
Man
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
yet
,
my
dear
lord
—
not
yet
,
"
remonstrated
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
All
is
not
lost
.
<EOS>
I
will
write
to
Prince
Rupert
to
come
to
our
assistance
,
and
I
doubt
not
he
will
accede
to
the
request
.
<EOS>
""You
are
mistaken
,
my
dear
heart
.
<EOS>
Goring
and
Jermyn
,
and
the
rest
of
the
king
's
advisers
,
who
are
hostile
to
me
,
will
not
let
him
,
"
observed
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"Nevertheless
<EOS>
,
I
will
write
,
"
she
said
;
"
and
I
will
send
the
letter
by
Frank
Standish
.
<EOS>
""A
better
messenger
could
not
be
found
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
If
the
prince
will
bring
a
sufficient
force
to
Lancashire
,
all
will
be
right
.
<EOS>
But
I
fear
—
"
"
Have
no
fear
,
my
lord
,
"
cried
the
courageous
dame
.
<EOS>
"
All
will
yet
be
well
.
<EOS>
Go
forth
,
I
pray
you
.
<EOS>
See
your
children
.
<EOS>
Show
yourself
to
the
officers
of
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
I
will
join
you
as
soon
as
I
have
written
the
letter
to
Prince
Rupert
.
<EOS>
"Very
much
cheered
by
his
discourse
with
the
countess
,
the
earl
proceeded
to
the
great
hall
,
where
he
found
his
daughters
with
Doctor
Rutter
,
and
embraced
them
tenderly
,
and
then
cordially
greeted
the
chaplain
.
<EOS>
After
this
,
he
went
forth
into
the
court
-
yard
,
where
all
the
officers
of
the
garrison
were
assembled
.
<EOS>
Putting
on
as
cheerful
a
countenance
as
he
could
assume
,
he
thus
addressed
them:"You
have
heard
we
have
just
lost
Wigan
,
and
it
is
doubtless
a
very
heavy
blow
to
us
,
and
a
great
gain
to
the
rebels
,
but
rest
assured
we
shall
recover
the
town
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
we
have
Warrington
,
which
is
strongly
fortified
,
and
which
we
can
hold
till
we
receive
assistance
from
the
king
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
the
assistance
may
not
be
delayed
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Captain
Chisenhale
.
<EOS>
"When
<EOS>
his
majesty
learns
how
we
are
situated
<EOS>
,
I
trust
he
will
send
Prince
Rupert
to
our
assistance
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
These
words
,
and
the
tone
in
which
they
were
spoken
,
produced
an
excellent
effect
on
the
officers
,
who
had
been
much
depressed
by
the
loss
of
Wigan
.
<EOS>
The
earl
next
carefully
inspected
the
whole
garrison
,
and
by
his
manner
inspired
confidence
in
the
men
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIWhat
passed
between
Standish
and
GertrudeMEANTIME
,
Frank
Standish
had
gone
in
quest
of
Engracia
and
her
father
.
<EOS>
But
before
he
could
find
them
,
he
encountered
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"I
grieve
to
hear
you
have
lost
Wigan
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"Yes
,
the
town
was
taken
yesterday
by
Colonel
Assheton
,
with
the
aid
of
your
father
,
"
he
replied
,
gloomily
.
"Was
<EOS>
my
father
with
Colonel
Assheton
?
<EOS>
"
she
inquired
.
<EOS>
"He
was
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"I
am
sorry
for
it
,
"
she
rejoined
.
"
<EOS>
But
do
not
reproach
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
to
blame
.
<EOS>
""The
rebels
will
attack
Warrington
next
,
and
your
father
may
give
them
further
aid
.
<EOS>
""Yes
<EOS>
,
I
see
,
that
is
possible
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
to
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
will
you
do?""I
will
go
to
Wigan
and
talk
to
him
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
may
listen
to
my
entreaties
.
<EOS>
""That
is
not
very
likely
.
<EOS>
But
the
countess
will
not
allow
you
to
leave
Lathom
House
on
such
an
errand
.
<EOS>
""I
will
find
some
means
of
getting
away
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"Do
not
come
to
any
decision
till
you
have
spoken
further
with
me
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
Engracia
was
seen
approaching
with
her
father
,
and
Standish
went
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
"Ah
<EOS>
,
my
young
friend
,
I
rejoice
to
see
you
,
"
said
Don
Fortunio
.
<EOS>
"
But
is
it
true
you
have
sustained
a
<EOS>
reverse?""Yes
,
we
have
lost
an
important
town
,
"
replied
Standish
;
"
and
one
I
thought
perfectly
safe
.
<EOS>
All
our
late
successes
will
now
go
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
Warrington
alone
remains
to
us
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
this
castle
,
"
cried
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"Yes
<EOS>
,
<EOS>
but
if
Warrington
falls
,
Lathom
House
will
be
besieged
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
you
ought
to
remain
here?""I
am
not
at
all
afraid
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
quite
safe
with
the
countess
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
not
know
what
a
siege
is
like
,
my
child
,
"
cried
Don
Fortunio
.
<EOS>
"
The
matter
requires
consideration
.
<EOS>
Would
it
be
possible
to
quit
the
castle
<EOS>
now?""Yes
,
but
a
few
days
hence
it
may
be
too
late
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"I
do
not
wish
to
go
,
dear
father
,
"
said
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
desire
to
depart
,
leave
me
here
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
the
countess
appeared
with
her
daughters
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
letter
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"I
was
looking
for
you
,
Captain
Standish
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
take
this
letter
to
Prince
Rupert
.
<EOS>
""To
Prince
Rupert
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
Unless
I
am
misinformed
,
his
highness
is
at
Oxford
with
the
king
.
<EOS>
""It
is
to
Oxford
<EOS>
you
will
have
to
proceed
,
"
replied
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
deem
the
journey
too
long
,
I
will
send
another
messenger
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
journey
is
not
too
long
for
me
,
madam
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
have
my
lord
's
consent
I
will
willingly
take
the
letter
.
<EOS>
""His
<EOS>
lordship
has
selected
you
for
the
errand
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
I
will
set
out
at
once
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"I
felt
sure
I
could
rely
on
you
,
"
she
rejoined
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
deliver
this
letter
into
the
prince
's
own
hands
as
speedily
as
may
be
,
and
bring
me
back
an
answer
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
will
,
madam
,
"
he
replied
,
placing
the
letter
in
his
doublet
.
<EOS>
Just
then
Lord
Derby
came
up
,
and
finding
that
the
countess
had
already
entrusted
her
letter
to
Standish
,
he
took
him
aside
,
and
charged
him
with
a
message
to
Prince
Rupert
.
<EOS>
"You
will
be
able
to
describe
to
his
highness
the
exact
state
of
affairs
in
Lancashire
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
I
deem
it
utterly
impossible
to
hold
out
much
longer
without
assistance
.
<EOS>
Had
I
succeeded
in
taking
Manchester
,
all
would
have
been
well
;
but
now
the
prospect
is
,
indeed
,
dark
.
<EOS>
""I
will
explain
all
to
his
highness
,
"
said
Standish
;
"
and
should
I
obtain
an
interview
of
the
king
<EOS>
,
I
will
tell
his
majesty
exactly
how
your
lordship
is
circumstanced
.
<EOS>
""You
are
a
trusty
messenger
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
tell
you
to
lose
no
time
on
the
journey
.
<EOS>
Take
half
a
dozen
men
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
not
set
out
till
night
.
<EOS>
"Promising
to
obey
his
lordship
's
direction
,
Standish
went
to
choose
the
men
,
and
as
he
proceeded
to
the
stables
,
he
met
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
me
be
one
of
your
attendants
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"You
!
"
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"Yes
.
<EOS>
I
have
still
my
costume
as
a
cavalier
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
you
forget
the
distance
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
You
could
not
ride
from
this
place
to
Oxford
.
<EOS>
""I
think
I
could
,
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
not
desire
to
go
further
than
Wigan
.
<EOS>
Get
me
through
the
gates
,
and
across
the
drawbridge
,
and
I
will
soon
find
my
way
to
my
father
.
<EOS>
""I
see
your
purpose
,
"
he
replied
,
"
and
will
aid
you
.
<EOS>
You
shall
pass
out
with
me
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
A
horse
and
all
equipments
shall
be
found
you
.

<EOS>
IIIHow
Gertrude
accompanied
StandishHaving
made
all
necessary
arrangements
,
Standish
returned
to
the
court
-
yard
,
where
he
found
Engracia
and
her
attendant
Maria
.
<EOS>
"I
am
sorry
we
shall
soon
lose
you
again
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
hear
you
are
starting
on
another
expedition
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
How
long
shall
you
be
absent?""I
can
scarcely
tell
,
"
he
replied
;
"
but
I
suppose
three
or
four
days
.
<EOS>
Should
I
not
return
,
I
hope
you
will
think
of
me
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
trifle
with
me
,
"
she
rejoined
,
with
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
cease
to
think
of
you
.
<EOS>
But
when
you
do
return
,
I
hope
you
will
stay
here
.
<EOS>
""I
know
not
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
obey
orders
.
<EOS>
But
unless
shut
up
,
I
shall
not
stay
here
long
.
<EOS>
When
I
return
from
my
mission
I
shall
be
posted
with
my
lord
at
Warrington
.
<EOS>
""Is
Warrington
far
from
this
castle
?
<EOS>
"
she
inquired
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
much
more
than
an
hour
's
ride
.
<EOS>
If
the
rebels
will
let
me
,
I
shall
often
come
and
see
you
.
<EOS>
""You
must
not
expose
yourself
to
risk
on
my
account
,
"
she
said
,
tenderly
.
<EOS>
"
But
pray
inform
me
of
your
return
.
<EOS>
The
time
will
pass
wearily
till
then
.
<EOS>
""That
<EOS>
it
will
,
I
am
sure
,
señorita
,
"
remarked
Maria
.
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
señor
,
my
young
lady
thinks
only
of
you
.
<EOS>
""Fie
,
Maria
!
<EOS>
"
cried
her
mistress
.
<EOS>
"
You
should
not
betray
secrets
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
it
is
right
<EOS>
the
caballero
should
know
how
much
you
care
for
him
,
"
said
Maria
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
console
him
.
<EOS>
""You
are
right
,
"
cried
Standish
.
<EOS>
In
such
discourse
as
this
they
passed
away
the
time
,
and
so
engrossed
were
they
by
each
other
,
that
they
were
quite
unaware
<EOS>
they
were
watched
by
the
jealous
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
In
obedience
to
the
earl
's
injunctions
,
Standish
did
not
prepare
to
start
on
his
perilous
journey
till
it
became
dark
.
<EOS>
He
had
already
chosen
five
attendants
,
but
it
was
not
till
the
last
moment
that
the
sixth
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
The
youth
had
a
slight
figure
,
and
scarcely
looked
equal
to
the
journey
,
but
was
well
mounted
.
<EOS>
Standish
had
taken
leave
of
the
earl
and
countess
,
so
that
no
delay
occurred
.
<EOS>
The
gate
was
thrown
open
,
the
drawbridge
lowered
,
and
Standish
rode
forth
with
his
attendants
,
and
took
his
way
along
a
lane
leading
to
Skelmersdale
.
<EOS>
Thence
they
galloped
across
Holland
Moor
to
Pemberton
,
which
was
nothing
more
than
a
small
collection
of
cottages
and
an
old
hall
.
<EOS>
From
this
place
a
narrow
lane
brought
them
to
a
high
road
,
when
Standish
came
to
a
halt
,
and
said
in
a
low
tone
to
the
youthful
attendant
<EOS>
we
have
mentioned:"This
<EOS>
is
your
road
to
Wigan
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
much
more
than
a
mile
off
.
<EOS>
Adieu!"Without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
dashed
off
on
the
right
,
followed
by
his
other
attendants
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IVHow
Gertrude
found
her
Father
at
WiganTHE
youth
remained
stationary
for
a
moment
,
and
then
rousing
himself
,
took
the
course
indicated
by
his
leader
.
<EOS>
Very
shortly
he
came
in
sight
of
a
large
town
,
which
,
even
in
the
gloom
,
he
could
see
was
surrounded
by
partly
-
demolished
fortifications
.
<EOS>
Presently
he
was
challenged
by
an
advanced
guard
stationed
in
front
of
the
gate
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>
are
you
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
a
hoarse
voice
.
<EOS>
"A
friend
,
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
"Are
<EOS>
you
alone
?
"
demanded
the
guard
.
<EOS>
"Yes
<EOS>
—
alone
.
<EOS>
"Two
<EOS>
musketeers
then
stepped
forward
to
reconnoitre
the
stranger
,
and
the
foremost
<EOS>
inquired:"What
is
your
business
here
at
this
hour?""I
desire
to
see
Colonel
Rosworm
,
"
replied
the
youth
.
<EOS>
"
I
pray
you
take
me
to
him
.
<EOS>
""It
is
too
late
,
"
replied
the
musketeer
,
gruffly
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
enter
the
town
.
<EOS>
Go
your
way
.
<EOS>
Return
to
-
morrow
morning
if
you
list
.
<EOS>
""It
is
important
that
I
should
see
Colonel
Rosworm
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Will
you
take
a
message
from
me
to
him?""No
,
"
was
the
stern
answer
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
retired
to
rest
,
and
I
will
not
disturb
him
.
<EOS>
""He
is
yonder
.
<EOS>
I
hear
his
voice
.
"And
<EOS>
the
youth
called
out
a
few
words
in
German
which
evidently
reached
Rosworm
's
quick
ears
,
for
he
hastened
to
the
spot
.
<EOS>
The
musketeers
could
not
understand
what
passed
between
Rosworm
and
the
stranger
,
for
their
discourse
was
conducted
in
a
language
unknown
to
them
;
but
they
were
surprised
when
the
great
German
engineer
took
the
new
comer
's
horse
by
the
bridle
,
and
led
him
through
the
gate
into
the
town
,
saying
to
the
guard
,
"
It
is
all
right
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
this
manner
they
proceeded
along
the
main
street
till
they
came
to
a
large
house
,
at
the
entrance
of
which
sentinels
were
placed
.
<EOS>
Here
they
stopped
.
<EOS>
The
youth
dismounted
,
and
giving
his
horse
to
one
of
the
sentinels
,
followed
his
conductor
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
Several
Roundhead
soldiers
made
their
appearance
in
the
passage
,
but
retired
on
a
word
from
Rosworm
,
who
ushered
the
stranger
into
a
large
room
,
dimly
lighted
by
a
lamp
,
where
they
were
quite
alone
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
was
the
door
closed
,
than
the
engineer
affectionately
embraced
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"I
ought
to
chide
thee
severely
for
thy
conduct
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
voice
in
which
anger
struggled
with
tenderness
;
"
but
I
can
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
thought
thou
hadst
left
me
for
ever
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
so
,
dear
father
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
always
ready
to
return
to
you
,
but
I
can
not
endure
these
rebels
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
why
come
here
,
where
thou
art
in
the
midst
of
them
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"Because
<EOS>
I
have
something
important
to
say
to
you
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Are
you
content
with
the
mischief
you
have
done
to
this
town?""What
mean'st
thou
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
be
content
till
I
have
fulfilled
my
engagement
.
<EOS>
I
have
undertaken
to
deliver
all
the
towns
in
Lancashire
to
the
Parliament
.
<EOS>
""I
feared
as
much
,
dear
father
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
hope
to
dissuade
you
from
your
cruel
purpose
.
<EOS>
""Thou
<EOS>
wilt
fail
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"I
trust
not
.
<EOS>
You
will
listen
to
what
I
have
to
say?""Humph
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
mere
waste
of
time
.
<EOS>
I
will
promise
not
to
assist
in
any
attack
on
Lathom
House
—
but
Warrington
is
different
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
you
will
not
be
able
to
take
the
place
,
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"Indulge
<EOS>
no
such
notion
<EOS>
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
Wigan
was
more
strongly
fortified
than
any
other
town
in
Lancashire
,
and
you
see
how
soon
it
fell
.
<EOS>
We
shall
make
short
work
with
Warrington
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
you
may
be
unsuccessful
,
father
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
if
I
am
permitted
I
will
fight
against
you
.
<EOS>
""You
will
not
have
the
opportunity
of
doing
so
,
child
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
remain
here
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
""May
<EOS>
I
not
return
to
Lathom
House?""Not
till
after
the
capture
of
Warrington
,
"
he
rejoined
,
in
a
decided
tone
.
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
thought
of
this
before
you
came
hither
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
father
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
"
I
judged
you
very
differently
.
<EOS>
""I
detain
you
against
my
will
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
compel
me
to
act
thus
by
your
indiscretion
.
<EOS>
Were
I
to
let
you
go
,
my
motives
would
be
misconstrued
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
this
is
your
fixed
determination
,
father
,
<EOS>
I
shall
try
to
escape
,
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"Act
<EOS>
as
you
think
proper
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
suffer
thee
to
depart
.
<EOS>
""Father
<EOS>
,
"
she
implored
,
"
I
pray
you
let
me
go
!
<EOS>
Do
not
drive
me
to
some
desperate
act
.
<EOS>
"Rosworm
could
not
resist
her
entreaties
.
<EOS>
"I
ought
not
to
yield
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
thou
hast
placed
me
in
a
disagreeable
dilemma
,
and
perhaps
this
is
the
best
way
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
Come
,
then
,
I
will
go
with
thee
to
the
gate
.
<EOS>
"Without
<EOS>
another
word
he
left
the
room
,
and
she
followed
him
.
<EOS>
The
horse
was
instantly
brought
by
the
guard
,
and
when
Gertrude
had
gained
the
saddle
,
Rosworm
walked
by
her
side
to
the
gate
.
<EOS>
Thus
escorted
,
no
question
was
asked
,
and
no
hindrance
offered
to
her
departure
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VHow
Gertrude
warned
the
Earl
that
Warrington
was
in
dangerGertrude
had
failed
in
her
errand
.
<EOS>
She
had
found
her
father
impracticable
,
but
she
had
ascertained
that
Warrington
was
to
be
attacked
on
the
morrow
,
and
resolved
to
warn
the
Earl
of
Derby
that
the
town
was
in
danger
.
<EOS>
She
hastened
back
as
fast
as
she
could
to
Lathom
,
and
met
with
no
hindrance
on
the
way
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
the
castle
,
some
explanation
was
necessary
to
the
guard
,
but
they
were
quickly
satisfied
,
and
admittance
was
given
her
.
<EOS>
Her
first
business
was
to
obtain
an
audience
of
the
earl
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
he
had
not
retired
to
rest
,
but
was
engaged
in
converse
with
the
countess
and
Doctor
Rutter
in
a
small
chamber
adjoining
the
great
hall
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
admittance
to
him
,
but
some
explanation
was
necessary
to
account
for
her
appearance
in
male
attire
.
<EOS>
She
concealed
nothing
from
the
earl
,
and
told
him
she
had
been
to
Wigan
,
and
detailed
all
that
had
passed
between
her
and
her
father
,
adding
,
in
conclusion:"I
am
certain
Warrington
will
be
attacked
tomorrow
morning
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
that
case
,
I
must
go
there
to
-
night
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
only
take
the
two
regiments
I
brought
with
me
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
The
men
must
get
ready
instantly
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
disturb
the
garrison
here
.
<EOS>
You
have
rendered
me
good
service
,
"
he
added
to
Gertrude
,
"
and
I
thank
you
.
<EOS>
""I
am
sorry
I
could
not
serve
you
better
,
my
lord
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
should
like
to
go
with
you
to
Warrington
—
if
I
may
be
permitted
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
admire
your
spirit
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
refuse
your
request
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
then
went
forth
to
give
orders
for
the
immediate
departure
of
the
troops
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
the
trumpet
was
sounded
in
the
court
-
yard
,
and
in
reply
to
the
summons
the
men
came
forth
fully
equipped
.
<EOS>
Torches
were
lighted
,
so
that
the
assemblage
could
be
fully
seen
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
officers
of
the
garrison
at
Lathom
were
anxious
to
attend
his
lordship
,
but
were
not
allowed
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
earl
had
taken
leave
of
the
countess
.
<EOS>
Though
sorely
grieved
to
part
with
him
,
she
concealed
her
distress
,
and
strove
to
cheer
him
.
<EOS>
"Grieved
<EOS>
as
I
am
to
part
with
you
,
my
dear
lord
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
would
not
have
you
stay
,
but
would
rather
urge
your
departure
.
<EOS>
Whatever
may
chance
at
Warrington
,
have
no
fear
of
this
castle
.
<EOS>
Be
sure
I
will
keep
it
for
you
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
doubt
of
that
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
make
the
best
defence
I
can
,
but
should
Warrington
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
rebels
,
and
should
no
assistance
be
sent
by
the
king
,
I
shall
retire
to
the
Isle
of
Man
.
<EOS>
Thither
you
can
follow
with
our
children
.
<EOS>
And
now
farewell
,
dear
heart
,
I
will
not
say
for
ever!"Tenderly
embracing
her
,
he
bade
adieu
to
Doctor
Rutter
,
and
went
forth
into
the
court
-
yard
,
where
,
as
already
stated
,
the
two
regiments
were
drawn
up
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
had
mounted
,
trumpets
were
blown
,
the
gates
were
thrown
wide
open
,
and
the
earl
rode
forth
at
the
head
of
his
company
.
<EOS>
Passing
through
a
wood
on
the
south
of
the
mansion
,
and
riding
as
rapidly
as
was
consistent
with
safety
across
a
wide
bleak
moor
to
Rainsford
,
the
earl
proceeded
through
Windle
and
Haydock
to
Newton
,
where
he
halted
for
a
short
time
,
and
ascertained
that
,
as
yet
,
Colonel
Assheton
had
made
no
movement
from
Wigan
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
small
Royalist
force
at
Newton
,
and
having
given
some
directions
to
its
leaders
,
the
earl
rode
on
with
his
company
to
Warrington
,
now
not
more
than
five
miles
distant
.
<EOS>
VlHow
Warrington
was
assaulted
by
Colonel
Assheton
and
Colonel
HollandStrongly
fortified
by
mud
walls
with
gates
,
posts
and
heavy
chains
,
and
numerous
outworks
in
advance
,
possessing
,
moreover
,
a
strong
garrison
<EOS>
,
the
ancient
town
of
Warrington
seemed
well
able
to
resist
any
attack
made
upon
it
.
<EOS>
The
river
Mersey
,
which
flowed
past
the
town
,
was
crossed
by
a
strong
stone
bridge
,
built
by
the
first
Earl
of
Derby
,
upwards
of
a
century
and
a
half
previously
.
<EOS>
With
its
walls
and
battlements
,
a
watch
-
tower
in
the
centre
,
and
an
engine
to
prevent
any
passage
over
it
,
this
ancient
bridge
constituted
a
powerful
defence
.
<EOS>
On
the
summit
of
the
church
-
tower
were
placed
two
small
pieces
of
ordnance
,
while
the
church
itself
was
converted
into
a
storehouse
for
ammunition
and
powder
.
<EOS>
From
its
well
-
planned
defences
,
its
position
on
the
Mersey
,
its
bridge
,
and
its
strong
garrison
,
Warrington
was
deemed
impregnable
.
<EOS>
The
governor
,
Colonel
Edward
Norris
,
who
acted
for
Lord
Derby
,
was
an
officer
of
great
bravery
and
unquestionable
loyalty
,
and
there
were
others
almost
equally
distinguished
in
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Derby
's
first
business
on
his
arrival
was
to
have
an
interview
with
the
governor
,
and
having
explained
the
position
of
affairs
,
he
threw
himself
on
a
couch
,
and
sought
some
repose
of
which
he
stood
greatly
in
need
.
<EOS>
When
he
awoke
,
he
learnt
from
the
scouts
that
the
enemy
was
advancing
with
the
evident
intention
of
investing
the
town
,
and
attacking
it
on
two
sides
—
the
force
on
the
west
being
led
by
Colonel
Assheton
,
that
on
the
east
by
Colonel
Holland
,
with
whom
was
Colonel
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
On
receiving
this
intelligence
,
the
earl
immediately
sallied
forth
at
the
head
of
a
large
troop
of
horse
,
and
attacked
Colonel
Assheton
near
Sankey
Bridge
,
driving
him
back
as
far
as
Burton
Wood
;
and
he
might
have
routed
the
whole
force
,
had
not
Colonel
Holland
sent
a
detachment
to
Assheton
's
aid
,
and
Lord
Derby
was
thereupon
compelled
to
return
to
the
town
,
or
his
retreat
would
have
been
cut
off
.
<EOS>
Not
long
afterwards
the
assault
was
commenced
by
Colonel
Holland
,
assisted
as
we
have
said
by
Rosworm
,
and
notwithstanding
the
vigorous
defence
made
by
Colonel
Norris
,
part
of
the
mud
walls
were
taken
,
and
it
seemed
certain
that
the
enemy
would
succeed
in
penetrating
into
the
town
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
who
was
riding
about
on
his
charger
,
declared
that
rather
than
the
enemy
should
capture
the
town
,
he
would
burn
it
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
When
Colonel
Holland
and
Rosworm
heard
of
this
threat
,
they
laughed
at
it
,
and
redoubled
their
efforts
to
advance
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
stopped
by
loud
explosions
,
which
proved
that
several
houses
had
been
blown
up
,
and
flames
were
soon
afterwards
perceived
bursting
forth
in
different
quarters
.
<EOS>
The
earl
had
executed
his
threat
.
<EOS>
All
the
habitations
nearest
them
were
on
fire
,
and
the
conflagration
,
aided
by
combustibles
,
was
rapidly
extending
along
the
main
street
.
<EOS>
Struck
with
consternation
at
this
spectacle
,
the
assailants
paused
in
their
efforts
,
and
considered
what
should
be
done
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
now
to
advance
without
exposing
themselves
to
the
greatest
risk
—
indeed
,
to
almost
certain
destruction
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
as
the
town
would
inevitably
be
burnt
down
,
little
would
be
left
them
but
the
mud
walls
.
<EOS>
From
information
which
they
obtained
,
they
learnt
that
Lord
Derby
and
Colonel
Norris
,
with
a
large
body
of
men
,
had
retired
to
the
church
,
where
they
were
secure
from
the
fire
,
as
well
as
from
attack
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
the
assailants
judged
it
their
wisest
course
to
retire
for
the
night
to
Sankey
,
and
wait
to
see
what
the
morrow
would
bring
forth
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
night
of
terror
and
surprise
.
<EOS>
More
than
half
the
town
was
on
fire
,
but
no
efforts
were
made
by
the
inhabitants
to
extinguish
the
flames
.
<EOS>
Most
of
them
had
crossed
the
bridge
,
and
found
shelter
at
Groppenhall
,
Thelwall
,
and
other
villages
.
<EOS>
But
the
besiegers
were
not
allowed
to
rest
at
Sankey
.
<EOS>
At
midnight
the
sentinels
were
shot
,
and
the
Parliamentarians
,
who
had
fancied
themselves
in
security
,
were
suddenly
roused
to
arms
.
<EOS>
The
foe
was
upon
them
.
<EOS>
A
fierce
fight
ensued
that
lasted
more
than
two
hours
,
and
ended
in
a
complete
rout
of
the
Parliamentarians
,
part
of
whom
returned
to
Wigan
,
and
the
rest
to
Manchester
.
<EOS>
Warrington
was
thus
delivered
from
the
rebels
,
and
though
the
town
suffered
as
much
as
it
would
have
done
had
it
been
ravaged
by
the
enemy
—
<EOS>
perhaps
more
—
not
a
murmur
was
heard
from
the
loyal
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
Every
assistance
in
his
power
was
rendered
them
by
the
earl
,
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
many
partly
consumed
dwellings
were
again
rendered
habitable
.
<EOS>
As
some
fears
were
entertained
that
another
attack
on
the
place
would
be
made
by
Colonel
Assheton
from
Wigan
,
Lord
Derby
remained
to
protect
it
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIIHow
Standish
returned
from
his
MissionIT
had
now
become
quite
evident
to
the
earl
that
unless
he
received
prompt
and
efficient
assistance
from
the
king
,
it
would
be
impossible
to
continue
the
struggle
.
<EOS>
He
looked
anxiously
for
Standish
's
return
,
but
nearly
a
week
elapsed
and
no
tidings
were
heard
of
him
.
<EOS>
One
evening
the
earl
had
mounted
the
watch
-
tower
on
the
bridge
,
and
was
gazing
at
the
river
flowing
through
the
narrow
arches
,
when
his
attention
was
aroused
by
the
sound
of
horses
'
feet
,
and
he
saw
a
Cavalier
advancing
rapidly
along
the
Chester
road
,
followed
by
some
half
-
dozen
attendants
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
Standish
?
<EOS>
He
watched
the
newcomer
anxiously
,
and
felt
convinced
he
was
right
in
the
supposition
.
<EOS>
Quitting
the
watch
-
tower
,
he
hastened
towards
the
gate
by
which
the
new
-
comers
would
have
to
enter
the
town
,
but
long
before
he
reached
it
,
Standish
had
obtained
admittance
.
<EOS>
On
descrying
the
earl
,
the
young
man
flung
himself
from
his
steed
,
and
giving
the
bridle
to
one
of
his
followers
,
hurried
forward
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
instantly
perceived
from
his
looks
that
he
brought
bad
news
,
and
inquired:"Have
you
seen
Prince
Rupert?""I
<EOS>
have
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Standish
;
"
and
I
bring
a
letter
from
his
highness
to
my
noble
lady
the
countess
.
<EOS>
""Is
it
favourable
?
"
cried
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
Will
the
prince
come
to
us?—will
he
bring
,
or
send
assistance?""He
<EOS>
can
not
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
The
king
will
not
allow
him
.
<EOS>
I
represented
your
lordship
's
position
exactly
to
his
highness
,
and
he
sees
your
peril
;
but
he
can
not
help
you
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
all
is
lost
!
"
cried
the
earl
,
in
a
voice
of
anguish
.
<EOS>
"
All
the
sacrifices
I
have
made
are
useless
.
<EOS>
You
see
that
this
town
has
been
burnt
.
<EOS>
It
was
destroyed
to
save
it
from
the
rebels
;
but
it
will
now
fall
into
their
hands
.
<EOS>
""I
trust
not
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
message
for
you
from
the
prince
.
<EOS>
""What
says
he
?
"
cried
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
counsels
your
lordship
to
retire
to
the
Isle
of
Man
,
and
remain
there
till
better
days
arrive
.
<EOS>
""He
is
right
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
find
a
safe
refuge
there
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
to
Colonel
Norris
.
<EOS>
"Proceeding
<EOS>
to
a
large
house
near
the
bridge
,
they
found
the
governor
of
the
town
.
"Captain
<EOS>
Standish
has
just
returned
from
Oxford
,
and
brings
me
bad
news
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
hope
of
assistance
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
it
will
be
useless
to
hold
out
,
"
observed
the
governor
.
<EOS>
"Quite
<EOS>
useless
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hoist
the
white
flag
,
and
make
the
best
terms
you
can
with
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
My
own
intention
is
to
retire
to
the
Isle
of
Man
,
and
there
abide
my
time
.
<EOS>
To
-
night
I
shall
go
to
Lathom
,
and
bid
farewell
to
the
countess
.
<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
you
not
take
her
ladyship
with
you
to
Castle
Rushen
?
"
asked
Colonel
Norris
.
<EOS>
"She
would
refuse
to
accompany
me
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
no
fear
for
her
safety
.
<EOS>
She
has
a
strong
castle
,
and
a
strong
garrison
,
and
can
defend
herself
.
<EOS>
Ride
on
to
Lathom
,
Frank
,
"
he
added
to
Standish
,
"
and
deliver
Prince
Rupert
's
letter
to
the
countess
.
<EOS>
Tell
her
that
Warrington
must
be
surrendered
.
<EOS>
Acquaint
her
with
my
resolve
,
and
say
I
will
be
with
her
before
midnight
to
bid
her
farewell
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
will
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
As
the
earl
evidently
wished
to
confer
with
the
governor
,
Standish
left
them
together
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
remained
for
an
hour
at
Warrington
to
rest
his
horses
and
men
,
and
then
,
after
receiving
the
earl
's
final
commands
,
set
out
for
Lathom
,
where
he
arrived
in
safety
,
and
delivered
the
missive
to
the
countess
,
informing
her
at
the
same
time
that
Warrington
was
about
to
be
surrendered
by
the
governor
.
<EOS>
Whatever
the
countess
felt
on
perusing
Prince
Rupert
's
letter
,
and
however
distressed
she
might
be
by
the
tidings
<EOS>
brought
her
,
and
her
lord
's
determination
to
return
to
the
Isle
of
Man
<EOS>
,
she
said
nothing
at
the
time
,
but
withdrew
to
her
own
chamber
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
quite
regained
her
composure
,
she
sent
for
Doctor
Rutter
,
and
passed
some
time
in
consultation
with
him
.
<EOS>
After
this
,
attended
by
the
chaplain
and
Standish
,
she
inspected
the
garrison
,
examined
the
stores
,
and
made
it
understood
by
all
the
officers
that
they
must
prepare
for
a
siege
.
<EOS>
They
all
displayed
the
utmost
zeal
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIIIHow
the
Earl
took
his
Departure
for
the
Isle
of
ManMIDNIGHT
came
,
but
the
earl
had
not
arrived
,
and
the
countess
began
to
feel
some
little
uneasiness
,
and
this
greatly
increased
when
another
hour
had
passed
by
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
Standish
entered
to
announce
that
her
lord
had
arrived
,
and
the
next
moment
the
earl
made
his
appearance
,
and
clasped
her
to
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"I
have
come
to
bid
you
adieu
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
regarding
her
tenderly
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
approve
of
my
resolution?""Entirely
,
"
she
replied
,
firmly
.
"
<EOS>
Since
assistance
has
been
refused
you
by
the
king
,
you
have
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Rutter
,
with
whom
I
have
conferred
,
is
of
the
same
opinion
.
<EOS>
""Since
<EOS>
Warrington
has
fallen
,
it
is
useless
to
continue
the
struggle
at
this
moment
,
"
said
the
chaplain
.
<EOS>
"
Therefore
you
will
be
best
away
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
am
<EOS>
I
justified
in
leaving
you
here
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
earl
to
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
lord
,
"
she
replied
firmly
,
"
unless
you
command
me
to
accompany
you
I
will
not
stir
.
<EOS>
Let
me
remain
here
.
<EOS>
I
will
keep
this
castle
for
you
against
all
the
combined
forces
of
your
enemies
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
they
may
not
attack
me
.
<EOS>
""Expect
<EOS>
no
consideration
from
them
,
"
he
rejoined
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
not
thwart
you
.
<EOS>
I
commit
this
castle
to
your
charge
.
<EOS>
""And
I
will
keep
it
for
you
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
courageous
lady
,
in
a
tone
that
electrified
her
hearers
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
yield
it
,
but
with
life
.
<EOS>
You
may
rely
on
me
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
know
it
,
"
he
replied
,
with
admiration
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
remain
with
her
ladyship
,
Rutter?""To
<EOS>
the
last
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
consider
it
my
duty
to
stay
with
her
,
since
she
may
need
counsel
and
consolation
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
not
a
single
person
in
the
garrison
who
will
quit
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
""I
think
not
,
"
said
the
countess
proudly
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
say
you
,
Frank
?
"
<EOS>
remarked
the
earl
to
Standish
.
"
<EOS>
Will
you
remain
here
,
or
accompany
me
to
the
Isle
of
Man?""Since
<EOS>
your
lordship
allows
me
the
choice
,
I
will
stay
here
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"I
felt
sure
you
would
so
decide
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
attend
me
to
Whitehaven
,
where
I
shall
embark
,
and
then
return
.
<EOS>
Go
and
prepare
,
I
shall
not
tarry
long
here
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
this
,
Standish
quitted
the
room
,
and
Doctor
Rutter
was
about
to
follow
,
but
the
earl
stopped
him
.
<EOS>
"Do
not
go
,
Rutter
,
"
he
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
say
in
private
to
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
you
not
see
your
children
ere
you
depart
,
my
lord
?
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
not
retired
to
rest
,
and
will
be
sadly
grieved
indeed
if
they
do
not
embrace
you
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
then
,
bring
them
to
me
at
once
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
Summoned
by
Rutter
,
the
three
noble
damsels
rushed
into
the
room
,
and
were
tenderly
embraced
by
their
father
,
who
blessed
them
as
he
strained
them
to
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"You
will
soon
come
back
to
us
,
dear
father
,
will
you
not
?
"
<EOS>
they
cried
in
concert
.
<EOS>
"I
hope
so
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
If
not
you
must
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
Castle
Rushen
.
<EOS>
""We
would
rather
remain
at
Lathom
,
"
they
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"Ay
<EOS>
,
it
is
best
you
should
stay
with
your
mother
,
"
he
rejoined
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
adieu
,
my
darlings
.
<EOS>
If
I
remain
here
a
moment
longer
I
shall
never
be
able
to
tear
myself
away
.
<EOS>
"Again
<EOS>
embracing
them
all
—
again
clasping
the
countess
to
his
breast
,
he
hastily
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
In
the
court
-
yard
he
found
the
escort
he
had
brought
with
him
consisting
of
a
dozen
well
-
armed
and
well
mounted
troopers
—
not
more
.
<EOS>
All
the
officers
of
the
garrison
were
assembled
.
<EOS>
"Farewell
<EOS>
,
gentlemen
,
"
he
cried
,
as
he
sprang
into
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
"
I
commit
the
countess
and
my
children
to
your
care
.
<EOS>
""We
will
guard
them
with
our
lives
,
"
they
rejoined
with
one
voice
.
<EOS>
Attended
by
Standish
,
and
followed
by
the
troopers
,
the
earl
then
rode
through
the
gateway
.
<EOS>
His
heart
was
very
sorrowful
,
and
he
said
to
himself:"Shall
I
ever
return
here
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
ever
behold
these
dear
ones
again?"BOOK

THE
BELEAGUERED
MANSIONCHAPTER
IOf
the
Garrison
at
Lathom
HouseNEARLY
two
months
had
elapsed
since
the
Earl
of
Derby
's
departure
to
the
Isle
of
Man
,
where
he
had
been
occupied
in
repressing
a
threatened
insurrection
and
re
-
establishing
his
authority
,
and
though
Warrington
had
surrendered
,
and
almost
every
castle
,
or
fortified
mansion
in
the
county
was
now
in
the
hands
of
the
Parliamentary
leaders
,
no
attack
had
as
yet
been
made
on
Lathom
House
.
<EOS>
Its
real
strength
not
being
known
,
it
was
thought
the
castle
could
be
easily
taken
at
any
time
.
<EOS>
Though
the
countess
had
not
been
disturbed
,
she
was
virtually
a
prisoner
in
her
own
house
,
and
never
stirred
forth
without
a
guard
.
<EOS>
She
made
no
display
whatever
,
but
was
always
secretly
increasing
the
strength
of
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
castle
,
which
was
a
small
town
in
itself
,
was
in
a
perfect
state
of
defence
,
and
quite
capable
of
standing
a
lengthened
siege
.
<EOS>
Immediately
after
the
surrender
of
Warrington
,
a
summons
was
sent
by
Colonel
Holland
,
the
Governor
of
Manchester
,
to
the
countess
,
requiring
her
to
acknowledge
the
Parliament
,
or
deliver
up
her
mansion
,
but
to
this
demand
she
returned
a
haughty
and
peremptory
refusal
.
<EOS>
"Take
back
this
message
to
the
Governor
of
Manchester
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
nothing
derogatory
to
my
husband
's
honour
.
<EOS>
I
will
neither
acknowledge
the
Parliament
—
nor
give
up
my
house
.
<EOS>
But
I
promise
to
attack
no
one
—
and
only
to
defend
myself
.
<EOS>
All
I
desire
is
to
remain
here
peaceably
,
and
I
trust
I
shall
not
be
disturbed
.
<EOS>
"This
response
seemed
reasonable
to
Colonel
Holland
,
and
for
a
time
she
continued
unmolested
.
<EOS>
Not
desiring
to
give
the
enemy
a
pretext
for
assailing
her
,
the
countess
carefully
restrained
her
garrison
from
giving
them
any
provocation
,
and
forbade
them
to
plunder
any
houses
belonging
to
Parliamentarians
,
or
commit
any
outrage
whatever
.
<EOS>
They
might
defend
themselves
,
but
must
not
make
reprisals
.
<EOS>
By
this
judicious
conduct
she
remained
free
from
attack
,
and
was
enabled
to
strengthen
herself
,
and
add
to
her
stores
.
<EOS>
At
this
time
the
number
of
the
garrison
was
fully
three
hundred
men
,
many
of
whom
were
expert
marksmen
,
several
having
been
the
earl
's
keepers
and
fowlers
.
<EOS>
The
majority
were
armed
with
muskets
,
but
some
carried
long
fowling
-
pieces
and
screwed
guns
.
<EOS>
Sixteen
of
the
best
marksmen
kept
watch
on
every
alternate
night
,
while
an
equal
number
of
musketeers
occupied
the
towers
during
the
day
,
in
addition
to
the
engineers
who
had
charge
of
the
cannon
.
<EOS>
Besides
Standish
,
there
were
five
officers
,
whom
we
have
already
particularised
,
but
it
may
be
proper
to
call
over
the
roll
again
.
<EOS>
All
were
men
of
good
family
:
Henry
Ogle
of
Prescot
—
Edward
Chisenhale
of
Chisenhale
,
near
Chorley
—
William
Farmer
,
a
Scottish
gentleman
who
had
served
in
the
Low
Countries
—
Edward
Rawsthorne
of
New
Hall
—
<EOS>
Molineux
Radcliffe
,
a
relative
of
the
Radcliffes
of
Ordsall
—
and
John
Foxe
of
Rhodes
.
<EOS>
There
were
likewise
six
lieutenants
—
namely
,
Bretergh
,
Penketh
,
Walthew
,
Worrall
,
Kay
,
and
Halsall
.
<EOS>
Chief
in
command
was
William
Farrington
of
Worden
,
appointed
major
of
the
garrison
by
the
countess
.
<EOS>
He
had
suffered
much
for
his
attachment
to
Lord
Derby
and
loyalty
to
the
king
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
colonel
of
militia
,
and
a
commissioner
of
array
,
but
his
goods
were
seized
and
his
property
sequestered
by
the
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Major
Farrington
was
a
man
of
excellent
judgment
,
and
the
countess
had
entire
reliance
upon
him
,
and
consulted
him
on
all
occasions
.
<EOS>
Lady
Derby
had
now
three
chaplains
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Archdeacon
Rutter
,
with
whom
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
,
Doctor
Brideoake
,
and
the
Reverend
John
Lake
.
<EOS>
Service
was
always
performed
twice
a
day
in
the
chapel
,
and
on
special
occasions
more
frequently
.
<EOS>
Within
the
stronghold
the
greatest
order
and
discipline
prevailed
.
<EOS>
Not
one
person
had
been
punished
for
disobedience
or
neglect
of
duty
.
<EOS>
Already
,
we
have
endeavoured
to
familiarise
the
reader
with
the
appearance
of
this
proud
embattled
mansion
,
with
its
wide
courts
,
its
circuit
of
walls
,
its
great
gate
-
towers
,
its
broad
moat
,
strengthened
by
stout
palisades
on
either
bank
,
and
,
above
all
,
its
lofty
central
tower
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
again
refer
to
the
picture
,
in
order
to
notice
a
marked
change
that
had
taken
place
in
its
appearance
.
<EOS>
Though
more
strongly
garrisoned
than
formerly
,
Lathom
looked
less
menacing
.
<EOS>
In
each
tower
on
the
walls
were
six
pieces
of
ordnance
.
<EOS>
But
neither
engineers
nor
musketeers
were
visible
.
<EOS>
They
were
there
,
but
did
not
show
themselves
.
<EOS>
Only
on
the
gate
-
towers
could
the
guard
be
distinguished
.
<EOS>
No
banner
floated
as
of
yore
from
the
summit
of
the
Eagle
Tower
,
and
the
sentinels
seemed
to
have
been
removed
.
<EOS>
But
these
appearances
were
deceptive
.
<EOS>
Strict
watch
was
kept
night
and
day
on
tower
and
rampart
,
and
on
every
part
of
the
castle
.
<EOS>
That
officers
and
men
found
this
inactive
life
wearisome
is
certain
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
preferred
annoying
the
enemy
by
an
occasional
sortie
,
but
Major
Farrington
,
acting
upon
the
countess
's
instructions
,
would
not
permit
them
.
<EOS>
She
was
resolved
not
to
provoke
assault
.
<EOS>
It
surprised
her
that
the
enemy
allowed
her
to
remain
quiet
so
long
,
but
she
would
not
precipitate
matters
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
IIHow
Captain
Markland
brought
a
Letter
from
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
to
the
CountessAT
length
<EOS>
an
event
occurred
that
brought
about
the
attack
the
countess
had
been
so
studious
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
Her
chief
enemy
was
Colonel
Alexander
Rigby
,
an
active
Parliamentary
officer
,
who
harboured
a
strong
vindictive
feeling
against
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
and
now
sought
to
gratify
it
.
<EOS>
The
traitor
Bootle
,
who
had
only
been
severely
wounded
in
his
attempt
to
capture
the
queen
,
and
had
since
joined
Rigby
,
was
sent
by
him
to
plunder
the
countess
's
tenants
and
neighbours
,
and
arrest
all
who
attempted
to
take
refuge
in
the
castle
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
Don
Fortunio
and
his
daughter
had
been
allowed
to
remain
without
molestation
at
Knowsley
,
whither
they
had
removed
about
a
month
ago
,
but
now
they
were
taken
prisoners
by
Bootle
,
who
intended
to
carry
them
off
to
Wigan
,
but
was
prevented
.
<EOS>
Having
learnt
his
design
Standish
attacked
him
with
a
small
party
of
horse
,
rescued
the
captives
,
and
conveyed
them
safely
to
Lathom
.
<EOS>
In
this
skirmish
,
several
of
Bootle
's
men
were
wounded
.
<EOS>
Deeply
resenting
the
affront
,
as
he
conceived
it
,
Colonel
Rigby
immediately
represented
the
matter
to
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
general
of
the
Parliamentary
forces
in
Lancashire
,
who
was
then
in
Manchester
.
<EOS>
Reluctant
to
disturb
the
countess
,
Fairfax
at
length
yielded
to
Rigby
's
importunities
,
and
called
a
council
of
war
,
at
which
Colonel
Holland
,
the
Governor
of
Manchester
,
Colonel
Assheton
of
Middleton
,
Colonel
Moore
of
Bank
Hall
,
and
Rigby
himself
were
present
.
<EOS>
After
some
discussion
,
it
was
resolved
that
a
strong
force
should
be
sent
against
Lathom
,
and
the
countess
summoned
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
Immediate
warning
of
their
design
was
given
to
the
countess
,
who
had
a
spy
among
the
enemy
,
and
she
was
enabled
to
prepare
for
them
.
<EOS>
The
three
Parliamentary
leaders
,
however
,
gave
out
that
they
were
about
to
march
to
Bolton
and
Wigan
,
and
thence
to
Westmoreland
,
but
her
ladyship
was
not
surprised
to
find
they
had
fixed
their
quarters
at
various
points
round
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Next
day
,
Captain
Markland
,
the
Parliamentary
general
's
aide
-
de
-
camp
,
attended
by
a
small
guard
,
presented
himself
at
the
gate
of
Lathom
House
and
desired
admittance
,
stating
that
he
had
a
letter
for
her
ladyship
from
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
This
being
reported
to
the
countess
,
she
gave
orders
that
the
messenger
should
be
admitted
,
but
his
attendants
must
remain
outside
.
<EOS>
The
gate
was
then
opened
,
and
Captain
Markland
rode
into
the
court
-
yard
,
and
was
shortly
afterwards
ushered
by
Major
Farrington
into
the
presence
of
the
countess
.
<EOS>
Captain
Markland
was
tall
,
strongly
built
,
and
well
equipped
.
<EOS>
A
motion
with
a
ridge
on
the
top
,
a
gorget
,
cuirass
,
and
taches
met
by
immense
gambado
boots
formed
his
accoutrements
,
and
he
had
a
large
cutting
sword
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
On
approaching
the
countess
,
he
made
her
a
military
salute
,
which
she
haughtily
returned
.
<EOS>
"You
come
from
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
as
I
understand
,
sir
,
"
she
remarked
.
<EOS>
"I
am
the
bearer
of
a
despatch
from
the
general
to
your
ladyship
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
Taking
a
letter
from
his
belt
,
he
gave
it
to
Major
Farrington
,
who
handed
it
to
the
countess
.
<EOS>
Calmly
and
without
any
change
of
countenance
,
Lady
Derby
read
the
letter
,
and
then
said
to
the
messenger:"I
presume
you
are
aware
of
the
purport
of
this
missive?"Captain
Markland
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"It
is
a
requisition
from
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
"
he
said
,
"
enjoining
your
ladyship
to
yield
up
Lathom
House
on
such
honourable
conditions
as
he
shall
propose
.
<EOS>
""Does
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
require
immediate
compliance
with
his
injunction
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
<EOS>
"Even
<EOS>
so
,
madam
,
"
replied
Markland
,
"
<EOS>
And
I
trust
I
may
be
able
to
carry
him
back
an
answer
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
""You
are
in
a
strange
hurry
,
sir
,
"
remarked
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Think
you
I
can
decide
at
once
upon
a
matter
of
such
import
.
<EOS>
My
lord
has
left
me
in
charge
of
this
mansion
,
and
I
can
not
yield
it
up
without
due
consideration
.
<EOS>
I
require
a
week
's
delay
.
<EOS>
""I
am
not
prepared
to
say
the
delay
will
be
granted
,
madam
,
"
replied
Markland
,
"
but
I
will
deliver
your
answer
to
the
general
.
<EOS>
Do
you
hold
out
any
promise
of
compliance
at
the
expiration
of
that
time?""I
hold
out
nothing
,
"
replied
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
Put
any
construction
you
deem
proper
on
my
words
.
<EOS>
I
shall
consult
with
my
advisers
,
"
she
added
,
glancing
at
Major
Farrington
and
her
three
chaplains
who
were
standing
near
.
<EOS>
"I
trust
they
will
counsel
you
to
submit
to
necessity
,
madam
,
"
observed
Markland
.
<EOS>
Major
Farrington
would
have
spoken
,
but
the
countess
checked
him
by
a
look
and
said
haughtily
to
the
messenger:"Take
back
my
answer
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"Upon
<EOS>
this
,
Captain
Markland
bowed
and
retired
,
and
was
conducted
to
the
courtyard
by
Standish
.
<EOS>
As
he
mounted
his
steed
,
the
Parliamentary
officer
remarked:"We
shall
soon
be
masters
here
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
so
soon
,
"
rejoined
Standish
,
contemptuously
.

CHAPTER
IIIHow
Captain
Markland
brought
a
second
Letter
from
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
and
in
what
Manner
the
Countess
replied
to
itAFTER
this
visit
,
the
countess
was
allowed
to
remain
in
peace
for
a
few
days
,
but
from
the
summit
of
the
lofty
Eagle
Tower
she
perceived
that
her
enemies
were
increasing
in
number
,
and
drawing
the
cordon
of
troops
still
more
tightly
around
her
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Assheton
was
stationed
at
Burscough
Priory
and
Blyth
Hall
—
Colonel
Moore
was
near
Cross
Hall
—
and
Colonel
Rigby
at
Newburgh
.
<EOS>
As
to
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
she
learnt
from
her
scouts
that
he
had
taken
up
his
quarters
at
Knowsley
.
<EOS>
During
this
interval
,
she
restrained
her
soldiers
from
making
an
attack
on
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
fresh
provisions
had
been
regularly
brought
by
her
tenants
,
but
now
these
were
almost
entirely
cut
off
,
and
the
countess
was
most
unwilling
to
have
recourse
to
her
stores
.
<EOS>
Parties
of
the
enemy
were
constantly
on
the
watch
to
cut
off
supplies
.
<EOS>
The
utmost
enthusiasm
prevailed
in
the
garrison
;
officers
and
men
were
in
excellent
spirits
.
<EOS>
The
heroic
countess
had
inspired
them
all
with
an
ardour
and
zeal
akin
to
her
own
,
and
they
longed
for
an
opportunity
of
distinguishing
themselves
.
<EOS>
As
we
have
said
,
the
utmost
regularity
was
observed
.
<EOS>
The
men
were
daily
inspected
by
Major
Farrington
,
accompanied
by
Standish
or
some
other
officer
,
and
no
one
was
ever
found
absent
from
his
post
.
<EOS>
The
horses
were
regularly
exercised
in
the
court
-
yard
,
and
thereby
kept
in
health
and
good
condition
.
<EOS>
Nothing
,
in
short
,
was
neglected
.
<EOS>
The
routine
of
the
countess
's
life
was
exactly
the
same
that
it
had
been
.
<EOS>
Twice
in
each
day
,
sometimes
thrice
,
service
was
performed
in
the
chapel
by
Archdeacon
Rutter
,
Doctor
Brideoake
,
or
Mr.
Lake
,
and
she
always
attended
with
her
family
.
<EOS>
All
the
officers
of
the
garrison
,
and
such
of
the
men
as
were
not
actually
employed
,
together
with
part
of
the
household
,
likewise
attended
.
<EOS>
;
and
nothing
could
be
more
impressive
than
the
service
—
nothing
more
striking
than
the
picture
presented
by
the
chapel
filled
with
armed
men
surrounding
the
noble
lady
and
her
daughters
.
<EOS>
Their
deportment
was
most
serious
and
devout
.
<EOS>
At
these
services
Gertrude
Rosworm
was
always
present
.
<EOS>
On
the
third
day
after
Captain
Markland
's
visit
to
the
countess
,
another
letter
was
brought
her
by
the
same
officer
from
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
In
this
despatch
the
Parliamentary
general
regretted
that
he
could
not
accord
her
ladyship
the
delay
she
required
,
but
he
added
,
with
some
courtesy:"Since
nothing
can
be
arranged
without
a
conference
<EOS>
,
I
hope
your
ladyship
will
come
in
your
coach
to
Knowsley
,
where
I
and
my
three
colonels
will
meet
you
,
to
discuss
the
terms
of
surrender
.
<EOS>
You
need
have
no
apprehension
.
<EOS>
I
guarantee
your
personal
safety
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
countess
read
this
letter
with
great
indignation
.
<EOS>
"In
sending
this
message
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
,
scornfully
,
"
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
has
forgotten
what
is
due
to
my
lord
and
to
myself
.
<EOS>
I
decline
to
meet
him
and
his
colonels
at
Knowsley
.
<EOS>
If
they
desire
to
confer
with
me
they
must
come
here
.
<EOS>
It
is
meet
they
should
wait
on
me
,
not
I
on
them
.
<EOS>
""I
will
deliver
your
ladyship
's
message
,
"
replied
Captain
Markland
.
<EOS>
Later
on
in
the
same
day
he
returned
,
bringing
another
letter
from
General
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
to
say
that
he
did
not
desire
to
put
her
ladyship
to
inconvenience
,
and
would
,
therefore
,
wait
upon
her
next
day
,
at
Lathom
House
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
IVHow
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
came
to
Lathom
House
,
and
what
passed
between
him
and
the
CountessNEXT
day
,
about
noon
,
in
accordance
with
the
message
he
had
sent
,
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
attended
by
a
troop
of
horse
,
arrived
at
Lathom
House
.
<EOS>
Leaving
his
guard
at
a
short
distance
from
the
castle
,
he
rode
up
to
the
gateway
,
accompanied
only
by
Captain
Markland
,
thus
showing
the
perfect
reliance
he
had
on
the
countess
's
honour
.
<EOS>
The
distinguished
Parliamentary
general
was
then
about
thirty
-
three
,
but
looked
,
perhaps
,
a
little
older
.
<EOS>
Tall
,
and
well
-
proportioned
,
he
had
handsome
,
but
strongly
-
marked
features
,
characterised
by
a
grave
and
sombre
expression
.
<EOS>
He
had
more
the
air
and
manner
of
a
Cavalier
than
a
Roundhead
;
but
he
had
no
sympathies
whatever
with
the
Royalist
cause
.
<EOS>
Though
of
noble
birth
on
both
sides
,
being
the
son
of
Lord
Fairfax
by
Mary
,
daughter
of
the
Earl
of
Mulgrave
,
Sir
Thomas
preferred
a
democratic
form
of
government
,
and
hated
the
Court
.
<EOS>
Having
served
in
Holland
under
Lord
Vere
,
he
was
a
thorough
soldier
.
<EOS>
He
was
likewise
highly
accomplished
,
and
though
not
learned
,
well
read
.
<EOS>
Already
he
had
played
an
important
part
in
the
Civil
Wars
,
and
at
the
period
in
question
promised
to
become
the
foremost
man
in
the
Parliamentary
party
,
though
he
was
subsequently
overshadowed
by
the
bold
and
crafty
Cromwell
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
's
accoutrements
were
a
steel
cuirass
,
with
cuisses
,
and
buff
boots
,
and
his
sword
was
sustained
by
a
richly
ornamented
baldrick
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
a
steel
head
-
piece
,
however
,
he
wore
a
broad
-
leaved
hat
with
a
black
feather
.
<EOS>
As
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
rode
up
to
the
mansion
he
was
quite
surprised
at
the
formidable
appearance
it
presented
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
it
had
become
a
fortress
,
and
a
very
strong
one
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
as
we
have
shown
,
it
had
been
the
policy
of
the
countess
to
conceal
her
defensive
preparations
from
the
enemy
,
but
she
now
ostentatiously
displayed
them
.
<EOS>
The
aspect
of
the
place
was
altogether
changed
.
<EOS>
It
looked
threatening
and
defiant
.
<EOS>
A
broad
banner
floated
from
the
summit
of
the
Eagle
Tower
,
bearing
the
proud
motto
of
the
Stanleys
—
SANS
CHANGER
.
<EOS>
The
large
pieces
of
ordnance
on
the
high
turreted
gateway
,
and
in
the
numerous
towers
on
the
ramparts
,
were
unmasked
.
<EOS>
The
engineers
were
at
their
posts
,
and
the
walls
were
thronged
with
musketeers
,
Scanning
the
place
with
a
curious
eye
,
Fairfax
saw
the
strength
of
its
position
,
and
how
well
it
was
garrisoned
.
<EOS>
But
another
surprise
awaited
him
.
<EOS>
When
the
drawbridge
was
lowered
,
and
the
gates
were
thrown
open
to
admit
him
and
his
aide
-
de
-
camp
,
an
imposing
spectacle
was
presented
.
<EOS>
Two
hundred
stalwart
musketeers
,
fully
armed
and
equipped
,
and
having
their
lieutenants
with
them
,
were
ranged
in
double
lines
,
extending
from
the
gate
to
the
doorway
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
On
his
entrance
into
the
court
,
Fairfax
was
received
by
Major
Farrington
and
Captains
Standish
and
Chisenhale
,
all
three
fully
accoutred
,
and
as
soon
as
he
had
dismounted
,
he
was
conducted
by
the
major
along
the
living
avenue
we
have
described
to
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
As
he
marched
along
,
the
musketeers
were
struck
by
his
looks
and
martial
bearing
,
but
they
allowed
no
admiration
to
appear
,
and
regarded
him
sternly
.
<EOS>
Very
few
words
passed
between
the
Parliamentary
general
and
his
conductor
,
but
they
were
courteous
towards
each
other
.
<EOS>
More
musketeers
were
on
the
steps
,
and
the
doorway
was
environed
by
officers
of
the
household
.
<EOS>
Ceremoniously
conducted
to
the
presence
-
chamber
,
Fairfax
perceived
the
countess
at
the
upper
end
,
seated
like
a
queen
on
a
high
chair
,
with
her
daughters
beside
her
.
<EOS>
Near
her
were
her
three
chaplains
,
and
Captains
Rawsthorne
and
Molineux
Radcliffe
were
in
attendance
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
countess
keeps
a
court
,
I
perceive
,
at
Lathom
,
"
observed
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
to
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
expect
to
be
treated
with
so
much
ceremony
.
<EOS>
""Her
<EOS>
ladyship
desires
to
do
you
honour
,
general
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
<EOS>
As
Sir
Thomas
approached
,
the
countess
arose
,
and
received
him
with
stately
courtesy
,
praying
him
to
be
seated
.
<EOS>
"You
are
welcome
to
Lathom
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
she
said
,
"
albeit
you
come
as
an
enemy
.
<EOS>
""I
thank
your
ladyship
for
your
welcome
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
surprised
me
.
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
I
did
not
expect
to
find
you
<EOS>
so
well
prepared
.
<EOS>
""Doubtless
you
expected
to
find
me
ready
to
submit
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
she
said
,
with
a
haughty
smile
;
"
but
such
is
not
my
intention
.
<EOS>
""Resistance
to
the
forces
I
can
bring
will
be
useless
,
madam
,
"
he
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
therefore
,
your
ladyship
will
listen
to
the
conditions
I
have
to
propose
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
me
hear
them
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"From
the
display
I
have
just
seen
<EOS>
,
I
find
your
ladyship
has
a
large
stock
of
arms
,
and
I
doubt
not
abundance
of
ammunition
.
<EOS>
These
stores
must
be
delivered
up
to
me
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
demand
the
countess
's
attendants
exchanged
glances
.
<EOS>
She
answered
calmly
but
firmly:"When
<EOS>
I
procured
the
arms
you
have
just
seen
,
Sir
Thomas
,
and
such
munitions
of
war
<EOS>
as
I
possess
,
it
was
to
defend
myself
against
my
enemies
,
and
not
to
attack
them
.
<EOS>
Unless
my
house
had
been
strongly
garrisoned
,
I
should
have
long
since
been
driven
from
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
subjected
to
every
kind
of
provocation
and
annoyance
from
the
soldiers
of
the
Parliament
,
but
I
have
not
retaliated
,
and
have
restrained
my
own
officers
and
men
as
much
as
possible
.
<EOS>
""I
have
heard
otherwise
,
madam
,
"
rejoined
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
told
that
your
soldiers
have
been
in
the
habit
of
stripping
the
country
round
about
,
and
if
your
garrison
is
well
provisioned
,
such
must
have
been
the
case
.
<EOS>
I
am
also
informed
that
some
of
your
officers
have
seized
upon
several
persons
well
affected
to
the
Parliament
,
and
brought
them
as
prisoners
into
this
stronghold
,
demanding
large
sums
for
their
ransom
.
<EOS>
""Whoever
said
so
has
belied
me
,
"
remarked
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"I
can
give
a
positive
denial
to
that
statement
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
interposed
Major
Farrington
.
"
<EOS>
No
such
thing
has
occurred
.
<EOS>
""It
is
an
invention
of
the
false
traitor
Bootle
,
"
remarked
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
My
soldiers
are
not
marauders
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
dispute
the
point
,
madam
,
"
said
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
that
the
arms
and
ammunition
in
this
fortress
—
for
such
it
is
—
must
be
delivered
up
to
me
.
<EOS>
On
your
compliance
with
this
condition
,
I
engage
that
your
ladyship
and
all
your
family
and
household
,
with
all
officers
,
soldiers
,
and
others
,
composing
your
garrison
shall
be
suffered
to
depart
to
Chester
,
or
any
other
town
they
may
select
in
that
county
—
but
not
in
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
""I
will
answer
for
the
whole
garrison
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
observed
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"
Unless
by
her
ladyship
's
commands
—
not
an
officer
—
not
a
man
will
depart
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
we
,
her
ladyship
's
chaplains
,
"
added
Archdeacon
Rutter
,
"
refuse
to
leave
her
unless
in
obedience
to
her
injunctions
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
such
injunctions
I
shall
never
give
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"Neither
<EOS>
your
chaplains
nor
any
of
your
household
are
required
to
leave
you
,
madam
,
"
said
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
They
will
be
allowed
to
reside
with
you
at
Knowsley
,
which
will
be
placed
at
your
ladyship
's
disposal
on
your
submission
to
the
Parliament
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
proposition
<EOS>
all
the
countess
's
pride
was
aroused
,
and
she
said
haughtily
and
indignantly:"And
think
you
,
Sir
Thomas
,
that
I
would
act
disloyally
to
my
sovereign
,
and
undutifully
to
my
lord
and
husband
,
to
obtain
any
favour
from
the
Parliament
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
I
reject
the
offer
—
scornfully
reject
it
.
<EOS>
""Have
<EOS>
patience
,
madam
,
and
hear
me
to
an
end
<EOS>
,
"
said
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
prefer
it
,
you
shall
be
allowed
to
rejoin
the
earl
,
your
husband
,
in
the
Isle
of
Man
,
and
take
with
you
your
family
and
household
.
<EOS>
""Hear
<EOS>
me
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
cried
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Much
as
I
desire
to
behold
my
lord
and
husband
again
—
greatly
as
I
suffer
at
my
prolonged
separation
from
him
—
I
will
not
swerve
for
a
moment
,
even
in
thought
,
from
my
duty
.
<EOS>
Unless
my
lord
himself
commands
me
,
I
will
never
leave
Lathom
House
.
<EOS>
I
will
rather
perish
than
relinquish
my
charge
.
<EOS>
""Consideration
<EOS>
for
others
may
move
you
,
madam
,
"
remarked
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
daughters
,
I
doubt
not
,
would
fain
be
with
their
father
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
are
mistaken
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
said
the
Lady
Henriette
Marie
,
with
great
spirit
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
never
leave
our
dear
mother
,
the
countess
.
<EOS>
""Never
!
"
cried
the
two
others
with
equal
spirit
.
<EOS>
"We
will
perish
with
her
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
hear
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
said
the
countess
with
a
proud
smile
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
all
of
the
same
opinion
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
I
find
,
madam
,
"
replied
Fairfax
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
much
fear
I
may
be
compelled
to
have
recourse
to
extremities
,
which
I
am
most
anxious
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
However
,
in
the
hope
that
you
may
yet
change
your
mind
,
I
will
give
you
two
more
days
for
reflection
,
and
during
that
interval
I
shall
be
willing
to
receive
any
proposition
you
may
think
fit
to
make
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
able
advisers
with
you
,
"
he
added
,
glancing
at
Major
Farrington
and
the
three
divines
,
"
and
will
do
well
to
profit
by
their
counsel
.
<EOS>
""I
should
counsel
nothing
that
the
Earl
of
Derby
himself
would
not
approve
,
"
observed
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
am
certain
he
would
never
advise
a
surrender
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
interview

terminated

Bowing
to
the
countess

arose

returned
the
salutation
,
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
departed

He
was
attended
by
Major
Farrington

as
he
passed
through
the
lines
of
musketeers
,
who
were
still
stationed
in
the
court-
yard
,
there
arose
from
them
a
loud
shout

was
taken
up
by
their
comrades
on
the
towers

ramparts

<EOS>
"God

VHow
a
Stand
in

was
destroyed

Mill
burntFAIRFAX
rode
back
in
a
very
thoughtful
mood
to
Ormskirk
,
where
he
found
Colonel
Rigby
,
and
told
him
his
errand
had
been
unsuccessful

<EOS>
"I
expected
nothing
else
from
that
impracticable
and
imperious
dame

"
said
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
the
siege
will
commence
at

;
I
have
given
her
a
further
delay

two
days

replied
Fairfax

<EOS>
"I
am
sorry
for
it

"
said
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
will
be
gained
by
the
delay

<EOS>
""Perhaps
reflection
may
induce
her
to
submit

I
do
not

to
treat
her
harshly

Fairfax

On

be
done
.
<EOS>
Within
the
park
,
at
the
south
of
the
mansion
,
is
a
stand
from
which
the
earl
used
to
shoot
deer
.
<EOS>
Of
late
,
it
appears
,
this
stand
has
been
used
as
a
receptacle
for
provisions
—
carcases
of
sheep
and
oxen
—
which
have
been
secretly
conveyed
to
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
destroyed
.
<EOS>
""It
shall
be
,
"
said
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"There
is
also
a
windmill
on
the
road
to
Newburgh
,
which
I
make
no
doubt
the
countess
has
found
useful
.
<EOS>
No
more
corn
must
be
ground
there
.
<EOS>
""I
will
take
care
of
that
,
"
rejoined
Rigby
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
object
is
to
cut
off
all
supplies
,
"
observed
Fairfax
;
"
and
I
believe
the
loss
of
that
storehouse
in
the
park
,
together
with
the
windmill
,
will
seriously
inconvenience
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
doubt
it
not
,
"
said
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
instruct
Captain
Browne
,
the
engineer
,
to
draw
the
lines
round
the
mansion?""Ay
,
that
may
be
done
,
to
show
we
are
in
earnest
,
"
said
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
But
no
attack
must
be
made
till
the
siege
is
declared
.
<EOS>
"Rigby
<EOS>
immediately
proceeded
with
a
troop
of
horse
to
the
stand
in
the
south
park
.
<EOS>
Three
or
four
persons
were
within
it
,
but
they
fled
on
the
approach
of
the
Parliamentarians
,
leaving
behind
them
a
large
stock
of
meat
and
provisions
.
<EOS>
After
the
structure
had
been
demolished
,
Rigby
took
his
men
to
the
windmill
.
<EOS>
The
place
was
unguarded
,
and
no
one
was
to
be
seen
but
the
miller
,
who
resolutely
refused
them
admittance
,
and
drew
up
the
ladder
,
so
that
they
could
not
reach
the
door
,
which
was
high
up
in
the
building
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
he
himself
disappeared
.
<EOS>
With
some
difficulty
the
ladder
was
got
down
,
and
a
couple
of
troopers
mounted
it
,
but
the
foremost
stopped
at
the
door
,
for
he
discovered
that
the
interior
of
the
mill
was
on
fire
,
and
turning
round
,
communicated
this
disagreeable
information
to
his
leader
.
<EOS>
"Heed
<EOS>
not
the
fire
,
"
cried
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
Go
in
and
extinguish
it
.
<EOS>
""It
can
not
be
extinguished
,
"
replied
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
It
burns
furiously
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
enter
.
<EOS>
""What
has
become
of
the
miller
?
"
shouted
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
see
him
not
,
"
replied
the
trooper
.
"
<EOS>
But
most
assuredly
he
will
perish
in
the
flames
if
he
comes
not
forth
instantly
.
<EOS>
""Look
<EOS>
in
once
more
,
and
tell
me
if
there
is
much
corn
in
the
mill
,
"
said
Rigby
.
<EOS>
The
man
did
as
he
was
bidden
,
but
quickly
drew
back
his
head
,
and
dashing
down
the
ladder
,
upset
his
comrades
on
the
lower
steps
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
the
flames
burst
from
the
door
and
window
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
man
had
recovered
speech
,
Rigby
again
put
the
question
to
him:"Didst
thou
see
much
corn
in
the
mill?""Yea
,
verily
,
"
replied
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
It
seemed
to
me
filled
with
corn
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
let
it
burn
,
"
cried
Rigby
,
"
and
the
miller
with
it
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
without
making
an
effort
to
save
anything
,
he
rode
off
,
followed
by
his
men
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIWhat
happened
in
the
Ruins
of
Burscough
PrioryBETWEEN
Lathom
House
and
Ormskirk
,
in
the
midst
of
a
wood
,
stood
Burscough
Priory
—
a
large
religious
establishment
that
had
been
suffered
to
go
to
decay
.
<EOS>
But
the
ruins
were
very
picturesque
and
beautiful
,
and
contained
many
sculptured
shrines
and
other
monuments
.
<EOS>
Rigby
had
heard
of
the
priory
,
but
had
not
seen
it
,
and
he
now
determined
to
inspect
the
ruins
.
<EOS>
Taking
with
him
half
a
dozen
men
,
he
sent
the
rest
of
his
troops
to
Ormskirk
,
and
rode
through
the
wood
to
Burscough
.
<EOS>
Resolved
to
examine
the
interior
of
the
priory
,
he
dismounted
,
and
giving
his
horse
to
one
of
the
troopers
,
he
entered
the
ruins
,
but
had
not
advanced
far
,
when
,
to
his
surprise
,
he
saw
a
grave
-
looking
personage
advancing
towards
him
,
who
saluted
him
courteously
.
<EOS>
A
moment
's
reflection
convinced
Rigby
that
this
must
be
the
Spanish
gentleman
who
had
been
staying
at
Knowsley
,
and
he
therefore
said
to
him
sternly:"If
<EOS>
I
mistake
not
<EOS>
,
you
are
<EOS>
Don
Fortunio
Alava?"The
stranger
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
and
added
by
way
of
explanation
,
though
he
could
scarcely
make
himself
understood
,
since
he
spoke
English
with
difficulty:"I
have
come
hither
with
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
She
is
praying
at
a
shrine
yonder
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
disturb
her?""This
praying
at
shrines
,
and
worshipping
of
images
,
is
an
abomination
to
me
,
"
rejoined
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
here
—
in
this
retired
place
—
such
prayers
can
offend
no
one
,
"
protested
Don
Fortunio
.
<EOS>
"They
offend
me
,
"
said
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
Doubtless
you
have
come
here
from
Lathom
House?"Don
Fortunio
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"Then
return
thither
forthwith
,
"
said
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
well
for
you
that
there
is
a
truce
with
the
countess
,
or
I
had
made
you
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
""You
are
mistaken
,
Colonel
Rigby
,
"
said
Standish
,
suddenly
appearing
from
behind
a
monument
,
which
had
hitherto
concealed
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Don
Fortunio
Alava
and
his
daughter
are
not
unprotected
.
<EOS>
""They
should
have
kept
within
Lathom
House
at
this
time
,
"
said
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
If
they
give
my
soldiers
provocation
I
can
not
be
answerable
for
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
""What
provocation
can
they
give
your
men
?
"
demanded
Standish
.
<EOS>
"It
is
an
offence
to
them
that
Papists
should
come
here
to
pray
,
"
said
Rigby
;
"
and
they
will
not
permit
it
.
<EOS>
The
Spaniards
had
best
go
back
to
Lathom
House
.
<EOS>
""They
are
returning
to
Knowsley
,
whence
they
were
forcibly
taken
by
Captain
Bootle
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"That
can
not
be
permitted
,
"
rejoined
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"You
will
not
dispute
this
warrant
from
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
colonel
,
"
said
Standish
,
taking
a
paper
from
his
belt
.
<EOS>
"
By
it
Don
Antonio
Alava
and
his
daughter
,
with
her
attendant
,
are
licensed
to
reside
at
Knowsley
Hall
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
me
look
at
the
warrant
,
"
said
Rigby
.
<EOS>
After
glancing
at
it
he
said
,
sternly:"I
am
satisfied
.
<EOS>
You
are
at
liberty
to
conduct
them
to
Knowsley
—
but
you
yourself
must
return
to
Lathom
.
<EOS>
""Such
<EOS>
is
my
intention
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
Rigby
departed
,
and
mounting
his
horse
rode
off
with
his
men
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
was
gone
,
Engracia
and
Maria
made
their
appearance
from
another
part
of
the
ruins
.
<EOS>
"Heaven
be
praised
that
dreadful
man
is
gone
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
afraid
we
should
be
made
prisoners
.
<EOS>
""I
have
got
a
safe
-
conduct
for
you
from
the
general
,
"
replied
Standish
;
"
and
even
the
audacious
Rigby
would
not
dare
to
disobey
it
.
<EOS>
You
can
now
return
to
Knowsley
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
shall
be
afraid
to
remain
there
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"You
will
be
safer
there
than
at
Lathom
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
you
will
never
be
able
to
come
to
Knowsley
when
the
siege
commences
?
<EOS>
"
she
remarked
.
"Not
<EOS>
often
,
I
fear
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
All
communication
will
be
cut
off
by
the
enemy
's
lines
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
will
stay
at
Lathom
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
the
countess
may
not
desire
to
have
us
there
,
"
observed
her
father
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
not
presume
too
far
on
her
hospitality
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
us
see
her
once
more
,
dear
father
,
before
we
return
to
Knowsley
?
"
said
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"She
<EOS>
must
not
be
put
to
the
slightest
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
I
will
never
consent
to
that
,
"
said
Don
Fortunio
.
<EOS>
The
horsemen
whom
Standish
had
brought
with
him
,
and
Don
Fortunio
's
steed
,
and
the
two
palfreys
belonging
to
Engracia
and
her
attendant
,
were
in
waiting
at
the
back
of
the
ruins
,
and
so
well
concealed
,
that
they
had
escaped
the
notice
of
Rigby
and
his
troopers
.
<EOS>
On
the
arrival
of
the
party
at
Lathom
,
the
countess
chanced
to
be
in
the
court-
yard
,
and
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
declared
that
,
under
the
circumstances
,
they
ought
to
proceed
to
Knowsley
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
's
warrant
you
will
be
quite
safe
there
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
will
have
none
of
the
inconvenience
you
would
have
to
endure
here
.
<EOS>
"Engracia
<EOS>
would
much
rather
have
remained
at
Lathom
with
all
its
perils
,
but
Don
Fortunio
was
perfectly
satisfied
,
and
thanked
her
ladyship
for
her
consideration
.
<EOS>
So
they
set
out
at
once
for
Knowsley
,
and
were
escorted
thither
by
Standish
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIIOf
the
Message
brought
by
Colonel
Morgan
to
the
CountessNEXT
day
<EOS>
,
the
countess
prepared
for
the
reception
of
the
messenger
whom
she
knew
would
be
sent
to
her
by
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
About
an
hour
before
noon
,
Colonel
Morgan
arrived
,
attended
by
a
dozen
troopers
,
whom
he
was
obliged
to
leave
outside
the
gate
.
<EOS>
No
display
was
made
of
the
strength
of
the
garrison
,
as
was
done
when
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
visited
the
castle
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Morgan
dismounted
in
the
outer
court
,
and
was
at
once
conducted
to
the
countess
.
<EOS>
A
man
of
small
stature
,
with
a
very
fierce
expression
of
countenance
,
heightened
by
a
pair
of
piercing
black
eyes
.
<EOS>
His
manner
was
exceedingly
consequential
,
far
more
so
than
that
of
Fairfax
,
and
he
comported
himself
very
haughtily
towards
Major
Farrington
,
who
received
him
,
and
conducted
him
to
the
countess
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Morgan
had
won
a
considerable
reputation
for
activity
and
courage
,
and
was
reputed
a
very
skilful
engineer
.
<EOS>
As
he
marched
through
the
court
with
Major
Farrington
,
he
encountered
several
of
the
officers
,
and
eyed
them
sharply
,
almost
menacingly
,
and
he
also
glanced
inquisitively
at
the
ramparts
.
<EOS>
The
countess
received
him
in
the
presence
-
chamber
,
but
very
coldly
,
being
highly
displeased
by
his
manner
.
<EOS>
Only
Archdeacon
Rutter
and
Captain
Standish
were
with
her
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
In
a
somewhat
insolent
tone
he
informed
her
that
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
agreed
to
her
conditions
,
and
would
allow
her
to
take
her
children
,
her
chaplains
,
and
her
servants
to
the
Isle
of
Man
,
but
she
must
disband
all
her
men
,
and
prepare
to
receive
an
officer
and
forty
Parliamentary
soldiers
as
her
guard
.
<EOS>
"Disband
<EOS>
all
my
men
?
"
cried
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"Before
<EOS>
noon
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Colonel
Morgan
,
peremptorily
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
you
,
I
presume
,
are
the
officer
in
command
?
<EOS>
"
remarked
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
ladyship
has
guessed
aright
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
trust
I
shall
be
able
to
carry
back
a
satisfactory
answer
to
the
general
.
<EOS>
""You
will
tell
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
that
I
refuse
his
proposition
—
entirely
refuse
it
,
"
she
rejoined
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
am
heartily
glad
he
has
refused
mine
.
<EOS>
Were
it
to
save
my
life
<EOS>
I
would
not
renew
the
offer
.
<EOS>
Had
my
lord
been
in
command
here
<EOS>
you
had
not
dared
to
offer
this
insult
to
him,""No
insult
is
intended
to
your
ladyship
,
"
re
-
marked
Colonel
Morgan
.
<EOS>
"
The
general
merely
requires
you
to
disband
your
garrison
.
<EOS>
""Is
it
<EOS>
not
an
affront
to
send
such
a
message
to
me
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did
Sir
Thomas
expect
compliance
?
<EOS>
If
he
did
,
he
little
knows
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
ready
to
resist
his
utmost
violence
,
and
trust
in
Heaven
for
protection
and
deliverance
.
<EOS>
As
to
you
,
sir
,
who
have
dared
to
bring
me
this
insolent
message
,
and
have
ventured
to
intimate
to
me
that
you
are
appointed
to
the
command
of
the
castle
—
you
shall
never
set
foot
in
it
again
.
<EOS>
""I
may
not
be
admitted
,
madam
,
but
it
is
possible
I
may
enter
,
nevertheless
,
"
said
Morgan
,
boldly
.
<EOS>
"Shall
<EOS>
I
cast
him
forth
,
madam
,
for
his
insolence
and
presumption
?
"
cried
Standish
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
,
I
have
promised
him
free
access
and
a
safe
return
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
has
abused
his
license
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
desire
to
offend
your
ladyship
,
and
am
sorry
if
I
have
done
so
,
"
said
Colonel
Morgan
,
in
a
slightly
apologetic
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
share
in
the
high
respect
which
the
general
bears
for
you
,
and
regret
that
you
will
not
submit
to
the
ordinances
of
the
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Resistance
will
be
impossible
against
the
large
force
we
shall
bring
,
and
by
which
the
castle
will
very
shortly
be
completely
invested
.
<EOS>
We
have
ordnance
of
the
largest
size
,
bombards
,
basilisks
,
and
a
great
mortar
,
that
will
cast
forth
grenades
that
can
not
fail
to
burn
down
the
place
.
<EOS>
""I
fear
not
your
grenades
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
Heaven
will
protect
me
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
terrible
mortar
will
do
us
no
mischief
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
take
it
from
you
.
<EOS>
""That
is
not
all
,
"
said
Morgan
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
proceed
against
you
by
sap
and
mine
.
<EOS>
""We
will
meet
you
however
you
may
come
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"Enough
<EOS>
of
this
,
"
cried
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
I
make
no
boast
of
my
strength
,
but
my
cause
is
just
,
and
I
am
assured
it
will
triumph
.
<EOS>
""May
<EOS>
I
have
a
word
more
with
your
ladyship
ere
I
depart
?
"
said
Morgan
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
authorised
by
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
to
grant
you
another
day
's
delay
if
you
desire
it
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
be
beholden
to
your
general
for
any
further
favour
,
"
replied
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
Let
him
come
how
he
will
,
and
when
he
will
,
he
shall
find
me
prepared

Conduct
the
messenger
to
the
gate

"While
<EOS>
mounting
his
horse
in
the
court
-
yard
,
Colonel
Morgan
said
to
Standish
,
who
had
conducted
him
thither:"I
am
persuaded
this
is
not
the
last
interview
I
shall
have
with
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
Possibly
,
when
I
am
next
admitted
to
her
presence
,
she
may
treat
me
with
more
courtesy
than
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
""Before
<EOS>
that
,
I
trust
,
you
and
I
shall
meet
again
,
colonel
?
"
said
Standish

significantly

CHAPTER
VIIIHow
the
Intrenchments
were
madeBY
this
time
the
Parliamentarians
had
taken
up
their
quarters
at
various
points
round
the
castle
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Rigby
was
encamped
near
Newburgh
,
Colonel
Moore
on
the
road
to
Ormskirk
,
and
Colonel
Assheton
and
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
on
the
south
side
,
where
the
tents
could
be
descried
amongst
the
trees
.
<EOS>
The
besiegers
now
numbered
a
force
of
more
than
two
thousand
men
—
five
hundred
horse
,
and
fifteen
hundred
foot
—
quite
sufficient
,
it
was
thought
,
for
the
reduction
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
The
mansion
was
now
completely
invested
,
parties
of
men
being
posted
so
closely
together
that
all
communication
with
friends
was
cut
off
.
<EOS>
Already
the
lines
had
been
marked
out
by
the
engineers
,
and
the
pioneers
had
commenced
digging
the
trenches
.
<EOS>
They
were
assisted
by
several
hundred
sturdy
yeomen
and
hinds
,
all
of
them
being
Lord
Derby
's
tenants
or
servants
,
who
were
forced
by
threats
and
blows
to
do
work
that
was
most
distasteful
to
them
.
<EOS>
Some
of
these
poor
fellows
broke
away
and
ran
towards
the
castle
,
but
the
mounted
guard
galloped
after
them
and
brought
them
back
.
<EOS>
The
intrenchments
were
begun
at
night
at
the
distance
of
a
musket
-
shot
from
the
mansion
,
and
in
a
place
screened
by
the
rising
ground
from
the
ordnance
on
the
towers
,
and
the
pioneers
and
their
assistants
laboured
so
hard
that
before
dawn
considerable
progress
had
been
made
.
<EOS>
Concealment
was
then
no
longer
possible
,
and
fire
was
opened
upon
them
from
the
walls
of
the
castle
,
but
little
mischief
was
done
.
<EOS>
From
this
time
the
work
proceeded
rapidly
,
being
continued
night
and
day
without
intermission
.
<EOS>
A
deep
trench
,
sheltered
by
a
breastwork
of
earth
,
gradually
encircled
the
mansion
,
and
imprisoned
its
occupants
.
<EOS>
Constant
attacks
were
made
on
the
pioneers
,
but
no
real
interruption
was
effected
,
and
the
work
went
on
.
<EOS>
Posted
on
the
Eagle
Tower
,
the
countess
viewed
the
progress
of
this
work
with
ill
-
suppressed
rage
,
but
without
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
In
this
exalted
position
,
she
was
out
of
reach
of
the
enemy
's
guns
,
for
as
yet
no
large
piece
of
ordnance
had
been
directed
against
the
house
,
and
all
shot
had
been
fired
against
the
ramparts
.
<EOS>
No
serious
assault
,
however
,
had
been
made
;
nor
did
any
such
seem
intended
.
<EOS>
Evidently
,
the
design
of
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
and
the
other
Parliamentary
leaders
,
was
to
terrify
the
countess
into
submission
,
but
if
they
could
have
seen
her
on
the
Eagle
Tower
,
with
Major
Farrington
,
Archdeacon
Rutter
,
and
her
daughters
,
they
would
have
felt
she
would
not
be
easily
intimidated
.
<EOS>
Her
sole
feeling
was
that
of
anger
against
her
foes
,
and
an
almost
irrepressible
desire
to
attack
them
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
far
too
prudent
not
to
check
the
impulse
.
<EOS>
Not
unfrequently
,
was
Gertrude
Rosworm
present
,
and
if
her
sentiments
could
be
judged
by
her
flashing
eyes
,
she
shared
the
countess
's
indignation
,
and
longed
to
assail
the
besiegers
.
<EOS>
From
this
eminent
position
,
the
beholders
not
only
overlooked
the
rising
ground
on
the
further
side
of
the
moat
,
and
the
breastwork
of
the
trenches
,
but
could
distinguish
the
pioneers
and
their
assistants
at
work
.
<EOS>
They
saw
the
Parliamentary
commanders
riding
from
point
to
point
,
each
with
a
troop
of
horse
;
they
saw
the
numerous
parties
of
infantry
posted
around
;
and
they
likewise
descried
in
the
distance
the
different
encampments
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
While
they
were
gazing
at
this
picture
,
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
whom
they
easily
recognised
,
rode
round
the
intrenchments
,
followed
by
a
troop
of
horse
.
<EOS>
He
was
attended
by
Colonel
Browne
,
the
chief
engineer
,
and
Colonel
Morgan
,
and
halted
ever
and
anon
to
inspect
the
works
.
<EOS>
Several
shots
were
fired
at
him
,
and
though
he
escaped
,
two
of
his
men
were
killed
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
seem
in
the
slightest
degree
disturbed
by
these
occurrences
,
but
continued
his
inspection
quietly
,
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
<EOS>
The
countess
could
not
help
admiring
his
coolness
and
courage
,
and
she
was
still
watching
him
as
he
moved
on
,
when
Captain
Standish
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
"I
have
a
request
to
prefer
to
your
ladyship
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
that
Captain
Chisenhale
and
myself
may
be
permitted
to
sally
forth
on
the
enemy
tomorrow
morning
.
<EOS>
The
trenches
are
now
nearly
opposite
the
gateway
,
and
we
wish
to
give
the
pioneers
a
check
.
<EOS>
Captain
Chisenhale
will
take
with
him
a
hundred
musketeers
,
and
I
will
support
him
with
a
dozen
horse
.
<EOS>
Captain
Ogle
will
cover
our
retreat
.
"Before
<EOS>
making
a
reply
,
the
countess
glanced
at
Major
Farrington
who
was
standing
near
.
<EOS>
"'Tis
<EOS>
too
hazardous
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
If
twenty
or
thirty
musketeers
are
left
behind
in
the
trenches
the
loss
will
be
serious
to
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
we
shall
strike
a
heavy
blow
against
the
enemy
,
and
bring
back
arms
and
prisoners
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
yet
we
have
done
nothing
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
time
our
assailants
should
be
reminded
that
they
have
good
soldiers
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
""True
<EOS>
,
"
remarked
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
I
consent
to
the
attack
.
<EOS>
I
have
perfect
reliance
on
you
and
Captain
Chisenhale
.
<EOS>
""We
will
not
disappoint
your
ladyship
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
hope
you
are
not
too
sanguine
of
success
,
"
said
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
first
blow
is
half
the
battle
,
and
we
must
strike
it
,
"
rejoined
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
If
we
are
successful
—
as
I
believe
we
shall
be
—
the
enemy
will
be
disheartened
,
and
the
garrison
encouraged
.
<EOS>
It
will
gladden
Captain
Chisenhale
to
learn
that
I
have
obtained
your
ladyship
's
assent
to
the
sally
.
<EOS>
"CHAPTER
IXOf
the
Sortie
made
by
Captains
Chisenhale
and
StandishNEXT
morning
,
at
an
early
hour
,
as
previously
arranged
,
both
gates
of
the
castle
were
thrown
open
,
the
drawbridge
was
lowered
,
and
a
hundred
stalwart
musketeers
,
headed
by
Captain
Chisenhale
and
Lieutenant
Bretergh
,
suddenly
sallied
forth
.
<EOS>
They
were
quickly
followed
by
Captain
Standish
and
a
dozen
well-
mounted
and
well
-
armed
troopers
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
musketeers
and
troopers
had
crossed
the
drawbridge
,
which
they
did
with
great
expedition
,
it
was
instantly
raised
,
and
the
outer
gate
shut
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
every
precaution
had
been
taken
.
<EOS>
The
cannoniers
in
the
two
tall
towers
,
flanking
the
gate
-
house
,
were
standing
beside
their
guns
with
lighted
matches
in
their
hands
,
and
the
large
guard
-
chamber
above
the
gate
was
filled
with
musketeers
,
with
whom
were
Captain
Ogle
and
Lieutenant
Kay
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
whole
garrison
was
astir
,
and
there
were
numerous
lookers
-
on
at
the
sortie
,
though
being
concealed
in
the
towers
on
the
walls
,
they
could
not
be
descried
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Amongst
the
watchers
was
the
countess
herself
.
<EOS>
Already
she
had
ascended
the
Eagle
Tower
—
the
only
persons
with
her
being
Archdeacon
Rutter
and
Gertrude
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
She
had
seen
the
brave
band
of
musketeers
assemble
noiselessly
in
the
court
,
where
they
were
marshalled
by
Captain
Chisenhale
and
his
lieutenant
,
who
gave
them
their
final
orders
.
<EOS>
She
had
seen
Standish
come
forth
with
his
little
troop
of
horse
,
and
thought
how
well
both
the
men
and
their
leaders
looked
.
<EOS>
She
beheld
both
parties
pass
through
the
gates
,
and
for
a
moment
lost
sight
of
them
,
for
they
were
hidden
from
view
by
the
towers
.
<EOS>
Earnestly
—
most
earnestly
—
did
she
pray
for
their
success
.
<EOS>
Gertrude
looked
on
with
equal
interest
,
though
feelings
of
a
different
kind
agitated
her
breast
,
and
her
chief
anxiety
was
for
Standish
.
<EOS>
What
would
she
have
given
to
accompany
him
.
<EOS>
Archdeacon
Rutter
regarded
the
sortie
more
calmly
,
but
even
he
was
deeply
interested
.
<EOS>
When
next
the
watchers
beheld
the
musketeers
,
they
were
marching
swiftly
,
and
in
a
compact
body
towards
the
trenches
with
Captain
Chisenhale
at
their
head
,
and
Lieutenant
Kay
at
the
rear
.
<EOS>
Close
behind
rode
Standish
with
his
troop
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
were
they
discovered
by
the
sentinels
,
than
the
alarm
was
given
,
and
several
shots
were
fired
against
them
.
<EOS>
But
Chisenhale
would
not
allow
his
men
to
return
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Hurrying
forward
as
quickly
as
he
could
,
he
spread
out
his
force
,
and
quickly
climbing
the
breastwork
,
poured
a
murderous
fire
into
the
trenches
,
killing
a
great
number
of
the
besiegers
,
and
putting
the
rest
to
flight
.
<EOS>
The
fugitives
,
however
,
were
intercepted
by
Standish
,
who
had
crossed
with
his
men
at
a
point
not
yet
reached
by
the
pioneers
,
and
a
sharp
conflict
ensued
.
<EOS>
The
Parliamentarians
greatly
outnumbered
their
assailants
,
and
ought
to
have
made
a
stand
;
but
the
furious
onset
of
the
Royalists
proved
irresistible
.
<EOS>
With
loud
shouts
of
"
For
the
king
and
the
Earl
of
Derby
!
"
they
dashed
among
their
opponents
,
hewing
them
down
,
or
trampling
them
under
foot
.
<EOS>
Half
a
dozen
prisoners
were
taken
,
and
more
than
thrice
that
number
of
the
rebels
were
killed
—
but
not
a
single
Royalist
was
wounded
.
<EOS>
An
hour
had
not
elapsed
since
the
sortie
was
made
,
and
the
victorious
Royalists
were
returning
to
the
castle
with
a
great
number
of
arms
—
swords
,
pistols
,
musquetoons
,
bandoleers
,
and
match
-
tubes
—
a
drum
and
a
flag
—
together
with
the
prisoners
previously
mentioned
.
<EOS>
The
triumphant
issue
of
the
conflict
had
been
witnessed
with
great
exultation
from
the
towers
and
ramparts
of
the
mansion
,
and
loud
shouts
hailed
the
victors
on
their
return
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XOf
the
important
Prisoner
brought
in
by
StandishNO
one
was
more
elated
than
the
countess
,
though
she
veiled
her
satisfaction
under
a
calm
exterior
.
<EOS>
Quitting
the
Eagle
Tower
,
she
repaired
to
the
court
-
yard
with
her
daughters
and
Gertrude
,
and
arrived
there
just
as
Chisenhale
and
Standish
entered
the
gate
.
<EOS>
The
services
of
Captain
Ogle
,
who
was
waiting
to
cover
their
retreat
,
had
not
been
required
,
but
he
was
first
to
welcome
them
back
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
court
-
yard
was
thronged
.
<EOS>
Major
Farrington
and
all
the
officers
not
employed
in
the
affair
,
had
assembled
to
congratulate
their
friends
on
their
success
.
<EOS>
The
whole
place
resounded
with
shouts
.
<EOS>
Standish
and
Chisenhale
,
with
their
two
lieutenants
,
lost
no
time
in
presenting
themselves
to
the
countess
,
who
was
stationed
near
the
entrance
of
the
mansion
,
and
received
her
congratulations
and
hearty
thanks
.
<EOS>
"You
have
indeed
rendered
me
a
most
important
service
,
"
she
said
;
"
and
though
I
never
doubted
your
courage
and
zeal
,
I
scarcely
thought
it
possible
you
could
achieve
so
much
.
<EOS>
""Our
<EOS>
success
is
mainly
owing
to
the
bravery
of
our
followers
,
who
have
displayed
the
greatest
gallantry
,
"
said
Captain
Chisenhale
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
given
the
rebels
a
lesson
that
will
not
easily
be
forgotten
.
<EOS>
""I
am
proud
of
both
officers
and
men
—
and
with
good
reason
,
"
rejoined
the
countess
.
"
<EOS>
As
to
you
,
Captain
Standish
,
you
have
amply
redeemed
your
promise
,
and
have
brought
back
both
arms
and
prisoners
.
<EOS>
""I
have
brought
with
me
a
far
more
important
prisoner
than
I
ever
expected
to
capture
,
"
replied
Standish
.
"Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
is
he?""Yonder
,
with
the
others
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"They
are
all
accoutred
alike
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
no
one
who
appears
above
the
rank
of
a
common
soldier
.
<EOS>
""Yet
<EOS>
the
ablest
engineer
in
the
service
of
the
Parliament
is
amid
the
group
,
"
rejoined
Standish
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
ablest
engineer
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
countess
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
That
should
be
Colonel
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
have
me
understand
that
he
is
a
prisoner?"Then
calling
to
Gertrude
,
who
was
standing
near
,
she
said
to
her:"Look
at
those
men
.
<EOS>
Do
you
recognise
any
one
of
them?"Gertrude
remained
silent
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
your
father
there
?
"
pursued
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
Be
not
afraid
to
speak
.
<EOS>
No
harm
shall
befall
him
.
<EOS>
""After
<EOS>
that
promise
I
will
avow
the
truth
,
"
rejoined
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
there
,
madam
.
<EOS>
""Bring
<EOS>
Colonel
Rosworm
forward
<EOS>
that
I
may
question
him
,
"
said
the
countess
to
Standish
.
<EOS>
The
injunction
was
obeyed
,
and
in
another
moment
the
prisoner
stood
before
her
.
<EOS>
He
maintained
a
very
bold
demeanour
,
and
signed
to
his
daughter
,
who
would
have
rushed
forward
to
him
,
to
remain
quiet
.
<EOS>
"Do
I
behold
Colonel
Rosworm
?
"
asked
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
so
,
I
may
deem
myself
singularly
fortunate
.
<EOS>
""I
am
the
person
you
suppose
,
madam
,
"
replied
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
desire
for
concealment
.
<EOS>
I
am
certain
I
shall
be
honourably
treated
by
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
""You
may
rely
on
that
,
sir
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
bear
you
no
personal
enmity
.
<EOS>
Apart
from
your
hostility
to
the
king
,
I
esteem
your
character
,
and
I
have
the
highest
opinion
of
your
skill
as
an
engineer
.
<EOS>
But
how
is
it
that
I
see
you
in
this
disguise?""My
buff
coat
is
not
intended
as
a
disguise
,
madam
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
doffed
my
cuirass
and
other
accoutrements
,
in
order
that
I
might
work
more
freely
in
the
trenches
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
expect
to
appear
before
your
ladyship
,
or
I
would
have
come
more
suitably
attired
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
sooth
,
I
had
not
time
for
any
change
of
dress
.
<EOS>
When
your
musketeers
climbed
the
breastwork
,
and
fired
into
the
trench
,
I
cared
not
to
tarry
there
,
and
had
enough
to
do
to
save
my
life
by
flight
.
<EOS>
Having
no
arms
to
defend
myself
,
I
was
subsequently
taken
prisoner
by
Captain
Standish
,
but
he
did
not
demand
my
name
.
<EOS>
""I
knew
you
perfectly
well
,
colonel
,
and
deemed
the
inquiry
unnecessary
,
"
remarked
Standish
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
had
another
reason
for
the
course
I
pursued
,
"
he
added
,
turning
to
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
I
wished
to
give
your
ladyship
an
agreeable
surprise
,
and
I
think
I
have
succeeded
in
my
aim
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
,
"
she
observed
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
you
,
Colonel
Rosworm
,
I
am
really
glad
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
a
prisoner
on
parole
,
and
while
you
are
detained
here
you
shall
not
have
to
complain
of
harsh
treatment
.
<EOS>
Till
you
are
ransomed
,
or
exchanged
as
a
hostage
of
war
,
you
shall
have
as
much
liberty
as
you
can
reasonably
desire
,
and
enjoy
the
society
of
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
""I
thank
your
ladyship
for
your
great
consideration
,
"
replied
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
readily
give
you
my
word
that
I
will
not
attempt
to
escape
.
<EOS>
""Enough
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
Of
necessity
,
you
must
submit
to
a
certain
restraint
—
but
it
shall
not
be
much
.
<EOS>
"Any
<EOS>
uneasiness
that
Gertrude
might
have
felt
was
now
completely
dispelled
.
<EOS>
Coming
forward
she
said
to
the
countess:"Am
<EOS>
I
at
liberty
to
speak
to
my
father
,
madam?""Assuredly
,
"
replied
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
wish
that
you
should
be
together
as
much
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
Find
a
lodging
for
him
forthwith
.
<EOS>
I
commit
him
to
your
charge
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
another
minute
Gertrude
and
Rosworm
had
disappeared
,
but
not
till
both
had
expressed
their
gratitude
.
<EOS>
Most
of
those
who
witnessed
this
scene
thought
the
countess
showed
far
too
much
consideration
to
the
German
engineer
;
but
Major
Farrington
,
Archdeacon
Rutter
,
and
Standish
regarded
her
conduct
differently
,
and
thought
it
exceedingly
judicious
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
captives
were
not
quite
so
fortunate
.
<EOS>
The
countess
did
not
deign
to
notice
them
.
<EOS>
Taken
to
the
gate
-
house
,
they
were
confined
in
the
prison
under
the
guard
-
room
,
there
to
remain
till
<EOS>
the
chances
of
war
might
effect
their
liberation
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
supposed
that
Lady
Derby
neglected
to
return
thanks
to
Heaven
for
the
success
vouchsafed
her
.
<EOS>
From
the
courtyard
she
proceeded
to
the
chapel
,
whither
all
the
officers
and
most
of
the
men
engaged
in
the
sortie
,
followed
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
service
to
be
remembered
,
since
there
was
one
person
present
on
the
occasion
,
who
could
not
have
been
looked
for
.
<EOS>
This
was
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
Probably
Gertrude
induced
him
to
attend
;
but
be
that
as
it
may
,
the
countess
was
well
pleased
to
behold
him
in
the
chapel
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
XIHow
the
Countess
received
a
Visit
from
several
Royalist
GentlemenNEXT
day
,
being
Sunday
<EOS>
,
there
was
a
suspension
of
hostilities
,
and
no
firing
took
place
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
discovered
whether
the
enemy
were
at
work
in
the
trenches
,
but
it
seemed
not
,
and
it
was
certain
the
different
parties
of
men
collected
near
the
tents
were
singing
psalms
,
or
listening
to
the
lengthy
discourses
of
their
preachers
,
for
their
voices
could
be
heard
by
the
musketeers
on
the
towers
and
gate
-
house
,
even
at
that
distance
.
<EOS>
If
the
besiegers
were
engaged
in
their
devotions
so
were
the
besieged
.
<EOS>
Half
the
garrison
attended
divine
service
in
the
chapel
at
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
,
and
the
remainder
later
on
,
when
a
thanksgiving
sermon
was
preached
by
Archdeacon
Rutter
.
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
,
an
incident
occurred
for
which
the
countess
was
quite
unprepared
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
the
great
hall
with
her
daughters
and
some
other
persons
,
when
Major
Farrington
came
to
inform
her
that
some
half
-
dozen
Royalist
gentlemen
,
with
whom
she
was
well
acquainted
,
had
just
arrived
at
the
castle
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
able
to
credit
the
statement
,
she
inquired
who
they
were
,
and
how
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
permitted
by
the
enemy
to
approach
the
gate
.
<EOS>
"They
have
a
safeguard
from
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
who
is
desirous
they
should
have
an
interview
with
your
ladyship
,
"
replied
Major
Farrington
;
"
as
he
hopes
they
may
induce
you
to
surrender
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
""Methought
<EOS>
you
said
they
are
Royalist
gentlemen
with
whom
I
am
well
acquainted
,
"
remarked
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
They
can
know
little
of
me
,
if
they
entertain
any
such
notion
.
<EOS>
Who
are
they?""The
principal
person
among
them
is
Sir
Thomas
Prestwich
,
"
replied
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"
With
him
are
Sir
Edward
Litten
,
Sir
John
Getherick
,
Mr.
Gillibrand
,
Mr.
Fleetwood
,
and
Mr.
Leigh
—
all
adherents
of
the
noble
lord
,
your
husband
,
and
devoted
to
the
royal
cause
.
<EOS>
""Bring
them
to
me
<EOS>
,
I
pray
you
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
them
.
<EOS>
"Shortly
<EOS>
afterwards
the
gentlemen
in
question
were
ceremoniously
ushered
into
the
hall
,
and
presented
to
her
ladyship
by
Major
Farrington
,
who
received
them
very
courteously
.
<EOS>
"I
am
glad
to
see
you
,
gentlemen
,
"
she
said
,
"
though
I
marvel
you
have
been
able
to
obtain
admittance
to
me
.
<EOS>
""We
could
not
have
done
so
,
but
for
the
consideration
shown
us
by
General
Fairfax
,
"
replied
Sir
Thomas
Prestwich
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
a
petition
to
your
ladyship
,
signed
by
many
friends
and
adherents
of
your
noble
husband
,
praying
you
to
make
terms
with
your
enemies
,
who
are
disposed
to
treat
you
honourably
and
fairly
,
and
not
continue
a
useless
resistance
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
thank
you
,
gentlemen
,
for
the
interest
you
take
in
me
<EOS>
,
"
she
replied
;
"
but
you
would
have
done
better
to
petition
those
rebellious
leaders
who
have
plundered
and
spoiled
the
county
to
cease
their
wicked
actions
,
rather
than
come
to
me
,
who
seek
to
attack
no
one
,
but
desire
only
to
defend
my
children
and
my
mansion
during
my
lord
's
enforced
absence
.
<EOS>
You
profess
yourselves
loyal
servants
of
the
king
,
and
I
do
not
doubt
your
zeal
,
but
see
you
not
that
you
are
taking
part
with
his
enemies
in
bringing
this
petition
to
me
?
<EOS>
It
is
the
aim
of
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
and
those
with
him
to
induce
me
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
But
they
will
fail
.
<EOS>
No
representations
,
either
of
friend
or
foe
,
shall
induce
me
to
take
such
an
unworthy
course
.
<EOS>
I
will
make
no
terms
with
declared
rebels
and
traitors
,
for
those
who
are
faithless
to
their
sovereign
are
not
likely
to
be
true
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
shall
take
no
message
back
from
me
to
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
save
one
of
defiance
.
<EOS>
With
Heaven
's
help
I
will
hold
my
house
against
him
and
all
my
enemies
,
and
he
will
never
induce
me
to
surrender
,
either
by
promises
that
I
disbelieve
,
or
threats
that
I
despise
.
<EOS>
Take
back
this
answer
from
me
,
I
pray
you
,
Sir
Thomas
,
to
General
Fairfax
,
and
say
it
is
final
.
<EOS>
I
will
receive
no
more
messages
from
him
—
nor
would
I
have
received
this
,
had
it
not
been
brought
by
you
.
<EOS>
""We
applaud
your
resolution
,
madam
,
"
said
Sir
Thomas
Prestwich
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
entirely
changed
our
sentiments
.
<EOS>
We
were
led
to
believe
it
would
be
impossible
for
you
to
hold
out
against
the
force
brought
against
you
,
but
we
now
think
otherwise
.
<EOS>
""Have
<EOS>
you
not
heard
of
the
success
of
our
sortie
yesterday
,
Sir
Thomas
?
"
asked
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
made
a
most
important
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Rosworm
is
now
in
our
hands
.
<EOS>
""No
mention
was
made
to
us
of
the
circumstance
,
"
replied
Prestwich
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
capture
of
Rosworm
is
indeed
important
.
<EOS>
""He
is
here
,
"
remarked
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"
Look
towards
the
bottom
of
the
hall
,
and
you
will
behold
him
.
<EOS>
You
can
now
tell
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
that
you
have
seen
him
here
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
not
fail
to
do
so
,
"
replied
Prestwich
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
now
take
our
leave
of
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
you
must
not
depart
thus
,
gentlemen
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Stay
and
dine
with
me
,
I
pray
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
then
be
able
to
tell
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
that
we
do
not
lack
provisions
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
party
required
little
pressing
,
but
willingly
consented
to
stay
.
<EOS>
Orders
having
been
sent
to
the
steward
by
Major
Farrington
,
an
abundant
repast
was
speedily
served
,
to
which
more
than
fifty
persons
,
including
the
chaplains
and
officers
,
sat
down
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Prestwich
and
his
companions
were
placed
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
near
the
countess
,
and
only
separated
from
them
by
Doctor
Brideoake
was
Colonel
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
In
taking
leave
of
her
ladyship
,
her
visitors
bade
her
be
of
good
cheer
,
and
as
they
passed
through
the
gate
they
called
out

"CHAPTER
<EOS>
XIIHow
Rosworm
was
taken
by
Standish
to
the
Guard
-
room
in
the
Gate
-
houseCOLONEL
ROSWORM
seemed
quite
reconciled
to
his
captivity
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
there
was
nothing
irksome
about
it
,
since
he
was
treated
rather
as
a
guest
than
as
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
The
countess
directed
Standish
to
show
him
every
attention
,
and
take
him
where
<EOS>
he
would
,
except
upon
the
Eagle
Tower
and
ramparts
.
<EOS>
Rosworm
had
thus
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
men
,
and
was
greatly
struck
by
their
appearance
.
<EOS>
Almost
all
of
them
were
stalwart
fellows
with
a
very
resolute
expression
of
countenance
,
and
though
many
of
them
were
not
equipped
as
soldiers
,
but
looked
like
what
they
were
—
huntsmen
,
keepers
,
and
fowlers
—
he
could
not
doubt
they
were
excellent
marksmen
,
and
admirably
adapted
for
the
service
on
which
they
were
employed
.
<EOS>
"Those
<EOS>
men
have
been
most
judiciously
chosen
,
"
he
remarked
to
Standish
;
"
and
now
I
see
them
and
their
long
fowling
-
pieces
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
wonder
that
so
many
of
our
pioneers
have
been
shot
.
<EOS>
""I
will
show
you
some
of
our
best
marksmen
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
just
finished
their
watch
,
and
have
gone
into
the
guard
-
room
.
<EOS>
We
shall
find
them
there
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
took
Rosworm
to
the
gatehouse
,
near
which
half
a
dozen
musketeers
were
posted
,
and
entering
a
small
door
in
one
of
the
towers
,
mounted
a
short
circular
staircase
that
brought
them
to
the
guard
-
room
.
<EOS>
A
large
square
chamber
,
with
strong
stone
walls
,
and
a
staircase
on
either
side
that
afforded
instant
communication
with
the
leads
above
on
which
two
pieces
of
ordnance
were
placed
.
<EOS>
Narrow
loopholes
commanded
the
drawbridge
,
and
there
was
a
mullioned
window
looking
towards
the
outer
court
.
<EOS>
Within
the
chamber
were
machines
for
raising
and
lowering
the
two
portcullises
.
<EOS>
Seated
on
benches
at
a
stout
oak
table
,
and
making
a
hearty
meal
from
a
cold
meat
pasty
were
a
dozen
stalwart
men
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
they
applied
to
a
large
jug
of
beer
placed
in
the
centre
of
the
table
,
but
these
interruptions
were
not
frequent
.
<EOS>
All
these
individuals
wore
buff
coats
,
and
belts
from
which
hung
powder-
flasks
and
pouches
containing
bullets
;
while
reared
against
the
walls
were
long
fowling
-
pieces
and
screwed
guns
evidently
belonging
to
them
.
<EOS>
So
occupied
were
the
hungry
marksmen
with
their
meal
,
that
they
did
not
notice
the
entrance
of
Standish
and
his
companion
;
and
besides
,
the
intruders
were
partly
hidden
by
the
portcullis
which
had
been
raised
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
hast
thou
done
,
Tom
Thornhaugh
?
<EOS>
"
asked
a
man
whose
back
was
towards
them
,
of
a
brawny
yeoman
who
sat
opposite
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
thee
fire
twice
,
and
I
suppose
neither
shot
<EOS>
missed?""Thou
art
right
,
Dick
Bold
,
"
replied
Thornhaugh
.
<EOS>
"
It
grieves
me
to
kill
those
poor
country
folk
who
are
forced
in
the
trenches
—
but
I
could
n't
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
get
a
shot
at
some
of
their
officers
—
but
they
always
contrive
to
keep
out
of
reach
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
always
,
"
rejoined
Dick
Bold
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
lodged
a
bullet
in
Captain
Bootle
's
brain
this
morning
,
had
he
not
worn
a
combed
headpiece
.
<EOS>
""I
have
been
on
the
look
out
for
Colonel
Rigby
,
"
remarked
another
,
whose
name
appeared
to
be
Launce
Walker
;
"
but
he
was
too
cautious
to
come
near
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
marry
,
Rigby
would
have
been
a
feather
in
thy
cap
,
Launce
,
"
observed
Dick
Bold
.
<EOS>
"
All
the
garrison
would
have
rejoiced
at
his
death
,
but
thou
say'st
truly
—
he
wo
n't
expose
himself
to
danger
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
we
ought
to
give
the
devil
himself
his
due
,
"
observed
another
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
"
Rigby
does
n't
want
courage
.
<EOS>
""He
does
n't
want
cunning
and
malice
,
"
said
Dick
Bold
.
<EOS>
"
I
verily
believe
it
is
he
who
has
caused
this
place
to
be
besieged
.
<EOS>
He
hates
our
good
lord
because
he
trailed
his
friend
Captain
Birch
under
a
hay
-
cart
at
Manchester
.
<EOS>
That
was
a
good
jest
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
"
laughed
the
whole
company
.
<EOS>
"I
wish
Captain
Standish
would
make
Rigby
a
prisoner
in
his
next
sally
,
"
remarked
Thornhaugh
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
have
got
a
prisoner
worth
a
dozen
of
Rigby
,
"
said
Dick
Bold
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
mean
Colonel
Rosworm
,
"
remarked
Launce
Walker
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
"
rejoined
Bold
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
would
only
join
us
,
we
should
have
nothing
to
fear
.
<EOS>
""We
have
nothing
to
fear
as
it
is
,
"
said
Launce
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
no
doubt
Rosworm
could
give
us
great
help
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
juncture
the
person
referred
to
made
a
movement
to
depart
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
us
go
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
played
the
listéner
too
long
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
Standish
detained
him
,
and
drew
him
forward
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
men
became
aware
of
Rosworm
's
presence
they
all
arose
.
<EOS>
"I
have
heard
what
you
have
just
said
,
"
Rosworm
remarked
;
"
and
I
thank
you
for
the
good
opinion
you
seem
to
entertain
of
me
.
<EOS>
""Join
<EOS>
us
,
colonel
!
<EOS>
join
us
!
"
<EOS>
they
cried
with
one
voice
.
<EOS>
"No
,
I
can
not
do
that
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
not
fight
against
you
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
""You
must
not
have
the
opportunity
of
doing
so
,
colonel
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
Now
you
are
here
,
we
must
keep
you
with
us
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
that
we
must
,
"
cried
the
men
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
the
countess
has
promised
to
exchange
me
,
"
rejoined
Rosworm
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
well
know
she
will
keep
her
word
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
if
her
ladyship
has
made
you
that
promise
no
more
need
be
said
.
<EOS>
But
you
may
change
your
mind
,
colonel
,
and
stay
.
<EOS>
""I
do
n't
think
that
likely
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
we
must
try
and
prevent
your
departure
,
"
cried
the
men
.
<EOS>
"I
feel
no
apprehension
on
that
score
,
"
laughed
Rosworm
,
as
he
quitted
the
guard
-
room
with
Standish
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XIIIIn
what
Manner
a
Letter
was
sent
to
Colonel
RoswormAS
<EOS>
they
returned
through
the
court
,
they
saw
the
countess
and
her
daughters
.
<EOS>
She
was
attended
by
Major
Farrington
,
Archdeacon
Rutter
,
and
one
or
two
of
the
officers
.
<EOS>
"I
must
now
leave
you
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
is
about
to
ascend
the
Eagle
Tower
,
and
I
must
attend
her
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
should
caution
her
not
to
expose
herself
too
much
,
"
said
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
At
present
we
have
no
cannon
that
can
reach
the
summit
of
that
tower
—
but
some
bombards
and
a
culverin
are
expected
.
<EOS>
""I
will
tell
her
what
you
say
,
"
rejoined
Standish
.
<EOS>
And
he
proceeded
towards
the
entrance
of
the
Eagle
Tower
.
<EOS>
Rosworm
was
still
in
the
outer
court
,
pacing
to
and
fro
,
and
thinking
over
what
had
just
occurred
,
when
a
soldier
halted
beside
him
,
and
holding
out
his
hand
as
he
spoke
,
said
,
in
a
significant
tone:"I
<EOS>
have
just
picked
up
this
ball
,
colonel
.
<EOS>
Have
you
dropped
it?"Thus
addressed
,
Rosworm
looked
at
the
man
and
saw
that
he
held
between
his
fingers
and
thumb
,
a
wax
ball
about
the
size
of
a
musket
bullet
.
<EOS>
"Give
<EOS>
it
me
,
"
he
said
,
instantly
comprehending
what
was
meant
.
<EOS>
The
man
complied
,
and
without
waiting
to
be
thanked
,
marched
on
.
<EOS>
The
incident
did
not
occupy
more
than
a
minute
,
so
that
if
noticed
by
the
musketeers
on
the
ramparts
,
it
was
not
likely
to
excite
suspicion
.
<EOS>
Rosworm
continued
his
promenade
for
a
short
time
longer
,
and
then
repairing
to
his
lodging
,
which
was
in
an
outbuilding
attached
to
the
mansion
,
he
broke
the
ball
,
and
found
—
as
he
expected
—
that
it
contained
a
letter
,
written
on
very
thin
paper
.
<EOS>
He
fancied
the
handwriting
<EOS>
was
that
of
Captain
Bootle
,
but
as
the
words
were
traced
in
pencil
,
he
did
not
feel
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
The
message
was
very
brief
,
and
ran
thus:"Means
will
be
found
to
effect
your
escape
.
<EOS>
Be
prepared
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
friend
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
offer
is
useless
,
"
mentally
ejaculated
Rosworm
,
after
he
had
read
the
missive
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
promised
the
countess
not
to
attempt
flight
,
and
I
can
not
break
my
word
.
"While
<EOS>
he
was
revolving
the
matter
,
a
tap
was
heard
at
the
door
,
and
Gertrude
entered
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
find
your
captivity
irksome
,
dear
father
?
<EOS>
"
she
inquired
.
<EOS>
"
You
look
melancholy
.
<EOS>
""Were
<EOS>
I
not
bound
by
my
word
,
I
need
not
remain
here
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Means
of
escape
have
just
been
offered
me
.
<EOS>
Read
that
letter
.
"After
<EOS>
casting
her
eyes
over
it
,
Gertrude
said:"I
will
not
ask
how
this
letter
was
brought
you
,
father
;
"
but
I
am
sorry
to
find
we
have
traitors
in
the
castle
.
<EOS>
""Those
<EOS>
traitors
are
my
friends
,
"
remarked
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
word
must
be
said
of
this
matter
to
the
countess
.
<EOS>
""She
ought
to
know
it
,
father
,
"
rejoined
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"She
<EOS>
must
not
,
child
,
"
said
Rosworm
,
sternly
,
and
authoritatively
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
sufficient
that
I
shall
not
avail
myself
of
the
offer
made
me
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
by
the
same
means
which
would
be
employed
for
your
flight
a
secret
communication
may
be
kept
up
with
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
""That
can
not
be
helped
,
"
said
her
father
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
not
feel
that
I
shall
be
doing
my
duty
to
the
countess
by
keeping
silence
,
father
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
duty
is
to
me
,
child
.
<EOS>
I
lay
my
commands
upon
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
dare
to
disobey
them
.
<EOS>
"Well
<EOS>
knowing
that
remonstrance
would
be
useless
,
Gertrude
did
not
attempt
it
,
but
she
said:"Would
it
were
possible
,
father
,
that
you
could
aid
this
noble
lady
to
defend
her
mansion
against
the
rebels!"Rosworm
shook
his
head
,
but
his
looks
showed
that
her
entreaties
had
produced
some
impression
.
<EOS>
Seeing
this
,
she
flung
herself
on
her
knees
before
him
,
and
exclaimed:"I
will
not
rise
till
you
grant
my
prayer
!
<EOS>
Aid
her
,
I
implore
you
,
dear
father
!
<EOS>
aid
her!""I
can
not
,
daughter
,
"
replied
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
My
sympathies
are
with
her
,
but
I
must
not
—
cannot
aid
her
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
"
he
added
,
after
a
pause
,
"
I
do
not
think
she
needs
assistance
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
give
me
hopes
,
"
she
cried
,
rising
to
her
feet
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
of
opinion
that
the
countess
will
triumph?""From
what
I
have
seen
since
I
came
here
<EOS>
I
am
convinced
she
can
hold
out
till
the
Earl
of
Derby
<EOS>
comes
to
her
deliverance
.
<EOS>
""May
<EOS>
I
tell
her
you
have
said
so
?
<EOS>
It
will
give
her
hopes
.
<EOS>
""As
<EOS>
you
please
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
really
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
"Just
<EOS>
then
,
the
door
was
opened
,
and
Standish
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
"I
bring
you
good
news
,
Colonel
Rosworm
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
no
longer
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
suppose
for
a
moment
that
you
are
jesting
with
me
,
Captain
Standish
,
"
rejoined
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
scarcely
able
to
credit
the
intelligence
.
<EOS>
""What
has
happened
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Gertrude
,
equally
astonished
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
father
has
been
ransomed
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
letter
has
just
been
brought
from
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
offering
a
large
sum
as
a
ransom
for
Colonel
Rosworm
,
and
the
countess
has
accepted
the
offer
.
<EOS>
You
are
therefore
free
,
and
can
return
with
the
messenger
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
has
sent
me
to
convey
the
intelligence
to
you
,
well
knowing
the
errand
would
be
agreeable
to
me
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
thank
you
heartily
,
Captain
Standish
,
"
rejoined
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
intelligence
is
wholly
unexpected
on
my
part
,
for
I
need
scarcely
say
I
have
had
no
communication
with
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
and
I
did
not
think
he
valued
my
services
so
highly
as
to
offer
a
ransom
for
my
liberation
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
will
depart
at
once
,
father
,
"
cried
Gertrude
,
"
and
again
join
the
ranks
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
not
depart
without
taking
leave
of
the
countess
,
"
rejoined
Rosworm
,
"
and
thanking
her
for
the
generous
treatment
I
have
experienced
.
<EOS>
""Her
<EOS>
ladyship
has
descended
from
the
Eagle
Tower
,
and
is
now
on
the
parade
,
"
said
Standish
"
I
will
conduct
you
to
her
.
<EOS>
"Having
<EOS>
no
preparations
to
make
for
his
departure
<EOS>
,
Rosworm
at
once
accompanied
Standish
to
the
outer
court
,
where
they
found
the
countess
and
her
usual
attendants
.
<EOS>
At
some
little
distance
stood
the
Parliamentary
officer
who
had
brought
the
message
from
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"Colonel
<EOS>
Rosworm
is
come
to
take
leave
of
your
ladyship
,
"
said
Standish
,
leading
the
somewhile
prisoner
forward
.
<EOS>
Rosworm
bowed
deeply
,
and
in
accents
that
bespoke
his
sincerity
,
thanked
the
countess
for
the
great
kindness
she
had
shown
him
.
<EOS>
"Rarely
<EOS>
has
a
prisoner
of
war
been
treated
as
I
have
been
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
I
shall
ever
entertain
a
grateful
sense
of
your
ladyship
's
kindness
.
<EOS>
But
I
fear
I
shall
never
be
able
to
requite
it
.
<EOS>
May
I
ask
if
you
have
made
any
stipulations
in
regard
to
my
release?""None
<EOS>
whatever
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
free
to
act
as
you
think
proper
.
<EOS>
Had
I
made
any
bargain
I
would
have
consulted
you
.
<EOS>
""Such
<EOS>
noble
conduct
is
worthy
of
you
,
madam
,
"
said
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
You
set
an
example
to
your
enemies
which
they
will
do
well
to
follow
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
another
profound
salutation
<EOS>
,
he
turned
to
depart
.
<EOS>
After
bidding
adieu
to
his
daughter
,
he
joined
the
officer
,
who
was
waiting
for
him
,
and
they
were
conducted
by
Standish
and
a
guard
to
the
gate
.
<EOS>
On
the
way
hither
,
they
encountered
Captain
Chisenhale
and
Captain
Ogle
.
<EOS>
Both
of
them
bowed
to
him
and
the
former
remarked:"We
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
here
again
,
colonel
,
in
the
same
character
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
another
minute
Rosworm
had
passed
through
the
wicket
at
the
side
of
the
gate
,
crossed
the
drawbridge
,
and
was
riding
with
the
messenger
and
a
sergeant
who
had
accompanied
him
on
his
errand
towards
the
camp
.
<EOS>
On
the
way
thither
,
he
looked
back
once
or
twice
at
the
beleaguered
mansion
,
but
made
no
remark
,
nor
did
he
answer
any
questions
put
to
him
by
his
companion
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XIVA
Traitor
<EOS>
punishedA
<EOS>
MIST
rendered
it
very
dark
that
night
,
and
one
of
the
sentinels
stationed
on
the
ramparts
at
the
back
of
the
castle
,
fancying
he
heard
some
one
swimming
across
the
moat
,
fired
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
,
but
missed
his
aim
owing
to
the
obscurity
.
<EOS>
It
was
subsequently
discovered
that
one
of
the
soldiers
—
the
same
who
had
delivered
the
secret
letter
to
Rosworm
—
had
got
out
at
the
postern
gate
,
and
favoured
by
the
darkness
had
effected
his
escape
in
the
manner
described
.
<EOS>
This
circumstance
being
mentioned
to
Standish
,
caused
him
some
uneasiness
,
for
though
he
could
not
account
for
the
man
's
flight
at
that
juncture
<EOS>
,
he
felt
certain
he
was
a
traitor
.
<EOS>
After
some
discussion
with
Captain
Chisenhale
and
Lieutenant
Bretergh
,
these
two
officers
resolved
to
anticipate
any
attack
that
might
be
made
by
the
enemy
,
and
give
them
another
alarm
in
the
trenches
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
about
an
hour
later
accompanied
by
thirty
musketeers
,
they
proceeded
to
the
postern
tower
,
part
of
which
stood
on
the
further
side
of
the
moat
,
and
beyond
the
palisades
,
and
issuing
forth
from
a
small
door
strongly
cased
with
iron
,
marched
swiftly
and
silently
towards
the
trenches
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
not
so
successful
as
on
the
previous
occasion
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
were
more
on
the
alert
,
and
had
placed
sentinels
on
the
breastwork
.
<EOS>
Though
these
men
could
not
distinguish
the
sallying
party
,
they
were
warned
of
their
approach
by
the
lighted
matches
carried
by
the
musketeers
,
and
gave
the
alarm
;
whereupon
their
comrades
instantly
quitted
the
trenches
,
and
speeded
towards
an
adjoining
wood
;
whither
they
were
chased
by
Chisenhale
and
his
company
.
<EOS>
Sheltered
by
the
trees
,
the
fugitives
sustained
little
loss
,
and
only
three
or
four
were
killed
.
<EOS>
One
prisoner
was
likewise
made
,
and
this
proved
to
be
Ralph
Thorold
,
the
man
who
had
just
escaped
from
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
When
brought
back
to
the
mansion
,
and
interrogated
by
Major
Farrington
,
Thorold
confessed
that
he
had
been
in
communication
with
Captain
Bootle
,
but
refused
to
declare
how
the
letters
had
been
brought
to
him
.
<EOS>
Adjudged
to
die
the
death
of
a
traitor
,
he
was
hanged
at
an
early
hour
next
morning
from
the
battlements
of
the
postern
tower
in
full
view
of
the
trenches
.

CHAPTER
XVHow
a
Letter
sent
by
the
Earl
of
Derby
to
Fairfax
was
brought
by
Captain
Ashhurst
to
the
CountessNEXT
morning
<EOS>
,
Captain
Ashhurst
rode
with
a
flag
of
truce
to
the
gates
of
the
castle
,
and
sought
an
interview
of
the
countess
;
stating
that
he
had
an
important
message
to
deliver
to
her
from
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
Though
wearied
out
with
propositions
ending
in
nothing
,
her
ladyship
consented
to
receive
him
,
and
the
messenger
was
conducted
by
Standish
to
the
presence-
chamber
,
where
he
found
her
with
Major
Farrington
and
Archdeacon
Rutter
.
<EOS>
Captain
Ashhurst
's
manner
was
extremely
respectful
,
and
offered
a
marked
contrast
to
the
insolent
deportment
that
generally
characterised
a
Parliamentary
officer
.
<EOS>
Bowing
to
the
countess
,
he
informed
her
that
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
had
just
received
a
despatch
from
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
and
had
sent
it
for
her
perusal
.
<EOS>
""It
is
here
,
madam
,
"
he
continued
,
handing
it
to
her
,
"
and
it
is
the
general
's
opinion
that
this
letter
will
have
more
weight
with
you
than
any
message
he
could
send
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
me
see
it
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ay
,
truly
,
it
is
from
my
lord
,
and
sent
from
Castle
<EOS>
Rushen,"And
<EOS>
she
could
not
help
pressing
her
lips
to
the
signature
.
<EOS>
Seeing
her
so
much
moved
,
Captain
Ashhurst
augured
well
for
the
success
of
his
mission
.
<EOS>
But
as
she
read
the
letter
,
her
aspect
entirely
changed
,
and
she
looked
stern
and
resolved
.
<EOS>
After
showing
the
letter
to
her
advisers
,
who
returned
it
without
a
word
,
she
said:"His
lordship
writes
in
error
.
<EOS>
Unaware
of
the
propositions
already
made
by
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
and
of
my
rejection
of
them
,
he
desires
an
honourable
and
free
passage
for
myself
and
my
children
,
being
unwilling
to
expose
us
to
the
danger
and
suffering
of
a
lengthened
siege
.
<EOS>
""Exactly
<EOS>
so
,
madam
,
"
replied
Captain
Ashhurst
;
"
and
I
am
instructed
by
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
to
say
that
if
your
ladyship
wills
it
,
he
will
readily
grant
his
lordship
's
request
.
<EOS>
""Tell
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
<EOS>
I
am
much
beholden
to
him
for
his
consideration
in
referring
the
matter
to
me
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
beg
that
he
will
henceforth
treat
with
my
lord
.
<EOS>
When
I
receive
my
husband
's
express
commands
I
will
obey
them
,
be
they
what
they
may
.
<EOS>
But
till
I
am
assured
that
his
lordship
desires
me
to
yield
up
this
castle
,
I
will
neither
quit
it
,
nor
make
any
terms
for
its
surrender
.
<EOS>
"Both
<EOS>
Major
Farrington
and
Doctor
Rutter
looked
at
her
approvingly
,
but
neither
spoke
.
<EOS>
"Pardon
<EOS>
me
,
madam
,
"
said
Captain
Ashhurst
,
"
if
I
venture
to
observe
that
the
Earl
of
Derby
's
wishes
are
plainly
conveyed
in
this
letter
.
<EOS>
Had
not
his
lordship
felt
that
you
ought
to
surrender
,
he
would
not
have
written
in
these
terms
to
the
general
.
<EOS>
For
that
reason
Sir
Thomas
has
sent
you
the
letter
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
thank
him
again
for
his
courtesy
,
and
for
choosing
you
as
his
messenger
,
"
replied
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
Take
back
the
letter
to
your
general
,
and
tell
him
that
till
I
learn
my
lord
's
pleasure
I
abide
where
I
am
,
and
wait
the
event
in
full
confidence
of
Heaven
's
support
.
<EOS>
"Seeing
<EOS>
that
the
audience
was
at
an
end
,
Ashhurst
retired
,
and
was
conducted
to
the
gate
by
Standish
.
<EOS>
"Yours
<EOS>
is
a
noble
lady
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
it
is
impossible
not
to
sympathise
with
her
.
<EOS>
For
her
own
sake
I
wish
she
would
surrender
.
<EOS>
""She
has
nothing
to
fear
,
"
rejoined
Standish
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
XVIHow
two
Pieces
of
Ordnance
were
seized
by
StandishON
that
night
,
despite
a
constant
fire
from
the
postern
tower
,
the
besiegers
contrived
to
bring
up
a
demi
-
cannon
and
a
culverin
,
and
placed
them
on
the
summit
of
the
rising
ground
beyond
the
moat
.
<EOS>
Next
morning
the
cannoniers
on
the
opposite
towers
tried
ineffectually
to
dislodge
these
pieces
of
ordnance
.
<EOS>
Several
shots
were
fired
from
the
newly-
erected
battery
against
the
walls
of
the
mansion
,
but
without
doing
any
material
damage
.
<EOS>
Afterwards
a
higher
range
was
taken
.
<EOS>
Two
or
three
battlements
were
broken
,
and
a
musketeer
who
imprudently
showed
himself
on
the
ramparts
was
killed
.
<EOS>
This
was
regarded
as
a
great
achievement
by
the
enemy
,
who
raised
a
loud
shout
;
but
their
exultation
was
soon
over
,
for
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
two
of
the
cannoniers
were
killed
.
<EOS>
Another
sortie
was
made
that
night
by
Standish
and
Chisenhale
,
accompanied
by
fifty
musketeers
—
their
object
being
to
dismount
the
two
pieces
of
cannon
that
had
given
the
garrison
so
much
trouble
throughout
the
day
.
<EOS>
After
a
sharp
conflict
with
the
guard
,
during
which
Captain
Chisenhale
was
slightly
wounded
,
they
succeeded
in
accomplishing
their
design
.
<EOS>
Their
triumph
would
have
been
complete
,
if
they
could
have
brought
the
two
guns
away
with
them
,
but
this
was
impracticable
.
<EOS>
The
besiegers
now
began
to
show
more
activity
and
determination
than
they
had
hitherto
displayed
.
<EOS>
Provoked
at
the
destruction
of
their
little
battery
,
they
brought
up
a
basilisk
and
a
saker
,
two
pieces
of
ordnance
of
smaller
calibre
than
a
culverin
,
and
planted
them
against
the
gate
-
towers
.
<EOS>
A
misdirected
shot
from
the
basilisk
entered
the
wicket
,
and
killed
one
of
the
guard
,
but
did
not
find
its
way
to
the
court
.
<EOS>
Immediately
afterwards
the
gate
was
thrown
open
,
and
the
drawbridge
lowered
,
and
a
party
of
horsemen
headed
by
Standish
dashed
out
provided
with
ropes
.
<EOS>
Seizing
the
two
pieces
of
ordnance
,
they
dragged
them
into
the
court
,
their
own
retreat
being
covered
by
the
guns
in
the
gate
-
towers
.
<EOS>
Not
a
single
man
was
lost
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
the
Royalists
had
been
uniformly
successful
,
and
had
baffled
all
the
attempts
of
the
enemy
,
generally
inflicting
severe
loss
upon
them
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
felt
that
these
constant
defeats
would
only
make
the
besiegers
more
determined
,
and
that
their
efforts
to
take
the
mansion
would
be
redoubled
.
<EOS>
The
besieged
had
no
fear
of
such
a
result
,
but
to
prevent
it
the
utmost
vigilance
and
activity
were
required
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XVIIOf
the
Preparations
made
for
a
Grand
SortieBY
this
time
the
works
of
the
besiegers
had
made
great
progress
.
<EOS>
Bulwarks
had
been
cast
up
,
but
as
yet
all
the
batteries
had
not
been
mounted
with
cannon
.
<EOS>
It
was
also
certain
that
a
mine
had
been
commenced
,
which
it
was
intended
should
pass
under
the
moat
,
either
for
the
purpose
of
blowing
up
some
of
the
towers
,
or
cutting
off
the
water
.
<EOS>
As
the
deep
well
from
which
the
garrison
was
abundantly
supplied
was
situated
in
the
very
centre
of
the
castle
,
it
would
necessarily
take
the
miners
some
time
to
reach
it
,
and
it
was
resolved
to
sink
a
countermine
to
meet
them
as
soon
as
their
course
could
be
discovered
.
<EOS>
Engineers
were
,
therefore
,
posted
in
various
places
to
listen
for
any
sounds
that
might
guide
them
in
their
task
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
these
disquieting
circumstances
the
courage
of
the
countess
remained
unshaken
,
and
,
indeed
,
rose
higher
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
uneasiness
manifested
by
any
one
in
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
Even
those
not
engaged
in
its
defence
were
full
of
ardour
.
<EOS>
But
the
person
most
interested
in
the
siege
was
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
As
we
have
shown
,
she
took
an
active
part
in
the
defence
of
the
house
—
carried
messages
and
orders
—
mounted
ramparts
and
towers
—
and
watched
the
cannonier
when
he
pointed
his
gun
,
and
would
have
done
more
if
she
had
been
permitted
.
<EOS>
Her
great
desire
was
to
attend
a
sortie
,
and
she
would
have
accompanied
the
first
expedition
habited
in
male
attire
,
if
the
countess
would
have
allowed
her
.
<EOS>
With
this
recklessness
,
she
now
passed
hours
in
the
postern
-
tower
,
accounted
the
most
dangerous
part
of
the
castle
,
being
most
exposed
to
a
sudden
assault
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Here
she
could
watch
the
progress
of
their
fortifications
,
and
could
count
the
sakers
,
the
periers
,
the
minions
,
and
falconets
on
their
batteries
.
<EOS>
One
morning
while
engaged
in
her
survey
she
perceived
that
the
besiegers
had
begun
a
new
fort
on
which
they
were
most
diligently
employed
.
<EOS>
Fixed
on
the
summit
of
a
rising
ground
at
a
short
distance
on
the
south
-
west
,
it
commanded
the
whole
of
the
mansion
;
but
the
position
being
too
high
for
cannon
<EOS>
,
it
was
evident
the
battery
was
intended
for
a
mortar
,
or
a
bombard
,
The
sconce
was
circular
,
and
surrounded
by
a
rampart
,
which
,
as
yet
,
was
unfinished
.
<EOS>
On
making
this
discovery
,
Gertrude
hastened
to
the
countess
,
but
her
ladyship
had
already
been
informed
of
the
new
fort
by
Major
Farrington
and
Standish
,
and
had
given
orders
that
it
should
be
destroyed
,
if
possible
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
the
cannoniers
had
just
opened
fire
,
and
having
killed
two
of
the
men
,
and
driven
away
the
rest
,
were
knocking
down
the
ramparts
.
<EOS>
"We
may
check
the
work
for
a
time
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
certain
it
will
be
resumed
on
the
first
opportunity
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
doubt
the
sconce
is
designed
for
the
large
mortar
,
with
which
we
have
been
threatened
,
"
observed
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"The
monster
shall
be
silenced
as
soon
as
he
begins
to
roar
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
Meantime
,
we
must
make
another
sortie
,
and
destroy
the
works
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
have
been
too
long
unmolested
,
and
have
grown
insolent
.
<EOS>
""I
approve
of
your
design
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
But
this
time
,
you
must
take
a
large
party
with
you
,
and
do
the
work
effectually
.
<EOS>
How
say
you
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
she
added
,
to
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
half
the
garrison
should
go
forth
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
""I
am
quite
of
your
ladyship
's
opinion
,
"
replied
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
inflict
a
blow
upon
them
,
calculated
to
shake
their
overweening
confidence
.
<EOS>
""True
,
"
rejoined
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
near
approach
of
those
forts
and
batteries
is
unpleasant
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
must
give
Captain
Standish
the
command
of
this
expedition
.
<EOS>
""In
an
affair
of
this
kind
,
wherein
so
large
a
number
of
men
will
be
concerned
<EOS>
,
more
than
one
leader
will
be
required
,
"
said
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"
I
therefore
propose
—
with
your
ladyship
's
approval
—
to
divide
the
party
into
three
squadrons
—
one
squadron
to
be
commanded
by
Captain
Standish
,
another
by
Captain
Farmer
,
and
the
third
by
Captain
Molineux
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
This
will
prevent
any
jealousy
.
<EOS>
""You
are
right
,
"
said
the
countess
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
trust
Captain
Standish
is
satisfied
with
the
arrangement
.
<EOS>
""Perfectly
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
desire
no
better
.
<EOS>
""Each
<EOS>
officer
can
take
his
own
lieutenant
,
"
pursued
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"Mine
<EOS>
shall
be
Bretergh
,
"
cried
Standish
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
propose
to
make
several
other
arrangements
within
the
mansion
,
"
said
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
before
doing
so
,
I
desire
to
consult
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
me
hear
them
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"First
<EOS>
then
,
at
the
gates
,
which
must
be
kept
open
,
and
the
drawbridge
down
,
I
shall
station
Captain
Ogle
and
a
party
of
musketeers
to
defend
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
Should
the
enemy
approach
—
though
I
do
not
deem
it
likely
—
the
cannoniers
will
fire
upon
them
from
the
towers
and
gate
-
house
.
<EOS>
The
sally
-
port
in
the
postern-
tower
shall
be
guarded
by
Captain
Chisenhale
with
a
party
of
men
ready
to
succour
our
friends
should
they
need
aid
.
<EOS>
Captain
Rawsthorne
shall
have
charge
of
the
musketeers
upon
the
walls
,
while
Captain
Foxe
shall
be
posted
on
the
summit
of
the
Eagle
Tower
,
and
with
a
pair
of
flags
signal
the
movements
of
the
enemy
—
so
that
our
friends
may
know
when
to
advance
or
retire
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
plan
seems
well
considered
,
"
remarked
the
countess
;
"
and
if
fully
carried
out
,
as
I
doubt
not
it
will
be
,
can
not
fail
to
be
successful
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
thought
that
signals
might
be
given
from
the
Eagle
Tower
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
there
myself
.
<EOS>
And
you
shall
attend
me
,
if
you
will
,
damsel
,
"
she
added
to
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"Your
ladyship
could
not
confer
a
greater
favour
upon
me
,
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
,
Major
Farrington
and
Standish
quitted
the
countess
to
make
preparations
for
the
proposed
sortie
.
<EOS>
Though
the
utmost
activity
prevailed
within
the
garrison
,
no
sign
of
it
was
manifest
to
the
enemy
,
who
began
to
think
the
besieged
had
taken
alarm
and
were
meditating
a
surrender
.
<EOS>
The
besiegers
therefore
resumed
the
work
they
had
suspended
,
and
repaired
the
damage
done
to
the
sconce
,
intending
to
play
the
mortar
with
stones
of
eighty
pounds
weight
on
the
following
day
.

the
Daring
Deeds
done
by
the
Cavaliers
in
the
Sortie
;
and
how
the
New
Fort
was
taken
by
StandishAt
an
early
hour
next
day
,
Captain
Foxe
having
received
his
orders
from
Major
Farrington
,
mounted
to
the
summit
of
the
Eagle
Tower
,
accompanied
by
a
soldier
bearing
a
pair
of
flags
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
had
gained
his
post
he
looked
around
to
see
whether
anything
indicated
that
the
enemy
suspected
the
meditated
attack
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
unusual
movement
amongst
them
.
<EOS>
The
morning
was
bright
and
clear
,
and
he
could
perceive
every
object
distinctly
,
without
the
aid
of
a
spy
-
glass
,
though
he
had
one
with
him
.
<EOS>
Four
camps
were
in
view
,
but
there
was
no
unwonted
stir
in
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
saw
the
men
assembling
in
answer
to
the
morning
call
,
and
he
likewise
beheld
small
parties
moving
towards
the
trenches
and
fortifications
to
relieve
guard
.
<EOS>
But
the
numbers
were
not
greater
than
usual
,
nor
did
the
besiegers
quicken
their
march
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
with
this
distant
survey
,
he
next
examined
the
fortifications
,
that
now
completely
encircled
the
besieged
mansion
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
these
earth-
works
and
batteries
,
though
ill
-
provided
with
cannon
,
presented
a
very
formidable
appearance
,
and
it
seemed
absolutely
necessary
for
the
security
of
the
place
that
they
should
be
destroyed
.
<EOS>
Captain
Foxe
had
just
completed
his
survey
,
when
turning
round
he
perceived
Gertrude
,
and
bade
her
good
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"I
am
sent
by
the
countess
for
information
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
As
you
are
aware
,
there
is
to
be
an
early
morning
service
for
the
officers
and
men
chosen
for
the
attack
;
and
before
proceeding
to
the
chapel
,
her
ladyship
desired
to
know
if
all
is
quiet
without
.
<EOS>
""Her
<EOS>
ladyship
need
have
no
uneasiness
,
"
rejoined
Foxe
.
<EOS>
"
The
enemy
suspects
nothing
.
<EOS>
We
shall
take
them
by
surprise
—
of
that
I
am
certain
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
going
to
the
chapel
,
I
would
entreat
you
to
offer
up
a
prayer
for
me
.
<EOS>
"Promising
<EOS>
compliance
,
Gertrude
disappeared
.
<EOS>
On
returning
to
the
countess
she
told
her
what
she
had
heard
,
and
the
devout
dame
being
freed
from
all
immediate
anxiety
,
proceeded
with
her
daughters
to
the
chapel
,
which
was
crowded
with
musketeers
fully
equipped
for
the
conflict
,
and
presented
a
very
striking
sight
.
<EOS>
Never
had
Archdeacon
Rutter
preached
a
more
animated
sermon
than
he
did
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
On
the
conclusion
of
the
service
,
the
three
parties
of
musketeers
,
each
under
the
command
of
a
captain
and
lieutenant
,
were
drawn
up
in
the
outer
court
,
and
after
the
countess
had
addressed
a
few
words
to
them
calculated
to
rouse
their
ardour
,
they
prepared
to
sally
forth
upon
the
foe
.
<EOS>
As
the
attacks
,
though
made
from
various
points
,
were
to
be
simultaneous
,
it
was
no
sooner
ascertained
that
the
two
squadrons
under
the
command
of
Captain
Farmer
and
Captain
Molineux
Radcliffe
were
ready
to
issue
from
the
sally
-
port
in
the
postern
tower
,
than
the
gate
was
thrown
open
,
and
the
drawbridge
lowered
,
and
Standish
and
his
men
dashed
out
,
while
Captain
Ogle
with
another
party
of
musketeers
,
blocked
up
the
gateway
,
so
as
to
prevent
all
ingress
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
the
walls
were
thronged
with
marksmen
,
under
the
command
of
Captain
Rawsthorne
and
Lieutenants
Walthew
and
Halsall
.
<EOS>
The
engineers
in
every
tower
stood
beside
their
guns
with
lighted
match
in
hand
,
and
only
awaited
the
order
to
fire
.
<EOS>
Need
we
add
that
Captain
Foxe
was
at
his
post?Just
before
the
attack
began
,
the
countess
appeared
on
the
Eagle
Tower
,
attended
by
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
Captain
Foxe
did
not
allow
himself
to
be
distracted
by
their
presence
,
but
kept
a
careful
look
out
.
<EOS>
IllustrationFor
a
few
minutes
the
countess
and
her
attendant
spoke
not
a
word
,
and
strange
to
say
,
scarcely
a
sound
seemed
to
reach
them
from
beneath
.
<EOS>
Their
gaze
was
riveted
upon
the
postern
-
tower
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
the
sally
-
port
was
opened
,
and
from
it
poured
out
with
astonishing
rapidity
a
large
band
of
musketeers
with
Captain
Farmer
at
their
head
.
<EOS>
While
they
were
forming
,
another
party
came
forth
with
equal
quickness
,
under
the
command
of
Captain
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
Before
commencing
the
attack
,
the
two
leaders
turned
their
gaze
towards
the
Eagle
Tower
,
and
saw
that
Captain
Foxe
waved
the
red
flag
to
them
to
advance
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
enemy
had
taken
the
alarm
,
and
were
gathering
thickly
in
their
fortifications
,
whence
they
fired
upon
their
assailants
,
but
could
not
check
them
in
their
onset
.
<EOS>
Sustained
by
the
musketeers
and
marksmen
on
the
ramparts
of
the
mansion
,
who
were
admirably
directed
by
Captain
Rawsthorne
,
the
assailants
scaled
these
bulwarks
,
and
drove
the
engineers
from
their
guns
,
killing
several
,
and
firing
with
deadly
effect
upon
the
soldiers
who
came
to
their
relief
.
<EOS>
While
the
conflict
was
raging
in
this
quarter
,
Captain
Standish
,
who
had
issued
with
his
men
from
the
gateway
,
had
attacked
another
part
of
the
works
,
and
with
equal
bravery
and
success
.
<EOS>
The
attack
had
not
lasted
more
than
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
already
he
had
gained
two
batteries
,
and
killed
three
men
with
his
own
hand
.
<EOS>
But
his
main
object
was
to
spike
the
great
mortar
,
and
leaving
Lieutenant
Bretergh
and
those
with
him
to
deal
with
the
cannon
on
the
batteries
,
he
forced
his
way
to
the
rising
ground
on
which
the
huge
piece
of
ordnance
was
placed
.
<EOS>
An
attempt
was
made
by
the
enemy
to
defend
this
little
fort
,
but
nothing
could
resist
the
impetuosity
of
Standish
and
his
followers
.
<EOS>
In
an
inconceivably
short
space
of
time
they
climbed
the
ramparts
,
and
put
the
engineers
to
the
sword
after
a
brief
struggle
,
and
were
consequently
masters
of
the
fort
.
<EOS>
This
daring
exploit
,
witnessed
from
the
walls
and
towers
of
the
mansion
,
was
hailed
with
shouts
.
<EOS>
Striking
the
wide
-
mouthed
and
ponderous
piece
of
ordnance
with
his
sword
,
and
regretting
that
its
enormous
weight
prevented
its
removal
,
Standish
ordered
it
to
be
spiked
,
and
the
work
was
effectually
performed
by
one
of
the
men
who
had
come
provided
with
a
smith
's
hammer
and
nails
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
going
on
,
Standish
looked
up
at
the
Eagle
Tower
and
perceived
that
Captain
Foxe
was
giving
him
a
signal
to
retreat
by
waving
a
white
flag
in
such
a
manner
as
to
intimate
that
a
large
body
of
the
enemy
was
advancing
from
the
camp
.
<EOS>
Compelled
,
however
,
to
tarry
for
a
few
minutes
longer
,
Standish
looked
around
,
and
witnessed
the
end
of
a
sharp
conflict
between
Lieutenant
Worral
and
the
occupants
of
an
adjoining
battery
.
<EOS>
Having
sprung
suddenly
into
the
work
,
sword
in
hand
,
the
valiant
lieutenant
had
been
instantly
surrounded
by
a
host
of
his
foes
,
but
he
managed
to
defend
himself
against
them
all
till
Captain
Farmer
came
to
his
assistance
and
delivered
him
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
Standish
caught
sight
of
his
friends
,
and
responded
to
their
shout
of
triumph
by
waving
his
sword
.
<EOS>
Everywhere
success
had
attended
the
Cavaliers
in
their
onslaught
,
though
the
enemy
trebled
them
in
number
,
and
were
protected
by
forts
and
ramparts
.
<EOS>
The
assailants
were
supported
by
the
musketeers
and
cannoniers
on
the
walls
and
in
the
towers
of
the
castle
;
but
the
latter
had
to
fire
carefully
for
fear
of
injuring
their
friends
.
<EOS>
But
the
Cavaliers
were
so
impetuous
that
they
scarcely
seemed
to
need
aid
.
<EOS>
Animated
by
a
burning
desire
to
chastise
the
insolence
of
the
rebels
,
and
inflict
a
severe
blow
upon
them
,
they
succeeded
almost
beyond
expectation
.
<EOS>
Many
daring
deeds
were
done
that
gave
renown
to
those
who
performed
them
.
<EOS>
A
battery
was
taken
single
-
handed
by
Captain
Radcliffe
,
who
slew
seven
men
with
his
own
hand
,
and
a
feat
almost
equally
remarkable
was
achieved
by
Lieutenant
Pesketh
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
a
panic
seized
the
besiegers
,
who
had
lost
altogether
more
than
fifty
men
.
<EOS>
No
prisoners
were
made
by
the
Royalists
,
because
they
had
found
that
the
Parliamentarian
commanders
were
unwilling
to
exchange
them
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
whole
line
of
fortifications
was
abandoned
,
all
the
cannon
were
spiked
,
and
as
far
as
possible
the
works
were
destroyed
.
<EOS>
An
immense
number
of
muskets
were
taken
.
<EOS>
For
some
moments
the
signal
given
by
Captain
Foxe
was
unheeded
,
the
victors
being
unwilling
to
retire
,
but
at
length
Captain
Standish
prepared
to
re
-
enter
the
castle
,
and
the
other
leaders
followed
his
example
.
<EOS>
Though
scattered
about
,
the
men
were
speedily
got
together
,
and
the
retreat
was
executed
in
very
good
order
,
<EOS>
albeit
a
troop
of
horse
,
under
the
command
of
Colonel
Rigby
,
was
close
at
hand
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
But
no
attempt
at
interruption
was
offered
,
and
Rigby
,
though
highly
incensed
,
did
not
deem
it
prudent
to
expose
himself
to
the
fire
of
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
Thus
Standish
was
allowed
to
cross
the
drawbridge
,
and
pass
through
the
gates
unmolested
,
while
equal
good
fortune
befel
Captain
Farmer
and
Captain
Molineux
Radcliffe
,
as
they
entered
the
postern
-
tower
.
<EOS>
On
descending
from
the
Eagle
Tower
,
the
countess
found
the
three
victorious
squadrons
drawn
up
in
the
court
-
yard
,
and
gave
them
a
hearty
greeting
,
telling
them
how
much
she
was
beholden
to
them
,
and
how
highly
she
appreciated
their
valour
.
<EOS>
"I
have
always
believed
,
and
I
now
find
I
was
right
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
I
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
enemy
so
long
as
I
possess
such
valiant
soldiers
as
you
.
<EOS>
""We
have
all
vowed
to
defend
your
ladyship
to
the
last
,
"
cried
the
men
enthusiastically
.
"
<EOS>
And
we
will
keep
our
oath
.
<EOS>
God
bless
the
king
and
the
Earl
of
Derby
.
"And
<EOS>
the
court
resounded
with
their
shouts
,
which
being
taken
up
by
the
musketeers
on
the
ramparts
,
were
heard
by
Rigby
and
his
troop
,
heightening
the
rage
of
the
Parliamentary
commander
,
and
determining
him
to
take
ample
revenge
.
<EOS>
"Your
ladyship
will
be
pleased
to
hear
,
"
said
Standish
,
advancing
,
"
that
although
we
have
slain
many
of
the
enemy
,
and
brought
away
their
arms
,
we
have
not
left
a
man
behind
.
<EOS>
""That
is
marvellous
,
and
proves
that
Heaven
is
with
us
,
"
replied
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
We
should
be
wanting
in
gratitude
if
we
did
not
return
thanks
for
the
great
mercy
vouchsafed
us
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
accompanied
by
Archdeacon
Rutter
and
her
daughters
,
she
proceeded
to
the
chapel
,
where
shortly
afterwards
all
those
who
had
been
engaged
in
the
recent
conflict
were
assembled
.

CHAPTER
XIXHow
a
Council
of
War
was
held
by
the
Besiegers
;
and
how
a
Day
of
Fasting
and
Prayer
was
appointed
by
FairfaxNOT
satisfied
with
the
damage
done
by
the
attack
just
described
,
the
engineers
in
the
towers
kept
up
a
constant
fire
upon
the
enemy
,
and
strove
to
prevent
them
from
repairing
the
fortifications
,
and
unspiking
the
cannon
.
<EOS>
In
this
manner
the
besiegers
were
harassed
throughout
the
entire
day
,
and
at
night
they
were
alarmed
by
a
fresh
sortie
conducted
by
Captain
Chisenhale
and
Captain
Ogle
.
<EOS>
Though
this
sortie
was
on
a
small
scale
,
and
intended
merely
as
an
alarm
,
it
was
very
well
carried
out
,
and
produced
a
singular
result
.
<EOS>
Reinforcements
had
just
been
sent
to
the
trenches
by
Rigby
,
and
the
new-
comers
,
perplexed
by
the
shouts
and
cries
which
were
heard
on
all
sides
,
fired
upon
their
friends
,
whom
they
mistook
for
foes
,
and
killed
several
of
them
.
<EOS>
As
in
the
morning
,
the
Royalists
escaped
without
the
loss
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
These
repeated
disasters
produced
the
natural
effect
.
<EOS>
The
besiegers
lost
spirit
,
and
fought
badly
,
and
it
was
evident
they
would
go
on
still
worse
,
if
something
was
not
done
to
rouse
them
.
<EOS>
A
council
of
war
was
therefore
held
in
the
camp
,
at
which
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
and
the
three
commanders
were
present
.
<EOS>
Rigby
,
whose
rage
had
not
yet
subsided
,
and
who
considered
himself
aggrieved
by
the
want
of
attention
paid
him
by
the
general
,
was
very
anxious
that
the
mansion
should
be
assaulted
,
but
Fairfax
would
not
listen
to
the
proposition
.
<EOS>
"I
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
place
is
much
stronger
than
we
thought
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
that
an
assault
would
be
very
hazardous
.
<EOS>
I
shall
therefore
persist
in
my
plan
of
reducing
it
by
siege
.
<EOS>
This
is
slow
but
sure
,
whereas
if
we
should
be
repulsed
in
an
assault
,
the
whole
county
will
ring
with
the
news
,
hundreds
of
malignants
,
who
now
dare
not
show
their
heads
,
will
come
here
,
and
immense
service
will
consequently
be
done
to
the
royal
cause
.
<EOS>
""Should
the
attack
prove
unsuccessful
<EOS>
,
I
grant
that
such
would
be
the
case
,
"
replied
Rigby
;
"
and
I
know
Rosworm
is
averse
to
an
assault
,
but
I
do
not
think
there
is
any
risk
,
and
this
slow
siege
disheartens
our
men
.
<EOS>
These
last
successes
of
the
enemy
have
greatly
disheartened
them
.
<EOS>
""Hitherto
<EOS>
,
we
have
been
very
unlucky
,
it
must
be
owned
,
and
have
succeeded
in
none
of
our
designs
,
"
observed
Colonel
Assheton
.
<EOS>
"
Our
miners
have
not
yet
been
able
to
get
under
the
moat
,
and
the
scheme
to
drain
the
springs
on
the
south-
east
of
the
castle
that
supply
the
deep
well
inside
has
totally
failed
.
<EOS>
""We
must
employ
another
plan
,
and
drain
the
well
itself
,
"
said
Colonel
Moore
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
that
can
be
accomplished
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
doubt
,
"
said
Fairfax
;
"
and
although
we
have
met
with
many
more
obstructions
in
our
work
than
might
have
been
expected
,
we
have
made
good
progress
.
<EOS>
We
have
cut
off
all
supplies
from
without
.
<EOS>
No
fresh
provisions
have
been
obtained
by
the
garrison
,
and
as
their
stores
will
soon
run
short
,
they
must
submit
or
starve
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
prisoners
last
exchanged
declare
they
have
plenty
of
provisions
,
and
can
hold
out
for
a
couple
of
months
longer
,
"
remarked
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"It
is
the
countess
's
policy
to
make
it
appear
so
,
"
observed
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
not
possible
the
garrison
can
be
so
well
stored
.
<EOS>
""A
contrary
opinion
prevails
,
"
remarked
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
not
think
their
sallying
parties
have
succeeded
in
procuring
any
fresh
provisions
,
and
none
can
have
been
introduced
in
any
other
way
.
<EOS>
""You
are
sure
of
that
?
"
said
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"I
am
sure
of
it
,
"
replied
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
Since
I
took
possession
of
that
stand
in
the
park
and
the
windmill
<EOS>
neither
meat
nor
flour
can
have
been
carried
in
without
our
knowledge
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
may
be
sure
the
end
is
not
far
off
,
"
said
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
The
Earl
of
Derby
would
never
have
asked
for
a
free
passage
for
his
wife
and
children
had
he
believed
the
garrison
could
long
hold
out
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
her
ladyship
's
bold
answer
seems
to
have
undeceived
him
,
since
he
now
refuses
to
treat
for
a
surrender
,
"
rejoined
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"I
attach
little
importance
to
that
,
"
said
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
well
knows
her
ladyship
will
be
honourably
treated
.
<EOS>
As
you
say
that
our
men
are
dispirited
by
their
ill
success
,
and
they
may
haply
deem
that
our
undertaking
is
not
approved
by
Heaven
,
to
-
morrow
shall
be
observed
as
a
day
of
fasting
and
prayer
,
and
our
ministers
shall
be
enjoined
to
implore
Divine
assistance
in
our
behalf
.
<EOS>
""Such
<EOS>
an
injunction
will
do
much
good
,
"
said
Rigby
,
"
and
we
must
see
that
it
is
strictly
obeyed
.
<EOS>
With
so
many
zealous
ministers
as
we
have
in
the
camp
,
a
good
effect
can
not
fail
to
be
produced
.
<EOS>
Our
men
will
fight
all
the
better
after
listening
to
their
discourses
.
<EOS>
"Both
<EOS>
Colonel
Assheton
and
Colonel
Moore
concurred
in
the
opinion
that
a
day
of
fasting
and
supplication
would
do
infinite
good
,
and
the
order
for
its
rigid
observance
on
the
morrow
was
issued
accordingly
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
the
injunction
neglected
.
<EOS>
In
each
camp
,
as
we
have
said
,
there
were
several
ministers
—
many
more
than
were
needed
—
but
each
had
a
certain
number
of
listeners
to
whom
he
addressed
his
discourse
.
<EOS>
All
preached
against
the
countess
,
and
all
earnestly
besought
Heaven
to
aid
them
in
their
endeavours
to
drive
her
from
her
stronghold
,
denouncing
her
as
a
Papist
and
an
idolatress
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
most
infuriated
amongst
them
took
for
his
text
the
words
of
the
Prophet
:
<EOS>
"
Put
yourselves
in
array
against
Babylon
round
about
:
all
ye
that
bend
the
bow
shoot
at
her
,
spare
no
arrows
,
for
she
hath
sinned
against
the
Lord
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
discourse
of
this
zealot
produced
the
desired
effect
upon
his
hearers
,
and
they
resolved
to
carry
out
his
injunctions
.
<EOS>
But
the
soldiers
in
the
trenches
were
not
allowed
to
pass
the
day
in
quiet
.
<EOS>
Already
they
had
been
disturbed
in
their
devotions
by
an
occasional
cannon
shot
falling
among
them
;
and
at
last
they
were
roused
to
action
by
shouts
and
a
discharge
of
musketry
that
announced
that
the
restless
Cavaliers
were
again
at
hand
.

CHAPTER
XXHow
a
Cannon
-
shot
fired
by
the
Besiegers
burst
into
the
Countess
's
ChamberTHE
Countess
of
Derby
,
as
we
have
shown
,
was
a
very
early
riser
,
and
generally
appeared
on
the
parade
with
her
daughters
before
attending
service
in
the
chapel
;
but
on
the
third
morning
after
the
successful
attack
had
been
made
upon
the
enemy
,
she
had
not
quitted
her
chamber
at
a
somewhat
later
hour
than
usual
,
owing
to
the
unfavourable
state
of
the
weather
.
<EOS>
The
room
was
situated
at
the
end
of
the
great
gallery
in
the
upper
part
of
the
mansion
,
and
had
a
noble
bay
window
,
filled
with
stained
glass
,
looking
towards
the
south
.
<EOS>
The
furniture
was
of
oak
,
and
richly
carved
,
and
the
walls
were
covered
with
tapestry
.
<EOS>
Attached
to
the
room
was
an
ante
-
chamber
,
furnished
in
precisely
the
same
manner
,
except
that
it
was
not
provided
with
a
stately
bed
and
a
toilette-
table
.
<EOS>
The
rooms
had
formerly
been
occupied
by
Earl
William
and
his
countess
,
and
in
the
couch
,
just
alluded
to
,
that
pious
lady
had
breathed
her
last
.
<EOS>
On
the
morning
in
question
the
countess
was
in
the
ante
-
chamber
,
though
the
door
between
the
rooms
usually
masked
by
a
piece
of
arras
,
was
left
open
.
<EOS>
Her
private
devotions
had
been
finished
before
she
left
her
bedroom
,
and
she
was
seated
at
a
table
making
some
additions
to
a
journal
,
which
she
kept
in
the
hope
that
her
lord
might
one
day
peruse
it
.
<EOS>
The
last
records
were
very
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
All
had
gone
well
.
<EOS>
Though
the
besiegers
had
completed
their
trenches
and
mounted
their
batteries
they
could
not
hold
them
.
<EOS>
Their
guns
had
been
silenced
,
their
forts
partially
destroyed
,
and
if
they
began
the
work
again
,
she
felt
sure
that
with
Heaven
's
aid
the
like
result
would
follow
.
<EOS>
Therefore
she
was
of
good
heart
.
<EOS>
As
this
journal
was
intended
for
no
other
eye
than
her
lord
's
,
she
put
down
within
it
her
in
-
most
thoughts
,
and
these
words
now
flowed
from
her
<EOS>
pen:"Oh
,
my
dear
lord
,
I
have
an
arduous
task
to
perform
,
and
I
trust
strength
may
be
given
me
from
Above
to
accomplish
it
.
<EOS>
At
times
I
want
support
from
thee
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
thou
wert
with
me
now
,
to
counsel
and
encourage
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
wish
is
vain
,
yet
I
can
not
repress
it
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
I
am
only
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"When
<EOS>
the
brave
lady
had
finished
this
sentence
,
she
closed
the
little
volume
,
and
her
breast
found
relief
in
a
deep
sigh
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
her
countenance
had
a
different
expression
from
that
which
it
habitually
wore
.
<EOS>
The
haughty
and
resolute
look
that
usually
marked
her
features
had
disappeared
,
and
a
feminine
softness
succeeded
,
and
lasted
so
long
as
she
was
alone
;
but
when
Gertrude
entered
the
room
,
she
instantly
shook
off
the
feeling
and
became
determined
as
ever
.
<EOS>
"You
have
a
letter
for
me
<EOS>
,
I
perceive
,
"
she
said
to
the
damsel
,
after
bidding
her
good
-
morrow
.
"
<EOS>
Whence
comes
it
?
<EOS>
From
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax?""From
the
noble
lord
,
your
husband
,
madam
,
"
replied
Gertrude
,
giving
her
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
luckless
messenger
who
brought
it
reached
the
posterngate
unharmed
.
<EOS>
There
he
was
struck
by
a
shot
from
the
enemy
,
but
had
strength
enough
left
to
fling
the
letter
to
the
guard
.
<EOS>
""He
should
have
had
a
better
reward
for
the
service
,
"
sighed
the
countess
.
<EOS>
Then
opening
the
letter
,
and
casting
her
eyes
over
it
,
she
said:"My
lord
approves
of
my
refusal
to
surrender
to
Fairfax
,
and
bids
me
to
listen
to
no
propositions
,
but
hold
on
,
as
I
am
certain
to
be
relieved
.
<EOS>
That
is
well
.
<EOS>
Had
he
commanded
otherwise
,
I
could
scarce
have
obeyed
him
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
not
think
your
ladyship
could
be
forced
to
surrender
to
the
rebels
,
"
observed
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"Thou
<EOS>
art
<EOS>
right
,
girl
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
blow
up
this
house
and
bury
us
all
in
the
ruins
rather
than
yield
to
them
,
so
you
know
the
fate
that
awaits
you
,
if
you
stay
with
me
.
<EOS>
""I
am
not
afraid
,
"
replied
Gertrude
,
with
a
firmness
equal
to
her
own
.
<EOS>
"Thou
<EOS>
art
a
brave
girl
<EOS>
,
"
cried
the
countess
,
approvingly
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
the
three
young
ladies
Stanley
entered
the
room
,
and
flew
towards
their
mother
.
<EOS>
"You
have
a
letter
from
our
dear
father
,
"
they
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Is
he
coming
to
drive
the
enemy
<EOS>
away?""Not
yet
,
"
replied
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"He
may
come
too
late
,
"
cried
Lady
Henriette
Marie
.
<EOS>
"
They
say
the
rebels
are
more
threatening
than
ever
,
and
are
determined
to
batter
down
our
walls
as
soon
as
their
cannon
will
fire
properly
.
<EOS>
""I
am
afraid
of
that
terrible
mortar
,
"
said
Lady
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Captain
Standish
says
they
have
taken
the
nails
from
it
,
and
we
may
soon
expect
to
hear
its
dreadful
voice
again
.
<EOS>
""I
think
the
culverin
and
the
saker
make
noise
enough
,
"
said
the
little
Lady
Amelia
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
to
have
that
music
all
day
.
<EOS>
""They
will
cease
firing
when
they
find
they
can
do
us
no
harm
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
By
this
time
they
ought
to
have
found
out
that
they
can
make
no
impression
on
our
walls
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
they
may
damage
the
house
,
"
said
Lady
Henriette
.
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
,
a
terrible
crash
was
heard
in
the
adjoining
chamber
,
followed
by
the
descent
of
a
heavy
body
,
making
it
clear
that
a
cannon
shot
had
entered
the
window
,
and
dropped
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
Stanley
screamed
,
but
the
countess
and
Gertrude
maintained
their
composure
,
and
the
latter
instantly
rushed
into
the
other
room
to
see
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
As
she
supposed
,
a
ponderous
shot
had
broken
the
beautiful
glass
of
the
bay
window
,
and
rolled
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
"Tis
<EOS>
well
your
ladyship
had
left
the
room
ere
<EOS>
this
occurred
,
"
said
Gertrude
,
as
the
countess
came
in
,
followed
by
her
daughters
,
whose
countenances
bespoke
their
alarm
.
<EOS>
"Yes
,
I
have
been
wonderfully
preserved
,
"
replied
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
you
will
not
continue
to
occupy
the
room
,
mamma
?
"
cried
the
Lady
Henriette
.
"Wherefore
<EOS>
not
?
"
rejoined
her
mother
,
"
Heaven
will
protect
me
.
<EOS>
"They
were
examining
the
shot
when
the
voices
of
Trioche
and
others
of
the
household
were
heard
without
,
praying
admittance
,
and
the
countess
bade
Gertrude
open
the
door
of
the
ante
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
Great
was
the
delight
of
these
faithful
servants
to
find
their
noble
mistress
unhurt
,
and
they
were
still
expressing
their
satisfaction
,
when
Major
Farrington
,
with
Standish
and
Archdeacon
Rutter
,
made
their
appearance
,
and
were
equally
pleased
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
knew
that
a
shot
had
struck
this
part
of
the
building
,
and
feared
mischief
,
"
said
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
since
your
ladyship
is
safe
all
is
well
.
<EOS>
""I
had
no
such
fear
,
madam
,
"
observed
Archdeacon
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"
I
felt
sure
Heaven
would
protect
you
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
engineer
who
fired
that
shot
will
never
fire
another
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
was
killed
next
moment
by
our
marksmen
,
and
his
place
has
not
yet
been
taken
,
as
is
evident
by
the
silence
of
the
culverin
.
<EOS>
""It
may
be
well
that
your
ladyship
should
show
yourself
,
"
said
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"
Fears
are
entertained
for
your
safety
.
<EOS>
""I
will
go
down
at
once
,
"
replied
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
must
perforce
change
my
lodging
till
that
window
is
repaired
,
but
the
enemy
shall
not
drive
me
from
my
room
.
<EOS>
""I
felt
sure
of
it
,
madam
,
"
said
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
Accompanied
by
her
daughters
and
Archdeacon
Rutter
,
the
countess
then
descended
to
the
parade
,
where
she
was
enthusiastically
received
by
the
officers
and
men
,
and
shouts
resounded
from
the
walls
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
rain
had
ceased
and
the
morning
had
become
bright
and
cheerful
.
<EOS>
After
remaining
in
the
court
for
a
few
minutes
,
she
proceeded
to
the
chapel
to
offer
up
thanks
for
her
preservation
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
three
or
four
engineers
on
the
batteries
of
the
besiegers
had
been
shot
,
and
apparently
not
a
man
could
be
found
to
work
the
guns
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
enemy
ceased
firing
altogether
,
and
the
garrison
became
completely
tranquillised
.
<EOS>
But
towards
evening
it
seemed
certain
—
from
preparations
that
were
then
being
made
—
that
the
mortar
would
again
be
tried
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXIOf
the
Experiments
made
by
the
Besiegers
with
the
Great
MortarNEXT
morning
,
as
Major
Farrington
,
in
company
with
Standish
,
reconnoitred
the
enemy
from
the
ramparts
,
he
perceived
they
were
again
very
busily
employed
in
the
sconce
in
which
the
great
mortar
was
placed
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
the
observers
could
make
out
,
some
two
hundred
men
were
collected
near
the
new
fort
,
and
it
was
evident
this
large
force
had
been
brought
there
to
resist
any
attack
.
<EOS>
"I
do
not
like
that
mortar
,
"
remarked
Major
Farrington
,
"
and
I
am
persuaded
it
will
give
us
more
trouble
than
all
the
rest
of
their
guns
put
together
.
<EOS>
""It
may
not
prove
so
formidable
as
you
anticipate
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
However
,
I
own
it
has
an
ugly
look
,
and
should
be
glad
if
its
large
mouth
could
be
stopped
,
but
that
does
not
seem
practicable
.
<EOS>
Nailing
it
is
useless
as
we
have
found
.
<EOS>
""Depend
<EOS>
upon
it
,
they
are
going
to
give
it
a
thorough
trial
to
-
day
,
"
said
Major
Farrington
;
"
and
unless
I
am
mistaken
some
of
their
commanders
are
in
the
sconce
to
witness
the
experiment
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
care
<EOS>
they
shall
not
have
a
very
pleasant
time
of
it
.
<EOS>
""If
Rigby
is
there
<EOS>
I
hope
a
shot
may
hit
him
,
"
rejoined
Standish
.
"
<EOS>
But
for
him
we
should
not
have
been
plagued
by
this
pestilent
mortar
.
<EOS>
"Major
<EOS>
Farrington
then
gave
orders
to
the
engineers
in
all
the
towers
facing
the
fort
in
question
to
concentrate
their
fire
upon
it
.
<EOS>
This
was
done
and
carried
on
so
persistently
,
that
at
length
not
a
man
could
be
seen
above
the
ramparts
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
besiegers
were
not
to
be
deterred
from
their
design
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
a
thundering
sound
announced
that
the
mortar
had
been
discharged
,
and
a
ponderous
stone
—
the
course
of
which
could
be
traced
through
the
air
—
passed
over
the
walls
,
and
fell
in
the
court
,
luckily
without
doing
any
damage
,
though
causing
great
consternation
.
<EOS>
No
further
experiment
was
made
that
day
,
because
the
engineers
in
the
fort
were
afraid
to
work
,
owing
to
the
incessant
fire
kept
up
from
the
ramparts
;
but
enough
had
been
done
to
prove
the
tremendous
power
of
the
mortar
,
and
all
those
who
gazed
at
the
stone
thought
what
destruction
would
have
been
caused
had
it
fallen
on
the
top
of
a
tower
or
on
the
roof
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
Next
day
,
on
examining
the
magazine
,
Major
Farrington
made
the
unpleasant
discovery
that
the
powder
was
beginning
to
run
short
.
<EOS>
The
constant
firing
from
the
ramparts
and
towers
that
had
taken
place
during
the
last
week
had
well
-
nigh
exhausted
the
stock
,
and
although
a
considerable
supply
had
been
obtained
from
the
trenches
of
the
enemy
during
the
sallies
,
very
little
was
left
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
,
the
countess
became
uneasy
when
she
received
this
alarming
intelligence
,
and
she
gave
peremptory
orders
that
no
more
powder
should
be
wasted
.
<EOS>
Not
a
needless
shot
must
be
fired
.
<EOS>
Standish
and
the
officers
did
not
share
her
ladyship
's
uneasiness
,
because
they
felt
certain
the
trenches
would
yield
a
fresh
supply
,
and
the
men
were
not
altogether
pleased
by
the
restraint
put
upon
them
.
<EOS>
However
,
they
did
not
dare
to
disobey
orders
,
and
for
the
present
the
firing
almost
wholly
ceased
.
<EOS>
As
if
to
test
their
patience
,
the
enemy
were
more
active
than
usual
on
that
day
,
and
again
brought
all
their
ordnance
to
bear
upon
the
walls
.
<EOS>
Six
of
the
cannon
were
loaded
with
chain
-
shot
and
bars
of
iron
,
but
happily
did
little
mischief
.
<EOS>
They
then
tried
their
muskets
for
more
than
half
an
hour
together
,
but
with
no
better
success
.
<EOS>
Not
a
single
man
on
the
walls
was
hit
,
nor
could
they
provoke
a
reply
.
<EOS>
Later
on
,
they
made
another
experiment
with
the
great
mortar
,
and
this
time
a
grenado
was
thrown
at
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
It
fell
in
a
small
court
at
the
back
of
the
chapel
where
it
exploded
,
and
with
such
violence
that
it
shook
down
the
walls
near
it
.
<EOS>
Again
no
one
was
injured
,
but
infinite
alarm
was
caused
by
the
concussion
.
<EOS>
The
engineers
feared
that
some
new
fireballs
would
next
be
tried
,
and
men
provided
with
wet
hides
stood
ready
to
extinguish
these
combustibles
if
they
fell
near
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
Luckily
the
services
of
these
assistants
were
not
required
.
<EOS>
Only
a
second
stone
shot
was
launched
against
the
stronghold
,
and
did
no
harm
.
<EOS>
But
the
mortar
had
now
become
a
terrible
engine
,
and
frightened
the
brave
men
,
who
had
hitherto
derided
all
the
attempts
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
The
greater
part
of
the
mansion
was
built
of
oak
,
and
though
shot
proof
,
it
might
be
set
on
fire
.
<EOS>
This
seemed
now
to
be
the
aim
of
the
enemy
,
and
the
possibility
of
such
an
occurrence
filled
the
whole
garrison
with
alarm
.
<EOS>
The
staunchest
musketeer
turned
pale
when
speaking
of
shells
and
grenadoes
,
and
many
of
them
asked
permission
to
quit
their
lodgings
in
the
upper
part
of
the
walls
.
<EOS>
To
shame
them
from
their
fears
the
officers
removed
to
these
rooms
,
but
nothing
could
overcome
the
dread
caused
by
the
mortar
,
and
when
next
day
another
grenado
fell
in
the
midst
of
the
musketeers
it
scattered
them
like
so
many
sheep
.
<EOS>
Familiarity
,
however
,
with
the
danger
gave
them
courage
,
and
when
they
found
that
grenadoes
were
not
so
dangerous
as
they
imagined
—
no
one
as
yet
having
been
hurt
—
they
began
to
laugh
at
them
—
especially
when
a
couple
that
were
badly
aimed
,
flew
over
the
house
.
<EOS>
Just
at
this
time
an
incident
occurred
which
,
although
it
did
not
for
a
moment
shake
the
fortitude
of
the
countess
,
caused
her
great
annoyance
.
<EOS>
Despite
all
the
firing
and
the
danger
to
which
she
was
exposed
,
she
had
mounted
daily
—
sometimes
more
than
once
—
to
the
summit
of
the
Eagle
Tower
.
<EOS>
One
day
she
was
at
her
post
,
and
surrounded
by
her
usual
attendants
,
when
Major
Farrington
showed
her
that
the
engineers
in
a
battery
beneath
were
pointing
a
culverin
against
the
tower
on
which
she
stood
.
<EOS>
The
countess
looked
on
undismayed
,
and
smiled
as
the
shot
flew
harmlessly
past
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
a
demi
-
cannon
was
fired
from
an
adjacent
battery
,
its
mark
being
evidently
the
same
as
the
culverin
.
<EOS>
Shot
after
shot
from
both
pieces
of
ordnance
followed
at
short
intervals
,
but
the
tower
remained
untouched
.
<EOS>
"I
would
counsel
your
ladyship
to
descend
,
"
said
Major
Farrington
,
who
had
watched
this
display
with
anxiety
.
<EOS>
"
Those
cannoniers
have
evidently
got
orders
to
demolish
this
tower
,
and
they
will
not
desist
from
the
attempt
,
unless
we
stop
them
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
direct
our
engineers
to
fire
upon
them
?
<EOS>
They
will
not
do
so
without
orders
.
<EOS>
""Have
<EOS>
we
sufficient
powder
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
countess
,
in
a
low
voice
.
"Enough
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Not
more
.
<EOS>
""Then
let
the
enemy
fire
on
,
"
said
the
brave
lady
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
reserve
our
scanty
stock
for
a
more
important
occasion
.
<EOS>
""I
am
certain
Rigby
is
in
the
nearest
battery
with
the
culverin
,
"
said
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
see
him
now
.
<EOS>
""Say
<EOS>
you
so
?
"
said
the
countess
,
almost
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
,
by
Heaven
,
he
shall
not
insult
me
thus
.
<EOS>
Give
instant
orders
to
return
the
fire
.
<EOS>
At
any
hazard
we
will
silence
them
.
<EOS>
""I
am
right
glad
your
ladyship
has
so
resolved
,
"
said
Major
Farrington
,
as
he
departed
on
the
errand
.
<EOS>
Not
till
she
had
enjoyed
the
gratification
of
seeing
the
demi
-
cannon
dismounted
by
her
own
engineers
<EOS>
did
the
countess
quit
her
post
.
<EOS>
She
then
descended
to
the
court
,
feeling
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
answer
she
had
given
to
Rigby
's
insolent
challenge
.
<EOS>
But
her
triumph
was
of
short
duration
.
<EOS>
While
she
was
talking
to
Major
Farrington
,
who
had
come
to
meet
her
,
a
shot
from
the
culverin
struck
an
angle
in
the
Eagle
Tower
,
making
a
large
breach
in
the
wall
,
and
demolishing
part
of
the
staircase
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
ladyship
has
just
got
down
in
time
,
"
observed
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"
That
shall
be
the
last
stroke
of
Rigby
's
malice
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
made
good
his
word
.
<EOS>
The
culverin
did
not
fire
another
shot
,
both
engineers
being
killed
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXIIHow
a
Summons
was
sent
by
Rigby
to
the
Countess
to
yield
up
the
Castle
and
sue
for
Mercy
to
the
Parliament
;
and
of
the
Answer
<EOS>
she
returnedTHAT
<EOS>
night
it
was
very
dark
and
well
adapted
for
a
sortie
,
but
as
the
officers
were
not
allowed
to
sally
forth
in
consequence
of
the
scarcity
of
powder
,
they
resorted
to
a
device
to
annoy
the
enemy
,
that
proved
perfectly
successful
.
<EOS>
Balls
of
clay
,
furnished
with
a
lighted
match
,
such
as
were
used
by
the
musketeers
,
were
flung
from
the
ramparts
towards
the
enemy
's
works
,
and
quickly
attracted
the
attention
of
the
sentries
,
who
thought
an
assailing
party
was
at
hand
.
<EOS>
The
alarm
was
instantly
given
.
<EOS>
Drums
were
beaten
,
and
shortly
afterwards
,
muskets
and
periers
were
fired
in
the
direction
of
the
lights
.
<EOS>
For
a
short
time
this
went
on
,
to
the
great
delight
of
the
spectators
on
the
ramparts
,
when
the
besiegers
finding
the
lights
continue
motionless
,
suddenly
ceased
firing
.
<EOS>
Shouts
of
laughter
from
the
ramparts
explained
the
trick
played
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Next
morning
the
besiegers
began
to
shout
loudly
in
their
turn
,
being
evidently
desirous
of
attracting
the
attention
of
Major
Farrington
and
the
officers
of
the
garrison
to
a
fresh
stock
of
grenadoes
and
bombs
that
had
just
arrived
at
the
works
.
<EOS>
These
they
displayed
ostentatiously
,
and
pointing
significantly
to
the
fort
in
which
the
mortar
was
placed
,
vociferated
at
the
top
of
their
voices:"We
will
soon
send
you
some
of
them
.
<EOS>
"Burning
<EOS>
with
rage
,
the
men
would
fain
have
responded
to
these
insults
with
their
guns
,
but
were
forbidden
to
fire
.
<EOS>
But
the
sight
of
the
grenadoes
made
Major
Farrington
feel
very
anxious
,
and
he
had
a
long
conference
with
the
countess
,
during
which
he
represented
to
her
,
without
any
attempt
at
disguise
,
the
extreme
danger
to
be
apprehended
from
a
shower
of
these
terrible
projectiles
.
<EOS>
Two
other
persons
only
were
present
at
the
conference
.
<EOS>
These
were
Archdeacon
Rutter
and
Captain
Standish
,
but
though
deeply
interested
,
they
offered
no
opinion
.
<EOS>
"The
time
has
arrived
,
"
said
the
countess
,
after
some
minutes
'
reflection
,
"
when
a
heavy
blow
must
be
struck
against
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
At
any
risk
—
at
any
cost
—
we
must
deprive
him
of
that
mortar
.
<EOS>
""Unquestionably
,
that
would
be
the
heaviest
blow
that
could
be
dealt
him
,
"
rejoined
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
doubt
if
it
can
be
accomplished
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
such
doubt
,
"
said
the
countess
,
in
a
determined
tone
.
<EOS>
"
But
be
the
result
what
it
may
,
the
attempt
shall
be
made
,
and
without
delay
.
<EOS>
How
say
you
,
Captain
Standish
?
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
Are
there
not
officers
and
men
within
the
garrison
willing
to
undertake
this
perilous
task?""Assuredly
,
madam
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
not
an
officer
or
man
in
the
garrison
who
would
refuse
to
execute
any
command
given
him
by
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
The
more
hazardous
the
task
,
the
better
he
would
like
it
.
<EOS>
""I
spoke
not
of
zeal
or
courage
,
"
said
Major
Farrington
;
"
but
I
fear
that
the
bravest
and
most
devoted
men
will
find
it
impossible
to
remove
that
mortar
.
<EOS>
""It
must
be
brought
away
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
shall
be
,
madam
,
"
rejoined
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
Some
plan
shall
be
devised
for
its
removal
,
of
which
Major
Farrington
himself
will
approve
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
to
find
you
are
so
sanguine
,
"
observed
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
repeat
there
must
be
no
delay
.
<EOS>
The
plan
must
be
executed
forthwith
.
<EOS>
"Just
<EOS>
then
,
Captain
Chisenhale
entered
,
and
informed
the
countess
that
a
trumpeter
was
at
the
gate
,
and
brought
her
ladyship
a
letter
from
Colonel
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"From
Rigby
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
How
dares
he
write
to
me
?
<EOS>
Send
back
the
messenger
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
me
counsel
your
ladyship
to
hear
what
he
has
to
say
,
"
remarked
Archdeacon
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
then
reproach
yourself
hereafter
.
<EOS>
""That
is
good
advice
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
see
him
.
<EOS>
Let
the
man
come
to
the
parade
.
<EOS>
I
will
read
the
letter
publicly
,
that
all
who
list
,
may
hear
my
answer
.
<EOS>
""With
your
ladyship
's
permission
<EOS>
,
I
will
make
that
known
,
"
said
Captain
Chisenhale
.
<EOS>
And
he
bowed
and
departed
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
the
countess
proceeded
to
the
parade
accompanied
by
her
attendants
.
<EOS>
A
great
number
of
musketeers
were
assembled
to
hear
what
she
had
to
say
to
the
messenger
,
who
was
standing
in
their
midst
.
<EOS>
The
man
,
who
had
a
trumpet
suspended
from
his
shoulder
,
bore
himself
bravely
,
and
returned
the
fierce
looks
thrown
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
letter
in
his
belt
,
and
delivered
it
to
Captain
Chisenhale
,
by
whom
it
was
handed
to
the
countess
.
<EOS>
While
reading
the
missive
she
seemed
scarcely
able
to
control
her
indignation
,
and
when
she
had
done
,
she
called
out
in
a
loud
voice:"You
shall
all
hear
the
message
sent
me
by
that
insolent
fellow
Rigby
.
<EOS>
He
tells
me
this
is
his
last
letter
,
that
he
will
write
to
me
no
more
,
and
summons
me
to
yield
up
to
him
Lathom
House
,
and
all
the
persons
within
it
,
all
arms
and
munitions
,
and
sue
for
mercy
to
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Furthermore
,
he
requires
me
to
return
my
final
answer
before
two
o'clock
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
What
think
you
of
this
letter?"Cries
of
indignation
resounded
on
all
sides
,
and
menacing
looks
were
cast
at
the
messenger
.
<EOS>
"Come
<EOS>
forward
,
fellow
,
"
cried
the
countess
to
the
man
,
who
tremblingly
obeyed
.
<EOS>
"
It
were
a
fitting
reward
for
thy
presumption
to
hang
thee
up
at
my
gates
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
spare
me
,
I
pray
your
ladyship
,
"
cried
the
poor
wretch
,
seeing
how
eager
all
around
were
to
execute
the
threat
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
refuse
obedience
to
Colonel
Rigby
's
command
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
I
waste
not
my
anger
on
thee
.
<EOS>
Thou
art
merely
the
instrument
of
a
traitor
,
and
shalt
go
back
in
safety
.
<EOS>
Tell
the
insolent
rebel
how
I
received
his
letter
,
"
she
added
,
tearing
it
in
pieces
.
"
<EOS>
Tell
him
I
deride
his
summons
.
<EOS>
Never
shall
he
have
Lathom
House
—
never
!
<EOS>
Rather
than
surrender
it
to
him
I
will
burn
it
in
his
sight
.
<EOS>
We
will
all
perish
together
.
<EOS>
Myself
,
my
children
,
my
soldiers
,
and
my
household
will
seal
our
loyalty
and
religion
in
the
same
flame
.
<EOS>
This
is
my
final
answer
.
<EOS>
"As
she
concluded
,
loud
acclamations
arose
,
and
the
assemblage
shouted
with
one
voice
,
"
We
will
all
die
for
our
noble
lord
and
lady
!
<EOS>
God
save
the
king!"With
<EOS>
these
shouts
ringing
in
his
ears
,
the
Trumpet
was
hurried
to
the
gate
,
and
thrust
forth
ignominiously
,
glad
to
escape
with
life
.
<EOS>
When
he
got
back
to
Rigby
,
he
told
him
what
had
happened
,
and
added
,
that
in
his
opinion
the
garrison
would
never
surrender
.
<EOS>
"I
expected
no
other
answer
from
that
furious
woman
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
thou
art
mistaken
as
to
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
withstand
our
next
assault
.
<EOS>
""Wherefore
<EOS>
not
?
"
demanded
the
Trumpet
.
<EOS>
"Because
<EOS>
they
have
no
powder
,
"
replied
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
That
I
have
just
found
out
.
<EOS>
""I
can
scarcely
think
it
from
what
I
have
just
seen
and
heard
,
"
said
the
Trumpet
.
<EOS>
"'Tis
<EOS>
certain
,
nevertheless
,
"
rejoined
Rigby
.

CHAPTER
XXIIIShowing
how
the
Great
Mortar
was
captured
by
Standish
and
ChisenhaleIMMEDIATELY
after
the
departure
of
the
Trumpet
,
all
the
officers
of
the
garrison
were
summoned
to
a
council
,
at
which
it
was
decided
that
an
attempt
should
be
forthwith
made
to
bring
away
the
mortar
,
as
it
was
felt
that
the
capture
of
this
terrible
engine
would
inflict
the
heaviest
blow
on
the
enemy
,
and
serve
to
raise
the
flagging
spirits
of
their
own
men
.
<EOS>
The
best
mode
of
carrying
out
the
enterprise
was
then
discussed
,
and
various
plans
were
suggested
;
the
boldest
of
which
,
proposed
by
Captain
Standish
,
met
with
the
approval
of
the
countess
and
Major
Farrington
,
and
was
therefore
adopted
.
<EOS>
It
was
next
settled
that
the
sortie
should
be
made
about
half
an
hour
before
daybreak
on
the
morrow
,
and
the
utmost
caution
was
to
be
observed
,
so
as
not
to
alarm
the
sentinels
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
The
officers
appointed
to
the
dangerous
service
by
the
countess
were
Captains
Standish
and
Chisenhale
,
with
Lieutenants
Bretergh
and
Walthew
.
<EOS>
But
all
were
to
be
employed
.
<EOS>
To
Captains
Ogle
and
Foxe
the
command
of
the
main
guard
was
entrusted
.
<EOS>
Captain
Rawsthorne
had
charge
of
the
sally
-
port
.
<EOS>
Captain
Molineux
Radcliffe
had
command
of
the
marksmen
and
musketeers
;
and
the
post
assigned
to
Captain
Farmer
,
with
a
party
of
fifty
men
,
was
the
parade
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
he
had
charge
of
the
gateway
.
<EOS>
Not
only
was
employment
found
for
every
man
in
the
garrison
,
but
the
whole
of
the
household
,
which
numbered
more
than
a
dozen
stout
serving
-
men
,
had
a
special
duty
to
perform
.
<EOS>
They
were
to
be
under
the
command
of
the
steward
and
Trioche
,
and
were
to
aid
a
company
of
soldiers
in
levelling
the
ditch
.
<EOS>
No
objection
was
made
by
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
they
were
proud
to
be
thus
employed
,
and
only
begged
that
each
of
them
might
be
provided
with
a
pistol
to
be
used
against
the
enemy
if
an
opportunity
offered
.
<EOS>
Never
had
the
garrison
been
so
excited
before
,
because
they
had
never
before
such
a
difficult
and
dangerous
task
to
perform
,
and
even
the
boldest
felt
that
success
was
uncertain
.
<EOS>
Major
Farrington
retracted
the
opinion
he
had
at
first
expressed
as
to
the
impossibility
of
the
feat
,
but
he
was
secretly
anxious
;
and
even
the
countess
herself
,
despite
her
undaunted
demeanour
,
was
not
free
from
internal
misgiving
.
<EOS>
The
besiegers
remained
tolerably
quiet
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
,
and
only
indulged
in
an
occasional
shot
from
a
saker
or
a
perier
.
<EOS>
Rigby
made
no
experiment
with
his
new
grenadoes
and
fire
-
balls
,
reserving
them
for
the
following
afternoon
,
when
the
countess
was
informed
that
he
had
invited
Colonel
Holland
,
the
governor
of
Manchester
,
and
several
others
to
witness
the
destruction
of
her
house
.
<EOS>
When
this
was
told
her
by
Major
Farrington
,
she
simply
remarked:"I
am
glad
he
has
asked
so
many
of
his
friends
to
witness
his
own
discomfiture
.
<EOS>
"None
of
the
garrison
retired
to
rest
on
that
night
—
neither
did
the
countess
.
<EOS>
Long
before
it
was
light
all
were
prepared
.
<EOS>
Captain
Radcliffe
was
on
the
ramparts
with
his
marksmen
and
musketeers
,
and
Captain
Farmer
had
assembled
his
men
on
the
parade
.
<EOS>
Provided
with
strong
ropes
,
shovels
,
and
other
implements
,
the
serving
-
men
were
ready
to
set
forth
,
under
the
command
of
Trioche
and
the
steward
.
<EOS>
It
was
still
dark
,
when
the
sally
-
port
was
opened
,
and
two
companies
of
musketeers
,
each
numbering
fifty
men
,
came
forth
,
respectively
commanded
by
Standish
and
Chisenhale
.
<EOS>
So
noiseless
were
their
movements
,
that
their
approach
was
not
discovered
till
they
got
under
the
cannon
of
the
battery
nearest
them
,
the
ramparts
of
which
they
scaled
in
spite
of
the
desperate
resistance
of
the
soldiers
,
and
put
all
within
the
fort
to
the
sword
.
<EOS>
The
noise
of
this
conflict
roused
all
the
besiegers
from
their
slumber
,
but
the
assailants
had
successfully
accomplished
their
first
object
,
and
secured
themselves
a
retreat
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
they
had
obtained
a
fresh
supply
of
powder
.
<EOS>
Leaving
Bretergh
and
Walthew
with
a
sufficient
number
of
men
to
hold
the
fort
,
Standish
and
Chisenhale
fought
their
way
along
the
trenches
to
the
battery
on
which
the
mortar
was
placed
.
<EOS>
They
were
followed
in
their
march
by
the
party
of
serving
-
men
,
not
one
of
whom
manifested
the
slightest
fear
,
though
it
was
their
first
fight
.
<EOS>
The
sconce
in
which
the
mortar
was
placed
was
guarded
by
fifty
men
,
who
fired
upon
their
assailants
as
they
came
on
,
but
could
not
check
their
advance
,
and
did
them
little
injury
.
<EOS>
From
the
position
of
this
fort
,
which
has
been
described
as
on
a
rising
ground
,
it
was
soon
found
by
the
Royalists
that
their
muskets
were
useless
.
<EOS>
They
therefore
picked
up
some
of
the
large
stones
lying
about
,
and
hurled
them
over
the
ramparts
.
<EOS>
The
clatter
of
these
missiles
on
the
steel
headpieces
was
prodigious
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
soldiers
were
stunned
and
fell
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Others
fled
.
<EOS>
Taking
advantage
of
their
confusion
,
the
assailants
quickly
cleared
the
ditch
surrounding
the
fort
,
and
scaling
the
ramparts
,
killed
several
of
the
enemy
,
and
put
the
rest
to
flight
.
<EOS>
Having
thus
secured
their
prize
,
they
gave
a
loud
shout
,
which
was
returned
by
their
comrades
in
the
battery
they
had
first
taken
,
and
again
by
the
musketeers
on
the
postern
-
tower
and
on
the
walls
of
the
castle
.
<EOS>
The
time
had
now
come
when
the
assistance
of
the
serving
-
men
,
who
had
attended
them
during
the
attack
,
was
required
.
<EOS>
These
stout
fellows
,
who
,
it
has
been
said
,
were
provided
with
the
necessary
implements
,
soon
contrived
to
level
the
trench
,
while
the
musketeers
pulled
down
a
portion
of
the
ramparts
.
<EOS>
A
passage
being
thus
made
for
the
mortar
,
it
was
dragged
by
a
score
of
strong
hands
from
the
sconce
,
then
down
the
side
of
the
mound
,
and
across
the
now
levelled
trench
.
<EOS>
Thus
much
was
accomplished
without
opposition
.
<EOS>
But
the
enemy
were
resolved
to
prevent
the
removal
of
the
great
engine
.
<EOS>
A
large
party
of
musketeers
rushed
forward
with
shouts
and
attacked
the
successful
Royalists
,
who
returned
their
fire
,
and
a
sharp
conflict
ensued
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
did
not
last
long
.
<EOS>
Aided
by
Captain
Molineux
Radcliffe
from
the
walls
of
the
castle
,
which
were
within
musket
-
shot
,
Standish
and
Chisenhale
were
soon
able
to
disperse
the
foe
,
and
moved
on
as
fast
as
they
could
with
their
prize
towards
the
gateway
.
<EOS>
Two
other
attempts
were
made
to
check
their
retreat
,
but
were
equally
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
The
victors
were
now
joined
by
Bretergh
and
Walthew
with
the
party
from
the
battery
first
taken
,
and
their
force
was
sufficient
to
repel
any
attack
.
<EOS>
So
they
moved
on
tranquilly
under
the
guns
of
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
They
had
good
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
the
result
of
the
sortie
.
<EOS>
Not
only
had
they
secured
the
grand
prize
for
which
they
had
come
forth
,
but
what
was
nearly
as
important
,
they
had
obtained
a
large
supply
of
powder
;
so
that
they
were
now
quite
easy
on
that
score
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
all
these
things
,
snatched
from
the
very
teeth
of
the
foe
,
they
brought
back
with
them
a
great
number
of
muskets
,
three
drums
,
and
five
prisoners
—
the
latter
captured
at
the
battery
from
which
the
mortar
was
taken
.
<EOS>
As
the
victors
entered
the
gates
they
were
welcomed
by
the
guard
with
shouts
and
other
demonstrations
of
delight
,
but
this
was
nothing
compared
to
the
frantic
enthusiasm
manifested
by
the
soldiers
collected
in
the
court
-
yard
at
the
sight
of
the
mortar
.
<EOS>
They
could
scarcely
believe
that
the
terrible
engine
that
had
caused
them
so
much
alarm
was
standing
before
them
.
<EOS>
They
struck
it
with
their
guns
,
they
spurned
it
,
they
leaped
upon
it
,
they
danced
round
it
,
and
committed
a
hundred
extravagances
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
monster
,
"
cried
one
of
them
,
who
had
jumped
inside
it
,
and
tried
to
make
it
ring
with
the
butt
-
end
of
his
gun
,
"
we
have
thee
now
,
and
will
not
let
thee
go
.
<EOS>
""Little
<EOS>
did
Rigby
think
when
he
had
thee
cast
,
in
the
hope
that
thou
wouldst
accomplish
our
destruction
,
that
thou
wouldst
soon
be
turned
against
himself
,
and
help
to
deliver
us
from
him
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
speech
was
received
with
loud
cheers
and
laughter
by
all
who
heard
it
,
and
the
mortar
rang
like
an
anvil
with
the
blows
dealt
against
it
.
<EOS>
The
officers
did
not
attempt
to
check
the
exuberant
delight
of
the
men
,
for
they
were
almost
as
much
excited
themselves
.
<EOS>
The
countess
,
who
was
in
the
court
-
yard
with
her
daughters
and
her
customary
attendants
,
was
enchanted
by
the
spectacle
.
<EOS>
The
shouts
and
demonstrations
of
the
men
delighted
her
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
their
confidence
—
if
it
had
been
at
all
shaken
—
was
completely
restored
,
and
that
henceforth
all
would
go
on
well
.
<EOS>
After
watching
the
spectacle
for
a
few
minutes
,
she
desired
Major
Farrington
to
bring
before
her
Standish
,
Chisenhale
,
and
the
other
officers
,
who
had
assisted
in
the
glorious
undertaking
,
and
publicly
thanked
them
for
the
great
service
they
had
rendered
her
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
not
hesitate
to
declare
,
"
she
said
in
a
loud
voice
,
that
all
might
hear
her
words
,
"
that
by
your
bravery
and
gallantry
you
have
rescued
us
all
from
a
cruel
foe
.
<EOS>
You
have
saved
this
ancient
pile
from
destruction
by
fire
,
and
all
within
its
walls
from
death
,
for
I
would
have
perished
rather
than
yield
,
and
I
know
full
<EOS>
well
you
would
all
have
died
with
me!""We
would
!
<EOS>
"
responded
a
hundred
voices
.
<EOS>
Allowing
these
vociferations
to
subside
,
she
again
addressed
the
officers
.
<EOS>
"Besides
<EOS>
this
mortar
,
"
she
said
,
"
you
have
brought
me
,
I
am
told
,
a
good
supply
of
powder
,
with
several
other
prizes
.
<EOS>
These
I
will
receive
anon
.
<EOS>
Our
first
duty
is
to
Heaven
.
"She
<EOS>
then
proceeded
to
the
chapel
followed
by
all
those
who
had
just
returned
from
the
successful
sortie
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXIVHow
Colonel
Holland
promised
to
bring
Reinforcements
from
ManchesterGREAT
<EOS>
was
the
mortification
of
Rigby
,
when
he
found
that
the
engine
,
with
which
he
had
hoped
to
accomplish
the
destruction
of
Lathom
House
,
had
been
taken
from
him
;
and
additional
sharpness
was
added
to
the
stroke
by
the
fact
that
Colonel
Holland
had
been
invited
to
witness
his
triumph
,
and
had
used
great
despatch
to
arrive
in
time
.
<EOS>
Unable
to
invent
any
excuses
,
Rigby
was
obliged
to
confess
the
truth
—
neither
could
he
conceal
the
fact
that
such
great
discontent
prevailed
among
his
soldiers
,
that
a
mutiny
was
threatened
.
<EOS>
More
than
two
hundred
had
run
away
from
the
trenches
that
morning
,
and
these
added
to
the
large
number
killed
in
the
attack
of
the
Royalists
,
or
malignants
,
as
he
termed
them
,
made
a
very
serious
loss
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
see
how
the
reduction
of
the
garrison
could
now
be
accomplished
,
except
by
starvation
or
want
of
water
.
<EOS>
He
believed
that
their
stock
of
provisions
was
getting
low
,
and
hoped
to
drain
their
well
,
but
so
many
failures
in
his
plans
had
occurred
that
he
did
not
feel
very
sanguine
.
<EOS>
The
siege
might
drag
on
till
the
countess
obtained
<EOS>
assistance
from
the
king
,
or
from
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
who
he
understood
had
quitted
the
Isle
of
Man
,
and
was
now
in
Chester
.
<EOS>
After
thus
explaining
his
position
,
he
requested
Colonel
Holland
to
send
him
an
immediate
reinforcement
from
Manchester
.
<EOS>
"I
want
five
hundred
men
without
delay
to
replace
those
I
have
lost
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
no
longer
equal
to
the
task
given
me
.
<EOS>
The
sorties
of
the
enemy
are
so
frequent
,
that
the
soldiers
are
obliged
to
guard
the
trenches
for
two
nights
running
—
sometimes
more
.
<EOS>
By
this
last
attack
I
have
lost
more
than
two
hundred
of
my
best
men
,
and
at
least
twenty
engineers
.
<EOS>
I
would
fain
have
another
mortar
,
in
order
that
I
may
make
a
fresh
attempt
to
burn
down
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
should
likewise
feel
well
pleased
if
you
would
send
Colonel
Rosworm
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
might
render
me
great
assistance
.
<EOS>
""I
am
unable
to
comply
with
the
latter
request
,
"
replied
Colonel
Holland
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
spoken
to
Rosworm
on
the
subject
,
but
he
absolutely
refuses
to
lend
any
further
aid
against
the
Countess
of
Derby
,
and
does
not
seek
to
disguise
his
hope
that
she
may
be
able
to
hold
out
.
<EOS>
I
will
bring
you
the
five
hundred
men
you
require
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
,
though
their
withdrawal
from
the
Manchester
garrison
will
greatly
reduce
our
strength
—
but
I
can
not
promise
you
another
mortar
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
is
time
this
long
siege
should
be
brought
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
The
heroic
defence
made
by
the
countess
—
for
heroic
it
is
—
is
the
talk
of
the
whole
county
,
and
is
damaging
our
cause
while
it
raises
the
hopes
of
the
malignants
.
<EOS>
We
must
compel
her
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
""I
see
not
how
that
can
be
accomplished
,
"
rejoined
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
tried
every
means
,
but
hitherto
without
success
.
<EOS>
After
the
defeat
of
today
matters
will
become
worse
.
<EOS>
As
I
have
just
explained
to
you
the
soldiers
refuse
to
work
in
the
trenches
,
and
many
of
them
have
taken
to
flight
.
<EOS>
Another
such
month
as
I
have
gone
through
would
compel
me
to
raise
the
siege
.
<EOS>
The
labour
is
beyond
my
strength
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
you
shall
have
the
reinforcement
you
require
,
and
that
speedily
,
"
replied
Colonel
Holland
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
not
relax
in
your
exertions
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
remove
the
demi
-
cannon
and
the
culverin
from
the
batteries
,
or
the
enemy
will
obtain
possession
of
them
next
,
"
said
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"That
will
be
judicious
,
"
rejoined
Colonel
Holland
.
<EOS>
"
The
cannon
can
be
taken
back
again
when
I
arrive
with
the
reinforcement
.
<EOS>
""But
by
that
time
the
batteries
may
be
destroyed
,
"
remarked
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"Others
<EOS>
must
then
be
reared
,
"
said
Colonel
Holland
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
let
the
countess
suppose
you
are
discouraged
.
<EOS>
Keep
up
a
bold
appearance
.
<EOS>
When
I
come
back
we
will
send
her
another
summons
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
we
do
,
she
will
hang
the
messenger
.
<EOS>
""No
,
I
will
take
it
myself
,
"
replied
Colonel
Holland
.
<EOS>
"
Bold
as
she
is
,
she
will
not
venture
to
hang
me
.
<EOS>
""I
am
not
sure
of
it
,
"
said
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
would
as
soon
enter
a
lion
's
den
as
into
her
mansion
.
<EOS>
I
should
expect
to
be
torn
in
pieces
.
<EOS>
She
is
often
on
the
Eagle
Tower
.
<EOS>
I
wish
a
shot
could
reach
her
.
"The
<EOS>
colloquy
then
ended
,
and
Colonel
Holland
set
out
out
on
his
return
to
Manchester

CHAPTER
XXVOf
Asaph
the
Avenger
,
and
the
terrible
Crime
he
committedFOR
three
days
<EOS>
the
besiegers
remained
perfectly
quiet
,
keeping
close
within
the
trenches
,
and
not
firing
a
single
shot
.
<EOS>
Since
they
had
removed
all
their
large
cannon
the
opportunity
seemed
favourable
for
making
another
nocturnal
attack
,
and
accordingly
,
on
the
second
night
,
Captain
Ogle
sallied
forth
with
a
dozen
musketeers
.
<EOS>
He
was
fired
upon
by
a
party
who
were
lying
in
ambush
near
the
postern
-
tower
,
but
sustained
no
damage
,
and
brought
back
more
powder
and
match
,
together
with
a
prisoner
,
who
declared
that
he
possessed
some
intelligence
of
the
utmost
importance
,
but
refused
to
communicate
it
to
any
one
,
save
the
countess
herself
.
<EOS>
This
being
reported
to
her
ladyship
by
Captain
Ogle
,
she
resolved
to
question
him
,
and
he
was
brought
before
her
for
that
purpose
on
the
following
morning
.
<EOS>
The
interrogation
took
place
in
a
room
adjoining
the
great
banquet
-
hall
.
<EOS>
The
prisoner
was
a
strongly
-
built
man
with
harsh
features
,
and
his
closely-
cropped
hair
and
deportment
proclaimed
him
a
rigid
Puritan
.
<EOS>
His
accoutrements
were
a
buff
coat
and
boots
,
but
he
had
been
deprived
of
his
head
-
piece
and
belt
,
and
,
as
was
supposed
,
of
all
weapons
.
<EOS>
He
was
guarded
by
a
couple
of
musketeers
,
who
could
not
force
him
,
even
with
blows
,
to
make
an
obeisance
to
the
countess
.
<EOS>
She
was
seated
in
a
high
-
backed
chair
,
and
on
either
side
of
her
were
her
daughters
,
Gertrude
,
Archdeacon
Rutter
,
Major
Farrington
,
and
Standish
.
<EOS>
The
prisoner
surveyed
the
assemblage
sternly
,
and
slightly
started
when
his
eye
fell
upon
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
The
damsel
had
noticed
him
at
the
same
time
,
and
observed
to
the
countess:"I
recognise
the
man
.
<EOS>
He
calls
himself
Asaph
the
Avenger
,
and
is
accounted
one
of
the
saints
.
<EOS>
He
was
well
known
to
my
father
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
like
not
his
looks
,
"
replied
the
countess
.
"
<EOS>
He
seems
to
me
of
an
evil
disposition
,
and
full
of
hatred
and
malevolence
.
<EOS>
""Such
<EOS>
is
his
character
,
madam
,
"
said
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
I
never
could
endure
him
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
Asaph
,
who
had
hitherto
been
silent
,
lifted
up
his
voice
,
and
addressing
Gertrude
,
said:"What
dost
thou
here
,
in
the
habitation
of
Jezebel
,
thou
daughter
of
a
holy
and
valiant
man
?
<EOS>
It
grieveth
me
to
the
heart
to
find
thee
whom
I
loved
so
well
,
abiding
with
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
""Hold
<EOS>
thy
peace
,
thou
psalm
-
singing
hypocrite
,
"
cried
Captain
Ogle
,
striking
him
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
.
"
<EOS>
Thou
saidst
thou
hadst
important
information
to
give
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
What
is
it?""I
have
to
tell
her
that
Colonel
Holland
,
the
righteous
governor
of
Manchester
,
is
bringing
large
reinforcements
to
Colonel
Rigby
.
<EOS>
She
will
therefore
be
compelled
to
submit
to
the
mercy
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
""Art
<EOS>
thou
a
messenger
from
Rigby
,
fellow
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
countess
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
man
was
taken
prisoner
last
night
in
the
trenches
,
"
said
Captain
Ogle
.
<EOS>
"I
could
easily
have
escaped
,
as
this
officer
can
testify
,
if
he
will
speak
the
truth
,
"
said
Asaph
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
allowed
myself
to
be
captured
,
because
I
desired
to
speak
to
thee
—
to
warn
thee
that
if
thou
dost
continue
to
slaughter
the
saints
,
thou
wilt
be
cut
off
by
a
sudden
and
violent
death
—
thy
soldiers
will
be
slain
—
<EOS>
thine
house
destroyed
,
and
turned
into
a
nest
of
owls
,
and
a
den
of
dragons
.
<EOS>
""Take
him
hence
,
"
cried
the
countess
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
said
I
would
hang
the
next
messenger
sent
to
me
.
<EOS>
This
man
has
dared
to
usurp
the
office
and
shall
not
escape
the
penalty
attached
to
it
.
<EOS>
Take
him
hence
,
and
hang
him
from
the
walls
that
all
his
comrades
may
behold
his
punishment
.
<EOS>
"Before
<EOS>
any
movement
could
be
made
to
execute
this
stern
decree
,
Gertrude
threw
herself
at
the
countess
's
feet
,
and
cried:"Spare
him
,
madam
,
spare
him
,
I
implore
you
!
<EOS>
It
will
more
accord
with
your
noble
character
and
humane
disposition
to
pardon
such
a
miserable
caitiff
than
to
put
him
to
death
.
<EOS>
He
is
beneath
your
resentment
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
words
and
the
tone
in
which
they
were
uttered
produced
an
impression
on
the
countess
,
and
seeing
it
,
Gertrude
arose
and
turning
to
Asaph
,
said:"Down
on
thy
knees
,
rash
man
.
<EOS>
Sue
for
mercy
,
and
thou
shalt
obtain
it
.
<EOS>
""Never
!
"
exclaimed
Asaph
,
resolutely
.
"
<EOS>
Never
will
I
bend
knee
to
Jezebel
.
<EOS>
I
came
not
to
her
to
sue
for
mercy
,
but
to
tax
her
with
her
crimes
,
and
warn
her
of
her
end
.
<EOS>
Her
punishment
is
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Deeply
hath
she
sinned
against
the
Lord
and
she
shall
die
.
<EOS>
I
have
pronounced
her
doom
.
<EOS>
The
servants
of
the
Lord
are
in
array
against
her
.
<EOS>
The
broad
walls
of
Babylon
shall
be
utterly
broken
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
finished
speaking
,
he
drew
forth
a
pistol
,
which
he
had
contrived
to
conceal
in
his
accoutrements
,
and
levelled
it
at
the
countess
.
<EOS>
So
sudden
was
the
act
that
neither
the
musketeers
nor
Captain
Ogle
could
prevent
him
from
discharging
the
weapon
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
the
shot
would
have
been
fatal
if
Gertrude
,
who
had
watched
him
narrowly
,
and
divined
his
purpose
,
had
not
placed
herself
before
her
noble
mistress
,
and
received
in
her
breast
the
bullet
intended
for
her
—
thus
preserving
the
countess
's
life
at
the
sacrifice
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
IllustrationA
cry
of
horror
burst
from
all
around
.
<EOS>
Rising
from
her
seat
at
the
moment
,
Lady
Derby
caught
her
preserver
in
her
arms
,
while
the
young
ladies
Stanley
crowded
round
eager
to
render
aid
.
<EOS>
The
wretch
who
had
done
the
dreadful
deed
,
looked
on
aghast
—
his
features
expressing
the
most
terrible
mental
anguish
.
<EOS>
"I
meant
not
to
kill
her
,
"
he
cried
,
almost
piteously
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
died
rather
than
harm
her
.
<EOS>
Let
me
obtain
her
forgiveness
,
and
I
will
go
with
you
to
instant
death
.
<EOS>
""Thou
shalt
go
to
instant
death
,
thou
execrable
assassin
,
"
cried
Captain
Ogle
,
"
but
without
the
forgiveness
of
thy
innocent
victim
,
that
thy
soul
may
be
sent
to
the
perdition
thou
so
justly
meritest
.
<EOS>
"Asaph
<EOS>
made
no
further
resistance
,
but
was
hurried
by
the
musketeers
to
the
small
court
at
the
back
of
the
chapel
,
where
it
may
be
remembered
a
wall
had
been
knocked
down
by
a
grenado
.
<EOS>
They
were
followed
by
Major
Farrington
and
Captain
Ogle
.
<EOS>
At
the
door
of
the
chapel
they
met
Doctor
Brideoake
,
who
wished
to
pray
with
the
murderer
,
but
the
wretched
man
sternly
rejected
the
kindly
offer
.
<EOS>
Though
the
party
moved
on
as
quickly
as
possible
,
they
were
joined
by
several
other
musketeers
and
some
of
the
servants
,
whose
maledictions
Asaph
had
to
bear
.
<EOS>
But
he
seemed
insensible
to
them
,
and
entirely
occupied
by
silent
prayer
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
their
destination
the
two
musketeers
,
who
had
never
quitted
their
hold
of
the
prisoner
,
took
him
to
the
further
end
of
the
little
court
.
<EOS>
Captain
Ogle
then
bade
him
take
off
his
buff
coat
and
kneel
down
,
and
again
asked
if
the
chaplain
should
pray
with
him
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
do
not
desire
to
destroy
thy
soul
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
The
offer
was
rejected
as
sternly
as
before
,
but
the
murderer
begged
to
be
allowed
a
few
minutes
to
make
his
peace
with
Heaven
.
<EOS>
This
was
granted
,
and
the
musketeers
stayed
by
him
till
he
had
stripped
off
his
accoutrements
.
<EOS>
They
then
withdrew
,
and
joined
their
comrades
,
who
now
numbered
nearly
a
score
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
court
.
<EOS>
The
wretch
then
knelt
down
,
and
after
passing
a
few
minutes
in
earnest
supplication
,
held
up
his
hands
.
<EOS>
At
the
signal
,
more
than
a
dozen
muskets
were
fired
,
and
the
assassin
fell
with
his
face
to
the
ground
,
his
body
being
completely
riddled
with
shot
.
<EOS>
None
pitied
him
,
but
several
spurned
the
bleeding
carcase
,
as
they
would
a
dead
dog
.

CHAPTER
XXVIOf
Gertrude
's
last
Parting
with
StandishMEANWHILE
,
the
wounded
damsel
had
been
carefully
transported
to
her
own
chamber
,
and
laid
upon
the
small
bed
with
which
it
was
furnished
.
<EOS>
When
Master
Holbrook
,
the
surgeon
of
the
garrison
,
and
a
man
of
great
skill
,
entered
the
room
,
she
had
become
insensible
,
and
the
countess
and
her
daughters
,
who
,
with
Archdeacon
Rutter
,
were
the
only
persons
present
,
almost
feared
she
had
expired
.
<EOS>
No
pulsation
could
be
felt
by
the
countess
,
who
had
placed
her
hand
on
the
luckless
damsel
's
wrist
.
<EOS>
How
beautiful
she
looked
even
under
these
sad
circumstances
!
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
closed
,
and
the
colour
had
fled
from
her
cheeks
,
but
the
exquisite
outline
of
her
features
was
perfectly
preserved
.
<EOS>
Her
fair
tresses
having
become
unbound
,
streamed
on
the
couch
.
<EOS>
Even
the
surgeon
,
who
was
rarely
touched
by
such
spectacles
,
was
greatly
moved
.
<EOS>
On
examining
the
wound
,
he
found
—
as
indeed
was
apparent
—
that
it
bled
internally
,
and
his
grave
looks
announced
that
he
deemed
it
fatal
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
she
gone
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
countess
,
in
broken
accents
.
<EOS>
"No
,
madam
,
"
replied
Holbrook
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
revive
her
,
but
it
will
only
be
for
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
then
poured
a
few
drops
from
a
phial
upon
a
small
piece
of
linen
,
and
applied
it
to
her
lips
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
to
the
amazement
of
all
the
observers
,
who
had
watched
the
result
of
the
experiment
with
the
utmost
anxiety
,
symptoms
of
returning
animation
were
perceptible
.
<EOS>
Opening
her
eyes
,
the
ill
-
fated
damsel
fixed
them
upon
the
countess
,
who
was
still
standing
near
her
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
she
did
not
seem
to
comprehend
her
situation
,
but
soon
the
terrible
truth
rushed
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Slightly
raising
herself
,
she
gazed
earnestly
and
inquiringly
at
the
surgeon
,
whom
she
recognised
,
and
finding
he
did
not
speak
,
said
in
a
low
,
but
firm
voice:"Tell
me
!
<EOS>
tell
me
truly
!
<EOS>
Am
I
wounded
to
death?""You
are
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
Then
,
without
manifesting
any
fear
,
she
asked
in
the
same
firm
tone:"How
long
<EOS>
have
I
to
live
?
<EOS>
Do
not
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
may
live
half
an
hour
—
not
longer
,
"
was
the
answer
,
pronounced
very
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
Drink
from
this
phial
,
"
he
added
,
presenting
it
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
Tis
a
sovereign
elixir
,
and
will
help
to
sustain
you
.
"She
eagerly
swallowed
a
few
drops
,
and
returned
the
phial
to
him
.
<EOS>
"That
is
all
I
can
do
,
madam
,
"
observed
Holbrook
to
the
countess
,
as
he
stepped
back
and
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
Forcibly
repressing
the
emotion
,
by
which
she
was
well
-
nigh
overcome
,
the
countess
bent
down
,
and
kissed
the
brow
of
the
dying
maiden
.
<EOS>
"Oh
!
<EOS>
how
can
I
thank
you
!
<EOS>
You
have
rendered
me
many
great
services
—
but
this
is
the
greatest
of
all
,
"
she
cried
,
in
a
voice
broken
by
emotion
.
<EOS>
"It
is
the
last
service
I
shall
ever
render
your
ladyship
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
done
no
more
than
my
duty
—
no
more
than
any
of
your
soldiers
would
have
done
for
you
!
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
single
person
in
this
castle
,
who
would
not
gladly
have
sacrificed
his
life
to
save
yours
!
<EOS>
Farewell
,
madam
—
farewell
for
ever
!
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
when
all
else
has
become
indifferent
to
me
,
I
am
gladdened
by
the
thought
that
you
will
triumph
over
your
enemies
.
<EOS>
Think
of
me
,
I
pray
you
,
in
the
hour
of
victory!""Doubt
it
not
,
"
cried
the
countess
.
"
<EOS>
But
for
you
I
should
never
have
gained
a
victory
.
<EOS>
""Enough
,
"
rejoined
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
now
die
content
.
<EOS>
"She
<EOS>
then
looked
at
the
young
ladies
Stanley
,
who
were
gazing
tearfully
on
the
scene
,
and
signed
to
them
to
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
know
how
dearly
I
have
loved
you
,
"
she
exclaimed
,
holding
out
her
arms
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Kiss
me
all
of
you
,
I
entreat
you
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
press
you
to
my
breast
as
I
long
to
do
,
but
while
life
lasts
you
will
be
next
my
heart
.
"Approaching
<EOS>
singly
,
each
tenderly
embraced
her
.
<EOS>
As
they
withdrew
,
Archdeacon
Rutter
came
forward
,
and
said:"You
have
now
done
with
the
world
,
and
must
turn
your
thoughts
to
Heaven
.
<EOS>
""I
have
not
quite
done
with
the
world
,
dear
and
reverend
sir
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
one
other
person
to
whom
I
would
bid
farewell
,
ere
I
depart
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
mean
Captain
Standish
,
"
observed
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
see
him
alone?""I
would
,
"
replied
the
dying
damsel
.
<EOS>
"I
will
send
him
to
you
instantly
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
And
signing
to
the
others
to
follow
her
,
she
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
Standish
entered
,
evidently
quite
overcome
by
grief
.
<EOS>
"Can
<EOS>
you
forgive
me
?
<EOS>
"
he
cried
,
taking
the
hand
she
extended
to
him
,
and
pressing
it
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"I
have
not
waited
for
this
moment
to
forgive
you
,
"
she
rejoined
,
fixing
her
gaze
tenderly
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
have
preferred
another
,
and
when
I
first
made
the
discovery
I
thought
my
heart
would
break
—
nay
,
I
even
meditated
revenge
,
and
there
were
moments
when
I
was
so
maddened
by
jealousy
that
I
could
have
stabbed
my
rival
.
<EOS>
But
those
feelings
have
long
since
ceased
.
<EOS>
I
love
you
still
—
but
it
is
with
a
holy
,
sisterly
love
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
doubt
what
I
say
,
since
I
tell
it
you
with
my
dying
breath
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
not
doubt
it
,
"
cried
Standish
,
in
a
voice
of
anguish
.
<EOS>
"
Though
you
pardon
me
,
I
can
never
pardon
myself
.
<EOS>
""Think
<EOS>
no
more
of
me
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Let
no
remembrance
of
me
mar
your
future
happiness
.
<EOS>
Heaven
never
intended
I
should
be
your
wife
,
and
though
I
have
reconciled
myself
to
my
hard
destiny
,
I
feel
this
death
is
a
boon
to
me
,
and
has
saved
me
much
suffering
.
<EOS>
May
you
be
happy
with
Engracia!"The
effort
was
too
much
,
and
she
sank
back
upon
the
pillow
.
<EOS>
Standish
thought
all
was
over
,
and
with
difficulty
repressed
a
cry
.
<EOS>
After
remaining
quiet
for
a
few
moments
she
again
spoke
.
<EOS>
"One
<EOS>
thing
distresses
me
greatly
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
see
my
father
—
I
can
not
receive
his
blessing
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
see
him
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
I
thought
of
him
,
and
reproached
myself
that
I
have
not
adequately
requited
his
strong
affection
for
me
.
<EOS>
Heaven
,
therefore
,
has
denied
me
his
blessing
.
<EOS>
""I
will
tell
him
what
you
say
,
"
cried
Standish
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
any
further
injunction
for
me?""Should
you
behold
my
father
again
,
give
him
this
necklace
,
"
she
said
,
taking
off
a
little
string
of
beads
;
"
and
now
,
farewell
for
ever!"Seeing
<EOS>
she
was
sinking
,
Standish
flew
to
open
the
door
,
and
in
another
moment
the
countess
and
her
daughters
were
kneeling
by
the
bedside
.
<EOS>
She
beheld
them
not
,
for
her
eyes
were
closed
,
but
she
heard
them
,
and
breathed
their
names
.
<EOS>
They
were
followed
by
Archdeacon
Rutter
,
who
likewise
knelt
down
with
Standish
,
and
recited
the
prayer
for
the
dying
.
<EOS>
But
ere
it
was
ended
her
spirit
had
passed
away
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
XXVIIHow
the
Soldiers
of
the
Garrison
looked
their
last
on
their
FavouriteNo
event
had
occurred
during
the
siege
that
caused
such
a
painful
sensation
as
the
death
of
Gertrude
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
Next
to
the
countess
herself
,
no
one
was
more
universally
beloved
than
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
Her
beauty
,
her
courage
,
her
devotion
made
her
the
pride
of
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
All
the
officers
were
secretly
in
love
with
her
,
though
she
favoured
none
of
them
.
<EOS>
The
men
adored
her
,
and
whenever
she
appeared
among
them
,
they
testified
their
delight
.
<EOS>
To
catch
sight
of
her
figure
on
the
parade
,
on
the
Eagle
Tower
,
or
in
the
chapel
,
was
always
a
gratification
to
them
.
<EOS>
To
be
thus
deprived
of
their
favourite
by
the
hand
of
an
assassin
was
a
blow
that
all
felt
severely
;
but
if
anything
could
mitigate
their
regret
,
it
was
that
she
had
saved
the
countess
.
<EOS>
However
,
on
that
melancholy
day
,
the
garrison
presented
a
very
different
aspect
from
what
it
usually
wore
.
<EOS>
Sorrow
was
depicted
on
every
manly
countenance
.
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
Stanley
were
overwhelmed
with
grief
,
and
Lady
Derby
suffered
deeply
.
<EOS>
In
compliance
with
the
earnest
wishes
of
the
soldiers
expressed
through
their
officers
,
they
were
allowed
to
behold
their
favourite
once
more
.
<EOS>
Placed
on
a
bier
,
in
the
attire
worn
when
she
met
her
fate
,
the
body
of
the
unfortunate
damsel
was
conveyed
to
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
It
was
partly
covered
by
a
black
velvet
mantle
which
served
as
a
pall
,
but
the
face
and
upper
part
of
the
person
could
be
seen
.
<EOS>
As
yet
the
features
had
lost
none
of
their
beauty
—
<EOS>
nay
,
perhaps
they
looked
more
beautiful
than
in
life
—
at
least
,
the
beholders
thought
so
,
and
the
striking
spectacle
was
never
effaced
from
their
remembrance
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
officers
were
stationed
at
the
door
of
the
chapel
,
and
others
inside
,
while
Archdeacon
Rutter
and
Docter
Brideoake
were
likewise
present
.
<EOS>
The
musketeers
came
in
singly
,
but
lingered
not
.
<EOS>
After
gazing
for
an
instant
at
the
lovely
and
now
placid
features
of
the
dead
,
each
passed
on
.
<EOS>
It
was
touching
to
see
how
deeply
these
stout
-
hearted
men
were
moved
.
<EOS>
For
the
time
they
repressed
their
grief
,
but
gave
vent
to
it
when
they
left
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
All
the
garrison
,
at
intervals
when
the
men
could
quit
their
posts
,
came
to
look
their
last
on
their
favourite
.
<EOS>
The
body
remained
there
till
evening
,
when
it
was
taken
back
to
the
house
,
and
placed
in
a
coffin
that
had
been
prepared
for
it
.
<EOS>
At
midnight
it
was
brought
back
again
to
the
chapel
,
where
the
funeral
rites
were
performed
by
Archdeacon
Rutter
in
the
presence
of
the
countess
and
her
daughters
,
the
officers
,
and
a
great
part
of
the
household
,
both
male
and
female
.
<EOS>
Many
tears
were
shed
on
this
sad
occasion
.
<EOS>
The
body
was
then
deposited
in
a
vault
beneath
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
XXVIIIHow
a
Letter
was
brought
to
the
Countess
from
her
HusbandIT
<EOS>
was
quite
a
relief
to
the
men
,
after
this
depressing
event
,
to
be
actively
engaged
against
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Holland
had
arrived
with
his
reinforcements
from
Manchester
,
and
the
ranks
of
those
who
had
been
killed
,
or
had
disbanded
themselves
,
were
filled
up
.
<EOS>
Batteries
and
fortifications
were
once
more
occupied
,
and
mounted
with
cannon
,
and
presented
a
very
formidable
appearance
.
<EOS>
Everything
showed
that
the
Leaguer
was
greatly
strengthened
,
and
would
be
maintained
till
the
besieged
were
completely
worn
out
,
either
by
starvation
,
want
of
water
,
or
want
of
ammunition
.
<EOS>
The
countess
had
been
told
that
her
husband
had
quitted
the
Isle
of
Man
,
but
she
had
not
heard
direct
from
him
,
for
of
late
no
messenger
had
been
able
to
enter
the
castle
.
<EOS>
But
a
few
days
after
the
arrival
of
Colonel
Holland
,
when
the
Leaguer
,
as
we
said
,
had
become
greatly
strengthened
,
a
man
named
Linacre
contrived
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
the
sentinels
,
and
was
admitted
at
the
postern
-
gate
.
<EOS>
He
brought
a
letter
for
the
countess
rolled
in
lead
,
which
he
declared
was
from
the
earl
,
her
husband
,
and
so
it
proved
.
<EOS>
The
letter
informed
her
that
he
had
arrived
safely
at
Chester
.
<EOS>
The
garrison
there
was
commanded
by
Lord
Molineux
,
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
,
Richard
Grosvenor
,
and
other
Cavaliers
,
but
they
were
unable
to
come
to
her
assistance
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
,
however
,
had
hopes
of
aid
from
Prince
Rupert
,
who
had
succeeded
in
raising
the
siege
of
Newark
,
and
was
about
to
march
to
York
with
ten
thousand
men
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
conjured
the
prince
,
"
he
said
,
"
to
march
through
Lancashire
and
lend
you
succour
,
and
I
trust
he
will
comply
with
my
request
.
<EOS>
Were
his
highness
so
disposed
,
he
could
raise
the
siege
of
Lathom
House
in
two
days
,
and
inflict
such
a
blow
on
the
enemy
,
as
must
needs
bring
to
us
all
the
well
-
affected
in
the
county
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
seen
the
prince
,
for
I
have
much
to
do
here
,
and
am
striving
to
get
together
two
or
three
hundred
men
.
<EOS>
I
want
money
,
and
though
I
like
it
not
,
your
jewels
must
be
sold
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
a
most
critical
juncture
,
and
if
I
fail
now
,
all
may
be
lost
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
lord
shall
have
my
jewels
,
"
said
the
countess
,
as
she
read
this
portion
of
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
But
how
convey
them
to
him
?
<EOS>
I
must
send
Standish
.
<EOS>
He
is
the
only
person
,
who
can
be
relied
upon
in
such
an
emergency
.
"She
<EOS>
then
gave
some
orders
to
an
attendant
,
and
proceeded
to
her
cabinet
,
where
Standish
,
who
had
been
summoned
by
the
servant
,
joined
her
.
<EOS>
He
saw
she
had
something
of
importance
to
communicate
to
him
.
<EOS>
"You
are
aware
that
I
have
just
received
a
letter
from
my
lord
,
"
she
began
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
at
Chester
with
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
He
wants
money
,
but
as
all
his
property
has
been
sequestered
,
he
can
obtain
none
.
<EOS>
I
would
fain
send
him
my
jewels
,
which
are
worth
five
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
Will
you
convey
them
to
him?""I
will
,
madam
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
The
task
is
difficult
and
dangerous
,
but
I
doubt
not
I
can
accomplish
it
.
<EOS>
""You
must
take
half
a
dozen
men
with
you
.
""Not
<EOS>
so
,
madam
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
That
would
be
to
invite
attack
,
and
then
I
might
be
robbed
of
the
treasure
.
<EOS>
Alone
,
or
with
a
single
attendant
,
I
shall
run
comparatively
little
risk
.
<EOS>
""You
are
right
,
"
said
the
countess
,
approvingly
.
<EOS>
"
Linacre
,
the
man
who
brought
this
letter
from
my
lord
,
may
be
useful
to
you
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
passed
through
the
trenches
.
<EOS>
""I
had
already
thought
of
him
,
"
rejoined
Standish
.
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
he
will
be
very
useful
.
<EOS>
I
have
conversed
with
him
,
and
like
his
manner
.
<EOS>
He
looks
like
an
honest
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
will
promise
him
a
good
reward
,
if
he
conducts
me
safely
through
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
that
will
tempt
him
.
<EOS>
If
it
suits
your
ladyship
,
I
will
start
on
the
expedition
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
""You
are
ever
prompt
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
jewels
shall
be
ready
for
you
.
<EOS>
Stay
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
glancing
again
at
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
more
here
that
I
have
not
read
.
<EOS>
My
lord
,
I
find
,
bids
me
send
you
with
the
jewels
.
<EOS>
So
far
well
.
<EOS>
But
he
likewise
wishes
you
to
halt
at
Knowsley
till
you
hear
from
him
.
<EOS>
Perchance
,
he
may
meet
you
there
.
<EOS>
""His
<EOS>
orders
shall
be
obeyed
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
particularly
agreeable
to
me
to
make
halt
at
Knowsley
,
as
I
shall
have
a
chance
of
seeing
Don
Fortunio
and
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
you
may
meet
them
,
and
I
beg
you
will
remember
me
most
heartily
to
them
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
Standish
then
withdrew
to
prepare
for
the
expedition
,
and
confer
with
his
proposed
attendant
,
Tom
Linacre
.
<EOS>
Linacre
undertook
to
get
him
safely
across
the
trenches
,
and
past
the
fortifications
,
after
which
Standish
felt
certain
he
could
make
his
way
through
the
camp
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
with
the
arrangement
,
he
returned
to
the
countess
,
who
gave
him
three
cases
,
containing
the
jewels
.
<EOS>
"These
shall
be
securely
placed
beneath
my
cuirass
,
madam
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
shall
never
be
taken
from
me
while
I
live
.

"CHAPTER
<EOS>
XXIXHow
Standish
encountered
RoswormSOME
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
bell
tolled
midnight
,
the
sentinels
of
the
besiegers
stationed
on
the
fortifications
near
the
postern
-
tower
were
alarmed
by
seeing
a
long
line
of
lights
suddenly
appear
before
them
,
and
at
once
fired
in
the
direction
,
not
suspecting
that
the
lights
they
beheld
were
a
device
contrived
by
Captain
Chisenhale
to
distract
their
attention
from
Standish
's
departure
.
<EOS>
Roused
by
the
shots
,
their
comrades
apprehending
an
attack
,
quickly
joined
them
,
and
likewise
fired
,
and
some
time
elapsed
before
they
discovered
that
a
cord
hung
with
lighted
matches
,
and
tied
to
the
stump
of
a
tree
,
had
deluded
them
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Standish
and
his
attendant
,
both
well
-
mounted
and
well
-
armed
,
sallied
forth
from
the
great
gate
,
and
managed
to
get
across
the
trench
at
a
point
that
Linacre
had
noted
,
without
causing
alarm
till
they
were
both
safe
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
Some
muskets
were
then
fired
at
them
,
but
they
were
soon
out
of
reach
,
and
galloping
towards
the
camp
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
so
dark
that
scarcely
any
object
could
be
discerned
,
but
Standish
fancied
he
could
distinguish
a
horseman
approaching
them
.
<EOS>
Whether
he
was
alone
,
or
followed
by
a
small
troop
,
could
not
be
made
out
,
but
Standish
went
boldly
on
.
<EOS>
"Who
goes
there
?
"
demanded
the
horseman
.
<EOS>
"A
friend
,
"
replied
Standish
,
slackening
his
pace
,
for
he
now
felt
certain
the
person
was
alone
,
and
had
made
up
his
mind
to
shoot
him
if
he
offered
any
hindrance
.
<EOS>
"I
heard
firing
at
the
trenches
,
and
was
going
thither
,
"
said
the
new
-
comer
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
changed
my
mind
,
and
will
return
with
you
to
the
camp
.
<EOS>
"Standish
made
no
reply
to
the
proposition
,
but
drew
a
pistol
from
the
holster
,
resolved
to
disembarrass
himself
of
his
enforced
companion
.
<EOS>
The
horseman
perceived
the
action
,
but
without
betraying
the
slightest
fear
,
said:"You
call
yourself
a
friend
,
but
you
are
about
to
treat
me
as
an
enemy
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
the
enemy
of
Captain
Standish
.
<EOS>
My
eyes
are
sharper
than
yours
.
<EOS>
I
knew
you
at
once
.
<EOS>
""Your
voice
is
familiar
to
me
,
"
replied
the
young
man
.
"
<EOS>
Can
it
be
<EOS>
Colonel
Rosworm?""It
<EOS>
is
that
most
unhappy
man
,
"
said
the
other
,
in
a
mournful
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
losing
my
daughter
I
have
lost
all
that
was
dear
to
me
on
earth
.
<EOS>
Many
hours
have
not
flown
since
I
heard
of
her
death
,
and
I
came
here
at
once
.
<EOS>
""With
<EOS>
what
intent
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Standish
,
struck
by
his
manner
.
<EOS>
"To
die
!
"
replied
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
Since
I
have
lost
her
,
I
have
no
desire
to
live
.
<EOS>
I
shall
find
the
death
I
seek
from
the
cannon
of
Lathom
House
.
<EOS>
""This
is
the
madness
of
grief
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
throw
your
life
away
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
for
you
,
that
may
yield
you
comfort
,
and
deter
you
from
your
fatal
purpose
.
<EOS>
Almost
with
her
dying
breath
,
she
prayed
me
give
you
this
string
of
beads
.
<EOS>
Little
did
I
deem
that
I
should
so
soon
be
able
to
fulfil
her
wishes
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
as
he
spoke
,
he
took
the
necklace
from
the
small
leather
bag
attached
to
his
girdle
,
and
gave
it
Rosworm
,
who
pressed
it
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
know
it
well
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
gave
it
her
when
a
child
.
<EOS>
Truly
,
this
will
be
a
great
comfort
to
me
.
<EOS>
"Then
overcoming
his
emotion
by
a
powerful
effort
,
he
added:"Tell
me
where
she
lies!""In
a
vault
beneath
the
little
chapel
of
the
mansion
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
All
the
garrison
mourned
for
her
.
<EOS>
The
countess
,
no
doubt
,
will
deliver
up
the
body
to
you
,
should
you
desire
it
.
<EOS>
""No
,
I
will
not
disturb
her
,
"
said
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
must
separate
.
<EOS>
We
are
near
the
camp
.
<EOS>
""Farewell
,
then
!
"
cried
Standish
,
preparing
to
dash
forward
.
<EOS>
"Stay
!
"
cried
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
run
great
risk
of
capture
.
<EOS>
I
can
help
you
to
pass
through
the
camp,"Quickening
their
pace
,
they
were
presently
challenged
by
the
sentinels
,
to
whom
Rosworm
called
out
,
upon
which
they
were
allowed
to
pass
.
<EOS>
The
camp
seemed
buried
in
slumber
,
and
was
very
negligently
watched
,
probably
because
so
many
men
had
been
sent
to
the
trenches
.
<EOS>
No
sentinels
were
near
any
of
the
tents
,
nor
did
the
party
encounter
a
single
patrol
.
<EOS>
Rosworm
did
not
quit
his
friend
till
he
had
brought
him
to
the
wood
that
skirted
the
back
of
the
camp
.
<EOS>
He
then
bade
him
farewell
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
shall
not
tarry
here
,
"
he
said
,
"
since
you
have
induced
me
to
change
my
design
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
sympathy
with
Rigby
,
and
I
hope
the
Earl
of
Derby
may
come
speedily
and
raise
the
siege
of
his
castle
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
then
rode
back
,
while
Standish
plunged
into
the
wood
followed
by
Linacre
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
XXXHow
Standish
found
Engracia
at
KnowsleyPERFECTLY
well
acquainted
with
the
country
,
Standish
had
no
difficulty
in
making
his
way
through
the
wood
,
nor
in
traversing
the
broad
moors
and
avoiding
the
dangerous
morasses
that
lay
between
him
and
his
destination
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
meet
with
any
foraging
party
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
It
gladdened
him
,
however
,
to
quit
this
wild
and
uncultivated
district
,
and
enter
Knowsley
Park
,
which
though
sequestered
by
the
Parliament
had
not
been
disturbed
.
<EOS>
Not
knowing
whether
the
house
was
occupied
by
the
enemy
,
though
he
believed
they
had
altogether
abandoned
it
,
he
proceeded
to
the
stables
,
and
succeeded
in
rousing
a
groom
,
who
took
charge
of
the
horses
,
and
relieved
him
of
his
anxiety
as
to
the
Roundheads
by
telling
him
they
had
all
gone
to
the
camp
at
Lathom
.
<EOS>
After
a
time
,
he
obtained
admittance
to
the
mansion
,
and
was
conducted
by
a
serving
-
man
to
a
chamber
,
where
he
found
a
large
and
comfortable
bed
.
<EOS>
Before
lying
down
to
slumber
,
he
placed
the
jewel
cases
under
the
pillow
.
<EOS>
Captain
Standish
had
been
so
long
accustomed
to
the
garrison
reveillé
,
that
not
hearing
the
early
beat
of
the
drum
,
he
slept
on
to
a
much
later
hour
than
usual
,
and
was
at
last
awakened
by
the
entrance
of
old
Randal
Fermor
,
the
steward
,
who
had
been
informed
of
his
arrival
by
the
groom
,
and
came
to
see
what
he
could
do
for
him
.
<EOS>
"Little
<EOS>
did
I
expect
to
see
you
here
,
sir
,
"
said
Randal
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
would
never
have
quitted
Lathom
.
<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
should
I
unless
I
had
a
mission
to
perform
for
the
countess
,
"
replied
Standish
.
"
<EOS>
But
tell
me
!
<EOS>
Are
Don
Fortunio
and
his
daughter
still
here
?
<EOS>
We
have
heard
nothing
of
them
of
late
,
and
the
countess
has
been
very
anxious
for
their
safety
.
<EOS>
""Yes
,
they
are
here
,
"
replied
Randal
,
"
and
as
comfortable
as
circumstances
will
permit
.
<EOS>
Having
a
warrant
from
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
authorising
him
to
occupy
certain
apartments
in
the
mansion
,
Don
Fortunio
has
never
been
disturbed
.
<EOS>
For
the
last
month
we
have
not
been
troubled
by
the
enemy
,
and
the
troop
of
horse
that
was
quartered
here
has
been
removed
to
the
Leaguer
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
sir
,
do
you
think
our
brave
lady
will
be
able
to
hold
out
?
<EOS>
I
am
told
Colonel
Holland
has
brought
large
reinforcements
from
Manchester
.
<EOS>
""That
is
true
,
"
replied
Standish
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
hope
and
believe
the
Earl
of
Derby
himself
will
come
to
her
aid
,
and
raise
the
siege
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
<EOS>
grant
he
may
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Randal
.
<EOS>
"
Were
he
to
show
himself
,
I
am
sure
hundreds
would
flock
to
his
standard
.
<EOS>
""Have
<EOS>
you
heard
from
his
lordship
,
Randal
?
"
demanded
Standish
.
<EOS>
"A
week
ago
there
came
a
messenger
from
Chester
,
who
told
me
that
his
lordship
had
returned
,
and
wished
to
ascertain
whether
Knowsley
was
still
occupied
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
as
I
have
just
told
you
,
that
they
have
completely
evacuated
it
,
and
that
his
lordship
could
come
hither
,
if
he
pleased
,
with
safety
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
may
expect
him
,
Randal
,
but
of
course
he
will
come
secretly
.
<EOS>
""When
<EOS>
I
heard
of
your
arrival
,
I
thought
at
first
'
twas
he
,
"
said
the
old
steward
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
now
leave
you
—
unless
you
require
my
assistance
.
<EOS>
Breakfast
shall
be
prepared
for
you
in
the
great
hall
.
"He
<EOS>
then
left
the
chamber
,
and
Standish
arose
.
<EOS>
Before
accoutring
himself
,
he
ascertained
that
the
jewel
cases
were
safe
.
<EOS>
Linacre
made
his
appearance
in
time
to
buckle
on
his
corslet
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
know
not
how
long
I
shall
remain
here
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
But
hold
yourself
in
readiness
for
instant
departure
.
"Linacre
<EOS>
promised
obedience
.
<EOS>
The
apartment
Standish
had
occupied
was
situated
in
the
great
gallery
,
which
now
seemed
completely
deserted
,
though
it
had
not
been
robbed
of
the
noble
family
portraits
that
adorned
it
.
<EOS>
As
he
marched
along
he
perceived
Maria
in
the
distance
.
<EOS>
She
instantly
recognised
him
,
and
uttering
a
cry
of
delight
,
flew
towards
him
,
and
kissed
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"Oh
!
<EOS>
how
delighted
the
señorita
will
be
to
learn
you
are
come
at
last
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
been
quite
in
despair
,
but
will
now
revive
.
<EOS>
She
has
never
ceased
to
regret
that
she
left
Lathom
House
.
<EOS>
"All
<EOS>
this
was
spoken
in
Spanish
,
but
her
hearer
quite
understood
it
,
and
made
the
best
reply
he
could
.
<EOS>
"Tell
<EOS>
her
<EOS>
I
am
most
anxious
to
see
her
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
arrived
here
last
night
,
and
may
not
remain
long
.
<EOS>
I
am
now
going
down
to
breakfast
in
the
banqueting
-
hall
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
will
join
me
there""I
<EOS>
am
sure
she
will
,
"
cried
Maria
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
not
yet
left
her
room
.
<EOS>
But
she
will
come
to
you
as
soon
as
she
can
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
she
will
thank
me
for
my
good
news!"And
<EOS>
she
hurried
off
to
convey
it
,
while
Standish
descended
the
magnificent
staircase
,
and
proceeded
to
the
banqueting
-
hall
.
<EOS>
One
or
two
persons
were
to
be
seen
in
this
vast
apartment
,
which
used
formerly
to
be
thronged
with
serving
-
men
and
guests
.
<EOS>
These
were
Randal
Fermor
and
another
servant
who
were
spreading
a
cloth
at
the
upper
end
of
the
long
oak
table
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
has
occurred
to
me
that
your
honour
may
like
to
breakfast
with
your
friends
,
"
said
Randal
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
arrange
it
so?""By
all
means
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
So
great
was
his
impatience
to
behold
Engracia
that
he
thought
it
an
age
before
she
appeared
with
Maria
,
though
in
reality
not
many
minutes
had
flown
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
rapturous
meeting
,
for
the
frank
-
hearted
Spanish
damsel
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
her
delight
,
and
her
lover
could
not
repress
his
ardour
.
<EOS>
As
he
held
her
hand
,
and
gazed
into
her
splendid
black
eyes
,
he
thought
her
looking
more
beautiful
than
ever
,
and
told
her
so
with
a
warmth
that
left
no
doubt
of
his
sincerity
.
<EOS>
Their
first
transports
over
,
they
proceeded
to
the
further
end
of
the
hall
,
where
their
discourse
would
be
unheard
,
for
he
had
much
to
say
to
her
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
he
had
to
assure
the
lovely
mistress
of
his
heart
that
his
devotion
was
unaltered
,
and
,
if
possible
,
stronger
than
ever
,
while
she
declared
that
he
had
never
for
a
single
moment
been
absent
from
her
thoughts
.
<EOS>
"I
have
had
nothing
else
to
do
but
think
of
you
,
caro
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
pray
that
you
would
soon
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
thought
of
you
at
all
times
,
and
in
all
places
,
but
especially
on
the
lake
.
<EOS>
Our
separation
has
been
so
long
,
that
I
sometimes
began
to
fear
I
should
never
behold
you
again
—
and
that
fear
almost
broke
my
heart
.
<EOS>
But
at
last
you
are
come
.
<EOS>
I
behold
you
again
,
and
nothing
can
equal
my
bliss
.
<EOS>
Promise
not
to
leave
me
,
or
I
shall
become
miserable
again
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
deceive
you
,
my
beloved
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
would
give
me
so
much
delight
as
to
stay
with
you
—
nothing
will
pain
me
more
than
to
quit
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
my
own
master
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
left
Lathom
House
—
I
should
not
have
deserted
the
countess
,
had
she
not
sent
me
on
a
special
mission
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
here
to
meet
the
Earl
of
Derby
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
it
is
not
to
see
me
that
you
have
come
—
as
I
fondly
persuaded
myself
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
somewhat
piqued
.
<EOS>
"Duty
has
the
first
claim
upon
me
,
dearest
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
obey
her
call
.
<EOS>
""Yes
,
I
have
no
right
to
complain
.
<EOS>
But
it
will
be
very
—
very
hard
to
lose
you
.
"
<EOS>
Then
controlling
her
emotion
,
she
added
,
"
When
do
you
expect
the
Earl
of
Derby?""I
know
not
,
"
he
rejoined
.
"
<EOS>
He
may
arrive
at
any
moment
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
he
will
come
secretly
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
take
you
with
him
when
he
does
come
.
<EOS>
""It
may
be
so
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
likely
I
shall
remain
here
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
give
me
no
hope?""Alas
!
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
My
own
idea
is
that
his
lordship
has
some
important
task
for
me
to
execute
,
and
that
I
must
set
about
it
forthwith
.
<EOS>
"Their
<EOS>
discourse
was
here
interrupted
by
Don
Fortunio
,
who
had
entered
the
hall
unnoticed
by
either
of
them
,
and
now
coughed
slightly
to
announce
his
presence
.
<EOS>
He
expressed
the
greatest
pleasure
at
beholding
Standish
,
and
inquired
anxiously
after
the
countess
,
and
how
the
siege
progressed
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
hope
she
still
defies
her
enemies
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"Resolutely
<EOS>
as
ever
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
not
relaxed
in
their
efforts
,
but
all
those
engaged
in
its
defence
believe
that
Lathom
House
will
never
be
taken
.
<EOS>
""I
joy
to
hear
you
say
so
,
"
cried
Don
Fortunio
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Earl
of
Derby
will
speedily
raise
the
siege
—
of
that
you
may
feel
certain
,
"
remarked
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
The
countess
has
endured
much
,
but
I
trust
the
worst
is
over
.
<EOS>
""Her
<EOS>
losses
,
I
am
told
,
have
been
slight
compared
with
those
of
the
enemy
?
"
observed
Don
Fortunio
.
<EOS>
"True
,
"
replied
Standish
.
"
<EOS>
But
we
have
just
had
one
loss
that
has
afflicted
the
whole
garrison
.
<EOS>
Gertrude
Rosworm
has
been
killed
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
do
I
hear
?
"
cried
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Gertrude
Rosworm
killed
!
<EOS>
But
I
wonder
not
.
<EOS>
She
ever
exposed
herself
to
danger
.
<EOS>
""Her
end
was
heroic
.
<EOS>
She
saved
the
countess
from
an
assassin
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"Truly
<EOS>
,
that
was
an
heroic
death
,

exclaimed
Don
Fortunio

CHAPTER
XXXIHow
the
Jewels
were
sold
to
Simon
Ophir
,
the
Liverpool
JewBREAKFAST
was
finished
,
but
the
little
party
were
still
seated
at
the
table
,
when
Randal
,
who
had
attended
upon
them
during
the
meal
,
suddenly
disappeared
,
but
returned
in
a
few
minutes
,
and
signified
to
Standish
that
he
had
something
to
say
to
him
in
private
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
young
man
arose
,
and
bowing
to
his
friends
,
followed
the
steward
out
of
the
hall
.
<EOS>
"Be
<EOS>
pleased
to
come
with
me
to
my
lord
's
cabinet
,
"
said
Randal
,
leading
the
way
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
"Wherefore
<EOS>
thither
?
"
demanded
Standish
,
struck
by
his
manner
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
expect
his
lordship
?
<EOS>
Is
he
<EOS>
here?"The
steward
,
however
,
made
no
reply
,
but
on
reaching
the
cabinet
,
opened
the
door
,
and
admitted
him
.
<EOS>
Two
persons
were
in
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
was
the
Earl
of
Derby
himself
.
<EOS>
He
had
evidently
ridden
far
,
and
had
just
dismounted
,
having
hastily
taken
off
his
mantle
,
and
thrown
his
feathered
hat
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
He
looked
somewhat
haggard
,
and
scarcely
greeted
Standish
as
he
entered
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
With
him
was
an
elderly
personage
,
who
from
his
aspect
might
have
been
taken
for
a
Puritan
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
sharp
and
intelligent
,
and
his
eyes
keen
.
<EOS>
He
was
enveloped
in
a
loose
gown
fastened
at
the
neck
,
that
concealed
the
rest
of
his
costume
,
and
had
not
removed
his
steeple
-
crowned
hat
.
<EOS>
Beside
him
on
the
table
were
two
large
leather
bags
,
which
Standish
felt
sure
contained
money
.
<EOS>
The
earl
did
not
mention
the
name
of
this
personage
,
and
treated
him
with
great
hauteur
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
you
brought
the
jewels
with
you
?
"
<EOS>
was
the
earl
's
first
inquiry
of
Standish
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
,
my
lord
,
"
he
replied
,
producing
the
cases
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
handed
them
to
the
stranger
,
whose
keen
eyes
glistened
as
he
carefully
inspected
their
contents
.
<EOS>
The
examination
took
some
time
,
during
which
not
a
word
was
spoken
,
but
the
earl
and
Standish
exchanged
significant
glances
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
had
seen
an
Israelite
money
lender
in
Liverpool
,
named
Simon
Ophir
,
who
had
grown
rich
by
the
necessities
of
Cavaliers
.
<EOS>
He
suspected
this
to
be
the
person
,
and
he
was
right
in
his
surmise
.
<EOS>
"Are
<EOS>
you
satisfied
?
"
said
the
earl
,
when
the
usurer
had
finished
his
inspection
.
<EOS>
"Yes
,
they
are
fine
jewels
,
no
doubt
,
"
replied
Ophir
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
I
give
three
thousand
pounds
for
them
,
I
shall
gain
very
little
by
the
transaction
.
<EOS>
""I
will
abate
nothing
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
,
haughtily
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
the
jewels
to
be
worth
double
the
sum
I
have
asked
.
<EOS>
You
know
full
well
that
if
I
did
not
want
the
money
for
an
especial
purpose
I
would
not
part
with
them
.
<EOS>
""Yes
<EOS>
,
I
am
aware
of
that
,
"
replied
Ophir
,
"
and
I
have
so
much
respect
for
your
lordship
that
I
would
strain
a
point
to
serve
you
.
<EOS>
Though
,
from
prudential
reasons
,
I
maintain
the
exterior
of
a
Puritan
,
I
am
a
Royalist
at
heart
,
and
my
sympathies
are
entirely
with
your
party
.
<EOS>
I
only
lend
money
to
Cavaliers
,
and
always
to
those
of
good
family
.
<EOS>
""Yes
<EOS>
,
I
am
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
has
had
a
thousand
pounds
from
you
,
"
observed
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
'
Twas
he
recommended
you
to
me
.
<EOS>
""Sir
<EOS>
Thomas
is
not
the
only
one
of
your
lordship
's
friends
I
have
served
,
"
remarked
Ophir
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Molineux
and
Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton
could
tell
you
something
if
they
chose
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
want
to
hear
it
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
They
would
have
had
no
dealings
with
you
,
if
they
could
have
helped
it
.
<EOS>
Neither
would
I.""Your
lordship
is
mistaken
in
me
,
"
rejoined
Ophir
.
<EOS>
"
I
desire
to
deal
honourably
and
fairly
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
to
Knowsley
at
your
request
,
and
have
brought
with
me
three
thousand
pounds
in
gold
,
wherewith
to
purchase
certain
diamonds
,
which
your
lordship
values
at
double
the
sum
,
but
which
I
feel
sure
will
leave
me
small
profit
—
if
not
entail
loss
.
<EOS>
However
,
a
bargain
is
a
bargain
,
and
I
am
content
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
the
exact
amount
in
those
bags
.
<EOS>
""Take
<EOS>
not
his
word
,
my
lord
,
"
interposed
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
the
money
be
counted
.
<EOS>
I
am
willing
to
undertake
the
task
.
<EOS>
""I
can
make
no
objection
,
"
said
the
moneylender
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
the
sum
be
not
correct
,
I
will
forfeit
double
the
amount
.
<EOS>
""Trust
<EOS>
him
not
<EOS>
,
I
repeat
,
my
lord
,
"
cried
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
Such
fellows
are
not
to
be
believed
on
oath
.
<EOS>
""Count
<EOS>
it
,
then
—
count
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ophir
angrily
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
will
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
And
untying
the
neck
of
one
of
the
bags
,
he
emptied
half
its
glittering
contents
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
"I
leave
the
matter
in
your
hands
,
Frank
,
"
said
the
earl
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
send
Randal
Fermor
to
help
you
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
quitted
the
cabinet
,
and
proceeded
to
the
great
hall
,
where
he
found
Don
Fortunio
and
Engracia
.
<EOS>
His
appearance
did
not
cause
them
surprise
,
as
they
had
been
prepared
for
his
arrival
by
Standish
,
but
they
were
greatly
pleased
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
Don
Fortunio
did
not
venture
to
make
any
inquiries
which
the
earl
might
have
been
indisposed
to
answer
,
but
he
obtained
the
satisfactory
assurance
that
Lathom
House
would
soon
be
delivered
from
its
assailants
.
<EOS>
After
some
little
time
spent
in
converse
,
they
walked
out
into
the
garden
,
as
the
earl
was
anxious
to
see
how
it
looked
,
but
they
had
not
got
beyond
the
terrace
,
when
they
were
joined
by
Standish
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
the
affair
settled
?
"
inquired
the
earl
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
and
added
in
a
low
tone
to
his
lordship:"The
money
was
perfectly
right
,
so
I
did
the
rascal
an
injustice
.
<EOS>
He
has
departed
with
his
treasures
,
and
I
frightened
him
by
saying
he
would
certainly
be
robbed
before
he
got
to
Liverpool
.
<EOS>
""You
did
wrong
,
Frank
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
Should
his
fears
be
realised
,
he
will
think
you
hired
the
robbers
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
for
that
matter
,
I
feel
half
inclined
to
turn
robber
myself
,
"
laughed
Standish
.
<EOS>
"You
will
be
otherwise
employed
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
accompany
me
to
Chester
.
<EOS>
I
shall
set
out
in
an
hour
.
<EOS>
""So
soon
,
my
lord
?
"
cried
the
young
man
,
gazing
wistfully
at
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"I
have
done
all
I
came
to
do
,
and
shall
return
without
delay
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
is
Randal
Fermor?""You
will
find
him
in
your
cabinet
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
I
left
him
in
charge
of
the
money
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
earl
then
re
-
entered
the
house
,
and
proceeded
to
his
cabinet
,
where
he
found
the
steward
,
who
showed
him
the
bags
of
money
,
and
received
his
orders
respecting
them
.
<EOS>
They
were
to
be
carried
by
two
of
the
troopers
who
had
come
with
his
lordship
from
Chester
.
<EOS>
The
hour
had
flown
with
inconceivable
quickness
as
it
seemed
to
Engracia
and
her
lover
,
allowing
scarce
time
enough
,
they
thought
,
for
a
tender
parting
.
<EOS>
But
the
earl
,
who
had
bidden
adieu
to
Don
Fortunio
,
was
in
the
saddle

<EOS>
His
little
troop
was
ready

<EOS>
Linacre

also

was
ready

PRINCE
RUPERTCHAPTER
IOf
the
Royalist
Force
under
Prince
RupertLORD
DERBY
and
his
attendants
having
made
their
way
safely
to
Cuerdley
,
crossed
the
Mersey
at
Penketh
Ferry
,
and
rode
on
to
Daresbury
,
where
the
earl
learnt
to
his
great
satisfaction
that
Prince
Rupert
had
entered
Cheshire
,
and
was
marching
with
an
army
of
ten
thousand
men
,
chiefly
cavalry
,
from
Betley
,
where
he
made
a
short
halt
,
towards
Has
-
lington
and
Sandbach
.
<EOS>
Report
added
that
the
inhabitants
of
Nantwich
,
most
of
whom
were
friendly
to
the
Parliament
,
had
been
thrown
into
the
greatest
consternation
,
as
they
expected
the
town
would
be
assaulted
by
the
prince
,
but
he
appeared
to
have
other
designs
.
<EOS>
The
Royalist
troops
,
however
,
were
plundering
the
whole
district
,
seizing
all
the
horses
they
could
find
,
and
forcing
great
numbers
of
the
peasantry
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
On
receiving
this
intelligence
,
Lord
Derby
at
once
altered
his
plan
,
and
instead
of
proceeding
to
Chester
,
struck
across
the
country
towards
Knutsford
,
resting
for
the
night
at
Nether
Peover
.
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
he
ascertained
that
the
prince
was
advancing
with
his
whole
force
to
Knutsford
,
and
rode
on
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
abundant
evidences
were
afforded
that
a
large
army
was
on
the
march
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
farmhouses
were
deserted
,
and
the
country
folk
were
flying
in
all
directions
,
fearful
of
being
compelled
to
serve
as
recruits
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
advanced
guard
of
the
Royal
army
came
in
sight
.
<EOS>
It
consisted
of
five
hundred
lancers
,
and
a
like
number
of
cuirassiers
,
all
well
mounted
and
completely
armed
—
the
foremost
being
furnished
with
steel
caps
,
gorgets
,
and
breast
-
plates
,
and
the
latter
with
polished
cuirasses
,
that
glittered
in
the
sun
.
<EOS>
Then
followed
several
regiments
of
harquebussiers
and
dragoons
.
<EOS>
These
did
not
make
quite
such
a
brilliant
show
as
the
troops
that
had
gone
before
them
,
but
were
quite
as
serviceable
in
the
field
—
if
not
more
so
.
<EOS>
The
artillery
consisted
of
twenty
large
cannons
,
each
drawn
by
four
strong
horses
.
<EOS>
These
pieces
of
ordnance
had
just
been
used
at
Newark
.
<EOS>
The
infantry
,
which
we
have
said
was
not
so
numerous
as
the
horse
,
comprised
six
regiments
,
each
five
hundred
strong
,
and
besides
there
were
a
thousand
pikemen
and
billmen
.
<EOS>
Viewed
from
the
brow
of
a
hill
,
as
Lord
Derby
first
beheld
it
,
with
its
flags
flying
,
and
its
numerous
richly
accoutred
officers
riding
with
their
men
,
this
large
army
presented
a
splendid
sight
,
well
calculated
to
fill
the
earl
with
martial
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
Equal
ardour
was
kindled
in
Standish
's
breast
,
and
he
longed
to
join
the
force
,
which
appeared
to
him
resistless
.
<EOS>
Having
gazed
at
the
spectacle
for
a
few
minutes
and
listened
to
the
stirring
strains
that
added
so
materially
to
its
effect
,
the
earl
rode
down
the
hill
,
and
galloped
past
the
lancers
and
cuirassiers
till
he
met
the
prince
,
with
whom
were
several
officers
of
distinction
.
<EOS>
Most
of
them
were
fine
-
looking
men
,
but
not
to
compare
with
their
valiant
leader
.
<EOS>
As
usual
Prince
Rupert
was
magnificently
accoutred
,
and
bestrode
a
powerful
charger
.
<EOS>
Elated
by
his
recent
successes
,
confident
in
his
ability
to
subdue
the
foe
on
any
future
engagement
,
and
burning
for
revenge
,
he
looked
full
of
spirit
,
though
even
when
thus
excited
,
his
countenance
had
a
stern
expression
,
and
when
he
spoke
his
eyes
seemed
occasionally
to
flash
fire
.
<EOS>
The
prince
was
much
surprised
to
behold
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
as
he
had
not
expected
to
meet
him
on
the
march
,
but
he
greeted
him
most
cordially
.
<EOS>
No
halt
was
made
.
<EOS>
The
officers
who
were
with
the
prince
when
Lord
Derby
came
up
fell
back
,
and
left
them
together
.
<EOS>
They
then
rode
side
by
side
,
and
were
soon
engaged
in
earnest
discourse
,
which
was
conducted
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
Rupert
's
expression
became
fiercer
,
and
his
eye
blazed
as
he
listened
to
what
the
earl
said
to
him
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
representations
made
to
him
,
it
seemed
that
the
prince
had
not
exactly
comprehended
the
condition
of
the
countess
at
Lathom
House
,
nor
was
he
aware
of
the
indignities
to
which
she
had
been
subjected
.
<EOS>
But
when
Lord
Derby
explained
what
had
really
occurred
during
the
siege
,
he
was
exceedingly
wroth
.
<EOS>
"I
had
no
idea
my
cousin
,
the
countess
,
had
been
so
much
distressed
by
these
insolent
rebels
,
"
he
said
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
promise
you
she
shall
be
speedily
delivered
from
them
.
<EOS>
I
will
do
nothing
till
I
have
succoured
her
,
and
avenged
her
on
her
malicious
enemies
.
<EOS>
""I
thank
your
highness
for
these
promises
which
I
am
sure
will
be
fulfilled
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
Had
my
noble
wife
been
able
to
contend
with
her
enemies
<EOS>
she
would
not
have
asked
for
assistance
.
<EOS>
But
she
fears
that
the
garrison
may
be
reduced
by
famine
.
<EOS>
""That
shall
never
be
,
"
cried
Prince
Rupert
.
<EOS>
"
In
a
few
days
I
shall
be
before
the
castle
,
and
we
shall
then
see
how
long
the
siege
will
endure
.
<EOS>
""Again
<EOS>
I
thank
your
highness
in
my
wife
's
name
and
my
own
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Had
I
not
lost
all
my
men
before
I
retired
to
the
Isle
of
Man
,
it
would
not
have
been
needful
for
me
to
apply
to
you
for
aid
.
<EOS>
But
your
soldiers
shall
be
well
rewarded
for
the
service
they
will
render
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
brought
three
thousand
pounds
in
gold
with
me
,
which
I
will
place
in
your
highness
's
hands
to
be
distributed
among
them
when
the
siege
is
raised
.
<EOS>
""By
my
faith
!
<EOS>
you
have
done
well
,
cousin
,
and
<EOS>
I
thank
you
heartily
,
"
cried
Rupert
.
<EOS>
"
My
men
want
pay
as
you
are
well
aware
,
and
this
will
gratify
them
.
<EOS>
""It
is
right
<EOS>
your
highness
should
know
that
the
money
is
the
produce
of
my
wife
's
jewels
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
cousin
,
the
countess
,
therefore
,
will
reward
the
men
.
<EOS>
""They
shall
know
that
,
"
said
the
prince
;
"
and
they
will
then
comprehend
what
sacrifices
are
made
for
the
king
.
<EOS>
His
majesty
himself
shall
know
it
.
<EOS>
""After
<EOS>
the
siege
is
raised
,
I
make
no
doubt
I
shall
be
able
to
bring
his
majesty
large
bodies
of
men
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
in
the
present
state
of
Lancashire
,
which
is
now
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
rebels
,
it
is
impossible
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
""All
that
shall
speedily
be
changed
,
"
said
Rupert
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
storm
Bolton
and
Wigan
.
<EOS>
""I
rejoice
to
hear
it
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
With
this
force
neither
place
will
be
able
to
withstand
your
assault
.
<EOS>
You
mean
to
enter
the
county
,
I
conclude
,
by
Stockport
Bridge?""Such
<EOS>
is
my
design
,
"
replied
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
pass
will
be
strongly
defended
,
"
observed
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"I
count
upon
that
,
"
rejoined
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
they
bring
all
the
force
they
can
muster
from
Manchester
and
elsewhere
,
they
will
not
prevent
my
entrance
.
<EOS>
Your
lordship
must
help
me
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
the
command
of
my
cuirassiers
.
<EOS>
""I
thank
your
highness
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
If
we
do
not
cut
our
way
through
all
opposition
,
it
shall
not
be
my
fault
.
<EOS>
"Knutsford
,
then
but
a
very
small
town
,
afforded
poor
quarters
for
so
large
a
force
.
<EOS>
Tents
were
therefore
pitched
in
Tatton
Park
,
while
Toft
Hall
,
Booth
's
Hall
,
Mere
Hall
,
and
several
other
habitations
in
the
neighbourhood
were
occupied
.
<EOS>
The
prince
and
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
with
some
of
the
chief
officers
,
found
lodgings
at
Tabley
Hall
,
the
residence
of
Sir
Peter
Leicester
.
<EOS>
Sir
Peter
,
who
had
suffered
much
for
his
loyalty
,
gave
them
a
hearty
welcome
,
but
his
house
had
been
recently
plundered
by
the
Parliamentary
soldiers
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
Tabley
Hall
,
Lord
Derby
's
first
business
was
to
deliver
to
the
prince
the
sum
of
money
he
had
promised
him
.
<EOS>
Rupert
smiled
as
the
bags
of
gold
were
placed
before
him
by
Standish
,
and
after
he
had
transferred
them
with
some
private
instructions
to
his
paymaster
,
he
said:"Lord
Derby
informs
me
,
Captain
Standish
,
that
you
are
about
to
return
to
Lathom
House
and
hope
to
gain
an
entrance
,
in
spite
of
the
besiegers
.
<EOS>
Should
you
succeed
in
doing
so
,
tell
the
countess
to
be
of
good
cheer
.
<EOS>
I
shall
shortly
come
to
her
succour
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
highness
may
be
sure
that
no
message
could
give
her
ladyship
greater
satisfaction
,
"
replied
Standish
,
"
and
I
hope
soon
to
deliver
it
.
<EOS>
If
fortune
favours
me
,
I
shall
see
her
ladyship
to
-
morrow
morn
.
<EOS>
""Good
,
"
rejoined
Rupert
,
approvingly
.
"
<EOS>
Are
you
alone?""I
have
one
attendant
with
me
,
your
highness
.
<EOS>
""You
can
depend
upon
him
?
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
brought
me
safely
through
the
trenches
,
your
highness
,
so
I
think
he
will
take
me
back
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
man
may
be
trusted
,
"
observed
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
He
conveyed
a
letter
to
the
countess
from
Chester
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
write
to
her
now
.
<EOS>
Your
highness
's
message
will
suffice
.
<EOS>
When
she
learns
that
relief
is
at
hand
,
she
will
be
perfectly
content
.

"CHAPTER
<EOS>
IIHow
Standish
returned
to
Lathom
House
,
but
stayed
to
sup
at
Knowsley
on
the
Way
thitherEVENING
was
coming
on
,
when
Standish
,
attended
by
Linacre
,
set
out
from
Tabley
Hall
.
<EOS>
On
his
way
to
Daresbury
,
whither
he
speeded
,
he
encountered
several
foraging
parties
,
but
as
they
belonged
to
Prince
Rupert
's
army
,
they
did
not
molest
him
.
<EOS>
From
Daresbury
he
galloped
on
to
the
ferry
that
had
served
his
turn
in
the
morning
,
crossed
the
Mersey
to
Penketh
,
and
went
on
at
the
same
rapid
pace
to
Prescot
.
<EOS>
His
intention
was
to
halt
at
Knowsley
,
and
he
hoped
to
reach
the
house
before
its
inmates
had
retired
to
rest
.
<EOS>
He
succeeded
in
his
design
,
and
astonished
Don
Fortunio
and
Engracia
by
his
unexpected
appearance
in
the
great
banqueting
-
hall
.
<EOS>
Engracia
uttered
a
cry
when
she
beheld
him
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
it
possible
<EOS>
you
can
have
returned
so
soon
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
gave
us
no
hopes
of
seeing
you
again
.
<EOS>
""I
had
no
expectation
of
returning
immediately
when
I
left
you
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
tidings
that
will
delight
you
.
<EOS>
Prince
Rupert
is
coming
with
a
large
force
to
the
countess
's
relief
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
him
,
and
am
on
the
way
to
Lathom
with
a
message
from
his
highness
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
hastily
recounted
all
that
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
They
listened
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
to
his
narration
,
and
so
did
Randal
Fermor
,
who
was
present
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
"You
must
be
fatigued
by
your
long
ride
,
sir
,
"
said
the
old
steward
,
filling
a
goblet
with
wine
,
and
presenting
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
"Touch
<EOS>
the
cup
with
your
lips
ere
<EOS>
I
drink
<EOS>
,
I
pray
you
,
fair
damsel
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
She
complied
,
exclaiming
at
the
same
time
:
"
To
the
countess
's
speedy
deliverance
.
"While
<EOS>
Standish
emptied
the
goblet
,
Don
Fortunio
likewise
drank
the
same
toast
,
and
as
it
was
now
quite
evident
that
the
young
man
stood
in
need
of
some
refreshment
,
the
steward
pressed
him
to
sit
down
at
the
table
,
at
the
same
time
placing
part
of
a
cold
fowl
before
him
.
<EOS>
To
bear
him
company
,
Don
Fortunio
,
who
had
finished
supper
,
began
again
,
and
even
Engracia
ate
a
little
more
.
<EOS>
But
while
thus
taking
care
of
himself
he
was
not
unmindful
of
his
attendant
,
but
sent
Randal
to
look
after
Linacre
and
the
horses
.
<EOS>
Having
rested
sufficiently
,
and
renovated
his
strength
by
a
good
supper
,
Standish
took
leave
of
his
friends
,
and
again
set
forth
on
his
perilous
journey
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
dark
,
but
he
rode
swiftly
through
the
park
with
his
attendant
,
crossed
the
moors
safely
,
and
entered
the
wood
beyond
which
lay
the
camp
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Here
he
halted
for
awhile
to
consult
with
his
attendant
.
<EOS>
The
greatest
caution
was
now
required
.
<EOS>
Linacre
thought
they
might
be
able
to
steal
through
the
camp
unperceived
,
but
if
the
alarm
should
be
given
,
they
must
trust
to
the
swiftness
of
their
horses
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
they
issued
from
the
wood
,
peering
through
the
gloom
,
and
listening
anxiously
for
any
sound
,
but
they
had
not
proceeded
far
when
they
were
challenged
by
a
sentinel
whom
they
had
not
been
able
to
distinguish
in
the
gloom
.
<EOS>
As
they
made
no
answer
the
man
fired
,
upon
which
they
dashed
on
,
determined
at
all
hazards
to
pass
through
the
camp
.
<EOS>
But
the
alarm
had
been
given
,
drums
were
beaten
,
and
several
more
shots
fired
.
<EOS>
Linacre
displayed
great
skill
in
avoiding
the
danger
.
<EOS>
At
his
earnest
request
he
was
allowed
to
take
the
lead
,
and
it
was
well
that
Standish
consented
to
his
guidance
,
as
by
the
various
turns
he
made
,
he
completely
perplexed
the
enemy
,
and
caused
them
to
fire
upon
one
another
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
Standish
and
his
attendant
cleared
the
camp
,
and
without
hurt
or
hindrance
to
themselves
or
their
steeds
;
but
other
sentinels
had
to
be
passed
.
<EOS>
They
freed
themselves
from
the
first
who
challenged
them
by
shooting
him
,
and
then
galloped
towards
the
trenches
.
<EOS>
They
were
next
pursued
by
a
mounted
guard
,
who
shouted
to
them
to
stop
,
and
fired
at
them
when
they
refused
,
and
the
pursuit
continued
till
they
reached
the
fortifications
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
firing
had
been
heard
by
the
musketeers
on
the
ramparts
,
and
suspecting
what
was
taking
place
,
Captain
Chisenhale
,
who
had
a
party
of
men
in
readiness
,
instantly
sallied
forth
from
the
postern
-
gate
,
and
fired
a
volley
at
the
nearest
battery
.
<EOS>
This
was
done
to
distract
the
enemy
's
attention
,
and
proved
completely
successful
,
while
it
served
to
direct
Standish
and
his
attendant
in
their
course
,
and
they
now
made
for
that
part
of
the
trenches
which
was
nearest
the
gateway
.
<EOS>
But
their
pursuers
were
not
far
behind
,
and
shouted
to
their
comrades
to
stop
them
,
but
the
cries
were
unheard
.
<EOS>
The
fugitives
got
through
the
trenches
,
killing
three
men
who
sought
to
check
them
,
and
though
pursued
to
the
last
,
crossed
the
drawbridge
in
safety
,
and
entered
the
gateway
.
"Has
<EOS>
the
countess
retired
to
rest
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Standish
,
as
he
rode
into
the
court
.
<EOS>
"Her
<EOS>
ladyship
is
in
the
chapel
,
"
replied
Captain
Ogle
,
to
whom
the
inquiry
was
addressed
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
ordered
a
special
service
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
""Come
with
me
<EOS>
thither
,
"
cried
Standish
,
leaping
from
his
steed
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
news
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
.
<EOS>
"When
<EOS>
they
reached
the
chapel
,
the
service
was
just
finished
,
and
the
soldiers
who
had
attended
it
were
coming
forth
.
<EOS>
Standish
ordered
them
to
wait
outside
,
and
entering
the
little
fane
,
met
the
countess
and
Arch
-
deacon
Rutter
.
<EOS>
She
was
greatly
surprised
,
but
had
not
time
to
question
him
,
ere
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
"I
bring
a
message
to
your
ladyship
from
Prince
Rupert
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
His
highness
is
coming
to
succour
you
.
<EOS>
You
may
expect
him
ere
many
days
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
,
then
,
has
heard
my
prayers
,
"
she
exclaimed
.

CHAPTER
IIIHow
Stockport
Bridge
was
defended
by
Colonels
Duckenfield
and
Mainwaring
,
and
how
it
was
taken
by
Prince
Rupert
and
the
Earl
of
DerbyTHE
tidings
brought
by
Standish
that
Prince
Rupert
and
the
Earl
of
Derby
were
marching
to
succour
the
countess
quickly
spread
through
the
garrison
,
and
caused
so
much
excitement
,
that
the
musketeers
were
with
difficulty
prevented
from
shouting
out
to
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
The
countess
,
however
,
gave
the
strictest
orders
that
no
manifestation
whatever
should
be
made
,
and
her
injunctions
were
enforced
by
Major
Farrington
and
the
officers
.
<EOS>
Standish
had
explained
to
her
ladyship
that
the
prince
and
the
earl
meant
to
enter
Lancashire
by
Stockport
Bridge
,
which
was
certain
to
be
defended
by
a
strong
force
of
the
enemy
,
and
that
till
this
pass
was
won
,
she
must
not
reckon
upon
the
immediate
appearance
of
her
deliverers
.
<EOS>
The
well
-
judging
lady
was
of
the
same
opinion
,
and
though
she
had
no
apprehension
of
the
result
of
the
conflict
which
she
felt
must
ensue
at
Stockport
,
she
would
not
allow
any
precautions
to
be
neglected
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
the
contrary
we
must
be
more
vigilant
than
ever
,
"
she
said
,
"
lest
the
enemy
should
make
a
last
attempt
to
assault
the
castle
before
they
are
forced
to
abandon
the
siege
.
<EOS>
""My
counsel
is
that
we
should
make
another
grand
sortie
,
"
said
Major
Farrington
,
"
and
if
we
can
,
drive
the
enemy
from
the
trenches
,
before
our
friends
arrive
,
so
that
the
honour
may
rest
—
as
it
should
do
—
with
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
""I
am
quite
satisfied
with
what
I
have
done
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
desire
to
expose
my
brave
soldiers
and
their
officers
to
heedless
risk
.
<EOS>
""I
beseech
your
ladyship
not
to
think
of
us
,
"
observed
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
We
all
long
to
punish
the
enemy
,
and
shall
be
grievously
disappointed
if
we
have
not
another
opportunity
of
doing
so
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
there
is
nothing
to
fear
.
<EOS>
In
the
numerous
sorties
we
have
made
our
losses
have
been
trifling
.
<EOS>
""That
is
true
,
"
replied
the
countess
.
"
<EOS>
Heaven
has
fought
with
us
.
<EOS>
My
brave
soldiers
shall
not
be
deprived
of
the
honour
they
covet
.
<EOS>
If
the
prince
and
my
lord
arrive
not
here
in
three
days
,
another
sortie
shall
be
made
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
should
it
not
be
made
to
-
night
,
madam
?
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
—
that
must
not
be
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Were
any
disaster
to
occur
,
my
lord
would
blame
me
.
<EOS>
"Standish
<EOS>
said
no
more
,
though
he
felt
mortified
by
her
ladyship
's
refusal
.
<EOS>
A
strong
sense
of
disappointment
pervaded
both
officers
and
men
that
they
were
not
to
be
allowed
a
last
chance
of
punishing
the
detested
foe
,
but
they
repressed
the
feeling
as
well
as
they
could
,
and
only
displayed
it
by
picking
off
a
man
now
and
then
on
the
batteries
.
<EOS>
A
strange
sort
of
quietude
prevailed
amongst
the
enemy
,
which
could
only
be
explained
by
the
supposition
that
they
were
preparing
either
for
a
general
assault
or
a
speedy
retreat
.
<EOS>
That
news
had
reached
them
of
the
advance
of
Prince
Rupert
and
the
earl
was
apparent
,
but
how
they
meant
to
act
under
the
circumstances
could
not
be
so
readily
conjectured
.
<EOS>
The
greatest
care
was
taken
by
Rigby
to
cut
off
all
communication
between
the
garrison
and
their
friends
,
and
he
succeeded
so
well
that
no
intelligence
,
later
than
that
brought
by
Standish
,
had
as
yet
reached
the
countess
.
<EOS>
She
knew
not
whether
Rupert
and
the
earl
had
passed
Stockport
Bridge
,
or
whether
they
had
been
compelled
by
the
successful
resistance
of
the
enemy
to
cross
the
Mersey
at
Warrington
.
<EOS>
In
the
latter
case
they
would
have
to
storm
the
town
,
and
this
would
occasion
considerable
delay
.
<EOS>
Linacre
and
another
scout
had
been
sent
out
to
obtain
information
,
but
neither
had
returned
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
though
the
garrison
knew
it
not
,
the
utmost
anxiety
prevailed
in
the
camp
of
the
enemy
,
and
constant
councils
were
held
by
Rigby
and
Colonel
Assheton
,
Colonel
Holland
having
returned
to
Manchester
on
the
first
tidings
of
the
prince
's
approach
,
as
it
was
not
improbable
that
town
might
be
assaulted
by
the
prince
.
<EOS>
All
the
available
force
that
could
be
got
together
by
the
Parliamentary
commanders
was
sent
to
Stock
-
port
to
defend
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
for
them
,
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
the
only
general
who
could
have
adequately
directed
their
efforts
at
this
critical
juncture
,
or
encountered
the
resistless
Rupert
with
a
chance
of
success
,
was
in
Yorkshire
,
and
could
not
arrive
in
time
.
<EOS>
The
Parliamentary
force
,
thus
hastily
collected
,
amounted
to
four
thousand
men
—
five
hundred
of
whom
were
contributed
by
Rigby
from
his
beleaguering
force
at
Lathom
.
<EOS>
The
commanders
of
this
force
,
which
consisted
chiefly
of
infantry
,
were
Colonels
Duckenfield
and
Mainwaring
,
two
officers
of
courage
and
experience
.
<EOS>
They
had
with
them
a
dozen
large
cannon
.
<EOS>
At
Stockport
,
the
Mersey
,
which
here
divides
Cheshire
and
Lancashire
,
runs
through
a
deep
ravine
with
high
cliffs
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
At
that
time
the
river
was
crossed
by
a
narrow
stone
bridge
,
which
from
its
position
could
be
easily
defended
.
<EOS>
Posted
on
the
Lancashire
side
of
the
river
,
the
Parliamentary
leaders
had
placed
six
of
their
cannon
so
as
to
command
the
bridge
,
and
the
rest
on
the
heights
above
.
<EOS>
The
cliffs
were
covered
with
musketeers
who
could
fire
upon
the
enemy
as
from
the
ramparts
of
a
castle
,
while
a
large
force
,
drawn
up
on
both
sides
of
the
bridge
,
was
ready
to
dispute
the
passage
.
<EOS>
When
Prince
Rupert
looked
down
upon
this
formidable
pass
,
and
saw
how
well
it
was
defended
,
he
remarked
to
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
who
was
with
him:"The
rebels
have
done
their
best
to
keep
us
out
of
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
It
will
take
some
time
and
cost
some
men
to
get
to
the
other
side
of
this
ravine
,
but
we
shall
do
it
in
spite
of
them
.
<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
your
highness
go
first
,
or
shall
I
clear
the
bridge
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"No
,
cousin
.
<EOS>
No
one
shall
go
before
me
,
"
replied
the
prince
.
"
<EOS>
Follow
with
the
cuirassiers
.
<EOS>
"Having
<EOS>
given
some
orders
,
the
valiant
prince
,
who
loved
to
confront
danger
,
drew
his
sword
,
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
his
lancers
,
and
dashed
down
the
precipitous
bank
like
a
torrent
,
sweeping
all
before
it
.
<EOS>
Utterly
unable
to
withstand
the
furious
onset
,
the
soldiers
,
who
guarded
the
approach
to
the
bridge
were
either
cut
to
pieces
,
or
driven
back
upon
their
comrades
,
so
that
the
bridge
was
crowded
with
<EOS>
soldiers
jammed
so
closely
together
that
they
could
not
move
hand
or
foot
.
<EOS>
In
this
helpless
condition
they
were
mercilessly
slaughtered
by
the
lancers
,
to
escape
whom
numbers
leaped
over
the
parapets
into
the
river
and
were
drowned
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
,
Rupert
was
across
the
bridge
,
cutting
down
,
or
scattering
the
new
force
that
vainly
attempted
to
oppose
him
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
the
musketeers
on
the
cliffs
had
begun
to
fire
,
and
showers
of
bullets
whistled
past
the
prince
,
but
he
seemed
to
bear
a
charmed
life
,
for
not
a
shot
struck
him
.
<EOS>
The
cannon
near
the
bridge
proved
useless
,
and
were
taken
before
the
engineers
could
open
fire
,
while
the
ordnance
on
the
heights
,
being
badly
levelled
,
did
more
harm
to
friends
than
foes
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
Earl
of
Derby
had
joined
the
prince
,
and
harquebussiers
and
dragoons
were
following
fast
,
so
that
the
whole
ravine
seemed
filled
with
soldiers
,
and
resounded
with
the
roar
of
cannon
and
the
rattle
of
musketry
.
<EOS>
To
prevent
the
Royalists
from
climbing
the
bank
,
Colonel
Duckenfield
had
barred
the
ascent
with
a
thousand
men
,
and
a
terrible
conflict
took
place
,
but
it
ended
in
the
complete
rout
of
the
Parliamentarians
,
more
than
half
of
whom
were
slain
.
<EOS>
The
battle
did
not
last
more
than
two
hours
,
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
Rupert
and
Lord
Derby
were
in
Lancashire
,
with
their
whole
force
—
neither
of
them
having
received
a
wound
,
while
the
enemy
were
flying
in
all
directions
.
<EOS>
The
losses
of
the
Royalists
were
slight
as
compared
with
those
of
the
foe
.
<EOS>
Quantities
of
arms
were
taken
,
and
many
prisoners
made
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
prince
's
entrance
into
Lancashire
had
been
marked
by
an
important
victory
,
tidings
of
which
would
quickly
spread
throughout
the
country
,
rousing
the
well
-
affected
,
and
filling
the
rebels
with
dismay
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
of
this
signal
defeat
,
Rigby
was
filled
with
consternation
.
<EOS>
Clearly
,
the
siege
of
Lathom
House
must
be
abandoned
,
since
he
could
not
doubt
that
Prince
Rupert
and
the
Earl
of
Derby
would
immediately
come
to
succour
the
countess
,
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
stand
against
them
.
<EOS>
He
knew
not
which
way
to
turn
.
<EOS>
If
he
retired
to
Manchester
,
he
should
inevitably
meet
the
foe
.
<EOS>
After
some
consideration
,
he
decided
upon
proceeding
to
Bolton
,
which
had
now
become
a
Puritan
town
,
and
where
there
was
a
strong
Parliamentary
garrison
.
<EOS>
But
he
determined
not
to
set
out
till
night
,
as
he
wished
to
keep
the
countess
in
suspense
to
the
last
moment
.
<EOS>
With
this
object
he
ordered
a
certain
number
of
men
to
remain
in
the
trenches
,
and
occupy
the
batteries
till
it
became
dark
.
<EOS>
Later
on
in
the
day
,
the
remnant
of
the
troops
he
had
sent
to
Stockport
returned
,
in
a
very
shattered
condition
,
several
of
them
wounded
,
and
most
of
them
without
arms
or
ammunition
.
<EOS>
Captain
Willoughby
and
Captain
Bootle
,
the
only
officers
left
,
out
of
half
a
dozen
,
gave
him
particulars
of
the
disastrous
fight
,
and
confirmed
his
apprehensions
that
the
victorious
Royalist
commanders
were
marching
to
Lathom
to
wreak
their
vengeance
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
alternative
,
therefore
,
but
flight
,
and
he
accordingly
hastened
his
preparations
for
departure
.
<EOS>
Before
setting
out
,
he
sent
Captain
Bootle
with
a
small
troop
of
horse
to
Knowsley
,
ordering
him
to
make
prisoners
of
Don
Fortunio
and
his
daughter
,
and
bring
them
to
Bolton
,
as
he
hoped
to
obtain
a
large
ransom
for
them
.
<EOS>
An
hour
before
midnight
,
he
had
assembled
his
whole
force
,
which
notwithstanding
the
losses
he
had
just
sustained
amounted
to
nearly
three
thousand
men
.
<EOS>
In
obedience
to
the
orders
given
them
,
the
soldiers
had
silently
quitted
the
trenches
and
batteries
,
and
nothing
indicated
that
the
musketeers
on
the
batteries
were
aware
of
their
departure
.
<EOS>
Screened
by
the
darkness
,
Rigby
then
stole
away
,
deeply
mortified
and
humiliated
,
the
Leaguer
that
had
lasted
nearly
four
months
being
thus
disgracefully
abandoned
.
<EOS>
All
possible
expedition
was
used
in
the
nocturnal
march
,
for
the
Parliamentarians
were
fearful
of
pursuit
,
knowing
that
quarter
would
not
be
given
them
,
if
they
were
overtaken
.
<EOS>
They
might
have
found
refuge
in
Wigan
,
which
was
not
far
off
,
but
Rigby
did
not
dare
to
stay
there
,
as
he
would
not
have
been
secure
from
the
vengeful
Earl
of
Derby
.
<EOS>
So
he
went
on
,
leaving
behind
him
at
Eccleston
and
Wrightington
such
of
his
wounded
soldiers
as
were
unable
to
continue
the
rapid
march
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
Lostock
Hall
,
he
halted
for
an
hour
,
and
then
made
his
way
over
the
hills
and
moors
lying
between
him
and
Bolton
,
arriving
there
soon
after
day-
break
.
<EOS>
Not
till
he
was
inside
the
mud
walls
that
protected
the
town
,
did
he
feel
secure
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IVOf
the
brief
Visit
paid
by
Prince
Rupert
to
the
CountessWHILE
Rigby
was
executing
this
rapid
retreat
,
the
officers
of
the
garrison
were
preparing
for
a
final
sortie
—
permission
having
at
last
been
accorded
,
though
reluctantly
,
by
the
countess
.
<EOS>
Just
before
dawn
,
Standish
,
accompanied
by
Lieutenant
Bretergh
and
fifty
musketeers
,
sallied
forth
from
the
great
gateway
;
and
at
the
same
time
Captains
Ogle
and
Rawsthorne
with
another
party
issued
from
the
postern
-
gate
.
<EOS>
Captain
Chisenhale
with
a
hundred
men
was
in
the
centre
court
,
and
Captain
Molineux
Radcliffe
was
on
the
ramparts
.
<EOS>
As
the
two
parties
cautiously
advanced
towards
the
trenches
,
they
were
surprised
to
find
that
all
remained
quiet
.
<EOS>
No
sentinels
could
be
discovered
,
nor
was
a
single
shot
fired
from
the
fortifications
.
<EOS>
Beginning
,
at
length
,
to
suspect
the
truth
,
Standish
dashed
on
,
plunged
unhesitatingly
into
the
trench
,
which
he
found
abandoned
,
and
next
scaled
the
nearest
battery
,
followed
closely
by
Bretergh
and
his
men
.
<EOS>
No
resistance
was
offered
.
<EOS>
Not
a
shot
was
fired
.
<EOS>
The
cannon
was
in
the
sconce
,
but
the
engineers
were
gone
.
<EOS>
Overjoyed
at
the
discovery
,
Standish
caused
his
men
to
shout
loudly
.
<EOS>
They
were
answered
from
the
fortifications
gained
by
Ogle
and
Rawsthorne
,
and
from
musketeers
on
the
ramparts
of
the
mansion
,
but
no
other
sound
was
heard
,
and
it
was
clear
that
the
besiegers
had
decamped
,
leaving
nothing
behind
them
except
such
ordnance
as
were
too
heavy
to
be
removed
.
<EOS>
Intelligence
of
this
important
discovery
was
immediately
sent
to
Major
Farrington
,
by
whom
it
was
conveyed
to
the
countess
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
prepared
for
the
good
news
by
the
shouts
she
had
heard
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
there
was
not
a
single
person
in
the
garrison
that
did
not
guess
the
truth
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
it
became
light
,
the
sudden
departure
of
the
enemy
was
confirmed
,
since
it
could
be
seen
that
the
tents
had
been
struck
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
Evidently
Rigby
had
taken
flight
,
alarmed
by
the
approach
of
Prince
Rupert
and
the
Earl
of
Derby
.
<EOS>
Standish
besought
permission
to
ride
forth
and
meet
the
earl
,
and
the
countess
yielded
to
his
solicitations
,
but
enjoined
him
to
take
a
guard
with
him
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
have
pleased
him
better
,
and
as
soon
as
the
horses
could
be
saddled
,
he
set
out
with
half
a
dozen
armed
attendants
.
<EOS>
Passing
through
the
deserted
trenches
,
and
making
his
way
past
the
fortifications
,
he
rode
on
to
the
site
of
the
camp
.
<EOS>
There
were
abundant
vestiges
of
the
besiegers
,
though
they
had
taken
with
them
all
they
could
.
<EOS>
Several
wounded
men
,
who
had
been
left
behind
,
were
lying
stretched
on
the
ground
,
groaning
with
pain
.
<EOS>
Some
of
these
poor
fellows
implored
his
help
,
and
from
them
he
ascertained
that
Colonel
Rigby
had
retired
with
his
whole
force
to
Bolton
.
<EOS>
They
also
informed
him
of
the
conflict
at
Stockport
,
adding
,
that
the
victorious
Royalists
were
marching
to
Lathom
,
and
could
not
be
very
far
off
.
<EOS>
This
proved
to
be
the
case
,
for
ere
he
had
quitted
the
spot
,
the
loud
blast
of
a
clarion
was
heard
,
and
a
regiment
of
lancers
emerged
from
the
wood
.
<EOS>
At
the
head
of
this
fine
body
of
men
rode
Prince
Rupert
and
the
Earl
of
Derby
.
<EOS>
Having
learnt
from
their
scouts
that
the
beleaguering
force
was
gone
,
they
had
ridden
on
with
the
advanced
guard
.
<EOS>
Instantly
recognising
the
two
noble
personages
,
Standish
rode
on
to
meet
them
.
"Soh
!
<EOS>
the
siege
is
raised
,
and
Rigby
gone
,
"
cried
the
prince
,
as
he
returned
Standish
's
salutation
.
<EOS>
"
Whither
has
he
fled?""To
Bolton
,
your
highness
,
as
I
learn
from
those
wounded
men
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"To
Bolton
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rupert
.
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
Lord
Derby
,
he
added
:
"
We
will
follow
him
thither
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
earl
signified
his
satisfaction
at
the
resolve
.
<EOS>
"Were
he
to
escape
punishment
,
all
the
rebels
in
the
county
would
deride
us
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Bolton
is
a
strong
place
,
as
I
have
found
,
but
it
shall
not
shelter
him
from
our
swords
.
<EOS>
""We
will
march
there
at
once
,
"
cried
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
come
to
Lathom
on
our
return
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
I
pray
your
highness
,
pass
not
by
the
castle
,
now
you
are
so
near
it
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
cheer
the
countess
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
"Thus
urged
,
Rupert
could
not
refuse
,
though
he
controlled
his
impatience
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
But
he
gave
orders
to
an
aide
-
de
-
camp
to
inform
the
different
officers
that
no
halt
should
be
made
,
but
that
the
whole
army
must
march
on
to
Bolton
,
adding
that
he
and
Lord
Derby
would
overtake
them
before
they
got
half
way
there
.
<EOS>
These
orders
given
,
the
prince
and
the
earl
,
attended
by
Standish
and
followed
by
a
guard
of
twenty
lancers
,
together
with
the
musketeers
from
the
garrison
,
rode
towards
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
batteries
,
they
stopped
for
a
few
minutes
to
examine
them
,
and
while
they
were
engaged
in
the
scrutiny
,
Standish
told
them
of
the
many
successful
sorties
made
by
the
garrison
,
and
how
the
great
mortar
had
been
captured
.
<EOS>
"Rigby
has
utterly
failed
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
has
battered
the
walls
,
knocked
down
a
turret
,
and
hit
the
Eagle
Tower
,
but
he
has
done
us
no
real
harm
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
many
soldiers
have
you
lost
?
"
demanded
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
half
a
dozen
,
your
highness
,
"
replied
Standish
.
"
<EOS>
But
upwards
of
five
hundred
of
the
enemy
have
been
slain
.
<EOS>
"Rupert
<EOS>
smiled
at
the
earl
,
but
made
no
remark
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
access
had
been
given
to
the
castle
through
a
breach
in
the
fortifications
,
and
a
portion
of
the
ditch
had
likewise
been
levelled
.
<EOS>
The
drawbridge
was
lowered
,
and
the
gates
thrown
wide
open
,
and
as
the
prince
and
the
earl
rode
into
the
court
-
yard
,
which
resounded
with
the
loud
and
joyous
shouts
of
the
musketeers
,
they
were
met
by
Major
Farrington
and
the
officers
of
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
But
Lord
Derby
did
not
linger
there
.
<EOS>
The
countess
and
her
daughters
had
just
come
forth
,
and
on
beholding
them
he
sprang
from
his
steed
,
and
hurrying
forward
clasped
them
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
Not
to
interrupt
this
joyous
meeting
,
the
prince
remained
for
a
few
minutes
in
converse
with
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
He
then
dismounted
,
and
tendered
his
homage
and
congratulations
to
the
countess
,
and
in
no
measured
terms
.
<EOS>
"I
am
no
flatterer
as
you
are
well
aware
,
cousin
,
"
he
said
,
"
but
a
rude
soldier
,
and
you
will
therefore
believe
me
when
I
say
that
I
do
not
think
there
is
another
woman
in
England
—
nay
,
for
that
matter
,
not
a
man
—
who
could
have
defended
this
castle
for
so
long
a
period
against
such
a
beleaguering
force
,
as
you
have
done
.
<EOS>
I
am
proud
of
you
,
cousin
—
very
proud
—
<EOS>
and
well
I
may
be
of
my
near
relationship
to
the
most
heroic
lady
of
her
day
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
praise
me
overmuch
,
cousin
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
countess
,
much
gratified
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
thank
you
nevertheless
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
you
are
proud
of
her
,
<EOS>
prince
,
what
must
I
be
,
who
can
call
her
wife
?
"
said
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Had
I
not
known
her
intrepidity
and
skill
I
should
not
have
left
her
here
.
<EOS>
But
she
has
more
than
justified
my
confidence
.
<EOS>
""Without
<EOS>
your
positive
orders
,
my
dear
lord
,
I
would
never
have
capitulated
,
and
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
I
told
the
messengers
sent
me
by
the
enemy
,
"
said
the
countess
.
"
<EOS>
And
had
not
you
,
prince
,
come
to
my
deliverance
,
I
would
have
perished
here
with
my
children
and
soldiers
.
<EOS>
Such
was
my
fixed
determination
.
<EOS>
I
thank
you
from
my
heart
for
what
you
have
done
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
I
have
done
nothing
,
"
rejoined
Rupert
.
<EOS>
"
It
has
not
been
needful
to
strike
a
blow
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
have
fled
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
terror
of
your
name
has
driven
them
hence
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
they
are
not
beyond
my
reach
,
"
said
the
prince
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
fled
,
but
I
shall
catch
them
.
<EOS>
I
have
sworn
to
avenge
your
wrongs
,
cousin
,
and
<EOS>
I
will
keep
my
word
.
<EOS>
I
will
exterminate
Rigby
and
his
host
.
<EOS>
""Rigby
does
not
deserve
mercy
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
a
traitor
and
a
robber
.
<EOS>
Whither
is
he
gone?""To
Bolton
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
There
we
shall
follow
him
,
so
we
must
now
bid
you
adieu
.
<EOS>
""This
is
indeed
a
brief
visit
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"But
we
shall
speedily
return
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"Will
not
your
highness
enter
the
house
,
and
drink
a
cup
of
wine
?
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"I
will
drink
no
wine
till
I
have
taken
Bolton
,
and
slain
Rigby
,
"
rejoined
Rupert
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ere
many
days
,
you
shall
see
us
again
,
if
all
goes
well
.
<EOS>
And
then
I
will
feast
with
you
,
and
rejoice
.
<EOS>
Farewell
,
dear
cousin!"While
the
prince
mounted
his
charger
,
and
rode
slowly
through
the
gateway
bowing
to
Major
Farrington
,
and
the
officers
,
Lord
Derby
lingered
for
a
moment
to
embrace
his
wife
and
daughters
,
and
shook
hands
heartily
with
Archdeacon
Rutter
and
the
other
chaplains
.
<EOS>
He
then
vaulted
into
the
saddle
,
and
followed
the
prince
amid
reiterated
shouts
from
the
musketeers
.
<EOS>
Gladly
would
they
have
accompanied
their
lord
to
Bolton
.
<EOS>
Gladly
would
the
officers
have
gone
with
him
.
<EOS>
But
the
earl
had
sufficient
force
,
and
would
not
reduce
the
strength
of
the
garrison
till
the
enemy
was
vanquished
.
<EOS>
All
therefore
were
left
behind
except
Standish
and
his
little
troop
,
who
had
the
enviable
privilege
of
attending
their
lord
.
<EOS>
As
the
earl
looked
back
at
the
castle
,
and
thought
of
all
that
had
happened
since
he
last
beheld
it
,
he
breathed
a
prayer
to
Heaven
for
its
marvellous
preservation
.
<EOS>
Just
as
Standish
had
passed
through
the
breach
in
the
fortifications
,
he
encountered
Linacre
,
and
stopped
for
a
moment
to
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
"What
news
from
Knowsley
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"Bad
news
,
"
replied
Linacre
.
"
<EOS>
Don
Fortunio
and
his
daughter
have
been
taken
prisoners
by
Captain
Bootle
,
and
carried
off
to
Bolton
.
<EOS>
They
were
taken
away
last
night
.
<EOS>
"Fain
would
Standish
have
questioned
him
further
,
but
time
was
not
allowed
him
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
the
two
leaders
set
off
at
a
rapid
pace
,
and
he
was
obliged
to
follow

<EOS>
THE
STORMING
OF
BOLTONCHAPTER
<EOS>
IHow
Bolton
was
assaulted
;
and
how
the
Attack
was
repulsedPRINCE
RUPERT
and
the
earl
overtook
the
army
before
it
had
proceeded
many
miles
.
<EOS>
A
brief
halt
was
made
at
Haigh
,
and
Standish
then
informed
Lord
Derby
,
with
whom
he
had
had
no
previous
opportunity
of
conferring
,
that
Don
Fortunio
and
his
daughter
had
been
carried
off
from
Knowsley
by
Captain
Bootle
.
<EOS>
This
intelligence
filled
the
earl
with
rage
,
and
he
exclaimed
that
if
he
caught
Bootle
,
he
should
be
put
to
death
as
a
felon
.
<EOS>
From
Haigh
they
marched
on
to
Heaton
,
where
they
again
halted
,
and
being
now
about
two
miles
from
Bolton
,
several
mounted
scouts
were
sent
across
the
moor
to
ascertain
how
the
town
could
be
most
advantageously
approached
.
<EOS>
Wishing
to
observe
the
movements
of
the
enemy
,
Standish
rode
out
at
the
same
time
as
the
scouts
,
and
mounted
a
little
eminence
,
whence
he
obtained
a
complete
view
of
the
town
,
here
about
half
a
mile
distant
.
<EOS>
The
defences
he
knew
had
been
planned
by
Rosworm
,
and
were
skilfully
made
.
<EOS>
Strong
mud
walls
,
having
a
deep
ditch
outside
,
surrounded
the
town
;
the
entrances
being
protected
by
barricades
with
stout
posts
and
chains
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
he
could
discover
after
a
careful
survey
,
there
were
only
two
gates
,
and
both
were
strongly
guarded
.
<EOS>
From
previous
experience
in
Manchester
,
he
knew
that
these
barricades
would
effectually
resist
cavalry
.
<EOS>
The
walls
therefore
must
be
first
gained
,
and
this
would
be
no
easy
task
,
for
they
were
thronged
with
musketeers
,
and
provided
with
several
large
pieces
of
ordnance
.
<EOS>
But
Standish
cared
not
for
difficulty
or
danger
,
and
thought
only
of
liberating
Engracia
from
her
captors
.
<EOS>
Floating
from
the
walls
were
a
great
number
of
flags
which
he
had
last
seen
on
the
batteries
menacing
Lathom
House
.
<EOS>
These
should
soon
be
torn
down
,
and
sent
to
the
countess
.
<EOS>
Before
quitting
his
post
of
observation
he
took
a
final
survey
of
the
town
,
and
was
obliged
to
confess
that
it
was
likely
to
make
an
obstinate
resistance
.
<EOS>
The
place
was
not
large
,
but
the
garrison
was
very
strong
,
and
unless
he
was
much
mistaken
,
Rosworm
was
there
in
person
.
<EOS>
Nothing
seemed
neglected
—
nor
could
he
detect
a
weak
point
in
the
defences
.
<EOS>
With
the
firm
conviction
that
the
assault
would
be
hazardous
,
though
burning
to
engage
in
it
,
he
rode
back
.
<EOS>
Two
of
the
scouts
had
already
preceded
him
,
and
declared
that
it
mattered
little
where
the
attack
was
made
,
as
the
whole
garrison
was
evidently
prepared
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
Standish
's
report
,
Prince
Rupert
would
not
wait
a
moment
longer
,
but
commanded
a
simultaneous
attack
to
be
made
on
the
walls
and
gates
.
<EOS>
The
trumpets
then
sounded
,
and
the
army
,
which
had
hitherto
looked
like
a
vast
compact
mass
,
divided
into
different
companies
,
some
moving
to
the
right
,
and
others
to
the
left
,
but
all
with
great
rapidity
.
<EOS>
Before
each
gate
was
a
squadron
of
horse
eager
to
dash
in
as
soon
as
an
entrance
could
be
forced
,
and
discharging
their
arquebuses
and
calivers
at
the
guard
,
who
,
screened
by
the
barricades
,
were
keeping
up
a
continuous
and
destructive
fire
against
them
.
<EOS>
Outside
the
entire
circuit
of
the
fortifications
,
which
was
not
of
very
great
extent
,
and
scarcely
exceeded
a
mile
and
a
half
,
were
collected
companies
of
infantry
,
who
were
endeavouring
to
cross
the
ditch
and
scale
the
walls
at
various
points
,
but
were
checked
in
their
efforts
by
the
obstinate
resistance
offered
by
the
defenders
.
<EOS>
In
every
instance
where
the
assailants
had
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
footing
they
were
killed
,
or
hurled
back
again
into
the
ditch
.
<EOS>
But
though
repulsed
,
they
constantly
returned
to
the
attack
,
and
desperate
fighting
,
attended
by
great
slaughter
,
went
on
ceaselessly
along
the
walls
.
<EOS>
Furious
at
the
unexpected
resistance
offered
by
the
Parliamentarians
,
of
whose
bravery
he
had
formed
a
very
contemptible
opinion
,
Prince
Rupert
galloped
round
the
walls
,
and
shouted
to
his
men
to
renew
the
assault
.
<EOS>
His
orders
were
reiterated
by
the
officers
,
but
despite
every
effort
,
no
substantial
advantage
was
gained
.
<EOS>
The
besieged
had
lost
very
few
of
their
number
,
while
the
Royalists
had
suffered
severely
,
and
stimulated
by
success
,
the
former
performed
prodigies
of
valour
.
<EOS>
Several
Cavaliers
of
distinction
were
killed
,
greatly
to
Rupert
's
vexation
,
and
the
loss
of
his
friends
,
slaughtered
before
his
eyes
on
the
walls
,
exasperated
him
to
the
highest
degree
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Derby
was
quite
as
much
incensed
as
the
prince
at
the
check
they
had
sustained
,
for
he
would
not
acknowledge
a
defeat
,
even
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
had
expected
an
easy
victory
,
and
a
repulse
by
Rigby
mortified
as
well
as
exasperated
him
.
<EOS>
Even
Standish
had
met
with
a
reverse
.
<EOS>
Though
he
had
received
no
orders
to
make
the
attempt
he
was
so
galled
by
what
he
witnessed
,
that
he
sprang
from
his
steed
,
and
calling
to
his
men
to
bring
a
scaling
ladder
,
gained
the
summit
of
the
walls
,
only
to
remain
there
for
a
minute
.
<EOS>
He
was
then
pushed
back
by
a
pikeman
,
luckily
without
receiving
a
wound
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
later
a
retreat
was
sounded
,
and
Rupert
and
the
earl
retired
,
slowly
and
in
good
order
,
evidently
intending
to
renew
the
attack
.
<EOS>
No
attempt
was
made
to
cut
off
their
retreat
,
for
the
Parliamentarians
were
too
prudent
to
quit
their
stronghold
.
<EOS>
Had
they
sallied
forth
,
the
Royalists
would
have
instantly
driven
them
back
,
and
entered
the
gates
with
them
.
<EOS>
When
they
were
beyond
the
reach
of
the
cannon
,
the
prince
and
the
earl
held
a
council
of
war
,
at
which
the
principal
officers
assisted
,
and
it
was
considered
how
an
entrance
could
be
found
for
cavalry
,
Rupert
,
whose
wrath
was
undiminished
,
declaring
he
was
resolved
to
take
the
town
,
and
give
quarter
to
none
within
it
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
IIHow
Stephen
Marsh
offered
to
take
Two
Hundred
Musketeers
into
the
TownAT
this
juncture
,
a
man
,
guarded
by
a
couple
of
musketeers
,
was
brought
in
by
an
officer
.
<EOS>
The
officer
explained
that
the
prisoner
stated
he
had
just
come
secretly
from
the
town
,
as
no
doubt
was
the
fact
,
and
,
moreover
,
asserted
that
he
could
render
the
prince
a
most
important
service
,
but
would
not
do
so
except
for
a
large
reward
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
art
thou
named
,
fellow
,
and
what
service
canst
thou
render
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Rupert
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
name
is
Stephen
Marsh
,
"
replied
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
dwell
in
Bolton
,
and
can
take
your
highness
into
the
town
—
but
I
must
be
well
rewarded
for
doing
so
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
say'st
thou
<EOS>
so
?
"
cried
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Make
good
thy
words
,
and
doubt
not
thy
reward
.
<EOS>
""I
must
have
it
now
,
"
replied
Marsh
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
not
my
word
suffice
?
"
observed
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"I
would
rather
have
the
money
,
"
rejoined
Marsh
,
bluntly
.
<EOS>
"Give
<EOS>
him
two
hundred
pounds
,
"
said
Rupert
,
to
one
of
his
officers
.
<EOS>
"
Will
that
content
thee?""Ay
,
marry
,
"
replied
Marsh
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
engage
to
bring
into
the
town
,
through
a
place
called
the
Private
Acres
,
as
many
musketeers
as
there
are
pieces
of
gold
in
this
bag
.
<EOS>
""Canst
<EOS>
thou
not
convey
horsemen
as
well
as
foot
?
"
demanded
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"Impossible
,
your
highness
,
"
replied
Marsh
.
<EOS>
"
Once
inside
,
the
musketeers
can
admit
their
comrades
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
near
the
Bradshaw
Gate,""Ay
,
if
that
gate
be
opened
for
us
,
the
crow
's
nest
will
be
soon
destroyed
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
think
you
of
this
,
my
lord
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
to
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
plan
can
not
fail
,
if
treachery
be
not
intended
,
"
rejoined
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
musketeers
will
have
me
with
them
,
"
said
Marsh
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
me
have
the
command
of
the
party
<EOS>
,
I
pray
your
highness
,
"
said
Standish
,
"
and
I
will
answer
for
the
rest
.
<EOS>
""Have
<EOS>
I
your
highness
's
permission
to
lead
the
van
in
this
new
assault
?
"
cried
the
earl
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
You
could
not
accord
me
a
greater
favour
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
be
it
so
,
"
replied
Rupert
.
<EOS>
"
Go
in
,
and
spare
not
.
<EOS>
No
quarter
must
be
given
.
<EOS>
""I
am
not
in
a
mood
for
pity
,
"
said
the
earl
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
quarter
given
!
"
cried
Marsh
.
<EOS>
"
I
repent
me
of
the
bargain
I
have
made
.
<EOS>
Take
back
the
money
.
<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
too
late
now
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thy
compact
must
be
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
Guide
me
forthwith
to
the
Private
Acres
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
turning
to
the
earl
,
he
added
:
"
Your
lordship
shall
not
have
to
wait
long
for
admittance
at
the
Bradshaw
Gate
.
"Putting
<EOS>
himself
at
the
head
of
a
company
of
musketeers
,
and
keeping
Marsh
beside
him
,
Standish
then
proceeded
cautiously
towards
the
town
.

CHAPTER
IIIWhat
passed
between
Colonel
Rigby
and
RoswormRIGBY
and
his
officers
were
greatly
elated
by
their
successful
defence
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
But
they
scarcely
liked
to
acknowledge
how
much
they
owed
to
the
skill
of
the
great
German
engineer
.
<EOS>
Rosworm
had
not
taken
an
active
part
of
the
defence
,
but
had
explained
his
plans
to
Rigby
,
by
whom
they
were
carried
out
,
with
the
result
just
described
.
<EOS>
But
though
Rupert
and
Lord
Derby
had
been
repulsed
,
Rosworm
felt
certain
the
assault
would
be
renewed
,
and
with
additional
vigour
,
and
he
warned
Rigby
not
to
be
too
confident
,
since
he
had
terrible
foes
to
deal
with
,
who
were
bent
upon
vengeance
,
and
would
not
depart
without
it
.
<EOS>
Rigby
paid
little
heed
to
the
counsel
,
for
he
now
felt
sure
he
could
hold
out
till
assistance
arrived
from
Wigan
,
Blackburn
,
Manchester
,
and
other
places
.
<EOS>
"Before
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
,
I
shall
be
reinforced
by
ten
thousand
men
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"But
before
to
-
morrow
,
the
town
may
be
taken
,
"
rejoined
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"I
am
not
uneasy
,
"
said
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
the
reception
given
them
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
the
prince
and
Lord
Derby
will
venture
to
make
another
assault
.
<EOS>
But
should
they
do
so
,
we
shall
repulse
them
again
.
<EOS>
""Keep
out
the
cavalry
<EOS>
and
you
are
safe
,
"
said
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
But
should
they
once
enter
,
the
town
is
lost
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
fortified
the
place
so
well
that
it
is
impregnable
,
"
said
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"There
is
but
one
weak
spot
,
and
that
the
enemy
will
never
discover
,
"
said
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
where
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Rigby
,
somewhat
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
found
it
out
myself
.
<EOS>
I
thought
the
walls
were
perfect
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
round
them
several
times
,
and
could
detect
nothing
wrong
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
walls
are
quite
secure
,
but
there
is
a
subterranean
passage
under
the
ditch
that
may
be
used
as
a
sally
-
port
,
"
replied
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
It
leads
to
a
place
called
the
Private
Acres
.
<EOS>
""Where
is
the
entrance
to
this
subterranean
passage
?
"
asked
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
the
cellar
of
a
house
belonging
to
one
Stephen
Marsh
,
"
replied
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
The
man
is
well
affected
towards
the
Parliament
.
<EOS>
""May
be
so
,
"
said
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
But
the
habitation
ought
to
be
guarded
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
orders
to
that
effect
,
but
I
must
first
go
to
the
church
,
where
two
worthy
ministers
,
Master
John
Harper
,
Pastor
of
Bolton
,
and
Master
John
Fogg
,
Pastor
of
Liverpool
,
are
offering
up
prayers
.
<EOS>
""I
will
cause
a
guard
to
be
placed
there
myself
,
since
you
deem
it
needful
,
"
said
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
desire
to
say
a
word
to
you
respecting
the
prisoners
who
have
been
brought
here
from
Knowsley
by
Captain
Bootle
.
<EOS>
Do
you
intend
to
detain
them?""Ay
,
till
they
are
ransomed
,
"
replied
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
can
not
bestow
a
thought
upon
them
now
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
you
know
where
they
are?""Not
exactly
,
"
replied
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
I
directed
Bootle
to
provide
them
with
a
lodging
,
and
he
told
me
he
had
done
so
.
<EOS>
As
I
have
just
said
,
I
have
not
had
time
to
think
of
them
.
<EOS>
""They
are
lodged
in
the
very
house
we
have
just
been
speaking
of
—
Stephen
Marsh's,"—said
Rosworm
.
"
<EOS>
The
young
damsel
was
greatly
terrified
by
the
assault
,
and
offered
me
some
jewels
if
I
would
deliver
her
and
her
father
,
and
their
Spanish
servant
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
comply
without
consulting
you
.
<EOS>
Will
you
take
these
jewels
as
a
ransom
,
and
let
them
go
?
<EOS>
They
can
depart
by
this
subterranean
passage
.
<EOS>
""Are
<EOS>
they
aware
of
the
outlet
?
"
asked
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
;
neither
is
Captain
Bootle
,
"
replied
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"I
will
give
the
matter
consideration
,
"
said
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
prisoners
are
best
here
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
we
may
have
another
assault
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
so
,
they
shall
be
removed
to
a
safer
place
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
been
to
church
—
if
nothing
happens
to
prevent
me
—
I
will
go
to
Marsh
's
house
.
<EOS>
""You
will
find
me
there
,
"
replied
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
They
then
separated
.
<EOS>
Their
discourse
had
taken
place
in
the
inner
room
of
a
large
inn
situated
in
the
market
-
place
,
the
other
rooms
of
the
house
being
filled
with
soldiers
,
who
were
refreshing
themselves
after
their
active
service
on
the
walls
.
<EOS>
In
the
market
-
place
itself
,
some
five
or
six
hundred
pikemen
and
clubmen
were
collected
,
numbers
of
whom
were
listening
to
a
preacher
in
a
grey
cloak
,
stationed
at
the
foot
of
the
old
stone
cross
,
who
was
congratulating
them
on
the
glorious
victory
they
had
achieved
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
how
soon
was
the
scene
changed
.
<EOS>
That
place
now
filled
with
stalwart
men
was
speedily
to
be
choked
up
with
the
dead
and
dying
.
<EOS>
The
tone
of
the
preacher
at
the
cross
in
the
market
-
place
was
full
of
exultation
.
<EOS>
"They
compassed
us
about
,
"
he
said
,
"
but
they
have
not
prevailed
against
us
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
of
Hosts
was
with
us
,
and
fought
for
us
,
and
if
they
return
,
he
will
help
us
to
smite
them
again
.
<EOS>
"Little
<EOS>
did
he
dream
that
in
the
next
assault
,
he
himself
would
be
smitten
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IVHow
Engracia
and
her
Father
escaped
by
the
subterranean
PassageIN
the
upper
room
of
a
house
,
scarcely
more
than
fifty
yards
from
the
mud
walls
surrounding
the
town
,
was
a
beautiful
young
damsel
,
whose
attire
and
features
showed
she
belonged
to
a
different
clime
.
<EOS>
She
was
kneeling
in
prayer
,
with
a
small
crucifix
clasped
in
her
hands
,
on
which
her
eyes
were
fixed
.
<EOS>
Close
beside
her
was
another
kneeling
figure
—
a
woman
somewhat
older
than
herself
,
and
of
inferior
degree
,
but
not
without
pretensions
to
good
looks
.
<EOS>
Both
were
very
earnest
in
their
supplications
to
the
Blessed
Virgin
to
deliver
them
from
the
hands
into
which
they
had
fallen
,
and
when
they
arose
,
they
believed
that
their
prayers
would
be
heard
.
<EOS>
The
dreadful
sounds
that
had
recently
assailed
their
ears
,
and
filled
them
with
terror
,
had
ceased
.
<EOS>
No
more
roaring
of
cannon
—
no
more
rattling
of
musketry
—
no
more
shouting
.
<EOS>
The
attack
was
over
,
and
seemed
to
have
ended
in
the
defeat
of
their
friends
,
for
as
such
they
regarded
the
assailants
.
<EOS>
But
though
greatly
distressed
by
this
result
,
they
did
not
believe
that
Heaven
would
abandon
them
;
nor
did
they
think
the
fight
was
entirely
ended
.
<EOS>
The
room
in
which
we
find
Engracia
and
her
attendant
Maria
,
looked
towards
the
town
,
and
on
approaching
the
windows
,
they
beheld
a
great
number
of
musketeers
and
pikemen
hurrying
past
.
<EOS>
These
men
were
making
towards
a
wide
street
that
seemed
to
lead
towards
the
centre
of
the
town
,
and
in
reality
conducted
to
the
market
-
place
,
whither
the
soldiers
were
proceeding
.
<EOS>
In
this
street
were
a
multitude
of
townsfolk
—
men
and
women
—
who
welcomed
the
soldiers
with
enthusiasm
,
and
proffered
them
jugs
of
ale
,
which
were
quickly
emptied
.
<EOS>
Part
of
the
mud
walls
,
and
a
barricade
,
that
served
to
defend
the
Bradshaw
Gate
,
could
be
seen
from
the
window
on
the
left
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
were
more
fortifications
.
<EOS>
As
seen
from
this
window
,
the
town
looked
like
a
mass
of
black
and
white
houses
,
in
the
midst
of
which
rose
the
tower
of
the
church
,
surmounted
by
a
broad
banner
.
<EOS>
Very
few
soldiers
could
be
perceived
on
the
walls
,
and
none
at
the
barricades
.
<EOS>
All
had
gone
to
the
taverns
,
or
to
the
houses
of
friends
,
to
refresh
themselves
.
<EOS>
Engracia
and
her
attendant
were
still
gazing
at
this
strange
scene
,
with
mingled
emotions
of
fear
and
curiosity
,
when
the
door
opened
and
Don
Fortunio
entered
the
room
accompanied
by
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
As
the
latter
had
shown
them
great
kindness
during
their
brief
captivity
,
Engracia
manifested
much
pleasure
on
beholding
him
.
<EOS>
"Colonel
<EOS>
Rosworm
has
been
endeavouring
to
obtain
our
release
,
but
without
success
,
"
said
Don
Fortunio
to
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Colonel
Rigby
will
not
give
him
a
decided
answer
.
<EOS>
""He
is
unwilling
to
part
with
you
,
"
said
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
I
offered
him
the
jewels
,
but
he
would
not
be
tempted
.
<EOS>
""Is
there
<EOS>
no
hope
of
deliverance
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
"
<EOS>
Are
Prince
Rupert
and
Lord
Derby
gone?""No
<EOS>
;
they
have
only
retired
for
awhile
,
"
replied
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
The
assault
will
be
renewed
.
<EOS>
""Holy
<EOS>
Mother
be
praised
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
still
hope
of
deliverance
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
much
,
"
rejoined
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
town
is
well
fortified
,
and
the
garrison
strong
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
assistance
will
arrive
ere
long
from
several
neighbouring
towns
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
you
see
there
is
but
<EOS>
little
hope
for
us
,
my
child
<EOS>
,
"
said
her
father
,
tristfully
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
"
ejaculated
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"Ay
de
mi
!
"
cried
Maria
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
not
despair
,
"
said
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Colonel
Rigby
himself
will
be
here
presently
.
<EOS>
Your
entreaties
may
have
more
effect
upon
him
than
my
proposition
.
<EOS>
"Scarcely
<EOS>
were
the
words
uttered
than
the
person
referred
to
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
As
usual
,
his
manner
was
rude
and
overbearing
.
<EOS>
Haughtily
saluting
Don
Fortunio
,
he
said:"I
have
come
to
tell
you
that
I
can
not
liberate
you
at
present
on
any
terms
.
<EOS>
But
you
shall
have
a
lodging
in
the
centre
of
the
town
,
where
you
will
be
safe
from
injury
,
in
the
event
of
a
second
assault
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
"Rosworm
<EOS>
glanced
at
the
Spaniard
,
who
understood
the
meaning
of
the
look
,
and
declined
the
offer
.
<EOS>
"I
would
rather
remain
where
I
am
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
I
require
this
house
for
other
purposes
,
"
rejoined
Rigby
.
"
<EOS>
So
I
beg
you
will
prepare
for
immediate
departure
.
<EOS>
"Feeling
<EOS>
remonstrance
would
be
useless
,
Don
Fortunio
did
not
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
"I
have
something
to
say
to
you
in
private
,
colonel
,
"
said
Rigby
,
signing
to
Rosworm
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
But
before
the
latter
could
obey
,
Captain
Bootle
burst
abruptly
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
His
looks
betrayed
great
anxiety
.
<EOS>
"Your
presence
is
needed
elsewhere
,
colonel
,
"
he
said
to
Rigby
.
"
<EOS>
Another
assault
may
be
speedily
expected
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
are
moving
towards
the
town
.
<EOS>
""I
will
come
with
you
instantly
,
"
replied
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
I
leave
the
prisoners
in
your
charge
,
Colonel
Rosworm
;
keep
them
here
,
or
take
them
where
you
list
.
<EOS>
When
you
have
seen
to
the
security
of
the
house
,
"
he
added
,
significantly
,
"
join
me
on
the
walls
.
<EOS>
"Without
<EOS>
waiting
for
a
reply
,
he
quitted
the
room
with
Captain
Bootle
.
<EOS>
Wishing
to
ascertain
the
truth
of
the
intelligence
<EOS>
just
brought
,
Rosworm
flew
to
a
room
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
,
which
commanded
the
country
on
the
further
side
of
the
fortifications
,
and
perceived
that
Rupert
's
whole
force
was
advancing
to
renew
the
attack
.
<EOS>
Having
thus
satisfied
himself
,
he
returned
to
Don
Fortunio
and
told
him
what
he
had
seen
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
you
remain
here
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
or
shall
I
take
you
to
another
lodging
.
<EOS>
You
must
decide
at
once
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
will
you
do
,
my
child
?
"
said
Don
Fortunio
to
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"Remain
<EOS>
here
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
Just
then
a
strange
noise
was
heard
below
,
and
Rosworm
went
forth
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
it
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
staircase
,
he
saw
that
the
lower
part
of
the
house
was
entirely
filled
with
armed
men
,
and
instantly
comprehended
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
A
party
of
Royalist
musketeers
had
gained
admittance
by
the
subterranean
passage
.
<EOS>
The
alarm
must
instantly
be
given
,
but
how
?
<EOS>
As
he
rushed
back
with
the
intention
of
flinging
open
a
window
,
he
was
followed
by
an
officer
who
had
discovered
him
.
"Advance
<EOS>
at
your
peril
!
"
cried
Rosworm
,
presenting
a
pistol
at
the
head
of
this
person
,
as
he
was
about
to
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
fire
,
for
at
that
very
moment
,
he
perceived
that
the
officer
was
no
other
than
Captain
Standish
,
and
lowered
the
weapon
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
exclamations
from
Don
Fortunio
and
Engracia
announced
that
they
had
recognised
the
new
-
comer
.
<EOS>
"Little
<EOS>
did
I
expect
to
find
you
here
,
Colonel
Rosworm
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
since
chance
has
brought
us
together
,
I
am
compelled
to
make
you
my
prisoner
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
disarm
you
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
need
not
do
so
,
for
I
shall
not
resist
,
"
said
Rosworm
,
replacing
the
pistol
in
his
belt
.
<EOS>
"
But
tell
me
,
how
did
you
discover
the
subterranean
passage?""It
was
shown
to
me
by
Stephen
Marsh
,
the
owner
of
this
house
,
who
brought
me
here
,
"
replied
Standish
.
"Ah
!
<EOS>
the
traitor
!
"
exclaimed
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"Traitor
<EOS>
to
Rigby
,
but
friend
to
Prince
Rupert
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
From
him
I
learnt
,
"
he
added
to
Don
Fortunio
,
"
that
a
Spanish
gentleman
and
his
daughter
,
who
had
been
seized
by
Captain
Bootle
,
were
lodged
here
.
<EOS>
Thus
I
was
prepared
to
find
you
here
,
and
what
is
more
to
liberate
you
.
<EOS>
"Up
<EOS>
to
this
moment
Engracia
had
been
kept
motionless
by
surprise
,
but
she
now
sprang
forward
,
and
was
clasped
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
you
take
us
away
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
.
"Impossible
!
"
<EOS>
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
remain
here
.
<EOS>
I
have
much
to
do
.
<EOS>
""We
will
stay
till
you
can
go
with
us
,
"
she
cried
,
still
clinging
to
him
.
<EOS>
"Nay
,
this
must
not
be
,
"
he
said
,
extricating
himself
from
her
embrace
.
"
<EOS>
Not
a
moment
must
be
lost
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
all
of
you
!
<EOS>
The
man
who
brought
me
here
will
take
you
safely
from
the
town
.
<EOS>
Come
quickly!""I
will
go
with
them
,
"
said
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"Come
,
then
,
"
cried
Standish
.
<EOS>
Taking
Engracia
's
hand
,
he
led
her
from
the
room
,
and
hastily
descended
the
staircase
followed
by
the
others
.
<EOS>
The
lower
part
of
the
house
,
as
already
intimated
,
was
filled
with
musketeers
,
but
they
drew
aside
to
allow
Standish
and
his
companions
to
pass
through
their
midst
.
<EOS>
A
short
flight
of
stone
steps
brought
them
to
a
vault
,
where
they
found
Stephen
Marsh
with
a
lighted
lantern
.
<EOS>
Standish
then
left
them
,
having
previously
confided
them
to
Rosworm
's
care
.
<EOS>
"Take
them
to
Lathom
House
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
fear
not
to
go
there
.
<EOS>
The
countess
will
receive
you
well
.
<EOS>
"CHAPTER
<EOS>
VThe
Second
Assault
,
and
the
MassacreAs
soon
as
the
firing
from
the
walls
announced
that
Lord
Derby
had
come
up
,
Standish
sallied
forth
from
the
house
at
the
head
of
his
party
of
musketeers
,
and
rushed
towards
the
barricade
.
<EOS>
So
completely
were
the
enemy
taken
by
surprise
by
this
sudden
attack
,
that
they
could
offer
little
resistance
,
and
almost
every
man
was
killed
.
<EOS>
From
the
barricade
,
the
victorious
party
hurried
on
to
the
gate
which
we
have
said
was
defended
by
stout
posts
and
chains
.
<EOS>
In
vain
the
guard
stationed
here
strove
to
oppose
the
furious
onset
.
<EOS>
Though
aided
by
their
comrades
on
the
walls
,
as
far
as
was
practicable
,
they
gave
way
after
a
short
but
sanguinary
conflict
,
and
Standish
was
master
of
the
gate
.
<EOS>
A
loud
shout
from
his
men
announced
their
success
,
and
they
proceeded
to
unfasten
the
chains
,
and
throw
open
the
gate
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
these
obstacles
were
removed
,
the
Earl
of
Derby
dashed
in
with
his
cuirassiers
,
shouting
with
a
loud
voice
,
"
No
quarter!"These
terrible
orders
were
strictly
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Exasperated
by
the
slaughter
of
their
comrades
in
the
previous
assault
,
the
men
swore
not
to
sheathe
their
swords
till
they
had
slaked
their
thirst
for
vengeance
.
<EOS>
Headed
by
the
earl
the
first
troop
galloped
along
the
main
street
towards
the
market
-
place
,
cutting
down
all
they
encountered
.
<EOS>
Shrieks
and
groans
were
heard
on
all
sides
,
but
no
pity
was
shown
.
<EOS>
Other
troops
rode
to
the
right
and
the
left
,
or
plunged
into
the
narrow
thoroughfares
shouting
out
,
"
Kill
!
<EOS>
kill
—
spare
not
—
spare
not
.
<EOS>
"Frightful
<EOS>
scenes
occurred
.
<EOS>
Blinded
by
fury
,
the
men
slaughtered
their
unresisting
victims
like
sheep
,
utterly
disregarding
their
cries
for
compassion
,
and
trampling
the
still
breathing
bodies
under
their
horses
'
feet
.
<EOS>
In
the
back
streets
,
the
wretched
inhabitants
were
quite
undefended
,
and
sought
to
escape
from
the
merciless
soldiers
,
leaving
their
wives
and
children
to
their
fate
.
<EOS>
In
the
market
-
place
,
however
,
the
Earl
of
Derby
found
a
great
number
of
pikemen
,
together
with
a
troop
of
horse
.
<EOS>
With
savage
satisfaction
,
he
perceived
that
the
latter
were
commanded
by
Captain
Bootle
,
and
burning
for
vengeance
,
he
instantly
charged
them
.
<EOS>
The
fierce
onset
could
not
be
resisted
,
and
such
of
the
Parliamentarians
as
were
not
cut
down
took
to
flight
,
their
retreat
being
aided
by
the
pikemen
.
<EOS>
But
their
leader
was
captured
and
disarmed
,
and
at
once
brought
before
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
Bootle
could
not
mistake
the
look
fixed
upon
him
by
the
earl
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
sued
for
quarter
.
<EOS>
"Spare
<EOS>
me
,
my
lord
,
"
he
cried
,
"
and
I
will
deliver
Rigby
into
your
hands
.
<EOS>
""Thou
<EOS>
art
false
to
the
last
,
perfidious
villain
!
"
cried
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
Already
thou
hast
betrayed
me
,
and
now
thou
wouldst
betray
him
thou
art
bound
to
serve
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
spare
thee
.
<EOS>
"Stabbed
<EOS>
to
the
heart
,
the
traitor
fell
from
his
horse
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
Prince
Rupert
had
entered
the
devoted
town
with
the
whole
of
his
army
,
and
the
work
of
destruction
was
then
carried
on
with
greater
fury
than
before
.
<EOS>
No
such
massacre
took
place
during
the
civil
wars
in
Lancashire
as
occurred
at
Bolton
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
The
soldiers
were
killed
on
the
walls
,
and
their
bodies
thrown
into
the
ditch
,
but
that
was
no
more
than
would
have
been
done
at
any
siege
.
<EOS>
All
the
pikemen
were
killed
;
but
they
could
not
expect
a
lighter
fate
.
<EOS>
The
houses
were
plundered
,
but
houses
had
been
plundered
in
every
town
taken
before
—
both
by
Roundheads
and
Cavaliers
—
at
Lancaster
,
at
Preston
,
at
Wigan
and
Warrington
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
indiscriminate
slaughter
of
the
in
-
habitants
,
after
the
garrison
had
surrendered
,
and
when
the
town
was
at
the
entire
mercy
of
the
victors
,
that
stamped
the
assault
with
the
character
of
a
massacre
.
<EOS>
The
ruthless
soldiers
spared
none
—
old
men
,
women
,
children
.
<EOS>
Four
divines
were
killed
—
one
a
venerable
man
with
grey
locks
,
who
had
stationed
himself
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
in
the
market
-
place
,
and
lifted
up
his
voice
to
denounce
them
,
had
his
skull
cloven
by
a
dragoon
.
<EOS>
The
streets
resounded
with
the
shrieks
and
groans
of
the
wounded
and
dying
,
and
the
kennels
ran
with
blood
.
<EOS>
Neither
Rupert
nor
the
earl
interposed
to
check
the
slaughter
.
<EOS>
In
the
market-
place
,
as
we
have
said
,
the
carnage
was
frightful
;
and
it
was
here
that
all
the
divines
we
have
mentioned
were
killed
.
<EOS>
One
of
these
addressed
the
earl
in
words
that
proved
prophetic
.
<EOS>
"Thou
hast
destroyed
Bolton
,
"
he
said
,
with
his
dying
breath
;
"
but
thou
shalt
not
escape
.
<EOS>
When
brought
here
to
die
—
as
thou
shalt
be
—
thou
wilt
remember
this
day
.
<EOS>
"Standish
<EOS>
took
as
little
part
as
he
could
help
in
these
dreadful
scenes
.
<EOS>
His
soul
revolted
from
them
,
and
he
would
have
shut
his
eyes
if
he
could
to
the
terrible
sights
forced
upon
him
.
<EOS>
On
Rupert
's
entrance
into
the
town
he
obtained
a
horse
,
and
feeling
sure
Rigby
would
seek
safety
in
flight
,
his
great
desire
was
to
prevent
him
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
well
nigh
succeeded
.
<EOS>
Discovering
that
Rigby
had
contrived
to
get
out
of
the
town
with
a
small
party
of
horse
,
and
was
making
all
haste
he
could
towards
Bury
,
Standish
put
himself
at
the
head
of
a
score
of
dragoons
,
and
galloped
after
him
.
<EOS>
He
continued
the
pursuit
for
a
couple
of
miles
,
and
might
have
overtaken
the
fugitive
,
if
a
body
of
Parliamentarians
had
not
been
seen
advancing
in
the
opposite
direction
.
<EOS>
These
men
were
no
doubt
hastening
to
the
relief
of
Bolton
,
but
were
too
late
.
<EOS>
They
came
,
however
,
in
time
to
rescue
Rigby
,
and
escorted
him
to
Bury
,
while
Standish
was
compelled
to
return
without
his
expected
prize
to
Bolton
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
VIHow
Standish
met
Rosworm
for
the
last
TimeWHEN
Standish
approached
the
town
,
he
found
Prince
Rupert
and
the
Earl
of
Derby
with
a
squadron
of
lancers
near
the
Bradshaw
Gate
.
<EOS>
They
had
just
been
riding
round
the
walls
,
and
Rupert
had
given
orders
that
all
the
colours
taken
in
the
assault
should
be
brought
to
him
.
<EOS>
They
proved
to
be
twenty
-
two
in
number
,
and
all
had
been
displayed
at
the
Leaguer
of
Lathom
.
<EOS>
"What
of
Rigby
?
"
cried
the
earl
,
as
Standish
came
up
.
<EOS>
"He
has
fled
to
Bury
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"And
left
his
army
to
perish
!
<EOS>
Ignoble
dastard
!
"
exclaimed
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
has
baulked
my
vengeance
by
flight
,
"
cried
the
earl
,
with
a
look
of
deep
disappointment
.
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
well
for
him
he
has
got
away
.
<EOS>
But
we
may
meet
again
.
<EOS>
""Think
<EOS>
of
him
no
more
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Rupert
.
<EOS>
"
Think
of
the
countess
—
and
how
overjoyed
she
will
be
at
our
victory
.
<EOS>
You
must
send
her
word
of
it
without
delay
.
<EOS>
""May
<EOS>
I
bear
the
message
to
her
ladyship
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Standish
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"I
would
fain
send
you
,
"
observed
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
be
fatigued
.
<EOS>
""I
have
strength
enough
left
to
reach
Lathom
,
"
rejoined
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
I
pray
your
lordship
not
to
refuse
my
request
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
him
have
his
wish
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
wanted
here
.
<EOS>
Hark
ye
,
Captain
Standish
!
<EOS>
you
shall
do
more
than
convey
a
message
to
the
Countess
of
Derby
from
her
valiant
lord
.
<EOS>
Commend
me
heartily
to
her
ladyship
,
and
present
these
colours
to
her
.
<EOS>
Tell
her
they
have
just
been
taken
at
Bolton
.
<EOS>
""I
will
gladly
obey
your
highness
's
behest
,
"
replied
Standish
,
bowing
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
more
to
say
,
"
pursued
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
set
out
from
Lathom
to
besiege
this
place
,
I
told
her
ladyship
,
when
my
work
was
done
,
I
would
return
and
feast
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
forget
my
promise
.
<EOS>
She
may
expect
me
to-
morrow
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
countess
will
be
enchanted
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
suitable
preparation
can
scarce
be
made
for
your
highness
by
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
preparation
need
be
made
for
me
,
"
said
the
prince
,
"
My
cousin
's
welcome
will
suffice
.
<EOS>
"Well
<EOS>
knowing
the
prince
's
humour
,
Lord
Derby
said
no
more
on
the
subject
,
but
<EOS>
bade
Standish
prepare
for
instant
departure
;
and
Prince
Rupert
enjoined
him
to
take
a
strong
guard
lest
he
should
be
robbed
of
the
colours
.
<EOS>
"Take
the
party
of
dragoons
you
have
just
brought
back
with
you
from
the
pursuit
of
Rigby
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
Proud
of
his
errand
,
yet
fearful
of
losing
the
flags
,
which
he
committed
to
the
care
of
the
stoutest
men
in
the
troop
,
Standish
departed
.
<EOS>
After
the
dreadful
scenes
he
had
recently
wit
-
nessed
,
and
knew
were
still
being
enacted
in
the
town
,
he
was
not
sorry
to
leave
Bolton
behind
.
<EOS>
Speeding
across
the
moor
he
soon
reached
Lostock
,
and
found
the
place
abandoned
.
<EOS>
From
Lostock
Standish
took
his
way
across
the
country
to
Haigh
,
and
thence
to
Wrightington
,
and
he
was
close
upon
Newburgh
,
when
he
saw
a
horseman
coming
towards
him
,
whom
even
at
a
distance
he
recognised
as
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
the
party
of
dragoons
,
Rosworm
would
have
galloped
off
,
but
a
shout
from
Standish
checked
him
,
and
he
waited
tranquilly
till
the
young
man
came
up
.
<EOS>
A
brief
colloquy
then
took
place
between
them
—
being
so
conducted
that
it
could
not
be
overheard
by
the
troopers
,
who
had
likewise
halted
.
<EOS>
"I
can
give
you
a
good
account
of
your
friends
,
"
said
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
left
them
at
Lathom
House
.
<EOS>
The
journey
there
was
not
difficult
,
since
I
was
fortunately
able
to
procure
horses
for
them
at
Great
Lever
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
did
you
not
remain
at
Lathom
as
I
advised
?
"
asked
Standish
.
<EOS>
"I
had
reasons
for
not
doing
so
,
"
replied
Ros
-
worm
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
now
going
to
Wigan
.
<EOS>
But
what
has
happened
to
Bolton?""Bolton
has
fallen
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
Hundreds
have
been
slain
,
but
Rigby
has
escaped
to
Bury
.
<EOS>
""Lathom
<EOS>
has
proved
unlucky
to
him
in
every
way
,
"
observed
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
gained
nothing
during
the
siege
,
and
now
he
has
lost
all
at
Bolton
.
<EOS>
""I
should
have
been
satisfied
if
we
had
slain
him
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
lives
to
do
us
more
mischief
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
much
,
I
think
,
"
said
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
be
gone
.
<EOS>
Night
is
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Farewell
for
ever
!
<EOS>
It
is
not
likely
we
shall
meet
again
.
<EOS>
""Wherefore
<EOS>
not
?
"
demanded
Standish
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
shall
leave
this
country
,
"
replied
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sick
of
the
war
.
<EOS>
""If
you
had
seen
Bolton
to
-
day
you
would
have
had
enough
of
it
,
"
observed
Standish
,
in
a
sombre
voice
.
<EOS>
"I
am
glad
I
had
left
before
the
second
assault
began
,
"
said
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
another
reason
for
leaving
this
country
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
has
warned
me
to
return
to
my
native
land
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
her
twice
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
fancy
<EOS>
so
.
<EOS>
""I
am
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
obey
.
<EOS>
Again
,
farewell!"No
more
passed
between
them
.
<EOS>
Rosworm
rode
off
,
and
Standish
proceeded
to
Lathom
House
,
which
was
not
much
more
than
a
mile
distant
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
VIIHow
the
Colours
taken
at
Bolton
were
presented
to
the
CountessNEWS
had
reached
the
countess
and
the
officers
of
the
garrison
that
Prince
Rupert
and
the
earl
had
been
repulsed
,
and
though
they
did
not
credit
the
rumour
,
it
caused
them
great
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
Their
delight
may
therefore
be
imagined
when
Standish
arrived
and
announced
that
Bolton
had
been
taken
on
the
second
assault
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
dragoons
rode
into
the
court
carrying
the
colours
of
the
enemy
—
colours
they
instantly
recognised
—
their
enthusiasm
knew
no
bounds
.
<EOS>
The
good
news
was
instantly
conveyed
to
the
countess
by
Major
Farrington
,
who
told
her
that
Bolton
had
been
taken
,
and
that
both
Prince
Rupert
and
Lord
Derby
were
unhurt
.
<EOS>
For
once
the
heroic
lady
's
firmness
forsook
her
.
<EOS>
She
who
had
so
often
faced
danger
unmoved
,
and
had
borne
so
many
trials
with
unshaken
constancy
,
now
felt
ready
to
sink
.
<EOS>
But
by
a
great
effort
she
regained
her
self
-
possession
,
and
observed
to
Major
Farrington:"You
<EOS>
say
Captain
Standish
has
brought
this
good
news
.
<EOS>
Why
does
he
not
come
to
me
himself?""He
<EOS>
brings
your
ladyship
a
present
from
Prince
Rupert
,
and
desires
to
deliver
it
to
you
before
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
hearing
this
the
countess
immediately
went
forth
,
accompanied
by
her
daughters
,
by
her
chaplains
,
and
by
Don
Fortunio
and
Engracia
.
<EOS>
At
the
entrance
of
the
mansion
stood
all
her
officers
ready
to
attend
her
.
<EOS>
The
court
-
yard
was
thronged
with
the
soldiers
of
the
garrison
,
who
had
hastily
assembled
to
witness
a
scene
of
the
deepest
interest
to
them
.
<EOS>
In
front
of
the
musketeers
were
the
dragoons
who
had
just
arrived
.
<EOS>
The
latter
were
still
on
horseback
,
and
each
man
in
the
foremost
line
carried
a
flag
.
<EOS>
Standish
had
dismounted
,
and
was
stationed
a
few
yards
in
advance
of
the
troop
.
<EOS>
Greatly
touched
by
this
spectacle
,
the
countess
marched
on
till
she
came
within
a
short
distance
of
the
dragoons
,
and
then
stood
still
,
while
Standish
with
his
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
,
advanced
to
meet
her
and
made
a
profound
obeisance
.
<EOS>
Speaking
in
a
loud
voice
that
all
might
hear
,
he
said:"It
will
rejoice
you
to
learn
,
madam
,
and
it
will
rejoice
your
brave
soldiers
to
hear
,
that
Bolton
has
been
taken
after
a
sharp
conflict
,
and
all
the
garrison
put
to
the
sword
.
<EOS>
A
great
victory
has
thus
been
gained
over
the
rebels
,
and
a
blow
dealt
them
from
which
they
will
not
speedily
recover
.
<EOS>
"Here
<EOS>
he
was
interrupted
for
a
few
moments
by
the
shouts
of
the
soldiers
,
after
which
he
went
on
.
"My
<EOS>
lord
,
though
first
to
enter
the
gate
,
and
exposed
to
the
sharpest
fire
,
is
happily
unhurt
,
and
charges
me
to
inform
your
ladyship
that
he
will
return
to
Lathom
to
-
morrow
,
and
bring
his
highness
Prince
Rupert
with
him
.
<EOS>
""They
will
be
right
welcome
to
us
all
,
"
said
the
countess
.
<EOS>
Loud
shouts
again
resounded
.
<EOS>
But
Standish
had
not
yet
finished
.
<EOS>
"I
am
commanded
by
Prince
Rupert
,
"
he
said
,
"
to
present
to
your
ladyship
these
colours
,
which
have
just
been
taken
from
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
"Meanwhile
<EOS>
all
the
flags
having
been
collected
by
a
couple
of
dragoons
,
who
had
dismounted
for
the
purpose
,
were
laid
at
the
countess
's
feet
.
<EOS>
Her
cheeks
flushed
,
and
her
eyes
blazed
as
she
regarded
them
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
last
these
colours
are
ours
,
"
she
cried
,
taking
one
from
the
heap
,
and
waving
it
triumphantly
to
the
shouting
soldiers
.
<EOS>
There
was
great
rejoicing
that
night
in
Lathom
House
,
and
the
countess
promised
the
soldiers
that
their
cups
should
again
be
filled
with
ale
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
Standish
had
little
private
converse
with
Engracia
,
but
he
thought
she
looked
sad
.
<EOS>
He
fancied
the
captivity
at
Bolton
had
made
a
painful
impression
on
her
,
and
told
her
so
;
but
she
said
he
was
mistaken
.
<EOS>
"These
<EOS>
occurrences
have
troubled
my
father
more
than
me
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
resolved
to
return
to
Spain
immediately
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
take
you
with
him?""Of
course
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
leave
me
behind
.
<EOS>
I
fear
we
shall
be
obliged
to
part
,
unless
you
will
come
with
us
to
Spain
.
<EOS>
""I
have
already
told
you
I
can
not
forsake
my
own
country
at
this
juncture
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
where
my
lord
leads
me
.
<EOS>
He
has
more
towns
to
assault
—
more
battles
to
fight
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
will
certainly
be
killed
.
<EOS>
Now
in
Spain
you
might
live
tranquilly
.
<EOS>
""I
will
go
there
when
this
campaign
is
ended
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
will
it
end
?
<EOS>
Never
!
<EOS>
My
father
is
quite
tired
out
,
and
to
speak
truth
<EOS>
so
am
I.
<EOS>
I
shall
grieve
to
quit
the
countess
and
her
daughters
,
who
have
been
so
kind
to
me
—
but
I
must
go
.
<EOS>
""Perhaps
you
may
change
your
mind
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
not
think
I
shall
—
but
even
if
I
did
,
my
father
wo
n't
stay
.
<EOS>
He
intends
to
go
to
Liverpool
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
Liverpool
is
in
the
hands
of
the
rebels
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
he
will
go
elsewhere
,
and
try
to
find
a
vessel
bound
for
Spain
.
<EOS>
He
means
to
consult
the
Earl
of
Derby
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
""At
<EOS>
first
I
thought
you
were
jesting
with
me
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
begin
to
fear
you
are
quite
serious
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
father
is
,
and
therefore
I
must
obey
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
you
can
persuade
him
to
remain
,
if
you
choose
.
<EOS>
""No
—
he
wo
n't
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Rosworm
has
alarmed
him
,
by
telling
him
the
king
is
certain
to
be
defeated
,
and
he
is
all
anxiety
to
be
gone
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
juncture
,
Don
Fortunio
himself
came
up
.
<EOS>
"Papa
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
have
just
been
acquainting
Captain
Standish
with
your
determination
to
leave
England
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
immediately
,
I
hope
?
"
said
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
"Yes
,
immediately
,
"
replied
Don
Fortunio
.
<EOS>
"
I
long
to
get
back
to
Spain
.
<EOS>
If
you
like
this
constant
fighting
,
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
have
very
grave
apprehensions
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
Is
it
treasonable
to
say
you
will
not
long
have
a
king
in
England
?
<EOS>
Such
is
my
conviction
.
<EOS>
""You
are
wrong
,
sir
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
These
rebels
will
be
crushed
.
<EOS>
We
have
begun
the
work
to
-
day
,
and
shall
not
stop
till
it
is
ended

<EOS>
""I
fear
you
will
find
it
a
harder
task
than
you
imagine
,
"
said
Don
Fortunio
.
<EOS>
"Hear
what
the
Earl
of
Derby
has
to
say
,
"
rejoined
Standish
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
he
will
allow
the
countess
and
his
children
to
remain
here
,
I
will
postpone
my
departure

Don
Fortunio

<EOS>
Not
otherwise

"CHAPTER
<EOS>
VIIIAgain
on
the
Eagle
TowerBRIGHT
and
sunshiny
was
the
day
,
and
Lathom
House
had
an
air
of
cheerfulness
such
as
it
had
not
worn
for
months
.
<EOS>
Above
the
Eagle
Tower
floated
the
broad
banner
that
had
never
been
lowered
during
the
siege
—
meet
emblem
of
the
heroic
lady
who
had
placed
it
there
.
<EOS>
The
tower
itself
bore
marks
of
the
enemy
's
shot
,
but
still
rose
proudly
and
firmly
as
ever
.
<EOS>
The
castle
walls
,
however
,
were
terribly
battered
.
<EOS>
Huge
pieces
had
been
knocked
out
of
the
masonry
,
deep
holes
made
by
shot
,
battlements
and
turrets
broken
—
but
not
a
single
enemy
had
set
foot
on
the
ramparts
during
the
long
duration
of
the
Leaguer
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
beyond
the
fosse
,
and
in
the
enemy
's
own
works
,
that
the
evidences
of
destruction
were
most
apparent
.
<EOS>
In
those
partly
demolished
batteries
and
half
-
filled
trenches
could
be
seen
the
tremendous
preparations
made
,
and
how
useless
they
had
proved
.
<EOS>
The
exulting
musketeers
laughed
and
jested
as
they
looked
at
them
from
the
walls
,
and
talked
over
their
own
exploits
.
<EOS>
"
There
stood
the
sconce
that
held
the
great
mortar
that
was
to
crush
us
all
,
"
said
one
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
is
that
bulwark
now
?
<EOS>
Lathom
House
still
stands
—
but
the
beleaguering
army
is
gone
.
<EOS>
""Utterly
<EOS>
destroyed
,
"
observed
another
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
have
got
their
cannon
,
their
mortar
,
and
their
colours
.
<EOS>
"It
was
not
surprising
that
the
soldiers
engaged
in
that
long
siege
should
rejoice
.
<EOS>
Their
courage
had
never
failed
them
,
but
they
might
have
been
forced
by
famine
to
surrender
—
or
have
perished
in
the
burning
stronghold
fired
by
the
hand
of
the
countess
.
<EOS>
All
this
was
over
now
,
and
they
felt
as
men
feel
when
a
great
task
—
almost
beyond
their
powers
—
is
accomplished
.
<EOS>
They
had
done
their
duty
,
and
done
it
well
.
<EOS>
To
their
thinking
no
pleasanter
sight
could
be
seen
on
that
bright
morning
than
was
afforded
by
those
half
-
demolished
batteries
.
<EOS>
To
the
brave
officers
who
had
assisted
in
the
defence
of
the
castle
,
who
had
shrunk
from
no
danger
,
but
were
always
ready
to
sally
forth
upon
the
enemy
—
the
sight
was
equally
agreeable
,
as
the
ruined
fortifications
bore
testimony
to
their
valour
.
<EOS>
But
all
within
the
fortress
rejoiced
on
that
auspicious
morning
—
the
countess
herself
,
her
children
,
her
chaplains
,
her
guests
,
her
household
.
<EOS>
Never
for
a
moment
had
the
heroic
lady
shrunk
from
the
difficult
task
she
had
undertaken
.
<EOS>
Never
at
seasons
of
the
greatest
peril
—
when
ponderous
shot
and
stones
had
been
cast
upon
her
roofs
,
and
fiery
missiles
and
death
-
scattering
shells
had
been
thrown
into
her
courts
—
not
even
when
a
leaden
messenger
of
destruction
had
burst
into
her
own
chamber
,
had
her
stout
heart
failed
her
.
<EOS>
Never
doubting
the
justice
of
her
cause
,
but
relying
entirely
on
Heaven
's
protection
,
she
had
awaited
with
confidence
the
issue
of
the
long
struggle
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
her
loyalty
and
devotion
to
the
royal
cause
were
amply
rewarded
.
<EOS>
Deliverance
came
—
the
insolent
rebels
were
punished
.
<EOS>
Such
were
the
heroic
lady
's
feelings
on
that
morning
—
feelings
that
prompted
her
to
return
thanks
to
Heaven
for
its
mercies
and
protection
.
<EOS>
Two
persons
were
on
the
summit
of
the
Eagle
Tower
gazing
around
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
,
a
lovely
damsel
,
with
dark
lustrous
eyes
and
a
Southern
skin
,
was
listening
with
deep
interest
to
her
companion
who
was
describing
some
of
the
principal
incidents
of
the
siege
,
and
pointing
out
the
localities
to
her
.
"How
<EOS>
enchanted
<EOS>
you
must
be
that
the
siege
is
over
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
as
he
concluded
his
narration
.
"Yes
,
but
there
was
great
excitement
about
it
,
"
replied
Standish
.
"
<EOS>
A
nocturnal
sortie
,
such
as
I
have
just
described
,
is
quite
a
pleasant
pastime
.
<EOS>
We
kept
the
besiegers
in
a
constant
state
of
alarm
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
suppose
you
had
been
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
Suppose
the
enemy
had
driven
you
back
,
or
captured
you
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
suppose
an
impossibility
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
never
did
drive
us
back
.
<EOS>
In
every
conflict
we
had
with
them
they
got
the
worst
of
it
.
<EOS>
Good
fortune
always
attended
us
.
<EOS>
We
rarely
lost
a
man
,
but
generally
left
twenty
killed
behind
us
,
and
sometimes
brought
away
prisoners
.
<EOS>
Now
you
must
own
that
a
sortie
is
exciting
.
<EOS>
""When
<EOS>
I
look
at
those
dreadful
trenches
,
I
wonder
you
ever
got
across
them
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
trenches
were
the
worst
part
of
it
,
"
observed
Standish
;
"
and
I
wonder
I
did
not
find
a
grave
in
them
.
<EOS>
But
happily
the
siege
is
over
,
and
since
most
of
us
are
unhurt
,
we
can
afford
to
laugh
at
its
perils
.
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
enough
?
<EOS>
Will
you
descend?""Stay
a
moment
,
"
cried
Engracia
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
,
and
here
it
ought
to
be
said
.
<EOS>
You
have
fought
well
in
those
entrenchments
and
have
escaped
with
life
,
but
you
may
not
be
always
equally
lucky
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
wise
you
will
play
no
more
at
this
hazardous
game
of
war—""But
I
can
not
retire
,
unless
with
my
lord
's
consent

"
he
interrupted
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
would
dispense
with
my
services
,
I
would
accompany
you
to
Spain
.
<EOS>
""Ask
<EOS>
him
to
free
you
from
your
engagement
,
and
I
am
certain
he
will
do
it
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"I
know
not
that
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
need
of
faithful
followers
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
he
will
be
willing
to
part
with
me
;
and
unless
he
consents
,
I
can
not
go
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
will
you
ask
him?""I
like
not
to
do
so
,
fearing
a
refusal
.
<EOS>
""He
can
not
refuse
you
after
what
you
have
done

<EOS>
""I
have
some
claim

have
the
strongest
claim
upon
his
gratitude

<EOS>
Without

Lathom
House

not

been
held

<EOS>
By
the
frequent
successful
sorties
you
have
made
,
you
contributed
materially
to
its
defence
,
as
the
countess
will
be
first
to
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
can
refuse
you
nothing
,
I
repeat
.

you
desire
military
renown

will
remain

""Only
for
a
time

""Ah

she
cried

<EOS>
"
You
prefer
glory
to

<EOS>
""No

by
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
far
happier
with
you
in
Spain

fighting
here

<EOS>
""If

you
really

so

come

she
said
;

CHAPTER
IXHow
Prince
Rupert
visited
Lathom
HouseEARLY
in
the
morning
the
countess
had
received
a
letter
from
her
lord
,
in
which
he
told
her
she
might
expect
him
and
Prince
Rupert
about
noon
;
adding
that
the
prince
would
only
have
a
small
guard
with
him
,
as
the
whole
of
the
forces
on
quitting
Bolton
would
march
to
besiege
Liverpool
,
and
halt
at
Knowsley
and
Prescot
,
where
his
highness
proposed
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
This
intelligence
being
immediately
communicated
to
Major
Farrington
,
he
gave
all
necessary
orders
,
and
long
before
the
hour
appointed
,
everything
was
in
readiness
for
the
reception
of
the
earl
and
his
illustrious
guest
.
<EOS>
The
weather
was
splendid
,
and
the
brilliant
sunshine
heightened
the
effect
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
The
old
mansion
looked
its
best
,
for
the
damage
it
had
sustained
could
scarcely
be
perceived
.
<EOS>
Every
soldier
in
the
garrison
was
on
the
alert
.
<EOS>
Cheery
voices
were
heard
on
all
sides
,
and
the
aspect
of
the
men
was
very
different
from
what
it
had
been
.
<EOS>
As
the
musketeers
gathered
on
the
ramparts
,
or
on
the
towers
of
the
gateway
,
they
had
a
blithe
look
that
bespoke
utter
absence
of
anxiety
.
<EOS>
The
court
-
yard
itself
presented
a
curious
picture
.
<EOS>
Besides
being
crowded
with
soldiers
,
it
contained
several
large
pieces
of
ordnance
taken
from
the
enemy
,
conspicuous
among
them
being
the
great
mortar
.
<EOS>
Officers
and
men
,
and
all
within
the
castle
,
were
eager
to
welcome
their
victorious
lord
and
the
prince
,
but
some
delay
occurred
that
had
not
been
anticipated
.
<EOS>
Noon
arrived
,
but
no
signal
came
from
the
sentinel
on
the
Eagle
Tower
to
announce
that
the
party
was
in
sight
.
<EOS>
Another
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
,
and
it
was
still
the
same
.
<EOS>
As
time
went
on
the
men
grew
impatient
,
and
the
countess
herself
began
to
feel
uneasy
,
and
spoke
to
Standish
,
who
instantly
volunteered
to
ride
forth
and
ascertain
,
if
he
could
,
the
cause
of
the
delay
.
<EOS>
Just
then
,
however
,
a
joyous
shout
was
heard
without
,
announcing
that
the
party
could
be
descried
.
<EOS>
An
extraordinary
agitation
then
pervaded
the
entire
garrison
,
and
it
continued
till
the
bruit
of
trumpets
proclaimed
the
approach
of
Lord
Derby
and
the
prince
.
<EOS>
A
response
was
instantly
given
from
the
towers
and
battlements
of
the
gateway
,
and
amid
the
thunder
of
artillery
,
that
drowned
the
shouts
of
the
soldiers
,
the
prince
and
the
earl
rode
into
the
court
.
<EOS>
They
were
preceded
by
a
troop
of
lancers
,
and
followed
by
a
dozen
Cavaliers
,
whose
accoutrements
were
almost
as
superb
as
those
of
Rupert
himself
,
and
who
were
equally
well
mounted
.
<EOS>
These
formed
the
prince
's
guard
of
honour
.
<EOS>
Behind
them
came
another
troop
of
lancers
.
<EOS>
The
musketeers
were
now
drawn
up
in
double
line
,
and
as
the
earl
and
his
guest
passed
through
their
ranks
the
court
resounded
with
acclamations
.
<EOS>
Alighting
first
,
Lord
Derby
held
the
prince
's
bridle
,
while
the
latter
dismounted
.
<EOS>
Major
Farrington
then
came
forward
,
and
bidding
Prince
Rupert
welcome
in
the
countess
's
name
,
besought
permission
to
conduct
his
highness
to
the
presence
-
chamber
,
where
he
would
find
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
The
vast
chamber
to
which
the
prince
was
ushered
through
a
crowd
of
attendants
,
really
presented
a
very
striking
appearance
,
being
hung
round
by
the
colours
just
taken
at
Bolton
,
and
adorned
by
some
other
trophies
won
from
the
enemy
during
the
siege
.
<EOS>
At
the
further
end
of
the
room
,
in
a
chair
of
state
,
sat
Lady
Derby
,
surrounded
by
her
daughters
,
her
chaplains
,
and
her
officers
—
the
latter
being
in
their
full
accoutrements
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
richly
attired
,
but
had
no
diamonds
to
display
.
<EOS>
As
the
prince
drew
near
she
arose
,
and
advancing
to
meet
him
,
made
him
a
profound
reverence
.
<EOS>
"Nay
<EOS>
,
madam
,
"
said
Rupert
taking
her
hand
,
and
pressing
it
to
his
lips
,
"
this
ceremony
is
unneeded
.
<EOS>
I
care
not
for
show
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
desire
to
do
your
highness
honour
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
evince
my
gratitude
.
<EOS>
You
have
succoured
me
,
and
punished
my
enemies
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
enemies
were
beaten
before
I
arrived
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
And
they
have
been
punished
by
your
husband
not
by
me
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
was
first
to
enter
Bolton
,
and
the
work
of
vengeance
was
half
performed
ere
<EOS>
I
took
part
in
it
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
highness
gives
me
far
more
credit
than
is
my
due
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Undoubtedly
,
I
did
my
best
,
and
had
I
not
succeeded
in
the
assault
,
I
should
not
now
be
here
.
<EOS>
But
what
are
my
achievements
compared
with
those
of
my
heroic
wife?""Ay
,
my
lord
,
you
may
well
be
proud
of
her
,
"
said
Rupert
.
<EOS>
"
No
other
woman
in
England
could
have
braved
such
a
general
as
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
speak
of
Rigby
and
the
others
,
though
they
were
formidable
.
<EOS>
""I
am
sorry
Rigby
has
escaped
,
"
observed
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
will
always
be
an
enemy
.
<EOS>
""I
will
have
him
yet
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
let
us
not
mar
our
victory
by
other
thoughts
.
<EOS>
"Tenderly
embracing
his
children
,
he
exchanged
cordial
greetings
with
Don
Fortunio
and
his
daughter
,
and
with
the
chaplains
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
officers
composing
the
prince
's
body
-
guard
had
been
conducted
to
the
great
banqueting
-
hall
,
where
an
excellent
repast
was
set
before
them
,
and
they
were
still
partaking
of
it
when
the
party
came
forth
from
the
presence-
chamber
.
<EOS>
All
arose
,
and
raising
their
glasses
,
drank
to
the
noble
Lady
of
Lathom
.
<EOS>
Prince
Rupert
having
expressed
a
desire
to
examine
the
state
of
the
fortress
,
he
was
conducted
over
it
by
the
Earl
of
Derby
and
the
countess
,
attended
by
Major
Farrington
,
Standish
,
and
some
other
officers
.
<EOS>
Mounting
to
the
ramparts
,
the
prince
carefully
examined
the
enemy
's
entrenchments
and
batteries
,
and
then
said
to
the
countess:"The
engineering
work
has
been
well
done
.
<EOS>
With
such
skilful
preparations
,
aided
by
the
veteran
soldiers
who
composed
the
Leaguer
,
the
fortress
ought
to
have
been
taken
.
<EOS>
""Ought
to
have
been
taken
?
"
exclaimed
the
countess
,
surprised
.
<EOS>
"Ay
<EOS>
—
under
ordinary
circumstances
it
would
infallibly
have
been
taken
.
<EOS>
Had
I
not
seen
it
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
have
believed
that
any
fortified
mansion
could
resist
such
works
as
those
.
<EOS>
That
Lathom
House
has
successfully
withstood
them
proves
that
its
garrison
is
extraordinarily
brave
,
and
its
commander
singularly
skilful
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
it
is
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
pay
no
compliments
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
prince
then
gave
his
reasons
,
why
,
according
to
his
opinion
,
the
place
ought
to
have
been
taken
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
castle
<EOS>
,
I
feel
convinced
,
was
saved
by
the
frequent
and
successful
sorties
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
They
demoralised
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
""All
<EOS>
my
officers
were
eager
to
undertake
those
hazardous
expeditions
,
"
remarked
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
bound
to
say
that
the
boldest
and
most
successful
leader
was
Captain
Standish
.
<EOS>
""Then
much
is
due
to
him
,
"
rejoined
Rupert
.
<EOS>
His
highness
then
complimented
the
officers
of
the
garrison
on
the
valour
and
zeal
they
had
displayed
during
the
siege
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
to
you
,
Captain
Standish
,
"
he
said
,
"
the
important
services
you
have
rendered
merit
some
reward
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
the
command
of
a
regiment
of
horse
,
with
the
rank
of
colonel
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
thank
your
highness
sufficiently
,
"
said
Standish
,
bowing
deeply
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
now
reached
the
height
of
my
ambition
.
<EOS>
""No
,
I
am
much
mistaken
if
you
do
not
soon
become
a
brigadier
-
general
.
<EOS>
Promotion
comes
quickly
during
this
war
,
and
you
are
certain
to
distinguish
yourself
.
"Standish
<EOS>
again
bowed
deeply
.
<EOS>
"In
conferring
this
well
-
merited
distinction
on
my
brave
captain
<EOS>
,
"
said
the
countess
,
"
your
highness
is
not
aware
that
you
are
helping
to
keep
him
in
his
majesty
's
service
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
so
?
"
cried
the
prince
,
surprised
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
meant
to
retire
.
<EOS>
Don
Fortunio
Alava
and
his
daughter
are
about
to
return
to
Spain
,
and
he
wished
to
accompany
them
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
is
enamoured
of
that
dark
-
eyed
damsel
?
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
him
answer
for
himself
,
"
observed
the
countess
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"Your
highness
has
guessed
the
truth
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
Spain
to
be
married
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
go
so
far
?
"
<EOS>
laughed
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
Why
not
be
married
here?""The
<EOS>
Señorita
Engracia
prefers
Seville
,
your
highness
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
she
will
remain
here
when
she
finds
you
can
not
go

<EOS>
""I
have
failed
to
persuade
her
.
<EOS>
""Present
<EOS>
her
and
Don
Fortunio
Alava
to
me
,
and
<EOS>
I
will
try
what
I
can
do
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
Standish
gladly
obeyed
,
and
shortly
afterwards
the
fair
Spanish
damsel
and
her
father
were
presented
to
the
prince
,
who
received
them
very
graciously
.
<EOS>
"You
are
about
to
return
to
Spain
<EOS>
I
understand
,
señor
,
"
he
observed
to
Don
Fortunio
.
<EOS>
"As
soon
as
I
can
obtain
a
passage
to
Cadiz
,
your
highness
.
""I
will
give
you
what
assistance
I
can

"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
not
rob
us
of
your
daughter

<EOS>
""I
can
not
leave
her
behind
,
"
rejoined
Don
Fortunio
.
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
she
is
most
anxious
to
return
.
<EOS>
""Is
this
<EOS>
so
?
"
said
the
prince
to
Engracia
.
<EOS>
She
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
and
added
,
"
Captain
Standish
has
promised
to
accompany
us
.
<EOS>
""He
has
promised
more
than
he
can
perform

observed
the
prince
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
just
received
the
command
of
a
regiment
of
horse

must
remain

<EOS>
"Engracia
<EOS>
glanced
at
her
lover
,
and
read
confirmation
of
what
was
said
in
his
looks

<EOS>
"I
can
not
honourably
retire

he
remarked
.

"Nor

you
urge
him

observed
the

to
Engracia

"I

it
was
all
settled

cried

Standish
can
not
abandon
the
brilliant
career
that
lies
before
him
.
<EOS>
Nor
,
if
you
love
him
,
would
you
have
him
do
so
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
not
,
"
she
cried
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"Then
stay
and
make
him
happy
,
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
Standish
took
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"You
will
not
leave
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
can
not
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
I
must
return
to
Spain
without
you
,
"
said
her
father
,
somewhat
reproachfully
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
you
shall
not
be
long
detained
,
"
cried
the
prince
,
who
seemed
enchanted
with
his
work
.
<EOS>
"
The
marriage
shall
take
place
forthwith
.
<EOS>
If
Lady
Derby
consents
,
the
ceremony
can
be
performed
in
the
castle
chapel
.
<EOS>
I
will
speak
to
her
at
once
.
<EOS>
"Acting
<EOS>
up
to
his
expressed
intention
,
he
went
to
the
countess
,
who
was
in
a
different
part
of
the
hall
,
and
though
under
ordinary
circumstances
she
would
have
made
many
objections
,
she
yielded
to
his
representations
,
and
it
was
arranged
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
in
the
chapel
at
an
early
hour
next
morning
.
<EOS>
To
obviate
all
religious
scruples
,
it
was
likewise
arranged
that
the
ceremony
should
be
first
performed
by
Archdeacon
Rutter
and
afterwards
according
to
the
ritual
of
the
Church
of
Rome
,
by
a
priest
who
had
found
refuge
in
the
castle
.
<EOS>
This
very
satisfactory
conclusion
being
arrived
at
,
Standish
heartily
thanked
the
prince
,
and
told
his
highness
he
had
made
him
the
happiest
of
men
.
<EOS>
Her
work
being
fully
accomplished
,
the
heroic
Countess
of
Derby
had
no
longer
any
desire
to
remain
at
Lathom
;
and
since
the
earl
was
about
to
accompany
Prince
Rupert
to
besiege
Liverpool
,
she
proposed
to
relinquish
the
command
of
the
garrison
to
Captain
Rawsthorne
,
and
repair
with
her
daughters
and
a
portion
of
her
household
to
the
Isle
of
Man
,
and
there
recruit
her
health
,
which
had
somewhat
suffered
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
left
Standish
in
command
of
the
garrison
,
but
Prince
Rupert
preferred
that
he
should
be
actively
employed
.
<EOS>
It
was
therefore
arranged
that
apartments
should
be
assigned
him
at
Knowsley
,
which
could
be
occupied
by
his
wife
during
his
absence
.
<EOS>
All
these
plans
were
discussed
and
settled
before
the
grand
banquet
that
took
place
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
XHow
a
Banquet
was
given
in
the
Great
Hall
,
and
a
Bonfire
lighted
in
the
Court-
yardONCE
more
,
and
almost
for
the
last
time
,
that
great
hall
was
filled
with
company
,
and
when
the
health
of
the
Earl
of
Derby
and
his
countess
was
drunk
,
the
roof
resounded
with
such
cheers
as
had
never
been
heard
there
before
—
cheers
that
astonished
even
Prince
Rupert
himself
,
by
whom
the
toast
was
proposed
.
<EOS>
The
lower
tables
were
crowded
with
musketeers
,
and
by
them
the
deafening
,
clamour
was
raised
.
<EOS>
"God
<EOS>
save
the
Earl
and
Countess
of
Derby
,
"
they
shouted
,
"
and
deliver
them
from
their
enemies!"At
the
head
of
the
upper
table
,
in
a
raised
chair
,
with
the
earl
and
countess
on
either
side
,
sat
Prince
Rupert
,
whose
deportment
well
fitted
him
for
the
position
he
occupied
.
<EOS>
His
manner
was
haughty
,
but
not
wanting
in
dignity
,
and
his
military
bearing
pleased
the
soldiers
of
the
garrison
,
who
looked
upon
him
as
the
great
leader
of
the
Royalists
,
and
firmly
believed
he
would
give
the
king
back
the
power
of
which
the
rebels
had
deprived
him
.
<EOS>
Prince
Rupert
was
their
hope
,
and
the
success
that
had
hitherto
attended
his
arms
,
fully
warranted
their
reliance
on
him
.
<EOS>
When
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
therefore
,
proposed
Prince
Rupert
's
health
,
describing
him
as
the
deliverer
of
the
countess
,
and
the
victor
of
Bolton
,
who
would
speedily
free
the
country
from
its
enemies
,
their
shouts
were
as
loud
as
before
,
and
it
was
evident
that
in
their
breasts
burnt
the
flame
of
loyalty
.
<EOS>
While
thanking
them
,
the
prince
remarked
,
"
I
can
not
praise
you
more
than
by
saying
you
are
worthy
followers
of
a
brave
mistress
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
fortunate
in
being
commanded
by
the
Countess
of
Derby
,
she
was
equally
fortunate
in
having
such
soldiers
as
you
.
<EOS>
But
forget
not
what
you
owe
to
your
officers
.
<EOS>
Had
it
not
been
for
their
valour
and
skill
<EOS>
we
might
not
be
here
now
.
<EOS>
"All
<EOS>
the
officers
of
the
garrison
were
seated
at
the
upper
table
,
opposite
the
prince
,
and
on
receiving
this
well
-
merited
tribute
to
their
valour
,
they
arose
and
bowed
to
him
,
while
the
hall
rang
with
renewed
cheers
.
<EOS>
Conspicuous
among
the
guests
at
the
upper
table
were
the
Cavaliers
who
had
accompanied
Prince
Rupert
.
<EOS>
Young
men
of
good
family
,
and
devoted
to
the
royal
cause
,
then
never
gave
quarter
to
a
Roundhead
.
<EOS>
Most
of
them
were
afterwards
killed
at
Marston
Moor
,
but
they
were
now
full
of
life
and
spirits
,
and
enthusiastic
in
their
admiration
of
the
heroism
displayed
by
Lady
Derby
.
<EOS>
But
the
rejoicings
on
the
conclusion
of
the
siege
did
not
terminate
with
the
banquet
.
<EOS>
About
an
hour
after
it
became
dark
,
an
immense
bonfire
composed
of
pieces
of
timber
and
wood
brought
from
the
trenches
was
kindled
in
the
centre
of
the
court
-
yard
,
and
by
the
time
the
pile
was
fairly
alight
,
the
whole
place
was
filled
with
spectators
.
<EOS>
At
the
instance
of
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
Prince
Rupert
,
with
the
countess
and
her
daughters
and
the
whole
of
the
company
,
came
forth
to
witness
the
sight
.
<EOS>
The
effect
was
exceedingly
striking
.
<EOS>
As
the
flames
soared
up
their
reflection
fell
upon
the
crowd
of
musketeers
,
gathered
around
,
upon
others
on
the
walls
,
and
on
the
guard
on
the
gate
-
towers
.
<EOS>
Every
part
of
the
vast
edifice
on
which
the
light
fell
,
was
revealed
as
clearly
as
in
the
daytime
,
and
its
picturesque
character
was
materially
heightened
.
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
the
ramparts
was
singularly
fine
,
and
attracted
much
attention
as
the
company
came
forth
.
<EOS>
So
bright
at
this
moment
was
the
illumination
caused
by
the
flames
that
the
architecture
of
the
mansion
could
have
been
studied
in
its
minutest
details
.
<EOS>
Even
the
summit
of
the
Eagle
Tower
was
distinguishable
.
<EOS>
When
at
their
highest
,
the
flames
rose
above
the
ramparts
,
producing
all
the
effect
of
a
conflagration
.
<EOS>
Seen
far
and
wide
,
they
caused
great
alarm
amongst
distant
beholders
,
and
many
of
the
earl
's
old
tenants
and
retainers
,
thinking
Lathom
House
on
fire
,
hurried
to
the
spot
to
render
assistance
.
<EOS>
Admitted
to
the
court
-
yard
,
they
were
thanked
for
their
zeal
,
and
not
permitted
to
depart
till
they
had
drank
the
health
of
the
earl
and
countess
.
<EOS>
Thus
ended
a
memorable
day
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XIOf
the
Marriage
that
took
place
in
the
ChapelNOTWITHSTANDING
the
festivity
of
the
previous
night
<EOS>
the
garrison
was
astir
at
the
usual
early
hour
,
and
Prince
Rupert
,
who
quitted
his
couch
betimes
,
made
another
survey
of
the
fortress
with
the
earl
,
being
accompanied
on
this
occasion
by
Captain
Rawsthorne
,
to
whom
he
made
some
suggestions
.
<EOS>
His
highness
likewise
inspected
the
garrison
,
highly
commending
the
men
;
and
examined
the
stores
,
which
were
far
better
supplied
than
he
expected
.
<EOS>
All
this
took
place
before
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Later
on
in
the
day
,
though
still
at
an
early
hour
,
the
marriage
,
previously
arranged
,
took
place
in
the
chapel
,
and
Colonel
Standish
was
united
to
the
lovely
object
of
his
affections
.
<EOS>
The
ceremony
was
twice
performed
in
the
presence
of
the
Earl
and
Countess
of
Derby
,
Prince
Rupert
,
and
all
the
officers
of
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
The
bride
was
given
away
by
her
father
,
Don
Fortunio
Alava
,
the
young
ladies
Stanley
acting
as
bridesmaids
.
<EOS>
Attired
in
white
satin
,
and
wearing
a
white
veil
instead
of
her
customary
black
silk
mantilla
,
Engracia
looked
charming
.
<EOS>
While
kneeling
at
the
altar
,
her
attitude
was
full
of
grace
,
and
when
she
raised
her
magnificent
eyes
towards
her
husband
all
were
struck
by
their
splendour
.
<EOS>
The
young
Cavaliers
,
whose
brave
hearts
were
not
unsusceptible
of
lighter
emotions
,
envied
him
his
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
The
ceremony
,
though
twice
as
long
as
usual
,
was
over
at
last
,
and
when
Standish
came
forth
with
his
bride
,
he
found
the
court
filled
with
soldiers
,
most
of
whom
had
accompanied
him
in
his
sallies
on
the
besiegers
.
<EOS>
They
now
pressed
forward
to
wish
him
all
happiness
.
<EOS>
Similar
manifestations
of
attachment
accompanied
him
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
Again
there
was
a
large
assemblage
in
the
banqueting
-
hall
,
but
the
repast
was
not
so
substantial
as
that
on
the
previous
day
,
nor
did
it
last
so
long
.
<EOS>
When
their
health
had
been
drunk
,
bride
and
bridegroom
disappeared
,
and
not
long
afterwards
they
might
have
been
seen
on
the
way
to
Knowsley
.
<EOS>
A
single
steed
carried
them
,
and
the
noble
animal
did
not
seem
to
heed
the
double
burden
.
<EOS>
They
were
attended
by
a
couple
of
troopers
,
one
of
whom
had
charge
of
Maria
.
<EOS>
Eager
to
reach
their
destination
<EOS>
they
did
not
loiter
on
the
way
.
<EOS>
Since
solitude
is
sought
by
every
newly
-
married
pair
,
Standish
and
his
bride
must
have
been
supremely
happy
at
Knowsley
,
for
they
had
the
large
mansion
entirely
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
Only
old
Randal
Fermor
to
wait
upon
them
—
only
Maria
to
attend
on
her
young
mistress
.
<EOS>
No
one
was
to
be
seen
in
the
great
hall
,
on
the
stair
-
case
,
or
in
the
grand
gallery
.
<EOS>
No
one
met
them
on
the
terrace
,
in
the
garden
,
or
on
the
borders
of
the
lake
.
<EOS>
Time
was
not
allowed
them
to
tire
of
this
paradise
—
for
such
it
seemed
.
<EOS>
On
the
third
day
,
the
Countess
of
Derby
arrived
,
bringing
her
daughters
with
her
,
her
chaplain
,
Archdeacon
Rutter
,
and
a
large
portion
of
her
household
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
was
likewise
accompanied
by
Don
Fortunio
,
who
had
come
to
bid
his
daughter
adieu
,
preparatory
to
his
departure
to
Spain
.
<EOS>
As
the
countess
was
attended
by
a
guard
of
twenty
men
,
the
deserted
mansion
seemed
peopled
at
once
.
<EOS>
Its
quietude
was
gone
.
<EOS>
The
change
,
however
,
mattered
little
to
Standish
.
<EOS>
His
brief
season
of
felicity
was
ended
.
<EOS>
On
the
same
day
came
an
order
from
Prince
Rupert
requiring
him
to
join
the
army
immediately
at
Liverpool
.
<EOS>
He
felt
most
unwilling
to
obey
.
<EOS>
His
bride
sought
to
detain
him
,
but
he
broke
from
her
arms
,
and
set
forth
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
XIIThe
Siege
of
LiverpoolON
approaching
Liverpool
,
Standish
found
that
Prince
Rupert
had
fixed
his
camp
round
the
Beacon
,
which
was
situated
on
the
top
of
a
hill
about
a
mile
from
the
town
.
<EOS>
At
the
period
in
question
,
the
great
and
wealthy
town
,
now
the
chief
commercial
port
in
the
kingdom
,
and
the
abode
of
merchant
princes
,
was
then
almost
in
its
infancy
.
<EOS>
But
its
inhabitants
were
remarkably
active
and
enterprising
,
the
position
of
the
port
on
the
Mersey
was
admirably
chosen
,
and
even
then
there
were
indications
of
the
future
greatness
and
importance
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
Viewed
from
the
Beacon
Hill
,
Liverpool
did
not
look
very
strongly
fortified
,
and
Prince
Rupert
persuaded
himself
he
should
easily
take
it
,
but
he
found
the
task
more
difficult
than
he
expected
.
<EOS>
The
town
possessed
a
large
garrison
,
commanded
by
Colonel
Moore
,
who
had
previously
assisted
at
the
Leaguer
of
Lathom
.
<EOS>
The
governor
had
fifteen
hundred
men
with
him
,
of
whom
a
third
were
cavalry
,
and
fresh
supplies
derived
from
Manchester
,
were
sent
by
water
from
Warrington
.
<EOS>
Thus
he
was
enabled
to
make
a
formidable
defence
.
<EOS>
Like
Bolton
and
all
the
other
towns
in
Lancashire
garrisoned
by
the
Parliament
,
Liverpool
was
surrounded
by
high
mud
walls
and
a
deep
ditch
.
<EOS>
These
fortifications
formed
a
semicircle
,
commencing
with
the
river
,
inclosing
Dale
-
street
,
and
continuing
to
some
low
marshy
ground
,
on
the
edge
of
which
batteries
were
erected
.
<EOS>
At
the
entrances
to
all
the
streets
were
gates
protected
by
cannon
.
<EOS>
On
the
south
there
was
a
strong
castle
containing
the
garrison
,
surrounded
by
a
deep
fosse
,
by
means
of
which
stores
could
be
brought
in
.
<EOS>
Heavy
ordnance
were
placed
on
the
walls
commanding
the
river
,
and
the
port
was
further
protected
by
a
battery
mounting
eight
guns
.
<EOS>
The
ships
in
the
harbour
were
likewise
fitted
up
to
defend
the
town
on
thè
river
side
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
it
will
be
seen
that
Liverpool
,
owing
to
its
situation
on
the
Mersey
,
had
advantages
possessed
by
no
other
town
in
Lancashire
,
but
it
was
somewhat
exposed
on
the
land
side
.
<EOS>
As
an
additional
protection
from
the
shot
of
the
besiegers
,
the
walls
were
covered
with
large
bags
of
wool
,
brought
by
the
fugitive
Protestants
from
Ireland
after
the
massacres
.
<EOS>
When
Standish
joined
the
prince
,
the
siege
had
already
begun
.
<EOS>
Expecting
to
take
the
place
by
a
coup
de
main
,
and
not
anticipating
such
vigorous
resistance
as
he
found
from
Governor
Moore
,
Rupert
made
a
furious
assault
on
the
gate
at
the
end
of
Dale
-
street
,
while
another
gate
was
attacked
with
equal
fury
by
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
Both
leaders
were
repulsed
,
and
with
considerable
loss
,
and
the
prince
was
still
burning
with
rage
at
the
defeat
,
when
Standish
arrived
.
<EOS>
Rupert
rarely
held
a
council
of
war
,
but
formed
his
own
judgment
,
and
acted
upon
it
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
consulted
Lord
Derby
as
to
the
prudence
of
a
second
assault
,
and
found
him
exceedingly
averse
to
it
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
recommended
a
regular
siege
with
intrenchments
and
batteries
as
at
Lathom
.
<EOS>
"'Sdeath
!
<EOS>
that
will
occupy
a
month
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rupert
;
"
and
then
we
shall
have
to
storm
the
town
.
<EOS>
""We
<EOS>
shall
not
take
it
otherwise
,
"
said
the

We

Only
by

attacks
shall
we
succeed

<EOS>
"Evidently
<EOS>
dissatisfied
with
the
advice
,
Rupert
was
unwilling
to
adopt
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
all
impatience
to
wipe
out
the
disgrace
of
the
defeat
.
<EOS>
"This
is
not
the
advice
you
gave
me
at
Bolton
,
my
lord
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Then
you
urged
a
second
assault
without
delay
.
<EOS>
No
talk
of
siege
works
.
<EOS>
""Nor
were
they
needed
,
your
highness
,
because
we
knew
a
gate
would
be
opened
to
us

<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
should
not
a
gate
be
opened
to
us
at
Liverpool
?
"
said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
man
must
be
found
to
do
it
,
"
remarked
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"Here
<EOS>
he
is
,
"
said
Rupert
,
as
Standish
,
who
had
just
dismounted
,
entered
the
prince
's
tent
.
<EOS>
After
salutations
had
passed
the
prince
<EOS>
said:"You
have
heard
,
Colonel
Standish
,
that
the
first
attack
on
the
town
has
been
repulsed?""I
have
,
your
highness

"
was
the
reply
.
"
<EOS>
But
your
next
attack
will
be
successful
.
<EOS>
""Lord
<EOS>
Derby
thinks
we
ought
to
proceed
by
a
regular
siege
.
<EOS>
That
is
too
slow
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
join
the
Marquis
of
Newcastle
at
York
and
not
waste
time
here
.
<EOS>
Can
you
open
a
gate
for
us
as
you
did
at
Bolton?""To
do
so
you
must
scale
the
walls
,
"
observed
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
high
and
the
ditch
is
deep
.
<EOS>
The
chances
are
a
thousand

one
against
you
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
more
hazard
the
more
honour
,
"
said
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
If
your
highness
will
give
me
a
detachment
of
your
best
soldiers
,
pontoons
and
scaling
ladders
,
I
will
manage
to
get
to
the
top
of

Once

<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
know
you

said
the
prince
,
well
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
You
believe
you
can
accomplish
what
you
say

<EOS>
But
you
must
see
the
fortifications

judge
ere
you
decide
.
<EOS>
"I
should
like
to
see
them

your
highness

but
I
have
no
doubt
as
to
my
decision

<EOS>
""If
you
hold
to
your
determination

another
assault
shall
be
made
to

morrow

said
the
prince
.
<EOS>
"I
would
not
damp
your
ardour

Colonel
Standish

observed
the
earl

But
if

"CHAPTER
XIIIDeath
of
StandishNEXT
morning
,
before
daybreak
,
in
pursuance
of
the
prince
's
orders
,
the
whole
of
his
force
was
under
arms
,
and
a
general
movement
was
made
towards
the
town
,
but
slowly
and
cautiously
,
so
as
not
to
alarm
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
From
the
Beacon
Hill
,
on
the
brow
of
which
Prince
Rupert
with
the
Earl
of
Derby
and
Lord
Caryl
Molineux
were
stationed
,
the
town
,
with
its
fortifications
,
its
castle
,
fort
,
and
harbour
,
with
the
grand
river
flowing
past
,
could
be
dimly
descried
.
<EOS>
The
three
personages
were
watching
the
advance
of
the
army
,
preparatory
to
joining
the
attack
.
<EOS>
In
the
van
was
a
regiment
of
cuirassiers
,
led
by
Colonel
Standish
,
which
was
marching
towards
the
gate
at
the
entrance
of
Dale
-
street
.
<EOS>
At
this
gate
were
two
large
pieces
of
ordnance
,
and
besides
the
usual
guard
,
it
had
a
troop
of
horse
to
defend
it
.
<EOS>
Facing
it
was
a
battery
,
just
erected
by
the
besiegers
,
that
mounted
three
heavy
guns
.
<EOS>
As
yet
neither
besieged
nor
besiegers
had
fired
a
shot
.
<EOS>
But
the
prince
and
his
companions
did
not
remain
long
near
the
Beacon
.
<EOS>
After
looking
on
for
a
few
minutes
,
they
galloped
down
the
hill
,
and
each
was
at
his
post
before
the
roar
of
the
castle
guns
announced
that
the
advance
of
the
Royalists
was
perceived
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
the
battery
opposite
Dale
-
street
opened
fire
,
and
being
answered
by
the
cannon
of
the
gate
,
a
sort
of
duel
took
place
between
the
engineers
on
either
side
,
that
seemed
likely
to
end
in
favour
of
the
besiegers
,
two
of
their
shot
having
already
burst
through
the
stout
oak
framework
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
other
gates
were
likewise
attacked
by
Lord
Derby
and
Lord
Caryl
Molineux
,
and
defended
with
equal
vigour
.
<EOS>
Several
ineffectual
attempts
were
likewise
made
by
the
besiegers
to
scale
the
walls
by
means
of
ladders
placed
in
pontoons
.
<EOS>
Everywhere
,
indeed
,
the
most
determined
resistance
was
offered
by
the
besieged
,
and
a
ceaseless
fire
was
kept
up
by
them
from
the
walls
,
which
were
shielded
,
as
we
have
described
,
by
bags
of
wool
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
the
large
shot
thrown
by
the
castle
guns
,
caused
great
destruction
wherever
they
alighted
.
<EOS>
Apparently
,
no
advantage
had
been
gained
by
the
Royalists
at
any
point
,
except
at
the
entrance
of
Dale
-
street
,
and
the
captain
of
the
guard
,
fearing
the
gate
would
soon
be
battered
down
,
ordered
the
troop
of
horse
stationed
there
to
sally
forth
and
dislodge
the
cannon
at
the
battery
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
did
the
troop
appear
outside
,
than
Standish
,
shouting
to
his
men
to
follow
,
dashed
forward
sword
in
hand
as
if
to
defend
the
battery
.
<EOS>
His
object
,
however
,
was
to
enter
the
town
,
and
he
succeeded
in
getting
through
the
gate
with
a
dozen
of
his
men
.
<EOS>
The
guard
were
then
cut
down
,
and
the
gate
kept
forcibly
open
till
the
rest
of
the
regiment
had
entered
.
<EOS>
Bidding
his
men
shout
as
lustily
as
they
could
to
announce
their
success
,
Standish
then
galloped
on
into
the
town
,
in
the
full
belief
that
Lord
Derby
or
Prince
Rupert
would
follow
.
<EOS>
As
the
cuirassiers
went
furiously
on
,
a
few
shots
were
fired
at
them
,
but
they
met
with
no
opposition
,
nor
were
they
immediately
pursued
,
for
the
dragoons
remained
at
the
entrance
of
the
street
till
it
was
effectually
barricaded
.
<EOS>
In
effect
,
therefore
,
Standish
and
his
men
were
prisoners
,
though
they
believed
they
had
taken
the
town
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
inhabitants
,
who
were
only
just
astir
,
shared
in
the
belief
,
and
when
they
beheld
this
splendid
regiment
of
cuirassiers
dashing
past
,
they
felt
sure
<EOS>
the
sanguinary
Rupert
had
got
in
,
and
that
a
general
massacre
would
ensue
.
<EOS>
Standish
and
his
followers
stopped
not
either
to
slay
or
plunder
,
but
galloped
furiously
on
to
the
centre
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
A
few
people
were
collected
in
the
marketplace
,
but
they
fled
when
the
Royalist
soldiers
appeared
.
<EOS>
Windows
and
doors
were
speedily
shut
,
as
Standish
halted
beside
the
cross
to
consider
what
should
be
done
next
.
<EOS>
The
alarm
-
bell
now
began
to
ring
violently
,
and
<EOS>
great
consternation
prevailed
throughout
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
The
governor
could
not
ascertain
precisely
what
had
happened
,
though
he
learnt
that
a
regiment
of
cuirassiers
had
entered
the
town
,
and
reached
the
market-
place
.
<EOS>
His
first
order
was
to
send
a
detachment
of
musketeers
from
the
castle
to
attack
them
in
front
,
while
he
himself
cut
off
their
retreat
with
a
squadron
of
dragoons
.
<EOS>
Ere
many
minutes
,
the
market
-
place
became
the
scene
of
a
sharp
conflict
.
<EOS>
On
the
appearance
of
the
musketeers
,
Standish
instantly
charged
them
,
but
was
received
with
a
volley
,
by
which
he
himself
was
severely
wounded
,
and
several
of
his
men
killed
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
he
was
attacked
in
the
rear
by
Colonel
Moore
and
his
dragoons
—
the
governor
calling
to
him
to
surrender
,
and
offering
him
quarter
.
<EOS>
But
Standish
refused
,
and
rallying
his
men
,
who
were
got
into
disorder
,
endeavoured
to
cut
his
way
through
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
succeeded
,
but
his
strength
suddenly
failed
him
,
his
sword
dropped
from
his
grasp
,
and
he
fell
from
his
steed
.
<EOS>
IllustrationIn
<EOS>
the
confusion
of
the
fight
,
he
must
have
been
trampled
under
foot
,
had
not
one
of
his
own
men
,
whose
horse
had
been
shot
,
but
who
was
himself
unwounded
,
dragged
him
to
the
foot
of
the
cross
,
and
there
laid
him
down
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
Colonel
Moore
rode
up
,
and
asked
,
with
much
concern
,
if
he
should
send
a
surgeon
to
him
.
<EOS>
"It
would
be
useless
,
colonel
,
"
replied
Standish
,
faintly
.
<EOS>
"
My
wound
is
mortal,""Have
you
any
request
to
make
?
"
said
Moore
.
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
attended
to
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
young
bride
will
weep
for
me
,
"
replied
Standish
.
<EOS>
"
Send
her
the
ring
on
my
finger
.
<EOS>
It
will
comfort
her
.
<EOS>
""Rest
<EOS>
assured
it
shall
be
done
,
"
said
the
chivalrous
Moore
.
<EOS>
A
cup
of
wine
was
then
offered
to
the
dying
man
.
<EOS>
Taking
it
,
he
raised
it
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
the
king
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Confusion
to
his
enemies!"With
these
words
he
fell
backwards
and
expired
.
<EOS>
Liverpool
was
not
taken
on
that
day
,
nor
for
several
days
to
come
.
<EOS>
Finding
he
could
no
longer
hold
out
,
the
governor
retired
and
Prince
Rupert
entered
the
town
with
his
whole
army
.
<EOS>
In
the
market
-
place
he
found
a
regiment
of
horse
drawn
up
.
<EOS>
Their
leader
offered
to
lay
down
his
arms
,
and
demanded
quarter
,
which
was
granted
,
conditionally
,
on
the
surrender
of
the
castle
.
<EOS>
The
terms
being
acceded
to
,
the
prince
at
once
took
possession
of
the
fortress
.
<EOS>
By
order
of
Colonel
Moore
,
Standish
had
been
buried
in
the
old
church
of
Saint
Nicholas
,
and
his
beautiful
widow
now
came
to
mourn
over
his
grave
.
<EOS>
When
the
news
of
her
loss
had
been
brought
her
,
she
uttered
a
cry
of
anguish
,
swooned
,
and
continued
so
long
insensible
,
that
it
was
thought
she
was
dead
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
her
father
and
Maria
were
with
her
,
and
to
the
care
of
the
latter
she
owed
her
recovery
.
<EOS>
Don
Fortunio
brought
her
and
her
faithful
attendant
to
Liverpool
,
and
after
a
short
stay
there
,
a
vessel
was
found
that
conveyed
them
all
to
Cadiz
.

IThe
Earl
of
Derby
's
last
journeySome
description
appears
necessary
of
the
tragic
death
of
the
illustrious
and
unfortunate
nobleman
who
has
formed
the
principal
figure
in
our
story
.
<EOS>
For
the
details
we
shall
refer
to
two
contemporary
narratives
,
reproduced
by
the
Reverend
Mr.
RAINES
in
his
"
Memoirs
of
James
Earl
of
Derby
,
"
published
by
the
CHETMAN
SOCIETY
—
narratives
justly
described
by
the
learned
editor
as
"
having
no
parallel
in
our
history
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
picture
is
complete
and
perfect
in
itself
,
"
remarks
Mr.
RAINES
;
"
and
it
is
not
extravagant
praise
to
say
that
it
will
retain
its
melancholy
attraction
as
long
as
any
reverence
shall
remain
for
what
is
noble
and
heroic
or
any
pity
for
tenderness
and
constancy
in
the
saddest
reverses
of
fortune
,
in
fact
as
long
as
there
are
hearts
that
can
feel
,
and
eyes
that
can
weep
.
<EOS>
"Seven
years
have
flown
,
years
fraught
with
deepest
interest
.
<EOS>
A
monarch
has
been
beheaded
,
and
his
son
driven
from
his
kingdom
.
<EOS>
Rebellion
has
triumphed
.
<EOS>
The
fatal
battle
of
Worcester
has
been
fought
,
and
the
brave
and
loyal
Earl
of
Derby
,
who
left
his
wife
and
children
in
his
castle
in
Mona
's
rugged
isle
to
aid
the
youthful
Charles
,
has
been
made
prisoner
—
having
surrendered
after
quarter
for
life
had
been
given
by
his
captor
.
<EOS>
Confined
in
Chester
,
and
tried
by
a
court
-
martial
,
the
earl
has
been
doomed
to
death
.
<EOS>
To
add
to
the
severity
of
the
sentence
,
it
has
been
appointed
by
the
judges
that
the
execution
shall
take
place
at
Bolton
,
where
it
is
supposed
the
inhabitants
have
a
strong
vindictive
feeling
towards
the
illustrious
prisoner
.
<EOS>
On
this
point
the
earl
himself
,
fearful
of
being
reviled
by
the
people
of
the
town
,
wrote
thus
to
the
Speaker
of
the
House
of
Parliament:"It
is
a
greater
affliction
to
me
than
death
itself
,
that
I
am
sentenced
to
die
at
Bolton
;
since
the
nation
will
look
upon
me
as
a
sacrifice
for
that
blood
which
some
have
unjustly
cast
upon
me
,
and
from
which
I
hope
I
am
acquitted
in
your
opinion
,
and
the
judgment
of
good
men
,
having
cleared
myself
by
undeniable
evidence
.
<EOS>
At
my
trial
,
it
was
never
mentioned
against
me
,
and
yet
I
am
adjudged
to
suffer
at
Bolton
,
as
if
indeed
I
had
been
guilty
.
<EOS>
"Notwithstanding
<EOS>
this
appeal
,
no
alteration
was
made
.
<EOS>
The
day
of
execution
having
been
fixed
for
Wednesday
,
15th
October
,
1651
,
the
ill
-
fated
earl
set
forth
on
the
day
before
from
Chester
,
escorted
by
a
strong
guard
,
consisting
of
sixty
musketeers
,
and
<EOS>
eighty
horse
—
the
latter
being
well
armed
and
well
mounted
,
and
commanded
by
a
captain
,
notorious
for
his
devotion
to
the
Parliament
.
<EOS>
With
the
earl
were
Mr.
Baguley
,
who
wrote
the
account
of
his
noble
master
's
imprisonment
and
death
;
Paul
Moreau
his
valet
,
and
several
other
faithful
servants
.
<EOS>
To
add
to
the
indignity
shown
him
by
his
malevolent
enemies
,
the
earl
was
provided
with
a
sorry
steed
.
<EOS>
All
who
saw
him
set
out
on
his
last
journey
loudly
expressed
their
grief
—
several
accompanying
to
some
distance
.
<EOS>
On
Hole
Heath
,
not
far
from
Chester
,
the
earl
was
met
by
his
two
younger
daughters
,
the
Lady
Katherine
and
the
Lady
Amelia
Stanley
,
who
came
to
take
a
last
leave
of
him
.
<EOS>
Heedless
of
the
presence
of
the
guard
,
he
flung
himself
from
his
horse
,
embraced
his
daughters
tenderly
,
and
then
knelt
down
beside
their
on
the
road
,
and
prayed
.
<EOS>
On
rising
he
again
pressed
them
to
his
heart
,
and
gave
them
his
last
blessing
.
<EOS>
Such
a
sad
spectacle
has
rarely
been
witnessed
—
such
a
father
—
such
daughters
—
one
so
noble
,
the
others
so
beautiful
,
tender
,
and
loving
.
<EOS>
The
beholders
were
indescribably
affected
by
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Outbursts
of
grief
were
heard
on
all
sides
,
and
numbers
knelt
down
and
prayed
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
the
parting
was
over
.
<EOS>
The
fainting
girls
,
who
had
sustained
themselves
with
difficulty
,
broke
down
in
the
end
,
and
were
borne
away
insensible
.
<EOS>
By
the
help
of
Paul
Moreau
,
the
earl
regained
his
steed
,
and
the
cavalcade
was
once
more
in
motion
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
shake
off
the
impression
made
upon
him
by
the
interview
.
<EOS>
His
head
drooped
on
his
breast
,
and
during
the
whole
of
the
day
's
journey
,
he
scarcely
looked
around
,
or
spoke
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
arranged
that
the
noble
prisoner
should
pass
his
last
night
at
Leigh
—
a
small
town
,
about
six
miles
from
Bolton
.
<EOS>
In
Leigh
Church
had
been
interred
his
friend
and
companion
in
arms
,
the
valiant
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
,
who
was
killed
at
Wigan
,
and
the
earl
greatly
desired
to
visit
the
grave
,
but
the
request
was
denied
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
refusal
troubled
him
little
.
<EOS>
He
had
become
indifferent
to
harsh
treatment
,
and
passed
the
evening
in
tranquil
converse
with
Baguley
.
<EOS>
"Commend
<EOS>
me
to
Archdeacon
Rutter
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
ask
him
if
he
remembers
how
blood
fell
upon
a
book
I
was
reading
late
one
night
in
my
closet
at
Knowsley
?
<EOS>
Ask
him
what
he
now
thinks
of
that
strange
occurrence
?
<EOS>
He
will
answer
,
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
,
that
his
presentiments
have
been
fully
verified
.
<EOS>
Ask
him
further
,
if
he
remembers
I
once
told
him
that
death
in
battle
would
not
trouble
me
,
but
a
blow
on
the
scaffold
would
greatly
startle
me
.
<EOS>
Now
I
have
changed
my
opinion
,
and
can
as
easily
lay
my
head
on
the
block
as
on
a
pillow
.
<EOS>
"After
<EOS>
supper
,
which
he
declared
should
be
his
last
meal
in
this
world
,
the
earl
threw
himself
upon
a
bed
without
taking
off
his
apparel
,
and
while
lying
there
with
his
head
resting
upon
his
right
hand
,
he
compared
himself
to
a
monument
,
adding:"To
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
shall
want
a
monument!"At
an
early
hour
he
arose
and
prayed
.
<EOS>
Before
quitting
Leigh
he
was
joined
by
his
son
,
Lord
Strange
,
who
attended
him
to
Bolton
.
<EOS>
A
sad
ride
thither
,
for
he
was
full
of
uneasiness
as
to
the
reception
he
should
experience
from
the
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
But
his
anxiety
was
speedily
relieved
.
<EOS>
As
they
entered
the
town
,
which
had
a
singularly
dismal
look
,
all
the
persons
he
beheld
expressed
the
deepest
sorrow
.
<EOS>
Far
from
exulting
in
his
death
,
they
uttered
doleful
lamentations
,
and
many
called
out:"O
sad
day
!
<EOS>
O
woful
day
!
<EOS>
Shall
the
good
Earl
of
Derby
die
here
?
<EOS>
Many
sad
losses
have
we
had
in
the
war
,
but
none
like
unto
this
—
for
now
the
ancient
honour
of
our
country
must
suffer
here
at
Bolton
.
<EOS>
"These
<EOS>
unlooked
-
for
expressions
of
sympathy
greatly
consoled
him
,
though
they
forced
tears
to
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
But
the
scaffold
was
not
yet
completed
.
<EOS>
To
inflict
additional
pain
upon
the
earl
,
the
platform
on
which
he
was
to
die
was
constructed
of
timber
brought
from
Lathom
House
,
which
had
been
demolished
after
the
second
siege
.
<EOS>
Not
a
carpenter
in
the
town
would
saw
a
plank
,
strike
a
nail
,
or
lend
any
aid
whatever
.
<EOS>
Of
necessity
,
therefore
,
soldiers
were
employed
,
and
they
were
behind-
hand
with
their
work
.
<EOS>
The
ancient
cross
that
had
hitherto
adorned
the
market
-
place
was
pulled
down
to
make
way
for
the
hateful
structure
,
so
that
the
appearance
of
the
place
was
greatly
changed
.
<EOS>
As
the
cavalcade
halted
,
the
earl
exclaimed:"Venio
Domine
.
<EOS>
I
am
prepared
to
fulfil
thy
will
.
<EOS>
This
scaffold
must
be
my
cross
.
<EOS>
Blessed
Saviour
,
I
take
it
up
willingly
,
and
follow
thee!"Conducted
by
an
officer
to
an
adjoining
house
,
looking
upon
the
church
,
he
was
informed
that
he
would
not
be
disturbed
till
three
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"I
do
not
ask
for
the
delay
,
sir
,
"
said
the
earl
,
"
and
am
quite
ready
now
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
thank
you
.
<EOS>
"Lord
<EOS>
Strange
,
Mr.
Baguley
,
Paul
Moreau
,
and
all
his
attendants
,
entered
the
house
with
him
and
awaited
his
orders
.
<EOS>
The
earl
's
first
request
was
that
they
should
all
join
him
in
prayer
.
<EOS>
Their
devotions
were
much
disturbed
by
the
knocking
and
hammering
of
the
boards
of
the
scaffold
by
the
soldiers
,
and
by
the
loud
talk
of
the
troopers
,
but
in
spite
of
these
noises
he
prayed
long
and
fervently
.
<EOS>
When
he
arose
,
he
retired
into
an
inner
room
with
his
valet
,
Paul
Moreau
,
and
doffing
his
riding
-
dress
and
boots
,
put
on
silken
hose
,
a
rich
velvet
doublet
,
and
a
falling
band
edged
with
lace
.
<EOS>
While
changing
his
linen
he
said
to
Paul
Moreau:"Take
care
that
this
shirt
is
not
taken
from
me
,
but
let
me
be
buried
in
it
.
<EOS>
""It
shall
be
done
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
valet
.
<EOS>
The
earl
then
sent
for
Lord
Strange
,
who
had
brought
him
the
blue
riband
of
the
Garter
,
and
now
helped
him
to
put
it
on
.
<EOS>
"Charles
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
to
his
son
,
"
I
shall
not
wear
this
order
long
,
but
I
desire
to
be
seen
in
it
on
the
scaffold
.
<EOS>
Baguley
will
bring
it
back
to
you
.
<EOS>
Return
it
<EOS>
,
I
pray
you
,
to
my
most
gracious
sovereign
,
and
say
that
I
sent
it
back
to
him
in
all
humility
and
gratitude
—
spotless
as
I
received
it
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
done
,
he
desired
to
be
left
alone
,
and
prayed
in
private
for
nearly
half
an
hour
,
during
which
his
groans
and
interjections
could
be
heard
by
those
in
the
outer
room
,
and
when
he
came
forth
his
eyes
still
bore
traces
of
tears
.
<EOS>
Addressing
those
present
,
he
said:"I
must
now
bid
you
farewell
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Think
not
from
any
signs
of
affliction
you
may
discern
on
my
countenance
that
I
am
unwilling
to
leave
the
world
,
being
well
assured
that
I
shall
be
carried
from
trouble
to
rest
and
peace
—
from
sorrow
to
lasting
bliss
.
<EOS>
Death
has
no
other
bitterness
for
me
save
that
it
takes
me
from
those
I
love
.
<EOS>
But
I
leave
them
to
the
care
and
protection
of
a
better
husband
and
a
better
father
.
<EOS>
As
to
my
relentless
enemies
I
freely
forgive
them
,
and
beseech
Heaven
to
forgive
them
likewise
.
"He
<EOS>
then
called
to
Lord
Strange
,
who
knelt
down
and
received
his
blessing
.
<EOS>
Tenderly
embracing
him
,
when
he
arose
,
the
earl
said:"Farewell
,
dear
son
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
fit
you
should
accompany
me
to
the
scaffold
,
so
I
shall
behold
you
no
more
in
this
world
,
but
I
trust
we
shall
meet
in
Heaven
.
<EOS>
Again
,
I
commend
your
admirable
mother
to
you
.
<EOS>
Farewell!"Then
gently
disengaging
himself
from
Lord
Strange
,
whose
arm
was
still
round
his
neck
,
and
who
was
weeping
bitterly
,
he
bade
Moreau
inform
the
officer
<EOS>
he
was
ready
.
<EOS>
After
a
brief
interval
,
the
door
was
thrown
open
,
and
with
a
firm
footstep
the
earl
commenced
his
march
to
death
,
preceded
by
the
officer
with
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
,
and
followed
by
Baguley
,
Paul
Moreau
,
and
two
other
servants
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIThe
HeadsmanTHE
few
sorrowing
persons
standing
around
,
would
undoubtedly
have
pressed
upon
the
earl
,
or
knelt
down
before
him
,
if
they
had
not
been
prevented
by
the
double
line
of
musketeers
through
which
he
had
to
pass
.
<EOS>
Even
now
the
scaffold
was
scarcely
finished
,
and
not
being
draped
with
black
,
had
a
mean
look
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
was
in
a
great
measure
hidden
by
the
troopers
who
were
drawn
up
round
it
,
with
their
horses
'
heads
turned
towards
the
rails
.
<EOS>
The
executioner
was
already
at
his
post
,
a
churl
who
might
have
been
chosen
for
his
repulsive
countenance
;
or
more
probably
because
no
one
else
would
fill
the
odious
office
.
<EOS>
The
beholders
regarded
the
caitiff
with
loathing
and
horror
,
and
their
execrations
and
opprobrious
epithets
constantly
reached
his
ears
.
<EOS>
From
his
deep
-
sunken
fiery
eyes
,
long
black
upper
lip
,
projecting
teeth
,
and
heavy
jaw
the
fellow
resembled
a
bull
-
dog
.
<EOS>
Habited
in
a
stout
leather
doublet
,
he
wore
a
leather
cap
over
his
closely
-
cropped
hair
.
<EOS>
Near
him
was
the
block
,
beside
which
was
placed
the
axe
—
a
very
heavy
implement
with
an
unusually
short
handle
—
the
blade
being
large
,
convex
in
shape
,
and
exceedingly
keen
.
<EOS>
At
a
little
distance
from
the
block
was
the
coffin
,
the
lid
of
which
had
been
taken
off
.
<EOS>
On
his
way
to
the
scaffold
,
the
earl
called
out
to
the
people
whose
prayers
and
lamentations
<EOS>
he
could
hear:"Good
friends
<EOS>
,
I
thank
you
heartily
.
<EOS>
The
God
of
Mercy
bless
you
?
<EOS>
Continue
to
pray
for
me
,
I
beseech
you
!
<EOS>
And
may
our
blessed
Lord
return
your
prayers
into
your
own
bosoms!"Before
mounting
the
steps
,
at
the
top
of
which
stood
two
pikemen
,
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
exclaimed
aloud:"Heaven
,
I
thank
thee
that
I
am
not
afraid
to
go
up
here
,
though
there
are
but
these
few
steps
to
my
eternity!"Kissing
the
ladder
<EOS>
,
he
ascended
,
followed
after
a
short
interval
by
Baguley
and
Paul
Moreau
.
<EOS>
The
officer
had
already
gone
upCHAPTER
<EOS>
IIIA
TumultON
gaining
the
platform
,
the
earl
marched
towards
the
rails
,
averting
his
gaze
from
the
headsman
and
the
block
,
and
taking
off
his
hat
bowed
to
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
Though
surprised
to
find
them
so
few
in
number
—
for
he
had
expected
a
large
and
tumultuous
crowd
—
he
was
inexpressibly
touched
by
their
sympathetic
looks
.
<EOS>
On
their
part
the
spectators
were
equally
struck
,
though
in
a
different
manner
,
by
the
earl
's
appearance
,
as
he
stood
bareheaded
before
them
.
<EOS>
To
those
familiar
with
his
noble
countenance
,
it
seemed
wofully
changed
.
<EOS>
Skin
pallid
,
eyes
lacking
lustre
,
dark
locks
streaked
with
grey
.
<EOS>
But
his
demeanour
had
lost
none
of
its
dignity
,
and
the
change
described
gave
a
peculiar
interest
to
his
features
,
as
showing
the
trials
he
had
gone
through
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
his
speech
to
the
assemblage
,
his
countenance
brightened
up
,
and
his
eyes
flashed
fire
as
he
thus
concluded:"By
the
king
's
enemies
I
am
condemned
to
die
,
by
new
and
unknown
laws
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
send
us
our
king
again
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
send
us
our
old
laws
again
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
send
us
our
religion
again
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
religion
now
practised
,
it
has
no
name
.
<EOS>
Truly
can
I
say
for
myself
,
I
die
for
God
,
the
king
,
and
the
laws
;
and
this
makes
me
not
ashamed
of
my
life
,
or
afraid
to
die
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
these
bold
words
were
uttered
,
a
trooper
near
the
scaffold
called
out
in
a
stentorian
voice:"We
will
neither
have
king
,
lords
,
nor
laws
.
<EOS>
"Regarding
<EOS>
the
interruption
as
a
needless
insult
to
the
earl
<EOS>
,
the
bystanders
resented
it
by
a
loud
groan
,
and
hooting
.
<EOS>
Thereupon
,
the
whole
of
the
troopers
,
exasperated
by
the
sympathy
manifested
for
the
earl
,
turned
suddenly
round
,
and
drove
the
people
back
,
cutting
at
them
with
their
swords
,
and
chasing
them
in
different
directions
.
<EOS>
Several
were
wounded
,
and
a
child
was
ridden
over
and
killed
.
<EOS>
This
deplorable
occurrence
caused
the
earl
the
greatest
distress
,
as
he
was
compelled
to
witness
the
painful
spectacle
.
<EOS>
He
vainly
besought
the
officer
to
stay
the
hands
of
the
infuriated
troopers
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
grieves
me
more
than
my
own
death
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
these
poor
inoffensive
people
should
be
hurt
on
my
account
—
perhaps
die
for
me
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
people
are
not
inoffensive
,
and
must
be
taught
a
lesson
,
"
replied
the
officer
,
declining
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
So
the
troopers
continued
riding
backwards
and
forwards
for
some
time
to
the
great
terror
of
the
people
,
and
the
earl
unable
to
help
them
,
sat
down
in
a
chair
,
which
had
been
placed
on
the
scaffold
,
and
covered
his
face
to
exclude
the
sight
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IVThe
BlockWHEN
the
tumult
at
length
subsided
,
and
some
of
the
boldest
of
the
spectators
ventured
to
come
back
,
the
earl
called
to
the
headsman
,
and
bade
him
bring
him
the
axe
.
<EOS>
Rudely
and
reluctantly
,
the
surly
fellow
obeyed
.
<EOS>
"Friend
<EOS>
,
I
will
not
harm
it
,
"
observed
the
earl
,
as
he
took
the
implement
;
"
and
I
am
sure
it
will
not
harm
me
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
I
wo
n't
answer
for
that
,
"
rejoined
the
headsman
,
with
a
horrible
grin
.
<EOS>
"
Maybe
it
will
.
<EOS>
Feel
the
edge
,
and
you
will
find
it
tolerably
sharp
.
<EOS>
""I
would
have
it
sharp
,
"
said
the
earl
.
<EOS>
And
kissing
the
weapon
he
returned
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
"Here
are
two
gold
pieces
—
all
I
have
,
"
he
added
.
<EOS>
"
I
pray
thee
do
thy
work
effectually
.
<EOS>
""I
will
try
,
"
replied
the
churl
,
as
he
put
the
coin
in
his
pouch
.
<EOS>
"Thou
hadst
best
take
off
thy
doublet
,
"
said
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
too
cumbrous
for
thy
work
.
<EOS>
""You
are
mistaken
,
"
replied
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
hinder
me
.
<EOS>
"Several
<EOS>
of
the
lookers
on
<EOS>
,
displeased
by
the
man
's
behaviour
,
here
called
out:"Kneel
,
fellow
,
and
ask
his
lordship
's
pardon
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
the
churl
refused
,
and
called
out
significantly:"It
seems
you
want
another
lesson
from
the
troopers
,
my
masters
.
<EOS>
""As
thou
wilt
,
friend
,
"
said
the
earl
,
desirous
that
peace
should
be
kept
.
<EOS>
"
I
give
the
pardon
thou
wilt
not
ask
.
<EOS>
May
Heaven
forgive
thee
also!"Hearing
a
noise
,
and
fearing
a
fresh
delay
,
he
earnestly
ejaculated:"How
long
,
Lord
,
how
long!"Quiet
being
soon
restored
,
the
earl
arose
from
his
chair
,
and
looking
at
the
coffin
,
said:"Thou
art
my
bridal
chamber
.
<EOS>
In
thee
I
shall
rest
without
a
guard
.
<EOS>
"From
the
coffin
he
turned
to
the
block
,
and
remarked:"Methinks
<EOS>
it
is
very
low
,
and
yet
there
is
but
one
step
from
it
to
Heaven
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
he
caused
it
to
be
shifted
,
so
that
he
might
see
the
church
,
remarking:"While
I
am
here
<EOS>
I
will
look
towards
thy
holy
sanctuary
,
and
I
know
that
within
a
few
minutes
I
shall
behold
thee
,
my
God
and
King
,
in
thy
sanctuary
above
.
<EOS>
Under
the
shadow
of
thy
wings
shall
be
my
refuge
till
this
calamity
be
overpast
.

"CHAPTER

VMartyrdomHE
then
began
to
prepare
for
death
,
and
taking
off
his
blue
riband
gave
it
to
Baguley
to
deliver
to
his
son
,
saying:"He
knows
my
injunctions
respecting
it
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
Paul
Moreau
's
aid
<EOS>
,
he
next
divested
himself
of
his
doublet
and
band
,
and
then
addressing
the
officer
said:"Pray
tell
me
how
I
must
lie
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
called
bloodthirsty
,
yet
I
had
never
the
severe
curiosity
to
see
any
man
put
to
death
in
peace
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
lordship
had
best
make
the
trial
,
"
replied
the
officer
.
<EOS>
The
earl
then
laid
himself
down
upon
the
block
,
and
on
rising
caused
it
to
be
slightly
moved
.
<EOS>
When
this
was
done
,
he
said
to
the
headsman:"Friend
,
remember
what
I
told
thee
.
<EOS>
Be
no
more
afraid
to
strike
than
I
am
to
die
.
<EOS>
When
I
put
up
my
hand
,
do
thy
work
.
<EOS>
"Looking
<EOS>
round
at
his
attendants
,
and
at
the
people
who
were
watching
his
every
action
,
and
listening
intently
for
a
word
,
he
lifted
up
his
hands
,
and
exclaimed:"The
Lord
bless
you
all
.
<EOS>
Once
more
pray
for
me
,
and
with
me
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
knelt
down
beside
the
chair
,
the
injunction
was
universally
obeyed
.
<EOS>
After
praying
fervently
for
some
time
,
he
arose
with
a
smiling
countenance
,
and
said:"My
soul
is
now
at
rest
,
and
so
shall
my
body
be
immediately
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
bless
my
king
and
restore
him
to
his
rights
in
this
kingdom
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
bless
this
kingdom
,
and
restore
the
people
to
their
rights
in
their
king
,
that
he
and
they
may
join
hand
in
hand
to
settle
truth
and
peace
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
bless
this
country
,
this
town
,
this
people
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
comfort
my
wife
and
children
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
forgive
the
authors
of
my
unjust
death
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
laying
his
neck
upon
the
block
,
he
stretched
out
his
arms
,
exclaiming:"Blessed
be
God
's
holy
name
for
ever
and
ever!"With
<EOS>
these
words
he
gave
the
sign
.
<EOS>
But
the
headsman
moved
not
.
<EOS>
After
a
moment
of
dreadful
suspense
,
the
earl
arose
,
and
regarding
the
man
sternly
,
exclaimed:"Why
do
you
keep
me
from
my
Saviour
?
<EOS>
What
have
I
done
that
I
die
not
to
live
with
Him
.
<EOS>
Once
more
I
will
lie
down
in
peace
,
and
take
my
everlasting
rest
.
<EOS>
"Again
<EOS>
extending
himself
on
the
block
,
he
cried
out!"Come
,
Lord
Jesus!—come
quickly!"This
time
the
executioner
did
not
delay
,
but
struck
off
the
noble
head
at
a
single
blow
,
amid
universal
lamentation
.
<EOS>
When
the
body
was
placed
in
the
coffin
,
a
piece
of
paper
was
dropped
upon
the
breast
,
on
which
these
lines
were
traced
:
Bounty
,
wit
,
courage
,
here
in
one
lie
dead
,
a
Stanley

,
