IF
ENGLAND
KNEW
  
No
sane
person
can
deny
that
England
is
in
grave
danger
of
invasion
by
Germany
at
a
date
not
far
distant
.
 
<EOS>
This
very
serious
fact
<EOS>
I
endeavoured
to
place
vividly
before
the
public
in
my
recent
forecast
,
_
<EOS>
The
Invasion
of
1910
<EOS>
_
,
the
publication
of
which
,
in
Germany
and
in
England
,
aroused
a
storm
of
indignation
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
Government
,
it
will
be
remembered
,
endeavoured
to
suppress
its
publication
,
because
it
contained
many
serious
truths
,
which
it
was
deemed
best
should
be
withheld
from
the
public
,
and
on
its
publication
--
in
defiance
of
the
statements
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
<EOS>
the
pressure
brought
upon
me
by
the
Prime
Minister
--
I
was
denounced
as
a
panicmonger
.
 
<EOS>
But
have
not
certain
of
my
warnings
already
been
fulfilled
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
desire
to
create
undue
alarm
.
<EOS>
I
am
an
Englishman
,
and
,
I
hope
,
a
patriot
.
<EOS>
What
I
have
written
in
this
present
volume
in
the
form
of
fiction
is
based
upon
serious
facts
within
my
own
personal
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
That
German
spies
are
actively
at
work
in
Great
Britain
is
well
known
to
the
authorities
.
<EOS>
The
number
of
agents
of
the
German
Secret
Police
at
this
moment
working
in
our
midst
on
behalf
of
the
Intelligence
Department
in
Berlin
are
believed
to
be
over
five
thousand
.
<EOS>
To
each
agent
--
known
as
a
"
fixed
-
post"--is
allotted
the
task
of
discovering
some
secret
,
or
of
noting
in
a
certain
district
every
detail
which
may
be
of
advantage
to
the
invader
when
he
lands
.
<EOS>
This
"
fixed
-
agent
"
is
,
in
turn
,
controlled
by
a
travelling
agent
,
who
visits
him
regularly
,
allots
the
work
,
collects
his
reports
,
and
makes
monthly
payments
,
the
usual
stipend
varying
from
L10
to
L30
per
month
,
according
to
the
social
position
of
the
spy
and
the
work
in
which
he
or
she
may
be
engaged
.
 
<EOS>
The
spies
themselves
are
not
always
German
.
<EOS>
They
are
often
Belgians
,
Swiss
,
or
Frenchmen
employed
in
various
trades
and
professions
,
and
each
being
known
in
the
Bureau
of
Secret
Police
by
a
number
only
,
their
monthly
information
being
docketed
under
that
particular
number
.
<EOS>
Every
six
months
an
"
inspection
"
is
held
,
and
monetary
rewards
made
to
those
whose
success
has
been
most
noteworthy
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
brigade
of
spies
in
England
is
controlled
by
a
well
-
known
member
of
the
German
Secret
Police
in
London
,
from
whom
the
travelling
agents
take
their
orders
,
and
in
turn
transmit
them
to
the
"
fixed
-
posts
,
"
who
are
scattered
up
and
down
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
write
,
I
have
before
me
a
file
of
amazing
documents
,
which
plainly
show
the
feverish
activity
with
which
this
advance
guard
of
our
enemy
is
working
to
secure
for
their
employers
the
most
detailed
information
.
<EOS>
These
documents
have
already
been
placed
before
the
Minister
for
War
,
who
returned
them
without
comment
!
 
<EOS>
He
is
aware
of
the
truth
,
and
can
not
deny
it
in
face
of
these
incriminating
statements
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
often
said
that
the
Germans
do
not
require
to
pursue
any
system
of
espionage
in
England
when
they
can
purchase
our
Ordnance
maps
at
a
shilling
each
.
<EOS>
But
do
these
Ordnance
maps
show
the
number
of
horses
and
carts
in
a
district
,
the
stores
of
food
and
forage
,
the
best
way
in
which
to
destroy
bridges
,
the
lines
of
telegraph
and
telephone
,
and
the
places
with
which
they
communicate
,
and
such
-
like
matters
of
vital
importance
to
the
invader
?
<EOS>
Facts
such
as
these
,
and
many
others
,
are
being
daily
conveyed
by
spies
in
their
carefully
prepared
reports
to
Berlin
,
as
well
as
the
secrets
of
every
detail
of
our
armament
,
our
defences
,
and
our
newest
inventions
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
last
twelve
months
,
aided
by
a
well
-
known
detective
officer
,
I
have
made
personal
inquiry
into
the
presence
and
work
of
these
spies
,
an
inquiry
which
has
entailed
a
great
amount
of
travelling
,
much
watchfulness
,
and
often
considerable
discomfort
,
for
I
have
felt
that
,
in
the
circumstances
,
some
system
of
contra
-
espionage
should
be
established
,
as
has
been
done
in
France
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
refrained
from
giving
actual
names
and
dates
,
for
obvious
reasons
,
and
have
therefore
been
compelled
,
even
at
risk
of
being
again
denounced
as
a
scaremonger
,
to
present
the
facts
in
the
form
of
fiction
--
fiction
which
,
I
trust
,
will
point
its
own
patriotic
moral
.
 
<EOS>
Colonel
Mark
Lockwood
,
Member
for
Epping
,
sounded
a
very
serious
warning
note
in
the
middle
of
1908
when
he
asked
questions
of
the
Minister
for
War
,
and
afterwards
of
the
Prime
Minister
,
respecting
the
presence
of
German
spies
in
Norfolk
,
Suffolk
,
Essex
,
and
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
He
pointed
out
that
for
the
past
two
years
these
individuals
,
working
upon
a
carefully
prepared
plan
,
had
been
sketching
,
photographing
,
and
carefully
making
notes
throughout
the
whole
of
East
Anglia
.
 
<EOS>
With
truth
,
he
declared
that
this
organised
system
of
espionage
was
for
one
reason
alone
,
namely
in
preparation
for
a
sudden
raid
upon
our
shores
,
for
"
the
Day"--as
<EOS>
it
is
known
in
Germany
--
the
Day
of
the
Invasion
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
The
replies
given
by
His
Majesty
's
Ministers
were
colourless
,
though
they
both
actually
confessed
themselves
unable
to
deal
with
the
situation
!
<EOS>
Under
our
existing
law
it
seems
that
a
foreign
spy
is
free
to
go
hither
and
thither
,
and
plot
the
downfall
of
England
,
while
we
,
ostrich
-
like
,
bury
our
head
in
the
sand
at
the
sign
of
approaching
danger
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
has
passed
when
one
Englishman
was
worth
ten
foreigners
.
<EOS>
Modern
science
in
warfare
has
altered
all
that
.
<EOS>
All
the
rifle
-
clubs
in
England
could
not
stop
one
German
battalion
,
because
the
German
battalion
is
trained
and
disciplined
in
the
art
of
war
,
while
our
rifle
-
clubs
are
neither
disciplined
nor
trained
.
<EOS>
Were
every
able
-
bodied
man
in
the
kingdom
to
join
a
rifle
-
club
<EOS>
we
should
be
no
nearer
the
problem
of
beating
the
German
invaders
if
once
they
landed
,
than
if
the
spectators
in
all
the
football
matches
held
in
Britain
mobilised
against
a
foreign
foe
.
<EOS>
The
Territorial
idea
is
a
delusion
.
<EOS>
Seaside
camps
for
a
fortnight
a
year
are
picnics
,
not
soldiering
.
<EOS>
The
art
of
navigation
,
the
science
of
engineering
,
or
the
trade
of
carpentering
can
not
be
learned
in
fourteen
days
annually
--
neither
can
the
art
of
war
.
 
<EOS>
In
response
,
we
have
held
up
to
us
the
strength
of
our
Navy
.
<EOS>
But
is
it
really
what
it
is
represented
by
our
rulers
to
an
already
deluded
public
?
 
<EOS>
Only
as
recently
as
March
29
,
1909
,
Sir
Edward
Grey
,
replying
to
Mr.
Balfour
's
vote
of
censure
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
was
compelled
to
admit
that--
      
"
A
new
situation
is
created
by
the
German
programme
.
<EOS>
When
it
is
     
completed
,
Germany
,
a
great
country
close
to
our
own
shores
,
     
will
have
a
fleet
of
thirty
-
three
Dreadnoughts
,
and
that
fleet
     
will
be
the
most
powerful
which
the
world
has
ever
yet
seen
.
<EOS>
It
     
imposes
upon
us
the
necessity
of
rebuilding
the
whole
of
our
     
fleet
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
situation
.
"
 
<EOS>
Germany
is
our
friend
--
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
But
Prince
Buelow
now
admits
that
the
Kaiser

telegram
to
President
Kruger
was
no

whim

of

<EOS>
HOW
THE
PLANS
OF
ROSYTH
WERE
STOLEN
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
the
new
plans
for
our
naval
base
at
Rosyth
have
already
been
secured
by
Germany
,
I
do
n't
see
what
we
can
do
,
"
I
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
use
of
closing
the
stable
-
door
after
the
horse
has
been
stolen
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
just
what
we
generally
do
in
England
,
my
dear
old
Jack
,
"
replied
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
We
still
think
,
as
in
the
days
of
Wellington
,
that
one
Englishman
is
worth
ten
foreigners
.
<EOS>
But
remember
the
Boer
War
,
and
what
our
shameful
ignorance
cost
us
in
men
and
money
.
<EOS>
Now
,
as
I
explained
last
night
in
London
,
the
original
plans
of
Rosyth
leaked
out
some
time
ago
,
and
were
actually
published
in
certain
Continental
papers
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
,
fresh
plans
have
been
prepared
and
adopted
by
the
Lords
of
the
Admiralty
.
<EOS>
It
is
one
of
these
which
Reitmeyer
informs
my
father
is
already
in
German
hands
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
is
not
Reitmeyer
a
German
himself
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
naturalised
Englishman
,
"
replied
my
friend
Ray
Raymond
,
drawing
hard
at
his
pipe
as
he
stretched
himself
lazily
before
the
fire
of
the
inn
-
parlour
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
he
who
gave
the
guv'nor
a
good
deal
of
the
information
upon
which
he
based
those
questions
he
asked
in
the
House
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
Government
refused
to
admit
that
German
spies
are
at
work
in
England
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Jack

<EOS>
That
's
just
why
I
'm
down
here
on
the
Firth
of
Forth
--
in
order
to
accomplish
the
task
I
've
set
myself
,
<EOS>
namely
,
to
prove
that
German
secret
agents
are
at
this
moment
actively
at
work
amongst
us
.
<EOS>
I
intend
to
furnish
proof
of
the
guv'nor
's
statements
,
and
by
exposing
the
methods
of
these
inquisitive
gentry
,
compel
the
Government
to
introduce
fresh
legislation
in
order
that
the
authorities
may
be
able
to
deal
with
them
.
<EOS>
At
present
spies
may
work
their
will
in
England
,
and
the
law
is
powerless
to
prevent
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
was
standing
with
my
back
to
the
fire
facing
my
friend
,
who
,
a
barrister
like
myself
,
shared
with
me
a
set
of
rather
dismal
chambers
in
New
Stone
Buildings
,
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
though
he
had
never
had
occasion
to
practise
,
as
I
unfortunately
had
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
sat
,
his
long
,
thin
legs
outstretched
towards
the
fire
,
he
presented
the
appearance
of
the
typical
athletic
young
Englishman
,
aged
about
thirty
,
clean
-
shaven
,
clean
-
limbed
,
with
an
intelligent
and
slightly
aquiline
face
,
a
pair
of
merry
grey
eyes
,
and
light
brown
hair
closely
cropped
.

was

all

had
been
cast
in

we
had

though
he
now
shared
those
dingy

he
resided

lived

had
been

him
great
things

But
the
long

wished

still
afar

commendable

had
been
the
recipient
of
many
letters
pointing
out
the
presence
of
spies
--
letters
which
,
if
published
,
would
have
no
doubt
created
a
great
sensation
.
<EOS>
Many
of
these
statements
<EOS>
Ray
and
I
had
,
during
the
past
two
months
,
closely
investigated
on
the
spot
,
and
what
we
had
discovered
held
us
both
amazed
and
alarmed
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
we
had
secured
evidence
that
although
spies
were
openly
at
work
in
certain
of
our
eastern
counties
collecting
all
sorts
of
information
which
would
be
of
incalculable
importance
to
an
invader
,
yet
the
chief
constables
of
those
counties
had
actually
been
instructed
from
head
-
quarters
to
close
their
eyes
to
the
movements
of
inquisitive
foreigners
!
 
<EOS>
In
the
investigations
upon
which
Ray
Raymond
had
embarked
with
such
enthusiasm
,
and
which
I
am
now
permitted
to
chronicle
in
these
pages
,
he
had
taken
only
two
persons
into
his
confidence
--
myself
and
Vera
,
the
pretty
,
fair
-
haired
daughter
of
Vice
-
Admiral
Sir
Charles
Vallance
,
the
Admiral
-
Superintendent
of
Portsmouth
Dockyard
,
to
whom
he
was
engaged
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
from
the
first
I
suspected
that
it
had
been
her
influence
that
had
roused
him
to
action
;
she
who
had
promised
him
her
assistance
,
and
who
had
pointed
out
how
,
by
watching
and
unmasking
the
spies
,
he
might
render
his
King
and
country
signal
service
.
 
<EOS>
At
dusk
that
day
we
had
,
on
arrival
from
King
's
Cross
,
left
our
baggage
with
the
hall
porter
of
the
North
British
Hotel
in
Edinburgh
,
had
travelled
from
the
Waverley
Station
to
Dalmeny
,
and
descending
the
hundred
or
so
steps
to
the
comfortable
Hawes
Inn
,
at
the
water
's
edge
,
had
dined
there
.
<EOS>
Thence
we
had
taken
the
old
ferry
-
boat
over
to
North
Queensferry
,
on
the
opposite
shore
,
where
,
in
the
rather
bare
parlour
of
the
little
Albert
Hotel
,
directly
beneath
the
giant
arms
of
the
Forth
Bridge
,
we
were
resting
and
smoking
.
 
<EOS>
Outside
the
November
night
was
dark
and
squally
with
drizzling
rain
;
within
the
warmth
was
cheerful
,
the
fire
throwing
a
red
glow
upon
the
old
-
fashioned
mahogany
sideboard
with
its
profuse
display
of
china
and
the
two
long
tables
covered
with
red
cloths
.

<EOS>
From
my
boyhood
days
,
I
,
John
James
Jacox
,
barrister
-
at
-
law
,
had
always
been
fond
of
detective
work
;
therefore
I
realised
that
in
the
present
inquiry
before
us
there
was
wide
scope
for
one
's
reasoning
powers
,
as
well
as
a
great
probability
of
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
thoroughly
wiping
my
gold
pince
-
nez
,
utterly
failing
to
discover
Ray
's
reason
in
travelling
to
that
spot
now
that
it
was
admitted
that
the
Germans
had
already
outwitted
us
and
secured
a
copy
of
at
least
one
of
the
plans
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
glancing
up
at
the
cheap
American
clock
on
the
mantelshelf
,
my
friend
declared
that
we
ought
to
be
moving
and
at
once
struggled
into
his
coat
and
crushed
on
his
soft
felt
hat
.
<EOS>
It
then
wanted
a
quarter
to
ten
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
In
ascending
the
short
,
steep
hill
in
the
semi
-
darkness
,
we
passed
the
North
Queensferry
post
office
,
beside
which
he
stopped
short
to
peer
down
the
dark
alley
which
separated
it
from
the
Roxburgh
Hotel
.
<EOS>
I
noticed
that
in
this
alley
stood
a
short
,
stout
telegraph
-
pole
,
carrying
about
sixty
or
so
lines
of
wire
which
,
coming
overhead
from
the
north
,
converged
at
that
point
into
a
cable
,
and
crossed
to
the
south
beneath
the
mile
-
broad
waters
of
the
Forth
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
was
apparently
interested
in
them
,
for
glancing
overhead
he
saw
another
set
of
wires
which
,
carried
higher
,
crossed
the
street
and
ran
away
to
the
left
.
<EOS>
This
road
he
followed
,
I
walking
at
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
The
way
we
took
proved
to
be
a
winding
one
,
which
,
instead
of
ascending
the
steep
hill
with
its
many
quarries
,
from
the
summit
of
which
the
wonderful
bridge
runs
forth
,
skirted
the
estuary
westward
past
a
number
of
small
grey
cottages
,
the
gardens
of
some
of
which
appeared
to
run
down
to
the
broad
waters
<EOS>
whence
shone
the
flashing
light
of
the
Beamer
and
those
of
Dalmeny
,
the
Bridge
,
and
of
South
Queensferry
.
 
<EOS>
The
rain
had
ceased
,
and
the
moon
,
slowly
struggling
from
behind
a
big
bank
of
cloud
,
now
produced
a
most
picturesque
effect
of
light
and
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
The
actions
of
Ray
Raymond
were
,
however
,
somewhat
mysterious
,
for
on
passing
each
telegraph
-
pole
he
,
by
the
aid
of
a
small
electric
torch
he
carried
in
his
pocket
,
examined
it
carefully
at
a
distance
of
about
six
feet
from
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
have
thus
minutely
examined
at
least
fifteen
or
sixteen
when
,
at
the
sharp
bend
of
the
road
,
he
apparently
discovered
something
of
which
he
was
in
search
.
<EOS>
The
pole
stood
close
beside
the
narrow
pathway
,
and
as
he
examined
it
with
his
magnifying
-
glass
<EOS>
I
also
became
curious
.
<EOS>
But
all
I
distinguished
were
three
small
gimlet
holes
set
in
a
triangle
in
the
black
tarred
wood
about
four
inches
apart
.
 
<EOS>
"
Count
the
wires
,
Jack
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
make
them
twenty
-
six
.
<EOS>
Am
I
correct
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
counted
,
and
found
the
number
to
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
Then
for
some
moments
he
stood
in
thoughtful
silence
,
gazing
away
over
the
wide
view
of
St.
Margaret
's
Hope
spread
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
Afterwards
we
moved
forward
.
<EOS>
Passing
along
,
he
examined
each
of
the
other
poles
,
until
we
descended
the
hill
to
the
Ferry
Toll
,
where
the
high
road
and
wires
branched
off
to
the
right
to
Dunfermline
.
<EOS>
Then
,
taking
the
left
-
hand
road
along
the
shore
,
where
ran
a
line
of
telephone
,
we
passed
some
wharves
,
gained
the
Limpet
Ness
,
and
for
a
further
couple
of
miles
skirted
the
moonlit
waters
,
until
,
of
a
sudden
<EOS>
,
there
came
into
view
a
long
corrugated
-
iron
building
lying
back
from
the
road
facing
the
Forth
and
fenced
off
by
a
high
spiked
-
iron
railing
.
<EOS>
The
entrance
was
in
the
centre
,
with
nine
long
windows
on
either
side
,
while
at
a
little
distance
further
back
lay
a
small
bungalow
,
evidently
the
residence
of
the
caretaker
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
exclaimed
my
friend
without
halting
,
"
is
the
much
-
discussed
Rosyth
.
<EOS>
These
are
the
Admiralty
offices
,
and
from
here
the
tracing
of
that
plan
was
obtained
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
rather
lonely
spot
,
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Over
yonder
,
beyond
that
ruined
castle
out
on
the
rocks
,
where
Oliver
Cromwell
's
mother
was
born
,
is
the
site
of
the
new
naval
base
.
<EOS>
You
'll
get
a
better
view
from
the
other
side
of
the
hill
,
"
he
said
in
a
low
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
lives
in
the
bungalow
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
the
caretaker
.
<EOS>
The
nearest
house
is
on
top
of
the
hill
,
and
is
occupied
by
the
second
officer
in
charge
of
the
works
.
"
 
<EOS>
Continuing
our
way
and
passing
over
the
hill
,
we
skirted
a
wood
,
which
I
afterwards
found
to
be
Orchardhead
Wood
,
passed
a
pair
of
lonely
cottages
on
the
right
,
until
we
reached
a
lane
running
down
to
the
water
's
edge
.
<EOS>
Turning
into
this
lane
,
we
walked
as
far
as
a
gate
which
commanded
the
great
stretch
of
broad
,
level
meadows
and
the
wide
bay
beyond
.
<EOS>
Leaning
over
it
,
he
said
:
 
"
This
is
where
the
new
naval
base
is
to
be
.
<EOS>
Yonder
,
where
you
see
the
lights
,
is
Bruce
Haven
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
the
facts
regarding
the
stolen
plan
as
far
as
is
known
,
"
I
said
,
leaning
on
the
gate
also
and
gazing
away
across
the
wide
stretch
of
moonlit
waters
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
facts
are
curious
,
"
replied
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
As
you
know
,
I
've
been
away
from
London
a
fortnight
,
and
in
those
fourteen
days
I
've
not
been
idle
.
<EOS>
It
seems
that
when
the
first
plan
leaked
out
and
was
published
abroad
,
the
Admiralty
had
two
others
prepared
,
and
into
both
these
a
commission
which
came
down
here
has
,
for
several
months
,
been
busily
at
work
investigating
their
feasibility
.
<EOS>
At
last
one
of
the
schemes
has
been
adopted
.
<EOS>
Tracings
of
it
are
kept
in
strictest
secrecy
in
a
safe
in
the
offices
down
yonder
,
together
with
larger
-
scale
tracings
of
the
various
docks
,
the
submarine
station
,
repairing
docks
,
patent
slips
,
and
defensive
forts
--
some
twenty
-
two
documents
in
all
.
<EOS>
The
details
of
the
defensive
forts
are
,
of
course
,
kept
a
profound
secret
.
<EOS>
The
safe
has
two
keys
,
one
kept
by
the
superintendent
of
the
works
,
Mr.
Wilkinson
,
who
lives
over
at
Dunfermline
,
and
the
other
by
the
first
officer
,
Mr.
Farrar
,
who
resides
in
a
house
half
a
mile
from
the
offices
.
<EOS>
The
safe
can
not
be
opened
except
by
the
two
gentlemen
being
present
together
.
<EOS>
The
leakage
could
not
come
from
within
.
<EOS>
None
of
the
plans
have
ever
been
found
to
be
missing
and
no
suspicion
attaches
to
anybody
,
yet
there
are
two
most
curious
facts
.
<EOS>
The
first
is
that
in
July
last
a
young
clerk
named
Edwin
Jephson
,
living
with
his
mother
in
Netley
Road
,
Shepherd
's
Bush
,
and
employed
by
a
firm
of
auctioneers
in
the
City
,
was
picked
up
in
the
Thames
off
Thorneycroft
's
at
Chiswick
.
<EOS>
At
the
inquest
,
the
girl
to
whom
the
young
man
was
engaged
testified
to
his
strangeness
of
manner
a
few
days
previously
;
while
his
mother
stated
how
,
prior
to
his
disappearance
,
he
had
been
absent
from
home
for
four
days
,
and
on
his
return
had
seemed
greatly
perturbed
,
and
had
remarked
:
'
There
'll
be
something
in
the
papers
about
me
before
long
.
'
<EOS>
On
the
body
were
found
fourteen
shillings
in
silver
,
some
coppers
,
a
few
letters
,
and
a
folio
of
blue
foolscap
containing
some
writing
in
German
which
,
on
translation
,
proved
to
be
certain
details
regarding
a
fortress
.
<EOS>
A
verdict
of
suicide
was
returned
;
but
the
statement
in
German
,
placed
by
the
police
before
the
Admiralty
,
proved
to
be
an
exact
copy
of
one
of
the
documents
preserved
in
the
safe
here
,
at
Rosyth
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
the
Admiralty
can
not
deny
the
leakage
of
the
secret
?
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
but
the
mystery
remains
how
it
came
into
the
young
fellow
's
possession
,
and
what
he
was
about
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
can
be
ascertained
,
he
was
a
most
exemplary
young
man
,
and
had
no
connection
whatever
with
any
one
in
Admiralty
employ
,
"
replied
Ray
;
adding
,
"
the
second
fact
is
the
one
alleged
by
Reitmeyer
,
who
was
,
in
confidence
,
shown
a
photograph
of
one
of
the
larger
plans
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
spies
are
,
no
doubt
,
at
work
here
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
can
not
be
denied
,
"
was
his
reply
.
<EOS>
"
This
neighbourhood
opens
up
a
wide
field
of
investigation
to
the
inquisitive
gentry
from
the
Fatherland
.
<EOS>
Knowledge
of
the
secrets
of
the
defences
of
the
Firth
of
Forth
would
be
of
the
utmost
advantage
to
Germany
in
the
event
of
an
invasion
.
<EOS>
The
local
submarine
defences
and
corps
of
submarine
miners
have
been
done
away
with
,
yet
the
entrance
of
the
estuary
is
commanded
by
strong
batteries
upon
the
island
of
Inchkeith
,
opposite
Leith
;
the
Forth
Bridge
is
defended
by
masked
batteries
at
Dalmeny
at
the
one
end
and
at
Carlingnose
at
the
other
,
while
upon
Inchgarvie
,
the
rock
beneath
the
centre
of
the
bridge
,
is
a
powerful
battery
of
six
-
inch
guns
.
<EOS>
The
true
strength
of
these
defences
,
and
the
existence
of
others
,
are
,
of
course
,
kept
an
absolute
secret
,
but
Germany
is
equally
anxious
to
learn
them
,
as
she
is
to
know
exactly
what
our
plans
are
regarding
this
new
naval
base
and
its
fortifications
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
if
the
new
base
were
established
,
might
not
the
Forth
Bridge
be
blown
into
the
water
by
the
enemy
,
and
our
fleet
bottled
up
by
the
wreckage
?
<EOS>
"
I
ventured
to
remark
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
just
the
point
,
Jack
,
"
my
friend
said
;
"
whether
the
Rosyth
works
are
carried
out
or
not
,
the
Germans
would
,
without
doubt
,
use
their
best
endeavours
to
blow
up
the
bridge
;
first
in
order
to
cut
direct
communication
between
north
and
south
,
and
secondly
,
to
prevent
British
ships
using
St.
Margaret
's
Hope
as
a
haven
of
refuge
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
even
in
face
of
the
document
discovered
upon
the
auctioneer
's
clerk
,
the
Government
deny
the
activity
of
spies
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Ray
in
a
hard
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
week
ago
I
was
up
here
,
and
examined
the
safe
in
the
offices
we
've
passed
.
<EOS>
I
was
only
laughed
at
for
my
pains
.
<EOS>
I
must
admit
,
of
course
,
that
no
document
has
ever
been
missing
,
and
that
the
safe
has
not
been
tampered
with
in
any
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
complete
mystery
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
One
which
,
my
dear
Jack
,
we
must
solve
,
"
he
said
,
as
we
retraced
our
steps
back
to
North
Queensferry
station
,
where
we
luckily
caught
a
train
back
to
Edinburgh
.
 
<EOS>
Next
morning
we
travelled
again
to
Dalmeny
,
and
in
the
grey
mist
hired
a
boat
at
the
slippery
landing
-
stage
opposite
the
Hawes
Inn
.
<EOS>
Refusing
the
assistance
of
the
boatman
,
Ray
took
off
his
coat
and
commenced
to
row
to
the
opposite
shore
.
<EOS>
His
action
surprised
me
,
as
we
could
easily
have
gone
over
by
the
steam
ferry
.
<EOS>
It
was
high
tide
,
and
by
degrees
as
we
got
into
mid
-
stream
he
allowed
the
boat
to
drift
towards
one
of
the
sets
of
four
circular
caissons
in
which
the
foundations
of
the
gigantic
bridge
,
with
its
bewildering
masses
of
ironwork
,
were
set
.
 
<EOS>
Against
one
of
them
the
boat
drifted
,
and
he
placed
his
hand
upon
the
masonry
to
prevent
a
collision
.
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
,
his
keen
eyes
discerned
something
which
caused
him
to
pull
back
and
examine
it
more
closely
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
,
a
train
rumbled
high
above
us
.
 
<EOS>
With
curiosity
I
followed
the
direction
of
his
gaze
,
but
what
I
saw
conveyed
to
me
nothing
.
<EOS>
About
two
feet
above
high
-
water
mark
<EOS>
a
stout
iron
staple
had
been
fixed
into
the
concrete
.
<EOS>
To
it
was
attached
a
piece
of
thin
wire
rope
descending
into
the
water
,
apparently
used
by
the
bridge
workmen
to
moor
their
boats
.
 
<EOS>
Having
carefully
examined
the
staple
,
Ray
rowed
round
to
the
other
three
caissons
,
a
few
feet
distant
,
but
there
discovered
nothing
.
<EOS>
Afterwards
,
with
my
assistance
,
he
pulled
back
to
the
Dalmeny
side
,
where
,
at
the
base
of
one
of
the
high
square
brick
piers
of
the
shore
end
of
the
bridge
,
the
third
from
the
land
,
he
found
a
similar
staple
driven
.
<EOS>
Then
we
returned
to
the
pier
and
crossed
to
North
Queensferry
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
's
next
move
was
to
enter
the
post
office
and
there
write
upon
a
yellow
form
<EOS>
a
telegram
in
German
addressed
to
a
person
in
Berlin
.
<EOS>
This
he
handed
to
the
pleasant
-
faced
Scotch
postmistress
,
who
,
on
seeing
it
in
a
strange
language
,
regarded
him
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
remarked
that
he
supposed
she
did
not
often
transmit
messages
in
German
,
whereupon
she
said
:
 
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
The
German
waiter
up
at
the
Golf
Club
sends
them
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
he
the
only
German
you
have
in
North
Queensferry
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
casually
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
never
heard
of
any
other
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
good
woman
,
and
then
we
both
wished
her
good
-
day
and
left
.
 
<EOS>
Our
next
action
was
to
climb
the
Ferry
Hill
at
the
back
of
the
post
office
,
passing
the
station
and
Carlingnose
Fort
,
until
we
reached
the
club
-
house
of
the
Dunfermline
Golf
Club
,
which
commands
a
fine
prospect
over
the
wide
estuary
eastward
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
appeared
to
be
playing
that
morning
,
but
on
entering
the
club
we
were
approached
by
a
fair
-
headed
,
rather
smart
-
looking
German
waiter
.
<EOS>
His
age
was
about
thirty
,
his
fair
moustache
well
trained
,
and
his
hair
closely
cropped
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
inquiry
for
an
imaginary
person
,
and
by
that
means
was
enabled
to
engage
the
man
in
conversation
.
<EOS>
Ray
,
on
his
part
,
remarked
that
he
would
be
staying
in
the
neighbourhood
for
some
time
,
and
requested
a
list
of
members
and
terms
of
membership
.
<EOS>
In
response
,
the
waiter
fetched
him
a
book
of
rules
,
which
he
placed
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
as
we
descended
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
me
,
"
my
friend
remarked
,
"
there
is
only
one
suspicious
fact
about
that
man
--
his
nationality
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
afternoon
we
spent
out
at
the
naval
offices
,
where
I
was
introduced
to
the
Superintendent
and
the
second
officer
,
and
where
I
stood
by
while
my
friend
again
examined
the
big
green
-
painted
safe
,
closely
investigating
its
lock
with
the
aid
of
his
magnifying
glass
.
<EOS>
It
was
apparent
that
those
in
charge
regarded
him
as
a
harmless
crank
,
for
so
confident
<EOS>
were
they
that
no
spy
had
been
able
to
get
at
the
plans
that
no
night
watch
had
ever
been
kept
upon
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
Through
five
consecutive
nights
,
unknown
to
the
caretaker
,
who
slept
so
peacefully
in
his
bungalow
,
we
,
however
,
kept
a
vigilant
watch
upon
the
place
.
<EOS>
But
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Whatever
information
our
friends
the
Germans
wanted
they
seemed
to
have
already
obtained
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
Raymond
,
however
,
continued
to
display
that
quiet
,
methodical
patience
born
of
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
confident
that
something
is
afoot
,
and
that
there
are
spies
in
the
neighbourhood
,
"
he
would
say
.
 
<EOS>
Nearly
a
fortnight
we
spent
,
sometimes
in
Edinburgh
,
and
at
others
idling
about
North
Queensferry
in
the
guise
of
English
tourists
,
for
the
Forth
Bridge
is
still
an
attraction
to
the
sightseer
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
the
German
waiter
at
the
Golf
Club
Ray
was
keeping
a
watchful
eye
.
<EOS>
He
had
discovered
his
name
to
be
Heinrich
Klauber
,
and
that
before
his
engagement
there
he
had
been
a
waiter
in
the
basement
cafe
of
the
Hotel
de
l'Europe
,
in
Leicester
Square
,
London
.
 
<EOS>
His
movements
were
in
no
way
suspicious
.
<EOS>
He
lived
at
a
small
cottage
nearly
opposite
the
post
office
at
North
Queensferry
with
a
widow
named
Macdonald
,
and
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
rather
pretty
dark
-
eyed
girl
named
Elsie
Robinson
,
who
lived
with
her
father
in
the
grey
High
Street
of
Inverkeithing
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
my
observations
went
--
and
it
often
fell
to
my
lot
to
watch
his
movements
while
Ray
was
absent
--
the
German
was
hardworking
,
thrifty
,
and
a
pattern
of
all
the
virtues
.
 
<EOS>
One
evening
,
however
,
a
curious
incident
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
had
run
up
to
London
,
leaving
me
to
watch
the
German
's
movements
.
<EOS>
Klauber
had
returned
to
Mrs.
Macdonald
's
about
eight
,
but
not
until
nearly
eleven
did
he
come
forth
again
,
and
then
instead
of
taking
his
usual
road
to
Inverkeithing
to
meet
the
girl
Robinson
,
he
ascended
the
hill
and
struck
across
the
golf
-
course
until
he
had
gained
its
highest
point
,
which
overlooked
the
waters
of
the
Forth
towards
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
So
suddenly
did
he
halt
that
I
was
compelled
to
throw
myself
into
a
bunker
some
distance
away
to
escape
detection
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
I
watched
,
I
saw
him
take
from
his
pocket
and
light
a
small
acetylene
lamp
,
<EOS>
apparently
a
bicycle
-
lamp
,
with
a
green
glass
.
<EOS>
He
then
placed
it
in
such
a
position
on
the
grass
that
it
could
be
seen
from
far
across
the
waters
,
and
lighting
a
cigarette
,
he
waited
.
 
<EOS>
The
light
on
the
Oxcars
was
flashing
white
and
red
,
while
from
distant
Inchkeith
streamed
a
white
brilliance
at
regular
intervals
.
<EOS>
But
the
light
of
Heinrich
Klauber
was
certainly
a
signal
.
<EOS>
To
whom
?
 
<EOS>
He
remained
there
about
half
an
hour
,
but
whether
he
received
any
answering
signal
I
know
not
.
 
<EOS>
Next
night
and
the
next
I
went
to
the
same
spot
,
but
he
failed
to
put
in
an
appearance
.
<EOS>
Then
,
in
order
to
report
to
Ray
,
I
joined
the
morning
train
from
Perth
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
On
arrival
at
New
Stone
Buildings
I
telephoned
to
Bruton
Street
,
but
Chapman
,
his
valet
,
told
me
that
his
master
had
slept
there
only
one
night
,
had
received
a
visit
from
a
respectably
dressed
middle
-
aged
woman
,
and
had
gone
away
--
to
an
unknown
destination
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
waited
for
a
whole
week
in
anxiety
and
suspense
,
until
one
morning
I
received
a
wire
from
him
,
despatched
from
Kirkcaldy
,
urging
me
to
join
him
at
once
at
the
Station
Hotel
in
Perth
.
 
<EOS>
Next
morning
at
nine
o'clock
I
was
seated
on
the
side
of
his
bed
,
telling
him
of
the
incident
of
the
lamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
after
a
pause
.
<EOS>
"
My
surmises
are
slowly
proving
correct
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
You
must
buy
a
bicycle
-
lamp
down
in
the
town
and
a
piece
of
green
glass
.
<EOS>
To
-
night
you
must
go
there
at
the
same
hour
and
show
a
similar
light
.
<EOS>
The
matter
seems
far
more
serious
than
I
first
expected
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
is
no
doubt
here
,
in
our
midst
.
<EOS>
Take
this
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
handy
before
long
,
"
and
he
took
from
his
kit
-
bag
a
new
.32
Colt
revolver
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
,
I
saw
that
he
had
resolved
upon
some
bold
stroke
.
 
<EOS>
That
evening
,
after
an
early
dinner
at
the
hotel
,
we
took
train
to
North
Queensferry
,
and
on
alighting
at
the
station
he
sent
me
up
to
the
golf
-
links
to
show
a
light
for
half
an
hour
;
promising
to
meet
me
later
at
a
certain
point
on
the
road
to
Rosyth
.
 
<EOS>
I
gained
the
lonely
spot
on
the
golf
-
course
and
duly
showed
the
light
.
<EOS>
Then
I
hastened
to
rejoin
my
friend
at
the
point
he
indicated
,
and
found
him
awaiting
me
behind
some
bushes
.
 
<EOS>
Almost
at
the
moment
we
met
,
a
female
figure
came
along
beneath
the
shadow
of
a
high
wall
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
poorly
dressed
girl
,
but
the
instant
she
addressed
my
friend
<EOS>
I
recognised
by
her
refined
voice
that
it
was
Vera
,
the
dainty
daughter
of
the
Admiral
Superintendent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Elsie
is
waiting
down
by
the
Ferry
Barns
,
"
she
said
quickly
,
in
a
low
whisper
,
after
greeting
me
.
"
<EOS>
Heinrich
has
not
kept
his
appointment
with
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
the
note
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Recollect
what
I
told
you
concerning
the
man
Hartmann
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
Then
,
addressing
me
,
she
said
,
"
Take
care
of
these
people
Mr.
Jacox
.
<EOS>
They
are
utterly
unscrupulous
"
;
and
she
again
disappeared
into
the
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
and
I
turned
and
again
walked
back
in
the
direction
of
Rosyth
.
<EOS>
But
when
we
had
gone
a
little
distance
he
told
me
to
approach
the
naval
offices
carefully
,
conceal
myself
in
the
bushes
,
and
watch
until
he
joined
me
.
<EOS>
On
no
account
was
I
to
make
any
sign
,
whatever
I
might
witness
.
 
<EOS>
Though
intensely
cold
the
night
was
not
very
dark
,
therefore
I
was
not
long
in
establishing
my
position
at
a
spot
where
I
had
a
good
view
of
the
offices
.
<EOS>
Then
I
leaned
upon
a
tree
-
trunk
and
waited
in
breathless
expectation
.
<EOS>
I
touched
my
father
's
old
repeater
which
I
carried
and
found
it
to
be
a
quarter
past
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
For
over
an
hour
I
remained
there
,
scarce
daring
to
move
a
muscle
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
however
,
upon
the
mud
at
the
side
of
the
road
I
heard
soft
footsteps
,
and
a
few
moments
later
two
figures
loomed
up
from
the
shadow
.
<EOS>
But
when
about
forty
yards
from
the
offices
they
halted
,
one
of
the
men
alone
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
With
great
caution
he
climbed
the
spiked
railing
,
and
crossing
rapidly
to
the
main
door
of
the
offices
he
unlocked
it
with
a
key
and
entered
,
closing
the
door
after
him
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
could
distinguish
,
the
man
wore
a
short
beard
,
and
was
dressed
in
tweeds
and
a
golf
cap
.
<EOS>
Holding
my
breath
,
I
saw
the
flashing
of
an
electric
torch
within
the
building
.
 
<EOS>
Fully
twenty
minutes
elapsed
before
he
reappeared
,
relocked
the
outside
door
,
and
clambering
back
over
the
railings
,
rejoined
his
waiting
companion
,
both
being
lost
next
second
in
the
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
I
longed
to
follow
them
,
but
Ray
's
instructions
had
been
explicit
--
I
was
to
wait
until
he
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
later
,
hearing
his
low
whistle
<EOS>
,
I
emerged
from
my
hiding
-
place
to
meet
him
and
tell
him
what
I
had
seen
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
know
.
<EOS>
We
have
now
no
time
to
lose
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
together
we
hurried
back
over
the
road
towards
North
Queensferry
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
spot
where
Vera
had
met
us
,
we
found
her
still
in
hiding
.
<EOS>
My
friend
whispered
some
words
<EOS>
,
whereupon
she
hurried
on
before
us
to
the
sharp
bend
in
the
road
where
stood
the
telegraph
-
pole
which
had
attracted
Ray
on
the
night
of
our
first
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
We
drew
back
in
the
shadow
,
and
as
we
did
so
<EOS>
I
saw
her
halt
and
pull
the
bell
beside
a
small
gate
in
a
high
wall
.
<EOS>
Behind
stood
a
white
-
washed
cottage
,
with
a
good
-
sized
garden
at
the
rear
.
<EOS>
One
end
of
the
house
abutted
upon
the
pathway
,
and
in
it
was
one
small
window
commanding
a
view
of
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
Vera
,
we
saw
,
had
some
conversation
with
the
old
woman
who
answered
her
ring
,
and
then
went
in
,
the
gate
being
closed
after
her
.
 
<EOS>
Together
we
waited
for
a
considerable
time
,
our
impatience
and
apprehension
increasing
.
<EOS>
All
was
silent
,
except
for
a
dog
-
cart
,
in
which
we
recognised
Mr.
Wilkinson
driving
home
from
the
station
.
 
<EOS>
"
Curious
that
Vera
does
n't
return
,
"
Ray
remarked
at
last
,
when
we
had
waited
nearly
three
-
quarters
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
investigate
for
ourselves
.
<EOS>
I
hope
nothing
has
happened
to
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
motioning
me
to
follow
,
he
very
cautiously
crept
along
the
muddy
path
and
tried
the
gate
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
relocked
.
 
<EOS>
We
therefore
scaled
the
wall
without
further
ado
,
and
,
standing
in
the
little
front
garden
,
we
listened
breathlessly
at
the
door
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
Get
back
there
in
the
shadow
,
Jack
,
"
urged
my
friend
;
and
,
as
soon
as
I
was
concealed
,
he
passed
his
hand
along
the
lintel
of
the
door
,
where
he
found
the
bell
-
wire
from
the
gate
.
<EOS>
This
he
pulled
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
moments
later
the
old
woman
reappeared
at
the
door
,
passing
out
towards
the
gate
,
when
,
in
an
instant
,
Ray
and
I
were
within
,
and
flinging
open
a
door
on
the
left
of
the
narrow
passage
we
found
ourselves
confronted
by
the
exemplary
waiter
Klauber
and
a
companion
,
whose
short
beard
and
snub
nose
I
recognised
as
those
of
the
man
who
so
calmly
entered
the
naval
offices
a
couple
of
hours
before
.
 
<EOS>
For
them
our
sudden
appearance
was
,
no
doubt
,
a
dramatic
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
The
elder
man
gave
vent
to
a
quick
imprecation
in
German
,
while
Klauber
,
of
course
,
recognised
us
both
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
room
was
a
large
camera
with
a
flashlight
apparatus
,
while
pinned
upon
a
screen
before
the
camera
was
a
big
tracing
of
a
plan
of
one
of
the
chief
defensive
forts
which
the
spies
had
that
night
secured
from
Rosyth
,
and
which
they
were
now
in
the
act
of
photographing
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
lady
called
upon
you
here
an
hour
ago
,
"
exclaimed
Ray
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
she
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
lady
has
called
here
,
"
replied
the
bearded
German
in
very
good
English
,
adding
with
marvellous
coolness
,
"
To
what
,
pray
,
do
we
owe
this
unwarrantable
intrusion
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
the
fact
that
I
recognise
you
as
Josef
Scholtz
,
secret
agent
of
the
German
Naval
Intelligence
Department
,
"
answered
my
friend
resolutely
,
closing
the
door
and
standing
with
his
back
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
met
before
.
<EOS>
You
were
coming
down
the
steps
of
a
house
in
Pont
Street
,
London
,
where
lives
a
great
friend
of
yours
,
Hermann
Hartmann
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
asked
the
German
,
with
feigned
unconcern
,
and
before
we
could
prevent
him
he
had
torn
the
tracing
from
the
screen
,
roughly
folded
it
,
and
stuffed
it
into
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hand
that
to
me
,
"
commanded
my
friend
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
spy
only
laughed
in
open
defiance
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
intended
,
no
doubt
,
to
replace
that
as
you
have
done
the
others
after
photographing
them
.
<EOS>
Only
we
've
just
spoilt
your
game
,
"
Raymond
said
.
<EOS>
"
Both
Mr.
Wilkinson
and
Mr.
Farrar
are
,
I
see
from
the
list
,
members
of
the
Golf
Club
where
you"--and
he
looked
across
to
the
waiter--"are
employed
.
<EOS>
On
one
occasion
,
while
Mr.
Wilkinson
was
taking
a
bath
after
a
game
,
and
on
another
while
Mr.
Farrar
was
changing
his
coat
and
vest
,
you
contrived
to
take
wax
impressions
of
both
the
safe
keys
and
also
that
of
the
door
of
the
offices
.
<EOS>
The
keys
were
made
in
Glasgow
,
and
by
their
means
the
plans
of
our
new
naval
base
and
its
proposed
defences
have
been
at
your
disposal
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
--
there
's
no
law
against
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Scholtz
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
pass
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
First
give
me
that
tracing
,
"
demanded
my
friend
resolutely
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
.
<EOS>
Do
your
worst
!
"
<EOS>
the
German
replied
,
speaking
with
a
more
pronounced
accent
in
his
excitement
,
while
at
the
same
moment
I
saw
that
he
held
a
revolver
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
Ray
drew
his
own
weapon
,
but
,
instead
of
covering
the
spy
,
he
pointed
it
at
a
small
,
strong
wooden
box
upon
the
floor
in
the
opposite
corner
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gott
--
no
!
"
gasped
the
man
,
his
face
blanching
as
he
realised
Ray
's
intention
.
"
<EOS>
For
Heaven
's
sake
do
n't
.
<EOS>
I
--
I----
"
 
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
laughed
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
it
is
as
I
thought
.
<EOS>
You
two
blackguards
,
with
some
of
your
friends
<EOS>
,
I
expect
,
have
been
secretly
preparing
for
the
destruction
of
the
Forth
Bridge
on
'
the
Day'--as
you
are
so
fond
of
calling
it
.
<EOS>
The
staples
are
already
driven
in
,
and
the
unsuspicious
-
looking
wire
ropes
,
attached
to
which
the
boxes
of
gun
-
cotton
and
other
explosives
are
to
be
sunk
between
the
four
caissons
,
are
all
in
readiness
.
<EOS>
The
boat
from
a
German
merchant
vessel
off
Leith
,
signalled
at
intervals
by
your
assistant
Klauber
,
has
been
bringing
up
box
after
box
of
that
dangerous
stuff
and
landing
it
at
the
bottom
of
this
garden
;
so
that
within
an
hour
of
receiving
the
code
-
word
from
your
chief
,
you
would
be
able
to
wreck
the
whole
bridge
and
blow
it
into
the
water
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
spy
endeavoured
to
pass
,
but
seeing
Ray
's
determined
attitude
,
held
back
,
and
my
friend
compelled
him
to
lay
down
his
weapon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
,
"
said
my
friend
,
"
just
see
what
's
in
that
box
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
at
once
investigated
it
,
and
discovered
within
only
innocent
-
looking
tin
boxes
of
English
biscuits
.
<EOS>
The
three
tins
at
the
top
I
lifted
out
and
placed
on
the
floor
,
but
those
below
I
found
were
filled
with
circular
cakes
of
what
looked
like
felt
,
about
an
inch
in
thickness
,
each
with
a
hole
through
it
,
and
with
a
small
cavity
for
the
reception
of
the
detonator
.
<EOS>
I
showed
it
to
Ray
,
pointing
out
that
,
packed
with
it
,
were
several
smaller
tins
,
like
boxes
of
cigarettes
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
see
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
as
I
opened
one
.
<EOS>
"
Those
are
the
detonators
,
filled
with
fulminate
of
mercury
.
"
 
"
Let
us
pass
!
"
cried
both
the
spies
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
before
you
are
searched
<EOS>
shall
you
leave
this
house
!
"
was
the
quick
reply
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
resist
,
I
shall
fire
into
one
of
those
boxes
of
detonators
,
and
blow
you
to
atoms
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
yourselves
also
!
"
remarked
Klauber
,
his
face
pale
as
death
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
at
least
prevent
our
secrets
falling
into
your
hands
,
and
at
the
same
time
bring
the
truth
home
to
the
British
Government
!
"
<EOS>
was
my
friend
's
unwavering
answer
.
 
<EOS>
Next
moment
both
men
made
a
dash
towards
the
door
,
but
I
had
drawn
my
weapon
and
was
upon
my
guard
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
flash
,
followed
by
a
deafening
report
,
as
Ray
fired
at
the
box
,
aiming
wide
on
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
two
spies
,
seeing
that
they
had
to
deal
with
a
man
who
was
a
patriot
to
his
heart
's
core
,
realised
that
their
game
was
up
.
 
<EOS>
Sullenly
Scholtz
put
down
his
weapon
,
and
I
searched
both
men
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
pocket
of
the
exemplary
waiter
I
drew
forth
a
rough
plan
,
together
with
some
scribbled
notes
in
German
,
which
afterwards
proved
to
be
a
description
of
the
forts
on
Inchkeith
,
while
from
the
pocket
of
Scholtz
<EOS>
I
secured
the
tracing
he
had
stolen
from
Rosyth
.
 
<EOS>
Then
we
allowed
both
the
secret
agents
of
the
Kaiser
to
pass
out
,
much
to
the
consternation
and
alarm
of
the
deaf
old
Scotchwoman
,
who
had
,
at
their
request
,
posed
as
the
occupier
of
the
cottage
,
but
who
,
in
perfect
ignorance
of
what
was
in
progress
,
had
acted
as
their
housekeeper
.
 
<EOS>
A
swift
examination
of
the
premises
revealed
no
trace
of
Vera
.
<EOS>
But
we
found
in
the
cellar
below
the
room
where
we
had
found
the
spies
a
great
store
of
gun
-
cotton
and
other
high
explosives
of
German
manufacture
,
intended
for
the
wrecking
of
the
bridge
;
while
in
an
old
battered
portmanteau
in
one
of
the
upstairs
rooms
we
also
found
,
all
ready
for
conveyance
to
Germany
,
a
quantity
of
prints
from
the
photographic
negatives
in
the
room
below
--
photographs
of
nearly
the
whole
of
the
plans
of
Rosyth
,
and
more
especially
of
its
proposed
forts
--
which
the
men
had
been
in
the
habit
of
abstracting
at
night
and
replacing
in
the
safe
before
dawn
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
Raymond
was
in
active
search
of
something
else
besides
,
and
at
length
discovered
what
he
sought
--
two
German
military
telegraph
instruments
,
together
with
a
complete
and
very
ingenious
arrangement
for
the
tapping
of
wire
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
Jove
!
"
exclaimed
my
friend
,
who
took
a
keen
interest
in
all
things
electrical
.
<EOS>
"
This
will
now
come
in
very
handy
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
on
going
outside
to
the
telegraph
pole
against
the
wall
,
he
clambered
up
it
and
attached
wires
to
two
of
the
insulators
.
<EOS>
Then
descending
,
he
screwed
a
little
brass
box
upon
it
into
those
same
three
holes
in
the
black
wood
which
had
attracted
him
on
the
night
of
our
arrival
,
and
a
moment
later
began
manipulating
the
key
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
picked
up
Inverkeithing
,
and
asked
them
to
send
the
police
over
at
once
.
<EOS>
We
must
n't
leave
the
place
and
risk
the
spies
returning
for
any
of
their
paraphernalia
.
<EOS>
The
disappearance
of
Vera
,
however
,
worries
me
.
<EOS>
I
sent
her
here
with
a
note
purporting
to
come
from
the
chief
of
the
German
Secret
Service
in
England
,
Hermann
Hartmann
;
but
she
has
vanished
,
and
we
must
,
as
soon
as
the
police
arrive
,
go
in
search
of
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
completely
had
we
unmasked
the
spies
that
I
stood
puzzled
and
amazed
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
,
noticing
my
attitude
,
made
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Several
of
my
surmises
in
this
case
proved
entirely
correct
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
My
first
suspicion
was
aroused
that
if
spies
were
about
,
they
would
probably
prepare
for
tapping
the
telegraph
lines
,
and
,
as
you
know
,
I
soon
discovered
evidence
of
it
.
<EOS>
Then
those
staples
in
the
foundations
of
the
bridge
gave
me
a
further
clue
to
the
work
in
progress
,
a
suspicion
greatly
strengthened
by
the
signal
light
shown
by
the
man
Klauber
.
<EOS>
The
two
men
who
held
the
safe
keys
being
members
of
the
Golf
Club
aroused
a
theory
which
proved
the
correct
one
,
and
on
tracing
back
the
career
of
the
waiter
I
made
a
remarkable
discovery
which
left
no
doubt
as
to
his
real
profession
.
<EOS>
It
seems
that
while
employed
at
the
Cafe
de
l'Europe
in
London
,
he
lodged
at
the
house
of
Mrs.
Jephson
,
in
Shepherd
's
Bush
,
and
became
extremely
friendly
with
the
widow
's
son
.
<EOS>
Now
you
'll
remember
that
a
few
days
before
the
poor
fellow
's
death
he
was
absent
mysteriously
,
and
on
his
return
he
told
his
mother
in
confidence
that
there
would
shortly
be
something
in
the
papers
about
himself
.
<EOS>
Well
,
the
truth
is
now
quite
plain
.
<EOS>
During
his
absence
he
evidently
came
up
here
.
<EOS>
Young
Jephson
,
who
knew
German
,
had
found
out
that
his
German
friend
was
a
spy
,
and
had
no
doubt
secured
the
document
afterwards
found
upon
him
as
evidence
.
<EOS>
Klauber
was
ignorant
of
this
,
though
he
suspected
that
his
secret
was
out
.
<EOS>
In
deadly
fear
of
exposure
,
he
then
plotted
to
silence
the
young
Englishman
,
inducing
him
to
walk
along
the
towing
-
path
between
Hammersmith
and
Barnes
,
where
he
no
doubt
pushed
him
into
the
river
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
have
found
a
witness
who
saw
the
two
men
together
in
King
Street
,
Hammersmith
,
on
the
evening
of
the
poor
fellow
's
disappearance
.
<EOS>
The
plan
which
Reitmeyer
saw
is
,
I
find
,
fortunately
one
of
the
discarded
ones
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Extraordinary
!
<EOS>
"
I
declared
,
absorbed
by
what
he
had
related
.
"
<EOS>
But
while
you
've
wrested
from
Germany
the
secrets
of
some
of
our
most
important
defences
,
you
have
,
my
dear
Ray
,
temporarily
lost
the
woman
you
love
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
first
duty
,
Jack
,
is
to
my
King
and
my
country
,
"
he
declared
,
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
table
in
the
spies
'
photographic
studio
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
tried
to
perform
it
to
-
night
,
and
have
,
fortunately
,
exposed
the
German
activity
in
our
midst
.
<EOS>
When
the
police
arrive
to
view
this
spies
'
nest
,
we
must
at
once
search
for
her
who
is
always
my
confidante
,
and
to
whose
woman
's
wits
and
foresight
this
success
is
in
no
small
measure
due
.
<EOS>

CHAPTER
II
 
THE
SECRET
OF
THE
SILENT
SUBMARINE
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
most
mysterious
affair
,
no
doubt
,
"
I
remarked
.
"
<EOS>
Has
anything
further
been
discovered
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Jack
,
"
replied
my
friend
Ray
Raymond
,
rolling
a
fresh
cigarette
between
his
fingers
.
<EOS>
"
On
investigation
,
the
mystery
grows
more
complicated
,
more
remarkable
,
and
--
for
us
--
much
more
interesting
.
"
 
<EOS>
We
were
seated
together
in
our
dismal
chambers
in
New
Stone
Buildings
,
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
one
wet
afternoon
about
six
weeks
after
the
Forth
Bridge
affair
.
<EOS>
With
us
,
lolling
in
the
shabby
old
easy
chair
beside
the
fire
,
sat
Vera
Vallance
,
in
a
big
black
hat
,
with
her
muff
and
coat
thrown
aside
.
<EOS>
Her
disappearance
at
North
Queensferry
had
been
of
only
brief
duration
,
for
we
had
discovered
her
hiding
at
the
bottom
of
the
long
garden
,
close
to
the
water
's
edge
,
watching
the
landing
of
two
small
boxes
from
a
boat
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
that
the
two
men
,
Scholtz
and
Klauber
,
on
receipt
of
the
note
purporting
to
come
from
their
director
,
Hermann
Hartmann
,
in
London
,
had
asked
her
to
wait
in
an
adjoining
room
while
they
wrote
a
reply
.
<EOS>
But
from
there
she
had
slipped
out
,
and
concealed
herself
in
the
garden
to
wait
and
watch
.
 
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
ago
she
had
come
to
my
gloomy
chambers
with
her
fiance
,
in
order
,
as
he
explained
,
to
consult
with
us
.
<EOS>
She
was
at
present
on
a
visit
to
her
married
sister
who
lived
in
Argyll
Road
,
near
Kensington
High
Street
,
hence
they
were
daily
in
each
other
's
company
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Jack
,
very
little
has
been
allowed
to
leak
out
to
the
papers
,
"
Ray
exclaimed
as
he
lit
his
cigarette
and
took
up
a
position
with
his
back
to
the
fire
.

As
soon
as
I
read
of
the
discovery
I
ran
down
to
Scotland
Yard
,
saw
Evans
,
and
explained
my
theory
.
<EOS>
He
was
inclined
to
agree
with
me
,
and
at
once
gave
orders
that
no
facts
were
to
be
given
to
the
Press
.
<EOS>
Upon
complete
secrecy
,
our
success
now
depends
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
know
what
I
've
read
in
the
papers
,
"
I
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
us
the
whole
facts
,
Ray
,
"
urged
the
pretty
fair
-
haired
girl
,
who
sat
with
her
veil
raised
and
her
long
white
gloves
laid
across
her
knees
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
dear
,
they
are
briefly
as
follows
,
"
he
replied
,
with
an
affectionate
glance
at
her
.

<EOS>
Last
Thursday
afternoon
,
on
the
arrival
at
4.51
of
a
train
from
Guildford
at
Vauxhall
,
the
ticket
-
collector
discovered
lying
on
the
floor
of
a
third
-
class
compartment
a
middle
-
aged
,
respectably
dressed
man
in
an
apparently
dying
condition
.
<EOS>
The
police
were
called
,
and
he
was
conveyed
to
St.
Thomas
's
Hospital
,
where
it
was
found
that
he
was
suffering
from
a
severe
fracture
of
the
skull
,
the
wound
having
been
inflicted
probably
with
a
loaded
stick
or
a
life
-
preserver
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
severe
cut
over
the
right
eye
and
a
great
gash
down
the
left
cheek
.
<EOS>
The
man
was
unconscious
,
and
still
remains
so
.
<EOS>
The
doctors
have
grave
doubts
<EOS>
whether
,
even
if
he
recovers
,
his
mind
will
not
be
permanently
affected
.
<EOS>
In
all
probability
he
will
never
regain
his
right
mind
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Terrible
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Vera
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
A
case
of
attempted
murder
,
no
doubt
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
what
first
attracted
my
notice
was
the
statement
that
the
man
had
been
identified
as
Max
Steinheim
,
a
German
hairdresser
employed
in
a
shop
in
New
Bond
Street
,
who
had
been
missing
for
nearly
two
months
.
<EOS>
He
resided
in
Hargwynne
Street
,
Stockwell
,
and
as
he
owed
a
considerable
sum
to
his
landlady
,
she
had
given
notice
to
the
police
of
his
disappearance
.
<EOS>
It
was
she
who
had
identified
him
in
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
as
far
as
the
information
conveyed
by
the
newspapers
carries
the
affair
,
"
I
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Exactly
.
<EOS>
But
we
are
able
to
proceed
a
little
farther
,
to
a
matter
which
must
be
closely
investigated
,
"
continued
Raymond
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
the
arrival
of
the
train
at
Waterloo
the
compartment
,
which
showed
signs
of
a
desperate
struggle
,
was
searched
,
and
under
the
seat
was
discovered
a
small
piece
of
paper
tightly
screwed
up
into
a
small
ball
as
though
somebody
wished
to
get
rid
of
it
unobserved
.
<EOS>
Upon
it
,
in
a
distinctly
foreign
hand
,
and
in
violet
ink
--
which
,
by
the
way
,
is
seldom
used
by
Englishmen
--
were
traced
some
cryptic
memoranda
,
a
copy
of
which
I
have
here
,
"
and
he
handed
for
our
inspection
a
piece
of
paper
which
presented
this
appearance
:

"
You
've
endeavoured
to
decipher
it
,
of
course
<EOS>
,
"
I
remarked
,
as
both
Vera
and
I
gazed
at
the
puzzling
array
of
numerals
and
words
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
.
<EOS>
For
the
past
three
days
I
've
indeed
done
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
the
result
is
not
very
reassuring
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Deciphered
by
one
of
the
little
-
known
codes
,
the
figures
19505
stand
for
'
January
24th
,
'
which
is
four
days
before
the
murderous
assault
.
<EOS>
Kingscliffe
is
the
name
of
a
village
in
Northamptonshire
,
on
the
North
Western
line
between
Peterborough
and
Rugby
.
<EOS>
The
12.15
from
St.
Pancras
is
a
restaurant
train
for
Derby
,
and
takes
passengers
to
Weldon
and
Corby
station
,
by
changing
at
Kettering
,
and
the
distance
'
1
mile
'
would
bring
the
traveller
to
the
village
of
Great
Weldon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Royal
Pier
sounds
like
the
name
of
a
hotel
,
"
I
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
a
good
many
Royal
Pier
hotels
in
England
,
so
there
we
are
confronted
with
a
difficulty
.
<EOS>
To
what
6.11
refers
I
can
not
conceive
,
while
Harpur
Street
,
which
is
off
Theobalds
Road
,
I
visited
yesterday
,
but
I
find
there
are
no
such
numbers
as
248
or
392
.
<EOS>
The
next
line
is
unintelligible
,
but
if
I
read
the
last
line
aright
it
is
an
appointment
made
beneath
the
clock
at
Charing
Cross
Station
at
six
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
drew
hard
at
my
pipe
.
<EOS>
That
strange
document
presented
to
me
a
very
complicated
puzzle
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
refer
to
some
district
in
Northamptonshire
,
yet
he
was
attacked
coming
up
from
Guildford
,
on
the
South
Western
line
!
"
<EOS>
Vera
remarked
.
"
<EOS>
Is
your
only
suspicion
based
upon
the
fact
of
the
injured
man
's
nationality
,
Ray
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
,
combined
with
other
circumstances
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
I
read
the
first
announcement
in
the
papers
,
I
went
down
to
Guildford
and
there
ascertained
that
the
injured
man
arrived
at
the
Angel
Hotel
in
a
motor
-
car
about
one
o'clock
.
<EOS>
The
chauffeur
remarked
to
the
ostler
that
he
had
come
up
from
the
south
coast
,
and
after
having
a
drink
he
started
off
on
the
return
journey
.
<EOS>
Steinheim
had
luncheon
upstairs
,
took
his
coffee
and
cigarette
in
the
little
room
below
,
and
idled
about
,
telling
the
lady
bookkeeper
of
the
hotel
that
he
was
expecting
a
friend
.
<EOS>
The
friend
in
question
did
not
,
however
,
arrive
,
therefore
he
walked
down
to
the
station
,
and
left
at
4.13
for
London
.
<EOS>
A
porter
remembers
seeing
him
alone
in
the
compartment
,
and
it
seems
quite
certain
that
,
on
starting
from
Guildford
,
he
was
still
alone
.
<EOS>
The
train
was
an
express
,
and
timed
not
to
stop
anywhere
from
Guildford
to
Vauxhall
,
but
,
from
the
railway
officials
,
I
find
that
it
was
pulled
up
by
signal
about
a
mile
from
Esher
,
in
which
time
he
may
have
been
joined
by
some
one
from
the
adjoining
compartment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
your
theory
is
that
the
man
who
attacked
this
mysterious
German
got
back
again
to
his
carriage
,
and
alighted
at
Vauxhall
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
think
so
,
for
the
driver
says
that
outside
Clapham
Junction
the
signals
were
against
him
,
and
he
pulled
up
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
pity
he
has
not
sufficiently
recovered
to
make
any
statement
.
"
 
<EOS>
Ray
smiled
grimly
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
would
never
do
that
,
I
think
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
to
his
advantage
to
conceal
the
facts
,
if
my
deductions
prove
correct
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
those
all
the
known
circumstances
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
much
interested
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
one
other
.
<EOS>
A
week
after
the
man
's
disappearance
from
Stockwell
,
his
landlady
received
a
letter
bearing
the
postmark
of
Crawley
in
Sussex
,
telling
her
not
to
trouble
on
his
account
.
<EOS>
He
wrote
:
'
I
am
engaged
upon
an
important
mission
,
but
shall
return
home
within
ten
days
,
when
I
will
pay
all
I
owe
you
.
<EOS>
Do
not
trouble
after
me
.
<EOS>
Burn
this
letter
as
soon
as
you
have
read
it.--MAX
STEINHEIM
.
'
<EOS>
The
other
fact
I
learned
from
the
man
's
employer
,
an
Englishman
in
New
Bond
Street
.
<EOS>
It
appears
that
to
the
establishment
there
often
came
a
stout
,
well
-
dressed
,
prosperous
-
looking
German
gentleman
who
waited
for
Steinheim
to
shave
him
,
or
cut
his
hair
,
and
on
such
occasions
it
was
noticed
that
they
exchanged
whispered
words
in
their
own
tongue
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
asked
Vera
,
looking
up
at
her
lover
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
stout
German
's
description
tallies
exactly
with
that
of
Hermann
Hartmann
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
see
,
"
I
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
certainly
not
been
idle
,
Ray
.
"
<EOS>
And
with
my
eyes
fixed
upon
that
puzzling
array
of
figures
and
words
,
I
added
,
"
If
we
could
only
decipher
the
whole
of
these
we
might
elucidate
the
truth
.
"
 
"
The
injured
man
's
knowledge
of
Hartmann
,
the
crafty
chief
of
the
German
Secret
Service
in
London
,
is
certainly
suspicious
,
"
Vera
remarked
.
"
But
can
not
some
information
be
gathered
from
the
landlady
at
Hargwynne
Street
?
<EOS>
He
may
have
had
visitors
there
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
if
he
did
,
they
would
speak
in
German
,
which
the
good
lady
could
not
understand
,
"
her
lover
replied
thoughtfully
,
contemplating
the
end
of
his
cigarette
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
could
be
no
harm
in
seeing
the
good
lady
,
"
the
girl
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
over
to
-
morrow
and
have
a
chat
with
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
in
the
meantime
Jack
and
I
will
pursue
another
line
of
inquiry
,
"
remarked
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Vera
rose
,
a
tall
,
fair
-
haired
,
and
sweet
-
faced
figure
in
black
,
and
seating
herself
at
the
table
,
served
us
our
tea
.
<EOS>
She
was
no
stranger
at
our
chambers
,
and
as
an
Admiral
's
daughter
,
the
question
of
German
spies
in
England
,
which
her
lover
had
taken
up
so
strongly
,
interested
her
most
keenly
.
<EOS>
The
Forth
Bridge
peril
had
already
impressed
a
great
and
serious
truth
upon
the
Government
,
but
Ray
Raymond
's
success
had
only
whetted
his
appetite
for
further
exploration
and
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
on
the
following
morning
I
called
at
his
chambers
in
Bruton
Street
--
a
tastefully
furnished
bachelor
suite
,
the
art
green
and
blues
of
which
were
scarcely
in
keeping
with
his
serious
,
earnest
character
--
and
together
we
drove
in
a
taxi
-
cab
to
St.
Thomas
's
Hospital
,
where
,
in
the
accident
ward
,
we
stood
at
the
bedside
of
the
mysterious
Steinheim
.
<EOS>
His
head
was
enveloped
in
surgical
bandages
,
but
during
the
night
he
had
regained
consciousness
.
<EOS>
To
the
questions
we
put
to
him
,
however
,
we
obtained
no
satisfactory
replies
.
<EOS>
His
mind
seemed
to
be
a
perfect
blank
as
to
what
had
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
read
the
copy
of
those
cryptic
figures
upon
the
scrap
of
paper
found
in
the
railway
carriage
.
<EOS>
When
my
friend
pronounced
the
name
of
the
station
"
Weldon
and
Corby
,
"
the
invalid
's
big
grey
eyes
started
from
his
head
as
he
exclaimed
in
German
:
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Yes
--
yes
.
<EOS>
At
Weldon
.
<EOS>
She
was
at
Weldon
!
"
 
<EOS>
Who
was
"
she
"
?
<EOS>
In
vain
we
tried
to
wring
from
him
some
reply
to
this
question
,
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
Mention
of
Hermann
Hartmann
,
the
ingenious
and
fearless
secret
agent
who
controlled
so
cleverly
the
vast
army
of
German
spies
spread
over
our
smiling
land
of
England
,
brought
no
responsive
expression
to
the
man
's
white
,
drawn
face
.
<EOS>
It
was
indeed
apparent
that
his
intention
was
to
hold
back
at
all
hazards
the
truth
regarding
the
murderous
attack
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
himself
was
guilty
of
some
offence
,
or
perhaps
he
intended
to
hold
his
peace
then
and
to
retaliate
at
a
moment
when
his
assailant
thought
himself
most
secure
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
big
,
burly
,
strong
-
featured
man
,
just
the
type
of
heavy
-
limbed
German
who
might
be
expected
to
bear
a
murderous
malice
against
any
who
did
him
injury
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
more
than
ever
convinced
that
Hartmann
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
curious
affair
,
"
Ray
declared
,
as
we
walked
together
across
Westminster
Bridge
<EOS>
and
I
crossed
with
him
to
the
St.
Stephen
's
Club
,
at
the
corner
of
the
Embankment
.
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
I
can
discover
,
the
man
was
always
in
possession
of
ample
funds
.
<EOS>
Yet
to
his
landlady
he
was
careful
never
to
reveal
that
he
had
money
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
no
doubt
,
some
hidden
reason
for
this
,
as
well
as
for
the
letter
he
wrote
to
the
woman
after
his
departure
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
mystery
surrounding
the
affair
grows
more
fascinating
as
we
proceed
,
"
I
declared
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
if
the
deduction
I
have
made
this
morning
proves
to
be
the
correct
one
,
Jack
,
the
mystery
will
still
increase
.
<EOS>
There
's
some
very
crooked
business
in
progress
,
depend
upon
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
That
afternoon
I
had
to
make
an
application
in
the
Chancery
Court
,
therefore
it
was
not
until
after
dinner
that
I
again
sat
in
one
of
the
green
velvet
chairs
in
his
art
-
green
sitting
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
Contrary
to
his
usual
habit
,
he
had
not
dressed
,
but
still
wore
the
brown
tweed
suit
which
he
had
had
on
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
brought
what
I
asked
you
over
the
'
phone
?
<EOS>
"
he
inquired
,
as
soon
as
I
entered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
replied
,
opening
the
well
-
worn
leather
brief
bag
which
I
carried
,
and
displaying
a
dark
lantern
,
a
coil
of
strong
silk
rope
,
and
a
small
but
serviceable
jemmy
.
<EOS>
All
that
burglarious
outfit
belonged
to
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
Right
,
"
he
exclaimed
,
stroking
his
smooth
-
shaven
chin
.
"
<EOS>
Have
a
pipe
.
<EOS>
We
'll
leave
here
about
ten
.
<EOS>
We
are
going
to
spend
the
night
in
Pont
Street
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
pointed
to
a
silver
flask
and
a
paper
of
sandwiches
upon
the
sideboard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Vera
has
seen
the
landlady
in
Stockwell
,
but
can
make
nothing
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
's
as
deaf
as
a
post
.
<EOS>
She
returned
home
to
Portsmouth
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
smoked
together
until
ten
,
he
consuming
cigarette
after
cigarette
in
that
quick
,
nervous
manner
which
showed
the
volcano
of
excitement
raging
within
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
think
why
the
mention
of
Weldon
and
Corby
should
have
so
excited
our
friend
this
morning
.
<EOS>
To
me
it
seemed
as
though
he
retained
rather
bitter
memories
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
there
was
a
woman
in
the
case
,
without
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Jack
,
I
shall
go
down
there
and
have
a
look
round
as
soon
as
I
have
a
chance
.
<EOS>
From
the
ordnance
map
this
place
seems
quite
a
small
one
.
<EOS>
The
station
is
at
Corby
,
while
Little
Weldon
and
Great
Weldon
are
about
a
mile
distant
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
just
a
chance
,
of
course
,
that
you
might
pick
up
something
there
,
"
I
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
yet
what
I
surmise
leads
me
in
entirely
an
opposite
direction
.
<EOS>
There
are
no
defences
or
secrets
in
Northamptonshire
,
remember
.
<EOS>
"
 
Once
more
he
took
from
his
writing
-
table
the
piece
of
paper
whereon
was
a
copy
of
the
strange
array
of
figures
found
in
the
railway
carriage
at
Waterloo
.
<EOS>
But
at
last
he
shook
his
head
and
laid
it
aside
with
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
The
mystery
remained
as
complete
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
good
deal
that
's
suspicious
about
Hartmann
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
that
's
why
we
are
going
to
Pont
Street
?
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
As
I
've
explained
,
he
's
believed
to
be
a
money
-
lender
with
an
office
in
Cork
Street
,
and
is
registered
as
such
,
in
order
that
no
one
should
be
surprised
at
the
constant
callers
at
his
house
.
<EOS>
He
receives
visits
from
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
--
and
women
,
but
observation
which
I
have
placed
upon
the
house
has
convinced
me
that
the
majority
of
these
people
are
German
agents
of
whom
he
is
the
guiding
spirit
and
paymaster
,
and
among
whom
he
is
all
-
powerful
.
<EOS>
Payment
is
made
through
him
for
all
confidential
services
rendered
to
the
Fatherland
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
the
police
do
not
suspect
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
fellow
,
have
not
the
police
received
orders
from
our
Government
to
close
their
eyes
to
the
doings
of
these
gentry
?
<EOS>
England
is
the
paradise
of
the
spy
,
and
will
remain
so
until
we
can
bring
pressure
to
bear
to
compel
the
introduction
of
fresh
legislation
against
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
half
-
past
ten
a
taxi
-
cab
deposited
us
in
Sloane
Street
,
and
together
we
turned
into
Pont
Street
,
walking
leisurely
past
a
medium
-
sized
red
-
fronted
house
approached
by
a
flight
of
steps
leading
to
a
deep
portico
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
light
in
the
first
-
floor
window
of
what
was
evidently
the
drawing
-
room
but
the
rest
of
the
house
of
the
arch
-
spy
of
Germany
was
in
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
passed
the
house
,
my
friend
examined
its
highly
respectable
exterior
.
<EOS>
Then
we
passed
on
to
the
end
of
the
thoroughfare
,
in
order
to
attract
no
attention
.
<EOS>
A
constable
passed
us
,
and
in
order
to
avoid
being
noticed
we
walked
together
for
some
distance
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
however
,
Ray
turned
back
,
and
gaining
the
house
adjoining
Hartmann
's
,
ran
swiftly
up
the
steps
into
the
shadow
of
the
portico
,
I
following
at
his
heels
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
few
seconds
he
had
opened
the
door
with
a
latch
-
key
he
carried
in
his
hand
,
and
next
moment
we
were
within
the
wide
,
echoing
hall
,
for
the
house
was
empty
,
and
to
let
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
called
upon
the
agent
,
and
had
a
look
over
this
place
a
few
days
ago
,
"
he
explained
.
<EOS>
"
On
that
occasion
,
I
had
the
key
in
my
hand
for
a
moment
,
and
obtained
an
impression
of
it
,
"
and
switching
on
his
electric
torch
he
showed
the
square
hall
with
the
flight
of
stairs
ascending
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
Gaining
the
big
drawing
-
room
,
Ray
crossed
to
the
long
French
window
on
the
left
and
gazed
cautiously
out
upon
the
street
below
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
I
noticed
the
figure
of
a
man
in
a
dark
overcoat
and
felt
hat
cross
from
the
opposite
pavement
and
ascend
the
stairs
of
the
house
next
door
.
<EOS>
Ray
glanced
at
his
watch
,
which
he
could
see
by
the
light
of
the
street
lamp
outside
.
<EOS>
Noticing
the
time
,
he
became
reassured
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Jack
,
that
from
here
runs
a
balcony
leading
to
that
of
Hartmann
's
house
.
<EOS>
We
must
creep
along
it
and
try
and
get
a
peep
of
our
friend
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
've
watched
that
drawing
-
room
window
for
a
long
time
,
and
I
believe
that
he
makes
it
his
business
room
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Carefully
he
unfastened
the
French
window
,
and
bending
low
so
as
to
escape
the
observation
of
any
person
passing
by
<EOS>
,
we
both
crept
along
the
narrow
balcony
until
,
by
swinging
from
one
balustrade
to
the
other
,
we
found
ourselves
standing
over
Hartmann
's
portico
.
 
<EOS>
Even
from
where
we
stood
we
could
hear
voices
.
<EOS>
Forward
we
crept
again
until
we
were
outside
the
windows
of
the
drawing
-
room
,
crouching
so
that
no
inquisitive
policeman
could
detect
us
.
 
<EOS>
The
blind
of
the
window
at
which
I
listened
did
not
fit
well
,
therefore
,
through
the
small
crack
,
I
was
enabled
to
peer
within
.
<EOS>
The
room
was
a
large
,
well
-
furnished
one
with
a
fire
burning
brightly
;
near
it
stood
a
large
roll
-
top
writing
-
table
at
which
sat
a
fat
,
flabby
,
sardonic
-
faced
man
of
about
fifty
-
five
.
<EOS>
He
had
grey
eyes
full
of
craft
and
cunning
,
a
prominent
nose
,
and
a
short
-
cropped
grey
beard
.
<EOS>
Ray
whispered
that
it
was
the
great
Hartmann
.
 
<EOS>
Near
the
fire
,
seated
nervously
on
the
extreme
edge
of
a
chair
,
was
a
respectably
dressed
man
,
a
German
evidently
,
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
The
man
presented
the
appearance
of
a
hard
-
working
mechanic
,
and
was
obviously
ill
at
ease
.
 
<EOS>
We
watched
them
in
conversation
,
but
could
not
distinguish
one
single
word
of
what
was
said
.
<EOS>
All
we
could
gather
was
that
the
fat
man
was
overbearing
in
his
manner
,
and
that
the
visitor
was
most
humble
and
subservient
against
his
will
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
full
half
-
hour
we
watched
,
but
unable
to
gather
anything
further
,
we
were
compelled
to
return
to
the
house
next
door
and
regain
the
street
,
where
for
still
twenty
minutes
longer
we
waited
for
the
visitor
's
exit
.
<EOS>
When
at
last
he
came
forth
we
followed
him
to
the
corner
of
Knightsbridge
,
opposite
<EOS>
the
Hyde
Park
Hotel
,
where
he
boarded
a
motor
-
bus
,
from
which
he
eventually
descended
at
the
corner
of
Gray
's
Inn
Road
walking
thence
to
a
house
in
Harpur
Street
,
Bloomsbury
,
where
we
later
on
discovered
he
lodged
,
under
the
name
of
Leon
Karff
.
 
<EOS>
The
nature
of
the
mission
entrusted
to
this
man
,
if
one
had
actually
been
entrusted
to
him
,
was
a
mystery
,
yet
it
was
a
curious
fact
that
"
Harpur
Street
"
appeared
upon
that
scrap
of
paper
which
to
us
was
such
an
enigma
.
 
<EOS>
Next
morning
at
six
o'clock
,
I
was
already
idling
,
at
the
corner
of
Harpur
Street
and
Theobalds
Road
,
but
not
until
three
hours
later
did
the
foreigner
emerge
and
walk
toward
Holborn
.
<EOS>
Thence
<EOS>
he
took
a
motor
-
bus
back
to
Sloane
Street
,
and
calling
upon
Hartmann
,
spent
another
half
an
hour
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
afterwards
he
went
straight
home
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
about
noon
,
and
having
an
engagement
in
Court
,
I
was
compelled
to
relinquish
my
vigil
.
<EOS>
But
at
a
little
after
five
Ray
entered
our
chambers
,
exclaiming
:
 
"
As
I
expected
!
<EOS>
That
man
Karff
has
been
to
see
Steinheim
in
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
I
was
there
awaiting
him
,
believing
that
he
might
visit
him
.
<EOS>
Apparently
the
injured
man
has
given
him
certain
instructions
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
About
what
?
"
 
<EOS>
Ray
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
blank
ignorance
.
<EOS>
Then
he
said
,
"
We
have
advanced
one
step
toward
the
solution
of
the
problem
,
my
dear
Jack
.
<EOS>
But
we
have
not
gone
very
far
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
took
the
copy
of
the
cryptogram
from
my
writing
-
table
and
again
examined
it
.
<EOS>
The
figures
"
6.11
"
puzzled
him
.
<EOS>
Many
times
he
referred
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Four
days
passed
,
during
which
we
kept
strict
observation
upon
Karff
and
followed
him
wherever
he
went
.
<EOS>
On
the
fifth
day
,
Ray
having
spent
all
the
morning
watching
him
,
to
relieve
him
I
walked
along
the
Theobalds
Road
a
few
minutes
before
one
and
paused
,
as
usual
,
before
the
oil
shop
at
the
corner
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
sign
of
my
friend
,
and
though
I
waited
through
the
whole
of
that
cold
afternoon
and
evening
,
continuing
my
wearisome
vigil
till
midnight
,
yet
he
did
not
come
.
 
<EOS>
Much
surprised
,
I
returned
to
New
Stone
Buildings
,
where
I
found
a
telegram
from
Ray
,
sent
from
Waterloo
Station
at
three
o'clock
,
telling
me
that
all
was
right
,
and
urging
me
to
await
further
information
.
 
<EOS>
This
I
did
.
<EOS>
For
a
whole
week
I
possessed
myself
in
patience
,
not
knowing
where
Ray
was
or
what
had
befallen
him
.
<EOS>
That
he
was
on
the
trail
of
a
solution
of
the
mystery
was
evident
,
but
he
sent
me
no
word
of
his
whereabouts
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
apparent
,
however
,
that
he
was
no
longer
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
Eleven
days
after
his
disappearance
I
one
afternoon
received
another
telegram
,
which
had
been
handed
in
at
Chichester
,
asking
me
to
go
at
once
to
the
Queen
's
Hotel
at
Southsea
,
where
he
would
meet
me
at
ten
o'clock
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
hour
appointed
I
awaited
him
in
my
bedroom
overlooking
Southsea
Common
and
the
harbour
,
and
at
last
he
joined
me
.
<EOS>
I
saw
by
the
serious
expression
upon
his
face
that
something
unusual
had
happened
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
fellow
Karff
has
realised
that
I
'm
following
him
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
Therefore
you
must
take
the
matter
up
.
<EOS>
He
's
in
the
service
of
a
greengrocer
in
Queen
Street
,
close
to
the
Hard
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
yet
discovered
his
game
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
there
was
left
to
me
a
very
difficult
matter
,
a
mystery
which
I
exerted
every
effort
to
unravel
.
<EOS>
For
the
next
fortnight
I
watched
the
fellow
incessantly
,
being
relieved
sometimes
by
the
pretty
daughter
of
the
Admiral
Superintendent
,
whose
home
was
fortunately
in
the
Dockyard
.
<EOS>
In
all
weathers
and
at
all
times
we
watched
,
but
we
failed
to
discover
anything
.
<EOS>
Ray
remained
at
the
hotel
impatient
and
inactive
,
and
I
must
admit
that
more
than
once
I
was
inclined
to
believe
that
he
had
been
mistaken
in
his
surmises
.
<EOS>
Leon
Karff
was
,
as
far
as
we
could
discover
,
a
hard
-
working
foreigner
,
driven
by
force
of
circumstances
into
adopting
the
lowly
calling
of
a
greengrocer
's
assistant
.
<EOS>
His
employer
supplied
with
fruit
and
vegetables
the
officers
'
messes
of
several
of
the
ships
in
the
Dockyard
,
and
on
infrequent
occasions
he
drove
in
the
light
cart
with
his
master
when
on
his
rounds
taking
orders
.
 
<EOS>
This
round
at
last
<EOS>
he
was
in
the
habit
of
making
three
times
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
One
Saturday
morning
,
as
I
was
idling
along
the
Hard
,
I
saw
Karff
and
his
master
,
a
man
named
Mitchell
,
drive
in
past
the
policeman
at
the
main
gate
.
<EOS>
But
though
I
waited
for
over
three
hours
to
watch
their
exit
,
they
did
not
reappear
.
 
<EOS>
Much
surprised
at
this
,
I
walked
round
to
the
Unicorn
Gate
,
at
Landport
,
where
,
on
making
judicious
inquiries
of
the
policeman
on
duty
,
I
learnt
that
Mitchell
had
driven
out
--
but
alone
!
<EOS>
His
assistant
,
he
said
,
had
been
sent
back
on
foot
with
a
message
through
the
main
gate
just
when
the
dockyard
men
or
"
maties
,
"
as
they
are
called
,
were
leaving
work
at
midday
.
 
<EOS>
Now
having
stood
at
that
gate
when
the
throngs
had
poured
forth
,
I
was
quite
certain
he
had
not
emerged
.
<EOS>
But
I
kept
my
own
counsel
,
and
returned
to
Southsea
,
deep
in
my
own
reflections
.
 
<EOS>
On
taking
counsel
with
Ray
,
he
at
once
telephoned
to
Vera
at
Admiralty
House
,
and
an
hour
later
we
all
three
discussed
the
situation
,
it
being
arranged
that
the
Admiral
's
daughter
should
contrive
to
admit
us
to
the
Dockyard
that
night
,
when
all
was
quiet
,
in
order
that
we
might
institute
a
search
for
the
missing
German
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
just
before
half
-
past
eleven
,
we
halted
before
the
small
private
door
in
the
Dockyard
wall
,
used
by
the
Admiral
-
Superintendent
and
his
household
,
and
as
the
clock
struck
the
door
opened
,
revealing
Vera
.
<EOS>
Next
instant
we
were
within
the
forbidden
zone
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
was
frosty
and
a
good
deal
too
bright
to
suit
our
purpose
.
<EOS>
Vera
gave
some
instructions
to
her
lover
,
pointing
to
a
row
of
long
,
dark
sheds
with
sloping
roofs
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
Dockyard
,
saying
:
 
"
If
he
's
inside
,
he
's
almost
certain
to
be

<EOS>
But
be
careful
of
the
police
;
they
are
very
watchful
over
yonder
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
after
refastening
the
gate
she
disappeared
into
the
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
deep
shadows
we
both
crept
noiselessly
forward
,
negotiating
in
safety
a
pair
of
lock
-
gates
in
the
open
,
and
pursuing
our
way
until
in
the
vicinity
of
the
shed
which
the
Admiral
's
daughter
had
pointed
out
we
discovered
an
old
boiler
,
in
which
we
both
secreted
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
Hardly
had
we
crept
inside
when
we
heard
the
measured
tramp
of
a
policeman
,
who
passed
actually
within
a
few
feet
of
us
.
<EOS>
From
the
round
hole
in
which
we
lay
we
could
see
Gosport
--
a
pale
row
of
lamps
across
the
harbour
.
 
<EOS>
We
waited
there
,
scarcely
daring
to
whisper
,
until
at
last
the
clock
struck
one
.
<EOS>
If
Karff
was
in
the
vicinity
of
that
shed
beside
which
we
were
secreted
,
he
made
no
sign
.
<EOS>
All
was
silent
.
<EOS>
Once
the
shrill
siren
of
a
ship
out
at
Spithead
broke
the
quiet
.
<EOS>
Then
its
echoes
died
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
we
might
have
a
careful
look
round
,
"
Ray
suggested
after
a
long
silence
.
 
<EOS>
With
great
care
,
therefore
,
we
both
emerged
from
our
hiding
-
place
,
and
keeping
well
within
the
shadows
,
passed
round
shed
No
.
4
,
which
we
found
was
completely
closed
in
from
view
,
its
door
being
strongly
barred
and
padlocked
.
 
<EOS>
Unable
to
see
anything
,
we
decided
to
halt
in
the
darkness
behind
a
heap
of
scrap
-
iron
and
to
listen
for
any
sound
of
movement
.
 
<EOS>
The
cutting
wind
chilled
us
both
to
the
marrow
,
for
a
white
rime
had
gathered
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
The
only
sound
we
heard
was
that
of
the
measured
footsteps
of
another
constable
,
which
advanced
and
then
died
away
again
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
however
,
no
sign
of
the
German
spy
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
get
in
by
the
door
yonder
would
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
he
would
try
the
roof
,
"
my
companion
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
right
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
remain
down
here
and
watch
while
I
try
and
get
up
above
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
I
left
him
,
and
after
considerable
difficulty
succeeded
in
gaining
the
roof
of
the
shed
adjoining
,
crouching
in
the
gutter
between
the
sloping
roofs
of
the
two
sheds
.
 
<EOS>
On
each
side
of
me
sloped
upwards
skylights
which
lighted
the
interiors
of
the
building
-
sheds
,
but
all
were
thickly
coated
with
a
composition
of
dockyard
dust
and
soot
,
which
had
been
poured
forth
from
many
a
warship
's
funnel
as
well
as
from
the
dozens
of
furnaces
around
.
<EOS>
All
was
dark
below
;
therefore
I
could
see
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
been
in
my
elevated
position
for
fully
twenty
minutes
before
I
was
prompted
to
creep
along
to
the
further
end
of
the
gulley
,
<EOS>
where
,
to
my
surprise
,
I
saw
that
close
to
where
I
stood
two
panes
of
glass
had
been
neatly
removed
and
laid
aside
.
 
<EOS>
Through
the
hole
I
gazed
down
into
the
interior
of
the
shed
,
when
I
was
startled
to
see
the
small
glow
of
an
electric
lamp
in
the
hand
of
the
man
of
whom
we
were
in
search
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
standing
beside
the
long
,
spindle
-
shaped
hull
of
a
new
submarine
boat
which
lay
on
a
very
elevated
set
of
stocks
on
the
far
side
of
the
shed
.
<EOS>
Another
boat
similar
,
but
not
so
nearly
complete
,
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
dock
alongside
her
.
 
<EOS>
As
Karff
with
his
electric
lamp
moved
slowly
and
noiselessly
along
,
carefully
examining
England
's
newest
submarine
,
which
rumour
had
said
was
the
most
silent
and
perfect
craft
of
its
kind
<EOS>
,
I
was
able
to
make
out
vaguely
that
,
differing
considerably
from
photographs
of
other
submarines
I
had
seen
,
the
boat
on
the
elevated
stocks
had
a
bow
which
ran
out
into
a
kind
of
snout
,
while
instead
of
<EOS>
the
usual
small
circular
or
oval
conning
-
tower
<EOS>
she
had
what
looked
like
a
long
,
narrow
superstructure
running
along
the
greater
part
of
her
length
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
much
higher
forward
than
aft
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
,
too
,
to
have
a
great
number
of
propellers
.
 
<EOS>
I
watched
the
man
Karff
making
some
rapid
memoranda
,
and
so
occupied
was
he
with
his
work
that
he
never
looked
upward
.
<EOS>
Had
he
done
so
,
he
would
certainly
have
detected
my
head
against
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
manner
which
showed
him
to
be
fully
acquainted
with
the
construction
of
submarine
vessels
,
he
moved
to
and
fro
,
examining
both
boats
.
<EOS>
Then
,
after
about
half
an
hour
's
minute
investigation
,
he
seated
himself
upon
a
bench
and
with
his
little
lamp
shaded
to
throw
no
reflection
he
took
out
a
piece
of
paper
and
leisurely
made
a
rough
sketch
of
England
's
newest
war
-
craft
,
both
side
and
horizontal
views
.
 
<EOS>
Leaving
him
thus
occupied
,
I
descended
to
Ray
,
and
finding
him
secreted
near
the
water
's
edge
,
described
what
I
had
discovered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
"
<EOS>
So
I
was
not
mistaken
in
that
cryptogram
after
all
!
<EOS>
We
will
allow
the
fellow
to
complete
his
work
and
then
compel
him
to
disgorge
his
notes
.
<EOS>
They
will
furnish
us
with
very
excellent
evidence
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
we
waited
,
keeping
our
eyes
fixed
upon
the
spot
where
he
must
descend
,
and
hardly
daring
to
breathe
lest
we
should
prematurely
alarm
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
Dockyard
clock
chimed
three
,
but
the
spy
had
not
emerged
.
<EOS>
After
another
half
-
hour
of
watchful
silence
I
saw
that
Ray
began
to
be
anxious
.
<EOS>
At
last
the
bell
rang
out
four
,
and
scarcely
had
the
last
sound
died
away
when
we
were
startled
by
a
splash
near
us
,
and
next
moment
discerned
a
man
in
white
shirtsleeves
swimming
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
!
<EOS>
That
's
him
!
<EOS>
"
I
gasped
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
cut
a
way
out
of
the
side
of
the
shed
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
next
moment
a
boat
shot
forth
from
the
darkness
pulled
by
a
woman
who
had
apparently
been
waiting
close
by
.
<EOS>
The
woman
was
Vera
!
 
<EOS>
In
a
moment
we
were
both
down
the
steps
and
pulling
in
the
boat
towards
the
swimming
man
,
who
,
we
saw
,
was
being
rapidly
approached
by
a
second
boat
which
had
also
been
in
waiting
until
the
chiming
of
the
clock
.
 
<EOS>
The
spy
was
exerting
every
muscle
to
reach
the
boat
,
but
we
soon
overtook
him
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
called
upon
him
in
German
to
surrender
,
but
he
refused
,
and
kept
on
.
<EOS>
Quickly
,
however
,
we
cut
him
off
from
the
boat
which
he
was
trying
to
reach
,
while
the
rower
,
seeing
the
discovery
of
his
friend
,
pulled
away
into
the
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
For
some
time
the
spy
struggled
on
,
but
at
last
,
abandoned
and
exhausted
,
he
was
compelled
to
obey
us
and
come
aboard
in
order
to
save
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
Half
dead
and
helpless
he
submitted
to
our
search
,
<EOS>
when
in
his
belt
,
preserved
in
an
oilskin
pocket
,
we
discovered
the
memoranda
and
the
drawing
which
I
had
seen
him
prepare
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
,
sullen
and
half
drowned
,
refused
to
make
any
statement
,
though
he
could
speak
English
well
and
write
it
perfectly
,
as
shown
by
the
note
on
his
plan
of
the
new
boat
;
therefore
we
landed
him
at
the
Stony
Steps
across
at
Gosport
.
<EOS>
Before
we
left
him
we
gave
him
to
understand
that
if
he
did
not
at
once
leave
the
country
he
would
be
arrested
.
<EOS>
Yet
so
absurd
is
our
law
that
I
doubt
whether
we
could
have
given
him
in
charge
even
though
we
had
wished
!

<EOS>
"
This
boat
would
appear
to
me
to
be
of
about
700
tons
     
displacement
when
complete
,
possibly
rather
over
.
<EOS>
She
is
,
as
     
far
as
I
am
able
to
measure
,
about
180
feet
long
with
an
     
extreme
beam
a
little
forward
of
amidships
of
20
feet
.
<EOS>
She
is
     
fitted
with
three
propeller
shafts
with
three
small
four
-
bladed
     
propellers
on
each
.
<EOS>
As
she
is
provided
with
what
appear
to
me
     
to
be
some
kind
of
turbine
engines
,
I
imagine
that
the
centre
     
shaft
is
for
going
astern
only
.
<EOS>
The
propellers
on
this
shaft
     
seem
to
be
attached
in
such
a
way
that
they
could
be
     
'
feathered
'
by
suitable
gearing
on
board
so
as
not
to
retard
     
the
vessel
's
way
when
going
ahead
.
<EOS>
The
engines
of
this
boat
are
     
of
a
type
which
I
have
never
before
seen
.
<EOS>
I
imagine
that
they
     
are
a
combination
of
the
new
'
gas
-
producer
'
engine
and
the
     
turbine
system
,
the
explosion
of
the
combined
gas
and
air
     
being
split
up
and
passing
into
the
turbine
through
a
number
     
of
different
channels
simultaneously
.
<EOS>
This
would
be
a
very
     
economical
system
if
the
necessary
power
can
be
obtained
,
     
and
would
be
much
safer
for
use
below
than
petrol
engines
.
      
<EOS>
"
The
boat
is
evidently
intended
to
operate
a
good
deal
in
an
     
'
awash
'
position
,
for
there
is
fairly
thick
armour
-
plating
over
     
the
greater
part
of
the
upper
side
of
the
bow
,
while
the
fore
     
end
of
the
superstructure
is
made
of
two
6-inch
Krupp
steel
     
plates
meeting
at
an
acute
angle
,
and
so
forming
a
kind
of
stem
     
when
the
boat
is
moving
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
The
space
enclosed
between
     
these
two
plates
is
evidently
intended
to
be
used
as
the
     
conning
-
tower
.
<EOS>
Here
there
are
a
periscope
,
steering
-
wheel
,
     
voice
-
tubes
,
and
everything
necessary
for
the
control
of
the
     
vessel
.
<EOS>
There
are
two
horizontal
propellers
or
fans
,
which
seem
     
to
be
driven
by
electricity
derived
from
an
installation
of
     
accumulators
,
and
which
are
certainly
intended
to
secure
     
horizontal
immersion
,
so
the
vessel
will
not
plunge
or
dive
,
     
but
immerse
herself
horizontally
by
means
of
these
propellers
,
     
which
,
by
the
way
,
work
in
vertical
shafts
running
completely
     
through
the
boat
,
one
forward
and
the
other
aft
,
as
was
the
     
case
in
the
_
Nordenfeldt
_
,
_
Waddington
_
,
and
other
early
     
submarines
.
      
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Forward
there
is
an
air
-
lock
and
diving
-
chamber
,
as
in
the
     
'
Lake
'
boats
,
so
that
divers
can
get
in
and
out
of
the
vessel
     
<EOS>
whilst
under
water
.
<EOS>
It
would
also
afford
a
means
of
escape
for
     
the
crew
in
the
case
of
accident
.
<EOS>
This
is
further
provided
for
     
by
a
detachable
boat
or
caisson
at
the
after
end
of
the
     
superstructure
capable
of
holding
ten
men
,
I
should
say
,
or
     
possibly
a
dozen
.
<EOS>
There
are
also
appliances
which
I
suppose
are
     
telephone
buoys
for
communicating
with
the
surface
.
<EOS>
There
are
     
six
torpedo
tubes
fitted
,
one
forward
,
one
aft
,
and
the
others
     
two
on
either
broadside
.
<EOS>
And
there
seems
to
be
provision
for
     
six
other
torpedoes
of
the
18-inch
type
.
      
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
long
rudder
for
ordinary
steering
,
and
four
     
horizontal
ones
or
planes
which
are
placed
abreast
the
     
horizontal
screws
and
which
,
I
imagine
,
act
automatically
in
     
conjunction
with
them
,
as
they
seem
to
gear
up
with
the
shafts
     
for
these
propellers
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
big
safety
detachable
weight
     
which
fits
loosely
into
a
recess
amidships
,
and
four
broad
     
wheels
with
ball
bearings
which
do
not
fold
up
as
in
the
'
Lake
'
     
boats
,
but
always
protrude
nearly
half
their
diameter
.
<EOS>
After
     
all
they
would
not
obstruct
her
way
when
water
-
borne
more
than
     
a
keel
--
or
very
little
more
.
<EOS>
They
are
quite
independent
and
     
unconnected
with
the
interior
of
the
vessel
,
which
while
     
resting
on
them
would
receive
forward
impetus
from
her
     
propellers
.
<EOS>
In
the
'
awash
'
position
she
would
offer
a
very
     
small
and
almost
invulnerable
target
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
I
said
,
marvelling
at
what
we
had
translated
.
<EOS>
"
What
induced
you
to
believe
that
the
cryptogram
had
any
reference
to
the
new
submarine
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Those
figures
'
6.11
'
puzzled
me
greatly
,
"
he
replied
;
"
but
at
last
I
deciphered
them
as
'
F.
2'--F
being
the
sixth
letter
of
the
alphabet
--
the
number
of
our
newest
and
most
formidable
submarine
,
which
was
being
kept
such
a
strict
secret
by
the
Admiralty
.
'
<EOS>
Royal
Pier
'
is
the
name
of
the
hotel
in
which
Steinheim
stayed
at
Southsea
,
and
18
<EOS>
the
number
of
his
room
.
<EOS>
From
facts
I
elucidated
,
it
was
made
plain
that
Max
Steinheim
was
about
to
embark
upon
the
investigation
,
being
in
secret
communication
with
Hartmann
,
and
was
to
meet
Karff
at
Charing
Cross
Station
.
<EOS>
This
Steinheim
had
already
,
by
an
ingenious
device
,
secured
from
a
private
of
engineers
named
James
Ward
--
whom
I
have
seen
--
certain
information
regarding
the
new
boom
defences
of
Portsmouth
Harbour
.
<EOS>
Ward
,
whose
home
is
at
Great
Weldon
,
suddenly
discovered
to
his
horror
that
the
man
was
a
German
spy
,
followed
him
to
Guildford
,
attacked
him
in
the
train
,
and
left
him
for
dead
.
<EOS>
For
that
reason
Steinheim
has
refused
to
make
any
statement
to
the
police
.
<EOS>
When
I
saw
Ward
a
week
ago
,
he
explained
how
innocently
he
had
fallen
into
the
trap
which
the
cunning
Steinheim
had
laid
for
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
evidence
you
have
here
in
black
and
white
will
surely
prove
convincing
,
"
I
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
go
and
see
Steinheim
again
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
He
is
still
in
the
hospital
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
We
shall
remain
silent
.
<EOS>
To
show
our
hand
will
only
place
Hartmann
on
the
alert
.
<EOS>
To
do
that
is
needless
.
<EOS>
We
have
prevented
the
plan
of
our
new
submarine
going
to
Germany
,
and
for
the
present
that
is
sufficient
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
my
friend
drew
up
the
blind
and
gazed
out
upon
the
rosy
dawn
across
the
water
.

CHAPTER
III
 
<EOS>
THE
BACK
-
DOOR
OF
ENGLAND
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
that
's
rather
curious
,
"
I
remarked
,
closing
the
door
of
the
old
oak
-
panelled
smoking
-
room
at
Metfield
Park
,
and
returning
to
where
my
friend
Ray
Raymond
was
seated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Was
anyone
outside
the
door
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
quickly
on
the
alert
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Hill
-
Mason
's
German
maid
.
<EOS>
You
remember
,
Vera
pointed
her
out
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
H'm
!
<EOS>
and
she
was
listening
--
after
every
one
else
has
gone
to
bed
!
"
<EOS>
he
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Jack
,
it
's
curious
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
past
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Two
months
had
passed
since
the
affair
down
at
Portsmouth
,
but
we
had
not
been
inactive
.
<EOS>
We
were
sitting
before
the
great
open
fireplace
where
the
logs
were
blazing
,
after
the
rest
of
the
men
had
taken
their
candles
and
retired
,
and
had
been
exchanging
confidences
in
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
the
door
remained
ajar
.
<EOS>
I
had
,
however
,
detected
the
_
frou
-
frou
_
of
a
woman
's
skirt
,
and
creeping
across
to
the
door
had
seen
the
maid
of
one
of
the
guests
disappearing
down
the
stone
passage
which
led
to
the
great
hall
now
in
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
Metfield
Park
,
three
miles
from
Melton
Constable
,
in
Norfolk
,
the
seat
of
the
Jocelyns
,
was
a
fine
old
Tudor
place
in
the
centre
of
a
splendid
park
,
where
the
pheasant
shooting
was
always
excellent
.
<EOS>
Harry
Jocelyn
,
the
heir
,
had
been
with
us
at
Balliol
,
hence
Ray
and
I
usually
received
invitations
to
the
shooting
parties
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
,
however
,
Vera
Vallance
with
her
aunt
,
Mrs.
Mortimer
,
had
been
invited
,
much
to
Ray
's
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
party
was
a
well
-
known
naval
officer
,
captain
of
a
first
-
class
cruiser
,
two
military
officers
,
and
several
smart
women
,
for
both
Sir
Herbert
and
Lady
Jocelyn
moved
in
a
very
smart
set
.
<EOS>
Several
of
the
ladies
had
joined
us
in
the
smoking
-
room
for
cigarettes
,
and
the
conversation
around
the
fire
had
been
mainly
the
usual
society
chatter
,
until
at
one
o'clock
every
one
had
left
for
bed
except
our
two
selves
.
 
<EOS>
Over
the
great
fireplace
were
the
arms
of
the
Jocelyns
carved
in
stone
,
with
the
date
1573
,
and
in
the
corner
near
the
window
was
a
stand
of
armour
upon
which
the
dancing
flames
glinted
ever
and
anon
.
<EOS>
Through
the
long
uncurtained
window
shone
the
bright
moon
from
over
the
park
,
and
just
as
I
reseated
myself
the
stable
clock
chimed
the
half
-
hour
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
been
there
four
days
,
and
the
sport
had
been
excellent
.
<EOS>
On
the
previous
day
Ray
had
excused
himself
on
account
of
the
bad
weather
,
and
had
spent
the
hours
mostly
with
Vera
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
of
how
he
had
employed
his
time
that
he
had
been
telling
me
when
I
had
discovered
the
eavesdropper
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
why
our
conversation
should
prove
so
interesting
to
that
maid
?
"
<EOS>
he
remarked
thoughtfully
,
gazing
into
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
rather
good
-
looking
for
a
German
,
is
n't
she
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
who
is
this
Mrs.
Hill
-
Mason
?
<EOS>
She
seems
a
rather
loud
and
buxom
person
,
fond
of
the
display
of
jewellery
,
dark
,
somewhat
oleaginous
,
and
devoted
to
bridge
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Harry
says
his
mother
met
her
in
Cairo
last
winter
.
<EOS>
She
's
one
of
the
Somerset
Masons
--
half
-
sister
to
the
Countess
of
Thanet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
she
is
known
,
then
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
get
Vera
to
make
some
inquiry
to
-
morrow
as
to
where
she
obtained
her
maid
,
"
declared
Ray
.
<EOS>
"
The
woman
is
interested
in
us
,
and
we
must
discover
the
cause
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
somehow
mistrust
her
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
met
her
crossing
the
hall
just
before
dinner
,
and
I
detected
a
curious
look
in
her
eyes
as
she
glanced
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Merely
your
fancy
,
Jack
,
old
chap
--
because
she
's
German
,
"
he
laughed
,
stretching
his
long
legs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
what
you
were
telling
me
about
Vera
and
her
discovery
has
alarmed
me
,
"
I
said
,
tossing
away
the
end
of
my
cigar
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
she
only
returned
last
week
from
Emden
,
where
she
's
been
visiting
her
old
German
governess
,
who
,
it
seems
,
is
now
married
to
an
official
in
the
construction
department
of
the
German
Admiralty
.
<EOS>
From
her
friend
she
was
able
to
learn
a
lot
,
which
will
,
no
doubt
,
cause
<EOS>
our
Lords
of
the
Admiralty
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
would
the
British
public
think
if
they
were
told
the
truth
--
that
Germany
is
rapidly
building
a
secret
fleet
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
fellow
,
the
public
would
simply
say
you
were
a
liar
,
"
he
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Every
Englishman
fancies
himself
top
-
dog
,
even
though
British
diplomacy
--
apart
from
that
of
our
excellent
King
--
is
the
laughing
-
stock
of
the
Powers
.
<EOS>
No
,
"
he
added
,
"
the
truth
is
out
.
<EOS>
All
yesterday
I
spent
with
Vera
,
preparing
the
information
which
she
forwarded
to
the
Admiralty
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
I
registered
the
letter
for
her
at
the
village
post
office
.
<EOS>
The
authorities
owe
her
a
very
deep
debt
for
succeeding
in
obtaining
the
information
which
our
secret
service
has
always
failed
to
get
.
<EOS>
She
,
an
admiral
's
daughter
,
is
now
able
to
furnish
actual
details
of
the
ships
now
building
in
secret
and
where
they
are
being
constructed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
matter
which
will
,
no
doubt
,
be
considered
very
seriously
by
the
Government
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
suppose
they
treat
the
whole
thing
lightly
,
as
they
always
do
.
<EOS>
We
invite
invasion
,
"
he
sighed
as
he
rose
,
adding
:
"
Let
's
turn
in
now
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
we
'll
keep
an
eye
upon
that
unusually
inquisitive
maid
.
"
 
<EOS>
That
night
the
eyes
of
the
German
maid
haunted
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
rid
myself
of
their
recollection
.
<EOS>
Was
it
that
this
hunting
down
of
German
spies
was
getting
on
my
nerves
?
 
<EOS>
Next
day
we
were
shooting
Starlings
Wood
,
about
five
miles
distant
,
but
Ray
having
"
cried
off
"
one
day
,
could
not
do
so
again
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
at
his
suggestion
,
I
made
an
excuse
and
remained
at
home
with
the
ladies
.
<EOS>
The
morning
I
spent
walking
through
the
park
with
Vera
,
a
smart
,
sweet
-
faced
little
figure
in
her
short
tweed
skirt
and
furs
,
with
her
bright
and
vivacious
chatter
.
<EOS>
From
her
I
learnt
some
further
details
concerning
her
visit
to
Emden
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ray
is
most
excited
about
it
,
Mr.
Jacox
,
"
she
was
saying
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
I
had
to
make
my
inquiries
with
great
caution
and
discretion
,
but
I
managed
to
find
out
what
I
wanted
,
and
I
sent
all
the
details
to
the
Admiralty
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
 
Then
as
we
went
along
the
wide
beech
avenue
I
told
her
of
the
curious
incident
in
the
smoking
-
room
on
the
previous
evening
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ray
was
telling
me
about
it
just
before
breakfast
,
"
she
said
,
turning
her
splendid
eyes
to
mine
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
made
some
inquiries
of
Mrs.
Hill
-
Mason
,
and
it
appears
that
the
maid
Erna
Stolberg
was
recommended
to
her
by
a
friend
when
she
was
in
Dresden
last
year
.
<EOS>
She
's
a
most
exemplary
person
,
and
has
a
number
of
friends
in
England
.
<EOS>
She
was
previously
with
a
French
_
baronne
_
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Hill
-
Mason
often
moves
in
a
military
set
,
does
n't
she
?
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Somebody
last
night
stated
that
she
's
the
widow
of
a
general
,
and
is
well
known
down
at
Aldershot
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
Mrs.
Hill
-
Mason
visits
at
the
houses
of
military
officers
,
as
it
seems
she
does
,
then
this
inquisitive
maid
would
be
afforded
many
opportunities
for
gathering
information
.
<EOS>
I
intend
to
watch
her
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
will
I
,
Mr.
Jacox
,
"
replied
the
admiral
's
daughter
,
drawing
her
astrachan
collar
tighter
about
her
throat
.
 
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
later
we
drove
in
the
wagonette
out
to
the
shooting
-
party
in
the
woods
,
where
a
merry
luncheon
was
served
in
a
marquee
.
<EOS>
I
,
however
,
returned
to
the
house
before
the
rest
of
the
party
and
haunted
the
servants
'
hall
.
<EOS>
With
Williams
the
butler
I
was
on
friendly
terms
,
and
finding
him
in
the
great
hall
,
began
to
make
inquiries
regarding
the
guests
'
servants
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
got
a
German
woman
among
them
,
have
n't
you
?
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
was
his
reply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
rather
funny
one
she
is
,
<EOS>
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
She
goes
out
alone
for
walks
after
she
's
dressed
her
mistress
for
dinner
,
and
is
out
sometimes
till
quite
late
.
<EOS>
What
she
does
wandering
about
in
the
dark
nobody
knows
.
<EOS>
But
it
ai
n't
for
me
to
say
a
word
,
sir
<EOS>
;
she
's
a
visitor
's
maid
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
held
my
own
counsel
,
but
resolved
to
watch
.
 
<EOS>
Tea
in
the
great
hall
,
over
which
Lady
Jocelyn
presided
,
proved
the
usual
irresponsible
function
,
but
when
I
went
to
my
room
to
dress
for
dinner
<EOS>
I
became
convinced
that
certain
papers
in
my
suit
-
case
had
been
turned
over
and
investigated
.
 
<EOS>
That
night
I
did
not
go
in
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
I
heard
the
gong
sound
,
and
when
the
company
had
gone
in
,
I
put
on
thick
boots
,
overcoat
,
and
cap
,
and
passed
through
the
back
way
along
the
old
wing
of
the
house
,
through
the
smoking
-
room
,
and
out
upon
the
drive
.
 
<EOS>
Behind
some
holly
bushes
where
I
could
see
any
one
leave
by
the
great
paved
courtyard
where
the
servants
'
entrance
was
situated
,
I
concealed
myself
and
waited
in
patience
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
dark
and
overcast
.
<EOS>
The
stable
chimes
had
rung
out
half
-
past
eight
,
but
I
still
remained
until
,
about
twenty
minutes
later
,
footfalls
sounded
,
and
from
out
the
arched
entrance
to
the
courtyard
came
a
female
figure
in
a
close
-
fitting
hat
and
long
dark
ulster
.
 
<EOS>
She
passed
close
by
me
,
under
the
light
of
the
lamp
,
and
I
saw
it
was
the
fair
-
haired
woman
for
whom
I
was
waiting
.
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
walking
straight
down
the
avenue
to
the
lodge
-
gates
,
she
struck
along
a
footpath
which
led
for
a
mile
across
the
park
,
first
skirting
the
lake
--
the
fishpond
of
the
monks
who
lived
there
before
the
Dissolution
;
then
,
passing
under
the
dark
shadow
of
a
spinney
,
led
to
a
stile
by
which
the
high
park
wall
could
be
negotiated
and
the
main
road
to
East
Dereham
reached
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
went
forward
so
I
followed
.
<EOS>
I
knew
the
path
well
.
<EOS>
I
watched
her
ascend
the
stile
and
cross
the
wall
into
the
road
.
<EOS>
Then
I
crept
up
and
peered
over
into
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
She
had
turned
to
the
right
,
and
I
could
discern
her
waiting
at
the
roadside
about
thirty
yards
away
.
 
<EOS>
From
my
place
of
concealment
<EOS>
I
could
hear
her
slow
footsteps
as
she
idled
up
and
down
in
the
darkness
,
evidently
waiting
for
some
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
about
ten
minutes
passed
when
I
heard
the
whir
of
a
motor
-
car
approaching
,
<EOS>
its
big
glaring
headlamps
shedding
a
stream
of
white
brilliance
over
the
muddy
road
.
<EOS>
As
it
approached
her
it
slowed
down
and
stopped
.
<EOS>
Then
I
distinguished
it
to
be
a
big
Limousine
,
the
occupant
of
which
opened
the
door
,
and
she
entered
with
a
word
of
greeting
.
 
<EOS>
I
stood
peering
into
the
darkness
,
in
surprise
and
disappointment
at
not
catching
sight
of
the
person
with
whom
she
was
keeping
these
nightly
appointments
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
door
had
banged
the
driver
drove
across
the
road
,
backed
,
and
turning
,
sped
away
in
the
direction
he
had
come
.
 
<EOS>
But
while
he
was
turning
I
had
gained
the
road
,
advancing
beneath
the
hedgerow
in
an
endeavour
to
see
the
number
of
the
car
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
baffled
.
<EOS>
It
was
covered
with
mud
.
 
<EOS>
Afterwards
,
much
disappointed
,
and
certainly
hungry
,
I
made
my
way
back
across
the
park
to
the
Hall
,
where
,
after
managing
to
get
a
snack
from
Williams
,
I
joined
the
party
at
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
That
night
the
woman
Stolberg
returned
at
five
minutes
to
eleven
,
and
later
,
when
Ray
went
upstairs
with
me
,
I
described
what
I
had
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Next
night
,
instead
of
following
her
out
,
I
waited
at
the
spot
at
half
-
past
ten
,
when
,
sure
enough
,
the
car
returned
ten
minutes
later
and
deposited
her
.
<EOS>
The
number
plates
,
however
,
were
obliterated
by
the
mud
both
front
and
back
--
purposely
it
seemed
to
me
.
<EOS>
The
man
within
shook
her
hand
as
she
alighted
,
but
I
could
not
see
his
face
.
<EOS>
Was
he
some
secret
lover
?
<EOS>
Apparently
she
went
no
great
distance
each
evening
,
going
and
coming
from
the
direction
of
Holt
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
I
took
several
opportunities
of
watching
the
woman
at
close
quarters
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
peculiarly
set
,
very
close
together
,
her
lips
were
thin
,
and
her
cheek
-
bones
rather
high
.
<EOS>
Otherwise
she
was
not
bad
-
looking
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hill
-
Mason
had
,
of
course
,
no
idea
of
her
maid
's
nocturnal
motor
-
rides
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
the
woman
had
any
suspicion
that
she
was
being
watched
I
know
not
;
but
on
the
next
night
when
Ray
took
a
turn
at
keeping
an
eye
upon
her
,
she
did
not
go
out
,
but
on
the
next
she
went
,
and
Ray
followed
her
to
the
park
wall
,
but
saw
nothing
more
than
I
had
done
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
of
course
,
Vera
was
greatly
interested
in
the
result
of
our
observations
.
<EOS>
Through
her
own
maid
,
Batson
,
she
discovered
the
room
occupied
by
the
German
,
and
to
this
I
made
my
way
,
at
considerable
risk
,
one
morning
while
the
maid
was
busy
attending
upon
her
mistress
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
good
look
through
her
belongings
,
finding
in
her
trunk
a
small
,
flat
tin
box
,
japanned
dark
green
,
strong
,
and
secured
by
a
lock
of
well
-
known
make
.
<EOS>
What
,
I
wondered
,
did
it
contain
?
 
<EOS>
Could
I
have
but
seen
the
number
of
the
mysterious
car
<EOS>
I
could
have
discovered
the
identity
of
her
nocturnal
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
day
that
I
discovered
the
tin
box
in
her
trunk
,
Mrs.
Hill
-
Mason
,
however
,
returned
to
London
,
taking
with
her
the
mysterious
Fraeulein
.
 
<EOS>
Three
days
more
went
by
,
and
I
was
about
to
dismiss
the
affair
as
a
combination
of
curious
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Vera
and
her
aunt
had
left
to
pay
a
visit
in
Worcestershire
,
and
Ray
<EOS>
I
were
due
to
go
up
to
town
that
morning
,
when
he
entered
my
room
,
saying
abruptly
:
 
"
I
'm
not
going
to
London
yet
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
over
to
Cromer
instead
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Cromer
!
<EOS>
"
I
echoed
.
<EOS>
"
Hardly
the
time
of
year
for
the
seaside
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
That
same
grey
chilly
afternoon
,
in
the
grey
falling
light
,
we
sat
upon
one
of
the
seats
of
the
pier
at
Cromer
gazing
seaward
,
towards
where
the
German
coast
lay
beyond
the
indistinct
horizon
.
<EOS>
The
place
was
deserted
save
for
ourselves
.
<EOS>
On
the
cliff
behind
us
stood
the
long
red
facade
and
many
gables
of
the
Hotel
de
Paris
,
where
we
had
put
up
,
while
in
the
background
rose
the
square
old
church
tower
,
the
landmark
of
mariners
from
Haisborough
Gat
to
the
Dowsing
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
just
a
chance
of
us
falling
upon
something
interesting
about
here
,
"
Ray
was
saying
,
as
he
pressed
the
tobacco
into
his
pipe
,
and
by
the
expression
upon
his
keen
clean
-
shaven
face
I
saw
that
he
had
scented
the
presence
of
spies
.
"
<EOS>
Has
it
never
struck
you
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
that
the
east
coast
,
where
we
now
are
is
the
most
vulnerable
spot
in
England
,
and
the
first
objective
of
the
Kaiser
's
army
?
<EOS>
Every
soldier
and
sailor
in
Germany
dreams
of
'
the
Day'--the
day
when
he
will
set
foot
upon
this
shore
.
<EOS>
For
some
years
past
our
Intelligence
Department
has
known
of
the
German
plans
for
our
invasion
.
<EOS>
There
are
several
,
but
in
each
one
a
dash
,
and
a
surprise
landing
along
this
coast
of
Norfolk
and
of
Suffolk
and
Essex
is
the
first
step
.
<EOS>
Knowledge
of
this
prompted
Lord
Roberts
to
resign
his
seat
on
the
National
Defence
Committee
and
make
those
stirring
speeches
pointing
out
our
country
's
peril
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
thanks
did
the
country
give
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
interrupted
.
<EOS>
"
People
only
laugh
at
him
for
his
trouble
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
my
friend
bitterly
,
"
the
public
are
ignorant
,
therefore
they
do
not
heed
.
<EOS>
They
talk
glibly
about
the
strength
of
our
navy
,
forgetful
that
the
German
diplomacy
is
the
cleverest
and
most
cunning
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
When
'
the
Day
'
dawns
there
will
be
no
suspicion
of
war
,
and
certainly
no
declaration
of
hostilities
.
<EOS>
Before
we
have
realised
that
war
is
in
the
air
,
the
enemy
will
have
their
feet
firmly
planted
upon
British
soil
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
if
the
enemy
intend
landing
along
this
shore
,
it
is
certain
that
spies
are
active
here
,
gathering
all
information
likely
to
be
of
service
to
the
invader
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
exactly
why
I
've
come
here
,
my
dear
Jack
,
"
my
friend
said
.
<EOS>
"
We
know
that
our
eastern
counties
have
been
divided
into
districts
by
the
Germans
,
and
in
each
one
or
more
secret
agents
are
busily
at
work
taking
notes
of
food
supplies
,
forage
,
blacksmiths
'
shops
,
motor
-
cars
for
transport
,
the
destruction
of
telegraphs
and
telephones
,
positions
for
artillery
,
and
the
best
mode
of
advance
south
to
London
.
<EOS>
One
may
rest
assured
that
the
ordnance
map
is
being
very
much
amplified
just
now
.
"
 
<EOS>
That
evening
we
spent
idly
in
the
hotel
,
and
next
day
,
hiring
a
motor
-
car
<EOS>
,
we
drove
through
Runton
to
Sheringham
and
over
the
hills
three
miles
further
towards
the
back
-
door
of
England
--
<EOS>
the
place
neglected
by
those
responsible
for
our
defences
,
and
by
the
public
alike
--
Weybourne
.
 
<EOS>
The
road
from
Sheringham
ran
down
a
steep
hill
,
called
the
Fox
Hill
,
to
the
little
village
that
lay
cosily
at
some
distance
from
the
sea
.
<EOS>
Passing
the
church
we
turned
sharply
to
the
right
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
found
ourselves
against
a
large
front
with
a
wide
open
beach
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
Having
alighted
,
we
walked
along
beside
the
surf
for
some
distance
,
out
of
hearing
of
our
chauffeur
,
when
my
friend
exclaimed
:
 
<EOS>
"
Here
is
one
of
the
spots
which
the
Germans
have
chosen
for
landing
.
<EOS>
Look
at
it
!
<EOS>
Everything
is
in
favour
of
a
hostile
force
.
<EOS>
That
range
of
hills
we
've
just
come
over
at
the
back
would
be
occupied
by
the
landing
force
at
once
,
and
thus
they
would
command
the
whole
country
from
Kelling
,
which
you
see
to
the
right
,
away
south
beyond
Cromer
,
down
to
Baxton
beyond
Mundesley
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
my
back
to
the
long
rolling
breakers
I
gazed
away
landward
at
the
long
line
of
hills
stretching
in
each
direction
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
indeed
,
an
ideal
spot
for
an
enemy
to
effect
a
landing
,
with
deep
water
right
up
to
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
of
the
confidence
we
have
in
our
fleet
and
our
wonderful
diplomacy
<EOS>
this
place
is
no
longer
watched
,
"
Raymond
remarked
,
standing
beside
me
muffled
in
his
motor
-
coat
,
for
the
wind
was
intensely
cold
.
"
<EOS>
Yet
in
days
gone
by
,
by
reason
of
the
facilities
which
nature
has
provided
for
the
landing
of
hostile
forces
,
it
was
carefully
guarded
whenever
the
invasion
of
England
was
believed
to
be
imminent
.
"
 
<EOS>
After
we
had
strolled
some
distance
along
the
beach
,
where
the
grey
-
green
waters
were
breaking
into
foam
,
my
friend
suddenly
halted
and
,
taking
a
piece
of
paper
from
his
pocket
,
stood
with
his
back
to
the
sea
and
made
a
sketch
of
the
irregular
contour
of
the
blue
hills
facing
him
from
the
coastguard
at
Salthouse
on
the
right
to
the
rising
ground
behind
Upper
Sheringham
on
the
left
--
the
positions
which
are
to
be
first
occupied
by
the
enemy
in
their
attack
upon
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
no
explanation
of
the
reason
of
his
action
,
therefore
I
stood
by
watching
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
we
returned
to
the
car
and
drove
inland
to
Weybourne
village
,
a
sleepy
old
-
world
little
place
from
which
the
sea
has
receded
.
<EOS>
As
we
turned
into
the
main
road
he
ordered
the
man
to
pull
up
,
and
,
descending
,
looked
about
him
,
first
at
the
lines
of
telegraph
-
wire
running
beside
the
road
,
and
then
we
both
strolled
through
the
village
.
<EOS>
My
companion
's
eyes
were
everywhere
.
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
be
making
mental
notes
of
every
feature
of
the
obscure
little
place
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
we
were
returning
to
the
car
he
suddenly
halted
,
saying
:
 
"
You
go
on
.
<EOS>
A
thought
has
just
occurred
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
turning
,
he
walked
back
to
the
small
village
post
office
situated
next
door
to
an
inn
,
and
was
absent
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
I
suspected
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
remarked
beneath
his
breath
as
he
rejoined
me
.
"
<EOS>
That
inn
is
kept
by
a
German
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
we
travelled
along
to
Cley
-
next
-
the
-
Sea
,
and
thence
by
way
of
Candlestick
Hill
and
through
the
wooded
country
around
Holt
,
back
to
Sheringham
,
where
we
lunched
at
the
"
Burlington
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
manner
had
changed
.
<EOS>
He
had
again
become
serious
and
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
A
cycling
map
of
the
district
which
he
had
bought
in
Cromer
that
morning
he
brought
out
,
and
as
we
sat
together
in
the
smoking
-
room
he
spread
it
upon
the
table
and
began
measuring
distances
with
a
slip
of
folded
paper
.
 
<EOS>
The
car
was
at
the
door
at
four
o'clock
,
and
we
were
in
the
act
of
moving
off
,
when
by
mere
chance
I
looked
up
at
the
second
floor
of
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
What
I
saw
caused
me
to
hold
my
breath
.
 
<EOS>
A
face
was
at
one
of
the
windows
watching
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
nudged
my
friend
,
and
cried
,
"
Look
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
when
he
raised
his
head
it
had
gone
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
white
face
had
only
showed
there
for
a
single
instant
,
yet
it
was
a
countenance
that
I
too
well
remembered
,
it
was
unmistakable
--
<EOS>
that
of
Fraeulein
Stolberg
!
 
<EOS>
I
told
Ray
as
we
whirled
along
into
the
town
.
<EOS>
But
he
only
grunted
in
surprise
,
and
remarked
that
we
were
going
to
Beccles
.
 
<EOS>
Why
was
that
woman
there
instead
of
being
with
her
mistress
,
who
,
we
had
ascertained
,
was
now
visiting
at
Cheltenham
?
 
<EOS>
Our
way
lay
first
back
to
Cromer
,
where
we
joined
the
direct
Norwich
road
by
way
of
Aylsham
,
but
about
four
miles
after
passing
Cromer
the
road
divided
.
<EOS>
The
left
-
hand
one
ran
to
our
destination
,
but
at
Ray
's
orders
we
took
the
right
-
hand
one
,
and
in
the
darkening
twilight
struck
across
a
wide
heath
,
which
I
afterwards
learnt
was
called
Roughton
Heath
,
until
we
passed
an
old
windmill
,
and
entered
the
small
crooked
village
of
Roughton
.
<EOS>
We
passed
beyond
the
place
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
and
then
descending
,
walked
forward
until
we
came
to
a
good
-
sized
,
comfortable
,
old
-
fashioned
house
,
probably
of
the
days
of
Queen
Anne
,
that
lay
behind
a
high
red
-
brick
wall
.
 
<EOS>
Through
the
iron
gates
I
noticed
,
as
we
paused
,
a
wide
lawn
in
front
,
with
steps
leading
up
to
a
portico
,
and
behind
a
large
orchard
and
meadow
.
<EOS>
The
blinds
were
already
down
,
but
in
several
of
the
windows
lights
showed
,
and
the
place
looked
well
kept
up
.
 
<EOS>
It
differed
but
little
from
hundreds
of
other
old
-
fashioned
houses
in
the
country
,
but
it
evidently
held
considerable
attraction
for
Ray
,
because
as
we
passed
beyond
the
gates
,
and
out
of
sight
of
any
one
in
the
house
,
he
took
out
his
electric
torch
and
carefully
examined
the
muddy
roadway
.
 
<EOS>
"
See
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
pointing
to
tracks
that
ran
in
and
out
of
the
gateway
.
<EOS>
"
The
car
's
home
is
here
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
car
?
<EOS>

The
car
which
used
to
meet
the
German
maid
at
Metfield
,
"
was
his
matter
-
of
-
fact
reply
.
<EOS>
"
For
the
present
we
know
sufficient
.
<EOS>
We
must
look
sharp
if
we
are
to
be
in
Beccles
before
eight
.
<EOS>
If
we
're
not
there
before
,
it
will
be
of
no
use
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
we
hurried
back
to
our
own
car
,
and
our
driver
,
by
taking
a
by
-
path
,
brought
us
out
upon
the
main
road
again
at
Thorpe
Market
,
and
just
after
half
-
past
seven
we
pulled
up
before
the
hotel
in
the
old
Suffolk
market
town
of
Beccles
,
under
the
shadow
of
the
stumpy
square
old
church
tower
.
 
<EOS>
The
car
was
garaged
,
and
after
a
drink
we
went
forth
for
a
walk
along
the
quiet
old
-
world
streets
,
until
suddenly
upon
a
corner
we
came
to
the
post
office
,
a
large
old
-
fashioned
two
-
storied
house
with
steep
tiled
roof
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wait
about
here
<EOS>
,
"
my
companion
said
;
"
a
dark
-
haired
man
in
a
light
grey
overcoat
and
golf
-
cap
will
probably
come
to
post
a
letter
just
before
eight
.
<EOS>
He
has
a
dark
brown
beard
,
and
usually
wears
a
white
muffler
.
<EOS>
When
he
comes
follow
him
,
and
see
where
he
goes
.
<EOS>
He
may
know
me
,
so
I
must
keep
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
lit
my
pipe
,
and
idled
up
and
down
,
keeping
the
letter
-
box
in
view
.
<EOS>
In
the
window
,
directly
above
it
,
was
a
clock
which
showed
it
then
to
be
a
quarter
to
eight
.
<EOS>
I
took
a
pretended
interest
in
the
small
shops
near
,
until
about
four
minutes
to
the
hour
<EOS>
a
closed
motor
-
car
swung
round
from
the
direction
of
the
Public
Hail
,
and
pulled
up
before
the
post
office
.
 
<EOS>
From
it
two
men
alighted
--
one
a
youngish
fair
-
haired
man
,
and
the
other
,
dark
-
bearded
and
much
older
,
wore
a
thick
grey
overcoat
and
a
white
muffler
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
man
of
whom
I
was
in
search
.
 
<EOS>
I
entered
the
office
directly
after
the
pair
,
on
pretence
of
buying
stamps
,
but
already
the
elder
of
the
two
had
handed
in
a
letter
to
be
registered
,
the
address
of
which
I
failed
to
discern
.
 
<EOS>
Both
seemed
to
be
in
a
great
hurry
,
for
as
soon
as
the
receipt
was
written
out
they
re
-
entered
the
car
and
drove
back
in
the
direction
they
had
come
,
leaving
me
standing
helpless
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
Immediately
I
returned
to
the
hotel
where
Ray
was
waiting
,
and
reported
to
him
,
whereupon
he
seized
his
hat
,
and
walking
with
me
back
to
the
post
office
halted
in
the
centre
of
the
road
examining
the
wheel
-
tracks
,
which
were
still
quite
plain
upon
the
damp
roadway
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
as
he
walked
back
,
he
said
:
 
"
Do
you
know
,
Jack
,
that
this
town
Beccles
has
been
decided
upon
by
the
Germans
as
the
head
-
quarters
of
the
Army
Corps
which
lands
at
Weybourne
?
<EOS>
It
's
a
natural
position
,
standing
upon
high
ground
and
commanding
the
whole
of
the
surrounding
country
.
<EOS>
Signals
made
from
that
church
tower
yonder
could
be
seen
very
far
afield
.
"
 
<EOS>
Then
,
as
we
sat
together
in
the
coffee
-
room
of
the
hotel
,
eating
a
hasty
meal
,
he
remarked
:
 
"
We
'll
go
back
to
Cromer
to
-
night
,
but
I
shall
go
to
town
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
You
'll
wait
till
my
return
,
wo
n't
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
So
I
was
left
alone
for
nearly
a
week
;
and
on
his
return
he
announced
that
we
must
at
once
shift
our
quarters
to
Lowestoft
.
<EOS>
So
south
we
went
that
same
night
,
arriving
at
midnight
,
and
putting
up
at
the
many
-
balconied
Empire
Hotel
.
 
<EOS>
The
town
interested
my
companion
not
at
all
,
but
from
there
we
went
forth
each
day
on
long
motor
excursions
,
scouring
the
whole
country
as
far
south
as
Aldborough
and
as
far
west
as
Bury
St.
Edmunds
.
<EOS>
All
the
roads
round
Southwold
,
Bungay
,
Saxmundham
,
Stow
Market
,
and
many
other
towns
we
reconnoitred
,
apparently
always
with
the
same
object
--
to
discover
wheel
-
tracks
of
a
mysterious
car
.
 
<EOS>
The
garages
of
every
town
Ray
visited
alone
,
but
his
inquiries
always
met
with
the
same
negative
result
.
 
<EOS>
Late
one
afternoon
,
however
,
when
on
the
road
between
Wymondham
and
Diss
,
he
suddenly
shouted
to
the
driver
to
stop
,
and
jumping
out
,
examined
the
track
of
wheels
.
<EOS>
The
road
,
however
,
was
hard
at
that
spot
,
and
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
decide
whether
the
car
had
travelled
north
or
south
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
've
gone
north
!
"
<EOS>
he
declared
with
satisfaction
;
therefore
we
continued
to
follow
them
towards
Wymondham
,
where
they
had
drawn
up
at
the
"
Old
Green
Dragon
,
"
and
gone
forth
again
,
striking
into
a
by
-
road
which
led
to
Bracon
Ash
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
when
he
saw
this
,
"
so
they
're
busy
at
work
<EOS>
--
that
's
plain
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
by
this
time
the
light
had
faded
,
and
much
to
our
chagrin
we
were
again
compelled
to
give
up
the
hunt
,
and
find
our
way
over
by
Hempnall
,
and
so
through
Bungay
back
to
Lowestoft
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
we
were
early
back
again
at
the
spot
,
but
heavy
rain
had
unfortunately
fallen
all
night
,
so
the
tracks
had
been
obliterated
.
 
<EOS>
After
another
week
of
unsuccessful
journeying
we
were
,
one
day
,
about
half
-
way
between
Norwich
going
towards
Aylsham
,
when
my
friend
's
keen
eyes
caught
sight
of
a
wheel
-
track
coming
out
of
a
narrow
by
-
road
.
 
<EOS>
We
halted
,
and
descending
<EOS>
he
examined
them
minutely
,
declaring
that
they
were
what
we
were
in
search
of
,
and
quite
fresh
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
considerably
excited
,
we
were
soon
upon
the
trail
,
following
the
car
through
Aylsham
and
North
Walsham
until
,
on
the
road
that
led
towards
the
sea
at
Happisburgh
,
it
suddenly
turned
into
another
byway
.
 
<EOS>
Here
Ray
decided
to
pull
up
and
follow
on
foot
,
which
we
did
for
nearly
two
miles
,
until
we
saw
before
us
the
railway
line
which
runs
between
North
Walsham
and
Yarmouth
.
<EOS>
We
had
left
the
road
,
for
there
,
pulled
up
before
us
,
was
the
car
I
had
seen
at
Beccles
,
and
on
ahead
were
the
two
men
,
one
of
whom
I
recognised
by
his
grey
coat
and
white
muffler
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
beneath
the
railway
bridge
,
carefully
examining
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
're
marking
that
down
on
their
plan
for
destruction
,
"
remarked
Ray
between
his
teeth
.
<EOS>
"
All
these
connections
will
be
destroyed
when
they
land
.
<EOS>
But
,
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
we
'll
be
even
with
them
yet
!
"
 
<EOS>
We
watched
them
in
secret
for
a
full
half
-
hour
,
as
they
examined
the
railroad
at
several
points
,
and
when
they
had
driven
off
we
followed
them
along
a
road
where
ran
six
lines
of
telegraph
into
Happisburgh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Those
wires
,
"
remarked
Ray
,
"
form
one
of
the
direct
cables
to
Germany
.
<EOS>
They
pass
through
Beccles
,
so
you
may
rest
assured
that
they
've
surveyed
it
well
!
"
 
<EOS>
At
Happisburgh
the
tracks
turned
to
the
left
,
and
thence
again
to
the
right
to
Walcot
,
but
just
as
we
were
passing
over
a
low
hill
we
saw
that
the
car
on
before
us
had
stopped
.
<EOS>
The
two
men
were
photographing
the
country
from
Paston
,
inland
towards
Witton
.
 
<EOS>
We
drew
up
and
watched
their
movements
.
 
<EOS>
Then
they
went
on
,
and
we
followed
,
parting
company
with
their
tracks
at
the
cross
-
roads
,
they
going
westward
,
while
we
struck
north
,
until
we
found
ourselves
once
again
in
Cromer
for
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
That
evening
we
made
an
amazing
discovery
at
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
Erna
Stolberg
was
staying
there
alone
under
the
name
of
Madame
Hirsch
!
<EOS>
Ray
first
saw
her
seated
in
the
reading
-
room
,
and
called
me
.
<EOS>
I
peered
in
at
the
door
and
recognised
her
in
a
pale
blue
silk
blouse
and
black
net
skirt
,
lying
back
in
a
chair
reading
an
illustrated
paper
.
<EOS>
She
was
evidently
quite
unsuspicious
of
our
presence
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
was
sorely
puzzled
.
<EOS>
Next
morning
he
sent
a
wire
to
Mrs.
Hill
-
Mason
's
house
in
Charles
Street
,
and
before
noon
had
received
a
reply
from
her
at
Bournemouth
saying
that
Fraeulein
Stolberg
had
left
her
service
a
fortnight
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
German
spies
are
pretty
active
in
East
Anglia
,
old
chap
,
as
you
've
seen
with
your
own
eyes
,
"
he
remarked
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
In
order
that
the
woman
should
not
notice
us
,
we
told
the
chauffeur
to
meet
us
out
on
the
Norwich
road
,
after
which
we
travelled
to
quaint
old
Aylsham
,
where
we
idled
away
the
day
,
spending
the
afternoon
playing
billiards
at
the
"
White
Horse
.
"
 
<EOS>
More
than
once
during
the
day
my
companion
examined
the
road
outside
for
traces
of
wheel
-
tracks
,
but
there
were
none
like
those
of
the
car
of
those
secret
agents
of
Hermann
Hartmann
.
 
<EOS>
I
noticed
that
Ray
had
brought
with
him
a
small
brown
brief
-
bag
,
an
unusual
thing
for
him
to
carry
.
<EOS>
But
that
morning
he
had
placed
it
in
the
car
with
instructions
to
the
chauffeur
to
move
it
on
no
account
.
 
<EOS>
At
four
o'clock
that
afternoon
he
received
a
telegram
,
which
he
read
through
twice
,
and
placed
on
the
fire
,
remarking
:
 
"
From
Vera
.
<EOS>
She
's
received
the
thanks
of
the
Admiralty
for
her
report
.
<EOS>
They
promise
to
make
inquiry
.
<EOS>
Probably
they
'll
send
somebody
over
who
ca
n't
speak
a
word
of
German
!
"
 
<EOS>
We
dined
at
half
-
past
six
off
cold
meat
and
pickles
,
but
not
until
midnight
did
we
set
out
upon
the
road
,
travelling
north
in
the
direction
of
Cromer
,
until
we
came
to
the
cross
roads
at
Hanworth
,
where
we
halted
and
Ray
got
down
to
examine
the
road
.
<EOS>
Wheel
-
tracks
were
there
leading
back
to
Roughton
,
and
these
we
followed
until
,
near
the
entrance
to
the
village
,
now
in
complete
darkness
,
we
descended
,
<EOS>
Ray
lifting
out
his
precious
bag
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
got
your
revolver
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
when
we
had
gone
a
hundred
yards
or
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
for
nowadays
I
always
carried
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
we
are
going
to
get
into
that
house
at
Roughton
<EOS>
I
pointed
out
to
you
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
intend
to
have
a
look
round
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
mean
to
break
in
?
<EOS>
Suppose
we
're
caught
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
<EOS>
Spies
are
always
cowards
.
<EOS>
Leave
that
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
we
went
on
until
,
having
passed
through
the
silent
village
,
we
entered
a
road
where
the
bare
trees
met
overhead
,
rendering
it
almost
pitch
-
dark
,
and
presently
approached
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
light
showed
anywhere
.
<EOS>
Whoever
were
its
occupants
,
they
had
retired
.
 
<EOS>
For
nearly
half
an
hour
we
concealed
ourselves
in
the
bushes
opposite
,
watching
in
patience
,
for
the
night
was
as
yet
young
.
<EOS>
In
the
distance
we
fancied
we
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
,
but
they
did
not
advance
;
therefore
we
agreed
that
it
was
only
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
After
waiting
what
seemed
to
me
hours
,
Ray
switched
on
his
electric
lamp
to
see
the
time
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
nearly
two
o'clock
,
so
we
decided
to
take
another
step
forward
.
 
<EOS>
We
crossed
the
road
and
tried
the
iron
gate
.
<EOS>
It
was
locked
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
scale
it
,
and
as
I
was
in
the
act
of
clambering
up
<EOS>
I
was
startled
by
a
strange
voice
behind
me
--
a
woman
's
voice
raising
an
alarm
!
 
<EOS>
Ray
,
who
was
standing
behind
me
,
closed
with
the
unwelcome
stranger
in
an
instant
,
and
placed
his
hand
forcibly
over
her
mouth
while
I
sprang
back
to
assist
him
.
<EOS>
That
moment
was
an
exciting
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
Put
your
handkerchief
in
her
mouth
,
man
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
see
who
it
is
--
the
woman
Stolberg
!
"
 
<EOS>
Quick
<EOS>
as
thought
I
took
out
my
handkerchief
and
stuffed
it
into
her
mouth
while
he
held
her
.
<EOS>
Then
I
gripped
her
arms
,
while
Ray
produced
the
thin
silk
rope
which
he
usually
carried
on
such
expeditions
and
with
<EOS>
it
bound
her
tightly
hand
and
foot
.
 
<EOS>
She
struggled
violently
,
cursing
us
in
German
the
while
,
but
all
in
vain
.
<EOS>
So
at
length
we
disposed
of
her
comfortably
against
a
tree
-
trunk
in
a
field
opposite
,
to
which
Ray
very
deftly
secured
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
evidently
driven
over
from
Cromer
on
some
important
errand
to
her
friends
and
had
stopped
the
cart
some
distance
away
from
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Cautiously
we
negotiated
the
high
iron
gate
,
and
creeping
noiselessly
across
the
lawn
,
gained
the
window
on
the
left
of
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
Ray
flashed
his
light
upon
it
,
and
noting
that
the
fastening
was
only
an
ordinary
one
,
promptly
commenced
work
upon
it
by
inserting
one
of
his
burglarious
tools
between
the
sashes
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
it
sprang
back
with
a
click
,
and
lifting
the
sash
slowly
and
pushing
aside
the
holland
blind
,
he
swung
himself
into
a
comfortably
furnished
sitting
-
room
,
<EOS>
I
following
quickly
at
his
heels
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
dead
silence
I
could
hear
my
heart
throbbing
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
actually
in
the
house
of
the
spies
!
 
<EOS>
The
room
,
which
contained
nothing
of
interest
to
us
,
smelt
strongly
of
tobacco
,
while
upon
the
table
lay
a
big
German
pipe
.
<EOS>
Still
gripping
his
leather
bag
<EOS>
Ray
carefully
opened
the
door
,
and
crossing
the
wide
old
-
fashioned
hall
,
opened
another
door
,
when
we
found
ourselves
in
an
old
-
fashioned
dining
-
room
,
the
sideboard
of
which
was
decorated
with
some
very
nice
antique
blue
china
.
<EOS>
From
this
apartment
we
visited
the
drawing
-
room
and
another
smaller
reception
-
room
,
and
then
,
creeping
on
tiptoe
,
we
ascended
the
old
well
staircase
which
once
creaked
horribly
beneath
me
.
 
<EOS>
Here
we
were
confronted
with
a
serious
problem
.
<EOS>
We
knew
not
in
which
room
the
spies
were
sleeping
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
halted
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
to
take
his
bearings
,
and
after
some
hesitation
resolved
to
first
investigate
the
room
over
the
one
by
which
we
had
entered
.
<EOS>
He
tried
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
was
locked
on
the
inside
.
<EOS>
Somebody
was
within
.
 
<EOS>
So
we
crept
across
to
the
opposite
side
.
<EOS>
Here
the
door
was
also
locked
,
but
a
flash
from
the
torch
revealed
that
there
was
no
key
inside
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
locked
room
,
and
Ray
determined
to
see
what
lay
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
with
infinite
care
not
to
make
a
sound
,
he
drew
from
his
pocket
some
skeleton
keys
,
one
of
which
slid
back
the
bolt
,
and
in
a
moment
we
were
within
.
 
<EOS>
The
torch
,
an
instant
later
,
revealed
an
amazing
state
of
things
.
<EOS>
Pinned
down
to
the
large
deal
table
before
the
window
was
a
huge
map
of
the
district
from
Weybourne
towards
Yarmouth
,
about
five
feet
square
,
made
up
of
various
sections
of
the
six
-
inch
ordnance
map
,
and
literally
covered
with
annotations
and
amplifications
in
German
,
written
in
red
ink
.
<EOS>
Upon
strings
stretched
across
one
end
of
the
room
were
a
number
of
photographic
films
and
prints
in
process
of
drying
,
while
strewn
about
the
place
were
rough
military
sketches
--
the
result
of
the
labours
of
many
months
--
a
couple
of
cameras
,
measuring
tapes
,
a
heliograph
apparatus
,
a
portfolio
full
of
carefully
drawn
plans
with
German
explanations
beneath
,
and
a
tin
box
,
which
,
when
opened
,
we
found
to
contain
a
number
of
neatly
written
reports
and
memoranda
in
German
,
all
ready
for
transmission
to
Berlin
!
 
<EOS>
Ray
seized
a
whole
handful
of
these
papers
--
a
translation
of
one
of
which
is
here
reproduced
--
and
stuffed
them
into
his
pocket
,
saying
:
 
"
These
will
prove
interesting
reading
for
us
later
on
,
no
doubt
.

A

<EOS>
But
just
at
that
moment
in
stepping
back
I
unfortunately
knocked
over
a
frame
containing
some
glass
negatives
,
which
fell
from
a
shelf
with
a
loud
crash
.
 
<EOS>
We
both
stood
breathless
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
quick
movement
in
the
room
adjoining
,
and
we
heard
men
's
voices
shouting
to
each
other
in
German
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
here
,
"
Ray
said
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
not
show
the
white
feather
now
.
"
 
Almost
as
the
words
left
his
mouth
we
were
confronted
by
the
two
men
whom
we
had
seen
surveying
the
railway
line
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
cried
Ray
,
gripping
his
precious
bag
and
facing
them
boldly
,
<EOS>
"
you
see
we
've
discovered
your
little
game
,
gentlemen
!
<EOS>
Those
notes
on
the
map
are
particularly
interesting
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
what
right
,
pray
,
do
you
enter
here
?
"
asked
the
bearded
man
,
speaking
in
fairly
good
English
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
the
right
of
an
Englishman
,
Herr
Stolberg
,
"
was
Ray
's
bold
reply
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
find
your
clever
wife
tied
up
to
a
tree
in
the
field
opposite
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
younger
man
held
a
revolver
,
but
from
his
face
I
saw
that
he
was
a
coward
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
demanded
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
I
intend
destroying
all
this
excellent
espionage
work
of
yours
.
<EOS>
You
've
lived
here
for
two
years
,
and
have
been
very
busy
travelling
in
your
car
and
gathering
information
.
<EOS>
But
,
"
he
said
,
"
you
were
a
little
unwise
in
putting
upon
your
car
the
new
Feldmarck
non
-
skids
,
the
only
set
,
I
believe
,
yet
in
England
.
<EOS>
They
may
be
very
good
tyres
,
but
scarcely
adapted
for
spying
purposes
.
<EOS>
I
,
for
instance
,
noticed
the
difference
in
the
tracks
the
wheels
made
one
evening
when
you
met
your
wife
outside
Metfield
Park
,
and
that
is
what
led
me
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
'd
destroy
all
my
notes
and
plans
!
"
<EOS>
he
gasped
,
with
a
fierce
oath
in
German
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
never
do
that
--
you
English
cur
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
stand
aside
and
watch
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
withdrawing
from
the
room
on
to
the
landing
.
<EOS>
"
See
,
look
here
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
opened
his
bag
.
<EOS>
This
caused
both
men
to
withdraw
from
the
room
to
peer
inside
his
bag
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
quiet
movement
,
however
,
Ray
flung
a
small
dark
object
into
the
centre
of
the
room
,
and
in
an
instant
there
was
a
bright
blood
-
red
flash
,
and
the
whole
place
was
one
mass
of
roaring
flames
,
which
,
belching
from
the
door
,
caused
us
all
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
the
place
was
a
furnace
.
 
<EOS>
The
spies
shouted
,
cursed
,
and
fired
their
revolvers
at
us
through
the
thick
smoke
,
but
we
were
quickly
downstairs
and
out
in
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
will
soon
drive
out
the
rats
,
"
laughed
Ray
,
as
we
watched
the
flames
burst
through
the
roof
and
saw
the
two
men
escape
half
dressed
through
the
window
we
had
opened
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
,
with
the
red
glare
behind
us
,
we
hurried
back
to
the
spot
where
we
had
left
our
car
,
Ray
remarked
,
with
a
laugh
of
triumph
:
 
<EOS>
"
Stolberg
bought
that
place
two
years
ago
with
money
,
no
doubt
,
supplied
from
Berlin
,
so
he
's
scarcely
likely
to
come
upon
us
for
incendiarism
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
only
way
--
to
make
one
big
bonfire
of
the
whole
thing
!

HOW

ARE
PREPARING

We

Ray
Raymond
explained
as
we
drove
along
in
a
taxi
-
cab
to
Liverpool
Street
Station
late
one
grey
snowy
afternoon
soon
after
our
return
from
Norfolk
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
away
from
London
for
three
weeks
,
and
I
had
no
idea
of
his
whereabouts
,
except
that
one
night
he
rang
me
up
on
the
telephone
from
the
Cups
Hotel
,
at
Colchester
.
 
<EOS>
An
hour
ago
he
had
returned
to
New
Stone
Buildings
in
the
guise
of
a
respectable
mechanic
in
his
Sunday
clothes
,
and
,
full
of
bustle
and
excitement
,
urged
me
to
run
across
to
Guilford
Street
and
assume
a
similar
disguise
.
<EOS>
Then
,
each
with
his
modest
bag
,
we
had
hailed
a
motor
-
cab
and
given
the
man
instructions
to
drive
to
the
Great
Eastern
terminus
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
read
the
affair
in
this
evening
's
paper
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
my
companion
asked
;
"
the
mystery
at
Button
's
Hill
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Are
we
about
to
investigate
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
my
intention
,
my
dear
Jacox
,
"
was
his
quick
reply
,
as
he
handed
me
his
cigarette
-
case
.
<EOS>
Then
,
ten
minutes
later
,
when
we
were
seated
together
alone
in
a
third
-
class
carriage
slowly
leaving
London
,
he
turned
to
me
,
and
with
a
deep
earnest
look
upon
his
face
,
said
:
 
"
There
's
much
more
behind
what
appears
in
the
papers
regarding
this
curious
affair
--
depend
upon
it
,
old
chap
.
<EOS>
I
've
wired
to
Vera
to
be
prepared
to
come
to
Maldon
on
receipt
of
a
telegram
.
<EOS>
The
facts
,
as
far
as
are
at
present
known
,
are
these
,
"
he
went
on
as
he
slowly
lit
another
cigarette
:
"
At
an
early
hour
this
morning
a
farm
labourer
,
on
his
way
to
work
between
Latchingdon
and
Southminster
,
discovered
,
lying
in
a
ditch
,
the
body
of
James
Pavely
,
aged
forty
-
three
,
a
well
-
known
fisherman
and
pilot
.
<EOS>
His
head
had
been
crushed
by
savage
blows
,
his
clothes
were
soaked
with
blood
,
and
he
was
nearly
buried
beneath
the
snow
.
<EOS>
The
labourer
alarmed
the
police
,
and
the
body
was
conveyed
to
Southminster
.
<EOS>
Pavely
,
who
was
very
popular
at
the
waterside
at
Maldon
,
was
unmarried
,
and
until
recently
had
been
rather
well
-
to
-
do
,
but
<EOS>
for
the
past
few
months
bad
luck
is
said
to
have
persistently
pursued
him
,
and
he
had
been
left
without
a
boat
,
even
without
a
share
in
a
boat
,
and
more
recently
he
had
been
out
of
a
job
altogether
.
<EOS>
Now
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
keen
look
,
"
I
want
to
fix
that
point
in
your
mind
.
<EOS>
For
months
,
ever
since
the
summer
,
he
has
been
known
to
be
on
the
verge
of
starvation
,
yet
the
police
have
found
in
his
trousers
'
pocket
a
handkerchief
in
which
,
carefully
tied
up
,
were
forty
-
nine
sovereigns
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
savings
?
<EOS>
"
I
suggested
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
declared
my
companion
conclusively
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
if
he
was
murdered
,
why
was
n't
the
money
taken
?
<EOS>
"
I
queried
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
smiled
,
his
face
assuming
that
sphinx
-
like
expression
by
which
I
knew
that
he
had
formed
some
theory
--
a
theory
he
was
about
to
put
to
the
test
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
reason
we
have
to
discover
,
Jacox
,
"
he
said
vaguely
.
<EOS>
"
The
dead
man
is
a
pilot
,
"
he
added
;
"
and
in
Maldon
are
many
German
spies
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
see
that
the
fact
of
Pavely
pursuing
the
honourable
calling
of
pilot
would
arouse
the
enmity
of
any
secret
agent
,
"
I
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
,
"
was
my
friend
's
response
;
and
he
became
immersed
in
his
paper
.
 
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
prosperous
little
town
of
Maldon
we
left
our
bags
in
the
cloak
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
snow
was
lying
thickly
,
but
it
was
no
longer
falling
.
<EOS>
A
sharp
frost
had
set
in
,
rendering
the
roads
very
slippery
.
<EOS>
In
the
darkness
infrequent
lights
glimmered
here
and
there
in
the
quaint
old
streets
and
among
the
barges
and
coasting
vessels
which
lay
along
the
Hithe
.
<EOS>
The
tide
was
nearly
full
,
and
the
river
covered
with
half
-
congealed
snow
and
ice
.
<EOS>
Few
passengers
were
abroad
that
wintry
evening
,
but
as
we
passed
a
small
low
-
built
public
-
house
called
the
"
Goat
and
Binnacle
,
"
at
the
waterside
,
we
could
hear
that
there
were
many
customers
within
,
all
of
whom
seemed
to
be
talking
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
The
red
-
curtained
windows
reflected
a
ruddy
chequer
upon
the
trampled
snow
,
and
men
were
coming
up
by
twos
and
threes
from
the
river
craft
,
one
and
all
wending
their
way
to
that
low
-
browed
house
which
seemed
to
be
doing
such
a
roaring
trade
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
's
take
a
look
inside
,
"
Ray
suggested
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
We
might
hear
something
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
together
we
turned
back
,
and
entered
the
low
-
built
,
old
-
fashioned
place
.
 
<EOS>
Within
,
we
found
them
all
discussing
the
mysterious
death
of
Jim
Pavely
.
 
<EOS>
Mostly
English
were
the
bronzed
,
weather
-
beaten
men
of
the
sea
and
the
longshoremen
who
were
smoking
and
drinking
,
and
talking
so
earnestly
,
but
a
few
foreigners
were
among
them
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
or
three
Frenchmen
,
dapper
fellows
in
well
-
made
pea
-
jackets
and
berets
,
who
had
rowed
ashore
from
the
big
white
yawl
flying
the
tricolour
,
which
had
been
lying
off
Heybridge
waiting
,
so
we
heard
,
for
a
change
from
the
present
icy
weather
before
going
to
sea
again
;
and
there
were
also
a
fair
number
of
Swedes
and
Norwegians
from
the
two
timber
-
ships
whose
spars
<EOS>
,
we
had
noticed
,
towered
above
the
rows
of
smaller
and
stumpier
masts
belonging
to
the
local
and
coasting
craft
which
lay
alongside
the
Hithe
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
the
first
mate
of
one
of
the
timber
-
ships
,
supposed
by
most
of
those
present
to
be
a
German
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
he
seemed
to
be
trying
hard
to
carry
on
a
conversation
with
the
fair
-
haired
landlord
,
an
undoubted
immigrant
from
the
Fatherland
.
 
<EOS>
From
one
of
the
seafaring
customers
with
whom
I
began
to
chat
,
I
learned
that
the
keeper
of
the
place
was
named
Leopold
Bramberger
,
and
that
he
had
been
established
in
that
little
river
-
side
hostelry
rather
more
than
a
year
,
and
was
now
a
well
-
known
and
more
or
less
respected
inhabitant
of
the
borough
of
Maldon
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
a
little
money
--
so
it
was
generally
understood
--
in
the
course
of
some
years
'
service
at
the
Carlton
Hotel
in
London
as
waiter
.
<EOS>
And
a
good
waiter
he
certainly
was
,
as
many
people
living
in
that
part
of
the
country
could
testify
;
since
he
found
time
to
go
out
as
"
an
extra
hand
"
to
many
a
dinner
-
party
;
his
services
being
much
appreciated
and
bringing
him
in
quite
a
comfortable
little
addition
to
what
he
made
by
the
sale
of
drink
down
by
the
Blackwater
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
seem
very
anxious
to
talk
with
his
compatriot
;
indeed
,
so
frequent
were
the
demands
made
for
"
another
pot
of
four
'
arf
,
"
"
two
of
gin
'
ot
,
"
"
<EOS>
another
glass
of
Scotch
,
"
and
other
delectable
beverages
,
that
he
and
his
better
half
had
all
they
could
do
to
grapple
with
the
wants
of
their
customers
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
conversation
about
us
we
gathered
that
the
dead
man
,
though
previously
somewhat
abstemious
,
had
lately
become
rather
a
constant
frequenter
of
the
"
Goat
and
Binnacle
,
"
and
though
no
one
had
seen
him
actually
drunk
,
there
were
not
a
few
who
could
testify
to
having
seen
him
in
a
state
very
nearly
approaching
,
in
their
opinion
,
to
"
half
-
seas
-
over
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'
give
suthing
to
lay
my
'
ands
on
the
blackguard
as
'
as
done
for
pore
Jim
,
"
remarked
a
burly
longshoreman
to
his
neighbour
.
"
<EOS>
'
E'd
never
done
no
one
a
bad
turn
,
as
I
knows
on
,
and
a
better
feller
there
was
n't
between
'
ere
<EOS>
an
'
'
Arwich
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
there
was
n't
,
"
came
quite
a
chorus
.
<EOS>
Jim
Pavely
,
whatever
his
misfortunes
,
was
evidently
a
favourite
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
no
one
would
n't
have
any
idea
of
robbin
'
pore
Jim
,
"
interposed
another
customer
;
"
every
one
knows
that
there
's
bin
nothin'
on
'
i
m
wuth
stealin
'
<EOS>
this
many
a
day
--
pore
chap
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Except
that
forty
-
nine
pound
,
"
remarked
the
German
landlord
,
in
very
good
English
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
for
that
,
"
exclaimed
a
little
man
sitting
in
the
chimney
-
corner
,
"
<EOS>
I
see
Belton
,
the
constable
,
as
I
were
a
-
coming
down
here
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
,
an
'
he
says
as
how
there
was
n't
no
signs
of
any
attempt
at
robbery
.
<EOS>
Jim
had
his
old
five
-
bob
watch
in
'
is
pocket
,
not
worth
pawnin
'
;
the
sovereigns
and
some
silver
were
in
his
trousers
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
That
's
the
mystery
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
more
than
one
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
Why
no
one
would
n't
have
thought
as
Jim
'
ad
seen
the
colour
o
'
gold
this
three
months
past
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
on
in
and
shut
the
door
,
"
cried
some
one
,
as
a
new
-
comer
entered
the
tap
-
room
,
followed
by
an
icy
blast
and
a
shower
of
snow
,
which
was
again
falling
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
's
Sergeant
Newte
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
publican
,
as
a
burly
man
in
a
dark
overcoat
entered
,
carefully
closed
the
door
,
and
moved
ponderously
towards
the
bar
.
<EOS>
A
sudden
hush
fell
upon
the
assembly
,
all
eyes
and
ears
being
turned
towards
the
representative
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
All
felt
that
the
plain
-
clothes
man
bore
news
of
the
tragedy
,
and
waited
anxiously
for
the
oracle
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
asked
Bramberger
,
"
and
what
can
I
have
the
pleasure
of
serving
you
with
?
<EOS>
It
is
n't
often
we
have
the
honour
of
your
company
down
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
have
anything
to
-
night
,
thanks
,
"
answered
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
a
drink
I
'm
after
,
but
just
a
little
information
that
I
fancy
you
,
or
some
of
these
gentlemen
here
,
may
be
able
to
give
me
.
<EOS>
Every
one
knows
that
James
Pavely
was
a
pretty
frequent
customer
of
yours
,
and
what
I
want
to
find
out
is
,
when
he
was
last
in
here
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
.
<EOS>
Last
night
about
seven
,
was
n't
it
,
Molly
?
<EOS>
"
returned
the
landlord
,
turning
to
his
wife
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
by
the
by
,
he
came
in
and
had
something
about
a
quarter
to
nine
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
last
we
saw
of
him
,
poor
fellow
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
sergeant
in
plain
clothes
produced
his
notebook
.
<EOS>
"
Who
else
was
in
the
bar
with
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nobody
in
particular
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
hands
from
the
barges
,
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
He
just
had
his
drink
and
passed
the
time
of
day
,
as
you
may
say
,
and
was
off
in
five
or
ten
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
but
you
're
making
a
mistake
there
,
Mr.
Bramberger
,
"
spoke
up
a
voice
near
by
;
and
the
officer
turned
sharply
in
the
direction
of
the
speaker
.
 
<EOS>
Urged
on
by
those
standing
round
him
,
Robert
Rait
,
a
big
longshoreman
,
came
slowly
to
the
front
.
<EOS>
All
eyes
were
upon
him
,
which
caused
him
to
assume
a
somewhat
sheepish
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sergeant
,
true
as
I
'm
standing
'
ere
,
I
see
pore
Jim
come
out
of
this
'
ere
bar
just
after
twelve
last
night
along
with
that
young
gent
as
is
learnin
'
farming
over
Latchingdon
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
every
one
grew
interested
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
of
what
you
say
?
"
asked
the
officer
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sartin
sure
.
<EOS>
I
were
sittin
'
on
my
barge
a
-
smokin
'
my
pipe
,
<EOS>
an
'
I
'
eard
the
clock
over
at
the
church
,
behind
'
ere
,
strike
twelve
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
,
but
I
remember
I
counted
the
strokes
.
<EOS>
Five
minutes
later
out
come
Pavely
with
the
young
gent
,
who
I
've
often
seen
in
this
bar
afore
,
an
'
they
walked
off
round
by
the
Marine
Lake
.
<EOS>
They
never
took
no
notice
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
me
.
<EOS>
They
was
too
busy
a
'
talkin
'
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
the
policeman
slowly
rendered
this
into
writing
,
most
eyes
sought
Bramberger
,
who
,
feeling
that
he
was
the
object
of
an
attention
perhaps
not
too
favourable
,
remarked
:
 
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
yes
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
'm
wrong
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
It
was
twelve
o'clock
<EOS>
I
meant
--
not
nine
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
about
this
young
gent
?
<EOS>
"
queried
the
constable
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
he
,
anyway
?
<EOS>
Was
he
here
with
Pavely
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
might
have
gone
out
with
him
<EOS>
,
I
did
n't
take
particular
notice
of
him
,
"
the
German
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
who
is
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
know
him
well
enough
.
<EOS>
He
's
often
in
Maldon
.
<EOS>
It
's
young
Mr.
Freeman
,
who
's
learning
estate
work
with
Mr.
Harris
,
near
Southminster
.
<EOS>
He
does
drop
in
here
now
and
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
know
him
.
<EOS>
A
fellow
-
countryman
of
yours
,
ai
n't
he
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
he
's
English
.
<EOS>
I
'd
know
a
German
well
enough
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
've
heard
him
speak
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Jones
,
the
schoolmaster
,
told
me
once
he
thought
he
spoke
with
a
German
accent
,
"
replied
the
officer
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
he
do
,
Sergeant
,
"
spoke
up
a
sailorman
,
"
<EOS>
now
you
mention
it
.
<EOS>
I
'm
often
in
Hamburg
,
an
'
I
know
the
German
accent
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
anything
about
that
forty
-
nine
pounds
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
blundering
local
sergeant
of
police
,
for
,
as
is
usually
the
case
,
the
aid
of
New
Scotland
Yard
had
not
been
invoked
.
<EOS>
The
police
in
our
small
country
towns
are
always
very
loath
to
request
assistance
from
London
,
as
such
action
is
admission
of
their
own
incompetence
.
<EOS>
Many
a
murder
mystery
could
be
solved
and
the
criminal
brought
to
justice
by
prompt
investigation
by
competent
detectives
.
<EOS>
But
after
blunt
inquiries
such
as
those
now
in
progress
,
success
is
usually
rendered
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
Raymond
exchanged
glances
with
me
and
smiled
.
<EOS>
How
different
,
I
reflected
,
were
his
careful
,
painstaking
,
and
often
mysterious
methods
of
investigation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Those
sovereigns
in
'
is
'
andkerchief
are
a
puzzle
,
"
declared
the
man
Rait
,
"
but
somehow
I
fancy
there
's
been
<EOS>
a
bit
o
'
mystery
about
pore
Jim
of
late
.
<EOS>
Teddy
Owen
told
me
a
week
ago
'
e
see
'
i
m
up
in
London
,
a
-
talkin
'
with
a
foreigner
on
the
platform
at
Liverpool
Street
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Owen
?
"
asked
the
sergeant
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gone
over
to
Malmoe
on
a
Swedish
timber
-
ship
,
"
was
Robert
Rait
's
reply
.
"
<EOS>
'
E
wo
n't
be
back
for
a
couple
of
months
,
I
dare
say
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
statement
of
the
man
Owen
was
to
Raymond
and
myself
very
significant
and
suspicious
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
the
pilot
Pavely
had
sold
some
secret
to
a
foreign
agent
,
and
that
the
money
he
carried
with
him
on
the
previous
night
was
the
price
of
his
treason
?
<EOS>
It
was
distinctly
curious
that
the
assassin
had
not
possessed
himself
of
that
handkerchief
full
of
sovereigns
.
 
<EOS>
We
lingered
in
the
low
-
pitched
inn
for
yet
another
half
-
hour
,
my
companion
accounting
for
our
visit
by
telling
one
of
the
men
a
fictitious
story
that
we
had
been
sent
to
install
the
electric
light
in
some
new
premises
at
the
back
of
the
old
church
.
<EOS>
We
heard
several
more
inquiries
made
by
the
sergeant
,
and
many
were
the
wild
theories
advanced
by
those
seafaring
loungers
.
<EOS>
Then
,
having
listened
attentively
to
all
that
passed
,
we
retraced
our
steps
to
the
station
,
obtained
our
bags
,
and
drove
to
the
King
's
Head
Hotel
,
where
we
duly
installed
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
something
very
big
behind
the
cruel
murder
of
the
pilot
--
that
's
my
belief
!
"
declared
Raymond
before
we
parted
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
Nobody
here
dreams
the
truth
--
a
truth
that
will
be
found
as
startling
as
it
is
strange
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
of
my
suspicions
that
the
publican
Bramberger
was
a
spy
.
<EOS>
But
he
shook
his
head
,
saying
:
 
"
Do
n't
form
any
immature
conclusions
,
my
dear
Jacox
.
<EOS>
At
present
the
truth
is
very
cunningly
concealed
.
<EOS>
It
remains
for
us
to
lift
the
veil
and
expose
the
truth
to
the
police
and
the
public
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Three
days
passed
.
<EOS>
Ray
Raymond
remained
practically
inactive
,
save
that
we
both
attended
the
inquest
at
Southminster
as
members
of
the
public
and
listened
to
the
evidence
.
<EOS>
The
revelation
that
a
man
apparently
in
a
state
of
great
destitution
carried
forty
-
nine
sovereigns
upon
him
struck
the
coroner
as
unusual
,
and
at
his
direction
the
jury
adjourned
the
inquiry
for
a
week
,
to
allow
the
police
to
make
further
investigation
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
this
was
decided
my
companion
at
once
became
all
activity
.
<EOS>
He
found
the
man
Rait
,
a
big
,
clumsy
seafarer
,
and
questioned
him
.
<EOS>
But
from
him
he
obtained
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
With
the
publican
Bramberger
he
contrived
to
strike
up
a
friendship
,
loudly
declaring
his
theory
that
the
motive
of
the
murder
of
poor
Pavely
was
jealousy
,
it
being
now
known
that
he
had
been
courting
the
pretty
daughter
of
an
old
boatman
over
at
Burnham
.
 
<EOS>
My
position
was
,
as
usual
,
one
of
silent
obedience
.
<EOS>
Hither
and
thither
<EOS>
I
went
at
his
bidding
,
leaving
to
his
,
the
master
mind
,
the
gradual
solution
of
the
mystery
.
<EOS>
He
was
one
of
those
secretive
men
who
delighted
in
retaining
something
up
his
sleeve
.
<EOS>
The
expression
upon
his
face
was
never
indicative
of
what
was
passing
within
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
The
adjourned
inquest
was
held
at
last
,
and
again
we
were
both
present
at
the
back
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
police
practically
admitted
their
inability
to
solve
the
mystery
,
and
after
a
long
deliberation
the
twelve
tradesmen
returned
a
verdict
of
"
wilful
murder
,
"
leaving
the
constabulary
to
further
prosecute
their
inquiries
.
 
<EOS>
Nearly
a
fortnight
had
passed
since
the
sturdy
North
Sea
pilot
had
been
so
cruelly
done
to
death
,
and
many
were
the
new
theories
advanced
nightly
in
the
smoke
-
room
of
the
"
Goat
and
Binnacle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
still
remained
at
the
"
King
's
Head
,
"
but
Raymond
was
often
absent
for
whole
days
,
and
by
his
manner
I
knew
the
spy
-
seeker
to
be
busy
investigating
some
theory
he
had
formed
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
absent
a
couple
of
days
,
staying
over
at
the
"
White
Hart
"
at
Burnham
-
on
-
Crouch
,
that
place
so
frequented
by
boating
men
in
summer
,
when
one
afternoon
I
ran
over
to
Chelmsford
to
call
upon
a
man
I
knew
.
<EOS>
It
was
about
ten
o'clock
at
night
when
I
left
his
house
to
walk
to
the
station
to
catch
the
last
train
,
when
,
to
my
surprise
,
I
saw
close
to
the
Town
Hall
a
smart
female
figure
in
a
black
tailor
-
made
gown
and
big
black
hat
,
walking
before
me
,
accompanied
by
a
tall
,
thin
,
rather
well
-
dressed
young
man
in
breeches
and
gaiters
,
who
seemed
to
be
something
of
a
dandy
.
 
<EOS>
The
girl
's
back
struck
me
as
familiar
,
and
I
crossed
the
road
and
went
forward
so
as
to
get
a
glance
at
her
face
beneath
the
street
-
lamp
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
was
not
mistaken
.
<EOS>
It
was
Vera
Vallance
!
<EOS>
Her
companion
,
however
,
was
a
complete
stranger
to
me
--
a
well
-
set
-
up
,
rather
good
-
looking
young
fellow
,
with
a
small
black
moustache
,
whose
age
I
guessed
to
be
about
twenty
-
eight
or
so
,
and
whose
dark
eyes
were
peculiarly
bright
and
vivacious
.
<EOS>
He
walked
with
swaggering
gait
,
and
seemed
to
be
of
a
decidedly
horsey
type
.
 
<EOS>
From
their
attitude
it
appeared
that
they
were
intimate
friends
,
and
as
they
walked
towards
the
station
,
I
watched
his
hand
steal
into
her
astrachan
muff
.
 
<EOS>
The
incident
was
certainly
puzzling
.
<EOS>
Was
this
man
Vera
's
secret
lover
?
<EOS>
It
certainly
seemed
so
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
unseen
by
her
,
I
kept
close
vigilance
upon
the
pair
,
watching
them
gain
the
platform
where
stood
the
train
by
which
I
was
to
travel
back
to
Maldon
.
<EOS>
He
entered
a
first
-
class
carriage
,
while
she
remained
upon
the
platform
.
<EOS>
Therefore
it
was
evident
that
she
was
not
accompanying
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
train
moved
off
,
and
,
with
a
laugh
,
she
actually
kissed
her
hand
to
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
Then
I
sat
back
in
my
corner
greatly
puzzled
and
disturbed
.
<EOS>
Surely
Ray
Raymond
could
not
know
of
these
clandestine
meetings
?
 
<EOS>
I
was
well
aware
how
devoted
my
friend
was
to
her
.
<EOS>
Surely
she
was
not
now
faithless
to
her
vow
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
my
place
to
speak
,
so
<EOS>
I
could
only
patiently
watch
the
progress
of
events
.
 
<EOS>
The
dark
-
eyed
man
alighted
with
me
at
Witham
,
but
did
not
enter
the
Maldon
train
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
lost
sight
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Three
days
later
I
caught
sight
of
him
in
the
main
street
at
Maldon
,
still
in
gaiters
and
riding
-
breeches
,
and
wearing
a
black
and
white
check
coat
and
crimson
knitted
vest
.
<EOS>
Unnoticed
,
I
watched
him
come
forth
from
a
saddler
's
shop
,
and
after
making
several
purchases
,
he
strolled
to
my
hotel
,
the
"
King
's
Head
,
"
where
he
was
met
by
an
elderly
clean
-
shaven
man
of
agricultural
type
,
with
whom
he
had
luncheon
in
a
corner
of
the
coffee
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
was
still
absent
.
<EOS>
Would
that
he
had
been
present
,
and
that
I
dared
to
point
out
to
him
the
man
who
had
apparently
usurped
his
place
in
Vera
's
heart
!
 
<EOS>
At
three
o'clock
,
after
his
friend
had
left
,
the
young
man
sat
for
some
time
writing
a
letter
in
the
smoking
-
room
,
and
afterwards
called
the
boots
and
gave
it
to
him
,
with
orders
to
deliver
it
personally
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
left
for
the
station
apparently
on
his
return
to
Witham
.
 
<EOS>
After
I
got
back
to
the
"
King
's
Head
"
I
sought
James
,
the
boots
,
and
inquired
the
addressee
of
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
took
it
round
to
Mr.
Bramberger
at
the
'
Goat
and
Binnacle
,
'
sir
,
"
was
the
servant
's
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
the
young
gentleman
--
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
He
's
Mr.
Freeman
,
from
Woodham
Ferris
.
<EOS>
He
's
what
they
call
a
'
mud
-
pupil
'
of
Mr.
Harris
,
Lord
Croyland
's
agent
.
<EOS>
He
's
learning
estate
-
work
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
he
knows
Mr.
Bramberger
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
I
've
often
taken
notes
for
him
to
the
'
Goat
and
Binnacle
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
was
silent
,
recollecting
the
curious
allegation
made
by
the
man
Rait
,
that
he
had
seen
the
dead
man
in
Freeman
's
company
.
 
<EOS>
Some
other
questions
I
put
to
the
boots
,
but
he
could
tell
me
but
little
else
,
only
that
young
Freeman
was
undoubtedly
a
gentleman
,
that
he
spent
his
money
freely
,
and
possessed
a
large
circle
of
friends
in
the
district
.
 
<EOS>
I
learned
that
he
lived
in
a
small
furnished
cottage
outside
the
dull
little
town
of
Woodham
Ferris
,
and
that
he
had
an
elderly
man
-
servant
who
generally
"
did
"
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Had
I
been
mistaken
in
Vera
's
motive
?
<EOS>
Had
she
become
acquainted
with
him
as
part
of
a
preconceived
plan
,
some
ingenious
plan
formed
by
that
fearless
hunter
of
the
Kaiser
's
spies
,
who
was
my
most
intimate
friend
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
could
only
think
that
I
had
sorely
misjudged
her
.
 
<EOS>
Hearing
nothing
from
Raymond
on
the
following
day
,
and
noticing
that
the
sensation
caused
by
the
death
of
the
pilot
had
,
by
this
time
,
quite
subsided
,
I
went
again
over
to
Chelmsford
and
lunched
at
the
old
-
fashioned
"
Saracen
's
Head
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
To
my
satisfaction
,
I
learned
that
Vera
had
been
staying
there
for
the
past
ten
days
,
and
was
still
there
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
I
left
the
hotel
and
watched
it
during
the
remainder
of
that
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
At
dusk
she
came
forth
neat
and
pretty
as
usual
,
her
face
with
its
soft
fair
hair
half
concealed
by
her
flimsy
veil
.
<EOS>
At
the
door
of
the
hotel
she
hesitated
for
a
second
,
then
she
strolled
to
the
other
side
of
the
town
,
where
,
at
an
unfrequented
corner
,
she
was
joined
by
the
dark
-
eyed
man
Freeman
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
warm
manner
of
his
greeting
it
was
apparent
that
he
was
charmed
by
her
,
and
together
they
strolled
along
the
quiet
byways
,
<EOS>
she
allowing
him
to
link
his
arm
in
hers
.
 
<EOS>
Knowing
her
ready
self
-
sacrifice
wherever
the
interests
of
her
lover
were
concerned
,
I
could
only
surmise
that
her
present
object
was
to
watch
this
man
,
or
to
learn
from
him
some
important
facts
concerning
the
mystery
which
Ray
was
so
silently
investigating
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
fearing
to
be
observed
if
I
followed
the
pair
along
those
quiet
thoroughfares
,
I
turned
on
my
heel
,
and
half
an
hour
later
left
Chelmsford
for
Maldon
.
 
<EOS>
That
same
night
,
soon
after
eleven
,
Ray
Raymond
returned
to
the
"
King
's
Head
,
"
arriving
by
the
last
train
from
London
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
keep
a
wary
eye
upon
that
publican
Bramberger
,
Jacox
,
"
he
whispered
when
we
were
alone
together
in
my
bedroom
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
deal
with
him
.
<EOS>
Frequent
<EOS>
the
'
Goat
and
Binnacle
,
'
and
see
what
's
in
progress
there
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Vera
is
at
Chelmsford
,
I
see
,
"
I
remarked
casually
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
,
"
she
's
already
on
friendly
terms
with
Freeman
.
<EOS>
You
've
seen
her
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
responded
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
to
-
morrow
I
shall
leave
here
again
,
to
reappear
in
Maldon
as
a
river
-
side
labourer
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
retain
your
role
of
electrician
,
and
patronise
the
homely
comforts
of
our
friend
Bramberger
's
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
with
that
clear
decision
which
characterised
all
his
actions
,
<EOS>
for
in
the
investigation
of
any
suspicion
of
the
presence
of
spies
,
he
first
formed
his
theory
,
and
then
started
straight
away
to
prove
it
to
his
own
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
soon
after
one
o'clock
I
re
-
entered
the
low
-
built
little
river
-
side
inn
and
found
within
a
few
bargemen
and
labourers
gossiping
,
as
such
men
will
gossip
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
who
served
me
eyed
me
up
and
down
as
though
half
inclined
to
recognise
me
,
so
I
recalled
the
fact
that
I
had
been
in
his
house
a
week
or
so
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
he
immediately
became
communicative
,
and
we
had
a
friendly
glass
together
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
that
I
had
concluded
my
job
--
in
order
to
account
for
my
hours
of
idleness
in
the
days
that
were
to
follow
--
and
I
then
became
a
regular
customer
,
seldom
leaving
before
the
house
closed
.
 
<EOS>
Bramberger
was
one
day
visited
by
the
German
mate
of
the
timber
-
ship
which
had
just
come
in
,
the
man
of
his
own
nationality
who
had
been
in
the
bar
on
the
night
of
our
arrival
at
Maldon
,
and
who
seemed
to
be
well
known
to
his
usual
customers
,
for
apparently
he
made
regular
visits
from
across
the
North
Sea
.
 
<EOS>
I
noticed
that
during
the
afternoon
they
were
closeted
together
in
the
landlord
's
private
room
,
and
during
the
evening
they
drank
in
company
.
 
<EOS>
The
return
of
this
German
at
once
aroused
my
suspicions
,
therefore
at
ten
o'clock
,
instead
of
returning
to
the
"
King
's
Head
,
"
I
concealed
myself
at
the
waterside
and
there
waited
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
intensely
cold
vigil
,
and
as
the
time
crept
by
,
and
the
church
clock
struck
hour
after
hour
,
I
began
to
fear
that
my
suspicions
were
unfounded
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
however
,
from
the
timber
-
craft
lying
in
the
Blackwater
came
a
boat
noiselessly
into
the
deep
shadow
,
and
from
it
landed
two
men
,
each
carrying
a
heavy
box
upon
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
They
walked
straight
over
to
the
"
Goat
and
Binnacle
,
"
the
side
door
of
which
opened
noiselessly
,
and
having
deposited
their
loads
,
they
returned
to
the
boat
.
<EOS>
This
journey
to
and
fro
they
repeated
four
times
.
<EOS>
Then
they
rowed
away
,
and
though
I
waited
the
greater
part
of
the
night
,
they
did
not
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
reported
this
in
a
note
I
sent
round
to
Ray
at
his
lodging
in
the
poorer
quarter
of
the
town
,
and
in
reply
I
received
a
message
that
he
would
meet
me
at
the
river
-
side
at
eleven
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
Part
of
that
evening
<EOS>
I
spent
smoking
in
the
inn
,
and
<EOS>
an
hour
after
closing
-
time
I
came
upon
my
friend
with
whispered
greeting
at
the
appointed
spot
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
seen
Freeman
?
"
was
his
first
question
,
and
when
I
replied
in
the
negative
,
he
told
me
that
he
had
just
been
admitted
by
Bramberger
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
got
your
revolver
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
always
carry
it
nowadays
,
"
was
my
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
old
chap
,
to
-
night
promises
to
be
exciting
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
.
"
<EOS>
Look
!
<EOS>
There
are
three
men
lurking
under
that
wall
over
yonder
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
he
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
They
're
our
friends
.
<EOS>
To
-
night
we
shall
avenge
the
death
of
the
poor
pilot
Pavely
.
<EOS>
But
remain
silent
,
and
you
'll
see
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
noted
that
the
three
dark
figures
concealed
near
us
were
water
-
side
labourers
,
<EOS>
fellows
whose
rough
-
looking
exteriors
were
the
reverse
of
reassuring
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
recollected
that
every
man
who
worked
on
the
Blackwater
or
the
Crouch
was
a
patriot
,
ready
to
tear
the
mask
from
the
spies
of
England
's
enemies
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
have
waited
in
patience
fully
three
hours
,
when
again
from
the
timber
-
ship
lying
in
the
Blackwater
came
the
laden
boat
,
and
again
were
similar
boxes
landed
and
carried
in
the
shadow
up
to
the
inn
,
the
door
of
which
opened
silently
to
receive
them
.
<EOS>
Wherever
the
Customs
officers
or
police
were
,
they
noticed
nothing
amiss
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
men
had
made
their
second
journey
to
the
"
Goat
and
Binnacle
,
"
when
Ray
Raymond
suddenly
exclaimed
:
 
<EOS>
"
We
're
going
to
rush
the
place
,
Jacox
.
<EOS>
Have
your
gun
ready
"
;
and
then
he
gave
a
low
whistle
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
moment
fully
a
dozen
men
,
some
of
whom
I
recognised
as
Customs
officers
in
mufti
and
police
in
plain
clothes
,
together
with
several
longshoremen
,
emerged
from
the
shadow
,
and
in
a
moment
we
had
surrounded
the
public
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
had
closed
upon
the
two
men
who
carried
up
the
boxes
,
and
a
demand
that
it
should
be
reopened
met
with
no
response
.
<EOS>
Therefore
a
long
iron
bar
was
procured
from
somewhere
,
and
two
policemen
working
with
it
soon
prised
the
door
from
its
hinges
.
 
<EOS>
The
lights
within
had
all
been
suddenly
extinguished
,
but
finding
myself
in
the
little
bar
-
parlour
with
two
others
of
the
party
,
I
struck
a
vesta
and
relit
the
gas
.
 
<EOS>
Two
of
the
mysterious
wooden
cases
brought
from
the
ship
were
standing
there
.
 
<EOS>
We
heard
loud
shouts
in
German
,
and
a
scuffle
upon
the
stairs
in
the
darkness
,
followed
by
a
shot
.
<EOS>
Then
a
woman
's
scream
mingled
with
the
shouts
and
curses
of
my
companions
,
and
I
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
a
wild
melee
,
in
which
furniture
and
bottles
were
being
smashed
about
me
.
<EOS>
My
friends
were
trying
to
secure
Bramberger
and
Freeman
,
while
both
were
fighting
desperately
for
their
lives
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
made
a
sudden
spring
upon
the
young
man
who
had
been
so
attracted
by
Vera
Vallance
,
but
for
his
pains
received
a
savage
cut
in
the
arm
from
a
knife
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
stood
at
bay
in
the
corner
of
the
smoke
-
room
with
half
a
dozen
of
us
before
him
.
<EOS>
The
fellow
had
set
his
jaws
fiercely
,
and
there
was
murder
in
his
black
eyes
.
<EOS>
Bramberger
,
however
,
had
already
been
secured
,
and
handcuffs
had
been
slipped
upon
him
by
the
police
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
cried
Ray
Raymond
,
"
tell
your
story
,
Richardson
.
<EOS>
These
two
blackguards
must
hear
it
before
we
hand
them
over
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
noticed
that
near
me
were
two
policemen
,
who
had
covered
Freeman
with
their
revolvers
.
 
<EOS>
From
among
us
a
rough
man
in
a
shabby
pea
-
jacket
,
whom
I
had
seen
once
or
twice
in
that
inn
,
came
forward
,
and
without
a
word
of
preliminary
exclaimed
:
 
"
<EOS>
Jim
Pavely
,
the
poor
fellow
whom
these
accursed
foreigners
murdered
,
was
my
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
The
night
before
he
was
killed
he
slept
at
my
house
.
<EOS>
He
was
drunk
,
but
he
told
me
something
that
at
first
I
did
n't
believe
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
that
on
the
previous
day
,
spending
so
much
time
about
this
place
,
he
had
stumbled
on
the
fact
that
a
certain
German
timber
-
ship
was
in
the
habit
of
bringing
up
among
its
cargo
a
quantity
of
saccharine
which
was
smuggled
ashore
at
night
and
stored
in
the
cellars
below
here
.
<EOS>
He
had
had
words
with
the
landlord
Bramberger
,
but
the
latter
had
made
him
promise
to
keep
his
secret
till
next
morning
,
when
he
would
pay
him
a
certain
sum
to
say
nothing
to
the
Customs
officers
.
<EOS>
Next
afternoon
at
four
o'clock
he
went
to
the
'
Goat
and
Binnacle
'
to
receive
the
money
,
and
I
entered
after
him
,
intending
to
assist
him
in
getting
all
he
could
out
of
the
German
.
<EOS>
But
that
fellow
Freeman
,
yonder
--
whom
I
know
to
be
also
a
German
--
was
with
his
compatriot
,
and
the
three
had
consultation
together
in
the
back
room
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
later
Jim
Pavely
came
back
to
my
house
and
showed
me
fifty
pounds
,
and
a
written
agreement
signed
by
Bramberger
to
pay
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
more
in
gold
in
Calais
,
on
condition
that
he
remained
abroad
and
held
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Then
the
informer
paused
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
"
I
urged
.
<EOS>
"
What
then
?
"
 
"
Pavely
told
me
something
--
something
he
had
discovered
.
<EOS>
But
I
foolishly
laughed
his
statement
to
scorn
.
<EOS>
He
added
that
he
was
to
sail
in
a
French
schooner
that
night
,
and
that
Freeman
,
who
was
in
partnership
with
Bramberger
,
was
to
go
over
to
Latchingdon
with
him
that
evening
and
introduce
him
to
the
skipper
,
who
would
land
him
at
Calais
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
gone
,
the
story
he
had
told
me
struck
me
as
very
astounding
;
therefore
I
resolved
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
I
saw
him
come
with
Freeman
out
of
this
place
just
after
midnight
,
and
I
followed
them
.
<EOS>
When
they
got
to
Button
's
Hill
,
on
that
lonely
stretch
of
road
,
I
saw
with
my
own
eyes
Freeman
suddenly
attack
him
with
a
life
-
preserver
,
and
having
smashed
his
skull
before
I
could
interfere
,
he
stole
the
German
's
undertaking
from
his
pocket
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
,
the
man
accused
,
standing
in
the
corner
covered
by
several
revolvers
,
turned
livid
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
protest
,
but
his
voice
was
only
faint
and
hollow
before
the
living
witness
of
his
crime
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
collapsed
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
first
impulse
was
to
denounce
the
assassin
,
but
what
the
dead
man
had
told
me
caused
me
to
hesitate
,
and
I
resolved
to
first
get
at
the
truth
,
which
I
have
done
with
Mr.
Raymond
's
aid
,
"
Richardson
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
The
story
of
the
schooner
was
true
,
"
he
added
,
"
except
that
it
was
a
steam
schooner
-
rigged
yacht
which
was
about
to
land
some
stuff
for
another
depot
at
Burnham
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
stuff
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ammunition
ready
for
the
German
army
when
it
lands
upon
this
coast
.
<EOS>
It
was
that
fact
which
Pavely
had
discovered
and
told
me
.
<EOS>
After
agreeing
to
keep
the
secret
of
the
saccharine
,
it
seems
that
he
discovered
that
the
boxes
really
contained
cartridges
,
a
fact
which
he
urged
me
to
communicate
to
the
War
Office
after
he
had
secured
the
German
's
bribe
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
declared
Raymond
,
"
the
extensive
cellaring
under
this
place
is
packed
to
the
ceiling
with
ammunition
ready
for
the
Day
of
Invasion
.
<EOS>
See
this
,
which
has
just
been
brought
!
"
 
<EOS>
After
prising
open
one
of
the
boxes
,
many
rounds
of
German
rifle
-
cartridges
were
revealed
.
<EOS>
"
That
man
Freeman
before
you
,
though
brought
up
in
England
and
passing
as
an
Englishman
,
is
,
I
have
discovered
,
a
German
agent
,
who
,
in
the
guise
of
estate
-
pupil
,
has
been
busy
composing
a
voluminous
report
upon
supplies
,
accommodation
,
forage
,
possible
landing
-
places
,
and
other
information
useful
to
the
invader
.
<EOS>
His
district
has
been
the
important
country
between
the
Blackwater
and
the
Crouch
,
eastward
of
Maldon
and
Purleigh
.
<EOS>
Bramberger
,
who
is
also
in
the
German
Secret
Service
,
has
been
accumulating
this
store
of
ammunition
as
well
as
forwarding
his
coadjutor
's
reports
and
plans
to
Berlin
,
for
,
being
German
,
it
excited
no
suspicion
that
he
posted
many
bulky
letters
to
Germany
.
<EOS>
He
is
often
in
direct
communication
with
our
friend
in
Pont
Street
.
<EOS>
My
secret
investigations
revealed
all
this
,
Jacox
,
hence
I
arranged
this
raid
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
never
take
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Freeman
in
defiance
.
<EOS>
But
next
moment
these
men
,
all
of
them
constables
in
plain
clothes
,
closed
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
moment
there
was
another
desperate
struggle
,
when
with
startling
suddenness
a
shot
rang
out
,
and
I
saw
Bramberger
drop
to
the
floor
like
a
stone
at
my
feet
.
 
<EOS>
Freeman
had
wrested
a
weapon
from
one
of
his
assailants
and
killed
his
fellow
-
spy
;
while
,
next
instant
,
without
reflection
,
he
turned
the
revolver
upon
himself
,
and
,
before
they
could
prevent
him
,
had
put
a
shot
through
his
own
brain
,
inflicting
a
wound
that
within
half
a
minute
proved
mortal
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
searched
the
cellars
of
the
"
Goat
and
Binnacle
"
we
found
no
fewer
than
eighty
-
two
cases
of
rifle
cartridges
;
while
next
morning
,
in
a
small
cottage
within
a
stone's
-
throw
of
the
"
White
Hart
"
at
Burnham
,
we
discovered
sixty
-
odd
cases
of
ammunition
for
various
arms
,
together
with
ten
cases
of
gun
cotton
and
some
other
high
explosives
.
<EOS>
Also
we
found
six
big
cases
full
of
proclamations
,
printed
in
English
,
threatening
all
who
opposed
the
German
advance
with
death
.
<EOS>
The
document
was
a
very
remarkable
one
,
and
deeming
it
of
sufficient
interest
,
I
have
reproduced
it
in

Copy
of
the
German
Proclamation
found
in
the
Secret
Store
of

at
Burnham

.
 
<EOS>
The
affair
caused
the
greatest
consternation
at
the
War
Office
,
at
whose
instigation
it
was
instantly
hushed
up
by
the
police
for
fear
of
creating
undue
panic
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
truth
remains
--
a
very
bitter
,
serious
,
and
significant
truth
--
of
Germany
's
hostile
intentions
at
a
not
distant
date
,
a
date
when
an
Englishman
's
home
will
,
alas
!
<EOS>
no
longer
be
his
castle

CHAPTER
V
 
THE
SECRET
OF
THE
NEW
BRITISH
AEROPLANE
  
<EOS>
"
If
we
could
only
approach
the
Military
Ballooning
Department
we
might
,
perhaps
,
learn
something
,
"
I
remarked
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
suppose
that
's
quite
out
of
the
question
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
,
"
declared
Ray
.
<EOS>
"
We
should
receive
no
information
,
and
only
be
laughed
at
for
our
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
think
that
the
new
Kershaw
aeroplane
can
be
the
one
now
being
tried
by
the
Royal
Engineers
with
so
much
secrecy
on
the
Duke
of
Atholl
's
estate
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
"
was
his
prompt
reply
.
<EOS>
"
My
reason
briefly
is
because
I
have
discovered
that
two
Germans
stayed
at
the
Blair
Arms
Hotel
,
at
Blair
Atholl
,
for
six
weeks
last
summer
,
and
then
suddenly
disappeared
--
probably
taking
with
them
the
plans
of
the
airship
about
which
there
has
been
so
much
secrecy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
quite
follow
you
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
there
is
still
another
fact
.
<EOS>
A
month
ago
there
arrived
in
England
a
man
named
Karl
Straus
,
a
lieutenant
of
the
Military
Ballooning
Department
of
the
German
Army
stationed
at
Duesseldorf
.
<EOS>
He
paid
several
visits
to
our
friend
Hartmann
in
Pont
Street
,
and
then
disappeared
from
London
.
<EOS>
Now
,
why
did
he
come
on
a
special
mission
to
England
?
<EOS>
For
one
reason
.
<EOS>
Because
of
the
failure
of
Germany
's
hope
,
the
Zeppelin
airship
,
combined
with
the
report
that
our
new
Kershaw
aeroplane
is
the
most
perfect
of
the
many
inventions
,
and
destined
to
effect
a
revolution
in
warfare
.
<EOS>
The
Kershaw
,
which
was
only
completed
at
South
Farnborough
two
months
ago
,
is
now
being
tried
in
strictest
secrecy
.
<EOS>
Vera
was
told
so
by
an
engineer
officer
she
met
at
a
dance
at
Chatham
a
short
time
ago
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
it
is
being
tried
here
in
the
north
somewhere
,
"
I
added
,
as
together
,
seated
in
a
"
forty
-
eight
Daimler
,
"
we
ascended
Glen
Garry
from
Blair
Atholl
--
which
we
had
left
a
couple
of
hours
before
--
and
sped
along
over
the
wild
,
treeless
Grampians
towards
Dalwhinnie
.
<EOS>
The
March
morning
was
bitterly
cold
,
and
snow
covered
the
ground
,
rendering
the
Highland
scenery
more
picturesque
and
imposing
.
<EOS>
And
as
we
preferred
an
open
car
to
a
closed
one
,
the
journey
was
very
cold
.
 
<EOS>
Our
inquiries
in
Blair
Atholl
had
had
a
negative
result
.
<EOS>
In
the
long
,
old
-
fashioned
Blair
Arms
Hotel
Ray
had
made
a
number
of
searching
inquiries
,
for
though
two
officers
of
the
Ballooning
Department
lived
there
,
and
had
been
conducting
the
experiments
in
Blair
Park
,
it
was
plain
that
the
machine
had
never
yet
taken
flight
.
<EOS>
So
the
pair
of
mysterious
Germans
,
whose
names
we
discovered
in
the
visitors
'
book
,
had
either
obtained
the
details
they
wanted
or
had
left
the
neighbourhood
in
disgust
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
at
my
friend
's
suggestion
that
we
had
hired
the
car
from
Perth
,
and
had
now
set
out
upon
a
tour
of
discovery
in
the
wildest
and
least
frequented
districts
of
the
Highlands
--
some
of
which
are
in
winter
the
most
unfrequented
in
all
Great
Britain
.
<EOS>
Something
--
what
I
know
not
--
had
apparently
convinced
him
that
the
tests
were
still
in
progress
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
where
the
trials
are
taking
place
we
shall
<EOS>
,
I
feel
certain
,
find
this
inquisitive
person
Karl
Straus
,
"
he
declared
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
From
Berlin
,
through
a
confidential
source
,
I
hear
that
it
was
he
who
obtained
the
German
General
Staff
photographs
and
plan
of
the
new
French
aeroplane
that
was
tried
down
in
the
Basque
country
last
May.
<EOS>
He
's
an
expert
aeronaut
and
engineer
,
and
speaks
English
well
;
our
object
is
to
discover
his
whereabouts
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
pursuance
of
this
quest
we
visited
the
various
hotels
on
our
way
north
.
<EOS>
The
"
Loch
Ericht
"
at
Dalwhinnie
we
found
closed
,
therefore
we
went
on
to
Newtonmore
,
and
by
taking
luncheon
at
the
hotel
there
ascertained
that
there
were
no
visitors
who
might
be
either
British
military
officers
or
German
spies
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
gloomy
,
frosty
afternoon
<EOS>
we
,
a
month
after
the
affair
down
at
Maldon
,
sped
up
the
Speyside
through
dark
pine
forests
and
snow
-
covered
moorland
till
we
found
ourselves
in
the
long
grey
street
of
Kingussie
,
where
we
halted
at
the
Star
Hotel
,
a
small
place
with
a
verandah
,
very
popular
in
summer
,
but
in
winter
deserted
.
 
<EOS>
Leaving
me
to
warm
myself
at
the
fire
,
Ray
crossed
to
the
telegraph
office
to
despatch
a
message
,
and
afterwards
I
saw
him
enter
a
small
shop
where
picture
post
-
cards
were
sold
.
<EOS>
For
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
remained
inside
,
and
then
went
to
another
shop
a
few
doors
further
down
.
 
<EOS>
Afterwards
he
rejoined
me
,
and
as
we
remounted
into
the
car
I
saw
that
his
face
wore
a
dark
,
puzzled
expression
.
 
<EOS>
"
Anything
wrong
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
as
we
sped
away
through
the
firs
towards
Loch
Alvie
and
Aviemore
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
Then
,
after
a
pause
,
he
asked
,
"
You
once
used
to
ride
a
motor
-
cycle
,
did
n't
you
,
Jack
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
replied
in
the
affirmative
;
whereupon
he
said
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
hire
one
,
an
observation
which
somewhat
mystified
me
.
<EOS>
And
for
the
next
hour
we
roared
along
over
the
loose
,
uneven
road
through
Aviemore
,
where
the
chief
hotel
was
,
of
course
,
closed
,
and
on
over
Dulnan
Bridge
,
that
paradise
of
the
summer
tourist
;
then
turning
to
the
right
past
the
post
office
,
until
we
were
soon
"
honk
-
honking
"
up
the
wide
main
street
of
Grantown
.
 
<EOS>
Here
in
summer
and
autumn
the
place
is
alive
with
tourists
;
but
in
winter
,
with
its
tearing
winds
and
gusty
snowstorms
,
the
little
place
presents
a
very
different
appearance
.
<EOS>
The
excellent
"
Grant
Arms
,
"
standing
back
from
the
road
at
the
further
end
of
the
town
,
is
,
however
,
one
of
the
few
first
-
class
hotels
in
the
Highlands
open
all
the
year
round
.
<EOS>
And
here
we
put
up
,
both
of
us
glad
to
obtain
shelter
from
the
sleet
which
,
since
the
twilight
had
faded
,
had
been
cutting
our
faces
.
 
<EOS>
While
I
sat
before
the
big
smoking
-
room
fire
with
a
cigarette
,
after
we
had
been
to
our
rooms
to
remove
the
mud
from
our
faces
,
Ray
was
bustling
about
the
hotel
,
eagerly
scanning
the
visitors
'
book
,
among
other
things
.
 
<EOS>
Our
quest
was
a
decidedly
vague
one
,
and
as
I
sat
staring
into
the
flames
I
confess
I
entertained
serious
misgivings
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
went
forth
into
the
hall
to
find
my
friend
,
I
was
told
that
he
had
gone
out
.
 
<EOS>
A
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
returned
,
saying
:
 
"
I
've
seen
a
garage
along
the
street
;
come
with
me
and
hire
a
motor
-
cycle
.
<EOS>
You
'll
probably
want
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wait
and
see
<EOS>
,
"
was
his
response
;
therefore
I
put
on
my
hat
and
coat
and
walked
with
him
to
the
garage
,
about
half
-
way
along
the
street
,
where
I
picked
out
a
good
strong
machine
which
was
duly
wheeled
back
to
the
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
That
night
,
among
the
eight
or
nine
guests
assembled
for
dinner
,
there
was
not
one
who
had
any
resemblance
either
to
a
German
spy
or
an
officer
of
the
Military
Balloon
Factory
at
South
Farnborough
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
days
following
we
used
our
map
well
,
scouring
the
whole
of
the
Spey
side
to
the
Bridge
of
Avon
,
and
on
to
Rothes
,
while
westward
we
drove
by
Carrbridge
,
over
the
Slochd
Mor
to
Loch
Moy
and
across
to
Daviot
.
<EOS>
We
explored
the
steep
hills
of
Cromdale
and
Glen
Tulchan
,
surveyed
the
rugged
country
from
the
summit
of
Carn
Glas
,
and
made
judicious
inquiry
in
all
quarters
,
both
among
village
people
,
shepherds
,
and
others
.
<EOS>
Nowhere
however
could
we
gather
any
information
that
any
trials
of
an
airship
were
in
progress
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
in
leggings
,
mackintosh
,
and
goggles
,
I
went
forth
alone
on
my
motor
-
cycle
,
negotiating
the
rougher
byways
and
making
confidential
inquiry
.
<EOS>
But
the
result
was
ever
a
negative
one
and
always
disheartening
.
 
<EOS>
On
one
occasion
I
had
been
out
alone
and
reached
the
hotel
,
when
,
some
hours
later
,
our
chauffeur
returned
with
the
car
empty
,
and
handed
me
a
hastily
scribbled
note
to
explain
that
Ray
had
left
suddenly
for
the
south
and
instructing
me
to
remain
at
Grantown
till
his
return
.
 
<EOS>
By
that
I
imagined
that
he
had
made
some
discovery
.
<EOS>
Or
had
he
gone
south
to
see
Vera
,
his
well
-
beloved
?
 
<EOS>
Curiously
enough
,
next
day
a
foreigner
--
probably
a
German
--
arrived
at
the
hotel
,
and
,
as
may
be
imagined
,
I
at
once
took
steps
to
keep
him
under
the
strictest
observation
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
quiet
,
apparently
inoffensive
person
about
thirty
-
five
,
who
,
among
his
impedimenta
,
brought
a
motor
-
cycle
and
box
camera
.
<EOS>
Before
he
had
been
in
the
place
<EOS>
twenty
-
four
hours
I
had
convinced
myself
that
he
was
the
spy
Straus
.
 
<EOS>
This
fact
I
wired
to
Bruton
Street
in
the
code
we
had
long
ago
arranged
,
hoping
that
the
message
would
find
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
To
my
surprise
,
all
the
reply
I
got
was
:
"
Be
careful
that
you
have
made
no
mistake
.
"
 
<EOS>
What
could
he
mean
?
<EOS>
I
read
and
re
-
read
the
message
,
but
remained
much
puzzled
,
while
my
excitement
increased
.
 
<EOS>
Each
day
the
new
arrival
,
who
had
written
the
name
of
"
F.
Goldstein
"
in
the
visitors
'
book
,
went
forth
on
his
cycle
to
explore
the
beauties
of
the
Highlands
,
the
thaw
having
now
cleared
the
roads
,
and
on
each
occasion
I
managed
by
dint
of
many
subterfuges
to
watch
his
proceedings
.
<EOS>
His
gaze
was
ever
in
the
distance
,
and
each
time
he
gained
high
ground
he
swept
the
surrounding
country
with
a
pair
of
powerful
prismatic
field
-
glasses
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
<EOS>
I
was
rather
annoyed
at
Ray
's
conduct
in
thus
abandoning
me
at
the
very
moment
of
my
discovery
<EOS>
,
for
here
was
the
ballooning
expert
Straus
bent
upon
seeing
and
photographing
our
newest
arm
of
defence
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
days
passed
I
exerted
every
precaution
,
yet
I
followed
him
everywhere
,
sometimes
using
the
car
,
and
at
others
the
motor
-
cycle
.
 
<EOS>
The
spy
,
a
bespectacled
,
round
-
faced
Teuton
who
spoke
with
a
strong
accent
,
was
ever
active
,
ever
eager
to
discover
something
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
to
my
intense
satisfaction
,
he
seemed
to
be
utterly
unaware
that
I
was
keeping
so
strict
a
watch
upon
his
movements
.
<EOS>
Purposely
I
avoided
speaking
to
him
in
the
hotel
,
for
fear
of
arousing
his
suspicions
.
 
<EOS>
One
day
Mr.
Goldstein
did
not
appear
,
and
in
response
to
my
inquiry
the
waiter
informed
me
that
he
had
caught
cold
and
was
confined
to
his
room
.
 
<EOS>
A
spy
with
a
cold
!
<EOS>
I
laughed
within
myself
,
and
the
afternoon
being
bright
<EOS>
,
I
took
a
run
south
through
the
Abernethy
Forest
down
to
Loch
Pityoulish
.
<EOS>
On
my
return
I
crossed
Dulnan
Bridge
,
where
the
turbulent
Dulnan
River
hurtles
along
over
the
stones
on
its
way
down
to
the
Spey
.
<EOS>
I
dismounted
,
hot
and
tired
,
and
propped
up
my
cycle
against
the
parapet
to
rest
and
admire
the
dark
pine
-
clad
gorge
which
opened
to
the
north
.
 
<EOS>
My
reflections
were
suddenly
cut
short
by
a
loud
humming
sound
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
road
which
I
had
just
traversed
.
<EOS>
Instinctively
I
looked
round
for
the
approaching
motor
-
car
.
<EOS>
The
sound
came
nearer
,
but
instead
of
a
car
,
I
saw
in
the
air
,
above
the
tops
of
the
firs
against
the
distant
hill
in
the
background
,
a
splendid
aeroplane
with
two
men
aboard
.
<EOS>
Swiftly
it
swept
over
the
stream
with
the
ease
and
majesty
of
an
enormous
albatross
!
 
<EOS>
Next
instant
it
had
disappeared
from
my
gaze
.
<EOS>
Yet
in
that
brief
moment
I
had
had
ocular
demonstration
that
the
secret
trials
were
in
progress
in
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
I
waited
on
tiptoe
with
excitement
.
<EOS>
Again
the
whirring
sound
came
nearer
,
the
occupants
of
the
neighbouring
cottages
being
undisturbed
,
believing
it
to
be
a
motor
-
car
.
<EOS>
Once
again
I
saw
the
new
aeroplane
circling
above
the
tree
-
tops
to
the
north
,
after
which
it
turned
suddenly
and
made
off
in
a
bee
-
line
south
,
in
the
direction
<EOS>
whence
I
had
travelled
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
actually
seen
the
new
invention
!
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
,
however
,
had
I
recovered
from
my
surprise
when
I
heard
,
coming
from
the
direction
of
Grantown
,
the
"
pop
-
pop
-
pop
"
of
a
motor
-
cycle
,
and
across
the
bridge
like
a
flash
,
in
the
direction
the
aerial
machine
had
taken
,
came
the
spy
whom
I
had
only
that
morning
left
an
invalid
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
That
evening
,
while
writing
a
letter
in
the
hotel
,
I
had
a
surprise
;
I
was
called
to
the
telephone
,
and
heard
Ray
's
voice
asking
me
to
send
the
car
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
that
he
was
staying
as
Mr.
Charles
Black
at
the
Star
Hotel
in
Kingussie
,
about
twenty
-
eight
miles
distant
,
and
promised
to
come
over
to
see
me
shortly
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
what
I
had
seen
that
afternoon
,
and
how
the
spy
had
been
on
the
alert
,
but
to
my
surprise
he
only
replied
:
 
<EOS>
"
Good
!
<EOS>
Keep
on
the
watch
.
<EOS>
If
what
I
expect
is
true
,
then
we
're
on
a
big
thing
.
<EOS>
Keep
in
touch
with
me
on
the
'
phone
,
and
have
a
continuous
eye
on
your
Mr.
Goldstein
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
replied
that
I
would
,
and
that
our
friend
had
just
returned
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
rang
off
.
 
<EOS>
Why
was
he
at
Kingussie
,
instead
of
assisting
me
?
 
<EOS>
Next
day
I
was
early
astir
,
and
before
luncheon
had
covered
many
miles
on
the
motor
-
cycle
.
<EOS>
Ray
had
not
asked
me
over
to
Kingussie
.
<EOS>
If
he
wanted
me
,
he
would
have
said
so
.
 
<EOS>
Goldstein
had
not
appeared
downstairs
,
therefore
after
luncheon
,
I
went
forth
again
,
taking
the
road
northward
from
Grantown
,
and
just
as
I
was
passing
beneath
the
castellated
railway
-
bridge
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
hotel
<EOS>
,
I
again
suddenly
saw
straight
before
me
the
wonderful
Kershaw
aeroplane
.
<EOS>
The
car
looked
like
a
long
,
thin
cylinder
of
bright
silvery
metal
,
which
I
took
to
be
aluminium
,
and
in
it
I
discerned
two
men
.
 
<EOS>
It
travelled
in
a
circle
several
times
over
the
tree
-
tops
,
and
then
,
just
as
at
Dulnan
Bridge
,
it
dived
straight
away
over
the
dark
pine
forest
towards
the
lonely
moors
of
Cromdale
.
<EOS>
Without
a
second
's
hesitation
I
mounted
and
rode
full
speed
after
her
,
keeping
her
well
in
sight
as
I
went
towards
Deva
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
scarcely
had
I
gone
half
a
mile
when
I
again
heard
behind
me
the
"
pop
-
pop
-
pop
"
of
another
cycle
,
and
turning
<EOS>
,
saw
to
my
satisfaction
the
man
Goldstein
,
who
had
evidently
seen
the
aeroplane
,
and
was
now
bent
upon
obtaining
all
details
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Going
up
the
hill
I
drew
away
from
him
,
but
as
we
descended
he
passed
me
,
and
in
order
to
pose
as
an
excited
onlooker
,
I
shouted
to
him
my
surprise
in
seeing
such
an
apparatus
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
He
evidently
knew
more
of
the
new
invention
than
I
did
.
<EOS>
And
yet
Ray
held
aloof
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
,
having
been
out
for
a
stroll
,
I
returned
to
the
hotel
about
noon
,
when
a
few
moments
later
my
friend
entered
the
reading
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
's
go
to
your
room
<EOS>
,
"
he
suggested
;
therefore
we
ascended
the
stairs
,
and
I
opened
the
door
with
my
key
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
had
done
so
,
he
made
a
swift
tour
of
the
apartment
,
examining
both
the
carpet
and
the
red
plush
-
covered
chairs
without
uttering
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room
for
a
moment
,
and
slowly
selected
a
cigarette
from
his
case
.
<EOS>
Ray
Raymond
was
thinking
--
thinking
deeply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
friend
Goldstein
has
a
visitor
,
"
he
remarked
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
to
my
knowledge
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
occupies
room
No
.
11
in
this
hotel
,
"
he
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
16
,
therefore
he
must
be
quite
near
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
who
's
the
visitor
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
friend
of
Goldstein
's
.
<EOS>
Downstairs
you
can
discover
his
name
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
descended
and
found
that
on
the
previous
evening
there
had
certainly
arrived
at
the
hotel
a
Mr.
William
Smith
,
who
occupied
room
<EOS>
No
.
11
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
was
Ray
aware
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
returned
to
my
room
,
and
found
him
staring
out
of
the
window
into
the
roadway
below
.
<EOS>
I
saw
that
he
was
unusually
agitated
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Jack
,
"
he
said
,
turning
to
me
when
I
told
him
the
name
of
the
occupant
of
No
.
11
,
"
how
horribly
stuffy
this
room
is
!
<EOS>
Do
you
never
have
the
window
open
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
I
said
,
crossing
to
open
it
as
usual
.
<EOS>
But
I
found
that
it
had
been
jammed
down
tightly
,
and
that
felt
had
been
placed
in
the
crevices
by
the
hotel
people
to
exclude
the
draught
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
noticed
it
,
and
a
curious
smile
crossed
his
aquiline
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
remove
all
that
,
if
I
were
you
,
"
he
exclaimed
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
'd
also
pull
out
all
that
stuffing
<EOS>
I
see
up
the
chimney
.
<EOS>
You
never
have
a
fire
here
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hate
a
fire
in
my
bedroom
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
But
what
has
that
to
do
with
our
friend
Goldstein
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
good
deal
,
"
was
his
reply
.
<EOS>
"
Take
my
advice
and
have
a
fire
here
;
"
and
by
his
look
I
saw
that
he
had
discovered
more
than
he
wished
at
that
juncture
to
tell
me
.
<EOS>
Had
I
known
the
astounding
truth
,
I
certainly
should
not
have
taken
his
words
so
calmly
.
 
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
evince
an
interest
in
my
room
,
its
position
and
its
contents
,
but
when
I
remarked
upon
it
he
pretended
unconcern
.
<EOS>
He
rang
the
bell
and
inquired
of
the
waiter
for
Mr.
Goldstein
and
Mr.
William
Smith
,
but
the
man
informed
him
that
both
gentlemen
were
out
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
"
added
the
waiter
,
"
that
Mr.
Goldstein
is
leaving
us
this
evening
or
to
-
morrow
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Leaving
!
"
<EOS>
I
echoed
as
soon
as
the
man
had
closed
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
follow
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
It
really
is
n't
worth
while
,
"
Ray
replied
,
"
at
least
not
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
Remain
here
and
have
a
care
of
yourself
,
Jack
.
"
 
<EOS>
What
did
he
mean
?
<EOS>
We
ate
a
hasty
lunch
,
and
then
,
mounting
into
the
car
,
my
companion
ordered
the
chauffeur
to
drive
south
again
past
Dulnan
Bridge
to
Duthil
,
where
we
turned
up
to
the
right
and
ascended
the
thickly
wooded
hill
of
Lochgorm
on
that
stony
road
that
leads
out
upon
the
desolate
Muirs
of
Cromdale
.
<EOS>
After
we
had
cleared
the
wood
he
ordered
the
man
to
pull
up
,
for
the
road
was
so
bad
.
<EOS>
Descending
,
we
climbed
the
steep
ascent
to
the
summit
of
a
hill
,
where
,
after
sweeping
the
surrounding
country
with
a
small
pair
of
powerful
glasses
I
carried
,
I
at
last
discerned
the
aeroplane
heading
westward
some
ten
miles
distant
.
 
<EOS>
Unfortunately
,
however
,
the
clouds
came
down
upon
us
,
and
we
quickly
found
ourselves
enveloped
in
a
gradually
thickening
Scotch
mist
,
while
the
aeroplane
,
soon
but
a
faint
grey
shadow
,
quickly
faded
from
our
gaze
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
Raymond
was
ever
a
dogged
person
.
<EOS>
He
decided
to
descend
,
and
this
we
did
,
passing
over
the
other
side
of
the
hill
for
half
an
hour
,
progress
of
course
being
slow
on
account
of
the
clouds
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
a
puff
of
cold
wind
came
up
out
of
the
east
,
and
patches
of
dun
-
coloured
moorland
began
to
appear
below
through
the
rents
of
the
fast
-
breaking
clouds
;
when
presently
our
watchful
eyes
caught
the
dull
leaden
gleam
of
a
sheet
of
water
about
three
miles
ahead
,
which
a
look
at
my
map
enabled
me
to
recognise
as
Lochindorb
.
 
<EOS>
And
just
as
we
were
able
to
locate
the
spot
we
again
saw
the
big
white
-
winged
aeroplane
as
she
swooped
down
to
the
surface
of
the
loch
,
upon
which
she
floated
swanlike
and
majestic
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
I
asked
,
turning
and
looking
him
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Jack
,
I
've
seen
it
in
flight
just
as
you
have
,
"
he
said
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
've
never
yet
approached
it
.
<EOS>
I
've
had
reasons
for
keeping
away
.
<EOS>
After
to
-
day
,
however
,
there
is
no
longer
much
necessity
for
hesitation
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
follow
you
,
old
chap
,
"
I
declared
,
my
eyes
still
fixed
through
the
glasses
upon
the
aeroplane
sailing
along
the
surface
of
the
distant
lake
.
 
<EOS>
"
Probably
not
,
"
he
laughed
,
"
but
you
'll
see
the
motive
of
my
actions
before
a
few
days
are
over
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
Let
's
go
back
.
"
<EOS>
And
returning
to
the
car
he
carried
me
as
far
as
the
entrance
to
Grantown
,
where
he
deposited
me
,
and
then
turning
,
ordered
the
man
to
drive
with
all
speed
back
to
Kingussie
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
re
-
entered
my
comfortable
hotel
<EOS>
I
learnt
that
Goldstein
had
left
by
the
afternoon
train
for
the
south
.
<EOS>
My
interest
therefore
lay
in
the
new
arrival
in
No
.
11
,
but
though
I
waited
up
till
midnight
,
he
did
not
return
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
I
was
returning
to
bed
I
made
a
curious
discovery
in
my
room
.
<EOS>
Running
from
the
top
of
the
high
,
old
-
fashioned
mahogany
wardrobe
,
with
its
heavily
ornamented
cornice
,
was
a
long
piece
of
strong
,
black
cord
,
which
,
passing
down
the
side
panel
,
was
placed
close
to
the
wainscoting
,
so
as
to
avoid
notice
,
the
end
being
placed
beneath
the
mat
outside
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
At
once
I
suspected
a
practical
joke
,
but
on
mounting
one
of
the
old
-
fashioned
chairs
,
I
looked
along
the
top
of
the
wardrobe
,
but
discerned
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
gathered
up
the
piece
of
cord
,
held
it
in
my
hand
with
curiosity
for
a
few
moments
,
and
then
wondering
who
had
any
object
in
playing
such
a
prank
,
turned
in
and
slept
soundly
till
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
scarcely
sat
down
to
breakfast
in
the
small
upstairs
coffee
-
room
--
which
is
used
in
winter
--
when
I
was
summoned
to
the
telephone
,
where
Ray
predicted
that
the
mysterious
Mr.
Smith
would
soon
return
,
and
if
he
did
,
I
was
to
betray
no
interest
in
him
whatsoever
,
and
above
all
,
avoid
any
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
Such
instructions
mystified
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
not
long
to
wait
for
the
return
of
the
man
who
called
himself
Smith
,
for
he
arrived
just
as
it
was
growing
dusk
.
 
<EOS>
After
dinner
I
was
seated
in
front
of
the
blazing
fire
in
my
room
,
smoking
and
reading
the
_
Courier
_
,
when
I
heard
a
man
in
heavy
boots
pass
my
door
,
and
recognised
his
low
,
hacking
cough
as
that
of
the
occupant
of
No
.
11
.
 
<EOS>
I
opened
the
door
,
and
peering
forth
saw
that
he
was
dressed
in
his
loose
mackintosh
and
cap
and
carried
a
stout
stick
.
<EOS>
He
was
going
forth
for
a
night
walk
!
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
slipped
on
my
thick
boots
and
coat
and
followed
.
<EOS>
He
had
turned
to
the
right
on
leaving
the
hotel
,
but
in
the
silence
of
the
night
it
was
difficult
,
nay
,
almost
impossible
,
to
watch
his
movements
unobserved
.
 
<EOS>
For
about
two
miles
I
went
forward
,
following
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
in
the
dark
night
in
the
direction
of
Dava
Moor
,
until
we
entered
the
forest
of
Glaschoile
,
where
the
footsteps
suddenly
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
I
halted
to
listen
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
dead
silence
.
<EOS>
The
man
had
realised
that
he
was
being
followed
,
and
had
plunged
into
the
forest
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
disappointed
,
I
was
compelled
to
retrace
my
steps
to
the
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
I
tried
to
telephone
to
Ray
,
but
was
told
that
late
the
previous
night
he
had
gone
out
on
the
car
and
had
not
returned
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
remained
there
,
impatient
and
helpless
,
the
mysterious
Smith
being
still
absent
.
 
<EOS>
At
three
o'clock
that
afternoon
the
car
pulled
up
before
the
door
and
Ray
descended
.
 
<EOS>
"
Put
on
your
coat
and
come
with
me
,
"
he
said
briefly
.
<EOS>
And
a
few
minutes
later
we
were
tearing
along
over
the
same
road
which
the
mysterious
Smith
had
taken
in
the
darkness
--
the
direct
road
which
leads
north
by
way
of
Dava
,
away
to
Forres
.
 
<EOS>
Just
past
the
little
school
house
of
Dava
we
left
the
main
road
,
and
striking
across
the
wide
,
bleak
,
snow
-
covered
moor
for
about
a
mile
,
suddenly
came
into
view
of
a
wide
and
lonely
expanse
of
dark
water
in
the
centre
of
the
desolate
landscape
.
<EOS>
It
was
Lochindorb
,
where
,
in
the
distance
,
we
had
seen
the
Kershaw
aeroplane
alight
and
sail
along
the
surface
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
reached
the
edge
of
the
loch
I
saw
out
upon
a
small
islet
in
the
centre
a
ruined
castle
,
a
long
,
almost
unbroken
,
grey
wall
of
uniform
height
,
without
turrets
or
battlements
,
occupying
the
whole
of
the
islet
.
<EOS>
Below
the
walls
a
few
bushes
grew
from
the
water
's
edge
,
but
it
was
as
dreary
and
isolated
a
spot
as
I
had
ever
seen
.
<EOS>
Beyond
stretched
the
big
,
dull
sheet
of
water
,
backed
only
by
the
low
,
uninteresting
moorland
,
the
only
break
in
the
all
-
pervading
flatness
and
monotony
being
afforded
by
a
few
wind
-
stunted
trees
on
the
right
of
the
road
,
and
a
small
dark
plantation
ahead
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
car
had
stopped
and
we
had
got
out
and
walked
a
few
yards
,
Ray
said
:
 
"
Yonder
is
the
old
castle
of
Lochindorb
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
Behind
those
walls
is
the
shed
which
shelters
the
Kershaw
aeroplane
.
<EOS>
Look
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
gazing
in
the
direction
he
indicated
,
I
saw
a
skiff
with
three
occupants
coming
across
from
the
shadows
on
the
left
towards
the
island
.
<EOS>
The
man
steering
was
a
corporal
of
engineers
in
khaki
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
appears
,
"
Ray
went
on
,
"
that
the
machine
takes
her
flight
from
the
open
surface
of
the
loch
,
which
,
as
you
see
,
is
about
two
miles
long
.
<EOS>
She
enters
and
leaves
the
shed
by
water
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
we
were
speaking
,
a
bearded
gillie
of
gigantic
stature
came
up
from
nowhere
and
promptly
ordered
us
away
,
an
order
which
we
were
very
reluctantly
compelled
to
obey
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
however
,
we
had
discovered
the
obscure
spot
where
the
secret
trials
were
in
progress
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
from
the
first
that
the
tests
must
be
in
progress
in
this
district
,
"
Ray
said
,
"
for
a
month
ago
that
motor
engineer
in
Grantown
of
whom
you
hired
your
cycle
made
a
small
part
of
a
new
motor
for
a
man
who
was
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
The
part
was
broken
,
and
the
stranger
ordered
another
to
be
made
.
<EOS>
I
learnt
that
the
first
night
we
were
in
Grantown
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
resolved
to
spend
that
night
at
Grantown
,
therefore
we
dined
together
,
and
when
we
rose
from
table
he
went
to
his
room
in
order
to
obtain
his
pipe
.

Ten
minutes
later
he
returned
,
saying
:
 
"
Just
come
with
me
for
a
moment
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
rose
and
followed
.
 
<EOS>
We
ascended
the
stairs
,
and
passing
along
the
corridor
he
halted
before
the
door
of
No
.
11
and
tapped
at
it
quietly
.
 
<EOS>
It
opened
,
and
Smith
stood
upon
the
threshold
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
speak
with
you
a
moment
,
"
Ray
said
,
facing
him
determinedly
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
's
face
fell
.
<EOS>
We
both
entered
,
but
so
surprised
was
he
that
he
could
utter
no
protest
.
 
<EOS>
We
saw
that
on
the
table
beneath
the
lamp
was
spread
a
number
of
photographs
and
papers
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
writing
upon
a
sheet
of
foolscap
and
the
writing
was
in
German
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
exclaimed
Ray
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
as
he
bent
over
to
glance
at
the
first
few
lines
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
.
<EOS>
You
report
:
'
The

'
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
my
business
to
do
with
you
,
pray
?
"
<EOS>
the
man
asked
defiantly
in
excellent
English
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
your
business
has
interested
me
greatly
,
Herr
Straus
,
"
calmly
replied
my
companion
,
"
and
I
congratulate
you
upon
the
ingenious
method
by
which
you
got
a
sight
of
the
Kershaw
aeroplane
at
an
early
hour
this
morning
.
<EOS>
I
was
at
Lochindorb
with
you
--
and
rather
cold
waiting
,
was
n't
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
man
now
recognised
gave
vent
to
a
quick
imprecation
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
've
just
developed
that
photograph
you
took
in
secret
as
she
sailed
within
twenty
yards
of
you
!
<EOS>
But
I
shall
trouble
you
to
give
it
over
to
me
,
together
with
the
rough
sketch
I
see
,
and
your
written
description
of
our
new
military
invention
,
"
he
said
,
with
mock
politeness
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
you
--
and
I
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
,
Karl
Straus
,
as
a
spy
of
Germany
,
"
exclaimed
my
friend
,
with
a
grin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
reputation
for
ingenuity
and
cunning
reached
us
from
France
"
;
and
snatching
up
the
sheet
of
foolscap
he
turned
to
me
,
saying
,
"
Listen
to
this
,
Jack
,
"
and
while
the
German
agent
stood
biting
his
lips
in
chagrin
at
being
discovered
at
the
eleventh
hour
,
my
friend
read
aloud
the
spy
's
report
,
as
follows
:
      
<EOS>
"
The
upper
plane
of
the
Kershaw
aeroplane
is
somewhat
curved
,
     
with
an
upward
curve
at
the
front
.
<EOS>
The
side
planes
are
composed
     
of
a
light
framework
covered
with
a
number
of
small
squares
of
     
some
light
material
,
each
stretched
on
a
light
frame
hinged
to
     
the
main
frame
at
the
rear
end
of
each
.
<EOS>
To
the
front
end
is
     
fastened
a
strong
silken
cord
.
<EOS>
These
cords
are
all
fastened
at
     
their
lower
ends
to
a
large
ring
.
<EOS>
To
this
is
attached
a
wire
     
rope
,
which
passes
over
a
pulley
-
wheel
at
the
end
of
a
species
     
of
outrigger
,
and
thence
into
the
cigar
-
like
body
of
the
car
.
     
<EOS>
From
what
I
have
observed
when
the
machine
is
in
flight
,
it
is
     
evident
to
me
that
the
steersman
(
who
sits
at
the
fore
part
of
     
the
car
)
is
able
to
manipulate
these
by
means
of
levers
,
<EOS>
so
     
that
the
numerous
flaps
forming
the
surface
of
the
side
planes
     
can
be
opened
and
closed
at
will
.
      
<EOS>
"
Thus
suppose
the
machine
to
be
diving
;
slackening
these
ropes
,
     
the
pressure
of
the
air
underneath
causes
the
flaps
to
open
.
<EOS>
As
     
soon
as
this
happens
their
inclination
upwards
tends
to
make
     
the
machine
rise
so
long
as
the
propellers
are
driving
her
     
forward
,
the
angle
of
ascent
being
controlled
by
the
angle
to
     
which
they
are
allowed
to
open
.
<EOS>
If
the
machine
inclines
to
lean
     
over
to
right
or
left
,
the
opening
and
closing
of
the
flaps
on
one
     
side
or
the
other
can
be
used
to
counteract
it
and
restore
the
     
balance
.
<EOS>
With
all
kept
tightly
closed
<EOS>
she
can
go
forward
or
dive
.
     
<EOS>
With
them
open
,
and
engines
stopped
,
she
dives
quickly
.
<EOS>
The
rudder
     
is
of
box
-
kite
form
,
and
fastened
to
the
after
end
of
the
     
cigar
-
like
car
,
which
apparently
contains
the
engines
,
petrol
     
tanks
,
etc
.
,
and
enough
air
space
to
render
the
machine
buoyant
     
when
water
-
borne
.
<EOS>
The
propellers
,
which
are
placed
on
hollow
     
shafts
,
whose
bearings
are
supported
on
horizontal
braces
     
between
the
two
V
-
shaped
aluminium
lattice
girders
attaching
     
the
planes
to
the
car
,
are
driven
by
separate
endless
chains
,
     
which
come
up
out
of
the
centre
of
the
cylinder
.
<EOS>
They
seem
to
     
be
made
either
of
aluminium
,
or
more
probably
magnalium
.
      
<EOS>
"
My
drawing
has
rather
exaggerated
the
diameter
of
the
cylindrical
     
car
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
light
wooden
foot
-
board
at
either
side
,
which
also
     
helps
to
steady
the
machine
when
on
the
water
and
two
small
floats
     
at
the
end
of
the
outriggers
for
the
same
purpose
.
<EOS>
There
are
also
     
three
small
wheels
fitted
,
I
presume
for
facilitating
ascent
from
     
dry
ground
.

KARL
STRAUS
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
spy
laughed
a
low
,
hollow
laugh
of
defiance
.
<EOS>
What
could
he
say
?
<EOS>
He
had
been
outwitted
just
at
the
supreme
moment
of
his
success
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
admit
,
my
friend
,
that
you
were
extremely
clever
in
putting
forward
Goldstein
as
the
spy
,
and
thus
misleading
my
friend
Jacox
,
"
Ray
said
in
triumph
,
as
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
rough
sketch
of
the
Kershaw
invention
.
<EOS>
"
But
for
a
very
timely
discovery
,
too
,
my
friend
would
have
met
with
the
terrible
fate
which
you
and
your
accomplice
planned
with
such
devilish
ingenuity
.
<EOS>
So
if
you
do
n't
wish
to
be
arrested
for
conspiracy
and
murder
you
'd
better
make
yourself
scarce
out
of
England
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
Ray
?
<EOS>
"
I
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
show
you
,
"
he
answered
as
he
gathered
up
the
whole
of
the
spy
's
papers
while
the
German
stood
helpless
.
"
<EOS>
Come
along
to
your
room
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
When
inside
he
pointed
to
the
old
red
-
plush
-
covered
chairs
,
and
said
:
 
"
Do
you
recollect
my
arrival
after
Straus
's
visit
?
<EOS>
I
examined
those
chairs
,
and
saw
upon
one
the
traces
of
chalk
.
<EOS>
The
shoes
of
the
occupant
of
room
<EOS>
No
.
11
had
been
chalked
by
the
boots
with
his
number
,
and
upon
the
chair
I
saw
traces
,
and
knew
that
he
had
stood
there
to
gain
the
top
of
your
wardrobe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
what
reason
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
For
answer
he
turned
up
the
gas
and
pointed
to
the
cornice
of
the
ceiling
behind
the
wardrobe
,
where
I
saw
that
upon
the
leaden
gas
-
pipe
running
along
it
was
a
long
,
narrow
strip
of
what
looked
like
paper
which
had
been
pasted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Those
men
meant
to
kill
you
,
Jack
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
On
the
morning
I
came
here
Straus
had
entered
,
climbed
up
to
the
gas
-
pipe
,
and
with
his
clasp
-
knife
cut
a
hole
in
it
.
<EOS>
Over
that
he
,
as
you
see
,
placed
several
thicknesses
of
medical
plaster
,
attaching
to
it
a
piece
of
strong
black
cord
,
and
carrying
it
outside
the
door
.
<EOS>
After
that
they
plugged
up
your
window
and
chimney
,
so
that
when
you
were
asleep
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
just
pull
the
string
,
which
would
strip
off
the
plaster
,
allow
the
gas
to
escape
into
the
room
,
and
thus
asphyxiate
you
.
<EOS>
The
plaster
could
be
dragged
beneath
the
door
into
the
passage
outside
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Great
heavens
!
<EOS>
"
I
gasped
,
staring
astounded
at
the
white
medical
plaster
on
the
gas
-
pipe
along
the
cornice
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
narrow
escape
I
've
had
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
While
I
was
in
London
,
Vera
went
up
with
her
maid
and
stayed
at
the
'
Star
'
at
Kingussie
,
where
she
overheard
the
two
men
in
conversation
,
and
learnt
the
clever
trick
they
were
playing
with
Goldstein
as
the
spy
.
<EOS>
She
suspected
that
they
intended
to
rid
themselves
of
your
unwelcome
surveillance
,
and
returned
at
once
to
me
in
London
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
I
discovered
the
dastardly
plot
,
and
that
morning
I
cut
the
cord
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
fellow
Straus
is
a
much
more
desperate
character
than
he
looks
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
But
we
'll
just
go
back
and
<EOS>
you
can
tell
him
your
opinion
of
him
,
"
he
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
We
went
together
along
to
No
.
11
.
<EOS>
The
spy
had
already
left
,
but
ascending
the
stairs
was
Vera
,
in
a
long
travelling
-
coat
,
her
maid
following
with
the
wraps
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
just
arrived
from
London
,
and
after
she
had
greeted
us
in
her
usual
merry
manner
,
told
us
that
she
was
the
bearer
of
very
important
news
--
news
of
the
activity
of
spies
in
another
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
We
quickly
told
her
how
we
had
managed
to
outwit
Straus
,
while
I
,
on
my
part
,
thanked
her
warmly
for
having
made
that
startling
discovery
which
had
,
no
doubt
,
saved
me
from
falling
a
victim
to
that
dastardly
plot
formed
by
one
of
the
most
ingenious
of
the
many
unscrupulous
spies
of
the
Kaiser

CHAPTER
VI
 
<EOS>
THE
SECRET
OF
THE
NEW
ARMOUR
-
PLATES
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
if
that
fellow
is
aware
of
his
danger
?
"
<EOS>
remarked
Ray
,
speaking
to
himself
behind
the
paper
he
was
reading
before
the
fire
in
New
Stone
Buildings
,
one
afternoon
not
long
after
we
had
returned
from
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
fellow
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
Professor
Emden
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
It
seems
that
in
a
lecture
at
the
London
Institution
last
night
,
he
announced
that
he
had
discovered
a
new
process
for
the
hardening
of
steel
,
which
gives
it
no
less
than
eight
times
the
resisting
power
of
the
present
English
steel
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
I
asked
,
looking
across
at
my
friend
,
and
then
glancing
at
Vera
,
who
had
called
and
was
seated
with
us
,
her
hat
still
on
,
and
a
charming
figure
to
boot
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
fellow
,
ca
n't
you
see
that
such
an
invention
would
be
of
the
utmost
value
to
our
friends
the
Germans
?
<EOS>
They
'd
use
it
for
the
armour
-
plates
of
their
new
navy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
H'm
!
<EOS>
And
you
suspect
they
'll
try
and
obtain
Emden
's
secret
--
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suspect
,
I
'm
confident
of
it
,
"
he
declared
,
throwing
aside
the
paper
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
's
a
bespectacled
,
unsuspicious
man
,
like
all
scientists
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
The
Times
<EOS>
_
is
enthusiastic
over
the
discovery
--
declaring
that
the
Admiralty
should
secure
it
at
once
,
if
they
have
not
already
done
so
.
<EOS>
It
's
being
made
experimentally
at
Sheffield
,
it
seems
,
and
has
been
tried
in
secret
somewhere
out
near
the
Orkneys
.
<EOS>
Admiralty
experts
are
astounded
at
the
results
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
Emden
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
look
at
<EOS>
'
Who
's
Who
?
'
<EOS>
It
's
by
your
elbow
,
old
chap
.

<EOS>
Ray
proceeded
to
search
the
fat
red
book
of
reference
,
and
presently
exclaimed
:
 
<EOS>
"
It
seems
he
's
a
Fellow
of
the
Royal
Society
,
a
very
distinguished
chemist
,
and
a
leading
authority
on
electro
-
metallurgy
and
ferro
-
alloys
.
<EOS>
He
has
improved
upon
the
Kjellin
furnace
as
installed
at
Krupp
's
at
Essen
,
and
at
Vickers
,
Sons
,
and
Maxim
's
at
Sheffield
,
and
by
this
improvement
,
it
seems
,
has
been
able
to
invent
the
new
steel
-
making
process
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
he
has
improved
upon
any
of
the
machinery
or
processes
at
the
Krupp
works
,
"
remarked
Vera
,
glancing
across
at
me
,
"
then
,
no
doubt
,
our
friends
across
the
North
Sea
will
endeavour
to
filch
the
secret
from
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
agreed
,
"
he
certainly
ought
to
be
warned
of
his
danger
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Hartmann
sees
the
announcement
in
the
papers
,
there
's
certain
to
be
a
desperate
attempt
to
get
hold
of
the
secret
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
must
n't
be
allowed
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
Ray
exclaimed
.
"
<EOS>
With
such
steel
as
this
the
British
Navy
will
have
a
splendid
and
distinct
advantage
over
that
of
our
friend
'
William
the
Sudden
.
'
<EOS>
This
is
a
great
and
important
secret
which
England
must
keep
at
all
hazards
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
declared
Vera
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Really
,
Ray
,
you
ought
to
see
Professor
Emden
and
have
a
chat
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
address
is
given
at
Richmond
,
"
was
my
friend
's
reply
,
"
but
I
have
to
go
up
to
Selkirk
early
to
-
morrow
,
and
shall
be
away
nearly
a
week
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
shall
I
run
down
and
see
him
this
evening
?
<EOS>
"
I
suggested
.
<EOS>
And
agreeing
with
my
idea
,
he
wrote
the
address
for
me
.
<EOS>
Then
we
made
a
cup
of
tea
for
Vera
,
who
always
delighted
in
the
rough
-
and
-
ready
bachelordom
of
a
barrister
's
chambers
.
<EOS>
Afterwards
Ray
took
his
fiancee
home
to
her
aunt
's
,
while
I
went
back
to
my
rather
dismal
lodgings
in
Guilford
Street
,
Russell
Square
.
 
<EOS>
At
nine
o'clock
that
evening
I
rang
at
a
pleasant
,
good
-
sized
,
modern
house
,
which
overlooked
the
beautiful
Terrace
Gardens
and
the
river
lying
deep
below
at
Richmond
--
a
house
which
,
perhaps
,
commanded
the
finest
view
within
twenty
miles
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
was
upon
that
main
road
which
leads
from
the
town
up
to
the
"
Star
and
Garter
,
"
but
the
frontage
faced
the
Gardens
.
<EOS>
The
dark
-
eyed
maid
who
opened
the
door
informed
me
that
the
Professor
was
at
home
,
and
took
my
card
upstairs
.
<EOS>
Then
,
a
few
moments
later
,
I
was
ushered
up
to
a
cosy
den
,
the
study
of
a
studious
man
,
where
I
found
the
distinguished
scientist
standing
in
expectation
,
with
his
back
to
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
strange
-
looking
man
of
sixty
-
five
,
his
hair
unusually
white
and
slightly
bald
on
top
.
<EOS>
Tall
beyond
the
average
,
he
wore
a
moustache
and
slight
pointed
beard
,
while
his
countenance
seemed
very
broad
in
the
forehead
tapering
to
a
point
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
,
indeed
,
almost
grotesque
.
 
<EOS>
I
commenced
by
apologising
for
my
intrusion
,
but
explained
that
I
had
called
on
a
purely
confidential
matter
.
<EOS>
When
the
door
was
closed
,
and
we
were
alone
,
I
said
:
 
"
<EOS>
My
mission
,
Professor
,
is
a
somewhat
curious
one
"
;
and
I
went
on
to
explain
our
fears
that
German
secret
agents
might
obtain
knowledge
of
the
new
process
to
which
he
had
referred
at
the
London
Institution
on
the
previous
night
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
moment
he
stroked
his
pointed
white
beard
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
I
detected
that
he
was
as
eccentric
as
he
was
curious
-
looking
.
<EOS>
Then
,
with
a
light
laugh
,
he
replied
:
 
"
Really
Mr.--Mr
.
<EOS>
Jacox
,
I
ca
n't
see
your
motive
,
or
that
of
your
friends
,
in
thus
interfering
in
my
private
affairs
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
is
not
this
splendid
discovery
of
yours
of
national
importance
?
<EOS>
"
I
protested
.
<EOS>
"
Will
it
not
give
us
an
enormous
advantage
over
our
enemies
?
<EOS>
Therefore
,
is
it
not
more
than
probable
that
you
have
already
attracted
the
attention
of
these
spies
of
Germany
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sir
,
"
he
laughed
,
"
I
tell
you
quite
frankly
that
I
do
n't
believe
in
all
these
stories
about
German
spies
.
<EOS>
What
is
there
in
England
for
Germany
to
discover
?
<EOS>
Nothing
;
they
know
everything
.
<EOS>
No
,
Mr.
Jacox
,
I
'm
an
Englishman
,
a
patriot
,
and
I
still
believe
in
England
's
power
.
<EOS>
We
have
nothing
whatever
to
fear
from
Germany
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
theory
is
hardly
borne
out
by
facts
,
Professor
,
"
I
said
,
proceeding
to
tell
him
of
our
discovery
at
Rosyth
,
and
how
we
had
outwitted
the
spies
regarding
the
new
submarine
,
and
also
the
airship
at
Lochindorb
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
strange
-
looking
old
scientist
,
distinguished
as
he
was
,
only
laughed
my
fears
to
scorn
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
like
to
see
any
German
trying
to
learn
my
secret
,
"
he
said
defiantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
would
urge
you
to
take
every
precaution
.
<EOS>
These
agents
employed
by
the
German
Secret
Police
on
behalf
of
the
General
Staff
are
bold
and
unscrupulous
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
allege
that
there
are
actually
German
spies
in
England
?
"
asked
the
strange
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Most
certainly
.
<EOS>
We
have
in
England
and
Scotland
more
than
five
thousand
fixed
agents
,
men
of
almost
every
nationality
except
German
,
and
in
every
walk
of
life
,
from
humble
labourers
to
men
and
women
in
good
positions
,
all
of
whom
are
collecting
information
at
the
order
of
the
German
travelling
agents
,
who
visit
them
from
time
to
time
,
collect
their
reports
,
and
pay
them
their
salaries
.
<EOS>
French
,
Swiss
,
and
Italians
are
mostly
employed
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
At
the
present
time
my
friend
Raymond
has
under
observation
a
German
band
,
seven
young
fellows
all
army
officers
,
who
are
playing
in
the
streets
of
Leeds
,
and
at
the
same
time
making
a
secret
map
of
the
water
-
mains
of
that
city
,
in
order
that
when
'
the
Day
'
of
invasion
comes
,
the
enemy
will
be
able
to
suddenly
deprive
a
densely
populated
area
of
water
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
have
you
any
actual
proof
of
this
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
the
door
opened
,
and
there
entered
a
pretty
dark
-
haired
girl
of
twenty
-
two
,
wearing
a
light
skirt
and
a
pale
pink
evening
blouse
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dad
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
halting
suddenly
,
"
I
'm
sorry
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
you
had
a
visitor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
sha
n't
be
a
moment
,
Nella
dear
,
"
the
curious
-
looking
old
man
said
,
and
after
a
quick
,
inquisitive
glance
at
me
the
girl
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
exclaimed
the
Professor
,
with
a
smile
,
"
I
'm
really
very
obliged
to
you
for
troubling
to
come
here
to
warn
me
,
but
<EOS>
I
think
,
my
dear
sir
,
that
warnings
are
quite
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
the
slightest
fear
that
any
attempt
will
ever
be
made
to
secure
my
secret
"
;
and
he
rose
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
I
replied
,
shrugging
my
shoulders
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
warned
you
,
Professor
Emden
.
<EOS>
The
Government
will
not
admit
the
presence
of
spies
amongst
us
,
and
for
that
reason
we
are
now
collecting
indisputable
evidence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
laughed
,
"
and
you
want
me
to
help
you
,
eh
?
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
I
do
n't
believe
in
a
word
of
this
scare
--
so
I
must
decline
that
honour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
take
no
unusual
precaution
to
keep
the
truth
out
of
the
hands
of
our
enemies
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
leave
it
to
Joynson
's
of
Sheffield
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
They
've
paid
me
a
large
sum
down
and
a
royalty
for
the
secret
of
my
process
,
and
it
is
scarcely
likely
that
they
'll
allow
it
to
fall
into
other
hands
,
is
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
will
not
,
but
you
,
a
private
individual
,
may
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
"
he
laughed
,
and
a
moment
later
I
descended
the
stairs
,
passing
his
pretty
daughter
Nella
on
the
way
out
.
 
<EOS>
That
night
I
called
on
Ray
at
Bruton
Street
,
but
he
was
out
at
the
theatre
with
Vera
.
<EOS>
At
half
-
past
eleven
they
called
as
they
went
back
to
the
girl
's
aunt
's
,
and
as
they
sat
before
the
fire
,
Vera
with
her
opera
-
cloak
thrown
back
revealing
a
pretty
pale
blue
corsage
a
trifle
<EOS>
_
decollete
_
<EOS>
,
I
reported
the
non
-
success
of
my
mission
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
pig
-
headed
old
ass
!
<EOS>
"
I
declared
.
<EOS>
"
One
of
millions
of
others
in
England
.
<EOS>
They
close
their
eyes
to
the
dangers
of
this
horde
of
spies
among
us
,
and
will
only
open
them
when
the
Germans
come
marching
up
the
street
and
billet
themselves
in
their
houses
.
<EOS>
But
he
's
a
strange
man
,
Ray
,
a
very
strange
man
,
"
I
added
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
right
,
Mr.
Jacox
,
"
the
girl
declared
.
"
<EOS>
Instead
of
teaching
boys
how
to
scout
and
instructing
young
men
in
the
use
of
popguns
,
we
should
strike
first
at
the
root
of
all
things
.
<EOS>
Cut
off
the
source
of
this
secret
information
which
daily
goes
across
the
North
Sea
.
<EOS>
Such
hidebound
patriots
as
the
Professor
are
a
peril
to
the
nation
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
he
refuses
to
help
himself
,
Jacox
,
we
must
protect
him
ourselves
,
"
Ray
declared
.
<EOS>
"
I
leave
it
to
you
and
Vera
to
keep
an
open
eye
until
I
return
from
Selkirk
next
Monday
.
<EOS>
I
'm
bound
to
go
down
and
see
my
sister
.
<EOS>
She
seems
very
ill
indeed
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
so
a
very
important
and
delicate
affair
was
thus
placed
in
my
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Vera
Vallance
announced
herself
ready
and
eager
to
assist
me
,
and
that
night
I
walked
back
to
Bloomsbury
much
puzzled
how
next
to
act
.
 
<EOS>
That
the
Germans
would
attempt
to
secure
the
secret
of
the
new
steel
was
absolutely
certain
.
<EOS>
But
to
us
,
success
meant
the
keeping
of
it
to
Britain
,
and
the
armouring
of
our
new
_
Dreadnoughts
_
with
a
resisting
power
eight
times
that
of
our
enemies
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
I
journeyed
down
to
Sheffield
and
called
upon
the
manager
of
Messrs.
Joynson
and
Mackinder
,
the
great
steel
-
makers
,
who
,
as
you
know
,
hold
the
contracts
for
making
the
armour
-
plates
of
our
improved
_
Dreadnoughts
_
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
how
the
firm
had
just
constructed
six
of
the
new
Emden
electrical
furnaces
,
and
had
also
taken
over
the
wonderful
new
process
which
the
Professor
had
invented
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
courteously
took
me
across
to
that
portion
of
the
great
grimy
works
,
with
its
wonderful
steel
melting
and
refining
furnaces
,
to
where
the
Emden
process
was
about
to
be
carried
out
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
have
no
fear
of
the
new
method
being
learnt
by
any
of
your
rivals
--
by
any
German
firm
,
for
instance
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
in
the
least
,
"
laughed
the
manager
,
a
bluff
,
grey
-
bearded
man
,
speaking
in
his
broad
Hallamshire
dialect
;
"
we
take
good
care
of
that
.
<EOS>
Each
workman
only
does
a
part
,
the
whole
of
the
process
being
only
known
to
myself
.
<EOS>
It
would
n't
do
for
us
to
give
Professor
Emden
forty
thousand
pounds
for
the
secret
and
then
allow
it
to
fall
into
foreign
hands
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
would
,
of
course
,
give
anything
for
it
,
"
he
added
.
<EOS>
"
Emden
is
a
patriotic
Englishman
even
though
he
is
very
eccentric
,
and
if
he
liked
he
could
have
got
almost
anything
he
cared
to
ask
from
Krupp
's
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
just
the
point
,
"
I
said
;
and
then
,
as
we
walked
back
to
the
office
,
I
explained
my
fears
.
<EOS>
But
,
like
the
Professor
himself
,
he
only
laughed
them
to
scorn
.
<EOS>
So
that
evening
I
again
returned
to
London
filled
with
anxiety
and
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
Just
before
eleven
that
same
night
I
strolled
past
the
house
of
Hermann
Hartmann
,
in
Pont
Street
,
vaguely
wondering
what
I
could
do
to
prevent
a
theft
which
must
,
I
knew
,
shortly
be
committed
.
<EOS>
In
all
probability
the
ingenious
Hartmann
already
had
a
secret
agent
in
Joynson
's
works
,
but
even
if
he
had
,
he
would
certainly
not
be
able
to
discover
the
secret
.
<EOS>
I
had
quite
satisfied
myself
upon
that
point
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
the
peril
lay
in
the
Professor
himself
--
the
strange
old
pig
-
headed
patriot
.
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
I
passed
Hartmann
's
house
,
the
exterior
of
which
I
knew
so
<EOS>
well
,
when
I
heard
the
front
door
close
and
saw
a
man
coming
down
the
steps
.
<EOS>
As
he
walked
in
my
direction
I
halted
beneath
a
lamp
to
light
a
cigarette
,
and
by
so
doing
<EOS>
I
obtained
a
glimpse
of
his
face
as
he
passed
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
young
,
good
-
looking
,
smartly
dressed
man
,
with
dark
eyes
and
hair
and
a
rather
sallow
complexion
.
<EOS>
I
put
him
down
to
be
an
Italian
,
but
I
had
never
set
eyes
upon
him
before
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
he
was
one
of
Hartmann
's
travelling
agents
--
a
man
who
went
up
and
down
England
visiting
the
fixed
spies
of
Germany
,
or
"
letter
-
boxes
,
"
as
they
are
known
in
the
bureau
of
secret
police
in
Berlin
--
collecting
their
reports
and
making
payments
for
information
or
services
rendered
.
 
<EOS>
Knowing
<EOS>
so
much
of
the
ways
of
the
German
secret
agent
,
curiosity
prompted
me
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
He
strolled
as
far
as
the
corner
of
Sloane
Street
and
Knightsbridge
,
and
then
boarded
a
motor
-
bus
as
far
as
Piccadilly
Circus
.
<EOS>
Thence
<EOS>
he
walked
to
the
German
beer
-
hall
,
the
Gambrinus
,
just
off
Coventry
Street
,
where
he
joined
a
tall
,
thin
,
grey
-
moustached
man
,
an
Italian
like
himself
,
who
was
seated
awaiting
him
.
<EOS>
I
idled
across
to
a
table
close
by
,
called
for
beer
,
and
sat
smoking
a
cigarette
and
straining
my
ears
to
catch
their
conversation
,
which
was
in
Italian
,
a
language
I
know
fairly
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
discovered
the
following
facts
.
<EOS>
The
thin
-
faced
man
was
called
Giovanni
,
while
the
elegant
young
fellow
was
Uberto
,
and
they
were
discussing
the
arrival
of
somebody
.
<EOS>
Giovanni
seemed
dubious
about
something
,
while
the
man
who
had
left
Hartmann
's
seemed
enthusiastic
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
quarter
of
an
hour
Uberto
glanced
at
his
watch
,
made
some
remark
to
his
companion
,
and
they
rose
and
went
out
together
,
driving
in
a
taxicab
westward
<EOS>
,
I
following
in
another
,
which
I
fortunately
found
just
in
time
.
<EOS>
Through
Kensington
we
went
,
over
Hammersmith
Bridge
,
through
Barnes
,
and
across
the
Common
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
realised
we
were
going
to
Richmond
.
 
<EOS>
The
chase
grew
exciting
.
<EOS>
Before
me
I
could
see
the
red
back
-
lamp
of
the
taxi
as
it
sped
forward
,
and
half
an
hour
later
we
were
crossing
Richmond
Bridge
,
where
,
a
short
distance
along
the
road
to
Twickenham
,
they
suddenly
swung
round
to
the
left
into
St.
Margaret
's
and
pulled
up
before
a
good
-
sized
detached
house
which
stood
back
in
its
own
grounds
,
in
which
were
several
big
trees
.
<EOS>
The
thoroughfare
was
,
I
noted
,
called
Brunswick
road
.
 
<EOS>
My
taxi
-
driver
proved
himself
no
fool
.
<EOS>
I
had
told
him
to
follow
;
therefore
,
unable
to
pull
up
sharply
,
he
swept
past
,
and
did
not
stop
until
we
were
round
the
bend
in
the
quiet
suburban
road
and
thus
out
of
sight
.
 
<EOS>
I
ordered
him
to
remain
,
and
,
alighting
,
strolled
back
past
the
house
in
question
.
<EOS>
About
its
dark
exterior
was
a
distinct
air
of
mystery
.
<EOS>
The
pair
had
entered
,
and
the
taxi
was
awaiting
them
.
<EOS>
The
house
was
an
old
-
fashioned
one
,
solid
and
substantial
in
character
,
and
apparently
the
residence
of
some
prosperous
City
man
;
yet
I
wondered
why
its
owner
should
have
visitors
at
that
hour
.
<EOS>
Surely
great
urgency
had
compelled
the
pair
to
come
all
the
way
from
Piccadilly
Circus
to
consult
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
a
surprise
was
in
store
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
After
lurking
about
in
the
shadows
with
that
expert
evasiveness
which
I
had
now
acquired
,
I
presently
saw
the
pair
make
their
exit
,
but
,
to
my
surprise
,
they
were
accompanied
out
to
the
kerb
by
a
woman
--
apparently
a
lady
in
black
evening
dress
,
the
bodice
of
which
was
cut
low
.
 
<EOS>
About
her
shoulders
she
had
wrapped
a
pale
blue
shawl
,
and
as
the
young
Uberto
entered
the
taxi
I
heard
her
exclaim
in
Italian
:
 
<EOS>
"
_
Addio
!
<EOS>
_
To
-
morrow
at
one
then
,
at
Prince
's
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
she
moved
I
saw
her
countenance
by
the
light
of
the
cab
lamp
,
a
handsome
,
well
-
cut
face
,
typical
of
a
woman
of
Piedmont
,
for
she
had
spoken
in
a
dialect
unmistakably
that
of
Turin
.
<EOS>
The
Turinese
are
more
French
than
Italian
,
and
are
as
different
in
both
temperament
and
language
from
those
of
the
south
as
the
people
of
the
Ardennes
differ
from
those
of
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
Both
men
shook
hands
with
her
warmly
,
bade
her
"
_
Addio
_
,
"
and
entering
the
taxi
,
drove
away
back
to
London
,
while
I
stood
still
watching
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
I
gazed
I
saw
as
she
walked
back
to
the
house
,
in
the
doorway
,
silhouetted
against
the
light
,
an
old
man
coming
forward
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
Dio
!
_
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
half
in
alarm
at
seeing
him
.
<EOS>
Then
in
Italian
,
she
added
,
"
Why
do
you
risk
being
seen
,
you
imbecile
?
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
you
keep
where
you
were
?
"
 
<EOS>
Then
the
door
closed
,
and
seeking
my
taxi
<EOS>
I
also
returned
to
Bloomsbury
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
incident
had
aroused
a
good
deal
of
doubt
and
suspicion
within
me
.
<EOS>
Who
was
that
handsome
young
Italian
woman
whom
the
spies
had
visited
at
that
late
hour
?
<EOS>
And
,
above
all
,
who
was
that
man
with
whom
she
had
been
annoyed
for
showing
himself
?
 
<EOS>
Next
day
proved
conclusively
that
some
crooked
business
was
in
progress
,
for
while
I
sat
alone
eating
my
lunch
in
a
corner
of
the
big
room
at
Prince
's
Restaurant
in
Piccadilly
<EOS>
,
I
was
amazed
to
see
the
well
-
dressed
young
Italian
--
the
man
whom
I
had
seen
emerge
from
Hartmann
's
in
Pont
Street
,
enter
with
no
other
person
than
Nella
Emden
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
the
spies
had
already
made
considerable
progress
!
<EOS>
My
indignation
was
such
that
I
could
have
walked
over
to
the
table
where
the
pair
had
seated
themselves
,
and
denounced
that
elegant
Italian
as
a
spy
of
the
Kaiser
.
<EOS>
But
I
foresaw
that
by
patience
I
might
yet
discover
more
that
would
be
of
interest
.
 
<EOS>
From
my
corner
I
watched
the
pair
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
The
girl
was
certainly
extremely
good
-
looking
,
young
,
and
by
her
manner
I
could
see
that
she
was
shy
at
being
with
a
male
companion
alone
in
a
public
restaurant
.
<EOS>
He
,
on
his
part
,
was
exercising
over
her
all
the
fascination
of
his
nation
.
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
I
saw
him
smile
covertly
across
behind
me
,
and
when
I
had
an
opportunity
to
glance
round
I
realised
,
to
my
surprise
,
that
the
man
whom
he
had
called
Giovanni
was
lunching
with
the
handsome
Italian
woman
from
St.
Margaret
's
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
that
they
were
watching
the
young
pair
.
<EOS>
For
what
reason
,
I
wondered
?
 
<EOS>
I
remained
on
the
alert
,
but
that
day
discovered
nothing
more
,
though
I
followed
the
young
pair
back
to
Richmond
and
saw
the
Italian
part
affectionately
from
Nella
Emden
near
her
father
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
For
some
days
I
prosecuted
an
unceasing
vigil
,
for
already
I
had
recognised
the
seriousness
of
a
secret
falling
into
the
enemies
'
hands
which
would
undoubtedly
give
them
the
advantage
in
the
coming
struggle
.
 
<EOS>
One
afternoon
Vera
Vallance
met
me
at
Waterloo
Station
,
and
together
we
went
down
to
Richmond
,
where
I
showed
her
the
Professor
's
house
,
and
together
we
waited
for
the
coming
of
Nella
.
<EOS>
Vera
,
enthusiastic
as
ever
,
and
ingenious
at
keeping
observation
,
followed
the
girl
,
while
in
fear
of
being
recognised
I
went
back
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
she
called
at
New
Stone
Buildings
,
smart
,
neat
,
and
altogether
sweet
and
winning
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr.
Jacox
,
"
she
said
,
seating
herself
by
my
fire
,
"
I
had
a
curious
experience
after
I
left
you
yesterday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Nella
went
first
by
tram
to
Twickenham
,
and
near
the
Town
Hall
there
met
the
young
Italian
,
who
had
a
companion
--
Hartmann
himself
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hartmann
!
<EOS>
"
I
gasped
.
"
<EOS>
Then
our
suspicions
are
surely
well
grounded
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
they
are
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
at
once
drew
back
,
fearing
that
our
clever
friend
of
Pont
Street
should
notice
me
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
he
did
not
,
therefore
I
was
able
to
watch
and
ascertain
where
they
went
--
to
the
house
in
St.
Margaret
's
where
you
saw
that
Italian
woman
.
<EOS>
They
apparently
stayed
there
to
tea
,
for
about
half
-
past
five
<EOS>
the
young
man
came
out
and
walked
in
the
direction
of
Richmond
Bridge
.
<EOS>
I
,
however
,
remained
behind
,
and
though
I
waited
for
hours
,
until
long
after
dark
,
neither
Hartmann
nor
the
girl
made
their
reappearance
.
<EOS>
But
at
nine
a
very
remarkable
incident
occurred
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Three
men
came
along
the
road
in
the
darkness
carrying
something
.
<EOS>
When
they
drew
near
me
and
turned
into
the
gate
of
the
house
,
I
stood
aghast
.
<EOS>
Upon
their
shoulders
was
a
coffin
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
coffin
!
<EOS>
"
I
echoed
,
staring
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
And
though
I
waited
until
midnight
,
Hartmann
did
not
come
forth
,
neither
did
the
Professor
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
make
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
looking
into
my
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
I
admitted
that
the
affair
was
a
mystery
,
and
suggested
that
we
might
ascertain
whether
Nella
had
returned
to
her
home
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Go
down
to
Richmond
and
see
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
I
did
without
delay
.
<EOS>
I
watched
the
house
during
that
afternoon
,
and
just
at
dusk
saw
the
dark
-
eyed
maid
-
servant
emerge
to
post
a
letter
.
<EOS>
I
followed
her
up
the
hill
to
the
pillar
-
box
,
and
by
the
application
of
a
couple
of
half
-
crowns
obtained
some
information
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
girl
,
"
Miss
Nella
's
not
come
home
.
<EOS>
The
master
's
in
a
great
state
about
her
.
<EOS>
She
went
out
for
a
walk
yesterday
afternoon
,
and
though
he
's
been
to
the
police
,
nobody
seems
to
have
seen
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
was
her
father
's
assistant
in
his
experiments
,
I
've
heard
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
she
was
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
poor
Mrs.
Emden
died
,
two
years
ago
,
she
's
been
her
father
's
right
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Had
she
a
lover
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well"--and
the
girl
hesitated
.
<EOS>
"
We
in
the
kitchen
have
our
suspicions
.
<EOS>
Davis
the
cook
saw
her
last
Sunday
walking
over
in
Teddington
with
a
dark
young
man
,
who
looked
like
a
foreigner
.
<EOS>
But
,
"
she
added
,
"
why
do
you
want
to
know
all
this
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
trying
to
trace
the
young
lady
,
"
I
said
,
in
the
hope
that
she
would
believe
me
to
be
a
detective
.
"
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
"
I
urged
;
"
does
the
Professor
make
any
experiments
at
home
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
sir
;
his
laboratory
is
up
on
the
top
floor
--
fitted
up
with
an
electric
furnace
and
lots
of
funny
appliances
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Has
he
any
friends
who
are
foreigners
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
that
I
know
of
,
"
was
the
girl
's
reply
.
<EOS>
And
I
thought
she
regarded
me
rather
strangely
.
<EOS>
Why
,
I
could
not
conceive
.
<EOS>
Her
name
was
Annie
Whybrow
,
she
told
me
,
and
then
,
unable
to
detain
her
longer
I
allowed
her
to
re
-
enter
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Vera
's
story
of
the
coffin
being
taken
into
that
mysterious
house
in
Brunswick
Road
,
combined
with
the
non
-
return
of
the
pretty
Nella
,
was
certainly
mystifying
.
 
<EOS>
I
returned
to
London
,
saw
Vera
,
and
we
resolved
to
wire
to
Ray
at
Selkirk
asking
him
to
return
to
London
as
soon
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
That
night
,
and
the
next
,
I
haunted
the
usual
resorts
of
foreigners
in
the
West
End
,
the
underground
Cafe
de
l'Europe
,
the
Spaten
beer
-
hall
in
Leicester
Square
,
the
Cafe
Monico
,
the
Gambrinus
,
and
other
places
,
in
order
to
discover
the
young
Italian
.
<EOS>
On
the
second
evening
I
was
successful
,
for
I
saw
him
in
the
Monico
,
and
on
inquiring
of
a
man
I
knew
,
I
learnt
that
his
name
was
Uberto
Mellini
,
that
until
recently
he
had
lived
in
Paris
,
and
that
at
the
present
moment
he
was
staying
in
a
house
in
Dean
Street
,
Soho
.
 
<EOS>
At
midnight
,
when
I
returned
to
Bloomsbury
,
I
found
Vera
and
Ray
anxiously
awaiting
me
.
<EOS>
The
latter
had
only
arrived
in
London
from
Scotland
an
hour
before
,
and
his
fiancee
had
evidently
told
him
of
the
curious
events
which
had
transpired
and
the
sinister
mystery
surrounding
the
young
girl
's
disappearance
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
see
no
reason
for
it
at
all
,
"
he
declared
,
when
we
commenced
to
discuss
the
situation
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
plain
that
our
friends
the
enemy
are
actively
at
work
,
but
surely
the
fact
that
Nella
is
missing
would
put
the
Professor
upon
his
guard
.
<EOS>
This
young
Italian
Mellini
is
evidently
a
new
importation
,
and
has
pretended
to
form
an
attachment
for
Nella
for
some
ulterior
object
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
what
do
you
make
of
the
incident
of
the
coffin
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
has
been
no
funeral
from
that
house
in
Brunswick
Road
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
as
far
as
I
can
gather
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
Registrar
of
Deaths
would
be
able
to
inform
us
,
"
he
said
reflectively
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
inquire
.
"
 
<EOS>
Next
day
all
three
of
us
returned
to
Richmond
,
and
while
Ray
and
Vera
crossed
the
bridge
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
Thames
to
find
the
Registrar
's
office
,
I
lingered
and
watched
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Professor
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
waited
for
many
weary
hours
in
the
wet
--
<EOS>
for
rain
fell
the
whole
day
--
but
Ray
did
not
return
,
which
caused
me
considerable
misgivings
.
<EOS>
I
was
compelled
to
resort
to
all
sorts
of
subterfuges
in
order
not
to
attract
attention
;
but
as
my
friend
had
directed
me
to
remain
and
watch
,
I
waited
patiently
at
my
post
.
 
<EOS>
Just
after
the
street
lamps
were
lit
,
a
telegraph
messenger
arrived
,
and
ten
minutes
after
he
had
gone
the
girl
Annie
came
out
with
hat
and
jacket
on
,
and
turning
to
the
left
hurried
in
my
direction
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
passed
I
spoke
to
her
,
and
,
recognising
me
,
she
explained
that
she
was
going
for
a
cab
to
convey
the
Professor
to
the
station
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Nella
is
at
Liverpool
,
"
she
added
excitedly
.
<EOS>
"
The
master
has
had
a
wire
from
her
,
asking
him
to
go
there
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
's
very
ill
,
it
seems
.
<EOS>
The
poor
master
is
greatly
excited
.
<EOS>
He
's
just
telephoned
to
the
police
saying
that
Miss
Nella
has
been
found
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
the
girl
hurried
away
,
down
the
hill
to
the
foot
of
the
bridge
,
where
there
was
a
cab
-
stand
.
 
<EOS>
Nella
at
Liverpool
!
<EOS>
What
could
possibly
have
occurred
?
 
<EOS>
Later
on
I
watched
the
Professor
,
carrying
only
a
handbag
,
enter
a
cab
and
drive
rapidly
to
the
station
,
while
Annie
returned
to
the
house
and
closed
the
front
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
then
about
six
o'clock
,
and
I
had
been
watching
there
for
nearly
eight
hours
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
decided
to
go
in
search
of
Ray
,
who
was
over
at
St.
Margaret
's
,
and
who
,
I
thought
,
would
most
probably
be
watching
the
house
to
which
the
coffin
had
been
taken
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
I
was
not
mistaken
,
for
I
found
him
idling
at
the
end
of
that
quiet
,
dark
suburban
road
.
<EOS>
He
was
on
the
alert
the
instant
he
recognised
me
,
and
in
a
few
rapid
sentences
I
told
him
what
had
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
It
puzzled
him
greatly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
ascertained
that
Hartmann
is
back
at
Pont
Street
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
why
the
coffin
should
be
in
yonder
house
is
still
a
mystery
.
<EOS>
The
Registrar
has
had
no
intimation
of
any
death
in
Brunswick
Road
for
the
past
eight
months
.
<EOS>
I
've
,
however
,
found
the
local
undertaker
,
who
says
that
a
plain
coffin
was
ordered
for
a
gentleman
and
that
they
duly
delivered
it
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
see
the
body
,
being
told
that
the
funeral
was
to
be
undertaken
by
a
big
West
End
firm
,
and
that
the
body
was
to
be
conveyed
for
burial
somewhere
near
Leicester
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
found
out
anything
further
regarding
the
occupants
of
the
house
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
only
that
it
was
taken
furnished
by
a
gentleman
a
month
ago
--
a
foreigner
whose
description
exactly
tallies
with
that
of
Hartmann
--
for
an
old
man
and
his
daughter
--
both
Italians
.
<EOS>
They
've
kept
themselves
very
much
to
themselves
,
therefore
the
neighbours
know
practically
nothing
about
their
business
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Nella
Emden
was
enticed
in
there
.
<EOS>
I
'm
certain
of
that
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Yet
the
fact
that
she
's
in
Liverpool
rather
negatives
my
first
theory
of
foul
play
,
"
I
added
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
still
remain
watchful
.
<EOS>
Vera
has
gone
to
make
some
inquiries
for
me
over
at
Mortlake
.
<EOS>
I
expect
her
back
in
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
You
return
and
keep
a
watchful
eye
upon
the
Professor
's
place
.
<EOS>
One
never
knows
what
crooked
business
may
be
on
hand
!
"
 
<EOS>
So
back
I
went
,
and
through
the
whole
evening
waited
there
,
chilled
to
the
bone
,
in
vain
expectancy
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
noticed
from
Ray
's
manner
that
he
had
become
very
suspicious
.
<EOS>
He
somehow
scented
the
presence
of
spies
at
times
when
,
I
confess
,
I
felt
calm
and
reassured
.
<EOS>
And
his
natural
intuition
was
seldom
,
if
ever
,
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
The
church
bells
across
the
river
had
chimed
midnight
,
the
Professor
's
servants
had
put
out
the
lights
and
retired
,
and
the
thoroughfare
was
now
deserted
.
<EOS>
Hungry
and
tired
out
,
I
was
contemplating
relaxing
my
vigil
when
Ray
suddenly
turned
a
corner
and
joined
me
,
saying
breathlessly
:
 
"
Uberto
and
his
friend
are
coming
up
the
hill
with
another
man
.
<EOS>
Vera
and
I
have
seen
them
call
at
Brunswick
Road
,
and
they
are
now
on
their
way
here
.
<EOS>
We
must
keep
a
strict
watch
.
<EOS>
Something
is
up
!
"
 
<EOS>
We
separated
,
and
concealing
ourselves
in
the
basements
of
the
houses
opposite
,
we
witnessed
that
which
caused
our
heart
-
beats
to
quicken
.
 
<EOS>
The
three
men
came
along
in
silence
in
the
night
,
for
they
evidently
wore
rubber
heels
on
their
boots
.
<EOS>
The
constable
was
then
some
distance
down
the
hill
,
therefore
they
passed
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
approached
the
house
,
the
man
whom
I
had
heard
addressed
as
Giovanni
hurried
forward
,
and
slipping
suddenly
into
the
narrow
front
garden
,
approached
the
kitchen
window
.
<EOS>
Inserting
something
between
the
sashes
,
he
pushed
back
the
latch
,
carefully
drew
back
the
blind
,
and
was
within
the
house
almost
before
the
two
others
had
entered
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
without
a
sound
,
the
pair
followed
him
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
three
spies
had
entered
the
premises
so
quickly
that
we
could
scarcely
believe
our
own
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
police
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Ray
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
get
the
constable
.
<EOS>
Slip
down
the
hill
and
tell
him
.
<EOS>
We
'll
make
a
fine
capture
this
time
!
"
 
<EOS>
Down
the
hill
I
sped
,
and
five
minutes
later
was
back
with
the
constable
,
having
briefly
explained
to
him
our
suspicions
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
German
spies
,
sir
,
but
whoever
's
inside
is
liable
for
burglariously
entering
,
and
we
'll
have
'
em
,
"
whispered
the
officer
.
 
<EOS>
Silently
we
entered
just
as
the
spies
had
done
,
passing
through
the
kitchen
,
and
up
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
The
laboratory
was
at
the
top
of
the
house
I
knew
,
and
was
always
kept
locked
.
<EOS>
Therefore
we
crept
forward
,
without
the
slightest
sound
.
 
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
,
we
listened
.
<EOS>
The
spies
were
absolutely
silent
--
well
trained
to
that
sort
of
nocturnal
investigation
,
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
As
Ray
and
I
got
to
the
door
of
the
big
room
,
which
,
by
the
light
of
the
flash
-
lamp
used
by
the
intruders
,
we
could
see
was
fitted
with
all
sorts
of
appliances
,
we
witnessed
through
the
crack
that
they
had
secured
a
number
of
specimens
of
metals
and
were
all
three
at
that
moment
engaged
in
drilling
a
hole
in
the
big
dark
green
safe
standing
in
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
whispered
the
constable
,
"
let
's
rush
them
.
"
<EOS>
And
with
a
loud
shout
we
dashed
in
upon
them
,
revolvers
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
we
were
in
total
darkness
.
<EOS>
Deep
curses
in
Italian
sounded
,
and
I
heard
a
desperate
struggle
taking
place
.
<EOS>
Somebody
grabbed
at
me
,
but
it
was
our
friend
the
constable
.
<EOS>
Then
,
by
the
red
flash
of
a
revolver
which
somebody
fired
,
I
distinguished
the
flying
form
of
one
of
the
intruders
through
the
doorway
.
 
<EOS>
Next
second
,
in
the
darkness
,
I
felt
a
man
brush
past
me
,
and
instantly
I
closed
with
him
.
<EOS>
We
fell
together
,
and
as
I
gripped
the
fellow
's
throat
he
ejaculated
a
loud
imprecation
in
Italian
.
<EOS>
Then
we
rolled
over
in
desperate
embrace
,
but
as
I
forced
him
beneath
me
,
shouting
to
the
constable
,
whose
lantern
had
been
knocked
from
his
hand
and
broken
,
I
suddenly
felt
a
crushing
blow
upon
the
skull
.
<EOS>
I
saw
a
thousand
stars
,
and
then
the
blackness
of
unconsciousness
fell
upon
me
.
        
<EOS>
*
      
<EOS>
*
      
<EOS>
*
      
<EOS>
*
      
<EOS>
*
 
<EOS>
When
I
again
grew
cognisant
of
what
was
going
on
about
me
,
I
found
myself
lying
in
bed
in
the
Richmond
Cottage
Hospital
with
a
pleasant
-
faced
nurse
bending
eagerly
over
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
still
night
,
for
the
gas
was
burning
.
 
<EOS>
She
asked
how
I
felt
,
remarking
that
I
had
received
a
nasty
crack
,
and
had
lain
there
unconscious
for
three
whole
days
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
I
felt
the
presence
of
some
one
else
near
me
,
and
gradually
made
them
out
to
be
Ray
and
Vera
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
they
would
tell
me
nothing
,
but
after
the
doctor
had
seen
me
,
Ray
in
his
cheery
way
said
:
 
"
Yours
was
a
bit
of
hard
luck
,
old
fellow
.
<EOS>
The
blackguards
all
got
away
--
all
three
of
them
.
<EOS>
But
we
were
just
in
time
,
for
in
that
safe
<EOS>
were
the
memoranda
of
the
Professor
's
experiments
which
,
together
with
the
specimens
of
the
new
metal
that
could
have
been
analysed
,
would
have
undoubtedly
placed
the
secret
of
the
new
steel
in
the
hands
of
the
German
Admiralty
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
we
really
prevented
them
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
eagerly
,
feeling
the
bandages
about
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Just
in
the
very
nick
of
time
,
old
man
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
And
we
did
more
.
<EOS>
We
managed
to
save
Miss
Nella
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
<EOS>
I
inquired
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
's
here
.
<EOS>
She
'll
tell
you
herself
.
"
<EOS>
And
next
moment
I
saw
her
standing
before
me
with
the
Professor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr.
Jacox
,
"
the
girl
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
to
thank
you
.
<EOS>
I
was
first
approached
by
the
young
Italian
while
crossing
Richmond
Bridge
one
day
,
and
later
on
he
introduced
me
to
his
sister
,
who
lived
in
St.
Margaret
's
.
<EOS>
On
the
afternoon
when
I
was
induced
to
go
there
<EOS>
I
was
given
something
in
my
tea
which
at
once
rendered
me
unconscious
.
<EOS>
When
I
recovered
,
I
found
myself
lying
in
a
coffin
secured
to
rings
inside
,
while
a
villainous
old
man
,
a
bearded
German
,
and
an
Italian
woman
were
about
to
screw
down
the
lid
.
<EOS>
I
screamed
,
but
they
took
no
notice
,
until
in
fear
I
fainted
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
shall
I
ever
forget
those
horrible
moments
?
<EOS>
I
was
alone
,
helpless
in
the
hands
of
those
fiends
,
all
because
I
had
allowed
myself
to
become
attracted
by
a
stranger
!
<EOS>
They
held
me
there
for
days
,
trying
to
learn
from
me
the
secret
of
my
father
's
discovery
.
<EOS>
But
I
would
tell
them
nothing
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
how
I
suffered
,
believing
every
hour
that
they
would
close
down
that
lid
.
<EOS>
Then
the
brutes
,
finding
me
defiant
,
and
believing
that
no
one
was
aware
of
their
existence
,
hit
upon
another
device
--
sending
a
false
telegram
to
my
father
from
Liverpool
,
and
thus
taking
him
away
from
the
house
in
order
to
be
afforded
a
clear
field
for
their
investigations
.
<EOS>
Of
this
I
,
of
course
,
knew
nothing
until
your
friends
entered
the
house
forcibly
with
the
police
and
found
me
still
imprisoned
--
ah
!
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
ready
for
death
and
burial
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
the
strange
old
Professor
,
stepping
forward
,
seized
my
hand
warmly
in
his
,
saying
:
 
"
To
you
and
your
two
good
friends
,
Mr.
Jacox
,
the
country
owes
a
great
and
deep
debt
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
I
was
foolish
in
disregarding
your
timely
warning
,
for
my
dear
daughter
very
nearly
lost
her
life
,
because
the
blackguards
knew
she
had
assisted
me
in
my
experiments
and
had
made
the
notes
at
my
dictation
,
while
Britain
very
nearly
lost
the
secret
upon
which
,
in
the
near
future
,
will
depend
her
supremacy
at
sea
.

CHAPTER
VII
 
<EOS>
THE
SECRET
OF
THE
IMPROVED
"
DREADNOUGHT
"
  
<EOS>
The
road
was
crooked
and
narrow
,
and
the
car
was
a
nondescript
"
ninety
,
"
full
of
knocks
and
noise
.
 
<EOS>
By
appointment
I
had
,
for
certain
reasons
that
will
afterwards
be
apparent
,
met
,
in
the
American
Bar
of
the
"
Savoy
,
"
two
hours
before
,
the
Honourable
Robert
Brackenbury
,
the
dark
,
clean
-
shaven
young
man
now
driving
,
<EOS>
and
he
had
engaged
me
,
at
a
salary
of
two
pounds
ten
per
week
,
to
be
his
chauffeur
.
<EOS>
I
had
driven
him
out
through
the
London
traffic
,
until
,
satisfied
with
my
skill
,
he
had
taken
the
wheel
himself
,
and
we
were
now
out
upon
the
Great
North
Road
,
where
he
had
a
pressing
engagement
to
meet
a
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Beyond
Hatfield
we
passed
through
Ayot
Green
,
and
were
on
our
way
to
Welwyn
,
when
suddenly
he
swung
the
powerful
car
into
a
narrow
stony
by
-
road
,
where
,
after
several
sharp
turns
,
he
pulled
up
before
a
pleasant
,
old
-
fashioned
,
red
-
roofed
cottage
standing
back
in
a
large
garden
and
covered
with
ivy
and
climbing
roses
.
 
<EOS>
A
big
,
stout
,
clean
-
shaven
,
merry
-
faced
man
,
with
slightly
curly
fair
hair
,
standing
in
the
rustic
porch
,
waved
his
hand
in
welcome
as
we
both
descended
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
invited
into
the
clean
cottage
parlour
,
and
there
introduced
to
the
stout
man
,
who
,
I
found
,
was
named
Charles
Shand
,
and
by
whose
speech
I
instantly
recognised
an
American
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
"
<EOS>
So
this
is
the
new
chauffeur
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
looking
me
up
and
down
with
his
large
blue
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
Say
,
young
man
,
"
he
added
,
"
you
've
got
a
good
berth
if
you
can
drive
well
--
and
what
's
more
important
,
keep
a
still
tongue
.
"
 
I
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
What
did
he
mean
?
 
<EOS>
Both
saw
that
I
was
puzzled
,
whereupon
he
hastened
to
allay
my
surprise
by
explaining
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
friend
and
I
run
a
car
each
.
<EOS>
He
has
a
six
-
cylinder
'
sixty
'
here
,
and
we
want
you
to
look
after
both
.
<EOS>
No
cleaning
.
<EOS>
You
are
engineer
,
and
will
drive
occasionally
.
<EOS>
Come
and
see
the
other
car
.
"
<EOS>
And
taking
me
to
the
rear
of
the
premises
,
they
showed
me
,
standing
in
a
newly
built
shed
,
one
of
the
latest
pattern
six
-
cylinder
"
Napiers
"
fitted
with
every
modern
improvement
.
<EOS>
It
was
painted
cream
,
and
upon
the
panels
an
imposing
crest
.
<EOS>
A
big
searchlight
was
set
over
the
splash
-
board
.
<EOS>
It
was
fitted
with
the
latest
lubrication
,
and
seemed
almost
new
.
<EOS>
To
me
,
motor
enthusiast
as
I
am
,
it
was
a
delight
to
have
such
a
splendid
car
under
my
control
,
and
my
heart
leapt
within
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
friend
,
Mr.
Brackenbury
,
will
be
liberal
in
the
matter
of
wages
,
"
remarked
Shand
,
"
provided
that
you
simply
do
as
you
are
bid
and
ask
no
questions
.
<EOS>
Blind
obedience
is
all
that
we
require
.
<EOS>
Our
private
business
does
not
concern
you
in
the
least
--
you
understand
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
if
you
make
a
promise
of
faithful
and
silent
service
,
we
shall
pay
you
three
pounds
ten
a
week
instead
of
the
two
ten
which
we
arranged
this
morning
,
"
said
Brackenbury
.
 
<EOS>
I
thanked
them
both
,
and
returning
to
the
house
Shand
produced
some
whisky
and
a
syphon
,
gave
me
a
drink
and
a
cigar
,
and
told
me
that
if
I
wished
to
stroll
about
for
an
hour
I
was
at
liberty
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
The
afternoon
was
a
warm
one
in
July
,
therefore
I
passed
out
into
a
field
,
and
beneath
the
shade
of
a
tree
threw
myself
down
to
smoke
and
reflect
.
<EOS>
For
nearly
four
months
,
though
Ray
and
I
had
been
ever
watchful
,
we
had
discovered
but
little
.
<EOS>
We
had
had
our
suspicions
aroused
,
however
,
and
I
had
resolved
to
follow
them
up
.
<EOS>
Both
men
seemed
good
fellows
enough
,
yet
the
glances
they
had
exchanged
were
meaning
,
and
thereby
increased
my
suspicions
.
 
<EOS>
When
,
an
hour
later
,
I
re
-
entered
the
house
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
room
,
I
found
the
pair
with
a
map
spread
out
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
They
had
evidently
been
in
earnest
consultation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fortunately
for
you
you
are
not
married
,
Nye
,
"
exclaimed
the
Honourable
Robert
,
whom
I
strongly
suspected
to
be
of
German
birth
,
though
he
spoke
English
perfectly
and
had
appeared
to
have
many
friends
among
the
habitues
of
the
"
Savoy
.
<EOS>
"
Nye
was
the
name
I
had
given
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
have
two
places
of
residence
--
here
with
Shand
,
and
with
me
at
my
little
place
over
at
Barnes
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
main
roads
pretty
well
,
you
told
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
a
lot
of
touring
when
I
was
with
Mr.
Michelreid
,
the
novelist
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
used
to
be
always
in
search
of
fresh
places
to
write
about
.
<EOS>
We
always
went
to
the
Continent
a
lot
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
he
laughed
,
"
you
'll
soon
have
an
opportunity
of
putting
your
knowledge
of
the
road
to
the
test
.
<EOS>
To
be
of
any
real
service
to
us
,
you
'll
have
to
be
able
to
find
your
way
,
say
,
from
here
to
Harwich
in
the
night
without
taking
one
wrong
turning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
touring
England
for
nearly
five
years
,
off
and
on
,
"
I
said
,
with
confidence
;
"
therefore
few
people
know
the
roads
,
perhaps
,
better
than
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
we
shall
see
,
"
remarked
Shand
;
"
only
not
a
word
--
not
even
to
your
sweetheart
.
<EOS>
My
friend
and
I
are
engaged
in
some
purely
private
affairs
--
in
fact
,
I
think
there
is
no
harm
in
telling
you
--
now
that
you
are
to
be
our
confidential
servant
--
that
we
are
secret
agents
of
the
Government
,
and
as
such
are
compelled
on
occasions
to
act
in
a
manner
that
any
one
unacquainted
with
the
truth
might
consider
somewhat
peculiar
.
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
not
a
word
must
pass
your
lips
--
not
to
a
soul
,
"
he
urged
.
<EOS>
"
For
each
success
we
gain
in
the
various
missions
entrusted
to
us
you
will
receive
from
the
Secret
Service
fund
a
handsome
honorarium
as
acknowledgment
of
your
faithful
services
.
"
 
<EOS>
Then
he
walked
away
,
gaily
singing
the
gay
chanson
of
Magda
at
the
Ambassadeurs
:
     
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Much
gratified
at
securing
such
a
post
,
I
drove
the
Honourable
Robert
back
to
London
and
waited
for
him
in
the
courtyard
of
the
Hotel
Cecil
while
he
was
inside
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Then
,
getting
up
beside
me
he
directed
me
to
drive
to
Hammersmith
Bridge
,
where
,
at
a
big
block
of
red
-
brick
flats
overlooking
the
river
,
called
Lonsdale
Mansions
,
we
pulled
up
,
and
he
took
me
up
to
his
small
cosily
furnished
flat
,
where
William
,
the
clean
-
shaven
and
highly
-
respectable
valet
,
awaited
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
"
ninety
"
was
garaged
,
I
found
,
almost
opposite
,
and
when
I
returned
to
the
flat
the
Honourable
Robert
was
at
the
telephone
in
the
dining
-
room
talking
to
the
man
we
had
left
near
Welwyn
.
 
<EOS>
The
elderly
woman
who
acted
as
cook
showed
me
my
room
,
gave
me
my
dinner
,
and
I
sat
smoking
with
William
for
an
hour
or
so
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
The
valet
was
a
very
inquisitive
person
,
and
I
could
not
fail
to
notice
how
cleverly
he
tried
to
pump
me
concerning
my
post
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
failed
to
obtain
much
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
guv'nor
is
one
of
the
best
fellows
alive
--
a
thorough
sportsman
,
"
he
informed
me
.
"
<EOS>
Respect
his
confidence
,
and
do
n't
breathe
a
word
to
any
one
as
to
his
doings
,
and
you
'll
find
your
place
worth
hundreds
a
year
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
why
these
strict
injunctions
regarding
silence
?
"
I
inquired
,
in
the
hope
of
learning
something
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
--
because
he
's
compelled
to
mix
himself
up
with
queer
affairs
and
queer
people
sometimes
,
and
in
his
position
as
the
younger
son
of
a
peer
it
would
n't
do
if
it
leaked
out
.
<EOS>
I
simply
act
as
he
bids
,
and
seek
no
explanation
.
<EOS>
You
'll
have
to
do
the
same
.
"
 
<EOS>
Hardly
had
he
ceased
speaking
when
"
the
guv'nor
,
"
in
dinner
-
jacket
and
black
tie
,
entered
,
and
said
:
 
"
William
,
I
want
you
to
take
a
letter
for
me
to
Raven
at
Nottingham
by
the
next
train
.
<EOS>
It
leaves
St.
Pancras
at
10.45
.
<EOS>
You
'll
be
there
at
2.30
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
He
's
at
the
'
Black
Boy
.
'
<EOS>
Get
an
answer
and
take
the
5.50
back
.
<EOS>
You
'll
be
here
again
soon
after
nine
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
sir
,
"
answered
the
valet
,
taking
the
letter
from
his
master
's
hand
;
and
ten
minutes
later
he
went
downstairs
to
catch
his
train
.
 
<EOS>
This
incident
showed
that
Robert
Brackenbury
was
essentially
a
man
of
action
.
<EOS>
His
keen
,
dark
aquiline
face
,
bright
,
sharp
eyes
,
and
quick
,
almost
electric
movements
combined
to
show
him
to
be
a
man
of
nerve
,
resource
,
and
rapid
decision
.
<EOS>
The
square
lower
jaw
betokened
hard
determination
,
while
at
the
same
time
his
manner
was
easy
,
nonchalant
,
and
essentially
that
of
a
born
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
William
returned
next
morning
,
and
a
few
days
passed
uneventfully
.
<EOS>
Both
morning
and
evening
each
day
,
at
hours
prearranged
,
he
"
got
on
"
to
Shand
,
but
their
conversations
were
very
enigmatical
.
<EOS>
Several
times
I
happened
to
be
in
the
room
,
but
could
learn
nothing
from
the
talk
,
which
seemed
,
in
the
main
,
to
refer
to
the
rise
and
fall
of
certain
mining
shares
.
 
<EOS>
Each
day
I
drove
him
out
in
the
"
ninety
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
car
,
a
four
-
cylinder
,
had
no
flexibility
,
and
was
a
perfect
terror
in
traffic
.
<EOS>
The
noise
it
caused
was
as
though
it
had
no
silencer
,
while
the
police
everywhere
looked
askance
as
we
crept
through
the
Strand
,
dodged
the
motor
-
buses
in
Oxford
Street
,
or
put
on
a
move
down
Kensington
Gore
.
 
<EOS>
While
Bob
Brackenbury
--
as
he
was
known
to
his
friends
of
the
"
Savoy"--was
out
one
day
,
I
was
in
his
bedroom
with
William
,
when
the
latter
opened
one
of
the
huge
wardrobes
there
.
<EOS>
Inside
I
saw
hanging
a
collection
of
at
least
fifty
coats
of
all
kinds
,
some
smart
and
of
latest
style
,
others
old
-
fashioned
and
dingy
,
while
more
than
one
was
greasy
,
out
-
at
-
elbow
,
and
ragged
.
<EOS>
I
made
no
remark
.
<EOS>
Never
in
my
life
had
I
seen
such
an
extensive
collection
of
clothes
belonging
to
one
man
.
<EOS>
Surely
those
ragged
coats
were
kept
there
for
purposes
of
disguise
!
<EOS>
Yet
would
it
not
be
highly
necessary
for
a
member
of
the
Secret
Service
to
possess
certain
disguises
,
I
reflected
!
 
<EOS>
William
noticed
my
interest
,
and
shut
the
doors
hurriedly
.
 
<EOS>
I
drove
Brackenbury
hither
and
thither
to
various
parts
of
London
,
for
he
seemed
to
possess
many
friends
.
<EOS>
Once
we
took
two
pretty
young
ladies
from
Hampstead
down
to
the
"
Mitre
"
at
Hampton
Court
,
and
on
another
afternoon
we
took
a
young
French
girl
and
her
mother
from
the
"
Carlton
"
down
to
the
"
Old
Bridge
House
"
at
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
To
me
it
was
apparent
that
Bob
Brackenbury
was
very
popular
with
a
certain
set
at
the
Motor
Club
,
at
the
Automobile
Club
,
and
at
other
resorts
.
 
<EOS>
My
duties
were
not
at
all
arduous
,
and
such
a
thoroughgoing
sportsman
was
my
master
that
he
treated
me
almost
as
an
equal
.
<EOS>
When
out
in
the
country
he
compelled
me
to
have
lunch
at
his
table
"
for
company
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
My
people
,
I
told
him
,
had
been
wealthy
before
the
South
African
War
,
but
had
been
ruined
by
it
,
and
though
I
had
been
at
Rugby
and
had
done
one
year
at
Balliol
College
,
Oxford
,
I
hid
the
fact
now
that
I
was
compelled
to
earn
my
living
as
a
mere
chauffeur
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
idea
that
I
was
a
barrister
,
with
chambers
in
New
Stone
Buildings
.
 
<EOS>
One
morning
after
breakfast
Mr.
Brackenbury
called
me
into
the
little
dining
-
room
,
wherein
stood
his
capacious
roll
-
top
desk
against
the
wall
,
with
the
telephone
upon
it
,
and
inviting
me
to
a
seat
opposite
the
fireplace
,
said
in
a
voice
which
betrayed
just
the
faintest
accent
:
 
"
Nye
,
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
confidentially
to
you
for
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
You
recollect
that
the
day
before
yesterday
when
down
at
Windsor
I
was
speaking
with
a
police
-
inspector
in
uniform
,
who
called
at
the
hotel
to
see
me
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
He
looked
round
the
car
and
spoke
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
thought
he
'd
come
to
take
our
name
for
exceeding
the
limit
on
the
Staines
road
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
'd
remember
him
again
if
you
saw
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
was
my
prompt
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
do
n't
forget
him
,
"
he
urged
,
"
because
you
may
,
before
long
,
be
required
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
should
chance
to
mistake
the
man
,
a
very
serious
_
contretemps
_
would
ensue
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
recognise
him
again
among
a
thousand
!
<EOS>
"
I
declared
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
.
<EOS>
Now
listen
attentively
to
me
for
a
few
minutes
,
"
he
said
,
lighting
a
fresh
cigarette
and
fixing
his
dark
,
penetrating
eyes
upon
mine
.
<EOS>
"
I
and
my
friend
Shand
have
a
very
difficult
task
.
<EOS>
A
certain
Colonel
von
Rausch
,
of
the
German
Intelligence
Department
,
is
,
we
have
discovered
,
in
England
on
a
secret
mission
.
<EOS>
It
is
suspected
that
he
is
here
controlling
a
number
of
spies
who
had
been
engaged
in
staff
-
rides
in
the
eastern
counties
,
and
to
receive
their
reports
.
<EOS>
My
object
is
to
learn
the
truth
,
and
it
can
only
be
done
by
great
tact
and
caution
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
this
so
that
any
orders
I
give
you
may
not
surprise
you
.
<EOS>
Obey
,
and
do
not
seek
motive
.
<EOS>
Am
I
clear
?

<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
I
answered
,
interested
in
what
he
told
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
curious
that
he
,
undoubtedly
a
German
,
was
at
the
same
time
antagonistic
to
the
colonel
of
the
Kaiser
's
army
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'm
leaving
London
in
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Await
orders
from
me
,
and
obey
them
promptly
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
dismissing
me
.
 
<EOS>
Through
that
day
and
the
next
I
waited
.
<EOS>
He
had
taken
William
with
him
into
the
country
,
and
left
me
alone
in
the
flat
.
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
the
telephone
rang
,
but
to
the
various
inquirers
I
replied
that
my
master
was
absent
.
 
<EOS>
Inactivity
there
was
tantalising
.
<EOS>
I
was
naturally
fond
of
adventure
,
and
I
had
taken
on
the
guise
of
chauffeur
surely
for
the
unmasking
of
a
foreign
spy
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
third
day
,
about
two
in
the
afternoon
,
I
received
a
trunk
call
on
the
'
phone
.
<EOS>
The
post
office
at
Market
Harborough
called
me
up
,
and
the
voice
which
I
heard
was
that
of
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
that
's
you
,
Nye
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
want
you
to
start
in
the
car
in
an
hour
,
and
run
her
up
to
Peterborough
.
<EOS>
When
in
the
Market
Place
,
inquire
the
road
to
Edgcott
Hall
.
<EOS>
It
's
about
six
miles
out
on
the
Leicester
road
.
<EOS>
Inquire
for
me
there
as
Captain
Kinghorne
--
remember
the
name
now
.
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
distinctly
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
"
Recollect
what
I
told
you
before
I
left
.
<EOS>
I
shall
expect
you
about
six
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
"
he
said
,
and
then
rang
off
.
 
<EOS>
Full
of
excitement
,
I
got
out
the
car
from
the
garage
,
filled
the
petrol
tank
,
saw
to
the
carbide
,
and
then
set
out
across
the
suspension
bridge
at
Hammersmith
,
and
went
through
Kensal
Green
and
Hampstead
over
to
Highgate
,
where
I
got
upon
the
North
Road
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
raining
,
and
there
was
plenty
of
mud
about
,
but
the
big
,
powerful
car
ran
well
notwithstanding
the
terrific
noise
it
created
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
was
such
a
terror
and
possessed
so
many
defects
that
little
wonder
its
maker
had
not
placed
his
name
upon
her
.
<EOS>
As
a
hill
-
climber
,
however
,
she
was
excellent
,
and
though
being
compelled
constantly
to
change
my
"
speeds
,
"
I
did
an
average
of
thirty
miles
an
hour
after
getting
into
the
open
country
beyond
Codicote
.
 
<EOS>
Through
crooked
old
Hitchin
I
slowed
up
,
then
away
again
through
Henlow
and
Eton
Socon
up
Alconbury
Hill
and
down
the
broad
road
with
its
many
telegraph
lines
<EOS>
,
I
went
with
my
exhaust
open
,
roaring
and
throbbing
,
through
Stilton
village
into
the
quiet
old
cathedral
town
of
Peterborough
.
<EOS>
Inquiry
in
the
Market
Place
led
me
across
a
level
crossing
near
the
station
and
down
a
long
hill
,
then
out
again
into
a
flat
agricultural
district
until
I
came
to
the
handsome
lodge
-
gates
of
Edgcott
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
Up
a
fine
elm
avenue
<EOS>
I
went
for
nearly
a
mile
,
until
I
saw
before
me
in
the
crimson
<EOS>
sunset
a
long
,
old
Elizabethan
mansion
with
high
twisted
chimneys
and
many
latticed
windows
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
open
,
and
as
I
pulled
up
<EOS>
I
saw
within
a
great
high
wall
with
stained
windows
like
a
church
and
stands
of
armour
ranged
down
either
side
.
 
<EOS>
A
footman
in
yellow
waistcoat
answered
my
ring
,
and
my
inquiry
for
Captain
Kinghorne
brought
forth
my
master
,
smartly
dressed
in
a
brown
flannel
suit
and
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hulloa
,
Nye
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
"
<EOS>
Got
here
all
right
,
then
.
<EOS>
Newton
will
show
the
way
to
the
garage
,
"
and
he
indicated
the
footman
.
<EOS>
"
When
you
've
put
her
up
,
I
want
to
see
you
in
my
room
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
footman
,
mounted
beside
me
,
directed
me
across
the
park
to
the
kennels
of
the
celebrated
Edgcott
hounds
,
and
behind
these
I
found
a
well
-
appointed
garage
,
in
which
were
two
other
cars
,
a
"
sixteen
"
Fiat
of
a
type
three
years
ago
,
and
a
"
forty
"
Charron
with
a
limousine
body
,
a
very
heavy
,
ponderous
affair
.
 
<EOS>
A
quarter
of
an
hour
later
I
found
myself
with
the
Honourable
Bob
in
a
big
,
old
-
fashioned
bedroom
overlooking
the
park
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
understood
me
on
the
'
phone
,
Nye
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
when
I
had
closed
the
door
<EOS>
and
we
were
alone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shand
is
guest
here
with
me
under
the
name
of
Pawson
,
while
,
as
you
know
,
I
'm
Captain
Kinghorne
,
<EOS>
D.S.O.
This
is
necessary
,
"
he
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
The
name
of
Bob
Brackenbury
would
,
in
an
instant
,
frighten
away
our
friend
the
German
.
<EOS>
The
people
here
,
the
Edgcotts
,
do
n't
know
our
real
names
,
"
he
added
.
<EOS>
"
All
you
have
to
do
is
to
remain
here
and
act
as
I
direct
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
moment
later
the
stout
American
entered
and
greeting
me
,
turned
to
his
friend
,
saying
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
Nye
knows
that
Charles
Shand
is
off
the
map
at
present
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
just
been
explaining
,
"
my
master
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
'd
better
spread
a
picturesque
story
among
the
servants
,
too
,
Nye
,
"
the
American
went
on--"the
bravery
of
Captain
Kinghorne
at
Ladysmith
,
and
the
wide
circle
of
financial
friends
possessed
by
Archibald
Pawson
,
of
Goldfields
,
Nevada
.
<EOS>
The
Edgcotts
must
be
filled
up
with
us
,
and
that
infernal
Dutchman
must
n't
suspect
that
we
have
anything
to
do
with
Whitehall
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
that
moment
William
,
the
valet
,
came
in
.
 
<EOS>
"
Von
Rausch
met
a
strange
man
this
afternoon
in
a
little
thatched
inn
called
the
'
Fitzwilliam
Arms
,
'
over
at
Castor
.
<EOS>
They
were
nearly
half
an
hour
together
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
grooms
pulled
up
there
for
a
drink
and
saw
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Suppose
he
met
one
of
his
secret
agents
,
"
remarked
my
master
,
with
a
glance
at
his
friend
.
<EOS>
"
We
've
got
to
have
our
eyes
open
,
and
there
must
n't
be
any
moss
on
us
in
this
affair
.
<EOS>
To
expose
this
man
and
his
spying
crowd
will
be
to
teach
Germany
a
lesson
which
she
's
long
wanted
.
<EOS>
We
shall
receive
the
private
thanks
of
the
Cabinet
for
our
services
,
which
would
be
to
us
,
patriotic
Englishmen
as
we
all
are
,
something
to
be
proud
of
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Guess
two
heads
are
better
than
one
,
as
the
hatter
said
when
twins
entered
his
shop
,
"
laughed
the
broad
-
faced
American
.
 
<EOS>
We
both
agreed
,
and
a
few
moments
later
I
left
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
Edgcotts
seemed
to
be
entertaining
quite
a
large
house
-
party
,
<EOS>
all
of
them
smart
people
,
for
that
evening
after
dinner
I
caught
sight
of
pretty
women
in
handsome
dresses
and
flashing
jewels
.
<EOS>
Being
a
warm
night
,
bridge
was
played
in
the
fine
old
hall
,
where
the
vaulted
roof
echoed
back
the
well
-
bred
laughter
and
gay
chatter
of
the
party
,
which
included
Mr.
Henry
Seymour
,
Civil
Lord
of
the
Admiralty
,
and
several
well
-
known
politicians
.
 
<EOS>
Essentially
a
sporting
crowd
,
many
of
them
were
men
and
women
who
hunted
in
winter
with
the
Cottesmore
,
the
Woodland
Pytchley
and
the
Edgcott
packs
.
<EOS>
William
and
I
peeped
in
through
the
crack
of
one
of
the
doors
,
and
he
pointed
out
to
me
a
tall
,
fair
-
haired
,
middle
-
aged
man
whose
soft
-
pleated
shirt
-
front
and
the
cut
of
whose
dress
-
coat
betrayed
him
to
be
a
foreigner
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
he
was
leaning
over
the
chair
of
a
pretty
little
dark
-
haired
woman
in
pale
blue
,
who
struck
me
as
a
foreigner
also
,
and
who
wore
twisted
twice
around
her
neck
a
magnificent
rope
of
large
pearls
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
von
Rausch
,
"
William
explained
.
<EOS>
"
And
look
at
the
guv'nor
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
.
<EOS>
"
He
seems
to
be
having
a
good
time
with
the
thin
woman
over
there
.
<EOS>
He
's
talking
in
French
to
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
My
eyes
wandered
in
search
of
Pawson
,
and
I
saw
that
he
was
seated
at
one
of
the
bridge
-
tables
silently
contemplating
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
The
German
spy
was
evidently
a
great
favourite
with
the
ladies
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
his
popularity
with
the
fair
sex
had
gained
for
him
entry
to
that
little
circle
of
the
elegant
world
.
<EOS>
Two
young
girls
approached
him
,
laughing
gaily
and
slowly
fanning
themselves
.
<EOS>
He
then
chatted
with
all
three
in
English
which
had
only
a
slight
trace
of
Teutonic
accent
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
man
was
,
<EOS>
I
reflected
,
the
head
of
a
horde
of
secret
agents
which
the
German
War
Office
had
flung
upon
our
eastern
coast
.
<EOS>
To
expose
and
crush
them
all
was
surely
the
patriotic
duty
of
any
Englishman
.
 
<EOS>
The
magnificent
old
mansion
with
its
splendid
paintings
,
its
antique
furniture
,
its
armour
,
its
bric
-
a
-
brac
,
old
silver
,
and
splendid
heirlooms
of
the
Edgcotts
rang
with
the
laughter
of
the
assembly
as
two
young
subalterns
indulged
in
humorous
horse
-
play
.
 
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
the
old
sphinx
-
like
family
butler
,
however
,
compelled
us
to
leave
our
point
of
observation
,
and
for
an
hour
I
strolled
with
William
out
in
the
park
in
the
balmy
moonlight
of
the
summer
night
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
'll
be
a
sensation
before
long
,
"
declared
the
valet
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
You
watch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
what
way
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
with
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wait
and
see
<EOS>
,
"
he
laughed
,
as
though
he
possessed
knowledge
of
what
was
intended
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
I
drove
my
master
and
the
German
Colonel
over
to
Nottingham
,
where
we
put
up
for
an
hour
at
the
Black
Boy
Hotel
.
<EOS>
This
struck
me
as
curious
,
for
I
recollected
that
William
had
been
sent
down
from
London
with
a
message
to
some
person
named
Raven
staying
at
that
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
way
from
Edgcott
,
through
Oakham
,
Melton
Mowbray
,
and
Trent
,
I
had
endeavoured
to
catch
some
of
the
conversation
between
the
pair
in
the
car
behind
me
.
<EOS>
The
noise
and
rattle
,
however
,
prevented
me
from
overhearing
much
,
but
the
stray
sentences
which
did
reach
me
when
I
slowed
down
to
change
my
speeds
showed
them
to
be
on
the
most
friendly
terms
.
 
<EOS>
Evidently
the
spy
was
entirely
unsuspicious
of
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
hotel
,
after
I
had
put
up
the
car
,
I
saw
my
master
and
the
German
speaking
with
a
tall
,
thin
,
consumptive
-
looking
man
in
black
,
whose
white
tie
showed
him
to
be
a
dissenting
minister
.
<EOS>
He
was
clean
-
shaven
,
aged
fifty
,
and
had
an
unusually
protruding
chin
.
 
<EOS>
All
three
went
out
together
and
walked
along
the
street
chatting
.
<EOS>
When
they
had
gone
I
went
back
into
the
yard
,
and
on
inquiry
found
that
the
minister
was
the
Reverend
Richard
Raven
,
of
the
Baptist
Missionary
Society
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
missionary
in
China
,
and
had
addressed
several
meetings
in
Nottingham
and
the
neighbourhood
on
behalf
of
the
society
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
wondered
,
had
Bob
Brackenbury
,
so
essentially
a
man
about
town
,
come
there
to
consult
a
Baptist
missionary
,
and
accompanied
,
too
,
by
the
man
he
was
scheming
to
unmask
?
 
<EOS>
But
the
ways
of
the
Secret
Service
were
devious
and
crooked
,
I
argued
.
<EOS>
There
was
method
in
it
all
.
<EOS>
Had
Ray
and
I
been
mistaken
after
all
?
<EOS>
So
I
,
too
,
lit
a
cigarette
,
and
strolled
out
into
the
bustling
provincial
street
awaiting
my
master
and
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
After
an
hour
and
a
half
the
trio
came
back
and
had
a
drink
together
in
the
smoking
-
room
--
the
missionary
taking
lemonade
--
and
then
I
brought
round
the
car
,
and
we
began
the
return
journey
of
about
sixty
-
five
miles
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
it
now
?
"
<EOS>
asked
my
master
of
his
companion
as
soon
as
we
were
away
from
the
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Excellent
!
"
was
the
German
's
reply
.
<EOS>
"
It
only
now
lies
with
her
,
eh
?
"
And
he
laughed
lightly
.
 
<EOS>
Dinner
was
over
when
we
returned
,
and
Captain
Kinghorne
was
profuse
in
his
apologies
to
his
host
.
<EOS>
I
had
previously
been
warned
to
say
nothing
of
where
we
had
been
,
and
I
heard
my
master
explain
that
we
had
passed
through
Huntingdon
,
where
a
tyre
-
burst
had
delayed
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
became
puzzled
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
it
was
certainly
both
interesting
and
exciting
.
<EOS>
Little
did
the
gallant
German
Colonel
dream
of
the
sword
of
England
's
wrath
suspended
above
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
Nearly
a
week
passed
.
<EOS>
Captain
Kinghorne
,
D.S.O.
,
and
Mr.
Pawson
,
of
Goldfields
,
Nevada
,
shared
,
I
saw
,
with
the
Colonel
the
highest
popularity
among
members
of
the
house
-
party
.
<EOS>
With
Mr.
Henry
Seymour
they
had
become
on
particularly
friendly
terms
.
<EOS>
There
were
picnics
,
tennis
,
and
a
couple
of
dances
to
which
all
the
local
notabilities
were
bidden
.
<EOS>
At
them
all
Kinghorne
was
the
life
and
soul
of
the
general
merriment
.
<EOS>
A
good
many
quiet
flirtations
were
in
progress
too
.
<EOS>
Kinghorne
seemed
to
be
particularly
attracted
by
the
pretty
little
widow
whom
I
had
first
seen
in
pale
blue
,
and
who
I
discovered
was
French
,
her
name
being
the
Baronne
de
Bourbriac
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
divide
her
attentions
between
Mr.
Seymour
and
the
German
Colonel
.
 
<EOS>
From
mademoiselle
,
her
maid
,
I
learned
that
Madame
la
Baronne
had
lost
her
husband
after
only
four
months
of
matrimony
,
and
now
found
herself
in
possession
of
a
great
fortune
,
a
house
in
the
Avenue
des
Champs
Elysees
,
a
villa
at
Roquebrune
,
and
the
great
mediaeval
chateau
of
Bourbriac
,
in
the
great
wine
-
lands
along
the
Saone
.
 
<EOS>
Was
she
<EOS>
,
I
wondered
,
contemplating
matrimony
again
?
<EOS>
One
evening
before
the
dressing
-
bell
sounded
,
I
met
them
quite
accidentally
strolling
together
across
the
park
,
and
the
earnestness
of
their
conversation
caused
my
wonder
to
increase
.
 
<EOS>
Careful
observation
,
however
,
showed
me
that
Colonel
von
Rausch
was
almost
as
much
a
favourite
with
the
little
widow
as
was
the
Honourable
Bob
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
in
the
three
days
which
followed
I
recognised
plainly
that
the
skittish
little
widow
,
so
charming
,
so
chic
,
and
dressed
with
that
perfection
only
possible
with
the
true
Parisienne
,
was
playing
a
double
game
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
inclined
to
tell
my
master
,
yet
on
due
reflection
saw
that
his
love
affairs
were
no
concern
of
mine
,
while
to
speak
would
be
only
to
betray
myself
as
spying
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
held
silence
,
but
nevertheless
continued
to
watch
.
 
<EOS>
Several
times
I
took
out
Brackenbury
,
Shand
,
von
Rausch
,
and
others
in
the
car
.
<EOS>
Twice
the
widow
went
for
a
run
alone
with
my
master
and
myself
.
<EOS>
Life
was
,
to
say
the
least
,
extremely
pleasant
in
those
warm
summer
days
at
Edgcott
.
 
<EOS>
Late
one
afternoon
the
Honourable
Bob
found
me
in
the
garage
,
and
in
a
low
voice
said
:
 
"
You
must
pretend
to
be
unwell
,
Nye
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
take
von
Rausch
out
by
myself
,
so
go
back
to
the
house
and
pretend
you
're
queer
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
I
did
without
question
,
and
he
and
the
Colonel
were
out
together
in
an
unknown
direction
until
nearly
midnight
.
<EOS>
Had
they
<EOS>
,
I
wondered
,
gone
again
to
meet
the
consumptive
converter
of
the
Chinese
to
Christianity
?
 
<EOS>
I
took
William
into
my
confidence
,
but
he
was
silent
.
<EOS>
He
would
express
no
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
moss
on
the
guv'nor
,
you
bet
,
"
was
all
he
would
vouchsafe
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
for
yet
another
four
days
things
progressed
merrily
at
Edgcott
Hall
.
<EOS>
William
had
been
sent
away
on
a
message
up
to
Manchester
,
and
I
was
taking
his
place
,
when
one
evening
,
while
I
was
getting
out
"
the
guv'nor
's
"
dress
clothes
,
he
entered
the
room
,
and
closing
the
door
carefully
,
said
:
 
"
Be
ready
for
something
to
happen
to
-
night
,
Nye
.
<EOS>
We
're
going
to
hold
up
the
spy
and
make
him
disgorge
all
the
secret
reports
supplied
by
his
agents
.
<EOS>
Listen
to
my
instructions
,
for
all
must
be
done
without
any
fuss
.
<EOS>
We
do
n't
want
to
upset
the
good
people
here
.
<EOS>
You
see
that
small
dressing
-
case
of
mine
over
there?"--and
he
indicated
a
square
crocodile
-
skin
case
with
silver
fittings
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
at
ten
o'clock
go
and
get
the
car
out
on
the
excuse
that
you
have
to
go
into
Peterborough
for
me
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
Shand
's
bag
already
in
it
,
so
put
your
own
in
also
,
but
do
n't
let
anybody
see
you
.
<EOS>
Run
her
down
the
road
about
a
mile
from
the
lodge
-
gates
and
into
that
by
-
road
just
beyond
the
finger
-
posts
where
I
showed
you
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
Then
pull
up
,
put
out
the
lights
,
and
leave
her
as
though
you
've
had
a
breakdown
.
<EOS>
Walk
back
here
,
get
my
dressing
-
case
,
and
carry
it
back
to
the
car
.
<EOS>
Then
wait
for
us
.
<EOS>
Only
recollect
,
do
n't
return
to
get
my
bag
until
half
-
past
ten
.
<EOS>
You
see
those
two
candles
on
the
dressing
-
table
?
<EOS>
Now
if
any
hitch
occurs
,
I
shall
light
them
.
<EOS>
So
if
I
do
,
leave
my
bag
here
and
bring
my
car
back
.
<EOS>
You
understand
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
,
"
I
said
,
full
of
excitement
.
<EOS>
And
then
I
helped
him
to
dress
hurriedly
,
and
he
went
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
about
to
"
hold
up
"
the
spy
.
<EOS>
But
how
?
 
<EOS>
Those
hours
dragged
slowly
by
.
<EOS>
I
peeped
into
the
hall
after
dinner
and
saw
the
Honourable
Bob
seated
in
a
corner
with
the
Baronne
,
away
from
the
others
,
chatting
with
her
.
<EOS>
The
spy
,
all
unsuspicious
,
was
talking
to
his
hostess
,
while
Shand
was
playing
poker
.
 
<EOS>
Just
before
ten
I
crept
out
with
my
small
bag
,
unseen
by
any
one
,
and
walked
across
the
park
to
the
garage
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
stormy
,
the
moon
was
hidden
behind
a
cloud
-
bank
.
<EOS>
There
was
nobody
about
,
so
I
got
out
the
"
ninety
,
"
started
her
,
and
mounting
at
the
wheel
was
soon
gliding
down
the
avenue
,
out
of
the
lodge
-
gates
,
and
into
the
by
-
road
which
the
Honourable
Bob
had
indicated
.
<EOS>
Descending
,
I
looked
inside
the
car
and
saw
that
Shand
's
bag
had
already
been
placed
there
by
an
unknown
hand
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
short
run
I
noticed
I
had
lost
the
screw
cap
of
the
radiator
.
<EOS>
This
surprised
me
,
for
I
recollected
how
that
evening
when
filling
up
with
water
I
had
screwed
it
down
tightly
.
<EOS>
Somebody
must
have
tampered
with
it
--
some
stable
lad
,
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
Having
extinguished
the
head
-
lights
,
I
walked
back
to
the
Hall
by
the
stile
and
footpath
,
avoiding
the
lodge
-
gates
,
and
managed
to
slip
up
to
my
master
's
room
,
just
as
the
stable
-
clock
was
chiming
the
half
hour
.
 
<EOS>
The
candles
were
unlit
.
<EOS>
All
was
therefore
in
order
.
<EOS>
The
dressing
-
bag
was
,
however
,
not
there
.
<EOS>
I
searched
for
it
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Then
stealing
out
again
I
sped
by
the
footpath
back
to
the
car
.
 
<EOS>
Somebody
hailed
me
in
the
darkness
as
I
approached
the
spot
where
I
had
left
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
recognized
the
spy
's
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
see
Herr
Brackenbury
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
in
his
broken
English
.
 
<EOS>
I
halted
,
amazed
.
<EOS>
The
spy
had
,
it
seemed
,
outwitted
us
and
upset
all
our
plans
!
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
could
I
reply
,
however
,
before
I
heard
a
movement
behind
me
,
and
two
figures
loomed
up
.
<EOS>
They
were
my
master
and
Shand
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
right
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
American
in
a
low
voice
,
to
which
the
spy
gave
an
affirmative
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Light
those
lamps
,
Nye
,
"
ordered
my
master
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
get
away
this
instant
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But----
"
I
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quick
,
my
dear
fellow
!
<EOS>
There
's
not
a
moment
to
lose
.
<EOS>
Jump
in
,
boys
,
"
he
urged
.
 
<EOS>
And
a
couple
of
minutes
later
,
with
our
lamps
glaring
,
we
had
turned
out
upon
the
broad
highway
and
were
travelling
at
a
full
forty
miles
an
hour
upon
the
high
road
to
Leicester
.
 
<EOS>
What
could
it
all
mean
?
<EOS>
My
master
and
his
companion
seemed
on
the
most
friendly
terms
with
the
spy
.
 
<EOS>
Ten
miles
from
the
lodge
-
gates
of
Edgcott
at
a
cross
-
road
we
picked
up
an
ill
-
dressed
man
whom
I
recognised
as
the
Baptist
missionary
,
Richard
Raven
,
and
with
the
Honourable
Bob
at
my
side
directing
me
we
tore
on
through
the
night
,
traversing
numberless
by
-
roads
,
until
at
dawn
I
suddenly
recognised
that
we
were
on
the
North
Road
,
close
to
Codicote
.
 
<EOS>
A
quarter
of
an
hour
later
we
had
run
the
car
round
to
the
rear
of
Shand
's
pretty
rose
-
embowered
cottage
,
and
all
descended
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
excuse
to
the
Honourable
Bob
that
the
screw
top
of
the
radiator
was
missing
,
whereupon
von
Rausch
laughed
heartily
,
and
picking
up
a
piece
of
wire
from
the
bench
<EOS>
he
bent
it
so
as
to
form
a
hook
,
and
with
it
fished
down
in
the
hot
water
inside
.
 
<EOS>
His
companions
stood
watching
,
but
judge
my
surprise
when
I
saw
him
of
a
sudden
draw
forth
a
small
aluminium
cylinder
,
the
top
of
which
he
screwed
off
and
from
it
took
out
a
piece
of
tracing
-
linen
tightly
folded
.
 
<EOS>
This
he
spread
out
,
and
my
quick
eyes
saw
that
it
was
a
carefully
drawn
tracing
of
a
portion
of
the
new
type
of
battleship
of
the
_
Neptune
_
class
(
the
improved
_
Dreadnought
_
type
)
,
with
many
marginal
notes
in
German
in
a
feminine
hand
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
the
astounding
truth
became
plain
to
me
.
<EOS>
The
Baronne
,
who
was
in
von
Rausch
's
employ
,
had
no
doubt
surreptitiously
obtained
the
original
from
Mr.
Henry
Seymour
's
despatch
-
box
,
it
having
been
sent
down
to
him
to
Edgcott
for
his
approval
.
 
<EOS>
A
most
important
British
naval
secret
was
,
I
saw
,
in
the
hands
of
the
clever
spies
of
the
Kaiser
!
 
<EOS>
I
made
no
remark
,
for
in
presence
of
those
men
<EOS>
was
I
not
helpless
?
 
<EOS>
They
took
the
tracing
in
the
house
,
and
for
half
an
hour
held
carousal
in
celebration
of
their
success
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
Brackenbury
came
forth
to
me
and
said
:
 
"
The
Colonel
is
going
to
Harwich
this
evening
,
and
you
must
drive
him
.
<EOS>
The
boat
for
the
'
Hook
'
leaves
at
half
-
past
ten
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
sir
,
"
I
replied
,
with
apparent
indifference
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
quite
ready
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
seven
we
started
,
von
Rausch
and
I
,
and
until
darkness
fell
<EOS>
I
drove
eastward
,
<EOS>
when
at
last
we
found
ourselves
in
Ipswich
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
close
to
the
White
Horse
Hotel
and
within
hailing
distance
of
a
police
-
constable
,
I
brought
the
car
to
a
dead
stop
,
and
turning
to
the
German
,
who
was
seated
beside
me
,
said
in
as
quiet
a
tone
as
I
could
:
 
<EOS>
"
Colonel
von
Rausch
,
I
'll
just
trouble
you
to
hand
over
to
me
the
tracing
you
and
your
friends
have
stolen
from
Mr.
Henry
Seymour
--
the
details
of
the
new
battleship
about
to
be
built
at
Chatham
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
cried
the
spy
.
<EOS>
"
Drive
on
,
you
fool
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
time
to
lose
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
for
that
tracing
,
"
I
said
,
whipping
out
the
revolver
I
always
carried
.
"
<EOS>
Give
it
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
next
!
"
<EOS>
he
laughed
,
in
open
defiance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
are
you
,
a
mere
servant
,
that
you
should
dictate
to
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
an
Englishman
!
"
<EOS>
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
'll
not
allow
you
to
take
that
secret
to
your
employers
in
Berlin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
Colonel
glanced
round
in
some
confusion
.
<EOS>
He
was
evidently
averse
to
a
scene
in
that
open
street
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
into
the
hotel
yonder
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
We
can
discuss
the
matter
there
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
admits
of
no
discussion
,
"
I
said
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
hand
me
the
tracing
over
which
you
have
so
ingeniously
deceived
me
,
or
I
shall
call
the
constable
yonder
and
have
you
detained
while
we
communicate
with
the
Admiralty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Drive
on
,
I
tell
you
,
"
he
cried
in
anger
.
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
an
ass
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
a
fool
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Give
me
that
tracing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
turned
and
whistled
to
the
constable
,
who
had
already
noticed
us
in
heated
discussion
.
 
<EOS>
The
officer
approached
,
but
von
Rausch
,
finding
himself
in
a
corner
,
quickly
produced
an
envelope
containing
the
tracing
and
handed
it
to
me
,
urging
:
 
<EOS>
"
Remain
silent
,
Nye
.
<EOS>
Say
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
have
promised
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
broke
open
the
envelope
,
and
after
satisfying
myself
he
had
not
deceived
me
,
I
placed
it
safely
in
my
breast
-
pocket
,
as
further
evidence
of
the
work
of
the
Kaiser
's
spies
amongst
us
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
with
excuses
to
the
constable
,
I
swung
the
car
into
the
yard
of
the
White
Horse
Hotel
,
where
the
spy
descended
,
and
with
a
fierce
imprecation
in
German
he
hurried
out
,
and
I
saw
him
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
At
midnight
I
was
in
Ray
's
chambers
,
in
Bruton
Street
,
and
we
rang
up
Mr.
Henry
Seymour
,
who
had
<EOS>
,
we
found
,
returned
to
his
house
in
Curzon
Street
from
Edgcott
only
a
couple
of
hours
before
.
 
<EOS>
In
ignorance
that
spies
had
obtained
the
secret
of
the
_
Neptune
_
or
improved
_
Dreadnought
_
,
he
would
not
at
first
believe
the
story
we
told
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
in
his
own
library
half
an
hour
later
we
handed
him
back
the
tracing
,
he
was
compelled
to
admit
the
existence
of
German
espionage
in
England
,
though
in
the
House
of
Commons
only
a
week
before
he
had
scorned
the
very
idea
.

CHAPTER
VIII
 
<EOS>
THE
GERMAN
PLOT
AGAINST
ENGLAND
  
<EOS>
"
When
last
I
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
mademoiselle
,
both
her
nationality
and
her
name
were
--
well
--
slightly
different
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
I
remarked
,
bending
forward
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
From
her
pretty
lips
rang
out
a
merry
ripple
of
laughter
,
and
over
her
sweet
face
spread
a
mischievous
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
admit
the
allegation
,
M'sieur
Jacox
,
"
was
her
rather
saucy
response
in
French
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
had
no
idea
you
would
again
recognise
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
mademoiselle
,
beauty
such
as
yours
is
not
universal
,
and
is
always
to
be
remembered
,
"
I
said
,
with
an
expression
of
mock
reproval
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
why
do
you
flatter
me
--
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
"
especially
after
what
passed
at
Caux
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Surely
I
may
be
permitted
to
admire
you
,
Suzette
?
<EOS>
Especially
as
I
am
now
aware
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
started
,
and
stared
at
me
for
a
moment
,
a
neat
little
figure
in
black
.
<EOS>
Then
she
gave
her
shoulders
a
slight
shrug
,
pouting
like
a
spoiled
child
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
none
to
overhear
us
.
<EOS>
It
was
out
of
the
season
in
Paris
,
and
on
that
afternoon
,
the
15th
of
August
,
1908
,
to
be
exact
,
we
had
driven
by
"
auto
"
into
the
Bois
,
and
were
taking
our
"
five
o'clock
"
under
the
trees
at
Pre
Catalan
,
that
well
-
known
restaurant
in
the
centre
of
the
beautiful
pleasure
wood
of
the
Parisians
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
serious
business
with
Suzette
Darbour
.
 
<EOS>
After
our
success
in
preventing
the
plans
of
the
improved
_
Dreadnoughts
_
falling
into
German
hands
,
I
had
,
at
Ray
's
suggestion
,
left
Charing
Cross
in
search
of
the
dainty
little
divinity
before
me
,
the
neat
-
waisted
girl
with
the
big
dark
eyes
,
the
tiny
mouth
,
and
the
cheeks
that
still
bore
the
bloom
of
youth
upon
them
--
the
girl
who
,
at
the
Hotel
d'Angleterre
,
in
Copenhagen
,
had
been
known
as
Vera
Yermoloff
,
of
Riga
,
and
who
had
afterwards
lived
in
the
gay
little
watering
-
place
of
Caux
under
the
same
name
,
and
had
so
entirely
deceived
me
--
the
girl
whom
I
now
knew
to
be
the
catspaw
of
others
--
in
a
word
,
a
decoy
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
how
sweet
,
how
modest
her
manner
,
how
demure
she
looked
as
she
sat
there
before
me
at
the
little
table
beneath
the
trees
,
sipping
her
tea
and
lifting
her
smiling
eyes
to
mine
.
<EOS>
Even
though
I
had
told
her
plainly
that
I
was
aware
of
the
truth
,
she
remained
quite
unconcerned
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
fear
of
me
apparently
.
<EOS>
For
her
,
exposure
and
the
police
had
no
terrors
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
rather
amused
than
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
I
lit
a
cigarette
,
and
by
so
doing
obtained
time
for
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
My
search
had
led
me
first
to
the
Midi
,
thence
into
Italy
,
across
to
Sebenico
in
Dalmatia
,
to
Venice
,
and
back
to
Paris
,
where
only
that
morning
,
with
the
assistance
of
my
old
friend
of
my
student
days
in
the
French
capital
,
Gaston
Bernard
,
of
the
Prefecture
of
Police
,
I
had
succeeded
in
running
her
to
earth
.
<EOS>
I
had
only
that
morning
found
her
residing
with
a
girl
friend
--
a
seamstress
at
Duclerc's
--
in
a
tiny
flat
_
<EOS>
au
cinquieme
_
in
a
frowsy
old
house
at
the
top
of
the
Rue
Pigalle
,
and
living
in
her
own
name
,
that
of
Suzette
Darbour
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
I
sat
smoking
<EOS>
I
wondered
if
I
dared
request
her
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
my
efforts
to
combat
the
work
of
German
spies
in
England
I
had
been
forced
to
make
many
queer
friendships
,
but
none
perhaps
so
strange
as
the
one
I
was
now
cultivating
.
<EOS>
Suzette
Darbour
was
,
I
had
learned
from
Ray
Raymond
a
few
months
ago
,
a
decoy
in
association
with
a
very
prince
of
swindlers
,
an
American
who
made
his
head
-
quarters
in
Paris
,
and
who
had
in
the
past
year
or
two
effected
amazing
_
coups
_
,
financial
and
otherwise
,
in
the
various
capitals
of
Europe
.
 
<EOS>
Her
age
was
perhaps
twenty
-
two
,
though
certainly
she
did
not
look
more
than
eighteen
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
both
English
and
Russian
quite
well
,
for
,
as
she
had
told
me
long
ago
,
she
had
spent
her
early
days
in
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
And
probably
in
those
twenty
years
of
her
life
she
had
learnt
more
than
many
women
had
learned
in
forty
.
 
<EOS>
Hers
was
an
angelic
face
,
with
big
,
wide
-
open
,
truthful
eyes
,
but
her
heart
was
,
I
knew
,
cold
and
callous
.
 
<EOS>
Could
I
--
dare
I
--
take
her
into
my
service
--
to
assist
me
in
a
matter
of
the
most
vital
importance
to
British
interests
?
<EOS>
The
mission
upon
which
I
was
engaged
at
that
moment
was
both
delicate
and
difficult
.
<EOS>
A
single
false
move
would
mean
exposure
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
playing
a
deep
game
,
and
it
surely
behoved
me
to
exercise
every
precaution
.
<EOS>
During
the
years
I
had
been
endeavouring
to
prove
the
peril
to
which
England
was
exposed
from
foreign
invasion
,
I
had
never
been
nearer
failure
than
now
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
held
my
breath
each
time
I
recollected
all
that
depended
upon
my
success
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
Raymond
,
Vera
Vallance
,
and
myself
had
constituted
ourselves
into
a
little
band
with
the
object
of
combating
the
activity
of
the
ingenious
spies
of
the
Kaiser
.
<EOS>
Little
does
the
average
Englishman
dream
of
the
work
of
the
secret
agent
,
or
how
his
success
or
failure
is
reflected
in
our
diplomatic
negotiations
with
the
Powers
.
<EOS>
Ambassadors
and
ministers
may
wear
smart
uniforms
with
glittering
decorations
,
and
move
in
their
splendid
embassies
surrounded
by
their
brilliant
staffs
;
attaches
may
flirt
,
and
first
secretaries
may
take
tea
with
duchesses
,
yet
to
the
spy
is
left
the
real
work
of
diplomacy
,
for
,
<EOS>
after
all
,
it
is
upon
the
knowledge
he
obtains
that
His
Excellency
the
Ambassador
frames
his
despatch
to
his
Government
,
or
the
Minister
for
Foreign
Affairs
presents
a
"
Note
"
to
the
Powers
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
for
months
been
working
on
without
publicity
,
unheeded
,
unrecognised
,
unprotected
,
unknown
.
<EOS>
A
thankless
though
dangerous
task
,
our
only
reward
had
been
a
kind
word
from
the
silent
,
sad
-
faced
Prime
Minister
himself
.
<EOS>
For
months
our
whereabouts
had
been
unknown
,
even
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Ray
generally
scented
the
presence
of
spies
,
and
it
was
for
me
to
carry
through
the
inquiry
in
the
manner
which
I
considered
best
and
safest
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
"
Suzette
,
"
I
said
at
length
,
looking
at
her
across
the
rising
smoke
from
my
cigarette
,
"
<EOS>
when
we
last
met
you
had
the
advantage
of
me
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
we
stand
upon
even
ground
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pardon
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
quite
understand
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
little
lady
in
the
sheath
costume
with
just
a
slight
tremor
of
the
eyelids
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
--
I
have
discovered
that
you
and
Henry
Banfield
are
friends
--
that
to
you
he
owes
much
of
his
success
,
and
that
to
you
is
the
credit
of
a
little
affair
in
Marienbad
,
which
ended
rather
unpleasantly
for
a
certain
hosiery
manufacturer
from
Chemnitz
named
Mueller
.
"
 
<EOS>
Her
faced
blanched
,
her
eyes
grew
terrified
,
and
her
nails
clenched
themselves
into
her
white
palms
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Then
you
--
you
have
found
me
,
m'sieur
,
for
purposes
of
revenge
--
<EOS>
you
--
you
intend
to
give
me
over
to
the
police
because
of
the
fraud
I
practised
upon
you
!
<EOS>
But
I
ask
you
to
have
pity
for
me
,
"
she
begged
in
French
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
woman
--
and
--
and
I
swear
to
you
that
I
was
forced
to
act
towards
you
as
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
forced
open
my
despatch
-
box
,
believing
that
I
carried
valuables
there
,
and
found
,
to
your
dismay
,
only
a
few
papers
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
compelled
to
do
so
by
Banfield
,
"
she
said
simply
.
"
<EOS>
He
mistook
you
for
another
man
,
a
diplomat
,
and
believed
that
you
had
certain
important
documents
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
he
made
a
very
great
mistake
,
"
I
laughed
.
"
<EOS>
And
after
your
clever
love
-
making
with
me
you
only
got
some
extracts
from
a
Government
report
,
together
with
a
few
old
letters
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
From
those
letters
we
discovered
who
you
really
were
,
"
mademoiselle
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
then
we
were
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
smiled
.
 
<EOS>
"
Afraid
that
I
would
pay
Banfield
back
in
his
own
coin
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
afraid
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
,
for
he
told
me
that
if
you
attempted
any
reprisal
,
he
would
at
once
denounce
you
to
the
Germans
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thanks
.
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
you
've
told
me
that
,
"
I
said
,
with
feigned
unconcern
.
<EOS>
Truth
to
tell
,
however
,
I
was
much
upset
by
the
knowledge
that
the
cunning
American
who
so
cleverly
evaded
the
police
had
discovered
my
present
vocation
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
after
all
,
had
not
the
explanation
of
the
pretty
girl
before
me
rather
strengthened
my
hand
?
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Suzette
,
"
I
said
,
with
a
moment
's
reflection
,
"
I
have
not
sought
you
in
order
to
threaten
you
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
I
am
extremely
anxious
that
we
should
be
friends
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
want
you
,
if
you
will
,
to
do
me
a
service
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
,
apparently
much
puzzled
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
were
my
enemy
,
"
she
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
am
not
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
only
allow
me
,
I
will
be
your
friend
.
"
 
<EOS>
Her
fine
eyes
were
downcast
,
and
I
fancied
I
detected
in
them
the
light
of
unshed
tears
.
<EOS>
How
strange
it
was
that
upon
her
attitude
towards
me
should
depend
a
nation
's
welfare
!
 
<EOS>
"
First
,
you
must
forgive
me
for
my
action
at
Caux
,
"
she
said
in
a
low
,
earnest
voice
,
scarce
above
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
my
position
,
alas
!
<EOS>
I
dare
not
disobey
that
man
who
holds
my
future
so
irrevocably
in
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
threatens
you
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
If
I
disobeyed
any
single
one
of
his
commands
,
he
would
deliver
me
over
at
once
to
the
police
for
a
serious
affair
--
a
crime
,
however
,
of
which
I
swear
to
you
that
I
am
innocent
--
the
crime
of
murder
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
holds
threats
over
you
,
"
I
said
,
tossing
away
my
cigarette
.
<EOS>
"
Describe
the
affair
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
crime
of
the
Rue
de
Royat
,
two
years
ago
.
<EOS>
You
no
doubt
recollect
it
,
"
she
faltered
,
after
some
hesitation
.
"
<EOS>
A
Russian
lady
,
named
Levitsky
,
was
found
strangled
in
her
flat
and
all
her
jewellery
taken
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
Banfield
charges
you
with
the
crime
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
admit
that
I
was
in
the
apartment
when
the
crime
was
committed
--
decoyed
there
for
that
purpose
--
but
I
am
not
the
culprit
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
surely
you
could
prove
the
identity
of
the
assassin
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
saw
him
for
an
instant
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
no
knowledge
of
who
he
was
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
why
do
you
fear
this
American
crook
?
<EOS>
Why
not
dissociate
yourself
from
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
it
would
mean
my
betrayal
and
ruin
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
means
of
disproving
this
dastardly
allegation
.
<EOS>
I
am
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
love
him
,
perhaps
?
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
,
my
gaze
full
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Love
him
!
"
<EOS>
she
protested
,
with
flashing
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
I
hate
him
!
"
<EOS>
And
she
went
on
to
explain
how
she
was
held
powerless
in
the
hands
of
the
scoundrel
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
lover
,
I
understand
,
mademoiselle
?
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
presently
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
silent
,
but
about
the
corners
of
her
pretty
mouth
there
played
a
slight
smile
which
told
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
not
cut
yourself
adrift
from
this
life
of
yours
?
<EOS>
"
I
urged
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
be
your
friend
and
assist
you
against
this
fellow
Banfield
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
could
you
assist
me
?
<EOS>
He
knows
what
you
are
,
and
would
denounce
you
instantly
!
"
 
<EOS>
What
she
said
was
certainly
a
very
awkward
truth
.
<EOS>
Banfield
was
one
of
the
cleverest
scoundrels
in
Europe
,
an
unscrupulous
man
who
,
by
reason
of
certain
sharp
deals
,
had
become
possessed
of
very
considerable
wealth
,
his
criminal
methods
being
always
most
carefully
concealed
.
<EOS>
The
police
knew
him
to
be
a
swindler
,
but
there
was
never
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
.
 
<EOS>
To
obtain
Suzette
's
services
<EOS>
I
would
,
I
saw
,
be
compelled
to
propitiate
him
.
 
<EOS>
Alone
there
,
beneath
the
softly
murmuring
trees
,
I
stretched
forth
my
hand
across
the
table
and
took
her
neatly
gloved
fingers
in
mine
,
saying
:
 
"
Suzette
,
what
I
am
you
already
know
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
cosmopolitan
,
perhaps
unscrupulous
,
as
a
man
occupied
as
I
am
must
needs
be
.
<EOS>
I
am
an
Englishman
and
,
I
hope
,
a
patriot
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
trust
I
have
always
been
chivalrous
towards
a
woman
.
<EOS>
You
are
,
I
see
,
oppressed
--
held
in
a
bondage
that
is
hateful----
"
 
<EOS>
At
my
words
she
burst
into
tears
,
holding
my
hand
convulsively
in
hers
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
I
said
in
a
voice
of
sympathy
.
<EOS>
"
The
professions
of
neither
of
us
are
--
well
,
exactly
honourable
,
are
they
?
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
let
us
be
friends
.
<EOS>
I
want
your
assistance
,
and
in
return
I
will
assist
you
.
<EOS>
Let
us
be
frank
and
open
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
I
will
explain
the
truth
and
rely
upon
your
secrecy
.
<EOS>
Listen

<EOS>
In
Berlin
certain
negotiations
are
at
this
moment
in
active
progress
with
St.
Petersburg
and
New
York
,
with
the
object
of
forming
an
offensive
alliance
against
England
.
<EOS>
This
would
mean
that
in
the
coming
war
,
which
is
inevitable
,
my
country
must
meet
not
only
her
fiercest
enemy
,
Germany
,
but
also
the
United
States
and
Russia
.
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
believe
that
matters
have
secretly
progressed
until
they
are
very
near
a
settlement
.
<EOS>
What
I
desire
to
know
is
the
actual
inducement
held
out
by
the
Kaiser
's
Foreign
Office
.
<EOS>
Do
you
follow
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
,
"
she
said
,
at
once
attentive
.
<EOS>
"
I
quite
recognise
the
danger
to
your
country
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
danger
is
to
France
also
,
"
I
pointed
out
.
"
<EOS>
For
the
past
six
months
an
active
exchange
of
despatches
has
been
in
progress
,
but
so
carefully
has
the
truth
been
concealed
that
only
by
sheer
accident
--
a
word
let
drop
in
a
drawing
-
room
in
London
--
I
scented
what
was
in
the
wind
.
<EOS>
Then
I
at
once
saw
that
you
,
Suzette
,
was
the
only
person
who
could
assist
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
an
expert
in
the
art
of
prying
into
despatch
-
boxes
,
"
I
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
Berlin
,
at
the
Kaiserhof
Hotel
,
there
is
staying
a
certain
Charles
Pierron
.
<EOS>
If
any
one
is
aware
of
the
truth
that
man
is
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
go
to
Berlin
,
make
his
acquaintance
,
and
learn
what
he
knows
.
<EOS>
If
what
I
suspect
be
true
,
he
possesses
copies
of
the
despatches
emanating
from
the
German
Foreign
Office
.
<EOS>
And
of
these
I
must
obtain
a
glimpse
at
all
hazards
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
this
Pierron
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
at
the
'
Angleterre
,
'
in
Copenhagen
,
when
you
were
there
,
but
I
do
not
think
you
saw
him
.
<EOS>
The
reason
of
my
presence
there
was
because
I
chanced
to
be
interested
in
his
movements
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
he
--
an
undesirable
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
undesirable
as
I
am
myself
,
mademoiselle
,
<EOS>
"
I
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
a
French
secret
agent
--
an
Anglophobe
to
his
finger
-
tips
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
m'sieur
,
"
she
exclaimed
;
"
you
desire
me
to
adopt
the
profession
of
the
spy
with
the
kid
glove
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
nodded
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pierron
knows
me
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
already
has
good
cause
to
remember
me
in
England
,
where
he
acted
as
a
spy
of
Germany
,
"
I
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
always
impressionable
where
the
fair
sex
is
concerned
,
and
you
will
,
I
feel
confident
,
quickly
be
successful
if
you
lived
for
a
few
days
at
the
'
Kaiserhof
'
as
Vera
Yermoloff
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
was
silent
,
apparently
reflecting
deeply
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
prepared
,
of
course
,
to
offer
you
a
monetary
consideration
,
"
I
added
in
a
low
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
monetary
consideration
is
needed
,
m'sieur
,
"
was
her
quick
response
.
"
<EOS>
In
return
for
the
fraud
I
practised
upon
you
,
it
is
only
just
that
I
should
render
you
this
service
.
<EOS>
Yet
without
Banfield
's
knowledge
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
I
dare
not
leave
Paris
without
his
permission
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
must
go
with
his
knowledge
--
make
up
some
story
--
a
relative
ill
or
something
--
to
account
for
your
journey
to
Berlin
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
seemed
undecided
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
repeated
my
suggestion
,
well
knowing
that
the
sweet
-
faced
girl
could
,
if
she
wished
,
obtain
for
us
the
knowledge
which
would
place
power
in
the
hands
of
Great
Britain
--
power
to
upset
the
machinations
of
our
enemies
.
 
<EOS>
Mine
was
becoming
a
profession
full
of
subterfuge
.
 
<EOS>
Her
breast
heaved
and
fell
in
a
long
-
drawn
sigh
.
<EOS>
I
saw
that
she
was
wavering
.
 
<EOS>
She
sipped
her
tea
in
silence
,
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
shady
trees
opposite
.
 
<EOS>
"
Suzette
,
"
I
exclaimed
at
last
,
"
your
lover
's
name
is
Armand
Thomas
,
clerk
at
the
head
office
of
the
Compte
d'Escompte
.
<EOS>
He
believes
you
to
be
the
niece
of
the
rich
American
,
Henry
Banfield
,
little
dreaming
of
your
real
position
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
that
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
smiled
,
telling
her
that
I
had
made
it
my
business
to
discover
the
facts
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
love
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
looking
her
straight
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
was
her
serious
response
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
kept
this
love
affair
secret
from
Banfield
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
.
<EOS>
If
he
knew
the
truth
he
would
be
enraged
.
<EOS>
He
has
always
forbidden
me
to
fall
in
love
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
he
fears
that
your
lover
may
act
as
your
protector
and
shield
you
from
his
evil
influence
,
"
I
remarked
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Suzette
,
"
I
added
,
"
you
are
a
very
clever
girl
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
successful
on
this
mission
<EOS>
I
will
,
I
promise
,
find
a
means
of
uniting
you
with
your
lover
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
sadly
,
replying
:
 
<EOS>
"
Remember
Banfield
's
threat
.
<EOS>
Disobedience
of
any
of
his
commands
will
mean
my
ruin
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
knows
who
and
what
you
are
.
<EOS>
Therefore
how
can
you
assist
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
,
"
I
said
,
again
extending
my
hand
to
my
dainty
little
friend
,
"
I
make
you
this
promise
not
only
on
my
own
behalf
--
but
also
on
behalf
of
my
country
,
England
.
<EOS>
Is
it
a
compact
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
really
believe
you
can
help
me
to
free
myself
of
my
hateful
bond
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
bending
towards
me
with
eager
anticipation
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
Suzette
,
that
in
return
for
this
service
you
shall
be
free
.
"
 
<EOS>
Tears
again
stood
in
those
fine
dark
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
knew
of
her
secret
affection
for
young
Thomas
,
the
hard
-
working
bank
clerk
,
who
dared
not
aspire
to
the
hand
of
the
niece
of
the
great
American
financier
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
narrative
of
subterfuge
and
adventure
the
delightful
little
girl
seated
there
before
me
could
write
!
<EOS>
The
small
amount
I
knew
was
amazingly
romantic
.
<EOS>
Some
of
Banfield
's
smartest
financial
_
coups
_
had
been
accomplished
owing
to
her
clever
manoeuvring
and
to
the
information
she
had
gained
by
her
almost
childish
artlessness
.
<EOS>
Surely
the
British
Government
could
have
no
more
ingenious
seeker
after
political
secrets
than
she
.
<EOS>
Women
are
always
more
successful
as
spies
than
men
.
<EOS>
That
is
why
so
many
are
employed
by
both
Germany
and
France
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
the
varied
adventures
in
my
search
after
spies
I
had
never
met
a
girl
with
a
stranger
history
than
Suzette
Darbour
.
<EOS>
That
she
had
actually
imposed
upon
me
was
in
itself
,
I
think
,
sufficient
evidence
of
her
wit
,
cunning
,
and
innate
ability
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
rose
from
the
table
and
strolled
back
to
where
we
had
left
the
"
auto
,
"
it
was
with
the
knowledge
that
my
long
search
had
not
been
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
had
taken
my
hand
in
promise
to
go
to
the
"
Kaiserhof
"
in
Berlin
and
pry
into
the
papers
of
that
foremost
of
secret
agents
,
Charles
Pierron
.
 
<EOS>
At
five
o'clock
next
morning
I
was
back
again
in
London
,
and
at
ten
I
was
seated
in
conference
with
Ray
Raymond
in
his
cosy
flat
in
Bruton
Street
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
get
at
the
terms
offered
by
the
Germans
,
Jacox
,
"
he
declared
,
snapping
his
fingers
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
imperative
that
the
Foreign
Office
should
know
them
.
<EOS>
At
present
our
hands
are
utterly
tied
.
<EOS>
We
are
unable
to
act
,
and
our
diplomacy
is
at
a
complete
standstill
.
<EOS>
The
situation
is
dangerous
--
distinctly
dangerous
.
<EOS>
The
guv'nor
was
only
saying
so
last
night
.
<EOS>
Once
the
agreement
is
signed
,
then
good
-
bye
for
ever
to
Britain
's
power
and
prestige
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
explained
that
so
carefully
was
the
secret
preserved
that
I
had
been
unable
to
discover
anything
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
had
hopes
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Jack
,
England
relies
entirely
upon
you
,
"
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
know
the
plans
of
our
enemies
if
we
are
successfully
to
combat
them
.
<EOS>
In
the
past
you
've
often
done
marvels
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
hope
that
you
will
be
equally
successful
in
this
critical
moment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Then
after
a
long
and
confidential
chat
we
parted
and
<EOS>
a
couple
of
hours
later
I
was
again
in
the
boat
train
,
bound
for
the
Continent
.
<EOS>
I
recognised
how
urgent
was
the
matter
,
and
how
each
hour
's
delay
increased
our
peril
.
 
<EOS>
The
public
,
or
rather
the
omnivorous
readers
of
the
halfpenny
press
,
little
dream
<EOS>
how
near
we
were
at
that
moment
to
disaster
.
<EOS>
The
completion
of
the
cleverly
laid
plans
of
Germany
would
mean
a
sudden
blow
aimed
at
us
,
not
only
at
our
own
shores
,
but
also
at
our
colonies
at
the
same
moment
--
and
such
a
blow
,
with
our
weakened
army
and
neglected
navy
,
we
could
not
possibly
ward
off
.
 
<EOS>
Well
I
remember
how
that
night
I
sat
in
the
corner
of
the
_
wagon
-
lit
_
of
the
Simplon
Express
and
reflected
deeply
.
<EOS>
I
was
on
my
way
to
Milan
to
join
a
friend
.
<EOS>
At
Boulogne
I
had
received
a
wire
from
Suzette
,
who
had
already
departed
on
her
mission
to
Berlin
.
 
<EOS>
My
chief
difficulty
lay
in
the
unfortunate
fact
that
I
was
well
known
to
Pierron
,
who
had
now
forsaken
his
original
employers
the
Germans
,
hence
I
dare
not
go
to
the
German
capital
,
lest
he
should
recognise
me
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
in
the
pay
of
the
French
Secret
Service
was
a
clerk
in
the
Treaty
department
of
the
German
Foreign
Office
,
and
without
doubt
he
was
furnishing
Pierron
with
copies
of
all
the
correspondence
in
progress
.
<EOS>
Both
the
French
and
German
Governments
spend
six
times
the
amount
annually
upon
secret
service
that
we
do
,
hence
they
are
always
well
and
accurately
informed
.
 
<EOS>
At
Milan
next
day
the
porter
at
the
"
Metropole
,
"
the
small
hotel
in
the
Piazza
del
Duomo
where
I
always
stay
,
handed
me
a
telegram
,
a
cipher
message
from
Ray
,
which
announced
that
his
father
had
discovered
that
,
according
to
a
despatch
just
received
from
His
Majesty
's
Ambassador
at
St.
Petersburg
,
there
was
now
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
terms
offered
by
Germany
were
extremely
advantageous
to
both
Russia
and
the
United
States
,
and
that
it
was
believed
that
the
agreement
was
on
the
actual
point
of
being
concluded
.
 
<EOS>
That
decided
me
.
<EOS>
I
felt
that
at
all
hazards
,
even
though
Pierron
might
detect
my
presence
,
I
must
be
in
Berlin
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
,
however
,
unable
to
leave
Milan
at
once
,
for
Ford
,
whom
I
was
awaiting
,
was
on
his
way
from
Corfu
and
had
telegraphed
saying
that
he
had
missed
the
mail
train
at
Brindisi
,
and
would
not
arrive
before
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
So
all
that
day
I
was
compelled
to
hang
about
Milan
,
drinking
vermouth
and
bitter
at
Biffi
's
cafe
in
the
Galleria
,
and
dining
alone
at
Salvini
's
.
<EOS>
I
always
hate
Milan
,
for
it
is
the
noisiest
and
most
uninteresting
city
in
all
Italy
.
 
<EOS>
Next
afternoon
I
met
Ford
at
the
station
and
compelled
him
to
scramble
into
the
Bale
express
with
me
,
directly
after
he
had
alighted
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
go
to
Berlin
.
<EOS>
You
come
with
me
,
and
go
on
to
St.
Petersburg
,
"
I
said
in
reply
to
his
questions
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
middle
-
aged
man
,
a
retired
army
officer
and
a
perfect
linguist
,
who
was
a
secret
agent
of
the
British
Government
and
a
great
friend
of
Ray
's
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
way
on
that
long
,
tedious
run
to
Berlin
we
discussed
the
situation
.
<EOS>
I
was
the
first
to
explain
to
him
our
imminent
peril
,
and
with
what
craft
and
cunning
the
German
Chancellor
had
formed
his
plans
for
the
defeat
and
downfall
of
our
Empire
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
knew
,
all
trace
of
fatigue
vanished
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
went
along
the
corridor
,
washed
,
put
on
a
fresh
collar
,
brushed
his
well
-
worn
suit
of
navy
serge
,
and
returned
spruce
and
smart
,
ready
for
any
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
nothing
of
Suzette
.
<EOS>
Her
existence
I
had
resolved
to
keep
to
myself
.
<EOS>
In
going
to
Berlin
<EOS>
I
knew
well
that
I
was
playing
both
a
dangerous
and
desperate
game
.
<EOS>
Pierron
hated
me
,
and
if
he
detected
me
,
he
might
very
easily
denounce
me
to
the
police
as
a
spy
.
<EOS>
Such
a
_
contretemps
_
<EOS>
would
,
I
reflected
,
mean
for
me
ten
years
'
confinement
in
a
fortress
.
<EOS>
The
German
authorities
would
certainly
not
forget
how
for
the
past
two
years
I
had
hunted
their
agents
up
and
down
Great
Britain
,
and
been
the
means
of
deporting
several
as
undesirable
aliens
.
 
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
felt
,
somehow
,
that
my
place
was
near
Suzette
,
so
that
I
could
prompt
her
,
and
if
she
were
successful
I
could
read
with
my
own
eyes
the
copies
of
the
diplomatic
correspondence
from
the
German
Foreign
Office
.
 
<EOS>
On
arrival
at
Berlin
I
bade
Ford
farewell
,
having
given
him
certain
instructions
how
to
act
on
arrival
in
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
During
our
journey
we
had
made
up
a
special
telegraph
code
,
and
when
I
grasped
his
hand
<EOS>
he
said
:
 
"
<EOS>
Well
,
good
luck
,
Jacox
.
<EOS>
Be
careful
.
<EOS>
_
Au
revoir
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
hurried
along
the
platform
to
catch
the
Nord
Express
to
bear
him
to
the
Russian
capital
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
"
Kaiserhof
"
I
took
a
sitting
room
and
bed
-
room
adjoining
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
about
ten
o'clock
at
night
;
therefore
I
sat
down
and
wrote
a
note
to
"
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Vera
Yermoloff
,
"
which
I
gave
a
waiter
to
deliver
.
 
<EOS>
Ten
minutes
later
I
received
a
scribbled
reply
,
requesting
me
to
meet
her
at
half
-
past
ten
at
a
certain
cafe
near
the
Lehrte
Station
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
awaiting
her
when
she
arrived
.
<EOS>
After
she
had
greeted
me
and
expressed
surprise
at
my
sudden
appearance
,
she
informed
me
she
had
not
yet
met
Pierron
,
for
he
was
absent
--
<EOS>
in
Hamburg
it
was
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hear
he
returns
to
-
night
,
"
she
added
.
<EOS>
"
Therefore
,
I
hope
to
meet
him
to
-
morrow
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
explained
the
extreme
urgency
of
the
matter
,
and
then
drove
her
back
to
the
hotel
,
alighting
from
the
cab
a
few
hundred
yards
away
.
<EOS>
To
another
cafe
I
strolled
to
rest
and
have
a
smoke
,
and
it
was
near
midnight
when
I
re
-
entered
the
"
Kaiserhof
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
I
crossed
the
great
hall
a
_
contretemps
_
occurred
.
<EOS>
I
came
face
to
face
with
Pierron
,
a
tall
,
sallow
-
faced
,
red
-
bearded
man
with
eyes
set
close
together
,
elegantly
dressed
,
and
wearing
a
big
diamond
in
his
cravat
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
he
recognised
me
,
whereupon
I
bowed
,
saying
:
 
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
m'sieur
!
<EOS>
It
is
really
quite
a
long
time
since
we
met
--
in
Denmark
last
,
was
it
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
raised
his
eyebrows
slightly
,
and
replied
in
a
withering
tone
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
by
what
right
m'sieur
presumes
to
address
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
That
moment
required
all
my
courage
and
self
-
possession
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
expected
to
meet
him
so
suddenly
.
<EOS>
He
had
evidently
just
come
from
his
journey
,
for
he
wore
a
light
travelling
-
coat
and
soft
felt
hat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
--
something
to
tell
you
in
private
,
if
you
could
grant
me
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
I
merely
said
this
in
order
to
gain
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
Bien
!
<EOS>
_
to
-
morrow
,
then
--
at
whatever
hour
m'sieur
may
name
.
"
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
It
would
then
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
In
an
hour
he
might
inform
the
police
,
and
I
would
find
myself
under
arrest
.
<EOS>
The
German
police
would
be
only
too
pleased
to
have
an
opportunity
of
retaliating
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
I
exclaimed
.
"
<EOS>
To
-
night
.
<EOS>
Now
.
<EOS>
Our
business
will
only
take
a
few
moments
.
<EOS>
Come
to
my
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
matter
I
want
to
explain
brooks
no
delay
.
<EOS>
Every
moment
is
of
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
laughed
the
Frenchman
,
with
a
distinct
air
of
bravado
.
"
You
believe
yourself
extremely
clever
,
no
doubt
,
M'sieur
Jacox
.
<EOS>
Let
me
hear
what
you
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Together
we
ascended
the
broad
marble
steps
to
the
first
floor
,
and
I
held
open
the
door
of
my
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
entered
,
I
closed
it
,
and
offering
him
a
chair
,
commenced
in
a
resolute
tone
:
 
"
Now
,
M'sieur
Pierron
,
I
am
here
to
offer
terms
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Terms
!
"
<EOS>
he
laughed
.
"
<EOS>
_
Diable
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
I
foresee
your
evil
intention
against
myself
,
because
of
my
success
in
the
Brest
affair
,
"
was
my
quick
reply
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
denounce
me
here
in
Germany
as
a
British
agent
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
perfectly
correct
in
your
surmise
,
m'sieur
.
<EOS>
Here
they
have
an
unpleasant
habit
in
their
treatment
of
foreign
spies
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
does
it
not
usually
take
two
persons
to
play
a
game
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
perfectly
cool
.
"
<EOS>
Are
you
not
a
spy
also
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Go
to
the
police
,
_
mon
cher
ami
_
,
and
tell
them
what
you
will
,
"
he
laughed
defiantly
.
<EOS>
"
Straus
,
the
chief
of
police
here
,
is
my
friend
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
be
the
first
person
who
has
tried
to
secure
my
arrest
and
failed
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
words
confounded
me
.
<EOS>
I
saw
that
I
alone
was
in
peril
,
and
that
he
,
by
reason
of
his
personal
friendship
with
the
chief
of
police
,
was
immune
from
arrest
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
walked
deliberately
,
and
with
eyes
wide
open
,
into
the
trap
!
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
he
laughed
,
pointing
to
the
telephone
instrument
on
the
little
writing
-
table
,
"
<EOS>
I
have
only
to
take
that
and
call
up
the
police
office
,
and
your
British
Government
will
lose
the
services
of
one
of
its
shrewdest
agents
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
that
is
your
revenge
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
realising
how
utterly
helpless
I
now
was
in
the
hands
of
my
bitterest
enemy
--
the
man
who
had
turned
a
traitor
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
no
way
out
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
"
<EOS>
he
laughed
in
my
face
.
<EOS>
"
The
power
of
your
wonderful
old
country
--
so
old
that
it
has
become
worm
-
eaten
--
is
already
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
In
a
month
you
will
have
German
soldiers
swarming
upon
your
shores
,
while
America
will
seize
Canada
and
Australia
,
and
Russia
will
advance
into
India
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
crushed
,
beaten
,
humiliated
--
and
the
German
eagle
will
fly
over
your
proud
London
.
<EOS>
The
John
Bull
bladder
is
to
be
pricked
!
"
<EOS>
he
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
not
exactly
news
to
me
,
M'sieur
Pierron
,
<EOS>
"
I
answered
quite
coolly
.
"
<EOS>
The
danger
of
my
country
is
equally
a
danger
to
yours
.
<EOS>
With
England
crushed
,
France
,
too
,
must
fall
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
an
army
--
a
brave
army
--
while
you
have
only
the
skeleton
that
your
great
Haldane
has
left
to
you
,
"
he
sneered
.
"
<EOS>
But
enough
!
<EOS>
I
have
long
desired
this
interview
,
and
am
pleased
that
it
has
taken
place
here
in
Berlin
,
"
and
he
deliberately
walked
across
to
the
telephone
.
 
<EOS>
I
tried
to
snatch
the
transmitter
from
his
hand
,
but
though
we
struggled
,
he
succeeded
in
inquiring
for
a
number
--
<EOS>
the
number
of
the
police
head
-
quarters
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
caught
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
,
fool
that
I
was
to
have
come
there
at
risk
of
my
liberty
--
I
who
was
always
so
wary
and
so
circumspect
!
 
<EOS>
I
sprang
at
his
throat
,
to
prevent
him
speaking
further
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
do
this
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
reply
was
only
a
hoarse
laugh
of
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
asking
for
somebody
--
his
friend
,
the
chief
of
police
!
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
me
with
a
laugh
,
he
said
:
 
"
Straus
will
undoubtedly
be
pleased
to
arrest
such
big
game
as
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
uttered
the
words
there
sounded
a
low
tap
upon
the
door
,
and
next
second
it
opened
,
revealing
the
neat
figure
in
pale
blue
.
 
<EOS>
Pierron
turned
quickly
,
but
in
an
instant
his
face
was
blanched
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
Dieu
!
<EOS>
Suzette
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
he
gasped
,
staring
at
her
,
while
she
stood
upon
the
threshold
,
a
strange
look
overspreading
her
countenance
as
she
recognised
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Look
,
M'sieur
Jacox
!
<EOS>
"
she
shrieked
a
second
later
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
--
yes
,
it
is
that
man
!
"
<EOS>
she
went
on
,
pointing
her
finger
at
him
.
"
<EOS>
At
last
!
<EOS>
Thank
God
!
<EOS>
I
have
found
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
I
demanded
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
M'sieur
Pierron
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
"
she
cried
,
"
that
is
the
man
whom
I
saw
at
the
Rue
de
Royat
--
the
man
who
strangled
poor
Madame
Levitsky
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
lie
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
stepping
towards
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
--
I've
never
seen
you
before
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
yet
you
have
just
uttered
mademoiselle
's
name
,
m'sieur
,
"
I
remarked
quietly
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
knows
that
I
was
present
at
the
time
of
the
tragedy
,
"
exclaimed
Suzette
quickly
,
"
and
that
he
was
the
paid
assassin
of
Henry
Banfield
.
<EOS>
He
killed
the
unfortunate
woman
for
two
reasons
:
first
,
in
order
to
obtain
her
husband
's
papers
,
which
had
both
political
and
financial
importance
;
and
secondly
,
to
obtain
her
jewellery
,
which
was
of
very
considerable
value
.
<EOS>
And
upon
me
,
because
I
was
defenceless
,
the
guilt
was
placed
.
<EOS>
They
said
I
was
jealous
of
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Suzette
,
"
I
said
slowly
,
"
leave
this
man
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Then
,
glancing
towards
him
,
I
saw
what
a
terrible
effect
her
denunciation
had
had
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Pale
to
the
lips
,
he
stood
cowed
,
even
trembling
,
for
before
him
<EOS>
was
the
living
witness
of
his
crime
.
 
<EOS>
I
stood
with
my
back
to
the
door
,
barring
his
escape
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
I
said
,
"
what
is
your
defence
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
silent
.
 
<EOS>
I
repeated
my
question
in
a
hard
,
distinct
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
's
cry
quits
,
"
he
said
in
a
low
,
hoarse
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
preserve
your
secret
--
if
you
will
keep
mine
.
<EOS>
Will
you
not
accept
terms
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
those
,
"
I
replied
promptly
.
<EOS>
"
Suzette
has
been
accused
by
Banfield
,
and
by
you
,
of
the
crime
which
you
committed
.
<EOS>
She
shall
therefore
name
her
own
terms
.
"
 
<EOS>
Realising
that
,
by
the
fortunate
discovery
of
the
assassin
of
Madame
Levitsky
,
she
had
at
once
freed
herself
from
the
trammels
cast
about
her
by
Banfield
,
it
was
not
surprising
that
the
girl
should
stipulate
as
a
condition
of
allowing
the
spy
his
freedom
that
he
should
hand
over
to
me
all
the
copies
of
the
secret
diplomatic
correspondence
which
he
possessed
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
he
loudly
protested
that
he
had
none
,
but
I
compelled
him
to
hand
me
the
key
of
his
despatch
-
box
,
and
accompanying
him
to
his
room
at
the
further
end
of
the
corridor
,
we
searched
and
there
found
within
the
steel
box
a
file
of
papers
which
he
held
ready
to
hand
over
to
the
Quai
d'Orsay
--
the
actual
information
of
which
I
had
been
in
such
active
search
.
 
<EOS>
The
German
inducements
were
all
set
out
clearly
and
concisely
,
the
copies
being
in
the
neat
hand
of
the
traitorous
clerk
in
the
Treaty
Department
.
 
<EOS>
Pierron
,
the
tables
thus
turned
upon
him
,
begged
me
to
allow
him
at
least
to
have
copies
.
<EOS>
This
I
refused
,
triumphantly
taking
possession
of
the
whole
file
and
bidding
him
good
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
hour
we
had
both
left
the
German
capital
,
and
next
day
I
had
the
satisfaction
of
handing
the
copy
of
the
German
proposals
and
the
whole
correspondence
to
the
Minister
for
Foreign
Affairs
at
Downing
Street
.
 
<EOS>
An
extraordinary
meeting
of
the
Cabinet
was
held
,
and
cipher
instructions
at
once
sent
to
each
of
His
Majesty
's
Ambassadors
abroad
--
instructions
which
had
the
result
of
successfully
combating
the
intrigue
at
Berlin
,
and
for
the
time
being
breaking
up
the
proposed
powerful
combination
against
us
.
 
<EOS>
The
bitter
chagrin
of
the
German
Chancellor
is
well
known
in
diplomatic
circles
,
yet
to
Suzette
Darbour
<EOS>
our
kid
-
gloved
_
coup
_
meant
her
freedom
.
 
<EOS>
In
my
presence
she
openly
defied
Henry
Banfield
and
cut
herself
adrift
from
him
,
while
Charles
Pierron
,
after
his
ignominious
failure
in
Berlin
,
and
possibly
on
account
of
certain
allegations
made
by
the
rich
American
,
who
wished
to
get
rid
of
him
,
was
dismissed
from
the
French
Secret
Service
and
disappeared
,
while
the
pretty
Suzette
,
three
months
afterwards
,
married
Armand
Thomas
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
present
at
the
quiet
wedding
out
at
Melun
in
the
first
days
of
1909
,
being
the
bearer
of
a
costly
present
in
the
form
of
a
pretty
diamond
pendant
,
as
well
as
a
dozen
pairs
of
sixteen
-
button
-
length
kid
gloves
from
an
anonymous
donor
.
 
<EOS>
She
alone
knew
that
the
pendant
had
been
sent
to
her
as
a
mark
of
gratitude
by
the
grave
-
faced
old
peer
,
the
confirmed
woman
-
hater
,
who
was
Minister
for
Foreign
Affairs
of
His
Majesty
King
Edward
the
Seventh
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
once
lately
I
have
been
a
welcome
visitor

CHAPTER
IX
 
<EOS>
THE
SECRET
OF
OUR
NEW
GUN
  
Ray
<EOS>
and
I
were
in
Newcastle
-
on
-
Tyne
a
few
weeks
after
our
success
in
frustrating
the
German
plot
against
England
.
 
<EOS>
Certain
observations
we
had
kept
had
led
us
to
believe
that
a
frantic
endeavour
was
being
made
to
obtain
certain
details
of
a
new
type
of
gun
,
of
enormous
power
and
range
,
which
at
that
moment
was
under
construction
at
the
Armstrong
Works
at
Elswick
.
 
<EOS>
The
Tyne
and
Tees
have
long
ago
been
surveyed
by
Germany
,
and
no
doubt
the
accurate
and
detailed
information
pigeon
-
holed
in
the
Intelligence
Bureau
at
Berlin
<EOS>
would
,
if
seen
by
the
good
people
of
Newcastle
,
cause
them
a
_
mauvais
quart
d'heure
_
,
as
well
as
<EOS>
considerable
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
there
are
one
or
two
secrets
of
the
Tyne
and
its
defences
which
are
fortunately
not
yet
the
property
of
our
friends
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
Vera
was
in
Switzerland
with
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
But
from
our
quarters
at
the
Station
Hotel
in
Newcastle
we
made
many
careful
and
confidential
inquiries
.
<EOS>
We
discovered
,
among
other
things
,
the
existence
of
a
secret
German
club
in
a
back
street
off
Grainger
Street
,
and
the
members
of
this
institution
we
watched
narrowly
.
 
<EOS>
Now
no
British
workman
will
willingly
give
away
any
secret
to
a
foreign
Power
,
and
we
did
not
suspect
that
any
one
employed
at
the
great
Elswick
Works
would
be
guilty
of
treachery
.
<EOS>
In
these
days
of
socialistic
,
fire
-
brand
oratory
there
is
always
,
however
,
the
danger
of
a
discharged
workman
making
revelations
with
objects
of
private
vengeance
,
never
realising
that
it
is
a
nation
's
secrets
that
he
may
be
betraying
.
<EOS>
Yet
in
the
course
of
a
fortnight
's
inquiry
we
learned
nothing
to
lead
us
to
suspect
that
our
enemies
would
obtain
the
information
they
sought
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
members
of
the
secret
German
club
--
which
,
by
the
way
,
included
in
its
membership
several
Swiss
and
Belgians
--
was
a
middle
-
aged
man
who
went
by
the
name
of
John
Barker
,
but
who
was
either
a
German
or
a
Swede
,
and
whose
real
name
most
probably
ended
in
"
burger
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
,
we
found
,
employed
as
foreign
-
correspondence
clerk
in
the
offices
of
a
well
-
known
shipping
firm
,
and
amateur
photography
seemed
his
chief
hobby
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
number
of
friends
,
one
of
whom
was
a
man
named
Charles
Rosser
,
a
highly
respectable
,
hardworking
man
,
who
was
a
foreman
fitter
at
Elswick
.
 
<EOS>
We
watched
the
pair
closely
,
for
our
suspicions
were
at
last
aroused
.
 
<EOS>
Rosser
often
spent
the
evening
with
his
friend
Barker
at
theatres
and
music
-
halls
,
and
it
was
evident
that
the
shipping
clerk
paid
for
everything
.
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
Barker
went
out
to
Rosser
's
house
in
Dilston
Road
,
close
to
the
Nun
's
Moor
Recreation
Ground
,
and
there
spent
the
evening
with
his
wife
and
family
.
 
<EOS>
We
took
turns
at
keeping
observation
,
but
one
night
Ray
,
who
had
been
out
following
the
pair
,
entered
my
room
at
the
hotel
,
saying
:
 
"
Barker
is
persuading
his
friend
to
buy
a
new
house
in
the
Bentinck
Road
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
small
,
neat
little
red
-
brick
villa
,
just
completed
,
and
the
price
is
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
to
-
night
I
overheard
part
of
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
Barker
actually
offers
to
lend
his
friend
half
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
.
<EOS>
"
On
certain
conditions
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
conditions
were
mentioned
,
but
,
no
doubt
,
he
intends
to
get
poor
Rosser
into
his
toils
,
that
he
'll
be
compelled
to
supply
some
information
in
order
to
save
himself
and
his
family
from
ruin
.
<EOS>
The
spies
of
Germany
are
quite
unscrupulous
,
remember
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
quite
clear
.
<EOS>
We
must
protect
Rosser
from
this
.
<EOS>
He
's
no
doubt
tempting
the
unsuspecting
fellow
,
and
posing
as
a
man
of
means
.
<EOS>
Rosser
does
n't
know
that
his
generous
friend
is
a
spy
.
"
 
<EOS>
For
the
next
few
days
it
fell
to
my
lot
to
watch
Barker
.
<EOS>
I
followed
him
on
Saturday
afternoon
to
Tynemouth
,
where
it
seemed
his
hobby
was
to
snap
-
shot
incoming
and
outgoing
ships
at
the
estuary
,
at
the
same
time
asking
of
seafaring
men
in
the
vicinity
how
far
the
boat
would
be
from
the
shore
where
he
was
standing
.
 
<EOS>
Both
part
of
that
afternoon
and
part
of
Sunday
<EOS>
he
was
engaged
in
taking
some
measurements
near
the
Ridges
Reservoir
,
North
Shields
,
afterwards
going
on
to
Tynemouth
again
,
and
snap
-
shotting
the
castle
from
various
positions
,
the
railway
and
its
tunnels
,
the
various
slips
,
the
jetty
,
the
fish
quay
,
the
harbour
,
and
the
Narrows
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
seemed
to
be
making
a
most
careful
photographic
survey
of
the
whole
town
.
 
<EOS>
He
carried
with
him
a
memorandum
book
,
in
which
he
made
many
notes
.
<EOS>
All
this
he
did
openly
,
in
full
presence
of
passers
-
by
,
and
even
of
the
police
,
for
who
suspects
German
spies
in
Tynemouth
?
 
<EOS>
About
six
o'clock
on
Sunday
afternoon
he
entered
the
Royal
Station
Hotel
,
took
off
his
light
overcoat
,
and
,
hanging
it
in
the
hall
,
went
into
the
coffee
-
room
to
order
tea
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
followed
him
in
order
to
have
tea
myself
,
and
I
took
off
my
own
overcoat
and
hung
it
up
next
to
his
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
did
not
enter
the
coffee
-
room
;
instead
,
I
went
into
the
smoking
-
room
.
<EOS>
There
I
called
for
a
drink
,
and
,
having
swallowed
it
,
returned
to
the
pegs
where
our
coats
were
hanging
.
 
<EOS>
Swiftly
I
placed
my
hand
in
the
breast
pocket
of
his
coat
,
and
there
felt
some
papers
which
,
in
a
second
,
I
had
seized
and
transferred
to
my
own
pocket
.
<EOS>
Then
I
put
on
my
coat
leisurely
,
and
strolled
across
to
the
station
.

]
 
<EOS>
A
train
was
fortunately
just
about
to
leave
for
Newcastle
,
and
I
jumped
in
.
<EOS>
Then
when
we
had
moved
away
from
the
platform
I
eagerly
examined
what
I
had
secured
.
 
<EOS>
It
consisted
of
a
tipster
's
circular
,
some
newspaper
cuttings
concerning
football
,
a
rough
sketch
of
how
the
water
supply
of
North
Shields
could
be
cut
off
,
and
a
private
letter
from
a
business
man
which
may
be
of
interest
if
I
reproduce
it
.
<EOS>
It
read
as
follows
:
      
"

I
herewith
enclose
the
interest
in
advance

just
now

I
am
glad
to

little

we
hope
that
next
year
your

may
     
be
increased

<EOS>
"
We

we
are
     
always
interested

<EOS>
"
It
is
unwise
of
you
,
I
think
,
to
doubt
Uncle
Charles
,
for
I
     
have
always
found
him
to
be
a
man
in
whom
one
can
repose
the
     
utmost
confidence
.
<EOS>
He
is
,
I
believe
,
taking
a

near
     
Tynemouth
.

Every
one
is
at
present
well

always

<EOS>
"
Your
affectionate

"
HENRY
LEWIS

"
 
That
letter
,
innocent
enough
upon
the
face
of
it
,
contained
certain
instructions
to
the
spy
,
besides
enclosing
his
monthly
payment
of
L20
.
 
<EOS>
Read
by
the
alphabetical
instructions
with
which
every
German
secret
agent
is
supplied
and
which
vary
in
various
districts
,
the
message
it
contained
was
as
follows
:
      
<EOS>
(
Phrase
I
)
<EOS>
I
send
you
your
monthly
payment
.
      
<EOS>
(
Phrase
2
)
<EOS>
Your
informations
during
the
past
month
are
     
satisfactory
.
      
<EOS>
(
Phrase
3
)
<EOS>
Your
service
in
general
is
giving
satisfaction
,
and
     
if
it
continues
so
,
we
shall
at
the
next
inspection
augment
     
<EOS>
your
monthly
payment
.
      
<EOS>
(
Phrase
4
)
<EOS>
We
wish
you
,
however
,
to
send
us
more
detailed
     
notes
,
and
report
oftener
.
      
<EOS>
(
Phrase
5
)
<EOS>
Cease
your
observations
upon
Charles
.
<EOS>
We
have
what
     
we
require
.
<EOS>
Turn
your
attention
to
defences
at
Tynemouth
.
      
<EOS>
(
Phrase
6
)
<EOS>
As
you
know
,
the
chief
(
spring
)
is
very
difficult
to
     
please
,
for
at
the
last
inspection
we
were
given
increased
     
work
.
      
<EOS>
(
Phrase
7
)
Remain
in
negotiation
with
your
three
     
correspondents
--
Charles
(
<EOS>
meaning
the
foreman
,
Rosser
)
,
     
Charlotte
,
and
Frederick
--
until
you
hear
further
.
<EOS>
You
may
make
     
them
offers
for
the
information
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
it
will
be
seen
that
any
one
into
whose
hands
this
letter
from
"
Henry
Lewis
"
fell
would
be
unable
to
ascertain
its
real
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
The
fictitious
Lewis
,
we
afterwards
discovered
,
occupied
a
small
office
in
Berkeley
Chambers
in
the
guise
of
a
commission
agent
,
but
was
no
doubt
the
travelling
agent
whose
actions
were
controllable
by
Hermann
Hartmann
,
but
who
in
turn
controlled
the
fixed
agents
of
that
district
lying
between
the
Humber
and
the
Tweed
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
these
travelling
agents
visit
their
fixed
agents
--
the
men
who
do
the
real
work
of
espionage
--
in
the
guise
of
a
commercial
traveller
if
the
agent
is
a
shopkeeper
,
or
if
he
is
not
,
he
will
represent
himself
as
a
client
or
an
insurance
agent
,
an
auctioneer
or
a
house
agent
.
<EOS>
This
last
_
metier
_
is
greatly
recommended
by
the
German
Secret
Police
as
the
best
mode
of
concealing
espionage
,
and
is
adopted
by
the
most
dangerous
and
ingenious
of
the
spies
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
returned
I
showed
my
treasures
to
Ray
,
who
at
once
became
excited
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
fellow
is
a
fixed
agent
here
in
Newcastle
,
no
doubt
,
"
he
declared
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
watch
him
well
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
continued
our
observations
.
<EOS>
The
spy
and
Rosser
were
inseparable
.
<EOS>
They
met
each
evening
,
and
more
than
once
the
whole
Rosser
family
went
out
to
entertainments
at
Mr.
Barker
's
expense
.
<EOS>
He
would
allow
the
foreman
fitter
to
pay
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Judicious
inquiries
at
Elswick
revealed
the
fact
that
Charles
Rosser
was
one
of
the
most
skilful
fitters
in
the
employ
of
the
firm
,
and
that
such
was
the
confidence
placed
in
him
,
that
he
was
at
present
engaged
in
the
finishing
of
the
new
gun
which
was
to
be
a
triumph
of
the
British
Navy
--
a
weapon
which
was
far
and
away
in
advance
of
any
possessed
by
any
other
nation
,
or
anything
ever
turned
out
from
Krupp
's
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
ticklish
and
exciting
work
,
watching
the
two
men
and
observing
the
subtle
craftiness
of
the
German
,
who
was
trying
to
get
the
honest
Englishman
into
his
power
.
<EOS>
But
in
our
self
-
imposed
campaign
of
contra
-
espionage
we
had
had
many
stirring
adventures
,
and
after
all
,
our
life
in
Newcastle
was
not
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
Barker
was
engaged
at
his
office
all
day
,
and
we
were
then
free
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
at
evening
when
we
were
compelled
to
adopt
those
hundred
and
one
subterfuges
,
and
whenever
the
watching
was
wearisome
and
chill
we
always
recollected
that
we
were
performing
a
patriotic
duty
,
even
though
it
be
silent
,
unknown
,
and
unrecognised
.
 
<EOS>
One
night
the
pair
were
together
in
a
bar
in
Westgate
Road
,
when
,
from
their
conversation
,
it
was
made
very
clear
to
me
that
Barker
had
advanced
his
friend
one
hundred
and
seventy
-
five
pounds
,
and
that
the
deeds
of
the
new
house
were
to
be
signed
next
day
.
<EOS>
Rosser
was
extremely
grateful
to
his
friend
.
<EOS>
Half
the
purchase
-
money
was
to
remain
on
mortgage
--
a
mortgage
made
over
to
Barker
himself
--
just
as
we
had
expected
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
clinked
glasses
,
and
it
was
plain
that
Rosser
had
not
the
least
suspicion
of
the
abyss
opened
before
him
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
men
who
are
entirely
unsuspecting
,
and
perhaps
the
British
workman
is
most
of
all
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
reported
this
to
Ray
and
we
had
consulted
together
,
we
decided
that
the
time
was
ripe
to
approach
Rosser
and
expose
his
generous
friend
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
now
quite
plain
to
us
that
Barker
would
quickly
bring
pressure
to
bear
upon
the
foreman
fitter
to
either
supply
a
drawing
and
rough
specifications
of
the
new
gun
,
or
else
come
face
to
face
with
ruin
.
<EOS>
We
had
ascertained
that
,
though
an
honest
workman
,
Rosser
only
lived
upon
his
weekly
wages
,
and
had
nothing
put
by
for
the
support
of
his
wife
and
four
children
.
<EOS>
The
patriotic
scruples
of
a
man
are
not
difficult
to
overcome
when
he
sees
his
wife
and
family
in
danger
of
starvation
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
next
evening
we
followed
Rosser
from
his
work
up
to
Dilston
Road
and
called
at
his
clean
and
humble
home
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
he
greatly
resented
our
intrusion
,
and
was
most
indignant
at
our
suggestion
that
he
was
about
to
be
made
a
cat's
-
paw
by
the
Kaiser
's
spies
.
 
<EOS>
But
on
production
of
the
letter
,
which
we
deciphered
,
the
plan
of
the
Ridges
Waterworks
,
and
our
allegations
concerning
his
generous
friend
,
he
began
to
reflect
.
 
<EOS>
"
Has
he
ever
asked
you
about
the
new
gun
now
being
made
at
Elswick
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well"--he
<EOS>
hesitated--"now
<EOS>
I
recall
the
fact
,
he
has
on
several
occasions
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
intended
to
either
ruin
you
,
Rosser
,
or
compel
you
to
become
a
traitor
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
'd
never
do
that
!
<EOS>
"
declared
the
stout
-
hearted
Briton
.
"
<EOS>
By
God
!
<EOS>
If
what
you
tell
me
is
true
,
"
he
cried
fiercely
,
"
I
'll
wring
the
blackguard
's
neck
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
I
said
,
"
do
n't
do
that
.
<EOS>
He
's
paid
the
purchase
money
for
a
new
house
for
you
,
has
n't
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
leave
him
to
us
.
<EOS>
We
'll
compel
him
to
hand
back
the
mortgage
,
and
your
revenge
shall
be
a
new
house
at
the
expense
of
the
German
Government
,
"
whereat
both
Ray
and
he
laughed
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
Next
night
we
faced
the
spy
at
his
own
rooms
,
and
on
pain
of
exposure
and
the
police
compelled
him
to
hand
over
the
new
little
villa
to
his
intended
victim
unconditionally
,
a
fact
which
caused
him
the
most
intense
chagrin
,
and
induced
him
to
utter
the
most
fearful
threats
of
vengeance
against
us
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
had
already
had
many
such
threats
.
<EOS>
So
we
only
laughed
at
them
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
,
however
,
the
satisfaction
of
exposing
the
spy
to
the
firm
which
employed
him
,
and
we
were
present
on
the
platform
of
the
Central
Station
when
,
two
days
later
,
having
given
up
his
rooms
and
packed
his
belongings
,
he
left
the
Tyne
-
side
for
London
,
evidently
to
consult
his
travelling
-
inspector
,
"
Henry
Lewis
.
"
 
<EOS>
Several
months
passed
.
<EOS>
The
attempt
to
obtain
details
of
our
new
gun
had
passed
completely
from
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
An
inquiry
which
Ray
and
I
had
been
actively
prosecuting
into
an
attempt
to
learn
the
secrets
of
the
"
transmitting
-
room
"
of
our
new
_
Dreadnoughts
_
had
led
me
to
the
south
of
Germany
.
<EOS>
I
had
had
a
rather
exciting
experience
in
Dresden
and
was
now
on
my
way
back
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Your
London
is
such
a
strange
place
.
<EOS>
So
dull
,
so
_
triste_--so
very
damp
and
foggy
,
"
remarked
the
girl
seated
in
the
train
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
always
,
mademoiselle
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
there
in
winter
.
<EOS>
You
should
go
in
June
.
<EOS>
In
the
season
it
is
as
pleasant
as
anywhere
else
in
the
world
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
desire
to
return
.
<EOS>
And
yet----
"
 
"
Well
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
yet
I
have
decided
to
go
straight
on
from
the
Gare
du
Nord
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
midday
service
!
<EOS>
I
shall
cross
by
that
also
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
fellow
-
travellers
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
together
in
the
night
<EOS>
_
rapide
_
from
Berlin
to
Paris
,
and
had
just
left
the
great
echoing
station
of
Cologne
,
with
few
stops
between
there
and
Paris
.
<EOS>
Day
was
breaking
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
met
Julie
Granier
under
curious
circumstances
only
a
few
hours
before
.
 
<EOS>
At
Berlin
,
being
known
to
the
controller
of
the
Wagon
-
lit
Company
,
I
was
at
once
given
a
two
-
berth
compartment
in
the
long
,
dusty
sleeping
-
car
,
those
big
carriages
in
which
I
so
often
spent
days
,
and
nights
too
,
for
the
matter
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
"
M'sieur
is
for
Paris
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
brown
-
uniformed
conductor
as
I
entered
,
and
after
flinging
in
my
traps
,
I
descended
,
went
to
the
buffet
and
had
a
mazagran
and
cigarette
until
our
departure
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
not
sat
there
more
than
five
minutes
when
the
conductor
,
a
man
with
whom
I
had
travelled
a
dozen
times
,
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
,
and
,
seeing
me
,
withdrew
.
<EOS>
Then
,
a
few
moments
later
,
he
entered
with
a
tall
,
dark
-
haired
,
good
-
looking
girl
,
who
stood
aside
as
he
approached
me
,
cap
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
m'sieur
,
but
a
lady
wishes
to
ask
a
great
favour
of
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
me
?
<EOS>
What
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
rising
.
 
<EOS>
Glancing
at
the
tall
figure
in
black
,
I
saw
that
she
was
not
more
than
twenty
-
two
at
the
outside
,
and
that
she
had
the
bearing
and
manner
of
a
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
m'sieur
,
she
will
explain
herself
,
"
the
man
said
,
whereupon
the
fair
stranger
approached
bowing
,
and
exclaimed
:
 
"
I
trust
m'sieur
will
pardon
me
for
what
I
am
about
to
ask
,
"
she
said
in
French
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
is
great
presumption
on
my
part
,
a
total
stranger
,
but
the
fact
is
that
I
am
bound
to
get
to
Paris
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
It
is
imperative
--
most
imperative
--
that
I
should
be
there
and
keep
an
appointment
.
<EOS>
I
find
,
however
,
that
all
the
berths
are
taken
,
and
that
the
only
vacant
one
is
in
your
compartment
.
<EOS>
I
thought----
"
<EOS>
and
she
hesitated
,
with
downcast
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
mean
that
you
want
me
to
allow
you
to
travel
here
,
mademoiselle
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
m'sieur
!
<EOS>
If
you
would
;
if
you
only
would
!
<EOS>
It
would
be
an
act
of
friendship
that
I
would
never
forget
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
saw
my
hesitation
,
and
I
detected
how
anxious
she
became
.
<EOS>
Her
gloved
hands
were
trembling
,
and
she
seemed
agitated
and
pale
to
the
lips
.
 
<EOS>
Again
I
scrutinised
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
of
the
spy
or
adventuress
about
her
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
she
seemed
a
very
charmingly
modest
young
woman
,
for
in
continuation
of
her
request
she
suggested
that
she
could
sit
in
the
conductor
's
seat
in
the
corridor
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
surely
that
would
be
rather
wearisome
,
mademoiselle
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
must
get
to
Paris
at
all
costs
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
m'sieur
!
<EOS>
You
will
allow
me
to
do
as
I
ask
,
will
you
not
?
<EOS>
Do
.
<EOS>
I
implore
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
made
no
reply
,
for
truth
to
tell
,
although
I
was
not
suspicious
,
I
hesitated
to
allow
the
fair
stranger
to
be
my
travelling
companion
.
<EOS>
It
was
against
my
principle
.
<EOS>
Yet
reading
disinclination
in
my
silence
,
she
continued
:
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
m'sieur
!
<EOS>
If
you
only
knew
in
what
deadly
peril
I
am
!
<EOS>
By
granting
this
favour
to
me
you
can"--and
<EOS>
she
broke
off
short
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
I
may
as
well
tell
you
the
truth
,
m'sieur
,
"
and
in
her
eyes
there
was
a
strange
look
that
I
had
never
seen
in
those
of
any
woman
before
,
"
you
can
save
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
life
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
echoed
,
but
at
that
moment
the
sleeping
-
car
conductor
,
standing
at
the
buffet
-
door
,
called
:
 
"
_
<EOS>
En
voiture
_
,
m'sieur
.
<EOS>
The
train
is
just
starting
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
take
me
,
"
implored
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
Do
,
m'sieur
.
<EOS>
Do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
time
for
further
discussion
,
therefore
I
did
as
she
requested
,
and
a
few
moments
later
,
with
a
dressing
-
case
,
which
was
all
the
baggage
she
had
,
she
mounted
into
the
_
wagon
-
lit
_
,
and
we
moved
off
to
the
French
capital
.
 
<EOS>
I
offered
her
the
sleeping
-
compartment
to
herself
,
but
she
steadily
refused
to
accept
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
m'sieur
,
certainly
not
,
"
was
her
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
sit
in
the
corridor
all
night
,
as
I
have
already
said
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
hour
after
hour
,
while
all
the
passengers
had
retired
to
rest
,
we
sat
at
the
end
of
the
car
and
chatted
.
<EOS>
I
asked
her
if
she
liked
a
cigarette
,
and
she
gladly
accepted
.
<EOS>
So
we
smoked
together
,
while
she
told
me
something
of
herself
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
native
of
Orleans
,
where
her
people
had
been
wealthy
landowners
,
she
said
,
but
some
unfortunate
speculation
on
her
father
's
part
brought
ruin
to
them
,
and
she
was
now
governess
in
the
family
of
a
certain
Baron
de
Moret
,
of
the
Chateau
de
Moret
,
near
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
A
governess
!
<EOS>
I
had
believed
from
her
dress
and
manner
that
she
was
at
least
the
daughter
of
some
French
aristocrat
,
and
I
confess
I
was
disappointed
to
find
that
she
was
only
a
superior
servant
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
come
from
Breslau
,
"
she
explained
.
<EOS>
"
On
very
urgent
business
--
business
that
concerns
my
own
self
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
not
in
Paris
this
morning
I
shall
,
in
all
probability
,
pay
the
penalty
with
my
life
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
?
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
In
the
grey
dawn
as
the
express
roared
on
towards
Paris
I
saw
that
her
countenance
was
that
of
a
woman
who
held
a
secret
.
<EOS>
At
first
I
had
been
conscious
that
there
was
something
unusual
about
her
,
and
suspected
her
to
be
an
adventuress
,
but
now
,
on
further
acquaintance
,
I
became
convinced
that
she
held
possession
of
some
knowledge
that
she
was
yearning
to
betray
,
yet
feared
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
One
fact
that
struck
me
as
curious
was
that
,
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
,
she
showed
that
she
knew
my
destination
was
London
.
<EOS>
At
first
this
puzzled
me
,
but
on
reflection
I
saw
that
the
conductor
,
knowing
me
,
had
told
her
.
 
<EOS>
At
Erquelinnes
we
had
descended
and
had
our
early
_
cafe
complet
_
,
and
now
as
we
rushed
onward
to
the
capital
she
had
suddenly
made
up
her
mind
to
go
through
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
we
arrive
in
Paris
I
must
leave
you
to
keep
my
appointments
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
meet
again
at
the
Gare
du
Nord
--
at
the
Calais
train
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Most
certainly
,
"
was
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
sighed
,
looking
straight
into
my
face
with
those
dark
eyes
that
were
so
luminous
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
--
you
can
never
guess
what
a
great
service
you
have
rendered
me
by
allowing
me
to
travel
here
with
you
.
<EOS>
My
peril
is
the
gravest
that
--
well
,
that
ever
threatened
a
woman
--
yet
now
,
by
your
aid
,
I
shall
be
able
to
save
myself
.
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
to
-
morrow
my
body
would
have
been
exposed
in
the
Morgue
--
the
corpse
of
a
woman
unknown
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
These
words
of
yours
interest
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
m'sieur
!
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
And
I
can
not
tell
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
secret
--
ah
!
<EOS>
if
I
only
dare
speak
<EOS>
you
would
help
me
,
I
know
,
"
and
I
saw
in
her
face
a
look
full
of
apprehension
and
distress
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
raised
her
hand
to
push
the
dark
hair
from
her
brow
,
as
though
it
oppressed
her
,
my
eyes
caught
sight
of
something
glistening
upon
her
wrist
,
half
concealed
by
the
lace
on
her
sleeve
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
magnificent
diamond
bangle
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
such
an
ornament
would
not
be
worn
by
a
mere
governess
!
<EOS>
I
looked
again
into
her
handsome
face
,
and
wondered
if
she
were
deceiving
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
it
be
in
my
power
to
assist
you
,
mademoiselle
,
I
will
do
so
with
the
greatest
pleasure
.
<EOS>
But
,
of
course
,
I
can
not
without
knowing
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
regret
that
my
lips
are
closed
concerning
them
,
"
she
sighed
,
looking
straight
before
her
despairingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
fear
to
go
alone
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
my
enemies
no
longer
,
"
was
her
reply
as
she
glanced
at
the
little
gold
watch
in
her
belt
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
in
Paris
before
noon
--
thanks
to
you
,
m'sieur
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
when
you
first
made
the
request
I
had
no
idea
of
the
urgency
of
your
journey
,
"
I
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
'm
glad
,
very
glad
,
that
I
've
had
an
opportunity
of
rendering
you
some
slight
service
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Slight
,
m'sieur
?
<EOS>
Why
,
you
have
saved
me
!
<EOS>
I
owe
you
a
debt
which
I
can
never
repay
--
never
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
laces
at
her
throat
rose
and
fell
as
she
sighed
<EOS>
,
her
wonderful
eyes
still
fixed
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
Gradually
the
wintry
sun
rose
over
the
bare
,
frozen
wine
-
lands
over
which
we
were
speeding
,
when
with
a
sudden
application
of
the
brakes
we
pulled
up
at
a
little
station
for
a
change
of
engine
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
after
three
minutes
,
we
were
off
again
,
until
at
nine
o'clock
we
ran
slowly
into
the
huge
terminus
in
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
tidied
her
hair
,
washed
,
brushed
her
dress
,
and
,
as
I
assisted
her
to
alight
<EOS>
,
she
bore
no
trace
of
her
long
journey
across
Germany
and
France
.
<EOS>
Strange
how
well
French
women
travel
!
<EOS>
English
women
are
always
tousled
and
tumbled
after
a
night
journey
,
but
a
French
or
Italian
woman
never
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
Au
revoir
_
,
m'sieur
,
till
twelve
at
the
Gare
du
Nord
,
"
she
exclaimed
,
with
a
merry
smile
and
a
bow
as
she
drove
away
in
a
cab
,
leaving
me
upon
the
kerb
gazing
after
her
and
wondering
.
 
<EOS>
Was
she
really
a
governess
,
as
she
pretended
?
 
<EOS>
Her
clothes
,
her
manner
,
her
smart
chatter
,
her
exquisite
_
chic
_
,
all
revealed
good
breeding
and
a
high
station
in
life
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
touch
of
cheap
shabbiness
--
or
at
least
I
could
not
detect
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
moments
before
twelve
she
alighted
at
the
Gare
du
Nord
and
greeted
me
merrily
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
slightly
flushed
,
and
I
thought
her
hand
trembled
as
I
took
it
.
<EOS>
But
together
we
walked
to
the
train
,
wherein
I
had
already
secured
seats
and
places
in
the
_
wagon
-
restaurant
_
.
 
<EOS>
The
railway
officials
,
the
controller
of
the
train
,
the
chief
of
the
restaurant
,
and
other
officials
,
recognising
me
,
saluted
,
whereupon
she
said
:
 
"
You
seem
very
well
known
in
Paris
,
m'sieur
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
constant
traveller
,
"
I
replied
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
A
little
too
constant
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
One
gets
wearied
with
such
continual
travel
as
I
am
forced
to
undertake
.
<EOS>
I
never
know
to
-
morrow
where
I
may
be
,
and
I
move
swiftly
from
one
capital
to
another
,
never
spending
more
than
a
day
or
two
in
the
same
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
it
must
be
very
pleasant
to
travel
so
much
,
"
she
declared
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
love
to
be
able
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
'm
passionately
fond
of
constant
change
.
"
 
<EOS>
Together
we
travelled
to
Calais
,
crossed
to
Dover
,
and
that
same
evening
alighted
at
Victoria
.
 
<EOS>
On
our
journey
to
London
she
gave
me
an
address
in
the
Vauxhall
Bridge
Road
,
where
,
she
said
,
a
letter
would
find
her
.
<EOS>
She
refused
to
tell
me
her
destination
,
or
to
allow
me
to
see
her
into
a
hansom
.
<EOS>
This
latter
fact
caused
me
considerable
reflection
.
<EOS>
Why
had
she
so
suddenly
made
up
her
mind
to
come
to
London
,
and
why
should
I
not
know
whither
she
went
when
she
had
told
me
so
many
details
concerning
herself
?
 
<EOS>
Of
one
fact
I
felt
quite
convinced
,
namely
,
that
she
had
lied
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
a
governess
,
as
she
pretended
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
had
been
seized
by
suspicion
that
a
tall
,
thin
-
faced
,
elderly
man
,
rather
shabbily
dressed
,
whom
I
had
noticed
on
the
platform
in
Paris
,
had
followed
us
.
<EOS>
He
had
travelled
second
-
class
,
and
,
on
alighting
at
Victoria
,
had
quickly
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
until
he
lingered
quite
close
to
us
as
I
wished
her
farewell
.
 
<EOS>
His
reappearance
there
recalled
to
me
that
he
had
watched
us
as
we
had
walked
up
and
down
the
platform
of
the
Gare
du
Nord
,
and
had
appeared
intensely
interested
in
all
our
movements
.
<EOS>
Whether
my
pretty
travelling
companion
noticed
him
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
I
,
however
,
followed
her
as
she
walked
out
of
the
station
carrying
her
dressing
-
bag
,
and
saw
the
tall
man
striding
after
her
.
<EOS>
Adventurer
was
written
upon
the
fellow
's
face
.
<EOS>
His
grey
moustache
was
upturned
,
and
his
keen
grey
eyes
looked
out
from
beneath
shaggy
brows
,
while
his
dark
,
thread
-
bare
overcoat
was
tightly
buttoned
across
his
chest
for
greater
warmth
.
 
<EOS>
Without
approaching
her
he
stood
back
in
the
shadow
and
saw
her
enter
a
hansom
in
the
station
-
yard
and
drive
out
into
Buckingham
Palace
Road
.
<EOS>
It
was
clear
that
she
was
not
going
to
the
address
she
had
given
me
,
for
she
was
driving
in
the
opposite
direction
.
 
<EOS>
My
duty
was
to
drive
direct
to
Bruton
Street
to
see
Ray
and
report
what
I
had
discovered
,
but
so
interested
was
I
in
the
thin
-
faced
watcher
that
I
gave
over
my
wraps
to
a
porter
who
knew
me
,
exchanged
my
heavy
travelling
-
coat
for
a
lighter
one
I
happened
to
have
,
and
walked
out
to
keep
further
observation
upon
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
Had
not
mademoiselle
declared
herself
to
be
in
danger
of
her
life
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
was
it
not
possible
that
this
fellow
,
whoever
he
was
,
was
a
secret
assassin
?
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
like
the
aspect
of
the
affair
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
warned
her
against
him
,
and
I
now
became
filled
with
regret
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
complete
mystery
,
and
as
I
dogged
the
footsteps
of
the
unknown
foreigner
--
for
that
he
undoubtedly
was
--
<EOS>
I
became
more
deeply
interested
in
what
was
in
progress
.
 
<EOS>
He
walked
to
Trafalgar
Square
,
where
he
hesitated
in
such
a
manner
as
to
show
that
he
was
not
well
acquainted
with
London
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
which
of
the
converging
thoroughfares
to
take
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
inquired
of
the
constable
on
point
-
duty
,
and
then
went
up
St.
Martin
's
Lane
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
had
turned
I
approached
the
policeman
,
and
asked
what
the
stranger
wanted
,
explaining
that
he
was
a
suspicious
character
whom
I
was
following
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
E
's
a
Frenchman
,
sir
.
'
<EOS>
E
wants
Burton
Crescent
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
's
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
just
off
the
Euston
Road
--
close
to
Judd
Street
.
<EOS>
I
've
told
'
i
m
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
I
entered
a
hansom
and
drove
to
the
place
in
question
,
a
semicircle
of
dark
-
looking
,
old
-
fashioned
houses
of
the
Bloomsbury
type
--
most
of
them
let
out
in
apartments
.
<EOS>
Then
alighting
,
I
loitered
for
half
an
hour
up
and
down
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
at
last
,
his
tall
,
meagre
figure
looming
dark
in
the
lamp
-
light
.
<EOS>
Very
eagerly
he
walked
round
the
Crescent
,
examining
the
numbers
of
the
houses
,
until
he
came
to
one
rather
cleaner
than
the
others
,
of
which
he
took
careful
observation
.
 
<EOS>
I
,
too
,
took
note
of
the
number
.
 
<EOS>
Afterwards
the
stranger
turned
into
the
Euston
Road
,
crossed
to
King
's
Cross
Station
,
where
he
sent
a
telegram
,
and
then
went
to
one
of
the
small
uninviting
private
hotels
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
Having
seen
him
there
,
I
returned
to
Burton
Crescent
,
and
for
an
hour
watched
the
house
,
wondering
whether
Julie
Granier
had
taken
up
her
abode
there
.
<EOS>
To
me
it
seemed
as
though
the
stranger
had
overheard
the
directions
she
had
given
the
cabman
.
 
<EOS>
The
windows
of
the
house
were
closed
by
green
Venetian
blinds
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
that
there
were
lights
in
most
of
the
rooms
,
while
over
the
fanlight
of
the
front
door
was
a
small
transparent
square
of
glass
.
<EOS>
The
front
steps
were
well
kept
,
and
in
the
deep
basement
was
a
well
-
lighted
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
been
there
about
half
an
hour
when
the
door
opened
,
and
a
middle
-
aged
man
in
evening
dress
,
and
wearing
a
black
overcoat
and
crush
hat
,
emerged
.
<EOS>
His
dark
face
was
an
aristocratic
one
,
and
as
he
descended
the
steps
he
drew
on
his
white
gloves
,
for
he
was
evidently
on
his
way
to
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
I
took
good
notice
of
his
face
,
for
it
was
a
striking
countenance
,
one
which
once
seen
could
never
be
forgotten
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
-
servant
behind
him
blew
a
cab
-
whistle
,
a
hansom
drew
up
,
and
he
drove
away
.
<EOS>
Then
I
walked
up
and
down
in
the
vicinity
,
keeping
a
weary
vigil
,
for
my
curiosity
was
now
much
excited
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
meant
mischief
.
<EOS>
Of
that
I
was
certain
.
 
<EOS>
The
one
point
I
wished
to
clear
up
was
whether
Julie
Granier
was
actually
within
that
house
.
<EOS>
But
though
I
watched
until
I
became
half
frozen
in
the
drizzling
rain
,
all
was
in
vain
.
<EOS>
So
I
took
a
cab
and
drove
to
Bruton
Street
.
 
<EOS>
That
same
night
,
when
I
got
to
my
rooms
,
I
wrote
a
line
to
the
address
that
Julie
had
given
me
,
asking
whether
she
would
make
an
appointment
to
meet
me
,
as
I
wished
to
give
her
some
very
important
information
concerning
herself
,
and
to
this
,
on
the
following
day
,
I
received
a
reply
asking
me
to
call
at
the
house
in
Burton
Crescent
that
evening
at
nine
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
Naturally
I
went
.
<EOS>
My
surmise
was
correct
that
the
house
watched
by
the
stranger
was
her
abode
.
<EOS>
The
fellow
was
keeping
observation
upon
it
with
some
evil
intent
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
-
servant
,
on
admitting
me
,
showed
me
into
a
well
-
furnished
drawing
-
room
on
the
first
floor
,
where
sat
my
pretty
travelling
companion
ready
to
receive
me
.
 
<EOS>
In
French
she
greeted
me
very
warmly
,
bade
me
be
seated
,
and
after
some
preliminaries
inquired
the
nature
of
the
information
which
I
wished
to
impart
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Very
briefly
I
told
her
of
the
shabby
watcher
<EOS>
,
whereupon
she
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
cry
of
mingled
terror
and
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Describe
him
--
quickly
!
"
<EOS>
she
urged
in
breathless
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
so
,
and
she
sat
back
again
in
her
chair
,
staring
straight
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
she
gasped
,
her
countenance
pale
as
death
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
they
mean
revenge
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
Very
well
!
<EOS>
Now
that
I
am
forewarned
I
shall
know
how
to
act
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
rose
,
and
pacing
the
room
in
agitation
pushed
back
the
dark
hair
from
her
brow
.
<EOS>
Then
her
hands
clenched
themselves
,
and
her
teeth
were
set
,
for
she
was
desperate
.
 
<EOS>
The
shabby
man
was
an
emissary
of
her
enemies
.
<EOS>
She
told
me
as
much
.
<EOS>
Yet
in
all
she
said
was
mystery
.
<EOS>
At
one
moment
I
was
convinced
that
she
had
told
the
truth
when
she
said
she
was
a
governess
,
and
at
the
next
I
suspected
her
of
trying
to
deceive
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
,
after
she
had
handed
me
a
cigarette
,
the
servant
tapped
the
door
,
and
a
well
-
dressed
man
entered
--
<EOS>
the
same
man
I
had
seen
leave
the
house
two
nights
previously
.
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
introduce
you
?
"
<EOS>
mademoiselle
asked
.
<EOS>
"
M'sieur
Jacox
--
M'sieur
le
Baron
de
Moret
.
"
 
"
Charmed
to
make
your
acquaintance
,
sir
,
"
the
Baron
said
,
grasping
my
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
here
has
already
spoken
of
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
satisfaction
is
mutual
,
I
assure
you
,
Baron
,
"
was
my
reply
,
and
then
we
reseated
ourselves
and
began
to
chat
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
mademoiselle
made
some
remark
in
a
language
--
<EOS>
some
Slav
language
--
which
I
did
not
understand
.
<EOS>
The
effect
it
had
upon
the
newcomer
was
almost
electrical
.
<EOS>
He
started
from
his
seat
,
glaring
at
her
.
<EOS>
Then
he
began
to
question
her
rapidly
in
the
unknown
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
flashily
dressed
man
of
overbearing
manner
,
with
a
thick
neck
and
square
,
determined
chin
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
evident
that
the
warning
I
had
given
them
aroused
their
apprehension
,
for
they
held
a
rapid
consultation
,
and
then
Julie
went
out
,
returning
with
another
man
,
a
dark
-
haired
,
low
-
bred
looking
foreigner
,
who
spoke
the
same
tongue
as
his
companions
.
 
<EOS>
They
disregarded
my
presence
altogether
in
their
eager
consultation
;
therefore
I
rose
to
go
,
for
I
saw
that
I
was
not
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
Julie
held
my
hand
and
looked
into
my
eyes
in
mute
appeal
.
<EOS>
She
appeared
anxious
to
say
something
to
me
in
private
.
<EOS>
At
least
that
was
my
impression
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
left
the
house
I
passed
,
at
the
end
of
the
Crescent
,
a
shabby
man
idly
smoking
.
<EOS>
Was
he
one
of
the
watchers
?
 
<EOS>
Four
days
went
by
.
 
<EOS>
One
evening
I
was
passing
through
the
red
-
carpeted
hall
of
the
Savoy
Hotel
when
a
neatly
dressed
figure
in
black
rose
and
greeted
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
Julie
,
who
seemed
to
have
been
awaiting
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
speak
to
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
breathlessly
,
when
we
had
exchanged
greetings
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
apologise
for
the
manner
in
which
I
treated
you
the
other
evening
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
assured
her
that
no
apologies
were
needed
,
and
together
we
seated
ourselves
in
a
corner
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
really
ought
not
to
trouble
you
with
my
affairs
,
"
she
said
presently
,
in
an
apologetic
tone
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
remember
what
I
told
you
when
you
so
kindly
allowed
me
to
travel
by
the
_
wagon
-
lit_--I
mean
of
my
peril
?
"
 
"
Certainly
.
<EOS>
But
I
thought
it
was
all
over
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
foolishly
believed
that
it
was
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
watched
--
I
--
I'm
a
marked
woman
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
after
some
hesitation
,
she
added
,
"
I
wonder
if
you
would
do
me
another
favour
.
<EOS>
You
could
save
my
life
,
M'sieur
Jacox
,
if
you
only
would
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
I
can
render
you
such
a
service
,
mademoiselle
,
I
shall
be
only
too
delighted
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
present
my
plans
are
immature
,
"
she
answered
after
a
pause
.
"
<EOS>
But
why
not
dine
with
me
to
-
morrow
night
?
<EOS>
We
have
some
friends
,
but
we
shall
be
able
to
escape
them
and
discuss
the
matter
alone
.
<EOS>
Do
come
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
accepted
,
and
<EOS>
she
,
taking
a
taxi
in
the
Strand
,
drove
off
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
following
night
at
eight
I
entered
the
comfortable
drawing
-
room
in
Burton
Crescent
,
where
three
well
-
dressed
men
and
three
rather
smart
ladies
were
assembled
,
including
my
hostess
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
foreigners
,
and
among
them
was
the
Baron
,
who
appeared
to
be
the
most
honoured
guest
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
quite
plain
that
,
instead
of
being
a
governess
as
she
had
asserted
,
my
friend
was
a
lady
of
good
family
,
and
the
Baron
's
social
equal
.
 
<EOS>
The
party
was
a
very
pleasant
one
,
and
there
was
considerable
merriment
at
table
.
<EOS>
My
hostess
's
apprehension
of
the
previous
day
had
all
disappeared
,
while
the
Baron
's
demeanour
was
one
of
calm
security
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
at
her
left
hand
,
and
she
was
particularly
gracious
to
me
,
the
whole
conversation
at
table
being
in
French
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
after
dessert
,
the
Baron
remarked
that
,
as
it
was
his
birthday
,
we
should
have
snap
-
dragon
,
and
,
with
his
hostess
's
permission
,
left
the
dining
-
room
and
prepared
it
.
<EOS>
Presently
it
appeared
in
a
big
antique
Worcester
bowl
,
and
was
placed
on
the
table
close
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
electric
light
was
switched
off
and
the
spirit
ignited
.
 
<EOS>
Next
moment
with
shouts
of
laughter
,
the
blue
flames
shedding
a
weird
light
upon
our
faces
,
we
were
pulling
the
plums
out
of
the
fire
--
a
childish
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
placed
one
in
my
mouth
,
and
swallowed
it
,
but
as
I
was
taking
a
second
from
the
blue
flames
,
I
suddenly
felt
a
faintness
.
<EOS>
At
first
I
put
it
down
to
the
heat
of
the
room
,
but
a
moment
later
I
felt
a
sharp
spasm
through
my
heart
,
and
my
brain
swelled
too
large
for
my
skull
.
<EOS>
My
jaws
were
set
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
speak
,
but
was
unable
to
articulate
a
word
!
 
<EOS>
I
saw
the
fun
had
stopped
,
and
the
faces
of
all
were
turned
upon
me
anxiously
.
<EOS>
The
Baron
had
risen
,
and
his
dark
countenance
peered
into
mine
with
a
fiendish
murderous
expression
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
ill
!
<EOS>
"
I
gasped
.
<EOS>
"
I
--
I'm
sure
I
'm
poisoned
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
faces
of
all
smiled
again
,
while
the
Baron
uttered
some
words
which
I
could
not
understand
,
and
then
there
was
a
dead
silence
,
all
still
watching
me
intently
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
fiends
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
,
with
a
great
effort
,
as
I
struggled
to
rise
.
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
done
to
you
that
you
should--_poison
--
me
_
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
the
Baron
grinned
in
my
face
,
and
that
I
fell
forward
heavily
upon
the
table
,
my
heart
gripped
in
the
spasm
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
Of
what
occurred
afterwards
<EOS>
I
have
no
recollection
,
for
,
when
I
slowly
regained
knowledge
of
things
around
me
<EOS>
,
I
found
myself
,
cramped
and
cold
,
lying
beneath
a
bare
,
leafless
hedge
in
a
grass
field
.
<EOS>
I
managed
to
struggle
to
my
feet
and
discovered
myself
in
a
bare
,
flat
,
open
country
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
could
judge
it
was
midday
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
to
a
gate
,
skirted
a
hedge
,
and
gained
the
main
road
.
<EOS>
With
difficulty
I
walked
to
the
nearest
town
,
a
distance
of
about
four
miles
,
without
meeting
a
soul
,
and
to
my
surprise
found
myself
in
Hitchin
.
<EOS>
The
spectacle
of
a
man
entering
the
town
in
evening
dress
and
hatless
in
broad
daylight
was
,
no
doubt
,
curious
,
but
I
was
anxious
to
return
to
London
and
give
information
against
those
who
had
,
without
any
apparent
motive
,
laid
an
ingenious
plot
to
poison
me
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
old
Sun
Inn
,
which
motorists
from
London
know
<EOS>
so
well
,
I
learned
that
the
time
was
eleven
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
The
only
manner
in
which
I
could
account
for
my
presence
in
Hitchin
was
that
,
believed
to
be
dead
by
the
Baron
and
his
accomplices
<EOS>
,
I
had
been
conveyed
in
a
motor
-
car
to
the
spot
where
I
was
found
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
shillings
remained
in
my
pocket
,
and
,
strangely
enough
,
beside
me
when
I
recovered
consciousness
<EOS>
I
had
found
a
small
fluted
phial
marked
"
Prussic
acid
--
poison
.
<EOS>
"
The
assassins
had
attempted
to
make
it
apparent
that
I
had
committed
suicide
!
 
<EOS>
Two
hours
later
,
after
a
rest
and
a
wash
,
I
borrowed
an
overcoat
and
golf
-
cap
and
took
the
train
to
King
's
Cross
.
 
<EOS>
At
Judd
Street
Police
Station
I
made
a
statement
,
and
with
two
plain
-
clothes
officers
returned
to
the
house
in
Burton
Crescent
,
only
to
find
that
the
fair
Julie
and
her
friends
had
flown
.
 
<EOS>
On
forcing
the
door
,
we
found
the
dining
-
table
just
as
it
had
been
left
after
the
poisoned
snap
-
dragon
of
the
previous
night
.
<EOS>
Nothing
had
been
touched
.
<EOS>
Only
Julie
,
the
Baron
,
the
man
-
servant
,
and
the
guests
had
all
gone
,
and
the
place
was
deserted
.
 
<EOS>
The
police
were
utterly
puzzled
at
the
entire
absence
of
motive
.
 
<EOS>
On
my
return
to
Guilford
Street
I
at
once
telephoned
to
Ray
,
and
he
was
quickly
with
me
,
Vera
accompanying
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
related
the
whole
of
the
circumstances
,
while
my
friends
sat
listening
very
attentively
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
Ray
said
at
last
,
"
it
's
a
great
pity
,
old
chap
,
you
did
n't
mention
this
before
.
<EOS>
The
Baron
de
Moret
is
no
other
person
than
Lucien
Carron
,
one
of
Hartmann
's
most
trusted
agents
,
while
Julie
's
real
name
is
Erna
Hertfeldt
,
a
very
clever
female
spy
,
who
has
,
of
late
,
been
engaged
in
endeavouring
to
obtain
certain
facts
regarding
the
defences
of
the
Humber
estuary
.
<EOS>
She
was
recalled
to
Berlin
recently
to
consult
Hirsch
,
chief
of
the
German
Intelligence
Department
.
<EOS>
You
evidently
came
across
her
on
her
way
back
,
while
the
old
man
whom
she
met
at
the
Gare
du
Nord
was
Josef
Gleichen
,
the
spy
whom
I
told
you
was
in
association
with
Barker
up
at
Newcastle
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
remember
,
"
I
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
he
had
evidently
seen
you
,
and
again
recognised
you
,
"
Ray
replied
.
<EOS>
"
It
seems
that
he
must
have
followed
you
to
London
,
where
,
having
told
Lucien
Carron
,
or
'
the
Baron
,
'
of
your
return
,
they
formed
a
plot
to
avenge
your
action
up
at
Elswick
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
was
entrapped
by
that
woman
Julie
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
,
my
head
still
feeling
sore
and
dizzy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Without
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
The
spies
have
made
yet
another
attempt
upon
your
life
,
Mr.
Jacox
,
"
Vera
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
why
did
they
take
me
out
in
a
motor
-
car
to
Hitchin
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
make
it
appear
like
a
case
of
suicide
,
"
Ray
said
.
<EOS>
"
Remember
that
both
of
us
,
old
chap
,
are
marked
men
by
Hartmann
and
his
unscrupulous
friends
.
<EOS>
But
what
does
it
matter
if
we
have
managed
to
preserve
the
secret
of
our
new
gun
?
<EOS>
We
'll
be
even
with
our
enemies
for
this
one
day
ere
long
,
mark
me
,
"
he
laughed
,
as
he
lit
a
fresh
cigarette
.

CHAPTER
X
 
<EOS>
THE
SECRET
OF
THE
CLYDE
DEFENCES
  
<EOS>
A
curious
episode
was
that
of
the
plans
of
the
Clyde
Defences
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
February
evening
.
<EOS>
Wet
,
tired
,
and
hungry
<EOS>
,
I
turned
the
long
grey
touring
car
into
the
yard
of
the
old
"
White
Hart
,
"
at
Salisbury
,
and
descended
with
eager
anticipation
of
a
big
fire
and
comfortable
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
My
mechanic
Bennett
and
<EOS>
I
had
been
on
the
road
since
soon
after
dawn
,
and
we
yet
had
many
miles
to
cover
.
<EOS>
Two
months
ago
I
had
mounted
the
car
at
the
garage
in
Wardour
Street
and
set
out
upon
a
long
and
weary
ten
-
thousand
-
mile
journey
in
England
,
not
for
pleasure
,
as
you
may
well
imagine
--
but
purely
upon
business
.
<EOS>
My
business
,
to
be
exact
,
was
reconnoitring
,
from
a
military
stand
-
point
,
all
the
roads
and
by
-
roads
lying
between
the
Tyne
and
the
Thames
as
well
as
certain
districts
south
-
west
of
London
,
in
order
to
write
the
book
upon
similar
lines
to
_
The
Invasion
of
1910
<EOS>
_
.
 
<EOS>
For
two
months
we
had
lived
upon
the
road
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
Ray
and
Vera
had
travelled
with
me
.
<EOS>
When
Bennett
and
I
had
started
it
was
late
and
pleasant
autumn
.
<EOS>
Now
it
was
bleak
,
black
winter
,
and
hardly
the
kind
of
weather
to
travel
twelve
or
fourteen
hours
daily
in
an
open
car
.
<EOS>
Day
after
day
,
week
after
week
,
the
big
"
sixty
"
had
roared
along
,
ploughing
the
mud
of
those
ever
-
winding
roads
of
England
until
we
had
lost
all
count
of
the
days
of
the
week
;
my
voluminous
note
-
books
were
gradually
being
filled
with
valuable
data
,
and
the
nerves
of
both
of
us
were
becoming
so
strained
that
we
were
victims
of
insomnia
.
<EOS>
Hence
at
night
,
when
we
could
not
sleep
,
we
travelled
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
great
portfolio
in
the
back
of
the
car
I
carried
the
six
-
inch
ordnance
map
of
the
whole
of
the
east
of
England
divided
into
many
sections
,
and
upon
these
I
was
carefully
marking
out
,
as
result
of
my
survey
,
the
weak
points
of
our
land
in
case
an
enemy
invaded
our
shores
from
the
North
Sea
.
<EOS>
All
telegraphs
,
telephones
,
and
cables
from
London
to
Germany
and
Holland
I
was
especially
noting
,
for
would
not
the
enemy
's
emissaries
,
before
they
attempted
to
land
,
seize
all
means
of
communication
with
the
metropolis
?
<EOS>
Besides
this
I
took
note
of
places
where
food
could
be
obtained
,
lists
of
shops
,
and
collected
a
quantity
of
other
valuable
information
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
work
I
had
been
assisted
by
half
a
dozen
of
the
highest
officers
of
the
Intelligence
Department
of
the
War
Office
,
as
well
as
other
well
-
known
experts
--
careful
,
methodical
work
prior
to
writing
my
forecast
of
what
must
happen
to
our
beloved
country
in
case
of
invasion
.
<EOS>
The
newspapers
had
referred
to
my
long
journey
of
inquiry
,
and
often
when
I
arrived
in
a
town
,
our
car
,
smothered
in
mud
,
yet
its
powerful
engines
running
like
a
clock
,
was
the
object
of
public
curiosity
,
while
Bennett
,
with
true
chauffeur
-
like
imperturbability
,
sat
immovable
,
utterly
regardless
of
the
interest
we
created
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
gentleman
-
driver
,
and
the
best
man
at
the
wheel
I
ever
had
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
were
in
a
hurry
he
would
travel
nearly
a
mile
a
minute
over
an
open
road
,
sounding
his
siren
driven
off
the
fly
-
wheel
,
and
scenting
police
-
traps
,
with
the
happy
result
that
we
were
never
held
up
for
exceeding
the
limit
.
<EOS>
We
used
to
take
it
in
turns
to
drive
--
three
hours
at
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
On
that
particular
night
,
when
we
entered
Salisbury
from
Wincanton
Road
,
having
come
up
from
Exeter
,
it
had
been
raining
unceasingly
all
day
,
and
we
presented
a
pretty
plight
in
our
yellow
fishermen
's
oilskins
--
which
we
had
bought
weeks
before
in
King
's
Lynn
as
the
only
means
of
keeping
dry
--
dripping
wet
and
smothered
to
our
very
eyes
in
mud
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
hasty
wash
I
entered
the
coffee
-
room
,
and
found
that
I
was
the
sole
diner
save
a
short
,
funny
,
little
old
lady
in
black
bonnet
and
cape
,
and
a
young
,
rather
pretty
,
well
-
dressed
girl
,
whom
I
took
to
be
her
daughter
,
seated
at
a
table
a
little
distance
away
.
 
<EOS>
Both
glanced
at
me
as
they
entered
,
and
I
saw
that
ere
<EOS>
I
was
half
through
my
meal
their
interest
in
me
had
suddenly
increased
.
<EOS>
Without
doubt
,
the
news
of
my
arrival
had
gone
round
the
hotel
,
and
the
waiter
had
informed
the
pair
of
my
identity
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
then
eight
o'clock
,
and
I
had
arranged
with
Bennett
that
after
a
rest
,
we
would
push
forward
at
half
-
past
ten
by
Marlborough
,
as
far
as
Swindon
,
on
our
way
to
Birmingham
.
 
<EOS>
The
waiter
had
brought
me
a
couple
of
telegrams
from
Ray
telling
me
good
news
of
another
inquiry
he
was
instituting
,
and
having
finished
my
meal
I
was
seated
alone
by
the
smoking
-
room
fire
enjoying
a
cigarette
and
liqueur
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
had
almost
fallen
asleep
when
the
waiter
returned
,
saying
:
 
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
sir
,
but
there
's
a
lady
outside
in
great
distress
.
<EOS>
She
wants
to
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
,
and
asks
if
she
may
come
in
.
"
<EOS>
He
presented
a
card
,
and
the
name
upon
it
was
"
Mrs.
Henry
Bingham
.
"
 
<EOS>
Rather
surprised
,
I
nevertheless
consented
to
see
her
,
and
in
a
few
moments
the
door
reopened
and
the
younger
of
the
two
ladies
I
had
seen
at
dinner
entered
.
 
<EOS>
She
bowed
to
me
as
I
rose
,
and
<EOS>
then
,
evidently
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
,
she
said
:
 
"
I
must
apologise
for
disturbing
you
,
only
<EOS>
--
only
I
thought
perhaps
you
would
be
generous
enough
,
when
you
have
heard
of
our
difficulty
,
to
grant
my
mother
and
I
a
favour
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
can
be
of
any
assistance
to
you
,
I
shall
be
most
delighted
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
I
answered
,
as
her
big
grey
eyes
met
mine
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
she
said
,
looking
me
straight
in
the
face
<EOS>
,
"
the
fact
is
that
our
car
has
broken
down
--
something
wrong
with
the
clutch
,
our
man
says
--
and
we
ca
n't
get
any
further
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
We
are
on
our
way
to
Swindon
--
to
my
husband
,
who
has
met
with
an
accident
and
is
in
the
hospital
,
but
--
but
,
unfortunately
,
there
is
no
train
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Your
chauffeur
has
told
our
man
that
you
are
just
leaving
for
Swindon
,
and
my
mother
and
I
have
been
wondering
--
<EOS>
well
--
whether
we
might
encroach
upon
your
good
nature
and
beg
seats
in
your
car
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
welcome
to
travel
with
me
,
of
course
,
"
<EOS>
I
replied
without
hesitation
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
fear
that
on
such
a
night
it
will
hardly
be
pleasant
to
travel
in
an
open
car
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
we
do
n't
mind
that
a
bit
,
"
she
assured
me
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
lots
of
waterproofs
and
things
.
<EOS>
It
is
really
most
kind
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
telegram
at
four
o'clock
this
afternoon
that
my
husband
had
been
taken
to
the
hospital
for
operation
,
and
naturally
I
am
most
anxious
to
be
at
his
side
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Naturally
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
regret
very
much
that
you
should
have
such
cause
for
distress
.
<EOS>
Let
us
start
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
ready
in
ten
minutes
.
"
 
<EOS>
While
she
went
back
to
her
mother
,
I
went
out
into
the
yard
where
the
head
-
lights
of
my
big
"
sixty
"
were
gleaming
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
two
lady
passengers
to
Swindon
,
Bennett
,
"
I
said
,
as
my
chauffeur
threw
away
his
cigarette
and
approached
me
.
<EOS>
"
What
kind
of
car
have
the
ladies
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
twenty
-
four
.
<EOS>
It
's
in
the
garage
up
yonder
.
<EOS>
The
clutch
wo
n't
hold
,
it
seems
.
<EOS>
But
their
man
's
a
foreigner
,
and
does
n't
speak
much
English
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
'd
better
pack
our
luggage
tighter
,
so
as
to
give
the
ladies
room
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
Do
so
.
<EOS>
And
let
's
get
on
the
road
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
sir
,
"
responded
the
man
as
he
entered
the
car
and
began
packing
our
suit
-
cases
together
while
almost
immediately
the
two
ladies
emerged
,
the
elder
one
,
whose
voice
was
harsh
and
squeaky
,
and
who
was
,
I
noticed
,
very
deformed
,
thanking
me
profusely
.
 
<EOS>
We
stowed
them
away
as
comfortably
as
possible
,
and
just
as
the
cathedral
chimes
rang
out
half
-
past
ten
,
the
ladies
gave
parting
injunctions
to
their
chauffeur
,
and
we
drew
out
of
the
yard
.
 
<EOS>
I
apologised
for
the
dampness
and
discomfort
of
an
open
car
,
and
briefly
explained
my
long
journey
and
its
object
.
<EOS>
But
both
ladies
--
the
name
of
the
queer
little
old
widow
I
understood
to
be
Sandford
--
only
laughed
,
and
reassured
me
that
they
were
all
right
.
 
<EOS>
That
night
I
drove
myself
.
<EOS>
With
the
exhaust
opened
and
roaring
,
and
the
siren
shrieking
,
we
sped
along
through
the
dark
,
rainy
night
up
by
old
Sarum
,
through
Netheravon
,
and
across
Overton
Heath
into
Marlborough
without
once
changing
speed
or
speaking
with
my
passengers
.
<EOS>
As
we
came
down
the
hill
from
Ogbourne
,
I
had
to
pull
up
suddenly
for
a
farmer
's
cart
,
and
turned
,
asking
the
pair
behind
how
they
were
faring
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
did
so
I
noticed
that
both
of
them
seemed
considerably
flurried
,
but
attributed
it
to
the
high
pace
we
had
been
travelling
when
I
had
so
suddenly
pulled
up
on
rounding
the
bend
.
 
<EOS>
Three
-
quarters
of
an
hour
later
I
deposited
them
at
their
destination
,
the
"
Goddard
Arms
,
"
in
Old
Swindon
,
and
,
descending
,
received
their
profuse
thanks
,
the
elder
lady
giving
me
her
card
with
an
address
in
Earl
's
Court
Road
,
Kensington
,
and
asking
me
to
call
upon
her
when
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
then
half
an
hour
past
midnight
,
but
Bennett
and
I
resolved
to
push
forward
as
far
as
Oxford
,
which
we
did
,
arriving
at
the
"
Mitre
"
about
half
-
past
one
,
utterly
fagged
and
worn
out
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
was
brighter
,
and
we
proceeded
north
to
Birmingham
and
across
once
again
to
the
east
coast
,
where
the
bulk
of
my
work
lay
.
 
<EOS>
About
a
fortnight
went
by
.
<EOS>
With
the
assistance
of
two
well
-
known
staff
-
officers
I
had
been
reconnoitring
the
country
around
Beccles
,
in
Suffolk
,
which
we
had
decided
upon
as
a
most
important
strategical
point
,
and
one
morning
I
found
myself
at
that
old
-
fashioned
hotel
"
The
Cups
,
"
at
Colchester
,
taking
a
day
's
rest
.
<EOS>
The
two
officers
had
returned
to
London
,
and
I
was
again
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Out
in
the
garage
I
found
a
rather
smart
,
good
-
looking
man
in
navy
serge
chatting
with
Bennett
and
admiring
my
car
.
<EOS>
My
chauffeur
,
with
pardonable
pride
,
had
been
telling
him
of
our
long
journey
,
and
as
I
approached
,
the
stranger
informed
me
of
his
own
enthusiasm
as
a
motorist
.
 
<EOS>
"
Curiously
enough
,
"
he
added
,
"
I
have
been
wishing
to
meet
you
,
in
order
to
thank
you
for
your
kindness
to
my
mother
and
sister
the
other
night
at
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
My
name
is
Sandford
--
Charles
Sandford
--
and
if
I
'm
not
mistaken
we
are
members
of
the
same
club
--
White
's
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
we
?
"
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
.
"
<EOS>
Then
I
'm
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
lounged
together
for
half
an
hour
,
smoking
and
chatting
,
until
presently
he
said
:
 
"
I
live
out
at
Edwardstone
,
about
ten
miles
from
here
.
<EOS>
Why
not
come
out
and
dine
with
me
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
My
place
is
n't
very
extensive
,
but
it
's
cosy
enough
for
a
bachelor
.
<EOS>
I
'd
feel
extremely
honoured
if
you
would
.
<EOS>
I
'm
all
alone
.
<EOS>
Do
come
.
"
 
<EOS>
Cosmopolitan
that
I
am
,
yet
I
am
not
prone
to
accept
the
invitations
of
strangers
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
this
man
was
not
altogether
a
stranger
,
for
was
he
not
a
member
of
my
own
club
?
<EOS>
Truth
to
tell
<EOS>
,
I
had
become
bored
by
the
deadly
dullness
of
country
hotels
,
therefore
I
was
glad
enough
to
accept
his
proffered
hospitality
and
spend
a
pleasant
evening
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
send
a
wire
to
my
housekeeper
,
and
I
'll
pilot
you
in
your
car
to
my
place
this
evening
.
<EOS>
We
'll
start
at
seven
,
and
dine
at
eight
--
if
that
will
suit
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
And
so
it
was
arranged
.
 
<EOS>
Bennett
had
the
whole
of
the
day
to
go
through
the
car
and
do
one
or
two
necessary
repairs
,
while
Sandford
and
myself
idled
about
the
town
.
<EOS>
My
companion
struck
me
as
an
exceedingly
pleasant
fellow
,
who
,
having
travelled
very
extensively
,
now
preferred
a
quiet
existence
in
the
country
,
with
a
little
hunting
and
a
little
shooting
in
due
season
,
to
the
dinners
,
theatres
,
and
fevered
haste
of
London
life
.
 
<EOS>
The
evening
proved
a
very
dark
one
with
threatening
rain
as
we
turned
out
of
the
yard
of
"
The
Cups
,
"
Sandford
and
I
seated
behind
.
<EOS>
My
friend
directed
Bennett
from
time
to
time
,
and
soon
we
found
ourselves
out
on
the
Sudbury
road
.
<EOS>
We
passed
through
a
little
place
which
I
knew
to
be
Heyland
,
and
then
turned
off
to
the
right
,
across
what
seemed
to
be
a
wide
stretch
of
bleak
,
open
country
.
 
<EOS>
Over
the
heath
we
went
,
<EOS>
our
head
-
lights
glaring
far
before
us
,
for
about
two
miles
when
my
friend
called
to
Bennett
:
 
<EOS>
"
Turn
to
the
left
at
the
cross
-
roads
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
a
few
moments
later
we
were
travelling
rather
cautiously
up
a
rough
by
-
road
,
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
which
we
came
to
a
long
,
old
-
fashioned
house
--
a
farm
-
house
evidently
,
transformed
into
a
residence
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
was
opened
by
a
middle
-
aged
,
red
-
faced
man
-
servant
,
and
as
I
stepped
within
the
small
hall
hung
with
foxes
'
masks
,
brushes
,
and
other
trophies
,
my
friend
wished
me
a
hearty
welcome
to
his
home
.
 
<EOS>
The
dining
-
room
proved
to
be
an
old
-
fashioned
apartment
panelled
from
floor
to
ceiling
.
<EOS>
The
table
,
set
for
two
,
bore
a
fine
old
silver
candelabra
,
a
quantity
of
antique
plate
,
and
,
adorned
with
flowers
,
was
evidently
the
table
of
a
man
who
was
comfortably
off
.
 
<EOS>
We
threw
off
our
heavy
coats
and
made
ourselves
cosy
beside
the
fire
when
the
servant
,
whom
my
host
addressed
as
Henry
,
brought
in
the
soup
.
<EOS>
Therefore
we
went
to
the
table
and
commenced
.
 
<EOS>
The
meal
proved
a
well
-
cooked
and
well
-
chosen
one
,
and
I
congratulated
him
upon
his
cook
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
forty
,
and
for
twenty
years
I
was
constantly
on
the
move
,
"
he
remarked
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nowadays
I
'm
glad
to
be
able
to
settle
down
in
England
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
moment
later
I
heard
the
sound
of
a
car
leaving
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
that
my
car
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
rather
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
"
Probably
your
man
is
taking
it
round
to
the
back
in
order
to
put
it
under
cover
.
<EOS>
Hark
!
<EOS>
it
has
started
to
rain
.
"
 
<EOS>
To
me
,
however
,
the
sound
,
growing
fainter
,
was
very
much
as
though
Bennett
had
driven
the
car
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
wines
which
Henry
served
so
quietly
and
sedately
were
of
the
best
.
<EOS>
But
both
my
host
and
myself
drank
little
.
 
<EOS>
Sandford
was
telling
me
of
the
strange
romance
concerning
his
sister
Ellen
and
young
Bingham
--
a
man
who
had
come
into
eight
thousand
a
year
from
his
uncle
,
and
only
a
few
days
later
had
met
with
an
accident
in
Swindon
,
having
been
knocked
down
by
a
train
at
a
level
-
crossing
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
,
after
dessert
,
our
conversation
ran
upon
ports
and
their
vintages
,
when
suddenly
my
host
remarked
:
 
"
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
are
a
connoisseur
of
brandies
,
but
I
happen
to
have
a
couple
of
rather
rare
vintages
.
<EOS>
Let
's
try
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
confessed
I
knew
<EOS>
but
little
about
brandies
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
teach
you
how
to
test
them
in
future
,
"
he
laughed
,
adding
,
"
Henry
,
bring
up
those
three
old
cognacs
,
a
bottle
of
ordinary
brandy
,
and
some
liqueur
-
glasses
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
a
dozen
little
glasses
made
their
appearance
on
a
tray
,
together
with
four
bottles
of
brandy
,
three
unlabelled
,
while
the
fourth
bore
the
label
of
a
well
-
known
brand
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
generally
known
,
I
think
,
that
one
can
not
test
brandy
with
any
degree
of
accuracy
by
the
palate
,
"
he
said
,
removing
his
cigar
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
n't
aware
of
that
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'll
show
you
,
"
he
went
on
,
and
taking
four
glasses
in
a
row
he
poured
a
little
spirit
out
of
each
of
the
bottles
into
the
bottoms
of
the
glasses
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
twisted
each
glass
round
in
order
to
wet
the
inside
with
the
spirit
,
and
the
surplus
he
emptied
into
his
finger
-
bowl
.
<EOS>
Then
,
handing
me
two
,
he
said
:
"
Just
hold
one
in
each
hand
till
they
're
warm
.
<EOS>
So
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
taking
the
remaining
two
he
held
one
in
the
hollow
of
each
hand
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
couple
or
three
minutes
we
held
them
thus
while
he
chatted
about
the
various
vintages
.
<EOS>
Then
we
placed
them
in
a
row
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
he
said
,
"
take
up
each
one
separately
and
smell
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
did
so
,
and
found
a
most
pleasant
perfume
--
each
,
however
,
quite
separate
and
distinct
,
as
different
as
eau
-
de
-
Cologne
is
from
lavender
water
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
he
said
,
after
sniffing
at
one
glass
,
"
is
1815
-
-Waterloo
year
--
a
magnificent
vintage
.
<EOS>
And
this
,
"
he
went
on
,
handing
me
the
second
glass
,
"
is
1829
-
-very
excellent
,
but
quite
a
distinct
perfume
,
you
notice
.
<EOS>
The
third
is
1864
-
-also
good
.
<EOS>
Of
the
1815
I
very
fortunately
have
two
bottles
.
<EOS>
Bellamy
,
in
Pall
Mall
,
has
three
bottles
,
and
there
are
perhaps
four
bottles
in
all
Paris
.
<EOS>
That
is
all
that
's
left
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
fourth
--
smell
it
--
is
the
ordinary
brandy
of
commerce
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
did
so
,
but
the
odour
was
nauseating
after
the
sweet
and
distinct
perfume
of
the
other
three
.
 
<EOS>
"
Just
try
the
1815
,
"
he
urged
,
carefully
pouring
out
about
a
third
of
a
glass
of
the
precious
pale
gold
liquid
and
handing
it
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
sipped
it
,
finding
it
exceedingly
pleasant
to
the
palate
.
<EOS>
So
old
was
it
that
it
seemed
to
have
lost
all
its
strength
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
really
delicious
liqueur
--
the
liqueur
of
a
gourmet
,
and
assuredly
a
fitting
conclusion
to
that
excellent
repast
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
'll
have
the
'
64
,
"
he
said
,
pouring
out
a
glass
and
swallowing
it
with
all
the
gusto
of
a
man
whose
chief
delight
was
the
satisfaction
of
his
stomach
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
a
cigarette
from
the
big
silver
box
he
handed
me
,
and
I
stretched
out
my
hand
for
the
matches
....
<EOS>
Beyond
that
,
curiously
enough
,
I
recollect
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
But
stay
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
seeing
,
as
though
rising
from
out
a
hazy
grey
mist
,
a
woman
's
face
--
the
countenance
of
a
very
pretty
girl
,
about
eighteen
,
with
big
blue
wide
-
open
eyes
and
very
fair
silky
hair
--
a
girl
,
whose
eyes
bore
in
them
a
hideous
look
of
inexpressible
horror
.
 
<EOS>
Next
instant
the
blackness
of
unconsciousness
fell
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
recovered
I
was
amazed
to
find
myself
in
bed
,
with
the
yellow
wintry
sunlight
streaming
into
the
low
,
old
-
fashioned
room
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
--
how
long
I
know
not
--
I
lay
there
staring
at
the
diamond
-
paned
window
straight
before
me
,
vaguely
wondering
what
had
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
A
sound
at
last
struck
the
right
chord
of
my
memory
--
the
sound
of
my
host
's
voice
exclaiming
cheerily
:
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
feel
,
old
chap
?
<EOS>
Better
,
I
hope
,
after
your
long
sleep
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
it
's
nearly
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Two
o'clock
!
 
<EOS>
After
a
struggle
I
succeeded
in
sitting
up
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
occurred
?
<EOS>
"
I
managed
to
gasp
.
<EOS>
"
I
--
I
do
n't
exactly
remember
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
nothing
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
declared
my
friend
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
a
bit
tired
last
night
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
So
I
thought
I
would
n't
disturb
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
's
Bennett
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Downstairs
with
the
car
,
waiting
till
you
feel
quite
right
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
then
realised
for
the
first
time
that
I
was
still
dressed
.
<EOS>
Only
my
boots
and
collar
and
tie
had
been
removed
.
 
<EOS>
Much
puzzled
,
and
wondering
whether
it
were
actually
possible
that
I
had
taken
too
much
wine
,
I
rose
to
my
feet
and
slowly
assumed
my
boots
.
 
<EOS>
Was
the
man
standing
before
me
a
friend
,
or
was
he
an
enemy
?
 
<EOS>
I
recollected
most
distinctly
sampling
the
brandy
,
but
beyond
that
--
absolutely
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
At
my
host
's
orders
Henry
brought
me
up
a
refreshing
cup
of
tea
and
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
,
during
which
Sandford
declared
that
"
such
little
annoying
incidents
occur
in
the
life
of
every
man
,
"
I
descended
and
found
Bennett
waiting
with
the
car
before
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
grasped
my
host
's
hand
in
farewell
he
whispered
confidentially
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
's
say
nothing
about
it
in
future
.
<EOS>
I
'll
call
and
see
you
in
town
in
a
week
or
two
--
if
I
may
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mechanically
I
declared
that
I
should
be
delighted
,
and
mounting
into
the
car
we
glided
down
the
drive
to
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
My
brain
was
awhirl
,
and
I
was
in
no
mood
to
talk
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
sat
with
the
frosty
air
blowing
upon
my
fevered
brow
as
we
travelled
back
to
Colchester
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
you
intended
staying
the
night
,
sir
,
"
Bennett
ventured
to
remark
just
before
we
entered
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
,
Bennett
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
sent
word
to
me
soon
after
we
arrived
,
telling
me
to
return
at
noon
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
So
I
went
back
to
'
<EOS>
The
Cups
,
'
and
spent
all
this
morning
on
the
engines
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
gave
you
that
message
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Sandford
's
man
,
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
sat
in
silence
.
<EOS>
What
could
it
mean
?
<EOS>
What
mystery
was
there
?
 
<EOS>
As
an
abstemious
man
I
felt
quite
convinced
that
I
had
not
taken
too
much
wine
.
<EOS>
A
single
liqueur
-
glass
of
brandy
certainly
could
never
have
produced
such
an
effect
upon
me
.
<EOS>
And
strangely
enough
that
girl
's
face
,
so
shadowy
,
so
sweet
,
and
yet
so
distorted
by
horror
,
was
ever
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
Three
weeks
after
the
curious
incident
,
having
concluded
my
survey
,
I
found
myself
back
in
Guilford
Street
,
my
journey
at
last
ended
.
<EOS>
Pleasant
,
indeed
,
it
was
to
sit
again
at
one
's
own
fireside
after
those
wet
,
never
-
ending
muddy
roads
upon
which
I
had
lived
for
so
long
,
and
very
soon
I
settled
down
to
arrange
the
mass
of
material
I
had
collected
and
write
my
book
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
days
after
my
return
,
in
order
to
redeem
my
promise
and
to
learn
more
of
Charles
Sandford
,
I
called
at
the
address
of
the
queer
old
hump
-
backed
widow
in
Earl
's
Court
Road
.
 
<EOS>
To
my
surprise
,
I
found
the
house
in
question
empty
,
with
every
evidence
of
its
having
been
to
let
for
a
year
or
more
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
mistake
in
the
number
;
it
was
printed
upon
her
card
.
<EOS>
This
discovery
caused
me
increasing
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
it
all
mean
?
 
<EOS>
Through
many
weeks
I
sat
in
my
rooms
in
Bloomsbury
constantly
at
work
upon
my
book
.
<EOS>
The
technicalities
were
many
and
the
difficulties
not
a
few
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
latter
--
and
perhaps
the
chief
one
--
was
to
so
disguise
the
real
vulnerable
points
of
our
country
which
I
had
discovered
on
my
tour
with
military
experts
as
to
mislead
the
Germans
,
who
might
seek
to
make
use
of
the
information
I
conveyed
.
<EOS>
The
book
,
to
be
of
value
,
had
,
I
recognised
,
to
be
correct
in
detail
,
yet
at
the
same
time
it
must
suppress
all
facts
that
might
be
of
use
to
a
foreign
Power
.
 
<EOS>
The
incident
near
Colchester
had
nearly
passed
from
my
mind
,
when
one
night
in
February
,
1909
,
I
chanced
to
be
having
supper
with
Ray
Raymond
and
Vera
at
the
"
Carlton
,
"
when
at
the
table
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
big
room
sat
a
smart
,
dark
-
haired
young
man
with
a
pretty
girl
in
turquoise
-
blue
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
looked
across
,
our
eyes
met
.
<EOS>
In
an
instant
I
recollected
that
I
had
seen
that
countenance
somewhere
before
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
It
was
actually
the
face
of
that
nightmare
of
mine
after
sampling
Sandford
's
old
cognac
!
<EOS>
I
sat
there
staring
at
her
,
like
a
man
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
The
countenance
was
the
sweetest
and
most
perfect
I
had
ever
gazed
upon
.
<EOS>
Yet
why
had
I
seen
it
in
my
unconsciousness
?
 
<EOS>
I
noticed
that
she
started
.
<EOS>
Then
,
turning
her
head
,
she
leaned
over
and
whispered
something
to
her
companion
.
<EOS>
Next
moment
,
pulling
her
cloak
about
her
shoulders
,
she
rose
,
and
they
both
left
hurriedly
.
 
<EOS>
What
could
her
fear
imply
?
<EOS>
Why
was
she
in
such
terror
of
me
?
<EOS>
That
look
of
horror
which
I
had
seen
on
that
memorable
night
was
again
there
--
yet
only
for
one
single
second
.
 
<EOS>
My
impulse
was
to
rise
and
dash
after
the
pair
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
not
being
acquainted
with
her
,
I
should
only
,
by
so
doing
,
make
a
fool
of
myself
and
also
annoy
my
lady
friend
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
for
many
days
and
many
weeks
the
remembrance
of
that
sweet
and
dainty
figure
ever
haunted
me
.
<EOS>
I
took
a
holiday
,
spending
greater
part
of
the
time
on
a
friend
's
yacht
in
the
Norwegian
fjords
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
could
not
get
away
from
that
face
and
the
curious
mystery
attaching
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
On
my
return
home
,
I
was
next
day
rung
up
on
the
telephone
by
my
friend
Major
Carmichael
,
of
the
Intelligence
Department
of
the
War
Office
,
who
had
been
one
of
my
assistants
in
preparing
the
forthcoming
book
.
<EOS>
At
his
urgent
request
I
went
round
to
see
him
in
Whitehall
,
and
on
being
ushered
into
his
office
,
I
was
introduced
to
a
tall
,
dark
-
bearded
man
,
whose
name
I
understood
to
be
Shayler
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Jacox
,
"
exclaimed
the
Major
,
"
forgive
me
for
getting
you
here
in
<EOS>
order
to
cross
-
examine
you
,
but
both
Shayler
and
myself
are
eagerly
in
search
of
some
information
.
<EOS>
You
recollect
those
maps
of
yours
,
marked
with
all
sorts
of
confidential
memoranda
relating
to
the
East
Coast
--
facts
that
would
be
of
the
utmost
value
to
the
German
War
Office
--
what
did
you
do
with
them
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
deposited
them
here
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
're
still
here
,
"
was
my
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
But
you
'll
recollect
my
warning
long
ago
,
when
you
were
reconnoitring
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
allow
them
to
pass
out
of
your
hands
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
.
<EOS>
I
carried
them
in
my
portfolio
,
the
key
of
which
was
always
on
my
chain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
what
do
you
think
of
these
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
walking
to
a
side
table
where
lay
a
pile
of
twenty
or
thirty
glass
photographic
negatives
.
<EOS>
And
taking
up
one
of
them
,
he
handed
it
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
photograph
of
one
of
my
own
maps
!
<EOS>
The
plan
was
the
section
of
country
in
the
vicinity
of
Glasgow
.
<EOS>
Upon
it
I
saw
notes
in
my
own
handwriting
,
the
tracing
of
the
telegraph
wires
with
the
communications
of
each
wire
,
and
dozens
of
other
facts
of
supreme
importance
to
the
invader
.
 
<EOS>
"
Great
heavens
!
<EOS>
"
I
gasped
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
did
you
get
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Shayler
will
tell
you
,
my
dear
fellow
!
"
answered
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
It
seems
that
you
've
been
guilty
of
some
sad
indiscretion
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
attached
to
the
Special
Department
at
New
Scotland
Yard
,
"
explained
the
dark
-
bearded
man
.
<EOS>
"
Two
months
ago
a
member
of
the
secret
service
in
the
employ
of
our
Foreign
Office
made
a
report
from
Berlin
that
a
young
girl
,
named
Gertie
Drew
,
living
in
a
Bloomsbury
boarding
-
house
,
had
approached
the
German
military
attache
offering
,
for
three
thousand
pounds
,
to
supply
him
with
photographs
of
a
number
of
confidential
plans
of
our
eastern
counties
and
of
the
Clyde
defences
.
<EOS>
The
attache
had
reported
to
the
War
Office
in
Berlin
,
hence
the
knowledge
obtained
by
the
British
secret
agent
.
<EOS>
The
matter
was
at
once
placed
in
my
hands
,
and
since
that
time
I
have
kept
careful
observation
upon
the
girl
--
who
has
been
a
photographer
's
assistant
--
and
those
in
association
with
her
.
<EOS>
The
result
is
that
I
have
fortunately
managed
to
obtain
possession
of
these
negatives
of
your
annotated
plans
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
how
?
<EOS>
"
I
demanded
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
making
a
bold
move
,
"
was
the
detective
's
reply
.
<EOS>
"
The
Germans
were
already
bargaining
for
these
negatives
when
I
became
convinced
that
the
girl
was
only
the
tool
of
a
man
who
had
also
been
a
photographer
,
and
who
had
led
a
very
adventurous
life
--
an
American
living
away
in
the
country
,
near
Colchester
,
under
the
name
of
Charles
Sandford
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Sandford
!
<EOS>
"
I
gasped
,
staring
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
girl
like
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Here
is
her
portrait
,
"
was
the
detective
's
reply
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
It
was
the
sweet
face
of
my
nightmare
!
 
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
discovered
regarding
Sandford
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
presently
,
when
I
had
related
to
the
two
men
the
story
of
the
meeting
at
Salisbury
and
also
my
night
's
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
"
Though
born
in
America
and
adopting
an
English
name
,
his
father
was
German
,
and
we
strongly
suspect
him
of
having
,
on
several
occasions
,
sold
information
to
Germany
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
,
feeling
quite
certain
of
my
ground
,
I
went
down
into
Essex
with
a
search
warrant
and
made
an
examination
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Upstairs
I
found
a
very
complete
photographic
plant
,
and
concealed
beneath
the
floor
-
boards
in
the
dining
-
room
<EOS>
was
a
box
containing
these
negatives
,
many
of
them
being
of
your
maps
of
the
Clyde
defences
,
which
they
were
just
about
to
dispose
of
.
<EOS>
The
man
had
got
wind
that
we
were
keeping
observation
upon
him
,
and
had
already
fled
.
<EOS>
The
gang
consisted
of
an
old
hump
-
backed
woman
,
who
posed
as
his
mother
,
a
young
woman
,
who
he
said
was
his
married
sister
,
but
who
was
really
the
wife
of
his
man
-
servant
,
and
the
girl
Drew
,
who
was
his
photographic
assistant
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
's
the
girl
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
do
n't
intend
to
arrest
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
If
you
saw
her
perhaps
you
might
induce
her
to
tell
you
the
truth
.
<EOS>
The
plot
to
photograph
those
plans
while
you
were
insensible
was
certainly
a
cleverly
contrived
one
,
and
it
's
equally
certain
that
the
two
women
you
met
in
Salisbury
only
travelled
with
you
in
order
to
be
convinced
that
you
really
carried
the
precious
maps
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
admitted
,
utterly
amazed
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
most
cleverly
trapped
,
but
it
is
most
fortunate
that
we
were
forewarned
,
and
that
our
zealous
friends
across
the
water
have
been
prevented
from
purchasing
the
detailed
exposure
of
our
most
vulnerable
points
.
"
 
<EOS>
That
afternoon
,
Gertie
Drew
,
the
neat
-
waisted
girl
with
the
fair
face
,
walked
timidly
into
my
room
,
and
together
we
sat
for
fully
an
hour
,
during
which
time
she
explained
how
the
man
Sandford
had
abstracted
the
portfolio
from
my
car
and
substituted
an
almost
exact
replica
,
prior
to
sending
Bennett
back
to
Colchester
,
and
how
at
the
moment
of
my
unconsciousness
--
as
he
was
searching
me
for
my
key
--
she
had
entered
the
dining
-
room
when
I
had
opened
my
eyes
,
and
staring
at
her
had
accused
her
of
poisoning
me
.
<EOS>
She
knew
she
had
been
recognised
,
and
that
had
caused
her
alarm
in
the
"
Carlton
.
"
 
<EOS>
That
Sandford
had
managed
to
replace
the
portfolio
in
the
car
and
abstract
the
replica
next
day
was
explained
,
and
that
he
had
held
the
girl
completely
in
his
power
was
equally
apparent
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
I
have
since
obtained
for
her
a
situation
with
a
well
-
known
firm
of
photographers
in
Regent
Street
,
where
she
still
remains
.
<EOS>
The
hump
-
backed
woman
and
her
pseudo
-
daughter
have
never
been
seen
since
,
but
only
a
couple
of
months
ago
there
was
recovered
from
the
Rhine
at
Coblenz
<EOS>
the
body
of
a
man
whose
head
was
fearfully
battered
,
and
whom
the
police
,
by
his
clothes
and
papers
upon
him
,
identified
as
Charles
Sandford
,
the
man
with
whom
I
shall
ever
remember
partaking
of
that
peculiarly
seductive
glass
of
1815
cognac
.

CHAPTER
XI
 
<EOS>
THE
PERIL
OF
LONDON
  
<EOS>
Certain
information
obtained
by
Ray
led
us
to
adopt
a
novel
method
of
trapping
one
of
the
Kaiser
's
secret
agents
.
 
<EOS>
About
six
months
after
my
curious
motoring
adventure
in
Essex
<EOS>
I
sent
to
the
_
Berliner
Tageblatt
_
,
in
Berlin
,
an
advertisement
,
offering
myself
as
English
valet
to
any
German
gentleman
coming
to
England
,
declaring
that
I
had
excellent
references
,
and
that
I
,
Henry
Dickson
,
had
been
in
service
with
several
English
noblemen
.
 
<EOS>
The
replies
forwarded
to
me
caused
us
considerable
excitement
.
<EOS>
Vera
was
with
us
at
New
Stone
Buildings
when
the
postman
brought
the
bulky
packet
,
and
we
at
once
proceeded
to
read
them
one
by
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
Holloa
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
holding
up
one
of
the
letters
.
<EOS>
"
Here
you
are
,
Mr.
Jacox
!
<EOS>
The
Baron
Heinrich
von
Ehrenburg
has
replied
!
"
 
<EOS>
Eagerly
we
read
the
formal
letter
from
the
German
aristocrat
,
dated
from
the
Leipziger
Strasse
,
Berlin
,
stating
that
,
being
about
to
take
up
his
residence
in
London
,
he
was
in
want
of
a
good
and
reliable
English
servant
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
at
the
Ritz
Hotel
in
four
days
'
time
,
and
he
made
an
appointment
for
me
to
call
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
cried
Ray
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
ask
very
little
wages
.
<EOS>
Germans
are
a
stingy
lot
.
<EOS>
The
Baron
has
been
acting
as
a
secret
agent
of
the
Kaiser
in
Paris
,
but
had
to
fly
on
account
of
the
recent
Ullmo
affair
at
Toulon
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
very
clever
spy
--
about
as
clever
,
indeed
,
as
Hartmann
himself
.
<EOS>
Why
he
is
coming
to
England
is
not
quite
clear
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
find
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
For
the
next
four
days
I
waited
in
great
anxiety
,
and
when
,
at
the
appointed
hour
,
I
presented
myself
at
the
"
Ritz
"
and
was
shown
into
the
private
salon
,
the
middle
-
aged
,
fair
-
haired
,
rather
elegant
man
eyed
me
up
and
down
swiftly
as
I
stood
before
him
with
great
deference
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
about
to
play
a
dangerous
game
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
number
of
questions
,
and
an
examination
of
my
credentials
,
all
of
which
,
I
may
as
well
admit
,
had
been
prepared
by
Ray
and
Vera
,
he
engaged
me
,
and
that
same
evening
I
entered
upon
my
duties
,
greatly
to
the
satisfaction
of
Vera
and
her
lover
.
 
<EOS>
Fortunately
I
was
not
known
at
the
"
Ritz
,
"
and
was
therefore
able
for
the
first
week
or
so
to
do
my
valeting
,
brushing
my
master
's
clothes
,
polishing
his
boots
,
getting
out
his
dress
-
suit
,
and
other
such
duties
,
undisturbed
,
my
eyes
,
however
,
always
open
to
get
a
glimpse
of
any
papers
that
might
be
left
in
the
pockets
or
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
Twice
he
drove
to
Pont
Street
and
dined
with
Hartmann
.
<EOS>
The
pair
were
in
frequent
consultation
,
it
seemed
,
for
one
afternoon
the
chief
of
the
German
spies
in
England
called
,
and
was
closeted
closely
with
my
master
for
fully
two
hours
.
 
<EOS>
I
stood
outside
the
door
,
but
unfortunately
the
doors
of
the
"
Ritz
"
are
so
constructed
that
nothing
can
be
heard
in
the
corridors
.
<EOS>
All
I
knew
was
that
,
on
being
called
in
to
give
a
message
over
the
telephone
,
I
saw
lying
on
the
table
between
them
several
English
six
-
inch
ordnance
maps
.
 
<EOS>
No
master
could
have
been
more
generous
than
the
Baron
.
<EOS>
He
was
tall
,
rather
dandified
,
and
seemed
a
great
favourite
with
the
ladies
.
<EOS>
Hartmann
had
introduced
him
to
certain
well
-
known
members
of
the
German
colony
in
London
,
and
he
passed
as
the
possessor
of
a
big
estate
near
Cochem
,
on
the
Moselle
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
one
day
while
I
was
brushing
his
coat
that
he
preferred
life
in
England
to
Germany
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
made
no
mention
of
his
residence
in
France
and
how
he
had
ingeniously
induced
a
French
naval
officer
to
become
a
traitor
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
"
Ritz
"
we
,
later
on
,
removed
into
expensive
quarters
at
"
Claridge
's
,
"
and
here
my
master
received
frequent
visits
from
a
shabby
,
thin
-
faced
,
shrivelled
-
up
old
foreigner
,
whom
I
took
to
be
a
Dutchman
,
his
name
being
Mr.
Van
Nierop
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
he
called
the
Baron
and
he
held
close
consultation
,
sometimes
for
hours
.
<EOS>
We
travelled
to
Eastbourne
,
Bournemouth
,
Birmingham
,
Edinburgh
,
Glasgow
,
and
other
cities
,
yet
ever
and
anon
the
shabby
old
Dutchman
seemed
to
turn
up
at
odd
times
and
places
,
as
though
springing
from
nowhere
.
 
<EOS>
When
absent
from
London
,
the
Baron
frequently
sent
telegraphic
messages
in
cipher
to
a
registered
address
in
London
.
<EOS>
Were
these
,
I
wondered
,
intended
for
Hartmann
or
for
the
mysterious
Van
Nierop
?
 
<EOS>
The
old
fellow
seemed
to
haunt
us
everywhere
,
dogging
our
footsteps
continually
,
and
appearing
in
all
sorts
of
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
places
with
his
long
,
greasy
overcoat
,
shabby
hat
,
and
shuffling
gait
,
by
which
many
mistook
him
for
a
Hebrew
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
more
closely
I
watched
my
aristocratic
master
,
the
more
convinced
I
became
that
Van
Nierop
<EOS>
and
he
were
acting
in
collusion
.
<EOS>
But
of
what
was
in
progress
I
could
obtain
no
inkling
.
 
<EOS>
Frequently
we
moved
quickly
from
one
place
to
another
,
as
though
my
master
feared
pursuit
,
then
we
went
suddenly
to
Aix
,
Vichy
,
and
Carlsbad
,
and
remained
away
for
some
weeks
.
<EOS>
Early
in
the
autumn
we
were
back
again
at
a
suite
of
well
-
furnished
chambers
in
Clarges
Street
,
off
Piccadilly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
expect
,
Dickson
,
that
we
shall
be
in
London
some
months
,
"
the
Baron
had
said
to
me
on
the
second
morning
after
we
had
installed
ourselves
with
our
luggage
.
<EOS>
The
place
belonged
to
a
wealthy
young
peer
of
racing
proclivities
,
and
was
replete
with
every
comfort
.
<EOS>
All
had
been
left
just
as
it
was
,
even
to
an
open
box
of
cigars
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
had
gone
on
a
trip
round
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
third
day
--
a
very
wet
and
dismal
one
,
I
recollect
--
the
old
Dutchman
arrived
.
<EOS>
The
Baron
was
out
,
therefore
he
waited
--
waited
in
patience
for
six
long
hours
for
his
return
.
<EOS>
When
my
master
re
-
entered
,
the
pair
sat
together
for
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Then
suddenly
the
Baron
shouted
to
me
,
"
Dickson
!
<EOS>
Pack
my
suit
-
case
and
biggest
kit
-
bag
at
once
.
<EOS>
Put
in
both
dress
-
coat
and
dinner
-
jacket
.
<EOS>
And
I
sha
n't
want
you
.
<EOS>
You
'll
stay
here
and
mind
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
I
replied
,
and
began
briskly
to
execute
his
orders
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
shabby
old
fellow
had
gone
,
the
Baron
called
me
into
the
sitting
-
room
and
gave
me
two
cipher
telegrams
,
one
written
on
the
yellow
form
used
for
foreign
messages
.
<EOS>
The
first
,
which
he
had
numbered
"
1
"
in
blue
pencil
,
was
addressed
"
Zaza
,
Berlin
,
"
and
the
second
was
to
"
Tejada
,
Post
Office
,
Manchester
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
These
,
Dickson
,
I
shall
leave
with
you
,
for
I
may
want
them
despatched
.
<EOS>
Send
them
the
instant
you
receive
word
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
which
to
send
.
<EOS>
It
's
half
-
past
eight
.
<EOS>
I
leave
Charing
Cross
at
nine
,
but
can
not
give
you
any
fixed
address
.
<EOS>
Here
's
money
to
get
along
with
.
<EOS>
Wait
here
until
my
return
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
was
sorely
disappointed
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
he
was
a
spy
and
was
in
England
for
some
fixed
purpose
.
<EOS>
But
what
it
was
I
could
not
discover
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
,
"
he
added
,
as
though
it
were
an
afterthought
,
"
if
any
one
should
by
chance
inquire
about
Mr.
Van
Nierop
--
whether
you
know
him
,
or
if
he
has
been
here
--
remember
that
you
know
nothing
--
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
understand
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
sir
,
"
was
my
response
.
 
<EOS>
Five
minutes
later
,
refusing
to
allow
me
to
accompany
him
to
the
station
,
he
drove
away
into
Piccadilly
with
his
luggage
upon
a
hansom
,
and
thus
was
I
left
alone
for
an
indefinite
period
.
 
<EOS>
That
evening
I
went
round
to
Bruton
Street
,
where
I
saw
Ray
,
and
described
what
had
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
staring
into
the
fire
in
silence
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
he
answered
at
last
,
"
if
what
I
surmise
be
true
,
Jack
,
the
Baron
ought
to
be
back
here
in
about
a
week
.
<EOS>
Continue
to
keep
both
eyes
and
ears
open
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
deep
game
being
played
,
I
am
certain
.
<EOS>
He
's
with
Hartmann
very
often
.
<EOS>
Recollect
what
I
told
you
about
the
clever
manner
in
which
the
Baron
conducted
the
affair
at
Toulon
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
been
entirely
successful
had
n't
a
woman
given
Ullmo
away
.
<EOS>
See
me
as
little
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
You
never
know
who
may
be
watching
you
during
the
Baron
's
absence
.
"
 
<EOS>
On
the
next
evening
I
went
out
for
a
stroll
towards
Piccadilly
Circus
and
accidentally
met
a
man
I
knew
,
a
German
named
Karl
Stieber
,
a
man
of
about
thirty
,
who
was
valet
to
a
young
gentleman
who
lived
in
the
flat
beneath
us
.
 
<EOS>
Together
we
descended
to
that
noisy
cafe
beneath
the
Hotel
de
l'Europe
in
Leicester
Square
,
where
we
met
four
other
friends
of
Karl
's
,
servants
like
himself
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
sat
together
,
he
told
me
that
his
brother
was
head
-
waiter
at
a
little
French
restaurant
in
Dean
Street
,
Soho
,
called
"
La
Belle
Nicoise
,
"
a
place
where
one
could
obtain
real
Provencal
dishes
.
<EOS>
Then
,
I
on
my
part
,
told
him
of
my
own
position
and
my
travels
with
the
Baron
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
ascended
into
Leicester
Square
again
we
found
the
pavements
congested
,
for
Daly
's
,
the
Empire
,
and
the
Alhambra
had
just
disgorged
their
throngs
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
walked
with
me
he
turned
,
and
suddenly
asked
:
 
"
Since
you
've
been
in
London
has
old
Van
Nierop
visited
the
Baron
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
started
in
quick
surprise
,
but
in
an
instant
recollected
my
master
's
injunctions
.
 
<EOS>
"
Van
Nierop
!
<EOS>
"
I
echoed
.
<EOS>
"
Whom
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
But
he
only
laughed
knowingly
,
exclaiming
:
 
"
<EOS>
All
right
.
<EOS>
You
'll
deny
all
knowledge
of
him
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
Dickson
,
take
the
advice
of
one
who
knows
,
and
be
ever
watchful
.
<EOS>
Take
care
of
your
own
self
.
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
my
friend
,
who
seemed
to
possess
some
secret
knowledge
,
vanished
in
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
he
ascended
and
called
upon
me
,
and
we
sometimes
used
to
spend
our
evenings
together
in
that
illicit
little
gaming
-
room
behind
a
shop
in
Old
Compton
Street
,
a
place
much
frequented
by
foreign
servants
.
 
<EOS>
I
noticed
,
however
,
though
he
was
very
inquisitive
regarding
the
Baron
and
his
movements
,
he
would
never
give
me
any
reason
.
<EOS>
He
sometimes
warned
me
mysteriously
that
I
was
in
danger
.
<EOS>
But
to
me
his
words
appeared
absurd
.
 
<EOS>
One
evening
,
in
the
third
week
of
December
,
he
and
I
were
in
the
Baron
's
room
chatting
,
when
a
ring
came
at
the
door
,
and
I
found
the
Baron
himself
,
looking
very
tired
and
fagged
.
<EOS>
He
almost
staggered
into
his
sitting
-
room
,
brushing
past
Karl
on
his
way
.
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
different
clothes
,
and
I
scarcely
recognised
him
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
's
that
,
Dickson
?
"
<EOS>
he
demanded
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
told
you
I
forbade
visitors
here
!
<EOS>
Send
him
away
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
talk
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
obeyed
,
and
when
he
heard
the
door
close
the
Baron
,
who
I
noticed
was
travel
-
worn
and
dirty
,
with
a
soiled
collar
and
many
days
'
growth
of
beard
,
<EOS>
said
:
 
"
Do
n't
have
anybody
here
--
not
even
your
best
friend
,
Dickson
.
<EOS>
You
'd
admit
no
stranger
here
if
you
knew
the
truth
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
meaning
look
.
"
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
perhaps
you
do
n't
.
"
 
<EOS>
Then
,
after
he
had
gulped
down
the
cognac
I
had
brought
at
his
order
,
he
went
on
:
 
"
Now
,
listen
.
<EOS>
In
a
little
more
than
a
week
it
will
be
New
Year
's
day
.
<EOS>
On
that
day
there
will
arrive
for
me
a
card
of
greeting
.
<EOS>
You
will
open
all
my
letters
on
that
morning
,
and
find
it
.
<EOS>
Either
it
will
be
perfectly
plain
and
bear
the
words
'
A
Happy
New
Year
'
in
frosted
letters
,
or
else
it
will
be
a
water
-
colour
snow
scene
--
a
house
,
bare
trees
,
moonlight
,
you
know
the
kind
of
thing
--
with
the
words
'
The
Compliments
of
the
Season
.
'
<EOS>
Upon
either
will
be
written
in
violet
ink
,
in
a
woman
's
hand
,
the
words
in
English
,
'
To
dear
Heinrich
.
'
<EOS>
You
understand
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Good
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
gave
you
two
telegrams
before
I
left
.
<EOS>
If
the
card
is
a
plain
one
,
burn
it
and
despatch
the
first
telegram
;
if
coloured
,
then
send
the
second
message
.
<EOS>
Do
you
follow
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
when
,
to
my
surprise
he
rose
,
and
instead
of
entering
his
bedroom
to
wash
,
he
simply
swallowed
a
second
glass
of
brandy
,
sighed
,
and
departed
,
saying
:
 
<EOS>
"
Remember
,
you
know
nothing
--
nothing
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
If
there
should
be
any
inquiries
about
me
,
keep
your
mouth
closed
.
"
 
<EOS>
Twice
<EOS>
my
friend
Stieber
called
in
the
days
that
followed
,
but
I
flattered
myself
that
from
me
he
learnt
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
morning
of
New
Year
's
day
five
letters
were
pushed
through
the
box
.
<EOS>
Eagerly
I
tore
them
open
.
<EOS>
The
last
,
bearing
a
Dutch
stamp
,
with
the
postmark
of
Utrecht
,
contained
the
expected
card
,
with
the
inscription
"
To
dear
Heinrich
,
"
a
small
hand
-
painted
scene
upon
celluloid
,
with
forget
-
me
-
nots
woven
round
the
words
"
With
the
Compliments
of
the
Season
.
"
 
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
later
,
having
burned
the
card
according
to
my
instructions
,
I
despatched
the
mysterious
message
to
Manchester
.
 
<EOS>
That
evening
,
about
ten
o'clock
,
Stieber
called
for
me
to
go
for
a
stroll
and
drink
a
New
Year
health
.
<EOS>
But
as
we
turned
from
Clarges
Street
into
Piccadilly
I
could
have
sworn
that
a
man
we
passed
in
the
darkness
was
old
Van
Nierop
.
<EOS>
I
made
no
remark
,
however
,
because
I
did
not
wish
to
draw
my
companion
's
attention
to
the
shuffling
old
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
Had
the
telegram
<EOS>
,
I
wondered
,
brought
him
to
London
?
 
<EOS>
Ten
minutes
later
,
in
the
Cafe
Monico
,
my
friend
Karl
lifted
his
glass
to
me
,
saying
:
 
"
<EOS>
Well
,
a
Happy
New
Year
,
my
dear
friend
.
<EOS>
Take
my
advice
,
and
do
n't
trust
your
Baron
too
implicitly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
You
always
speak
in
enigmas
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
he
laughed
,
and
would
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
dawned
.
<EOS>
Grey
and
muddy
,
it
was
rendered
more
dismal
by
my
loneliness
.
<EOS>
I
idled
away
the
morning
,
anxious
to
be
travelling
again
,
but
at
noon
there
was
a
caller
,
a
thin
,
pale
-
faced
girl
of
fifteen
or
so
,
poorly
dressed
and
evidently
of
the
working
-
class
.
 
<EOS>
When
,
in
response
to
her
question
,
I
had
told
her
my
name
,
she
said
:
 
"
I
've
been
sent
by
the
Baron
to
tell
you
he
wishes
to
see
you
very
particularly
to
-
night
at
nine
o'clock
,
at
this
address
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
handed
me
an
envelope
with
an
address
upon
it
,
and
then
went
down
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
The
address
I
read
was
:
"
4A
Bishop
's
Lane
,
Chiswick
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
mysterious
appointment
puzzled
me
,
but
after
spending
a
very
cheerless
day
,
I
hailed
a
taxi
-
cab
at
eight
o'clock
and
set
forth
for
Chiswick
,
a
district
to
which
I
had
never
before
been
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
we
found
ourselves
outside
an
old
-
fashioned
church
,
and
on
inquiry
I
was
told
by
a
boy
that
Bishop
's
Lane
was
at
the
end
of
a
footpath
which
led
through
the
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
dismissed
the
taxi
,
and
after
some
search
,
at
length
found
No
.
4A
,
an
old
-
fashioned
house
standing
alone
in
the
darkness
amid
a
large
garden
surrounded
by
high
,
bare
trees
--
a
house
built
in
the
long
ago
days
before
Chiswick
became
a
London
suburb
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
walked
up
the
path
the
door
was
opened
,
and
I
found
the
old
man
Van
Nierop
standing
behind
it
.
 
<EOS>
Without
a
word
he
ushered
me
into
a
back
room
,
which
,
to
my
surprise
,
was
carpetless
and
barely
furnished
.
<EOS>
Then
he
said
,
in
that
strange
croaking
voice
of
his
:
 
<EOS>
"
Your
master
will
be
here
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
He
's
delayed
.
<EOS>
Have
a
cigarette
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
took
one
from
the
packet
he
offered
,
and
still
puzzled
,
lit
it
and
sat
down
to
await
the
Baron
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
had
shuffled
out
,
and
I
was
left
alone
,
when
of
a
sudden
a
curious
drowsiness
overcame
me
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
there
must
have
been
a
narcotic
in
the
tobacco
,
for
I
undoubtedly
slept
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
awoke
I
found
,
to
my
amazement
,
that
I
could
not
use
my
arms
.
<EOS>
I
was
still
seated
in
the
wooden
arm
-
chair
,
but
my
arms
and
legs
were
bound
with
ropes
,
while
the
chair
itself
had
been
secured
to
four
iron
rings
screwed
into
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
Over
my
mouth
was
bound
a
cloth
so
that
I
could
not
speak
.
 
<EOS>
Before
me
,
his
thin
face
distorted
by
a
hideous
,
almost
demoniacal
laugh
of
triumph
,
stood
old
Van
Nierop
,
watching
me
as
I
recovered
consciousness
.
<EOS>
At
his
side
,
grinning
in
triumph
,
was
my
master
,
the
Baron
.
 
<EOS>
I
tried
to
ask
the
meaning
of
it
all
,
but
was
unable
.
 
<EOS>
"
See
,
see
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
old
Dutchman
,
pointing
with
his
bony
finger
to
the
dirty
table
near
me
,
whereon
a
candle
-
end
was
burning
straight
before
my
eyes
beside
a
good
-
sized
book
--
a
leather
-
bound
ledger
it
appeared
to
be
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
what
I
intend
doing
?
<EOS>
Well
,
I
'm
going
to
treat
you
as
all
English
spies
should
be
treated
.
<EOS>
That
candle
will
burn
low
in
five
minutes
and
sever
the
string
you
see
which
joins
the
wick
.
<EOS>
Look
what
that
innocent
-
looking
book
contains
!
"
<EOS>
and
with
a
peal
of
discordant
laughter
he
lifted
the
cover
,
showing
,
to
my
horror
,
that
it
was
a
box
<EOS>
,
wherein
reposed
a
small
glass
tube
filled
with
some
yellow
liquid
,
a
trigger
held
back
by
the
string
,
and
some
square
packets
wrapped
in
oiled
paper
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
what
this
is
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
slowly
and
distinctly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
moment
the
string
is
burned
through
,
the
hammer
will
fall
,
and
this
house
will
be
blown
to
atoms
.
<EOS>
That
book
contains
the
most
powerful
explosive
known
to
science
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
demand
an
explanation
,
for
though
I
struggled
,
I
could
not
speak
.
 
<EOS>
I
watched
the
old
man
fingering
with
fiendish
delight
the
terrible
machine
he
had
devised
for
my
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
and
your
friend
Raymond
thought
to
trap
us
!
"
said
the
Baron
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
you
see
,
he
who
laughs
last
laughs
best
.
<EOS>
Adieu
,
and
I
wish
you
a
pleasant
trip
,
my
young
friend
,
into
the
next
world
,
"
and
both
went
out
,
closing
the
door
after
them
.
 
<EOS>
All
was
silence
.
<EOS>
I
sat
there
helpless
,
pinioned
,
staring
at
the
burning
candle
and
awaiting
the
most
awful
death
that
can
await
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
those
moments
!
<EOS>
How
can
I
ever
adequately
describe
them
?
<EOS>
Suffice
it
to
say
that
my
hair
was
dark
on
that
morning
,
but
in
those
terrible
moments
of
mental
agony
,
of
fear
and
horror
,
it
became
streaked
with
grey
.
 
<EOS>
Lower
and
still
lower
burned
the
flame
,
steadily
,
imperceptibly
,
<EOS>
yet
,
alas
!
<EOS>
too
sure
.
<EOS>
Each
second
brought
me
nearer
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
face
to
face
with
death
.
 
<EOS>
Frantically
<EOS>
and
fiercely
I
fought
to
wrench
myself
free
--
<EOS>
fought
until
a
great
exhaustion
fell
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
as
the
candle
had
burned
until
the
flame
was
actually
touching
that
thin
string
which
held
me
between
life
and
death
,
I
fainted
.
 
<EOS>
A
blinding
flash
,
a
terrific
explosion
that
deafened
me
,
and
a
feeling
of
sudden
numbness
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
myself
lying
on
the
path
outside
with
two
men
at
my
side
.
 
<EOS>
One
was
a
dark
-
bearded
,
thick
-
set
,
but
gentlemanly
-
looking
man
--
<EOS>
the
other
was
Ray
Raymond
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
house
where
I
had
been
,
scarcely
anything
remained
save
its
foundations
.
<EOS>
The
big
trees
in
the
garden
had
been
shattered
and
torn
down
,
and
every
window
in
the
neighbourhood
had
been
blown
in
,
to
the
intense
alarm
of
hundreds
of
people
who
were
now
rushing
along
the
dark
,
unfrequented
thoroughfare
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
God
!
"
cried
Ray
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
narrow
escape
you
've
had
!
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
you
take
my
advice
?
<EOS>
It
was
fortunate
that
,
suspecting
something
,
we
followed
you
here
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
,
"
he
said
,
introducing
his
friend
,
"
is
Bellamy
,
of
the
Special
Department
at
Scotland
Yard
.
<EOS>
We
just
discovered
you
in
time
.
<EOS>
Old
Van
Nierop
ran
inside
again
when
he
met
us
in
the
path
.
<EOS>
He
thought
he
had
time
to
escape
through
the
back
,
but
he
had
n't
.
<EOS>
He
's
been
blown
to
atoms
himself
,
as
well
as
the
Baron
,
and
thus
saved
us
the
trouble
of
extradition
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
was
too
exhausted
and
confused
to
reply
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
a
huge
crowd
was
already
gathering
,
the
fire
-
brigade
had
come
up
,
and
the
police
seemed
to
be
examining
the
debris
strewn
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
watched
the
Baron
<EOS>
well
,
but
not
quite
well
enough
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Jacox
,
"
Ray
said
.
<EOS>
"
They
evidently
suspected
you
of
prying
into
their
business
,
and
plotted
to
put
you
quietly
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
You
have
evidently
somehow
betrayed
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
what
was
their
business
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
I
searched
every
scrap
of
paper
in
the
Baron
's
rooms
,
but
was
never
able
to
discover
anything
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
the
truth
is
that
the
reason
the
Baron
came
to
England
was
in
order
to
take
a
house
in
this
secluded
spot
.
<EOS>
Aided
by
Van
Nierop
they
have
established
a
depot
close
by
in
readiness
for
the
coming
of
the
Kaiser
's
army
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
and
let
us
investigate
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
leading
me
to
a
stable
at
the
rear
of
another
house
about
fifty
yards
distant
,
he
,
aided
by
Bellamy
,
broke
open
the
padlocked
door
.
 
<EOS>
Within
we
found
great
piles
of
small
,
strongly
bound
boxes
containing
rifle
ammunition
,
together
with
about
sixty
cases
of
old
Martini
-
Henry
rifles
,
weapons
still
very
serviceable
at
close
quarters
,
a
quantity
of
revolvers
,
and
ten
cases
of
gun
-
cotton
--
quite
a
formidable
store
of
arms
and
ammunition
,
similar
to
that
we
found
in
Essex
,
and
intended
,
no
doubt
,
for
the
arming
of
the
horde
of
Germans
already
in
London
on
the
day
when
the
Kaiser
gives
the
signal
for
the
dash
upon
our
shores
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
only
one
of
the
depots
established
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
metropolis
,
"
Raymond
said
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
others
,
and
we
must
set
to
work
to
discover
them
.
<EOS>
Germany
leaves
nothing
to
chance
,
and
there
are
already
in
London
fifty
thousand
well
-
trained
men
of
the
Fatherland
,
most
of
whom
belong
to
secret
clubs
,
and
who
will
on
'
the
Day
'
rise
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
en
<EOS>
masse
_
<EOS>
at
the
signal
of
invasion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
the
Baron
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
,
half
dazed
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
've
just
recovered
portions
of
him
,
"
replied
Ray
,
with
a
grin
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
that
New
Year
's
card
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
,
and
then
amid
the
excitement
proceeded
to
tell
Bellamy
and
my
companion
what
had
happened
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
message
you
sent
to
Manchester
was
to
acquaint
Hartmann
,
who
is
staying
at
this
moment
at
the
Midland
Grand
Hotel
,
with
their
intended
vengeance
upon
you
,
my
dear
old
chap
.
<EOS>
Nierop
was
a
Dutch
merchant
in
the
City
,
and
his
habit
was
to
import
arms
and
ammunition
in
small
quantities
,
and
distribute
them
to
the
different
secret
depots
,
one
of
which
we
know
is
somewhere
near
the
'
Adelaide
,
'
in
Chalk
Farm
Road
,
another
is
at
a
house
in
Malmesbury
Road
,
<EOS>
Canning
Town
,
a
third
in
Shepperton
Street
,
Hoxton
,
and
a
fourth
is
said
to
be
close
by
the
chapel
in
Cowley
Road
,
Leytonstone
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
there
are
others
besides
,
"
remarked
Bellamy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
remarked
Raymond
,
"
one
is
certainly
somewhere
in
Crowland
Road
,
South
Tottenham
,
another
near
the
Gas
Works
at
Hornsey
,
and
others
somewhere
between
Highgate
Hill
and
the
New
River
reservoir
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
there
are
no
doubt
several
in
such
towns
as
Ipswich
,
Chelmsford
,
Yarmouth
,
and
Norwich
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
police
had
by
this
time
taken
possession
of
the
stable
,
but
no
information
was
given
to
the
public
,
fearing
that
a
panic
might
be
caused
if
the
truth
leaked
out
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
newspapers
and
the
public
believed
the
death
of
the
German
and
the
Dutchman
to
be
due
to
a
gas
explosion
--
at
least
that
was
what
the
police
reported
at
the
inquest
.
<EOS>
Next
day
the
arms
and
ammunition
were
quietly
removed
in
closed
vans
from
the
house
and
stable
which
the
spies
had
rented
,
and
conveyed
to
safe
keeping
at
Woolwich
--
where
,
I
believe
,
they
still
remain
as
evidence
of
the
German
intentions
.
 
<EOS>
Londoners
,
indeed
,
sadly
disregard
the
peril
in
which
they
are
placed
with
a
hostile
force
already
in
their
midst
--
an
advance
guard
of
the
enemy
already
on
the
alert
,
and
but
awaiting
the
landing
of
their
compatriots
from
the
Fatherland
.
 
<EOS>
No
sane
man
can
to
-
day
declare
that
,
with
our
maladministered
Navy
,
the
invasion
of
England
is
impossible
.
<EOS>
Invasion
is
not
a
"
scare
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
hard
fact
which
must
be
faced
,
if
we
are
not
to
fall
beneath
the
"
mailed
fist
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
peril
is
great
,
and
it
is
increasing
daily
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
are
strenuous
in
their
endeavours
to
make
every
preparation
for
the
successful
raid
upon
our
shores
.
 
<EOS>
As
an
instance
,
in
February
,
1909
,
what
may
well
be
described
as
a
careful
,
complete
,
and
systematic
photographic
survey
of
the
coast
between
the
Tyne
and
the
Tees
was
conducted
,
it
is
stated
,
by
a
party
of
foreigners
,
three
of
whom
were
Germans
.
 
<EOS>
Every
indentation
of
the
coast
,
and
especially
those
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
dunes
about
Heselden
and
Castle
Eden
,
was
faithfully
recorded
by
means
of
the
camera
,
photographs
being
taken
both
at
low
tide
and
at
high
tide
at
various
points
.
 
<EOS>
Considerable
attention
was
given
to
the
entrances
to
the
Tyne
,
Tees
and
Wear
,
and
also
to
the
Harbour
entrances
at
Seaham
Harbour
and
Hartlepool
;
whilst
the
positions
of
the
various
coast
batteries
and
coast
-
guard
stations
were
also
photographed
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
did
the
party
,
whose
operations
extended
over
a
period
of
several
weeks
,
confine
their
attention
solely
to
the
coast
line
.
<EOS>
Railway
junctions
and
bridges
near
the
coast
,
collieries
,
and
even
farm
-
houses
were
photographed
;
in
fact
,
the
salient
features
of
the
countryside
bordering
the
sea
were
all
included
in
what
was
altogether
a
most
exhaustive
series
of
pictures
.
 
<EOS>
A
certain
number
of
films
were
developed
from
day
to
day
at
West
Hartlepool
,
something
like
two
hundred
pictures
in
all
being
dealt
with
,
but
these
formed
only
a
tithe
of
the
photographs
taken
,
and
the
undeveloped
films
,
together
with
the
prints
from
those
that
had
been
developed
,
were
despatched
direct
to
Hamburg
and
Berlin
,
while
some
were
sent
to
the
head
-
quarters
of
the
German
espionage
in
Pont
Street
,
London
.

CHAPTER
XII
 
<EOS>
HOW
GERMANY
FOMENTS
STRIFE
  
<EOS>
Ray
Raymond
had
been
engaged
watching
the
house
of
Hermann
Hartmann
in
Pont
Street
ever
since
our
discovery
of
the
secret
store
of
arms
and
ammunition
down
at
Chiswick
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
been
absent
at
Devonport
,
keeping
observation
upon
the
movements
of
two
Germans
who
had
once
or
twice
paid
visits
to
Hartmann
,
and
who
had
evidently
received
his
instructions
personally
.
<EOS>
The
two
men
in
question
were
known
to
us
as
spies
,
for
with
two
other
compatriots
we
had
found
them
,
only
three
months
before
,
busily
engaged
in
preparing
a
plan
of
the
water
-
mains
of
East
London
,
in
order
that
,
in
case
of
invasion
,
some
of
the
German
colony
could
destroy
the
principal
mains
and
thus
deprive
half
the
metropolis
of
drinking
-
water
.
 
<EOS>
In
Leeds
<EOS>
they
had
,
we
know
,
mapped
out
the
whole
water
-
supply
,
as
Barker
had
done
at
North
Shields
;
and
again
in
Sheffield
,
the
plans
of
which
were
in
Berlin
;
but
fortunately
we
had
discovered
them
at
work
in
London
,
and
had
been
able
to
prevent
them
from
accomplishing
their
object
.
<EOS>
Two
of
the
men
had
returned
to
Germany
on
being
detected
,
and
the
other
two
were
now
at
Devonport
,
where
I
had
been
living
for
a
month
in
irritating
inactivity
.
 
<EOS>
One
afternoon
,
on
receipt
of
a
telegram
from
Ray
,
I
immediately
returned
to
London
,
and
as
I
entered
the
flat
in
Bruton
Street
,
my
friend
said
:
 
"
The
great
_
agent
provocateur
_
of
the
German
Government
,
our
friend
Hermann
Hartmann
,
has
left
for
Russia
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
His
employers
have
sent
him
there
for
some
special
reason
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
wise
for
you
to
follow
,
and
ascertain
the
latest
move
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
think
so
,
I
'll
go
,
"
I
said
readily
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
take
my
place
down
at
Devonport
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
there
too
long
and
may
be
spotted
.
<EOS>
Where
has
Hartmann
gone
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
First
back
to
Berlin
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
ordered
to
go
to
Poland
on
a
special
mission
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
must
pick
him
up
in
Berlin
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
And
thus
it
was
arranged
.
<EOS>
Next
morning
I
obtained
a
special
_
visa
_
to
my
passport
from
the
Russian
Ambassador
,
whom
I
chanced
to
know
personally
,
and
at
2.20
left
Charing
Cross
for
Calais
,
bound
for
Berlin
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
puzzled
why
Hartmann
,
the
most
trusted
agent
of
the
Kaiser
's
secret
police
,
should
be
so
suddenly
transferred
to
Russian
territory
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
temporarily
,
no
doubt
,
but
it
behoved
us
to
have
knowledge
of
what
might
be
in
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
winter
,
and
the
journey
to
the
German
capital
was
cold
and
cheerless
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
had
not
been
there
six
hours
before
I
had
discovered
that
Hartmann
had
left
for
a
place
called
Ostrog
,
in
Eastern
Poland
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
lost
no
time
in
setting
forth
for
that
rather
obscure
place
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
nowadays
my
life
was
a
strange
one
,
full
of
romance
and
constant
change
,
of
excitement
--
and
sometimes
of
insecurity
.
 
<EOS>
For
what
reason
had
the
great
Hartmann
been
sent
so
far
afield
?
 
<EOS>
On
leaving
the
railway
,
I
travelled
for
two
days
in
a
sleigh
over
those
endless
snow
-
covered
roads
and
dark
forests
,
until
my
horses
,
with
their
jingling
bells
,
pulled
up
before
a
small
inn
on
the
outskirts
of
the
dismal
-
looking
town
of
Ostrog
.
<EOS>
The
place
,
with
its
roofs
covered
with
freshly
-
fallen
snow
,
lay
upon
the
slight
slope
of
a
low
hill
,
beneath
which
wound
the
Wilija
Goryn
,
now
frozen
so
hard
that
the
bridge
was
hardly
ever
used
.
<EOS>
It
was
January
,
and
that
month
in
Poland
is
always
a
cold
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
crossed
the
frontier
at
the
little
village
of
Kolodno
,
and
thence
driven
along
the
valleys
into
Volynien
,
a
long
,
weary
,
dispiriting
drive
,
on
and
on
until
those
bells
maddened
me
by
their
monotonous
rhythm
.
<EOS>
Cramped
and
cold
<EOS>
I
was
,
notwithstanding
the
big
fur
coat
<EOS>
I
wore
,
the
fur
cap
with
flaps
,
fur
gloves
,
and
fur
rug
.
<EOS>
The
country
inns
in
which
I
had
spent
the
past
two
nights
had
been
filthy
places
where
the
stoves
had
been
surrounded
by
evil
-
smelling
peasantry
,
where
the
food
was
uneatable
and
where
a
wooden
bench
had
served
me
as
a
bed
.
 
<EOS>
At
each
stage
where
we
changed
horses
the
post
-
house
keeper
had
held
up
his
hands
when
he
knew
my
destination
was
Ostrog
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Red
Rooster
"
was
crowing
there
,
they
said
significantly
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
true
.
<EOS>
Russia
was
under
the
Terror
again
,
and
in
no
place
in
the
whole
empire
were
the
revolutionists
so
determined
as
in
the
town
whither
I
was
bound
.
<EOS>
I
saw
at
once
the
reason
why
Hartmann
was
there
--
to
secretly
stir
up
strife
,
for
it
is
to
the
advantage
of
Germany
that
Russia
should
be
in
a
state
of
unrest
.
<EOS>
To
observe
the
German
methods
was
certainly
interesting
.
 
<EOS>
Ostrog
at
last
!
<EOS>
As
I
stood
up
and
descended
unsteadily
from
my
sleigh
my
eyes
fell
upon
something
upon
the
snow
near
the
door
of
the
inn
.
<EOS>
There
was
blood
.
<EOS>
It
told
its
own
tale
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
white
town
across
the
frozen
river
I
heard
revolver
shots
,
followed
by
a
loud
explosion
that
shook
the
whole
place
and
startled
the
three
horses
in
my
sleigh
.
 
<EOS>
Inside
the
long
,
low
,
common
room
of
the
inn
,
with
its
high
brick
stove
,
against
which
half
a
dozen
frightened
-
looking
men
and
women
were
huddled
,
I
asked
for
the
proprietor
,
whereupon
an
elderly
man
,
with
shaggy
hair
and
beard
,
came
forth
,
pulling
his
forelock
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
stay
here
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
your
excellency
,
"
was
the
old
fellow
's
reply
,
in
Polish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whatever
accommodation
my
poor
inn
can
afford
is
at
your
service"--and
<EOS>
he
at
once
shouted
orders
to
my
driver
to
bring
in
my
kit
,
while
the
women
,
all
of
them
flat
-
faced
peasants
,
made
room
for
me
at
the
stove
.
 
<EOS>
From
where
I
stood
I
could
hear
the
sound
of
desultory
firing
across
the
bridge
,
and
inquired
what
was
in
progress
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
an
ominous
silence
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
reply
,
for
,
as
I
afterwards
discovered
,
they
had
taken
me
for
a
high
police
official
from
Petersburg
,
thus
accounting
for
the
innkeeper
's
courtesy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
"
I
said
,
addressing
the
wrinkled
-
faced
old
Pole
,
"
what
is
happening
over
yonder
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
Cossacks
,
"
he
stammered
.
<EOS>
"
Krasiloff
and
his
Cossacks
are
upon
us
.
<EOS>
They
have
just
entered
the
town
and
are
shooting
down
people
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Hartmann
,
the
great
patriot
from
Germany
,
has
arrived
,
and
the
fight
for
freedom
has
commenced
,
excellency
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
horrible
.
<EOS>
A
poor
woman
was
shot
dead
before
my
door
half
an
hour
ago
,
and
her
body
taken
away
by
the
soldiers
.
"
 
<EOS>
Tired
as
I
was
,
I
lost
no
time
.
<EOS>
With
a
glance
to
see
that
my
own
revolver
was
loaded
,
I
threw
aside
my
overcoat
,
and
,
leaving
the
inn
,
walked
across
the
bridge
into
a
poor
narrow
street
of
wretched
-
looking
houses
,
many
of
them
built
of
wood
.
<EOS>
A
man
limped
slowly
past
me
,
wounded
in
the
leg
,
and
leaving
blood
-
spots
behind
him
as
he
went
.
<EOS>
An
old
woman
was
seated
in
a
doorway
,
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
,
wailing
:
 
"
<EOS>
My
poor
son!--dead!--dead
!
"
 
<EOS>
Before
me
I
saw
a
great
barricade
composed
of
trees
,
household
furniture
,
paving
-
stones
,
overturned
carts
,
pieces
of
barbed
wire
--
in
fact
,
everything
and
anything
the
populace
could
seize
upon
for
the
construction
of
hasty
defence
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
top
,
silhouetted
against
the
clear
frosty
sky
,
was
the
scarlet
flag
of
the
revolution
--
the
Red
Rooster
was
crowing
!
 
<EOS>
Excited
men
were
there
,
armed
with
rifles
,
shouting
and
giving
orders
.
<EOS>
Then
I
saw
that
a
small
space
had
been
left
open
against
the
wall
of
a
house
so
that
persons
might
pass
and
repass
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
approached
a
wild
-
haired
man
shouted
to
me
and
beckoned
frantically
.
<EOS>
I
grasped
his
meaning
.
<EOS>
He
wished
me
to
come
within
.
<EOS>
I
ran
forward
,
entered
the
town
proper
,
and
a
few
moments
later
the
opening
was
closed
by
a
dozen
slabs
of
stone
being
heaped
up
into
it
by
as
many
willing
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
I
found
myself
in
the
very
centre
of
the
revolution
,
behind
the
barricades
,
of
which
there
were
,
it
seemed
,
six
or
seven
.
<EOS>
From
the
rear
there
was
constant
firing
,
and
the
streets
in
the
vicinity
were
,
I
saw
to
my
horror
,
already
filled
with
dead
and
wounded
.
<EOS>
Women
were
wailing
over
husbands
,
lovers
,
brothers
;
men
over
their
daughters
and
wives
.
<EOS>
Even
children
of
tender
age
were
lying
helpless
and
wounded
,
some
of
them
shattered
and
dead
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
that
sight
was
sickening
.
<EOS>
Never
had
I
seen
wholesale
butchery
such
as
that
in
which
I
was
now
in
the
midst
.
<EOS>
I
was
looking
about
to
find
the
German
_
agent
provocateur
_
,
but
I
failed
to
find
him
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
having
bidden
the
people
to
rise
,
he
had
himself
escaped
.
<EOS>
Most
probably
.
 
<EOS>
Above
us
bullets
whistled
as
the
Cossacks
came
suddenly
round
a
side
street
and
made
a
desperate
attack
upon
the
barricade
I
had
entered
only
a
few
minutes
before
.
<EOS>
A
dozen
of
those
fighting
for
their
freedom
fell
back
dead
at
my
feet
at
the
first
volley
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
on
top
of
the
barricade
,
offering
a
mark
to
the
troops
of
the
Czar
.
<EOS>
Before
us
and
behind
us
there
was
firing
,
for
at
the
rear
of
us
was
another
barricade
.
<EOS>
We
were
,
in
fact
,
between
two
deadly
fires
.
 
<EOS>
Revolver
in
hand
,
I
stood
ready
to
defend
my
own
life
.
<EOS>
In
those
exciting
moments
I
disregarded
the
danger
I
ran
from
being
struck
in
that
veritable
hail
of
lead
.
<EOS>
Men
fell
wounded
all
around
me
,
and
there
was
blood
everywhere
.
<EOS>
A
thin
,
dark
-
headed
young
fellow
under
thirty
--
a
Moscow
student
,
I
subsequently
heard
--
seemed
to
be
the
ringleader
,
for
above
the
firing
could
be
heard
his
shouts
of
encouragement
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fight
!
<EOS>
my
comrades
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
standing
close
to
me
and
waving
the
red
flag
he
carried
--
the
emblem
of
the
Terror--"Down
with
the
Czar
!
<EOS>
Kill
the
vermin
he
sends
to
us
!
<EOS>
Long
live
Germany
!
<EOS>
Long
live
freedom
!
<EOS>
Kill
them

"
<EOS>
he
shrieked
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
killed
your
wives
and
daughters
.
<EOS>
Men
of
Ostrog
--
remember
your
duty
to

day

<EOS>
Set
an
example
to
Russia
.
<EOS>
Do
not
let
the
Moscow
fiasco
be
repeated
here
.
<EOS>
Fight
!
<EOS>
Fight
on
as
long
as
you
have
a
drop
of
life
-
blood
in
you
,
and
we
shall
win
,
we
shall
win

<EOS>
Down
with
the
Autocrat

<EOS>
Down
with

"
 
<EOS>
His
sentence
was
never
finished
,
for
at
that
instant
he
reeled
backwards
with
half
his
face
shot
away
by
a
Cossack
bullet
.
 
<EOS>
The
situation
was
,
for
me
,
one
of
greatest
peril
.
<EOS>
I
had
had
no
opportunity
of
finding
the
governor
of
the
town
to
present
my
credentials
,
and
thus
obtain
protection
.
<EOS>
The
whole
place
was
in
open
revolt
,
and
when
the
troops
broke
down
the
defences
,
as
I
saw
they
must
do
sooner
or
later
,
then
we
should
all
be
caught
in
a
trap
,
and
no
quarter
would
be
given
.
 
<EOS>
The
massacre
would
be
the
same
as
at
Moscow
and
many
other
towns
in
Western
Russia
,
wherein
the
populace
had
been
shot
down
indiscriminately
,
and
official
telegrams
had
been
sent
to
Petersburg
reporting
"
order
now
reigns
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
sought
shelter
in
a
doorway
,
but
scarcely
had
I
done
so
than
a
bullet
embedded
itself
in
the
woodwork
a
few
inches
from
my
head
.
<EOS>
At
the
barricade
the
women
were
helping
the
men
,
loading
their
rifles
for
them
,
shouting
and
encouraging
them
to
fight
gallantly
for
freedom
.
<EOS>
And
suddenly
I
caught
sight
of
Hartmann
's
evil
face
.
<EOS>
He
was
calmly
talking
to
a
man
who
was
no
doubt
also
in
the
German
employ
.
<EOS>
The
rising
was
their
work
!
 
<EOS>
A
yellow
-
haired
young
woman
,
not
more
than
twenty
,
emerged
from
a
house
close
by
where
I
stood
and
ran
past
me
to
the
barricade
.
<EOS>
As
she
passed
I
saw
that
she
carried
something
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
It
looked
like
a
small
cylinder
of
metal
.
 
<EOS>
Shouting
to
a
man
who
was
firing
through
a
loophole
near
the
top
of
the
barricade
,
she
handed
it
up
to
him
.
<EOS>
Taking
it
carefully
,
he
scrambled
up
higher
,
waited
for
a
few
moments
,
and
then
,
raising
himself
,
he
hurled
it
far
into
the
air
into
the
midst
of
an
advancing
troop
of
Cossacks
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
red
flash
,
a
terrific
explosion
which
shook
the
whole
town
,
wrecking
the
houses
in
the
immediate
vicinity
,
and
blowing
to
atoms
dozens
of
the
Czar
's
soldiers
.
 
<EOS>
A
wild
shout
of
victory
went
up
from
the
revolutionists
when
they
saw
the
havoc
caused
by
the
awful
bomb
.
<EOS>
The
yellow
-
haired
girl
returned
again
and
brought
another
,
which
,
after
some
ten
minutes
or
so
,
was
similarly
hurled
against
the
troops
,
with
equally
disastrous
effect
.
 
<EOS>
The
roadway
was
strewn
with
the
bodies
of
those
Cossacks
which
General
Kinski
,
the
governor
of
the
town
,
had
telegraphed
for
,
and
whom
Krasiloff
had
ordered
to
give
no
quarter
to
the
revolutionists
.
<EOS>
In
Western
Russia
the
name
of
Krasiloff
was
synonymous
with
all
that
was
cruel
and
brutal
.
<EOS>
It
was
he
who
ordered
the
flogging
of
the
five
young
women
at
Minsk
,
those
poor
unfortunate
creatures
who
were
knouted
by
Cossacks
who
laid
their
backs
bare
to
the
bone
.
<EOS>
As
every
one
in
Russia
knows
,
two
of
them
,
both
members
of
good
families
,
died
within
a
few
hours
,
and
yet
no
reprimand
did
he
receive
from
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
By
the
Czar
and
at
the
Ministry
of
the
Interior
he
was
known
to
be
a
hard
man
,
and
for
that
reason
certain
towns
where
the
revolutionary
spirit
was
strongest
had
been
given
into
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
At
Kiev
he
had
executed
without
trial
dozens
of
men
and
woman
arrested
for
revolutionary
acts
.
<EOS>
A
common
grave
was
dug
in
the
prison
yard
,
and
the
victims
,
four
at
a
time
,
were
led
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
pit
and
shot
,
each
batch
being
compelled
to
witness
the
execution
of
the
four
prisoners
preceding
them
.
<EOS>
With
a
refinement
of
cruelty
that
was
only
equalled
by
the
Inquisition
,
he
had
wrung
confessions
from
women
,
and
afterwards
had
them
shot
and
buried
.
<EOS>
At
Petersburg
they
knew
these
things
,
but
he
had
actually
been
commended
and
decorated
for
his
loyalty
to
the
Czar
!
 
<EOS>
And
now
that
he
had
been
hurriedly
moved
to
Ostrog
the
people
knew
that
his
order
to
the
Cossacks
was
to
massacre
the
people
,
and
more
especially
the
Jewish
portion
of
the
population
,
without
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Krasiloff
is
here
!
"
said
the
man
whose
face
was
smeared
with
blood
as
he
stood
by
me
.
"
<EOS>
He
intends
that
we
shall
all
die
,
but
we
will
fight
for
it
.
<EOS>
The
revolution
has
only
just
commenced
.
<EOS>
Soon
the
peasants
will
rise
,
and
we
will
sweep
the
country
clean
of
the
vermin
the
Czar
has
placed
upon
us
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
Kinski
,
the
governor
,
has
been
fired
at
twice
,
but
unsuccessfully
.
<EOS>
He
wants
a
bomb
,
and
he
shall
have
it
,
"
he
added
meaningly
.
<EOS>
"
Olga
--
the
girl
yonder
with
the
yellow
hair
--
has
one
for
him!"--and
he
laughed
grimly
.
 
<EOS>
I
recognised
my
own
deadly
peril
.
<EOS>
I
stood
revolver
in
hand
,
though
I
had
not
fired
a
shot
,
for
I
was
no
revolutionist
.
<EOS>
I
was
only
awaiting
the
inevitable
breaking
down
of
the
barricade
--
and
the
awful
catastrophe
that
must
befall
the
town
when
those
Cossacks
,
drunk
with
the
lust
for
blood
,
swept
into
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
Around
me
men
and
women
were
shouting
themselves
hoarse
,
while
the
red
emblem
of
Terror
still
waved
lazily
from
the
top
of
the
barricade
.
<EOS>
The
men
manning
the
improvised
defence
kept
up
a
withering
fire
upon
the
troops
,
who
in
the
open
road
were
afforded
no
cover
.
<EOS>
Time
after
time
the
place
shook
as
those
terrible
bombs
exploded
with
awful
result
,
for
the
yellow
-
haired
girl
seemed
to
keep
up
a
continuous
supply
of
them
.
<EOS>
They
were
only
seven
or
eight
inches
long
,
but
hurled
into
a
company
of
soldiers
their
effect
was
deadly
.
 
<EOS>
For
half
an
hour
longer
it
seemed
as
though
the
defence
of
the
town
would
be
effectual
,
yet
,
of
a
sudden
,
the
redoubled
shouts
of
those
about
me
told
me
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
The
Cossacks
had
been
reinforced
,
and
were
about
to
rush
the
barricade
.
 
<EOS>
I
managed
to
peer
forth
,
and
there
,
surely
enough
,
the
whole
roadway
was
filled
with
soldiers
.
 
<EOS>
Yells
,
curses
,
heavy
firing
,
men
falling
back
from
the
barricade
to
die
around
me
,
and
<EOS>
the
disappearance
of
the
red
flag
showed
that
the
Cossacks
were
at
last
scaling
the
great
pile
of
miscellaneous
objects
that
blocked
the
street
.
<EOS>
A
dozen
of
the
Czar
's
soldiers
appeared
silhouetted
against
the
sky
as
they
scrambled
across
the
top
of
the
barricade
,
but
the
next
second
a
dozen
corpses
fell
to
earth
,
riddled
by
the
bullets
of
the
men
standing
below
in
readiness
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
moment
,
however
,
others
appeared
in
their
places
,
and
still
more
and
more
.
<EOS>
Women
threw
up
their
hands
in
despair
and
fled
for
their
lives
,
while
men
--
calmly
prepared
to
die
in
the
cause
--
shouted
again
and
again
,
"
Down
with
Krasiloff
and
the
Czar
!
<EOS>
Long
live
the
revolution
!
<EOS>
Long
live
Germany
!
<EOS>
Give
us
the
Kaiser
!
<EOS>
Victory
for
the
people
's
will
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
stood
undecided
.
<EOS>
I
was
facing
death
.
<EOS>
Those
Cossacks
with
orders
to
massacre
would
give
no
quarter
,
and
would
not
discriminate
.
<EOS>
Krasiloff
was
waiting
for
his
dastardly
order
to
be
carried
out
.
<EOS>
The
Czar
had
given
him
instructions
to
crush
the
revolution
by
whatever
means
he
thought
proper
.
 
<EOS>
Those
moments
of
suspense
seemed
hours
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
there
was
another
flash
,
a
stunning
report
,
the
air
was
filled
with
debris
,
and
a
great
breach
opened
in
the
barricade
.
<EOS>
The
Cossacks
had
used
explosives
to
clear
away
the
obstruction
.
<EOS>
Next
instant
they
were
upon
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
flew
--
flew
for
my
life
.
<EOS>
Whither
my
legs
carried
me
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
Women
's
despairing
shrieks
rent
the
air
on
every
hand
.
<EOS>
The
massacre
had
commenced
.
<EOS>
I
remember
I
dashed
into
a
long
,
narrow
street
that
seemed
half
deserted
,
then
turned
corner
after
corner
,
but
behind
me
,
ever
increasing
,
rose
the
cries
of
the
doomed
populace
.
<EOS>
The
Cossacks
were
following
the
people
into
their
houses
and
killing
men
,
women
,
and
even
children
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
as
I
turned
into
a
side
street
,
I
saw
that
it
led
into
a
large
open
thoroughfare
,
the
main
road
through
the
town
,
I
expect
.
<EOS>
And
there
,
straight
before
me
,
I
saw
that
an
awful
scene
was
being
enacted
.
 
<EOS>
I
turned
to
run
back
,
but
at
that
instant
a
woman
's
long
,
despairing
cry
reached
me
,
causing
me
to
glance
within
a
doorway
,
where
stood
a
big
,
brutal
Cossack
,
who
had
pursued
and
captured
a
pretty
,
dark
-
haired
,
well
-
dressed
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
Save
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
shrieked
as
I
passed
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
save
me
,
sir
!
"
she
gasped
,
white
,
terrified
,
and
breathless
with
struggling
.
<EOS>
"
He
will
kill
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
burly
soldier
had
his
bearded
face
close
down
to
hers
,
his
arms
clasped
around
her
,
and
had
evidently
forced
her
from
the
street
into
the
entry
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
second
I
hesitated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sir
,
save
me
!
<EOS>
Save
me
,
and
God
will
reward
you
!
"
<EOS>
she
implored
,
her
big
,
dark
eyes
turned
to
mine
in
final
appeal
.
 
<EOS>
The
fellow
at
that
moment
raised
his
fist
and
struck
her
a
brutal
blow
upon
the
mouth
that
caused
the
blood
to
flow
,
saying
with
a
savage
growl
:
 
<EOS>
"
Be
quiet
,
will
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
that
woman
go
!
"
<EOS>
I
commanded
in
the
best
Russian
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
,
with
a
glare
in
his
fiery
eyes
,
for
the
blood
-
lust
was
within
him
,
he
turned
upon
me
and
sneeringly
asked
who
I
was
to
give
him
orders
,
while
the
poor
girl
reeled
,
half
stunned
by
his
blow
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
her
go
<EOS>
I
say
!
<EOS>
"
I
shouted
,
advancing
quickly
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
a
moment
he
had
drawn
his
big
army
revolver
,
and
,
ere
<EOS>
I
became
aware
of
his
dastardly
intention
,
he
raised
it
to
a
few
inches
from
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
Quick
<EOS>
as
thought
I
raised
my
own
weapon
,
which
I
had
held
behind
me
,
and
<EOS>
,
being
accredited
a
fairly
good
shot
,
I
fired
in
an
endeavour
to
save
the
poor
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Fortunately
my
bullet
struck
,
for
he
stepped
back
,
his
revolver
dropped
from
his
fingers
upon
the
stones
,
and
,
stumbling
forward
,
he
fell
dead
at
her
feet
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
My
shot
had
,
I
saw
,
hit
him
in
the
temple
,
and
death
had
probably
been
instantaneous
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
cry
of
joy
at
her
sudden
release
,
the
girl
rushed
across
to
me
,
and
raising
my
left
hand
to
her
lips
,
kissed
it
,
at
the
same
time
thanking
me
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
for
the
first
time
,
I
recognised
how
uncommonly
pretty
she
was
.
<EOS>
Not
more
than
eighteen
<EOS>
,
she
was
slim
and
petite
,
with
a
narrow
waist
and
graceful
figure
--
quite
unlike
in
refinement
and
in
dress
<EOS>
the
other
women
I
had
seen
in
Ostrog
.
<EOS>
Her
dark
hair
had
come
unbound
in
her
desperate
struggle
with
the
Cossack
and
hung
about
her
shoulders
,
her
bodice
was
torn
and
revealed
a
bare
white
neck
,
and
her
chest
heaved
and
fell
as
in
breathless
,
disjointed
sentences
she
thanked
me
again
and
again
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
second
to
lose
,
however
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
I
recognised
,
a
Jewess
,
and
Krasiloff
's
orders
were
not
to
spare
them
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
main
street
beyond
rose
the
shouts
and
screams
,
the
firing
and
wild
triumphant
yells
as
the
terrible
massacre
progressed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
with
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
breathlessly
.
<EOS>
"
Along
here
.
<EOS>
I
know
of
a
place
of
safety
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
led
the
way
,
running
swiftly
for
about
two
hundred
yards
,
and
then
,
turning
into
a
narrow
,
dirty
courtyard
,
passed
through
an
evil
,
forbidding
-
looking
house
,
where
all
was
silent
as
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
key
she
quickly
opened
the
door
of
a
poor
,
ill
-
furnished
room
,
which
she
closed
behind
her
,
but
did
not
lock
.
<EOS>
Then
,
opening
a
door
on
the
opposite
side
,
which
had
been
papered
over
so
as
to
escape
observation
,
I
saw
there
was
a
flight
of
damp
stone
stairs
leading
down
to
a
cellar
or
some
subterranean
regions
beneath
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
Down
here
!
"
she
said
,
taking
a
candle
,
lighting
it
,
and
handing
it
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
Go
--
I
will
follow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
descended
cautiously
into
the
cold
,
dank
place
,
discovering
it
to
be
a
kind
of
unlighted
cellar
hewn
out
of
the
rock
.
<EOS>
A
table
,
a
chair
,
a
lamp
,
and
some
provisions
showed
that
preparation
had
been
made
for
concealment
there
,
but
ere
I
had
entirely
explored
the
place
my
pretty
fellow
-
fugitive
rejoined
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
,
I
hope
,
is
a
place
of
safety
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
They
will
not
find
us
here
.
<EOS>
This
is
where
Gustave
lived
before
his
flight
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Gustave
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
,
looking
her
straight
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
She
dropped
her
eyes
and
blushed
.
<EOS>
Her
silence
told
its
own
tale
.
<EOS>
The
previous
occupant
of
that
rock
chamber
was
her
lover
.
 
<EOS>
Her
name
was
Luba
--
Luba
Lazareff
,
she
told
me
.
<EOS>
But
of
herself
she
would
tell
me
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
Her
reticence
was
curious
,
yet
before
long
I
recognised
the
reason
of
her
refusal
.
 
<EOS>
In
reply
to
further
questions
she
said
:
"
The
Germans
are
our
friends
.
<EOS>
Two
men
from
Berlin
have
been
in
Ostrog
nearly
a
month
holding
secret
meetings
and
urging
us
to
rise
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
Hermann
Hartmann
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
He
is
the
great
patriot
.
<EOS>
He
arrived
here
the
day
before
yesterday
to
address
us
before
the
struggle
,
"
she
replied
enthusiastically
.
 
<EOS>
Candle
in
hand
<EOS>
,
I
was
examining
the
deepest
recesses
of
the
dark
,
cavernous
place
,
while
she
lit
the
lamp
,
when
,
to
my
surprise
,
I
discovered
at
the
further
end
a
workman
's
bench
,
upon
which
were
various
pieces
of
turned
metal
,
pieces
of
tube
of
various
sizes
,
and
little
phials
of
glass
like
those
used
for
the
tiny
tabloids
for
subcutaneous
injections
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
one
up
to
examine
it
,
but
at
that
instant
she
noticed
me
and
screamed
in
terror
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
sir
!
<EOS>
For
heaven
's
sake
,
put
that
down
--
very
carefully
.
<EOS>
Touch
nothing
there
,
or
we
may
both
be
blown
to
pieces
!
<EOS>
See
!
"
<EOS>
she
added
in
a
low
,
intense
voice
of
confession
,
as
she
,
dashed
forward
,
"
there
are
finished
bombs
there
!
<EOS>
Gustave
could
not
carry
them
all
away
,
so
he
left
those
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
Gustave
made
these
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
And
,
see
,
he
gave
me
this"--and
she
drew
from
her
breast
a
small
,
shining
cylinder
of
brass
,
a
beautifully
finished
little
object
about
four
inches
long
similar
to
those
used
at
the
barricade
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
gave
this
to
me
to
use
--
if
necessary
!
"
<EOS>
the
girl
added
,
a
meaning
flash
in
her
dark
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
moment
I
was
silent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
would
have
used
it
upon
that
Cossack
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
slowly
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
was
my
intention
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
kill
yourself
,
as
well
as
your
assailant
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
promised
him
,
"
was
her
simple
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
this
Gustave
?
<EOS>
You
love
him
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
all
about
him
.
<EOS>
Remember
I
am
your
friend
,
and
will
help
you
if
I
can
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
hesitated
,
and
I
was
compelled
to
urge
her
again
and
again
ere
she
would
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
he
is
German
--
from
Berlin
,
"
she
said
at
last
,
as
we
still
stood
before
the
bomb
-
maker
's
bench
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
a
chemist
,
and
,
being
an
anarchist
,
came
to
us
,
and
joined
us
in
the
Revolution
.
<EOS>
The
petards
thrown
over
the
barricades
to
-
day
were
of
his
make
,
but
he
had
to
fly
.
<EOS>
He
left
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
Berlin
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
How
can
I
tell
?
<EOS>
The
Cossacks
may
have
caught
and
killed
him
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
dead
,
"
she
added
hoarsely
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
direction
has
he
taken
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
compelled
to
leave
hurriedly
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
He
came
,
kissed
me
,
and
gave
me
this
,
"
she
said
,
still
holding
the
shining
little
bomb
in
her
small
white
hand
.
"
<EOS>
He
said
he
intended
,
if
possible
,
to
get
over
the
hills
to
the
frontier
at
Satanow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
saw
that
she
was
deeply
in
love
with
the
fugitive
,
whoever
he
might
be
.
 
<EOS>
Outside
the
awful
massacre
was
in
progress
,
we
knew
;
but
no
sound
of
it
reached
us
down
in
that
rock
-
hewn
tomb
.
 
<EOS>
The
yellow
candle
-
light
fell
upon
her
sweet
dimpled
face
,
but
when
she
turned
her
splendid
eyes
to
mine
I
saw
that
in
them
was
a
look
of
anxiety
and
terror
inexpressible
.
 
<EOS>
I
inquired
of
her
father
and
mother
,
for
she
was
of
a
superior
class
,
as
I
had
from
the
first
moment
detected
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
French
extremely
well
,
and
we
had
dropped
into
that
language
as
being
easier
for
me
than
Russian
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
can
it
matter
to
you
,
sir
,
a
stranger
?
<EOS>
"
she
sighed
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
interested
in
you
,
mademoiselle
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Had
I
not
been
I
should
not
have
fired
that
shot
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
yes
!
"
she
cried
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
an
ingrate
!
<EOS>
You
saved
my
life,"--and
<EOS>
again
she
seized
both
my
hands
and
kissed
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
,
startled
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
for
I
distinctly
heard
a
sound
of
crackling
wood
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
moment
men
's
gruff
voices
reached
us
from
above
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Cossacks
!
<EOS>
"
she
screamed
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
found
us
--
they
have
found
us
!
"
<EOS>
And
the
light
died
out
of
her
beautiful
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
In
her
trembling
hand
she
held
the
terrible
little
engine
of
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
quick
movement
I
gripped
her
wrist
,
urging
her
to
refrain
until
all
hope
was
abandoned
,
and
together
we
stood
facing
the
soldiers
as
they
descended
the
stairs
to
where
we
were
.
<EOS>
They
were
,
it
seems
,
searching
every
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
they
cried
,
"
a
good
hiding
-
place
this
!
<EOS>
But
the
wall
was
hollow
,
and
revealed
the
door
!
"
<EOS>
and
next
moment
we
saw
the
figures
of
men
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
pretty
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
a
big
,
leering
Cossack
,
chucking
the
trembling
girl
beneath
the
chin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
"
<EOS>
I
commanded
the
half
-
dozen
men
who
now
stood
before
us
,
their
swords
red
with
the
life
-
blood
of
the
Revolution
.
<EOS>
But
before
I
could
utter
further
word
the
poor
girl
was
wrenched
from
my
grasp
,
and
the
Cossack
was
smothering
her
face
with
his
hot
nauseous
kisses
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
,
I
tell
you
!
"
<EOS>
I
shouted
.
<EOS>
"
Release
her
,
or
it
is
at
your
own
peril
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hulloa
!
"
they
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you?"--and
one
of
the
men
raised
his
sword
to
strike
me
,
whilst
another
held
him
back
,
exclaiming
,
"
Let
us
hear
what
he
has
to
say
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
listen
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
,
drawing
from
my
pocket
book
a
folded
paper
.
"
<EOS>
Read
this
,
and
look
well
at
the
signature
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
British
subject
,
and
this
girl
is
under
my
protection!"--and
<EOS>
I
handed
to
the
man
who
held
little
Luba
in
his
arms
my
permit
to
travel
hither
and
thither
in
Russia
,
which
the
Ambassador
in
London
had
signed
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
,
astounded
at
my
announcement
,
read
the
document
beneath
the
lamp
-
light
and
took
counsel
among
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
who
,
pray
,
is
this
Jewess
?
"
inquired
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
affianced
wife
,
"
was
my
quick
reply
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
command
you
at
once
to
take
us
under
safe
conduct
to
General
Krasiloff
--
quickly
,
without
delay
.
<EOS>
We
took
refuge
in
this
place
from
the
Revolution
,
in
which
we
have
taken
no
part
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
saw
,
however
,
with
sinking
heart
,
that
one
of
the
men
was
examining
the
bomb
-
maker
's
bench
,
and
had
recognised
the
character
of
what
remained
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
us
,
smiled
grimly
,
and
whispered
something
to
one
of
his
companions
.
 
<EOS>
Again
in
an
authoritative
tone
I
demanded
to
be
taken
to
Krasiloff
,
and
presently
,
after
being
marched
as
prisoners
across
the
town
,
past
scenes
so
horrible
that
they
are
still
vividly
before
my
eyes
,
we
were
taken
into
the
chief
police
-
office
,
where
the
hated
official
,
a
fat
red
-
faced
man
in
a
general
's
uniform
--
the
man
without
pity
or
remorse
,
the
murderer
of
women
and
children
--
was
sitting
at
a
table
.
<EOS>
He
greeted
me
with
a
grunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
General
,
"
I
said
,
addressing
him
,
"
I
have
to
present
to
you
this
order
of
your
Ambassador
,
and
to
demand
safe
conduct
.
<EOS>
Your
soldiers
found
me
and
my----
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
hesitated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
pretty
Jewess
--
eh?"--and
a
smile
of
sarcasm
spread
over
his
fat
face
.
<EOS>
"
Well
,
go
on"--and
he
took
the
paper
I
handed
him
,
knitting
his
brows
again
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
British
royal
arms
and
the
visa
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
were
found
in
a
cellar
where
we
had
hidden
from
the
revolt
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
place
has
been
used
for
the
manufacture
of
bombs
,
"
declared
one
of
the
Cossacks
.
 
<EOS>
The
General
looked
my
pretty
companion
straight
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
name
,
girl
?
"
he
demanded
roughly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Luba
Lazareff
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Native
of
where
?
"
 
"
Of
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
doing
in
Ostrog
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
with
me
,
"
I
interposed
.
<EOS>
"
I
demand
protection
for
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
addressing
the
prisoner
,
sir
,
"
was
his
cold
remark
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
refuse
to
obey
the
order
of
the
Emperor
's
representative
in
London
!
<EOS>
Good
!
<EOS>
Then
I
shall
report
you
to
the
Minister
,
"
I
exclaimed
,
piqued
at
his
insolence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
,
girl
!
"
<EOS>
he
roared
,
his
black
eyes
fixed
fiercely
upon
her
.
<EOS>
"
Why
are
you
in
Ostrog
?
<EOS>
You
are
no
provincial
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
my
affianced
wife
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
in
face
of
my
statement
and
my
passport
she
need
make
no
reply
to
any
of
your
questions
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
short
,
stout
little
man
,
shabbily
dressed
,
pushed
his
way
forward
to
the
table
,
saying
:
 
"
Luba
Lazareff
is
a
well
-
known
revolutionist
,
your
Excellency
.
<EOS>
The
German
maker
of
bombs
,
Gustave
Englebach
,
is
her
lover
--
not
this
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Gustave
only
left
Ostrog
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
speaker
was
,
I
afterwards
discovered
,
one
of
Hartmann
's
agents
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
where
is
Englebach
now
?
<EOS>
I
gave
orders
for
his
arrest
some
days
ago
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
found
this
morning
by
the
patrol
on
the
road
to
Schumsk
,
recognised
,
and
shot
,
your
Excellency
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
poor
little
Luba
gave
vent
to
a
piercing
scream
and
burst
into
a
torrent
of
bitter
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
fiends
!
<EOS>
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
shot
my
Gustave
!
<EOS>
He
is
dead--_dead
!
<EOS>
_
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
doubt
,
I
suppose
,
as
to
his
identity
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
General
.
 
<EOS>
"
None
,
your
Excellency
.
<EOS>
Some
papers
found
upon
the
body
have
been
forwarded
to
us
with
the
report
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
let
the
girl
be
shot
also
.
<EOS>
She
aided
him
in
the
manufacture
of
the
bombs
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Shot
!
"
<EOS>
I
gasped
,
utterly
staggered
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
General
?
<EOS>
You
will
shoot
a
poor
defenceless
girl
,
and
in
face
of
my
demand
for
her
protection
.
<EOS>
I
have
promised
her
marriage
,
"
I
cried
in
desperation
,
"
and
you
condemn
her
to
execution
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
Emperor
has
given
me
orders
to
quell
the
rebellion
,
and
all
who
make
bombs
for
use
against
the
Government
must
die
.
<EOS>
His
Majesty
gave
me
orders
to
execute
all
such
,
"
said
the
official
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
You
,
sir
,
will
have
safe
conduct
to
whatever
place
you
wish
to
visit
.
<EOS>
Take
the
girl
away
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
General
,
reflect
a
moment
whether
this
is
not----
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
reflect
,
sir
,
"
he
cried
angrily
,
and
rising
from
his
chair
with
outstretched
hand
,
he
snapped
:
 
"
How
much
of
my
time
are
you
going
to
lose
over
the
wench
?
<EOS>
Take
her
away
,
and
let
it
be
done
at
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
poor
condemned
girl
,
blanched
to
the
lips
and
trembling
from
head
to
foot
,
turned
quickly
to
me
,
and
in
a
few
words
in
French
thanked
me
,
and
again
kissed
my
hand
,
with
the
brief
words
,
"
Farewell
;
you
have
done
your
best
.
<EOS>
God
will
reward
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
,
with
one
accord
,
we
all
turned
,
and
together
went
mournfully
forth
into
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
A
lump
arose
in
my
throat
,
for
I
saw
,
as
the
General
pointed
out
,
that
my
passport
did
not
extend
beyond
my
own
person
.
<EOS>
Luba
was
a
Russian
subject
,
and
therefore
under
the
Russian
martial
law
.
 
<EOS>
Of
a
sudden
,
however
,
just
as
we
emerged
into
the
roadway
,
the
unfortunate
girl
,
at
whose
side
I
still
remained
,
turned
and
,
raising
her
tearful
face
to
mine
,
kissed
me
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
before
any
of
us
were
aware
of
her
intention
,
she
again
turned
,
wrenched
herself
free
,
and
rushed
back
into
the
room
where
the
General
was
still
sitting
.
 
<EOS>
The
Cossacks
dashed
after
her
,
but
ere
<EOS>
they
reached
the
chamber
<EOS>
there
was
a
terrific
explosion
,
the
air
was
filled
with
debris
,
the
back
of
the
building
was
torn
completely
out
,
and
when
a
few
minutes
later
I
summoned
courage
to
enter
and
peep
within
the
wrecked
room
,
I
saw
a
scene
that
I
dare
not
describe
here
in
cold
print
.
 
<EOS>
Suffice
<EOS>
it
to
say
that
the
bodies
of
Luba
and
General
Stepan
Krasiloff
were
unrecognisable
,
save
for
the
shreds
of
clothing
that
still
remained
.
 
<EOS>
Luba
had
used
her
bomb
in
revenge
for
Gustave
's
death
,
and
she
had
freed
Russia
of
the
heartless
tyrant
who
had
condemned
her
to
die
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
man
Hartmann
--
the
German
"
patriot
,
"
whose
underlings
had
stirred
up
the
revolt
--
was
already
on
his
way
back
to
Berlin
.
 
<EOS>
As
in
France
and
Russia
,
so
also
in
England
,
German
Secret
agents
are
,
we
have
discovered
,
at
work
stirring
strife
in
many
directions
.
 
<EOS>
One
is
a
dastardly
scheme
,
by
which
,
immediately
before
a
dash
is
made
upon
our
shores
,
a
great
railway
strike
is
to
be
organised
,
ostensibly
by
the
socialists
,
in
order
to
further
paralyse
our
trade
and
render
us
in
various
ways
unable
to
resist
the
triumphant
entry
of
the
foe
.
 
<EOS>
When
"
the
Day
"
comes
,
this
plot
of
our
friends
across
the
North
Sea
will
assuredly
be
revealed
,
just
as
the
truth
was
revealed
to
me
at
Ostrog
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XIII
 
<EOS>
OUR
WIRELESS
SECRETS
  
<EOS>
Something
important
was
being
attempted
,
but
what
it
was
neither
Ray
Raymond
nor
myself
could
make
out
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
exerted
a
good
deal
of
vigilance
and
kept
constant
watch
upon
Hartmann
's
house
in
Pont
Street
since
my
return
from
Poland
,
but
all
to
no
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Vera
had
been
staying
in
London
with
her
aunt
and
had
greatly
assisted
us
in
keeping
observation
upon
two
strangers
who
had
arrived
in
London
about
a
month
ago
,
and
who
were
staying
in
an
obscure
hotel
near
Victoria
Station
.
 
<EOS>
Their
names
were
Paul
Dubois
,
a
Belgian
,
and
Frederick
Gessner
,
a
German
.
<EOS>
The
first
-
named
was
,
we
judged
,
about
forty
,
stout
,
flabby
-
faced
,
wearing
gold
pince
-
<EOS>
nez
,
while
the
German
was
somewhat
younger
,
both
quiet
,
studious
-
looking
men
who
seemed
,
however
,
to
be
welcomed
by
many
of
the
prominent
members
of
the
German
colony
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
On
five
separate
occasions
we
had
followed
the
pair
to
King
's
Cross
Station
and
watched
them
take
third
class
tickets
to
Hull
.
<EOS>
They
would
remain
there
perhaps
two
or
three
days
,
and
then
return
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
while
they
had
grown
tired
of
their
hotel
,
and
had
taken
a
small
furnished
house
at
the
top
of
Sydenham
Hill
,
close
to
the
Crystal
Palace
,
a
pleasant
little
place
with
a
small
secluded
garden
in
which
were
several
high
old
elms
.
<EOS>
They
engaged
a
rather
obese
old
Frenchwoman
as
housekeeper
,
and
there
they
led
a
quiet
life
,
engrossed
apparently
in
literary
studies
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
that
when
it
came
my
turn
to
watch
them
I
became
more
than
ever
convinced
that
Raymond
's
suspicions
were
ungrounded
.
<EOS>
They
seldom
went
out
,
and
when
they
did
,
it
was
either
to
dine
with
Hartmann
,
or
to
stroll
about
the
suburban
roads
of
Norwood
,
Sydenham
,
and
Penge
.
 
<EOS>
Late
one
afternoon
,
however
,
while
I
was
down
at
Sydenham
,
I
saw
them
emerge
from
the
house
,
carrying
their
small
suit
-
cases
,
and
followed
them
to
King
's
Cross
Station
,
where
they
took
tickets
for
Hull
.
 
<EOS>
Instantly
I
rushed
to
the
telephone
and
informed
Ray
in
Bruton
Street
of
my
intention
to
follow
them
.
 
<EOS>
That
same
night
I
found
myself
in
the
smoke
-
grimed
Station
Hotel
in
Hull
,
where
the
two
foreigners
had
also
put
up
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
they
called
at
a
solicitor
's
office
at
the
end
of
Whitefriargate
,
and
thence
,
accompanied
by
a
man
who
was
apparently
the
lawyer
's
managing
clerk
,
they
went
in
a
cab
along
the
Docks
,
where
,
at
a
spot
close
to
the
Queen
's
Dock
,
they
pulled
up
before
an
empty
factory
,
a
place
which
was
not
very
large
,
but
which
possessed
a
very
high
chimney
.
 
<EOS>
The
managing
clerk
entered
the
premises
with
a
key
,
and
for
about
half
an
hour
the
pair
were
within
,
apparently
inspecting
everything
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
puzzled
.
<EOS>
Why
they
were
in
treaty
to
rent
a
place
of
this
description
was
an
utter
enigma
.
 
<EOS>
They
returned
to
the
hotel
to
luncheon
,
and
I
watched
them
engaged
in
animated
discussion
afterwards
,
and
I
also
noticed
that
they
despatched
a
telegram
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
they
called
upon
the
solicitor
,
and
by
their
satisfied
manner
when
they
came
forth
from
the
office
,
I
guessed
that
they
had
become
tenants
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
I
was
not
mistaken
,
for
that
same
afternoon
they
went
together
to
the
factory
and
let
themselves
in
with
the
key
,
remaining
within
for
over
an
hour
,
evidently
planning
something
.
 
<EOS>
That
night
I
wrote
a
long
report
to
Raymond
,
and
next
morning
spoke
to
him
over
the
telephone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Vera
wants
to
know
if
you
want
her
in
Hull
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
she
'll
come
,
"
my
friend
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
just
as
puzzled
as
you
are
.
<EOS>
Those
two
men
mean
mischief
--
but
in
what
manner
is
a
mystery
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
Miss
Vallance
can
come
,
I
'll
be
only
too
thankful
,
"
<EOS>
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
fear
the
men
know
you
,
but
they
do
n't
know
her
.
<EOS>
And
she
can
greatly
assist
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
Jacox
,
"
was
his
reply
.
<EOS>
"
She
'll
leave
this
evening
.
<EOS>
She
'll
wire
to
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
She
'd
better
not
be
seen
with
you
.
<EOS>
So
,
to
the
hotel
people
,
you
'll
be
strangers
.
<EOS>
Meet
outside
,
and
arrange
matters
.
'
<EOS>
Phone
me
when
you
want
me
up
there
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Right
,
old
chap
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
ring
you
up
at
eleven
to
-
morrow
and
report
.
<EOS>
So
be
in
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
I
rang
off
.
 
<EOS>
Vera
arrived
just
before
eleven
that
evening
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
the
hall
of
the
hotel
when
the
porter
entered
,
carrying
her
dressing
-
case
.
<EOS>
She
passed
me
and
went
to
the
office
,
but
I
did
not
acknowledge
her
.
<EOS>
She
wore
a
neat
dark
blue
travelling
gown
,
well
cut
by
her
tailor
,
and
a
little
toque
which
suited
her
face
admirably
.
<EOS>
She
possessed
perfect
taste
in
dress
.
 
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
later
I
sent
a
note
up
to
her
room
by
a
waiter
,
asking
her
to
meet
me
outside
on
the
railway
platform
at
ten
o'clock
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
She
kept
the
appointment
,
and
in
order
to
escape
observation
we
entered
the
refreshment
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
numbers
of
the
rooms
occupied
by
the
two
men
are
sixty
-
eight
and
seventy
-
two
,
"
I
explained
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
will
be
as
well
if
you
watch
them
<EOS>
the
whole
of
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
They
are
at
present
in
the
writing
-
room
,
so
you
can
at
once
pick
them
up
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
Mr.
Jacox
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Jack
is
intensely
anxious
.
<EOS>
He
's
very
puzzled
as
to
what
they
intend
doing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
replied
,
"
it
's
quite
a
mystery
.
<EOS>
But
we
shall
discover
something
ere
long
,
never
fear
.
"
 
<EOS>
Vera
laughed
as
she
sipped
the
glass
of
milk
I
had
ordered
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
briefly
explained
all
that
I
had
discovered
,
telling
her
how
the
two
men
had
evidently
taken
the
factory
on
a
lease
,
and
how
they
were
there
every
day
,
apparently
making
plans
for
future
business
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
what
business
do
they
intend
starting
?
"
she
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
;
"
that
's
what
we
have
to
find
out
.
<EOS>
And
we
shall
do
so
before
very
long
,
if
we
are
careful
and
vigilant
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Trust
me
,
"
she
said
;
"
I
am
entirely
at
your
orders
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
shall
wait
and
hear
your
report
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
When
you
return
to
the
hotel
send
a
line
to
my
room
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
that
arrangement
we
parted
.
 
<EOS>
That
day
I
spent
idling
in
the
vicinity
of
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
It
was
mid
-
August
,
and
the
atmosphere
was
stifling
.
<EOS>
That
district
of
Hull
is
not
a
very
pleasant
one
,
for
it
is
one
of
mean
provincial
streets
and
of
the
noise
of
railway
lorries
rumbling
over
the
granite
setts
.
 
<EOS>
The
afternoon
I
spent
in
playing
billiards
with
the
marker
,
when
about
six
o'clock
a
page
-
boy
brought
me
a
note
from
my
enthusiastic
little
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
in
the
station
refreshment
-
room
at
half
-
past
six
.
<EOS>
Meet
me.--VERA
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Those
were
the
words
I
found
within
the
envelope
.
 
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
later
,
when
I
sat
at
the
little
marble
-
topped
table
with
her
,
she
related
how
she
had
been
following
the
pair
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
were
in
the
factory
from
half
-
past
one
until
four
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
They
've
ordered
a
builder
to
put
up
ladders
to
examine
the
chimney
.
<EOS>
They
appear
to
think
it
is
n't
quite
safe
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
told
me
the
name
of
the
builder
,
adding
that
the
contract
was
to
have
the
ladders
in
position
during
the
next
three
days
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
leaving
for
London
to
-
night
by
the
last
train
,
"
she
added
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
the
Belgian
telling
the
hall
-
porter
as
I
came
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
we
'll
wire
to
Ray
to
meet
them
,
and
keep
an
eye
upon
them
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
will
go
up
to
town
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
And
when
they
return
I
will
follow
them
down
if
Ray
deems
it
best
,
"
replied
the
pretty
girl
,
who
was
just
as
enthusiastic
in
her
patriotism
as
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
So
still
mystified
I
was
compelled
to
remain
inactive
in
Hull
,
while
Vera
and
the
two
foreigners
whom
we
suspected
of
espionage
went
up
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
next
four
days
I
heard
nothing
until
suddenly
,
at
eight
o'clock
one
morning
,
Ray
entered
my
bedroom
before
I
was
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
found
out
one
thing
about
those
Johnnies
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
They
've
been
buying
,
in
Clerkenwell
,
a
whole
lot
of
electrical
appliances
--
coils
of
wire
,
insulators
,
and
batteries
.
<EOS>
Some
of
it
has
been
sent
direct
to
the
place
they
've
taken
here
,
and
the
rest
has
been
sent
to
their
house
down
in
Sydenham
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
can
they
want
that
for
?
<EOS>
"
I
queried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
know
,
my
dear
chap
.
<EOS>
Let
's
wait
and
see
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
after
all
,
they
are
about
to
set
up
in
business
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Neither
of
them
has
struck
me
as
being
spies
.
<EOS>
Save
that
they
've
visited
Hartmann
once
or
twice
,
their
movements
have
not
been
very
suspicious
.
<EOS>
Many
foreigners
are
setting
up
factories
in
England
,
owing
to
the
recent
change
in
our
patent
laws
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
said
my
friend
.
"
<EOS>
Yet
their
confidential
negotiations
with
Hartmann
have
aroused
my
suspicions
,
and
I
feel
confident
we
shall
discover
something
interesting
before
long
.
<EOS>
They
came
back
by
the
same
train
as
I
travelled
.
"
 
<EOS>
After
breakfast
,
we
both
strolled
round
to
the
factory
.
<EOS>
The
ground
it
covered
was
not
much
,
and
it
was
surrounded
by
a
wall
about
twelve
feet
high
,
so
that
no
one
could
see
within
the
courtyard
.
<EOS>
It
had
,
at
one
time
,
been
a
lead
-
mill
,
but
for
the
past
eight
years
had
,
we
learned
,
been
untenanted
.
 
<EOS>
Even
as
we
loitered
near
,
we
saw
the
builder
's
men
bringing
long
ladders
for
the
inspection
of
the
chimney
.
 
<EOS>
We
watched
for
a
whole
week
,
but
as
each
day
passed
,
I
became
more
confident
that
we
were
upon
a
false
scent
.
 
<EOS>
The
chimney
had
been
inspected
,
the
ladders
taken
down
again
,
and
once
more
the
German
and
the
Belgian
had
returned
south
to
that
pleasant
London
suburb
.
 
<EOS>
In
order
to
ascertain
what
was
really
in
progress
I
called
one
morning
upon
the
solicitor
in
Whitefriargate
,
on
pretext
of
being
a
likely
tenant
of
the
factory
.
<EOS>
I
was
,
however
,
informed
by
the
managing
clerk
that
it
was
already
let
to
a
firm
of
electrical
engineers
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
the
purchase
of
electrical
appliances
was
entirely
accounted
for
.
 
<EOS>
Once
again
I
returned
to
London
.
<EOS>
They
seemed
,
by
the
electrical
accessories
that
had
been
delivered
,
to
be
fitting
up
a
second
factory
in
their
house
in
Sydenham
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
being
a
private
house
,
seemed
somewhat
mysterious
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
become
friendly
also
with
a
tall
,
rather
well
-
dressed
Englishman
named
Fowler
,
who
had
the
appearance
of
a
superior
clerk
,
and
who
resided
in
a
rather
nice
house
in
Hopton
Road
,
Streatham
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
Fowler
had
become
a
frequent
visitor
at
their
house
,
while
,
on
several
occasions
,
he
dined
with
Dubois
at
De
Keyser
's
Hotel
,
facing
Blackfriars
Bridge
.
 
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
some
conversation
<EOS>
I
one
evening
overheard
--
a
conversation
in
English
,
which
the
Belgian
spoke
fluently
<EOS>
--
I
judged
Fowler
to
be
an
electrician
,
and
it
seemed
,
later
on
,
very
much
as
though
he
had
been
,
or
was
about
to
be
,
taken
into
partnership
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
As
far
as
we
could
discover
,
however
,
he
had
been
told
nothing
about
the
factory
in
Hull
.
<EOS>
More
than
once
I
suspected
that
the
two
foreigners
were
swindlers
,
who
intended
to
"
do
"
the
Englishman
out
of
his
money
.
<EOS>
This
was
impressed
I
upon
me
the
more
,
because
one
evening
a
German
woman
was
introduced
to
their
newly
-
found
friend
as
Frau
Gessner
,
who
had
just
arrived
from
Wiesbaden
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
she
was
really
Gessner
's
wife
I
doubted
.
<EOS>
It
was
curious
that
,
on
keeping
observation
that
evening
,
I
found
that
the
lady
did
not
reside
at
Sydenham
,
but
at
a
small
hotel
in
Bloomsbury
,
not
a
stone's
-
throw
from
my
own
rooms
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
certainly
some
deep
game
in
progress
.
<EOS>
What
could
it
be
?
 
<EOS>
Vera
had
watched
Fowler
on
several
occasions
,
but
beyond
the
fact
that
he
was
an
electrical
engineer
,
occupying
a
responsible
position
with
a
well
-
known
telegraph
construction
company
,
we
could
discover
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
After
nearly
three
weeks
in
London
,
Dubois
and
Gessner
returned
to
Hull
,
where
,
while
living
at
the
Station
Hotel
,
they
spent
each
day
at
their
"
works
.
"
<EOS>
They
engaged
no
assistant
,
and
were
bent
apparently
upon
doing
everything
by
themselves
.
<EOS>
They
were
joined
one
day
by
a
shrivelled
-
up
old
man
of
rather
seedy
appearance
,
and
typically
German
.
<EOS>
His
name
was
Busch
,
and
he
lived
in
lodgings
out
on
the
Beverley
Road
.
<EOS>
He
was
taken
to
the
works
,
and
remained
there
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
A
quantity
of
electrical
appliances
were
delivered
from
London
,
and
Dubois
and
Gessner
received
them
and
unpacked
them
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
Raymond
was
down
at
Sheerness
upon
another
matter
--
a
serious
attempt
to
obtain
some
confidential
naval
information
--
therefore
I
remained
in
Hull
anxiously
watching
.
<EOS>
Vera
had
again
offered
her
services
,
but
at
that
moment
she
was
down
at
Sheerness
with
Ray
.
 
<EOS>
Day
by
day
old
Busch
went
regularly
to
the
factory
,
and
by
the
appearance
of
the
trio
when
they
came
forth
,
it
was
apparent
that
they
worked
very
hard
.
<EOS>
I
was
intensely
inquisitive
,
and
dearly
wished
to
obtain
a
glance
within
the
place
.
<EOS>
But
that
was
quite
out
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
Busch
,
it
seemed
,
had
lived
in
Hull
for
a
considerable
period
.
<EOS>
Inquiries
of
his
neighbours
revealed
that
he
was
a
well
-
known
figure
.
<EOS>
He
did
but
little
work
,
preferring
to
take
long
walks
into
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
One
man
told
me
that
he
had
met
him
twice
away
near
Spurn
Head
,
at
the
estuary
of
the
Humber
,
and
on
another
occasion
he
had
seen
him
wandering
aimlessly
along
the
low
-
lying
coast
in
the
vicinity
of
Hornsea
.
<EOS>
In
explanation
of
this
,
it
seemed
that
he
had
once
lived
for
a
whole
summer
in
Withernsea
,
not
far
from
Spurn
Head
,
and
had
grown
fond
of
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
Everybody
looked
upon
him
as
a
harmless
old
man
,
a
trifle
eccentric
,
and
a
great
walker
.
 
<EOS>
That
constant
rambling
over
that
low
-
lying
district
of
Holderness
had
aroused
my
suspicions
,
and
I
determined
to
turn
my
attention
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
One
day
the
old
man
did
not
go
to
the
factory
,
but
instead
went
forth
upon
one
of
his
rambles
.
<EOS>
He
took
train
from
Hull
to
Hornsea
,
where
the
railway
ends
at
the
sea
,
and
walked
along
the
shore
for
several
miles
;
indeed
until
he
was
three
parts
of
the
distance
to
Bridlington
,
when
he
suddenly
halted
near
the
little
village
of
Barmston
,
and
producing
a
neat
pocket
-
camera
took
a
long
series
of
snap
-
shots
of
the
flat
coast
,
where
I
saw
there
were
several
places
which
would
afford
an
easy
landing
for
the
invader
.
 
<EOS>
The
truth
was
in
an
instant
plain
.
<EOS>
Old
Busch
was
a
"
fixed
-
agent
,
"
who
was
carrying
on
the
same
work
along
the
Yorkshire
coast
as
his
ingenious
compatriots
were
doing
in
Norfolk
,
Suffolk
,
and
Essex
.
<EOS>
The
remainder
of
that
day
I
kept
a
sharp
eye
upon
him
,
and
witnessed
him
making
many
notes
and
taking
many
photographs
of
the
various
farms
and
houses
near
the
sea
.
<EOS>
He
noted
the
number
of
haystacks
in
the
farmyards
--
for
his
report
on
fodder
stores
,
no
doubt
--
and
made
certain
notes
regarding
the
houses
,
of
great
use
,
no
doubt
,
when
the
Germans
came
to
billet
their
troops
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
nearly
midnight
that
I
was
back
at
the
hotel
in
Hull
.
<EOS>
Then
,
by
judicious
inquiry
of
the
hall
porter
--
who
had
become
my
particular
friend
--
I
ascertained
that
Gessner
had
left
for
London
by
the
last
train
.
 
<EOS>
Should
I
follow
,
or
should
I
remain
in
Hull
?
 
<EOS>
I
decided
upon
the
latter
course
,
and
retired
to
bed
,
thoroughly
fagged
out
.
 
<EOS>
Early
next
morning
I
went
round
to
the
telephone
-
exchange
,
rather
than
use
the
instrument
in
the
hotel
,
and
rang
up
Raymond
.
 
<EOS>
To
my
delight
he
answered
my
call
.
<EOS>
He
was
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
gave
him
a
rapid
digest
of
what
I
had
discovered
,
and
told
him
that
the
German
had
returned
to
Sydenham
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
old
chap
,
"
came
his
voice
over
the
wire
.
<EOS>
"
Vera
will
watch
at
this
end
,
while
you
watch
yours
.
<EOS>
If
what
I
guess
is
right
,
they
're
doing
something
far
more
serious
than
surveying
that
flat
coast
north
of
the
Humber
.
<EOS>
Be
careful
not
to
betray
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Trust
me
for
that
,
"
I
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
back
to
Sheerness
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
'll
be
there
all
day
to
-
day
--
and
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
hope
to
get
one
of
our
friends
the
enemy
arrested
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
'm
trying
for
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
--
and
good
luck
,
"
<EOS>
and
he
rang
off
.
 
<EOS>
Busch
went
to
the
factory
where
Dubois
was
already
awaiting
him
.
<EOS>
As
I
stood
outside
that
building
of
mystery
I
wondered
what
devilment
was
being
plotted
within
.
<EOS>
It
had
not
been
cleaned
or
painted
,
the
windows
being
still
thick
with
soot
,
and
several
of
them
,
which
had
been
broken
,
were
boarded
up
.
<EOS>
The
place
had
certainly
not
been
cleaned
down
for
years
,
and
no
wonder
they
had
been
suspicious
of
the
stability
of
that
chimney
which
towered
so
high
towards
the
murky
sky
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
sign
whatever
of
activity
within
,
or
of
any
business
about
to
be
carried
on
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
day
followed
day
,
Busch
and
Dubois
spending
most
of
their
time
within
those
high
walls
which
held
their
secret
.
 
<EOS>
One
curious
thing
was
the
number
of
telegrams
delivered
there
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
they
sent
and
received
as
many
as
fourteen
or
fifteen
in
a
day
.
<EOS>
How
I
longed
to
know
with
whom
they
were
in
such
constant
communication
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
after
the
third
day
,
the
shoal
of
wires
entirely
ceased
.
<EOS>
Busch
and
Dubois
,
instead
of
going
to
the
factory
,
spent
the
day
in
the
country
,
taking
train
to
Patrington
and
walking
through
Skeffling
went
out
to
Kilnsea
,
opposite
Great
Grimsby
at
the
entrance
to
the
Humber
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
point
where
I
watched
I
could
see
that
the
old
man
with
considerable
gesticulation
was
standing
upon
the
shore
facing
seaward
and
explaining
something
to
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
The
Belgian
apparently
put
many
questions
to
him
,
and
had
become
intensely
interested
.
<EOS>
Then
presently
his
companion
produced
a
paper
from
his
pocket
--
evidently
a
plan
,
for
he
pointed
out
something
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
lit
their
pipes
,
and
sitting
down
upon
a
rock
discussed
something
quietly
.
<EOS>
Apparently
Busch
was
making
an
elaborate
explanation
,
now
and
then
pointing
with
his
finger
seaward
.
 
<EOS>
Where
he
pointed
was
the
channel
through
which
passed
all
the
shipping
into
the
Humber
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
after
a
time
,
he
rose
from
where
he
sat
,
and
seemed
to
be
measuring
a
distance
by
taking
paces
,
his
companion
walking
at
his
side
over
the
level
expanse
of
sand
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
halted
,
pointing
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Dubois
examined
the
shore
at
that
point
with
apparent
curiosity
.
<EOS>
With
what
object
I
could
not
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
They
remained
there
for
fully
an
hour
,
and
the
sun
had
already
set
when
they
returned
to
Patrington
,
and
took
the
train
back
to
Hull
.
 
<EOS>
That
old
Busch
was
a
spy
I
had
proved
long
ago
,
but
what
part
Dubois
and
Gessner
were
playing
was
not
yet
at
all
clear
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
following
evening
,
about
ten
o'clock
,
I
saw
Dubois
near
the
Dock
office
,
and
on
watching
him
,
followed
him
to
the
factory
,
which
he
entered
with
his
key
.
<EOS>
Beyond
the
gate
was
the
small
paved
courtyard
in
which
rose
the
high
chimney
.
<EOS>
Within
the
factory
he
lit
the
gas
,
for
I
could
see
its
reflection
,
though
from
the
street
I
could
not
get
sight
of
the
lower
windows
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
was
bright
and
moonlit
,
and
as
I
waited
I
heard
within
the
grinding
of
a
windlass
,
and
saw
to
my
surprise
,
a
thin
light
iron
rod
about
six
feet
long
and
placed
vertically
rising
slowly
up
the
side
of
the
chimney
stack
,
evidently
being
drawn
up
to
a
pulley
at
its
summit
.
 
<EOS>
Dubois
was
hoisting
it
to
the
top
,
where
at
last
<EOS>
it
remained
stationary
,
its
ends
just
protruding
beneath
the
coping
and
hardly
visible
.
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
this
been
done
when
Busch
came
along
,
and
I
had
to
exercise
a
quick
movement
to
avoid
detection
.
<EOS>
He
was
admitted
by
Dubois
,
and
the
door
was
closed
and
locked
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
I
stood
beneath
the
wall
,
trying
to
overhear
their
words
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
understand
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
a
dull
,
crackling
noise
broke
the
silence
of
the
night
,
as
though
the
sound
was
dulled
by
a
padded
room
.
 
<EOS>
Again
I
listened
.
<EOS>
Then
at
last
the
truth
dawned
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
spies
had
put
in
a
secret
installation
of
wireless
telegraphy
!
 
<EOS>
Those
intermittent
sounds
were
that
of
the
Morse
code
.
<EOS>
They
were
exchanging
signals
with
some
other
persons
.
 
<EOS>
Gessner
was
absent
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
the
corresponding
station
was
at
that
house
high
upon
Sydenham
Hill
to
the
south
of
London
,
two
hundred
miles
distant
!
 
<EOS>
I
waited
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
listening
to
those
secret
signals
.
<EOS>
Then
I
hurried
to
the
telephone
,
and
fortunately
found
Raymond
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
what
I
had
discovered
,
and
urged
him
to
take
a
taxi
at
once
down
to
Sydenham
and
ascertain
whether
they
were
receiving
signals
there
.
 
<EOS>
This
he
promised
to
do
,
telling
me
he
would
'
phone
me
the
result
to
the
hotel
at
eight
o'clock
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
returned
to
the
factory
,
and
through
the
long
night
-
hours
listened
to
their
secret
experiments
.
 
<EOS>
At
eight
next
morning
the
telephone
rang
,
and
Ray
briefly
explained
that
Gessner
,
who
had
placed
his
apparatus
upon
the
high
flagstaff
in
his
garden
,
had
been
receiving
messages
all
night
!
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
seen
anything
of
Fowler
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
But
Hartmann
has
spent
the
night
with
Gessner
,
apparently
watching
his
experiments
.
<EOS>
Could
n't
you
manage
to
watch
your
opportunity
and
get
inside
the
factory
somehow
?
<EOS>
I
'll
come
north
at
noon
,
and
we
'll
see
what
we
can
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
five
o'clock
he
stepped
from
the
London
express
,
and
together
we
walked
down
to
the
Imperial
Hotel
,
to
which
I
had
suddenly
changed
my
quarters
,
feeling
that
I
had
been
too
long
in
the
close
vicinity
of
the
spy
Dubois
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
seems
that
they
carry
out
their
experiments
at
night
,
"
I
explained
.
"
<EOS>
For
in
the
daytime
the
wireless
apparatus
is
no
longer
in
position
.
<EOS>
I
see
now
why
they
engaged
a
builder
to
examine
the
chimney
--
in
order
to
place
a
pulley
with
a
wire
rope
in
position
at
the
top
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
Gessner
and
Dubois
are
expert
electricians
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
Members
of
the
Telegraphen
-
Abtheilung
of
the
German
army
,
most
probably
,
"
remarked
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
who
is
Fowler
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
victim
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
He
appears
to
be
a
most
respectable
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
any
financial
difficulty
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
that
I
can
discover
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
why
have
they
established
this
secret
communication
between
Hull
and
London
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
just
what
we
have
to
discover
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
laughed
Ray
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
we
are
to
get
a
peep
inside
the
place
it
's
evident
we
can
only
do
so
in
the
daytime
.
<EOS>
At
night
they
are
down
there
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
early
morning
,
"
I
suggested
,
"
after
they
have
left
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
he
said
;
"
we
'll
watch
them
to
-
night
,
and
get
in
after
they
leave
.
<EOS>
I
've
brought
a
few
necessaries
in
my
bag
--
the
set
of
housebreaking
implements
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
grin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
I
said
,
"
neither
of
us
know
much
about
wireless
telegraphy
.
<EOS>
Could
n't
we
get
hold
of
an
operator
from
one
of
the
Wilson
liners
in
dock
,
and
take
him
along
with
us
?
<EOS>
A
sailor
is
always
an
adventurer
.
"
 
<EOS>
Ray
was
struck
with
the
idea
,
and
by
eight
o'clock
that
evening
we
had
enlisted
the
services
of
a
smart
young
fellow
,
one
of
the
operators
in
the
Wilson
American
service
,
to
whom
,
in
strictest
confidence
,
we
related
our
suspicions
.
 
<EOS>
That
night
proved
an
exciting
one
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
for
us
it
was
cloudy
,
with
rain
,
at
intervals
.
<EOS>
Murphy
,
the
wireless
operator
,
listening
under
the
wall
declared
that
we
were
not
mistaken
.
<EOS>
The
men
were
sending
messages
in
code
.
 
<EOS>
"
Most
probably
,
"
he
said
,
"
they
have
another
station
across
at
Borkum
,
Wilhelmshaven
,
or
somewhere
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
they
're
at
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
much
puzzled
.
 
<EOS>
Through
those
long
hours
we
watched
anxiously
;
but
just
before
the
dawn
Dubois
and
Busch
lowered
their
apparatus
from
the
top
of
the
chimney
,
and
a
few
minutes
later
emerged
,
walking
together
towards
the
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
were
out
of
sight
we
held
a
consultation
,
and
it
was
decided
that
,
while
Murphy
and
I
kept
watch
for
the
police
,
Ray
should
use
his
jemmy
upon
the
door
and
break
it
open
.
<EOS>
He
would
admit
us
and
remain
himself
outside
to
give
us
warning
.
 
<EOS>
Those
moments
were
breathless
ones
.
 
<EOS>
We
parted
,
the
wireless
operator
walking
one
way
,
while
I
went
in
the
opposite
direction
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
we
heard
the
cracking
of
wood
,
followed
by
a
low
cough
.
 
<EOS>
By
that
,
we
knew
all
was
well
.
 
<EOS>
We
hurried
back
,
and
a
few
seconds
later
were
in
the
courtyard
of
the
disused
factory
.
<EOS>
Ray
had
handed
me
his
jemmy
,
and
with
it
I
broke
open
the
second
door
of
the
empty
place
,
flashing
a
light
with
the
electric
torch
I
carried
.
 
<EOS>
We
passed
into
the
small
office
,
but
no
second
glance
was
needed
to
show
that
the
place
was
completely
fitted
with
a
wireless
installation
of
the
most
approved
pattern
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
'll
try
it
,
"
suggested
young
Murphy
,
and
taking
out
the
apparatus
we
hauled
it
up
to
the
top
of
the
chimney
.
<EOS>
Then
re
-
entering
the
office
,
he
placed
the
receiver
over
his
ears
,
and
listened
intently
,
in
his
hand
a
pencil
he
had
found
ready
upon
the
paper
pad
.
 
<EOS>
I
stood
watching
his
face
.
<EOS>
Apparently
he
heard
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
touched
the
key
of
the
instrument
and
instantly
a
great
blue
spark
,
causing
a
crackling
noise
,
flashed
across
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
calling
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
his
face
brightened
,
and
he
was
listening
.
<EOS>
Then
he
grew
greatly
puzzled
.
 
<EOS>
Taking
the
receiver
off
his
head
he
began
to
search
the
table
upon
which
were
several
books
;
but
at
that
instant
I
heard
a
light
footstep
behind
me
,
and
as
I
turned
I
felt
a
heavy
crushing
blow
upon
the
top
of
my
skull
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
blackness
of
unconsciousness
fell
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
no
more
till
,
on
opening
my
eyes
,
I
found
myself
lying
in
bed
with
a
nurse
bending
over
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
gazed
around
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
There
were
other
beds
in
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
a
hospital
with
my
head
tightly
bandaged
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
whole
day
and
night
I
lay
there
,
the
nurse
forbidding
me
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
Then
suddenly
there
entered
Ray
,
whose
arm
was
in
a
sling
,
accompanied
by
young
Murphy
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
spies
came
back
--
unexpectedly
,
and
went
for
me
before
I
could
raise
the
alarm
,
"
Raymond
explained
.
"
<EOS>
Dubois
hit
you
over
the
head
with
a
jemmy
,
and
by
Jove
!
<EOS>
it
's
a
mercy
you
were
n't
killed
.
<EOS>
He
's
cleared
out
of
the
country
,
however
,
fearing
a
charge
of
attempted
murder
.
<EOS>
I
've
informed
the
police
,
and
they
are
looking
for
both
him
and
Busch
,
as
well
as
Gessner
,
who
is
missing
from
Sydenham
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
but
why
had
they
established
these
two
wireless
stations
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Murphy
,
"
it
's
a
most
ingenious
piece
of
work
.
<EOS>
By
some
unknown
means
both
the
station
here
,
and
at
Sydenham
,
had
been
tuned
with
the
one
which
I
daresay
you
've
seen
stretched
across
the
top
of
the
new
Admiralty
,
in
Whitehall
,
hence
they
could
read
all
the
orders
given
to
the
Home
and
Channel
Fleets
and
the
reports
received
from
them
,
while
I
have
to
-
day
discovered
that
there
is
a
similar
secret
station
existing
somewhere
near
Borkum
also
in
tune
with
these
,
and
with
our
Admiralty
.
<EOS>
Therefore
the
Germans
are
aware
of
every
signal
sent
to
our
Fleet
!
<EOS>
The
station
at
Sydenham
was
only
temporary
,
but
the
one
here
was
evidently
devised
in
order
that
the
German
admiral
in
the
North
Sea
,
on
seizing
Hull
and
establishing
a
base
here
,
might
have
constant
knowledge
of
our
Admiralty
orders
and
the
whereabouts
of
our
ships
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
listening
I
was
surprised
at
the
code
,
but
the
truth
was
made
plain
by
the
discovery
of
a
complete
copy
of
the
British
naval
code
lying
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
By
means
of
this
,
the
spies
could
decipher
all
messages
to
and
from
our
ships
.
<EOS>
The
Civil
Lord
of
the
Admiralty
and
three
officials
have
arrived
in
Hull
,
and
I
have
been
with
them
down
at
the
factory
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
The
chief
wireless
engineer
declares
that
the
secret
of
the
exact
tuning
must
have
been
learnt
from
somebody
in
the
office
of
the
constructors
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
both
Ray
and
I
then
remembered
the
man
Fowler
,
who
had
,
as
we
afterwards
discovered
,
been
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
,
and
had
suddenly
gone
abroad
,
a
fact
which
was
sufficiently
instructive
for
our
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
I
was
well
enough
to
leave
the
hospital
,
and
I
guided
the
superintendent
of
the
Hull
police
and
two
detectives
to
Busch
's
house
,
where
,
on
searching
his
room
,
we
discovered
a
volume
of
plans
and
reports
of
defences
of
the
Humber
and
its
estuary
,
estimates
of
food
and
fodder
supplies
in
the
country
north
of
Hull
,
together
with
a
list
of
the
foreign
pilots
and
their
addresses
,
as
well
as
an
annotated
chart
of
the
river
,
showing
the
position
where
mines
would
be
sunk
at
the
river
's
mouth
on
the
alarm
of
invasion
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
,
perhaps
,
would
have
been
even
more
alarming
to
the
general
public
,
had
they
but
known
,
was
the
discovery
of
several
great
bundles
of
huge
posters
ready
prepared
for
posting
up
on
the
day
of
invasion
--
the
Proclamation
threatening
with
death
all
who
dared
to
oppose
the
German
landing
and
advance
--
a
copy
of
which
I
have
given
in
these
pages
.
 
<EOS>
It
shows
,
indeed
,
what
careful
preparation
our
enemies
are
now
making
,
just
as
the
installation
of
the
secret
wireless
showed
the
tactful
cunning
of
the
invader
.
 
<EOS>
For
our
exertions
,
Raymond
,
Murphy
,
and
myself
received
the
best
thanks
of
the
Lords
of
the
Admiralty
,
at
which
,
I
confess
,
we
were
all
three
much
gratified
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XIV
 
PLAYING
A
DESPERATE
GAME
  
<EOS>
On
the
20th
of
December
,
1908
,
it
rained
incessantly
in
London
,
and
well
I
recollect
it
.
<EOS>
After
lunch
I
sat
in
the
club
-
window
in
St.
James
's
Street
,
idly
watching
the
drenched
passers
-
by
,
many
of
them
people
who
were
up
from
the
country
to
do
their
Christmas
shopping
.
 
<EOS>
The
outlook
was
a
gloomy
one
;
particularly
so
for
myself
,
for
I
had
arranged
to
spend
Christmas
with
an
aunt
who
had
a
pretty
villa
among
the
olives
outside
Nice
,
but
that
morning
I
had
received
a
telegram
from
her
saying
that
she
was
very
unwell
and
asking
me
to
postpone
my
visit
.
 
<EOS>
The
club
was
practically
deserted
save
for
one
or
two
old
cronies
.
<EOS>
Every
one
had
gone
to
country
houses
,
Ray
was
spending
Christmas
with
Vera
's
father
at
Portsmouth
,
and
in
view
of
the
message
I
had
received
I
felt
dull
and
alone
.
<EOS>
It
is
astonishing
how
very
lonely
a
man
may
be
at
Christmas
in
our
great
London
,
even
though
at
other
times
he
may
possess
hosts
of
friends
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
received
fully
a
dozen
invitations
to
country
houses
,
all
of
which
I
had
declined
,
and
was
now
,
alas
!
<EOS>
stranded
,
without
hope
of
spending
"
A
Merry
Christmas
,
"
except
in
the
lonely
silence
of
my
own
bachelor
chambers
.
<EOS>
So
I
smoked
on
,
looking
forth
into
the
darkening
gloom
.
 
<EOS>
The
waiter
switched
on
the
light
in
the
great
smoking
-
room
at
last
,
and
then
drew
the
heavy
curtains
at
all
the
long
windows
,
shutting
out
the
dismal
scene
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
I
knew
,
a
hard
-
working
member
of
Parliament
,
entered
,
threw
himself
down
wearily
and
lit
a
cigar
.
<EOS>
Then
,
idler
that
I
was
,
I
began
to
gossip
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
going
up
to
Perthshire
by
the
11.45
from
Euston
that
night
,
he
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
spending
Christmas
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
know
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Probably
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
have
the
hump
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
he
remarked
,
with
a
laugh
,
and
then
I
confided
to
him
the
reason
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
about
six
o'clock
,
I
put
on
my
overcoat
and
left
the
club
.
<EOS>
The
rain
had
now
stopped
,
therefore
I
decided
to
walk
along
to
my
rooms
in
Guilford
Street
.
 
<EOS>
Hardly
had
I
turned
the
corner
into
Piccadilly
,
when
I
heard
a
voice
at
my
elbow
uttering
my
name
with
a
foreign
accent
.
 
<EOS>
Turning
quickly
,
I
saw
,
to
my
great
surprise
,
a
man
named
Engler
,
whom
I
had
known
in
Bremen
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
clerk
in
the
Deutsche
Bank
,
opposite
the
Liebfrauen
-
Kirche
,
and
popular
in
a
certain
circle
in
that
Hanseatic
city
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Meester
Jacox
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
in
broken
English
in
his
enthusiastic
way
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
frendt
.
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
who
would
have
thought
of
meeting
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
ve
-
ry
glad
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
been
in
London
since
three
days
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
shook
my
friend
's
hand
warmly
,
for
a
year
ago
,
when
I
had
spent
some
time
beside
the
Weser
watching
two
men
I
had
followed
from
London
,
we
had
been
extremely
friendly
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
that
I
was
on
my
way
to
my
rooms
,
and
invited
him
in
to
have
a
chat
.
 
<EOS>
He
gladly
accompanied
me
,
and
when
we
were
comfortably
seated
in
my
cosy
sitting
-
room
he
began
to
relate
to
me
all
the
latest
news
from
Bremen
and
of
several
of
my
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Otto
Engler
was
a
well
-
dressed
,
rather
elegant
man
of
forty
,
whose
fair
beard
was
well
trimmed
,
whose
eyes
were
full
of
fire
,
and
who
rather
prided
himself
upon
being
something
of
a
lady
-
killer
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
London
in
connection
with
an
important
financial
scheme
in
which
his
brother
and
a
German
merchant
in
London
,
named
Griesbach
,
were
interested
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
brother
Wilhelm
were
over
on
a
visit
to
the
merchant
,
who
,
he
told
me
,
had
offices
in
Coleman
Street
,
and
who
lived
in
Lonsdale
Road
,
Barnes
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
fortune
in
the
business
,
he
declared
,
which
was
the
discovery
of
a
new
alloy
,
lighter
than
aluminium
,
yet
with
twenty
times
the
rigidity
.
 
<EOS>
That
evening
we
dined
together
at
the
"
Trocadero
,
"
looked
in
at
the
Empire
,
and
returned
to
the
club
for
a
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
was
delighted
to
have
found
an
old
friend
just
when
I
was
in
deepest
despair
of
the
dullness
of
everything
,
and
of
Christmas
in
particular
.
 
<EOS>
Otto
Engler
had
one
failing
--
his
impudent
inquisitiveness
.
<EOS>
After
he
had
left
me
it
occurred
to
me
that
all
the
time
we
had
been
together
he
had
been
constantly
endeavouring
to
discover
my
recent
movements
,
where
I
had
visited
of
late
,
where
I
intended
spending
Christmas
,
and
my
subsequent
movements
.
 
<EOS>
Why
did
he
desire
to
know
all
these
particulars
?
<EOS>
He
was
a
busybody
,
I
knew
,
and
the
worst
gossip
in
the
whole
of
that
gossip
-
loving
city
on
the
Weser
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
attributed
his
inquisitiveness
to
his
natural
propensity
for
prying
into
other
people
's
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
my
dear
friend
,
"
he
had
said
as
he
gripped
my
hand
on
leaving
me
,
"
they
often
speak
of
you
in
Bremen
.
<EOS>
How
we
all
wish
you
were
back
again
with
us
of
an
evening
at
the
Wiener
Cafe
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
shall
never
go
back
,
"
I
said
briefly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Business
nowadays
keeps
me
in
London
,
as
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
--
I
know
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Remember
,
you
have
always
had
a
true
friend
in
Otto
Engler
--
and
you
always
will
,
I
trust
.
"
 
<EOS>
Then
he
had
entered
the
taxi
which
the
hall
-
porter
had
called
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Next
afternoon
he
called
upon
me
at
New
Stone
Buildings
,
as
we
had
arranged
.
<EOS>
Ray
Raymond
was
seated
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
introduced
him
,
and
we
spent
a
pleasant
hour
,
chatting
and
smoking
.
<EOS>
Ray
had
also
been
in
Bremen
,
and
the
two
men
had
,
they
found
,
many
mutual
friends
.
<EOS>
Then
,
when
he
had
left
,
Ray
declared
himself
charmed
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
different
to
the
usual
German
,
"
he
declared
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
of
the
popinjay
about
him
,
nothing
of
the
modern
military
fop
of
Berlin
or
Dresden
,
men
who
are
,
in
my
estimation
,
the
very
acme
of
bad
breeding
and
degenerate
idiocy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Engler
is
quite
a
good
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
he
's
found
me
.
<EOS>
I
expected
to
be
deadly
dull
this
Christmas
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
do
I
,
"
replied
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
a
wire
this
morning
from
the
Admiral
saying
he
is
down
with
influenza
,
and
the
Christmas
house
-
party
is
postponed
.
<EOS>
So
I
shall
stay
in
town
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
we
might
spend
Christmas
day
together
,
"
I
suggested
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
arranged
.
 
<EOS>
My
German
friend
Otto
saw
me
daily
.
<EOS>
I
was
introduced
to
his
brother
,
Wilhelm
,
a
tall
,
thin
,
rather
narrow
-
eyed
man
who
,
from
his
atrocious
German
,
I
judged
was
from
Dantzig
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
evening
in
the
Cafe
Royal
that
I
first
saw
Wilhelm
,
who
was
seated
playing
dominoes
with
a
rather
stout
,
middle
-
aged
man
in
gold
-
rimmed
spectacles
,
Heinrich
Griesbach
.
 
<EOS>
Both
men
expressed
delight
at
meeting
me
,
and
I
invited
the
trio
to
my
rooms
for
a
smoke
and
a
gossip
.
 
<EOS>
We
sat
until
nearly
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Griesbach
had
been
many
years
in
London
,
and
was
apparently
financing
the
scheme
of
the
brothers
Engler
,
a
scheme
which
,
on
the
face
of
it
,
seemed
a
very
sound
undertaking
.
 
<EOS>
All
three
were
thorough
-
going
cosmopolitans
,
cheery
,
easy
-
going
men
of
the
world
,
who
told
many
quaint
stories
which
caused
my
room
to
ring
with
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
was
Christmas
Eve
,
and
Griesbach
suddenly
suggested
that
if
I
had
nothing
better
to
do
he
would
be
delighted
if
I
would
join
their
party
at
dinner
on
Christmas
night
at
his
house
over
at
Barnes
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
regret
very
much
,
"
I
said
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
've
already
arranged
to
dine
with
my
friend
Raymond
,
who
shares
chambers
with
me
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
exclaimed
Otto
Engler
,
"
I
'm
sure
Herr
Griesbach
would
be
very
pleased
if
he
came
also
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
!
"
cried
the
German
merrily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
more
the
merrier
.
<EOS>
We
shall
dine
at
eight
,
and
we
'll
expect
you
both
.
<EOS>
I
'll
send
a
note
to
Mr.
Raymond
,
if
you
'll
give
me
his
address
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
gave
it
to
him
,
and
nothing
loath
to
spend
the
festival
in
such
jovial
company
,
I
accepted
.
 
<EOS>
I
entertained
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
by
their
hospitality
they
wished
to
enlist
my
aid
,
because
I
had
one
or
two
friends
in
the
City
who
might
,
perhaps
,
assist
them
materially
in
their
scheme
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
after
all
,
Otto
Engler
had
often
been
my
guest
in
Bremen
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
I
heard
on
the
telephone
from
Ray
that
he
would
go
down
to
Barnes
with
me
,
and
would
call
for
me
at
six
at
Guilford
Street
.
<EOS>
Curiously
enough
,
I
had
become
so
impressed
by
the
possibilities
of
the
new
alloy
about
to
be
exploited
with
British
capital
,
that
I
had
really
become
anxious
to
"
go
in
"
with
them
.
<EOS>
Ray
Raymond
,
too
,
was
much
interested
when
I
showed
him
the
specimen
of
the
new
metal
which
Engler
had
given
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
"
said
he
when
he
called
for
me
at
six
o'clock
on
Christmas
evening
,
"
I
was
about
town
a
lot
yesterday
<EOS>
and
I
'm
quite
certain
that
I
was
followed
by
a
foreigner
--
a
rather
big
man
wearing
gold
spectacles
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
"
<EOS>
I
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
be
followed
by
any
foreigner
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
nonsense
,
my
dear
Jacox
,
"
he
declared
.
<EOS>
"
The
fellow
kept
close
observation
on
me
all
yesterday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
When
I
got
back
to
Bruton
Street
,
I
looked
out
half
an
hour
afterwards
and
there
he
was
,
still
idling
outside
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Some
chap
who
wants
to
serve
you
with
a
writ
,
perhaps
!
<EOS>
"
I
laughed
grimly
.
"
<EOS>
A
neglected
tailor
's
bill
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
watching
with
some
evil
intent
,
I
'm
certain
.
<EOS>
I
expect
he
's
somewhere
near
,
even
now
,
"
he
added
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
!
<EOS>
"
I
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
You
seem
quite
nervy
over
it
!
<EOS>
Next
time
you
see
him
,
go
up
to
the
Johnnie
and
ask
him
what
the
dickens
he
wants
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Then
,
half
an
hour
later
,
I
put
on
my
hat
and
coat
,
and
together
we
took
a
taxi
past
Kensington
Church
and
Olympia
,
to
Hammersmith
Bridge
,
over
which
we
turned
off
to
the
right
in
Castelnau
,
into
a
long
ill
-
lit
thoroughfare
,
running
parallel
with
the
river
.
<EOS>
Bare
trees
lined
the
road
,
and
each
house
was
a
good
-
sized
one
,
standing
in
its
own
grounds
.
 
<EOS>
Before
one
of
these
,
hidden
from
the
road
by
a
high
wall
,
and
standing
back
a
good
distance
from
the
road
,
the
cab
pulled
up
,
and
,
alighting
,
we
opened
the
gate
,
and
passing
up
a
well
-
kept
drive
pulled
the
bell
.
 
<EOS>
Our
summons
was
answered
by
a
thin
,
rather
consumptive
-
looking
German
man
-
servant
,
who
took
our
coats
and
ceremoniously
ushered
us
into
a
big
well
-
furnished
drawing
-
room
,
where
Griesbach
and
his
two
friends
were
already
assembled
awaiting
us
.
<EOS>
All
were
smoking
cigarettes
,
which
showed
that
no
ladies
were
to
be
present
.
 
<EOS>
The
instant
Ray
entered
the
room
I
saw
that
he
gave
a
start
,
and
a
few
moments
later
he
seized
an
opportunity
to
whisper
to
me
that
the
man
who
had
so
persistently
followed
him
on
the
previous
day
was
none
other
than
our
host
Griesbach
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
worry
over
it
,
my
dear
old
fellow
,
"
I
urged
.
<EOS>
"
What
motive
would
he
have
?
<EOS>
He
did
n't
even
know
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
the
gossip
became
merry
in
that
room
<EOS>
so
seasonably
decorated
with
holly
,
while
Griesbach
assured
us
of
his
delight
in
having
us
as
his
guests
.
 
<EOS>
Dinner
was
served
in
the
adjoining
room
,
and
a
most
excellent
and
thoroughly
English
repast
it
was
.
<EOS>
Our
host
had
been
long
enough
in
England
,
he
told
us
,
to
appreciate
English
fare
,
hence
we
had
part
of
a
baron
of
beef
with
Christmas
pudding
afterwards
,
and
excellent
old
port
and
nuts
to
follow
.
 
<EOS>
Two
young
Germans
waited
at
table
,
and
the
party
was
as
merry
a
one
as
any
of
us
could
wish
.
<EOS>
Only
Ray
seemed
serious
and
preoccupied
.
<EOS>
He
was
suspicious
I
knew
--
but
of
what
?
 
<EOS>
I
now
openly
confess
that
I
pretended
a
gaiety
which
I
certainly
did
not
feel
,
for
after
Raymond
had
told
me
that
he
had
recognised
Griesbach
,
a
very
strange
thought
had
occurred
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
this
.
<EOS>
As
we
had
entered
the
garden
to
approach
the
house
,
I
felt
certain
that
I
had
caught
sight
of
the
figure
of
a
man
crouching
against
one
of
the
bushes
in
the
shadow
.
<EOS>
At
the
time
I
had
thought
nothing
of
it
,
so
eager
was
I
to
meet
my
friends
.
<EOS>
Yet
now
,
in
face
of
Ray
's
whispered
words
,
I
grew
very
suspicious
.
<EOS>
Why
had
that
man
been
lurking
there
?
 
<EOS>
When
the
cloth
had
been
cleared
and
dessert
laid
,
the
elder
of
the
two
servants
placed
upon
the
table
before
our
host
a
big
box
of
long
crackers
covered
with
dark
green
gelatine
and
embellished
with
gold
paper
.
 
<EOS>
"
These
are
German
bon
-
bons
,
"
remarked
Griesbach
,
his
grey
eyes
beaming
through
his
spectacles
.
<EOS>
"
I
get
them
each
Christmas
from
my
home
in
Stuttgart
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
conversation
had
again
turned
upon
the
splendid
investment
about
to
be
offered
to
the
British
public
,
<EOS>
whereupon
I
half
suggested
that
I
was
ready
to
go
into
the
affair
myself
.
<EOS>
Griesbach
jumped
at
the
idea
,
just
as
I
expected
,
and
handed
round
the
box
of
crackers
.
<EOS>
Each
of
us
took
one
,
in
celebration
of
Christmas
,
and
on
their
being
pulled
we
discovered
small
but
really
acceptable
articles
of
masculine
jewellery
within
.
<EOS>
My
"
surprise
"
was
a
pair
of
plain
gold
sleeve
-
links
,
worth
fully
three
or
four
pounds
,
while
Ray
,
with
whom
I
pulled
,
received
a
nice
turquoise
scarf
-
pin
,
an
incident
which
quite
reassured
him
.
 
<EOS>
Our
host
refused
to
take
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
declared
,
"
they
are
for
you
,
my
dear
fellows
--
all
for
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
again
the
box
was
passed
round
,
and
four
more
crackers
were
taken
.
<EOS>
That
time
Ray
's
bon
-
bon
contained
a
tiny
gold
match
-
box
,
while
within
mine
I
found
a
small
charm
in
the
form
of
a
gold
enamelled
doll
to
hang
upon
one
's
watch
-
chain
.
 
<EOS>
As
Ray
and
I
pulled
my
cracker
,
I
had
suddenly
raised
my
eyes
and
caught
sight
of
the
expression
upon
the
face
of
my
friend
Engler
.
<EOS>
It
struck
me
as
very
curious
.
<EOS>
His
sallow
cheeks
were
pale
,
and
his
dark
eyes
seemed
starting
out
of
his
head
with
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
our
genial
host
,
after
he
had
passed
the
box
for
the
third
time
,
first
to
his
two
compatriots
,
who
handed
the
remaining
two
bon
-
bons
across
the
table
to
us
,
"
you
have
each
a
final
bon
-
bon
.
<EOS>
In
one
of
them
there
will
be
found
a
twenty
-
mark
piece
--
our
German
custom
.
<EOS>
I
suggest
,
in
order
to
mark
this
festive
occasion
,
that
whoever
of
you
four
obtains
<EOS>
the
coin
shall
receive
,
free
of
any
obligation
,
five
shares
in
our
new
syndicate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
most
generous
proposal
!
<EOS>
"
declared
my
friend
Engler
,
a
sentiment
with
which
we
all
agreed
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
Germans
pulled
their
bon
-
bons
,
but
were
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
The
prize
--
certainly
a
prize
worth
winning
--
now
lay
between
Ray
and
myself
.
 
<EOS>
At
that
instant
,
however
,
Griesbach
rose
from
the
table
suddenly
,
saying
:
 
"
You
two
gentlemen
must
settle
between
yourselves
.
<EOS>
It
lies
between
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
before
we
were
aware
of
his
intention
he
had
passed
into
the
adjoining
room
,
followed
by
his
two
friends
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
I
laughed
to
Ray
when
we
were
alone
,
"
here
goes
.
<EOS>
Let
's
decide
it
!
"
<EOS>
And
we
both
gripped
the
long
green
-
and
-
gold
cracker
.
<EOS>
If
the
coin
were
within
,
then
I
should
receive
a
very
handsome
present
,
worth
a
little
later
on
,
perhaps
,
several
thousand
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
At
that
instant
,
however
,
we
were
both
startled
by
a
loud
smashing
of
glass
in
the
next
room
,
curses
in
German
and
loud
shouts
in
English
,
followed
by
the
dull
report
of
a
revolver
.
 
<EOS>
We
both
sprang
into
the
room
,
and
there
,
to
our
surprise
,
found
that
six
men
had
entered
through
the
broken
French
window
and
were
struggling
fiercely
with
our
host
and
his
friends
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
in
the
name
of
Fate
does
this
mean
?
<EOS>
"
I
cried
,
startled
and
amazed
at
that
sudden
termination
to
our
cosy
Christmas
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
Mr.
Raymond
,
"
answered
a
big
brown
-
bearded
man
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
me
--
Pelham
of
Scotland
Yard
!
<EOS>
Keep
an
eye
on
those
bon
-
bons
in
the
next
room
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
touch
them
at
peril
of
your
life
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
when
our
host
and
our
two
friends
had
been
secured
--
not
,
however
,
before
the
room
had
been
wrecked
in
a
most
desperate
struggle
--
Inspector
Pelham
came
forward
to
where
Ray
was
standing
with
me
,
and
said
:
 
"
<EOS>
My
God
,
Mr.
Raymond
!
<EOS>
You
two
have
had
a
very
narrow
escape
,
and
no
mistake
!
<EOS>
Where
are
those
bon
-
bons
?
"
 
<EOS>
We
took
him
into
the
dining
-
room
,
showed
him
the
remaining
two
,
and
told
him
we
had
been
about
to
pull
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
.
<EOS>
We
were
watching
you
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
Those
men
were
flying
from
the
house
when
they
ran
into
our
arms
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
they
are
a
dangerous
trio
whom
we
want
on
several
charges
.
<EOS>
In
addition
,
all
three
,
and
also
the
two
servants
,
are
ingenious
spies
in
the
service
of
the
German
General
Staff
.
<EOS>
They
've
been
busy
this
last
two
years
.
<EOS>
They
intended
to
wreak
upon
both
of
you
a
terrible
revenge
for
your
recent
exposures
of
the
German
system
of
espionage
in
England
and
your
constant
prosecution
of
their
spies
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Revenge
!
<EOS>
"
I
gasped
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
revenge
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
replied
the
detective
-
inspector
,
"
both
these
bon
-
bons
contain
powerful
bombs
,
and
had
you
pulled
either
of
them
<EOS>
you
'd
both
have
been
blown
to
atoms
.
<EOS>
That
was
their
dastardly
intention
.
<EOS>
But
fortunately
we
got
wind
of
it
,
and
were
in
time
to
watch
and
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
only
just
in
the
nick
of
time
,
too
!
"
gasped
Ray
,
pale
-
faced
at
thought
of
our
narrow
escape
.
<EOS>
"
I
somehow
felt
all
along
some
vague
presage
that
evil
was
intended
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
three
spies
were
conveyed
to
Barnes
police
-
station
in
cabs
,
and
that
was
the
last
we
ever
saw
of
them
.
<EOS>
The
Government
again
hushed
up
the
matter
in
order
to
avoid
international
complications
,
I
suppose
,
but
a
week
later
the
interesting
trio
were
deported
by
the
police
to
Hamburg
as
undesirable
aliens
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
-
day
,
with
Ray
Raymond
,
I
am
wondering
what
is
to
be
the
outcome
of
all
this
organised
espionage
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
What
will
happen
?
<EOS>
When
will
Germany
strike
?
 
<EOS>
WHO
KNOWS
?
    
<EOS>
THE
END
<EOS>
