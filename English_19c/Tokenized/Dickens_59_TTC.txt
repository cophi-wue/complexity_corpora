The
Period
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
best
of
times
<EOS>
,
it
was
the
worst
of
times
,
it
was
the
age
of
wisdom
,
it
was
the
age
of
foolishness
,
it
was
the
epoch
of
belief
,
it
was
the
epoch
of
incredulity
,
it
was
the
season
of
Light
,
it
was
the
season
of
Darkness
,
it
was
the
spring
of
hope
,
it
was
the
winter
of
despair
,
we
had
everything
before
us
,
we
had
nothing
before
us
,
we
were
all
going
direct
to
Heaven
,
we
were
all
going
direct
the
other
way
---
in
short
,
the
period
was
so
far
like
the
present
period
,
that
some
of
its
noisiest
authorities
insisted
on
its
being
received
,
for
good
or
for
evil
,
in
the
superlative
degree
of
comparison
only
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
a
king
with
a
large
jaw
and
a
queen
with
a
plain
face
,
on
the
throne
of
England
;
there
were
a
king
with
a
large
jaw
and
a
queen
with
a
fair
face
,
on
the
throne
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
In
both
countries
it
was
clearer
than
crystal
to
the
lords
of
the
State
preserves
of
loaves
and
fishes
,
that
things
in
general
were
settled
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
year
of
Our
Lord
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
seventy
-
five
.
 
<EOS>
Spiritual
revelations
were
conceded
to
England
at
that
favoured
period
,
as
at
this
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Southcott
had
recently
attained
her
five
-
and
-
twentieth
blessed
birthday
,
of
whom
a
prophetic
private
in
the
Life
Guards
had
heralded
the
sublime
appearance
by
announcing
that
arrangements
were
made
for
the
swallowing
up
of
London
and
Westminster
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
Cock
-
lane
ghost
had
been
laid
only
a
round
dozen
of
years
,
after
rapping
out
its
messages
,
as
the
spirits
of
this
very
year
last
past
(
supernaturally
deficient
in
originality
)
rapped
out
theirs
.
<EOS>
Mere
messages
in
the
earthly
order
of
events
had
lately
come
to
the
English
Crown
and
People
,
from
a
congress
of
British
subjects
in
America
:
 
<EOS>
which
,
strange
to
relate
,
have
proved
more
important
to
the
human
race
than
any
communications
yet
received
through
any
of
the
chickens
of
the
Cock
-
lane
brood
.
   
<EOS>
France
,
less
favoured
on
the
whole
as
to
matters
spiritual
than
her
sister
of
the
shield
and
trident
,
rolled
with
exceeding
smoothness
down
hill
,
making
paper
money
and
spending
it
.
 
<EOS>
Under
the
guidance
of
her
Christian
pastors
,
she
entertained
herself
,
besides
,
with
such
humane
achievements
as
sentencing
a
youth
to
have
his
hands
cut
off
,
his
tongue
torn
out
with
pincers
,
and
his
body
burned
alive
,
because
he
had
not
kneeled
down
in
the
rain
to
do
honour
to
a
dirty
procession
of
monks
which
passed
within
his
view
,
at
a
distance
of
some
fifty
or
sixty
yards
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
likely
enough
that
,
rooted
in
the
woods
of
France
and
Norway
,
there
were
growing
trees
,
when
that
sufferer
was
put
to
death
,
already
marked
by
the
Woodman
,
Fate
,
to
come
down
and
be
sawn
into
boards
,
to
make
a
certain
movable
framework
with
a
sack
and
a
knife
in
it
,
terrible
in
history
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
likely
enough
that
in
the
rough
outhouses
of
some
tillers
of
the
heavy
lands
adjacent
to
Paris
,
there
were
sheltered
from
the
weather
that
very
day
,
rude
carts
,
bespattered
with
rustic
mire
,
snuffed
about
by
pigs
,
and
roosted
in
by
poultry
,
which
the
Farmer
,
Death
,
had
already
set
apart
to
be
his
tumbrils
of
the
Revolution
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
Woodman
and
that
Farmer
,
though
they
work
unceasingly
,
work
silently
,
and
no
one
heard
them
as
they
went
about
with
muffled
tread
:
 
<EOS>
the
rather
,
forasmuch
as
to
entertain
any
suspicion
that
they
were
awake
,
was
to
be
atheistical
and
traitorous
.
   
<EOS>
In
England
,
there
was
scarcely
an
amount
of
order
and
protection
to
justify
much
national
boasting
.
 
<EOS>
Daring
burglaries
by
armed
men
,
and
highway
robberies
,
took
place
in
the
capital
itself
every
night
;
families
were
publicly
cautioned
not
to
go
out
of
town
without
removing
their
furniture
to
upholsterers
'
warehouses
for
security
;
the
highwayman
in
the
dark
was
a
City
tradesman
in
the
light
,
and
,
being
recognised
and
challenged
by
his
fellow
-
tradesman
whom
he
stopped
in
his
character
of
"
the
Captain
,
"
gallantly
shot
him
through
the
head
and
rode
away
;
the
mall
was
waylaid
by
seven
robbers
,
and
the
guard
shot
three
dead
,
and
then
got
shot
dead
himself
by
the
other
four
,
"
in
consequence
of
the
failure
of
his
ammunition
:
"
after
which
the
mall
was
robbed
in
peace
;
that
magnificent
potentate
,
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
,
was
made
to
stand
and
deliver
on
Turnham
Green
,
by
one
highwayman
,
who
despoiled
the
illustrious
creature
in
sight
of
all
his
retinue
;
prisoners
in
London
gaols
fought
battles
with
their
turnkeys
,
and
the
majesty
of
the
law
fired
blunderbusses
in
among
them
,
loaded
with
rounds
of
shot
and
ball
;
thieves
snipped
off
diamond
crosses
from
the
necks
of
noble
lords
at
Court
drawing
-
rooms
;
musketeers
went
into
St
Giles
's
,
to
search
for
contraband
goods
,
and
the
mob
fired
on
the
musketeers
,
and
the
musketeers
fired
on
the
mob
,
and
nobody
thought
any
of
these
occurrences
much
out
of
the
common
way
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
them
,
the
hangman
,
ever
busy
and
ever
worse
than
useless
,
was
in
constant
requisition
;
now
,
stringing
up
long
rows
of
miscellaneous
criminals
;
now
,
hanging
a
housebreaker
on
Saturday
who
had
been
taken
on
Tuesday
;
now
,
burning
people
in
the
hand
at
Newgate
by
the
dozen
,
and
now
burning
pamphlets
at
the
door
of
Westminster
Hall
;
to
-
day
,
taking
the
life
of
an
atrocious
murderer
,
and
to
-
morrow
of
a
wretched
pilferer
who
had
robbed
a
farmer
's
boy
of
sixpence
.
   
<EOS>
All
these
things
,
and
a
thousand
like
them
,
came
to
pass
in
and
close
upon
the
dear
old
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
seventy
-
five
.
 
<EOS>
Environed
by
them
,
while
the
Woodman
and
the
Farmer
worked
unheeded
,
those
two
of
the
large
jaws
,
and
those
other
two
of
the
plain
and
the
fair
faces
,
trod
with
stir
enough
,
and
carried
their
divine
rights
with
a
high
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
did
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
seventy
-
five
conduct
their
Greatnesses
,
and
myriads
of
small
creatures
---
the
creatures
of
this
chronicle
among
the
rest
---
along
the
roads
that
lay
before
them
.

<EOS>
The
Mail
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
Dover
road
that
lay
,
on
a
Friday
night
late
in
November
,
before
the
first
of
the
persons
with
whom
this
history
has
business
.
<EOS>
The
Dover
road
lay
,
as
to
him
,
beyond
the
Dover
mail
,
as
it
lumbered
up
Shooter
's
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
He
walked
up
hill
in
the
mire
by
the
side
of
the
mail
,
as
the
rest
of
the
passengers
did
;
not
because
they
had
the
least
relish
for
walking
exercise
,
under
the
circumstances
,
but
because
the
hill
,
and
the
harness
,
and
the
mud
,
and
the
mail
,
were
all
so
heavy
,
that
the
horses
had
three
times
already
come
to
a
stop
,
besides
once
drawing
the
coach
across
the
road
,
with
the
mutinous
intent
of
taking
it
back
to
Blackheath
.
 
<EOS>
Reins
and
whip
and
coachman
and
guard
,
however
,
in
combination
,
had
read
that
article
of
war
which
forbade
a
purpose
otherwise
strongly
in
favour
of
the
argument
,
that
some
brute
animals
are
endued
with
Reason
;
and
the
team
had
capitulated
and
returned
to
their
duty
.
   
<EOS>
With
drooping
heads
and
tremulous
tails
,
they
mashed
their
way
through
the
thick
mud
,
floundering
and
stumbling
between
whiles
,
as
if
they
were
falling
to
pieces
at
the
larger
joints
.
 
<EOS>
As
often
as
the
driver
rested
them
and
brought
them
to
a
stand
,
with
a
wary
"
Wo
-
ho
!
<EOS>
so
-
ho
then
!
<EOS>
"
the
near
leader
violently
shook
his
head
and
everything
upon
it
---
like
an
unusually
emphatic
horse
,
denying
that
the
coach
could
be
got
up
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
the
leader
made
this
rattle
,
the
passenger
started
,
as
a
nervous
passenger
might
,
and
was
disturbed
in
mind
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
steaming
mist
in
all
the
hollows
,
and
it
had
roamed
in
its
forlornness
up
the
hill
,
like
an
evil
spirit
,
seeking
rest
and
finding
none
.
 
<EOS>
A
clammy
and
intensely
cold
mist
,
it
made
its
slow
way
through
the
air
in
ripples
that
visibly
followed
and
overspread
one
another
,
as
the
waves
of
an
unwholesome
sea
might
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
dense
enough
to
shut
out
everything
from
the
light
of
the
coach
-
lamps
<EOS>
but
these
its
own
workings
,
and
a
few
yards
of
road
;
and
the
reek
of
the
labouring
horses
steamed
into
it
,
as
if
they
had
made
it
all
.
   
<EOS>
Two
other
passengers
,
besides
the
one
,
were
plodding
up
the
hill
by
the
side
of
the
mail
.
 
<EOS>
All
three
were
wrapped
to
the
cheekbones
and
over
the
ears
,
and
wore
jack
-
boots
.
 
<EOS>
Not
one
of
the
three
could
have
said
,
from
anything
he
saw
,
what
either
of
the
other
two
was
like
;
and
each
was
hidden
under
almost
as
many
wrappers
from
the
eyes
of
the
mind
,
as
from
the
eyes
of
the
body
,
of
his
two
companions
.
 
<EOS>
In
those
days
,
travellers
were
very
shy
of
being
confidential
on
a
short
notice
,
for
anybody
on
the
road
might
be
a
robber
or
in
league
with
robbers
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
latter
,
when
every
posting
-
house
and
ale
-
house
could
produce
somebody
in
"
the
Captain
's
"
pay
,
ranging
from
the
landlord
to
the
lowest
stable
non
-
descript
,
it
was
the
likeliest
thing
upon
the
cards
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
guard
of
the
Dover
mail
thought
to
himself
,
that
Friday
night
in
November
,
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
seventy
-
five
,
lumbering
up
Shooter
's
Hill
,
as
he
stood
on
his
own
particular
perch
behind
the
mail
,
beating
his
feet
,
and
keeping
an
eye
and
a
hand
on
the
arm
-
chest
before
him
,
where
a
loaded
blunderbuss
lay
at
the
top
of
six
or
eight
loaded
horse
-
pistols
,
deposited
on
a
substratum
of
cutlass
.
   
<EOS>
The
Dover
mail
was
in
its
usual
genial
position
that
the
guard
suspected
the
passengers
,
the
passengers
suspected
one
another
and
the
guard
,
they
all
suspected
everybody
else
,
and
the
coachman
was
sure
of
nothing
but
the
horses
;
as
to
which
cattle
he
could
with
a
clear
conscience
have
taken
his
oath
on
the
two
Testaments
that
they
were
not
fit
for
the
journey
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wo
-
ho
!
"
said
the
coachman
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
,
then
!
 
<EOS>
One
more
pull
<EOS>
and
you
're
at
the
top
and
be
damned
to
you
,
for
I
have
had
trouble
enough
to
get
you
to
it
!
<EOS>
---
Joe
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
<EOS>
the
guard
replied
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
o'clock
do
you
make
it
,
Joe
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ten
minutes
,
good
,
past
eleven
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
blood
!
<EOS>
"
ejaculated
the
vexed
coachman
,
"
and
not
atop
of
Shooter
's
yet
!
 
<EOS>
Tst
!
 
<EOS>
Yah
!
 
<EOS>
Get
on
with
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
emphatic
horse
,
cut
short
by
the
whip
in
a
most
decided
negative
,
made
a
decided
scramble
for
it
,
and
the
three
other
horses
followed
suit
.
 
<EOS>
Once
more
,
the
Dover
mail
struggled
on
,
with
the
jack
-
boots
of
its
passengers
squashing
along
by
its
side
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
stopped
when
the
coach
stopped
,
and
they
kept
close
company
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
one
of
the
three
had
had
the
hardihood
to
propose
to
another
to
walk
on
a
little
ahead
into
the
mist
and
darkness
,
he
would
have
put
himself
in
a
fair
way
of
getting
shot
instantly
as
a
highwayman
.
   
<EOS>
The
last
burst
carried
the
mail
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
The
horses
stopped
to
breathe
again
,
and
the
guard
got
down
to
skid
the
wheel
for
the
descent
,
and
open
the
coach
-
door
to
let
the
passengers
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tst
!
 
<EOS>
Joe
!
"
cried
the
coachman
in
a
warning
voice
,
looking
down
from
his
box
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
,
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
They
both
listened
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
a
horse
at
a
canter
coming
up
,
Joe
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
\I\
say
a
horse
at
a
gallop
,
Tom
,
"
returned
the
guard
,
leaving
his
hold
of
the
door
,
and
mounting
nimbly
to
his
place
.
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
!
 
<EOS>
In
the
kings
name
,
all
of
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
hurried
adjuration
,
he
cocked
his
blunderbuss
,
and
stood
on
the
offensive
.
   
<EOS>
The
passenger
booked
by
this
history
,
was
on
the
coach
-
step
,
getting
in
;
the
two
other
passengers
were
close
behind
him
,
and
about
to
follow
.
 
<EOS>
He
remained
on
the
step
,
half
in
the
coach
and
half
out
of
;
they
re
-
mained
in
the
road
below
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
looked
from
the
coachman
to
the
guard
,
and
from
the
guard
to
the
coachman
,
and
listened
.
 
<EOS>
The
coachman
looked
back
and
the
guard
looked
back
,
and
even
the
emphatic
leader
pricked
up
his
ears
and
looked
back
,
without
contradicting
.
   
<EOS>
The
stillness
consequent
on
the
cessation
of
the
rumbling
and
and
labouring
of
the
coach
,
added
to
the
stillness
of
the
night
,
made
it
very
quiet
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
The
panting
of
the
horses
communicated
a
tremulous
motion
to
the
coach
,
as
if
it
were
in
a
state
of
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
The
hearts
of
the
passengers
beat
loud
enough
perhaps
to
be
heard
;
but
at
any
rate
,
the
quiet
pause
was
audibly
expressive
of
people
out
of
breath
,
and
holding
the
breath
,
and
having
the
pulses
quickened
by
expectation
.
   
<EOS>
The
sound
of
a
horse
at
a
gallop
came
fast
and
furiously
up
the
hill
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
-
ho
!
"
<EOS>
the
guard
sang
out
,
as
loud
as
he
could
roar
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yo
there
!
<EOS>
Stand
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
fire
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
pace
was
suddenly
checked
,
and
,
with
much
splashing
and
floundering
,
a
man
's
voice
called
from
the
mist
,
"
<EOS>
Is
that
the
Dover
mail
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Never
you
mind
what
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
the
guard
retorted
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
IS
that
the
Dover
mail
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
want
to
know
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
a
passenger
,
if
it
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
passenger
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Jarvis
Lorry
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Our
booked
passenger
showed
in
a
moment
that
it
was
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
The
guard
,
the
coachman
,
and
the
two
other
passengers
eyed
him
distrustfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
Keep
where
you
are
,
"
the
guard
called
to
the
voice
in
the
mist
,
"
because
,
if
I
should
make
a
mistake
,
it
could
never
be
set
right
in
your
lifetime
.
 
<EOS>
Gentleman
of
the
name
of
Lorry
answer
straight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
passenger
,
then
,
with
mildly
quavering
speech
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
wants
me
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
Jerry
?
"
   
<EOS>
(
"
I
do
n't
like
Jerry
's
voice
,
if
it
is
Jerry
,
"
<EOS>
growled
the
guard
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
hoarser
than
suits
me
,
is
Jerry
.
"
)
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Mr
Lorry
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
despatch
sent
after
you
from
over
yonder
.
 
<EOS>
T
and
Co.
"
   
"
I
know
this
messenger
,
guard
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
getting
down
into
the
road
---
assisted
from
behind
more
swiftly
than
politely
by
the
other
two
passengers
,
who
immediately
scrambled
into
the
coach
,
shut
the
door
,
and
pulled
up
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
may
come
close
;
there
's
nothing
wrong
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
there
ai
n't
,
but
I
ca
n't
make
so
'
Nation
sure
of
that
,
"
said
the
guard
,
in
gruff
soliloquy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hallo
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
And
hallo
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
Jerry
,
more
hoarsely
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
on
at
a
footpace
!
<EOS>
d'ye
mind
me
?
 
<EOS>
And
if
you
've
got
holsters
to
that
saddle
<EOS>
o
'
yourn
,
do
n't
let
me
see
your
hand
go
nigh
'em
.
<EOS>
For
I
'm
a
devil
at
a
quick
mistake
,
and
when
I
make
one
<EOS>
it
takes
the
form
of
Lead
.
 
<EOS>
So
now
let
's
look
at
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
figures
of
a
horse
and
rider
came
slowly
through
the
eddying
mist
,
and
came
to
the
side
of
the
mail
,
where
the
passenger
stood
.
<EOS>
The
rider
stooped
,
and
,
casting
up
his
eyes
at
the
guard
,
handed
the
passenger
a
small
folded
paper
.
 
<EOS>
The
rider
's
horse
was
blown
,
and
both
horse
and
rider
were
covered
with
mud
,
from
the
hoofs
of
the
horse
to
the
hat
of
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Guard
!
"
said
the
passenger
,
in
a
tone
of
quiet
business
confidence
.
   
<EOS>
The
watchful
guard
,
with
his
right
hand
at
the
stock
of
his
raised
blunderbuss
,
his
left
at
the
barrel
,
and
his
eye
on
the
horseman
,
answered
curtly
,
"
Sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
to
apprehend
.
 
<EOS>
I
belong
to
Tellson
's
Bank
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
know
Tellson
's
Bank
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
Paris
on
business
.
 
<EOS>
A
crown
to
drink
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
read
this
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
so
be
as
you
're
quick
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
opened
it
in
the
light
of
the
coach
-
lamp
on
that
side
,
and
read
---
first
to
himself
and
then
aloud
:
 
"
"
Wait
at
Dover
for
Mam'selle
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
long
,
you
see
,
guard
.
 
<EOS>
Jerry
,
say
that
my
answer
was
,
RECALLED
TO
LIFE
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jerry
started
in
his
saddle
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
Blazing
strange
answer
,
too
,
"
said
he
,
at
his
hoarsest
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
that
message
back
,
and
they
will
know
that
I
received
this
,
as
well
as
if
I
wrote
.
 
<EOS>
Make
the
best
of
your
way
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
those
words
the
passenger
opened
the
coach
-
door
and
got
in
;
not
at
all
assisted
by
his
fellow
-
passengers
,
who
had
expeditiously
secreted
their
watches
and
purses
in
their
boots
,
and
were
now
making
a
general
pretence
of
being
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
With
no
more
definite
purpose
than
to
escape
the
hazard
of
originating
any
other
kind
of
action
.
   
<EOS>
The
coach
lumbered
on
again
,
with
heavier
wreaths
of
mist
closing
round
it
as
it
began
the
descent
.
<EOS>
The
guard
soon
replaced
his
blunderbuss
in
his
arm
-
chest
,
and
,
having
looked
to
the
rest
of
its
contents
,
and
having
looked
to
the
supplementary
pistols
that
he
wore
in
his
belt
,
looked
to
a
smaller
chest
beneath
his
seat
,
in
which
there
were
a
few
smith
's
tools
,
a
couple
of
torches
,
and
a
tinder
-
box
.
 
<EOS>
For
he
was
furnished
with
that
completeness
that
if
the
coach
-
lamps
had
been
blown
and
stormed
out
,
which
did
occasionally
happen
,
he
had
only
to
shut
himself
up
inside
,
keep
the
flint
and
steel
sparks
well
off
the
straw
,
and
get
a
light
with
tolerable
safety
and
ease
(
if
he
were
lucky
)
in
five
minutes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
!
"
<EOS>
softly
over
the
coach
roof
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hallo
,
Joe
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
hear
the
message
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
Joe
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
make
of
it
,
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
at
all
,
Joe
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
coincidence
,
too
,
"
the
guard
mused
,
"
for
I
made
the
same
of
it
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jerry
,
left
alone
in
the
mist
and
darkness
,
dismounted
meanwhile
,
not
only
to
ease
his
spent
horse
,
but
to
wipe
the
mud
from
his
face
,
and
shake
the
wet
out
of
his
hat
-
brim
,
which
might
be
capable
of
holding
about
half
a
gallon
.
 
<EOS>
After
standing
with
the
bridle
over
his
heavily
-
splashed
arm
,
until
the
wheels
of
the
mail
were
no
longer
within
hearing
and
the
night
was
quite
still
again
,
he
turned
to
walk
down
the
hill
.
   
<EOS>
"
After
that
there
gallop
from
Temple
Bar
,
old
lady
,
I
wo
n't
trust
your
fore
-
legs
till
I
get
you
on
the
level
,
"
said
this
hoarse
messenger
,
glancing
at
his
mare
.
 
<EOS>
"
"
Recalled
to
life
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
Blazing
strange
message
.
 
<EOS>
Much
of
that
would
n't
do
for
you
,
Jerry
!
<EOS>
I
say
,
Jerry
!
 
<EOS>
You
'd
be
in
a
Blazing
bad
way
,
if
recalling
to
life
was
to
come
into
fashion

Chapter

<EOS>
The
Night
<EOS>
Shadows
 
<EOS>
A
Wonderful
fact
to
reflect
upon
,
that
every
human
creature
is
constituted
to
be
that
profound
secret
and
mystery
to
every
other
.
<EOS>
A
solemn
consideration
,
when
I
enter
a
great
city
by
night
,
that
every
one
of
those
darkly
clustered
houses
encloses
its
own
secret
;
that
every
room
in
every
one
of
them
encloses
its
own
secret
;
that
every
beating
heart
in
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
breasts
there
,
is
,
in
some
of
its
imaginings
,
a
secret
to
the
heart
nearest
it
!
<EOS>
Something
of
the
awfulness
,
even
of
Death
itself
,
is
referable
to
this
.
 
<EOS>
No
more
can
I
turn
the
leaves
of
this
dear
book
that
I
loved
,
and
vainly
hope
in
time
to
read
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
No
more
can
I
look
into
the
depths
of
this
unfathomable
water
,
wherein
,
as
momentary
lights
glanced
into
it
<EOS>
,
I
have
had
glimpses
of
buried
treasure
and
other
things
submerged
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
appointed
that
the
book
should
shut
with
a
a
spring
,
for
ever
and
for
ever
,
when
I
had
read
but
a
page
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
appointed
that
the
water
should
be
locked
in
an
eternal
frost
,
when
the
light
was
playing
on
its
surface
,
and
I
stood
in
ignorance
on
the
shore
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
is
dead
,
my
neighbour
is
dead
,
my
love
,
the
darling
of
my
soul
,
is
dead
;
it
is
the
inexorable
consolidation
and
perpetuation
of
the
secret
that
was
always
in
that
individuality
,
and
which
I
shall
carry
in
mine
to
my
life
's
end
.
 
<EOS>
In
any
of
the
burial
-
places
of
this
city
through
which
I
pass
,
is
there
a
sleeper
more
inscrutable
than
its
busy
inhabitants
are
,
in
their
innermost
personality
,
to
me
,
or
than
I
am
to
them
?
   
<EOS>
As
to
this
,
his
natural
and
not
to
be
alienated
inheritance
,
the
messenger
on
horseback
had
exactly
the
same
possessions
as
the
King
,
the
first
Minister
of
State
,
or
the
richest
merchant
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
So
with
the
three
passengers
shut
up
in
the
narrow
compass
of
one
lumbering
old
mail
coach
;
they
were
mysteries
to
one
another
,
as
complete
as
if
each
had
been
in
his
own
coach
and
six
,
or
his
own
coach
and
sixty
,
with
the
breadth
of
a
county
between
him
and
the
next
.
   
<EOS>
The
messenger
rode
back
at
an
easy
trot
,
stopping
pretty
often
at
ale
-
houses
by
the
way
to
drink
,
but
evincing
a
tendency
to
keep
his
own
counsel
,
and
to
keep
his
hat
cocked
over
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
eyes
that
assorted
very
well
with
that
decoration
,
being
of
a
surface
black
,
with
no
depth
in
the
colour
or
form
,
and
much
too
near
together
---
as
if
they
were
afraid
of
being
found
out
in
something
,
singly
,
if
they
kept
too
far
apart
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
a
sinister
expression
,
under
an
old
cocked
-
hat
like
a
three
-
cornered
spittoon
,
and
over
a
great
muffler
for
the
chin
and
throat
,
which
descended
nearly
to
the
wearer
's
knees
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
stopped
for
drink
,
he
moved
this
muffler
with
his
left
hand
,
only
while
he
poured
his
liquor
in
with
his
right
;
as
soon
as
that
was
done
,
he
muffled
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Jerry
,
no
!
"
said
the
messenger
,
harping
on
one
theme
as
he
rode
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
n't
do
for
you
,
Jerry
.
 
<EOS>
Jerry
,
you
honest
tradesman
,
it
would
n't
suit
YOUR
line
of
business
!
 
<EOS>
Recalled
---
!
 
<EOS>
Bust
me
if
I
do
n't
think
he
'd
been
a
drinking
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
message
perplexed
his
mind
to
that
degree
that
he
was
fain
,
several
times
,
to
take
off
his
hat
to
scratch
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
Except
on
the
crown
,
which
was
raggedly
bald
,
he
had
stiff
,
black
hair
,
standing
jaggedly
all
over
it
,
and
growing
down
hill
almost
to
his
broad
,
blunt
nose
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
so
like
Smith
's
work
,
so
much
more
like
the
top
of
a
strongly
spiked
wall
than
a
head
of
hair
,
that
the
best
of
players
at
leap
-
frog
might
have
declined
him
,
as
the
most
dangerous
man
in
the
world
to
go
over
.
   
<EOS>
While
he
trotted
back
with
the
message
he
was
to
deliver
to
the
night
watchman
in
his
box
at
the
door
of
Tellson
's
Bank
,
by
Temple
Bar
,
who
was
to
deliver
it
to
greater
authorities
within
,
the
shadows
of
the
night
took
such
shapes
to
him
as
arose
out
of
the
message
,
and
took
such
shapes
to
the
mare
as
arose
out
of
HER
private
topics
of
uneasiness
.
 
<EOS>
They
seemed
to
be
numerous
,
for
she
shied
at
every
shadow
on
the
road
.
   
<EOS>
What
time
,
the
mail
-
coach
lumbered
,
jolted
,
rattled
,
and
bumped
upon
its
tedious
way
,
with
its
three
fellow
-
inscrutables
inside
.
 
<EOS>
To
whom
,
likewise
,
the
shadows
of
the
night
revealed
themselves
,
in
the
forms
their
dozing
eyes
and
wandering
thoughts
suggested
.
   
<EOS>
Tellson
's
Bank
had
a
run
upon
it
in
the
mail
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
bank
passenger
---
with
an
arm
drawn
through
the
leathern
strap
,
which
did
what
lay
in
it
to
keep
him
from
pounding
against
the
next
passenger
,
and
driving
him
into
his
corner
,
whenever
the
coach
got
a
special
jolt
---
nodded
in
his
place
,
with
half
-
shut
eyes
,
the
little
coach
-
windows
,
and
the
coach
-
lamp
dimly
gleaming
through
them
,
and
the
bulky
bundle
of
opposite
passenger
,
became
the
bank
,
and
did
a
great
stroke
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
The
rattle
of
the
harness
was
the
chink
of
money
,
and
more
drafts
were
honoured
in
five
minutes
than
even
Tellson
's
,
with
all
its
foreign
and
home
connection
,
ever
paid
in
thrice
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
strong
-
rooms
underground
,
at
Tellson
's
,
with
such
of
their
valuable
stores
and
secrets
as
were
known
to
the
passenger
(
and
it
was
not
a
little
that
he
knew
about
them
)
,
opened
before
him
,
and
he
went
in
among
them
with
the
great
keys
and
the
feebly
-
burning
candle
,
and
found
them
safe
,
and
strong
,
and
sound
,
and
still
,
just
as
he
had
last
seen
them
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
though
the
bank
was
almost
always
with
him
,
and
though
the
coach
(
in
a
confused
way
,
like
the
presence
of
pain
under
an
opiate
)
was
always
with
him
,
there
was
another
current
of
impression
that
never
ceased
to
run
,
all
through
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
on
his
way
to
dig
some
one
out
of
a
grave
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
which
of
the
multitude
of
faces
that
showed
themselves
before
him
was
the
true
face
of
the
buried
person
,
the
shadows
of
the
night
did
not
indicate
;
but
they
were
all
the
faces
of
a
man
of
five
-
and
-
forty
by
years
,
and
they
differed
principally
in
the
passions
they
expressed
,
and
in
the
ghastliness
of
their
worn
and
wasted
state
.
<EOS>
Pride
,
contempt
,
defiance
,
stubbornness
,
submission
,
lamentation
,
succeeded
one
another
;
so
did
varieties
of
sunken
cheek
,
cadaverous
colour
,
emaciated
hands
and
figures
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
face
was
in
the
main
one
face
,
and
every
head
was
prematurely
white
.
 
<EOS>
A
hundred
times
the
dozing
passenger
inquired
of
this
spectre
:
   
<EOS>
"
Buried
how
long
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
answer
was
always
the
same
:
 
"
Almost
eighteen
years
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
abandoned
all
hope
of
being
dug
out
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Long
ago
.
"
   
"
You
know
that
you
are
recalled
to
life
?
"
   
"
They
tell
me
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
care
to
live
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
show
her
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
come
and
see
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
answers
to
this
question
were
various
and
contradictory
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
the
broken
reply
was
,
"
Wait
!
 
<EOS>
It
would
kill
me
if
I
saw
her
too
soon
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
it
was
given
in
a
tender
rain
of
tears
,
and
then
it
was
,
"
Take
me
to
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
it
was
staring
and
bewildered
,
and
then
it
was
,
"
I
do
n't
know
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
understand
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
After
such
imaginary
discourse
,
the
passenger
in
his
fancy
would
dig
,
and
dig
,
dig
---
now
with
a
spade
,
now
with
a
great
key
,
now
with
his
hands
---
to
dig
this
wretched
creature
out
.
 
<EOS>
Got
out
at
last
,
with
earth
hanging
about
his
face
and
hair
,
he
would
suddenly
fan
away
to
dust
.
 
<EOS>
The
passenger
would
then
start
to
himself
,
and
lower
the
window
,
to
get
the
reality
of
mist
and
rain
on
his
cheek
.
   
<EOS>
Yet
even
when
his
eyes
were
opened
on
the
mist
and
rain
,
on
the
moving
patch
of
light
from
the
lamps
,
and
the
hedge
at
the
roadside
retreating
by
jerks
,
the
night
shadows
outside
the
coach
would
fall
into
the
train
of
the
night
shadows
within
.
 
<EOS>
The
real
Banking
-
house
by
Temple
Bar
,
the
real
business
of
the
past
day
,
the
real
strong
rooms
<EOS>
,
the
real
express
sent
after
him
,
and
the
real
message
returned
,
would
all
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
Out
of
the
midst
of
them
,
the
ghostly
face
would
rise
,
and
he
would
accost
it
again
.
   
<EOS>

Dig
---
dig
---
dig

until
an
impatient
movement
from
one
of
the
two
passengers
would
admonish
him
to
pull
up
the
window
,
draw
his
arm
securely
through
the
leathern
strap
,
and
speculate
upon
the
two
slumbering
forms
,
until
his
mind
lost
its
hold
of
them
,
and
they
again
slid
away
into
the
bank
and
the
grave

<EOS>
The
words
were
still
in
his
hearing
as
just
spoken
---
distinctly
in
his
hearing
as
ever
spoken
words
had
been
in
his
life
---
when
the
weary
passenger
started
to
the
consciousness
of
daylight
,
and
found
that
the
shadows
of
the
night
were
gone
.
   
<EOS>
He
lowered
the
window
,
and
looked
out
at
the
rising
sun
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
ridge
of
ploughed
land
,
with
a
plough
upon
it
where
it
had
been
left
last
night
when
the
horses
were
unyoked
;
beyond
,
a
quiet
coppice
-
wood
,
in
which
many
leaves
of
burning
red
and
golden
yellow
still
remained
upon
the
trees
.
 
<EOS>
Though
the
earth
was
cold
and
wet
,
the
sky
was
clear
,
and
the
sun
rose
bright
,
placid
,
and
beautiful
.
   
<EOS>
"
Eighteen

said
the
passenger
,
looking
at
the
sun
.

To

The
Preparation
 
<EOS>
When
the
mail
got
successfully
to
Dover
,
in
the
course
of
the
forenoon
,
the
head
drawer
at
the
Royal
George
Hotel
opened
the
coach
-
door
as
his
custom
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
it
with
some
flourish
of
ceremony
,
for
a
mail
journey
from
London
in
winter
<EOS>
was
an
achievement
to
congratulate
an
adventurous
traveller
upon
.
   
<EOS>
By
that
time
,
there
was
only
one
adventurous
traveller
left
be
congratulated
:
 
for
the
two
others
had
been
set
down
at
their
respective
roadside
destinations
.
 
<EOS>
The
mildewy
inside
of
the
coach
,
with
its
damp
and
dirty
straw
,
its
disageeable
smell
,
and
its
obscurity
,
was
rather
like
a
larger
dog
-
kennel
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
,
the
passenger
,
shaking
himself
out
of
it
in
chains
of
straw
,
a
tangle
of
shaggy
wrapper
,
flapping
hat
,
and
muddy
legs
,
was
rather
like
a
larger
sort
of
dog
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
will
be
a
packet
to
Calais
,
tomorrow

drawer

"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes

if
the
weather
holds
and
the
wind
sets
tolerable
fair

will
serve
pretty
nicely

<EOS>
The
Concord
bed
-
chamber
being
always
assigned
to
a
passenger
by
the
mail
,
and
passengers
by
the
mail
being
always
heavily
wrapped
up
from
bead
to
foot
,
the
room
had
the
odd
interest
for
the
establishment
of
the
Royal
George
,
that
although
but
one
kind
of
man
was
seen
to
go
into
it
,
all
kinds
and
varieties
of
men
came
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
Consequently
,
another
drawer
,
and
two
porters
,
and
several
maids
and
the
landlady
,
were
all
loitering
by
accident
at
various
points
of
the
road
between
the
Concord
and
the
coffee
-
room
,
when
a
gentleman
of
sixty
,
formally
dressed
in
a
brown
suit
of
clothes
,
pretty
well
worn
,
but
very
well
kept
,
with
large
square
cuffs
and
large
flaps
to
the
pockets
,
passed
along
on
his
way
to
his
breakfast
.
   
<EOS>
The
coffee
-
room
had
no
other
occupant
,
that
forenoon
,
than
the
gentleman
in
brown
.
 
<EOS>
His
breakfast
-
table
was
drawn
before
the
fire
,
and
as
he
sat
,
with
its
light
shining
on
him
,
waiting
for
the
meal
,
he
sat
so
still
,
that
he
might
have
been
sitting
for
his
portrait
.
   
<EOS>
Very
orderly
and
methodical
he
looked
,
with
a
hand
on
each
knee
,
and
a
loud
watch
ticking
a
sonorous
sermon
under
his
flapped
waist
-
coat
,
as
though
it
pitted
its
gravity
and
longevity
against
the
levity
and
evanescence
of
the
brisk
fire
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
good
leg
,
and
was
a
little
vain
of
it
,
for
his
brown
stockings
fitted
sleek
and
close
,
and
were
of
a
fine
texture
;
his
shoes
and
buckles
,
too
,
though
plain
,
were
trim
.
 
<EOS>
He
wore
an
odd
little
sleek
crisp
flaxen
wig
,
setting
very
close
to
his
head
:
 
which
wig
<EOS>
,
it
is
to
be
presumed
,
was
made
of
hair
,
but
which
looked
far
more
as
though
it
were
spun
from
filaments
of
silk
or
glass
.
 
<EOS>
His
linen
,
though
not
of
a
fineness
in
accordance
with
his
stockings
,
was
as
white
as
the
tops
of
the
waves
that
broke
upon
the
neighbouring
beach
,
or
the
specks
of
sail
that
glinted
in
the
sunlight
far
at
sea
.
 
<EOS>
A
face
habitually
suppressed
and
quieted
,
was
still
lighted
up
under
the
quaint
wig
by
a
pair
of
moist
bright
eyes
that
it
must
have
cost
their
owner
,
in
years
gone
by
,
some
pains
to
drill
to
the
composed
and
reserved
expression
of
Tellson
's
Bank
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
healthy
colour
in
his
cheeks
,
and
his
face
,
though
lined
,
bore
few
traces
of
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
perhaps
the
confidential
bachelor
clerks
in
Tellson
's
Bank
were
principally
occupied
with
the
cares
of
other
people
;
and
perhaps
second
-
hand
cares
,
like
second
-
hand
clothes
,
come
easily
off
and
on
.
   
<EOS>
Completing
his
resemblance
to
a
man
who
was
sitting
for
his
portrait
,
Mr
Lorry
dropped
off
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
The
arrival
of
his
breakfast
roused
him
,
and
he
said
to
the
drawer
,
as
he
moved
his
chair
to
it
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
accommodation
prepared
for
a
young
lady
who
may
come
here

time

She
may
ask
for
Mr
Jarvis
Lorry

or
she
may
only
ask
for
a
gentleman

Tellson
's
Bank

Please

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes

sir
.
 
<EOS>
Not
much
in
the
habit
of
such
travelling
yourself
,
I
think
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Not
of
late
years

years

came
last
from
France

"
<EOS>
Indeed

?
 
<EOS>
That
was
before
my
time
here
,
sir

<EOS>
Before
our
people
's
time
here

<EOS>
The
George
was
in
other
hands
at
that
time
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
would
hold
a
pretty
wager
,
sir
,
that
a
House
like
Tellson
and
Company
was
flourishing
,
a
matter
of
fifty
,
not
to
speak
of
fifteen
years
ago
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
might
treble
that
,
and
say
a
hundred
and
fifty
,
yet
not
be
far
from
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
Rounding
his
mouth
and
both
his
eyes
,
as
he
stepped
backward
from
the
table
,
the
waiter
shifted
his
napkin
from
his
right
arm
to
his
left
,
dropped
into
a
comfortable
attitude
,
and
stood
surveying
the
guest
while
he
ate
and
drank
,
as
from
an
observatory
or
watchtower
.
<EOS>
According
to
the
immemorial
usage
of
waiters
in
all
ages
.
   
<EOS>
When
Mr
Lorry
had
finished
his
breakfast
,
he
went
out
for
a
stroll
on
the
beach
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
narrow
,
crooked
town
of
Dover
hid
itself
away
from
the
beach
,
and
ran
its
head
into
the
chalk
cliffs
,
like
a
marine
ostrich
.
 
<EOS>
The
beach
was
a
desert
of
heaps
of
sea
and
stones
tumbling
wildly
about
,
and
the
sea
did
what
it
liked
,
and
what
it
liked
was
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
It
thundered
at
the
town
,
and
thundered
at
the
cliffs
,
and
brought
the
coast
down
,
madly
.
 
<EOS>
The
air
among
the
houses
was
of
so
strong
a
piscatory
flavour
that
one
might
have
supposed
sick
fish
went
up
to
be
dipped
in
it
,
as
sick
people
went
down
to
be
dipped
in
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
fishing
was
done
in
the
port
,
and
a
quantity
of
strolling
about
by
night
,
and
looking
seaward
:
particularly
at
those
times
when
the
tide
made
,
and
was
near
flood
.
<EOS>
Small
tradesmen
,
who
did
no
business
whatever
,
sometimes
unaccountably
realised
large
fortunes
,
and
it
was
remarkable
that
nobody
in
the
neighbourhood
could
endure
a
lamplighter
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
day
declined
into
the
afternoon
,
and
the
air
,
which
had
been
at
intervals
clear
enough
to
allow
the
French
coast
to
be
seen
,
became
again
charged
with
mist
and
vapour
,
Mr
Lorry
's
thoughts
seemed
to
cloud
too
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
was
dark
,
and
he
sat
before
the
coffee
-
room
fire
,
awaiting
his
dinner
as
he
had
awaited
his
breakfast
,
his
mind
was
busily
digging
,
digging
,
digging
,
in
the
live
red
coals
.
   
<EOS>
A
bottle
of
good
claret
after
dinner
does
a
digger
in
the
red
coals
no
harm
,
otherwise
than
as
it
has
a
tendency
to
throw
him
out
of
work
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
had
been
idle
a
long
time
,
and
had
just
poured
out
his
last
glassful
of
wine
with
as
complete
an
appearance
of
satisfaction
as
is
ever
to
be
found
in
an
elderly
gentleman
of
a
fresh
complexion
who
has
got
to
the
end
of
a
bottle
,
when
a
rattling
of
wheels
came
up
the
narrow
street
,
and
rumbled
into
the
inn
-
yard
.
   
<EOS>
He
set
down
his
glass
untouched
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
Mam'selle
!
"
said
he
.
   
<EOS>
In
a
very
few
minutes
the
waiter
came
in
to
announce
that
Miss
Manette
had
arrived
from
London
,
and
would
be
happy
to
see
the
gentleman
from
Tellson
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
soon
?
"
   
Miss
Manette
had
taken
some
refreshment
on
the
road
,
and
required
none
then
,
and
was
extremely
anxious
to
see
the
gentleman
from
Tellson
's
immediately
,
if
it
suited
his
pleasure
and
convenience
.
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
from
Tellson
's
had
nothing
left
for
it
but
to
empty
his
glass
with
an
air
of
stolid
desperation
,
settle
his
odd
little
flaxen
wig
at
the
ears
,
and
follow
the
waiter
to
Miss
Manette
's
apartment
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
large
,
dark
room
,
furnished
in
a
funereal
manner
with
black
horsehair
,
and
loaded
with
heavy
dark
tables
.
 
<EOS>
These
had
been
oiled
and
oiled
,
until
the
two
tall
candles
on
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
were
gloomily
reflected
on
every
leaf
;
as
if
THEY
were
buried
,
in
deep
graves
of
black
mahogany
,
and
no
light
to
speak
of
could
be
expected
from
them
until
they
were
dug
out
.
   
<EOS>
The
obscurity
was
so
difficult
to
penetrate
that
Mr
Lorry
,
picking
his
way
over
the
well
-
worn
Turkey
carpet
,
supposed
   
Miss
Manette
to
be
,
for
the
moment
,
in
some
adjacent
room
,
until
,
having
got
past
the
two
tall
candles
,
he
saw
standing
to
receive
him
by
the
table
between
them
and
the
fire
,
a
young
lady
of
not
more
than
seventeen
,
in
a
riding
-
cloak
,
and
still
holding
her
straw
travelling
-
hat
by
its
ribbon
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
As
his
eyes
rested
on
a
short
,
slight
,
pretty
figure
,
a
quantity
of
golden
hair
,
a
pair
of
blue
eyes
that
met
his
own
with
an
inquiring
look
,
and
a
forehead
with
a
singular
capacity
(
remembering
how
young
and
smooth
it
was
)
,
of
rifting
and
knitting
itself
into
an
expression
that
was
not
quite
one
of
perplexity
,
or
wonder
,
or
alarm
,
or
merely
of
a
bright
fixed
attention
,
though
it
included
all
the
four
expressions
-
as
his
eyes
rested
on
these
things
,
a
sudden
vivid
likeness
passed
before
him
,
of
a
child
whom
he
had
held
in
his
arms
on
the
passage
across
that
very
Channel
,
one
cold
time
,
when
the
hail
drifted
heavily
and
the
sea
ran
high
.
 
<EOS>
The
likeness
passed
away
,
like
a
breath
along
the
surface
of
the
gaunt
pier
-
glass
behind
her
,
on
the
frame
of
which
,
a
hospital
procession
of
negro
cupids
,
several
headless
and
all
cripples
,
were
offering
black
baskets
of
Dead
Sea
fruit
to
black
divinities
of
the
feminine
gender
-
and
he
made
his
formal
bow
to
Miss
Manette
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
take
a
seat
,
sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
a
very
clear
and
pleasant
young
voice
;
a
little
foreign
in
its
accent
,
but
a
very
little
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
kiss
your
hand
,
miss
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
with
the
manners
of
an
earlier
date
,
as
he
made
his
formal
bow
again
,
and
took
his
seat
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
received
a
letter
from
the
Bank
,
sir
,
yesterday
,
informing
me
that
some
intelligence
---
or
discovery
---
"
   
"
The
word
is
not
material
,
miss
;
either
word
will
do
.
"
   
"
---
respecting
the
small
property
of
my
poor
father
,
whom
I
never
saw
---
so
long
dead
---
"
   
Mr
Lorry
moved
in
his
chair
,
and
cast
a
troubled
look
towards
the
hospital
procession
of
negro
cupids
.
 
<EOS>
As
if
THEY
had
any
help
for
anybody
in
their
absurd
baskets
!
   
<EOS>
"
---
rendered
it
necessary
that
I
should
go
to
Paris
,
there
to
communicate
with
a
gentleman
of
the
Bank
,
so
good
as
to
be
despatched
to
Paris
for
the
purpose
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
I
was
prepared
to
hear
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
curtseyed
to
him
(
young
ladies
made
curtseys
in
those
days
)
,
with
a
pretty
desire
to
convey
to
him
that
she
felt
how
much
older
and
wiser
he
was
than
she
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
her
another
bow
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
replied
to
the
Bank
,
sir
,
that
as
it
was
considered
necessary
,
by
those
who
know
,
and
who
are
so
kind
as
to
advise
me
,
that
I
should
go
to
France
,
and
that
as
I
am
an
orphan
and
have
no
friend
who
could
go
with
me
,
I
should
esteem
it
highly
if
I
might
be
permitted
to
place
myself
,
during
the
journey
,
under
that
worthy
gentleman
's
protection
.
<EOS>
The
gentleman
had
left
London
,
but
I
think
a
messenger
was
sent
after
him
to
beg
the
favour
of
his
waiting
for
me
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
happy
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
"
to
be
entrusted
with
the
charge
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
more
happy
to
execute
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
thank
you
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
you
very
gratefully
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
told
me
by
the
Bank
that
the
gentleman
would
explain
to
me
the
details
of
the
business
,
and
that
I
must
prepare
myself
to
find
them
of
a
surprising
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
done
my
best
to
prepare
myself
,
and
I
naturally
have
a
strong
and
eager
interest
to
know
what
they
are
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Naturally
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
---
I
---
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
pause
,
he
added
,
again
settling
the
crisp
flaxen
wig
at
the
ears
,
"
It
is
very
difficult
to
begin
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
did
not
begin
,
but
,
in
his
indecision
,
met
her
glance
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
forehead
lifted
itself
into
that
singular
expression
---
but
it
was
pretty
and
characteristic
,
besides
being
singular
---
and
she
raised
her
hand
,
as
if
with
an
involuntary
action
she
caught
at
,
or
stayed
some
passing
shadow
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
quite
a
stranger
to
me
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Am
I
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
opened
his
hands
,
and
extended
them
outwards
with
an
argumentative
smile
.
   
<EOS>
Between
the
eyebrows
and
just
over
the
little
feminine
nose
,
the
line
of
which
was
as
delicate
and
fine
as
it
was
possible
to
be
,
the
expression
deepened
itself
as
she
took
her
seat
thoughtfully
in
the
chair
by
which
she
had
hitherto
<EOS>
remained
standing
.
 
<EOS>
He
watched
her
as
she
mused
,
and
the
moment
she
raised
her
eyes
again
,
went
on
:
   
"
<EOS>
In
your
adopted
country
,
I
presume
,
I
can
not
do
better
than
address
you
as
a
young
English
lady
,
Miss
Manette
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
sir
.
"
   
"
Miss
Manette
,
I
am
a
man
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
business
charge
to
acquit
myself
of
.
 
<EOS>
In
your
reception
of
it
,
do
n't
heed
me
any
more
than
if
I
was
a
speaking
machine
---
<EOS>
truly
,
I
am
not
much
else
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
with
your
leave
,
relate
to
you
,
miss
,
the
story
of
one
of
our
customers
.
"
   
"
Story
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
seemed
wilfully
to
mistake
the
word
she
had
repeated
,
when
he
added
,
in
a
hurry
,
"
Yes
,
customers
;
in
the
banking
business
we
usually
call
our
connection
our
customers
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
French
gentleman
;
a
scientific
gentleman
;
a
man
of
great
acquirements
---
a
Doctor
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Not
of
Beauvais
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
of
Beauvais
.
 
<EOS>
Like
Monsieur
Manette
,
your
father
,
the
gentleman
was
of
Beauvais
.
 
<EOS>
Like
Monsieur
Manette
,
your
father
,
the
gentleman
was
of
repute
in
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
the
honour
of
knowing
him
there
.
 
<EOS>
Our
relations
were
business
relations
,
but
confidential
.
<EOS>
I
was
at
that
time
in
our
French
House
,
and
had
been
---
oh
!
<EOS>
twenty
years
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
that
time
---
I
may
ask
,
at
what
time
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
speak
,
miss
,
of
twenty
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
He
married
---
an
English
lady
---
and
I
was
one
of
the
trustees
.
 
<EOS>
His
affairs
,
like
the
affairs
of
many
other
French
gentlemen
and
French
families
,
were
entirely
in
Tellson
's
hands
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
similar
way
I
am
,
or
I
have
been
,
trustee
of
one
kind
or
other
for
scores
of
our
customers
.
 
<EOS>
These
are
mere
business
relations
,
miss
;
there
is
no
friendship
in
them
,
no
particular
interest
,
nothing
like
sentiment
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
passed
from
one
to
another
,
in
the
course
of
my
business
life
,
just
as
I
pass
from
one
of
our
customers
to
another
in
the
course
of
my
business
day
;
in
short
,
I
have
no
feelings
;
I
am
a
mere
machine
.
 
<EOS>
To
go
on
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
But
this
is
my
father
's
story
,
sir
;
and
I
begin
to
think
"
 
---
the
curiously
roughened
forehead
was
very
intent
upon
him
---
"
<EOS>
that
when
I
was
left
an
orphan
through
my
mother
's
surviving
my
father
only
two
years
,
it
was
you
who
brought
me
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
almost
sure
it
was
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
took
the
hesitating
little
hand
that
confidingly
advanced
to
take
his
,
and
he
put
it
with
some
ceremony
to
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
conducted
the
young
lady
straightway
to
her
chair
again
,
and
,
holding
the
chair
-
back
with
his
left
hand
,
and
using
his
right
by
turns
to
rub
his
chin
,
pull
his
wig
at
the
ears
,
or
point
what
he
said
,
stood
looking
down
into
her
face
while
she
sat
looking
up
into
his
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Manette
,
it
WAS
I.
<EOS>
And
you
will
see
how
truly
I
spoke
of
myself
just
now
,
in
saying
I
had
no
feelings
,
and
that
all
the
relations
I
hold
with
my
fellow
-
creatures
are
mere
business
relations
,
when
you
reflect
that
I
have
never
seen
you
since
.
 
<EOS>
No
<EOS>
;
you
have
been
the
ward
of
Tellson
's
House
since
,
and
I
have
been
busy
with
the
other
business
of
Tellson
's
House
since
.
 
<EOS>
Feelings
!
<EOS>
I
have
no
time
for
them
,
no
chance
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
pass
my
whole
life
,
miss
,
in
turning
an
immense
pecuniary
Mangle
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
this
odd
description
of
his
daily
routine
of
employment
,
Mr
Lorry
flattened
his
flaxen
wig
upon
his
head
with
both
hands
(
which
was
most
unnecessary
,
for
nothing
could
be
flatter
than
its
shining
surface
was
before
)
,
and
resumed
his
former
attitude
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
far
,
miss
(
as
you
have
remarked
)
,
this
is
the
story
of
your
gretted
father
.
 
<EOS>
Now
comes
the
difference
.
 
<EOS>
If
your
father
had
not
died
when
he
did
---
Do
n't
be
frightened
!
 
<EOS>
How
you
start
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
did
,
indeed
,
start
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
caught
his
wrist
with
both
her
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
in
a
soothing
tone
,
bringing
his
left
hand
from
the
back
of
the
chair
to
lay
it
on
the
supplicatory
fingers
that
clasped
him
in
so
violent
a
tremble
:
 
<EOS>
"
pray
control
your
agitation
---
a
matter
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
was
saying
---
"
   
Her
look
so
discomposed
him
that
he
stopped
,
wandered
,
and
began
anew
:
   
<EOS>
"
As
I
was
saying
;
if
Monsieur
Manette
had
not
died
;
if
he
had
suddenly
and
silently
disappeared
;
if
he
had
been
spirited
away
;
if
it
had
not
been
difficult
to
guess
to
what
dreadful
place
,
though
no
art
could
trace
him
;
if
he
had
an
enemy
in
some
compatriot
who
could
exercise
a
privilege
that
I
in
my
own
time
have
known
the
boldest
people
afraid
to
speak
of
in
a
whisper
,
across
the
water
there
;
for
instance
,
the
privilege
of
filling
up
blank
forms
for
the
consignment
of
any
one
to
the
oblivion
of
a
prison
for
any
length
of
time
;
if
his
wife
had
implored
the
king
,
the
queen
,
the
court
,
the
clergy
,
for
any
tidings
of
him
,
and
all
quite
in
vain
;
---
then
the
history
of
your
father
would
have
been
the
history
of
this
unfortunate
gentleman
,
the
Doctor
of
Beauvais
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
entreat
you
to
tell
me
more
,
sir

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will

<EOS>
I
am
going
to

You

bear
it

<EOS>
"
I
can
bear
anything

the
uncertainty
you
leave
me
in
at
this
moment

<EOS>
"
You
speak
collectedly

you

collected

That

good

(
Though
his
manner
was
less
satisfied
than
his
words

<EOS>
"
A

Regard
it

Now

so
intensely
before
her
little
child
was
born
,
that
she
came
to
the
determination
of
sparing
the
poor
child
the
inheritance
of
any
part
of
the
agony
she
had
known
the
pains
of
,
by
rearing
her
in
the
belief
that
her
father
was
dead

<EOS>
No

do
n't
kneel

<EOS>
In
Heaven
's
name
why
should
you
kneel
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>

For
the

<EOS>
O
dear
,
good
,
compassionate
sir
,
for
the
truth
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
-
a
matter
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
You
confuse
me
,
and
how
can
I
transact
business
if
I
am
confused
?
 
<EOS>
Let
us
be
clear
-
headed
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
could
kindly
mention
now
,
for
instance
,
what
nine
times
ninepence
are
,
or
how
many
shillings
in
twenty
guineas
,
it
would
be
so
encouraging
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
so
much
more
at
my
ease
about
your
state
of
mind
.
"
   
<EOS>
Without
directly
answering
to
this
appeal
,
she
sat
so
still
when
he
had
very
gently
raised
her
,
and
the
hands
that
had
not
ceased
to
clasp
his
wrists
were
so
much
more
steady
than
they
had
been
,
that
she
communicated
some
reassurance
to
Mr
Jarvis
Lorry
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
that
's
right

Courage

Business

You

business

useful

<EOS>
Miss
Manette
,
your
mother
took
this
course
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
she
died
---
I
believe
broken
-
hearted
---
having
never
slackened
her
unavailing
search
for
your
father
,
she
left
you
,
at
two
years
old
,
to
grow
to
be
blooming
,
beautiful
,
and
happy
,
without
the
dark
cloud
upon
you
of
living
in
uncertainty
whether
your
father
soon
wore
his
heart
out
in
prison
,
or
wasted
there
through
many
lingering
years
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
said
the
words
he
looked
down
,
with
an
admiring
pity
,
on
the
flowing
golden
hair
;
as
if
he
pictured
to
himself
that
it
might
have
been
already
tinged
with
grey
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
your
parents
had
no
great
possession
,
and
that
what
they
had
was
secured
to
your
mother
and
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
There
has
been
no
new
discovery
,
of
money
,
or
of
any
other
property
;
but
---
"
   
He
felt
his
wrist
held
closer
,
and
he
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
The
expression
in
the
forehead
,
which
had
so
particularly
attracted
his
notice
,
and
which
was
now
immovable
,
had
deepened
into
one
of
pain
and
horror
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
he
has
been
-
been
found
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
alive
.
 
<EOS>
Greatly
changed
,
it
is
too
probable
;
almost
a
wreck
,
it
is
possible
;
though
we
will
hope
the
best
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
alive
.
 
<EOS>
Your
father
has
been
taken
to
the
house
of
an
old
servant
in
Paris
,
and
we
are
going
there
:
 
<EOS>
I
,
to
identify
him
if
I
can
:
 
you

to
restore
him
to
life

love

"
   
<EOS>
A
shiver
ran
through
her
frame
,
and
from
it
through
his
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
in
a
low
,
distinct
,
awe
-
stricken
voice
,
as
if
she
were
saying
it
in
a
dream
,
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
see
his
Ghost
!
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
his
Ghost
---
not
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
quietly
chafed
the
hands
that
held
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
,
there
,
there
!
 
<EOS>
See
now

see
now

<EOS>
The
best

the
worst
are
known

<EOS>
You
are
well
on

to
the
poor

,
with
a
fair
sea
voyage
,
and
a
fair
land
journey
,
you
will
be
soon
at
his
dear
side
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
repeated
in
the
same
tone
,
sunk
to
a
whisper
,
"
I
have
been
free
,
I
have
been
happy
,
yet
his
Ghost
has
never
haunted
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
one
thing
more
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
laying
stress
upon
it
as
a
wholesome
means
of
enforcing
her
attention
:
 
<EOS>
"
he
has
been
found
under
another
name
;
his
own
,
long
forgotten
or
long
concealed
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
worse
than
useless
now
to
inquire
which
;
worse
than
useless
to
seek
to
know
whether
he
has
been
for
years
overlooked
,
or
always
designedly
held
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
worse
than
useless
now
to
make
any
inquiries
,
because
it
would
be
dangerous
.
 
<EOS>
Better
not
to
mention
the
subject
,
anywhere
or
in
any
way
,
and
to
remove
him
---
for
a
while
at
all
events
---
out
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
Even
I
,
safe
as
an
Englishman
,
and
even
Tellson
's
,
important
as
they
are
to
French
credit
,
avoid
all
naming
of
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
I
carry
about
me
,
not
a
scrap
of
writing
openly
referring
to
it

<EOS>
This
is
a
secret
service
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
My
credentials
,
entries
,
and
memoranda

are
all
comprehended
in
the
one
line
,
"
Recalled

"
which
may
mean
anything
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
is
the
matter
!
 
<EOS>
She
does
n't
notice
a
word
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Manette
!
"
   
<EOS>
Perfectly
still
and
silent
,
and
not
even
fallen
back
in
her
chair
,
she
sat
under
his
hand
,
utterly
insensible
;
with
her
eyes
open
and
fixed
upon
him
,
and
with
that
last
expression
looking
as
if
it
were
carved
or
branded
into
her
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
So
close
was
her
hold
upon
his
arm
,
that
he
feared
to
detach
himself
lest
he
should
hurt
her
;
therefore
he
called
out
loudly
for
assistance
without
moving
.
   
<EOS>
A
wild
-
looking
woman
,
whom
even
in
his
agitation
,
Mr
Lorry
observed
to
be
all
of
a
red
colour
,
and
to
have
red
hair
,
and
to
be
dressed
in
some
extraordinary
tight
-
fitting
fashion
,
and
to
have
on
her
head
a
most
wonderful
bonnet
like
a
Grenadier
wooden
measure
,
and
good
measure
too
,
or
a
great
Stilton
cheese
,
came
running
into
the
room
in
advance
of
the
inn
servants
,
and
soon
settled
the
question
of
his
detachment
from
the
poor
young
lady
,
by
laying
a
brawny
hand
upon
his
chest
,
and
sending
him
flying
back
against
the
nearest
wall
.
   
<EOS>
(
"
I
really
think
this
must
be
a
man
!
"
<EOS>
was
Mr
Lorry
's
breathless
reflection
,
simultaneously
with
his
coming
against
the
wall
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
look
at
you
all
!
"
<EOS>
bawled
this
figure
,
addressing
the
inn
servants
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
go
and
fetch
things
,
instead
of
standing
there
staring
at
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
so
much
to
look
at

am
I
?
 
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
go
and
fetch
things
?
 
<EOS>
I
'll
let
you
know

if
you
do
n't
bring
smelling
-
salts
,
cold
water
,
and
vinegar
,
quick
,
I
will

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
an
immediate
dispersal
for
these
restoratives
,
and
she
softly
laid
the
patient
on
a
sofa
,
and
tended
her
with
great
skill
and
gentleness
:
 
calling
her
"
my
precious
!
"
<EOS>
and
"
my
bird
!
"
<EOS>
and
spreading
her
golden
hair
aside
over
her
shoulders
with
great
pride
and
care
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
in
brown
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
indignantly
turning
to
Mr
Lorry
;
could
n't
you
tell
her
what
you
had
to
tell
her
,
without
frightening
her
to
death
?
 
<EOS>
Look
at
her
,
with
her
pretty
pale
face
and
her
cold
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
call
THAT
being
a
Banker
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
was
so
exceedingly
disconcerted
by
a
question
so
hard
to
answer
,
that
he
could
only
look
on
,
at
a
distance
,
with
much
feebler
sympathy
and
humility
,
while
the
strong
woman
,
having
banished
the
inn
servants
under
the
mysterious
penalty
of
"
letting
them
know
"
something
not
mentioned
if
they
stayed
there
,
staring
,
recovered
her
charge
by
a
regular
series
of
gradations
,
and
coaxed
her
to
lay
her
drooping
head
upon
her
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
will
do
well
now
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
thanks
to
you
in
brown
,
if
she
does
.
 
<EOS>
My
darling
pretty
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
after
another
pause
of
feeble
sympathy
and
humility
,
"
that
you
accompany
Miss
Manette
to
France
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
likely
thing
,
too
!
"
replied
the
strong
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
it
was
ever
intended
that
I
should
go
across
salt
water
,
do
you
suppose
Providence
would
have
cast
my
lot
in
an
island
?
"
   
<EOS>
This
being
another
question
hard
to
answer
,
Mr
Jarvis
Lorry
withdrew
to
consider
it
.

Chapter

The
Wine
-
shop
 
<EOS>
A
large
cask
of
wine
had
been
dropped
and
broken
,
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
The
accident
had
happened
in
getting
it
out
of
a
cart
;
the
cask
had
tumbled
out
with
a
run
,
the
hoops
had
burst
,
and
it
lay
on
the
stones
just
outside
the
door
of
the
wine
-
shop
,
shattered
like
a
walnut
-
shell
.
   
<EOS>
All
the
people
within
reach
had
suspended
their
business
,
or
their
idleness
,
to
run
to
the
spot
and
drink
the
wine
.
 
<EOS>
The
rough
,
irregular
stones
of
the
street
,
pointing
every
way
,
and
designed
<EOS>
,
one
might
have
thought
,
expressly
to
lame
all
living
creatures
that
approached
them
,
had
dammed
it
into
little
pools
;
these
were
surrounded
,
each
by
its
own
jostling
group
or
crowd
,
according
to
its
size
.
 
<EOS>
Some
men
kneeled
down
,
made
scoops
of
their
two
hands
joined
,
and
sipped
,
or
tried
to
help
women
,
who
bent
over
their
shoulders
,
to
sip
,
before
the
wine
had
all
run
out
between
their
fingers
.
 
<EOS>
Others
,
men
and
women
,
dipped
in
the
puddles
with
little
mugs
of
mutilated
earthenware
,
or
even
with
handkerchiefs
from
women
's
heads
,
which
were
squeezed
dry
into
infants
'
mouths
;
others
made
small
mud
-
embankments
,
to
stem
the
wine
as
it
ran
;
others
,
directed
by
lookers
-
on
up
at
high
windows
,
darted
here
and
there
,
to
cut
off
little
streams
of
wine
that
started
away
in
new
directions
;
others
devoted
themselves
to
the
sodden
and
lee
-
dyed
pieces
of
the
cask
,
licking
,
and
even
champing
the
moister
wine
-
rotted
fragments
with
eager
relish
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
drainage
to
carry
off
the
wine
,
and
not
only
did
it
all
get
taken
up
,
but
so
much
mud
got
taken
up
along
with
it
,
that
there
might
have
been
a
scavenger
in
the
street
,
if
anybody
acquainted
with
it
could
have
believed
in
such
a
miraculous
presence
.
   
<EOS>
A
shrill
sound
of
laughter
and
of
amused
voices
---
voices
of
men
,
women
,
and
children
---
resounded
in
the
street
while
this
wine
game
lasted
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
little
roughness
in
the
sport
,
and
much
playfulness
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
special
companionship
in
it
,
an
observable
inclination
on
the
part
of
every
one
to
join
some
other
one
,
which
led
,
especially
among
the
luckier
or
lighter
-
hearted
,
to
frolicsome
embraces
,
drinking
of
healths
,
shaking
of
hands
,
and
even
joining
of
hands
and
dancing
,
a
dozen
together
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
wine
was
gone
,
and
the
places
where
it
had
been
most
abundant
were
raked
into
a
gridiron
-
pattern
by
fingers
,
these
demonstrations
ceased
,
as
suddenly
as
they
had
broken
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
who
had
left
his
saw
sticking
in
the
firewood
he
was
cutting
,
set
it
in
motion
again
;
the
women
who
had
left
on
a
door
-
step
the
little
pot
of
hot
ashes
,
at
which
she
had
been
trying
to
soften
the
pain
in
her
own
starved
fingers
and
toes
,
or
in
those
of
her
child
,
returned
to
it
;
men
with
bare
arms
,
matted
locks
,
and
cadaverous
faces
,
who
had
emerged
into
the
winter
light
from
cellars
,
moved
away
,
to
descend
again
;
and
a
gloom
gathered
on
the
scene
that
appeared
more
natural
to
it
than
sunshine
.
   
<EOS>
The
wine
was
red
wine
,
and
had
stained
the
ground
of
the
narrow
street
in
the
suburb
of
Saint
Antoine
,
in
Paris
,
where
it
was
spilled
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
stained
many
hands
,
too
,
and
many
faces
,
and
many
naked
feet
,
and
many
wooden
shoes
.
 
<EOS>
The
hands
of
the
man
who
sawed
the
wood
,
left
red
marks
on
the
billets
;
and
the
forehead
of
the
woman
who
nursed
her
baby
,
was
stained
with
the
stain
of
the
old
rag
she
wound
about
her
head
again
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
had
been
greedy
with
the
staves
of
the
cask
,
had
acquired
a
tigerish
smear
about
the
mouth
;
and
one
tall
joker
so
besmirched
,
his
head
more
out
of
a
long
squalid
bag
of
a
nightcap
than
in
it
,
scrawled
upon
a
wall
with
his
finger
dipped
in
muddy
wine
-
lees
---
BLOOD
.
   
<EOS>
The
time
was
to
come
,
when
that
wine
too
would
be
spilled
on
the
street
-
stones
,
and
when
the
stain
of
it
would
be
red
upon
many
there
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
that
the
cloud
settled
on
Saint
Antoine
,
which
a
momentary
gleam
had
driven
from
his
sacred
countenance
,
the
darkness
of
it
was
heavy
-
cold
,
dirt
,
sickness
,
ignorance
,
and
want
,
were
the
lords
in
waiting
on
the
saintly
presence
-
nobles
of
great
power
all
of
them
;
but
,
most
especially
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
Samples
of
a
people
that
had
undergone
a
terrible
grinding
and
regrinding
in
the
mill
,
and
certainly
not
in
the
fabulous
mill
which
ground
old
people
young
,
shivered
at
every
corner
,
passed
in
and
out
at
every
doorway
,
looked
from
every
window
,
fluttered
in
every
vestige
of
a
garment
that
the
wind
shook
.
 
<EOS>
The
mill
which
had
worked
them
down
,
was
the
mill
that
grinds
young
people
old
;
the
children
had
ancient
faces
and
grave
voices
;
and
upon
them
,
and
upon
the
grown
faces
,
and
ploughed
into
every
furrow
of
age
and
coming
up
afresh
,
was
the
sigh
,
Hunger
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
prevalent
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
Hunger
was
pushed
out
of
the
tall
houses
,
in
the
wretched
clothing
that
hung
upon
poles
and
lines
;
Hunger
was
patched
into
them
with
straw
and
rag
and
wood
and
paper
;
Hunger
was
repeated
in
every
fragment
of
the
small
modicum
of
firewood
that
the
man
sawed
off
;
Hunger
stared
down
from
the
smokeless
chimneys
,
and
started
up
from
the
filthy
street
that
had
no
offal
,
among
its
refuse
,
of
anything
to
eat
.
 
<EOS>
Hunger
was
the
inscription
on
the
baker
's
shelves
,
written
in
every
small
loaf
of
his
scanty
stock
of
bad
bread
;
at
the
sausage
-
shop
,
in
every
dead
-
dog
preparation
that
was
offered
for
sale
.
 
<EOS>
Hunger
rattled
its
dry
bones
among
the
roasting
chestnuts
in
the
turned
cylinder
;
Hunger
was
shred
into
atomics
in
every
farthing
porringer
of
husky
chips
of
potato
,
fried
with
some
reluctant
drops
of
oil
.
   
<EOS>
Its
abiding
place
was
in
all
things
fitted
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
narrow
winding
street
,
full
of
offence
and
stench
,
with
other
narrow
winding
streets
diverging
,
all
peopled
by
rags
and
nightcaps
,
and
all
smelling
of
rags
and
nightcaps
,
and
all
visible
things
with
a
brooding
look
upon
them
that
looked
ill
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
hunted
air
of
the
people
there
was
yet
some
wild
-
beast
thought
of
the
possibility
of
turning
at
bay
.
<EOS>
Depressed
and
slinking
though
they
were
,
eyes
of
fire
were
not
wanting
among
them
;
nor
compressed
lips
,
white
with
what
they
suppressed
;
nor
foreheads
knitted
into
the
likeness
of
the
gallows
-
rope
they
mused
about
enduring
,
or
inflicting
.
 
<EOS>
The
trade
signs
<EOS>
(
and
they
were
almost
as
many
as
the
shops
)
were
,
all
,
grim
illustrations
of
Want
.
 
<EOS>
The
butcher
and
the
porkman
painted
up
,
only
the
leanest
scrags
of
meat
;
the
baker
,
the
coarsest
of
meagre
loaves
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
rudely
pictured
as
drinking
in
the
wine
-
shops
,
croaked
over
their
scanty
measures
of
thin
wine
and
beer
,
and
were
gloweringly
confidential
together
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
represented
in
a
flourishing
condition
,
save
tools
and
weapons
;
but
,
the
cutler
's
knives
and
axes
were
sharp
and
bright
,
the
smith
's
hammers
were
heavy
,
and
the
gunmaker
's
stock
was
murderous
.
<EOS>
The
crippling
stones
of
the
pavement
,
with
their
many
little
reservoirs
of
mud
and
water
,
had
no
footways
,
but
broke
off
abruptly
at
the
doors
.
 
<EOS>
The
kennel
,
to
make
amends
,
ran
down
the
middle
of
the
street
---
when
it
ran
at
all
:
 
which
was
only
after
heavy
rains
,
and
then
it
ran
,
by
many
eccentric
fits
,
into
the
houses
.
 
<EOS>
Across
the
streets
,
at
wide
intervals
,
one
clumsy
lamp
was
slung
by
a
rope
and
pulley
;
at
night
,
when
the
lamplighter
had
let
these
down
,
and
lighted
,
and
hoisted
them
again
,
a
feeble
grove
of
dim
wicks
swung
in
a
sickly
manner
overhead
,
as
if
they
were
at
sea
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
they
were
at
sea
,
and
the
ship
and
crew
were
in
peril
of
tempest
.
   
<EOS>
For
,
the
time
was
to
come
,
when
the
gaunt
scarecrows
of
that
region
should
have
watched
the
lamplighter
,
in
their
idleness
and
hunger
,
so
long
,
as
to
conceive
the
idea
of
improving
on
his
method
,
and
hauling
up
men
by
those
ropes
and
pulleys
,
to
flare
upon
the
darkness
of
their
condition
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
time
was
not
come
yet
;
and
every
wind
that
blew
over
France
shook
the
rags
of
the
scarecrows
in
vain
,
for
the
birds
,
fine
of
song
and
feather
,
took
no
warning
.
   
<EOS>
The
wine
-
shop
was
a
corner
shop
,
better
than
most
others
in
its
appearance
and
degree
,
and
<EOS>
the
master
of
the
wine
-
shop
had
stood
outside
it
,
in
a
yellow
waistcoat
and
green
breeches
,
looking
on
at
the
struggle
for
the
lost
wine
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
my
affair
,
"
said
he
,
with
a
final
shrug
of
the
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
people
from
the
market
did
it
.
 
<EOS>
Ut
them
bring
another
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
,
his
eyes
happening
to
catch
the
tall
joker
writing
up
his
joke
,
he
called
to
him
across
the
way
:
   
"
<EOS>
Say
,
then
,
my
Gaspard
,
what
do
you
do
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
fellow
pointed
to
his
joke
with
immense
significance
,
as
is
often
the
way
with
his
tribe
.
 
<EOS>
It
missed
its
mark
,
and
completely
failed
,
as
is
often
the
way
with
his
tribe
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
now
?
 
<EOS>
Are
you
a
subject
for
the
mad
hospital
?
"
said
the
wine
-
shop
keeper
,
crossing
the
road
,
and
obliterating
the
jest
with
a
handful
of
mud
,
picked
up
for
the
purpose
,
and
smeared
over
it
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
write
in
the
public
streets
?
 
<EOS>
Is
there
---
tell
me
thou
---
is
there
no
other
place
to
write
such
words
in
?
"
   
<EOS>
In
his
expostulation
he
dropped
his
cleaner
hand
(
perhaps
accidentally
,
perhaps
not
)
upon
the
joker
's
heart
.
 
<EOS>
The
joker
rapped
it
with
his
own
,
took
a
nimble
spring
upward
,
and
came
down
in
a
fantastic
dancing
attitude
,
with
one
of
his
stained
shoes
jerked
off
his
foot
into
his
hand
,
and
held
out
.
 
<EOS>
A
joker
of
an
extremely
,
not
to
say
wolfishly
practical
character
,
he
looked
,
under
those
circumstances
.
   
<EOS>
"
Put
it
on
,
put
it
on
,
"
said
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Call
wine
,
wine
;
and
finish
there
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
that
advice
,
he
wiped
his
soiled
hand
upon
the
joker
's
dress
,
such
as
it
was
---
quite
deliberately
,
as
having
dirtied
the
hand
on
his
account
;
and
then
recrossed
the
road
and
entered
the
wine
-
shop
.
   
<EOS>
This
wine
-
shop
keeper
was
a
bull
-
necked
,
martial
-
looking
man
of
thirty
,
and
he
should
have
been
of
a
hot
temperament
,
for
,
although
it
was
a
bitter
day
,
he
wore
no
coat
,
but
carried
one
slung
over
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
His
shirt
-
sleeves
were
rolled
up
,
too
,
and
his
brown
arms
were
bare
to
the
elbows
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
<EOS>
did
he
wear
anything
more
on
his
head
than
his
own
crisply
-
curling
short
dark
hair
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
dark
man
altogether
,
with
good
eyes
and
a
good
bold
breadth
between
them
.
<EOS>
Good
-
humoured
looking
on
the
whole
,
but
implacable
-
looking
,
too
;
evidently
a
man
of
a
strong
resolution
and
a
set
purpose
;
a
man
not
desirable
to
be
met
,
rushing
down
a
narrow
pass
with
a
gulf
on
either
side
,
for
nothing
would
turn
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
,
his
wife
,
sat
in
the
shop
behind
the
counter
as
he
came
in
.
 
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
was
a
stout
woman
of
about
his
own
age
,
with
a
watchful
eye
that
seldom
seemed
to
look
at
anything
,
a
large
hand
heavily
ringed
,
a
steady
face
,
strong
features
,
and
great
composure
of
manner
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
character
about
Madame
Defarge
,
from
which
one
might
have
predicated
that
she
did
not
often
make
mistakes
against
herself
in
any
of
the
reckonings
over
which
she
presided
.
 
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
being
sensitive
to
cold
,
was
wrapped
in
fur
,
and
had
a
quantity
of
bright
shawl
twined
about
her
head
,
though
not
to
the
concealment
of
her
large
earrings
.
 
<EOS>
Her
knitting
was
before
her
,
but
she
had
laid
it
down
to
pick
her
teeth
with
a
toothpick
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
engaged
,
with
her
right
elbow
supported
by
her
left
hand
,
Madame
Defarge
said
nothing
when
her
lord
came
in
,
but
coughed
just
one
grain
of
cough
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
in
combination
with
the
lifting
of
her
darkly
defined
eyebrows
over
her
toothpick
by
the
breadth
of
a
line
,
suggested
to
her
husband
that
he
would
do
well
to
look
round
the
shop
among
the
customers
,
for
any
new
customer
who
had
dropped
in
while
he
stepped
over
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
The
wine
-
shop
keeper
accordingly
rolled
his
eyes
about
,
until
they
rested
upon
an
elderly
gentleman
and
a
young
lady
,
who
were
seated
in
a
corner
.
 
<EOS>
Other
company
were
there
:
 
two
playing
cards
,
two
playing
dominoes
,
three
standing
by
the
counter
lengthening
out
a
short
supply
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
passed
behind
the
counter
,
he
took
notice
that
the
elderly
gentleman
said
in
a
look
to
the
young
lady
,
"
This
is
our
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
do
YOU
do
in
that
galley
there
?
"
said
Monsieur
Defarge
to
himself
;
"
I
do
n't
know
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
,
he
feigned
not
to
notice
the
two
strangers
,
and
fell
into
discourse
with
the
triumvirate
of
customers
who
were
drinking
at
the
counter
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
goes
it
,
Jacques
?
"
said
one
of
these
three
to
Monsieur
Defarge
.
<EOS>
"
Is
all
the
spilt
wine
swallowed
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Every
drop
,
Jacques
,
"
answered
Monsieur
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
When
this
interchange
of
Christian
name
was
effected
,
Madame
Defarge
,
picking
her
teeth
with
her
toothpick
,
coughed
another
grain
of
cough
,
and
raised
her
eyebrows
by
the
breadth
of
another
line
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
often
,
"
said
the
second
of
the
three
,
addressing
Monsieur
Defarge
,
"
that
many
of
these
miserable
beasts
know
the
taste
of
wine
,
or
of
anything
but
black
bread
and
death
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
so
,
Jacques
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
,
Jacques
,
"
Monsieur
Defarge
returned
.
   
<EOS>
At
this
second
interchange
of
the
Christian
name
,
Madame
Defarge
,
still
using
her
toothpick
with
profound
composure
,
coughed
another
grain
of
cough
,
and
raised
her
eyebrows
by
the
breadth
of
another
line
.
   
<EOS>
The
last
of
the
three
now
said
his
say
,
as
he
put
down
his
empty
drinking
vessel
and
smacked
his
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
So
much
the
worse
!
 
<EOS>
A
bitter
taste
<EOS>
it
is
that
such
poor
cattle
always
have
in
their
mouths
,
and
hard
lives
they
live
,
Jacques
.
<EOS>
Am
I
right
,
Jacques
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
Jacques
,
"
was
the
response
of
Monsieur
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
This
third
interchange
of
the
Christian
name
was
completed
at
the
moment
when
Madame
Defarge
put
her
toothpick
by
,
kept
her
eyebrows
up
,
and
slightly
rustled
in
her
seat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
then
!
 
<EOS>
True
!
<EOS>
"
muttered
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
---
my
wife
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
three
customers
pulled
off
their
hats
to
Madame
Defarge
,
with
three
flourishes
.
 
<EOS>
She
acknowledged
their
homage
by
bending
her
head
,
and
giving
them
a
quick
look
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
glanced
in
a
casual
manner
<EOS>
round
the
wine
-
shop
,
took
up
her
knitting
with
great
apparent
calmness
and
repose
of
spirit
,
and
became
absorbed
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
said
her
husband
,
who
had
kept
his
bright
eye
observantly
upon
her
,
"
good
day
.
 
<EOS>
The
chamber
,
furnished
bachelor
-
fashion
,
that
you
wished
to
see
,
and
were
inquiring
for
when
I
stepped
out
,
is
on
the
fifth
floor
.
 
<EOS>
The
doorway
of
the
staircase
gives
on
the
little
courtyard
close
to
the
left
here
,
"
pointing
with
his
hand
,
"
near
to
the
window
of
my
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
now
that
I
remember
,
one
of
you
has
already
been
there
,
and
can
show
the
way
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
adieu
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
paid
for
their
wine
,
and
left
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
The
eyes
of
Monsieur
Defarge
were
studying
his
wife
at
her
knitting
when
the
elderly
gentleman
advanced
from
his
corner
,
and
begged
the
favour
of
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
Willingly
,
sir
,
"
said
Monsieur
Defarge
,
and
quietly
stepped
with
him
to
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
Their
conference
was
very
short
,
but
very
decided
.
 
<EOS>
Almost
at
the
first
word
,
Monsieur
Defarge
started
and
became
deeply
attentive
.
<EOS>
It
had
not
lasted
a
minute
,
when
he
nodded
and
went
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
then
beckoned
to
the
young
lady
,
and
they
,
too
,
went
out
.
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
knitted
with
nimble
fingers
and
steady
eyebrows
,
and
saw
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jarvis
Lorry
and
Miss
Manette
,
emerging
from
the
wine
-
shop
thus
,
joined
Monsieur
Defarge
in
the
doorway
to
which
he
had
directed
his
own
company
just
before
.
 
<EOS>
It
opened
from
a
stinking
little
black
courtyard
,
and
was
the
general
public
entrance
to
a
great
pile
of
houses
,
inhabited
by
a
great
number
of
people
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
gloomy
tile
-
paved
entry
to
the
gloomy
tile
-
paved
staircase
,
Monsieur
Defarge
bent
down
on
one
knee
to
the
child
of
his
old
master
,
and
put
her
hand
to
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
gentle
action
,
but
not
at
all
gently
done
;
a
very
remarkable
transformation
had
come
over
him
in
a
few
seconds
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
good
-
humour
in
his
face
,
nor
any
openness
of
aspect
left
,
but
had
become
a
secret
,
angry
,
dangerous
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
high
;
it
is
a
little
difficult
.
 
<EOS>
Better
to
begin
slowly
.
"
<EOS>
Thus
,
Monsieur
Defarge
,
in
a
stem
voice
,
to
Mr
Lorry
,
as
they
began
ascending
the
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
alone
?
"
<EOS>
the
latter
whispered
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alone
!
 
<EOS>
God
help
him
,
who
should
be
with
him
!
"
said
the
other
,

the

low
voice

<EOS>
"
Is
he
always
alone
,
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
his
own
desire
?
"
   
"
Of
his
own
necessity
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
was
,
when
I
first
saw
him
after
they
found
me
and
demanded
to
know
if
I
would
take
him
,
and
,
at
my
peril
be
discreet
---
as
he
was
then
,
so
he
is
now
.

<EOS>

He
is
greatly
changed

Changed

The
keeper
of
the
wine
-
shop
stopped
to
strike
the
wall
with
his
hand
,
and
mutter
a
tremendous
curse
.
 
<EOS>
No
direct
answer
could
have
been
half
so
forcible
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
's
spirits
grew
heavier
and
heavier
,
as
he
and
his
two
companions
ascended
higher
and
higher
.
   
<EOS>
Such
a
staircase
,
with
its
accessories
,
in
the
older
and
more
crowded
parts
of
Paris
,
would
be
bad
enough
now
;
but
,
at
that
time
,
it
was
vile
indeed
to
unaccustomed
and
unhardened
senses
.
 
<EOS>
Every
little
habitation
within
the
great
foul
nest
of
one
high
building
<EOS>
---
that
is
to
say
,
the
room
or
rooms
within
every
door
that
opened
on
the
general
staircase
---
left
its
own
heap
of
refuse
on
its
own
landing
,
besides
flinging
other
refuse
from
its
own
windows
.
 
<EOS>
The
uncontrollable
and
hopeless
mass
of
decomposition
<EOS>
so
engendered
,
would
have
polluted
the
air
,
even
if
poverty
and
deprivation
had
not
loaded
it
with
their
intangible
impurities
;
the
two
bad
sources
combined
made
it
almost
insupportable
.
 
<EOS>
Through
such
an
atmosphere
,
by
a
steep
dark
shaft
of
dirt
and
poison
,
the
way
lay
.
 
<EOS>
Yielding
to
his
own
disturbance
of
mind
,
and
to
his
young
companion
's
agitation
,
which
became
greater
every
instant
,
Mr
Jarvis
Lorry
twice
stopped
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Each
of
these
stoppages
was
made
at
a
doleful
grating
,
by
which
any
languishing
good
airs
that
were
left
uncorrupted
,
seemed
to
escape
,
and
all
spoilt
and
sickly
vapours
seemed
to
crawl
in
.
 
<EOS>
Through
the
rusted
bars
,
tastes
,
rather
than
glimpses
,
were
caught
of
the
jumbled
neighbourhood
;
and
nothing
within
range
,
nearer
or
lower
than
the
summits
of
the
two
great
towers
of
Notre
-
Dame
,
had
any
promise
on
it
of
healthy
life
or
wholesome
aspirations
.
   
<EOS>
At
last
,
the
top
of
the
staircase
was
gained
,
and
they
stopped
for
the
third
time
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
yet
an
upper
staircase
,
of
a
steeper
inclination
and
of
contracted
dimensions
,
to
be
ascended
,
before
the
garret
story
was
reached
.
 
<EOS>
The
keeper
of
the
wine
-
shop
,
always
going
a
little
in
advance
,
and
always
going
on
the
side
which
Mr
Lorry
took
,
as
though
he
dreaded
to
be
asked
any
question
by
the
young
lady
,
turned
himself
about
here
,
and
,
carefully
feeling
in
the
pockets
of
the
coat
he
carried
over
his
shoulder
,
took
out
a
key
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
door
is
locked
then
,
my
friend
?
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
surprised
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ay
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
was
the
grim
reply
of
Monsieur
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
think
it
necessary
to
keep
the
unfortunate
gentleman
so
retired
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
necessary
to
turn
the
key
.
"
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
Defarge
whispered
it
closer
in
his
ear
,
and
frowned
heavily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
!
 
<EOS>
Because
he
has
lived
so
long
,
locked
up
,
that
he
would
be
frightened
-
rave
-
tear
himself
to
pieces
<EOS>
-
die
-
come
to
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
harm
---
if
his
door
was
left
open
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mr
Lorry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Defarge
,
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
And
a
beautiful
world
we
live
in
,
when
it
IS
possible
,
and
when
many
other
such
things
are
possible
,
and
not
only
possible
,
but
done
---
done
,
see
you
!
<EOS>
---
under
that
sky
there
,
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
Long
live
the
Devil
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
go
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
dialogue
had
been
held
in
so
very
low
a
whisper
,
that
not
a
word
of
it
had
reached
the
young
lady
's
ears
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
by
this
time
she
trembled
under
such
strong
emotion
,
and
her
face
expressed
such
deep
anxiety
,
and
,
above
all
,
such
dread
and
terror
,
that
Mr
Lorry
felt
it
incumbent
on
him
to
speak
a
word
or
two
of
reassurance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Courage
,
dear
miss
!
 
<EOS>
Courage

<EOS>
Business

<EOS>
The
worst
will
be
over
in
a
moment
;
it
is
but
passing
the
room

door
,
and
the
worst
is
over
.
<EOS>
Then
,
all
the
good
you
bring
to
him
,
all
the
relief
,
all
the
happiness
you
bring
to
him
,
begin

<EOS>
Let
our
good

here

assist
you
on

That

Come

Business

"
   
<EOS>
They
went
up
slowly
and
softly
.
 
<EOS>
The
staircase
was
short
,
and
they
were
soon
at
the
top
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
as
it
had
an
abrupt
turn
in
it
,
they
came
all
at
once
in
sight
of
three
men
,
whose
heads
were
bent
down
close
together
at
the
side
of
a
door
,
and
who
were
intently
looking
into
the
room
to
which
the
door
belonged
,
through
some
chinks
or
holes
in
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
On
hearing
footsteps
close
at
hand
,
these
three
turned
,
and
rose
,
and
showed
themselves
to
be
the
three
of
one
name
who
had
been
drinking
in
the
wine
-
shop
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
forgot
them
in
the
surprise
of
your
visit
,
"
explained
Monsieur
Defarge
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
us
,
good
boys
;
we
have
business
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
three
glided
by
,
and
went
silently
down
.
   
<EOS>
There
appearing
to
be
no
other
door
on
that
floor
,
and
the
keeper
of
the
wine
-
shop
going
straight
to
this
one
when
they
were
left
alone
,
Mr
Lorry
asked
him
in
a
whisper
,
with
a
little
anger
:
   
"
Do
you
make
a
show
of
Monsieur
Manette
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
show
him
,
in
the
way
you
have
seen
,
to
a
chosen
few
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
\I\
think
it
is
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
are
the
few
?
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
choose
them
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
choose
them
as
real
men
,
of
my
name
---
<EOS>
Jacques
is
my
name
---
to
whom
the
sight
is
likely
to
do
good
.
 
<EOS>
Enough
;
you
are
English
;
that
is
another
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
there
,
if
you
please
,
a
little
moment
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
an
admonitory
gesture
to
keep
them
back
,
he
stooped
,
and
looked
in
through
the
crevice
in
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
raising
his
head
again
,
he
struck
twice
or
thrice
upon
the
door
---
evidently
with
no
other
object
than
to
make
a
noise
there
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
same
intention
,
he
drew
the
key
across
it
,
three
or
four
times
,
before
he
put
it
clumsily
into
the
lock
,
and
turned
it
as
heavily
as
he
could
.
   
<EOS>
The
door
slowly
opened
inward
under
his
hand
,
and
he
looked
into
the
room
and
said
something
.
 
<EOS>
A
faint
voice
answered
something
.
 
<EOS>
Little
more
than
a
single
syllable
could
have
been
spoken
on
either
side
.
   
<EOS>
He
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
,
and
beckoned
them
to
enter
.
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
got
his
arm
securely
round
the
daughter
's
waist
,
and
held
her
;
for
he
felt
that
she
was
sinking
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
-
a
-
a
-
business
,
business
!
"
<EOS>
he
urged
,
with
a
moisture
that
was
not
of
business
shining
on
his
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
come
in
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
of
it
,
"
she
answered
,
shuddering
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
it
?
 
<EOS>
What
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Of
my
father
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rendered
in
a
manner
desperate
,
by
her
state
and
<EOS>
by
the
beckoning
of
their
conductor
,
he
drew
over
his
neck
the
arm
that
shook
upon
his
shoulder
,
lifted
her
a
little
,
and
hurried
her
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
her
down
just
within
the
door
,
and
held
her
,
clinging
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
Defarge
drew
out
the
key
,
closed
the
door
,
locked
it
on
the
inside
,
took
out
the
key
again
,
and
held
it
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
he
did
,
methodically
,
and
with
as
loud
and
harsh
an
accompaniment
of
noise
as
he
could
make
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
he
walked
across
the
room
with
a
measured
tread
to
where
the
window
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
stopped
there
,
and
faced
round
.
   
<EOS>
The
garret
,
built
to
be
a
depository
for
firewood
and
the
like
,
was
dim
and
dark
:
 
for
,
the
window
of
dormer
shape
,
was
in
truth
a
door
in
the
roof
,
with
a
little
crane
over
it
for
the
hoisting
up
of
stores
from
the
street
:
 
unglazed
,
and
closing
up
the
middle
in
two
pieces
,
like
any
other
door
of
French
construction
.
 
<EOS>
To
exclude
the
cold
,
one
half
of
this
door
was
fast
closed
,
and
the
other
was
opened
but
a
very
little
way
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
scanty
portion
of
light
was
admitted
through
these
means
,
that
it
was
difficult
,
on
first
coming
in
,
to
see
anything
;
and
long
habit
alone
could
have
slowly
formed
in
any
one
,
the
ability
to
do
any
work
requiring
nicety
in
such
obscurity
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
work
of
that
kind
was
being
done
in
the
garret
;
for
,
with
his
back
towards
the
door
,
and
his
face
towards
the
window
where
the
keeper
of
the
wine
-
shop
stood
looking
at
him
,
a
white
-
haired
man
sat
on
a
low
bench
,
stooping
forward
and
very
busy
,
making
shoes
.

<EOS>
The
Shoemaker
 
"
Good
day
!
"
said
Monsieur
Defarge
,
looking
down
at
the
white
head
that
bent
low
over
the
shoemaking
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
raised
for
a
moment
,
and
a
very
faint
voice
responded
to
the
salutation
,
as
if
it
were
at
a
distance
:
   
<EOS>
"
Good
day
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
still
hard
at
work
,
I
see
?
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
long
silence
,
the
head
was
lifted
for
another
moment
,
and
the
voice
replied
,
"
Yes
---
I
am
working
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
time
,
a
pair
of
haggard
eyes
had
looked
at
the
questioner
,
before
the
face
had
dropped
again
.
   
<EOS>
The
faintness
of
the
voice
was
pitiable
and
dreadful
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
faintness
of
physical
weakness
,
though
confinement
and
hard
fare
<EOS>
no
doubt
had
their
part
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Its
deplorable
peculiarity
was
,
that
it
was
the
faintness
of
solitude
and
disuse
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
like
the
last
feeble
echo
of
a
sound
made
long
and
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
So
entirely
had
it
lost
the
life
and
resonance
of
the
human
voice
,
that
it
affected
the
senses
like
a
once
beautiful
colour
faded
away
into
a
poor
weak
stain
.
 
<EOS>
So
sunken
and
suppressed
it
was
,
that
it
was
like
a
voice
underground
.
 
<EOS>
So
expressive
it
was
,
of
a
hopeless
and
lost
creature
,
that
a
famished
traveller
,
wearied
out
by
lonely
wandering
in
a
wilderness
,
would
have
remembered
home
and
friends
in
such
a
tone
before
lying
down
to
die
.
   
<EOS>
Some
minutes
of
silent
work
had
passed
:
 
and
the
haggard
eyes
had
looked
up
again
:
 
not
with
any
interest
or
curiosity
,
but
with
a
dull
mechanical
perception
,
beforehand
,
that
the
spot
where
the
only
visitor
they
were
aware
of
had
stood
,
was
not
yet
empty
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
,
"
said
Defarge
,
who
had
not
removed
his
gaze
from
the
shoemaker
,
"
to
let
in
a
little
more
light
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
bear
a
little
more
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
shoemaker
stopped
his
work
;
looked
with
a
vacant
air
of
listening
,
at
the
floor
on
one
side
of
him
;
then
similarly
,
at
the
floor
on
the
other
side
of
him
;
then
,
upward
at
the
speaker
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
bear
a
little
more
light
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
bear
it
,
if
you
let
it
in
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
Laying
the
palest
shadow
of
a
stress
upon
the
second
word
.
)
   
<EOS>
The
opened
half
-
door
was
opened
a
little
further
,
and
secured
at
that
angle
for
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
A
broad
ray
of
light
fell
into
the
garret
,
and
showed
the
workman
with
an
unfinished
shoe
upon
his
lap
,
pausing
in
his
labour
.
 
<EOS>
His
few
common
tools
and
various
scraps
of
leather
were
at
his
feet
and
on
his
bench
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
white
beard
,
raggedly
cut
,
but
not
very
long
,
a
hollow
face
,
and
exceedingly
bright
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
The
hollowness
and
thinness
of
his
face
would
have
caused
them
to
look
large
,
under
his
yet
dark
eyebrows
and
his
confused
white
hair
,
though
they
had
been
really
otherwise
;
but
,
they
were
naturally
large
,
and
looked
unnaturally
so
.
 
<EOS>
His
yellow
rags
of
shirt
lay
open
at
the
throat
,
and
showed
his
body
to
be
withered
and
worn
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
and
his
old
canvas
frock
,
and
his
loose
stockings
,
and
all
his
poor
tatters
of
clothes
,
had
,
in
a
long
seclusion
from
direct
light
and
air
,
faded
down
to
such
a
dull
uniformity
of
parchment
-
yellow
,
that
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
which
was
which
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
put
up
a
hand
between
his
eyes
and
the
light
,
and
the
very
bones
of
it
seemed
transparent
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
sat
,
with
a
steadfastly
vacant
gaze
,
pausing
in
his
work
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
looked
at
the
figure
before
him
,
without
first
looking
down
on
this
side
of
himself
,
then
on
that
,
as
if
he
had
lost
the
habit
of
associating
place
with
sound
;
he
never
spoke
,
without
first
wandering
in
this
manner
,
and
forgetting
to
speak
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
finish
that
pair
of
shoes
to
-
day
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Defarge
,
motioning
to
Mr
Lorry
to
come
forward
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
finish
that
pair
of
shoes
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
that
I
mean
to
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
But
,
the
question
reminded
him
of
his
work
,
and
he
bent
over
it
again
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
came
silently
forward
,
leaving
the
daughter
by
the
door
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
stood
,
for
a
minute
or
two
,
by
the
side
of
Defarge
,
the
shoemaker
looked
up
.
 
<EOS>
He
showed
no
surprise
at
seeing
another
figure
,
but
the
unsteady
fingers
of
one
of
his
hands
strayed
to
his
lips
as
he
looked
at
it
<EOS>
(
his
lips
and
his
nails
were
of
the
same
pale
lead
-
colour
)
,
and
then
the
hand
dropped
to
his
work
,
and
he
once
more
bent
over
the
shoe
.
 
<EOS>
The
look
and
the
action
had
occupied
but
an
instant
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
visitor
,
you
see
,
"
said
Monsieur
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
is
a
visitor
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
shoemaker
looked
up
as
before
,
but
without
removing
a
hand
from
his
work
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
said
Defarge
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
is
monsieur
,
who
knows
a
well
-
made
shoe
when
he
sees
one
.
 
<EOS>
Show
him
that
shoe
you
are
working
at
.
 
<EOS>
Take
it
,
monsieur
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
took
it
in
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
monsieur
what
kind
of
shoe
it
is
,
and
the
maker
's
name
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
longer
pause
than
usual
,
before
the
shoemaker
replied
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
forget
what
it
was
you
asked
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
could
n't
you
describe
the
kind
of
shoe
,
for
monsieur
's
information
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
lady
's
shoe
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
young
lady
's
walking
-
shoe
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
in
the
present
mode
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
the
mode
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
a
pattern
in
my
hand
.
"
<EOS>
He
glanced
at
the
shoe
with
some
little
passing
touch
of
pride
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
maker
's
name
?
"
said
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
Now
that
he
had
no
work
to
hold
,
he
laid
the
knuckles
of
the
right
hand
in
the
hollow
of
the
left
,
and
then
the
knuckles
of
the
left
hand
in
the
hollow
of
the
right
,
and
then
passed
a
hand
across
his
bearded
chin
,
and
so
on
in
regular
changes
,
without
a
moment
's
intermission
.
<EOS>
The
task
of
recalling
him
from
the
vagrancy
into
which
he
always
sank
when
he
had
spoken
,
was
like
recalling
some
very
weak
person
from
a
swoon
,
or
endeavouring
,
in
the
hope
of
some
disclosure
,
to
stay
the
spirit
of
a
fast
-
dying
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ask
me
for
my
name
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Assuredly
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
One
Hundred
and
Five
,
North
Tower
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
One
Hundred
and
Five
,
North
Tower
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
a
weary
sound
that
was
not
a
sigh
,
nor
a
groan
,
he
bent
to
work
again
,
until
the
silence
was
again
broken
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
a
shoemaker
by
trade
?
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
looking
steadfastly
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
His
haggard
eyes
turned
to
Defarge
as
if
he
would
have
transferred
the
question
to
him
:
 
but
as
no
help
came
from
that
quarter
,
they
turned
back
on
the
questioner
when
they
had
sought
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
a
shoemaker
by
trade
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
was
not
a
shoemaker
by
trade
.
<EOS>
I
-
<EOS>
I
learnt
it
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
taught
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
leave
to
---
"
   
He
lapsed
away
,
even
for
minutes
,
ringing
those
measured
changes
on
his
hands
the
whole
time
.
 
<EOS>
His
eyes
came
slowly
back
,
at
last
,
to
the
face
from
which
they
had
wandered
;
when
they
rested
on
it
,
he
started
,
and
resumed
,
in
the
manner
of
a
sleeper
that
moment
awake
,
reverting
to
a
subject
of
last
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
asked
leave
to
teach
myself
,
and
I
got
it
with
much
difficulty
after
a
long
while
,
and
I
have
made
shoes
ever
since
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
held
out
his
hand
for
the
shoe
that
had
been
taken
from
him
,
Mr
Lorry
said
,
still
looking
steadfastly
in
his
face
:
   
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
Manette
,
do
you
remember
nothing
of
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
shoe
dropped
to
the
ground
,
and
he
sat
looking
fixedly
at
the
questioner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
Manette
"
<EOS>
;
Mr
Lorry
laid
his
hand
upon
Defarge
's
arm
;
"
do
you
remember
nothing
of
this
man
?
 
<EOS>
Look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
me
.
<EOS>
Is
there
no
old
banker
,
no
old
business
,
no
old
servant
,
no
old
time
,
rising
in
your
mind
,
Monsieur
Manette
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
captive
of
many
years
sat
looking
fixedly
,
by
turns
,
at
Mr
Lorry
and
at
Defarge
,
some
long
obliterated
marks
of
an
actively
intent
intelligence
in
the
middle
of
the
forehead
,
gradually
forced
themselves
through
the
black
mist
that
had
fallen
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
overclouded
again
<EOS>
,
they
were
fainter
,
they
were
gone
;
but
they
had
been
there
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
exactly
was
the
expression
repeated
on
the
fair
young
face
of
her
who
had
crept
along
the
wall
to
a
point
where
she
could
see
him
,
and
where
she
now
stood
looking
at
him
,
with
hands
which
at
first
had
been
only
raised
in
frightened
compassion
,
if
not
even
to
keep
him
off
and
shut
out
the
sight
of
him
,
but
which
were
now
extending
towards
him
,
trembling
with
eagerness
to
lay
the
spectral
face
upon
her
warm
young
breast
,
and
love
it
back
to
life
and
hope
---
<EOS>
so
exactly
was
the
expression
repeated
(
though
in
stronger
characters
)
on
her
fair
young
face
,
that
it
looked
as
though
it
had
passed
like
a
moving
light
,
from
him
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
Darkness
had
fatten
on
him
in
its
place
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
the
two
,
less
and
less
attentively
,
and
his
eyes
in
gloomy
abstraction
sought
the
ground
and
looked
about
him
in
the
old
way
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
with
a
deep
long
sigh
,
he
took
the
shoe
up
,
and
resumed
his
work
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
recognised
him
,
monsieur
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Defarge
in
a
whisper
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
I
thought
it
quite
hopeless
,
but
I
have
unquestionably
seen
,
for
a
single
moment
,
the
face
that
I
once
knew
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
Let
us
draw
further
back
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
had
moved
from
the
wall
of
the
garret
,
very
near
to
the
bench
on
which
he
sat
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
something
awful
in
his
unconsciousness
of
the
figure
that
could
have
put
out
its
hand
and
touched
him
as
he
stooped
over
his
labour
.
   
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
spoken
,
not
a
sound
was
made
.
 
<EOS>
She
stood
,
like
a
spirit
,
beside
him
,
and
he
bent
over
his
work
.
   
<EOS>
It
happened
,
at
length
,
that
he
had
occasion
to
change
the
instrument
in
his
hand
,
for
his
shoemaker
's
knife
.
 
<EOS>
It
lay
on
that
side
of
him
which
was
not
the
side
on
which
she
stood
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
taken
it
up
,
and
was
stooping
to
work
again
,
when
his
eyes
caught
the
skirt
of
her
dress
.
 
<EOS>
He
raised
them
,
and
saw
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
spectators
started
forward
,
but
she
stayed
them
with
a
motion
of
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
no
fear
of
his
striking
at
her
with
the
knife
,
though
they
had
.
   
<EOS>
He
stared
at
her
with
a
fearful
look
,
and
after
a
while
his
lips
began
to
form
some
words
,
though
no
sound
proceeded
from
them
.
 
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
in
the
pauses
of
his
quick
and
laboured
breathing
,
he
was
heard
to
say
:
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
With
the
tears
streaming
down
her
face
,
she
put
her
two
hands
to
her
lips
,
and
kissed
them
to
him
;
then
clasped
them
on
her
breast
,
as
if
she
laid
his
ruined
head
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
the
gaoler
's
daughter
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
sighed
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Not
yet
trusting
the
tones
of
her
voice
,
she
sat
down
on
the
bench
beside
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
recoiled
,
but
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
A
strange
thrill
struck
him
when
she
did
so
,
and
visibly
passed
over
his
frame
;
he
laid
the
knife
down
'
softly
,
as
he
sat
staring
at
her
.
   
<EOS>
Her
golden
hair
,
which
she
wore
in
long
curls
,
had
been
hurriedly
pushed
aside
,
and
fell
down
over
her
neck
.
 
<EOS>
Advancing
his
hand
by
little
and
little
,
he
took
it
up
and
looked
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
the
action
he
went
astray
,
and
,
with
another
deep
sigh
,
fell
to
work
at
his
shoemaking
.
   
<EOS>
But
not
for
long
.
 
<EOS>
Releasing
his
arm
,
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
After
looking
doubtfully
at
it
,
two
or
three
times
,
as
if
to
be
sure
that
it
was
really
there
,
he
laid
down
his
work
,
put
his
hand
to
his
neck
,
and
took
off
a
blackened
string
with
a
scrap
of
folded
rag
attached
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
opened
this
,
carefully
,
on
his
knee
,
and
it
contained
a
very
little
quantity
of
hair
:
 
not
more
than
one
or
two
long
golden
hairs
,
which
he
had
,
in
some
old
day
,
wound
off
upon
his
finger
.
   
<EOS>
He
took
her
hair
into
his
hand
again
,
and
looked
closely
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
How
can
it
be
!
 
<EOS>
When
was
it
!
 
<EOS>
How
was
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
concentrated
expression
returned
to
his
forehead
,
he
seemed
to
become
conscious
that
it
was
in
hers
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
her
full
to
the
light
,
and
looked
at
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
had
laid
her
head
upon
my
shoulder
,
that
night
when
I
was
summoned
out
---
she
had
a
fear
of
my
going
,
though
I
had
none
---
and
<EOS>
when
I
was
brought
to
the
North
Tower
they
found
these
upon
my
sleeve
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
leave
me
them
?
 
<EOS>
They
can
never
help
me
to
escape
in
the
body
,
though
they
may
in
the
spirit
.
<EOS>
"
Those
were
the
words
I
said
.
<EOS>
I
remember
them
very
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
formed
this
speech
with
his
lips
many
times
before
he
could
utter
it
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
did
find
spoken
words
for
it
,
they
came
to
him
coherently
,
though
slowly
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
was
this
?
<EOS>
---
WAS
IT
YOU
?
"
   
<EOS>
Once
more
,
the
two
spectators
started
,
as
he
turned
upon
her
with
a
frightful
suddenness
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
sat
perfectly
still
in
his
grasp
,
and
only
said
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
I
entreat
you
,
good
gentlemen
,
do
not
come
near
us
,
do
not
speak
,
do
not
move
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whose
voice
was
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
His
hands
released
her
as
he
uttered
this
cry
,
and
went
up
to
his
white
hair
,
which
they
tore
in
a
frenzy
.
 
<EOS>
It
died
out
,
as
everything
but
his
shoemaking
did
die
out
of
him
,
and
he
refolded
his
little
packet
and
tried
to
secure
it
in
his
breast
;
but
he
still
looked
at
her
,
and
gloomily
shook
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
no
;
you
are
too
young
,
too
blooming
.
 
<EOS>
It
ca
n't
be
.
 
<EOS>
See
what
the
prisoner
is
.
 
<EOS>
These
are
not
the
hands
she
knew
,
this
is
not
the
face
she
knew
,
this
is
not
a
voice
she
ever
heard
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
---
and
He
was
---
before
the
slow
years
of
the
North
Tower
---
<EOS>
ages
ago
.
<EOS>
What
is
your
name
,
my
gentle
angel
?
"
   
<EOS>
Hailing
his
softened
tone
and
manner
,
his
daughter
fell
upon
her
knees
before
him
,
with
her
appealing
hands
upon
his
breast
.
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
sir
,
at
another
time

His
cold
white
head
mingled
with
her
radiant
hair
,
which
warmed
and
lighted
it
as
though
it
were
the
light
of
Freedom
shining
on
him
.

If
you

it
is

you
hear

any

a

once

sweet

anything

you

where
I
will
be
true
to
you

all
my

I
bring
back
the
remembrance

a

long
desolate

your

pined
away

weep
for

<EOS>
She
held
him
closer
round
the
neck
,
and
rocked
him
on
her
breast
like
a
child
.
   
<EOS>

<EOS>
If

when
I
tell
you

dearest

that
your
agony
is
over

and
that
I
have
come
here
to
take
you
from
it
,
and
that
we
go
to
England
to
be
at
peace

at
rest

I
cause
you
to
think

your

laid
waste

of
our

so
wicked
to
you

is
living

kneel
to
my
honoured

implore
his
pardon

having
never
for

striven
all

awake

all

Good

"
   
<EOS>
He
had
sunk
in
her
arms
,
and
his
face
dropped
on
her
breast
:
 
a
sight
so
touching
,
yet
so
terrible
in
the
tremendous
wrong
and
suffering
which
had
gone
before
it
,
that
the
two
beholders
covered
their
faces
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
quiet
of
the
garret
had
been
long
undisturbed
,
and
his
heaving
breast
and
shaken
form
had
long
yielded
to
the
calm
that
must
follow
all
storms
---
<EOS>
emblem
to
humanity
,
of
the
rest
and
silence
into
which
the
storm
called
Life
must
hush
at
last
---
they
came
forward
to
raise
the
father
and
daughter
from
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
gradually
dropped
to
the
floor
,
and
lay
there
in
a
lethargy
,
worn
out
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
nestled
down
with
him
,
that
his
head
might
lie
upon
her
arm
;
and
her
hair
drooping
over
him
curtained
him
from
the
light
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
,
without
disturbing
him
,
"
she
said
,
raising
her
hand
to
Mr
Lorry
as
he
stooped
over
them
,
after
repeated
blowings
of
his
nose
,
"
all
could
be
arranged
for
our
leaving
Paris
at
once
,
so
that
,
from
the
,
very
door
,
he
could
be
taken
away
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
But
,
consider
.
 
<EOS>
Is
he
fit
for
the
journey
?
"
asked
Mr
Lorry
.
   
<EOS>
"
More
fit
for
that
,
I
think
,
than
to
remain
in
this
city
,
so
dreadful
to
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
,
"
said
Defarge
,
who
was
kneeling
to
look
on
and
hear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
More
than
that
;
Monsieur
Manette
is
,
for
all
reasons
,
best
out
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
Say
,
shall
I
hire
a
carriage
and
post
-
horses
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
business
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
resuming
on
the
shortest
notice
his
methodical
manners
;
"
and
if
business
is
to
be
done
,
I
had
better
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
be
so
kind
,
"
urged
Miss
Manette
,
"
as
to
leave
us
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
how
composed
he
has
become
,
and
you
can
not
be
afraid
to
leave
him
with
me
now
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
you
be
?
 
<EOS>
If
you
will
lock
the
door
to
secure
us
from
interruption
,
I
do
not
doubt
that
you
will
find
him
,
when
you
come
back
,
as
quiet
as
you
leave
him
.
 
<EOS>
In
any
case
,
I
will
take
care
of
him
until
you
return
,
and
then
we
will
remove
him
straight
.
"
   
<EOS>
Both
Mr
Lorry
and
Defarge
were
rather
disinclined
to
this
course
,
and
in
favour
of
one
of
them
remaining
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
there
were
not
only
carriage
and
horses
to
be
seen
to
,
but
travelling
papers
;
and
as
time
pressed
,
for
the
day
was
drawing
to
an
end
,
it
came
at
last
to
their
hastily
dividing
the
business
that
was
necessary
to
be
done
,
and
hurrying
away
to
do
it
.
   
<EOS>
Then
,
as
the
darkness
closed
in
,
the
daughter
laid
her
head
down
on
the
hard
ground
close
at
the
father
's
side
,
and
watched
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
darkness
deepened
and
deepened
,
and
they
both
lay
quiet
,
until
a
light
gleamed
through
the
chinks
in
the
wall
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
and
Monsieur
Defarge
had
made
all
ready
for
the
journey
,
and
had
brought
with
them
,
besides
travelling
cloaks
and
wrappers
,
bread
and
meat
,
wine
,
and
hot
coffee
.
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
Defarge
put
this
provender
,
and
the
lamp
he
carried
,
on
the
shoemaker
's
bench
<EOS>
(
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
garret
but
a
pallet
bed
)
,
and
he
and
Mr
Lorry
roused
the
captive
,
and
assisted
him
to
his
feet
.
   
<EOS>
No
human
intelligence
could
have
read
the
mysteries
of
his
mind
,
in
the
scared
blank
wonder
of
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
he
knew
what
had
happened
,
whether
he
recollected
what
they
had
said
to
him
,
whether
he
knew
that
he
was
free
,
were
questions
which
no
sagacity
could
have
solved
.
 
<EOS>
They
tried
speaking
to
him
;
but
,
he
was
so
confused
,
and
so
very
slow
to
answer
,
that
they
took
fright
at
his
bewilderment
,
and
agreed
for
the
time
to
tamper
with
him
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
wild
,
lost
manner
of
occasionally
clasping
his
head
in
his
hands
,
<EOS>
that
had
not
been
seen
in
him
before
;
yet
,
he
had
some
pleasure
in
the
mere
sound
of
his
daughter
's
voice
,
and
invariably
turned
to
it
when
she
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
submissive
way
of
one
long
accustomed
to
obey
under
coercion
,
he
ate
and
drank
what
they
gave
him
to
eat
and
drink
,
and
put
on
the
cloak
and
other
wrappings
,
that
they
gave
him
to
wear
.
 
<EOS>
He
readily
responded
to
his
daughter
's
drawing
her
arm
through
his
,
and
took
---
and
kept
---
her
hand
in
both
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
They
began
to
descend
;
Monsieur
Defarge
going
first
with
the
lamp
,
Mr
Lorry
closing
the
little
procession
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
not
traversed
many
steps
of
the
long
main
staircase
when
he
stopped
,
and
stared
at
the
roof
and
round
at
the
wails
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
remember
the
place
,
my
father
?
 
<EOS>
You
remember
coming
up
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
But
,
before
she
could
repeat
the
question
,
he
murmured
an
answer
as
if
she
had
repeated
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Remember
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
do
n't
remember
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
so
very
long
ago
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
That
he
had
no
recollection
whatever
of
his
having
been
brought
from
his
prison
to
that
house
,
was
apparent
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
heard
him
mutter
,
"
One
Hundred
and
Five
,
North
Tower
;
"
and
when
he
looked
about
him
,
it
evidently
was
for
the
strong
fortress
-
walls
which
had
long
encompassed
him
.
<EOS>
On
their
reaching
the
courtyard
he
instinctively
altered
his
tread
,
as
being
in
expectation
of
a
drawbridge
;
and
when
there
was
no
drawbridge
,
and
he
saw
the
carriage
waiting
in
the
open
street
,
he
dropped
his
daughter
's
hand
and
clasped
his
head
again
.
   
<EOS>
No
crowd
was
about
the
door
;
no
people
were
discernible
at
any
of
the
many
windows
;
not
even
a
chance
passerby
was
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
An
unnatural
silence
and
desertion
reigned
there
.
 
<EOS>
Only
one
soul
was
to
be
seen
,
and
that
was
Madame
Defarge
---
who
leaned
against
the
door
-
post
,
knitting
,
and
saw
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
The
prisoner
had
got
into
a
coach
,
and
his
daughter
had
followed
him
,
when
Mr
Lorry
's
feet
were
arrested
on
the
step
by
his
asking
,
miserably
,
for
his
shoemaking
tools
and
the
unfinished
shoes
.
 
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
immediately
called
to
her
husband
that
she
would
get
them
,
and
went
,
knitting
,
out
of
the
lamplight
,
through
the
courtyard
.
 
<EOS>
She
quickly
brought
them
down
and
handed
them
in
;
---
and
immediately
afterwards
leaned
against
the
door
-
post
,
knitting
,
and
saw
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
Defarge
got
upon
the
box
,
and
gave
the
word
"
To
the
Barrier
!
"
<EOS>
The
postilion
cracked
his
whip
,
and
they
clattered
away
under
the
feeble
over
-
swinging
lamps
.
   
<EOS>
Under
the
over
-
swinging
lamps
---
swinging
ever
brighter
in
the
better
streets
,
and
ever
dimmer
in
the
worse
---
and
by
lighted
shops
,
gay
crowds

illuminated

and

See

said
Defarge
,
getting
down
,
and
taking
him
gravely
apart
,
"
<EOS>
these
are
the

of
monsieur

<EOS>
They

He
dropped
his
voice
,
there
was
a
flutter
among
the
military
lanterns
,
and
one
of
them
being
handed
into
the
coach
by
an
arm
in
uniform
,
the
eyes
connected
with
the
arm
looked
,
not
an
every
day
or
an
every
night
look
,
at
monsieur
with
the
white
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
It

Forward

<EOS>
from
the
uniform

<EOS>
"
Adieu

from
Defarge
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
under
a
short
grove
of
feebler
and
feebler
over
-
swinging
lamps
,
out
under
the
great
grove
of
stars
.
   
<EOS>
Beneath
that
arch
of
unmoved
and
eternal
lights
;
some

so
remote
from
this
little
earth
that
the
learned
tell
us
it
is
doubtful
whether
their
rays
have
even
yet
discovered
it
,
as
a
point
in
space
where
anything
is
suffered
or
done
:
 
the
shadows
of
the
night
were
broad
and
black
.
 
<EOS>
All
through
the
cold
and
restless
interval
,
until
dawn
,
they
once
more
whispered
in
the
ears
of
Mr
Jarvis
Lorry
---
sitting
opposite
the
buried
man
who
had
been
dug
out
,
and
wondering
what
subtle
powers
were
for
ever
lost
to
him

and
what
were
capable
of
restoration

the
old
inquiry
:
   
<EOS>
"
I

you

Five
Years
Later
 
Tellson
's
Bank
by
Temple
Bar
was
an
old
-
fashioned
place
,
even
in
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
eighty
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
small
,
very
dark
,
very
ugly
,
very
incommodious
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
old
-
fashioned
place
,
moreover
,
in
the
moral
attribute
that
the
partners
in
the
House
were
proud
of
its
smallness
,
proud
of
its
darkness
,
proud
of
its
ugliness
,
proud
of
its
incommodiousness
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
even
boastful
of
its
eminence
in
those
particulars
,
and
were
fired
by
an
express
conviction
that
,
if
it
were
less
objectionable
,
it
would
be
less
respectable
.
<EOS>
This
was
no
passive
belief
,
but
an
active
weapon
which
they
flashed
at
more
convenient
places
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
Tellson
's
(
they
said
)
wanted
no
elbow
-
room
,
Tellson
's
wanted
no
light
<EOS>
,
Tellson
's
wanted
no
embellishment
.
 
<EOS>
Noakes
and
Co.
's
might
,
or
Snooks
Brothers
'
might
;
but
Tellson
's
,
thank
Heaven
!
<EOS>
---
   
<EOS>
Any
one
of
these
partners
would
have
disinherited
his
son
on
the
question
of
rebuilding
Tellson
's
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
respect
the
House
was
much
on
a
par
with
the
Country
;
which
did
very
often
disinherit
its
sons
for
suggesting
improvements
in
laws
and
customs
that
had
long
been
highly
objectionable
,
but
were
only
the
more
respectable
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
it
had
come
to
pass
,
that
Tellson
's
was
the
triumphant
perfection
of
inconvenience
.
 
<EOS>
After
bursting
open
a
door
of
idiotic
obstinacy
with
a
weak
rattle
in
its
throat
,
you
fell
into
Tellson
's
down
two
steps
,
and
came
to
your
senses
in
a
miserable
little
shop
,
with
two
little
counters
,
where
the
oldest
of
men
made
your
cheque
shake
as
if
the
wind
rustled
it
,
while
they
examined
the
signature
by
the
dingiest
of
windows
,
which
were
always
under
a
shower
-
bath
of
mud
from
Fleet
-
street
,
and
which
were
made
the
dingier
by
their
own
iron
bars
proper
,
and
the
heavy
shadow
of
Temple
Bar
.
 
<EOS>
If
your
business
necessitated
your
seeing
"
the
House
,
"
you
were
put
into
a
species
of
Condemned
Hold
at
the
back
,
where
you
meditated
on
a
misspent
life
,
until
the
House
came
with
its
bands
in
its
pockets
,
and
you
could
hardly
blink
at
it
in
the
dismal
twilight
.
 
<EOS>
Your
money
came
out
of
,
or
went
into
,
wormy
old
wooden
drawers
,
particles
of
which
flew
up
your
nose
and
down
your
throat
when
they
were
opened
and
shut
.
 
<EOS>
Your
bank
-
notes
had
a
musty
odour
,
as
if
they
were
fast
decomposing
into
rags
again
.
 
<EOS>
Your
plate
was
stowed
away
among
the
neighbouring
cesspools
,
and
evil
communications
corrupted
its
good
polish
in
a
day
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
Your
deeds
got
into
extemporised
strong
-
rooms
made
of
kitchens
and
sculleries
,
and
fretted
all
the
fat
out
of
their
parchments
into
the
banking
-
house
air
.
 
<EOS>
Your
lighter
boxes
of
family
papers
went
up
-
stairs
into
a
Barmecide
room
,
that
always
had
a
great
dining
-
table
in
it
and
never
had
a
dinner
,
and
where
,
even
in
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
eighty
,
the
first
letters
written
to
you
by
your
old
love
,
or
by
your
little
children
,
were
but
newly
released
from
the
horror
of
being
ogled
through
the
windows
,
by
the
heads
exposed
on
Temple
Bar
with
an
insensate
brutality
and
ferocity
worthy
of
Abyssinia
or
Ashantee
.
   
<EOS>
But
indeed
,
at
that
time
,
putting
to
death
was
a
recipe
much
in
vogue
with
all
trades
and
professions
,
and
not
least
of
all
with
Tellson
's
.
<EOS>
Death
is
Nature
's
remedy
for
all
things
,
and
why
not
Legislation
's
?
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
the
forger
was
put
to
Death
;
the
utterer
of
a
bad
note
was
put
to
Death
;
the
unlawful
opener
of
a
letter
was
put
to
Death
;
the
purloiner
of
forty
shillings
and
sixpence
was
put
to
Death
;
the
holder
of
a
horse
at
Tellson
's
door
,
who
made
off
with
it
,
was
put
to
Death
;
the
coiner
of
a
bad
shilling
was
put
to
Death
;
the
sounders
of
three
-
fourths
of
the
notes
in
the
whole
gamut
of
Crime
,
were
put
to
Death
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
it
did
the
least
good
in
the
way
of
prevention
<EOS>
---
it
might
almost
have
been
worth
remarking
that
the
fact
was
exactly
the
reverse
---
but
,
it
cleared
off
(
as
to
this
world
)
<EOS>
the
trouble
of
each
particular
case
,
and
left
nothing
else
connected
with
it
to
be
looked
after
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
Tellson
's
,
in
its
day
,
like
greater
places
of
business
,
its
contemporaries
,
had
taken
so
many
lives
,
that
,
if
the
heads
laid
low
before
it
had
been
ranged
on
Temple
Bar
instead
of
being
privately
disposed
of
,
they
would
probably
have
excluded
what
little
light
the
ground
floor
bad
,
in
a
rather
significant
manner
.
   
<EOS>
Cramped
in
all
kinds
of
dun
cupboards
and
hutches
at
Tellson
's
,
the
oldest
of
men
carried
on
the
business
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
took
a
young
man
into
Tellson
's
London
house
,
they
hid
him
somewhere
till
he
was
old
.
 
<EOS>
They
kept
him
in
a
dark
place
,
like
a
cheese
,
until
he
had
the
full
Tellson
flavour
and
blue
-
mould
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
Then
only
was
he
permitted
to
be
seen
,
spectacularly
poring
over
large
books
,
and
casting
his
breeches
and
gaiters
into
the
general
weight
of
the
establishment
.
   
<EOS>
Outside
Tellson
's
---
never
by
any
means
in
it
,
unless
called
in
---
was
an
odd
-
job
-
man
,
an
occasional
porter
and
messenger
,
who
served
as
the
live
sign
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
never
absent
during
business
hours
,
unless
upon
an
errand
,
and
then
he
was
represented
by
his
son
:
 
<EOS>
a
grisly
urchin
of
twelve
,
who
was
his
express
image
.
 
<EOS>
People
understood
that
Tellson
's
,
in
a
stately
way
,
tolerated
the
odd
-
job
-
man
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
had
always
tolerated
some
person
in
that
capacity
,
and
time
and
tide
had
drifted
this
person
to
the
post
.
 
<EOS>
His
surname
was
Cruncher
,
and
on
the
youthful
occasion
of
his
renouncing
by
proxy
the
works
of
darkness
,
in
the
easterly
parish
church
of
Hounsditch
,
he
had
received
the
added
appellation
of
Jerry
.
   
<EOS>
The
scene
was
Mr
Cruncher
's
private
lodging
in
Hanging
-
sword
-
alley
,
Whitefriars
:
 
<EOS>
the
time
,
half
-
past
seven
of
the
clock
on
a
windy
March
morning
,
Anno
Domini
seventeen
hundred
and
eighty
.
<EOS>
(
Mr
Cruncher
himself
always
spoke
of
the
year
of
our
Lord
as
Anna
Dominoes
:
apparently
under
the
impression
that
the
Christian
era
dated
from
the
invention
of
a
popular
game
,
by
a
lady
who
had
bestowed
her
name
upon
it
.
)
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
's
apartments
were
not
in
a
savoury
neighbourhood
,
and
were
but
two
in
number
,
even
if
a
closet
with
a
single
pane
of
glass
in
it
might
be
counted
as
one
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
were
very
decently
kept
.
<EOS>
Early
as
it
was
,
on
the
windy
March
morning
,
the
room
in
which
he
lay
abed
was
already
scrubbed
throughout
;
and
between
the
cups
and
saucers
arranged
for
breakfast
,
and
the
lumbering
deal
table
,
a
very
clean
white
cloth
was
spread
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
reposed
under
a
patchwork
counterpane
,
like
a
Harlequin
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
At
fast
,
he
slept
heavily
,
but
,
by
degrees
,
began
to
roll
and
surge
in
bed
,
until
he
rose
above
the
surface
,
with
his
spiky
hair
looking
as
if
it
must
tear
the
sheets
to
ribbons
.
 
<EOS>
At
which
juncture
,
he
exclaimed
,
in
a
voice
of
dire
exasperation
:
   
"
<EOS>
Bust
me
,
if
she
ai
n't
at
it
agin
!
"
   
<EOS>
A
woman
of
orderly
and
industrious
appearance
rose
from
her
knees
in
a
corner
,
with
sufficient
haste
and
trepidation
to
show
that
she
was
the
person
referred
to
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
,
looking
out
of
bed
for
a
boot
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
at
it
agin
,
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
After
hailing
the
mom
with
this
second
salutation
,
he
threw
a
boot
at
the
woman
as
a
third
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
muddy
boot
,
and
may
introduce
the
odd
circumstance
connected
with
Mr
Cruncher
's
domestic
economy
,
that
,
whereas
he
often
came
home
after
banking
hours
with
clean
boots
,
he
often
got
up
next
morning
to
find
the
same
boots
covered
with
clay
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
,
varying
his
apostrophe
after
missing
his
mark
---
"
what
are
you
up
to
,
Aggerawayter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
only
saying
my
prayers

"
   
<EOS>
"
Saying
your

<EOS>
You

nice
woman

<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
by
flopping
yourself
down
and
praying
agin
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
praying
against
you
;
I
was
praying
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
were

<EOS>
And
if
you
were
,
I

<EOS>
Here

<EOS>
your

<EOS>
You

my

going

flopping
herself
down

and
praying
that
the
bread

and
-
butter
may
be
snatched
out
of
the
mouth
of
her
only
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
Master
Cruncher
(
who
was
in
his
shirt
)
took
this
very
ill
,
and
,
turning
to
his
mother
,
strongly
deprecated
any
praying
away
of
his
personal
board
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
do
you
suppose
,
you
conceited
female
,
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
,
with
unconscious
inconsistency
,
"
that
the
worth
of
YOUR
prayers
may
be
?
<EOS>
Name
the
price
that
you
put
YOUR
prayers
at
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
only
come
from
the
heart
,
Jerry
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
worth
no
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Worth
no
more
than
that
,
"
repeated
Mr
Cruncher
.
<EOS>
"
They
ai
n't
worth
much
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
<EOS>
or
no

I
wo

be
prayed
agin

I
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca

it

<EOS>
I
'm
not

going

be
made
unlucky
by
YOUR
sneaking

<EOS>
If
you
must
go
flopping
yourself
down
,
flop
in
favour
of
your
husband

child
,
and
not
in
opposition
to
'em

<EOS>
If
I
had
had
any
but
a
unnat'ral
wife
,
and
this
poor
boy
had
had
any
but
a
unnat'ral
mother

I
might
have
made
some
money
last
week
instead
of
being
counter

prayed
and
countermined
and
religiously
circumwented
into
the
worst
of
luck

<EOS>
B

"
said
Mr
Cruncher
,
who
all
this
time
had
been
putting
on
his
clothes
,
"
if
I
ai
n't
,

piety

<EOS>
Young
Jerry
,
dress
yourself
,
my
boy
,
and
while
I
clean
my
boots
keep
a
eye
upon
your
mother
now
and
then
,
and
if
you
see
any
signs
of
more
flopping
,
give
me
a
call
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
I
tell
you
,
"
here
he
addressed
his
wife
once
more
,
"
I
wo
n't
be
gone
agin
,
in
this
manner
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
as
rickety
as
a
hackney
-
coach
,
I
'm
as
sleepy
as
laudanum
,
my
lines
is
strained
to
that
degree
that
I

if

pain

which
was
me
and
which
somebody
else
,
yet
I
'm
none

better
for
it
in
pocket
;
and
it
's
my
suspicion
that
you
've
been
at
it
from
morning
to
night
to
prevent
me
from
being
the
better
for
it
in
pocket

and
I

put
up

,
Aggerawayter

and
<EOS>
what

you
say
now

"
   
<EOS>
Growling
,
in
addition
,
such
phrases
as
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
yes
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
religious
,
too

<EOS>
You
would
n't
put
yourself
in
opposition
to
the
interests
of
your
husband

child
,
would
you
?
 
<EOS>
Not
you
!
"
<EOS>
and
throwing
off
other
sarcastic
sparks
from
the
whirling
grindstone
of
his
indignation
,
Mr
Cruncher
betook
himself
to
his
boot
-
cleaning
and
his
general
preparation
for
business
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
his
son
,
whose
head
was
garnished
with
tenderer
spikes
,
and
whose
young
eyes
stood
close
by
one
another
,
as
his
father
's
did
,
kept
the
required
watch
upon
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
He
greatly
disturbed
that
poor
woman
at
intervals
,
by
darting
out
of
his
sleeping
closet
,
where
he
made
his
toilet
,
with
a
suppressed
cry
of
"
You
are
going
to
flop
,
mother
.
  
<EOS>
---
Halloa
,
father
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
after
raising
this
fictitious
alarm
,
darting
in
again
with
an
undutiful
grin
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
's
temper
was
not
at
all
improved
when
he
came
to
his
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
He
resented
Mrs
Cruncher
's
saying
grace
with
particular
animosity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Aggerawayter
!
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
up
to
?
 
<EOS>
At
it
again
?
"
   
<EOS>
His
wife
explained
that
she
had
merely
"
asked
a
blessing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
do
it
!
"
<EOS>
said
Mr
Crunches
looking
about
,
as
if
he
rather
expected
to
see
the
loaf
disappear
under
the
efficacy
of
his
wife
's
petitions
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ai

blest
out

I
wo

blest
off
my

<EOS>
Keep
still

"
   
<EOS>
Exceedingly
red
-
eyed
and
grim
,
<EOS>
as
if
he
had
been
up
all
night
at
a
party
which
had
taken
anything
but
a
convivial
turn
,
Jerry
Cruncher
worried
his
breakfast
rather
than
ate
it
,
growling
over
it
like
any
four
-
footed
inmate
of
a
menagerie
.
 
<EOS>
Towards
nine
o'clock
he
smoothed
his
ruffled
aspect
,
and
,
presenting
as
respectable
and
business
-
like
an
exterior
as
he
could
overlay
his
natural
self
with
,
issued
forth
to
the
occupation
of
the
day
.
   
<EOS>
It
could
scarcely
be
called
a
trade
,
in
spite
of
his
favourite
description
of
himself
as
"
a
honest
tradesman
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
His
stock
consisted
of
a
wooden
stool
,
made
out
of
a
broken
-
backed
chair
cut
down
,
<EOS>
which
stool
,
young
Jerry
,
walking
at
his
father
's
side
,
carried
every
morning
to
beneath
the
banking
-
house
window
that
was
nearest
Temple
Bar
:
 
where
,
with
the
addition
of
the
first
handful
of
straw
that
could
be
gleaned
from
any
passing
vehicle
to
keep
the
cold
and
wet
from
the
odd
-
job
-
man
's
feet
,
it
formed
the
encampment
for
the
day
.
<EOS>
On
this
post
of
his
,
Mr
Cruncher
was
as
well
known
to
Fleet
-
street
and
the
Temple
,
as
the
Bar
itself
,
---
and
was
almost
as
in
-
looking
.
   
<EOS>
Encamped
at
a
quarter
before
nine
,
in
good
time
to
touch
his
three
-
cornered
hat
to
the
oldest
of
men
as
they
passed
in
to
Tellson
's
,
Jerry
took
up
his
station
on
this
windy
March
morning
,
with
young
Jerry
standing
by
him
,
when
not
engaged
in
making
forays
through
the
Bar
,
to
inflict
bodily
and
mental
injuries
of
an
acute
description
on
passing
boys
who
were
small
enough
for
his
amiable
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Father
and
son
,
extremely
like
each
other
,
looking
silently
on
at
the
morning
traffic
in
Fleet
-
street
,
with
their
two
heads
as
near
to
one
another
as
the
two
eyes
of
each
were
,
bore
a
considerable
resemblance
to
a
pair
of
monkeys
.
 
<EOS>
The
resemblance
was
not
lessened
by
the
accidental
circumstance
,
<EOS>
that
the
mature
Jerry
bit
and
spat
out
straw
,
while
the
twinkling
eyes
of
the
youthful
Jerry
were
as
restlessly
watchful
of
him
as
of
everything
else
in
Fleet
-
street
.
   
<EOS>
The
head
of
one
of
the
regular
indoor
messengers
attached
to
Tellson
's
establishment
was
put
through
the
door
,
and
the
word
was
given
:
   
<EOS>
"
Porter
wanted
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hooray
,
father
!
 
<EOS>
Here
's
an
early
job
to
begin
with
!
"
   
<EOS>
Having
thus
given
his
parent
God
speed
,
young
Jerry
seated
himself
on
the
stool
,
entered
on
his
reversionary
interest
in
the
straw
his
father
had
been
chewing
,
and
cogitated
.
   
<EOS>
"
Al
-
ways
rusty
!
 
<EOS>
His
fingers
is
al
-
ways
rusty
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
young
Jerry
.
<EOS>
"
Where
does
my
father
get
all
that
iron
rust
from
?
 
<EOS>
He
do
n't
get
no
iron
rust
here
!

A
Sight
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
the
Old
Bailey
,
well
,
no
doubt
?
"
said
one
of
the
oldest
of
clerks
to
Jerry
the
messenger
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ye
-
es
,
sir
,
"
returned
Jerry
,
in
something
of
a
dogged
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
DO
know
the
Bailey
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
so
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
know
Mr
Lorry
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
Mr
Lorry
,
sir
,
much
better
than
I
know
the
Bailey
.
 
<EOS>
Much
better
,
"
said
Jerry
,
not
unlike
a
reluctant
witness
at
the
establishment
in
question
,
"
than
I
,
as
a
honest
tradesman
,
wish
to
know
the
Bailey
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
.
 
<EOS>
Find
the
door
where
the
witnesses
go
in
,
and
show
the
door
-
keeper
this
note
for
Mr
Lorry
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
then
let
you
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Into
the
court
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Into
the
court
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
's
eyes
seemed
to
get
a
little
closer
to
one
another
,
and
to
interchange
the
inquiry
,
"
What
do
you
think
of
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
wait
in
the
court
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
as
the
result
of
that
conference
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
-
keeper
will
pass
the
note
to
Mr
Lorry
,
and
do
you
make
any
gesture
that
will
attract
Mr
Lorry
's
attention
,
and
show
him
where
you
stand
.
 
<EOS>
Then
what
you
have
to
do
,
is
,
to
remain
there
until
he
wants
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
.
 
<EOS>
He
wishes
to
have
a
messenger
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
to
tell
him
you
are
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
ancient
clerk
deliberately
folded
and
superscribed
the
note
,
Mr
Cruncher
,
after
surveying
him
in
silence
until
he
came
to
the
blotting
-
paper
stage
,
remarked
:
   
"
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
'll
be
trying
Forgeries
this
morning
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Treason
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
quartering
,
"
said
Jerry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Barbarous
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
law
,
"
remarked
the
ancient
clerk
,
turning
his
surprised
spectacles
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
law
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
hard
in
the
law
to
spile
a
man
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
Ifs
hard
enough
to
kill
him
,
but
it
's
wery
hard
to
spile
him
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
retained
the
ancient
clerk
.
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
well
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
Take
care
of
your
chest
and
voice
,
my
good
friend
,
and
leave
the
law
to
take
care
of
itself
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
you
that
advice
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
damp
,
sir
,
what
settles
on
my
chest
and
voice
,
"
said
Jerry
.
<EOS>
"
I
leave
you
to
judge
what
a
damp
way
of
earning
a
living
mine
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
WeB
,
well
<EOS>
,
"
said
the
old
clerk
;
"
we
aa
have
our
various
ways
of
gaining
a
livelihood
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
us
have
damp
ways
,
and
some
of
us
have
dry
ways
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
Go
along
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jerry
took
the
letter
,
and
,
remarking
to
himself
with
less
internal
deference
than
he
made
an
outward
show
of
,
"
You
are
a
lean
old
one
,
too
,
"
made
his
bow
,
informed
his
son
,
in
passing
,
of
his
destination
,
and
went
his
way
.
   
<EOS>
They
hanged
at
Tyburn
,
in
those
days
,
so
the
street
outside
Newgate
had
not
obtained
one
infamous
notoriety
that
has
since
attached
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
gaol
was
a
vile
place
,
in
which
most
kinds
of
debauchery
and
villainy
were
practised
,
and
where
dire
diseases
were
bred
,
that
came
into
court
with
the
prisoners
,
and
sometimes
rushed
straight
from
the
dock
at
my
Lord
Chief
Justice
himself
,
and
pulled
him
off
the
bench
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
more
than
once
happened
,
that
the
Judge
in
the
black
cap
pronounced
his
own
doom
as
certainly
as
the
prisoner
's
,
and
even
died
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
rest
,
the
Old
Bailey
was
famous
as
a
kind
of
deadly
inn
-
yard
,
from
which
pale
travellers
set
out
continually
,
in
carts
and
coaches
,
on
a
violent
passage
into
the
other
world
:
 
traversing
some
two
miles
and
a
half
of
public
street
and
road
,
and
shaming
few
good
citizens
,
if
any
.
 
<EOS>
So
powerful
is
use
,
and
so
desirable
to
be
good
use
in
the
beginning
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
famous
,
too
,
for
the
pillory
,
a
wise
old
institution
,
that
inflicted
a
punishment
of
which
no
one
could
foresee
the
extent
;
also
,
for
the
whipping
-
post
,
another
dear
old
institution
,
very
humanising
and
softening
to
behold
in
action
;
also
,
for
extensive
transactions
in
blood
-
money
,
another
fragment
of
ancestral
wisdom
,
systematically
leading
to
the
most
frightful
mercenary
crimes
that
could
be
committed
under
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
Altogether
,
the
Old
Bailey
,
at
that
date
,
was
a
choice
illustration
of
the
precept
,
that
"
Whatever
is
is
right
;
"
an
aphorism
that
would
be
as
final
as
it
is
lazy
,
did
it
not
include
the
troublesome
consequence
,
that
nothing
that
ever
was
,
was
wrong
.
   
<EOS>
Making
his
way
through
the
tainted
crowd
,
dispersed
up
and
down
this
hideous
scene
of
action
,
with
the
skill
of
a
man
accustomed
to
make
his
way
quietly
,
the
messenger
found
out
the
door
he
sought
,
and
handed
in
his
letter
through
a
trap
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
people
then
paid
to
see
the
play
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
just
as
they
paid
to
see
the
play
in
Bedlam
---
only
the
former
entertainment
was
much
the
dearer
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
all
the
Old
Bailey
doors
were
well
guarded
---
except
,
indeed
,
the
social
doors
by
which
the
criminals
got
there
,
and
those
were
always
left
wide
open
.
   
<EOS>
After
some
delay
and
demur
,
the
door
grudgingly
turned
on
its
hinges
a
very
little
way
,
and
allowed
Mr
Jerry
Cruncher
to
squeeze
himself
into
court
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
on
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
in
a
whisper
,
of
the
man
he
found
himself
next
to
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
yet
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
coming
on
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
Treason
case
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
quartering
one
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
returned
the
man
,
with
a
relish
;
"
he
'll
be
drawn
on
a
hurdle
to
be
half
hanged
,
and
then
he
'll
be
taken
down
and
sliced
before
his
own
face
,
and
then
his
inside
will
be
taken
out
and
burnt
while
he
looks
on
,
and
then
his
head
will
be
chopped
off
,
and
he
'll
be
cut
into
quarters
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
sentence
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
he
's
found
Guilty
,
you
mean
to
say
?
"
<EOS>
Jerry
added
,
by
way
of
proviso
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
they
'll
find
him
guilty
,
"
said
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
be
afraid
of
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
's
attention
was
here
diverted
to
the
door
-
keeper
,
whom
he
saw
making
his
way
to
Mr
Lorry
,
with
the
note
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
sat
at
a
table
,
among
the
gentlemen
in
wigs
:
 
not
far
from
a
wigged
gentleman
,
the
prisoner
's
counsel
,
who
had
a
great
bundle
of
papers
before
him
:
 
and
nearly
opposite
another
wigged
gentleman
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
whose
whole
attention
,
when
Mr
Cruncher
looked
at
him
then
or
afterwards
,
seemed
to
be
concentrated
on
the
ceiling
of
the
court
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
gruff
coughing
and
rubbing
of
his
chin
and
signing
with
his
hand
,
Jerry
attracted
the
notice
of
Mr
Lorry
,
who
had
stood
up
to
look
for
him
,
and
who
quietly
nodded
and
sat
down
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
HE
got
to
do
with
the
case
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
man
he
had
spoken
with
.
   
<EOS>
"
Blest
if
I
know
,
"
said
Jerry
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
have
YOU
got
to
do
with
it
,
then
,
if
a
person
may
inquire
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Blest
if
I
know
that
either
,
"
said
Jerry
.
   
<EOS>
The
entrance
of
the
Judge
,
and
a
consequent
great
stir
and
settling
down
in
the
court
,
stopped
the
dialogue
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
,
the
dock
became
the
central
point
of
interest
.
 
<EOS>
Two
gaolers
,
who
had
been
standing
there
,
wo
nt
out
,
and
the
prisoner
was
brought
in
,
and
put
to
the
bar
.
   
<EOS>
Everybody
present
,
except
the
one
wigged
gentleman
who
looked
at
the
ceiling
,
stared
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
human
breath
in
the
place
,
rolled
at
him
,
like
a
sea
,
or
a
wind
,
or
a
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Eager
faces
strained
round
pillars
and
corners
,
to
get
a
sight
of
him
;
spectators
in
back
rows
stood
up
,
not
to
miss
a
hair
of
him
;
people
on
the
floor
of
the
court
,
laid
their
hands
on
the
shoulders
of
the
people
before
them
,
to
help
themselves
,
at
anybody
's
cost
,
to
a
view
of
him
<EOS>
---
stood
a
-
tiptoe
,
got
upon
ledges
,
stood
upon
next
to
nothing
,
to
see
every
inch
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Conspicuous
among
these
latter
,
like
an
animated
bit
of
the
spiked
wall
of
Newgate
<EOS>
,
Jerry
stood
:
 
aiming
at
the
prisoner
the
beery
breath
of
a
whet
he
had
taken
as
he
came
along
,
and
discharging
it
to
mingle
with
the
waves
of
other
beer
,
and
gin
,
and
tea
,
and
coffee
,
and
what
not
,
that
flowed
at
him
,
and
already
broke
upon
the
great
windows
behind
him
in
an
impure
mist
and
rain
.
   
<EOS>
The
object
of
all
this
staring
and
blaring
,
was
a
young
man
of
about
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
well
-
grown
and
well
-
looking
,
with
a
sunburnt
cheek
and
a
dark
eye
.
 
<EOS>
His
condition
was
that
of
a
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
plainly
dressed
in
black
,
or
<EOS>
very
dark
grey
,
and
his
hair
,
which
was
long
and
dark
,
was
gathered
in
a
ribbon
at
the
back
of
his
neck
;
more
to
be
out
of
his
way
than
for
ornament
.
 
<EOS>
As
an
emotion
of
the
mind
will
express
itself
through
any
covering
of
the
body
,
so
the
paleness
which
his
situation
engendered
came
through
the
brown
upon
his
cheek
,
showing
the
soul
to
be
stronger
than
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
otherwise
quite
self
-
possessed
,
bowed
to
the
Judge
,
and
stood
quiet
.
   
<EOS>
The
sort
of
interest
with
which
this
man
was
stared
and
breathed
at
,
was
not
a
sort
that
elevated
humanity
.
 
<EOS>
Had
he
stood
in
peril
of
a
less
horrible
sentence
---
<EOS>
had
there
been
a
chance
of
any
one
of
its
savage
details
being
spared
---
<EOS>
by
just
so
much
would
he
have
lost
in
his
fascination
.
 
<EOS>
The
form
that
was
to
be
doomed
to
be
so
shamefully
mangled
,
was
the
sight
;
the
immortal
creature
that
was
to
be
so
butchered
and
torn
asunder
,
yielded
the
sensation
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
gloss
the
various
spectators
put
upon
the
interest
,
according
to
their
several
arts
and
powers
of
self
-
deceit
,
the
interest
was
,
at
the
root
of
it
,
Ogreish
.
   
<EOS>
Silence
in
the
court
!
 
<EOS>
Charles
Darnay
had
yesterday
pleaded
Not
Guilty
to
an
indictment
denouncing

(

with
his
head
becoming
more
and
more
spiky
as
the
law
terms
bristled
it
,
made
out
with
huge
satisfaction
,
and
so
arrived
circuitously
at
the
understanding
that
the
aforesaid
,
and
over
and
over
again
aforesaid
,
Charles
Darnay
,
stood
there
before
him
upon
his
trial
;
that
the
jury
were
swearing
in
;
and
that
Mr
Attorney
-
General
was
making
ready
to
speak
.
   
<EOS>
The
accused
,
who
was
(
and
who
knew
he
was
)
being
mentally
hanged
,
beheaded
,
and
quartered
,
by
everybody
there
,
neither
flinched
from
the
situation
,
nor
assumed
any
theatrical
air
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
quiet
and
attentive
;
watched
the
opening
proceedings
with
a
grave
interest
;
and
stood
with
his
hands
resting
on
the
slab
of
wood
before
him
,
so
composedly
,
that
they
had
not
displaced
a
leaf
of
the
herbs
with
which
it
was
strewn
.
 
<EOS>
The
court
was
all
bestrewn
with
herbs
and
sprinkled
with
vinegar
,
as
a
precaution
against
gaol
air
and
gaol
fever
.
   
<EOS>
Over
the
prisoner
's
head
there
was
a
mirror
,
to
throw
the
light
down
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
Crowds
of
the
wicked
and
the
wretched
had
been
reflected
in
it
,
and
had
passed
from
its
surface
and
this
earth
's
together
.
<EOS>
Haunted
in
a
most
ghastly
manner
that
abominable
place
would
have
been
,
if
the
glass
could
ever
have
rendered
back
its
reflections
,
as
the
ocean
is
one
day
to
give
up
its
dead
.
 
<EOS>
Some
passing
thought
of
the
infamy
and
disgrace
for
which
it
had
been
reserved
,
may
have
struck
the
prisoner
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
may
,
a
change
in
his
position
making
him
conscious
of
a
bar
of
light
across
his
face
,
he
looked
up
;
and
when
he
saw
the
glass
his
face
flushed
,
and
his
right
hand
pushed
the
herbs
away
.
   
<EOS>
It
happened
,
that
the
action
turned
his
face
to
that
side
of
the
court
which
was
on
his
left
.
 
<EOS>
About
on
a
level
with
his
eyes
<EOS>
,
there
sat
,
in
that
corner
of
the
Judge
's
bench
,
two
persons
upon
whom
his
look
immediately
rested
;
so
immediately
,
and
so
much
to
the
changing
of
his
aspect
,
that
all
the
eyes
that
were
tamed
upon
him
,
turned
to
them
.
   
<EOS>
The
spectators
saw
in
the
two
figures
,
a
young
lady
of
little
more
than
twenty
,
and
a
gentleman
who
was
evidently
her
father
;
a
man
of
a
very
remarkable
appearance
in
respect
of
the
absolute
whiteness
of
his
hair
,
and
a
certain
indescribable
intensity
of
face
:
 
not
of
an
active
kind
,
but
pondering
and
self
-
communing
.
 
<EOS>
When
this
expression
was
upon
him
,
he
looked
as
if
he
were
old
;
but
when
it
was
stirred
and
broken
up
---
as
it
was
now
,
in
a
moment
,
on
his
speaking
to
his
daughter
---
he
became
a
handsome
man
,
not
past
the
prime
of
life
.
   
<EOS>
His
daughter
had
one
of
her
hands
drawn
through
his
arm
,
as
she
sat
by
him
,
and
the
other
pressed
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
drawn
close
to
him
,
in
her
dread
of
the
scene
,
and
in
her
pity
for
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
Her
forehead
had
been
strikingly
expressive
of
an
engrossing
terror
and
compassion
that
saw
nothing
but
the
peril
of
the
accused
.
 
<EOS>
This
had
been
so
very
noticeable
,
so
<EOS>
very
powerfully
and
naturally
shown
,
that
starers
who
had
had
no
pity
for
him
were
touched
by
her
;
and
the
whisper
went
about
,
"
Who
are
they
?
"
   
<EOS>
Jerry
,
the
messenger
,
who
had
made
his
own
observations
,
in
his
own
manner
,
and
who
had
been
sucking
the
rust
off
his
fingers
in
his
absorption
,
stretched
his
neck
to
hear
who
they
were
.
 
<EOS>
The
crowd
about
him
had
pressed
and
passed
the
inquiry
on
to
the
nearest
attendant
,
and
from
him
it
had
been
more
slowly
pressed
and
passed
back
;
at
last
it
got
to
Jerry
:

The

's

<EOS>
The
Judge
,
whose
eyes
had
gone
in
the
general
direction
,
recalled
them
,
leaned
back
in
his
seat
,
and
looked
steadily
at
the
man
whose
life
was
in
his
hand
,
as
Mr
Attorney
-
General
rose
to
spin
the
rope
,
grind
the
axe
,
and
hammer
the
nails
into
the
scaffold
.

Chapter
3
.
<EOS>
A
Disappointment
 
Mr
Attorney
-
General
had
to
inform
the
jury
,
that
the
prisoner
before
them
,
though
young
in
years
,
was
old
in
the
treasonable
practices
which
claimed
the
forfeit
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
That
this
correspondence
with
the
public
enemy
was
not
a
correspondence
of
to
-
day
,
or
of
yesterday
,
or
even
of
last
year
,
or
of
the
year
before
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
it
was
certain
the
prisoner
had
,
for
longer
than
that
,
been
in
the
habit
of
passing
and
repassing
between
France
and
England
,
on
secret
business
of
which
he
could
give
no
honest
account
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
if
it
were
in
the
nature
of
traitorous
ways
to
thrive
(
which
happily
it
never
was
)
,
the
real
wickedness
and
guilt
of
his
business
might
have
remained
undiscovered
.
<EOS>
That
Providence
,
however
,
had
put
it
into
the
heart
of
a
person
who
was
beyond
fear
and
beyond
reproach
,
to
ferret
out
the
nature
of
the
prisoner
's
schemes
,
and
,
struck
with
horror
,
to
disclose
them
to
his
Majesty
's
Chief
Secretary
of
State
and
most
honourable
Privy
Council
.
<EOS>
That
,
this
patriot
would
be
produced
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
his
position
and
attitude
were
,
on
the
whole
,
sublime
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
he
had
been
the
prisoner
's
friend
,
but
,
at
once
in
an
auspicious
and
an
evil
hour
detecting
his
infamy
,
had
resolved
to
immolate
the
traitor
he
could
no
longer
cherish
in
his
bosom
,
on
the
sacred
altar
of
his
country
.
<EOS>
That
,
if
statues
were
decreed
in
Britain
,
as
in
ancient
Greece
and
Rome
,
to
public
benefactors
,
this
shining
citizen
would
assuredly
have
had
one
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
as
they
were
not
so
decreed
,
he
probably
would
not
have
one
.
 
<EOS>
That
<EOS>
,
Virtue
,
as
had
been
observed
by
the
poets
(
in
many
passages
which
he
well
knew
the
jury
would
have
,
word
for
word
,
at
the
tips
of
their
tongues
;
whereat
<EOS>
the
jury
's
countenances
displayed
a
guilty
consciousness
that
they
knew
nothing
about
the
passages
)
,
was
in
a
manner
contagious
;
more
especially
the
bright
virtue
known
as
patriotism
,
or
love
of
country
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
the
lofty
example
of
this
immaculate
and
unimpeachable
witness
for
the
Crown
,
to
refer
to
whom
however
unworthily
was
an
honour
,
had
communicated
itself
to
the
prisoner
's
servant
,
and
had
engendered
in
him
a
holy
determination
to
examine
his
master
's
table
-
drawers
and
pockets
,
and
secrete
his
papers
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
he
(
Mr
Attorney
-
General
)
was
prepared
to
hear
some
disparagement
attempted
of
this
admirable
servant
;
but
that
,
in
a
general
way
,
he
preferred
him
to
his
(
Mr
Attorney
-
General
's
)
brothers
and
sisters
,
and
honoured
him
more
than
his
<EOS>
(
Mr
Attorney
-
General
's
)
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
That
<EOS>
,
he
called
with
confidence
on
the
jury
to
come
and
do
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
the
evidence
of
these
two
witnesses
,
coupled
with
the
documents
of
their
discovering
that
would
be
produced
,
would
show
the
prisoner
to
have
been
furnished
with
lists
of
his
Majesty
's
forces
,
and
of
their
disposition
and
preparation
,
both
by
sea
and
land
,
and
would
leave
no
doubt
that
he
had
habitually
conveyed
such
information
to
a
hostile
power
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
these
lists
could
not
be
proved
to
be
in
the
prisoner
's
handwriting
;
but
that
it
was
all
the
same
;
that
,
indeed
,
it
was
rather
the
better
for
the
prosecution
,
as
showing
the
prisoner
to
be
artful
in
his
precautions
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
the
proof
would
go
back
five
years
,
and
would
show
the
prisoner
already
engaged
in
these
pernicious
missions
,
within
a
few
weeks
before
the
date
of
the
very
first
action
fought
between
the
British
troops
and
the
Americans
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
for
these
reasons
,
the
jury
,
being
a
loyal
jury
<EOS>
(
as
he
knew
they
were
)
,
and
being
a
responsible
jury
(
as
THEY
knew
they
were
)
,
must
positively
find
the
prisoner
Guilty
,
and
make
an
end
of
him
,
whether
they
liked
it
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
they
never
could
lay
their
heads
upon
their
pillows
;
that
,
they
never
could
tolerate
the
idea
of
their
wives
laying
their
heads
upon
their
pillows
;
that
,
they
never
could
endure
the
notion
of
their
children
laying
their
heads
upon
their
pillows
;
in
short
,
that
there
never
more
could
be
,
for
them
or
theirs
,
any
laying
of
heads
upon
pillows
at
all
,
unless
the
prisoner
's
head
was
taken
off
.
 
<EOS>
That
head
Mr
Attorney
-
General
concluded
by
demanding
of
them
,
in
the
name
of
everything
he
could
think
of
with
a
round
turn
in
it
,
and
on
the
faith
of
his
solemn
asseveration
that
he
already
considered
the
prisoner
as
good
as
dead
and
gone
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
Attorney
-
General
ceased
,
a
buzz
arose
in
the
court
as
if
a
cloud
of
great
blue
-
flies
were
swarming
about
the
prisoner
,
in
anticipation
of
what
he
was
soon
to
become
.
 
<EOS>
When
toned
down
again
,
the
unimpeachable
patriot
appeared
in
the
witness
-
box
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Solicitor
-
General
then
,
following
his
leader
's
lead
,
examined
the
patriot
:
 
John
Barsad
,
gentleman
,
by
name
.
 
<EOS>
The
story
of
his
pure
soul
was
exactly
what
Mr
Attorney
-
General
had
described
it
to
be
---
perhaps
,
if
it
had
a
fault
,
a
little
too
exactly
.
 
<EOS>
Having
released
his
noble
bosom
of
its
burden
,
he
would
have
modestly
withdrawn
himself
,
but
that
the
wigged
gentleman
with
the
papers
before
him
,
sitting
not
far
from
Mr
Lorry
,
begged
to
ask
him
a
few
questions
.
<EOS>
The
wigged
gentleman
sitting
opposite
,
still
looking
at
the
ceiling
of
the
court
.
   
<EOS>
Had
he
ever
been
a
spy
himself
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
he
scorned
the
base
insinuation
.
<EOS>
What
did
he
live
upon
?
 
<EOS>
His
property
.
 
<EOS>
Where
was
his
property
?
<EOS>
He
did
n't
precisely
remember
where
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
it
?
 
<EOS>
No
business
of
anybody
's
.
 
<EOS>
Had
he
inherited
it
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
he
had
.
 
<EOS>
From
whom
?
 
<EOS>
Distant
relation
.
 
<EOS>
Very
distant
?
 
<EOS>
Rather
.
 
<EOS>
Ever
been
in
prison
?
 
<EOS>
Certainly
not
.
<EOS>
Never
in
a
debtors
'
prison
?
 
<EOS>
Did
n't
see
what
that
had
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
Never
in
a
debtors
'
prison
?
<EOS>
---
Come
,
once
again
.
 
<EOS>
Never
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
How
many
times
?
 
<EOS>
Two
or
three
times
.
 
<EOS>
Not
five
or
six
?
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
Of
what
profession
?
<EOS>
Gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
Ever
been
kicked
?
 
<EOS>
Might
have
been
.
<EOS>
Frequently
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Ever
kicked
downstairs
?
 
<EOS>
Decidedly
not
;
once
received
a
kick
on
the
top
of
a
staircase
,
and
fell
downstairs
of
his
own
accord
.
 
<EOS>
Kicked
on
that
occasion
for
cheating
at
dice
?
 
<EOS>
Something
to
that
effect
was
said
by
the
intoxicated
liar
who
committed
the
assault
,
but
it
was
not
true
.
 
<EOS>
Swear
<EOS>
it
was
not
true
?
 
<EOS>
Positively
.
<EOS>
Ever
live
by
cheating
at
play
?
 
<EOS>
Never
.
 
<EOS>
Ever
live
by
play
?
 
<EOS>
Not
more
than
other
gentlemen
do
.
<EOS>
Ever
borrow
money
of
the
prisoner
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Ever
pay
him
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Was
not
this
intimacy
with
the
prisoner
,
in
reality
a
very
slight
one
,
forced
upon
the
prisoner
in
coaches
,
inns
,
and
packets
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
Sure
he
saw
the
prisoner
with
these
lists
?
 
<EOS>
Certain
.
 
<EOS>
Knew
no
more
about
the
lists
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Had
not
procured
them
himself
,
for
instance
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
Expect
to
get
anything
by
this
evidence
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Not
in
regular
government
pay
and
employment
,
to
lay
traps
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
dear
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
Or
to
do
anything
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
dear
no
.
<EOS>
Swear
that
?
 
<EOS>
Over
and
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
No
motives
but
motives
of
sheer
patriotism
?
<EOS>
None
whatever
.
   
<EOS>
The
virtuous
servant
,
Roger
Cly
,
swore
his
way
through
the
case
at
a
great
rate
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
taken
service
with
the
prisoner
,
in
good
faith
and
simplicity
,
four
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
asked
the
prisoner
,
aboard
the
Calais
packet
,
if
he
wanted
a
handy
fellow
,
and
the
prisoner
had
engaged
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
asked
the
prisoner
to
take
the
handy
fellow
as
an
act
of
charity
---
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
.
 
<EOS>
He
began
to
have
suspicions
of
the
prisoner
,
and
to
keep
an
eye
upon
him
,
soon
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
In
arranging
his
clothes
,
while
travelling
,
he
had
seen
similar
lists
to
these
in
the
prisoner
's
pockets
,
over
and
over
again
.
<EOS>
He
had
taken
these
lists
from
the
drawer
of
the
prisoner
's
desk
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
put
them
there
first
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
seen
the
prisoner
show
these
identical
lists
to
French
gentlemen
at
Calais
,
and
similar
lists
to
French
gentlemen
,
both
at
Calais
and
Boulogne
.
 
<EOS>
He
loved
his
country
,
and
could
n't
bear
it
,
and
had
given
information
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
never
been
suspected
of
stealing
a
silver
tea
-
pot
;
he
had
been
maligned
respecting
a
mustard
-
pot
,
but
it
turned
out
to
be
only
a
plated
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
known
the
last
witness
seven
or
eight
years
;
that
was
merely
a
coincidence
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
n't
call
it
a
particularly
curious
coincidence
;
most
coincidences
were
curious
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
<EOS>
did
he
call
it
a
curious
coincidence
that
true
patriotism
was
HIS
only
motive
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
true
Briton
,
and
hoped
there
were
many
like
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
blue
-
flies
buzzed
again
,
and
Mr
Attorney
-
General
called
Mr
Jarvis
Lorry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Jarvis
Lorry
,
are
you
a
clerk
in
Tellson
's
bank
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
a
certain
Friday
night
in
November
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
seventy
-
five
,
did
business
occasion
you
to
travel
between
London
and
Dover
by
the
mail
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Were
there
any
other
passengers
in
the
mail
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Two
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
they
alight
on
the
road
in
the
course
of
the
night
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Lorry
,
look
upon
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
Was
he
one
of
those
two
passengers
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
undertake
to
say
that
he
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
he
resemble
either
of
these
two
passengers
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Both
were
so
wrapped
up
,
and
the
night
was
so
dark
,
and
we
were
all
so
reserved
,
that
I
can
not
undertake
to
say
even
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Lorry
,
look
again
upon
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
Supposing
<EOS>
him
wrapped
up
as
those
two
passengers
were
,
is
there
anything
in
his
bulk
and
stature
to
render
it
unlikely
that
he
was
one
of
them
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
swear
,
Mr
Lorry
,
that
he
was
not
one
of
them
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
at
least
you
say
he
may
have
been
one
of
them
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Except
that
I
remember
them
both
to
have
been
---
like
myself
---
timorous
of
highwaymen
,
and
the
prisoner
has
not
a
timorous
air
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
see
a
counterfeit
of
timidity
,
Mr
Lorry
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
have
seen
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Lorry
,
look
once
more
upon
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
him
,
to
your
certain
knowledge
,
before
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
?
"
   
"
I
was
returning
from
France
a
few
days
afterwards
,
and
,
at
Calais
,
the
prisoner
came
on
board
the
packet
-
ship
in
which
I
returned
,
and
made
the
voyage
with
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
what
hour
did
he
come
on
board
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
a
little
after
midnight
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
dead
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
Was
he
the
only
passenger
who
came
on
board
at
that
untimely
hour
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
happened
to
be
the
only
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
about
"
happening
,
"
Mr
Lorry
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
only
passenger
who
came
on
board
in
the
dead
of
the
night
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Were
you
travelling
alone
,
Mr
Lorry
,
or
with
any
companion
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
two
companions
.
 
<EOS>
A
gentleman
and
lady
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
are
here
.
 
<EOS>
Had
you
any
conversation
with
the
prisoner
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hardly
any
.
 
<EOS>
The
weather
was
stormy
,
and
the
passage
long
and
rough
,
and
I
lay
on
a
sofa
,
almost
from
shore
to
shore
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Miss
Manette
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
young
lady
,
to
whom
all
eyes
had
been
turned
before
,
and
were
now
turned
again
,
stood
up
where
she
had
sat
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
rose
with
her
,
and
kept
her
hand
drawn
through
his
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Manette
,
look
upon
the
prisoner
.
"
   
<EOS>
To
be
confronted
with
such
pity
,
and
such
earnest
youth
and
beauty
,
was
far
more
trying
to
the
accused
than
to
be
confronted
with
all
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
Standing
,
as
it
were
,
apart
with
her
on
the
edge
of
his
grave
,
not
all
the
staring
curiosity
that
looked
on
,
could
,
for
the
moment
,
nerve
him
to
remain
quite
still
.
 
<EOS>
His
hurried
right
hand
parcelled
out
the
herbs
before
him
into
imaginary
beds
of
flowers
in
a
garden
;
and
his
efforts
to
control
and
steady
his
breathing
shook
the
lips
from
which
the
colour
rushed
to
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
The
buzz
of
the
great
flies
was
loud
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Manette
,
have
you
seen
the
prisoner
before
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
board
of
the
packet
-
ship
just
now
referred
to
,
sir
,
and
on
the
same
occasion
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
young
lady
just
now
referred
to
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
!
<EOS>
most
unhappily
,
I
am
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
plaintive
tone
of
her
compassion
merged
into
the
less
musical
voice
of
the
Judge
,
as
he
said
something
fiercely
:
"
Answer
the
questions
put
to
you
,
and
make
no
remark
upon
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Manette
,
had
you
any
conversation
with
the
prisoner
on
that
passage
across
the
Channel
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Recall
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
a
profound
stillness
,
she
faintly
began
:
 
"
When
the
gentleman
came
on
board
---
"
   
"
Do
you
mean
the
prisoner
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
Judge
,
knitting
his
brows
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
Lord
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
say
the
prisoner
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
the
prisoner
came
on
board
,
he
noticed
that
my
father
,
"
turning
her
eyes
lovingly
to
him
as
he
stood
beside
her
,
"
was
much
fatigued
and
in
a
very
weak
state
of
health
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
was
so
reduced
that
I
was
afraid
to
take
him
out
of
the
air
,
and
I
had
made
a
bed
for
him
on
the
deck
near
the
cabin
steps
,
and
I
sat
on
the
deck
at
his
side
to
take
care
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
no
other
passengers
that
night
,
but
we
four
.
 
<EOS>
The
prisoner
was
so
good
as
to
beg
permission
to
advise
me
how
I
could
shelter
my
father
from
the
wind
and
weather
,
better
than
I
had
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
not
known
how
to
do
it
well
,
not
understanding
how
the
wind
would
set
when
we
were
out
of
the
harbour
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
it
for
me
.
<EOS>
He
expressed
great
gentleness
and
kindness
for
my
father
's
state
,
and
I
am
sure
he
felt
it
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
the
manner
of
our
beginning
to
speak
together
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
interrupt
you
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Had
he
come
on
board
alone
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
many
were
with
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Two
French
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Had
they
conferred
together
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
had
conferred
together
until
the
last
moment
,
when
it
was
necessary
for
the
French
gentlemen
to
be
landed
in
their
boat
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Had
any
papers
been
handed
about
among
them
,
similar
to
these
lists
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Some
papers
had
been
handed
about
among
them
,
but
I
do
n't
know
what
papers
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Like
these
in
shape
and
size
?
"
   
"
<EOS>
Possibly
,
but
indeed
I
do
n't
know
,
although
they
stood
whispering
very
near
to
me
:
 
because
they
stood
at
the
top
of
the
cabin
steps
to
have
the
light
of
the
lamp
that
was
hanging
there
;
it
was
a
dull
lamp
,
and
they
spoke
very
low
,
and
I
did
not
hear
what
they
said
,
and
saw
only
that
they
looked
at
papers
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
to
the
prisoner
's
conversation
,
Miss
Manette
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
The
prisoner
was
as
open
in
his
confidence
with
me
---
which
arose
out
of
my
helpless
situation
---
as
he
was
kind
,
and
good
,
and
useful
to
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
"
bursting
into
tears
,
"
I
may
not
repay
him
by
doing
him
harm
to
-
day
.
"
   
<EOS>
Buzzing
from
the
blue
-
flies
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Manette
,
if
the
prisoner
does
not
perfectly
understand
that
you
give
the
evidence
which
it
is
your
duty
to
give
---
which
you
must
give
---
and
which
you
can
not
escape
from
giving
---
with
great
unwillingness
,
he
is
the
only
person
present
in
that
condition
.
 
<EOS>
Please
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
told
me
that
he
was
travelling
on
business
of
a
delicate
and
difficult
nature
,
which
might
get
people
into
trouble
,
and
that
he
was
therefore
travelling
under
an
assumed
name
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
that
this
business
had
,
within
a
few
days
,
taken
him
to
France
,
and
might
,
at
intervals
,
take
him
backwards
and
forwards
between
France
and
England
for
a
long
time
to
come
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
he
say
anything
about
America
,
Miss
Manette
?
 
<EOS>
Be
particular
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
tried
to
explain
to
me
how
that
quarrel
had
arisen
,
and
he
said
that
,
so
far
as
he
could
judge
,
it
was
a
wrong
and
foolish
one
on
England
's
part
.
 
<EOS>
He
added
,
in
a
jesting
way
,
that
perhaps
George
Washington
might
gain
almost
as
great
a
name
in
history
as
George
the
Third
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
harm
in
his
way
of
saying
this
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
said
laughingly
,
and
to
beguile
the
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
Any
strongly
marked
expression
of
face
on
the
part
of
a
chief
actor
in
a
scene
of
great
interest
to
whom
many
eyes
are
directed
,
will
be
unconsciously
imitated
by
the
spectators
.
 
<EOS>
Her
forehead
was
painfully
anxious
and
intent
as
she
gave
this
evidence
,
and
,
in
the
pauses
when
she
stopped
for
the
Judge
to
write
it
down
,
watched
its
effect
upon
the
counsel
for
and
against
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
lookers
-
<EOS>
on
there
was
the
same
expression
in
all
quarters
of
the
court
;
insomuch
,
that
a
great
majority
of
the
foreheads
there
,
might
have
been
mirrors
reflecting
the
witness
,
when
the
Judge
looked
up
from
his
notes
to
glare
at
that
tremendous
heresy
about
George
Washington
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Attorney
-
General
now
signified
to
my
Lord
,
that
he
deemed
it
necessary
,
as
a
matter
of
precaution
and
form
,
to
call
the
young
lady
's
father
,
Doctor
Manette
.
 
<EOS>
Who
was
called
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Doctor
Manette
,
look
upon
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
ever
seen
him
before
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Once
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
caged
at
my
lodgings
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
Some
three
years
,
or
three
years
and
a
half
ago
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Can
you
identify
him
as
your
fellow
-
passenger
on
board
the
packet
,
or
speak
to
his
conversation
with
your
daughter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
can
do
neither
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
particular
and
special
reason
for
your
being
unable
to
do
either
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
answered
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
There
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Has
it
been
your
misfortune
to
undergo
a
long
imprisonment
,
without
trial
,
or
even
accusation
,
in
your
native
country
,
Doctor
Manette
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
answered
,
in
a
tone
that
went
to
every
heart
,
"
A
long
imprisonment
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Were
you
newly
released
on
the
occasion
in
question
?

They
tell
me
so

Have
you
no
remembrance
of
the
occasion

<EOS>
"
None

<EOS>
My
mind
is
a
blank
,
from
some
time
---
I
can
not
even
say
what
time
---
when
I
employed
myself
,
in
my
captivity
,
in
making
shoes
,
to
the
time
when
I
found
myself
living
in
London
with
my
dear
daughter
here
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
become
familiar
to
me
,
when
a
gracious
God
restored
my
faculties
;
but
,
I
am
quite
unable
even
to
say
how
she
had
become
familiar
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
remembrance
of
the
process
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Attorney
-
General
sat
down
,
and
the
father
and
daughter
sat
down
together
.
   
<EOS>
A
singular
circumstance
then
arose
in
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
The
object
in
hand
being
to
show
that
the
prisoner
went
down
,
with
some
fellow
-
plotter
untracked
,
in
the
Dover
mail
on
that
Friday
night
in
November
five
years
ago
,
and
got
out
of
the
mail
in
the
night
,
as
a
blind
,
at
a
place
where
he
did
not
remain
,
but
from
which
he
travelled
back
some
dozen
miles
or
more
,
to
a
garrison
and
dockyard
,
and
there
collected
information
;
a
witness
was
called
to
identify
him
as
having
been
at
the
precise
time
required
,
in
the
coffee
-
room
of
an
hotel
in
that
garrison
-
and
-
dockyard
town
,
waiting
for
another
person
.
 
<EOS>
The
prisoner
's
counsel
was
cross
-
examining
this
witness
with
no
result
,
except
that
he
had
never
seen
the
prisoner
on
any
other
occasion
,
when
the
wigged
gentleman
who
had
all
this
time
been
looking
at
the
ceiling
of
the
court
,
wrote
a
word
or
two
on
a
little
piece
of
paper
,
screwed
it
up
,
and
tossed
it
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Opening
this
piece
of
paper
in
the
next
pause
,
the
counsel
looked
with
great
attention
and
curiosity
at
the
prisoner
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
say
again
you
are
quite
sure
that
it
was
the
prisoner
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
witness
was
quite
sure
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
see
anybody
very
like
the
prisoner
?
"
   
<EOS>
Not
so
like
(
the
witness
said
)
as
that
he
could
be
mistaken
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
well
upon
that
gentleman
,
my
learned
friend
there
,
"
pointing
to
him
who
had
tossed
the
paper
over
,
"
and
then
look
well
upon
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
How
say
you
?
 
<EOS>
Are
they
very
like
each
other
?
"
   
<EOS>
Allowing
for
my
learned
friend
's
appearance
being
careless
and
slovenly
if
not
debauched
,
they
were
sufficiently
like
each
other
to
surprise
,
not
only
the
witness
,
but
everybody
present
,
when
they
were
thus
brought
into
comparison
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
being
prayed
to
bid
my
learned
friend
<EOS>
lay
aside
his
wig
,
and
giving
no
very
gracious
consent
,
the
likeness
became
much
more
remarkable
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
inquired
of
Mr
Stryver
(
the
prisoner
's
counsel
)
,
whether
they
were
next
to
try
Mr
Carton
(
name
of
my
learned
friend
)
for
treason
?
 
<EOS>
But
,
Mr
Stryver
replied
to
my
Lord
,
no
;
but
he
would
ask
the
witness
to
tell
him
whether
what
happened
once
,
might
happen
twice
;
whether
he
would
have
been
so
confident
if
he
had
seen
this
illustration
of
his
rashness
sooner
,
whether
he
would
be
so
confident
,
having
seen
it
;
and
more
.
<EOS>
The
upshot
of
which
,
was
,
to
smash
this
witness
like
a
crockery
vessel
,
and
shiver
his
part
of
the
case
to
useless
lumber
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
had
by
this
time
taken
quite
a
lunch
of
rust
off
his
fingers
in
his
following
of
the
evidence
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
now
to
attend
while
Mr
Stryver
fitted
the
prisoner
's
case
on
the
jury
,
like
a
compact
suit
of
clothes
;
showing
them
how
the
patriot
,
Barsad
,
was
a
hired
spy
and
traitor
,
an
unblushing
trafficker
in
blood
,
and
one
of
the
greatest
scoundrels
upon
earth
since
accursed
Judas
---
which
he
certainly
did
look
rather
like
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
virtuous
servant
,
Cly
,
was
his
friend
and
partner
,
and
was
worthy
to
be
;
how
the
watchful
eyes
of
those
forgers
and
false
swearers
had
rested
on
the
prisoner
as
a
victim
,
because
some
family
affairs
in
France
,
he
being
of
French
extraction
,
did
require
his
making
those
passages
across
the
Channel
---
though
what
those
affairs
were
,
a
consideration
for
others
who
were
near
and
dear
to
him
,
forbade
him
,
even
for
his
life
,
to
disclose
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
evidence
that
had
been
warped
and
wrested
from
the
young
lady
,
whose
anguish
in
giving
it
they
had
witnessed
,
came
to
nothing
,
involving
the
mere
little
innocent
gallantries
and
politenesses
likely
to
pass
between
any
young
gentleman
and
young
lady
<EOS>
so
thrown
together
;
---
with
the
exception
of
that
reference
to
George
Washington
,
which
was
altogether
too
extravagant
and
impossible
to
be
regarded
in
any
other
light
than
as
a
monstrous
joke
.
 
<EOS>
How
it
would
be
a
weakness
in
the
government
to
break
down
in
this
attempt
to
practise
for
popularity
on
the
lowest
national
antipathies
and
fears
,
and
therefore
Mr
Attorney
-
General
had
made
the
most
of
it
;
how
,
nevertheless
,
it
rested
upon
nothing
,
save
that
vile
and
infamous
character
of
evidence
too
often
disfiguring
such
cases
,
and
of
which
the
State
Trials
of
this
country
were
full
.
<EOS>
But
,
there
my
Lord
interposed
(
with
as
grave
a
face
as
if
it
had
not
been
true
)
,
saying
that
he
could
not
sit
upon
that
Bench
and
suffer
those
allusions
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Stryver
then
called
his
few
witnesses
,
and
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
had
next
to
attend
while
Mr
Attorney
-
General
turned
the
whole
suit
of
clothes
<EOS>
Mr
Stryver
had
fitted
on
the
jury
,
inside
out
;
showing
how
Barsad
and
Cly
were
even
a
hundred
times
better
than
he
had
thought
them
,
and
the
prisoner
a
hundred
times
worse
.
 
<EOS>
Lastly
,
came
my
Lord
himself
,
turning
the
suit
of
clothes
,
now
inside
out
,
now
outside
in
,
but
on
the
whole
decidedly
trimming
and
shaping
them
into
grave
-
clothes
for
the
prisoner
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
,
the
jury
turned
to
consider
,
and
the
great
flies
swarmed
again
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Carton
,
who
had
so
long
sat
looking
at
the
ceiling
of
the
court
,
changed
neither
his
place
nor
his
attitude
,
even
in
this
excitement
.
<EOS>
While
his
teamed
friend
,
Mr
Stryver
,
massing
his
papers
before
him
,
whispered
with
those
who
sat
near
,
and
from
time
to
time
glanced
anxiously
at
the
jury
;
while
all
the
spectators
moved
more
or
less
,
and
grouped
themselves
anew
;
while
even
my
Lord
himself
arose
from
his
seat
,
and
slowly
paced
up
and
down
his
platform
,
not
unattended
by
a
suspicion
in
the
minds
of
the
audience
that
his
state
was
feverish
;
this
one
man
sat
leaning
back
,
with
his
torn
gown
half
off
him
,
his
untidy
wig
put
on
just
as
it
had
happened
to
fight
on
his
head
after
its
removal
,
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
his
eyes
on
the
ceiling
as
they
had
been
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
Something
especially
reckless
in
his
demeanour
,
not
only
gave
him
a
disreputable
look
,
but
so
diminished
the
strong
resemblance
he
undoubtedly
bore
to
the
prisoner
(
which
his
momentary
earnestness
,
when
they
were
compared
together
,
had
strengthened
)
,
<EOS>
that
many
of
the
lookers
-
on
,
taking
note
of
him
now
,
said
to
one
another
they
would
hardly
have
thought
the
two
were
so
alike
.
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
made
the
observation
to
his
next
neighbour
,
and
added
,
"
I
'd
hold
half
a
guinea
that
HE
do
n't
get
no
law
-
work
to
do
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
look
like
the
sort
of
one
to
get
any
,
do
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
Yet
,
this
Mr
Carton
took
in
more
of
the
details
of
the
scene
than
he
appeared
to
take
in
;
for
now
,
when
Miss
Manette
's
head
dropped
upon
her
father
's
breast
,
he
was
the
first
to
see
it
,
and
to
say
audibly
:
"
Officer
!
<EOS>
look
to
that
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Help
the
gentleman
to
take
her
out
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
she
will
fall
!
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
much
commiseration
for
her
as
she
was
removed
,
and
much
sympathy
with
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
evidently
been
a
great
distress
to
him
,
to
have
the
days
of
his
imprisonment
recalled
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
shown
strong
internal
agitation
when
he
was
questioned
,
and
that
pondering
or
brooding
look
which
made
him
old
,
had
been
upon
him
,
like
a
heavy
cloud
,
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
passed
out
,
the
jury
,
who
had
turned
back
and
paused
a
moment
,
spoke
,
through
their
foreman
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
not
agreed
,
and
wished
to
retire
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
(
perhaps
with
George
Washington
on
his
mind
)
showed
some
surprise
that
they
were
not
agreed
,
but
signified
his
pleasure
that
they
should
retire
under
watch
and
ward
,
and
retired
himself
.
 
<EOS>
The
trial
had
lasted
all
day
,
and
the
lamps
in
the
court
were
now
being
lighted
.
 
<EOS>
It
began
to
be
rumoured
that
the
jury
would
be
out
a
long
while
.
 
<EOS>
The
spectators
dropped
off
to
get
refreshment
,
and
the
prisoner
withdrew
to
the
back
of
the
dock
,
and
sat
down
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
,
who
had
gone
out
when
the
young
lady
and
her
father
went
out
,
now
reappeared
,
and
beckoned
to
Jerry
:
 
who
,
in
the
slackened
interest
,
could
easily
get
near
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jerry
,
if
you
wish
to
take
something
to
eat
,
you
can
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
keep
in
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
sure
to
hear
when
the
jury
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
a
moment
behind
them
,
for
I
want
you
to
take
the
verdict
back
to
the
bank
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
quickest
messenger
I
know
,
and
will
get
to
Temple
Bar
long
before
I
can
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jerry
had
just
enough
forehead
to
knuckle
,
and
he
knuckled
it
in
acknowedgment
of
this
communication
and
a
shilling
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Carton
came
up
at
the
moment
,
and
touched
Mr
Lorry
on
the
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
is
the
young
lady
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
greatly
distressed
;
but
her
father
is
comforting
her
,
and
she
feels
the
better
for
being
out
of
court
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
the
prisoner
so
.
 
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
do
for
a
respectable
bank
gentleman
like
you
,
to
be
seen
speaking
to
him
publicly
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
reddened
as
if
he
were
conscious
of
having
debated
the
point
in
his
mind
,
and
Mr
Carton
made
his
way
to
the
outside
of
the
bar
.
<EOS>
The
way
out
of
court
lay
in
that
direction
,
and
Jerry
followed
him
,
all
eyes
,
ears
,
and
spikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Darnay
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
prisoner
came
forward
directly
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
naturally
be
anxious
to
hear
of
the
witness
,
Miss
Manette
.
<EOS>
She
will
do
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
seen
the
worst
of
her
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
deeply
sorry
to
have
been
the
cause
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Could
you
tell
her
so
for
me
,
with
my
fervent
acknowledgments
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
if
you
ask
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Carton
's
manner
was
so
careless
as
to
be
almost
insolent
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
,
half
turned
from
the
prisoner
,
lounging
with
his
elbow
against
the
bar
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
ask
it
.
 
<EOS>
Accept
my
cordial
thanks
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
"
said
Carton
,
still
only
half
turned
towards
him
,
"
do
you
expect
,
Mr
Darnay
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
worst
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
wisest
thing
to
expect
,
and
the
likeliest
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
think
their
withdrawing
is
in
your
favour
.
"
   
<EOS>
Loitering
on
the
way
out
of
court
not
being
allowed
,
Jerry
heard
no
more
:
 
but
left
them
---
so
like
each
other
in
feature
,
so
unlike
each
other
in
manner
---
standing
side
by
side
,
both
reflected
in
the
glass
above
them
.
   
<EOS>
An
hour
and
a
half
limped
heavily
away
in
the
thief
-
and
-
rascal
crowded
passages
below
,
even
though
assisted
off
with
mutton
pies
and
ale
.
<EOS>
The
hoarse
messenger
,
uncomfortably
seated
on
a
form
after
taking
that
refection
,
had
dropped
into
a
doze
,
when
a
loud
murmur
and
a
rapid
tide
of
people
setting
up
the
stairs
that
led
to
the
court
,
carried
him
along
with
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jerry
!
 
<EOS>
Jerry
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
was
already
calling
at
the
door
when
he
got
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
fight
to
get
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
Here
I
am
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
handed
him
a
paper
through
the
throng
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quick
!
 
<EOS>
Have
you
got
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Hastily
written
on
the
paper
was
the
word
"
AQUITTED
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
sent
the
message
,
"
Recalled
to
Life
,
"
again
,
"
muttered
Jerry
,
as
he
turned
,
"
I
should
have
known
what
you
meant
,
this
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
no
opportunity
of
saying
,
or
so
much
as
thinking
,
anything
else
,
until
he
was
clear
of
the
Old
Bailey
;
for
,
the
crowd
came
pouring
out
with
a
vehemence
that
nearly
took
him
off
his
legs
,
and
a
loud
buzz
swept
into
the
street
as
if
the
baffled
blue
-
flies
were
dispersing
in
search
of
other
carrion
.
    
Chapter

<EOS>
Congratulatory
 
From
the
dimly
-
lighted
passages
of
the
court
,
the
last
sediment
of
the
human
stew
that
had
been
boiling
there
all
day
,
was
straining
off
,
when
Doctor
Manette
,
Lucie
Manette
,
his
daughter
,
Mr
Lorry
,
the
solicitor
for
the
defence
,
and
its
counsel
,
Mr
Stryver
,
stood
gathered
<EOS>
round
Mr
Charles
Darnay
---
just
released
---
congratulating
him
on
his
escape
from
death
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
difficult
by
a
far
brighter
light
,
to
recognise
in
Doctor
Manette
,
intellectual
of
face
and
upright
of
bearing
,
the
shoemaker
of
the
garret
in
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
no
one
could
have
looked
at
him
twice
,
without
looking
again
:
 
even
though
the
opportunity
of
observation
had
not
extended
to
the
mournful
cadence
of
his
low
grave
voice
,
and
to
the
abstraction
that
overclouded
him
fitfully
,
without
any
apparent
reason
.
 
<EOS>
While
one
external
cause
,
and
that
a
reference
to
his
long
lingering
agony
,
would
always
---
as
on
the
trial
---
evoke
this
condition
from
the
depths
of
his
soul
<EOS>
,
it
was
also
in
its
nature
to
arise
of
itself
,
and
to
draw
a
gloom
over
him
,
as
incomprehensible
to
those
unacquainted
with
his
story
as
if
they
had
seen
the
shadow
of
the
actual
Bastille
thrown
upon
him
by
a
summer
sun
,
when
the
substance
was
three
hundred
miles
away
.
   
<EOS>
Only
his
daughter
had
the
power
of
charming
this
black
brooding
from
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
the
golden
thread
that
united
him
to
a
Past
beyond
his
misery
,
and
to
a
Present
beyond
his
misery
:
 
and
the
sound
of
her
voice
,
the
light
of
her
face
,
the
touch
of
her
hand
,
had
a
strong
beneficial
influence
with
him
almost
always
.
 
<EOS>
Not
absolutely
always
,
for
she
could
recall
some
occasions
on
which
her
power
had
failed
;
but
they
were
few
and
slight
,
and
she
believed
them
over
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Darnay
had
kissed
her
hand
fervently
and
gratefully
,
and
had
turned
to
Mr
Stryver
,
whom
he
warmly
thanked
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Stryver
,
a
man
of
little
more
than
thirty
,
but
looking
twenty
years
older
than
he
was
,
stout
,
loud
,
red
,
bluff
,
and
free
from
any
drawback
of
delicacy
,
had
a
pushing
way
of
shouldering
himself
(
morally
and
physically
)
into
companies
and
conversations
,
that
argued
well
for
his
shouldering
his
way
up
in
life
.
   
<EOS>
He
still
had
his
wig
and
gown
on
,
and
he
said
,
squaring
himself
at
his
late
client
to
that
degree
that
he
squeezed
the
innocent
Mr
Lorry
clean
out
of
the
group
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
have
brought
you
off
with
honour
,
Mr
Darnay
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
infamous
prosecution
,
grossly
infamous
;
but
not
the
less
likely
to
succeed
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
laid
me
under
an
obligation
to
you
for
life
---
in
two
senses
,
"
said
his
late
client
,
taking
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
my
best
for
you
,
Mr
Darnay
;
and
my
best
is
as
good
as
another
man
's
<EOS>
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
clearly
being
incumbent
on
some
one
to
say
,
"
Much
better
,
"
Mr
Lorry
said
it
;
perhaps
not
quite
disinterestedly
,
but
with
the
interested
object
of
squeezing
himself
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
think
so
?
"
said
Mr
Stryver
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
!
you
have
been
present
all
day
,
and
you
ought
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
man
of
business
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
as
such
,
"
quoth
Mr
Lorry
,
whom
the
counsel
learned
in
the
law
had
now
shouldered
back
into
the
group
,
just
as
he
had
previously
shouldered
him
out
of
it
---
"
as
such
I
will
appeal
to
Doctor
Manette
,
to
break
up
this
conference
and
order
us
all
to
our
homes
.
<EOS>
Miss
Lucie
looks
ill
,
Mr
Darnay
has
had
a
terrible
day
,
we
are
worn
out
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Speak
for
yourself
,
Mr
Lorry
,
"
said
Stryver
;
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
night
's
work
to
do
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Speak
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
speak
for
myself
,
"
answered
Mr
Lorry
,
"
and
for
Mr
Darnay
,
and
for
Miss
Lucie
,
and
---
Miss
Lucie
,
<EOS>
do
you
not
think
I
may
speak
for
us
all
?
"
<EOS>
He
asked
her
the
question
pointedly
,
and
with
a
glance
at
her
father
.
   
<EOS>
His
face
had
become
frozen
,
as
it
were
,
in
a
very
curious
look
at
Darnay
:
 
an
intent
look
,
deepening
into
a
frown
of
dislike
and
distrust
,
not
even
unmixed
with
fear
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
strange
expression
on
him
his
thoughts
had
wandered
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
father
,
"
said
Lucie
,
softly
laying
her
hand
on
his
.
   
<EOS>
He
slowly
shook
the
shadow
off
,
and
turned
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
go
home
,
my
father
?
"
   
<EOS>
With
a
long
breath
,
he
answered
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
friends
of
the
acquitted
prisoner
had
dispersed
,
under
the
impression
---
which
he
himself
had
originated
---
that
he
would
not
be
released
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
lights
were
nearly
all
extinguished
in
the
passages
,
the
iron
gates
were
being
closed
with
a
jar
and
a
rattle
,
and
the
dismal
place
was
deserted
until
to
-
morrow
morning
's
interest
of
gallows
,
pillory
,
whipping
-
post
,
and
branding
-
iron
,
should
repeople
it
.
 
<EOS>
Walking
between
her
father
and
Mr
Darnay
,
Lucie
Manette
passed
into
the
open
air
.
 
<EOS>
A
hackney
-
coach
was
called
,
and
the
father
and
daughter
departed
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Stryver
had
left
them
in
the
passages
,
to
shoulder
his
way
back
to
the
robing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
Another
person
,
who
had
not
joined
the
group
,
or
interchanged
a
word
with
any
one
of
them
,
but
who
had
been
leaning
against
the
wall
where
its
shadow
was
darkest
,
had
silently
strolled
out
after
the
rest
,
and
had
looked
on
until
the
coach
drove
away
.
<EOS>
He
now
stepped
up
to
where
Mr
Lorry
and
Mr
Darnay
stood
upon
the
pavement
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
,
Mr
Lorry
!
 
<EOS>
Men
of
business
may
speak
to
Mr
Darnay
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
Nobody
had
made
any
acknowledgment
of
Mr
Carton
's
part
in
the
day
's
proceedings
;
nobody
had
known
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
unrobed
,
and
was
none
the
better
for
it
in
appearance
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
knew
what
a
conflict
goes
on
in
the
business
mind
,
when
the
business
mind
is
divided
between
good
-
natured
impulse
and
business
appearances
,
you
would
be
amused
,
Mr
Darnay
.
"
   
Mr
Lorry
reddened
,
and
said
,
warmly
,
"
You
have
mentioned
that
before
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
We
men
of
business
,
who
serve
a
House
,
are
not
our
own
masters
.
<EOS>
We
have
to
think
of
the
House
more
than
ourselves
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
\I\
know
,
\I\
know
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Carton
,
carelessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
nettled
,
Mr
Lorry
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
as
good
as
another
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
:
<EOS>
better
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
And
indeed
,
sir
,
"
pursued
Mr
Lorry
,
not
minding
him
,
"
I
really
do
n't
know
what
you
have
to
do
with
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
'll
excuse
me
,
as
very
much
your
elder
,
for
saying
so
,
I
really
do
n't
know
that
it
is
your
business
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Business
!
 
<EOS>
Bless
you
,
\I\
have
no
business
,
"
said
Mr
Carton
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
pity
you
have
not
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
,
too
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
,
"
pursued
Mr
Lorry
,
"
perhaps
you
would
attend
to
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
love
you
,
no
!
<EOS>
---
I
should
n't
,
"
said
Mr
Carton
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Mr
Lorry
,
thoroughly
heated
by
his
indifference
,
"
business
is
a
very
good
thing
,
and
a
very
respectable
thing
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
sir
,
if
business
imposes
its
restraints
and
its
silences
and
impediments
,
Mr
Darnay
as
a
young
gentleman
of
generosity
knows
how
to
make
allowance
for
that
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Darnay
,
good
night
,
God
bless
you
,
sir
!
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
been
this
day
preserved
for
a
prosperous
and
happy
life
.
<EOS>
---
Chair
there
!
"
   
<EOS>
Perhaps
a
little
angry
with
himself
,
as
well
as
with
the
barrister
,
Mr
Lorry
bustled
into
the
chair
,
and
was
carried
off
to
Tellson
's
.
<EOS>
Carton
,
who
smelt
of
port
wine
,
and
did
not
appear
to
be
quite
sober
,
laughed
then
,
and
turned
to
Darnay
:
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
strange
chance
that
throws
you
and
me
together
.
 
<EOS>
This
must
be
a
strange
night
to
you
,
standing
alone
here
with
your
counterpart
on
these
street
stones
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
seem
yet
,
"
returned
Charles
Darnay
,
"
to
belong
to
this
world
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
wonder
at
it
;
it
's
not
so
long
since
you
were
pretty
far
advanced
on
your
way
to
another
.
 
<EOS>
You
speak
faintly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
think
I
AM
faint
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
why
the
devil
do
n't
you
dine
?
 
<EOS>
I
dined
,
myself
,
while
those
numskulls
were
deliberating
which
world
you
should
belong
to
---
this
,
or
some
other
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
show
you
the
nearest
tavern
to
dine
well
at
.
"
   
<EOS>
Drawing
his
arm
through
his
own
,
he
took
him
down
Ludgate
-
hill
to
Fleet
-
street
,
and
<EOS>
so
,
up
a
covered
way
,
into
a
tavern
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
they
were
shown
into
a
little
room
,
where
Charles
Darnay
was
soon
recruiting
his
strength
with
a
good
plain
dinner
and
good
wine
:
 
while
Carton
sat
opposite
to
him
at
the
same
table
,
with
his
separate
bottle
of
port
before
him
,
and
his
fully
half
-
insolent
manner
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
feel
,
yet
,
that
you
belong
to
this
terrestrial
scheme
again
,
Mr
Darnay
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
frightfully
confused
regarding
time
and
place
;
but
I
am
so
far
mended
as
to
feel
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
an
immense
satisfaction
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
said
it
bitterly
,
and
filled
up
his
glass
again
:
 
which
was
a
large
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
me
,
the
greatest
desire
I
have
,
is
to
forget
that
I
belong
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
no
good
in
it
for
me
---
except
wine
like
this
---
nor
I
for
it
.
<EOS>
So
we
are
not
much
alike
in
that
particular
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
begin
to
think
we
are
not
much
alike
in
any
particular
,
you
and
I.
"
   
Confused
by
the
emotion
of
the
day
,
and
feeling
his
being
there
with
this
Double
of
coarse
deportment
,
to
be
like
a
dream
,
Charles
Darnay
was
at
a
loss
how
to
answer
;
finally
,
answered
not
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
your
dinner
is
done
,
"
Carton
presently
said
,
"
why
do
n't
you
call
a
health
,
Mr
Darnay
;
why
do
n't
you
give
your
toast
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
health
?
 
<EOS>
What
toast
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
's
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
It
ought
to
be
,
it
must
be
<EOS>
,
I
'll
swear
it
's
there
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Manette
,
then
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Manette
,
then
!
"
   
<EOS>
Looking
his
companion
full
in
the
face
while
he
drank
the
toast
,
Carton
flung
his
glass
over
his
shoulder
against
the
wall
,
where
it
shivered
to
pieces
;
then
,
rang
the
bell
,
and
ordered
in
another
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
fair
young
lady
to
hand
to
a
coach
in
the
dark
,
Mr
Darnay
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
ruing
his
new
goblet
.
   
<EOS>
A
slight
frown
and
a
laconic
"
Yes
,
"
were
the
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
fair
young
lady
to
be
pitied
by
and
wept
for
by
!
 
<EOS>
How
does
it
feel
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
worth
being
tried
for
one
's
life
,
to
be
the
object
of
such
sympathy
and
compassion
,
Mr
Darnay
?
"
   
<EOS>
Again
Darnay
answered
not
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
was
mightily
pleased
to
have
your
message
,
when
I
gave
it
her
.
<EOS>
Not
that
she
showed
she
was
pleased
,
but
I
suppose
she
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
allusion
served
as
a
timely
reminder
to
Darnay
that
this
disagreeable
companion
had
,
of
his
own
free
will
,
assisted
him
in
the
strait
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
the
dialogue
to
that
point
,
and
thanked
him
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
neither
want
any
thanks
,
nor
merit
any
,
"
was
the
careless
rejoinder
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
nothing
to
do
,
in
the
first
place
;
and
I
do
n't
know
why
I
did
it
,
in
the
second
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Darnay
,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Willingly
,
and
a
small
return
for
your
good
offices
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
I
particularly
like
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
Mr
Carton
,
"
returned
the
other
,
oddly
disconcerted
,
"
I
have
not
asked
myself
the
question
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
ask
yourself
the
question
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
acted
as
if
you
do
;
but
I
do
n't
think
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
\I\
do
n't
think
I
do
,
"
said
Carton
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
have
a
very
good
opinion
of
your
understanding
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nevertheless
,
"
pursued
Darnay
,
rising
to
ring
the
bell
,
"
there
is
nothing
in
that
,
I
hope
,
to
prevent
my
calling
the
reckoning
,
and
our
parting
without
ill
-
blood
on
either
side
.
"
   
<EOS>
Carton
rejoining
,
"
Nothing
in
life
!
"
<EOS>
Darnay
rang
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
call
the
whole
reckoning
?
"
said
Carton
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
answering
in
the
affirmative
,
"
Then
bring
me
another
pint
of
this
same
wine
,
drawer
,
and
come
and
wake
me
at
ten
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
bill
being
paid
,
Charles
Darnay
rose
and
wished
him
good
night
.
<EOS>
Without
returning
the
wish
,
Carton
rose
too
,
with
something
of
a
threat
of
defiance
in
his
manner
,
and
said
,
"
A
last
word
,
Mr
Darnay
:
you
think
I
am
drunk
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
have
been
drinking
,
Mr
Carton
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Think
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
I
have
been
drinking
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Since
I
must
say
so
,
I
know
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
shall
likewise
know
why
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
disappointed
drudge
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
care
for
no
man
on
earth
,
and
no
man
on
earth
cares
for
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Much
to
be
regretted
.
 
<EOS>
You
might
have
used
your
talents
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
May
be
so
,
Mr

Do
n't
let
your
sober
face
elate
you
,
however
;
you
do
n't
know
what
it
may
come
to

<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
When
he
was
left
alone
,
this
strange
being
took
up
a
candle
,
went
to
a
glass
that
hung
against
the
wall
,
and
surveyed
himself
minutely
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
particularly
like
the
man
?
"
<EOS>
he
muttered
,
at
his
own
image
;
"
why
should
you
particularly
like
a
man
who
resembles
you
?
 
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
in
you
to
like
;
you
know
that
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
confound
you
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
change
you
have
made
in
yourself
!
 
<EOS>
A
good
reason
for
taking
to
a
man
,
that
he
shows
you
what
you
have
fallen
away
from
,
and
what
you
might
have
been
!
 
<EOS>
Change
places
with
him
,
and
would
you
have
been
looked
at
by
those
blue
eyes
as
he
was
,
and
commiserated
by
that
agitated
face
as
he
was
?
 
<EOS>
Come
on
,
and
have
it
out
in
plain
words
!
 
<EOS>
You
hate
the
fellow
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
resorted
to
his
pint
of
wine
for
consolation
,
drank
it
all
in
a
few
minutes
,
and
fell
asleep
on
his
arms
,
with
his
hair
straggling
over
the
table
,
and
a
long
winding
-
sheet
in
the
candle
dripping
down
upon
him
.

Chapter

<EOS>
The
Jackal
 
<EOS>
Those
were
drinking
days
,
and
most
men
drank
hard
.
 
<EOS>
So
very
great
is
the
improvement
Time
has
brought
about
in
such
habits
,
that
a
moderate
statement
of
the
quantity
of
wine
and
punch
which
one
man
would
swallow
in
the
course
of
a
night
,
without
any
detriment
to
his
reputation
as
a
perfect
gentleman
,
would
seem
,
in
these
days
,
a
ridiculous
exaggeration
.
<EOS>
The
learned
profession
of
the
law
was
certainly
not
behind
any
other
learned
profession
in
its
Bacchanalian
propensities
;
neither
was
Mr
Stryver
,
already
fast
shouldering
his
way
to
a
large
and
lucrative
practice
,
behind
his
compeers
in
this
particular
,
any
more
than
in
the
drier
parts
of
the
legal
race
.
   
<EOS>
A
favourite
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
and
eke
at
the
Sessions
,
Mr
Stryver
had
begun
cautiously
to
hew
away
the
lower
staves
of
the
ladder
on
which
he
mounted
.
 
<EOS>
Sessions
and
Old
Bailey
had
now
to
summon
their
favourite
,
specially
,
to
their
longing
arms
;
and
shouldering
itself
towards
the
visage
of
the
Lord
Chief
Justice
in
the
Court
of
King
's
Bench
,
the
florid
countenance
of
Mr
Stryver
might
be
daily
seen
,
bursting
out
of
the
bed
of
wigs
,
like
a
great
sunflower
pushing
its
way
at
the
sun
from
among
a
rank
garden
-
full
of
flaring
companions
.
   
<EOS>
It
had
once
been
noted
at
the
Bar
,
that
while
Mr
Stryver
was
a
glib
man
,
and
an
unscrupulous
,
and
a
ready
,
and
a
bold
,
he
had
not
that
faculty
of
extracting
the
essence
from
a
heap
of
statements
,
which
is
among
the
most
striking
and
necessary
of
the
advocate
's
accomplishments
.
<EOS>
But
,
a
remarkable
improvement
came
upon
him
as
to
this
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
business
he
got
,
the
greater
his
power
seemed
to
grow
of
getting
at
its
pith
and
marrow
;
and
however
late
at
night
he
sat
carousing
with
Sydney
Carton
,
he
always
had
his
points
at
his
fingers
'
ends
in
the
morning
.
   
<EOS>
Sydney
Carton
,
idlest
and
most
unpromising
of
men
,
was
Stryver
's
great
ally
.
 
<EOS>
What
the
two
drank
together
,
between
Hilary
Term
and
Michaelmas
,
might
have
floated
a
king
's
ship
.
 
<EOS>
Stryver
never
had
a
case
in
hand
,
anywhere
,
but
Carton
was
there
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
staring
at
the
ceiling
of
the
court
;
they
went
the
same
Circuit
,
and
even
there
they
prolonged
their
usual
orgies
late
into
the
night
,
and
Carton
was
rumoured
to
be
seen
at
broad
day
,
going
home
stealthily
and
unsteadily
to
his
lodgings
,
like
a
dissipated
cat
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
it
began
to
get
about
,
among
such
as
were
interested
in
the
matter
,
that
although
Sydney
Carton
would
never
be
a
lion
,
he
was
an
amazingly
good
jackal
,
and
that
he
rendered
suit
and
service
to
Stryver
in
that
humble
capacity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ten
o'clock
,
sir
,
"
said
the
man
at
the
tavern
,
whom
he
had
charged
to
wake
him
---
"
ten
o'clock
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
WHAT
'S
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ten
o'clock
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
Ten
o'clock
at
night
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Your
honour
told
me
to
call
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
remember
.
 
<EOS>
Very
well
,
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
few
dull
efforts
to
get
to
sleep
again
,
which
the
man
dexterously
combated
by
stirring
the
fire
continuously
for
five
minutes
,
he
got
up
,
tossed
his
hat
on
,
and
walked
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
into
the
Temple
,
and
,
having
revived
himself
by
twice
pacing
the
pavements
of
King
's
Bench
-
walk
and
Paper
-
buildings
,
turned
into
the
Stryver
chambers
.
   
<EOS>
The
Stryver
clerk
,
who
never
assisted
at
these
conferences
,
had
gone
home
,
and
the
Stryver
principal
opened
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
his
slippers
on
,
and
a
loose
bed
-
gown
,
and
<EOS>
his
throat
was
bare
for
his
greater
ease
.
<EOS>
He
had
that
rather
wild
,
strained
,
seared
marking
about
the
eyes
,
which
may
be
observed
in
all
free
livers
of
his
class
,
from
the
portrait
of
Jeffries
downward
,
and
which
can
be
traced
,
under
various
disguises
of
Art
,
through
the
portraits
of
every
Drinking
Age
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
little
late
,
Memory
,
"
said
Stryver
.
   
<EOS>
"
About
the
usual
time
;
it
may
be
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
went
into
a
dingy
room
lined
with
books
and
littered
with
papers
,
where
there
was
a
blazing
fire
.
 
<EOS>
A
kettle
steamed
upon
the
hob
,
and
in
the
midst
of
the
wreck
of
papers
a
table
shone
,
with
plenty
of
wine
upon
it
,
and
brandy
,
and
rum
,
and
sugar
,
and
lemons
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
had
your
bottle
,
I
perceive
,
Sydney
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Two
to
-
night
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
dining
with
the
day
's
client
;
or
seeing
him
dine
<EOS>
---
it
's
all
one
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
was
a
rare
point
,
Sydney
,
that
you
brought
to
bear
upon
the
identification
.
 
<EOS>
How
did
you
come
by
it
?
 
<EOS>
When
did
it
strike
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
he
was
rather
a
handsome
fellow
,
and
I
thought
I
should
have
been
much
the
same
sort
of
fellow
,
if
I
had
had
any
luck
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Stryver
laughed
till
he
shook
his
precocious
paunch
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
and
your
luck
,
Sydney
!
 
<EOS>
Get
to
work
,
get
to
work
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sullenly
enough
,
the
jackal
loosened
his
dress
,
went
into
an
adjoining
room
,
and
came
back
with
a
large
jug
of
cold
water
,
a
basin
,
and
a
towel
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
Steeping
the
towels
in
the
water
,
and
partially
wringing
them
out
,
he
folded
them
on
his
head
in
a
manner
hideous
to
behold
,
sat
down
at
the
table
,
and
said
,
"
Now
I
am
ready
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
much
boiling
down
to
be
done
to
-
night
,
Memory
,
"
said
Mr
Stryver
,
gaily
,
as
he
looked
among
his
papers
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
much
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
two
sets
of
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Give
me
the
worst
first
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
they
are
,
Sydney
.
 
<EOS>
Fire
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
lion
then
composed
himself
on
his
back
on
a
sofa
on
one
side
of
the
drinking
-
table
,
while
the
jackal
sat
at
his
own
paper
-
bestrewn
table
proper
,
on
the
other
side
of
it
,
with
the
bottles
and
glasses
ready
to
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Both
resorted
to
the
drinking
-
table
without
stint
,
but
each
in
a
different
way
;
the
lion
for
the
most
part
reclining
with
his
hands
in
his
waistband
,
looking
at
the
fire
,
or
occasionally
flirting
with
some
lighter
document
;
the
jackal
,
with
knitted
brows
and
intent
face
,
so
deep
in
his
task
,
that
his
eyes
did
not
even
follow
the
hand
he
stretched
out
for
his
glass
---
which
often
groped
about
,
for
a
minute
or
more
,
before
it
found
the
glass
for
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
Two
or
three
times
,
the
matter
in
hand
became
so
knotty
,
that
the
jackal
found
it
imperative
on
him
to
get
up
,
and
steep
his
towels
anew
.
 
<EOS>
From
these
pilgrimages
to
the
jug
and
basin
,
he
returned
with
such
eccentricities
of
damp
headgear
as
no
words
can
describe
;
which
were
made
the
more
ludicrous
by
his
anxious
gravity
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
the
jackal
had
got
together
a
compact
repast
for
the
lion
,
and
proceeded
to
offer
it
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
lion
took
it
with
care
and
caution
,
made
his
selections
from
it
,
and
his
remarks
upon
it
,
and
the
jackal
assisted
both
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
repast
was
fully
discussed
,
the
lion
put
his
hands
in
his
waistband
again
,
and
lay
down
to
mediate
.
<EOS>
The
jackal
then
invigorated
himself
with
a
bum
for
his
throttle
,
and
a
fresh
application
to
his
head
,
and
applied
himself
to
the
collection
of
a
second
meal
;
this
was
administered
to
the
lion
in
the
same
manner
,
and
was
not
disposed
of
until
the
clocks
struck
three
in
the
morning
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
now
we
have
done
,
Sydney
,
fill
a
bumper
of
punch
,
"
said
Mr
Stryver
.
   
<EOS>
The
jackal
removed
the
towels
from
his
head
,
which
had
been
steaming
again
,
shook
himself
,
yawned
,
shivered
,
and
complied
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
were
very
sound
,
Sydney
,
in
the
matter
of
those
crown
witnesses
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
Every
question
told
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
always
am
sound
;
am
I
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
gainsay
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
has
roughened
your
temper
?
<EOS>
Put
some
punch
to
it
and
smooth
it
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
a
deprecatory
grunt
,
the
jackal
again
complied
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
old
Sydney
Carton
of
old
Shrewsbury
School
,
"
said
Stryver
,
nodding
his
head
over
him
as
he
reviewed
him
in
the
present
and
the
past
,
"
the
old
seesaw
Sydney
.
 
<EOS>
Up
one
minute
and
down
the
next
<EOS>
;
now
in
spirits
and
now
in
despondency
!
"
   
"
Ah
!
"
returned
the
other
,
sighing
:
 
"
yes
!
 
<EOS>
The
same
Sydney
,
with
the
same
luck
.
 
<EOS>
Even
then
,
I
did
exercises
for
other
boys
,
and
seldom
did
my
own
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
why
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
God
knows
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
my
way
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
sat
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
<EOS>
his
legs
stretched
out
before
him
,
looking
at
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
Carton
,
"
said
his
friend
,
squaring
himself
at
him
with
a
bullying
air
,
as
if
the
fire
-
grate
had
been
the
furnace
in
which
sustained
endeavour
was
forged
,
and
the
one
delicate
thing
to
be
done
for
the
old
Sydney
Carton
of
old
Shrewsbury
School
was
to
shoulder
him
into
it
,
<EOS>
"
your
way
is
,
and
always
was
,
a
lame
way
.
 
<EOS>
You
summon
no
energy
and
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
botheration
!
<EOS>
"
returned
Sydney
,
with
a
lighter
and
more
good
-
humoured
laugh
,
"
do
n't
YOU
be
moral
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
have
I
done
what
I
have
done
?
"
said
Stryver
;
"
how
do
I
do
what
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Partly
through
paying
me
to
help
you
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
not
worth
your
while
to
apostrophise
me
,
or
the
air
,
about
it
;
what
you
want
to
do
,
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
always
in
the
front
rank
,
and
I
was
always
behind
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
to
get
into
the
front
rank
;
I
was
not
born
there
,
was
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
present
at
the
ceremony
;
but
my
opinion
is
you
were
,
"
said
Carton
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
,
he
laughed
again
,
and
they
both
laughed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Before
Shrewsbury
,
and
at
Shrewsbury
,
and
ever
since
Shrewsbury
,
"
pursued
Carton
,
"
you
have
fallen
into
your
rank
,
and
I
have
fallen
into
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
we
were
fellow
-
students
in
the
Student
-
Quarter
of
Paris
,
picking
up
French
,
and
French
law
,
and
other
French
crumbs
that
we
did
n't
get
much
good
of
,
you
were
always
somewhere
,
and
I
was
always
nowhere
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
whose
fault
was
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
soul
,
I
am
not
sure
that
it
was
not
yours
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
always
driving
and
riving
and
shouldering
and
passing
,
to
that
restless
degree
that
I
had
no
chance
for
my
life
but
in
rust
and
repose
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
gloomy
thing
,
however
,
to
talk
about
one
's
own
past
,
with
the
day
breaking
.
 
<EOS>
Turn
me
in
some
other
direction
before
I
go

<EOS>
"

Well

Pledge
me

pretty

"
Are

<EOS>
Apparently
not

for
he
became
gloomy
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pretty

"
he
muttered
,
looking
down
into
his

"
I

The

No

Why

Rot
the

<EOS>
Who
made
the

<EOS>
She
was
a
golden

haired
doll

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
Sydney

"
said
Mr
Stryver
,
looking
at
him
with
sharp
eyes
,
and
slowly
drawing
a
hand
across
his
florid
face
:
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
,
I
rather
thought
,
at
the
time
,
that
you
sympathised
with
the
golden
-
haired
doll
,
and
were
quick
to
see
what
happened
to
the
golden
-
haired
doll
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quick
to
see
what
happened
!
 
<EOS>
If
a
girl
,
doll
or
no
doll
,
swoons
within
a
yard
or
two
of
a
man
's
nose
,
he
can
see
it
without
a
perspective
-
glass
.
 
<EOS>
I
pledge
you
,
but
I
deny
the
beauty
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
'll
have
no
more
drink
;
I
'll
get
to
bed

"
   
<EOS>
When
his
host
followed
him
out
on
the
staircase
with
a
candle
,
to
light
him
down
the
stairs
,
the
day
was
coldly
looking
in
through
its
grimy
windows
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
got
out
of
the
house
,
the
air
was
cold
and
sad
,
the
dull
sky
overcast
,
the
river
dark
and
dim
,
the
whole
scene
like
a
lifeless
desert
.
 
<EOS>
And
wreaths
of
dust
were
spinning
round
and
round
before
the
morning
blast
,
as
if
the
desert
-
sand
had
risen
far
away
,
and
the
first
spray
of
it
in
its
advance
had
begun
to
overwhelm
the
city
.
   
<EOS>
Waste
forces
within
him
,
and
a
desert
all
around
,
this
man
stood
still
on
his
way
across
a
silent
terrace
,
and
saw
for
a
moment
,
lying
in
the
wilderness
before
him
,
a
mirage
of
honourable
ambition
,
self
-
denial
,
and
perseverance
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
fair
city
of
this
vision
,
there
were
airy
galleries
from
which
the
loves
and
graces
looked
upon
him
,
gardens
in
which
the
fruits
of
life
hung
ripening
,
waters
of
Hope
that
sparkled
in
his
sight
.
 
<EOS>
A
moment
,
and
it
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Climbing
to
a
high
chamber
in
a
well
of
houses
,
he
threw
himself
down
in
his
clothes
on
a
neglected
bed
,
and
its
pillow
was
wet
with
wasted
tears
.
   
<EOS>
Sadly
,
sadly
,
the
sun
rose
;
it
rose
upon
no
sadder
sight
than
the
man
of
good
abilities
and
good
emotions
,
incapable
of
their
directed
exercise
,
incapable
of
his
own
help
and
his
own
happiness
,
sensible
of
the
blight
on
him
,
and
resigning
himself
to
let
it
eat
him
away
.

Hundreds
of
People
 
<EOS>
The
quiet
lodgings
of
Doctor
Manette
were
in
a
quiet
street
-
corner
not
far
from
Soho
-
square
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
afternoon
of
a
certain
fine
Sunday
when
the
waves
of
four
months
had
roiled
over
the
trial
for
treason
,
and
carried
it
,
as
to
the
public
interest
and
memory
,
far
out
to
sea
,
Mr
Jarvis
Lorry
walked
along
the
sunny
streets
from
Clerkenwell
where
he
lived
,
on
his
way
to
dine
with
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
After
several
relapses
into
business
-
absorption
,
Mr
Lorry
had
become
the
Doctor
's
friend
,
and
the
quiet
street
-
corner
was
the
sunny
part
of
his
life
.
   
<EOS>
On
this
certain
fine
Sunday
,
Mr
Lorry
walked
towards
Soho
,
early
in
the
afternoon
,
for
three
reasons
of
habit
.
 
<EOS>
Firstly
,
because
,
on
fine
Sundays
,
he
often
walked
out
,
before
dinner
,
with
the
Doctor
and
Lucie
;
secondly
,
because
,
on
unfavourable
Sundays
,
he
was
accustomed
to
be
with
them
as
the
family
friend
,
talking
,
reading
,
looking
out
of
window
,
and
generally
getting
through
the
day
;
thirdly
,
because
he
happened
to
have
his
own
little
shrewd
doubts
to
solve
,
and
knew
how
the
ways
of
the
Doctor
's
household
pointed
to
that
time
as
a
likely
time
for
solving
them
.
   
<EOS>
A
quainter
corner
than
the
corner
where
the
Doctor
lived
,
was
not
to
be
found
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
way
through
it
,
and
the
front
windows
of
the
Doctor
's
lodgings
commanded
a
pleasant
little
vista
of
street
that
had
a
congenial
air
of
retirement
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
few
buildings
then
,
north
of
the
Oxford
-
road
,
and
forest
-
trees
flourished
,
and
wild
flowers
grew
,
and
the
hawthorn
blossomed
,
in
the
now
vanished
fields
.
<EOS>
As
a
consequence
,
country
airs
circulated
in
Soho
with
vigorous
freedom
,
instead
of
languishing
into
the
parish
like
stray
paupers
without
a
settlement
;
and
there
was
many
a
good
south
wall
,
not
far
off
,
on
which
the
peaches
ripened
in
their
season
.
   
<EOS>
The
summer
light
struck
into
the
corner
brilliantly
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
;
but
,
when
the
streets
grew
hot
,
the
corner
was
in
shadow
,
though
not
in
shadow
so
remote
but
that
you
could
see
beyond
it
into
a
glare
of
brightness
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
cool
spot
,
staid
but
cheerful
,
a
wonderful
place
for
echoes
,
and
a
very
harbour
from
the
raging
streets
.
   
<EOS>
There
ought
to
have
been
a
tranquil
bark
in
such
an
anchorage
,
and
there
was
.
 
<EOS>
The
Doctor
occupied
two
floors
of
a
large
stiff
house
,
where
several
callings
purported
to
be
pursued
by
day
,
but
whereof
<EOS>
little
was
audible
any
day
,
and
which
was
shunned
by
all
of
them
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
building
at
the
back
,
attainable
by
a
courtyard
where
a
plane
-
tree
rustled
its
green
leaves
,
church
-
organs
claimed
to
be
made
,
and
silver
to
be
chased
,
and
likewise
gold
to
be
beaten
by
some
mysterious
giant
who
had
a
golden
arm
starting
out
of
the
wall
of
the
front
hall
---
as
if
he
had
beaten
himself
precious
,
and
menaced
a
similar
conversion
of
all
visitors
.
 
<EOS>
Very
little
of
these
trades
,
or
of
a
lonely
lodger
rumoured
to
live
up
-
stairs
,
or
of
a
dim
coach
-
trimming
maker
asserted
to
have
a
counting
-
house
below
,
was
ever
heard
or
seen
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
,
a
stray
workman
putting
his
coat
on
,
traversed
the
hall
,
or
a
stranger
peered
about
there
,
or
a
distant
clink
was
heard
across
the
courtyard
,
or
a
thump
from
the
golden
giant
.
 
<EOS>
These
,
however
,
were
only
the
exceptions
required
to
prove
the
rule
that
the
sparrows
in
the
plane
-
tree
behind
the
house
,
and
the
echoes
in
the
corner
before
it
,
had
their
own
way
from
Sunday
morning
unto
Saturday
night
.
   
<EOS>
Doctor
Manette
received
such
patients
here
as
his
old
reputation
,
and
its
revival
in
the
floating
whispers
of
his
story
,
brought
him
.
<EOS>
His
scientific
knowledge
,
and
his
vigilance
and
skill
in
conducting
ingenious
experiments
,
brought
him
otherwise
into
moderate
request
,
and
he
earned
as
much
as
he
wanted
.
   
<EOS>
These
things
were
within
Mr
Jarvis
Lorry
's
knowledge
,
thoughts
,
and
notice
,
when
he
rang
the
door
-
bell
of
the
tranquil
house
in
the
corner
,
on
the
fine
Sunday
afternoon
.
   
<EOS>
"

Manette

<EOS>
Expected

"
   
<EOS>
Possibly
at

,
but
of
a
certainty
impossible
for
handmaid
to
anticipate
intentions
of
Miss
Pross
,
as
to
admission
or
denial
of
the
fact
.
   
<EOS>
"
As
I
am
at
home
myself
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
"
I
'll
go
upstairs

<EOS>
Although
the
Doctor
's
daughter
had
known
nothing
of
the
country
of
her
birth
,
she
appeared
to
have
innately
derived
from
it
that
ability
to
make
much
of
little
means
,
which
is
one
of
its
most
useful
and
most
agreeable
characteristics
.
 
<EOS>
Simple
as
the
furniture
was
,
it
was
set
off
by
so
many
little
adornments
,
of
no
value
but
for
their
taste
and
fancy
,
that
its
effect
was
delightful
.
 
<EOS>
The
disposition
of
everything
in
the
rooms
,
from
the
largest
object
to
the
least
;
the
arrangement
of
colours
,
the
elegant
variety
and
contrast
obtained
by
thrift
in
trifles
,
by
delicate
hands
,
clear
eyes
,
and
good
sense
;
were
at
once
so
pleasant
in
themselves
,
and
so
expressive
of
their
originator
,
that
,
as
Mr
Lorry
stood
looking
about
him
,
the
very
chairs
and
tables
seemed
to
ask
him
,
with
something
of
that
peculiar
expression
which
he
knew
so
well
by
this
time
,
whether
he
approved
?
   
<EOS>
There
were
three
rooms
on
a
floor
,
and
,
the
doors
by
which
they
communicated
being
put
open
that
the
air
might
pass
freely
through
them
all
,
Mr
Lorry
,
smilingly
observant
of
that
fanciful
resemblance
which
he
detected
all
around
him
,
walked
from
one
to
another
.
<EOS>
The
first
was
the
best
room
,
and
in
it
were
Lucie
's
birds
,
and
flowers
,
and
books
,
and
desk
,
and
work
-
table
,
and
box
of
water
-
colours
;
the
second
was
the
Doctor
's
consulting
-
room
,
used
also
as
the
dining
-
room
;
the
third
,
changingly
speckled
by
the
rustle
of
the
plane
-
tree
in
the
yard
,
was
the
Doctor
's
bedroom
,
and
there
,
in
a
corner
,
stood
the
disused
shoemaker
's
bench
and
tray
of
tools
,
much
as
it
had
stood
on
the
fifth
floor
of
the
dismal
house
by
the
wine
-
shop
,
in
the
suburb
of
Saint
Antoine
in
Paris
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
pausing
in
his
looking
about
,
"
that
he
keeps
that
reminder
of
his
sufferings
about
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
why
wonder
at
that
?
<EOS>
"
was
the
abrupt
inquiry
that
made
him
start
.
   
<EOS>
It
proceeded
from
Miss
Pross
,
the
wild
red
woman
,
strong
of
hand
,
whose
acquaintance
he
had
first
made
at
the
Royal
George
Hotel
at
Dover
,
and
had
since
improved
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
thought
---
"
Mr
Lorry
began
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
 
<EOS>
You
'd
have
thought
!
"
said
Miss
Pross
;
and
Mr
Lorry
left
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
inquired
that
lady
then
---
sharply
,
and
yet
as
if
to
express
that
she
bore
him
no
malice
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
pretty
well
,
I
thank
you
,
"
answered
Mr
Lorry
,
with
meekness
;
"
how
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
to
boast
of
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
indeed
!
"
said
Miss
Pross
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
much
put
out
about
my
Ladybird
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
For
gracious
sake
say
something
else
besides
"
indeed
,
"
or
you
'll
fidget
me
to
death
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
:
 
whose
character
(
dissociated
from
stature
)
was
shortness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
then
?
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
as
an
amendment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
is
bad
enough
,
"
returned
Miss
Pross
,
"
but
better
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
am
very
much
put
out
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
the
cause
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
dozens
of
people
who
are
not
at
all
worthy
of
Ladybird
,
to
come
here
looking
after
her
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
.
   
<EOS>
"
DO
dozens
come
for
that
purpose
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hundreds
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
characteristic
of
this
lady
(
as
of
some
other
people
before
her
time
and
since
)
that
whenever
her
original
proposition
was
questioned
,
she
exaggerated
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
as
the
safest
remark
he
could
think
of
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
lived
with
the
darling
---
or
the
darling
has
lived
with
me
,
and
paid
me
for
it
;
which
she
certainly
should
never
have
done
,
you
may
take
your
affidavit
,
if
I
could
have
afforded
to
keep
either
myself
or
her
for
nothing
---
since
she
was
ten
years
old
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
's
really
very
hard
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
.
   
<EOS>
Not
seeing
with
precision
what
was
very
hard
,
Mr
Lorry
shook
his
head
;
using
that
important
part
of
himself
as
a
sort
of
fairy
cloak
that
would
fit
anything
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
sorts
of
people
who
are
not
in
the
least
degree
worthy
of
the
pet
,
are
always
turning
up
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
you
began
it
---
"
   
"
\I\
began
it
,
Miss
Pross
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
Who
brought
her
father
to
life
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
If
THAT
was
beginning
it
---
"
said
Mr
Lorry
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
n't
ending
it
,
I
suppose
?
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
when
you
began
it
,
it
was
hard
enough
;
not
that
I
have
any
fault
to
find
with
Doctor
Manette
,
except
that
he
is
not
worthy
of
such
a
daughter
,
which
is
no
imputation
on
him
,
for
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
anybody
should
be
,
under
any
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
ready
is
doubly
and
trebly
hard
to
have
crowds
and
multitudes
of
people
turning
up
after
him
<EOS>
(
I
could
have

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
knew
Miss
Pross
to
be
very
jealous
,
but
he
also
knew
her
by
this
time
to
be
,
beneath
the
service
of
her
eccentricity
,
one
of
those
unselfish
creatures
---
found
only
among
women
---
who
will
,
for
pure
love
and
admiration
,
bind
themselves
willing
slaves
,
to
youth
when
they
have
lost
it
,
to
beauty
that
they
never
had
,
to
accomplishments
that
they
were
never
fortunate
enough
to
gain
,
to
bright
hopes
that
never
shone
upon
their
own
sombre
lives
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
enough
of
the
world
to
know
that
there
is
nothing
in
it
better
than
the
faithful
service
of
the
heart
;
so
rendered
and
so
free
from
any
mercenary
taint
<EOS>
,
he
had
such
an
exalted
respect
for
it
,
that
in
the
retributive
arrangements
made
by
his
own
mind
---
we
all
make
such
arrangements
,
more
or
less
---
he
stationed
Miss
Pross
much
nearer
to
the
lower
Angels
than
many
ladies
immeasurably
better
got
up
both
by
Nature
and
Art
,
who
had
balances
at
Tellson
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
never
was
,
nor
will
be
,
but
one
man
worthy
of
Ladybird
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
;
"
and
that
was
my
brother
Solomon
,
if
he
had
n't
made
a
mistake
in
life
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Here
again
:
 
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
's
inquiries
into
Miss
Pross
's
personal
history
had
established
the
fact
that
her
brother
Solomon
was
a
heartless
scoundrel
who
had
stripped
her
of
everything
she
possessed
,
as
a
stake
to
speculate
with
,
and
had
abandoned
her
in
her
poverty
for
evermore
,
with
no
touch
of
compunction
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pross
's
fidelity
of
belief
in
Solomon
(
deducting
a
mere
trifle
for
this
slight
mistake
)
was
quite
a
serious
matter
with
Mr
Lorry
,
and
had
its
weight
in
his
good
opinion
of
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
As
we
happen
to
be
alone
for
the
moment
,
and
are
both
people
of
business
,
"
he
said
,
when
they
had
got
back
to
the
drawing
-
room
and
had
sat
down
there
in
friendly
relations
,
"
let
me
ask
you
---
does
the
Doctor
,
in
talking
with
Lucie
,
never
refer
to
the
shoemaking
time
,
yet
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
yet
keeps
that
bench
and
those
tools
beside
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
returned
Miss
Pross
,
shaking
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
say
he
do
n't
refer
to
it
within
himself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
believe
that
he
thinks
of
it
much
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
imagine
---
<EOS>
"
Mr
Lorry
had
begun
,
when
Miss
Pross
took
him
up
short
with
:
   
<EOS>
"
Never
imagine
anything
.
 
<EOS>
Have
no
imagination
at
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
stand
corrected
;
do
you
suppose
---
you
go
so
far
as
to
suppose
,
sometimes
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
and
then
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
suppose
,
"
Mr
Lorry
went
on
,
with
a
laughing
twinkle
in
his
bright
eye
,
as
it
looked
kindly
at
her
,
"
that
Doctor
Manette
has
any
theory
of
his
own
,
preserved
through
all
those
years
,
relative
to
the
cause
of
his
being
so
oppressed
;
perhaps
,
even
to
the
name
of
his
oppressor
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
anything
about
it
but
<EOS>
what
Ladybird
tells
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
is
---
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
she
thinks
he
has
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
do
n't
be
angry
at
my
asking
all
these
questions
;
because
I
am
a
mere
dull
man
of
business
,
and
you
are
a
woman
of
business
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dull
?
"
<EOS>
Miss
Pross
inquired
,
with
placidity
.
   
<EOS>
Rather
wishing
his
modest
adjective
away
,
Mr
Lorry
replied
,
"
No
,
no
,
no
.
<EOS>
Surely
not
.
 
<EOS>
To
return
to
business
:
---
Is
it
not
remarkable
that
Doctor
Manette
,
unquestionably
innocent
of
any
crane
as
we
are
all
well
assured
he
is
,
should
never
touch
upon
that
question
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
with
me
,
though
he
had
business
relations
with
me
many
years
ago
,
and
we
are
now
intimate
;
I
will
say
with
the
fair
daughter
to
whom
he
is
so
devotedly
attached
,
and
who
is
so
devotedly
attached
to
him
?
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
Miss
Pross
,
I
do
n't
approach
the
topic
with
you
,
out
of
curiosity
,
but
out
of
zealous
interest
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
To
the
best
of
my
understanding
,
and
bad
's
the
best
,
you
'll
tell
me
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
softened
by
the
tone
of
the
apology
,
"
<EOS>
he
is
afraid
of
the
whole
subject
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Afraid
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
plain
enough
,
I
should
think
,
why
he
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
dreadful
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
that
,
his
loss
of
himself
grew
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
Not
knowing
how
he
lost
himself
,
or
how
he
recovered
himself
,
he
may
never
feel
certain
of
not
losing
himself
again
.
 
<EOS>
That
alone
would
n't
make
the
subject
pleasant
,
I
should
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
profounder
remark
than
Mr
Lorry
had
looked
for
.
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
fearful
to
reflect
upon
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
a
doubt
lurks
in
my
mind
,
Miss
Pross
,
whether
it
is
good
for
Doctor
Manette
to
have
that
suppression
always
shut
up
within
him
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
is
this
doubt
and
the
uneasiness
it
sometimes
causes
me
that
has
led
me
to
our
present
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
be
helped
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
shaking
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Touch
that
string
,
and
he
instantly
changes
for
the
worse
.
 
<EOS>
Better
leave
it
alone
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
must
leave
it
alone
,
like
or
no
like
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
he
gets
up
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
and
will
be
heard
,
by
us
overhead
there
,
walking
up
and
down
,
walking
up
and
down
,
in
his
room
.
<EOS>
Ladybird
has
learnt
to
know
then
that
his
mind
is
walking
up
and
down
,
walking
up
and
down
,
in
his
old
prison
.
 
<EOS>
She
hurries
to
him
,
and
they
go
on
together
,
walking
up
and
down
,
walking
up
and
down
,
until
he
is
composed
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
never
says
a
word
of
the
true
reason
of
his
restlessness
,
to
her
,
and
she
finds
it
best
not
to
hint
at
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
In
silence
they
go
walking
up
and
down
together
,
walking
up
and
down
together
,
till
her
love
and
company
have
brought
him
to
himself
.
"
   
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
Miss
Pross
's
denial
of
her
own
imagination
,
there
was
a
perception
of
the
pain
of
being
monotonously
haunted
by
one
sad
idea
,
in
her
repetition
of
the
phrase
,
walking
up
and
down
,
which
testified
to
her
possessing
such
a
thing
.
   
<EOS>
The
corner
has
been
mentioned
as
a
wonderful
corner
for
echoes
;
it
had
begun
to
echo
so
resoundingly
to
the
tread
of
coming
feet
,
that
it
seemed
as
though
the
very
mention
of
that
weary
pacing
to
and
fro
had
set
it
going
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
they
are
!
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
rising
to
break
up
the
conference
;
"
and
now
we
shall
have
hundreds
of
people
pretty
soon
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
such
a
curious
corner
in
its
acoustical
properties
,
such
a
peculiar
Ear
of
a
place
,
that
as
Mr
Lorry
stood
at
the
open
window
,
looking
for
the
father
and
daughter
whose
steps
he
heard
,
he
fancied
they
would
never
approach
.
 
<EOS>
Not
only
would
the
echoes
die
away
,
as
though
the
steps
had
gone
;
but
,
echoes
of
other
steps
that
never
came
would
be
heard
in
their
stead
,
and
would
die
away
for
good
when
they
seemed
close
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
father
and
daughter
did
at
last
appear
,
and
Miss
Pross
was
ready
at
the
street
door
to
receive
them
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Pross
was
a
pleasant
sight
,
albeit
wild
,
and
red
,
and
grim
,
taking
off
her
darling
's
bonnet
when
she
came
up
-
stairs
,
and
touching
it
up
with
the
ends
of
her
handkerchief
,
and
blowing
the
dust
off
it
,
and
folding
her
mantle
ready
for
laying
by
,
and
smoothing
her
rich
hair
with
as
much
pride
as
she
could
possibly
have
taken
in
her
own
hair
if
she
had
been
the
vainest
and
handsomest
of
women
.
 
<EOS>
Her
darling
was
a
pleasant
sight
too
,
embracing
her
and
thanking
her
,
and
protesting
against
her
taking
so
much
trouble
for
her
---
<EOS>
which
last
she
only
dared
to
do
playfully
,
or
Miss
Pross
,
sorely
hurt
,
would
have
retired
to
her
own
chamber
and
cried
.
 
<EOS>
The
Doctor
was
a
pleasant
sight
too
,
looking
on
at
them
,
and
telling
Miss
Pross
how
she
spoilt
Lucie
,
in
accents
and
with
eyes
that
had
as
much
spoiling
in
them
as
Miss
Pross
had
,
and
would
have
had
more
if
it
were
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
was
a
pleasant
sight
too
,
beaming
at
all
this
in
his
little
wig
,
and
thanking
his
bachelor
stars
for
having
lighted
him
in
his
declining
years
to
a
Home
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
no
Hundreds
of
people
came
to
see
the
sights
,
and
Mr
Lorry
looked
in
vain
for
the
fulfilment
of
Miss
Pross
's
prediction
.
   
<EOS>
Dinner
-
time
,
and
still
no
Hundreds
of
people
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
arrangements
of
the
little
household
,
Miss
Pross
took
charge
of
the
lower
regions
,
and
always
acquitted
herself
marvellously
.
 
<EOS>
Her
dinners
,
of
a
very
modest
quality
,
were
so
well
cooked
and
<EOS>
so
well
served
,
and
so
neat
in
their
contrivances
,
half
English
and
half
French
,
that
nothing
could
be
better
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pross
's
friendship
being
of
the
thoroughly
practical
kind
,
she
had
ravaged
Soho
and
the
adjacent
provinces
,
in
search
of
impoverished
French
,
who
,
tempted
by
shillings
and
half
-
crowns
,
would
impart
culinary
mysteries
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
From
these
decayed
sons
and
daughters
of
Gaul
,
she
had
acquired
such
wonderful
arts
,
that
the
woman
and
girl
who
formed
the
staff
of
domestics
regarded
her
as
quite
a
Sorceress
,
or
Cinderella
's
Godmother
:
 
who
would
send
out
for
a
fowl
,
a
rabbit
,
a
vegetable
or
two
from
the
garden
,
and
change
them
into
anything
she
pleased
.
   
<EOS>
On
Sundays
,
Miss
Pross
dined
at
the
Doctor
's
table
,
but
on
other
days
persisted
in
taking
her
meals
at
unknown
periods
,
either
in
the
lower
regions
,
or
in
her
own
room
on
the
second
floor
---
a
blue
chamber
,
to
which
no
one
but
her
Ladybird
ever
gained
admittance
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
,
Miss
Pross
,
responding
to
Ladybird
's
pleasant
face
and
pleasant
efforts
to
please
her
,
unbent
exceedingly
;
so
the
dinner
was
very
pleasant
,
too
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
an
oppressive
day
,
and
,
after
dinner
,
Lucie
proposed
that
the
wine
should
be
carried
out
under
the
plane
-
tree
,
and
they
should
sit
there
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
As
everything
turned
upon
her
,
and
revolved
about
her
,
they
went
out
under
the
plane
-
tree
,
and
she
carried
the
wine
down
for
the
special
benefit
of
Mr
Lorry
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
installed
herself
,
some
time
before
,
as
Mr
Lorry
's
cup
-
bearer
;
and
while
they
sat
under
the
plane
-
tree
,
talking
,
she
kept
his
glass
replenished
.
 
<EOS>
Mysterious
backs
and
ends
of
houses
peeped
at
them
as
they
talked
,
and
the
plane
-
tree
whispered
to
them
in
its
own
way
above
their
heads
.
   
<EOS>
Still
,
the
Hundreds
of
people
did
not
present
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Darnay
presented
himself
while
they
were
sitting
under
the
plane
-
tree
,
but
he
was
only
One
.
   
<EOS>
Doctor
Manette
received
him
kindly
,
and
so
did
Lucie
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Miss
Pross
suddenly
became
afflicted
with
a
twitching
in
the
head
and
body
,
and
retired
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
not
unfrequently
the
victim
of
this
disorder
,
and
she
called
it
,
in
familiar
conversation
,
"
a
fit
of
the
jerks
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
was
in
his
best
condition
,
and
looked
specially
young
.
<EOS>
The
resemblance
between
him
and
Lucie
was
very
strong
at
such
times
,
and
as
they
sat
side
by
side
,
she
leaning
on
his
shoulder
,
and
he
resting
his
arm
on
the
back
of
her
chair
,
it
was
very
agreeable
to
trace
the
likeness
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
been
talking
all
day
,
on
many
subjects
,
and
with
unusual
vivacity
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
Doctor
Manette
,
"
said
Mr
Darnay
,
as
they
sat
under
the
plane
-
tree
---
and
he
said
it
in
the
natural
pursuit
of
the
topic
in
hand
,
which
happened
to
be
the
old
buildings
of
London
---
"
have
you
seen
much
of
the
Tower
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lucie
and
I
have
been
there
;
but
only
casually
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
seen
enough
of
it
,
to
know
that
it
teems
with
interest
;
little
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
\I\
have
been
there
,
as
you
remember
,
"
said
Darnay
,
with
a
smile
,
though
reddening
a
little
angrily
,
"
in
another
character
,
and
not
in
a
character
that
gives
facilities
for
seeing
much
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
told
me
a
curious
thing
when
I
was
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
was
that
?
"
<EOS>
Lucie
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
making
some
alterations
,
the
workmen
came
upon
an
old
dungeon
,
which
had
been
,
for
many
years
,
built
up
and
forgotten
.
 
<EOS>
Every
stone
of
its
inner
wall
was
covered
by
inscriptions
which
had
been
carved
by
prisoners
---
dates

Upon
a
corner
stone
in
an
angle
of
the
wall
,
one
prisoner
,
who
seemed
to
have
gone
to
execution
,
had
cut
as
his
last
work
,
three
letters
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
done
with
some
very
poor
instrument
,
and
hurriedly
,
with
an
unsteady
hand
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
they
were
read
as
D^
I^
C^
;
but
,
on
being
more
carefully
examined
,
the
last
letter
was
found
to
be
G.
<EOS>
There
was
no
record
or
legend
of
any
prisoner
with
those
initials
,
and
many
fruitless
guesses
were
made
what
the
name
could
have
been
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
it
was
suggested
that
the
letters
were
not
initials
,
but
the
complete
word
,
DiG.
 
<EOS>
The
floor
was
examined
very
carefully
under
the
inscription
,
and
,
in
the
earth
beneath
a
stone
,
or
tile
,
or
some
fragment
of
paving
,
were
found
the
ashes
of
a
paper
,
mingled
with
the
ashes
of
a
small
leathern
case
or
bag
.
 
<EOS>
What
the
unknown
prisoner
had
written
will
never
be
read
,
but
he
had
written
something
,
and
hidden
it
away
to
keep
it
from
the
gaoler
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
father
,
"
exclaimed
Lucie
,
"
you
are
ill
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
suddenly
started
up
,
with
his
hand
to
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
His
manner
and
his
look
quite
terrified
them
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
my
dear
,
not
ill
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
large
drops
of
rain
falling
,
and
they
made
me
start
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
better
go
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
recovered
himself
almost
instantly
.
 
<EOS>
Rain
was
really
falling
in
large
drops
,
and
he
showed
the
back
of
his
hand
with
rain
-
drops
on
it
.
<EOS>
But
,
he
said
not
a
single
word
in
reference
to
the
discovery
that
had
been
told
of
,
<EOS>
and
,
as
they
went
into
the
house
,
the
business
eye
of
Mr
Lorry
either
detected
,
or
fancied
it
detected
,
on
his
face
,
as
it
turned
towards
Charles
Darnay
,
the
same
singular
look
that
had
been
upon
it
when
it
turned
towards
him
in
the
passages
of
the
Court
House
.
   
<EOS>
He
recovered
himself
so
quickly
,
however
,
that
Mr
Lorry
had
doubts
of
his
business
eye
.
 
<EOS>
The
arm
of
the
golden
giant
in
the
hall
was
not
more
steady
than
he
was
,
when
he
stopped
under
it
to
remark
to
them
that
he
was
not
yet
proof
against
slight
surprises
(
if
he
ever
would
be
)
,
and
that
the
rain
had
startled
him
.
   
<EOS>
Tea
-
time
,
and
Miss
Pross
making
tea
,
with
another
fit
of
the
jerks
upon
her
,
and
yet
no
Hundreds
of
people
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Carton
had
lounged
in
,
but
he
made
only
Two
.
   
<EOS>
The
night
was
so
very
sultry
,
that
although
they
sat
with
doors
and
windows
open
,
they
were
overpowered
by
heat
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
tea
-
table
was
done
with
,
they
all
moved
to
one
of
the
windows
,
and
looked
out
into
the
heavy
twilight
.
 
<EOS>
Lucie
sat
by
her
father
;
Darnay
sat
beside
her
;
Carton
leaned
against
a
window
.
 
<EOS>
The
curtains
were
long
and
white
,
and
some
of
the
thunder
-
gusts
that
whirled
into
the
corner
,
caught
them
up
to
the
ceiling
,
and
waved
them
like
spectral
wings
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
rain
-
drops
are
still
falling
,
large
,
heavy
,
and
few
,
"
said
Doctor
Manette
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
comes
slowly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
comes
surely
,
"
said
Carton
.
   
<EOS>
They
spoke
low
,
as
people
watching
and
waiting
mostly
do
;
as
people
in
a
dark
room
,
watching
and
waiting
for
Lightning
,
always
do
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
hurry
in
the
streets
of
people
speeding
away
to
get
shelter
before
the
storm
broke
;
the
wonderful
corner
for
echoes
resounded
with
the
echoes
of
footsteps
coming
and
going
,
yet
not
a
footstep
was
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
multitude
of
people
,
and
yet
a
solitude
!
<EOS>
"
said
Darnay
,
when
they
had
listened
for
a
while
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
impressive
,
Mr
Darnay
?
"
asked
Lucie
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sometimes
,
I
have
sat
here
of
an
evening
,
until
I
have
fancied
---
but
even
the
shade
of
a
foolish
fancy
makes
me
shudder
to
-
night
,
when
all
is
so
black
and
solemn
<EOS>

"
   
"
Let
us
shudder
too

<EOS>
We
may
know
what
it
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
will
seem
nothing
to
you

<EOS>
Such
whims
are
only
impressive
as
we
originate
them
,
I
think
;
they
are
not
to
be
communicated
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
sometimes
sat
alone
here
of
an
evening
,
listening
,
until
I
have
made
the
echoes
out
to
be
the
echoes
of
all
the
footsteps
that
are
coming
by
-
and
-
bye
into
our
lives
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
great
crowd
coming
one
day
into
our
lives
,
if
that
be
so
,
"
Sydney
Carton
struck
in
,
in
his
moody
way
.
   
<EOS>
The
footsteps
were
incessant
,
and
the
hurry
of
them
became
more
and
more
rapid
.
 
<EOS>
The
corner
echoed
and
re
-
echoed
with
the
tread
of
feet
;
some
,
as
it
seemed
,
under
the
windows
;
some
,
as
it
seemed
,
in
the
room
;
some
coming
,
some
going
,
some
breaking
off
,
some
stopping
altogether
;
all
in
the
distant
streets
,
and
not
one
within
sight
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
all
these
footsteps
destined
to
come
to
all
of
us
,
Miss
Manette
,
or
are
we
to
divide
them
among
us
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
<EOS>
Mr
Darnay
;
I
told
you
it
was
a
foolish
fancy
,
but
you
asked
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
have
yielded
myself
to
it
,
I
have
been
alone
,
and
then
I
have
imagined
them
the
footsteps
of
the
people
who
are
to
come
into
my
life
,
and
my
father
's
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
take
them
into
mine
!
"
said
Carton
.
 
<EOS>
"
\I\
ask
no
questions
and
make
no
stipulations

<EOS>
There
is
a
great
crowd
bearing
down
upon
us
,
Miss
Manette
,
and
I
see
them
---
by
the
Lightning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
added
the
last
words
,
after
there
had
been
a
vivid
flash
which
had
shown
him
lounging
in
the
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
hear
them
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
again
,
after
a
peal
of
thunder
.
<EOS>
"
Here
they
come
,
fast
,
fierce
,
and
furious
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
rush
and
roar
of
rain
that
he
typified
,
and
it
stopped
him
,
for
no
voice
could
be
heard
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
memorable
storm
of
thunder
and
lightning
broke
with
that
sweep
of
water
,
and
there
was
not
a
moment
's
interval
in
crash
,
and
fire
,
and
rain
,
until
after
the
moon
rose
at
midnight
.
   
<EOS>
The
great
bell
of
Saint
Paul
's
was
striking
one
in
the
cleared
air
,
when
Mr
Lorry
,
escorted
by
Jerry
,
high
-
booted
and
bearing
a
lantern
,
set
forth
on
his
return
-
passage
to
Clerkenwell
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
solitary
patches
of
road
on
the
way
between
Soho
and
Clerkenwell
,
and
Mr
Lorry
,
mindful
of
foot

pads

always
retained
Jerry
for
this
service
:
 
though
it
was
usually
performed
a
good
two
hours
earlier

<EOS>
"
What

Almost

Chapter
7
.
<EOS>
Monseigneur
in
Town
 
Monseigneur
,
one
of
the
great
lords
in
power
at
the
Court
,
held
his
fortnightly
reception
in
his
grand
hotel
in
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
Monseigneur
was
in
his
inner
room
,
his
sanctuary
of
sanctuaries
,
the
Holiest
of
Holiests
to
the
crowd
of
worshippers
in
the
suite
of
rooms
without
.
<EOS>
Monseigneur
was
about
to
take
his
chocolate
.
 
<EOS>
Monseigneur
could
swallow
a
great
many
things
with
ease
,
and
was
by
some
few
sullen
minds
supposed
to
be
rather
rapidly
swallowing
France
;
but
,
his
morning
's
chocolate
could
not
so
much
as
get
into
the
throat
of
Monseigneur
,
without
the
aid
of
four
strong
men
besides
the
Cook
.
   
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
It
took
four
men
,
all
four
ablaze
with
gorgeous
decoration
,
and
the
Chief
of
them
unable
to
exist
with
fewer
than
two
gold
watches
in
his
pocket
,
<EOS>
emulative
of
the
noble
and
chaste
fashion
set
by
Monseigneur
,
to
conduct
the
happy
chocolate
to
Monseigneur
's
lips
.
<EOS>
One
lacquey
carried
the
chocolate
-
pot
into
the
sacred
presence
;
a
second
,
milled
and
frothed
the
chocolate
with
the
little
instrument
he
bore
for
that
function
;
a
third
,
presented
the
favoured
napkin
;
a
fourth
(
he
of
the
two
gold
watches
)
,
poured
the
chocolate
out
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
for
Monseigneur
to
dispense
with
one
of
these
attendants
on
the
chocolate
and
hold
his
high
place
under
the
admiring
Heavens
.
 
<EOS>
Deep
would
have
been
the
blot
upon
his
escutcheon
if
his
chocolate
had
been
ignobly
waited
on
by
only
three
men
;
he
must
have
died
of
two
.
   
<EOS>
Monseigneur
had
been
out
at
a
little
supper
last
night
,
where
the
Comedy
and
the
Grand
Opera
were
charmingly
represented
.
 
<EOS>
Monseigneur
was
out
at
a
little
supper
most
nights
,
with
fascinating
company
.
<EOS>
So
polite
and
so
impressible
was
Monseigneur
,
that
the
Comedy
and
the
Grand
Opera
had
far
more
influence
with
him
in
the
tiresome
articles
of
state
affairs
and
state
secrets
,
than
the
needs
of
all
France
.
 
<EOS>
A
happy
circumstance
for
France
,
as
the
like
always
is
for
all
countries
similarly
favoured
!
<EOS>
---
always
was
for
England
(
by
way
of
example
)
,
in
the
regretted
days
of
the
merry
Stuart
who
sold
it
.
   
<EOS>
Monseigneur
had
one
truly
noble
idea
of
general
public
business
,
which
was
,
to
let
everything
go
on
in
its
own
way
;
of
particular
public
business
,
Monseigneur
had
the
other
truly
noble
idea
that
it
must
all
go
his
way
---
tend
to
his
own
power
and
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
Of
his
pleasures
,
general
and
particular
,
Monseigneur
had
the
other
truly
noble
idea
,
that
the
world
was
made
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
text
of
his
order
(
altered
from
the
original
by
only
a
pronoun
,
which
is
not
much
)
ran
:
"
<EOS>
The
earth
and
the
fulness
thereof
are
mine
,
saith
Monseigneur
.
"
   
<EOS>
Yet
,
Monseigneur
had
slowly
found
that
vulgar
embarrassments
crept
into
his
affairs
,
both
private
and
public
;
and
he
had
,
as
to
both
classes
of
affairs
,
allied
himself
perforce
with
a
Farmer
-
General
.
<EOS>
As
to
finances
public
,
because
Monseigneur
could
not
make
anything
at
all
of
them
,
and
must
consequently
let
them
out
to
somebody
who
could
;
as
to
finances
private
,
because
Farmer
-
Generals
were
rich
,
and
Monseigneur
,
after
generations
of
great
luxury
and
expense
,
was
growing
poor
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
Monseigneur
had
taken
his
sister
from
a
convent
,
while
there
was
yet
time
to
ward
off
the
impending
veil
,
the
cheapest
garment
she
could
wear
,
and
had
bestowed
her
as
a
prize
upon
a
very
rich
Farmer
-
General
,
poor
in
family
.
 
<EOS>
Which
Farmer
-
General
,
carrying
an
appropriate
cane
with
a
golden
apple
on
the
top
of
it
,
was
now
among
the
company
in
the
outer
rooms
,
much
prostrated
before
by
mankind
---
always
excepting
superior
mankind
of
the
blood
of
Monseigneur
,
who
,
his
own
wife
included
,
looked
down
upon
him
with
the
loftiest
contempt
.
   
<EOS>
A
sumptuous
man
was
the
Farmer
-
General
.
 
<EOS>
Thirty
horses
stood
in
his
stables
,
twenty
-
four
male
domestics
sat
in
his
halls
,
six
body
-
women
waited
on
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
As
one
who
pretended
to
do
nothing
but
plunder
and
forage
where
he
could
,
the
Farmer
-
General
---
howsoever
his
matrimonial
relations
conduced
to
social
morality
---
was
at
least
the
greatest
reality
among
the
personages
who
attended
at
the
hotel
of
Monseigneur
that
day
.
   
<EOS>
For

the

though
a
beautiful

look
at
,
and
adorned
with
every
device
of
decoration
that
the
taste

skill

the

achieve

were
,
in

not

almost
equidistant

Projectors

had
discovered
every
kind
of
remedy
for
the
little
evils
with
which
the
State
was
touched
,
except
the

of
setting

root
out

poured
their
distracting
babble

Unbelieving

Exquisite
gentlemen
of
the
finest
breeding
,
which
was
at
that
remarkable
time
---
and
has
been
since

to
be
known
by
its
fruits
of
indifference
to

of
human
interest
,
were
in
the
most
exemplary
state
of
exhaustion
,
at
the
hotel
of
Monseigneur
.
 
<EOS>
Such
homes
had
these
various
notabilities
left
behind
them
in
the
fine
world
of
Paris
,
that
the
spies
among
the
assembled
devotees
of
Monseigneur
---
forming
a
goodly
half
of
the
polite
company
---
would
have
found
it
hard
to
discover
among
the
angels
of
that
sphere
one
solitary
wife
,
who
,
in
her
manners
and
appearance
,
owned
to
being
a
Mother
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
except
for
the
mere
act
of
bringing
a
troublesome
creature
into
this
world
---
which
does
not
go
far
towards
the
realisation
of
the
name
of
mother
---
there
was
no
such
thing
known
to
the
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
Peasant
women
kept
the
unfashionable
babies
close
,
and
brought
them
up
,
and
charming
grandmammas
of
sixty
dressed
and
supped
as
at
twenty
.
   
<EOS>
The
leprosy
of
unreality
disfigured
every
human
creature
in
attendance
upon
Monseigneur
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
outermost
room
were
half
a
dozen
exceptional
people
who
had
had
,
for
a
few
years
,
some
vague
misgiving
in
them
that
things
in
general
were
going
rather
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
promising
way
of
setting
them
right
,
half
of
the
half
-
dozen
had
become
members
of
a
fantastic
sect
of
Convulsionists
,
and
were
even
then
considering
within
themselves
whether
they
should
foam
,
rage
,
roar
,
and
turn
cataleptic
on
the
spot
---
thereby
setting
up
a
highly
intelligible
finger
-
post
to
the
Future
,
for
Monseigneur
's
guidance
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
these
Dervishes
,
were
other
three
who
had
rushed
into
another
sect
,
which
mended
matters
with
a
jargon
about
"
the
Centre
of
Truth
:
"
holding
that
Man
had
got
out
of
the
Centre
of
Truth
---
which
did
not
need
much
demonstration
---
but
had
not
got
out
of
the
Circumference
,
and
that
he
was
to
be
kept
from
flying
out
of
the
Circumference
,
and
was
even
to
be
shoved
back
into
the
Centre
,
by
fasting
and
seeing
of
spirits
.
<EOS>
Among
these
,
accordingly
,
much
discoursing
with
spirits
went
on
---
and
it
did
a
world
of
good
which
never
became
manifest
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
the
comfort
was
,
that
all
the
company
at
the
grand
hotel
of
Monseigneur
were
perfectly
dressed
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
Day
of
Judgment
had
only
been
ascertained
to
be
a
dress
day
,
everybody
there
would
have
been
eternally
correct
.
 
<EOS>
Such
frizzling
and
powdering
and
sticking
up
of
hair
,
such
delicate
complexions
artificially
preserved
and
mended
,
such
gallant
swords
to
look
at
,
and
such
delicate
honour
to
the
sense
of
smell
,
would
surely
keep
anything
going
,
for
ever
and
ever
.
<EOS>
The
exquisite
gentlemen
of
the
finest
breeding
wore
little
pendent
trinkets
that
chinked
as
they
languidly
moved
;
these
golden
fetters
rang
like
precious
little
bells
;
and
what
with
that
ringing
,
and
with
the
rustle
of
silk
and
brocade
and
fine
linen
,
there
was
a
flutter
in
the
air
that
fanned
Saint
Antoine
and
his
devouring
hunger
far
away
.
   
<EOS>
Dress
was
the
one
unfailing
talisman
and
charm
used
for
keeping
all
things
in
their
places
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
was
dressed
for
a
Fancy
Ball
that
was
never
to
leave
off
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
Palace
of
the
Tuileries
,
through
Monseigneur
and
the
whole
Court
,
through
the
Chambers
,
the
Tribunals
of
Justice
,
and
all
society
(
except
the
scarecrows
)
,
the
Fancy
Ball
descended
to
the
Common
Executioner
:
 
who
,
in
pursuance
of
the
charm
,
was
required
to
officiate
"
frizzled
,
powdered
,
in
a
gold
-
laced
coat
,
pumps
,
and
white
silk
stockings
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
the
gallows
and
the
wheel
---
the
axe
was
a
rarity
---
Monsieur
Paris
,
as
it
was
the
episcopal
mode
among
his
brother
Professors
of
the
provinces
,
Monsieur
Orleans
,
and
the
rest
,
to
call
him
,
presided
in
this
dainty
dress
.
 
<EOS>
And
who
among
the
company
at
Monseigneur
's
reception
in
that
seventeen
hundred
and
eightieth
year
of
our
Lord
,
could
possibly
doubt
,
that
a
system
rooted
in
a
frizzled
hangman
,
powdered
,
gold
-
laced
,
pumped
,
and
white
-
silk
stockinged
,
would
see
the
very
stars
out
!
   
<EOS>
Monseigneur
having
eased
his
four
men
of
their
burdens
and
taken
his
chocolate
,
caused
the
doors
of
the
Holiest
of
Holiests
to
be
thrown
open
,
and
issued
forth
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
what
submission
,
what
cringing
and
fawning
,
what
servility
,
what
abject
humiliation
!
 
<EOS>
As
to
bowing
down
in
body
and
spirit
,
nothing
in
that
way
was
left
for
Heaven
---
which
may
have
been
one
among
other
reasons
why
the
worshippers
of
Monseigneur
never
troubled
it
.
   
<EOS>
Bestowing
a
word
of
promise
here
and
a
smile
there
,
a
whisper
on
one
happy
slave
and
a
wave
of
the
hand
on
another
,
Monseigneur
affably
passed
through
his
rooms
to
the
remote
region
of
the
Circumference
of
Truth
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
Monseigneur
turned
,
and
came
back
again
,
and
so
in
due
course
of
time
got
himself
shut
up
in
his
sanctuary
by
the
chocolate
sprites
,
and
was
seen
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
The
show
being
over
,
the
flutter
in
the
air
became
quite
a
little
storm
,
and
the
precious
little
bells
went
ringing
downstairs
.
<EOS>
There
was
soon
but
one
person
left
of
all
the
crowd
,
and
he
,
with
his
hat
under
his
arm
and
his
snuff
-
box
in
his
hand
,
slowly
passed
among
the
mirrors
on
his
way
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
devote
you
,
"
said
this
person
,
stopping
at
the
last
door
on
his
way
,
and
turning
in
the
direction
of
the
sanctuary
,
"
to
the
Devil
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
shook
the
snuff
from
his
fingers
as
if
he
had
shaken
the
dust
from
his
feet
,
and
quietly
walked
downstairs
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
of
about
sixty
,
handsomely
dressed
,
haughty
in
manner
,
and
with
a
face
like
a
fine
mask
.
 
<EOS>
A
face
of
a
transparent
paleness
;
every
feature
in
it
clearly
defined
;
one
set
expression
on
it
.
<EOS>
The
nose
,
beautifully
formed
otherwise
,
was
very
slightly
pinched
at
the
top
of
each
nostril
.
 
<EOS>
In
those
two
compressions
,
or
dints
,
the
only
little
change
that
the
face
ever
showed
,
resided
.
 
<EOS>
They
persisted
in
changing
colour
sometimes
,
and
they
would
be
occasionally
dilated
and
contracted
by
something
like
a
faint
pulsation
;
then
,
they
gave
a
look
of
treachery
,
and
cruelty
,
to
the
whole
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
Examined
with
attention
,
its
capacity
of
helping
such
a
look
was
to
be
found
in
the
line
of
the
mouth
,
and
the
lines
of
the
orbits
of
the
eyes
,
being
much
too
horizontal
and
thin
;
still
,
in
the
effect
of
the
face
made
,
it
was
a
handsome
face
,
and
a
remarkable
one
.
   
<EOS>
Its
owner
went
downstairs
into
the
courtyard
,
got
into
his
carriage
,
and
drove
away
.
 
<EOS>
Not
many
people
had
talked
with
him
at
the
reception
;
he
had
stood
in
a
little
space
apart
,
and
Monseigneur
might
have
been
warmer
in
his
manner
.
 
<EOS>
It
appeared
,
under
the
circumstances
,
rather
agreeable
to
him
to
see
the
common
people
dispersed
before
his
horses
,
and
often
barely
escaping
from
being
run
down
.
 
<EOS>
His
man
drove
as
if
he
were
charging
an
enemy
,
and
the
furious
recklessness
of
the
man
brought
no
check
into
the
face
,
or
to
the
lips
,
of
the
master
.
 
<EOS>
The
complaint
had
sometimes
made
itself
audible
,
even
in
that
deaf
city
and
dumb
age
,
that
,
in
the
narrow
streets
without
footways
,
the
fierce
patrician
custom
of
hard
driving
endangered
and
maimed
the
mere
vulgar
in
a
barbarous
manner
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
few
cared
enough
for
that
to
think
of
it
a
second
time
,
and
,
in
this
matter
,
as
in
all
others
,
the
common
wretches
were
left
to
get
out
of
their
difficulties
as
they
could
.
   
<EOS>
With
a
wild
rattle
and
clatter
,
and
an
inhuman
abandonment
of
consideration
not
easy
to
be
understood
in
these
days
,
the
carriage
dashed
through
streets
and
swept
round
corners
,
with
women
screaming
before
it
,
and
men
clutching
each
other
and
clutching
children
out
of
its
way
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
swooping
at
a
street
corner
by
a
fountain
,
one
of
its
wheels
came
to
a
sickening
little
jolt
,
and
there
was
a
loud
cry
from
a
number
of
voices
,
and
the
horses
reared
and
plunged
.
   
<EOS>
But
for
the
latter
inconvenience
,
the
carriage
probably
would
not
have
stopped
;
carriages
were
often
known
to
drive
on
,
and
leave
their
wounded
behind
,
and
why
not
?
 
<EOS>
But
the
frightened
valet
had
got
down
in
a
hurry
,
and
there
were
twenty
hands
at
the
horses
'
bridles
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
has
gone
wrong
?
"
said
Monsieur
,
calmly
looking
out
.
   
<EOS>
A
tall
man
in
a
nightcap
had
caught
up
a
bundle
from
among
the
feet
of
the
horses
,
and
had
laid
it
on
the
basement
of
the
fountain
,
and
was
down
in
the
mud
and
wet
,
howling
over
it
like
a
wild
animal
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pardon
,
Monsieur
the
Marquis
!
"
said
a
ragged
and
submissive
man
,
"
it
is
a
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
does
he
make
that
abominable
noise
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
his
child
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
Monsieur
the
Marquis
---
it
is
a
pity
---
yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
fountain
was
a
little
removed
;
for
the
street
opened
,
where
it
was
,
into
a
space
some
ten
or
twelve
yards
square
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
tall
man
suddenly
got
up
from
the
ground
,
and
came
running
at
the
carriage
,
Monsieur
the
Marquis
clapped
his
hand
for
an
instant
on
his
sword
-
hilt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Killed
!
"
<EOS>
shrieked
the
man
,
in
wild
desperation
,
extending
both
arms
at
their
length
above
his
head
,
and
staring
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dead
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
people
closed
round
,
and
looked
at
Monsieur
the
Marquis
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
revealed
by
the
many
eyes
that
looked
at
him
but
watchfulness
and
eagerness
;
there
was
no
visible
menacing
or
anger
.
<EOS>
Neither
did
the
people
say
anything
;
after
the
first
cry
,
they
had
been
silent
,
and
they
remained
so
.
 
<EOS>
The
voice
of
the
submissive
man
who
had
spoken
,
was
flat
and
tame
in
its
extreme
submission
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
the
Marquis
ran
his
eyes
over
them
all
,
as
if
they
had
been
mere
rats
come
out
of
their
holes
.
   
<EOS>
He
took
out
his
purse
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
extraordinary
to
me
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
you
people
can
not
take
care
of
yourselves
and
your
children
.
 
<EOS>
One
or
the
other
of
you
is
for
ever
in
the
,
way
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
I
know
what
injury
you
have
done
my
horses
.
<EOS>
See
!
 
<EOS>
Give
him
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
threw
out
a
gold
coin
for
the
valet
to
pick
up
,
and
all
the
heads
craned
forward
that
all
the
eyes
might
look
down
at
it
as
it
fell
.
<EOS>
The
tall
man
called
out
again
with
a
most
unearthly
cry
,
"
Dead
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
arrested
by
the
quick
arrival
of
another
man
,
for
whom
the
rest
made
way
.
 
<EOS>
On
seeing
him
,
the
miserable
creature
fell
upon
his
shoulder
,
sobbing
and
crying
,
and
pointing
to
the
fountain
,
where
some
women
were
stooping
over
the
motionless
bundle
,
and
moving
gently
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
as
silent
,
however
,
as
the
men
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
all
,
I
know
all
,
"
said
the
last
comer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
a
brave
man
,
my
Gaspard
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
better
for
the
poor
little
plaything
to
die
so
,
than
to
live
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
died
in
a
moment
without
pain
.
 
<EOS>
Could
it
have
lived
an
hour
as
happily
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
philosopher
,
you
there
,
"
said
the
,
Marquis
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
How
do
they
call
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
call
me
Defarge
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
what
trade
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
the
Marquis
,
vendor
of
wine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pick
up
that
,
philosopher
and
vendor
of
wine
,
"
said
the
Marquis
,
throwing
him
another
gold
coin
,
"
and
spend
it
as
you
will
.
<EOS>
The
horses
there
;
are
they
right
?
"
   
<EOS>
Without
deigning
to
look
at
the
assemblage
a
second
time
,
Monsieur
the
Marquis
leaned
back
in
his
seat
,
and
was
just
being
driven
away
with
the
air
of
a
gentleman
who
had
accidentally
broke
some
common
thing
,
and
had
paid
for
it
,
and
could
afford
to
pay
for
it
;
when
his
ease
was
suddenly
disturbed
by
a
coin
flying
into
his
carriage
,
and
ringing
on
its
floor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
"
said
Monsieur
the
Marquis
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
the
horses
!
 
<EOS>
Who
threw
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
looked
to
the
spot
where
Defarge
the
vendor
of
wine
had
stood
,
a
moment
before
;
but
the
wretched
father
was
grovelling
on
his
face
on
the
pavement
in
that
spot
,
and
the
figure
that
stood
beside
him
was
the
figure
of
a
dark
stout
woman
,
knitting

"
You
dogs
!
"
said
the
Marquis
,
but
smoothly
,
and
with
an
unchanged
front
,
except
as
to
the
spots
on
his
nose
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
ride
over
any
of
you
very
willingly
,
and
exterminate
you
from
the
earth
.
<EOS>
If
I
knew
which
rascal
threw
at
the
carriage
,
and
if
that
brigand
were
sufficiently
near
it
,
he
should
be
crushed
under
the
wheels
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
cowed
was
their
condition
,
and
so
long
and
hard
their
experience
of
what
such
a
man
could
do
to
them
,
within
the
law
and
beyond
it
,
that
not
a
voice
,
or
a
hand
,
or
even
an
eye
was
raised
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
men
,
not
one
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
woman
who
stood
knitting
looked
up
steadily
,
and
looked
the
Marquis
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
for
his
dignity
to
notice
it
;
his
contemptuous
eyes
passed
over
her
,
and
over
all
the
other
rats
;
and
he
leaned
back
in
his
seat
again
,
and
gave
the
word
"
Go
on
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
driven
on
,
and
other
carriages
came
whirling
by
in
quick
succession
;
the
Minister
,
the
State
-
Projector
,
the
Farmer
-
General
,
the
Doctor
,
the
Lawyer
,
the
Ecclesiastic
,
the
Grand
Opera
,
the
Comedy
,
the
whole
Fancy
Ball
in
a
bright
continuous
flow
,
came
whirling
by
.
 
<EOS>
The
rats
had
crept
out
of
their
holes
to
look
on
,
and
they
remained
looking
on
for
hours
;
soldiers
and
police
often
passing
between
them
and
the
spectacle
,
and
making
a
barrier
behind
which
they
slunk
,
and
through
which
they
peeped
.
 
<EOS>
The
father
had
long
ago
taken
up
his
bundle
and
bidden
himself
away
with
it
,
when
the
women
who
had
tended
the
bundle
while
it
lay
on
the
base
of
the
fountain
,
sat
there
watching
the
running
of
the
water
and
the
rolling
of
the
Fancy
Ball
---
when
the
one
woman
who
had
stood
conspicuous
,
knitting
,
still
knitted
on
with
the
steadfastness
of
Fate
.
 
<EOS>
The
water
of
the
fountain
ran
,
the
swift
river
ran
,
the
day
ran
into
evening
,
so
much
life
in
the
city
ran
into
death
according
to
rule
,
time
and
tide
waited
for
no
man
,
the
rats
were
sleeping
close
together
in
their
dark
holes
again
,
the
Fancy
Ball
was
lighted
up
at
supper
,
all
things
ran
their
course
.

Monseigneur
in
the
Country
 
<EOS>
A
beautiful
landscape
,
with
the
corn
bright
in
it
,
but
not
abundant
.
<EOS>
Patches
of
poor
rye
where
com
should
have
been
,
patches
of
poor
peas
and
beans
,
patches
of
most
coarse
vegetable
substitutes
for
wheat
.
<EOS>
On
inanimate
nature
,
as
on
the
men
and
women
who
cultivated
it
,
a
prevalent
tendency
towards
an
appearance
of
vegetating
unwillingly
---
a
dejected
disposition
to
give
up
,
and
wither
away
.
   
<EOS>
Monsieur
the
Marquis
in
his
travelling
carriage
(
which
might
have
been
lighter
)
,
conducted
by
four
post
-
horses
and
two
postilions
,
fagged
up
a
steep
hill
.
 
<EOS>
A
blush
on
the
countenance
of
Monsieur
the
Marquis
was
no
impeachment
of
his
high
breeding
;
it
was
not
from
within
;
it
was
occasioned
by
an
external
circumstance
beyond
his
control
---
the
setting
sun
.
   
<EOS>
The
sunset
struck
so
brilliantly
into
the
travelling
carriage
when
it
gained
the
hill
-
top
,
that
its
occupant
was
steeped
in
crimson
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
die
out
,
"
said
Monsieur
the
Marquis
,
glancing
at
his
hands
,
"
directly
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
effect
,
the
sun
was
so
low
that
it
dipped
at
the
moment
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
heavy
drag
had
been
adjusted
to
the
wheel
,
and
the
carriage
slid
down
hill
,
with
a
cinderous
smell
,
in
a
cloud
of
dust
,
the
red
glow
departed
quickly
;
the
sun
and
the
Marquis
going
down
together
<EOS>
,
there
was
no
glow
left
when
the
drag
was
taken
off
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
there
remained
a
broken
country
,
bold
and
open
,
a
little
village
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
,
a
broad
sweep
and
rise
beyond
it
,
a
church
-
tower
,
a
windmill
,
a
forest
for
the
chase
,
and
a
crag
with
a
fortress
on
it
used
as
a
prison
.
 
<EOS>
Round
upon
all
these
darkening
objects
as
the
night
drew
on
,
the
Marquis
looked
,
with
the
air
of
one
who
was
coming
near
home
.
   
<EOS>
The
village
had
its
one
poor
street
,
with
its
poor
brewery
,
poor
tannery
,
poor
tavern
,
poor
stable
-
yard
for
relays
of
post
-
horses
,
poor
fountain
,
all
usual
poor
appointments
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
its
poor
people
too
.
 
<EOS>
All
its
people
were
poor
,
and
many
of
them
were
sitting
at
their
doors
,
shredding
spare
onions
and
the
like
for
supper
,
while
many
were
at
the
fountain
,
washing
leaves
,
and
grasses
,
and
any
such
small
yieldings
of
the
earth
that
could
be
eaten
.
 
<EOS>
Expressive
sips
of
what
made
them
poor
,
were
not
wanting
;
the
tax
for
the
state
,
the
tax
for
the
church
,
the
tax
for
the
lord
,
tax
local
and
tax
general
,
were
to
be
paid
here
and
to
be
paid
there
,
according
to
solemn
inscription
in
the
little
village
,
until
the
wonder
was
,
that
there
was
any
village
left
unswallowed
.
   
<EOS>
Few
children
were
to
be
seen
,
and
no
dogs
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
men
and
women
,
their
choice
on
earth
was
stated
in
the
prospect
---
Life
on
the
lowest
terms
that
could
sustain
it
,
down
in
the
little
village
under
the
mill
;
or
captivity
and
Death
in
the
dominant
prison
on
the
crag
.
   
<EOS>
Heralded
by
a
courier
in
advance
,
and
by
the
cracking
of
his
postilions
'
whips
,
which
twined
snake
-
like
about
their
heads
in
the
evening
air
,
as
if
he
came
attended
by
the
Furies
,
Monsieur
the
Marquis
drew
up
in
his
travelling
carriage
at
the
posting
-
house
gate
.
<EOS>
It
was
hard
by
the
fountain
,
and
the
peasants
suspended
their
operations
to
look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
them
,
and
saw
in
them
,
without
knowing
it
,
the
slow
sure
filing
down
of
misery
-
worn
face
and
figure
,
that
was
to
make
the
meagreness
of
Frenchmen
an
English
superstition
which
should
survive
the
truth
through
the
best
part
of
a
hundred
years
.
   
<EOS>
Monsieur
the
Marquis
cast
his
eyes
over
the
submissive
faces
that
drooped
before
him
,
as
the
like
of
himself
had
drooped
before
Monseigneur
of
the
Court
---
only
the
difference
was
,
that
these
faces
drooped
merely
to
suffer
and
not
to
propitiate
---
when
a
grizzled
mender
of
the
roads
joined
the
group
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bring
me
hither
that
fellow
!
"
said
the
Marquis
to
the
courier
.
   
<EOS>
The
fellow
was
brought
,
cap
in
hand
,
and
the
other
fellows
closed
round
to
look
and
listen
,
in
the
manner
of
the
people
at
the
Paris
fountain
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
passed
you
on
the
road
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Monseigneur
,
it
is
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
the
honour
of
being
passed
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Coming
up
the
hill
,
and
at
the
top
of
the
hill
,
both
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Monseigneur
,
it
is
true
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
look
at
,
so
fixedly
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Monseigneur
,
I
looked
at
the
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
stooped
a
little
,
and
with
his
tattered
blue
cap
pointed
under
the
carriage
.
 
<EOS>
All
his
fellows
stooped
to
look
under
the
carriage
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
man
,
pig
?
 
<EOS>
And
why
look
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pardon
,
Monseigneur
<EOS>
;
he
swung
by
the
chain
of
the
shoe
---
the
drag
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
demanded
the
traveller
.
   
<EOS>
"
Monseigneur
,
the
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
May
the
Devil
carry
away
these
idiots
!
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
can
the
man
?
<EOS>
You
know
all
the
men
of
this
part
of
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
Who
was
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
clemency
,
Monseigneur
!
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
of
this
part
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
Of
all
the
days
of
my
life
,
I
never
saw
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Swinging
by
the
chain
?
 
<EOS>
To
be
suffocated
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
With
your
gracious
permission
,
that
was
the
wonder
of
it
,
Monseigneur
.
 
<EOS>
His
head
hanging
over
---
like
this
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
turned
himself
sideways
to
the
carriage
,
and
leaned
back
,
with
his
face
thrown
up
to
the
sky
,
and
his
head
hanging
down
;
then
recovered
himself
,
fumbled
with
his
cap
,
and
made
a
bow
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
was
he
like
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Monseigneur
,
he
was
whiter
than
the
miller
.
 
<EOS>
All
covered
with
dust
,
white
as
a
spectre
,
tall
as
a
spectre
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
picture
produced
an
immense
sensation
in
the
little
crowd
;
but
all
eyes
,
without
comparing
notes
with
other
eyes
,
looked
at
Monsieur
the
Marquis
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
to
observe
whether
he
had
any
spectre
on
his
conscience
.
   
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
you
did
well
,
"
said
the
Marquis
,
felicitously
sensible
that
such
vermin
were
not
to
ruffle
him
,
"
to
see
a
thief
accompanying
my
carriage
,
and
not
open
that
great
mouth
of
yours
.
 
<EOS>
Bah
!
 
<EOS>
Put
him
aside
,
Monsieur
Gabelle
!
"
   
<EOS>
Monsieur
Gabelle
was
the
Postmaster
,
and
some
other
taxing
functionary
united
;
he
had
come
out
with
great
obsequiousness
to
assist
at
this
examination
,
and
had
held
the
examined
by
the
drapery
of
his
arm
in
an
official
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
 
<EOS>
Go
aside
!
"
said
Monsieur
Gabelle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lay
hands
on
this
stranger
if
he
seeks
to
lodge
in
your
village
to
-
night
,
and
be
sure
that
his
business
is
honest
,
Gabelle
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Monseigneur
,
I
am
flattered
to
devote
myself
to
your
orders
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
he
run
away
,
fellow
?
---
where
is
that
Accursed
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
accursed
was
already
under
the
carriage
with
some
half
-
dozen
particular
friends
,
pointing
out
the
chain
with
his
blue
cap
.
<EOS>
Some
half
-
dozen
other
particular
friends
promptly
hauled
him
out
,
and
presented
him
breathless
to
Monsieur
the
Marquis
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
the
man
run
away
,
Dolt
,
when
we
stopped
for
the
drag
?
"
   
"
Monseigneur
,
he
precipitated
himself
over
the
hill
-
side
,
head
first
,
as
a
person
plunges
into
the
river
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
See
to
it
,
Gabelle
.
 
<EOS>
Go
on
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
half
-
dozen
who
were
peering
at
the
chain
were
still
among
the
wheels
,
like
sheep
;
the
wheels
turned
so
suddenly
that
they
were
lucky
to
save
their
skins
and
bones
;
they
had
very
little
else
to
save
,
or
they
might
not
have
been
so
fortunate
.
   
<EOS>
The
burst
with
which
the
carriage
started
out
of
the
village
and
up
the
rise
beyond
,
was
soon
checked
by
the
steepness
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
Gradually
,
it
subsided
to
a
foot
pace
,
swinging
and
lumbering
upward
among
the
many
sweet
scents
of
a
summer
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
postilions
,
with
a
thousand
gossamer
gnats
circling
about
them
in
lieu
of
the
Furies
,
quietly
mended
the
points
to
the
lashes
of
their
whips
;
the
valet
walked
by
the
horses
;
the
courier
was
audible
,
trotting
on
ahead
into
the
dun
distance
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
steepest
point
of
the
hill
there
was
a
little
burial
-
ground
,
with
a
Cross
and
a
new
large
figure
of
Our
Saviour
on
it
;
it
was
a
poor
figure
in
wood
,
done
by
some
inexperienced
rustic
carver
,
but
he
had
studied
the
figure
from
the
life
---
his
own
life
,
maybe
---
<EOS>
for
it
was
dreadfully
spare
and
thin
.
   
<EOS>
To
this
distressful
emblem
of
a
great
distress
that
had
long
been
growing
worse
,
and
was
not
at
its
worst
,
a
woman
was
kneeling
.
<EOS>
She
turned
her
head
as
the
carriage
came
up
to
her
,
rose
quickly
,
and
presented
herself
at
the
carriage
-
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
you
,
Monseigneur
!
 
<EOS>
Monseigneur
,
a
petition

"
   
<EOS>
With
an
exclamation
of
impatience
,
but
with
his
unchangeable
face
,
Monseigneur
looked
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
,
then

<EOS>
What
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
Always
petitions

"
Monseigneur

For

My
husband

the
forester

"
   
<EOS>
"
What
of
your
husband
,
the
forester
?
 
<EOS>
Always
the
same
with
you
people
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
pay
something
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
paid
all

Monseigneur

<EOS>
He
is
dead

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well

<EOS>
He

quiet

<EOS>
Can
I
restore
him
to
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Alas

no

Monseigneur

But
he
lies
<EOS>
yonder
,
under
a
little
heap
of
poor
grass

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Well

<EOS>
"
Monseigneur

there

so
many
little
heaps
of
poor
grass

<EOS>
"
Again
,
well

"
   
<EOS>
She
looked
an
old
woman
,
but
was
young
.
 
<EOS>
Her
manner
was
one
of
passionate
grief
;
by
turns
she
clasped
her
veinous
and
knotted
hands
together
with
wild
energy
,
and
laid
one
of
them
on
the
carriage
-
door
 
---
tenderly
,
caressingly
,
as
if
it
had
been
a
human
breast
,
and
could
be
expected
to
feel
the
appealing
touch
.
   
<EOS>
"
Monseigneur
,
hear
me
!
 
<EOS>
Monseigneur

hear
my
petition

<EOS>
My
husband
died

want

so
many

Again
,

Monseigneur

I
do

ask
it

My
petition
is
,
that
a
morsel
of
stone

wood
,
with
my
husband

may
be
placed
over
him

show

it

never

shall
be
laid

The
valet
had
put
her
away
from
the
door
,
the
carriage
had
broken
into
a
brisk
trot
,
the
postilions
had
quickened
the
pace
,
she
was
left
far
behind
,
and
Monseigneur
,
again
escorted
by
the
Furies
,
was
rapidly
diminishing
the
league
or
two
of
distance
that
remained
between
him
and
his
chateau
.
   
<EOS>
The
sweet
scents
of
the
summer
night
rose
all
around
him
,
and
rose
,
as
the
rain
falls
,
impartially
,
on
the
dusty
,
ragged
,
and
toil
-
worn
group
at
the
fountain
not
far
away
;
to
whom
the
mender
of
roads
,
with
the
aid
of
the
blue
cap
without
which
he
was
nothing
,
still
enlarged
upon
his
man
like
a
spectre
,
as
long
as
they
could
bear
it
.
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
as
they
could
bear
no
more
,
they
dropped
off
one
by
one
,
and
lights
twinkled
in
little
casements
;
which
lights
,
as
the
casements
darkened
,
and
more
stars
came
out
,
seemed
to
have
shot
up
into
the
sky
instead
of
having
been
extinguished

<EOS>
The
shadow
of
a
large
high
-
roofed
house
,
and
of
many
over
-
hanging
trees
,
was
upon
Monsieur
the
Marquis
by
that
time
;
and
the
shadow
was
exchanged
for
the
light
of
a
flambeau
,
as
his
carriage
stopped
,
and
the
great
door
of
his

was
opened
to

The
Gorgon
's
Head
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
heavy
mass
of
building
,
that
chateau
of
Monsieur
the
Marquis
,
with
a
large
stone
courtyard
before
it
,
and
two
stone
sweeps
of
staircase
meeting
in
a
stone
terrace
before
the
principal
door
.
<EOS>
A
stony
business
altogether
,
with
heavy
stone
balustrades
,
and
stone
urns
,
and
stone
flowers
,
and
stone
faces
of
men
,
and
stone
heads
of
lions
,
in
all
directions
.
 
<EOS>
As
if
the
Gorgon
's
head
had
surveyed
it
,
when
it
was
finished
,
two
centuries
ago
.
   
<EOS>
Up
the
broad
flight
of
shallow
steps
,
Monsieur
the
Marquis
,
flambeau
preceded
,
went
from
his
carriage
,
sufficiently
disturbing
the
darkness
to
elicit
loud
remonstrance
from
an
owl
in
the
roof
of
the
great
pile
of
stable
building
away
among
the
trees
.
 
<EOS>
All
else
was
so
quiet
,
that
the
flambeau
carried
up
the
steps
,
and
the
other
flambeau
held
at
the
great
door
,
burnt
as
if
they
were
in
a
close
room
of
state
,
instead
of
being
in
the
open
night
-
air
.
 
<EOS>
Other
sound
than
the
owl
's
voice
there
was
none
,
save
the
failing
of
a
fountain
into
its
stone
basin
;
for
,
it
was
one
of
those
dark
nights
that
hold
their
breath
by
the
hour
together
,
and
then
heave
a
long
low
sigh
,
and
hold
their
breath
again
.
   
<EOS>
The
great
door
clanged
behind
him
,
and
Monsieur
the
Marquis
crossed
a
hall
grim
with
certain
old
boar
-
spears
,
swords
,
and
knives
of
the
chase
;
grimmer
with
certain
heavy
riding
-
rods
and
riding
-
whips
,
of
which
many
a
peasant
,
gone
to
his
benefactor
Death
,
had
felt
the
weight
when
his
lord
was
angry
.
   
<EOS>
Avoiding
the
larger
rooms
,
which
were
dark
and
made
fast
for
the
night
,
Monsieur
the
Marquis
,
with
his
flambeau
-
bearer
going
on
before
,
went
up
the
staircase
to
a
door
in
a
corridor
.
 
<EOS>
This
thrown
open
,
admitted
him
to
his
own
private
apartment
of
three
rooms
:
his
bed
-
chamber
and
two
others
.
 
<EOS>
High
vaulted
rooms
with
cool
uncarpeted
floors
,
great
dogs
upon
the
hearths
for
the
burning
of
wood
in
winter
time
,
and
all
luxuries
befitting
the
state
of
a
marquis
in
a
luxurious
age
and
country
.
 
<EOS>
The
fashion
of
the
last
Louis
but
one
,
of
the
line
that
was
never
to
break
 
---
the
fourteenth
Louis
---
was
conspicuous
in
their
rich
furniture
;
but
,
it
was
diversified
by
many
objects
that
were
illustrations
of
old
pages
in
the
history
of
France
.
   
<EOS>
A
supper
-
table
was
laid
for
two
,
in
the
third
of
the
rooms
;
a
round
room
,
in
one
of
the
chateau
's
four
extinguisher
-
topped
towers
.
<EOS>
A
small
lofty
room
,
with
its
window
wide
open
,
and
the
wooden
jalousie
-
blinds
closed
,
so
that
the
dark
night
only
showed
in
slight
horizontal
lines
of
black
,
alternating
with
their
broad
lines
of
stone
colour
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
nephew
,
"
said
the
Marquis
,
glancing
at
the
supper
preparation
;
"
they
said
he
was
not
arrived
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
;
but
,
he
had
been
expected
with
Monseigneur
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
probable
he
will
arrive
to
-
night
;
nevertheless
,
leave
the
table
as
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
ready
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
a
quarter
of
an
hour
Monseigneur
was
ready
,
and
sat
down
alone
to
his
sumptuous
and
choice
supper
.
<EOS>
His
chair
was
opposite
to
the
window
,
and
he
had
taken
his
soup
,
and
was
raising
his
glass
of
Bordeaux
to
his
lips
,
when
he
put
it
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
?
"
<EOS>
he
calmly
asked
,
looking
with
attention
at
the
horizontal
lines
of
black
and
stone
colour
.
   
<EOS>
"
Monseigneur
?
 
<EOS>
That
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Outside
the
blinds
.
 
<EOS>
Open
the
blinds
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
done
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Monseigneur
,
it
is
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
The
trees
and
the
night
are
all
that
are
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
servant
who
spoke
,
had
thrown
the
blinds
wide
,
had
looked
out
into
the
vacant
darkness
,
and
stood
with
that
blank
behind
him
,
looking
round
for
instructions
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
,
"
said
the
imperturbable
master
.
 
<EOS>
"
Close
them
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
That
was
done
too
,
and
the
Marquis
went
on
with
his
supper
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
half
way
through
it
,
when
he
again
stopped
with
his
glass
in
his
hand
,
hearing
the
sound
of
wheels
.
 
<EOS>
It
came
on
briskly
,
and
came
up
to
the
front
of
the
chateau
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ask
who
is
arrived
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
nephew
of
Monseigneur
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
some
few
leagues
behind
Monseigneur
,
early
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
diminished
the
distance
rapidly
,
but
not
so
rapidly
as
to
come
up
with
Monseigneur
on
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
heard
of
Monseigneur
,
at
the
posting
-
houses
,
as
being
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
to
be
told
(
said
Monseigneur
)
that
supper
awaited
him
then
and
there
,
and
that
he
was
prayed
to
come
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
little
while
he
came
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
known
in
England
as
Charles
Darnay
.
   
<EOS>
Monseigneur
received
him
in
a
courtly
manner
,
but
they
did
not
shake
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
left
Paris
yesterday
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
Monseigneur
,
as
he
took
his
seat
at
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
come
direct
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
From
London
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
a
long
time
coming
,
"
said
the
Marquis
,
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
;
I
come
direct
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
not
a
long
time
on
the
journey
;
a
long
time
intending
the
journey
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
detained
by
"
---
the
nephew
stopped
a
moment
in
his
answer
---
"
various
business
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Without
doubt
,
"
said
the
polished
uncle
.
   
<EOS>
So
long
as
a
servant
was
present
,
no
other
words
passed
between
them
.
<EOS>
When
coffee
had
been
served
and
they
were
alone
together
,
the
nephew
,
looking
at
the
uncle
and
meeting
the
eyes
of
the
face
that
was
like
a
fine
mask
,
opened
a
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
back
,
sir
,
as
you
anticipate
,
pursuing
the
object
that
took
me
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
carried
me
into
great
and
unexpected
peril
;
but
it
is
a
sacred
object
,
and
if
it
had
carried
me
to
death
<EOS>
I
hope
it
would
have
sustained
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Not
to
death
,
"
said
the
uncle
;
"
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
,
to
death
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
nephew
,
"
whether
,
if
it
had
carried
me
to
the
utmost
brink
of
death
,
you
would
have
cared
to
stop
me
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
deepened
marks
in
the
nose
,
and
the
lengthening
of
the
fine
straight
lines
in
the
cruel
face
,
looked
ominous
as
to
that
;
the
uncle
made
a
graceful
gesture
of
protest
,
which
was
so
clearly
a
slight
form
of
good
breeding
that
it
was
not
reassuring
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
sir
,
"
pursued
the
nephew
,
"
for
anything
I
know
,
you
may
have
expressly
worked
to
give
a
more
suspicious
appearance
to
the
suspicious
circumstances
that
surrounded
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
said
the
uncle
,
pleasantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
however
that
may
be
,
"
resumed
the
nephew
,
glancing
at
him
with
deep
distrust
,
"
<EOS>
I
know
that
your
diplomacy
would
stop
me
by
any
means
,
and
would
know
no
scruple
as
to
means
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
friend
,
I
told
you
so
,
"
said
the
uncle
,
with
a
fine
pulsation
in
the
two
marks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
me
the
favour
to
recall
that
I
told
you
so
,
long
ago
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
recall
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
the
Marquise
---
very
sweetly
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
His
tone
lingered
in
the
air
,
almost
like
the
tone
of
a
musical
instrument
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
effect
,
sir
,
"
pursued
the
nephew
,
"
I
believe
it
to
be
at
once
your
bad
fortune
,
and
my
good
fortune
,
that
has
kept
me
out
of
a
prison
in
France
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
quite
understand
,
"
returned
the
uncle
,
sipping
his
coffee
.
<EOS>
"
Dare
I
ask
you
to
explain
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
that
if
you
were
not
in
disgrace
with
the
Court
,
and
had
not
been
overshadowed
by
that
cloud
for
years
past
,
a
letter
de
cachet
would
have
sent
me
to
some
fortress
indefinitely
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
possible
,
"
said
the
uncle
,
with
great
calmness
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
the
honour
of
the
family
,
I
could
even
resolve
to
incommode
you
to
that
extent
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
excuse
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
perceive
that
,
happily
for
me
,
the
Reception
of
the
day
before
yesterday
was
,
as
usual
,
a
cold
one
,
"
observed
the
nephew
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
say
happily
,
my
friend
,
"
returned
the
uncle
,
with
refined
politeness
;
"
I
would
not
be
sure
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
A
good
opportunity
for
consideration
,
surrounded
by
the
advantages
of
solitude
,
might
influence
your
destiny
to
far
greater
advantage
than
you
influence
it
for
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
useless
to
discuss
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
,
as
you
say
,
at
a
disadvantage
.
 
<EOS>
These
little
instruments
of
correction
,
these
gentle
aids
to
the
power
and
honour
of
families
,
these
slight
favours
that
might
so
incommode
you
,
are
only
to
be
obtained
now
by
interest
and
importunity
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
sought
by
so
many
,
and
they
are
granted
(
comparatively
)
to
so
few
!
 
<EOS>
It
used
not
to
be
so
,
but
France
in
all
such
things
is
changed
for
the
worse
.
 
<EOS>
Our
not
remote
ancestors
held
the
right
of
life
and
death
over
the
surrounding
vulgar
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
room
,
many
such
dogs
have
been
taken
out
to
be
hanged
;
in
the
next
room
(
my
bedroom
)
,
one
fellow
,
to
our
knowledge
,
was
poniarded
on
the
spot
for
professing
some
insolent
delicacy
respecting
his
daughter
---
HIS
daughter
?
 
<EOS>
We
have
lost
many
privileges
;
a
new
philosophy
has
become
the
mode
;
and
the
assertion
of
our
station
,
in
these
days
,
might
(
I
do
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
would
,
but
might
)
cause
us
real
inconvenience
.
 
<EOS>
All
very
bad
,
very
bad
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
Marquis
took
a
gentle
little
pinch
of
snuff
,
and
shook
his
head
;
as
elegantly
despondent
as
he
could
becomingly
be
of
a
country
still
containing
himself
,
that
great
means
of
regeneration
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
so
asserted
our
station
,
both
in
the
old
time
and
in
the
modern
time
also
,
"
said
the
nephew
,
gloomily
,
"
that
I
believe
our
name
to
be
more
detested
than
any
name
in
France
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
us
hope
so
,
"
said
the
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Detestation
of
the
high
is
the
involuntary
homage
of
the
low
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
not
,
"
pursued
the
nephew
,
in
his
former
tone
,
"
a
face
I
can
look
at
,
in
all
this
country
round
about
us
,
which
looks
at
me
with
any
deference
on
it
but
<EOS>
the
dark
deference
of
fear
and
slavery
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
compliment
,
"
said
the
Marquis
,
"
to
the
grandeur
of
the
family
,
merited
by
the
manner
in
which
the
family
has
sustained
its
grandeur
.
<EOS>
Hah
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
took
another
gentle
little
pinch
of
snuff
,
and
lightly
crossed
his
legs
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
when
his
nephew
,
leaning
an
elbow
on
the
table
,
covered
his
eyes
thoughtfully
and
dejectedly
with
his
hand
,
the
fine
mask
looked
at
him
sideways
with
a
stronger
concentration
of
keenness
,
closeness
,
and
dislike
,
than
was
comportable
with
its
wearer
's
assumption
of
indifference
.
   
<EOS>
"
Repression
is
the
only
lasting
philosophy
.
 
<EOS>
The
dark
deference
of
fear
and
slavery
,
my
friend
,
"
observed
the
Marquis
,
"
will
keep
the
dogs
obedient
to
the
whip
,
as
long
as
this
roof
,
"
looking
up
to
it
,
"
shuts
out
the
sky
.
"
   
<EOS>
That
might
not
be
so
long
as
the
Marquis
supposed
.
 
<EOS>
If
a
picture
of
the
chateau
as
it
was
to
be
a
very
few
years
hence
,
and
of
fifty
like
it
as
they
too
were
to
be
a
very
few
years
hence
,
could
have
been
shown
to
him
that
night
,
he
might
have
been
at
a
loss
to
claim
his
own
from
the
ghastly
,
fire
-
charred
,
plunder
-
wrecked
rains
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
the
roof
he
vaunted
,
he
might
have
found
THAT
shutting
out
the
sky
in
a
new
way
---
to
wit
,
for
ever
,
from
the
eyes
of
the
bodies
into
which
its
lead
was
fired
,
out
of
the
barrels
of
a
hundred
thousand
muskets
.
   
<EOS>
"
Meanwhile
,
"
said
the
Marquis
,
"
I
will
preserve
the
honour
and
repose
of
the
family
,
if
you
will
not
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
must
be
fatigued
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
we
terminate
our
conference
for
the
night
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
moment
more
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
hour
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
the
nephew
,
"
we
have
done
wrong
,
and
are
reaping
the
fruits
of
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
WE
have
done
wrong
?
"
repeated
the
Marquis
,
with
an
inquiring
smile
,
and
delicately
pointing
,
first
to
his
nephew
,
then
to
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Our
family
;
our
honourable
family
,
whose
honour
is
of
so
much
account
to
both
of
us
,
in
such
different
ways
.
 
<EOS>
Even
in
my
father
's
time
,
we
did
a
world
of
wrong
,
injuring
every
human
creature
who
came
between
us
and
our
pleasure
,
whatever
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Why
need
I
speak
of
my
father
's
time
,
when
it
is
equally
yours
?
 
<EOS>
Can
I
separate
my
father
's
twin
-
brother
,
joint
inheritor
,
and
next
successor
,
from
himself
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Death
has
done
that
!
"
said
the
Marquis
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
has
left
me
,
"
answered
the
nephew
,
"
bound
to
a
system
that
is
frightful
to
me
,
responsible
for
it
,
but
powerless
in
it
;
seeking
to
execute
the
last
request
of
my
dear
mother
's
lips
,
and
obey
the
last
look
of
my
dear
mother
's
eyes
,
which
implored
me
to
have
mercy
and
to
redress
;
and
tortured
by
seeking
assistance
and
power
in
vain
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Seeking
them
from
me
,
my
nephew
,
"
said
the
Marquis
,
touching
him
on
the
breast
with
his
forefinger
<EOS>
---
they
were
now
standing
by
the
hearth
---
"
you
will
for
ever
seek
them
in
vain
,
be
assured
.
"
   
<EOS>
Every
fine
straight
line
in
the
clear
whiteness
of
his
face
,
was
cruelly
,
craftily
,
and
closely
compressed
,
while
he
stood
looking
quietly
at
his
nephew
,
with
his
snuff
-
box
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Once
again
he
touched
him
on
the
breast
,
as
though
his
finger
were
the
fine
point
of
a
small
sword
,
with
which
,
in
delicate
finesse
,
he
ran
him
through
the
body
,
and
said
,
   
"
<EOS>
My
friend
,
I
will
die
,
perpetuating
the
system
under
which
I
have
lived
.
"
   
<EOS>
When
he
had
said
it
,
he
took
a
culminating
pinch
of
snuff
,
and
put
his
box
in
his
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
"
Better
to
be
a
rational
creature
,
"
he
added
then
,
after
ringing
a
small
bell
on
the
table
,
"
and
accept
your
natural
destiny
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
are
lost
,
Monsieur
Charles
,
I
see
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
property
and
France
are
lost
to
me
,
"
said
the
nephew
,
sadly
;
"
I
renounce
them
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
they
both
yours
to
renounce
?
 
<EOS>
France
may
be
,
but
is
the
property
?
<EOS>
It
is
scarcely
worth
mentioning
;
but
,
is
it
yet
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
no
intention
,
in
the
words
I
used
,
to
claim
it
yet
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
passed
to
me
from
you
,
to

morrow
---
"
   
"
Which
I
have
the
vanity
to
hope
is
not
probable
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
---
or
twenty
years
hence
---
"
   
"
You
do
me
too
much
honour
,
"
said
the
Marquis
;
"
still
,
I
prefer
that
supposition
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
---
I
would
abandon
it
,
and
live
otherwise
and
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
little
to
relinquish
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
it
but
a
wilderness
of
misery
and
ruin
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hah
!
"
said
the
Marquis
,
glancing
round
the
luxurious
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
the
eye
it
is
fair
enough
,
here
;
but
seen
in
its
integrity
,
under
the
sky
,
and
by
the
daylight
,
it
is
a
crumbling
tower
of
waste
,
mismanagement
,
extortion
,
debt
,
mortgage
,
oppression
,
hunger
,
nakedness
,
and
suffering
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hah
!
"
said
the
Marquis
again
,
in
a
well
-
satisfied
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
ever
becomes
mine
,
it
shall
be
put
into
some
hands
better
qualified
to
free
it
slowly
<EOS>
(
if
such
a
thing
is
possible
)
from
the
weight
that
drags
it
down
,
so
that
the
miserable
people
who
can
not
leave
it
and
who
have
been
long
wrung
to
the
last
point
of
endurance
,
may
,
in
another
generation
,
suffer
less
;
but
it
is
not
for
me
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
curse
on
it
,
and
on
all
this
land
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
?
"
said
the
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Forgive
my
curiosity
;
do
you
,
under
your
new
philosophy
,
graciously
intend
to
live
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
do
,
to
live
,
what
others
of
my
countrymen
,
even
with
nobility
at
their
backs
,
may
have
to
do
some
day
-
work
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
England
,
for
example
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
The
family
honour
,
sir
,
is
safe
from
me
in
this
country
.
 
<EOS>
The
family
name
can
suffer
from
me
in
no
other
,
for
I
bear
it
in
no
other
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
ringing
of
the
bell
had
caused
the
adjoining
bed
-
chamber
to
be
lighted
.
 
<EOS>
It
now
shone
brightly
,
through
the
door
of
communication
.
<EOS>
The
Marquis
looked
that
way
,
and
listened
for
the
retreating
step
of
his
valet
.
   
<EOS>
"
England
is
very
attractive
to
you
,
seeing
how
indifferently
you
have
prospered
there
<EOS>
,
"
he
observed
then
,
turning
his
calm
face
to
his
nephew
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
said
,
that
for
my
prospering
there
,
I
am
sensible
I
may
be
indebted
to
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
rest
,
it
is
my
Refuge
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
say
,
those
boastful
English
,
that
it
is
the
Refuge
of
many
.
<EOS>
You
know
a
compatriot
who
has
found
a
Refuge
there
?
 
<EOS>
A
Doctor
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
a
daughter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
Marquis
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
fatigued
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
bent
his
head
in
his
most
courtly
manner
,
there
was
a
secrecy
in
his
smiling
face
,
and
he
conveyed
an
air
of
mystery
to
those
words
,
which
struck
the
eyes
and
ears
of
his
nephew
forcibly
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
the
thin
straight
lines
of
the
setting
of
the
eyes
,
and
the
thin
straight
lips
,
and
the
markings
in
the
nose
,
curved
with
a
sarcasm
that
looked
handsomely
diabolic
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
repeated
the
Marquis
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
Doctor
with
a
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
So
commences
the
new
philosophy
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
fatigued
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
of
as
much
avail
to
interrogate
any
stone
face
outside
the
chateau
as
to
interrogate
that
face
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
The
nephew
looked
at
him
,
in
vain
,
in
passing
on
to
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
night
!
"
said
the
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
look
to
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
again
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Good
repose
!
 
<EOS>
Light
Monsieur
my
nephew
to
his
chamber
there
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
And
burn
Monsieur
my
nephew
in
his
bed
,
if
you
will
,
"
he
added
to
himself
,
before
he
rang
his
little
ben
again
,
and
summoned
his
valet
to
his
own
bedroom
.
   
<EOS>
The
valet
come
and
gone
,
Monsieur
the
Marquis
walked
to
and
fro
in
his
loose
chamber
-
robe
,
to
prepare
himself
gently
for
sleep
,
that
hot
still
night
.
 
<EOS>
Rustling
about
the
room
,
his
softly
-
slippered
feet
making
no
noise
on
the
floor
,
he
moved
like
a
refined
tiger
:
---
looked
like
some
enchanted
marquis
of
the
impenitently
wicked
sort
,
in
story
,
whose
periodical
change
into
tiger
form
was
either
just
going
off
,
or
just
coming
on
.
   
<EOS>
He
moved
from
end
to
end
of
his
voluptuous
bedroom
,
looking
again
at
the
scraps
of
the
day
's
journey
that
came
unbidden
into
his
mind
;
the
slow
toil
up
the
hill
at
sunset
,
the
setting
sun
,
the
descent
,
the
mill
,
the
prison
on
the
crag
,
the
little
village
in
the
hollow
,
the
peasants
at
the
fountain
,
and
the
mender
of
roads
with
his
blue
cap
pointing
out
the
chain
under
the
carriage
.
 
<EOS>
That
fountain
suggested
the
Paris
fountain
,
the
little
bundle
lying
on
the
step
,
the
women
bending
over
it
,
and
the
tall
man
with
his
arms
up
,
crying
,
"
Dead
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
cool
now
,
"
said
Monsieur
the
Marquis
,
"
and
may
go
to
bed
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
,
leaving
only
one
light
burning
on
the
large
hearth
,
he
let
his
thin
gauze
curtains
fa]J
around
him
,
and
heard
the
night
break
its
silence
with
a
long
sigh
as
he
composed
himself
to
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
The
stone
faces
on
the
outer
wails
stared
blindly
at
the
black
night
for
three
heavy
hours
;
for
three
heavy
hours
,
the
horses
in
the
stables
rattled
at
their
racks
,
the
dogs
barked
,
and
the
owl
made
a
noise
with
very
little
resemblance
in
it
to
the
noise
conventionally
assigned
to
the
owl
by
men
-
poets
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
the
obstinate
custom
of
such
creatures
hardly
ever
to
say
what
is
set
down
for
them
.
   
<EOS>
For
three
heavy
hours
,
the
stone
faces
of
the
chateau
,
lion
and
human
,
stared
blindly
at
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
Dead
darkness
lay
on
all
the
landscape
,
dead
darkness
added
its
own
hush
to
the
hushing
dust
on
all
the
roads
.
 
<EOS>
The
burial
-
place
had
got
to
the
pass
that
its
little
heaps
of
poor
grass
were
undistinguishable
from
one
another
;
the
figure
on
the
Cross
might
have
come
down
,
for
anything
that
could
be
seen
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
village
,
taxers
and
taxed
were
fast
asleep
.
<EOS>
Dreaming
,
perhaps
,
of
banquets
,
as
the
starved
usually
do
,
and
of
ease
and
rest
,
as
the
driven
slave
and
the
yoked
ox
may
,
its
lean
inhabitants
slept
soundly
,
and
were
fed
and
freed
.
   
<EOS>
The
fountain
in
the
village
flowed
unseen
and
unheard
,
and
the
fountain
at
the
chateau
dropped
unseen
and
unheard
---
<EOS>
both
melting
away
,
like
the
minutes
that
were
falling
from
the
spring
of
Time
---
through
three
dark
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
grey
water
of
both
began
to
be
ghostly
in
the
light
,
and
the
eyes
of
the
stone
faces
of
the
chateau
were
opened
.
   
<EOS>
Lighter
and
lighter
,
until
at
last
the
sun
touched
the
tops
of
the
still
trees
,
and
poured
its
radiance
over
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
glow
,
the
water
of
the
chateau
fountain
seemed
to
turn
to
blood
,
and
the
stone
faces
crimsoned
.
 
<EOS>
The
carol
of
the
birds
was
loud
and
high
,
and
,
on
the
weather
-
beaten
sill
of
the
great
window
of
the
bed
-
chamber
of
Monsieur
the
Marquis
,
one
little
bird
sang
its
sweetest
song
with
all
its
might
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
,
the
nearest
stone
face
seemed
to
stare
amazed
,
and
,
with
open
mouth
and
dropped
under
-
jaw
,
looked
awe
-
stricken
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
the
sun
was
full
up
,
and
movement
began
in
the
village
.
<EOS>
Casement
windows
opened
,
crazy
doors
were
unbarred
,
and
people
came
forth
shivering
---
chilled
,
as
yet
,
by
the
new
sweet
air
.
 
<EOS>
Then
began
the
rarely
lightened
toil
of
the
day
among
the
village
population
.
<EOS>
Some
,
to
the
fountain
;
some
,
to
the
fields
;
men
and
women
here
,
to
dig
and
delve
;
men
and
women
there
,
to
see
to
the
poor
live
stock
,
and
lead
the
bony
cows
out
,
to
such
pasture
as
could
be
found
by
the
roadside
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
church
and
at
the
Cross
,
a
kneeling
figure
or
two
;
attendant
on
the
latter
prayers
,
the
led
cow
,
trying
for
a
breakfast
among
the
weeds
at
its
foot
.
   
<EOS>
The
chateau
awoke
later
,
as
became
its
quality
,
but
awoke
gradually
and
surely
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
the
lonely
boar
-
spears
and
knives
of
the
chase
had
been
reddened
as
of
old
;
then
,
had
gleamed
trenchant
in
the
morning
sunshine
;
now
,
doors
and
windows
were
thrown
open
<EOS>
,
horses
in
their
stables
looked
round
over
their
shoulders
at
the
light
and
freshness
pouring
in
at
doorways
,
leaves
sparkled
and
rustled
at
iron
-
grated
windows
,
dogs
pulled
hard
at
their
chains
,
and
reared
impatient
to
be
loosed
.
   
<EOS>
All
these
trivial
incidents
belonged
to
the
routine
of
life
,
and
the
return
of
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
,
not
so
the
ringing
of
the
great
bell
of
the
chateau
,
nor
the
running
up
and
down
the
stairs
;
nor
the
hurried
figures
on
the
terrace
;
nor
the
booting
and
tramping
here
and
there
and
everywhere
,
nor
the
quick
saddling
of
horses
and
riding
away
?
   
<EOS>
What
winds
conveyed
this
hurry
to
the
grizzled
mender
of
roads
,
already
at
work
on
the
hill
-
top
beyond
the
village
,
with
his
day
's
dinner
(
not
much
to
carry
)
lying
in
a
bundle
that
it
was
worth
no
crow
's
while
to
peck
at
,
on
a
heap
of
stones
?
 
<EOS>
Had
the
birds
,
carrying
some
grains
of
it
to
a
distance
,
dropped
one
over
him
as
they
sow
chance
seeds
?
 
<EOS>
Whether
or
no
,
the
mender
of
roads
ran
,
on
the
sultry
morning
,
as
if
for
his
life
,
down
the
hill
,
knee
-
high
in
dust
,
and
never
stopped
till
he
got
to
the
fountain
.
   
<EOS>
All
the
people
of
the
village
were
at
the
fountain
,
standing
about
in
their
depressed
manner
,
and
whispering
low
,
but
showing
no
other
emotions
than
grim
curiosity
and
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
The
led
cows
,
hastily
brought
in
and
tethered
to
anything
that
would
hold
them
,
were
looking
stupidly
on
,
or
lying
down
chewing
the
cud
of
nothing
particularly
repaying
their
trouble
,
which
they
had
picked
up
in
their
interrupted
saunter
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
people
of
the
chateau
,
and
some
of
those
of
the
posting
-
house
,
and
all
the
taxing
authorities
,
were
armed
more
or
less
,
and
were
crowded
on
the
other
side
of
the
little
street
in
a
purposeless
way
,
that
was
highly
fraught
with
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Already
,
the
mender
of
roads
had
penetrated
into
the
midst
of
a
group
of
fifty
particular
friends
,
and
was
smiting
himself
in
the
breast
with
his
blue
cap
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
all
this
portend
,
and
what
portended
the
swift
hoisting
-
up
of
Monsieur
Gabelle
behind
a
servant
on
horseback
,
and
the
conveying
away
of
the
said
Gabelle
(
double
-
laden
though
the
horse
was
)
,
at
a
gallop
,
like
a
new
version
of
the
German
ballad
of
Leonora
?
   
<EOS>
It
portended
that
there
was
one
stone
face
too
many
,
up
at
the
chateau
.
   
<EOS>
The
Gorgon
had
surveyed
the
building
again
in
the
night
,
and
had
added
the
one
stone
face
wanting
;
the
stone
face
for
which
it
had
waited
through
about
two
hundred
years
.
   
<EOS>
It
lay
back
on
the
pillow
of
Monsieur
the
Marquis
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
like
a
fine
mask
,
suddenly
startled
,
made
angry
,
and
petrified
.
 
<EOS>
Driven
home
into
the
heart
of
the
stone
figure
attached
to
it
,
was
a
knife
.
<EOS>
Round
its
hilt
was
a
frill
of
paper
,
on
which
was
scrawled
:
   
"
Drive
him
fast
to
his
tomb
.

<EOS>
Two
Promises
 
More
months
,
to
the
number
of
twelve
,
had
come
and
gone
,
and
Mr
Charles
Darnay
was
established
in
England
as
a
higher
teacher
of
the
French
language
who
was
conversant
with
French
literature
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
age
,
he
would
have
been
a
Professor
;
in
that
age
,
he
was
a
Tutor
.
<EOS>
He
read
with
young
men
who
could
find
any
leisure
and
interest
for
the
study
of
a
living
tongue
spoken
all
over
the
world
,
and
he
cultivated
a
taste
for
its
stores
of
knowledge
and
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
write
of
them
,
besides
,
in
sound
English
,
and
render
them
into
sound
English
.
 
<EOS>
Such
masters
were
not
at
that
time
easily
found
;
Princes
that
had
been
,
and
Kings
that
were
to
be
,
were
not
yet
of
the
Teacher
class
,
and
no
ruined
nobility
had
dropped
out
of
Tellson
's
ledgers
,
to
turn
cooks
and
carpenters
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
tutor
,
whose
attainments
made
the
student
's
way
unusually
pleasant
and
profitable
,
and
as
an
elegant
translator
who
brought
something
to
his
work
besides
mere
dictionary
knowledge
,
young
Mr
Darnay
soon
became
known
and
encouraged
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
well
acquainted
,
more
-
over
,
with
the
circumstances
of
his
country
,
and
those
were
of
ever
-
growing
interest
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
with
great
perseverance
and
untiring
industry
,
he
prospered
.
   
<EOS>
In
London
,
he
had
expected
neither
to
walk
on
pavements
of
gold
,
nor
to
lie
on
beds
of
roses
;
if
he
had
had
any
such
exalted
expectation
,
he
would
not
have
prospered
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
expected
labour
,
and
he
found
it
,
and
did
it
and
made
the
best
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
,
his
prosperity
consisted
.
   
<EOS>
A
certain
portion
of
his
time
was
passed
at
Cambridge
,
where
he
read
with
undergraduates
as
a
sort
of
tolerated
smuggler
who
drove
a
contraband
trade
in
European
languages
,
instead
of
conveying
Greek
and
Latin
through
the
Custom
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
of
his
time
he
passed
in
London
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
from
the
days
when
it
was
always
summer
in
Eden
,
to
these
days
when
it
is
mostly
winter
in
fallen
latitudes
,
the
world
of
a
man
has
invariably
gone
one
way
---
Charles
Darnay
's
way
---
the
way
of
the
love
of
a
woman
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
loved
Lucie
Manette
from
the
hour
of
his
danger
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
never
heard
a
sound
so
sweet
and
dear
as
the
sound
of
her
compassionate
voice
;
he
had
never
seen
a
face
so
tenderly
beautiful
,
as
hers
when
it
was
confronted
with
his
own
on
the
edge
of
the
grave
that
had
been
dug
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
he
had
not
yet
spoken
to
her
on
the
subject
;
the
assassination
at
the
deserted
chateau
far
away
beyond
the
heaving
water
and
the
long
,
tong
,
dusty
roads
---
the
solid
stone
chateau
which
had
itself
become
the
mere
mist
of
a
dream
---
had
been
done
a
year
,
and
he
had
never
yet
,
by
so
much
as
a
single
spoken
word
,
disclosed
to
her
the
state
of
his
heart
.
   
<EOS>
That
he
had
his
reasons
for
this
,
he
knew
full
well
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
again
a
summer
day
<EOS>
when
,
lately
arrived
in
London
from
his
college
occupation
,
he
turned
into
the
quiet
corner
in
Soho
,
bent
on
seeking
an
opportunity
of
opening
his
mind
to
Doctor
Manette
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
close
of
the
summer
day
,
and
he
knew
Lucie
to
be
out
with
Miss
Pross
.
   
<EOS>
He
found
the
Doctor
reading
in
his
arm
-
chair
at
a
window
.
 
<EOS>
The
energy
which
had
at
once
supported
him
under
his
old
sufferings
and
aggravated
their
sharpness
,
had
been
gradually
restored
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
now
a
very
energetic
man
indeed
,
with
great
firmness
of
purpose
,
strength
of
resolution
,
and
vigour
of
action
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
recovered
energy
he
was
sometimes
a
little
fitful
and
sudden
,
as
he
had
at
first
been
in
the
exercise
of
his
other
recovered
faculties
;
but
,
this
had
never
been
frequently
observable
,
and
had
grown
more
and
more
rare
.
   
<EOS>
He
studied
much
,
slept
little
,
sustained
a
great
deal
of
fatigue
with
ease
,
and
was
equably
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
To
him
,
now
entered
Charles
Darnay
,
at
sight
of
whom
he
laid
aside
his
book
and
held
out
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Charles
Darnay
!
 
<EOS>
I
rejoice
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
been
counting
on
your
return
these
three
or
four
days
past
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Stryver
and
Sydney
Carton
were
both
here
yesterday
,
and
both
made
you
out
to
be
more
than
due
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
obliged
to
them
for
their
interest
in
the
matter
,
"
he
answered
,
a
little
coldly
as
to
them
,
though
very
warmly
as
to
the
Doctor
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Manette
---
"
   
"
Is
well
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
as
he
stopped
short
,
"
and
your
return
will
delight
us
all
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
gone
out
on
some
household
matters
,
but
will
soon
be
home
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Doctor
Manette
,
I
knew
she
was
from
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
the
opportunity
of
her
being
from
home
,
to
beg
to
speak
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
blank
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
?
"
said
the
Doctor
,
with
evident
constraint
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bring
your
chair
here
,
and
speak
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
complied
as
to
the
chair
,
but
appeared
to
find
the
speaking
on
less
easy
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
the
happiness
,
Doctor
Manette
,
of
being
so
intimate
here
,
"
so
he
at
length
began
,
"
for
some
year
and
a
half
,
that
I
hope
the
topic
on
which
I
am
about
to
touch
may
not
---
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
stayed
by
the
Doctor
's
putting
out
his
hand
to
stop
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
kept
it
so
a
little
while
,
he
said
,
drawing
it
back
:
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Lucie
the
topic
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
hard
for
me
to
speak
of
her
at
any
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
hard
for
me
to
hear
her
spoken
of
in
that
tone
of
yours
,
Charles
Darnay
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
tone
of
fervent
admiration
,
true
homage
,
and
deep
love
,
Doctor
Manette
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
deferentially
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
another
blank
silence
before
her
father
rejoined
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
you
justice
;
I
believe
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
constraint
was
so
manifest
,
and
it
was
so
manifest
,
too
,
that
it
originated
in
an
unwillingness
to
approach
the
subject
,
that
Charles
Darnay
hesitated
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
go
on
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
Another
blank
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
go
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
anticipate
what
I
would
say
,
though
you
can
not
know
how
earnestly
I
say
it
,
<EOS>
how
earnestly
I
feel
it
,
without
knowing
my
secret
heart
,
and
the
hopes
and
fears
and
anxieties
with
which
it
has
long
been
laden
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Doctor
Manette
,
I
love
your
daughter
fondly
,
dearly
,
disinterestedly
,
devotedly
.
 
<EOS>
If
ever
there
were
love
in
the
world
,
I
love
her
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
loved
yourself
;
let
your
old
love
speak
for
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
sat
with
his
face
turned
away
,
and
his
eyes
bent
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
last
words
,
he
stretched
out
his
hand
again
,
hurriedly
,
and
cried
:
   
"
Not
that
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
Let
that
be
!
 
<EOS>
I
adjure
you
,
do
not
recall
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
cry
was
so
like
a
cry
of
actual
pain
,
that
it
rang
in
Charles
Darnay
's
ears
long
after
he
had
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
He
motioned
with
the
hand
he
had
extended
,
and
it
seemed
to
be
an
appeal
to
Darnay
to
pause
.
<EOS>
The
latter
so
received
it
,
and
remained
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
in
a
subdued
tone
,
after
some
moments
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
doubt
your
loving
Lucie
;
you
may
be
satisfied
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
turned
towards
him
in
his
chair
,
but
did
not
look
at
him
,
or
raise
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
His
chin
dropped
upon
his
hand
,
and
his
white
hair
overshadowed
his
face
:
   
"
<EOS>
Have
you
spoken
to
Lucie
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nor
written
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
ungenerous
to
affect
not
to
know
that
your
self
-
denial
is
to
be
referred
to
your
consideration
for
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
thanks
you
.
   
<EOS>
He
offered
his
hand
;
but
his
eyes
did
not
go
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
said
Darnay
,
respectfully
,
"
how
can
I
fail
to
know
,
Doctor
Manette
,
I
who
have
seen
you
together
from
day
to
day
,
that
between
you
and
Miss
Manette
there
is
an
affection
so
unusual
,
so
touching
,
<EOS>
so
belonging
to
the
circumstances
in
which
it
has
been
nurtured
,
that
it
can
have
few
parallels
,
even
in
the
tenderness
between
a
father
and
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
,
Doctor
Manette
---
how
can
I
fail
to
know
---
that
,
mingled
with
the
affection
and
duty
of
a
daughter
who
has
become
a
woman
<EOS>
,
there
is
,
in
her
heart
,
towards
you
,
all
the
love
and
reliance
of
infancy
itself
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
,
as
in
her
childhood
she
had
no
parent
,
so
she
is
now
devoted
to
you
with
all
the
constancy
and
fervour
of
her
present
years
and
character
,
united
to
the
trustfulness
and
attachment
of
the
early
days
in
which
you
were
lost
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
perfectly
well
that
if
you
had
been
restored
to
her
from
the
world
beyond
this
life
,
you
could
hardly
be
invested
,
in
her
sight
,
with
a
more
sacred
character
than
that
in
which
you
are
always
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
when
she
is
clinging
to
you
,
the
hands
of
baby
,
girl
,
and
woman
,
all
in
one
,
are
round
your
neck
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
in
loving
you
she
sees
and
loves
her
mother
at
her
own
age
,
sees
and
loves
you
at
my
age
,
loves
her
mother
broken
-
hearted
,
loves
you
through
your
dreadful
trial
and
in
your
blessed
restoration
.

I
have
known
this
,
night
and
day

since
I
have
known
you
in
your
home

"
   
<EOS>
Her
father
sat
silent
,
with
his
face
bent
down
.
 
<EOS>
His
breathing
was
a
little
quickened
;
but
he
repressed
all
other
signs
of
agitation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Doctor
Manette
,
always
knowing
this
,
always
seeing
her
and
you
with
this
hallowed
light
about
you
,
I
have
forborne
,
and
forborne
,
as
long
as
it
was
in
the
nature
of
man
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
felt
,
and
do
even
now
feel
,
that
to
bring
my
love
---
even
mine
---
between
you
,
is
to
touch
your
history
with
something
not
quite
so
good
as
itself
.
<EOS>
But
I
love
her
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
is
my
witness
that
I
love
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
,
"
answered
her
father
,
mournfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
thought
so
before
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
,
do
not
believe
,
"
said
Darnay
,
upon
whose
ear
the
mournful
voice
struck
with
a
reproachful
sound
,
"
that
if
my
fortune
were
so
cast
as
that
,
being
one
day
so
happy
as
to
make
her
my
wife
<EOS>
,
I
must
at
any
time
put
any
separation
between
her
and
you
,
I
could
or
would
breathe
a
word
of
what
I
now
say
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
that
I
should
know
it
to
be
hopeless
,
I
should
know
it
to
be
a
baseness
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
any
such
possibility
,
even
at
a
remote
distance
of
years
,
harboured
in
my
thoughts
,
and
hidden
in
my
heart
---
if
it
ever
had
been
there
---
if
it
ever
could
be
there
---
I
could
not
now
touch
this
honoured
hand

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
laid
his
own
upon
it
as
he
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
dear
Doctor
Manette
.
 
<EOS>
Like
you

a
voluntary
exile
from
France

like
you

driven
from
it
by
its
distractions
,
oppressions
,
and
miseries
;
like
you
,
striving
to
live
away
from
it
by
my
own
exertions
,
and
trusting
in
a
happier
future
;
I
look
only
to
sharing
your
fortunes

sharing
your
life
and
home

being
faithful
to
you
to
the
death

Not

divide
with
Lucie
her
privilege

your
child

companion

friend

to
come
in

of
it

bind
her
closer
to
you

if
such
a
thing
can
be

"
   
<EOS>
His
touch
still
lingered
on
her
father
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Answering
the
touch
for
a
moment
,
but
not
coldly
,
her
father
rested
his
hands
upon
the
arms
of
his
chair
,
and
looked
up
for
the
first
time
since
the
beginning
of
the
conference
.
 
<EOS>
A
struggle
was
evidently
in
his
face
;
a
struggle
with
that
occasional
look
which
had
a
tendency
in
it
to
dark
doubt
and
dread
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
speak
so
feelingly
and
<EOS>
so
manfully
,
Charles
Darnay
,
that
I
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
,
and
will
open
all
my
heart

nearly
so

Have
you
any
reason
to
believe
that
Lucie
loves
you

None

none

it
the

at

Not
even
so

<EOS>
I
might
not
have
the
hopefulness

do
it
for
weeks

I

(
mistaken

not
mistaken

have
that

Do

I
ask
none

<EOS>
But
I
have
thought
it
possible
that
you
might
have
it
in
your
power

if
you
should
deem
it
right
,
to
give
me
some

What
is
it

<EOS>

I
well
understand
that

have
no

<EOS>
I
well
understand
that
,
even
if
Miss
Manette
held
me
at
this
moment
in
her
innocent
heart
-
do
not
think
I
have
the
presumption
to
assume
so
much
<EOS>
---
I
could
retain
no
place
in
it
against
her
love
for
her
father
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
that
be
so
,
do
you
see
what
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
involved
in
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
understand
equally
well
,
that
a
word
from
her
father
in
any
suitor
's
favour
,
would
outweigh
herself
and
all
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
For
which
reason

Doctor
Manette

"
said
Darnay
,
modestly
but
firmly
,
"
I
would
not
ask
that
word
,
to
save
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Charles
Darnay
,
mysteries
arise
out
of
close
love
,
as
well
as
out
of
wide
division
;
in
the
former
case
,
they
are
subtle
and
delicate
,
and
difficult
to
penetrate
.
 
<EOS>
My
daughter
Lucie
is
,
in
this
one
respect
,
such
a
mystery
to
me
;
I
can
make
no
guess
at
the
state
of
her
heart
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
,
sir
,
if
you
think
she
is
---
"
As
he
hesitated
,
her
father
supplied
the
rest
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
sought
by
any
other
suitor
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
what
I
meant
to
say
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
father
considered
a
little
before
he
answered
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
Mr
Carton
here
,
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Stryver
is
here
too

occasionally

If
it
be
at
all
,
it
can
only
be
by
one
of
these

"
   
<EOS>
"
Or
both
,
"
said
Darnay
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
not
thought
of
both
;
I
should
not
think
either
,
likely
.
<EOS>
You
want
a
promise
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
what
it
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
that
if
Miss
Manette
should
bring
to
you
at
any
time
,
on
her
own
part
,
such
a
confidence
as
I
have
ventured
to
lay
before
you
,
you
will
bear
testimony
to
what
I
have
said
,
and
to
your
belief
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
may
be
able
to
think
so
well
of
me
,
as
to
urge
no
influence
against
me
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
more
of
my
stake
in
this
;
this
is
what
I
ask
.
<EOS>
The
condition
on
which
I
ask
it
,
and
which
you
have
an
undoubted
right
to
require
,
I
will
observe
immediately
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
give
the
promise
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
"
without
any
condition
.
<EOS>
I
believe
your
object
to
be
,
purely
and
truthfully
,
as
you
have
stated
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
your
intention
is
to
perpetuate
,
and
not
to
weaken
,
the
ties
between
me
and
my
other
and
far
dearer
self
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
should
ever
tell
me
that
you
are
essential
to
her
perfect
happiness
,
I
will
give
her
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
were

Charles
Darnay

there
were

"
   
The
young
man
had
taken
his
hand
gratefully
;
their
hands
were
joined
as
the
Doctor
spoke
:
   
"
---
any
fancies
,
any
reasons
,
any
apprehensions
,
anything
whatsoever
,
new
or
old
,
against
the
man
she
really
loved
---
the
direct
responsibility
thereof
not
lying
on
his
head
---
they
should
all
be
obliterated
for
her
sake
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
everything
to
me
;
more
to
me
than
suffering
,
more
to
me
than
wrong
,
more
to
me
---
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
idle
talk
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
strange
was
the
way
in
which
he
faded
into
silence
,
and
so
strange
his
fixed
look
<EOS>
when
he
had
ceased
to
speak
,
that
Darnay
felt
his
own
hand
turn
cold
in
the
hand
that
slowly
released
and
dropped
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
said
something
to
me
,
"
said
Doctor
Manette
,
breaking
into
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
What
was
it
you
said
to
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
at
a
loss
how
to
answer
,
until
he
remembered
having
spoken
of
a
condition
.
 
<EOS>
Relieved
<EOS>
as
his
mind
reverted
to
that
,
he
answered
:
   
"
<EOS>
Your
confidence
in
me
ought
to
be
returned
with
full
confidence
on
my
part
.
 
<EOS>
My
present
name
,
though
but
slightly
changed
from
my
mother
's
,
is
not
,
as
you
will
remember
,
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
tell
you
what
that
is
,
and
why
I
am
in
England
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Stop
!
"
said
the
Doctor
of
Beauvais
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
it

that
I
may
the
better
deserve
your
confidence

have
no
secret
from
you

"
   
"
Stop
!
"
   
<EOS>
For
an
instant
,
the
Doctor
even
had
his
two
hands
at
his
ears
;
for
another
instant
,
even
had
his
two
hands
laid
on
Darnay
's
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
when
I
ask
you

<EOS>
Willingly

us
together

night

Go

God
bless

<EOS>
It
was
dark
when
Charles
Darnay
left
him
,
and
it
was
an
hour
later
and
darker
when
Lucie
came
home
;
she
hurried
into
the
room
alone
---
for
Miss
Pross
<EOS>
had
gone
straight
up
-
stairs
---
and
was
surprised
to
find
his
reading
-
chair
empty
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
father
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
called
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Father
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
Nothing
was
said
in
answer
,
but
she
heard
a
low
hammering
sound
in
his
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
Passing
lightly
across
the
intermediate
room
,
she
looked
in
at
his
door
and
came
running
back
frightened
,
crying
to
herself
,
with
her
blood
all
chilled
,
"
What
shall
I
do
!
 
<EOS>
What
shall
I
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
uncertainty
lasted
but
a
moment
;
she
hurried
back
,
and
tapped
at
his
door
,
and
softly
called
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
noise
ceased
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
,
and
he
presently
came
out
to
her
,
and
they
walked
up
and
down
together
for
a
long
time
.
   
<EOS>
She
came
down
from
her
bed
,
to
look
at
him
in
his
sleep
that
night
.
<EOS>
He
slept
heavily
,
and
his
tray
of
shoemaking
tools
,
and
his
old
unfinished
work
,
were
all
as
usual
.

A
Companion
Picture
 
"
Sydney
,
"
said
Mr
Stryver
,
on
that
self
-
same
night
,
or
morning
,
to
his
jackal
;
"
mix
another
bowl
of
punch
;
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sydney
had
been
working
double
tides
that
night
,
and
the
night
before
,
and
the
night
before
that
,
and
a
good
many
nights
in
succession
,
making
a
grand
clearance
among
Mr
Stryver
's
papers
before
the
setting
in
of
the
long
vacation
.
 
<EOS>
The
clearance
was
effected
at
last
;
the
Stryver
arrears
were
handsomely
fetched
up
;
everything
was
got
rid
of
until
November
should
come
with
its
fogs
atmospheric
,
and
fogs
legal
,
and
bring
grist
to
the
mill
again
.
   
<EOS>
Sydney
was
none
the
livelier
and
none
the
soberer
for
so
much
application
.
<EOS>
It
had
taken
a
deal
of
extra
wet
-
towelling
to
pull
him
through
the
night
;
a
correspondingly
extra
quantity
of
wine
had
preceded
the
towelling
;
and
he
was
in
a
very
damaged
condition
,
as
he
now
pulled
his
turban
off
and
threw
it
into
the
basin
in
which
he
had
steeped
it
at
intervals
for
the
last
six
hours
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
mixing
that
other
bowl
of
punch
?
"
said
Stryver
the
portly
,
with
his
hands
in
his
waistband
,
glancing
round
from
the
sofa
where
he
lay
on
his
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
look
here
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
tell
you
something
that
will
rather
surprise
you
,
and
that
perhaps
will
make
you
think
me
not
quite
as
shrewd
as
you
usually
do
think
me
.

Yes

And
not
for
money

What
do
you
say
now
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't

disposed

much

Guess

<EOS>

Guess

<EOS>
"
I
am
not
going
to
guess
,
at
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
with
my
brains
frying
and
sputtering
in
my
head
.
<EOS>
if
you
want
me
to
guess
,
you
must
ask
me
to
dinner
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
I
'll
tell
you
,
said
Stryver
,
coming
slowly
into
a
sitting
posture
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sydney
,
I
rather
despair
of
making
myself
intelligible
to
you
,
because
you
are
such
an
insensible
dog

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you

returned
Sydney
,
busy
concocting
the
punch

"

such
a
sensitive
and
poetical
spirit

"
Come

<EOS>
rejoined
Stryver
,
laughing
boastfully
,
"
though
I
do
n't
prefer
any
claim
to
being
the
soul
of
Romance

for
I
hope
I

better

I
am

You

gallantry

Carton

"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
say
gallantry

My
meaning
is
that
I
am
a
man

said
Stryver
,
inflating
himself
at
his
friend
as
he
made
the
punch
,
"
who
cares
more
to
be
agreeable
,
who
takes
more
pains
to
be
agreeable

who
knows
better
how
to
be
agreeable

you
do

<EOS>

Go

<EOS>
"
No

before
I
go
on
,
"
said
Stryver
,
shaking
his
head
in
his
bullying
way
,
I
'll
have
this
out
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
've
been
at
Doctor
Manette
's
house
as
much
as
I
have
,
or
more
than
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
have
been
ashamed
of
your
moroseness
there
!
 
<EOS>
Your
manners
have
been
of
that
silent
and
sullen
and
hangdog
kind
,
that
,
upon
my
life
and
soul
,
I
have
been
ashamed
of
you
,
Sydney
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
should
be
very
beneficial
to
a
man
in
your
practice
at
the
bar
,
to
be
ashamed
of
anything
,
"
returned
Sydney
;
"
you
ought
to
be
much
obliged
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
get
off
in
that
way
,
"
rejoined
Stryver
,
shouldering
the
rejoinder
at
him
;
"
no
,
Sydney
,
it
's
my
duty
to
tell
you
---
and
I
tell
you
to
your
face
to
do
you
good
---
that
you
are
a
devilish
ill
-
conditioned
fellow
in
that
sort
of
society
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
disagreeable
fellow
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sydney
drank
a
bumper
of
the
punch
he
had
made
,
and
laughed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
at
me
!
"
<EOS>
said
Stryver
,
squaring
himself
;
"
I
have
less
need
to
make
myself
agreeable
than
you
have
,
being
more
independent
in
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
I
do
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
you
do
it
yet
,
"
muttered
Carton
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
it
because
it
's
politic
;
I
do
it
on
principle
.
 
<EOS>
And
look
at
me
!
<EOS>
I
get
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
get
on
with
your
account
of
your
matrimonial
intentions
,
"
answered
Carton
,
with
a
careless
air
;
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
keep
to
that
.
<EOS>
As
to
me
---
will
you
never
understand
that
I
am
incorrigible
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
asked
the
question
with
some
appearance
of
scorn
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
business
to
be
incorrigible
,
"
was
his
friend
's
answer
,
delivered
in
no
very
soothing
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
business
to
be
,
at
all
,
that
I
know
of
,

said
Sydney
Carton
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
the
lady
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
do
n't
let
my
announcement
of
the
name
make
you
uncomfortable
,
Sydney
,
"
said
Mr
Stryver
,
preparing
him
with
ostentatious
friendliness
for
the
disclosure
he
was
about
to
make
,
"
because
I
know
you
do
n't
mean
half
you
say
;
and
if
you
meant
it
all
,
it
would
be
of
no
importance
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
this
little
preface
,
because
you
once
mentioned
the
young
lady
to
me
in
slighting
terms
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Certainly
;
and
in
these
chambers
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Sydney
Carton
looked
at
his
punch
and
looked
at
his
complacent
friend
;
drank
his
punch
and
looked
at
his
complacent
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
made
mention
of
the
young
lady
as
a
golden
-
haired
doll
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
lady
is
Miss
Manette
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
had
been
a
fellow
of
any
sensitiveness
or
delicacy
of
feeling
in
that
kind
of
way
,
Sydney
,
I
might
have
been
a
little
resentful
of
your
employing
such
a
designation
;
but
you
are
not
.
<EOS>
You
want
that
sense
altogether
;
therefore
I
am
no
more
annoyed
when
I
think
of
the
expression
,
than
I
should
be
annoyed
by
a
man
's
opinion
of
a
picture
of
mine
,
who
had
no
eye
for
pictures
:
 
or
of
a
piece
of
music
of
mine
,
who
had
no
ear
for
music
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sydney
Carton
drank
the
punch
at
a
great
rate
;
drank
it
by
bumpers
,
looking
at
his
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
you
know
all
about
it
,
Syd
,
"
said
Mr
Stryver
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
about
fortune
:
 
<EOS>
she
is
a
charming
creature
,
and
I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
please
myself
:
 
on
the
whole
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
can
afford
to
please
myself
.
<EOS>
She
will
have
in
me
a
man
already
pretty
well
off
,
and
a
rapidly
rising
man
,
and
a
man
of
some
distinction
:
 
<EOS>
it
is
a
piece
of
good
fortune
for
her
,
but
she
is
worthy
of
good
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
astonished
?
"
   
<EOS>
Carton
,
still
drinking
the
punch
,
rejoined
,
"
Why
should
I
be
astonished
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
approve
?
"
   
<EOS>
Carton
,
still
drinking
the
punch
,
rejoined
,
"
Why
should
I
not
approve
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
his
friend
Stryver
<EOS>
,
"
you
take
it
more
easily
than
I
fancied
you
would
,
and
are
less
mercenary
on
my
behalf
than
I
thought
you
would
be
;
though
,
to
be
sure
,
you
know
<EOS>
well
enough
by
this
time
that
your
ancient
chum
is
a
man
of
a
pretty
strong
will
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
Sydney
,
I
have
had
enough
of
this
style
of
life
,
with
no
other
as
a
change
from
it
;
I
feel
that
it
is
a
pleasant
thing
for
a
man
to
have
a
home
when
he
feels
inclined
to
go
to
it
(
when
he
does
n't
,
he
can
stay
away
)
,
and
I
feel
that
Miss
Manette
will
tell
well
in
any
station
,
and
will
always
do
me
credit
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
have
made
up
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
Sydney
,
old
boy
,
I
want
to
say
a
word
to
YOU
about
YOUR
prospects
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
in
a
bad
way
,
you
know
;
you
really
are
in
a
bad
way
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
the
value
of
money
,
you
Eve
hard
,
you
'll
knock
up
one
of
these
days
,
and
be
ill
and
poor
;
you
really
ought
to
think
about
a
nurse
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
prosperous
patronage
with
which
he
said
it
,
made
him
look
twice
as
big
as
he
was
,
and
four
times
as
offensive
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
let
me
recommend
you
,
"
pursued
Stryver
,
"
to
look
it
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
I
have
looked
it
in
the
face
,
in
my
different
way
;
look
it
in
the
face
,
you
,
in
your
different
way
.
 
<EOS>
Marry
.
 
<EOS>
Provide
somebody
to
take
care
of
you
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
your
having
no
enjoyment
of
women
's
society
,
nor
understanding
of
it
,
nor
tact
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Find
out
somebody
.
 
<EOS>
Find
out
some
respectable
woman
with
a
little
property
---
somebody
in
the
landlady
way
,
or
lodging
-
letting
way
---
and
marry
her
,
against
a
rainy
day
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
kind
of
thing
for
YOU
.
 
<EOS>
Now
think
of
it

Chapter
12
.
<EOS>
The
Fellow
of
Delicacy
 
Mr
Stryver
having
made
up
his
mind
to
that
magnanimous
bestowal
of
good
fortune
on
the
Doctor
's
daughter
,
resolved
to
make
her
happiness
known
to
her
before
he
left
town
for
the
Long
Vacation
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
mental
debating
of
the
point
,
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
as
well
to
get
all
the
preliminaries
done
with
,
and
they
could
then
arrange
at
their
leisure
whether
he
should
give
her
his
hand
a
week
or
two
before
Michaelmas
Term
,
or
in
the
little
Christmas
vacation
between
it
and
Hilary
.
   
<EOS>
As
to
the
strength
of
his
case
,
he
had
not
a
doubt
about
it
,
but
clearly
saw
his
way
to
the
verdict
.
 
<EOS>
Argued
with
the
jury
on
substantial
worldly
grounds
---
the
only
grounds
ever
worth
taking
into
account
<EOS>
---
it
was
a
plain
case
,
and
had
not
a
weak
spot
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
called
himself
for
the
plaintiff
,
there
was
no
getting
over
his
evidence
,
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
threw
up
his
brief
,
and
the
jury
did
not
even
turn
to
consider
.
 
<EOS>
After
trying
it
,
Stryver
,
C*J
,
was
satisfied
that
no
plainer
case
could
be
.
   
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
Mr
Stryver
inaugurated
the
Long
Vacation
with
a
formal
proposal
to
take
Miss
Manette
to
Vauxhall
Gardens
;
that
failing
,
to
Ranelagh
;
that
unaccountably
failing
too
,
it
behoved
him
to
present
himself
in
Soho
,
and
there
declare
his
noble
mind
.
   
<EOS>
Towards
Soho
,
therefore
,
Mr
Stryver
shouldered
his
way
from
the
Temple
,
while
the
bloom
of
the
Long
Vacation
's
infancy
was
still
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Anybody
who
had
seen
him
projecting
himself
into
Soho
while
he
was
yet
on
Saint
Dunstan
's
side
of
Temple
Bar
,
bursting
in
his
full
-
blown
way
along
the
pavement
,
to
the
jostlement
of
all
weaker
people
,
might
have
seen
how
safe
and
strong
he
was
.
   
<EOS>
His
way
taking
him
past
Tellson
's
,
and
he
both
banking
at
Tellson
's
and
knowing
Mr
Lorry
as
the
intimate
friend
of
the
Manettes
,
it
entered
Mr
Stryver
's
mind
to
enter
the
bank
,
and
reveal
to
Mr
Lorry
the
brightness
of
the
Soho
horizon
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
pushed
open
the
door
with
the
weak
rattle
in
its
throat
,
stumbled
down
the
two
steps
,
got
past
the
two
ancient
cashiers
,
and
shouldered
himself
into
the
musty
back
closet
where
Mr
Lorry
sat
at
great
books
ruled
for
figures
,
with
perpendicular
iron
bars
to
his
window
as
if
that
were
ruled
for
figures
too
,
and
everything
under
the
clouds
were
a
sum
.
   
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
said
Mr
Stryver
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
well
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
Stryver
's
grand
peculiarity
that
he
always
seemed
too
big
for
any
place
,
or
space
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
much
too
big
for
Tellson
's
,
that
old
clerks
in
distant
corners
looked
up
with
looks
of
remonstrance
,
as
though
he
squeezed
them
against
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
The
House
itself
,
magnificently
reading
the
paper
quite
in
the
far
-
off
perspective
,
lowered
displeased
,
as
if
the
Stryver
head
had
been
butted
into
its
responsible
waistcoat
.
   
<EOS>
The
discreet
Mr
Lorry
said
,
in
a
sample
tone
of
the
voice
he
would
recommend
under
the
circumstances
,
"
How
do
you
do
,
<EOS>
Mr
Stryver
?
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
,
sir
?
"
and
shook
hands
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
peculiarity
in
his
manner
of
shaking
hands
,
always
to
be
seen
in
any
clerk
at
Tellson
's
who
shook
hands
with
a
customer
when
the
House
pervaded
the
air
.
<EOS>
He
shook
in
a
self
-
abnegating
way
,
as
one
who
shook
for
Tellson
and
Co.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
I
do
anything
for
you
,
Mr
Stryver
?
"
asked
Mr
Lorry
,
in
his
business
character
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
no
,
thank
you
;
this
is
a
private
visit
to
yourself
,
Mr
Lorry
;
I
have
come
for
a
private
word
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
indeed
!
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
bending
down
his
ear
,
while
his
eye
strayed
to
the
House
afar
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
,
"
said
Mr
Stryver
,
leaning
his
arms
confidentially
on
the
desk
:
 
<EOS>
whereupon
,
although
it
was
a
large
double
one
,
there
appeared
to
be
not
half
desk
enough
for
him
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
make
an
offer
of
myself
in
marriage
to
your
agreeable
little
friend
,
Miss
Manette
,
Mr
Lorry
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Lorry
,
rubbing
his
chin
,
and
looking
at
his
visitor
dubiously
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
me
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
repeated
Stryver
,
drawing
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
you
,
sir
?
<EOS>
What
may
your
meaning
be
,
Mr
Lorry
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
meaning
,
"
answered
the
man
of
business
,
"
is
,
of
course
,
friendly
and
appreciative
,
and
that
it
does
you
the
greatest
credit
,
and
---
in
short
,
my
meaning
is
everything
you
could
desire
.
 
<EOS>
But
---
really
,
you
know
,
Mr
Stryver
---
"
Mr
Lorry
paused
,
and
shook
his
head
at
him
in
the
oddest
manner
,
as
if
he
were
compelled
against
his
will
to
add
,
internally
,
"
you
know
there
really
is
so
much
too
much
of
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Stryver
,
slapping
the
desk
with
his
contentious
hand
,
opening
his
eyes
wider
,
and
taking
a
long
breath
,
"
if
I
understand
you
,
Mr
Lorry
,
I
'll
be
hanged
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
adjusted
his
little
wig
at
both
ears
as
a
means
towards
that
end
,
and
bit
the
feather
of
a
pen
.
   
<EOS>
"
D
---
<EOS>
n
it
all
,
sir
!
"
said
Stryver
,
staring
at
him
,
"
am
I
not
eligible
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear

<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
you
're
eligible
!
"
said
Mr
Lorry
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
say
eligible
,
you
are
eligible
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Am
I
not
prosperous
?
"
asked
Stryver
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
if
you
come
to
prosperous
,
you
are
prosperous
,
"
said
 
Mr
Lorry
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
advancing
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
come
to
advancing
you
know
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
delighted
to
be
able
to
make
another
admission
,
"
nobody
can
doubt
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
what
on
earth
is
your
meaning
,
Mr
Lorry
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Stryver
,
perceptibly
crestfallen
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
I
---
Were
you
going
there
now
?
"
asked
Mr
Lorry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Straight
!
<EOS>
"
said
Stryver
,
with
a
plump
of
his
fist
on
the
desk
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
think
I
would
n't
,
if
I
was
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
said
Stryver
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
'll
put
you
in
a
corner
,
"
forensically
shaking
a
forefinger
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
man
of
business
and
bound
to
have
a
reason
.
 
<EOS>
State
your
reason
.
 
<EOS>
Why
would
n't
you
go
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
"
I
would
n't
go
on
such
an
object
without
having
some
cause
to
believe
that
I
should
succeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
D
---
n
ME
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Stryver
,
"
but
this
beats
everything
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
glanced
at
the
distant
House
,
and
glanced
at
the
angry
Stryver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
man
of
business
---
a
man
of
years
---
a
man
of
experience
---
IN
a
Bank
,
"
said
Stryver
;
"
and
having
summed
up
three
leading
reasons
for
complete
success
,
he
says
there
's
no
reason
at
all
!
 
<EOS>
Says
it
with
his
head
on
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Stryver
remarked
upon
the
peculiarity
as
if
it
would
have
been
infinitely
less
remarkable
if
he
had
said
it
with
his
head
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
speak
of
success
,
I
speak
of
success
with
the
young
lady
;
and
when
I
speak
of
causes
and
reasons
to
make
success
probable
,
I
speak
of
causes
and
reasons
that
will
tell
as
such
with
the
young
lady
.
<EOS>
The
young
lady
,
my
good
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
mildly
tapping
the
Stryver
arm
,
"
the
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
lady
goes
before
all
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
mean
to
tell
me
,
Mr
Lorry
,
"
said
Stryver
,
squaring
his
elbows
,
"
that
it
is
your
deliberate
opinion
that
the
young
lady
at
present
in
question
is
a
mincing
Fool
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
exactly
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
to
tell
you
,
Mr
Stryver
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
reddening
,
"
that
I
will
hear
no
disrespectful
word
of
that
young
lady
from
any
lips
;
and
that
if
I
knew
any
man
---
which
I
hope
I
do
not
---
whose
taste
was
so
coarse
,
and
whose
temper
was
so
overbearing
,
that
he
could
not
restrain
himself
from
speaking
disrespectfully
of
that
young
lady
at
this
desk
,
not
even
Tellson
's
should
prevent
my
giving
him
a
piece
of
my
mind
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
necessity
of
being
angry
in
a
suppressed
tone
had
put
Mr
Stryver
's
blood
-
vessels
into
a
dangerous
state
when
it
was
his
turn
to
be
angry
;
Mr
Lorry
's
veins
,
methodical
as
their
courses
could
usually
be
,
were
in
no
better
state
<EOS>
now
it
was
his
turn
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
what
I
mean
to
tell
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
let
there
be
no
mistake
about
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Stryver
sucked
the
end
of
a
ruler
for
a
little
while
,
and
then
stood
hitting
a
tune
out
of
his
teeth
with
it
,
which
probably
gave
him
the
toothache
.
 
<EOS>
He
broke
the
awkward
silence
by
saying
:
   
"
This
is
something
new
to
me
,
Mr
Lorry
.
 
<EOS>
You
deliberately
advise
me
not
to
go
up
to
Soho
and
offer
myself
---
MYself
,
Stryver
of
the
King
's
Bench
bar
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
ask
me
for
my
advice
,
Mr
Stryver
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
give
it
,
and
you
have
repeated
it
correctly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
all
I
can
say
of
it
is
,
"
laughed
Stryver
with
a
vexed
laugh
,
"
that
this
---
ha
,
ha
!
---
beats
everything
past
,
present
,
and
to
come
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
understand
me
,
"
pursued
Mr
Lorry
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
a
man
of
business
,
I
am
not
justified
in
saying
anything
about
this
matter
,
for
,
as
a
man
of
business
,
I
know
nothing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
an
old
fellow
,
who
has
carried
Miss
Manette
in
his
arms
,
who
is
the
trusted
friend
of
Miss
Manette
and
of
her
father
too
,
and
who
has
a
great
affection
for
them
both
,
I
have
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
The
confidence
is
not
of
my
seeking

<EOS>
Now
,
you
think
I
may
not
be
right
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
I

"
said
Stryver
,
whistling
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
undertake
to
find
third
parties
in
common
sense

I
can
only
find
it
for
myself

<EOS>
I
suppose
sense
in
certain
quarters
;
you
suppose
mincing
bread
-
and
-
butter
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
new
to
me
,
but
you
are
right
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
I
suppose
,
Mr
Stryver
,
I
claim
to
characterise
for
myself
---
And
understand
me
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
quickly
flushing
again
,
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
---
not
even
at
Tellson
's
---
have
it
characterised
for
me
by
any
gentleman
breathing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
 
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
!
"
said
Stryver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Granted
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr
Stryver
,
I
was
about
to
say
:
---
it
might
be
painful
to
you
to
find
yourself
mistaken
,
it
might
be
painful
to
Doctor
Manette
to
have
the
task
of
being
explicit
with
you
,
it
might
be
very
painful
to
Miss
Manette
to
have
the
task
of
being
explicit
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
the
terms
upon
which
I
have
the
honour
and
happiness
to
stand
with
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
please
,
committing
you
in
no
way
,
representing
you
in
no
way
,
I
will
undertake
to
correct
my
advice
by
the
exercise
of
a
little
new
observation
and
judgment
expressly
brought
to
bear
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
should
then
be
dissatisfied
with
it
,
you
can
but
test
its
soundness
for
yourself
;
if
,
on
the
other
hand
,
you
should
be
satisfied
with
it
,
and
it
should
be
what
it
now
is
,
it
may
spare
all
sides
what
is
best
spared
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
long
would
you
keep
me
in
town
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
only
a
question
of
a
few
hours
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
go
to
Soho
in
the
evening
,
and
come
to
your
chambers
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
say
yes
,
"
said
Stryver
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
go
up
there
now
<EOS>
,
I
am
not
so
hot
upon
it
as
that
comes
to
;
I
say
yes
,
and
I
shall
expect
you
to
look
in
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
Good
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Then
Mr
Stryver
turned
and
burst
out
of
the
Bank
,
causing
such
a
concussion
of
air
on
his
passage
through
,
that
to
stand
up
against
it
bowing
behind
the
two
counters
,
required
the
utmost
remaining
strength
of
the
two
ancient
clerks
.
 
<EOS>
Those
venerable
and
feeble
persons
were
always
seen
by
the
public
in
the
act
of
bowing
,
and
were
popularly
believed
,
when
they
had
bowed
a
customer
out
,
still
to
keep
on
bowing
in
the
empty
office
until
they
bowed
another
customer
in
.
   
<EOS>
The
barrister
was
keen
enough
to
divine
that
the
banker
would
not
have
gone
so
far
in
his
expression
of
opinion
on
any
less
solid
ground
than
moral
certainty
.
 
<EOS>
Unprepared
as
he
was
for
the
large
pill
he
had
to
swallow
,
he
got
it
down
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
said
Mr
Stryver
,
shaking
his
forensic
forefinger
at
the
Temple
in
general
,
when
it
was
down
,
"
my
way
out
of
this
,
is
,
to
put
you
all
in
the
wrong
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
bit
of
the
art
of
an
Old
Bailey
tactician
,
in
which
he
found
great
relief
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
put
me
in
the
wrong
,
young
lady
,
"
said
Mr
Stryver
;
"
I
'll
do
that
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
when
Mr
Lorry
called
that
night
as
late
as
ten
o'clock
,
Mr
Stryver
,
among
a
quantity
of
books
and
papers
littered
out
for
the
purpose
,
seemed
to
have
nothing
less
on
his
mind
than
the
subject
of
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
even
showed
surprise
when
he
saw
Mr
Lorry
,
and
was
altogether
in
an
absent
and
preoccupied
state
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
that
good
-
natured
emissary
,
after
a
full
half
-
hour
of
bootless
attempts
to
bring
him
round
to
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
to
Soho
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
To
Soho
?
<EOS>
"
repeated
Mr
Stryver
,
coldly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
What
am
I
thinking
of
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
have
no
doubt
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
"
that
I
was
right
in
the
conversation
we
had
.
 
<EOS>
My
opinion
is
confirmed
,
and
I
reiterate
my
advice
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
"
returned
Mr
Stryver
,
in
the
friendliest
way
,
"
that
I
am
sorry
for
it
on
your
account
,
and
sorry
for
it
on
the
poor
father
's
account
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
this
must
always
be
a
sore
subject
with
the
family
;
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
not
,
"
rejoined
Stryver
,
nodding
his
head
in
a
smoothing
and
final
way
;
"
no
matter
,
no
matter
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
it
does
matter
,
"
Mr
Lorry
urged
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
it
does
n't
;
I
assure
you
it
does
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Having
supposed
that
there
was
sense
where
there
is
no
sense
,
and
a
laudable
ambition
where
there
is
not
a
laudable
ambition
,
I
am
well
out
of
my
mistake
,
and
no
harm
is
done
.
 
<EOS>
Young
women
have
committed
similar
follies
often
before
,
and
have
repented
them
in
poverty
and
obscurity
often
before
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
unselfish
aspect
,
I
am
sorry
that
the
thing
is
dropped
,
because
it
would
have
been
a
bad
thing
for
me
in
a
worldly
point
of
view
;
in
a
selfish
aspect
,
I
am
glad
that
the
thing
has
dropped
,
because
it
would
have
been
a
bad
thing
for
me
in
a
worldly
point
of
view
---
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
I
could
have
gained
nothing
by
it
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
harm
at
all
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
proposed
to
the
young
lady
,
and
,
between
ourselves
<EOS>
,
I
am
by
no
means
certain
,
on
reflection
,
that
I
ever
should
have
committed
myself
to
that
extent
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
,
you
can
not
control
the
mincing
vanities
and
giddinesses
of
empty
-
headed
girls
;
you
must
not
expect
to
do
it
,
or
you
will
always
be
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
pray
say
no
more
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
I
regret
it
on
account
of
others
,
but
I
am
satisfied
on
my
own
account
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
really
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
allowing
me
to
sound
you
,
and
for
giving
me
your
advice
;
you
know
the
young
lady
better
than
I
do
;
you
were
right
,
it
never
would
have
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
was
so
taken
aback
,
that
he
looked
quite
stupidly
at
<EOS>
Mr
Stryver
shouldering
him
towards
the
door
,
with
an
appearance
of
showering
generosity
,
forbearance
,
and
goodwill
,
on
his
erring
head
.
<EOS>
"
Make
the
best
of
it
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
said
Stryver
;
"
say
no
more
about
it
;
thank
you
again
for
allowing
me
to
sound
you
;
good
night
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
was
out
in
the
night
,
before
he
knew
where
he
was
.
<EOS>
Mr
Stryver
was
lying
back
on
his
sofa
,
winking
at
his
ceiling
.

Chapter

<EOS>
The
Fellow
of
No
Delicacy
 
<EOS>
If
Sydney
Carton
ever
shone
anywhere
,
he
certainly
never
shone
in
the
house
of
Doctor
Manette
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
there
often
,
during
a
whole
year
,
and
had
always
been
the
same
moody
and
morose
lounger
there
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
cared
to
talk
,
he
talked
well
;
but
,
the
cloud
of
caring
for
nothing
,
which
overshadowed
him
with
such
a
fatal
darkness
,
was
very
rarely
pierced
by
the
light
within
him
.
   
<EOS>
And
yet
he
did
care
something
for
the
streets
that
environed
that
house
,
and
for
the
senseless
stones
that
made
their
pavements
.
 
<EOS>
Many
a
night
he
vaguely
and
unhappily
wandered
there
,
when
wine
had
brought
no
transitory
gladness
to
him
;
many
a
dreary
daybreak
revealed
his
solitary
figure
lingering
there
,
and
still
lingering
there
when
the
first
beams
of
the
sun
brought
into
strong
relief
,
removed
beauties
of
architecture
in
spires
of
churches
and
lofty
buildings
,
as
perhaps
the
quiet
time
brought
some
sense
of
better
things
,
else
forgotten
and
unattainable
,
into
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Of
late
,
the
neglected
bed
in
the
Temple
Court
had
known
him
more
scantily
than
ever
;
and
often
when
he
had
thrown
himself
upon
it
no
longer
than
a
few
minutes
,
he
had
got
up
again
,
and
haunted
that
neighbourhood
.
   
<EOS>
On
a
day
in
August
,
when
Mr
Stryver
(
after
notifying
to
his
jackal
that
"
he
had
thought
better
of
that
marrying
matter
"
)
had
carried
his
delicacy
into
Devonshire
,
and
when
the
sight
and
scent
of
flowers
in
the
City
streets
had
some
waifs
of
goodness
in
them
for
the
worst
,
of
health
for
the
sickliest
,
and
of
youth
for
the
oldest
,
Sydney
's
feet
still
trod
those
stones
.
 
<EOS>
From
being
irresolute
and
purposeless
,
his
feet
became
animated
by
an
intention
,
and
,
in
the
working
out
of
that
intention
,
they
took
him
to
the
Doctor
's
door
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
shown
up
-
stairs
,
and
found
Lucie
at
her
work
,
alone
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
never
been
quite
at
her
ease
with
him
,
and
received
him
with
some
little
 
embarrassment
as
he
seated
himself
near
her
table
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
looking
up
at
his
face
in
the
interchange
of
the
first
few
common
-
places
,
she
observed
a
change
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
you
are
not
well
,
Mr
Carton
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
life
I
lead
,
Miss
Manette
,
is
not
conducive
to
health
.
<EOS>
What
is
to
be
expected
of
,
or
by
,
such
profligates
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
---
forgive
me
;
I
have
begun
the
question
on
my
lips
---
a
pity
to
live
no
better
life
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
God
knows
it
is
a
shame
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
why
not
change
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
Looking
gently
at
him
again
,
she
was
surprised
and
saddened
to
see
that
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
tears
in
his
voice
too
,
as
he
answered
:
   
"
It
is
too
late
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
better
than
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
shall
sink
lower
,
and
be
worse
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
leaned
an
elbow
on
her
table
,
and
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand
.
<EOS>
The
table
trembled
in
the
silence
that
followed
.
   
<EOS>
She
had
never
seen
him
softened
,
and
was
much
distressed
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
her
to
be
so
,
without
looking
at
her
,
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Pray
forgive
me
,
Miss
Manette
.
 
<EOS>
I
break
down
before
the
knowledge
of
what
I
want
to
say
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
hear
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
will
do
you
any
good
,
Mr
Carton
,
if
it
would
make
you
happier
,
it
would
make
me
very
glad
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
for
your
sweet
compassion
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
unshaded
his
face
after
a
little
while
,
and
spoke
steadily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
afraid
to
hear
me
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
shrink
from
anything
I
say
.
<EOS>
I
am
like
one
who
died
young
.
 
<EOS>
All
my
life
might
have
been
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr
Carton
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
that
the
best
part
of
it
might
still
be
;
I
am
sure
that
you
might
be
much
,
much
worthier
of
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Say
of
you
,
Miss
Manette
,
and
although
I
know
better
---
although
in
the
mystery
of
my
own
wretched
heart
I
know
better
---
I
shall
never
forget
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
pale
and
trembling
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
to
her
relief
with
a
fixed
despair
of
himself
which
made
the
interview
unlike
any
other
that
could
have
been
holden
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
had
been
possible
,
Miss
Manette
,
that
you
could
have
returned
the
love
of
the
man
you
see
before
yourself
---
flung
away
,
wasted
,
drunken
,
poor
creature
of
misuse
as
you
know
him
to
be
---
he
would
have
been
conscious
this
day
and
hour
,
in
spite
of
his
happiness
,
that
he
would
bring
you
to
misery
,
bring
you
to
sorrow
and
repentance
,
blight
you
,
disgrace
you
,
pull
you
down
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
very
well
that
you
can
have
no
tenderness
for
me
;
I
ask
for
none
;
I
am
even
thankful
that
it
can
not
be
.

<EOS>
"
Without
it
,
can
I
not
save
you
,
Mr
Carton

Can
I
not
recall
you

forgive
me
again

Can
I
in
no

repay
your
confidence

I
know
this
is
a
confidence

"
she
modestly
said
,
after
a
little
hesitation
,
and
in
earnest
tears
,
"
I
know
you
would
say
this
to
no
one
else

<EOS>
Can
I
turn
it
to
no
good
account
for
yourself

He
shook
his
head

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
none

<EOS>
No

Miss
Manette

to
none

If
you
will
hear
me
through
a
very
little
more
,
all
you
can
ever
do
for
me
is
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
to
know
that
you
have
been
the
last
dream
of
my
soul
.
 
<EOS>
In
my
degradation
I
have
not
been
so
degraded
but
that
the
sight
of
you
with
your
father
,
and
of
this
home
made
such
a
home
by
you
,
has
stirred
old
shadows
that
I
thought
had
died
out
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
Since
I
knew
you
,
I
have
been
troubled
by
a
remorse
that
I
thought
would
never
reproach
me
again
,
and
have
heard
whispers
from
old
voices
impelling
me
upward
,
that
I
thought
were
silent
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
unformed
ideas
of
striving
afresh
,
beginning
anew
,
shaking
off
sloth
and
sensuality
,
and
fighting
out
the
abandoned
fight
.
 
<EOS>
A
dream
,
all
a
dream
<EOS>
,
that
ends
in
nothing
,
and
leaves
the
sleeper
where
he
lay
down
,
but
I
wish
you
to
know
that
you
inspired
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
nothing
of
it
remain
?
 
<EOS>
O
Mr
Carton
,
think
again
!
 
<EOS>
Try
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Miss
Manette
;
all
through
it
,
I
have
known
myself
to
be
quite
undeserving
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
I
have
had
the
weakness
,
and
have
still
the
weakness
,
to
wish
you
to
know
with
what
a
sudden
mastery
you
kindled
me
,
heap
of
ashes
that
I
am
,
into
fire
---
a
fire
,
however
,
inseparable
in
its
nature
from
myself

quickening
nothing
,
lighting
nothing
,
doing
no
service
,
idly
burning
away

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Since
it
is
my
misfortune

Mr

to
have
made
you
more
unhappy
than
you
were
before
you
knew
me

Do
n't

that

you

have
reclaimed
me

anything
could

you
will
not
be
the
cause

my
becoming
worse

Since
the
state

your
mind
that
you
describe

is

at

attributable

some
influence

mine

can
I
use
no

I
no

good

at
all

The
utmost
good
that
I
am
capable
of
now
,
Miss
Manette

I
have
come
here
to
realise
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
carry
through
the
rest
of
my
misdirected
life
,
the
remembrance
that
I
opened
my
heart
to
you
,
last
of
all
the
world
;
and
that
there
was
something
left
in
me
at
this
time
which
you
could
deplore
and
pity
.

<EOS>
"
Which
I
entreated
you
to
believe
,
again

again
,
most
fervently

with
all
my
heart

capable
of
better
things

me
to
believe
it
no
more

proved
myself

I
know
better

I
distress
you
;

draw
fast
to
an
end

<EOS>
Will
you
let
me
believe
,
when
I
recall
this
day
,
that
the
last
confidence
of
my
life
was
reposed
in
your
pure
and
innocent
breast
,
and
that
it
lies
there
alone
,

will
be
shared
by
no
one

If
that
will
be
a
consolation
to
you

yes

Not
even
by
the
dearest
one
ever
to
be
known
to
you

"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Carton
,
"
she
answered
,
after
an
agitated
pause
,
"
the
secret
is
yours

not
mine
;
and
I
promise
to
respect
it

Thank
you

again

<EOS>
He
put
her
hand
to
his
lips
,
and
moved
towards
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Be
under
no
apprehension

Miss
Manette

of
my
ever
resuming
this
conversation

so
much
as
a
passing
word

I
will
never

In

I
shall
hold
sacred

one
good
remembrance

shall
thank

bless
you
for
it

my

was
made

it
otherwise
be
light

<EOS>
He
was
so
unlike
what
he
had
ever
shown
himself
to
be
,
and
it
was
so
sad
to
think
how
much
he
had
thrown
away
,
and
how
much
he
every
day
kept
down
and
perverted
,
that
Lucie
Manette
wept
mournfully
for
him
as
he
stood
looking
back
at
her

"
Be
comforted

said
,
"
I
am
not
worth
such
feeling

An
hour
or
two
hence
,

the
low
companions

low
habits
that
I
scorn

yield
to

will
render

one
I

of

I
will

My
last
supplication
of
all

is
this
;

with
it

I
will
relieve
you
of
a
visitor
with
whom
I
well
know
you
have
nothing
in
unison

between
whom

you
there
is
an
impassable
space

useless

it

it
rises
out
of
my
soul

For
you

for
any
dear

I
would
do
anything

If
my
career
were
of
that
better
kind
that
there
was
any
opportunity

capacity

sacrifice
in
it

I
would
embrace
any
sacrifice

you

for

hold
me
in
your
mind

at
some
quiet
times

as
ardent

sincere
in
this
one
thing

The
time
will
come

the
time
will
not

long
in
coming

when
new

formed
about
you

ties

will
bind
you

more
tenderly

strongly
to
the
home

you
so
adorn

the
dearest
ties

O
Miss

,
when
the
little
picture
of
a
happy
father
's
face
looks
up
in
yours

when
you
see
your
own
bright
beauty
springing
up
anew

think
now

then
that
there
is
a
man

would
give
his
life

to
keep
a
life
you
love

<EOS>
The
Honest
Tradesman
 
<EOS>
To
the
eyes
of
Mr
Jeremiah
Cruncher
,
sitting
on
his
stool
in
Fleet
-
street
with
his
grisly
urchin
beside
him
,
a
vast
number
and
variety
of
objects
in
movement
were
every
day
presented
.
 
<EOS>
Who
could
sit
upon
anything
in
Fleet
-
street
during
the
busy
hours
of
the
day
,
and
not
be
dazed
and
deafened
by
two
immense
processions
,
one
ever
tending
westward
with
the
sun
,
the
other
ever
tending
eastward
from
the
sun
,
both
ever
tending
to
the
plains
beyond
the
range
of
red
and
purple
where
the
sun
goes
down
!
   
<EOS>
With
his
straw
in
his
mouth
,
Mr
Cruncher
sat
watching
the
two
streams
,
like
the
heathen
rustic
who
has
for
several
centuries
been
on
duty
watching
one
stream
---
saving
that
Jerry
had
no
expectation
of
their
ever
running
dry
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
would
it
have
been
an
expectation
of
a
hopeful
kind
,
since
a
small
part
of
his
income
was
derived
from
the
pilotage
of
timid
women
(
mostly
of
a
full
habit
and
past
the
middle
term
of
life
)
from
Tellson
's
side
of
the
tides
to
the
opposite
shore
.
 
<EOS>
Brief
as
such
companionship
was
in
every
separate
instance
,
Mr
Cruncher
never
failed
to
become
so
interested
in
the
lady
as
to
express
a
strong
desire
to
have
the
honour
of
drinking
her
very
good
health
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
was
from
the
gifts
bestowed
upon
him
towards
the
execution
of
this
benevolent
purpose
,
that
he
recruited
his
finances
,
as
just
now
observed
.
   
<EOS>
Time
was
,
when
a
poet
sat
upon
a
stool
in
a
public
place
,
and
mused
in
the
sight
of
men
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
,
sitting
on
a
stool
in
a
public
place
,
but
not
being
a
poet
,
mused
as
little
as
possible
,
and
looked
about
him
.
   
<EOS>
It
fell
out
that
he
was
thus
engaged
in
a
season
when
crowds
were
few
,
and
belated
women
few
,
and
when
his
affairs
in
general
were
so
unprosperous
as
to
awaken
a
strong
suspicion
in
his
breast
that
Mrs
Cruncher
must
have
been
"
flopping
"
in
some
pointed
manner
,
when
an
unusual
concourse
pouring
down
Fleet
-
street
westward
,
attracted
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
that
way
,
Mr
Cruncher
made
out
that
some
kind
of
funeral
was
coming
along
,
and
that
there
was
popular
objection
to
this
funeral
,
which
engendered
uproar
.
   
<EOS>
"
Young
Jerry
,
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
,
turning
to
his
offspring
,
"
it
's
a
buryin
'
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hooroar
,
father
!
"
cried
Young
Jerry
.
   
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
uttered
this
exultant
sound
with
mysterious
significance
.
 
<EOS>
The
elder
gentleman
took
the
cry
so
ill
,
that
he
watched
his
opportunity
,
and
smote
the
young
gentleman
on
the
ear
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
d'ye
mean
?
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
hooroaring
at
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
want
to
conwey
to
your
own
father
,
you
young
Rip

<EOS>
This
boy
is
a
getting
too
many
for
ME

"
said
Mr
Cruncher
,
surveying
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Him
and
his
hooroars
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
me
hear
no
more
of
you
,
or
you
shall
feel
some
more
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
D'ye
hear
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
warn't
doing
no
harm
,
"
Young
Jerry
protested
,
rubbing
his
cheek
.
   
<EOS>
"
Drop
it
then
,
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
;
"
I
wo
n't
have
none
of
YOUR
no
harms
.
 
<EOS>
Get
a
top
of
that
there
seat
,
and
look
at
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
His
son
obeyed
,
and
the
crowd
approached
;
they
were
bawling
and
hissing
round
a
dingy
hearse
and
dingy
mourning
coach
,
in
which
mourning
coach
there
was
only
one
mourner
,
dressed
in
the
dingy
trappings
that
were
considered
essential
to
the
dignity
of
the
position
.
 
<EOS>
The
position
appeared
by
no
means
to
please
him
,
however
,
with
an
increasing
rabble
surrounding
the
coach
,
deriding
him
,
making
grimaces
at
him
,
and
incessantly
groaning
and
calling
out
:
 
"
Yah
!
 
<EOS>
Spies
!
 
<EOS>
Tst
!
 
<EOS>
Yaha
!
<EOS>
Spies
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
many
compliments
too
numerous
and
forcible
to
repeat
.
   
<EOS>
Funerals
had
at
all
times
a
remarkable
attraction
for
Mr
Cruncher
;
he
always
pricked
up
his
senses
,
and
became
excited
,
when
a
funeral
passed
Tellson
's
.
 
<EOS>
Naturally
,
therefore
,
a
funeral
with
this
uncommon
attendance
excited
him
greatly
,
and
he
asked
of
the
first
man
who
ran
against
him
:
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
,
brother
?
 
<EOS>
What
's
it
about
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
\I\
do
n't
know

"
said
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Spies
!
 
<EOS>
Yaha
!
 
<EOS>
Tst

<EOS>
Spies

"
   
<EOS>
He
asked
another
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
\I\
do
n't
know
,
"
returned
the
man
,
clapping
his
hands
to
his
mouth
nevertheless
,
and
vociferating
in
a
surprising
heat
and
with
the
greatest
ardour
,
"
Spies

<EOS>
Yaha
!
 
<EOS>
Tst

<EOS>

"
   
<EOS>
At
length
,
a
person
better
informed
on
the
merits
of
the
case
,
tumbled
against
him
,
and
from
this
person
he
learned
that
the
funeral
was
the
funeral
of
one
Roger
Cly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Was
He
a
spy
?
"
asked
Mr
Cruncher
.
   
<EOS>
"
Old
Bailey
spy
,
"
returned
his
informant
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yaha

"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
to
be
sure
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Jerry
,
recalling
the
Trial
at
which
he
had
assisted
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
seen
him
.
 
<EOS>
Dead
,
is
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dead
as
mutton

"
returned
the
other
,
"
and
ca
n't
be
too
dead
.
<EOS>
Have

<EOS>
Spies

<EOS>
Pull
'em
out

<EOS>
Spies

"
   
<EOS>
The
idea
was
so
acceptable
in
the
prevalent
absence
of
any
idea
,
that
the
crowd
caught
it
up
with
eagerness
,
and
loudly
repeating
the
suggestion
to
have
'em
out
,
and
to
pull
'em
out
,
mobbed
the
two
vehicles
so
closely
that
they
came
to
a
stop
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
crowd
's
opening
the
coach
doors
,
the
one
mourner
scuffled
out
of
himself
and
was
in
their
hands
for
a
moment
;
but
he
was
so
alert
,
and
made
such
good
use
of
his
time
,
that
in
another
moment
he
was
scouring
away
up
a
bye
-
street
,
after
shedding
his
cloak
,
hat
,
long
hatband
,
white
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
and
other
symbolical
tears
.
   
<EOS>
These
,
the
people
tore
to
pieces
and
scattered
far
and
wide
with
great
enjoyment
,
while
the
tradesmen
hurriedly
shut
up
their
shops
;
for
a
crowd
in
those
times
stopped
at
nothing
,
and
was
a
monster
much
dreaded
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
already
got
the
length
of
opening
the
hearse
to
take
the
coffin
out
,
when
some
brighter
genius
proposed
instead
,
its
being
escorted
to
its
destination
amidst
general
rejoicing
.
<EOS>
Practical
suggestions
being
much
needed
,
this
suggestion
,
too
,
was
received
with
acclamation
,
and
the
coach
was
immediately
filled
with
eight
inside
and
a
dozen
out
,
while
as
many
people
got
on
the
roof
of
the
hearse
as
could
by
any
exercise
of
ingenuity
stick
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Among
the
first
of
these
volunteers
was
Jerry
Cruncher
himself
,
who
modestly
concealed
his
spiky
head
from
the
observation
of
Tellson
's
,
in
the
further
corner
of
the
mourning
coach
.
   
<EOS>
The
officiating
undertakers
made
some
protest
against
these
changes
in
the
ceremonies
;
but
,
the
river
being
alarmingly
near
,
and
several
voices
remarking
on
the
efficacy
of
cold
immersion
in
bringing
refractory
members
of
the
profession
to
reason
,
the
protest
was
faint
and
brief
.
 
<EOS>
The
remodelled
procession
started
,
with
a
chimney
-
sweep
driving
the
hearse
---
advised
by
the
regular
driver
,
who
was
perched
beside
him
,
under
close
inspection
,
for
the
purpose
---
and
with
a
pieman
,
also
attended
by
his
cabinet
minister
,
driving
the
mourning
coach
.
<EOS>
A
bear
-
leader
,
a
popular
street
character
of
the
time
,
was
impressed
as
an
additional
ornament
,
before
the
cavalcade
had
gone
far
down
the
Strand
;
and
his
bear
,
who
was
black
and
very
mangy
,
gave
quite
an
Undertaking
air
to
that
part
of
the
procession
in
which
he
walked
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
,
with
beer
-
drinking
,
pipe
-
smoking
,
song
-
roaring
,
and
infinite
caricaturing
of
woe
,
the
disorderly
procession
went
its
way
,
recruiting
at
every
step
,
and
all
the
shops
shutting
up
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
Its
destination
was
the
old
church
of
Saint
Pancras
,
far
off
in
the
fields
.
 
<EOS>
It
got
there
in
course
of
time
;
insisted
on
pouring
into
the
burial
-
ground
;
finally
,
accomplished
the
interment
of
the
deceased
Roger
Cly
in
its
own
way
,
and
highly
to
its
own
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
The
dead
man
disposed
of
,
and
the
crowd
being
under
the
necessity
of
providing
some
other
entertainment
for
itself
,
another
brighter
genius
(
or
perhaps
the
same
)
conceived
the
humour
of
impeaching
casual
passers
-
by
,
as
Old
Bailey
spies
,
and
wreaking
vengeance
on
them
.
<EOS>
Chase
was
given
to
some
scores
of
inoffensive
persons
who
had
never
been
near
the
Old
Bailey
in
their
lives
,
in
the
realisation
of
this
fancy
,
and
they
were
roughly
hustled
and
maltreated
.
 
<EOS>
The
transition
to
the
sport
of
window
-
breaking
,
and
thence
to
the
plundering
of
public
-
houses
,
was
easy
and
natural
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
after
several
hours
,
when
sundry
summer
-
houses
had
been
pulled
down
,
and
some
area
-
railings
had
been
torn
up
,
to
arm
the
more
belligerent
spirits
,
a
rumour
got
about
that
the
Guards
were
coming
.
 
<EOS>
Before
this
rumour
,
the
crowd
gradually
melted
away
,
and
perhaps
the
Guards
came
,
and
perhaps
they
never
came
,
and
this
was
the
usual
progress
of
a
mob
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
did
not
assist
at
the
closing
sports
,
but
had
remained
behind
in
the
churchyard
,
to
confer
and
condole
with
the
undertakers
.
<EOS>
The
place
had
a
soothing
influence
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
procured
a
pipe
from
a
neighbouring
public
-
house
,
and
smoked
it
,
looking
in
at
the
railings
and
maturely
considering
the
spot
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jerry
,
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
,
apostrophising
himself
in
his
usual
way
,
"
you
see
that
there
Cly
that
day
,
and
you
see
with
your
own
eyes
that
he
was
a
young
'
un
and
a
straight
made
'
un
.
"
   
<EOS>
Having
smoked
his
pipe
out
,
and
ruminated
a
little
longer
,
he
turned
himself
about
,
that
he
might
appear
,
before
the
hour
of
closing
,
on
his
station
at
Tellson
's
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
his
meditations
on
mortality
had
touched
his
liver
,
or
whether
his
general
health
had
been
previously
at
all
amiss
,
or
whether
he
desired
to
show
a
little
attention
to
an
eminent
man
,
is
not
so
much
to
the
purpose
,
as
that
he
made
a
short
call
upon
his
medical
adviser
---
a
distinguished
surgeon
---
on
his
way
back
.
   
<EOS>
Young
Jerry
relieved
his
father
with
dutiful
interest
,
and
reported
No
job
in
his
absence
.
 
<EOS>
The
bank
closed
,
the
ancient
clerks
came
out
,
the
usual
watch
was
set
,
and
Mr
Cruncher
and
his
son
went
home
to
tea
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
tell
you
where
it
is
!
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
to
his
wife
,
on
entering
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
,
as
a
honest
tradesman
,
my
wenturs
goes
wrong
to
-
night
,
I
shall
make
sure
that
you
've
been
praying
again
me
,
and
I
shall
work
you
for
it
just
the
same
as
if
I
seen
you
do
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
dejected
Mrs
Cruncher
shook
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
're
at
it
afore
my
face
!
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
,
with
signs
of
angry
apprehension
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
saying
nothing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
;
do
n't
meditate
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
You
might
as
well
flop
as
meditate
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
as
well
go
again
me
one
way
as
another

<EOS>
Drop
it
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Jerry
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Jerry
,
"
repeated
Mr
Cruncher
sitting
down
to
tea
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
It
IS
yes
,
Jerry
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
say
yes
,
Jerry
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
had
no
particular
meaning
in
these
sulky
corroborations
,
but
made
use
of
them
,
as
people
not
unfrequently
do
,
to
express
general
ironical
dissatisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
and
your
yes
,
Jerry
,
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
,
taking
a
bite
out
of
his
bread
-
and
-
butter
,
and
seeming
to
help
it
down
with
a
large
invisible
oyster
out
of
his
saucer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
going
out
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
asked
his
decent
wife
,
when
he
took
another
bite
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
go
with
you
,
father
?
"
<EOS>
asked
his
son
,
briskly
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
you
may
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
going

as
your
mother
knows
---
a
fishing
.
<EOS>
That
's
where
I
'm
going

<EOS>
Going
a
fishing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
fishing

rod

rayther
rusty

do

"
   
<EOS>
"
Never

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
bring
any
fish
home
,
father
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
do
n't
,
you
'll
have
short
commons
,
to

morrow
,
"
returned
that
gentleman
,
shaking
his
head
;
"
that
's
questions
enough
for
you
;
I
ai
n't
a
going
out
,
till
you
've
been
long
abed

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
devoted
himself
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening
to
keeping
a
most
vigilant
watch
on
Mrs
Cruncher
,
and
sullenly
holding
her
in
conversation
that
she
might
be
prevented
from
meditating
any
petitions
to
his
disadvantage
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
he
urged
his
son
to
hold
her
in
conversation
also
,
and
led
the
unfortunate
woman
a
hard
life
by
dwelling
on
any
causes
of
complaint
he
could
bring
against
her
,
rather
than
he
would
leave
her
for
a
moment
to
her
own
reflections
.
 
<EOS>
The
devoutest
person
could
have
rendered
no
greater
homage
to
the
efficacy
of
an
honest
prayer
than
he
did
in
this
distrust
of
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
a
professed
unbeliever
in
ghosts
should
be
frightened
by
a
ghost
story
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
mind
you
!
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
.
 
<EOS>
"
No

morrow

<EOS>
If

as
a

none

<EOS>
If

<EOS>
Then
he
began
grumbling
again
:
   
<EOS>
"
With

you
may
n't
make
the
wittles
and
drink
here
,
by
your
flopping
tricks
and
your
unfeeling
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
your
boy
:
 
<EOS>
he
IS
your'n
<EOS>
,
ai
n't
he
?
 
<EOS>
He
's
as
thin
as
a
lath
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
call
yourself
a
mother
,
and
not
know
that
a
mother
's
first
duty
is
to
blow
her
boy
out
?
"
   
<EOS>
This
touched
Young
Jerry
on
a
tender
place
;
who
adjured
his
mother
to
perform
her
first
duty
,
and
,
whatever
else
she
did
or
neglected
,
above
all
things
to
lay
especial
stress
on
the
discharge
of
that
maternal
function
so
affectingly
and
delicately
indicated
by
his
other
parent
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
the
evening
wore
away
with
the
Cruncher
family
,
until
Young
Jerry
was
ordered
to
bed
,
and
his
mother
,
laid
under
similar
injunctions
,
obeyed
them
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
beguiled
the
earlier
watches
of
the
night
with
solitary
pipes
,
and
did
not
start
upon
his
excursion
until
nearly
one
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
Towards
that
small
and
ghostly
hour
,
he
rose
up
from
his
chair
,
took
a
key
out
of
his
pocket
,
opened
a
locked
cupboard
,
and
brought
forth
a
sack
,
a
crowbar
of
convenient
size
,
a
rope
and
chain
,
and
other
fishing
tackle
of
that
nature
.
 
<EOS>
Disposing
these
articles
about
him
in
skilful
manner
,
he
bestowed
a
parting
defiance
on
Mrs
Cruncher
,
extinguished
the
light
,
and
went
out
.
   
<EOS>
Young
Jerry
,
who
had
only
made
a
feint
of
undressing
when
he
went
to
bed
,
was
not
long
after
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
Under
cover
of
the
darkness
he
followed
out
of
the
room
,
followed
down
the
stairs
,
followed
down
the
court
,
followed
out
into
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
no
uneasiness
concerning
his
getting
into
the
house
again
,
for
it
was
full
of
lodgers
,
and
the
door
stood
ajar
all
night
.
   
<EOS>
Impelled
by
a
laudable
ambition
to
study
the
art
and
mystery
of
his
father
's
honest
calling
,
Young
Jerry
,
keeping
as
close
to
house
fronts
,
walls
,
and
doorways
,
as
his
eyes
were
close
to
one
another
,
held
his
honoured
parent
in
view
.
 
<EOS>
The
honoured
parent
steering
Northward
,
had
not
gone
far
,
when
he
was
joined
by
another
disciple
of
Izaak
Walton
,
and
the
two
trudged
on
together
.
   
<EOS>
Within
half
an
hour
from
the
first
starting
,
they
were
beyond
the
winking
lamps
,
and
the
more
than
winking
watchmen
,
and
were
out
upon
a
lonely
road
.
 
<EOS>
Another
fisherman
was
picked
up
here
---
and
that
so
silently
,
that
if
Young
Jerry
had
been
superstitious
,
he
might
have
supposed
the
second
follower
of
the
gentle
craft
to
have
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
split
himself
into
two
.
   
<EOS>
The
three
went
on
,
and
Young
Jerry
went
on
,
until
the
three
stopped
under
a
bank
overhanging
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
the
top
of
the
bank
was
a
low
brick
wall
,
surmounted
by
an
iron
railing
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
shadow
of
bank
and
wall
the
three
turned
out
of
the
road
,
and
up
a
blind
lane
,
of
which
the
wall
---
there
,
risen
to
some
eight
or
ten
feet
high
---
formed
one
side
.
<EOS>
Crouching
down
in
a
corner
,
peeping
up
the
lane
,
the
next
object
that
Young
Jerry
saw
,
was
the
form
of
his
honoured
parent
,
pretty
well
defined
against
a
watery
and
clouded
moon
,
nimbly
scaling
an
iron
gate
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
soon
over
,
and
then
the
second
fisherman
got
over
,
and
then
the
third
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
dropped
softly
on
the
ground
within
the
gate
,
and
lay
there
a
little
---
listening
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
they
moved
away
on
their
hands
and
knees
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
now
Young
Jerry
's
turn
to
approach
the
gate
:
 
which
he
did
,
holding
his
breath
.
 
<EOS>
Crouching
down
again
in
a
corner
there
,
and
looking
in
,
he
made
out
the
three
fishermen
creeping
through
some
rank
grass
!
<EOS>
and
all
the
gravestones
in
the
churchyard
---
it
was
a
large
churchyard
that
they
were
in
---
looking
on
like
ghosts
in
white
,
while
the
church
tower
itself
looked
on
Eke
the
ghost
of
a
monstrous
giant
.
 
<EOS>
They
did
not
creep
far
,
before
they
stopped
and
stood
upright
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
they
began
to
fish
.
   
<EOS>
They
fished
with
a
spade
,
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
the
honoured
parent
appeared
to
be
adjusting
some
instrument
like
a
great
corkscrew
.
<EOS>
Whatever
tools
they
worked
with
,
they
worked
hard
,
until
the
awful
striking
of
the
church
clock
so
terrified
Young
Jerry
,
that
he
made
off
,
with
his
hair
as
stiff
as
his
father
's
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
his
long
-
cherished
desire
to
know
more
about
these
matters
,
not
only
stopped
him
in
his
running
away
,
but
lured
him
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
still
fishing
perseveringly
,
when
he
peeped
in
at
the
gate
for
the
second
time
;
but
,
now
they
seemed
to
have
got
a
bite
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
screwing
and
complaining
sound
down
below
,
and
their
bent
figures
were
strained
,
as
if
by
a
weight
.
 
<EOS>
By
slow
degrees
the
weight
broke
away
the
earth
upon
it
,
and
came
to
the
surface
.
 
<EOS>
Young
Jerry
very
well
knew
what
it
would
be
;
but
,
when
he
saw
it
,
and
saw
his
honoured
parent
about
to
wrench
it
open
,
he
was
so
frightened
,
being
new
to
the
sight
,
that
he
made
off
again
,
and
never
stopped
until
he
had
run
a
mile
or
more
.
   
<EOS>
He
would
not
have
stopped
then
,
for
anything
less
necessary
than
breath
,
it
being
a
spectral
sort
of
race
that
he
ran
,
and
one
highly
desirable
to
get
to
the
end
of
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
strong
idea
that
the
coffin
he
had
seen
was
running
after
him
;
and
,
pictured
as
hopping
on
behind
him
,
bolt
upright
,
upon
its
narrow
end
,
always
on
the
point
of
overtaking
him
and
hopping
on
at
his
side
---
perhaps
taking
his
arm
<EOS>
---
it
was
a
pursuer
to
shun
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
inconsistent
and
ubiquitous
fiend
too
,
for
,
while
it
was
making
the
whole
night
behind
him
dreadful
,
he
darted
out
into
the
roadway
to
avoid
dark
alleys
,
fearful
of
its
coming
hopping
out
of
them
like
a
dropsical
boy's
-
Kite
without
tail
and
wings
.
 
<EOS>
It
hid
in
doorways
too
,
rubbing
its
horrible
shoulders
against
doors
,
and
drawing
them
up
to
its
ears
,
as
if
it
were
laughing
.
<EOS>
It
got
into
shadows
on
the
road
,
and
lay
cunningly
on
its
back
to
trip
him
up
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
it
was
incessantly
hopping
on
behind
and
gaining
on
him
,
so
that
when
the
boy
got
to
his
own
door
he
had
reason
for
being
half
dead
.
 
<EOS>
And
even
then
it
would
not
leave
him
,
but
followed
him
upstairs
with
a
bump
on
every
stair
,
scrambled
into
bed
with
him
,
and
bumped
down
,
dead
and
heavy
,
on
his
breast
when
he
fell
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
From
his
oppressed
slumber
,
Young
Jerry
in
his
closet
was
awakened
after
daybreak
and
before
sunrise
,
by
the
presence
of
his
father
in
the
family
room
.
 
<EOS>
Something
had
gone
wrong
with
him
;
at
least
,
so
Young
Jerry
inferred
,
from
the
circumstance
of
his
holding
Mrs
Cruncher
by
the
ears
,
and
knocking
the
back
of
her
head
against
the
head
-
board
of
the
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
I
would
,
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
,
"
and
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Jerry
,
Jerry
,
Jerry
!
"
<EOS>
his
wife
implored
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
oppose
yourself
to
the
profit
of
the
business
,
"
said
Jerry
,
"
and
me
and
my
partners
suffer
.
 
<EOS>
You
was
to
honour
and
obey
;
why
the
devil
do
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
try
to
be
a
good
wife
,
Jerry
,
"
the
poor
woman
protested
,
with
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
being
a
good
wife
to
oppose
your
husband
's
business
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
honouring
your
husband
to
dishonour
his
business
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
obeying
your
husband
to
disobey
him
on
the
wital
subject
of
his
business
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
n't
taken
to
the
dreadful
business
then
,
Jerry
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
enough
for
you
,
"
retorted
Mr
Cruncher
,
"
to
be
the
wife
of
a
honest
tradesman
,
and
not
to
occupy
your
female
mind
with
calculations
when
he
took
to
his
trade
or
when
he
did
n't
.
 
<EOS>
A
honouring
and
obeying
wife
would
let
his
trade
alone
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
Call
yourself
a
religious
woman
?
 
<EOS>
If
you
're
a
religious
woman
,
give
me
a
irreligious
one
!
<EOS>
You
have
no
more
nat'ral
sense
of
duty
than
the
bed
of
this
here
<EOS>
Thames
river
has
of
a
pile
,
and
similarly
it
must
be
knocked
into
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
altercation
was
conducted
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
,
and
terminated
in
the
honest
tradesman
's
kicking
off
his
clay
-
soiled
boots
,
and
lying
down
at
his
length
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
After
taking
a
timid
peep
at
him
lying
on
his
back
,
with
his
rusty
hands
under
his
head
for
a
pillow
,
his
son
lay
down
too
,
and
fell
asleep
again
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
fish
for
breakfast
,
and
not
much
of
anything
else
.
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
was
out
of
spirits
,
and
out
of
temper
,
and
kept
an
iron
pot
-
lid
by
him
as
a
projectile
for
the
correction
of
Mrs
Cruncher
,
in
case
he
should
observe
any
symptoms
of
her
saying
Grace
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
brushed
and
washed
at
the
usual
hour
,
and
set
off
with
his
son
to
pursue
his
ostensible
calling
.
   
<EOS>
Young
Jerry
,
walking
with
the
stool
under
his
arm
at
his
father
's
side
along
sunny
and
crowded
Fleet
-
street
,
was
a
very
different
Young
Jerry
from
him
of
the
previous
night
,
running
home
through
darkness
and
solitude
from
his
grim
pursuer
.
 
<EOS>
His
cunning
was
fresh
with
the
day
,
and
his
qualms
were
gone
with
the
night
---
in
which
particulars
it
is
not
improbable
that
he
had
compeers
in
Fleet
-
street
and
the
City
of
London
,
that
fine
morning
.
   
<EOS>
"
Father
,
"
said
Young
Jerry
,
as
they
walked
along
:
 
taking
care
to
keep
at
arm
's
length
and
to
have
the
stool
well
between
them
:
"
what
's
a
Resurrection
-
Man
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
came
to
a
stop
on
the
pavement
before
he
answered
,
"
How
should
I
know
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
knowed
everything
,
father
,
"
said
the
artless
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
"
returned
Mr
Cruncher
,
going
on
again
,
and
lifting
off
his
hat
to
give
his
spikes
free
play
,
"
he
's
a
tradesman
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
his
goods
,
father
?
"
asked
the
brisk
Young
Jerry
.
   
<EOS>
"
His
goods
,
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
,
after
turning
it
over
in
his
mind
,
"
is
a
branch
of
Scientific
goods
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Persons
'
bodies
,
ai
n't
it

"
asked
the
lively
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
is
something
of
that
sort
,
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
father
,
I
should
so
like
to
be
a
Resurrection
-
Man
when
I
'm
quite
growed
up
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
was
soothed
,
but
shook
his
head
in
a
dubious
and
moral
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
depends
upon
how
you
dewelop
your
talents
.
 
<EOS>
Be
careful
to
dewelop
your
talents
,
and
never
to
say
no
more
than
you
can
help
to
nobody
,
and
there
's
no
telling
at
the
present
time
what
you
may
not
come
to
be
fit
for
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
Young
Jerry
,
thus
encouraged
,
went
on
a
few
yards
in
advance
,
to
plant
the
stool
in
the
shadow
of
the
Bar
,
Mr
Cruncher
added
to
himself
:
 
<EOS>
"
Jerry
,
you
honest
tradesman
,
there
's
hopes
wot
<EOS>
that

will
yet
be
a
blessing
to
you

a
recompense
to
you
for

There
had
been
earlier
drinking
than
usual
in
the
wine
-
shop
of
Monsieur
Defarge
.
 
<EOS>
As
early
as
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
sallow
faces
peeping
through
its
barred
windows
had
descried
other
faces
within
,
bending
over
measures
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
Defarge
sold
a
very
thin
wine
at
the
best
of
times
,
but
it
would
seem
to
have
been
an
unusually
thin
wine
that
he
sold
at
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
A
sour
wine
,
moreover
,
or
a
souring
,
for
its
influence
on
the
mood
of
those
who
drank
it
was
to
make
them
gloomy
.
 
<EOS>
No
vivacious
Bacchanalian
flame
leaped
out
of
the
pressed
grape
of
Monsieur
Defarge
:
 
<EOS>
but
,
a
smouldering
fire
that
burnt
in
the
dark
,
lay
hidden
in
the
dregs
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
This
had
been
the
third
morning
in
succession
,
<EOS>
on
which
there
had
been
early
drinking
at
the
wine
-
shop
of
Monsieur
Defarge
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
begun
on
Monday
,
and
here
was
Wednesday
come
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
been
more
of
early
brooding
than
drinking
;
for
,
many
men
had
listened
and
whispered
and
slunk
about
there
from
the
time
of
the
opening
of
the
door
,
who
could
not
have
laid
a
piece
of
money
on
the
counter
to
save
their
souls
.
<EOS>
These
were
to
the
full
as
interested
in
the
place
,
however
,
as
if
they
could
have
commanded
whole
barrels
of
wine
;
and
they
glided
from
seat
to
seat
,
and
from
corner
to
corner
,
swallowing
talk
in
lieu
of
drink
,
with
greedy
looks
.
   
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
an
unusual
flow
of
company
,
the
master
of
the
wine

shop
was
not
visible
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
missed
;
for
,
nobody
who
crossed
the
threshold
looked
for
him
<EOS>
,
nobody
asked
for
him
,
nobody
wondered
to
see
only
Madame
Defarge
in
her
seat
,
presiding
over
the
distribution
of
wine
,
with
a
bowl
of
battered
small
coins
before
her
,
as
much
defaced
and
beaten
out
of
their
original
impress
as
the
small
coinage
of
humanity
from
whose
ragged
pockets
they
had
come
.
   
<EOS>
A
suspended
interest
and
a
prevalent
absence
of
mind
,
were
perhaps
observed
by
the
spies
who
looked
in
at
the
wine
-
shop
,
as
they
looked
in
at
every
place
,
high
and
low
,
from
the
kings
palace
to
the
criminal
's
gaol
.
 
<EOS>
Games
at
cards
languished
,
players
at
dominoes
musingly
built
towers
with
them
,
drinkers
drew
figures
on
the
tables
with
spilt
drops
of
wine
,
Madame
Defarge
herself
picked
out
the
pattern
on
her
sleeve
with
her
toothpick
,
and
saw
and
heard
something
inaudible
and
invisible
a
long
way
off
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
,
Saint
Antoine
in
this
vinous
feature
of
his
,
until
midday
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
high
noontide
,
when
two
dusty
men
passed
through
his
streets
and
under
his
swinging
lamps
:
 
of
whom
,
one
was
Monsieur
Defarge
:
 
the
other
a
mender
of
roads
in
a
blue
cap
.
 
<EOS>
All
adust
and
athirst
,
the
two
entered
the
wine
-
shop
.
 
<EOS>
Their
arrival
had
lighted
a
kind
of
fire
in
the
breast
of
Saint
Antoine
,
fast
spreading
as
they
came
along
,
which
stirred
and
flickered
in
flames
of
faces
at
most
doors
and
windows
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
no
one
had
followed
them
,
and
no
man
spoke
when
they
entered
the
wine
-
shop
,
though
the
eyes
of
every
man
there
were
turned
upon
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
day
,
gentlemen
!
"
said
Monsieur
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
It
may
have
been
a
signal
for
loosening
the
general
tongue
.
<EOS>
It
elicited
an
answering
chorus
of
"
Good
day
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
bad
weather
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Defarge
,
shaking
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
every
man
looked
at
his
neighbour
,
and
then
an
cast
down
their
eyes
and
sat
silent
.
 
<EOS>
Except
one
man
,
who
got
up
and
went
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
wife
,
"
said
Defarge
aloud
,
addressing
Madame
Defarge
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
travelled
certain
leagues
with
this
good
mender
of
roads
,
called
Jacques
.
 
<EOS>
I
met
him
---
by
accident
---
a
day
and
half
's
journey
out
of
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
good
child
,
this
mender
of
roads
,
called
Jacques
.
<EOS>
Give
him
to
drink
,
my
wife
!
"
   
<EOS>
A
second
man
got
up
and
went
out
.
 
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
set
wine
before
the
mender
of
roads
called
Jacques
,
who
doffed
his
blue
cap
to
the
company
,
and
drank
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
breast
of
his
blouse
he
carried
some
coarse
dark
bread
;
he
ate
of
this
between
whiles
,
and
sat
munching
and
drinking
near
Madame
Defarge
's
counter
.
 
<EOS>
A
third
man
got
up
and
went
out
.
   
<EOS>
Defarge
refreshed
himself
with
a
draught
of
wine
---
but
,
he
took
less
than
was
given
to
the
stranger
,
as
being
himself
a
man
to
whom
it
was
no
rarity
---
and
stood
waiting
until
the
countryman
had
made
his
breakfast
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
no
one
present
,
and
no
one
now
looked
at
him
;
not
even
Madame
Defarge
,
who
had
taken
up
her
knitting
,
and
was
at
work
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
finished
your
repast
,
friend
?
"
he
asked
,
in
due
season
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
thank
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
then
!
 
<EOS>
You
shall
see
the
apartment
that
I
told
you
you
could
occupy
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
suit
you
to
a
marvel
.
"
   
<EOS>
Out
of
the
wine
-
shop
into
the
street
,
out
of
the
street
into
a
courtyard
,
out
of
the
courtyard
up
a
steep
staircase
,
out
of
the
staircase
into
a
garret
,
---
formerly
the
garret
where
a
white
-
haired
man
sat
on
a
low
bench
,
stooping
forward
and
very
busy
,
making
shoes
.
   
<EOS>
No
white
-
haired
man
was
there
now
;
but
,
the
three
men
were
there
who
had
gone
out
of
the
wine
-
shop
singly
.
 
<EOS>
And
between
them
and
the
white
-
haired
man
afar
off
,
was
the
one
small
link
,
that
they
had
once
looked
in
at
him
through
the
chinks
in
the
wall
.
   
<EOS>
Defarge
closed
the
door
carefully
,
and
spoke
in
a
subdued
voice
:
   
"
Jacques
One
,
Jacques
Two
,
Jacques
Three
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
witness
encountered
by
appointment
,
by
me
,
Jacques
Four
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
tell
you
all
.
<EOS>
Speak
,
Jacques
Five
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
mender
of
roads
,
blue
cap
in
hand
,
wiped
his
swarthy
forehead
with
it
,
and
said
,
"
Where
shall
I
commence
,
monsieur
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Commence
,
"
was
Monsieur
Defarge
's
not
unreasonable
reply
,
"
at
the
commencement
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
saw
him
then
,
messieurs
,
"
began
the
mender
of
roads
,
"
a
year
ago
this
running
summer
,
underneath
the
carriage
of
the
Marquis
,
hanging
by
the
chain
.
 
<EOS>
Behold
the
manner
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
leaving
my
work
on
the
road
,
the
sun
going
to
bed
,
the
carriage
of
the
Marquis
slowly
ascending
the
hill
,
he
hanging
by
the
chain
---
like
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
Again
the
mender
of
roads
went
through
the
whole
performance
;
in
which
he
ought
to
have
been
perfect
by
that
time
,
seeing
that
it
had
been
the
infallible
resource
and
indispensable
entertainment
of
his
village
during
a
whole
year
.
   
<EOS>
Jacques
One
struck
in
,
and
asked
if
he
had
ever
seen
the
man
before
?
   
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
answered
the
mender
of
roads
,
recovering
his
perpendicular
.
   
<EOS>
Jacques
Three
demanded
how
he
afterwards
recognised
him
then
?
   
<EOS>
"
By
his
tall
figure
,
"
said
the
mender
of
roads
,
softly
,
and
with
his
finger
at
his
nose
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
Monsieur
the
Marquis
demands
that
evening
,
"
Say
,
what
is
he
like
?
<EOS>
"
I
make
response
,
"
Tall
as
a
spectre
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
You
should
have
said
,
short
as
a
dwarf
,
"
returned
Jacques
Two
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
what
did
I
know
?
 
<EOS>
The
deed
was
not
then
accomplished
,
neither
did
he
confide
in
me
.
 
<EOS>
Observe
!
 
<EOS>
Under
those
circumstances
even
,
I
do
not
offer
my
testimony
.
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
the
Marquis
indicates
me
with
his
finger
,
standing
near
our
little
fountain
,
and
says
,
"
To
me
!
 
<EOS>
Bring
that
rascal
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
faith
,
messieurs
,
I
offer
nothing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
right
there
,
Jacques
,
"
murmured
Defarge
,
to
him
who
had
interrupted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
on
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
mender
of
roads
,
with
an
air
of
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
tall
man
is
lost
,
and
he
is
sought
---
<EOS>
how
many
months
?
 
<EOS>
Nine
,
ten
,
eleven
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
matter
,
the
number
,
"
said
Defarge
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
well
hidden
,
but
at
last
he
is
unluckily
found
.
 
<EOS>
Go
on
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
again
at
work
upon
the
hill
-
side
,
and
the
sun
is
again
about
to
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
collecting
my
tools
to
descend
to
my
cottage
down
in
the
village
below
,
where
it
is
already
dark
,
when
I
raise
my
eyes
,
and
see
coming
over
the
hill
six
soldiers
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
them
is
a
tall
man
with
his
arms
bound
---
tied
to
his
sides
---
like
this
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
the
aid
of
his
indispensable
cap
,
he
represented
a
man
with
his
elbows
bound
fast
at
his
hips
,
with
cords
that
were
knotted
behind
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
stand
aside
,
messieurs
,
by
my
heap
of
stones
,
to
see
the
soldiers
and
their
prisoner
pass
(
for
it
is
a
solitary
road
,
that
,
where
any
spectacle
is
well
worth
looking
at
)
,
and
at
first
,
as
they
approach
,
I
see
no
more
than
that
they
are
six
soldiers
with
a
tall
man
bound
,
and
that
they
are
almost
black
to
my
sight
---
except
on
the
side
of
the
sun
going
to
bed
,
where
they
have
a
red
edge
,
messieurs
.
 
<EOS>
Also
,
I
see
that
their
long
shadows
are
on
the
hollow
ridge
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
,
and
are
on
the
hill
above
it
,
and
are
like
the
shadows
of
giants
.
 
<EOS>
Also
,
I
see
that
they
are
covered
with
dust
,
and
that
the
dust
moves
with
them
as
they
come
,
tramp
,
tramp
!
 
<EOS>
But
when
they
advance
quite
near
to
me
,
I
recognise
the
tall
man
,
and
he
recognises
me
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
but
he
would
be
well
content
to
precipitate
himself
over
the
hill
-
side
once
again
,
as
on
the
evening
when
he
and
I
first
encountered
,
close
to
the
same
spot
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
described
it
as
if
he
were
there
,
and
it
was
evident
that
he
saw
it
vividly
;
perhaps
he
had
not
seen
much
in
his
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
show
the
soldiers
that
I
recognise
the
tall
man
;
he
does
not
show
the
soldiers
that
he
recognises
me
;
we
do
it
,
and
we
know
it
,
with
our
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
on
!
"
says
the
chief
of
that
company
,
pointing
to
the
village
,
"
bring
him
fast
to
his
tomb
!
"
<EOS>
and
they
bring
him
faster
.
<EOS>
I
follow
.
 
<EOS>
His
arms
are
swelled
because
of
being
bound
so
tight
,
his
wooden
shoes
are
large
and
clumsy
,
and
he
is
lame
.
 
<EOS>
Because
he
is
lame
,
and
consequently
slow
,
they
drive
him
with
their
guns
---
like
this
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
imitated
the
action
of
a
man
's
being
impelled
forward
by
the
butt
-
ends
of
muskets
.
   
<EOS>
"
As
they
descend
the
hill
like
madmen
running
a
race
,
he
falls
.
<EOS>
They
laugh
and
pick
him
up
again
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
is
bleeding
and
covered
with
dust
,
but
he
can
not
touch
it
;
thereupon
they
laugh
again
.
 
<EOS>
They
bring
him
into
the
village
;
all
the
village
runs
to
look
;
they
take
him
past
the
mill
,
and
up
to
the
prison
;
all
the
village
sees
the
prison
gate
open
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
,
and
swallow
him
---
like
this
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
opened
his
mouth
as
wide
as
he
could
,
and
shut
it
with
a
sounding
snap
of
his
teeth
.
 
<EOS>
Observant
of
his
unwillingness
to
mar
the
effect
by
opening
it
again
,
Defarge
said
,
"
Go
on
,
Jacques
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
the
village
,
"
pursued
the
mender
of
roads
,
on
tiptoe
and
in
a
low
voice
,
"
withdraws
;
all
the
village
whispers
by
the
fountain
;
all
the
village
sleeps
;
all
the
village
dreams
of
that
unhappy
one
,
within
the
locks
and
bars
of
the
prison
on
the
crag
,
and
never
to
come
out
of
it
,
except
to
perish
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
morning
,
with
my
tools
upon
my
shoulder
,
eating
my
morsel
of
black
bread
as
I
go
,
I
make
a
circuit
by
the
prison
,
on
my
way
to
my
work
.
 
<EOS>
There
I
see
him
,
high
up
,
behind
the
bars
of
a
lofty
iron
cage
,
bloody
and
dusty
as
last
night
,
looking
through
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
no
hand
free
,
to
wave
to
me
;
I
dare
not
call
to
him
;
he
regards
me
like
a
dead
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
Defarge
and
the
three
glanced
darkly
at
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
The
looks
of
all
of
them
were
dark
,
repressed
,
and
revengeful
,
as
they
listened
to
the
countryman
's
story
;
the
manner
of
all
of
them
,
while
it
was
secret
,
was
authoritative
too
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
the
air
of
a
rough
tribunal
;
Jacques
One
and
Two
sitting
on
the
old
pallet
-
bed
,
each
with
his
chin
resting
on
his
hand
,
and
his
eyes
intent
on
the
road
-
mender
;
Jacques
Three
,
equally
intent
,
on
one
knee
behind
them
,
with
his
agitated
hand
always
gliding
over
the
network
of
fine
nerves
about
his
mouth
and
nose
;
Defarge
standing
between
them
and
the
narrator
,
whom
he
had
stationed
in
the
light
of
the
window
,
by
turns
looking
from
him
to
them
,
and
from
them
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
Jacques
,
"
said
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
remains
up
there
in
his
iron
cage
some
days
.
 
<EOS>
The
village
looks
at
him
by
stealth
,
for
it
is
afraid
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
always
looks
up
,
from
a
distance
,
at
the
prison
on
the
crag
;
and
in
the
evening
,
when
the
work
of
the
day
is
achieved
and
it
assembles
to
gossip
at
the
fountain
,
all
faces
are
turned
towards
the
prison
.
 
<EOS>
Formerly
,
they
were
turned
towards
the
posting
-
house
;
now
,
they
are
turned
towards
the
prison
.
<EOS>
They
whisper
at
the
fountain
,
that
although
condemned
to
death
he
will
not
be
executed
;
they
say
that
petitions
have
been
presented
in
Paris
,
showing
that
he
was
enraged
and
made
mad
by
the
death
of
his
child
;
they
say
that
a
petition
has
been
presented
to
the
King
himself
.
<EOS>
What
do
I
know
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
yes
,
perhaps
no
.
"
   
"
Listen
then
,
Jacques
,
"
Number
One
of
that
name
sternly
interposed
.
"
<EOS>
Know
that
a
petition
was
presented
to
the
King
and
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
All
here
,
yourself
excepted
,
saw
the
King
take
it
,
in
his
carriage
in
the
street
,
sitting
beside
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
Defarge
whom
you
see
here
,
who
,
at
the
hazard
of
his
life
,
darted
out
before
the
horses
,
with
the
petition
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
once
again
listen
,
Jacques
!
"
said
the
kneeling
Number
Three
:
<EOS>
his
fingers
ever
wandering
over
and
over
those
fine
nerves
,
with
a
strikingly
greedy
air
,
as
if
he
hungered
for
something
---
that
was
neither
food
nor
drink
;
"
the
guard
,
horse
and
foot
,
surrounded
the
petitioner
,
and
struck
him
blows
.
 
<EOS>
You
hear
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hear
,
messieurs
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Go
on
then
,
"
said
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
"
Again
;
on
the
other
hand
,
they
whisper
at
the
fountain
,
"
resumed
the
countryman
,
"
that
he
is
brought
down
into
our
country
to
be
executed
on
the
spot
,
and
that
he
will
very
certainly
be
executed
.
 
<EOS>
They
even
whisper
that
because
he
has
slain
Monseigneur
,
and
because
Monseigneur
was
the
father
of
his
tenants
---
serfs
---
what
you
will
---
he
will
be
executed
as
a
parricide
.
 
<EOS>
One
old
man
says
at
the
fountain
,
that
his
right
hand
,
armed
with
the
knife
,
will
be
burnt
off
before
his
face
;
that
,
into
wounds
which
will
be
made
in
his
arms
,
his
breast
,
and
his
legs
,
there
will
be
poured
boiling
oil
,
melted
lead
,
hot
resin
,
wax
,
and
sulphur
;
finally
,
that
he
will
be
torn
limb
from
limb
by
four
strong
horses
.
 
<EOS>
That
old
man
says
,
all
this
was
actually
done
to
a
prisoner
who
made
an
attempt
on
the
life
of
the
late
King
,
Louis
Fifteen
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
do
I
know
if
he
lies
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
scholar
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Listen
once
again
then
,
Jacques
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
man
with
the
restless
hand
and
the
craving
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
name
of
that
prisoner
was
Damiens
,
and
it
was
all
done
in
open
day
,
in
the
open
streets
of
this
city
of
Paris
;
and
nothing
was
more
noticed
in
the
vast
concourse
that
saw
it
done
,
than
the
crowd
of
ladies
of
quality
and
fashion
,
who
were
full
of
eager
attention
to
the
last
---
to
the
last
,
Jacques
,
prolonged
until
nightfall
,
when
he
had
lost
two
legs
and
an
arm
,
and
still
breathed
!
 
<EOS>
And
it
was
done
<EOS>
---
why
,
how
old
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thirty
-
five
,
"
said
the
mender
of
roads
,
who
looked
sixty
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
done
when
you
were
more
than
ten
years
old
;
you
might
have
seen
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Enough
!
"
said
Defarge
,
with
grim
impatience
.
 
<EOS>
"
Long
live
the
Devil
!
<EOS>
Go
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
Some
whisper
this
,
some
whisper
that
;
they
speak
of
nothing
else
;
even
the
fountain
appears
to
fall
to
that
tune
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
on
Sunday
night
when
all
the
village
is
asleep
,
come
soldiers
,
winding
down
from
the
prison
,
and
their
guns
ring
on
the
stones
of
the
little
street
.
<EOS>
Workmen
dig
,
workmen
hammer
,
soldiers
laugh
and
sing
;
in
the
morning
,
by
the
fountain
,
there
is
raised
a
gallows
forty
feet
high
,
poisoning
the
water
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
mender
of
roads
looked
THROUGH
rather
than
AT
the
low
ceiling
,
and
pointed
as
if
he
saw
the
gallows
somewhere
in
the
sky
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
work
is
stopped
,
all
assemble
there
,
nobody
leads
the
cows
out
,
the
cows
are
there
with
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
At
midday
,
the
roll
of
drums
.
<EOS>
Soldiers
have
marched
into
the
prison
in
the
night
,
and
he
is
in
the
midst
of
many
soldiers
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
bound
as
before
,
and
in
his
mouth
there
is
a
gag
---
<EOS>
tied
so
,
with
a
tight
string
,
making
him
look
almost
as
if
he
laughed
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
suggested
it
,
by
creasing
his
face
with
his
two
thumbs
,
from
the
corners
of
his
mouth
to
his
ears
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
the
top
of
the
gallows
is
fixed
the
knife
,
blade
upwards
,
with
its
point
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
hanged
there
forty
feet
high
---
and
is
left
hanging
,
poisoning
the
water
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
looked
at
one
another
,
as
he
used
his
blue
cap
to
wipe
his
face
,
on
which
the
perspiration
had
started
afresh
while
he
recalled
the
spectacle
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
frightful
,
messieurs
.
 
<EOS>
How
can
the
women
and
the
children
draw
water
!
 
<EOS>
Who
can
gossip
of
an
evening
,
under
that
shadow
!
 
<EOS>
Under
it
,
have
I
said
?
 
<EOS>
When
I
left
the
village
,
Monday
evening
as
the
sun
was
going
to
bed
,
and
looked
back
from
the
hill
,
the
shadow
struck
across
the
church
,
across
the
mill
,
across
the
prison
---
seemed
to
strike
across
the
earth
,
messieurs
,
to
where
the
sky
rests
upon
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
hungry
man
gnawed
one
of
his
fingers
as
he
looked
at
the
other
three
,
and
his
finger
quivered
with
the
craving
that
was
on
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
,
messieurs
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
at
sunset
(
as
I
had
been
warned
to
do
)
,
and
I
walked
on
,
that
night
and
half
next
day
,
until
I
met
(
as
I
was
warned
I
should
)
<EOS>
this
comrade
.
 
<EOS>
With
him
,
I
came
on
,
now
riding
and
now
walking
,
through
the
rest
of
yesterday
and
through
last
night
.
<EOS>
And
here
you
see
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
gloomy
silence
,
the
first
Jacques
said
,
"
Good
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
acted
and
recounted
faithfully
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
wait
for
us
a
little
,
outside
the
door
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
willingly
,
"
said
the
mender
of
roads
.
 
<EOS>
Whom
Defarge
escorted
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
,
and
,
leaving
seated
there
,
returned
.
   
<EOS>
The
three
had
risen
,
and
their
heads
were
together
when
he
came
back
to
the
garret
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
say
you
,
Jacques
?
"
demanded
Number
One
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
registered
?
"
   
"
To
be
registered
,
as
doomed
to
destruction
,
"
returned
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
"
Magnificent
!
"
croaked
the
man
with
the
craving
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
chateau
,
and
all
the
race
?
"
inquired
the
first
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
chateau
and
all
the
race
,
"
returned
Defarge
.
 
<EOS>
"
Extermination
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
hungry
man
repeated
,
in
a
rapturous
croak
,
"
Magnificent
!
"
and
began
gnawing
another
finger
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
,
"
asked
Jacques
Two
,
of
Defarge
,
"
that
no
embarrassment
can
arise
from
our
manner
of
keeping
the
register
?
 
<EOS>
Without
doubt
it
is
safe
,
for
no
one
beyond
ourselves
can
decipher
it
;
but
shall
we
always
be
able
to
decipher
it
---
or
,
I
ought
to
say
,
will
she
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Jacques
,
"
returned
Defarge
,
drawing
himself
up
,
"
if
madame
my
wife
undertook
to
keep
the
register
in
her
memory
alone
,
she
would
not
lose
a
word
of
it
---
not
a
syllable
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Knitted
,
in
her
own
stitches
and
her
own
symbols
,
it
will
always
be
as
plain
to
her
as
the
sun
.
<EOS>
Confide
in
Madame
Defarge
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
easier
for
the
weakest
poltroon
that
lives
,
to
erase
himself
from
existence
,
than
to
erase
one
letter
of
his
name
or
crimes
from
the
knitted
register
of
Madame
Defarge
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
murmur
of
confidence
and
approval
,
and
then
the
man
who
hungered
,
asked
:
 
"
Is
this
rustic
to
be
sent
back
soon
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
so
.
<EOS>
He
is
very
simple
;
is
he
not
a
little
dangerous
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
knows
nothing
,
"
said
Defarge
;
"
at
least
nothing
more
than
would
easily
elevate
himself
to
a
gallows
of
the
same
height
.
 
<EOS>
I
charge
myself
with
him
;
let
him
remain
with
me
;
I
will
take
care
of
him
,
and
set
him
on
his
road
.
 
<EOS>
He
wishes
to
see
the
fine
world
---
the
King
,
the
Queen
,
and
Court
;
let
him
see
them
on
Sunday
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
exclaimed
the
hungry
man
,
staring
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
a
good
sign
,
that
he
wishes
to
see
Royalty
and
Nobility
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Jacques
,
"
said
Defarge
;
"
judiciously
show
a
cat
milk
,
if
you
wish
her
to
thirst
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Judiciously
show
a
dog
his
natural
prey
,
if
you
wish
him
to
bring
it
down
one
day
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nothing
more
was
said
,
and
the
mender
of
roads
,
being
found
already
dozing
on
the
topmost
stair
,
was
advised
to
lay
himself
down
on
the
pallet
-
bed
and
take
some
rest
.
 
<EOS>
He
needed
no
persuasion
,
and
was
soon
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
Worse
quarters
than
Defarge
's
wine
-
shop
,
could
easily
have
been
found
in
Paris
for
a
provincial
slave
of
that
degree
.
 
<EOS>
Saving
for
a
mysterious
dread
of
madame
by
which
he
was
constantly
haunted
,
his
life
was
very
new
and
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
madame
sat
all
day
at
her
counter
,
so
expressly
unconscious
of
him
,
and
so
particularly
determined
not
to
perceive
that
his
being
there
had
any
connection
with
anything
below
the
surface
,
that
he
shook
in
his
wooden
shoes
whenever
his
eye
lighted
on
her
.
<EOS>
For
,
he
contended
with
himself
that
it
was
impossible
to
foresee
what
that
lady
might
pretend
next
;
and
he
felt
assured
that
if
she
should
take
it
into
her
brightly
ornamented
head
to
pretend
that
she
had
seen
him
do
a
murder
and
afterwards
flay
the
victim
,
she
would
infallibly
go
through
with
it
until
the
play
was
played
out
.
   
<EOS>
Therefore
,
when
Sunday
came
,
the
mender
of
roads
was
not
enchanted
(
though
he
said
he
was
)
to
find
that
madame
was
to
accompany
monsieur
and
himself
to
Versailles
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
additionally
disconcerting
to
have
madame
knitting
all
the
way
there
,
in
a
public
conveyance
;
it
was
additionally
disconcerting
yet
,
to
have
madame
in
the
crowd
in
the
afternoon
,
still
with
her
knitting
in
her
hands
as
the
crowd
waited
to
see
the
carriage
of
the
King
and
Queen
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
work
hard
,
madame
,
"
said
a
man
near
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
answered
Madame
Defarge
;
"
I
have
a
good
deal
to
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
make
,
madame
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Many
things
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
instance
---
"
   
"
For
instance
,
"
returned
Madame
Defarge
,
composedly
,
"
shrouds
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
man
moved
a
little
further
away
,
as
soon
as
he
could
,
and
the
mender
of
roads
fanned
himself
with
his
blue
cap
:
 
<EOS>
feeling
it
mightily
close
and
oppressive
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
needed
a
King
and
Queen
to
restore
him
,
he
was
fortunate
in
having
his
remedy
at
hand
;
for
,
soon
the
large
-
faced
King
and
the
fair
-
faced
Queen
came
in
their
golden
coach
,
attended
by
the
shining
Bull
's
Eye
of
their
Court
,
a
glittering
multitude
of
laughing
ladies
and
fine
lords
;
and
in
jewels
and
silks
and
powder
and
splendour
and
elegantly
spurning
figures
and
handsomely
disdainful
faces
of
both
sexes
,
the
mender
of
roads
bathed
himself
,
so
much
to
his
temporary
intoxication
,
that
he
cried
<EOS>
Long
live
the
King
<EOS>
,
Long
live
the
Queen
,
Long
live
everybody
and
everything
!
<EOS>
as
if
he
had
never
heard
of
ubiquitous
Jacques
in
his
time
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
there
were
gardens
,
courtyards
,
terraces
,
fountains
,
green
banks
,
more
King
and
Queen
,
more
Bull
's
Eye
,
more
lords
and
ladies
,
more
Long
live
they
all
!
<EOS>
until
he
absolutely
wept
with
sentiment
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
whole
of
this
scene
,
which
lasted
some
three
hours
,
he
had
plenty
of
shouting
and
weeping
and
sentimental
company
,
and
throughout
Defarge
held
him
by
the
collar
,
as
if
to
restrain
him
from
flying
at
the
objects
of
his
brief
devotion
and
tearing
them
to
pieces
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bravo
!
<EOS>
"
said
Defarge
,
clapping
him
on
the
back
when
it
was
over
,
like
a
patron
;
"
you
are
a
good
boy
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
mender
of
roads
was
now
coming
to
himself
,
and
was
mistrustful
of
having
made
a
mistake
in
his
late
demonstrations
;
but
no
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
fellow
we
want
,
"
said
Defarge
,
in
his
ear
;
"
you
make
these
fools
believe
that
it
will
last
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
they
are
the
more
insolent
,
and
it
is
the
nearer
ended
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hey
!
"
cried
the
mender
of
roads
,
reflectively
;
"
that
's
true
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
These
fools
know
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
While
they
despise
your
breath
,
and
would
stop
it
for
ever
and
ever
,
in
you
or
<EOS>
in
a
hundred
like
you
rather
than
in
one
of
their
own
horses
or
dogs
,
they
only
know
what
your
breath
tells
them
.
 
<EOS>
Let
it
deceive
them
,
then
,
a
little
longer
;
it
can
not
deceive
them
too
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
looked
superciliously
at
the
client
,
and
nodded
in
confirmation
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
you
,
"
said
she
,
"
you
would
shout
and
shed
tears
for
anything
,
if
it
made
a
show
and
a
noise
.
 
<EOS>
Say
!
 
<EOS>
Would
you
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
madame
,
I
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
For

If
you
were
shown
a
great
heap
of
dolls
,
and
were
set
upon
them
to
pluck
them
to
pieces
and
despoil
them
for

you
would
pick
out
the

Would

Truly
yes

Yes

And
if
you
were

a

unable
to
fly

were
set
upon

to
strip
them

You

said
Madame

with
a

of

towards

Still
Knitting
 
Madame
Defarge
and
monsieur
her
husband
returned
amicably
to
the
bosom
of
Saint
Antoine
,
while
a
speck
in
a
blue
cap
toiled
through
the
darkness
,
and
through
the
dust
,
and
down
the
weary
miles
of
avenue
by
the
wayside
,
slowly
tending
towards
that
point
of
the
compass
where
the
chateau
of
Monsieur
the
Marquis
,
now
in
his
grave
,
listened
to
the
whispering
trees
.
 
<EOS>
Such
ample
leisure
had
the
stone
faces
,
now
,
for
listening
to
the
trees
and
to
the
fountain
,
that
the
few
village
scarecrows
who
,
in
their
quest
for
herbs
to
eat
and
fragments
of
dead
stick
to
burn
,
strayed
within
sight
of
the
great
stone
courtyard
and
terrace
staircase
,
had
it
borne
in
upon
their
starved
fancy
that
the
expression
of
the
faces
was
altered
.
 
<EOS>
A
rumour
just
lived
in
the
village
---
had
a
faint
and
bare
existence
there
,
as
its
people
had
---
that
when
the
knife
struck
home
,
the
faces
changed
,
from
faces
of
pride
to
faces
of
anger
and
pain
;
also
,
that
when
that
dangling
figure
was
hauled
up
forty
feet
above
the
fountain
,
they
changed
again
,
and
bore
a
cruel
look
of
being
avenged
,
which
they
would
henceforth
bear
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
stone
face
over
the
great
window
of
the
bed
-
chamber
where
the
murder
was
done
,
two
fine
dints
were
pointed
out
in
the
sculptured
nose
,
which
everybody
recognised
,
and
which
nobody
had
seen
of
old
;
and
on
the
scarce
occasions
when
two
or
three
ragged
peasants
emerged
from
the
crowd
to
take
a
hurried
peep
at
Monsieur
the
Marquis
petrified
,
a
skinny
finger
would
not
have
pointed
to
it
for
a
minute
,
before
they
all
started
away
among
the
moss
and
leaves
,
like
the
more
fortunate
hares
who
could
find
a
living
there
.
   
<EOS>
Chateau
and
hut
,
stone
face
and
dangling
figure
,
the
red
stain
on
the
stone
floor
,
and
the
pure
water
in
the
village
<EOS>
well
---
thousands
of
acres
of
land
---
a
whole
province
of
France
---
all
France
itself
---
lay
under
the
night
sky
,
concentrated
into
a
faint
hair
-
breadth
line
.
 
<EOS>
So
does
a
whole
world
,
with
all
its
greatnesses
and
littlenesses
,
lie
in
a
twinkling
star
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
mere
human
knowledge
can
split
a
ray
of
light
and
analyse
the
manner
of
its
composition
,
so
,
sublimer
intelligences
may
read
in
the
feeble
shining
of
this
earth
of
ours
,
every
thought
and
act
,
every
vice
and
virtue
,
of
every
responsible
creature
on
it
.
   
<EOS>
The
Defarges
,
husband
and
wife
,
came
lumbering
under
the
starlight
,
<EOS>
in
their
public
vehicle
,
to
that
gate
of
Paris
whereunto
their
journey
naturally
tended
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
usual
stoppage
at
the
barrier
guardhouse
,
and
the
usual
lanterns
came
glancing
forth
for
the
usual
examination
and
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
Defarge
alighted
;
knowing
one
or
two
of
the
soldiery
there
,
and
one
of
the
police
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
<EOS>
he
was
intimate
with
,
and
affectionately
embraced
.
   
<EOS>
When
Saint
Antoine
had
again
enfolded
the
Defarges
in
his
dusky
wings
,
and
they
,
having
finally
alighted
near
the
Saint
's
boundaries
,
were
picking
their
way
on
foot
through
the
black
mud
and
offal
of
his
streets
,
Madame
Defarge
spoke
to
her
husband
:
   
"
<EOS>
Say
then
,
my
friend
;
what
did
Jacques
of
the
police
tell
thee
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
little
to
-
night
,
but
all
he
knows
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
another
spy
commissioned
for
our
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
There
may
be
many
more
,
for
all
that
he
can
say
,
but
he
knows
of
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Eh
well
!
"
said
Madame
Defarge
,
raising
her
eyebrows
with
a
cool
business
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
necessary
to
register
him
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
they
call
that
man
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
English
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Barsad
,
"
said
Defarge
,
making
it
French
by
pronunciation
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
he
had
been
so
careful
to
get
it
accurately
,
that
he
then
spelt
it
with
perfect
correctness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Barsad
,
"
repeated
madame
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good

"
   
<EOS>
"
John

"

"
John

repeated
madame
,
after
murmuring
it
once
to
herself
.
"
<EOS>
Good
.
 
<EOS>
His
appearance
;
is
it
known

"
   
<EOS>
"
Age

about
forty

about

complexion
dark

generally
,
rather
handsome
visage
;
<EOS>
eyes
dark
,
face
thin
,
long
,
and
sallow
;
nose
aquiline
,
but
not
straight
,
having
a
peculiar
inclination
towards
the
left
cheek
;
expression
,
therefore
,
sinister
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Eh
<EOS>
my
faith
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
portrait
!
"
<EOS>
said
madame
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
shall
be
registered
to
-
morrow
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
turned
into
the
wine
-
shop
,
which
was
closed
(
for
it
was
midnight
)
,
and
where
Madame
Defarge
immediately
took
her
post
at
her
desk
,
counted
the
small
moneys
that
had
been
taken
during
her
absence
,
examined
the
stock
,
went
through
the
entries
in
the
book
,
made
other
entries
of
her
own
,
checked
the
serving
man
in
every
possible
way
,
and
finally
dismissed
him
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
turned
out
the
contents
of
the
bowl
of
money
for
the
second
time
,
and
began
knotting
them
up
in
her
handkerchief
,
in
a
chain
of
separate
knots
,
for
safe
keeping
through
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
while
,
Defarge
,
with
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
,
walked
up
and
down
,
complacently
admiring
,
but
never
interfering
;
in
which
condition
,
indeed
,
as
to
the
business
and
his
domestic
affairs
,
he
walked
up
and
down
through
life
.
   
<EOS>
The
night
was
hot
,
and
the
shop
,
close
shut
and
surrounded
by
so
foul
a
neighbourhood
,
was
ill
-
smelling
.
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
Defarge
's
olfactory
sense
was
by
no
means
delicate
,
but
the
stock
of
wine
smelt
much
stronger
than
it
ever
tasted
,
and
so
did
the
stock
of
rum
and
brandy
and
aniseed
.
 
<EOS>
He
whiffed
the
compound
of
scents
away
,
as
he
put
down
his
smoked
-
out
pipe
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
fatigued
,
"
said
madame
,
raising
her
glance
as
she
knotted
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
are
only
the
usual
odours
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
little
tired
,
"
her
husband
acknowledged
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
little
depressed
,
too
,
"
said
madame
,
whose
quick
eyes
had
never
been
so
intent
on
the
accounts
,
but
they
had
had
a
ray
or
two
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
the
men
,
the
men
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
my
dear
!
"
began
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
madame
,
nodding
firmly
;
"
but
my
dear
!
<EOS>
You
are
faint
of
heart
to
-
night
,
my
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
said
Defarge
,
<EOS>
as
if
a
thought
were
wrung
out
of
his
breast
,
"
it
IS
a
long
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
long
time
,
"
repeated
his
wife
;
"
and
when
is
it
not
a
long
time
?
<EOS>
Vengeance
and
retribution
require
a
long
time
;
it
is
the
rule
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
does
not
take
a
long
time
to
strike
a
man
with
Lightning
,
"
said
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
long
,
"
demanded
madame
,
composedly
,
"
does
it
take
to
make
and
store
the
lightning
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Defarge
raised
his
head
thoughtfully
,
as
if
there
were
something
in
that
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
does
not
take
a
long
time
,
"
said
madame
,
"
for
an
earthquake
to
swallow
a
town
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
well
!
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
how
long
it
takes
to
prepare
the
earthquake
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
long
time
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
when
it
is
ready
,
it
takes
place
,
and
grinds
to
pieces
everything
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
it
is
always
preparing
,
though
it
is
not
seen
or
heard
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
your
consolation
.
 
<EOS>
Keep
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
tied
a
knot
with
flashing
eyes
,
as
if
it
throttled
a
foe
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
thee
,
"
said
madame
,
extending
her
right
hand
,
for
emphasis
,
"
that
although
it
is
a
long
time
on
the
road
,
it
is
on
the
road
and
coming
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
thee
it
never
retreats
,
and
never
stops
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
thee
it
is
always
advancing
.
 
<EOS>
Look
around
and
consider
the
Eves
of
all
the
world
that
we
know
,
consider
the
faces
of
all
the
world
that
we
know
,
consider
the
rage
and
discontent
to
which
the
Jacquerie
addresses
itself
with
more
and
more
of
certainty
every
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Can
such
things
last
?
<EOS>
Bah
!
 
<EOS>
I
mock
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
brave
wife
,
"
returned
Defarge
,
standing
before
her
with
his
head
a
little
bent
,
and
his
hands
clasped
at
his
back
,
like
a
docile
and
attentive
pupil
before
his
catechist
,
"
I
do
not
question
all
this
.
<EOS>
But
it
has
lasted
a
long
time
,
and
it
is
possible
---
you
know
<EOS>
well
,
my
wife
,
it
is
possible
---
that
it
may
not
come
,
during
our
lives
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Eh
well
!
 
<EOS>
How
then
?
"
demanded
madame
,
tying
another
knot
,
as
if
there
were
another
enemy
strangled
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Defarge
,
with
a
half
complaining
and
half
apologetic
shrug
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
see
the
triumph
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
helped
it
,
"
returned
madame
,
with
her
extended
hand
in
strong
action
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
that
we
do
,
is
done
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
with
all
my
soul
,
that
we
shall
see
the
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
But
even
if
not
,
even
if
I
knew
certainly
not
,
show
me
the
neck
of
an
aristocrat
and
tyrant
,
and
still
I
would
<EOS>
---
"
   
Then
madame
,
with
her
teeth
set
,
tied
a
very
terrible
knot
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Defarge
,
reddening
a
little
as
if
he
felt
charged
with
cowardice
;
"
I
too
,
my
dear
,
will
stop
at
nothing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
your
weakness
that
you
sometimes
need
to
see
your
victim
and
your
opportunity
,
to
sustain
you
.
 
<EOS>
Sustain
yourself
without
that
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
time
comes
,
let
loose
a
tiger
and
a
devil
;
but
wait
for
the
time
with
the
tiger
and
the
devil
chained
---
not
shown
---
yet
always
ready
.
"
   
<EOS>
Madame
enforced
the
conclusion
of
this
piece
of
advice
by
striking
her
little
counter
with
her
chain
of
money
as
if
she
knocked
its
brains
out
,
and
then
gathering
the
heavy
handkerchief
under
her
arm
in
a
serene
manner
,
and
observing
that
it
was
time
to
go
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
Next
noontide
saw
the
admirable
woman
in
her
usual
place
in
the
wine
-
shop
,
knitting
away
assiduously
.
 
<EOS>
A
rose
lay
beside
her
,
and
if
she
now
and
then
glanced
at
the
flower
,
it
was
with
no
infraction
of
her
usual
preoccupied
air
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
a
few
customers
,
drinking
or
not
drinking
,
standing
or
seated
,
sprinkled
about
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
was
very
hot
,
and
heaps
of
flies
,
who
were
extending
their
inquisitive
and
adventurous
perquisitions
into
all
the
glutinous
little
glasses
near
madame
,
fell
dead
at
the
bottom
.
 
<EOS>
Their
decease
made
no
impression
on
the
other
flies
out
promenading
,
who
looked
at
them
in
the
coolest
manner
(
as
if
they
themselves
were
elephants
,
or
something
as
far
removed
)
,
until
they
met
the
same
fate
.
 
<EOS>
Curious
to
consider
how
heedless
flies
are
!
<EOS>
---
perhaps
they
thought
as
much
at
Court
that
sunny
summer
day
.
   
<EOS>
A
figure
entering
at
the
door
threw
a
shadow
on
Madame
Defarge
which
she
felt
to
be
a
new
one
.
 
<EOS>
She
laid
down
her
knitting
,
and
began
to
pin
her
rose
in
her
head
-
dress
,
before
she
looked
at
the
figure
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
curious
.
 
<EOS>
The
moment
Madame
Defarge
took
up
the
rose
,
the
customers
ceased
talking
,
and
began
gradually
to
drop
out
of
the
wine
-
shop
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
day
,
madame
,
"
said
the
new
-
comer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
day
,
monsieur
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
said
it
aloud
,
but
added
to
herself
,
as
she
resumed
her
knitting
:
"
<EOS>
Hah
!
 
<EOS>
Good
day
,
age
about
forty

Good

one

"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
the
goodness
to
give
me
a
little
glass
of
old
cognac
,
and
a
mouthful
of
cool
fresh
water
,
madame

"
   
<EOS>
Madame
complied
with
a
polite
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
Marvellous
cognac
this
,
madame
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
it
had
ever
been
so
complemented
,
and
Madame
Defarge
knew
enough
of
its
antecedents
to
know
better
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
however
,
that
the
cognac
was
flattered
,
and
took
up
her
knitting
.
<EOS>
The
visitor
watched
her
fingers
for
a
few
moments
,
and
took
the
opportunity
of
observing
the
place
in
general
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
knit
with
great
skill
,
madame
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
accustomed
to
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
pretty
pattern
too
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
YOU
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
said
madame
,
looking
at
him
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
Decidedly
.
 
<EOS>
May
one
ask
what
it
is
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pastime
,
"
said
madame
,
still
looking
at
him
with
a
smile
while
her
fingers
moved
nimbly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
for
use
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
depends
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
find
a
use
for
it
one
day
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
do
---
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
madame
,
drawing
a
breath
and
nodding
her
head
with
a
stem
kind
of
coquetry
,
"
I
'll
use
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
remarkable
;
but
,
the
taste
of
Saint
Antoine
seemed
to
be
decidedly
opposed
to
a
rose
on
the
head
-
dress
of
Madame
Defarge
.
<EOS>
Two
men
had
entered
separately
,
and
had
been
about
to
order
drink
,
when
,
catching
sight
of
that
novelty
,
they
faltered
,
made
a
pretence
of
looking
about
as
if
for
some
friend
who
was
not
there
,
and
went
away
.
<EOS>
Nor
,
of
those
who
had
been
there
when
this
visitor
entered
,
was
there
one
left
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
all
dropped
off
.
 
<EOS>
The
spy
had
kept
his
eyes
open
,
but
had
been
able
to
detect
no
sign
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
lounged
away
in
a
poverty
-
stricken
,
purposeless
,
accidental
manner
,
quite
natural
and
unimpeachable
.
   
<EOS>
"
JOHN
,
"
thought
madame
,
checking
off
her
work
as
her
fingers
knitted
,
and
her
eyes
looked
at
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
long
enough
,
and
I
shall
knit

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
"
I

Children

<EOS>
"
No

"
Business
seems
bad

"
   
<EOS>
"
Business
is
very
bad
;
the
people
are
so
poor
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
the
unfortunate
,
miserable
people
!
 
<EOS>
So
oppressed
,
too
---
as
you
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
YOU
say
,
"
madame
retorted
,
correcting
him
,
and
deftly
knitting
an
extra
something
into
his
name
that
boded
him
no
good
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
;
certainly
it
was
I
who
said
so
,
but
you
naturally
think
so
.
<EOS>
Of
course
.
"
   
"
\I\
think
?
<EOS>
"
returned
madame
,
in
a
high
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
and
my
husband
have
enough
to
do
to
keep
this
wine
-
shop
open
,
without
thinking
.
 
<EOS>
All
we
think
,
here
,
is
how
to
live
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
the
subject
WE
think
of
,
and
it
gives
us
,
from
morning
to
night
,
enough
to
think
about
,
without
embarrassing
our
heads
concerning
others
.
 
<EOS>
\I\
think
for
others

<EOS>
No

no

"
   
<EOS>
The
spy
,
who
was
there
to
pick
up
any
crumbs
he
could
find
or
make
,
did
not
allow
his
baffled
state
to
express
itself
in
his
sinister
face
;
but
,
stood
with
an
air
of
gossiping
gallantry
,
leaning
his
elbow
on
Madame
Defarge
's
little
counter
,
and
occasionally
sipping
his
cognac
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
bad
business
this
,
madame
,
of
Gaspard
's
execution
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
the
poor
Gaspard
!
"
 
<EOS>
With
a
sigh
of
great
compassion
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
faith
!
"
returned
madame
,
coolly
and
lightly
,
"
<EOS>
if
people
use
knives
for
such
purposes
,
they
have
to
pay
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
beforehand
what
the
price
of
his
luxury
was
;
he
has
paid
the
price
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
"
said
the
spy
,
dropping
his
soft
voice
to
a
tone
that
invited
confidence
,
and
expressing
an
injured
revolutionary
susceptibility
in
every
muscle
of
his
wicked
face
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
there
is
much
compassion
and
anger
in
this
neighbourhood
,
touching
the
poor
fellow
?
 
<EOS>
Between
ourselves
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
?
"
<EOS>
asked
madame
,
vacantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
not
?
"
   
"
---
Here
is
my
husband
!
"
said
Madame
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
keeper
of
the
wine
-
shop
entered
at
the
door
,
the
spy
saluted
him
by
touching
his
hat
,
and
saying
,
with
an
engaging
smile
,
"
Good
day
,
Jacques
!
"
 
<EOS>
Defarge
stopped
short
,
and
stared
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
day
,
Jacques
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
spy
repeated
;
with
not
quite
so
much
confidence
,
or
quite
so
easy
a
smile
under
the
stare
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
deceive
yourself
,
monsieur
,
"
returned
the
keeper
of
the
wine
-
shop
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
mistake
me
for
another
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
not
my
name
.
<EOS>
I
am
Ernest
Defarge
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
the
same
,
"
said
the
spy
,
airily
,
but
discomfited
too
:
"
good
day
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
day
!
<EOS>
"
answered
Defarge
,
drily
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
saying
to
madame
,
with
whom
I
had
the
pleasure
of
chatting
when
you
entered
<EOS>
,
that
they
tell
me
there
is
---
and
no
wonder
!
<EOS>
---
much
sympathy
and
anger
in
Saint
Antoine
,
touching
the
unhappy
fate
of
poor
Gaspard
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
one
has
told
me
so
,
"
said
Defarge
,
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Having
said
it
,
he
passed
behind
the
little
counter
,
and
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
back
of
his
wife
's
chair
,
looking
over
that
barrier
at
the
person
to
whom
they
were
both
opposed
,
and
whom
either
of
them
would
have
shot
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
The
spy
,
well
used
to
his
business
,
did
not
change
his
unconscious
attitude
,
but
drained
his
little
glass
of
cognac
,
took
a
sip
of
fresh
water
,
and
asked
for
another
glass
of
cognac
.
 
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
poured
it
out
for
him
,
took
to
her
knitting
again
,
and
hummed
a
little
song
over
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
know
this
quarter
well
;
that
is
to
say
,
better
than
I
do
?
"
observed
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
<EOS>
,
<EOS>
but
I
hope
to
know
it
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
profoundly
interested
in
its
miserable
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hah
!
"
muttered
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
pleasure
of
conversing
with
you
,
Monsieur
Defarge
,
recalls
to
me
,
"
pursued
the
spy
,
"
that
I
have
the
honour
of
cherishing
some
interesting
associations
with
your
name
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
"
said
Defarge
,
with
much
indifference
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
When
Doctor
Manette
was
released
,
you
,
his
old
domestic
,
had
the
charge
of
him
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
delivered
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
I
am
informed
of
the
circumstances
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Such
is
the
fact
,
certainly
,
"
said
Defarge
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
had
it
conveyed
to
him
,
in
an
accidental
touch
of
his
wife
's
elbow
as
she
knitted
and
warbled
,
that
he
would
do
best
to
answer
,
but
always
with
brevity
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
to
you
,
"
said
the
spy
,
"
that
his
daughter
came
;
and
it
was
from
your
care
that
his
daughter
took
him
,
accompanied
by
a
neat
brown
monsieur
;
how
is
he
called
?
<EOS>
---
in
a
little
wig
---
Lorry
---
of
the
bank
of
Tellson
and
Company
---
over
to
England
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Such
is
the
fact
,
"
repeated
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
interesting
remembrances
!
"
said
the
spy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
known
Doctor
Manette
and
his
daughter
,
in
England
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
?
"
said
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
hear
much
about
them
now
?
"
said
the
spy
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
effect
,
"
madame
struck
in
,
looking
up
from
her
work
and
her
little
song
,
"
we
never
hear
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
We
received
the
news
of
their
safe
arrival
,
and
perhaps
another
letter
,
or
perhaps
two
;
but
,
since
then
,
they
have
gradually
taken
their
road
in
life
---
we
,
ours
---
and
we
have
held
no
correspondence
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Perfectly
so
,
madame
,
"
replied
the
spy
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
going
to
be
married
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Going
?
<EOS>
"
echoed
madame
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
was
pretty
enough
to
have
been
married
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
You
English
are
cold
,
it
seems
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
I
am
English
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
perceive
your
tongue
is
,
"
returned
madame
;
"
and
what
the
tongue
is
,
I
suppose
the
man
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
did
not
take
the
identification
as
a
compliment
;
but
he
made
the
best
of
it
,
and
turned
it
off
with
a
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
After
sipping
his
cognac
to
the
end
,
he
added
:
   
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Miss
Manette
is
going
to
be
married
.
 
<EOS>
But
not
to
an
Englishman
;
to
one
who
,
like
herself
,
is
French
by
birth
.
 
<EOS>
And
speaking
of
Gaspard
(
ah
,
poor
Gaspard
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
cruel
,
cruel
!
)
,
it
is
a
curious
thing
that
she
is
going
to
marry
the
nephew
of
Monsieur
the
Marquis
,
for
whom
Gaspard
was
exalted
to
that
height
of
so
many
feet
;
in
other
words
,
the
present
Marquis
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
lives
unknown
in
England
<EOS>
,
he
is
no
Marquis
there
;
he
is
Mr
Charles
Darnay
.
 
<EOS>
D'Aulnais
is
the
name
of
his
mother
's
family
.
"
   
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
knitted
steadily
,
but
the
intelligence
had
a
palpable
effect
upon
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Do
what
he
would
,
behind
the
little
counter
,
as
to
the
striking
of
a
light
and
the
lighting
of
his
pipe
,
he
was
troubled
,
and
his
hand
was
not
trustworthy
.
 
<EOS>
The
spy
would
have
been
no
spy
if
he
had
failed
to
see
it
,
or
to
record
it
in
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
Having
made
,
at
least
,
this
one
hit
,
whatever
it
might
prove
to
be
worth
,
and
no
customers
coming
in
to
help
him
to
any
other
,
Mr
Barsad
paid
for
what
he
had
drunk
,
and
took
his
leave
:
 
taking
occasion
to
say
,
in
a
genteel
manner
,
before
he
departed
,
that
he
looked
forward
to
the
pleasure
of
seeing
Monsieur
and
Madame
Defarge
again
.
 
<EOS>
For
some
minutes
after
he
had
emerged
into
the
outer
presence
of
Saint
Antoine
,
the
husband
and
wife
remained
exactly
as
he
had
left
them
,
lest
he
should
come
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
it
be
true
,
"
said
Defarge
,
in
a
low
voice
,
looking
down
at
his
wife
as
he
stood
smoking
with
his
hand
on
the
back
of
her
chair
:
 
<EOS>
"
what
he
has
said
of
Ma'amselle
Manette
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
he
has
said
it
,
"
returned
madame
,
lifting
her
eyebrows
a
little
,
"
it
is
probably
false
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
may
be
true
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
is
---
"
Defarge
began
,
and
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
is
?
"
repeated
his
wife
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
And
if
it
does
come
,
while
we
live
to
see
it
triumph
---
I
hope
,
for
her
sake
,
Destiny
will
keep
her
husband
out
of
France
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Her
husband
's
destiny
,
"
said
Madame
Defarge
,
with
her
usual
composure
,
"
will
take
him
where
he
is
to
go
,
and
will
lead
him
to
the
end
that
is
to
end
him
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
all
I
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
very
strange
---
now
,
at
least
,
is
it
not
very
strange
"
---
said
Defarge
,
rather
pleading
with
his
wife
to
induce
her
to
admit
it
,
"
that
,
after
all
our
sympathy
for
Monsieur
her
father
,
and
herself
,
her
husband
's
name
should
be
proscribed
under
your
hand
at
this
moment
,
by
the
side
of
that
infernal
dog
's
who
has
just
left
us
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stranger
things
than
that
will
happen
when
it
does
come
,
"
answered
madame
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
them
both
here
,
of
a
certainty
;
and
they
are
both
here
for
their
merits
;
that
is
enough
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
roiled
up
her
knitting
when
she
had
said
those
words
,
and
presently
took
the
rose
out
of
the
handkerchief
that
was
wound
about
her
head
.
<EOS>
Either
Saint
Antoine
had
an
instinctive
sense
that
the
objectionable
decoration
was
gone
,
or
Saint
Antoine
was
on
the
watch
for
its
disappearance
;
howbeit
,
the
Saint
took
courage
to
lounge
in
,
very
shortly
afterwards
,
and
the
wine
-
shop
recovered
its
habitual
aspect
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
evening
,
at
which
season
of
all
others
Saint
Antoine
turned
himself
inside
out
,
and
sat
on
door
-
steps
and
window
-
ledges
,
and
came
to
the
corners
of
vile
streets
and
courts
,
for
a
breath
of
air
,
Madame
Defarge
with
her
work
in
her
hand
was
accustomed
to
pass
from
place
to
place
and
from
group
to
group
:
 
<EOS>
a
Missionary
<EOS>
---
there
were
many
like
her
---
such
as
the
world
<EOS>
will
do
well
never
to
breed
again
.
<EOS>
All
the
women
knitted
.
 
<EOS>
They
knitted
worthless
things
;
but
,
the
mechanical
work
was
a
mechanical
substitute
for
eating
and
drinking
;
the
hands
moved
for
the
jaws
and
the
digestive
apparatus
:
 
if
the
bony
fingers
had
been
still
,
the
stomachs
would
have
been
more
famine
-
pinched
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
as
the
fingers
went
,
the
eyes
went
,
and
the
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
Madame
Defarge
moved
on
from
group
to
group
,
all
three
went
quicker
and
fiercer
among
every
little
knot
of
women
that
she
had
spoken
with
,
and
left
behind
.
   
<EOS>
Her
husband
smoked
at
his
door
,
looking
after
her
with
admiration
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
great
woman
,
"
said
he
,
"
a
strong
woman
,
a
grand
woman
,
a
frightfully
grand
woman
!
"
   
<EOS>
Darkness
closed
around
,
and
then
came
the
ringing
of
church
bells
and
the
distant
beating
of
the
military
drums
in
the
Palace
Courtyard
,
as
the
women
sat
knitting
,
knitting
.
 
<EOS>
Darkness
encompassed
them
.
 
<EOS>
Another
darkness
was
closing
in
as
surely
,
when
the
church
bells
,
then
ringing
pleasantly
in
many
an
airy
steeple
over
France
,
should
be
melted
into
thundering
cannon
;
when
the
military
drums
should
be
beating
to
drown
a
wretched
voice
,
that
night
all
potent
as
the
voice
of
Power
and
Plenty
,
Freedom
and
Life
.
 
<EOS>
So
much
was
closing
in
about
the
women
who
sat
knitting
,
knitting
,
that
they
their
very
selves
were
closing
in
around
a
structure
yet
unbuilt
,
where
they
were
to
sit
knitting
,
knitting
,
counting
dropping
heads
.

One
Night
 
Never
did
the
sun
go
down
with
a
brighter
glory
on
the
quiet
corner
in
Soho
,
than
one
memorable
evening
when
the
Doctor
and
his
daughter
sat
under
the
plane
-
tree
together
.
 
<EOS>
Never
did
the
moon
rise
with
a
milder
radiance
over
great
London
,
than
on
that
night
when
it
found
them
still
seated
under
the
tree
,
and
shone
upon
their
faces
through
its
leaves
.
   
<EOS>
Lucie
was
to
be
married
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
reserved
this
last
evening
for
her
father
,
and
they
sat
alone
under
the
plane
-
tree
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
happy
,
my
dear
father
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
,
my
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
had
said
little
,
though
they
had
been
there
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
was
yet
light
enough
to
work
and
read
,
she
had
neither
engaged
herself
in
her
usual
work
,
nor
had
she
read
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
employed
herself
in
both
ways
,
at
his
side
under
the
tree
,
many
and
many
a
time
;
but
,
this
time
was
not
quite
like
any
other
,
and
nothing
could
make
it
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
am
very
happy
to
-
night
,
dear
father
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
deeply
happy
in
the
love
that
Heaven
has
so
blessed
---
my
love
for
Charles
,
and
Charles
's
love
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
if
my
life
were
not
to
be
still
consecrated
to
you
,
or
if
my
marriage
were
so
arranged
as
that
it
would
part
us
,
even
by
the
length
of
a
few
of
these
streets
,
I
should
be
more
unhappy
and
self
-
reproachful
now
than
I
can
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
Even
as
it
is
---
"
   
Even
as
it
was
,
she
could
not
command
her
voice
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
sad
moonlight
,
she
clasped
him
by
the
neck
,
and
laid
her
face
upon
his
breast
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
moonlight
which
is
always
sad
,
as
the
light
of
the
sun
itself
is
---
as
the
light
called
human
life
is
---
at
its
coming
and
its
going
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dearest
dear
!
 
<EOS>
Can
you
tell
me
,
this
last
time
,
that
you
feel
quite
,
quite
sure
,
no
new
affections
of
mine
,
and
no
new
duties
of
mine
,
will
ever
interpose
between
us
?
 
<EOS>
\I\
know
it
well
,
but
do
you
know
it
?
<EOS>
In
your
own
heart
,
do
you
feel
quite
certain
?
"
   
<EOS>
Her
father
answered
,
with
a
cheerful
firmness
of
conviction
he
could
scarcely
have
assumed
,
"
Quite
sure
,
my
darling
!
 
<EOS>
More
than
that
,
"
he
added
,
as
he
tenderly
kissed
her
:
 
"
<EOS>
my
future
is
far
brighter
,
Lucie
,
 
seen
through
your
marriage
,
than
it
could
have
been
---
nay
,
than
it
 
ever
was
---
without
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
could
hope
THAT
,
my
father
!
---
"
   
"
Believe
it
,
love
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
it
is
so
.
 
<EOS>
Consider
how
natural
and
how
plain
it
is
,
my
dear
,
that
it
should
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
You
,
devoted
and
young
,
can
not
fully
appreciate
the
anxiety
I
have
felt
that
your
life
should
not
be
wasted
---
"
   
She
moved
her
hand
towards
his
lips
,
but
he
took
it
in
his
,
and
repeated
the
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
wasted
,
my
child
---
should
not
be
wasted
,
struck
aside
from
the
natural
order
of
things
---
for
my
sake
.
 
<EOS>
Your
unselfishness
can
not
entirely
comprehend
how
much
my
mind
has
gone
on
this
;
but
,
only
ask
yourself
,
how
could
my
happiness
be
perfect
,
while
yours
was
incomplete
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
never
seen
Charles
,
my
father
,
I
should
have
been
quite
happy
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
smiled
at
her
unconscious
admission
that
she
would
have
been
unhappy
without
Charles
,
having
seen
him
;
and
replied
:
   
"
<EOS>
My
child
,
you
did
see
him
,
and
it
is
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
had
not
been
Charles
,
it
would
have
been
another
.
 
<EOS>
Or
,
if
it
had
been
no
other
,
I
should
have
been
the
cause
,
and
then
the
dark
part
of
my
life
would
have
cast
its
shadow
beyond
myself
,
and
would
have
fallen
on
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
,
except
at
the
trial
,
of
her
ever
hearing
him
refer
to
the
period
of
his
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
It
gave
her
a
strange
and
new
sensation
while
his
words
were
in
her
ears
;
and
she
remembered
it
long
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
"
See
!
"
said
the
Doctor
of
Beauvais
,
raising
his
hand
towards
the
moon
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
looked
at
her
from
my
prison
-
window
,
when
I
could
not
bear
her
light
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
looked
at
her
when
it
has
been
such
torture
to
me
to
think
of
her
shining
upon
what
I
had
lost
,
that
I
have
beaten
my
head
against
my
prison
-
walls
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
looked
at
her
,
in
a
state
<EOS>
so
dun
and
lethargic
,
<EOS>
that
I
have
thought
of
nothing
but
the
number
of
horizontal
lines
I
could
draw
across
her
at
the
full
,
and
the
number
of
perpendicular
lines
with
which
I
could
intersect
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
added
in
his
inward
and
pondering
manner
,
as
he
looked
at
the
moon
,
"
It
was
twenty
either
way
,
I
remember
,
and
the
twentieth
was
difficult
to
squeeze
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
strange
thrill
with
which
she
heard
him
go
back
to
that
time
,
deepened
as
he
dwelt
upon
it
;
but
,
there
was
nothing
to
shock
her
in
the
manner
of
his
reference
.
 
<EOS>
He
only
seemed
to
contrast
his
present
cheerfulness
and
felicity
with
the
dire
endurance
that
was
over
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
looked
at
her
,
speculating
thousands
of
times
upon
the
unborn
child
from
whom
I
had
been
rent
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
alive
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
it
had
been
born
alive
,
or
the
poor
mother
's
shock
had
killed
it
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
a
son
who
would
some
day
avenge
his
father
.
<EOS>
(
There
was
a
time
in
my
imprisonment
,
when
my
desire
for
vengeance
was
unbearable
.
)
 
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
a
son
who
would
never
know
his
father
's
story
;
who
might
even
live
to
weigh
the
possibility
of
his
father
's
having
disappeared
of
his
own
will
and
act
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
a
daughter
who
would
grow
to
be
a
woman
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
drew
closer
to
him
,
and
kissed
his
cheek
and
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
pictured
my
daughter
,
to
myself
,
as
perfectly
forgetful
of
me
 
---
<EOS>
rather
,
altogether
ignorant
of
me
,
and
unconscious
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
cast
up
the
years
of
her
age
,
year
after
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
her
married
to
a
man
who
knew
nothing
of
my
fate
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
altogether
perished
from
the
remembrance
of
the
living
,
and
in
the
next
generation
my
place
was
a
blank
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
father
!
 
<EOS>
Even
to
hear
that
you
had
such
thoughts
of
a
daughter
who
never
existed
,
strikes
to
my
heart
as
if
I
had
been
that
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
,
Lucie
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
out
of
the
Consolation
and
restoration
you
have
brought
to
me
,
that
these
remembrances
arise
,
and
pass
between
us
and
the
moon
on
this
last
night
.
<EOS>
---
What
did
I
say
just
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
knew
nothing
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
She
cared
nothing
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
!
 
<EOS>
But
on
other
moonlight
nights
,
when
the
sadness
and
the
silence
have
touched
me
in
a
different
way
---
have
affected
me
with
something
as
like
a
sorrowful
sense
of
peace
,
as
any
emotion
that
had
pain
for
its
foundations
could
---
I
have
imagined
her
as
coming
to
me
in
my
cell
,
and
leading
me
out
into
the
freedom
beyond
the
fortress
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
her
image
in
the
moonlight
often
,
as
I
now
see
you
;
except
that
I
never
held
her
in
my
arms
;
it
stood
between
the
little
grated
window
and
the
door
.
<EOS>
But
,
you
understand
that
that
was
not
the
child
I
am
speaking
of
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
figure
was
not
;
the
---
the
---
image
;
the
fancy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
another
thing
.
 
<EOS>
It
stood
before
my
disturbed
sense
of
sight
,
but
it
never
moved
.
 
<EOS>
The
phantom
that
my
mind
pursued
,
was
another
and
more
real
child
.
 
<EOS>
Of
her
outward
appearance
<EOS>
I
know
no
more
than
that
she
was
like
her
mother
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
had
that
likeness
too
 
---
as
you
have
---
but
was
not
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
follow
me
,
Lucie
?
<EOS>
Hardly
,
I
think
?
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
you
must
have
been
a
solitary
prisoner
to
understand
these
perplexed
distinctions
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
His
collected
and
calm
manner
could
not
prevent
her
blood
from
running
cold
,
as
he
thus
tried
to
anatomise
his
old
condition
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
that
more
peaceful
state
,
I
have
imagined
her
,
in
the
moonlight
,
coming
to
me
and
taking
me
out
to
show
me
that
the
home
of
her
married
life
was
full
of
her
loving
remembrance
of
her
lost
father
.
 
<EOS>
My
picture
was
in
her
room
,
and
I
was
in
her
prayers
.
 
<EOS>
Her
life
was
active
,
cheerful
,
useful
;
but
my
poor
history
pervaded
it
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
that
child
,
my
father
,
I
was
not
half
so
good
,
but
in
my
love
that
was
I.
"
   
"
<EOS>
And
she
showed
me
her
children
,
"
said
the
Doctor
of
Beauvais
,
"
and
they
had
heard
of
me
,
and
had
been
taught
to
pity
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
passed
a
prison
of
the
State
,
they
kept
far
from
its
frowning
walls
,
and
looked
up
at
its
bars
,
and
spoke
in
whispers
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
never
deliver
me
<EOS>
;
I
imagined
that
she
always
brought
me
back
after
showing
me
such
things
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
,
blessed
with
the
relief
of
tears
,
I
fell
upon
my
knees
,
and
blessed
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
that
child
,
I
hope
,
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
O
my
dear
,
my
dear
,
will
you
bless
me
as
fervently
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lucie
,
I
recall
these
old
troubles
in
the
reason
that
I
have
to
-
night
for
loving
you
better
than
words
can
tell
,
and
thanking
God
for
my
great
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
My
thoughts
,
when
they
were
wildest
,
never
rose
near
the
happiness
that
I
have
known
with
you
,
and
that
we
have
before
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
embraced
her
,
solemnly
commended
her
to
Heaven
,
and
humbly
thanked
Heaven
for
having
bestowed
her
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
bye
,
they
went
into
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
one
bidden
to
the
marriage
but
Mr
Lorry
;
there
was
even
to
be
no
bridesmaid
<EOS>
but
the
gaunt
Miss
Pross
.
 
<EOS>
The
marriage
was
to
make
no
change
in
their
place
of
residence
;
they
had
been
able
to
extend
it
,
by
taking
to
themselves
the
upper
rooms
formerly
belonging
to
the
apocryphal
invisible
lodger
,
and
they
desired
nothing
more
.
   
<EOS>
Doctor
Manette
was
very
cheerful
at
the
little
supper
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
only
three
at
table
,
and
Miss
Pross
made
the
third
.
 
<EOS>
He
regretted
that
Charles
was
not
there
;
was
more
than
half
disposed
to
object
to
the
loving
little
plot
that
kept
him
away
;
and
drank
to
him
affectionately
.
   
<EOS>
So
,
the
time
came
for
him
to
bid
Lucie
good
night
,
and
they
separated
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
stillness
of
the
third
hour
of
the
morning
,
Lucie
came
downstairs
again
,
and
stole
into
his
room
;
not
free
from
unshaped
fears
,
beforehand
.
   
<EOS>
All
things
,
however
,
were
in
their
places
;
all
was
quiet
;
and
he
lay
asleep
,
his
white
hair
picturesque
on
the
untroubled
pillow
,
and
his
hands
lying
quiet
on
the
coverlet
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
her
needless
candle
in
the
shadow
at
a
distance
,
crept
up
to
his
bed
,
and
put
her
lips
to
his
;
then
,
leaned
over
him
,
and
looked
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
Into
his
handsome
face
,
the
bitter
waters
of
captivity
had
worn
;
but
,
he
covered
up
their
tracks
with
a
determination
so
strong
,
that
he
held
the
mastery
of
them
even
in
his
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
A
more
remarkable
face
in
its
quiet
,
resolute
,
and
guarded
struggle
with
an
unseen
assailant
,
was
not
to
be
beheld
in
all
the
wide
dominions
of
sleep
,
that
night
.
   
<EOS>
She
timidly
laid
her
hand
on
his
dear
breast
,
and
put
up
a
prayer
that
she
might
ever
be
as
true
to
him
as
her
love
aspired
to
be
,
and
as
his
sorrows
deserved
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
she
withdrew
her
hand
,
and
kissed
his
lips
once
more
,
and
went
away
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
the
sunrise
came
,
and
the
shadows
of
the
leaves
of
the
plane
-
tree
moved
upon
his
face
,
as
softly
as
her
lips
had
moved
in
praying
for
him
.

Nine
Days
 
<EOS>
The
marriage
-
day
was
shining
brightly
,
and
they
were
ready
outside
the
closed
door
of
the
Doctor
's
room
,
where
he
was
speaking
with
Charles
Darnay
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
ready
to
go
to
church
;
the
beautiful
bride
,
Mr
Lorry
,
and
Miss
Pross
---
to
whom
the
event
,
through
a
gradual
process
of
reconcilement
to
the
inevitable
,
would
have
been
one
of
absolute
bliss
,
but
for
the
yet
lingering
consideration
that
her
brother
Solomon
should
have
been
the
bridegroom
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
who
could
not
sufficiently
admire
the
bride
,
and
who
had
been
moving
round
her
to
take
in
every
point
of
her
quiet
,
pretty
dress
;
"
and
so
it
was
for
this
,
my
sweet
Lucie
,
that
I
brought
you
across
the
Channel
,
such
a
baby
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
me
"
<EOS>
How
little
I
thought
what
I
was
doing
!
 
<EOS>
How
lightly
I
valued
the
obligation
I
was
conferring
on
my
friend
Mr
Charles
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
mean
it
,
"
remarked
the
matter
-
of
-
fact
Miss
Pross
,
"
and
therefore
how
could
you
know
it
?
 
<EOS>
Nonsense
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
?
 
<EOS>
Well
;
but
do
n't
cry
,
"
said
the
gentle
Mr
Lorry
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
crying
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
;
"
YOU
are
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
,
my
Pross
?
"
(
By
this
time
,
Mr
Lorry
dared
to
be
pleasant
with
her
,
on
occasion
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
You
were
,
just
now
;
I
saw
you
do
it
,
and
I
do
n't
wonder
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
present
of
plate
as
you
have
made
'em
,
is
enough
to
bring
tears
into
anybody
's
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
not
a
fork
or
a
spoon
in
the
collection
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
"
that
I
did
n't
cry
over
,
last
night
after
the
box
came
,
till
I
could
n't
see
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
highly
gratified
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
"
though
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
had
no
intention
of
rendering
those
trifling
articles
of
remembrance
invisible
to
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
an
occasion
that
makes
a
man
speculate
on
all
he
has
lost
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
,
<EOS>
dear
!
 
<EOS>
To
think
that
there
might
have
been
a
Mrs
Lorry
,
any
time
these
fifty
years
almost
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
!
"
 
<EOS>
From
Miss
Pross
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
think
there
never
might
have
been
a
Mrs
Lorry
?
"
asked
the
gentleman
of
that
name
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
"
rejoined
Miss
Pross
;
"
you
were
a
bachelor
in
your
cradle
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
observed
Mr
Lorry
,
beamingly
adjusting
his
little
wig
,
"
that
seems
probable
,
too
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
you
were
cut
out
for
a
bachelor
,
"
pursued
Miss
Pross
,
"
before
you
were
put
in
your
cradle
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
I
think
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
"
that
I
was
very
unhandsomely
dealt
with
,
and
that
I
ought
to
have
had
a
voice
in
the
selection
of
my
pattern
.
 
<EOS>
Enough
!
 
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
Lucie
,
"
drawing
his
arm
soothingly
round
her
waist
,
"
I
hear
them
moving
in
the
next
room
,
and
Miss
Pross
and
I
,
as
two
formal
folks
of
business
,
are
anxious
not
to
lose
the
final
opportunity
of
saying
something
to
you
that
you
wish
to
hear
.
<EOS>
You
leave
your
good
father
,
my
dear
,
in
hands
as
earnest
and
as
loving
as
your
own
;
he
shall
be
taken
every
conceivable
care
of
;
during
the
next
fortnight
,
while
you
are
in
Warwickshire
and
thereabouts
,
even
Tellson
's
shall
go
to
the
wall
(
comparatively
speaking
)
before
him
.
<EOS>
And
when
,
at
the
fortnight
's
end
,
he
comes
to
join
you
and
your
beloved
husband
,
on
your
other
fortnight
's
trip
in
Wales
,
you
shall
say
that
we
have
sent
him
to
you
in
the
best
health
and
in
the
happiest
frame
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
hear
Somebody
's
step
coming
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
kiss
my
dear
girl
with
an
old
-
fashioned
bachelor
blessing
,
before
Somebody
comes
to
claim
his
own
.
"
   
<EOS>
For
a
moment
,
he
held
the
fair
face
from
him
to
look
at
the
well
-
remembered
expression
on
the
forehead
,
and
then
laid
the
bright
golden
hair
against
his
little
brown
wig
,
with
a
genuine
tenderness
and
delicacy
which
,
if
such
things
be
old
-
fashioned
,
were
as
old
as
Adam
.
   
<EOS>
The
door
of
the
Doctor
's
room
opened
,
and
he
came
out
with
Charles
Darnay
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
deadly
pale
---
which
had
not
been
the
case
when
they
went
in
together
---
that
no
vestige
of
colour
was
to
be
seen
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
composure
of
his
manner
he
was
unaltered
,
except
that
to
the
shrewd
glance
of
Mr
Lorry
<EOS>
it
disclosed
some
shadowy
indication
that
the
old
air
of
avoidance
and
dread
had
lately
passed
over
him
,
like
a
cold
wind
.
   
<EOS>
He
gave
his
arm
to
his
daughter
,
and
took
her
down
-
stairs
to
the
chariot
which
Mr
Lorry
had
hired
in
honour
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
followed
in
another
carriage
,
and
soon
,
in
a
neighbouring
church
,
where
no
strange
eyes
looked
on
,
Charles
Darnay
and
Lucie
Manette
were
happily
married
.
   
<EOS>
Besides
the
glancing
tears
that
shone
among
the
smiles
of
the
little
group
when
it
was
done
,
some
diamonds
,
very
bright
and
sparkling
,
glanced
on
the
bride
's
hand
,
which
were
newly
released
from
the
dark
obscurity
of
one
of
Mr
Lorry
's
pockets
.
 
<EOS>
They
returned
home
to
breakfast
,
and
all
went
well
,
and
in
due
course
the
golden
hair
that
had
mingled
with
the
poor
shoemaker
's
white
locks
in
the
Paris
garret
,
were
mingled
with
them
again
in
the
morning
sunlight
,
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
at
parting
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
hard
parting
,
though
it
was
not
for
long
.
 
<EOS>
But
her
father
cheered
her
,
and
said
at
last
,
gently
disengaging
himself
from
her
enfolding
arms
,
"
Take
her
,
Charles
!
 
<EOS>
She
is
yours
!
"
   
<EOS>
And
her
agitated
hand
waved
to
them
from
a
chaise
window
,
and
she
was
gone
.
   
<EOS>
The
corner
being
out
of
the
way
of
the
idle
and
curious
,
and
the
preparations
having
been
very
simple
and
few
,
the
Doctor
,
Mr
Lorry
,
and
Miss
Pross
,
were
left
quite
alone
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
when
they
turned
into
the
welcome
shade
of
the
cool
old
hall
,
that
Mr
Lorry
observed
a
great
change
to
have
come
over
the
Doctor
;
as
if
the
golden
arm
uplifted
there
,
had
struck
him
a
poisoned
blow
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
naturally
repressed
much
,
and
some
revulsion
might
have
been
expected
in
him
when
the
occasion
for
repression
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
it
was
the
old
scared
lost
look
that
troubled
Mr
Lorry
;
and
through
his
absent
manner
of
clasping
his
head
and
drearily
wandering
away
into
his
own
room
when
they
got
up
-
stairs
,
Mr
Lorry
was
reminded
of
Defarge
the
wine
-
shop
keeper
,
and
the
starlight
ride
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
he
whispered
to
Miss
Pross
,
after
anxious
consideration
,
"
I
think
we
had
best
not
speak
to
him
just
now
,
or
at
all
disturb
him
.
<EOS>
I
must
look
in
at
Tellson
's
;
so
I
will
go
there
at
once
and
come
back
presently
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
we
will
take
him
a
ride
into
the
country
,
and
dine
there
,
and
all
will
be
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
easier
for
Mr
Lorry
to
look
in
at
Tellson
's
,
than
to
look
out
of
Tellson
's
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
detained
two
hours
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
came
back
,
he
ascended
the
old
staircase
alone
,
having
asked
no
question
of
the
servant
;
going
thus
into
the
Doctor
's
rooms
,
he
was
stopped
by
a
low
sound
of
knocking
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
God
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
with
a
start
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Pross
,
with
a
terrified
face
,
was
at
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
"
O
me
,
O
me
!
<EOS>
All
is
lost
!
"
<EOS>
cried
she
,
wringing
her
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
to
be
told
to
Ladybird
?
 
<EOS>
He
does
n't
know
me
,
and
is
making
shoes
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
said
what
he
could
to
calm
her
,
and
went
himself
into
the
Doctor
's
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
bench
was
turned
towards
the
light
,
as
it
had
been
when
he
had
seen
the
shoemaker
at
his
work
before
,
and
his
head
was
bent
down
,
and
he
was
very
busy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Doctor
Manette
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
Doctor
Manette
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
---
half
inquiringly
,
half
as
if
he
were
angry
at
being
spoken
to
---
and
bent
over
his
work
again
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
laid
aside
his
coat
and
waistcoat
;
his
shirt
was
open
at
the
throat
,
as
it
used
to
be
when
he
did
that
work
;
and
even
the
old
haggard
,
faded
surface
of
face
had
come
back
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
worked
hard
---
impatiently
---
as
if
in
some
sense
of
having
been
interrupted
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
glanced
at
the
work
in
his
hand
,
and
observed
that
it
was
a
shoe
of
the
old
size
and
shape
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
up
another
that
was
lying
by
him
,
and
asked
what
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
young
lady
's
walking
shoe
,
"
he
muttered
,
without
looking
up
.
<EOS>
"
It
ought
to
have
been
finished
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Let
it
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
Doctor
Manette
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
obeyed
,
in
the
old
mechanically
submissive
manner
,
without
pausing
in
his
work
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
me
,
my
dear
friend
?
 
<EOS>
Think
again
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
not
your
proper
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
Think
,
dear
friend
!
"
   
<EOS>
Nothing
would
induce
him
to
speak
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
up
,
for
an
instant
at
a
time
,
when
he
was
requested
to
do
so
;
but
,
no
persuasion
would
extract
a
word
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
worked
,
and
worked
,
and
worked
,
in
silence
,
and
words
fell
on
him
as
they
would
have
fallen
on
an
echoless
wall
,
or
on
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
ray
of
hope
that
Mr
Lorry
could
discover
,
was
,
that
he
sometimes
furtively
looked
up
without
being
asked
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
,
there
seemed
a
faint
expression
of
curiosity
or
perplexity
---
as
though
he
were
trying
to
reconcile
some
doubts
in
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
Two
things
at
once
impressed
themselves
on
Mr
Lorry
,
as
important
above
all
others
;
the
first
,
that
this
must
be
kept
secret
from
Lucie
;
the
second
,
that
it
must
be
kept
secret
from
all
who
knew
him
.
 
<EOS>
In
conjunction
with
Miss
Pross
,
he
took
immediate
steps
towards
the
latter
precaution
,
by
giving
out
that
the
Doctor
was
not
well
,
and
required
a
few
days
of
complete
rest
.
 
<EOS>
In
aid
of
the
kind
deception
to
be
practised
on
his
daughter
,
Miss
Pross
was
to
write
,
describing
his
having
been
called
away
professionally
,
and
referring
to
an
imaginary
letter
of
two
or
three
hurried
lines
in
his
own
hand
,
represented
to
have
been
addressed
to
her
by
the
same
post
.
   
<EOS>
These
measures
,
advisable
to
be
taken
in
any
case
<EOS>
,
Mr
Lorry
took
in
the
hope
of
his
coming
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
If
that
should
happen
soon
,
he
kept
another
course
in
reserve
;
which
was
,
to
have
a
certain
opinion
that
he
thought
the
best
,
on
the
Doctor
's
case
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
hope
of
his
recovery
,
and
of
resort
to
this
third
course
being
thereby
rendered
practicable
,
Mr
Lorry
resolved
to
watch
him
attentively
,
with
as
little
appearance
as
possible
of
doing
so
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
made
arrangements
to
absent
himself
from
Tellson
's
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
and
took
his
post
by
the
window
in
the
same
room
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
not
long
in
discovering
that
it
was
worse
than
useless
to
speak
to
him
,
since
,
on
being
pressed
,
he
became
worried
.
 
<EOS>
He
abandoned
that
attempt
on
the
first
day
,
and
resolved
merely
to
keep
himself
always
before
him
,
as
a
silent
protest
against
the
delusion
into
which
he
had
fallen
,
or
was
failing
.
 
<EOS>
He
remained
,
therefore
,
in
his
seat
near
the
window
,
reading
and
writing
,
and
expressing
in
as
many
pleasant
and
natural
ways
as
he
could
think
of
,
that
it
was
a
free
place
.
   
<EOS>
Doctor
Manette
took
what
was
given
him
to
eat
and
drink
,
and
worked
on
,
that
first
day
,
until
it
was
too
dark
to
see
---
worked
on
,
half
an
hour
after
Mr
Lorry
could
not
have
seen
,
for
his
life
,
to
read
or
write
.
<EOS>
When
he
put
his
tools
aside
as
useless
,
until
morning
,
Mr
Lorry
rose
and
said
to
him
:
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
go
out
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
looked
down
at
the
floor
on
either
side
of
him
in
the
old
manner
,
looked
up
in
the
old
manner
,
and
repeated
in
the
old
low
voice
:
   
"
Out
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
for
a
walk
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Why
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
made
no
effort
to
say
why
not
,
and
said
not
a
word
more
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Mr
Lorry
thought
he
saw
,
as
he
leaned
forward
on
his
bench
in
the
dusk
,
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
head
in
his
hands
,
that
he
was
in
some
misty
way
asking
himself
,
"
Why
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
sagacity
of
the
man
of
business
perceived
an
advantage
here
,
and
determined
to
hold
it
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Pross
and
<EOS>
he
divided
the
night
into
two
watches
,
and
observed
him
at
intervals
from
the
adjoining
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
paced
up
and
down
for
a
long
time
before
he
lay
down
;
but
,
when
he
did
finally
lay
himself
down
,
he
fell
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
morning
,
he
was
up
betimes
,
and
went
straight
to
his
bench
and
to
work
.
   
<EOS>
On
this
second
day
,
Mr
Lorry
saluted
him
cheerfully
by
his
name
,
and
spoke
to
him
on
topics
that
had
been
of
late
familiar
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
returned
no
reply
,
but
it
was
evident
that
he
heard
what
was
said
,
and
that
he
thought
about
it
,
however
confusedly
.
 
<EOS>
This
encouraged
Mr
Lorry
to
have
Miss
Pross
in
with
her
work
,
several
times
during
the
day
;
at
those
times
,
they
quietly
spoke
of
Lucie
,
and
of
her
father
then
present
,
precisely
in
the
usual
manner
,
and
as
if
there
were
nothing
amiss
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
done
without
any
demonstrative
accompaniment
,
not
long
enough
,
or
often
enough
to
harass
him
;
and
it
lightened
Mr
Lorry
's
friendly
heart
to
believe
that
he
looked
up
oftener
,
and
that
he
appeared
to
be
stirred
by
some
perception
of
inconsistencies
surrounding
him
.
   
<EOS>
When
it
fell
dark
again
,
Mr
Lorry
asked
him
as
before
:
   
"
Dear
Doctor
,
will
you
go
out
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
before
,
he
repeated
,
"
Out
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
for
a
walk
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Why
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
This
time
,
Mr
Lorry
feigned
to
go
out
when
he
could
extract
no
answer
from
him
,
and
,
after
remaining
absent
for
an
hour
,
returned
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
,
the
Doctor
had
removed
to
the
seat
in
the
window
,
and
had
sat
there
looking
down
at
the
plane
-
tree
;
but
,
on
Mr
Lorry
's
return
,
be
slipped
away
to
his
bench
.
   
<EOS>
The
time
went
very
slowly
on
,
and
Mr
Lorry
's
hope
darkened
,
and
his
heart
grew
heavier
again
,
and
grew
yet
heavier
and
heavier
every
day
.
<EOS>
The
third
day
came
and
went
,
the
fourth
,
the
fifth
.
 
<EOS>
Five
days
,
six
days
,
seven
days
,
eight
days
,
nine
days
.
   
<EOS>
With
a
hope
ever
darkening
,
and
with
a
heart
always
growing
heavier
and
heavier
,
Mr
Lorry
passed
through
this
anxious
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
secret
was
well
kept
,
and
Lucie
was
unconscious
and
happy
;
but
he
could
not
fail
to
observe
that
the
shoemaker
,
whose
hand
had
been
a
little
out
at
first
,
was
growing
dreadfully
skilful
,
and
that
he
had
never
been
so
intent
on
his
work
,
and
that
his
hands
had
never
been
so
nimble
and
expert
,
as
in
the
dusk
of
the
ninth
evening
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
19
.
<EOS>
An
Opinion
 
Worn
out
by
anxious
watching
<EOS>
,
Mr
Lorry
fell
asleep
at
his
post
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
tenth
morning
of
his
suspense
,
he
was
startled
by
the
shining
of
the
sun
into
the
room
where
a
heavy
slumber
had
overtaken
him
when
it
was
dark
night
.
   
<EOS>
He
rubbed
his
eyes
and
roused
himself
;
but
he
doubted
,
when
he
had
done
so
,
whether
he
was
not
still
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
going
to
the
door
of
the
Doctor
's
room
and
looking
in
,
he
perceived
that
the
shoemaker
's
bench
and
tools
were
put
aside
again
,
and
that
the
Doctor
himself
sat
reading
at
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
his
usual
morning
dress
,
and
his
face
(
which
Mr
Lorry
could
distinctly
see
)
,
though
still
very
pale
,
was
calmly
studious
and
attentive
.
   
<EOS>
Even
when
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
he
was
awake
,
Mr
Lorry
felt
giddily
uncertain
for
some
few
moments
whether
the
late
shoemaking
might
not
be
a
disturbed
dream
of
his
own
;
for
,
did
not
his
eyes
show
him
his
friend
before
him
in
his
accustomed
clothing
and
aspect
,
and
employed
as
usual
;
and
was
there
any
sign
within
their
range
,
that
the
change
of
which
he
had
so
strong
an
impression
had
actually
happened
?
   
<EOS>
It
was
<EOS>
but
the
inquiry
of
his
first
confusion
and
astonishment
,
the
answer
being
obvious
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
impression
were
not
produced
by
a
real
corresponding
and
sufficient
cause
,
how
came
he
,
Jarvis
Lorry
,
there
?
<EOS>
How
came
he
to
have
fallen
asleep
,
in
his
clothes
,
on
the
sofa
in
Doctor
Manette
's
consulting
-
room
,
and
to
be
debating
these
points
outside
the
Doctor
's
bedroom
door
in
the
early
morning
?
   
<EOS>
Within
a
few
minutes
,
Miss
Pross
stood
whispering
at
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
had
any
particle
of
doubt
left
,
her
talk
would
of
necessity
have
resolved
it
;
but
he
was
by
that
time
clear
-
headed
,
and
had
none
.
 
<EOS>
He
advised
that
they
should
let
the
time
go
by
until
the
regular
breakfast
-
hour
,
and
should
then
meet
the
Doctor
as
if
nothing
unusual
had
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
appeared
to
be
in
his
customary
state
of
mind
,
Mr
Lorry
would
then
cautiously
proceed
to
seek
direction
and
guidance
from
the
opinion
he
had
been
,
in
his
anxiety
,
so
anxious
to
obtain
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Pross
,
submitting
herself
to
his
judgment
,
the
scheme
was
worked
out
with
care
.
 
<EOS>
Having
abundance
of
time
for
his
usual
methodical
toilette
,
Mr
Lorry
presented
himself
at
the
breakfast
-
hour
in
his
usual
white
linen
,
and
with
his
usual
neat
leg
.
 
<EOS>
The
Doctor
was
summoned
in
the
usual
way
,
and
came
to
breakfast
.
   
<EOS>
So
far
as
it
was
possible
to
comprehend
him
without
overstepping
those
delicate
and
gradual
approaches
which
Mr
Lorry
felt
to
be
the
only
safe
advance
,
he
at
first
supposed
that
his
daughter
's
marriage
had
taken
place
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
An
incidental
allusion
,
purposely
thrown
out
,
to
the
day
of
the
week
,
and
the
day
of
the
month
,
set
him
thinking
and
counting
,
and
evidently
made
him
uneasy
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
other
respects
,
however
,
he
was
so
composedly
himself
,
that
Mr
Lorry
determined
to
have
the
aid
he
sought
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
aid
was
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
Therefore
,
when
the
breakfast
was
done
and
cleared
away
,
and
he
and
the
Doctor
were
left
together
,
Mr
Lorry
said
,
feelingly
:
   
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Manette
,
I
am
anxious
to
have
your
opinion
,
in
confidence
,
on
a
very
curious
case
in
which
I
am
deeply
interested
;
that
is
to
say
,
it
is
very
curious
to
me
;
perhaps
,
to
your
better
information
it
may
be
less
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
Glancing
at
his
hands
,
which
were
discoloured
by
his
late
work
,
the
Doctor
looked
troubled
,
and
listened
attentively
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
already
glanced
at
his
hands
more
than
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
Doctor
Manette
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
touching
him
affectionately
on
the
arm
,
"
the
case
is
the
case
of
a
particularly
dear
friend
of
mine
.
<EOS>
Pray
give
your
mind
to
it
,
and
advise
me
well
for
his
sake
---
and
above
all
,
for
his
daughter
's
---
his
daughter
's
,
my
dear
Manette
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
understand
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
in
a
subdued
tone
,
"
some
mental
shock
---
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Be
explicit
,
"
said
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Spare
no
detail
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
saw
that
they
understood
one
another
,
and
proceeded
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Manette
,
it
is
the
case
of
an
old
and
a
prolonged
shock
,
of
great
acuteness
and
severity
to
the
affections
,
the
feelings
,
the
---
<EOS>
the
---
as
you
express
it
---
the
mind
.
 
<EOS>
The
mind
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
case
of
a
shock
under
which
the
sufferer
was
borne
down
,
one
can
not
say
for
how
long
,
because
I
believe
he
can
not
calculate
the
time
himself
,
and
there
are
no
other
means
of
getting
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
case
of
a
shock
from
which
the
sufferer
recovered
,
by
a
process
that
he
can
not
trace
himself
---
as
I
once
heard
him
publicly
relate
in
a
striking
manner
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
case
of
a
shock
from
which
he
has
recovered
,
so
completely
,
as
to
be
a
highly
intelligent
man
,
capable
of
close
application
of
mind
,
and
great
exertion
of
body
,
and
of
constantly
making
fresh
additions
to
his
stock
of
knowledge
,
which
was
already
very
large
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
unfortunately
,
there
has
been
,
"
he
paused
and
took
a
deep
breath
---
"
a
slight
relapse
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
,
in
a
low
voice
,
asked
,
"
Of
how
long
duration
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nine
days
and
nights
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
did
it
show
itself
?
 
<EOS>
I
infer
,
"
glancing
at
his
hands
again
,
"
in
the
resumption
of
some
old
pursuit
connected
with
the
shock
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
fact
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
did
you
ever
see
him
,
"
asked
the
Doctor
,
distinctly
and
collectedly
,
though
in
the
same
low
voice
,
"
engaged
in
that
pursuit
originally
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Once
.
"
   
"
And
when
the
relapse
fell
on
him
,
was
he
in
most
respects
---
or
in
all
respects
---
as
he
was
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
in
all
respects
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
spoke
of
his
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Does
his
daughter
know
of
the
relapse
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
kept
from
her
,
and
I
hope
will
always
be
kept
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
known
only
to
myself
,
and
to
one
other
who
may
be
trusted
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
grasped
his
band
,
and
murmured
,
"
That
was
very
kind
.
<EOS>
That
was
very
thoughtful
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
grasped
his
hand
in
return
,
and
neither
of
the
two
spoke
for
a
little
while
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
dear
Manette
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
at
length
,
in
his
most
considerate
and
most
affectionate
way
,
"
I
am
a
mere
man
of
business
,
and
unfit
to
cope
with
such
intricate
and
difficult
matters
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
possess
the
kind
of
information
necessary
;
I
do
not
possess
the
kind
of
intelligence
;
I
want
guiding
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
man
in
this
world
on
whom
I
could
so
rely
for
right
guidance
,
as
on
you
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
how
does
this
relapse
come
about
?
 
<EOS>
Is
there
danger
of
another
?
 
<EOS>
Could
a
repetition
of
it
be
prevented
?
 
<EOS>
How
should
a
repetition
of
it
be
treated
?
 
<EOS>
How
does
it
come
about
at
all
?
 
<EOS>
What
can
I
do
for
my
friend
?
<EOS>
No
man
ever
can
have
been
more
desirous
in
his
heart
to
serve
a
friend
,
than
I
am
to
serve
mine
,
if
I
knew
how
.
   
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
know
how
to
originate
,
in
such
a
case
.
 
<EOS>
If
your
sagacity
,
knowledge
,
and
experience
,
could
put
me
on
the
right
track
,
I
might
be
able
to
do
so
much
;
unenlightened
and
undirected
,
I
can
do
so
little
.
<EOS>
Pray
discuss
it
with
me
;
pray
enable
me
to
see
it
a
little
more
clearly
,
and
teach
me
how
to
be
a
little
more
useful
.
"
   
<EOS>
Doctor
Manette
sat
meditating
after
these
earnest
words
were
spoken
,
and
Mr
Lorry
did
not
press
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
probable
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
breaking
silence
with
an
effort
,
"
that
the
relapse
you
have
described
,
my
dear
friend
,
was
not
quite
unforeseen
by
its
subject
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Was
it
dreaded
by
him
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
ventured
to
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
much
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
said
it
with
an
involuntary
shudder
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
idea
how
such
an
apprehension
weighs
on
the
sufferer
's
mind
,
and
how
difficult
<EOS>
---
how
almost
impossible
---
it
is
,
for
him
to
force
himself
to
utter
a
word
upon
the
topic
that
oppresses
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
he
,
"
asked
Mr
Lorry
,
"
be
sensibly
relieved
if
he
could
prevail
upon
himself
to
impart
that
secret
brooding
to
any
one
,
when
it
is
on
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
,
as
I
have
told
you
,
next
to
impossible
.
<EOS>
I
even
believe
it
---
in
some
cases
---
to
be
quite
impossible
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
gently
laying
his
hand
on
the
Doctor
's
arm
again
,
after
a
short
silence
on
both
sides
,
"
to
what
would
you
refer
this
attack
?
 
<EOS>
"
   
"
I
believe
,
"
returned
Doctor
Manette
,
"
that
there
had
been
a
strong
and
extraordinary
revival
of
the
train
of
thought
and
remembrance
that
was
the
first
cause
of
the
malady
.
 
<EOS>
Some
intense
associations
of
a
most
distressing
nature
were
vividly
recalled
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
probable
that
there
had
long
been
a
dread
lurking
in
his
mind
,
that
those
associations
would
be
recalled
---
say
,
under
certain
circumstances
---
say
,
on
a
particular
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
He
tried
to
prepare
himself
in
vain
;
perhaps
the
effort
to
prepare
himself
made
him
less
able
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
he
remember
what
took
place
in
the
relapse
?
"
asked
Mr
Lorry
,
with
natural
hesitation
.
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
looked
desolately
round
the
room
,
shook
his
head
,
and
answered
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
Not
at
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
as
to
the
future
,
"
hinted
Mr
Lorry
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
the
future
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
recovering
firmness
,
"
I
should
have
great
hope
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
pleased
Heaven
in
its
mercy
to
restore
him
so
soon
,
I
should
have
great
hope
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
yielding
under
the
pressure
of
a
complicated
something
,
long
dreaded
and
long
vaguely
foreseen
and
contended
against
,
and
recovering
after
the
cloud
had
burst
and
passed
,
I
should
hope
that
the
worst
was
over
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
good
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
thankful
!
"
said
Mr
Lorry
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
thankful
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
the
Doctor
,
bending
his
head
with
reverence
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
are
two
other
points
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
"
on
which
I
am
anxious
to
be
instructed
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
go
on
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
do
your
friend
a
better
service
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
Doctor
gave
him
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
the
first
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
of
a
studious
habit
,
and
unusually
energetic
;
he
applies
himself
with
great
ardour
to
the
acquisition
of
professional
knowledge
,
to
the
conducting
of
experiments
,
to
many
things
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
does
he
do
too
much
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
the
character
of
his
mind
,
to
be
always
in
singular
need
of
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
That
may
be
,
in
part
,
natural
to
it
;
in
part
,
the
result
of
affliction
.
 
<EOS>
The
less
it
was
occupied
with
healthy
things
,
the
more
it
would
be
in
danger
of
turning
in
the
unhealthy
direction
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
have
observed
himself
,
and
made
the
discovery
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
sure
that
he
is
not
under
too
great
a
strain
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
am
quite
sure
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Manette
,
if
he
were
overworked
now
---
"
   
"
My
dear
Lorry
,
I
doubt
if
that
could
easily
be
.
 
<EOS>
There
has
been
a
violent
stress
in
one
direction
,
and
it
needs
a
counterweight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
as
a
persistent
man
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
Assuming
for
a
moment
,
that
he
WAS
overworked
;
it
would
show
itself
in
some
renewal
of
this
disorder
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
,
"
said
Doctor
Manette
with
the
firmness
of
self
-
conviction
,
"
that
anything
but
the
one
train
of
association
would
renew
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
that
,
henceforth
,
nothing
but
some
extraordinary
jarring
of
that
chord
could
renew
it
.
 
<EOS>
After
what
has
happened
,
and
after
his
recovery
,
I
find
it
difficult
to
imagine
any
such
violent
sounding
of
that
string
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
,
and
I
almost
believe
,
that
the
circumstances
likely
to
renew
it
are
exhausted
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
spoke
with
the
diffidence
of
a
man
who
knew
how
slight
a
thing
would
overset
the
delicate
organisation
of
the
mind
,
and
yet
with
the
confidence
of
a
man
who
had
slowly
won
his
assurance
out
of
personal
endurance
and
distress
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
for
his
friend
to
abate
that
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
He
professed
himself
more
relieved
and
encouraged
than
he
really
was
,
and
approached
his
second
and
last
point
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
it
to
be
the
most
difficult
of
all
;
but
,
remembering
his
old
Sunday
morning
conversation
with
Miss
Pross
,
and
remembering
what
he
had
seen
in
the
last
nine
days
<EOS>
,
he
knew
that
he
must
face
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
occupation
resumed
under
the
influence
of
this
passing
affliction
so
happily
recovered
from
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
clearing
his
throat
<EOS>
,
"
we
will
call
---
<EOS>
Blacksmith
's
work
,
Blacksmith
's
work
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
say
,
to
put
a
case
and
for
the
sake
of
illustration
,
that
he
had
been
used
,
in
his
bad
time
,
to
work
at
a
little
forge
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
say
that
he
was
unexpectedly
found
at
his
forge
again
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
a
pity
that
he
should
keep
it
by
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
shaded
his
forehead
with
his
hand
,
and
beat
his
foot
nervously
on
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
always
kept
it
by
him
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
with
an
anxious
look
at
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
would
it
not
be
better
that
he
should
let
it
go
?
"
   
<EOS>
Still
,
the
Doctor
,
with
shaded
forehead
,
beat
his
foot
nervously
on
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
find
it
easy
to
advise
me
?
"
said
Mr
Lorry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
quite
understand
it
to
be
a
nice
question
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
I
think
---
<EOS>
"
And
there
he
shook
his
head
,
and
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
said
Doctor
Manette
,
turning
to
him
after
an
uneasy
pause
,
"
it
is
very
hard
to
explain
,
consistently
,
the
innermost
workings
of
this
poor
man
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
once
yearned
so
frightfully
for
that
occupation
,
and
it
was
so
welcome
when
it
came
;
no
doubt
it
relieved
his
pain
so
much
,
by
substituting
the
perplexity
of
the
fingers
for
the
perplexity
of
the
brain
,
and
by
substituting
,
as
he
became
more
practised
,
the
ingenuity
of
the
hands
,
for
the
ingenuity
of
the
mental
torture
;
that
he
has
never
been
able
to
bear
the
thought
of
putting
it
quite
out
of
his
reach
.
 
<EOS>
Even
now
,
when
I
believe
he
is
more
hopeful
of
himself
than
he
has
ever
been
,
and
even
speaks
of
himself
with
a
kind
of
confidence
,
the
idea
that
he
might
need
that
old
employment
,
and
not
find
it
,
gives
him
a
sudden
sense
of
terror
,
like
that
which
one
may
fancy
strikes
to
the
heart
of
a
lost
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
looked
like
his
illustration
,
as
he
raised
his
eyes
to
Mr
Lorry
's
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
may
not
---
mind
!
 
<EOS>
I
ask
for
information
,
as
a
plodding
man
of
business
who
only
deals
with
such
material
objects
as
guineas
,
shillings
,
and
bank
-
notes
---
may
not
the
retention
of
the
thing
involve
the
retention
of
the
idea
?
 
<EOS>
If
the
thing
were
gone
,
my
dear
Manette
,
might
not
the
fear
go
with
it
?
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
is
it
not
a
concession
to
the
misgiving
,
to
keep
the
forge
?
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
another
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
too
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
tremulously
,
"
it
is
such
an
old
companion
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
keep
it
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
shaking
his
head
;
for
he
gained
in
firmness
as
he
saw
the
Doctor
disquieted
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
recommend
him
to
sacrifice
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
want
your
authority
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
does
no
good
.
 
<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Give
me
your
authority
,
like
a
dear
good
man
.
 
<EOS>
For
his
daughter
's
sake
,
my
dear
Manette
!
"
   
<EOS>
Very
strange
to
see
what
a
struggle
there
was
within
him
!
   
<EOS>
"
In
her
name
,
then
,
let
it
be
done
;
I
sanction
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
I
would
not
take
it
away
while
he
was
present
.
 
<EOS>
Let
it
be
removed
when
he
is
not
there
;
let
him
miss
his
old
companion
after
an
absence
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
readily
engaged
for
that
,
and
the
conference
was
ended
.
<EOS>
They
passed
the
day
in
the
country
,
and
the
Doctor
was
quite
restored
.
<EOS>
On
the
three
following
days
he
remained
perfectly
well
,
and
on
the
fourteenth
day
he
went
away
to
join
Lucie
and
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
The
precaution
that
had
been
taken
to
account
for
his
silence
,
Mr
Lorry
had
previously
explained
to
him
,
and
he
had
written
to
Lucie
in
accordance
with
it
,
and
she
had
no
suspicions
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
night
of
the
day
on
which
he
left
the
house
,
Mr
Lorry
went
into
his
room
with
a
chopper
,
saw
,
chisel
,
and
hammer
,
attended
by
Miss
Pross
carrying
a
light
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
with
closed
doors
,
and
in
a
mysterious
and
guilty
manner
,
Mr
Lorry
hacked
the
shoemaker
's
bench
to
pieces
,
while
Miss
Pross
held
the
candle
as
if
she
were
assisting
at
a
murder
---
for
which
,
indeed
,
in
her
grimness
,
she
was
no
unsuitable
figure
.
 
<EOS>
The
burning
of
the
body
(
previously
reduced
to
pieces
convenient
for
the
purpose
)
was
commenced
without
delay
in
the
kitchen
fire
;
and
the
tools
,
shoes
,
and
leather
,
were
buried
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
So
wicked
do
destruction
and
secrecy
appear
to
honest
minds
,
that
Mr
Lorry
and
Miss
Pross
,
while
engaged
in
the
commission
of
their
deed
and
in
the
removal
of
its
traces
,
almost
felt
,
and
almost
looked
,
like
accomplices
in
a
horrible
crime
.

<EOS>
A
Plea
 
<EOS>
When
the
newly
-
married
pair
came
home
,
the
first
person
who
appeared
,
to
offer
his
congratulations
,
was
Sydney
Carton
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
not
been
at
home
many
hours
,
when
he
presented
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
improved
in
habits
,
or
in
looks
,
or
in
manner
;
but
there
was
a
certain
rugged
air
of
fidelity
about
him
,
which
was
new
to
the
observation
of
Charles
Darnay
.
   
<EOS>
He
watched
his
opportunity
of
taking
Darnay
aside
into
a
window
,
and
of
speaking
to
him
when
no
one
overheard
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Darnay
,
"
said
Carton
,
"
I
wish
we
might
be
friends
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
already
friends
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
good
enough
to
say
so
,
as
a
fashion
of
speech
;
but
,
I
do
n't
mean
any
fashion
of
speech
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
when
I
say
I
wish
we
might
be
friends
,
I
scarcely
mean
quite
that
,
either
.
"
   
<EOS>
Charles
Darnay
---
<EOS>
as
was
natural
---
asked
him
,
in
all
good
-
humour
and
good
-
fellowship
,
what
he
did
mean
?
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
life
,
"
said
Carton
,
smiling
,
<EOS>
"
I
find
that
easier
to
comprehend
in
my
own
mind
,
than
to
convey
to
yours
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
let
me
try
.
 
<EOS>
You
remember
a
certain
famous
occasion
when
I
was
more
drunk
than
---
than
usual
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
remember
a
certain
famous
occasion
when
you
forced
me
to
confess
that
you
had
been
drinking
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
remember
it
too
.
 
<EOS>
The
curse
of
those
occasions
is
heavy
upon
me
,
for
I
always
remember
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
may
be
taken
into
account
one
day
,
when
all
days
are
at
an
end
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
alarmed
;
I
am
not
going
to
preach
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
at
all
alarmed
.
 
<EOS>
Earnestness
in
you
,
is
anything
but
alarming
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Carton
,
with
a
careless
wave
of
his
hand
,
as
if
he
waved
that
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
the
drunken
occasion
in
question
(
one
of
a
large
number
,
as
you
know
)
,
I
was
insufferable
about
liking
you
,
and
not
liking
you
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
forget
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
forgot
it
long
ago
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fashion
of
speech
again
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
Mr
Darnay
,
oblivion
is
not
so
easy
to
me
,
as
you
represent
it
to
be
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
by
no
means
forgotten
it
,
and
a
light
answer
does
not
help
me
to
forget
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
was
a
light
answer
,
"
returned
Darnay
,
"
I
beg
your
forgiveness
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
other
object
than
to
turn
a
slight
thing
,
which
,
to
my
surprise
,
seems
to
trouble
you
too
much
,
aside
.
 
<EOS>
I
declare
to
you
,
on
the
faith
of
a
gentleman
,
that
I
have
long
dismissed
it
from
my
mind
.
<EOS>
Good
Heaven
,
what
was
there
to
dismiss
!
 
<EOS>
Have
I
had
nothing
more
important
to
remember
,
in
the
great
service
you
rendered
me
that
day
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
the
great
service
,
"
said
Carton
,
"
I
am
bound
to
avow
to
you
,
<EOS>
when
you
speak
of
it
in
that
way
,
that
it
was
mere
professional
claptrap
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
that
I
cared
what
became
of
you
,
when
I
rendered
 
it
.
<EOS>
---
Mind
!
 
<EOS>
I
say
when
I
rendered
it
;
I
am
speaking
of
the
past
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
make
light
of
the
obligation
,
"
returned
Darnay
,
"
but
I
will
not
quarrel
with
YOUR
light
answer
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Genuine
truth
,
Mr
Darnay
,
trust
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
gone
aside
from
my
purpose
;
I
was
speaking
about
our
being
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
you
know
me
;
you
know
I
am
incapable
of
all
the
higher
and
better
flights
of
men
.
<EOS>
If
you
doubt
it
,
ask
Stryver
,
and
he
'll
tell
you
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
prefer
to
form
my
own
opinion
,
without
the
aid
of
his
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
At
any
rate
you
know
me
as
a
dissolute
dog
,
who
has
never
done
any
good
,
and
never
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
you
"
never
will
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
,
and
you
must
take
my
word
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
If
you
could
endure
to
have
such
a
worthless
fellow
,
and
a
fellow
of
such
indifferent
reputation
,
coming
and
going
at
odd
times
,
I
should
ask
that
I
might
be
permitted
to
come
and
go
as
a
privileged
person
here
;
that
I
might
be
regarded
as
an
useless
(
and
I
would
add
,
if
it
were
not
for
the
resemblance
I
detected
between
you
and
me
,
an
unornamental
)
piece
of
furniture
,
tolerated
for
its
old
service
,
and
taken
no
notice
of
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
I
should
abuse
the
permission
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
hundred
to
one
if
I
should
avail
myself
of
it
four
times
in
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
satisfy
me
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
to
know
that
I
had
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
try
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
another
way
of
saying
that
I
am
placed
on
the
footing
I
have
indicated
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
you
,
Darnay
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
use
that
freedom
with
your
name
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
,
Carton
,
by
this
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
shook
hands
upon
it
,
and
Sydney
turned
away
.
 
<EOS>
Within
a
minute
afterwards
,
he
was
,
to
all
outward
appearance
,
as
unsubstantial
as
ever
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
was
gone
,
and
in
the
course
of
an
evening
passed
with
Miss
Pross
,
the
Doctor
,
and
Mr
Lorry
,
Charles
Darnay
made
some
mention
of
this
conversation
in
general
terms
,
and
spoke
of
Sydney
Carton
as
a
problem
of
carelessness
and
recklessness
.
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
of
him
,
in
short
,
not
bitterly
or
meaning
to
bear
hard
upon
him
,
but
as
anybody
might
who
saw
him
as
he
showed
himself
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
no
idea
that
this
could
dwell
in
the
thoughts
of
his
fair
young
wife
;
but
,
when
he
afterwards
joined
her
in
their
own
rooms
,
he
found
her
waiting
for
him
with
the
old
pretty
lifting
of
the
forehead
strongly
marked
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
thoughtful
to
-
night
!
"
<EOS>
said
Darnay
,
drawing
his
arm
about
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
dearest
Charles
,
"
with
her
hands
on
his
breast
,
and
the
inquiring
and
attentive
expression
fixed
upon
him
;
"
we
are
rather
thoughtful
to
-
night
,
for
we
have
something
on
our
mind
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
,
my
Lucie
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
promise
not
to
press
one
question
on
me
,
if
I
beg
you
not
to
ask
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
I
promise
?
 
<EOS>
What
will
I
not
promise
to
my
Love
?
"
   
<EOS>
What
,
indeed
,
with
his
hand
putting
aside
the
golden
hair
from
the
cheek
,
and
his
other
hand
against
the
heart
that
beat
for
him
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Charles
,
poor
Mr
Carton
deserves
more
consideration
and
respect
than
you
expressed
for
him
to
-
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
my
own
?
 
<EOS>
Why
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
what
you
are
not
to
ask
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
think
---
<EOS>
I
know
---
he
does
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
know
it
,
it
is
enough
.
 
<EOS>
What
would
you
have
me
do
,
my
Life
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
ask
you
,
dearest
,
to
be
very
generous
with
him
always
,
and
very
lenient
on
his
faults
when
he
is
not
by
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
ask
you
to
believe
that
he
has
a
heart
he
very
,
very
seldom
reveals
,
and
that
there
are
deep
wounds
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
,
I
have
seen
it
bleeding
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
painful
reflection
to
me
,
"
said
Charles
Darnay
,
quite
astounded
,
"
that
I
should
have
done
him
any
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
thought
this
of
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
husband
,
it
is
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
he
is
not
to
be
reclaimed
;
there
is
scarcely
a
hope
that
anything
in
his
character
or
fortunes
is
reparable
now
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
I
am
sure
that
he
is
capable
of
good
things
,
gentle
things
,
even
magnanimous
things
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
looked
so
beautiful
in
the
purity
of
her
faith
in
this
lost
man
,
that
her
husband
could
have
looked
at
her
as
she
was
for
hours
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
,
O
my
dearest
Love
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
urged
,
clinging
nearer
to
him
,
laying
her
head
upon
his
breast
,
and
raising
her
eyes
to
his
,
"
remember
how
strong
we
are
in
our
happiness
,
and
how
weak
he
is
in
his
misery
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
supplication
touched
him
home
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
always
remember
it
,
dear
Heart
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
remember
it
as
long
as
I
live
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
bent
over
the
golden
head
,
and
put
the
rosy
lips
to
his
,
and
folded
her
in
his
arms
.
 
<EOS>
If
one
forlorn
wanderer
then
pacing
the
dark
streets
,
could
have
heard
her
innocent
disclosure
,
and
could
have
seen
the
drops
of
pity
kissed
away
by
her
husband
from
the
soft
blue
eyes
so
loving
of
that
husband
,
he
might
have
cried
to
the
night
---
and
the
words
would
not
have
parted
from
his
lips
for
the
first
time
---
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
her
for
her
sweet
compassion
!

<EOS>
Echoing
Footsteps
 
<EOS>
A
wonderful
corner
for
echoes
<EOS>
,
it
has
been
remarked
,
that
corner
where
the
Doctor
lived
.
 
<EOS>
Ever
busily
winding
the
golden
thread
which
bound
her
husband
,
and
her
father
,
and
herself
,
and
her
old
directress
and
companion
,
in
a
life
of
quiet
bliss
,
Lucie
sat
in
the
still
house
in
the
tranquilly
resounding
corner
,
listening
to
the
echoing
footsteps
of
years
.
   
<EOS>
At
first
,
there
were
times
,
though
she
was
a
perfectly
happy
young
wife
,
when
her
work
would
slowly
fall
from
her
hands
,
and
her
eyes
would
be
dimmed
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
there
was
something
coming
in
the
echoes
,
something
light
,
afar
off
,
and
scarcely
audible
yet
,
that
stirred
her
heart
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
Fluttering
hopes
and
doubts
---
hopes
,
of
a
love
as
yet
unknown
to
her
:
 
<EOS>
doubts
,
of
her
remaining
upon
earth
,
to
enjoy
that
new
delight
---
divided
her
breast
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
echoes
then
,
there
would
arise
the
sound
of
footsteps
at
her
own
early
grave
;
and
thoughts
of
the
husband
who
would
be
left
so
desolate
,
and
who
would
mourn
for
her
so
much
,
swelled
to
her
eyes
,
and
broke
like
waves
.
   
<EOS>
That
time
passed
,
and
her
little
Lucie
lay
on
her
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
among
the
advancing
echoes
,
there
was
the
tread
of
her
tiny
feet
and
the
sound
of
her
prattling
words
.
 
<EOS>
Let
greater
echoes
resound
as
they
would
,
the
young
mother
at
the
cradle
side
could
always
hear
those
coming
.
 
<EOS>
They
came
,
and
the
shady
house
was
sunny
with
a
child
's
laugh
,
and
the
Divine
friend
of
children
,
to
whom
in
her
trouble
she
had
confided
hers
,
seemed
to
take
her
child
in
his
arms
,
as
He
took
the
child
of
old
,
and
made
it
a
sacred
joy
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
Ever
busily
winding
the
golden
thread
that
bound
them
all
together
,
weaving
the
service
of
her
happy
influence
through
the
tissue
of
all
their
lives
,
and
making
it
predominate
nowhere
,
Lucie
heard
in
the
echoes
of
years
none
but
friendly
and
soothing
sounds
.
 
<EOS>
Her
husband
's
step
was
strong
and
prosperous
among
them
;
her
father
's
firm
and
equal
.
<EOS>
Lo
,
Miss
Pross
,
in
harness
of
string
,
awakening
the
echoes
,
as
an
unruly
charger
,
whip
-
corrected
,
snorting
and
pawing
the
earth
under
the
plane
-
tree
in
the
garden
!
   
<EOS>
Even
when
there
were
sounds
of
sorrow
among
the
rest
,
they
were
not
harsh
nor
cruel
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
golden
hair
,
like
her
own
,
lay
in
a
halo
on
a
pillow
round
the
worn
face
of
a
little
boy
,
and
he
said
,
with
a
radiant
smile
,
"
Dear
papa
and
mamma
,
I
am
very
sorry
to
leave
you
both
,
and
to
leave
my
pretty
sister
;
but
I
am
called
,
and
I
must
go
!
"
<EOS>
those
were
not
tears
all
of
agony
that
wetted
his
young
mother
's
cheek
,
as
the
spirit
departed
from
her
embrace
that
had
been
entrusted
to
it
.
<EOS>
Suffer
them
and
forbid
them
not
.
 
<EOS>
They
see
my
Father
's
face
.
<EOS>
O
Father
,
blessed
words
!
   
<EOS>
Thus
,
the
rustling
of
an
Angel
's
wings
got
blended
with
the
other
echoes
,
and
they
were
not
wholly
of
earth
,
but
had
in
them
that
breath
of
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
Sighs
of
the
winds
that
blew
over
a
little
garden
-
tomb
were
mingled
with
them
also
,
and
both
were
audible
to
Lucie
,
in
a
hushed
murmur
---
like
the
breathing
of
a
summer
sea
asleep
upon
a
sandy
shore
 
---
as
the
little
Lucie
,
comically
studious
at
the
task
of
the
morning
,
or
dressing
a
doll
at
her
mother
's
footstool
,
chattered
in
the
tongues
of
the
Two
Cities
that
were
blended
in
her
life
.
   
<EOS>
The
Echoes
rarely
answered
to
the
actual
tread
of
Sydney
Carton
.
<EOS>
Some
half
-
dozen
times
a
year
,
at
most
,
he
claimed
his
privilege
of
coming
in
uninvited
,
and
would
sit
among
them
through
the
evening
,
as
he
had
once
done
often
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
came
there
heated
with
wine
.
 
<EOS>
And
one
other
thing
regarding
him
was
whispered
in
the
echoes
,
which
has
been
whispered
by
all
true
echoes
for
ages
and
ages
.
   
<EOS>
No
man
ever
really
loved
a
woman
,
lost
her
,
and
knew
her
with
a
blameless
though
an
unchanged
mind
,
when
she
was
a
wife
and
a
mother
,
but
her
children
had
a
strange
sympathy
with
him
---
an
instinctive
delicacy
of
pity
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
What
fine
hidden
sensibilities
are
touched
in
such
a
case
,
no
echoes
tell
;
but
it
is
so
,
and
it
was
so
here
.
<EOS>
Carton
was
the
first
stranger
to
whom
little
Lucie
held
out
her
chubby
arms
,
and
he
kept
his
place
with
her
as
she
grew
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
boy
had
spoken
of
him
,
almost
at
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Carton
!
 
<EOS>
Kiss
him
for
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Stryver
shouldered
his
way
through
the
law
,
like
some
great
engine
forcing
itself
through
turbid
water
,
and
dragged
his
useful
friend
in
his
wake
,
like
a
boat
towed
astern
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
boat
so
favoured
is
usually
in
a
rough
plight
,
and
mostly
under
water
,
so
,
Sydney
had
a
swamped
life
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
easy
and
strong
custom
,
unhappily
so
much
easier
and
stronger
in
him
than
any
stimulating
sense
of
desert
or
disgrace
,
made
it
the
life
he
was
to
lead
;
and
he
no
more
thought
of
emerging
from
his
state
of
lion
's
jackal
,
than
any
real
jackal
may
be
supposed
to
think
of
rising
to
be
a
lion
.
 
<EOS>
Stryver
was
rich
;
had
married
a
florid
widow
with
property
and
three
boys
,
who
had
nothing
particularly
shining
about
them
but
the
straight
hair
of
their
dumpling
heads
.
   
<EOS>
These
three
young
gentlemen
,
Mr
Stryver
,
exuding
patronage
of
the
most
offensive
quality
from
every
pore
,
had
walked
before
him
like
three
sheep
to
the
quiet
corner
in
Soho
,
and
had
offered
as
pupils
to
Lucie
's
husband
:
 
delicately
saying
"
Halloa
!
<EOS>
here
are
three
lumps
of
bread
-
and
-
cheese
towards
your
matrimonial
picnic
,
Darnay
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
polite
rejection
of
the
three
lumps
of
bread
-
and
-
cheese
had
quite
bloated
Mr
Stryver
with
indignation
,
which
he
afterwards
turned
to
account
in
the
training
of
the
young
gentlemen
,
by
directing
them
to
beware
of
the

He
was
also
in
the
habit
of
declaiming
to
Mrs
Stryver
,
over
his
full
-
bodied
wine
,
on

arts
Mrs
Darnay
had
once
put

practice
to
"

him

diamond
arts
in

which

rendered
him
"

<EOS>
"
Some
of
his
King
's
Bench
familiars
,
who
were
occasionally
parties
to
the
full
-
bodied
wine
and
the
lie
,
excused
him
for
the
latter
by
saying
that
he
had
told
it
so
often
,
that
he
believed
it
himself
---
which
is
surely
such
an
incorrigible
aggravation
of
an
originally
bad
offence
,
as
to
justify
any
such
offender
's
being
carried
off
to
some
suitably
retired
spot
,
and
there
hanged
out
of
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
These
were
among
the
echoes
to
which
<EOS>
Lucie
,
sometimes
pensive
,
sometimes
amused
and
laughing
,
listened
in
the
echoing
corner
,
until
her
little
daughter
was
six
years
old
.
 
<EOS>
How
near
to
her
heart
the
echoes
of
her
child
's
tread
came
,
and
those
of
her
own
dear
father
's
,
always
active
and
self
-
possessed
,
and
those
of
her
dear
husband
's
,
need
not
be
told
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
,
how
the
lightest
echo
of
their
united
home
,
directed
by
herself
with
such
a
wise
and
elegant
thrift
that
it
was
more
abundant
than
any
waste
,
was
music
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
,
how
there
were
echoes
all
about
her
,
sweet
in
her
ears
,
of
the
many
times
<EOS>
her
father
had
told
her
that
he
found
her
more
devoted
to
him
married
(
if
that
could
be
)
than
single
,
and
of
the
many
times
her
husband
had
said
to
her
that
no
cares
and
duties
seemed
to
divide
her
love
for
him
or
her
help
to
him
,
and
asked
her
"
What
is
the
magic
secret
,
my
darling
,
of
your
being
everything
to
all
of
us
,
as
if
there
were
only
one
of
us
,
yet
never
seeming
to
be
hurried
,
or
to
have
too
much
to
do
?
"
   
<EOS>
But
,
there
were
other
echoes
,
from
a
distance
,
that
rumbled
menacingly
in
the
corner
all
through
this
space
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
was
now
,
about
little
Lucie
's
sixth
birthday
,
that
they
began
to
have
an
awful
sound
,
as
of
a
great
storm
in
France
with
a
dreadful
sea
rising
.
   
<EOS>
On
a
night
in
mid
-
July
,
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
eighty
-
nine
,
Mr
Lorry
came
in
late
,
from
Tellson
's
,
and
sat
himself
down
by
Lucie
and
her
husband
in
the
dark
window
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
hot
,
wild
night
,
and
they
were
all
three
reminded
of
the
old
Sunday
night
when
they
had
looked
at
the
lightning
from
the
same
place
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
began
to
think
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
pushing
his
brown
wig
back
,
"
that
I
should
have
to
pass
the
night
at
Tellson
's
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
been
so
full
of
business
all
day
,
that
we
have
not
known
what
to
do
first
,
or
which
way
to
turn
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
such
an
uneasiness
in
Paris
,
that
we
have
actually
a
run
of
confidence
upon
us
!
 
<EOS>
Our
customers
over
there
,
seem
not
to
be
able
to
confide
their
property
to
us
fast
enough
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
positively
a
mania
among
some
of
them
for
sending
it
to
England
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
has
a
bad
look
,
"
said
Darnay
---
   
<EOS>
"
A
bad
look
,
you
say
,
my
dear
Darnay
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
we
do
n't
know
what
reason
there
is
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
People
are
so
unreasonable
!
 
<EOS>
Some
of
us
at
Tellson
's
are
getting
old
,
and
we
really
ca
n't
be
troubled
out
of
the
ordinary
course
without
due
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Still
,
"
said
Darnay
,
"
you
know
how
gloomy
and
threatening
the
sky
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
,
to
be
sure
,
"
assented
Mr
Lorry
,
trying
to
persuade
himself
that
his
sweet
temper
was
soured
,
and
that
he
grumbled
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
am
determined
to
be
peevish
after
my
long
day
's
botheration

<EOS>
Where

"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
he
is

said
the
Doctor
,
entering
the
dark

at
the
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
glad
you
are

for

surrounded
all

made

<EOS>
You

"
   
<EOS>
"
No

I
am
going

I

I
do
n't

why
anything
should
be
otherwise

Now
,
come
and
take
your
place
in
the
circle
,
and
let
us
sit
quiet
,
and
hear
the
echoes
about
which
you
have
your
theory
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
theory
;
it
was
a
fancy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
fancy
,
then
,
my
wise
pet
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
patting
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
very
numerous
and
very
loud
,
though

are

not
?
 
<EOS>
Only

"
   
<EOS>
Headlong
,
mad
,
and
dangerous
footsteps
to
force
their
way
into
anybody
's
life
,
footsteps
not
easily
made
clean
again
if
once
stained
red
,
the
footsteps
raging
in
Saint
Antoine
afar
off
,
as
the
little
circle
sat
in
the
dark
London
window
.
   
<EOS>
Saint
Antoine
had
been
,
that
morning
,
a
vast
dusky
mass
of
scarecrows
heaving
to
and
fro
,
with
frequent
gleams
of
light
above
the
billowy
heads
,
where
steel
blades
and
bayonets
shone
in
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
A
tremendous
roar
arose
from
the
throat
of
Saint
Antoine
,
and
a
forest
of
naked
arms
struggled
in
the
air
like
shrivelled
branches
of
trees
in
a
winter
wind
:
all
the
fingers
convulsively
clutching
at
every
weapon
or
semblance
of
a
weapon
that
was
thrown
up
from
the
depths
below
,
no
matter
how
far
off
.
   
<EOS>
Who
gave
them
out
,
whence
they
last
came
,
where
they
began
,
through
what
agency
they
crookedly
quivered
and
jerked
,
scores
at
a
time
,
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
,
like
a
kind
of
lightning
,
no
eye
in
the
throng
could
have
told
;
but
,
muskets
were
being
distributed
---
so
were
cartridges
,
powder
,
and
ball
,
bars
of
iron
and
wood
,
knives
,
axes
,
pikes
,
every
weapon
that
distracted
ingenuity
could
discover
or
devise
.
<EOS>
People
who
could
lay
hold
of
nothing
else
,
set
themselves
with
bleeding
hands
to
force
stones
and
bricks
out
of
their
places
in
walls
.
 
<EOS>
Every
pulse
and
heart
in
Saint
Antoine
was
on
high
-
fever
strain
and
at
high
-
fever
heat
.
 
<EOS>
Every
living
creature
there
held
life
as
of
no
account
,
and
was
demented
with
a
passionate
readiness
to
sacrifice
it
.
   
<EOS>
As
a
whirlpool
of
boiling
waters
has
a
centre
point
,
so
,
all
this
raging
circled
round
Defarge
's
wine
-
shop
,
and
every
human
drop
in
the
caldron
had
a
tendency
to
be
sucked
towards
the
vortex
where
Defarge
himself
,
already
begrimed
with
gunpowder
and
sweat
,
issued
orders
,
issued
arms
,
thrust
this
man
back
,
dragged
this
man
forward
,
disarmed
one
to
arm
another
,
laboured
and
strove
in
the
thickest
of
the
uproar
.

"

said
madame

composed
as
ever
,
but
not
knitting
to

day

<EOS>
Madame

resolute
right
hand
was
occupied
with
an
axe
,
in
place
of
the
usual
softer
implements
,
and
in
her
girdle
were
a

"
Where

With

the

The

Does
it

a

you

croaked
Jacques
Three
,
who
had
come
close
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
Monsieur

it
is
a
cell

it

Pass

<EOS>
Jacques
Three
,
with
his
usual
craving
on
him
,
and
evidently
disappointed
by
the
dialogue
taking
a
turn
that
did
not
seem
to
promise
bloodshed
,
held
by
Defarge
's
arm
as
he
held
by
the
turnkey
's
.
 
<EOS>
Their
three
heads
had
been
close
together
during
this
brief
discourse
,
and
it
had
been
as
much
as
they
could
do
to
hear
one
another
,
even
then
:
<EOS>
so
tremendous
was
the
noise
of
the
living
ocean
,
in
its
irruption
into
the
Fortress
,
and
its
inundation
of
the
courts
and
passages
and
staircases
.
 
<EOS>
All
around
outside
,
too
,
it
beat
the
walls
with
a
deep
,
hoarse
roar
,
from
which
,
occasionally
,
some
partial
shouts
of
tumult
broke
and
leaped
into
the
air
like
spray
.
   
<EOS>
Through
gloomy
vaults
where
the
light
of
day
had
never
shone
,
past
hideous
doors
of
dark
dens
and
cages
,
down
cavernous
flights
of
steps
,
and
again
up
steep
rugged
ascents
of
stone
and
brick
,
more
like
dry
waterfalls
than
staircases
,
Defarge
,
the
turnkey
,
and
Jacques
Three
,
linked
hand
and
arm
,
went
with
all
the
speed
they
could
make
.
 
<EOS>
Here
and
there
,
especially
at
first
,
the
inundation
started
on
them
and
swept
by
;
but
when
they
had
done
descending
,
and
were
winding
and
climbing
up
a
tower
,
they
were
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Hemmed
in
here
by
the
massive
thickness
of
walls
and
arches
,
the
storm
within
the
fortress
and
without
was
only
audible
to
them
in
a
dull
,
subdued
way
,
as
if
the
noise
out
of
which
they
had
come
had
almost
destroyed
their
sense
of
hearing
.
   
<EOS>
The
turnkey
stopped
at
a
low
door
,
put
a
key
in
a
clashing
lock
,
swung
the
door
slowly
open
,
and
said
,
as
they
all
bent
their
heads
and
passed
in
:
   
"
One
hundred
and
five
,
North
Tower
!
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
small
,
heavily
-
grated
,
unglazed
window
high
in
the
wall
,
with
a
stone
screen
before
it
,
so
that
the
sky
could
be
only
seen
by
stooping
low
and
looking
up
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
small
chimney
,
heavily
barred
across
,
a
few
feet
within
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
heap
of
old
feathery
wood
-
ashes
on
the
hearth
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
stool
,
and
table
,
and
a
straw
bed
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
the
four
blackened
walls
,
and
a
rusted
iron
ring
in
one
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pass
that
torch
slowly
along
these
walls
,
that
I
may
see
them
,
"
said
Defarge
to
the
turnkey
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
obeyed
,
and
Defarge
followed
the
light
closely
with
his
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
<EOS>
---
Look
here
,
Jacques
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
A^
M^

"
croaked
Jacques
Three
,
as
he
read
greedily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Alexandre
Manette
,
"
said
Defarge
in
his
ear
,
following
the
letters
with
his
swart
forefinger
,
deeply
engrained
with
gunpowder
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
here
he
wrote
"
a
poor
physician
.
"
<EOS>
And
it
was
he
,
without
doubt
,
who
scratched
a
calendar
on
this
stone
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
that
in
your
hand
?
 
<EOS>
A
crowbar
?
<EOS>
Give
it
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
still
the
linstock
of
his
gun
in
his
own
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
a
sudden
exchange
of
the
two
instruments
,
and
turning
on
the
worm
-
eaten
stool
and
table
,
beat
them
to
pieces
in
a
few
blows
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hold
the
light
higher
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
wrathfully
,
to
the
turnkey
.
"
<EOS>
Look
among
those
fragments
with
care
,
Jacques
.
 
<EOS>
And
see
!
 
<EOS>
Here
is
my
knife
,
"
throwing
it
to
him
;
"
rip
open
that
bed
,
and
search
the
straw
.
<EOS>
Hold
the
light
higher
,
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
a
menacing
look
at
the
turnkey
he
crawled
upon
the
hearth
,
and
,
peering
up
the
chimney
,
struck
and
prised
at
its
sides
with
the
crowbar
,
and
worked
at
the
iron
grating
across
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
,
some
mortar
and
dust
came
dropping
down
,
which
he
averted
his
face
to
avoid
;
and
in
it
,
and
in
the
old
wood
-
ashes
,
and
in
a
crevice
in
the
chimney
into
which
his
weapon
had
slipped
or
wrought
itself
,
he
groped
with
a
cautious
touch
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
in
the
wood
,
and
nothing
in
the
straw
,
Jacques
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
us
collect
them
together
,
in
the
middle
of
the
cell
.
 
<EOS>
So
!
<EOS>
Light
them
,
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
turnkey
fired
the
little
pile
,
which
blazed
high
and
hot
.
 
<EOS>
Stooping
again
to
come
out
at
the
low
-
arched
door
,
they
left
it
burning
,
and
retraced
their
way
to
the
courtyard
;
seeming
to
recover
their
sense
of
hearing
as
they
came
down
,
until
they
were
in
the
raging
flood
once
more
.
   
<EOS>
They
found
it
surging
and
tossing
,
in
quest
of
Defarge
himself
.
<EOS>
Saint
Antoine
was
clamorous
to
have
its
wine
-
shop
keeper
foremost
in
the
guard
upon
the
governor
who
had
defended
the
Bastille
and
shot
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
the
governor
would
not
be
marched
to
the
Hotel
de
Ville
for
judgment
.
 
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
the
governor
would
escape
,
and
the
people
's
blood
(
suddenly
of
some
value
,
after
many
years
of
worthlessness
)
be
unavenged
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
howling
universe
of
passion
and
contention
that
seemed
to
encompass
this
grim
old
officer
conspicuous
in
his
grey
coat
and
red
decoration
,
there
was
but
one
quite
steady
figure
,
and
that
was
a
woman
's
.
 
<EOS>
"
See
,
there
is
my
husband
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
pointing
him
out
.
"
<EOS>
See
Defarge
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
stood
immovable
close
to
the
grain
old
officer
,
and
remained
immovable
close
to
him
;
remained
immovable
close
to
him
through
the
streets
,
as
Defarge
and
the
rest
bore
him
along
;
remained
immovable
close
to
him
when
he
was
got
near
his
destination
,
and
began
to
be
struck
at
from
behind
;
remained
immovable
close
to
him
when
the
long
-
gathering
rain
of
stabs
and
blows
fell
heavy
;
was
so
close
to
him
when
he
dropped
dead
under
it
,
that
,
suddenly
animated
,
she
put
her
foot
upon
his
neck
,
and
with
her
cruel
knife
---
long
ready
<EOS>
---
hewed
off
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
The
hour
was
come
,
when
Saint
Antoine
was
to
execute
his
horrible
idea
of
hoisting
up
men
for
lamps
to
show
what
he
could
be
and
do
.
 
<EOS>
Saint
Antoine
's
blood
was
up
,
and
the
blood
of
tyranny
and
domination
by
the
iron
hand
was
down
---
down
on
the
steps
of
the
Hotel
de
Ville
where
the
governor
's
body
lay
---
down
on
the
sole
of
the
shoe
of
Madame
Defarge
where
she
had
trodden
on
the
body
to
steady
it
for
mutilation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lower
the
lamp
yonder
!
"
cried
Saint
Antoine
,
after
glaring
round
for
a
new
means
of
death
;
"
here
is
one
of
his
soldiers
to
be
left
on
guard
!
"
<EOS>
The
swinging
sentinel
was
posted
,
and
the
sea
rushed
on
.
   
<EOS>
The
sea
of
black
and
threatening
waters
,
and
of
destructive
upheaving
of
wave
against
wave
,
whose
depths
were
yet
unfathomed
and
whose
forces
were
yet
unknown
.
 
<EOS>
The
remorseless
sea
of
turbulently
swaying
shapes
,
voices
of
vengeance
,
and
faces
hardened
in
the
furnaces
of
suffering
until
the
touch
of
pity
could
make
no
mark
on
them
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
ocean
of
faces
where
every
fierce
and
furious
expression
was
in
vivid
life
,
there
were
two
groups
of
faces
---
each
seven
in
number
 
---
<EOS>
so
fixedly
contrasting
with
the
rest
,
that
never
did
sea
roll
which
bore
more
memorable
wrecks
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Seven
faces
of
prisoners
,
suddenly
released
by
the
storm
that
had
burst
their
tomb
,
were
carried
high
overhead
:
 
all
scared
,
all
lost
,
all
wondering
and
amazed
,
as
if
the
Last
Day
were
come
,
and
those
who
rejoiced
around
them
were
lost
spirits
.
<EOS>
Other
seven
faces
there
were
,
carried
higher
,
seven
dead
faces
,
whose
drooping
eyelids
and
half
-
seen
eyes
awaited
the
Last
Day
.
 
<EOS>
Impassive
faces
,
yet
with
a
suspended
---
not
an
abolished
---
expression
on
them
;
faces
,
rather
,
in
a
fearful
pause
,
as
having
yet
to
raise
the
dropped
lids
of
the
eyes
,
and
bear
witness
with
the
bloodless
lips
,
"
THOU
DIDST
IT
!
"
   
<EOS>
Seven
prisoners
released
,
seven
gory
heads
on
pikes
,
the
keys
of
the
accursed
fortress
of
the
eight
strong
towers
,
some
discovered
letters
and
other
memorials
of
prisoners
of
old
time
,
long
dead
of
broken
hearts
,
---
such
,
and
such
---
like
,
the
loudly
echoing
footsteps
of
Saint
Antoine
escort
through
the
Paris
streets
in
mid
-
July
,
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
eighty

nine

<EOS>
Now
,
Heaven
defeat
the
fancy
of
Lucie
Darnay
,
and
keep
these
feet
far
out
of
her
life
!
 
<EOS>
For
,
they
are
headlong
,
mad
,
and
dangerous
;
and
in
the
years
so
long
after
the
breaking
of
the
cask
at
Defarge
's
wine
-
shop
door
,
they
are
not
easily
purified
when

The
Sea
Still
Rises
 
Haggard
Saint
Antoine
had
had
only
one
exultant
week
,
in
which
to
soften
his
modicum
of
hard
and
bitter
bread
to
such
extent
as
he
could
,
with
the
relish
of
fraternal
embraces
and
congratulations
,
when
Madame
Defarge
sat
at
her
counter
,
as
usual
,
presiding
over
the
customers
.
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
wore
no
rose
in
her
head
,
for
the
great
brotherhood
of
Spies
had
become
,
even
in
one
short
week
,
extremely
chary
of
trusting
themselves
to
the
saint
's
mercies
.
 
<EOS>
The
lamps
across
his
streets
had
a
portentously
elastic
swing
with
them
.
   
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
,
with
her
arms
folded
,
sat
in
the
morning
light
and
heat
,
contemplating
the
wine
-
shop
and
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
In
both
,
there
were
several
knots
of
loungers
,
squalid
and
miserable
,
but
now
with
a
manifest
sense
of
power
enthroned
on
their
distress
.
 
<EOS>
The
raggedest
nightcap
,
awry
on
the
wretchedest
head
,
had
this
crooked
significance
in
it
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
how
hard
it
has
grown
for
me
,
the
wearer
of
this
,
to
support
life
in
myself
;
but
do
you
know
how
easy
it
has
grown
for
me
,
the
wearer
of
this
,
to
destroy
life
in
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
Every
lean
bare
arm
,
that
bad
been
without
work
before
,
had
this
work
always
ready
for
it
now
,
that
it
could
strike
.
<EOS>
The
fingers
of
the
knitting
women
were
vicious
,
with
the
experience
that
they
could
tear
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
change
in
the
appearance
of
Saint
Antoine
;
the
image
had
been
hammering
into
this
for
hundreds
of
years
,
and
the
last
finishing
blows
had
told
mightily
on
the
expression
.
   
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
sat
observing
it
,
with
such
suppressed
approval
as
was
to
be
desired
in
the
leader
of
the
Saint
Antoine
women
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
her
sisterhood
knitted
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
short
,
rather
plump
wife
of
a
starved
grocer
,
and
the
mother
of
two
children
withal
,
this
lieutenant
had
already
earned
the
complimentary
name
of
The
Vengeance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
"
said
The
Vengeance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Listen
,
then
!
 
<EOS>
Who
comes
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
if
a
train
of
powder
laid
from
the
outermost
bound
of
Saint
Antoine
Quarter
to
the
wine
-
shop
door
,
had
been
suddenly
fired
,
a
fast

spreading
murmur
came
rushing
along
.
   
<EOS>
"
It

Defarge

said
madame
.
 
<EOS>
"
Silence

<EOS>
Defarge
came
in
breathless
,
pulled
off
a
red

he
wore
,
and
looked
around
him
!

"
Listen

"
<EOS>
said
madame
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Listen
to

<EOS>
Defarge
stood
,
panting
,
against
a
background
of
eager
eyes
and
open
mouths
,
<EOS>
formed
outside
the
door
;
all
those
within
the
wine
-
shop
had
sprung
to
their
feet
.
   
<EOS>
"
Say

cried

contemptuously
.

<EOS>
"
Does
everybody
here
recall
old
Foulon

famished
people

they
might
eat
grass

and
who
died

went

Everybody

Not

He
feared
us
so
much

with
reason

that
he
caused
himself
to
be
represented
as
dead

had
a
grand
mock

But
they
have
found
him
alive

hiding
in
the
country

have
brought
him
in

I
have
seen
him

now
,
on
his
way
to
the
Hotel

a

of
more
than
threescore
years
and
ten
,
if
he
had
never
known
it
yet
,
he
would
have
known
it
in
his
heart
of
hearts
if
he
could
have
heard
the
answering
cry
.
   
<EOS>
A
moment
of
profound
silence
followed
.
 
<EOS>
Defarge
and
his
wife
looked
steadfastly
at
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
The
Vengeance
stooped
,
and
the
jar
of
a
drum
was
heard
as
she
moved
it
at
her
feet
behind
the
counter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Patriots
!
<EOS>
"
said
Defarge
,
in
a
determined
voice
,
"
are
we
ready
?
"
   
<EOS>
Instantly
Madame
Defarge
's
knife
was
in
her
girdle
;
the
drum
was
beating
in
the
streets
,
as
if
it
and
a
drummer
had
flown
together
by
magic
;
and
The
Vengeance
,
uttering
terrific
shrieks
,
and
flinging
her
arms
about
her
head
like
all
the
forty
Furies
at
once
,
was
tearing
from
house
to
house
,
rousing
the
women
.
   
<EOS>
The
men
were
terrible
,
in
the
bloody
-
minded
anger
with
which
they
looked
from
windows
,
caught
up
what
arms
they
had
,
and
came
pouring
down
into
the
streets
;
but
,
the
women
were
a
sight
to
chill
the
boldest
.
 
<EOS>
From
such
household
occupations
as
their
bare
poverty
yielded
,
from
their
children
,
from
their
aged
and
their
sick
crouching
on
the
bare
ground
famished
and
naked
,
they
ran
out
with
streaming
hair
,
urging
one
another
,
and
themselves
,
to
madness
with
the
wildest
cries
and
actions
.
<EOS>
Villain
Foulon
taken
,
my
sister
!
 
<EOS>
Old
Foulon
taken
,
my
mother
!
<EOS>
Miscreant
Foulon
taken
,
my
daughter
!
 
<EOS>
Then
,
a
score
of
others
ran
into
the
midst
of
these
,
beating
their
breasts
,
tearing
their
hair
,
and
screaming
,
<EOS>
Foulon
alive
!
 
<EOS>
Foulon
who
told
the
starving
people
they
might
eat
grass
!
 
<EOS>
Foulon
who
told
my
old
father
that
he
might
eat
grass
,
when
I
had
no
bread
to
give
him
!
 
<EOS>
Foulon
who
told
my
baby
it
might
suck
grass
,
when
these
breasts
where
dry
with
want
!
 
<EOS>
O
mother
of
God
,
this
Foulon
!
 
<EOS>
O
Heaven
our
suffering
!
 
<EOS>
Hear
me
,
<EOS>
my
dead
baby
and
my
withered
father
:
 
<EOS>
I
swear
on
my
knees
,
on
these
stones
,
to
avenge
you
on
Foulon
!
 
<EOS>
Husbands
,
and
brothers
,
and
young
men
,
Give
us
the
blood
of
Foulon
,
Give
us
the
head
of
Foulon
,
Give
us
the
heart
of
Foulon
,
Give
us
the
body
and
soul
of
Foulon
,
Rend
Foulon
to
pieces
,
and
dig
him
into
the
ground
,
that
grass
may
grow
from
him
!
 
<EOS>
With
these
cries
,
numbers
of
the
women
,
lashed
into
blind
frenzy
,
whirled
about
,
striking
and
tearing
at
their
own
friends
until
they
dropped
into
a
passionate
swoon
,
and
were
only
saved
by
the
men
belonging
to
them
from
being
trampled
under
foot
.
   
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
not
a
moment
was
lost
;
not
a
moment
!
 
<EOS>
This
Foulon
was
at
the
Hotel
de
Ville
,
and
might
be
loosed
.
 
<EOS>
Never
,
if
Saint
Antoine
knew
his
own
sufferings
,
insults
,
and
wrongs
!
 
<EOS>
Armed
men
and
women
flocked
out
of
the
Quarter
so
fast
,
and
drew
even
these
last
dregs
after
them
with
such
a
force
of
suction
,
that
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
there
was
not
a
human
creature
in
Saint
Antoine
's
bosom
but
a
few
old
crones
and
the
wailing
children
.
   
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
by
that
time
choking
the
Hall
of
Examination
where
this
old
man
,
ugly
and
wicked
,
was
,
and
overflowing
into
the
adjacent
open
space
and
streets
.
 
<EOS>
The
Defarges
,
husband
and
wife
,
The
Vengeance
,
and
Jacques
Three
,
were
in
the
first
press
,
and
at
no
great
distance
from
him
in
the
Hall
.
   
<EOS>
"
See
!
"
<EOS>
cried
madame
,
pointing
with
her
knife
.
 
<EOS>
"
See
the
old
villain
bound
with
ropes
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
well
done
to
tie
a
bunch
of
grass
upon
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
That
was
well
done
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
eat
it
now
!
"
 
<EOS>
Madame
put
her
knife
under
her
arm
,
and
clapped
her
hands
as
at
a
play
.
   
<EOS>
The
people
immediately
behind
Madame
Defarge
,
explaining
the
cause
of
her
satisfaction
to
those
behind
them
,
and
those
again
explaining
to
others
,
and
those
to
others
,
the
neighbouring
streets
resounded
with
the
clapping
of
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Similarly
,
during
two
or
three
hours
of
drawl
,
and
the
winnowing
of
many
bushels
of
words
,
Madame
Defarge
's
frequent
expressions
of
impatience
were
taken
up
,
with
marvellous
quickness
,
at
a
distance
:
 
the
more
readily
,
because
certain
men
who
had
by
some
wonderful
exercise
of
agility
climbed
up
the
external
architecture
to
look
in
from
the
windows
,
knew
Madame
Defarge
well
,
and
acted
as
a
telegraph
between
her
and
the
crowd
outside
the
building
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
the
sun
rose
so
high
that
it
struck
a
kindly
ray
as
of
hope
or
protection
,
directly
down
upon
the
old
prisoner
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
The
favour
was
too
much
to
bear
;
in
an
instant
the
barrier
of
dust
and
chaff
that
had
stood
surprisingly
long
,
went
to
the
winds
,
and
Saint
Antoine
had
got
him
!
   
<EOS>
It
was
known
directly
,
to
the
furthest
confines
of
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
Defarge
had
but
sprung
over
a
railing
and
a
table
,
and
folded
the
miserable
wretch
in
a
deadly
embrace
---
Madame
Defarge
had
but
followed
and
turned
her
hand
in
one
of
the
ropes
with
which
he
was
tied
---
<EOS>
The
Vengeance
and
Jacques
Three
were
not
yet
up
with
them
,
and
the
men
at
the
windows
had
not
yet
swooped
into
the
Hall
,
like
birds
of
prey
from
their
high
perches
---
when
the
cry
seemed
to
go
up
,
all
over
the
city
,
"
Bring
him
out
!
 
<EOS>
Bring
him
to
the
lamp
!
"
   
<EOS>
Down
,
and
up
,
and
head
foremost
on
the
steps
of
the
building
<EOS>
;
now
,
on
his
knees
;
now
,
on
his
feet
;
now
,
on
his
back
;
dragged
,
and
struck
at
,
and
stifled
by
the
bunches
of
grass
and
straw
that
were
thrust
into
his
face
by
hundreds
of
hands
;
torn
,
bruised
,
panting
,
bleeding
,
yet
always
entreating
and
beseeching
for
mercy
;
now
full
of
vehement
agony
of
action
,
with
a
small
clear
space
about
him
as
the
people
drew
one
another
back
that
they
might
see
;
now
,
a
log
of
dead
wood
drawn
through
a
forest
of
legs
;
he
was
hauled
to
the
nearest
street
corner
where
one
of
the
fatal
lamps
swung
,
and
there
Madame
Defarge
let
him
go
---
<EOS>
as
a
cat
might
have
done
to
a
mouse
---
and
silently
and
composedly
looked
at
him
while
they
made
ready
,
and
while
he
besought
her
:
 
<EOS>
the
women
passionately
screeching
at
him
all
the
time
,
and
the
men
sternly
calling
out
to
have
him
killed
with
grass
in
his
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
Once
,
he
went
aloft
,
and
the
rope
broke
,
and
they
caught
him
shrieking
;
twice
,
he
went
aloft
,
and
the
rope
broke
,
and
they
caught
him
shrieking
;
then
,
the
rope
was
merciful
,
and
held
him
,
and
his
head
was
soon
upon
a
pike
,
with
grass
enough
in
the
mouth
for
all
Saint
Antoine
to
dance
at
the
sight
of
.
   
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
the
end
of
the
day
's
bad
work
,
for
Saint
Antoine
<EOS>
so
shouted
and
danced
his
angry
blood
up
,
that
it
boiled
again
,
on
hearing
when
the
day
closed
in
that
the
son
-
in
-
law
of
the
despatched
,
another
of
the
people
's
enemies
and
insulters
,
was
coming
into
Paris
under
a
guard
five
hundred
strong
,
in
cavalry
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Saint
Antoine
wrote
his
crimes
on
flaring
sheets
of
paper
,
seized
him
---
would
have
torn
him
out
of
the
breast
of
an
army
to
bear
Foulon
company
---
set
his
head
and
heart
on
pikes
,
and
carried
the
three
spoils
of
the
day
,
in
Wolf
-
procession
through
the
streets
.
   
<EOS>
Not
before
dark
night
did
the
men
and
women
come
back
to
the
children
,
wailing
and
breadless
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
miserable
bakers
'
shops
were
beset
by
long
files
of
them
,
patiently
waiting
to
buy
bad
bread
;
and
while
they
waited
with
stomachs
faint
and
empty
,
they
beguiled
the
time
by
embracing
one
another
on
the
triumphs
of
the
day
,
and
achieving
them
again
in
gossip
.
 
<EOS>
Gradually
,
these
strings
of
ragged
people
shortened
and
frayed
away
;
and
then
poor
lights
began
to
shine
in
high
windows
,
and
slender
fires
were
made
in
the
streets
,
at
which
neighbours
cooked
in
common
,
afterwards
supping
at
their
doors
.
   
<EOS>
Scanty
and
insufficient
suppers
those
,
and
innocent
of
meat
,
as
of
most
other
sauce
to
wretched
bread
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
human
fellowship
infused
some
nourishment
into
the
flinty
viands
,
and
struck
some
sparks
of
cheerfulness
out
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
Fathers
and
mothers
who
had
had
their
full
share
in
the
worst
of
the
day
,
played
gently
with
their
meagre
children
;
and
lovers
,
with
such
a
world
around
them
and
before
them
,
loved
and
hoped
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
almost
morning
,
when
Defarge
's
wine
-
shop
parted
with
its
last
knot
of
customers
,
and
Monsieur
Defarge
said
to
madame
his
wife
,
in
husky
tones
,
while
fastening
the
door
:
   
<EOS>
"
At
last
it
is
come
,
my
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Eh
well
!
"
returned
madame
.
 
<EOS>
"
Almost
.

<EOS>
Saint
Antoine
slept
,
the
Defarges
slept
:
 
even
The
Vengeance
slept
with
her
starved
grocer
,
and
the
drum
was
at
rest
.
 
<EOS>
The
drum
's
was
the
only
voice
in
Saint
Antoine
that
blood
and
hurry
had
not
changed
.
 
<EOS>
The
Vengeance
,
as
custodian
of
the
drum
,
could
have
wakened
him
up
and
had
the
same
speech
out
of
him
as
before
the
Bastille
fell
,
or
old
Foulon
was
seized
;
not
so
with
the
hoarse
tones
of
the
men
and
women
in
Saint
Antoine
's
bosom
.

Fire
Rises
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
change
on
the
village
where
the
fountain
fell
,
and
where
the
mender
of
roads
went
forth
daily
to
hammer
out
of
the
stones
on
the
highway
such
morsels
of
bread
as
might
serve
for
patches
to
hold
his
poor
ignorant
soul
and
his
poor
reduced
body
together
.
 
<EOS>
The
prison
on
the
crag
was
not
so
dominant
as
of
yore
;
there
were
soldiers
to
guard
it
,
but
not
many
;
there
were
officers
to
guard
the
soldiers
,
but
not
one
of
them
knew
what
his
men
would
do
---
beyond
this
:
 
that
it
would
probably
not
be
what
he
was
ordered
.
   
<EOS>
Far
and
wide
lay
a
ruined
country
,
yielding
nothing
but
desolation
.
<EOS>
Every
green
leaf
,
every
blade
of
grass
and
blade
of
grain
,
was
as
shrivelled
and
poor
as
the
miserable
people
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
was
bowed
down
,
dejected
,
oppressed
,
and
broken
.
 
<EOS>
Habitations
,
fences
,
domesticated
animals
,
men
,
women
,
children
,
and
the
soil
that
bore
them
---
all
worn
out
.
   
<EOS>
Monseigneur
(
often
a
most
worthy
individual
gentleman
)
was
a
national
blessing
,
gave
a
chivalrous
tone
to
things
,
was
a
polite
example
of
luxurious
and
shining
fife
,
and
a
great
deal
more
to
equal
purpose
;
nevertheless
,
Monseigneur
as
a
class
had
,
somehow
or
other
,
brought
things
to
this
.
 
<EOS>
Strange
<EOS>
that
Creation
,
designed
expressly
for
Monseigneur
,
should
be
so
soon
wrung
dry
and
squeezed
out
!
 
<EOS>
There
must
be
something
short
-
sighted
in
the
eternal
arrangements
,
surely
!
 
<EOS>
Thus
it
was
,
however
;
and
the
last
drop
of
blood
having
been
extracted
from
the
flints
,
and
the
last
screw
of
the
rack
having
been
turned
so
often
that
its
purchase
crumbled
,
and
it
now
turned
and
turned
with
nothing
to
bite
,
Monseigneur
began
to
run
away
from
a
phenomenon
so
low
and
unaccountable
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
this
was
not
the
change
on
the
village
,
and
on
many
a
village
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
For
scores
of
years
gone
by
,
Monseigneur
had
squeezed
it
and
wrung
it
,
and
had
seldom
graced
it
with
his
presence
except
for
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
---
now
,
found
in
hunting
the
people
;
now
,
found
in
hunting
the
beasts
,
for
whose
preservation
Monseigneur
made
edifying
spaces
of
barbarous
and
barren
wilderness
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
The
change
consisted
in
the
appearance
of
strange
faces
of
low
caste
,
rather
than
in
the
disappearance
of
the
high
caste
,
chiselled
,
and
otherwise
beautified
and
beautifying
features
of
Monseigneur
.
   
<EOS>
For
,
in
these
times
,
as
the
mender
of
roads
worked
,
solitary
,
in
the
dust
,
not
often
troubling
himself
to
reflect
that
dust
he
was
and
to
dust
he
must
return
,
being
for
the
most
part
too
much
occupied
in
thinking
how
little
he
had
for
supper
and
how
much
more
he
would
eat
if
he
had
it
---
in
these
times
,
as
he
raised
his
eyes
from
his
lonely
labour
,
and
viewed
the
prospect
,
he
would
see
some
rough
figure
approaching
on
foot
,
the
like
of
which
was
once
a
rarity
in
those
parts
,
but
was
now
a
frequent
presence
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
advanced
,
the
mender
of
roads
would
discern
without
surprise
,
that
it
was
a
shaggy
-
haired
man
,
of
almost
barbarian
aspect
,
tall
,
in
wooden
shoes
that
were
clumsy
even
to
the
eyes
of
a
mender
of
roads
,
grim
,
rough
,
swart
,
steeped
in
the
mud
and
dust
of
many
highways
,
dank
with
the
marshy
moisture
of
many
low
grounds
,
sprinkled
with
the
thorns
and
leaves
and
moss
of
many
byways
through
woods
.
   
<EOS>
Such
a
man
came
upon
him
,
like
a
ghost
,
at
noon
in
the
July
weather
,
as
he
sat
on
his
heap
of
stones
under
a
bank
,
taking
such
shelter
as
he
could
get
from
a
shower
of
hail
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
looked
at
him
,
looked
at
the
village
in
the
hollow
,
at
the
mill
,
and
at
the
prison
on
the
crag
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
identified
these
objects
in
<EOS>
what
benighted
mind
he
had
,
he
said
,
in
a
dialect
that
was
just
intelligible
:
   
<EOS>
"
How
goes
it
,
Jacques
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
well
,
Jacques
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Touch
then
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
joined
hands
,
and
the
man
sat
down
on
the
heap
of
stones
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
dinner
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
but
supper
now
,
"
said
the
mender
of
roads
,
with
a
hungry
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
fashion
,
"
growled
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
meet
no
dinner
anywhere
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
took
out
a
blackened
pipe
,
filled
it
,
lighted
it
with
flint
and
steel
,
pulled
at
it
until
it
was
in
a
bright
glow
:
 
then
,
suddenly
held
it
from
him
and
dropped
something
into
it
from
between
his
finger
and
thumb
,
that
blazed
and
went
out
in
a
puff
of
smoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
Touch
then
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
turn
of
the
mender
of
roads
to
say
it
this
time
,
after
observing
these
operations
.
 
<EOS>
They
again
joined
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
-
night
?
"
said
the
mender
of
roads
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
-
night
,
"
said
the
man
,
putting
the
pipe
in
his
mouth
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
?
"
   
"
Here
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
and
the
mender
of
roads
sat
on
the
heap
of
stones
looking
silently
at
one
another
,
with
the
hail
driving
in
between
them
like
a
pigmy
charge
of
bayonets
,
until
the
sky
began
to
clear
over
the
village
.
   
<EOS>
"
Show
me
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
traveller
then
,
moving
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
.
   
<EOS>
"
See
!
"
returned
the
mender
of
roads
,
with
extended
finger
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
go
down
here
,
and
straight
through
the
street
,
and
past
the
fountain
---
"
   
"
To
the
Devil
with
all
that
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
the
other
,
rolling
his
eye
over
the
landscape
.
 
<EOS>
"
\I\
go
through
no
streets
and
past
no
fountains
.
<EOS>
Well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
 
<EOS>
About
two
leagues
beyond
the
summit
of
that
hill
above
the
village
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
.
 
<EOS>
When
do
you
cease
to
work
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
sunset
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
wake
me
,
before
departing
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
walked
two
nights
without
resting
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
finish
my
pipe
,
and
I
shall
sleep
like
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
wake
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Surely
.
"
   
The
wayfarer
smoked
his
pipe
out
,
put
it
in
his
breast
,
slipped
off
his
great
wooden
shoes
,
and
lay
down
on
his
back
on
the
heap
of
stones
.
<EOS>
He
was
fast
asleep
directly
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
road
-
mender
plied
his
dusty
labour
,
and
the
hail
-
clouds
,
rolling
away
,
revealed
bright
bars
and
streaks
of
sky
which
were
responded
to
by
silver
gleams
upon
the
landscape
,
<EOS>
the
little
man
(
who
wore
a
red
cap
now
,
in
place
of
his
blue
one
)
seemed
fascinated
by
the
figure
on
the
heap
of
stones
.
 
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
so
often
turned
towards
it
,
that
he
used
his
tools
mechanically
,
and
,
one
would
have
said
,
to
very
poor
account
.
 
<EOS>
The
bronze
face
,
the
shaggy
black
hair
and
beard
,
the
coarse
woollen
red
cap
,
the
rough
medley
dress
of
home
-
spun
stuff
and
hairy
skins
of
beasts
,
the
powerful
frame
attenuated
by
spare
living
,
and
the
sullen
and
desperate
compression
of
the
lips
in
sleep
,
inspired
the
mender
of
roads
with
awe
.
 
<EOS>
The
traveller
had
travelled
far
,
and
his
feet
were
footsore
,
and
his
ankles
chafed
and
bleeding
;
his
great
shoes
,
stuffed
with
leaves
and
grass
,
had
been
heavy
to
drag
over
the
many
long
leagues
,
and
his
clothes
were
chafed
into
holes
,
as
he
himself
was
into
sores
.
 
<EOS>
Stooping
down
beside
him
,
the
road
-
mender
tried
to
get
a
peep
at
secret
weapons
in
his
breast
or
where
not
;
but
,
in
vain
,
for
he
slept
with
his
arms
crossed
upon
him
,
and
set
as
resolutely
as
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
Fortified
towns
with
their
stockades
,
guard
-
houses
,
gates
,
trenches
,
and
drawbridges
,
seemed
to
the
mender
of
roads
,
to
be
so
much
air
as
against
this
figure
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
he
lifted
his
eyes
from
it
to
the
horizon
and
looked
around
,
he
saw
in
his
small
fancy
similar
figures
,
stopped
by
no
obstacle
,
tending
to
centres
all
over
France
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
slept
on
,
indifferent
to
showers
of
hail
and
intervals
of
brightness
,
to
sunshine
on
his
face
and
shadow
,
to
the
paltering
lumps
of
dull
ice
on
his
body
and
the
diamonds
into
which
the
sun
changed
them
,
until
the
sun
was
low
in
the
west
,
and
the
sky
was
glowing
.
<EOS>
Then
,
the
mender
of
roads
having
got
his
tools
together
and
all
things
ready
to
go
down
into
the
village
,
roused
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
said
the
sleeper
,
rising
on
his
elbow
.
 
<EOS>
"
Two
leagues
beyond
the
summit
of
the
hill
?
"
   
"
About
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
About
.
 
<EOS>
Good
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
mender
of
roads
went
home
,
with
the
dust
going
on
before
him
according
to
the
set
of
the
wind
,
and
was
soon
at
the
fountain
,
squeezing
himself
in
among
the
lean
kine
brought
there
to
drink
,
and
appearing
even
to
whisper
to
them
in
his
whispering
to
all
the
village
.
<EOS>
When
the
village
had
taken
its
poor
supper
,
it
did
not
creep
to
bed
,
as
it
usually
did
,
but
came
out
of
doors
again
,
and
remained
there
.
<EOS>
A
curious
contagion
of
whispering
was
upon
it
,
and
also
,
when
it
gathered
together
at
the
fountain
in
the
dark
,
another
curious
contagion
of
looking
expectantly
at
the
sky
in
one
direction
only
.
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
Gabelle
,
chief
functionary
of
the
place
,
became
uneasy
;
went
out
on
his
house
-
top
alone
,
and
looked
in
that
direction
too
;
glanced
down
from
behind
his
chimneys
at
the
darkening
faces
by
the
fountain
below
,
and
sent
word
to
the
sacristan
who
kept
the
keys
of
the
church
,
that
there
might
be
need
to
ring
the
tocsin
by
-
and
-
bye
.
   
<EOS>
The
night
deepened
.
 
<EOS>
The
trees
environing
the
old
chateau
,
keeping
its
solitary
state
apart
,
moved
in
a
rising
wind
,
as
though
they
threatened
the
pile
of
building
massive
and
dark
in
the
gloom
.
 
<EOS>
Up
the
two
terrace
flights
of
steps
the
rain
ran
wildly
,
and
beat
at
the
great
door
,
like
a
swift
messenger
rousing
those
within
;
uneasy
rushes
of
wind
went
through
the
hall
,
among
the
old
spears
and
knives
,
and
passed
lamenting
up
the
stairs
,
and
shook
the
curtains
of
the
bed
where
the
last
Marquis
had
slept
.
 
<EOS>
East
,
West
,
North
,
and
South
,
through
the
woods
,
four
heavy
-
treading
,
unkempt
figures
crushed
the
high
grass
and
cracked
the
branches
,
striding
on
cautiously
to
come
together
in
the
courtyard
.
 
<EOS>
Four
lights
broke
out
there
,
and
moved
away
in
different
directions
,
and
all
was
black
again
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
not
for
long
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
,
the
chateau
began
to
make
itself
strangely
visible
by
some
light
of
its
own
,
as
though
it
were
growing
luminous
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
a
flickering
streak
played
behind
the
architecture
of
the
front
,
picking
out
transparent
places
,
and
showing
where
balustrades
,
arches
,
and
windows
were
.
 
<EOS>
Then
it
soared
higher
,
and
grew
broader
and
brighter
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
,
from
a
score
of
the
great
windows
,
flames
burst
forth
,
and
the
stone
faces
awakened
,
stared
out
of
fire
.
   
<EOS>
A
faint
murmur
arose
about
the
house
from
the
few
people
who
were
left
there
,
and
there
was
a
saddling
of
a
horse
and
riding
away
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
spurring
and
splashing
through
the
darkness
,
and
bridle
was
drawn
in
the
space
by
the
village
fountain
,
and
the
horse
in
a
foam
stood
at
Monsieur
Gabelle
's
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Help
,
Gabelle
!
 
<EOS>
Help
,
every
one
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
tocsin
rang
impatiently
,
but
other
help
(
if
that
were
any
)
<EOS>
there
was
none
.
 
<EOS>
The
mender
of
roads
,
and
two
hundred
and
fifty
particular
friends
,
stood
with
folded
arms
at
the
fountain
,
looking
at
the
pillar
of
fire
in
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
forty
feet
high
,
"
said
they
,
grimly
;
and
never
moved
.
   
<EOS>
The
rider
from
the
chateau
,
and
the
horse
in
a
foam
,
clattered
away
through
the
village
,
and
galloped
up
the
stony
steep
,
to
the
prison
on
the
crag
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
gate
,
a
group
of
officers
were
looking
at
the
fire
;
removed
from
them
,
a
group
of
soldiers
.
 
<EOS>
"
Help
,
gentlemen
---
officers
!
 
<EOS>
The
chateau
is
on
fire
;
valuable
objects
may
be
saved
from
the
flames
by
timely
aid
!
 
<EOS>
Help
,
help
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
officers
looked
towards
the
soldiers
who
looked
at
the
fire
;
gave
no
orders
;
and
answered
,
with
shrugs
and
biting
of
lips
,
"
It
must
burn
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
rider
rattled
down
the
hill
again
and
through
the
street
,
the
village
was
illuminating
.
 
<EOS>
The
mender
of
roads
,
and
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
particular
friends
,
inspired
as
one
man
and
woman
by
the
idea
of
lighting
up
,
had
darted
into
their
houses
,
and
were
putting
candles
in
every
dull
little
pane
of
glass
.
 
<EOS>
The
general
scarcity
of
everything
,
occasioned
candles
to
be
borrowed
in
a
rather
peremptory
manner
of
Monsieur
Gabelle
;
and
in
a
moment
of
reluctance
and
hesitation
on
that
functionary
's
part
,
the
mender
of
roads
,
once
so
submissive
to
authority
,
had
remarked
that
carriages
were
good
to
make
bonfires
with
,
and
that
post
-
horses
would
roast
.
   
<EOS>
The
chateau
was
left
to
itself
to
flame
and
burn
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
roaring
and
raging
of
the
conflagration
,
a
red
-
hot
wind
,
driving
straight
from
the
infernal
regions
,
seemed
to
be
blowing
the
edifice
away
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
rising
and
falling
of
the
blaze
,
the
stone
faces
showed
as
if
they
were
in
torment
.
 
<EOS>
When
great
masses
of
stone
and
timber
fell
,
the
face
with
the
two
dints
in
the
nose
became
obscured
:
 
<EOS>
anon
struggled
out
of
the
smoke
again
,
as
if
it
were
the
face
of
the
cruel
Marquis
,
burning
at
the
stake
and
contending
with
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
The
chateau
burned
;
the
nearest
trees
,
laid
hold
of
by
the
fire
,
scorched
and
shrivelled
;
trees
at
a
distance
,
fired
by
the
four
fierce
figures
,
begirt
the
blazing
edifice
with
a
new
forest
of
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
Molten
lead
and
iron
boiled
in
the
marble
basin
of
the
fountain
;
the
water
ran
dry
;
the
extinguisher
tops
of
the
towers
vanished
like
ice
before
the
heat
,
and
trickled
down
into
four
rugged
wells
of
flame
.
 
<EOS>
Great
rents
and
splits
branched
out
in
the
solid
walls
,
like
crystallisation
;
stupefied
birds
wheeled
about
and
dropped
into
the
furnace
;
four
fierce
figures
trudged
away
,
East
,
West
,
North
,
and
South
,
along
the
night
-
enshrouded
roads
,
guided
by
the
beacon
they
had
lighted
,
towards
their
next
destination
.
 
<EOS>
The
illuminated
village
had
seized
hold
of
the
tocsin
,
and
,
abolishing
the
lawful
ringer
,
rang
for
joy
.
   
<EOS>
Not
only
that
;
but
the
village
,
light
-
headed
with
famine
,
fire
,
and
bell
-
ringing
,
and
bethinking
itself
that
Monsieur
Gabelle
had
to
do
with
the
collection
of
rent
and
taxes
---
though
it
was
but
a
small
instalment
of
taxes
,
and
no
rent
at
all
,
that
Gabelle
had
got
in
those
latter
days
---
became
impatient
for
an
interview
with
him
,
and
,
surrounding
his
house
,
summoned
him
to
come
forth
for
personal
conference
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
,
Monsieur
Gabelle
did
heavily
bar
his
door
,
and
retire
to
hold
counsel
with
himself
.
 
<EOS>
The
result
of
that
conference
was
,
that
Gabelle
again
withdrew
himself
to
his
housetop
behind
his
stack
of
chimneys
;
this
time
resolved
,
if
his
door
were
broken
in
(
he
was
a
small
Southern
man
of
retaliative
temperament
)
,
to
pitch
himself
head
foremost
over
the
parapet
,
and
crush
a
man
or
two
below
.
   
<EOS>
Probably
,
Monsieur
Gabelle
passed
a
long
night
up
there
,
with
the
distant
chateau
for
fire
and
candle
,
and
the
beating
at
his
door
,
combined
with
the
joy
-
ringing
,
for
music
;
not
to
mention
his
having
an
ill
-
omened
lamp
slung
across
the
road
before
his
posting
-
house
gate
,
which
the
village
showed
a
lively
inclination
to
displace
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
A
trying
suspense
,
to
be
passing
a
whole
summer
night
on
the
brink
of
the
black
ocean
,
ready
to
take
that
plunge
into
it
upon
which
Monsieur
Gabelle
had
resolved
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
friendly
dawn
appearing
at
last
,
and
the
rush
-
candles
of
the
village
guttering
out
,
the
people
happily
dispersed
,
and
Monsieur
Gabelle
came
down
bringing
his
life
with
him
for
that
while
.
   
<EOS>
Within
a
hundred
miles
,
and
in
the
light
of
other
fires
,
there
were
other
functionaries
less
fortunate
,
that
night
and
other
nights
,
whom
the
rising
sun
found
hanging
across
once
-
peaceful
streets
,
where
they
had
been
born
and
bred
;
also
,
there
were
other
villagers
and
townspeople
less
fortunate
than
the
mender
of
roads
and
his
fellows
,
upon
whom
the
functionaries
and
soldiery
turned
with
success
,
and
whom
they
strung
up
in
their
turn
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
fierce
figures
were
steadily

shaken

Three
more
birthdays
of
little
Lucie
had
been
woven
by
the
golden
thread
into
the
peaceful
tissue
of
the
life
of
her
home
.
   
<EOS>
Many
a
night
and
many
a
day
had
its
inmates
listened
to
the
echoes
in
the
corner
,
with
hearts
that
failed
them
when
they
heard
the
thronging
feet
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
the
footsteps
had
become
to
their
minds
as
the
footsteps
of
a
people
,
tumultuous
under
a
red
flag
and
<EOS>
with
their
country
declared
in
danger
,
changed
into
wild
beasts
,
by
terrible
enchantment
long
persisted
in
.
   
<EOS>
Monseigneur
,
as
a
class
,
had
dissociated
himself
from
the
phenomenon
of
his
not
being
appreciated
:
 
of
his
being
so
little
wanted
in
France
,
as
to
incur
considerable
danger
of
receiving
his
dismissal
from
it
,
and
this
life
together
.
 
<EOS>
Like
the
fabled
rustic
who
raised
the
Devil
with
infinite
pains
,
and
was
so
terrified
at
the
sight
of
him
that
he
could
ask
the
Enemy
no
question
,
but
immediately
fled
;
so
,
Monseigneur
,
after
boldly
reading
the
Lord
's
Prayer
backwards
for
a
great
number
of
years
,
and
performing
many
other
potent
spells
for
compelling
the
Evil
One
,
no
sooner
beheld
him
in
his
terrors
than
he
took
to
his
noble
heels

The
shining
Bull
's
Eye
of
the
Court
was
gone
,
or
it
would
have
been
the
mark
for
a
hurricane
of
national
bullets
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
never
been
a
good
eye
to
see
with
---
<EOS>
had
long
had
the
mote
in
it
of
Lucifer
's
pride
,
Sardana
---
palus
's
luxury
,
and
a
mole
's
blindness
---
but
it
had
dropped
out
and
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
The
Court
,
from
that
exclusive
inner
circle
to
its
outermost
rotten
ring
of
intrigue
,
corruption
,
and
dissimulation
,
was
all
gone
together
.
 
<EOS>
Royalty
was
gone
;
had
been
besieged
in
its
Palace
and
"
suspended
,
"
when
the
last
tidings
came
over
.
   
<EOS>
The
August
of
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
ninety
-
two
was
come
,
and
Monseigneur
was
by
this
time
scattered
far
and
wide
.
   
<EOS>
As
was
natural
,
the
head
-
quarters
and
great
gathering
-
place
of
Monseigneur
,
in
London
,
was
Tellson
's
Bank
.
 
<EOS>
Spirits
are
supposed
to
haunt
the
places
where
their
bodies
most
resorted
,
and
Monseigneur
without
a
guinea
haunted
the
spot
where
his
guineas
used
to
be
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
it
was
the
spot
to
which
such
French
intelligence
as
was
most
to
be
relied
upon
,
came
quickest
.
 
<EOS>
Again
:
 
<EOS>
Tellson
's
was
a
munificent
house
,
and
extended
great
liberality
to
old
customers
who
had
fallen
from
their
high
estate
.
 
<EOS>
Again
:
 
those
nobles
who
had
seen
the
coming
storm
in
time
,
and
anticipating
plunder
or
confiscation
,
had
made
provident
remittances
to
Tellson
's
,
were
always
to
be
heard
of
there
by
their
needy
brethren
.
 
<EOS>
To
which
it
must
be
added
that
every
new
-
comer
from
France
reported
himself
and
his
tidings
at
Tellson
's
,
almost
as
a
matter
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
For
such
variety
of
reasons
,
Tellson
's
was
at
that
time
,
as
to
French
intelligence
,
a
kind
of
High
Exchange
;
and
this
was
so
well
known
to
the
public
,
and
the
inquiries
made
there
were
in
consequence
so
numerous
,
that
Tellson
's
sometimes
wrote
the
latest
news
out
in
a
line
or
so
and
posted
it
in
the
Bank
windows
,
for
all
who
ran
through
Temple
Bar
to
read
.
   
<EOS>
On
a
steaming
,
misty
afternoon
,
Mr
Lorry
sat
at
his
desk
,
and
Charles
Darnay
stood
leaning
on
it
,
talking
with
him
in
a
low
voice
.
 
<EOS>
The
penitential
den
once
set
apart
for
interviews
with
the
House
,
was
now
the
news
-
Exchange
,
and
was
filled
to
overflowing
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
within
half
an
hour
or
so
of
the
time
of
closing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
although
you
are
the
youngest

that

"
said
Charles
Darnay
,
rather
hesitating
,
"
I
must
still
suggest
to
you
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
understand
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
am
too
old

said
Mr

.
   
<EOS>
"
Unsettled
weather
,
a
long

a

be
even
safe
for
you

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My

Charles
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
with
cheerful
confidence
,
"
you
touch
some
of
the
reasons
for
my
going
:
 
not
for
my
staying
away
.
<EOS>
It
is
safe
enough
for
me
;
nobody
will
care
to
interfere
with
an
old
fellow
of
hard
upon
fourscore
when
there
are
so
many
people
there
much
better
worth
interfering
with
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
its
being
a
disorganised
city
,
if
it
were
not
a
disorganised
city
there
would
be
no
occasion
to
send
somebody
from
our
House
here
to
our
House
there
,
who
knows
the
city
and
the
business
,
of
old
,
and
is
in
Tellson
's
confidence
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
uncertain
travelling
,
the
long
journey
,
and
the
winter
weather
,
if
I
were
not
prepared
to
submit
myself
to
a
few
inconveniences
for
the
sake
of
Tellson
's
,
after
all
these
years
,
who
ought
to
be
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
were
going
myself
,
"
said
Charles
Darnay
,
somewhat
restlessly
,
<EOS>
and
like
one
thinking
aloud
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
pretty
fellow
to
object
and
advise
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mr
Lorry
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
wish
you
were
going
yourself
?
 
<EOS>
And
you
a
Frenchman
born
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
wise
counsellor
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mr
Lorry
,
it
is
because
I
am
a
Frenchman
born
,
that
the
thought
(
which
I
did
not
mean
to
utter
here
,
however
)
has
passed
through
my
mind
often
.
 
<EOS>
One
can
not
help
thinking
,
having
had
some
sympathy
for
the
miserable
people
,
and
having
abandoned
something
to
them
,
"
he
spoke
here
in
his
former
thoughtful
manner
,
"
that
one
might
be
listened
to
,
and
might
have
the
power
to
persuade
to
some
restraint
.
<EOS>
Only
last
night
,
after
you
had
left
us
,
when
I
was
talking
to
Lucie
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
you
were
talking
to
Lucie
,
"
Mr
Lorry
repeated
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
you
are
not
ashamed
to
mention
the
name
of
Lucie
!
 
<EOS>
Wishing
you
were
going
to
France
at
this
time
of
day
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
However
,
I
am
not
going
,
"
said
Charles
Darnay
,
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
more
to
the
purpose
that
you
say
you
are
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
am
,
in
plain
reality
.
 
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
my
dear
Charles
,
"
Mr
Lorry
glanced
at
the
distant
House
,
and
lowered
his
voice
,
"
you
can
have
no
conception
of
the
difficulty
with
which
our
business
is
transacted
,
and
of
the
peril
in
which
our
books
and
papers
over
yonder
are
involved
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
above
knows
what
the
compromising
consequences
would
be
to
numbers
of
people
,
if
some
of
our
documents
were
seized
or
destroyed
;
and
they
might
be
,
at
any
time
,
you
know
,
for
who
can
say
that
Paris
is
not
set
afire
to

day
,
or
sacked
to

morrow
!
 
<EOS>
Now
,
a
judicious
selection
from
these
with
the
least
possible
delay
,
and
the
burying
of
them
,
or
otherwise
getting
of
them
out
of
harm
's
way
,
is
within
the
power
(
without
loss
of
precious
time
)
of
scarcely
any
one
but
myself
,
if
any
one

<EOS>
And
shall
I
hang
back
,
when
Tellson
's
knows
this
and
says
this
---
Tellson
's
,
whose
bread
I
have
eaten
these
sixty
years
---
because
I
am
a
little
stiff
about
the
joints

<EOS>
Why

I
am
a
boy

sir

to
half
a
dozen
old
codgers

How
I

"
Tut

<EOS>
Nonsense

sir

<EOS>

<EOS>
And
,
my
dear
Charles
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
glancing
at
the
House
again
,
"
you
are
to
remember
,
that
getting
things
out

Paris

this
present

no

is
next

an

Papers

precious
matters
were
this

brought

I
speak

hanging

passed

At
another

our
parcels
would
come

go

as
easily

like
Old

now

everything

And
do
you
really
go

night

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
really
go

become

pressing

admit
of
delay

<EOS>
"
And
do
you
take
no
one
with
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
sorts
of
people
have
been
proposed
to
me
,
but
I
will
have
nothing
to
say
to
any
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
intend
to
take
Jerry

<EOS>
Jerry
has
been
my
bodyguard
on
Sunday
nights
for
a
long
time
past
and
I
am
used
to
him

<EOS>
Nobody
will
suspect
Jerry
of
being
anything
but
an
English
bull
-
dog
,
or
of
having
any
design
in
his
head
but
to
fly
at
anybody
who
touches
his
master

<EOS>
"
I
must
say
again
that
I
heartily
admire
your
gallantry

youthfulness

<EOS>

I
must
say
again
,
nonsense

nonsense

<EOS>
When
I
have
executed
this
little
commission
,
I
shall
,
perhaps
,
accept
Tellson
's
proposal
to
retire
and
live
at
my
ease

<EOS>
Time
enough
,
then

to
think
about
growing
old

"
   
<EOS>
This
dialogue
had
taken
place
at
Mr
Lorry
's
usual
desk
,
with
Monseigneur
swarming
within
a
yard
or
two
of
it
,
boastful
of
what
he
would
do
to
avenge
himself
on
the
rascal
-
people
before
long
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
too
much
the
way
of
Monseigneur
under
his
reverses
as
a
refugee
,
and
it
was
much
too
much
the
way
of
native
British
orthodoxy
,
to
talk
of
this
terrible
Revolution
as
if
it
were
the
only
harvest
ever
known
under
the
skies
that
had
not
been
sown
---
as
if
nothing
had
ever
been
done
,
or
omitted
to
be
done
,
that
had
led
to
it
---
as
if
observers
of
the
wretched
millions
in
France
,
and
of
the
misused
and
perverted
resources
that
should
have
made
them
prosperous
,
had
not
seen
it
inevitably
coming
,
years
before
,
and
had
not
in
plain
words
recorded
what
they
saw
.
 
<EOS>
Such
vapouring
,
combined
with
the
extravagant
plots
of
Monseigneur
for
the
restoration
of
a
state
of
things
that
had
utterly
exhausted
itself
,
and
worn
out
Heaven
and
earth
as
well
as
itself
,
was
hard
to
be
endured
without
some
remonstrance
by
any
sane
man
who
knew
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
was
such
vapouring
all
about
his
ears
,
like
a
troublesome
confusion
of
blood
in
his
own
head
,
added
to
a
latent
uneasiness
in
his
mind
,
which
had
already
made
Charles
Darnay
restless
,
and
which
still
kept
him
so
.
   
<EOS>
Among
the
talkers
,
was
Stryver
,
of
the
King
's
Bench
Bar
,
far
on
his
way
to
state
promotion
,
and
,
therefore
,
loud
on
the
theme
:
 
broaching
to
Monseigneur
,
his
devices
for
blowing
the
people
up
and
exterminating
them
from
the
face
of
the
earth
,
and
doing
without
them
:
and
for
accomplishing
many
similar
objects
akin
in
their
nature
to
the
abolition
of
eagles
by
sprinkling
salt
on
the
tails
of
the
race
.
<EOS>
Him
,
Darnay
heard
with
a
particular
feeling
of
objection
;
and
Darnay
stood
divided
between
going
away
that
he
might
hear
no
more
,
and
remaining
to
interpose
his
word
,
when
the
thing
that
was
to
be
,
went
on
to
shape
itself
out
.
   
<EOS>
The
House
approached
Mr
Lorry
,
and
laying
a
soiled
and
unopened
letter
before
him
,
asked
if
he
had
yet
discovered
any
traces
of
the
person
to
whom
it
was
addressed
?
 
<EOS>
The
House
laid
the
letter
down
so
close
to
Darnay
that
he
saw
the
direction
---
the
more
quickly
because
it
was
his
own
right
name
.
 
<EOS>
The
address
,
turned
into
English
,
ran
:
   
"
<EOS>
Very
pressing

<EOS>
To
Monsieur
heretofore
the
Marquis
St

"
   
<EOS>
On
the
marriage
morning
,
Doctor
Manette
bad
made
it
his
one
urgent
and
express
request
to
Charles
Darnay
,
that
the
secret
of
this
name
should
be
---
unless
he
,
the
Doctor
,
dissolved
the
obligation
---
kept
inviolate
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
else
knew
it
to
be
his
name
;
his
own
wife
had
no
suspicion
of
the
fact
;
Mr
Lorry
could
have
none
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
in
reply
to
the
House
;
<EOS>
"
I
have
referred
it
,
I
think
,
to
everybody
now

tell
me
where

gentleman
is
to
be
found

verging
upon
the
hour
of
closing
the
Bank
<EOS>
,
there
was
a
general
set
of
the
current
of
talkers
past
Mr
Lorry
's
desk
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
the
letter
out
inquiringly
;
and
Monseigneur
looked
at
it
,
in
the
person
of
this
plotting
and
indignant
refugee
;
and
Monseigneur
looked
at
it
in
the
person
of
that
plotting
and
indignant
refugee
;
and
This
,
That
,
and
The
Other
,
all
had
something
disparaging
to
say
,
in
French
or
in
English
,
concerning
the
Marquis
who
was
not
to
be
found
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nephew
,
I
believe
---
but
in
any
case
degenerate
successor
---
of
the
polished
Marquis
who
was
murdered
,
"
said
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
Happy
to
say
,
I
never
knew
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
craven
who
abandoned
his
post
,
"
said
another
---
this
Monseigneur
had
been
got
out
of
Paris
,
legs
uppermost
and
half
suffocated
,
in
a
load
of
hay
---
"
some
years
ago
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Infected
with
the
new
doctrines
,
"
said
a
third
,
eyeing
the
direction
through
his
glass
in
passing
;
"
set
himself
in
opposition
to
the
last
Marquis
,
abandoned
the
estates
when
he
inherited
them
,
and
left
them
to
the
ruffian
herd
.
 
<EOS>
They
will
recompense
him
now
,
I
hope
,
as
he
deserves
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hey
?
"
cried
the
blatant
Stryver
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
he
though
?
 
<EOS>
Is
that
the
sort
of
fellow
?
 
<EOS>
Let
us
look
at
his
infamous
name
.

"
   
<EOS>
Darnay
,
unable
to
restrain
himself
any
longer
,
touched
Mr
Stryver
on
the
shoulder
,
and
said
:
   
"
I
know
the
fellow
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
,
by
Jupiter

"
said
Stryver
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
it

"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mr
Darnay
?
 
<EOS>
D'ye
hear
what
he
did
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
ask
,
why
,
in
these
times
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
ask
why
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
tell
you
again
,
Mr
Darnay
,
I
am
sorry
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
to
hear
you
putting
any
such
extraordinary
questions
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
a
fellow
,
who
,
infected
by
the
most
pestilent
and
blasphemous
code
of
devilry
that
ever
was
known
,
abandoned
his
property
to
the
vilest
scum
of
the
earth
that
ever
did
murder
by
wholesale
,
and
you
ask
me
why
I
am
sorry
that
a
man
who
instructs
youth
knows
him
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
I
'll
answer
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
because
I
believe
there
is
contamination
in
such
a
scoundrel
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
why
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mindful
of
the
secret
,
<EOS>
Darnay
with
great
difficulty
checked
himself
,
and
said
:
 
"
You
may
not
understand
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
understand
how
to
put
YOU
in
a
corner
,
Mr
Darnay
,
"
said
Bully
Stryver
,
"
and
I
'll
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
this
fellow
is
a
gentleman
,
I
DON'T
understand
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
tell
him
so
,
with
my
compliments
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
also
tell
him
,
from
me
,
that
after
abandoning
his
worldly
goods
and
position
to
this
butcherly
mob
,
I
wonder
he
is
not
at
the
head
of
them
.
<EOS>
But
,
no
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Stryver
,
looking
all
round
,
and
snapping
his
fingers
,
"
I
know
something
of
human
nature
,
and
I
tell
you
that
you
'll
never
find
a
fellow
like
this
fellow
,
trusting
himself
to
the
mercies
of
such
precious
PROTEGES

<EOS>
No

gentlemen

;
he
'll
always
show
'em
a
clean
pair
of
heels
very
early
in
the
scuffle

away

"
   
<EOS>
With
those
words
,
and
a
final
snap
of
his
fingers
,
Mr
Stryver
shouldered
himself
into
Fleet
-
street
,
amidst
the
general
approbation
of
his
hearers
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
and
Charles
Darnay
were
left
alone
at
the
desk
,
in
the
general
departure
from
the
Bank
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
take
charge
of
the
letter

"
said
Mr
Lorry
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
where

deliver

<EOS>
"
I
do

<EOS>

Will
you

that

forward

<EOS>
"
I
will
do
so

<EOS>
Do

From

<EOS>
"
I

"
   
<EOS>
Very
ill
at
ease
with
himself
,
and
with
Stryver
and
most
other
men
,
Darnay
made
the
best
of
his
way
into
the
quiet
of
the
Temple

opened
the

read
it

After
having
long
been
in
danger
of
my
life
at
the
hands
of
the
village
,
I
have
been
seized
,
with
great
violence

indignity

brought
a
long
journey
on
foot
to
Paris

On

I
have
suffered
a
great
deal

Nor

that
all

The

I
shall
be
summoned
before

shall
lose
my
life

without

they

treason

I
have
acted

<EOS>
It

in

I
represent
that
I
have
acted
for
them

and
not
against

according

your

<EOS>
It
is
in

<EOS>
I
represent
that
,
before
the
sequestration

emigrant

I
had
remitted
the
imposts
they
had
ceased

that
I

that

The
latent
uneasiness
in
Darnay
's
mind
was
roused
to
vigourous
life
by
this
letter
.
 
<EOS>
The
peril
of
an
old
servant
and
a
good
one
,
whose
only
crime
was
fidelity
to
himself
and
his
family
,
stared
him
so
reproachfully
in
the
face
,
that
,
as
he
walked
to
and
fro
in
the
Temple
considering
what
to
do
,
he
almost
hid
his
face
from
the
passersby
.
   
<EOS>
He
knew
very
well
,
that
in
his
horror
of
the
deed
which
had
culminated
the
bad
deeds
and
bad
reputation
of
the
old
family
house
,
in
his
resentful
suspicions
of
his
uncle
,
and
in
the
aversion
with
which
his
conscience
regarded
the
crumbling
fabric
that
he
was
supposed
to
uphold
,
he
had
acted
imperfectly
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
very
well
,
that
in
his
love
for
Lucie
,
his
renunciation
of
his
social
place
,
though
by
no
means
new
to
his
own
mind
,
had
been
hurried
and
incomplete
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
ought
to
have
systematically
worked
it
out
and
supervised
it
,
and
that
he
had
meant
to
do
it
,
and
that
it
had
never
been
done
.
   
<EOS>
The
happiness
of
his
own
chosen
English
home
,
the
necessity
of
being
always
actively
employed
,
the
swift
changes
and
troubles
of
the
time
which
bad
followed
on
one
another
so
fast
,
that
the
events
of
this
week
annihilated
the
immature
plans
of
last
week
,
and
the
events
of
the
week
following
made
all
new
again
;
he
knew
very
well
,
<EOS>
that
to
the
force
of
these
circumstances
he
had
yielded
:
---
not
without
disquiet
,
but
still
without
continuous
and
accumulating
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
had
watched
the
times
for
a
time
of
action
,
and
that
they
had
shifted
and
struggled
until
the
time
had
gone
by
,
and
the
nobility
were
trooping
from
France
by
every
highway
and
byway
,
and
their
property
was
in
course
of
confiscation
and
destruction
,
and
their
very
names
were
blotting
out
,
was
as
well
known
to
himself
as
it
could
be
to
any
new
authority
in
France
that
might
impeach
him
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
he
had
oppressed
no
man
<EOS>
,
he
had
imprisoned
no
man
;
he
was
so
far
from
having
harshly
exacted
payment
of
his
dues
,
that
he
had
relinquished
them
of
his
own
will
,
thrown
himself
on
a
world
with
no
favour
in
it
,
won
his
own
private
place
there
,
and
earned
his
own
bread
.
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
Gabelle
had
held
the
impoverished
and
involved
estate
on
written
instructions
,
to
spare
the
people
,
to
give
them
what
little
there
was
to
give
---
such
fuel
as
the
heavy
creditors
would
let
them
have
in
the
winter
,
and
such
produce
as
could
be
saved
from
the
same
grip
in
the
summer
---
and
no
doubt
he
had
put
the
fact
in
plea
and
proof
,
for
his
own
safety
,
so
that
it
could
not
but
appear
now
.
   
<EOS>
This
favoured
the
desperate
resolution
Charles
Darnay
had
begun
to
make
,
that
he
would
go
to
Paris
.
   
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Like
the
mariner
in
the
old
story
,
the
winds
and
streams
had
driven
him
within
the
influence
of
the
Loadstone
Rock
,
and
it
was
drawing
him
to
itself
,
and
he
must
go
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
that
arose
before
his
mind
drifted
him
on
,
faster
and
faster
,
more
and
more
steadily
,
to
the
terrible
attraction
.
 
<EOS>
His
latent
uneasiness
had
been
,
that
bad
aims
were
being
worked
out
in
his
own
unhappy
land
by
bad
instruments
,
and
that
he
who
could
not
fail
to
know
that
he
was
better
than
they
,
was
not
there
,
trying
to
do
something
to
stay
bloodshed
,
and
assert
the
claims
of
mercy
and
humanity
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
uneasiness
half
stifled
,
and
half
reproaching
him
,
he
had
been
brought
to
the
pointed
comparison
of
himself
with
the
brave
old
gentleman
in
whom
duty
was
so
strong
;
upon
that
comparison
(
injurious
to
himself
)
had
instantly
followed
the
sneers
of
Monseigneur
,
which
had
stung
him
bitterly
,
and
those
of
Stryver
,
which
above
all
were
coarse
and
galling
,
for
old
reasons
.
<EOS>
Upon
those
,
had
followed
Gabelle
's
letter
:
 
the
appeal
of
an
innocent
prisoner
,
in
danger
of
death
,
to
his
justice
,
honour
,
and
good
name
.
   
<EOS>
His
resolution
was
made
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
go
to
Paris
.
   
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
The
Loadstone
Rock
was
drawing
him
,
and
he
must
sail
on
,
until
he
struck
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
of
no
rock
;
he
saw
hardly
any
danger
.
 
<EOS>
The
intention
with
which
he
had
done
what
he
had
done
,
even
although
he
had
left
it
incomplete
,
presented
it
before
him
in
an
aspect
that
would
be
gratefully
acknowledged
in
France
on
his
presenting
himself
to
assert
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
that
glorious
vision
of
doing
good
,
which
is
so
often
the
sanguine
mirage
of
so
many
good
minds
,
arose
before
him
,
and
he
even
saw
himself
in
the
illusion
with
some
influence
to
guide
this
raging
Revolution
that
was
running
so
fearfully
wild
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
walked
to
and
fro
with
his
resolution
made
,
he
considered
that
neither
Lucie
nor
her
father
must
know
of
it
until
he
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Lucie
should
be
spared
the
pain
of
separation
;
and
her
father
,
always
reluctant
to
turn
his
thoughts
towards
the
dangerous
ground
of
old
,
should
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
step
,
as
a
step
taken
,
and
not
in
the
balance
of
suspense
and
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
How
much
of
the
incompleteness
of
his
situation
was
referable
to
her
father
,
through
the
painful
anxiety
to
avoid
reviving
old
associations
of
France
in
his
mind
,
he
did
not
discuss
with
himself
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
that
circumstance
too
,
had
had
its
influence
in
his
course
.
   
<EOS>
He
walked
to
and
fro
,
with
thoughts
very
busy
,
until
it
was
time
to
return
to
Tellson
's
and
take
leave
of
Mr
Lorry
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
arrived
in
Paris
he
would
present
himself
to
this
old
friend
,
but
he
must
say
nothing
of
his
intention
now
.
   
<EOS>
A
carriage
with
post
-
horses
was
ready
at
the
Bank
door
,
and
Jerry
was
booted
and
equipped
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
delivered
that
letter
,
"
said
Charles
Darnay
to
Mr
Lorry
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
consent
to
your
being
charged
with
any
written
answer
,
but
perhaps
you
will
take
a
verbal
one
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
I
will
,
and
readily

said
Mr
Lorry
,
"
if
it

not

Simply

He
helped
Mr
Lorry
to
wrap
himself
in
a
number
of
coats
and
cloaks
,
and
went
out
with
him
from
the
warm
atmosphere
of
the
old
Bank
,
into
the
misty
air
of
Fleet
-

"
My

said
Mr

at
parting
,
"
and

precious

of

till

"
 
<EOS>
Charles
Darnay
shook
his
head
and
doubtfully
smiled
,
as
the
carriage
rolled
away
.
   
<EOS>
That
night
---
it
was
the
fourteenth
of
August
---
he
sat
up
late
,
and
wrote
two
fervent
letters
;
one
was
to
Lucie
,
explaining
the
strong
obligation
he
was
under
to
go
to
Paris
,
and
showing
her
,
at
length
,
the
reasons
that
he
had
,
for
feeling
confident
that
he
could
become
involved
in
no
personal
danger
there
;
the
other
was
to
the
Doctor
,
confiding
Lucie
and
their
dear
child
to
his
care
,
and
dwelling
on
the
same
topics
with
the
strongest
assurances
.
 
<EOS>
To
both
,
he
wrote
that
he
would
despatch
letters
in
proof
of
his
safety
,
immediately
after
his
arrival
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
hard
day
,
that
day
of
being
among
them
,
with
the
first
reservation
of
their
joint
lives
on
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
hard
matter
to
preserve
the
innocent
deceit
of
which
they
were
profoundly
unsuspicious
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
an
affectionate
glance
at
his
wife
,
<EOS>
so
happy
and
busy
,
made
him
resolute
not
to
tell
her
what
impended
<EOS>
(
he
had
been
half
moved
to
do
it
,
so
strange
it
was
to
him
to
act
in
anything
without
her
quiet
aid
)
,
and
the
day
passed
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
Early
in
the
evening
he
embraced
her
,
and
her
scarcely
less
dear
namesake
,
pretending
that
he
would
return
by
-
and
-
bye
(
an
imaginary
engagement
took
him
out
,
and
he
had
secreted
a
valise
of
clothes
ready
)
,
and
so
he
emerged
into
the
heavy
mist
of
the
heavy
streets
,
with
a
heavier
heart
.
   
<EOS>
The
unseen
force
was
drawing
him
fast
to
itself
,
now
,
and
all
the
tides
and
winds
were
setting
straight
and
strong
towards
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
left
his
two
letters
with
a
trusty
porter
,
to
be
delivered
half
an
hour
before
midnight
,
and
no
sooner
;
took
horse
for
Dover
;
and
began
his
journey
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
the
love
of
Heaven
,
of
justice
,
of
generosity
,
of
the
honour
of
your
noble
name
!
"
was
the
poor
prisoner
's
cry
with
which
he
strengthened
his
sinking
heart
,
as
he
left
all
that
was
dear
on
earth
behind
him
,
and
floated
away
for
the
Loadstone
Rock
.

<EOS>
In
Secret
 
<EOS>
The
traveller
fared
slowly
on
his
way
,
who
fared
towards
Paris
from
England
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
ninety
-
two
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
enough
of
bad
roads
,
bad
equipages
,
and
bad
horses
,
he
would
have
encountered
to
delay
him
,
though
the
fallen
and
unfortunate
King
of
France
had
been
upon
his
throne
in
all
his
glory
;
but
,
the
changed
times
were
fraught
with
other
obstacles
than
these
.
<EOS>
Every
town
-
gate
and
village
taxing
-
house
had
its
band
of
citizen
-
patriots
,
with
their
national
muskets
in
a
most
explosive
state
of
readiness
,
who
stopped
all
comers
and
goers
,
cross
-
questioned
them
,
inspected
their
papers
,
looked
for
their
names
in
lists
of
their
own
,
turned
them
back
,
or
sent
them
on
,
or
stopped
them
and
laid
them
in
hold
,
as
their
capricious
judgment
or
fancy
deemed
best
for
the
dawning
Republic
One
and
Indivisible
,
of
Liberty
,
Equality
,
Fraternity
,
or
Death
.
   
<EOS>
A
very
few
French
leagues
of
his
journey
were
accomplished
,
when
Charles
Darnay
began
to
perceive
that
for
him
along
these
country
roads
there
was
no
hope
of
return
until
he
should
have
been
declared
a
good
citizen
at
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
might
befall
now
,
he
must
on
to
his
journey
's
end
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
mean
village
closed
upon
him
,
not
a
common
barrier
dropped
across
the
road
behind
him
,
but
he
knew
it
to
be
another
iron
door
in
the
series
that
was
barred
between
him
and
England
.
 
<EOS>
The
universal
watchfulness
so
encompassed
him
,
that
if
he
had
been
taken
in
a
net
,
or
were
being
forwarded
to
his
destination
in
a
cage
,
he
could
not
have
felt
his
freedom
more
completely
gone
.
   
<EOS>
This
universal
watchfulness
not
only
stopped
him
on
the
highway
twenty
times
in
a
stage
,
but
retarded
his
progress
twenty
times
in
a
day
,
by
riding
after
him
and
taking
him
back
,
riding
before
him
and
stopping
him
by
anticipation
,
riding
with
him
and
keeping
him
in
charge
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
days
upon
his
journey
in
France
alone
,
when
he
went
to
bed
tired
out
,
in
a
little
town
on
the
high
road
,
still
a
long
way
from
Paris
.
   
<EOS>
Nothing
but
the
production
of
the
afflicted
Gabelle
's
letter
from
his
prison
of
the
Abbaye
would
have
got
him
on
so
far
.
 
<EOS>
Ms
difficulty
at
the
guard
-
house
in
this
small
place
had
been
such
,
that
he
felt
his
journey
to
have
come
to
a
crisis
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
was
,
therefore
,
as
little
surprised
as
a
man
could
be
,
to
find
himself
awakened
at
the
small
inn
to
which
he
had
been
remitted
until
morning
,
in
the
middle
of
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
Awakened
by
a
timid
local
functionary
and
three
armed
patriots
in
rough
red
caps
and
with
pipes
in
their
mouths
,
who
sat
down
on
the
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Emigrant
,
"
said
the
functionary
,
"
I
am
going
to
send
you
on
to
Paris
,
under
an
escort
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Citizen
,
I
desire
nothing
more
than
to
get
to
Paris
,
though
I
could
dispense
with
the
escort
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Silence
!
<EOS>
"
growled
a
red
-
cap
,
striking
at
the
coverlet
with
the
butt
-
end
of
his
musket
.
 
<EOS>
"
Peace
,
aristocrat
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
as
the
good
patriot
says
,
"
observed
the
timid
functionary
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
an
aristocrat
,
and
must
have
an
escort
---
and
must
pay
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
choice
,
"
said
Charles
Darnay
.
   
<EOS>
"
Choice
!
 
<EOS>
Listen
to
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
same
scowling
red
-
cap
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
if
it
was
not
a
favour
to
be
protected
from
the
lamp
-
iron
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
always
as
the
good
patriot
says
,
"
observed
the
functionary
.
<EOS>
"
Rise
and
dress
yourself
,
emigrant
.
"
   
<EOS>
Darnay
complied
,
and
was
taken
back
to
the
guard
-
house
,
where
other
patriots
in
rough
red
caps
were
smoking
,
drinking
,
and
sleeping
,
by
a
watch
-
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Here
he
paid
a
heavy
price
for
his
escort
,
and
hence
he
started
with
it
on
the
wet
,
wet
roads
at
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
   
<EOS>
The
escort
were
two
mounted
patriots
in
red
caps
and
tri
-
coloured
cockades
,
armed
with
national
muskets
and
sabres
,
who
rode
one
on
either
side
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
escorted
governed
his
own
horse
,
but
a
loose
line
was
attached
to
his
bridle
,
the
end
of
which
one
of
the
patriots
kept
girded
round
his
wrist
.
<EOS>
In
this
state
they
set
forth
with
the
sharp
rain
driving
in
their
faces
:
 
clattering
at
a
heavy
dragoon
trot
over
the
uneven
town
pavement
,
and
out
upon
the
mire
-
deep
roads
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
state
they
traversed
without
change
,
except
of
horses
and
pace
,
all
the
mire
-
deep
leagues
that
lay
between
them
and
the
capital
.
   
<EOS>
They
travelled
in
the
night
,
halting
an
hour
or
two
after
daybreak
,
and
lying
by
until
the
twilight
fell
.
 
<EOS>
The
escort
were
so
wretchedly
clothed
,
that
they
twisted
straw
<EOS>
round
their
bare
legs
,
and
thatched
their
ragged
shoulders
to
keep
the
wet
off
.
 
<EOS>
Apart
from
the
personal
discomfort
of
being
so
attended
,
and
apart
from
such
considerations
of
present
danger
as
arose
from
one
of
the
patriots
being
chronically
drunk
,
and
carrying
his
musket
very
recklessly
,
Charles
Darnay
did
not
allow
the
restraint
that
was
laid
upon
him
to
awaken
any
serious
fears
in
his
breast
;
for
,
he
reasoned
with
himself
that
it
could
have
no
reference
to
the
merits
of
an
individual
case
that
was
not
yet
stated
,
and
of
representations
,
confirmable
by
the
prisoner
in
the
Abbaye
,
that
were
not
yet
made
.
   
<EOS>
But
when
they
came
to
the
town
of
Beauvais
---
which
they
did
at
eventide
,
when
the
streets
were
filled
with
people
---
he
could
not
conceal
from
himself
that
the
aspect
of
affairs
was
very
alarming
.
<EOS>
An
ominous
crowd
gathered
to
see
him
dismount
of
the
posting
-
yard
,
and
many
voices
called
out
loudly
,
"
Down
with
the
emigrant
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
stopped
in
the
act
of
swinging
himself
out
of
his
saddle
,
and
,
resuming
it
as
his
safest
place
,
said
:
   
"
Emigrant
,
my
friends
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
not
see
me
here
,
in
France
,
of
my
own
will
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
cursed
emigrant
,
"
cried
a
farrier
,
making
at
him
in
a
furious
manner
through
the
press
,
hammer
in
hand
;
"
and
you
are
a
cursed
aristocrat
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
postmaster
interposed
himself
between
this
man
and
the
rider
's
bridle
(
at
which
he
was
evidently
making
)
,
and
soothingly
said
,
"
Let
him
be
;
let
him
be
!
 
<EOS>
He
will
be
judged
at
Paris
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Judged
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
the
farrier
,
swinging
his
hammer
.
"
<EOS>
Ay
!
<EOS>
and
condemned
as
a
traitor
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
the
crowd
roared
approval
.
   
<EOS>
Checking
the
postmaster
,
who
was
for
turning
his
horse
's
head
to
the
yard
(
the
drunken
patriot
sat
composedly
in
his
saddle
looking
on
,
with
the
line
round
his
wrist
)
,
Darnay
said
,
as
soon
as
he
could
make
his
voice
heard
:
   
<EOS>
"
Friends
,
you
deceive
yourselves
,
or
you
are
deceived
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
traitor
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
lies
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
smith
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
a
traitor
since
the
decree
.
<EOS>
His
life
is
forfeit
to
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
His
cursed
life
is
not
his
own
!
"
   
<EOS>
At
the
instant
when
Darnay
saw
a
rush
in
the
eyes
of
the
crowd
,
which
another
instant
would
have
brought
upon
him
,
the
postmaster
turned
his
horse
into
the
yard
,
the
escort
rode
in
close
upon
his
horse
's
flanks
,
and
the
postmaster
shut
and
barred
the
crazy
double
gates
.
 
<EOS>
The
farrier
struck
a
blow
upon
them
with
his
hammer
,
and
the
crowd
groaned
;
but
,
no
more
was
done
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
decree
that
the
smith
spoke
of
?
"
<EOS>
Darnay
asked
the
postmaster
,
when
he
had
thanked
him
,
and
stood
beside
him
in
the
yard
.
   
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
a
decree
for
selling
the
property
of
emigrants
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
passed
?
"
   
"
On
the
fourteenth
.
"
   
"
The
day
I
left
England
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Everybody
says
it
is
but
one
of
several
,
and
that
there
will
be
others
---
if
there
are
not
already
-
banishing
all
emigrants
,
and
condemning
all
to
death
who
return
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
what
he
meant
when
he
said
your
life
was
not
your
own
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
there
are
no
such
decrees
yet
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
I
know
!
"
said
the
postmaster
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
;
"
there
may
be
,
or
there
will
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
all
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
What
would
you
have
?
"
   
<EOS>
They
rested
on
some
straw
in
a
loft
until
the
middle
of
the
night
,
and
then
rode
forward
again
when
all
the
town
was
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
many
wild
changes
observable
on
familiar
things
which
made
this
wild
ride
unreal
,
not
the
least
was
the
seeming
rarity
of
sleep
.
<EOS>
After
long
and
lonely
spurring
over
dreary
roads
,
they
would
come
to
a
cluster
of
poor
cottages
,
not
steeped
in
darkness
,
but
all
glittering
with
lights
,
and
would
find
the
people
,
in
a
ghostly
manner
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
circling
hand
in
hand
round
a
shrivelled
tree
of
Liberty
,
or
all
drawn
up
together
singing
a
Liberty
song
.
 
<EOS>
Happily
,
however
,
there
was
sleep
in
Beauvais
that
night
to
help
them
out
of
it
<EOS>
and
they
passed
on
once
more
into
solitude
and
loneliness
:
 
<EOS>
jingling
through
the
untimely
cold
and
wet
,
among
impoverished
fields
that
had
yielded
no
fruits
of
the
earth
that
year
,
diversified
by
the
blackened
remains
of
burnt
houses
,
and
by
the
sudden
emergence
from
ambuscade
,
and
sharp
reining
up
across
their
way
,
of
patriot
patrols
on
the
watch
on
all
the
roads
.
   
<EOS>
Daylight
at
last
found
them
before
the
wall
of
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
The
barrier
was
closed
and
strongly
guarded
when
they
rode
up
to
it
.

?
"
demanded
a
resolute
-
looking
man
in
authority
,
who
was
summoned
out
by
the
guard
.
   
<EOS>
Naturally
struck
by
the
disagreeable
word
,
Charles
Darnay
requested
the
speaker
to
take
notice
that
he
was
a
free
traveller
and
French
citizen
,
in
charge
of
an
escort
which
the
disturbed
state
of
the
country
had
imposed
upon
him
,
and
which
he
had
paid
for
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
,
"
repeated
the
same
personage
,
without
taking
any
heed
of
him
whatever
,
"
are
the
papers
of
this
prisoner
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
drunken
patriot
had
them
in
his
cap
,
and
produced
them
.
 
<EOS>
Casting
his
eyes
over
Gabelle
's
letter
,
the
same
personage
in
authority
showed
some
disorder
and
surprise
,
and
looked
at
Darnay
with
a
close
attention
.
   
<EOS>
He
left
escort
and
escorted
without
saying
a
word
,
however
,
and
went
into
the
guard
-
room
;
meanwhile
,
they
sat
upon
their
horses
outside
the
gate
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
about
him
while
in
this
state
of
suspense
,
Charles
Darnay
observed
that
the
gate
was
held
by
a
mixed
guard
of
soldiers
and
patriots
,
the
latter
far
outnumbering
the
former
;
and
that
while
ingress
into
the
city
for
peasants
'
carts
bringing
in
supplies
,
and
for
similar
traffic
and
traffickers
,
was
easy
enough
,
egress
,
even
for
the
homeliest
people
,
was
very
difficult
.
 
<EOS>
A
numerous
medley
of
men
and
women
,
not
to
mention
beasts
and
vehicles
of
various
sorts
,
was
waiting
to
issue
forth
;
but
,
the
previous
identification
was
so
strict
,
that
they
filtered
through
the
barrier
very
slowly
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
these
people
knew
their
turn
for
examination
to
be
so
far
off
,
that
they
lay
down
on
the
ground
to
sleep
or
smoke
,
while
others
talked
together
,
or
loitered
about
.
 
<EOS>
The
red
cap
and
tri
-
colour
cockade
were
universal
,
both
among
men
and
women
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
had
sat
in
his
saddle
some
half
-
hour
,
taking
note
of
these
things
,
Darnay
found
himself
confronted
by
the
same
man
in
authority
,
who
directed
the
guard
to
open
the
barrier
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
delivered
to
the
escort
,
drunk
and
sober
,
a
receipt
for
the
escorted
,
and
requested
him
to
dismount
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
so
,
and
the
two
patriots
,
leading
his
tired
horse
,
turned
and
rode
away
without
entering
the
city
.
   
<EOS>
He
accompanied
his
conductor
into
a
guard
-
room
,
smelling
of
common
wine
and
tobacco
,
where
certain
soldiers
and
patriots
,
asleep
and
awake
,
drunk
and
sober
,
and
in
various
neutral
states
between
sleeping
and
waking
,
drunkenness
and
sobriety
,
were
standing
and
lying
about
.
<EOS>
The
light
in
the
guard
-
house
,
half
derived
from
the
waning
oil
-
lamps
of
the
night
,
and
half
from
the
overcast
day
,
was
in
a
correspondingly
uncertain
condition
.
 
<EOS>
Some
registers
were
lying
open
on
a
desk
,
and
an
officer
of
a
coarse
,
dark
aspect
,
presided
over
these
.
   
<EOS>
"
Citizen
Defarge
,
"
said
he
to
Darnay
's
conductor
,
as
he
took
a
slip
of
paper
to
write
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
this
the
emigrant
Evremonde
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
age
,
Evremonde
?
"
   
"
Thirty
-
seven
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Married
,
Evremonde
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
married
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
England
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Without
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
Where
is
your
wife
,
Evremonde
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
England
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Without
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
consigned
,
Evremonde
,
to
the
prison
of
La
Force
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Just
Heaven
!
"
exclaimed
Darnay
.
 
<EOS>
"
Under
what
law
,
and
for
what
offence
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
officer
looked
up
from
his
slip
of
paper
for
a
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
new
laws
,
Evremonde
,
and
new
offences
,
since
you
were
here
.
"
<EOS>
He
said
it
with
a
hard
smile
,
and
went
on
writing
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
entreat
you
to
observe
that
I
have
come
here
voluntarily
,
in
response
to
that
written
appeal
of
a
fellow
-
countryman
which
lies
before
you
.
<EOS>
I
demand
no
more
than
the
opportunity
to
do
so
without
delay
.
<EOS>
Is
not
that
my
right
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Emigrants
have
no
rights
,
Evremonde
,
"
was
the
stolid
reply
.
<EOS>
The
officer
wrote
until
he
had
finished
,
read
over
to
himself
what
he
had
written
,
sanded
it
,
and
handed
it
to
Defarge
,
with
the
words
"
In
secret
.
"
   
<EOS>
Defarge
motioned
with
the
paper
to
the
prisoner
that
he
must
accompany
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
prisoner
obeyed
,
and
a
guard
of
two
armed
patriots
attended
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
you
,
"
said
Defarge
,
in
a
low
voice
,
as
they
went
down
the
guardhouse
steps
and
turned
into
Paris
,
"
<EOS>
who
married
the
daughter
of
Doctor
Manette
,
once
a
prisoner
in
the
Bastille
that
is
no
more
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Darnay
,
looking
at
him
with
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Defarge
,
and
I
keep
a
wine
-
shop
in
the
Quarter
Saint
Antoine
.
 
<EOS>
Possibly
you
have
heard
of
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
wife
came
to
your
house
to
reclaim
her
father
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
word
"
wife
"
seemed
to
serve
as
a
gloomy
reminder
to
Defarge
,
to
say
with
sudden
impatience
,
"
<EOS>
In
the
name
of
that
sharp
female
newly
-
born
,
and
called
La
Guillotine
,
why
did
you
come
to
France
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
heard
me
say
why
,
a
minute
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
not
believe
it
is
the
truth
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
A
bad
truth
for
you
,
"
said
Defarge
,
speaking
with
knitted
brows
,
and
looking
straight
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
am
lost
here
.
 
<EOS>
All
here
is
so
unprecedented
,
so
changed
,
so
sudden
and
unfair
,
that
I
am
absolutely
lost
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
render
me
a
little
help
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
None
.
"
 
<EOS>
Defarge
spoke
,
always
looking
straight
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
answer
me
a
single
question
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
According
to
its
nature
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
say
what
it
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
this
prison
that
I
am
going
to
so
unjustly
,
shall
I
have
some
free
communication
with
the
world
outside
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
to
be
buried
there
,
prejudged
,
and
without
any
means
of
presenting
my
case
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
Other
people
have
been
similarly
buried
in
worse
prisons
,
before
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
never
by
me
,
Citizen
Defarge
.
"
   
<EOS>
Defarge
glanced
darkly
at
him
for
answer
,
and
walked
on
in
a
steady
and
set
silence
.
 
<EOS>
The
deeper
he
sank
into
this
silence
,
<EOS>
the
fainter
hope
there
was
---
or
so
Darnay
thought
---
of
his
softening
in
any
slight
degree
.
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
made
haste
to
say
:
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
me
(
you
know
,
Citizen
,
even
better
than
I
,
of
how
much
importance
)
,
that
I
should
be
able
to
communicate
to
Mr
Lorry
of
Tellson
's
Bank
,
an
English
gentleman
who
is
now
in
Paris
,
the
simple
fact
,
without
comment
,
that
I
have
been
thrown
into
the
prison
of
La
Force
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
cause
that
to
be
done
for
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
,
"
Defarge
doggedly
rejoined
,
"
nothing
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
My
duty
is
to
my
country
and
the
People
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
the
sworn
servant
of
both
,
against
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
do
nothing
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Charles
Darnay
felt
it
hopeless
to
entreat
him
further
,
and
his
pride
was
touched
besides
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
walked
on
in
silence
,
he
could
not
but
see
how
used
the
people
were
to
the
spectacle
of
prisoners
passing
along
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
children
scarcely
noticed
him
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
passers
turned
their
heads
,
and
a
few
shook
their
fingers
at
him
as
an
aristocrat
;
otherwise
,
that
a
man
in
good
clothes
should
be
going
to
prison
,
was
no
more
remarkable
than
that
a
labourer
in
working
clothes
should
be
going
to
work
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
narrow
,
dark
,
and
dirty
street
through
which
they
passed
,
an
excited
orator
,
mounted
on
a
stool
,
was
addressing
an
excited
audience
on
the
cranes
against
the
people
,
of
the
king
and
the
royal
family
.
 
<EOS>
The
few
words
that
he
caught
from
this
man
's
lips
,
first
made
it
known
to
Charles
Darnay
that
the
king
was
in
prison
,
and
that
the
foreign
ambassadors
had
one
and
all
left
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
road
(
except
at
Beauvais
)
<EOS>
he
had
heard
absolutely
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
escort
and
the
universal
watchfulness
had
completely
isolated
him
.
   
<EOS>
That
he
had
fallen
among
far
greater
dangers
than
those
which
had
developed
themselves
when
he
left
England
,
he
of
course
knew
now
.
<EOS>
That
perils
had
thickened
about
him
fast
,
and
might
thicken
faster
and
faster
yet
,
he
of
course
knew
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
admit
to
himself
that
he
might
not
have
made
this
journey
,
if
he
could
have
foreseen
the
events
of
a
few
days
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
his
misgivings
were
not
so
dark
as
,
imagined
by
the
light
of
this
later
time
,
they
would
appear
.
<EOS>
Troubled
as
the
future
was
,
it
was
the
unknown
future
,
and
in
its
obscurity
there
was
ignorant
hope
.
 
<EOS>
The
horrible
massacre
,
days
and
nights
long
,
which
,
within
a
few
rounds
of
the
clock
,
was
to
set
a
great
mark
of
blood
upon
the
blessed
garnering
time
of
harvest
,
was
as
far
out
of
his
knowledge
as
if
it
had
been
a
hundred
thousand
years
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
"
sharp
female
newly
-
born
,
and
called
La
Guillotine
,
"
was
hardly
known
to
him
,
or
to
the
generality
of
people
,
by
name
.
<EOS>
The
frightful
deeds
that
were
to
be
soon
done
,
were
probably
unimagined
at
that
time
in
the
brains
of
the
doers
.
 
<EOS>
How
could
they
have
a
place
in
the
shadowy
conceptions
of
a
gentle
mind
?
   
<EOS>
Of
unjust
treatment
in
detention
and
hardship
,
and
in
cruel
separation
from
his
wife
and
child
,
he
foreshadowed
the
likelihood
,
or
the
certainty
;
but
,
beyond
this
,
he
dreaded
nothing
distinctly
.
<EOS>
With
this
on
his
mind
,
which
was
enough
to
carry
into
a
dreary
prison
courtyard
,
he
arrived
at
the
prison
of
La
Force
.
   
<EOS>
A
man
with
a
bloated
face
opened
the
strong
wicket
,
to
whom
Defarge
presented
"
The
Emigrant
Evremonde
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
the
Devil
!
 
<EOS>
How
many
more
of
them
!
"
exclaimed
the
man
with
the
bloated
face
.
   
<EOS>
Defarge
took
his
receipt
without
noticing
the
exclamation
,
and
withdrew
,
with
his
two
fellow
-
patriots
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
the
Devil
,
I
say
again
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
gaoler
,
left
with
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
How
many
more
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
gaoler
's
wife
,
being
provided
with
no
answer
to
the
question
,
merely
replied
,
"
One
must
have
patience
,
my
dear
!
"
 
<EOS>
Three
turnkeys
who
entered
responsive
to
a
bell
she
rang
,
echoed
the
sentiment
,
and
one
added
,
"
For
the
love
of
Liberty
;
"
which
sounded
in
that
place
like
an
inappropriate
conclusion
.
   
<EOS>
The
prison
of
La
Force
was
a
gloomy
prison
,
dark
and
filthy
,
and
with
a
horrible
smell
of
foul
sleep
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Extraordinary
how
soon
the
noisome
flavour
of
imprisoned
sleep
,
becomes
manifest
in
all
such
places
that
are
ill
cared
for
!
   
<EOS>
"
In
secret
,
too
,
"
grumbled
the
gaoler
,
looking
at
the
written
paper
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
if
I
was
not
already
full
to
bursting
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
stuck
the
paper
on
a
file
,
in
an
ill
-
humour
,
and
Charles
Darnay
awaited
his
further
pleasure
for
half
an
hour
:
 
sometimes
,
pacing
to
and
fro
in
the
strong
arched
room
:
 
sometimes
,
resting
on
a
stone
seat
:
in
either
case
detained
to
be
imprinted
on
the
memory
of
the
chief
and
his
subordinates
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
chief
,
at
length
taking
up
his
keys
,
"
come
with
me
,
emigrant
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Through
the
dismal
prison
twilight
,
his
new
charge
accompanied
him
by
corridor
and
staircase
,
many
doors
clanging
and
locking
behind
them
,
until
they
came
into
a
large
,
low
,
vaulted
chamber
,
crowded
with
prisoners
of
both
sexes
.
 
<EOS>
The
women
were
seated
at
a
long
table
,
reading
and
writing
,
knitting
,
sewing
,
and
embroidering
;
the
men
were
for
the
most
part
standing
behind
their
chairs
,
or
lingering
up
and
down
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
instinctive
association
of
prisoners
with
shameful
crime
and
disgrace
,
the
new
-
comer
recoiled
from
this
company
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
crowning
unreality
of
his
long
unreal
ride
,
was
,
their
all
at
once
rising
to
receive
him
,
with
every
refinement
of
manner
known
to
the
time
,
and
with
all
the
engaging
graces
and
courtesies
of
life
.
   
<EOS>
So
strangely
clouded
were
these
refinements
by
the
prison
manners
and
gloom
<EOS>
,
so
spectral
did
they
become
in
the
inappropriate
squalor
and
misery
through
which
they
were
seen
,
that
Charles
Darnay
seemed
to
stand
in
a
company
of
the
dead
.
 
<EOS>
Ghosts
all
!
 
<EOS>
The
ghost
of
beauty
,
the
ghost
of
stateliness
,
the
ghost
of
elegance
,
the
ghost
of
pride
,
the
ghost
of
frivolity
,
the
ghost
of
wit
,
the
ghost
of
youth
,
the
ghost
of
age
,
all
waiting
their
dismissal
from
the
desolate
shore
,
all
turning
on
him
eyes
that
were
changed
by
the
death
they
had
died
in
coming
there
.
   
<EOS>
It
struck
him
motionless
.
 
<EOS>
The
gaoler
standing
at
his
side
,
and
the
other
gaolers
moving
about
,
who
would
have
been
well
enough
as
to
appearance
in
the
ordinary
exercise
of
their
functions
,
looked
so
extravagantly
coarse
contrasted
with
sorrowing
mothers
and
blooming
daughters
who
were
there
---
with
the
apparitions
of
the
coquette
,
the
young
beauty
,
and
the
mature
woman
delicately
bred
---
that
the
inversion
of
all
experience
and
likelihood
which
the
scene
of
shadows
presented
,
was
heightened
to
its
utmost
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
,
ghosts
all
.
<EOS>
Surely
,
the
long
unreal
ride
some
progress
of
disease
that
had
brought
him
to
these
gloomy
shades
!
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
name
of
the
assembled
companions
in
misfortune
,
"
said
a
gentleman
of
courtly
appearance
and
address
,
coming
forward
,
"
I
have
the
honour
of
giving
you
welcome
to
La
Force
,
and
of
condoling
with
you
on
the
calamity
that
has
brought
you
among
us
.
<EOS>
May
it
soon
terminate
happily
!
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
an
impertinence
elsewhere
,
but
it
is
not
so
here
,
to
ask
your
name
and
condition
?
"
   
<EOS>
Charles
Darnay
roused
himself
,
and
gave
the
required
information
,
in
words
as
suitable
as
he
could
find
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
hope
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
following
the
chief
gaoler
with
his
eyes
,
who
moved
across
the
room
,
"
that
you
are
not
in
secret
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
the
meaning
of
the
term
,
but
I
have
heard
them
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
what
a
pity
!
 
<EOS>
We
so
much
regret
it
!
 
<EOS>
But
take
courage
;
several
members
of
our
society
have
been
in
secret
,
at
first
,
and
it
has
lasted
but
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Then
he
added
,
raising
his
voice
,
"
I
grieve
to
inform
the
society
---
in
secret
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
murmur
of
commiseration
as
Charles
Darnay
crossed
the
room
to
a
grated
door
where
the
gaoler
awaited
him
,
and
many
voices
---
among
which
,
the
soft
and
compassionate
voices
of
women
were
conspicuous
---
gave
him
good
wishes
and
encouragement
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
at
the
grated
door
,
to
render
the
thanks
of
his
heart
;
it
closed
under
the
gaoler
's
hand
;
and
the
apparitions
vanished
from
his
sight
forever
.
   
<EOS>
The
wicket
opened
on
a
stone
staircase
,
leading
upward
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
bad
ascended
forty
steps
(
the
prisoner
of
half
an
hour
already
counted
them
)
,
the
gaoler
opened
a
low
black
door
,
and
they
passed
into
a
solitary
cell
.
 
<EOS>
It
struck
cold
and
damp
,
but
was
not
dark
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yours
,
"
said
the
gaoler
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
am
I
confined
alone
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
I
know
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
buy
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Such
are
not
my
orders
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
visited
,
and
can
ask
then
.
<EOS>
At
present
,
you
may
buy
your
food
,
and
nothing
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
were
in
the
cell
,
a
chair
,
a
table
,
and
a
straw
mattress
.
<EOS>
As
the
gaoler
made
a
general
inspection
of
these
objects
,
and
of
the
four
walls
,
before
going
out
,
a
wandering
fancy
wandered
through
the
mind
of
the
prisoner
leaning
against
the
wall
opposite
to
him
,
that
this
gaoler
was
so
unwholesomely
bloated
,
both
in
face
and
person
,
as
to
look
like
a
man
who
had
been
drowned
and
filled
with
water
.
<EOS>
When
the
gaoler
was
gone
,
he
thought
in
the
same
wandering
way
,
"
Now
am
I
left
,
as
if
I
were
dead
.
"
 
<EOS>
Stopping
then
,
to
look
down
at
the
mattress
,
he
turned
from
it
with
a
sick
feeling
,
and
thought
,
"
<EOS>
And
here
in
these
crawling
creatures
is
the
first
condition
of
the
body
after
death
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Five
paces
by
four
and
a
half
,
five
paces
by
four
and
a
half
,
five
paces
by
four
and
a
half
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
prisoner
walked
to
and
fro
in
his
cell
,
counting
its
measurement
,
and
the
roar
of
the
city
arose
like
muffled
drums
with
a
wild
swell
of
voices
added
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
made
shoes
,
he
made
shoes
,
he
made
shoes
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
prisoner
counted
the
measurement
again
,
and
paced
faster
,
to
draw
his
mind
with
him
from
that
latter
repetition
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
ghosts
that
vanished
when
the
wicket
closed
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
one
among
them
,
the
appearance
of
a
lady
dressed
in
black
,
who
was
leaning
in
the
embrasure
of
a
window
,
and
she
had
a
light
shining
upon
her
golden
hair
,
and
she
looked
like
---
<EOS>
Let
us
ride
on
again
,
for
God
's
sake
,
through
the
illuminated
villages
with
the
people
all
awake
!
---
<EOS>
He
made
shoes
,
he
made
shoes
,
he
made
shoes
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Five
paces
by
four
and
a
half
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
such
scraps
tossing
and
rolling
upward
from
the
depths
of
his
mind
,
the
prisoner
walked
faster
and
faster
,
obstinately
counting
and
counting
;
and
the
roar
of
the
city
changed
to
this
extent
---
that
it
still
rolled
in
like
muffled
drums
,
but
with
the
wail
of
voices
that
he
knew
,
in
the
swell
that
rose
above
them
.

Chapter
2
.
<EOS>
The
Grindstone
 
Tellson
's
Bank
,
established
in
the
Saint
Germain
Quarter
of
Paris
,
was
in
a
wing
of
a
large
house
,
approached
by
a
courtyard
and
shut
off
from
the
street
by
a
high
wall
and
a
strong
gate
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
belonged
to
a
great
nobleman
who
had
lived
in
it
until
he
made
a
flight
from
the
troubles
,
in
his
own
cook
's
dress
,
and
got
across
the
borders
.
 
<EOS>
A
mere
beast
of
the
chase
flying
from
hunters
<EOS>
,
he
was
still
in
his
metempsychosis
no
other
than
the
same
Monseigneur
,
the
preparation
of
whose
chocolate
for
whose
lips
had
once
occupied
three
strong
men
besides
the
cook
in
question
.
   
<EOS>
Monseigneur
gone
,
and
the
three
strong
men
absolving
themselves
from
the
sin
of
having
drawn
his
high
wages
,
by
being
more
than
ready
and
willing
to
cut
his
throat
on
the
altar
of
the
dawning
Republic
one
and
indivisible
of
Liberty
,
Equality
,
Fraternity
,
or
Death
,
Monseigneur
's
house
had
been
first
sequestrated
,
and
then
confiscated
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
all
things
moved
so
fast
,
and
decree
followed
decree
with
that
fierce
precipitation
,
that
now
upon
the
third
night
of
the
autumn
month
of
September
,
patriot
emissaries
of
the
law
were
in
possession
of
Monseigneur
's
house
,
and
had
marked
it
with
the
tri
-
colour
,
and
were
drinking
brandy
in
its
state
apartments
.
   
<EOS>
A
place
of
business
in
London
like
Tellson
's
place
of
business
in
Paris
,
would
soon
have
driven
the
House
out
of
its
mind
and
into
the
Gazette
.
<EOS>
For
,
what
would
staid
British
responsibility
and
respectability
have
said
to
orange
-
trees
in
boxes
in
a
Bank
courtyard
,
and
even
to
a
Cupid
over
the
counter
?
 
<EOS>
Yet
such
things
were
.
<EOS>
Tellson
's
had
whitewashed
the
Cupid
,
but
he
was
still
to
be
seen
on
the
ceiling
,
in
the
coolest
linen
,
aiming
(
as
he
very
often
does
)
at
money
from
morning
to
night
.
 
<EOS>
Bankruptcy
must
inevitably
have
come
of
this
young
Pagan
,
in
Lombard
-
street
,
London
,
and
also
of
a
curtained
alcove
in
the
rear
of
the
immortal
boy
,
and
also
of
a
looking
-
glass
let
into
the
wall
,
and
also
of
clerks
not
at
all
old
,
who
danced
in
public
on
the
slightest
provocation
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
a
French
Tellson
's
could
get
on
with
these
things
exceedingly
well
,
and
,
as
long
as
the
times
held
together
,
no
man
had
taken
fright
at
them
,
and
drawn
out
his
money
.
   
<EOS>
What
money
would
be
drawn
out
of
Tellson
's
henceforth
,
and
what
would
lie
there
,
lost
and
forgotten
;
what
plate
and
jewels
would
tarnish
in
Tellson
's
hiding
-
places
,
while
the
depositors
rusted
in
prisons
,
and
when
they
should
have
violently
perished
;
how
many
accounts
with
Tellson
's
never
to
be
balanced
in
this
world
,
must
be
carried
over
into
the
next
;
no
man
could
have
said
,
that
night
,
any
more
than
Mr
Jarvis
Lorry
<EOS>
could
,
though
he
thought
heavily
of
these
questions
.
<EOS>
He
sat
by
a
newly
-
lighted
wood
fire
(
the
blighted
and
unfruitful
year
was
prematurely
cold
)
,
and
on
his
honest
and
courageous
face
there
was
a
deeper
shade
than
the
pendent
lamp
could
throw
,
or
any
object
in
the
room
distortedly
reflect
---
a
shade
of
horror
.
   
<EOS>
He
occupied
rooms
in
the
Bank
,
in
his
fidelity
to
the
House
of
which
he
had
grown
to
be
a
part
,
lie
strong
root
-
ivy
.
<EOS>
it
chanced
that
they
derived
a
kind
of
security
from
the
patriotic
occupation
of
the
main
building
,
but
the
true
-
hearted
old
gentleman
never
calculated
about
that
.
 
<EOS>
All
such
circumstances
were
indifferent
to
him
,
so
that
he
did
his
duty
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
courtyard
,
under
a
colonnade
,
was
extensive
standin
---
for
carriages
---
where
,
indeed
,
some
carriages
of
Monseigneur
yet
stood
.
 
<EOS>
Against
two
of
the
pillars
were
fastened
two
great
flaring
flambeaux
,
and
in
the
light
of
these
,
standing
out
in
the
open
air
,
was
a
large
grindstone
:
 
a
roughly
mounted
thing
which
appeared
to
have
hurriedly
been
brought
there
from
some
neighbouring
smithy
,
or
other
workshop
.
 
<EOS>
Rising
and
looking
out
of
window
at
these
harmless
objects
,
Mr
Lorry
shivered
,
and
retired
to
his
seat
by
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
opened
,
not
only
the
glass
window
,
but
the
lattice
blind
outside
it
,
and
he
had
closed
both
again
,
and
he
shivered
through
his
frame
.
   
<EOS>
From
the
streets
beyond
the
high
wall
and
the
strong
gate
,
there
came
the
usual
night
hum
of
the
city
,
with
now
and
then
an
indescribable
ring
in
it
,
weird
and
unearthly
,
as
if
some
unwonted
sounds
of
a
terrible
nature
were
going
up
to
Heaven
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
God
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
clasping
his
hands
,
"
that
no
one
near
and
dear
to
me
is
in
this
dreadful
town
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
May
He
have
mercy
on
all
who
are
in
danger
!
"
   
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
,
the
bell
at
the
great
gate
sounded
,
and
he
thought
,
"
They
have
come
back
!
"
and
sat
listening
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
there
was
no
loud
irruption
into
the
courtyard
,
as
he
had
expected
,
and
he
heard
the
gate
clash
again
,
and
all
was
quiet
.
   
<EOS>
The
nervousness
and
dread
that
were
upon
him
inspired
that
vague
uneasiness
respecting
the
Bank
,
which
a
great
change
would
naturally
awaken
,
with
such
feelings
roused
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
well
guarded
,
and
he
got
up
to
go
among
the
trusty
people
who
were
watching
it
,
when
his
door
suddenly
opened
,
and
two
figures
rushed
in
,
at
sight
of
which
he
fell
back
in
amazement
.
   
<EOS>
Lucie
and
her
father
!
 
<EOS>
Lucie
with
her
arms
stretched
out
to
him
,
and
with
that
old
look
of
earnestness
so
concentrated
and
intensified
,
that
it
seemed
as
though
it
had
been
stamped
upon
her
face
expressly
to
give
force
and
power
to
it
in
this
one
passage
of
her
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
?
"
cried
Mr
Lorry
,
breathless
and
confused
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
Lucie
!
 
<EOS>
Manette
!
 
<EOS>
What
has
happened
?
 
<EOS>
What
has
brought
you
here
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
With
the
look
fixed
upon
him
,
in
her
paleness
and
wildness
,
she
panted
out
in
his
arms
,
imploringly
,
"
O
my
dear
friend
!
<EOS>
My
husband
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
husband
,
Lucie
?
"
   
"
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
of
Charles
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
,
in
Paris
?
"
   
"
Has
been
here
some
days
---
three
or
four
---
I
do
n't
know
how
many
---
I
ca
n't
collect
my
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
An
errand
of
generosity
brought
him
here
unknown
to
us
;
he
was
stopped
at
the
barrier
,
and
sent
to
prison
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
uttered
an
irrepressible
cry
.
 
<EOS>
Almost
at
the
same
moment
,
the
beg
of
the
great
gate
rang
again
,
and
a
loud
noise
of
feet
and
voices
came
pouring
into
the
courtyard
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
noise
?
"
said
the
Doctor
,
turning
towards
the
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
look
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Lorry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
look
out
!
 
<EOS>
Manette
,
for
your
life
,
do
n't
touch
the
blind
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
turned
,
with
his
hand
upon
the
fastening
of
the
window
,
and
said
,
with
a
cool
,
bold
smile
:
   
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
I
have
a
charmed
life
in
this
city
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
a
Bastille
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
patriot
in
Paris
---
in
Paris
?
 
<EOS>
In
France
---
who
,
knowing
me
to
have
been
a
prisoner
in
the
Bastille
,
would
touch
me
,
except
to
overwhelm
me
with
embraces
,
or
carry
me
in
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
My
old
pain
has
given
me
a
power
that
has
brought
us
through
the
barrier
,
and
gained
us
news
of
Charles
there
,
and
brought
us
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
it
would
be
so
<EOS>
;
I
knew
I
could
help
Charles
out
of
all
danger
;
I
told
Lucie
<EOS>
so
.
<EOS>
---
What
is
that
noise
?
"
<EOS>
His
hand
was
again
upon
the
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
look
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Lorry
,
absolutely
desperate
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
Lucie
,
my
dear
,
nor
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
got
his
arm
round
her
,
and
held
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
so
terrified
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
I
solemnly
swear
to
you
that
I
know
of
no
harm
having
happened
to
Charles
;
that
I
had
no
suspicion
even
of
his
being
in
this
fatal
place
.
 
<EOS>
What
prison
is
he
in
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
La
Force
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
La
Force
!
 
<EOS>
Lucie
,
my
child
,
if
ever
you
were
brave
and
serviceable
in
your
life
---
and
you
were
always
both
---
you
will
compose
yourself
now
,
to
do
exactly
as
I
bid
you
;
for
more
depends
upon
it
than
you
can
think
,
or
I
can
say
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
help
for
you
in
any
action
on
your
part
to
-
night
;
you
can
not
possibly
stir
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
this
,
because
what
I
must
bid
you
to
do
for
Charles
's
sake
,
is
the
hardest
thing
to
do
of
all
.
<EOS>
You
must
instantly
be
obedient
,
still
,
and
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
let
me
put
you
in
a
room
at
the
back
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
leave
your
father
and
me
alone
for
two
minutes
,
and
as
there
are
Life
and
Death
in
the
world
you
must
not
delay
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
submissive
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
in
your
face
that
you
know
I
can
do
nothing
else
than
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
are
true
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
man
kissed
her
,
and
hurried
her
into
his
room
,
and
turned
the
key
;
then
,
came
hurrying
back
to
the
Doctor
,
and
opened
the
window
and
partly
opened
the
blind
,
and
put
his
hand
upon
the
Doctor
's
arm
,
and
looked
out
with
him
into
the
courtyard
.
   
<EOS>
Looked
out
upon
a
throng
of
men
and
women
:
 
not
enough
in
number
,
or
near
enough
,
to
fill
the
courtyard
:
 
not
more
than
forty
or
fifty
in
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
in
possession
of
the
house
had
let
them
in
at
the
gate
,
and
they
had
rushed
in
to
work
at
the
grindstone
;
it
had
evidently
been
set
up
there
for
their
purpose
,
as
in
a
convenient
and
retired
spot
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
such
awful
workers
,
and
such
awful
work
!
   
<EOS>
The
grindstone
had
a
double
handle
,
and
,
turning
at
it
madly
were
two
men
,
whose
faces
,
as
their
long
hair
Rapped
back
when
the
whirlings
of
the
grindstone
brought
their
faces
up
,
were
more
horrible
and
cruel
than
the
visages
of
the
wildest
savages
in
their
most
barbarous
disguise
.
<EOS>
False
eyebrows
and
false
moustaches
were
stuck
upon
them
,
and
their
hideous
countenances
were
all
bloody
and
sweaty
,
and
all
awry
with
howling
,
and
all
staring
and
glaring
with
beastly
excitement
and
want
of
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
As
these
ruffians
turned
and
turned
,
their
matted
locks
now
flung
forward
over
their
eyes
,
now
flung
backward
over
their
necks
,
some
women
held
wine
to
their
mouths
that
they
might
drink
;
and
what
with
dropping
blood
,
and
what
with
dropping
wine
,
and
what
with
the
stream
of
sparks
struck
out
of
the
stone
,
all
their
wicked
atmosphere
seemed
gore
and
fire
.
 
<EOS>
The
eye
could
not
detect
one
creature
in
the
group
free
from
the
smear
of
blood
.
<EOS>
Shouldering
one
another
to
get
next
at
the
sharpening
-
stone
,
were
men
stripped
to
the
waist
,
with
the
stain
all
over
their
limbs
and
bodies
;
men
in
all
sorts
of
rags
,
with
the
stain
upon
those
rags
;
men
devilishly
set
off
with
spoils
of
women
's
lace
and
silk
and
ribbon
,
with
the
stain
dyeing
those
trifles
through
and
through
.
 
<EOS>
Hatchets
,
knives
,
bayonets
,
swords
,
all
brought
to
be
sharpened
,
were
all
red
with
it
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
hacked
swords
were
tied
to
the
wrists
of
those
who
carried
them
,
with
strips
of
linen
and
fragments
of
dress
:
ligatures
various
in
kind
,
but
all
deep
of
the
one
colour
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
the
frantic
wielders
of
these
weapons
snatched
them
from
the
stream
of
sparks
and
tore
away
into
the
streets
,
the
same
red
hue
was
red
in
their
frenzied
eyes
;
---
eyes
which
any
unbrutalised
beholder
would
have
given
twenty
years
of
life
,
to
petrify
with
a
well
-
directed
gun
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
was
seen
in
a
moment
,
as
the
vision
of
a
drowning
man
,
or
of
any
human
creature
at
any
very
great
pass
,
could
see
a
world
if
it
were
there
.
 
<EOS>
They
drew
back
from
the
window
,
and
the
Doctor
looked
for
explanation
in
his
friend
's
ashy
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
are
,
"
Mr
Lorry
whispered
the
words
,
glancing
fearfully
round
at
the
locked
room
,
"
murdering
the
prisoners
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
are
sure
of
what
you
say
;
if
you
really
have
the
power
you
think
you
have
---
as
I
believe
you
have
---
make
yourself
known
to
these
devils
,
and
get
taken
to
La
Force
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
too
late
,
I
do
n't
know
,
but
let
it
not
be
a
minute
later
!
"
   
<EOS>
Doctor
Manette
pressed
his
hand
,
hastened
bareheaded
out
of
the
room
,
and
was
in
the
courtyard
when
Mr
Lorry
regained
the
blind
.
   
<EOS>
His
streaming
white
hair
,
his
remarkable
face
,
and
the
impetuous
confidence
of
his
manner
,
as
he
put
the
weapons
aside
like
water
,
carried
him
in
an
instant
to
the
heart
of
the
concourse
at
the
stone
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
there
was
a
pause
,
and
a
hurry
,
and
a
murmur
,
and
the
unintelligible
sound
of
his
voice
;
and
then
Mr
Lorry
saw
him
,
surrounded
by
all
,
and
in
the
midst
of
a
line
of
twenty
men
long
,
all
linked
shoulder
to
shoulder
,
and
hand
to
shoulder
,
hurried
out
with
cries
of
---
<EOS>
"
Live
the
Bastille
prisoner
!
 
<EOS>
Help
for
<EOS>
the
Bastille
prisoner
's
kindred
in
La
Force
!
 
<EOS>
Room
for
the
Bastille
prisoner
in
front
there
!
 
<EOS>
Save
the
prisoner
Evremonde
at
La
Force
!
"
and
a
thousand
answering
shouts
.
   
<EOS>
He
closed
the
lattice
again
with
a
fluttering
heart
,
closed
the
window
and
the
curtain
,
hastened
to
Lucie
,
and
told
her
that
her
father
was
assisted
by
the
people
,
and
gone
in
search
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
He
found
her
child
and
Miss
Pross
with
her
;
but
,
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
be
surprised
by
their
appearance
until
a
long
time
afterwards
,
when
he
sat
watching
them
in
such
quiet
as
the
night
knew
.
   
<EOS>
Lucie
had
,
by
that
time
,
fallen
into
a
stupor
on
the
floor
at
his
feet
,
clinging
to
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pross
had
laid
the
child
down
on
his
own
bed
,
and
her
head
had
gradually
fallen
on
the
pillow
beside
her
pretty
charge
.
<EOS>
O
the
long
,
long
night
,
with
the
moans
of
the
poor
wife
!
 
<EOS>
And
O
the
long
,
long
night
,
with
no
return
of
her
father
and
no
tidings
!
   
<EOS>
Twice
more
in
the
darkness
the
bell
at
the
great
gate
sounded
,
and
the
irruption
was
repeated
,
and
the
grindstone
whirled
and
spluttered
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Lucie
,
affrighted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
The
soldiers
'
swords
are
sharpened
there
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
place
is
national
property
now
,
and
used
as
a
kind
of
armoury
,
my
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
Twice
more
in
all
;
but
,
the
last
spell
of
work
was
feeble
and
fitful
.
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
the
day
began
to
dawn
,
and
he
softly
detached
himself
from
the
clasping
hand
,
and
cautiously
looked
out
again
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
,
so
besmeared
that
he
might
have
been
a
sorely
wounded
soldier
creeping
back
to
consciousness
on
a
field
of
slain
,
was
rising
from
the
pavement
by
the
side
of
the
grindstone
,
and
looking
about
him
with
a
vacant
air
.
 
<EOS>
Shortly
,
this
worn
-
out
murderer
descried
in
the
imperfect
light
one
of
the
carriages
of
Monseigneur
,
and
,
staggering
to
that
gorgeous
vehicle
,
climbed
in
at
the
door
,
and
shut
himself
up
to
take
his
rest
on
its
dainty
cushions
.
   
<EOS>
The
great
grindstone
,
Earth
,
had
turned
when
Mr
Lorry
looked
out
again
,
and
the
sun
was
red
on
the
courtyard
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
lesser
grindstone
stood
alone
there
in
the
calm
morning
air
,
with
a
red
upon
it
that
the
sun
had
never
given
,
and
would
never
take
away
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
3
.
<EOS>
The
Shadow
 
One
of
the
first
considerations
which
arose
in
the
business
mind
of
Mr
Lorry
when
business
hours
came
round
,
was
this
:
---
that
he
had
no
right
<EOS>
to
imperil
Tellson
's
by
sheltering
the
wife
of
an
emigrant
prisoner
under
the
Bank
roof
,
His
own
possessions
,
safety
,
life
,
he
would
have
hazarded
for
Lucie
and
her
child
,
without
a
moment
's
demur
;
but
the
great
trust
he
held
was
not
his
own
,
and
as
to
that
business
charge
he
was
a
strict
man
of
business
.
   
<EOS>
At
first
,
his
mind
reverted
to
Defarge
,
and
he
thought
of
finding
out
the
wine
-
shop
again
and
taking
counsel
with
its
master
in
reference
to
the
safest
dwelling
-
place
in
the
distracted
state
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
But
,
the
same
consideration
that
suggested
him
,
repudiated
him
;
he
lived
in
the
most
violent
Quarter
,
and
doubtless
was
influential
there
,
and
deep
in
its
dangerous
workings
.
   
<EOS>
Noon
coming
,
and
the
Doctor
not
returning
,
and
<EOS>
every
minute
's
delay
tending
to
compromise
Tellson
's
<EOS>
,
Mr
Lorry
advised
with
Lucie
.
<EOS>
She
said
that
her
father
had
spoken
of
hiring
a
lodging
for
a
short
term
,
in
that
Quarter
,
near
the
Banking
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
As
there
was
no
business
objection
to
this
,
and
as
he
foresaw
that
even
if
it
were
all
well
with
Charles
,
and
he
were
to
be
released
,
he
could
not
hope
to
leave
the
city
,
Mr
Lorry
went
out
in
quest
of
such
a
lodging
,
and
found
a
suitable
one
,
high
up
in
a
removed
by
-
street
where
the
closed
blinds
in
all
the
other
windows
of
a
high
melancholy
square
of
buildings
marked
deserted
homes
.
   
<EOS>
To
this
lodging
he
at
once
removed
Lucie
and
her
child
,
and
Miss
Pross
:
 
giving
them
what
comfort
he
could
,
and
much
more
than
he
had
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
left
Jerry
with
them
,
as
a
figure
to
fill
a
doorway
that
would
bear
considerable
knocking
on
the
head
,
and
retained
to
his
own
occupations
.
 
<EOS>
A
disturbed
and
doleful
mind
he
brought
to
bear
upon
them
,
and
slowly
and
heavily
the
day
lagged
on
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
It
wore
itself
out
,
and
wore
him
out
with
it
,
until
the
Bank
closed
.
<EOS>
He
was
again
alone
in
his
room
of
the
previous
night
,
considering
what
to
do
next
,
when
he
heard
a
foot
upon
the
stair
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
,
a
man
stood
in
his
presence
,
who
,
with
a
keenly
observant
look
at
him
,
addressed
him
by
his
name
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
servant
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
strongly
made
man
with
dark
curling
hair
,
from
forty
-
five
to
fifty
years
of
age
.
 
<EOS>
For
answer
he
repeated
,
without
any
change
of
emphasis
,
the
words
:
   
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
me
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
you
somewhere
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
at
my
wine
-
shop
?
"
   
<EOS>
Much
interested
and
agitated
,
Mr
Lorry
said
:
 
"
You
come
from
Doctor
Manette
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
from
Doctor
Manette
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
says
he
?
 
<EOS>
What
does
he
send
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
Defarge
gave
into
his
anxious
hand
,
an
open
scrap
of
paper
.
 
<EOS>
It
bore
the
words
in
the
Doctor
's
writing
:
       
<EOS>
"
Charles
is
safe
,
but
I
can
not
safely
leave
this
place
yet
.
     
<EOS>
I
have
obtained
the
favour
that
the
bearer
has
a
short
note
     
from
Charles
to
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
Let
the
bearer
see
his
wife
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
dated
from
La
Force
,
within
an
hour
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
accompany
me
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
joyfully
relieved
after
reading
this
note
aloud
,
"
to
where
his
wife
resides
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
returned
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
Scarcely
noticing
as
yet
,
in
what
a
curiously
reserved
and
mechanical
way
Defarge
spoke
,
Mr
Lorry
put
on
his
hat
<EOS>
and
they
went
down
into
the
courtyard
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
they
found
two
women
;
one
,
knitting
.
   
<EOS>
"
Madame
Defarge
,
surely
!
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
who
had
left
her
in
exactly
the
same
attitude
some
seventeen
years
ago
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
she
,
"
observed
her
husband
.
   
<EOS>
"
Does
Madame
go
with
us
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Lorry
,
seeing
that
she
moved
as
they
moved
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
That
she
may
be
able
to
recognise
the
faces
and
know
the
persons
.
<EOS>
It
is
for
their
safety
.
"
   
<EOS>
Beginning
to
be
struck
by
Defarge
's
manner
,
Mr
Lorry
looked
dubiously
at
him
,
and
led
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
Both
the
women
followed
;
the
second
woman
being
The
Vengeance
.
   
<EOS>
They
passed
through
the
intervening
streets
as
quickly
as
they
might
,
ascended
the
staircase
of
the
new
domicile
,
were
admitted
by
Jerry
,
and
found
Lucie
weeping
,
alone
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
thrown
into
a
transport
by
the
tidings
Mr
Lorry
gave
her
of
her
husband
,
and
clasped
the
hand
that
delivered
his
note
---
<EOS>
little
thinking
what
it
had
been
doing
near
him
in
the
night
,
and
might
,
but
for
a
chance
,
have
done
to
him
.
        
<EOS>
"
DEAREST
,
---
Take
courage
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
well
,
and
your
father
has
      
influence
around
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
answer
this
.
      
<EOS>
Kiss
our
child
for
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
That
was
all
the
writing
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
so
much
,
however
,
to
her
who
received
it
,
that
she
turned
from
Defarge
to
his
wife
,
and
kissed
one
of
the
hands
that
knitted
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
passionate
,
loving
,
thankful
,
womanly
action
,
but
the
hand
made
no
response
---
dropped
cold
and
heavy
,
and
took
to
its
knitting
again
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
its
touch
that
gave
Lucie
a
check
.
<EOS>
She
stopped
in
the
act
of
putting
the
note
in
her
bosom
,
and
,
with
her
hands
yet
at
her
neck
,
looked
terrified
at
Madame
Defarge
.
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
met
the
lifted
eyebrows
and
forehead
with
a
cold
,
impassive
stare
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
striking
in
to
explain
;
"
there
are
frequent
risings
in
the
streets
;
and
,
although
it
is
not
likely
they
will
ever
trouble
you
,
Madame
Defarge
wishes
to
see
those
whom
she
has
the
power
to
protect
at
such
times
,
to
the
end
that
she
may
know
them
---
that
she
may
identify
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
rather
halting
in
his
reassuring
words
,
as
the
stony
manner
of
all
the
three
impressed
itself
upon
him
more
and
more
,
"
I
state
the
case
,
Citizen
Defarge
?
"
   
<EOS>
Defarge
looked
gloomily
at
his
wife
,
and
gave
no
other
answer
than
a
gruff
sound
of
acquiescence
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
,
Lucie
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
doing
all
he
could
to
propitiate
,
by
tone
and
manner
,
"
have
the
dear
child
here
,
and
our
good
Pross
.
 
<EOS>
Our
good
Pross
,
Defarge
,
is
an
English
lady
,
and
knows
no
French
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
lady
in
question
,
whose
rooted
conviction
that
she
was
more
than
a
match
for
any
foreigner
,
was
not
to
be
shaken
by
distress
and
,
danger
,
appeared
with
folded
arms
,
and
observed
in
English
to
The
Vengeance
,
whom
her
eyes
first
encountered
,
"
Well
,
I
am
sure
,
Boldface
!
<EOS>
I
hope
YOU
are
pretty
well
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
also
bestowed
a
British
cough
on
Madame
Defarge
;
but
,
neither
of
the
two
took
much
heed
of
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
his
child
?
"
said
Madame
Defarge
,
stopping
in
her
work
for
the
first
time
,
and
pointing
her
knitting
-
needle
at
little
Lucie
as
if
it
were
the
finger
of
Fate
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
madame
,
"
answered
Mr
Lorry
;
"
this
is
our
poor
prisoner
's
darling
daughter
,
and
only
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
shadow
attendant
on
Madame
Defarge
and
her
party
seemed
to
fall
so
threatening
and
dark
on
the
child
,
that
her
mother
instinctively
kneeled
on
the
ground
beside
her
,
and
held
her
to
her
breast
.
 
<EOS>
The
shadow
attendant
on
Madame
Defarge
and
her
party
seemed
then
to
fall
,
threatening
and
dark
,
on
both
the
mother
and
the
child
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
enough
,
my
husband
,
"
said
Madame
Defarge
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
them
.
<EOS>
We
may
go
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
,
the
suppressed
manner
had
enough
of
menace
in
it
---
not
visible
and
presented
,
but
indistinct
and
withheld
---
to
alarm
Lucie
into
saying
,
as
she
laid
her
appealing
hand
on
Madame
Defarge
's
dress
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
good
to
my
poor
husband
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
do
him
no
harm
.
<EOS>
You
will
help
me
to
see
him
if
you
can
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
husband
is
not
my
business
here
,
"
returned
Madame
Defarge
,
looking
down
at
her
with
perfect
composure
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
daughter
of
your
father
who
is
my
business
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
my
sake
,
then
,
be
merciful
to
my
husband
.
 
<EOS>
For
my
child
's
sake
!
<EOS>
She
will
put
her
hands
together
and
pray
you
to
be
merciful
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
more
afraid
of
you
than
of
these
others
.
"
   
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
received
it
as
a
compliment
,
and
looked
at
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Defarge
,
who
had
been
uneasily
biting
his
thumb
-
nail
and
looking
at
her
,
collected
his
face
into
a
sterner
expression
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
that
your
husband
says
in
that
little
letter
?
"
 
<EOS>
asked
Madame
Defarge
,
with
a
lowering
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Influence
;
he
says
something
touching
influence
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
my
father
,
"
said
Lucie
,
hurriedly
taking
the
paper
from
her
breast
,
but
with
her
alarmed
eyes
on
her
questioner
and
not
on
it
,
"
has
much
influence
around
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Surely
it
will
release
him
!
"
said
Madame
Defarge
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
it
do
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
a
wife
and
mother
,
"
cried
Lucie
,
most
earnestly
,
"
I
implore
you
to
have
pity
on
me
and
not
to
exercise
any
power
that
you
possess
,
against
my
innocent
husband
,
but
to
use
it
in
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
O
sister
-
woman
,
think
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
wife
and
mother
!
"
   
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
looked
,
coldly
as
ever
,
at
the
suppliant
,
and
said
,
turning
to
her
friend
<EOS>
The
Vengeance
:
   
<EOS>
"
The
wives
and
mothers
we
have
been
used
to
see
,
since
we
were
as
little
as
this
child
,
and
much
less
,
have
not
been
greatly
considered
?
 
<EOS>
We
have
known
THEIR
husbands
and
fathers
laid
in
prison
and
kept
from
them
,
often
enough
?
 
<EOS>
All
our
lives
,
we
have
seen
our
sister
-
women
suffer
,
in
themselves
and
in
their
children
,
poverty
,
nakedness
,
hunger
,
thirst
,
sickness
,
misery
,
oppression
and
neglect
of
all
kinds
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
seen
nothing
else
,
"
returned
The
Vengeance
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
borne
this
a
long
time
,
"
said
Madame
Defarge
,
turning
her
eyes
again
upon
Lucie
.
 
<EOS>
"
Judge
you
!
 
<EOS>
Is
it
likely
that
the
trouble
of
one
wife
and
mother
would
be
much
to
us
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
resumed
her
knitting
and
went
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
Vengeance
followed
.
<EOS>
Defarge
went
last
,
and
closed
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Courage
,
my
dear
Lucie
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
as
he
raised
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Courage
,
courage
!
 
<EOS>
So
far
all
goes
well
with
us
---
much
,
much
better
than
it
has
of
late
gone
with
many
poor
souls
.
 
<EOS>
Cheer
up
,
and
have
a
thankful
heart
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
thankless
,
I
hope
,
but
that
dreadful
woman
seems
to
throw
a
shadow
on
me
and
on
all
my
hopes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tut
,
tut
!
"
said
Mr
Lorry
;
"
what
is
this
despondency
in
the
brave
little
breast
?
 
<EOS>
A
shadow
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
No
substance
in
it
,
Lucie
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
But
the
shadow
of
the
manner
of
these
Defarges
was
dark
upon
himself
,
for
all
that
,
and
in
his
secret
mind
it
troubled
him
greatly
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
4
.
<EOS>
Calm
in
Storm
 
<EOS>
Doctor
Manette
did
not
return
until
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
of
his
absence
.
 
<EOS>
So
much
of
what
had
happened
in
that
dreadful
time
as
could
be
kept
from
the
knowledge
of
Lucie
was
so
well
concealed
from
her
,
that
not
until
long
afterwards
,
when
France
and
she
were
far
apart
,
did
she
know
that
eleven
hundred
defenceless
prisoners
of
both
sexes
and
all
ages
had
been
killed
by
the
populace
;
that
four
days
and
nights
had
been
darkened
by
this
deed
of
horror
;
and
that
the
air
around
her
had
been
tainted
by
the
slain
.
 
<EOS>
She
only
knew
that
there
had
been
an
attack
upon
the
prisons
,
that
all
political
prisoners
had
been
in
danger
,
and
that
some
had
been
dragged
out
by
the
crowd
and
murdered
.
   
<EOS>
To
Mr
Lorry
,
the
Doctor
communicated
under
an
injunction
of
secrecy
on
which
he
had
no
need
to
dwell
,
that
the
crowd
had
taken
him
through
a
scene
of
carnage
to
the
prison
of
La
Force
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
in
the
prison
he
had
found
a
self
-
appointed
Tribunal
sitting
,
before
which
the
prisoners
were
brought
singly
,
and
by
which
they
were
rapidly
ordered
to
be
put
forth
to
be
massacred
,
or
to
be
released
,
or
(
in
a
few
cases
)
to
be
sent
back
to
their
cells
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
presented
by
his
conductors
to
this
Tribunal
<EOS>
,
he
had
announced
himself
by
name
and
profession
as
having
been
for
eighteen
years
a
secret
and
unaccused
prisoner
in
the
Bastille
;
that
,
one
of
the
body
so
sitting
in
judgment
had
risen
and
identified
him
,
and
that
this
man
was
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
That
,
hereupon
he
had
ascertained
,
through
the
registers
on
the
table
,
that
his
son
-
in
-
law
was
among
the
living
prisoners
,
and
had
pleaded
hard
to
the
Tribunal
---
of
whom
some
members
were
asleep
and
some
awake
,
some
dirty
with
murder
and
some
clean
,
some
sober
and
some
not
---
<EOS>
for
his
life
and
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
in
the
first
frantic
greetings
lavished
on
himself
as
a
notable
sufferer
under
the
overthrown
system
,
it
had
been
accorded
to
him
to
have
Charles
Darnay
brought
before
the
lawless
Court
,
and
examined
.
 
<EOS>
That
<EOS>
,
he
seemed
on
the
point
of
being
at
once
released
,
when
the
tide
in
his
favour
met
with
some
unexplained
check
(
not
intelligible
to
the
Doctor
)
,
which
led
to
a
few
words
of
secret
conference
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
the
man
sitting
as
President
had
then
informed
Doctor
Manette
that
the
prisoner
must
remain
in
custody
,
but
should
,
for
his
sake
,
be
held
inviolate
in
safe
custody
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
immediately
,
on
a
signal
,
the
prisoner
was
removed
to
the
interior
of
the
prison
again
;
but
,
that
he
,
the
Doctor
,
had
then
so
strongly
pleaded
for
permission
to
remain
and
assure
himself
that
his
son
-
in
-
law
was
,
through
no
malice
or
mischance
,
delivered
to
the
concourse
whose
murderous
yells
outside
the
gate
had
often
drowned
the
proceedings
,
that
he
had
obtained
the
permission
,
and
had
remained
in
that
Hall
of
Blood
until
the
danger
was
over
.
   
<EOS>
The
sights
he
had
seen
there
,
with
brief
snatches
of
food
and
sleep
by
intervals
,
shall
remain
untold
.
 
<EOS>
The
mad
joy
over
the
prisoners
who
were
saved
,
had
astounded
him
scarcely
less
than
the
mad
ferocity
against
those
who
were
cut
to
pieces
.
 
<EOS>
One
prisoner
there
was
,
he
said
,
who
had
been
discharged
into
the
street
free
,
but
at
whom
a
mistaken
savage
had
thrust
a
pike
as
he
passed
out
.
 
<EOS>
Being
besought
to
go
to
him
and
dress
the
wound
,
the
Doctor
had
passed
out
at
the
same
gate
,
and
had
found
him
in
the
arms
of
a
company
of
Samaritans
,
who
were
seated
on
the
bodies
of
their
victims
.
 
<EOS>
With
an
inconsistency
as
monstrous
as
anything
in
this
awful
nightmare
,
they
had
helped
the
healer
,
and
tended
the
wounded
man
with
the
gentlest
solicitude
---
had
made
a
litter
for
him
and
escorted
him
carefully
from
the
spot
---
had
then
caught
up
their
weapons
and
plunged
anew
into
a
butchery
so
dreadful
,
that
the
Doctor
had
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
,
and
swooned
away
in
the
midst
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Lorry
received
these
confidences
,
and
as
he
watched
the
face
of
his
friend
now
sixty
-
two
years
of
age
,
a
misgiving
arose
within
him
that
such
dread
experiences
would
revive
the
old
danger
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
he
had
never
seen
his
friend
in
his
present
aspect
:
 
<EOS>
he
had
never
at
all
known
him
in
his
present
character
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
the
Doctor
felt
,
now
,
that
his
suffering
was
strength
and
power
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
he
felt
that
in
that
sharp
fire
,
he
had
slowly
forged
the
iron
which
could
break
the
prison
door
of
his
daughter
's
husband
,
and
deliver
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
all
tended
to
a
good
end
,
my
friend
;
it
was
not
mere
waste
and
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
As
my
beloved
child
was
helpful
in
restoring
me
to
myself
,
I
will
be
helpful
now
in
restoring
the
dearest
part
of
herself
to
her
;
by
the
aid
of
Heaven
I
will
do
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
Doctor
Manette
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
Jarvis
Lorry
saw
the
kindled
eyes
,
the
resolute
face
,
the
calm
strong
look
and
bearing
of
the
man
whose
life
always
seemed
to
him
to
have
been
stopped
,
like
a
clock
,
for
so
many
years
,
and
then
set
going
again
with
an
energy
which
had
lain
dormant
during
the
cessation
of
its
usefulness
,
he
believed
.
   
<EOS>
Greater
things
than
the
Doctor
had
at
that
time
to
contend
with
,
would
have
yielded
before
his
persevering
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
kept
himself
in
his
place
,
as
a
physician
,
whose
business
was
with
all
degrees
of
mankind
,
bond
and
free
,
rich
and
poor
,
bad
and
good
,
he
used
his
personal
influence
so
wisely
,
that
he
was
soon
the
inspecting
physician
of
three
prisons
,
and
among

He
could
now
assure
Lucie
that
her
husband
was
no
longer
confined
alone
,
but
was
mixed
with
the
general
body
of
prisoners
;
he
saw
her
husband
weekly
,
and
brought
sweet
messages
to
her
,
straight
from
his
lips
;
sometimes
her
husband
himself
sent
a
letter
to
her
(
though
never
by
the
Doctor
's
hand
)
,
but
she
was
not
permitted
to
write
to
him
:
 
for
,
among
the
many
wild
suspicions
of
plots
in
the
prisons
,
the
wildest
of
all
pointed
at
emigrants
who
were
known
to
have
made
friends
or
permanent
connections
abroad
.
   
<EOS>
This
new
life
of
the
Doctor
's
was
an
anxious
life
,
no
doubt
;
still
,
the
sagacious
Mr
Lorry
saw
that
there
was
a
new
sustaining
pride
in
it
.
<EOS>
Nothing
unbecoming
tinged
the
pride
;
it
was
a
natural
and
worthy
one
;
but
he
observed
it
as
a
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
The
Doctor
knew
,
that
up
to
that
time
,
his
imprisonment
had
been
associated
in
the
minds
of
his
daughter
and
his
friend
,
with
his
personal
affliction
,
deprivation
,
and
weakness
.
 
<EOS>
Now
that
this
was
changed
,
and
he
knew
himself
to
be
invested
through
that
old
trial
with
forces
to
which
they
both
looked
for
Charles
's
ultimate
safety
and
deliverance
,
he
became
so
far
exalted
by
the
change
,
that
he
took
the
lead
and
direction
,
and
required
them
as
the
weak
,
to
trust
to
him
as
the
strong
.
 
<EOS>
The
preceding
relative
positions
of
himself
and
Lucie
were
reversed
,
yet
only
as
the
liveliest
gratitude
and
affection
could
reverse
them
,
for
he
could
have
had
no
pride
but
in
rendering
some
service
to
her
who
had
rendered
so
much
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
curious
to
see
,
"
thought
Mr
Lorry
,
in
his
amiably
shrewd
way
,
"
but
all
natural
and
right
<EOS>
;
so
,
take
the
lead
,
my
dear
friend
,
and
keep
it
;
it
could
n't
be
in
better
hands
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
,
though
the
Doctor
tried
hard
,
and
never
ceased
trying
,
to
get
Charles
Darnay
set
at
liberty
,
or
at
least
to
get
him
brought
to
trial
,
the
public
current
of
the
time
set
too
strong
and
fast
for
him
.
<EOS>
The
new
era
began
;
the
king
was
tried
,
doomed
,
and
beheaded
;
the
Republic
of
Liberty
,
Equality
,
Fraternity
,
or
Death
,
declared
for
victory
or
death
against
the
world
in
arms
;
the
black
flag
waved
night
and
day
from
the
great
towers
of
Notre
Dame
;
three
hundred
thousand
men
,
summoned
to
rise
against
the
tyrants
of
the
earth
,
rose
from
all
the
varying
soils
of
France
,
as
if
the
dragon
's
teeth
had
been
sown
broadcast
,
and
had
yielded
fruit
equally
on
hill
and
plain
,
on
rock
,
in
gravel
,
and
alluvial
mud
,
under
the
bright
sky
of
the
South
and
under
the
clouds
of
the
North
,
in
fell
and
forest
,
in
the
vineyards
and
the
olive

grounds
and
among
the
cropped
grass
and
the
stubble
of
the
corn
,
along
the
fruitful
banks
of
the
broad
rivers
,
and
in
the
sand
of
the
sea
-
shore
.
 
<EOS>
What
private
solicitude
could
rear
itself
against
the
deluge
of
the
Year
One
of
Liberty
---
the
deluge
rising
from
below
,
not
falling
from
above
,
and
with
the
windows
of
Heaven
shut
,
not
opened
!
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
pause
,
no
pity
,
no
peace
,
no
interval
of
relenting
rest
,
no
measurement
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
Though
days
and
nights
circled
as
regularly
as
when
time
was
young
,
and
the
evening
and
morning
were
the
first
day
,
other
count
of
time
there
was
none
.
 
<EOS>
Hold
of
it
was
lost
in
the
raging
fever
of
a
nation
,
as
it
is
in
the
fever
of
one
patient
.
<EOS>
Now
,
breaking
the
unnatural
silence
of
a
whole
city
,
the
executioner
showed
the
people
the
head
of
the
king
---
and
now
,
it
seemed
almost
in
the
same
breath
,
the
bead
of
his
fair
wife
which
had
had
eight
weary
months
of
imprisoned
widowhood
and
misery
,
to
turn
it
grey
.
   
<EOS>
And
yet
,
observing
the
strange
law
of
contradiction
which
obtains
in
all
such
cases
,
the
time
was
long
,
while
it
flamed
by
so
fast
.
<EOS>
A
revolutionary
tribunal
in
the
capital
,
and
forty
or
fifty
thousand
revolutionary
committees
all
over
the
land
;
a
law
of
the
Suspected
,
which
struck
away
all
security
for
liberty
or
life
,
and
delivered
over
any
good
and
innocent
person
to
any
bad
and
guilty
one
;
prisons
gorged
with
people
who
had
committed
no
offence
,
and
could
obtain
no
hearing
;
these
things
became
the
established
order
and
nature
of
appointed
things
,
and
seemed
to
be
ancient
usage
before
they
were
many
weeks
old
.
 
<EOS>
Above
all
,
one
hideous
figure
grew
as
familiar
as
if
it
had
been
before
the
general
gaze
from
the
foundations
of
the
world
---
the
figure
of
the
sharp
female
called
La
Guillotine
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
popular
theme
for
jests
;
it
was
the
best
cure
for
headache
,
it
infallibly
prevented
the
hair
from
turning
grey
,
it
imparted
a
peculiar
delicacy
to
the
complexion
,
it
was
the
National
Razor
which
shaved
close
:
 
who
kissed
La
Guillotine
,
looked
through
the
little
window
and
sneezed
into
the
sack
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
sign
of
the
regeneration
of
the
human
race
.
 
<EOS>
It
superseded
the
Cross
.
 
<EOS>
Models
of
it
were
worn
on
breasts
from
which
the
Cross
was
discarded
,
and
it
was
bowed
down
to
and
believed
in
where
the
Cross
was
denied
.
   
<EOS>
It
sheared
off
heads
so
many
,
that
it
,
and
the
ground
it
most
polluted
,
were
a
rotten
red
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
taken
to
pieces
,
like
a
toy
-
puzzle
for
a
young
Devil
,
and
was
put
together
again
when
the
occasion
wanted
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
hushed
the
eloquent
,
struck
down
the
powerful
,
abolished
the
beautiful
and
good
.
 
<EOS>
Twenty
-
two
friends
of
high
public
mark
,
twenty
-
one
living
and
one
dead
<EOS>
,
it
had
lopped
the
heads
off
,
in
one
morning
,
in
as
many
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
The
name
of
the
strong
man
of
Old
Scripture
had
descended
to
the
chief
functionary
who
worked
it
;
but
,
so
armed
,
he
was
stronger
than
his
namesake
,
and
blinder
,
and
tore
away
the
gates
of
God
's
own
Temple
every
day
.
   
<EOS>
Among
these
terrors
,
and
the
brood
belonging
to
them
,
the
Doctor
walked
with
a
steady
head
:
 
confident
in
his
power
,
cautiously
persistent
in
his
end
,
never
doubting
that
he
would
save
Lucie
's
husband
at
last
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
current
of
the
time
swept
by
,
so
strong
and
deep
,
and
carried
the
time
away
so
fiercely
,
that
Charles
had
lain
in
prison
one
year
and
three
months
when
the
Doctor
was
thus
steady
and
confident
.
 
<EOS>
So
much
more
wicked
and
distracted
had
the
Revolution
grown
in
that
December
month
,
that
the
rivers
of
the
South
were
encumbered
with
the
bodies
of
the
violently
drowned
by
night
,
and
prisoners
were
shot
in
lines
and
squares
under
the
southern
wintry
sun
.
<EOS>
Still
,
the
Doctor
walked
among
the
terrors
with
a
steady
head
.
<EOS>
No
man
better
known
than
he
,
in
Paris
at
that
day
;
no
man
in
a
stranger
situation
.
 
<EOS>
Silent
,
humane
,
indispensable
in
hospital
and
prison
,
using
his
art
equally
among
assassins
and
victims
<EOS>
,
he
was
a
man
apart
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
exercise
of
his
skill
,
the
appearance
and
the
story
of
the
Bastille
Captive
removed
him
from
all
other
men
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
suspected
or
brought
in
question
,
any
more
than
if
he
bad
indeed
been
recalled
to
life
some
eighteen
years
before
,
or
were
a
Spirit
moving
among
mortals

One

During
all
that

Lucie
was
never
sure
,
from
hour
to
hour
,
but
that
the
Guillotine
would
strike
off
her
husband
's
head
next
day

<EOS>
Every
day

through
the
stony
streets

the
tumbrils
now
jolted
heavily

filled
with
Condemned

Lovely

bright

black

gentle

all
red

for
La
Guillotine
,
all
daily
brought
into
light
from
the
dark
cellars
of
the
loathsome
prisons
,
and
carried
to
her
through
the
streets
to
slake
her
devouring
thirst
.
 
<EOS>
Liberty
,
equality
,
fraternity
,
or
death
;
---
the
last
,
much
the
easiest
to
bestow
,
O
Guillotine
!
   
<EOS>
If
the
suddenness
of
her
calamity
,
and
the
whirling
wheels
of
the
time
,
had
stunned
the
Doctor
's
daughter
into
awaiting
the
result
in
idle
despair
,
it
would
but
have
been
with
her
as
it
was
with
many
.
<EOS>
But
,
from
the
hour
when
she
had
taken
the
white
head
to
her
fresh
young
bosom
in
the
garret
of
Saint
Antoine
,
she
had
been
true
to
her
duties
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
truest
to
them
in
the
season
of
trial
,
as
all
the
quietly
loyal
and
good
will
always
be
.
   
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
were
established
in
their
new
residence
,
and
her
father
had
entered
on
the
routine
of
his
avocations
,
she
arranged
the
little
household
as
exactly
as
if
her
husband
had
been
there
.
<EOS>
Everything
had
its
appointed
place
and
its
appointed
time
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Lucie
she
taught
,
as
regularly
,
as
if
they
had
all
been
united
in
their
English
home
.
 
<EOS>
The
slight
devices
with
which
she
cheated
herself
into
the
show
of
a
belief
that
they
would
soon
be
reunited
---
the
little
preparations
for
his
speedy
return
,
the
setting
aside
of
his
chair
and
his
books
---
these
,
and
the
solemn
prayer
at
night
for
one
dear
prisoner
especially
,
among
the
many
unhappy
souls
in
prison
and
the
shadow
of
death
---
were
almost
the
only
outspoken
reliefs
of
her
heavy
mind
.
   
<EOS>
She
did
not
greatly
alter
in
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
The
plain
dark
dresses
,
akin
to
mourning
dresses
,
which
she
and
her
child
wore
,
were
as
neat
and
as
well
attended
to
as
the
brighter
clothes
of
happy
days
.
<EOS>
She
lost
her
colour
,
and
the
old
and
intent
expression
was
a
constant
,
not
an
occasional
,
thing
;
otherwise
,
she
remained
very
pretty
and
comely
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
at
night
on
kissing
her
father
,
she
would
burst
into
the
grief
she
had
repressed
all
day
,
and
would
say
that
her
sole
reliance
,
under
Heaven
,
was
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
resolutely
answered
:
"
Nothing
can
happen
to
him
without
my
knowledge
,
and
I
know
that
I
can
save
him
,
Lucie
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
had
not
made
the
round
of
their
changed
life
many
weeks
,
when
her
father
said
to
her
,
on
coming
home
one
evening
:
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
there
is
an
upper
window
in
the
prison
,
to
which
Charles
can
sometimes
gain
access
at
three
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
can
get
to
it
---
<EOS>
which
depends
on
many
uncertainties
and
incidents
---
he
might
see
you
in
the
street
,
he
thinks
,
if
you
stood
in
a
certain
place
that
I
can
show
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
will
not
be
able
to
see
him
,
my
poor
child
,
and
even
if
you
could
,
it
would
be
unsafe
for
you
to
make
a
sign
of
recognition
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
show
me
the
place
,
my
father
,
and
I
will
go
there
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
From
that
time
,
in
all
weathers
,
she
waited
there
two
hours
.
<EOS>
As
the
clock
struck
two
,
she
was
there
,
and
at
four
she
turned
resignedly
away
.
<EOS>
When
it
was
not
too
wet
or
inclement
for
her
child
to
be
with
her
,
they
went
together
;
at
other
times
she
was
alone
;
but
,
she
never
missed
a
single
day
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
dark
and
dirty
corner
of
a
small
winding
street
.
<EOS>
The
hovel
of
a
cutter
of
wood
into
lengths
for
burning
,
was
the
only
house
at
that
end
;
all
else
was
wall
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
third
day
of
her
being
there
,
he
noticed
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good

<EOS>
"
Good

This
mode

address
was
now
prescribed
by
decree

<EOS>
It
had
been
established
voluntarily
some
time
ago

among

more
thorough

was

The

who
was
a
little
man
with
a
redundancy
of
gesture
<EOS>
(
he
had
once
been
a
mender
of
roads
)
,
cast
a
glance
at
the
prison
,
pointed
at
the
prison
,
and
putting
his
ten
fingers
before
his
face
to
represent

peeped
through

jocosely

<EOS>
"
But

he

And
went
on
sawing
his
wood

Next
day
he
was
looking
out
for

accosted
her
the
moment
she
appeared

The

fell
as

threw
it
into

Lucie
shuddered
as
he
threw
two
more
billets
into
his
basket
,
but
it
was
impossible
to
be
there
while
the
wood
-
sawyer
was
at
work
,
and
not
be
in
his
sight
.
 
<EOS>
Thenceforth
,
to
secure
his
good
will
,
she
always
spoke
to
him
first
,
and
often
gave
him
drink
-
money
,
which
he
readily
received
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
an
inquisitive
fellow
,
and
sometimes
when
she
had
quite
forgotten
him
in
gazing
at
the
prison
roof
and
grates
,
and
in
lifting
her
heart
up
to
her
husband
,
she
would
come
to
herself
to
find
him
looking
at
her
,
with
his
knee
on
his
bench
and
his
saw
stopped
in
its
work
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
not
my
business
!
"
<EOS>
he
would
generally
say
at
those
times
,
and
would
briskly
fall
to
his
sawing
again
.
   
<EOS>
In
all
weathers
,
in
the
snow
and
frost
of
winter
,
in
the
bitter
winds
of
spring
,
in
the
hot
sunshine
of
summer
,
in
the
rains
of
autumn
,
and
again
in
the
snow
and
frost
of
winter
,
Lucie
passed
two
hours
of
every
day
at
this
place
;
and
every
day
on
leaving
it
,
she
kissed
the
prison
wall
.
 
<EOS>
Her
husband
saw
her
(
so
she
learned
from
her
father
)
<EOS>
it
might
be
once
in
five
or
six
times
:
 
it
might
be
twice
or
thrice
running
:
it
might
be
,
not
for
a
week
or
a
fortnight
together
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
enough
that
he
could
and
did
see
her
when
the
chances
served
,
and
on
that
possibility
she
would
have
waited
out
the
day
,
seven
days
a
week
.
   
<EOS>
These
occupations
brought
her
round
to
the
December
month
,
wherein
her
father
walked
among
the
terrors
with
a
steady
head
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
lightly
-
snowing
afternoon
she
arrived
at
the
usual
corner
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
day
of
some
wild
rejoicing
,
and
a
festival
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
seen
the
houses
,
as
she
came
along
,
decorated
with
little
pikes
,
and
with
little
red
caps
stuck
upon
them
;
also
,
with
tricoloured
ribbons
;
also
,
with
the
standard
inscription
<EOS>
(
tricoloured
letters
were
the
favourite
)
,
Republic
One
and
Indivisible
.
<EOS>
Liberty
,
Equality
,
Fraternity
,
or
Death
!
   
<EOS>
The
miserable
shop
of
the
wood
-
sawyer
was
so
small
,
that
its
whole
surface
furnished
very
indifferent
space
for
this
legend
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
got
somebody
to
scrawl
it
up
for
him
,
however
,
who
had
squeezed
Death
in
with
most
inappropriate
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
house
-
top
,
he
displayed
pike
and
cap
,
as
a
good
citizen
must
,
and
in
a
window
he
had
stationed
his
saw
inscribed
as
his
"
Little
Sainte
Guillotine
"
---
for
the
great
sharp
female
was
by
that
time
popularly
canonised
.
<EOS>
His
shop
was
shut
and
he
was
not
there
,
which
was
a
relief
to
Lucie
,
and
left
her
quite
alone
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
he
was
not
far
off
,
for
presently
she
heard
a
troubled
movement
and
a
shouting
coming
along
,
which
filled
her
with
fear
.
 
<EOS>
A
moment
afterwards
,
and
a
throng
of
people
came
pouring
round
the
corner
by
the
prison
wall
,
in
the
midst
of
whom
was
the
wood
-
sawyer
hand
in
hand
with
The
Vengeance
.
 
<EOS>
There
could
not
be
fewer
than
five
hundred
people
,
and
they
were
dancing
like
five
thousand
demons
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
other
music
than
their
own
singing
.
 
<EOS>
They
danced
to
the
popular
Revolution
song
,
keeping
a
ferocious
time
that
was
like
a
gnashing
of
teeth
in
unison
.
 
<EOS>
Men
and
women
danced
together
,
women
danced
together
,
men
danced
together
,
as
hazard
had
brought
them
together
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
they
were
a
mere
storm
of
coarse
red
caps
and
coarse
woollen
rags
;
but
,
as
they
filled
the
place
,
and
stopped
to
dance
about
Lucie
,
some
ghastly
apparition
of
a
dance
-
figure
gone
raving
mad
arose
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
advanced
,
retreated
,
struck
at
one
another
's
hands
,
clutched
at
one
another
's
heads
,
spun
round
alone
,
caught
one
another
and
spun
round
in
pairs
,
until
many
of
them
dropped
.
 
<EOS>
While
those
were
down
,
the
rest
linked
hand
in
hand
,
and
all
spun
round
together
:
 
then
the
ring
broke
,
and
in
separate
rings
of
two
and
four
they
turned
and
turned
until
they
all
stopped
at
once
,
began
again
,
struck
,
clutched
,
and
tore
,
and
then
reversed
the
spin
,
and
all
spun
round
another
way
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
they
stopped
again
,
paused
,
struck
out
the
time
afresh
,
formed
into
lines
the
width
of
the
public
way
,
and
,
with
their
heads
low
down
and
their
hands
high
up
,
swooped
screaming
off
.
 
<EOS>
No
fight
could
have
been
half
so
terrible
as
this
dance
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
so
emphatically
a
fallen
sport
---
a
something
,
once
innocent
,
delivered
over
to
all
devilry
---
a
healthy
pastime
changed
into
a
means
of
angering
the
blood
,
bewildering
the
senses
,
and
steeling
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Such
grace
as
was
visible
in
it
,
made
it
the
uglier
,
showing
how
warped
and
perverted
all
things
good
by
nature
were
become
.
 
<EOS>
The
maidenly
bosom
bared
to
this
,
the
pretty
almost
-
child
's
head
thus
distracted
,
the
delicate
foot
mincing
in
this
slough
of
blood
and
dirt
,
were
types
of
the
disjointed
time
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
the
Carmagnole
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
passed
,
leaving
Lucie
frightened
and
bewildered
in
the
doorway
of
the
wood
-
sawyer
's
house
,
the
feathery
snow
fell
as
quietly
and
lay
as
white
and
soft
,
as
if
it
had
never
been
.
   
<EOS>
"
O
my
father
!
"
<EOS>
for
he
stood
before
her
when
she
lifted
up
the
eyes
she
had
momentarily
darkened
with
her
hand
;
"
such
a
cruel
,
bad
sight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
my
dear
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
it
many
times
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
frightened
!
 
<EOS>
Not
one
of
them
would
harm
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
frightened
for
myself
,
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
I
think
of
my
husband
,
and
the
mercies
of
these
people
---
"
   
"
We
will
set
him
above
their
mercies
very
soon
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
him
climbing
to
the
window
,
and
I
came
to
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
one
here
to
see
.
<EOS>
You
may
kiss
your
hand
towards
that
highest
shelving
roof
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
so
,
father
,
and
I
send
him
my
Soul
with
it
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
see
him
,
my
poor
dear
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
father
,
"
said
Lucie
,
yearning
and
weeping
as
she
kissed
her
hand
,
"
no
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
footstep
in

Nothing
more

Madame
Defarge
gone

like
a
shadow
over
the
white
road

<EOS>
"
Give
me
your

<EOS>
Pass
from
here
with
an
air
of
cheerfulness
and
courage
,
for
his
sake
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
well
done
;
"
they
had
left
the
spot
;
"
it
shall
not
be
in
vain

summoned
for

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
to

morrow
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
time
to
lose
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
well
prepared
,
but
there
are
precautions
to
be
taken
<EOS>
,
that
could
not
be
taken
until
he
was
actually
summoned
before
the
Tribunal
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
not
received
the
notice
yet
,
but
I
know
that
he
will
presently
be
summoned
for
to
-
morrow
,
and
removed
to
the
Conciergerie
;
I
have
timely
information
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
afraid
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
could
scarcely
answer
,
"
I
trust
in
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
so
,
implicitly
.
 
<EOS>
Your
suspense
is
nearly
ended
,
my
darling
;
he
shall
be
restored
to
you
within
a
few
hours
;
I
have
encompassed
him
with
every
protection
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
see
Lorry
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
heavy
lumbering
of
wheels
within
hearing
.
<EOS>
They
both
knew
too
well
what
it
meant
.
 
<EOS>
One
.
 
<EOS>
Two
.
 
<EOS>
Three
.
 
<EOS>
Three
tumbrils
faring
away
with
their
dread
loads
over
the
hushing
snow
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
Lorry
,
"
the
Doctor
repeated
,
turning
her
another
way
.
   
<EOS>
The
staunch
old
gentleman
was
still
in
his
trust
;
had
never
left
it
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
books
were
in
frequent
requisition
as
to
property
confiscated
and
made
national
.
 
<EOS>
What
he
could
save
for
the
owners
,
he
saved
.
 
<EOS>
No
better
man
living
to
hold
fast
by
what
Tellson
's
had
in
keeping
,
and
to
hold
his
peace
.
   
<EOS>
A
murky
red
and
yellow
sky
,
and
a
rising
mist
from
the
Seine
,
denoted
the
approach
of
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
almost
dark
when
they
arrived
at
the
Bank
.
 
<EOS>
The
stately
residence
of
Monseigneur
was
altogether
blighted
and
deserted
.
 
<EOS>
Above
a
heap
of
dust
and
ashes
in
the
court
,
ran
the
letters
:
 
National
Property
.
 
<EOS>
Republic
One
and
Indivisible
.
<EOS>
Liberty
,
Equality
,
Fraternity
,
or
Death

<EOS>
Who
could
that
be
with
Mr
Lorry
---
the
owner
of
the
riding
-
coat
upon
the
chair
---
who
must
not
be
seen
?
 
<EOS>
From
whom
newly
arrived
,
did
he
come
out
,
agitated
and
surprised
,
to
take
his
favourite
in
his
arms
?
 
<EOS>
To
whom
did
he
appear
to
repeat
her
faltering
words
,
when
,
raising
his
voice
and
turning
his
head
towards
the
door
of
the
room
from
which
he
had
issued
,
he
said
:
 
<EOS>
"
Removed
to
the
Conciergerie
,
and
summoned
for
to

Chapter

.
<EOS>
Triumph
 
<EOS>
The
dread
tribunal
of
five
Judges
,
Public
Prosecutor
,
and
determined
Jury
,
sat
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
Their
lists
went
forth
every
evening
,
and
were
read
out
by
the
gaolers
of
the
various
prisons
to
their
prisoners
.
<EOS>
The
standard
gaoler
-
joke
was
,
"
Come
out
and
listen
to
the
Evening
Paper
,
you
inside
there
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Charles
Evremonde
,
called
Darnay
!
"
   
<EOS>
So
at
last
began
the
Evening
Paper
at
La
Force
.
   
<EOS>
When
a
name
was
called
,
its
owner
stepped
apart
into
a
spot
reserved
for
those
who
were
announced
as
being
thus
fatally
recorded
.
 
<EOS>
Charles
Evremonde
,
called
Darnay
,
had
reason
to
know
the
usage
;
he
had
seen
hundreds
pass
away
so
.
   
<EOS>
His
bloated
gaoler
,
who
wore
spectacles
to
read
with
,
glanced
over
them
to
assure
himself
that
he
had
taken
his
place
,
and
went
through
the
list
,
making
a
similar
short
pause
at
each
name
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
twenty
-
three
names
,
but
only
twenty
were
responded
to
;
for
one
of
the
prisoners
so
summoned
had
died
in
gaol
and
been
forgotten
,
and
two
had
already
been
guillotined
and
forgotten
.
 
<EOS>
The
list
was
read
,
in
the
vaulted
chamber
where
Darnay
had
seen
the
associated
prisoners
on
the
night
of
his
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
Every
one
of
those
had
perished
in
the
massacre
;
every
human
creature
he
had
since
cared
for
and
parted
with
,
had
died
on
the
scaffold
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
hurried
words
of
farewell
and
kindness
,
but
the
parting
was
soon
over
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
incident
of
every
day
,
and
the
society
of
La
Force
were
engaged
in
the
preparation
of
some
games
of
forfeits
and
a
little
concert
,
for
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
They
crowded
to
the
grates
and
shed
tears
there
;
but
,
twenty
places
in
the
projected
entertainments
had
to
be
refilled
,
and
the
time
was
,
at
best
,
short
to
the
lock
-
up
hour
,
when
the
common
rooms
and
corridors
would
be
delivered
over
to
the
great
dogs
who
kept
watch
there
through
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
prisoners
were
far
from
insensible
or
unfeeling
;
their
ways
arose
out
of
the
condition
of
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
Similarly
,
though
with
a
subtle
difference
,
a
species
of
fervour
or
intoxication
,
known
,
without
doubt
,
to
have
led
some
persons
to
brave
the
guillotine
unnecessarily
,
and
to
die
by
it
,
was
not
mere
boastfulness
,
but
a
wild
infection
of
the
wildly
shaken
public
mind
.
 
<EOS>
In
seasons
of
pestilence
,
some
of
us
will
have
a
secret
attraction
to
the
disease
---
a
terrible
passing
inclination
to
die
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
all
of
us
have
like
wonders
hidden
in
our
breasts
,
only
needing
circumstances
to
evoke
them
.
   
<EOS>
The
passage
to
the
Conciergerie
was
short
and
dark
;
the
night
in
its
vermin
-
haunted
cells
was
long
and
cold
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
,
fifteen
prisoners
were
put
to
the
bar
before
Charles
Darnay
's
name
was
called
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
fifteen
were
condemned
,
and
the
trials
of
the
whole
occupied
an
hour
and
a
half
.
   
<EOS>
"
Charles
Evremonde
,
called
Darnay
,
"
was
at
length
arraigned
.
   
<EOS>
His
judges
sat
upon
the
Bench
in
feathered
hats
;
but
the
rough
red
cap
and
tricoloured
cockade
was
the
head
-
dress
otherwise
prevailing
.
<EOS>
Looking
at
the
Jury
and
the
turbulent
audience
,
he
might
have
thought
that
the
usual
order
of
things
was
reversed
,
and
that
the
felons
were
trying
the
honest
men
.
 
<EOS>
The
lowest
,
cruelest
,
and
worst
populace
of
a
city
,
never
without
its
quantity
of
low
,
cruel
,
and
bad
,
were
the
directing
spirits
of
the
scene
:
 
noisily
commenting
,
applauding
,
disapproving
,
anticipating
,
and
precipitating
the
result
,
without
a
check
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
men
,
the
greater
part
were
armed
in
various
ways
<EOS>
;
of
the
women
,
some
wore
knives
,
some
daggers
,
some
ate
and
drank
as
they
looked
on
,
many
knitted
.
 
<EOS>
Among
these
last
,
was
one
,
with
a
spare
piece
of
knitting
under
her
arm
as
she
worked
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
in
a
front
row
,
by
the
side
of
a
man
whom
he
had
never
seen
since
his
arrival
at
the
Barrier
,
but
whom
he
directly
remembered
as
Defarge
.
 
<EOS>
He
noticed
that
she
once
or
twice
whispered
in
his
ear
,
and
that
she
seemed
to
be
his
wife
;
but
,
what
he
most
noticed
in
the
two
figures
was
,
that
although
they
were
posted
as
close
to
himself
as
they
could
be
,
they
never
looked
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
something
with
a
dogged
determination
,
and
they
looked
at
the
Jury
,
but
at
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
Under
the
President
sat
Doctor
Manette
,
in
his
usual
quiet
dress
.
 
<EOS>
As
well
as
the
prisoner
could
see
,
he
and
Mr
Lorry
were
the
only
men
there
,
unconnected
with
the
Tribunal
,
who
wore
their
usual
clothes
,
and
had
not
assumed
the
coarse
garb
of
the
Carmagnole
.
   
<EOS>
Charles
Evremonde
,
called
Darnay
,
was
accused
by
the
public
prosecutor
as
an
emigrant
,
whose
life
was
forfeit
to
the
Republic
,
under
the
decree
which
banished
all
emigrants
on
pain
of
Death
.
<EOS>
It
was
nothing
that
the
decree
bore
date
since
his
return
to
France
.
<EOS>
There
he
was
,
and
there
was
the
decree
;
he
had
been
taken
in
France
,
and
his
head
was
demanded
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
off
his
head
!
"
cried
the
audience
.
 
<EOS>
"
An
enemy
to
the
Republic
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
President
rang
his
bell
to
silence
those
cries
,
and
asked
the
prisoner
whether
it
was
not
true
that
he
had
lived
many
years
in
England
?
   
<EOS>
Undoubtedly
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
Was
he
not
an
emigrant
then
?
 
<EOS>
What
did
he
call
himself
?
   
<EOS>
Not
an
emigrant
,
he
hoped
,
within
the
sense
and
spirit
of
the
law
.
   
<EOS>
Why
not
?
 
<EOS>
the
President
desired
to
know
.
   
<EOS>
Because
he
had
voluntarily
relinquished
a
title
that
was
distasteful
to
him
,
and
a
station
that
was
distasteful
to
him
,
and
had
left
his
country
---
he
submitted
before
the
word
emigrant
in
the
present
acceptation
by
the
Tribunal
was
in
use
---
to
live
by
his
own
industry
in
England
,
rather
than
on
the
industry
of
the
overladen
people
of
France
.
   
<EOS>
What
proof
had
he
of
this
?
   
<EOS>
He
handed
in
the
names
of
two
witnesses
;
Theophile
Gabelle
,
and
Alexandre
Manette
.
   
<EOS>
But
he
had
married
in
England
?
 
<EOS>
the
President
reminded
him
.
   
<EOS>
True
,
but
not
an
English
woman
.
   
<EOS>
A
citizeness
of
France
?
   
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
By
birth
.
   
<EOS>
Her
name
and
family
?
   
<EOS>
"
Lucie
Manette
,
only
daughter
of
Doctor
Manette
,
the
good
physician
who
sits
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
answer
had
a
happy
effect
upon
the
audience
.
 
<EOS>
Cries
in
exaltation
of
the
well
-
known
good
physician
rent
the
hall
.
 
<EOS>
So
capriciously
were
the
people
moved
,
that
tears
immediately
rolled
down
several
ferocious
countenances
which
had
been
glaring
at
the
prisoner
a
moment
before
,
as
if
with
impatience
to
pluck
him
out
into
the
streets
and
kill
him
.
   
<EOS>
On
these
few
steps
of
his
dangerous
way
,
Charles
Darnay
had
set
his
foot
according
to
Doctor
Manette
's
reiterated
instructions
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
cautious
counsel
directed
every
step
that
lay
before
him
,
and
had
prepared
every
inch
of
his
road
.
   
<EOS>
The
President
asked
,
why
had
he
returned
to
France
when
he
did
,
and
not
sooner
?
   
<EOS>
He
had
not
returned
sooner
,
he
replied
,
simply
because
he
had
no
means
of
living
in
France
,
save
those
he
had
resigned
;
whereas
,
in
England
,
he
lived
by
giving
instruction
in
the
French
language
and
literature
.
<EOS>
He
had
returned
when
he
did
,
on
the
pressing
and
written
entreaty
of
a
French
citizen
,
who
represented
that
his
life
was
endangered
by
his
absence
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
come
back
,
to
save
a
citizen
's
life
,
and
to
bear
his
testimony
,
at
whatever
personal
hazard
,
to
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Was
that
criminal
in
the
eyes
of
the
Republic
?
   
<EOS>
The
populace
cried
enthusiastically
,
"
No
!
"
and
the
President
rang
his
bell
to
quiet
them
.
 
<EOS>
Which
it
did
not
,
for
they
continued
to
cry
"
No
!
"
<EOS>
until
they
left
off
,
of
their
own
will
.
   
<EOS>
The
President
required
the
name
of
that
citizen
.
 
<EOS>
The
accused
explained
that
the
citizen
was
his
first
witness
.
 
<EOS>
He
also
referred
with
confidence
to
the
citizen
's
letter
,
which
had
been
taken
from
him
at
the
Barrier
,
but
which
he
did
not
doubt
would
be
found
among
the
papers
then
before
the
President
.
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
had
taken
care
that
it
should
be
there
---
had
assured
him
that
it
would
be
there
---
and
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
it
was
produced
and
read
.
 
<EOS>
Citizen
Gabelle
was
called
to
confirm
it
,
and
did
so
.
<EOS>
Citizen
Gabelle
hinted
,
with
infinite
delicacy
and
politeness
,
that
in
the
pressure
of
business
imposed
on
the
Tribunal
by
the
multitude
of
enemies
of
the
Republic
with
which
it
had
to
deal
,
he
had
been
slightly
overlooked
in
his
prison
of
the
Abbaye
---
in
fact
,
had
rather
passed
out
of
the
Tribunal
's
patriotic
remembrance
---
until
three
days
ago
;
when
he
had
been
summoned
before
it
,
and
had
been
set
at
liberty
on
the
Jury
's
declaring
themselves
satisfied
that
the
accusation
against
him
was
answered
,
as
to
himself
,
by
the
surrender
of
the
citizen
Evremonde
,
called
Darnay
.
   
<EOS>
Doctor
Manette
was
next
questioned
.
 
<EOS>
His
high
personal
popularity
,
and
the
clearness
of
his
answers
,
made
a
great
impression
;
but
,
as
he
proceeded
,
as
he
showed
that
the
Accused
was
his
first
friend
on
his
release
from
his
long
imprisonment
;
that
,
the
accused
had
remained
in
England
,
always
faithful
and
devoted
to
his
daughter
and
himself
in
their
exile
;
that
,
so
far
from
being
in
favour
with
the
Aristocrat
government
there
,
he
had
actually
been
tried
for
his
life
by
it
,
as
the
foe
of
England
and
friend
of
the
United
States
---
as
he
brought
these
circumstances
into
view
,
with
the
greatest
discretion
and
with
the
straightforward
force
of
truth
and
earnestness
,
the
Jury
and
the
populace
became
one
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
when
he
appealed
by
name
to
Monsieur
Lorry
,
an
English
gentleman
then
and
there
present
,
who
,
like
himself
,
had
been
a
witness
on
that
English
trial
and
could
corroborate
his
account
of
it
,
the
Jury
declared
that
they
had
heard
enough
,
and
that
they
were
ready
with
their
votes
if
the
President
were
content
to
receive
them
.
   
<EOS>
At
every
vote
(
the
Jurymen
voted
aloud
and
individually
)
,
the
populace
set
up
a
shout
of
applause
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
voices
were
in
the
prisoner
's
favour
,
and
the
President
declared
him
free
.
   
<EOS>
Then
,
began
one
of
those
extraordinary
scenes
with
which
the
populace
sometimes
gratified
their
fickleness
,
or
their
better
impulses
towards
generosity
and
mercy
,
or
which
they
regarded
as
some
set
-
off
against
their
swollen
account
of
cruel
rage
.
 
<EOS>
No
man
can
decide
now
to
which
of
these
motives
such
extraordinary
scenes
were
referable
;
it
is
probable
,
to
a
blending
of
all
the
three
,
with
the
second
predominating
.
 
<EOS>
No
sooner
was
the
acquittal
pronounced
,
than
tears
were
shed
as
freely
as
blood
at
another
time
,
and
such
fraternal
embraces
were
bestowed
upon
the
prisoner
by
as
many
of
both
sexes
as
could
rush
at
him
,
that
after
his
long
and
unwholesome
confinement
he
was
in
danger
of
fainting
from
exhaustion
;
none
the
less
because
he
knew
very
well
,
that
the
very
same
people
,
carried
by
another
current
,
would
have
rushed
at
him
with
the
very
same
intensity
,
to
rend
him
to
pieces
and
strew
him
over
the
streets
.
   
<EOS>
His
removal
,
to
make
way
for
other
accused
persons
who
were
to
be
tried
,
rescued
him
from
these
caresses
for
the
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Five
were
to
be
tried
together
,
next
,
as
enemies
of
the
Republic
,
forasmuch
as
they
had
not
assisted
it
by
word
or
deed
.
 
<EOS>
So
quick
was
the
Tribunal
to
compensate
itself
and
the
nation
for
a
chance
lost
,
that
these
five
came
down
to
him
before
he
left
the
place
,
condemned
to
die
within
twenty
-
four
hours
.
<EOS>
The
first
of
them
told
him
so
,
with
the
customary
prison
sign
of
Death
---
a
raised
finger
---
and
they
all
added
in
words
,
"
Long
live
the
Republic
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
five
had
had
,
it
is
true
,
no
audience
to
lengthen
their
proceedings
,
for
when
he
and
Doctor
Manette
emerged
from
the
gate
,
there
was
a
great
crowd
about
it
,
in
which
there
seemed
to
be
every
face
he
had
seen
in
Court
---
except
two
,
for
which
he
looked
in
vain
.
<EOS>
On
his
coming
out
,
the
concourse
made
at
him
anew
,
weeping
,
embracing
,
and
shouting
,
all
by
turns
and
all
together
,
until
the
very
tide
of
the
river
on
the
bank
of
which
the
mad
scene
was
acted
,
seemed
to
run
mad
,
like
the
people
on
the
shore
.
   
<EOS>
They
put
him
into
a
great
chair
they
had
among
them
,
and
which
they
had
taken
either
out
of
the
Court
itself
,
or
one
of
its
rooms
or
passages
.
 
<EOS>
Over
the
chair
they
had
thrown
a
red
flag
,
and
to
the
back
of
it
they
had
bound
a
pike
with
a
red
cap
on
its
top
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
car
of
triumph
,
not
even
the
Doctor
's
entreaties
could
prevent
his
being
carried
to
his
home
on
men
's
shoulders
,
with
a
confused
sea
of
red
caps
heaving
about
him
,
and
casting
up
to
sight
from
the
stormy
deep
such
wrecks
of
faces
,
that
he
more
than
once
misdoubted
his
mind
being
in
confusion
,
and
that
he
was
in
the
tumbril
on
his
way
to
the
Guillotine
.
   
<EOS>
In
wild
dreamlike
procession
,
embracing
whom
they
met
and
pointing
him
out
,
they
carried
him
on
.
 
<EOS>
Reddening
the
snowy
streets
with
the
prevailing
Republican
colour
,
in
winding
and
tramping
through
them
,
as
they
had
reddened
them
below
the
snow
with
a
deeper
dye
,
they
carried
him
thus
into
the
courtyard
of
the
building
where
he
lived
.
<EOS>
Her
father
had
gone
on
before
,
to
prepare
her
,
and
when
her
husband
stood
upon
his
feet
,
she
dropped
insensible
in
his
arms
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
held
her
to
his
heart
and
turned
her
beautiful
head
between
his
face
and
the
brawling
crowd
,
so
that
his
tears
and
her
lips
might
come
together
unseen
,
a
few
of
the
people
fell
to
dancing
.
<EOS>
Instantly
,
all
the
rest
fell
to
dancing
,
and
the
courtyard
overflowed
with
the
Carmagnole
.
<EOS>
Then
,
they
elevated
into
the
vacant
chair
a
young
woman
from
the
crowd
to
be
carried
as
the
Goddess
of
Liberty
,
and
then
swelling
and
overflowing
out
into
the
adjacent
streets
,
and
along
the
river
's
bank
,
and
over
the
bridge
,
the
Carmagnole
absorbed
them
every
one
and
whirled
them
away
.
   
<EOS>
After
grasping
the
Doctor
's
hand
,
as
he
stood
victorious
and
proud
before
him
;
after
grasping
the
hand
of
Mr
Lorry
,
who
came
panting
in
breathless
from
his
struggle
against
the
waterspout
of
the
Carmagnole
;
after
kissing
little
Lucie
,
who
was
lifted
up
to
clasp
her
arms
<EOS>
round
his
neck
;
and
after
embracing
the
ever
zealous
and
faithful
Pross
who
lifted
her
;
he
took
his
wife
in
his
arms
,
and
carried
her
up
to
their
rooms
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lucie
!
 
<EOS>
My
own
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
safe
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
dearest
Charles
,
let
me
thank
God
for
this
on
my
knees
as
I
have
prayed
to
Him
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
all
reverently
bowed
their
heads
and
hearts
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
was
again
in
his
arms
,
he
said
to
her
:
   
"
And
now
speak
to
your
father
,
dearest
.
 
<EOS>
No
other
man
in
all
this
France
could
have
done
what
he
has
done
for
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
laid
her
head
upon
her
father
's
breast
,
as
she
had
laid
his
poor
head
on
her
own
breast
,
long
,
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
happy
in
the
return
he
had
made
her
,
he
was
recompensed
for
his
suffering
,
be
was
proud
of
his
strength
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
be
weak
,
my
darling
,
"
he
remonstrated
;
"
do
n't
tremble
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
saved
him
.
"

<EOS>
A
Knock
at
the
Door
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
saved
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
another
of
the
dreams
in
which
he
had
often
come
back
;
he
was
really
here
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
his
wife
trembled
,
and
a
vague
but
heavy
fear
was
upon
her
.
   
<EOS>
All
the
air
round
was
so
thick
and
dark
,
the
people
were
so
passionately
revengeful
and
fitful
,
the
innocent
were
so
constantly
put
to
death
on
vague
suspicion
and
black
malice
,
it
was
so
impossible
to
forget
that
many
as
blameless
as
her
husband
and
as
dear
to
others
as
he
was
to
her
,
every
day
shared
the
fate
from
which
he
had
been
clutched
,
that
her
heart
could
not
be
as
lightened
of
its
load
as
she
felt
it
ought
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
The
shadows
of
the
wintry
afternoon
were
beginning
to
fall
,
and
even
now
the
dreadful
carts
were
rolling
through
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mind
pursued
them
,
looking
for
him
among
the
Condemned
;
and
then
she
clung
closer
to
his
real
presence
and
trembled
more
.
   
<EOS>
Her
father
,
cheering
her
,
showed
a
compassionate
superiority
to
this
woman
's
weakness
,
which
was
wonderful
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
No
garret
,
no
shoemaking
,
no
One
Hundred
and
Five
,
North
Tower
,
now
!
 
<EOS>
He
had
accomplished
the
task
he
had
set
himself
,
his
promise
was
redeemed
,
he
had
saved
Charles
.
<EOS>
Let
them
all
lean
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
Their
housekeeping
was
of
a
very
frugal
kind
:
 
not
only
because
that
was
the
safest
way
of
life
,
involving
the
least
offence
to
the
people
,
but
because
they
were
not
rich
,
and
Charles
,
throughout
his
imprisonment
,
had
had
to
pay
heavily
for
his
bad
food
,
and
for
his
guard
,
and
towards
the
living
of
the
poorer
prisoners
.
 
<EOS>
Partly
on
this
account
,
and
partly
to
avoid
a
domestic
spy
,
they
kept
no
servant
;
the
citizen
and
citizeness
who
acted
as
porters
at
the
courtyard
gate
,
rendered
them
occasional
service
;
and
Jerry
(
almost
wholly
transferred
to
them
by
Mr
Lorry
)
had
become
their
daily
retainer
,
and
had
his
bed
there
every
night
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
an
ordinance
of
the
Republic
One
and
Indivisible
of
Liberty
,
Equality
,
Fraternity
,
or
Death
,
that
on
the
door
or
doorpost
of
every
house
,
the
name
of
every
inmate
must
be
legibly
inscribed
in
letters
of
a
certain
size
,
at
a
certain
convenient
height
from
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jerry
Cruncher
's
name
,
therefore
,
duly
embellished
the
doorpost
down
below
;
and
,
as
the
afternoon
shadows
deepened
,
the
owner
of
that
name
himself
appeared
,
from
overlooking
a
painter
whom
Doctor
Manette
had
employed
to
add
to
the
list
the
name
of
Charles
Evremonde
,
called
Darnay
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
universal
fear
and
distrust
that
darkened
the
time
,
all
the
usual
harmless
ways
of
life
were
changed
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
Doctor
's
little
household
,
as
in
very
many
others
,
the
articles
of
daily
consumption
that
were
wanted
were
purchased
every
evening
,
in
small
quantities
and
at
various
small
shops
.
 
<EOS>
To
avoid
attracting
notice
,
and
to
give
as
little
occasion
as
possible
for
talk
and
envy
,
was
the
general
desire
.
   
<EOS>
For
some
months
past
,
Miss
Pross
and
Mr
Cruncher
had
discharged
the
office
of
purveyors
;
the
former
carrying
the
money
;
the
latter
,
the
basket
.
 
<EOS>
Every
afternoon
at
about
the
time
when
the
public
lamps
were
lighted
,
they
fared
forth
on
this
duty
,
and
made
and
brought
home
such
purchases
as
were
needful
.
 
<EOS>
Although
Miss
Pross
,
through
her
long
association
with
a
French
family
,
might
have
known
as
much
of
their
language
as
of
her
own
,
if
she
had
had
a
mind
,
she
had
no
mind
in
that
direction
;
consequently
she
knew
no
more
of
that
"
nonsense
"
(
as
she
was
pleased
to
call
it
)
than
Mr
Cruncher
did
.
 
<EOS>
So
her
manner
of
marketing
was
to
plump
a
noun
-
substantive
at
the
head
of
a
shopkeeper
without
any
introduction
in
the
nature
of
an
article
,
and
,
if
it
happened
not
to
be
the
name
of
the
thing
she
wanted
,
to
look
round
for
that
thing
,
lay
hold
of
it
,
and
hold
on
by
it
until
the
bargain
was
concluded
.
 
<EOS>
She
always
made
a
bargain
for
it
,
by
holding
up
,
as
a
statement
of
its
just
price
,
one
finger
less
than
the
merchant
held
up
,
whatever
his
number
might
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr
Cruncher
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
whose
eyes
were
red
with
felicity
;
"
if
you
are
ready
,
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jerry
hoarsely
professed
himself
at
Miss
Pross
's
service
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
worn
all
his
rust
off
long
ago
,
but
nothing
would
file
his
spiky
head
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
all
manner
of
things
wanted
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
"
and
we
shall
have
a
precious
time
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
want
wine
,
among
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Nice
toasts
these
Redheads
will
be
drinking
,
wherever
we
buy
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
much
the
same
to
your
knowledge
,
miss
,
I
should
think
,
"
retorted
Jerry
,
"
whether
they
drink
your
health
or
the
Old
Un
's
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
he
?
"
said
Miss
Pross
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
,
with
some
diffidence
,
explained
himself
as
meaning
"
Old
Nick
's
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
"
it
does
n't
need
an
interpreter
to
explain
the
meaning
of
these
creatures
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
but
one
,
and
it
's
Midnight
Murder
,
and
Mischief
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Hush
,
dear
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
pray
,
be
cautious
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Lucie
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
,
I
'll
be
cautious
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
;
"
but
I
may
say
among
ourselves
,
that
I
do
hope
there
will
be
no
oniony
and
tobaccoey
smotherings
in
the
form
of
embracings
all
round
,
going
on
in
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Ladybird
,
never
you
stir
from
that
fire
till
I
come
back
!
 
<EOS>
Take
care
of
the
dear
husband
you
have
recovered
,
and
do
n't
move
your
pretty
head
from
his
shoulder
as
you
have
it
now
,
till
you
see
me
again
!
 
<EOS>
May
I
ask
a
question
,
Doctor
Manette
,
before
I
go
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
may
take
that
liberty
,
"
the
Doctor
answered
,
smiling
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
gracious
sake
,
do
n't
talk
about
Liberty
;
we
have
quite
enough
of
that
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
dear
!
 
<EOS>
Again
?
<EOS>
"
Lucie
remonstrated
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
sweet
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
nodding
her
head
emphatically
,
"
the
short
and
the
long
of
it
is
,
that
I
am
a
subject
of
His
Most
Gracious
Majesty
King
George
the
Third
;
"
Miss
Pross
curtseyed
at
the
name
;
"
and
as
such
,
my
maxim
is
,
Confound
their
politics
,
Frustrate
their
knavish
tricks
,
<EOS>
On
him
our
hopes
we
fix
,
God
save
the
King
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
,
in
an
access
of
loyalty
,
growlingly
repeated
the
words
after
Miss
Pross
,
Re
somebody
at
church
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
have
so
much
of
the
Englishman
in
you
,
though
I
wish
you
had
never
taken
that
cold
in
your
voice
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
approvingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
the
question
,
Doctor
Manette
.
 
<EOS>
Is
there
"
---
it
was
the
good
creature
's
way
to
affect
to
make
light
of
anything
that
was
a
great
anxiety
with
them
all
,
and
to
come
at
it
in
this
chance
manner
---
"
is
there
any
prospect
yet
,
of
our
getting
out
of
this
place
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
not
yet
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
dangerous
for
Charles
yet
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Heigh
-
ho
-
hum
!
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
cheerfully
repressing
a
sigh
as
she
glanced
at
her
darling
's
golden
hair
in
the
light
of
the
fire
,
"
then
we
must
have
patience
and
wait
:
 
<EOS>
that
's
all
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
hold
up
our
heads
and
fight
low
,
as
my
brother
Solomon
used
to
say
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr
Cruncher
!
---
Do
n't
you
move
,
Ladybird
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
went
out
,
leaving
Lucie
,
and
her
husband
,
her
father
,
and
the
child
,
by
a
bright
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
was
expected
back
presently
from
the
Banking
House
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pross
had
lighted
the
lamp
,
but
had
put
it
aside
in
a
corner
,
that
they
might
enjoy
the
fire
-
light
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
Little
Lucie
sat
by
her
grandfather
with
her
hands
clasped
through
his
arm
:
 
and
he
,
in
a
tone
not
rising
much
above
a
whisper
,
began
to
ten
her
a
story
of
a
great
and
powerful
Fairy
who
had
opened
a
prison
-
wall
and
let
out
a
captive
who
had
once
done
the
Fairy
a
service
.
 
<EOS>
All
was
subdued
and
quiet
,
and
Lucie
was
more
at
ease
than
she
had
been
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
?
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
all
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
!
"
said
her
father
,
stopping
in
his
story
,
and
laying
his
hand
on
hers
,
"
command
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
disordered
state
you
are
in
!
<EOS>
The
least
thing
---
nothing
---
startles
you
!
 
<EOS>
YOU
,
your
father
's
daughter
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
my
father
,
"
said
Lucie
,
excusing
herself
,
with
a
pale
face
and
in
a
faltering
voice
,
"
that
I
heard
strange
feet
upon
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
the
staircase
is
as
still
as
Death
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
said
the
word
,
a
blow
was
struck
upon
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
father
,
father
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
this
be
!
 
<EOS>
Hide
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
Save
him

"
   
<EOS>
"
My
child

said
the
Doctor
,
rising
,
and
laying
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
,
"
I
HAVE
saved
him
.
 
<EOS>
What
weakness
is
this
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
Let
me
go
to
the
door
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
took
the
lamp
in
his
hand
,
crossed
the
two
intervening
outer
rooms
,
and
opened
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
rude
clattering
of
feet
over
the
floor
,
and
four
rough
men
in
red
caps
,
armed
with
sabres
and
pistols
,
entered
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
Citizen
Evremonde

called
Darnay

said
the
first

"
Who
seeks
him

"
answered
Darnay
.
   
<EOS>
"
I

We

the
Tribunal

<EOS>
The
four
surrounded
him
,
where
he
stood
with
his
wife
and
child
clinging
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
how
and
why
am
I
again
a
prisoner
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
enough
that
you
return
straight
to

Conciergerie

You

Doctor
Manette
,
whom
this
visitation
had
so
turned
into
stone
,
that
be
stood
with
the
lamp
in
his
band
,
as
if
be
woe
a
statue
made
to
hold
it

moved
after
these
words
were
spoken
,
put
the
lamp
down
,
and
confronting
the
speaker
,
and
taking
him
,
not
ungently
,
by
the
loose
front
of
his
red
woollen
shirt
,
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
You

We

said
the

He
looked
abstractedly
from
one
to
another
,
and
said
,
in
a
lower
voice
,
after
a
pause
:
   
<EOS>
"
Will

<EOS>
How

"
Citizen

here

nodded
his

added
:

"
Of

asked
the
Doctor

<EOS>
"
Citizen
Doctor

said
the

,
with
his
former
reluctance

the

;

<EOS>
The

turned
his
eyes
upon
that
man

<EOS>
Who
moved
uneasily
on
his
feet

rubbed
his
beard
a
little
,

at
length
said
:

Well

A
Hand
at
Cards
 
Happily
unconscious
of
the
new
calamity
at
home
,
Miss
Pross
threaded
her
way
along
the
narrow
streets
and
crossed
the
river
by
the
bridge
of
the
Pont
-
Neuf
,
reckoning
in
her
mind
the
number
of
indispensable
purchases
she
had
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
,
with
the
basket
,
walked
at
her
side
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
looked
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
into
most
of
the
shops
they
passed
,
had
a
wary
eye
for
all
gregarious
assemblages
of
people
,
and
turned
out
of
their
road
to
avoid
any
very
excited
group
of
talkers
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
raw
evening
,
and
the
misty
river
,
blurred
to
the
eye
with
blazing
lights
and
to
the
ear
with
harsh
noises
,
showed
where
the
barges
were
stationed
in
which
the
smiths
worked
,
making
guns
for
the
Army
of
the
Republic
.
 
<EOS>
Woe
to
the
man
who
played
tricks
with
THAT
Army
,
or
got
undeserved
promotion
in
it
!
 
<EOS>
Better
for
him
that
his
beard
had
never
grown
,
for
the
National
Razor
shaved
him
close
.
   
<EOS>
Having
purchased
a
few
small
articles
of
grocery
,
and
a
measure
of
oil
for
the
lamp
,
Miss
Pross
bethought
herself
of
the
wine
they
wanted
.
<EOS>
After
peeping
into
several
wine
-
shops
,
she
stopped
at
the
sign
of
the
Good
Republican
Brutus
of
Antiquity
,
not
far
from
the
National
Palace
,
once
(
and
twice
)
<EOS>
the
Tuileries
,
where
the
aspect
of
things
rather
took
her
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
a
quieter
look
than
any
other
place
of
the
same
description
they
had
passed
,
and
,
though
red
with
patriotic
caps
,
was
not
so
red
as
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Sounding
Mr
Cruncher
,
and
finding
him
of
her
opinion
,
Miss
Pross
resorted
to
the
Good
Republican
Brutus
of
Antiquity
,
attended
by
her
cavalier
.
   
<EOS>
Slightly
observant
of
the
smoky
lights
;
of
the
people
,
pipe
in
mouth
,
playing
with
limp
cards
and
yellow
dominoes
;
of
the
one
bare
-
breasted
,
bare
-
armed
,
soot
-
begrimed
workman
reading
a
journal
aloud
,
and
of
the
others
listening
to
him
;
of
the
weapons
worn
,
or
laid
aside
to
be
resumed
;
of
the
two
or
three
customers
fallen
forward
asleep
,
who
in
the
popular
high
-
shouldered
shaggy
black
spencer
looked
,
in
that
attitude
,
like
slumbering
bears
or
dogs
;
the
two
outlandish
customers
approached
the
counter
,
and
showed
what
they
wanted
.
   
<EOS>
As
their
wine
was
measuring
out
,
a
man
parted
from
another
man
in
a
corner
,
and
rose
to
depart
.
 
<EOS>
In
going
,
he
had
to
face
Miss
Pross
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
did
he
face
her
,
than
Miss
Pross
uttered
a
scream
,
and
clapped
her
hands
.
   
<EOS>
In
a
moment
,
the
whole
company
were
on
their
feet
.
 
<EOS>
That
somebody
was
assassinated
by
somebody
vindicating
a
difference
of
opinion
<EOS>
was
the
likeliest
occurrence
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
looked
to
see
somebody
fall
,
but
only
saw
a
man
and
a
woman
standing
staring
at
each
other
;
the
man
with
all
the
outward
aspect
of
a
Frenchman
and
a
thorough
Republican
;
the
woman
,
evidently
English
.
   
<EOS>
What
was
said
in
this
disappointing
anti
-
climax
,
by
the
disciples
of
the
Good
Republican
Brutus
of
Antiquity
,
except
that
it
was
something
very
voluble
and
loud
,
would
have
been
as
so
much
Hebrew
or
Chaldean
to
Miss
Pross
and
her
protector
,
though
they
had
been
all
ears
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
they
bad
no
ears
for
anything
in
their
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
it
must
be
recorded
,
that
not
only
was
Miss
Pross
lost
in
amazement
and
agitation
,
but
,
Mr
Cruncher
---
though
it
seemed
on
his
own
separate
and
individual
account
---
was
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
wonder
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
said
the
man
who
had
caused
Miss
Pross
to
scream
;
speaking
in
a
vexed
,
abrupt
voice
(
though
in
a
low
tone
)
,
and
in
English
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Solomon
,
dear
Solomon
!
"
cried
Miss
Pross
,
clapping
her
hands
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
After
not
setting
eyes
upon
you
or
hearing
of
you
for
so
long
a
time
,
do
I
find
you
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
call
me
Solomon
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
want
to
be
the
death
of
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
asked
the
man
,
in
a
furtive
,
frightened
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
Brother
,
brother
!
"
cried
Miss
Pross
,
bursting
into
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
I
ever
been
so
hard
with
you
that
you
ask
me
such
a
cruel
question
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
hold
your
meddlesome
tongue
,
"
said
Solomon
,
"
and
come
out
,
if
you
want
to
speak
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Pay
for
your
wine
,
and
come
out
.
<EOS>
Who
's
this
man
?
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Pross
,
shaking
her
loving
and
dejected
head
at
her
by
no
means
<EOS>
affectionate
brother
,
said
through
her
tears
,
"
Mr
Cruncher
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
him
come
out
too
,
"
said
Solomon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Does
he
think
me
a
ghost
?
"
   
<EOS>
Apparently
,
Mr
Cruncher
did
,
to
judge
from
his
looks
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
not
a
word
,
however
,
and
Miss
Pross
,
exploring
the
depths
of
her
reticule
through
her
tears
with
great
difficulty
paid
for
her
wine
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
did
so
,
Solomon
turned
to
the
followers
of
the
Good
Republican
Brutus
of
Antiquity
,
and
offered
a
few
words
of
explanation
in
the
French
language
,
which
caused
them
all
to
relapse
into
their
former
places
and
pursuits
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Solomon
,
stopping
at
the
dark
street
corner
,
"
what
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
dreadfully
unkind
in
a
brother
nothing
has
ever
turned
my
love
away
from
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miss
Pross
,
"
to
give
me
such
a
greeting
,
and
show
me
no
affection
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
.
 
<EOS>
Confound
it
!
 
<EOS>
There
,
"
said
Solomon
,
making
a
dab
at
Miss
Pross
's
lips
with
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
are
you
content
?
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Pross
only
shook
her
head
and
wept
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
expect
me
to
be
surprised
,
"
said
her
brother
Solomon
,
"
I
am
not
surprised
;
I
knew
you
were
here
;
I
know
of
most
people
who
are
here
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
really
do
n't
want
to
endanger
my
existence
---
which
I
half
believe
you
do
---
go
your
ways
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
let
me
go
mine
.
<EOS>
I
am
busy
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
an
official
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
English
brother
Solomon
,
"
mourned
Miss
Pross
,
casting
up
her
tear
-
fraught
eyes
,
"
<EOS>
that
had
the
makings
in
him
of
one
of
the
best
and
greatest
of
men
in
his
native
country
,
an
official
among
foreigners
,
and
such
foreigners
!
 
<EOS>
I
would
almost
sooner
have
seen
the
dear
boy
lying
in
his
---
"
   
"
I
said
so
!
"
<EOS>
cried
her
brother
,
interrupting
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
want
to
be
the
death
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
rendered
Suspected
,
by
my
own
sister
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
I
am
getting
on
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
gracious
and
merciful
Heavens
forbid
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miss
Pross
.
 
<EOS>
"
Far
rather
would
I
never
see
you
again
,
dear
Solomon
,
though
I
have
ever
loved
you
truly
,
and
ever
shall
.
 
<EOS>
Say
but
one
affectionate
word
to
me
,
and
tell
me
there
is
nothing
angry
or
estranged
between
us
,
and
I
will
detain
you
no
longer
.
"
   
<EOS>
Good
Miss
Pross
!
 
<EOS>
As
if
the
estrangement
between
them
had
come
of
any
culpability
of
hers
.
 
<EOS>
As
if
Mr
Lorry
had
not
known
it
for
a
fact
,
years
ago
,
in
the
quiet
corner
in
Soho
,
that
this
precious
brother
had
spent
her
money
and
left
her
!
   
<EOS>
He
was
saying
the
affectionate
word
,
however
,
with
a
far
more
grudging
condescension
and
patronage
than
he
could
have
shown
if
their
relative
merits
and
positions
had
been
reversed
(
which
is
invariably
the
case
,
all
the
world
over
)
,
when
Mr
Cruncher
,
touching
him
on
the
shoulder
,
hoarsely
and
unexpectedly
interposed
with
the
following
singular
question
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
 
<EOS>
Might
I
ask
the
favour
?
 
<EOS>
As
to
whether
your
name
is
John
Solomon
,
or
Solomon
John
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
official
turned
towards
him
with
sudden
distrust
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
previously
uttered
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
.
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
out
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
Which
,
by
the
way
,
was
more
than
he
could
do
himself
.
)
<EOS>
"
John
Solomon
,
or
Solomon
John
?
 
<EOS>
She
calls
you
Solomon
,
and
she
must
know
,
being
your
sister
.
<EOS>
And
\I\
know
you
're
John
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Which
of
the
two
goes
first
?
<EOS>
And
regarding
that
name
of
Pross
,
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
That
warn't
<EOS>
your
name
over
the
water
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
all
I
mean
,
for
I
ca
n't
call
to
mind
what
your
name
was
,
over
the
water
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
swear
it
was
a
name
of
two
syllables
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Indeed
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
T'other
one
's
was
one
syllable
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
was
a
spy
---
witness
at
the
Bailey
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
in
the
name
of
the
Father
of
Lies
,
own
father
to
yourself
,
was
you
called
at
that
time
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Barsad
,
"
said
another
voice
,
striking
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
name
for
a
thousand
pound
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jerry
.
   
<EOS>
The
speaker
who
struck
in
,
was
Sydney
Carton
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
his
hands
behind
him
under
the
skirts
of
his
riding
-
coat
,
and
he
stood
at
Mr
Cruncher
's
elbow
as
negligently
as
he
might
have
stood
at
the
Old
Bailey
itself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
alarmed
,
my
dear
Miss
Pross
.
 
<EOS>
I
arrived
at
Mr
Lorry
's
,
to
his
surprise
,
yesterday
evening
;
we
agreed
that
I
would
not
present
myself
elsewhere
until
all
was
well
,
or
unless
I
could
be
useful
;
I
present
myself
here
,
to
beg
a
little
talk
with
your
brother
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
had
a
better
employed
brother
than
Mr
Barsad
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
for
your
sake
<EOS>
Mr
Barsad
was
not
a
Sheep
of
the
Prisons
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sheep
was
a
ca
nt
<EOS>
word
of
the
time
for
a
spy
,
under
the
gaolers
.
<EOS>
The
spy
,
who
was
pale
,
turned
paler
,
and
asked
him
how
he
dared
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
,
"
said
Sydney
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
lighted
on
you
,
Mr
Barsad
,
coming
out
of
the
prison
of
the
Conciergerie
while
I
was
contemplating
the
walls
,
an
hour
or
more
ago
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
a
face
to
be
remembered
,
and
I
remember
faces
well
.
 
<EOS>
Made
curious
by
seeing
you
in
that
connection
,
and
having
a
reason
,
to
which
you
are
no
stranger
,
for
associating
you
with
the
misfortunes
of
a
friend
now
very
unfortunate
,
I
walked
in
your
direction
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
into
the
wine
-
shop
here
,
close
after
you
,
and
sat
near
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
difficulty
in
deducing
from
your
unreserved
conversation
,
and
the
rumour
openly
going
about
among
your
admirers
,
the
nature
of
your
calling
.
 
<EOS>
And
gradually
,
what
I
had
done
at
random
,
seemed
to
shape
itself
into
a
purpose
,
Mr
Barsad
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
purpose
?
<EOS>
"
the
spy
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
troublesome
,
and
might
be
dangerous
,
to
explain
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
Could
you
favour
me
,
in
confidence
,
with
some
minutes
of
your
company
---
at
the
office
of
Tellson
's
Bank
,
for
instance
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Under
a
threat
?
"
   
"
Oh
!
 
Did
I
say
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
why
should
I
go
there
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
Mr
Barsad
,
I
ca
n't
say
,
if
you
ca
n't
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
that
you
wo
n't
say
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
the
spy
irresolutely
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
apprehend
me
very
clearly
,
Mr
Barsad
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
.
"
   
<EOS>
Carton
's
negligent
recklessness
of
manner
came
powerfully
in
aid
of
his
quickness
and
skill
,
in
such
a
business
as
be
had
in
his
secret
mind
,
and
with
such
a
man
as
he
had
to
do
with
.
 
<EOS>
His
practised
eye
saw
it
,
and
made
the
most
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
told
you
so
,
"
said
the
spy
,
casting
a
reproachful
look
at
his
sister
;
"
if
any
trouble
comes
of
this
,
it
's
your
doing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
Mr
Barsad
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Sydney
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
But
for
my
great
respect
for
your
sister
,
I
might
not
have
led
up
so
pleasantly
to
a
little
proposal
that
I
wish
to
make
for
our
mutual
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
go
with
me
to
the
Bank
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
hear
what
you
have
got
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
'll
go
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
propose
that
we
first
conduct
your
sister
safely
to
the
corner
of
her
own
street
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
take
your
arm
,
Miss
Pross
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
not
a
good
city
,
at
this
time
,
for
you
to
be
out
in
,
unprotected
;
and
as
your
escort
knows
Mr
Barsad
,
I
will
invite
him
to
Mr
Lorry
's
with
us

<EOS>
Are
we
ready
?
 
<EOS>
Come
then
!
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Pross
recalled
soon
afterwards
,
and
to
the
end
of
her
life
remembered
,
that
as
she
pressed
her
hands
on
Sydney
's
arm
and
looked
up
in
his
face
,
imploring
him
to
do
no
hurt
to
Solomon
,
there
was
a
braced
purpose
in
the
arm
and
a
kind
of
inspiration
in
the
eyes
,
which
not
only
contradicted
his
light
manner
,
but
changed
and
raised
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
too
much
occupied
then
with
fears
for
the
brother
who
so
little
deserved
her
affection
,
and
with
Sydney
's
friendly
reassurances
,
adequately
to
heed
what
she
observed
.
   
<EOS>
They
left
her
at
the
corner
of
the
street
,
and
Carton
led
the
way
to
Mr
Lorry
's
,
which
was
within
a
few
minutes
'
walk
.
 
<EOS>
John
Barsad
,
or
Solomon
Pross
,
walked
at
his
side
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
had
just
finished
his
dinner
,
and
was
sitting
before
a
cheery
little
log
or
two
of
fire
---
perhaps
looking
into
their
blaze
for
the
picture
of
that
younger
elderly
gentleman
from
Tellson
's
,
who
had
looked
into
the
red
coals
at
the
Royal
George
at
Dover
,
now
a
good
many
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
his
head
as
they
entered
,
and
showed
the
surprise
with
which
he
saw
a
stranger
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Miss
Pross
's
brother
,
sir
,
"
said
Sydney
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Barsad
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Barsad
?
"
repeated
the
old
gentleman
,
"
Barsad
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
an
association
with
the
name
---
<EOS>
and
with
the
face
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
you
had
a
remarkable
face
,
Mr
Barsad
,
"
observed
Carton
,
coolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
sit
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
took
a
chair
himself
,
he
supplied
the
link
that
Mr
Lorry
wanted
,
by
saying
to
him
with
a
frown
,
"
Witness
at
that
trial
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
immediately
remembered
,
and
regarded
his
new
visitor
with
an
undisguised
look
of
abhorrence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Barsad
has
been
recognised
by
Miss
Pross
as
the
affectionate
brother
you
have
heard
of
,
"
said
Sydney
,
"
and
has
acknowledged
the
relationship
.
 
<EOS>
I
pass
to
worse
news
.
 
<EOS>
Darnay
has
been
arrested
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
Struck
with
consternation
,
the
old
gentleman
exclaimed
,
"
What
do
you
tell
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
left
him
safe
and
free
within
these
two
hours
,
and
am
about
to
return
to
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Arrested
for
all
that
.
 
<EOS>
When
was
it
done
,
Mr
Barsad
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
now
,
if
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Mr
Barsad
is
the
best
authority
possible
,
sir
,
"
said
Sydney
,
"
and
I
have
it
from
Mr
Barsad
's
communication
to
a
friend
and
brother
Sheep
over
a
bottle
of
wine
,
that
the
arrest
has
taken
place
.
 
<EOS>
He
left
the
messengers
at
the
gate
,
and
saw
them
admitted
by
the
porter
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
earthly
doubt
that
he
is
retaken
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
's
business
eye
read
in
the
speaker
's
face
that
it
was
loss
of
time
to
dwell
upon
the
point
.
 
<EOS>
Confused
,
but
sensible
that
something
might
depend
on
his
presence
of
mind
,
he
commanded
himself
,
and
was
silently
attentive
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
trust
,
"
said
Sydney
to
him
,
"
that
the
name
and
influence
of
Doctor
Manette
may
stand
him
in
as
good
stead
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
---
you
said
he
would
be
before
the
Tribunal
again
to
-
morrow
,
Mr
Barsad
?
---
"
   
"
Yes
;
I
believe
so
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
---
In
as
good
stead
to
-
morrow
as
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
may
not
be
so
.
<EOS>
I
own
to
you
,
I
am
shaken
,
Mr
Lorry
,
by
Doctor
Manette
's
not
having
had
the
power
to
prevent
this
arrest
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
may
not
have
known
of
it
beforehand
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
that
very
circumstance
would
be
alarming
,
when
we
remember
how
identified
he
is
with
his
son
-
in
-
law
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
"
Mr
Lorry
acknowledged
,
with
his
troubled
hand
at
his
chin
,
and
his
troubled
eyes
on
Carton
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
"
said
Sydney
,
"
this
is
a
desperate
time
,
when
desperate
games
are
played
for
desperate
stakes
.
 
<EOS>
Let
the
Doctor
play
the
winning
game
;
I
will
play
the
losing
one
.
 
<EOS>
No
man
's
life
here
is
worth
purchase
.
<EOS>
Any
one
carried
home
by
the
people
to
-
day
,
may
be
condemned
tomorrow
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
the
stake
I
have
resolved
to
play
for
,
in
case
of
the
worst
,
is
a
friend
in
the
Conciergerie
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
friend
I
purpose
to
myself
to
win
,
is
Mr
Barsad
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
need
have
good
cards
,
sir
,
"
said
the
spy
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
run
them
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
see
what
I
hold
,
---
Mr
Lorry
,
you
know
what
a
brute
<EOS>
I
am
;
I
wish
you
'd
give
me
a
little
brandy
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
put
before
him
,
and
he
drank
off
a
glassful
---
drank
off
another
glassful
---
pushed
the
bottle
thoughtfully
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Barsad
,
"
he
went
on
,
in
the
tone
of
one
who
really
was
looking
over
a
hand
at
cards
:
 
"
Sheep
of
the
prisons
,
emissary
of
Republican
committees
,
now
turnkey
,
now
prisoner
,
always
spy
and
secret
informer
,
so
much
the
more
valuable
here
for
being
English
that
an
Englishman
is
less
open
to
suspicion
of
subornation
in
those
characters
than
a
Frenchman
,
represents
himself
to
his
employers
under
a
false
name
.
<EOS>
That
's
a
very
good
card
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Barsad
,
now
in
the
employ
of
the
republican
French
government
,
was
formerly
in
the
employ
of
the
aristocratic
English
government
,
the
enemy
of
France
and
freedom
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
an
excellent
card
.
 
<EOS>
Inference
clear
as
day
in
this
region
of
suspicion
,
that
Mr
Barsad
,
still
in
the
pay
of
the
aristocratic
English
government
,
is
the
spy
of
Pitt
,
the
treacherous
foe
of
the
Republic
crouching
in
its
bosom
,
the
English
traitor
and
agent
of
all
mischief
so
much
spoken
of
and
so
difficult
to
find
.
<EOS>
That
's
a
card
not
to
be
beaten
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
followed
my
hand
,
Mr
Barsad
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
to
understand
your
play
,
"
returned
the
spy
,
somewhat
uneasily
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
play
my
Ace
,
Denunciation
of
Mr
Barsad
to
the
nearest
Section
Committee
.
 
<EOS>
Look
over
your
hand
,
Mr
Barsad
,
and
see
what
you
have
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
hurry
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
drew
the
bottle
near
,
poured
out
another
glassful
of
brandy
,
and
drank
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
that
the
spy
was
fearful
of
his
drinking
himself
into
a
fit
state
for
the
immediate
denunciation
of
him
.
<EOS>
Seeing
it
,
he
poured
out
and
drank
another
glassful
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
over
your
hand
carefully
,
Mr
Barsad
.
 
<EOS>
Take
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
poorer
hand
than
he
suspected
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Barsad
saw
losing
cards
in
it
that
Sydney
Carton
knew
nothing
of
.
 
<EOS>
Thrown
out
of
his
honourable
employment
in
England
,
through
too
much
unsuccessful
hard
swearing
there
---
not
because
he
was
not
wanted
there
<EOS>
;
our
English
reasons
for
vaunting
our
superiority
to
secrecy
and
spies
are
of
very
modern
date
---
he
knew
that
he
had
crossed
the
Channel
,
and
accepted
service
in
France
:
 
first
,
as
a
tempter
and
an
eavesdropper
among
his
own
countrymen
there
:
 
gradually
,
as
a
tempter
and
an
eavesdropper
among
the
natives
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
that
under
the
overthrown
government
he
had
been
a
spy
upon
Saint
Antoine
and
Defarge
's
wine
-
shop
;
had
received
from
the
watchful
police
such
heads
of
information
concerning
Doctor
Manette
's
imprisonment
,
release
,
and
history
,
as
should
serve
him
for
an
introduction
to
familiar
conversation
with
the
Defarges
;
and
tried
them
on
Madame
Defarge
,
and
had
broken
down
with
them
signally
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
remembered
with
fear
and
trembling
,
that
that
terrible
woman
had
knitted
when
he
talked
with
her
,
and
had
looked
ominously
at
him
as
her
fingers
moved
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
since
seen
her
,
in
the
Section
of
Saint
Antoine
,
over
and
over
again
produce
her
knitted
registers
,
and
denounce
people
whose
lives
the
guillotine
then
surely
swallowed
up
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
,
as
every
one
employed
as
he
was
did
,
that
he
was
never
safe
;
that
flight
was
impossible
;
that
he
was
tied
fast
under
the
shadow
of
the
axe
;
and
that
in
spite
of
his
utmost
tergiversation
and
treachery
in
furtherance
of
the
reigning
terror
,
a
word
might
bring
it
down
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
Once
denounced
,
and
on
such
grave
grounds
as
had
just
now
been
suggested
to
his
mind
,
he
foresaw
that
the
dreadful
woman
of
whose
unrelenting
character
he
had
seen
many
proofs
,
would
produce
against
him
that
fatal
register
,
and
would
quash
his
last
chance
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
that
all
secret
men
are
men
soon
terrified
,
here
were
surely
cards
enough
of
one
black
suit
,
to
justify
the
holder
in
growing
rather
livid
as
he
turned
them
over
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
scarcely
seem
to
like
your
hand
,
"
said
Sydney
,
with
the
greatest
composure
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
play
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
sir
,
"
said
the
spy
,
in
the
meanest
manner
,
as
he
turned
to
Mr
Lorry
,
"
I
may
appeal
to
a
gentleman
of
your
years
and
benevolence
,
to
put
it
to
this
other
gentleman
,
so
much
your
junior
,
whether
he
can
under
any
circumstances
reconcile
it
to
his
station
to
play
that
Ace
of
which
he
has
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
I
admit
that
\I\
am
a
spy
,
and
that
it
is
considered
a
discreditable
station
---
though
it
must
be
filled
by
somebody
;
but
this
gentleman
is
no
spy
,
and
why
should
he
so
demean
himself
as
to
make
himself
one
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
play
my
Ace
,
Mr
Barsad
,
"
said
Carton
,
taking
the
answer
on
himself
,
and
looking
at
his
watch
,
"
without
any
scruple
,
in
a
very
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
hoped
,
gentlemen
both
,
"
said
the
spy
,
always
striving
to
hook
Mr
Lorry
into
the
discussion
,
"
that
your
respect
for
my
sister
---
"
   
"
I
could
not
better
testify
my
respect
for
your
sister
than
by
finally
relieving
her
of
her
brother
,
"
said
Sydney
Carton
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
think
not
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
thoroughly
made
up
my
mind
about
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
smooth
manner
of
the
spy
,
curiously
in
dissonance
with
his
ostentatiously
rough
dress
,
and
probably
with
his
usual
demeanour
,
received
such
a
check
from
the
inscrutability
of
Carton
,
---
who
was
a
mystery
to
wiser
and
honester
men
than
he
,
---
that
it
faltered
here
and
failed
him
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
at
a
loss
,
Carton
said
,
resuming
his
former
air
of
contemplating
cards
:
   
"
And
indeed
,
now
I
think
again
,
I
have
a
strong
impression
that
I
have
another
good
card
here
,
not
yet
enumerated
.
 
<EOS>
That
friend
and
fellow
-
Sheep
,
who
spoke
of
himself
as
pasturing
in
the
country
prisons
;
who
was
he
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
French
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
him
,
"
said
the
spy
,
quickly
.
   
<EOS>
"
French
,
eh
?
"
repeated
Carton
,
musing
,
and
not
appearing
to
notice
him
at
all
,
though
he
echoed
his
word
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
;
he
may
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
,
I
assure
you
,
"
said
the
spy
;
"
though
it
's
not
important
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Though
it
's
not
important
,
"
repeated
Carton
,
in
the
same
mechanical
way
---
"
though
it
's
not
important
---
No
,
it
's
not
important
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
know
the
face
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
not
.
 
<EOS>
It
ca
n't
be
,
"
said
the
spy
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
-
can't
-
be
,
"
muttered
Sydney
Carton
,
retrospectively
,
and
idling
his
glass
(
which
fortunately
was
a
small
one
)
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can't
-
be
.
<EOS>
Spoke
good
French
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
like
a
foreigner
,
I
thought
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Provincial
,
"
said
the
spy
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
Foreign
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Carton
,
striking
his
open
hand
on
the
table
,
as
a
light
broke
clearly
on
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
"
Cly
!
 
<EOS>
Disguised
,
but
the
same
man
.
<EOS>
We
had
that
man
before
us
at
the
Old
Bailey
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
there
you
are
hasty
,
sir
,
"
said
Barsad
,
with
a
smile
that
gave
his
aquiline
nose
an
extra
inclination
to
one
side
;
"
there
you
really
give
me
an
advantage
over
you
.
 
<EOS>
Cly
(
who
I
will
unreservedly
admit
,
at
this
distance
of
time
,
was
a
partner
of
mine
)
has
been
dead
several
years
.
 
<EOS>
I
attended
him
in
his
last
illness
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
buried
in
London
,
at
the
church
of
Saint
Pancras
-
in
-
the
-
Fields
.
 
<EOS>
His
unpopularity
with
the
blackguard
<EOS>
multitude
at
the
moment
prevented
my
following
his
remains
,
but
I
helped
to
lay
him
in
his
coffin
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
,
Mr
Lorry
became
aware
,
from
where
he
sat
,
of
a
most
remarkable
goblin
shadow
on
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
Tracing
it
to
its
source
,
he
discovered
it
to
be
caused
by
a
sudden
extraordinary
rising
and
stiffening
of
all
the
risen
and
stiff
hair
on
Mr
Cruncher
's
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
us
be
reasonable
,
"
said
the
spy
,
"
and
let
us
be

To
show
you
how
mistaken
you
are
,
and
<EOS>
what
an
unfounded
assumption
yours
is
,
I
will
lay
before
you
a
certificate
of
Cly
's
burial
,
which
I
happened
to
have
carried
in
my
pocket
-
book

"
with
a
hurried
hand
he
produced

opened
it
,

ever

There
it

<EOS>
Oh

look
at

look

You
may
take
it
in
your
hand

it
's
no

"
   
<EOS>
Here
,
Mr
Lorry
perceived
the
reflection
on
the
wall
to
elongate
,
and
Mr
Cruncher
rose
and
stepped
forward
.
 
<EOS>
His
hair
could
not
have
been
more
violently
on
end
,
if
it
had
been
that
moment
dressed
by
the
Cow
with
the
crumpled
horn
in
the
house
that
Jack
built
.
   
<EOS>
Unseen
by
the
spy
,
Mr
Cruncher
stood
at
his
side
,
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
like
a
ghostly
bailiff
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
there
Roger
Cly
,
master
,
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
,
with
a
taciturn
and
iron
-
bound
visage
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
YOU
put
him
in
his
coffin
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
took
him
out
of
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
Barsad
leaned
back
in
his
chair
,
and
stammered
,
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
,
"
that
he
warn't
<EOS>
never
in

<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
Not
he
!
<EOS>
I
'll
have
my
head
took
off
,
if
he
was
ever
in
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
spy
looked
round
at
the
two
gentlemen
;
they
both
looked
in
unspeakable
astonishment
at
Jerry
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
"
said
Jerry
,
"
that
you
buried
paving
-
stones
and
earth
in
that
there
coffin
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
go
and
tell
me
that
you
buried
Cly

<EOS>
It
was
a
take
in

<EOS>
Me

How

"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
to

<EOS>
Ecod

"
growled
Mr
Cruncher
,
"
it
's
you
<EOS>
I
have
got
a
old
grudge
again
<EOS>
,
is
it

Sydney
Carton
,
who
,
with
Mr
Lorry
,
had
been
lost
in
amazement
at
this
turn
of
the
business
,
here
requested
Mr
Cruncher
to
moderate
and
explain
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
another
time
,
sir
,
"
he
returned
,
evasively
,
"
the

time
is
ill

conwenient

<EOS>
What
I
stand
to
,
is
,
that
he
knows
well
wot
that
there
<EOS>
Cly
was
never
in
that
there
coffin
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
say
he
was

in
so
much
as
a
word
of
one
syllable
,
and
I
'll
either
catch
hold
of
his
throat
and
choke
him
for
half
a
guinea

"
Mr
Cruncher
dwelt
upon
this
as
quite
a
liberal
offer
;
"
or
I
'll
out
and
announce
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
one
thing
,
"
said
Carton
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hold
another
card
,
Mr

<EOS>
Impossible

raging
Paris

with

filling
the
air
,
for
you
to
outlive
denunciation
,
when
you
are
in
communication
with
another
aristocratic
spy
of
the
same
antecedents

yourself
,
who
,
moreover
,
has
the
mystery
about
him
of
having
feigned
death
and
come
to
life
again
!
 
<EOS>
A
plot
in
the
prisons
,
of
the
foreigner
against
the
Republic
.
<EOS>
A
strong
card

a
certain
Guillotine
card

<EOS>
Do
you
play

<EOS>
"
No

"
returned
the
spy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
throw
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
that
we
were
so
unpopular
with
the
outrageous
mob
,
that
I
only
got
away
from
England
at
the
risk
of
being
ducked
to
death
,
and
that
Cly
was
so
ferreted
up
and
down
,
that
he
never
would
have
got
away
at
all

for
that
sham

<EOS>
Though
how
this

is
a

wonders

<EOS>
"
Never
you
trouble
your
head
about
this
man

retorted
the
contentious
Mr

;
"
you
'll
have
trouble
enough
with
giving
your
attention
to

And
look
here

<EOS>
Once
more

<EOS>
---
Mr
Cruncher
could
not
be
restrained
from
making
rather
an
ostentatious
parade
of
his
liberality
---
"
I
'd
catch
hold
of
your
throat

choke
you
for
half

"
   
<EOS>
The
Sheep
of
the
prisons
turned
from
him
to
Sydney
Carton
,
and
said
,
with
more
decision
,
"
It
has
come

a
point

on
duty
soon

You
told

you
had
a
proposal

what
is
it
?
<EOS>
Now
,
it
is
of
no
use
asking
too
much
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
Ask
me
to
do
anything
in
my
office
,
putting
my
head
in
great
extra
danger
,
and
I
had
better
trust
my
life
to
the
chances
of
a
refusal
than
the
chances
of
consent
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
should
make
that
choice

<EOS>
You
talk
of
desperation

<EOS>
We
are
all
desperate

!

I
may
denounce
you

my

Now

Not

firmly

Why

Sydney
Carton
filled
another
glass
with
brandy
,
poured
it
slowly
out
upon
the
hearth
,
and
watched
it
as
it
dropped
.
 
<EOS>
It
being
all
spent
,
he
said
,
rising
:
   
"
<EOS>
So
far

we
have
spoken

<EOS>
The
Game
Made
 
<EOS>
While
Sydney
Carton
and
the
Sheep
of
the
prisons
were
in
the
adjoining
dark
room
,
speaking
so
low
that
not
a
sound
was
heard
,
Mr
Lorry
looked
at
Jerry
in
considerable
doubt
and
mistrust
.
 
<EOS>
That
honest
tradesman
's
manner
of
receiving
the
look
,
did
not
inspire
confidence
;
he
changed
the
leg
on
which
he
rested
,
as
often
as
if
he
had
fifty
of
those
limbs
,
and
were
trying
them
all
;
he
examined
his
finger
-
nails
with
a
very
questionable
closeness
of
attention
;
and
whenever
Mr
Lorry
's
eye
caught
his
,
he
was
taken
with
that
peculiar
kind
of
short
cough
requiring
the
hollow
of
a
hand
before
it
,
which
is
seldom
,
if
ever
,
known
to
be
an
infirmity
attendant
on
perfect
openness
of
character
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jerry
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
came
forward
sideways
,
with
one
of
his
shoulders
in
advance
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
been
,
besides
a
messenger
?
"
   
<EOS>
After
some
cogitation
,
accompanied
with
an
intent
look
at
his
patron
,
Mr
Cruncher
conceived
the
luminous
idea
of
replying
,
"
Agicultooral
character
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
mind
misgives
me
much
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
angrily
shaking
a
forefinger
at
him
,
"
that
you
have
used
the
respectable
and
great
house
of
Tellson
's
as
a
blind
,
and
that
you
have
had
an
unlawful
occupation
of
an
infamous
description
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
,
do
n't
expect
me
to
befriend
you
when
you
get
back
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
,
do
n't
expect
me
to
keep
your
secret

<EOS>
Tellson
's
shall
not
be
imposed
upon
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
sir
,
"
pleaded
the
abashed
Mr
Cruncher
,
"
that
a
gentleman
like
yourself
wot
I
've
had
the
honour
of
odd
jobbing
till
I
'm
grey
at

would
think
twice
about
harming

do
n't
say
it
is

into

it
would

even
then
,
be
all
o

one
side

<EOS>
There
'd
be
two
sides
to
it

<EOS>
There
might
be
medical
doctors
at
the
present
hour
,
a
picking
up
their
guineas
where
a
honest
tradesman
do
n't
pick
up

fardens

<EOS>
no
,
nor
yet
his
half
fardens
---
half
fardens
!
<EOS>
no
,
nor
yet
his
quarter

a
banking
away
like
smoke
at
Tellson
's
,
and
a
cocking
their
medical
eyes
at
that
tradesman
on
the
sly
<EOS>
,
a
going
in
and
going
out
to
their
own
carriages
---
ah

<EOS>
equally
like
smoke

if
not
more
so
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
that

be
imposing

too

on
Tellson

<EOS>
For
you
can
not
sarse

And
here
's
Mrs
Cruncher
,
or

Old

times

Whereas

catch

<EOS>
Or
,
if

flop

their
toppings
goes
in
favour
of
more
patients

how
can
you
rightly
have
one
without

Then
,
wot
with
undertakers

and
wot

parish
clerks

wot
with
sextons

with
private

And
wot
little
a

did
get

would
never

Mr

<EOS>
He
'd
never

That

said
Mr

,
wiping
his
forehead
with
his

,
as
an
announcement
that
he
had
arrived
at
the
peroration

Mr
Cruncher
knuckled
his
forehead
,
as
Sydney
Carton
and
the
spy
returned
from
the
dark
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
Adieu

He
sat
down

chair
on
the
hearth
,
over
against
Mr

<EOS>
When
they
were
alone

Mr

asked
him
what
he
had
done
?
   
<EOS>
"
Not
much
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
should
go
ill
with
the
prisoner
,
I
have
ensured
access
to
him
,
once
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
's
countenance
fell
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
I
could
do
,
"
said
Carton
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
propose
too
much
,
would
be
to
put
this
man
's
head
under
the
axe
,
and
,
as
he
himself
said
,
nothing
worse
could
happen
to
him
if
he
were
denounced
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
obviously
the
weakness
of
the
position
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
help
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
access
to
him
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
"
if
it
should
go
ill
before
the
Tribunal
,
will
not
save
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
said
it
would
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
's
eyes
gradually
sought
the
fire
;
his
sympathy
with
his
darling
,
and
the
heavy
disappointment
of
his
second
arrest
,
gradually
weakened
them
;
he
was
an
old
man
now
,
overborne
with
anxiety
of
late
,
and
his
tears
fell
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
good
man
and
a
true
friend
,
"
said
Carton
,
in
an
altered
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Forgive
me
if
I
notice
that
you
are
affected
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
my
father
weep
,
and
sit
by
,
careless
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
could
not
respect
your
sorrow
more
,
if
you
were
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
free
from
that
misfortune
,
however
.
"
   
<EOS>
Though
he
said
the
last
words
,
with
a
slip
into
his
usual
manner
,
there
was
a
true
feeling
and
respect
both
in
his
tone
and
in
his
touch
,
that
Mr
Lorry
,
who
had
never
seen
the
better
side
of
him
,
was
wholly
unprepared
for
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
him
his
band
,
and
Carton
gently
pressed
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
return
to
poor
Darnay
,
"
said
Carton
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
tell
Her
of
this
interview
,
or
this
arrangement
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
not
enable
Her
to
go
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
She
might
think
it
was
contrived
,
in
case
of
the
worse
,
to
convey
to
him
the
means
of
anticipating
the
sentence
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
had
not
thought
of
that
,
and
he
looked
quickly
at
Carton
to
see
if
it
were
in
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
be
;
he
returned
the
look
,
and
evidently
understood
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
might
think
a
thousand
things
,
"
Carton
said
,
"
and
any
of
them
would
only
add
to
her
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
speak
of
me
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
said
to
you
when
I
first
came
,
I
had
better
not
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
put
my
hand
out
,
to
do
any
little
helpful
work
for
her
that
my
hand
can
find
to
do
,
without
that
.
<EOS>
You
are
going
to
her
,
I
hope
?
 
<EOS>
She
must
be
very
desolate
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
now
,
directly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
such
a
strong
attachment
to
you
and
reliance
on
you
.
 
<EOS>
How
does
she
look
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Anxious
and
unhappy
,
but
very
beautiful
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
,
grieving
sound
,
like
a
sigh
---
almost
like
a
sob
.
 
<EOS>
It
attracted
Mr
Lorry
's
eyes
to
Carton
's
face
,
which
was
turned
to
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
A
light
,
or
a
shade
(
the
old
gentleman
could
not
have
said
which
)
,
passed
from
it
as
swiftly
as
a
change
will
sweep
over
a
hill
-
side
on
a
wild
bright
day
,
and
he
lifted
his
foot
to
put
back
one
of
the
little
flaming
logs
,
which
was
tumbling
forward
.
 
<EOS>
He
wore
the
white
riding
-
coat
and
top
-
boots
,
then
in
vogue
,
and
the
light
of
the
fire
touching
their
light
surfaces
made
him
look
very
pale
,
with
his
long
brown
hair
,
all
untrimmed
,
hanging
loose
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
indifference
to
fire
was
sufficiently
remarkable
to
elicit
a
word
of
remonstrance
from
Mr
Lorry
;
his
boot
was
still
upon
the
hot
embers
of
the
flaming
log
,
when
it
had
broken
under
the
weight
of
Ms
foot
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
forgot
it
,
"
he
said
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
's
eyes
were
again
attracted
to
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
Taking
note
of
the
wasted
air
which
clouded
the
naturally
handsome
features
,
and
having
the
expression
of
prisoners
'
faces
fresh
in
his
mind
,
he
was
strongly
reminded
of
that
expression
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
your
duties
here
have
drawn
to
an
end
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
said
Carton
,
turning
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
was
telling
you
last
night
when
Lucie
came
in
so
unexpectedly
<EOS>
,
I
have
at
length
done
all
that
I
can
do
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
hoped
to
have
left
them
in
perfect
safety
,
and
then
to
have
quitted
Paris
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
Leave
to
Pass
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
ready
to
go
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
were
both
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yours
is
a
long
life
to
look
back
upon
,
sir
?
"
said
Carton
,
wistfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
in
my
seventy
-
eighth
year
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
useful
all
your
life
;
steadily
and
constantly
occupied
;
trusted
,
respected
,
and
looked
up
to
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
a
man
of
business
,
ever
since
I
have
been
a
man
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
may
say
that
I
was
a
man
of
business
when
a
boy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
See
what
a
place
you
fill
at
seventy
-
eight
.
 
<EOS>
How
many
people
will
miss
you
when
you
leave
it
empty
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
solitary
old
bachelor
,
"
answered
Mr
Lorry
,
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
nobody
to
weep
for
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
say
that
?
 
<EOS>
Would
n't
She
weep
for
you
?
 
<EOS>
Would
n't
her
child
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
thank
God
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
quite
mean
what
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
IS
a
thing
to
thank
God
for
;
is
it
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
surely
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
could
say
,
with
truth
,
to
your
own
solitary
heart
,
to
-
night
,
"
I
have
secured
to
myself
the
love
and
attachment
,
the
gratitude
or
respect
,
of
no
human
creature
;
I
have
won
myself
a
tender
place
in
no
regard
;
I
have
done
nothing
good
or
serviceable
to
be
remembered
by
!
"
<EOS>
your
seventy
-
eight
years
would
be
seventy
-
eight
heavy
curses
;
would
they
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
say
truly
,
Mr
Carton
;
I
think
they
would
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sydney
turned
his
eyes
again
upon
the
fire
,
and
,
after
a
silence
of
a
few
moments
,
said
:
   
"
I
should
like
to
ask
you
:
---
Does
your
childhood
seem
far
off
?
 
<EOS>
Do
the
days
when
you
sat
at
your
mother
's
knee
,
seem
days
of
very
long
ago
?
"
   
<EOS>
Responding
to
his
softened
manner
,
Mr
Lorry
answered
:
   
"
Twenty
years
back
,
yes
;
at
this
time
of
my
life
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
as
I
draw
closer
and
closer
to
the
end
,
I
travel
in
the
circle
,
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
beginning
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
to
be
one
of
the
kind
smoothings
and
preparings
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
is
touched
now
,
by
many
remembrances
that
had
long
fallen
asleep
,
of
my
pretty
young
mother
<EOS>
(
and
I
so
old
!
)
,
and
by
many
associations
of
the
days
when
what
we
call
the
World
was
not
so
real
with
me
,
and
my
faults
were
not
confirmed
in
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
understand
the
feeling
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Carton
,
with
a
bright
flush
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
are
the
better
for
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
Carton
terminated
the
conversation
here
,
by
rising
to
help
him
on
with
his
outer
coat
;
"
But
you
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
reverting
to
the
theme
,
"
you
are
young
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Carton
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
old
,
but
my
young
way
was
never
the
way
to
age
.
 
<EOS>
Enough
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
of
me
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
out
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
walk
with
you
to
her
gate
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
my
vagabond
and
restless
habits
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
should
prowl
about
the
streets
a
long
time
,
do
n't
be
uneasy
;
I
shall
reappear
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
You
go
to
the
Court
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
unhappily
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
there
,
but
only
as
one
of
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
My
Spy
will
find
a
place
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Take
my
arm
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
did
so
,
and
they
went
down
-
stairs
and
out
in
the
streets
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
brought
them
to
Mr
Lorry
's
destination
.
 
<EOS>
Carton
left
him
there
;
but
lingered
at
a
little
distance
,
and
turned
back
to
the
gate
again
when
it
was
shut
,
and
touched
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
heard
of
her
going
to
the
prison
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
came
out
here
,
"
he
said
,
looking
about
him
,
"
turned
this
way
,
must
have
trod
on
these
stones
often
.
<EOS>
Let
me
follow
in
her
steps
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
ten
o'clock
at
night
when
he
stood
before
the
prison
of
La
Force
,
where
she
had
stood
hundreds
of
times
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
wood
-
sawyer
,
having
closed
his
shop
,
was
smoking
his
pipe
at
his
shop
-
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
citizen
,
"
said
Sydney
Carton
,
pausing
in
going
by
;
for
,
the
man
eyed
him
inquisitively
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
citizen
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
goes
the
Republic
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
mean
the
Guillotine
.
 
<EOS>
Not
ill
.
 
<EOS>
Sixty
-
three
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
mount
to
a
hundred
soon
.
 
<EOS>
Samson
and
his
men
complain
sometimes
,
of
being
exhausted
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
He
is
so
droll
,
that
Samson
.
<EOS>
Such
a
Barber
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
often
go
to
see
him
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
Shave
?
 
<EOS>
Always
.
 
<EOS>
Every
day
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
barber
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
seen
him
at
work
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Go
and
see
him
when
he
has
a
good
batch
.
 
<EOS>
Figure
this
to
yourself
,
citizen
<EOS>
;
he
shaved
the
sixty
-
three
to
-
day
,
in
less
than
two
pipes
!
<EOS>
Less
than
two
pipes
.
 
<EOS>
Word
of
honour
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
grinning
little
man
held
out
the
pipe
he
was
smoking
,
to
explain
how
he
timed
the
executioner
,
Carton
was
so
sensible
of
a
rising
desire
to
strike
the
life
out
of
him
,
that
he
turned
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
not
English
,
"
said
the
wood
-
sawyer
,
"
though
you
wear
English
dress
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Carton
,
pausing
again
,
and
answering
over
his
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
speak
like
a
Frenchman
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
an
old
student
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aha
,
a
perfect
Frenchman
!
 
<EOS>
Good
night
,
Englishman
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
citizen
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
go
and
see
that
droll
dog
,
"
the
little
man
persisted
,
calling
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
take
a
pipe
with
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
Sydney
had
not
gone
far
out
of
sight
,
when
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
street
under
a
glimmering
lamp
,
and
wrote
with
his
pencil
on
a
scrap
of
paper
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
traversing
with
the
decided
step
of
one
who
remembered
the
way
well
,
several
dark
and
dirty
streets
---
much
dirtier
than
usual
,
for
the
best
public
thoroughfares
remained
uncleansed
in
those
times
of
terror
<EOS>
---
he
stopped
at
a
chemist
's
shop
,
which
the
owner
was
closing
with
his
own
hands
.
 
<EOS>
A
small
,
dim
,
crooked
shop
,
kept
in
a
tortuous
,
up
-
hill
thoroughfare
,
by
a
small
,
dim
,
crooked
man
.
   
<EOS>
Giving
this
citizen
,
too
,
good
night
,
as
he
confronted
him
at
his
counter
,
he
laid
the
scrap
of
paper
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whew
!
"
<EOS>
the
chemist
whistled
softly
,
as
he
read
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hi
!
<EOS>
hi
!
<EOS>
hi
!
"
   
<EOS>
Sydney
Carton
took
no
heed
,
and
the
chemist
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
For
you
,
citizen
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
careful
to
keep
them
separate
,
citizen
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
the
consequences
of
mixing
them
?
"
   
"
<EOS>
Perfectly
.
"
   
<EOS>
Certain
small
packets
were
made
and
given
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
them
,
one
by
one
,
in
the
breast
of
his
inner
coat
,
counted
out
the
money
for
them
,
and
deliberately
left
the
shop
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
more
to
do
,
"
said
he
,
glancing
upward
at
the
moon
,
"
until
to

morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
sleep

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
reckless
manner
,
the
manner
in
which
he
said
these
words
aloud
under
the
fast
-
sailing
clouds
,
nor
was
it
more
expressive
of
negligence
than
defiance
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
settled
manner
of
a
tired
man
,
who
had
wandered
and
struggled
and
got
lost
,
but
who
at
length
struck
into
his
road
and
saw
its
end
.
   
<EOS>
Long
ago
,
when
he
had
been
famous
among
his
earliest
competitors
as
a
youth
of
great
promise
,
be
had
followed
his
father
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
His
mother
had
died
,
years
before
.
 
<EOS>
These
solemn
words
,
which
had
been
read
at
his
father
's
grave
,
arose
in
his
mind
as
he
went
down
the
dark
streets
,
among
the
heavy
shadows
,
with
the
moon
and
the
clouds
sailing
on
high
above
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life

saith
the
Lord

he

"
   
<EOS>
In
a
city
dominated
by
the
axe
,
alone
at
night
,
with
natural
sorrow
rising
in
him
for
the
sixty
-
three
who
had
been
that
day
put
to
death
,
and
for
to
-
morrow
's
victims
then
awaiting
their
doom
in
the
prisons
,
and
still
of
to
-
morrow
's
and
to
-
morrow
's
,
the
chain
of
association
that
brought
the
words
home
,
like
a
rusty
old
ship
's
anchor
from
the
deep
,
might
have
been
easily
found
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
seek
it
,
but
repeated
them
and
went
on
.
   
<EOS>
With
a
solemn
interest
in
the
lighted
windows
where
the
people
were
going
to
rest
,
forgetful
through
a
few
calm
hours
of
the
horrors
surrounding
them
;
in
the
towers
of
the
churches
,
where
no
prayers
were
said
,
for
the
popular
revulsion
had
even
travelled
that
length
of
self
-
destruction
from
years
of
priestly
impostors
,
plunderers
,
and
profligates
;
in
the
distant
burial
-
places
,
reserved
,
as
they
wrote
upon
the
gates
,
for
Eternal
Sleep
;
in
the
abounding
gaols
;
and
in
the
streets
along
which
the
sixties
rolled
to
a
death
which
had
become
so
common
and
material
,
that
no
sorrowful
story
of
a
haunting
Spirit
ever
arose
among
the
people
out
of
all
the
working
of
the
Guillotine
;
with
a
solemn
interest
in
the
whole
life
and
death
of
the
city
settling
down
to
its
short
nightly
pause
in
fury
;
Sydney
Carton
crossed
the
Seine
again
for
the
lighter
streets
.
   
<EOS>
Few
coaches
were
abroad
,
for
riders
in
coaches
were
liable
to
be
suspected
,
and
gentility
hid
its
head
in
red
nightcaps
,
and
put
on
heavy
shoes
,
and
trudged
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
theatres
were
all
well
filled
,
and
the
people
poured
cheerfully
out
as
he
passed
,
and
went
chatting
home
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
of
the
theatre
doors
,
there
was
a
little
girl
with
a
mother
,
looking
for
a
way
across
the
street
through
the
mud
.
<EOS>
He
carried
the
child
over
,
and
before
,
the
timid
arm
was
loosed
from
his
neck
asked
her
for
a
kiss
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
,
saith
the
Lord
:
 
he
that
believeth

whosoever

"
   
<EOS>
Now
,
that
the
streets
were
quiet
,
and
the
night
wore
on
,
the
words
were
in
the
echoes
of
his
feet
,
and
were
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
Perfectly
calm
and
steady
,
he
sometimes
repeated
them
to
himself
as
he
walked
;
but
,
he
heard
them
always
.
   
<EOS>
The
night
wore
out
,
and
,
as
he
stood
upon
the
bridge
listening
to
the
water
as
it
splashed
the
river
-
walls
of
the
Island
of
Paris
,
where
the
picturesque
confusion
of
houses
and
cathedral
shone
bright
in
the
light
of
the
moon
,
the
day
came
coldly
,
looking
like
a
dead
face
out
of
the
sky
.
<EOS>
Then
,
the
night
,
with
the
moon
and
the
stars
,
turned
pale
and
died
,
and
for
a
little
while
it
seemed
as
if
Creation
were
delivered
over
to
Death
's
dominion
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
the
glorious
sun
,
rising
,
seemed
to
strike
those
words
,
that
burden
of
the
night
,
straight
and
warm
to
his
heart
in
its
long
bright
rays
.
 
<EOS>
And
looking
along
them
,
with
reverently
shaded
eyes
,
a
bridge
of
light
appeared
to
span
the
air
between
him
and
the
sun
,
while
the
river
sparkled
under
it
.
   
<EOS>
The
strong
tide
,
so
swift
,
so
deep
,
and
certain
,
was
like
a
congenial
friend
,
in
the
morning
stillness
.
 
<EOS>
He
walked
by
the
stream
,
far
from
the
houses
,
and
in
the
light
and
warmth
of
the
sun
fell
asleep
on
the
bank
.
<EOS>
When
he
awoke
and
was
afoot
again
,
he
lingered
there
yet
a
little
longer
,
watching
an
eddy
that
turned
and
turned
purposeless
,
until
the
stream
absorbed
it
,
and
carried
it
on
to
the
sea
.
<EOS>
---
"
Like
me

"
   
<EOS>
A
trading
-
boat
,
with
a
sail
of
the
softened
colour
of
a
dead
leaf
,
then
glided
into
his
view
,
floated
by
him
,
and
died
away
.
 
<EOS>
As
its
silent
track
in
the
water
disappeared
,
the
prayer
that
had
broken
up
out
of
his
heart
for
a
merciful
consideration
of
all
his
poor
blindnesses
and
errors
,
ended
in
the
words
,
"
I
am
the

<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
was
already
out
when
he
got
back
,
and
it
was
easy
to
surmise
where
the
good
old
man
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Sydney
Carton
drank
nothing
but
a
tittle
coffee
,
ate
some
bread
,
and
,
having
washed
and
changed
to
refresh
himself
,
went
out
to
the
place
of
trial
.
   
<EOS>
The
court
was
all
astir
and
a
-
buzz
,
when
the
black
sheep
---
whom
many
fell
away
from
in
dread
---
pressed
him
into
an
obscure
corner
among
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
was
there
,
and
Doctor
Manette
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
there
,
sitting
beside
her
father
.
   
<EOS>
When
her
husband
was
brought
in
,
she
turned
a
look
upon
him
,
so
sustaining
,
so
encouraging
,
so
full
of
admiring
love
and
pitying
tenderness
,
yet
so
courageous
for
his
sake
,
that
it
called
the
healthy
blood
into
his
face
,
brightened
his
glance
,
and
animated
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
had
been
any
eyes
to
notice
the
influence
of
her
look
,
on
Sydney
Carton
,
it
would
have
been
seen
to
be
the
same
influence
exactly
.
   
<EOS>
Before
that
unjust
Tribunal
,
there
was
little
or
no
order
of
procedure
,
ensuring
to
any
accused
person
any
reasonable
hearing
.
<EOS>
There
could
have
been
no
such
Revolution
,
if
all
laws
,
forms
,
and
ceremonies
,
had
not
first
been
so
monstrously
abused
,
that
the
suicidal
vengeance
of
the
Revolution
was
to
scatter
them
all
to
the
winds
.
   
<EOS>
Every
eye
was
turned
to
the
jury
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
determined
patriots
and
good
republicans
as
yesterday
and
the
day
before
,
and
to

morrow
and
the
day
after
.
 
<EOS>
Eager
and
prominent
among
them
,
one
man
with
a
craving
face
,
and
his
fingers
perpetually
hovering
about
his
lips
,
whose
appearance
gave
great
satisfaction
to
the
spectators
.
 
<EOS>
A

thirsting

<EOS>
The
whole
jury
,
as
a

of

empannelled

Every
eye
then
turned
to
the
five
judges

the
public
prosecutor

<EOS>
No

quarter
to

<EOS>
A

uncompromising

<EOS>
murderous
business

Every
eye
then
sought
some
other
eye
in
the
crowd
,
and
gleamed
at
it
approvingly
;
and
heads
nodded
at

the

The

A
great
uproar
took
place
in
the
court
,
and
in
the
midst
of
it
,
Doctor
Manette
was
seen
,
pale
and
trembling
,
standing
where
he
had
been
seated
.
   
<EOS>
"
President
,
I
indignantly
protest
to
you
that
this

a
forgery

a
fraud

<EOS>
You
know

accused

<EOS>
My

those
dear

are
far
dearer
to
me

<EOS>
Who
and
<EOS>
where
is
the
false
conspirator
who
says
that
I
denounce
the
husband

<EOS>
"
Citizen
Manette
,
be
tranquil
.
 
<EOS>
To
fail
in
submission
to
the
authority
of
the
Tribunal
would
be
to
put
yourself
out
of
Law
.
<EOS>
As
to
what
is
dearer
to
you
than
life
,
nothing
can
be
so
dear
to
a
good
citizen
as
the
Republic
.
"
   
<EOS>
Loud
acclamations
hailed
this
rebuke
.
 
<EOS>
The
President
rang
his
bell
,
and
with
warmth
resumed
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
the
Republic
should
demand
of
you
the
sacrifice

your

herself

you
would
have
no
duty

to
sacrifice
her

Listen

In

<EOS>
Frantic
acclamations
were
again
raised

<EOS>
Doctor
Manette
sat
down
,
with
his
eyes
looking
around
,
and
his
lips
trembling
;
his
daughter
drew
closer
to
him

<EOS>
The
craving
man
on
the
jury
rubbed
his
hands
together
,
and
restored
the
usual
hand
to
his
mouth
.
   
<EOS>
Defarge
was
produced
,
when
the
court
was
quiet
enough
to
admit
of
his
being
heard
,
and
rapidly
expounded
the
story
of
the
imprisonment
,
and
of
his
having
been
a
mere
boy
in
the
Doctor

service
,
and
of
the
release
,
and
of
the
state
of
the
prisoner
when
released
and
delivered
to

<EOS>
This
short
examination
followed
,
for
the
court
was
quick
with
its
work

"
You

Here

an

screeched
from

It
was

thus
assisted

rang

warming

encouragement

shrieked
,

looking
down
at

who
stood
at
the
bottom

the
steps
on

he
was
raised

looking
steadily
up
at

I
knew

been
confined

fall

In

I
write
it
at
stolen
intervals
,
under
every
difficulty
.
<EOS>
I
design
to
secrete
it
in
the
wall
of
the
chimney
,
where
I
have
slowly
and
laboriously
made
a
place
of
concealment
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Some
pitying
hand
may
find
it
there
,
when
I
and
my
sorrows
are
dust
.

These
words
are
formed
by
the
rusty
iron
point
with
which
I
write
with
difficulty
in
scrapings
of
soot
and
charcoal
from
the
chimney
,
mixed
with
blood
,
in
the
last
month
of
the
tenth
year
of
my
captivity
.
<EOS>
Hope
has
quite
departed
from
my
breast
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
from
terrible
warnings
I
have
noted
in
myself
that
my
reason
will
not
long
remain
unimpaired
,
but
I
solemnly
declare
that
I
am
at
this
time
in
the
possession
of
my
right
mind
---
that
my
memory
is
exact
and
circumstantial
---
and
that
I
write
the
truth
as
I
shall
answer
for
these
my
last
recorded
words
,
whether
they
be
ever
read
by
men
or
not
,
at
the
Eternal
Judgment

"
One
cloudy
moonlight
night
,
in
the
third
week
of
December
(
I
think
the
twenty
-
second
of
the
month
)
in
the
year
1757
,
I
was
walking
on
a
retired
part
of
the
quay
by
the
Seine
for
the
refreshment
of
the
frosty
air
,
at
an
hour
's
distance
from
my
place
of
residence
in
the
Street
of
the
School
of
Medicine
,
when
a
carriage
came
along
behind
me
,
driven
very
fast
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
stood
aside
to
let
that
carriage
pass
,
apprehensive
that
it
might
otherwise
run
me
down
,
a
head
was
put
out
at
the
window
,
and
a
voice
called
to
the
driver
to
stop
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
carriage
stopped
as
soon
as
the
driver
could
rein
in
his
horses
,
and
the
same
voice
called
to
me
by
my
name
.
 
<EOS>
I
answered
.
 
<EOS>
The
carriage
was
then
so
far
in
advance
of
me
that
two
gentlemen
had
time
to
open
the
door
and
alight
before
I
came
up
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
observed
that
they
were
both
wrapped
in
cloaks
,
and
appeared
to
conceal
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
stood
side
by
side
near
the
carriage
door
,
I
also
observed
that
they
both
looked
of
about
my
own
age
,
or
rather
younger
,
and
that
they
were
greatly
alike
,
in
stature
,
manner
,
voice
,
and
(
as
far
as
I
could
see
)
face
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
You
are
Doctor
Manette
?
"
said
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
Doctor
Manette
,
formerly
of
Beauvais
,
"
said
the
other
;
"
the
young
physician
,
originally
an
expert
surgeon
,
who
within
the
last
year
or
two
has
made
a
rising
reputation
in
Paris
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
Gentlemen
,
"
I
returned
,
"
I
am
that
Doctor
Manette
of
whom
you
speak
so
graciously
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
We
have
been
to
your
residence
,
"
said
the
first
,
"
and
not
being
so
fortunate
as
to
find
you
there
,
and
being
informed
that
you
were
probably
walking
in
this
direction
,
we
followed
,
in
the
hope
of
overtaking
you
.
<EOS>
Will
you
please
to
enter
the
carriage
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
manner
of
both
was
imperious
,
and
they
both
moved
,
as
these
words
were
spoken
,
so
as
to
place
me
between
themselves
and
the
carriage
door
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
armed
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Gentlemen
,
"
said
I
,
"
pardon
me
;
but
I
usually
inquire
who
does
me
the
honour
to
seek
my
assistance
,
and
what
is
the
nature
of
the
case
to
which
I
am
summoned
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
reply
to
this
was
made
by
him
who
had
spoken
second
.
"
<EOS>
Doctor
,
your
clients
are
people
of
condition
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
nature
of
the
case
,
our
confidence
in
your
skill
assures
us
that
you
will
ascertain
it
for
yourself
better
than
we
can
describe
it
.
 
<EOS>
Enough
.
<EOS>
Will
you
please
to
enter
the
carriage
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
do
nothing
but
comply
,
and
I
entered
it
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
entered
after
me
---
the
last
springing
in
,
after
putting
up
the
steps
.
 
<EOS>
The
carriage
turned
about
,
and
drove
on
at
its
former
speed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
this
conversation
exactly
as
it
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
that
it
is
,
word
for
word
,
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
I
describe
everything
exactly
as
it
took
place
,
constraining
my
mind
not
to
wander
from
the
task
.
<EOS>
Where
I
make
the
broken
marks
that
follow
here
,
I
leave
off
for
the
time
,
and
put
my
paper
in
its
hiding
-
place
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
carriage
left
the
streets
behind
,
passed
the
North
Barrier
,
and
emerged
upon
the
country
road
.
 
<EOS>
At
two
-
thirds
of
a
league
from
the
Barrier
---
I
did
not
estimate
the
distance
at
that
time
,
but
afterwards
when
I
traversed
it
---
it
struck
out
of
the
main
avenue
,
and
presently
stopped
at
a
solitary
house
,
<EOS>
We
all
three
alighted
,
and
walked
,
by
a
damp
soft
footpath
in
a
garden
where
a
neglected
fountain
had
overflowed
,
to
the
door
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
opened
immediately
,
in
answer
to
the
ringing
of
the
bell
,
and
one
of
my
two
conductors
struck
the
man
who
opened
it
,
with
his
heavy
riding
glove
,
across
the
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
was
nothing
in
this
action
to
attract
my
particular
attention
,
for
I
had
seen
common
people
struck
more
commonly
than
dogs
.
<EOS>
But
,
the
other
of
the
two
,
being
angry
likewise
,
struck
the
man
in
like
manner
with
his
arm
;
the
look
and
bearing
of
the
brothers
were
then
so
exactly
alike
,
that
I
then
first
perceived
them
to
be
twin
brothers
.
   
<EOS>
"
From
the
time
of
our
alighting
at
the
outer
gate
(
which
we
found
locked
,
and
which
one
of
the
brothers
had
opened
to
admit
us
,
and
had
relocked
)
,
I
had
heard
cries
proceeding
from
an
upper
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
conducted
to
this
chamber
straight
,
the
cries
growing
louder
as
we
ascended
the
stairs
,
and
I
found
a
patient
in
a
high
fever
of
the
brain
,
lying
on
a
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
patient
was
a
woman
of
great
beauty
,
and
young
;
assuredly
not
much
past
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
Her
hair
was
torn
and
ragged
,
and
her
arms
were
bound
to
her
sides
with
sashes
and
handkerchiefs
.
 
<EOS>
I
noticed
that
these
bonds
were
all
portions
of
a
gentleman
's
dress
.
 
<EOS>
On
one
of
them
,
which
was
a
fringed
scarf
for
a
dress
of
ceremony
,
I
saw
the
armorial
bearings
of
a
Noble
,
and
the
letter
E.
   
<EOS>
"
I
saw
this
,
within
the
first
minute
of
my
contemplation
of
the
patient
;
for
,
in
her
restless
strivings
she
had
turned
over
on
her
face
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
,
had
drawn
the
end
of
the
scarf
into
her
mouth
,
and
was
in
danger
of
suffocation
.
 
<EOS>
My
first
act
was
to
put
out
my
hand
to
relieve
her
breathing
;
and
in
moving
the
scarf
aside
,
the
embroidery
in
the
corner
caught
my
sight
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
turned
her
gently
over
,
placed
my
hands
upon
her
breast
to
calm
her
and
keep
her
down
,
and
looked
into
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
dilated
and
wild
,
and
she
constantly
uttered
piercing
shrieks
,
and
repeated
the
words
,
"
My
husband
,
my
father
,
and
my
brother
!
"
 
and
then
counted
up
to
twelve
,
and
said
,
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
For
an
instant
,
and
no
more
,
she
would
pause
to
listen
,
and
then
the
piercing
shrieks
would
begin
again
,
and
she
would
repeat
the
cry
,
"
My
husband
,
my
father
,
and
my
brother
!
"
and
would
count
up
to
twelve
,
and
say
,
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
There
was
no
variation
in
the
order
,
or
the
manner
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
cessation
,
but
the
regular
moment
's
pause
,
in
the
utterance
of
these
sounds
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
How
long
,
"
I
asked
,
"
has
this
lasted
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
distinguish
the
brothers
,
I
will
call
them
the
elder
and
the
younger
;
by
the
elder
,
I
mean
him
who
exercised
the
most
authority
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
elder
who
replied
,
"
Since
about
this
hour
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
She
has
a
husband
,
a
father
,
and
a
brother
?
"
   
"
"
A
brother
.
"
   
"
"
I
do
not
address
her
brother
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
answered
with
great
contempt
,
"
No
.
"
   
"
"
She
has
some
recent
association
with
the
number
twelve
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
younger
brother
impatiently
rejoined
,
"
With
twelve
o'clock
?
"
   
"
"
See
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
I
,
still
keeping
my
hands
upon
her
breast
,
"
how
useless
I
am
,
as
you
have
brought
me
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
known
what
I
was
coming
to
see
,
I
could
have
come
provided
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
time
must
be
lost
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
no
medicines
to
be
obtained
in
this
lonely
place
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
elder
brother
looked
to
the
younger
,
who
said
haughtily
,
"
There
is
a
case
of
medicines
here
;
"
and
brought
it
from
a
closet
,
and
put
it
on
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
opened
some
of
the
bottles
,
smelt
them
,
and
put
the
stoppers
to
my
lips
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
wanted
to
use
anything
save
narcotic
medicines
that
were
poisons
in
themselves
,
I
would
not
have
administered
any
of
those
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Do
you
doubt
them
?
"
asked
the
younger
brother
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
monsieur
,
I
am
going
to
use
them
,
"
I
replied
,
and
said
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
made
the
patient
swallow
,
with
great
difficulty
,
and
after
many
efforts
,
the
dose
that
I
desired
to
give
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
intended
to
repeat
it
after
a
while
,
and
as
it
was
necessary
to
watch
its
influence
,
I
then
sat
down
by
the
side
of
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
timid
and
suppressed
woman
in
attendance
(
wife
of
the
man
down
-
stairs
)
,
who
had
retreated
into
a
corner
.
<EOS>
The
house
was
damp
and
decayed
,
indifferently
furnished
---
evidently
,
recently
occupied
and
temporarily
used
.
<EOS>
Some
thick
old
hangings
had
been
nailed
up
before
the
windows
,
to
deaden
the
sound
of
the
shrieks
.
 
<EOS>
They
continued
to
be
uttered
in
their
regular
succession
,
with
the
cry
,
"
My
husband
,
my
father
,
and
my
brother
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
counting
up
to
twelve
,
and
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
The
frenzy
was
so
violent
,
that
I
had
not
unfastened
the
bandages
restraining
the
arms
;
but
,
I
had
looked
to
them
,
to
see
that
they
were
not
painful
.
<EOS>
The
only
spark
of
encouragement
in
the
case
,
was
,
that
my
hand
upon
the
sufferer
's
breast
had
this
much
soothing
influence
,
that
for
minutes
at
a
time
it
tranquillised
the
figure
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
no
effect
upon
the
cries
;
no
pendulum
could
be
more
regular
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
the
reason
that
my
hand
had
this
effect
(
I
assume
)
,
I
had
sat
by
the
side
of
the
bed
for
half
an
hour
,
with
the
two
brothers
looking
on
,
before
the
elder
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
"
There
is
another
patient
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
startled
,
and
asked
,
"
Is
it
a
pressing
case
?
"
   
"
"
You
had
better
see
,
"
he
carelessly
answered
;
and
took
up
a
light
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
other
patient
lay
in
a
back
room
across
a
second
staircase
,
which
was
a
species
of
loft
over
a
stable
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
low
plastered
ceiling
to
a
part
of
it
;
the
rest
was
open
,
to
the
ridge
of
the
tiled
roof
,
and
there
were
beams
across
.
 
<EOS>
Hay
and
straw
were
stored
in
that
portion
of
the
place
,
fagots
for
firing
,
and
a
heap
of
apples
in
sand
.
<EOS>
I
had
to
pass
through
that
part
,
to
get
at
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
My
memory
is
circumstantial
and
unshaken
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
it
with
these
details
,
and
I
see
them
all
,
in
this
my
cell
in
the
Bastille
,
near
the
close
of
the
tenth
year
of
my
captivity
,
as
I
saw
them
all
that
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
On
some
hay
on
the
ground
,
with
a
cushion
thrown
under
his
head
,
lay
a
handsome
peasant
boy
---
a
boy
of
not
more
than
seventeen
at
the
most
.
<EOS>
He
lay
on
his
back
,
with
his
teeth
set
,
his
right
hand
clenched
on
his
breast
,
and
his
glaring
eyes
looking
straight
upward
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
where
his
wound
was
,
as
I
kneeled
on
one
knee
over
him
;
but
,
I
could
see
that
he
was
dying
of
a
wound
from
a
sharp
point
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
am
a
doctor
,
my
poor
fellow
,
"
said
I.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
examine
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
do
not
want
it
examined
,
"
he
answered
;
"
let
it
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
under
his
hand
,
and
I
soothed
him
to
let
me
move
his
hand
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
wound
was
a
sword
-
thrust
,
received
from
twenty
to
twenty
-
four
hours
before
,
but
no
skill
could
have
saved
him
if
it
had
been
looked
to
without
delay
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
then
dying
fast
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
turned
my
eyes
to
the
elder
brother
,
I
saw
him
looking
down
at
this
handsome
boy
whose
life
was
ebbing
out
,
as
if
he
were
a
wounded
bird
,
or
hare
,
or
rabbit
;
not
at
all
as
if

"
"
How
has
this
been
done
,
monsieur
?
"
said
I.
   
"
"
A
crazed
young
common
dog
!
 
<EOS>
A
serf
!
 
<EOS>
Forced
my
brother
to
draw
upon
him
,
and
has
fallen
by
my
brother
's
sword
---
like
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
touch
of
pity
,
sorrow
,
or
kindred
humanity
,
in
this
answer
.
 
<EOS>
The
speaker
seemed
to
acknowledge
that
it
was
inconvenient
to
have
that
different
order
of
creature
dying
there
,
and
that
it
would
have
been
better
if
he
had
died
in
the
usual
obscure
routine
of
his
vermin
kind
.
<EOS>
He
was
quite
incapable
of
any
compassionate
feeling
about
the
boy
,
or
about
his
fate
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
boy
's
eyes
had
slowly
moved
to
him
as
he
had
spoken
,
and
they
now
slowly
moved
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Doctor
,
they
are
very
proud
,
these
Nobles
;
but
we
common
dogs
are
proud
too
,
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
They
plunder
us
,
outrage
us
,
beat
us
,
kill
us
;
but
we
have
a
little
pride
left
,
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
She
---
have
you
seen
her
,
Doctor
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
shrieks
and
the
cries
were
audible
there
,
though
subdued
by
the
distance
.
 
<EOS>
He
referred
to
them
,
as
if
she
were
lying
in
our
presence
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
"
I
have
seen
her
.
"
   
"
"
She
is
my
sister
,
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
had
their
shameful
rights
,
these
Nobles
,
in
the
modesty
and
virtue
of
our
sisters
,
many
years
,
but
we
have
had
good
girls
among
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
,
and
have
heard
my
father
say
so
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
good
girl
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
betrothed
to
a
good
young
man
,
too
:
 
a
tenant
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
all
tenants
of
his
---
that
man
's
who
stands
there
.
<EOS>
The
other
is
his
brother
,
the
worst
of
a
bad
race
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
the
boy
gathered
bodily
force
to
speak
;
but
,
his
spirit
spoke
with
a
dreadful
emphasis
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
We
were
so
robbed
by
that
man
who
stands
there
,
as
an
we
common
dogs
are
by
those
superior
Beings
---
taxed
by
him
without
mercy
,
obliged
to
work
for
him
without
pay
,
obliged
to
grind
our
corn
at
his
mill
,
obliged
to
feed
scores
of
his
tame
birds
on
our
wretched
crops
,
and
forbidden
for
our
lives
to
keep
a
single
tame
bird
of
our
own
,
pillaged
and
plundered
to
that
degree
that
when
we
chanced
to
have
a
bit
of
meat
,
we
ate
it
in
fear
,
with
the
door
barred
and
the
shutters
closed
,
that
his
people
should
not
see
it
and
take
it
from
us
<EOS>
---
I
say
,
we
were
so
robbed
,
and
hunted
,
and
were
made
so
poor
,
that
our
father
told
us
it
was
a
dreadful
thing
to
bring
a
child
into
the
world
,
and
that
what
we
should
most
pray
for
,
was
,
that
our
women
might
be
barren
and
our
miserable
race
die
out
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
never
before
seen
the
sense
of
being
oppressed
,
bursting
forth
like
a
fire
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
supposed
that
it
must
be
latent
in
the
people
somewhere
;
but
,
I
had
never
seen
it
break
out
,
until
I
saw
it
in
the
dying
boy
.
   
"
<EOS>
"
Nevertheless
,
Doctor
,
my
sister
married
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
ailing
at
that
time
,
poor
fellow
,
and
she
married
her
lover
,
that
she
might
tend
and
comfort
him
in
our
cottage
---
our
dog
-
hut
,
as
that
man
would
call
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
been
married
many
weeks
,
when
that
man
's
brother
saw
her
and
admired
her
,
and
asked
that
man
to
lend
her
to
him
---
for
what
are
husbands
among
us
!
 
<EOS>
He
was
willing
enough
,
but
my
sister
was
good
and
virtuous
,
and
hated
his
brother
with
a
hatred
as
strong
as
mine
.
<EOS>
What
did
the
two
then
,
to
persuade
her
husband
to
use
his
influence
with
her
,
to
make
her
willing
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
boy
's
eyes
,
which
had
been
fixed
on
mine
,
slowly
turned
to
the
looker
-
on
,
and
I
saw
in
the
two
faces
that
all
he
said
was
true
.
<EOS>
The
two
opposing
kinds
of
pride
confronting
one
another
,
I
can
see
,
even
in
this
Bastille
;
the
gentleman
's
,
all
negligent
indifference
;
the
peasants
,
all
trodden
-
down
sentiment
,
and
passionate
revenge
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
Doctor
,
that
it
is
among
the
Rights
of
these
Nobles
to
harness
us
common
dogs
to
carts
,
and
drive
us
.
 
<EOS>
They
so
harnessed
him
and
drove
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
it
is
among
their
Rights
to
keep
us
in
their
grounds
all
night
,
quieting
the
frogs
,
in
order
that
their
noble
sleep
may
not
be
disturbed
.
 
<EOS>
They
kept
him
out
in
the
unwholesome
mists
at
night
,
and
ordered
him
back
into
his
harness
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
persuaded
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
Taken
out
of
harness
one
day
at
noon
,
to
feed
<EOS>
---
if
he
could
find
food
---
he
sobbed
twelve
times
,
once
for
every
stroke
of
the
bell
,
and
died
on
her
bosom
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
human
could
have
held
life
in
the
boy
but
his
determination
to
tell
all
his
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
He
forced
back
the
gathering
shadows
of
death
,
as
he
forced
his
clenched
right
hand
to
remain
clenched
,
and
to
cover
his
wound
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Then
,
with
that
man
's
permission
and
even
with
his
aid
,
his
brother
took
her
away
;
in
spite
of
what
I
know
she
must
have
told
his
brother
---
and
what
that
is
,
will
not
be
long
unknown
to
you
,
Doctor
,
if
it
is
now
---
his
brother
took
her
away
---
for
his
pleasure
and
diversion
,
for
a
little
while
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
her
pass
me
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
When
I
took
the
tidings
home
,
our
father
's
heart
burst
;
he
never
spoke
one
of
the
words
that
fined
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
my
young
sister
(
for
I
have
another
)
to
a
place
beyond
the
reach
of
this
man
,
and
where
,
at
least
,
she
will
never
be
HIS
vassal
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
I
tracked
the
brother
here
,
and
last
night
climbed
in
---
a
common
dog
,
but
sword
in
hand
.
<EOS>
---
Where
is
the
loft
window
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
somewhere
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
room
was
darkening
to
his
sight
;
the
world
was
narrowing
around
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
glanced
about
me
,
and
saw
that
the
hay
and
straw
were
trampled
over
the
floor
,
as
if
there
had
been
a
struggle
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
She
heard
me
,
and
ran
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
not
to
come
near
us
till
he
was
dead
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
in
and
first
tossed
me
some
pieces
of
money
;
then
struck
at
me
with
a
whip
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
,
though
a
common
dog
,
so
struck
at
him
as
to
make
him
draw
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
break
into
as
many
pieces
as
he
will
,
the
sword
that
he
stained
with
my
common
blood
;
he
drew
to
defend
himself
---
thrust
at
me
with
all
his
skill
for
his
life
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
glance
had
fallen
,
but
a
few
moments
before
,
on
the
fragments
of
a
broken
sword
,
lying
among
the
hay
.
 
<EOS>
That
weapon
was
a
gentleman
's
.
<EOS>
In
another
place
,
lay
an
old
sword
that
seemed
to
have
been
a
soldier
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Now
,
lift
me
up
,
Doctor
;
lift
me
up
.
 
<EOS>
Where
is
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
He
is
not
here
,
"
I
said
,
supporting
the
boy
,
and
thinking
that
he
referred
to
the
brother
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
He
!
 
<EOS>
Proud
<EOS>
as
these
nobles
are
,
he
is
afraid
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
Where
is
the
man
who
was
here
?
 
<EOS>
turn
my
face
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
so
,
raising
the
boy
's
head
against
my
knee
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
invested
for
the
moment
with
extraordinary
power
,
he
raised
himself
completely
:
obliging
me
to
rise
too
,
or
I
could
not
have
still
supported
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Marquis
,
"
said
the
boy
,
turned
to
him
with
his
eyes
opened
wide
,
and
his
right
hand
raised
,
"
in
the
days
when
all
these
things
are
to
be
answered
for
<EOS>
,
I
summon
you
and
yours
,
to
the
last
of
your
bad
race
,
to
answer
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
mark
this
cross
of
blood
upon
you
,
as
a
sign
that
I
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
days
when
all
these
things
are
to
be
answered
for
,
I
summon
your
brother
,
the
worst
of
the
bad
race
,
to
answer
for
them
separately
.
<EOS>
I
mark
this
cross
of
blood
upon
him
,
as
a
sign
that
I
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Twice
,
he
put
his
hand
to
the
wound
in
his
breast
,
and
with
his
forefinger
drew
a
cross
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
for
an
instant
with
the
finger
yet
raised
,
and
as
it
dropped
,
he
dropped
with
it
,
and
I
laid
him
down
dead
.
     
<EOS>
"
When
I
returned
to
the
bedside
of
the
young
woman
,
I
found
her
raving
in
precisely
the
same
order
of
continuity
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
that
this
might
last
for
many
hours
,
and
that
it
would
probably
end
in
the
silence
of
the
grave
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
the
medicines
I
had
given
her
,
and
I
sat
at
the
side
of
the
bed
until
the
night
was
far
advanced
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
abated
the
piercing
quality
of
her
shrieks
,
never
stumbled
in
the
distinctness
or
the
order
of
her
words
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
always
"
My
husband
,
my
father
,
and
my
brother
!
 
<EOS>
One
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
five
,
six
,
seven
,
eight
,
nine
,
ten
,
eleven
,
twelve
.
<EOS>
Hush
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
lasted
twenty
-
six
hours
from
the
time
when
I
first
saw
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
come
and
gone
twice
,
and
was
again
sitting
by
her
,
when
she
began
to
falter
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
what
little
could
be
done
to
assist
that
opportunity
,
and
by
-
and
-
bye
<EOS>
she
sank
into
a
lethargy
,
and
lay
like
the
dead
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
as
if
the
wind
and
rain
had
lulled
at
last
,
after
a
long
and
fearful
storm
.
 
<EOS>
I
released
her
arms
,
and
called
the
woman
to
assist
me
to
compose
her
figure
and
the
dress
she
had
tom
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
then
that
I
knew
her
condition
to
be
that
of
one
in
whom
the
first
expectations
of
being
a
mother
have
arisen
;
and
it
was
then
that
I
lost
the
little
hope
I
had
had
of
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Is
she
dead
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
Marquis
,
whom
I
will
still
describe
as
the
elder
brother
,
coming
booted
into
the
room
from
his
horse
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Not
dead
,
"
said
I
;
"
<EOS>
but
like
to
die
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
What
strength
there
is
in
these
common
bodies
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
looking
down
at
her
with
some
curiosity
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
There
is
prodigious
strength
,
"
I
answered
him
,
"
in
sorrow
and
despair
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
first
laughed
at
my
words
,
and
then
frowned
at
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
moved
a
chair
with
his
foot
near
to
mine
,
ordered
the
woman
away
,
and
said
in
a
subdued
voice
,
   
"
"
<EOS>
Doctor
,
finding
my
brother
in
this
difficulty
with
these
hinds
<EOS>
,
I
recommended
that
your
aid
should
be
invited
.
 
<EOS>
Your
reputation
is
high
,
and
,
as
a
young
man
with
your
fortune
to
make
,
you
are
probably
mindful
of
your
interest
.
 
<EOS>
The
things
that
you
see
here
,
are
things
to
be
seen
,
and
not
spoken
of
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
listened
to
the
patient
's
breathing
,
and
avoided
answering
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Do
you
honour
me
with
your
attention
,
Doctor
?
"
   
"
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
"
said
I
,
"
in
my
profession
,
the
communications
of
patients
are
always
received
in
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
guarded
in
my
answer
,
for
I
was
troubled
in
my
mind
with
what
I
had
heard
and
seen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Her
breathing
was
so
difficult
to
trace
,
that
I
carefully
tried
the
pulse
and
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
life
,
and
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
round
as
I
resumed
my
seat
<EOS>
,
I
found
both
the
brothers
intent
upon
me
.
     
<EOS>
"
I
write
with
so
much
difficulty
,
the
cold
is
so
severe
<EOS>
,
I
am
so
fearful
of
being
detected
and
consigned
to
an
underground
cell
and
total
darkness
,
that
I
must
abridge
this
narrative
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
confusion
or
failure
in
my
memory
;
it
can
recall
,
and
could
detail
,
every
word
that
was
ever
spoken
between
me
and
those
brothers
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
lingered
for
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
Towards
the
last
,
I
could
understand
some
few
syllables
that
she
said
to
me
,
by
placing
my
ear
close
to
her
lips
.
<EOS>
She
asked
me
where
she
was
,
and
I
told
her
;
who
I
was
,
and
I
told
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
that
I
asked
her
for
her
family
name
.
 
<EOS>
She
faintly
shook
her
head
upon
the
pillow
,
and
kept
her
secret
,
as
the
boy
had
done
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
no
opportunity
of
asking
her
any
question
,
until
I
had
told
the
brothers
she
was
sinking
fast
,
and
could
not
live
another
day
.
<EOS>
Until
then
,
though
no
one
was
ever
presented
to
her
consciousness
save
the
woman
and
myself
,
one
or
other
of
them
had
always
jealously
sat
behind
the
curtain
at
the
head
of
the
bed
when
I
was
there
.
<EOS>
But
when
it
came
to
that
,
they
seemed
careless
what
communication
I
might
hold
with
her
;
as
if
---
the
thought
passed
through
my
mind
---
I
were
dying
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
always
observed
that
their
pride
bitterly
resented
the
younger
brother
's
(
as
I
call
him
)
having
crossed
swords
with
a
peasant
,
and
that
peasant
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
consideration
that
appeared
to
affect
the
mind
of
either
of
them
was
the
consideration
that
this
was
highly
degrading
to
the
family
,
and
was
ridiculous
.
 
<EOS>
As
often
as
I
caught
the
younger
brother
's
eyes
,
their
expression
reminded
me
that
he
disliked
me
deeply
,
for
knowing
what
I
knew
from
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
smoother
and
more
polite
to
me
than
the
elder
;
but
I
saw
this
.
<EOS>
I
also
saw
that
I
was
an
incumbrance
in
the
mind
of
the
elder
,
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
patient
died
,
two
hours
before
midnight
---
at
a
time
,
by
my
watch
,
answering
almost
to
the
minute
when
I
had
first
seen
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
alone
with
her
,
when
her
forlorn
young
head
drooped
gently
on
one
side
,
and
all
her
earthly
wrongs
and
sorrows
ended
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
brothers
were
waiting
in
a
room
down
-
stairs
,
impatient
to
ride
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
heard
them
,
alone
at
the
bedside
,
striking
their
boots
with
their
riding
-
whips
,
and
loitering
up
and
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
last
she
is
dead
?
"
said
the
elder
,
when
I
went
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
dead
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
congratulate
you
,
my
brother
,
"
were
his
words
as
he
turned
round
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
had
before
offered
me
money
,
which
I
had
postponed
taking
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
gave
me
a
rouleau
of
gold
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
it
from
his
hand
,
but
laid
it
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
considered
the
question
,
and
had
resolved
to
accept
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Pray
excuse
me
,
"
said
I.
"
<EOS>
Under
the
circumstances
,
no
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
exchanged
looks
,
but
bent
their
heads
to
me
as
I
bent
mine
to
them
,
and
we
parted
without
another
word
on
either
side
.
     
<EOS>
"
I
am
weary
,
weary
,
weary
-
worn
down
by
misery
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
read
what
I
have
written
with
this
gaunt
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Early
in
the
morning
,
the
rouleau
of
gold
was
left
at
my
door
in
a
little
box
,
with
my
name
on
the
outside
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
first
,
I
had
anxiously
considered
what
I
ought
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
decided
,
that
day
,
to
write
privately
to
the
Minister
,
stating
the
nature
of
the
two
cases
to
which
I
had
been
summoned
,
and
the
place
to
which
I
had
gone
:
 
in
effect
,
stating
all
the
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
what
Court
influence
was
,
and
what
the
immunities
of
the
Nobles
were
,
and
I
expected
that
the
matter
would
never
be
heard
of
;
<EOS>
but
,
I
wished
to
relieve
my
own
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
kept
the
matter
a
profound
secret
,
even
from
my
wife
;
and
this
<EOS>
,
too
,
I
resolved
to
state
in
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
apprehension
whatever
of
my
real
danger
;
but
I
was
conscious
that
there
might
be
danger
for
others
,
if
others
were
compromised
by
possessing
the
knowledge
that
I
possessed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
much
engaged
that
day
,
and
could
not
complete
my
letter
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
rose
long
before
my
usual
time
next
morning
to
finish
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
last
day
of
the
year
.
 
<EOS>
The
letter
was
lying
before
me
just
completed
,
when
I
was
told
that
a
lady
waited
,
who
wished
to
see
me
.
     
<EOS>
"
I
am
growing
more
and
more
unequal
to
the
task
I
have
set
myself
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
cold
,
so
dark
,
my
senses
are
so
benumbed
,
and
the
gloom
upon
me
is
so
dreadful
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
lady
was
young
,
engaging
,
and
handsome
,
but
not
marked
for
long
life
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
in
great
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
She
presented
herself
to
me
as
the
wife
of
the
Marquis
St
Evremonde
.
 
<EOS>
I
connected
the
title
by
which
the
boy
had
addressed
the
elder
brother
,
with
the
initial
letter
embroidered
on
the
scarf
,
and
had
no
difficulty
in
arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
I
had
seen
that
nobleman
very
lately
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
memory
is
still
accurate
,
but
I
can
not
write
the
words
of
our
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
I
suspect
that
I
am
watched
more
closely
than
I
was
,
and
I
know
not
at
what
times
I
may
be
watched
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
in
part
suspected
,
and
in
part
discovered
,
the
main
facts
of
the
cruel
story
,
of
her
husband
's
share
in
it
,
and
my
being
resorted
to
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
know
that
the
girl
was
dead
.
 
<EOS>
Her
hope
had
been
,
she
said
in
great
distress
,
to
show
her
,
in
secret
,
a
woman
's
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
Her
hope
had
been
to
avert
the
wrath
of
Heaven
from
a
House
that
had
long
been
hateful
to
the
suffering
many
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
had
reasons
for
believing
that
there
was
a
young
sister
living
,
and
her
greatest
desire
was
,
to
help
that
sister
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
tell
her
nothing
but
<EOS>
that
there
was
such
a
sister
;
beyond
that
,
I
knew
nothing
.
<EOS>
Her
inducement
to
come
to
me
,
relying
on
my
confidence
,
had
been
the
hope
that
I
could
tell
her
the
name
and
place
of
abode
.
 
<EOS>
Whereas
,
to
this
wretched
hour
I
am
ignorant
of
both
.
     
<EOS>
"
These
scraps
of
paper
fail
me
.
 
<EOS>
One
was
taken
from
me
,
with
a
warning
,
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
finish
my
record
to
-
day
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
was
a
good
,
compassionate
lady
,
and
not
happy
in
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
How
could
she
be
!
 
<EOS>
The
brother
distrusted
and
disliked
her
,
and
his
influence
was
all
opposed
to
her
;
she
stood
in
dread
of
him
,
and
in
dread
of
her
husband
too
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
handed
her
down
to
the
door
,
there
was
a
child
,
a
pretty
boy
from
two
to
three
years
old
,
in
her
carriage
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
For
his
sake
,
Doctor
,
"
she
said
,
pointing
to
him
in
tears
,
"
I
would
do
all
I
can
to
make
what
poor
amends
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
never
prosper
in
his
inheritance
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
presentiment
that
if
no
other
innocent
atonement
is
made
for
this
,
it
will
one
day
be
required
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
have
left
to
call
my
own
---
it
is
little
beyond
the
worth
of
a
few
jewels
---
I
will
make
it
the
first
charge
of
his
life
to
bestow
,
with
the
compassion
and
lamenting
of
his
dead
mother
,
on
this
injured
family
,
if
the
sister
can
be
discovered
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
kissed
the
boy
,
and
said
,
caressing
him
,
"
It
is
for
thine
own
dear
sake
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
wilt
be
faithful
,
little
Charles
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
child
answered
her
bravely
,
"
Yes
!
"
<EOS>
I
kissed
her
hand
,
and
she
took
him
in
her
arms
,
and
went
away
caressing
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
her
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
As
she
had
mentioned
her
husband
's
name
in
the
faith
that
I
knew
it
,
I
added
no
mention
of
it
to
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
sealed
my
letter
,
and
,
not
trusting
it
out
of
my
own
hands
,
delivered
it
myself
that
day
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
night
,
the
last
night
of
the
year
,
towards
nine
o'clock
,
a
man
in
a
black
dress
rang
at
my
gate
,
demanded
to
see
me
,
and
softly
followed
my
servant
,
Ernest
Defarge
,
a
youth
,
up
-
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
When
my
servant
came
into
the
room
where
I
sat
with
my
wife
---
O
my
wife
,
beloved
of
my
heart
!
 
<EOS>
My
fair
young
English
wife
!
<EOS>
---
we
saw
the
man
,
who
was
supposed
to
be
at
the
gate
,
standing
silent
behind
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
An
urgent
case
in
the
Rue
St
Honore
,
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
not
detain
me
,
he
had
a
coach
in
waiting
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
brought
me
here
,
it
brought
me
to
my
grave
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
was
clear
of
the
house
,
a
black
muffler
was
drawn
tightly
over
my
mouth
from
behind
,
and
my
arms
were
pinioned
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
brothers
crossed
the
road
from
a
dark
corner
,
and
identified
me
with
a
single
gesture
.
 
<EOS>
The
Marquis
took
from
his
pocket
the
letter
I
had
written
,
showed
it
me
,
burnt
it
in
the
light
of
a
lantern
that
was
held
,
and
extinguished
the
ashes
with
his
foot
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
brought
here
<EOS>
,
I
was
brought
to
my
living
grave
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
had
pleased
GOD
to
put
it
in
the
hard
heart
of
either
of
the
brothers
,
in
all
these
frightful
years
,
to
grant
me
any
tidings
of
my
dearest
wife
---
so
much
as
to
let
me
know
by
a
word
whether
alive
or
dead
---
I
might
have
thought
that
He
had
not
quite
abandoned
them
.
<EOS>
But
,
now
I
believe
that
the
mark
of
the
red
cross
is
fatal
to
them
,
and
that
they
have
no
part
in
His
mercies
.
 
<EOS>
And
them
and
their
descendants
,
to
the
last
of
their
race
,
I
,
Alexandre
Manette
,
unhappy
prisoner
,
do
this
last
night
of
the
year
1767
,
in
my
unbearable
agony
,
denounce
to
the
times
when
all
these
things
shall
be
answered
for
.
<EOS>
I
denounce
them
to
Heaven
and
to
earth
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
terrible
sound
arose
when
the
reading
of
this
document
was
done
.
<EOS>
A
sound
of
craving
and
eagerness
that
had
nothing
articulate
in
it
but
blood
.
 
<EOS>
The
narrative
called
up
the
most
revengeful
passions
of
the
time
,
and
there
was
not
a
head
in
the
nation
but
must
have
dropped
before
it
.
   
<EOS>
Little
need
,
in
presence
of
that
tribunal
and
that
auditory
,
to
&
<EOS>
how
how
the
Defarges
had
not
made
the
paper
public
,
with
the
other
captured
Bastille
memorials
borne
in
procession
,
and
had
kept
it
,
biding
their
time
.
 
<EOS>
Little
need
to
show
that
this
detested
family
name
had
long
been
anathematised
by
Saint
Antoine
,
and
was
wrought
into
the
fatal
register
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
never
trod
ground
whose
virtues
and
services
would
have
sustained
him
in
that
place
that
day
,
against
such
denunciation
.
   
<EOS>
And
all
the
worse
for
the
doomed
man
,
that
the
denouncer
was
a
well
-
known
citizen
,
his
own
attached
friend
,
the
father
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
frenzied
aspirations
of
the
populace
was
,
for
imitations
of
the
questionable
public
virtues
of
antiquity
,
and
for
sacrifices
and
self
-
immolations
on
the
people
's
altar
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
when
the
President
said
(
else
had
his
own
head
quivered
on
his
shoulders
)
,
that
the
good
physician
of
the
Republic
would
deserve
better
still
of
the
Republic
by
rooting
out
an
obnoxious
family
of
Aristocrats
,
and
would
doubtless
feel
a
sacred
glow
and
joy
in
making
his
daughter
a
widow
and
her
child
an
orphan
,
there
was
wild
excitement
,
patriotic
fervour
,
not
a
touch
of
human
sympathy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Much
influence
around
him

has
that
Doctor

murmured
Madame
Defarge
,
smiling
to
The
Vengeance

"
Save
him
now

my
Doctor

save
him

At
every
juryman

there
was
a
roar

Another

another

<EOS>
Roar
and
roar

Unanimously
voted

Dusk
 
<EOS>
The
wretched
wife
of
the
innocent
man
thus
doomed
to
die
,
fell
under
the
sentence
,
as
if
she
had
been
mortally
stricken
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
she
uttered
no
sound
;
and
so
strong
was
the
voice
within
her
,
representing
that
it
was
she
of
all
the
world
who
must
uphold
him
in
his
misery
and
not
augment
it
,
that
it
quickly
raised
her
,
even
from
that
shock
.
   
<EOS>
The
Judges
having
to
take
part
in
a
public
demonstration
out
of
doors
,
the
Tribunal
adjourned
.
 
<EOS>
The
quick
noise
and
movement
of
the
court
's
emptying
itself
by
many
passages
had
not
ceased
,
when
Lucie
stood
stretching
out
her
arms
towards
her
husband
,
with
nothing
in
her
face
but
love
and
consolation
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
might
touch
him
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
might
embrace
him
once
!
 
<EOS>
O
,
good
citizens
,
if
you
would
have
so
much
compassion
for
us
!
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
but
a
gaoler
left
,
along
with
two
of
the
four
men
who
had
taken
him
last
night
,
and
Barsad
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
had
all
poured
out
to
the
show
in
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
Barsad
proposed
to
the
rest
,
"
Let
her
embrace
him
then
;
it
is
but
a
moment
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
silently
acquiesced
in
,
and
they
passed
her
over
the
seats
in
the
hall
to
a
raised
place
,
where
he
,
by
leaning
over
the
dock
,
could
fold
her
in
his
arms
.
   
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
dear
darling
of
my
soul
.
 
<EOS>
My
parting
blessing
on
my
love
.
<EOS>
We
shall
meet
again
,
where
the
weary
are
at
rest
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
were
her
husband
's
words
,
as
he
held
her
to
his
bosom
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
bear
it
,
dear
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
supported
from
above
:
 
<EOS>
do
n't
suffer
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
A
parting
blessing
for
our
chad
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
send
it
to
her
by
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
kiss
her
by
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
farewell
to
her
by
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
husband
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
A
moment
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
tearing
himself
apart
from
her
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
be
separated
long
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
this
will
break
my
heart
by
-
and
-
bye
;
but
I
will
do
my
duty
while
I
can
,
and
when
I
leave
her
,
God
will
raise
up
friends
for
her
,
as
He
did
for
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
father
had
followed
her
,
and
would
have
fallen
on
his
knees
to
both
of
them
,
but
that
Darnay
put
out
a
hand
and
seized
him
,
crying
:
   
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
What
have
you
done
,
what
have
you
done
,
that
you
should
kneel
to
us
!
 
<EOS>
We
know
now
,
what
a
struggle
you
made
of
old
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
,
now
what
you
underwent
when
you
suspected
my
descent
,
and
when
you
knew
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
now
,
the
natural
antipathy
you
strove
against
,
and
conquered
,
for
her
dear
sake
.
 
<EOS>
We
thank
you
with
all
our
hearts
,
and
all
our
love
and
duty
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
be
with
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
father
's
only
answer
was
to
draw
his
hands
through
his
white
hair
,
and
wring
them
with
a
shriek
of
anguish
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
could
not
be
otherwise
,
"
said
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
things
have
worked
together
as
they
have
fallen
out
.
<EOS>
it
was
the
always
-
vain
endeavour
to
discharge
my
poor
mother
's
trust
that
first
brought
my
fatal
presence
near
you
.
 
<EOS>
Good
could
never
come
of
such
evil
,
a
happier
end
was
not
in
nature
to
so
unhappy
a
beginning
.
 
<EOS>
Be
comforted
,
and
forgive
me
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
bless
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
was
drawn
away
,
his
wife
released
him
,
and
stood
looking
after
him
with
her
hands
touching
one
another
in
the
attitude
of
prayer
,
and
with
a
radiant
look
upon
her
face
,
in
which
there
was
even
a
comforting
smile
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
went
out
at
the
prisoners
'
door
,
she
turned
,
laid
her
head
lovingly
on
her
father
's
breast
,
tried
to
speak
to
him
,
and
fell
at
his
feet
.
   
<EOS>
Then
,
issuing
from
the
obscure
corner
from
which
he
had
never
moved
,
Sydney
Carton
came
and
took
her
up
.
 
<EOS>
Only
her
father
and
Mr
Lorry
were
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
His
arm
trembled
as
it
raised
her
,
and
supported
her
head
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
there
was
an
air
about
him
that
was
not
all
of
pity
<EOS>
---
that
had
a
flush
of
pride
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
take
her
to
a
coach
?
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
feel
her
weight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
carried
her
lightly
to
the
door
,
and
laid
her
tenderly
down
in
a
coach
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
and
their
old
friend
got
into
it
,
and
he
took
his
seat
beside
the
driver
.
   
<EOS>
When
they
arrived
at
the
gateway
where
he
had
paused
in
the
dark
not
many
hours
before
,
to
picture
to
himself
on
which
of
the
rough
stones
of
the
street
her
feet
had
trodden
,
he
lifted
her
again
,
and
carried
her
up
the
staircase
to
their
rooms
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
he
laid
her
down
on
a
couch
,
where
her
child
and
Miss
Pross
wept
over
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
recall
her
to
herself
,
"
he
said
,
softly
,
to
the
latter
,
"
she
is
better
so
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
revive
her
to
consciousness
,
while
she
only
faints
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Carton
,
Carton
,
dear
Carton
!
"
cried
little
Lucie
,
springing
up
and
throwing
her
arms
passionately
round
him
,
in
a
burst
of
grief
.
"
<EOS>
Now
that
you
have
come
,
I
think
you
will
do
something
to
help
mamma
,
something
to
save
papa
!
 
<EOS>
O
,
look
at
her
,
dear
Carton
!
 
<EOS>
Can
you
,
of
all
the
people
who
love
her
,
bear
to
see
her
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
bent
over
the
child
,
and
laid
her
blooming
cheek
against
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
put
her
gently
from
him
,
and
looked
at
her
unconscious
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
Before
I
go
,
"
he
said
,
and
paused
---
<EOS>
"
I
may
kiss
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
remembered
afterwards
that
when
he
bent
down
and
touched
her
face
with
his
lips
,
he
murmured
some
words
.
 
<EOS>
The
child
,
who
was
nearest
to
him
,
told
them
afterwards
,
and
told
her
grandchildren
when
she
was
a
handsome
old
lady
,
that
she
heard
him
say
,
"
A
life
you
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
When
he
had
gone
out
into
the
next
room
,
he
turned
suddenly
on
Mr
Lorry
and
her
father
,
who
were
following
,
and
said
to
the
latter
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
great
influence
but
yesterday
,
Doctor
Manette
;
let
it
at
least
be
tried
.
 
<EOS>
These
judges
,
and
all
the
men
in
power
,
are
very
friendly
to
you
,
and
very
recognisant
of
your
services
;
are
they
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
connected
with
Charles
was
concealed
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
the
strongest
assurances
that
I
should
save
him
;
and
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
returned
the
answer
in
great
trouble
,
and
very
slowly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Try
them
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
hours
between
this
and
to
-
morrow
afternoon
are
few
and
short
,
but
try
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
intend
to
try
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
rest
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
known
such
energy
as
yours
do
great
things
before
now
---
though
never
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
smile
and
a
sigh
together
,
"
such
great
things
as
this
.
 
<EOS>
But
try
!
 
<EOS>
Of
little
worth
as
life
is
<EOS>
when
we
misuse
it
,
it
is
worth
that
effort
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
cost
nothing
to
lay
down
if
it
were
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
,
"
said
Doctor
Manette
,
"
to
the
Prosecutor
and
the
President
<EOS>
straight
,
and
I
will
go
to
others
whom
it
is
better
not
to
name
.
<EOS>
I
will
write
too
,
and
---
But
stay
!
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
Celebration
in
the
streets
,
and
no
one
will
be
accessible
until
dark
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
forlorn
hope
at
the
best
,
and
not
much
the
forlorner
for
being
delayed
till
dark
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
know
how
you
speed
;
though
,
mind
!
 
<EOS>
I
expect
nothing
!
 
<EOS>
When
are
you
likely
to
have
seen
these
dread
powers
,
Doctor
Manette
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Immediately
after
dark
,
I
should
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Within
an
hour
or
two
from
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
dark
soon
after
four
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
stretch
the
hour
or
two
.
<EOS>
If
I
go
to
Mr
Lorry
's
at
nine
,
shall
I
hear
what
you
have
done
,
either
from
our
friend
or
from
yourself
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
May
you
prosper
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
followed
Sydney
to
the
outer
door
,
and
,
touching
him
on
the
shoulder
as
he
was
going
away
,
caused
him
to
turn
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
hope
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
in
a
low
and
sorrowful
whisper
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nor
have
I.
"
   
"
<EOS>
If
any
one
of
these
men
,
or
all
of
these
men
,
were
disposed
to
spare
him
---
which
is
a
large
supposition
;
for
what
is
his
life
,
or
any
man
's
to
them
!
<EOS>
---
I
doubt
if
they
durst
spare
him
after
the
demonstration
in
the
court
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
do
I.
I
heard
the
fall
of
the
axe
in
that
sound
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
leaned
his
arm
upon
the
door
-
post
,
and
bowed
his
face
upon
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
despond
,
"
said
Carton
,
very
gently
;
"
do
n't
grieve
.
<EOS>
I
encouraged
Doctor
Manette
in
this
idea
,
because
I
felt
that
it
might
one
day
be
consolatory
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
she
might
think
"
his
life
was
want
only
thrown
away
or
wasted
,
"
and
that
might
trouble
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
,
"
returned
Mr
Lorry
,
drying
his
eyes
,
"
you
are
right
.
<EOS>
But
he
will
perish
;
there
is
no
real
hope
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
perish
:
 
<EOS>
there
is
no
real
hope
,
"
echoed
Carton
.
   
<EOS>
And
walked
with
a
settled
step
,
down
-
stairs
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter

.
<EOS>
Darkness
 
<EOS>
Sydney
Carton
paused
in
the
street
,
not
quite
decided
where
to
go
.
"
<EOS>
At
Tellson
's
banking
-
house
at
nine
,
"
he
said
,
with
a
musing
face
.
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
do
well
,
in
the
mean
time
,
to
show
myself
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
It
is
best
that
these
people
should
know
there
is
such
a
man
as
I
here
;
it
is
a
sound
precaution
,
and
may
be
a
necessary
preparation
.
<EOS>
But
care
,
care
,
care
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
think
it
out
!
"
   
<EOS>
Checking
his
steps
which
had
begun
to
tend
towards
an
object
,
he
took
a
turn
or
two
in
the
already
darkening
street
,
and
traced
the
thought
in
his
mind
to
its
possible
consequences
.
 
<EOS>
His
first
impression
was
confirmed
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
best
,
"
he
said
,
finally
resolved
,
"
that
these
people
should
know
there
is
such
a
man
as
I
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
turned
his
face
towards
Saint
Antoine
.
   
<EOS>
Defarge
had
described
himself
,
that
day
,
as
the
keeper
of
a
wine
-
shop
in
the
Saint
Antoine
suburb
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
difficult
for
one
who
knew
the
city
well
,
to
find
his
house
without
asking
any
question
.
 
<EOS>
Having
ascertained
its
situation
,
Carton
came
out
of
those
closer
streets
again
,
and
dined
at
a
place
of
refreshment
and
fell
sound
asleep
after
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
in
many
years
,
he
had
no
strong
drink
.
<EOS>
Since
last
night
he
had
taken
nothing
but
a
little
light
thin
wine
,
and
last
night
he
had
dropped
the
brandy
slowly
down
on
Mr
Lorry
's
hearth
like
a
man
who
had
done
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
as
late
as
seven
o'clock
when
he
awoke
refreshed
,
and
went
out
into
the
streets
again
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
passed
along
towards
Saint
Antoine
,
he
stopped
at
a
shop
-
window
where
there
was
a
mirror
,
and
slightly
altered
the
disordered
arrangement
of
his
loose
cravat
,
and
his
coat
-
collar
,
and
his
wild
hair
.
 
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
went
on
direct
to
Defarge
's
,
and
went
in
.
   
<EOS>
There
happened
to
be
no
customer
in
the
shop
but
<EOS>
Jacques
Three
,
of
the
restless
fingers
and
the
croaking
voice
.
 
<EOS>
This
man
,
whom
he
had
seen
upon
the
Jury
,
stood
drinking
at
the
little
counter
,
in
conversation
with
the
Defarges
,
man
and
wife
.
 
<EOS>
The
Vengeance
assisted
in
the
conversation
,
like
a
regular
member
of
the
establishment
.
   
<EOS>
As
Carton
walked
in
,
took
his
seat
and
asked
(
in
very
indifferent
French
)
for
a
small
measure
of
wine
,
Madame
Defarge
cast
a
careless
glance
at
him
,
and
then
a
keener
,
and
then
a
keener
,
and
then
advanced
to
him
herself
,
and
asked
him
what
it
was
he
had
ordered
.
   
<EOS>
He
repeated
what
he
had
already
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
English
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Madame
Defarge
,
inquisitively
raising
her
dark
eyebrows
.
   
<EOS>
After
looking
at
her
,
as
if
the
sound
of
even
a
single
French
word
were
slow
to
express
itself
to
him
,
he
answered
,
in
his
former
strong
foreign
accent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
madame
,
yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
English
!
"
   
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
returned
to
her
counter
to
get
the
wine
,
and
,
as
he
took
up
a
Jacobin
journal
and
feigned
to
pore
over
it
puzzling
out
its
meaning
,
he
heard
her
say
,
"
I
swear
to
you
,
like
Evremonde
!
"
   
<EOS>
Defarge
brought
him
the
wine
,
and
gave
him
Good
Evening
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
evening
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Good
evening
,
citizen
,
"
filling
his
glass
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
and
good
wine
.
<EOS>
I
drink
to
the
Republic
.
"
   
<EOS>
Defarge
went
back
to
the
counter
,
and
said
,
"
<EOS>
Certainly
,
a
little
like
.
"
 
<EOS>
Madame
sternly
retorted
,
"
I
tell
you
a
good
deal
like
.
"
<EOS>
Jacques
Three
pacifically
remarked
,
"
He
is
so
much
in
your
mind
,
see
you
,
madame
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
amiable
Vengeance
added
,
with
a

Yes
,
my
faith

And
you
are
looking
forward
with
so
much
pleasure
to
seeing
him
once
more
to
-
morrow

"
   
<EOS>
Carton
followed
the
lines
and
words
of
his
paper
,
with
a
slow
forefinger
,
and
with
a
studious
and
absorbed
face
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
all
leaning
their
arms
on
the
counter
close
together
,
speaking
low
.
<EOS>
After
a
silence
of
a
few
moments
,
during
which
they
all
looked
towards
him
without
disturbing
his
outward
attention
from
the
Jacobin
editor
,
they
resumed
their
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
what
madame
says
,
"
observed
Jacques
Three
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
stop
?
<EOS>
There
is
great
force
in
that
.
 
<EOS>
Why
stop
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
reasoned
Defarge
,
"
but
one
must
stop
somewhere
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
the
question
is
still
where
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
extermination
,
"
said
madame
.
   
<EOS>
"
Magnificent
!
"
croaked
Jacques
Three
.
 
<EOS>
The
Vengeance
,
also
,
highly
approved
.
   
<EOS>
"
Extermination
is
good
doctrine
,
my
wife
,
"
said
Defarge
,
rather
troubled
;
"
in
general
,
I
say
nothing
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
Doctor
has
suffered
much
;
you
have
seen
him
to
-
day
;
you
have
observed
his
face
when
the
paper
was
read
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
observed
his
face
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
madame
,
contemptuously
and
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
observed
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
observed
his
face
to
be
not
the
face
of
a
true
friend
of
the
Republic
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
take
care
of
his
face
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
observed
,
my
wife
,
"
said
Defarge
,
in
a
deprecatory
manner
,
"
the
anguish
of
his
daughter
,
which
must
be
a
dreadful
anguish
to
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
observed
his
daughter
,
"
repeated
madame
;
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
have
observed
his
daughter
,
more
times
than
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
observed
her
to
-
day
,
and
I
have
observed
her
other
days
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
observed
her
in
the
court
,
and
I
have
observed
her
in
the
street
by
the
prison
.
<EOS>
Let
me
but
lift
my
finger
---
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
raise
it
(
the
listener
's
eyes
were
always
on
his
paper
)
,
and
to
let
it
fall
with
a
rattle
on
the
ledge
before
her
,
as
if
the
axe
had
dropped
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
citizeness
is
superb
!
"
croaked
the
Juryman
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
an
Angel
!
"
said
The
Vengeance
,
and
embraced
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
thee
,
"
pursued
madame
,
implacably
,
addressing
her
husband
,
"
if
it
depended
on
thee
---
which
,
happily
,
it
does
not
---
thou
wouldst
rescue
this
man
even
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
protested
Defarge
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
if
to
lift
this
glass
would
do
it
!
<EOS>
But
I
would
leave
the
matter
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
stop
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
See
you
then
,
Jacques
,
"
said
Madame
Defarge
,
wrathfully
;
"
and
see
you
,
too
,
my
little
Vengeance

see
you
both
!
 
<EOS>
Listen
!
 
<EOS>
For
other
crimes
as
tyrants
and
oppressors
,
I
have
this
race
a
long
time
on
my
register
,
doomed
to
destruction
and
extermination
.
 
<EOS>
Ask
my
husband
,
is
that
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
,
"
assented
Defarge
,
without
being
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
beginning
of
the
great
days
,
when
the
Bastille
falls
,
he
finds
this
paper
of
to
-
day
,
and
he
brings
it
home
,
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
when
this
place
is
clear
and
shut
,
we
read
it
,
here
on
this
spot
,
by
the
light
of
this
lamp
.
 
<EOS>
Ask
him
,
is
that
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
,
"
assented
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
night
,
I
tell
him
,
when
the
paper
is
read
through
,
and
the
lamp
is
burnt
out
,
and
the
day
is
gleaming
in
above
those
shutters
and
between
those
iron
bars
,
that
I
have
now
a
secret
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
Ask
him
,
is
that
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
,
"
assented
Defarge
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
communicate
to
him
that
secret
.
 
<EOS>
I
smite
this
bosom
with
these
two
hands
as
I
smite
it
now
,
and
I
tell
him
,
"
Defarge
,
I
was
brought
up
among
the
fishermen
of
the
sea
-
shore
,
and
that
peasant
family
so
injured
by
the
two
Evremonde
brothers
,
as
that
Bastille
paper
describes
,
is
my
family
.
 
<EOS>
Defarge
,
<EOS>
that
sister
of
the
mortally
wounded
boy
upon
the
ground
was
my
sister
,
that
husband
was
my
sister
's
husband
,
that
unborn
child
was
their
child
,
that
brother
was
my
brother
,
that
father
was
my
father
,
those
dead
are
my
dead
,
and
that
summons
to
answer
for
those
things
descends
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
Ask
him
,
is
that
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
,
"
assented
Defarge
once
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
tell
Wind
and
Fire
where
to
stop
,
"
returned
madame
;
"
but
do
n't
tell
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Both
her
hearers
derived
a
horrible
enjoyment
from
the
deadly
nature
of
her
wrath
---
the
listener
could
feel
how
white
she
was
,
without
seeing
her
---
and
both
highly
commended
it
.
 
<EOS>
Defarge
,
a
weak
minority
,
interposed
a
few
words
for
the
memory
of
the
compassionate
wife
of
the
Marquis
;
but
only
elicited
from
his
own
wife
a
repetition
of
her
last
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
the
Wind
and
the
Fire
where
to
stop
;
not
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Customers
entered
,
and
the
group
was
broken
up
.
 
<EOS>
The
English
customer
paid
for
what
he
had
had
,
perplexedly
counted
his
change
,
and
asked
,
as
a
stranger
,
to
be
directed
towards
the
National
Palace
.
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
took
him
to
the
door
,
and
put
her
arm
on
his
,
in
pointing
out
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
The
English
customer
was
not
without
his
reflections
then
,
that
it
might
be
a
good
deed
to
seize
that
arm
,
lift
it
,
and
strike
under
it
sharp
and
deep
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
he
went
his
way
,
and
was
soon
swallowed
up
in
the
shadow
of
the
prison
wan
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
appointed
hour
,
he
emerged
from
it
to
present
himself
in
Mr
Lorry
's
room
again
,
where
he
found
the
old
gentleman
walking
to
and
fro
in
restless
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
had
been
with
Lucie
until
just
now
,
and
had
only
left
her
for
a
few
minutes
,
to
come
and
keep
his
appointment
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
had
not
been
seen
,
since
he
quitted
the
banking
-
house
towards
four
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
some
faint
hopes
that
his
mediation
might
save
Charles
,
but
they
were
very
slight
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
more
than
five
hours
gone
:
 
where
could
he
be
?
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
waited
until
ten
;
but
,
Doctor
Manette
not
returning
,
and
he
being
unwilling
to
leave
Lucie
any
longer
,
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
go
back
to
her
,
and
come
to
the
banking
-
house
again
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
,
Carton
would
wait
alone
by
the
fire
for
the
Doctor
.
   
<EOS>
He
waited
and
waited
,
and
the
clock
struck
twelve
;
but
Doctor
Manette
did
not
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
returned
,
and
found
no
tidings
of
him
,
and
brought
none
.
 
<EOS>
Where
could
he
be
?
   
<EOS>
They
were
discussing
this
question
,
and
were
almost
building
up
some
weak
structure
of
hope
on
his
prolonged
absence
,
when
they
heard
him
on
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
The
instant
he
entered
the
room
<EOS>
,
it
was
plain
that
all
was
lost
.
   
<EOS>
Whether
he
had
really
been
to
any
one
,
or
whether
be
had
been
all
that
time
traversing
the
streets
,
was
never
known
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
stood
staring
at
them
,
they
asked
him
no
question
,
for
his
face
told
them
everything
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
find
it
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
must
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
Where
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
His
head
and
throat
were
bare
,
and
,
as
he
spoke
with
a
helpless
look
straying
all
around
,
he
took
his
coat
off
,
and
let
it
drop
on
the
floor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
is
my
bench
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
looking
everywhere
for
my
bench
,
and
I
ca
n't
find
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
have
they
done
with
my
work
?
 
<EOS>
Time
presses
:
I
must
finish
those
shoes
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
looked
at
one
another
,
and
their
hearts
died
within
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
in
a
whimpering
miserable
way
;
"
let
me
get
to
work
.
<EOS>
Give
me
my
work
.
"
   
<EOS>
Receiving
no
answer
,
he
tore
his
hair
,
and
beat
his
feet
upon
the
ground
,
like
a
distracted
child
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
torture
a
poor
forlorn
wretch
,
"
he
implored
them
,
with
a
dreadful
cry
;
"
but
give
me
my
work
!
 
<EOS>
What
is
to
become
of
us
,
if
those
shoes
are
not
done
to
-
night
?
"
   
<EOS>
Lost
,
utterly
lost
!
   
<EOS>
It
was
so
clearly
beyond
hope
to
reason
with
him
,
or
try
to
restore
him
,
that
---
as
if
by
agreement
---
they
each
put
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
soothed
him
to
sit
down
before
the
fire
,
with
a
promise
that
he
should
have
his
work
presently
.
 
<EOS>
He
sank
into
the
chair
,
and
brooded
over
the
embers
,
and
shed
tears
.
 
<EOS>
As
if
all
that
had
happened
since
the
garret
time
were
a
momentary
fancy
,
or
a
dream
,
Mr
Lorry
saw
him
shrink
into
the
exact
figure
that
Defarge
had
had
in
keeping
.
   
<EOS>
Affected
,
and
impressed
with
terror
as
they
both
were
,
by
this
spectacle
of
ruin
<EOS>
,
it
was
not
a
time
to
yield
to
such
emotions
.
<EOS>
His
lonely
daughter
,
bereft
of
her
final
hope
and
reliance
,
appealed
to
them
both
too
strongly
.
<EOS>
Again
,
as
if
by
agreement
,
they
looked
at
one
another
with
one
meaning
in
their
faces
.
<EOS>
Carton
was
the
first
to
speak
:
   
<EOS>
"
The
last
chance
is
gone
:
 
it
was
not
much
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
;
he
had
better
be
taken
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
before
you
go
,
will
you
,
for
a
moment
,
steadily
attend
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
ask
me
why
I
make
the
stipulations
I
am
going
to
make
,
and
exact
the
promise
I
am
going
to
exact
;
I
have
a
reason
---
a
good
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
doubt
it
,
"
answered
Mr
Lorry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Say
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
figure
in
the
chair
between
them
,
was
all
the
time
monotonously
rocking
itself
to
and
fro
,
and
moaning
.
 
<EOS>
They
spoke
in
such
a
tone
as
they
would
have
used
if
they
had
been
watching
by
a
sick
-
bed
in
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
Carton
stooped
to
pick
up
the
coat
,
which
lay
almost
entangling
his
feet
.
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
,
a
small
case
in
which
the
Doctor
was
accustomed
to
carry
the
lists
of
his
day
's
duties
,
fen
lightly
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Carton
took
it
up
,
and
there
was
a
folded
paper
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
should
look
at
this
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
nodded
his
consent
.
 
<EOS>
He
opened
it
,
and
exclaimed
,
"
Thank
GOD
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
asked
Mr
Lorry
,
eagerly
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
moment
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
speak
of
it
in
its
place
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
"
he
put
his
hand
in
his
coat
,
and
took
another
paper
from
it
,
"
that
is
the
certificate
which
enables
me
to
pass
out
of
this
city
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
---
<EOS>
Sydney
Carton
,
an
Englishman
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
held
it
open
in
his
hand
,
gazing
in
his
earnest
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Keep
it
for
me
until
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
see
him
to
-
morrow
,
you
remember
,
and
I
had
better
not
take
it
into
the
prison
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
;
I
prefer
not
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
take
this
paper
that
Doctor
Manette
has
carried
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
similar
certificate
,
enabling
him
and
his
daughter
and
her
child
,
at
any
time
,
to
pass
the
barrier
and
the
frontier
!
 
<EOS>
You
see
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
obtained
it
as
his
last
and
utmost
precaution
against
evil
,
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
When
is
it
dated
?
 
<EOS>
But
no
matter
;
do
n't
stay
to
look
;
put
it
up
carefully
with
mine
and
your
own
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
observe
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
doubted
until
within
this
hour
or
two
,
that
he
had
,
or
could
have
such
a
paper
.
<EOS>
It
is
good
,
until
recalled
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
may
be
soon
recalled
,
and
,
I
have
reason
to
think
,
will
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
are
not
in
danger
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
are
in
great
danger
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
in
danger
of
denunciation
by
Madame
Defarge
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
from
her
own
lips
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
overheard
words
of
that
woman
's
,
to
-
night
,
which
have
presented
their
danger
to
me
in
strong
colours
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
lost
no
time
,
and
since
then
,
I
have
seen
the
spy
.
<EOS>
He
confirms
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
knows
that
a
wood
-
sawyer
,
living
by
the
prison
wall
,
is
under
the
control
of
the
Defarges
,
and
has
been
rehearsed
by
Madame
Defarge
as
to
his
having
seen
Her
"
---
he
never
mentioned
Lucie
's
name
---
"
making
signs
and
signals
to
prisoners
.
<EOS>
It
is
easy
to
foresee
that
the
pretence
will
be
the
common
one
,
a
prison
plot
,
and
that
it
will
involve
her
life
---
and
perhaps
her
child
's
---
and
perhaps
her
father
's
---
for
both
have
been
seen
with
her
at
that
place
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
look
so
horrified
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
save
them
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Heaven
grant
<EOS>
I
may
,
Carton
!
 
<EOS>
But
how
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
tell
you
how
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
depend
on
you
,
and
it
could
depend
on
no
better
man
.
 
<EOS>
This
new
denunciation
will
certainly
not
take
place
until
after
to
-
morrow
;
probably
not
until
two
or
three
days
afterwards
;
more
probably
a
week
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
it
is
a
capital
crime
,
to
mourn
for
,
or
sympathise
with
,
a
victim
of
the
Guillotine
.
 
<EOS>
She
and
her
father
would
unquestionably
be
guilty
of
this
crime
,
and
this
woman
(
the
inveteracy
of
whose
pursuit
can
not
be
described
)
would
wait
to
add
that
strength
to
her
case
,
and
make
herself
doubly
sure
.
<EOS>
You
follow
me
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
attentively
,
and
with
so
much
confidence
in
what
you
say
,
that
for
the
moment
I
lose
sight
,
"
touching
the
back
of
the
Doctor
's
chair
,
even
of
this
distress
.
"
   
"
You
have
money
,
and
can
buy
the
means
of
travelling
to
the
seacoast
as
quickly
as
the
journey
can
be
made
.
 
<EOS>
Your
preparations
have
been
completed
for
some
days
,
to
return
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
Early
to
-
morrow
have
your
horses
ready
,
so
that
they
may
be
in
starting
trim
at
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
done
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
manner
was
so
fervent
and
inspiring
,
that
Mr
Lorry
caught
the
flame
,
and
was
as
quick
as
youth
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
noble
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
say
we
could
depend
upon
no
better
man
?
<EOS>
Tell
her
,
to
-
night
,
what
you
know
of
her
danger
as
involving
her
child
and
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
Dwell
upon
that
,
for
she
would
lay
her
own
fair
head
beside
her
husband
's
cheerfully
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
faltered
for
an
instant
;
then
went
on
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
the
sake
of
her
child
and
her
father
,
press
upon
her
the
necessity
of
leaving
Paris
,
with
them
and
you
,
at
that
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
her
that
it
was
her
husband
's
last
arrangement
.
<EOS>
Tell
her
that
more
depends
upon
it
than
she
dare
believe
,
or
hope
.
<EOS>
You
think
that
her
father
,
even
in
this
sad
state
,
will
submit
himself
to
her
;
do
you
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
so
.
 
<EOS>
Quietly
and
steadily
have
all
these
arrangements
made
in
the
courtyard
here
,
even
to
the
taking
of
your
own
seat
in
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
The
moment
I
come
to
you
,
take
me
in
,
and
drive
away
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
understand
that
I
wait
for
you
under
all
circumstances

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
my
certificate
in
your
hand
with
the
rest
,
you
know
,
and
will
reserve
my
place
.
 
<EOS>
Wait
for
nothing
but
to
have
my
place
occupied
,
and
then
for
England
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
,
"
said
Mr
Lorry
,
grasping
his
eager
but
so
firm
and
steady
hand
,
"
it
does
not
all
depend
on
one
old
man
,
but
I
shall
have
a
young
and
ardent
man
at
my
side
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
the
help
of
Heaven
you
shall
!
 
<EOS>
Promise
me
solemnly
that
nothing
will
influence
you
to
alter
the
course
on
which
we
now
stand
pledged
to
one
another

"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
Carton
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Remember
these
words
to
-
morrow
:
 
<EOS>
change
the
course
,
or
delay
in
it
---
for
any
reason
---
and
no
life
can
possibly
be
saved
,
and
many
lives
must
inevitably
be
sacrificed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
remember
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
to
do
my
part
faithfully
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
hope
to
do
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
good
bye
!
"
   
<EOS>
Though
he
said
it
with
a
grave
smile
of
earnestness
,
and
though
he
even
put
the
old
man
's
hand
to
his
lips
,
he
did
not
part
from
him
then
.
<EOS>
He
helped
him
so
far
to
arouse
the
rocking
figure
before
the
dying
embers
,
as
to
get
a
cloak
and
hat
put
upon
it
,
and
to
tempt
it
forth
to
find
where
the
bench
and
work
were
hidden
that
it
still
moaningly
besought
to
have
.
 
<EOS>
He
walked
on
the
other
side
of
it
and
protected
it
to
the
courtyard
of
the
house
where
the
afflicted
heart
---
so
happy
in
the
memorable
time
when
he
had
revealed
his
own
desolate
heart
to
it
---
outwatched
the
awful
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
entered
the
courtyard
and
remained
there
for
a
few
moments
alone
,
looking
up
at
the
light
in
the
window
of
her
room
.
 
<EOS>
Before
he
went
away
,
he
breathed
a
blessing
towards
it
,
and
a
Farewell
.

Chapter
13
.
<EOS>
Fifty
-
two
 
<EOS>
In
the
black
prison
of
the
Conciergerie
,
the
doomed
of
the
day
awaited
their
fate
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
in
number
as
the
weeks
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
Fifty
-
two
were
to
roll
that
afternoon
on
the
life
-
tide
of
the
city
to
the
boundless
everlasting
sea
.
 
<EOS>
Before
their
cells
were
quit
of
them
,
new
occupants
were
appointed
;
before
their
blood
ran
into
the
blood
spilled
yesterday
,
the
blood
that
was
to
mingle
with
theirs
to
-
morrow
was
already
set
apart
.
   
<EOS>
Two
score
and
twelve
were
told
off
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
farmer
-
general
of
seventy
,
whose
riches
could
not
buy
his
life
,
to
the
seamstress
of
twenty
,
whose
poverty
and
obscurity
could
not
save
her
.
 
<EOS>
Physical
diseases
,
engendered
in
the
vices
and
neglects
of
men
,
will
seize
on
victims
of
all
degrees
;
and
the
frightful
moral
disorder
,
born
of
unspeakable
suffering
,
intolerable
oppression
,
and
heartless
indifference
,
smote
equally
without
distinction
.
   
<EOS>
Charles
Darnay
,
alone
in
a
cell
,
had
sustained
himself
with
no
flattering
delusion
since
he
came
to
it
from
the
Tribunal
.
<EOS>
In
every
line
of
the
narrative
he
had
heard
,
he
had
heard
his
condemnation
.
<EOS>
He
had
fully
comprehended
that
no
personal
influence
could
possibly
save
him
,
that
he
was
virtually
sentenced
by
the
millions
,
and
that
units
could
avail
him
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
it
was
not
easy
,
with
the
face
of
his
beloved
wife
fresh
before
him
,
to
compose
his
mind
to
what
it
must
bear
.
 
<EOS>
His
hold
on
life
was
strong
,
and
it
was
very
,
very
hard
,
to
loosen
;
by
gradual
efforts
and
degrees
unclosed
a
little
here
,
it
clenched
the
tighter
there
;
and
when
he
brought
his
strength
to
bear
on
that
hand
<EOS>
and
it
yielded
,
this
was
closed
again
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
hurry
,
too
,
in
all
his
thoughts
,
a
turbulent
and
heated
working
of
his
heart
,
that
contended
against
resignation
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
for
a
moment
,
he
did
feel
resigned
,
then
his
wife
and
child
who
had
to
live
after
him
,
seemed
to
protest
and
to
make
it
a
selfish
thing
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
all
this
was
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
Before
long
,
the
consideration
that
there
was
no
disgrace
in
the
fate
he
must
meet
,
and
that
numbers
went
the
same
road
wrongfully
,
and
trod
it
firmly
every
day
,
sprang
up
to
stimulate
him
.
 
<EOS>
Next
followed
the
thought
that
much
of
the
future
peace
of
mind
enjoyable
by
the
dear
ones
,
depended
on
his
quiet
fortitude
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
by
degrees
he
calmed
into
the
better
state
,
when
he
could
raise
his
thoughts
much
higher
,
and
draw
comfort
down
.
   
<EOS>
Before
it
had
set
in
dark
on
the
night
of
his
condemnation
,
he
had
travelled
thus
far
on
his
last
way
.
 
<EOS>
Being
allowed
to
purchase
the
means
of
writing
,
and
a
light
,
he
sat
down
to
write
until
such
time
as
the
prison
lamps
should
be
extinguished
.
   
<EOS>
He
wrote
a
long
letter
to
Lucie
,
showing
her
that
he
had
known
nothing
of
her
father
's
imprisonment
,
until
he
had
heard
of
it
from
herself
,
and
that
he
had
been
as
ignorant
as
she
of
his
father
's
and
uncle
's
responsibility
for
that
misery
,
until
the
paper
had
been
read
.
<EOS>
He
had
already
explained
to
her
that
his
concealment
from
herself
of
the
name
he
had
relinquished
,
was
the
one
condition
---
fully
intelligible
now
---
that
her
father
had
attached
to
their
betrothal
,
and
was
the
one
promise
he
had
still
exacted
on
the
morning
of
their
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
He
entreated
her
,
for
her
father
's
sake
,
never
to
seek
to
know
whether
her
father
had
become
oblivious
of
the
existence
of
the
paper
,
or
had
had
it
recalled
to
him
(
for
the
moment
,
or
for
good
)
,
by
the
story
of
the
Tower
,
on
that
old
Sunday
under
the
dear
old
plane
-
tree
in
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
preserved
any
definite
remembrance
of
it
,
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
he
had
supposed
it
destroyed
with
the
Bastille
,
when
he
had
found
no
mention
of
it
among
the
relics
of
prisoners
which
the
populace
had
discovered
there
,
and
which
had
been
described
to
all
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
He
besought
her
---
though
he
added
that
he
knew
it
was
needless
---
to
console
her
father
,
by
impressing
him
through
every
tender
<EOS>
means
she
could
think
of
,
with
the
truth
that
he
had
done
nothing
for
which
he
could
justly
reproach
himself
,
but
had
uniformly
forgotten
himself
for
their
joint
sakes
.
 
<EOS>
Next
to
her
preservation
of
his
own
last
grateful
love
and
blessing
,
and
her
overcoming
of
her
sorrow
,
to
devote
herself
to
their
dear
child
,
he
adjured
her
,
as
they
would
meet
in
Heaven
,
to
comfort
her
father
.
   
<EOS>
To
her
father
himself
,
he
wrote
in
the
same
strain
;
but
,
he
told
her
father
that
he
expressly
confided
his
wife
and
child
to
his
care
.
<EOS>
And
he
told
him
this
,
very
strongly
,
with
the
hope
of
rousing
him
from
any
despondency
or
dangerous
retrospect
towards
which
he
foresaw
he
might
be
tending
.
   
<EOS>
To
Mr
Lorry
,
he
commended
them
all
,
and
explained
his
worldly
affairs
.
<EOS>
That
done
,
with
many
added
sentences
of
grateful
friendship
and
warm
attachment
,
all
was
done
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
thought
of
Carton
.
 
<EOS>
His
mind
was
so
full
of
the
others
,
that
he
never
once
thought
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
time
to
finish
these
letters
before
the
lights
were
put
out
.
<EOS>
When
he
lay
down
on
his
straw
bed
,
he
thought
he
had
done
with
this
world
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
it
beckoned
him
back
in
his
sleep
,
and
showed
itself
in
shining
forms
.
 
<EOS>
Free
and
happy
<EOS>
,
back
in
the
old
house
in
Soho
(
though
it
had
nothing
in
it
like
the
real
house
)
,
unaccountably
released
and
light
of
heart
,
he
was
with
Lucie
again
,
and
she
told
him
it
was
all
a
dream
,
and
he
had
never
gone
away
.
 
<EOS>
A
pause
of
forgetfulness
,
and
then
he
had
even
suffered
,
and
had
come
back
to
her
,
dead
and
at
peace
,
and
yet
there
was
no
difference
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
Another
pause
of
oblivion
,
and
he
awoke
in
the
sombre
morning
,
unconscious
where
he
was
or
what
had
happened
,
until
it
flashed
upon
his
mind
,
"
this
is
the
day
of
my
death
!
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
,
had
he
come
through
the
hours
,
to
the
day
when
the
fifty
-
two
heads
were
to
fall
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
while
he
was
composed
,
and
hoped
that
he
could
meet
the
end
with
quiet
heroism
,
a
new
action
began
in
his
waking
thoughts
,
which
was
very
difficult
to
master
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
never
seen
the
instrument
that
was
to
terminate
his
life
.
<EOS>
How
high
it
was
from
the
ground
,
how
many
steps
it
had
,
where
he
would
be
stood
,
bow
he
would
be
touched
,
whether
the
touching
hands
would
be
dyed
red
,
which
way
his
face
would
be
turned
,
whether
he
would
be
the
first
,
or
might
be
the
last
:
 
these
and
many
similar
questions
,
in
nowise
directed
by
his
will
,
obtruded
themselves
over
and
over
again
,
countless
times
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
were
they
connected
with
fear
:
 
<EOS>
he
was
conscious
of
no
fear
.
 
<EOS>
Rather
,
they
originated
in
a
strange
besetting
desire
to
know
what
to
do
when
the
time
came
;
a
desire
gigantically
disproportionate
to
the
few
swift
moments
to
which
it
referred
;
a
wondering
that
was
more
like
the
wondering
of
some
other
spirit
within
his
,
than
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
The
hours
went
on
as
he
walked
to
and
fro
,
and
the
clocks
struck
the
numbers
he
would
never
hear
again
.
 
<EOS>
Nine
gone
for
ever
<EOS>
,
ten
gone
for
ever
,
eleven
gone
for
ever
,
twelve
coming
on
to
pass
away
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
hard
contest
with
that
eccentric
action
of
thought
which
had
last
perplexed
him
,
he
had
got
the
better
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
walked
up
and
down
,
softly
repeating
their
names
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
The
worst
of
the
strife
was
over
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
walk
up
and
down
,
free
from
distracting
fancies
,
praying
for
himself
and
for
them
.
   
<EOS>
Twelve
gone
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
been
apprised
that
the
final
hour
was
Three
,
and
be
knew
he
would
be
summoned
some
time
earlier
,
inasmuch
as
the
tumbrils
jolted
heavily
and
slowly
through
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
he
resolved
to
keep
Two
before
his
mind
,
as
the
hour
,
and
so
to
strengthen
himself
in
the
interval
that
he
might
be
able
,
after
that
time
,
to
strengthen
others
.
   
<EOS>
Walking
regularly
to
and
fro
with
his
arms
folded
on
his
breast
,
a
very
different
man
from
the
prisoner
,
who
had
walked
to
and
fro
at
La
Force
,
he
heard
One
struck
away
from
him
,
without
surprise
.
<EOS>
The
hour
had
measured
like
most
other
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Devoutly
thankful
to
Heaven
for
his
recovered
self
-
possession
,
he
thought
,
"
There
is
but
another
now
,
"
and
turned
to
walk
again
.
   
<EOS>
Footsteps
in
the
stone
passage
outside
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
The
key
was
put
in
the
lock
,
and
turned
.
 
<EOS>
Before
the
door
was
opened
,
or
as
it
opened
,
a
man
said
in
a
low
voice
,
in
English
:
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
never
seen
me
here
;
I
have
kept
out
of
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
Go
you
in
alone
;
I
wait
near
.
<EOS>
Lose
no
time
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
door
was
quickly
opened
and
closed
,
and
there
stood
before
him
face
to
face
,
quiet
,
intent
upon
him
,
with
the
light
of
a
smile
on
his
features
,
and
a
cautionary
finger
on
his
lip
,
Sydney
Carton
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
bright
and
remarkable
in
his
look
,
that
,
for
the
first
moment
,
the
prisoner
misdoubted
him
to
be
an
apparition
of
his
own
imagining
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
he
spoke
,
and
it
was
his
voice
;
he
took
the
prisoner
's
hand
,
and
it
was
his
real
grasp
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
all
the
people
upon
earth
,
you
least
expected
to
see
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
be
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
believe
it
to
be
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
scarcely
believe
it
now
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
"
---
the
apprehension
came
suddenly
into
his
mind
---
"
a
prisoner
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
accidentally
possessed
of
a
power
over
one
of
the
keepers
here
,
and
in
virtue
of
it
I
stand
before
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
from
her
---
your
wife
,
dear
Darnay
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
prisoner
wrung
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
bring
you
a
request
from
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
most
earnest
,
pressing
,
and
emphatic
entreaty
,
addressed
to
you
in
the
most
pathetic
tones
of
the
voice
so
dear
to
you
,
that
you
well
remember
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
prisoner
turned
his
face
partly
aside
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
time
to
ask
me
why
I
bring
it
,
or
what
it
means
;
I
have
no
time
to
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
comply
with
it
---
take
off
those
boots
you
wear
,
and
draw
on
these
of
mine
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
chair
against
the
wall
of
the
cell
,
behind
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Carton
,
pressing
forward
,
had
already
,
with
the
speed
of
lightning
,
got
him
down
into
it
,
and
stood
over
him
,
barefoot
.
   
<EOS>
"
Draw
on
these
boots
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Put
your
hands
to
them
;
put
your
will
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Quick
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Carton
,
there
is
no
escaping
from
this
place
;
it
never
can
be
done
.
<EOS>
You
will
only
die
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
madness
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
madness
if
I
asked
you
to
escape
;
but
do
I
?
 
<EOS>
When
I
ask
you
to
pass
out
at
that
door
,
tell
me
it
is
madness
and
remain
here
.
<EOS>
Change
that
cravat
for
this
of
mine
,
that
coat
for
this
of
mine
.
<EOS>
While
you
do
it
,
let
me
take
this
ribbon
from
your
hair
,
and
shake
out
your
hair
like
this
of
mine
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
wonderful
quickness
,
and
with
a
strength
both
of
will
and
action
,
that
appeared
quite
supernatural
,
he
forced
all
these
changes
upon
him
.
<EOS>
The
prisoner
was
like
a
young
child
in
his
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
Carton
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
Carton
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
madness
.
 
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
accomplished
,
it
never
can
be
done
,
it
has
been
attempted
,
and
has
always
failed
.
<EOS>
I
implore
you
not
to
add
your
death
to
the
bitterness
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
I
ask
you
,
my
dear
Darnay
,
to
pass
the
door
?
 
<EOS>
When
I
ask
that
,
refuse
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
pen
and
ink
and
paper
on
this
table

<EOS>
Is
your
hand
steady
enough
to
write
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
when
you
came
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Steady
it
again
,
and
write
what
I
shall
dictate
.
 
<EOS>
Quick
,
friend
,
quick
!
"
   
<EOS>
Pressing
his
hand
to
his
bewildered
head
,
Darnay
sat
down
at
the
table
.
<EOS>
Carton
,
with
his
right
hand
in
his
breast
,
stood
close
beside
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Write
exactly
as
I
speak
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
whom
do
I
address
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
no
one
.
"
 
<EOS>
Carton
still
had
his
hand
in
his
breast
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
I
date
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
prisoner
looked
up
,
at
each
question
.
 
<EOS>
Carton
,
standing
over
him
with
his
hand
in
his
breast
,
looked
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
If
you
remember
,
"
"
said
Carton
,
dictating
,
"
"
the
words
that
passed
between
us
,
long
ago
,
you
will
readily
comprehend
this
when
you
see
it
.
<EOS>
You
do
remember
them
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
in
your
nature
to
forget
them
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
drawing
his
hand
from
his
breast
;
the
prisoner
chancing
to
look
up
in
his
hurried
wonder
as
he
wrote
,
the
hand
stopped
,
closing
upon
something
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
written
"
forget
them
'
?
"
<EOS>
Carton
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
Is
that
a
weapon
in
your
hand
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
am
not
armed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
in
your
hand
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
know
directly
.
 
<EOS>
Write
on
<EOS>
;
there
are
but
a
few
words
more
.
"
<EOS>
He
dictated
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
"
I
am
thankful
that
the
time
has
come
,
when
I
can
prove
them
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
do
so
is
no
subject
for
regret
or
grief
.
"
<EOS>
"
As
he
said
these
words
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
writer
,
his
hand
slowly
and
softly
moved
down
close
to
the
writer
's
face
.
   
<EOS>
The
pen
dropped
from
Darnay
's
fingers
on
the
table
,
and
he
looked
about
him
vacantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
vapour
is
that
?
"
he
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Vapour
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Something
that
crossed
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
conscious
of
nothing
;
there
can
be
nothing
here
.
 
<EOS>
Take
up
the
pen
and
finish
.
 
<EOS>
Hurry
,
hurry
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
if
his
memory
were
impaired
,
or
his
faculties
disordered
,
the
prisoner
made
an
effort
to
rally
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
looked
at
Carton
with
clouded
eyes
and
with
an
altered
manner
of
breathing
,
Carton
---
his
hand
again
in
his
breast
---
looked
steadily
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hurry
,
hurry
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
prisoner
bent
over
the
paper
,
once
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
If
it
had
been
otherwise
;
"
"
Carton
's
hand
was
again
watchfully
and
softly
stealing
down
;
"
"
I
never
should
have
used
the
longer
opportunity
.
<EOS>
If
it
had
been
otherwise
;
"
"
the
hand
was
at
the
prisoner
's
face
;
"
"
I
should
but
have
had
so
much
the
more
to
answer
for
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
had
been
otherwise
---
"
"
Carton
looked
at
the
pen
and
saw
it
was
trailing
off
into
unintelligible
signs
.
   
<EOS>
Carton
's
hand
moved
back
to
his
breast
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
The
prisoner
sprang
up
with
a
reproachful
look
,
but
Carton
's
hand
was
close
and
firm
at
his
nostrils
,
and
Carton
's
left
arm
caught
him
round
the
waist
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
seconds
he
faintly
struggled
with
the
man
who
had
come
to
lay
down
his
life
for
him
;
but
,
within
a
minute
or
so
,
he
was
stretched
insensible
on
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
Quickly
,
but
with
hands
as
true
to
the
purpose
as
his
heart
was
,
Carton
dressed
himself
in
the
clothes
the
prisoner
bad
laid
aside
,
combed
back
his
hair
,
and
tied
it
with
the
ribbon
the
prisoner
had
worn
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
softly
called
,
"
Enter
there
!
 
<EOS>
Come
in
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
Spy
presented
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
?
"
said
Carton
,
looking
up
,
as
he
kneeled
on
one
knee
beside
the
insensible
figure
,
putting
the
paper
in
the
breast
:
 
<EOS>
"
is
your
hazard
very
great
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Carton
,
"
the
Spy
answered
,
with
a
timid
snap
of
his
fingers
,
"
my
hazard
is
not
THAT
,
in
the
thick
of
business
here
,
if
you
are
true
to
the
whole
of
your
bargain
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
fear
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
be
true
to
the
death
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
,
Mr
Carton
,
if
the
tale
of
fifty
-
two
is
to
be
right
.
<EOS>
Being
made
right
by
you
in
that
dress
,
I
shall
have
no
fear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
no
fear
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
soon
be
out
of
the
way
of
harming
you
,
and
the
rest
will
soon
be
far
from
here
,
please
God
!
 
<EOS>
Now
,
get
assistance
and
take
me
to
the
coach
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
?
"
said
the
Spy
nervously
.
   
<EOS>
"
Him
,
man
,
with
whom
I
have
exchanged
.
 
<EOS>
You
go
out
at
the
gate
by
which
you
brought
me
in
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
.
"
   
"
I
was
weak
and
faint
when
you
brought
me
in
,
and
I
am
fainter
now
you
take
me
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
parting
interview
has
overpowered
me
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
thing
has
happened
here
,
often
,
and
too
often
.
 
<EOS>
Your
life
is
in
your
own
hands
.
<EOS>
Quick
!
 
<EOS>
Call
assistance
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
swear
not
to
betray
me
?
"
said
the
trembling
Spy
,
as
he
paused
for
a
last
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Man
,
man
!
<EOS>
"
returned
Carton
,
stamping
his
foot
;
"
have
I
sworn
by
no
solemn
vow
already
,
to
go
through
with
this
,
that
you
waste
the
precious
moments
now
?
 
<EOS>
Take
him
yourself
to
the
courtyard
you
know
of
,
place
him
yourself
in
the
carriage
,
show
him
yourself
to
Mr
Lorry
,
tell
him
yourself
to
give
him
no
restorative
but
air
,
and
to
remember
my
words
of
last
night
,
and
his
promise
of
last
night
,
and
drive
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
Spy
withdrew
,
and
Carton
seated
himself
at
the
table
,
resting
his
forehead
on
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
The
Spy
returned
immediately
,
with
two
men
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
,
then
?
"
said
one
of
them
,
contemplating
the
fallen
figure
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
afflicted
to
find
that
his
friend
has
drawn
a
prize
in
the
lottery
of
Sainte
Guillotine
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
good
patriot
,
"
said
the
other
,
"
could
hardly
have
been
more
afflicted
if
the
Aristocrat
had
drawn
a
blank
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
raised
the
unconscious
figure
,
placed
it
on
a
litter
they
had
brought
to
the
door
,
and
bent
to
carry
it
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
time
is
short
,
Evremonde
,
"
said
the
Spy
,
in
a
warning
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
well
,
"
answered
Carton
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
careful
of
my
friend
,
I
entreat
you
,
and
leave
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
then
,
my
children
,
"
said
Barsad
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lift
him
,
and
come
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
door
closed
,
and
Carton
was
left
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Straining
his
powers
of
listening
to
the
utmost
,
he
listened
for
any
sound
that
might
denote
suspicion
or
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
none
.
 
<EOS>
Keys
turned
,
doors
clashed
,
footsteps
passed
along
distant
passages
:
 
no
cry
was
raised
,
or
hurry
made
,
that
seemed
unusual
.
 
<EOS>
Breathing
more
freely
in
a
little
while
,
he
sat
down
at
the
table
,
and
listened
again
until
the
clock
struck
Two
.
   
<EOS>
Sounds
that
he
was
not
afraid
of
,
for
he
divined
their
meaning
,
then
began
to
be
audible
.
 
<EOS>
Several
doors
were
opened
in
succession
,
and
finally
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
A
gaoler
,
with
a
list
in
his
hand
,
looked
in
,
merely
saying
,
"
Follow
me
,
Evremonde
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
followed
into
a
large
dark
room
,
at
a
distance
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
dark
winter
day
,
and
what
with
the
shadows
within
,
and
what
with
the
shadows
without
,
he
could
but
dimly
discern
the
others
who
were
brought
there
to
have
their
arms
bound
.
 
<EOS>
Some
were
standing
;
some

<EOS>
Some
were
lamenting
,
and
in
restless
motion
;
but
,
these
were
few
.
<EOS>
The
great
majority
were
silent
and
still
,
looking
fixedly
at
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
stood
by
the
wall
in
a
dim
corner
,
while
some
of
the
fifty
-
two
were
brought
in
after
him
,
one
man
stopped
in
passing
,
to
embrace
him
,
as
having
a
knowledge
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
thrilled
him
with
a
great
dread
of
discovery
;
but
the
man
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
A
very
few
moments
after
that
,
a
young
woman
,
with
a
slight
girlish
form
,
a
sweet
spare
face
in
which
there
was
no
vestige
of
colour
,
and
large
widely
opened
patient
eyes
,
rose
from
the
seat
where
he
had
observed
her
sitting
,
and
came
to
speak
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Citizen
Evremonde
,
"
she
said
,
touching
him
with
her
cold
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
poor
little
seamstress
,
who
was
with
you
in
La
Force
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
murmured
for
answer
:
 
<EOS>
"
True
.
 
<EOS>
I
forget
what
you
were
accused
of
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Plots
.
 
<EOS>
Though
the
just
Heaven
knows
that
I
am
innocent
of
any
.
<EOS>
Is
it
likely
?
 
<EOS>
Who
would
think
of
plotting
with
a
poor
little
weak
creature
like
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
forlorn
smile
with
which
she
said
it
,
so
touched
him
,
that
tears
started
from
his
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
afraid
to
die
,
Citizen
Evremonde
,
but
I
have
done
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
unwilling
to
die
,
if
the
Republic
which
is
to
do
so
much
good
to
us
poor
,
will
profit
by
my
death
;
but
I
do
not
know
how
that
can
be
,
Citizen
Evremonde
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
poor
weak
little
creature
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
last
thing
on
earth
that
his
heart
was
to
warm
and
soften
to
,
it
warmed
and
softened
to
this
pitiable
girl
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
heard
you
were
released
,
Citizen
Evremonde

<EOS>
I
hoped
it
was
true
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
I
was
again
taken
and
condemned

<EOS>
"
If
I
may
ride
with
you
,
Citizen
Evremonde

will
you
let
me
hold
your
hand

<EOS>
I
am
not
afraid
,
but
I
am
little
and
weak
,
and
it
will
give
me
more
courage
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
patient
eyes
were
lifted
to
his
face
,
he
saw
a
sudden
doubt
in
them
,
and
then
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
He
pressed
the
work
-
worn
,
hunger
-
worn
young
fingers
,
and
touched
his
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
dying
for
him
?
"
<EOS>
she
whispered
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
his
wife
and
child
.
 
<EOS>
Hush

<EOS>
Yes

<EOS>
"
O
you
will
let

<EOS>

The

falling

alighted

stands
with

replying

They
leisurely
walk
round

leisurely
mount
the

to
look
at
what
little

it
carries
on
the

the

hanging
about

press
nearer

greedily
stare

the

open

avenues

The
hard
uneven
pavement
is
under

the

on

Sometimes

we
strike
into
the

clatter
us

shake
us

sometimes

we
stick

Leisurely
,
our
four
horses
are
taken
out
;
leisurely
,
the
coach
stands
in
the
little
street
,
bereft
of
horses
,
and
with
no
likelihood
upon
it
of
ever
moving
again
;
leisurely
,
the
new
horses
come
into
visible
existence
,
one
by
one
;
leisurely
,
the
new
postilions
follow
,
sucking
and
plaiting
the
lashes
of
their
whips
;
leisurely
,
the
old
postilions
count
their
money
,
make
wrong
additions
,
and
arrive
at
dissatisfied
results
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
time
,
our
overfraught
hearts
are
beating
at
a
rate
that
would
far
outstrip
the
fastest
gallop
of
the
fastest
horses
ever
foaled

<EOS>
At
length
the
new

are
in

the

are
left
behind

We
are
through

up
the

down
the
hill

on

low

Suddenly
,
the
postilions
exchange
speech
with
animated

the

pulled
up

The
Knitting

<EOS>
In
that
same
juncture
of
time
when
the
Fifty
-
Two
awaited
their
fate
Madame
Defarge
held
darkly
ominous
council
with
The
Vengeance
and
Jacques
Three
of
the
Revolutionary
Jury
.
 
<EOS>
Not
in

shop
did
Madame

confer
with

ministers
,

in
the
shed
of
the
wood
-
sawyer
,
erst
a
mender
of
roads

<EOS>
The
sawyer
himself
did
not
participate
in

conference

abided
at
a
little
distance
,
like
an
outer
satellite
who
was
not

or
to
offer
an
opinion
until
invited

But

well

But
my

his
weaknesses

relent

<EOS>
"
It

dubiously

cruel
fingers
at

mouth

That
must
never
be
,
"
croaked
Jacques
Three
;
"
no
one
must
escape
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
half
enough
as
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
We
ought
to
have
six
score
a
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
a
word
,
"
Madame
Defarge
went
on
,
"
my
husband
has
not
my
reason
for
pursuing
this
family
to
annihilation
,
and
I
have
not
his
reason
for
regarding
this
Doctor
with
any
sensibility
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
act
for
myself
,
therefore
.
 
<EOS>
Come
hither
,
little
citizen
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
wood
-
sawyer
,
who
held
her
in
the
respect
,
and
himself
in
the
submission
,
of
mortal
fear
,
advanced
with
his
hand
to
his
red
cap
.
   
<EOS>
"
Touching
those
signals
,
little
citizen
,
"
said
Madame
Defarge
,
sternly
,
"
that
she
made
to
the
prisoners
;
you
are
ready
to
bear
witness
to
them
this
very
day
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
why
not
!
"
cried
the
sawyer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Every
day
,
in
all
weathers
,
from
two
to
four
,
always
signalling
,
sometimes
with
the
little
one
,
sometimes
without
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
with
my
eyes
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
made
all
manner
of
gestures
while
he
spoke
,
as
if
in
incidental
imitation
of
some
few
of
the
great
diversity
of
signals
that
he
had
never
seen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Clearly
plots
,
"
said
Jacques
Three
.
 
<EOS>
"
Transparently
!
"
   
"
There
is
no
doubt
of
the
Jury
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Madame
Defarge
,
letting
her
eyes
turn
to
him
with
a
gloomy
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rely
upon
the
patriotic
Jury
,
dear
citizeness
.
 
<EOS>
I
answer
for
my
fellow
-
Jurymen
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
let
me
see
,
"
said
Madame
Defarge
,
pondering
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yet
once
more
!
<EOS>
Can
I
spare
this
Doctor
to
my
husband
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
feeling
either
way
.
<EOS>
Can
I
spare
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
would
count
as
one
head
,
"
observed
Jacques
Three
,
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
We
really
have
not
heads
enough
;
it
would
be
a
pity
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
signalling
with
her
when
I
saw
her
,
"
argued
Madame
Defarge
;
"
I
can
not
speak
of
one
without
the
other
;
and
I
must
not
be
silent
,
and
trust
the
case
wholly
to
him
,
this
little
citizen
here
.
<EOS>
For
,
I
am
not
a
bad
witness
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Vengeance
and
Jacques
Three
vied
with
each
other
in
their
fervent
protestations
that
she
was
the
most
admirable
and
marvellous
of
witnesses
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
citizen
,
not
to
be
outdone
,
declared
her
to
be
a
celestial
witness
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
must
take
his
chance
,
"
said
Madame
Defarge
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
can
not
spare
him
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
engaged
at
three
o'clock
;
you
are
going
to
see
the
batch
of
to
-
day
executed
.
<EOS>
---
You
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
question
was
addressed
to
the
wood
-
sawyer
,
who
hurriedly
replied
in
the
affirmative
:
 
seizing
the
occasion
to
add
that
he
was
the
most
ardent
of
Republicans
,
and
that
he
would
be
in
effect
the
most
desolate
of
Republicans
,
if
anything
prevented
him
from
enjoying
the
pleasure
of
smoking
his
afternoon
pipe
in
the
contemplation
of
the
droll
national
barber
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
very
demonstrative
herein
,
that
he
might
have
been
suspected
(
<EOS>
perhaps
was
,
by
the
dark
eyes
that
looked
contemptuously
at
him
out
of
Madame
Defarge
's
head
)
of
having
his
small
individual
fears
for
his
own
personal
safety
,
every
hour
in
the
day
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
,
"
said
madame
,
"
am
equally
engaged
at
the
same
place
.
 
<EOS>
After
it
is
over
-
say
at
eight
to
-
night
---
come
you
to
me
,
in
Saint
Antoine
,
and
we
will
give
information
against
these
people
at
my
Section
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
wood
-
sawyer
said
he
would
be
proud
and
flattered
to
attend
the
citizeness
.
 
<EOS>
The
citizeness
looking
at
him
<EOS>
,
he
became
embarrassed
,
evaded
her
glance
as
a
small
dog
would
have
done
,
retreated
among
his
wood
,
and
hid
his
confusion
over
the
handle
of
his
saw
.
   
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
beckoned
the
Juryman
and
The
Vengeance
a
little
nearer
to
the
door
,
and
there
expounded
her
further
views
to
them
thus
:
   
"
She
will
now
be
at
home
,
awaiting
the
moment
of
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
be
mourning
and
grieving
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
be
in
a
state
of
mind
to
impeach
the
justice
of
the
Republic
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
be
full
of
sympathy
with
its
enemies
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
to
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
an
admirable
woman
;
what
an
adorable
woman
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Jacques
Three
,
rapturously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
my
cherished
!
"
<EOS>
cried
The
Vengeance
;
and
embraced
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
you
my
knitting
,
"
said
Madame
Defarge
,
placing
it
in
her
lieutenant
's
hands
,
"
and
have
it
ready
for
me
in
my
usual
seat
.
<EOS>
Keep
me
my
usual
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Go
you
there
,
straight
,
for
there
will
probably
be
a
greater
concourse
than
usual
,
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
willingly
obey
the
orders
of
my
Chief
,
"
said
The
Vengeance
with
alacrity
,
and
kissing
her
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
be
late
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
there
before
the
commencement
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
before
the
tumbrils
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
Be
sure
you
are
there
,
my
soul
,
"
said
The
Vengeance
,
calling
after
her
,
<EOS>
for
she
had
already
turned
into
the
street
,
"
before
the
tumbrils
arrive
!
"
   
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
slightly
waved
her
hand
,
to
imply
that
she
heard
,
and
might
be
relied
upon
to
arrive
in
good
time
,
and
so
went
through
the
mud
,
and
round
the
corner
of
the
prison
wall
.
 
<EOS>
The
Vengeance
and
the
Juryman
,
looking
after
her
as
she
walked
away
,
were
highly
appreciative
of
her
fine
figure
,
and
her
superb
moral
endowments
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
many
women
at
that
time
,
upon
whom
the
time
laid
a
dreadfully
disfiguring
hand
;
but
,
there
was
not
one
among
them
more
to
be
dreaded
than
this
ruthless
woman
,
now
taking
her
way
along
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
Of
a
strong
and
fearless
character
,
of
shrewd
sense
and
readiness
,
of
great
determination
,
of
that
kind
of
beauty
which
not
only
seems
to
impart
to
its
possessor
firmness
and
animosity
,
but
to
strike
into
others
an
instinctive
recognition
of
those
qualities
;
the
troubled
time
would
have
heaved
her
up
,
under
any
circumstances
.
<EOS>
But
,
imbued
from
her
childhood
with
a
brooding
sense
of
wrong
,
and
an
inveterate
hatred
of
a
class
,
opportunity
had
developed
her
into
a
tigress
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
absolutely
without
pity
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
had
ever
had
the
virtue
in
her
,
it
had
quite
gone
out
of
her
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
nothing
to
her
,
that
an
innocent
man
was
to
die
for
the
sins
of
his
forefathers
;
she
saw
,
not
him
,
but
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
nothing
to
her
,
that
his
wife
was
to
be
made
a
widow
and
his
daughter
an
orphan
;
that
was
insufficient
punishment
,
because
they
were
her
natural
enemies
and
her
prey
,
and
as
such
had
no
right
to
live
.
 
<EOS>
To
appeal
to
her
,
was
made
hopeless
by
her
having
no
sense
of
pity
,
even
for
herself
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
been
laid
low
in
the
streets
,
in
any
of
the
many
encounters
in
which
she
had
been
engaged
,
she
would
not
have
pitied
herself
;
nor
,
if
she
had
been
ordered
to
the
axe
to
-
morrow
,
would
she
have
gone
to
it
with
any
softer
feeling
than
a
fierce
desire
to
change
places
with
the
man
who
sent
here
there
.
   
<EOS>
Such
a
heart
Madame
Defarge
carried
under
her
rough
robe
.
 
<EOS>
Carelessly
worn
,
it
was
a
becoming
robe
enough
,
in
a
certain
weird
way
,
and
her
dark
hair
looked
rich
under
her
coarse
red
cap
.
 
<EOS>
Lying
hidden
in
her
bosom
,
was
a
loaded
pistol
.
 
<EOS>
Lying
hidden
at
her
waist
,
was
a
sharpened
dagger
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
accoutred
,
and
walking
with
the
confident
tread
of
such
a
character
,
and
with
the
supple
freedom
of
a
woman
who
had
habitually
walked
in
her
girlhood
,
bare
-
foot
and
bare
-
legged
,
on
the
brown
sea
-
sand
,
Madame
Defarge
took
her
way
along
the
streets
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
when
the
journey
of
the
travelling
coach
,
at
that
very
moment
waiting
for
the
completion
of
its
load
,
had
been
planned
out
last
night
,
the
difficulty
of
taking
Miss
Pross
in
it
had
much
engaged
Mr
Lorry
's
attention
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
merely
desirable
to
avoid
overloading
the
coach
,
but
it
was
of
the
highest
importance
that
the
time
occupied
in
examining
it
and
its
passengers
,
should
be
reduced
to
the
utmost
;
since
their
escape
might
depend
on
the
saving
of
only
a
few
seconds
here
and
there
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
he
had
proposed
,
after
anxious
   
consideration
,
that
Miss
Pross
and
Jerry
,
who
were
at
liberty
to
leave
the
city
,
should
leave
it
at
three
o'clock
in
the
lightest
-
wheeled
conveyance
known
to
that
period
.
 
<EOS>
Unencumbered
with
luggage
,
they
would
soon
overtake
the
coach
,
and
,
passing
it
and
preceding
it
on
the
road
,
would
order
its
horses
in
advance
,
and
greatly
facilitate
its
progress
during
the
precious
hours
of
the
night
,
when
delay
was
the
most
to
be
dreaded
.
   
<EOS>
Seeing
in
this
arrangement
the
hope
of
rendering
real
service
in
that
pressing
emergency
,
Miss
Pross
hailed
it
with
joy
.
 
<EOS>
She
and
Jerry
had
beheld
the
coach
start
,
had
known
who
it
was
that
Solomon
brought
,
<EOS>
had
passed
some
ten
minutes
in
tortures
of
suspense
,
and
were
now
concluding
their
arrangements
to
follow
the
coach
,
even
as
Madame
Defarge
,
taking
her
way
through
the
streets
,
now
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
else
-
deserted
lodging
in
which
they
held
their
consultation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
what
do
you
think
,
Mr
Cruncher
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
whose
agitation
was
so
great
that
she
could
hardly
speak
,
or
stand
,
or
move
,
or
live
:
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
of
our
not
starting
from
this
courtyard
?
 
<EOS>
Another
carriage
having
already
gone
from
here
to
-
day
,
it
might
awaken
suspicion
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
opinion
,
miss
,
"
returned
Mr
Cruncher
,
"
is
as
you
're
right
.
<EOS>
Likewise
wot
<EOS>
I
'll
stand
by
you
,
right
or
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
distracted
with
fear
and
hope
for
our
precious
creatures
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
wildly
crying
,
"
that
I
am
incapable
of
forming
any
plan
.
<EOS>
Are
YOU
capable
of
forming
any
plan
,
my
dear
good
Mr
Cruncher
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Respectin
'
a
future
spear
o
'
life
,
miss
,
"
returned
Mr
Cruncher
,
"
I
hope
so
.
 
<EOS>
Respectin
'
any
present
use
o
'
<EOS>
this
here
blessed
old
head
o
'
mind
,
I
think
not
.
 
<EOS>
Would
you
do
me
the
favour
,
miss
,
to
take
notice
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
two
promises
and
wows
<EOS>
wot
<EOS>
it
is
my
wishes
fur
to
record
in
this
here
crisis
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
for
gracious
sake
!
"
cried
Miss
Pross
,
still
wildly
crying
,
"
record
them
at
once
,
and
get
them
out
of
the
way
,
like
an
excellent
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
First
,
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
,
who
was
all
in
a
tremble
,
and
who
spoke
with
an
ashy
and
solemn
visage
,
"
them
poor
things
<EOS>
well
out
o
'
<EOS>
this
,
never
no
more
will
I
do
it
,
never
no
more
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
sure
,
Mr
Cruncher
,
"
returned
Miss
Pross
,
"
that
you
never
will
do
it
again
,
whatever
it
is
,
and
I
beg
you
not
to
think
it
necessary
to
mention
more
particularly
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
miss
,
"
returned
Jerry
,
"
it
shall
not
be
named
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Second
:
them
<EOS>
poor
things
<EOS>
well
out
<EOS>
o
'
this
,
and
never
no
more
<EOS>
will
I
interfere
with
Mrs
Cruncher
's
flopping
,
never
no
more
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Whatever
housekeeping
arrangement
that
may
be
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
striving
to
dry
her
eyes
and
compose
herself
,
"
I
have
no
doubt
it
is
best
that
Mrs
Cruncher
should
have
it
entirely
under
her
own
superintendence
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
O
my
poor
darlings
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
go
so
far
as
to
say
,
miss
,
moreover
,
"
proceeded
Mr
Cruncher
,
with
a
most
alarming
tendency
to
hold
forth
as
from
a
pulpit
---
"
and
let
my
words
be
took
down
and
took
to
Mrs
Cruncher
through
yourself
---
that
wot
my
opinions
<EOS>
respectin
'
flopping
has
undergone
a
change
,
and
that
wot
<EOS>
I
only
hope
with
all
my
heart
as
Mrs
Cruncher
may
be
a
flopping
at
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
there
,
there
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
she
is
,
my
dear
man
,
"
cried
the
distracted
Miss
Pross
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
hope
she
finds
it
answering
her
expectations
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Forbid
it
,
"
proceeded
Mr
Cruncher
,
with
additional
solemnity
,
additional
slowness
,
and
additional
tendency
to
hold
forth
and
hold
out
,
"
as
anything
wot
<EOS>
I
have
ever
said
or
done
should
be
wisited
on
my
earnest
wishes
for
them
poor
creeturs
now

<EOS>
This
was
Mr
Cruncher
's
conclusion
after
a
protracted
but
vain
endeavour
to
find
a
better
one
.
   
<EOS>
And
still
Madame
Defarge
,
pursuing
her
way
along
the
streets
,
came
nearer
and
nearer
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
we
ever
get
back
to
our
native
land
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
"
you
may
rely
upon
my
telling
Mrs
Cruncher
as
much
as
I
may
be
able
to
remember
and
understand
of
what
you
have
so
impressively
said
;
and
at
all
events
you
may
be
sure
that
I
shall
bear
witness
to
your
being
thoroughly
in
earnest
at
this
dreadful
time
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
pray
let
us
think
!
<EOS>
My
esteemed
Mr
Cruncher
,
let
us
think
!
"
   
<EOS>
Still
,
Madame
Defarge
,
pursuing
her
way
along
the
streets
,
came
nearer
and
nearer
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
to
go
before
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
"
and
stop
the
vehicle
and
horses
from
coming
here
,
and
were
to
wait
somewhere
for
me
;
would
n't
that
be
best
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
thought
it
might
be
best
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
could
you
wait
for
me
?
"
asked
Miss
Pross
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
was
so
bewildered
that
he
could
think
of
no
locality
but
Temple
Bar
.
 
<EOS>
Alas
!
 
<EOS>
Temple
Bar
was
hundreds
of
miles
away
,
and
Madame
Defarge
was
drawing
very
near
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
the
cathedral
door
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
it
be
much
out
of
the
way
,
to
take
me
in
,
near
the
great
cathedral
door
between
the
two
towers
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
miss
,
"
answered
Mr
Cruncher
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
like
the
best
of
men
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
"
go
to
the
posting
-
house
straight
,
and
make
that
change
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
doubtful
,
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
,
hesitating
and
shaking
his
head
,
"
about
leaving
of
you
,
you
see
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
n't
know
what
may
happen
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Heaven
knows
we
do
n't
,
"
returned
Miss
Pross
,
"
but
have
no
fear
for
me
.
<EOS>
Take
me
in
at
the
cathedral
,
at
Three
o'Clock
,
or
as
near
it
as
you
can
,
and
I
am
sure
it
will
be
better
than
our
going
from
here
.
<EOS>
I
feel
certain
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
!
 
<EOS>
Bless
you
,
Mr
Cruncher
!
 
<EOS>
Think
-
not
of
me
,
but
of
the
lives
that
may
depend
on
both
of
us
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
exordium
,
and
Miss
Pross
's
two
hands
in
quite
agonised
entreaty
clasping
his
,
decided
Mr
Cruncher
.
 
<EOS>
With
an
encouraging
nod
or
two
,
he
immediately
went
out
to
alter
the
arrangements
,
and
left
her
by
herself
to
follow
as
she
had
proposed
.
   
<EOS>
The
having
originated
a
precaution
which
was
already
in
course
of
execution
,
was
a
great
relief
to
Miss
Pross
.
 
<EOS>
The
necessity
of
composing
her
appearance
so
that
it
should
attract
no
special
notice
in
the
streets
,
was
another
relief
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
at
her
watch
,
and
it
was
twenty
minutes
past
two
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
no
time
to
lose
,
but
must
get
ready
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
Afraid
,
in
her
extreme
perturbation
,
of
the
loneliness
of
the
deserted
rooms
,
and
of
half
-
imagined
faces
peeping
from
behind
every
open
door
in
them
<EOS>
,
Miss
Pross
got
a
basin
of
cold
water
and
began
laving
her
eyes
,
which
were
swollen
and
red
.
 
<EOS>
Haunted
by
her
feverish
apprehensions
,
she
could
not
bear
to
have
her
sight
obscured
for
a
minute
at
a
time
by
the
dripping
water
,
but
constantly
paused
and
looked
round
to
see
that
there
was
no
one
watching
her
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
of
those
pauses
she
recoiled
and
cried
out
,
for
she
saw
a
figure
standing
in
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
The
basin
fell
to
the
ground
broken
,
and
the
water
flowed
to
the
feet
of
Madame
Defarge
.
 
<EOS>
By
strange
stem
ways
,
and
through
much
staining
blood
,
those
feet
had
come
to
meet
that
water
.
   
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
looked
coldly
at
her
,
and
said
,
"
The
wife
of
Evremonde
;
where
is
she
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
flashed
upon
Miss
Pross
's
mind
that
the
doors
were
all
standing
open
,
and
would
suggest
the
flight
.
 
<EOS>
Her
first
act
was
to
shut
them
.
<EOS>
There
were
four
in
the
room
,
and
she
shut
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
placed
herself
before
the
door
of
the
chamber
which
Lucie
had
occupied
.
   
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
's
dark
eyes
followed
her
through
this
rapid
movement
,
and
rested
on
her
when
it
was
finished
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pross
had
nothing
beautiful
about
her
;
years
had
not
tamed
the
wildness
,
or
softened
the
grimness
,
of
her
appearance
;
but
,
she
too
was
a
determined
woman
in
her
different
way
,
and
she
measured
Madame
Defarge
with
her
eyes
,
every
inch
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
might
,
from
your
appearance
,
be
the
wife
of
Lucifer
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
in
her
breathing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nevertheless
,
you
shall
not
get
the
better
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
an
Englishwoman
.
"
   
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
looked
at
her
scornfully
,
but
still
with
something
of
Miss
Pross
's
own
perception
that
they
two
were
at
bay
.
 
<EOS>
She
saw
a
tight
,
hard
,
wiry
woman
before
her
,
as
Mr
Lorry
had
seen
in
the
same
figure
a
woman
with
a
strong
hand
,
in
the
years
gone
by
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
full
well
that
Miss
Pross
was
the
family
's
devoted
friend
;
Miss
Pross
knew
full
well
that
Madame
Defarge
was
the
family
's
malevolent
enemy
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
my
way
yonder
,
"
said
Madame
Defarge
,
with
a
slight
movement
of
her
hand
towards
the
fatal
spot
,
"
where
they
reserve
my
chair
and
my
knitting
for
me
,
I
am
come
to
make
my
compliments
to
her
in
passing
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
see
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
your
intentions
are
evil
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
"
and
you
may
depend
upon
it
<EOS>
,
I
'll
hold
my
own
against
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
Each
spoke
in
her
own
language
;
neither
understood
the
other
's
words
;
both
were
very
watchful
,
and
intent
to
deduce
from
look
and
manner
,
what
the
unintelligible
words
meant
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
will
do
her
no
good
to
keep
herself
concealed
from
me
at
this
moment
,
"
said
Madame
Defarge
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
patriots
will
know
what
that
means
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
Go
tell
her
that
I
wish
to
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
those
eyes
of
yours
were
bed
-
winches
,
"
returned
Miss
Pross
,
"
and
I
was
an
English
four
-
poster
<EOS>
,
they
should
n't
loose
a
splinter
of
me
.
<EOS>
No
,
you
wicked
foreign
woman
;
I
am
your
match
.
"
   
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
was
not
likely
to
follow
these
idiomatic
remarks
in
detail
;
but
,
she
so
far
understood
them
as
to
perceive
that
she
was
set
at
naught
.
   
<EOS>
"
Woman
imbecile
and
pig
-
like
!
<EOS>
"
said
Madame
Defarge
,
frowning
.
<EOS>
"
I
take
no
answer
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
demand
to
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
Either
tell
her
that
I
demand
to
see
her
,
or
stand
out
of
the
way
of
the
door
and
let
me
go
to
her
!
"
 
<EOS>
This
,
with
an
angry
explanatory
wave
of
her
right
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
little
thought
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
"
that
I
should
ever
want
to
understand
your
nonsensical
language
;
but
I
would
give
all
I
have
,
except
the
clothes
I
wear
,
to
know
whether
you
suspect
the
truth
,
or
any
part
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
for
a
single
moment
released
the
other
's
eyes
.
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
had
not
moved
from
the
spot
where
she
stood
when
Miss
Pross
first
became
aware
of
her
;
but
,
she
now
advanced
one
step
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
Briton
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
"
I
am
desperate
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
an
English
Twopence
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
the
longer
I
keep
you
here
,
the
greater
hope
there
is
for
my
Ladybird
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
not
leave
a
handful
of
that
dark
hair
upon
your
head
,
if
you
lay
a
finger
on
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
Miss
Pross
,
with
a
shake
of
her
head
and
a
flash
of
her
eyes
between
every
rapid
sentence
,
and
every
rapid
sentence
a
whole
breath
.
<EOS>
Thus
Miss
Pross
,
who
had
never
struck
a
blow
in
her
life
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
her
courage
was
of
that
emotional
nature
that
it
brought
the
irrepressible
tears
into
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
a
courage
that
Madame
Defarge
so
little
comprehended
as
to
mistake
for
weakness
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
!
"
she
laughed
,
"
you
poor
wretch
!
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
worth
!
 
<EOS>
I
address
myself
to
that
Doctor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Then
she
raised
her
voice
and
called
out
,
"
Citizen
Doctor
!
 
<EOS>
Wife
of
Evremonde
!
 
<EOS>
Child
of
Evremonde
!
 
<EOS>
Any
person
but
this
miserable
fool
,
answer
the
Citizeness
Defarge
!
"
   
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
following
silence
,
perhaps
some
latent
disclosure
in
the
expression
of
Miss
Pross
's
face
,
perhaps
a
sudden
misgiving
apart
from
either
suggestion
,
whispered
to
Madame
Defarge
that
they
were
gone
.
<EOS>
Three
of
the
doors
she
opened
swiftly
,
and
looked
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
Those
rooms
are
all
in
disorder
,
there
has
been
hurried
packing
,
there
are
odds
and
ends
upon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
one
in
that
room
behind
you
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
look
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
who
understood
the
request
as
perfectly
as
Madame
Defarge
understood
the
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
they
are
not
in
that
room
,
they
are
gone
,
and
can
be
pursued
and
brought
back
,
"
said
Madame
Defarge
to
herself
.
   
<EOS>
"
As
long
as
you
do
n't
know
whether
they
are
in
that
room
or
not
,
you
are
uncertain
what
to
do
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
to
herself
;
"
<EOS>
and
you
shall
not
know
that
,
if
I
can
prevent
your
knowing
it
;
and
know
that
,
or
not
know
that
,
you
shall
not
leave
here
while
I
can
hold
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
in
the
streets
from
the
first
,
nothing
has
stopped
me
,
I
will
tear
you
to
pieces
,
but
I
will
have
you
from
that
door
,
"
said
Madame
Defarge
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
alone
at
the
top
of
a
high
house
in
a
solitary
courtyard
,
we
are
not
likely
to
be
heard
,
and
I
pray
for
bodily
strength
to
keep
you
here
,
while
every
minute
you
are
here
is
worth
a
hundred
thousand
guineas
to
my
darling
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
.
   
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
made
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pross
,
on
the
instinct
of
the
moment
,
seized
her
round
the
waist
in
both
her
arms
,
and
held
her
tight
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
for
Madame
Defarge
to
struggle
and
to
strike
;
Miss
Pross
,
with
the
vigorous
tenacity
of
love
,
always
so
much
stronger
than
hate
,
clasped
her
tight
,
and
even
lifted
her
from
the
floor
in
the
struggle
that
they
had
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
hands
of
Madame
Defarge
buffeted
and
tore
her
face
;
but
,
Miss
Pross
,
with
her
head
down
,
held
her
round
the
waist
,
and
clung
to
her
with
more
than
the
hold
of
a
drowning
woman
.
   
<EOS>
Soon
,
Madame
Defarge
's
hands
ceased
to
strike
,
and
felt
at
her
encircled
waist
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
under
my
arm
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
in
smothered
tones
,
"
you
shall
not
draw
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
stronger
than
you
,
I
bless
Heaven
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
hold
you
till
one
or
other
of
us
faints
or
dies
!
"
   
<EOS>
Madame
Defarge
's
hands
were
at
her
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pross
looked
up
,
saw
what
it
was
,
struck
at
it
,
struck
out
a
flash
and
a
crash
,
and
stood
alone
---
blinded
with
smoke
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
was
in
a
second
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
smoke
cleared
,
leaving
an
awful
stillness
,
it
passed
out
on
the
air
,
like
the
soul
of
the
furious
woman
whose
body
lay
lifeless
on
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
first
fright
and
horror
of
her
situation
,
Miss
Pross
passed
the
body
as
far
from
it
as
she
could
,
and
ran
down
the
stairs
to
call
for
fruitless
help
.
 
<EOS>
Happily
,
she
bethought
herself
of
the
consequences
of
what
she
did
,
in
time
to
check
herself
and
go
back
.
<EOS>
It
was
dreadful
to
go
in
at
the
door
again
;
but
,
she
did
go
in
,
and
even
went
near
it
,
to
get
the
bonnet
and
other
things
that
she
must
wear
.
 
<EOS>
These
she
put
on
,
out
on
the
staircase
,
first
shutting
and
locking
the
door
and
taking
away
the
key
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
sat
down
on
the
stairs
a
few
moments
to
breathe
and
to
cry
,
and
then
got
up
and
hurried
away
.
   
<EOS>
By
good
fortune
she
had
a
veil
on
her
bonnet
,
or
she
could
hardly
have
gone
along
the
streets
without
being
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
By
good
fortune
,
too
,
she
was
naturally
so
peculiar
in
appearance
as
not
to
show
disfigurement
like
any
other
woman
.
 
<EOS>
She
needed
both
advantages
,
for
the
marks
of
griping
fingers
were
deep
in
her
face
,
and
her
hair
was
torn
,
and
her
dress
(
hastily
composed
with
unsteady
hands
)
was
clutched
and
dragged
a
hundred
ways
.
   
<EOS>
In
crossing
the
bridge
,
she
dropped
the
door
key
in
the
river
.
<EOS>
Arriving
at
the
cathedral
some
few
minutes
before
her
escort
,
and
waiting
there
<EOS>
,
she
thought
,
what
if
the
key
were
already
taken
in
a
net
,
what
if
it
were
identified
,
what
if
the
door
were
opened
and
the
remains
discovered
,
what
if
she
were
stopped
at
the
gate
,
sent
to
prison
,
and
charged
with
murder
!
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
these
fluttering
thoughts
,
the
escort
appeared
,
took
her
in
,
and
took
her
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
noise
in
the
streets
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
usual
noises
,
"
Mr
Cruncher
replied
;
and
looked
surprised
by
the
question
and
by
her
aspect
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
hear
you
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
for
Mr
Cruncher
to
repeat
what
he
said
;
Miss
Pross
could
not
hear
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
'll
nod
my
head
,
"
thought
Mr
Cruncher
,
amazed
,
"
at
all
events
she
'll
see
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
did
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
noise
in
the
streets
now
?
"
asked
Miss
Pross
again
,
presently
.
   
<EOS>
Again
Mr
Cruncher
nodded
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
hear
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Gone
deaf
in
an
hour
?
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
,
ruminating
,
with
his
mind
much
disturbed
;
"
wot
's
come
to
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
feel
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
"
as
if
there
had
been
a
flash
and
a
crash
,
and
that
crash
was
the
last
thing
I
should
ever
hear
in
this
life
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Blest
if
she
ai
n't
in
a
queer
condition
!
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
,
more
and
more
disturbed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wot
can
she
have
been
a
takin
'
,
to
keep
her
courage
up
?
 
<EOS>
Hark
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
the
roll
of
them
<EOS>
dreadful
carts
!
 
<EOS>
You
can
hear
that
,
miss
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
hear
,
"
said
Miss
Pross
,
seeing
that
he
spoke
to
her
,
"
nothing
.
<EOS>
O
,
my
good
man
,
there
was
first
a
great
crash
,
and
then
a
great
stillness
,
and
that
stillness
seems
to
be
fixed
and
unchangeable
,
never
to
be
broken
any
more
as
long
as
my
life
lasts
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
she
do
n't
hear
the
roll
of
those
dreadful
carts
,
now
very
nigh
their
journey
's
end
,
"
said
Mr
Cruncher
,
glancing
over
his
shoulder
,
"
it
's
my
opinion
that
indeed
she
never
will
hear
anything
else
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
And
indeed
she
never
did
.

The
Footsteps
Die
Out
For
Ever
 
Along
the
Paris
streets
,
the
death
-
carts
rumble
,
hollow
and
harsh
.
<EOS>
Six
tumbrils
carry
the
day
's
wine
to
La
Guillotine
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
devouring
and
insatiate
Monsters
imagined
since
imagination
could
record
itself
,
are
fused
in
the
one
realisation
,
Guillotine
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
there
is
not
in
France
,
with
its
rich
variety
of
soil
and
climate
,
a
blade
,
a
leaf
,
a
root
,
a
sprig
,
a
peppercorn
,
which
will
grow
to
maturity
under
conditions
more
certain
than
those
that
have
produced
this
horror
.
 
<EOS>
Crush
humanity
out
of
shape
once
more
,
under
similar
hammers
,
and
it
will
twist
itself
into
the
same
tortured
forms
.
<EOS>
Sow
the
same
seed
of
rapacious
license
and
oppression
over
again
,
and
it
will
surely
yield
the
same
fruit
according
to
its
kind
.
   
<EOS>
Six
tumbrils
roll
along
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
Change
these
back
again
to
what
they
were
,
thou
powerful
enchanter
,
Time
,
and
they
shall
be
seen
to
be
the
carriages
of
absolute
monarchs
,
the
equipages
of
feudal
nobles
,
the
toilettes
of
flaring
Jezebels
,
the
churches
that
are
not
my
father
's
house
but
dens
of
thieves
,
the
huts
of
millions
of
starving
peasants
!
 
<EOS>
No
;
the
great
magician
who
majestically
works
out
the
appointed
order
of
the
Creator
,
never
reverses
his
transformations
.
<EOS>
"
If
thou
be
changed
into
this

by
the
will
of
God
,
"
say
the
seers
to
the
enchanted
,
in
the
wise
Arabian
stories
,
"
then
remain
so
!
<EOS>
But
,
if
thou
wear
this
form
through
mere
passing
conjuration
,
then
resume
thy
former
aspect
!
"
 
<EOS>
Changeless
and
hopeless
,
the
tumbrils
roll
along
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
sombre
wheels
of
the
six
carts
go
round
,
they
seem
to
plough
up
a
long
crooked
furrow
among
the
populace
in
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
Ridges
of
faces
are
thrown
to
this
side
and
to
that
,
and
the
ploughs
go
steadily
onward
.
 
<EOS>
So
used
are
the
regular
inhabitants
of
the
houses
to
the
spectacle
,
that
in
many
windows
there
are
no
people
,
and
in
some
the
occupation
of
the
hands
is
not
so
much
as
suspended
,
while
the
eyes
survey
the
faces
in
the
tumbrils
.
 
<EOS>
Here
and
there
,
the
inmate
has
visitors
to
see
the
sight
;
then
he
points
his
finger
,
with
something
of
the
complacency
of
a
curator
or
authorised
exponent
,
to
this
cart
and
to
this
,
and
seems
to
tell
who
sat
here
yesterday
,
and
who
there
the
day
before
.
   
<EOS>
Of
the
riders
in
the
tumbrils
,
some
observe
these
things
,
and
all
things
on
their
last
roadside
,
with
an
impassive
stare
;
others
,
with
a
lingering
interest
in
the
ways
of
life
and
men
.
 
<EOS>
Some
,
seated
with
drooping
heads
,
are
sunk
in
silent
despair
;
again
,
there
are
some
so
heedful
of
their
looks
that
they
cast
upon
the
multitude
such
glances
as
they
have
seen
in
theatres
,
and
in
pictures
.
 
<EOS>
Several
close
their
eyes
,
and
think
,
or
try
to
get
their
straying
thoughts
together
.
<EOS>
Only
one
,
and
he
a
miserable
creature
,
of
a
crazed
aspect
,
is
so
shattered
and
made
drunk
by
horror
,
that
he
sings
,
and
tries
to
dance
.
 
<EOS>
Not
one
of
the
whole
number
appeals
by
look
or
gesture
,
to
the
pity
of
the
people
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
a
guard
of
sundry
horsemen
riding
abreast
of
the
tumbrils
,
and
faces
are
often
turned
up
to
some
of
them
,
and
they
are
asked
some
question
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
seem
to
be
always
the
same
question
,
for
<EOS>
,
it
is
always
followed
by
a
press
of
people
towards
the
third
cart
.
<EOS>
The
horsemen
abreast
of
that
cart
,
frequently
point
out
one
man
in
it
with
their
swords
.
<EOS>
The
leading
curiosity
is
,
to
know
which
is
he
;
he
stands
at
the
back
of
the
tumbril
with
his
head
bent
down
,
to
converse
with
a
mere
girl
who
sits
on
the
side
of
the
cart
,
and
holds
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
no
curiosity
or
care
for
the
scene
about
him
,
and
always
speaks
to
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Here
and
there
in
the
long
street
of
St
Honore
,
cries
are
raised
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
move
him
at
all
,
it
is
only
to
a
quiet
smile
,
as
he
shakes
his
hair
a
little
more
loosely
about
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
not
easily
touch
his
face
,
his
arms
being
bound
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
steps
of
a
church
,
awaiting
the
coming
-
up
of
the
tumbrils
,
stands
the
Spy
and
prison
-
sheep
.
 
<EOS>
He
looks
into
the
first
of
them
:
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
looks
into
the
second
:
 
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
already
asks
himself
,
"
Has
he
sacrificed
me
?
"
<EOS>
when
his
face
clears
,
as
he
looks
into
the
third
.
   
<EOS>
"
Which
is
Evremonde
?
"
says
a
man
behind
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
back
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
his
hand
in
the
girl
's
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
man
cries
,
"
Down
,
Evremonde
!
 
<EOS>
To
the
Guillotine
all
aristocrats
!
<EOS>
Down
,
Evremonde
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
hush
!
"
<EOS>
the
Spy
entreats
him
,
timidly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
why
not
,
citizen
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
going
to
pay
the
forfeit
:
 
it
will
be
paid
in
five
minutes
more
.
<EOS>
Let
him
be
at
peace
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
the
man
continuing
to
exclaim
,
"
Down
,
Evremonde
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
face
of
Evremonde
is
for
a
moment
turned
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
Evremonde
then
sees
the
Spy
,
and
looks
attentively
at
him
,
and
goes
his
way
.
   
<EOS>
The
clocks
are
on
the
stroke
of
three
,
and
the
furrow
ploughed
among
the
populace
is
turning
round
,
to
come
on
into
the
place
of
execution
,
and
end
.
 
<EOS>
The
ridges
thrown
to
this
side
and
to
that
,
now
crumble
in
and
close
behind
the
last
plough
as
it
passes
on
,
for
all
are
following
to
the
Guillotine
.
 
<EOS>
In
front
of
it
,
seated
in
chairs
,
as
in
a
garden
of
public
diversion
,
are
a
number
of
women
,
busily
knitting
.
 
<EOS>
On
one
of
the
fore
-
most
chairs
,
stands
The
Vengeance
,
looking
about
for
her
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
Therese
!
"
<EOS>
she
cries
,
in
her
shrill
tones
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
has
seen
her

<EOS>
Therese
Defarge

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
never
missed

says
a
knitting
-
woman
of
the
sisterhood
.
   
<EOS>
"
No

nor
will
she
miss
now
<EOS>

cries
The
Vengeance
,
petulantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Therese
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Louder

"
the
woman
recommends
.
   
<EOS>
Ay

<EOS>
Louder
,
Vengeance
,
much
louder
,
and
still
she
will
scarcely
hear
thee

<EOS>
Louder
<EOS>
yet
,
Vengeance
,
with
a
little
oath
or
so
added
,
and
yet
it
will
hardly
bring
her
.
 
<EOS>
Send
other
women
up
and
down
to
seek
her
,
lingering
somewhere
;
and
yet
,
although
the
messengers
have
done
dread
deeds
,
it
is
questionable
whether
of
their
own
wills
they
will
go
far
enough
to
find
her
!
   
<EOS>
"
Bad
Fortune
!
<EOS>
"
cries
The
Vengeance
,
stamping
her
foot
in
the
chair
,
"
and
here
are
the
tumbrils
!
 
<EOS>
And
Evremonde
will
be
despatched
in
a
wink
,
and
she
not
here
!
 
<EOS>
See
her
knitting
in
my
hand
,
and
her
empty
chair
ready
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
cry
with
vexation
and
disappointment
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
The
Vengeance
descends
from
her
elevation
to
do
it
,
the
tumbrils
begin
to
discharge
their
loads
.
 
<EOS>
The
ministers
of
Sainte
Guillotine
are
robed
and
ready

<EOS>
Crash

<EOS>
---
A
head
is
held
up
,
and
the
knitting
-
women
who
scarcely
lifted
their
eyes
to
look
at
it
a
moment
ago
when
it
could
think
and
speak
,
count
One

<EOS>
The
second
tumbril
empties
and
moves
on
;
the
third
comes
up

<EOS>
Crash

<EOS>
---
And
the
knitting
-
women
,
never
faltering
or
pausing
in
their
Work
,
count
Two
.
   
<EOS>
The
supposed
Evremonde
descends
,
and
the
seamstress
is
lifted
out
next
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
not
relinquished
her
patient
hand
in
getting
out
,
but
still
holds
it
as
he
promised
.
 
<EOS>
He
gently
places
her
with
her
back
to
the
crashing
engine
that
constantly
whirrs
up
and
falls
,
and
she
looks
into
his
face
and
thanks
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
for
you

dear
stranger

I
should
not

so
composed

naturally

faint

The

What
I
have
been
thinking
as
we
came
along
,
and
what
I
am
still
thinking
now
,
as
I
look
into
your
kind
strong
face
which
gives
me
so
much
support
,
is
this
:
---
If
the
Republic
really
does
good
to
the
poor
,
and
they
come
to
be
less
hungry
,
and
in
all
ways
to
suffer
less
,
she
may
live
a
long
time
:
 
<EOS>
she
may
even
live
to
be
old
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
then
,
my
gentle
sister
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
:
"
the
uncomplaining
eyes
in
which
there
is
so
much
endurance
,
fill
with
tears
,
and
the
lips
part
a
little
more
and
tremble
:
 
"
that
it
will
seem
long
to
me
,
while
I
wait
for
her
in
the
better
land
where
I
trust
both
you
<EOS>
and
I
will
be
mercifully
sheltered
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
,
my
child
;
there
is
no
Time
there
,
and
no
trouble
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
comfort
me
so
much
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
ignorant
.
 
<EOS>
Am
I
to
kiss
you
now
?
<EOS>
Is
the
moment
come
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
kisses
his
lips
;
he
kisses
hers
;
they
solemnly
bless
each
other
.
<EOS>
The
spare
hand
does
not
tremble
as
he
releases
it
;
nothing
worse
than
a
sweet
,
bright
constancy
is
in
the
patient
face
.
 
<EOS>
She
goes
next
before
him
---
is
gone
;
the
knitting
-
women
count
Twenty
-
Two
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
Resurrection
and
the
Life
,
saith
the
Lord
:
he
that
believeth
in
me
,
though
he
were
dead
,
yet
shall
he
live
:
and
whosoever
liveth
and
believeth
in
me
shall
never
die
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
murmuring
of
many
voices
,
the
upturning
of
many
faces
,
the
pressing
on
of
many
footsteps
in
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
,
so
that
it
swells
forward
in
a
mass
,
like
one
great
heave
of
water
,
all
flashes
away
.
<EOS>
Twenty
-
Three
.
   
<EOS>
They
said
of
him
,
about
the
city
that
night
,
that
it
was
the
peacefullest
man
's
face
ever
beheld
there
.
 
<EOS>
Many
added
that
he
looked
sublime
and
prophetic
.
   
<EOS>
One
of
the
most
remarkable
sufferers
by
the
same
axe
---
a
woman
-
had
asked
at
the
foot
of
the
same
scaffold
,
not
long
before
,
to
be
allowed
to
write
down
the
thoughts
that
were
inspiring
her
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
given
any
utterance
to
his
,
and
they
were
prophetic
,
they
would
have
been
these
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
Barsad
,
and
Cly
,
Defarge
,
The
Vengeance
,
the
Juryman
,
the
Judge
,
long
ranks
of
the
new
oppressors
who
have
risen
on
the
destruction
of
the
old
,
perishing
by
this
retributive
instrument
,
before
it
shall
cease
out
of
its
present
use
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
a
beautiful
city
and
a
brilliant
people
rising
from
this
abyss
,
and
,
in
their
struggles
to
be
truly
free
,
in
their
triumphs
and
defeats
,
<EOS>
through
long
years
to
come
,
I
see
the
evil
of
this
time
and
of
the
previous
time
of
which
this
is
the
natural
birth
,
gradually
making
expiation
for
itself
and
wearing
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
the
lives
for
which
I
lay
down
my
life
,
peaceful
,
useful
,
prosperous
and
happy
,
in
that
England
which
I
shall
see
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
see
Her
with
a
child
upon
her
bosom
,
who
bears
my
name
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
her
father
,
aged
and
bent
,
but
otherwise
restored
,
and
faithful
to
all
men
in
his
healing
office
,
and
at
peace
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
good
old
man
,
<EOS>
so
long
their
friend
,
in
ten
years
'
time
enriching
them
with
all
he
has
,
and
passing
tranquilly
to
his
reward
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
that
I
hold
a
sanctuary
in
their
hearts
,
and
in
the
hearts
of
their
descendants
,
generations
hence
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
her
,
an
old
woman
,
weeping
for
me
on
the
anniversary
of
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
her
and
her
husband
,
their
course
done
,
lying
side
by
side
in
their
last
earthly
bed
,
and
I
know
that
each
was
not
more
honoured
and
held
sacred
in
the
other
's
soul
,
than
I
was
in
the
souls
of
both
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
that
child
who
lay
upon
her
bosom
and
who
bore
my
name
,
a
man
winning
his
way
up
in
that
path
of
life
which
once
was
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
winning
it
<EOS>
so
well
,
that
my
name
is
made
illustrious
there
by
the
light
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
blots
I
threw
upon
it
,
faded
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
,
fore
-
most
of
just
judges
and
honoured
men
,
bringing
a
boy
of
my
name
,
with
a
forehead
that
I
know
and
golden
hair
,
to
this
place
---
then
fair
to
look
upon
,
with
not
a
trace
of
this
day
's
disfigurement
 
---
<EOS>
and
I
hear
him
tell
the
child
my
story
,
with
a
tender
and
a
faltering
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
far
,
far
better
thing
that
I
do
,
than
I
have
ever
done
;
it
is
a
far
,
far
better
rest
that
I
go
to
than
I
have
ever
known
.
