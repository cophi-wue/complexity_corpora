Going
Away
 
<EOS>
I
SHALL
never
forget
the
one
-
fourth
serious
and
three
-
fourths
comical
astonishment
,
with
which
,
on
the
morning
of
the
third
of
January
eighteen
-
hundred
-
and
-
forty
-
two
,
I
opened
the
door
of
,
and
put
my
head
into
,
a
"
state
-
room
"
on
board
the
Britannia
steam
-
packet
,
twelve
hundred
tons
burthen
per
register
,
bound
for
Halifax
and
Boston
,
and
carrying
Her
Majesty
's
mails
.
   
<EOS>
That
this
state
-
room
had
been
specially
engaged
for
"
Charles
Dickens
,
Esquire
,
and
Lady
,
"
was
rendered
sufficiently
clear
even
to
my
scared
intellect
by
a
very
small
manuscript
,
announcing
the
fact
,
which
was
pinned
on
a
very
flat
quilt
,
covering
a
very
thin
mattress
,
spread
like
a
surgical
plaster
on
a
most
inaccessible
shelf
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
this
was
the
state
-
room
concerning
which
Charles
Dickens
,
Esquire
,
and
Lady
,
had
held
daily
and
nightly
conferences
for
at
least
four
months
preceding
:
 
that
this
could
by
any
possibility
be
that
small
snug
chamber
of
the
imagination
,
which
Charles
Dickens
,
Esquire
,
with
the
spirit
of
prophecy
strong
upon
him
,
had
always
foretold
would
contain
<EOS>
at
least
one
little
sofa
,
and
which
his
lady
,
with
a
modest
yet
most
magnificent
sense
of
its
limited
dimensions
,
had
from
the
first
opined
would
not
hold
more
than
two
enormous
portmanteaus
in
some
odd
corner
out
of
sight
(
portmanteaus
which
could
now
no
more
be
got
in
at
the
door
,
not
to
say
stowed
away
,
than
a
giraffe
could
be
persuaded
or
forced
into
a
flower
-
pot
)
:
 
that
this
utterly
impracticable
,
thoroughly
hopeless
,
and
profoundly
preposterous
box
,
had
the
remotest
reference
to
,
or
connection
with
,
those
chaste
and
pretty
,
not
to
say
gorgeous
little
bowers
,
sketched
by
a
masterly
hand
,
in
the
highly
varnished
lithographic
plan
hanging
up
in
the
agent
's
counting
-
house
in
the
city
of
London
:
 
that
this
room
of
state
,
in
short
,
could
be
anything
but
a
pleasant
fiction
and
cheerful
jest
of
the
captain
's
,
invented
and
put
in
practice
for
the
better
relish
and
enjoyment
of
the
real
state
-
room
presently
to
be
disclosed
:
---
these
were
truths
which
I
really
could
not
,
for
the
moment
,
bring
my
mind
at
all
to
bear
upon
or
comprehend
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
sat
down
upon
a
kind
of
horsehair
slab
,
or
perch
,
of
which
there
were
two
within
;
and
looked
,
without
any
expression
of
countenance
whatever
,
at
some
friends
who
had
come
on
board
with
us
,
and
who
were
crushing
their
faces
into
all
manner
of
shapes
by
endeavouring
to
squeeze
them
through
the
small
doorway
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
experienced
a
pretty
smart
shock
before
coming
below
,
<EOS>
which
,
but
that
we
were
the
most
sanguine
people
living
,
might
have
prepared
us
for
the
worst
.
 
<EOS>
The
imaginative
artist
to
whom
I
have
already
made
allusion
,
has
depicted
in
the
same
great
work
,
a
chamber
of
almost
interminable
perspective
,
furnished
,
as
Mr
Robins
would
say
,
in
a
style
of
more
than
Eastern
splendour
,
and
filled
(
but
not
inconveniently
so
)
with
groups
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
in
the
very
highest
state
of
enjoyment
and
vivacity
.
<EOS>
Before
descending
into
the
bowels
of
the
ship
,
we
had
passed
from
the
deck
into
a
long
narrow
apartment
,
not
unlike
a
gigantic
hearse
with
windows
in
the
sides
;
having
at
the
upper
end
a
melancholy
stove
,
at
which
three
or
four
chilly
stewards
were
warming
their
hands
;
while
on
either
side
,
extending
down
its
whole
dreary
length
,
was
a
long
,
long
table
,
over
each
of
which
a
rack
,
fixed
to
the
low
roof
,
and
stuck
full
of
drinking
-
glasses
and
cruet
-
stands
,
hinted
dismally
at
rolling
seas
and
heavy
weather
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
not
at
that
time
seen
the
ideal
presentment
of
this
chamber
which
has
since
gratified
me
so
much
,
but
I
observed
that
one
of
our
friends
who
had
made
the
arrangements
for
our
voyage
,
turned
pale
on
entering
,
retreated
on
the
friend
behind
him
.
<EOS>
,
smote
his
forehead
involuntarily
,
and
said
below
his
breath
,
"
<EOS>
Impossible
!
<EOS>
it
can
not
be
!
"
<EOS>
or
words
to
that
effect
.
 
<EOS>
He
recovered
himself
however
by
a
great
effort
,
and
after
a
preparatory
cough
or
two
,
cried
,
with
a
ghastly
smile
which
is
still
before
me
,
looking
at
the
same
time
<EOS>
round
the
walls
,
"
Ha
!
<EOS>
the
breakfast
-
room
,
steward
---
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
all
foresaw
what
the
answer
must
be
:
 
<EOS>
we
knew
the
agony
he
suffered
.
<EOS>
He
had
often
spoken
of
THE
SALOON
;
had
taken
in
and
lived
upon
the
pictorial
idea
;
had
usually
given
us
to
understand
,
at
home
,
that
to
form
a
just
conception
of
it
,
it
would
be
necessary
to
multiply
the
size
and
furniture
of
an
ordinary
drawing
-
room
by
seven
,
and
then
fall
short
of
the
reality
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
man
in
reply
avowed
the
truth
;
the
blunt
,
remorseless
,
naked
truth
;
"
This
is
the
saloon
,
sir
"
---
he
actually
reeled
beneath
the
blow
.
   
<EOS>
In
persons
who
were
so
soon
to
part
,
and
interpose
between
their
else
daily
communication
the
formidable
barrier
of
many
thousand
miles
of
stormy
space
,
and
who
were
for
that
reason
anxious
to
cast
no
other
cloud
,
not
even
the
passing
shadow
of
a
moment
's
disappointment
or
discomfiture
,
upon
the
short
interval
of
happy
companionship
that
yet
remained
to
them
---
in
persons
so
situated
,
the
natural
transition
from
these
first
surprises
was
obviously
into
peals
of
hearty
laughter
,
and
I
can
report
that
I
,
for
one
,
being
still
seated
upon
the
slab
or
perch
before
mentioned
,
roared
outright
until
the
vessel
rang
again
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
in
less
than
two
minutes
after
coming
upon
it
for
the
first
time
,
we
all
by
common
consent
agreed
that
this
state
-
room
was
the
pleasantest
and
most
facetious
and
capital
contrivance
possible
;
and
that
to
have
had
it
one
inch
larger
,
would
have
been
quite
a
disagreeable
and
deplorable
state
of
things
.
 
<EOS>
And
with
this
;
and
with
showing
how
,
---
by
very
nearly
closing
the
door
,
and
twining
in
and
out
like
serpents
,
and
by
counting
the
little
washing
slab
as
standing
-
room
,
---
we
could
manage
to
insinuate
four
people
into
it
,
all
at
one
time
;
and
entreating
each
other
to
observe
how
very
airy
it
was
(
in
dock
)
,
and
how
there
was
a
beautiful
port
-
hole
which
could
be
kept
open
all
day
(
weather
permitting
)
,
and
how
there
was
quite
a
large
bull's
-
eye
just
over
the
looking
-
glass
which
would
render
shaving
a
perfectly
easy
and
delightful
process
(
when
the
ship
did
n't
roll
too
much
)
;
we
arrived
,
at
last
,
at
the
unanimous
conclusion
that
it
was
rather
spacious
than
otherwise
:
 
though
I
do
verily
believe
that
,
deducting
the
two
berths
,
one
above
the
other
,
than
which
nothing
smaller
for
sleeping
in
was
ever
made
except
coffins
,
it
was
no
bigger
than
one
of
those
hackney
cabriolets
which
have
the
door
behind
,
and
shoot
their
fares
out
,
like
sacks
of
coals
,
upon
the
pavement
.
   
<EOS>
Having
settled
this
point
to
the
perfect
satisfaction
of
all
parties
,
concerned
and
unconcerned
,
we
sat
down
round
the
fire
in
the
ladies
'
cabin
---
just
to
try
the
effect
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
rather
dark
,
certainly
;
but
somebody
said
,
"
of
course
it
would
be
light
,
at
sea
,
"
a
proposition
to
which
we
all
assented
;
echoing
"
of
course
,
of
course
;
"
though
it
would
be
exceedingly
difficult
to
say
why
we
thought
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
,
too
,
when
we
had
discovered
and
exhausted
another
topic
of
consolation
in
the
circumstance
of
this
ladies
'
cabin
adjoining
our
state
-
room
,
and
the
consequently
immense
feasibility
of
sitting
there
at
all
times
and
seasons
,
and
had
fallen
into
a
momentary
silence
,
leaning
our
faces
on
our
hands
and
looking
at
the
fire
,
one
of
our
party
said
,
with
the
solemn
air
of
a
man
who
had
made
a
discovery
,
"
What
a
relish
mulled
claret
will
have
down
here
!
"
<EOS>
which
appeared
to
strike
us
all
most
forcibly
;
as
though
there
were
something
spicy
and
high
-
flavoured
in
cabins
,
which
essentially
improved
that
composition
,
and
rendered
it
quite
incapable
of
perfection
anywhere
else
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
stewardess
,
too
,
actively
engaged
in
producing
clean
sheets
and
table
-
cloths
from
the
very
entrails
of
the
sofas
,
and
from
unexpected
lockers
,
of
such
artful
mechanism
,
that
it
made
one
's
head
ache
to
see
them
opened
one
after
another
,
and
rendered
it
quite
a
distracting
circumstance
to
follow
her
proceedings
,
and
to
find
that
every
nook
and
corner
and
individual
piece
of
furniture
was
something
else
besides
what
it
pretended
to
be
,
and
was
a
mere
trap
and
deception
and
place
of
secret
stowage
,
<EOS>
whose
ostensible
purpose
was
its
least
useful
one
.
   
<EOS>
God
bless
that
stewardess
for
her
piously
fraudulent
account
of
January
voyages
!
 
<EOS>
God
bless
her
for
her
clear
recollection
of
the
companion
passage
of
last
year
,
when
nobody
was
ill
,
and
everybody
dancing
from
morning
to
night
,
and
it
was
"
a
run
"
of
twelve
days
,
and
a
piece
of
the
purest
frolic
,
and
delight
,
and
jollity
!
 
<EOS>
All
happiness
be
with
her
for
her
bright
face
and
her
pleasant
Scotch
tongue
,
which
had
sounds
of
old
Home
in
it
for
my
fellow
-
traveller
;
and
for
her
predictions
of
fair
winds
and
fine
weather
(
all
wrong
,
or
I
should
n't
be
half
so
fond
of
her
)
;
and
for
the
ten
thousand
small
fragments
of
genuine
womanly
tact
,
by
which
,
without
piecing
them
elaborately
together
,
and
patching
them
up
into
shape
and
form
and
case
and
pointed
application
,
she
nevertheless
did
plainly
show
that
all
young
mothers
on
one
side
of
the
Atlantic
were
near
and
close
at
hand
to
their
little
children
left
upon
the
other
;
and
that
what
seemed
to
the
uninitiated
a
serious
journey
,
was
,
to
those
who
were
in
the
secret
,
a
mere
frolic
,
to
be
sung
about
and
whistled
at
!
 
<EOS>
Light
be
her
heart
,
and
gay
her
merry
eyes
,
for
years
!
   
<EOS>
The
state
-
room
had
grown
pretty
fast
;
but
by
this
time
it
had
expanded
into
something
quite
bulky
,
and
almost
boasted
a
bay
-
window
to
view
the
sea
from
.
 
<EOS>
So
we
went
upon
deck
again
in
high
spirits
;
and
there
,
everything
was
in
such
a
state
of
bustle
and
active
preparation
,
that
the
blood
quickened
its
pace
,
and
whirled
through
one
's
veins
on
that
clear
frosty
morning
with
involuntary
mirthfulness
.
 
<EOS>
For
every
gallant
ship
was
riding
slowly
up
and
down
,
and
every
little
boat
was
splashing
noisily
in
the
water
;
and
knots
of
people
stood
upon
the
wharf
,
gazing
with
a
kind
of
"
dread
delight
"
on
the
far
-
famed
fast
American
steamer
;
and
one
party
of
men
were
"
taking
in
the
milk
,
"
or
,
in
other
words
,
getting
the
cow
on
board
;
and
another
were
filling
the
icehouses
to
the
very
throat
with
fresh
provisions
;
with
butchers'-meat
and
garden
-
stuff
,
pale
sucking
-
pigs
,
calves
'
heads
in
scores
,
beef
,
veal
,
and
pork
,
and
poultry
out
of
all
proportion
;
and
others
were
coiling
ropes
and
busy
with
oakum
yarns
;
and
others
were
lowering
heavy
packages
into
the
hold
;
and
the
purser
's
head
was
barely
visible
as
it
loomed
in
a
state
,
of
exquisite
perplexity
from
the
midst
of
a
vast
pile
of
passengers
'
luggage
;
and
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
going
on
anywhere
,
or
uppermost
in
the
mind
of
anybody
,
but
preparations
for
this
mighty
voyage
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
with
the
bright
cold
sun
,
the
bracing
air
,
the
crisply
-
curling
water
,
the
thin
white
crust
of
morning
ice
upon
the
decks
which
crackled
with
a
sharp
and
cheerful
sound
beneath
the
lightest
tread
,
was
irresistible
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
,
again
upon
the
shore
,
we
turned
and
saw
from
the
vessel
's
mast
her
name
signalled
in
flags
of
joyous
colours
,
and
fluttering
by
their
side
the
beautiful
American
banner
with
its
stars
and
stripes
,
---
the
long
three
thousand
miles
and
more
,
and
,
longer
still
,
the
six
whole
months
of
absence
,
so
dwindled
and
faded
,
that
the
ship
had
gone
out
and
come
home
again
,
and
<EOS>
it
was
broad
spring
already
in
the
Coburg
Dock
at
Liverpool
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
not
inquired
among
my
medical
acquaintance
,
whether
Turtle
,
and
cold
Punch
,
with
Hock
,
Champagne
,
and
Claret
,
and
all
the
slight
et
cetera
usually
included
in
an
unlimited
order
for
a
good
dinner
---
especially
when
it
is
left
to
the
liberal
construction
of
my
faultless
friend
,
Mr
Radley
,
of
the
Adelphi
Hotel
---
are
peculiarly
calculated
to
suffer
a
sea
-
change
;
or
whether
a
plain
mutton
-
chop
,
and
a
glass
or
two
of
sherry
,
would
be
less
likely
of
conversion
into
foreign
and
disconcerting
material
.
 
<EOS>
My
own
opinion
is
,
that
whether
one
is
discreet
or
indiscreet
in
these
particulars
,
on
the
eve
of
a
sea
-
voyage
,
is
a
matter
of
little
consequence
;
and
that
,
to
use
a
common
phrase
,
"
it
comes
to
very
much
the
same
thing
in
the
end
.
"
 
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
<EOS>
,
I
know
that
the
dinner
of
that
day
was
undeniably
perfect
;
that
it
comprehended
all
these
items
,
and
a
great
many
more
;
and
that
we
all
did
ample
justice
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
know
too
,
that
,
bating
a
certain
tacit
avoidance
of
any
allusion
to
to
-
morrow
;
such
as
may
be
supposed
to
prevail
between
delicate
-
minded
turnkeys
,
and
a
sensitive
prisoner
who
is
to
be
hanged
next
morning
;
we
got
on
very
well
,
and
,
all
things
considered
,
were
merry
enough
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
morning
---
THE
morning
---
came
,
and
we
met
at
breakfast
,
it
was
curious
to
see
how
eager
we
all
were
to
prevent
a
moment
's
pause
in
the
conversation
,
and
how
astoundingly
gay
everybody
was
:
the
forced
spirits
of
each
member
of
the
little
party
having
as
much
likeness
to
his
natural
mirth
,
as
hot
-
house
peas
at
five
guineas
the
quart
,
resemble
in
flavour
the
growth
of
the
dews
,
and
air
,
and
rain
of
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
one
o'clock
,
the
hour
for
going
aboard
,
drew
near
,
this
volubility
dwindled
away
by
little
and
little
,
despite
the
most
persevering
efforts
to
the
contrary
,
until
at
last
,
the
matter
being
now
quite
desperate
,
we
threw
off
all
disguise
;
openly
speculated
upon
where
we
should
be
this
time
to
-
morrow
,
this
time
next
day
,
and
so
forth
;
and
entrusted
a
vast
number
of
messages
to
those
who
intended
returning
to
town
that
night
,
which
were
to
be
delivered
at
home
and
elsewhere
without
fail
,
within
the
very
shortest
possible
space
of
time
after
the
arrival
of
the
railway
train
at
Euston
Square
.
 
<EOS>
And
commissions
and
remembrances
do
so
crowd
upon
one
at
such
a
time
,
that
we
were
still
busied
with
this
employment
when
we
found
ourselves
fused
,
as
it
were
,
into
a
dense
conglomeration
of
passengers
and
passengers
'
friends
and
passengers
'
luggage
,
all
jumbled
together
on
the
deck
of
a
small
steamboat
,
and
panting
and
snorting
off
to
the
packet
,
which
had
worked
out
of
dock
yesterday
afternoon
and
was
now
lying
at
her
moorings
in
the
river
.
   
<EOS>
And
there
she
is
!
<EOS>
all
eyes
are
turned
to
where
she
lies
,
dimly
discernible
through
the
gathering
fog
of
the
early
winter
afternoon
;
every
finger
is
pointed
in
the
same
direction
;
and
murmurs
of
interest
and
admiration
---
as
"
How
beautiful
she
looks
!
"
<EOS>
"
How
trim
she
is
!
"
<EOS>
---
are
heard
on
every
side
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
lazy
gentleman
with
his
hat
on
one
side
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
who
has
dispensed
so
much
consolation
by
inquiring
with
a
yawn
of
another
gentleman
whether
he
is
"
going
across
"
---
as
if
it
were
a
ferry
---
even
he
condescends
to
look
that
way
,
and
nod
his
head
,
as
who
should
say
,
"
No
mistake
about
THAT
:
"
and
not
even
the
sage
Lord
Burleigh
in
his
nod
,
included
half
so
much
as
this
lazy
gentleman
of
might
who
has
made
the
passage
(
as
everybody
on
board
has
found
out
already
;
it
's
impossible
to
say
how
)
thirteen
times
without
a
single
accident
!
 
<EOS>
There
is
another
passenger
very
much
wrapped
-
up
,
who
has
been
frowned
down
by
the
rest
,
and
morally
trampled
upon
and
crushed
,
for
presuming
to
inquire
with
a
timid
interest
how
long
it
is
since
the
poor
President
went
down
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
standing
close
to
the
lazy
gentleman
,
and
says
with
a
faint
smile
that
he
believes
She
is
a
very
strong
Ship
;
to
which
the
lazy
gentleman
,
looking
first
in
his
questioner
's
eye
and
then
very
hard
in
the
wind
's
,
answers
unexpectedly
and
ominously
,
that
She
need
be
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
the
lazy
gentleman
instantly
falls
very
low
in
the
popular
estimation
,
and
the
passengers
,
with
looks
of
defiance
,
whisper
to
each
other
that
he
is
an
ass
,
and
an
impostor
,
and
clearly
do
n't
know
anything
at
all
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
But
we
are
made
fast
alongside
the
packet
,
whose
huge
red
funnel
is
smoking
bravely
,
giving
rich
promise
of
serious
intentions
.
<EOS>
Packing
-
cases
,
portmanteaus
,
carpet
-
bags
,
and
boxes
,
are
already
passed
from
hand
to
hand
,
and
hauled
on
board
with
breathless
rapidity
.
 
<EOS>
The
officers
,
smartly
dressed
,
are
at
the
gangway
handing
the
passengers
up
the
side
,
and
hurrying
the
men
.
 
<EOS>
In
five
minutes
'
time
,
the
little
steamer
is
utterly
deserted
,
and
the
packet
is
beset
and
over
-
run
by
its
late
freight
,
who
instantly
pervade
the
whole
ship
,
and
are
to
be
met
with
by
the
dozen
in
every
nook
and
corner
:
 
swarming
down
below
with
their
own
baggage
,
and
stumbling
over
other
people
's
;
disposing
themselves
comfortably
in
wrong
cabins
,
and
creating
a
most
horrible
confusion
by
having
to
turn
out
again
;
madly
bent
upon
opening
locked
doors
,
and
on
forcing
a
passage
into
all
kinds
of
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
places
where
there
is
no
thoroughfare
;
sending
wild
stewards
,
with
elfin
hair
,
to
and
fro
upon
the
breezy
decks
on
unintelligible
errands
,
impossible
of
execution
:
 
and
in
short
,
creating
the
most
extraordinary
and
bewildering
tumult
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
all
this
,
the
lazy
gentleman
,
who
seems
to
have
no
luggage
of
any
kind
---
not
so
much
as
a
friend
,
even
<EOS>
---
lounges
up
and
down
the
hurricane
deck
,
coolly
puffing
a
cigar
;
and
,
as
this
unconcerned
demeanour
again
exalts
him
in
the
opinion
of
those
who
have
leisure
to
observe
his
proceedings
,
every
time
he
looks
up
at
the
masts
,
or
down
at
the
decks
,
or
over
the
side
,
they
look
there
too
,
as
wondering
whether
he
sees
anything
wrong
anywhere
,
and
hoping
that
,
in
case
he
should
,
he
will
have
the
goodness
to
mention
it
.
   
<EOS>
What
have
we
here
?
 
<EOS>
The
captain
's
boat
!
<EOS>
and
yonder
the
captain
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
by
all
our
hopes
and
wishes
,
the
very
man
he
ought
to
be
!
 
<EOS>
A
well
-
made
,
tight
-
built
,
dapper
little
fellow
;
with
a
ruddy
face
,
which
is
a
letter
of
invitation
to
shake
him
by
both
hands
at
once
;
and
with
a
clear
,
blue
honest
eye
,
that
it
does
one
good
to
see
one
's
sparkling
image
in
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ring
the
bell
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ding
,
ding
,
ding
!
"
<EOS>
the
very
bell
is
in
a
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
for
the
shore
---
who
's
for
the
shore
?
"
---
"
These
gentlemen
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
are
away
,
and
never
said
,
Good
b'ye
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
now
they
wave
it
from
the
little
boat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
b'ye
!
<EOS>
Good
b'ye
!
"
 
<EOS>
Three
cheers
from
them
;
three
more
from
us
;
three
more
from
them
:
 
and
they
are
gone
.
   
<EOS>
To
and
fro
,
to
and
fro
,
to
and
fro
again
a
hundred
times
!
 
<EOS>
This
waiting
for
the
latest
mail
-
bags
is
worse
than
all
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
could
have
gone
off
in
the
midst
of
that
last
burst
,
we
should
have
started
triumphantly
:
 
but
to
lie
here
,
two
hours
and
more
in
the
damp
fog
,
neither
staying
at
home
nor
going
abroad
,
is
letting
one
gradually
down
into
the
very
depths
of
dulness
and
low
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
A
speck
in
the
mist
,
at
last
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
something
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
boat
we
wait
for
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
more
to
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
The
captain
appears
on
the
paddle
-
box
with
his
speaking
trumpet
;
the
officers
take
their
stations
;
all
hands
are
on
the
alert
;
the
flagging
hopes
of
the
passengers
revive
;
the
cooks
pause
in
their
savoury
work
,
and
look
out
with
faces
full
of
interest
.
 
<EOS>
The
boat
comes
alongside
;
the
bags
are
dragged
in
anyhow
,
and
flung
down
for
the
moment
anywhere
.
<EOS>
Three
cheers
more
:
 
and
as
the
first
one
rings
upon
our
ears
,
the
vessel
throbs
like
a
strong
giant
that
has
just
received
the
breath
of
life
;
the
two
great
wheels
turn
fiercely
round
for
the
first
time
;
and
the
noble
ship
,
with
wind
and
tide
astern
,
breaks
proudly
through
the
lashed
and
roaming
water
.

Chapter
02
.
<EOS>
The
Passage
Out
 
<EOS>
WE
all
dined
together
that
day
;
and
a
rather
formidable
party
<EOS>
we
were
:
 
no
fewer
than
eighty
-
six
strong
.
 
<EOS>
The
vessel
being
pretty
deep
in
the
water
,
with
all
her
coals
on
board
and
so
many
passengers
,
and
the
weather
being
calm
and
quiet
,
there
was
but
little
motion
;
so
that
before
the
dinner
was
half
over
,
even
those
passengers
who
were
most
distrustful
of
themselves
plucked
up
amazingly
;
and
those
who
in
the
morning
had
returned
to
the
universal
question
,
<EOS>
"
Are
you
a
good
sailor
?
"
<EOS>
a
very
decided
negative
,
now
either
parried
the
inquiry
with
the
evasive
reply
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
'm
no
worse
than
anybody
else
;
"
or
,
reckless
of
all
moral
obligations
,
answered
boldly
"
<EOS>
Yes
:
"
and
with
some
irritation
too
,
as
though
they
would
add
,
"
I
should
like
to
know
what
you
see
in
ME
,
sir
,
particularly
,
to
justify
suspicion
!
"
   
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
high
tone
of
courage
and
confidence
,
I
could
not
but
observe
that
very
few
remained
long
over
their
wine
;
and
that
everybody
had
an
unusual
love
of
the
open
air
;
and
that
the
favourite
and
most
coveted
seats
were
invariably
those
nearest
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
The
tea
-
table
,
too
,
was
by
no
means
as
well
attended
as
the
dinner
-
table
;
and
there
was
less
whist
-
playing
than
might
have
been
expected
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
with
the
exception
of
one
lady
,
who
had
retired
with
some
precipitation
at
dinner
-
time
,
immediately
after
being
assisted
to
the
finest
cut
of
a
very
yellow
boiled
leg
of
mutton
with
very
green
capers
,
there
were
no
invalids
as
yet
;
and
walking
,
and
smoking
,
and
drinking
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
(
but
always
in
the
open
air
)
,
went
on
with
unabated
spirit
,
until
eleven
o'clock
or
thereabouts
,
when
"
turning
in
"
---
no
sailor
of
seven
hours
'
experience
talks
of
going
to
bed
---
became
the
order
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
perpetual
tramp
of
boot
-
heels
on
the
decks
gave
place
to
a
heavy
silence
,
and
the
whole
human
freight
was
stowed
away
below
,
excepting
a
very
few
stragglers
,
like
myself
,
who
were
probably
,
like
me
,
afraid
to
go
there
.
   
<EOS>
To
one
unaccustomed
to
such
scenes
,
this
is
a
very
striking
time
on
shipboard
.
 
<EOS>
Afterwards
,
and
when
its
novelty
had
long
worn
off
,
it
never
ceased
to
have
a
peculiar
interest
and
charm
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
gloom
through
which
the
great
black
mass
holds
its
direct
and
certain
course
<EOS>
;
the
rushing
water
,
plainly
heard
,
but
dimly
seen
;
the
broad
,
white
,
glistening
track
,
that
follows
in
the
vessel
's
wake
;
the
men
on
the
look
-
out
forward
,
who
would
be
scarcely
visible
against
the
dark
sky
,
but
for
their
blotting
out
some
score
of
glistening
stars
;
the
helmsman
at
the
wheel
,
with
the
illuminated
card
before
him
,
shining
,
a
speck
of
light
amidst
the
darkness
,
like
something
sentient
and
of
Divine
intelligence
;
the
melancholy
sighing
of
the
wind
through
block
,
and
rope
,
and
chain
;
the
gleaming
forth
of
light
from
every
crevice
,
nook
,
and
tiny
piece
of
glass
about
the
decks
,
as
though
the
ship
were
filled
with
fire
in
hiding
,
ready
to
burst
through
any
outlet
,
wild
with
its
resistless
power
of
death
and
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
too
,
and
even
when
the
hour
,
and
all
the
objects
it
exalts
,
have
come
to
be
familiar
,
it
is
difficult
,
alone
and
thoughtful
,
to
hold
them
to
their
proper
shapes
and
forms
.
 
<EOS>
They
change
with
the
wandering
fancy
;
assume
the
semblance
of
things
left
far
away
;
put
on
the
well
-
remembered
aspect
of
favourite
places
dearly
loved
;
and
even
people
them
with
shadows
.
 
<EOS>
Streets
,
houses
,
rooms
;
figures
so
like
their
usual
occupants
,
that
they
have
startled
me
by
their
reality
,
which
far
exceeded
,
as
it
seemed
to
me
,
all
power
of
mine
to
conjure
up
the
absent
;
have
,
many
and
many
a
time
,
at
such
an
hour
,
grown
suddenly
out
of
objects
with
whose
real
look
,
and
use
,
and
purpose
,
I
was
as
well
acquainted
as
with
my
own
two
hands
.
   
<EOS>
My
own
two
hands
,
and
feet
<EOS>
likewise
,
being
very
cold
,
however
,
on
this
particular
occasion
,
I
crept
below
at
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
exactly
comfortable
below
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
decidedly
close
;
and
it
was
impossible
to
be
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
that
extraordinary
compound
of
strange
smells
,
which
is
to
be
found
nowhere
but
on
board
ship
,
and
which
is
such
a
subtle
perfume
that
it
seems
to
enter
at
every
pore
of
the
skin
,
and
whisper
of
the
hold
.
 
<EOS>
Two
passengers
'
wives
(
one
of
them
my
own
)
lay
already
in
silent
agonies
on
the
sofa
;
and
one
lady
's
maid
<EOS>
(
MY
lady
's
)
was
a
mere
bundle
on
the
floor
,
execrating
her
destiny
,
and
pounding
her
curl
-
papers
among
the
stray
boxes
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
sloped
the
wrong
way
:
which
in
itself
was
an
aggravation
scarcely
to
be
borne
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
left
the
door
open
,
a
moment
before
,
in
the
bosom
of
a
gentle
declivity
,
and
,
when
I
turned
to
shut
it
,
it
was
on
the
summit
of
a
lofty
eminence
.
 
<EOS>
Now
every
plank
and
timber
creaked
,
as
if
the
ship
were
made
of
wicker
-
work
;
and
now
crackled
,
like
an
enormous
fire
of
the
driest
possible
twigs
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
for
it
but
bed
;
so
I
went
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
pretty
much
the
same
for
the
next
two
days
,
with
a
tolerably
fair
wind
and
dry
weather
.
 
<EOS>
I
read
in
bed
<EOS>
(
but
to
this
hour
I
do
n't
know
what
)
<EOS>
a
good
deal
;
and
reeled
on
deck
a
little
;
drank
cold
brandy
-
and
-
water
with
an
unspeakable
disgust
,
and
ate
hard
biscuit
perseveringly
:
 
not
ill
,
but
going
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
the
third
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
awakened
out
of
my
sleep
by
a
dismal
shriek
from
my
wife
,
who
demands
to
know
whether
there
's
any
danger
.
 
<EOS>
I
rouse
myself
,
and
look
out
of
bed
.
 
<EOS>
The
water
-
jug
is
plunging
and
leaping
like
a
lively
dolphin
;
all
the
smaller
articles
are
afloat
,
except
my
shoes
,
which
are
stranded
on
a
carpet
-
bag
,
high
and
dry
,
like
a
couple
of
coal
-
barges
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
I
see
them
spring
into
the
air
,
and
behold
the
looking
-
glass
,
which
is
nailed
to
the
wall
,
sticking
fast
upon
the
ceiling
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
the
door
entirely
disappears
,
and
a
new
one
is
opened
in
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
begin
to
comprehend
that
the
state
-
room
is
standing
on
its
head
.
   
<EOS>
Before
it
is
possible
to
make
any
arrangement
at
all
compatible
with
this
novel
state
of
things
,
the
ship
rights
.
 
<EOS>
Before
one
can
say
"
Thank
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
she
wrongs
again
.
 
<EOS>
Before
one
can
cry
she
IS
wrong
,
she
seems
to
have
started
forward
,
and
to
be
a
creature
actually
running
of
its
own
accord
,
with
broken
knees
and
failing
legs
,
through
every
variety
of
hole
and
pitfall
,
and
stumbling
constantly
.
 
<EOS>
Before
one
can
so
much
as
wonder
,
she
takes
a
high
leap
into
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
Before
she
has
well
done
that
,
she
takes
a
deep
dive
into
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
Before
she
has
gained
the
surface
,
she
throws
a
summerset
.
 
<EOS>
The
instant
<EOS>
she
is
on
her
legs
,
she
rushes
backward
.
<EOS>
And
so
she
goes
on
staggering
,
heaving
,
wrestling
,
leaping
,
diving
,
jumping
,
pitching
,
throbbing
,
rolling
,
and
rocking
:
 
and
going
through
all
these
movements
,
sometimes
by
turns
,
and
sometimes
altogether
:
 
until
one
feels
disposed
to
roar
for
mercy
.
   
<EOS>
A
steward
passes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Steward
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
IS
the
matter
?
<EOS>
what
DO
you
call
this
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Rather
a
heavy
sea
on
,
sir
,
and
a
head
-
wind
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
head
-
wind
!
 
<EOS>
Imagine
a
human
face
upon
the
vessel
's
prow
,
with
fifteen
thousand
Samsons
in
one
bent
upon
driving
her
back
,
and
hitting
her
exactly
between
the
eyes
<EOS>
whenever
she
attempts
to
advance
an
inch
.
 
<EOS>
Imagine
the
ship
herself
,
with
every
pulse
and
artery
of
her
huge
body
swollen
and
bursting
under
this
maltreatment
,
sworn
to
go
on
or
die
.
 
<EOS>
Imagine
the
wind
howling
,
the
sea
roaring
,
<EOS>
the
rain
beating
:
 
all
in
furious
array
against
her
.
<EOS>
Picture
the
sky
both
dark
and
wild
,
and
the
clouds
,
in
fearful
sympathy
with
the
waves
,
making
another
ocean
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
Add
to
all
this
,
the
clattering
on
deck
and
down
below
<EOS>
;
the
tread
of
hurried
feet
;
the
loud
hoarse
shouts
of
seamen
;
the
gurgling
in
and
out
of
water
through
the
scuppers
;
with
,
every
now
and
then
,
the
striking
of
a
heavy
sea
upon
the
planks
above
,
with
the
deep
,
dead
,
heavy
sound
of
thunder
heard
within
a
vault
;
---
and
there
is
the
head
-
wind
of
that
January
morning
.
   
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
of
what
may
be
called
the
domestic
noises
of
the
ship
:
 
such
as
the
breaking
of
glass
and
crockery
,
the
tumbling
down
of
stewards
,
the
gambols
,
overhead
,
of
loose
casks
and
truant
dozens
of
bottled
porter
,
and
the
very
remarkable
and
far
from
exhilarating
sounds
raised
in
their
various
state
-
rooms
by
the
seventy
passengers
who
were
too
ill
to
get
up
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
of
them
:
 
for
although
I
lay
listening
to
this
concert
for
three
or
four
days
,
I
do
n't
think
I
heard
it
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
minute
,
<EOS>
at
the
expiration
of
which
term
,
I
lay
down
again
,
excessively
sea
-
sick
.
   
<EOS>
Not
sea
-
sick
,
be
it
understood
,
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
term
:
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
been
:
 
<EOS>
but
in
a
form
which
I
have
never
seen
or
heard
described
,
though
I
have
no
doubt
it
is
very
common
.
 
<EOS>
I
lay
there
,
all
the
day
long
,
quite
coolly
and
contentedly
;
with
no
sense
of
weariness
,
with
no
desire
to
get
up
,
or
get
better
,
or
take
the
air
;
with
no
curiosity
,
or
care
,
or
regret
,
of
any
sort
or
degree
,
saving
that
I
think
I
can
remember
,
in
this
universal
indifference
,
having
a
kind
of
lazy
joy
---
of
fiendish
delight
,
if
anything
so
lethargic
can
be
dignified
with
the
title
---
in
the
fact
of
my
wife
being
too
ill
to
talk
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
may
be
allowed
to
illustrate
my
state
of
mind
by
such
an
example
,
I
should
say
that
I
was
exactly
in
the
condition
of
the
elder
Mr
Willet
,
after
the
incursion
of
the
rioters
into
his
bar
at
Chigwell
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
would
have
surprised
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
in
the
momentary
illumination
of
any
ray
of
intelligence
that
may
have
come
upon
me
in
the
way
of
thoughts
of
Home
,
a
goblin
postman
,
with
a
scarlet
coat
and
bell
,
had
come
into
that
little
kennel
before
me
,
broad
awake
in
broad
day
,
and
,
apologising
for
being
damp
through
walking
in
the
sea
,
had
handed
me
a
letter
directed
to
myself
,
in
familiar
characters
,
I
am
certain
I
should
not
have
felt
one
atom
of
astonishment
:
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
perfectly
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
If
Neptune
himself
had
walked
in
,
with
a
toasted
shark
on
his
trident
,
I
should
have
looked
upon
the
event
as
one
of
the
very
commonest
everyday
occurrences
.
   
<EOS>
Once
---
once
---
I
found
myself
on
deck
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
I
got
there
,
or
what
possessed
me
to
go
there
,
but
there
I
was
;
and
completely
dressed
too
,
with
a
huge
pea
-
coat
on
,
and
<EOS>
a
pair
of
boots
such
as
no
weak
man
in
his
senses
could
ever
have
got
into
.
<EOS>
I
found
myself
standing
,
when
a
gleam
of
consciousness
came
upon
me
,
holding
on
to
something
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
was
the
boatswain
:
 
or
it
may
have
been
the
pump
:
 
or
possibly
the
cow
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
how
long
I
had
been
there
;
whether
a
day
or
a
minute
.
<EOS>
I
recollect
trying
to
think
about
something
(
about
anything
in
the
whole
wide
world
,
I
was
not
particular
)
without
the
smallest
effect
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
even
make
out
which
was
the
sea
,
and
which
<EOS>
the
sky
,
for
the
horizon
seemed
drunk
,
and
was
flying
wildly
about
in
all
directions
.
 
<EOS>
Even
in
that
incapable
state
,
however
,
I
recognised
the
lazy
gentleman
standing
before
me
:
 
nautically
clad
in
a
suit
of
shaggy
blue
,
with
an
oilskin
hat
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
too
imbecile
,
although
I
knew
it
to
be
he
,
to
separate
him
from
his
dress
;
and
tried
to
call
him
<EOS>
,
I
remember
,
PILOT
.
 
<EOS>
After
another
interval
of
total
unconsciousness
,
I
found
he
had
gone
,
and
recognised
another
figure
in
its
place
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
wave
and
fluctuate
before
me
as
though
I
saw
it
reflected
in
an
unsteady
looking
-
glass
;
but
I
knew
it
for
the
captain
;
and
such
was
the
cheerful
influence
of
his
face
,
that
I
tried
to
smile
:
 
<EOS>
yes
,
even
then
I
tried
to
smile
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
by
his
gestures
that
he
addressed
me
;
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
I
could
make
out
that
he
remonstrated
against
my
standing
up
to
my
knees
in
water
---
as
I
was
;
of
course
I
do
n't
know
why
.
 
<EOS>
I
tried
to
thank
him
,
but
could
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
only
point
to
my
boots
---
or
<EOS>
wherever
I
supposed
my
boots
to
be
---
and
say
in
a
plaintive
voice
,
"
Cork
soles
:
"
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
endeavouring
,
I
am
told
,
to
sit
down
in
the
pool
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
that
I
was
quite
insensible
,
and
for
the
time
a
maniac
,
he
humanely
conducted
me
below
.
   
<EOS>
There
I
remained
until
I
got
better
:
 
suffering
,
whenever
I
was
recommended
to
eat
anything
,
an
amount
of
anguish
only
second
to
that
which
is
said
to
be
endured
by
the
apparently
drowned
,
in
the
process
of
restoration
to
life
.
 
<EOS>
One
gentleman
on
board
had
a
letter
of
introduction
to
me
from
a
mutual
friend
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
sent
it
below
with
his
card
,
on
the
morning
of
the
head
-
wind
;
and
I
was
long
troubled
with
the
idea
that
he
might
be
up
,
and
well
,
and
a
hundred
times
a
day
expecting
me
to
call
upon
him
in
the
saloon
.
<EOS>
I
imagined
him
one
of
those
cast
-
iron
images
---
I
will
not
call
them
men
---
who
ask
,
with
red
faces
,
and
lusty
voices
,
what
sea
-
sickness
means
,
and
whether
it
really
is
as
bad
as
it
is
represented
to
be
.
<EOS>
This
was
very
torturing
indeed
;
and
I
do
n't
think
I
ever
felt
such
perfect
gratification
and
gratitude
of
heart
,
as
I
did
when
I
heard
from
the
ship
's
doctor
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
put
a
large
mustard
poultice
on
this
very
gentleman
's
stomach
.
 
<EOS>
I
date
my
recovery
from
the
receipt
of
that
intelligence
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
materially
assisted
though
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
by
a
heavy
gale
of
wind
,
which
came
slowly
up
at
sunset
,
when
we
were
about
ten
days
out
,
and
raged
with
gradually
increasing
fury
until
morning
,
saving
that
it
lulled
for
an
hour
a
little
before
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
the
unnatural
repose
of
that
hour
,
and
in
the
after
gathering
of
the
storm
,
so
inconceivably
awful
and
tremendous
,
that
its
bursting
into
full
violence
was
almost
a
relief
.
   
<EOS>
The
labouring
of
the
ship
in
the
troubled
sea
on
this
night
I
shall
never
forget
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
it
ever
be
worse
than
this
?
<EOS>
"
was
a
question
I
had
often
heard
asked
,
when
everything
was
sliding
and
bumping
about
,
and
when
it
certainly
did
seem
difficult
to
comprehend
the
possibility
of
anything
afloat
being
more
disturbed
,
without
toppling
over
and
going
down
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
the
agitation
of
a
steam
-
vessel
is
,
on
a
bad
winter
's
night
in
the
wild
Atlantic
,
it
is
impossible
for
the
most
vivid
imagination
to
conceive
.
 
<EOS>
To
say
that
she
is
flung
down
on
her
side
in
the
waves
,
with
her
masts
dipping
into
them
,
and
that
,
springing
up
again
,
she
rolls
over
on
the
other
side
,
until
a
heavy
sea
strikes
her
with
the
noise
of
a
hundred
great
guns
,
and
hurls
her
back
---
that
she
stops
,
and
staggers
,
and
shivers
,
as
though
stunned
,
and
then
,
with
a
violent
throbbing
at
her
heart
,
darts
onward
like
a
monster
goaded
into
madness
,
to
be
beaten
down
,
and
battered
,
and
crushed
,
and
leaped
on
by
the
angry
sea
---
that
thunder
,
lightning
,
hail
,
and
rain
,
and
wind
,
are
all
in
fierce
contention
for
the
mastery
---
that
every
plank
has
its
groan
,
<EOS>
every
nail
its
shriek
,
and
every
drop
of
water
in
the
great
ocean
its
howling
voice
---
is
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
To
say
that
all
is
grand
,
and
all
appalling
and
horrible
in
the
last
degree
,
is
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Words
can
not
express
it
.
 
<EOS>
Thoughts
can
not
convey
it
.
<EOS>
Only
a
dream
can
call
it
up
again
,
in
all
its
fury
,
rage
,
and
passion
.
   
<EOS>
And
yet
,
in
the
very
midst
of
these
terrors
,
I
was
placed
in
a
situation
so
exquisitely
ridiculous
,
that
even
then
I
had
as
strong
a
sense
of
its
absurdity
as
I
have
now
,
and
could
no
more
help
laughing
than
I
can
at
any
other
comical
incident
,
happening
under
circumstances
the
most
favourable
to
its
enjoyment
.
 
<EOS>
About
midnight
we
shipped
a
sea
,
which
forced
its
way
through
the
skylights
,
<EOS>
burst
open
the
doors
above
,
and
came
raging
and
roaring
down
into
the
ladies
'
cabin
,
to
the
unspeakable
consternation
of
my
wife
and
a
little
Scotch
lady
---
who
,
by
the
way
,
had
previously
sent
a
message
to
the
captain
by
the
stewardess
,
requesting
him
,
with
her
compliments
,
to
have
a
steel
conductor
immediately
attached
to
the
top
of
every
mast
,
and
to
the
chimney
,
in
order
that
the
ship
might
not
be
struck
by
lightning
.
 
<EOS>
They
and
the
handmaid
before
mentioned
,
being
in
such
ecstasies
of
fear
<EOS>
that
I
scarcely
knew
what
to
do
with
them
,
I
naturally
bethought
myself
of
some
restorative
or
comfortable
cordial
;
and
nothing
better
occurring
to
me
,
at
the
moment
,
than
hot
brandy
-
and
-
water
<EOS>
,
I
procured
a
tumbler
full
without
delay
.
 
<EOS>
It
being
impossible
to
stand
or
sit
without
holding
on
,
they
were
all
heaped
together
in
one
corner
of
a
long
sofa
---
a
fixture
extending
entirely
across
the
cabin
---
where
they
clung
to
each
other
in
momentary
expectation
of
being
drowned
.
<EOS>
When
I
approached
this
place
with
my
specific
,
and
was
about
to
administer
it
with
many
consolatory
expressions
to
the
nearest
sufferer
,
what
was
my
dismay
to
see
them
all
roll
slowly
down
to
the
other
end
!
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
staggered
to
that
end
,
and
held
out
the
glass
once
more
,
how
immensely
baffled
were
my
good
intentions
by
the
ship
giving
another
lurch
,
and
their
all
rolling
back
again
!
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
dodged
them
up
and
down
this
sofa
for
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
without
reaching
them
once
;
and
by
the
time
I
did
catch
them
,
the
brandy
-
and
-
water
was
diminished
,
by
constant
spilling
,
to
a
teaspoonful
.
 
<EOS>
To
complete
the
group
,
it
is
necessary
to
recognise
in
this
disconcerted
dodger
,
an
individual
very
pale
from
sea
-
sickness
,
who
had
shaved
his
beard
and
brushed
his
hair
,
last
,
at
Liverpool
:
 
and
<EOS>
whose
only
article
of
dress
(
linen
not
included
)
were
a
pair
of
dreadnought
trousers
;
a
blue
jacket
,
formerly
admired
upon
the
Thames
at
Richmond
;
no
stockings
;
and
one
slipper
.
   
<EOS>
Of
the
outrageous
antics
performed
by
that
ship
next
morning
;
which
made
bed
a
practical
joke
,
and
getting
up
,
by
any
process
short
of
falling
out
,
an
impossibility
;
I
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
But
anything
like
the
utter
dreariness
and
desolation
that
met
my
eyes
when
I
literally
"
tumbled
up
"
on
deck
at
noon
,
I
never
saw
.
 
<EOS>
Ocean
and
sky
were
all
of
one
dull
,
heavy
,
uniform
,
lead
colour
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
extent
of
prospect
even
over
the
dreary
waste
that
lay
around
us
,
for
the
sea
ran
high
,
and
the
horizon
encompassed
us
like
a
large
black
hoop
.
 
<EOS>
Viewed
from
the
air
,
or
some
tall
bluff
on
shore
,
it
would
have
been
imposing
and
stupendous
,
no
doubt
;
but
seen
from
the
wet
and
rolling
decks
,
it
only
impressed
one
giddily
and
painfully
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
gale
of
last
night
the
life
-
boat
had
been
crushed
by
one
blow
of
the
sea
like
a
walnut
-
shell
;
and
there
it
hung
dangling
in
the
air
:
 
a
mere
faggot
of
crazy
boards
.
 
<EOS>
The
planking
of
the
paddle
-
boxes
had
been
torn
sheer
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
wheels
were
exposed
and
bare
;
and
they
whirled
and
dashed
their
spray
about
the
decks
at
random
.
 
<EOS>
Chimney
,
white
with
crusted
salt
<EOS>
;
topmasts
struck
;
storm
-
sails
set
;
rigging
all
knotted
,
tangled
,
wet
,
and
drooping
:
 
a
gloomier
picture
it
would
be
hard
to
look
upon
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
now
comfortably
established
by
courtesy
in
the
ladies
'
cabin
,
<EOS>
where
,
besides
ourselves
,
there
were
only
four
other
passengers
.
<EOS>
First
,
the
little
Scotch
lady
before
mentioned
,
on
her
way
to
join
her
husband
at
New
York
,
who
had
settled
there
three
years
before
.
<EOS>
Secondly
and
thirdly
,
an
honest
young
Yorkshireman
,
connected
with
some
American
house
;
domiciled
in
that
same
city
,
and
carrying
thither
his
beautiful
young
wife
to
whom
he
had
been
married
but
a
fortnight
,
and
who
was
the
fairest
specimen
of
a
comely
English
country
girl
I
have
ever
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Fourthly
,
fifthly
,
and
lastly
,
another
couple
:
 
newly
married
too
,
if
one
might
judge
from
the
endearments
they
frequently
interchanged
:
 
of
whom
I
know
no
more
than
that
they
were
rather
a
mysterious
,
run
-
away
kind
of
couple
;
that
the
lady
had
great
personal
attractions
also
;
and
that
the
gentleman
carried
more
guns
with
him
than
Robinson
Crusoe
,
wore
a
shooting
-
coat
,
and
had
two
great
dogs
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
On
further
consideration
,
I
remember
that
he
tried
hot
roast
pig
and
bottled
ale
as
a
cure
for
sea
-
sickness
;
and
that
he
took
these
remedies
(
usually
in
bed
)
day
after
day
,
with
astonishing
perseverance
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
add
,
for
the
information
of
the
curious
,
that
they
decidedly
failed
.
   
<EOS>
The
weather
continuing
obstinately
and
almost
unprecedentedly
bad
,
we
usually
straggled
into
this
cabin
,
more
or
less
faint
and
miserable
,
about
an
hour
before
noon
,
and
lay
down
on
the
sofas
to
recover
;
during
which
interval
,
the
captain
would
look
in
to
communicate
the
state
of
the
wind
,
the
moral
certainty
of
its
changing
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
(
the
weather
is
always
going
to
improve
to
-
morrow
,
at
sea
)
,
the
vessel
's
rate
of
sailing
,
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
Observations
there
were
none
to
tell
us
of
,
for
there
was
no
sun
to
take
them
by
.
 
<EOS>
But
a
description
of
one
day
will
serve
for
all
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Here
it
is
.
   
<EOS>
The
captain
being
gone
,
we
compose
ourselves
to
read
,
if
the
place
be
light
enough
;
and
if
not
,
we
doze
and
talk
alternately
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
,
a
bell
rings
,
and
the
stewardess
comes
down
with
a
steaming
dish
of
baked
potatoes
,
and
another
of
roasted
apples
;
and
plates
of
pig
's
face
,
cold
ham
,
salt
beef
;
or
perhaps
a
smoking
mess
of
rare
hot
collops
.
 
<EOS>
We
fall
to
upon
these
dainties
;
eat
as
much
as
we
can
(
we
have
great
appetites
now
)
;
and
are
as
long
as
possible
about
it
.
<EOS>
If
the
fire
will
burn
(
it
WILL
sometimes
)
<EOS>
we
are
pretty
cheerful
.
<EOS>
If
it
wo
n't
,
we
all
remark
to
each
other
that
it
's
very
cold
,
rub
our
hands
,
cover
ourselves
with
coats
and
cloaks
,
and
lie
down
again
to
doze
,
talk
,
and
read
(
provided
as
aforesaid
)
,
until
dinner
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
At
five
,
another
bell
rings
,
and
the
stewardess
reappears
with
another
dish
of
potatoes
---
boiled
this
time
---
and
store
of
hot
meat
of
various
kinds
:
 
not
forgetting
the
roast
pig
,
to
be
taken
medicinally
.
 
<EOS>
We
sit
down
at
table
again
(
rather
more
cheerfully
than
before
)
;
prolong
the
meal
with
a
rather
mouldy
dessert
of
apples
,
grapes
,
and
oranges
;
and
drink
our
wine
and
brandy
-
and
-
water
.
 
<EOS>
The
bottles
and
glasses
are
still
upon
the
table
,
and
the
oranges
and
so
forth
are
rolling
about
according
to
their
fancy
and
the
ship
's
way
,
when
the
doctor
comes
down
,
by
special
nightly
invitation
,
to
join
our
evening
rubber
:
immediately
on
whose
arrival
we
make
a
party
at
whist
,
and
as
it
is
a
rough
night
and
the
cards
will
not
lie
on
the
cloth
,
we
put
the
tricks
in
our
pockets
as
we
take
them
.
 
<EOS>
At
whist
we
remain
with
exemplary
gravity
(
deducting
a
short
time
for
tea
and
toast
)
until
eleven
o'clock
,
or
thereabouts
;
when
the
captain
comes
down
again
,
in
a
sou'-wester
hat
tied
under
his
chin
,
and
a
pilot
-
coat
:
 
making
the
ground
wet
where
he
stands
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
card
-
playing
is
over
,
and
the
bottles
and
glasses
are
again
upon
the
table
;
and
after
an
hour
's
pleasant
conversation
about
the
ship
,
the
passengers
,
and
things
in
general
,
the
captain
(
who
never
goes
to
bed
,
and
is
never
out
of
humour
)
turns
up
his
coat
collar
for
the
deck
again
;
shakes
hands
all
round
;
and
goes
laughing
out
into
the
weather
as
merrily
as
to
a
birthday
party
.
   
<EOS>
As
to
daily
news
,
there
is
no
dearth
of
that
commodity
.
 
<EOS>
This
passenger
is
reported
to
have
lost
fourteen
pounds
at
Vingt
-
et
-
un
in
the
saloon
yesterday
;
and
that
passenger
drinks
his
bottle
of
champagne
every
day
,
and
how
he
does
it
(
being
only
a
clerk
)
,
nobody
knows
.
 
<EOS>
The
head
engineer
has
distinctly
said
that
there
never
was
such
times
---
meaning
weather
---
and
four
good
hands
are
ill
,
and
have
given
in
,
dead
beat
.
 
<EOS>
Several
berths
are
full
of
water
,
and
all
the
cabins
are
leaky
.
 
<EOS>
The
ship
's
cook
,
secretly
swigging
damaged
whiskey
,
has
been
found
drunk
;
and
has
been
played
upon
by
the
fire
-
engine
until
quite
sober
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
stewards
have
fallen
down
-
stairs
at
various
dinner
-
times
,
and
go
about
with
plasters
in
various
places
.
 
<EOS>
The
baker
is
ill
,
and
so
is
the
pastry
-
cook
.
 
<EOS>
A
new
man
,
horribly
indisposed
,
has
been
required
to
fill
the
place
of
the
latter
officer
;
and
has
been
propped
and
jammed
up
with
empty
casks
in
a
little
house
upon
deck
,
and
commanded
to
roll
out
pie
-
crust
,
which
he
protests
(
being
highly
bilious
)
<EOS>
it
is
death
to
him
to
look
at
.
 
<EOS>
News
!
 
<EOS>
A
dozen
murders
on
shore
would
lack
the
interest
of
these
slight
incidents
at
sea
.
   
<EOS>
Divided
between
our
rubber
and
such
topics
as
these
,
we
were
running
(
as
we
thought
)
into
Halifax
Harbour
,
on
the
fifteenth
night
,
with
little
wind
and
a
bright
moon
---
indeed
,
we
had
made
the
Light
at
its
outer
entrance
,
and
put
the
pilot
in
charge
---
when
suddenly
the
ship
struck
upon
a
bank
of
mud
.
 
<EOS>
An
immediate
rush
on
deck
took
place
of
course
;
the
sides
were
crowded
in
an
instant
;
and
for
a
few
minutes
we
were
in
as
lively
a
state
of
confusion
as
the
greatest
lover
of
disorder
would
desire
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
The
passengers
,
and
guns
,
and
water
-
casks
,
and
other
heavy
matters
,
being
all
huddled
together
<EOS>
aft
,
however
,
to
lighten
her
in
the
head
,
she
was
soon
got
off
;
and
after
some
driving
on
towards
an
uncomfortable
line
of
objects
(
whose
vicinity
had
been
announced
very
early
in
the
disaster
by
a
loud
cry
of
"
Breakers
a
-
head
!
"
)
and
much
backing
of
paddles
,
and
heaving
of
the
lead
into
a
constantly
decreasing
depth
of
water
,
we
dropped
anchor
in
a
strange
outlandish
-
looking
nook
which
nobody
on
board
could
recognise
,
although
there
was
land
all
about
us
,
and
so
close
that
we
could
plainly
see
the
waving
branches
of
the
trees
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
strange
enough
,
in
the
silence
of
midnight
,
and
the
dead
stillness
that
seemed
to
be
created
by
the
sudden
and
unexpected
stoppage
of
the
engine
which
had
been
clanking
and
blasting
in
our
ears
incessantly
for
so
many
days
,
to
watch
the
look
of
blank
astonishment
expressed
in
every
face
:
 
beginning
with
the
officers
,
tracing
it
through
all
the
passengers
,
and
descending
to
the
very
stokers
and
furnacemen
,
who
emerged
from
below
,
one
by
one
,
and
clustered
together
in
a
smoky
group
about
the
hatchway
of
the
engine
-
room
,
comparing
notes
in
whispers
.
 
<EOS>
After
throwing
up
a
few
rockets
and
firing
signal
guns
in
the
hope
of
being
hailed
from
the
land
,
or
at
least
of
seeing
a
light
---
but
without
any
other
sight
or
sound
presenting
itself
---
it
was
determined
to
send
a
boat
on
shore
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
amusing
to
observe
how
very
kind
some
of
the
passengers
were
,
in
volunteering
to
go
ashore
in
this
same
boat
:
for
the
general
good
,
of
course
:
 
not
by
any
means
because
they
thought
the
ship
in
an
unsafe
position
,
or
contemplated
the
possibility
of
her
heeling
over
in
case
the
tide
were
running
out
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
less
amusing
to
remark
how
desperately
unpopular
the
poor
pilot
became
in
one
short
minute
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
had
his
passage
out
from
Liverpool
,
and
during
the
whole
voyage
had
been
quite
a
notorious
character
,
as
a
teller
of
anecdotes
and
cracker
of
jokes
.
<EOS>
Yet
here
were
the
very
men
who
had
laughed
the
loudest
at
his
jests
,
now
flourishing
their
fists
in
his
face
,
loading
him
with
imprecations
,
and
defying
him
to
his
teeth
as
a
villain
!
   
<EOS>
The
boat
soon
shoved
off
,
with
a
lantern
and
sundry
blue
lights
on
board
;
and
in
less
than
an
hour
returned
;
the
officer
in
command
bringing
with
him
a
tolerably
tall
young
tree
,
which
he
had
plucked
up
by
the
roots
,
to
satisfy
certain
distrustful
passengers
whose
minds
misgave
them
that
they
were
to
be
imposed
upon
and
shipwrecked
,
and
who
would
on
no
other
terms
believe
that
he
had
been
ashore
,
or
had
done
anything
but
fraudulently
row
a
little
way
into
the
mist
,
specially
to
deceive
them
and
compass
their
deaths
.
<EOS>
Our
captain
had
foreseen
from
the
first
that
we
must
be
in
a
place
called
the
Eastern
passage
;
and
so
we
were
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
about
the
last
place
in
the
world
in
which
we
had
any
business
or
reason
to
be
,
but
a
sudden
fog
,
and
some
error
on
the
pilot
's
part
,
were
the
cause
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
surrounded
by
banks
,
and
rocks
,
and
shoals
of
all
kinds
,
but
had
happily
drifted
,
it
seemed
,
upon
the
only
safe
speck
that
was
to
be
found
thereabouts
.
 
<EOS>
Eased
by
this
report
,
and
by
the
assurance
that
the
tide
was
past
the
ebb
,
we
turned
in
at
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
dressing
about
half
-
past
nine
next
day
,
when
the
noise
above
hurried
me
on
deck
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
had
left
it
overnight
,
it
was
dark
,
foggy
,
and
damp
,
and
there
were
bleak
hills
<EOS>
all
round
us
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
we
were
gliding
down
a
smooth
,
broad
stream
,
at
the
rate
of
eleven
miles
an
hour
:
 
our
colours
flying
gaily
;
our
crew
rigged
out
in
their
smartest
clothes
;
our
officers
in
uniform
again
;
the
sun
shining
as
on
a
brilliant
April
day
in
England
;
the
land
stretched
out
on
either
side
,
streaked
with
light
patches
of
snow
;
white
wooden
houses
;
people
at
their
doors
;
telegraphs
working
;
flags
hoisted
;
wharfs
appearing
;
ships
;
<EOS>
quays
crowded
with
people
;
distant
noises
;
shouts
;
men
and
boys
running
down
steep
places
towards
the
pier
:
 
all
more
bright
and
gay
and
fresh
to
our
unused
eyes
than
words
can
paint
them
.
 
<EOS>
We
came
to
a
wharf
,
paved
with
uplifted
faces
;
got
alongside
,
and
were
made
fast
,
after
some
shouting
and
straining
of
cables
;
darted
,
a
score
of
us
along
the
gangway
,
almost
as
soon
as
it
was
thrust
out
to
meet
us
,
and
before
it
had
reached
the
ship
---
and
leaped
upon
the
firm
glad
earth
again
!
   
<EOS>
I
suppose
this
Halifax
would
have
appeared
an
Elysium
,
though
it
had
been
a
curiosity
of
ugly
dulness
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
carried
away
with
me
a
most
pleasant
impression
of
the
town
and
its
inhabitants
,
and
have
preserved
it
to
this
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
without
regret
that
I
came
home
,
without
having
found
an
opportunity
of
returning
thither
,
and
once
more
shaking
hands
with
the
friends
I
made
that
day
.
   
<EOS>
It
happened
to
be
the
opening
of
the

General
Assembly

at
which
ceremonial
the
forms
observed
on
the
commencement
of
a
new
Session
of
Parliament
in
England
were
so
closely
copied
,
and
so
gravely
presented
on
a
small
scale
,
that
it
was
like
looking

Westminster
through

The
governor
,
as
her
Majesty
's
representative
,
delivered
what
may
be
called
the
Speech
from
the
Throne
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
what
he
had
to
say
manfully
and
well
.
 
<EOS>
The
military
band
outside
the
building
struck
up
"
God
save
the
Queen
"
with
great
vigour
before
his
Excellency
had
quite
finished
;
the
people
shouted
;
the
in
's
rubbed
their
hands
;
the
out
's
shook
their
heads
;
the
Government
party
said
there
never
was
such
a
good
speech
;
the
Opposition
declared
there
never
was
such
a
bad
one
;
the
Speaker
and
members
of
the
House
of
Assembly
withdrew
from
the
bar
to
say
a
great
deal
among
themselves
and
do
a
little
:
 
and
,
in
short
,
everything
went
on
,
and
promised
to
go
on
,
just
as
it
does
at
home
upon
the
like
occasions
.

The
town
is
built
on
the
side
of
a
hill
,
the
highest
point
being
commanded
by
a
strong
fortress
,
not
yet
quite
finished

<EOS>
Several
streets
of
good
breadth
and
appearance
extend
from
its
summit
to
the
water
-
side
,
and
are
intersected
by
cross
streets
running
parallel
with
the
river

<EOS>
The
houses
are
chiefly
of
wood
.

The

is
abundantly
supplied

and
provisions
are
exceedingly
cheap

<EOS>
The
weather
being
unusually
mild
at
that
time
for
the
season
of
the
year
,
there
was
no
sleighing
:
 
but
there
were
plenty
of
those
vehicles
in
yards
and
by
-
places
,
and
some
of
them
,
from
the
gorgeous
quality
of
their
decorations
,
might
have
"
gone
on
"
without
alteration
as
triumphal
cars
in
a
melodrama
at
Astley

<EOS>
The
day
was
uncommonly
fine
;
the
air
bracing
and
healthful
;
the
whole
aspect
of
the
town
cheerful
,
thriving
,
and
industrious
.
   
<EOS>
We
lay
there
seven
hours
,
to
deliver
and
exchange
the
mails
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
having
collected
all
our
bags
and
all
our
passengers
(
including
two
or
three
choice
spirits
,
who
,
having
indulged
too
freely
in
oysters
and
champagne
,
were
found
lying
insensible
on
their
backs
in
unfrequented
streets
)
,
the
engines
were
again
put
in
motion
,
and
we
stood
off
for
Boston
.
   
<EOS>
Encountering
squally
weather
again
in
the
Bay
of
Fundy
,
we
tumbled
and
rolled
about
as
usual
all
that
night
and
all
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
next
afternoon
,
that
is
to
say
,
on
Saturday
,
the
twenty
-
second
of
January
,
an
American
pilot
-
boat
came
alongside
,
and
soon
afterwards
the
Britannia
steam
-
packet
,
from
Liverpool
,
eighteen
days
out
,
was
telegraphed
at
Boston
.
   
<EOS>
The
indescribable
interest
with
which
I
strained
my
eyes
,
as
the
first
patches
of
American
soil
peeped
like
molehills
from
the
green
sea
,
and
followed
them
,
as
they
swelled
,
by
slow
and
almost
imperceptible
degrees
,
into
a
continuous
line
of
coast
,
can
hardly
be
exaggerated
.
 
<EOS>
A
sharp
keen
wind
blew
dead
against
us
;
a
hard
frost
prevailed
on
shore
;
and
the
cold
was
most
severe
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
the
air
was
so
intensely
clear
,
and
dry
,
and
bright
,
that
the
temperature
was
not
only
endurable
,
but
delicious
.
   
<EOS>
How
I
remained
on
deck
,
staring
about
me
,
until
we
came
alongside
the
dock
,
and
how
,
though
I
had
had
as
many
eyes
as
Argus
,
I
should
have
had
them
all
wide
open
,
and
all
employed
on
new
objects
---
are
topics
which
I
will
not
prolong
this
chapter
to
discuss
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
will
I
more
than
hint
at
my
foreigner
-
like
mistake
in
supposing
that
a
party
of
most
active
persons
,
who
scrambled
on
board
at
the
peril
of
their
lives
as
we
approached
the
wharf
,
were
newsmen
,
answering
to
that
industrious
class
at
home
;
whereas
,
despite
the
leathern
wallets
of
news
slung
about
the
necks
of
some
,
and
the
broad
sheets
in
the
hands
of
all
,
they
were
Editors
,
who
boarded
ships
in
person
(
as
one
gentleman
in
a
worsted
comforter
informed
me
)
,
"
because
they
liked
the
excitement
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Suffice
it
in
this
place
to
say
,
that
one
of
these
invaders
,
with
a
ready
courtesy
for
which
I
thank
him
here
most
gratefully
,
went
on
before
to
order
rooms
at
the
hotel
;
and
that
when
I
followed
,
as
I
soon
did
,
I
found
myself
rolling
through
the
long
passages
with
an
involuntary
imitation
of
the
gait
of
Mr
T
P
Cooke
,
in
a
new
nautical
melodrama
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dinner
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
I
to
the
waiter
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
?
"
said
the
waiter
.
   
<EOS>
"
As
quick
as
possible
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Right
away
?
"
said
the
waiter
.
   
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
I
answered
"
No
,
"
at
hazard
.
   
<EOS>
"
NOT
right
away
?
"
cried
the
waiter
,
with
an
amount
of
surprise
that
made
me
start
.
   
<EOS>
I
looked
at
him
doubtfully
,
and
returned
,
"
<EOS>
No
;
I
would
rather
have
it
in
this
private
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
it
very
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
,
I
really
thought
the
waiter
must
have
gone
out
of
his
mind
:
 
as
I
believe
he
would
have
done
,
but
for
the
interposition
of
another
man
,
who
whispered
in
his
ear
,
"
Directly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
and
that
's
a
fact
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
waiter
,
looking
helplessly
at
me
:
 
"
Right
away
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
saw
now
that
"
Right
away
"
and
"
Directly
"
were
one
and
the
same
thing
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
reversed
my
previous
answer
,
and
sat
down
to
dinner
in
ten
minutes
afterwards
;
and
a
capital
dinner
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
The
hotel
(
a
very
excellent
one
)
is
called
the
Tremont
House
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
more
galleries
,
colonnades
,
piazzas
,
and
passages
than
I
can
remember
,
or
the
reader
would
believe

Chapter

<EOS>
Boston
 
<EOS>
IN
all
the
public
establishments
of
America
,
the
utmost
courtesy
prevails
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
our
Departments
are
susceptible
of
considerable
improvement
in
this
respect
,
but
the
Custom
-
house
above
all
others
would
do
well
to
take
example
from
the
United
States
and
render
itself
somewhat
less
odious
and
offensive
to
foreigners
.
 
<EOS>
The
servile
rapacity
of
the
French
officials
is
sufficiently
contemptible
;
but
there
is
a
surly
boorish
incivility
about
our
men
,
alike
disgusting
to
all
persons
who
fall
into
their
hands
,
and
discreditable
to
the
nation
that
keeps
such
ill
-
conditioned
curs
snarling
about
its
gates
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
landed
in
America
,
I
could
not
help
being
strongly
impressed
with
the
contrast
their
Custom
-
house
presented
,
and
the
attention
,
politeness
and
good
humour
with
which
its
officers
discharged
their
duty
.
   
<EOS>
As
we
did
not
land
at
Boston
,
in
consequence
of
some
detention
at
the
wharf
,
until
after
dark
,
I
received
my
first
impressions
of
the
city
in
walking
down
to
the
Custom
-
house
on
the
morning
after
our
arrival
,
which
was
Sunday
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
to
say
,
by
the
way
,
how
many
offers
of
pews
and
seats
in
church
for
that
morning
were
made
to
us
,
by
formal
note
of
invitation
,
before
we
had
half
finished
our
first
dinner
in
America
,
but
if
I
may
be
allowed
to
make
a
moderate
guess
,
without
going
into
nicer
calculation
,
I
should
say
that
at
least
as
many
sittings
were
proffered
us
,
as
would
have
accommodated
a
score
or
two
of
grown
-
up
families
.
 
<EOS>
The
number
of
creeds
and
forms
of
religion
to
which
the
pleasure
of
our
company
was
requested
,
was
in
very
fair
proportion
.
   
<EOS>
Not
being
able
,
in
the
absence
of
any
change
of
clothes
,
to
go
to
church
that
day
,
we
were
compelled
to
decline
these
kindnesses
,
one
and
all
;
and
I
was
reluctantly
obliged
to
forego
the
delight
of
hearing
Dr.
Channing
,
who
happened
to
preach
that
morning
for
the
first
time
in
a
very
long
interval
.
 
<EOS>
I
mention
the
name
of
this
distinguished
and
accomplished
man
(
with
whom
I
soon
afterwards
had
the
pleasure
of
becoming
personally
acquainted
)
<EOS>
,
that
I
may
have
the
gratification
of
recording
my
humble
tribute
of
admiration
and
respect
for
his
high
abilities
and
character
;
and
for
the
bold
philanthropy
with
which
he
has
ever
opposed
himself
to
that
most
hideous
blot
and
foul
disgrace
---
Slavery
.
   
<EOS>
To
return
to
Boston
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
got
into
the
streets
upon
this
Sunday
morning
,
the
air
was
so
clear
,
the
houses
were
so
bright
and
gay
:
the
signboards
were
painted
in
such
gaudy
colours
;
the
gilded
letters
were
so
very
golden
;
the
bricks
were
so
very
red
,
the
stone
was
so
very
white
,
the
blinds
and
area
railings
were
so
very
green
,
the
knobs
and
plates
upon
the
street
doors
so
marvellously
bright
and
twinkling
;
and
all
so
slight
and
unsubstantial
in
appearance
---
that
every
thoroughfare
in
the
city
looked
exactly
like
a
scene
in
a
pantomime
.
 
<EOS>
It
rarely
happens
in
the
business
streets
that
a
tradesman
,
if
I
may
venture
to
call
anybody
a
tradesman
,
where
everybody
is
a
merchant
,
resides
above
his
store
;
so
that
many
occupations
are
often
carried
on
in
one
house
,
and
the
whole
front
is
covered
with
boards
and
inscriptions
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
walked
along
,
I
kept
glancing
up
at
these
boards
,
confidently
expecting
to
see
a
few
of
them
change
into
something
;
and
I
never
turned
a
corner
suddenly
without
looking
out
for
the
clown
and
pantaloon
,
who
,
I
had
no
doubt
,
were
hiding
in
a
doorway
or
behind
some
pillar
close
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
Harlequin
and
Columbine
,
I
discovered
immediately
that
they
lodged
(
they
are
always
looking
after
lodgings
in
a
pantomime
)
at
a
very
small
clockmaker
's
one
story
high
,
near
the
hotel
;
which
,
in
addition
to
various
symbols
and
devices
,
almost
covering
the
whole
front
,
had
a
great
dial
hanging
out
---
to
be
jumped
through
,
of
course
.
   
<EOS>
The
suburbs
are
,
if
possible
,
even
more
unsubstantial
-
looking
than
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
The
white
wooden
houses
<EOS>
(
so
white
that
it
makes
one
wink
to
look
at
them
)
,
with
their
green
jalousie
blinds
,
are
so
sprinkled
and
dropped
about
in
all
directions
,
without
seeming
to
have
any
root
at
all
in
the
ground
;
and
the
small
churches
and
chapels
are
so
prim
,
and
bright
,
and
highly
varnished
;
that
I
almost
believed
the
whole
affair
could
be
taken
up
piecemeal
like
a
child
's
toy
,
and
crammed
into
a
little
box
.
   
<EOS>
The
city
is
a
beautiful
one
,
and
can
not
fail
,
I
should
imagine
,
to
impress
all
strangers
very
favourably
.
 
<EOS>
The
private
dwelling
-
houses
are
,
for
the
most
part
,
large
and
elegant
;
the
shops
extremely
good
;
and
the
public
buildings
handsome
.
 
<EOS>
The
State
House
is
built
upon
the
summit
of
a
hill
,
which
rises
gradually
at
first
,
and
afterwards
by
a
steep
ascent
,
almost
from
the
water
's
edge
.
 
<EOS>
In
front
is
a
green
enclosure
,
called
the
Common
.
 
<EOS>
The
site
is
beautiful
:
 
and
from
the
top
there
is
a
charming
panoramic
view
of
the
whole
town
and
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
In
addition
to
a
variety
of
commodious
offices
,
it
contains
two
handsome
chambers
;
in
one
the
House
of
Representatives
of
the
State
hold
their
meetings
:
 
in
the
other
,
the
Senate
.
 
<EOS>
Such
proceedings
as
I
saw
here
,
were
conducted
with
perfect
gravity
and
decorum
;
and
were
certainly
calculated
to
inspire
attention
and
respect
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
no
doubt
that
much
of
the
intellectual
refinement
and
superiority
of
Boston
,
is
referable
to
the
quiet
influence
of
the
University
of
Cambridge
,
which
is
within
three
or
four
miles
of
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
The
resident
professors
at
that
university
are
gentlemen
of
learning
and
varied
attainments
;
and
are
,
without
one
exception
that
I
can
call
to
mind
,
men
who
would
shed
a
grace
upon
,
and
do
honour
to
,
any
society
in
the
civilised
world
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
the
resident
gentry
in
Boston
and
its
neighbourhood
,
and
I
think
I
am
not
mistaken
in
adding
,
a
large
majority
of
those
who
are
attached
to
the
liberal
professions
there
,
have
been
educated
at
this
same
school
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
the
defects
of
American
universities
may
be
,
they
disseminate
no
prejudices
;
rear
no
bigots
;
dig
up
the
buried
ashes
of
no
old
superstitions
;
never
interpose
between
the
people
and
their
improvement
;
exclude
no
man
because
of
his
religious
opinions
;
above
all
,
in
their
whole
course
of
study
and
instruction
,
recognise
a
world
,
and
a
broad
one
too
,
lying
beyond
the
college
walls
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
source
of
inexpressible
pleasure
to
me
to
observe
the
almost
imperceptible
,
but
not
less
certain
effect
,
wrought
by
this
institution
among
the
small
community
of
Boston
;
and
to
note
at
every
turn
the
humanising
tastes
and
desires
it
has
engendered
;
<EOS>
the
affectionate
friendships
to
which
it
has
given
rise
;
the
amount
of
vanity
and
prejudice
it
has
dispelled
.
 
<EOS>
The
golden
calf
they
worship
at
Boston
is
a
pigmy
compared
with
the
giant
effigies
set
up
in
other
parts
of
that
vast
counting
-
house
which
lies
beyond
the
Atlantic
;
and
the
almighty
dollar
sinks
into
something
comparatively
insignificant
,
amidst
a
whole
Pantheon
of
better
gods
.
   
<EOS>
Above
all
,
I
sincerely
believe
that
the
public
institutions
and
charities
of
this
capital
of
Massachusetts
are
as
nearly
perfect
,
as
the
most
considerate
wisdom
,
benevolence
,
and
humanity
,
can
make
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
in
my
life
was
more
affected
by
the
contemplation
of
happiness
,
under
circumstances
of
privation
and
bereavement
,
than
in
my
visits
to
these
establishments
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
and
pleasant
feature
of
all
such
institutions
in
America
,
that
they
are
either
supported
by
the
State
or
assisted
by
the
State
;
or
(
in
the
event
of
their
not
needing
its
helping
hand
)
that
they
act
in
concert
with
it
,
and
are
emphatically
the
people
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
think
,
with
a
view
to
the
principle
and
its
tendency
to
elevate
or
depress
the
character
of
the
industrious
classes
,
that
a
Public
Charity
is
immeasurably
better
than
a
Private
Foundation
,
no
matter
how
munificently
the
latter
may
be
endowed
.
 
<EOS>
In
our
own
country
,
where
it
has
not
,
until
within
these
later
days
,
been
a
very
popular
fashion
with
governments
to
display
any
extraordinary
regard
for
the
great
mass
of
the
people
or
to
recognise
their
existence
as
improvable
creatures
,
private
charities
,
unexampled
in
the
history
of
the
earth
,
have
arisen
,
to
do
an
incalculable
amount
of
good
among
the
destitute
and
afflicted
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
government
of
the
country
,
having
neither
act
nor
part
in
them
,
is
not
in
the
receipt
of
any
portion
of
the
gratitude
they
inspire
;
and
,
offering
very
little
shelter
or
relief
beyond
that
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
workhouse
and
the
jail
,
has
come
,
not
unnaturally
,
to
be
looked
upon
by
the
poor
rather
as
a
stern
master
,
quick
to
correct
and
punish
,
than
a
kind
protector
,
merciful
and
vigilant
in
their
hour
of
need
.
   
<EOS>
The
maxim
that
out
of
evil
cometh
good
,
is
strongly
illustrated
by
these
establishments
at
home
;
as
the
records
of
the
Prerogative
Office
in
Doctors
'
Commons
can
abundantly
prove
.
 
<EOS>
Some
immensely
rich
old
gentleman
or
lady
,
surrounded
by
needy
relatives
,
makes
,
upon
a
low
average
,
a
will
a
-
week
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
or
lady
,
never
very
remarkable
in
the
best
of
times
for
good
temper
,
is
full
of
aches
and
pains
from
head
to
foot
;
full
of
fancies
and
caprices
;
full
of
spleen
,
distrust
,
suspicion
,
and
dislike
.
 
<EOS>
To
cancel
old
wills
,
and
invent
new
ones
,
is
at
last
the
sole
business
of
such
a
testator
's
existence
;
and
relations
and
friends
<EOS>
(
some
of
whom
have
been
bred
up
distinctly
to
inherit
a
large
share
of
the
property
,
and
have
been
,
from
their
cradles
,
specially
disqualified
from
devoting
themselves
to
any
useful
pursuit
,
on
that
account
)
<EOS>
are
so
often
and
so
unexpectedly
and
summarily
cut
off
,
and
reinstated
,
and
cut
off
again
,
that
the
whole
family
,
down
to
the
remotest
cousin
,
is
kept
in
a
perpetual
fever
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
it
becomes
plain
that
the
old
lady
or
gentleman
has
not
long
to
live
;
and
the
plainer
this
becomes
,
the
more
clearly
the
old
lady
or
gentleman
perceives
that
everybody
is
in
a
conspiracy
against
their
poor
old
dying
relative
;
wherefore
the
old
lady
or
gentleman
makes
another
last
will
---
positively
the
last
this
time
---
conceals
the
same
in
a
china
teapot
,
and
expires
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
Then
it
turns
out
,
that
the
whole
of
the
real
and
personal
estate
is
divided
between
half
-
a
-
dozen
charities
;
and
that
the
dead
and
gone
testator
has
in
pure
spite
helped
to
do
a
great
deal
of
good
,
at
the
cost
of
an
immense
amount
of
evil
passion
and
misery
.

The
Perkins
Institution
and
Massachusetts
Asylum
for
the
Blind
,
at
Boston
,
is
superintended
by
a
body
of
trustees
who
make
an
annual
report
to
the
corporation
.
 
<EOS>
The
indigent
blind
of
that
state
are
admitted
gratuitously
.
 
<EOS>
Those
from
the
adjoining
state
of
Connecticut
,
or
from
the
states
of
Maine
,
Vermont
,
or
New
Hampshire
,
are
admitted
by
a
warrant
from
the
state
to
which
they
respectively
belong
;
or
,
failing
that
,
must
find
security
among
their
friends
,
for
the
payment
of
about
twenty
pounds
English
for
their
first
year
's
board
and
instruction
,
and
ten
for
the
second

<EOS>
After
the
first
year
,
"
say
the
trustees
,
"
an
account
current
will
be
opened
with
each
pupil
;
he
will
be
charged
with
the
actual
cost
of
his
board
,
which
will
not
exceed
two
dollars
per
week
;
"
a
trifle
more
than
eight
shillings
English
;
"
and
he
will
be
credited
with
the
amount
paid
for
him
by
the
state
,
or
by
his
friends
;
also
with
his
earnings
over
and
above
the
cost
of
the
stock
which
he
uses
;
so
that
all
his
earnings
over
one
dollar
per
week
will
be
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
third
year
it
will
be
known
whether
his
earnings
will
more
than
pay
the
actual
cost
of
his
board
;
if
they
should
,
he
will
have
it
at
his
option
to
remain
and
receive
his
earnings
,
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
prove
unable
to
earn
their
own
livelihood
will
not
be
retained
;
as
it
is
not
desirable
to
convert
the
establishment
into
an
alms
-
house
,
or
to
retain
any
but
working
bees
in
the
hive
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
by
physical
or
mental
imbecility
are
disqualified
from

are
thereby
disqualified
from
being

community
;
and
they
can
be
better
provided
for
in
establishments
fitted
for
the
infirm

<EOS>
I
went
to
see
this
place
<EOS>
one
very
fine
winter
morning
:
 
an
Italian
sky
above
,
and
the
air
so
clear
and
bright
on
every
side
,
that
even
my
eyes
,
which
are
none
of
the
best
,
could
follow
the
minute
lines
and
scraps
of
tracery
in
distant
buildings
.
 
<EOS>
Like
most
other
public
institutions
in
America
,
of
the
same
class
,
it
stands
a
mile
or
two
without
the
town
,
in
a
cheerful
healthy
spot
;
and
is
an
airy
,
spacious
,
handsome
edifice
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
built
upon
a
height
,
commanding
the
harbour
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
paused
for
a
moment
at
the
door
,
and
marked
how
fresh
and
free
the
whole
scene
was
---
<EOS>
what
sparkling
bubbles
glanced
upon
the
waves
,
and
welled
up
every
moment
to
the
surface
,
as
though
the
world
below
,
like
that
above
,
were
radiant
with
the
bright
day
,
and
gushing
over
in
its
fulness
of
light
:
 
when
I
gazed
from
sail
to
sail
away
upon
a
ship
at
sea
,
a
tiny
speck
of
shining
white
,
the
only
cloud
upon
the
still
,
deep
,
distant
blue
---
and
,
turning
,
saw
a
blind
boy
with
his
sightless
face
addressed
that
way
,
as
though
he
too
had
some
sense
within
him
of
the
glorious
distance
:
 
<EOS>
I
felt
a
kind
of
sorrow
that
the
place
should
be
so
very
light
,
and
a
strange
wish
that
for
his
sake
it
were
darker
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
but
momentary
,
of
course
,
and
a
mere
fancy
,
but
I
felt
it
keenly
for
all
that
.
   
<EOS>
The
children
were
at
their
daily
tasks
in
different
rooms
,
except
a
few
who
were
already
dismissed
,
and
were
at
play
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
as
in
many
institutions
,
no
uniform
is
worn
;
and
I
was
very
glad
of
it
,
for
two
reasons
.
 
<EOS>
Firstly
,
because
I
am
sure
that
nothing
but
senseless
custom
and
want
of
thought
would
reconcile
us
to
the
liveries
and
badges
we
are
so
fond
of
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
Secondly
,
because
the
absence
of
these
things
presents
each
child
to
the
visitor
in
his
or
her
own
proper
character
,
with
its
individuality
unimpaired
;
not
lost
in
a
dull
,
ugly
,
monotonous
repetition
of
the
same
unmeaning
garb
:
which
is
really
an
important
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
The
wisdom
of
encouraging
a
little
harmless
pride
in
personal
appearance
even
among
the
blind
,
or
the
whimsical
absurdity
of
considering
charity
and
leather
breeches
inseparable
companions
,
as
we
do
,
requires
no
comment
.
   
<EOS>
Good
order
,
cleanliness
,
and
comfort
,
pervaded
every
corner
of
the
building
.
 
<EOS>
The
various
classes
,
who
were
gathered
round
their
teachers
,
answered
the
questions
put
to
them
with
readiness
and
intelligence
,
and
in
a
spirit
of
cheerful
contest
for
precedence
which
pleased
me
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
were
at
play
,
were
gleesome
and
noisy
as
other
children
.
 
<EOS>
More
spiritual
and
affectionate
friendships
appeared
to
exist
among
them
,
than
would
be
found
among
other
young
persons
suffering
under
no
deprivation
;
but
this
I
expected
and
was
prepared
to
find
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
part
of
the
great
scheme
of
Heaven
's
merciful
consideration
for
the
afflicted
.
   
<EOS>
In
a
portion
of
the
building
,
set
apart
for
that
purpose
,
are
workshops
for
blind
persons
whose
education
is
finished
,
and
who
have
acquired
a
trade
,
but
who
can
not
pursue
it
in
an
ordinary
manufactory
because
of
their
deprivation
.
 
<EOS>
Several
people
were
at
work
here
;
making
brushes
,
mattresses
,
and
so
forth
;
and
the
cheerfulness
,
industry
,
and
good
order
discernible
in
every
other
part
of
the
building
,
extended
to
this
department
also
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
ringing
of
a
bell
,
the
pupils
all
repaired
,
without
any
guide
or
leader
,
to
a
spacious
music
-
hall
,
where
they
took
their
seats
in
an
orchestra
erected
for
that
purpose
,
and
listened
with
manifest
delight
to
a
voluntary
on
the
organ
,
played
by
one
of
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
At
its
conclusion
,
the
performer
,
a
boy
of
nineteen
or
twenty
,
gave
place
to
a
girl
;
and
to
her
accompaniment
they
all
sang
a
hymn
,
and
afterwards
a
sort
of
chorus
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
sad
to
look
upon
and
hear
them
,
happy
though
their
condition
unquestionably
was
;
and
I
saw
that
one
blind
girl
,
who
(
being
for
the
time
deprived
of
the
use
of
her
limbs
,
by
illness
)
sat
close
beside
me
with
her
face
towards
them
,
wept
silently
the
while
she
listened
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
strange
to
watch
the
faces
of
the
blind
,
and
see
how
free
they
are
from
all
concealment
of
what
is
passing
in
their
thoughts
;
observing
which
,
a
man
with
eyes
may
blush
to
contemplate
the
mask
he
wears
.
 
<EOS>
Allowing
for
one
shade
of
anxious
expression
which
is
never
absent
from
their
countenances
,
and
the
like
of
which
we
may
readily
detect
in
our
own
faces
if
we
try
to
feel
our
way
in
the
dark
,
<EOS>
every
idea
,
as
it
rises
within
them
,
is
expressed
with
the
lightning
's
speed
and
nature
's
truth
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
company
at
a
rout
,
or
drawing
-
room
at
court
,
could
only
for
one
time
be
as
unconscious
of
the
eyes
upon
them
as
blind
men
and
women
are
,
what
secrets
would
come
out
,
and
what
a
worker
of
hypocrisy
this
sight
,
the
loss
of
which
we
so
much
pity
,
would
appear
to
be
!
   
<EOS>
The
thought
occurred
to
me
as
I
sat
down
in
another
room
,
before
a
girl
,
blind
,
deaf
,
and
dumb
;
destitute
of
smell
;
and
nearly
so
of
taste
:
 
before
a
fair
young
creature
with
every
human
faculty
,
and
hope
,
and
power
of
goodness
and
affection
,
inclosed
within
her
delicate
frame
,
and
but
one
outward
sense
---
the
sense
of
touch
.
<EOS>
There
she
was
,
before
me
;
built
up
,
as
it
were
,
in
a
marble
cell
,
impervious
to
any
ray
of
light
,
or
particle
of
sound
;
with
her
poor
white
hand
peeping
through
a
chink
in
the
wall
,
beckoning
to
some
good
man
for
help
,
that
an
Immortal
soul
might
be
awakened
.
   
<EOS>
Long
before
I
looked
upon
her
,
the
help
had
come
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
was
radiant
with
intelligence
and
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
Her
hair
,
braided
by
her
own
hands
,
was
bound
about
a
head
,
whose
intellectual
capacity
and
development
were
beautifully
expressed
in
its
graceful
outline
,
and
its
broad
open
brow
;
<EOS>
her
dress
,
arranged
by
herself
,
was
a
pattern
of
neatness
and
simplicity
;
the
work
she
had
knitted
,
lay
beside
her
;
her
writing
-
book
was
on
the
desk
she
leaned
upon
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
From
the
mournful
ruin
of
such
bereavement
,
there
had
slowly
risen
up
this
gentle
,
tender
,
guileless
,
grateful
-
hearted
being
.
   
<EOS>
Like
other
inmates
of
that
house
,
she
had
a
green
ribbon
bound
round
her
eyelids
.
 
<EOS>
A
doll
she
had
dressed
lay
near
upon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
it
up
,
and
saw
that
she
had
made
a
green
fillet
such
as
she
wore
herself
,
and
fastened
it
about
its
mimic
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
seated
in
a
little
enclosure
,
made
by
school
-
desks
and
forms
,
writing
her
daily
journal
.
 
<EOS>
But
soon
finishing
this
pursuit
,
she
engaged
in
an
animated
conversation
with
a
teacher
who
sat
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
a
favourite
mistress
with
the
poor
pupil
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
could
see
the
face
of
her
fair
instructress
,
she
would
not
love
her
less
,
I
am
sure
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
extracted
a
few
disjointed
fragments
of
her
history
,
from
an
account
,
written
by
that
one
man
who
has
made
her
what
she
is
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
very
beautiful
and
touching
narrative
;
and
I
wish
I
could
present
it
entire
.
   
<EOS>
Her
name
is
Laura
Bridgman
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
was
born
in
Hanover
,
New
Hampshire
,
on
the
twenty
-
first
of
December
,
1829
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
described
as
having
been
a
very
sprightly
and
pretty
infant
,
with
bright
blue
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
,
however
,
so
puny
and
feeble
until
she
was
a
year
and
a
half
old
,
that
her
parents
hardly
hoped
to
rear
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
subject
to
severe
fits
,
which
seemed
to
rack
her
frame
almost
beyond
her
power
of
endurance
:
 
and
<EOS>
life
was
held
by
the
feeblest
tenure
:
 
but
<EOS>
when
a
year
and
a
half
old
,
she
seemed
to
rally
;
the
dangerous
symptoms
subsided
;
and
at
twenty
months
old
,
she
was
perfectly
well
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
her
mental
powers
,
hitherto
stinted
in
their
growth
,
rapidly
developed
themselves
;
and
during
the
four
months
of
health
which
she
enjoyed
,
she
appears
(
making
due
allowance
for
a
fond
mother
's
account
)
to
have
displayed
a
considerable
degree
of
intelligence
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
suddenly
she
sickened
again
;
her
disease
raged
with
great
violence
during
five
weeks
,
when
her
eyes
and
ears
were
inflamed
,
suppurated
,
and
their
contents
were
discharged
.
 
<EOS>
But
though
sight
and
hearing
were
gone
for
ever
,
the
poor
child
's
sufferings
were
not
ended
.
 
<EOS>
The
fever
raged
during
seven
weeks
;
for
five
months
she
was
kept
in
bed
in
a
darkened
room
;
it
was
a
year
before
she
could
walk
unsupported
,
and
two
years
before
she
could
sit
up
all
day
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
observed
that
her
sense
of
smell
was
almost
entirely
destroyed
;
and
,
consequently
,
that
her
taste
was
much
blunted
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
until
four
years
of
age
that
the
poor
child
's
bodily
health
seemed
restored
,
and
she
was
able
to
enter
upon
her
apprenticeship
of
life
and
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
what
a
situation
was
hers
!
 
<EOS>
The
darkness
and
the
silence
of
the
tomb
were
around
her
:
 
no
mother
's
smile
called
forth
her
answering
smile
,
no
father
's
voice
taught
her
to
imitate
his
sounds
:
---
they
,
brothers
and
sisters
,
were
but
forms
of
matter
which
resisted
her
touch
,
but
which
differed
not
from
the
furniture
of
the
house
,
save
in
warmth
,
and
in
the
power
of
locomotion
;
and
not
even
in
these
respects
from
the
dog
and
the
cat
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
the
immortal
spirit
which
had
been
implanted
within
her
could
not
die
,
nor
be
maimed
nor
mutilated
;
and
though
most
of
its
avenues
of
communication
with
the
world
were
cut
off
,
it
began
to
manifest
itself
through
the
others
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
could
walk
,
she
began
to
explore
the
room
,
and
then
the
house
;
she
became
familiar
with
the
form
,
density
,
weight
,
and
heat
,
of
every
article
she
could
lay
her
hands
upon
.
 
<EOS>
She
followed
her
mother
,
and
felt
her
hands
and
arms
,
as
she
was
occupied
about
the
house
;
and
her
disposition
to
imitate
,
led
her
to
repeat
everything
herself
.
 
<EOS>
She
even
learned
to
sew
a
little
,
and
to
knit
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
reader
will
scarcely
need
to
be
told
,
however
,
that
the
opportunities
of
communicating
with
her
,
were
very
,
very
limited
;
and
that
the
moral
effects
of
her
wretched
state
soon
began
to
appear
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
can
not
be
enlightened
by
reason
,
can
only
be
controlled
by
force
;
and
this
,
coupled
with
her
great
privations
,
must
soon
have
reduced
her
to
a
worse
condition
than
that
of
the
beasts
that
perish
,
but
for
timely
and
unhoped
-
for
aid
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
this
time
,
I
was
so
fortunate
as
to
hear
of
the
child
,
and
immediately
hastened
to
Hanover
to
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
her
with
a
well
-
formed
figure
;
a
strongly
-
marked
,
nervous
-
sanguine
temperament
;
a
large
and
beautifully
-
shaped
head
;
and
the
whole
system
in
healthy
action
.
 
<EOS>
The
parents
were
easily
induced
to
consent
to
her
coming
to
Boston
,
and
on
the
4th
of
October
,
1837
,
they
brought
her
to
the
Institution
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
a
while
,
she
was
much
bewildered
;
and
after
waiting
about
two
weeks
,
until
she
became
acquainted
with
her
new
locality
,
and
somewhat
familiar
with
the
inmates
,
the
attempt
was
made
to
give
her
knowledge
of
arbitrary
signs
,
by
which
she
could
interchange
thoughts
with
others
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
was
one
of
two
ways
to
be
adopted
:
 
either
to
go
on
to
build
up
a
language
of
signs
on
the
basis
of
the
natural
language
which
she
had
already
commenced
herself
,
or
to
teach
her
the
purely
arbitrary
language
in
common
use
:
 
that
is
,
to
give
her
a
sign
for
every
individual
thing
,
or
to
give
her
a
knowledge
of
letters
by
combination
of
which
she
might
express
her
idea
of
the
existence
,
and
the
mode
and
condition
of
existence
,
of
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
The
former
would
have
been
easy
,
but
very
ineffectual
;
the
latter
seemed
very
difficult
,
but
,
if
accomplished
,
very
effectual
.
 
<EOS>
I
determined
therefore
to
try
the
latter
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
first
experiments
were
made
by
taking
articles
in
common
use
,
such
as
knives
,
forks
,
spoons
,
keys
,
&
c.
,
and
pasting
upon
them
labels
with
their
names
printed
in
raised
letters
.
 
<EOS>
These
<EOS>
she
felt
very
carefully
,
and
soon
,
of
course
,
distinguished
that
the
crooked
lines
SPOON
,
differed
as
much
from
the
crooked
lines
KEY
,
as
the
spoon
differed
from
the
key
in
form
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
small
detached
labels
,
with
the
same
words
printed
upon
them
,
were
put
into
her
hands
;
and
she
soon
observed
that
they
were
similar
to
the
ones
pasted
on
the
articles
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
showed
her
perception
of
this
similarity
by
laying
the
label
KEY
upon
the
key
,
and
the
label
SPOON
upon
the
spoon
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
encouraged
here
by
the
natural
sign
of
approbation
,
patting
on
the
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
same
process
was
then
repeated
with
all
the
articles
which
she
could
handle
;
and
she
very
easily
learned
to
place
the
proper
labels
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
evident
,
however
,
that
the
only
intellectual
exercise
was
that
of
imitation
and
memory
.
 
<EOS>
She
recollected
that
the
label
BOOK
was
placed
upon
a
book
,
and
she
repeated
the
process
first
from
imitation
,
next
from
memory
,
with
only
the
motive
of
love
of
approbation
,
but
apparently
without
the
intellectual
perception
of
any
relation
between
the
things
.
   
<EOS>
"
After
a
while
,
instead
of
labels
,
the
individual
letters
were
given
to
her
on
detached
bits
of
paper
:
 
they
were
arranged
side
by
side
so
as
to
spell
BOOK
,
KEY
,
&
c.
;
then
they
were
mixed
up
in
a
heap
and
a
sign
was
made
for
her
to
arrange
them
herself
so
as
to
express
the
words
BOOK
,
KEY
,
&
c.
;
and
she
did
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hitherto
,
the
process
had
been
mechanical
,
and
the
success
about
as
great
as
teaching
a
very
knowing
dog
a
variety
of
tricks
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
child
had
sat
in
mute
amazement
,
and
patiently
imitated
everything
her
teacher
did
;
but
now
the
truth
began
to
flash
upon
her
:
 
<EOS>
her
intellect
began
to
work
:
 
<EOS>
she
perceived
that
here
was
a
way
by
which
she
could
herself
make
up
a
sign
of
anything
that
was
in
her
own
mind
,
and
show
it
to
another
mind
;
and
at
once
her
countenance
lighted
up
with
a
human
expression
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
no
longer
a
dog
,
or
parrot
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
an
immortal
spirit
,
eagerly
seizing
upon
a
new
link
of
union
with
other
spirits
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
almost
fix
upon
the
moment
when
this
truth
dawned
upon
her
mind
,
and
spread
its
light
to
her
countenance
;
I
saw
that
the
great
obstacle
was
overcome
;
and
that
henceforward
nothing
but
patient
and
persevering
,
but
plain
and
straightforward
,
efforts
were
to
be
used
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
result
thus
far
,
is
quickly
related
,
and
easily
conceived
;
but
not
so
was
the
process
;
for
many
weeks
of
apparently
unprofitable
labour
were
passed
before
it
was
effected
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
it
was
said
above
that
a
sign
was
made
,
it
was
intended
to
say
,
that
the
action
was
performed
by
her
teacher
,
she
feeling
his
hands
,
and
then
imitating
the
motion
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
next
step
was
to
procure
a
set
of
metal
types
,
with
the
different
letters
of
the
alphabet
cast
upon
their
ends
;
also
a
board
,
in
which
were
square
holes
,
into
which
holes
<EOS>
she
could
set
the
types
;
so
that
the
letters
on
their
ends
could
alone
be
felt
above
the
surface
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
on
any
article
being
handed
to
her
,
for
instance
,
a
pencil
,
or
a
watch
,
she
would
select
the
component
letters
,
and
arrange
them
on
her
board
,
and
read
them
with
apparent
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
was
exercised
for
several
weeks
in
this
way
,
until
her
vocabulary
became
extensive
;
and
then
the
important
step
was
taken
of
teaching
her
how
to
represent
the
different
letters
by
the
position
of
her
fingers
,
instead
of
the
cumbrous
apparatus
of
the
board
and
types
.
 
<EOS>
She
accomplished
this
speedily
and
easily
,
for
her
intellect
had
begun
to
work
in
aid
of
her
teacher
,
and
her
progress
was
rapid
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
was
the
period
,
about
three
months
after
she
had
commenced
,
that
the
first
report
of
her
case
was
made
,
in
which
it
was
stated
that
"
she
has
just
learned
the
manual
alphabet
,
as
used
by
the
deaf
mutes
,
and
it
is
a
subject
of
delight
and
wonder
to
see
how
rapidly
,
correctly
,
and
eagerly
,
she
goes
on
with
her
labours
.
 
<EOS>
Her
teacher
gives
her
a
new
object
,
for
instance
,
a
pencil
,
first
lets
her
examine
it
,
and
get
an
idea
of
its
use
,
then
teaches
her
how
to
spell
it
by
making
the
signs
for
the
letters
with
her
own
fingers
:
the
child
grasps
her
hand
,
and
feels
her
fingers
,
as
the
different
letters
are
formed
;
she
turns
her
head
a
little
on
one
side
like
a
person
listening
closely
;
her
lips
are
apart
;
she
seems
scarcely
to
breathe
;
and
her
countenance
,
at
first
anxious
,
gradually
changes
to
a
smile
,
as
she
comprehends
the
lesson
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
holds
up
her
tiny
fingers
,
and
spells
the
word
in
the
manual
alphabet
;
next
,
she
takes
her
types
and
arranges
her
letters
;
and
last
,
to
make
sure
that
she
is
right
<EOS>
,
she
takes
the
whole
of
the
types
composing
the
word
,
and
places
them
upon
or
in
contact
with
the
pencil
,
or
whatever
the
object
may
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
whole
of
the
succeeding
year
was
passed
in
gratifying
her
eager
inquiries
for
the
names
of
every
object
which
she
could
possibly
handle
;
in
exercising
her
in
the
use
of
the
manual
alphabet
;
in
extending
in
every
possible
way
her
knowledge
of
the
physical
relations
of
things
;
and
in
proper
care
of
her
health
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
the
end
of
the
year
a
report
of
her
case
was
made
,
from
which
the
following
is
an
extract
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
It
has
been
ascertained
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt
,
that
she
can
not
see
a
ray
of
light
,
can
not
hear
the
least
sound
,
and
never
exercises
her
sense
of
smell
,
if
she
have
any
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
her
mind
dwells
in
darkness
and
stillness
,
as
profound
as
that
of
a
closed
tomb
at
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
Of
beautiful
sights
,
and
sweet
sounds
,
and
pleasant
odours
,
she
has
no
conception
;
nevertheless
,
she
seems
as
happy
and
playful
as
a
bird
or
a
lamb
;
and
the
employment
of
her
intellectual
faculties
,
or
the
acquirement
of
a
new
idea
,
gives
her
a
vivid
pleasure
,
which
is
plainly
marked
in
her
expressive
features
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
seems
to
repine
,
but
has
all
the
buoyancy
and
gaiety
of
childhood
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
fond
of
fun
and
frolic
,
and
when
playing
with
the
rest
of
the
children
,
her
shrill
laugh
sounds
loudest
of
the
group
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
When
left
alone
,
she
seems
very
happy
if
she
have
her
knitting
or
sewing
,
and
will
busy
herself
for
hours
;
if
she
have
no
occupation
,
she
evidently
amuses
herself
by
imaginary
dialogues
,
or
by
recalling
past
impressions
;
she
counts
with
her
fingers
,
or
spells
out
names
of
things
which
she
has
recently
learned
,
in
the
manual
alphabet
of
the
deaf
mutes
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
lonely
self
-
communion
she
seems
to
reason
,
reflect
,
and
argue
;
if
she
spell
a
word
wrong
with
the
fingers
of
her
right
hand
,
she
instantly
strikes
it
with
her
left
,
as
her
teacher
does
,
in
sign
of
disapprobation
;
if
right
,
then
she
pats
herself
upon
the
head
,
and
looks
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
She
sometimes
purposely
spells
a
word
wrong
with
the
left
hand
,
looks
roguish
for
a
moment
and
laughs
,
and
then
with
the
right
hand
strikes
the
left
,
as
if
to
correct
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
During
the
year
she
has
attained
great
dexterity
in
the
use
of
the
manual
alphabet
of
the
deaf
mutes
;
and
she
spells
out
the
words
and
sentences
which
she
knows
,
so
fast
and
so
deftly
,
that
only
those
accustomed
to
this
language
can
follow
with
the
eye
the
rapid
motions
of
her
fingers
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
But
wonderful
as
is
the
rapidity
with
which
she
writes
her
thoughts
upon
the
air
,
still
more
so
is
the
ease
and
accuracy
with
which
she
reads
the
words
thus
written
by
another
;
grasping
their
hands
in
hers
,
and
following
every
movement
of
their
fingers
,
as
letter
after
letter
conveys
their
meaning
to
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
in
this
way
that
she
converses
with
her
blind
playmates
,
and
nothing
can
more
forcibly
show
the
power
of
mind
in
forcing
matter
to
its
purpose
than
a
meeting
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
For
if
great
talent
and
skill
are
necessary
for
two
pantomimes
to
paint
their
thoughts
and
feelings
by
the
movements
of
the
body
,
and
the
expression
of
the
countenance
,
how
much
greater
the
difficulty
when
darkness
shrouds
them
both
,
and
the
one
can
hear
no
sound
.

When
Laura
is
walking
through
a
passage
-
way
,
with
her
hands
spread
before
her
,
she
knows
instantly
every
one
she
meets
,
and
passes
them
with
a
sign
of
recognition
:
 
<EOS>
but
if
it
be
a
girl
of
her
own
age
,
and
especially
if
it
be
one
of
her
favourites
,
there
is
instantly
a
bright
smile
of
recognition
,
a
twining
of
arms
,
a
grasping
of
hands
,
and
a
swift
telegraphing
upon
the
tiny
fingers
;
<EOS>
whose
rapid
evolutions
convey
the
thoughts
and
feelings
from
the
outposts
of
one
mind
to
those
of
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
questions
and
answers
,
exchanges
of
joy
or
sorrow
,
there
are
kissings
and
partings
,
just
as
between
little
children
with
all
their
senses
.

During
this
year
,
and
six
months
after
she
had
left
home
,
her
mother
came
to
visit
her
,
and
the
scene
of
their
meeting
was
an
interesting
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
mother
stood
some
time
,
gazing
with
overflowing
eyes
upon
her
unfortunate
child
,
who
,
all
unconscious
of
her
presence
,
was
playing
about
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
Laura
ran
against
her
,
and
at
once
began
feeling
her
hands
,
examining
her
dress
,
and
trying
to
find
out
if
she
knew
her
;
but
not
succeeding
in
this
,
she
turned
away
as
from
a
stranger
,
and
the
poor
woman
could
not
conceal
the
pang
she
felt
,
at
finding
that
her
beloved
child
did
not
know
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
gave
Laura
a
string
of
beads
which
she
used
to
wear
at
home
,
which
were
recognised
by
the
child
at
once
,
who
,
with
much
joy
,
put
them
around
her
neck
,
and
sought
me
eagerly
to
say
she
understood
the
string
was
from
her
home
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
mother
now
sought
to
caress
her
,
but
poor
Laura
repelled
her
,
preferring
to
be
with
her
acquaintances
.
   
<EOS>
"
Another
article
from
home
was
now
given
her
,
and
she
began
to
look
much
interested
;
she
examined
the
stranger
much
closer
,
and
gave
me
to
understand
that
she
knew
she
came
from
Hanover
;
she
even
endured
her
caresses
,
but
would
leave
her
with
indifference
at
the
slightest
signal
.
 
<EOS>
The
distress
of
the
mother
was
now
painful
to
behold
;
for
,
although
she
had
feared
that
she
should
not
be
recognised
,
the
painful
reality
of
being
treated
with
cold
indifference
by
a
darling
child
,
was
too
much
for
woman
's
nature
to
bear
.
   
<EOS>
"
After
a
while
,
on
the
mother
taking
hold
of
her
again
,
a
vague
idea
seemed
to
flit
across
Laura
's
mind
,
that
this
could
not
be
a
stranger
;
she
therefore
felt
her
hands
very
eagerly
,
while
her
countenance
assumed
an
expression
of
intense
interest
;
she
became
very
pale
;
and
then
suddenly
red
;
hope
seemed
struggling
with
doubt
and
anxiety
,
and
never
were
contending
emotions
more
strongly
painted
upon
the
human
face
:
 
at
this
moment
of
painful
uncertainty
,
the
mother
drew
her
close
to
her
side
,
and
kissed
her
fondly
,
when
at
once
the
truth
flashed
upon
the
child
,
and
all
mistrust
and
anxiety
disappeared
from
her
face
,
as
with
an
expression
of
exceeding
joy
she
eagerly
nestled
to
the
bosom
of
her
parent
,
and
yielded
herself
to
her
fond
embraces
.
   
<EOS>
"
After
this
,
the
beads
were
all
unheeded
;
the
playthings
which
were
offered
to
her
were
utterly
disregarded
;
her
playmates
,
for
whom
but
a
moment
before
she
gladly
left
the
stranger
,
now
vainly
strove
to
pull
her
from
her
mother
;
and
though
she
yielded
her
usual
instantaneous
obedience
to
my
signal
to
follow
me
,
it
was
evidently
with
painful
reluctance
.
 
<EOS>
She
clung
close
to
me
,
as
if
bewildered
and
fearful
;
and
when
,
after
a
moment
,
I
took
her
to
her
mother
,
she
sprang
to
her
arms
,
and
clung
to
her
with
eager
joy
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
subsequent
parting
between
them
,
showed
alike
the
affection
,
the
intelligence
,
and
the
resolution
of
the
child
.
   
<EOS>
"
Laura
accompanied
her
mother
to
the
door
,
clinging
close
to
her
all
the
way
,
until
they
arrived
at
the
threshold
,
where
she
paused
,
and
felt
around
,
to
ascertain
who
was
near
her
.
 
<EOS>
Perceiving
the
matron
,
of
whom
she
is
very
fond
,
she
grasped
her
with
one
hand
,
holding
on
convulsively
to
her
mother
with
the
other
;
and
thus
she
stood
for
a
moment
:
 
<EOS>
then
she
dropped
her
mother
's
hand
;
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
;
and
turning
round
,
clung
sobbing
to
the
matron
;
while
her
mother
departed
,
with
emotions
as
deep
as
those
of
her
child
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
remarked
in
former
reports
,
that
she
can
distinguish
different
degrees
of
intellect
in
others
,
and
that
she
soon
regarded
,
almost
with
contempt
,
a
new
-
comer
,
when
,
after
a
few
days
,
she
discovered
her
weakness
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
This
unamiable
part
of
her
character
has
been
more
strongly
developed
during
the
past
year
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
chooses
for
her
friends
and
companions
,
those
children
who
are
intelligent
,
and
can
talk
best
with
her
;
and
she
evidently
dislikes
to
be
with
those
who
are
deficient
in
intellect
,
unless
,
indeed
,
she
can
make
them
serve
her
purposes
,
which
she
is
evidently
inclined
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
She
takes
advantage
of
them
,
and
makes
them
wait
upon
her
,
in
a
manner
that
she
knows
she
could
not
exact
of
others
;
and
in
various
ways
shows
her
Saxon
blood
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
is
fond
of
having
other
children
noticed
and
caressed
by
the
teachers
,
and
those
whom
she
respects
;
but
this
must
not
be
carried
too
far
,
or
she
becomes
jealous
.
 
<EOS>
She
wants
to
have
her
share
,
which
,
if
not
the
lion
's
,
is
the
greater
part
;
and
if
she
does
not
get
it
,
she
says
,
"
MY
MOTHER
WILL
LOVE
ME
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Her
tendency
to
imitation
is
so
strong
,
that
it
leads
her
to
actions
which
must
be
entirely
incomprehensible
to
her
,
and
which
can
give
her
no
other
pleasure
than
the
gratification
of
an
internal
faculty
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
been
known
to
sit
for
half
an
hour
,
holding
a
book
before
her
sightless
eyes
,
and
moving
her
lips
,
as
she
has
observed
seeing
people
do
when
reading
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
one
day
pretended
that
her
doll
was
sick
;
and
went
through
all
the
motions
of
tending
it
,
and
giving
it
medicine
;
she
then
put
it
carefully
to
bed
,
and
placed
a
bottle
of
hot
water
to
its
feet
,
laughing
all
the
time
most
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
came
home
,
she
insisted
upon
my
going
to
see
it
,
and
feel
its
pulse
;
and
when
I
told
her
to
put
a
blister
on
its
back
,
she
seemed
to
enjoy
it
amazingly
,
and
almost
screamed
with
delight
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
social
feelings
,
and
her
affections
,
are
very
strong
;
and
when
she
is
sitting
at
work
,
or
at
her
studies
,
by
the
side
of
one
of
her
little
friends
,
she
will
break
off
from
her
task
every
few
moments
,
to
hug
and
kiss
them
with
an
earnestness
and
warmth
that
is
touching
to
behold
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
left
alone
,
she
occupies
and
apparently
amuses
herself
,
and
seems
quite
contented
;
and
so
strong
seems
to
be
the
natural
tendency
of
thought
to
put
on
the
garb
of
language
,
that
she
often
soliloquizes
in
the
FINGER
LANGUAGE
,
slow
and
tedious
as
it
is
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
only
when
alone
,
that
she
is
quiet
:
 
for
if
she
becomes
sensible
of
the
presence
of
any
one
near
her
,
she
is
restless
until
she
can
sit
close
beside
them
,
hold
their
hand
,
and
converse
with
them
by
signs
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
her
intellectual
character
it
is
pleasing
to
observe
an
insatiable
thirst
for
knowledge
,
and
a
quick
perception
of
the
relations
of
things
.
 
<EOS>
In
her
moral
character
,
it
is
beautiful
to
behold
her
continual
gladness
,
her
keen
enjoyment
of
existence
,
her
expansive
love
,
her
unhesitating
confidence
,
her
sympathy
with
suffering
,
her
conscientiousness
,
truthfulness
,
and
hopefulness
.
"
   
<EOS>
Such
are
a
few
fragments
from
the
simple
but
most
interesting
and
instructive
history
of
Laura
Bridgman
.
 
<EOS>
The
name
of
her
great
benefactor
and
friend
,
who
writes
it
,
is
Dr.
Howe
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
not
many
persons
,
I
hope
and
believe
,
who
,
after
reading
these
passages
,
can
ever
hear
that
name
with
indifference
.
   
<EOS>
A
further
account
has
been
published
by
Dr.
Howe
,
since
the
report
from
which
I
have
just
quoted
.
 
<EOS>
It
describes
her
rapid
mental
growth
and
improvement
during
twelve
months
more
,
and
brings
her
little
history
down
to
the
end
of
last
year
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
remarkable
,
that
as
we
dream
in
words
,
and
carry
on
imaginary
conversations
,
in
which
we
speak
both
for
ourselves
and
for
the
shadows
who
appear
to
us
in
those
visions
of
the
night
,
so
she
,
having
no
words
,
uses
her
finger
alphabet
in
her
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
has
been
ascertained
that
when
her
slumber
is
broken
,
and
is
much
disturbed
by
dreams
,
she
expresses
her
thoughts
in
an
irregular
and
confused
manner
on
her
fingers
:
 
just
as
we
should
murmur
and
mutter
them
indistinctly
,
in
the
like
circumstances
.
   
<EOS>
I
turned
over
the
leaves
of
her
Diary
,
and
found
it
written
in
a
fair
legible
square
hand
,
and
expressed
in
terms
which
were
quite
intelligible
without
any
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
On
my
saying
that
I
should
like
to
see
her
write
again
,
the
teacher
who
sat
beside
her
,
bade
her
,
in
their
language
,
sign
her
name
upon
a
slip
of
paper
,
twice
or
thrice
.
 
<EOS>
In
doing
so
,
I
observed
that
she
kept
her
left
hand
always
touching
,
and
following
up
,
her
right
,
in
which
,
of
course
,
she
held
the
pen
.
 
<EOS>
No
line
was
indicated
by
any
contrivance
,
but
she
wrote
straight
and
freely
.
   
<EOS>
She
had
,
until
now
,
been
quite
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
visitors
;
but
,
having
her
hand
placed
in
that
of
the
gentleman
who
accompanied
me
,
she
immediately
expressed
his
name
upon
her
teacher
's
palm
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
her
sense
of
touch
is
now
so
exquisite
,
that
having
been
acquainted
with
a
person
once
,
she
can
recognise
him
or
her
after
almost
any
interval
.
 
<EOS>
This
gentleman
had
been
in
her
company
,
I
believe
,
but
very
seldom
,
and
certainly
had
not
seen
her
for
many
months
.
 
<EOS>
My
hand
she
rejected
at
once
,
as
she
does
that
of
any
man
who
is
a
stranger
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
retained
my
wife
's
with
evident
pleasure
,
kissed
her
,
and
examed
her
dress
with
a
girl
's
curiosity
and
interest
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
merry
and
cheerful
,
and
showed
much
innocent
playfulness
in
her
intercourse
with
her
teacher
.
 
<EOS>
Her
delight
on
recognising
a
favourite
playfellow
and
companion
---
herself
a
blind
girl
---
who
silently
,
and
with
an
equal
enjoyment
of
the
coming
surprise
,
took
a
seat
beside
her
,
was
beautiful
to
witness
.
 
<EOS>
It
elicited
from
her
at
first
,
as
other
slight
circumstances
did
twice
or
thrice
during
my
visit
,
an
uncouth
noise
which
was
rather
painful
to
hear
.
 
<EOS>
But
of
her
teacher
touching
her
lips
,
she
immediately
desisted
,
and
embraced
her
laughingly
and
affectionately
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
previously
been
into
another
chamber
,
where
a
number
of
blind
boys
were
swinging
,
and
climbing
,
and
engaged
in
various
sports
.
<EOS>
They
all
clamoured
,
as
we
entered
,
to
the
assistant
-
master
,
who
accompanied
us
,
"
Look
at
me
,
Mr
Hart
!
 
<EOS>
Please
,
Mr
Hart
,
look
at
me
!
<EOS>
"
evincing
,
I
thought
,
even
in
this
,
an
anxiety
peculiar
to
their
condition
,
that
their
little
feats
of
agility
should
be
SEEN
.
<EOS>
Among
them
was
a
small
laughing
fellow
,
who
stood
aloof
,
entertaining
himself
with
a
gymnastic
exercise
for
bringing
the
arms
and
chest
into
play
;
which
he
enjoyed
mightily
;
especially
when
,
in
thrusting
out
his
right
arm
,
he
brought
it
into
contact
with
another
boy
.
 
<EOS>
Like
Laura
Bridgman
,
this
young
child
was
deaf
,
and
dumb
,
and
blind
.
   
<EOS>
Dr.
Howe
's
account
of
this
pupil
's
first
instruction
is
so
very
striking
,
and
so
intimately
connected
with
Laura
herself
,
that
I
can
not
refrain
from
a
short
extract
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
premise
that
the
poor
boy
's
name
is
Oliver
Caswell
;
that
he
is
thirteen
years
of
age
;
and
that
he
was
in
full
possession
of
all
his
faculties
,
until
three
years
and
four
months
old
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
then
attacked
by
scarlet
fever
;
in
four
weeks
became
deaf
;
in
a
few
weeks
more
,
blind
;
in
six
months
,
dumb
.
 
<EOS>
He
showed
his
anxious
sense
of
this
last
deprivation
,
by
often
feeling
the
lips
of
other
persons
when
they
were
talking
,
and
then
putting
his
hand
upon
his
own
,
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
he
had
them
in
the
right
position
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
thirst
for
knowledge
,
"
says
Dr.
Howe
,
"
proclaimed
itself
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
house
,
by
his
eager
examination
of
everything
he
could
feel
or
smell
in
his
new
location
.
 
<EOS>
For
instance
,
treading
upon
the
register
of
a
furnace
,
he
instantly
stooped
down
,
and
began
to
feel
it
,
and
soon
discovered
the
way
in
which
the
upper
plate
moved
upon
the
lower
one
;
but
this
was
not
enough
for
him
,
so
lying
down
upon
his
face
,
he
applied
his
tongue
first
to
one
,
then
to
the
other
,
and
seemed
to
discover
that
they
were
of
different
kinds
of
metal
.
   
<EOS>
"
His
signs
were
expressive
:
 
and
the
strictly
natural
language
,
laughing
,
crying
,
sighing
,
kissing
,
embracing
,
&
c.
,
was
perfect
.
   
<EOS>
"
Some
of
the
analogical
signs
which
(
guided
by
his
faculty
of
imitation
)
he
had
contrived
,
were
comprehensible
;
such
as
the
waving
motion
of
his
hand
for
the
motion
of
a
boat
,
the
circular
one
for
a
wheel
,
&
c.
   
<EOS>
"
The
first
object
was
to
break
up
the
use
of
these
signs
and
to
substitute
for
them
the
use
of
purely
arbitrary
ones
.
   
<EOS>
"
Profiting
by
the
experience
I
had
gained
in
the
other
cases
,
I
omitted
several
steps
of
the
process
before
employed
,
and
commenced
at
once
with
the
finger
language
.
 
<EOS>
Taking
,
therefore
,
several
articles
having
short
names
,
such
as
key
,
cup
,
mug
,
&
c.
,
and
with
Laura
for
an
auxiliary
,
I
sat
down
,
and
taking
his
hand
,
placed
it
upon
one
of
them
,
and
then
with
my
own
,
made
the
letters
KEY
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
my
hands
eagerly
with
both
of
his
,
and
on
my
repeating
the
process
,
he
evidently
tried
to
imitate
the
motions
of
my
fingers
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
he
contrived
to
feel
the
motions
of
my
fingers
with
one
hand
,
and
holding
out
the
other
he
tried
to
imitate
them
,
laughing
most
heartily
when
he
succeeded
.
 
<EOS>
Laura
was
by
,
interested
even
to
agitation
;
and
the
two
presented
a
singular
sight
:
 
her
face
was
flushed
and
anxious
,
and
her
fingers
twining
in
among
ours
so
closely
as
to
follow
every
motion
,
but
so
slightly
as
not
to
embarrass
them
;
while
Oliver
stood
attentive
,
his
head
a
little
aside
,
his
face
turned
up
,
his
left
hand
grasping
mine
,
and
his
right
held
out
:
 
at
every
motion
of
my
fingers
his
countenance
betokened
keen
attention
;
there
was
an
expression
of
anxiety
as
he
tried
to
imitate
the
motions
;
then
a
smile
came
stealing
out
as
he
thought
he
could
do
so
,
and
spread
into
a
joyous
laugh
the
moment
he
succeeded
,
and
felt
me
pat
his
head
,
and
Laura
clap
him
heartily
upon
the
back
,
and
jump
up
and
down
in
her
joy
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
learned
more
than
a
half
-
dozen
letters
in
half
an
hour
,
and
seemed
delighted
with
his
success
,
at
least
in
gaining
approbation
.
<EOS>
His
attention
then
began
to
flag
,
and
I
commenced
playing
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
that
in
all
this
he
had
merely
been
imitating
the
motions
of
my
fingers
,
and
placing
his
hand
upon
the
key
,
cup
,
&
c.
,
as
part
of
the
process
,
without
any
perception
of
the
relation
between
the
sign
and
the
object
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
he
was
tired
with
play
<EOS>
I
took
him
back
to
the
table
,
and
he
was
quite
ready
to
begin
again
his
process
of
imitation
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
learned
to
make
the
letters
for
KEY
,
PEN
,
PIN
;
and
by
having
the
object
repeatedly
placed
in
his
hand
,
he
at
last
perceived
the
relation
I
wished
to
establish
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
evident
,
because
,
when
I
made
the
letters
PIN
,
or
PEN
,
or
CUP
,
he
would
select
the
article
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
perception
of
this
relation
was
not
accompanied
by
that
radiant
flash
of
intelligence
,
and
that
glow
of
joy
,
which
marked
the
delightful
moment
when
Laura
first
perceived
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
placed
all
the
articles
on
the
table
,
and
going
away
a
little
distance
with
the
children
,
placed
Oliver
's
fingers
in
the
positions
to
spell
KEY
,
on
which
Laura
went
and
brought
the
article
:
 
<EOS>
the
little
fellow
seemed
much
amused
by
this
,
and
looked
very
attentive
and
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
caused
him
to
make
the
letters
BREAD
,
and
in
an
instant
Laura
went
and
brought
him
a
piece
:
 
<EOS>
he
smelled
at
it
;
put
it
to
his
lips
;
cocked
up
his
head
with
a
most
knowing
look
;
seemed
to
reflect
a
moment
;
and
then
laughed
outright
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
Aha
!
 
<EOS>
I
understand
now
how
something
may
be
made
out
of
this
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
now
clear
that
he
had
the
capacity
and
inclination
to
learn
,
that
he
was
a
proper
subject
for
instruction
,
and
needed
only
persevering
attention
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
put
him
in
the
hands
of
an
intelligent
teacher
,
nothing
doubting
of
his
rapid
progress
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Well
may
this
gentleman
call
that
a
delightful
moment
,
in
which
some
distant
promise
of
her
present
state
first
gleamed
upon
the
darkened
mind
of
Laura
Bridgman
.
 
<EOS>
Throughout
his
life
,
the
recollection
of
that
moment
will
be
to
him
a
source
of
pure
,
unfading
happiness
;
nor
will
it
shine
less
brightly
on
the
evening
of
his
days
of
Noble
Usefulness
.
   
<EOS>
The
affection
which
exists
between
these
two
---
the
master
and
the
pupil
---
is
as
far
removed
from
all
ordinary
care
and
regard
,
as
the
circumstances
in
which
it
has
had
its
growth
,
are
apart
from
the
common
occurrences
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
occupied
now
,
in
devising
means
of
imparting
to
her
,
higher
knowledge
;
and
of
conveying
to
her
some
adequate
idea
of
the
Great
Creator
of
that
universe
in
which
,
dark
and
silent
and
scentless
though
it
be
to
her
,
she
has
such
deep
delight
and
glad
enjoyment
.
   
<EOS>
Ye
who
have
eyes
and
see
not
,
and
have
ears
and
hear
not
;
ye
who
are
as
the
hypocrites
of
sad
countenances
,
and
disfigure
your
faces
that
ye
may
seem
unto
men
to
fast
;
learn
healthy
cheerfulness
,
and
mild
contentment
,
from
the
deaf
,
and
dumb
,
and
blind
!
 
<EOS>
Self
-
elected
saints
with
gloomy
brows
,
this
sightless
,
earless
<EOS>
,
voiceless
child
may
teach
you
lessons
you
will
do
well
to
follow
.
 
<EOS>
Let
that
poor
hand
of
hers
lie
gently
on
your
hearts
;
for
there
may
be
something
in
its
healing
touch
akin
to
that
of
the
Great
Master
whose
precepts
you
misconstrue
,
whose
lessons
you
pervert
,
of
whose
charity
and
sympathy
with
all
the
world
,
not
one
among
you
in
his
daily
practice
knows
as
much
as
many
of
the
worst
among
those
fallen
sinners
,
to
whom
you
are
liberal
in
nothing
but
the
preachment
of
perdition
!
   
<EOS>
As
I
rose
to
quit
the
room
,
a
pretty
little
child
of
one
of
the
attendants
came
running
in
to
greet
its
father
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
moment
,
a
child
with
eyes
,
among
the
sightless
crowd
,
impressed
me
almost
as
painfully
as
the
blind
boy
in
the
porch
had
done
,
two
hours
ago
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
how
much
brighter
and
more
deeply
blue
,
glowing
and
rich
though
it
had
been
before
,
was
the
scene
without
,
contrasting
with
the
darkness
of
so
many
youthful
lives
within
!
   
<EOS>
At
SOUTH
BOSTON
,
as
it
is
called
,
in
a
situation
excellently
adapted
for
the
purpose
,
several
charitable
institutions
are
clustered
together
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
these
,
is
the
State
Hospital
for
the
insane
;
admirably
conducted
on
those
enlightened
principles
of
conciliation
and
kindness
,
which
twenty
years
ago
would
have
been
worse
than
heretical
,
and
which
have
been
acted
upon
with
so
much
success
in
our
own
pauper
Asylum
at
Hanwell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Evince
a
desire
to
show
some
confidence
,
and
repose
some
trust
,
even
in
mad
people
,
"
said
the
resident
physician
,
as
we
walked
along
the
galleries
,
his
patients
flocking
round
us
unrestrained
.
 
<EOS>
Of
those
who
deny
or
doubt
the
wisdom
of
this
maxim
after
witnessing
its
effects
,
if
there
be
such
people
still
alive
,
I
can
only
say
that
I
hope
I
may
never
be
summoned
as
a
Juryman
on
a
Commission
of
Lunacy
<EOS>
whereof
they
are
the
subjects
;
for
I
should
certainly
find
them
out
of
their
senses
,
on
such
evidence
alone
.
   
<EOS>
Each
ward
in
this
institution
is
shaped
like
a
long
gallery
or
hall
,
with
the
dormitories
of
the
patients
opening
from
it
on
either
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Here
they
work
,
read
,
play
at
skittles
,
and
other
games
;
and
when
the
weather
does
not
admit
of
their
taking
exercise
out
of
doors
,
pass
the
day
together
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
of
these
rooms
,
seated
,
calmly
,
and
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
,
among
a
throng
of
mad
-
women
,
black
and
white
,
were
the
physician
's
wife
and
another
lady
,
with
a
couple
of
children
.
 
<EOS>
These
ladies
were
graceful
and
handsome
;
and
it
was
not
difficult
to
perceive
at
a
glance
that
even
their
presence
there
,
had
a
highly
beneficial
influence
on
the
patients
who
were
grouped
about
them
.
   
<EOS>
Leaning
her
head
against
the
chimney
-
piece
,
with
a
great
assumption
of
dignity
and
refinement
of
manner
,
sat
an
elderly
female
,
in
as
many
scraps
of
finery
as
Madge
Wildfire
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Her
head
in
particular
was
so
strewn
with
scraps
of
gauze
and
cotton
and
bits
of
paper
,
and
had
so
many
queer
odds
and
ends
stuck
all
about
it
,
that
it
looked
like
a
bird's
-
nest
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
radiant
with
imaginary
jewels
;
wore
a
rich
pair
of
undoubted
gold
spectacles
;
and
gracefully
dropped
upon
her
lap
,
as
we
approached
,
a
very
old
greasy
newspaper
,
in
which
I
dare
say
she
had
been
reading
an
account
of
her
own
presentation
at
some
Foreign
Court
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
been
thus
particular
in
describing
her
,
because
she
will
serve
to
exemplify
the
physician
's
manner
of
acquiring
and
retaining
the
confidence
of
his
patients
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
he
said
aloud
,
taking
me
by
the
hand
,
and
advancing
to
the
fantastic
figure
with
great
politeness
---
not
raising
her
suspicions
by
the
slightest
look
or
whisper
,
or
any
kind
of
aside
,
to
me
:
"
<EOS>
This
lady
is
the
hostess
of
this
mansion
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
It
belongs
to
her
.
<EOS>
Nobody
else
has
anything
whatever
to
do
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
large
establishment
,
as
you
see
,
and
requires
a
great
number
of
attendants
.
 
<EOS>
She
lives
,
you
observe
,
in
the
very
first
style
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
kind
enough
to
receive
my
visits
,
and
to
permit
my
wife
and
family
to
reside
here
;
for
which
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
,
we
are
much
indebted
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
exceedingly
courteous
,
you
perceive
,
"
on
this
hint
she
bowed
condescendingly
,
"
and
will
permit
me
to
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
you
:
 
a
gentleman
from
England
,
Ma'am
:
 
<EOS>
newly
arrived
from
England
,
after
a
very
tempestuous
passage
:
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dickens
,
---
the
lady
of
the
house
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
exchanged
the
most
dignified
salutations
with
profound
gravity
and
respect
,
and
so
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
madwomen
seemed
to
understand
the
joke
perfectly
(
not
only
in
this
case
,
but
in
all
the
others
,
except
their
own
)
,
and
be
highly
amused
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
nature
of
their
several
kinds
of
insanity
was
made
known
to
me
in
the
same
way
,
and
we
left
each
of
them
in
high
good
humour
.
 
<EOS>
Not
only
is
a
thorough
confidence
established
,
by
those
means
,
between
the
physician
and
patient
,
in
respect
of
the
nature
and
extent
of
their
hallucinations
,
but
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
opportunities
are
afforded
for
seizing
any
moment
of
reason
,
to
startle
them
by
placing
their
own
delusion
before
them
in
its
most
incongruous
and
ridiculous
light
.
   
<EOS>
Every
patient
in
this
asylum
sits
down
to
dinner
every
day
with
a
knife
and
fork
;
and
in
the
midst
of
them
sits
the
gentleman
,
whose
manner
of
dealing
with
his
charges
,
I
have
just
described
.
 
<EOS>
At
every
meal
,
moral
influence
alone
restrains
the
more
violent
among
them
from
cutting
the
throats
of
the
rest
;
but
the
effect
of
that
influence
is
reduced
to
an
absolute
certainty
,
and
is
found
,
even
as
a
means
of
restraint
,
to
say
nothing
of
it
as
a
means
of
cure
,
a
hundred
times
more
efficacious
than
all
the
strait
-
waistcoats
,
fetters
,
and
handcuffs
,
that
ignorance
,
prejudice
,
and
cruelty
have
manufactured
since
the
creation
of
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
labour
department
,
every
patient
is
as
freely
trusted
with
the
tools
of
his
trade
as
if
he
were
a
sane
man
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
garden
,
and
on
the
farm
,
they
work
with
spades
,
rakes
,
and
hoes
.
 
<EOS>
For
amusement
,
they
walk
,
run
,
fish
,
paint
,
read
,
and
ride
out
to
take
the
air
in
carriages
provided
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
among
themselves
a
sewing
society
to
make
clothes
for
the
poor
,
which
holds
meetings
,
passes
resolutions
,
never
comes
to
fisty
-
cuffs
or
bowie
-
knives
as
sane
assemblies
have
been
known
to
do
elsewhere
;
and
conducts
all
its
proceedings
with
the
greatest
decorum
.
 
<EOS>
The
irritability
,
which
would
otherwise
be
expended
on
their
own
flesh
,
clothes
,
and
furniture
,
is
dissipated
in
these
pursuits
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
cheerful
,
tranquil
,
and
healthy
.
   
<EOS>
Once
a
week
they
have
a
ball
,
in
which
the
Doctor
and
his
family
,
with
all
the
nurses
and
attendants
,
take
an
active
part
.
 
<EOS>
Dances
and
marches
are
performed
alternately
,
to
the
enlivening
strains
of
a
piano
;
and
now
and
then
some
gentleman
or
lady
(
whose
proficiency
has
been
previously
ascertained
)
obliges
the
company
with
a
song
:
nor
does
it
ever
degenerate
,
at
a
tender
crisis
,
into
a
screech
or
howl
;
wherein
,
I
must
confess
,
I
should
have
thought
the
danger
lay
.
 
<EOS>
At
an
early
hour
they
all
meet
together
for
these
festive
purposes
;
at
eight
o'clock
refreshments
are
served
;
and
at
nine
they
separate
.
   
<EOS>
Immense
politeness
and
good
breeding
are
observed
throughout
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
take
their
tone
from
the
Doctor
;
and
he
moves
a
very
Chesterfield
among
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
Like
other
assemblies
,
these
entertainments
afford
a
fruitful
topic
of
conversation
among
the
ladies
for
some
days
;
and
the
gentlemen
are
so
anxious
to
shine
on
these
occasions
,
that
they
have
been
sometimes
found
"
practising
their
steps
"
in
private
,
to
cut
a
more
distinguished
figure
in
the
dance
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
obvious
that
one
great
feature
of
this
system
,
is
the
inculcation
and
encouragement
,
even
among
such
unhappy
persons
,
of
a
decent
self
-
respect
.
 
<EOS>
Something
of
the
same
spirit
pervades
all
the
Institutions
at
South
Boston
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
the
House
of
Industry
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
branch
of
it
,
which
is
devoted
to
the
reception
of
old
or
otherwise
helpless
paupers
,
these
words
are
painted
on
the
walls
:
 
<EOS>
"
WORTHY
OF
NOTICE
.
<EOS>
SELF
-
GOVERNMENT
,
QUIETUDE
,
AND
PEACE
,
ARE
BLESSINGS
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
assumed
and
taken
for
granted
that
being
there
<EOS>
they
must
be
evil
-
disposed
and
wicked
people
,
before
whose
vicious
eyes
it
is
necessary
to
flourish
threats
and
harsh
restraints
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
met
at
the
very
threshold
with
this
mild
appeal
.
 
<EOS>
All
within
-
doors
is
very
plain
and
simple
,
as
it
ought
to
be
,
but
arranged
with
a
view
to
peace
and
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
It
costs
no
more
than
any
other
plan
of
arrangement
,
but
it
speaks
an
amount
of
consideration
for
those
who
are
reduced
to
seek
a
shelter
there
,
which
puts
them
at
once
upon
their
gratitude
and
good
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
being
parcelled
out
in
great
,
long
,
rambling
wards
,
where
a
certain
amount
of
weazen
life
may
mope
,
and
pine
,
and
shiver
,
all
day
long
,
the
building
is
divided
into
separate
rooms
,
each
with
its
share
of
light
and
air
.
<EOS>
In
these
,
the
better
kind
of
paupers
live
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
a
motive
for
exertion
and
becoming
pride
,
in
the
desire
to
make
these
little
chambers
comfortable
and
decent
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
one
<EOS>
but
it
was
clean
and
neat
,
and
had
its
plant
or
two
upon
the
window
-
sill
,
or
row
of
crockery
upon
the
shelf
,
or
small
display
of
coloured
prints
upon
the
whitewashed
wall
,
or
,
perhaps
,
its
wooden
clock
behind
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
The
orphans
and
young
children
are
in
an
adjoining
building
separate
from
this
,
but
a
part
of
the
same
Institution
.
 
<EOS>
Some
are
such
little
creatures
,
that
the
stairs
are
of
Lilliputian
measurement
,
fitted
to
their
tiny
strides
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
consideration
for
their
years
and
weakness
is
expressed
in
their
very
seats
,
which
are
perfect
curiosities
,
and
look
like
articles
of
furniture
for
a
pauper
doll's
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
imagine
the
glee
of
our
Poor
Law
Commissioners
at
the
notion
of
these
seats
having
arms
and
backs
;
but
small
spines
being
of
older
date
than
their
occupation
of
the
Board
-
room
at
Somerset
House
<EOS>
,
I
thought
even
this
provision
very
merciful
and
kind
.
   
<EOS>
Here
again
,
I
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
inscriptions
on
the
wall
,
which
were
scraps
of
plain
morality
,
easily
remembered
and
understood
:
 
such
as
"
Love
one
another
"
---
"
God
remembers
the
smallest
creature
in
his
creation
:
"
and
straightforward
advice
of
that
nature
.
 
<EOS>
The
books
and
tasks
of
these
smallest
of
scholars
,
were
adapted
,
in
the
same
judicious
manner
,
to
their
childish
powers
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
had
examined
these
lessons
,
four
morsels
of
girls
(
of
whom
one
was
blind
)
sang
a
little
song
,
about
the
merry
month
of
May
,
which
I
thought
(
being
extremely
dismal
)
would
have
suited
an
English
November
better
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
we
went
to
see
their
sleeping
-
rooms
on
the
floor
above
,
in
which
the
arrangements
were
no
less
excellent
and
gentle
than
those
we
had
seen
below
.
 
<EOS>
And
after
observing
that
the
teachers
were
of
a
class
and
character
well
suited
to
the
spirit
of
the
place
,
I
took
leave
of
the
infants
with
a
lighter
heart
than
ever
I
have
taken
leave
of
pauper
infants
yet
.
   
<EOS>
Connected
with
the
House
of
Industry
,
there
is
also
an
Hospital
,
which
was
in
the
best
order
,
and
had
,
I
am
glad
to
say
,
many
beds
unoccupied
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
one
fault
,
however
,
which
is
common
to
all
American
interiors
:
 
the
presence
of
the
eternal
,
accursed
,
suffocating
,
red
-
hot
demon
of
a
stove
,
whose
breath
would
blight
the
purest
air
under
Heaven
.
   
<EOS>
There
are
two
establishments
for
boys
in
this
same
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
One
is
called
the
Boylston
school
,
and
is
an
asylum
for
neglected
and
indigent
boys
who
have
committed
no
crime
,
but
who
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
would
very
soon
be
purged
of
that
distinction
if
they
were
not
taken
from
the
hungry
streets
and
sent
here
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
is
a
House
of
Reformation
for
Juvenile
Offenders
.
<EOS>
They
are
both
under
the
same
roof
,
but
the
two
classes
of
boys
never
come
in
contact
.
   
<EOS>
The
Boylston
boys
,
as
may
be
readily
supposed
,
have
very
much
the
advantage
of
the
others
in
point
of
personal
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
in
their
school
-
room
when
I
came
upon
them
,
and
answered
correctly
,
without
book
,
such
questions
as
where
was
England
;
how
far
was
it
;
what
was
its
population
;
its
capital
city
;
its
form
of
government
;
and
so
forth
.
 
<EOS>
They
sang
a
song
too
,
about
a
farmer
sowing
his
seed
:
 
with
corresponding
action
at
such
parts
as
"
'
tis
<EOS>
thus
he
sows
,
"
"
he
turns
him
round
,
"
"
he
claps
his
hands
;
"
which
gave
it
greater
interest
for
them
,
and
accustomed
them
to
act
together
,
in
an
orderly
manner
.
 
<EOS>
They
appeared
exceedingly
well
-
taught
,
and
not
better
taught
than
fed
;
for
a
more
chubby
-
looking
full
-
waistcoated
set
of
boys
,
I
never
saw
.
   
<EOS>
The
juvenile
offenders
had
not
such
pleasant
faces
by
a
great
deal
,
and
in
this
establishment
there
were
many
boys
of
colour
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
them
first
at
their
work
(
basket
-
making
,
and
the
manufacture
of
palm
-
leaf
hats
)
,
afterwards
in
their
school
,
where
they
sang
a
chorus
in
praise
of
Liberty
:
 
an
odd
,
and
,
one
would
think
,
rather
aggravating
,
theme
for
prisoners
.
 
<EOS>
These
boys
are
divided
into
four
classes
,
each
denoted
by
a
numeral
,
worn
on
a
badge
upon
the
arm
.
<EOS>
On
the
arrival
of
a
new
-
comer
,
he
is
put
into
the
fourth
or
lowest
class
,
and
left
,
by
good
behaviour
,
to
work
his
way
up
into
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
The
design
and
object
of
this
Institution
is
to
reclaim
the
youthful
criminal
by
firm
but
kind
and
judicious
treatment
;
to
make
his
prison
a
place
of
purification
and
improvement
,
not
of
demoralisation
and
corruption
;
to
impress
upon
him
that
there
is
but
one
path
,
and
that
one
sober
industry
,
which
can
ever
lead
him
to
happiness
;
to
teach
him
how
it
may
be
trodden
,
if
his
footsteps
have
never
yet
been
led
that
way
;
and
to
lure
him
back
to
it
if
they
have
strayed
:
 
in
a
word
,
to
snatch
him
from
destruction
,
and
restore
him
to
society
a
penitent
and
useful
member
.
 
<EOS>
The
importance
of
such
an
establishment
,
in
every
point
of
view
,
and
with
reference
to
every
consideration
of
humanity
and
social
policy
,
requires
no
comment
.
   
<EOS>
One
other
establishment
closes
the
catalogue
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
House
of
Correction
for
the
State
,
in
which
silence
is
strictly
maintained
,
but
where
the
prisoners
have
the
comfort
and
mental
relief
of
seeing
each
other
,
and
of
working
together
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
improved
system
of
Prison
Discipline
which
we
have
imported
into
England
,
and
which
has
been
in
successful
operation
among
us
for
some
years
past
.
   
<EOS>
America
,
as
a
new
and
not
over
-
populated
country
,
has
in
all
her
prisons
,
the
one
great
advantage
,
of
being
enabled
to
find
useful
and
profitable
work
for
the
inmates
;
whereas
,
with
us
,
the
prejudice
against
prison
labour
is
naturally
very
strong
,
and
almost
insurmountable
,
when
honest
men
who
have
not
offended
against
the
laws
are
frequently
doomed
to
seek
employment
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Even
in
the
United
States
,
the
principle
of
bringing
convict
labour
and
free
labour
into
a
competition
which
must
obviously
be
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
latter
,
has
already
found
many
opponents
,
whose
number
is
not
likely
to
diminish
with
access
of
years
.
   
<EOS>
For
this
very
reason
though
,
our
best
prisons
would
seem
at
the
first
glance
to
be
better
conducted
than
those
of
America
.
 
<EOS>
The
treadmill
is
conducted
with
little
or
no
noise
;
five
hundred
men
may
pick
oakum
in
the
same
room
,
without
a
sound
;
and
both
kinds
of
labour
admit
of
such
keen
and
vigilant
superintendence
,
as
will
render
even
a
word
of
personal
communication
amongst
the
prisoners
almost
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
the
noise
of
the
loom
,
the
forge
,
the
carpenter
's
hammer
,
or
the
stonemason
's
saw
,
greatly
favour
those
opportunities
of
intercourse
---
hurried
and
brief
no
doubt
,
but
opportunities
still
---
which
these
several
kinds
of
work
,
by
rendering
it
necessary
for
men
to
be
employed
very
near
to
each
other
,
and
often
side
by
side
,
without
any
barrier
or
partition
between
them
,
in
their
very
nature
present
.
 
<EOS>
A
visitor
,
too
,
requires
to
reason
and
reflect
a
little
,
before
the
sight
of
a
number
of
men
engaged
in
ordinary
labour
,
such
as
he
is
accustomed
to
out
of
doors
,
will
impress
him
half
as
strongly
as
the
contemplation
of
the
same
persons
in
the
same
place
and
garb
would
,
if
they
were
occupied
in
some
task
,
marked
and
degraded
everywhere
as
belonging
only
to
felons
in
jails
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
American
state
prison
or
house
of
correction
,
I
found
it
difficult
at
first
to
persuade
myself
that
I
was
really
in
a
jail
:
 
a
place
of
ignominious
punishment
and
endurance
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
this
hour
I
very
much
question
whether
the
humane
boast
that
it
is
not
like
one
<EOS>
,
has
its
root
in
the
true
wisdom
or
philosophy
of
the
matter
.
   
<EOS>
I
hope
I
may
not
be
misunderstood
on
this
subject
,
for
it
is
one
in
which
I
take
a
strong
and
deep
interest
.
 
<EOS>
I
incline
as
little
to
the
sickly
feeling
which
makes
every
canting
lie
or
maudlin
speech
of
a
notorious
criminal
a
subject
of
newspaper
report
and
general
sympathy
,
as
I
do
to
those
good
old
customs
of
the
good
old
times
which
made
England
,
even
so
recently
as
in
the
reign
of
the
Third
King
George
,
in
respect
of
her
criminal
code
and
her
prison
regulations
,
one
of
the
most
bloody
-
minded
and
barbarous
countries
on
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
thought
it
would
do
any
good
to
the
rising
generation
,
I
would
cheerfully
give
my
consent
to
the
disinterment
of
the
bones
of
any
genteel
highwayman
(
the
more
genteel
,
the
more
cheerfully
)
,
and
to
their
exposure
,
piecemeal
,
on
any
sign
-
post
,
gate
,
or
gibbet
,
that
might
be
deemed
a
good
elevation
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
My
reason
is
as
well
convinced
that
these
gentry
were
as
utterly
worthless
and
debauched
villains
,
as
it
is
that
the
laws
and
jails
hardened
them
in
their
evil
courses
,
or
that
their
wonderful
escapes
were
effected
by
the
prison
-
turnkeys
who
,
in
those
admirable
days
,
had
always
been
felons
themselves
,
and
were
,
to
the
last
,
their
bosom
-
friends
and
pot
-
companions
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
I
know
,
as
all
men
do
or
should
,
that
the
subject
of
Prison
Discipline
is
one
of
the
highest
importance
to
any
community
;
and
that
in
her
sweeping
reform
and
bright
example
to
other
countries
on
this
head
,
America
has
shown
great
wisdom
,
great
benevolence
,
and
exalted
policy
.
 
<EOS>
In
contrasting
her
system
with
that
which
we
have
modelled
upon
it
,
I
merely
seek
to
show
that
with
all
its
drawbacks
,
ours
has
some
advantages
of
its
own
.
   
<EOS>
The
House
of
Correction
which
has
led
to
these
remarks
,
is
not
walled
,
like
other
prisons
,
but
is
palisaded
round
about
with
tall
rough
stakes
,
something
after
the
manner
of
an
enclosure
for
keeping
elephants
in
,
as
we
see
it
represented
in
Eastern
prints
and
pictures
.
 
<EOS>
The
prisoners
wear
a
parti
-
coloured
dress
;
and
those
who
are
sentenced
to
hard
labour
,
work
at
nail
-
making
,
or
stone
-
cutting
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
there
,
the
latter
class
of
labourers
were
employed
upon
the
stone
for
a
new
custom
-
house
in
course
of
erection
at
Boston
.
 
<EOS>
They
appeared
to
shape
it
skilfully
and
with
expedition
,
though
there
were
very
few
among
them
(
if
any
)
who
had
not
acquired
the
art
within
the
prison
gates
.
   
<EOS>
The
women
,
all
in
one
large
room
,
were
employed
in
making
light
clothing
,
for
New
Orleans
and
the
Southern
States
.
 
<EOS>
They
did
their
work
in
silence
like
the
men
;
and
like
them
were
over
-
looked
by
the
person
contracting
for
their
labour
,
or
by
some
agent
of
his
appointment
.
 
<EOS>
In
addition
to
this
,
they
are
every
moment
liable
to
be
visited
by
the
prison
officers
appointed
for
that
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
The
arrangements
for
cooking
,
washing
of
clothes
,
and
so
forth
,
are
much
upon
the
plan
of
those
I
have
seen
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
Their
mode
of
bestowing
the
prisoners
at
night
(
which
is
of
general
adoption
)
differs
from
ours
,
and
is
both
simple
and
effective
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
centre
of
a
lofty
area
,
lighted
by
windows
in
the
four
walls
,
are
five
tiers
of
cells
,
one
above
the
other
;
each
tier
having
before
it
a
light
iron
gallery
,
attainable
by
stairs
of
the
same
construction
and
material
:
 
<EOS>
excepting
the
lower
one
,
which
is
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Behind
these
,
back
to
back
with
them
and
facing
the
opposite
wall
,
are
five
corresponding
rows
of
cells
,
accessible
by
similar
means
:
so
that
supposing
the
prisoners
locked
up
in
their
cells
,
an
officer
stationed
on
the
ground
,
with
his
back
to
the
wall
,
has
half
their
number
under
his
eye
at
once
;
the
remaining
half
being
equally
under
the
observation
of
another
officer
on
the
opposite
side
;
and
all
in
one
great
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
Unless
this
watch
be
corrupted
or
sleeping
on
his
post
,
it
is
impossible
for
a
man
to
escape
;
for
even
in
the
event
of
his
forcing
the
iron
door
of
his
cell
without
noise
(
which
is
exceedingly
improbable
)
,
the
moment
he
appears
outside
,
and
steps
into
that
one
of
the
five
galleries
on
which
it
is
situated
,
he
must
be
plainly
and
fully
visible
to
the
officer
below
.
 
<EOS>
Each
of
these
cells
holds
a
small
truckle
bed
,
in
which
one
prisoner
sleeps
;
never
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
small
,
of
course
;
and
the
door
being
not
solid
,
but
grated
,
and
without
blind
or
curtain
,
the
prisoner
within
is
at
all
times
exposed
to
the
observation
and
inspection
of
any
guard
who
may
pass
along
that
tier
at
any
hour
or
minute
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
Every
day
,
the
prisoners
receive
their
dinner
,
singly
,
through
a
trap
in
the
kitchen
wall
;
and
each
man
carries
his
to
his
sleeping
cell
to
eat
it
,
where
he
is
locked
up
,
alone
,
for
that
purpose
,
one
hour
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
of
this
arrangement
struck
me
as
being
admirable
;
and
I
hope
that
the
next
new
prison
we
erect
in
England
may
be
built
on
this
plan
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
given
to
understand
that
in
this
prison
no
swords
or
fire
-
arms
,
or
even
cudgels
,
are
kept
;
nor
is
it
probable
that
,
so
long
as
its
present
excellent
management
continues
,
any
weapon
,
offensive
or
defensive
,
will
ever
be
required
within
its
bounds
.
   
<EOS>
Such
are
the
Institutions
at
South
Boston
!
 
<EOS>
In
all
of
them
,
the
unfortunate
or
degenerate
citizens
of
the
State
are
carefully
instructed
in
their
duties
both
to
God
and
man
;
are
surrounded
by
all
reasonable
means
of
comfort
and
happiness
that
their
condition
will
admit
of
;
are
appealed
to
,
as
members
of
the
great
human
family
,
however
afflicted
,
indigent
,
or
fallen
;
are
ruled
by
the
strong
Heart
,
and
not
by
the
strong
(
though
immeasurably
weaker
)
Hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
described
them
at
some
length
;
firstly
,
because
their
worth
demanded
it
;
and
secondly
,
because
I
mean
to
take
them
for
a
model
,
and
to
content
myself
with
saying
of
others
we
may
come
to
,
whose
design
and
purpose
are
the
same
,
that
in
this
or
that
respect
they
practically
fail
,
or
differ
.
   
<EOS>
I
wish
by
this
account
of
them
,
imperfect
in
its
execution
,
but
in
its
just
intention
,
honest
,
I
could
hope
to
convey
to
my
readers
one
-
hundredth
part
of
the
gratification
,
the
sights
I
have
described
,
afforded
me
.
   
<EOS>
To
an
Englishman
,
accustomed
to
the
paraphernalia
of
Westminster
Hall
,
an
American
Court
of
Law
is
as
odd
a
sight
as
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
an
English
Court
of
Law
would
be
to
an
American
.
 
<EOS>
Except
in
the
Supreme
Court
at
Washington
(
where
the
judges
wear
a
plain
black
robe
)
,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
wig
or
gown
connected
with
the
administration
of
justice
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
of
the
bar
being
barristers
and
attorneys
too
<EOS>
(
for
there
is
no
division
of
those
functions
as
in
England
)
are
no
more
removed
from
their
clients
than
attorneys
in
our
Court
for
the
Relief
of
Insolvent
Debtors
are
,
from
theirs
.
 
<EOS>
The
jury
are
quite
at
home
,
and
make
themselves
as
comfortable
as
circumstances
will
permit
.
 
<EOS>
The
witness
is
so
little
elevated
above
,
or
put
aloof
from
,
the
crowd
in
the
court
,
that
a
stranger
entering
during
a
pause
in
the
proceedings
would
find
it
difficult
to
pick
him
out
from
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
it
chanced
to
be
a
criminal
trial
,
his
eyes
,
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
,
would
wander
to
the
dock
in
search
of
the
prisoner
,
in
vain
;
for
that
gentleman
would
most
likely
be
lounging
among
the
most
distinguished
ornaments
of
the
legal
profession
,
whispering
suggestions
in
his
counsel
's
ear
,
or
making
a
toothpick
out
of
an
old
quill
with
his
penknife
.
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
notice
these
differences
,
when
I
visited
the
courts
at
Boston
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
much
surprised
at
first
,
too
,
to
observe
that
the
counsel
who
interrogated
the
witness
under
examination
at
the
time
,
did
so
SITTING
.
 
<EOS>
But
seeing
that
he
was
also
occupied
in
writing
down
the
answers
,
and
remembering
that
he
was
alone
and
had
no
"
junior
,
"
I
quickly
consoled
myself
with
the
reflection
that
law
was
not
quite
so
expensive
an
article
here
,
as
at
home
;
and
that
the
absence
of
sundry
formalities
which
we
regard
as
indispensable
,
had
doubtless
a
very
favourable
influence
upon
the
bill
of
costs
.
   
<EOS>
In
every
Court
,
ample
and
commodious
provision
is
made
for
the
accommodation
of
the
citizens
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
case
all
through
America
.
 
<EOS>
In
every
Public
Institution
,
the
right
of
the
people
to
attend
,
and
to
have
an
interest
in
the
proceedings
,
is
most
fully
and
distinctly
recognised
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
no
grim
door
-
keepers
to
dole
out
their
tardy
civility
by
the
sixpenny
-
worth
;
nor
is
there
,
I
sincerely
believe
,
any
insolence
of
office
of
any
kind
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
national
is
exhibited
for
money
;
and
no
public
officer
is
a
showman
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
begun
of
late
years
to
imitate
this
good
example
.
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
continue
to
do
so
;
and
that
in
the
fulness
of
time
,
even
deans
and
chapters
may
be
converted
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
civil
court
an
action
was
trying
,
for
damages
sustained
in
some
accident
upon
a
railway
.
 
<EOS>
The
witnesses
had
been
examined
,
and
counsel
was
addressing
the
jury
.
 
<EOS>
The
learned
gentleman
(
like
a
few
of
his
English
brethren
)
was
desperately
long
-
winded
,
and
had
a
remarkable
capacity
of
saying
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
.
<EOS>
His
great
theme
was
"
Warren
the
ENGINE
driver
,
"
whom
he
pressed
into
the
service
of
every
sentence
he
uttered
.
 
<EOS>
I
listened
to
him
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
and
,
coming
out
of
court
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
,
without
the
faintest
ray
of
enlightenment
as
to
the
merits
of
the
case
<EOS>
,
felt
as
if
I
were
at
home
again
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
prisoner
's
cell
,
waiting
to
be
examined
by
the
magistrate
on
a
charge
of
theft
,
was
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
This
lad
,
instead
of
being
committed
to
a
common
jail
,
would
be
sent
to
the
asylum
at
South
Boston
,
and
there
taught
a
trade
;
and
in
the
course
of
time
he
would
be
bound
apprentice
to
some
respectable
master
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
his
detection
in
this
offence
,
instead
of
being
the
prelude
to
a
life
of
infamy
and
a
miserable
death
,
would
lead
,
there
was
a
reasonable
hope
,
to
his
being
reclaimed
from
vice
,
and
becoming
a
worthy
member
of
society
.
   
<EOS>
I
am
by
no
means
a
wholesale
admirer
of
our
legal
solemnities
,
many
of
which
impress
me
as
being
exceedingly
ludicrous
.
 
<EOS>
Strange
as
it
may
seem
too
<EOS>
,
there
is
undoubtedly
a
degree
of
protection
in
the
wig
and
gown
---
a
dismissal
of
individual
responsibility
in
dressing
for
the
part
---
which
encourages
that
insolent
bearing
and
language
,
and
that
gross
perversion
of
the
office
of
a
pleader
for
The
Truth
,
so
frequent
in
our
courts
of
law
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
I
can
not
help
doubting
whether
America
,
in
her
desire
to
shake
off
the
absurdities
and
abuses
of
the
old
system
,
may
not
have
gone
too
far
into
the
opposite
extreme
;
and
whether
it
is
not
desirable
,
especially
in
the
small
community
of
a
city
like
this
,
where
each
man
knows
the
other
,
to
surround
the
administration
of
justice
with
some
artificial
barriers
against
the
"
Hail
fellow
,
well
met
"
deportment
of
everyday
life
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
aid
it
can
have
in
the
very
high
character
and
ability
of
the
Bench
,
not
only
here
but
elsewhere
<EOS>
,
it
has
,
and
well
deserves
to
have
;
but
it
may
need
something
more
:
not
to
impress
the
thoughtful
and
the
well
-
informed
,
but
the
ignorant
and
heedless
;
a
class
which
includes
some
prisoners
and
many
witnesses
.
 
<EOS>
These
institutions
were
established
,
no
doubt
,
upon
the
principle
that
those
who
had
so
large
a
share
in
making
the
laws
,
would
certainly
respect
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
experience
has
proved
this
hope
to
be
fallacious
;
for
no
men
know
better
than
the
judges
of
America
,
that
on
the
occasion
of
any
great
popular
excitement
the
law
is
powerless
,
and
can
not
,
for
the
time
,
assert
its
own
supremacy
.
   
<EOS>
The
tone
of
society
in
Boston
is
one
of
perfect
politeness
,
courtesy
,
and
good
breeding
.
 
<EOS>
The
ladies
are
unquestionably
very
beautiful
---
in
face
:
 
<EOS>
but
there
I
am
compelled
to
stop
.
 
<EOS>
Their
education
is
much
as
with
us
;
neither
better
nor
worse
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
heard
some
very
marvellous
stories
in
this
respect
;
but
not
believing
them
,
was
not
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
Blue
ladies
there
are
,
in
Boston
;
but
like
philosophers
of
that
colour
and
sex
in
most
other
latitudes
,
they
rather
desire
to
be
thought
superior
than
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
Evangelical
ladies
there
are
,
likewise
,
whose
attachment
to
the
forms
of
religion
,
and
horror
of
theatrical
entertainments
,
are
most
exemplary
.
 
<EOS>
Ladies
who
have
a
passion
for
attending
lectures
are
to
be
found
among
all
classes
and
all
conditions
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
kind
of
provincial
life
which
prevails
in
cities
such
as
this
,
the
Pulpit
has
great
influence
.
 
<EOS>
The
peculiar
province
of
the
Pulpit
in
New
England
(
always
excepting
the
Unitarian
Ministry
)
would
appear
to
be
the
denouncement
of
all
innocent
and
rational
amusements
.
<EOS>
The
church
,
the
chapel
,
and
the
lecture
-
room
,
are
the
only
means
of
excitement
excepted
;
and
to
the
church
,
the
chapel
,
and
the
lecture
-
room
,
the
ladies
resort
in
crowds
.
   
<EOS>
Wherever
religion
is
resorted
to
,
as
a
strong
drink
,
and
as
an
escape
from
the
dull
monotonous
round
of
home
,
those
of
its
ministers
who
pepper
the
highest
will
be
the
surest
to
please
.
<EOS>
They
who
strew
the
Eternal
Path
with
the
greatest
amount
of
brimstone
,
and
who
most
ruthlessly
tread
down
the
flowers
and
leaves
that
grow
by
the
wayside
,
will
be
voted
the
most
righteous
;
and
they
who
enlarge
with
the
greatest
pertinacity
on
the
difficulty
of
getting
into
heaven
,
will
be
considered
by
all
true
believers
certain
of
going
there
:
 
though
it
would
be
hard
to
say
by
what
process
of
reasoning
this
conclusion
is
arrived
at
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
so
at
home
,
and
it
is
so
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
With
regard
to
the
other
means
of
excitement
,
the
Lecture
,
it
has
at
least
the
merit
of
being
always
new
.
 
<EOS>
One
lecture
treads
so
quickly
on
the
heels
of
another
,
that
none
are
remembered
;
and
the
course
of
this
month
may
be
safely
repeated
next
,
with
its
charm
of
novelty
unbroken
,
and
its
interest
unabated
.
   
<EOS>
The
fruits
of
the
earth
have
their
growth
in
corruption
.
 
<EOS>
Out
of
the
rottenness
of
these
things
,
there
has
sprung
up
in
Boston
a
sect
of
philosophers
known
as
Transcendentalists
.
 
<EOS>
On
inquiring
what
this
appellation
might
be
supposed
to
signify
,
I
was
given
to
understand
that
whatever
was
unintelligible
would
be
certainly
transcendental
.
 
<EOS>
Not
deriving
much
comfort
from
this
elucidation
,
I
pursued
the
inquiry
still
further
,
and
found
that
the
Transcendentalists
are
followers
of
my
friend
Mr
Carlyle
,
or
I
should
rather
say
,
of
a
follower
of
his
,
Mr
Ralph
Waldo
Emerson
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
has
written
a
volume
of
Essays
,
in
which
,
among
much
that
is
dreamy
and
fanciful
<EOS>
(
if
he
will
pardon
me
for
saying
so
)
,
there
is
much
more
that
is
true
and
manly
,
honest
and
bold
.
<EOS>
Transcendentalism
has
its
occasional
vagaries
(
what
school
has
not
?
)
,
but
it
has
good
healthful
qualities
in
spite
of
them
;
not
least
among
the
number
a
hearty
disgust
of
Ca
nt
,
and
an
aptitude
to
detect
her
in
all
the
million
varieties
of
her
everlasting
wardrobe
.
 
<EOS>
And
therefore
if
I
were
a
Bostonian
,
I
think
I
would
be
a
Transcendentalist
.
   
<EOS>
The
only
preacher
I
heard
in
Boston
was
Mr
Taylor
,
who
addresses
himself
peculiarly
to
seamen
,
and
who
was
once
a
mariner
himself
.
<EOS>
I
found
his
chapel
down
among
the
shipping
,
in
one
of
the
narrow
,
old
,
water
-
side
streets
,
with
a
gay
blue
flag
waving
freely
from
its
roof
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
gallery
opposite
to
the
pulpit
were
a
little
choir
of
male
and
female
singers
,
a
violoncello
,
and
a
violin
.
 
<EOS>
The
preacher
already
sat
in
the
pulpit
,
which
was
raised
on
pillars
,
and
ornamented
behind
him
with
painted
drapery
of
a
lively
and
somewhat
theatrical
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
a
weather
-
beaten
hard
-
featured
man
,
of
about
six
or
eight
and
fifty
;
with
deep
lines
graven
as
it
were
into
his
face
,
dark
hair
,
and
a
stern
,
keen
eye
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
general
character
of
his
countenance
was
pleasant
and
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
The
service
commenced
with
a
hymn
,
to
which
succeeded
an
extemporary
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
the
fault
of
frequent
repetition
,
incidental
to
all
such
prayers
;
but
it
was
plain
and
comprehensive
in
its
doctrines
,
and
breathed
a
tone
of
general
sympathy
and
charity
,
which
is
not
so
commonly
a
characteristic
of
this
form
of
address
to
the
Deity
as
it
might
be
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
he
opened
his
discourse
,
taking
for
his
text
a
passage
from
the
Song
of
Solomon
,
laid
upon
the
desk
before
the
commencement
of
the
service
by
some
unknown
member
of
the
congregation
:
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
this
coming
up
from
the
wilderness
,
leaning
on
the
arm
of
her
beloved
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
handled
his
text
in
all
kinds
of
ways
,
and
twisted
it
into
all
manner
of
shapes
;
but
always
ingeniously
,
and
with
a
rude
eloquence
,
well
adapted
to
the
comprehension
of
his
hearers
.
<EOS>
Indeed
if
I
be
not
mistaken
,
he
studied
their
sympathies
and
understandings
much
more
than
the
display
of
his
own
powers
.
 
<EOS>
His
imagery
was
all
drawn
from
the
sea
,
and
from
the
incidents
of
a
seaman
's
life
;
and
was
often
remarkably
good
.
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
to
them
of
"
that
glorious
man
,
Lord
Nelson
,
"
and
of
Collingwood
;
and
drew
nothing
in
,
as
the
saying
is
,
by
the
head
and
shoulders
,
but
brought
it
to
bear
upon
his
purpose
,
naturally
,
and
with
a
sharp
mind
to
its
effect
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
when
much
excited
with
his
subject
,
he
had
an
odd
way
---
compounded
of
John
Bunyan
,
and
Balfour
of
Burley
---
of
taking
his
great
quarto
Bible
under
his
arm
and
pacing
up
and
down
the
pulpit
with
it
;
looking
steadily
down
,
meantime
,
into
the
midst
of
the
congregation
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
when
he
applied
his
text
to
the
first
assemblage
of
his
hearers
,
and
pictured
the
wonder
of
the
church
at
their
presumption
in
forming
a
congregation
among
themselves
,
he
stopped
short
with
his
Bible
under
his
arm
in
the
manner
I
have
described
,
and
pursued
his
discourse
after
this
manner
:
   
<EOS>
"
Who
are
these
---
who
are
they
---
who
are
these
fellows
?
<EOS>
where
do
they
come
from
?
 
<EOS>
Where
are

Come
from

<EOS>
What
's
the
answer

"
<EOS>
---
leaning
out
of
the
pulpit
,
and
pointing
downward
with
his
right
hand
:
 
"
From
below
!
"
---
starting
back
again
,
and
looking
at
the
sailors
before
him
:
 
"
From
below
,
my
brethren
.
 
<EOS>
From
under
the
hatches
of
sin
,
battened
down
above
you
by
the
evil
one
.
<EOS>
That
's
where
you
came
from
!
"
<EOS>
---
a
walk
up
and
down
the
pulpit
:
 
"
and
where
are
you
going
"
---
stopping
abruptly
:
 
"
where
are
you
going
?
<EOS>
Aloft
!
"
---
<EOS>
very
softly
,
and
pointing
upward
:
 
"
Aloft
!
"
<EOS>
---
louder
:
"
aloft
!
"
<EOS>
---
louder
still
:
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
where
you
are
going
---
with
a
fair
wind
,
---
all
taut
and
trim
,
steering
direct
for
Heaven
in
its
glory
,
where
there
are
no
storms
or
foul
weather
,
and
where
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
,
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
.
"
<EOS>
---
Another
walk
:
"
<EOS>
That
's
where
you
're
going
to
,
my
friends
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
it
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
port
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
haven

<EOS>
It
's
a
blessed
harbour
---
still
water
there
,
in
all
changes
of
the
winds
and
tides
;
<EOS>
no
driving
ashore
upon
the
rocks
,
or
slipping
your
cables
and
running
out
to
sea
,
there
:
 
Peace
---
Peace

Peace
---
all
peace
!
"
<EOS>
---
Another
walk
,
and
patting
the
Bible
under
his
left
arm
:
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
These
fellows
are
coming
from
the
wilderness

are
they
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
dreary
,
blighted
wilderness
of
Iniquity
,
whose
only
crop
is
Death
.
<EOS>
But
do
they
lean
upon
anything
---
<EOS>
do
they
lean
upon
nothing
,
these
poor
seamen
?
"
---
<EOS>
Three
raps
upon
the
Bible
:
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
---
They
lean
upon
the
arm
of

"
---
<EOS>
three
more
raps
:
 
"
upon
the
arm
of
their
Beloved
"
---
three
more
,
and
a
walk
:
 
"
Pilot

guiding

all

one
,
to
all
hands

---
<EOS>
three
more
:
 
<EOS>
"
Here
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
They
can
do
their
seaman
's
duty
manfully
,
and
be
easy
in
their
minds
in
the
utmost
peril
and
danger
,
with
this
"
---
two
more
:
 
"
They
can
come
,
even
these
poor
fellows
can
come
,
from
the
wilderness
leaning
on
the
arm
of
their
Beloved
,
and
go
up
---
up
---
up
!
"
<EOS>
---
raising
his
hand
higher
,
and
higher
,
at
every
repetition
of
the
word
,
so
that
he
stood
with
it
at
last
stretched
above
his
head
,
regarding
them
in
a
strange
,
rapt
manner
,
and
pressing
the
book
triumphantly
to
his
breast
,
until
he
gradually
subsided
into
some
other
portion
of
his
discourse
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
cited
this
,
rather
as
an
instance
of
the
preacher
's
eccentricities
than
his
merits
,
though
taken
in
connection
with
his
look
and
manner
,
and
the
character
of
his
audience
,
even
this
was
striking
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
possible
,
however
,
that
my
favourable
impression
of
him
may
have
been
greatly
influenced
and
strengthened
,
firstly
,
by
his
impressing
upon
his
hearers
that
the
true
observance
of
religion
was
not
inconsistent
with
a
cheerful
deportment
and
an
exact
discharge
of
the
duties
of
their
station
,
which
,
indeed
,
it
scrupulously
required
of
them
;
and
secondly
,
by
his
cautioning
them
not
to
set
up
any
monopoly
in
Paradise
and
its
mercies
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
heard
these
two
points
so
wisely
touched
(
if
indeed
I
have
ever
heard
them
touched
at
all
)
,
by
any
preacher
of
that
kind
before
.
   
<EOS>
Having
passed
the
time
I
spent
in
Boston
,
in
making
myself
acquainted
with
these
things
,
in
settling
the
course
I
should
take
in
my
future
travels
,
and
in
mixing
constantly
with
its
society
,
I
am
not
aware
that
I
have
any
occasion
to
prolong
this
chapter
.
<EOS>
Such
of
its
social
customs
as
I
have
not
mentioned
,
however
,
may
be
told
in
a
very
few
words
.
   
<EOS>
The
usual
dinner
-
hour
is
two
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
A
dinner
party
takes
place
at
five
;
and
at
an
evening
party
,
they
seldom
sup
later
than
eleven
;
so
that
it
goes
hard
but
one
gets
home
,
even
from
a
rout
,
by
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
could
find
out
any
difference
between
a
party
at
Boston
and
a
party
in
London
,
saving
that
at
the
former
place
all
assemblies
are
held
at
more
rational
hours
;
that
the
conversation
may
possibly
be
a
little
louder
and
more
cheerful
;
and
a
guest
is
usually
expected
to
ascend
to
the
very
top
of
the
house
to
take
his
cloak
off
;
that
he
is
certain
to
see
,
at
every
dinner
,
an
unusual
amount
of
poultry
on
the
table
;
and
at
every
supper
,
at
least
two
mighty
bowls
of
hot
stewed
oysters
,
in
any
one
of
which
a
half
-
grown
Duke
of
Clarence
might
be
smothered
easily
.
   
<EOS>
There
are
two
theatres
in
Boston
,
of
good
size
and
construction
,
but
sadly
in
want
of
patronage
.
 
<EOS>
The
few
ladies
who
resort
to
them
,
sit
,
as
of
right
,
in
the
front
rows
of
the
boxes
.
   
<EOS>
The
bar
is
a
large
room
with
a
stone
floor
,
and
there
people
stand
and
smoke
,
and
lounge
about
,
all
the
evening
:
 
dropping
in
and
out
as
the
humour
takes
them
.
 
<EOS>
There
too
the
stranger
is
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
Gin
-
sling
,
Cock
-
tail
,
Sangaree
,
Mint
Julep
,
Sherry
-
cobbler
,
Timber
Doodle
,
and
other
rare
drinks
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
is
full
of
boarders
,
both
married
and
single
,
many
of
whom
sleep
upon
the
premises
,
and
contract
by
the
week
for
their
board
and
lodging
:
the
charge
for
which
diminishes
as
they
go
nearer
the
sky
to
roost
.
<EOS>
A
public
table
is
laid
in
a
very
handsome
hall
for
breakfast
,
and
for
dinner
,
and
for
supper
.
 
<EOS>
The
party
sitting
down
together
to
these
meals
will
vary
in
number
from
one
to
two
hundred
:
 
sometimes
more
.
 
<EOS>
The
advent
of
each
of
these
epochs
in
the
day
is
proclaimed
by
an
awful
gong
,
which
shakes
the
very
window
-
frames
as
it
reverberates
through
the
house
,
and
horribly
disturbs
nervous
foreigners
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
an
ordinary
for
ladies
,
and
an
ordinary
for
gentlemen
.
   
<EOS>
In
our
private
room
the
cloth
could
not
,
for
any
earthly
consideration
,
have
been
laid
for
dinner
without
a
huge
glass
dish
of
cranberries
in
the
middle
of
the
table
;
and
breakfast
would
have
been
no
breakfast
unless
the
principal
dish
were
a
deformed
beefsteak
with
a
great
flat
bone
in
the
centre
,
swimming
in
hot
butter
,
and
sprinkled
with
the
very
blackest
of
all
possible
pepper
.
 
<EOS>
Our
bedroom
was
spacious
and
airy
,
but
(
like
every
bedroom
on
this
side
of
the
Atlantic
)
very
bare
of
furniture
,
having
no
curtains
to
the
French
bedstead
or
to
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
one
unusual
luxury
,
however
,
in
the
shape
of
a
wardrobe
of
painted
wood
,
something
smaller
than
an
English
watch
-
box
;
or
if
this
comparison
should
be
insufficient
to
convey
a
just
idea
of
its
dimensions
,
they
may
be
estimated
from
the
fact
of
my
having
lived
for
fourteen
days
and
nights
in
the
firm
belief
that
it
was
a
shower
-
bath
.

<EOS>
An
American
Railroad
.
 
<EOS>
Lowell
and
Its
Factory
System
 
<EOS>
BEFORE
leaving
Boston
,
I
devoted
one
day
to
an
excursion
to
Lowell
.
<EOS>
I
assign
a
separate
chapter
to
this
visit
;
not
because
I
am
about
to
describe
it
at
any
great
length
,
but
because
I
remember
it
as
a
thing
by
itself
,
and
am
desirous
that
my
readers
should
do
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
I
made
acquaintance
with
an
American
railroad
,
on
this
occasion
,
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
As
these
works
are
pretty
much
alike
all
through
the
States
,
their
general
characteristics
are
easily
described
.
   
<EOS>
There
are
no
first
and
second
class
carriages
as
with
us
;
but
there
is
a
gentleman
's
car
and
a
ladies
'
car
:
 
the
main
distinction
between
which
is
that
in
the
first
,
everybody
smokes
;
and
in
the
second
,
nobody
does
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
black
man
never
travels
with
a
white
one
,
there
is
also
a
negro
car
;
which
is
a
great
,
blundering
,
clumsy
chest
,
such
as
Gulliver
put
to
sea
in
,
from
the
kingdom
of
Brobdingnag
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
great
deal
of
jolting
,
a
great
deal
of
noise
,
a
great
deal
of
wall
,
not
much
window
,
a
locomotive
engine
,
a
shriek
,
and
a
bell
.
   
<EOS>
The
cars
are
like
shabby
omnibuses
,
but
larger
:
 
holding
thirty
,
forty
,
fifty
,
people
.
 
<EOS>
The
seats
,
instead
of
stretching
from
end
to
end
,
are
placed
crosswise
.
 
<EOS>
Each
seat
holds
two
persons
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
long
row
of
them
on
each
side
of
the
caravan
,
a
narrow
passage
up
the
middle
,
and
a
door
at
both
ends
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
centre
of
the
carriage
there
is
usually
a
stove
,
fed
with
charcoal
or
anthracite
coal
;
which
is
for
the
most
part
red
-
hot
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
insufferably
close
;
and
you
see
the
hot
air
fluttering
between
yourself
and
any
other
object
you
may
happen
to
look
at
,
like
the
ghost
of
smoke
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
ladies
'
car
,
there
are
a
great
many
gentlemen
who
have
ladies
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
also
a
great
many
ladies
who
have
nobody
with
them
:
 
for
any
lady
may
travel
alone
,
from
one
end
of
the
United
States
to
the
other
,
and
be
certain
of
the
most
courteous
and
considerate
treatment
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
The
conductor
or
check
-
taker
,
or
guard
,
or
whatever
he
may
be
,
wears
no
uniform
.
 
<EOS>
He
walks
up
and
down
the
car
,
and
in
and
out
of
it
,
as
his
fancy
dictates
;
leans
against
the
door
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
stares
at
you
,
if
you
chance
to
be
a
stranger
;
or
enters
into
conversation
with
the
passengers
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
many
newspapers
are
pulled
out
,
and
a
few
of
them
are
read
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
talks
to
you
,
or
to
anybody
else
who
hits
his
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
are
an
Englishman
,
he
expects
that
that
railroad
is
pretty
much
like
an
English
railroad
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
say
"
No
,
"
he
says
"
<EOS>
Yes
?
"
(
interrogatively
)
,
and
asks
in
what
respect
they
differ
.
 
<EOS>
You
enumerate
the
heads
of
difference
,
one
by
one
,
and
he
says
"
Yes
?
"
<EOS>
(
still
interrogatively
)
to
each
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
guesses
that
you
do
n't
travel
faster
in
England
;
and
on
your
replying
that
you
do
,
says
"
<EOS>
Yes
?
"
again
(
still
interrogatively
)
,
and
it
is
quite
evident
,
do
n't
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
long
pause
he
remarks
,
partly
to
you
,
and
partly
to
the
knob
on
the
top
of
his
stick
,
that
"
Yankees
are
reckoned
to
be
considerable
of
a
go
-
ahead
people
too
;
"
upon
which
YOU
say
"
Yes
,
"
and
then
HE
says
"
Yes
"
again
(
affirmatively
this
time
)
;
and
upon
your
looking
out
of
window
,
tells
you
that
behind
that
hill
,
and
some
three
miles
from
the
next
station
,
there
is
a
clever
town
in
a
smart
lo
-
ca
-
tion
,
where
he
expects
you
have
concluded
to
stop
.
 
<EOS>
Your
answer
in
the
negative
naturally
leads
to
more
questions
in
reference
to
your
intended
route
<EOS>
(
always
pronounced
rout
)
;
and
wherever
you
are
going
,
you
invariably
learn
that
you
ca
n't
get
there
without
immense
difficulty
and
danger
,
and
that
all
the
great
sights
are
somewhere
else
.
   
<EOS>
If
a
lady
take
a
fancy
to
any
male
passenger
's
seat
,
the
gentleman
who
accompanies
her
gives
him
notice
of
the
fact
,
and
he
immediately
vacates
it
with
great
politeness
.
 
<EOS>
Politics
are
much
discussed
,
so
are
banks
,
so
is
cotton
.
 
<EOS>
Quiet
people
avoid
the
question
of
the
Presidency
,
for
there
will
be
a
new
election
in
three
years
and
a
half
,
and
party
feeling
runs
very
high
:
 
the
great
constitutional
feature
of
this
institution
being
,
that
directly
the
acrimony
of
the
last
election
is
over
,
the
acrimony
of
the
next
one
begins
;
which
is
an
unspeakable
comfort
to
all
strong
politicians
and
true
lovers
of
their
country
:
 
that
is
to
say
,
to
ninety
-
nine
men
and
boys
out
of
every
ninety
-
nine
and
a
quarter
.
   
<EOS>
Except
when
a
branch
road
joins
the
main
one
,
there
is
seldom
more
than
one
track
of
rails
;
so
that
the
road
is
very
narrow
,
and
the
view
,
where
there
is
a
deep
cutting
,
by
no
means
extensive
.
 
<EOS>
When
there
is
not
,
the
character
of
the
scenery
is
always
the
same
.
<EOS>
Mile
after
mile
of
stunted
trees
:
 
some
hewn
down
by
the
axe
,
some
blown
down
by
the
wind
,
some
half
fallen
and
resting
on
their
neighbours
<EOS>
,
many
mere
logs
half
hidden
in
the
swamp
,
others
mouldered
away
to
spongy
chips
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
soil
of
the
earth
is
made
up
of
minute
fragments
such
as
these
;
each
pool
of
stagnant
water
has
its
crust
of
vegetable
rottenness
;
on
every
side
there
are
the
boughs
,
and
trunks
,
and
stumps
of
trees
,
in
every
possible
stage
of
decay
,
decomposition
,
and
neglect
.
 
<EOS>
Now
you
emerge
for
a
few
brief
minutes
on
an
open
country
,
glittering
with
some
bright
lake
or
pool
,
broad
as
many
an
English
river
,
but
so
small
here
that
it
scarcely
has
a
name
;
now
catch
hasty
glimpses
of
a
distant
town
,
with
its
clean
white
houses
and
their
cool
piazzas
,
its
prim
New
England
church
and
school
-
house
;
when
whir
-
r
-
r
-
r
!
<EOS>
almost
before
you
have
seen
them
,
comes
the
same
dark
screen
:
 
<EOS>
the
stunted
trees
,
the
stumps
,
the
logs
,
the
stagnant
water
---
all
so
like
the
last
that
you
seem
to
have
been
transported
back
again
by
magic
.
   
<EOS>
The
train
calls
at
stations
in
the
woods
,
where
the
wild
impossibility
of
anybody
having
the
smallest
reason
to
get
out
,
is
only
to
be
equalled
by
the
apparently
desperate
hopelessness
of
there
being
anybody
to
get
in
.
 
<EOS>
It
rushes
across
the
turnpike
road
,
where
there
is
no
gate
,
no
policeman
,
no
signal
:
 
nothing
but
a
rough
wooden
arch
,
on
which
is
painted
"
WHEN
THE
BELL
RINGS
,
LOOK
OUT
FOR
THE
LOCOMOTIVE
.
"
 
<EOS>
On
it
<EOS>
whirls
headlong
,
dives
through
the
woods
again
<EOS>
,
emerges
in
the
light
,
clatters
over
frail
arches
,
rumbles
upon
the
heavy
ground
,
shoots
beneath
a
wooden
bridge
which
intercepts
the
light
for
a
second
like
a
wink
,
suddenly
awakens
all
the
slumbering
echoes
in
the
main
street
of
a
large
town
,
and
dashes
on
haphazard
,
pell
-
mell
,
neck
-
or
-
nothing
,
down
the
middle
of
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
There
---
with
mechanics
working
at
their
trades
,
and
people
leaning
from
their
doors
and
windows
,
and
boys
flying
kites
and
playing
marbles
,
and
men
smoking
,
and
women
talking
,
and
children
crawling
,
and
pigs
burrowing
,
and
unaccustomed
horses
plunging
and
rearing
,
close
to
the
very
rails
---
there
---
on
,
on
,
on
---
tears
the
mad
dragon
of
an
engine
with
its
train
of
cars
;
scattering
in
all
directions
a
shower
of
burning
sparks
from
its
wood
fire
;
screeching
,
hissing
,
yelling
,
panting
;
until
at
last
the
thirsty
monster
stops
beneath
a
covered
way
to
drink
,
the
people
cluster
round
,
and
you
have
time
to
breathe
again
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
met
at
the
station
at
Lowell
by
a
gentleman
intimately
connected
with
the
management
of
the
factories
there
;
and
gladly
putting
myself
under
his
guidance
,
drove
off
at
once
to
that
quarter
of
the
town
in
which
the
works
,
the
object
of
my
visit
,
were
situated
.
 
<EOS>
Although
only
just
of
age
---
for
if
my
recollection
serve
me
,
it
has
been
a
manufacturing
town
barely
one
-
and
-
twenty
years
---
Lowell
is
a
large
,
populous
,
thriving
place
.
 
<EOS>
Those
indications
of
its
youth
which
first
attract
the
eye
,
give
it
a
quaintness
and
oddity
of
character
which
,
to
a
visitor
from
the
old
country
,
is
amusing
enough
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
dirty
winter
's
day
,
and
nothing
in
the
whole
town
looked
old
to
me
,
except
the
mud
,
which
in
some
parts
was
almost
knee
-
deep
,
and
might
have
been
deposited
there
,
on
the
subsiding
of
the
waters
after
the
Deluge
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
place
,
there
was
a
new
wooden
church
,
which
,
having
no
steeple
,
and
being
yet
unpainted
,
looked
like
an
enormous
packing
-
case
without
any
direction
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
there
was
a
large
hotel
,
whose
walls
and
colonnades
were
so
crisp
,
and
thin
,
and
slight
,
that
it
had
exactly
the
appearance
of
being
built
with
cards
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
careful
not
to
draw
my
breath
as
we
passed
,
and
trembled
when
I
saw
a
workman
come
out
upon
the
roof
,
lest
with
one
thoughtless
stamp
of
his
foot
he
should
crush
the
structure
beneath
him
,
and
bring
it
rattling
down
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
river
that
moves
the
machinery
in
the
mills
(
for
they
are
all
worked
by
water
power
)
,
seems
to
acquire
a
new
character
from
the
fresh
buildings
of
bright
red
brick
and
painted
wood
among
which
it
takes
its
course
;
and
to
be
as
light
-
headed
,
thoughtless
,
and
brisk
a
young
river
,
in
its
murmurings
and
tumblings
,
as
one
would
desire
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
One
would
swear
that
every
"
Bakery
,
"
"
Grocery
,
"
and
"
Bookbindery
,
"
and
other
kind
of
store
,
took
its
shutters
down
for
the
first
time
,
and
started
in
business
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
The
golden
pestles
and
mortars
fixed
as
signs
upon
the
sun
-
blind
frames
outside
the
Druggists
'
,
 
appear
to
have
been
just
turned
out
of
the
United
States
'
Mint
;
and
when
I
saw
a
baby
of
some
week
or
ten
days
old
in
a
woman
's
arms
at
a
street
corner
,
I
found
myself
unconsciously
wondering
where
it
came
from
:
 
never
supposing
for
an
instant
that
it
could
have
been
born
in
such
a
young
town
as
that
.
   
<EOS>
There
are
several
factories
in
Lowell
,
each
of
which
belongs
to
what
we
should
term
a
Company
of
Proprietors
,
but
what
they
call
in
America
a
Corporation
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
over
several
of
these
;
such
as
a
woollen
factory
,
a
carpet
factory
,
and
a
cotton
factory
:
 
<EOS>
examined
them
in
every
part
;
and
saw
them
in
their
ordinary
working
aspect
,
with
no
preparation
of
any
kind
,
or
departure
from
their
ordinary
everyday
proceedings
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
add
that
I
am
well
acquainted
with
our
manufacturing
towns
in
England
,
and
have
visited
many
mills
in
Manchester
and
elsewhere
in
the
same
manner
.
   
<EOS>
I
happened
to
arrive
at
the
first
factory
just
as
the
dinner
hour
was
over
,
and
the
girls
were
returning
to
their
work
;
indeed
the
stairs
of
the
mill
were
thronged
with
them
as
I
ascended
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
all
well
dressed
,
but
not
to
my
thinking
above
their
condition
;
for
I
like
to
see
the
humbler
classes
of
society
careful
of
their
dress
and
appearance
,
and
even
,
if
they
please
,
decorated
with
such
little
trinkets
as
come
within
the
compass
of
their
means
.
 
<EOS>
Supposing
it
confined
within
reasonable
limits
,
I
would
always
encourage
this
kind
of
pride
,
as
a
worthy
element
of
self
-
respect
,
in
any
person
I
employed
;
and
should
no
more
be
deterred
from
doing
so
,
because
some
wretched
female
referred
her
fall
to
a
love
of
dress
,
than
I
would
allow
my
construction
of
the
real
intent
and
meaning
of
the
Sabbath
to
be
influenced
by
any
warning
to
the
well
-
disposed
,
founded
on
his
backslidings
on
that
particular
day
,
which
might
emanate
from
the
rather
doubtful
authority
of
a
murderer
in
Newgate
.
   
<EOS>
These
girls
,
as
I
have
said
,
were
all
well
dressed
:
 
and
that
phrase
necessarily
includes
extreme
cleanliness
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
serviceable
bonnets
,
good
warm
cloaks
,
and
shawls
;
and
were
not
above
clogs
and
pattens
.
 
<EOS>
Moreover
,
there
were
places
in
the
mill
in
which
they
could
deposit
these
things
without
injury
;
and
there
were
conveniences
for
washing
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
healthy
in
appearance
,
many
of
them
remarkably
so
,
and
had
the
manners
and
deportment
of
young
women
:
 
not
of
degraded
brutes
of
burden
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
seen
in
one
of
those
mills
<EOS>
(
but
I
did
not
,
though
I
looked
for
something
of
this
kind
with
a
sharp
eye
)
,
the
most
lisping
,
mincing
,
affected
,
and
ridiculous
young
creature
that
my
imagination
could
suggest
,
I
should
have
thought
of
the
careless
,
moping
,
<EOS>
slatternly
,
degraded
,
dull
reverse
(
I
HAVE
seen
that
)
,
and
should
have
been
still
well
pleased
to
look
upon
her
.
   
<EOS>
The
rooms
in
which
they
worked
,
were
as
well
ordered
as
themselves
.
<EOS>
In
the
windows
of
some
,
there
were
green
plants
,
which
were
trained
to
shade
the
glass
;
in
all
,
there
was
as
much
fresh
air
,
cleanliness
,
and
comfort
,
as
the
nature
of
the
occupation
would
possibly
admit
of
.
 
<EOS>
Out
of
so
large
a
number
of
females
,
many
of
whom
were
only
then
just
verging
upon
womanhood
,
it
may
be
reasonably
supposed
that
some
were
delicate
and
fragile
in
appearance
:
 
no
doubt
there
were
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
solemnly
declare
,
that
from
all
the
crowd
I
saw
in
the
different
factories
that
day
,
I
can
not
recall
or
separate
one
young
face
that
gave
me
a
painful
impression
;
not
one
young
girl
<EOS>
whom
,
assuming
it
to
be
a
matter
of
necessity
that
she
should
gain
her
daily
bread
by
the
labour
of
her
hands
,
I
would
have
removed
from
those
works
if
I
had
had
the
power
.
   
<EOS>
They
reside
in
various
boarding
-
houses
near
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
The
owners
of
the
mills
are
particularly
careful
to
allow
no
persons
to
enter
upon
the
possession
of
these
houses
,
whose
characters
have
not
undergone
the
most
searching
and
thorough
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
Any
complaint
that
is
made
against
them
,
by
the
boarders
,
or
by
any
one
else
,
is
fully
investigated
;
and
if
good
ground
of
complaint
be
shown
to
exist
against
them
,
they
are
removed
,
and
their
occupation
is
handed
over
to
some
more
deserving
person
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
a
few
children
employed
in
these
factories
,
but
not
many
.
 
<EOS>
The
laws
of
the
State
forbid
their
working
more
than
nine
months
in
the
year
,
and
require
that
they
be
educated
during
the
other
three
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
purpose
there
are
schools
in
Lowell
;
and
there
are
churches
and
chapels
of
various
persuasions
,
in
which
the
young
women
may
observe
that
form
of
worship
in
which
they
have
been
educated
.
   
<EOS>
At
some
distance
from
the
factories
,
and
on
the
highest
and
pleasantest
ground
in
the
neighbourhood
,
stands
their
hospital
,
or
boarding
-
house
for
the
sick
:
 
<EOS>
it
is
the
best
house
in
those
parts
,
and
was
built
by
an
eminent
merchant
for
his
own
residence
.
 
<EOS>
Like
that
institution
at
Boston
,
which
I
have
before
described
,
it
is
not
parcelled
out
into
wards
,
but
is
divided
into
convenient
chambers
,
each
of
which
has
all
the
comforts
of
a
very
comfortable
home
.
 
<EOS>
The
principal
medical
attendant
resides
under
the
same
roof
;
and
were
the
patients
members
of
his
own
family
,
they
could
not
be
better
cared
for
,
or
attended
with
greater
gentleness
and
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
The
weekly
charge
in
this
establishment
for
each
female
patient
is
three
dollars
,
or
twelve
shillings
English
;
but
no
girl
employed
by
any
of
the
corporations
is
ever
excluded
for
want
of
the
means
of
payment
.
 
<EOS>
That
they
do
not
very
often
want
the
means
,
may
be
gathered
from
the
fact
,
that
in
July
,
1841
,
no
fewer
than
nine
hundred
and
seventy
-
eight
of
these
girls
were
depositors
in
the
Lowell
Savings
Bank
:
 
<EOS>
the
amount
of
whose
joint
savings
was
estimated
at
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
,
or
twenty
thousand
English
pounds
.
   
<EOS>
I
am
now
going
to
state
three
facts
,
which
will
startle
a
large
class
of
readers
on
this
side
of
the
Atlantic
,
very
much
.
   
<EOS>
Firstly
,
there
is
a
joint
-
stock
piano
in
a
great
many
of
the
boarding
-
houses
.
 
<EOS>
Secondly
,
nearly
all
these
young
ladies
subscribe
to
circulating
libraries
.
 
<EOS>
Thirdly
,
they
have
got
up
among
themselves
a
periodical
called
THE
LOWELL
OFFERING
,
"
A
repository
of
original
articles
,
written
exclusively
by
females
actively
employed
in
the
mills
,
"
---
which
is
duly
printed
,
published
,
and
sold
;
and
whereof
I
brought
away
from
Lowell
four
hundred
good
solid
pages
,
which
I
have
read
from
beginning
to
end
.
   
<EOS>
The
large
class
of
readers
,
startled
by
these
facts
,
will
exclaim
,
with
one
voice
,
"
How
very
preposterous
!
"
 
<EOS>
On
my
deferentially
inquiring
why
,
they
will
answer
,
"
These
things
are
above
their
station
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
reply
to
that
objection
,
I
would
beg
to
ask
what
their
station
is
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
their
station
to
work
.
 
<EOS>
And
they
DO
work
.
 
<EOS>
They
labour
in
these
mills
,
upon
an
average
,
twelve
hours
a
day
,
which
is
unquestionably
work
,
and
pretty
tight
work
too
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
is
above
their
station
to
indulge
in
such
amusements
,
on
any
terms
.
<EOS>
Are
we
quite
sure
that
we
in
England
have
not
formed
our
ideas
of
the
"
station
"
of
working
people
,
from
accustoming
ourselves
to
the
contemplation
of
that
class
as
they
are
,
and
not
as
they
might
be
?
<EOS>
I
think
that
if
we
examine
our
own
feelings
,
we
shall
find
that
the
pianos
,
and
the
circulating
libraries
,
and
even
the
Lowell
Offering
,
startle
us
by
their
novelty
,
and
not
by
their
bearing
upon
any
abstract
question
of
right
or
wrong
.
   
<EOS>
For
myself
,
I
know
no
station
in
which
,
the
occupation
of
to
-
day
cheerfully
done
and
the
occupation
of
to
-
morrow
cheerfully
looked
to
,
any
one
of
these
pursuits
is
not
most
humanising
and
laudable
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
station
which
is
rendered
more
endurable
to
the
person
in
it
,
or
more
safe
to
the
person
out
of
it
,
by
having
ignorance
for
its
associate
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
no
station
which
has
a
right
to
monopolise
the
means
of
mutual
instruction
,
improvement
,
and
rational
entertainment
;
or
which
has
ever
continued
to
be
a
station
very
long
,
after
seeking
to
do
so
.
   
<EOS>
Of
the
merits
of
the
Lowell
Offering
as
a
literary
production
,
I
will
only
observe
,
putting
entirely
out
of
sight
the
fact
of
the
articles
having
been
written
by
these
girls
after
the
arduous
labours
of
the
day
,
that
it
will
compare
advantageously
with
a
great
many
English
Annuals
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
pleasant
to
find
that
many
of
its
Tales
are
of
the
Mills
and
of
those
who
work
in
them
;
that
they
inculcate
habits
of
self
-
denial
and
contentment
,
and
teach
good
doctrines
of
enlarged
benevolence
.
 
<EOS>
A
strong
feeling
for
the
beauties
of
nature
,
as
displayed
in
the
solitudes
the
writers
have
left
at
home
,
breathes
through
its
pages
like
wholesome
village
air
;
and
though
a
circulating
library
is
a
favourable
school
for
the
study
of
such
topics
,
it
has
very
scant
allusion
to
fine
clothes
,
fine
marriages
,
fine
houses
,
or
fine
life
.
 
<EOS>
Some
persons
might
object
to
the
papers
being
signed
occasionally
with
rather
fine
names
,
but
this
is
an
American
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
provinces
of
the
state
legislature
of
Massachusetts
is
to
alter
ugly
names
into
pretty
ones
,
as
the
children
improve
upon
the
tastes
of
their
parents
.
 
<EOS>
These
changes
costing
little
or
nothing
,
scores
of
Mary
Annes
are
solemnly
converted
into
Bevelinas
every
session
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
said
that
on
the
occasion
of
a
visit
from
General
Jackson
or
General
Harrison
to
this
town
(
I
forget
which
,
but
it
is
not
to
the
purpose
)
,
he
walked
through
three
miles
and
a
half
of
these
young
ladies
all
dressed
out
with
parasols
and
silk
stockings
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
I
am
not
aware
that
any
worse
consequence
ensued
,
than
a
sudden
looking
-
up
of
all
the
parasols
and
silk
stockings
in
the
market
;
and
perhaps
the
bankruptcy
of
some
speculative
New
Englander
who
bought
them
all
up
at
any
price
,
in
expectation
of
a
demand
that
never
came
;
I
set
no
great
store
by
the
circumstance
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
brief
account
of
Lowell
,
and
inadequate
expression
of
the
gratification
it
yielded
me
,
and
can
not
fail
to
afford
to
any
foreigner
to
whom
the
condition
of
such
people
at
home
is
a
subject
of
interest
and
anxious
speculation
,
I
have
carefully
abstained
from
drawing
a
comparison
between
these
factories
and
those
of
our
own
land
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
the
circumstances
whose
strong
influence
has
been
at
work
for
years
in
our
manufacturing
towns
have
not
arisen
here
;
and
there
is
no
manufacturing
population
in
Lowell
,
so
to
speak
:
 
for
these
girls
<EOS>
(
often
the
daughters
of
small
farmers
)
come
from
other
States
,
remain
a
few
years
in
the
mills
,
and
then
go
home
for
good
.
   
<EOS>
The
contrast
would
be
a
strong
one
,
for
it
would
be
between
the
Good
and
Evil
,
the
living
light
and
deepest
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
I
abstain
from
it
,
because
I
deem
it
just
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
only
the
more
earnestly
adjure
all
those
whose
eyes
may
rest
on
these
pages
,
to
pause
and
reflect
upon
the
difference
between
this
town
and
those
great
haunts
of
desperate
misery
:
 
to
call
to
mind
,
if
they
can
in
the
midst
of
party
strife
and
squabble
,
the
efforts
that
must
be
made
to
purge
them
of
their
suffering
and
danger
:
 
and
last
,
and
foremost
,
to
remember
how
the
precious
Time
is
rushing
by
.
   
<EOS>
I
returned
at
night
by
the
same
railroad
and
in
the
same
kind
of
car
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
passengers
being
exceedingly
anxious
to
expound
at
great
length
to
my
companion
(
not
to
me
,
of
course
)
<EOS>
the
true
principles
on
which
books
of
travel
in
America
should
be
written
by
Englishmen
<EOS>
,
I
feigned
to
fall
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
But
glancing
all
the
way
out
at
window
from
the
corners
of
my
eyes
,
I
found
abundance
of
entertainment
for
the
rest
of
the
ride
in
watching
the
effects
of
the
wood
fire
,
which
had
been
invisible
in
the
morning
but
were
now
brought
out
in
full
relief
by
the
darkness
:
 
for
we
were
travelling
in
a
whirlwind
of
bright
sparks
,
which
showered
about
us
like
a
storm
of
fiery
snow
.

LEAVING
Boston
on
the
afternoon
of
Saturday
the
fifth
of
February
,
we
proceeded
by
another
railroad
to
Worcester
:
 
<EOS>
a
pretty
New
England
town
,
where
we
had
arranged
to
remain
under
the
hospitable
roof
of
the
Governor
of
the
State
,
until
Monday
morning
.
   
<EOS>
These
towns
and
cities
of
New
England
(
many
of
which
would
be
villages
in
Old
England
)
,
are
as
favourable
specimens
of
rural
America
,
as
their
people
are
of
rural
Americans
.
 
<EOS>
The
well
-
trimmed
lawns
and
green
meadows
of
home
are
not
there
;
and
the
grass
,
compared
with
our
ornamental
plots
and
pastures
,
is
rank
,
and
rough
,
and
wild
:
 
but
delicate
slopes
of
land
,
gently
-
swelling
hills
,
wooded
valleys
,
and
slender
streams
,
abound
.
 
<EOS>
Every
little
colony
of
houses
has
its
church
and
school
-
house
peeping
from
among
the
white
roofs
and
shady
trees
;
every
house
is
the
whitest
of
the
white
;
every
Venetian
blind
the
greenest
of
the
green
;
every
fine
day
's
sky
<EOS>
the
bluest
of
the
blue
.
 
<EOS>
A
sharp
dry
wind
and
a
slight
frost
had
so
hardened
the
roads
when
we
alighted
at
Worcester
,
that
their
furrowed
tracks
were
like
ridges
of
granite
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
usual
aspect
of
newness
on
every
object
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
buildings
looked
as
if
they
had
been
built
and
painted
that
morning
,
and
could
be
taken
down
on
Monday
with
very
little
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
keen
evening
air
,
every
sharp
outline
looked
a
hundred
times
sharper
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
The
clean
cardboard
colonnades
had
no
more
perspective
than
a
Chinese
bridge
on
a
tea
-
cup
,
and
appeared
equally
well
calculated
for
use
.
 
<EOS>
The
razor
-
like
edges
of
the
detached
cottages
seemed
to
cut
the
very
wind
as
it
whistled
against
them
,
and
to
send
it
smarting
on
its
way
with
a
shriller
cry
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
Those
slightly
-
built
wooden
dwellings
behind
which
the
sun
was
setting
with
a
brilliant
lustre
,
could
be
so
looked
through
and
through
,
that
the
idea
of
any
inhabitant
being
able
to
hide
himself
from
the
public
gaze
,
or
to
have
any
secrets
from
the
public
eye
,
was
not
entertainable
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Even
where
a
blazing
fire
shone
through
the
uncurtained
windows
of
some
distant
house
,
it
had
the
air
of
being
newly
lighted
,
and
of
lacking
warmth
;
and
instead
of
awakening
thoughts
of
a
snug
chamber
,
bright
with
faces
that
first
saw
the
light
round
that
same
hearth
,
and
ruddy
with
warm
hangings
,
it
came
upon
one
suggestive
of
the
smell
of
new
mortar
and
damp
walls
.
   
<EOS>
So
I
thought
,
at
least
,
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Next
morning
when
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
,
and
the
clear
church
bells
were
ringing
,
and
sedate
people
in
their
best
clothes
enlivened
the
pathway
near
at
hand
and
dotted
the
distant
thread
of
road
,
there
was
a
pleasant
Sabbath
peacefulness
on
everything
,
which
it
was
good
to
feel
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
the
better
for
an
old
church
;
better
still
for
some
old
graves
;
but
as
it
was
,
a
wholesome
repose
and
tranquillity
pervaded
the
scene
,
which
after
the
restless
ocean
and
the
hurried
city
,
had
a
doubly
grateful
influence
on
the
spirits
.
   
<EOS>
We
went
on
next
morning
,
still
by
railroad
,
to
Springfield
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
place
to
Hartford
,
whither
we
were
bound
,
is
a
distance
of
only
five
-
and
-
twenty
miles
,
but
at
that
time
of
the
year
the
roads
were
so
bad
that
the
journey
would
probably
have
occupied
ten
or
twelve
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
however
,
the
winter
having
been
unusually
mild
,
the
Connecticut
River
was
"
open
,
"
or
,
in
other
words
,
not
frozen
.
 
<EOS>
The
captain
of
a
small
steamboat
was
going
to
make
his
first
trip
for
the
season
that
day
(
the
second
February
trip
,
I
believe
,
within
the
memory
of
man
)
,
and
only
waited
for
us
to
go
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
we
went
on
board
,
with
as
little
delay
as
might
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
as
good
as
his
word
,
and
started
directly
.
   
<EOS>
It
certainly
was
not
called
a
small
steamboat
without
reason
.
 
<EOS>
I
omitted
to
ask
the
question
,
but
I
should
think
it
must
have
been
of
about
half
a
pony
power
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Paap
,
the
celebrated
Dwarf
,
might
have
lived
and
died
happily
in
the
cabin
,
which
was
fitted
with
common
sash
-
windows
like
an
ordinary
dwelling
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
These
windows
had
bright
-
red
curtains
,
too
,
hung
on
slack
strings
across
the
lower
panes
;
so
that
it
looked
like
the
parlour
of
a
Lilliputian
public
-
house
,
which
had
got
afloat
in
a
flood
or
some
other
water
accident
,
and
was
drifting
nobody
knew
where
.
 
<EOS>
But
even
in
this
chamber
there
was
a
rocking
-
chair
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
impossible
to
get
on
anywhere
,
in
America
,
without
a
rocking
-
chair
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
to
tell
how
many
feet
short
this
vessel
was
,
or
how
many
feet
narrow
:
to
apply
the
words
length
and
width
to
such
measurement
would
be
a
contradiction
in
terms
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
may
state
that
we
all
kept
the
middle
of
the
deck
,
lest
the
boat
should
unexpectedly
tip
over
;
and
that
the
machinery
,
by
some
surprising
process
of
condensation
,
worked
between
it
and
the
keel
:
 
the
whole
forming
a
warm
sandwich
,
about
three
feet
thick
.
   
<EOS>
It
rained
all
day
as
I
once
thought
it
never
did
rain
anywhere
,
but
in
the
Highlands
of
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
The
river
was
full
of
floating
blocks
of
ice
,
which
were
constantly
crunching
and
cracking
under
us
;
and
the
depth
of
water
,
in
the
course
we
took
to
avoid
the
larger
masses
,
carried
down
the
middle
of
the
river
by
the
current
,
did
not
exceed
a
few
inches
.
 
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
we
moved
onward
,
dexterously
;
and
being
well
wrapped
up
,
bade
defiance
to
the
weather
,
and
enjoyed
the
journey
.
 
<EOS>
The
Connecticut
River
is
a
fine
stream
;
and
the
banks
in
summer
-
time
are
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
beautiful
;
at
all
events
,
I
was
told
so
by
a
young
lady
in
the
cabin
;
and
she
should
be
a
judge
of
beauty
,
if
the
possession
of
a
quality
include
the
appreciation
of
it
,
for
a
more
beautiful
creature
I
never
looked
upon
.
   
<EOS>
After
two
hours
and
a
half
of
this
odd
travelling
(
including
a
stoppage
at
a
small
town
,
where
we
were
saluted
by
a
gun
considerably
bigger
than
our
own
chimney
)
,
we
reached
Hartford
,
and
straightway
repaired
to
an
extremely
comfortable
hotel
:
 
except
,
as
usual
,
in
the
article
of
bedrooms
,
which
,
in
almost
every
place
we
visited
,
were
very
conducive
to
early
rising
.
   
<EOS>
We
tarried
here
,
four
days
.
 
<EOS>
The
town
is
beautifully
situated
in
a
basin
of
green
hills
;
the
soil
is
rich
,
well
-
wooded
,
and
carefully
improved
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
seat
of
the
local
legislature
of
Connecticut
,
which
sage
body
enacted
,
in
bygone
times
,
the
renowned
code
of
"
Blue
Laws
,
"
in
virtue
whereof
,
among
other
enlightened
provisions
,
any
citizen
who
could
be
proved
to
have
kissed
his
wife
on
Sunday
,
was
punishable
,
I
believe
,
with
the
stocks
.
 
<EOS>
Too
much
of
the
old
Puritan
spirit
exists
in
these
parts
to
the
present
hour
;
but
its
influence
has
not
tended
,
that
I
know
,
to
make
the
people
less
hard
in
their
bargains
,
or
more
equal
in
their
dealings
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
never
heard
of
its
working
that
effect
anywhere
else
,
I
infer
that
it
never
will
,
here
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
am
accustomed
,
with
reference
to
great
professions
and
severe
faces
,
to
judge
of
the
goods
of
the
other
world
pretty
much
as
I
judge
of
the
goods
of
this
;
and
whenever
I
see
a
dealer
in
such
commodities
with
too
great
a
display
of
them
in
his
window
,
I
doubt
the
quality
of
the
article
within
.
   
<EOS>
In
Hartford
stands
the
famous
oak
in
which
the
charter
of
King
Charles
was
hidden
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
now
inclosed
in
a
gentleman
's
garden
.
<EOS>
In
the
State
House
is
the
charter
itself
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
the
courts
of
law
here
,
just
the
same
as
at
Boston
;
the
public
institutions
almost
as
good
.
 
<EOS>
The
Insane
Asylum
is
admirably
conducted
,
and
so
is
the
Institution
for
the
Deaf
and
Dumb
.
   
<EOS>
I
very
much
questioned
within
myself
,
as
I
walked
through
the
Insane
Asylum
,
whether
I
should
have
known
the
attendants
from
the
patients
,
but
for
the
few
words
which
passed
between
the
former
,
and
the
Doctor
,
in
reference
to
the
persons
under
their
charge
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
I
limit
this
remark
merely
to
their
looks
;
for
the
conversation
of
the
mad
people
was
mad
enough
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
one
little
,
prim
old
lady
,
of
very
smiling
and
good
-
humoured
appearance
,
who
came
sidling
up
to
me
from
the
end
of
a
long
passage
,
and
with
a
curtsey
of
inexpressible
condescension
,
propounded
this
unaccountable
inquiry
:
   
"
Does
Pontefract
still
flourish
,
sir
,
upon
the
soil
of
England
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
does
,
ma'am
,
"
I
rejoined
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
you
last
saw
him
,
sir
,
he
was
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Well
,
ma'am
,
"
said
I
,
"
extremely
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
begged
me
to
present
his
compliments
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
him
looking
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
,
the
old
lady
was
very
much
delighted
.
 
<EOS>
After
glancing
at
me
for
a
moment
,
as
if
to
be
quite
sure
that
I
was
serious
in
my
respectful
air
,
she
sidled
back
some
paces
;
sidled
forward
again
;
made
a
sudden
skip
(
at
which
I
precipitately
retreated
a
step
or
two
)
;
and
said
:
   
"
I
am
an
antediluvian
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
thought
the
best
thing
to
say
was
,
that
I
had
suspected
as
much
from
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
said
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
an
extremely
proud
and
pleasant
thing
,
sir
,
to
be
an
antediluvian
,
"
said
the
old
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
it
was
,
ma'am
,
"
I
rejoined
.
   
<EOS>
The
old
lady
kissed
her
hand
,
gave
another
skip
,
smirked
and
sidled
down
the
gallery
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
,
and
ambled
gracefully
into
her
own
bed
-
chamber
.
   
<EOS>
In
another
part
of
the
building
,
there
was
a
male
patient
in
bed
;
very
much
flushed
and
heated
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
he
,
starting
up
,
and
pulling
off
his
night
-
cap
:
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
settled
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
arranged
it
with
Queen
Victoria
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Arranged
what
?
"
asked
the
Doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
that
business
,
"
passing
his
hand
wearily
across
his
forehead
,
"
about
the
siege
of
New
York
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
I
,
like
a
man
suddenly
enlightened
.
 
<EOS>
For
he
looked
at
me
for
an
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Every
house
without
a
signal
will
be
fired
upon
by
the
British
troops
.
 
<EOS>
No
harm
will
be
done
to
the
others
.
 
<EOS>
No
harm
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Those
that
want
to
be
safe
,
must
hoist
flags
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
they
'll
have
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
They
must
hoist
flags
.
"
   
<EOS>
Even
while
he
was
speaking
he
seemed
,
I
thought
,
to
have
some
faint
idea
that
his
talk
was
incoherent
.
 
<EOS>
Directly
he
had
said
these
words
,
he
lay
down
again
;
gave
a
kind
of
a
groan
;
and
covered
his
hot
head
with
the
blankets
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
another
:
 
a
young
man
,
whose
madness
was
love
and
music
.
<EOS>
After
playing
on
the
accordion
a
march
he
had
composed
,
he
was
very
anxious
that
I
should
walk
into
his
chamber
,
which
I
immediately
did
.
   
<EOS>
By
way
of
being
very
knowing
,
and
humouring
him
to
the
top
of
his
bent
,
I
went
to
the
window
,
which
commanded
a
beautiful
prospect
,
and
remarked
,
with
an
address
upon
which
I
greatly
plumed
myself
:
   
"
What
a
delicious
country
you
have
about
these
lodgings
of
yours
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Poh
!
"
said
he
,
moving
his
fingers
carelessly
over
the
notes
of
his
instrument
:
 
"
WELL
ENOUGH
FOR
SUCH
AN
INSTITUTION
AS
THIS
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
was
ever
so
taken
aback
in
all
my
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
come
here
just
for
a
whim
,
"
he
said
coolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
!
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
Doctor
's
a
smart
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
quite
enters
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
joke
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
it
for
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
n't
mention
it
,
but
I
think
I
shall
go
out
next
Tuesday
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
assured
him
that
I
would
consider
our
interview
perfectly
confidential
;
and
rejoined
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
were
passing
through
a
gallery
on
our
way
out
,
a
well
-
dressed
lady
,
of
quiet
and
composed
manners
,
came
up
,
and
proffering
a
slip
of
paper
and
a
pen
,
begged
that
I
would
oblige
her
with
an
autograph
,
I
complied
,
and
we
parted
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
remember
having
had
a
few
interviews
like
that
,
with
ladies
out
of
doors
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
SHE
is
not
mad
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
what
subject
?
 
<EOS>
Autographs
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
She
hears
voices
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
thought
I
,
"
it
would
be
well
if
we
could
shut
up
a
few
false
prophets
of
these
later
times
,
who
have
professed
to
do
the
same
;
and
I
should
like
to
try
the
experiment
on
a
Mormonist
or
two
to
begin
with
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
this
place
,
there
is
the
best
jail
for
untried
offenders
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
also
a
very
well
-
ordered
State
prison
,
arranged
upon
the
same
plan
as
that
at
Boston
,
except
<EOS>
that
here
,
there
is
always
a
sentry
on
the
wall
with
a
loaded
gun
.
 
<EOS>
It
contained
at
that
time
about
two
hundred
prisoners
.
 
<EOS>
A
spot
was
shown
me
in
the
sleeping
ward
,
where
a
watchman
was
murdered
some
years
since
in
the
dead
of
night
,
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
escape
,
made
by
a
prisoner
who
had
broken
from
his
cell
.
 
<EOS>
A
woman
,
too
,
was
pointed
out
to
me
,
who
,
for
the
murder
of
her
husband
,
had
been
a
close
prisoner
for
sixteen
years
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
,
"
I
asked
of
my
conductor
,
"
that
after
so
very
long
an
imprisonment
,
she
has
any
thought
or
hope
of
ever
regaining
her
liberty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
<EOS>
yes
,
"
he
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
she
has
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
has
no
chance
of
obtaining
it
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
:
"
which
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
is
a
national
answer
.
"
<EOS>
Her
friends
mistrust
her
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
have
THEY
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
naturally
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
they
wo
n't
petition
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
if
they
did
,
they
could
n't
get
her
out
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
not
the
first
time
,
perhaps
,
nor
yet
the
second
,
but
tiring
and
wearying
for
a
few
years
might
do
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
that
ever
do
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
yes
,
that
'll
do
it
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
Political
friends'll
do
it
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
pretty
often
done
,
one
way
or
another
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
shall
always
entertain
a
very
pleasant
and
grateful
recollection
of
Hartford
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
lovely
place
,
and
I
had
many
friends
there
,
whom
I
can
never
remember
with
indifference
.
 
<EOS>
We
left
it
with
no
little
regret
on
the
evening
of
Friday
the
11th
,
and
travelled
that
night
by
railroad
to
New
Haven
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
the
way
,
the
guard
and
I
were
formally
introduced
to
each
other
(
as
we
usually
were
on
such
occasions
)
,
and
exchanged
a
variety
of
small
-
talk
.
 
<EOS>
We
reached
New
Haven
at
about
eight
o'clock
,
after
a
journey
of
three
hours
,
and
put
up
for
the
night
at
the
best
inn
.
   
<EOS>
New
Haven
,
known
also
as
the
City
of
Elms
,
is
a
fine
town
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
its
streets
(
as
its
ALIAS
sufficiently
imports
)
are
planted
with
rows
of
grand
old
elm
-
trees
;
and
the
same
natural
ornaments
surround
Yale
College
,
an
establishment
of
considerable
eminence
and
reputation
.
 
<EOS>
The
various
departments
of
this
Institution
are
erected
in
a
kind
of
park
or
common
in
the
middle
of
the
town
,
where
they
are
dimly
visible
among
the
shadowing
trees
.
 
<EOS>
The
effect
is
very
like
that
of
an
old
cathedral
yard
in
England
;
and
when
their
branches
are
in
full
leaf
,
must
be
extremely
picturesque
.
<EOS>
Even
in
the
winter
time
,
these
groups
of
well
-
grown
trees
,
clustering
among
the
busy
streets
and
houses
of
a
thriving
city
,
have
a
very
quaint
appearance
:
 
seeming
to
bring
about
a
kind
of
compromise
between
town
and
country
;
as
if
each
had
met
the
other
half
-
way
,
and
shaken
hands
upon
it
;
which
is
at
once
novel
and
pleasant
.
   
<EOS>
After
a
night
's
rest
,
we
rose
early
,
and
in
good
time
went
down
to
the
wharf
,
and
on
board
the
packet
New
York
FOR
New
York
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
first
American
steamboat
of
any
size
that
I
had
seen
;
and
certainly
to
an
English
eye
it
was
infinitely
less
like
a
steamboat
than
a
huge
floating
bath
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
persuade
myself
,
indeed
,
but
that
the
bathing
establishment
off
Westminster
Bridge
,
which
I
left
a
baby
,
had
suddenly
grown
to
an
enormous
size
;
run
away
from
home
;
and
set
up
in
foreign
parts
as
a
steamer
.
 
<EOS>
Being
in
America
,
too
,
which
our
vagabonds
do
so
particularly
favour
<EOS>
,
it
seemed
the
more
probable
.
   
<EOS>
The
great
difference
in
appearance
between
these
packets
and
ours
,
is
,
that
there
is
so
much
of
them
out
of
the
water
:
 
<EOS>
the
main
-
deck
being
enclosed
on
all
sides
,
and
filled
with
casks
and
goods
,
like
any
second
or
third
floor
in
a
stack
of
warehouses
;
and
the
promenade
or
hurricane
-
deck
being
a
-
top
of
that
again
.
 
<EOS>
A
part
of
the
machinery
is
always
above
this
deck
;
where
the
connecting
-
rod
,
in
a
strong
and
lofty
frame
,
is
seen
working
away
like
an
iron
top
-
sawyer
.
<EOS>
There
is
seldom
any
mast
or
tackle
:
 
nothing
aloft
but
two
tall
black
chimneys
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
at
the
helm
is
shut
up
in
a
little
house
in
the
fore
part
of
the
boat
(
the
wheel
being
connected
with
the
rudder
by
iron
chains
,
working
the
whole
length
of
the
deck
)
;
and
the
passengers
,
unless
the
weather
be
very
fine
indeed
,
usually
congregate
below
.
 
<EOS>
Directly
you
have
left
the
wharf
,
all
the
life
,
and
stir
,
and
bustle
of
a
packet
cease
.
 
<EOS>
You
wonder
for
a
long
time
how
she
goes
on
,
for
there
seems
to
be
nobody
in
charge
of
her
;
and
when
another
of
these
dull
machines
comes
splashing
by
<EOS>
,
you
feel
quite
indignant
with
it
,
as
a
sullen
cumbrous
,
ungraceful
,
unshiplike
leviathan
:
 
quite
forgetting
that
the
vessel
you
are
on
board
of
,
is
its
very
counterpart
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
always
a
clerk
's
office
on
the
lower
deck
,
where
you
pay
your
fare
;
a
ladies
'
cabin
;
baggage
and
stowage
rooms
;
engineer
's
room
;
and
in
short
a
great
variety
of
perplexities
which
render
the
discovery
of
the
gentlemen
's
cabin
,
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
.
<EOS>
It
often
occupies
the
whole
length
of
the
boat
(
as
it
did
in
this
case
)
,
and
has
three
or
four
tiers
of
berths
on
each
side
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
first
descended
into
the
cabin
of
the
New
York
,
it
looked
,
in
my
unaccustomed
eyes
,
about
as
long
as
the
Burlington
Arcade
.
   
<EOS>
The
Sound
which
has
to
be
crossed
on
this
passage
,
is
not
always
a
very
safe
or
pleasant
navigation
,
and
has
been
the
scene
of
some
unfortunate
accidents
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
wet
morning
,
and
very
misty
,
and
we
soon
lost
sight
of
land
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
was
calm
,
however
,
and
brightened
towards
noon
.
 
<EOS>
After
exhausting
(
with
good
help
from
a
friend
)
the
larder
,
and
the
stock
of
bottled
beer
,
I
lay
down
to
sleep
;
being
very
much
tired
with
the
fatigues
of
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
woke
from
my
nap
in
time
to
hurry
up
,
and
see
Hell
Gate
,
the
Hog
's
Back
,
the
Frying
Pan
,
and
other
notorious
localities
,
attractive
to
all
readers
of
famous
Diedrich
Knickerbocker
's
History
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
now
in
a
narrow
channel
,
with
sloping
banks
on
either
side
,
besprinkled
with
pleasant
villas
,
and
made
refreshing
to
the
sight
by
turf
and
trees
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
we
shot
in
quick
succession
,
past
a
lighthouse
;
 
<EOS>
a
madhouse
(
how
the
lunatics
flung
up
their
caps
and
roared
in
sympathy
with
the
headlong
engine
and
the
driving
tide
!
)
;
a
jail
;
and
other
buildings
:
 
and
so
emerged
into
a
noble
bay
,
whose
waters
sparkled
in
the
now
cloudless
sunshine
like
Nature
's
eyes
turned
up
to
Heaven
.
   
<EOS>
Then
there
lay
stretched
out
before
us
,
to
the
right
,
confused
heaps
of
buildings
,
with
here
and
there
a
spire
or
steeple
,
looking
down
upon
the
herd
below
;
and
here
and
there
,
again
,
a
cloud
of
lazy
smoke
;
and
in
the
foreground
a
forest
of
ships
'
masts
,
cheery
with
flapping
sails
and
waving
flags
.
 
<EOS>
Crossing
from
among
them
to
the
opposite
shore
,
were
steam
ferry
-
boats
laden
with
people
,
coaches
,
horses
,
waggons
,
baskets
,
<EOS>
boxes
:
 
crossed
and
recrossed
by
other
ferry
-
boats
:
 
all
travelling
to
and
fro
:
 
and
never
idle
.
<EOS>
Stately
among
these
restless
Insects
,
were
two
or
three
large
ships
,
moving
with
slow
majestic
pace
,
as
creatures
of
a
prouder
kind
,
disdainful
of
their
puny
journeys
,
and
making
for
the
broad
sea
.
 
<EOS>
Beyond
,
were
shining
heights
,
and
islands
in
the
glancing
river
,
and
a
distance
scarcely
less
blue
and
bright
than
the
sky
it
seemed
to
meet
.
 
<EOS>
The
city
's
hum
and
buzz
,
the
clinking
of
capstans
,
the
ringing
of
bells
,
the
barking
of
dogs
,
the
clattering
of
wheels
,
tingled
in
the
listening
ear
.
 
<EOS>
All
of
which
life
and
stir
,
coming
across
the
stirring
water
,
caught
new
life
and
animation
from
its
free
companionship
;
and
,
sympathising
with
its
buoyant
spirits
,
glistened
as
it
seemed
in
sport
upon
its
surface
,
and
hemmed
the
vessel
round
,
and
plashed
the
water
high
about
her
sides
,
and
,
floating
her
gallantly
into
the
dock
,
flew
off
again
to
welcome
other
comers
,
and
speed
before
them
to
the
busy
port
.

New
York
 
<EOS>
THE
beautiful
metropolis
of
America
is
by
no
means
so
clean
a
city
as
Boston
,
but
many
of
its
streets
have
the
same
characteristics
;
except
that
the
houses
are
not
quite
so
fresh
-
coloured
,
the
sign
-
boards
are
not
quite
so
gaudy
,
<EOS>
the
gilded
letters
not
quite
so
golden
,
the
bricks
not
quite
so
red
,
the
stone
not
quite
so
white
,
the
blinds
and
area
railings
not
quite
so
green
,
the
knobs
and
plates
upon
the
street
doors
not
quite
so
bright
and
twinkling
.
<EOS>
There
are
many
by
-
streets
,
almost
as
neutral
in
clean
colours
,
and
positive
in
dirty
ones
,
as
by
-
streets
in
London
;
and
there
is
one
quarter
,
commonly
called
the
Five
Points
,

in
respect
of
filth

wretchedness

famed
St

The
great
promenade
and
thoroughfare
,
as
most
people
know
,
is
Broadway
;
a
wide
and
bustling
street
,
which
,
from
the
Battery
Gardens
to
its
opposite
termination
in
a
country
road
,
may
be
four
miles
long
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
we
sit
down
in
an
upper
floor
of
the
Carlton
House
Hotel
(
situated
in
the
best
part
of
this
main
artery
of
New
York
)
,
and
when
we
are
tired
of
looking
down
upon
the
life
below
,
sally
forth
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
and
mingle
with
the
stream
?
   
<EOS>
Warm
weather
!
 
<EOS>
The
sun
strikes
upon
our
heads
at
this
open
window
,
as
though
its
rays
were
concentrated
through
a
burning
-
glass
;
but
the
day
is
in
its
zenith
,
and
the
season
an
unusual
one
.
 
<EOS>
Was
there
ever
such
a
sunny
street
as
this
Broadway
!
 
<EOS>
The
pavement
stones
are
polished
with
the
tread
of
feet
until
they
shine
again
;
the
red
bricks
of
the
houses
might
be
yet
in
the
dry
,
hot
kilns
;
and
the
roofs
of
those
omnibuses
look
as
though
,
if
water
were
poured
on
them
,
they
would
hiss
and
smoke
,
and
smell
like
half
-
quenched
fires
.
 
<EOS>
No
stint
of
omnibuses
here
!
 
<EOS>
Half
-
a
-
dozen
have
gone
by
within
as
many
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
Plenty
of
hackney
cabs
and
coaches
too
;
gigs
,
phaetons
,
large
-
wheeled
tilburies
,
and
private
carriages
---
rather
of
a
clumsy
make
,
and
not
very
different
from
the
public
vehicles
,
but
built
for
the
heavy
roads
beyond
the
city
pavement
.
<EOS>
Negro
coachmen
and
white
;
in
straw
hats
,
black
hats
,
white
hats
,
glazed
caps
,
fur
caps
;
in
coats
of
drab
,
black
,
brown
,
green
,
blue
,
nankeen
,
striped
jean
and
linen
;
and
there
,
in
that
one
instance
(
look
while
it
passes
,
or
it
will
be
too
late
)
,
in
suits
of
livery
.
<EOS>
Some
southern
republican
that
,
who
puts
his
blacks
in
uniform
,
and
swells
with
Sultan
pomp
and
power
.
 
<EOS>
Yonder
,
where
that
phaeton
with
the
well
-
clipped
pair
of
grays
has
stopped
---
standing
at
their
heads
now
---
is
a
Yorkshire
groom
,
who
has
not
been
very
long
in
these
parts
,
and
looks
sorrowfully
round
for
a
companion
pair
of
top
-
boots
,
which
he
may
traverse
the
city
half
a
year
without
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
save
the
ladies
,
how
they
dress
!
 
<EOS>
We
have
seen
more
colours
in
these
ten
minutes
,
than
we
should
have
seen
elsewhere
,
in
as
many
days
.
 
<EOS>
What
various
parasols
!
<EOS>
what
rainbow
silks
and
satins
!
<EOS>
what
pinking
of
thin
stockings
,
and
pinching
of
thin
shoes
,
and
fluttering
of
ribbons
and
silk
tassels
,
and
display
of
rich
cloaks
with
gaudy
hoods
and
linings
!
 
<EOS>
The
young
gentlemen
are
fond
,
you
see
,
of
turning
down
their
shirt
-
collars
and
cultivating
their
whiskers
,
especially
under
the
chin
;
but
they
can
not
approach
the
ladies
in
their
dress
or
bearing
,
being
,
to
say
the
truth
,
humanity
of
quite
another
sort
.
 
<EOS>
Byrons
of
the
desk
and
counter
,
pass
on
,
and
let
us
see
what
kind
of
men
those
are
behind
ye
:
 
those
two
labourers
in
holiday
clothes
,
of
whom
one
carries
in
his
hand
a
crumpled
scrap
of
paper
from
which
he
tries
to
spell
out
a
hard
name
,
while
the
other
looks
about
for
it
on
all
the
doors
and
windows
.
   
<EOS>
Irishmen
both
!
 
<EOS>
You
might
know
them
,
if
they
were
masked
,
by
their
long
-
tailed
blue
coats
and
bright
buttons
,
and
their
drab
trousers
,
which
they
wear
like
men
well
used
to
working
dresses
,
who
are
easy
in
no
others
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
hard
to
keep
your
model
republics
going
,
without
the
countrymen
and
countrywomen
of
those
two
labourers
.
<EOS>
For
who
else
would
dig
,
and
delve
,
and
drudge
,
and
do
domestic
work
,
and
make
canals
and
roads
,
and
execute
great
lines
of
Internal
Improvement
!
 
<EOS>
Irishmen
both
,
and
sorely
puzzled
too
,
to
find
out
what
they
seek
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
go
down
,
and
help
them
,
for
the
love
of
home
,
and
that
spirit
of
liberty
which
admits
of
honest
service
to
honest
men
,
and
honest
work
for
honest
bread
,
no
matter
what
it
be
.
   
<EOS>
That
's
well
!
 
<EOS>
We
have
got
at
the
right
address
at
last
,
though
it
is
written
in
strange
characters
truly
,
and
might
have
been
scrawled
with
the
blunt
handle
of
the
spade
<EOS>
the
writer
better
knows
the
use
of
,
than
a
pen
.
 
<EOS>
Their
way
lies
yonder
,
but
what
business
takes
them
there
?
 
<EOS>
They
carry
savings
:
 
to
hoard
up
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
brothers
,
those
men
.
 
<EOS>
One
crossed
the
sea
alone
,
and
working
very
hard
for
one
half
year
,
and
living
harder
,
saved
funds
enough
to
bring
the
other
out
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
they
worked
together
side
by
side
,
contentedly
sharing
hard
labour
and
hard
living
for
another
term
,
and
then
their
sisters
came
,
and
then
another
brother
,
and
lastly
,
their
old
mother
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
now
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
the
poor
old
crone
is
restless
in
a
strange
land
,
and
yearns
to
lay
her
bones
,
she
says
,
among
her
people
in
the
old
graveyard
at
home
:
 
<EOS>
and
so
they
go
to
pay
her
passage
back
:
 
and
God
help
her
and
them
,
and
every
simple
heart
,
and
all
who
turn
to
the
Jerusalem
of
their
younger
days
,
and
have
an
altar
-
fire
upon
the
cold
hearth
of
their
fathers
.
   
<EOS>
This
narrow
thoroughfare
,
baking
and
blistering
in
the
sun
,
is
Wall
Street
:
 
<EOS>
the
Stock
Exchange
and
Lombard
Street
of
New
York
.
 
<EOS>
Many
a
rapid
fortune
has
been
made
in
this
street
,
and
many
a
no
less
rapid
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
these
very
merchants
whom
you
see
hanging
about
here
now
,
have
locked
up
money
in
their
strong
-
boxes
,
like
the
man
in
the
Arabian
Nights
,
and
opening
them
again
,
have
found
but
withered
leaves
.
 
<EOS>
Below
,
here
by
the
water
-
side
,
where
the
bowsprits
of
ships
stretch
across
the
footway
,
and
almost
thrust
themselves
into
the
windows
,
lie
the
noble
American
vessels
which
having
made
their
Packet
Service
the
finest
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
brought
hither
the
foreigners
who
abound
in
all
the
streets
:
<EOS>
not
,
perhaps
,
that
there
are
more
here
,
than
in
other
commercial
cities
;
but
elsewhere
,
they
have
particular
haunts
,
and
you
must
find
them
out
;
here
,
they
pervade
the
town
.
   
<EOS>
We
must
cross
Broadway
again
;
gaining
some
refreshment
from
the
heat
,
in
the
sight
of
the
great
blocks
of
clean
ice
which
are
being
carried
into
shops
and
bar
-
rooms
;
and
the
pine
-
apples
and
water
-
melons
profusely
displayed
for
sale
.
 
<EOS>
Fine
streets
of
spacious
houses
here
,
you
see
!
<EOS>
---
Wall
Street
has
furnished
and
dismantled
many
of
them
very
often
---
and
here
a
deep
green
leafy
square
.
 
<EOS>
Be
sure
that
is
a
hospitable
house
with
inmates
to
be
affectionately
remembered
always
,
where
they
have
the
open
door
and
pretty
show
of
plants
within
,
and
where
the
child
with
laughing
eyes
is
peeping
out
of
window
at
the
little
dog
below
.
 
<EOS>
You
wonder
what
may
be
the
use
of
this
tall
flagstaff
in
the
by
-
street
,
with
something
like
Liberty
's
head
-
dress
on
its
top
:
 
so
do
I.
 
<EOS>
But
there
is
a
passion
for
tall
flagstaffs
hereabout
,
and
you
may
see
its
twin
brother
in
five
minutes
,
if
you
have
a
mind
.
   
<EOS>
Again
across
Broadway
,
and
so
---
passing
from
the
many
-
coloured
crowd
and
glittering
shops
---
into
another
long
main
street
,
the
Bowery
.
 
<EOS>
A
railroad
yonder
,
see
,
where
two
stout
horses
trot
along
,
drawing
a
score
or
two
of
people
and
a
great
wooden
ark
,
with
ease
.
<EOS>
The
stores
are
poorer
here
;
the
passengers
less
gay
.
 
<EOS>
Clothes
ready
-
made
,
and
meat
ready
-
cooked
,
are
to
be
bought
in
these
parts
;
and
the
lively
whirl
of
carriages
is
exchanged
for
the
deep
rumble
of
carts
and
waggons
.
 
<EOS>
These
signs
which
are
so
plentiful
,
in
shape
like
river
buoys
,
or
small
balloons
,
hoisted
by
cords
to
poles
,
and
dangling
there
,
announce
,
as
you
may
see
by
looking
up
,
"
OYSTERS
IN
EVERY
STYLE
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
tempt
the
hungry
most
at
night
,
for
then
dull
candles
glimmering
inside
,
illuminate
these
dainty
words
,
and
make
the
mouths
of
idlers
water
,
as
they
read
and
linger
.
   
<EOS>
What
is
this
dismal
-
fronted
pile
of
bastard
Egyptian
,
like
an
enchanter
's
palace
in
a
melodrama
!
<EOS>
---
a
famous
prison
,
called
The
Tombs
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
we
go
in
?
   
<EOS>
So
.
 
<EOS>
A
long
,
narrow
,
lofty
building
,
stove
-
heated
as
usual
,
with
four
galleries
,
one
above
the
other
,
going
round
it
,
and
communicating
by
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
Between
the
two
sides
of
each
gallery
,
and
in
its
centre
,
a
bridge
,
for
the
greater
convenience
of
crossing
.
 
<EOS>
On
each
of
these
bridges
sits
a
man
:
 
dozing
or
reading
,
or
talking
to
an
idle
companion
.
 
<EOS>
On
each
tier
,
are
two
opposite
rows
of
small
iron
doors
.
 
<EOS>
They
look
like
furnace
-
doors
,
but
are
cold
and
black
,
as
though
the
fires
within
had
all
gone
out
.
 
<EOS>
Some
two
or
three
are
open
,
and
women
,
with
drooping
heads
bent
down
,
are
talking
to
the
inmates
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
is
lighted
by
a
skylight
,
but
it
is
fast
closed
;
and
from
the
roof
there
dangle
,
limp
and
drooping
,
two
useless
windsails
.
   
<EOS>
A
man
with
keys
appears
,
to
show
us
round
.
 
<EOS>
A
good
-
looking
fellow
,
and
,
in
his
way
,
civil
and
obliging
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
those
black
doors
the
cells
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
they
all
full
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
they
're
pretty
nigh
full
,
and
that
's
a
fact
,
and
no
two
ways
about
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Those
at
the
bottom
are
unwholesome
,
surely
?
"
   
"
Why
,
we
DO
only
put
coloured
people
in
'em
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
do
the
prisoners
take
exercise
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
they
do
without
it
pretty
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
they
never
walk
in
the
yard
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Considerable
seldom
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sometimes
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
it
's
rare
they
do
.
 
<EOS>
They
keep
pretty
bright
without
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
suppose
a
man
were
here
for
a
twelvemonth
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
this
is
only
a
prison
for
criminals
who
are
charged
with
grave
offences
,
while
they
are
awaiting
their
trial
,
or
under
remand
,
but
the
law
here
affords
criminals
<EOS>
many
means
of
delay
.
 
<EOS>
What
with
motions
for
new
trials
,
and
in
arrest
of
judgment
,
and
what
not
,
a
prisoner
might
be
here
for
twelve
months
,
I
take
it
,
might
he
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
guess
he
might
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
say
that
in
all
that
time
he
would
never
come
out
at
that
little
iron
door
,
for
exercise
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
might
walk
some
,
perhaps
---
not
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
open
one
of
the
doors
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
,
if
you
like
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
fastenings
jar
and
rattle
,
and
one
of
the
doors
turns
slowly
on
its
hinges
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
look
in
.
 
<EOS>
A
small
bare
cell
,
into
which
the
light
enters
through
a
high
chink
in
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
rude
means
of
washing
,
a
table
,
and
a
bedstead
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
the
latter
,
sits
a
man
of
sixty
;
reading
.
 
<EOS>
He
looks
up
for
a
moment
;
gives
an
impatient
dogged
shake
;
and
fixes
his
eyes
upon
his
book
again
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
withdraw
our
heads
,
the
door
closes
on
him
,
and
is
fastened
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
This
man
has
murdered
his
wife
,
and
will
probably
be
hanged
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
long
has
he
been
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
month
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
will
he
be
tried
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Next
term
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
is
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Next
month
.
"
   
"
In
England
,
if
a
man
be
under
sentence
of
death
,
even
he
has
air
and
exercise
at
certain
periods
of
the
day
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Possible
?
"
   
<EOS>
With
what
stupendous
and
untranslatable
coolness
he
says
this
,
and
how
loungingly
he
leads
on
to
the
women
's
side
:
 
<EOS>
making
,
as
he
goes
,
a
kind
of
iron
castanet
of
the
key
and
the
stair
-
rail
!
   
<EOS>
Each
cell
door
on
this
side
has
a
square
aperture
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
women
peep
anxiously
through
it
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
;
others
shrink
away
in
shame
.
<EOS>
---
For
what
offence
can
that
lonely
child
,
of
ten
or
twelve
years
old
,
be
shut
up
here
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
boy
?
<EOS>
He
is
the
son
of
the
prisoner
we
saw
just
now
;
is
a
witness
against
his
father
;
and
is
detained
here
for
safe
keeping
,
until
the
trial
;
that
's
all
.
   
<EOS>
But
it
is
a
dreadful
place
for
the
child
to
pass
the
long
days
and
nights
in
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
rather
hard
treatment
for
a
young
witness
,
is
it
not
?
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
What
says
our
conductor
?
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
an't
a
very
rowdy
life
,
and
THAT
'S
a
fact
!
"
   
<EOS>
Again
he
clinks
his
metal
castanet
,
and
leads
us
leisurely
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
question
to
ask
him
as
we
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
why
do
they
call
this
place
The
Tombs
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
's
the
ca
nt
name
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
Why
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Some
suicides
happened
here
,
when
it
was
first
built
.
 
<EOS>
I
expect
it
come
about
from
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
saw
just
now
,
that
that
man
's
clothes
were
scattered
about
the
floor
of
his
cell
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
oblige
the
prisoners
to
be
orderly
,
and
put
such
things
away
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
should
they
put
'
em
?
"
   
"
<EOS>
Not
on
the
ground
surely
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
to
hanging
them
up
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
stops
and
looks
round
to
emphasise
his
answer
:
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
say
that
's
just
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
had
hooks
they
WOULD
hang
themselves
,
so
they
're
taken
out
of
every
cell
,
and
there
's
only
the
marks
left
where
they
used
to
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
prison
-
yard
in
which
he
pauses
now
,
has
been
the
scene
of
terrible
performances
.
 
<EOS>
Into
this
narrow
,
grave
-
like
place
,
men
are
brought
out
to
die
.
 
<EOS>
The
wretched
creature
stands
beneath
the
gibbet
on
the
ground
;
the
rope
about
his
neck
;
and
when
the
sign
is
given
,
a
weight
at
its
other
end
comes
running
down
,
and
swings
him
up
into
the
air
---
a
corpse
.
   
<EOS>
The
law
requires
that
there
be
present
at
this
dismal
spectacle
,
the
judge
,
the
jury
,
and
citizens
to
the
amount
of
twenty
-
five
.
<EOS>
From
the
community
it
is
hidden
.
 
<EOS>
To
the
dissolute
and
bad
,
the
thing
remains
a
frightful
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
Between
the
criminal
and
them
,
the
prison
-
wall
is
interposed
as
a
thick
gloomy
veil
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
curtain
to
his
bed
of
death
,
his
winding
-
sheet
,
and
grave
.
 
<EOS>
From
him
it
shuts
out
life
,
and
all
the
motives
to
unrepenting
hardihood
in
that
last
hour
,
which
its
mere
sight
and
presence
is
often
all
-
sufficient
to
sustain
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
no
bold
eyes
to
make
him
bold
;
no
ruffians
to
uphold
a
ruffian
's
name
before
.
 
<EOS>
All
beyond
the
pitiless
stone
wall
,
is
unknown
space
.
   
<EOS>
Let
us
go
forth
again
into
the
cheerful
streets
.
   
<EOS>
Once
more
in
Broadway
!
 
<EOS>
Here
are
the
same
ladies
in
bright
colours
,
walking
to
and
fro
,
in
pairs
and
singly
;
yonder
the
very
same
light
blue
parasol
which
passed
and
repassed
the
hotel
-
window
twenty
times
while
we
were
sitting
there
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
going
to
cross
here
.
<EOS>
Take
care
of
the
pigs
.
 
<EOS>
Two
portly
sows
are
trotting
up
behind
this
carriage
,
and
a
select
party
of
half
-
a
-
dozen
gentlemen
hogs
have
just
now
turned
the
corner
.
   
<EOS>
Here
is
a
solitary
swine
lounging
homeward
by
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
only
one
ear
;
having
parted
with
the
other
to
vagrant
-
dogs
in
the
course
of
his
city
rambles
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
gets
on
very
well
without
it
;
and
leads
a
roving
,
gentlemanly
,
vagabond
kind
of
life
,
somewhat
answering
to
that
of
our
club
-
men
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
leaves
his
lodgings
every
morning
at
a
certain
hour
,
throws
himself
upon
the
town
,
gets
through
his
day
in
some
manner
quite
satisfactory
to
himself
,
and
regularly
appears
at
the
door
of
his
own
house
again
at
night
,
like
the
mysterious
master
of
Gil
Blas
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
free
-
and
-
easy
,
careless
,
indifferent
kind
of
pig
,
having
a
very
large
acquaintance
among
other
pigs
of
the
same
character
,
whom
he
rather
knows
by
sight
than
conversation
,
as
he
seldom
troubles
himself
to
stop
and
exchange
civilities
,
but
goes
grunting
down
the
kennel
,
turning
up
the
news
and
small
-
talk
of
the
city
in
the
shape
of
cabbage
-
stalks
and
offal
,
and
bearing
no
tails
but
his
own
:
 
which
is
a
very
short
one
,
for
his
old
enemies
,
the
dogs
,
have
been
at
that
too
,
and
have
left
him
hardly
enough
to
swear
by
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
in
every
respect
a
republican
pig
,
going
wherever
he
pleases
,
and
mingling
with
the
best
society
,
on
an
equal
,
if
not
superior
footing
,
for
every
one
makes
way
when
he
appears
,
and
the
haughtiest
give
him
the
wall
,
if
he
prefer
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
great
philosopher
,
and
seldom
moved
,
unless
by
the
dogs
before
mentioned
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
indeed
,
you
may
see
his
small
eye
twinkling
on
a
slaughtered
friend
,
whose
carcase
garnishes
a
butcher
's
door
-
post
,
but
he
grunts
out
"
<EOS>
Such
is
life
:
all
flesh
is
pork
!
"
buries
his
nose
in
the
mire
again
,
and
waddles
down
the
gutter
:
 
comforting
himself
with
the
reflection
that
there
is
one
snout
the
less
to
anticipate
stray
cabbage
-
stalks
,
at
any
rate
.
   
<EOS>
They
are
the
city
scavengers
,
these
pigs
.
 
<EOS>
Ugly
brutes
they
are
;
having
,
for
the
most
part
,
scanty
brown
backs
,
like
the
lids
of
old
horsehair
trunks
:
 
spotted
with
unwholesome
black
blotches
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
long
,
gaunt
legs
,
too
,
and
such
peaked
snouts
,
that
if
one
of
them
could
be
persuaded
to
sit
for
his
profile
,
nobody
would
recognise
it
for
a
pig
's
likeness
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
never
attended
upon
,
or
fed
,
or
driven
,
or
caught
,
but
are
thrown
upon
their
own
resources
in
early
life
,
and
become
preternaturally
knowing
in
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
Every
pig
knows
where
he
lives
,
much
better
than
anybody
could
tell
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
hour
,
just
as
evening
is
closing
in
,
you
will
see
them
roaming
towards
bed
by
scores
,
eating
their
way
to
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
Occasionally
,
some
youth
among
them
who
has
over
-
eaten
himself
,
or
has
been
worried
by
dogs
,
trots
shrinkingly
homeward
,
like
a
prodigal
son
:
 
<EOS>
but
this
is
a
rare
case
:
 
perfect
self
-
possession
and
self
-
reliance
,
and
immovable
composure
,
being
their
foremost
attributes
.
   
<EOS>
The
streets
and
shops
are
lighted
now
;
and
as
the
eye
travels
down
the
long
thoroughfare
,
dotted
with
bright
jets
of
gas
,
it
is
reminded
of
Oxford
Street
,
or
Piccadilly
.
 
<EOS>
Here
and
there
a
flight
of
broad
stone
cellar
-
steps
appears
,
and
a
painted
lamp
directs
you
to
the
Bowling
Saloon
,
or
Ten
-
Pin
alley
;
Ten
-
Pins
being
a
game
of
mingled
chance
and
skill
,
invented
when
the
legislature
passed
an
act
forbidding
Nine
-
Pins
.
 
<EOS>
At
other
downward
flights
of
steps
,
are
other
lamps
,
marking
the
whereabouts
of
oyster
-
cellars
---
pleasant
retreats
,
say
I
:
 
not
only
by
reason
of
their
wonderful
cookery
of
oysters
,
pretty
nigh
as
large
as
cheese
-
plates
(
or
for
thy
dear
sake
,
heartiest
of
Greek
Professors
!
)
,
but
because
of
all
kinds
of
caters
of
fish
,
or
flesh
,
or
fowl
,
in
these
latitudes
,
the
swallowers
of
oysters
alone
are
not
gregarious
;
but
subduing
themselves
,
as
it
were
,
to
the
nature
of
what
they
work
in
,
and
copying
the
coyness
of
the
thing
they
eat
,
do
sit
apart
in
curtained
boxes
,
and
consort
by
twos
,
not
by
two
hundreds
.
   
<EOS>
But
how
quiet
the
streets
are
!
 
<EOS>
Are
there
no
itinerant
bands
;
no
wind
or
stringed
instruments
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
not
one
.
 
<EOS>
By
day
,
are
there
no
Punches
,
Fantoccini
,
Dancing
-
dogs
,
Jugglers
,
Conjurers
,
Orchestrinas
,
or
even
Barrel
-
organs
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
not
one
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
remember
one
.
 
<EOS>
One
barrel
-
organ
and
a
dancing
-
monkey
---
sportive
by
nature
,
but
fast
fading
into
a
dull
,
lumpish
monkey
,
of
the
Utilitarian
school
.
 
<EOS>
Beyond
that
,
nothing
lively
;
no
,
not
so
much
as
a
white
mouse
in
a
twirling
cage
.
   
<EOS>
Are
there
no
amusements
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
lecture
-
room
across
the
way
,
from
which
that
glare
of
light
proceeds
,
and
there
may
be
evening
service
for
the
ladies
thrice
a
week
,
or
oftener
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
young
gentlemen
,
there
is
the
counting
-
house
,
the
store
,
the
bar
-
room
:
<EOS>
the
latter
,
as
you
may
see
through
these
windows
,
pretty
full
.
 
<EOS>
Hark
!
<EOS>
to
the
clinking
sound
of
hammers
breaking
lumps
of
ice
,
and
to
the
cool
gurgling
of
the
pounded
bits
,
as
,
in
the
process
of
mixing
,
they
are
poured
from
glass
to
glass
!
 
<EOS>
No
amusements
?
 
<EOS>
What
are
these
suckers
of
cigars
and
swallowers
of
strong
drinks
,
whose
hats
and
legs
we
see
in
every
possible
variety
of
twist
,
doing
,
but
amusing
themselves
?
 
<EOS>
What
are
the
fifty
newspapers
,
which
those
precocious
urchins
are
bawling
down
the
street
,
and
which
are
kept
filed
within
,
what
are
they
but
amusements
?
 
<EOS>
Not
vapid
,
waterish
amusements
,
but
good
strong
stuff
;
dealing
in
round
abuse
and
blackguard
names
;
pulling
off
the
roofs
of
private
houses
,
as
the
Halting
Devil
did
in
Spain
;
pimping
and
pandering
for
all
degrees
of
vicious
taste
,
and
gorging
with
coined
lies
the
most
voracious
maw
;
imputing
to
every
man
in
public
life
the
coarsest
and
the
vilest
motives
;
scaring
away
from
the
stabbed
and
prostrate
body
-
politic
,
every
Samaritan
of
clear
conscience
and
good
deeds
;
and
setting
on
,
with
yell
and
whistle
and
the
clapping
of
foul
hands
,
the
vilest
vermin
and
worst
birds
of
prey
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
No
amusements
!
   
<EOS>
Let
us
go
on
again
;
and
passing
this
wilderness
of
an
hotel
with
stores
about
its
base
,
like
some
Continental
theatre
,
or
the
London
Opera
House
shorn
of
its
colonnade
,
plunge
into
the
Five
Points
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
needful
,
first
,
that
we
take
as
our
escort
these
two
heads
of
the
police
,
whom
you
would
know
for
sharp
and
well
-
trained
officers
if
you
met
them
in
the
Great
Desert
.
 
<EOS>
So
true
it
is
,
that
certain
pursuits
,
wherever
carried
on
,
will
stamp
men
with
the
same
character
.
 
<EOS>
These
two
might
have
been
begotten
,
born
,
and
bred
,
in
Bow
Street
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
seen
no
beggars
in
the
streets
by
night
or
day
;
but
of
other
kinds
of
strollers
,
plenty
.
 
<EOS>
Poverty
,
wretchedness
,
and
vice
,
are
rife
enough
where
we
are
going
now
.
   
<EOS>
This
is
the
place
:
 
these
narrow
ways
,
diverging
to
the
right
and
left
,
and
reeking
everywhere
with
dirt
and
filth
.
 
<EOS>
Such
lives
as
are
led
here
,
bear
the
same
fruits
here
as
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
The
coarse
and
bloated
faces
at
the
doors
,
have
counterparts
at
home
,
and
all
the
wide
world
over
.
 
<EOS>
Debauchery
has
made
the
very
houses
prematurely
old
.
 
<EOS>
See
how
the
rotten
beams
are
tumbling
down
,
and
how
the
patched
and
broken
windows
seem
to
scowl
dimly
,
like
eyes
that
have
been
hurt
in
drunken
frays
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
those
pigs
live
here
.
 
<EOS>
Do
they
ever
wonder
why
their
masters
walk
upright
in
lieu
of
going
on
all
-
fours
?
<EOS>
and
why
they
talk
instead
of
grunting
?
   
<EOS>
So
far
,
nearly
every
house
is
a
low
tavern
;
and
on
the
bar
-
room
walls
,
are
coloured
prints
of
Washington
,
and
Queen
Victoria
of
England
,
and
the
American
Eagle
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
pigeon
-
holes
that
hold
the
bottles
,
are
pieces
of
plate
-
glass
and
coloured
paper
,
for
there
is
,
in
some
sort
,
a
taste
for
decoration
,
even
here
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
seamen
frequent
these
haunts
,
there
are
maritime
pictures
by
the
dozen
:
 
of
partings
between
sailors
and
their
lady
-
loves
,
portraits
of
William
,
of
the
ballad
,
and
his
Black
-
Eyed
Susan
;
of
Will
Watch
,
the
Bold
Smuggler
;
of
Paul
Jones
the
Pirate
,
and
the
like
:
 
on
which
the
painted
eyes
of
Queen
Victoria
,
and
of
Washington
to
boot
,
rest
in
as
strange
companionship
,
as
on
most
of
the
scenes
that
are
enacted
in
their
wondering
presence
.
   
<EOS>
What
place
is
this
,
to
which
the
squalid
street
conducts
us
?
 
<EOS>
A
kind
of
square
of
leprous
houses
,
some
of
which
are
attainable
only
by
crazy
wooden
stairs
without
.
 
<EOS>
What
lies
beyond
this
tottering
flight
of
steps
,
that
creak
beneath
our
tread
?
<EOS>
---
a
miserable
room
,
lighted
by
one
dim
candle
,
and
destitute
of
all
comfort
,
save
that
which
may
be
hidden
in
a
wretched
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Beside
it
,
sits
a
man
:
 
<EOS>
his
elbows
on
his
knees
:
 
his
forehead
hidden
in
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
ails
that
man
?
"
asks
the
foremost
officer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fever
,
"
he
sullenly
replies
,
without
looking
up
.
 
<EOS>
Conceive
the
fancies
of
a
feverish
brain
,
in
such
a
place
as
this
!
   
<EOS>
Ascend
these
pitch
-
dark
stairs
,
heedful
of
a
false
footing
on
the
trembling
boards
,
and
grope
your
way
with
me
into
this
wolfish
den
,
where
neither
ray
of
light
nor
breath
of
air
,
appears
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
A
negro
lad
,
startled
from
his
sleep
by
the
officer
's
voice
<EOS>
---
he
knows
it
well
---
but
comforted
by
his
assurance
that
he
has
not
come
on
business
,
officiously
bestirs
himself
to
light
a
candle
.
 
<EOS>
The
match
flickers
for
a
moment
,
and
shows
great
mounds
of
dusty
rags
upon
the
ground
;
then
dies
away
and
leaves
a
denser
darkness
than
before
,
if
there
can
be
degrees
in
such
extremes
.
 
<EOS>
He
stumbles
down
the
stairs
and
presently
comes
back
,
shading
a
flaring
taper
with
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
mounds
of
rags
are
seen
to
be
astir
,
and
rise
slowly
up
,
and
the
floor
is
covered
with
heaps
of
negro
women
,
waking
from
their
sleep
:
 
their
white
teeth
chattering
,
and
their
bright
eyes
glistening
and
winking
on
all
sides
with
surprise
and
fear
,
like
the
countless
repetition
of
one
astonished
African
face
in
some
strange
mirror
.
   
<EOS>
Mount
up
these
other
stairs
with
no
less
caution
<EOS>
(
there
are
traps
and
pitfalls
here
,
for
those
who
are
not
so
well
escorted
as
ourselves
)
into
the
housetop
;
where
the
bare
beams
and
rafters
meet
overhead
,
and
calm
night
looks
down
through
the
crevices
in
the
roof
.
 
<EOS>
Open
the
door
of
one
of
these
cramped
hutches
full
of
sleeping
negroes
.
 
<EOS>
Pah
!
 
<EOS>
They
have
a
charcoal
fire
within
;
there
is
a
smell
of
singeing
clothes
,
or
flesh
,
so
close
they
gather
round
the
brazier
;
and
vapours
issue
forth
that
blind
and
suffocate
.
<EOS>
From
every
corner
,
as
you
glance
about
you
in
these
dark
retreats
,
some
figure
crawls
half
-
awakened
,
as
if
the
judgment
-
hour
were
near
at
hand
,
and
every
obscene
grave
were
giving
up
its
dead
.
 
<EOS>
Where
dogs
would
howl
to
lie
,
women
,
and
men
,
and
boys
slink
off
to
sleep
,
forcing
the
dislodged
rats
to
move
away
in
quest
of
better
lodgings
.
   
<EOS>
Here
too
are
lanes
and
alleys
,
paved
with
mud
knee
-
deep
,
underground
chambers
,
where
they
dance
and
game
;
the
walls
bedecked
with
rough
designs
of
ships
,
and
forts
,
and
flags
,
and
American
eagles
out
of
number
:
 
ruined
houses
,
open
to
the
street
,
whence
,
<EOS>
through
wide
gaps
in
the
walls
,
other
ruins
loom
upon
the
eye
,
as
though
the
world
of
vice
and
misery
had
nothing
else
to
show
:
hideous
tenements
which
take
their
name
from
robbery
and
murder
:
all
that
is
loathsome
,
drooping
,
and
decayed
is
here
.
   
<EOS>
Our
leader
has
his
hand
upon
the
latch
of
"
Almack
's
,
"
and
calls
to
us
from
the
bottom
of
the
steps
;
for
the
assembly
-
room
of
the
Five
Point
fashionables
is
approached
by
a
descent
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
we
go
in
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
but
a
moment
.
   
<EOS>
Heyday
!
<EOS>
the
landlady
of
Almack
's
thrives
!
 
<EOS>
A
buxom
fat
mulatto
woman
,
with
sparkling
eyes
,
whose
head
is
daintily
ornamented
with
a
handkerchief
of
many
colours
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
is
the
landlord
much
behind
her
in
his
finery
,
being
attired
in
a
smart
blue
jacket
,
like
a
ship
's
steward
,
with
a
thick
gold
ring
upon
his
little
finger
,
and
round
his
neck
a
gleaming
golden
watch
-
guard
.
 
<EOS>
How
glad
he
is
to
see
us
!
 
<EOS>
What
will
we
please
to
call
for
?
 
<EOS>
A
dance
?
 
<EOS>
It
shall
be
done
directly
,
sir
:
 
"
a
regular
break
-
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
corpulent
black
fiddler
,
and
his
friend
who
plays
the
tambourine
,
stamp
upon
the
boarding
of
the
small
raised
orchestra
in
which
they
sit
,
and
play
a
lively
measure
.
 
<EOS>
Five
or
six
couple
come
upon
the
floor
,
marshalled
by
a
lively
young
negro
,
who
is
the
wit
of
the
assembly
,
and
the
greatest
dancer
known
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
leaves
off
making
queer
faces
,
and
is
the
delight
of
all
the
rest
,
who
grin
from
ear
to
ear
incessantly
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
dancers
are
two
young
mulatto
girls
,
with
large
,
black
,
drooping
eyes
,
and
head
-
gear
after
the
fashion
of
the
hostess
,
who
are
as
shy
,
or
feign
to
be
,
as
though
they
never
danced
before
,
and
so
look
down
before
the
visitors
,
that
their
partners
can
see
nothing
but
the
long
fringed
lashes
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
dance
commences
.
 
<EOS>
Every
gentleman
sets
as
long
as
he
likes
to
the
opposite
lady
,
and
the
opposite
lady
to
him
,
and
all
are
so
long
about
it
that
the
sport
begins
to
languish
,
when
suddenly
the
lively
hero
dashes
in
to
the
rescue
.
 
<EOS>
Instantly
the
fiddler
grins
,
and
goes
at
it
tooth
and
nail
<EOS>
;
there
is
new
energy
in
the
tambourine
;
new
laughter
in
the
dancers
;
new
smiles
in
the
landlady
;
new
confidence
in
the
landlord
;
new
brightness
in
the
very
candles
.
   
<EOS>
Single
shuffle
,
double
shuffle
,
cut
and
cross
-
cut
;
snapping
his
fingers
,
rolling
his
eyes
,
turning
in
his
knees
,
presenting
the
backs
of
his
legs
in
front
,
spinning
about
on
his
toes
and
heels
like
nothing
but
the
man
's
fingers
on
the
tambourine
;
dancing
with
two
left
legs
,
two
right
legs
,
two
wooden
legs
,
two
wire
legs
,
two
spring
legs
---
all
sorts
of
legs
and
no
legs
---
what
is
this
to
him
?
<EOS>
And
in
what
walk
of
life
,
or
dance
of
life
,
does
man
ever
get
such
stimulating
applause
as
thunders
about
him
,
when
,
having
danced
his
partner
off
her
feet
,
and
himself
too
,
he
finishes
by
leaping
gloriously
on
the
bar
-
counter
,
and
calling
for
something
to
drink
,
with
the
chuckle
of
a
million
of
counterfeit
Jim
Crows
,
in
one
inimitable
sound
!
   
<EOS>
The
air
,
even
in
these
distempered
parts
,
is
fresh
after
the
stifling
atmosphere
of
the
houses
;
and
now
,
as
we
emerge
into
a
broader
street
,
it
blows
upon
us
with
a
purer
breath
,
and
the
stars
look
bright
again
.
 
<EOS>
Here
are
The
Tombs
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
The
city
watch
-
house
is
a
part
of
the
building
.
 
<EOS>
It
follows
naturally
on
the
sights
we
have
just
left
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
see
that
,
and
then
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
do
you
thrust
your
common
offenders
against
the
police
discipline
of
the
town
,
into
such
holes
as
these
?
 
<EOS>
Do
men
and
women
,
against
whom
no
crime
is
proved
,
lie
here
all
night
in
perfect
darkness
,
surrounded
by
the
noisome
vapours
which
encircle
that
flagging
lamp
you
light
us
with
,
and
breathing
this
filthy
and
offensive
stench
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
such
indecent
and
disgusting
dungeons
as
these
cells
,
would
bring
disgrace
upon
the
most
despotic
empire
in
the
world
!
 
<EOS>
Look
at
them
,
man
---
you
,
who
see
them
every
night
,
and
keep
the
keys
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
see
what
they
are
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
how
drains
are
made
below
the
streets
,
and
wherein
these
human
sewers
differ
,
except
in
being
always
stagnant
?
   
<EOS>
Well
,
he
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
had
five
-
and
-
twenty
young
women
locked
up
in
this
very
cell
at
one
time
,
and
you
'd
hardly
realise
what
handsome
faces
there
were
among
'em
.
   
<EOS>
In
God
's
name
!
<EOS>
shut
the
door
upon
the
wretched
creature
who
is
in
it
now
,
and
put
its
screen
before
a
place
,
quite
unsurpassed
in
all
the
vice
,
neglect
,
and
devilry
,
of
the
worst
old
town
in
Europe
.
   
<EOS>
Are
people
really
left
all
night
,
untried
,
in
those
black
sties
?
---
Every
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
watch
is
set
at
seven
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
The
magistrate
opens
his
court
at
five
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
the
earliest
hour
at
which
the
first
prisoner
can
be
released
;
and
if
an
officer
appear
against
him
,
he
is
not
taken
out
till
nine
o'clock
or
ten
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
But
if
any
one
among
them
die
in
the
interval
,
as
one
man
did
,
not
long
ago
?
 
<EOS>
Then
he
is
half
-
eaten
by
the
rats
in
an
hour
's
time
;
as
that
man
was
;
and
there
an
end
.
   
<EOS>
What
is
this
intolerable
tolling
of
great
bells
,
and
crashing
of
wheels
,
and
shouting
in
the
distance
?
 
<EOS>
A
fire
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
that
deep
red
light
in
the
opposite
direction
?
 
<EOS>
Another
fire
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
these
charred
and
blackened
walls
<EOS>
we
stand
before
?
 
<EOS>
A
dwelling
where
a
fire
has
been
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
more
than
hinted
,
in
an
official
report
,
not
long
ago
,
that
some
of
these
conflagrations
were
not
wholly
accidental
,
and
that
speculation
and
enterprise
found
a
field
of
exertion
,
even
in
flames
:
 
but
be
this
as
it
may
,
there
was
a
fire
last
night
,
there
are
two
to
-
night
,
and
you
may
lay
an
even
wager
there
will
be
at
least
one
,
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
carrying
that
with
us
for
our
comfort
,
let
us
say
,
Good
night
,
and
climb
up
-
stairs
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
One
day
,
during
my
stay
in
New
York
,
I
paid
a
visit
to
the
different
public
institutions
on
Long
Island
,
or
Rhode
Island
:
 
<EOS>
I
forget
which
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
them
is
a
Lunatic
Asylum
.
 
<EOS>
The
building
is
handsome
;
and
is
remarkable
for
a
spacious
and
elegant
staircase
.
<EOS>
The
whole
structure
is
not
yet
finished
,
but
it
is
already
one
of
considerable
size
and
extent
,
and
is
capable
of
accommodating
a
very
large
number
of
patients
.
   
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
I
derived
much
comfort
from
the
inspection
of
this
charity
.
 
<EOS>
The
different
wards
might
have
been
cleaner
and
better
ordered
;
I
saw
nothing
of
that
salutary
system
which
had
impressed
me
so
favourably
elsewhere
;
and
everything
had
a
lounging
,
listless
,
madhouse
air
,
which
was
very
painful
.
 
<EOS>
The
moping
idiot
,
cowering
down
with
long
dishevelled
hair
;
the
gibbering
maniac
,
with
his
hideous
laugh
and
pointed
finger
;
the
vacant
eye
,
the
fierce
wild
face
,
the
gloomy
picking
of
the
hands
and
lips
,
and
munching
of
the
nails
:
 
there
they
were
all
,
without
disguise
,
in
naked
ugliness
and
horror
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
dining
-
room
,
a
bare
,
dull
,
dreary
place
,
with
nothing
for
the
eye
to
rest
on
but
the
empty
walls
,
a
woman
was
locked
up
alone
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
bent
,
they
told
me
,
on
committing
suicide
.
 
<EOS>
If
anything
could
have
strengthened
her
in
her
resolution
,
it
would
certainly
have
been
the
insupportable
monotony
of
such
an
existence
.
   
<EOS>
The
terrible
crowd
with
which
these
halls
and
galleries
were
filled
,
so
shocked
me
,
that
I
abridged
my
stay
within
the
shortest
limits
,
and
declined
to
see
that
portion
of
the
building
in
which
the
refractory
and
violent
were
under
closer
restraint
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
that
the
gentleman
who
presided
over
this
establishment
at
the
time
I
write
of
,
was
competent
to
manage
it
,
and
had
done
all
in
his
power
to
promote
its
usefulness
:
 
but
will
it
be
believed
that
the
miserable
strife
of
Party
feeling
is
carried
even
into
this
sad
refuge
of
afflicted
and
degraded
humanity
?
 
<EOS>
Will
it
be
believed
that
the
eyes
which
are
to
watch
over
and
control
the
wanderings
of
minds
on
which
the
most
dreadful
visitation
to
which
our
nature
is
exposed
has
fallen
,
must
wear
the
glasses
of
some
wretched
side
in
Politics
?
 
<EOS>
Will
it
be
believed
that
the
governor
of
such
a
house
as
this
,
is
appointed
,
and
deposed
,
and
changed
perpetually
,
as
Parties
fluctuate
and
vary
,
and
as
their
despicable
weathercocks
are
blown
this
way
or
that
?
 
<EOS>
A
hundred
times
in
every
week
,
some
new
most
paltry
exhibition
of
that
narrow
-
minded
and
injurious
Party
Spirit
,
which
is
the
Simoom
of
America
,
sickening
and
blighting
everything
of
wholesome
life
within
its
reach
,
was
forced
upon
my
notice
;
but
I
never
turned
my
back
upon
it
with
feelings
of
such
deep
disgust
and
measureless
contempt
,
as
when
I
crossed
the
threshold
of
this
madhouse
.
   
<EOS>
At
a
short
distance
from
this
building
is
another
called
the
Alms
House
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
workhouse
of
New
York
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
large
Institution
also
:
 
<EOS>
lodging
,
I
believe
,
when
I
was
there
,
nearly
a
thousand
poor
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
badly
ventilated
,
and
badly
lighted
;
was
not
too
clean
;
---
and
impressed
me
,
on
the
whole
,
very
uncomfortably
.
<EOS>
But
it
must
be
remembered
that
New
York
,
as
a
great
emporium
of
commerce
,
and
as
a
place
of
general
resort
,
not
only
from
all
parts
of
the
States
,
but
from
most
parts
of
the
world
,
has
always
a
large
pauper
population
to
provide
for
;
and
labours
,
therefore
,
under
peculiar
difficulties
in
this
respect
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
must
it
be
forgotten
that
New
York
is
a
large
town
,
and
that
in
all
large
towns
a
vast
amount
of
good
and
evil
is
intermixed
and
jumbled
up
together
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
same
neighbourhood
is
the
Farm
,
where
young
orphans
are
nursed
and
bred
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
see
it
,
but
I
believe
it
is
well
conducted
;
and
I
can
the
more
easily
credit
it
,
from
knowing
how
mindful
they
usually
are
,
in
America
,
of
that
beautiful
passage
in
the
Litany
which
remembers
all
sick
persons
and
young
children
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
taken
to
these
Institutions
by
water
,
in
a
boat
belonging
to
the
Island
jail
,
and
rowed
by
a
crew
of
prisoners
,
who
were
dressed
in
a
striped
uniform
of
black
and
buff
,
in
which
they
looked
like
faded
tigers
.
 
<EOS>
They
took
me
,
by
the
same
conveyance
,
to
the
jail
itself
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
an
old
prison
,
and
quite
a
pioneer
establishment
,
on
the
plan
I
have
already
described
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
glad
to
hear
this
,
for
it
is
unquestionably
a
very
indifferent
one
.
 
<EOS>
The
most
is
made
,
however
,
of
the
means
it
possesses
,
and
it
is
as
well
regulated
as
such
a
place
can
be
.
   
<EOS>
The
women
work
in
covered
sheds
,
erected
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
remember
right
,
there
are
no
shops
for
the
men
,
but
be
that
as
it
may
,
the
greater
part
of
them
labour
in
certain
stone
-
quarries
near
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
being
very
wet
indeed
,
this
labour
was
suspended
,
and
the
prisoners
were
in
their
cells
.
 
<EOS>
Imagine
these
cells
,
some
two
or
three
hundred
in
number
,
and
in
every
one
a
man
locked
up
;
this
one
at
his
door
for
air
,
with
his
hands
thrust
through
the
grate
;
this
one
in
bed
(
in
the
middle
of
the
day
,
remember
)
;
and
this
one
flung
down
in
a
heap
upon
the
ground
,
with
his
head
against
the
bars
,
like
a
wild
beast
.
 
<EOS>
Make
the
rain
pour
down
,
outside
,
in
torrents
.
 
<EOS>
Put
the
everlasting
stove
in
the
midst
;
hot
,
and
suffocating
,
and
vaporous
,
as
a
witch
's
cauldron
.
 
<EOS>
Add
a
collection
of
gentle
odours
,
such
as
would
arise
from
a
thousand
mildewed
umbrellas
,
wet
through
,
and
a
thousand
buck
-
baskets
,
full
of
half
-
washed
linen
---
and
there
is
the
prison
,
as
it
was
that
day
.
   
<EOS>
The
prison
for
the
State
at
Sing
Sing
is
,
on
the
other
hand
,
a
model
jail
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
and
Auburn
,
are
,
I
believe
,
the
largest
and
best
examples
of
the
silent
system
.
   
<EOS>
In
another
part
of
the
city
,
is
the
Refuge
for
the
Destitute
:
 
an
Institution
whose
object
is
to
reclaim
youthful
offenders
,
male
and
female
,
black
and
white
,
without
distinction
;
to
teach
them
useful
trades
,
apprentice
them
to
respectable
masters
,
and
make
them
worthy
members
of
society
.
 
<EOS>
Its
design
,
it
will
be
seen
,
is
similar
to
that
at
Boston
;
and
it
is
a
no
less
meritorious
and
admirable
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
A
suspicion
crossed
my
mind
during
my
inspection
of
this
noble
charity
,
whether
the
superintendent
had
quite
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
world
and
worldly
characters
;
and
whether
he
did
not
commit
a
great
mistake
in
treating
some
young
girls
,
who
were
to
all
intents
and
purposes
,
by
their
years
and
their
past
lives
,
women
,
as
though
they
were
little
children
;
which
certainly
had
a
ludicrous
effect
in
my
eyes
,
and
,
or
I
am
much
mistaken
,
in
theirs
also
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
Institution
,
however
,
is
always
under
a
vigilant
examination
of
a
body
of
gentlemen
of
great
intelligence
and
experience
,
it
can
not
fail
to
be
well
conducted
;
and
whether
I
am
right
or
wrong
in
this
slight
particular
,
is
unimportant
to
its
deserts
and
character
,
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
estimate
too
highly
.
   
<EOS>
In
addition
to
these
establishments
,
there
are
in
New
York
,
excellent
hospitals
and
schools
,
literary
institutions
and
libraries
;
an
admirable
fire
department
(
as
indeed
it
should
be
,
having
constant
practice
)
,
and
charities
of
every
sort
and
kind
.
<EOS>
In
the
suburbs
there
is
a
spacious
cemetery
:
 
unfinished
yet
,
but
every
day
improving
.
 
<EOS>
The
saddest
tomb
I
saw
there
was
"
The
Strangers
'
Grave
.
 
<EOS>
Dedicated
to
the
different
hotels
in
this
city
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
There
are
three
principal
theatres
.
 
<EOS>
Two
of
them
,
the
Park
and
the
Bowery
,
are
large
,
elegant
,
and
handsome
buildings
,
and
are
,
I
grieve
to
write
it
,
generally
deserted
.
 
<EOS>
The
third
,
the
Olympic
,
is
a
tiny
show
-
box
for
vaudevilles
and
burlesques
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
singularly
well
conducted
by
Mr
Mitchell
,
a
comic
actor
of
great
quiet
humour
and
originality
,
who
is
well
remembered
and
esteemed
by
London
playgoers
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
happy
to
report
of
this
deserving
gentleman
,
that
his
benches
are
usually
well
filled
,
and
that
his
theatre
rings
with
merriment
every
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
almost
forgotten
a
small
summer
theatre
,
called
Niblo
's
,
with
gardens
and
open
air
amusements
attached
;
but
I
believe
it
is
not
exempt
from
the
general
depression
under
which
Theatrical
Property
,
or
what
is
humorously
called
by
that
name
,
unfortunately
labours
.
   
<EOS>
The
country
round
New
York
is
surpassingly
and
exquisitely
picturesque
.
 
<EOS>
The
climate
,
as
I
have
already
intimated
,
is
somewhat
of
the
warmest
.
 
<EOS>
What
it
would
be
,
without
the
sea
breezes
which
come
from
its
beautiful
Bay
in
the
evening
time
,
I
will
not
throw
myself
or
my
readers
into
a
fever
by
inquiring
.
   
<EOS>
The
tone
of
the
best
society
in
this
city
,
is
like
that
of
Boston
;
here
and
there
,
it
may
be
,
with
a
greater
infusion
of
the
mercantile
spirit
,
but
generally
polished
and
refined
,
and
always
most
hospitable
.
 
<EOS>
The
houses
and
tables
are
elegant
;
the
hours
later
and
more
rakish
;
and
there
is
,
perhaps
,
a
greater
spirit
of
contention
in
reference
to
appearances
,
and
the
display
of
wealth
and
costly
living
.
 
<EOS>
The
ladies
are
singularly
beautiful
.
   
<EOS>
Before
I
left
New
York
I
made
arrangements
for
securing
a
passage
home
in
the
George
Washington
packet
ship
,
which
was
advertised
to
sail
in
June
:
 
<EOS>
that
being
the
month
in
which
I
had
determined
,
if
prevented
by
no
accident
in
the
course
of
my
ramblings
,
to
leave
America
.
   
<EOS>
I
never
thought
that
going
back
to
England
,
returning
to
all
who
are
dear
to
me
,
and
to
pursuits
that
have
insensibly
grown
to
be
a
part
of
my
nature
,
I
could
have
felt
so
much
sorrow
as
I
endured
,
when
I
parted
at
last
,
on
board
this
ship
,
with
the
friends
who
had
accompanied
me
from
this
city
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
thought
the
name
of
any
place
,
so
far
away
and
so
lately
known
,
could
ever
associate
itself
in
my
mind
with
the
crowd
of
affectionate
remembrances
that
now
cluster
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
those
in
this
city
who
would
brighten
,
to
me
,
the
darkest
winter
-
day
that
ever
glimmered
and
went
out
in
Lapland
;
and
before
whose
presence
even
Home
grew
dim
,
when
they
and
I
exchanged
that
painful
word
which
mingles
with
our
every
thought
and
deed
;
which
haunts
our
cradle
-
heads
in
infancy
,
and
closes
up
the
vista
of
our
lives
in
age

Chapter

<EOS>
Philadelphia
,
and
Its
Solitary
Prison
 
<EOS>
THE
journey
from
New
York
to
Philadelphia
,
is
made
by
railroad
,
and
two
ferries
;
and
usually
occupies
between
five
and
six
hours
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
evening
when
we
were
passengers
in
the
train
:
 
and
watching
the
bright
sunset
from
a
little
window
near
the
door
by
which
we
sat
,
my
attention
was
attracted
to
a
remarkable
appearance
issuing
from
the
windows
of
the
gentleman
's
car
immediately
in
front
of
us
,
which
I
supposed
for
some
time
was
occasioned
by
a
number
of
industrious
persons
inside
,
ripping
open
feather
-
beds
,
and
giving
the
feathers
to
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
it
occurred
to
me
that
they
were
only
spitting
,
which
was
indeed
the
case
;
though
how
any
number
of
passengers
which
it
was
possible
for
that
car
to
contain
,
could
have
maintained
such
a
playful
and
incessant
shower
of
expectoration
,
I
am
still
at
a
loss
to
understand
:
notwithstanding
the
experience
in
all
salivatory
phenomena
which
I
afterwards
acquired
.
   
<EOS>
I
made
acquaintance
,
on
this
journey
,
with
a
mild
and
modest
young
quaker
,
who
opened
the
discourse
by
informing
me
,
in
a
grave
whisper
,
that
his
grandfather
was
the
inventor
of
cold
-
drawn
castor
oil
.
 
<EOS>
I
mention
the
circumstance
here
,
thinking
it
probable
that
this
is
the
first
occasion
on
which
the
valuable
medicine
in
question
was
ever
used
as
a
conversational
aperient
.
   
<EOS>
We
reached
the
city
,
late
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
out
of
my
chamber
-
window
,
before
going
to
bed
,
I
saw
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
,
a
handsome
building
of
white
marble
,
which
had
a
mournful
ghost
-
like
aspect
,
dreary
to
behold
.
 
<EOS>
I
attributed
this
to
the
sombre
influence
of
the
night
,
and
on
rising
in
the
morning
looked
out
again
,
expecting
to
see
its
steps
and
portico
thronged
with
groups
of
people
passing
in
and
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
was
still
tight
shut
,
however
;
the
same
cold
cheerless
air
prevailed
:
 
and
the
building
looked
as
if
the
marble
statue
of
Don
Guzman
could
alone
have
any
business
to
transact
within
its
gloomy
walls
.
 
<EOS>
I
hastened
to
inquire
its
name
and
purpose
,
and
then
my
surprise
vanished
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
Tomb
of
many
fortunes
;
the
Great
Catacomb
of
investment
;
the
memorable
United
States
Bank
.
   
<EOS>
The
stoppage
of
this
bank
,
with
all
its
ruinous
consequences
,
had
cast
(
as
I
was
told
on
every
side
)
a
gloom
on
Philadelphia
,
under
the
depressing
effect
of
which
it
yet
laboured
.
 
<EOS>
It
certainly
did
seem
rather
dull
and
out
of
spirits
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
a
handsome
city
,
but
distractingly
regular
.
 
<EOS>
After
walking
about
it
for
an
hour
or
two
,
I
felt
that
I
would
have
given
the
world
for
a
crooked
street
.
 
<EOS>
The
collar
of
my
coat
appeared
to
stiffen
,
and
the
brim
of
my
bat
to
expand
,
beneath
its
quakery
influence
.
 
<EOS>
My
hair
shrunk
into
a
sleek
short
crop
,
my
hands
folded
themselves
upon
my
breast
of
their
own
calm
accord
,
and
thoughts
of
taking
lodgings
in
Mark
Lane
over
against
the
Market
Place
,
and
of
making
a
large
fortune
by
speculations
in
corn
,
came
over
me
involuntarily
.
   
<EOS>
Philadelphia
is
most
bountifully
provided
with
fresh
water
,
which
is
showered
and
jerked
about
,
and
turned
on
,
and
poured
off
,
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
The
Waterworks
,
which
are
on
a
height
near
the
city
,
are
no
less
ornamental
than
useful
,
being
tastefully
laid
out
as
a
public
garden
,
and
kept
in
the
best
and
neatest
order
.
 
<EOS>
The
river
is
dammed
at
this
point
,
and
forced
by
its
own
power
into
certain
high
tanks
or
reservoirs
,
whence
the
whole
city
,
to
the
top
stories
of
the
houses
,
is
supplied
at
a
very
trifling
expense
.
   
<EOS>
There
are
various
public
institutions
.
 
<EOS>
Among
them
a
most
excellent
Hospital
---
a
quaker
establishment
,
but
not
sectarian
in
the
great
benefits
it
confers
;
a
quiet
,
quaint
old
Library
,
named
after
Franklin
;
a
handsome
Exchange
and
Post
Office
;
and
so
forth
.
 
<EOS>
In
connection
with
the
quaker
Hospital
,
there
is
a
picture
by
West
,
which
is
exhibited
for
the
benefit
of
the
funds
of
the
institution
.
<EOS>
The
subject
is
,
our
Saviour
healing
the
sick
,
and
it
is
,
perhaps
,
as
favourable
a
specimen
of
the
master
as
can
be
seen
anywhere
.
<EOS>
Whether
this
be
high
or
low
praise
,
depends
upon
the
reader
's
taste
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
same
room
,
there
is
a
very
characteristic
and
life
-
like
portrait
by
Mr
Sully
,
a
distinguished
American
artist
.
   
<EOS>
My
stay
in
Philadelphia
was
very
short
,
but
what
I
saw
of
its
society
,
I
greatly
liked
.
 
<EOS>
Treating
of
its
general
characteristics
,
I
should
be
disposed
to
say
that
it
is
more
provincial
than
Boston
or
New
York
,
and
that
there
is
afloat
in
the
fair
city
,
an
assumption
of
taste
and
criticism
,
savouring
rather
of
those
genteel
discussions
upon
the
same
themes
,
in
connection
with
Shakspeare
and
the
Musical
Glasses
,
of
which
we
read
in
the
Vicar
of
Wakefield
.
 
<EOS>
Near
the
city
,
is
a
most
splendid
unfinished
marble
structure
for
the
Girard
College
,
founded
by
a
deceased
gentleman
of
that
name
and
of
enormous
wealth
,
which
,
if
completed
according
to
the
original
design
,
will
be
perhaps
the
richest
edifice
of
modern
times
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
bequest
is
involved
in
legal
disputes
,
and
pending
them
the
work
has
stopped
;
so
that
like
many
other
great
undertakings
in
America
,
even
this
is
rather
going
to
be
done
one
of
these
days
,
than
doing
now
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
outskirts
,
stands
a
great
prison
,
called
the
Eastern
Penitentiary
:
 
conducted
on
a
plan
peculiar
to
the
state
of
Pennsylvania
.
 
<EOS>
The
system
here
,
is
rigid
,
strict
,
and
hopeless
solitary
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
it
,
in
its
effects
,
to
be
cruel
and
wrong
.
   
<EOS>
In
its
intention
,
I
am
well
convinced
that
it
is
kind
,
humane
,
and
meant
for
reformation
;
but
I
am
persuaded
that
those
who
devised
this
system
of
Prison
Discipline
,
and
those
benevolent
gentlemen
who
carry
it
into
execution
,
do
not
know
what
it
is
that
they
are
doing
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
that
very
few
men
are
capable
of
estimating
the
immense
amount
of
torture
and
agony
which
this
dreadful
punishment
,
prolonged
for
years
,
inflicts
upon
the
sufferers
;
and
in
guessing
at
it
myself
,
and
in
reasoning
from
what
I
have
seen
written
upon
their
faces
,
and
what
to
my
certain
knowledge
they
feel
within
,
I
am
only
the
more
convinced
that
there
is
a
depth
of
terrible
endurance
in
it
which
none
but
the
sufferers
themselves
can
fathom
,
and
which
no
man
has
a
right
to
inflict
upon
his
fellow
-
creature
.
<EOS>
I
hold
this
slow
and
daily
tampering
with
the
mysteries
of
the
brain
,
to
be
immeasurably
worse
than
any
torture
of
the
body
:
 
and
because
its
ghastly
signs
and
tokens
are
not
so
palpable
to
the
eye
and
sense
of
touch
as
scars
upon
the
flesh
;
because
its
wounds
are
not
upon
the
surface
,
and
it
extorts
few
cries
that
human
ears
can
hear
;
therefore
I
the
more
denounce
it
,
as
a
secret
punishment
which
slumbering
humanity
is
not
roused
up
to
stay
.
 
<EOS>
I
hesitated
once
,
debating
with
myself
,
whether
,
if
I
had
the
power
of
saying
"
Yes
"
or
"
No
,
"
I
would
allow
it
to
be
tried
in
certain
cases
,
where
the
terms
of
imprisonment
were
short
;
but
now
,
I
solemnly
declare
,
that
with
no
rewards
or
honours
could
I
walk
a
happy
man
beneath
the
open
sky
by
day
,
or
lie
me
down
upon
my
bed
at
night
,
with
the
consciousness
that
one
human
creature
,
for
any
length
of
time
,
no
matter
what
,
lay
suffering
this
unknown
punishment
in
his
silent
cell
,
and
I
the
cause
,
or
I
consenting
to
it
in
the
least
degree
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
accompanied
to
this
prison
by
two
gentlemen
officially
connected
with
its
management
,
and
passed
the
day
in
going
from
cell
to
cell
,
and
talking
with
the
inmates
.
 
<EOS>
Every
facility
was
afforded
me
,
that
the
utmost
courtesy
could
suggest
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
was
concealed
or
hidden
from
my
view
,
and
every
piece
of
information
that
I
sought
,
was
openly
and
frankly
given
.
 
<EOS>
The
perfect
order
of
the
building
can
not
be
praised
too
highly
,
and
of
the
excellent
motives
of
all
who
are
immediately
concerned
in
the
administration
of
the
system
,
there
can
be
no
kind
of
question
.
   
<EOS>
Between
the
body
of
the
prison
and
the
outer
wall
,
there
is
a
spacious
garden
.
 
<EOS>
Entering
it
,
by
a
wicket
in
the
massive
gate
,
we
pursued
the
path
before
us
to
its
other
termination
,
and
passed
into
a
large
chamber
,
from
which
seven
long
passages
radiate
.
 
<EOS>
On
either
side
of
each
,
is
a
long
,
long
row
of
low
cell
doors
,
with
a
certain
number
over
every
one
.
 
<EOS>
Above
,
a
gallery
of
cells
like
those
below
,
except
that
they
have
no
narrow
yard
attached
(
as
those
in
the
ground
tier
have
)
,
and
are
somewhat
smaller
.
 
<EOS>
The
possession
of
two
of
these
,
is
supposed
to
compensate
for
the
absence
of
so
much
air
and
exercise
as
can
be
had
in
the
dull
strip
attached
to
each
of
the
others
,
in
an
hour
's
time
every
day
;
and
therefore
every
prisoner
in
this
upper
story
has
two
cells
,
adjoining
and
communicating
with
,
each
other
.
   
<EOS>
Standing
at
the
central
point
,
and
looking
down
these
dreary
passages
,
the
dull
repose
and
quiet
that
prevails
,
is
awful
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
,
there
is
a
drowsy
sound
from
some
lone
weaver
's
shuttle
,
or
shoemaker
's
last
,
but
it
is
stifled
by
the
thick
walls
and
heavy
dungeon
-
door
,
and
only
serves
to
make
the
general
stillness
more
profound
.
 
<EOS>
Over
the
head
and
face
of
every
prisoner
who
comes
into
this
melancholy
house
,
a
black
hood
is
drawn
;
and
in
this
dark
shroud
,
an
emblem
of
the
curtain
dropped
between
him
and
the
living
world
,
he
is
led
to
the
cell
from
which
he
never
again
comes
forth
,
until
his
whole
term
of
imprisonment
has
expired
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
hears
of
wife
and
children
;
home
or
friends
;
the
life
or
death
of
any
single
creature
.
 
<EOS>
He
sees
the
prison
-
officers
,
but
with
that
exception
he
never
looks
upon
a
human
countenance
,
or
hears
a
human
voice
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
man
buried
alive
;
to
be
dug
out
in
the
slow
round
of
years
;
and
in
the
mean
time
dead
to
everything
but
torturing
anxieties
and
horrible
despair
.
   
<EOS>
His
name
,
and
crime
,
and
term
of
suffering
,
are
unknown
,
even
to
the
officer
who
delivers
him
his
daily
food
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
number
over
his
cell
-
door
,
and
in
a
book
of
which
the
governor
of
the
prison
has
one
copy
,
and
the
moral
instructor
another
:
 
this
is
the
index
of
his
history
.
 
<EOS>
Beyond
these
pages
the
prison
has
no
record
of
his
existence
:
 
and
though
he
live
to
be
in
the
same
cell
ten
weary
years
,
he
has
no
means
of
knowing
,
down
to
the
very
last
hour
,
in
which
part
of
the
building
it
is
situated
;
what
kind
of
men
there
are
about
him
;
whether
in
the
long
winter
nights
there
are
living
people
near
,
or
he
is
in
some
lonely
corner
of
the
great
jail
,
with
walls
,
and
passages
,
and
iron
doors
between
him
and
the
nearest
sharer
in
its
solitary
horrors
.
   
<EOS>
Every
cell
has
double
doors
:
 
the
outer
one
of
sturdy
oak
,
the
other
of
grated
iron
,
wherein
there
is
a
trap
through
which
his
food
is
handed
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
Bible
,
and
a
slate
and
pencil
,
and
,
under
certain
restrictions
,
has
sometimes
other
books
,
provided
for
the
purpose
,
and
pen
and
ink
and
paper
.
 
<EOS>
His
razor
,
plate
,
and
can
,
and
basin
,
hang
upon
the
wall
,
or
shine
upon
the
little
shelf
.
 
<EOS>
Fresh
water
is
laid
on
in
every
cell
,
and
he
can
draw
it
at
his
pleasure
.
<EOS>
During
the
day
,
his
bedstead
turns
up
against
the
wall
,
and
leaves
more
space
for
him
to
work
in
.
 
<EOS>
His
loom
,
or
bench
,
or
wheel
,
is
there
;
and
there
he
labours
,
sleeps
and
wakes
,
and
counts
the
seasons
as
they
change
,
and
grows
old
.
   
<EOS>
The
first
man
I
saw
,
was
seated
at
his
loom
,
at
work
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
there
six
years
,
and
was
to
remain
,
I
think
,
three
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
convicted
as
a
receiver
of
stolen
goods
,
but
even
after
his
long
imprisonment
,
denied
his
guilt
,
and
said
he
had
been
hardly
dealt
by
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
his
second
offence
.
   
<EOS>
He
stopped
his
work
when
we
went
in
,
took
off
his
spectacles
,
and
answered
freely
to
everything
that
was
said
to
him
,
but
always
with
a
strange
kind
of
pause
first
,
and
in
a
low
,
thoughtful
voice
.
 
<EOS>
He
wore
a
paper
hat
of
his
own
making
,
and
was
pleased
to
have
it
noticed
and
commanded
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
very
ingeniously
manufactured
a
sort
of
Dutch
clock
from
some
disregarded
odds
and
ends
;
and
his
vinegar
-
bottle
served
for
the
pendulum
.
 
<EOS>
Seeing
me
interested
in
this
contrivance
,
he
looked
up
at
it
with
a
great
deal
of
pride
,
and
said
that
he
had
been
thinking
of
improving
it
,
and
that
he
hoped
the
hammer
and
a
little
piece
of
broken
glass
beside
it
"
would
play
music
before
long
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
had
extracted
some
colours
from
the
yarn
with
which
he
worked
,
and
painted
a
few
poor
figures
on
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
One
,
of
a
female
,
over
the
door
<EOS>
,
he
called
"
The
Lady
of
the
Lake
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
smiled
as
I
looked
at
these
contrivances
to
while
away
the
time
;
but
when
I
looked
from
them
to
him
,
I
saw
that
his
lip
trembled
,
and
could
have
counted
the
beating
of
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
forget
how
it
came
about
,
but
some
allusion
was
made
to
his
having
a
wife
.
 
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
at
the
word
,
turned
aside
,
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
resigned
now
!
"
said
one
of
the
gentlemen
after
a
short
pause
,
during
which
he
had
resumed
his
former
manner
.
 
<EOS>
He
answered
with
a
sigh
that
seemed
quite
reckless
in
its
hopelessness
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
<EOS>
oh
yes
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
resigned
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
are
a
better
man
,
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
hope
so
:
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
hope
I
may
be
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
time
goes
pretty
quickly
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Time
is
very
long
gentlemen
,
within
these
four
walls
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
gazed
about
him
---
<EOS>
Heaven
only
knows
how
wearily
!
<EOS>
---
as
he
said
these
words
;
and
in
the
act
of
doing
so
,
fell
into
a
strange
stare
as
if
he
had
forgotten
something
.
 
<EOS>
A
moment
afterwards
he
sighed
heavily
,
put
on
his
spectacles
,
and
went
about
his
work
again
.
   
<EOS>
In
another
cell
,
there
was
a
German
,
sentenced
to
five
years
'
imprisonment
for
larceny
,
two
of
which
had
just
expired
.
 
<EOS>
With
colours
procured
in
the
same
manner
,
he
had
painted
every
inch
of
the
walls
and
ceiling
quite
beautifully
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
laid
out
the
few
feet
of
ground
,
behind
,
with
exquisite
neatness
,
and
had
made
a
little
bed
in
the
centre
,
that
looked
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
like
a
grave
.
<EOS>
The
taste
and
ingenuity
he
had
displayed
in
everything
were
most
extraordinary
;
and
yet
a
more
dejected
,
heart
-
broken
,
wretched
creature
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
such
a
picture
of
forlorn
affliction
and
distress
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
bled
for
him
;
and
when
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
,
and
he
took
one
of
the
visitors
aside
,
to
ask
,
with
his
trembling
hands
nervously
clutching
at
his
coat
to
detain
him
,
whether
there
was
no
hope
of
his
dismal
sentence
being
commuted
,
the
spectacle
was
really
too
painful
to
witness
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
or
heard
of
any
kind
of
misery
that
impressed
me
more
than
the
wretchedness
of
this
man
.
   
<EOS>
In
a
third
cell
,
was
a
tall
,
strong
black
,
a
burglar
,
working
at
his
proper
trade
of
making
screws
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
His
time
was
nearly
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
only
a
very
dexterous
thief
,
but
was
notorious
for
his
boldness
and
hardihood
,
and
for
the
number
of
his
previous
convictions
.
 
<EOS>
He
entertained
us
with
a
long
account
of
his
achievements
,
which
he
narrated
with
such
infinite
relish
,
that
he
actually
seemed
to
lick
his
lips
as
he
told
us
racy
anecdotes
of
stolen
plate
,
and
of
old
ladies
whom
he
had
watched
as
they
sat
at
windows
in
silver
spectacles
(
he
had
plainly
had
an
eye
to
their
metal
even
from
the
other
side
of
the
street
)
and
had
afterwards
robbed
.
 
<EOS>
This
fellow
,
upon
the
slightest
encouragement
,
would
have
mingled
with
his
professional
recollections
the
most
detestable
ca
nt
;
but
I
am
very
much
mistaken
if
he
could
have
surpassed
the
unmitigated
hypocrisy
with
which
he
declared
that
he
blessed
the
day
on
which
he
came
into
that
prison
,
and
that
he
never
would
commit
another
robbery
as
long
as
he
lived
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
one
man
who
was
allowed
,
as
an
indulgence
,
to
keep
rabbits
.
 
<EOS>
His
room
having
rather
a
close
smell
in
consequence
<EOS>
,
they
called
to
him
at
the
door
to
come
out
into
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
He
complied
of
course
,
and
stood
shading
his
haggard
face
in
the
unwonted
sunlight
of
the
great
window
,
looking
as
wan
and
unearthly
as
if
he
had
been
summoned
from
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
white
rabbit
in
his
breast
;
and
when
the
little
creature
,
getting
down
upon
the
ground
,
stole
back
into
the
cell
,
and
he
,
being
dismissed
,
crept
timidly
after
it
<EOS>
,
I
thought
it
would
have
been
very
hard
to
say
in
what
respect
the
man
was
the
nobler
animal
of
the
two
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
an
English
thief
,
who
had
been
there
but
a
few
days
out
of
seven
years
:
 
a
villainous
,
low
-
browed
,
thin
-
lipped
fellow
,
with
a
white
face
;
who
had
as
yet
no
relish
for
visitors
,
and
who
,
but
for
the
additional
penalty
,
would
have
gladly
stabbed
me
with
his
shoemaker
's
knife
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
another
German
who
had
entered
the
jail
but
yesterday
,
and
who
started
from
his
bed
when
we
looked
in
,
and
pleaded
,
in
his
broken
English
,
very
hard
for
work
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
poet
,
who
after
doing
two
days
'
work
in
every
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
,
one
for
himself
and
one
for
the
prison
,
wrote
verses
about
ships
(
he
was
by
trade
a
mariner
)
,
and
"
the
maddening
wine
-
cup
,
"
and
his
friends
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
very
many
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
Some
reddened
at
the
sight
of
visitors
,
and
some
turned
very
pale
.
 
<EOS>
Some
two
or
three
had
prisoner
nurses
with
them
,
for
they
were
very
sick
;
and
one
,
a
fat
old
negro
whose
leg
had
been
taken
off
within
the
jail
,
had
for
his
attendant
a
classical
scholar
and
an
accomplished
surgeon
,
himself
a
prisoner
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
Sitting
upon
the
stairs
,
engaged
in
some
slight
work
,
was
a
pretty
coloured
boy
.
<EOS>
"
Is
there
no
refuge
for
young
criminals
in
Philadelphia
,
then
?
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
but
only
for
white
children
.
"
 
Noble
aristocracy
in
crime
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
sailor
who
had
been
there
upwards
of
eleven
years
,
and
who
in
a
few
months
'
time
would
be
free
.
 
<EOS>
Eleven
years
of
solitary
confinement
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
to
hear
your
time
is
nearly
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
What
does
he
say
?
 
<EOS>
Nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Why
does
he
stare
at
his
hands
,
and
pick
the
flesh
upon
his
fingers
,
and
raise
his
eyes
for
an
instant
,
every
now
and
then
,
to
those
bare
walls
which
have
seen
his
head
turn
grey
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
way
he
has
sometimes
.
   
<EOS>
Does
he
never
look
men
in
the
face
,
and
does
he
always
pluck
at
those
hands
of
his
,
as
though
he
were
bent
on
parting
skin
and
bone
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
his
humour
:
 
nothing
more
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
his
humour
too
,
to
say
that
he
does
not
look
forward
to
going
out
;
that
he
is
not
glad
the
time
is
drawing
near
;
that
he
did
look
forward
to
it
once
,
but
that
was
very
long
ago
;
that
he
has
lost
all
care
for
everything
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
his
humour
to
be
a
helpless
,
crushed
,
and
broken
man
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
Heaven
be
his
witness
that
he
has
his
humour
thoroughly
gratified
!
   
<EOS>
There
were
three
young
women
in
adjoining
cells
,
all
convicted
at
the
same
time
of
a
conspiracy
to
rob
their
prosecutor
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
silence
and
solitude
of
their
lives
they
had
grown
to
be
quite
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
Their
looks
were
very
sad
,
and
might
have
moved
the
sternest
visitor
to
tears
,
but
not
to
that
kind
of
sorrow
which
the
contemplation
of
the
men
awakens
.
 
<EOS>
One
was
a
young
girl
;
not
twenty
,
as
I
recollect
;
whose
snow
-
white
room
was
hung
with
the
work
of
some
former
prisoner
,
and
upon
whose
downcast
face
the
sun
in
all
its
splendour
shone
down
through
the
high
chink
in
the
wall
,
where
one
narrow
strip
of
bright
blue
sky
was
visible
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
very
penitent
and
quiet
;
had
come
to
be
resigned
,
she
said
(
and
I
believe
her
)
;
and
had
a
mind
at
peace
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
a
word
,
you
are
happy
here
?
"
said
one
of
my
companions
.
 
<EOS>
She
struggled
---
<EOS>
she
did
struggle
very
hard
---
to
answer
,
Yes
;
but
raising
her
eyes
,
and
meeting
that
glimpse
of
freedom
overhead
<EOS>
,
she
burst
into
tears
,
and
said
,
"
She
tried
to
be
;
she
uttered
no
complaint
;
but
it
was
natural
that
she
should
sometimes
long
to
go
out
of
that
one
cell
:
 
she
could
not
help
THAT
,
"
she
sobbed
,
poor
thing
!
   
<EOS>
I
went
from
cell
to
cell
that
day
;
and
every
face
I
saw
,
or
word
I
heard
,
or
incident
<EOS>
I
noted
,
is
present
to
my
mind
in
all
its
painfulness
.
 
<EOS>
But
let
me
pass
them
by
,
for
one
,
more
pleasant
,
glance
of
a
prison
on
the
same
plan
which
I
afterwards
saw
at
Pittsburg
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
had
gone
over
that
,
in
the
same
manner
,
I
asked
the
governor
if
he
had
any
person
in
his
charge
who
was
shortly
going
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
one
<EOS>
,
he
said
,
whose
time
was
up
next
day
;
but
he
had
only
been
a
prisoner
two
years
.
   
<EOS>
Two
years
!
 
<EOS>
I
looked
back
through
two
years
of
my
own
life
---
out
of
jail
,
prosperous
,
happy
,
<EOS>
surrounded
by
blessings
,
comforts
,
good
fortune
---
and
thought
how
wide
a
gap
it
was
,
and
how
long
those
two
years
passed
in
solitary
captivity
would
have
been
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
face
of
this
man
,
who
was
going
to
be
released
next
day
,
before
me
now
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
almost
more
memorable
in
its
happiness
than
the
other
faces
in
their
misery
.
 
<EOS>
How
easy
and
how
natural
it
was
for
him
to
say
that
the
system
was
a
good
one
;
and
that
the
time
went
"
pretty
quick
---
considering
;
"
and
that
when
a
man
once
felt
that
he
had
offended
the
law
,
and
must
satisfy
it
,
"
he
got
along
,
somehow
:
"
and
so
forth
!
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
call
you
back
to
say
to
you
,
in
that
strange
flutter
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
of
my
conductor
,
when
he
had
locked
the
door
and
joined
me
in
the
passage
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
That
he
was
afraid
the
soles
of
his
boots
were
not
fit
for
walking
,
as
they
were
a
good
deal
worn
when
he
came
in
;
and
that
he
would
thank
me
very
much
to
have
them
mended
,
ready
.
"
   
<EOS>
Those
boots
had
been
taken
off
his
feet
,
and
put
away
with
the
rest
of
his
clothes
,
two
years
before
!
   
<EOS>
I
took
that
opportunity
of
inquiring
how
they
conducted
themselves
immediately
before
going
out
;
adding
that
I
presumed
they
trembled
very
much
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
it
's
not
so
much
a
trembling
,
"
was
the
answer
---
"
though
they
do
quiver
---
as
a
complete
derangement
of
the
nervous
system
.
 
<EOS>
They
ca
n't
sign
their
names
to
the
book
;
sometimes
ca
n't
even
hold
the
pen
;
look
about
'em
without
appearing
to
know
why
,
or
where
they
are
;
and
sometimes
get
up
and
sit
down
again
,
twenty
times
in
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
when
they
're
in
the
office
,
where
they
are
taken
with
the
hood
on
,
as
they
were
brought
in
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
get
outside
the
gate
,
they
stop
,
and
look
first
one
way
<EOS>
and
then
the
other
;
not
knowing
which
to
take
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
they
stagger
as
if
they
were
drunk
,
and
sometimes
are
forced
to
lean
against
the
fence
<EOS>
,
they
're
so
bad
:
<EOS>
---
but
they
clear
off
in
course
of
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
I
walked
among
these
solitary
cells
,
and
looked
at
the
faces
of
the
men
within
them
,
I
tried
to
picture
to
myself
the
thoughts
and
feelings
natural
to
their
condition
.
 
<EOS>
I
imagined
the
hood
just
taken
off
,
and
the
scene
of
their
captivity
disclosed
to
them
in
all
its
dismal
monotony
.
   
<EOS>
At
first
,
the
man
is
stunned
.
 
<EOS>
His
confinement
is
a
hideous
vision
;
and
his
old
life
a
reality
.
 
<EOS>
He
throws
himself
upon
his
bed
,
and
lies
there
abandoned
to
despair
.
 
<EOS>
By
degrees
the
insupportable
solitude
and
barrenness
of
the
place
rouses
him
from
this
stupor
,
and
when
the
trap
in
his
grated
door
is
opened
,
he
humbly
begs
and
prays
for
work
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
me
some
work
to
do
,
or
I
shall
go
raving
mad
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
has
it
;
and
by
fits
and
starts
applies
himself
to
labour
;
but
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
there
comes
upon
him
a
burning
sense
of
the
years
that
must
be
wasted
in
that
stone
coffin
,
and
an
agony
so
piercing
in
the
recollection
of
those
who
are
hidden
from
his
view
and
knowledge
<EOS>
,
that
he
starts
from
his
seat
,
and
striding
up
and
down
the
narrow
room
with
both
hands
clasped
on
his
uplifted
head
,
hears
spirits
tempting
him
to
beat
his
brains
out
on
the
wall
.
   
<EOS>
Again
he
falls
upon
his
bed
,
and
lies
there
,
moaning
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
starts
up
,
wondering
whether
any
other
man
is
near
;
whether
there
is
another
cell
like
that
on
either
side
of
him
:
 
and
listens
keenly
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
no
sound
,
but
other
prisoners
may
be
near
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
He
remembers
to
have
heard
once
,
when
he
little
thought
of
coming
here
himself
,
that
the
cells
were
so
constructed
that
the
prisoners
could
not
hear
each
other
,
though
the
officers
could
hear
them
.
   
<EOS>
Where
is
the
nearest
man
---
upon
the
right
,
or
on
the
left
?
<EOS>
or
is
there
one
in
both
directions
?
 
<EOS>
Where
is
he
sitting
now
---
with
his
face
to
the
light
?
<EOS>
or
is
he
walking
to
and
fro
?
 
<EOS>
How
is
he
dressed
?
<EOS>
Has
he
been
here
long
?
 
<EOS>
Is
he
much
worn
away
?
 
<EOS>
Is
he
very
white
and
spectre
-
like
?
 
<EOS>
Does
HE
think
of
his
neighbour
too
?
   
<EOS>
Scarcely
venturing
to
breathe
,
and
listening
<EOS>
while
he
thinks
,
he
conjures
up
a
figure
with
his
back
towards
him
,
and
imagines
it
moving
about
in
this
next
cell
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
no
idea
of
the
face
,
but
he
is
certain
of
the
dark
form
of
a
stooping
man
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
cell
upon
the
other
side
,
he
puts
another
figure
,
whose
face
is
hidden
from
him
also
.
 
<EOS>
Day
after
day
,
and
often
when
he
wakes
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
he
thinks
of
these
two
men
until
he
is
almost
distracted
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
changes
them
.
 
<EOS>
There
they
are
always
as
he
first
imagined
them
---
an
old
man
on
the
right
;
a
younger
man
upon
the
left
---
whose
hidden
features
torture
him
to
death
,
and
have
a
mystery
that
makes
him
tremble
.
   
<EOS>
The
weary
days
pass
on
with
solemn
pace
,
like
mourners
at
a
funeral
;
and
slowly
he
begins
to
feel
that
the
white
walls
of
the
cell
have
something
dreadful
in
them
:
 
that
their
colour
is
horrible
:
 
that
their
smooth
surface
chills
his
blood
:
 
that
there
is
one
hateful
corner
which
torments
him
.
 
<EOS>
Every
morning
when
he
wakes
,
he
hides
his
head
beneath
the
coverlet
,
and
shudders
to
see
the
ghastly
ceiling
looking
down
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
blessed
light
of
day
itself
peeps
in
,
an
ugly
phantom
face
,
through
the
unchangeable
crevice
which
is
his
prison
window
.
   
<EOS>
By
slow
but
sure
degrees
,
the
terrors
of
that
hateful
corner
swell
until
they
beset
him
at
all
times
;
invade
his
rest
,
make
his
dreams
hideous
,
and
his
nights
dreadful
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
he
took
a
strange
dislike
to
it
;
feeling
as
though
it
gave
birth
in
his
brain
to
something
of
corresponding
shape
,
which
ought
not
to
be
there
,
and
racked
his
head
with
pains
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
began
to
fear
it
,
then
to
dream
of
it
,
and
of
men
whispering
its
name
and
pointing
to
it
.
<EOS>
Then
he
could
not
bear
to
look
at
it
,
nor
yet
to
turn
his
back
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
it
is
every
night
<EOS>
the
lurking
-
place
of
a
ghost
:
 
a
shadow
:
---
a
silent
something
,
horrible
to
see
,
but
whether
bird
,
or
beast
,
or
muffled
human
shape
,
he
can
not
tell
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
is
in
his
cell
by
day
,
he
fears
the
little
yard
without
.
<EOS>
When
he
is
in
the
yard
,
he
dreads
to
re
-
enter
the
cell
.
 
<EOS>
When
night
comes
,
there
stands
the
phantom
in
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
have
the
courage
to
stand
in
its
place
,
and
drive
it
out
<EOS>
(
he
had
once
:
being
desperate
)
<EOS>
,
it
broods
upon
his
bed
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
twilight
,
and
always
at
the
same
hour
,
a
voice
calls
to
him
by
name
;
as
the
darkness
thickens
,
his
Loom
begins
to
live
;
and
even
that
,
his
comfort
,
is
a
hideous
figure
,
watching
him
till
daybreak
.
   
<EOS>
Again
,
by
slow
degrees
,
these
horrible
fancies
depart
from
him
one
by
one
:
 
<EOS>
returning
sometimes
,
unexpectedly
,
but
at
longer
intervals
,
and
in
less
alarming
shapes
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
talked
upon
religious
matters
with
the
gentleman
who
visits
him
,
and
has
read
his
Bible
,
and
has
written
a
prayer
upon
his
slate
,
and
hung
it
up
as
a
kind
of
protection
,
and
an
assurance
of
Heavenly
companionship
.
 
<EOS>
He
dreams
now
,
sometimes
,
of
his
children
or
his
wife
,
but
is
sure
that
they
are
dead
,
or
have
deserted
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
easily
moved
to
tears
;
is
gentle
,
submissive
,
and
broken
-
spirited
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
,
the
old
agony
comes
back
:
 
<EOS>
a
very
little
thing
will
revive
it
;
even
a
familiar
sound
,
or
the
scent
of
summer
flowers
in
the
air
;
but
it
does
not
last
long
,
now
:
 
for
the
world
without
,
has
come
to
be
the
vision
,
and
this
solitary
life
,
the
sad
reality
.
   
<EOS>
If
his
term
of
imprisonment
be
short
---
I
mean
comparatively
,
for
short
it
can
not
be
---
<EOS>
the
last
half
year
is
almost
worse
than
all
;
for
then
he
thinks
the
prison
will
take
fire
and
he
be
burnt
in
the
ruins
,
or
that
he
is
doomed
to
die
within
the
walls
,
or
that
he
will
be
detained
on
some
false
charge
and
sentenced
for
another
term
:
 
or
that
something
,
no
matter
what
,
must
happen
to
prevent
his
going
at
large
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
is
natural
,
and
impossible
to
be
reasoned
against
,
because
,
after
his
long
separation
from
human
life
,
and
his
great
suffering
,
any
event
will
appear
to
him
more
probable
in
the
contemplation
,
than
the
being
restored
to
liberty
and
his
fellow
-
creatures
.
   
<EOS>
If
his
period
of
confinement
have
been
very
long
,
the
prospect
of
release
bewilders
and
confuses
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
broken
heart
may
flutter
for
a
moment
,
when
he
thinks
of
the
world
outside
,
and
what
it
might
have
been
to
him
in
all
those
lonely
years
,
but
that
is
all
.
<EOS>
The
cell
-
door
has
been
closed
too
long
on
all
its
hopes
and
cares
.
<EOS>
Better
to
have
hanged
him
in
the
beginning
than
bring
him
to
this
pass
,
and
send
him
forth
to
mingle
with
his
kind
,
who
are
his
kind
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
haggard
face
of
every
man
among
these
prisoners
,
the
same
expression
sat
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
liken
it
to
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
something
of
that
strained
attention
which
we
see
upon
the
faces
of
the
blind
and
deaf
,
mingled
with
a
kind
of
horror
,
as
though
they
had
all
been
secretly
terrified
.
 
<EOS>
In
every
little
chamber
that
I
entered
,
and
at
every
grate
through
which
I
looked
,
I
seemed
to
see
the
same
appalling
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
It
lives
in
my
memory
,
with
the
fascination
of
a
remarkable
picture
.
 
<EOS>
Parade
before
my
eyes
,
a
hundred
men
,
with
one
among
them
newly
released
from
this
solitary
suffering
,
and
I
would
point
him
out
.
   
<EOS>
The
faces
of
the
women
,
as
I
have
said
,
it
humanises
and
refines
.
<EOS>
Whether
this
be
because
of
their
better
nature
,
which
is
elicited
in
solitude
,
or
because
of
their
being
gentler
creatures
,
of
greater
patience
and
longer
suffering
,
I
do
not
know
;
but
so
it
is
.
<EOS>
That
the
punishment
is
nevertheless
,
to
my
thinking
,
fully
as
cruel
and
as
wrong
in
their
case
,
as
in
that
of
the
men
,
I
need
scarcely
add
.
   
<EOS>
My
firm
conviction
is
that
,
independent
of
the
mental
anguish
<EOS>
it
occasions
---
an
anguish
so
acute
and
so
tremendous
,
that
all
imagination
of
it
must
fall
far
short
of
the
reality
<EOS>
---
it
wears
the
mind
into
a
morbid
state
,
which
renders
it
unfit
for
the
rough
contact
and
busy
action
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
my
fixed
opinion
that
those
who
have
undergone
this
punishment
,
MUST
pass
into
society
again
morally
unhealthy
and
diseased
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
many
instances
on
record
,
of
men
who
have
chosen
,
or
have
been
condemned
,
to
lives
of
perfect
solitude
,
but
I
scarcely
remember
one
,
even
among
sages
of
strong
and
vigorous
intellect
,
where
its
effect
has
not
become
apparent
,
in
some
disordered
train
of
thought
,
or
some
gloomy
hallucination
.
 
<EOS>
What
monstrous
phantoms
,
bred
of
despondency
and
doubt
,
and
born
and
reared
in
solitude
,
have
stalked
upon
the
earth
,
making
creation
ugly
,
and
darkening
the
face
of
Heaven
!
   
<EOS>
Suicides
are
rare
among
these
prisoners
:
 
are
almost
,
indeed
,
unknown
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
argument
in
favour
of
the
system
,
can
reasonably
be
deduced
from
this
circumstance
,
although
it
is
very
often
urged
.
<EOS>
All
men
who
have
made
diseases
of
the
mind
their
study
,
know
perfectly
well
that
such
extreme
depression
and
despair
as
will
change
the
whole
character
,
and
beat
down
all
its
powers
of
elasticity
and
self
-
resistance
,
may
be
at
work
within
a
man
,
and
yet
stop
short
of
self
-
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
common
case
.
   
<EOS>
That
it
makes
the
senses
dull
,
and
by
degrees
impairs
the
bodily
faculties
,
I
am
quite
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
remarked
to
those
who
were
with
me
in
this
very
establishment
at
Philadelphia
,
that
the
criminals
who
had
been
there
long
,
were
deaf
.
 
<EOS>
They
,
who
were
in
the
habit
of
seeing
these
men
constantly
,
were
perfectly
amazed
at
the
idea
,
which
they
regarded
as
groundless
and
fanciful
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
the
very
first
prisoner
to
whom
they
appealed
---
one
of
their
own
selection
confirmed
my
impression
(
which
was
unknown
to
him
)
instantly
,
and
said
,
with
a
genuine
air
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
,
that
he
could
n't
think
how
it
happened
,
but
he
WAS
growing
very
dull
of
hearing
.
   
<EOS>
That
it
is
a
singularly
unequal
punishment
,
and
affects
the
worst
man
<EOS>
least
,
there
is
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
In
its
superior
efficiency
as
a
means
of
reformation
,
compared
with
that
other
code
of
regulations
which
allows
the
prisoners
to
work
in
company
without
communicating
together
,
I
have
not
the
smallest
faith
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
instances
of
reformation
that
were
mentioned
to
me
,
were
of
a
kind
that
might
have
been
---
and
I
have
no
doubt
whatever
,
in
my
own
mind
,
would
have
been
---
equally
well
brought
about
by
the
Silent
System
.
 
<EOS>
With
regard
to
such
men
as
the
negro
burglar
and
the
English
thief
,
even
the
most
enthusiastic
have
scarcely
any
hope
of
their
conversion
.
   
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
that
the
objection
that
nothing
wholesome
or
good
has
ever
had
its
growth
in
such
unnatural
solitude
,
and
that
even
a
dog
or
any
of
the
more
intelligent
among
beasts
,
would
pine
,
and
mope
,
and
rust
away
,
beneath
its
influence
,
would
be
in
itself
a
sufficient
argument
against
this
system
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
we
recollect
,
in
addition
,
how
very
cruel
and
severe
it
is
,
and
that
a
solitary
life
is
always
liable
to
peculiar
and
distinct
objections
of
a
most
deplorable
nature
,
which
have
arisen
here
,
and
call
to
mind
,
moreover
,
that
the
choice
is
not
between
this
system
,
and
a
bad
or
ill
-
considered
one
,
but
between
it
and
another
which
has
worked
well
,
and
is
,
in
its
whole
design
and
practice
,
excellent
;
there
is
surely
more
than
sufficient
reason
for
abandoning
a
mode
of
punishment
attended
by
so
little
hope
or
promise
,
and
fraught
,
beyond
dispute
,
with
such
a
host
of
evils
.
   
<EOS>
As
a
relief
to
its
contemplation
,
I
will
close
this
chapter
with
a
curious
story
arising
out
of
the
same
theme
,
which
was
related
to
me
,
on
the
occasion
of
this
visit
,
by
some
of
the
gentlemen
concerned
.
   
<EOS>
At
one
of
the
periodical
meetings
of
the
inspectors
of
this
prison
,
a
working
man
of
Philadelphia
presented
himself
before
the
Board
,
and
earnestly
requested
to
be
placed
in
solitary
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
On
being
asked
what
motive
could
possibly
prompt
him
to
make
this
strange
demand
,
he
answered
that
he
had
an
irresistible
propensity
to
get
drunk
;
that
he
was
constantly
indulging
it
,
to
his
great
misery
and
ruin
;
that
he
had
no
power
of
resistance
;
that
he
wished
to
be
put
beyond
the
reach
of
temptation
;
and
that
he
could
think
of
no
better
way
than
this
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
pointed
out
to
him
,
in
reply
,
that
the
prison
was
for
criminals
who
had
been
tried
and
sentenced
by
the
law
,
and
could
not
be
made
available
for
any
such
fanciful
purposes
;
he
was
exhorted
to
abstain
from
intoxicating
drinks
,
as
he
surely
might
if
he
would
;
and
received
other
very
good
advice
,
with
which
he
retired
,
exceedingly
dissatisfied
with
the
result
of
his
application
.
   
<EOS>
He
came
again
,
and
again
,
and
again
,
and
was
so
very
earnest
and
importunate
,
that
at
last
they
took
counsel
together
,
and
said
,
"
He
will
certainly
qualify
himself
for
admission
,
if
we
reject
him
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
shut
him
up
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
soon
be
glad
to
go
away
,
and
then
we
shall
get
rid
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
they
made
him
sign
a
statement
which
would
prevent
his
ever
sustaining
an
action
for
false
imprisonment
,
to
the
effect
that
his
incarceration
was
voluntary
,
and
of
his
own
seeking
;
they
requested
him
to
take
notice
that
the
officer
in
attendance
had
orders
to
release
him
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
,
when
he
might
knock
upon
his
door
for
that
purpose
;
but
desired
him
to
understand
,
that
once
going
out
,
he
would
not
be
admitted
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
These
conditions
agreed
upon
,
and
he
still
remaining
in
the
same
mind
,
he
was
conducted
to
the
prison
,
and
shut
up
in
one
of
the
cells
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
cell
,
the
man
,
who
had
not
the
firmness
to
leave
a
glass
of
liquor
standing
untasted
on
a
table
before
him
---
in
this
cell
,
in
solitary
confinement
,
and
working
every
day
at
his
trade
of
shoemaking
,
this
man
remained
nearly
two
years
.
 
<EOS>
His
health
beginning
to
fail
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
,
the
surgeon
recommended
that
he
should
work
occasionally
in
the
garden
;
and
as
he
liked
the
notion
very
much
,
he
went
about
this
new
occupation
with
great
cheerfulness
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
digging
here
,
one
summer
day
,
very
industriously
,
when
the
wicket
in
the
outer
gate
chanced
to
be
left
open
:
 
showing
,
beyond
,
the
well
-
remembered
dusty
road
and
sunburnt
fields
.
 
<EOS>
The
way
was
as
free
to
him
as
to
any
man
living
,
but
he
no
sooner
raised
his
head
and
caught
sight
of
it
,
all
shining
in
the
light
,
than
,
with
the
involuntary
instinct
of
a
prisoner
,
he
cast
away
his
spade
,
scampered
off
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
,
and
never
once
looked
back
.

Chapter

<EOS>
Washington
.
 
<EOS>
The
Legislature
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
President
's
House
 
WE
left
Philadelphia
by
steamboat
,
at
six
o'clock
one
very
cold
morning
,
and
turned
our
faces
towards
Washington
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
this
day
's
journey
,
as
on
subsequent
occasions
,
we
encountered
some
Englishmen
(
small
farmers
,
perhaps
,
or
country
publicans
at
home
)
who
were
settled
in
America
,
and
were
travelling
on
their
own
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
Of
all
grades
and
kinds
of
men
that
jostle
one
in
the
public
conveyances
of
the
States
,
these
are
often
the
most
intolerable
and
the
most
insufferable
companions
.
 
<EOS>
United
to
every
disagreeable
characteristic
that
the
worst
kind
of
American
travellers
possess
,
these
countrymen
of
ours
display
an
amount
of
insolent
conceit
and
cool
assumption
of
superiority
,
quite
monstrous
to
behold
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
coarse
familiarity
of
their
approach
,
and
the
effrontery
of
their
inquisitiveness
(
which
they
are
in
great
haste
to
assert
,
as
if
they
panted
to
revenge
themselves
upon
the
decent
old
restraints
of
home
)
,
they
surpass
any
native
specimens
that
came
within
my
range
of
observation
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
often
grew
so
patriotic
when
I
saw
and
heard
them
,
that
I
would
cheerfully
have
submitted
to
a
reasonable
fine
,
if
I
could
have
given
any
other
country
in
the
whole
world
,
the
honour
of
claiming
them
for
its
children
.
   
<EOS>
As
Washington
may
be
called
the
head
-
quarters
of
tobacco
-
tinctured
saliva
,
the
time
is
come
when
I
must
confess
,
without
any
disguise
,
that
the
prevalence
of
those
two
odious
practices
of
chewing
and
expectorating
began
about
this
time
to
be
anything
but
agreeable
,
and
soon
became
most
offensive
and
sickening
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
the
public
places
of
America
,
this
filthy
custom
is
recognised
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
courts
of
law
,
the
judge
has
his
spittoon
,
the
crier
his
,
the
witness
his
,
and
the
prisoner
his
;
while
the
jurymen
and
spectators
are
provided
for
,
as
so
many
men
who
in
the
course
of
nature
must
desire
to
spit
incessantly
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
hospitals
,
the
students
of
medicine
are
requested
,
by
notices
upon
the
wall
,
to
eject
their
tobacco
juice
into
the
boxes
provided
for
that
purpose
,
and
not
to
discolour
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
In
public
buildings
,
visitors
are
implored
,
through
the
same
agency
,
to
squirt
the
essence
of
their
quids
,
or
"
plugs
,
"
as
I
have
heard
them
called
by
gentlemen
learned
in
this
kind
of
sweetmeat
,
into
the
national
spittoons
,
and
not
about
the
bases
of
the
marble
columns
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
some
parts
,
this
custom
is
inseparably
mixed
up
with
every
meal
and
morning
call
,
and
with
all
the
transactions
of
social
life
.
 
<EOS>
The
stranger
,
who
follows
in
the
track
I
took
myself
,
will
find
it
in
its
full
bloom
and
glory
,
luxuriant
in
all
its
alarming
recklessness
,
at
Washington
.
 
<EOS>
And
let
him
not
persuade
himself
(
as
I
once
did
,
to
my
shame
)
that
previous
tourists
have
exaggerated
its
extent
.
 
<EOS>
The
thing
itself
is
an
exaggeration
of
nastiness
,
which
can
not
be
outdone
.
   
<EOS>
On
board
<EOS>
this
steamboat
,
there
were
two
young
gentlemen
,
with
shirt
-
collars
reversed
as
usual
,
and
armed
with
very
big
walking
-
sticks
;
who
planted
two
seats
in
the
middle
of
the
deck
,
at
a
distance
of
some
four
paces
apart
;
took
out
their
tobacco
-
boxes
;
and
sat
down
opposite
each
other
,
to
chew
.
 
<EOS>
In
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
time
,
these
hopeful
youths
had
shed
about
them
on
the
clean
boards
,
a
copious
shower
of
yellow
rain
;
clearing
,
by
that
means
,
a
kind
of
magic
circle
,
within
whose
limits
no
intruders
dared
to
come
,
and
which
they
never
failed
to
refresh
and
re
-
refresh
before
a
spot
was
dry
.
 
<EOS>
This
being
before
breakfast
,
rather
disposed
me
,
I
confess
,
to
nausea
;
but
looking
attentively
at
one
of
the
expectorators
,
I
plainly
saw
that
he
was
young
in
chewing
,
and
felt
inwardly
uneasy
,
himself
.
 
<EOS>
A
glow
of
delight
came
over
me
at
this
discovery
;
and
as
I
marked
his
face
turn
paler
and
paler
,
and
saw
the
ball
of
tobacco
in
his
left
cheek
,
quiver
with
his
suppressed
agony
,
while
yet
he
spat
,
and
chewed
,
and
spat
again
,
in
emulation
of
his
older
friend
,
I
could
have
fallen
on
his
neck
and
implored
him
to
go
on
for
hours
.
   
<EOS>
We
all
sat
down
to
a
comfortable
breakfast
in
the
cabin
below
,
where
there
was
no
more
hurry
or
confusion
than
at
such
a
meal
in
England
,
and
where
there
was
certainly
greater
politeness
exhibited
than
at
most
of
our
stage
-
coach
banquets
.
 
<EOS>
At
about
nine
o'clock
we
arrived
at
the
railroad
station
,
and
went
on
by
the
cars
.
 
<EOS>
At
noon
we
turned
out
again
,
to
cross
a
wide
river
in
another
steamboat
;
landed
at
a
continuation
of
the
railroad
on
the
opposite
shore
;
and
went
on
by
other
cars
;
in
which
,
in
the
course
of
the
next
hour
or
so
,
we
crossed
by
wooden
bridges
,
each
a
mile
in
length
,
two
creeks
,
called
respectively
Great
and
Little
Gunpowder
.
 
<EOS>
The
water
in
both
was
blackened
with
flights
of
canvas
-
backed
ducks
,
which
are
most
delicious
eating
,
and
abound
hereabouts
at
that
season
of
the
year
.
   
<EOS>
These
bridges
are
of
wood
,
have
no
parapet
,
and
are
only
just
wide
enough
for
the
passage
of
the
trains
;
which
,
in
the
event
of
the
smallest
accident
,
wound
inevitably
be
plunged
into
the
river
.
<EOS>
They
are
startling
contrivances
,
and
are
most
agreeable
when
passed
.
   
<EOS>
We
stopped
to
dine
at
Baltimore
,
and
being
now
in
Maryland
,
were
waited
on
,
for
the
first
time
,
by
slaves
.
 
<EOS>
The
sensation
of
exacting
any
service
from
human
creatures
who
are
bought
and
sold
,
and
being
,
for
the
time
,
a
party
as
it
were
to
their
condition
,
is
not
an
enviable
one
.
 
<EOS>
The
institution
exists
,
perhaps
,
in
its
least
repulsive
and
most
mitigated
form
in
such
a
town
as
this
;
but
it
IS
slavery
;
and
though
I
was
,
with
respect
to
it
,
an
innocent
man
,
its
presence
filled
me
with
a
sense
of
shame
and
self
-
reproach
.
   
<EOS>
After
dinner
,
we
went
down
to
the
railroad
again
,
and
took
our
seats
in
the
cars
for
Washington
.
 
<EOS>
Being
rather
early
,
those
men
and
boys
who
happened
to
have
nothing
particular
to
do
,
and
were
curious
in
foreigners
,
came
(
according
to
custom
)
<EOS>
round
the
carriage
in
which
I
sat
;
let
down
all
the
windows
;
thrust
in
their
heads
and
shoulders
;
hooked
themselves
on
conveniently
,
by
their
elbows
;
and
fell
to
comparing
notes
on
the
subject
of
my
personal
appearance
,
with
as
much
indifference
as
if
I
were
a
stuffed
figure
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
gained
so
much
uncompromising
information
with
reference
to
my
own
nose
and
eyes
,
and
various
impressions
wrought
by
my
mouth
and
chin
on
different
minds
,
and
how
my
head
looks
when
it
is
viewed
from
behind
,
as
on
these
occasions
.
 
<EOS>
Some
gentlemen
were
only
satisfied
by
exercising
their
sense
of
touch
;
and
the
boys
(
who

Many
a
budding
president
has
walked
into
my
room
with
his
cap
on
his
head
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
stared
at
me
for
two
whole
hours
:
 
occasionally
refreshing
himself
with
a
tweak
of
his
nose
,
or
a
draught
from
the
water
-
jug
;
or
by
walking
to
the
windows
and
inviting
other
boys
in
the
street
below
,
to
come
up
and
do
likewise
:
 
crying
,
"
Here
he
is
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
on
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bring
all
your
brothers
!
"
<EOS>
with
other
hospitable
entreaties
of
that
nature

We
reached
Washington
at
about
half
-
past
six
that
evening
,
and
had
upon
the
way
a
beautiful
view
of
the
Capitol
,
which
is
a
fine
building
of
the
Corinthian
order
,
placed
upon
a
noble
and
commanding
eminence
.
 
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
hotel
;
I
saw
no
more
of
the
place
that
night
;
being
very
tired
,
and
glad
to
get
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
Breakfast
over
next
morning
,
I
walk
about
the
streets
for
an
hour
or
two
,
and
,
coming
home
,
throw
up
the
window
in
the
front
and
back
,
and
look
out
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
Washington
,
fresh
in
my
mind
and
under
my
eye
.
   
<EOS>
Take
the
worst
parts
of
the
City
Road
and
Pentonville
,
or
the
straggling
outskirts
of
Paris
,
where
the
houses
are
smallest
,
preserving
all
their
oddities
,
but
especially
the
small
shops
and
dwellings
,
occupied
in
Pentonville
(
but
not
in
Washington
)
by
furniture
-
brokers
,
keepers
of
poor
eating
-
houses
,
and
fanciers
of
birds
.
 
<EOS>
Burn
the
whole
down
;
build
it
up
again
in
wood
and
plaster
;
widen
it
a
little
;
throw
in
part
of
St
John
's
Wood
;
put
green
blinds
outside
all
the
private
houses
,
with
a
red
curtain
and
a
white
one
in
every
window
;
plough
up
all
the
roads
;
plant
a
great
deal
of
coarse
turf
in
every
place
where
it
ought
NOT
to
be
;
erect
three
handsome
buildings
in
stone
and
marble
,
anywhere
,
but
the
more
entirely
out
of
everybody
's
way
the
better
;
call
one
the
Post
Office
;
one
the
Patent
Office
,
and
one
the
Treasury
;
make
it
scorching
hot
in
the
morning
,
and
freezing
cold
in
the
afternoon
,
with
an
occasional
tornado
of
wind
and
dust
;
leave
a
brick
-
field
without
the
bricks
,
in
all
central
places
where
a
street
may
naturally
be
expected
:
 
and
that
's
Washington
.
   
<EOS>
The
hotel
in
which
we
live
,
is
a
long
row
of
small
houses
fronting
on
the
street
,
and
opening
at
the
back
upon
a
common
yard
,
in
which
hangs
a
great
triangle
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
a
servant
is
wanted
,
somebody
beats
on
this
triangle
from
one
stroke
up
to
seven
,
according
to
the
number
of
the
house
in
which
his
presence
is
required
;
and
as
all
the
servants
are
always
being
wanted
,
and
none
of
them
ever
come
,
this
enlivening
engine
is
in
full
performance
the
whole
day
through
.
 
<EOS>
Clothes
are
drying
in
the
same
yard
;
female
slaves
,
with
cotton
handkerchiefs
twisted
round
their
heads
are
running
to
and
fro
on
the
hotel
business
;
black
waiters
cross
and
recross
with
dishes
in
their
hands
;
two
great
dogs
are
playing
upon
a
mound
of
loose
bricks
in
the
centre
of
the
little
square
;
a
pig
is
turning
up
his
stomach
to
the
sun
,
and
grunting
"
that
's
comfortable
!
"
<EOS>
;
and
neither
the
men
,
nor
the
women
,
nor
the
dogs
,
nor
the
pig
,
nor
any
created
creature
,
takes
the
smallest
notice
of
the
triangle
,
which
is
tingling
madly
all
the
time
.
   
<EOS>
I
walk
to
the
front
window
,
and
look
across
the
road
upon
a
long
,
straggling
row
of
houses
,
one
story
high
,
terminating
,
nearly
opposite
,
but
a
little
to
the
left
,
in
a
melancholy
piece
of
waste
ground
with
frowzy
grass
,
which
looks
like
a
small
piece
of
country
that
has
taken
to
drinking
,
and
has
quite
lost
itself
.
 
<EOS>
Standing
anyhow
and
all
wrong
,
upon
this
open
space
,
like
something
meteoric
that
has
fallen
down
from
the
moon
,
is
an
odd
,
lop
-
sided
,
one
-
eyed
kind
of
wooden
building
,
that
looks
like
a
church
,
with
a
flag
-
staff
as
long
as
itself
sticking
out
of
a
steeple
<EOS>
something
larger
than
a
tea
-
chest
.
 
<EOS>
Under
the
window
is
a
small
stand
of
coaches
,
whose
slave
-
drivers
are
sunning
themselves
on
the
steps
of
our
door
,
and
talking
idly
together
.
 
<EOS>
The
three
most
obtrusive
houses
near
at
hand
are
the
three
meanest
.
 
<EOS>
On
one
---
a
shop
,
which
never
has
anything
in
the
window
,
and
never
has
the
door
open
---
is
painted
in
large
characters
,
"
THE
CITY
LUNCH
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
another
,
which
looks
like
a
backway
to
somewhere
else
,
but
is
an
independent
building
in
itself
,
oysters
are
procurable
in
every
style
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
third
,
which
is
a
very
,
very
little
tailor
's
shop
,
pants
are
fixed
to
order
;
or
in
other
words
,
pantaloons
are
made
to
measure
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
is
our
street
in
Washington
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
sometimes
called
the
City
of
Magnificent
Distances
,
but
it
might
with
greater
propriety
be
termed
the
City
of
Magnificent
Intentions
;
for
it
is
only
on
taking
a
bird's
-
eye
view
of
it
from
the
top
of
the
Capitol
,
that
one
can
at
all
comprehend
the
vast
designs
of
its
projector
,
an
aspiring
Frenchman
.
 
<EOS>
Spacious
avenues
,
that
begin
in
nothing
,
and
lead
nowhere
;
streets
,
mile
-
long
,
that
only
want
houses
,
roads
and
inhabitants
;
public
buildings
that
need
but
a
public
to
be
complete
;
and
ornaments
of
great
thoroughfares
,
which
only
lack
great
thoroughfares
to
ornament
---
are
its
leading
features
.
 
<EOS>
One
might
fancy
the
season
over
,
and
most
of
the
houses
gone
out
of
town
for
ever
with
their
masters
.
 
<EOS>
To
the
admirers
of
cities
it
is
a
Barmecide
Feast
:
 
a
pleasant
field
for
the
imagination
to
rove
in
;
a
monument
raised
to
a
deceased
project
,
with
not
even
a
legible
inscription
to
record
its
departed
greatness
.
   
<EOS>
Such
as
it
is
,
it
is
likely
to
remain
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
originally
chosen
for
the
seat
of
Government
,
as
a
means
of
averting
the
conflicting
jealousies
and
interests
of
the
different
States
;
and
very
probably
,
too
,
as
being
remote
from
mobs
:
 
<EOS>
a
consideration
not
to
be
slighted
,
even
in
America
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
no
trade
or
commerce
of
its
own
:
 
<EOS>
having
little
or
no
population
beyond
the
President
and
his
establishment
;
the
members
of
the
legislature
who
reside
there
during
the
session
;
the
Government
clerks
and
officers
employed
in
the
various
departments
;
the
keepers
of
the
hotels
and
boarding
-
houses
;
and
the
tradesmen
who
supply
their
tables
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
unhealthy
.
 
<EOS>
Few
people
would
live
in
Washington
<EOS>
,
I
take
it
,
who
were
not
obliged
to
reside
there
;
and
the
tides
of
emigration
and
speculation
,
those
rapid
and
regardless
currents
,
are
little
likely
to
flow
at
any
time
towards
such
dull
and
sluggish
water
.
   
<EOS>
The
principal
features
of
the
Capitol
,
are
,
of
course
,
the
two
houses
of
Assembly
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
is
,
besides
,
in
the
centre
of
the
building
,
a
fine
rotunda
,
ninety
-
six
feet
in
diameter
,
and
ninety
-
six
high
,
whose
circular
wall
is
divided
into
compartments
,
ornamented
by
historical
pictures
.
 
<EOS>
Four
of
these
have
for
their
subjects
prominent
events
in
the
revolutionary
struggle
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
painted
by
Colonel
Trumbull
,
himself
a
member
of
Washington
's
staff
at
the
time
of
their
occurrence
;
from
which
circumstance
they
derive
a
peculiar
interest
of
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
same
hall
Mr
Greenough
's
large
statue
of
Washington
has
been
lately
placed
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
great
merits
of
course
,
but
it
struck
me
as
being
rather
strained
and
violent
for
its
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
wish
,
however
,
to
have
seen
it
in
a
better
light
than
it
can
ever
be
viewed
in
,
where
it
stands
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
a
very
pleasant
and
commodious
library
in
the
Capitol
;
and
from
a
balcony
in
front
,
the
bird's
-
eye
view
,
of
which
I
have
just
spoken
,
may
be
had
,
together
with
a
beautiful
prospect
of
the
adjacent
country
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
of
the
ornamented
portions
of
the
building
,
there
is
a
figure
of
Justice
;
whereunto
the
Guide
Book
says
,
"
the
artist
at
first
contemplated
giving
more
of
nudity
,
but
he
was
warned
that
the
public
sentiment
in
this
country
would
not
admit
of
it
,
and
in
his
caution
he
has
gone
,
perhaps
,
into
the
opposite
extreme
.
"
 
<EOS>
Poor
Justice
!
<EOS>
she
has
been
made
to
wear
much
stranger
garments
in
America
than
those
she
pines
in
,
in
the
Capitol
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
hope
that
she
has
changed
her
dress
-
maker
since
they
were
fashioned
,
and
that
the
public
sentiment
of
the
country
did
not
cut
out
the
clothes
she
hides
her
lovely
figure
in
,
just
now
.
   
<EOS>
The
House
of
Representatives
is
a
beautiful
and
spacious
hall
,
of
semicircular
shape
,
supported
by
handsome
pillars
.
 
<EOS>
One
part
of
the
gallery
is
appropriated
to
the
ladies
,
and
there
they
sit
in
front
rows
,
and
come
in
,
and
go
out
,
as
at
a
play
or
concert
.
 
<EOS>
The
chair
is
canopied
,
and
raised
considerably
above
the
floor
of
the
House
;
and
every
member
has
an
easy
chair
and
a
writing
desk
to
himself
:
which
is
denounced
by
some
people
out
of
doors
as
a
most
unfortunate
and
injudicious
arrangement
,
tending
to
long
sittings
and
prosaic
speeches
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
an
elegant
chamber
to
look
at
,
but
a
singularly
bad
one
for
all
purposes
of
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
The
Senate
,
which
is
smaller
,
is
free
from
this
objection
,
and
is
exceedingly
well
adapted
to
the
uses
for
which
it
is
designed
.
 
<EOS>
The
sittings
,
I
need
hardly
add
,
take
place
in
the
day
;
and
the
parliamentary
forms
are
modelled
on
those
of
the
old
country
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
sometimes
asked
,
in
my
progress
through
other
places
,
whether
I
had
not
been
very
much
impressed
by
the
HEADS
of
the
lawmakers
at
Washington
;
<EOS>
meaning
not
their
chiefs
and
leaders
,
but
literally
their
individual
and
personal
heads
,
whereon
their
hair
grew
,
and
whereby
the
phrenological
character
of
each
legislator
was
expressed
:
 
and
I
almost
as
often
struck
my
questioner
dumb
with
indignant
consternation
by
answering
"
No
,
that
I
did
n't
remember
being
at
all
overcome
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
I
must
,
at
whatever
hazard
,
repeat
the
avowal
here
,
I
will
follow
it
up
by
relating
my
impressions
on
this
subject
in
as
few
words
as
possible
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
---
it
may
be
from
some
imperfect
development
of
my
organ
of
veneration
---
I
do
not
remember
having
ever
fainted
away
,
or
having
even
been
moved
to
tears
of
joyful
pride
,
at
sight
of
any
legislative
body
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
borne
the
House
of
Commons
like
a
man
,
and
have
yielded
to
no
weakness
,
but
slumber
,
in
the
House
of
Lords
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
elections
for
borough
and
county
,
and
have
never
been
impelled
(
no
matter
which
party
won
)
to
damage
my
hat
by
throwing
it
up
into
the
air
in
triumph
,
or
to
crack
my
voice
by
shouting
forth
any
reference
to
our
Glorious
Constitution
,
to
the
noble
purity
of
our
independent
voters
,
or
,
the
unimpeachable
integrity
of
our
independent
members
.
 
<EOS>
Having
withstood
such
strong
attacks
upon
my
fortitude
,
it
is
possible
that
I
may
be
of
a
cold
and
insensible
temperament
,
amounting
to
iciness
,
in
such
matters
;
and
therefore
my
impressions
of
the
live
pillars
of
the
Capitol
at
Washington
must
be
received
with
such
grains
of
allowance
as
this
free
confession
may
seem
to
demand
.
   
<EOS>
Did
I
see
in
this
public
body
an
assemblage
of
men
,
bound
together
in
the
sacred
names
of
Liberty
and
Freedom
,
and
so
asserting
the
chaste
dignity
of
those
twin
goddesses
,
in
all
their
discussions
,
as
to
exalt
at
once
the
Eternal
Principles
to
which
their
names
are
given
,
and
their
own
character
and
the
character
of
their
countrymen
,
in
the
admiring
eyes
of
the
whole
world
?
   
<EOS>
It
was
but
<EOS>
a
week
,
since
an
aged
,
grey
-
haired
man
,
a
lasting
honour
to
the
land
that
gave
him
birth
,
who
has
done
good
service
to
his
country
,
as
his
forefathers
did
,
and
who
will
be
remembered
scores
upon
scores
of
years
<EOS>
after
the
worms
bred
in
its
corruption
,
are
but
so
many
grains
of
dust
---
<EOS>
it
was
but
<EOS>
a
week
,
since
this
old
man
had
stood
for
days
upon
his
trial
before
this
very
body
,
charged
with
having
dared
to
assert
the
infamy
of
that
traffic
,
which
has
for
its
accursed
merchandise
men
and
women
,
and
their
unborn
children
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
And
publicly
exhibited
in
the
same
city
all
the
while
;
gilded
,
framed
and
glazed
hung
up
for
general
admiration
;
shown
to
strangers
not
with
shame
,
but
pride
;
its
face
not
turned
towards
the
wall
,
itself
not
taken
down
and
burned
;
is
the
Unanimous
Declaration
of
the
Thirteen
United
States
of
America
,
which
solemnly
declares
that
All
Men
are
created
Equal
;
and
are
endowed
by
their
Creator
with
the
Inalienable
Rights
of
Life
,
Liberty
,
and
the
Pursuit
of
Happiness
!
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
month
,
since
this
same
body
had
sat
calmly
by
,
and
heard
a
man
,
one
of
themselves
,
with
oaths
which
beggars
in
their
drink
reject
,
threaten
to
cut
another
's
throat
from
ear
to
ear
.
<EOS>
There
he
sat
,
among
them
;
not
crushed
by
the
general
feeling
of
the
assembly
,
but
as
good
a
man
as
any
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
but
a
week
to
come
,
and
another
of
that
body
,
for
doing
his
duty
to
those
who
sent
him
there
;
for
claiming
in
a
Republic
the
Liberty
and
Freedom
of
expressing
their
sentiments
,
and
making
known
their
prayer
;
would
be
tried
,
found
guilty
,
and
have
strong
censure
passed
upon
him
by
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
His
was
a
grave
offence
indeed
;
for
years
before
,
he
had
risen
up
and
said
,
"
A
gang
of
male
and
female
slaves
for
sale
,
warranted
to
breed
like
cattle
,
linked
to
each
other
by
iron
fetters
,
are
passing
now
along
the
open
street
beneath
the
windows
of
your
Temple
of
Equality
!
 
<EOS>
Look
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
there
are
many
kinds
of
hunters
engaged
in
the
Pursuit
of
Happiness
,
and
they
go
variously
armed
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
Inalienable
Right
of
some
among
them
,
to
take
the
field
after
THEIR
Happiness
equipped
with
cat
and
cartwhip
,
stocks
,
and
iron
collar
,
and
to
shout
their
view
halloa
!
<EOS>
(
always
in
praise
of
Liberty
)
to
the
music
of
clanking
chains
and
bloody
stripes
.
   
<EOS>
Where
sat
the
many
legislators
of
coarse
threats
;
of
words
and
blows
such
as
coalheavers
deal
upon
each
other
,
when
they
forget
their
breeding
?
 
<EOS>
On
every
side
.
 
<EOS>
Every
session
had
its
anecdotes
of
that
kind
,
and
the
actors
were
all
there
.
   
<EOS>
Did
I
recognise
in
this
assembly
,
a
body
of
men
,
who
,
applying
themselves
in
a
new
world
to
correct
some
of
the
falsehoods
and
vices
of
the
old
,
purified
the
avenues
to
Public
Life
,
paved
the
dirty
ways
to
Place
and
Power
,
debated
and
made
laws
for
the
Common
Good
,
and
had
no
party
but
their
Country
?
   
<EOS>
I
saw
in
them
,
the
wheels
that
move
the
meanest
perversion
of
virtuous
Political
Machinery
that
the
worst
tools
ever
wrought
.
<EOS>
Despicable
trickery
at
elections
;
under
-
handed
tamperings
with
public
officers
<EOS>
;
cowardly
attacks
upon
opponents
,
with
scurrilous
newspapers
for
shields
,
and
hired
pens
for
daggers
;
shameful
trucklings
to
mercenary
knaves
,
whose
claim
to
be
considered
,
is
,
that
every
day
and
week
they
sow
new
crops
of
ruin
with
their
venal
types
,
which
are
the
dragon
's
teeth
of
yore
,
in
everything
but
sharpness
;
aidings
and
abettings
of
every
bad
inclination
in
the
popular
mind
,
and
artful
suppressions
of
all
its
good
influences
:
such
things
as
these
,
and
in
a
word
,
Dishonest
Faction
in
its
most
depraved
and
most
unblushing
form
,
stared
out
from
every
corner
of
the
crowded
hall
.
   
<EOS>
Did
I
see
among
them
,
the
intelligence
and
refinement
:
 
the
true
,
honest
,
patriotic
heart
of
America
?
 
<EOS>
Here
and
there
,
were
drops
of
its
blood
and
life
,
but
they
scarcely
coloured
the
stream
of
desperate
adventurers
which
sets
that
way
for
profit
and
for
pay
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
game
of
these
men
,
and
of
their
profligate
organs
,
to
make
the
strife
of
politics
so
fierce
and
brutal
,
and
so
destructive
of
all
self
-
respect
in
worthy
men
,
that
sensitive
and
delicate
-
minded
persons
shall
be
kept
aloof
,
and
they
,
and
such
as
they
,
be
left
to
battle
out
their
selfish
views
unchecked
.
 
<EOS>
And
thus
this
lowest
of
all
scrambling
fights
goes
on
,
and
they
who
in
other
countries
would
,
from
their
intelligence
and
station
,
most
aspire
to
make
the
laws
<EOS>
,
do
here
recoil
the
farthest
from
that
degradation
.
   
<EOS>
That
there
are
,
among
the
representatives
of
the
people
in
both
Houses
,
and
among
all
parties
,
some
men
of
high
character
and
great
abilities
,
I
need
not
say
.
 
<EOS>
The
foremost
among
those
politicians
who
are
known
in
Europe
,
have
been
already
described
,
and
I
see
no
reason
to
depart
from
the
rule
I
have
laid
down
for
my
guidance
,
of
abstaining
from
all
mention
of
individuals
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
sufficient
to
add
,
<EOS>
that
to
the
most
favourable
accounts
that
have
been
written
of
them
,
I
more
than
fully
and
most
heartily
subscribe
;
and
that
personal
intercourse
and
free
communication
have
bred
within
me
,
not
the
result
predicted
in
the
very
doubtful
proverb
,
but
increased
admiration
and
respect
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
striking
men
to
look
at
,
hard
to
deceive
,
prompt
to
act
,
lions
in
energy
,
Crichtons
in
varied
accomplishments
,
Indians
in
fire
of
eye
and
gesture
,
Americans
in
strong
and
generous
impulse
;
and
they
as
well
represent
the
honour
and
wisdom
of
their
country
at
home
,
as
the
distinguished
gentleman
who
is
now
its
Minister
at
the
British
Court
sustains
its
highest
character
abroad
.
   
<EOS>
I
visited
both
houses
nearly
every
day
,
during
my
stay
in
Washington
.
 
<EOS>
On
my
initiatory
visit
to
the
House
of
Representatives
,
they
divided
against
a
decision
of
the
chair
;
but
the
chair
won
.
 
<EOS>
The
second
time
I
went
,
the
member
who
was
speaking
,
being
interrupted
by
a
laugh
,
mimicked
it
,
as
one
child
would
in
quarrelling
with
another
,
and
added
,
"
that
he
would
make
honourable
gentlemen
opposite
,
sing
out
a
little
more
on
the
other
side
of
their
mouths
presently
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
interruptions
are
rare
;
the
speaker
being
usually
heard
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
more
quarrels
than
with
us
,
and
more
threatenings
than
gentlemen
are
accustomed
to
exchange
in
any
civilised
society
of
which
we
have
record
:
 
but
farm
-
yard
imitations
have
not
as
yet
been
imported
from
the
Parliament
of
the
United
Kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
The
feature
in
oratory
which
appears
to
be
the
most
practised
,
and
most
relished
,
is
the
constant
repetition
of
the
same
idea
or
shadow
of
an
idea
in
fresh
words
;
and
the
inquiry
out
of
doors
is
not
,
"
What
did
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
How
long
did
he
speak
?
"
 
<EOS>
These
,
however
,
are
but
enlargements
of
a
principle
which
prevails
elsewhere
.
   
<EOS>
The
Senate
is
a
dignified
and
decorous
body
,
and
its
proceedings
are
conducted
with
much
gravity
and
order
.
 
<EOS>
Both
houses
are
handsomely
carpeted
;
but
the
state
to
which
these
carpets
are
reduced
by
the
universal
disregard
of
the
spittoon
with
which
every
honourable
member
is
accommodated
,
and
the
extraordinary
improvements
on
the
pattern
which
are
squirted
and
dabbled
upon
it
in
every
direction
,
do
not
admit
of
being
described
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
merely
observe
,
that
I
strongly
recommend
all
strangers
not
to
look
at
the
floor
;
and
if
they
happen
to
drop
anything
,
though
it
be
their
purse
,
not
to
pick
it
up
with
an
ungloved
hand
on
any
account
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
somewhat
remarkable
too
,
at
first
,
to
say
the
least
,
to
see
so
many
honourable
members
with
swelled
faces
;
and
it
is
scarcely
less
remarkable
to
discover
that
this
appearance
is
caused
by
the
quantity
of
tobacco
they
contrive
to
stow
within
the
hollow
of
the
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
strange
enough
too
,
to
see
an
honourable
gentleman
leaning
back
in
his
tilted
chair
with
his
legs
on
the
desk
before
him
,
shaping
a
convenient
"
plug
"
with
his
penknife
,
and
when
it
is
quite
ready
for
use
,
shooting
the
old
one
from
his
mouth
,
as
from
a
pop
-
gun
,
and
clapping
the
new
one
in
its
place
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
surprised
to
observe
that
even
steady
old
chewers
of
great
experience
,
are
not
always
good
marksmen
,
which
has
rather
inclined
me
to
doubt
that
general
proficiency
with
the
rifle
,
of
which
we
have
heard
so
much
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
Several
gentlemen
called
upon
me
who
,
in
the
course
of
conversation
,
frequently
missed
the
spittoon
at
five
paces
;
and
one
(
<EOS>
but
he
was
certainly
short
-
sighted
)
<EOS>
mistook
the
closed
sash
for
the
open
window
,
at
three
.
 
<EOS>
On
another
occasion
,
when
I
dined
out
,
and
was
sitting
with
two
ladies
and
some
gentlemen
round
a
fire
before
dinner
<EOS>
,
one
of
the
company
fell
short
of
the
fireplace
,
six
distinct
times
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
disposed
to
think
,
however
,
that
this
was
occasioned
by
his
not
aiming
at
that
object
;
as
there
was
a
white
marble
hearth
before
the
fender
,
which
was
more
convenient
,
and
may
have
suited
his
purpose
better
.
   
<EOS>
The
Patent
Office
at
Washington
,
furnishes
an
extraordinary
example
of
American
enterprise
and
ingenuity
;
for
the
immense
number
of
models
it
contains
are
the
accumulated
inventions
of
only
five
years
;
the
whole
of
the
previous
collection
having
been
destroyed
by
fire
.
 
<EOS>
The
elegant
structure
in
which
they
are
arranged
is
one
of
design
rather
than
execution
,
for
there
is
but
one
side
erected
out
of
four
,
though
the
works
are
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
The
Post
Office
is
a
very
compact
and
very
beautiful
building
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
of
the
departments
,
among
a
collection
of
rare
and
curious
articles
,
are
deposited
the
presents
which
have
been
made
from
time
to
time
to
the
American
ambassadors
at
foreign
courts
by
the
various
potentates
to
whom
they
were
the
accredited
agents
of
the
Republic
;
gifts
<EOS>
which
by
the
law
they
are
not
permitted
to
retain
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
that
I
looked
upon
this
as
a
very
painful
exhibition
,
and
one
by
no
means
flattering
to
the
national
standard
of
honesty
and
honour
.
<EOS>
That
can
scarcely
be
a
high
state
of
moral
feeling
which
imagines
a
gentleman
of
repute
and
station
,
likely
to
be
corrupted
,
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
,
by
the
present
of
a
snuff
-
box
,
or
a
richly
-
mounted
sword
,
or
an
Eastern
shawl
;
and
surely
the
Nation
who
reposes
confidence
in
her
appointed
servants
,
is
likely
to
be
better
served
,
than
she
who
makes
them
the
subject
of
such
very
mean
and
paltry
suspicions
.

At
George
Town
,
in
the
suburbs
,
there
is
a
Jesuit
College
;
delightfully
situated
,
and
,
so
far
as
I
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
,
well
managed
.
 
<EOS>
Many
persons
who
are
not
members
of
the
Romish
Church
,
avail
themselves
,
I
believe
,
of
these
institutions
,
and
of
the
advantageous
opportunities
they
afford
for
the
education
of
their
children
.
 
<EOS>
The
heights
of
this
neighbourhood
,
above
the
Potomac
River
,
are
very
picturesque
:
 
and
are
free
,
I
should
conceive
,
from
some
of
the
insalubrities
of
Washington
.
 
<EOS>
The
air
,
at
that
elevation
,
was
quite
cool
and
refreshing
,
when
in
the
city
it
was
burning
hot

The
President
's
mansion
is
more
like
an
English
club
-
house
,
both
within
and
without
,
than
any
other
kind
of
establishment
with
which
I
can
compare
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
ornamental
ground
about
it
has
been
laid
out
in
garden
walks
;
they
are
pretty
,
and
agreeable
to
the
eye
;
though
they
have
that
uncomfortable
air
of
having
been
made
yesterday
,
which
is
far
from
favourable
to
the
display
of
such
beauties
.
   
<EOS>
My
first
visit
to
this
house
was
on
the
morning
after
my
arrival
,
when
I
was
carried
thither
by
an
official
gentleman
,
who
was
so
kind
as
to
charge
himself
with
my
presentation
to
the
President
.
   
<EOS>
We
entered
a
large
hall
,
and
having
twice
or
thrice
rung
a
bell
which
nobody
answered
,
walked
without
further
ceremony
through
the
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
,
as
divers
other
gentlemen
(
mostly
with
their
hats
on
,
and
their
hands
in
their
pockets
)
were
doing
very
leisurely
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
these
had
ladies
with
them
,
to
whom
they
were
showing
the
premises
;
others
were
lounging
on
the
chairs
and
sofas
;
others
,
in
a
perfect
state
of
exhaustion
from
listlessness
,
were
yawning
drearily
.
 
<EOS>
The
greater
portion
of
this
assemblage
were
rather
asserting
their
supremacy
than
doing
anything
else
,
as
they
had
no
particular
business
there
,
that
anybody
knew
of
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
were
closely
eyeing
the
movables
,
as
if
to
make
quite
sure
that
the
President
(
who
was
far
from
popular
)
had
not
made
away
with
any
of
the
furniture
,
or
sold
the
fixtures
for
his
private
benefit
.
   
<EOS>
After
glancing
at
these
loungers
;
who
were
scattered
over
a
pretty
drawing
-
room
,
opening
upon
a
terrace
which
commanded
a
beautiful
prospect
of
the
river
and
the
adjacent
country
;
and
who
were
sauntering
,
too
,
about
a
larger
state
-
room
called
the
Eastern
Drawing
-
room
;
we
went
up
-
stairs
into
another
chamber
,
where
were
certain
visitors
,
waiting
for
audiences
.
 
<EOS>
At
sight
of
my
conductor
,
a
black
in
plain
clothes
and
yellow
slippers
who
was
gliding
noiselessly
about
,
and
whispering
messages
in
the
ears
of
the
more
impatient
,
made
a
sign
of
recognition
,
and
glided
off
to
announce
him
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
previously
looked
into
another
chamber
fitted
all
round
with
a
great
,
bare
,
wooden
desk
or
counter
,
whereon
lay
files
of
newspapers
,
to
which
sundry
gentlemen
were
referring
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
were
no
such
means
of
beguiling
the
time
in
this
apartment
,
which
was
as
unpromising
and
tiresome
as
any
waiting
-
room
in
one
of
our
public
establishments
,
or
any
physician
's
dining
-
room
during
his
hours
of
consultation
at
home
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
some
fifteen
or
twenty
persons
in
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
One
,
a
tall
,
wiry
,
muscular
old
man
,
from
the
west
;
sunburnt
and
swarthy
;
with
a
brown
white
hat
on
his
knees
,
and
a
giant
umbrella
resting
between
his
legs
;
who
sat
bolt
upright
in
his
chair
,
frowning
steadily
at
the
carpet
,
and
twitching
the
hard
lines
about
his
mouth
,
as
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
"
to
fix
"
the
President
on
what
he
had
to
say
,
and
would
n't
bate
him
a
grain
.
 
<EOS>
Another
,
a
Kentucky
farmer
,
six
-
feet
-
six
in
height
,
with
his
hat
on
,
and
his
hands
under
his
coat
-
tails
,
who
leaned
against
the
wall
and
kicked
the
floor
with
his
heel
,
as
though
he
had
Time
's
head
under
his
shoe
,
and
were
literally
"
killing
"
him
.
 
<EOS>
A
third
,
an
oval
-
faced
,
bilious
-
looking
man
,
with
sleek
black
hair
cropped
close
,
and
whiskers
and
beard
shaved
down
to
blue
dots
,
who
sucked
the
head
of
a
thick
stick
,
and
from
time
to
time
took
it
out
of
his
mouth
,
to
see
how
it
was
getting
on
.
 
<EOS>
A
fourth
did
nothing
but

A
fifth
did
nothing
but
spit
.
 
<EOS>
And
indeed
all
these
gentlemen
were
so
very
persevering
and
energetic
in
this
latter
particular
,
and
bestowed
their
favours
so
abundantly
upon
the
carpet
,
that
I
take
it
for
granted
the
Presidential
housemaids
<EOS>
have
high
wages
,
or
,
to
speak
more
genteelly
,
an
ample
amount
of
"
compensation
:
"
which
is
the
American
word
for
salary
,
in
the
case
of
all
public
servants
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
not
waited
in
this
room
many
minutes
,
before
the
black
messenger
returned
,
and
conducted
us
into
another
of
smaller
dimensions
,
where
,
at
a
business
-
like
table
covered
with
papers
,
sat
the
President
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
somewhat
worn
and
anxious
,
and
well
he
might
;
being
at
war
with
everybody
---
but
the
expression
of
his
face
was
mild
and
pleasant
,
and
his
manner
was
remarkably
unaffected
,
gentlemanly
,
and
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
that
in
his
whole
carriage
and
demeanour
,
he
became
his
station
singularly
well
.
   
<EOS>
Being
advised
that
the
sensible
etiquette
of
the
republican
court
admitted
of
a
traveller
,
like
myself
,
declining
,
without
any
impropriety
,
an
invitation
to
dinner
,
which
did
not
reach
me
until
I
had
concluded
my
arrangements
for
leaving
Washington
some
days
before
that
<EOS>
to
which
it
referred
,
I
only
returned
to
this
house
once
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
on
the
occasion
of
one
of
those
general
assemblies
which
are
held
on
certain
nights
,
between
the
hours
of
nine
and
twelve
o'clock
,
and
are
called
,
rather
oddly
,
Levees
.
   
<EOS>
I
went
,
with
my
wife
,
at
about
ten
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
pretty
dense
crowd
of
carriages
and
people
in
the
court
-
yard
,
and
so
far
as
I
could
make
out
,
there
were
no
very
clear
regulations
for
the
taking
up
or
setting
down
of
company
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
certainly
no
policemen
to
soothe
startled
horses
,
either
by
sawing
at
their
bridles
or
flourishing
truncheons
in
their
eyes
;
and
I
am
ready
to
make
oath
that
no
inoffensive
persons
were
knocked
violently
on
the
head
,
or
poked
acutely
in
their
backs
or
stomachs
;
or
brought
to
a
standstill
by
any
such
gentle
means
,
and
then
taken
into
custody
for
not
moving
on
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
confusion
or
disorder
.
 
<EOS>
Our
carriage
reached
the
porch
in
its
turn
,
without
any
blustering
,
swearing
,
shouting
,
backing
,
or
other
disturbance
:
 
and
we
dismounted
with
as
much
ease
and
comfort
as
though
we
had
been
escorted
by
the
whole
Metropolitan
Force
from
A
to
Z
inclusive
.
   
<EOS>
The
suite
of
rooms
on
the
ground
-
floor
were
lighted
up
,
and
a
military
band
was
playing
in
the
hall
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
smaller
drawing
-
room
,
the
centre
of
a
circle
of
company
,
were
the
President
and
his
daughter
-
in
-
law
,
who
acted
as
the
lady
of
the
mansion
;
and
a
very
interesting
,
graceful
,
and
accomplished
lady
too
.
 
<EOS>
One
gentleman
who
stood
among
this
group
,
appeared
to
take
upon
himself
the
functions
of
a
master
of
the
ceremonies
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
no
other
officers
or
attendants
,
and
none
were
needed
.
   
<EOS>
The
great
drawing
-
room
,
which
I
have
already
mentioned
,
and
the
other
chambers
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
were
crowded
to
excess
.
 
<EOS>
The
company
was
not
,
in
our
sense
of
the
term
,
select
,
for
it
comprehended
persons
of
very
many
grades
and
classes
;
nor
was
there
any
great
display
of
costly
attire
:
 
indeed
,
some
of
the
costumes
may
have
been
,
for
aught
I
know
,
grotesque
enough
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
decorum
and
propriety
of
behaviour
which
prevailed
,
were
unbroken
by
any
rude
or
disagreeable
incident
;
and
every
man
,
even
among
the
miscellaneous
crowd
in
the
hall
who
were
admitted
without
any
orders
or
tickets
to
look
on
,
appeared
to
feel
that
he
was
a
part
of
the
Institution
,
and
was
responsible
for
its
preserving
a
becoming
character
,
and
appearing
to
the
best
advantage
.
   
<EOS>
That
these
visitors
,
too
,
whatever
their
station
,
were
not
without
some
refinement
of
taste
and
appreciation
of
intellectual
gifts
,
and
gratitude
to
those
men
who
,
by
the
peaceful
exercise
of
great
abilities
,
shed
new
charms
and
associations
upon
the
homes
of
their
countrymen
,
and
elevate
their
character
in
other
lands
,
was
most
earnestly
testified
by
their
reception
of
Washington
Irving
,
my
dear
friend
,
who
had
recently
been
appointed
Minister
at
the
court
of
Spain
,
and
who
was
among
them
that
night
,
in
his
new
character
,
for
the
first
and
last
time
before
going
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
I
sincerely
believe
that
in
all
the
madness
of
American
politics
,
few
public
men
would
have
been
so
earnestly
,
devotedly
,
and
affectionately
caressed
,
as
this
most
charming
writer
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
seldom
respected
a
public
assembly
more
,
than
I
did
this
eager
throng
,
when
I
saw
them
turning
with
one
mind
from
noisy
orators
and
officers
of
state
,
and
flocking
with
a
generous
and
honest
impulse
round
the
man
of
quiet
pursuits
:
 
proud
in
his
promotion
as
reflecting
back
upon
their
country
:
 
and
grateful
to
him
with
their
whole
hearts
for
the
store
of
graceful
fancies
he
had
poured
out
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
Long
may
he
dispense
such
treasures
with
unsparing
hand
;
and
long
may
they
remember
him
as
worthily
!
   
<EOS>
The
term
we
had
assigned
for
the
duration
of
our
stay
in
Washington
was
now
at
an
end
,
and
we
were
to
begin
to
travel
;
for
the
railroad
distances
we
had
traversed
yet
,
in
journeying
among
these
older
towns
,
are
on
that
great
continent
looked
upon
as
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
at
first
intended
going
South
---
to
Charleston
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
I
came
to
consider
the
length
of
time
which
this
journey
would
occupy
,
and
the
premature
heat
of
the
season
,
which
even
at
Washington
had
been
often
very
trying
;
and
weighed
moreover
,
in
my
own
mind
,
the
pain
of
living
in
the
constant
contemplation
of
slavery
,
against
the
more
than
doubtful
chances
of
my
ever
seeing
it
,
in
the
time
I
had
to
spare
,
stripped
of
the
disguises
in
which
it
would
certainly
be
dressed
,
and
so
adding
any
item
to
the
host
of
facts
already
heaped
together
on
the
subject
;
I
began
to
listen
to
old
whisperings
which
had
often
been
present
to
me
at
home
in
England
,
when
I
little
thought
of
ever
being
here
;
and
to
dream
again
of
cities
growing
up
,
like
palaces
in
fairy
tales
,
among
the
wilds
and
forests
of
the
west
.
   
<EOS>
The
advice
I
received
in
most
quarters
when
I
began
to
yield
to
my
desire
of
travelling
towards
that
point
of
the
compass
was
,
according
to
custom
,
sufficiently
cheerless
:
 
<EOS>
my
companion
being
threatened
with
more
perils
,
dangers
,
and
discomforts
,
than
I
can
remember
or
would
catalogue
if
I
could
;
but
of
which
it
will
be
sufficient
to
remark
that
blowings
-
up
in
steamboats
and
breakings
-
down
in
coaches
were
among
the
least
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
having
a
western
route
sketched
out
for
me
by
the
best
and
kindest
authority
to
which
I
could
have
resorted
,
and
putting
no
great
faith
in
these
discouragements
,
I
soon
determined
on
my
plan
of
action
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
to
travel
south
,
only
to
Richmond
in
Virginia
;
and
then
to
turn
,
and
shape
our
course
for
the
Far
West
;
whither
I
beseech
the
reader
's
company
,
in
a
new
chapter
.

WE
were
to
proceed
in
the
first
instance
by
steamboat
;
and
as
it
is
usual
to
sleep
on
board
,
in
consequence
of
the
starting
-
hour
being
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
we
went
down
to
where
she
lay
,
at
that
very
uncomfortable
time
for
such
expeditions
when
slippers
are
most
valuable
,
and
a
familiar
bed
,
in
the
perspective
of
an
hour
or
two
,
looks
uncommonly
pleasant
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
ten
o'clock
at
night
:
 
say
<EOS>
half
-
past
ten
:
 
moonlight
,
warm
,
and
dull
enough
.
 
<EOS>
The
steamer
(
not
unlike
a
child
's
Noah
's
ark
in
form
,
with
the
machinery
on
the
top
of
the
roof
)
is
riding
lazily
up
and
down
,
and
bumping
clumsily
against
the
wooden
pier
,
as
the
ripple
of
the
river
trifles
with
its
unwieldy
carcase
.
 
<EOS>
The
wharf
is
some
distance
from
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
nobody
down
here
;
and
one
or
two
dull
lamps
upon
the
steamer
's
decks
are
the
only
signs
of
life
remaining
,
when
our
coach
has
driven
away
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
our
footsteps
are
heard
upon
the
planks
,
a
fat
negress
,
particularly
favoured
by
nature
in
respect
of
bustle
,
emerges
from
some
dark
stairs
,
and
marshals
my
wife
towards
the
ladies
'
cabin
,
to
which
retreat
she
goes
,
followed
by
a
mighty
bale
of
cloaks
and
great
-
coats
.
<EOS>
I
valiantly
resolve
not
to
go
to
bed
at
all
,
but
to
walk
up
and
down
the
pier
till
morning
.
   
<EOS>
I
begin
my
promenade
---
thinking
of
all
kinds
of
distant
things
and
persons
,
and
of
nothing
near
---
and
pace
up
and
down
for
half
-
an
-
hour
.
<EOS>
Then
I
go
on
board
again
;
and
getting
into
the
light
of
one
of
the
lamps
,
look
at
my
watch
and
think
it
must
have
stopped
;
and
wonder
what
has
become
of
the
faithful
secretary
whom
I
brought
along
with
me
from
Boston
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
supping
with
our
late
landlord
(
a
Field
Marshal
,
at
least
,
no
doubt
)
in
honour
of
our
departure
,
and
may
be
two
hours
longer
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
again
,
but
it
gets
duller
and
duller
:
 
<EOS>
the
moon
goes
down
:
 
<EOS>
next
June
seems
farther
off
in
the
dark
,
and
the
echoes
of
my
footsteps
make
me
nervous
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
turned
cold
too
;
and
walking
up
and
down
without
my
companion
in
such
lonely
circumstances
,
is
but
poor
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
break
my
staunch
resolution
,
and
think
it
may
be
,
perhaps
,
as
well
to
go
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
I
go
on
board
again
;
open
the
door
of
the
gentlemen
's
cabin
and
walk
in
.
 
<EOS>
Somehow
or
other
---
from
its
being
so
quiet
,
I
suppose
---
I
have
taken
it
into
my
head
that
there
is
nobody
there
.
 
<EOS>
To
my
horror
and
amazement
<EOS>
it
is
full
of
sleepers
in
every
stage
,
shape
,
attitude
,
and
variety
of
slumber
:
 
in
the
berths
,
on
the
chairs
,
on
the
floors
,
on
the
tables
,
and
particularly
round
the
stove
,
my
detested
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
another
step
forward
,
and
slip
on
the
shining
face
of
a
black
steward
,
who
lies
rolled
in
a
blanket
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
He
jumps
up
,
grins
,
half
in
pain
and
half
in
hospitality
;
<EOS>
whispers
my
own
name
in
my
ear
;
and
groping
among
the
sleepers
,
leads
me
to
my
berth
.
 
<EOS>
Standing
beside
it
,
I
count
these
slumbering
passengers
,
and
get
past
forty
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
use
in
going
further
,
so
I
begin
to
undress
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
chairs
are
all
occupied
,
and
there
is
nothing
else
to
put
my
clothes
on
,
I
deposit
them
upon
the
ground
:
 
not
without
soiling
my
hands
,
for
it
is
in
the
same
condition
as
the
carpets
in
the
Capitol
,
and
from
the
same
cause
.
 
<EOS>
Having
but
partially
undressed
,
I
clamber
on
my
shelf
,
and
hold
the
curtain
open
for
a
few
minutes
while
I
look
round
on
all
my
fellow
-
travellers
again
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
I
let
it
fall
on
them
,
and
on
the
world
:
 
turn
round
:
 
and
go
to
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
I
wake
,
of
course
,
when
we
get
under
weigh
,
for
there
is
a
good
deal
of
noise
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
is
then
just
breaking
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
wakes
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
Some
are
self
-
possessed
directly
,
and
some
are
much
perplexed
to
make
out
where
they
are
until
they
have
rubbed
their
eyes
,
and
leaning
on
one
elbow
,
looked
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
Some
yawn
,
some
groan
,
nearly
all
spit
,
and
a
few
get
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
among
the
risers
:
for
it
is
easy
to
feel
,
without
going
into
the
fresh
air
,
that
the
atmosphere
of
the
cabin
is
vile
in
the
last
degree
.
 
<EOS>
I
huddle
on
my
clothes
,
go
down
into
the
fore
-
cabin
,
get
shaved
by
the
barber
,
and
wash
myself
.
 
<EOS>
The
washing
and
dressing
apparatus
for
the
passengers
generally
<EOS>
,
consists
of
two
jack
-
towels
,
three
small
wooden
basins
,
a
keg
of
water
and
a
ladle
to
serve
it
out
with
,
six
square
inches
of
looking
-
glass
,
two
ditto
ditto
of
yellow
soap
,
a
comb
and
brush
for
the
head
,
and
nothing
for
the
teeth
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
uses
the
comb
and
brush
,
except
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
stares
to
see
me
using
my
own
;
and
two
or
three
gentlemen
are
strongly
disposed
to
banter
me
on
my
prejudices
,
but
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
have
made
my
toilet
,
I
go
upon
the
hurricane
-
deck
,
and
set
in
for
two
hours
of
hard
walking
up
and
down
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
is
rising
brilliantly
;
we
are
passing
Mount
Vernon
,
where
Washington
lies
buried
;
the
river
is
wide
and
rapid
;
and
its
banks
are
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
glory
and
splendour
of
the
day
are
coming
on
,
and
growing
brighter
every
minute
.
   
<EOS>
At
eight
o'clock
,
we
breakfast
in
the
cabin
where
I
passed
the
night
,
but
the
windows
and
doors
are
all
thrown
open
,
and
now
it
is
fresh
enough
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
hurry
or
greediness
apparent
in
the
despatch
of
the
meal
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
longer
than
a
travelling
breakfast
with
us
;
more
orderly
,
and
more
polite
.
   
<EOS>
Soon
after
nine
o'clock
we
come
to
Potomac
Creek
,
where
we
are
to
land
;
and
then
comes
the
oddest
part
of
the
journey
.
 
<EOS>
Seven
stage
-
coaches
are
preparing
to
carry
us
on
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
them
are
ready
,
some
of
them
are
not
ready
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
drivers
are
blacks
,
some
whites
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
four
horses
to
each
coach
,
and
all
the
horses
,
harnessed
or
unharnessed
,
are
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
passengers
are
getting
out
of
the
steamboat
,
and
into
the
coaches
;
the
luggage
is
being
transferred
in
noisy
wheelbarrows
;
the
horses
are
frightened
,
and
impatient
to
start
;
the
black
drivers
are
chattering
to
them
like
so
many
monkeys
;
and
the
white
ones
whooping
like
so
many
drovers
:
for
the
main
thing
to
be
done
in
all
kinds
of
hostlering
here
,
is
to
make
as
much
noise
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
The
coaches
are
something
like
the
French
coaches
,
but
not
nearly
so
good
.
 
<EOS>
In
lieu
of
springs
,
they
are
hung
on
bands
of
the
strongest
leather
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
very
little
choice
or
difference
between
them
;
and
they
may
be
likened
to
the
car
portion
of
the
swings
at
an
English
fair
,
roofed
,
put
upon
axle
-
trees
and
wheels
,
and
curtained
with
painted
canvas
.
<EOS>
They
are
covered
with
mud
from
the
roof
to
the
wheel
-
tire
,
and
have
never
been
cleaned
since
they
were
first
built
.
   
<EOS>
The
tickets
we
have
received
on
board
the
steamboat
are
marked
No%
1
,
so
we
belong
to
coach
<EOS>
No%
1
.
 
<EOS>
I
throw
my
coat
on
the
box
,
and
hoist
my
wife
and
her
maid
into
the
inside
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
only
one
step
,
and
that
being
about
a
yard
from
the
ground
,
is
usually
approached
by
a
chair
:
 
when
there
is
no
chair
,
ladies
trust
in
Providence
.
<EOS>
The
coach
holds
nine
inside
,
having
a
seat
across
from
door
to
door
,
where
we
in
England
put
our
legs
:
 
so
that
there
is
only
one
feat
more
difficult
in
the
performance
than
getting
in
,
and
that
is
,
getting
out
again
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
only
one
outside
passenger
,
and
he
sits
upon
the
box
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
am
that
one
,
I
climb
up
;
and
while
they
are
strapping
the
luggage
on
the
roof
,
and
heaping
it
into
a
kind
of
tray
behind
,
have
a
good
opportunity
of
looking
at
the
driver
.
   
<EOS>
He
is
a
negro
---
very
black
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
dressed
in
a
coarse
pepper
-
and
-
salt
suit
excessively
patched
and
darned
(
particularly
at
the
knees
)
,
grey
stockings
,
enormous
unblacked
high
-
low
shoes
,
and
very
short
trousers
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
two
odd
gloves
:
 
one
of
parti
-
coloured
worsted
,
and
one
of
leather
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
very
short
whip
,
broken
in
the
middle
and
bandaged
up
with
string
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
he
wears
a
low
-
crowned
,
broad
-
brimmed
,
black
hat
:
 
faintly
shadowing
forth
a
kind
of
insane
imitation
of
an
English
coachman
!
 
<EOS>
But
somebody
in
authority
cries
"
Go
ahead
!
"
<EOS>
as
I
am
making
these
observations
.
 
<EOS>
The
mail
takes
the
lead
in
a
four
-
horse
waggon
,
and
all
the
coaches
follow
in
procession
:
 
headed
by
No%
1
.
   
<EOS>
By
the
way
,
whenever
an
Englishman
would
cry
"
All
right
!
"
<EOS>
an
American
cries
"
Go
ahead
!
"
which
is
somewhat
expressive
of
the
national
character
of
the
two
countries
.
   
<EOS>
The
first
half
-
mile
of
the
road
is
over
bridges
made
of
loose
planks
laid
across
two
parallel
poles
,
which
tilt
up
as
the
wheels
roll
over
them
;
and
IN
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
The
river
has
a
clayey
bottom
and
is
full
of
holes
,
so
that
half
a
horse
is
constantly
disappearing
unexpectedly
,
and
ca
n't
be
found
again
for
some
time
.
   
<EOS>
But
we
get
past
even
this
,
and
come
to
the
road
itself
,
which
is
a
series
of
alternate
swamps
and
gravel
-
pits
.
 
<EOS>
A
tremendous
place
is
close
before
us
,
the
black
driver
rolls
his
eyes
,
screws
his
mouth
up
very
round
,
and
looks
straight
between
the
two
leaders
,
as
if
he
were
saying
to
himself
,
<EOS>
"
We
have
done
this
often
before
,
but
NOW
I
think
we
shall
have
a
crash
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
takes
a
rein
in
each
hand
;
jerks
and
pulls
at
both
;
and
dances
on
the
splashboard
with
both
feet
(
keeping
his
seat
,
of
course
)
like
the
late
lamented
Ducrow
on
two
of
his
fiery
coursers
.
 
<EOS>
We
come
to
the
spot
,
sink
down
in
the
mire
nearly
to
the
coach
windows
,
tilt
on
one
side
at
an
angle
of
forty
-
five
degrees
,
and
stick
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
insides
scream
dismally
;
the
coach
stops
;
the
horses
flounder
;
all
the
other
six
coaches
stop
;
and
their
four
-
and
-
twenty
horses
flounder
likewise
:
 
but
merely
for
company
,
and
in
sympathy
with
ours
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
following
circumstances
occur
.
    
<EOS>
BLACK

Why

Gentleman
receives
a

of

and
draws
his

his

BLACK

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Horses
pull
violently
,
drag
the
coach
out
of
the
hole
,
and
draw
it
up
a
bank
;
so
steep
,
that
the
black
driver
's
legs
fly
up
into
the
air
,
and
he
goes
back
among
the
luggage
on
the
roof
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
immediately
recovers
himself
,
and
cries
(
still
to
the
horses
)
,
   
"
Pill

"
   
<EOS>
No
effect
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
the
coach
begins
to
roll
back
upon
No%
2
,
which
rolls
back
upon
No%
3
,
which
rolls
back
upon
No%
4

and
so
on
,
until
No%

heard

nearly
a
quarter

a
mile
behind

<EOS>
BLACK

(
louder
than
before

<EOS>
"

Horses
make
another
struggle
to
get
up
the

again
the

rolls
backward

They
run
up
the
bank
,
and
go
down
again
on
the
other
side
at
a
fearful
pace
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
stop
them
,
and
at
the
bottom
there
is
a
deep
hollow
,
full
of
water
.
 
<EOS>
The
coach
rolls
frightfully
.
 
<EOS>
The
insides
scream
.
 
<EOS>
The
mud
and
water
fly
about
us
.
<EOS>
The
black
driver
dances
like
a
madman
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
we
are
all
right
by
some
extraordinary
means
,
and
stop
to
breathe
.
   
<EOS>
A
black
friend
of
the
black
driver
is
sitting
on
a
fence
.
 
<EOS>
The
black
driver
recognises
him
by
twirling
his
head
round
and
round
like
a
harlequin
,
rolling
his
eyes
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
and
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
.
 
<EOS>
He
stops
short
,
turns
to
me
,
and
says
:
   
<EOS>
"
We
shall
get

The

grins
again
,
but
there
is
another
hole
,
and
beyond
that

another
bank
,
close
before
us

So
he
stops
short

until
we
are
reduced
to
the
very
last
extremity
,
and
are
in
the
midst
of
difficulties
,
extrication
from
which
appears
to
be
all
but
impossible
.
   
<EOS>
And
so
we
do
the
ten
miles
or
thereabouts
in
two
hours
and
a
half
;
breaking
no
bones
,
though
bruising
a
great

This
singular
kind
of
coaching
terminates
at
Fredericksburgh
,
whence
there
is
a
railway
to
Richmond
.
 
<EOS>
The
tract
of
country
through
which
it
takes
its
course
was
once
productive
;
but
the
soil
has
been
exhausted
by
the
system
of
employing
a
great
amount
of
slave
labour
in
forcing
crops
,
without
strengthening
the
land
:
 
and
it
is
now
little
better
than
a
sandy
desert
overgrown
with
trees
.
<EOS>
Dreary
and
uninteresting
as
its
aspect
is
,
I
was
glad
to
the
heart
to
find
anything
on
which
one
of
the
curses
of
this
horrible
institution
has
fallen
;
and
had
greater
pleasure
in
contemplating
the
withered
ground
,
than
the
richest
and
most
thriving
cultivation
in
the
same
place
could
possibly
have
afforded
me
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
district
,
as
in
all
others
where
slavery
sits
brooding
,
(
I
have
frequently
heard
this
admitted
,
even
by
those
who
are
its
warmest
advocates
:
)
<EOS>
there
is
an
air
of
ruin
and
decay
abroad
,
which
is
inseparable
from
the
system
.
 
<EOS>
The
barns
and
outhouses
are
mouldering
away
;
the
sheds
are
patched
and
half
roofless
;
the
log
cabins
(
built
in
Virginia
with
external
chimneys
made
of
clay
or
wood
)
are
squalid
in
the
last
degree
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
look
of
decent
comfort
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
The
miserable
stations
by
the
railway
side
,
the
great
wild
wood
-
yards
,
whence
the
engine
is
supplied
with
fuel
;
the
negro
children
rolling
on
the
ground
before
the
cabin
doors
,
with
dogs
and
pigs
;
the
biped
beasts
of
burden
slinking
past
:
 
gloom
and
dejection
are
upon
them
all
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
negro
car
belonging
to
the
train
in
which
we
made
this
journey
,
were
a
mother
and
her
children
who
had
just
been
purchased
;
the
husband
and
father
being
left
behind
with
their
old
owner
.
 
<EOS>
The
children
cried
the
whole
way
,
and
the
mother
was
misery
's
picture
.
 
<EOS>
The
champion
of
Life
,
Liberty
,
and
the
Pursuit
of
Happiness
,
who
had
bought
them
,
rode
in
the
same
train
;
and
,
every
time
we
stopped
,
got
down
to
see
that
they
were
safe
.
 
<EOS>
The
black
in
Sinbad
's
Travels
with
one
eye
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
which
shone
like
a
burning
coal
,
was
nature
's
aristocrat
compared
with
this
white
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
between
six
and
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
when
we
drove
to
the
hotel
:
 
in
front
of
which
,
and
on
the
top
of
the
broad
flight
of
steps
leading
to
the
door
,
two
or
three
citizens
were
balancing
themselves
on
rocking
-
chairs
,
and
smoking
cigars
.
 
<EOS>
We
found
it
a
very
large
and
elegant
establishment
,
and
were
as
well
entertained
as
travellers
need
desire
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
The
climate
being
a
thirsty
one
,
there
was
never
,
at
any
hour
of
the
day
,
a
scarcity
of
loungers
in
the
spacious
bar
,
or
a
cessation
of
the
mixing
of
cool
liquors
:
 
but
they
were
a
merrier
people
here
,
and
had
musical
instruments
playing
to
them
<EOS>
o
'
nights
,
which
it
was
a
treat
to
hear
again
.
   
<EOS>
The
next
day
,
and
the
next
,
we
rode
and
walked
about
the
town
,
which
is
delightfully
situated
on
eight
hills
,
overhanging
James
River
;
a
sparkling
stream
,
studded
here
and
there
with
bright
islands
,
or
brawling
over
broken
rocks
.
 
<EOS>
Although
it
was
yet
<EOS>
but
the
middle
of
March
,
the
weather
in
this
southern
temperature
was
extremely
warm
;
the
peech
-
trees
and
magnolias
were
in
full
bloom
;
and
the
trees
were
green
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
low
ground
among
the
hills
,
is
a
valley
known
as
"
Bloody
Run
,
"
from
a
terrible
conflict
with
the
Indians
which
once
occurred
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
good
place
for
such
a
struggle
,
and
,
like
every
other
spot
I
saw
associated
with
any
legend
of
that
wild
people
now
so
rapidly
fading
from
the
earth
,
interested
me
very
much
.
   
<EOS>
The
city
is
the
seat
of
the
local
parliament
of
Virginia
;
and
in
its
shady
legislative
halls
,
some
orators
were
drowsily
holding
forth
to
the
hot
noon
day
.
 
<EOS>
By
dint
of
constant
repetition
,
however
,
these
constitutional
sights
had
very
little
more
interest
for
me
than
so
many
parochial
vestries
;
and
I
was
glad
to
exchange
this
one
for
a
lounge
in
a
well
-
arranged
public
library
of
some
ten
thousand
volumes
,
and
a
visit
to
a
tobacco
manufactory
,
where
the
workmen
are
all
slaves
.
   
<EOS>
I
saw
in
this
place
the
whole
process
of
picking
,
rolling
,
pressing
,
drying
,
packing
in
casks
,
and
branding
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
tobacco
thus
dealt
with
,
was
in
course
of
manufacture
for
chewing
;
and
one
would
have
supposed
there
was
enough
in
that
one
storehouse
to
have
filled
even
the
comprehensive
jaws
of
America
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
form
,
the
weed
looks
like
the
oil
-
cake
on
which
we
fatten
cattle
;
and
even
without
reference
to
its
consequences
,
is
sufficiently
uninviting
.
   
<EOS>
Many
of
the
workmen
appeared
to
be
strong
men
,
and
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
they
were
all
labouring
quietly
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
After
two
o'clock
in
the
day
,
they
are
allowed
to
sing
,
a
certain
number
at
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
hour
striking
while
I
was
there
,
some
twenty
sang
a
hymn
in
parts
,
and
sang
it
by
no
means
ill
;
pursuing
their
work
meanwhile
.
 
<EOS>
A
bell
rang
as
I
was
about
to
leave
,
and
they
all
poured
forth
into
a
building
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
several
times
that
I
should
like
to
see
them
at
their
meal
;
but
as
the
gentleman
to
whom
I
mentioned
this
desire
appeared
to
be
suddenly
taken
rather
deaf
,
I
did
not
pursue
the
request
.
 
<EOS>
Of
their
appearance
I
shall
have
something
to
say
,
presently
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
,
I
visited
a
plantation
or
farm
,
of
about
twelve
hundred
acres
,
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
Here
again
,
although
I
went
down
with
the
owner
of
the
estate
,
to
"
the
quarter
,
"
as
that
part
of
it
in
which
the
slaves
live
is
called
,
I
was
not
invited
to
enter
into
any
of
their
huts
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
saw
of
them
,
was
,
that
they
were
very
crazy
,
wretched
cabins
,
near
to
which
groups
of
half
-
naked
children
basked
in
the
sun
,
or
wallowed
on
the
dusty
ground
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
believe
that
this
gentleman
is
a
considerate
and
excellent
master
,
who
inherited
his
fifty
slaves
,
and
is
neither
a
buyer
nor
a
seller
of
human
stock
;
and
I
am
sure
,
from
my
own
observation
and
conviction
,
that
he
is
a
kind
-
hearted
,
worthy
man
.
   
<EOS>
The
planter
's
house
was
an
airy
,
rustic
dwelling
,
that
brought
Defoe
's
description
of
such
places
strongly
to
my
recollection
.
<EOS>
The
day
was
very
warm
,
but
the
blinds
being
all
closed
,
and
the
windows
and
doors
set
wide
open
,
a
shady
coolness
rustled
through
the
rooms
,
which
was
exquisitely
refreshing
after
the
glare
and
heat
without
.
 
<EOS>
Before
the
windows
was
an
open
piazza
,
where
,
in
what
they
call
the
hot
weather
---
whatever
that
may
be
---
they
sling
hammocks
,
and
drink
and
doze
luxuriously
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
their
cool
rejections
may
taste
within
the
hammocks
,
but
,
having
experience
,
I
can
report
that
,
out
of
them
,
the
mounds
of
ices
and
the
bowls
of
mint
-
julep
and
sherry
-
cobbler
they
make
in
these
latitudes
,
are
refreshments
never
to
be
thought
of
afterwards
,
in
summer
,
by
those
who
would
preserve
contented
minds
.
   
<EOS>
There
are
two
bridges
across
the
river
:
 
one
belongs
to
the
railroad
,
and
the
other
,
which
is
a
very
crazy
affair
,
is
the
private
property
of
some
old
lady
in
the
neighbourhood
,
who
levies
tolls
upon
the
townspeople
.
 
<EOS>
Crossing
this
bridge
,
<EOS>
on
my
way
back
,
I
saw
a
notice
painted
on
the
gate
,
cautioning
all
persons
to
drive
slowly
:
 
under
a
penalty
,
if
the
offender
were
a
white
man
,
of
five
dollars
;
if
a
negro
,
fifteen
stripes
.
   
<EOS>
The
same
decay
and
gloom
that
overhang
the
way
by
which
it
is
approached
,
hover
above
the
town
of
Richmond
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
pretty
villas
and
cheerful
houses
in
its
streets
,
and
Nature
smiles
upon
the
country
round
;
but
jostling
its
handsome
residences
,
like
slavery
itself
going
hand
in
hand
with
many
lofty
virtues
,
are
deplorable
tenements
,
fences
unrepaired
,
walls
crumbling
into
ruinous
heaps
.
 
<EOS>
Hinting
gloomily
at
things
below
the
surface
,
these
,
and
many
other
tokens
of
the
same
description
,
force
themselves
upon
the
notice
,
and
are
remembered
with
depressing
influence
,
when
livelier
features
are
forgotten
.
   
<EOS>
To
those
who
are
happily
unaccustomed
to
them
,
the
countenances
in
the
streets
and
labouring
-
places
,
too
,
are
shocking
.
 
<EOS>
All
men
who
know
that
there
are
laws
against
instructing
slaves
,
of
which
the
pains
and
penalties
greatly
exceed
in
their
amount
the
fines
imposed
on
those
who
maim
and
torture
them
,
must
be
prepared
to
find
their
faces
very
low
in
the
scale
of
intellectual
expression
.
<EOS>
But
the
darkness
---
not
of
skin
,
but
mind
---
which
meets
the
stranger
's
eye
at
every
turn
;
the
brutalizing
and
blotting
out
of
all
fairer
characters
traced
by
Nature
's
hand
;
immeasurably
outdo
his
worst
belief
.
 
<EOS>
That
travelled
creation
of
the
great
satirist
's
brain
,
who
fresh
from
living
among
horses
,
peered
from
a
high
casement
down
upon
his
own
kind
with
trembling
horror
,
was
scarcely
more
repelled
and
daunted
by
the
sight
,
than
<EOS>
those
who
look
upon
some
of
these
faces
for
the
first
time
must
surely
be
.
   
<EOS>
I
left
the
last
of
them
behind
me
in
the
person
of
a
wretched
drudge
,
who
,
after
running
to
and
fro
all
day
till
midnight
,
and
moping
in
his
stealthy
winks
of
sleep
upon
the
stairs
betweenwhiles
,
was
washing
the
dark
passages
at
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
;
and
went
upon
my
way
with
a
grateful
heart
that
I
was
not
doomed
to
live
where
slavery
was
,
and
had
never
had
my
senses
blunted
to
its
wrongs
and
horrors
in
a
slave
-
rocked
cradle
.
   
<EOS>
It
had
been
my
intention
to
proceed
by
James
River
and
Chesapeake
Bay
to
Baltimore
;
but
one
of
the
steamboats
being
absent
from
her
station
through
some
accident
,
and
the
means
of
conveyance
being
consequently
rendered
uncertain
<EOS>
,
we
returned
to
Washington
by
the
way
we
had
come
(
there
were
two
constables
on
board
the
steamboat
,
in
pursuit
of
runaway
slaves
)
,
and
halting
there
again
for
one
night
,
went
on
to
Baltimore
next
afternoon
.
   
<EOS>
The
most
comfortable
of
all
the
hotels
of
which
I
had
any
experience
in
the
United
States
,
and
they
were
not
a
few
,
is
Barnum
's
,
in
that
city
:
 
where
the
English
traveller
will
find
curtains
to
his
bed
,
for
the
first
and
probably
the
last
time
in
America
(
this
is
a
disinterested
remark
,
for
I
never
use
them
)
;
and
where
he
will
be
likely
to
have
enough
water
for
washing
himself
,
which
is
not
at
all
a
common
case
.
   
<EOS>
This
capital
of
the
state
of
Maryland
is
a
bustling
,
busy
town
,
with
a
great
deal
of
traffic
of
various
kinds
,
and
in
particular
of
water
commerce
.
 
<EOS>
That
portion
of
the
town
which
it
most
favours
is
none
of
the
cleanest
,
it
is
true
;
but
the
upper
part
is
of
a
very
different
character
,
and
has
many
agreeable
streets
and
public
buildings
.
 
<EOS>
The
Washington
Monument
,
which
is
a
handsome
pillar
with
a
statue
on
its
summit
;
the
Medical
College
;
and
the
Battle
Monument
in
memory
of
an
engagement
with
the
British
at
North
Point
;
are
the
most
conspicuous
among
them
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
a
very
good
prison
in
this
city
,
and
the
State
Penitentiary
is
also
among
its
institutions
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
latter
establishment
there
were
two
curious
cases
.
   
<EOS>
One
was
that
of
a
young
man
,
who
had
been
tried
for
the
murder
of
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
The
evidence
was
entirely
circumstantial
,
and
was
very
conflicting
and
doubtful
;
nor
was
it
possible
to
assign
any
motive
which
could
have
tempted
him
to
the
commission
of
so
tremendous
a
crime
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
tried
twice
;
and
on
the
second
occasion
the
jury
felt
so
much
hesitation
in
convicting
him
,
that
they
found
a
verdict
of
manslaughter
,
or
murder
in
the
second
degree
;
which
it
could
not
possibly
be
,
as
there
had
,
beyond
all
doubt
,
been
no
quarrel
or
provocation
,
and
if
he
were
guilty
at
all
,
he
was
unquestionably
guilty
of
murder
in
its
broadest
and
worst
signification
.
   
<EOS>
The
remarkable
feature
in
the
case
was
,
that
if
the
unfortunate
deceased
were
not
really
murdered
by
this
own
son
of
his
,
he
must
have
been
murdered
by
his
own
brother
.
 
<EOS>
The
evidence
lay
in
a
most
remarkable
manner
,
between
those
two
.
 
<EOS>
On
all
the
suspicious
points
,
the
dead
man
's
brother
was
the
witness
:
 
<EOS>
all
the
explanations
for
the
prisoner
(
some
of
them
extremely
plausible
)
went
,
by
construction
and
inference
,
to
inculcate
him
as
plotting
to
fix
the
guilt
upon
his
nephew
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
have
been
one
of
them
:
and
the
jury
had
to
decide
between
two
sets
of
suspicions
,
almost
equally
unnatural
,
unaccountable
,
and
strange
.
   
<EOS>
The
other
case
,
was
that
of
a
man
who
once
went
to
a
certain
distiller
's
and
stole
a
copper
measure
containing
a
quantity
of
liquor
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
pursued
and
taken
with
the
property
in
his
possession
,
and
was
sentenced
to
two
years
'
imprisonment
.
 
<EOS>
On
coming
out
of
the
jail
,
at
the
expiration
of
that
term
,
he
went
back
to
the
same
distiller
's
,
and
stole
the
same
copper
measure
containing
the
same
quantity
of
liquor
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
not
the
slightest
reason
to
suppose
that
the
man
wished
to
return
to
prison
:
 
indeed
everything
,
but
the
commission
of
the
offence
,
made
directly
against
that
assumption
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
only
two
ways
of
accounting
for
this
extraordinary
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
One
is
,
that
after
undergoing
so
much
for
this
copper
measure
he
conceived
he
had
established
a
sort
of
claim
and
right
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
that
,
by
dint
of
long
thinking
about
,
it
had
become
a
monomania
with
him
,
and
had
acquired
a
fascination
which
he
found
it
impossible
to
resist
;
swelling
from
an
Earthly
Copper
Gallon
into
an
Ethereal
Golden
Vat
.
   
<EOS>
After
remaining
here
a
couple
of
days
I
bound
myself
to
a
rigid
adherence
to
the
plan
I
had
laid
down
so
recently
,
and
resolved
to
set
forward
on
our
western
journey
without
any
more
delay
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
having
reduced
the
luggage
within
the
smallest
possible
compass
(
by
sending
back
to
New
York
,
to
be
afterwards
forwarded
to
us
in
Canada
,
so
much
of
it
as
was
not
absolutely
wanted
)
;
and
having
procured
the
necessary
credentials
to
banking
-
houses
on
the
way
;
and
having
moreover
looked
for
two
evenings
at
the
setting
sun
,
with
as
well
-
defined
an
idea
of
the
country
before
us
as
if
we
had
been
going
to
travel
into
the
very
centre
of
that
planet
;
we
left
Baltimore
by
another
railway
at
half
-
past
eight
in
the
morning
,
and
reached
the
town
of
York
,
some
sixty
miles
off
,
by
the
early
dinner
-
time
of
the
Hotel
which
was
the
starting
-
place
of
the
four
-
horse
coach
,
wherein
we
were
to
proceed
to
Harrisburg
.
   
<EOS>
This
conveyance
,
the
box
of
which
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
secure
,
had
come
down
to
meet
us
at
the
railroad
station
,
and
was
as
muddy
and
cumbersome
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
As
more
passengers
were
waiting
for
us
at
the
inn
-
door
,
the
coachman
observed
under
his
breath
,
in
the
usual
self
-
communicative
voice
,
looking
the
while
at
his
mouldy
harness
as
if
it
were
to
that
he
was
addressing
himself
,
   
<EOS>
"
I
expect
we
shall
want
THE
BIG
coach
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
wondering
within
myself
what
the
size
of
this
big
coach
might
be
,
and
how
many
persons
it
might
be
designed
to
hold
;
for
the
vehicle
which
was
too
small
for
our
purpose
was
something
larger
than
two
English
heavy
night
coaches
,
and
might
have
been
the
twin
-
brother
of
a
French
Diligence
.
 
<EOS>
My
speculations
were
speedily
set
at
rest
,
however
,
for
as
soon
as
we
had
dined
,
there
came
rumbling
up
the
street
,
shaking
its
sides
like
a
corpulent
giant
,
a
kind
of
barge
on
wheels
.
 
<EOS>
After
much
blundering
and
backing
,
it
stopped
at
the
door
:
 
rolling
heavily
from
side
to
side
when
its
other
motion
had
ceased
,
as
if
it
had
taken
cold
in
its
damp
stable
,
and
between
that
,
and
the
having
been
required
in
its
dropsical
old
age
to
move
at
any
faster
pace
than
a
walk
,
were
distressed
by
shortness
of
wind
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
here
ai
n't
the
Harrisburg
mail
at
last
,
and
dreadful
bright
and
smart
to
look
at
too
,
"
cried
an
elderly
gentleman
in
some
excitement
,
"
darn
my
mother
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
the
sensation
of
being
darned
may
be
,
or
whether
a
man
's
mother
has
a
keener
relish
or
disrelish
of
the
process
than
anybody
else
;
but
if
the
endurance
of
this
mysterious
ceremony
by
the
old
lady
in
question
had
depended
on
the
accuracy
of
her
son
's
vision
in
respect
to
the
abstract
brightness
and
smartness
of
the
Harrisburg
mail
,
she
would
certainly
have
undergone
its
infliction
.
<EOS>
However
,
they
booked
twelve
people
inside
;
and
the
luggage
(
including
such
trifles
as
a
large
rocking
-
chair
,
and
a
good
-
sized
dining
-
table
)
being
at
length
made
fast
upon
the
roof
,
we
started
off
in
great
state
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
door
of
another
hotel
,
there
was
another
passenger
to
be
taken
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Any
room
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
cries
the
new
passenger
to
the
coachman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
there
's
room
enough
,
"
replies
the
coachman
,
without
getting
down
,
or
even
looking
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
an't
no
room
at
all
,
sir
,
"
bawls
a
gentleman
inside
.
 
<EOS>
Which
another
gentleman
(
also
inside
)
confirms
,
by
predicting
that
the
attempt
to
introduce
any
more
passengers
"
wo
n't
fit
nohow
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
new
passenger
,
without
any
expression
of
anxiety
,
looks
into
the
coach
,
and
then
looks
up
at
the
coachman
:
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
how
do
you
mean
to
fix
it
?
<EOS>
"
says
he
,
after
a
pause
:
 
"
for
I
MUST
go
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
coachman
employs
himself
in
twisting
the
lash
of
his
whip
into
a
knot
,
and
takes
no
more
notice
of
the
question
:
 
clearly
signifying
that
it
is
anybody
's
business
but
his
,
and
that
the
passengers
would
do
well
to
fix
it
,
among
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
state
of
things
,
matters
seem
to
be
approximating
to
a
fix
of
another
kind
,
when
another
inside
passenger
in
a
corner
,
who
is
nearly
suffocated
,
cries
faintly
,
"
I
'll
get
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
is
no
matter
of
relief
or
self
-
congratulation
to
the
driver
,
for
his
immovable
philosophy
is
perfectly
undisturbed
by
anything
that
happens
in
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
Of
all
things
in
the
world
,
the
coach
would
seem
to
be
the
very
last
upon
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
The
exchange
is
made
,
however
,
and
then
the
passenger
who
has
given
up
his
seat
makes
a
third
upon
the
box
,
seating
himself
in
what
he
calls
the
middle
;
that
is
,
with
half
his
person
on
my
legs
,
and
the
other
half
on
the
driver
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go

cries
the
colonel
,
who

<EOS>
"
Go
-
lang
!
<EOS>
"
cries
the
cap'en
to
his
company
,
the
horses
,
and
away
we
go
.
   
<EOS>
We
took
up
at
a
rural
bar
-
room
,
after
we
had
gone
a
few
miles
,
an
intoxicated
gentleman
who
climbed
upon
the
roof
among
the
luggage
,
and
subsequently
slipping
off
without
hurting
himself
,
was
seen
in
the
distant
perspective
reeling
back
to
the
grog
-
shop
where
we
had
found
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
also
parted
with
more
of
our
freight
at
different
times
,
so
that
when
we
came
to
change
horses
,
I
was
again
alone
outside
.
   
<EOS>
The
coachmen
always
change
with
the
horses
,
and
are
usually
as
dirty
as
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
was
dressed
like
a
very
shabby
English
baker
;
the
second
like
a
Russian
peasant
:
 
for
he
wore
a
loose
purple
camlet
robe
,
with
a
fur
collar
,
tied
round
his
waist
with
a
parti
-
coloured
worsted
sash
;
grey
trousers
;
light
blue
gloves
:
 
and
a
cap
of
bearskin
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
by
this
time
come
on
to
rain
very
heavily
,
and
there
was
a
cold
damp
mist
besides
,
which
penetrated
to
the
skin
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
glad
to
take
advantage
of
a
stoppage
and
get
down
to
stretch
my
legs
,
shake
the
water
off
my
great
-
coat
,
and
swallow
the
usual
anti
-
temperance
recipe
for
keeping
out
the
cold
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
mounted
to
my
seat
again
,
I
observed
a
new
parcel
lying
on
the
coach
roof
,
which
I
took
to
be
a
rather
large
fiddle
in
a
brown
bag
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
a
few
miles
,
however
,
I
discovered
that
it
had
a
glazed
cap
at
one
end
and
a
pair
of
muddy
shoes
at
the
other
and
further
observation
demonstrated
it
to
be
a
small
boy
in
a
snuff
-
coloured
coat
,
with
his
arms
quite
pinioned
to
his
sides
,
by
deep
forcing
into
his
pockets
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
,
I
presume
,
a
relative
or
friend
of
the
coachman
's
,
as
he
lay
a
-
top
of
the
luggage
with
his
face
towards
the
rain
;
and
except
when
a
change
of
position
brought
his
shoes
in
contact
with
my
hat
,
he
appeared
to
be
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
on
some
occasion
of
our
stopping
,
this
thing
slowly
upreared
itself
to
the
height
of
three
feet
six
,
and
fixing
its
eyes
on
me
,
observed
in
piping
accents
,
with
a
complaisant
yawn
,
half
quenched
in
an
obliging
air
of
friendly
patronage
,
"
<EOS>
Well
now
,
stranger
,
I
guess
you
find
this
a'most
like
an
English
arternoon
,
hey
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
scenery
,
which
had
been
tame
enough
at
first
,
was
,
for
the
last
ten
or
twelve
miles
,
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
Our
road
wound
through
the
pleasant
valley
of
the
Susquehanna
;
the
river
,
dotted
with
innumerable
green
islands
,
lay
upon
our
right
;
and
on
the
left
,
a
steep
ascent
,
craggy
with
broken
rock
,
and
dark
with
pine
trees
.
<EOS>
The
mist
,
wreathing
itself
into
a
hundred
fantastic
shapes
,
moved
solemnly
upon
the
water
;
and
the
gloom
of
evening
gave
to
all
an
air
of
mystery
and
silence
which
greatly
enhanced
its
natural
interest
.
   
<EOS>
We
crossed
this
river
by
a
wooden
bridge
,
roofed
and
covered
in
on
all
sides
,
and
nearly
a
mile
in
length
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
profoundly
dark
;
perplexed
,
with
great
beams
,
crossing
and
recrossing
it
at
every
possible
angle
;
and
through
the
broad
chinks
and
crevices
in
the
floor
,
the
rapid
river
gleamed
,
far
down
below
,
like
a
legion
of
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
no
lamps
;
and
as
the
horses
stumbled
and
floundered
through
this
place
,
towards
the
distant
speck
of
dying
light
,
it
seemed
interminable
.
 
<EOS>
I
really
could
not
at
first
persuade
myself
as
we
rumbled
heavily
on
,
filling
the
bridge
with
hollow
noises
,
and
I
held
down
my
head
to
save
it
from
the
rafters
above
,
but
that
I
was
in
a
painful
dream
;
for
I
have
often
dreamed
of
toiling
through
such
places
,
and
as
often
argued
,
even
at
the
time
,
"
this
can
not
be
reality
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
we
emerged
upon
the
streets
of
Harrisburg
,
whose
feeble
lights
,
reflected
dismally
from
the
wet
ground
,
did
not
shine
out
upon
a
very
cheerful
city
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
soon
established
in
a
snug
hotel
,
which
though
smaller
and
far
less
splendid
than
many
we
put
up
at
,
it
raised
above
them
all
in
my
remembrance
,
by
having
for
its
landlord
the
most
obliging
,
considerate
,
and
gentlemanly
person
I
ever
had
to
deal
with
.
   
<EOS>
As
we
were
not
to
proceed
upon
our
journey
until
the
afternoon
,
I
walked
out
,
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
,
to
look
about
me
;
and
was
duly
shown
a
model
prison
on
the
solitary
system
,
just
erected
,
and
as
yet
without
an
inmate
;
the
trunk
of
an
old
tree
to
which
Harris
,
the
first
settler
here
(
afterwards
buried
under
it
)
,
was
tied
by
hostile
Indians
,
with
his
funeral
pile
about
him
,
when
he
was
saved
by
the
timely
appearance
of
a
friendly
party
on
the
opposite
shore
of
the
river
;
the
local
legislature
(
for
there
was
another
of
those
bodies
here
again
,
in
full
debate
)
;
and
the
other
curiosities
of
the
town
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
very
much
interested
in
looking
over
a
number
of
treaties
made
from
time
to
time
with
the
poor
Indians
,
signed
by
the
different
chiefs
at
the
period
of
their
ratification
,
and
preserved
in
the
office
of
the
Secretary
to
the
Commonwealth
.
 
<EOS>
These
signatures
,
traced
of
course
by
their
own
hands
,
are
rough
drawings
of
the
creatures
or
weapons
they
were
called
after
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
the
Great
Turtle
makes
a
crooked
pen
-
and
-
ink
outline
of
a
great
turtle
;
the
Buffalo
sketches
a
buffalo
;
the
War
Hatchet
sets
a
rough
image
of
that
weapon
for
his
mark
.
 
<EOS>
So
with
the
Arrow
,
the
Fish
,
the
Scalp
,
the
Big
Canoe
,
and
all
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
think
---
as
I
looked
at
these
feeble
and
tremulous
productions
of
hands
which
could
draw
the
longest
arrow
to
the
head
in
a
stout
elk
-
horn
bow
,
or
split
a
bead
or
feather
with
a
rifle
-
ball
 
---
of
Crabbe
's
musings
over
the
Parish
Register
,
and
the
irregular
scratches
made
with
a
pen
,
by
men
who
would
plough
a
lengthy
furrow
straight
from
end
to
end
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
could
I
help
bestowing
many
sorrowful
thoughts
upon
the
simple
warriors
whose
hands
and
hearts
were
set
there
,
in
all
truth
and
honesty
;
and
who
only
learned
in
course
of
time
from
white
men
how
to
break
their
faith
,
and
quibble
out
of
forms
and
bonds
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
,
too
,
how
many
times
the
credulous
Big
Turtle
,
or
trusting
Little
Hatchet
,
had
put
his
mark
to
treaties
which
were
falsely
read
to
him
;
and
had
signed
away
,
he
knew
not
what
,
until
it
went
and
cast
him
loose
upon
the
new
possessors
of
the
land
,
a
savage
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
Our
host
announced
,
before
our
early
dinner
,
that
some
members
of
the
legislative
body
proposed
to
do
us
the
honour
of
calling
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
kindly
yielded
up
to
us
his
wife
's
own
little
parlour
,
and
when
I
begged
that
he
would
show
them
in
,
I
saw
him
look
with
painful
apprehension
at
its
pretty
carpet
;
though
,
being
otherwise
occupied
at
the
time
,
the
cause
of
his
uneasiness
did
not
occur
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
It
certainly
would
have
been
more
pleasant
to
all
parties
concerned
,
and
would
not
,
I
think
,
have
compromised
their
independence
in
any
material
degree
,
if
some
of
these
gentlemen
had
not
only
yielded
to
the
prejudice
in
favour
of
spittoons
,
but
had
abandoned
themselves
,
for
the
moment
,
even
to
the
conventional
absurdity
of
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
.
   
<EOS>
It
still
continued
to
rain
heavily
,
and
when
we
went
down
to
the
Canal
Boat
<EOS>
(
for
that
was
the
mode
of
conveyance
by
which
we
were
to
proceed
)
after
dinner
,
the
weather
was
as
unpromising
and
obstinately
wet
as
one
would
desire
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
the
sight
of
this
canal
boat
,
in
which
we
were
to
spend
three
or
four
days
,
by
any
means
a
cheerful
one
;
as
it
involved
some
uneasy
speculations
concerning
the
disposal
of
the
passengers
at
night
,
and
opened
a
wide
field
of
inquiry
touching
the
other
domestic
arrangements
of
the
establishment
,
which
was
sufficiently
disconcerting
.
   
<EOS>
However
,
there
it
was
---
a
barge
with
a
little
house
in
it
,
viewed
from
the
outside
;
and
a
caravan
at
a
fair
,
viewed
from
within
:
 
the
gentlemen
being
accommodated
,
as
the
spectators
usually
are
,
in
one
of
those
locomotive
museums
of
penny
wonders
;
and
the
ladies
being
partitioned
off
by
a
red
curtain
,
after
the
manner
of
the
dwarfs
and
giants
in
the
same
establishments
,
whose
private
lives
are
passed
in
rather
close
exclusiveness
.
   
<EOS>
We
sat
here
,
looking
silently
at
the
row
of
little
tables
,
which
extended
down
both
sides
of
the
cabin
,
and
listening
to
the
rain
as
it
dripped
and
pattered
on
the
boat
,
and
plashed
with
a
dismal
merriment
in
the
water
,
until
the
arrival
of
the
railway
train
,
for
whose
final
contribution
to
our
stock
of
passengers
,
our
departure
was
alone
deferred
.
 
<EOS>
It
brought
a
great
many
boxes
,
which
were
bumped
and
tossed
upon
the
roof
,
almost
as
painfully
as
if
they
had
been
deposited
on
one
's
own
head
,
without
the
intervention
of
a
porter
's
knot
;
and
several
damp
gentlemen
,
whose
clothes
,
on
their
drawing
round
the
stove
,
began
to
steam
again
.
 
<EOS>
No
doubt
it
would
have
been
a
thought
more
comfortable
if
the
driving
rain
,
which
now
poured
down
more
soakingly
than
ever
,
had
admitted
of
a
window
being
opened
,
or
if
our
number
had
been
something
less
than
thirty
;
but
there
was
scarcely
time
to
think
as
much
,
when
a
train
of
three
horses
was
attached
to
the
tow
-
rope
,
the
boy
upon
the
leader
smacked
his
whip
,
the
rudder
creaked
and
groaned
complainingly
,
and
we
had
begun
our
journey
.

AS
<EOS>
it
continued
to
rain
most
perseveringly
,
we
all
remained
below
:
the
damp
gentlemen
round
the
stove
,
gradually
becoming
mildewed
by
the
action
of
the
fire
;
and
the
dry
gentlemen
lying
at
full
length
upon
the
seats
,
or
slumbering
uneasily
with
their
faces
on
the
tables
,
or
walking
up
and
down
the
cabin
,
which
it
was
barely
possible
for
a
man
of
the
middle
height
to
do
,
without
making
bald
places
on
his
head
by
scraping
it
against
the
roof
.
 
<EOS>
At
about
six
o'clock
,
all
the
small
tables
were
put
together
to
form
one
long
table
,
and
everybody
sat
down
to

coffee

"

"
said
my
opposite
neighbour
,
handing
me
a
dish
of
potatoes
,
broken
up
in
milk
and
butter
,
"
will
you

<EOS>
There
are

words
which
perform
such
various

as
this
word
"
fix

"
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
Caleb
Quotem
of
the
American
vocabulary
.
 
<EOS>
You
call
upon
a
gentleman
in
a
country
town
,
and
his
help
informs
you
that
he
is
"
fixing
himself
"
just
now
,
but
will
be
down
directly
:
by
which
you
are
to
understand
that
he
is
dressing
.
 
<EOS>
You
inquire
,
on
board
a
steamboat
,
of
a
fellow
-
passenger
<EOS>
,
whether
breakfast
will
be
ready
soon
,
and
he
tells
you
he
should
think
so
,
for
when
he
was
last
below
,
they
were
"
fixing
the
tables
:
"
in
other
words
,
laying
the
cloth
.
 
<EOS>
You
beg
a
porter
to
collect
your
luggage
,
and
he
entreats
you
not
to
be
uneasy
,
for
he
'll
"
fix
it
presently
:
<EOS>
"
and
if
you
complain
of
indisposition
,
you
are
advised
to
have
recourse
to
Doctor

So

in

One
night
,
I
ordered
a
bottle
of
mulled
wine
at
an
hotel
where
I
was
staying
,
and
waited
a
long
time
for
it
;
at
length
it
was
put
upon
the
table
with
an
apology
from
the
landlord
that
he
feared
it
was
n't
"
fixed
properly
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
recollect
once
,
at
a
stage
-
coach
dinner
,
overhearing
a
very
stern
gentleman
demand
of
a
waiter
who
presented
him
with
a
plate
of
underdone
roast
-
beef
,
"
whether
he
called
THAT
,
fixing
God
A'mighty
's
vittles
?
"
   
<EOS>
There
is
no
doubt
that
the
meal
,
at
which
the
invitation
was
tendered
to
me
which
has
occasioned
this
digression
,
was
disposed
of
somewhat
ravenously
;
and
that
the
gentlemen
thrust
the
broad
-
bladed
knives
and
the
two
-
pronged
forks
further
down
their
throats
than
I
ever
saw
the
same
weapons
go
before
,
except
in
the
hands
of
a
skilful
juggler
:
 
but
no
man
sat
down
until
the
ladies
were
seated
;
or
omitted
any
little
act
of
politeness
which
could
contribute
to
their
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
did
I
ever
once
,
on
any
occasion
,
anywhere
,
during
my
rambles
in
America
,
see
a
woman
exposed
to
the
slightest
act
of
rudeness
,
incivility
,
or
even
inattention
.
   
<EOS>
By
the
time
the
meal
was
over
,
the
rain
,
which
seemed
to
have
worn
itself
out
by
coming
down
so
fast
,
was
nearly
over
too
;
and
it
became
feasible
to
go
on
deck
:
 
which
was
a
great
relief
,
notwithstanding
its
being
a
very
small
deck
,
and
being
rendered
still
smaller
by
the
luggage
,
which
was
heaped
together
in
the
middle
under
a
tarpaulin
covering
;
leaving
,
on
either
side
,
a
path
so
narrow
,
that
it
became
a
science
to
walk
to
and
fro
without
tumbling
overboard
into
the
canal
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
somewhat
embarrassing
at
first
,
too
,
to
have
to
duck
nimbly
every
five
minutes
whenever
the
man
at
the
helm
cried
"
Bridge
!
"
<EOS>
and
sometimes
,
when
the
cry
was
"
Low
Bridge
,
"
to
lie
down
nearly
flat
.
 
<EOS>
But
custom
familiarises
one
to
anything
,
and
there
were
so
many
bridges
that
it
took
a
very
short
time
to
get
used
to
this
.
   
<EOS>
As
night
came
on
,
and
we
drew
in
sight
of
the
first
range
of
hills
,
which
are
the
outposts
of
the
Alleghany
Mountains
,
the
scenery
,
which
had
been
uninteresting
hitherto
,
became
more
bold
and
striking
.
 
<EOS>
The
wet
ground
reeked
and
smoked
,
after
the
heavy
fall
of
rain
,
and
the
croaking
of
the
frogs
(
whose
noise
in
these
parts
is
almost
incredible
)
sounded
as
though
a
million
of
fairy
teams
with
bells
were
travelling
through
the
air
,
and
keeping
pace
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
was
cloudy
yet
,
but
moonlight
too
:
 
and
when
we
crossed
the
Susquehanna
river
---
over
which
there
is
an
extraordinary
wooden
bridge
with
two
galleries
,
one
above
the
other
,
so
that
even
there
,
two
boat
teams
meeting
,
may
pass
without
confusion
---
it
was
wild
and
grand
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
mentioned
my
having
been
in
some
uncertainty
and
doubt
,
at
first
,
relative
to
the
sleeping
arrangements
on
board
this
boat
.
 
<EOS>
I
remained
in
the
same
vague
state
of
mind
until
ten
o'clock
or
thereabouts
,
<EOS>
when
going
below
,
I
found
suspended
on
either
side
of
the
cabin
,
three
long
tiers
of
hanging
bookshelves
,
designed
apparently
for
volumes
of
the
small
octavo
size
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
with
greater
attention
at
these
contrivances
(
wondering
to
find
such
literary
preparations
in
such
a
place
)
,
I
descried
on
each
shelf
a
sort
of
microscopic
sheet
and
blanket
;
then
I
began
dimly
to
comprehend
that
the
passengers
were
the
library
,
and
that
they
were
to
be
arranged
,
edge
-
wise
,
on
these
shelves
,
till
morning
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
assisted
to
this
conclusion
by
seeing
some
of
them
gathered
round
<EOS>
the
master
of
the
boat
,
at
one
of
the
tables
,
drawing
lots
with
all
the
anxieties
and
passions
of
gamesters
depicted
in
their
countenances
<EOS>
;
while
others
,
with
small
pieces
of
cardboard
in
their
hands
,
were
groping
among
the
shelves
in
search
of
numbers
corresponding
with
those
they
had
drawn
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
any
gentleman
found
his
number
,
he
took
possession
of
it
by
immediately
undressing
himself
and
crawling
into
bed
.
 
<EOS>
The
rapidity
with
which
an
agitated
gambler
subsided
into
a
snoring
slumberer
,
was
one
of
the
most
singular
effects
I
have
ever
witnessed
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
ladies
,
they
were
already
abed
,
behind
the
red
curtain
,
which
was
carefully
drawn
and
pinned
up
the
centre
;
though
as
every
cough
,
or
sneeze
,
or
whisper
,
behind
this
curtain
,
was
perfectly
audible
before
it
,
we
had
still
a
lively
consciousness
of
their
society
.
   
<EOS>
The
politeness
of
the
person
in
authority
had
secured
to
me
a
shelf
in
a
nook
near
this
red
curtain
,
in
some
degree
removed
from
the
great
body
of
sleepers
:
 
to
which
place
I
retired
,
with
many
acknowledgments
to
him
for
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
it
,
on
after
-
measurement
,
just
the
width
of
an
ordinary
sheet
of
Bath
post
letter
-
paper
;
and
I
was
at
first
in
some
uncertainty
as
to
the
best
means
of
getting
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
shelf
being
a
bottom
one
<EOS>
,
I
finally
determined
on
lying
upon
the
floor
,
rolling
gently
in
,
stopping
immediately
<EOS>
I
touched
the
mattress
,
and
remaining
for
the
night
with
that
side
uppermost
,
whatever
it
might
be
.
 
<EOS>
Luckily
,
I
came
upon
my
back
at
exactly
the
right
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
much
alarmed
on
looking
upward
,
to
see
,
by
the
shape
of
his
half
-
yard
of
sacking
(
which
his
weight
had
bent
into
an
exceedingly
tight
bag
)
<EOS>
,
that
there
was
a
very
heavy
gentleman
above
me
,
whom
the
slender
cords
seemed
quite
incapable
of
holding
;
and
I
could
not
help
reflecting
upon
the
grief
of
my
wife
and
family
in
the
event
of
his
coming
down
in
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
I
could
not
have
got
up
again
without
a
severe
bodily
struggle
,
which
might
have
alarmed
the
ladies
;
and
as
I
had
nowhere
to
go
to
,
even
if
I
had
;
I
shut
my
eyes
upon
the
danger
,
and
remained
there
.
   
<EOS>
One
of
two
remarkable
circumstances
is
indisputably
a
fact
,
with
reference
to
that
class
of
society
who
travel
in
these
boats
.
<EOS>
Either
they
carry
their
restlessness
to
such
a
pitch
that
they
never
sleep
at
all
;
or
they
expectorate
in
dreams
,
which
would
be
a
remarkable
mingling
of
the
real
and
ideal
.
 
<EOS>
All
night
long
,
and
every
night
,
on
this
canal
,
there
was
a
perfect
storm
and
tempest
of
spitting
;
and
once
my
coat
,
being
in
the
very
centre
of
the
hurricane
sustained
by
five
gentlemen
(
which
moved
vertically
,
strictly
carrying
out
Reid
's
Theory
of
the
Law
of
Storms
)
<EOS>
,
I
was
fain
the
next
morning
to
lay
it
on
the
deck
,
and
rub
it
down
with
fair
water
before
it
was
in
a
condition
to
be
worn
again
.
   
<EOS>
Between
five
and
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
we
got
up
,
and
some
of
us
went
on
deck
,
to
give
them
an
opportunity
of
taking
the
shelves
down
;
while
others
,
the
morning
being
very
cold
,
crowded
round
the
rusty
stove
,
cherishing
the
newly
kindled
fire
,
and
filling
the
grate
with
those
voluntary
contributions
of
which
they
had
been
so
liberal
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
washing
accommodations
were
primitive
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
tin
ladle
chained
to
the
deck
,
with
which
every
gentleman
who
thought
it
necessary
to
cleanse
himself
(
many
were
superior
to
this
weakness
)
,
fished
the
dirty
water
out
of
the
canal
,
and
poured
it
into
a
tin
basin
,
secured
in
like
manner
.
<EOS>
There
was
also
a
jack
-
towel
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
hanging
up
before
a
little
looking
-
glass
in
the
bar
,
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
bread
and
cheese
and
biscuits
,
were
a
public
comb
and
hair
-
brush
.
   
<EOS>
At
eight
o'clock
,
the
shelves
being
taken
down
and
put
away
and
the
tables
joined
together
,
everybody
sat
down
to
the
tea
,
coffee
,
bread
,
butter
,
salmon
,
shad
,
liver
,
steak
,
potatoes
,
pickles
,
ham
,
chops
,
black
-
puddings
,
and
sausages
,
all
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
Some
were
fond
of
compounding
this
variety
,
and
having
it
all
on
their
plates
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
As
each
gentleman
got
through
his
own
personal
amount
of
tea
,
coffee
,
bread
,
butter
,
salmon
,
shad
,
liver
,
steak
,
potatoes
,
pickles
,
ham
,
chops
,
black
-
puddings
,
and
sausages
,
he
rose
up
and
walked
off
.
 
<EOS>
When
everybody
had
done
with
everything
,
the
fragments
were
cleared
away
:
 
and
one
of
the
waiters
appearing
anew
in
the
character
of
a
barber
,
shaved
such
of
the
company
as
desired
to
be
shaved
;
while
the
remainder
looked
on
,
or
yawned
over
their
newspapers
.
 
<EOS>
Dinner
was
breakfast
again
,
without
the
tea
and
coffee
;
and
supper
and
breakfast
were
identical
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
man
on
board
this
boat
,
with
a
light
fresh
-
coloured
face
,
and
a
pepper
-
and
-
salt
suit
of
clothes
,
who
was
the
most
inquisitive
fellow
that
can
possibly
be
imagined
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
spoke
otherwise
than
interrogatively
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
an
embodied
inquiry
.
<EOS>
Sitting
down
or
standing
up
,
still
or
moving
,
walking
the
deck
or
taking
his
meals
,
there
he
was
,
with
a
great
note
of
interrogation
in
each
eye
,
two
in
his
cocked
ears
,
two
more
in
his
turned
-
up
nose
and
chin
,
at
least
half
a
dozen
more
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
,
and
the
largest
one
of
all
in
his
hair
,
which
was
brushed
pertly
off
his
forehead
in
a
flaxen
clump
.
 
<EOS>
Every
button
in
his
clothes
said
,
"
Eh
?
 
<EOS>
What
's
that
?
 
<EOS>
Did
you
speak
?
 
<EOS>
Say
that
again
,
will
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
always
wide
awake
,
like
the
enchanted
bride
who
drove
her
husband
frantic
;
always
restless
;
always
thirsting
for
answers
;
perpetually
seeking
and
never
finding
.
 
<EOS>
There
never
was
such
a
curious
man
.
   
<EOS>
I
wore
a
fur
great
-
coat
at
that
time
,
and
before
we
were
well
clear
of
the
wharf
,
he
questioned
me
concerning
it
,
and
its
price
,
and
where
I
bought
it
,
and
when
,
<EOS>
and
what
fur
it
was
,
and
<EOS>
what
it
weighed
,
and
what
it
cost
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
took
notice
of
my
watch
,
and
asked
me
what
THAT
cost
,
and
whether
it
was
a
French
watch
,
and
where
I
got
it
,
and
how
I
got
it
,
and
whether
I
bought
it
or
had
it
given
me
,
and
how
it
went
,
and
where
the
key
-
hole
was
,
and
when
I
wound
it
,
every
night
or
every
morning
,
and
whether
I
ever
forgot
to
wind
it
at
all
,
and
if
I
did
,
<EOS>
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
Where
had
I
been
to
last
,
and
where
was
I
going
next
,
and
where
was
I
going
after
that
,
and
had
I
seen
the
President
,
and
what
did
he
say
,
<EOS>
and
what
did
I
say
,
<EOS>
and
what
did
he
say
when
I
had
said
that
?
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
 
<EOS>
Lor
now
!
<EOS>
do
tell
!
   
<EOS>
Finding
that
nothing
would
satisfy
him
,
I
evaded
his
questions
after
the
first
score
or
two
,
and
in
particular
pleaded
ignorance
respecting
the
name
of
the
fur
<EOS>
whereof
the
coat
was
made
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
unable
to
say
whether
this
was
the
reason
,
but
that
coat
fascinated
him
afterwards
;
he
usually
kept
close
behind
me
as
I
walked
,
and
moved
as
I
moved
,
that
he
might
look
at
it
the
better
;
and
he
frequently
dived
into
narrow
places
after
me
at
the
risk
of
his
life
,
that
he
might
have
the
satisfaction
of
passing
his
hand
up
the
back
,
and
rubbing
it
the
wrong
way
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
another
odd
specimen
on
board
,
of
a
different
kind
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
a
thin
-
faced
,
spare
-
figured
man
of
middle
age
and
stature
,
dressed
in
a
dusty
drabbish
-
coloured
suit
,
such
as
I
never
saw
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
perfectly
quiet
during
the
first
part
of
the
journey
:
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
do
n't
remember
having
so
much
as
seen
him
until
he
was
brought
out
by
circumstances
,
as
great
men
often
are
.
 
<EOS>
The
conjunction
of
events
which
made
him
famous
,
happened
,
briefly
,
thus
.
   
<EOS>
The
canal
extends
to
the
foot
of
the
mountain
,
and
there
,
of
course
,
it
stops
;
the
passengers
being
conveyed
across
it
by
land
carriage
,
and
taken
on
afterwards
by
another
canal
boat
,
the
counterpart
of
the
first
,
which
awaits
them
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
There
are
two
canal
lines
of
passage
-
boats
;
one
is
called
The
Express
,
and
one
(
a
cheaper
one
)
<EOS>
The
Pioneer
.
 
<EOS>
The
Pioneer
gets
first
to
the
mountain
,
and
waits
for
the
Express
people
to
come
up
;
both
sets
of
passengers
being
conveyed
across
it
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
We
were
the
Express
company
;
but
when
we
had
crossed
the
mountain
,
and
had
come
to
the
second
boat
,
the
proprietors
took
it
into
their
beads
to
draft
all
the
Pioneers
into
it
likewise
,
so
that
we
were
five
-
and
-
forty
at
least
,
and
the
accession
of
passengers
was
not
at
all
of
that
kind
which
improved
the
prospect
of
sleeping
at
night
.
<EOS>
Our
people
grumbled
at
this
,
as
people
do
in
such
cases
;
but
suffered
the
boat
to
be
towed
off
with
the
whole
freight
aboard
nevertheless
;
and
away
we
went
down
the
canal
.
 
<EOS>
At
home
,
I
should
have
protested
lustily
,
but
being
a
foreigner
here
,
I
held
my
peace
.
 
<EOS>
Not
so
this
passenger
.
 
<EOS>
He
cleft
a
path
among
the
people
on
deck
(
we
were
nearly
all
on
deck
)
,
and
without
addressing
anybody
whomsoever
,
soliloquised
as
follows
:
   
<EOS>
"
This
may
suit
YOU

this
may

but
it
do

suit
ME

<EOS>
This
may
be
all
very
well
with
Down
Easters
,
and
men
of
Boston
raising
,
but
it
wo
n't
suit
my
figure
nohow
;
and
no
two
ways
about
THAT
;
and
so
I
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
Now
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
from
the
brown
forests
of
Mississippi
,
I
am
,
and
when
the
sun
shines
on
me
,
it
does
shine
---
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
n't
glimmer
where
I
live
,
the
sun
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
brown
forester
,
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
I
an't
<EOS>
a
Johnny
Cake
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
no
smooth
skins
where
I
live
.
<EOS>
We
're
rough
men
there
.
 
<EOS>
Rather
.
 
<EOS>
If
Down
Easters
and
men
of
Boston
raising
like
this
,
I
'm
glad
of
it
,
but
I
'm
none
of
that
raising
nor
of
that
breed
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
This
company
wants
a
little
fixing
,
IT
does
.
<EOS>
I
'm
the
wrong
sort
of
man
for
'em
,
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
They
wo
n't
like
me
,
THEY
wo
n't
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
piling
of
it
up
,
a
little
too
mountainous
,
this
is
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
every
one
of
these
short
sentences
he
turned
upon
his
heel
,
and
walked
the
other
way
;
checking
himself
abruptly
when
he
had
finished
another
short
sentence
,
and
turning
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
what
terrific
meaning
was
hidden
in
the
words
of
this
brown
forester
,
but
I
know
that
the
other
passengers
looked
on
in
a
sort
of
admiring
horror
,
and
that
presently
the
boat
was
put
back
to
the
wharf
,
and
as
many
of
the
Pioneers
as
could
be
coaxed
or
bullied
into
going
away
,
were
got
rid
of
.
   
<EOS>
When
we
started
again
,
some
of
the
boldest
spirits
on
board
,
made
bold
to
say
to
the
obvious
occasion
of
this
improvement
in
our
prospects
,
"
Much
obliged
to
you
,
sir
;
"
whereunto
the
brown
forester
<EOS>
(
waving
his
hand
,
and
still
walking
up
and
down
as
before
)
,
replied
,
"
No
you
an't
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
none
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
my
raising
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
act
for
yourselves
,
YOU
may

<EOS>
I
have
pinted
out
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
Down
Easters
and
Johnny
Cakes
can
follow
if
they
please

<EOS>
I
an't
<EOS>
a

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
I

---
and
so
on
,
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
unanimously
voted
one
of
the
tables
for
his
bed
at
night
---
there
is
a
great
contest
for
the
tables
---
in
consideration
for
his
public
services
:
 
and
he
had
the
warmest
corner
by
the
stove
throughout
the
rest
of
the
journey
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
never
could
find
out
that
he
did
anything
except
sit
there
;
nor
did
I
hear
him
speak
again
until
,
in
the
midst
of
the
bustle
and
turmoil
of
getting
the
luggage
ashore
in
the
dark
at
Pittsburg
,
I
stumbled
over
him
as
he
sat
smoking
a
cigar
on
the
cabin
steps
,
and
heard
him
muttering
to
himself
,
with
a
short
laugh
of
defiance
,
"
I
an't
a
Johnny
Cake
,
---
<EOS>
I
an't
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
from
the
brown
forests
of
the
Mississippi
,
I
am
,
damme
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
am
inclined
to
argue
from
this
,
that
he
had
never
left
off
saying
so
;
but
I
could
not
make
an
affidavit
of
that
part
of
the
story
,
if
required
to
do
so
by
my
Queen
and
Country
.
   
<EOS>
As
we
have
not
reached
Pittsburg
yet
,
however
,
in
the
order
of
our
narrative
,
I
may
go
on
to
remark
that
breakfast
was
perhaps
the
least
desirable
meal
of
the
day
,
as
in
addition
to
the
many
savoury
odours
arising
from
the
eatables
already
mentioned
,
there
were
whiffs
of
gin
,
whiskey
,
brandy
,
and
rum
,
from
the
little
bar
hard
by
,
and
a
decided
seasoning
of
stale
tobacco
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
the
gentlemen
passengers
were
far
from
particular
in
respect
of
their
linen
,
which
was
in
some
cases
as
yellow
as
the
little
rivulets
that
had
trickled
from
the
corners
of
their
mouths
in
chewing
,
and
dried
there
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
the
atmosphere
quite
free
from
zephyr
whisperings
of
the
thirty
beds
which
had
just
been
cleared
away
,
and
of
which
we
were
further
and
more
pressingly
reminded
by
the
occasional
appearance
on
the
table
-
cloth
of
a
kind
of
Game
,
not
mentioned
in
the
Bill
of
Fare
.
   
<EOS>
And
yet
despite
these
oddities
---
and
even
they
had
,
for
me
<EOS>
at
least
,
a
humour
of
their
own
---
there
was
much
in
this
mode
of
travelling
which
I
heartily
enjoyed
at
the
time
,
and
look
back
upon
with
great
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
running
up
,
bare
-
necked
,
at
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
from
the
tainted
cabin
to
the
dirty
deck
;
scooping
up
the
icy
water
,
plunging
one
's
head
into
it
,
and
drawing
it
out
,
all
fresh
and
glowing
with
the
cold
;
was
a
good
thing
.
 
<EOS>
The
fast
,
brisk
walk
upon
the
towing
-
path
,
between
that
time
and
breakfast
,
when
every
vein
and
artery
seemed
to
tingle
with
health
;
the
exquisite
beauty
of
the
opening
day
,
when
light
came
gleaming
off
from
everything
;
the
lazy
motion
of
the
boat
,
when
one
lay
idly
on
the
deck
,
looking
through
,
rather
than
at
,
the
deep
blue
sky
;
the
gliding
on
at
night
,
so
noiselessly
,
past
frowning
hills
,
sullen
with
dark
trees
,
and
sometimes
angry
in
one
red
,
burning
spot
high
up
,
where
unseen
men
lay
crouching
round
a
fire
;
the
shining
out
of
the
bright
stars
undisturbed
by
noise
of
wheels
or
steam
,
or
any
other
sound
than
the
limpid
rippling
of
the
water
as
the
boat
went
on
:
 
all
these
were
pure
delights
.
   
<EOS>
Then
there
were
new
settlements
and
detached
log
-
cabins
and
frame
-
houses
,
full
of
interest
for
strangers
from
an
old
country
:
 
cabins
with
simple
ovens
,
outside
,
made
of
clay
;
and
lodgings
for
the
pigs
nearly
as
good
as
many
of
the
human
quarters
;
broken
windows
,
patched
with
worn
-
out
hats
,
old
clothes
,
old
boards
,
fragments
of
blankets
and
paper
;
and
home
-
made
dressers
standing
in
the
open
air
without
the
door
,
whereon
was
ranged
the
household
store
,
not
hard
to
count
,
of
earthen
jars
and
pots
.
 
<EOS>
The
eye
was
pained
to
see
the
stumps
of
great
trees
thickly
strewn
in
every
field
of
wheat
,
and
seldom
to
lose
the
eternal
swamp
and
dull
morass
,
with
hundreds
of
rotten
trunks
and
twisted
branches
steeped
in
its
unwholesome
water
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
sad
and
oppressive
,
to
come
upon
great
tracts
where
settlers
had
been
burning
down
the
trees
,
and
where
their
wounded
bodies
lay
about
,
like
those
of
murdered
creatures
,
while
here
<EOS>
and
there
some
charred
and
blackened
giant
reared
aloft
two
withered
arms
,
and
seemed
to
call
down
curses
on
his
foes
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
at
night
,
the
way
wound
through
some
lonely
gorge
,
like
a
mountain
pass
in
Scotland
,
shining
and
coldly
glittering
in
the
light
of
the
moon
,
and
so
closed
in
by
high
steep
hills
all
round
,
that
there
seemed
to
be
no
egress
save
through
the
narrower
path
by
which
we
had
come
,
until
one
rugged
hill
-
side
seemed
to
open
,
and
shutting
out
the
moonlight
as
we
passed
into
its
gloomy
throat
,
wrapped
our
new
course
in
shade
and
darkness
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
left
Harrisburg
on
Friday
.
 
<EOS>
On
Sunday
morning
we
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
,
which
is
crossed
by
railroad
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
ten
inclined
planes
;
five
ascending
,
and
five
descending
;
the
carriages
are
dragged
up
the
former
,
and
let
slowly
down
the
latter
,
by
means
of
stationary
engines
;
the
comparatively
level
spaces
between
,
being
traversed
,
sometimes
by
horse
,
and
sometimes
by
engine
power
,
as
the
case
demands
.
 
<EOS>
Occasionally
the
rails
are
laid
upon
the
extreme
verge
of
a
giddy
precipice
;
and
looking
from
the
carriage
window
,
the
traveller
gazes
sheer
down
,
without
a
stone
or
scrap
of
fence
between
,
into
the
mountain
depths
below
.
<EOS>
The
journey
is
very
carefully
made
,
however
;
only
two
carriages
travelling
together
;
and
while
proper
precautions
are
taken
,
is
not
to
be
dreaded
for
its
dangers
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
very
pretty
travelling
thus
,
at
a
rapid
pace
along
the
heights
of
the
mountain
in
a
keen
wind
,
to
look
down
into
a
valley
full
of
light
and
softness
;
catching
glimpses
,
through
the
tree
-
tops
,
of
scattered
cabins
;
<EOS>
children
running
to
the
doors
;
dogs
bursting
out
to
bark
,
whom
we
could
see
without
hearing
:
 
terrified
pigs
scampering
homewards
;
families
sitting
out
in
their
rude
gardens
;
cows
gazing
upward
with
a
stupid
indifference
;
men
in
their
shirt
-
sleeves
looking
on
at
their
unfinished
houses
,
planning
out
to
-
morrow
's
work
;
and
we
riding
onward
,
high
above
them
,
like
a
whirlwind
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
amusing
,
too
,
when
we
had
dined
,
and
rattled
down
a
steep
pass
,
having
no
other
moving
power
than
the
weight
of
the
carriages
themselves
,
to
see
the
engine
released
,
long
after
us
,
come
buzzing
down
alone
,
like
a
great
insect
,
its
back
of
green
and
gold
so
shining
in
the
sun
,
that
if
it
had
spread
a
pair
of
wings
and
soared
away
,
no
one
would
have
had
occasion
,
as
I
fancied
,
for
the
least
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
stopped
short
of
us
in
a
very
business
-
like
manner
when
we
reached
the
canal
:
 
and
,
before
we
left
the
wharf
,
went
panting
up
this
hill
again
,
with
the
passengers
who
had
waited
our
arrival
for
the
means
of
traversing
the
road
by
which
we
had
come
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
Monday
evening
,
furnace
fires
and
clanking
hammers
on
the
banks
of
the
canal
,
warned
us
that
we
approached
the
termination
of
this
part
of
our
journey
.
 
<EOS>
After
going
through
another
dreamy
place
---
a
long
aqueduct
across
the
Alleghany
River
,
which
was
stranger
than
the
bridge
at
Harrisburg
,
being
a
vast
,
low
,
wooden
chamber
full
of
water
---
we
emerged
upon
that
ugly
confusion
of
backs
of
buildings
and
crazy
galleries
and
stairs
,
which
always
abuts
on
water
,
whether
it
be
river
,
sea
,
canal
,
or
ditch
:
 
and
were
at
Pittsburg
.
   
<EOS>
Pittsburg
is
like
Birmingham
in
England
;
at
least
its
townspeople
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
Setting
aside
the
streets
,
the
shops
,
the
houses
,
waggons
,
factories
,
public
buildings
,
and
population
,
perhaps
it
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
certainly
has
a
great
quantity
of
smoke
hanging
about
it
,
and
is
famous
for
its
iron
-
works
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
the
prison
to
which
I
have
already
referred
,
this
town
contains
a
pretty
arsenal
and
other
institutions
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
beautifully
situated
on
the
Alleghany
River
,
over
which
there
are
two
bridges
;
and
the
villas
of
the
wealthier
citizens
sprinkled
about
the
high
grounds
in
the
neighbourhood
,
are
pretty
enough
.
 
<EOS>
We
lodged
at
a
most
excellent
hotel
,
and
were
admirably
served
.
 
<EOS>
As
usual
it
was
full
of
boarders
,
was
very
large
,
and
had
a
broad
colonnade
to
every
story
of
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
We
tarried
here
three
days
.
 
<EOS>
Our
next
point
was
Cincinnati
:
 
and
as
this
was
a
steamboat
journey
,
and
western
steamboats
usually
blow
up
one
or
two
a
week
in
the
season
,
it
was
advisable
to
collect
opinions
in
reference
to
the
comparative
safety
of
the
vessels
bound
that
way
,
then
lying
in
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
One
called
the
Messenger
was
the
best
recommended
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
advertised
to
start
positively
,
every
day
for
a
fortnight
or
so
,
and
had
not
gone
yet
,
nor
did
her
captain
seem
to
have
any
very
fixed
intention
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
is
the
custom
:
 
for
if
the
law
were
to
bind
down
a
free
and
independent
citizen
to
keep
his
word
with
the
public
,
what
would
become
of
the
liberty
of
the
subject
?
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
is
in
the
way
of
trade
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
passengers
be
decoyed
in
the
way
of
trade
,
and
people
be
inconvenienced
in
the
way
of
trade
,
what
man
,
who
is
a
sharp
tradesman
himself
,
shall
say
,
"
We
must
put
a
stop
to
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
Impressed
by
the
deep
solemnity
of
the
public
announcement
<EOS>
,
I
(
being
then
ignorant
of
these
usages
)
was
for
hurrying
on
board
in
a
breathless
state
,
immediately
;
but
receiving
private
and
confidential
information
that
the
boat
would
certainly
not
start
until
Friday
,
April
the
First
,
we
made
ourselves
very
comfortable
in
the
mean
while
,
and
went
on
board
at
noon
that
day
.

From
Pittsburg
to
Cincinnati
in
a
Western
Steamboat
.
<EOS>
Cincinnati
 
<EOS>
THE
Messenger
was
one
among
a
crowd
of
high
-
pressure
steamboats
,
clustered
together
by
a
wharf
-
side
,
which
,
looked
down
upon
from
the
rising
ground
that
forms
the
landing
-
place
,
and
backed
by
the
lofty
bank
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
,
appeared
no
larger
than
so
many
floating
models
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
some
forty
passengers
on
board
,
exclusive
of
the
poorer
persons
on
the
lower
deck
;
and
in
half
an
hour
,
or
less
,
proceeded
on
her
way
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
,
for
ourselves
,
a
tiny
state
-
room
with
two
berths
in
it
,
opening
out
of
the
ladies
'
cabin
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
,
undoubtedly
,
something
satisfactory
in
this
"
location
,
"
inasmuch
as
it
was
in
the
stern
,
and
we
had
been
a
great
many
times
very
gravely
recommended
to
keep
as
far
aft
as
possible
,
"
because
the
steamboats
generally
blew
up
forward
.
"
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
an
unnecessary
caution
,
as
the
occurrence
and
circumstances
of
more
than
one
such
fatality
during
our
stay
sufficiently
testified
.
 
<EOS>
Apart
from
this
source
of
self
-
congratulation
,
it
was
an
unspeakable
relief
to
have
any
place
,
no
matter
how
confined
,
where
one
could
be
alone
:
 
and
as
the
row
of
little
chambers
of
which
this
was
one
,
had
each
a
second
glass
-
door
besides
that
in
the
ladies
'
cabin
,
which
opened
on
a
narrow
gallery
outside
the
vessel
,
where
the
other
passengers
seldom
came
,
and
where
one
could
sit
in
peace
and
gaze
upon
the
shifting
prospect
,
we
took
possession
of
our
new
quarters
with
much
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
If
the
native
packets
I
have
already
described
be
unlike
anything
we
are
in
the
habit
of
seeing
on
water
,
these
western
vessels
are
still
more
foreign
to
all
the
ideas
we
are
accustomed
to
entertain
of
boats
.
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
what
to
liken
them
to
,
or
how
to
describe
them
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
they
have
no
mast
,
cordage
,
tackle
,
rigging
,
or
other
such
boat
-
like
gear
;
nor
have
they
anything
in
their
shape
at
all
calculated
to
remind
one
of
a
boat
's
head
,
stem
,
sides
,
or
keel
.
 
<EOS>
Except
that
they
are
in
the
water
,
and
display
a
couple
of
paddle
-
boxes
,
they
might
be
intended
,
for
anything
that
appears
to
the
contrary
,
to
perform
some
unknown
service
,
high
and
dry
,
upon
a
mountain
top
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
visible
deck
,
even
:
 
nothing
but
a
long
,
black
,
ugly
roof
covered
with
burnt
-
out
feathery
sparks
;
above
which
tower
two
iron
chimneys
,
and
a
hoarse
escape
valve
,
and
a
glass
steerage
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
in
order
as
the
eye
descends
towards
the
water
,
are
the
sides
,
and
doors
,
and
windows
of
the
state
-
rooms
,
jumbled
as
oddly
together
as
though
they
formed
a
small
street
,
built
by
the
varying
tastes
of
a
dozen
men
:
 
<EOS>
the
whole
is
supported
on
beams
and
pillars
resting
on
a
dirty
barge
,
but
a
few
inches
above
the
water
's
edge
:
 
and
in
the
narrow
space
between
this
upper
structure
and
this
barge
's
deck
,
are
the
furnace
fires
and
machinery
,
open
at
the
sides
to
every
wind
that
blows
,
and
every
storm
of
rain
it
drives
along
its
path
.
   
<EOS>
Passing
one
of
these
boats
at
night
,
and
seeing
the
great
body
of
fire
,
exposed
as
I
have
just
described
,
that
rages
and
roars
beneath
the
frail
pile
of
painted
wood
:
 
the
machinery
,
not
warded
off
or
guarded
in
any
way
,
but
doing
its
work
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
of
idlers
and
emigrants
and
children
,
who
throng
the
lower
deck
:
 
under
the
management
,
too
,
of
reckless
men
whose
acquaintance
with
its
mysteries
may
have
been
of
six
months
'
standing
:
 
<EOS>
one
feels
directly
that
the
wonder
is
,
not
that
there
should
be
so
many
fatal
accidents
,
but
that
any
journey
should
be
safely
made
.
   
<EOS>
Within
,
there
is
one
long
narrow
cabin
,
the
whole
length
of
the
boat
;
from
which
the
state
-
rooms
open
,
on
both
sides
.
 
<EOS>
A
small
portion
of
it
at
the
stern
is
partitioned
off
for
the
ladies
;
and
the
bar
is
at
the
opposite
extreme
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
long
table
down
the
centre
,
and
at
either
end
a
stove
.
 
<EOS>
The
washing
apparatus
is
forward
,
on
the
deck
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
little
better
than
on
board
the
canal
boat
,
but
not
much
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
modes
of
travelling
,
the
American
customs
,
with
reference
to
the
means
of
personal
cleanliness
and
wholesome
ablution
,
are
extremely
negligent
and
filthy
;
and
I
strongly
incline
to
the
belief
that
a
considerable
amount
of
illness
is
referable
to
this
cause
.
   
<EOS>
We
are
to
be
on
board
the
Messenger
three
days
:
 
arriving
at
Cincinnati
(
barring
accidents
)
on
Monday
morning
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
three
meals
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
Breakfast
at
seven
,
dinner
at
half
-
past
twelve
,
supper
about
six
.
 
<EOS>
At
each
,
there
are
a
great
many
small
dishes
and
plates
upon
the
table
,
with
very
little
in
them
;
so
that
although
there
is
every
appearance
of
a
mighty
"
spread
,
"
there
is
seldom
really
more
than
a
joint
:
 
except
for
those
who
fancy
slices
of
beet
-
root
,
shreds
of
dried
beef
,
complicated
entanglements
of
yellow
pickle
;
maize
,
Indian
corn
,
apple
-
sauce
,
and
pumpkin
.
   
<EOS>
Some
people
fancy
all
these
little
dainties
together
(
and
sweet
preserves
beside
)
,
by
way
of
relish
to
their
roast
pig
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
generally
those
dyspeptic
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
eat
unheard
-
of
quantities
of
hot
corn
bread
(
almost
as
good
for
the
digestion
as
a
kneaded
pin
-
cushion
)
,
for
breakfast
,
and
for
supper
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
do
not
observe
this
custom
,
and
who
help
themselves
several
times
instead
,
usually
suck
their
knives
and
forks
meditatively
,
until
they
have
decided
what
to
take
next
:
 
then
pull
them
out
of
their
mouths
:
 
put
them
in
the
dish
;
help
themselves
;
and
fall
to
work
again
.
 
<EOS>
At
dinner
,
there
is
nothing
to
drink
upon
the
table
,
but
great
jugs
full
of
cold
water
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
says
anything
,
at
any
meal
,
to
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
passengers
are
very
dismal
,
and
seem
to
have
tremendous
secrets
weighing
on
their
minds
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
conversation
,
no
laughter
,
no
cheerfulness
,
no
sociality
,
except
in
spitting
;
and
that
is
done
in
silent
fellowship
round
the
stove
,
when
the
meal
is
over
.
 
<EOS>
Every
man
sits
down
,
dull
and
languid
;
swallows
his
fare
as
if
breakfasts
,
dinners
,
and
suppers
,
were
necessities
of
nature
never
to
be
coupled
with
recreation
or
enjoyment
;
and
having
bolted
his
food
in
a
gloomy
silence
,
bolts
himself
,
in
the
same
state
.
 
<EOS>
But
for
these
animal
observances
,
you
might
suppose
the
whole
male
portion
of
the
company
to
be
the
melancholy
ghosts
of
departed
book
-
keepers
,
who
had
fallen
dead
at
the
desk
:
 
<EOS>
such
is
their
weary
air
of
business
and
calculation
.
<EOS>
Undertakers
on
duty
would
be
sprightly
beside
them
;
and
a
collation
of
funeral
-
baked
meats
,
in
comparison
with
these
meals
,
would
be
a
sparkling
festivity
.
   
<EOS>
The
people
are
all
alike
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
diversity
of
character
.
<EOS>
They
travel
about
on
the
same
errands
,
say
and
do
the
same
things
in
exactly
the
same
manner
,
and
follow
in
the
same
dull
cheerless
round
.
 
<EOS>
All
down
the
long
table
,
there
is
scarcely
a
man
who
is
in
anything
different
from
his
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
quite
a
relief
to
have
,
sitting
opposite
,
that
little
girl
of
fifteen
with
the
loquacious
chin
:
 
who
,
to
do
her
justice
,
acts
up
to
it
,
and
fully
identifies
nature
's
handwriting
,
for
of
all
the
small
chatterboxes
that
ever
invaded
the
repose
of
drowsy
ladies
'
cabin
,
she
is
the
first
and
foremost
.
 
<EOS>
The
beautiful
girl
,
who
sits
a
little
beyond
her
---
farther
down
the
table
there
---
married
the
young
man
with
the
dark
whiskers
,
who
sits
beyond
HER
,
only
last
month
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
going
to
settle
in
the
very
Far
West
,
where
he
has
lived
four
years
,
but
where
she
has
never
been
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
both
overturned
in
a
stage
-
coach
the
other
day
(
a
bad
omen
anywhere
else
,
where
overturns
are
not
so
common
)
,
and
his
head
,
which
bears
the
marks
of
a
recent
wound
,
is
bound
up
still
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
hurt
too
,
at
the
same
time
,
and
lay
insensible
for
some
days
;
bright
as
her
eyes
are
,
now
.
   
<EOS>
Further
down
still
,
sits
a
man
who
is
going
some
miles
beyond
their
place
of
destination
,
to
"
improve
"
a
newly
-
discovered
copper
mine
.
<EOS>
He
carries
the
village
---
that
is
to
be
---
with
him
:
 
a
few
frame
cottages
,
and
an
apparatus
for
smelting
the
copper
.
 
<EOS>
He
carries
its
people
too
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
partly
American
and
partly
Irish
,
and
herd
together
on
the
lower
deck
;
where
they
amused
themselves
last
evening
till
the
night
was
pretty
far
advanced
,
by
alternately
firing
off
pistols
and
singing
hymns
.
   
<EOS>
They
,
and
the
very
few
who
have
been
left
at
table
twenty
minutes
,
rise
,
and
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
so
too
;
and
passing
through
our
little
state
-
room
,
resume
our
seats
in
the
quiet
gallery
without
.
   
<EOS>
A
fine
broad
river
always
,
<EOS>
but
in
some
parts
much
wider
than
in
others
:
 
<EOS>
and
then
there
is
usually
a
green
island
,
covered
with
trees
,
dividing
it
into
two
streams
.
 
<EOS>
Occasionally
,
we
stop
for
a
few
minutes
,
maybe
to
take
in
wood
,
maybe
for
passengers
,
at
some
small
town
or
village
<EOS>
(
I
ought
to
say
city
,
every
place
is
a
city
here
)
;
but
the
banks
are
for
the
most
part
deep
solitudes
,
overgrown
with
trees
,
which
,
hereabouts
,
are
already
in
leaf
and
very
green
.
 
<EOS>
For
miles
,
and
miles
,
and
miles
,
these
solitudes
are
unbroken
by
any
sign
of
human
life
or
trace
of
human
footstep
;
nor
is
anything
seen
to
move
about
them
but
the
blue
jay
,
whose
colour
is
so
bright
,
and
yet
so
delicate
,
that
it
looks
like
a
flying
flower
.
 
<EOS>
At
lengthened
intervals
<EOS>
a
log
cabin
,
with
its
little
space
of
cleared
land
about
it
,
nestles
under
a
rising
ground
,
and
sends
its
thread
of
blue
smoke
curling
up
into
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
It
stands
in
the
corner
of
the
poor
field
of
wheat
,
which
is
full
of
great
unsightly
stumps
,
like
earthy
butchers'-blocks
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
the
ground
is
only
just
now
cleared
:
 
the
felled
trees
lying
yet
upon
the
soil
:
 
and
the
log
-
house
only
this
morning
begun
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
pass
this
clearing
,
the
settler
leans
upon
his
axe
or
hammer
,
and
looks
wistfully
at
the
people
from
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
The
children
creep
out
of
the
temporary
hut
,
which
is
like
a
gipsy
tent
upon
the
ground
,
and
clap
their
hands
and
shout
.
 
<EOS>
The
dog
only
glances
round
at
us
,
and
then
looks
up
into
his
master
's
face
again
,
as
if
he
were
rendered
uneasy
by
any
suspension
of
the
common
business
,
and
had
nothing
more
to
do
with
pleasurers
.
 
<EOS>
And
still
there
is
the
same
,
eternal
foreground
.
<EOS>
The
river
has
washed
away
its
banks
,
and
stately
trees
have
fallen
down
into
the
stream
.
 
<EOS>
Some
have
been
there
so
long
,
that
they
are
mere
dry
,
grizzly
skeletons
.
 
<EOS>
Some
have
just
toppled
over
,
and
having
earth
yet
about
their
roots
,
are
bathing
their
green
heads
in
the
river
,
and
putting
forth
new
shoots
and
branches
.
 
<EOS>
Some
are
almost
sliding
down
,
as
you
look
at
them
.
 
<EOS>
And
some
were
drowned
so
long
ago
,
that
their
bleached
arms
start
out
from
the
middle
of
the
current
,
and
seem
to
try
to
grasp
the
boat
,
and
drag
it
under
water
.
   
<EOS>
Through
such
a
scene
as
this
,
the
unwieldy
machine
takes
its
hoarse
,
sullen
way
:
 
venting
,
at
every
revolution
of
the
paddles
,
a
loud
high
-
pressure
blast
;
enough
,
one
would
think
,
to
waken
up
the
host
of
Indians
who
lie
buried
in
a
great
mound
yonder
:
 
<EOS>
so
old
,
that
mighty
oaks
and
other
forest
trees
have
struck
their
roots
into
its
earth
;
and
so
high
,
that
it
is
a
hill
,
even
among
the
hills
that
Nature
planted
round
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
river
,
as
though
it
shared
one
's
feelings
of
compassion
for
the
extinct
tribes
who
lived
so
pleasantly
here
,
in
their
blessed
ignorance
of
white
existence
,
hundreds
of
years
ago
,
steals
out
of
its
way
to
ripple
near
this
mound
:
 
and
there
are
few
places
where
the
Ohio
sparkles
more
brightly
than
in
the
Big
Grave
Creek
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
I
see
as
I
sit
in
the
little
stern
-
gallery
mentioned
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
Evening
slowly
steals
upon
the
landscape
and
changes
it
before
me
,
when
we
stop
to
set
some
emigrants
ashore
.
   
<EOS>
Five
men
,
as
many
women
,
and
a
little
girl
.
 
<EOS>
All
their
worldly
goods
are
a
bag
,
a
large
chest
and
an
old
chair
:
 
one
,
old
,
high
-
backed
,
rush
-
bottomed
chair
:
 
a
solitary
settler
in
itself
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
rowed
ashore
in
the
boat
,
while
the
vessel
stands
a
little
off
awaiting
its
return
,
the
water
being
shallow
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
landed
at
the
foot
of
a
high
bank
,
on
<EOS>
the
summit
of
which
are
a
few
log
cabins
,
attainable
only
by
a
long
winding
path
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
growing
dusk
;
but
the
sun
is
very
red
,
and
shines
in
the
water
and
on
some
of
the
tree
-
tops
,
like
fire
.
   
<EOS>
The
men
get
out
of
the
boat
first
;
help
out
the
women
;
take
out
the
bag
,
the
chest
,
the
chair
;
bid
the
rowers
"
good
-
bye
;
"
and
shove
the
boat
off
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
first
plash
of
the
oars
in
the
water
,
the
oldest
woman
of
the
party
sits
down
in
the
old
chair
,
close
to
the
water
's
edge
,
without
speaking
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
None
of
the
others
sit
down
,
though
the
chest
is
large
enough
for
many
seats
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
stand
where
they
landed
,
as
if
stricken
into
stone
;
and
look
after
the
boat
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
remain
,
quite
still
and
silent
:
 
<EOS>
the
old
woman
and
her
old
chair
,
in
the
centre
the
bag
and
chest
upon
the
shore
,
without
anybody
heeding
them
all
eyes
fixed
upon
the
boat
.
 
<EOS>
It
comes
alongside
,
is
made
fast
,
the
men
jump
on
board
,
the
engine
is
put
in
motion
,
and
we
go
hoarsely
on
again
.
 
<EOS>
There
they
stand
yet
,
without
the
motion
of
a
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
see
them
through
my
glass
,
when
,
in
the
distance
and
increasing
darkness
,
they
are
mere
specks
to
the
eye
:
 
lingering
there
still
:
 
the
old
woman
in
the
old
chair
,
and
all
the
rest
about
her
:
 
not
stirring
in
the
least
degree
.
 
<EOS>
And
thus
I
slowly
lose
them
.
   
<EOS>
The
night
is
dark
,
and
we
proceed
within
the
shadow
of
the
wooded
bank
,
which
makes
it
darker
.
 
<EOS>
After
gliding
past
the
sombre
maze
of
boughs
for
a
long
time
,
we
come
upon
an
open
space
where
the
tall
trees
are
burning
.
 
<EOS>
The
shape
of
every
branch
and
twig
is
expressed
in
a
deep
red
glow
,
and
as
the
light
wind
stirs
and
ruffles
it
,
they
seem
to
vegetate
in
fire
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
such
a
sight
as
we
read
of
in
legends
of
enchanted
forests
:
 
saving
that
it
is
sad
to
see
these
noble
works
wasting
away
so
awfully
,
alone
;
and
to
think
how
many
years
must
come
and
go
before
the
magic
that
created
them
will
rear
their
like
upon
this
ground
again
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
time
will
come
;
and
when
,
in
their
changed
ashes
,
the
growth
of
centuries
unborn
has
struck
its
roots
,
the
restless
men
of
distant
ages
will
repair
to
these
again
unpeopled
solitudes
;
and
their
fellows
,
in
cities
far
away
,
that
slumber
now
,
perhaps
,
beneath
the
rolling
sea
,
will
read
in
language
strange
to
any
ears
in
being
now
,
but
very
old
to
them
,
of
primeval
forests
where
the
axe
was
never
heard
,
and
where
the
jungled
ground
was
never
trodden
by
a
human
foot
.
   
<EOS>
Midnight
and
sleep
blot
out
these
scenes
and
thoughts
:
 
and
when
the
morning
shines
again
,
it
gilds
the
house
-
tops
of
a
lively
city
,
before
whose
broad
paved
wharf
the
boat
is
moored
;
with
other
boats
,
and
flags
,
and
moving
wheels
,
and
hum
of
men
around
it
;
as
though
there
were
not
a
solitary
or
silent
rood
of
ground
within
the
compass
of
a
thousand
miles
.
   
<EOS>
Cincinnati
is
a
beautiful
city
;
cheerful
,
thriving
,
and
animated
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
often
seen
a
place
that
commends
itself
so
favourably
and
pleasantly
to
a
stranger
at
the
first
glance
as
this
does
:
with
its
clean
houses
of
red
and
white
,
its
well
-
paved
roads
,
and
foot
-
ways
of
bright
tile
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
does
it
become
less
prepossessing
on
a
closer
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
The
streets
are
broad
and
airy
,
the
shops
extremely
good
,
the
private
residences
remarkable
for
their
elegance
and
neatness
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
something
of
invention
and
fancy
in
the
varying
styles
of
these
latter
erections
,
which
,
after
the
dull
company
of
the
steamboat
,
is
perfectly
delightful
,
as
conveying
an
assurance
that
there
are
such
qualities
still
in
existence
.
 
<EOS>
The
disposition
to
ornament
these
pretty
villas
and
render
them
attractive
,
leads
to
the
culture
of
trees
and
flowers
,
and
the
laying
out
of
well
-
kept
gardens
,
the
sight
of
which
,
to
those
who
walk
along
the
streets
,
is
inexpressibly
refreshing
and
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
quite
charmed
with
the
appearance
of
the
town
,
and
its
adjoining
suburb
of
Mount
Auburn
:
 
from
which
the
city
,
lying
in
an
amphitheatre
of
hills
,
forms
a
picture
of
remarkable
beauty
,
and
is
seen
to
great
advantage
.
   
<EOS>
There
happened
to
be
a
great
Temperance
Convention
held
here
on
the
day
after
our
arrival
;
and
as
the
order
of
march
brought
the
procession
under
the
windows
of
the
hotel
in
which
we
lodged
,
when
they
started
in
the
morning
,
I
had
a
good
opportunity
of
seeing
it
.
<EOS>
It
comprised
several
thousand
men
;
the
members
of
various
"
Washington
Auxiliary
Temperance
Societies
;
"
and
was
marshalled
by
officers
on
horseback
,
who
cantered
briskly
up
and
down
the
line
,
with
scarves
and
ribbons
of
bright
colours
fluttering
out
behind
them
gaily
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
bands
of
music
too
,
and
banners
out
of
number
:
 
and
<EOS>
it
was
a
fresh
,
holiday
-
looking
concourse
altogether
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
particularly
pleased
to
see
the
Irishmen
,
who
formed
a
distinct
society
among
themselves
,
and
mustered
very
strong
with
their
green
scarves
;
carrying
their
national
Harp
and
their
Portrait
of
Father
Mathew
,
high
above
the
people
's
heads
.
 
<EOS>
They
looked
as
jolly
and
good
-
humoured
as
ever
;
and
,
working
(
here
)
<EOS>
the
hardest
for
their
living
and
doing
any
kind
of
sturdy
labour
that
came
in
their
way
,
were
the
most
independent
fellows
there
,
I
thought
.
   
<EOS>
The
banners
were
very
well
painted
,
and
flaunted
down
the
street
famously
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
smiting
of
the
rock
,
and
the
gushing
forth
of
the
waters
;
and
there
was
a
temperate
man
with
"
considerable
of
a
hatchet
"
(
as
the
standard
-
bearer
would
probably
have
said
)
,
aiming
a
deadly
blow
at
a
serpent
which
was
apparently
about
to
spring
upon
him
from
the
top
of
a
barrel
of
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
chief
feature
of
this
part
of
the
show
was
a
huge
allegorical
device
,
borne
among
the
ship
-
carpenters
<EOS>
,
on
one
side
whereof
the
steamboat
Alcohol
was
represented
bursting
her
boiler
and
exploding
with
a
great
crash
,
while
upon
the
other
,
the
good
ship
Temperance
sailed
away
with
a
fair
wind
,
to
the
heart
's
content
of
the
captain
,
crew
,
and
passengers
.
   
<EOS>
After
going
round
the
town
,
the
procession
repaired
to
a
certain
appointed
place
,
where
,
as
the
printed
programme
set
forth
,
it
would
be
received
by
the
children
of
the
different
free
schools
,
"
singing
Temperance
Songs
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
was
prevented
from
getting
there
,
in
time
to
hear
these
Little
Warblers
,
or
to
report
upon
this
novel
kind
of
vocal
entertainment
:
 
novel
,
at
least
,
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
found
in
a
large
open
space
,
each
society
gathered
round
its
own
banners
,
and
listening
in
silent
attention
to
its
own
orator
.
 
<EOS>
The
speeches
,
judging
from
the
little
I
could
hear
of
them
,
were
certainly
adapted
to
the
occasion
,
as
having
that
degree
of
relationship
to
cold
water
which
wet
blankets
may
claim
:
 
but
the
main
thing
was
the
conduct
and
appearance
of
the
audience
throughout
the
day
;
and
that
was
admirable
and
full
of
promise
.
   
<EOS>
Cincinnati
is
honourably
famous
for
its
free
schools
,
of
which
it
has
so
many
that
no
person
's
child
among
its
population
can
,
by
possibility
,
want
the
means
of
education
,
which
are
extended
,
upon
an
average
,
to
four
thousand
pupils
,
annually
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
only
present
in
one
of
these
establishments
during
the
hours
of
instruction
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
boys
'
department
,
which
was
full
of
little
urchins
(
varying
in
their
ages
,
I
should
say
,
from
six
years
old
to
ten
or
twelve
)
,
the
master
offered
to
institute
an
extemporary
examination
of
the
pupils
in
algebra
;
a
proposal
,
which
,
as
I
was
by
no
means
confident
of
my
ability
to
detect
mistakes
in
that
science
,
I
declined
with
some
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
girls
'
school
,
reading
was
proposed
;
and
as
I
felt
tolerably
equal
to
that
art
,
I
expressed
my
willingness
to
hear
a
class
.
 
<EOS>
Books
were
distributed
accordingly
,
and
some
half
-
dozen
girls
relieved
each
other
in
reading
paragraphs
from
English
History
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
seemed
to
be
a
dry
compilation
,
infinitely
above
their
powers
;
and
when
they
had
blundered
through
three
or
four
dreary
passages
concerning
the
Treaty
of
Amiens
,
and
other
thrilling
topics
of
the
same
nature
(
obviously
without
comprehending
ten
words
)
,
I
expressed
myself
quite
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
possible
that
they
only
mounted
to
this
exalted
stave
in
the
Ladder
of
Learning
for
the
astonishment
of
a
visitor
;
and
that
at
other
times
they
keep
upon
its
lower
rounds
;
but
I
should
have
been
much
better
pleased
and
satisfied
if
I
had
heard
them
exercised
in
simpler
lessons
,
which
they
understood
.
   
<EOS>
As
in
every
other
place
I
visited
,
the
judges
here
were
gentlemen
of
high
character
and
attainments
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
in
one
of
the
courts
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
found
it
like
those
to
which
I
have
already
referred
.
 
<EOS>
A
nuisance
cause
was
trying
;
there
were
not
many
spectators
;
and
the
witnesses
,
counsel
,
and
jury
,
formed
a
sort
of
family
circle
,
sufficiently
jocose
and
snug
.
   
<EOS>
The
society
with
which
I
mingled
,
was
intelligent
,
courteous
,
and
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
of
Cincinnati
are
proud
of
their
city
as
one
of
the
most
interesting
in
America
:
 
and
with
good
reason
:
for
beautiful
and
thriving
as
it
is
now
,
and
containing
,
as
it
does
,
a
population
of
fifty
thousand
souls
,
but
two
-
and
-
fifty
years
have
passed
away
since
the
ground
on
which
it
stands
(
bought
at
that
time
for
a
few
dollars
)
was
a
wild
wood
,
and
its
citizens
were
but
a
handful
of
dwellers
in
scattered
log
huts
upon
the
river
's
shore
.

LEAVING
Cincinnati
at
eleven
o'clock
in
the
forenoon
,
we
embarked
for
Louisville
in
the
Pike
steamboat
,
which
,
carrying
the
mails
,
was
a
packet
of
a
much
better
class
than
that
in
which
we
had
come
from
Pittsburg
.
 
<EOS>
As
this
passage
does
not
occupy
more
than
twelve
or
thirteen
hours
,
we
arranged
to
go
ashore
that
night
:
 
not
coveting
the
distinction
of
sleeping
in
a
state
-
room
,
when
it
was
possible
to
sleep
anywhere
else
.
   
<EOS>
There
chanced
to
be
on
board
this
boat
,
in
addition
to
the
usual
dreary
crowd
of
passengers
,
one
Pitchlynn
,
a
chief
of
the
Choctaw
tribe
of
Indians
,
who
SENT
IN
HIS
CARD
to
me
,
and
with
whom
I
had
the
pleasure
of
a
long
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
He
spoke
English
perfectly
well
,
though
he
had
not
begun
to
learn
the
language
,
he
told
me
,
until
he
was
a
young
man
grown
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
read
many
books
;
and
Scott
's
poetry
appeared
to
have
left
a
strong
impression
on
his
mind
:
 
especially
the
opening
of
The
Lady
of
the
Lake
,
and
the
great
battle
scene
in
Marmion
,
in
which
,
no
doubt
from
the
congeniality
of
the
subjects
to
his
own
pursuits
and
tastes
,
he
had
great
interest
and
delight
.
 
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
understand
correctly
all
he
had
read
;
and
whatever
fiction
had
enlisted
his
sympathy
in
its
belief
,
had
done
so
keenly
and
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
I
might
almost
say
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
our
ordinary
everyday
costume
,
which
hung
about
his
fine
figure
loosely
,
and
with
indifferent
grace
.
 
<EOS>
On
my
telling
him
that
I
regretted
not
to
see
him
in
his
own
attire
,
he
threw
up
his
right
arm
,
for
a
moment
,
as
though
he
were
brandishing
some
heavy
weapon
,
and
answered
,
as
he
let
it
fall
again
,
that
his
race
were
losing
many
things
besides
their
dress
,
and
would
soon
be
seen
upon
the
earth
no
more
:
 
but
he
wore
it
at
home
,
he
added
proudly
.
   
<EOS>
He
told
me
that
he
had
been
away
from
his
home
,
west
of
the
Mississippi
,
seventeen
months
:
 
and
was
now
returning
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
chiefly
at
Washington
on
some
negotiations
pending
between
his
Tribe
and
the
Government
:
 
which
were
not
settled
yet
(
he
said
in
a
melancholy
way
)
,
and
he
feared
never
would
be
:
 
for
what
could
a
few
poor
Indians
do
,
against
such
well
-
skilled
men
of
business
as
the
whites
?
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
love
for
Washington
;
tired
of
towns
and
cities
very
soon
;
and
longed
for
the
Forest
and
the
Prairie
.
   
<EOS>
I
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
Congress
?
 
<EOS>
He
answered
,
with
a
smile
,
that
it
wanted
dignity
,
in
an
Indian
's
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
He
would
very
much
like
,
he
said
,
to
see
England
before
he
died
;
and
spoke
with
much
interest
about
the
great
things
to
be
seen
there
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
told
him
of
that
chamber
in
the
British
Museum
wherein
are
preserved
household
memorials
of
a
race
that
ceased
to
be
,
<EOS>
thousands
of
years
ago
,
he
was
very
attentive
,
and
it
was
not
hard
to
see
that
he
had
a
reference
in
his
mind
to
the
gradual
fading
away
of
his
own
people
.
   
<EOS>
This
led
us
to
speak
of
Mr
Catlin
's
gallery
,
which
he
praised
highly
:
 
<EOS>
observing
that
his
own
portrait
was
among
the
collection
,
and
that
all
the
likenesses
were
"
elegant
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Cooper
,
he
said
,
had
painted
the
Red
Man
well
;
and
so
would
I
<EOS>
,
he
knew
,
if
I
would
go
home
with
him
and
hunt
buffaloes
,
which
he
was
quite
anxious
I
should
do
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
told
him
that
supposing
<EOS>
I
went
,
I
should
not
be
very
likely
to
damage
the
buffaloes
much
,
he
took
it
as
a
great
joke
and
laughed
heartily
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
remarkably
handsome
man
;
some
years
past
forty
,
I
should
judge
;
with
long
black
hair
,
an
aquiline
nose
,
broad
cheek
-
bones
,
a
sunburnt
complexion
,
and
a
very
bright
,
keen
,
dark
,
and
piercing
eye
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
but
twenty
thousand
of
the
Choctaws
left
,
he
said
,
and
their
number
was
decreasing
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
of
his
brother
chiefs
had
been
obliged
to
become
civilised
,
and
to
make
themselves
acquainted
with
what
the
whites
knew
,
for
it
was
their
only
chance
of
existence
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
were
not
many
;
and
the
rest
were
as
they
always
had
been
.
 
<EOS>
He
dwelt
on
this
:
 
and
said
several
times
that
unless
they
tried
to
assimilate
themselves
to
their
conquerors
,
they
must
be
swept
away
before
the
strides
of
civilised
society
.
   
<EOS>
When
we
shook
hands
at
parting
,
I
told
him
he
must
come
to
England
,
as
he
longed
to
see
the
land
so
much
:
 
that
I
should
hope
to
see
him
there
,
one
day
:
 
and
that
I
could
promise
him
he
would
be
well
received
and
kindly
treated
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
evidently
pleased
by
this
assurance
,
though
he
rejoined
with
a
good
-
humoured
smile
and
an
arch
shake
of
his
head
,
that
the
English
used
to
be
very
fond
of
the
Red
Men
when
they
wanted
their
help
,
but
had
not
cared
much
for
them
,
since
.
   
<EOS>
He
took
his
leave
;
as
stately
and
complete
a
gentleman
of
Nature
's
making
,
as
ever
I
beheld
;
and
moved
among
the
people
in
the
boat
,
another
kind
of
being
.
 
<EOS>
He
sent
me
a
lithographed
portrait
of
himself
soon
afterwards
;
very
like
,
though
scarcely
handsome
enough
;
which
I
have
carefully
preserved
in
memory
of
our
brief
acquaintance
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
very
interesting
in
the
scenery
of
this
day
's
journey
,
which
brought
us
at
midnight
to
Louisville
.
 
<EOS>
We
slept
at
the
Galt
House
;
a
splendid
hotel
;
and
were
as
handsomely
lodged
as
though
we
had
been
in
Paris
,
rather
than
hundreds
of
miles
beyond
the
Alleghanies
.
   
<EOS>
The
city
presenting
no
objects
of
sufficient
interest
to
detain
us
on
our
way
,
we
resolved
to
proceed
next
day
by
another
steamboat
,
the
Fulton
,
and
to
join
it
,
about
noon
,
at
a
suburb
called
Portland
,
where
it
would
be
delayed
some
time
in
passing
through
a
canal
.
   
<EOS>
The
interval
,
after
breakfast
,
we
devoted
to
riding
through
the
town
,
which
is
regular
and
cheerful
:
 
<EOS>
the
streets
being
laid
out
at
right
angles
,
and
planted
with
young
trees
.
 
<EOS>
The
buildings
are
smoky
and
blackened
,
from
the
use
of
bituminous
coal
,
but
an
Englishman
is
well
used
to
that
appearance
,
and
indisposed
to
quarrel
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
did
not
appear
to
be
much
business
stirring
;
and
some
unfinished
buildings
and
improvements
seemed
to
intimate
that
the
city
had
been
overbuilt
in
the
ardour
of
"
going
-
a
-
head
,
"
and
was
suffering
under
the
re
-
action
consequent
upon
such
feverish
forcing
of
its
powers
.
   
<EOS>
On
our
way
to
Portland
,
we
passed
a
"
Magistrate
's
office
,
"
which
amused
me
,
as
looking
far
more
like
a
dame
school
than
any
police
establishment
:
 
for
this
awful
Institution
was
nothing
but
a
little
lazy
,
good
-
for
-
nothing
front
parlour
,
open
to
the
street
;
wherein
two
or
three
figures
(
I
presume
the
magistrate
and
his
myrmidons
)
were
basking
in
the
sunshine
,
the
very
effigies
of
languor
and
repose
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
perfect
picture
of
justice
retired
from
business
for
want
of
customers
;
her
sword
and
scales
sold
off
;
napping
comfortably
with
her
legs
upon
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
Here
,
as
elsewhere
in
these
parts
,
the
road
was
perfectly
alive
with
pigs
of
all
ages
;
lying
about
in
every
direction
,
fast
asleep
.
;
or
grunting
along
in
quest
of
hidden
dainties
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
always
a
sneaking
kindness
for
these
odd
animals
,
and
found
a
constant
source
of
amusement
,
when
all
others
failed
,
in
watching
their
proceedings
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
were
riding
along
this
morning
,
I
observed
a
little
incident
between
two
youthful
pigs
,
which
was
so
very
human
as
to
be
inexpressibly
comical
and
grotesque
at
the
time
,
though
I
dare
say
,
in
telling
,
it
is
tame
enough
.
   
<EOS>
One
young
gentleman
(
a
very
delicate
porker
with
several
straws
sticking
about
his
nose
,
betokening
recent
investigations
in
a
dung
-
hill
)
was
walking
deliberately
on
,
profoundly
thinking
,
when
suddenly
his
brother
,
who
was
lying
in
a
miry
hole
unseen
by
him
,
rose
up
immediately
before
his
startled
eyes
,
ghostly
with
damp
mud
.
 
<EOS>
Never
was
pig
's
whole
mass
of
blood
so
turned
.
 
<EOS>
He
started
back
at
least
three
feet
,
gazed
for
a
moment
,
and
then
shot
off
as
hard
as
he
could
go
:
 
his
excessively
little
tail
vibrating
with
speed
and
terror
like
a
distracted
pendulum
.
 
<EOS>
But
before
he
had
gone
very
far
,
he
began
to
reason
with
himself
as
to
the
nature
of
this
frightful
appearance
;
and
as
he
reasoned
,
he
relaxed
his
speed
by
gradual
degrees
;
until
at
last
he
stopped
,
and
faced
about
.
<EOS>
There
was
his
brother
,
with
the
mud
upon
him
glazing
in
the
sun
,
yet
staring
out
of
the
very
same
hole
,
perfectly
amazed
at
his
proceedings
!
 
<EOS>
He
was
no
sooner
assured
of
this
;
and
he
assured
himself
so
carefully
that
one
may
almost
say
he
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
to
see
the
better
;
than
he
came
back
at
a
round
trot
,
pounced
upon
him
,
and
summarily
took
off
a
piece
of
his
tail
;
as
a
caution
to
him
to
be
careful
what
he
was
about
for
the
future
,
and
never
to
play
tricks
with
his
family
any
more
.
   
<EOS>
We
found
the
steamboat
in
the
canal
,
waiting
for
the
slow
process
of
getting
through
the
lock
,
and
went
on
board
,
where
we
shortly
afterwards
had
a
new
kind
of
visitor
in
the
person
of
a
certain
Kentucky
Giant
whose
name
is
Porter
,
and
who
is
of
the
moderate
height
of
seven
feet
eight
inches
,
in
his
stockings
.
   
<EOS>
There
never
was
a
race
of
people
who
so
completely
gave
the
lie
to
history
as
these
giants
,
or
whom
all
the
chroniclers
have
so
cruelly
libelled
.
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
roaring
and
ravaging
about
the
world
,
constantly
catering
for
their
cannibal
larders
,
and
perpetually
going
to
market
in
an
unlawful
manner
,
they
are
the
meekest
people
in
any
man
's
acquaintance
:
 
rather
inclining
to
milk
and
vegetable
diet
,
and
bearing
anything
for
a
quiet
life
.
 
<EOS>
So
decidedly
are
amiability
and
mildness
their
characteristics
,
<EOS>
that
I
confess
I
look
upon
that
youth
who
distinguished
himself
by
the
slaughter
of
these
inoffensive
persons
,
as
a
false
-
hearted
brigand
,
who
,
pretending
to
philanthropic
motives
,
was
secretly
influenced
only
by
the
wealth
stored
up
within
their
castles
,
and
the
hope
of
plunder
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
lean
the
more
to
this
opinion
from
finding
that
even
the
historian
of
those
exploits
,
with
all
his
partiality
for
his
hero
,
is
fain
to
admit
that
the
slaughtered
monsters
in
question
were
of
a
very
innocent
and
simple
turn
;
extremely
guileless
and
ready
of
belief
;
lending
a
credulous
ear
to
the
most
improbable
tales
;
suffering
themselves
to
be
easily
entrapped
into
pits
;
and
even
(
as
in
the
case
of
the
Welsh
Giant
)
with
an
excess
of
the
hospitable
politeness
of
a
landlord
,
ripping
themselves
open
,
rather
than
hint
at
the
possibility
of
their
guests
being
versed
in
the
vagabond
arts
of
sleight
-
of
-
hand
and
hocus
-
pocus
.
   
<EOS>
The
Kentucky
Giant
was
but
another
illustration
of
the
truth
of
this
position
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
weakness
in
the
region
of
the
knees
,
and
a
trustfulness
in
his
long
face
,
which
appealed
even
to
five
-
feet
nine
for
encouragement
and
support
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
only
twenty
-
five
years
old
,
he
said
,
and
had
grown
recently
,
for
it
had
been
found
necessary
to
make
an
addition
to
the
legs
of
his
inexpressibles
.
<EOS>
At
fifteen
he
was
a
short
boy
,
and
in
those
days
his
English
father
and
his
Irish
mother
had
rather
snubbed
him
,
as
being
too
small
of
stature
to
sustain
the
credit
of
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
He
added
that
his
health
had
not
been
good
,
though
it
was
better
now
;
but
short
people
are
not
wanting
who
whisper
that
he
drinks
too
hard
.
   
<EOS>
I
understand
he
drives
a
hackney
-
coach
,
though
how
he
does
it
,
unless
he
stands
on
the
footboard
behind
,
and
lies
along
the
roof
upon
his
chest
,
with
his
chin
in
the
box
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
comprehend
.
 
<EOS>
He
brought
his
gun
with
him
,
as
a
curiosity
.
   
<EOS>
Christened
"
The
Little
Rifle
,
"
and
displayed
outside
a
shop
-
window
<EOS>
,
it
would
make
the
fortune
of
any
retail
business
in
Holborn
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
shown
himself
and
talked
a
little
while
,
he
withdrew
with
his
pocket
-
instrument
,
and
went
bobbing
down
the
cabin
,
among
men
of
six
feet
high
and
upwards
,
like
a
light
-
house
walking
among
lamp
-
posts
.
   
<EOS>
Within
a
few
minutes
afterwards
,
we
were
out
of
the
canal
,
and
in
the
Ohio
river
again
.
   
<EOS>
The
arrangements
of
the
boat
were
like
those
of
the
Messenger
,
and
the
passengers
were
of
the
same
order
of
people
.
 
<EOS>
We
fed
at
the
same
times
,
on
the
same
kind
of
viands
,
in
the
same
dull
manner
,
and
with
the
same
observances
.
 
<EOS>
The
company
appeared
to
be
oppressed
by
the
same
tremendous
concealments
,
and
had
as
little
capacity
of
enjoyment
or
light
-
heartedness
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
in
my
life
did
see
such
listless
,
heavy
dulness
as
brooded
over
these
meals
:
 
the
very
recollection
of
it
weighs
me
down
,
and
makes
me
,
for
the
moment
,
wretched
.
 
<EOS>
Reading
and
writing
on
my
knee
,
in
our
little
cabin
,
I
really
dreaded
the
coming
of
the
hour
that
summoned
us
to
table
;
and
was
as
glad
to
escape
from
it
again
,
as
if
it
had
been
a
penance
or
a
punishment
.
 
<EOS>
Healthy
cheerfulness
and
good
spirits
forming
a
part
of
the
banquet
<EOS>
,
I
could
soak
my
crusts
in
the
fountain
with
Le
Sage
's
strolling
player
,
and
revel
in
their
glad
enjoyment
:
 
but
sitting
down
with
so
many
fellow
-
animals
to
ward
off
thirst
and
hunger
as
a
business
;
to
empty
,
each
creature
,
his
Yahoo
's
trough
as
quickly
as
he
can
,
and
then
slink
sullenly
away
;
to
have
these
social
sacraments
stripped
of
everything
but
the
mere
greedy
satisfaction
of
the
natural
cravings
;
goes
so
against
the
grain
with
me
,
that
I
seriously
believe
the
recollection
of
these
funeral
feasts
will
be
a
waking
nightmare
to
me
all
my
life
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
some
relief
in
this
boat
,
too
,
which
there
had
not
been
in
the
other
,
for
the
captain
(
a
blunt
,
good
-
natured
fellow
)
<EOS>
had
his
handsome
wife
with
him
,
who
was
disposed
to
be
lively
and
agreeable
,
as
were
a
few
other
lady
-
passengers
who
had
their
seats
about
us
at
the
same
end
of
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
But
nothing
could
have
made
head
against
the
depressing
influence
of
the
general
body
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
magnetism
of
dulness
in
them
which
would
have
beaten
down
the
most
facetious
companion
that
the
earth
ever
knew
.
 
<EOS>
A
jest
would
have
been
a
crime
,
and
a
smile
would
have
faded
into
a
grinning
horror
.
 
<EOS>
Such
deadly
,
leaden
people
;
such
systematic
plodding
,
weary
,
insupportable
heaviness
;
such
a
mass
of
animated
indigestion
in
respect
of
all
that
was
genial
,
jovial
,
frank
,
social
,
or
hearty
;
never
,
sure
,
was
brought
together
elsewhere
since
the
world
began
.
   
<EOS>
Nor
was
the
scenery
,
as
we
approached
the
junction
of
the
Ohio
and
Mississippi
rivers
,
at
all
inspiriting
in
its
influence
.
 
<EOS>
The
trees
were
stunted
in
their
growth
;
the
banks
were
low
and
flat
;
the
settlements
and
log
cabins
fewer
in
number
:
 
<EOS>
their
inhabitants
more
wan
and
wretched
than
any
we
had
encountered
yet
.
 
<EOS>
No
songs
of
birds
were
in
the
air
,
no
pleasant
scents
,
no
moving
lights
and
shadows
from
swift
passing
clouds
.
 
<EOS>
Hour
after
hour
,
the
changeless
glare
of
the
hot
,
unwinking
sky
,
shone
upon
the
same
monotonous
objects
.
 
<EOS>
Hour
after
hour
,
the
river
rolled
along
,
as
wearily
and
slowly
as
the
time
itself
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
,
upon
the
morning
of
the
third
day
,
we
arrived
at
a
spot
so
much
more
desolate
than
any
we
had
yet
beheld
,
that
the
forlornest
places
we
had
passed
,
were
,
in
comparison
with
it
,
full
of
interest
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
junction
of
the
two
rivers
,
on
ground
so
flat
and
low
and
marshy
,
that
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
it
is
inundated
to
the
house
-
tops
,
lies
a
breeding
-
place
of
fever
,
ague
,
and
death
;
vaunted
in
England
as
a
mine
of
Golden
Hope
,
and
speculated
in
,
on
the
faith
of
monstrous
representations
,
to
many
people
's
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
A
dismal
swamp
,
on
which
the
half
-
built
houses
rot
away
:
 
cleared
here
and
there
for
the
space
of
a
few
yards
;
and
teeming
,
then
,
with
rank
unwholesome
vegetation
,
in
whose
baleful
shade
the
wretched
wanderers
who
are
tempted
hither
,
droop
,
and
die
,
and
lay
their
bones
;
the
hateful
Mississippi
circling
and
eddying
before
it
,
and
turning
off
upon
its
southern
course
a
slimy
monster
hideous
to
behold
;
a
hotbed
of
disease
,
an
ugly
sepulchre
,
a
grave
uncheered
by
any
gleam
of
promise
:
 
a
place
without
one
single
quality
,
in
earth
or
air
or
water
,
to
commend
it
:
 
such
is
this
dismal
Cairo
.
   
<EOS>
But
what
words
shall
describe
the
Mississippi
,
great
father
of
rivers
,
who
(
praise
be
to
Heaven
)
<EOS>
has
no
young
children
like
him
!
<EOS>
An
enormous
ditch
,
sometimes
two
or
three
miles
wide
,
running
liquid
mud
,
six
miles
an
hour
:
 
its
strong
and
frothy
current
choked
and
obstructed
everywhere
by
huge
logs
and
whole
forest
trees
:
 
now
twining
themselves
together
in
great
rafts
,
from
the
interstices
of
which
a
sedgy
,
lazy
foam
works
up
,
to
float
upon
the
water
's
top
;
now
rolling
past
like
monstrous
bodies
,
their
tangled
roots
showing
like
matted
hair
;
now
glancing
singly
by
like
giant
leeches
;
and
now
writhing
round
and
round
in
the
vortex
of
some
small
whirlpool
,
like
wounded
snakes
.
 
<EOS>
The
banks
low
,
the
trees
dwarfish
,
the
marshes
swarming
with
frogs
,
the
wretched
cabins
few
and
far
apart
,
<EOS>
their
inmates
hollow
-
cheeked
and
pale
,
the
weather
very
hot
<EOS>
,
mosquitoes
penetrating
into
every
crack

crevice
of
the

mud

slime
on
everything
:
 
nothing
pleasant
in
its
aspect
,
but
the
harmless
lightning
which
flickers
every
night
upon
the
dark
horizon
.
   
<EOS>
For
two
days
we
toiled
up
this
foul
stream
,
striking
constantly
against
the
floating
timber
,
or
stopping
to
avoid
those
more
dangerous
obstacles
,
the
snags
,
or
sawyers
,
which
are
the
hidden
trunks
of
trees
that
have
their
roots
below
the
tide
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
nights
are
very
dark
,
the
look
-
out
stationed
in
the
head
of
the
boat
,
knows
by
the
ripple
of
the
water
if
any
great
impediment
be
near
at
hand
,
and
rings
a
bell
beside
him
,
which
is
the
signal
for
the
engine
to
be
stopped
:
 
but
always
in
the
night
this
bell
has
work
to
do
,
and
after
every
ring
,
there
comes
a
blow
which
renders
it
no
easy
matter
to
remain
in
bed
.
   
<EOS>
The
decline
of
day
here
was
very
gorgeous
;
tingeing
the
firmament
deeply
with
red
and
gold
,
up
to
the
very
keystone
of
the
arch
above
us
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
sun
went
down
behind
the
bank
,
the
slightest
blades
of
grass
upon
it
seemed
to
become
as
distinctly
visible
as
the
arteries
in
the
skeleton
of
a
leaf
;
and
when
,
as
it
slowly
sank
,
the
red
and
golden
bars
upon
the
water
grew
dimmer
,
and
dimmer
yet
,
as
if
they
were
sinking
too
;
and
all
the
glowing
colours
of
departing
day
paled
,
inch
by
inch
,
before
the
sombre
night
;
the
scene
became
a
thousand
times
more
lonesome
and
more
dreary
than
before
,
and
all
its
influences
darkened
with
the
sky
.
   
<EOS>
We
drank
the
muddy
water
of
this
river
while
we
were
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
considered
wholesome
by
the
natives
,
and
is
something
more
opaque
than
gruel
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
water
like
it
at
the
Filter
-
shops
,
but
nowhere
else
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
fourth
night
after
leaving
Louisville
,
we
reached
St
Louis
,
and
here
I
witnessed
the
conclusion
of
an
incident
,
trifling
enough
in
itself
,
but
very
pleasant
to
see
,
which
had
interested
me
during
the
whole
journey
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
woman
on
board
,
with
a
little
baby
;
and
both
little
woman
and
little
child
were
cheerful
,
good
-
looking
,
bright
-
eyed
,
and
fair
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
woman
had
been
passing
a
long
time
with
her
sick
mother
in
New
York
,
and
had
left
her
home
in
St
Louis
,
in
that
condition
in
which
ladies
who
truly
love
their
lords
desire
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
The
baby
was
born
in
her
mother
's
house
;
and
she
had
not
seen
her
husband
(
to
whom
she
was
now
returning
)
,
for
twelve
months
:
 
having
left
him
a
month
or
two
after
their
marriage
.
   
<EOS>
Well
,
to
be
sure
,
there
never
was
a
little
woman
so
full
of
hope
,
and
tenderness
,
and
love
,
and
anxiety
,
as
this
little
woman
was
:
and
all
day
long
she
wondered
whether
"
He
"
would
be
at
the
wharf
;
and
whether
"
He
"
had
got
her
letter
;
and
whether
,
if
she
sent
the
baby
ashore
by
somebody
else
,
"
He
"
would
know
it
,
meeting
it
in
the
street
:
 
which
,
seeing
that
he
had
never
set
eyes
upon
it
in
his
life
,
was
not
very
likely
in
the
abstract
,
but
was
probable
enough
,
to
the
young
mother
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
such
an
artless
little
creature
;
and
was
in
such
a
sunny
,
beaming
,
hopeful
state
;
and
let
out
all
this
matter
clinging
close
about
her
heart
,
so
freely
;
that
all
the
other
lady
passengers
entered
into
the
spirit
of
it
as
much
as
she
;
and
the
captain
(
who
heard
all
about
it
from
his
wife
)
was
wondrous
sly
<EOS>
,
I
promise
you
:
 
inquiring
,
every
time
we
met
at
table
,
as
in
forgetfulness
,
whether
she
expected
anybody
to
meet
her
at
St
Louis
,
and
whether
she
would
want
to
go
ashore
the
night
we
reached
it
(
but
he
supposed
she
would
n't
)
,
and
cutting
many
other
dry
jokes
of
that
nature
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
one
little
weazen
,
dried
-
apple
-
faced
old
woman
,
who
took
occasion
to
doubt
the
constancy
of
husbands
in
such
circumstances
of
bereavement
;
and
there
was
another
lady
(
with
a
lap
-
dog
)
old
enough
to
moralize
on
the
lightness
of
human
affections
,
and
yet
not
so
old
that
she
could
help
nursing
the
baby
,
now
and
then
,
or
laughing
with
the
rest
,
when
the
little
woman
called
it
by
its
father
's
name
,
and
asked
it
all
manner
of
fantastic
questions
concerning
him
in
the
joy
of
her
heart
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
something
of
a
blow
to
the
little
woman
,
that
when
we
were
within
twenty
miles
of
our
destination
,
it
became
clearly
necessary
to
put
this
baby
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
got
over
it
with
the
same
good
humour
;
tied
a
handkerchief
round
her
head
;
and
came
out
into
the
little
gallery
with
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
such
an
oracle
as
she
became
in
reference
to
the
localities
!
<EOS>
and
such
facetiousness
as
was
displayed
by
the
married
ladies
!
<EOS>
and
such
sympathy
as
was
shown
by
the
single
ones
!
<EOS>
and
such
peals
of
laughter
as
the
little
woman
herself
(
who
would
just
as
soon
have
cried
)
greeted
every
jest
with
!
   
<EOS>
At
last
,
there
were
the
lights
of
St
Louis
,
and
here
was
the
wharf
,
and
those
were
the
steps
:
 
and
the
little
woman
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
,
and
laughing
(
or
seeming
to
laugh
)
more
than
ever
,
ran
into
her
own
cabin
,
and
shut
herself
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
that
in
the
charming
inconsistency
of
such
excitement
,
she
stopped
her
ears
,
lest
she
should
hear
"
Him
"
asking
for
her
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
did
not
see
her
do
it
.
   
<EOS>
Then
,
a
great
crowd
of
people
rushed
on
board
,
though
the
boat
was
not
yet
made
fast
,
but
was
wandering
about
,
among
the
other
boats
,
to
find
a
landing
-
place
:
 
and
everybody
looked
for
the
husband
:
and
nobody
saw
him
:
 
<EOS>
when
,
in
the
midst
of
us
all
---
Heaven
knows
how
she
ever
got
there
---
there
was
the
little
woman
clinging
with
both
arms
<EOS>
tight
round
the
neck
of
a
fine
,
good
-
looking
,
sturdy
young
fellow
!
<EOS>
and
in
a
moment
afterwards
,
there
she
was
again
,
actually
clapping
her
little
hands
for
joy
,
as
she
dragged
him
through
the
small
door
of
her
small
cabin
,
to
look
at
the
baby
as
he
lay
asleep
!
   
<EOS>
We
went
to
a
large
hotel
,
called
the
Planter
's
House
:
 
built
like
an
English
hospital
,
with
long
passages
and
bare
walls
,
and
sky
-
lights
above
the
room
-
doors
for
the
free
circulation
of
air
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
a
great
many
boarders
in
it
;
and
as
many
lights
sparkled
and
glistened
from
the
windows
down
into
the
street
below
,
when
we
drove
up
,
as
if
it
had
been
illuminated
on
some
occasion
of
rejoicing
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
an
excellent
house
,
and
the
proprietors
have
most
bountiful
notions
of
providing
the
creature
comforts
.
 
<EOS>
Dining
alone
with
my
wife
in
our
own
room
,
one
day
,
I
counted
fourteen
dishes
on
the
table
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
old
French
portion
of
the
town
,
the
thoroughfares
are
narrow
and
crooked
,
and
some
of
the
houses
are
very
quaint
and
picturesque
:
 
being
built
of
wood
,
with
tumble
-
down
galleries
before
the
windows
,
approachable
by
stairs
or
rather
ladders
from
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
queer
little
barbers
'
shops
and
drinking
-
houses
too
,
in
this
quarter
;
and
abundance
of
crazy
old
tenements
with
blinking
casements
,
such
as
may
be
seen
in
Flanders
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
these
ancient
habitations
,
with
high
garret
gable
-
windows
perking
into
the
roofs
,
have
a
kind
of
French
shrug
about
them
;
and
being
lop
-
sided
with
age
,
appear
to
hold
their
heads
askew
,
besides
,
as
if
they
were
grimacing
in
astonishment
at
the
American
Improvements
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
,
that
these
consist
of
wharfs
and
warehouses
,
and
new
buildings
in
all
directions
;
and
of
a
great
many
vast
plans
which
are
still
"
progressing
.
"
 
<EOS>
Already
,
however
,
some
very
good
houses
,
broad
streets
,
and
marble
-
fronted
shops
,
have
gone
so
far
ahead
as
to
be
in
a
state
of
completion
;
and
the
town
bids
fair
in
a
few
years
to
improve
considerably
:
 
though
it
is
not
likely
ever
to
vie
,
in
point
of
elegance
or
beauty
,
with
Cincinnati
.
   
<EOS>
The
Roman
Catholic
religion
,
introduced
here
by
the
early
French
settlers
,
prevails
extensively
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
public
institutions
are
a
Jesuit
college
;
a
convent
for
"
the
Ladies
of
the
Sacred
Heart
;
"
and
a
large
chapel
attached
to
the
college
,
which
was
in
course
of
erection
at
the
time
of
my
visit
,
and
was
intended
to
be
consecrated
on
the
second
of
December
in
the
next
year
.
 
<EOS>
The
architect
of
this
building
,
is
one
of
the
reverend
fathers
of
the
school
,
and
the
works
proceed
under
his
sole
direction
.
 
<EOS>
The
organ
will
be
sent
from
Belgium
.
   
<EOS>
In
addition
to
these
establishments
,
there
is
a
Roman
Catholic
cathedral
,
dedicated
to
Saint
Francis
Xavier
;
and
a
hospital
,
founded
by
the
munificence
of
a
deceased
resident
,
who
was
a
member
of
that
church
.
 
<EOS>
It
also
sends
missionaries
from
hence
among
the
Indian
tribes
.
   
<EOS>
The
Unitarian
church
is
represented
,
in
this
remote
place
,
as
in
most
other
parts
of
America
,
by
a
gentleman
of
great
worth
and
excellence
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
have
good
reason
to
remember
and
bless
it
;
for
it
befriends
them
,
and
aids
the
cause
of
rational
education
,
without
any
sectarian
or
selfish
views
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
liberal
in
all
its
actions
;
of
kind
construction
;
and
of
wide
benevolence
.
   
<EOS>
There
are
three
free
-
schools
already
erected
,
and
in
full
operation
in
this
city
.
 
<EOS>
A
fourth
is
building
,
and
will
soon
be
opened
.
   
<EOS>
No
man
ever
admits
the
unhealthiness
of
the
place
he
dwells
in
(
unless
he
is
going
away
from
it
)
,
and
I
shall
therefore
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
be
at
issue
with
the
inhabitants
of
St
Louis
,
in
questioning
the
perfect
salubrity
of
its
climate
,
and
in
hinting
that
I
think
it
must
rather
dispose
to
fever
,
in
the
summer
and
autumnal
seasons
.
 
<EOS>
Just
adding
,
that
it
is
very
hot
,
lies
among
great
rivers
,
and
has
vast
tracts
of
undrained
swampy
land
around
it
,
I
leave
the
reader
to
form
his
own
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
As
I
had
a
great
desire
to
see
a
Prairie
before
turning
back
from
the
furthest
point
of
my
wanderings
;
and
as
some
gentlemen
of
the
town
had
,
in
their
hospitable
consideration
,
an
equal
desire
to
gratify
me
;
a
day
was
fixed
,
before
my
departure
,
for
an
expedition
to
the
Looking
-
Glass
Prairie
,
which
is
within
thirty
miles
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
Deeming
it
possible
that
my
readers
may
not
object
to
know
what
kind
of
thing
such
a
gipsy
party
may
be
at
that
distance
from
home
,
and
among
what
sort
of
objects
it
moves
,
I
will
describe
the
jaunt
in
another
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter

<EOS>
A
Jaunt
to
the
Looking
-
Glass
Prairie
and
Back
 
<EOS>
I
MAY
premise
that
the
word
Prairie
is
variously
pronounced
PARAAER
,
PAREARER
,
PAROARER
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
mode
of
pronunciation
is
perhaps
the
most
in
favour
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
fourteen
in
all
,
and
all
young
men
:
 
<EOS>
indeed
it
is
a
singular
though
very
natural
feature
in
the
society
of
these
distant
settlements
,
that
it
is
mainly
composed
of
adventurous
persons
in
the
prime
of
life
,
and
has
very
few
grey
heads
among
it
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
ladies
:
 
<EOS>
the
trip
being
a
fatiguing
one
:
 
<EOS>
and
we
were
to
start
at
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
punctually
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
called
at
four
,
that
I
might
be
certain
of
keeping
nobody
waiting
;
and
having
got
some
bread
and
milk
for
breakfast
,
threw
up
the
window
and
looked
down
into
the
street
,
expecting
to
see
the
whole
party
busily
astir
,
and
<EOS>
great
preparations
going
on
below
.
<EOS>
But
as
everything
was
very
quiet
,
and
the
street
presented
that
hopeless
aspect
with
which
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
is
familiar
elsewhere
,
I
deemed
it
as
well
to
go
to
bed
again
,
and
went
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
I
woke
again
at
seven
o'clock
,
and
by
that
time
the
party
had
assembled
,
and
were
gathered
round
,
one
light
carriage
,
with
a
very
stout
axletree
;
one
something
on
wheels
like
an
amateur
carrier
's
cart
;
one
double
phaeton
of
great
antiquity
and
unearthly
construction
;
one
gig
with
a
great
hole
in
its
back
and
a
broken
head
;
and
one
rider
on
horseback
who
was
to
go
on
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
into
the
first
coach
with
three
companions
;
the
rest
bestowed
themselves
in
the
other
vehicles
;
two
large
baskets
were
made
fast
to
the
lightest
;
two
large
stone
jars
in
wicker
cases
,
technically
known
as
demi
-
johns
,
were
consigned
to
the
"
least
rowdy
"
of
the
party
for
safe
-
keeping
;
and
the
procession
moved
off
to
the
ferryboat
,
in
which
it
was
to
cross
the
river
bodily
,
men
,
horses
,
carriages
,
and
all
,
as
the
manner
in
these
parts
is
.
   
<EOS>
We
got
over
the
river
in
due
course
,
and
mustered
again
before
a
little
wooden
box
on
wheels
,
hove
down
all
aslant
in
a
morass
,
with
"
MERCHANT
TAILOR
"
painted
in
very
large
letters
over
the
door
.
<EOS>
Having
settled
the
order
of
proceeding
,
and
the
road
to
be
taken
,
we
started
off
once
more
and
began
to
make
our
way
through
an
ill
-
favoured
Black
Hollow
,
called
,
less
expressively
,
the
American
Bottom
.
   
<EOS>
The
previous
day
had
been
---
not
to
say
hot
,
for
the
term
is
weak
and
lukewarm
in
its
power
of
conveying
an
idea
of
the
temperature
.
<EOS>
The
town
had
been
on
fire
;
in
a
blaze
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
night
it
had
come
on
to
rain
in
torrents
,
and
all
night
long
it
had
rained
without
cessation
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
a
pair
of
very
strong
horses
,
but
travelled
at
the
rate
of
little
more
than
a
couple
of
miles
an
hour
,
through
one
unbroken
slough
of
black
mud
and
water
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
no
variety
but
in
depth
.
 
<EOS>
Now
it
was
only
half
over
the
wheels
,
now
it
hid
the
axletree
,
and
now
the
coach
sank
down
in
it
almost
to
the
windows
.
<EOS>
The
air
resounded
in
all
directions
with
the
loud
chirping
of
the
frogs
,
who
,
with
the
pigs
(
a
coarse
,
ugly
breed
,
as
unwholesome
-
looking
as
though
they
were
the
spontaneous
growth
of
the
country
)
,
had
the
whole
scene
to
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Here
<EOS>
and
there
we
passed
a
log
hut
:
 
but
the
wretched
cabins
were
wide
apart
and
thinly
scattered
,
for
though
the
soil
is
very
rich
in
this
place
,
few
people
can
exist
in
such
a
deadly
atmosphere
.
 
<EOS>
On
either
side
of
the
track
,
if
it
deserve
the
name
,
was
the
thick
"
bush
;
"
and
everywhere
was
stagnant
,
slimy
,
rotten
,
filthy
water
.
   
<EOS>
As
it
is
the
custom
in
these
parts
to
give
a
horse
a
gallon
or
so
of
cold
water
whenever
he
is
in
a
foam
with
heat
,
we
halted
for
that
purpose
,
at
a
log
inn
in
the
wood
,
far
removed
from
any
other
residence
.
 
<EOS>
It
consisted
of
one
room
,
bare
-
roofed
and
bare
-
walled
of
course
,
with
a
loft
above
.
 
<EOS>
The
ministering
priest
was
a
swarthy
young
savage
,
in
a
shirt
of
cotton
print
like
bed
-
furniture
,
and
a
pair
of
ragged
trousers
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
a
couple
of
young
boys
,
too
,
nearly
naked
,
lying
idle
by
the
well
;
and
they
,
and
he
,
and
THE
traveller
at
the
inn
,
turned
out
to
look
at
us
.
   
<EOS>
The
traveller
was
an
old
man
with
a
grey
gristly
beard
two
inches
long
,
a
shaggy
moustache
of
the
same
hue
,
and
enormous
eyebrows
;
which
almost
obscured
his
lazy
,
semi
-
drunken
glance
,
as
he
stood
regarding
us
with
folded
arms
:
 
poising
himself
alternately
upon
his
toes
and
heels
.
 
<EOS>
On
being
addressed
by
one
of
the
party
,
he
drew
nearer
,
and
said
,
rubbing
his
chin
(
which
scraped
under
his
horny
hand
like
fresh
gravel
beneath
a
nailed
shoe
)
,
that
he
was
from
Delaware
,
and
had
lately
bought
a
farm
"
down
there
,
"
pointing
into
one
of
the
marshes
where
the
stunted
trees
were
thickest
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
"
going
,
"
he
added
,
to
St
Louis
,
to
fetch
his
family
,
whom
he
had
left
behind
;
but
he
seemed
in
no
great
hurry
to
bring
on
these
incumbrances
,
for
when
we
moved
away
,
he
loitered
back
into
the
cabin
,
and
was
plainly
bent
on
stopping
there
so
long
as
his
money
lasted
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
great
politician
of
course
,
and
explained
his
opinions
at
some
length
to
one
of
our
company
;
but
I
only
remember
that
he
concluded
with
two
sentiments
,
one
of
which
was
,
Somebody
for
ever
;
and
the
other
,
Blast
everybody
else
!
<EOS>
which
is
by
no
means
a
bad
abstract
of
the
general
creed
in
these
matters
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
horses
were
swollen
out
to
about
twice
their
natural
dimensions
<EOS>
(
there
seems
to
be
an
idea
here
,
that
this
kind
of
inflation
improves
their
going
)
,
we
went
forward
again
,
through
mud
and
mire
,
and
damp
,
and
festering
heat
,
and
brake
and
bush
,
attended
always
by
the
music
of
the
frogs
and
pigs
,
until
nearly
noon
,
when
we
halted
at
a
place
called
Belleville
.
   
<EOS>
Belleville
was
a
small
collection
of
wooden
houses
,
huddled
together
in
the
very
heart
of
the
bush
and
swamp
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
them
had
singularly
bright
doors
of
red
and
yellow
;
for
the
place
had
been
lately
visited
by
a
travelling
painter
,
"
who
got
along
,
"
as
I
was
told
,
"
by
eating
his
way
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
criminal
court
was
sitting
,
and
was
at
that
moment
trying
some
criminals
for
horse
-
stealing
:
 
<EOS>
with
whom
it
would
most
likely
go
hard
:
 
for
live
stock
of
all
kinds
being
necessarily
very
much
exposed
in
the
woods
,
is
held
by
the
community
in
rather
higher
value
than
human
life
;
and
for
this
reason
,
juries
generally
make
a
point
of
finding
all
men
indicted
for
cattle
-
stealing
,
guilty
,
whether
or
no
.
   
<EOS>
The
horses
belonging
to
the
bar
,
the
judge
,
and
witnesses
,
were
tied
to
temporary
racks
set
up
roughly
in
the
road
;
by
which
is
to
be
understood
,
a
forest
path
,
nearly
knee
-
deep
in
mud
and
slime
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
an
hotel
in
this
place
,
which
,
like
all
hotels
in
America
,
had
its
large
dining
-
room
for
the
public
table
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
odd
,
shambling
,
low
-
roofed
out
-
house
,
half
-
cowshed
and
half
-
kitchen
,
with
a
coarse
brown
canvas
table
-
cloth
,
and
tin
sconces
stuck
against
the
walls
,
to
hold
candles
at
supper
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
horseman
had
gone
forward
to
have
coffee
and
some
eatables
prepared
,
and
they
were
by
this
time
nearly
ready
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
ordered
"
wheat
-
bread
and
chicken
fixings
,
"
in
preference
to
"
corn
-
bread
and
common
doings
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
latter
kind
of
rejection
includes
only
pork
and
bacon
.
 
<EOS>
The
former
comprehends
broiled
ham
,
sausages
,
veal
cutlets
,
steaks
,
and
such
other
viands
of
that
nature
as
may
be
supposed
,
by
a
tolerably
wide
poetical
construction
,
"
to
fix
"
a
chicken
comfortably
in
the
digestive
organs
of
any
lady
or
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
On
one
of
the
door
-
posts
at
this
inn
,
was
a
tin
plate
,
whereon
was
inscribed
in
characters
of
gold
,
"
Doctor
Crocus
;
"
and
on
a
sheet
of
paper
,
pasted
up
by
the
side
of
this
plate
,
was
a
written
announcement
that
Dr.
Crocus
would
that
evening
deliver
a
lecture
on
Phrenology
for
the
benefit
of
the
Belleville
public
;
at
a
charge
,
for
admission
,
of
so
much
a
head
.
   
<EOS>
Straying
up
-
stairs
,
during
the
preparation
of
the
chicken
fixings
<EOS>
,
I
happened
to
pass
the
doctor
's
chamber
;
and
as
the
door
stood
wide
open
,
and
the
room
was
empty
,
I
made
bold
to
peep
in
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
bare
,
unfurnished
,
comfortless
room
,
with
an
unframed
portrait
hanging
up
at
the
head
of
the
bed
;
a
likeness
,
I
take
it
,
of
the
Doctor
,
for
the
forehead
was
fully
displayed
,
and
great
stress
was
laid
by
the
artist
upon
its
phrenological
developments
.
<EOS>
The
bed
itself
was
covered
with
an
old
patch
-
work
counterpane
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
was
destitute
of
carpet
or
of
curtain
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
damp
fireplace
without
any
stove
,
full
of
wood
ashes
;
a
chair
,
and
a
very
small
table
;
and
on
the
last
-
named
piece
of
furniture
was
displayed
,
in
grand
array
,
the
doctor
's
library
,
consisting
of
some
half
-
dozen
greasy
old
books
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
it
certainly
looked
about
the
last
apartment
on
the
whole
earth
out
of
which
any
man
would
be
likely
to
get
anything
to
do
him
good
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
door
,
as
I
have
said
,
stood
coaxingly
open
,
and
plainly
said
in
conjunction
with
the
chair
,
the
portrait
,
the
table
,
and
the
books
,
"
Walk
in
,
gentlemen
,
walk
in
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
ill
,
gentlemen
,
when
you
may
be
well
in
no
time
.
 
<EOS>
Doctor
Crocus
is
here
,
gentlemen
,
the
celebrated
Dr.
Crocus
!
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Crocus
has
come
all
this
way
to
cure
you
,
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
n't
heard
of
Dr.
Crocus
,
it
's
your
fault
,
gentlemen
,
who
live
a
little
way
out
of
the
world
here
:
 
not
Dr.
Crocus
's
.
 
<EOS>
Walk
in
,
gentlemen
,
walk
in
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
the
passage
below
,
when
I
went
down
-
stairs
again
,
was
Dr.
Crocus
himself
.
 
<EOS>
A
crowd
had
flocked
in
from
the
Court
House
,
and
a
voice
from
among
them
called
out
to
the
landlord
,
"
Colonel
!
<EOS>
introduce
Doctor
Crocus
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dickens
,
"
says
the
colonel
,
"
Doctor
Crocus
.
"
   
<EOS>
Upon
which
Doctor
Crocus
,
who
is
a
tall
,
fine
-
looking
Scotchman
,
but
rather
fierce
and
warlike
in
appearance
for
a
professor
of
the
peaceful
art
of
healing
,
bursts
out
of
the
concourse
with
his
right
arm
extended
,
and
his
chest
thrown
out
as
far
as
it
will
possibly
come
,
and
says
:
   
"
<EOS>
Your
countryman
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
Whereupon
Doctor
Crocus
<EOS>
and
I
shake
hands
;
and
Doctor
Crocus
looks
as
if
I
did
n't
by
any
means
realise
his
expectations
,
which
,
in
a
linen
blouse
,
and
a
great
straw
hat
,
with
a
green
ribbon
,
and
no
gloves
,
and
my
face
and
nose
profusely
ornamented
with
the
stings
of
mosquitoes
and
the
bites
of
bugs
,
it
is
very
likely
I
did
not
.
   
<EOS>
"
Long
in
these
parts
,
sir
?
"
says
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Three
or
four
months
,
sir
,
"
says
the
Doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
of
soon
returning
to
the
old
country
?
"
says
I.
   
Doctor
Crocus
makes
no
verbal
answer
,
but
gives
me
an
imploring
look
,
which
says
so
plainly
"
Will
you
ask
me
that
again
,
a
little
louder
,
if
you
please
?
"
that
I
repeat
the
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
Think
of
soon
returning
to
the
old
country
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
repeats
the
Doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
the
old
country
,
sir
,
"
I
rejoin
.
   
<EOS>
Doctor
Crocus
looks
round
upon
the
crowd
to
observe
the
effect
he
produces
,
rubs
his
hands
,
and
says
,
in
a
very
loud
voice
:
   
"
Not
yet
awhile
,
sir
,
not
yet
.
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
catch
me
at
that
just
yet
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
little
too
fond
of
freedom
for
THAT
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
so
easy
for
a
man
to
tear
himself
from
a
free
country
such
as
this
is
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
None
of
that
till
one
's
obliged
to
do
it
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
Doctor
Crocus
says
these
latter
words
,
he
shakes
his
head
,
knowingly
,
and
laughs
again
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
the
bystanders
shake
their
heads
in
concert
with
the
doctor
,
and
laugh
too
,
and
look
at
each
other
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
A
pretty
bright
and
first
-
rate
sort
of
chap
is
Crocus
!
"
<EOS>
and
unless
I
am
very
much
mistaken
,
a
good
many
people
went
to
the
lecture
that
night
,
who
never
thought
about
phrenology
,
or
about
Doctor
Crocus
either
,
in
all
their
lives
before
.
   
<EOS>
From
Belleville
,
we
went
on
,
through
the
same
desolate
kind
of
waste
,
and
constantly
attended
,
without
the
interval
of
a
moment
,
by
the
same
music
;
until
,
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
we
halted
once
more
at
a
village
called
Lebanon
to
inflate
the
horses
again
,
and
give
them
some
corn
besides
:
 
of
which
they
stood
much
in
need
.
 
<EOS>
Pending
this
ceremony
,
I
walked
into
the
village
,
where
I
met
a
full
-
sized
dwelling
-
house
coming
down
-
hill
at
a
round
trot
,
drawn
by
a
score
or
more
of
oxen
.
   
<EOS>
The
public
-
house
was
so
very
clean
and
good
<EOS>
a
one
,
that
the
managers
of
the
jaunt
resolved
to
return
to
it
and
put
up
there
for
the
night
,
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
This
course
decided
on
,
and
the
horses
being
well
refreshed
,
we
again
pushed
forward
,
and
came
upon
the
Prairie
at
sunset
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
to
say
why
,
or
how
---
though
it
was
possibly
from
having
heard
and
read
so
much
about
it
---
but
the
effect
on
me
was
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
towards
the
setting
sun
,
there
lay
,
stretched
out
before
my
view
,
a
vast
expanse
of
level
ground
;
unbroken
,
save
by
one
thin
line
of
trees
,
which
scarcely
amounted
to
a
scratch
upon
the
great
blank
;
until
it
met
the
glowing
sky
,
wherein
it
seemed
to
dip
:
 
<EOS>
mingling
with
its
rich
colours
,
and
mellowing
in
its
distant
blue
.
 
<EOS>
There
it
lay
,
a
tranquil
sea
or
lake
without
water
,
if
such
a
simile
be
admissible
,
with
the
day
going
down
upon
it
:
 
a
few
birds
wheeling
here
and
there
:
 
and
solitude
and
silence
reigning
paramount
around
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
grass
was
not
yet
high
;
there
were
bare
black
patches
on
the
ground
;
and
the
few
wild
flowers
that
the
eye
could
see
,
were
poor
and
scanty
.
<EOS>
Great
as
the
picture
was
,
its
very
flatness
and
extent
,
which
left
nothing
to
the
imagination
,
tamed
it
down
and
cramped
its
interest
.
<EOS>
I
felt
little
of
that
sense
of
freedom
and
exhilaration
which
a
Scottish
heath
inspires
,
or
even
our
English
downs
awaken
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
lonely
and
wild
,
but
oppressive
in
its
barren
monotony
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
that
in
traversing
the
Prairies
,
I
could
never
abandon
myself
to
the
scene
,
forgetful
of
all
else
;
as
I
should
do
instinctively
,
were
the
heather
underneath
my
feet
,
or
an
iron
-
bound
coast
beyond
;
but
should
often
glance
towards
the
distant
and
frequently
-
receding
line
of
the
horizon
,
and
wish
it
gained
and
passed
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
a
scene
to
be
forgotten
,
but
it
is
scarcely
one
,
I
think
(
at
all
events
,
as
I
saw
it
)
,
to
remember
with
much
pleasure
,
or
to
covet
the
looking
-
on
again
,
in
after
-
life
.
   
<EOS>
We
encamped
near
a
solitary
log
-
house
,
for
the
sake
of
its
water
,
and
dined
upon
the
plain
.
 
<EOS>
The
baskets
contained
roast
fowls
,
buffalo
's
tongue
(
an
exquisite
dainty
,
by
the
way
)
,
ham
,
bread
,
cheese
,
and
butter
;
biscuits
,
champagne
,
sherry
;
lemons
and
sugar
for
punch
;
and
abundance
of
rough
ice
.
 
<EOS>
The
meal
was
delicious
,
and
the
entertainers
were
the
soul
of
kindness
and
good
humour
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
recalled
that
cheerful
party
to
my
pleasant
recollection
since
,
and
shall
not
easily
forget
,
in
junketings
nearer
home
with
friends
of
older
date
,
my
boon
companions
on
the
Prairie
.
   
<EOS>
Returning
to
Lebanon
that
night
,
we
lay
at
the
little
inn
at
which
we
had
halted
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
In
point
of
cleanliness
and
comfort
it
would
have
suffered
by
no
comparison
with
any
English
alehouse
,
of
a
homely
kind
,
in
England
.
   
<EOS>
Rising
at
five
o'clock
next
morning
,
I
took
a
walk
about
the
village
:
 
none
of
the
houses
were
strolling
about
to
-
day
,
but
it
was
early
for
them
yet
,
perhaps
:
 
and
then
amused
myself
by
lounging
in
a
kind
of
farm
-
yard
behind
the
tavern
,
of
which
the
leading
features
were
,
a
strange
jumble
of
rough
sheds
for
stables
;
a
rude
colonnade
,
built
as
a
cool
place
of
summer
resort
;
a
deep
well
;
a
great
earthen
mound
for
keeping
vegetables
in
,
in
winter
time
;
and
a
pigeon
-
house
,
whose
little
apertures
looked
,
as
they
do
in
all
pigeon
-
houses
,
very
much
too
small
for
the
admission
of
the
plump
and
swelling
-
breasted
birds
who
were
strutting
about
it
,
though
they
tried
to
get
in
never
so
hard
.
 
<EOS>
That
interest
exhausted
<EOS>
,
I
took
a
survey
of
the
inn
's
two
parlours
,
which
were
decorated
with
coloured
prints
of
Washington
,
and
President
Madison
,
and
of
a
white
-
faced
young
lady
(
much
speckled
by
the
flies
)
,
who
held
up
her
gold
neck
-
chain
for
the
admiration
of
the
spectator
,
and
informed
all
admiring
comers
that
she
was
"
Just
Seventeen
:
"
although
I
should
have
thought
her
older
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
best
room
were
two
oil
portraits
of
the
kit
-
cat
size
,
representing
the
landlord
and
his
infant
son
;
both
looking
as
bold
as
lions
,
and
staring
out
of
the
canvas
with
an
intensity
that
would
have
been
cheap
at
any
price
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
painted
,
I
think
,
by
the
artist
who
had
touched
up
the
Belleville
doors
with
red
and
gold
;
for
I
seemed
to
recognise
his
style
immediately
.
   
<EOS>
After
breakfast
,
we
started
to
return
by
a
different
way
from
that
which
we
had
taken
yesterday
,
and
coming
up
at
ten
o'clock
with
an
encampment
of
German
emigrants
carrying
their
goods
in
carts
,
who
had
made
a
rousing
fire
which
they
were
just
quitting
,
stopped
there
to
refresh
.
 
<EOS>
And
very
pleasant
the
fire
was
;
for
,
hot
though
it
had
been
yesterday
,
it
was
quite
cold
to
-
day
,
and
the
wind
blew
keenly
.
 
<EOS>
Looming
in
the
distance
,
as
we
rode
along
,
was
another
of
the
ancient
Indian
burial
-
places
,
called
The
Monks
'
Mound
;
in
memory
of
a
body
of
fanatics
of
the
order
of
La
Trappe
,
who
founded
a
desolate
convent
there
,
many
years
ago
,
when
there
were
no
settlers
within
a
thousand
miles
,
and
were
all
swept
off
by
the
pernicious
climate
:
 
in
which
lamentable
fatality
,
few
rational
people
will
suppose
,
perhaps
,
that
society
experienced
any
very
severe
deprivation
.
   
<EOS>
The
track
of
to
-
day
had
the
same
features
as
the
track
of
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
swamp
,
the
bush
,
and
the
perpetual
chorus
of
frogs
,
the
rank
unseemly
growth
,
the
unwholesome
steaming
earth
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
,
and
frequently
too
,
we
encountered
a
solitary
broken
-
down
waggon
,
full
of
some
new
settler
's
goods
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
pitiful
sight
to
see
one
of
these
vehicles
deep
in
the
mire
;
the
axle
-
tree
broken
;
the
wheel
lying
idly
by
its
side
;
the
man
gone
miles
away
,
to
look
for
assistance
;
the
woman
seated
among
their
wandering
household
gods
with
a
baby
at
her
breast
,
a
picture
of
forlorn
,
dejected
patience
;
the
team
of
oxen
crouching
down
mournfully
in
the
mud
,
and
breathing
forth
such
clouds
of
vapour
from
their
mouths
and
nostrils
,
that
all
the
damp
mist
and
fog
around
seemed
to
have
come
direct
from
them
.
   
<EOS>
In
due
time
we
mustered
once
again
before
the
merchant
tailor
's
,
and
having
done
so
,
crossed
over
to
the
city
in
the
ferry
-
boat
:
passing
,
on
the
way
,
a
spot
called
Bloody
Island
,
the
duelling
-
ground
of
St
Louis
,
and
so
designated
in
honour
of
the
last
fatal
combat
fought
there
,
which
was
with
pistols
,
breast
to
breast
.
<EOS>
Both
combatants
fell
dead
upon
the
ground
;
and
possibly
some
rational
people
may
think
of
them
,
as
of
the
gloomy
madmen
on
the
Monks
'
Mound
,
that
they
were
no
great
loss
to
the
community
.

A
Stage
-
Coach
Ride
from
That
City
to
Columbus
,
and
Thence
to
Sandusky
.
<EOS>
So
,
by
Lake
Erie
,
to
the
Falls
of
Niagara
 
<EOS>
AS
<EOS>
I
had
a
desire
to
travel
through
the
interior
of
the
state
of
Ohio
,
and
to
"
strike
the
lakes
,
"
as
the
phrase
is
,
at
a
small
town
called
Sandusky
,
to
which
that
route
would
conduct
us
on
our
way
to
Niagara
<EOS>
,
we
had
to
return
from
St
Louis
by
the
way
we
had
come
,
and
to
retrace
our
former
track
as
far
as
Cincinnati
.
   
<EOS>
The
day
on
which
we
were
to
take
leave
of
St
Louis
being
very
fine
;
and
the
steamboat
,
which
was
to
have
started
I
do
n't
know
how
early
in
the
morning
,
postponing
,
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
,
her
departure
until
the
afternoon
;
we
rode
forward
to
an
old
French
village
on
the
river
,
called
properly
Carondelet
,
and
nicknamed
Vide
Poche
,
and
arranged
that
the
packet
should
call
for
us
there
.
   
<EOS>
The
place
consisted
of
a
few
poor
cottages
,
and
two
or
three
public
-
houses
;
the
state
of
whose
larders
certainly
seemed
to
justify
the
second
designation
of
the
village
,
for
there
was
nothing
to
eat
in
any
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
by
going
back
some
half
a
mile
or
so
,
we
found
a
solitary
house
where
ham
and
coffee
were
procurable
;
and
there
we
tarried
to
wait
the
advent
of
the
boat
,
which
would
come
in
sight
from
the
green
before
the
door
,
a
long
way
off
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
neat
,
unpretending
village
tavern
,
and
we
took
our
repast
in
a
quaint
little
room
with
a
bed
in
it
,
decorated
with
some
old
oil
paintings
,
which
in
their
time
had
probably
done
duty
in
a
Catholic
chapel
or
monastery
.
 
<EOS>
The
fare
was
very
good
,
and
served
with
great
cleanliness
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
was
kept
by
a
characteristic
old
couple
,
with
whom
we
had
a
long
talk
,
and
who
were
perhaps
a
very
good
sample
of
that
kind
of
people
in
the
West
.
   
<EOS>
The
landlord
was
a
dry
,
tough
,
hard
-
faced
old
fellow
(
not
so
very
old
either
,
for
he
was
but
just
turned
sixty
,
I
should
think
)
,
who
had
been
out
with
the
militia
in
the
last
war
with
England
,
and
had
seen
all
kinds
of
service
,
---
except
a
battle
;
and
he
had
been
very
near
seeing
that
,
he
added
:
 
very
near
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
all
his
life
been
restless
and
locomotive
,
with
an
irresistible
desire
for
change
;
and
was
still
the
son
of
his
old
self
:
 
for
if
he
had
nothing
to
keep
him
at
home
,
he
said
(
slightly
jerking
his
hat
and
his
thumb
towards
the
window
of
the
room
in
which
the
old
lady
sat
,
as
we
stood
talking
in
front
of
the
house
)
,
he
would
clean
up
his
musket
,
and
be
off
to
Texas
to
-
morrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
one
of
the
very
many
descendants
of
Cain
proper
to
this
continent
,
who
seem
destined
from
their
birth
to
serve
as
pioneers
in
the
great
human
army
:
 
who
gladly
go
on
from
year
to
year
extending
its
outposts
,
and
leaving
home
after
home
behind
them
;
and
die
at
last
,
utterly
regardless
of
their
graves
being
left
thousands
of
miles
behind
,
by
the
wandering
generation
who
succeed
.
   
<EOS>
His
wife
was
a
domesticated
,
kind
-
hearted
old
soul
,
who
had
come
with
him
,
"
from
the
queen
city
of
the
world
,
"
which
,
it
seemed
,
was
Philadelphia
;
but
had
no
love
for
this
Western
country
,
and
indeed
had
little
reason
to
bear
it
any
;
having
seen
her
children
,
one
by
one
,
die
here
of
fever
,
in
the
full
prime
and
beauty
of
their
youth
.
 
<EOS>
Her
heart
was
sore
,
she
said
,
to
think
of
them
;
and
to
talk
on
this
theme
,
even
to
strangers
,
in
that
blighted
place
,
so
far
from
her
old
home
,
eased
it
somewhat
,
and
became
a
melancholy
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
The
boat
appearing
towards
evening
,
we
bade
adieu
to
the
poor
old
lady
and
her
vagrant
spouse
,
and
making
for
the
nearest
landing
-
place
,
were
soon
on
board
The
Messenger
again
,
in
our
old
cabin
,
and
steaming
down
the
Mississippi
.
   
<EOS>
If
the
coming
up
this
river
,
slowly
making
head
against
the
stream
,
be
an
irksome
journey
,
the
shooting
down
it
with
the
turbid
current
is
almost
worse
;
for
then
the
boat
,
proceeding
at
the
rate
of
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
an
hour
,
has
to
force
its
passage
through
a
labyrinth
of
floating
logs
,
which
,
in
the
dark
,
it
is
often
impossible
to
see
beforehand
or
avoid
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
night
,
the
bell
was
never
silent
for
five
minutes
at
a
time
;
and
after
every
ring
the
vessel
reeled
again
,
sometimes
beneath
a
single
blow
,
sometimes
beneath
a
dozen
dealt
in
quick
succession
,
the
lightest
of
which
seemed
more
than
enough
to
beat
in
her
frail
keel
,
as
though
it
had
been
pie
-
crust
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
down
upon
the
filthy
river
after
dark
,
it
seemed
to
be
alive
with
monsters
,
as
these
black
masses
rolled
upon
the
surface
,
or
came
starting
up
again
,
head
first
,
when
the
boat
,
in
ploughing
her
way
among
a
shoal
of
such
obstructions
,
drove
a
few
among
them
for
the
moment
under
water
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
the
engine
stopped
during
a
long
interval
,
and
then
before
her
and
behind
,
and
gathering
close
about
her
on
all
sides
,
were
so
many
of
these
ill
-
favoured
obstacles
that
she
was
fairly
hemmed
in
;
the
centre
of
a
floating
island
;
and
was
constrained
to
pause
until
they
parted
,
somewhere
,
as
dark
clouds
will
do
before
the
wind
,
and
opened
by
degrees
a
channel
out
.
   
<EOS>
In
good
time
next
morning
,
however
,
we
came
again
in
sight
of
the
detestable
morass
called
Cairo
;
and
stopping
there
to
take
in
wood
,
lay
alongside
a
barge
,
whose
starting
timbers
scarcely
held
together
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
moored
to
the
bank
,
and
on
its
side
was
painted
"
Coffee
House
;
"
that
being
,
I
suppose
,
the
floating
paradise
to
which
the
people
fly
for
shelter
when
they
lose
their
houses
for
a
month
or
two
beneath
the
hideous
waters
of
the
Mississippi
.
 
<EOS>
But
looking
southward
from
this
point
,
we
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
that
intolerable
river
dragging
its
slimy
length
and
ugly
freight
abruptly
off
towards
New
Orleans
;
and
passing
a
yellow
line
which
stretched
across
the
current
,
were
again
upon
the
clear
Ohio
,
never
,
I
trust
,
to
see
the
Mississippi
more
,
saving
in
troubled
dreams
and
nightmares
.
 
<EOS>
Leaving
it
for
the
company
of
its
sparkling
neighbour
,
was
like
the
transition
from
pain
to
ease
,
or
the
awakening
from
a
horrible
vision
to
cheerful
realities
.
   
<EOS>
We
arrived
at
Louisville
on
the
fourth
night
,
and
gladly
availed
ourselves
of
its
excellent
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
we
went
on
in
the
Ben
Franklin
,
a
beautiful
mail
steamboat
,
and
reached
Cincinnati
shortly
after
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
Being
by
this
time
nearly
tired
of
sleeping
upon
shelves
,
we
had
remained
awake
to
go
ashore
straightway
;
and
groping
a
passage
across
the
dark
decks
of
other
boats
,
and
among
labyrinths
of
engine
-
machinery
and
leaking
casks
of
molasses
,
we
reached
the
streets
,
knocked
up
the
porter
at
the
hotel
where
we
had
stayed
before
,
and
were
,
to
our
great
joy
,
safely
housed
soon
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
We
rested
but
one
day
at
Cincinnati
,
and
then
resumed
our
journey
to
Sandusky
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
comprised
two
varieties
of
stage
-
coach
travelling
,
which
,
with
those
I
have
already
glanced
at
,
comprehend
the
main
characteristics
of
this
mode
of
transit
in
America
,
I
will
take
the
reader
as
our
fellow
-
passenger
,
and
pledge
myself
to
perform
the
distance
with
all
possible
despatch
.
   
<EOS>
Our
place
of
destination
in
the
first
instance
is
Columbus
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
distant
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
from
Cincinnati
,
but
there
is
a
macadamised
road
(
rare
blessing
!
)
<EOS>
the
whole
way
,
and
the
rate
of
travelling
upon
it
is
six
miles
an
hour
.
   
<EOS>
We
start
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
in
a
great
mail
-
coach
,
whose
huge
cheeks
are
so
very
ruddy
and
plethoric
,
that
it
appears
to
be
troubled
with
a
tendency
of
blood
to
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
Dropsical
it
certainly
is
,
for
it
will
hold
a
dozen
passengers
inside
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
wonderful
to
add
,
it
is
very
clean
and
bright
,
being
nearly
new
;
and
rattles
through
the
streets
of
Cincinnati
gaily
.
   
<EOS>
Our
way
lies
through
a
beautiful
country
,
richly
cultivated
,
and
luxuriant
in
its
promise
of
an
abundant
harvest
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
we
pass
a
field
where
the
strong
bristling
stalks
of
Indian
corn
look
like
a
crop
of
walking
-
sticks
,
and
sometimes
an
enclosure
where
the
green
wheat
is
springing
up
among
a
labyrinth
of
stumps
;
the
primitive
worm
-
fence
is
universal
,
and
an
ugly
thing
it
is
;
but
the
farms
are
neatly
kept
,
and
,
save
for
these
differences
,
one
might
be
travelling
just
now
in
Kent
.
   
<EOS>
We
often
stop
to
water
at
a
roadside
inn
,
which
is
always
dull
and
silent
.
 
<EOS>
The
coachman
dismounts
and
fills
his
bucket
,
and
holds
it
to
the
horses
'
heads
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
scarcely
ever
any
one
to
help
him
;
there
are
seldom
any
loungers
standing
round
;
and
never
any
stable
-
company
with
jokes
to
crack
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
when
we
have
changed
our
team
,
there
is
a
difficulty
in
starting
again
,
arising
out
of
the
prevalent
mode
of
breaking
a
young
horse
:
 
which
is
to
catch
him
,
harness
him
against
his
will
,
and
put
him
in
a
stage
-
coach
without
further
notice
:
 
<EOS>
but
we
get
on
somehow
or
other
,
after
a
great
many
kicks
and
a
violent
struggle
;
and
jog
on
as
before
again
.
   
<EOS>
Occasionally
,
when
we
stop
to
change
,
some
two
or
three
half
-
drunken
loafers
will
come
loitering
out
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
,
or
will
be
seen
kicking
their
heels
in
rocking
-
chairs
,
or
lounging
on
the
window
-
sill
,
or
sitting
on
a
rail
within
the
colonnade
:
 
they
have
not
often
anything
to
say
though
,
either
to
us
or
to
each
other
,
but
sit
there
idly
staring
at
the
coach
and
horses
.
 
<EOS>
The
landlord
of
the
inn
is
usually
among
them
,
and
seems
,
of
all
the
party
,
to
be
the
least
connected
with
the
business
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
he
is
with
reference
to
the
tavern
,
what
the
driver
is
in
relation
to
the
coach
and
passengers
:
 
<EOS>
whatever
happens
in
his
sphere
of
action
,
he
is
quite
indifferent
,
and
perfectly
easy
in
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
The
frequent
change
of
coachmen
works
no
change
or
variety
in
the
coachman
's
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
always
dirty
,
sullen
,
and
taciturn
.
<EOS>
If
he
be
capable
of
smartness
of
any
kind
,
moral
or
physical
,
he
has
a
faculty
of
concealing
it
which
is
truly
marvellous
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
speaks
to
you
as
you
sit
beside
him
on
the
box
,
and
if
you
speak
to
him
,
he
answers
(
if
at
all
)
in
monosyllables
.
 
<EOS>
He
points
out
nothing
on
the
road
,
and
seldom
looks
at
anything
:
 
<EOS>
being
,
to
all
appearance
,
thoroughly
weary
of
it
and
of
existence
generally
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
doing
the
honours
of
his
coach
,
his
business
,
as
I
have
said
,
is
with
the
horses
.
 
<EOS>
The
coach
follows
because
it
is
attached
to
them
and
goes
on
wheels
:
 
not
because
you
are
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
towards
the
end
of
a
long
stage
,
he
suddenly
breaks
out
into
a
discordant
fragment
of
an
election
song
,
but
his
face
never
sings
along
with
him
:
 
<EOS>
it
is
only
his
voice
,
and
not
often
that
.
   
<EOS>
He
always
chews
and
always
spits
,
and
never
encumbers
himself
with
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
The
consequences
to
the
box
passenger
,
especially
when
the
wind
blows
towards
him
,
are
not
agreeable
.
   
<EOS>
Whenever
the
coach
stops
,
and
you
can
hear
the
voices
of
the
inside
passengers
;
or
whenever
any
bystander
addresses
them
,
or
any
one
among
them
;
or
they
address
each
other
;
you
will
hear
one
phrase
repeated
over
and
over
and
over
again
to
the
most
extraordinary
extent
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
an
ordinary
and
unpromising
phrase
enough
,
being
neither
more
nor
less
than
"
Yes
,
sir
;
"
but
it
is
adapted
to
every
variety
of
circumstance
,
and
fills
up
every
pause
in
the
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
:
---
The
time
is
one
o'clock
at
noon
.
 
<EOS>
The
scene
,
a
place
where
we
are
to
stay
and
dine
,
on
this
journey
.
 
<EOS>
The
coach
drives
up
to
the
door
of
an
inn
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
is
warm
,
and
there
are
several
idlers
lingering
about
the
tavern
,
and
waiting
for
the
public
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Among
them
,
is
a
stout
gentleman
in
a
brown
hat
,
swinging
himself
to
and
fro
in
a
rocking
-
chair
on
the
pavement
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
coach
stops
,
a
gentleman
in
a
straw
hat
looks
out
of
the
window
:
  
STRAW
HAT.(To
the
stout
gentleman
in
the
rocking
-
chair
.
)
 
<EOS>
I
reckon
that
's
Judge
Jefferson
,
an't
it
?
   
<EOS>
BROWN
HAT.(Still
swinging
;
speaking
very
slowly
;
and
without
any
emotion
whatever
.
)
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
   
<EOS>
STRAW
HAT
.
 
<EOS>
Warm
weather
,
Judge
.
   
<EOS>
BROWN
HAT
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
   
<EOS>
STRAW
HAT
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
snap
of
cold
,
last
week
.
   
<EOS>
BROWN
HAT
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
   
<EOS>
STRAW
HAT
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
    
<EOS>
A
pause
.
 
<EOS>
They
look
at
each
other
,
very
seriously
.
  
<EOS>
STRAW
HAT
.
 
<EOS>
I
calculate
you
'll
have
got
through
that
case
of
the
corporation
,
Judge
,
by
this
time
,
now
?
   
<EOS>
BROWN
HAT
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
   
<EOS>
STRAW
HAT
.
 
<EOS>
How
did
the
verdict
go
,
sir
?
   
<EOS>
BROWN
HAT
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
defendant
,
sir
.
   
<EOS>
STRAW
HAT.(Interrogatively
.
)
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
?
   
<EOS>
BROWN
HAT.(Affirmatively
.
)
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
   
<EOS>
BOTH.(Musingly
,
as
each
gazes
down
the
street
.
)
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
    
<EOS>
Another
pause
.
 
<EOS>
They
look
at
each
other
again
,
still
more
seriously
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
BROWN
HAT
.
 
<EOS>
This
coach
is
rather
behind
its
time
to
-
day
,
I
guess
.
   
<EOS>
STRAW
HAT.(Doubtingly
.
)
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
   
<EOS>
BROWN
HAT.(Looking
at
his
watch
.
)
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
;
nigh
upon
two
hours
.
   
<EOS>
STRAW
HAT.(Raising
his
eyebrows
in
very
great
surprise
.
)
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
!
   
<EOS>
BROWN
HAT.(Decisively
,
as
he
puts
up
his
watch
.
)
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
   
<EOS>
ALL
THE
OTHER
INSIDE
PASSENGERS.(Among
themselves
.
)
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
   
<EOS>
COACHMAN.(In
a
very
surly
tone
.
)
 
<EOS>
No
it
an't
.
   
<EOS>
STRAW
HAT.(To
the
coachman
.
)
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
a
pretty
tall
time
coming
that
last
fifteen
mile
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
a
fact
.
    
<EOS>
The
coachman
making
no
reply
,
and
plainly
declining
to
enter
into
any
controversy
on
a
subject
so
far
removed
from
his
sympathies
and
feelings
,
another
passenger
says
,
"
Yes
,
sir
;
"
and
the
gentleman
in
the
straw
hat
in
acknowledgment
of
his
courtesy
,
says
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
"
to
him
,
in
return
.
 
<EOS>
The
straw
hat
then
inquires
of
the
brown
hat
,
whether
that
coach
in
which
he
(
the
straw
hat
)
then
sits
,
is
not
a
new
one
?
 
<EOS>
To
which
the
brown
hat
again
makes
answer
,
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
STRAW
HAT
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
so
.
 
<EOS>
Pretty
loud
smell
of
varnish
,
sir
?
   
<EOS>
BROWN
HAT
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
   
<EOS>
ALL
THE
OTHER
INSIDE
PASSENGERS
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
   
<EOS>
BROWN
HAT.(To
the
company
in
general
.
)
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
    
<EOS>
The
conversational
powers
of
the
company
having
been
by
this
time
pretty
heavily
taxed
,
the
straw
hat
opens
the
door
and
gets
out
;
and
<EOS>
all
the
rest
alight
also
.
 
<EOS>
We
dine
soon
afterwards
with
the
boarders
in
the
house
,
and
have
nothing
to
drink
but
tea
and
coffee
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
are
both
very
bad
and
the
water
is
worse
,
I
ask
for
brandy
;
but
it
is
a
Temperance
Hotel
,
and
spirits
are
not
to
be
had
for
love
or
money
.
 
<EOS>
This
preposterous
forcing
of
unpleasant
drinks
down
the
reluctant
throats
of
travellers
is
not
at
all
uncommon
in
America
,
but
I
never
discovered
that
the
scruples
of
such
wincing
landlords
induced
them
to
preserve
any
unusually
nice
balance
between
the
quality
of
their
fare
,
and
their
scale
of
charges
:
 
on
the
contrary
,
I
rather
suspected
them
of
diminishing
the
one
and
exalting
the
other
,
by
way
of
recompense
for
the
loss
of
their
profit
on
the
sale
of
spirituous
liquors
.
 
<EOS>
After
all
,
perhaps
,
the
plainest
course
for
persons
of
such
tender
consciences
,
would
be
,
a
total
abstinence
from
tavern
-
keeping
.
   
<EOS>
Dinner
over
,
we
get
into
another
vehicle
which
is
ready
at
the
door
(
for
the
coach
has
been
changed
in
the
interval
)
,
and
resume
our
journey
;
which
continues
through
the
same
kind
of
country
until
evening
,
when
we
come
to
the
town
where
we
are
to
stop
for
tea
and
supper
;
and
having
delivered
the
mail
bags
at
the
Post
-
office
,
ride
through
the
usual
wide
street
,
lined
with
the
usual
stores
and
houses
(
the
drapers
always
having
hung
up
at
their
door
,
by
way
of
sign
,
a
piece
of
bright
red
cloth
)
,
to
the
hotel
where
this
meal
is
prepared
.
 
<EOS>
There
being
many
boarders
here
,
we
sit
down
,
a
large
party
,
and
a
very
melancholy
one
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
is
a
buxom
hostess
at
the
head
of
the
table
,
and
<EOS>
opposite
,
a
simple
Welsh
schoolmaster
with
his
wife
and
child
;
who
came
here
,
on
a
speculation
of
greater
promise
than
performance
,
to
teach
the
classics
:
 
and
they
are
sufficient
subjects
of
interest
until
the
meal
is
over
,
and
another
coach
is
ready
.
 
<EOS>
In
it
we
go
on
once
more
,
lighted
by
a
bright
moon
,
until
midnight
;
when
we
stop
to
change
the
coach
again
,
and
remain
for
half
an
hour
or
so
in
a
miserable
room
,
with
a
blurred
lithograph
of
Washington
over
the
smoky
fire
-
place
,
and
a
mighty
jug
of
cold
water
on
the
table
:
 
to
which
refreshment
<EOS>
the
moody
passengers
do
so
apply
themselves
that
they
would
seem
to
be
,
one
and
all
,
keen
patients
of
Dr.
Sangrado
.
<EOS>
Among
them
is
a
very
little
boy
,
who
chews
tobacco
like
a
very
big
one
;
and
a
droning
gentleman
,
who
talks
arithmetically
and
statistically
on
all
subjects
,
from
poetry
downwards
;
and
who
always
speaks
in
the
same
key
,
with
exactly
the
same
emphasis
,
and
with
very
grave
deliberation
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
outside
just
now
,
and
told
me
how
that
the
uncle
of
a
certain
young
lady
who
had
been
spirited
away
and
married
by
a
certain
captain
,
lived
in
these
parts
;
and
how
this
uncle
was
so
valiant
and
ferocious
that
he
should
n't
wonder
if
he
were
to
follow
the
said
captain
to
England
,
"
and
shoot
him
down
in
the
street
wherever
he
found
him
;
"
in
the
feasibility
of
which
strong
measure
<EOS>
I
,
being
for
the
moment
rather
prone
to
contradiction
,
from
feeling
half
asleep
and
very
tired
,
declined
to
acquiesce
:
 
assuring
him
that
if
the
uncle
did
resort
to
it
,
or
gratified
any
other
little
whim
of
the
like
nature
,
he
would
find
himself
one
morning
prematurely
throttled
at
the
Old
Bailey
:
 
and
that
he
would
do
well
to
make
his
will
before
he
went
,
as
he
would
certainly
want
it
before
he
had
been
in
Britain
very
long
.
   
<EOS>
On
we
go
,
all
night
,
and
by
-
and
-
by
the
day
begins
to
break
,
and
presently
the
first
cheerful
rays
of
the
warm
sun
come
slanting
on
us
brightly
.
 
<EOS>
It
sheds
its
light
upon
a
miserable
waste
of
sodden
grass
,
and
dull
trees
,
and
squalid
huts
,
whose
aspect
is
forlorn
and
grievous
in
the
last
degree
.
 
<EOS>
A
very
desert
in
the
wood
,
<EOS>
whose
growth
of
green
is
dank
and
noxious
like
that
upon
the
top
of
standing
water
:
 
where
poisonous
fungus
grows
in
the
rare
footprint
on
the
oozy
ground
,
and
sprouts
like
witches
'
coral
,
from
the
crevices
in
the
cabin
wall
and
floor
;
it
is
a
hideous
thing
to
lie
upon
the
very
threshold
of
a
city
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
purchased
years
ago
,
and
as
the
owner
can
not
be
discovered
,
the
State
has
been
unable
to
reclaim
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
there
it
remains
,
in
the
midst
of
cultivation
and
improvement
,
like
ground
accursed
,
and
made
obscene
and
rank
by
some
great
crime
.
   
<EOS>
We
reached
Columbus
shortly
before
seven
o'clock
,
and
stayed
there
,
to
refresh
,
that
day
and
night
:
 
having
excellent
apartments
in
a
very
large
unfinished
hotel
called
the
Neill
House
,
which
were
richly
fitted
with
the
polished
wood
of
the
black
walnut
,
and
opened
on
a
handsome
portico
and
stone
verandah
,
like
rooms
in
some
Italian
mansion
.
 
<EOS>
The
town
is
clean
and
pretty
,
and
of
course
is
"
going
to
be
"
much
larger
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
seat
of
the
State
legislature
of
Ohio
,
and
lays
claim
,
in
consequence
,
to
some
consideration
and
importance
.
   
<EOS>
There
being
no
stage
-
coach
next
day
,
upon
the
road
we
wished
to
take
,
I
hired
"
an
extra
,
"
at
a
reasonable
charge
to
carry
us
to
Tiffin
;
a
small
town
from
whence
<EOS>
there
is
a
railroad
to
Sandusky
.
<EOS>
This
extra
was
an
ordinary
four
-
horse
stage
-
coach
,
such
as
I
have
described
,
changing
horses
and
drivers
,
as
the
stage
-
coach
would
,
but
was
exclusively
our
own
for
the
journey
.
 
<EOS>
To
ensure
our
having
horses
at
the
proper
stations
,
and
being
incommoded
by
no
strangers
,
the
proprietors
sent
an
agent
on
the
box
,
who
was
to
accompany
us
the
whole
way
through
;
and
thus
attended
,
and
bearing
with
us
,
besides
,
a
hamper
full
of
savoury
cold
meats
,
and
fruit
,
and
wine
,
we
started
off
again
in
high
spirits
,
at
half
-
past
six
o'clock
next
morning
,
very
much
delighted
to
be
by
ourselves
,
and
disposed
to
enjoy
even
the
roughest
journey
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
well
for
us
,
that
we
were
in
this
humour
,
for
the
road
we
went
over
that
day
,
was
certainly
enough
to
have
shaken
tempers
that
were
not
resolutely
at
Set
Fair
,
down
to
some
inches
below
Stormy
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
time
we
were
all
flung
together
in
a
heap
at
the
bottom
of
the
coach
,
and
at
another
we
were
crushing
our
heads
against
the
roof
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
one
side
was
down
deep
in
the
mire
,
and
we
were
holding
on
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
the
coach
was
lying
on
the
tails
of
the
two
wheelers
;
and
now
it
was
rearing
up
in
the
air
,
in
a
frantic
state
,
with
all
four
horses
standing
on
the
top
of
an
insurmountable
eminence
,
looking
coolly
back
at
it
,
as
though
they
would
say
"
Unharness
us
.
 
<EOS>
It
ca
n't
be
done
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
drivers
on
these
roads
,
who
certainly
get
over
the
ground
in
a
manner
which
is
quite
miraculous
,
so
twist
and
turn
the
team
about
in
forcing
a
passage
,
corkscrew
fashion
,
through
the
bogs
and
swamps
,
that
it
was
quite
a
common
circumstance
on
looking
out
of
the
window
,
to
see
the
coachman
with
the
ends
of
a
pair
of
reins
in
his
hands
,
apparently
driving
nothing
,
or
playing
at
horses
,
and
<EOS>
the
leaders
staring
at
one
unexpectedly
from
the
back
of
the
coach
,
as
if
they
had
some
idea
of
getting
up
behind
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
portion
of
the
way
was
over
what
is
called
a
corduroy
road
,
which
is
made
by
throwing
trunks
of
trees
into
a
marsh
,
and
leaving
them
to
settle
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
slightest
of
the
jolts
with
which
the
ponderous
carriage
fell
from
log
to
log
,
was
enough
,
it
seemed
,
to
have
dislocated
all
the
bones
in
the
human
body
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
impossible
to
experience
a
similar
set
of
sensations
,
in
any
other
circumstances
,
unless
perhaps
in
attempting
to
go
up
to
the
top
of
St
Paul
's
in
an
omnibus
.
 
<EOS>
Never
,
never
once
,
that
day
,
was
the
coach
in
any
position
,
attitude
,
or
kind
of
motion
to
which
we
are
accustomed
in
coaches
.
 
<EOS>
Never
did
it
make
the
smallest
approach
to
one
's
experience
of
the
proceedings
of
any
sort
of
vehicle
that
goes
on
wheels
.
   
<EOS>
Still
,
it
was
a
fine
day
,
and
the
temperature
was
delicious
,
and
though
we
had
left
Summer
behind
us
in
the
west
,
and
were
fast
leaving
Spring
,
we
were
moving
towards
Niagara
and
home
.
 
<EOS>
We
alighted
in
a
pleasant
wood
towards
the
middle
of
the
day
,
dined
on
a
fallen
tree
,
and
leaving
our
best
fragments
with
a
cottager
,
and
our
worst
with
the
pigs
(
who
swarm
in
this
part
of
the
country
like
grains
of
sand
on
the
sea
-
shore
,
to
the
great
comfort
of
our
commissariat
in
Canada
)
<EOS>
,
we
went
forward
again
,
gaily
.
   
<EOS>
As
night
came
on
,
the
track
grew
narrower
and
narrower
,
until
at
last
it
so
lost
itself
among
the
trees
,
that
the
driver
seemed
to
find
his
way
by
instinct
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
the
comfort
of
knowing
,
at
least
,
that
there
was
no
danger
of
his
falling
asleep
,
for
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
wheel
would
strike
against
an
unseen
stump
with
such
a
jerk
,
that
he
was
fain
to
hold
on
pretty
tight
and
pretty
quick
,
to
keep
himself
upon
the
box
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
there
any
reason
to
dread
the
least
danger
from
furious
driving
,
inasmuch
as
over
that
broken
ground
the
horses
had
enough
to
do
to
walk
;
<EOS>
as
to
shying
,
there
was
no
room
for
that
;
and
a
herd
of
wild
elephants
could
not
have
run
away
in
such
a
wood
,
with
such
a
coach
at
their
heels
.
 
<EOS>
So
we
stumbled
along
,
quite
satisfied
.
   
<EOS>
These
stumps
of
trees
are
a
curious
feature
in
American
travelling
.
<EOS>
The
varying
illusions
they
present
to
the
unaccustomed
eye
as
it
grows
dark
,
are
quite
astonishing
in
their
number
and
reality
.
<EOS>
Now
,
there
is
a
Grecian
urn
erected
in
the
centre
of
a
lonely
field
;
now
there
is
a
woman
weeping
at
a
tomb
;
now
a
very
commonplace
old
gentleman
in
a
white
waistcoat
,
with
a
thumb
thrust
into
each
arm
-
hole
of
his
coat
;
now
a
student
poring
on
a
book
;
now
a
crouching
negro
;
now
,
a
horse
,
a
dog
,
a
cannon
,
an
armed
man
;
a
hunch
-
back
throwing
off
his
cloak
and
stepping
forth
into
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
often
as
entertaining
to
me
as
so
many
glasses
in
a
magic
lantern
,
and
never
took
their
shapes
at
my
bidding
,
but
seemed
to
force
themselves
upon
me
,
whether
I
would
or
no
;
and
strange
to
say
,
I
sometimes
recognised
in
them
counterparts
of
figures
once
familiar
to
me
in
pictures
attached
to
childish
books
,
forgotten
long
ago
.
   
<EOS>
It
soon
became
too
dark
,
however
,
even
for
this
amusement
,
and
the
trees
were
so
close
together
that
their
dry
branches
rattled
against
the
coach
on
either
side
,
and
obliged
us
all
to
keep
our
heads
within
.
 
<EOS>
It
lightened
too
,
for
three
whole
hours
;
each
flash
being
very
bright
,
and
blue
,
and
long
;
and
as
the
vivid
streaks
came
darting
in
among
the
crowded
branches
,
and
the
thunder
rolled
gloomily
above
the
tree
tops
,
one
could
scarcely
help
thinking
that
there
were
better
neighbourhoods
at
such
a
time
than
thick
woods
afforded
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
,
between
ten
and
eleven
o'clock
at
night
,
a
few
feeble
lights
appeared
in
the
distance
,
and
Upper
Sandusky
,
an
Indian
village
,
where
we
were
to
stay
till
morning
,
lay
before
us
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
gone
to
bed
at
the
log
Inn
,
which
was
the
only
house
of
entertainment
in
the
place
,
but
soon
answered
to
our
knocking
,
and
got
some
tea
for
us
in
a
sort
of
kitchen
or
common
room
,
tapestried
with
old
newspapers
,
pasted
against
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
The
bed
-
chamber
to
which
my
wife
and
I
were
shown
,
was
a
large
,
low
,
ghostly
room
;
with
a
quantity
of
withered
branches
on
the
hearth
,
and
two
doors
without
any
fastening
,
opposite
to
each
other
,
both
opening
on
the
black
night
and
wild
country
,
and
so
contrived
,
that
one
of
them
always
blew
the
other
open
:
 
a
novelty
in
domestic
architecture
,
which
I
do
not
remember
to
have
seen
before
,
and
which
I
was
somewhat
disconcerted
to
have
forced
on
my
attention
after
getting
into
bed
,
as
I
had
a
considerable
sum
in
gold
for
our
travelling
expenses
,
in
my
dressing
-
case
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
luggage
,
however
,
piled
against
the
panels
,
soon
settled
this
difficulty
,
and
my
sleep
would
not
have
been
very
much
affected
that
night
,
I
believe
,
though
it
had
failed
to
do
so
.
   
<EOS>
My
Boston
friend
climbed
up
to
bed
,
somewhere
in
the
roof
,
where
another
guest
was
already
snoring
hugely
.
 
<EOS>
But
being
bitten
beyond
his
power
of
endurance
,
he
turned
out
again
,
and
fled
for
shelter
to
the
coach
,
which
was
airing
itself
in
front
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
not
a
very
politic
step
,
as
it
turned
out
;
for
the
pigs
scenting
him
,
and
looking
upon
the
coach
as
a
kind
of
pie
with
some
manner
of
meat
inside
,
grunted
round
it
so
hideously
,
that
he
was
afraid
to
come
out
again
,
and
lay
there
shivering
,
till
morning
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
possible
to
warm
him
,
when
he
did
come
out
,
by
means
of
a
glass
of
brandy
:
 
for
in
Indian
villages
,
the
legislature
,
with
a
very
good
and
wise
intention
,
forbids
the
sale
of
spirits
by
tavern
keepers
.
 
<EOS>
The
precaution
,
however
,
is
quite
inefficacious
,
for
the
Indians
never
fail
to
procure
liquor
of
a
worse
kind
,
at
a
dearer
price
,
from
travelling
pedlars
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
a
settlement
of
the
Wyandot
Indians
who
inhabit
this
place
.
<EOS>
Among
the
company
at
breakfast
was
a
mild
old
gentleman
,
who
had
been
for
many
years
employed
by
the
United
States
Government
in
conducting
negotiations
with
the
Indians
,
and
who
had
just
concluded
a
treaty
with
these
people
by
which
they
bound
themselves
,
in
consideration
of
a
certain
annual
sum
,
to
remove
next
year
to
some
land
provided
for
them
,
west
of
the
Mississippi
,
and
a
little
way
beyond
St
Louis
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
me
a
moving
account
of
their
strong
attachment
to
the
familiar
scenes
of
their
infancy
,
and
in
particular
to
the
burial
-
places
of
their
kindred
;
and
of
their
great
reluctance
to
leave
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
witnessed
many
such
removals
,
and
always
with
pain
,
though
he
knew
that
they
departed
for
their
own
good
.
 
<EOS>
The
question
whether
this
tribe
should
go
or
stay
,
had
been
discussed
among
them
a
day
or
two
before
,
in
a
hut
erected
for
the
purpose
,
the
logs
of
which
still
lay
upon
the
ground
before
the
inn
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
speaking
was
done
,
the
ayes
and
noes
were
ranged
on
opposite
sides
,
and
every
male
adult
voted
in
his
turn
.
 
<EOS>
The
moment
the
result
was
known
,
the
minority
(
a
large
one
)
cheerfully
yielded
to
the
rest
,
and
withdrew
all
kind
of
opposition
.
   
<EOS>
We
met
some
of
these
poor
Indians
afterwards
,
riding
on
shaggy
ponies
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
so
like
the
meaner
sort
of
gipsies
,
that
if
I
could
have
seen
any
of
them
in
England
,
I
should
have
concluded
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
that
they
belonged
to
that
wandering
and
restless
people
.
   
<EOS>
Leaving
this
town
directly
after
breakfast
,
we
pushed
forward
again
,
over
a
rather
worse
road
than
yesterday
,
if
possible
,
and
arrived
about
noon
at
Tiffin
,
where
we
parted
with
the
extra
.
 
<EOS>
At
two
o'clock
we
took
the
railroad
;
the
travelling
on
which
was
very
slow
,
its
construction
being
indifferent
,
and
the
ground
wet
and
marshy
;
and
arrived
at
Sandusky
in
time
to
dine
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
We
put
up
at
a
comfortable
little
hotel
on
the
brink
of
Lake
Erie
,
lay
there
that
night
,
and
had
no
choice
but
to
wait
there
next
day
,
until
a
steamboat
bound
for
Buffalo
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
The
town
,
which
was
sluggish
and
uninteresting
enough
,
was
something
like
the
back
of
an
English
watering
-
place
,
out
of
the
season
.
   
<EOS>
Our
host
,
who
was
very
attentive
and
anxious
to
make
us
comfortable
,
was
a
handsome
middle
-
aged
man
,
who
had
come
to
this
town
from
New
England
,
in
which
part
of
the
country
he
was
"
raised
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
When
I
say
that
he
constantly
walked
in
and
out
of
the
room
with
his
hat
on
;
and
stopped
to
converse
in
the
same
free
-
and
-
easy
state
;
and
lay
down
on
our
sofa
,
and
pulled
his
newspaper
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
read
it
at
his
ease
;
I
merely
mention
these
traits
as
characteristic
of
the
country
:
 
not
at
all
as
being
matter
of
complaint
,
or
as
having
been
disagreeable
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
undoubtedly
be
offended
by
such
proceedings
at
home
,
because
there
they
are
not
the
custom
,
and
where
they
are
not
,
they
would
be
impertinencies
;
but
in
America
,
the
only
desire
of
a
good
-
natured
fellow
of
this
kind
,
is
to
treat
his
guests
hospitably
and
well
;
and
I
had
no
more
right
,
and
<EOS>
I
can
truly
say
no
more
disposition
,
to
measure
his
conduct
by
our
English
rule
and
standard
,
than
I
had
to
quarrel
with
him
for
not
being
of
the
exact
stature
which
would
qualify
him
for
admission
into
the
Queen
's
grenadier
guards
.
 
<EOS>
As
little
inclination
had
I
to
find
fault
with
a
funny
old
lady
who
was
an
upper
domestic
in
this
establishment
,
and
who
,
when
she
came
to
wait
upon
us
at
any
meal
,
sat
herself
down
comfortably
in
the
most
convenient
chair
,
and
producing
a
large
pin
to
pick
her
teeth
with
,
remained
performing
that
ceremony
,
and
steadfastly
regarding
us
meanwhile
with
much
gravity
and
composure
(
now
and
then
pressing
us
to
eat
a
little
more
)
,
until
it
was
time
to
clear
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
enough
for
us
,
that
whatever
we
wished
done
was
done
with
great
civility
and
readiness
,
and
a
desire
to
oblige
,
not
only
here
,
but
everywhere
else
;
and
that
all
our
wants
were
,
in
general
,
zealously
anticipated
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
taking
an
early
dinner
at
this
house
,
on
the
day
after
our
arrival
,
which
was
Sunday
,
when
a
steamboat
came
in
sight
,
and
presently
touched
at
the
wharf
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
proved
to
be
on
her
way
to
Buffalo
,
we
hurried
on
board
with
all
speed
,
and
soon
left
Sandusky
far
behind
us
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
a
large
vessel
of
five
hundred
tons
,
and
handsomely
fitted
up
,
though
with
high
-
pressure
engines
;
<EOS>
which
always
conveyed
that
kind
of
feeling
to
me
,
which
I
should
be
likely
to
experience
,
I
think
,
if
I
had
lodgings
on
the
first
-
floor
of
a
powder
-
mill
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
laden
with
flour
,
some
casks
of
which
commodity
were
stored
upon
the
deck
.
 
<EOS>
The
captain
coming
up
to
have
a
little
conversation
,
and
to
introduce
a
friend
,
seated
himself
astride
of
one
of
these
barrels
,
like
a
Bacchus
of
private
life
;
and
pulling
a
great
clasp
-
knife
out
of
his
pocket
,
began
to
"
whittle
"
it
as
he
talked
,
by
paring
thin
slices
off
the
edges
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
whittled
with
such
industry
and
hearty
good
will
,
that
but
for
his
being
called
away
very
soon
,
it
must
have
disappeared
bodily
,
and
left
nothing
in
its
place
but
grist
and
shavings
.
   
<EOS>
After
calling
at
one
or
two
flat
places
,
with
low
dams
stretching
out
into
the
lake
,
whereon
were
stumpy
lighthouses
,
like
windmills
without
sails
,
the
whole
looking
like
a
Dutch
vignette
,
we
came
at
midnight
to
Cleveland
,
where
we
lay
all
night
,
and
until
nine
o'clock
next
morning
.
   
<EOS>
I
entertained
quite
a
curiosity
in
reference
to
this
place
,
from
having
seen
at
Sandusky
a
specimen
of
its
literature
in
the
shape
of
a
newspaper
,
which
was
very
strong
indeed
upon
the
subject
of
Lord
Ashburton
's
recent
arrival
at
Washington
,
to
adjust
the
points
in
dispute
between
the
United
States
Government
and
Great
Britain
:
informing
its
readers
that
as
America
had
"
whipped
"
England
in
her
infancy
,
and
whipped
her
again
in
her
youth
,
<EOS>
so
it
was
clearly
necessary
that
she
must
whip
her
once
again
in
her
maturity
;
and
pledging
its
credit
to
all
True
Americans
,
that
if
Mr
Webster
did
his
duty
in
the
approaching
negotiations
,
and
sent
the
English
Lord
home
again
in
double
quick
time
,
they
should
,
within
two
years
,
sing
"
Yankee
Doodle
in
Hyde
Park
,
and
Hail
Columbia
in
the
scarlet
courts
of
Westminster
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
found
it
a
pretty
town
,
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
beholding
the
outside
of
the
office
of
the
journal
from
which
I
have
just
quoted
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
enjoy
the
delight
of
seeing
the
wit
who
indited
the
paragraph
in
question
,
but
I
have
no
doubt
he
is
a
prodigious
man
in
his
way
,
and
held
in
high
repute
by
a
select
circle
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
gentleman
on
board
,
to
whom
,
<EOS>
as
I
unintentionally
learned
through
the
thin
partition
which
divided
our
state
-
room
from
the
cabin
in
which
he
and
his
wife
conversed
together
,
I
was
unwittingly
the
occasion
of
very
great
uneasiness
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
or
wherefore
,
but
I
appeared
to
run
in
his
mind
perpetually
,
and
to
dissatisfy
him
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
First
of
all
I
heard
him
say
:
and
the
most
ludicrous
part
of
the
business
was
,
that
he
said
it
in
my
very
ear
,
and
could
not
have
communicated
more
directly
with
me
,
if
he
had
leaned
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
whispered
me
:
 
<EOS>
"
Boz
is
on
board
still
,
my
dear
.
"
 
<EOS>
After
a
considerable
pause
,
he
added
,
complainingly
,
"
Boz
keeps
himself
very
close
;
"
which
was
true
enough
,
for
I
was
not
very
well
,
and
was
lying
down
,
with
a
book
.
<EOS>
I
thought
he
had
done
with
me
after
this
,
but
I
was
deceived
;
for
a
long
interval
having
elapsed
,
during
which
I
imagine
him
to
have
been
turning
restlessly
from
side
to
side
,
and
trying
to
go
to
sleep
;
he
broke
out
again
,
with
"
I
suppose
THAT
Boz
will
be
writing
a
book
by
-
and
-
by
,
and
putting
all
our
names
in
it
!
"
<EOS>
at
which
imaginary
consequence
of
being
on
board
a
boat
with
Boz
,
he
groaned
,
and
became
silent
.
   
<EOS>
We
called
at
the
town
of
Erie
,
at
eight
o'clock
that
night
,
and
lay
there
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Between
five
and
six
next
morning
,
we
arrived
at
Buffalo
,
where
we
breakfasted
;
and
being
too
near
the
Great
Falls
to
wait
patiently
anywhere
else
,
we
set
off
by
the
train
,
the
same
morning
at
nine
o'clock
,
to
Niagara
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
miserable
day
;
chilly
and
raw
;
a
damp
mist
falling
;
and
the
trees
in
that
northern
region
quite
bare
and
wintry
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
the
train
halted
,
I
listened
for
the
roar
;
and
was
constantly
straining
my
eyes
in
the
direction
where
I
knew
the
Falls
must
be
,
from
seeing
the
river
rolling
on
towards
them
;
every
moment
expecting
to
behold
the
spray
.
 
<EOS>
Within
a
few
minutes
of
our
stopping
,
not
before
,
I
saw
two
great
white
clouds
rising
up
slowly
and
majestically
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
all
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
we
alighted
:
 
and
then
for
the
first
time
,
I
heard
the
mighty
rush
of
water
,
and
felt
the
ground
tremble
underneath
my
feet
.
   
<EOS>
The
bank
is
very
steep
,
and
was
slippery
with
rain
,
and
half
-
melted
ice
.
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
how
I
got
down
,
but
I
was
soon
at
the
bottom
,
and
climbing
,
with
two
English
officers
who
were
crossing
and
had
joined
me
,
over
some
broken
rocks
,
deafened
by
the
noise
,
half
-
blinded
by
the
spray
,
and
wet
to
the
skin
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
at
the
foot
of
the
American
Fall
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
see
an
immense
torrent
of
water
tearing
headlong
down
from
some
great
height
,
but
had
no
idea
of
shape
,
or
situation
,
or
anything
but
vague
immensity
.
   
<EOS>
When
we
were
seated
in
the
little
ferry
-
boat
,
and
were
crossing
the
swollen
river
immediately
before
both
cataracts
,
I
began
to
feel
what
it
was
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
was
in
a
manner
stunned
,
and
unable
to
comprehend
the
vastness
of
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
I
came
on
Table
Rock
,
and
looked
---
<EOS>
Great
Heaven
,
on
what
a
fall
of
bright
-
green
water
!
---
that
it
came
upon
me
in
its
full
might
and
majesty
.
   
<EOS>
Then
,
when
I
felt
how
near
to
my
Creator
<EOS>
I
was
standing
,
the
first
effect
,
and
the
enduring
one
---
instant
and
lasting
---
of
the
tremendous
spectacle
,
was
Peace
.
 
<EOS>
Peace
of
Mind
,
tranquillity
,
calm
recollections
of
the
Dead
,
great
thoughts
of
Eternal
Rest
and
Happiness
:
 
nothing
of
gloom
or
terror
.
 
<EOS>
Niagara
was
at
once
stamped
upon
my
heart
,
an
Image
of
Beauty
;
to
remain
there
,
changeless
and
indelible
,
until
its
pulses
cease
to
beat
,
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
the
strife
and
trouble
of
daily
life
receded
from
my
view
,
and
lessened
in
the
distance
,
during
the
ten
memorable
days
we
passed
on
that
Enchanted
Ground
!
 
<EOS>
What
voices
spoke
from
out
the
thundering
water
;
what
faces
,
faded
from
the
earth
,
looked
out
upon
me
from
its
gleaming
depths
;
what
Heavenly
promise
glistened
in
those
angels
'
tears
,
the
drops
of
many
hues
,
that
showered
around
,
and
twined
themselves
about
the
gorgeous
arches
which
the
changing
rainbows
made
!
   
<EOS>
I
never
stirred
in
all
that
time
from
the
Canadian
side
,
whither
<EOS>
I
had
gone
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
crossed
the
river
again
;
for
I
knew
there
were
people
on
the
other
shore
,
and
in
such
a
place
it
is
natural
to
shun
strange
company
.
 
<EOS>
To
wander
to
and
fro
all
day
,
and
see
the
cataracts
from
all
points
of
view
;
to
stand
upon
the
edge
of
the
great
Horse
-
Shoe
Fall
,
marking
the
hurried
water
gathering
strength
as
it
approached
the
verge
,
yet
seeming
,
too
,
to
pause
before
it
shot
into
the
gulf
below
;
to
gaze
from
the
river
's
level
up
at
the
torrent
as
it
came
streaming
down
;
to
climb
the
neighbouring
heights
and
watch
it
through
the
trees
,
and
see
the
wreathing
water
in
the
rapids
hurrying
on
to
take
its
fearful
plunge
;
to
linger
in
the
shadow
of
the
solemn
rocks
three
miles
below
;
watching
the
river
as
,
stirred
by
no
visible
cause
,
it
heaved
and
eddied
and
awoke
the
echoes
,
being
troubled
yet
,
far
down
beneath
the
surface
,
by
its
giant
leap
;
to
have
Niagara
before
me
,
lighted
by
the
sun
and
by
the
moon
,
red
in
the
day
's
decline
,
and
grey
as
evening
slowly
fell
upon
it
;
to
look
upon
it
every
day
,
and
wake
up
in
the
night
and
hear
its
ceaseless
voice
:
 
<EOS>
this
was
enough
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
in
every
quiet
season
now
,
still
do
those
waters
roll
and
leap
,
and
roar
and
tumble
,
all
day
long
;
still
are
the
rainbows
spanning
them
,
a
hundred
feet
below
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
when
the
sun
is
on
them
,
do
they
shine
and
glow
like
molten
gold
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
when
the
day
is
gloomy
,
do
they
fall
like
snow
,
or
seem
to
crumble
away
like
the
front
of
a
great
chalk
cliff
,
or
roll
down
the
rock
like
dense
white
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
But
always
does
the
mighty
stream
appear
to
die
as
it
comes
down
,
and
always
from
its
unfathomable
grave
arises
that
tremendous
ghost
of
spray
and
mist
which
is
never
laid
:
 
which
has
haunted
this
place
with
the
same
dread
solemnity
since
Darkness
brooded
on
the
deep
,
and
that
first
flood
before
the
Deluge
---
Light
 
---
 
came
rushing
on
Creation
at
the
word
of
God
.

In

Again

I
wish
to
abstain
from
instituting
any

any

whatever
,
between
the

of

those
of
the
British
Possessions
in
Canada
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
reason
,
I
shall
confine
myself
to
a
very
brief
account
of
our
journeyings
in
the
latter
territory
.
   
<EOS>
But
before
I
leave
Niagara
,
I
must
advert
to
one
disgusting
circumstance
which
can
hardly
have
escaped
the
observation
of
any
decent
traveller
who
has
visited
the
Falls
.
   
<EOS>
On
Table
Rock
,
there
is
a
cottage
belonging
to
a
Guide
,
where
little
relics
of
the
place
are
sold
,
and
where
visitors
register
their
names
in
a
book
kept
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
wall
of
the
room
in
which
a
great
many
of
these
volumes
are
preserved
,
the
following
request
is
posted
:
 
"
Visitors
will
please
not
copy
nor
extract
the
remarks
and
poetical
effusions
from
the
registers
and
albums
kept
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
But
for
this
intimation
,
I
should
have
let
them
lie
upon
the
tables
on
which
they
were
strewn
with
careful
negligence
,
like
books
in
a
drawing
-
room
:
 
being
quite
satisfied
with
the
stupendous
silliness
of
certain
stanzas
with
an
anti
-
climax
at
the
end
of
each
,
which
were
framed
and
hung
up
on
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
Curious
,
however
,
after
reading
this
announcement
,
to
see
what
kind
of
morsels
were
so
carefully
preserved
,
I
turned
a
few
leaves
,
and
found
them
scrawled
all
over
with
the
vilest
and
the
filthiest
ribaldry
that
ever
human
hogs
delighted
in
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
humiliating
enough
to
know
that
there
are
among
men
brutes
so
obscene
and
worthless
,
that
they
can
delight
in
laying
their
miserable
profanations
upon
the
very
steps
of
Nature
's
greatest
altar
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
these
should
be
hoarded
up
for
the
delight
of
their
fellow
-
swine
,
and
kept
in
a
public
place
where
any
eyes
may
see
them
,
is
a
disgrace
to
the
English
language
in
which
they
are
written
(
though
I
hope
few
of
these
entries
have
been
made
by
Englishmen
)
,
and
a
reproach
to
the
English
side
,
on
which
they
are
preserved
.
   
<EOS>
The
quarters
of
our
soldiers
at
Niagara
,
are
finely
and
airily
situated
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
them
are
large
detached
houses
on
the
plain
above
the
Falls
,
which
were
originally
designed
for
hotels
;
and
in
the
evening
time
,
when
the
women
and
children
were
leaning
over
the
balconies
watching
the
men
as
they
played
at
ball
and
other
games
upon
the
grass
before
the
door
,
they
often
presented
a
little
picture
of
cheerfulness
and
animation
which
made
it
quite
a
pleasure
to
pass
that
way
.
   
<EOS>
At
any
garrisoned
point
where
the
line
of
demarcation
between
one
country
and
another
is
so
very
narrow
as
at
Niagara
,
desertion
from
the
ranks
can
scarcely
fail
to
be
of
frequent
occurrence
:
 
and
it
may
be
reasonably
supposed
that
when
the
soldiers
entertain
the
wildest
and
maddest
hopes
of
the
fortune
and
independence
that
await
them
on
the
other
side
,
the
impulse
to
play
traitor
,
which
such
a
place
suggests
to
dishonest
minds
,
is
not
weakened
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
very
rarely
happens
that
the
men
who
do
desert
,
are
happy
or
contented
afterwards
;
and
many
instances
have
been
known
in
which
they
have
confessed
their
grievous
disappointment
,
and
their
earnest
desire
to
return
to
their
old
service
if
they
could
but
be
assured
of
pardon
,
or
lenient
treatment
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
their
comrades
,
notwithstanding
<EOS>
,
do
the
like
,
from
time
to
time
;
and
instances
of
loss
of
life
in
the
effort
to
cross
the
river
with
this
object
,
are
far
from
being
uncommon
.
 
<EOS>
Several
men
were
drowned
in
the
attempt
to
swim
across
,
not
long
ago
;
and
one
,
who
had
the
madness
to
trust
himself
upon
a
table
as
a
raft
,
was
swept
down
to
the
whirlpool
,
where
his
mangled
body
eddied
round
and
round
some
days
.
   
<EOS>
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
noise
of
the
Falls
is
very
much
exaggerated
;
and
this
will
appear
the
more
probable
when
the
depth
of
the
great
basin
in
which
the
water
is
received
,
is
taken
into
account
.
 
<EOS>
At
no
time
during
our
stay
there
,
was
the
wind
at
all
high
or
boisterous
,
but
we
never
heard
them
,
three
miles
off
,
even
at
the
very
quiet
time
of
sunset
,
though
we
often
tried
.
   
<EOS>
Queenston
,
at
which
place
the
steamboats
start
for
Toronto
(
or
<EOS>
I
should
rather
say
at
which
place
they
call
,
for
their
wharf
is
at
Lewiston
,
on
the
opposite
shore
)
,
is
situated
in
a
delicious
valley
,
through
which
the
Niagara
river
,
in
colour
a
very
deep
green
,
pursues
its
course
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
approached
by
a
road
that
takes
its
winding
way
among
the
heights
by
which
the
town
is
sheltered
;
and
seen
from
this
point
is
extremely
beautiful
and
picturesque
.
<EOS>
On
the
most
conspicuous
of
these
heights
stood
a
monument
erected
by
the
Provincial
Legislature
in
memory
of
General
Brock
,
who
was
slain
in
a
battle
with
the
American
forces
,
after
having
won
the
victory
.
 
<EOS>
Some
vagabond
,
supposed
to
be
a
fellow
of
the
name
of
Lett
,
who
is
now
,
or
who
lately
was
,
in
prison
as
a
felon
,
blew
up
this
monument
two
years
ago
,
and
it
is
now
a
melancholy
ruin
,
with
a
long
fragment
of
iron
railing
hanging
dejectedly
from
its
top
,
and
waving
to
and
fro
like
a
wild
ivy
branch
or
broken
vine
stem
.
<EOS>
It
is
of
much
higher
importance
than
it
may
seem
,
that
this
statue
should
be
repaired
at
the
public
cost
,
as
it
ought
to
have
been
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Firstly
,
because
it
is
beneath
the
dignity
of
England
to
allow
a
memorial
raised
in
honour
of
one
of
her
defenders
,
to
remain
in
this
condition
,
on
the
very
spot
where
he
died
.
<EOS>
Secondly
,
because
the
sight
of
it
in
its
present
state
,
and
the
recollection
of
the
unpunished
outrage
which
brought
it
to
this
pass
,
is
not
very
likely
to
soothe
down
border
feelings
among
English
subjects
here
,
or
compose
their
border
quarrels
and
dislikes
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
standing
on
the
wharf
at
this
place
,
watching
the
passengers
embarking
in
a
steamboat
which
preceded
that
whose
coming
we
awaited
,
and
participating
in
the
anxiety
with
which
a
sergeant
's
wife
was
collecting
her
few
goods
together
---
keeping
one
distracted
eye
hard
upon
the
porters
,
who
were
hurrying
them
on
board
,
and
the
other
on
a
hoopless
washing
-
tub
for
which
,
as
being
the
most
utterly
worthless
of
all
her
movables
<EOS>
,
she
seemed
to
entertain
particular
affection
---
when
three
or
four
soldiers
with
a
recruit
came
up
and
went
on
board
.
   
<EOS>
The
recruit
was
a
likely
young
fellow
enough
,
strongly
built
and
well
made
,
but
by
no
means
sober
:
 
<EOS>
indeed
he
had
all
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
been
more
or
less
drunk
for
some
days
.
 
<EOS>
He
carried
a
small
bundle
over
his
shoulder
,
slung
at
the
end
of
a
walking
-
stick
,
and
had
a
short
pipe
in
his
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
as
dusty
and
dirty
as
recruits
usually
are
,
and
his
shoes
betokened
that
he
had
travelled
on
foot
some
distance
,
but
he
was
in
a
very
jocose
state
,
and
shook
hands
with
this
soldier
,
and
clapped
that
one
on
the
back
,
and
talked
and
laughed
continually
,
like
a
roaring
idle
dog
as
he
was
.
   
<EOS>
The
soldiers
rather
laughed
at
this
blade
than
with
him
:
 
seeming
to
say
,
as
they
stood
straightening
their
canes
in
their
hands
,
and
looking
coolly
at
him
over
their
glazed
stocks
,
"
Go
on
,
my
boy
,
while
you
may
!
<EOS>
you
'll
know
better
by
-
and
-
by
:
"
when
suddenly
the
novice
,
who
had
been
backing
towards
the
gangway
in
his
noisy
merriment
,
fell
overboard
before
their
eyes
,
and
splashed
heavily
down
into
the
river
between
the
vessel
and
the
dock
.
   
<EOS>
I
never
saw
such
a
good
thing
as
the
change
that
came
over
these
soldiers
in
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
Almost
before
the
man
was
down
,
their
professional
manner
,
their
stiffness
and
constraint
,
were
gone
,
and
they
were
filled
with
the
most
violent
energy
.
 
<EOS>
In
less
time
than
is
required
to
tell
it
,
they
had
him
out
again
,
feet
first
,
with
the
tails
of
his
coat
flapping
over
his
eyes
,
everything
about
him
hanging
the
wrong
way
,
and
the
water
streaming
off
at
every
thread
in
his
threadbare
dress
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
moment
they
set
him
upright
and
found
that
he
was
none
the
worse
,
they
were
soldiers
again
,
looking
over
their
glazed
stocks
more
composedly
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
The
half
-
sobered
recruit
glanced
round
for
a
moment
,
as
if
his
first
impulse
were
to
express
some
gratitude
for
his
preservation
,
but
seeing
them
with
this
air
of
total
unconcern
,
and
having
his
wet
pipe
presented
to
him
with
an
oath
by
the
soldier
who
had
been
by
far
the
most
anxious
of
the
party
,
he
stuck
it
in
his
mouth
,
thrust
his
hands
into
his
moist
pockets
,
and
without
even
shaking
the
water
off
his
clothes
,
walked
on
board
whistling
;
not
to
say
as
if
nothing
had
happened
,
but
as
if
he
had
meant
to
do
it
,
and
it
had
been
a
perfect
success
.
   
<EOS>
Our
steamboat
came
up
directly
this
had
left
the
wharf
,
and
soon
bore
us
to
the
mouth
of
the
Niagara
;
where
the
stars
and
stripes
of
America
flutter
on
one
side
and
the
Union
Jack
of
England
on
the
other
:
 
and
so
narrow
is
the
space
between
them
that
the
sentinels
in
either
fort
can
often
hear
the
watchword
of
the
other
country
given
.
 
<EOS>
Thence
we
emerged
on
Lake
Ontario
,
an
inland
sea
;
and
by
half
-
past
six
o'clock
were
at
Toronto
.
   
<EOS>
The
country
round
this
town
being
very
flat
,
is
bare
of
scenic
interest
;
but
the
town
itself
is
full
of
life
and
motion
,
bustle
,
business
,
and
improvement
.
 
<EOS>
The
streets
are
well
paved
,
and
lighted
with
gas
;
the
houses
are
large
and
good
;
the
shops
excellent
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
them
have
a
display
of
goods
in
their
windows
,
such
as
may
be
seen
in
thriving
county
towns
in
England
;
and
there
are
some
which
would
do
no
discredit
to
the
metropolis
itself
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
good
stone
prison
here
;
and
there
are
,
besides
,
a
handsome
church
,
a
court
-
house
,
public
offices
,
many
commodious
private
residences
,
and
a
government
observatory
for
noting
and
recording
the
magnetic
variations
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
College
of
Upper
Canada
,
which
is
one
of
the
public
establishments
of
the
city
,
a
sound
education
in
every
department
of
polite
learning
can
be
had
,
at
a
very
moderate
expense
:
 
the
annual
charge
for
the
instruction
of
each
pupil
,
not
exceeding
nine
pounds
sterling
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
pretty
good
endowments
in
the
way
of
land
,
and
is
a
valuable
and
useful
institution
.
   
<EOS>
The
first
stone
of
a
new
college
had
been
laid
but
a
few
days
before
,
by
the
Governor
General
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
handsome
,
spacious
edifice
,
approached
by
a
long
avenue
,
which
is
already
planted
and
made
available
as
a
public
walk
.
 
<EOS>
The
town
is
well
adapted
for
wholesome
exercise
at
all
seasons
,
for
the
footways
in
the
thoroughfares
which
lie
beyond
the
principal
street
,
are
planked
like
floors
,
and
kept
in
very
good
and
clean
repair
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
a
matter
of
deep
regret
that
political
differences
should
have
run
high
in
this
place
,
and
led
to
most
discreditable
and
disgraceful
results
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
long
since
guns
were
discharged
from
a
window
in
this
town
at
the
successful
candidates
in
an
election
,
and
the
coachman
of
one
of
them
was
actually
shot
in
the
body
,
though
not
dangerously
wounded
.
 
<EOS>
But
one
man
was
killed
on
the
same
occasion
;
and
from
the
very
window
whence
he
received
his
death
,
the
very
flag
which
shielded
his
murderer
(
not
only
in
the
commission
of
his
crime
,
but
from
its
consequences
)
,
was
displayed
again
on
the
occasion
of
the
public
ceremony
performed
by
the
Governor
General
,
to
which
I
have
just
adverted
.
 
<EOS>
Of
all
the
colours
in
the
rainbow
,
there
is
but
one
which
could
be
so
employed
:
 
I
need
not
say
that
flag
was
orange
.
   
<EOS>
The
time
of
leaving
Toronto
for
Kingston
is
noon
.
 
<EOS>
By
eight
o'clock
next
morning
,
the
traveller
is
at
the
end
of
his
journey
,
which
is
performed
by
steamboat
upon
Lake
Ontario
,
calling
at
Port
Hope
and
Coburg
,
the
latter
a
cheerful
,
thriving
little
town
.
 
<EOS>
Vast
quantities
of
flour
form
the
chief
item
in
the
freight
of
these
vessels
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
no
fewer
than
one
thousand
and
eighty
barrels
on
board
,
between
Coburg
and
Kingston
.
   
<EOS>
The
latter
place
,
which
is
now
the
seat
of
government
in
Canada
,
is
a
very
poor
town
,
rendered
still
poorer
in
the
appearance
of
its
market
-
place
by
the
ravages
of
a
recent
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
may
be
said
of
Kingston
,
that
one
half
of
it
appears
to
be
burnt
down
,
and
the
other
half
not
to
be
built
up
.
 
<EOS>
The
Government
House
is
neither
elegant
nor
commodious
,
yet
it
is
almost
the
only
house
of
any
importance
in
the
neighbourhood
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
an
admirable
jail
here
,
well
and
wisely
governed
,
and
excellently
regulated
,
in
every
respect
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
were
employed
as
shoemakers
,
ropemakers
,
blacksmiths
,
tailors
,
carpenters
,
and
stonecutters
;
and
in
building
a
new
prison
,
which
was
pretty
far
advanced
towards
completion
.
 
<EOS>
The
female
prisoners
were
occupied
in
needlework
.
 
<EOS>
Among
them
was
a
beautiful
girl
of
twenty
,
who
had
been
there
nearly
three
years
.
 
<EOS>
She
acted
as
bearer
of
secret
despatches
for
the
self
-
styled
Patriots
on
Navy
Island
,
during
the
Canadian
Insurrection
:
 
sometimes
dressing
as
a
girl
,
and
carrying
them
in
her
stays
;
sometimes
attiring
herself
as
a
boy
,
and
secreting
them
in
the
lining
of
her
hat
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
latter
character
she
always
rode
as
a
boy
would
,
which
was
nothing
to
her
,
for
she
could
govern
any
horse
that
any
man
could
ride
,
and
could
drive
four
-
in
-
hand
with
the
best
whip
in
those
parts
.
 
<EOS>
Setting
forth
on
one
of
her
patriotic
missions
,
she
appropriated
to
herself
the
first
horse
she
could
lay
her
hands
on
;
and
this
offence
had
brought
her
where
I
saw
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
quite
a
lovely
face
,
though
,
as
the
reader
may
suppose
from
this
sketch
of
her
history
,
there
was
a
lurking
devil
in
her
bright
eye
,
which
looked
out
pretty
sharply
from
between
her
prison
bars
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
a
bomb
-
proof
fort
here
of
great
strength
,
which
occupies
a
bold
position
,
and
is
capable
,
doubtless
,
of
doing
good
service
;
though
the
town
is
much
too
close
upon
the
frontier
to
be
long
held
,
I
should
imagine
,
for
its
present
purpose
in
troubled
times
.
<EOS>
There
is
also
a
small
navy
-
yard
,
where
a
couple
of
Government
steamboats
were
building
,
and
getting
on
vigorously
.
   
<EOS>
We
left
Kingston
for
Montreal
on
the
tenth
of
May
,
at
half
-
past
nine
in
the
morning
,
and
proceeded
in
a
steamboat
down
the
St
Lawrence
river
.
 
<EOS>
The
beauty
of
this
noble
stream
at
almost
any
point
,
but
especially
in
the
commencement
of
this
journey
when
it
winds
its
way
among
the
thousand
Islands
,
can
hardly
be
imagined
.
<EOS>
The
number
and
constant
successions
of
these
islands
,
all
green
and
richly
wooded
;
their
fluctuating
sizes
,
some
so
large
that
for
half
an
hour
together
one
among
them
will
appear
as
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
,
and
some
so
small
that
they
are
mere
dimples
on
its
broad
bosom
;
their
infinite
variety
of
shapes
;
and
the
numberless
combinations
of
beautiful
forms
which
the
trees
growing
on
them
present
:
 
all
form
a
picture
fraught
with
uncommon
interest
and
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
we
shot
down
some
rapids
where
the
river
boiled
and
bubbled
strangely
,
and
where
the
force
and
headlong
violence
of
the
current
were
tremendous
.
 
<EOS>
At
seven
o'clock
we
reached
Dickenson
's
Landing
,
whence
travellers
proceed
for
two
or
three
hours
by
stage
-
coach
:
 
the
navigation
of
the
river
being
rendered
so
dangerous
and
difficult
in
the
interval
,
by
rapids
,
that
steamboats
do
not
make
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
The
number
and
length
of
those
PORTAGES
,
over
which
the
roads
are
bad
,
and
the
travelling
slow
,
render
the
way
between
the
towns
of
Montreal
and
Kingston
,
somewhat
tedious
.
   
<EOS>
Our
course
lay
over
a
wide
,
uninclosed
tract
of
country
at
a
little
distance
from
the
river
-
side
,
whence
the
bright
warning
lights
on
the
dangerous
parts
of
the
St
Lawrence
shone
vividly
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
was
dark
and
raw
,
and
the
way
dreary
enough
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
nearly
ten
o'clock
when
we
reached
the
wharf
where
the
next
steamboat
lay
;
and
went
on
board
,
and
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
She
lay
there
all
night
,
and
started
as
soon
as
it
was
day
.
 
<EOS>
The
morning
was
ushered
in
by
a
violent
thunderstorm
,
and
was
very
wet
,
but
gradually
improved
and
brightened
up
.
 
<EOS>
Going
on
deck
after
breakfast
,
I
was
amazed
to
see
floating
down
with
the
stream
,
a
most
gigantic
raft
,
with
some
thirty
or
forty
wooden
houses
upon
it
,
and
at
least
as
many
flag
-
masts
,
so
that
it
looked
like
a
nautical
street
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
many
of
these
rafts
afterwards
,
but
never
one
so
large
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
timber
,
or
"
lumber
,
"
as
it
is
called
in
America
,
which
is
brought
down
the
St
Lawrence
,
is
floated
down
in
this
manner
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
raft
reaches
its
place
of
destination
,
it
is
broken
up
;
the
materials
are
sold
;
and
the
boatmen
return
for
more
.
   
<EOS>
At
eight
we
landed
again
,
and
travelled
by
a
stage
-
coach
for
four
hours
through
a
pleasant
and
well
-
cultivated
country
,
perfectly
French
in
every
respect
:
 
in
the
appearance
of
the
cottages
;
the
air
,
language
,
and
dress
of
the
peasantry
;
the
sign
-
boards
on
the
shops
and
taverns
:
 
and
the
Virgin
's
shrines
,
and
crosses
,
by
the
wayside
.
 
<EOS>
Nearly
every
common
labourer
and
boy
,
though
he
had
no
shoes
to
his
feet
,
wore
round
his
waist
a
sash
of
some
bright
colour
:
 
generally
red
:
 
and
the
women
,
who
were
working
in
the
fields
and
gardens
,
and
doing
all
kinds
of
husbandry
,
wore
,
one
and
all
,
great
flat
straw
hats
with
most
capacious
brims
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
Catholic
Priests
and
Sisters
of
Charity
in
the
village
streets
;
and
images
of
the
Saviour
at
the
corners
of
cross
-
roads
,
and
in
other
public
places
.
   
<EOS>
At
noon
we
went
on
board
another
steamboat
,
and
reached
the
village
of
Lachine
,
nine
miles
from
Montreal
,
by
three
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
we
left
the
river
,
and
went
on
by
land
.
   
<EOS>
Montreal
is
pleasantly
situated
on
the
margin
of
the
St
Lawrence
,
and
is
backed
by
some
bold
heights
,
about
which
there
are
charming
rides
and
drives
.
 
<EOS>
The
streets
are
generally
narrow
and
irregular
,
as
in
most
French
towns
of
any
age
;
but
in
the
more
modern
parts
of
the
city
,
they
are
wide
and
airy
.
 
<EOS>
They
display
a
great
variety
of
very
good
shops
;
and
both
in
the
town
and
suburbs
there
are
many
excellent
private
dwellings
.
 
<EOS>
The
granite
quays
are
remarkable
for
their
beauty
,
solidity
,
and
extent
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
a
very
large
Catholic
cathedral
here
,
recently
erected
with
two
tall
spires
,
of
which
one
is
yet
unfinished
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
open
space
in
front
of
this
edifice
,
stands
a
solitary
,
grim
-
looking
,
square
brick
tower
,
which
has
a
quaint
and
remarkable
appearance
,
and
which
the
wiseacres
of
the
place
have
consequently
determined
to
pull
down
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
The
Government
House
is
very
superior
to
that
at
Kingston
,
and
the
town
is
full
of
life
and
bustle
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
of
the
suburbs
is
a
plank
road
---
not
footpath
---
five
or
six
miles
long
,
and
a
famous
road
it
is
too
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
rides
in
the
vicinity
were
made
doubly
interesting
by
the
bursting
out
of
spring
,
which
is
here
so
rapid
,
that
it
is
but
a
day
's
leap
from
barren
winter
,
to
the
blooming
youth
of
summer
.
   
<EOS>
The
steamboats
to
Quebec
perform
the
journey
in
the
night
;
that
is
to
say
,
they
leave
Montreal
at
six
in
the
evening
,
and
arrive
at
Quebec
at
six
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
We
made
this
excursion
during
our
stay
in
Montreal
(
which
exceeded
a
fortnight
)
,
and
were
charmed
by
its
interest
and
beauty
.
   
<EOS>
The
impression
made
upon
the
visitor
by
this
Gibraltar
of
America
:
its
giddy
heights
;
its
citadel
suspended
,
as
it
were
,
in
the
air
;
its
picturesque
steep
streets
and
frowning
gateways
;
and
the
splendid
views
which
burst
upon
the
eye
at
every
turn
:
 
is
at
once
unique
and
lasting
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
a
place
not
to
be
forgotten
or
mixed
up
in
the
mind
with
other
places
,
or
altered
for
a
moment
in
the
crowd
of
scenes
a
traveller
can
recall
.
 
<EOS>
Apart
from
the
realities
of
this
most
picturesque
city
,
there
are
associations
clustering
about
it
which
would
make
a
desert
rich
in
interest
.
 
<EOS>
The
dangerous
precipice
along
whose
rocky
front
,
Wolfe
and
his
brave
companions
climbed
to
glory
;
the
Plains
of
Abraham
,
where
he
received
his
mortal
wound
;
the
fortress
so
chivalrously
defended
by
Montcalm
;
and
his
soldier
's
grave
,
dug
for
him
while
yet
alive
,
by
the
bursting
of
a
shell
;
are
not
the
least
among
them
,
or
among
the
gallant
incidents
of
history
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
a
noble
Monument
too
,
and
worthy
of
two
great
nations
,
which
perpetuates
the
memory
of
both
brave
generals
,
and
on
which
their
names
are
jointly
written
.
   
<EOS>
The
city
is
rich
in
public
institutions
and
in
Catholic
churches
and
charities
,
but
it
is
mainly
in
the
prospect
from
the
site
of
the
Old
Government
House
,
and
from
the
Citadel
,
that
its
surpassing
beauty
lies
.
 
<EOS>
The
exquisite
expanse
of
country
,
rich
in
field
and
forest
,
mountain
-
height
and
water
,
which
lies
stretched
out
before
the
view
,
with
miles
of
Canadian
villages
,
glancing
in
long
white
streaks
,
like
veins
along
the
landscape
;
the
motley
crowd
of
gables
,
roofs
,
and
chimney
tops
in
the
old
hilly
town
immediately
at
hand
;
the
beautiful
St
Lawrence
sparkling
and
flashing
in
the
sunlight
;
and
the
tiny
ships
below
the
rock
from
which
you
gaze
,
whose
distant
rigging
looks
like
spiders
'
webs
against
the
light
,
while
casks
and
barrels
on
their
decks
dwindle
into
toys
,
and
busy
mariners
become
so
many
puppets
;
all
this
,
framed
by
a
sunken
window
in
the
fortress
and
looked
at
from
the
shadowed
room
within
,
forms
one
of
the
brightest
and
most
enchanting
pictures
that
the
eye
can
rest
upon
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
spring
of
the
year
,
vast
numbers
of
emigrants
who
have
newly
arrived
from
England
or
from
Ireland
,
pass
between
Quebec
and
Montreal
on
their
way
to
the
backwoods
and
new
settlements
of
Canada
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
be
an
entertaining
lounge
(
as
I
very
often
found
it
)
to
take
a
morning
stroll
upon
the
quay
at
Montreal
,
and
see
them
grouped
in
hundreds
on
the
public
wharfs
about
their
chests
and
boxes
,
it
is
matter
of
deep
interest
to
be
their
fellow
-
passenger
on
one
of
these
steamboats
,
and
mingling
with
the
concourse
,
see
and
hear
them
unobserved
.
   
<EOS>
The
vessel
in
which
we
returned
from
Quebec
to
Montreal
was
crowded
with
them
,
and
at
night
they
spread
their
beds
between
decks
(
those
who
had
beds
,
at
least
)
,
and
slept
so
close
and
thick
about
our
cabin
door
,
that
the
passage
to
and
fro
was
quite
blocked
up
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
nearly
all
English
;
from
Gloucestershire
the
greater
part
;
and
had
had
a
long
winter
-
passage
out
;
but
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
clean
the
children
had
been
kept
,
and
how
untiring
in
their
love
and
self
-
denial
all
the
poor
parents
were
.
   
<EOS>
Ca
nt
as
we
may
,
and
as
we
shall
to
the
end
of
all
things
,
it
is
very
much
harder
for
the
poor
to
be
virtuous
than
it
is
for
the
rich
;
and
the
good
that
is
in
them
,
shines
the
brighter
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
many
a
noble
mansion
lives
a
man
,
the
best
of
husbands
and
of
fathers
,
whose
private
worth
in
both
capacities
is
justly
lauded
to
the
skies
.
 
<EOS>
But
bring
him
here
,
upon
this
crowded
deck
.
 
<EOS>
Strip
from
his
fair
young
wife
her
silken
dress
and
jewels
,
unbind
her
braided
hair
,
stamp
early
wrinkles
on
her
brow
,
pinch
her
pale
cheek
with
care
and
much
privation
,
array
her
faded
form
in
coarsely
patched
attire
,
let
there
be
nothing
but
his
love
to
set
her
forth
or
deck
her
out
,
and
you
shall
put
it
to
the
proof
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
So
change
his
station
in
the
world
,
that
he
shall
see
in
those
young
things
who
climb
about
his
knee
:
 
not
records
of
his
wealth
and
name
:
 
but
little
wrestlers
with
him
for
his
daily
bread
;
so
many
poachers
on
his
scanty
meal
;
so
many
units
to
divide
his
every
sum
of
comfort
,
and
farther
to
reduce
its
small
amount
.
 
<EOS>
In
lieu
of
the
endearments
of
childhood
in
its
sweetest
aspect
,
heap
upon
him
all
its
pains
and
wants
,
its
sicknesses
and
ills
,
its
fretfulness
,
caprice
,
and
querulous
endurance
:
 
let
its
prattle
be
,
not
of
engaging
infant
fancies
,
but
of
cold
,
and
thirst
,
and
hunger
:
 
and
if
his
fatherly
affection
outlive
all
this
,
and
he
be
patient
,
watchful
,
tender
;
careful
of
his
children
's
lives
,
and
mindful
always
of
their
joys
and
sorrows
;
then
send
him
back
to
Parliament
,
and
Pulpit
,
and
to
Quarter
Sessions
,
and
when
he
hears
fine
talk
of
the
depravity
of
those
who
live
from
hand
to
mouth
,
and
labour
hard
to
do
it
,
let
him
speak
up
,
as
one
who
knows
,
and
tell
those
holders
forth
that
they
,
by
parallel
with
such
a
class
,
should
be
High
Angels
in
their
daily
lives
,
and
lay
but
humble
siege
to
Heaven
at
last
.
   
<EOS>
Which
of
us
shall
say
what
he
would
be
,
if
such
realities
,
with
small
relief
or
change
all
through
his
days
,
were
his
!
 
<EOS>
Looking
round
upon
these
people
:
 
far
from
home
,
houseless
,
indigent
,
wandering
,
weary
with
travel
and
hard
living
:
 
and
seeing
how
patiently
they
nursed
and
tended
their
young
children
:
 
<EOS>
how
they
consulted
ever
their
wants
first
,
then
half
supplied
their
own
;
what
gentle
ministers
of
hope
and
faith
the
women
were
;
how
the
men
profited
by
their
example
;
and
how
very
,
very
seldom
even
a
moment
's
petulance
or
harsh
complaint
broke
out
among
them
:
 
<EOS>
I
felt
a
stronger
love
and
honour
of
my
kind
come
glowing
on
my
heart
,
and
wished
to
God
there
had
been
many
Atheists
in
the
better
part
of
human
nature
there
,
to
read
this
simple
lesson
in
the
book
of
Life
.
   
<EOS>
We
left
Montreal
for
New
York
again
,
on
the
thirtieth
of
May
,
crossing
to
La
Prairie
,
on
the
opposite
shore
of
the
St
Lawrence
,
in
a
steamboat
;
we
then
took
the
railroad
to
St
John
's
,
which
is
on
the
brink
of
Lake
Champlain
.
 
<EOS>
Our
last
greeting
in
Canada
was
from
the
English
officers
in
the
pleasant
barracks
at
that
place
(
a
class
of
gentlemen
who
had
made
every
hour
of
our
visit
memorable
by
their
hospitality
and
friendship
)
;
and
with
"
Rule
Britannia
"
sounding
in
our
ears
,
soon
left
it
far
behind
.
   
<EOS>
But
Canada
has
held
,
and
always
will
retain
,
a
foremost
place
in
my
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
Few
Englishmen
are
prepared
to
find
it
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
Advancing
quietly
;
old
differences
settling
down
,
and
being
fast
forgotten
;
public
feeling
and
private
enterprise
alike
in
a
sound
and
wholesome
state
;
nothing
of
flush
or
fever
in
its
system
,
but
health
and
vigour
throbbing
in
its
steady
pulse
:
 
<EOS>
it
is
full
of
hope
and
promise
.
 
<EOS>
To
me
---
who
had
been
accustomed
to
think
of
it
as
something
left
behind
in
the
strides
of
advancing
society
,
as
something
neglected
and
forgotten
,
slumbering
and
wasting
in
its
sleep
---
the
demand
for
labour
and
the
rates
of
wages
;
the
busy
quays
of
Montreal
;
the
vessels
taking
in
their
cargoes
,
and
discharging
them
;
the
amount
of
shipping
in
the
different
ports
;
the
commerce
,
roads
,
and
public
works
,
all
made
TO
LAST
;
the
respectability
and
character
of
the
public
journals
;
and
the
amount
of
rational
comfort
and
happiness
which
honest
industry
may
earn
:
were
very
great
surprises
.
 
<EOS>
The
steamboats
on
the
lakes
,
in
their
conveniences
,
cleanliness
,
and
safety
;
in
the
gentlemanly
character
and
bearing
of
their
captains
;
and
in
the
politeness
and
perfect
comfort
of
their
social
regulations
;
are
unsurpassed
even
by
the
famous
Scotch
vessels
,
deservedly
so
much
esteemed
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
The
inns
are
usually
bad
;
because
the
custom
of
boarding
at
hotels
is
not
so
general
here
as
in
the
States
,
and
the
British
officers
,
who
form
a
large
portion
of
the
society
of
every
town
,
live
chiefly
at
the
regimental
messes
:
 
but
in
every
other
respect
,
the
traveller
in
Canada
will
find
as
good
provision
for
his
comfort
as
in
any
place
I
know
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
one
American
boat
---
the
vessel
which
carried
us
on
Lake
Champlain
,
from
St
John
's
to
Whitehall
---
which
I
praise
very
highly
,
but
no
more
than
it
deserves
,
when
I
say
that
it
is
superior
even
to
that
in
which
we
went
from
Queenston
to
Toronto
,
or
to
that
in
which
we
travelled
from
the
latter
place
to
Kingston
,
or
I
have
no
doubt
I
may
add
to
any
other
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
This
steamboat
,
which
is
called
the
Burlington
,
is
a
perfectly
exquisite
achievement
of
neatness
,
elegance
,
and
order
.
 
<EOS>
The
decks
are
drawing
-
rooms
;
the
cabins
are
boudoirs
,
choicely
furnished
and
adorned
with
prints
,
pictures
,
and
musical
instruments
;
every
nook
and
corner
in
the
vessel
is
a
perfect
curiosity
of
graceful
comfort
and
beautiful
contrivance
.

Captain
Sherman
,
her
commander
,
to
whose
ingenuity
and
excellent
taste
<EOS>
these
results
are
solely
attributable
,
has
bravely
and
worthily
distinguished
himself
on
more
than
one
trying
occasion
:
 
not
least
among
them
,
in
having
the
moral
courage
to
carry
British
troops
,
at
a
time
(
during
the
Canadian
rebellion
)
when
no
other
conveyance
was
open
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
his
vessel
are
held
in
universal
respect
,
both
by
his
own
countrymen
and
ours
;
and
no
man
ever
enjoyed
the
popular
esteem
,
who
,
in
his
sphere
of
action
,
won
and
wore
it
better
than
this
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
By
means
of
this
floating
palace
we
were
soon
in
the
United
States
again
,
and
called
that
evening
at
Burlington
;
a
pretty
town
,
where
we
lay
an
hour
or
so
.
 
<EOS>
We
reached
Whitehall
,
where
we
were
to
disembark
,
at
six
next
morning
;
and
might
have
done
so
earlier
,
but
that
these
steamboats
lie
by
for
some
hours
in
the
night
,
in
consequence
of
the
lake
becoming
very
narrow
at
that
part
of
the
journey
,
and
difficult
of
navigation
in
the
dark
.
 
<EOS>
Its
width
is
so
contracted
at
one
point
,
indeed
,
that
they
are
obliged
to
warp
round
by
means
of
a
rope
.
   
<EOS>
After
breakfasting
at
Whitehall
,
we
took
the
stage
-
coach
for
Albany
:
 
a
large
and
busy
town
,
where
we
arrived
between
five
and
six
o'clock
that
afternoon
;
after
a
very
hot
day
's
journey
,
for
we
were
now
in
the
height
of
summer
again
.
 
<EOS>
At
seven
we
started
for
New
York
on
board
a
great
North
River
steamboat
,
which
was
so
crowded
with
passengers
that
the
upper
deck
was
like
the
box
lobby
of
a
theatre
between
the
pieces
,
and
the
lower
one
like
Tottenham
Court
Road
on
a
Saturday
night
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
slept
soundly
,
notwithstanding
,
and
soon
after
five
o'clock
next
morning
reached
New
York
.
   
<EOS>
Tarrying
here
,
only
that
day
and
night
,
to
recruit
after
our
late
fatigues
,
we
started
off
once
more
upon
our
last
journey
in
America
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
yet
five
days
to
spare
before
embarking
for
England
,
and
I
had
a
great
desire
to
see
"
the
Shaker
Village
,
"
which
is
peopled
by
a
religious
sect
from
whom
it
takes
its
name
.
   
<EOS>
To
this
end
,
we
went
up
the
North
River
again
,
as
far
as
the
town
of
Hudson
,
and
there
hired
an
extra
to
carry
us
to
Lebanon
,
thirty
miles
distant
:
 
and
of
course
another
and
a
different
Lebanon
from
that
village
where
I
slept
on
the
night
of
the
Prairie
trip
.
   
<EOS>
The
country
through
which
the
road
meandered
,
was
rich
and
beautiful
;
the
weather
very
fine
;
and
for
many
miles
the
Kaatskill
mountains
,
where
Rip
Van
Winkle
and
the
ghostly
Dutchmen
played
at
ninepins
one
memorable
gusty
afternoon
,
towered
in
the
blue
distance
,
like
stately
clouds
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
point
,
as
we
ascended
a
steep
hill
,
athwart
whose
base
a
railroad
,
yet
constructing
,
took
its
course
,
we
came
upon
an
Irish
colony
.
 
<EOS>
With
means
at
hand
of
building
decent
cabins
,
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
clumsy
,
rough
,
and
wretched
,
its
hovels
were
.
 
<EOS>
The
best
were
poor
protection
from
the
weather
the
worst
let
in
the
wind
and
rain
through
wide
breaches
in
the
roofs
of
sodden
grass
,
and
in
the
walls
of
mud
;
some
had
neither
door
nor
window
;
some
had
nearly
fallen
down
,
and
were
imperfectly
propped
up
by
stakes
and
poles
;
all
were
ruinous
and
filthy
.
 
<EOS>
Hideously
ugly
old
women
and
very
buxom
young
ones
,
pigs
,
dogs
,
men
,
children
,
babies
,
pots
,
kettles
,
dung
-
hills
,
vile
refuse
,
rank
straw
,
and
standing
water
,
all
wallowing
together
in
an
inseparable
heap
,
composed
the
furniture
of
every
dark
and
dirty
hut
.
   
<EOS>
Between
nine
and
ten
o'clock
at
night
,
we
arrived
at
Lebanon
which
is
renowned
for
its
warm
baths
,
and
for
a
great
hotel
,
well
adapted
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
to
the
gregarious
taste
of
those
seekers
after
health
or
pleasure
who
repair
here
,
but
inexpressibly
comfortless
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
shown
into
an
immense
apartment
,
lighted
by
two
dim
candles
,
called
the
drawing
-
room
:
 
<EOS>
from
which
there
was
a
descent
by
a
flight
of
steps
,
to
another
vast
desert
,
called
the
dining
-
room
:
 
<EOS>
our
bed
-
chambers
were
among
certain
long
rows
of
little
white
-
washed
cells
,
which
opened
from
either
side
of
a
dreary
passage
;
and
were
so
like
rooms
in
a
prison
that
I
half
expected
to
be
locked
up
when
I
went
to
bed
,
and
listened
involuntarily
for
the
turning
of
the
key
on
the
outside
.
 
<EOS>
There
need
be
baths
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
,
<EOS>
for
the
other
washing
arrangements
were
on
as
limited
a
scale
as
I
ever
saw
,
even
in
America
:
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
these
bedrooms
were
so
very
bare
of
even
such
common
luxuries
as
chairs
,
that
I
should
say
they
were
not
provided
with
enough
of
anything
,
but
that
I
bethink
myself
of
our
having
been
most
bountifully
bitten
all
night
.
   
<EOS>
The
house
is
very
pleasantly
situated
,
however
,
and
we
had
a
good
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
we
went
to
visit
our
place
of
destination
,
which
was
some
two
miles
off
,
and
the
way
to
which
was
soon
indicated
by
a
finger
-
post
,
whereon
was
painted
,
"
To
the
Shaker
Village
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
we
rode
along
,
we
passed
a
party
of
Shakers
,
who
were
at
work
upon
the
road
;
who
wore
the
broadest
of
all
broad
-
brimmed
hats
;
and
were
in
all
visible
respects
such
very
wooden
men
,
that
I
felt
about
as
much
sympathy
for
them
,
and
as
much
interest
in
them
,
as
if
they
had
been
so
many
figure
-
heads
of
ships
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
we
came
to
the
beginning
of
the
village
,
and
alighting
at
the
door
of
a
house
where
the
Shaker
manufactures
are
sold
,
and
which
is
the
headquarters
of
the
elders
,
requested
permission
to
see
the
Shaker
worship
.
   
<EOS>
Pending
the
conveyance
of
this
request
to
some
person
in
authority
,
we
walked
into
a
grim
room
,
where
several
grim
hats
were
hanging
on
grim
pegs
,
and
the
time
was
grimly
told
by
a
grim
clock
which
uttered
every
tick
with
a
kind
of
struggle
,
as
if
it
broke
the
grim
silence
reluctantly
,
and
under
protest
.
 
<EOS>
Ranged
against
the
wall
were
six
or
eight
stiff
,
high
-
backed
chairs
,
and
they
partook
so
strongly
of
the
general
grimness
that
one
would
much
rather
have
sat
on
the
floor
than
incurred
the
smallest
obligation
to
any
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
Presently
,
there
stalked
into
this
apartment
,
a
grim
old
Shaker
,
with
eyes
as
hard
,
and
dull
,
and
cold
,
as
the
great
round
metal
buttons
on
his
coat
and
waistcoat
;
a
sort
of
calm
goblin
.
 
<EOS>
Being
informed
of
our
desire
,
he
produced
a
newspaper
wherein
the
body
of
elders
,
whereof
he
was
a
member
,
<EOS>
had
advertised
but
a
few
days
before
,
that
in
consequence
of
certain
unseemly
interruptions
which
their
worship
had
received
from
strangers
,
their
chapel
was
closed
to
the
public
for
the
space
of
one
year
.
   
<EOS>
As
nothing
was
to
be
urged
in
opposition
to
this
reasonable
arrangement
,
we
requested
leave
to
make
some
trifling
purchases
of
Shaker
goods
;
which
was
grimly
conceded
.
 
<EOS>
We
accordingly
repaired
to
a
store
in
the
same
house
and
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
passage
,
where
the
stock
was
presided
over
by
something
alive
in
a
russet
case
,
which
the
elder
said
was
a
woman
;
and
which
I
suppose
WAS
a
woman
,
though
I
should
not
have
suspected
it
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
was
their
place
of
worship
:
 
a
cool
,
clean
edifice
of
wood
,
with
large
windows
and
green
blinds
:
like
a
spacious
summer
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
As
there
was
no
getting
into
this
place
,
and
nothing
was
to
be
done
but
walk
up
and
down
,
and
look
at
it
and
the
other
buildings
in
the
village
(
which
were
chiefly
of
wood
,
painted
a
dark
red
like
English
barns
,
and
composed
of
many
stories
like
English
factories
)
,
I
have
nothing
to
communicate
to
the
reader
,
beyond
the
scanty
results
I
gleaned
the
while
our
purchases
were
making
,
   
These
people
are
called
Shakers
from
their
peculiar
form
of
adoration
,
which
consists
of
a
dance
,
performed
by
the
men
and
women
of
all
ages
,
who
arrange
themselves
for
that
purpose
in
opposite
parties
:
 
the
men
first
divesting
themselves
of
their
hats
and
coats
,
which
they
gravely
hang
against
the
wall
before
they
begin
;
and
tying
a
ribbon
round
their
shirt
-
sleeves
,
as
though
they
were
going
to
be
bled
.
 
<EOS>
They
accompany
themselves
with
a
droning
,
humming
noise
,
and
dance
until
they
are
quite
exhausted
,
alternately
advancing
and
retiring
in
a
preposterous
sort
of
trot
.
<EOS>
The
effect
is
said
to
be
unspeakably
absurd
:
 
and
if
I
may
judge
from
a
print
of
this
ceremony
which
I
have
in
my
possession
;
and
which
I
am
informed
by
those
who
have
visited
the
chapel
,
is
perfectly
accurate
;
it
must
be
infinitely
grotesque
.
   
<EOS>
They
are
governed
by
a
woman
,
and
her
rule
is
understood
to
be
absolute
,
though
she
has
the
assistance
of
a
council
of
elders
.
<EOS>
She
lives
,
it
is
said
,
in
strict
seclusion
,
in
certain
rooms
above
the
chapel
,
and
is
never
shown
to
profane
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
at
all
resemble
the
lady
who
presided
over
the
store
,
it
is
a
great
charity
to
keep
her
as
close
as
possible
,
and
I
can
not
too
strongly
express
my
perfect
concurrence
in
this
benevolent
proceeding
.
   
<EOS>
All
the
possessions
and
revenues
of
the
settlement
are
thrown
into
a
common
stock
,
which
is
managed
by
the
elders
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
have
made
converts
among
people
who
were
well
to
do
in
the
world
,
and
are
frugal
and
thrifty
,
it
is
understood
that
this
fund
prospers
:
 
the
more
especially
as
they
have
made
large
purchases
of
land
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
is
this
at
Lebanon
the
only
Shaker
settlement
:
 
<EOS>
there
are
,
I
think
,
at
least
,
three
others
.
   
<EOS>
They
are
good
farmers
,
and
all
their
produce
is
eagerly
purchased
and
highly
esteemed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shaker
seeds
,
"
"
Shaker
herbs
,
"
and
"
Shaker
distilled
waters
,
"
are
commonly
announced
for
sale
in
the
shops
of
towns
and
cities
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
good
breeders
of
cattle
,
and
are
kind
and
merciful
to
the
brute
creation
.
 
<EOS>
Consequently
,
Shaker
beasts
seldom
fail
to
find
a
ready
market
.
   
<EOS>
They
eat
and
drink
together
,
after
the
Spartan
model
,
at
a
great
public
table
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
union
of
the
sexes
,
and
every
Shaker
,
male
and
female
,
is
devoted
to
a
life
of
celibacy
.
 
<EOS>
Rumour
has
been
busy
upon
this
theme
,
but
here
again
I
must
refer
to
the
lady
of
the
store
,
and
say
,
that
if
many
of
the
sister
Shakers
resemble
her
,
I
treat
all
such
slander
as
bearing
on
its
face
the
strongest
marks
of
wild
improbability
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
they
take
as
proselytes
,
persons
so
young
that
they
can
not
know
their
own
minds
,
and
can
not
possess
much
strength
of
resolution
in
this
or
any
other
respect
,
I
can
assert
from
my
own
observation
of
the
extreme
juvenility
of
certain
youthful
Shakers
whom
I
saw
at
work
among
the
party
on
the
road
.
   
<EOS>
They
are
said
to
be
good
drivers
of
bargains
,
but
to
be
honest
and
just
in
their
transactions
,
and
even
in
horse
-
dealing
to
resist
those
thievish
tendencies
which
would
seem
,
for
some
undiscovered
reason
,
to
be
almost
inseparable
from
that
branch
of
traffic
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
matters
they
hold
their
own
course
quietly
,
live
in
their
gloomy
,
silent
commonwealth
,
and
show
little
desire
to
interfere
with
other
people
.
   
<EOS>
This
is
well
enough
,
but
nevertheless
I
can
not
,
I
confess
,
incline
towards
the
Shakers
;
view
them
with
much
favour
,
or
extend
towards
them
any
very
lenient
construction
.
 
<EOS>
I
so
abhor
,
and
from
my
soul
detest
that
bad
spirit
,
<EOS>
no
matter
by
what
class
or
sect
it
may
be
entertained
,
which
would
strip
life
of
its
healthful
graces
,
rob
youth
of
its
innocent
pleasures
,
pluck
from
maturity
and
age
their
pleasant
ornaments
,
and
make
existence
but
a
narrow
path
towards
the
grave
:
 
that
odious
spirit
which
,
if
it
could
have
had
full
scope
and
sway
upon
the
earth
,
must
have
blasted
and
made
barren
the
imaginations
of
the
greatest
men
,
and
left
them
,
in
their
power
of
raising
up
enduring
images
before
their
fellow
-
creatures
yet
unborn
,
no
better
than
the
beasts
:
 
that
,
in
these
very
broad
-
brimmed
hats
and
very
sombre
coats
---
in
stiff
-
necked
,
solemn
-
visaged
piety
,
in
short
,
no
matter
what
its
garb
,
whether
it
have
cropped
hair
as
in
a
Shaker
village
,
or
long
nails
as
in
a
Hindoo
temple
---
I
recognise
the
worst
among
the
enemies
of
Heaven
and
Earth
,
who
turn
the
water
at
the
marriage
feasts
of
this
poor
world
,
not
into
wine
,
but
gall
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
there
must
be
people
vowed
to
crush
the
harmless
fancies
and
the
love
of
innocent
delights
and
gaieties
,
which
are
a
part
of
human
nature
:
 
as
much
a
part
of
it
as
any
other
love
or
hope
that
is
our
common
portion
:
 
<EOS>
let
them
,
for
me
,
stand
openly
revealed
among
the
ribald
and
licentious
;
the
very
idiots
know
that
THEY
are
not
on
the
Immortal
road
,
and
will
despise
them
,
and
avoid
them
readily
.
   
<EOS>
Leaving
the
Shaker
village
with
a
hearty
dislike
of
the
old
Shakers
,
and
a
hearty
pity
for
the
young
ones
:
 
tempered
by
the
strong
probability
of
their
running
away
as
they
grow
older
and
wiser
,
which
they
not
uncommonly
do
:
 
<EOS>
we
returned
to
Lebanon
,
and
so
to
Hudson
,
by
the
way
we
had
come
upon
the
previous
day
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
we
took
the
steamboat
down
the
North
River
towards
New
York
,
but
stopped
,
some
four
hours
'
journey
short
of
it
,
at
West
Point
,
where
we
remained
that
night
,
and
all
next
day
,
and
next
night
too
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
beautiful
place
:
 
the
fairest
among
the
fair
and
lovely
Highlands
of
the
North
River
:
 
shut
in
by
deep
green
heights
and
ruined
forts
,
and
looking
down
upon
the
distant
town
of
Newburgh
,
along
a
glittering
path
of
sunlit
water
,
with
here
and
there
a
skiff
,
whose
white
sail
often
bends
on
some
new
tack
as
sudden
flaws
of
wind
come
down
upon
her
from
the
gullies
in
the
hills
:
hemmed
in
,
besides
,
all
round
with
memories
of
Washington
,
and
events
of
the
revolutionary
war
:
 
is
the
Military
School
of
America
.
   
<EOS>
It
could
not
stand
on
more
appropriate
ground
,
and
any
ground
more
beautiful
can
hardly
be
.
 
<EOS>
The
course
of
education
is
severe
,
but
well
devised
,
and
manly
.
 
<EOS>
Through
June
,
July
,
and
August
,
the
young
men
encamp
upon
the
spacious
plain
whereon
the
college
stands
;
and
all
the
year
their
military
exercises
are
performed
there
,
daily
.
<EOS>
The
term
of
study
at
this
institution
,
which
the
State
requires
from
all
cadets
,
is
four
years
;
but
,
whether
it
be
from
the
rigid
nature
of
the
discipline
,
or
the
national
impatience
of
restraint
,
or
both
causes
combined
,
not
more
than
half
the
number
who
begin
their
studies
here
,
ever
remain
to
finish
them
.
   
<EOS>
The
number
of
cadets
being
about
equal
to
that
of
the
members
of
Congress
,
one
is
sent
here
from
every
Congressional
district
:
 
its
member
influencing
the
selection
.
 
<EOS>
Commissions
in
the
service
are
distributed
on
the
same
principle
.
 
<EOS>
The
dwellings
of
the
various
Professors
are
beautifully
situated
;
and
there
is
a
most
excellent
hotel
for
strangers
,
though
it
has
the
two
drawbacks
of
being
a
total
abstinence
house
(
wines
and
spirits
being
forbidden
to
the
students
)
,
and
of
serving
the
public
meals
at
rather
uncomfortable
hours
:
 
to
wit
,
breakfast
at
seven
,
dinner
at
one
,
and
supper
at
sunset
.
   
<EOS>
The
beauty
and
freshness
of
this
calm
retreat
,
in
the
very
dawn
and
greenness
of
summer
<EOS>
---
it
was
then
the
beginning
of
June
---
were
exquisite
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Leaving
it
upon
the
sixth
,
and
returning
to
New
York
,
to
embark
for
England
on
the
succeeding
day
,
I
was
glad
to
think
that
among
the
last
memorable
beauties
which
had
glided
past
us

The
Passage
Home
 
I
NEVER
had
so
much
interest
before
,
and
very
likely
I
shall
never
have
so
much
interest
again
,
in
the
state
of
the
wind
,
as
on
the
long
-
looked
-
for
morning
of
Tuesday
the
Seventh
of
June
.
 
<EOS>
Some
nautical
authority
had
told
me
a
day
or
two
previous
,
"
anything
with
west
in
it
,
will
do
;
"
so
when
I
darted
out
of
bed
at
daylight
,
and
throwing
up
the
window
,
was
saluted
by
a
lively
breeze
from
the
north
-
west
which
had
sprung
up
in
the
night
,
it
came
upon
me
so
freshly
,
rustling
with
so
many
happy
associations
,
that
I
conceived
upon
the
spot
a
special
regard
for
all
airs
blowing
from
that
quarter
of
the
compass
,
which
I
shall
cherish
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
until
my
own
wind
has
breathed
its
last
frail
puff
,
and
withdrawn
itself
for
ever
from
the
mortal
calendar
.
   
<EOS>
The
pilot
had
not
been
slow
to
take
advantage
of
this
favourable
weather
,
and
the
ship
which
yesterday
had
been
in
such
a
crowded
dock
that
she
might
have
retired
from
trade
for
good
and
all
,
for
any
chance
she
seemed
to
have
of
going
to
sea
,
was
now
full
sixteen
miles
away
.
 
<EOS>
A
gallant
sight
<EOS>
she
was
,
when
we
,
fast
gaining
on
her
in
a
steamboat
,
saw
her
in
the
distance
riding
at
anchor
:
 
<EOS>
her
tall
masts
pointing
up
in
graceful
lines
against
the
sky
,
and
every
rope
and
spar
expressed
in
delicate
and
thread
-
like
outline
:
 
gallant
,
too
,
when
,
we
being
all
aboard
,
the
anchor
came
up
to
the
sturdy
chorus
"
Cheerily
men
,
oh
cheerily
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
followed
proudly
in
the
towing
steamboat
's
wake
:
 
but
bravest
and
most
gallant
of
all
,
when
the
tow
-
rope
being
cast
adrift
,
the
canvas
fluttered
from
her
masts
,
and
spreading
her
white
wings
she
soared
away
upon
her
free
and
solitary
course
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
after
cabin
we
were
only
fifteen
passengers
in
all
,
and
the
greater
part
were
from
Canada
,
where
some
of
us
had
known
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
was
rough
and
squally
,
so
were
the
next
two
days
,
but
they
flew
by
quickly
,
and
we
were
soon
as
cheerful
and
snug
a
party
,
with
an
honest
,
manly
-
hearted
captain
at
our
head
,
as
ever
came
to
the
resolution
of
being
mutually
agreeable
,
on
land
or
water
.
   
<EOS>
We
breakfasted
at
eight
,
lunched
at
twelve
,
dined
at
three
,
and
took
our
tea
at
half
-
past
seven
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
abundance
of
amusements
,
and
dinner
was
not
the
least
among
them
:
 
firstly
,
for
its
own
sake
;
secondly
,
because
of
its
extraordinary
length
:
 
its
duration
,
inclusive
of
all
the
long
pauses
between
the
courses
,
being
seldom
less
than
two
hours
and
a
half
;
which
was
a
subject
of
never
-
failing
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
By
way
of
beguiling
the
tediousness
of
these
banquets
,
a
select
association
was
formed
at
the
lower
end
of
the
table
,
below
the
mast
,
to
whose
distinguished
president
modesty
forbids
me
to
make
any
further
allusion
,
which
,
being
a
very
hilarious
and
jovial
institution
,
was
(
prejudice
apart
)
in
high
favour
with
the
rest
of
the
community
,
and
particularly
with
a
black
steward
,
who
lived
for
three
weeks
in
a
broad
grin
at
the
marvellous
humour
of
these
incorporated
worthies
.
   
<EOS>
Then
,
we
had
chess
for
those
who
played
it
,
whist
,
cribbage
,
books
,
backgammon
,
and
shovelboard
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
weathers
,
fair
or
foul
,
calm
or
windy
,
we
were
every
one
on
deck
,
walking
up
and
down
in
pairs
,
lying
in
the
boats
,
leaning
over
the
side
,
or
chatting
in
a
lazy
group
together
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
no
lack
of
music
,
for
one
played
the
accordion
,
another
the
violin
,
and
another
<EOS>
(
who
usually
began
at
six
o'clock
AM
)
<EOS>
the
key
-
bugle
:
 
the
combined
effect
of
which
<EOS>
instruments
,
when
they
all
played
different
tunes
in
differents
parts
of
the
ship
,
at
the
same
time
,
and
within
hearing
of
each
other
,
as
they
sometimes
did
(
everybody
being
intensely
satisfied
with
his
own
performance
)
,
was
sublimely
hideous
.
   
<EOS>
When
all
these
means
of
entertainment
failed
,
a
sail
would
heave
in
sight
:
 
<EOS>
looming
,
perhaps
,
the
very
spirit
of
a
ship
,
in
the
misty
distance
,
or
passing
us
so
close
that
through
our
glasses
we
could
see
the
people
on
her
decks
,
and
easily
make
out
her
name
,
and
whither
she
was
bound
.
 
<EOS>
For
hours
together
we
could
watch
the
dolphins
and
porpoises
as
they
rolled
and
leaped
and
dived
around
the
vessel
;
or
those
small
creatures
ever
on
the
wing
,
the
Mother
Carey
's
chickens
,
which
had
borne
us
company
from
New
York
bay
,
and
for
a
whole
fortnight
fluttered
about
the
vessel
's
stern
.
 
<EOS>
For
some
days
we
had
a
dead
calm
,
or
very
light
winds
,
during
which
the
crew
amused
themselves
with
fishing
,
and
hooked
an
unlucky
dolphin
,
who
expired
,
in
all
his
rainbow
colours
,
on
the
deck
:
 
an
event
of
such
importance
in
our
barren
calendar
,
that
afterwards
we
dated
from
the
dolphin
,
and
made
the
day
on
which
he
died
,
an
era
.
   
<EOS>
Besides
all
this
,
when
we
were
five
or
six
days
out
,
there
began
to
be
much
talk
of
icebergs
,
of
which
wandering
islands
an
unusual
number
had
been
seen
by
the
vessels
that
had
come
into
New
York
a
day
or
two
before
we
left
that
port
,
and
of
whose
dangerous
neighbourhood
we
were
warned
by
the
sudden
coldness
of
the
weather
,
and
the
sinking
of
the
mercury
in
the
barometer
.
 
<EOS>
While
these
tokens
lasted
,
a
double
look
-
out
was
kept
,
and
many
dismal
tales
were
whispered
after
dark
,
of
ships
that
had
struck
upon
the
ice
and
gone
down
in
the
night
;
but
the
wind
obliging
us
to
hold
a
southward
course
,
we
saw
none
of
them
,
and
the
weather
soon
grew
bright
and
warm
again
.
   
<EOS>
The
observation
every
day
at
noon
,
and
the
subsequent
working
of
the
vessel
's
course
,
was
,
as
may
be
supposed
,
a
feature
in
our
lives
of
paramount
importance
;
nor
were
there
wanting
(
as
there
never
are
)
sagacious
doubters
of
the
captain
's
calculations
,
who
,
so
soon
as
his
back
was
turned
,
would
,
in
the
absence
of
compasses
,
measure
the
chart
with
bits
of
string
,
and
ends
of
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
,
and
points
of
snuffers
,
and
clearly
prove
him
to
be
wrong
by
an
odd
thousand
miles
or
so
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
edifying
to
see
these
unbelievers
shake
their
heads
and
frown
,
and
hear
them
hold
forth
strongly
upon
navigation
:
 
not
that
they
knew
anything
about
it
,
but
that
they
always
mistrusted
the
captain
in
calm
weather
,
or
when
the
wind
was
adverse
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
mercury
itself
is
not
so
variable
as
this
class
of
passengers
,
whom
you
will
see
,
when
the
ship
is
going
nobly
through
the
water
,
quite
pale
with
admiration
,
swearing
that
the
captain
beats
all
captains
ever
known
,
and
even
hinting
at
subscriptions
for
a
piece
of
plate
;
and
who
,
next
morning
,
when
the
breeze
has
lulled
,
and
all
the
sails
hang
useless
in
the
idle
air
,
shake
their
despondent
heads
again
,
and
say
,
with
screwed
-
up
lips
<EOS>
,
they
hope
that
captain
is
a
sailor
---
but
they
shrewdly
doubt
him
.
   
<EOS>
It
even
became
an
occupation
in
the
calm
,
to
wonder
when
the
wind
WOULD
spring
up
in
the
favourable
quarter
,
where
,
it
was
clearly
shown
by
all
the
rules
and
precedents
,
it
ought
to
have
sprung
up
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
mate
,
who
whistled
for
it
zealously
,
was
much
respected
for
his
perseverance
,
and
was
regarded
even
by
the
unbelievers
as
a
first
-
rate
sailor
.
 
<EOS>
Many
gloomy
looks
would
be
cast
upward
through
the
cabin
skylights
at
the
flapping
sails
while
dinner
was
in
progress
;
and
some
,
growing
bold
in
ruefulness
,
predicted
that
we
should
land
about
the
middle
of
July
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
always
on
board
ship
,
a
Sanguine
One
,
and
a
Despondent
One
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
character
carried
it
hollow
at
this
period
of
the
voyage
,
and
triumphed
over
the
Sanguine
One
at
every
meal
,
by
inquiring
where
he
supposed
the
Great
Western
(
which
left
New
York
a
week
after
us
)
<EOS>
was
NOW
:
 
and
where
he
supposed
the
"
Cunard
"
steam
-
packet
was
NOW
:
 
and
what
he
thought
of
sailing
vessels
,
as
compared
with
steamships
NOW
:
 
and
so
beset
his
life
with
pestilent
attacks
of
that
kind
,
that
he
too
was
obliged
to
affect
despondency
,
for
very
peace
and
quietude
.
   
<EOS>
These
were
additions
to
the
list
of
entertaining
incidents
,
but
there
was
still
another
source
of
interest
.
 
<EOS>
We
carried
in
the
steerage
nearly
a
hundred
passengers
:
 
a
little
world
of
poverty
:
<EOS>
and
as
we
came
to
know
individuals
among
them
by
sight
,
from
looking
down
upon
the
deck
where
they
took
the
air
in
the
daytime
,
and
cooked
their
food
,
and
very
often
ate
it
too
,
we
became
curious
to
know
their
histories
,
and
with
what
expectations
they
had
gone
out
to
America
,
and
on
what
errands
they
were
going
home
,
and
what
their
circumstances
were
.
 
<EOS>
The
information
we
got
on
these
heads
from
the
carpenter
,
who
had
charge
of
these
people
,
was
often
of
the
strangest
kind
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
them
had
been
in
America
but
three
days
,
some
but
three
months
,
and
some
had
gone
out
in
the
last
voyage
of
that
very
ship
in
which
they
were
now
returning
home
.
<EOS>
Others
had
sold
their
clothes
to
raise
the
passage
-
money
,
and
had
hardly
rags
to
cover
them
;
others
had
no
food
,
and
lived
upon
the
charity
of
the
rest
:
 
and
one
man
,
it
was
discovered
nearly
at
the
end
of
the
voyage
,
not
before
---
for
he
kept
his
secret
close
,
and
did
not
court
compassion
---
had
had
no
sustenance
<EOS>
whatever
but
the
bones
and
scraps
of
fat
he
took
from
the
plates
used
in
the
after
-
cabin
dinner
,
when
they
were
put
out
to
be
washed
.
   
<EOS>
The
whole
system
of
shipping
and
conveying
these
unfortunate
persons
,
is
one
that
stands
in
need
of
thorough
revision
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
class
deserve
to
be
protected
and
assisted
by
the
Government
,
it
is
that
class
who
are
banished
from
their
native
land
in
search
of
the
bare
means
of
subsistence
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
could
be
done
for
these
poor
people
by
the
great
compassion
and
humanity
of
the
captain
and
officers
was
done
,
but
they
require
much
more
.
 
<EOS>
The
law
is
bound
,
at
least
upon
the
English
side
,
to
see
that
too
many
of
them
are
not
put
on
board
one
ship
:
 
and
that
their
accommodations
are
decent
:
 
not
demoralising
,
and
profligate
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
bound
,
too
,
in
common
humanity
,
to
declare
that
no
man
shall
be
taken
on
board
without
his
stock
of
provisions
being
previously
inspected
by
some
proper
officer
,
and
pronounced
moderately
sufficient
for
his
support
upon
the
voyage
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
bound
to
provide
,
or
to
require
that
there
be
provided
,
a
medical
attendant
;
whereas
in
these
ships
there
are
none
,
though
sickness
of
adults
,
and
deaths
of
children
,
on
the
passage
,
are
matters
of
the
very
commonest
occurrence
.
<EOS>
Above
all
it
is
the
duty
of
any
Government
,
be
it
monarchy
or
republic
,
to
interpose
and
put
an
end
to
that
system
by
which
a
firm
of
traders
in
emigrants
purchase
of
the
owners
the
whole
'
tween
-
decks
of
a
ship
,
and
send
on
board
as
many
wretched
people
as
they
can
lay
hold
of
,
on
any
terms
they
can
get
,
without
the
smallest
reference
to
the
conveniences
of
the
steerage
,
the
number
of
berths
,
the
slightest
separation
of
the
sexes
,
or
anything
but
their
own
immediate
profit
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
is
even
this
the
worst
of
the
vicious
system
:
 
for
,
certain
crimping
agents
of
these
houses
,
who
have
a
percentage
on
all
the
passengers
they
inveigle
,
are
constantly
travelling
about
those
districts
where
poverty
and
discontent
are
rife
,
and
tempting
the
credulous
into
more
misery
,
by
holding
out
monstrous
inducements
to
emigration
which
can
never
be
realised
.
   
<EOS>
The
history
of
every
family
we
had
on
board
was
pretty
much
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
After
hoarding
up
,
and
borrowing
,
and
begging
,
and
selling
everything
to
pay
the
passage
,
they
had
gone
out
to
New
York
,
expecting
to
find
its
streets
paved
with
gold
;
and
had
found
them
paved
with
very
hard
and
very
real
stones
.
 
<EOS>
Enterprise
was
dull
;
labourers
were
not
wanted
;
jobs
of
work
were
to
be
got
,
but
the
payment
was
not
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
coming
back
,
even
poorer
than
they
went
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
them
was
carrying
an
open
letter
from
a
young
English
artisan
,
who
had
been
in
New
York
a
fortnight
,
to
a
friend
near
Manchester
,
whom
he
strongly
urged
to
follow
him
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
officers
brought
it
to
me
as
a
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
country
,
Jem
,
"
said
the
writer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
like
America
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
despotism
here
;
that
's
the
great
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Employment
of
all
sorts
is
going
a
-
begging
,
and
wages
are
capital
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
only
to
choose
a
trade
,
Jem
,
and
be
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
n't
made
choice
of
one
yet
,
but
I
shall
soon
.
 
<EOS>
AT
<EOS>
PRESENT
<EOS>
I
HAVEN'T

QUITE

A
TAILOR

"
   
<EOS>
There
was
yet
another
kind
of
passenger
,
and
<EOS>
but
one
more
,
who
,
in
the
calm
and
the
light
winds
,
was
a
constant
theme
of
conversation
and
observation
among
us
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
an
English
sailor
,
a
smart
,
thorough
-
built
,
English
man
-
of
-
war's
-
man
from
his
hat
to
his
shoes
,
who
was
serving
in
the
American
navy
,
and
having
got
leave
of
absence
was
on
his
way
home
to
see
his
friends
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
presented
himself
to
take
and
pay
for
his
passage
,
it
had
been
suggested
to
him
that
being
an
able
seaman
he
might
as
well
work
it
and
save
the
money
,
but
this
piece
of
advice
he
very
indignantly
rejected
:
saying
,
"
He
'd
be
damned
but
for
once
he
'd
go
aboard
ship
,
as
a
gentleman
.
"
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
they
took
his
money
,
but
he
no
sooner
came
aboard
,
than
he
stowed
his
kit
in
the
forecastle
,
arranged
to
mess
with
the
crew
,
and
the
very
first
time
the
hands
were
turned
up
,
went
aloft
like
a
cat
,
before
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
And
all
through
the
passage
there
he
was
,
first
at
the
braces
,
outermost
on
the
yards
,
perpetually
lending
a
hand
everywhere
,
but
always
with
a
sober
dignity
in
his
manner
,
and
a
sober
grin
on
his
face
,
which
plainly
said
,
"
I
do
it
as
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
For
my
own
pleasure
,
mind
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
At
length
and
at
last
,
the
promised
wind
came
up
in
right
good
earnest
,
and
away
we
went
before
it
,
with
every
stitch
of
canvas
set
,
slashing
through
the
water
nobly
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
grandeur
in
the
motion
of
the
splendid
ship
,
as
overshadowed
by
her
mass
of
sails
,
she
rode
at
a
furious
pace
upon
the
waves
,
which
filled
one
with
an
indescribable
sense
of
pride
and
exultation
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
plunged
into
a
foaming
valley
,
how
I
loved
to
see
the
green
waves
,
bordered
deep
with
white
,
come
rushing
on
astern
,
to
buoy
her
upward
at
their
pleasure
,
and
curl
about
her
as
she
stooped
again
,
but
always
own
her
for
their
haughty
mistress
still
!
 
<EOS>
On
,
on
we
flew
,
with
changing
lights
upon
the
water
,
being
now
in
the
blessed
region
of
fleecy
skies
;
a
bright
sun
lighting
us
by
day
,
and
a
bright
moon
by
night
;
the
vane
pointing
directly
homeward
,
alike
the
truthful
index
to
the
favouring
wind
and
to
our
cheerful
hearts
;
until
at
sunrise
,
one
fair
Monday
morning
---
the
twenty
-
seventh
of
June
,
I
shall
not
easily
forget
the
day
---
there
lay
before
us
,
old
Cape
Clear
,
God
bless
it
,
showing
,
in
the
mist
of
early
morning
,
like
a
cloud
:
 
the
brightest
and
most
welcome
cloud
,
to
us
,
that
ever
hid
the
face
of
Heaven
's
fallen
sister
---
Home
.
   
<EOS>
Dim
speck
as
it
was
in
the
wide
prospect
<EOS>
,
it
made
the
sunrise
a
more
cheerful
sight
,
and
gave
to
it
that
sort
of
human
interest
which
it
seems
to
want
at
sea
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
as
elsewhere
,
the
return
of
day
is
inseparable
from
some
sense
of
renewed
hope
and
gladness
;
but
the
light
shining
on
the
dreary
waste
of
water
,
and
showing
it
in
all
its
vast
extent
of
loneliness
,
presents
a
solemn
spectacle
,
which
even
night
,
veiling
it
in
darkness
and
uncertainty
,
does
not
surpass
.
 
<EOS>
The
rising
of
the
moon
is
more
in
keeping
with
the
solitary
ocean
;
and
has
an
air
of
melancholy
grandeur
,
which
in
its
soft
and
gentle
influence
,
seems
to
comfort
while
it
saddens
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
when
I
was
a
very
young
child
having
a
fancy
that
the
reflection
of
the
moon
in
water
was
a
path
to
Heaven
,
trodden
by
the
spirits
of
good
people
on
their
way
to
God
;
and
this
old
feeling
often
came
over
me
again
,
when
I
watched
it
on
a
tranquil
night
at
sea
.
   
<EOS>
The
wind
was
very
light
on
this
same
Monday
morning
,
but
it
was
still
in
the
right
quarter
,
and
so
,
by
slow
degrees
,
we
left
Cape
Clear
behind
,
and
sailed
along
within
sight
of
the
coast
of
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
And
how
merry
we
all
were
,
and
how
loyal
to
the
George
Washington
,
and
how
full
of
mutual
congratulations
,
and
how
venturesome
in
predicting
the
exact
hour
at
which
we
should
arrive
at
Liverpool
,
may
be
easily
imagined
and
readily
understood
.
 
<EOS>
Also
,
how
heartily
we
drank
the
captain
's
health
that
day
at
dinner
;
and
how
restless
we
became
about
packing
up
:
 
and
how
two
or
three
of
the
most
sanguine
spirits
rejected
the
idea
of
going
to
bed
at
all
that
night
as
something
it
was
not
worth
while
to
do
,
so
near
the
shore
,
but
went
nevertheless
,
and
slept
soundly
;
and
how
to
be
so
near
our
journey
's
end
,
was
like
a
pleasant
dream
,
from
which
one
feared
to
wake
.
   
<EOS>
The
friendly
breeze
freshened
again
next
day
,
and
on
we
went
once
more
before
it
gallantly
:
 
descrying
now
and
then
an
English
ship
going
homeward
under
shortened
sail
,
while
we
,
with
every
inch
of
canvas
crowded
on
,
dashed
gaily
past
,
and
left
her
far
behind
.
<EOS>
Towards
evening
,
the
weather
turned
hazy
,
with
a
drizzling
rain
;
and
soon
became
so
thick
,
that
we
sailed
,
as
it
were
,
in
a
cloud
.
<EOS>
Still
we
swept
onward
like
a
phantom
ship
,
and
many
an
eager
eye
glanced
up
to
where
the
Look
-
out
on
the
mast
kept
watch
for
Holyhead
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
his
long
-
expected
cry
was
heard
,
and
at
the
same
moment
there
shone
out
from
the
haze
and
mist
ahead
,
a
gleaming
light
,
which
presently
was
gone
,
and
soon
returned
,
and
soon
was
gone
again
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
it
came
back
,
the
eyes
of
all
on
board
,
brightened
and
sparkled
like
itself
:
 
<EOS>
and
there
we
all
stood
,
watching
this
revolving
light
upon
the
rock
at
Holyhead
,
and
praising
it
for
its
brightness
and
its
friendly
warning
,
and
lauding
it
,
in
short
,
above
all
other
signal
lights
that
ever
were
displayed
,
until
it
once
more
glimmered
faintly
in
the
distance
,
far
behind
us
.
   
<EOS>
Then
,
it
was
time
to
fire
a
gun
,
for
a
pilot
;
and
almost
before
its
smoke
had
cleared
away
,
a
little
boat
with
a
light
at
her
masthead
came
bearing
down
upon
us
,
through
the
darkness
,
swiftly
.
 
<EOS>
And
presently
,
our
sails
being
backed
,
she
ran
alongside
;
and
the
hoarse
pilot
,
wrapped
and
muffled
in
pea
-
coats
and
shawls
to
the
very
bridge
of
his
weather
-
ploughed
-
up
nose
,
stood
bodily
among
us
on
the
deck
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
think
if
that
pilot
had
wanted
to
borrow
fifty
pounds
for
an
indefinite
period
on
no
security
,
we
should
have
engaged
to
lend
it
to
him
,
among
us
,
before
his
boat
had
dropped
astern
,
or
(
which
is
the
same
thing
)
before
every
scrap
of
news
in
the
paper
he
brought
with
him
had
become
the
common
property
of
all
on
board
.
   
<EOS>
We
turned
in
pretty
late
that
night
,
and
turned
out
pretty
early
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
By
six
o'clock
we
clustered
on
the
deck
,
prepared
to
go
ashore
;
and
looked
upon
the
spires
,
and
roofs
,
and
smoke
,
of
Liverpool
.
 
<EOS>
By
eight
we
all
sat
down
in
one
of
its
Hotels
,
to
eat
and
drink
together
for
the
last
time
.
 
<EOS>
And
by
nine
we
had
shaken
hands
all
round
,
and
broken
up
our
social
company
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
The
country
,
by
the
railroad
,
seemed
,
as
we
rattled
through
it
,
like
a
luxuriant
garden
.
 
<EOS>
The
beauty
of
the
fields
(
so
small
they
looked
!
)
,
the
hedge
-
rows
,
and
the
trees
;
the
pretty
cottages
,
the
beds
of
flowers
,
the
old
churchyards
,
the
antique
houses
,
and
every
well
-
known
object
;
the
exquisite
delights
of
that
one
journey
,
crowding
in
the
short
compass
of
a
summer
's
day
,
the
joy
of
many
years
,
with
the
winding
up
with
Home
and
all
that
makes
it
dear
<EOS>
;
no
tongue
can
tell
,
or
pen
of
mine
describe
.

Chapter
17

<EOS>
Slavery
 
<EOS>
THE
upholders
of
slavery
in
America
---
of
the
atrocities
of
which
system
,
I
shall
not
write
one
word
for
which
I
have
not
had
ample
proof
and
warrant
---
may
be
divided
into
three
great
classes
.
   
<EOS>
The
first
,
are
those
more
moderate
and
rational
owners
of
human
cattle
,
who
have
come
into
the
possession
of
them
as
so
many
coins
in
their
trading
capital
,
but
who
admit
the
frightful
nature
of
the
Institution
in
the
abstract
,
and
perceive
the
dangers
to
society
with
which
it
is
fraught
:
 
dangers
which
however
distant
they
may
be
,
or
howsoever
tardy
in
their
coming
on
,
are
as
certain
to
fall
upon
its
guilty
head
,
as
is
the
Day
of
Judgment
.
   
<EOS>
The
second
,
consists
of
all
those
owners
,
breeders
,
users
,
buyers
and
sellers
of
slaves
,
who
will
,
until
the
bloody
chapter
has
a
bloody
end
,
own
,
breed
,
use
,
buy
,
and
sell
them
at
all
hazards
:
who
doggedly
deny
the
horrors
of
the
system
in
the
teeth
of
such
a
mass
of
evidence
as
never
was
brought
to
bear
on
any
other
subject
,
and
to
which
the
experience
of
every
day
contributes
its
immense
amount
;
who
would
at
this
or
any
other
moment
,
gladly
involve
America
in
a
war
,
civil
or
foreign
,
provided
that
it
had
for
its
sole
end
and
object
the
assertion
of
their
right
to
perpetuate
slavery
,
and
to
whip
and
work
and
torture
slaves
,
unquestioned
by
any
human
authority
,
and
unassailed
by
any
human
power
;
who
,
when
they
speak
of
Freedom
,
mean
the
Freedom
to
oppress
their
kind
,
and
to
be
savage
,
merciless
,
and
cruel
;
and
of
whom
every
man
on
his
own
ground
,
in
republican
America
,
is
a
more
exacting
,
and
a
sterner
,
and
a
less
responsible
despot
than
the
Caliph
Haroun
Alraschid
in
his
angry
robe
of
scarlet
.
   
<EOS>
The
third
,
and
not
the
least
numerous
or
influential
,
is
composed
of
all
that
delicate
gentility
which
can
not
bear
a
superior
,
and
can
not
brook
an
equal
;
of
that
class
whose
Republicanism
means
,
"
I
will
not
tolerate
a
man
above
me
:
 
and
of
those
below
,
none
must
approach
too
near
;
"
whose
pride
,
in
a
land
where
voluntary
servitude
is
shunned
as
a
disgrace
,
must
be
ministered
to
by
slaves
;
and
whose
inalienable
rights
can
only
have
their
growth
in
negro
wrongs
.
   
<EOS>
It
has
been
sometimes
urged
that
,
in
the
unavailing
efforts
which
have
been
made
to
advance
the
cause
of
Human
Freedom
in
the
republic
of
America
(
strange
cause
for
history
to
treat
of
!
)
,
sufficient
regard
has
not
been
had
to
the
existence
of
the
first
class
of
persons
;
and
it
has
been
contended
that
they
are
hardly
used
,
in
being
confounded
with
the
second
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
,
no
doubt
,
the
case
;
noble
instances
of
pecuniary
and
personal
sacrifice
have
already
had
their
growth
among
them
;
and
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
the
gulf
between
them
and
the
advocates
of
emancipation
should
have
been
widened
and
deepened
by
any
means
:
 
<EOS>
the
rather
,
as
there
are
,
beyond
dispute
,
among
these
slave
-
owners
,
many
kind
masters
who
are
tender
in
the
exercise
of
their
unnatural
power
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
it
is
to
be
feared
that
this
injustice
is
inseparable
from
the
state
of
things
with
which
humanity
and
truth
are
called
upon
to
deal
.
<EOS>
Slavery
is
not
a
whit
the
more
endurable
because
some
hearts
are
to
be
found
which
can
partially
resist
its
hardening
influences
;
nor
can
the
indignant
tide
of
honest
wrath
stand
still
,
because
in
its
onward
course
it
overwhelms
a
few
who
are
comparatively
innocent
,
among
a
host
of
guilty
.
   
<EOS>
The
ground
most
commonly
taken
by
these
better
men
among
the
advocates
of
slavery
,
is
this
:
 
"
It
is
a
bad
system
;
and
for
myself
I
would
willingly
get
rid
of
it
,
if
I
could
;
most
willingly
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
so
bad
,
as
you
in
England
take
it
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
deceived
by
the
representations
of
the
emancipationists
.
 
<EOS>
The
greater
part
of
my
slaves
are
much
attached
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
say
that
I
do
not
allow
them
to
be
severely
treated
;
but
I
will
put
it
to
you
whether
you
believe
that
it
can
be
a
general
practice
to
treat
them
inhumanly
,
when
it
would
impair
their
value
,
and
would
be
obviously
against
the
interests
of
their
masters
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Is
it
the
interest
of
any
man
to
steal
,
to
game
,
to
waste
his
health
and
mental
faculties
by
drunkenness
,
to
lie
,
forswear
himself
,
indulge
hatred
,
seek
desperate
revenge
,
or
do
murder
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
All
these
are
roads
to
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
And
why
,
then
,
do
men
tread
them
?
<EOS>
Because
such
inclinations
are
among
the
vicious
qualities
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
Blot
out
,
ye
friends
of
slavery
,
from
the
catalogue
of
human
passions
,
brutal
lust
,
cruelty
,
and
the
abuse
of
irresponsible
power
(
of
all
earthly
temptations
the
most
difficult
to
be
resisted
)
,
and
when
ye
have
done
so
,
and
not
before
,
we
will
inquire
whether
it
be
the
interest
of
a
master
to
lash
and
maim
the
slaves
,
over
whose
lives
and
limbs
he
has
an
absolute
control
!
   
<EOS>
But
again
:
 
<EOS>
this
class
,
together
with
that
last
one
I
have
named
,
the
miserable
aristocracy
spawned
of
a
false
republic
,
lift
up
their
voices
and
exclaim
"
Public
opinion
is
all
-
sufficient
to
prevent
such
cruelty
as
you
denounce
.
"
 
<EOS>
Public
opinion
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
public
opinion
in
the
slave
States
IS
slavery
,
is
it
not
?
 
<EOS>
Public
opinion
,
in
the
slave
States
,
has
delivered
the
slaves
over
,
to
the
gentle

An

arising
out

facts

<EOS>
A
gentleman
residing
in

had
allowed
an
aged
pair
of
his
slaves
,
substantial
though
not
legal
freedom
for
several
years
.

While
thus
living

a
daughter
was
born
to
them
,
who
grew
up
in
the
same
liberty
,
until
she
married
a
free
negro
,
and
went
with
him
to
reside
in
Pennsylvania
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
several
children
,
and
lived
unmolested
until
the
original
owner
died
,
when
his
heir
attempted
to
regain
them
;
but
the
magistrate
before
whom
they
were
brought

decided
that
he
had
no
jurisdiction
in
the
case

try
this

by
another
test

is
important
in
three
points

first

how

timid
of

public
opinion
slave

owners
are
,
in
their
delicate
descriptions
of
fugitive
slaves
in
widely
circulated

secondly
,
as
showing
how
perfectly
contented
the
slaves
are
,
and
how
very
seldom
they
run
away
;
thirdly
,
as
exhibiting
their
entire
freedom
from
scar
,
or
blemish
,
or
any
mark
of
cruel
infliction
,
as
their
pictures
are
drawn

by

While
upon

of

I
may
observe
that
a

in

once
received
a

's
ear
,
which
had
been
cut
off
close
to

in

letter

<EOS>
It
was
forwarded
by
the

gentleman
who
had
caused
it
to
be
amputated

with
a
polite
request
that
he
would
place
the
specimen
in

hot

innumerable
:
 
<EOS>
but
as
my
readers
will
be
sufficiently
sickened
and
repelled
already
,
I
will
turn
to
another
branch
of
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
These
advertisements
,
of
which
a
similar
collection
might
be
made
for
every
year
,
and
month
,
and
week
,
and
day
;
and
which
are
coolly
read
in

as
things
of
course
,
and
as
a
part
of
the
current
news
and
small
-
talk
;
will
serve
to
show
how
very
much
the
slaves
profit
by
public
opinion
,
and
how
tender
it
is
in
their
behalf
.
<EOS>
But
it
may
be
worth
while
to
inquire
how
the
slave
-
owners
,
and
the
class
of
society
to
which
great
numbers
of
them
belong
,
defer
to
public
opinion
in
their
conduct
,
not
to
their
slaves
but
to
each
other
;
how
they
are
accustomed
to
restrain
their
passions
;
what
their
bearing
is
among
themselves
;
whether
they
are
fierce
or
gentle
;
whether
their
social
customs
be
brutal
,
sanguinary
,
and
violent
,
or
bear
the
impress
of
civilisation
and
refinement
.
   
<EOS>
That
we
may
have
no
partial
evidence
from
abolitionists
in
this
inquiry
,
either
,
I
will
once
more
turn
to
their
own
newspapers
,
and
I
will
confine
myself
,
this
time
,
to
a
selection
from
paragraphs
which
appeared
from
day
to

,
during

refer
to

though
most

the
very
worst

did
,
as
their

constantly
do
;
but
the
position
of
the
scenes
of
action
in
reference
to
places
immediately
at
hand
,
where
slavery
is
the
law
;
and
the
strong
resemblance
between
that
class
of
outrages
and
the
rest
;
lead
to
the
just
presumption
that
the
character
of
the
parties
concerned
was
formed
in
slave
districts
,
and
brutalised
by
slave
customs

<EOS>
THE
AFFAIR
grew
out
of
a
nomination
for
Sheriff
of
Grant
county
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
E
S
Baker
was
nominated
and
supported
by
Mr
Arndt
.
 
<EOS>
This
nomination
was
opposed
by
Vinyard
,
who
wanted
the
appointment
to
vest
in
his
own
brother
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
debate
,
the
deceased
made
some
statements
which
Vinyard
pronounced
false
,
and
made
use
of
violent
and
insulting
language
,
dealing
largely
in
personalities
,
to
which
Mr
A%
made
no
reply
.
 
<EOS>
After
the
adjournment
,
Mr
A%
stepped
up
to
Vinyard
,
and
requested
him
to
retract
,
which
he
refused
to
do
,
repeating
the
offensive
words
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Arndt
then
made
a
blow
at
Vinyard
,
who
stepped
back
a
pace
,
drew
a
pistol
,
and
shot
him
dead
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
issue
appears
to
have
been
provoked
on
the
part
of
Vinyard
,
who
was
determined
at
all
hazards
to
defeat
the
appointment
of
Baker
,
and
who

himself
defeated

turned
his
ire

of

we
learn
the
frightful
death
of
Colonel
Robert

He
was
beset
in

an
enemy
,
named

He
sprang
from

couch
,
seized
his
gun
,
and
,
in
his
night
-
clothes
,
rushed
from
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
For
about
two
hundred
yards
his
speed
seemed
to
defy
his
pursuers
;
but
,
getting
entangled
in
a
thicket
,
he
was
captured

Rose
told
him
THAT

ACT

GENEROUS
PART

give
him
a
chance
for

then
told
Potter
he
might
run
,
and
he
should
not
be
interrupted

he
reached
a
certain
distance

<EOS>
Potter
started
at

word

command
,
and
before
a
gun
was
fired
he
had
reached
the
lake

His
first
impulse
was
to
jump
in
the
water
and
dive
for
it

which
he
did
.

Rose
was
close
behind
him
,

formed
his
men
on
the
bank
ready
to
shoot
him
as
he
rose
.

In
a
few
seconds
he
came
up
to
breathe
;

scarce
had
his
head
reached
the
surface
of
the
water
when
it
was
completely
riddled
with

in
answer
to
those
from

that

Arpin
was
given
to
him

who
was
absent
at

Some
angry
words
then
passed
with
one

a
challenge
followed

the

tried

near

on
Tuesday
the

which
originated
in
settling

AFFAIR
OF
HONOUR

<EOS>
"
We
have
just
heard
the
particulars
of
a
meeting
which
took
place
on
Six
Mile
Island
,
on
Tuesday
,
between
two
young
bloods
of
our
city
:
 
Samuel
Thurston
,
AGED
FIFTEEN
,
and
William
Hine
,
AGED
THIRTEEN
years

<EOS>
They
were
attended
by
young
gentlemen
of
the
same
age
.
 
<EOS>
The
weapons
used
on
the
occasion
,
were
a
couple
of
Dickson
's
best
rifles
;
the
distance
,
thirty
yards
.
 
<EOS>
They
took
one
fire
,
without
any
damage
being
sustained
by
either
party
,
except
the
ball
of
Thurston
's
gun
passing
through
the
crown
of
Hine
's
hat
.
 
<EOS>
THROUGH
THE
INTERCESSION
OF
THE
BOARD
OF
HONOUR
,
the
challenge
was
withdrawn
,
and
the
difference
amicably
adjusted
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
If
the
reader
will
picture
to
himself
the
kind
of
Board
of
Honour
which
amicably
adjusted
the
difference
between
these
two
little
boys
,
who
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
would
have
been
amicably
adjusted
on
two
porters
'
backs
and
soundly
flogged
with
birchen
rods
,
he
will
be
possessed
,
no
doubt
,
with
as
strong
a
sense
of
its
ludicrous
character
,
as
that
which
sets
me
laughing
whenever
its
image
rises
up
before
me
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
I
appeal
to
every
human
mind
,
imbued
with
the
commonest
of
common
sense
,
and
the
commonest
of
common
humanity
;
to
all
dispassionate
,
reasoning
creatures
,
of
any
shade
of
opinion
;
and
ask
,
with
these
revolting
evidences
of
the
state
of
society
which
exists
in
and
about
the
slave
districts
of
America
before
them
,
can
they
have
a
doubt
of
the
real
condition
of
the
slave
,
or
can
they
for
a
moment
make
a
compromise
between
the
institution
or
any
of
its
flagrant
,
fearful
features
,
and
their
own
just
consciences
?
<EOS>
Will
they
say
of
any
tale
of
cruelty
and
horror
,
however
aggravated
in
degree
,
that
it
is
improbable
,
when
they
can
turn
to
the
public
prints
,
and
,
running
,
read
such
signs
as
these
,
laid
before
them
by
the
men
who
rule
the
slaves
:
 
in
their
own
acts
and
under
their
own
hands
?
   
<EOS>
Do
we
not
know
that
the
worst
deformity
and
ugliness
of
slavery
are
at
once
the
cause
and
the
effect
of
the
reckless
license
taken
by
these
freeborn
outlaws
?
 
<EOS>
Do
we
not
know
that
the
man
who
has
been
born
and
bred
among
its
wrongs
;
who
has
seen
in
his
childhood
husbands
obliged
at
the
word
of
command
to
flog
their
wives
;
women
,
indecently
compelled
to
hold
up
their
own
garments
that
men
might
lay
the
heavier
stripes
upon
their
legs
,
driven
and
harried
by
brutal
overseers
in
their
time
of
travail
,
and
becoming
mothers
on
the
field
of
toil
,
under
the
very
lash
itself
;
who
has
read
in
youth
,
and
seen
his
virgin
sisters
read
,
descriptions
of
runaway
men
and
women
,
and
their
disfigured
persons
,
which
could
not
be
published
elsewhere
,
of
so
much
stock
upon
a
farm
,
or
at
a
show
of
beasts
:
---
<EOS>
do
we
not
know
that
that
man
,
whenever
his
wrath
is
kindled
up
,
will
be
a
brutal
savage
?
 
<EOS>
Do
we
not
know
that
as
he
is
a
coward
in
his
domestic
life
,
stalking
among
his
shrinking
men
and
women
slaves
armed
with
his
heavy
whip
,
so
he
will
be
a
coward
out
of
doors
,
and
carrying
cowards
'
weapons
hidden
in
his
breast
,
will
shoot
men
down
and
stab
them
when
he
quarrels
?
 
<EOS>
And
if
our
reason
did
not
teach
us
this
and
much
beyond
;
if
we
were
such
idiots
as
to
close
our
eyes
to
that
fine
mode
of
training
which
rears
up
such
men
;
should
we
not
know
that
they
who
among
their
equals
stab
and
pistol
in
the
legislative
halls
,
and
in
the
counting
-
house
,
and
on
the
marketplace
,
and
in
all
the
elsewhere
peaceful
pursuits
of
life
,
must
be
to
their
dependants
,
even
though
they
were
free
servants
,
so
many
merciless
and
unrelenting
tyrants
?
   
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
shall
we
declaim
against
the
ignorant
peasantry
of
Ireland
,
and
mince
the
matter
when
these
American
taskmasters
are
in
question
?
 
<EOS>
Shall
we
cry
shame
on
the
brutality
of
those
who
hamstring
cattle
:
 
and
spare
the
lights
of
Freedom
upon
earth
who
notch
the
ears
of
men
and
women
,
cut
pleasant
posies
in
the
shrinking
flesh
,
learn
to
write
with
pens
of
red
-
hot
iron
on
the
human
face
,
rack
their
poetic
fancies
for
liveries
of
mutilation
which
their
slaves
shall
wear
for
life
and
carry
to
the
grave
,
breaking
living
limbs
as
did
the
soldiery
who
mocked
and
slew
the
Saviour
of
the
world
,
and
set
defenceless
creatures
up
for
targets
!
<EOS>
Shall
we
whimper
over
legends
of
the
tortures
practised
on
each
other
by
the
Pagan
Indians
,
and
smile
upon
the
cruelties
of
Christian
men
!
 
<EOS>
Shall
we
,
so
long
as
these
things
last
,
exult
above
the
scattered
remnants
of
that
race
,
and
triumph
in
the
white
enjoyment
of
their
possessions
?
 
<EOS>
Rather
,
for
me
,
restore
the
forest
and
the
Indian
village
;
in
lieu
of
stars
and
stripes
,
let
some
poor
feather
flutter
in
the
breeze
;
replace
the
streets
and
squares
by
wigwams
;
and
though
the
death
-
song
of
a
hundred
haughty
warriors
fill
the
air
,
it
will
be
music
to
the
shriek
of
one
unhappy
slave
.

On
one
theme
,
which
is
commonly
before
our
eyes
,
and
in
respect
of
which
our
national
character
is
changing
fast
,
let
the
plain
Truth
be
spoken
,
and
let
us
not
,
like
dastards
,
beat
about
the
bush
by
hinting
at
the
Spaniard
and
the
fierce
Italian
.

When
knives
are
drawn
by
Englishmen
in
conflict
let
it
be
said
and
known
:

"
We
owe
this
change
to
Republican
Slavery

are
the
weapons
of
Freedom

<EOS>
With
sharp
points
and
edges
such
as
these
,
Liberty
in
America
hews
and
hacks
her
slaves
;
or
,
failing
that
pursuit
,
her
sons
devote
them
to
a
better
use

turn
them
on

Concluding
Remarks
 
<EOS>
THERE
are
many
passages
in
this
book
,
where
I
have
been
at
some
pains
to
resist
the
temptation
of
troubling
my
readers
with
my
own
deductions
and
conclusions
:
 
<EOS>
preferring
that
they
should
judge
for
themselves
,
from
such
premises
as
I
have
laid
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
My
only
object
in
the
outset
,
was
,
to
carry
them
with
me
<EOS>
faithfully
wheresoever
<EOS>
I
went
:
 
and
<EOS>
that
task
I
have
discharged
.
   
<EOS>
But
I
may
be
pardoned
,
if
on
such
a
theme
as
the
general
character
of
the
American
people
,
and
the
general
character
of
their
social
system
,
as
presented
to
a
stranger
's
eyes
<EOS>
,
I
desire
to
express
my
own
opinions
in
a
few
words
,
before
I
bring
these
volumes
to
a
close
.
   
<EOS>
They
are
,
by
nature
,
frank
,
brave
,
cordial
,
hospitable
,
and
affectionate
.
 
<EOS>
Cultivation
and
refinement
seem
but
to
enhance
their
warmth
of
heart
and
ardent
enthusiasm
;
and
it
is
the
possession
of
these
latter
qualities
in
a
most
remarkable
degree
,
which
renders
an
educated
American
one
of
the
most
endearing
and
most
generous
of
friends
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
was
so
won
upon
,
as
by
this
class
;
never
yielded
up
my
full
confidence
and
esteem
so
readily
and
pleasurably
,
as
to
them
;
never
can
make
again
,
in
half
a
year
,
so
many
friends
for
whom
I
seem
to
entertain
the
regard
of
half
a
life
.
   
<EOS>
These
qualities
are
natural
,
I
implicitly
believe
,
to
the
whole
people
.
 
<EOS>
That
they
are
,
however
,
sadly
sapped
and
blighted
in
their
growth
among
the
mass
;
and
that
there
are
influences
at
work
which
endanger
them
still
more
,
and
give
but
little
present
promise
of
their
healthy
restoration
;
is
a
truth
that
ought
to
be
told
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
an
essential
part
of
every
national
character
to
pique
itself
mightily
upon
its
faults
,
and
to
deduce
tokens
of
its
virtue
or
its
wisdom
from
their
very
exaggeration
.
 
<EOS>
One
great
blemish
in
the
popular
mind
of
America
,
and
the
prolific
parent
of
an
innumerable
brood
of
evils
,
is
Universal
Distrust
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
the
American
citizen
plumes
himself
upon
this
spirit
,
even
when
he
is
sufficiently
dispassionate
to
perceive
the
ruin
it
works
;
and
will
often
adduce
it
,
in
spite
of
his
own
reason
,
as
an
instance
of
the
great
sagacity
and
acuteness
of
the
people
,
and
their
superior
shrewdness
and
independence
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
carry
,
"
says
the
stranger
,
"
this
jealousy
and
distrust
into
every
transaction
of
public
life
.
 
<EOS>
By
repelling
worthy
men
from
your
legislative
assemblies
,
it
has
bred
up
a
class
of
candidates
for
the
suffrage
,
who
,
in
their
very
act
,
disgrace
your
Institutions
and
your
people
's
choice
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
rendered
you
so
fickle
,
and
so
given
to
change
,
that
your
inconstancy
has
passed
into
a
proverb
;
for
you
no
sooner
set
up
an
idol
firmly
,
than
you
are
sure
to
pull
it
down
and
dash
it
into
fragments
:
 
and
this
,
<EOS>
because
directly
you
reward
a
benefactor
,
or
a
public
servant
,
you
distrust
him
,
merely
because
he
is
rewarded
;
and
immediately
apply
yourselves
to
find
out
,
either
that
you
have
been
too
bountiful
in
your
acknowledgments
,
or
he
remiss
in
his
deserts
.
 
<EOS>
Any
man
who
attains
a
high
place
among
you
,
from
the
President
downwards
,
may
date
his
downfall
from
that
moment
;
for
any
printed
lie
that
any
notorious
villain
pens
,
although
it
militate
directly
against
the
character
and
conduct
of
a
life
,
appeals
at
once
to
your
distrust
,
and
is
believed
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
strain
at
a
gnat
in
the
way
of
trustfulness
and
confidence
,
however
fairly
won
and
well
deserved
;
but
you
will
swallow
a
whole
caravan
of
camels
,
if
they
be
laden
with
unworthy
doubts
and
mean
suspicions
.
 
<EOS>
Is
this
well
,
think
you
,
or
likely
to
elevate
the
character
of
the
governors
or
the
governed
,
among
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
answer
is
invariably
the
same
:
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
freedom
of
opinion
here
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Every
man
thinks
for
himself
,
and
we
are
not
to
be
easily
overreached
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
how
our
people
come
to
be
suspicious
.
"
   
<EOS>
Another
prominent
feature
is
the
love
of
"
smart
"
dealing
:
 
which
gilds
over
many
a
swindle
and
gross
breach
of
trust
;
many
a
defalcation
,
public
and
private
;
and
enables
many
a
knave
to
hold
his
head
up
with
the
best
,
who
well
deserves
a
halter
;
though
it
has
not
been
without
its
retributive
operation
,
for
this
smartness
has
done
more
in
a
few
years
to
impair
the
public
credit
,
and
to
cripple
the
public
resources
,
than
dull
honesty
,
however
rash
,
could
have
effected
in
a
century
.
 
<EOS>
The
merits
of
a
broken
speculation
,
or
a
bankruptcy
,
or
of
a
successful
scoundrel
,
are
not
gauged
by
its
or
his
observance
of
the
golden
rule
,
"
Do
as
you
would
be
done
by
,
"
but
are
considered
with
reference
to
their
smartness
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
,
on
both
occasions
of
our
passing
that
ill
-
fated
Cairo
on
the
Mississippi
,
remarking
on
the
bad
effects
such
gross
deceits
must
have
when
they
exploded
,
in
generating
a
want
of
confidence
abroad
,
and
discouraging
foreign
investment
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
was
given
to
understand
that
this
was
a
very
smart
scheme
by
which
a
deal
of
money
had
been
made
:
 
and
that
its
smartest
feature
was
,
that
they
forgot
these
things
abroad
,
in
a
very
short
time
,
and
speculated
again
,
as
freely
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
The
following
dialogue
<EOS>
I
have
held
a
hundred
times
:
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
a
very
disgraceful
circumstance
that
such
a
man
as
So
-
and
-
so
should
be
acquiring
a
large
property
by
the
most
infamous
and
odious
means
,
and
notwithstanding
all
the
crimes
of
which
he
has
been
guilty
,
should
be
tolerated
and
abetted
by
your
Citizens
?
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
public
nuisance
,
is
he
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
 
"
A
convicted
liar
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
kicked
,
and
cuffed
,
and
caned
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
he
is
utterly
dishonourable
,
debased
,
and
profligate
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
name
of
wonder
,
then
,
what
is
his
merit
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
he
is
a
smart
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
like
manner
,
all
kinds
of
deficient
and
impolitic
usages
are
referred
to
the
national
love
of
trade
;
though
,
oddly
enough
,
it
would
be
a
weighty
charge
against
a
foreigner
that
he
regarded
the
Americans
as
a
trading
people
.
 
<EOS>
The
love
of
trade
is
assigned
as
a
reason
for
that
comfortless
custom
,
so
very
prevalent
in
country
towns
,
of
married
persons
living
in
hotels
,
having
no
fireside
of
their
own
,
and
seldom
meeting
from
early
morning
until
late
at
night
,
but
at
the
hasty
public
meals
.
 
<EOS>
The
love
of
trade
is
a
reason
why
the
literature
of
America
is
to
remain
for
ever
unprotected
"
For
we
are
a
trading
people
,
and
do
n't
care
for
poetry
:
"
<EOS>
though
we
DO
,
by
the
way
,
profess
to
be
very
proud
of
our
poets
:
 
while
healthful
amusements
,
cheerful
means
of
recreation
,
and
wholesome
fancies
,
must
fade
before
the
stern
utilitarian
joys
of
trade
.
   
<EOS>
These
three
characteristics
are
strongly
presented
at
every
turn
,
full
in
the
stranger
's
view
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
foul
growth
of
America
has
a
more
tangled
root
than
this
;
and
it
strikes
its
fibres
,
deep
in
its
licentious
Press
.
   
<EOS>
Schools
may
be
erected
,
East
,
West
,
North
,
and
South
;
pupils
be
taught
,
and
masters
reared
,
by
scores
upon
scores
of
thousands
;
colleges
may
thrive
,
churches
may
be
crammed
,
temperance
may
be
diffused
,
and
advancing
knowledge
in
all
other
forms
walk
through
the
land
with
giant
strides
:
 
but
while
the
newspaper
press
of
America
is
in
,
or
near
,
its
present
abject
state
,
high
moral
improvement
in
that
country
is
hopeless
.
 
<EOS>
Year
by
year
,
it
must
and
will
go
back
;
year
by
year
,
the
tone
of
public
feeling
must
sink
lower
down
;
year
by
year
,
the
Congress
and
the
Senate
must
become
of
less
account
before
all
decent
men
;
and
year
by
year
,
the
memory
of
the
Great
Fathers
of
the
Revolution
must
be
outraged
more
and
more
,
in
the
bad
life
of
their
degenerate
child
.
   
<EOS>
Among
the
herd
of
journals
which
are
published
in
the
States
,
there
are
some
,
the
reader
scarcely
need
be
told
,
of
character
and
credit
.
 
<EOS>
From
personal
intercourse
with
accomplished
gentlemen
connected
with
publications
of
this
class
,
I
have
derived
both
pleasure
and
profit
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
name
of
these
is
Few
,
and
of
the
others
Legion
;
and
the
influence
of
the
good
,
is
powerless
to
counteract
the
moral
poison
of
the
bad
.
   
<EOS>
Among
the
gentry
of
America
;
among
the
well
-
informed
and
moderate
:
in
the
learned
professions
;
at
the
bar
and
on
the
bench
:
 
there
is
,
as
there
can
be
,
but
one
opinion
,
in
reference
to
the
vicious
character
of
these
infamous
journals
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
sometimes
contended
---
I
will
not
say
strangely
,
for
it
is
natural
to
seek
excuses
for
such
a
disgrace
---
that
their
influence
is
not
so
great
as
a
visitor
would
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
be
pardoned
for
saying
that
there
is
no
warrant
for
this
plea
,
and
that
every
fact
and
circumstance
tends
directly
to
the
opposite
conclusion
.
   
<EOS>
When
any
man
,
of
any
grade
of
desert
in
intellect
or
character
,
can
climb
to
any
public
distinction
,
no
matter
what
,
in
America
,
without
first
grovelling
down
upon
the
earth
,
and
bending
the
knee
before
this
monster
of
depravity
;
when
any
private
excellence
is
safe
from
its
attacks
;
when
any
social
confidence
is
left
unbroken
by
it
,
or
any
tie
of
social
decency
and
honour
is
held
in
the
least
regard
;
when
any
man
in
that
free
country
has
freedom
of
opinion
,
and
presumes
to
think
for
himself
,
and
speak
for
himself
,
without
humble
reference
to
a
censorship
which
,
for
its
rampant
ignorance
and
base
dishonesty
,
he
utterly
loathes
and
despises
in
his
heart
;
when
those
who
most
acutely
feel
its
infamy
and
the
reproach
it
casts
upon
the
nation
,
and
who
most
denounce
it
to
each
other
,
dare
to
set
their
heels
upon
,
and
crush
it
openly
,
in
the
sight
of
all
men
:
 
then
,
I
will
believe
that
its
influence
is
lessening
,
and
men
are
returning
to
their
manly
senses
.
 
<EOS>
But
while
that
Press
has
its
evil
eye
in
every
house
,
and
its
black
hand
in
every
appointment
in
the
state
,
from
a
president
to
a
postman
;
while
,
with
ribald
slander
for
its
only
stock
in
trade
,
it
is
the
standard
literature
of
an
enormous
class
,
who
must
find
their
reading
in
a
newspaper
,
or
they
will
not
read
at
all
;
so
long
must
its
odium
be
upon
the
country
's
head
,
and
so
long
must
the
evil
it
works
,
be
plainly
visible
in
the
Republic
.
   
<EOS>
To
those
who
are
accustomed
to
the
leading
English
journals
,
or
to
the
respectable
journals
of
the
Continent
of
Europe
;
to
those
who
are
accustomed
to
anything
else
in
print
and
paper
;
it
would
be
impossible
,
without
an
amount
of
extract
for
which
I
have
neither
space
nor
inclination
,
to
convey
an
adequate
idea
of
this
frightful
engine
in
America
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
any
man
desire
confirmation
of
my
statement
on
this
head
,
let
him
repair
to
any
place
in
this
city
of
London
,
where
scattered
numbers
of
these
publications
are
to
be
found
;
and
there
,
let
him
form
his
own
opinion
.
<EOS>
(

)
   
<EOS>
It
would
be
well
<EOS>
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
,
for
the
American
people
as
a
whole
,
if
they
loved
the
Real
less
,
and
the
Ideal
somewhat
more
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
well
,
if
there
were
greater
encouragement
to
lightness
of
heart
and
gaiety
,
and
a
wider
cultivation
of
what
is
beautiful
,
without
being
eminently
and
directly
useful
.
 
<EOS>
But
here
,
I
think
the
general
remonstrance
,
"
we
are
a
new
country
,
"
which
is
so
often
advanced
as
an
excuse
for
defects
which
are
quite
unjustifiable
,
as
being
,
of
right
,
only
the
slow
growth
of
an
old
one
,
may
be
very
reasonably
urged
:
 
and
I
yet
hope
to
hear
of
there
being
some
other
national
amusement
in
the
United
States
,
besides
newspaper
politics
.
   
<EOS>
They
certainly
are
not
a
humorous
people
,
and
their
temperament
always
impressed
me
is
being
of
a
dull
and
gloomy
character
.
 
<EOS>
In
shrewdness
of
remark
,
and
a
certain
cast
-
iron
quaintness
,
the
Yankees
,
or
people
of
New
England
,
unquestionably
take
the
lead
;
as
they
do
in
most
other
evidences
of
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
travelling
about
,
out
of
the
large
cities
---
as
I
have
remarked
in
former
parts
of
these
volumes
---
I
was
quite
oppressed
by
the
prevailing
seriousness
and
melancholy
air
of
business
:
 
which
was
so
general
and
unvarying
,
that
at
every
new
town
I
came
to
<EOS>
,
I
seemed
to
meet
the
very
same
people
whom
I
had
left
behind
me
,
at
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
Such
defects
as
are
perceptible
in
the
national
manners
,
seem
,
to
me
,
to
be
referable
,
in
a
great
degree
,
to
this
cause
:
 
which
has
generated
a
dull
,
sullen
persistence
in
coarse
usages
,
and
rejected
the
graces
of
life
as
undeserving
of
attention
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
doubt
that
Washington
,
who
was
always
most
scrupulous
and
exact
on
points
of
ceremony
,
perceived
the
tendency
towards
this
mistake
,
even
in
his
time
,
and
did
his
utmost
to
correct
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
can
not
hold
with
other
writers
on
these
subjects
that
the
prevalence
of
various
forms
of
dissent
in
America
,
is
in
any
way
attributable
to
the
non
-
existence
there
of
an
established
church
<EOS>
:
indeed
,
I
think
the
temper
of
the
people
,
if
it
admitted
of
such
an
Institution
being
founded
amongst
them
,
would
lead
them
to
desert
it
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
merely
because
it
WAS
established
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
supposing
it
to
exist
,
I
doubt
its
probable
efficacy
in
summoning
the
wandering
sheep
to
one
great
fold
,
simply
because
of
the
immense
amount
of
dissent
which
prevails
at
home
;
and
because
I
do
not
find
in
America
any
one
form
of
religion
with
which
we
in
Europe
,
or
even
in
England
,
are
unacquainted
.
 
<EOS>
Dissenters
resort
thither
in
great
numbers
,
as
other
people
do
,
simply
because
it
is
a
land
of
resort
;
and
great
settlements
of
them
are
founded
,
because
ground
can
be
purchased
,
and
towns
and
villages
reared
,
where
there
were
none
of
the
human
creation
before
.
 
<EOS>
But
even
the
Shakers
emigrated
from
England
;
our
country
is
not
unknown
to
Mr
Joseph
Smith
,
the
apostle
of
Mormonism
,
or
to
his
benighted
disciples
;
I
have
beheld
religious
scenes
myself
in
some
of
our
populous
towns
which
can
hardly
be
surpassed
by
an
American
camp
-
meeting
;
and
I
am
not
aware
that
any
instance
of
superstitious
imposture
on
the
one
hand
,
and
superstitious
credulity
on
the
other
,
has
had
its
origin
in
the
United
States
,
which
we
can
not
more
than
parallel
by
the
precedents
of
Mrs
Southcote
,
Mary
Tofts
<EOS>
the
rabbit
-
breeder
,
or
even
Mr
Thorn
of
Canterbury
:
 
<EOS>
which
latter
case
arose
,
some
time
after
the
dark
ages
had
passed
away
.
   
<EOS>
The
Republican
Institutions
of
America
undoubtedly
lead
the
people
to
assert
their
self
-
respect
and
their
equality
;
but
a
traveller
is
bound
to
bear
those
Institutions
in
his
mind
,
and
not
hastily
to
resent
the
near
approach
of
a
class
of
strangers
,
who
,
at
home
,
would
keep
aloof
.
 
<EOS>
This
characteristic
,
when
it
was
tinctured
with
no
foolish
pride
,
and
stopped
short
of
no
honest
service
,
never
offended
me
;
and
I
very
seldom
,
if
ever
,
experienced
its
rude
or
unbecoming
display
.
 
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
it
was
comically
developed
,
as
in
the
following
case
;
but
this
was
an
amusing
incident
,
and
not
the
rule
,
or
near
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
wanted
a
pair
of
boots
at
a
certain
town
,
for
I
had
none
to
travel
in
,
but
those
with
the
memorable
cork
soles
,
which
were
much
too
hot
for
the
fiery
decks
of
a
steamboat
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
sent
a
message
to
an
artist
in
boots
,
importing
,
with
my
compliments
,
that
I
should
be
happy
to
see
him
,
if
he
would
do
me
the
polite
favour
to
call
.
 
<EOS>
He
very
kindly
returned
for
answer
,
that
he
would
"
look
round
"
at
six
o'clock
that
evening
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
lying
on
the
sofa
,
with
a
book
and
a
wine
-
glass
,
at
about
that
time
,
when
the
door
opened
,
and
a
gentleman
in
a
stiff
cravat
,
within
a
year
or
two
on
either
side
of
thirty
,
entered
,
in
his
hat
and
gloves
;
walked
up
to
the
looking
-
glass
;
arranged
his
hair
;
took
off
his
gloves
;
slowly
produced
a
measure
from
the
uttermost
depths
of
his
coat
-
pocket
;
and
requested
me
,
in
a
languid
tone
,
to
"
unfix
"
my
straps
.
 
<EOS>
I
complied
,
but
looked
with
some
curiosity
at
his
hat
,
which
was
still
upon
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
that
,
or
it
might
have
been
the
heat
---
but
he
took
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
sat
himself
down
on
a
chair
opposite
to
me
;
rested
an
arm
on
each
knee
;
and
,
leaning
forward
very
much
,
took
from
the
ground
,
by
a
great
effort
,
the
specimen
of
metropolitan
workmanship
which
I
had
just
pulled
off
:
 
whistling
,
pleasantly
,
as
he
did
so
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
it
over
and
over
;
surveyed
it
with
a
contempt
no
language
can
express
;
and
inquired
if
I
wished
him
to
fix
me
a
boot
like
THAT
?
 
<EOS>
I
courteously
replied
,
that
provided
the
boots
were
large
enough
,
I
would
leave
the
rest
to
him
;
that
if
convenient
and
practicable
,
I
should
not
object
to
their
bearing
some
resemblance
to
the
model
then
before
him
;
but
that
I
would
be
entirely
guided
by
,
and
would
beg
to
leave
the
whole
subject
to
,
his
judgment
and
discretion
.
<EOS>
"
You
an't
partickler
,
about
this
scoop
in
the
heel
,
I
suppose
then
?
"
says
he
:
 
<EOS>
"
we
do
n't
foller
that
,
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
repeated
my
last
observation
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
himself
in
the
glass
again
;
went
closer
to
it
to
dash
a
grain
or
two
of
dust
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
;
and
settled
his
cravat
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
my
leg
and
foot
were
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nearly
ready
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
pretty
nigh
,
"
he
said
;
"
keep
steady
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
kept
as
steady
as
I
could
,
both
in
foot
and
face
;
and
having
by
this
time
got
the
dust
out
,
and
found
his
pencil
-
case
,
he
measured
me
,
and
made
the
necessary
notes
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
finished
,
he
fell
into
his
old
attitude
,
and
taking
up
the
boot
again
,
mused
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
this
,
"
he
said
,
at
last
,
"
is
an
English
boot
,
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
London
boot
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
,
sir
,
"
I
replied
,
"
is
a
London
boot
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
mused
over
it
again
,
after
the
manner
of
Hamlet
with
Yorick
's
skull
;
nodded
his
head
,
as
who
should
say
,
"
I
pity
the
Institutions
that
led
to
the
production
of
this
boot
!
"
;
rose
;
put
up
his
pencil
,
notes
,
and
paper
---
glancing
at
himself
in
the
glass
,
all
the
time
---
put
on
his
hat
---
drew
on
his
gloves
very
slowly
;
and
finally
walked
out
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
been
gone
about
a
minute
,
the
door
reopened
,
and
his
hat
and
his
head
reappeared
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
round
the
room
,
and
at
the
boot
again
,
which
was
still
lying
on
the
floor
;
appeared
thoughtful
for
a
minute
;
and
then
said
"
Well
,
good
arternoon
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Good
afternoon
,
sir
,
"
said
I
:
<EOS>
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
interview
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
but
one
other
head
on
which
I
wish
to
offer
a
remark
;
and
that
has
reference
to
the
public
health
.
 
<EOS>
In
so
vast
a
country
,
where
there
are
thousands
of
millions
of
acres
of
land
yet
unsettled
and
uncleared
,
and
on
every
rood
of
which
,
vegetable
decomposition
is
annually
taking
place
;
where
there
are
so
many
great
rivers
,
and
such
opposite
varieties
of
climate
<EOS>
;
there
can
not
fail
to
be
a
great
amount
of
sickness
at
certain
seasons
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
may
venture
to
say
,
after
conversing
with
many
members
of
the
medical
profession
in
America
,
that
I
am
not
singular
in
the
opinion
that
much
of
the
disease
which
does
prevail
,
might
be
avoided
,
if
a
few
common
precautions
were
observed
.
 
<EOS>
Greater
means
of
personal
cleanliness
,
are
indispensable
to
this
end
;
the
custom
of
hastily
swallowing
large
quantities
of
animal
food
,
three
times
a
-
day
,
and
rushing
back
to
sedentary
pursuits
after
each
meal
,
must
be
changed
;
the
gentler
sex
must
go
more
wisely
clad
,
and
take
more
healthful
exercise
;
and
in
the
latter
clause
,
the
males
must
be
included
also
.
 
<EOS>
Above
all
,
in
public
institutions
,
and
throughout
the
whole
of
every
town
and
city
,
the
system
of
ventilation
,
and
drainage
,
and
removal
of
impurities
requires
to
be
thoroughly
revised
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
local
Legislature
in
America
which
may
not
study
Mr
Chadwick
's
excellent
Report
upon
the
Sanitary
Condition
of
our
Labouring
Classes
,
with
immense
advantage
.
   
<EOS>
I
HAVE
now
arrived
at
the
close
of
this
book
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
little
reason
to
believe
,
from
certain
warnings
I
have
had
since
I
returned
to
England
,
that
it
will
be
tenderly
or
favourably
received
by
the
American
people
;
and
as
I
have
written
the
Truth
in
relation
to
the
mass
of
those
who
form
their
judgments
and
express
their
opinions
,
it
will
be
seen
that
I
have
no
desire
to
court
,
by
any
adventitious
means
,
the
popular
applause
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
enough
for
me
,
to
know
,
that
what
I
have
set
down
in
these
pages
,
can
not
cost
me
a
single
friend
on
the
other
side
of
the
Atlantic
,
who
is
,
in
anything
,
deserving
of
the
name
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
rest
,
I
put
my
trust
,
implicitly
,
in
the
spirit
in
which
they
have
been
conceived
and
penned
;
and
I
can
bide
my
time
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
made
no
reference
to
my
reception
,
nor
have
I
suffered
it
to
influence
me
in
what
I
have
written
;
for
,
in
either
case
,
I
should
have
offered
but
a
sorry
acknowledgment
,
compared
with
that
I
bear
within
my
breast
,
towards
those
partial
readers
of
my
former
books
,
across
the
Water
,
who
met
me
with
an
open
hand
,
and
not
with
one
that
closed
upon
an
iron
muzzle
.
