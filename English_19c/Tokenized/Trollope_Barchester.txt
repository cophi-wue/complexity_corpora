Who
Will
Be
the
New
Bishop
?
 
<EOS>
In
the
latter
days
of
July
in
the
year
185
 
,
a
most
important
question
was
for
ten
days
hourly
asked
in
the
cathedral
city
of
Barchester
,
and
answered
every
hour
in
various
ways
 
Who
was
to
be
the
new
bishop
?
  
<EOS>
The
death
of
old
Dr.
Grantly
,
who
had
for
many
years
filled
that
chair
with
meek
authority
,
took
place
exactly
as
the
ministry
of
Lord
 
---
was
going
to
give
place
to
that
of
Lord
 
---
.
<EOS>
The
illness
of
the
good
old
man
was
long
and
lingering
,
and
it
became
at
last
a
matter
of
intense
interest
to
those
concerned
whether
the
new
appointment
should
be
made
by
a
conservative
or
liberal
government
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
pretty
well
understood
that
the
outgoing
premier
had
made
his
selection
and
that
if
the
question
rested
with
him
,
the
mitre
would
descend
on
the
head
of
Archdeacon
<EOS>
Grantly
,
the
old
bishop
's
son
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
had
long
managed
the
affairs
of
the
diocese
,
and
for
some
months
previous
to
the
demise
of
his
father
rumour
had
confidently
assigned
to
him
the
reversion
of
his
father
's
honours
.
  
<EOS>
Bishop
Grantly
died
as
he
had
lived
,
peaceably
,
slowly
,
without
pain
and
without
excitement
.
<EOS>
The
breath
ebbed
from
him
almost
imperceptibly
,
and
for
a
month
before
his
death
it
was
a
question
whether
he
were
alive
or
dead
.
  
<EOS>
A
trying
time
was
this
for
the
archdeacon
,
for
whom
was
designed
the
reversion
of
his
father
's
see
by
those
who
then
had
the
giving
away
of
episcopal
thrones
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
understood
to
say
that
the
prime
minister
had
in
so
many
words
promised
the
bishopric
to
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
He
was
too
discreet
a
man
for
that
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
proverb
with
reference
to
the
killing
of
cats
,
and
those
who
know
anything
either
of
high
or
low
government
places
will
be
well
aware
that
a
promise
may
be
made
without
positive
words
and
that
an
expectant
may
be
put
into
the
highest
state
of
encouragement
,
though
the
great
man
on
whose
breath
<EOS>
he
hangs
may
have
done
no
more
than
whisper
that
"
Mr.
So
-
and
-
So
is
certainly
a
rising
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
Such
a
whisper
had
been
made
,
and
was
known
by
those
who
heard
it
to
signify
that
the
cures
of
the
diocese
of
Barchester
should
not
be
taken
out
of
the
hands
of
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
The
then
prime
minister
was
all
in
all
at
Oxford
,
and
had
lately
passed
a
night
at
the
house
of
the
Master
of
Lazarus
.
<EOS>
Now
the
Master
of
Lazarus
 
which
is
,
by
the
by
,
in
many
respects
the
most
comfortable
as
well
as
the
richest
college
at
Oxford
 
was
the
archdeacon
's
most
intimate
friend
and
most
trusted
counsellor
.
<EOS>
On
the
occasion
of
the
prime
minister
's
visit
,
Dr.
Grantly
was
of
course
present
,
and
the
meeting
was
very
gracious
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
Dr.
Gwynne
,
the
master
,
told
the
archdeacon
that
in
his
opinion
the
thing
was
settled
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
time
the
bishop
was
quite
on
his
last
legs
;
but
the
ministry
also
were
tottering
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
returned
from
Oxford
,
happy
and
elated
,
to
resume
his
place
in
the
palace
and
to
continue
to
perform
for
the
father
the
last
duties
of
a
son
,
which
,
to
give
him
his
due
,
he
performed
with
more
tender
care
than
was
to
be
expected
from
his
usual
somewhat
worldly
manners
.
  
<EOS>
A
month
since
,
the
physicians
had
named
four
weeks
as
the
outside
period
during
which
breath
could
be
supported
within
the
body
of
the
dying
man
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
the
month
the
physicians
wondered
,
and
named
another
fortnight
.
<EOS>
The
old
man
lived
on
wine
alone
,
but
at
the
end
of
the
fortnight
he
still
lived
,
and
the
tidings
of
the
fall
of
the
ministry
became
more
frequent
.
<EOS>
Sir
Lamda
Mewnew
and
Sir
Omicron
Pie
,
the
two
great
London
doctors
,
now
came
down
for
the
fifth
time
and
declared
,
shaking
their
learned
heads
,
that
another
week
of
life
was
impossible
;
and
as
they
sat
down
to
lunch
in
the
episcopal
dining
-
room
,
whispered
to
the
archdeacon
their
own
private
knowledge
that
the
ministry
must
fall
within
five
days
.
<EOS>
The
son
returned
to
his
father
's
room
and
,
after
administering
with
his
own
hands
the
sustaining
modicum
of
madeira
,
sat
down
by
the
bedside
to
calculate
his
chances
.
  
<EOS>
The
ministry
were
to
be
out
within
five
days
:
his
father
was
to
be
dead
within
 
<EOS>
no
,
he
rejected
that
view
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
The
ministry
were
to
be
out
,
and
the
diocese
might
probably
be
vacant
at
the
same
period
.
<EOS>
There
was
much
doubt
as
to
the
names
of
the
men
who
were
to
succeed
to
power
,
and
a
week
must
elapse
before
a
cabinet
was
formed
.
<EOS>
Would
not
vacancies
be
filled
by
the
outgoing
men
during
this
week
?
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
had
a
kind
of
idea
that
such
would
be
the
case
but
did
not
know
,
and
then
he
wondered
at
his
own
ignorance
on
such
a
question
.
  
<EOS>
He
tried
to
keep
his
mind
away
from
the
subject
,
but
he
could
not
.
<EOS>
The
race
was
so
very
close
,
and
the
stakes
were
so
very
high
.
<EOS>
He
then
looked
at
the
dying
man
's
impassive
,
placid
face
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
sign
there
of
death
or
disease
;
it
was
something
thinner
than
of
yore
,
somewhat
grayer
,
and
the
deep
lines
of
age
more
marked
;
but
,
as
far
as
he
could
judge
,
life
might
yet
hang
there
for
weeks
to
come
.
<EOS>
Sir
Lamda
Mewnew
and
Sir
Omicron
Pie
had
thrice
been
wrong
,
and
might
yet
be
wrong
thrice
again
.
<EOS>
The
old
bishop
slept
during
twenty
of
the
twenty
-
four
hours
,
but
during
the
short
periods
of
his
waking
moments
,
he
knew
both
his
son
and
his
dear
old
friend
,
Mr.
Harding
,
the
archdeacon
's
father
-
in
-
law
,
and
would
thank
them
tenderly
for
their
care
and
love
.
<EOS>
Now
he
lay
sleeping
like
a
baby
,
resting
easily
on
his
back
,
his
mouth
just
open
,
and
his
few
gray
hairs
straggling
from
beneath
his
cap
;
his
breath
was
perfectly
noiseless
,
and
his
thin
,
wan
hand
,
which
lay
above
the
coverlid
,
never
moved
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
easier
than
the
old
man
's
passage
from
this
world
to
the
next
.
  
<EOS>
But
by
no
means
easy
were
the
emotions
of
him
who
sat
there
watching
.
<EOS>
He
knew
it
must
be
now
or
never
.
<EOS>
He
was
already
over
fifty
,
and
there
was
little
chance
that
his
friends
who
were
now
leaving
office
would
soon
return
to
it
.
<EOS>
No
probable
British
prime
minister
but
he
who
was
now
in
,
he
who
was
so
soon
to
be
out
,
would
think
of
making
a
bishop
of
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
Thus
he
thought
long
and
sadly
,
in
deep
silence
,
and
then
gazed
at
that
still
living
face
,
and
then
at
last
dared
to
ask
himself
whether
he
really
longed
for
his
father
's
death
.
  
<EOS>
The
effort
was
a
salutary
one
,
and
the
question
was
answered
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
The
proud
,
wishful
,
worldly
man
sank
on
his
knees
by
the
bedside
and
,
taking
the
bishop
's
hand
within
his
own
,
prayed
eagerly
that
his
sins
might
be
forgiven
him
.
  
<EOS>
His
face
was
still
buried
in
the
clothes
when
the
door
of
the
bedroom
opened
noiselessly
and
Mr.
Harding
entered
with
a
velvet
step
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
's
attendance
at
that
bedside
had
been
nearly
as
constant
as
that
of
the
archdeacon
,
and
his
ingress
and
egress
was
as
much
a
matter
of
course
as
that
of
his
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
He
was
standing
close
beside
the
archdeacon
before
he
was
perceived
,
and
would
also
have
knelt
in
prayer
had
he
not
feared
that
his
doing
so
might
have
caused
some
sudden
start
and
have
disturbed
the
dying
man
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
,
however
,
instantly
perceived
him
and
rose
from
his
knees
.
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
Mr.
Harding
took
both
his
hands
and
pressed
them
warmly
.
<EOS>
There
was
more
fellowship
between
them
at
that
moment
than
there
had
ever
been
before
,
and
it
so
happened
that
after
circumstances
greatly
preserved
the
feeling
.
<EOS>
As
they
stood
there
pressing
each
other
's
hands
,
the
tears
rolled
freely
down
their
cheeks
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
my
dears
,
"
said
the
bishop
with
feeble
voice
as
he
woke
.
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
 
<EOS>
may
God
bless
you
both
,
my
dear
children
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
he
died
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
loud
rattle
in
the
throat
,
no
dreadful
struggle
,
no
palpable
sign
of
death
,
but
the
lower
jaw
fell
a
little
from
its
place
,
and
the
eyes
which
had
been
so
constantly
closed
in
sleep
now
remained
fixed
and
open
.
<EOS>
Neither
Mr.
Harding
nor
Dr.
Grantly
knew
that
life
was
gone
,
though
both
suspected
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
's
all
over
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
,
still
pressing
the
other
's
hands
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
 
nay
,
I
hope
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
ring
the
bell
,
"
said
the
other
,
speaking
all
but
in
a
whisper
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Phillips
should
be
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Phillips
,
the
nurse
,
was
soon
in
the
room
,
and
immediately
,
with
practised
hand
,
closed
those
staring
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
over
,
Mrs.
Phillips
?
"
asked
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
's
no
more
,
"
said
Mrs.
Phillips
,
turning
round
and
curtseying
low
with
solemn
face
;
"
his
lordship
's
gone
more
like
a
sleeping
babby
than
any
that
I
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
great
relief
,
Archdeacon
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
,
"
a
great
relief
 
dear
,
good
,
excellent
old
man
.
<EOS>
Oh
that
our
last
moments
may
be
as
innocent
and
as
peaceful
as
his
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
"
said
Mrs.
Phillips
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Lord
be
praised
for
all
his
mercies
;
but
,
for
a
meek
,
mild
,
gentle
-
spoken
Christian
,
his
lordship
was
 
"
and
Mrs.
Phillips
,
with
unaffected
but
easy
grief
,
put
up
her
white
apron
to
her
flowing
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
but
rejoice
that
it
is
over
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
,
still
consoling
his
friend
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
's
mind
,
however
,
had
already
travelled
from
the
death
chamber
to
the
closet
of
the
prime
minister
.
<EOS>
He
had
brought
himself
to
pray
for
his
father
's
life
,
but
now
that
that
life
was
done
,
minutes
were
too
precious
to
be
lost
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
useless
to
dally
with
the
fact
of
the
bishop
's
death
 
useless
to
lose
perhaps
everything
for
the
pretence
of
a
foolish
sentiment
.
  
<EOS>
But
how
was
he
to
act
while
his
father
-
in
-
law
stood
there
holding
his
hand
?
<EOS>
How
,
without
appearing
unfeeling
,
was
he
to
forget
his
father
in
the
bishop
 
to
overlook
what
he
had
lost
,
and
think
only
of
what
he
might
possibly
gain
?
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
suppose
not
,
"
said
he
,
at
last
,
in
answer
to
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
all
expected
it
so
long
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
took
him
by
the
arm
and
led
him
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
see
him
again
to
-
morrow
morning
,
"
said
he
;
"
we
had
better
leave
the
room
now
to
the
women
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
they
went
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
already
evening
and
nearly
dark
.
<EOS>
It
was
most
important
that
the
prime
minister
should
know
that
night
that
the
diocese
was
vacant
.
<EOS>
Everything
might
depend
on
it
;
and
so
,
in
answer
to
Mr.
Harding
's
further
consolation
,
the
archdeacon
suggested
that
a
telegraph
message
should
be
immediately
sent
off
to
London
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
,
who
had
really
been
somewhat
surprised
to
find
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
,
as
he
thought
,
so
much
affected
,
was
rather
taken
aback
,
but
he
made
no
objection
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
the
archdeacon
had
some
hope
of
succeeding
to
his
father
's
place
,
though
he
by
no
means
knew
how
highly
raised
that
hope
had
been
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Dr.
Grantly
,
collecting
himself
and
shaking
off
his
weakness
,
"
we
must
send
a
message
at
once
;
we
do
n't
know
what
might
be
the
consequence
of
delay
.
<EOS>
Will
you
do
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
I
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
;
certainly
.
<EOS>
I
'll
do
anything
,
only
I
do
n't
know
exactly
what
it
is
you
want
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
sat
down
before
a
writing
-
table
and
,
taking
pen
and
ink
,
wrote
on
a
slip
of
paper
as
follows
:
    
By
Electric
Telegraph
.
<EOS>
For
the
Earl
of
 
---
,
Downing
Street
,
or
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Barchester
is
dead
.
<EOS>
Message
sent
by
the
Rev.
Septimus
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
take
that
to
the
telegraph
office
at
the
railway
station
and
give
it
in
as
it
is
<EOS>
;
they
'll
probably
make
you
copy
it
on
to
one
of
their
own
slips
;
that
's
all
you
'll
have
to
do
;
then
you
'll
have
to
pay
them
half
a
crown
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
archdeacon
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
the
necessary
sum
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
felt
very
much
like
an
errand
-
boy
,
and
also
felt
that
he
was
called
on
to
perform
his
duties
as
such
at
rather
an
unseemly
time
,
but
he
said
nothing
,
and
took
the
slip
of
paper
and
the
proffered
coin
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
've
put
my
name
into
it
,
Archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
other
,
"
there
should
be
the
name
of
some
clergyman
,
you
know
,
and
what
name
so
proper
as
that
of
so
old
a
friend
as
yourself
?
<EOS>
The
earl
wo
n't
look
at
the
name
,
you
may
be
sure
of
that
;
but
my
dear
Mr.
Harding
,
pray
do
n't
lose
any
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
got
as
far
as
the
library
door
on
his
way
to
the
station
,
when
he
suddenly
remembered
the
news
with
which
he
was
fraught
when
he
entered
the
poor
bishop
's
bedroom
.
<EOS>
He
had
found
the
moment
so
inopportune
for
any
mundane
tidings
,
that
he
had
repressed
the
words
which
were
on
his
tongue
,
and
immediately
afterwards
all
recollection
of
the
circumstance
was
for
the
time
banished
by
the
scene
which
had
occurred
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Archdeacon
,
"
said
he
,
turning
back
,
"
I
forgot
to
tell
you
 
the
ministry
are
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Out
!
"
ejaculated
the
archdeacon
,
in
a
tone
which
too
plainly
showed
his
anxiety
and
dismay
,
although
under
the
circumstances
of
the
moment
he
endeavoured
to
control
himself
.
"
<EOS>
Out
!
<EOS>
Who
told
you
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
explained
that
news
to
this
effect
had
come
down
by
electric
telegraph
,
and
that
the
tidings
had
been
left
at
the
palace
door
by
Mr.
Chadwick
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
sat
silent
for
awhile
meditating
,
and
Mr.
Harding
stood
looking
at
him
.
"
<EOS>
Never
mind
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
at
last
;
"
send
the
message
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
The
news
must
be
sent
to
someone
,
and
there
is
at
present
no
one
else
in
a
position
to
receive
it
.
<EOS>
Do
it
at
once
,
my
dear
friend
;
you
know
I
would
not
trouble
you
,
were
I
in
a
state
to
do
it
myself
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
"
time
is
of
the
greatest
importance
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
went
out
and
sent
the
message
,
and
it
may
be
as
well
that
we
should
follow
it
to
its
destination
.
<EOS>
Within
thirty
minutes
of
its
leaving
Barchester
it
reached
the
Earl
of
 
---
in
his
inner
library
.
<EOS>
What
elaborate
letters
,
what
eloquent
appeals
,
what
indignant
remonstrances
he
might
there
have
to
frame
,
at
such
a
moment
,
may
be
conceived
but
not
described
!
<EOS>
How
he
was
preparing
his
thunder
for
successful
rivals
,
standing
like
a
British
peer
with
his
back
to
the
sea
-
coal
fire
,
and
his
hands
in
his
breeches
pockets
 
<EOS>
how
his
fine
eye
was
lit
up
with
anger
,
and
his
forehead
gleamed
with
patriotism
 
how
he
stamped
his
foot
as
he
thought
of
his
heavy
associates
 
how
he
all
but
swore
as
he
remembered
how
much
too
clever
one
of
them
had
been
 
<EOS>
my
creative
readers
may
imagine
.
<EOS>
But
was
he
so
engaged
?
<EOS>
No
:
history
and
truth
compel
me
to
deny
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
sitting
easily
in
a
lounging
chair
,
conning
over
a
Newmarket
list
,
and
by
his
elbow
on
the
table
was
lying
open
an
uncut
French
novel
on
which
he
was
engaged
.
  
<EOS>
He
opened
the
cover
in
which
the
message
was
enclosed
and
,
having
read
it
,
he
took
his
pen
and
wrote
on
the
back
of
it
    
For
the
Earl
of
 
---
,
With
the
Earl
of
 
---
"
<EOS>
s
compliments
  
and
sent
it
off
again
on
its
journey
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
terminated
our
unfortunate
friend
's
chances
of
possessing
the
glories
of
a
bishopric
.
  
<EOS>
The
names
of
many
divines
were
given
in
the
papers
as
that
of
the
bishop
-
elect
.
"
<EOS>
The
British
Grandmother
"
declared
that
Dr.
Gwynne
was
to
be
the
man
,
in
compliment
to
the
late
ministry
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
heavy
blow
to
Dr.
Grantly
,
but
he
was
not
doomed
to
see
himself
superseded
by
his
friend
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Anglican
Devotee
"
put
forward
confidently
the
claims
of
a
great
London
preacher
of
austere
doctrines
;
and
"
The
Eastern
Hemisphere
,
"
an
evening
paper
supposed
to
possess
much
official
knowledge
,
declared
in
favour
of
an
eminent
naturalist
,
a
gentleman
most
completely
versed
in
the
knowledge
of
rocks
and
minerals
,
but
supposed
by
many
to
hold
on
religious
subjects
no
special
doctrines
whatever
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
,
"
that
daily
paper
which
,
as
we
all
know
,
is
the
only
true
source
of
infallibly
correct
information
on
all
subjects
,
for
awhile
was
silent
,
but
at
last
spoke
out
.
<EOS>
The
merits
of
all
these
candidates
were
discussed
and
somewhat
irreverently
disposed
of
,
and
then
"
The
Jupiter
"
declared
that
Dr.
Proudie
was
to
be
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
was
the
man
.
<EOS>
Just
a
month
after
the
demise
of
the
late
bishop
,
Dr.
Proudie
kissed
the
Queen
's
hand
as
his
successor
-
elect
.
  
<EOS>
We
must
beg
to
be
allowed
to
draw
a
curtain
over
the
sorrows
of
the
archdeacon
as
he
sat
,
sombre
and
sad
at
heart
,
in
the
study
of
his
parsonage
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
.
<EOS>
On
the
day
subsequent
to
the
dispatch
of
the
message
he
heard
that
the
Earl
of
 
---
had
consented
to
undertake
the
formation
of
a
ministry
,
and
from
that
moment
he
knew
that
his
chance
was
over
.
<EOS>
Many
will
think
that
he
was
wicked
to
grieve
for
the
loss
of
episcopal
power
,
wicked
to
have
coveted
it
,
nay
,
wicked
even
to
have
thought
about
it
,
in
the
way
and
at
the
moments
he
had
done
so
.
  
<EOS>
With
such
censures
I
can
not
profess
that
I
completely
agree
.
<EOS>
The
_
nolo
episcopari
_
,
though
still
in
use
,
is
so
directly
at
variance
with
the
tendency
of
all
human
wishes
,
that
it
can
not
be
thought
to
express
the
true
aspirations
of
rising
priests
in
the
Church
of
England
.
<EOS>
A
lawyer
does
not
sin
in
seeking
to
be
a
judge
,
or
in
compassing
his
wishes
by
all
honest
means
.
<EOS>
A
young
diplomat
entertains
a
fair
ambition
when
he
looks
forward
to
be
the
lord
of
a
first
-
rate
embassy
;
and
a
poor
novelist
,
when
he
attempts
to
rival
Dickens
or
rise
above
Fitzjeames
,
commits
no
fault
,
though
he
may
be
foolish
.
<EOS>
Sydney
Smith
truly
said
that
in
these
recreant
days
we
can
not
expect
to
find
the
majesty
of
St.
Paul
beneath
the
cassock
of
a
curate
.
<EOS>
If
we
look
to
our
clergymen
to
be
more
than
men
,
we
shall
probably
teach
ourselves
to
think
that
they
are
less
,
and
can
hardly
hope
to
raise
the
character
of
the
pastor
by
denying
to
him
the
right
to
entertain
the
aspirations
of
a
man
.
  
<EOS>
Our
archdeacon
was
worldly
 
who
among
us
is
not
so
?
<EOS>
He
was
ambitious
 
who
among
us
is
ashamed
to
own
that
"
last
infirmity
of
noble
minds
!
"
<EOS>
He
was
avaricious
,
my
readers
will
say
.
<EOS>
No
;
 
it
was
for
no
love
of
lucre
that
he
wished
to
be
Bishop
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
He
was
his
father
's
only
child
,
and
his
father
had
left
him
great
wealth
.
<EOS>
His
preferment
brought
him
in
nearly
three
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
The
bishopric
,
as
cut
down
by
the
Ecclesiastical
Commission
,
was
only
five
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
a
richer
man
as
archdeacon
than
he
could
be
as
bishop
.
<EOS>
But
he
certainly
did
desire
to
play
first
fiddle
;
he
did
desire
to
sit
in
full
lawn
sleeves
among
the
peers
of
the
realm
;
and
he
did
desire
,
if
the
truth
must
out
,
to
be
called
"
My
lord
"
by
his
reverend
brethren
.
  
<EOS>
His
hopes
,
however
,
were
they
innocent
or
sinful
,
were
not
fated
to
be
realized
,
and
Dr.
Proudie
was
consecrated
Bishop
of
Barchester
.
   
<EOS>
Hiram
's
Hospital
<EOS>
According
to
Act
of
Parliament
 
<EOS>
It
is
hardly
necessary
that
I
should
here
give
to
the
public
any
lengthened
biography
of
Mr.
Harding
up
to
the
period
of
the
commencement
of
this
tale
.
<EOS>
The
public
can
not
have
forgotten
how
ill
that
sensitive
gentleman
bore
the
attack
that
was
made
on
him
in
the
columns
of
"
The
Jupiter
,
"
with
reference
to
the
income
which
he
received
as
warden
of
Hiram
's
Hospital
,
in
the
city
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
Nor
can
it
yet
be
forgotten
that
a
lawsuit
was
instituted
against
him
on
the
matter
of
that
charity
by
Mr.
John
Bold
,
who
afterwards
married
his
,
Mr.
Harding
's
,
younger
and
then
only
unmarried
daughter
.
<EOS>
Under
pressure
of
these
attacks
,
Mr.
Harding
had
resigned
his
wardenship
,
though
strongly
recommended
to
abstain
from
doing
so
both
by
his
friends
and
by
his
lawyers
.
<EOS>
He
did
,
however
,
resign
it
,
and
betook
himself
manfully
to
the
duties
of
the
small
parish
of
St.
Cuthbert
's
,
in
the
city
,
of
which
he
was
vicar
,
continuing
also
to
perform
those
of
precentor
of
the
cathedral
,
a
situation
of
small
emolument
which
had
hitherto
been
supposed
to
be
joined
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
to
the
wardenship
of
the
hospital
above
spoken
of
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
left
the
hospital
from
which
he
had
been
so
ruthlessly
driven
,
and
settled
himself
down
in
his
own
modest
manner
in
the
High
Street
of
Barchester
,
he
had
not
expected
that
others
would
make
more
fuss
about
it
than
he
was
inclined
to
do
himself
;
and
the
extent
of
his
hope
was
,
that
the
movement
might
have
been
made
in
time
to
prevent
any
further
paragraphs
in
"
The
Jupiter
.
"
<EOS>
His
affairs
,
however
,
were
not
allowed
to
subside
thus
quietly
,
and
people
were
quite
as
much
inclined
to
talk
about
the
disinterested
sacrifice
he
had
made
,
as
they
had
before
been
to
upbraid
him
for
his
cupidity
.
  
<EOS>
The
most
remarkable
thing
that
occurred
was
the
receipt
of
an
autographed
letter
from
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
in
which
the
primate
very
warmly
praised
his
conduct
,
and
begged
to
know
what
his
intentions
were
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
replied
that
he
intended
to
be
rector
of
St.
Cuthbert
's
,
in
Barchester
,
and
so
that
matter
dropped
.
<EOS>
Then
the
newspapers
took
up
his
case
,
"
The
Jupiter
"
among
the
rest
,
and
wafted
his
name
in
eulogistic
strains
through
every
reading
-
room
in
the
nation
.
<EOS>
It
was
discovered
also
that
he
was
the
author
of
that
great
musical
work
,
_
Harding
's
Church
Music
_
,
 
and
a
new
edition
was
spoken
of
,
though
,
I
believe
,
never
printed
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
however
,
certain
that
the
work
was
introduced
into
the
Royal
Chapel
at
St.
James
's
,
and
that
a
long
criticism
appeared
in
the
"
Musical
Scrutator
,
"
declaring
that
in
no
previous
work
of
the
kind
had
so
much
research
been
joined
with
such
exalted
musical
ability
,
and
asserting
that
the
name
of
Harding
would
henceforward
be
known
wherever
the
arts
were
cultivated
,
or
religion
valued
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
high
praise
,
and
I
will
not
deny
that
Mr.
Harding
was
gratified
by
such
flattery
;
for
if
Mr.
Harding
was
vain
on
any
subject
,
it
was
on
that
of
music
.
<EOS>
But
here
the
matter
rested
.
<EOS>
The
second
edition
,
if
printed
,
was
never
purchased
;
the
copies
which
had
been
introduced
into
the
Royal
Chapel
disappeared
again
,
and
were
laid
by
in
peace
,
with
a
load
of
similar
literature
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Towers
of
"
The
Jupiter
"
and
his
brethren
occupied
themselves
with
other
names
,
and
the
undying
fame
promised
to
our
friend
was
clearly
intended
to
be
posthumous
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
had
spent
much
of
his
time
with
his
friend
the
bishop
;
much
with
his
daughter
Mrs.
Bold
,
now
,
alas
,
a
widow
;
and
had
almost
daily
visited
the
wretched
remnant
of
his
former
subjects
,
the
few
surviving
bedesmen
now
left
at
Hiram
's
Hospital
.
<EOS>
Six
of
them
were
still
living
.
<EOS>
The
number
,
according
to
old
Hiram
's
will
,
should
always
have
been
twelve
.
<EOS>
But
after
the
abdication
of
their
warden
,
the
bishop
had
appointed
no
successor
to
him
,
no
new
occupants
of
the
charity
had
been
nominated
,
and
it
appeared
as
though
the
hospital
at
Barchester
would
fall
into
abeyance
,
unless
the
powers
that
be
should
take
some
steps
towards
putting
it
once
more
into
working
order
.
  
<EOS>
During
the
past
five
years
,
the
powers
that
be
had
not
overlooked
Barchester
Hospital
,
and
sundry
political
doctors
had
taken
the
matter
in
hand
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
Mr.
Harding
's
resignation
,
"
The
Jupiter
"
had
very
clearly
shown
what
ought
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
In
about
half
a
column
it
had
distributed
the
income
,
rebuilt
the
buildings
,
put
an
end
to
all
bickerings
,
regenerated
kindly
feeling
,
provided
for
Mr.
Harding
,
and
placed
the
whole
thing
on
a
footing
<EOS>
which
could
not
but
be
satisfactory
to
the
city
and
Bishop
of
Barchester
,
and
to
the
nation
at
large
.
<EOS>
The
wisdom
of
this
scheme
was
testified
by
the
number
of
letters
which
"
Common
Sense
,
"
"
Veritas
,
"
and
"
One
that
loves
fair
play
"
sent
to
"
The
Jupiter
"
,
all
expressing
admiration
and
amplifying
on
the
details
given
.
<EOS>
It
is
singular
enough
that
no
adverse
letter
appeared
at
all
,
and
,
therefore
,
none
of
course
was
written
.
  
<EOS>
But
Cassandra
was
not
believed
,
and
even
the
wisdom
of
"
The
Jupiter
"
sometimes
falls
on
deaf
ears
.
<EOS>
Though
other
plans
did
not
put
themselves
forward
in
the
columns
of
"
The
Jupiter
,
"
reformers
of
church
charities
were
not
slack
to
make
known
in
various
places
their
different
nostrums
for
setting
Hiram
's
Hospital
on
its
feet
again
.
<EOS>
A
learned
bishop
took
occasion
,
in
the
Upper
House
,
to
allude
to
the
matter
,
intimating
that
he
had
communicated
on
the
subject
with
his
right
reverend
brother
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
The
radical
member
for
Staleybridge
had
suggested
that
the
funds
should
be
alienated
for
the
education
of
the
agricultural
poor
of
the
country
,
and
he
amused
the
house
by
some
anecdotes
touching
the
superstition
and
habits
of
the
agriculturists
in
question
.
<EOS>
A
political
pamphleteer
had
produced
a
few
dozen
pages
,
which
he
called
"
Who
are
John
Hiram
's
heirs
?
"
<EOS>
intending
to
give
an
infallible
rule
for
the
governance
of
all
such
establishments
;
and
,
at
last
,
a
member
of
the
government
promised
that
in
the
next
session
a
short
bill
should
be
introduced
for
regulating
the
affairs
of
Barchester
and
other
kindred
concerns
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
session
came
,
and
,
contrary
to
custom
,
the
bill
came
also
.
<EOS>
Men
's
minds
were
then
intent
on
other
things
.
<EOS>
The
first
threatenings
of
a
huge
war
hung
heavily
over
the
nation
,
and
the
question
as
to
Hiram
's
heirs
did
not
appear
to
interest
very
many
people
either
in
or
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
bill
,
however
,
was
read
and
re
-
read
,
and
in
some
undistinguished
manner
passed
through
its
eleven
stages
without
appeal
or
dissent
.
<EOS>
What
would
John
Hiram
have
said
in
the
matter
,
could
he
have
predicted
that
some
forty
-
five
gentlemen
would
take
on
themselves
to
make
a
law
altering
the
whole
purport
of
his
will
,
without
in
the
least
knowing
at
the
moment
of
their
making
it
,
what
it
was
that
they
were
doing
?
<EOS>
It
is
however
to
be
hoped
that
the
under
-
secretary
for
the
Home
Office
knew
,
for
to
him
had
the
matter
been
confided
.
  
<EOS>
The
bill
,
however
,
did
pass
,
and
at
the
time
at
which
this
history
is
supposed
to
commence
,
it
had
been
ordained
that
there
should
be
,
as
heretofore
,
twelve
old
men
in
Barchester
Hospital
,
each
with
1s
.
<EOS>
4d
.
<EOS>
a
day
;
that
there
should
also
be
twelve
old
women
to
be
located
in
a
house
to
be
built
,
each
with
1s
.
<EOS>
2d
.
<EOS>
a
day
;
that
there
should
be
a
matron
,
with
a
house
and
£
70
a
year
;
a
steward
with
£
150
a
year
;
and
latterly
,
a
warden
with
£
450
a
year
,
who
should
have
the
spiritual
guidance
of
both
establishments
,
and
the
temporal
guidance
of
that
appertaining
to
the
male
sex
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
,
dean
,
and
warden
were
,
as
formerly
,
to
appoint
in
turn
the
recipients
of
the
charity
,
and
the
bishop
was
to
appoint
the
officers
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
said
as
to
the
wardenship
being
held
by
the
precentor
of
the
cathedral
,
nor
a
word
as
to
Mr.
Harding
's
right
to
the
situation
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
,
however
,
till
some
months
after
the
death
of
the
old
bishop
,
and
almost
immediately
consequent
on
the
installation
of
his
successor
,
<EOS>
that
notice
was
given
that
the
reform
was
about
to
be
carried
out
.
<EOS>
The
new
law
and
the
new
bishop
were
among
the
earliest
works
of
a
new
ministry
,
or
rather
of
a
ministry
who
,
having
for
awhile
given
place
to
their
opponents
,
had
then
returned
to
power
;
and
the
death
of
Dr.
Grantly
occurred
,
as
we
have
seen
,
exactly
at
the
period
of
the
change
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Eleanor
Bold
!
<EOS>
How
well
does
that
widow
's
cap
become
her
,
and
the
solemn
gravity
with
which
she
devotes
herself
to
her
new
duties
.
<EOS>
Poor
Eleanor
!
  
<EOS>
Poor
Eleanor
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
with
me
John
Bold
was
ever
a
favourite
.
<EOS>
I
never
thought
him
worthy
of
the
wife
he
had
won
.
<EOS>
But
in
her
estimation
he
was
most
worthy
.
<EOS>
Hers
was
one
of
those
feminine
hearts
which
cling
to
a
husband
,
not
with
idolatry
,
for
worship
can
admit
of
no
defect
in
its
idol
,
but
with
the
perfect
tenacity
of
ivy
.
<EOS>
As
the
parasite
plant
will
follow
even
the
defects
of
the
trunk
which
it
embraces
,
so
did
Eleanor
cling
to
and
love
the
very
faults
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
had
once
declared
that
whatever
her
father
did
should
in
her
eyes
be
right
.
<EOS>
She
then
transferred
her
allegiance
,
and
became
ever
ready
to
defend
the
worst
failings
of
her
lord
and
master
.
  
<EOS>
And
John
Bold
was
a
man
to
be
loved
by
a
woman
;
he
was
himself
affectionate
;
he
was
confiding
and
manly
;
and
that
arrogance
of
thought
,
unsustained
by
first
-
rate
abilities
,
that
attempt
at
being
better
than
his
neighbours
which
jarred
so
painfully
on
the
feelings
of
his
acquaintance
,
did
not
injure
him
in
the
estimation
of
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Could
she
even
have
admitted
that
he
had
a
fault
,
his
early
death
would
have
blotted
out
the
memory
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
wept
as
for
the
loss
of
the
most
perfect
treasure
with
which
mortal
woman
had
ever
been
endowed
;
for
weeks
after
he
was
gone
the
idea
of
future
happiness
in
this
world
<EOS>
was
hateful
to
her
;
consolation
,
as
it
is
called
,
was
insupportable
,
and
tears
and
sleep
were
her
only
relief
.
  
<EOS>
But
God
tempers
the
wind
to
the
shorn
lamb
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
she
had
within
her
the
living
source
of
other
cares
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
there
was
to
be
created
for
her
another
subject
of
weal
or
woe
,
of
unutterable
joy
or
despairing
sorrow
,
as
God
in
his
mercy
might
vouchsafe
to
her
.
<EOS>
At
first
this
did
but
augment
her
grief
!
<EOS>
To
be
the
mother
of
a
poor
infant
,
orphaned
before
it
was
born
,
brought
forth
to
the
sorrows
of
an
ever
desolate
hearth
,
nurtured
amidst
tears
and
wailing
,
and
then
turned
adrift
into
the
world
without
the
aid
of
a
father
's
care
!
<EOS>
There
was
at
first
no
joy
in
this
.
  
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
however
,
her
heart
became
anxious
for
another
object
,
and
,
before
its
birth
,
the
stranger
was
expected
with
all
the
eagerness
of
a
longing
mother
.
<EOS>
Just
eight
months
after
the
father
's
death
a
second
John
Bold
was
born
,
and
if
the
worship
of
one
creature
can
be
innocent
in
another
,
let
us
hope
that
the
adoration
offered
over
the
cradle
of
the
fatherless
infant
may
not
be
imputed
as
a
sin
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
worth
our
while
to
define
the
character
of
the
child
,
or
to
point
out
in
how
far
the
faults
of
the
father
were
redeemed
within
that
little
breast
by
the
virtues
of
the
mother
.
<EOS>
The
baby
,
as
a
baby
,
was
all
that
was
delightful
,
and
I
can
not
foresee
that
it
will
be
necessary
for
us
to
inquire
into
the
facts
of
his
after
-
life
.
<EOS>
Our
present
business
at
Barchester
will
not
occupy
us
above
a
year
or
two
at
the
furthest
,
and
I
will
leave
it
to
some
other
pen
to
produce
,
if
necessary
,
the
biography
of
John
Bold
the
Younger
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
as
a
baby
,
this
baby
was
all
that
could
be
desired
.
<EOS>
This
fact
no
one
attempted
to
deny
.
<EOS>
"
Is
he
not
delightful
?
"
she
would
say
to
her
father
,
looking
up
into
his
face
from
her
knees
,
her
lustrous
eyes
overflowing
with
soft
tears
,
her
young
face
encircled
by
her
close
widow
's
cap
,
and
her
hands
on
each
side
of
the
cradle
in
which
her
treasure
was
sleeping
.
<EOS>
The
grandfather
would
gladly
admit
that
the
treasure
was
delightful
,
and
the
uncle
archdeacon
himself
would
agree
,
and
Mrs.
Grantly
,
Eleanor
's
sister
,
would
re
-
echo
the
word
with
true
sisterly
energy
;
and
Mary
Bold
 
but
Mary
Bold
was
a
second
worshipper
at
the
same
shrine
.
  
<EOS>
The
baby
was
really
delightful
;
he
took
his
food
with
a
will
,
struck
out
his
toes
merrily
whenever
his
legs
were
uncovered
,
and
did
not
have
fits
.
<EOS>
These
are
supposed
to
be
the
strongest
points
of
baby
perfection
,
and
in
all
these
our
baby
excelled
.
  
<EOS>
And
thus
the
widow
's
deep
grief
was
softened
,
and
a
sweet
balm
was
poured
into
the
wound
which
she
had
thought
nothing
but
death
could
heal
.
<EOS>
How
much
kinder
is
God
to
us
than
we
are
willing
to
be
to
ourselves
!
<EOS>
At
the
loss
of
every
dear
face
,
at
the
last
going
of
every
well
-
beloved
one
,
we
all
doom
ourselves
to
an
eternity
of
sorrow
,
and
look
to
waste
ourselves
away
in
an
ever
-
running
fountain
of
tears
.
<EOS>
How
seldom
does
such
grief
endure
!
<EOS>
How
blessed
is
the
goodness
which
forbids
it
to
do
so
!
"
<EOS>
Let
me
ever
remember
my
living
friends
,
but
forget
them
as
soon
as
dead
,
"
was
the
prayer
of
a
wise
man
who
understood
the
mercy
of
God
.
<EOS>
Few
perhaps
would
have
the
courage
to
express
such
a
wish
,
and
yet
to
do
so
would
only
be
to
ask
for
that
release
from
sorrow
which
a
kind
Creator
almost
always
extends
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
not
,
however
,
have
it
imagined
that
Mrs.
Bold
forgot
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
daily
thought
of
him
with
all
conjugal
love
,
and
enshrined
his
memory
in
the
innermost
centre
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
But
yet
she
was
happy
in
her
baby
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
sweet
to
press
the
living
toy
to
her
breast
,
and
feel
that
a
human
being
existed
who
did
owe
,
and
was
to
owe
,
everything
to
her
;
whose
daily
food
was
drawn
from
herself
;
whose
little
wants
could
all
be
satisfied
by
her
;
whose
little
heart
would
first
love
her
and
her
only
;
whose
infant
tongue
would
make
its
first
effort
in
calling
her
by
the
sweetest
name
a
woman
can
hear
.
<EOS>
And
so
Eleanor
's
bosom
became
tranquil
,
and
she
set
about
her
new
duties
eagerly
and
gratefully
.
  
<EOS>
As
regards
the
concerns
of
the
world
,
John
Bold
had
left
his
widow
in
prosperous
circumstances
.
<EOS>
He
had
bequeathed
to
her
all
that
he
possessed
,
and
that
comprised
an
income
much
exceeding
what
she
or
her
friends
thought
necessary
for
her
.
<EOS>
It
amounted
to
nearly
a
thousand
a
year
;
when
she
reflected
on
its
extent
,
her
dearest
hope
was
to
hand
it
over
,
not
only
unimpaired
but
increased
,
to
her
husband
's
son
,
to
her
own
darling
,
to
the
little
man
who
now
lay
sleeping
on
her
knee
,
happily
ignorant
of
the
cares
which
were
to
be
accumulated
in
his
behalf
.
  
<EOS>
When
John
Bold
died
,
she
earnestly
implored
her
father
to
come
and
live
with
her
,
but
this
Mr.
Harding
declined
,
though
for
some
weeks
he
remained
with
her
as
a
visitor
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
forego
the
possession
of
some
small
home
of
his
own
,
and
so
remained
in
the
lodgings
he
had
first
selected
over
a
chemist
's
shop
in
the
High
Street
of
Barchester
.
   
<EOS>
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Proudie
 
<EOS>
This
narrative
is
supposed
to
commence
immediately
after
the
installation
of
Dr.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
describe
the
ceremony
,
as
I
do
not
precisely
understand
its
nature
.
<EOS>
I
am
ignorant
whether
a
bishop
be
chaired
like
a
member
of
Parliament
,
or
carried
in
a
gilt
coach
like
a
lord
mayor
,
or
sworn
like
a
justice
of
peace
,
or
introduced
like
a
peer
to
the
upper
house
,
or
led
between
two
brethren
like
a
knight
of
the
garter
;
but
I
do
know
that
everything
was
properly
done
,
and
that
nothing
fit
or
becoming
to
a
young
bishop
was
omitted
on
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
was
not
the
man
to
allow
anything
to
be
omitted
that
might
be
becoming
to
his
new
dignity
.
<EOS>
He
understood
well
the
value
of
forms
,
and
knew
that
the
due
observance
of
rank
could
not
be
maintained
unless
the
exterior
trappings
belonging
to
it
were
held
in
proper
esteem
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
born
to
move
in
high
circles
;
at
least
so
he
thought
himself
,
and
circumstances
had
certainly
sustained
him
in
this
view
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
nephew
of
an
Irish
baron
by
his
mother
's
side
,
and
his
wife
was
the
niece
of
a
Scotch
earl
.
<EOS>
He
had
for
years
held
some
clerical
office
appertaining
to
courtly
matters
,
which
had
enabled
him
to
live
in
London
,
and
to
entrust
his
parish
to
his
curate
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
preacher
to
the
royal
beefeaters
,
curator
of
theological
manuscripts
in
the
Ecclesiastical
Courts
,
chaplain
to
the
Queen
's
yeomanry
guard
,
and
almoner
to
his
Royal
Highness
the
Prince
of
Rappe
-
Blankenberg
.
  
<EOS>
His
residence
in
the
metropolis
,
rendered
necessary
by
duties
thus
entrusted
to
him
,
his
high
connexions
,
and
the
peculiar
talents
and
nature
of
the
man
,
recommended
him
to
persons
in
power
,
and
Dr.
Proudie
became
known
as
a
useful
and
rising
clergyman
.
  
<EOS>
Some
few
years
since
,
even
within
the
memory
of
many
who
are
not
yet
willing
to
call
themselves
old
,
a
liberal
clergyman
was
a
person
not
frequently
to
be
met
.
<EOS>
Sydney
Smith
was
such
and
was
looked
on
as
little
better
than
an
infidel
;
a
few
others
also
might
be
named
,
but
they
were
_
rarae
aves
_
and
were
regarded
with
doubt
and
distrust
by
their
brethren
.
<EOS>
No
man
was
so
surely
a
Tory
as
a
country
rector
 
nowhere
<EOS>
were
the
powers
that
be
so
cherished
as
at
Oxford
.
  
<EOS>
When
,
however
,
Dr.
Whately
was
made
an
archbishop
,
and
Dr.
Hampden
some
years
afterwards
regius
professor
,
many
wise
divines
saw
that
a
change
was
taking
place
in
men
's
minds
,
and
that
more
liberal
ideas
would
henceforward
be
suitable
to
the
priests
as
well
as
to
the
laity
.
<EOS>
Clergymen
began
to
be
heard
of
who
had
ceased
to
anathematize
papists
on
the
one
hand
,
or
vilify
dissenters
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
clear
that
High
Church
principles
,
as
they
are
called
,
were
no
longer
to
be
surest
claims
to
promotion
with
at
any
rate
one
section
of
statesmen
,
and
Dr.
Proudie
was
one
among
those
who
early
in
life
adapted
himself
to
the
views
held
by
the
Whigs
on
most
theological
and
religious
subjects
.
<EOS>
He
bore
with
the
idolatry
of
Rome
,
tolerated
even
the
infidelity
of
Socinianism
,
and
was
hand
and
glove
with
the
Presbyterian
Synods
of
Scotland
and
Ulster
.
  
<EOS>
Such
a
man
at
such
a
time
was
found
to
be
useful
,
and
Dr.
Proudie
's
name
began
to
appear
in
the
newspapers
.
<EOS>
He
was
made
one
of
a
commission
who
went
over
to
Ireland
to
arrange
matters
preparative
to
the
working
of
the
national
board
;
he
became
honorary
secretary
to
another
commission
nominated
to
inquire
into
the
revenues
of
cathedral
chapters
;
he
had
had
something
to
do
with
both
the
_
regium
donum
_
and
the
Maynooth
grant
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
not
on
this
account
be
taken
as
proved
that
Dr.
Proudie
was
a
man
of
great
mental
powers
,
or
even
of
much
capacity
for
business
,
for
such
qualities
had
not
been
required
in
him
.
<EOS>
In
the
arrangement
of
those
church
reforms
with
which
he
was
connected
,
the
ideas
and
original
conception
of
the
work
to
be
done
were
generally
furnished
by
the
liberal
statesmen
of
the
day
,
and
the
labour
of
the
details
was
borne
by
officials
of
a
lower
rank
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
however
,
thought
expedient
that
the
name
of
some
clergyman
should
appear
in
such
matters
,
and
as
Dr.
Proudie
had
become
known
as
a
tolerating
divine
,
great
use
of
this
sort
was
made
of
his
name
.
<EOS>
If
he
did
not
do
much
active
good
,
he
never
did
any
harm
;
he
was
amenable
to
those
who
were
really
in
authority
and
,
at
the
sittings
of
the
various
boards
to
which
he
belonged
,
maintained
a
kind
of
dignity
which
had
its
value
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
certainly
possessed
of
sufficient
tact
to
answer
the
purpose
for
which
he
was
required
without
making
himself
troublesome
;
but
it
must
not
therefore
be
surmised
that
he
doubted
his
own
power
,
or
failed
to
believe
that
he
could
himself
take
a
high
part
in
high
affairs
when
his
own
turn
came
.
<EOS>
He
was
biding
his
time
,
and
patiently
looking
forward
to
the
days
when
he
himself
would
sit
authoritative
at
some
board
,
and
talk
and
direct
,
and
rule
the
roost
,
while
lesser
stars
sat
round
and
obeyed
,
as
he
had
so
well
accustomed
himself
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
His
reward
and
his
time
had
now
come
.
<EOS>
He
was
selected
for
the
vacant
bishopric
and
,
on
the
next
vacancy
which
might
occur
in
any
diocese
,
would
take
his
place
in
the
House
of
Lords
,
prepared
to
give
not
a
silent
vote
in
all
matters
concerning
the
weal
of
the
church
establishment
.
<EOS>
Toleration
was
to
be
the
basis
on
which
he
was
to
fight
his
battles
,
and
<EOS>
in
the
honest
courage
of
his
heart
he
thought
no
evil
would
come
to
him
in
encountering
even
such
foes
as
his
brethren
of
Exeter
and
Oxford
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
was
an
ambitious
man
,
and
before
he
was
well
consecrated
Bishop
of
Barchester
,
he
had
begun
to
look
up
to
archiepiscopal
splendour
,
and
the
glories
of
Lambeth
,
or
at
any
rate
of
Bishopsthorpe
.
<EOS>
He
was
comparatively
young
,
and
had
,
as
he
fondly
flattered
himself
,
been
selected
as
possessing
such
gifts
,
natural
and
acquired
,
as
must
be
sure
to
recommend
him
to
a
yet
higher
notice
,
now
that
a
higher
sphere
was
opened
to
him
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
was
,
therefore
,
quite
prepared
to
take
a
conspicuous
part
in
all
theological
affairs
appertaining
to
these
realms
;
and
having
such
views
,
by
no
means
intended
to
bury
himself
at
Barchester
as
his
predecessor
had
done
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
London
should
still
be
his
ground
:
<EOS>
a
comfortable
mansion
in
a
provincial
city
might
be
well
enough
for
the
dead
months
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Dr.
Proudie
had
always
felt
it
necessary
to
his
position
to
retire
from
London
when
other
great
and
fashionable
people
did
so
;
but
London
should
still
be
his
fixed
residence
,
and
it
was
in
London
that
he
resolved
to
exercise
that
hospitality
<EOS>
so
peculiarly
recommended
to
all
bishops
by
St.
Paul
.
<EOS>
How
otherwise
could
he
keep
himself
before
the
world
?
<EOS>
How
else
give
to
the
government
,
in
matters
theological
,
the
full
benefit
of
his
weight
and
talents
?
  
<EOS>
This
resolution
was
no
doubt
a
salutary
one
as
regarded
the
world
at
large
,
but
was
not
likely
to
make
him
popular
either
with
the
clergy
or
people
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
had
always
lived
there
 
in
truth
,
it
was
hard
for
a
bishop
to
be
popular
after
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
His
income
had
averaged
£
9,000
a
year
;
his
successor
was
to
be
rigidly
limited
to
£
5,000
.
<EOS>
He
had
but
one
child
on
whom
to
spend
his
money
;
Dr.
Proudie
had
seven
or
eight
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
man
of
few
personal
expenses
,
and
they
had
been
confined
to
the
tastes
of
a
moderate
gentleman
;
but
Dr.
Proudie
had
to
maintain
a
position
in
fashionable
society
,
and
had
that
to
do
with
comparatively
small
means
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
had
certainly
kept
his
carriage
as
became
a
bishop
,
but
his
carriage
,
horses
,
and
coachman
,
though
they
did
very
well
for
Barchester
,
would
have
been
almost
ridiculous
at
Westminster
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
determined
that
her
husband
's
equipage
should
not
shame
her
,
and
things
on
which
Mrs.
Proudie
resolved
were
generally
accomplished
.
  
<EOS>
From
all
this
it
was
likely
to
result
that
Dr.
Proudie
would
not
spend
much
money
at
Barchester
,
whereas
his
predecessor
had
dealt
with
the
tradesmen
of
the
city
in
a
manner
very
much
to
their
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
The
Grantlys
,
father
and
son
,
had
spent
their
money
like
gentlemen
,
but
it
soon
became
whispered
in
Barchester
that
Dr.
Proudie
was
not
unacquainted
with
those
prudent
devices
by
which
the
utmost
show
of
wealth
is
produced
from
limited
means
.
  
<EOS>
In
person
Dr.
Proudie
is
a
good
-
looking
man
;
spruce
and
dapper
,
and
very
tidy
.
<EOS>
He
is
somewhat
below
middle
height
,
being
about
five
feet
four
;
but
he
makes
up
for
the
inches
which
he
wants
by
the
dignity
with
which
he
carries
those
which
he
has
.
<EOS>
It
is
no
fault
of
his
own
if
he
has
not
a
commanding
eye
,
for
he
studies
hard
to
assume
it
.
<EOS>
His
features
are
well
formed
,
though
perhaps
the
sharpness
of
his
nose
may
give
to
his
face
in
the
eyes
of
some
people
an
air
of
insignificance
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
it
is
greatly
redeemed
by
his
mouth
and
chin
,
of
which
he
is
justly
proud
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
may
well
be
said
to
have
been
a
fortunate
man
,
for
he
was
not
born
to
wealth
,
and
he
is
now
Bishop
of
Barchester
;
nevertheless
,
he
has
his
cares
.
<EOS>
He
has
a
large
family
,
of
whom
the
three
eldest
are
daughters
,
now
all
grown
up
and
fit
for
fashionable
life
;
 
and
he
has
a
wife
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
my
intention
to
breathe
a
word
against
the
character
of
Mrs.
Proudie
,
but
still
I
can
not
think
that
with
all
her
virtues
she
adds
much
to
her
husband
's
happiness
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
that
in
matters
domestic
she
rules
supreme
over
her
titular
lord
,
and
rules
with
a
rod
of
iron
.
<EOS>
Nor
is
this
all
.
<EOS>
Things
domestic
Dr.
Proudie
might
have
abandoned
to
her
,
if
not
voluntarily
,
yet
willingly
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Proudie
is
not
satisfied
with
such
home
dominion
,
and
stretches
her
power
over
all
his
movements
,
and
will
not
even
abstain
from
things
spiritual
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
bishop
is
hen
-
pecked
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
's
wife
,
in
her
happy
home
at
Plumstead
,
knows
how
to
assume
the
full
privileges
of
her
rank
and
express
her
own
mind
in
becoming
tone
and
place
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Grantly
's
sway
,
if
sway
<EOS>
she
has
,
is
easy
and
beneficent
.
<EOS>
She
never
shames
her
husband
;
before
the
world
she
is
a
pattern
of
obedience
;
her
voice
is
never
loud
,
nor
her
looks
sharp
:
doubtless
she
values
power
,
and
has
not
unsuccessfully
striven
to
acquire
it
;
but
she
knows
what
should
be
the
limits
of
a
woman
's
rule
.
  
<EOS>
Not
so
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
This
lady
is
habitually
authoritative
to
all
,
but
to
her
poor
husband
she
is
despotic
.
<EOS>
Successful
as
has
been
his
career
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
,
it
would
seem
that
in
the
eyes
of
his
wife
he
is
never
right
.
<EOS>
All
hope
of
defending
himself
has
long
passed
from
him
;
indeed
he
rarely
even
attempts
self
-
justification
,
and
is
aware
that
submission
produces
the
nearest
approach
to
peace
which
his
own
house
can
ever
attain
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
has
not
been
able
to
sit
at
the
boards
and
committees
to
which
her
husband
has
been
called
by
the
State
,
nor
,
as
he
often
reflects
,
can
she
make
her
voice
heard
in
the
House
of
Lords
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
she
will
refuse
to
him
permission
to
attend
to
this
branch
of
a
bishop
's
duties
;
it
may
be
that
she
will
insist
on
his
close
attendance
to
his
own
closet
.
<EOS>
He
has
never
whispered
a
word
on
the
subject
to
living
ears
,
but
he
has
already
made
his
fixed
resolve
.
<EOS>
Should
such
attempt
be
made
he
will
rebel
.
<EOS>
Dogs
have
turned
against
their
masters
,
and
even
Neapolitans
against
their
rulers
,
when
oppression
has
been
too
severe
.
<EOS>
And
Dr.
Proudie
feels
within
himself
that
if
the
cord
be
drawn
too
tight
,
he
also
can
muster
courage
and
resist
.
  
<EOS>
The
state
of
vassalage
in
which
our
bishop
has
been
kept
by
his
wife
has
not
tended
to
exalt
his
character
in
the
eyes
of
his
daughters
,
who
assume
in
addressing
their
father
too
much
of
that
authority
which
is
not
properly
belonging
,
at
any
rate
,
to
them
.
<EOS>
They
are
,
on
the
whole
,
fine
engaging
young
ladies
.
<EOS>
They
are
tall
and
robust
like
their
mother
,
whose
high
cheek
-
bones
,
and
 
we
may
say
auburn
hair
they
all
inherit
.
<EOS>
They
think
somewhat
too
much
of
their
grand
-
uncles
,
who
have
not
hitherto
returned
the
compliment
by
thinking
much
of
them
.
<EOS>
But
now
that
their
father
is
a
bishop
,
it
is
probable
that
family
ties
will
be
drawn
closer
.
<EOS>
Considering
their
connexion
with
the
church
,
they
entertain
but
few
prejudices
against
the
pleasures
of
the
world
,
and
have
certainly
not
distressed
their
parents
,
as
too
many
English
girls
have
lately
done
,
by
any
enthusiastic
wish
to
devote
themselves
to
the
seclusion
of
a
Protestant
nunnery
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
's
sons
are
still
at
school
.
  
<EOS>
One
other
marked
peculiarity
in
the
character
of
the
bishop
's
wife
must
be
mentioned
.
<EOS>
Though
not
averse
to
the
society
and
manners
of
the
world
,
she
is
in
her
own
way
a
religious
woman
;
and
the
form
in
which
this
tendency
shows
itself
in
her
is
by
a
strict
observance
of
Sabbatarian
rule
.
<EOS>
Dissipation
and
low
dresses
during
the
week
are
,
under
her
control
,
atoned
for
by
three
services
,
an
evening
sermon
read
by
herself
,
and
a
perfect
abstinence
from
any
cheering
employment
on
the
Sunday
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
for
those
under
her
roof
to
whom
the
dissipation
and
low
dresses
are
not
extended
,
her
servants
namely
and
her
husband
,
the
compensating
strictness
of
the
Sabbath
includes
all
.
<EOS>
Woe
betide
the
recreant
housemaid
who
is
found
to
have
been
listening
to
the
honey
of
a
sweetheart
in
the
Regent
's
park
instead
of
the
soul
-
stirring
evening
discourse
of
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Not
only
is
she
sent
adrift
,
but
she
is
so
sent
with
a
character
which
leaves
her
little
hope
of
a
decent
place
.
<EOS>
Woe
betide
the
six
-
foot
hero
who
escorts
Mrs.
Proudie
to
her
pew
in
red
plush
breeches
,
if
he
slips
away
to
the
neighbouring
beer
-
shop
,
instead
of
falling
into
the
back
seat
appropriated
to
his
use
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
has
the
eyes
of
Argus
for
such
offenders
.
<EOS>
Occasional
drunkenness
in
the
week
may
be
overlooked
,
for
six
feet
on
low
wages
are
hardly
to
be
procured
if
the
morals
are
always
kept
at
a
high
pitch
,
but
not
even
for
grandeur
or
economy
will
Mrs.
Proudie
forgive
a
desecration
of
the
Sabbath
.
  
<EOS>
In
such
matters
Mrs.
Proudie
allows
herself
to
be
often
guided
by
that
eloquent
preacher
,
the
Rev.
Mr.
Slope
,
and
as
Dr.
Proudie
is
guided
by
his
wife
,
it
necessarily
follows
that
the
eminent
man
we
have
named
has
obtained
a
good
deal
of
control
over
Dr.
Proudie
in
matters
concerning
religion
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
's
only
preferment
has
hitherto
been
that
of
reader
and
preacher
in
a
London
district
church
;
and
on
the
consecration
of
his
friend
the
new
bishop
,
he
readily
gave
this
up
to
undertake
the
onerous
but
congenial
duties
of
domestic
chaplain
to
his
lordship
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
however
,
on
his
first
introduction
must
not
be
brought
before
the
public
at
the
tail
of
a
chapter
.
   
<EOS>
The
Bishop
's
Chaplain
 
Of
the
Rev.
Mr.
Slope
's
parentage
<EOS>
I
am
not
able
to
say
much
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
it
asserted
that
he
is
lineally
descended
from
that
eminent
physician
who
assisted
at
the
birth
of
Mr.
T.
Shandy
,
and
that
in
early
years
he
added
an
"
e
"
to
his
name
,
for
the
sake
of
euphony
,
as
other
great
men
have
done
before
him
.
<EOS>
If
this
be
so
,
I
presume
he
was
christened
Obadiah
,
for
that
is
his
name
,
in
commemoration
of
the
conflict
in
which
his
ancestor
so
distinguished
himself
.
<EOS>
All
my
researches
on
the
subject
have
,
however
,
failed
in
enabling
me
to
fix
the
date
on
which
the
family
changed
its
religion
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
sizar
at
Cambridge
,
and
had
there
conducted
himself
at
any
rate
successfully
,
for
in
due
process
of
time
<EOS>
he
was
an
M.A.
,
having
university
pupils
under
his
care
.
<EOS>
From
thence
he
was
transferred
to
London
,
and
became
preacher
at
a
new
district
church
built
on
the
confines
of
Baker
Street
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
this
position
when
congenial
ideas
on
religious
subjects
recommended
him
to
Mrs.
Proudie
,
and
the
intercourse
had
become
close
and
confidential
.
  
<EOS>
Having
been
thus
familiarly
thrown
among
the
Misses
Proudie
,
it
was
no
more
than
natural
that
some
softer
feeling
than
friendship
should
be
engendered
.
<EOS>
There
have
been
some
passages
of
love
between
him
and
the
eldest
hope
,
Olivia
,
but
they
have
hitherto
resulted
in
no
favourable
arrangement
.
<EOS>
In
truth
,
Mr.
Slope
,
having
made
a
declaration
of
affection
,
afterwards
withdrew
it
on
finding
that
the
doctor
had
no
immediate
worldly
funds
with
which
to
endow
his
child
,
and
it
may
easily
be
conceived
that
Miss
Proudie
,
after
such
an
announcement
on
his
part
,
was
not
readily
disposed
to
receive
any
further
show
of
affection
.
<EOS>
On
the
appointment
of
Dr.
Proudie
to
the
bishopric
of
Barchester
,
Mr.
Slope
's
views
were
in
truth
somewhat
altered
.
<EOS>
Bishops
,
even
though
they
be
poor
,
can
provide
for
clerical
children
,
and
Mr.
Slope
began
to
regret
that
he
had
not
been
more
disinterested
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
heard
the
tidings
of
the
doctor
's
elevation
than
he
recommenced
his
siege
,
not
violently
,
indeed
,
but
respectfully
,
and
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
Olivia
Proudie
,
however
,
was
a
girl
of
spirit
:
she
had
the
blood
of
two
peers
in
her
veins
,
and
better
still
she
had
another
lover
on
her
books
,
so
Mr.
Slope
sighed
in
vain
,
and
the
pair
soon
found
it
convenient
to
establish
a
mutual
bond
of
inveterate
hatred
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
thought
singular
that
Mrs.
Proudie
's
friendship
for
the
young
clergyman
should
remain
firm
after
such
an
affair
,
but
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
she
had
known
nothing
of
it
.
<EOS>
Though
very
fond
of
Mr.
Slope
herself
,
she
had
never
conceived
the
idea
that
either
of
her
daughters
would
become
so
,
and
remembering
their
high
birth
and
social
advantages
,
expected
for
them
matches
of
a
different
sort
.
<EOS>
Neither
the
gentleman
nor
the
lady
found
it
necessary
to
enlighten
her
.
<EOS>
Olivia
's
two
sisters
had
each
known
of
the
affair
,
as
had
all
the
servants
,
as
had
all
the
people
living
in
the
adjoining
houses
on
either
side
,
but
Mrs.
Proudie
had
been
kept
in
the
dark
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
soon
comforted
himself
with
the
reflexion
that
,
as
he
had
been
selected
as
chaplain
to
the
bishop
,
it
would
probably
be
in
his
power
to
get
the
good
things
in
the
bishop
's
gift
without
troubling
himself
with
the
bishop
's
daughter
,
and
he
found
himself
able
to
endure
the
pangs
of
rejected
love
.
<EOS>
As
he
sat
himself
down
in
the
railway
carriage
,
confronting
the
bishop
and
Mrs.
Proudie
as
they
started
on
their
first
journey
to
Barchester
,
he
began
to
form
in
his
own
mind
a
plan
of
his
future
life
.
<EOS>
He
knew
well
his
patron
's
strong
points
,
but
he
knew
the
weak
ones
as
well
.
<EOS>
He
understood
correctly
enough
to
what
attempts
the
new
bishop
's
high
spirit
would
soar
,
and
he
rightly
guessed
that
public
life
would
better
suit
the
great
man
's
taste
than
the
small
details
of
diocesan
duty
.
  
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
 
he
,
Mr.
Slope
,
 
would
in
effect
be
Bishop
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
Such
was
his
resolve
,
and
to
give
Mr.
Slope
his
due
,
he
had
both
courage
and
spirit
to
bear
him
out
in
his
resolution
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
should
have
a
hard
battle
to
fight
,
for
the
power
and
patronage
of
the
see
would
be
equally
coveted
by
another
great
mind
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
would
also
choose
to
be
Bishop
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
however
,
flattered
himself
that
he
could
outmanoeuvre
the
lady
.
<EOS>
She
must
live
much
in
London
,
while
he
would
always
be
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
She
would
necessarily
remain
ignorant
of
much
,
while
he
would
know
everything
belonging
to
the
diocese
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
doubtless
,
he
must
flatter
and
cajole
,
perhaps
yield
in
some
things
,
but
he
did
not
doubt
of
ultimate
triumph
.
<EOS>
If
all
other
means
failed
,
he
could
join
the
bishop
against
his
wife
,
inspire
courage
into
the
unhappy
man
,
lay
an
axe
to
the
root
of
the
woman
's
power
,
and
emancipate
the
husband
.
  
<EOS>
Such
were
his
thoughts
as
he
sat
looking
at
the
sleeping
pair
in
the
railway
carriage
,
and
Mr.
Slope
is
not
the
man
to
trouble
himself
with
such
thoughts
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
is
possessed
of
more
than
average
abilities
,
and
is
of
good
courage
.
<EOS>
Though
he
can
stoop
to
fawn
,
and
stoop
low
indeed
,
if
need
be
,
he
has
still
within
him
the
power
to
assume
the
tyrant
;
 
and
with
the
power
he
has
certainly
the
wish
.
<EOS>
His
acquirements
are
not
of
the
highest
order
,
but
such
as
they
are
,
they
are
completely
under
control
,
and
he
knows
the
use
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
is
gifted
with
a
certain
kind
of
pulpit
eloquence
,
not
likely
indeed
to
be
persuasive
with
men
,
but
powerful
with
the
softer
sex
.
<EOS>
In
his
sermons
he
deals
greatly
in
denunciations
,
excites
the
minds
of
his
weaker
hearers
with
a
not
unpleasant
terror
,
and
leaves
an
impression
on
their
minds
that
all
mankind
are
in
a
perilous
state
,
and
all
womankind
,
too
,
except
those
who
attend
regularly
to
the
evening
lectures
in
Baker
Street
.
<EOS>
His
looks
and
tones
are
extremely
severe
,
so
much
so
<EOS>
that
one
can
not
but
fancy
that
he
regards
the
greater
part
of
the
world
as
being
infinitely
too
bad
for
his
care
.
<EOS>
As
he
walks
through
the
streets
his
very
face
denotes
his
horror
of
the
world
's
wickedness
,
and
there
is
always
an
anathema
lurking
in
the
corner
of
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
In
doctrine
he
,
like
his
patron
,
is
tolerant
of
dissent
,
if
so
strict
a
mind
can
be
called
tolerant
of
anything
.
<EOS>
With
Wesleyan
-
Methodists
he
has
something
in
common
,
but
his
soul
trembles
in
agony
at
the
iniquities
of
the
Puseyites
.
<EOS>
His
aversion
is
carried
to
things
outward
as
well
as
inward
.
<EOS>
His
gall
rises
at
a
new
church
with
a
high
-
pitched
roof
;
a
full
-
breasted
black
silk
waistcoat
is
with
him
a
symbol
of
Satan
;
and
a
profane
jest
-
book
would
not
,
in
his
view
,
more
foully
desecrate
the
church
seat
of
a
Christian
than
a
book
of
prayer
printed
with
red
letters
and
ornamented
with
a
cross
on
the
back
.
<EOS>
Most
active
clergymen
have
their
hobby
,
and
Sunday
observances
are
his
.
<EOS>
Sunday
,
however
,
is
a
word
which
never
pollutes
his
mouth
 
<EOS>
it
is
always
"
the
Sabbath
.
<EOS>
"
The
"
desecration
of
the
Sabbath
,
"
as
he
delights
to
call
it
,
is
to
him
meat
and
drink
:
he
thrives
upon
that
as
policemen
do
on
the
general
evil
habits
of
the
community
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
loved
subject
of
all
his
evening
discourses
,
the
source
of
all
his
eloquence
,
the
secret
of
all
his
power
over
the
female
heart
.
<EOS>
To
him
the
revelation
of
God
appears
only
in
that
one
law
given
for
Jewish
observance
.
<EOS>
To
him
the
mercies
of
our
Saviour
speak
in
vain
,
to
him
in
vain
has
been
preached
that
sermon
which
fell
from
divine
lips
on
the
mountain
 
<EOS>
"
Blessed
are
the
meek
,
for
they
shall
inherit
the
earth
"
 
<EOS>
"
Blessed
are
the
merciful
,
for
they
shall
obtain
mercy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
him
the
New
Testament
is
comparatively
of
little
moment
,
for
from
it
can
he
draw
no
fresh
authority
for
that
dominion
which
he
loves
to
exercise
over
at
least
a
seventh
part
of
man
's
allotted
time
here
below
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
is
tall
,
and
not
ill
-
made
.
<EOS>
His
feet
and
hands
are
large
,
as
has
ever
been
the
case
with
all
his
family
,
but
he
has
a
broad
chest
and
wide
shoulders
to
carry
off
these
excrescences
,
and
on
the
whole
his
figure
is
good
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
,
however
,
is
not
specially
prepossessing
.
<EOS>
His
hair
is
lank
and
of
a
dull
pale
reddish
hue
.
<EOS>
It
is
always
formed
into
three
straight
,
lumpy
masses
,
each
brushed
with
admirable
precision
and
cemented
with
much
grease
;
two
of
them
adhere
closely
to
the
sides
of
his
face
,
and
the
other
lies
at
right
angles
above
them
.
<EOS>
He
wears
no
whiskers
,
and
is
always
punctiliously
shaven
.
<EOS>
His
face
is
nearly
of
the
same
colour
as
his
hair
,
though
perhaps
a
little
redder
:
it
is
not
unlike
beef
 
beef
,
however
,
one
would
say
,
of
a
bad
quality
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
is
capacious
and
high
,
but
square
and
heavy
and
unpleasantly
shining
.
<EOS>
His
mouth
is
large
,
though
his
lips
are
thin
and
bloodless
;
and
his
big
,
prominent
,
pale
-
brown
eyes
inspire
anything
but
confidence
.
<EOS>
His
nose
,
however
,
is
his
redeeming
feature
:
it
is
pronounced
,
straight
and
well
-
formed
;
though
I
myself
should
have
liked
it
better
did
it
not
possess
a
somewhat
spongy
,
porous
appearance
,
as
though
it
had
been
cleverly
formed
out
of
a
red
-
coloured
cork
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
could
endure
to
shake
hands
with
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
A
cold
,
clammy
perspiration
always
exudes
from
him
,
the
small
drops
are
ever
to
be
seen
standing
on
his
brow
,
and
his
friendly
grasp
is
unpleasant
.
  
<EOS>
Such
is
Mr.
Slope
 
<EOS>
such
is
the
man
who
has
suddenly
fallen
into
the
midst
of
Barchester
Close
,
and
is
destined
there
to
assume
the
station
which
has
heretofore
been
filled
by
the
son
of
the
late
bishop
.
<EOS>
Think
,
<EOS>
oh
,
my
meditative
reader
,
<EOS>
what
an
associate
we
have
here
for
those
comfortable
prebendaries
,
those
gentlemanlike
clerical
doctors
,
those
happy
,
well
-
used
,
well
-
fed
minor
canons
who
have
grown
into
existence
at
Barchester
under
the
kindly
wings
of
Bishop
Grantly
!
  
<EOS>
But
not
as
a
mere
associate
for
these
does
Mr.
Slope
travel
down
to
Barchester
with
the
bishop
and
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
intends
to
be
,
if
not
their
master
,
at
least
the
chief
among
them
.
<EOS>
He
intends
to
lead
and
to
have
followers
;
he
intends
to
hold
the
purse
-
strings
of
the
diocese
and
draw
round
him
an
obedient
herd
of
his
poor
and
hungry
brethren
.
  
<EOS>
And
here
we
can
hardly
fail
to
draw
a
comparison
between
the
archdeacon
and
our
new
private
chaplain
,
and
despite
the
manifold
faults
of
the
former
,
one
can
hardly
fail
to
make
it
much
to
his
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
Both
men
are
eager
,
much
too
eager
,
to
support
and
increase
the
power
of
their
order
.
<EOS>
Both
are
anxious
that
the
world
should
be
priest
-
governed
,
though
they
have
probably
never
confessed
so
much
,
even
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
Both
begrudge
any
other
kind
of
dominion
held
by
man
over
man
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
,
if
he
admits
the
Queen
's
supremacy
in
things
spiritual
,
only
admits
it
as
being
due
to
the
quasi
-
priesthood
conveyed
in
the
consecrating
qualities
of
her
coronation
,
and
he
regards
things
temporal
as
being
by
their
nature
subject
to
those
which
are
spiritual
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
's
ideas
of
sacerdotal
rule
are
of
quite
a
different
class
.
<EOS>
He
cares
nothing
,
one
way
or
the
other
,
for
the
Queen
's
supremacy
;
these
to
his
ears
are
empty
words
,
meaning
nothing
.
<EOS>
Forms
he
regards
but
little
,
and
such
titular
expressions
as
supremacy
,
consecration
,
ordination
,
and
the
like
convey
of
themselves
no
significance
to
him
.
<EOS>
Let
him
be
supreme
who
can
.
<EOS>
The
temporal
king
,
judge
,
or
gaoler
can
work
but
on
the
body
.
<EOS>
The
spiritual
master
,
if
he
have
the
necessary
gifts
and
can
duly
use
them
,
has
a
wider
field
of
empire
.
<EOS>
He
works
upon
the
soul
.
<EOS>
If
he
can
make
himself
be
believed
,
he
can
be
all
powerful
over
those
who
listen
.
<EOS>
If
he
be
careful
to
meddle
with
none
who
are
too
strong
in
intellect
,
or
too
weak
in
flesh
,
he
may
indeed
be
supreme
.
<EOS>
And
such
was
the
ambition
of
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
interfered
very
little
with
the
worldly
doings
of
those
who
were
in
any
way
subject
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
he
omitted
to
notice
misconduct
among
his
clergy
,
immorality
in
his
parish
,
or
omissions
in
his
family
,
but
he
was
not
anxious
to
do
so
where
the
necessity
could
be
avoided
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
troubled
with
a
propensity
to
be
curious
,
and
as
long
as
those
around
him
were
tainted
with
no
heretical
leaning
towards
dissent
,
as
long
as
they
fully
and
freely
admitted
the
efficacy
of
Mother
Church
,
he
was
willing
that
that
mother
should
be
merciful
and
affectionate
,
prone
to
indulgence
,
and
unwilling
to
chastise
.
<EOS>
He
himself
enjoyed
the
good
things
of
this
world
and
liked
to
let
it
be
known
that
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
He
cordially
despised
any
brother
rector
who
thought
harm
of
dinner
-
parties
,
or
dreaded
the
dangers
of
a
moderate
claret
-
jug
;
consequently
,
dinner
-
parties
and
claret
-
jugs
were
common
in
the
diocese
.
<EOS>
He
liked
to
give
laws
and
to
be
obeyed
in
them
implicitly
,
but
he
endeavoured
that
his
ordinances
should
be
within
the
compass
of
the
man
and
not
unpalatable
to
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
had
ruled
among
his
clerical
neighbours
now
for
sundry
years
,
and
as
he
had
maintained
his
power
without
becoming
unpopular
,
it
may
be
presumed
that
he
had
exercised
some
wisdom
.
  
<EOS>
Of
Mr.
Slope
's
conduct
much
can
not
be
said
,
as
his
grand
career
is
yet
to
commence
,
but
it
may
be
premised
that
his
tastes
will
be
very
different
from
those
of
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
He
conceives
it
to
be
his
duty
to
know
all
the
private
doings
and
desires
of
the
flock
entrusted
to
his
care
.
<EOS>
From
the
poorer
classes
he
exacts
an
unconditional
obedience
to
set
rules
of
conduct
,
and
if
disobeyed
he
has
recourse
,
like
his
great
ancestor
,
to
the
fulminations
of
an
Ernulfus
:
"
Thou
shalt
be
damned
in
thy
going
in
and
<EOS>
in
thy
coming
out
 
in
thy
eating
and
thy
drinking
,
"
&
c.
&
c.
&
c.
<EOS>
With
the
rich
,
experience
has
already
taught
him
that
a
different
line
of
action
is
necessary
.
<EOS>
Men
in
the
upper
walks
of
life
do
not
mind
being
cursed
,
and
the
women
,
presuming
that
it
be
done
in
delicate
phrase
,
rather
like
it
.
<EOS>
But
he
has
not
,
therefore
,
given
up
so
important
a
portion
of
believing
Christians
.
<EOS>
With
the
men
,
indeed
,
he
is
generally
at
variance
;
they
are
hardened
sinners
,
on
whom
the
voice
of
the
priestly
charmer
too
often
falls
in
vain
;
but
with
the
ladies
,
old
and
young
,
firm
and
frail
,
devout
and
dissipated
,
he
is
,
as
he
conceives
,
all
powerful
.
<EOS>
He
can
reprove
faults
with
so
much
flattery
and
utter
censure
in
so
caressing
a
manner
that
the
female
heart
,
if
it
glow
with
a
spark
of
Low
Church
susceptibility
,
can
not
withstand
him
.
<EOS>
In
many
houses
he
is
thus
an
admired
guest
:
the
husbands
,
for
their
wives
"
sake
,
are
fain
to
admit
him
;
and
when
once
admitted
it
is
not
easy
to
shake
him
off
.
<EOS>
He
has
,
however
,
a
pawing
,
greasy
way
with
him
,
which
does
not
endear
him
to
those
who
do
not
value
him
for
their
souls
"
sake
,
and
he
is
not
a
man
to
make
himself
at
once
popular
in
a
large
circle
such
as
is
now
likely
to
surround
him
at
Barchester
.
   
<EOS>
A
Morning
Visit
 
<EOS>
It
was
known
that
Dr.
Proudie
would
immediately
have
to
reappoint
to
the
wardenship
of
the
hospital
under
the
act
of
Parliament
to
which
allusion
has
been
made
;
no
one
imagined
that
any
choice
was
left
to
him
 
<EOS>
no
one
for
a
moment
thought
that
he
could
appoint
any
other
than
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
himself
,
when
he
heard
how
the
matter
had
been
settled
,
without
troubling
himself
much
on
the
subject
,
considered
it
as
certain
that
he
would
go
back
to
his
pleasant
house
and
garden
.
<EOS>
And
though
there
would
be
much
that
was
melancholy
,
nay
,
almost
heartrending
,
in
such
a
return
,
he
still
was
glad
that
it
was
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
His
daughter
might
probably
be
persuaded
to
return
there
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
indeed
,
all
but
promised
to
do
so
,
though
she
still
entertained
an
idea
that
that
greatest
of
mortals
,
that
important
atom
of
humanity
,
that
little
god
upon
earth
,
Johnny
Bold
her
baby
,
ought
to
have
a
house
of
his
own
over
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
Such
being
the
state
of
Mr.
Harding
's
mind
in
the
matter
,
he
did
not
feel
any
peculiar
personal
interest
in
the
appointment
of
Dr.
Proudie
to
the
bishopric
.
<EOS>
He
,
as
well
as
others
at
Barchester
,
regretted
that
a
man
should
be
sent
among
them
who
,
they
were
aware
,
was
not
of
their
way
of
thinking
;
but
Mr.
Harding
himself
was
not
a
bigoted
man
on
points
of
church
doctrine
,
and
he
was
quite
prepared
to
welcome
Dr.
Proudie
to
Barchester
in
a
graceful
and
becoming
manner
.
<EOS>
He
had
nothing
to
seek
and
nothing
to
fear
;
he
felt
that
it
behoved
him
to
be
on
good
terms
with
his
bishop
,
and
he
did
not
anticipate
any
obstacle
that
would
prevent
it
.
  
<EOS>
In
such
a
frame
of
mind
he
proceeded
to
pay
his
respects
at
the
palace
the
second
day
after
the
arrival
of
the
bishop
and
his
chaplain
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
go
alone
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
proposed
to
accompany
him
,
and
Mr.
Harding
was
not
sorry
to
have
a
companion
,
who
would
remove
from
his
shoulders
the
burden
of
the
conversation
in
such
an
interview
.
<EOS>
In
the
affair
of
the
consecration
Dr.
Grantly
had
been
introduced
to
the
bishop
,
and
Mr.
Harding
had
also
been
there
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
however
,
kept
himself
in
the
background
,
and
he
was
now
to
be
presented
to
the
great
man
for
the
first
time
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
's
feelings
were
of
a
much
stronger
nature
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
exactly
the
man
to
overlook
his
own
slighted
claims
,
or
to
forgive
the
preference
shown
to
another
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
was
playing
Venus
to
his
Juno
,
and
he
was
prepared
to
wage
an
internecine
war
against
the
owner
of
the
wished
-
for
apple
,
and
all
his
satellites
,
private
chaplains
,
and
others
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
it
behoved
him
also
to
conduct
himself
towards
the
intruder
as
an
old
archdeacon
should
conduct
himself
to
an
incoming
bishop
;
and
though
he
was
well
aware
of
all
Dr.
Proudie
's
abominable
opinions
as
regarded
dissenters
,
church
reform
,
the
hebdomadal
council
,
and
such
like
;
though
he
disliked
the
man
,
and
hated
the
doctrines
,
still
he
was
prepared
to
show
respect
to
the
station
of
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
So
he
and
Mr.
Harding
called
together
at
the
palace
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
was
at
home
,
and
the
two
visitors
were
shown
through
the
accustomed
hall
into
the
well
-
known
room
where
the
good
old
bishop
used
to
sit
.
<EOS>
The
furniture
had
been
bought
at
a
valuation
,
and
every
chair
and
table
,
every
bookshelf
against
the
wall
,
and
every
square
in
the
carpet
was
as
well
known
to
each
of
them
as
their
own
bedrooms
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
they
at
once
felt
that
they
were
strangers
there
.
<EOS>
The
furniture
was
for
the
most
part
the
same
,
yet
the
place
had
been
metamorphosed
.
<EOS>
A
new
sofa
had
been
introduced
,
a
horrid
chintz
affair
,
most
unprelatical
and
almost
irreligious
;
such
a
sofa
as
never
yet
stood
in
the
study
of
any
decent
High
Church
clergyman
of
the
Church
of
England
.
<EOS>
The
old
curtains
had
also
given
way
.
<EOS>
They
had
,
to
be
sure
,
become
dingy
,
and
that
which
had
been
originally
a
rich
and
goodly
ruby
had
degenerated
into
a
reddish
brown
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
,
however
,
thought
the
old
reddish
-
brown
much
preferable
to
the
gaudy
buff
-
coloured
trumpery
moreen
which
Mrs.
Proudie
had
deemed
good
enough
for
her
husband
's
own
room
in
the
provincial
city
of
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
Our
friends
found
Dr.
Proudie
sitting
on
the
old
bishop
's
chair
,
looking
very
nice
in
his
new
apron
;
they
found
,
too
,
Mr.
Slope
standing
on
the
hearth
-
rug
,
persuasive
and
eager
,
just
as
the
archdeacon
used
to
stand
;
but
on
the
sofa
they
also
found
Mrs.
Proudie
,
an
innovation
for
which
a
precedent
might
in
vain
be
sought
in
all
the
annals
of
the
Barchester
bishopric
!
  
<EOS>
There
she
was
,
however
,
and
they
could
only
make
the
best
of
her
.
<EOS>
The
introductions
were
gone
through
in
much
form
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
shook
hands
with
the
bishop
,
and
named
Mr.
Harding
,
who
received
such
an
amount
of
greeting
as
was
due
from
a
bishop
to
a
precentor
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
then
presented
them
to
his
lady
wife
;
the
archdeacon
first
,
with
archidiaconal
honours
,
and
then
the
precentor
with
diminished
parade
.
<EOS>
After
this
Mr.
Slope
presented
himself
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
,
it
is
true
,
did
mention
his
name
,
and
so
did
Mrs.
Proudie
too
,
in
a
louder
tone
,
but
Mr.
Slope
took
upon
himself
the
chief
burden
of
his
own
introduction
.
<EOS>
He
had
great
pleasure
in
making
himself
acquainted
with
Dr.
Grantly
;
he
had
heard
much
of
the
archdeacon
's
good
works
in
that
part
of
the
diocese
in
which
his
duties
as
archdeacon
had
been
exercised
(
thus
purposely
ignoring
the
archdeacon
's
hitherto
unlimited
dominion
over
the
diocese
at
large
)
.
<EOS>
He
was
aware
that
his
lordship
depended
greatly
on
the
assistance
which
Dr.
Grantly
would
be
able
to
give
him
in
that
portion
of
his
diocese
.
<EOS>
He
then
thrust
out
his
hand
and
,
grasping
that
of
his
new
foe
,
bedewed
it
unmercifully
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
in
return
bowed
,
looked
stiff
,
contracted
his
eyebrows
,
and
wiped
his
hand
with
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
Nothing
abashed
,
Mr.
Slope
then
noticed
the
precentor
and
descended
to
the
grade
of
the
lower
clergy
.
<EOS>
He
gave
him
a
squeeze
of
the
hand
,
damp
indeed
,
but
affectionate
,
and
was
very
glad
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
Mr.
 
<EOS>
oh
yes
,
Mr.
Harding
;
he
had
not
exactly
caught
the
name
.
<EOS>
"
Precentor
in
the
cathedral
,
"
surmised
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
confessed
that
such
was
the
humble
sphere
of
his
work
.
<EOS>
"
Some
parish
duty
as
well
,
"
suggested
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
acknowledged
the
diminutive
incumbency
of
St.
Cuthbert
's
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
then
left
him
alone
,
having
condescended
sufficiently
,
and
joined
the
conversation
among
the
higher
powers
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
four
persons
there
,
each
of
whom
considered
himself
the
most
important
personage
in
the
diocese
 
himself
,
indeed
,
or
herself
,
as
Mrs.
Proudie
was
one
of
them
 
and
with
such
a
difference
of
opinion
it
was
not
probable
that
they
would
get
on
pleasantly
together
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
himself
actually
wore
the
visible
apron
,
and
trusted
mainly
to
that
 
to
that
and
his
title
,
both
being
facts
which
could
not
be
overlooked
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
knew
his
subject
and
really
understood
the
business
of
bishoping
,
which
the
others
did
not
,
and
this
was
his
strong
ground
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
had
her
sex
to
back
her
,
and
her
habit
of
command
,
and
was
nothing
daunted
by
the
high
tone
of
Dr.
Grantly
's
face
and
figure
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
only
himself
and
his
own
courage
and
tact
to
depend
on
,
but
he
nevertheless
was
perfectly
self
-
assured
,
and
did
not
doubt
but
that
he
should
soon
get
the
better
of
weak
men
who
trusted
so
much
to
externals
,
as
both
bishop
and
archdeacon
appeared
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
reside
in
Barchester
,
Dr.
Grantly
?
"
asked
the
lady
with
her
sweetest
smile
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
explained
that
he
lived
in
his
own
parish
of
Plumstead
Episcopi
,
a
few
miles
out
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
lady
hoped
that
the
distance
was
not
too
great
for
country
visiting
,
as
she
would
be
so
glad
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
Mrs.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
She
would
take
the
earliest
opportunity
,
after
the
arrival
of
her
horses
at
Barchester
;
their
horses
were
at
present
in
London
;
their
horses
were
not
immediately
coming
down
,
as
the
bishop
would
be
obliged
,
in
a
few
days
,
to
return
to
town
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
was
no
doubt
aware
<EOS>
that
the
bishop
was
at
present
much
called
upon
by
the
"
University
Improvement
Committee
:
"
indeed
,
the
committee
could
not
well
proceed
without
him
,
as
their
final
report
had
now
to
be
drawn
up
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
had
also
to
prepare
a
scheme
for
the
"
Manufacturing
Towns
Morning
and
Evening
Sunday
School
Society
,
"
of
which
he
was
a
patron
,
or
president
,
or
director
,
and
therefore
the
horses
would
not
come
down
to
Barchester
at
present
;
but
whenever
the
horses
did
come
down
,
she
would
take
the
earliest
opportunity
of
calling
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
,
providing
the
distance
was
not
too
great
for
country
visiting
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
made
his
fifth
bow
 
he
had
made
one
at
each
mention
of
the
horses
 
and
promised
that
Mrs.
Grantly
would
do
herself
the
honour
of
calling
at
the
palace
on
an
early
day
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
declared
that
she
would
be
delighted
:
she
had
n't
liked
to
ask
,
not
being
quite
sure
whether
Mrs.
Grantly
had
horses
;
besides
,
the
distance
might
have
been
,
&
c.
&
c.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
again
bowed
but
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
could
have
bought
every
individual
possession
of
the
whole
family
of
the
Proudies
and
have
restored
them
as
a
gift
,
without
much
feeling
the
loss
;
and
had
kept
a
separate
pair
of
horses
for
the
exclusive
use
of
his
wife
since
the
day
of
his
marriage
,
whereas
Mrs.
Proudie
had
been
hitherto
jobbed
about
the
streets
of
London
at
so
much
a
month
,
during
the
season
,
and
at
other
times
had
managed
to
walk
,
or
hire
a
smart
fly
from
the
livery
stables
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
the
arrangements
with
reference
to
the
Sabbath
-
day
schools
generally
pretty
good
in
your
archdeaconry
?
"
asked
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sabbath
-
day
schools
!
"
repeated
the
archdeacon
with
an
affectation
of
surprise
.
"
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
I
ca
n't
tell
;
it
depends
mainly
on
the
parson
's
wife
and
daughters
.
<EOS>
There
is
none
at
Plumstead
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
almost
a
fib
on
the
part
of
the
archdeacon
,
for
Mrs.
Grantly
has
a
very
nice
school
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
it
is
not
a
Sunday
-
school
exclusively
,
and
is
not
so
designated
,
but
that
exemplary
lady
always
attends
there
for
an
hour
before
church
,
and
hears
the
children
say
their
catechism
,
and
sees
that
they
are
clean
and
tidy
for
church
,
with
their
hands
washed
and
their
shoes
tied
;
and
Grisel
and
Florinda
,
her
daughters
,
carry
thither
a
basket
of
large
buns
,
baked
on
the
Saturday
afternoon
,
and
distribute
them
to
all
the
children
not
especially
under
disgrace
,
which
buns
are
carried
home
after
church
with
considerable
content
,
and
eaten
hot
at
tea
,
being
then
split
and
toasted
.
<EOS>
The
children
of
Plumstead
would
indeed
open
their
eyes
if
they
heard
their
venerated
pastor
declare
that
there
was
no
Sunday
-
school
in
his
parish
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
merely
opened
his
wide
eyes
wider
and
slightly
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
,
however
,
prepared
to
give
up
his
darling
project
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
there
is
a
great
deal
of
Sabbath
travelling
here
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
looking
at
the
"
Bradshaw
,
"
I
see
that
there
are
three
trains
in
and
three
out
every
Sabbath
.
<EOS>
Could
nothing
be
done
to
induce
the
company
to
withdraw
them
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
,
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
,
that
a
little
energy
might
diminish
the
evil
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
being
a
director
,
I
really
ca
n't
say
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
can
withdraw
the
passengers
,
the
company
I
dare
say
will
withdraw
the
trains
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
merely
a
question
of
dividends
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
surely
,
Dr.
Grantly
,
"
said
the
lady
;
"
surely
we
should
look
at
it
differently
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
,
for
instance
,
in
our
position
:
surely
we
should
do
all
that
we
can
to
control
so
grievous
a
sin
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
so
,
Mr.
Harding
?
"
<EOS>
and
she
turned
to
the
precentor
,
who
was
sitting
mute
and
unhappy
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
thought
that
all
porters
and
stokers
,
guards
,
brakesmen
,
and
pointsmen
ought
to
have
an
opportunity
of
going
to
church
,
and
he
hoped
that
they
all
had
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
surely
,
surely
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Proudie
,
"
surely
that
is
not
enough
.
<EOS>
Surely
that
will
not
secure
such
an
observance
of
the
Sabbath
as
we
are
taught
to
conceive
is
not
only
expedient
but
indispensable
<EOS>
;
surely
 
"
  
Come
what
come
might
,
Dr.
Grantly
was
not
to
be
forced
into
a
dissertation
on
a
point
of
doctrine
with
Mrs.
Proudie
,
nor
yet
with
Mr.
Slope
,
so
without
much
ceremony
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
sofa
and
began
to
hope
that
Dr.
Proudie
had
found
that
the
palace
repairs
had
been
such
as
to
meet
his
wishes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
said
his
lordship
;
upon
the
whole
he
thought
so
 
upon
the
whole
,
he
did
n't
know
that
there
was
much
ground
for
complaint
;
the
architect
,
perhaps
,
might
have
 
but
<EOS>
his
double
,
Mr.
Slope
,
who
had
sidled
over
to
the
bishop
's
chair
,
would
not
allow
his
lordship
to
finish
his
ambiguous
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
one
point
I
would
like
to
mention
,
Mr.
Archdeacon
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
asked
me
to
step
through
the
premises
,
and
I
see
that
the
stalls
in
the
second
stable
are
not
perfect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
 
there
's
standing
there
for
a
dozen
horses
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
so
,
"
said
the
other
;
"
indeed
,
I
've
no
doubt
of
it
;
but
visitors
,
you
know
,
often
require
so
much
accommodation
.
<EOS>
There
are
so
many
of
the
bishop
's
relatives
who
always
bring
their
own
horses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
promised
that
due
provision
for
the
relatives
"
horses
should
be
made
,
as
far
at
least
as
the
extent
of
the
original
stable
building
would
allow
.
<EOS>
He
would
himself
communicate
with
the
architect
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
the
coach
-
house
,
Dr.
Grantly
,
"
continued
Mr.
Slope
;
"
there
is
really
hardly
room
for
a
second
carriage
in
the
large
coach
-
house
,
and
the
smaller
one
,
of
course
,
holds
only
one
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
the
gas
,
"
chimed
in
the
lady
;
"
there
is
no
gas
through
the
house
,
<EOS>
none
whatever
,
but
in
the
kitchen
and
passages
.
<EOS>
Surely
the
palace
should
have
been
fitted
through
with
pipes
for
gas
,
and
hot
water
too
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
hot
water
laid
on
anywhere
above
the
ground
-
floor
;
surely
there
should
be
the
means
of
getting
hot
water
in
the
bedrooms
without
having
it
brought
in
jugs
from
the
kitchen
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
had
a
decided
opinion
that
there
should
be
pipes
for
hot
water
.
<EOS>
Hot
water
was
very
essential
for
the
comfort
of
the
palace
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
indeed
,
a
requisite
in
any
decent
gentleman
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
remarked
that
the
coping
on
the
garden
wall
was
in
many
places
imperfect
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
had
discovered
a
large
hole
,
<EOS>
evidently
the
work
of
rats
,
in
the
servants
"
hall
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
expressed
an
utter
detestation
of
rats
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
,
he
believed
,
in
this
world
that
he
so
much
hated
as
a
rat
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
,
moreover
,
observed
that
the
locks
of
the
outhouses
were
very
imperfect
:
he
might
specify
the
coal
-
cellar
and
the
woodhouse
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
had
also
seen
that
those
on
the
doors
of
the
servants
'
bedrooms
were
in
an
-
equally
bad
condition
;
indeed
,
the
locks
all
through
the
house
were
old
-
fashioned
and
unserviceable
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
thought
that
a
great
deal
depended
on
a
good
lock
and
quite
as
much
on
the
key
.
<EOS>
He
had
observed
that
the
fault
very
often
lay
with
the
key
,
especially
if
the
wards
were
in
any
way
twisted
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
was
going
on
with
his
catalogue
of
grievances
,
when
he
was
somewhat
loudly
interrupted
by
the
archdeacon
,
who
succeeded
in
explaining
that
the
diocesan
architect
,
or
rather
his
foreman
,
was
the
person
to
be
addressed
on
such
subjects
,
and
that
he
,
Dr.
Grantly
,
had
inquired
as
to
the
comfort
of
the
palace
merely
as
a
point
of
compliment
.
<EOS>
He
was
sorry
,
however
,
that
so
many
things
had
been
found
amiss
:
<EOS>
and
then
he
rose
from
his
chair
to
escape
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
,
though
she
had
contrived
to
lend
her
assistance
in
recapitulating
the
palatial
dilapidations
,
had
not
on
that
account
given
up
her
hold
of
Mr.
Harding
,
nor
ceased
from
her
cross
-
examinations
as
to
the
iniquity
of
Sabbatical
amusements
.
<EOS>
Over
and
over
again
had
she
thrown
out
her
"
Surely
,
surely
,
"
at
Mr.
Harding
's
devoted
head
,
and
ill
had
that
gentleman
been
able
to
parry
the
attack
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
never
before
found
himself
subjected
to
such
a
nuisance
.
<EOS>
Ladies
hitherto
,
when
they
had
consulted
him
on
religious
subjects
,
had
listened
to
what
he
might
choose
to
say
with
some
deference
,
and
had
differed
,
if
they
differed
,
in
silence
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Proudie
interrogated
him
and
then
lectured
.
"
<EOS>
Neither
thou
,
nor
thy
son
,
nor
thy
daughter
,
thy
manservant
,
nor
thy
maidservant
,
"
said
she
impressively
,
and
more
than
once
,
as
though
Mr.
Harding
had
forgotten
the
words
.
<EOS>
She
shook
her
finger
at
him
as
she
quoted
the
favourite
law
,
as
though
menacing
him
with
punishment
,
and
then
called
upon
him
categorically
to
state
whether
he
did
not
think
that
travelling
on
the
Sabbath
was
an
abomination
and
a
desecration
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
had
never
been
so
hard
pressed
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
he
ought
to
rebuke
the
lady
for
presuming
so
to
talk
to
a
gentleman
and
a
clergyman
many
years
her
senior
,
but
he
recoiled
from
the
idea
of
scolding
the
bishop
's
wife
,
in
the
bishop
's
presence
,
on
his
first
visit
to
the
palace
;
moreover
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
he
was
somewhat
afraid
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
,
seeing
him
sit
silent
and
absorbed
,
by
no
means
refrained
from
the
attack
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Mr.
Harding
,
"
said
she
,
shaking
her
head
slowly
and
solemnly
,
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
not
leave
me
to
think
that
you
approve
of
Sabbath
travelling
,
"
and
she
looked
a
look
of
unutterable
meaning
into
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
standing
this
,
for
Mr.
Slope
was
now
looking
at
him
,
and
so
was
the
bishop
,
and
so
was
the
archdeacon
,
who
had
completed
his
adieux
on
that
side
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
therefore
got
up
also
and
,
putting
out
his
hand
to
Mrs.
Proudie
,
said
:
"
If
you
will
come
to
St.
Cuthbert
's
<EOS>
some
Sunday
,
I
will
preach
you
a
sermon
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
the
archdeacon
and
the
precentor
took
their
departure
,
bowing
low
to
the
lady
,
shaking
hands
with
the
lord
,
and
escaping
from
Mr.
Slope
in
the
best
manner
each
could
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
was
again
maltreated
,
but
Dr.
Grantly
swore
deeply
in
the
bottom
of
his
heart
,
that
no
earthly
consideration
should
ever
again
induce
him
to
touch
the
paw
of
that
impure
and
filthy
animal
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
had
I
the
pen
of
a
mighty
poet
,
would
I
sing
in
epic
verse
the
noble
wrath
of
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
The
palace
steps
descend
to
a
broad
gravel
sweep
,
from
whence
a
small
gate
opens
out
into
the
street
,
very
near
the
covered
gateway
leading
into
the
close
.
<EOS>
The
road
from
the
palace
door
turns
to
the
left
,
through
the
spacious
gardens
,
and
terminates
on
the
London
road
,
half
a
mile
from
the
cathedral
.
  
<EOS>
Till
they
had
both
passed
this
small
gate
and
entered
the
close
,
neither
of
them
spoke
a
word
,
but
the
precentor
clearly
saw
from
his
companion
's
face
that
a
tornado
was
to
be
expected
,
nor
was
he
himself
inclined
to
stop
it
.
<EOS>
Though
by
nature
far
less
irritable
than
the
archdeacon
,
even
he
was
angry
:
<EOS>
he
<EOS>
even
 
that
mild
and
courteous
man
 
was
inclined
to
express
himself
in
anything
but
courteous
terms
.
   
<EOS>
War
 
<EOS>
"
Good
heavens
!
"
exclaimed
the
archdeacon
,
as
he
placed
his
foot
on
the
gravel
walk
of
the
close
,
and
raising
his
hat
with
one
hand
,
passed
the
other
somewhat
violently
over
his
now
grizzled
locks
;
smoke
issued
forth
from
the
uplifted
beaver
as
it
were
a
cloud
of
wrath
,
and
the
safety
valve
of
his
anger
opened
,
and
emitted
a
visible
steam
,
preventing
positive
explosion
and
probable
apoplexy
.
"
<EOS>
Good
heavens
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
the
archdeacon
looked
up
to
the
gray
pinnacles
of
the
cathedral
tower
,
making
a
mute
appeal
to
that
still
living
witness
which
had
looked
down
on
the
doings
of
so
many
bishops
of
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
ever
like
that
Mr.
Slope
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
Like
him
!
"
<EOS>
roared
the
archdeacon
,
standing
still
for
a
moment
to
give
more
force
to
his
voice
;
"
like
him
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
All
the
ravens
of
the
close
cawed
their
assent
.
<EOS>
The
old
bells
of
the
tower
,
in
chiming
the
hour
,
echoed
the
words
,
and
the
swallows
flying
out
from
their
nests
mutely
expressed
a
similar
opinion
.
<EOS>
Like
Mr.
Slope
!
<EOS>
Why
no
,
it
was
not
very
probable
that
any
Barchester
-
bred
living
thing
should
like
Mr.
Slope
!
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
Mrs.
Proudie
either
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
hereupon
forgot
himself
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
follow
his
example
,
nor
shock
my
readers
by
transcribing
the
term
in
which
he
expressed
his
feeling
as
to
the
lady
who
had
been
named
.
<EOS>
The
ravens
and
the
last
lingering
notes
of
the
clock
bells
were
less
scrupulous
and
repeated
in
correspondent
echoes
the
very
improper
exclamation
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
again
raised
his
hat
,
and
another
salutary
escape
of
steam
was
effected
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
,
during
which
the
precentor
tried
to
realize
the
fact
that
the
wife
of
a
Bishop
of
Barchester
had
been
thus
designated
,
in
the
close
of
the
cathedral
,
by
the
lips
of
its
own
archdeacon
;
but
he
could
not
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
bishop
seems
to
be
a
quiet
man
enough
,
"
suggested
Mr.
Harding
,
having
acknowledged
to
himself
his
own
failure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Idiot
!
"
exclaimed
the
doctor
,
who
for
the
nonce
was
not
capable
of
more
than
such
spasmodic
attempts
at
utterance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
he
did
not
seem
very
bright
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
,
"
and
yet
he
has
always
had
the
reputation
of
a
clever
man
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
's
cautious
and
not
inclined
to
express
himself
very
freely
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
new
Bishop
of
Barchester
was
already
so
contemptible
a
creature
in
Dr.
Grantly
's
eyes
that
he
could
not
condescend
to
discuss
his
character
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
puppet
to
be
played
by
others
;
a
mere
wax
doll
,
done
up
in
an
apron
and
a
shovel
hat
,
to
be
stuck
on
a
throne
or
elsewhere
,
and
pulled
about
by
wires
as
others
chose
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
did
not
choose
to
let
himself
down
low
enough
to
talk
about
Dr.
Proudie
,
but
he
saw
that
he
would
have
to
talk
about
the
other
members
of
his
household
,
the
coadjutor
bishops
,
who
had
brought
his
lordship
down
,
as
it
were
,
in
a
box
,
and
were
about
to
handle
the
wires
as
they
willed
.
<EOS>
This
in
itself
was
a
terrible
vexation
to
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
Could
he
have
ignored
the
chaplain
and
have
fought
the
bishop
,
there
would
have
been
,
at
any
rate
,
nothing
degrading
in
such
a
contest
.
<EOS>
Let
the
Queen
make
whom
she
would
Bishop
of
Barchester
;
a
man
,
or
even
an
ape
,
when
once
a
bishop
,
would
be
a
respectable
adversary
,
if
he
would
but
fight
,
himself
.
<EOS>
But
what
was
such
a
person
as
Dr.
Grantly
to
do
when
such
another
person
as
Mr.
Slope
was
put
forward
as
his
antagonist
?
  
<EOS>
If
he
,
our
archdeacon
,
refused
the
combat
,
Mr.
Slope
would
walk
triumphant
over
the
field
,
and
have
the
diocese
of
Barchester
under
his
heel
.
  
<EOS>
If
,
on
the
other
hand
,
the
archdeacon
accepted
as
his
enemy
the
man
whom
the
new
puppet
bishop
put
before
him
as
such
,
he
would
have
to
talk
about
Mr.
Slope
,
and
write
about
Mr.
Slope
,
and
in
all
matters
treat
with
Mr.
Slope
,
as
a
being
standing
,
in
some
degree
,
on
ground
similar
to
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
to
meet
Mr.
Slope
,
to
 
Bah
!
<EOS>
the
idea
was
sickening
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bring
himself
to
have
to
do
with
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
the
most
thoroughly
bestial
creature
that
ever
I
set
my
eyes
upon
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
 
the
bishop
?
"
asked
the
other
innocently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bishop
!
<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
I
'm
not
talking
about
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
How
on
earth
such
a
creature
got
ordained
!
 
<EOS>
they
'll
ordain
anybody
now
,
I
know
,
but
he
's
been
in
the
church
these
ten
years
,
and
they
used
to
be
a
little
careful
ten
years
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
You
mean
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Did
you
ever
see
any
animal
less
like
a
gentleman
?
"
asked
Dr.
Grantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
I
felt
myself
much
disposed
to
like
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Like
him
!
"
<EOS>
again
shouted
the
doctor
,
and
the
assenting
ravens
again
cawed
an
echo
;
"
of
course
,
you
do
n't
like
him
:
it
's
not
a
question
of
liking
.
<EOS>
But
what
are
we
to
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
with
him
?
"
asked
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
what
are
we
to
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
How
are
we
to
treat
him
?
<EOS>
There
he
is
,
and
there
he
'll
stay
.
<EOS>
He
has
put
his
foot
in
that
palace
,
and
he
'll
never
take
it
out
again
till
he
's
driven
.
<EOS>
How
are
we
to
get
rid
of
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
he
can
do
us
much
harm
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
do
harm
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
think
you
'll
find
yourself
of
a
different
opinion
before
a
month
is
gone
.
<EOS>
What
would
you
say
now
,
if
he
got
himself
put
into
the
hospital
?
<EOS>
Would
that
be
harm
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
mused
awhile
and
then
said
he
did
n't
think
the
new
bishop
would
put
Mr.
Slope
into
the
hospital
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
does
n't
put
him
there
,
he
'll
put
him
somewhere
else
where
he
'll
be
as
bad
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
that
that
man
,
to
all
intents
and
purposes
,
will
be
Bishop
of
Barchester
!
"
<EOS>
And
again
Dr.
Grantly
raised
his
hat
and
rubbed
his
hand
thoughtfully
and
sadly
over
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Impudent
scoundrel
!
"
<EOS>
he
continued
after
a
while
.
"
<EOS>
To
dare
to
cross
-
examine
me
about
the
Sunday
-
schools
in
the
diocese
,
and
Sunday
travelling
too
:
I
never
in
my
life
met
his
equal
for
sheer
impudence
.
<EOS>
Why
,
he
must
have
thought
we
were
two
candidates
for
ordination
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
I
thought
Mrs.
Proudie
was
the
worst
of
the
two
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
a
woman
is
impertinent
,
one
must
only
put
up
with
it
,
and
keep
out
of
her
way
in
future
,
but
I
am
not
inclined
to
put
up
with
Mr.
Slope
.
"
<EOS>
Sabbath
travelling
!
"
<EOS>
"
and
the
doctor
attempted
to
imitate
the
peculiar
drawl
of
the
man
he
so
much
disliked
:
"
"
Sabbath
travelling
!
<EOS>
"
Those
are
the
sort
of
men
who
will
ruin
the
Church
of
England
and
make
the
profession
of
a
clergyman
disreputable
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
the
dissenters
or
the
papists
that
we
should
fear
,
but
the
set
of
canting
,
low
-
bred
hypocrites
who
are
wriggling
their
way
in
among
us
;
men
who
have
no
fixed
principle
,
no
standard
ideas
of
religion
or
doctrine
,
but
who
take
up
some
popular
cry
,
as
this
fellow
has
done
about
"
Sabbath
travelling
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Dr.
Grantly
did
not
again
repeat
the
question
aloud
,
but
he
did
so
constantly
to
himself
:
<EOS>
What
were
they
to
do
with
Mr.
Slope
?
<EOS>
How
was
he
openly
,
before
the
world
,
to
show
that
he
utterly
disapproved
of
and
abhorred
such
a
man
?
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
Barchester
had
escaped
the
taint
of
any
extreme
rigour
of
church
doctrine
.
<EOS>
The
clergymen
of
the
city
and
neighbourhood
,
though
very
well
inclined
to
promote
High
Church
principles
,
privileges
,
and
prerogatives
,
had
never
committed
themselves
to
tendencies
which
are
somewhat
too
loosely
called
Puseyite
practices
.
<EOS>
They
all
preached
in
their
black
gowns
,
as
their
fathers
had
done
before
them
;
they
wore
ordinary
black
cloth
waistcoats
;
they
had
no
candles
on
their
altars
,
either
lighted
or
unlighted
;
they
made
no
private
genuflexions
,
and
were
contented
to
confine
themselves
to
such
ceremonial
observances
as
had
been
in
vogue
for
the
last
hundred
years
.
<EOS>
The
services
were
decently
and
demurely
read
in
their
parish
churches
,
chanting
was
confined
to
the
cathedral
,
and
the
science
of
intoning
was
unknown
.
<EOS>
One
young
man
who
had
come
direct
from
Oxford
as
a
curate
to
Plumstead
had
,
after
the
lapse
of
two
or
three
Sundays
,
made
a
faint
attempt
,
much
to
the
bewilderment
of
the
poorer
part
of
the
congregation
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
had
not
been
present
on
the
occasion
,
but
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
,
who
had
her
own
opinion
on
the
subject
,
immediately
after
the
service
expressed
a
hope
that
the
young
gentleman
had
not
been
taken
ill
,
and
offered
to
send
him
all
kinds
of
condiments
supposed
to
be
good
for
a
sore
throat
.
<EOS>
After
that
there
had
been
no
more
intoning
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
the
archdeacon
began
to
meditate
on
some
strong
measures
of
absolute
opposition
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
and
his
crew
were
of
the
lowest
possible
order
of
Church
of
England
clergymen
,
and
therefore
it
behoved
him
,
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
,
to
be
of
the
very
highest
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
would
abolish
all
forms
and
ceremonies
,
and
therefore
Dr.
Grantly
felt
the
sudden
necessity
of
multiplying
them
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
would
consent
to
deprive
the
church
of
all
collective
authority
and
rule
,
and
therefore
Dr.
Grantly
would
stand
up
for
the
full
power
of
convocation
and
the
renewal
of
all
its
ancient
privileges
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
true
that
he
could
not
himself
intone
the
service
,
but
he
could
procure
the
co
-
operation
of
any
number
of
gentlemanlike
curates
well
trained
in
the
mystery
of
doing
so
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
willingly
alter
his
own
fashion
of
dress
,
but
he
could
people
Barchester
with
young
clergymen
dressed
in
the
longest
frocks
and
in
the
highest
-
breasted
silk
waistcoats
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
was
not
prepared
to
cross
himself
,
or
to
advocate
the
real
presence
,
but
without
going
this
length
there
were
various
observances
,
by
adopting
which
he
could
plainly
show
his
antipathy
to
such
men
as
Dr.
Proudie
and
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
All
these
things
passed
through
his
mind
as
he
paced
up
and
down
the
close
with
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
War
,
war
,
internecine
war
was
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
,
as
regarded
himself
and
Mr.
Slope
,
one
of
the
two
must
be
annihilated
as
far
as
the
city
of
Barchester
was
concerned
,
and
he
did
not
intend
to
give
way
until
there
was
not
left
to
him
an
inch
of
ground
on
which
he
could
stand
.
<EOS>
He
still
flattered
himself
that
he
could
make
Barchester
too
hot
to
hold
Mr.
Slope
,
and
he
had
no
weakness
of
spirit
to
prevent
his
bringing
about
such
a
consummation
if
it
were
in
his
power
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
Susan
must
call
at
the
palace
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
she
shall
call
there
,
but
it
shall
be
once
and
once
only
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
"
the
horses
"
wo
n't
find
it
convenient
to
come
out
to
Plumstead
very
soon
,
and
when
that
once
is
done
the
matter
may
drop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
Eleanor
need
call
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
Eleanor
would
get
on
at
all
well
with
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
the
least
necessity
in
life
,
"
replied
the
archdeacon
,
not
without
the
reflexion
that
a
ceremony
which
was
necessary
for
his
wife
might
not
be
at
all
binding
on
the
widow
of
John
Bold
.
"
<EOS>
Not
the
slightest
reason
on
earth
why
she
should
do
so
,
if
she
does
n't
like
it
.
<EOS>
For
myself
,
I
do
n't
think
that
any
decent
young
woman
should
be
subjected
to
the
nuisance
of
being
in
the
same
room
with
that
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
the
two
clergymen
parted
<EOS>
,
Mr.
Harding
going
to
his
daughter
's
house
,
and
the
archdeacon
seeking
the
seclusion
of
his
brougham
.
  
<EOS>
The
new
inhabitants
of
the
palace
did
not
express
any
higher
opinion
of
their
visitors
than
their
visitors
had
expressed
of
them
.
<EOS>
Though
they
did
not
use
quite
such
strong
language
as
Dr.
Grantly
had
done
,
they
felt
as
much
personal
aversion
,
and
were
quite
as
well
aware
as
he
was
that
there
would
be
a
battle
to
be
fought
,
and
that
there
was
hardly
room
for
Proudieism
in
Barchester
as
long
as
Grantlyism
was
predominant
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
may
be
doubted
whether
Mr.
Slope
had
not
already
within
his
breast
a
better
prepared
system
of
strategy
,
a
more
accurately
defined
line
of
hostile
conduct
than
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
was
going
to
fight
because
he
found
that
he
hated
the
man
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
predetermined
to
hate
the
man
because
he
foresaw
the
necessity
of
fighting
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
first
reviewed
the
_
carte
du
pays
_
previous
to
his
entry
into
Barchester
,
the
idea
had
occurred
to
him
of
conciliating
the
archdeacon
,
of
cajoling
and
flattering
him
into
submission
,
and
of
obtaining
the
upper
hand
by
cunning
instead
of
courage
.
<EOS>
A
little
inquiry
,
however
,
sufficed
to
convince
him
that
all
his
cunning
would
fail
to
win
over
such
a
man
as
Dr.
Grantly
to
such
a
mode
of
action
as
that
to
be
adopted
by
Mr.
Slope
,
and
then
he
determined
to
fall
back
upon
his
courage
.
<EOS>
He
at
once
saw
that
open
battle
against
Dr.
Grantly
and
<EOS>
all
Dr.
Grantly
's
adherents
was
a
necessity
of
his
position
,
and
he
deliberately
planned
the
most
expedient
methods
of
giving
offence
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
his
arrival
the
bishop
had
intimated
to
the
dean
that
,
with
the
permission
of
the
canon
then
in
residence
,
his
chaplain
would
preach
in
the
cathedral
on
the
next
Sunday
.
<EOS>
The
canon
in
residence
happened
to
be
the
Hon
.
<EOS>
and
Rev.
Dr.
Vesey
Stanhope
,
who
at
this
time
was
very
busy
on
the
shores
of
the
Lake
of
Como
,
adding
to
that
unique
collection
of
butterflies
for
which
he
is
so
famous
.
<EOS>
Or
rather
,
he
would
have
been
in
residence
but
for
the
butterflies
and
other
such
summer
-
day
considerations
;
and
the
vicar
-
choral
,
who
was
to
take
his
place
in
the
pulpit
,
by
no
means
objected
to
having
his
work
done
for
him
by
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
accordingly
preached
,
and
if
a
preacher
can
have
satisfaction
in
being
listened
to
,
Mr.
Slope
ought
to
have
been
gratified
.
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
think
that
he
was
gratified
,
and
that
he
left
the
pulpit
with
the
conviction
that
he
had
done
what
he
intended
to
do
when
he
entered
it
.
  
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
the
new
bishop
took
his
seat
for
the
first
time
in
the
throne
alloted
to
him
.
<EOS>
New
scarlet
cushions
and
drapery
had
been
prepared
,
with
new
gilt
binding
and
new
fringe
.
<EOS>
The
old
carved
oak
-
wood
of
the
throne
,
ascending
with
its
numerous
grotesque
pinnacles
half
-
way
up
to
the
roof
of
the
choir
,
had
been
washed
,
and
dusted
,
and
rubbed
,
and
it
all
looked
very
smart
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
how
often
sitting
there
,
in
happy
early
days
,
on
those
lowly
benches
in
front
of
the
altar
,
have
I
whiled
away
the
tedium
of
a
sermon
in
considering
how
best
I
might
thread
my
way
up
amidst
those
wooden
towers
and
climb
safely
to
the
topmost
pinnacle
!
  
<EOS>
All
Barchester
went
to
hear
Mr.
Slope
;
either
for
that
or
to
gaze
at
the
new
bishop
.
<EOS>
All
the
best
bonnets
of
the
city
were
there
,
and
moreover
all
the
best
glossy
clerical
hats
.
<EOS>
Not
a
stall
but
had
its
fitting
occupant
,
for
though
some
of
the
prebendaries
might
be
away
in
Italy
or
elsewhere
,
their
places
were
filled
by
brethren
who
flocked
into
Barchester
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
The
dean
was
there
,
a
heavy
old
man
,
now
too
old
,
indeed
,
to
attend
frequently
in
his
place
,
and
so
was
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
So
also
were
the
chancellor
,
the
treasurer
,
the
precentor
,
sundry
canons
and
minor
canons
,
and
every
lay
member
of
the
choir
,
prepared
to
sing
the
new
bishop
in
with
due
melody
and
harmonious
expression
of
sacred
welcome
.
  
<EOS>
The
service
was
certainly
very
well
performed
.
<EOS>
Such
was
always
the
case
at
Barchester
,
as
the
musical
education
of
the
choir
had
been
good
,
and
the
voices
had
been
carefully
selected
.
<EOS>
The
psalms
were
beautifully
chanted
;
the
Te
Deum
was
magnificently
sung
;
and
the
litany
was
given
in
a
manner
which
is
still
to
be
found
at
Barchester
,
but
,
if
my
taste
be
correct
,
is
to
be
found
nowhere
else
.
<EOS>
The
litany
in
Barchester
cathedral
has
long
been
the
special
task
to
which
Mr.
Harding
's
skill
and
voice
have
been
devoted
.
<EOS>
Crowded
audiences
generally
make
good
performers
,
and
though
Mr.
Harding
was
not
aware
of
any
extraordinary
exertion
on
his
part
,
yet
probably
he
rather
exceeded
his
usual
mark
.
<EOS>
Others
were
doing
their
best
,
and
it
was
natural
that
he
should
emulate
his
brethren
.
<EOS>
So
the
service
went
on
,
and
at
last
Mr.
Slope
got
into
the
pulpit
.
  
<EOS>
He
chose
for
his
text
a
verse
from
the
precepts
addressed
by
St.
Paul
to
Timothy
,
as
to
the
conduct
necessary
in
a
spiritual
pastor
and
guide
,
and
it
was
immediately
evident
that
the
good
clergy
of
Barchester
were
to
have
a
lesson
.
  
<EOS>
"
Study
to
show
thyself
approved
unto
God
,
a
workman
that
needeth
not
to
be
ashamed
,
rightly
dividing
the
word
of
truth
.
<EOS>
"
These
were
the
words
of
his
text
,
and
with
such
a
subject
in
such
a
place
,
it
may
be
supposed
that
such
a
preacher
would
be
listened
to
by
such
an
audience
.
<EOS>
He
was
listened
to
with
breathless
attention
and
not
without
considerable
surprise
.
<EOS>
Whatever
opinion
of
Mr.
Slope
might
have
been
held
in
Barchester
before
he
commenced
his
discourse
,
none
of
his
hearers
,
when
it
was
over
,
could
mistake
him
either
for
a
fool
or
a
coward
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
becoming
<EOS>
were
I
to
travesty
a
sermon
,
or
even
to
repeat
the
language
of
it
in
the
pages
of
a
novel
.
<EOS>
In
endeavouring
to
depict
the
characters
of
the
persons
of
whom
I
write
,
I
am
to
a
certain
extent
forced
to
speak
of
sacred
things
.
<EOS>
I
trust
,
however
,
that
I
shall
not
be
thought
to
scoff
at
the
pulpit
,
though
some
may
imagine
that
I
do
not
feel
all
the
reverence
that
is
due
to
the
cloth
.
<EOS>
I
may
question
the
infallibility
of
the
teachers
,
but
I
hope
that
I
shall
not
therefore
be
accused
of
doubt
as
to
the
thing
to
be
taught
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
in
commencing
his
sermon
,
showed
no
slight
tact
in
his
ambiguous
manner
of
hinting
that
,
humble
as
he
was
himself
,
he
stood
there
as
the
mouth
-
piece
of
the
illustrious
divine
who
sat
opposite
to
him
;
and
having
premised
so
much
,
he
gave
forth
a
very
accurate
definition
of
the
conduct
which
that
prelate
would
rejoice
to
see
in
the
clergymen
now
brought
under
his
jurisdiction
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
necessary
to
say
that
the
peculiar
points
insisted
upon
were
exactly
those
which
were
most
distasteful
to
the
clergy
of
the
diocese
,
and
most
averse
to
their
practice
and
opinions
,
and
that
all
those
peculiar
habits
and
privileges
which
have
always
been
dear
to
High
Church
priests
,
to
that
party
which
is
now
scandalously
called
the
"
high
and
dry
church
,
"
were
ridiculed
,
abused
,
and
anathematized
.
<EOS>
Now
,
the
clergymen
of
the
diocese
of
Barchester
are
all
of
the
high
and
dry
church
.
  
<EOS>
Having
thus
,
according
to
his
own
opinion
,
explained
how
a
clergyman
should
show
himself
approved
unto
God
,
as
a
workman
that
needeth
not
to
be
ashamed
,
he
went
on
to
explain
how
the
word
of
truth
should
be
divided
;
and
here
he
took
a
rather
narrow
view
of
the
question
and
fetched
his
arguments
from
afar
.
<EOS>
His
object
was
to
express
his
abomination
of
all
ceremonious
modes
of
utterance
,
to
cry
down
any
religious
feeling
which
might
be
excited
,
not
by
the
sense
,
but
by
the
sound
of
words
,
and
in
fact
to
insult
cathedral
practices
.
<EOS>
Had
St.
Paul
spoken
of
rightly
pronouncing
,
instead
of
rightly
dividing
the
word
of
truth
,
this
part
of
his
sermon
would
have
been
more
to
the
purpose
,
but
the
preacher
's
immediate
object
was
to
preach
Mr.
Slope
's
doctrine
,
and
not
St.
Paul
's
,
and
he
contrived
to
give
the
necessary
twist
to
the
text
with
some
skill
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
exactly
say
,
preaching
from
a
cathedral
pulpit
,
that
chanting
should
be
abandoned
in
cathedral
services
.
<EOS>
By
such
an
assertion
he
would
have
overshot
his
mark
and
rendered
himself
absurd
,
to
the
delight
of
his
hearers
.
<EOS>
He
could
,
however
,
and
did
,
allude
with
heavy
denunciations
to
the
practice
of
intoning
in
parish
churches
,
although
the
practice
was
all
but
unknown
in
the
diocese
;
and
from
thence
he
came
round
to
the
undue
preponderance
which
,
he
asserted
,
music
had
over
meaning
in
the
beautiful
service
which
they
had
just
heard
.
<EOS>
He
was
aware
,
he
said
,
that
the
practices
of
our
ancestors
could
not
be
abandoned
at
a
moment
's
notice
;
the
feelings
of
the
aged
would
be
outraged
,
and
the
minds
of
respectable
men
would
be
shocked
.
<EOS>
There
were
many
,
he
was
aware
,
of
not
sufficient
calibre
of
thought
to
perceive
,
of
not
sufficient
education
to
know
,
that
a
mode
of
service
which
was
effective
when
outward
ceremonies
were
of
more
moment
than
inward
feelings
,
had
become
all
but
barbarous
at
a
time
when
inward
conviction
was
everything
,
when
each
word
of
the
minister
's
lips
should
fall
intelligibly
into
the
listener
's
heart
.
<EOS>
Formerly
the
religion
of
the
multitude
had
been
an
affair
of
the
imagination
:
now
,
in
these
latter
days
,
it
had
become
necessary
that
a
Christian
should
have
a
reason
for
his
faith
 
should
not
only
believe
,
but
digest
 
not
only
hear
,
but
understand
.
<EOS>
The
words
of
our
morning
service
,
how
beautiful
,
how
apposite
,
how
intelligible
they
were
,
when
read
with
simple
and
distinct
decorum
!
<EOS>
But
how
much
of
the
meaning
of
the
words
was
lost
when
they
were
produced
with
all
the
meretricious
charms
of
melody
!

Here
was
a
sermon
to
be
preached
before
Mr.
Archdeacon
<EOS>
Grantly
,
Mr.
Precentor
Harding
,
and
the
rest
of
them
!
<EOS>
Before
a
whole
dean
and
chapter
assembled
in
their
own
cathedral
!
<EOS>
Before
men
who
had
grown
old
in
the
exercise
of
their
peculiar
services
,
with
a
full
conviction
of
their
excellence
for
all
intended
purposes
!
<EOS>
This
too
from
such
a
man
,
a
clerical
_
parvenu
_
,
a
man
without
a
cure
,
a
mere
chaplain
,
an
intruder
among
them
;
a
fellow
raked
up
,
so
said
Dr.
Grantly
,
from
the
gutters
of
Marylebone
!
<EOS>
They
had
to
sit
through
it
!
<EOS>
None
of
them
,
not
even
Dr.
Grantly
,
could
close
his
ears
,
nor
leave
the
house
of
God
during
the
hours
of
service
.
<EOS>
They
were
under
an
obligation
of
listening
,
and
that
too
without
any
immediate
power
of
reply
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
,
perhaps
,
no
greater
hardship
at
present
inflicted
on
mankind
in
civilized
and
free
countries
than
the
necessity
of
listening
to
sermons
.
<EOS>
No
one
but
a
preaching
clergyman
has
,
in
these
realms
,
the
power
of
compelling
an
audience
to
sit
silent
and
be
tormented
.
<EOS>
No
one
but
a
preaching
clergyman
can
revel
in
platitudes
,
truisms
,
and
untruisms
,
and
yet
receive
,
as
his
undisputed
privilege
,
the
same
respectful
demeanour
as
though
words
of
impassioned
eloquence
,
or
persuasive
logic
,
fell
from
his
lips
.
<EOS>
Let
a
professor
of
law
or
physics
find
his
place
in
a
lecture
-
room
,
and
there
pour
forth
jejune
words
and
useless
empty
phrases
,
and
he
will
pour
them
forth
to
empty
benches
.
<EOS>
Let
a
barrister
attempt
to
talk
without
talking
well
,
and
he
will
talk
but
seldom
.
<EOS>
A
judge
's
charge
need
be
listened
to
perforce
by
none
but
the
jury
,
prisoner
,
and
gaoler
.
<EOS>
A
member
of
Parliament
can
be
coughed
down
or
counted
out

<EOS>
Town
-
councillors
can
be
tabooed
.
<EOS>
But
no
one
can
rid
himself
of
the
preaching
clergyman
.
<EOS>
He
is
the
bore
of
the
age
,
the
old
man
whom
we
Sindbads
can
not
shake
off
,
the
nightmare
that
disturbs
our
Sunday
's
rest
,
the
incubus
that
overloads
our
religion
and
makes
God
's
service
distasteful
.
<EOS>
We
are
not
forced
into
church
!
<EOS>
No
:
<EOS>
but
we
desire
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
We
desire
not
to
be
forced
to
stay
away
.
<EOS>
We
desire
,
nay
,
we
are
resolute
,
to
enjoy
the
comfort
of
public
worship
,
but
we
desire
also
that
we
may
do
so
without
an
amount
of
tedium
which
ordinary
human
nature
can
not
endure
with
patience
;
that
we
may
be
able
to
leave
the
house
of
God
without
that
anxious
longing
for
escape
which
is
the
common
consequence
of
common
sermons
.
  
<EOS>
With
what
complacency
will
a
young
parson
deduce
false
conclusions
from
misunderstood
texts
,
and
then
threaten
us
with
all
the
penalties
of
Hades
if
we
neglect
to
comply
with
the
injunctions
he
has
given
us
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
too
self
-
confident
juvenile
friend
,
I
do
believe
in
those
mysteries
which
are
so
common
in
your
mouth
;
I
do
believe
in
the
unadulterated
word
which
you
hold
there
in
your
hand
;
but
you
must
pardon
me
if
,
in
some
things
,
I
doubt
your
interpretation
.
<EOS>
The
Bible
is
good
,
the
prayer
-
book
is
good
,
nay
,
you
yourself
would
be
acceptable
,
if
you
would
read
to
me
some
portion
of
those
time
-
honoured
discourses
which
our
great
divines
have
elaborated
in
the
full
maturity
of
their
powers
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
excuse
me
,
my
insufficient
young
lecturer
,
if
I
yawn
over
your
imperfect
sentences
,
your
repeated
phrases
,
your
false
pathos
,
your
drawlings
and
denouncings
,
your
humming
and
hawing
,
your
oh
-
ing
and
ah
-
ing
,
your
black
gloves
and
your
white
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
To
me
,
it
all
means
nothing
;
and
hours
are
too
precious
to
be
so
wasted
 
if
one
could
only
avoid
it
.
  
<EOS>
And
here
I
must
make
a
protest
against
the
pretence
,
so
often
put
forward
by
the
working
clergy
,
that
they
are
overburdened
by
the
multitude
of
sermons
to
be
preached
.
<EOS>
We
are
all
too
fond
of
our
own
voices
,
and
a
preacher
is
encouraged
in
the
vanity
of
making
his
heard
by
the
privilege
of
a
compelled
audience
.
<EOS>
His
sermon
is
the
pleasant
morsel
of
his
life
,
his
delicious
moment
of
self
-
exaltation
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
preached
nine
sermons
this
week
,
"
said
a
young
friend
to
me
the
other
day
,
with
hand
languidly
raised
to
his
brow
,
the
picture
of
an
overburdened
martyr
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nine
this
week
,
seven
last
week
,
four
the
week
before
.
<EOS>
I
have
preached
twenty
-
three
sermons
this
month
.
<EOS>
It
is
really
too
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Too
much
,
indeed
,
"
said
I
,
shuddering
;
"
too
much
for
the
strength
of
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
answered
meekly
,
"
indeed
it
is
;
I
am
beginning
to
feel
it
painfully
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
,
"
said
I
,
"
you
could
feel
it
 
would
that
you
could
be
made
to
feel
it
.
"
<EOS>
But
he
never
guessed
that
my
heart
was
wrung
for
the
poor
listeners
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
,
at
any
rate
,
no
tedium
felt
in
listening
to
Mr.
Slope
on
the
occasion
in
question
.
<EOS>
His
subject
came
too
home
to
his
audience
to
be
dull
,
and
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
Mr.
Slope
had
the
gift
of
using
words
forcibly
.
<EOS>
He
was
heard
through
his
thirty
minutes
of
eloquence
with
mute
attention
and
open
ears
,
but
with
angry
eyes
,
which
glared
round
from
one
enraged
parson
to
another
,
with
wide
-
spread
nostrils
from
which
already
burst
forth
fumes
of
indignation
,
and
with
many
shufflings
of
the
feet
and
uneasy
motions
of
the
body
,
which
betokened
minds
disturbed
,
and
hearts
not
at
peace
with
all
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
the
bishop
,
who
,
of
all
the
congregation
,
had
been
most
surprised
,
and
whose
hair
almost
stood
on
end
with
terror
,
gave
the
blessing
in
a
manner
not
at
all
equal
to
that
in
which
he
had
long
been
practising
it
in
his
own
study
,
and
the
congregation
was
free
to
go
their
way
.
   
<EOS>
The
Dean
and
Chapter
Take
Counsel
 
<EOS>
All
Barchester
was
in
a
tumult
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
could
hardly
get
himself
out
of
the
cathedral
porch
before
he
exploded
in
his
wrath
.
<EOS>
The
old
dean
betook
himself
silently
to
his
deanery
,
afraid
to
speak
,
and
there
sat
,
half
-
stupefied
,
pondering
many
things
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
crept
forth
solitary
and
unhappy
;
and
,
slowly
passing
beneath
the
elms
of
the
close
,
could
scarcely
bring
himself
to
believe
that
the
words
which
he
had
heard
had
proceeded
from
the
pulpit
of
Barchester
cathedral
.
<EOS>
Was
he
again
to
be
disturbed
?
<EOS>
Was
his
whole
life
to
be
shown
up
as
a
useless
sham
a
second
time
?
<EOS>
Would
he
have
to
abdicate
his
precentorship
,
as
he
had
his
wardenship
,
and
to
give
up
chanting
,
as
he
had
given
up
his
twelve
old
bedesmen
?
<EOS>
And
what
if
he
did
!
<EOS>
Some
other
Jupiter
,
some
other
Mr.
Slope
,
would
come
and
turn
him
out
of
St.
Cuthbert
's
.
<EOS>
Surely
he
could
not
have
been
wrong
all
his
life
in
chanting
the
litany
as
he
had
done
!
<EOS>
He
began
,
however
,
to
have
his
doubts
.
<EOS>
Doubting
himself
was
Mr.
Harding
's
weakness
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
,
however
,
the
usual
fault
of
his
order
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
All
Barchester
was
in
a
tumult
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
only
the
clergy
who
were
affected
.
<EOS>
The
laity
also
had
listened
to
Mr.
Slope
's
new
doctrine
,
all
with
surprise
,
some
with
indignation
,
and
some
with
a
mixed
feeling
,
in
which
dislike
of
the
preacher
was
not
so
strongly
blended
.
<EOS>
The
old
bishop
and
his
chaplains
,
the
dean
and
his
canons
and
minor
canons
,
the
old
choir
,
and
especially
Mr.
Harding
who
was
at
the
head
of
it
,
had
all
been
popular
in
Barchester
.
<EOS>
They
had
spent
their
money
and
done
good
;
the
poor
had
not
been
ground
down
;
the
clergy
in
society
had
neither
been
overbearing
nor
austere
;
and
the
whole
repute
of
the
city
was
due
to
its
ecclesiastical
importance
.
<EOS>
Yet
there
were
those
who
had
heard
Mr.
Slope
with
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
so
pleasant
to
receive
a
fillip
of
excitement
when
suffering
from
the
dull
routine
of
everyday
life
!
<EOS>
The
anthems
and
Te
Deums
were
in
themselves
delightful
,
but
they
had
been
heard
so
often
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
was
certainly
not
delightful
,
but
he
was
new
,
and
,
moreover
,
clever
.
<EOS>
They
had
long
thought
it
slow
,
so
said
now
many
of
the
Barchesterians
,
to
go
on
as
they
had
done
in
their
old
humdrum
way
,
giving
ear
to
none
of
the
religious
changes
which
were
moving
the
world
without
.
<EOS>
People
in
advance
of
the
age
now
had
new
ideas
,
and
it
was
quite
time
that
Barchester
should
go
in
advance
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
might
be
right
.
<EOS>
Sunday
had
certainly
not
been
strictly
kept
in
Barchester
,
except
as
regarded
the
cathedral
services
.
<EOS>
Indeed
the
two
hours
between
services
had
long
been
appropriated
to
morning
calls
and
hot
luncheons
.
<EOS>
Then
,
Sunday
-
schools
!
<EOS>
Really
more
ought
to
have
been
done
as
to
Sunday
-
schools
 
Sabbath
-
day
schools
Mr.
Slope
had
called
them
.
<EOS>
The
late
bishop
had
really
not
thought
of
Sunday
-
schools
as
he
should
have
done
.
<EOS>
(
These
people
probably
did
not
reflect
that
catechisms
and
collects
are
quite
as
hard
work
to
the
young
mind
as
bookkeeping
is
to
the
elderly
,
and
that
quite
as
little
feeling
of
worship
enters
into
the
one
task
as
the
other
.
)
<EOS>
And
then
,
as
regarded
that
great
question
of
musical
services
,
there
might
be
much
to
be
said
on
Mr.
Slope
's
side
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
It
certainly
was
the
fact
that
people
went
to
the
cathedral
to
hear
the
music
,
&
c.
&
c
  
<EOS>
And
so
a
party
absolutely
formed
itself
in
Barchester
on
Mr.
Slope
's
side
of
the
question
!
<EOS>
This
consisted
,
among
the
upper
classes
,
chiefly
of
ladies
.
<EOS>
No
man
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
no
gentleman
 
could
possibly
be
attracted
by
Mr.
Slope
,
or
consent
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
so
abhorrent
a
Gamaliel
.
<EOS>
Ladies
are
sometimes
less
nice
in
their
appreciation
of
physical
disqualification
;
provided
that
a
man
speak
to
them
well
,
they
will
listen
,
though
he
speak
from
a
mouth
never
so
deformed
and
hideous
.
<EOS>
Wilkes
was
most
fortunate
as
a
lover
,
and
the
damp
,
sandy
-
haired
,
saucer
-
eyed
,
red
-
fisted
Mr.
Slope
was
powerful
only
over
the
female
breast
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
,
however
,
one
or
two
of
the
neighbouring
clergy
who
thought
it
not
quite
safe
to
neglect
the
baskets
in
which
for
the
nonce
were
stored
the
loaves
and
fishes
of
the
diocese
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
They
,
and
they
only
,
came
to
call
on
Mr.
Slope
after
his
performance
in
the
cathedral
pulpit
.
<EOS>
Among
these
Mr.
Quiverful
,
the
rector
of
Puddingdale
,
whose
wife
still
continued
to
present
him
from
year
to
year
with
fresh
pledges
of
her
love
,
and
so
to
increase
his
cares
and
,
it
is
to
be
hoped
,
his
happiness
equally
.
<EOS>
Who
can
wonder
that
a
gentleman
with
fourteen
living
children
and
a
bare
income
of
£
400
a
year
should
look
after
the
loaves
and
fishes
,
even
when
they
are
under
the
thumb
of
a
Mr.
Slope
?
  
<EOS>
Very
soon
after
the
Sunday
on
which
the
sermon
was
preached
,
the
leading
clergy
of
the
neighbourhood
held
high
debate
together
as
to
how
Mr.
Slope
should
be
put
down
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
he
should
never
again
preach
from
the
pulpit
of
Barchester
cathedral
.
<EOS>
This
was
Dr.
Grantly
's
earliest
dictum
,
and
they
all
agreed
,
providing
only
that
they
had
the
power
to
exclude
him
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
declared
that
the
power
rested
with
the
dean
and
chapter
,
observing
that
no
clergyman
out
of
the
chapter
had
a
claim
to
preach
there
,
saving
only
the
bishop
himself
.
<EOS>
To
this
the
dean
assented
,
but
alleged
that
contests
on
such
a
subject
would
be
unseemly
;
to
which
rejoined
a
meagre
little
doctor
,
one
of
the
cathedral
prebendaries
,
that
the
contest
must
be
all
on
the
side
of
Mr.
Slope
if
every
prebendary
were
always
there
ready
to
take
his
own
place
in
the
pulpit
.
<EOS>
Cunning
little
meagre
doctor
,
whom
it
suits
well
to
live
in
his
own
cosy
house
within
Barchester
close
,
and
who
is
well
content
to
have
his
little
fling
at
Dr.
Vesey
Stanhope
and
other
absentees
,
whose
Italian
villas
,
or
enticing
London
homes
,
are
more
tempting
than
cathedral
stalls
and
residences
!
  
<EOS>
To
this
answered
the
burly
chancellor
,
a
man
rather
silent
indeed
,
but
very
sensible
,
that
absent
prebendaries
had
their
vicars
,
and
that
in
such
case
the
vicar
's
right
to
the
pulpit
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
higher
order
.
<EOS>
To
which
the
dean
assented
,
groaning
deeply
at
these
truths
.
<EOS>
Thereupon
,
however
,
the
meagre
doctor
remarked
that
they
would
be
in
the
hands
of
their
minor
canons
,
one
of
whom
might
at
any
hour
betray
his
trust
.
<EOS>
Whereon
was
heard
from
the
burly
chancellor
an
ejaculation
sounding
somewhat
like
"
Pooh
,
pooh
,
pooh
!
"
<EOS>
but
it
might
be
that
the
worthy
man
was
but
blowing
out
the
heavy
breath
from
his
windpipe
.
<EOS>
Why
silence
him
at
all
?
<EOS>
suggested
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
Let
them
not
be
ashamed
to
hear
what
any
man
might
have
to
preach
to
them
,
unless
he
preached
false
doctrine
;
in
which
case
,
let
the
bishop
silence
him
.
<EOS>
So
spoke
our
friend
;
vainly
;
for
human
ends
must
be
attained
by
human
means
.
<EOS>
But
the
dean
saw
a
ray
of
hope
out
of
those
purblind
old
eyes
of
his
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
let
them
tell
the
bishop
how
distasteful
to
them
was
this
Mr.
Slope
:
<EOS>
a
new
bishop
just
come
to
his
seat
could
not
wish
to
insult
his
clergy
while
the
gloss
was
yet
fresh
on
his
first
apron
.
  
<EOS>
Then
up
rose
Dr.
Grantly
and
,
having
thus
collected
the
scattered
wisdom
of
his
associates
,
spoke
forth
with
words
of
deep
authority
.
<EOS>
When
I
say
up
rose
the
archdeacon
,
I
speak
of
the
inner
man
,
which
then
sprang
up
to
more
immediate
action
,
for
the
doctor
had
bodily
been
standing
all
along
with
his
back
to
the
dean
's
empty
fire
-
grate
,
and
the
tails
of
his
frock
coat
supported
over
his
two
arms
.
<EOS>
His
hands
were
in
his
breeches
pockets
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
quite
clear
that
this
man
must
not
be
allowed
to
preach
again
in
this
cathedral
.
<EOS>
We
all
see
that
,
except
our
dear
friend
here
,
the
milk
of
whose
nature
runs
so
softly
that
he
would
not
have
the
heart
to
refuse
the
Pope
<EOS>
the
loan
of
his
pulpit
,
if
the
Pope
would
come
and
ask
it
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
,
however
,
allow
the
man
to
preach
again
here
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
because
his
opinion
on
church
matters
may
be
different
from
ours
 
with
that
one
would
not
quarrel
.
<EOS>
It
is
because
he
has
purposely
insulted
us
.
<EOS>
When
he
went
up
into
that
pulpit
last
Sunday
,
his
studied
object
was
to
give
offence
to
men
who
had
grown
old
in
reverence
of
those
things
of
which
he
dared
to
speak
so
slightingly
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
To
come
here
a
stranger
,
a
young
,
unknown
,
and
unfriended
stranger
,
and
tell
us
,
in
the
name
of
the
bishop
his
master
,
that
we
are
ignorant
of
our
duties
,
old
-
fashioned
,
and
useless
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
most
to
admire
his
courage
or
his
impudence
!
<EOS>
And
one
thing
I
will
tell
you
:
that
sermon
originated
solely
with
the
man
himself
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
was
no
more
a
party
to
it
than
was
the
dean
here
.
<EOS>
You
all
know
how
grieved
I
am
to
see
a
bishop
in
this
diocese
holding
the
latitudinarian
ideas
by
which
Dr.
Proudie
has
made
himself
conspicuous
.
<EOS>
You
all
know
how
greatly
I
should
distrust
the
opinion
of
such
a
man
.
<EOS>
But
in
this
matter
I
hold
him
to
be
blameless
.
<EOS>
I
believe
Dr.
Proudie
has
lived
too
long
among
gentlemen
to
be
guilty
,
or
to
instigate
another
to
be
guilty
,
of
so
gross
an
outrage
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
That
man
uttered
what
was
untrue
when
he
hinted
that
he
was
speaking
as
the
mouthpiece
of
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
It
suited
his
ambitious
views
at
once
to
throw
down
the
gauntlet
to
us
 
at
once
to
defy
us
here
in
the
quiet
of
our
own
religious
duties
 
here
within
the
walls
of
our
own
loved
cathedral
 
here
where
we
have
for
so
many
years
exercised
our
ministry
without
schism
and
with
good
repute
.
<EOS>
Such
an
attack
upon
us
,
coming
from
such
a
quarter
,
is
abominable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Abominable
,
"
groaned
the
dean
.
"
<EOS>
Abominable
,
"
muttered
the
meagre
doctor
.
"
<EOS>
Abominable
,
"
re
-
echoed
the
chancellor
,
uttering
the
sound
from
the
bottom
of
his
deep
chest
.
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
it
was
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
Most
abominable
and
most
unjustifiable
,
"
continued
the
archdeacon
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
Mr.
Dean
,
thank
God
,
that
pulpit
is
still
our
own
:
<EOS>
your
own
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
That
pulpit
belongs
solely
to
the
dean
and
chapter
of
Barchester
Cathedral
,
and
as
yet
Mr.
Slope
is
no
part
of
that
chapter
.
<EOS>
You
,
Mr.
Dean
,
have
suggested
that
we
should
appeal
to
the
bishop
to
abstain
from
forcing
this
man
on
us
;
but
what
if
the
bishop
allow
himself
to
be
ruled
by
his
chaplain
?
<EOS>
In
my
opinion
the
matter
is
in
our
own
hands
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
can
not
preach
there
without
permission
asked
and
obtained
,
and
let
that
permission
be
invariably
refused
.
<EOS>
Let
all
participation
in
the
ministry
of
the
cathedral
service
be
refused
to
him
.
<EOS>
Then
,
if
the
bishop
choose
to
interfere
,
we
shall
know
what
answer
to
make
to
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
My
friend
here
has
suggested
that
this
man
may
again
find
his
way
into
the
pulpit
by
undertaking
the
duty
of
some
of
your
minor
canons
,
but
I
am
sure
that
we
may
fully
trust
to
these
gentlemen
to
support
us
,
when
it
is
known
that
the
dean
objects
to
any
such
transfer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
may
,
"
said
the
chancellor
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
much
more
discussion
among
the
learned
conclave
,
all
of
which
,
of
course
,
ended
in
obedience
to
the
archdeacon
's
commands
.
<EOS>
They
had
too
long
been
accustomed
to
his
rule
to
shake
it
off
so
soon
,
and
in
this
particular
case
they
had
none
of
them
a
wish
to
abet
the
man
whom
he
was
so
anxious
to
put
down
.
  
<EOS>
Such
a
meeting
as
that
we
have
just
recorded
is
not
held
in
such
a
city
as
Barchester
unknown
and
untold
of
.
<EOS>
Not
only
was
the
fact
of
the
meeting
talked
of
in
every
respectable
house
,
including
the
palace
,
but
the
very
speeches
of
the
dean
,
the
archdeacon
,
and
chancellor
were
repeated
;
not
without
many
additions
and
imaginary
circumstances
,
according
to
the
tastes
and
opinions
of
the
relaters
.
  
<EOS>
All
,
however
,
agreed
in
saying
that
Mr.
Slope
was
to
be
debarred
from
opening
his
mouth
in
the
cathedral
of
Barchester
;
many
believed
that
the
vergers
were
to
be
ordered
to
refuse
him
even
the
accommodation
of
a
seat
;
and
some
of
the
most
far
-
going
advocates
for
strong
measures
declared
that
his
sermon
was
looked
upon
as
an
indictable
offence
,
and
that
proceedings
were
to
be
taken
against
him
for
brawling
.
  
<EOS>
The
party
who
were
inclined
to
defend
him
 
the
enthusiastically
religious
young
ladies
and
the
middle
-
aged
spinsters
desirous
of
a
move
 
<EOS>
of
course
took
up
his
defence
the
more
warmly
on
account
of
this
attack
.
<EOS>
If
they
could
not
hear
Mr.
Slope
in
the
cathedral
,
they
would
hear
him
elsewhere
;
they
would
leave
the
dull
dean
,
the
dull
old
prebendaries
,
and
the
scarcely
less
dull
young
minor
canons
to
preach
to
each
other
;
they
would
work
slippers
and
cushions
and
hem
bands
for
Mr.
Slope
,
make
him
a
happy
martyr
,
and
stick
him
up
in
some
new
Sion
or
Bethesda
,
and
put
the
cathedral
quite
out
of
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Proudie
at
once
returned
to
London
.
<EOS>
They
thought
it
expedient
not
to
have
to
encounter
any
personal
application
from
the
dean
and
chapter
respecting
the
sermon
till
the
violence
of
the
storm
had
expended
itself
;
but
they
left
Mr.
Slope
behind
them
nothing
daunted
,
and
he
went
about
his
work
zealously
,
flattering
such
as
would
listen
to
his
flattery
,
whispering
religious
twaddle
into
the
ears
of
foolish
women
,
ingratiating
himself
with
the
few
clergy
who
would
receive
him
,
visiting
the
houses
of
the
poor
,
inquiring
into
all
people
,
prying
into
everything
,
and
searching
with
his
minutest
eye
into
all
palatial
dilapidations
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
,
however
,
make
any
immediate
attempt
to
preach
again
in
the
cathedral
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
all
Barchester
was
by
the
ears
.

The
Ex

warden
Rejoices
in
His
Probable
Return
to
the
Hospital
 
<EOS>
Among
the
ladies
in
Barchester
who
have
hitherto
acknowledged
Mr.
Slope
as
their
spiritual
director
must
not
be
reckoned
either
the
Widow
Bold
or
her
sister
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
On
the
first
outbreak
of
the
wrath
of
the
denizens
of
the
close
,
none
had
been
more
animated
against
the
intruder
than
these
two
ladies
.
<EOS>
And
this
was
natural
.
<EOS>
Who
could
be
so
proud
of
the
musical
distinction
of
their
own
cathedral
as
the
favourite
daughter
of
the
precentor
?
<EOS>
Who
would
be
so
likely
to
resent
an
insult
offered
to
the
old
choir
?
<EOS>
And
in
such
matters
Miss
Bold
and
her
sister
-
in
-
law
had
but
one
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
This
wrath
,
however
,
has
in
some
degree
been
mitigated
,
and
I
regret
to
say
that
these
ladies
allowed
Mr.
Slope
to
be
his
own
apologist
.
<EOS>
About
a
fortnight
after
the
sermon
had
been
preached
,
they
were
both
of
them
not
a
little
surprised
by
hearing
Mr.
Slope
announced
,
as
the
page
in
buttons
opened
Mrs.
Bold
's
drawing
-
room
door
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
what
living
man
could
,
by
a
mere
morning
visit
,
have
surprised
them
more
?
<EOS>
Here
was
the
great
enemy
of
all
that
was
good
in
Barchester
coming
into
their
own
drawing
-
room
,
and
they
had
no
strong
arm
,
no
ready
tongue
,
near
at
hand
for
their
protection
.
<EOS>
The
widow
snatched
her
baby
out
of
its
cradle
into
her
lap
,
and
Mary
Bold
stood
up
ready
to
die
manfully
in
that
baby
's
behalf
,
should
,
under
any
circumstances
,
such
a
sacrifice
become
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
manner
was
Mr.
Slope
received
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
left
,
he
was
allowed
by
each
lady
to
take
her
hand
and
to
make
his
adieux
as
gentlemen
do
who
have
been
graciously
entertained
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
he
shook
hands
with
them
,
and
was
curtseyed
out
courteously
,
the
buttoned
page
opening
the
door
as
he
would
have
done
for
the
best
canon
of
them
all
.
<EOS>
He
had
touched
the
baby
's
little
hand
and
blessed
him
with
a
fervid
blessing
;
he
had
spoken
to
the
widow
of
her
early
sorrows
,
and
Eleanor
's
silent
tears
had
not
rebuked
him
;
he
had
told
Mary
Bold
that
her
devotion
would
be
rewarded
,
and
Mary
Bold
had
heard
the
praise
without
disgust
.
<EOS>
And
how
had
he
done
all
this
?
<EOS>
How
had
he
so
quickly
turned
aversion
into
,
at
any
rate
,
acquaintance
?
<EOS>
How
had
he
over
-
come
the
enmity
with
which
these
ladies
had
been
ready
to
receive
him
,
and
made
his
peace
with
them
so
easily
?
  
<EOS>
My
readers
will
guess
from
what
I
have
written
that
I
myself
do
not
like
Mr.
Slope
,
but
I
am
constrained
to
admit
that
he
is
a
man
of
parts
.
<EOS>
He
knows
how
to
say
a
soft
word
in
the
proper
place
;
he
knows
how
to
adapt
his
flattery
to
the
ears
of
his
hearers
;
he
knows
the
wiles
of
the
serpent
,
and
he
uses
them
.
<EOS>
Could
Mr.
Slope
have
adapted
his
manners
to
men
as
well
as
to
women
,
could
he
ever
have
learnt
the
ways
of
a
gentleman
,
he
might
have
risen
to
great
things
.
  
<EOS>
He
commenced
his
acquaintance
with
Eleanor
by
praising
her
father
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
he
said
,
become
aware
that
he
had
unfortunately
offended
the
feelings
of
a
man
of
whom
he
could
not
speak
too
highly
;
he
would
not
now
allude
to
a
subject
which
was
probably
too
serious
for
drawing
-
room
conversation
,
but
he
would
say
that
it
had
been
very
far
from
him
to
utter
a
word
in
disparagement
of
a
man
of
whom
<EOS>
all
the
world
,
at
least
the
clerical
world
,
spoke
so
highly
as
it
did
of
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
And
so
he
went
on
,
unsaying
a
great
deal
of
his
sermon
,
expressing
his
highest
admiration
for
the
precentor
's
musical
talents
,
eulogizing
the
father
and
the
daughter
and
the
sister
-
in
-
law
,
speaking
in
that
low
silky
whisper
which
he
always
had
specially
prepared
for
feminine
ears
,
and
,
ultimately
,
gaining
his
object
.
<EOS>
When
he
left
,
he
expressed
a
hope
that
he
might
again
be
allowed
to
call
;
and
though
Eleanor
gave
no
verbal
assent
to
this
,
she
did
not
express
dissent
:
and
so
Mr.
Slope
's
right
to
visit
at
the
widow
's
house
was
established
.
  
<EOS>
The
day
after
this
visit
Eleanor
told
her
father
of
it
and
expressed
an
opinion
that
Mr.
Slope
was
not
quite
so
black
as
he
had
been
painted
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
opened
his
eyes
rather
wider
than
usual
when
he
heard
what
had
occurred
,
but
he
said
little
;
he
could
not
agree
in
any
praise
of
Mr.
Slope
,
and
it
was
not
his
practice
to
say
much
evil
of
anyone
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
,
however
,
like
the
visit
,
and
simple
-
minded
as
he
was
,
he
felt
sure
that
Mr.
Slope
had
some
deeper
motive
than
the
mere
pleasure
of
making
soft
speeches
to
two
ladies
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
,
however
,
had
come
to
see
his
daughter
with
other
purpose
than
that
of
speaking
either
good
or
evil
of
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
to
tell
her
that
the
place
of
warden
in
Hiram
's
Hospital
was
again
to
be
filled
up
,
and
that
in
all
probability
he
would
once
more
return
to
his
old
home
and
his
twelve
bedesmen
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
said
he
,
laughing
,
"
I
shall
be
greatly
shorn
of
my
ancient
glory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
so
,
Papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
new
act
of
Parliament
that
is
to
put
us
all
on
our
feet
again
,
"
continued
he
,
"
settles
my
income
at
four
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
per
annum
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Four
hundred
and
fifty
,
"
said
she
,
"
instead
of
eight
hundred
!
<EOS>
Well
,
that
is
rather
shabby
.
<EOS>
But
still
,
Papa
,
you
'll
have
the
dear
old
house
and
the
garden
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
he
,
"
it
's
worth
twice
the
money
;
"
and
as
he
spoke
he
showed
a
jaunty
kind
of
satisfaction
in
his
tone
and
manner
and
in
the
quick
,
pleasant
way
in
which
he
paced
Eleanor
's
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
worth
twice
the
money
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
the
house
and
the
garden
and
a
larger
income
than
I
can
possibly
want
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
you
'll
have
no
extravagant
daughter
to
provide
for
;
"
and
as
she
spoke
,
the
young
widow
put
her
arm
within
his
,
and
made
him
sit
on
the
sofa
beside
her
;
"
at
any
rate
,
you
'll
not
have
that
expense
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
,
and
I
shall
be
rather
lonely
without
her
;
but
we
wo
n't
think
of
that
now
.
<EOS>
As
regards
income
,
I
shall
have
plenty
for
all
I
want
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
my
old
house
,
and
I
do
n't
mind
owning
now
that
I
have
felt
sometimes
the
inconvenience
of
living
in
a
lodging
.
<EOS>
Lodgings
are
very
nice
for
young
men
,
but
at
my
time
of
life
there
is
a
want
of
 
I
hardly
know
what
to
call
it
,
perhaps
not
respectability
 
"
  
"
Oh
,
Papa
!
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
there
's
been
nothing
like
that
.
<EOS>
Nobody
has
thought
it
;
nobody
in
all
Barchester
has
been
more
respected
than
you
have
been
since
you
took
those
rooms
in
High
Street
.
<EOS>
Nobody
!
<EOS>
Not
the
dean
in
his
deanery
,
or
the
archdeacon
out
at
Plumstead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
archdeacon
would
not
be
much
obliged
to
you
if
he
heard
you
,
"
said
he
,
smiling
somewhat
at
the
exclusive
manner
in
which
his
daughter
confined
her
illustration
to
the
church
dignitaries
of
the
chapter
of
Barchester
;
"
but
at
any
rate
I
shall
be
glad
to
get
back
to
the
old
house
.
<EOS>
Since
I
heard
that
it
was
all
settled
,
I
have
begun
to
fancy
that
I
ca
n't
be
comfortable
without
my
two
sitting
-
rooms
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
and
stay
with
me
,
Papa
,
till
it
is
settled
 
<EOS>
there
's
a
dear
Papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
ye
,
Nelly
.
<EOS>
But
no
,
I
wo
n't
do
that
.
<EOS>
It
would
make
two
movings
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
get
back
to
my
old
men
again
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
There
have
six
of
them
gone
in
these
few
last
years
.
<EOS>
Six
out
of
twelve
!
<EOS>
And
the
others
I
fear
have
had
but
a
sorry
life
of
it
there
.
<EOS>
Poor
Bunce
,
poor
old
Bunce
!
"
  
<EOS>
Bunce
was
one
of
the
surviving
recipients
of
Hiram
's
charity
,
an
old
man
,
now
over
ninety
,
who
had
long
been
a
favourite
of
Mr.
Harding
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
happy
old
Bunce
will
be
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bold
,
clapping
her
soft
hands
softly
.
<EOS>
"
How
happy
they
all
will
be
to
have
you
back
again
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
there
will
soon
be
friendship
among
them
again
when
you
are
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
said
he
,
half
-
laughing
,
"
I
am
to
have
new
troubles
,
which
will
be
terrible
to
me
.
<EOS>
There
are
to
be
twelve
old
women
,
and
a
matron
.
<EOS>
How
shall
I
manage
twelve
women
and
a
matron
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
matron
will
manage
the
women
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
'll
manage
the
matron
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
wo
n't
want
to
be
managed
.
<EOS>
She
'll
be
a
great
lady
herself
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
But
,
Papa
,
where
will
the
matron
live
?
<EOS>
She
is
not
to
live
in
the
warden
's
house
with
you
,
is
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
hope
not
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Papa
,
I
tell
you
fairly
,
I
wo
n't
have
a
matron
for
a
new
stepmother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
sha
n't
,
my
dear
;
that
is
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
But
they
are
going
to
build
another
house
for
the
matron
and
the
women
,
and
I
believe
they
have
n't
even
fixed
yet
on
the
site
of
the
building
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
have
they
appointed
the
matron
?
"
said
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
n't
appointed
the
warden
yet
,
"
replied
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
's
no
doubt
about
that
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
his
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
explained
that
he
thought
there
was
no
doubt
;
that
the
archdeacon
had
declared
as
much
,
saying
that
the
bishop
and
his
chaplain
between
them
had
not
the
power
to
appoint
anyone
else
,
even
if
they
had
the
will
to
do
so
,
and
sufficient
impudence
to
carry
out
such
a
will
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
was
of
opinion
that
,
though
Mr.
Harding
had
resigned
his
wardenship
,
and
had
done
so
unconditionally
,
he
had
done
so
under
circumstances
which
left
the
bishop
no
choice
as
to
his
reappointment
,
now
that
the
affair
of
the
hospital
had
been
settled
on
a
new
basis
by
act
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
archdeacon
's
opinion
,
and
his
father
-
in
-
law
received
it
without
a
shadow
of
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
had
always
been
strongly
opposed
to
Mr.
Harding
's
resignation
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
He
had
done
all
in
his
power
to
dissuade
him
from
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
considered
that
Mr.
Harding
was
bound
to
withstand
the
popular
clamour
with
which
he
was
attacked
for
receiving
so
large
an
income
as
eight
hundred
a
year
from
such
a
charity
,
and
was
not
even
yet
satisfied
that
his
father
-
in
-
law
's
conduct
had
not
been
pusillanimous
and
undignified
.
<EOS>
He
looked
also
on
this
reduction
of
the
warden
's
income
as
a
shabby
,
paltry
scheme
on
the
part
of
government
for
escaping
from
a
difficulty
into
which
it
had
been
brought
by
the
public
press
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
observed
that
the
government
had
no
more
right
to
dispose
of
a
sum
of
four
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
out
of
the
income
of
Hiram
's
legacy
than
of
nine
hundred
;
whereas
,
as
he
said
,
the
bishop
,
dean
,
and
chapter
clearly
had
a
right
to
settle
what
sum
should
be
paid
.
<EOS>
He
also
declared
that
the
government
had
no
more
right
to
saddle
the
charity
with
twelve
old
women
than
with
twelve
hundred
;
and
he
was
,
therefore
,
very
indignant
on
the
matter
.
<EOS>
He
probably
forgot
when
so
talking
that
government
had
done
nothing
of
the
kind
,
and
had
never
assumed
any
such
might
or
any
such
right
.
<EOS>
He
made
the
common
mistake
of
attributing
to
the
government
,
which
in
such
matters
is
powerless
,
the
doings
of
Parliament
,
which
in
such
matters
is
omnipotent
.
  
<EOS>
But
though
he
felt
that
the
glory
and
honour
of
the
situation
of
warden
of
Barchester
Hospital
were
indeed
curtailed
by
the
new
arrangement
;
that
the
whole
establishment
had
to
a
certain
degree
been
made
vile
by
the
touch
of
Whig
commissioners
;
that
the
place
,
with
its
lessened
income
,
its
old
women
,
and
other
innovations
,
was
very
different
from
the
hospital
of
former
days
;
still
the
archdeacon
was
too
practical
a
man
of
the
world
to
wish
that
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
who
had
at
present
little
more
than
£
200
per
annum
for
all
his
wants
,
should
refuse
the
situation
,
defiled
,
undignified
,
and
commission
-
ridden
as
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
had
,
accordingly
,
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
return
to
his
old
home
at
the
hospital
,
and
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
had
experienced
almost
a
childish
pleasure
in
the
idea
of
doing
so
.
<EOS>
The
diminished
income
was
to
him
not
even
the
source
of
momentary
regret
.
<EOS>
The
matron
and
the
old
women
did
rather
go
against
the
grain
,
but
he
was
able
to
console
himself
with
the
reflection
that
,
after
all
,
such
an
arrangement
might
be
of
real
service
to
the
poor
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
The
thought
that
he
must
receive
his
reappointment
as
the
gift
of
the
new
bishop
,
and
probably
through
the
hands
of
Mr.
Slope
,
annoyed
him
a
little
,
but
his
mind
was
set
at
rest
by
the
assurance
of
the
archdeacon
that
there
would
be
no
favour
in
such
a
presentation
.
<EOS>
The
reappointment
of
the
old
warden
would
be
regarded
by
all
the
world
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
,
therefore
,
felt
no
hesitation
in
telling
his
daughter
that
they
might
look
upon
his
return
to
his
old
quarters
as
a
settled
matter
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
wo
n't
have
to
ask
for
it
,
Papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
ground
on
which
I
could
ask
for
any
favour
from
the
bishop
,
whom
,
indeed
,
I
hardly
know
.
<EOS>
Nor
would
I
ask
a
favour
,
the
granting
of
which
might
possibly
be
made
a
question
to
be
settled
by
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
No
,
"
said
he
,
moved
for
a
moment
by
a
spirit
very
unlike
his
own
,
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
shall
be
very
glad
to
go
back
to
the
hospital
;
but
I
should
never
go
there
if
it
were
necessary
that
my
doing
so
should
be
the
subject
of
a
request
to
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
little
outbreak
of
her
father
's
anger
jarred
on
the
present
tone
of
Eleanor
's
mind
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
learnt
to
like
Mr.
Slope
,
but
she
had
learnt
to
think
that
he
had
much
respect
for
her
father
;
and
she
would
,
therefore
,
willingly
use
her
efforts
to
induce
something
like
good
feeling
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
think
you
somewhat
mistake
Mr.
Slope
's
character
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
?
"
said
he
placidly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
do
,
Papa
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
intended
no
personal
disrespect
to
you
when
he
preached
the
sermon
which
made
the
archdeacon
and
the
dean
so
angry
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
supposed
he
did
,
<EOS>
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
never
inquired
within
myself
whether
he
did
or
no
.
<EOS>
Such
a
matter
would
be
unworthy
of
any
inquiry
,
and
very
unworthy
of
the
consideration
of
the
chapter
.
<EOS>
But
I
fear
he
intended
disrespect
to
the
ministration

might
it

Believe
me

my

that
Christian
ministers
are
never
called
on

God
's
word

insult
the

I
am

,
put
on

us
walk
round
the

Eleanor
rang
the
bell
and
gave
a
variety
of
imperative
charges
as
to
the
welfare
of
the
precious
baby
,
whom
,
all
but
unwillingly
,
she
was
about
to
leave
for
an
hour
or
so
,
and
then
sauntered
forth
with
her
father
to
revisit
the
old
hospital
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
forbidden
ground
to
her
as
well
as
to
him
since
the
day
on
which
they
had
walked
forth
together
from
its
walls
.
   
<EOS>
The
Stanhope
Family
 
<EOS>
It
is
now
three
months
since
Dr.
Proudie
began
his
reign
,
and
changes
have
already
been
effected
in
the
diocese
which
show
at
least
the
energy
of
an
active
mind
.
<EOS>
Among
other
things
absentee
clergymen
have
been
favoured
with
hints
much
too
strong
to
be
overlooked
.
<EOS>
Poor
dear
old
Bishop
<EOS>
Grantly
had
on
this
matter
been
too
lenient
,
and
the
archdeacon
had
never
been
inclined
to
be
severe
with
those
who
were
absent
on
reputable
pretences
,
and
who
provided
for
their
duties
in
a
liberal
way
.
  
<EOS>
Among
the
greatest
of
the
diocesan
sinners
in
this
respect
was
Dr.
Vesey
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
Years
had
now
passed
since
he
had
done
a
day
's
duty
,
and
yet
there
was
no
reason
against
his
doing
duty
except
a
want
of
inclination
on
his
own
part
.
<EOS>
He
held
a
prebendal
stall
in
the
diocese
,
one
of
the
best
residences
in
the
close
,
and
the
two
large
rectories
of
Crabtree
Canonicorum
and
Stogpingum
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
had
the
cure
of
three
parishes
,
for
that
of
Eiderdown
was
joined
to
Stogpingum
.
<EOS>
He
had
resided
in
Italy
for
twelve
years
.
<EOS>
His
first
going
there
had
been
attributed
to
a
sore
throat
,
and
that
sore
throat
,
though
never
repeated
in
any
violent
manner
,
had
stood
him
in
such
stead
that
it
had
enabled
him
to
live
in
easy
idleness
ever
since
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
now
been
summoned
home
 
not
,
indeed
,
with
rough
violence
,
or
by
any
peremptory
command
,
but
by
a
mandate
which
he
found
himself
unable
to
disregard
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
written
to
him
by
the
bishop
's
desire
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
the
bishop
much
wanted
the
valuable
co
-
operation
of
Dr.
Vesey
Stanhope
in
the
diocese
;
in
the
next
,
the
bishop
thought
it
his
imperative
duty
to
become
personally
acquainted
with
the
most
conspicuous
of
his
diocesan
clergy
;
then
the
bishop
thought
it
essentially
necessary
for
Dr.
Stanhope
's
own
interests
that
Dr.
Stanhope
should
,
at
any
rate
for
a
time
,
return
to
Barchester
;
and
lastly
,
it
was
said
that
so
strong
a
feeling
was
at
the
present
moment
evinced
by
the
hierarchs
of
the
church
with
reference
to
the
absence
of
its
clerical
members
,
that
it
behoved
Dr.
Vesey
Stanhope
not
to
allow
his
name
to
stand
among
those
which
would
probably
in
a
few
months
be
submitted
to
the
councils
of
the
nation
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
ambiguously
frightful
in
this
last
threat
that
Dr.
Stanhope
determined
to
spend
two
or
three
summer
months
at
his
residence
in
Barchester
.
<EOS>
His
rectories
were
inhabited
by
his
curates
,
and
he
felt
himself
from
disuse
to
be
unfit
for
parochial
duty
;
but
his
prebendal
home
was
kept
empty
for
him
,
and
he
thought
it
probable
that
he
might
be
able
now
and
again
to
preach
a
prebendal
sermon
.
<EOS>
He
arrived
,
therefore
,
with
all
his
family
at
Barchester
,
and
he
and
they
must
be
introduced
to
my
readers
.
  
<EOS>
The
great
family
characteristic
of
the
Stanhopes
might
probably
be
said
to
be
heartlessness
,
but
this
want
of
feeling
was
,
in
most
of
them
,
accompanied
by
so
great
an
amount
of
good
nature
as
to
make
itself
but
little
noticeable
to
the
world
.
<EOS>
They
were
so
prone
to
oblige
their
neighbours
that
their
neighbours
failed
to
perceive
how
indifferent
to
them
was
the
happiness
and
well
-
being
of
those
around
them
.
<EOS>
The
Stanhopes
would
visit
you
in
your
sickness
(
provided
it
were
not
contagious
)
,
would
bring
you
oranges
,
French
novels
,
and
the
last
new
bit
of
scandal
,
and
then
hear
of
your
death
or
your
recovery
with
an
equally
indifferent
composure
.
<EOS>
Their
conduct
to
each
other
was
the
same
as
to
the
world
;
they
bore
and
forbore
;
and
there
was
sometimes
,
as
will
be
seen
,
much
necessity
for
forbearing
;
but
their
love
among
themselves
rarely
reached
above
this
.
<EOS>
It
is
astonishing
how
much
each
of
the
family
was
able
to
do
,
and
how
much
each
did
,
to
prevent
the
well
-
being
of
the
other
four
.
  
<EOS>
For
there
were
five
in
all
;
the
doctor
,
namely
,
and
Mrs.
Stanhope
,
two
daughters
,
and
one
son
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
,
perhaps
,
was
the
least
singular
and
most
estimable
of
them
all
,
and
yet
such
good
qualities
as
he
possessed
were
all
negative
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
good
-
looking
rather
plethoric
gentleman
of
about
sixty
years
of
age
.
<EOS>
His
hair
was
snow
-
white
,
very
plentiful
,
and
somewhat
like
wool
of
the
finest
description
.
<EOS>
His
whiskers
were
very
large
and
very
white
,
and
gave
to
his
face
the
appearance
of
a
benevolent
,
sleepy
old
lion
.
<EOS>
His
dress
was
always
unexceptionable
.
<EOS>
Although
he
had
lived
so
many
years
in
Italy
it
was
invariably
of
a
decent
clerical
hue
,
but
it
never
was
hyperclerical
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
not
given
to
much
talking
,
but
what
little
he
did
say
was
generally
well
said
.
<EOS>
His
reading
seldom
went
beyond
romances
and
poetry
of
the
lightest
and
not
always
most
moral
description
.
<EOS>
He
was
thoroughly
a
_
bon
vivant
_
;
an
accomplished
judge
of
wine
,
though
he
never
drank
to
excess
;
and
a
most
inexorable
critic
in
all
affairs
touching
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
He
had
had
much
to
forgive
in
his
own
family
,
since
a
family
had
grown
up
around
him
,
and
had
forgiven
everything
 
except
inattention
to
his
dinner
.
<EOS>
His
weakness
in
that
respect
was
now
fully
understood
,
and
his
temper
but
seldom
tried
.
<EOS>
As
Dr.
Stanhope
was
a
clergyman
,
it
may
be
supposed
that
his
religious
convictions
made
up
a
considerable
part
of
his
character
,
but
this
was
not
so
.
<EOS>
That
he
had
religious
convictions
must
be
believed
,
but
he
rarely
obtruded
them
,
even
on
his
children
.
<EOS>
This
abstinence
on
his
part
was
not
systematic
,
but
very
characteristic
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
he
had
predetermined
never
to
influence
their
thoughts
,
but
he
was
so
habitually
idle
that
his
time
for
doing
so
had
never
come
till
the
opportunity
for
doing
so
was
gone
forever
.
<EOS>
Whatever
conviction
the
father
may
have
had
,
the
children
were
at
any
rate
but
indifferent
members
of
the
church
from
which
he
drew
his
income
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
Dr.
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
The
features
of
Mrs.
Stanhope
's
character
were
even
less
plainly
marked
than
those
of
her
lord
.
<EOS>
The
_
far
niente
_
of
her
Italian
life
had
entered
into
her
very
soul
,
and
brought
her
to
regard
a
state
of
inactivity
as
the
only
earthly
good
.
<EOS>
In
manner
and
appearance
she
was
exceedingly
prepossessing
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
a
beauty
,
and
even
now
,
at
fifty
-
five
,
she
was
a
handsome
woman
.
<EOS>
Her
dress
was
always
perfect
:
<EOS>
she
never
dressed
but
once
in
the
day
,
and
never
appeared
till
between
three
and
four
;
but
when
she
did
appear
,
she
appeared
at
her
best
.
<EOS>
Whether
the
toil
rested
partly
with
her
,
or
wholly
with
her
handmaid
,
it
is
not
for
such
a
one
as
the
author
even
to
imagine
.
<EOS>
The
structure
of
her
attire
was
always
elaborate
and
yet
never
over
-
laboured
.
<EOS>
She
was
rich
in
apparel
but
not
bedizened
with
finery
;
her
ornaments
were
costly
,
rare
,
and
such
as
could
not
fail
to
attract
notice
,
but
they
did
not
look
as
though
worn
with
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
She
well
knew
the
great
architectural
secret
of
decorating
her
constructions
,
and
never
descended
to
construct
a
decoration
.
<EOS>
But
when
we
have
said
that
Mrs.
Stanhope
knew
how
to
dress
and
used
her
knowledge
daily
,
we
have
said
all
.
<EOS>
Other
purpose
in
life
<EOS>
she
had
none
.
<EOS>
It
was
something
,
indeed
,
that
she
did
not
interfere
with
the
purposes
of
others
.
<EOS>
In
early
life
she
had
undergone
great
trials
with
reference
to
the
doctor
's
dinners
,
but
for
the
last
ten
or
twelve
years
her
elder
daughter
Charlotte
had
taken
that
labour
off
her
hands
,
and
she
had
had
little
to
trouble
her
 
little
,
that
is
,
till
the
edict
for
this
terrible
English
journey
had
gone
forth
:
since
then
,
indeed
,
her
life
had
been
laborious
enough
.
<EOS>
For
such
a
one
,
the
toil
of
being
carried
from
the
shores
of
Como
to
the
city
of
Barchester
is
more
than
labour
enough
,
let
the
care
of
the
carriers
be
ever
so
vigilant
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Stanhope
had
been
obliged
to
have
every
one
of
her
dresses
taken
in
from
the
effects
of
the
journey
.
  
<EOS>
Charlotte
Stanhope
was
at
this
time
about
thirty
-
five
years
old
,
and
whatever
may
have
been
her
faults
,
she
had
none
of
those
which
belong
particularly
to
old
young
ladies
.
<EOS>
She
neither
dressed
young
,
nor
talked
young
,
nor
indeed
looked
young
.
<EOS>
She
appeared
to
be
perfectly
content
with
her
time
of
life
,
and
in
no
way
affected
the
graces
of
youth
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
fine
young
woman
,
and
had
she
been
a
man
,
would
have
been
a
very
fine
young
man
.
<EOS>
All
that
was
done
in
the
house
,
and
that
was
not
done
by
servants
,
was
done
by
her
.
<EOS>
She
gave
the
orders
,
paid
the
bills
,
hired
and
dismissed
the
domestics
,
made
the
tea
,
carved
the
meat
,
and
managed
everything
in
the
Stanhope
household
.
<EOS>
She
,
and
she
alone
,
could
ever
induce
her
father
to
look
into
the
state
of
his
worldly
concerns
.
<EOS>
She
,
and
she
alone
,
could
in
any
degree
control
the
absurdities
of
her
sister
.
<EOS>
She
,
and
she
alone
,
prevented
the
whole
family
from
falling
into
utter
disrepute
and
beggary
.
<EOS>
It
was
by
her
advice
that
they
now
found
themselves
very
unpleasantly
situated
in
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
So
far
,
the
character
of
Charlotte
Stanhope
is
not
unprepossessing
.
<EOS>
But
it
remains
to
be
said
that
the
influence
which
she
had
in
her
family
,
though
it
had
been
used
to
a
certain
extent
for
their
worldly
well
-
being
,
had
not
been
used
to
their
real
benefit
,
as
it
might
have
been
.
<EOS>
She
had
aided
her
father
in
his
indifference
to
his
professional
duties
,
counselling
him
that
his
livings
were
as
much
his
individual
property
as
the
estates
of
his
elder
brother
were
the
property
of
that
worthy
peer
.
<EOS>
She
had
for
years
past
stifled
every
little
rising
wish
for
a
return
to
England
which
the
doctor
had
from
time
to
time
expressed
.
<EOS>
She
had
encouraged
her
mother
in
her
idleness
,
in
order
that
she
herself
might
be
mistress
and
manager
of
the
Stanhope
household
.
<EOS>
She
had
encouraged
and
fostered
the
follies
of
her
sister
,
though
she
was
always
willing
,
and
often
able
,
to
protect
her
from
their
probable
result
.
<EOS>
She
had
done
her
best
,
and
had
thoroughly
succeeded
in
spoiling
her
brother
,
and
turning
him
loose
upon
the
world
an
idle
man
without
a
profession
and
without
a
shilling
that
he
could
call
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Stanhope
was
a
clever
woman
,
able
to
talk
on
most
subjects
,
and
quite
indifferent
as
to
what
the
subject
was
.
<EOS>
She
prided
herself
on
her
freedom
from
English
prejudice
,
and
,
she
might
have
added
,
from
feminine
delicacy
.
<EOS>
On
religion
she
was
a
pure
free
-
thinker
,
and
with
much
want
of
true
affection
,
delighted
to
throw
out
her
own
views
before
the
troubled
mind
of
her
father
.
<EOS>
To
have
shaken
what
remained
of
his
Church
of
England
faith
would
have
gratified
her
much
,
but
the
idea
of
his
abandoning
his
preferment
in
the
church
had
never
once
presented
itself
to
her
mind
.
<EOS>
How
could
he
indeed
,
when
he
had
no
income
from
any
other
source
?
  
<EOS>
But
the
two
most
prominent
members
of
the
family
still
remain
to
be
described
.
<EOS>
The
second
child
had
been
christened
Madeline
and
had
been
a
great
beauty
.
<EOS>
We
need
not
say
had
been
,
for
she
was
never
more
beautiful
than
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
,
though
her
person
for
many
years
had
been
disfigured
by
an
accident
.
<EOS>
It
is
unnecessary
that
we
should
give
in
detail
the
early
history
of
Madeline
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
She
had
gone
to
Italy
when
about
seventeen
years
of
age
,
and
had
been
allowed
to
make
the
most
of
her
surpassing
beauty
in
the
salons
of
Milan
and
among
the
crowded
villas
along
the
shores
of
the
Lake
of
Como
.
<EOS>
She
had
become
famous
for
adventures
in
which
her
character
was
just
not
lost
,
and
had
destroyed
the
hearts
of
a
dozen
cavaliers
without
once
being
touched
in
her
own
.
<EOS>
Blood
had
flowed
in
quarrels
about
her
charms
,
and
she
had
heard
of
these
encounters
with
pleasurable
excitement
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
told
of
her
that
on
one
occasion
she
had
stood
by
in
the
disguise
of
a
page
and
had
seen
her
lover
fall
.
  
<EOS>
As
is
so
often
the
case
,
she
had
married
the
very
worst
of
those
who
sought
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Why
she
had
chosen
Paulo
Neroni
,
a
man
of
no
birth
and
no
property
,
a
mere
captain
in
the
Pope
's
guard
,
one
who
had
come
up
to
Milan
either
simply
as
an
adventurer
or
else
as
a
spy
,
a
man
of
harsh
temper
and
oily
manners
,
<EOS>
mean
in
figure
,
swarthy
in
face
,
and
so
false
in
words
as
to
be
hourly
detected
,
<EOS>
need
not
now
be
told
.
<EOS>
When
the
moment
for
doing
so
came
,
she
had
probably
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
He
,
at
any
rate
,
had
become
her
husband
,
and
after
a
prolonged
honeymoon
among
the
lakes
,
they
had
gone
together
to
Rome
,
the
papal
captain
having
vainly
endeavoured
to
induce
his
wife
to
remain
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
Six
months
afterwards
she
arrived
at
her
father
's
house
a
cripple
,
and
a
mother
.
<EOS>
She
had
arrived
without
even
notice
,
with
hardly
clothes
to
cover
her
,
and
without
one
of
those
many
ornaments
which
had
graced
her
bridal
trousseau
.
<EOS>
Her
baby
was
in
the
arms
of
a
poor
girl
from
Milan
,
whom
she
had
taken
in
exchange
for
the
Roman
maid
who
had
accompanied
her
thus
far
,
and
who
had
then
,
as
her
mistress
said
,
become
homesick
and
had
returned
.
<EOS>
It
was
clear
that
the
lady
had
determined
that
there
should
be
no
witness
to
tell
stories
of
her
life
in
Rome
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
fallen
,
she
said
,
in
ascending
a
ruin
,
and
had
fatally
injured
the
sinews
of
her
knee
;
so
fatally
that
when
she
stood
,
she
lost
eight
inches
of
her
accustomed
height
;
so
fatally
that
when
she
essayed
to
move
,
she
could
only
drag
herself
painfully
along
,
with
protruded
hip
and
extended
foot
,
in
a
manner
less
graceful
than
that
of
a
hunchback
.
<EOS>
She
had
consequently
made
up
her
mind
,
once
and
forever
,
that
she
would
never
stand
and
never
attempt
to
move
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Stories
were
not
slow
to
follow
her
,
averring
that
she
had
been
cruelly
ill
-
used
by
Neroni
,
and
that
to
his
violence
had
she
owed
her
accident
.
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
may
,
little
had
been
said
about
her
husband
,
but
that
little
had
made
it
clearly
intelligible
to
the
family
that
Signor
Neroni
was
to
be
seen
and
heard
of
no
more
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
question
as
to
readmitting
the
poor
,
ill
-
used
beauty
to
her
old
family
rights
,
no
question
as
to
adopting
her
infant
daughter
beneath
the
Stanhope
roof
-
tree
.
<EOS>
Though
heartless
,
the
Stanhopes
were
not
selfish
.
<EOS>
The
two
were
taken
in
,
petted
,
made
much
of
,
for
a
time
all
but
adored
,
and
then
felt
by
the
two
parents
to
be
great
nuisances
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
house
the
lady
was
,
and
there
she
remained
,
having
her
own
way
,
though
that
way
was
not
very
conformable
with
the
customary
usages
of
an
English
clergyman
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Neroni
,
though
forced
to
give
up
all
motion
in
the
world
,
had
no
intention
whatever
of
giving
up
the
world
itself
.
<EOS>
The
beauty
of
her
face
was
uninjured
,
and
that
beauty
was
of
a
peculiar
kind
.
<EOS>
Her
copious
rich
brown
hair
was
worn
in
Grecian
bandeaux
<EOS>
round
her
head
,
displaying
as
much
as
possible
of
her
forehead
and
cheeks
.
<EOS>
Her
forehead
,
though
rather
low
,
was
very
beautiful
from
its
perfect
contour
and
pearly
whiteness
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
long
and
large
,
and
marvellously
bright
;
might
I
venture
to
say
bright
as
Lucifer
's
,
I
should
perhaps
best
express
the
depth
of
their
brilliancy
.
<EOS>
They
were
dreadful
eyes
to
look
at
,
such
as
would
absolutely
deter
any
man
of
quiet
mind
and
easy
spirit
from
attempting
a
passage
of
arms
with
such
foes
.
<EOS>
There
was
talent
in
them
,
and
the
fire
of
passion
and
the
play
of
wit
,
but
there
was
no
love
.
<EOS>
Cruelty
was
there
instead
,
and
courage
,
a
desire
of
masterhood
,
cunning
,
and
a
wish
for
mischief
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
as
eyes
,
they
were
very
beautiful
.
<EOS>
The
eyelashes
were
long
and
perfect
,
and
the
long
,
steady
,
unabashed
gaze
with
which
she
would
look
into
the
face
of
her
admirer
fascinated
while
it
frightened
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
basilisk
from
whom
an
ardent
lover
of
beauty
could
make
no
escape
.
<EOS>
Her
nose
and
mouth
and
teeth
and
chin
and
neck
and
bust
were
perfect
,
much
more
so
at
twenty
-
eight
than
they
had
been
at
eighteen
.
<EOS>
What
wonder
that
with
such
charms
still
glowing
in
her
face
,
and
with
such
deformity
destroying
her
figure
,
she
should
resolve
to
be
seen
,
but
only
to
be
seen
reclining
on
a
sofa
.
  
<EOS>
Her
resolve
had
not
been
carried
out
without
difficulty
.
<EOS>
She
had
still
frequented
the
opera
at
Milan
;
she
had
still
been
seen
occasionally
in
the
salons
of
the
noblesse
;
she
had
caused
herself
to
be
carried
in
and
out
from
her
carriage
,
and
that
in
such
a
manner
as
in
no
wise
to
disturb
her
charms
,
disarrange
her
dress
,
or
expose
her
deformities
.
<EOS>
Her
sister
always
accompanied
her
and
a
maid
,
a
manservant
also
,
and
on
state
occasions
,
two
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
that
her
purpose
could
have
been
achieved
with
less
;
and
yet
,
poor
as
she
was
,
she
had
achieved
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
And
then
again
the
more
dissolute
Italian
youths
of
Milan
frequented
the
Stanhope
villa
and
surrounded
her
couch
,
not
greatly
to
her
father
's
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
his
spirit
would
rise
,
a
dark
spot
would
show
itself
on
his
cheek
,
and
he
would
rebel
,
but
Charlotte
would
assuage
him
with
some
peculiar
triumph
of
her
culinary
art
and
all
again
would
be
smooth
for
awhile
.
  
<EOS>
Madeline
affected
all
manner
of
rich
and
quaint
devices
in
the
garniture
of
her
room
,
her
person
,
and
her
feminine
belongings
.
<EOS>
In
nothing
was
this
more
apparent
than
in
the
visiting
card
which
she
had
prepared
for
her
use
.
<EOS>
For
such
an
article
one
would
say
that
she
,
in
her
present
state
,
could
have
but
small
need
,
seeing
how
improbable
it
was
that
she
should
make
a
morning
call
:
but
not
such
was
her
own
opinion
.
<EOS>
Her
card
was
surrounded
by
a
deep
border
of
gilding
;
on
this
she
had
imprinted
,
in
three
lines
  
La
Signora
Madeline
Vesey
Neroni
.
 
<EOS>
Nata
Stanhope
.
  
<EOS>
And
over
the
name
she
had
a
bright
gilt
coronet
,
which
certainly
looked
very
magnificent
.
<EOS>
How
she
had
come
to
concoct
such
a
name
for
herself
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
.
<EOS>
Her
father
had
been
christened
Vesey
as
another
man
is
christened
Thomas
,
and
she
had
no
more
right
to
assume
it
than
would
have
the
daughter
of
a
Mr.
Josiah
Jones
to
call
herself
Mrs.
Josiah
Smith
,
on
marrying
a
man
of
the
latter
name
.
<EOS>
The
gold
coronet
was
equally
out
of
place
,
and
perhaps
inserted
with
even
less
excuse
.
<EOS>
Paulo
Neroni
had
had
not
the
faintest
title
to
call
himself
a
scion
of
even
Italian
nobility
.
<EOS>
Had
the
pair
met
in
England
<EOS>
Neroni
would
probably
have
been
a
count
,
but
they
had
met
in
Italy
,
and
any
such
pretence
on
his
part
would
have
been
simply
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
A
coronet
,
however
,
was
a
pretty
ornament
,
and
if
it
could
solace
a
poor
cripple
to
have
such
on
her
card
,
who
would
begrudge
it
to
her
?
  
<EOS>
Of
her
husband
,
or
of
his
individual
family
,
she
never
spoke
,
but
with
her
admirers
she
would
often
allude
in
a
mysterious
way
to
her
married
life
and
isolated
state
,
and
,
pointing
to
her
daughter
,
would
call
her
the
last
of
the
blood
of
the
emperors
,
thus
referring
Neroni
's
extraction
to
the
old
Roman
family
from
which
the
worst
of
the
Caesars
sprang
.
  
<EOS>
The
"
signora
"
was
not
without
talent
and
not
without
a
certain
sort
of
industry
;
she
was
an
indomitable
letter
-
writer
,
and
her
letters
were
worth
the
postage
:
they
were
full
of
wit
,
mischief
,
satire
,
love
,
latitudinarian
philosophy
,
free
religion
,
and
,
sometimes
,
alas
,
loose
ribaldry
.
<EOS>
The
subject
,
however
,
depended
entirely
on
the
recipient
,
and
she
was
prepared
to
correspond
with
anyone
but
moral
young
ladies
or
stiff
old
women
.
<EOS>
She
wrote
also
a
kind
of
poetry
,
generally
in
Italian
,
and
short
romances
,
generally
in
French
.
<EOS>
She
read
much
of
a
desultory
sort
of
literature
,
and
as
a
modern
linguist
had
really
made
great
proficiency
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
lady
who
had
now
come
to
wound
the
hearts
of
the
men
of
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
Ethelbert
Stanhope
was
in
some
respects
like
his
younger
sister
,
but
he
was
less
inestimable
as
a
man
than
she
as
a
woman
.
<EOS>
His
great
fault
was
an
entire
absence
of
that
principle
which
should
have
induced
him
,
as
the
son
of
a
man
without
fortune
,
to
earn
his
own
bread
.
<EOS>
Many
attempts
had
been
made
to
get
him
to
do
so
,
but
these
had
all
been
frustrated
,
not
so
much
by
idleness
on
his
part
as
by
a
disinclination
to
exert
himself
in
any
way
not
to
his
taste
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
educated
at
Eton
and
had
been
intended
for
the
Church
,
but
he
had
left
Cambridge
in
disgust
after
a
single
term
,
and
notified
to
his
father
his
intention
to
study
for
the
bar
.
<EOS>
Preparatory
to
that
,
he
thought
it
well
that
he
should
attend
a
German
university
,
and
consequently
went
to
Leipzig
.
<EOS>
There
he
remained
two
years
and
brought
away
a
knowledge
of
German
and
a
taste
for
the
fine
arts
.
<EOS>
He
still
,
however
,
intended
himself
for
the
bar
,
took
chambers
,
engaged
himself
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
a
learned
pundit
,
and
spent
a
season
in
London
.
<EOS>
He
there
found
that
all
his
aptitudes
inclined
him
to
the
life
of
an
artist
,
and
he
determined
to
live
by
painting
.
<EOS>
With
this
object
he
returned
to
Milan
,
and
had
himself
rigged
out
for
Rome
.
<EOS>
As
a
painter
he
might
have
earned
his
bread
,
for
he
wanted
only
diligence
to
excel
,
but
when
at
Rome
his
mind
was
carried
away
by
other
things
:
he
soon
wrote
home
for
money
,
saying
that
he
had
been
converted
to
the
Mother
Church
,
that
he
was
already
an
acolyte
of
the
Jesuits
,
and
that
he
was
about
to
start
with
others
to
Palestine
on
a
mission
for
converting
Jews
.
<EOS>
He
did
go
to
Judea
,
but
being
unable
to
convert
the
Jews
,
was
converted
by
them
.
<EOS>
He
again
wrote
home
,
to
say
that
Moses
was
the
only
giver
of
perfect
laws
to
the
world
,
that
the
coming
of
the
true
Messiah
was
at
hand
,
that
great
things
were
doing
in
Palestine
,
and
that
he
had
met
one
of
the
family
of
Sidonia
,
a
most
remarkable
man
,
who
was
now
on
his
way
to
western
Europe
,
and
whom
he
had
induced
to
deviate
from
his
route
with
the
object
of
calling
at
the
Stanhope
villa
.
<EOS>
Ethelbert
then
expressed
his
hope
that
his
mother
and
sisters
would
listen
to
this
wonderful
prophet
.
<EOS>
His
father
he
knew
could
not
do
so
from
pecuniary
considerations
.
<EOS>
This
Sidonia
,
however
,
did
not
take
so
strong
a
fancy
to
him
as
another
of
that
family
once
did
to
a
young
English
nobleman
.
<EOS>
At
least
he
provided
him
with
no
heaps
of
gold
as
large
as
lions
,
so
that
the
Judaized
Ethelbert
was
again
obliged
to
draw
on
the
revenues
of
the
Christian
Church
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
needless
to
tell
how
the
father
swore
that
he
would
send
no
more
money
and
receive
no
Jew
,
nor
how
Charlotte
declared
that
Ethelbert
could
not
be
left
penniless
in
Jerusalem
,
and
how
"
La
Signora
Neroni
"
resolved
to
have
Sidonia
at
her
feet
.
<EOS>
The
money
was
sent
,
and
the
Jew
did
come
.
<EOS>
The
Jew
did
come
,
but
he
was
not
at
all
to
the
taste
of
"
La
Signora
.
<EOS>
"
He
was
a
dirty
little
old
man
,
and
though
he
had
provided
no
golden
lions
<EOS>
,
he
had
,
it
seems
,
relieved
young
Stanhope
's
necessities
.
<EOS>
He
positively
refused
to
leave
the
villa
till
he
had
got
a
bill
from
the
doctor
on
his
London
bankers
.
  
<EOS>
Ethelbert
did
not
long
remain
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
He
soon
reappeared
at
the
villa
without
prejudices
on
the
subject
of
his
religion
,
and
with
a
firm
resolve
to
achieve
fame
and
fortune
as
a
sculptor
.
<EOS>
He
brought
with
him
some
models
which
he
had
originated
at
Rome
and
which
really
gave
such
fair
promise
that
his
father
was
induced
to
go
to
further
expense
in
furthering
these
views
.
<EOS>
Ethelbert
opened
an
establishment
,
or
rather
took
lodgings
and
a
workshop
,
at
Carrara
,
and
there
spoilt
much
marble
and
made
some
few
pretty
images
.
<EOS>
Since
that
period
,
now
four
years
ago
,
he
had
alternated
between
Carrara
and
the
villa
,
but
his
sojourns
at
the
workshop
became
shorter
and
shorter
and
those
at
the
villa
longer
and
longer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twas
no
wonder
,
for
Carrara
is
not
a
spot
in
which
an
Englishman
would
like
to
dwell
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
family
started
for
England
,
he
had
resolved
not
to
be
left
behind
,
and
,
with
the
assistance
of
his
elder
sister
,
had
carried
his
point
against
his
father
's
wishes
.
<EOS>
It
was
necessary
,
he
said
,
that
he
should
come
to
England
for
orders
.
<EOS>
How
otherwise
was
he
to
bring
his
profession
to
account
?
  
<EOS>
In
personal
appearance
Ethelbert
Stanhope
was
the
most
singular
of
beings
.
<EOS>
He
was
certainly
very
handsome
.
<EOS>
He
had
his
sister
Madeline
's
eyes
,
without
their
stare
and
without
their
hard
,
cunning
,
cruel
firmness
.
<EOS>
They
were
also
very
much
lighter
,
and
of
so
light
and
clear
a
blue
as
to
make
his
face
remarkable
,
if
nothing
else
did
so
.
<EOS>
On
entering
a
room
with
him
,
Ethelbert
's
blue
eyes
would
be
the
first
thing
you
would
see
,
and
on
leaving
it
almost
the
last
you
would
forget
.
<EOS>
His
light
hair
was
very
long
and
silky
,
coming
down
over
his
coat
.
<EOS>
His
beard
had
been
prepared
in
holy
land
,
and
was
patriarchal
.
<EOS>
He
never
shaved
and
rarely
trimmed
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
glossy
,
soft
,
clean
,
and
altogether
not
unprepossessing
.
<EOS>
It
was
such
that
ladies
might
desire
to
reel
it
off
and
work
it
into
their
patterns
in
lieu
of
floss
silk
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
was
fair
and
almost
pink
;
he
was
small
in
height
and
slender
in
limb
,
but
well
-
made
;
and
his
voice
was
of
peculiar
sweetness
.
  
<EOS>
In
manner
and
dress
he
was
equally
remarkable
.
<EOS>
He
had
none
of
the
_
mauvaise
honte
_
of
an
Englishman
.
<EOS>
He
required
no
introduction
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
any
person
.
<EOS>
He
habitually
addressed
strangers
,
ladies
as
well
as
men
,
without
any
such
formality
,
and
in
doing
so
never
seemed
to
meet
with
rebuke
.
<EOS>
His
costume
can
not
be
described
because
it
was
so
various
,
but
it
was
always
totally
opposed
in
every
principle
of
colour
and
construction
to
the
dress
of
those
with
whom
he
for
the
time
consorted
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
habitually
addicted
to
making
love
to
ladies
,
and
did
so
without
any
scruples
of
conscience
,
or
any
idea
that
such
a
practice
was
amiss
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
heart
to
touch
himself
,
and
was
literally
unaware
that
humanity
was
subject
to
such
an
infliction
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
thought
much
about
it
,
but
,
had
he
been
asked
,
would
have
said
that
ill
-
treating
a
lady
's
heart
meant
injuring
her
promotion
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
His
principles
therefore
forbade
him
to
pay
attention
to
a
girl
if
he
thought
any
man
was
present
whom
it
might
suit
her
to
marry
.
<EOS>
In
this
manner
his
good
nature
frequently
interfered
with
his
amusement
,
but
he
had
no
other
motive
in
abstaining
from
the
fullest
declarations
of
love
to
every
girl
that
pleased
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Bertie
Stanhope
,
as
he
was
generally
called
,
was
,
however
,
popular
with
both
sexes
 
and
with
Italians
as
well
as
English
.
<EOS>
His
circle
of
acquaintance
was
very
large
and
embraced
people
of
all
sorts
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
respect
for
rank
,
and
no
aversion
to
those
below
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
lived
on
familiar
terms
with
English
peers
,
German
shopkeepers
,
and
Roman
priests
.
<EOS>
All
people
were
nearly
alike
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
above
,
or
rather
below
,
all
prejudices
.
<EOS>
No
virtue
could
charm
him
,
no
vice
shock
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
about
him
a
natural
good
manner
,
which
seemed
to
qualify
him
for
the
highest
circles
,
and
yet
he
was
never
out
of
place
in
the
lowest
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
principle
,
no
regard
for
others
,
no
self
-
respect
,
no
desire
to
be
other
than
a
drone
in
the
hive
,
if
only
he
could
,
as
a
drone
,
get
what
honey
was
sufficient
for
him
.
<EOS>
Of
honey
,
in
his
latter
days
,
it
may
probably
be
presaged
,
that
he
will
have
but
short
allowance
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
the
family
of
the
Stanhopes
,
who
,
at
this
period
,
suddenly
joined
themselves
to
the
ecclesiastical
circle
of
Barchester
close
.
<EOS>
Any
stranger
union
it
would
be
impossible
perhaps
to
conceive
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
not
as
though
they
all
fell
down
into
the
cathedral
precincts
hitherto
unknown
and
untalked
of
.
<EOS>
In
such
case
,
no
amalgamation
would
have
been
at
all
probable
between
the
new
-
comers
and
either
the
Proudie
set
or
the
Grantly
set
.
<EOS>
But
such
was
far
from
being
the
case
.
<EOS>
The
Stanhopes
were
all
known
by
name
in
Barchester
,
and
Barchester
was
prepared
to
receive
them
with
open
arms
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
was
one
of
her
prebendaries
,
one
of
her
rectors
,
one
of
her
pillars
of
strength
;
and
was
,
moreover
,
counted
on
as
a
sure
ally
both
by
Proudies
and
Grantlys
.
  
<EOS>
He
himself
was
the
brother
of
one
peer
,
and
his
wife
was
the
sister
of
another
 
and
both
these
peers
were
lords
of
Whiggish
tendency
,
with
whom
the
new
bishop
had
some
sort
of
alliance
.
<EOS>
This
was
sufficient
to
give
to
Mr.
Slope
high
hope
that
he
might
enlist
Dr.
Stanhope
on
his
side
,
before
his
enemies
could
outmanoeuvre
him
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
the
old
dean
had
many
many
years
ago
,
in
the
days
of
the
doctor
's
clerical
energies
,
been
instrumental
in
assisting
him
in
his
views
as
to
preferment
;
and
many
many
years
ago
also
,
the
two
doctors
,
Stanhope
and
Grantly
,
had
,
as
young
parsons
,
been
joyous
together
in
the
common
-
rooms
of
Oxford
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
,
consequently
,
did
not
doubt
but
that
the
newcomer
would
range
himself
under
his
banners
.
  
<EOS>
Little
did
any
of
them
dream
of
what
ingredients
the
Stanhope
family
was
now
composed
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
's
Reception
 
Commenced
 
<EOS>
The
bishop
and
his
wife
had
spent
only
three
or
four
days
in
Barchester
on
the
occasion
of
their
first
visit
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
had
,
as
we
have
seen
,
taken
his
seat
on
his
throne
,
but
his
demeanour
there
,
into
which
it
had
been
his
intention
to
infuse
much
hierarchal
dignity
,
had
been
a
good
deal
disarranged
by
the
audacity
of
his
chaplain
's
sermon
.
<EOS>
He
had
hardly
dared
to
look
his
clergy
in
the
face
,
and
to
declare
by
the
severity
of
his
countenance
that
in
truth
he
meant
all
that
his
factotum
was
saying
on
his
behalf
;
nor
yet
did
he
dare
to
throw
Mr.
Slope
over
,
and
show
to
those
around
him
that
he
was
no
party
to
the
sermon
,
and
would
resent
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
accordingly
blessed
his
people
in
a
shambling
manner
,
not
at
all
to
his
own
satisfaction
,
and
had
walked
back
to
his
palace
with
his
mind
very
doubtful
as
to
what
he
would
say
to
his
chaplain
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
remain
long
in
doubt
.
<EOS>
He
had
hardly
doffed
his
lawn
when
the
partner
of
all
his
toils
entered
his
study
and
exclaimed
even
before
she
had
seated
herself
<EOS>
:
  
"
Bishop
,
did
you
ever
hear
a
more
sublime
,
more
spirit
-
moving
,
more
appropriate
discourse
than
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
love
;
ha
 
hum
 
he
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
bishop
did
not
know
what
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
my
lord
,
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
disapprove
?
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
look
about
the
lady
's
eye
which
did
not
admit
of
my
lord
's
disapproving
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
if
he
intended
to
disapprove
,
it
must
be
now
or
never
;
but
he
also
felt
that
it
could
not
be
now
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
him
to
say
to
the
wife
of
his
bosom
that
Mr.
Slope
's
sermon
was
ill
-
timed
,
impertinent
,
and
vexatious
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
replied
the
bishop
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
ca
n't
say
I
disapprove
 
a
very
clever
sermon
and
very
well
intended
,
and
I
dare
say
will
do
a
great
deal
of
good
.
<EOS>
"
This
last
praise
was
added
,
seeing
that
what
he
had
already
said
by
no
means
satisfied
Mrs.
Proudie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
will
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
am
sure
it
was
well
deserved
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
in
your
life
,
bishop
,
hear
anything
so
like
play
-
acting
as
the
way
in
which
Mr.
Harding
sings
the
litany
?
<EOS>
I
shall
beg
Mr.
Slope
to
continue
a
course
of
sermons
on
the
subject
till
all
that
is
altered
.
<EOS>
We
will
have
at
any
rate
,
in
our
cathedral
,
a
decent
,
godly
,
modest
morning
service
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
no
more
play
-
acting
here
now
;
"
and
so
the
lady
rang
for
lunch
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
knew
more
about
cathedrals
and
deans
and
precentors
and
church
services
than
his
wife
did
,
and
also
more
of
a
bishop
's
powers
.
<EOS>
But
he
thought
it
better
at
present
to
let
the
subject
drop
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
think
we
must
go
back
to
London
on
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
I
find
my
staying
here
will
be
very
inconvenient
to
the
Government
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
knew
that
to
this
proposal
his
wife
would
not
object
,
and
he
also
felt
that
by
thus
retreating
from
the
ground
of
battle
the
heat
of
the
fight
might
be
got
over
in
his
absence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slope
will
remain
here
,
of
course
?
"
said
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
of
course
,
"
said
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
,
after
less
than
a
week
's
sojourn
in
his
palace
,
did
the
bishop
fly
from
Barchester
;
nor
did
he
return
to
it
for
two
months
,
the
London
season
being
then
over
.
<EOS>
During
that
time
Mr.
Slope
was
not
idle
,
but
he
did
not
again
essay
to
preach
in
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
Mrs.
Proudie
's
letters
advising
a
course
of
sermons
,
he
had
pleaded
that
he
would
at
any
rate
wish
to
put
off
such
an
undertaking
till
she
was
there
to
hear
them
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
employed
his
time
in
consolidating
a
Proudie
and
Slope
party
 
or
rather
a
Slope
and
Proudie
party
,
and
he
had
not
employed
his
time
in
vain
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
meddle
with
the
dean
and
chapter
,
except
by
giving
them
little
teasing
intimations
of
the
bishop
's
wishes
about
this
and
the
bishop
's
feelings
about
that
,
in
a
manner
which
was
to
them
sufficiently
annoying
,
but
which
they
could
not
resent
.
<EOS>
He
preached
once
or
twice
in
a
distant
church
in
the
suburbs
of
the
city
,
but
made
no
allusion
to
the
cathedral
service
.
<EOS>
He
commenced
the
establishment
of
two
"
Bishop
's
Barchester
Sabbath
-
day
schools
,
"
gave
notice
of
a
proposed
"
Bishop
's
Barchester
Young
Men
's
Sabbath
Evening
Lecture
Room
,
"
and
wrote
three
or
four
letters
to
the
manager
of
the
Barchester
branch
railway
,
informing
him
how
anxious
the
bishop
was
that
the
Sunday
trains
should
be
discontinued
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
two
months
,
however
,
the
bishop
and
the
lady
reappeared
,
and
as
a
happy
harbinger
of
their
return
,
heralded
their
advent
by
the
promise
of
an
evening
party
on
the
largest
scale
.
<EOS>
The
tickets
of
invitation
were
sent
out
from
London
 
<EOS>
they
were
dated
from
Bruton
Street
,
and
were
dispatched
by
the
odious
Sabbath
-
breaking
railway
,
in
a
huge
brown
paper
parcel
to
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Everybody
calling
himself
a
gentleman
,
or
herself
a
lady
,
within
the
city
of
Barchester
,
and
a
circle
of
two
miles
round
it
,
was
included
.
<EOS>
Tickets
were
sent
to
all
the
diocesan
clergy
,
and
also
to
many
other
persons
of
priestly
note
,
of
whose
absence
the
bishop
,
or
at
least
the
bishop
's
wife
,
felt
tolerably
confident
.
<EOS>
It
was
intended
,
however
,
to
be
a
thronged
and
noticeable
affair
,
and
preparations
were
made
for
receiving
some
hundreds
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
there
arose
considerable
agitation
among
the
Grantlyites
<EOS>
whether
or
no
they
would
attend
the
episcopal
bidding
.
<EOS>
The
first
feeling
with
them
all
was
to
send
the
briefest
excuses
both
for
themselves
and
their
wives
and
daughters
.
<EOS>
But
by
degrees
policy
prevailed
over
passion
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
perceived
that
he
would
be
making
a
false
step
if
he
allowed
the
cathedral
clergy
to
give
the
bishop
just
ground
of
umbrage
.
<EOS>
They
all
met
in
conclave
and
agreed
to
go
.
<EOS>
They
would
show
that
they
were
willing
to
respect
the
office
,
much
as
they
might
dislike
the
man
.
<EOS>
They
agreed
to
go
.
<EOS>
The
old
dean
would
crawl
in
,
if
it
were
but
for
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
The
chancellor
,
treasurer
,
archdeacon
,
prebendaries
,
and
minor
canons
would
all
go
,
and
would
all
take
their
wives
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
was
especially
bidden
to
do
so
,
resolving
in
his
heart
to
keep
himself
far
removed
from
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Bold
was
determined
to
go
,
though
assured
by
her
father
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
such
a
sacrifice
on
her
part
.
<EOS>
When
all
Barchester
was
to
be
there
,
neither
Eleanor
nor
Mary
Bold
understood
why
they
should
stay
away
.
<EOS>
Had
they
not
been
invited
separately
?
<EOS>
And
had
not
a
separate
little
note
from
the
chaplain
,
couched
in
the
most
respectful
language
,
been
enclosed
with
the
huge
episcopal
card
?
  
<EOS>
And
the
Stanhopes
would
be
there
,
one
and
all
.
<EOS>
Even
the
lethargic
mother
would
so
far
bestir
herself
on
such
an
occasion
.
<EOS>
They
had
only
just
arrived
.
<EOS>
The
card
was
at
the
residence
waiting
for
them
.
<EOS>
No
one
in
Barchester
had
seen
them
.
<EOS>
What
better
opportunity
could
they
have
of
showing
themselves
to
the
Barchester
world
?
<EOS>
Some
few
old
friends
,
such
as
the
archdeacon
and
his
wife
,
had
called
and
had
found
the
doctor
and
his
eldest
daughter
,
but
the
_
élite
_
of
the
family
were
not
yet
known
.
  
<EOS>
The
doctor
indeed
wished
in
his
heart
to
prevent
the
signora
from
accepting
the
bishop
's
invitation
,
but
she
herself
had
fully
determined
that
she
would
accept
it
.
<EOS>
If
her
father
was
ashamed
of
having
his
daughter
carried
into
a
bishop
's
palace
,
she
had
no
such
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
I
shall
,
"
she
had
said
to
her
sister
who
had
gently
endeavoured
to
dissuade
her
,
by
saying
that
the
company
would
consist
wholly
of
parsons
and
parsons
"
wives
.
<EOS>
"
Parsons
,
I
suppose
,
are
much
the
same
as
other
men
,
if
you
strip
them
of
their
black
coats
;
and
as
to
their
wives
,
I
dare
say
they
wo
n't
trouble
me
.
<EOS>
You
may
tell
Papa
<EOS>
I
do
n't
at
all
mean
to
be
left
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Papa
was
told
,
and
felt
that
he
could
do
nothing
but
yield
.
<EOS>
He
also
felt
that
it
was
useless
for
him
now
to
be
ashamed
of
his
children
.
<EOS>
Such
as
they
were
,
they
had
become
such
under
his
auspices
;
as
he
had
made
his
bed
,
so
he
must
lie
upon
it
;
as
he
had
sown
his
seed
,
so
must
he
reap
his
corn
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
indeed
utter
such
reflexions
in
such
language
,
but
such
was
the
gist
of
his
thought
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
because
Madeline
was
a
cripple
that
he
shrank
from
seeing
her
made
one
of
the
bishop
's
guests
,
but
because
he
knew
that
she
would
practise
her
accustomed
lures
,
and
behave
herself
in
a
way
that
could
not
fail
of
being
distasteful
to
the
propriety
of
Englishwomen
.
<EOS>
These
things
had
annoyed
but
not
shocked
him
in
Italy
.
<EOS>
There
they
had
shocked
no
one
;
but
here
in
Barchester
,
here
among
his
fellow
parsons
,
he
was
ashamed
that
they
should
be
seen
.
<EOS>
Such
had
been
his
feelings
,
but
he
repressed
them
.
<EOS>
What
if
his
brother
clergymen
were
shocked
!
<EOS>
They
could
not
take
from
him
his
preferment
because
the
manners
of
his
married
daughter
were
too
free
.
  
<EOS>
La
Signora
Neroni
had
,
at
any
rate
,
<EOS>
no
fear
that
she
would
shock
anybody
.
<EOS>
Her
ambition
was
to
create
a
sensation
,
to
have
parsons
at
her
feet
,
seeing
that
the
manhood
of
Barchester
consisted
mainly
of
parsons
,
and
to
send
,
if
possible
,
every
parson
's
wife
home
with
a
green
fit
of
jealousy
.
<EOS>
None
could
be
too
old
for
her
,
and
hardly
any
too
young
.
<EOS>
None
too
sanctified
,
and
none
too
worldly
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
prepared
to
entrap
the
bishop
himself
,
and
then
to
turn
up
her
nose
at
the
bishop
's
wife
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
doubt
of
success
,
for
she
had
always
succeeded
;
but
one
thing
was
absolutely
necessary
;
she
must
secure
the
entire
use
of
a
sofa
.
  
<EOS>
The
card
sent
to
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Stanhope
and
family
had
been
so
sent
in
an
envelope
having
on
the
cover
Mr.
Slope
's
name
.
<EOS>
The
signora
soon
learnt
that
Mrs.
Proudie
was
not
yet
at
the
palace
and
that
the
chaplain
was
managing
everything
.
<EOS>
It
was
much
more
in
her
line
to
apply
to
him
than
to
the
lady
,
and
she
accordingly
wrote
him
the
prettiest
little
billet
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
In
five
lines
she
explained
everything
,
declared
how
impossible
it
was
for
her
not
to
be
desirous
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
such
persons
as
the
Bishop
of
Barchester
and
his
wife
,
and
she
might
add
also
of
Mr.
Slope
,
depicted
her
own
grievous
state
,
and
concluded
by
being
assured
that
Mrs.
Proudie
would
forgive
her
extreme
hardihood
in
petitioning
to
be
allowed
to
be
carried
to
a
sofa
.
<EOS>
She
then
enclosed
one
of
her
beautiful
cards
.
<EOS>
In
return
she
received
as
polite
an
answer
from
Mr.
Slope
 
<EOS>
a
sofa
should
be
kept
in
the
large
drawing
-
room
,
immediately
at
the
top
of
the
grand
stairs
,
especially
for
her
use
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
the
day
of
the
party
had
arrived
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
and
his
wife
came
down
from
town
only
on
the
morning
of
the
eventful
day
,
as
behoved
such
great
people
to
do
,
but
Mr.
Slope
had
toiled
day
and
night
to
see
that
everything
should
be
in
right
order
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
much
to
do
.
<EOS>
No
company
had
been
seen
in
the
palace
since
heaven
knows
when
.
<EOS>
New
furniture
had
been
required
,
new
pots
and
pans
,
new
cups
and
saucers
,
new
dishes
and
plates
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
had
at
first
declared
that
she
would
condescend
to
nothing
so
vulgar
as
eating
and
drinking
,
but
Mr.
Slope
had
talked
,
or
rather
written
her
out
of
economy
.
<EOS>
Bishops
should
be
given
to
hospitality
,
and
hospitality
meant
eating
and
drinking
.
<EOS>
So
the
supper
was
conceded
;
the
guests
,
however
,
were
to
stand
as
they
consumed
it
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
four
rooms
opening
into
each
other
on
the
first
floor
of
the
house
,
which
were
denominated
the
drawing
-
rooms
,
the
reception
-
room
,
and
Mrs.
Proudie
's
boudoir
.
<EOS>
In
olden
days
one
of
these
had
been
Bishop
Grantly
's
bedroom
,
and
another
his
common
sitting
-
room
and
study
.
<EOS>
The
present
bishop
,
however
,
had
been
moved
down
into
a
back
parlour
and
had
been
given
to
understand
that
he
could
very
well
receive
his
clergy
in
the
dining
-
room
,
should
they
arrive
in
too
large
a
flock
to
be
admitted
into
his
small
sanctum
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
unwilling
to
yield
,
but
after
a
short
debate
had
yielded
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
's
heart
beat
high
as
she
inspected
her
suite
of
rooms
.
<EOS>
They
were
really
very
magnificent
,
or
at
least
would
be
so
by
candlelight
,
and
they
had
nevertheless
been
got
up
with
commendable
economy
.
<EOS>
Large
rooms
when
full
of
people
and
full
of
light
look
well
,
because
they
are
large
,
and
are
full
,
and
are
light
.
<EOS>
Small
rooms
are
those
which
require
costly
fittings
and
rich
furniture
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
knew
this
,
and
made
the
most
of
it
;
she
had
therefore
a
huge
gas
lamp
with
a
dozen
burners
hanging
from
each
of
the
ceilings
.
  
<EOS>
People
were
to
arrive
at
ten
,
supper
was
to
last
from
twelve
till
one
,
and
at
half
-
past
one
everybody
was
to
be
gone
.
<EOS>
Carriages
were
to
come
in
at
the
gate
in
the
town
and
depart
at
the
gate
outside
.
<EOS>
They
were
desired
to
take
up
at
a
quarter
before
one
.
<EOS>
It
was
managed
excellently
,
and
Mr.
Slope
was
invaluable
.
  
<EOS>
At
half
-
past
nine
the
bishop
and
his
wife
and
their
three
daughters
entered
the
great
reception
-
room
,
and
very
grand
and
very
solemn
they
were
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
was
downstairs
giving
the
last
orders
about
the
wine
.
<EOS>
He
well
understood
that
curates
and
country
vicars
with
their
belongings
did
not
require
so
generous
an
article
as
the
dignitaries
of
the
close
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
useful
gradation
in
such
things
,
and
Marsala
at
20s
.
<EOS>
a
dozen
did
very
well
for
the
exterior
supplementary
tables
in
the
corner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bishop
,
"
said
the
lady
,
as
his
lordship
sat
himself
down
,
"
do
n't
sit
on
that
sofa
,
if
you
please
;
it
is
to
be
kept
separate
for
a
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
jumped
up
and
seated
himself
on
a
cane
-
bottomed
chair
.
"
<EOS>
A
lady
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
meekly
;
"
do
you
mean
one
particular
lady
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
Bishop
,
one
particular
lady
,
"
said
his
wife
,
disdaining
to
explain
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
got
no
legs
,
Papa
,
"
said
the
youngest
daughter
,
tittering
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
legs
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
bishop
,
opening
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
Netta
,
what
stuff
you
talk
,
"
said
Olivia
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
got
legs
,
but
she
ca
n't
use
them
.
<EOS>
She
has
always
to
be
kept
lying
down
,
and
three
or
four
men
carry
her
about
everywhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Laws
,
how
odd
!
"
said
Augusta
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Always
carried
about
by
four
men
!
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
should
n't
like
it
.
<EOS>
Am
I
right
behind
,
Mamma
?
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
I
was
open
;
"
and
she
turned
her
back
to
her
anxious
parent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Open
!
<EOS>
To
be
sure
you
are
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
a
yard
of
petticoat
strings
hanging
out
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
I
pay
such
high
wages
to
Mrs.
Richards
if
she
ca
n't
take
the
trouble
to
see
whether
or
no
you
are
fit
to
be
looked
at
,
"
and
Mrs.
Proudie
poked
the
strings
here
,
and
twitched
the
dress
there
,
and
gave
her
daughter
a
shove
and
a
shake
,
and
then
pronounced
it
all
right
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
rejoined
the
bishop
,
who
was
dying
with
curiosity
about
the
mysterious
lady
and
her
legs
,
"
who
is
it
that
is
to
have
the
sofa
?
<EOS>
What
's
her
name
,
Netta
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
thundering
rap
at
the
front
door
interrupted
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
stood
up
and
shook
herself
gently
,
and
touched
her
cap
on
each
side
as
she
looked
in
the
mirror
.
<EOS>
Each
of
the
girls
stood
on
tiptoe
and
rearranged
the
bows
on
their
bosoms
,
and
Mr.
Slope
rushed
upstairs
three
steps
at
a
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
who
is
it
,
Netta
?
<EOS>
"
whispered
the
bishop
to
his
youngest
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
La
Signora
Madeline
Vesey
Neroni
,
"
whispered
back
the
daughter
;
"
and
mind
you
do
n't
let
anyone
sit
upon
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
La
Signora
Madeline
Vicinironi
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
to
himself
the
bewildered
prelate
.
<EOS>
Had
he
been
told
that
the
Begum
of
Oude
was
to
be
there
,
or
Queen
Pomara
of
the
Western
Isles
,
he
could
not
have
been
more
astonished
.
<EOS>
La
Signora
Madeline
Vicinironi
,
who
,
having
no
legs
to
stand
on
,
had
bespoken
a
sofa
in
his
drawing
-
room
!
<EOS>
Who
could
she
be
?
<EOS>
He
however
could
now
make
no
further
inquiry
,
as
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Stanhope
were
announced
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
sent
on
out
of
the
way
a
little
before
the
time
,
in
order
that
the
signora
might
have
plenty
of
time
to
get
herself
conveniently
packed
into
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
was
all
smiles
for
the
prebendary
's
wife
,
and
the
bishop
's
wife
was
all
smiles
for
the
prebendary
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
was
presented
and
was
delighted
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
one
of
whom
he
had
heard
so
much
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
bowed
very
low
,
and
then
looked
as
though
he
could
not
return
the
compliment
as
regarded
Mr.
Slope
,
of
whom
,
indeed
,
he
had
heard
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
,
in
spite
of
his
long
absence
,
knew
an
English
gentleman
when
he
saw
him
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
the
guests
came
in
shoals
:
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Quiverful
and
their
three
grown
daughters
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Chadwick
and
their
three
daughters
.
<EOS>
The
burly
chancellor
and
his
wife
and
clerical
son
from
Oxford
.
<EOS>
The
meagre
little
doctor
without
incumbrance
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
with
Eleanor
and
Miss
Bold
.
<EOS>
The
dean
leaning
on
a
gaunt
spinster
,
his
only
child
now
living
with
him
,
a
lady
very
learned
in
stones
,
ferns
,
plants
,
and
vermin
,
and
who
had
written
a
book
about
petals
.
<EOS>
A
wonderful
woman
in
her
way
was
Miss
Trefoil
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Finnie
,
the
attorney
,
with
his
wife
,
was
to
be
seen
,
much
to
the
dismay
of
many
who
had
never
met
him
in
a
drawing
-
room
before
.
<EOS>
The
five
Barchester
doctors
were
all
there
,
and
old
Scalpen
,
the
retired
apothecary
and
tooth
-
drawer
,
who
was
first
taught
to
consider
himself
as
belonging
to
the
higher
orders
by
the
receipt
of
the
bishop
's
card
.
<EOS>
Then
came
the
archdeacon
and
his
wife
with
their
elder
daughter
Griselda
,
a
slim
,
pale
,
retiring
girl
of
seventeen
who
kept
close
to
her
mother
,
and
looked
out
on
the
world
with
quiet
watchful
eyes
,
one
who
gave
promise
of
much
beauty
when
time
should
have
ripened
it
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
the
rooms
became
full
,
and
knots
were
formed
,
and
every
newcomer
paid
his
respects
to
my
lord
and
passed
on
,
not
presuming
to
occupy
too
much
of
the
great
man
's
attention
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
shook
hands
very
heartily
with
Dr.
Stanhope
,
and
Mrs.
Grantly
seated
herself
by
the
doctor
's
wife
.
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Proudie
moved
about
with
well
-
regulated
grace
,
measuring
out
the
quantity
of
her
favours
to
the
quality
of
her
guests
,
just
as
Mr.
Slope
had
been
doing
with
the
wine
.
<EOS>
But
the
sofa
was
still
empty
,
and
five
-
and
-
twenty
ladies
and
five
gentlemen
had
been
courteously
warned
off
it
by
the
mindful
chaplain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
does
n't
she
come
?
"
said
the
bishop
to
himself
.
<EOS>
His
mind
was
so
preoccupied
with
the
signora
that
he
hardly
remembered
how
to
behave
himself
_
en
bishop
_
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
a
carriage
dashed
up
to
the
hall
steps
with
a
very
different
manner
of
approach
from
that
of
any
other
vehicle
that
had
been
there
that
evening
.
<EOS>
A
perfect
commotion
took
place
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
,
who
heard
it
as
he
was
standing
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
knew
that
his
daughter
was
coming
,
and
retired
into
the
furthest
corner
,
where
he
might
not
see
her
entrance
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
perked
herself
up
,
feeling
that
some
important
piece
of
business
was
in
hand
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
was
instinctively
aware
that
La
Signora
Vicinironi
was
come
at
last
,
and
Mr.
Slope
hurried
into
the
hall
to
give
his
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
,
however
,
nearly
knocked
down
and
trampled
on
by
the
cortège
that
he
encountered
on
the
hall
steps
.
<EOS>
He
got
himself
picked
up
,
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
followed
the
cortège
upstairs
.
<EOS>
The
signora
was
carried
head
foremost
,
her
head
being
the
care
of
her
brother
and
an
Italian
manservant
who
was
accustomed
to
the
work
;
her
feet
were
in
the
care
of
the
lady
's
maid
and
the
lady
's
Italian
page
;
and
Charlotte
Stanhope
followed
to
see
that
all
was
done
with
due
grace
and
decorum
.
<EOS>
In
this
manner
they
climbed
easily
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
a
broad
way
through
the
crowd
having
been
opened
,
the
signora
rested
safely
on
her
couch
.
<EOS>
She
had
sent
a
servant
beforehand
to
learn
whether
it
was
a
right-
or
a
left
-
hand
sofa
,
for
it
required
that
she
should
dress
accordingly
,
particularly
as
regarded
her
bracelets
.
  
<EOS>
And
very
becoming
her
dress
was
.
<EOS>
It
was
white
velvet
,
without
any
other
garniture
than
rich
white
lace
worked
with
pearls
across
her
bosom
,
and
the
same
round
the
armlets
of
her
dress
.
<EOS>
Across
her
brow
she
wore
a
band
of
red
velvet
,
on
the
centre
of
which
shone
a
magnificent
Cupid
in
mosaic
,
the
tints
of
whose
wings
were
of
the
most
lovely
azure
,
and
the
colour
of
his
chubby
cheeks
the
clearest
pink
.
<EOS>
On
the
one
arm
which
her
position
required
her
to
expose
<EOS>
she
wore
three
magnificent
bracelets
,
each
of
different
stones
.
<EOS>
Beneath
her
on
the
sofa
,
and
over
the
cushion
and
head
of
it
,
was
spread
a
crimson
silk
mantle
or
shawl
,
which
went
under
her
whole
body
and
concealed
her
feet
.
<EOS>
Dressed
as
she
was
and
looking
as
she
did
,
so
beautiful
and
yet
so
motionless
,
with
the
pure
brilliancy
of
her
white
dress
brought
out
and
strengthened
by
the
colour
beneath
it
,
with
that
lovely
head
,
and
those
large
,
bold
,
bright
,
staring
eyes
,
it
was
impossible
that
either
man
or
woman
should
do
other
than
look
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
Neither
man
nor
woman
for
some
minutes
did
do
other
.
  
<EOS>
Her
bearers
too
were
worthy
of
note
.
<EOS>
The
three
servants
were
Italian
,
and
though
perhaps
not
peculiar
in
their
own
country
,
were
very
much
so
in
the
palace
at
Barchester
.
<EOS>
The
man
especially
attracted
notice
and
created
a
doubt
in
the
mind
of
some
whether
he
were
a
friend
or
a
domestic
.
<EOS>
The
same
doubt
was
felt
as
to
Ethelbert
.
<EOS>
The
man
was
attired
in
a
loose
-
fitting
,
common
,
black
-
cloth
morning
-
coat
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
jaunty
,
fat
,
well
-
pleased
,
clean
face
on
which
no
atom
of
beard
appeared
,
and
he
wore
round
his
neck
a
loose
,
black
silk
neck
-
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
essayed
to
make
him
a
bow
,
but
the
man
,
who
was
well
trained
,
took
no
notice
of
him
and
walked
out
of
the
room
quite
at
his
ease
,
followed
by
the
woman
and
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
Ethelbert
Stanhope
was
dressed
in
light
blue
from
head
to
foot
.
<EOS>
He
had
on
the
loosest
possible
blue
coat
,
cut
square
like
a
shooting
coat
,
and
very
short
.
<EOS>
It
was
lined
with
silk
of
azure
blue
.
<EOS>
He
had
on
a
blue
satin
waistcoat
,
a
blue
neck
-
handkerchief
which
was
fastened
beneath
his
throat
with
a
coral
ring
,
and
very
loose
blue
trousers
which
almost
concealed
his
feet
.
<EOS>
His
soft
,
glossy
beard
was
softer
and
more
glossy
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
,
who
had
made
one
mistake
,
thought
that
he
also
was
a
servant
and
therefore
tried
to
make
way
for
him
to
pass
.
<EOS>
But
Ethelbert
soon
corrected
the
error
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
's
Reception
 
Concluded
 
"
Bishop
of
Barchester
,
I
presume
?
"
said
Bertie
Stanhope
,
putting
out
his
hand
frankly
;
"
I
am
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
We
are
in
rather
close
quarters
here
,
a'nt
we
?
"
  
<EOS>
In
truth
they
were
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
crowded
up
behind
the
head
of
the
sofa
 
<EOS>
the
bishop
in
waiting
to
receive
his
guest
,
and
the
other
in
carrying
her
 
and
<EOS>
they
now
had
hardly
room
to
move
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
gave
his
hand
quickly
,
made
his
little
studied
bow
,
and
was
delighted
to
make
 
He
could
n't
go
on
,
for
he
did
not
know
whether
his
friend
was
a
signor
,
or
a
count
or
a
prince
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
sister
really
puts
you
all
to
great
trouble
,
"
said
Bertie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
bishop
was
delighted
to
have
the
opportunity
of
welcoming
La
Signora
Vicinironi
 
so
at
least
he
said
 
and
attempted
to
force
his
way
round
to
the
front
of
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
at
any
rate
,
learnt
that
his
strange
guests
were
brother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
The
man
,
he
presumed
,
must
be
Signor
Vicinironi
 
or
count
,
or
prince
,
as
it
might
be
.
<EOS>
It
was
wonderful
<EOS>
what
good
English
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
There
was
just
a
twang
of
foreign
accent
,
and
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
like
Barchester
,
on
the
whole
?
"
asked
Bertie
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
,
looking
dignified
,
said
that
he
did
like
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
not
been
here
very
long
,
I
believe
,
"
said
Bertie
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
not
long
,
"
said
the
bishop
and
tried
again
to
make
his
way
between
the
back
of
the
sofa
and
a
heavy
rector
,
who
was
staring
over
it
at
the
grimaces
of
the
signora
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
n't
a
bishop
before
,
were
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
explained
that
this
was
the
first
diocese
he
had
held
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
 
I
thought
so
,
"
said
Bertie
,
"
but
you
are
changed
about
sometimes
,
a'nt
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Translations
are
occasionally
made
,
"
said
Dr.
Proudie
,
"
but
not
so
frequently
as
in
former
days
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
've
cut
them
all
down
to
pretty
nearly
the
same
figure
,
have
n't
they
?
"
said
Bertie
.
  
<EOS>
To
this
the
bishop
could
not
bring
himself
to
make
any
answer
,
but
again
attempted
to
move
the
rector
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
work
,
I
suppose
,
is
different
?
"
continued
Bertie
.
<EOS>
"
Is
there
much
to
do
here
,
at
Barchester
?
<EOS>
"
This
was
said
exactly
in
the
tone
that
a
young
Admiralty
clerk
might
use
in
asking
the
same
question
of
a
brother
acolyte
at
the
Treasury
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
work
of
a
bishop
of
the
Church
of
England
,
"
said
Dr.
Proudie
with
considerable
dignity
,
"
is
not
easy
.
<EOS>
The
responsibility
which
he
has
to
bear
is
very
great
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
?
"
said
Bertie
,
opening
wide
his
wonderful
blue
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
never
was
afraid
of
responsibility
.
<EOS>
I
once
had
thoughts
of
being
a
bishop
,
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Had
thoughts
of
being
a
bishop
!
"
said
Dr.
Proudie
,
much
amazed
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
,
a
parson
 
a
parson
first
,
you
know
,
and
a
bishop
afterwards
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
once
begun
,
I
'd
have
stuck
to
it
.
<EOS>
But
,
on
the
whole
,
I
like
the
Church
of
Rome
the
best
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
could
not
discuss
the
point
,
so
he
remained
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
there
's
my
father
,
"
continued
Bertie
;
"
he
has
n't
stuck
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
he
did
n't
like
saying
the
same
thing
over
so
often
.
<EOS>
By
the
by
,
Bishop
,
have
you
seen
my
father
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
was
more
amazed
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Had
he
seen
his
father
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
"
he
replied
;
he
had
not
yet
had
the
pleasure
:
he
hoped
he
might
;
and
,
as
he
said
so
,
he
resolved
to
bear
heavy
on
that
fat
,
immovable
rector
,
if
ever
he
had
the
power
of
doing
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
in
the
room
somewhere
,
"
said
Bertie
,
"
and
he
'll
turn
up
soon
.
<EOS>
By
the
by
,
do
you
know
much
about
the
Jews
?
"
  
<EOS>
At
last
the
bishop
saw
a
way
out
.
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
said
he
,
"
but
I
'm
forced
to
go
round
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
 
I
believe
I
'll
follow
in
your
wake
,
"
said
Bertie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Terribly
hot
 
is
n't
it
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
he
addressed
to
the
fat
rector
with
whom
he
had
brought
himself
into
the
closest
contact
.
<EOS>
"
They
've
got
this
sofa
into
the
worst
possible
part
of
the
room
;
suppose
we
move
it
.
<EOS>
Take
care
,
Madeline
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
sofa
had
certainly
been
so
placed
that
those
who
were
behind
it
found
great
difficulty
in
getting
out
;
there
was
but
a
narrow
gangway
,
which
one
person
could
stop
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
bad
arrangement
,
and
one
which
Bertie
thought
it
might
be
well
to
improve
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
care
,
Madeline
,
"
said
he
,
and
turning
to
the
fat
rector
,
added
,
"
Just
help
me
with
a
slight
push
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
rector
's
weight
was
resting
on
the
sofa
and
unwittingly
lent
all
its
impetus
to
accelerate
and
increase
the
motion
which
Bertie
intentionally
originated
.
<EOS>
The
sofa
rushed
from
its
moorings
and
ran
half
-
way
into
the
middle
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
was
standing
with
Mr.
Slope
in
front
of
the
signora
,
and
had
been
trying
to
be
condescending
and
sociable
;
but
she
was
not
in
the
very
best
of
tempers
,
for
she
found
that
,
whenever
she
spoke
to
the
lady
,
the
lady
replied
by
speaking
to
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
was
a
favourite
,
no
doubt
,
but
Mrs.
Proudie
had
no
idea
of
being
less
thought
of
than
the
chaplain
.
<EOS>
She
was
beginning
to
be
stately
,
stiff
,
and
offended
,
when
unfortunately
the
castor
of
the
sofa
caught
itself
in
her
lace
train
,
and
carried
away
<EOS>
there
is
no
saying
how
much
of
her
garniture
.
<EOS>
Gathers
were
heard
to
go
,
stitches
to
crack
,
plaits
to
fly
open
,
flounces
were
seen
to
fall
,
and
breadths
to
expose
themselves
;
a
long
ruin
of
rent
lace
disfigured
the
carpet
,
and
still
clung
to
the
vile
wheel
on
which
the
sofa
moved
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
when
a
granite
battery
is
raised
,
excellent
to
the
eyes
of
warfaring
men
,
is
its
strength
and
symmetry
admired
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
work
of
years
.
<EOS>
Its
neat
embrasures
,
its
finished
parapets
,
its
casemated
stories
show
all
the
skill
of
modern
science
.
<EOS>
But
,
anon
,
a
small
spark
is
applied
to
the
treacherous
fusee
 
<EOS>
a
cloud
of
dust
arises
to
the
heavens
 
<EOS>
and
then
nothing
is
to
be
seen
but
dirt
and
dust
and
ugly
fragments
.
  
<EOS>
We
know
what
was
the
wrath
of
Juno
when
her
beauty
was
despised
.
<EOS>
We
know
to
what
storms
of
passion
even
celestial
minds
can
yield
.
<EOS>
As
Juno
may
have
looked
at
Paris
on
Mount
Ida
,
so
did
Mrs.
Proudie
look
on
Ethelbert
Stanhope
when
he
pushed
the
leg
of
the
sofa
into
her
lace
train
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
idiot
,
Bertie
!
"
said
the
signora
,
seeing
what
had
been
done
and
what
were
to
be
the
consequences
.
  
<EOS>
"
Idiot
!
"
re
-
echoed
Mrs.
Proudie
,
as
though
the
word
were
not
half
strong
enough
to
express
the
required
meaning
;
"
I
'll
let
him
know
 
"
and
then
looking
round
to
learn
,
at
a
glance
,
the
worst
,
she
saw
that
at
present
it
behoved
her
to
collect
the
scattered
_
débris
_
of
her
dress
.
  
<EOS>
Bertie
,
when
he
saw
what
he
had
done
,
rushed
over
the
sofa
and
threw
himself
on
one
knee
before
the
offended
lady
.
<EOS>
His
object
,
doubtless
,
was
to
liberate
the
torn
lace
from
the
castor
,
but
he
looked
as
though
he
were
imploring
pardon
from
a
goddess
.
  
<EOS>
"
Unhand
it
,
sir
!
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
From
what
scrap
of
dramatic
poetry
she
had
extracted
the
word
can
not
be
said
,
but
it
must
have
rested
on
her
memory
,
and
now
seemed
opportunely
dignified
for
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
fly
to
the
looms
of
the
fairies
to
repair
the
damage
,
if
you
'll
only
forgive
me
,
"
said
Ethelbert
,
still
on
his
knees
.
  
<EOS>
"
Unhand
it
,
sir
!
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
with
redoubled
emphasis
,
and
all
but
furious
wrath
.
<EOS>
This
allusion
to
the
fairies
was
a
direct
mockery
and
intended
to
turn
her
into
ridicule
.
<EOS>
So
at
least
it
seemed
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
Unhand
it
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
almost
screamed
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
me
;
it
's
the
cursed
sofa
,
"
said
Bertie
,
looking
imploringly
in
her
face
and
holding
up
both
his
hands
to
show
that
he
was
not
touching
her
belongings
,
but
still
remaining
on
his
knees
.
  
<EOS>
Hereupon
the
Signora
laughed
;
not
loud
,
indeed
,
but
yet
audibly
.
<EOS>
And
as
the
tigress
bereft
of
her
young
will
turn
with
equal
anger
on
any
within
reach
,
so
did
Mrs.
Proudie
turn
upon
her
female
guest
.
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
 
and
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
prose
to
tell
of
the
fire
which
flashed
from
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
The
signora
stared
her
full
in
the
face
for
a
moment
,
and
then
turning
to
her
brother
said
playfully
,
"
Bertie
,
you
idiot
,
get
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
bishop
,
and
Mr.
Slope
,
and
her
three
daughters
were
around
her
,
and
had
collected
together
the
wide
ruins
of
her
magnificence
.
<EOS>
The
girls
fell
into
circular
rank
behind
their
mother
,
and
thus
following
her
and
carrying
out
the
fragments
,
they
left
the
reception
-
rooms
in
a
manner
not
altogether
devoid
of
dignity
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
had
to
retire
and
re
-
array
herself
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
constellation
had
swept
by
,
Ethelbert
rose
from
his
knees
and
,
turning
with
mock
anger
to
the
fat
rector
,
said
:
"
After
all
it
was
your
doing
,
sir
 
not
mine
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
you
are
waiting
for
preferment
,
and
so
I
bore
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Whereupon
there
was
a
laugh
against
the
fat
rector
,
in
which
both
the
bishop
and
the
chaplain
joined
,
and
thus
things
got
themselves
again
into
order
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
lord
,
I
am
so
sorry
for
this
accident
,
"
said
the
signora
,
putting
out
her
hand
so
as
to
force
the
bishop
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
My
brother
is
so
thoughtless
.
<EOS>
Pray
sit
down
,
and
let
me
have
the
pleasure
of
making
your
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Though
I
am
so
poor
a
creature
as
to
want
a
sofa
,
I
am
not
so
selfish
as
to
require
it
all
.
"
<EOS>
Madeline
could
always
dispose
herself
so
as
to
make
room
for
a
gentleman
,
though
,
as
she
declared
,
the
crinoline
of
her
lady
friends
was
much
too
bulky
to
be
so
accommodated
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
solely
for
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
that
I
have
had
myself
dragged
here
,
"
she
continued
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
with
your
occupation
,
one
can
not
even
hope
that
you
should
have
time
to
come
to
us
,
that
is
,
in
the
way
of
calling
.
<EOS>
And
at
your
English
dinner
-
parties
all
is
so
dull
and
so
stately
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
my
lord
,
that
in
coming
to
England
my
only
consolation
has
been
the
thought
that
I
should
know
you
;
"
and
she
looked
at
him
with
the
look
of
a
she
-
devil
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
,
however
,
thought
that
she
looked
very
like
an
angel
and
,
accepting
the
proffered
seat
,
sat
down
beside
her
.
<EOS>
He
uttered
some
platitude
as
to
his
deep
obligation
for
the
trouble
she
had
taken
,
and
wondered
more
and
more
who
she
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
know
my
sad
story
?
<EOS>
"
she
continued
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
did
n't
know
a
word
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
knew
,
however
,
or
thought
he
knew
,
that
she
could
n't
walk
into
a
room
like
other
people
,
and
so
made
the
most
of
that
.
<EOS>
He
put
on
a
look
of
ineffable
distress
and
said
that
he
was
aware
how
God
had
afflicted
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
signora
just
touched
the
corner
of
her
eyes
with
the
most
lovely
of
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
she
said
 
she
had
been
sorely
tried
 
tried
,
she
thought
,
beyond
the
common
endurance
of
humanity
;
but
while
her
child
was
left
to
her
,
everything
was
left
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
lord
,
"
she
exclaimed
,
"
you
must
see
that
infant
 
<EOS>
the
last
bud
of
a
wondrous
tree
<EOS>
:
you
must
let
a
mother
hope
that
you
will
lay
your
holy
hands
on
her
innocent
head
and
consecrate
her
for
female
virtues
.
<EOS>
May
I
hope
it
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
looking
into
the
bishop
's
eye
and
touching
the
bishop
's
arm
with
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
was
but
a
man
and
said
she
might
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
what
was
it
but
a
request
that
he
would
confirm
her
daughter
?
 
<EOS>
a
request
,
indeed
,
very
unnecessary
to
make
,
as
he
should
do
so
as
a
matter
of
course
if
the
young
lady
came
forward
in
the
usual
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
blood
of
Tiberius
,
"
said
the
signora
in
all
but
a
whisper
;
"
the
blood
of
Tiberius
flows
in
her
veins
.
<EOS>
She
is
the
last
of
the
Neros
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
had
heard
of
the
last
of
the
Visigoths
,
and
had
floating
in
his
brain
some
indistinct
idea
of
the
last
of
the
Mohicans
,
but
to
have
the
last
of
the
Neros
thus
brought
before
him
for
a
blessing
was
very
staggering
.
<EOS>
Still
he
liked
the
lady
:
she
had
a
proper
way
of
thinking
and
talked
with
more
propriety
than
her
brother
.
<EOS>
But
who
were
they
?
<EOS>
It
was
now
quite
clear
that
that
blue
madman
with
the
silky
beard
was
not
a
Prince
Vicinironi
.
<EOS>
The
lady
was
married
and
was
of
course
one
of
the
Vicinironi
's
by
right
of
the
husband
.
<EOS>
So
the
bishop
went
on
learning
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
will
you
see
her
?
<EOS>
said
the
signora
with
a
start
.
  
<EOS>
"
See
whom
?
"
said
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
child
,
"
said
the
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
young
lady
's
age
?
"
asked
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
just
seven
,
"
said
the
signora
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
said
the
bishop
,
shaking
his
head
;
"
she
is
much
too
young
 
very
much
too
young
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
in
sunny
Italy
,
you
know
,
we
do
not
count
by
years
,
"
and
the
signora
gave
the
bishop
one
of
her
very
sweetest
smiles
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
indeed
,
she
is
a
great
deal
too
young
,
"
persisted
the
bishop
;
"
we
never
confirm
before
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
you
might
speak
to
her
;
you
might
let
her
hear
from
your
consecrated
lips
that
she
is
not
a
castaway
because
she
is
a
Roman
;
that
she
may
be
a
Nero
and
yet
a
Christian
;
that
she
may
owe
her
black
locks
and
dark
cheeks
to
the
blood
of
the
pagan
Caesars
,
and
yet
herself
be
a
child
of
grace
;
you
will
tell
her
this
,
wo
n't
you
,
my
friend
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
friend
said
he
would
,
and
asked
if
the
child
could
say
her
catechism
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
signora
,
"
I
would
not
allow
her
to
learn
lessons
such
as
those
in
a
land
ridden
over
by
priests
and
polluted
by
the
idolatry
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
It
is
here
,
here
in
Barchester
,
that
she
must
first
be
taught
to
lisp
those
holy
words
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
you
could
be
her
instructor
!
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
Dr.
Proudie
certainly
liked
the
lady
,
but
,
seeing
that
he
was
a
bishop
,
it
was
not
probable
that
he
was
going
to
instruct
a
little
girl
in
the
first
rudiments
of
her
catechism
;
so
he
said
he
'd
send
a
teacher
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
'll
see
her
yourself
,
my
lord
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
said
he
would
,
but
where
should
he
call
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
Papa
's
house
,
"
said
the
Signora
with
an
air
of
some
little
surprise
at
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
actually
wanted
the
courage
to
ask
her
who
was
her
papa
,
so
he
was
forced
at
last
to
leave
her
without
fathoming
the
mystery
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
,
in
her
second
best
,
had
now
returned
to
the
rooms
,
and
her
husband
thought
it
as
well
that
he
should
not
remain
in
too
close
conversation
with
the
lady
whom
his
wife
appeared
to
hold
in
such
slight
esteem
.
<EOS>
Presently
he
came
across
his
youngest
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Netta
,
"
said
he
,
"
<EOS>
do
you
know
who
is
the
father
of
that
Signora
Vicinironi
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
Vicinironi
,
Papa
,
"
said
Netta
;
"
but
Vesey
Neroni
,
and
<EOS>
she
's
Doctor
Stanhope
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
go
and
do
the
civil
to
Griselda
Grantly
;
I
declare
nobody
has
spoken
a
word
to
the
poor
girl
this
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Stanhope
!
<EOS>
Dr.
Vesey
Stanhope
!
<EOS>
Dr.
Vesey
Stanhope
's
daughter
,
of
whose
marriage
with
a
dissolute
Italian
scamp
he
now
remembered
to
have
heard
something
!
<EOS>
And
that
impertinent
blue
cub
who
had
examined
him
as
to
his
episcopal
bearings
was
old
Stanhope
's
son
,
and
the
lady
who
had
entreated
him
to
come
and
teach
her
child
<EOS>
the
catechism
was
old
Stanhope
's
daughter
!
<EOS>
The
daughter
of
one
of
his
own
prebendaries
!
<EOS>
As
these
things
flashed
across
his
mind
,
he
was
nearly
as
angry
as
his
wife
had
been
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
could
not
but
own
that
the
mother
of
the
last
of
the
Neros
was
an
agreeable
woman
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
tripped
out
into
the
adjoining
room
,
in
which
were
congregated
a
crowd
of
Grantlyite
clergymen
,
among
whom
the
archdeacon
was
standing
pre
-
eminent
,
while
the
old
dean
was
sitting
nearly
buried
in
a
huge
arm
chair
by
the
fire
-
place
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
was
very
anxious
to
be
gracious
,
and
,
if
possible
,
to
diminish
the
bitterness
which
his
chaplain
had
occasioned
.
<EOS>
Let
Mr.
Slope
do
the
_
fortiter
in
re
_
,
he
himself
would
pour
in
the
_
suaviter
in
modo
_
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
stir
,
Mr.
Dean
,
pray
do
n't
stir
,
"
he
said
as
the
old
man
essayed
to
get
up
;
"
I
take
it
as
a
great
kindness
,
your
coming
to
such
an
_
omnium
gatherum
_
as
this
.
<EOS>
But
we
have
hardly
got
settled
yet
,
and
Mrs.
Proudie
has
not
been
able
to
see
her
friends
as
she
would
wish
to
do
.
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr.
Archdeacon
,
after
all
,
we
have
not
been
so
hard
upon
you
at
Oxford
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
"
you
've
only
drawn
our
teeth
and
cut
out
our
tongues
;
you
've
allowed
us
still
to
breathe
and
swallow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
laughed
the
bishop
;
"
it
's
not
quite
so
easy
to
cut
out
the
tongue
of
an
Oxford
magnate
 
and
as
for
teeth
 
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
Why
,
in
the
way
we
've
left
the
matter
,
it
's
very
odd
if
the
heads
of
colleges
do
n't
have
their
own
way
quite
as
fully
as
when
the
hebdomadal
board
was
in
all
its
glory
;
what
do
you
say
,
Mr.
Dean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
An
old
man
,
my
lord
,
never
likes
changes
,
"
said
the
dean
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
been
sad
bunglers
if
it
is
so
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
;
"
and
indeed
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
think
you
have
bungled
it
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
you
must
own
this
;
you
have
not
done
the
half
what
you
boasted
you
would
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
as
regards
your
system
of
professors
 
"
began
the
chancellor
slowly
.
<EOS>
He
was
never
destined
to
get
beyond
such
beginning
.
  
<EOS>
"
Talking
of
professors
,
"
said
a
soft
clear
voice
,
close
behind
the
chancellor
's
elbow
;
"
how
much
you
Englishmen
might
learn
from
Germany
;
only
you
are
all
too
proud
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
,
looking
round
,
perceived
that
that
abominable
young
Stanhope
had
pursued
him
.
<EOS>
The
dean
stared
at
him
as
though
he
were
some
unearthly
apparition
;
so
also
did
two
or
three
prebendaries
and
minor
canons
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
laughed
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
German
professors
are
men
of
learning
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
,
"
but
 
"
  
"
German
professors
!
<EOS>
"
groaned
out
the
chancellor
,
as
though
his
nervous
system
had
received
a
shock
which
nothing
but
a
week
of
Oxford
air
could
cure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
continued
Ethelbert
,
not
at
all
understanding
why
a
German
professor
should
be
contemptible
in
the
eyes
of
an
Oxford
don
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
but
what
the
name
is
best
earned
at
Oxford
.
<EOS>
In
Germany
the
professors
do
teach
;
at
Oxford
,
I
believe
,
they
only
profess
to
do
so
,
and
sometimes
not
even
that
.
<EOS>
You
'll
have
those
universities
of
yours
about
your
ears
soon
,
if
you
do
n't
consent
to
take
a
lesson
from
Germany
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
answering
this
.
<EOS>
Dignified
clergymen
of
sixty
years
of
age
could
not
condescend
to
discuss
such
a
matter
with
a
young
man
with
such
clothes
and
such
a
beard
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
got
good
water
out
at
Plumstead
,
Mr.
Archdeacon
?
"
said
the
bishop
by
way
of
changing
the
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
good
,
"
said
Dr.
Grantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
by
no
means
so
good
as
his
wine
,
my
lord
,
"
said
a
witty
minor
canon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
so
generally
used
,
"
said
another
;
"
<EOS>
that
is
,
for
inward
application
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
laughed
the
bishop
,
"
a
good
cellar
of
wine
is
a
very
comfortable
thing
in
a
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Your
German
professors
,
Sir
,
prefer
beer
,
I
believe
,
"
said
the
sarcastic
little
meagre
prebendary
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
do
n't
think
much
of
either
,
"
said
Ethelbert
,
"
and
that
perhaps
accounts
for
their
superiority
.
<EOS>
Now
the
Jewish
professor
 
"
  
The
insult
was
becoming
too
deep
for
the
spirit
of
Oxford
to
endure
,
so
the
archdeacon
walked
off
one
way
and
the
chancellor
another
,
followed
by
their
disciples
,
and
the
bishop
and
the
young
reformer
were
left
together
on
the
hearth
-
rug
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
a
Jew
once
myself
,
"
began
Bertie
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
was
determined
not
to
stand
another
examination
,
or
be
led
on
any
terms
into
Palestine
,
so
he
again
remembered
that
he
had
to
do
something
very
particular
,
and
left
young
Stanhope
with
the
dean
.
<EOS>
The
dean
did
not
get
the
worst
of
it
for
Ethelbert
<EOS>
gave
him
a
true
account
of
his
remarkable
doings
in
the
Holy

"
Oh
,
Mr.
Harding
,
"
said
the
bishop
,
overtaking
the
_
ci
-
devant
_
warden
;
"
I
wanted
to
say
one
word
about
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
of
course
,
that
it
is
to
be
filled
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
's
heart
beat
a
little
,
and
he
said
that
he
had
heard
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
continued
the
bishop
;
"
there
can
be
only
one
man
whom
I
could
wish
to
see
in
that
situation
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
your
own
views
may
be
,
Mr.
Harding
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
They
are
very
simply
told
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
other
;
"
to
take
the
place
if
it
be
offered
me
,
and
to
put
up
with
the
want
of
it
should
another
man
get
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
professed
himself
delighted
to
hear
it
;
Mr.
Harding
might
be
quite
sure
that
no
other
man
would
get
it
.
<EOS>
There
were
some
few
circumstances
which
would
in
a
slight
degree
change
the
nature
of
the
duties
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
was
probably
aware
of
this
,
and
would
,
perhaps
,
not
object
to
discuss
the
matter
with
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
subject
to
which
Mr.
Slope
had
given
a
good
deal
of
attention
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
felt
,
he
knew
not
why
,
oppressed
and
annoyed
.
<EOS>
What
could
Mr.
Slope
do
to
him
?
<EOS>
He
knew
that
there
were
to
be
changes
.
<EOS>
The
nature
of
them
must
be
communicated
to
the
warden
through
somebody
,
and
through
whom
so
naturally
as
the
bishop
's
chaplain
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twas
thus
he
tried
to
argue
himself
back
to
an
easy
mind
,
but
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
in
the
meantime
had
taken
the
seat
which
the
bishop
had
vacated
on
the
signora
's
sofa
,
and
remained
with
that
lady
till
it
was
time
to
marshal
the
folk
to
supper
.
<EOS>
Not
with
contented
eyes
had
Mrs.
Proudie
seen
this
.
<EOS>
Had
not
this
woman
laughed
at
her
distress
,
and
had
not
Mr.
Slope
heard
it
?
<EOS>
Was
she
not
an
intriguing
Italian
woman
,
half
wife
and
half
not
,
full
of
affectation
,
airs
,
and
impudence
?
<EOS>
Was
she
not
horribly
bedizened
with
velvet
and
pearls
,
with
velvet
and
pearls
,
too
,
which
had
not
been
torn
off
her
back
?
<EOS>
Above
all
,
did
she
not
pretend
to
be
more
beautiful
than
her
neighbours
?
<EOS>
To
say
that
Mrs.
Proudie
was
jealous
would
give
a
wrong
idea
of
her
feelings
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
the
slightest
desire
that
Mr.
Slope
should
be
in
love
with
herself
.
<EOS>
But
she
desired
the
incense
of
Mr.
Slope
's
spiritual
and
temporal
services
,
and
did
not
choose
that
they
should
be
turned
out
of
their
course
to
such
an
object
as
Signora
Neroni
.
<EOS>
She
considered
also
that
Mr.
Slope
ought
in
duty
to
hate
the
signora
,
and
it
appeared
from
his
manner
that
he
was
very
far
from
hating
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Mr.
Slope
,
"
she
said
,
sweeping
by
and
looking
all
that
she
felt
,
"
ca
n't
you
make
yourself
useful
?
<EOS>
Do
pray
take
Mrs.
Grantly
down
to
supper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
heard
and
escaped
.
<EOS>
The
words
were
hardly
out
of
Mrs.
Proudie
's
mouth
before
the
intended
victim
had
stuck
her
hand
through
the
arm
of
one
of
her
husband
's
curates
and
saved
herself
.
<EOS>
What
would
the
archdeacon
have
said
had
he
seen
her
walking
downstairs
with
Mr.
Slope
?
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
heard
also
,
but
was
by
no
means
<EOS>
so
obedient
as
was
expected
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
period
of
Mr.
Slope
's
obedience
to
Mrs.
Proudie
was
drawing
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
wish
yet
to
break
with
her
,
nor
to
break
with
her
at
all
,
if
it
could
be
avoided
.
<EOS>
But
he
intended
to
be
master
in
that
palace
,
and
as
she
had
made
the
same
resolution
it
was
not
improbable
that
they
might
come
to
blows
.
  
<EOS>
Before
leaving
the
signora
he
arranged
a
little
table
before
her
and
begged
to
know
what
he
should
bring
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
indifferent
,
she
said
 
nothing
 
anything
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
she
felt
the
misery
of
her
position
,
now
that
she
must
be
left
alone
.
<EOS>
Well
,
a
little
chicken
,
some
ham
,
and
a
glass
of
champagne
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
to
explain
,
not
without
blushing
for
his
patron
,
that
there
was
no
champagne
.
  
<EOS>
Sherry
would
do
just
as
well
.
<EOS>
And
then
Mr.
Slope
descended
with
the
learned
Miss
Trefoil
on
his
arm
.
<EOS>
Could
she
tell
him
,
he
asked
,
whether
the
ferns
of
Barsetshire
were
equal
to
those
of
Cumberland
?
<EOS>
His
strongest
worldly
passion
was
for
ferns
 
<EOS>
and
before
she
could
answer
him
<EOS>
he
left
her
wedged
between
the
door
and
the
sideboard
.
<EOS>
It
was
fifty
minutes
before
she
escaped
,
and
even
then
unfed
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
leaving
us
,
Mr.
Slope
,
"
said
the
watchful
lady
of
the
house
,
seeing
her
slave
escaping
towards
the
door
,
with
stores
of
provisions
held
high
above
the
heads
of
the
guests
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
explained
that
the
Signora
Neroni
was
in
want
of
her
supper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
Mr.
Slope
,
let
her
brother
take
it
to
her
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
,
quite
out
loud
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
out
of
the
question
that
you
should
be
so
employed
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
Mr.
Slope
,
oblige
me
<EOS>
;
I
am
sure
Mr.
Stanhope
will
wait
upon
his
sister
.
"
  
<EOS>
Ethelbert
was
most
agreeably
occupied
in
the
furthest
corner
of
the
room
,
making
himself
both
useful
and
agreeable
to
Mrs.
Proudie
's
youngest
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
get
out
,
madam
,
if
Madeline
were
starving
for
her
supper
,
"
said
he
;
"
I
'm
physically
fixed
,
unless
I
could
fly
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
lady
's
anger
was
increased
by
seeing
that
her
daughter
also
had
gone
over
to
the
enemy
,
and
when
she
saw
,
that
in
spite
of
her
remonstrances
,
in
the
teeth
of
her
positive
orders
,
Mr.
Slope
went
off
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
the
cup
of
her
indignation
ran
over
,
and
she
could
not
restrain
herself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
manners
I
never
saw
,
"
she
said
,
muttering
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
and
will
not
permit
it
;
"
and
then
,
after
fussing
and
fuming
for
a
few
minutes
,
she
pushed
her
way
through
the
crowd
and
followed
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
reached
the
room
above
,
she
found
it
absolutely
deserted
,
except
by
the
guilty
pair
.
<EOS>
The
signora
was
sitting
very
comfortably
up
to
her
supper
,
and
Mr.
Slope
was
leaning
over
her
and
administering
to
her
wants
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
discussing
the
merits
of
Sabbath
-
day
schools
,
and
the
lady
had
suggested
that
as
she
could
not
possibly
go
to
the
children
,
she
might
be
indulged
in
the
wish
of
her
heart
by
having
the
children
brought
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
shall
it
be
,
Mr.
Slope
?
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
was
saved
the
necessity
of
committing
himself
to
a
promise
by
the
entry
of
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
She
swept
close
up
to
the
sofa
so
as
to
confront
the
guilty
pair
,
stared
full
at
them
for
a
moment
,
and
then
said
,
as
she
passed
on
to
the
next
room
,
"
Mr.
Slope
,
his
lordship
is
especially
desirous
of
your
attendance
below
;
you
will
greatly
oblige
me
if
you
will
join
him
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
she
stalked
on
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
muttered
something
in
reply
,
and
prepared
to
go
downstairs
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
bishop
's
wanting
him
,
he
knew
his
lady
patroness
well
enough
to
take
that
assertion
at
what
it
was
worth
;
but
he
did
not
wish
to
make
himself
the
hero
of
a
scene
,
or
to
become
conspicuous
for
more
gallantry
than
the
occasion
required
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
always
like
this
?
"
said
the
signora
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
 
always
 
madam
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
,
returning
;
"
<EOS>
always
the
same
 
always
equally
adverse
to
impropriety
of
conduct
of
every
description
;
"
and
she
stalked
back
through
the
room
again
,
following
Mr.
Slope
out
of
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
The
signora
could
n't
follow
her
,
or
she
certainly
would
have
done
so
.
<EOS>
But
she
laughed
loud
,
and
sent
the
sound
of
it
ringing
through
the
lobby
and
down
the
stairs
after
Mrs.
Proudie
's
feet
.
<EOS>
Had
she
been
as
active
as
Grimaldi
<EOS>
,
she
could
probably
have
taken
no
better
revenge
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slope
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
,
catching
the
delinquent
at
the
door
<EOS>
,
"
I
am
surprised
you
should
leave
my
company
to
attend
on
such
a
painted
Jezebel
as
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
she
's
lame
,
Mrs.
Proudie
,
and
can
not
move
.
<EOS>
Somebody
must
have
waited
upon
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lame
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
;
"
I
'd
lame
her
if
she
belonged
to
me
.
<EOS>
What
business
had
she
here
at
all
?
 
<EOS>
such
impertinence
 
such
affectation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
hall
and
adjacent
rooms
all
manner
of
cloaking
and
shawling
was
going
on
,
and
the
Barchester
folk
were
getting
themselves
gone
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
did
her
best
to
smirk
at
each
and
every
one
as
they
made
their
adieux
,
but
she
was
hardly
successful
.
<EOS>
Her
temper
had
been
tried
fearfully
.
<EOS>
By
slow
degrees
the
guests
went
.
  
<EOS>
"
Send
back
the
carriage
quick
,
"
said
Ethelbert
,
as
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Stanhope
took
their
departure
.
  
<EOS>
The
younger
Stanhopes
were
left
to
the
very
last
,
and
an
uncomfortable
party
they
made
with
the
bishop
's
family
.
<EOS>
They
all
went
into
the
dining
-
room
,
and
then
the
bishop
observing
that
"
the
lady
"
was
alone
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
they
followed
him
up
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
kept
Mr.
Slope
and
her
daughters
in
close
conversation
,
resolving
that
he
should
not
be
indulged
,
nor
they
polluted
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
,
in
mortal
dread
of
Bertie
and
the
Jews
,
tried
to
converse
with
Charlotte
Stanhope
about
the
climate
of
Italy
.
<EOS>
Bertie
and
the
signora
had
no
resource
but
in
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
get
your
supper
at
last
,
Madeline
?
"
said
the
impudent
or
else
mischievous
young
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
said
Madeline
;
"
Mr.
Slope
was
so
very
kind
as
to
bring
it
me
.
<EOS>
I
fear
,
however
,
he
put
himself
to
more
inconvenience
than
I
wished
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
looked
at
her
but
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
meaning
of
her
look
might
have
been
thus
translated
;
"
If
ever
you
find
yourself
within
these
walls
again
,
I
'll
give
you
leave
to
be
as
impudent
and
affected
and
as
mischievous
as
you
please
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
last
the
carriage
returned
with
the
three
Italian
servants
,
and
La
Signora
Madeline
Vesey
Neroni
was
carried
out
,
as
she
had
been
carried
in
.
  
<EOS>
The
lady
of
the
palace
retired
to
her
chamber
by
no
means
contented
with
the
result
of
her
first
grand
party
at
Barchester
.
   
<EOS>
Slope
versus
Harding
 
<EOS>
Two
or
three
days
after
the
party
,
Mr.
Harding
received
a
note
begging
him
to
call
on
Mr.
Slope
,
at
the
palace
,
at
an
early
hour
on
the
following
morning
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
uncivil
in
the
communication
,
and
yet
the
tone
of
it
was
thoroughly
displeasing
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
follows
:
  
MY
DEAR
MR
.
<EOS>
HARDING
,
  
<EOS>
Will
you
favour
me
by
calling
on
me
at
the
palace
to
-
morrow
morning
at
9:30
A.M.
<EOS>
The
bishop
wishes
me
to
speak
to
you
touching
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
excuse
my
naming
so
early
an
hour
.
<EOS>
I
do
so
as
my
time
is
greatly
occupied
.
<EOS>
If
,
however
,
it
is
positively
inconvenient
to
you
,
I
will
change
it
to
10
.
<EOS>
You
will
,
perhaps
,
be
kind
enough
to
let
me
have
a
note
in
reply
.
  
<EOS>
Believe
me
to
be
,
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr.
Harding
,
Your
assured
friend
,
OBH
.
<EOS>
SLOPE
  
<EOS>
The
Palace
,
Monday
morning
,
20th
August
,
185
    
Mr.
Harding
neither
could
nor
would
believe
anything
of
the
sort
,
and
he
thought
,
moreover
,
that
Mr.
Slope
was
rather
impertinent
to
call
himself
by
such
a
name
.
<EOS>
His
assured
friend
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
How
many
assured
friends
generally
fall
to
the
lot
of
a
man
in
this
world
?
<EOS>
And
by
what
process
are
they
made
?
<EOS>
And
how
much
of
such
process
had
taken
place
as
yet
between
Mr.
Harding
and
Mr.
Slope
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
could
not
help
asking
himself
these
questions
as
he
read
and
re
-
read
the
note
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
answered
it
,
however
,
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
  
I
will
call
at
the
palace
to
-
morrow
at
9:30
A.M.
as
you
desire
.
  
<EOS>
Truly
yours
,
  
S.
HARDING
  
High
Street
,
Barchester
,
Monday
  
<EOS>
And
on
the
following
morning
,
punctually
at
half
-
past
nine
,
he
knocked
at
the
palace
door
and
asked
for
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
had
one
small
room
allotted
to
him
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
and
Mr.
Slope
had
another
.
<EOS>
Into
this
latter
Mr.
Harding
was
shown
and
asked
to
sit
down
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
was
not
yet
there
.
<EOS>
The
ex
-
warden
stood
up
at
the
window
looking
into
the
garden
,
and
could
not
help
thinking
how
very
short
a
time
had
passed
since
the
whole
of
that
house
had
been
open
to
him
,
as
though
he
had
been
a
child
of
the
family
,
born
and
bred
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
remembered
how
the
old
servants
used
to
smile
as
they
opened
the
door
to
him
;
how
the
familiar
butler
would
say
,
when
he
had
been
absent
a
few
hours
longer
than
usual
,
"
A
sight
of
you
,
Mr.
Harding
,
is
good
for
sore
eyes
;
"
how
the
fussy
housekeeper
would
swear
that
he
could
n't
have
dined
,
or
could
n't
have
breakfasted
,
or
could
n't
have
lunched
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
above
all
,
he
remembered
the
pleasant
gleam
of
inward
satisfaction
which
always
spread
itself
over
the
old
bishop
's
face
whenever
his
friend
entered
his
room
.
  
<EOS>
A
tear
came
into
each
eye
as
he
reflected
that
all
this
was
gone
.
<EOS>
What
use
would
the
hospital
be
to
him
now
?
<EOS>
He
was
alone
in
the
world
,
and
getting
old
;
he
would
soon
,
very
soon
have
to
go
and
leave
it
all
,
as
his
dear
old
friend
had
gone
;
go
,
and
leave
the
hospital
,
and
his
accustomed
place
in
the
cathedral
,
and
his
haunts
and
pleasures
,
to
younger
and
perhaps
wiser
men
.
<EOS>
That
chanting
of
his
!
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
in
truth
,
the
time
for
it
was
gone
by
.
<EOS>
He
felt
as
though
the
world
were
sinking
from
his
feet
;
as
though
this
,
this
was
the
time
for
him
to
turn
with
confidence
to
those
hopes
which
he
had
preached
with
confidence
to
others
.
<EOS>
"
What
,
"
said
he
to
himself
,
"
can
a
man
's
religion
be
worth
if
it
does
not
support
him
against
the
natural
melancholy
of
declining
years
?
"
<EOS>
And
as
he
looked
out
through
his
dimmed
eyes
into
the
bright
parterres
of
the
bishop
's
garden
,
he
felt
that
he
had
the
support
which
he
wanted
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
did
not
like
to
be
thus
kept
waiting
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Slope
did
not
really
wish
to
see
him
at
half
-
past
nine
o'clock
,
why
force
him
to
come
away
from
his
lodgings
with
his
breakfast
in
his
throat
?
<EOS>
To
tell
the
truth
,
it
was
policy
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
made
up
his
mind
that
Mr.
Harding
should
either
accept
the
hospital
with
abject
submission
,
or
else
refuse
it
altogether
,
and
had
calculated
that
he
would
probably
be
more
quick
to
do
the
latter
,
if
he
could
be
got
to
enter
upon
the
subject
in
an
ill
-
humour
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
Mr.
Slope
was
not
altogether
wrong
in
his
calculation
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
nearly
ten
when
Mr.
Slope
hurried
into
the
room
and
,
muttering
something
about
the
bishop
and
diocesan
duties
,
shook
Mr.
Harding
's
hand
ruthlessly
and
begged
him
to
be
seated
.
  
<EOS>
Now
the
air
of
superiority
which
this
man
assumed
did
go
against
the
grain
with
Mr.
Harding
,
and
yet
he
did
not
know
how
to
resent
it
.
<EOS>
The
whole
tendency
of
his
mind
and
disposition
was
opposed
to
any
contra
-
assumption
of
grandeur
on
his
own
part
,
and
he
had
n't
the
worldly
spirit
or
quickness
necessary
to
put
down
insolent
pretensions
by
downright
and
open
rebuke
,
as
the
archdeacon
would
have
done
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
for
Mr.
Harding
but
to
submit
,
and
he
accordingly
did
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
About
the
hospital
,
Mr.
Harding
?
"
began
Mr.
Slope
,
speaking
of
it
as
the
head
of
a
college
at
Cambridge
might
speak
of
some
sizarship
which
had
to
be
disposed
of
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
crossed
one
leg
over
another
,
and
then
one
hand
over
the
other
on
the
top
of
them
,
and
looked
Mr.
Slope
in
the
face
;
but
he
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
to
be
filled
up
again
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
said
that
he
had
understood
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
you
know
,
the
income
will
be
very
much
reduced
,
"
continued
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
The
bishop
wished
to
be
liberal
,
and
he
therefore
told
the
government
that
he
thought
it
ought
to
be
put
at
not
less
than
£
450
.
<EOS>
I
think
on
the
whole
the
bishop
was
right
,
for
though
the
services
required
will
not
be
of
a
very
onerous
nature
,
they
will
be
more
so
than
they
were
before
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
,
perhaps
,
well
that
the
clergy
immediately
attached
to
the
cathedral
town
should
be
made
as
comfortable
as
the
extent
of
the
ecclesiastical
means
at
our
disposal
will
allow
.
<EOS>
Those
are
the
bishop
's
ideas
,
and
I
must
say
mine
also
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
sat
rubbing
one
hand
on
the
other
,
but
said
not
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
much
for
the
income
,
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
The
house
will
,
of
course
,
remain
to
the
warden
,
as
before
.
<EOS>
It
should
,
however
,
I
think
,
be
stipulated
that
he
should
paint
inside
every
seven
years
,
and
outside
every
three
years
,
and
be
subject
to
dilapidations
,
in
the
event
of
vacating
,
either
by
death
or
otherwise
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
a
matter
on
which
the
bishop
must
yet
be
consulted
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
still
rubbed
his
hands
and
still
sat
silent
,
gazing
up
into
Mr.
Slope
's
unprepossessing
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
as
to
the
duties
,
"
continued
he
,
"
I
believe
,
if
I
am
rightly
informed
,
there
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
been
any
duties
hitherto
,
"
and
he
gave
a
sort
of
half
-
laugh
,
as
though
to
pass
off
the
accusation
in
the
guise
of
a
pleasantry
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
thought
of
the
happy
,
easy
years
he
had
passed
in
his
old
home
;
of
the
worn
-
out
,
aged
men
whom
he
had
succoured
;
of
his
good
intentions
;
and
of
his
work
,
which
had
certainly
been
of
the
lightest
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
these
things
,
doubting
for
a
moment
whether
he
did
or
did
not
deserve
the
sarcasm
.
<EOS>
He
gave
his
enemy
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
,
and
did
not
rebuke
him
.
<EOS>
He
merely
observed
,
very
tranquilly
,
and
perhaps
with
too
much
humility
,
that
the
duties
of
the
situation
,
such
as
they
were
,
had
,
he
believed
,
been
done
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
late
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
again
smiled
,
and
this
time
the
smile
was
intended
to
operate
against
the
memory
of
the
late
bishop
rather
than
against
the
energy
of
the
ex
-
warden
;
so
it
was
understood
by
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
The
colour
rose
to
his
cheeks
,
and
he
began
to
feel
very
angry
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
aware
,
Mr.
Harding
,
that
things
are
a
good
deal
changed
in
Barchester
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
said
that
he
was
aware
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
not
only
in
Barchester
,
Mr.
Harding
,
but
in
the
world
at
large
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
only
in
Barchester
that
a
new
man
is
carrying
out
new
measures
and
casting
away
the
useless
rubbish
of
past
centuries
.
<EOS>
The
same
thing
is
going
on
throughout
the
country
.
<EOS>
Work
is
now
required
from
every
man
who
receives
wages
,
and
they
who
have
to
superintend
the
doing
of
work
,
and
the
paying
of
wages
,
are
bound
to
see
that
this
rule
is
carried
out
.
<EOS>
New
men
,
Mr.
Harding
,
are
now
needed
and
are
now
forthcoming
in
the
church
,
as
well
as
in
other
professions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
All
this
was
wormwood
to
our
old
friend
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
rated
very
high
his
own
abilities
or
activity
,
but
all
the
feelings
of
his
heart
were
with
the
old
clergy
,
and
any
antipathies
of
which
his
heart
was
susceptible
were
directed
against
those
new
,
busy
,
uncharitable
,
self
-
lauding
men
,
of
whom
Mr.
Slope
was
so
good
an
example
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
said
he
,
"
the
bishop
will
prefer
a
new
man
at
the
hospital
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
no
means
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
The
bishop
is
very
anxious
that
you
should
accept
the
appointment
,
but
he
wishes
you
should
understand
beforehand
what
will
be
the
required
duties
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
a
Sabbath
-
day
school
will
be
attached
to
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
For
the
old
men
?
"
asked
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr.
Harding
,
not
for
the
old
men
,
but
for
the
benefit
of
the
children
of
such
of
the
poor
of
Barchester
as
it
may
suit
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
will
expect
that
you
shall
attend
this
school
,
and
that
the
teachers
shall
be
under
your
inspection
and
care
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
slipped
his
topmost
hand
off
the
other
and
began
to
rub
the
calf
of
the
leg
which
was
supported
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
the
old
men
,
"
continued
Mr.
Slope
,
"
and
the
old
women
who
are
to
form
a
part
of
the
hospital
,
the
bishop
is
desirous
that
you
shall
have
morning
and
evening
service
on
the
premises
every
Sabbath
,
and
one
weekday
service
;
that
you
shall
preach
to
them
once
at
least
on
Sundays
;
and
that
the
whole
hospital
be
always
collected
for
morning
and
evening
prayer
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
thinks
that
this
will
render
it
unnecessary
that
any
separate
seats
in
the
cathedral
should
be
reserved
for
the
hospital
inmates
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
paused
,
but
Mr.
Harding
still
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
seats
for
the
women
;
on
the
whole
,
Mr.
Harding
,
I
may
as
well
say
at
once
,
that
for
people
of
that
class
the
cathedral
service
does
not
appear
to
me
the
most
useful
 
even
if
it
be
so
for
any
class
of
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
discuss
that
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
desirous
of
doing
so
;
at
least
,
not
at
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
however
,
you
fully
understand
the
bishop
's
wishes
about
the
new
establishment
of
the
hospital
;
and
if
,
as
I
do
not
doubt
,
I
shall
receive
from
you
an
assurance
that
you
accord
with
his
lordship
's
views
,
it
will
give
me
very
great
pleasure
to
be
the
bearer
from
his
lordship
to
you
of
the
presentation
to
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
I
disagree
with
his
lordship
's
views
?
"
asked
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
hope
you
do
not
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
I
do
?
"
again
asked
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
such
unfortunately
should
be
the
case
,
which
I
can
hardly
conceive
,
I
presume
your
own
feelings
will
dictate
to
you
the
propriety
of
declining
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
I
accept
the
appointment
and
yet
disagree
with
the
bishop
,
what
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
This
question
rather
bothered
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
that
he
had
talked
the
matter
over
with
the
bishop
and
had
received
a
sort
of
authority
for
suggesting
to
Mr.
Harding
the
propriety
of
a
Sunday
school
and
certain
hospital
services
,
but
he
had
no
authority
for
saying
that
these
propositions
were
to
be
made
peremptory
conditions
attached
to
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
's
idea
had
been
that
Mr.
Harding
would
of
course
consent
and
that
the
school
would
become
,
like
the
rest
of
those
new
establishments
in
the
city
,
under
the
control
of
his
wife
and
his
chaplain
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
's
idea
had
been
more
correct
.
<EOS>
He
intended
that
Mr.
Harding
should
refuse
the
situation
,
and
that
an
ally
of
his
own
should
get
it
,
but
he
had
not
conceived
the
possibility
of
Mr.
Harding
openly
accepting
the
appointment
and
as
openly
rejecting
the
conditions
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
,
I
presume
,
probable
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
you
will
accept
from
the
hands
of
the
bishop
a
piece
of
preferment
with
a
fixed
predetermination
to
disacknowledge
the
duties
attached
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
become
warden
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
,
"
and
neglect
my
duty
,
the
bishop
has
means
by
which
he
can
remedy
the
grievance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
expected
such
an
argument
from
you
,
or
I
may
say
the
suggestion
of
such
a
line
of
conduct
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
with
a
great
look
of
injured
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
did
I
expect
such
a
proposition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
glad
at
any
rate
to
know
what
answer
I
am
to
make
to
his
lordship
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
an
early
opportunity
of
seeing
his
lordship
myself
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
Such
an
arrangement
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
"
will
hardly
give
his
lordship
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
is
impossible
that
the
bishop
should
himself
see
every
clergyman
in
the
diocese
on
every
subject
of
patronage
that
may
arise
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
,
I
believe
,
did
see
you
on
the
matter
,
and
I
really
can
not
see
why
he
should
be
troubled
to
do
so
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
Mr.
Slope
,
how
long
I
have
been
officiating
as
a
clergyman
in
this
city
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
's
wish
was
now
nearly
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
had
become
angry
,
and
it
was
probable
that
he
might
commit
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
not
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
the
question
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
think
the
bishop
would
be
justified
in
allowing
you
to
regard
as
a
sinecure
a
situation
that
requires
an
active
,
man
merely
because
you
have
been
employed
for
many
years
in
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
might
induce
the
bishop
to
see
me
,
if
I
asked
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
shall
consult
my
friends
in
this
matter
,
Mr.
Slope
;
but
I
mean
to
be
guilty
of
no
subterfuge
 
<EOS>
you
may
tell
the
bishop
that
as
I
altogether
disagree
with
his
views
about
the
hospital
,
I
shall
decline
the
situation
if
I
find
that
any
such
conditions
are
attached
to
it
as
those
you
have
suggested
;
"
and
so
saying
,
Mr.
Harding
took
his
hat
and
went
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
was
contented
.
<EOS>
He
considered
himself
at
liberty
to
accept
Mr.
Harding
's
last
speech
as
an
absolute
refusal
of
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
At
least
,
he
so
represented
it
to
the
bishop
and
to
Mrs.
Proudie
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
very
surprising
,
"
said
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
;
"
you
little
know
how
determined
the
whole
set
of
them
are
to
withstand
your
authority
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
Mr.
Harding
was
so
anxious
for
it
,
"
said
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
"
if
he
can
hold
it
without
the
slightest
acknowledgement
of
your
lordship
's
jurisdiction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
out
of
the
question
,
"
said
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
imagine
it
to
be
quite
so
,
"
said
the
chaplain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
I
should
think
so
,
"
said
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
am
sorry
for
it
,
"
said
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
there
is
much
cause
for
sorrow
,
"
said
the
lady
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
is
a
much
more
deserving
man
,
more
in
need
of
it
,
and
one
who
will
make
himself
much
more
useful
in
the
close
neighbourhood
of
the
palace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
had
better
see
Quiverful
?
"
said
the
chaplain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
had
,
"
said
the
bishop

<EOS>
The
Rubbish
Cart
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
was
not
a
happy
man
as
he
walked
down
the
palace
pathway
and
stepped
out
into
the
close
.
<EOS>
His
preferment
and
pleasant
house
were
a
second
time
gone
from
him
,
but
that
he
could
endure
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
schooled
and
insulted
by
a
man
young
enough
to
be
his
son
,
but
that
he
could
put
up
with
.
<EOS>
He
could
even
draw
from
the
very
injuries
which
had
been
inflicted
on
him
some
of
that
consolation
which
we
may
believe
martyrs
always
receive
from
the
injustice
of
their
own
sufferings
,
and
which
is
generally
proportioned
in
its
strength
to
the
extent
of
cruelty
with
which
martyrs
are
treated
.
<EOS>
He
had
admitted
to
his
daughter
that
he
wanted
the
comfort
of
his
old
home
,
and
yet
he
could
have
returned
to
his
lodgings
in
the
High
Street
,
if
not
with
exaltation
,
at
least
with
satisfaction
,
had
that
been
all
.
<EOS>
But
the
venom
of
the
chaplain
's
harangue
had
worked
into
his
blood
,
and
sapped
the
life
of
his
sweet
contentment
.
  
<EOS>
"
New
men
are
carrying
out
new
measures
and
are
carting
away
the
useless
rubbish
of
past
centuries
!
"
<EOS>
What
cruel
words
these
had
been
;
and
how
often
are
they
now
used
with
all
the
heartless
cruelty
of
a
Slope
!
<EOS>
A
man
is
sufficiently
condemned
if
it
can
only
be
shown
that
either
in
politics
or
religion
he
does
not
belong
to
some
new
school
established
within
the
last
score
of
years
.
<EOS>
He
may
then
regard
himself
as
rubbish
and
expect
to
be
carted
away
.
<EOS>
A
man
is
nothing
now
unless
he
has
within
him
a
full
appreciation
of
the
new
era
,
an
era
in
which
it
would
seem
that
neither
honesty
nor
truth
is
very
desirable
,
but
in
which
success
is
the
only
touchstone
of
merit
.
<EOS>
We
must
laugh
at
everything
that
is
established
.
<EOS>
Let
the
joke
be
ever
so
bad
,
ever
so
untrue
to
the
real
principles
of
joking
;
nevertheless
we
must
laugh
 
or
else
beware
the
cart
.
<EOS>
We
must
talk
,
think
,
and
live
up
to
the
spirit
of
the
times
,
and
write
up
to
it
too
,
if
that
cacoethes
be
upon
us
,
or
else
we
are
nought
.
<EOS>
New
men
and
new
measures
,
long
credit
and
few
scruples
,
great
success
or
wonderful
ruin
,
such
are
now
the
tastes
of
Englishmen
who
know
how
to
live
.
<EOS>
Alas
,
alas
!
<EOS>
Under
such
circumstances
Mr.
Harding
could
not
but
feel
that
he
was
an
Englishman
who
did
not
know
how
to
live
.
<EOS>
This
new
doctrine
of
Mr.
Slope
and
the
rubbish
cart
,
new
at
least
at
Barchester
,
sadly
disturbed
his
equanimity
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
same
thing
is
going
on
throughout
the
whole
country
!
<EOS>
Work
is
now
required
from
every
man
who
receives
wages
!
"
<EOS>
And
had
he
been
living
all
his
life
receiving
wages
and
doing
no
work
?
<EOS>
Had
he
in
truth
so
lived
as
to
be
now
in
his
old
age
justly
reckoned
as
rubbish
fit
only
to
be
hidden
away
in
some
huge
dust
-
hole
?
<EOS>
The
school
of
men
to
whom
he
professes
to
belong
,
the
Grantlys
,
the
Gwynnes
,
and
the
old
high
set
of
Oxford
divines
,
are
afflicted
with
no
such
self
-
accusations
as
these
which
troubled
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
They
,
as
a
rule
,
are
as
satisfied
with
the
wisdom
and
propriety
of
their
own
conduct
as
can
be
any
Mr.
Slope
,
or
any
Dr.
Proudie
,
with
his
own
.
<EOS>
But
unfortunately
for
himself
Mr.
Harding
had
little
of
this
self
-
reliance
.
<EOS>
When
he
heard
himself
designated
as
rubbish
by
the
Slopes
of
the
world
,
he
had
no
other
resource
than
to
make
inquiry
within
his
own
bosom
as
to
the
truth
of
the
designation
.
<EOS>
Alas
,
alas
!
<EOS>
The
evidence
seemed
generally
to
go
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
professed
to
himself
in
the
bishop
's
parlour
that
in
these
coming
sources
of
the
sorrow
of
age
,
in
these
fits
of
sad
regret
from
which
the
latter
years
of
few
reflecting
men
can
be
free
,
religion
would
suffice
to
comfort
him
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
religion
could
console
him
for
the
loss
of
any
worldly
good
,
but
was
his
religion
of
that
active
sort
which
would
enable
him
so
to
repent
of
misspent
years
as
to
pass
those
that
were
left
to
him
in
a
spirit
of
hope
for
the
future
?
<EOS>
And
such
repentance
itself
,
is
it
not
a
work
of
agony
and
of
tears
?
<EOS>
It
is
very
easy
to
talk
of
repentance
,
but
a
man
has
to
walk
over
hot
ploughshares
before
he
can
complete
it
;
to
be
skinned
alive
as
was
St.
Bartholomew
;
to
be
stuck
full
of
arrows
as
was
St.
Sebastian
;
to
lie
broiling
on
a
gridiron
like
St.
Lorenzo
!
<EOS>
How
if
his
past
life
required
such
repentance
as
this
?
<EOS>
Had
he
the
energy
to
go
through
with
it
?
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
,
after
leaving
the
palace
,
walked
slowly
for
an
hour
or
so
beneath
the
shady
elms
of
the
close
and
then
betook
himself
to
his
daughter
's
house
.
<EOS>
He
had
at
any
rate
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
go
out
to
Plumstead
to
consult
Dr.
Grantly
,
and
that
he
would
in
the
first
instance
tell
Eleanor
what
had
occurred
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
he
was
doomed
to
undergo
another
misery
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
forestalled
him
at
the
widow
's
house
.
<EOS>
He
had
called
there
on
the
preceding
afternoon
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
he
had
said
,
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
telling
Mrs.
Bold
that
her
father
was
about
to
return
to
the
pretty
house
at
Hiram
's
Hospital
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
instructed
by
the
bishop
to
inform
Mr.
Harding
that
the
appointment
would
now
be
made
at
once
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
was
of
course
only
too
happy
to
be
able
to
be
the
means
of
restoring
to
Mr.
Harding
the
preferment
which
he
had
so
long
adorned
.
<EOS>
And
then
by
degrees
Mr.
Slope
had
introduced
the
subject
of
the
pretty
school
which
he
hoped
before
long
to
see
attached
to
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
He
had
quite
fascinated
Mrs.
Bold
by
his
description
of
this
picturesque
,
useful
,
and
charitable
appendage
,
and
she
had
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
she
had
no
doubt
her
father
would
approve
,
and
that
she
herself
would
gladly
undertake
a
class
.
  
<EOS>
Anyone
who
had
heard
the
entirely
different
tone
and
seen
the
entirely
different
manner
in
which
Mr.
Slope
had
spoken
of
this
projected
institution
to
the
daughter
and
to
the
father
could
not
have
failed
to
own
that
Mr.
Slope
was
a
man
of
genius
.
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
to
Mrs.
Bold
about
the
hospital
sermons
and
services
,
nothing
about
the
exclusion
of
the
old
men
from
the
cathedral
,
nothing
about
dilapidation
and
painting
,
nothing
about
carting
away
the
rubbish
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
had
said
to
herself
that
certainly
she
did
not
like
Mr.
Slope
personally
,
but
that
he
was
a
very
active
,
zealous
clergyman
and
would
no
doubt
be
useful
in
Barchester
.
<EOS>
All
this
paved
the
way
for
much
additional
misery
to
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
put
on
her
happiest
face
as
she
heard
her
father
on
the
stairs
,
for
she
thought
she
had
only
to
congratulate
him
;
but
directly
she
saw
his
face
she
knew
that
there
was
but
little
matter
for
congratulation
.
<EOS>
She
had
seen
him
with
the
same
weary
look
of
sorrow
on
one
or
two
occasions
before
,
and
remembered
it
well
.
<EOS>
She
had
seen
him
when
he
first
read
that
attack
upon
himself
in
"
The
Jupiter
"
which
had
ultimately
caused
him
to
resign
the
hospital
,
and
she
had
seen
him
also
when
the
archdeacon
had
persuaded
him
to
remain
there
against
his
own
sense
of
propriety
and
honour
.
<EOS>
She
knew
at
a
glance
that
his
spirit
was
in
deep
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Papa
,
what
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
said
she
,
putting
down
her
boy
to
crawl
upon
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
came
to
tell
you
,
my
dear
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
I
am
going
out
to
Plumstead
<EOS>
:
you
wo
n't
come
with
me
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
Plumstead
,
Papa
?
<EOS>
Shall
you
stay
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
shall
,
to
-
night
:
I
must
consult
the
archdeacon
about
this
weary
hospital
.
<EOS>
Ah
me
!
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
never
thought
of
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Papa
,
what
is
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
with
Mr.
Slope
,
my
dear
,
and
he
is
n't
the
pleasantest
companion
in
the
world
,
at
least
not
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Eleanor
gave
a
sort
of
half
-
blush
,
but
she
was
wrong
if
she
imagined
that
her
father
in
any
way
alluded
to
her
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
wants
to
turn
the
hospital
into
a
Sunday
-
school
and
a
preaching
-
house
,
and
I
suppose
he
will
have
his
way
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
feel
myself
adapted
for
such
an
establishment
,
and
therefore
,
I
suppose
,
I
must
refuse
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
would
be
the
harm
of
the
school
,
Papa
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
want
of
a
proper
schoolmaster
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
that
would
of
course
be
supplied
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slope
wishes
to
supply
it
by
making
me
his
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
But
as
I
am
hardly
fit
for
such
work
,
I
intend
to
decline
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Papa
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
does
n't
intend
that
.
<EOS>
He
was
here
yesterday
,
and
what
he
intends
 
"
  
"
He
was
here
yesterday
,
was
he
?
"
asked
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Papa
.
"
  
"
And
talking
about
the
hospital
?
"
  
"
He
was
saying
how
glad
he
would
be
,
and
the
bishop
too
,
to
see
you
back
there
again
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
spoke
about
the
Sunday
-
school
;
and
to
tell
the
truth
I
agreed
with
him
;
and
I
thought
you
would
have
done
so
too
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
spoke
of
a
school
,
not
inside
the
hospital
,
but
just
connected
with
it
,
of
which
you
would
be
the
patron
and
visitor
;
and
I
thought
you
would
have
liked
such
a
school
as
that
;
and
I
promised
to
look
after
it
and
to
take
a
class
 
<EOS>
and
it
all
seemed
so
very
 
.
<EOS>
But
,
oh
,
Papa
!
<EOS>
I
shall
be
so
miserable
if
I
find
I
have
done
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
wrong
at
all
,
my
dear
,
"
said
he
gently
,
very
gently
rejecting
his
daughter
's
caress
.
<EOS>
"
There
can
be
nothing
wrong
in
your
wishing
to
make
yourself
useful
;
indeed
,
you
ought
to
do
so
by
all
means
.
<EOS>
Everyone
must
now
exert
himself
who
would
not
choose
to
go
to
the
wall
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Harding
thus
attempted
in
his
misery
to
preach
the
new
doctrine
to
his
child
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Himself
or
herself
,
it
's
all
the
same
,
"
he
continued
;
"
you
will
be
quite
right
,
my
dear
,
to
do
something
of
this
sort
;
but
 
"
  
"
Well
,
Papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
quite
sure
that
if
I
were
you
I
would
select
Mr.
Slope
for
my
guide
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
never
have
done
so
and
never
shall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
very
wicked
of
me
to
speak
evil
of
him
,
for
to
tell
the
truth
<EOS>
I
know
no
evil
of
him
;
but
I
am
not
quite
sure
that
he
is
honest
.
<EOS>
That
he
is
not
gentlemanlike
in
his
manners
,
of
that
I
am
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
thought
of
taking
him
for
my
guide
,
Papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
for
myself
,
my
dear
,
"
continued
he
,
"
we
know
the
old
proverb
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
bad
teaching
an
old
dog
tricks
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
decline
the
Sunday
-
school
,
and
shall
therefore
probably
decline
the
hospital
also
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
first
see
your
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
he
took
up
his
hat
,
kissed
the
baby
,
and
withdrew
,
leaving
Eleanor
in
as
low
spirits
as
himself
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
was
a
great
aggravation
to
his
misery
.
<EOS>
He
had
so
few
with
whom
to
sympathize
that
he
could
not
afford
to
be
cut
off
from
the
one
whose
sympathy
was
of
the
most
value
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
yet
it
seemed
probable
that
this
would
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
own
to
himself
that
he
wished
his
daughter
to
hate
Mr.
Slope
,
yet
had
she
expressed
such
a
feeling
there
would
have
been
very
little
bitterness
in
the
rebuke
he
would
have
given
her
for
so
uncharitable
a
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
The
fact
,
however
,
was
that
she
was
on
friendly
terms
with
Mr.
Slope
,
that
she
coincided
with
his
views
,
adhered
at
once
to
his
plans
,
and
listened
with
delight
to
his
teaching
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
hardly
wished
his
daughter
to
hate
the
man
,
but
he
would
have
preferred
that
to
her
loving
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
walked
away
to
the
inn
to
order
a
fly
,
went
home
to
put
up
his
carpet
-
bag
,
and
then
started
for
Plumstead
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
at
any
rate
,
no
danger
that
the
archdeacon
would
fraternize
with
Mr.
Slope
;
but
then
he
would
recommend
internecine
war
,
public
appeals
,
loud
reproaches
,
and
all
the
paraphernalia
of
open
battle
.
<EOS>
Now
that
alternative
was
hardly
more
to
Mr.
Harding
's
taste
than
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Harding
reached
the
parsonage
,
he
found
that
the
archdeacon
was
out
,
and
would
not
be
home
till
dinnertime
,
so
he
began
his
complaint
to
his
elder
daughter
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
entertained
quite
as
strong
an
antagonism
to
Mr.
Slope
as
did
her
husband
;
she
was
also
quite
as
alive
to
the
necessity
of
combating
the
Proudie
faction
,
of
supporting
the
old
church
interest
of
the
close
,
of
keeping
in
her
own
set
such
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
as
duly
belonged
to
it
;
and
was
quite
as
well
prepared
as
her
lord
to
carry
on
the
battle
without
giving
or
taking
quarter
.
<EOS>
Not
that
she
was
a
woman
prone
to
quarrelling
,
or
ill
-
inclined
to
live
at
peace
with
her
clerical
neighbours
;
but
she
felt
,
as
did
the
archdeacon
,
that
the
presence
of
Mr.
Slope
in
Barchester
was
an
insult
to
everyone
connected
with
the
late
bishop
,
and
that
his
assumed
dominion
in
the
diocese
was
a
spiritual
injury
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
people
had
little
guessed
how
bitter
Mrs.
Grantly
could
be
.
<EOS>
She
lived
on
the
best
of
terms
with
all
the
rectors
"
wives
around
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
popular
with
all
the
ladies
connected
with
the
close
.
<EOS>
Though
much
the
wealthiest
of
the
ecclesiastical
matrons
of
the
county
,
she
had
so
managed
her
affairs
that
her
carriage
and
horses
had
given
umbrage
to
none
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
thrown
herself
among
the
county
grandees
so
as
to
excite
the
envy
of
other
clergymen
's
wives
.
<EOS>
She
never
talked
too
loudly
of
earls
and
countesses
,
or
boasted
that
she
gave
her
governess
sixty
pounds
a
year
,
or
her
cook
seventy
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
had
lived
the
life
of
a
wise
,
discreet
,
peace
-
making
woman
,
and
the
people
of
Barchester
were
surprised
at
the
amount
of
military
vigour
she
displayed
as
general
of
the
feminine
Grantlyite
forces
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
soon
learned
that
her
sister
Eleanor
had
promised
to
assist
Mr.
Slope
in
the
affairs
of
the
hospital
school
,
and
it
was
on
this
point
that
her
attention
first
fixed
itself
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
Eleanor
endure
him
?
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
very
crafty
man
,
"
said
her
father
,
"
and
his
craft
has
been
successful
in
making
Eleanor
think
that
he
is
a
meek
,
charitable
,
good
clergyman
.
<EOS>
God
forgive
me
,
if
I
wrong
him
,
but
such
is
not
his
true
character
in
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
true
character
,
indeed
!
"
said
she
,
with
something
approaching
scorn
for
her
father
's
moderation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
only
hope
he
wo
n't
have
craft
enough
to
make
Eleanor
forget
herself
and
her
position
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
mean
marry
him
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
startled
out
of
his
usual
demeanour
by
the
abruptness
and
horror
of
so
dreadful
a
proposition
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
there
so
improbable
in
it
?
<EOS>
Of
course
that
would
be
his
own
object
if
he
thought
he
had
any
chance
of
success
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
has
a
thousand
a
year
entirely
at
her
own
disposal
,
and
what
better
fortune
could
fall
to
Mr.
Slope
's
lot
than
the
transferring
of
the
disposal
of
such
a
fortune
to
himself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
ca
n't
think
she
likes
him
,
Susan
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
said
Susan
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
n't
she
like
him
?
<EOS>
He
's
just
the
sort
of
man
to
get
on
with
a
woman
left
,
as
she
is
,
with
no
one
to
look
after
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
after
her
!
"
said
the
unhappy
father
;
"
do
n't
we
look
after
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Papa
,
how
innocent
you
are
!
<EOS>
Of
course
it
was
to
be
expected
that
Eleanor
should
marry
again
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
the
last
to
advise
her
against
it
,
if
she
would
only
wait
the
proper
time
,
and
then
marry
at
least
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
n't
really
mean
to
say
that
you
suppose
Eleanor
has
ever
thought
of
marrying
Mr.
Slope
?
<EOS>
Why
,
Mr.
Bold
has
only
been
dead
a
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eighteen
months
,
"
said
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
suppose
Eleanor
has
ever
thought
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
probable
,
though
,
that
he
has
;
and
that
he
will
try
and
make
her
do
so
;
and
that
he
will
succeed
too
,
if
we
do
n't
take
care
what
we
are
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
quite
a
new
phase
of
the
affair
to
poor
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
To
have
thrust
upon
him
as
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
as
the
husband
of
his
favourite
child
,
the
only
man
in
the
world
whom
he
really
positively
disliked
,
would
be
a
misfortune
which
he
felt
he
would
not
know
how
to
endure
patiently
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
could
there
be
any
ground
for
so
dreadful
a
surmise
?
<EOS>
In
all
worldly
matters
he
was
apt
to
look
upon
the
opinion
of
his
eldest
daughter
as
one
generally
sound
and
trustworthy
.
<EOS>
In
her
appreciation
of
character
,
of
motives
,
and
the
probable
conduct
both
of
men
and
women
,
she
was
usually
not
far
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
had
early
foreseen
the
marriage
of
Eleanor
and
John
Bold
;
she
had
at
a
glance
deciphered
the
character
of
the
new
bishop
and
his
chaplain
;
could
it
possibly
be
that
her
present
surmise
should
ever
come
forth
as
true
?
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
n't
think
that
she
likes
him
?
"
said
Mr.
Harding
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Papa
,
I
ca
n't
say
that
I
think
she
dislikes
him
as
she
ought
to
do
.
<EOS>
Why
is
he
visiting
there
as
a
confidential
friend
,
when
he
never
ought
to
have
been
admitted
inside
the
house
?
<EOS>
Why
is
it
that
she
speaks
to
him
about
your
welfare
and
your
position
,
as
she
clearly
has
done
?
<EOS>
At
the
bishop
's
party
the
other
night
I
saw
her
talking
to
him
for
half
an
hour
at
the
stretch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
Mr.
Slope
seemed
to
talk
to
nobody
there
but
that
daughter
of
Stanhope
's
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
,
wishing
to
defend
his
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Slope
is
a
cleverer
man
than
you
think
of
,
Papa
,
and
keeps
more
than
one
iron
in
the
fire
.
"
  
<EOS>
To
give
Eleanor
her
due
,
any
suspicion
as
to
the
slightest
inclination
on
her
part
towards
Mr.
Slope
was
a
wrong
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
more
idea
of
marrying
Mr.
Slope
than
she
had
of
marrying
the
bishop
,
and
the
idea
that
Mr.
Slope
would
present
himself
as
a
suitor
had
never
occurred
to
her
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
to
give
her
her
due
again
,
she
had
never
thought
about
suitors
since
her
husband
's
death
.
<EOS>
But
nevertheless
it
was
true
that
she
had
overcome
all
that
repugnance
to
the
man
which
was
so
strongly
felt
for
him
by
the
rest
of
the
Grantly
faction
.
<EOS>
She
had
forgiven
him
his
sermon
.
<EOS>
She
had
forgiven
him
his
Low
Church
tendencies
,
his
Sabbath
-
schools
,
and
puritanical
observances
.
<EOS>
She
had
forgiven
his
pharisaical
arrogance
,
and
even
his
greasy
face
and
oily
,
vulgar
manners
.
<EOS>
Having
agreed
to
overlook
such
offences
as
these
,
why
should
she
not
in
time
be
taught
to
regard
Mr.
Slope
as
a
suitor
?
  
<EOS>
And
as
to
him
,
it
must
also
be
affirmed
that
he
was
hitherto
equally
innocent
of
the
crime
imputed
to
him
.
<EOS>
How
it
had
come
to
pass
that
a
man
whose
eyes
were
generally
so
widely
open
to
everything
around
him
had
not
perceived
that
this
young
widow
was
rich
as
well
as
beautiful
,
can
not
probably
now
be
explained
.
<EOS>
But
such
was
the
fact
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
ingratiated
himself
with
Mrs.
Bold
,
merely
as
he
had
done
with
other
ladies
,
in
order
to
strengthen
his
party
in
the
city
.
<EOS>
He
subsequently
amended
his
error
,
but
it
was
not
till
after
the
interview
between
him
and
Mr.
Harding
.
   
<EOS>
The
New
Champion
 
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
did
not
return
to
the
parsonage
till
close
upon
the
hour
of
dinner
,
and
there
was
therefore
no
time
to
discuss
matters
before
that
important
ceremony
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
in
an
especial
good
humour
,
and
welcomed
his
father
-
in
-
law
with
a
sort
of
jovial
earnestness
that
was
usual
with
him
when
things
on
which
he
was
intent
were
going
on
as
he
would
have
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
settled
,
my
dear
,
"
said
he
to
his
wife
as
he
washed
his
hands
in
his
dressing
-
room
,
while
she
,
according
to
her
wo
nt
,
sat
listening
in
the
bedroom
;
"
Arabin
has
agreed
to
accept
the
living
.
<EOS>
He
'll
be
here
next
week
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
archdeacon
scrubbed
his
hands
and
rubbed
his
face
with
a
violent
alacrity
,
which
showed
that
Arabin
's
coming
was
a
great
point
gained
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
he
come
here
to
Plumstead
?
"
said
the
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
promised
to
stay
a
month
with
us
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
"
so
that
he
may
see
what
his
parish
is
like
.
<EOS>
You
'll
like
Arabin
very
much
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
gentleman
in
every
respect
,
and
full
of
humour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
very
queer
,
is
n't
he
?
"
asked
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
 
he
is
a
little
odd
in
some
of
his
fancies
,
but
there
's
nothing
about
him
you
wo
n't
like
.
<EOS>
He
is
as
staunch
a
churchman
as
there
is
at
Oxford
.
<EOS>
I
really
do
n't
know
what
we
should
do
without
Arabin
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
great
thing
for
me
to
have
him
so
near
me
,
and
if
anything
can
put
Slope
down
,
Arabin
will
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Reverend
Francis
Arabin
was
a
fellow
of
Lazarus
,
the
favoured
disciple
of
the
great
Dr.
Gwynne
,
a
High
Churchman
at
all
points
 
so
high
,
indeed
,
that
at
one
period
of
his
career
he
had
all
but
toppled
over
into
the
cesspool
of
Rome
 
a
poet
and
also
a
polemical
writer
,
a
great
pet
in
the
common
-
rooms
at
Oxford
,
an
eloquent
clergyman
,
a
droll
,
odd
,
humorous
,
energetic
,
conscientious
man
,
and
,
as
the
archdeacon
had
boasted
of
him
,
a
thorough
gentleman
.
<EOS>
As
he
will
hereafter
be
brought
more
closely
to
our
notice
,
it
is
now
only
necessary
to
add
that
he
had
just
been
presented
to
the
vicarage
of
St.
Ewold
by
Dr.
Grantly
,
in
whose
gift
as
archdeacon
the
living
lay
.
<EOS>
St.
Ewold
is
a
parish
lying
just
without
the
city
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
The
suburbs
of
the
new
town
,
indeed
,
are
partly
within
its
precincts
,
and
the
pretty
church
and
parsonage
are
not
much
above
a
mile
distant
from
the
city
gate
.
  
<EOS>
St.
Ewold
is
not
a
rich
piece
of
preferment
 
<EOS>
it
is
worth
some
three
or
four
hundred
a
year
at
most
,
and
has
generally
been
held
by
a
clergyman
attached
to
the
cathedral
choir
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
,
however
,
felt
,
when
the
living
on
this
occasion
became
vacant
,
that
it
imperatively
behoved
him
to
aid
the
force
of
his
party
with
some
tower
of
strength
,
if
any
such
tower
could
be
got
to
occupy
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
He
had
discussed
the
matter
with
his
brethren
in
Barchester
,
not
in
any
weak
spirit
as
the
holder
of
patronage
to
be
used
for
his
own
or
his
family
's
benefit
,
but
as
one
to
whom
was
committed
a
trust
on
the
due
administration
of
which
much
of
the
church
's
welfare
might
depend
.
<EOS>
He
had
submitted
to
them
the
name
of
Mr.
Arabin
,
as
though
the
choice
had
rested
with
them
all
in
conclave
,
and
they
had
unanimously
admitted
that
,
if
Mr.
Arabin
would
accept
St.
Ewold
's
,
no
better
choice
could
possibly
be
made
.
  
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Arabin
would
accept
St.
Ewold
's
!
<EOS>
There
lay
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
was
a
man
standing
somewhat
prominently
before
the
world
,
that
is
,
before
the
Church
of
England
world
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
rich
man
,
it
is
true
,
for
he
held
no
preferment
but
his
fellowship
;
but
he
was
a
man
not
over
-
anxious
for
riches
,
not
married
of
course
,
and
one
whose
time
was
greatly
taken
up
in
discussing
,
both
in
print
and
on
platforms
,
the
privileges
and
practices
of
the
church
to
which
he
belonged
.
<EOS>
As
the
archdeacon
had
done
battle
for
its
temporalities
,
so
did
Mr.
Arabin
do
battle
for
its
spiritualities
,
and
both
had
done
so
conscientiously
;
that
is
,
not
so
much
each
for
his
own
benefit
as
for
that
of
others
.
  
<EOS>
Holding
such
a
position
as
Mr.
Arabin
did
,
there
was
much
reason
to
doubt
whether
he
would
consent
to
become
the
parson
of
St.
Ewold
's
,
and
Dr.
Grantly
had
taken
the
trouble
to
go
himself
to
Oxford
on
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
and
Dr.
Grantly
together
had
succeeded
in
persuading
this
eminent
divine
that
duty
required
him
to
go
to
Barchester
.
<EOS>
There
were
wheels
within
wheels
in
this
affair
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
past
Mr.
Arabin
had
been
engaged
in
a
tremendous
controversy
with
no
less
a
person
than
Mr.
Slope
,
respecting
the
apostolic
succession
.
<EOS>
These
two
gentlemen
had
never
seen
each
other
,
but
they
had
been
extremely
bitter
in
print
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
endeavoured
to
strengthen
his
cause
by
calling
Mr.
Arabin
an
owl
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
had
retaliated
by
hinting
that
Mr.
Slope
was
an
infidel
.
<EOS>
This
battle
had
been
commenced
in
the
columns
of
"
The
Jupiter
,
"
a
powerful
newspaper
,
the
manager
of
which
was
very
friendly
to
Mr.
Slope
's
view
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
The
matter
,
however
,
had
become
too
tedious
for
the
readers
of
"
The
Jupiter
,
"
and
a
little
note
had
therefore
been
appended
to
one
of
Mr.
Slope
's
most
telling
rejoinders
,
in
which
it
had
been
stated
that
no
further
letters
from
the
reverend
gentlemen
could
be
inserted
except
as
advertisements
.
  
<EOS>
Other
methods
of
publication
were
,
however
,
found
,
less
expensive
than
advertisements
in
"
The
Jupiter
,
"
and
the
war
went
on
merrily
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
declared
that
the
main
part
of
the
consecration
of
a
clergyman
was
the
self
-
devotion
of
the
inner
man
to
the
duties
of
the
ministry
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
contended
that
a
man
was
not
consecrated
at
all
,
had
,
indeed
,
no
single
attribute
of
a
clergyman
,
unless
he
became
so
through
the
imposition
of
some
bishop
's
hands
,
who
had
become
a
bishop
through
the
imposition
of
other
hands
,
and
so
on
in
a
direct
line
to
one
of
the
apostles
.
<EOS>
Each
had
repeatedly
hung
the
other
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
,
but
neither
seemed
to
be
a
whit
the
worse
for
the
hanging
;
and
so
the
war
went
on
merrily
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
or
no
the
near
neighbourhood
of
the
foe
may
have
acted
in
any
way
as
an
inducement
to
Mr.
Arabin
to
accept
the
living
of
St.
Ewold
,
we
will
not
pretend
to
say
;
but
it
had
at
any
rate
been
settled
in
Dr.
Gwynne
's
library
,
at
Lazarus
,
that
he
would
accept
it
,
and
that
he
would
lend
his
assistance
towards
driving
the
enemy
out
of
Barchester
,
or
,
at
any
rate
,
silencing
him
while
he
remained
there
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
intended
to
keep
his
rooms
at
Oxford
and
to
have
the
assistance
of
a
curate
at
St.
Ewold
,
but
he
promised
to
give
as
much
time
as
possible
to
the
neighbourhood
of
Barchester
,
and
from
so
great
a
man
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
was
quite
satisfied
with
such
a
promise
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
small
part
of
the
satisfaction
derivable
from
such
an
arrangement
that
Bishop
Proudie
would
be
forced
to
institute
into
a
living
immediately
under
his
own
nose
the
enemy
of
his
favourite
chaplain
.
  
<EOS>
All
through
dinner
the
archdeacon
's
good
humour
shone
brightly
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
ate
of
the
good
things
heartily
,
he
drank
wine
with
his
wife
and
daughter
,
he
talked
pleasantly
of
his
doings
at
Oxford
,
told
his
father
-
in
-
law
that
he
ought
to
visit
Dr.
Gwynne
at
Lazarus
,
and
launched
out
again
in
praise
of
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr.
Arabin
married
,
Papa
?
"
asked
Griselda
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
,
the
fellow
of
a
college
is
never
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
a
young
man
,
Papa
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
About
forty
,
I
believe
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Griselda
.
<EOS>
Had
her
father
said
eighty
,
Mr.
Arabin
would
not
have
appeared
to
her
to
be
very
much
older
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
two
gentlemen
were
left
alone
over
their
wine
,
Mr.
Harding
told
his
tale
of
woe
.
<EOS>
But
even
this
,
sad
as
it
was
,
did
not
much
diminish
the
archdeacon
's
good
humour
,
though
it
greatly
added
to
his
pugnacity
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
ca
n't
do
it
,
"
said
Dr.
Grantly
over
and
over
again
,
as
his
father
-
in
-
law
explained
to
him
the
terms
on
which
the
new
warden
of
the
hospital
was
to
be
appointed
;
"
he
ca
n't
do
it
.
<EOS>
What
he
says
is
not
worth
the
trouble
of
listening
to
.
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
alter
the
duties
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
ca
n't
?
"
asked
the
ex
-
warden
.
  
<EOS>
"
Neither
the
bishop
nor
the
chaplain
,
nor
yet
the
bishop
's
wife
,
who
,
I
take
it
,
has
really
more
to
say
to
such
matters
than
either
of
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
The
whole
body
corporate
of
the
palace
together
have
no
power
to
turn
the
warden
of
the
hospital
into
a
Sunday
-
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
bishop
has
the
power
to
appoint
whom
he
pleases
,
and
 
"
  
"
I
do
n't
know
that
;
I
rather
think
he
'll
find
he
has
no
such
power
.
<EOS>
Let
him
try
it
,
and
see
what
the
press
will
say
.
<EOS>
For
once
we
shall
have
the
popular
cry
on
our
side
.
<EOS>
But
Proudie
,
ass
as
he
is
,
knows
the
world
too
well
to
get
such
a
hornet
's
nest
about
his
ears
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
winced
at
the
idea
of
the
press
.
<EOS>
He
had
had
enough
of
that
sort
of
publicity
,
and
was
unwilling
to
be
shown
up
a
second
time
either
as
a
monster
or
as
a
martyr
.
<EOS>
He
gently
remarked
that
he
hoped
the
newspapers
would
not
get
hold
of
his
name
again
,
and
then
suggested
that
perhaps
it
would
be
better
that
he
should
abandon
his
object
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
getting
old
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
after
all
I
doubt
whether
I
am
fit
to
undertake
new
duties
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
New
duties
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
archdeacon
;
"
do
n't
I
tell
you
there
shall
be
no
new
duties
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Or
perhaps
old
duties
either
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
;
"
I
think
I
will
remain
content
as
I
am
.
"
<EOS>
The
picture
of
Mr.
Slope
carting
away
the
rubbish
was
still
present
to
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
drank
off
his
glass
of
claret
and
prepared
himself
to
be
energetic
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
hope
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
you
are
not
going
to
be
so
weak
as
to
allow
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Slope
to
deter
you
from
doing
what
you
know
it
is
your
duty
to
do
.
<EOS>
You
know
it
is
your
duty
to
resume
your
place
at
the
hospital
now
that
parliament
has
so
settled
the
stipend
as
to
remove
those
difficulties
which
induced
you
to
resign
it
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
deny
this
,
and
should
your
timidity
now
prevent
you
from
doing
so
,
your
conscience
will
hereafter
never
forgive
you
,
"
and
as
he
finished
this
clause
of
his
speech
,
he
pushed
over
the
bottle
to
his
companion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
conscience
will
never
forgive
you
,
"
he
continued
.
<EOS>
"
You
resigned
the
place
from
conscientious
scruples
,
scruples
which
I
greatly
respected
,
though
I
did
not
share
them
.
<EOS>
All
your
friends
respected
them
,
and
you
left
your
old
house
as
rich
in
reputation
as
you
were
ruined
in
fortune
.
<EOS>
It
is
now
expected
that
you
will
return
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
was
saying
only
the
other
day
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Dr.
Gwynne
does
not
reflect
how
much
older
a
man
I
am
now
than
when
he
last
saw
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Old
 
nonsense
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
;
"
you
never
thought
yourself
old
till
you
listened
to
the
impudent
trash
of
that
coxcomb
at
the
palace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
sixty
-
five
if
I
live
till
November
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
seventy
-
five
,
if
you
live
till
November
ten
years
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
And
you
bid
fair
to
be
as
efficient
then
as
you
were
ten
years
ago
.
<EOS>
But
for
heaven
's
sake
let
us
have
no
pretence
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
Your
plea
of
old
age
is
a
pretence
.
<EOS>
But
you
're
not
drinking
your
wine
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
a
pretence
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
you
are
half
-
afraid
of
this
Slope
,
and
would
rather
subject
yourself
to
comparative
poverty
and
discomfort
than
come
to
blows
with
a
man
who
will
trample
on
you
,
if
you
let
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
do
n't
like
coming
to
blows
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
I
neither
 
<EOS>
but
sometimes
we
ca
n't
help
it
.
<EOS>
This
man
's
object
is
to
induce
you
to
refuse
the
hospital
,
that
he
may
put
some
creature
of
his
own
into
it
;
that
he
may
show
his
power
and
insult
us
all
by
insulting
you
,
whose
cause
and
character
are
so
intimately
bound
up
with
that
of
the
chapter
.
<EOS>
You
owe
it
to
us
all
to
resist
him
in
this
,
even
if
you
have
no
solicitude
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
But
surely
,
for
your
own
sake
,
you
will
not
be
so
lily
-
livered
as
to
fall
into
this
trap
which
he
has
baited
for
you
and
let
him
take
the
very
bread
out
of
your
mouth
without
a
struggle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
did
not
like
being
called
lily
-
livered
,
and
was
rather
inclined
to
resent
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
there
is
any
true
courage
,
"
said
he
,
"
in
squabbling
for
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
honest
men
did
not
squabble
for
money
,
in
this
wicked
world
of
ours
,
the
dishonest
men
would
get
it
all
,
and
I
do
not
see
that
the
cause
of
virtue
would
be
much
improved
.
<EOS>
No
 
we
must
use
the
means
which
we
have
.
<EOS>
If
we
were
to
carry
your
argument
home
,
we
might
give
away
every
shilling
of
revenue
which
the
church
has
,
and
I
presume
you
are
not
prepared
to
say
that
the
church
would
be
strengthened
by
such
a
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
filled
his
glass
and
then
emptied
it
,
drinking
with
much
reverence
a
silent
toast
to
the
well
-
being
and
permanent
security
of
those
temporalities
which
were
so
dear
to
his
soul
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
all
quarrels
between
a
clergyman
and
his
bishop
should
be
avoided
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
too
,
but
it
is
quite
as
much
the
duty
of
the
bishop
to
look
to
that
as
of
his
inferior
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
,
my
friend
;
I
'll
see
the
bishop
in
this
matter
 
that
is
,
if
you
will
allow
me
 
and
you
may
be
sure
I
will
not
compromise
you
.
<EOS>
My
opinion
is
that
all
this
trash
about
the
Sunday
-
schools
and
the
sermons
has
originated
wholly
with
Slope
and
Mrs.
Proudie
,
and
that
the
bishop
knows
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
ca
n't
very
well
refuse
to
see
me
,
and
I
'll
come
upon
him
when
he
has
neither
his
wife
nor
his
chaplain
by
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
'll
find
that
it
will
end
in
his
sending
you
the
appointment
without
any
condition
whatever
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
the
seats
in
the
cathedral
,
we
may
safely
leave
that
to
Mr.
Dean
.
<EOS>
I
believe
the
fool
positively
thinks
that
the
bishop
could
walk
away
with
the
cathedral
if
he
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
the
matter
was
arranged
between
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
had
come
expressly
for
advice
,
and
therefore
felt
himself
bound
to
take
the
advice
given
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
known
,
moreover
,
beforehand
that
the
archdeacon
would
not
hear
of
his
giving
the
matter
up
,
and
accordingly
,
though
he
had
in
perfect
good
faith
put
forward
his
own
views
,
he
was
prepared
to
yield
.
  
<EOS>
They
therefore
went
into
the
drawing
-
room
in
good
humour
with
each
other
,
and
the
evening
passed
pleasantly
in
prophetic
discussions
on
the
future
wars
of
Arabin
and
Slope
.
<EOS>
The
frogs
and
the
mice
would
be
nothing
to
them
,
nor
the
angers
of
Agamemnon
and
Achilles
.
<EOS>
How
the
archdeacon
rubbed
his
hands
and
plumed
himself
on
the
success
of
his
last
move
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
himself
descend
into
the
arena
with
Slope
,
but
Arabin
would
have
no
such
scruples
.
<EOS>
Arabin
was
exactly
the
man
for
such
work
,
and
the
only
man
whom
he
knew
that
was
fit
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
's
good
humour
and
high
buoyancy
continued
till
,
when
reclining
on
his
pillow
,
Mrs.
Grantly
commenced
to
give
him
her
view
of
the
state
of
affairs
at
Barchester
.
<EOS>
And
then
certainly
he
was
startled
.
<EOS>
The
last
words
he
said
that
night
were
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
"
If
she
does
,
by
heaven
I
'll
never
speak
to
her
again
.
<EOS>
She
dragged
me
into
the
mire
once
,
but
I
'll
not
pollute
myself
with
such
filth
as
that
 
"
<EOS>
And
the
archdeacon
gave
a
shudder
which
shook
the
whole
room
,
so
violently
was
he
convulsed
with
the
thought
which
then
agitated
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
Now
in
this
matter
the
widow
Bold
was
scandalously
ill
-
treated
by
her
relatives
.
<EOS>
She
had
spoken
to
the
man
three
or
four
times
,
and
had
expressed
her
willingness
to
teach
in
a
Sunday
-
school
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
full
extent
of
her
sins
in
the
matter
of
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Poor
Eleanor
!
<EOS>
But
time
will
show
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
Mr.
Harding
returned
to
Barchester
,
no
further
word
having
been
spoken
in
his
hearing
respecting
Mr.
Slope
's
acquaintance
with
his
younger
daughter
.
<EOS>
But
he
observed
that
the
archdeacon
at
breakfast
was
less
cordial
than
he
had
been
on
the
preceding
evening
.
   
<EOS>
The
Widow
's
Suitors
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
lost
no
time
in
availing
himself
of
the
bishop
's
permission
to
see
Mr.
Quiverful
,
and
it
was
in
his
interview
with
this
worthy
pastor
that
he
first
learned
that
Mrs.
Bold
was
worth
the
wooing
.
<EOS>
He
rode
out
to
Puddingdale
to
communicate
to
the
embryo
warden
the
goodwill
of
the
bishop
in
his
favour
,
and
during
the
discussion
on
the
matter
it
was
not
unnatural
that
the
pecuniary
resources
of
Mr.
Harding
and
his
family
should
become
the
subject
of
remark
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
,
with
his
fourteen
children
and
his
four
hundred
a
year
,
was
a
very
poor
man
,
and
the
prospect
of
this
new
preferment
,
which
was
to
be
held
together
with
his
living
,
was
very
grateful
to
him
.
<EOS>
To
what
clergyman
so
circumstanced
would
not
such
a
prospect
be
very
grateful
?
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Quiverful
had
long
been
acquainted
with
Mr.
Harding
,
and
had
received
kindness
at
his
hands
,
so
that
his
heart
misgave
him
as
he
thought
of
supplanting
a
friend
at
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
was
extremely
civil
,
cringingly
civil
,
to
Mr.
Slope
;
treated
him
quite
as
the
great
man
;
entreated
this
great
man
to
do
him
the
honour
to
drink
a
glass
of
sherry
,
at
which
,
as
it
was
very
poor
Marsala
,
the
now
pampered
Slope
turned
up
his
nose
;
and
ended
by
declaring
his
extreme
obligation
to
the
bishop
and
Mr.
Slope
and
his
great
desire
to
accept
the
hospital
,
if
 
if
it
were
certainly
the
case
that
Mr.
Harding
had
refused
it
.
  
<EOS>
What
man
as
needy
as
Mr.
Quiverful
would
have
been
more
disinterested
?
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Harding
did
positively
refuse
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
with
a
certain
air
of
offended
dignity
,
"
when
he
heard
of
the
conditions
to
which
the
appointment
is
now
subjected
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
understand
,
Mr.
Quiverful
,
that
the
same
conditions
will
be
imposed
on
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
cared
nothing
for
the
conditions
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
undertaken
to
preach
any
number
of
sermons
Mr.
Slope
might
have
chosen
to
dictate
,
and
to
pass
every
remaining
hour
of
his
Sundays
within
the
walls
of
a
Sunday
-
school
.
<EOS>
What
sacrifices
,
or
at
any
rate
,
what
promises
would
have
been
too
much
to
make
for
such
an
addition
to
his
income
,
and
for
such
a
house
!
<EOS>
But
his
mind
still
recurred
to
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
said
he
;
"
Mr.
Harding
's
daughter
is
very
rich
,
and
why
should
he
trouble
himself
with
the
hospital
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
Mrs.
Grantly
,
"
said
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
meant
his
widowed
daughter
,
"
said
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
has
twelve
hundred
a
year
of
her
own
,
and
I
suppose
Mr.
Harding
means
to
live
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Twelve
hundred
a
year
of
her
own
!
"
said
Slope
,
and
very
shortly
afterwards
took
his
leave
,
avoiding
,
as
far
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
do
,
any
further
allusion
to
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
Twelve
hundred
a
year
!
"
said
he
to
himself
as
he
rode
slowly
home
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
the
fact
that
Mrs.
Bold
had
twelve
hundred
a
year
of
her
own
,
what
a
fool
would
he
be
to
oppose
her
father
's
return
to
his
old
place
.
<EOS>
The
train
of
Mr.
Slope
's
ideas
will
probably
be
plain
to
all
my
readers
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
not
make
the
twelve
hundred
a
year
his
own
?
<EOS>
And
if
he
did
so
,
would
it
not
be
well
for
him
to
have
a
father
-
in
-
law
comfortably
provided
with
the
good
things
of
this
world
?
<EOS>
Would
it
not
,
moreover
,
be
much
more
easy
for
him
to
gain
the
daughter
if
he
did
all
in
his
power
to
forward
the
father
's
views
?
  
<EOS>
These
questions
presented
themselves
to
him
in
a
very
forcible
way
,
and
yet
there
were
many
points
of
doubt
.
<EOS>
If
he
resolved
to
restore
to
Mr.
Harding
his
former
place
,
he
must
take
the
necessary
steps
for
doing
so
at
once
;
he
must
immediately
talk
over
the
bishop
,
quarrel
on
the
matter
with
Mrs.
Proudie
,
whom
he
knew
he
could
not
talk
over
,
and
let
Mr.
Quiverful
know
that
he
had
been
a
little
too
precipitate
as
to
Mr.
Harding
's
positive
refusal
.
<EOS>
That
he
could
effect
all
this
he
did
not
doubt
,
but
he
did
not
wish
to
effect
it
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
wish
to
give
way
to
Mr.
Harding
and
then
be
rejected
by
the
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
wish
to
lose
one
influential
friend
before
he
had
gained
another
.
  
<EOS>
And
thus
he
rode
home
,
meditating
many
things
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
It
occurred
to
him
that
Mrs.
Bold
was
sister
-
in
-
law
to
the
archdeacon
,
and
that
not
even
for
twelve
hundred
a
year
would
he
submit
to
that
imperious
man
.
<EOS>
A
rich
wife
was
a
great
desideratum
to
him
,
but
success
in
his
profession
was
still
greater
;
there
were
,
moreover
,
other
rich
women
who
might
be
willing
to
become
wives
;
and
after
all
,
this
twelve
hundred
a
year
might
,
when
inquired
into
,
melt
away
into
some
small
sum
utterly
beneath
his
notice
.
<EOS>
Then
also
he
remembered
that
Mrs.
Bold
had
a
son
.
  
<EOS>
Another
circumstance
also
much
influenced
him
,
though
it
was
one
which
may
almost
be
said
to
have
influenced
him
against
his
will
.
<EOS>
The
vision
of
the
Signora
Neroni
was
perpetually
before
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
too
much
to
say
that
Mr.
Slope
was
lost
in
love
,
but
yet
he
thought
,
and
kept
continually
thinking
,
that
he
had
never
seen
so
beautiful
a
woman
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
whose
nature
was
open
to
such
impulses
,
and
the
wiles
of
the
Italianized
charmer
had
been
thoroughly
successful
in
imposing
upon
his
thoughts
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
talk
about
his
heart
:
not
that
he
had
no
heart
,
but
because
his
heart
had
little
to
do
with
his
present
feelings
.
<EOS>
His
taste
had
been
pleased
,
his
eyes
charmed
,
and
his
vanity
gratified
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
dazzled
by
a
sort
of
loveliness
which
he
had
never
before
seen
,
and
had
been
caught
by
an
easy
,
free
,
voluptuous
manner
which
was
perfectly
new
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
been
so
tempted
before
,
and
the
temptation
was
now
irresistible
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
owned
to
himself
that
he
cared
for
this
woman
more
than
for
others
around
him
,
but
yet
he
thought
often
of
the
time
when
he
might
see
her
next
,
and
made
,
almost
unconsciously
,
little
cunning
plans
for
seeing
her
frequently
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
called
at
Dr.
Stanhope
's
house
the
day
after
the
bishop
's
party
,
and
then
the
warmth
of
his
admiration
had
been
fed
with
fresh
fuel
.
<EOS>
If
the
signora
had
been
kind
in
her
manner
and
flattering
in
her
speech
when
lying
upon
the
bishop
's
sofa
,
with
the
eyes
of
so
many
on
her
,
she
had
been
much
more
so
in
her
mother
's
drawing
-
room
,
with
no
one
present
but
her
sister
to
repress
either
her
nature
or
her
art
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
thus
left
her
quite
bewildered
,
and
could
not
willingly
admit
into
his
brain
any
scheme
a
part
of
which
would
be
the
necessity
of
his
abandoning
all
further
special
friendship
with
this
lady
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
he
slowly
rode
along
,
very
meditative
.
  
<EOS>
And
here
the
author
must
beg
it
to
be
remembered
that
Mr.
Slope
was
not
in
all
things
a
bad
man
.
<EOS>
His
motives
,
like
those
of
most
men
,
were
mixed
,
and
though
his
conduct
was
generally
very
different
from
that
which
we
would
wish
to
praise
,
it
was
actuated
perhaps
as
often
as
that
of
the
majority
of
the
world
by
a
desire
to
do
his
duty
.
<EOS>
He
believed
in
the
religion
which
he
taught
,
harsh
,
unpalatable
,
uncharitable
as
that
religion
was
.
<EOS>
He
believed
those
whom
he
wished
to
get
under
his
hoof
,
the
Grantlys
and
Gwynnes
of
the
church
,
to
be
the
enemies
of
that
religion
.
<EOS>
He
believed
himself
to
be
a
pillar
of
strength
,
destined
to
do
great
things
,
and
with
that
subtle
,
selfish
,
ambiguous
sophistry
to
which
the
minds
of
all
men
are
so
subject
,
he
had
taught
himself
to
think
that
in
doing
much
for
the
promotion
of
his
own
interests
,
he
was
doing
much
also
for
the
promotion
of
religion
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Slope
had
never
been
an
immoral
man
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
had
resisted
temptations
to
immorality
with
a
strength
of
purpose
that
was
creditable
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
early
in
life
devoted
himself
to
works
which
were
not
compatible
with
the
ordinary
pleasures
of
youth
,
and
he
had
abandoned
such
pleasures
not
without
a
struggle
.
<EOS>
It
must
therefore
be
conceived
that
he
did
not
admit
to
himself
that
he
warmly
admired
the
beauty
of
a
married
woman
without
heart
-
felt
stings
of
conscience
;
and
to
pacify
that
conscience
he
had
to
teach
himself
that
the
nature
of
his
admiration
was
innocent
.
  
<EOS>
And
thus
he
rode
along
meditative
and
ill
at
ease
.
<EOS>
His
conscience
had
not
a
word
to
say
against
his
choosing
the
widow
and
her
fortune
.
<EOS>
That
he
looked
upon
as
a
godly
work
rather
than
otherwise
;
as
a
deed
which
,
if
carried
through
,
would
redound
to
his
credit
as
a
Christian
.
<EOS>
On
that
side
lay
no
future
remorse
,
no
conduct
which
he
might
probably
have
to
forget
,
no
inward
stings
.
<EOS>
If
it
should
turn
out
to
be
really
the
fact
that
Mrs.
Bold
had
twelve
hundred
a
year
at
her
own
disposal
,
Mr.
Slope
would
rather
look
upon
it
as
a
duty
which
he
owed
his
religion
to
make
himself
the
master
of
the
wife
and
the
money
;
as
a
duty
too
,
in
which
some
amount
of
self
-
sacrifice
would
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
to
give
up
his
friendship
with
the
signora
,
his
resistance
to
Mr.
Harding
,
his
antipathy
 
<EOS>
no
,
he
found
on
mature
self
-
examination
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
give
up
his
antipathy
to
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
He
would
marry
the
lady
as
the
enemy
of
her
brother
-
in
-
law
if
such
an
arrangement
suited
her
;
if
not
,
she
must
look
elsewhere
for
a
husband
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
with
such
resolve
as
this
that
he
reached
Barchester
.
<EOS>
He
would
at
once
ascertain
what
the
truth
might
be
as
to
the
lady
's
wealth
,
and
having
done
this
he
would
be
ruled
by
circumstances
in
his
conduct
respecting
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
If
he
found
that
he
could
turn
round
and
secure
the
place
for
Mr.
Harding
without
much
self
-
sacrifice
,
he
would
do
so
;
but
if
not
,
he
would
woo
the
daughter
in
opposition
to
the
father
.
<EOS>
But
in
no
case
would
he
succumb
to
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
He
saw
his
horse
taken
round
to
the
stable
,
and
immediately
went
forth
to
commence
his
inquiries
.
<EOS>
To
give
Mr.
Slope
his
due
,
he
was
not
a
man
who
ever
let
much
grass
grow
under
his
feet
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Eleanor
!
<EOS>
She
was
doomed
to
be
the
intended
victim
of
more
schemes
than
one
.
  
<EOS>
About
the
time
that
Mr.
Slope
was
visiting
the
vicar
of
Puddingdale
,
a
discussion
took
place
respecting
her
charms
and
wealth
at
Dr.
Stanhope
's
house
in
the
close
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
morning
callers
there
,
and
people
had
told
some
truth
and
also
some
falsehood
respecting
the
property
which
John
Bold
had
left
behind
him
.
<EOS>
By
degrees
the
visitors
went
,
and
as
the
doctor
went
with
them
,
and
as
the
doctor
's
wife
had
not
made
her
appearance
,
Charlotte
Stanhope
and
her
brother
were
left
together
.
<EOS>
He
was
sitting
idly
at
the
table
,
scrawling
caricatures
of
Barchester
notables
,
then
yawning
,
then
turning
over
a
book
or
two
,
and
evidently
at
a
loss
how
to
kill
his
time
without
much
labour
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
done
much
,
Bertie
,
about
getting
any
orders
,
"
said
his
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
Orders
!
"
said
he
;
"
who
on
earth
is
there
at
Barchester
to
give
one
orders
?
<EOS>
Who
among
the
people
here
could
possibly
think
it
worth
his
while
to
have
his
head
done
into
marble
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
mean
to
give
up
your
profession
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
n't
,
"
said
he
,
going
on
with
some
absurd
portrait
of
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Look
at
that
,
Lotte
;
is
n't
it
the
little
man
all
over
,
apron
and
all
?
<EOS>
I
'd
go
on
with
my
profession
at
once
,
as
you
call
it
,
if
the
governor
would
set
me
up
with
a
studio
in
London
;
but
as
to
sculpture
at
Barchester
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
half
the
people
here
do
n't
know
what
a
torso
means
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
governor
will
not
give
you
a
shilling
to
start
you
in
London
,
"
said
Lotte
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
ca
n't
give
you
what
would
be
sufficient
,
for
he
has
not
got
it
.
<EOS>
But
you
might
start
yourself
very
well
,
if
you
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
the
deuce
am
I
to
do
it
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
Bertie
,
you
'll
never
make
a
penny
by
any
profession
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
I
often
think
myself
,
"
said
he
,

Some
men
have
a
great
gift
of
making
money
,
but
they
ca
n't
spend
it
.
<EOS>
Others
ca
n't
put
two
shillings
together
,
but
they
have
a
great
talent
for
all
sorts
of
outlay
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
that
my
genius
is
wholly
in
the
latter
line
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
mean
to
live
then
?
"
asked
the
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
must
regard
myself
as
a
young
raven
and
look
for
heavenly
manna
;
besides
,
we
have
all
got
something
when
the
governor
goes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
you
'll
have
enough
to
supply
yourself
with
gloves
and
boots
;
that
is
,
if
the
Jews
have
not
got
the
possession
of
it
all
.
<EOS>
I
believe
they
have
the
most
of
it
already
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
,
Bertie
,
at
your
indifference
;
that
you
,
with
your
talents
and
personal
advantages
,
should
never
try
to
settle
yourself
in
life
.
<EOS>
I
look
forward
with
dread
to
the
time
when
the
governor
must
go
.
<EOS>
Mother
,
and
Madeline
,
and
I
 
<EOS>
we
shall
be
poor
enough
,
but
you
will
have
absolutely
nothing

<EOS>
"
  
"
Sufficient
for
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof
,
"
said
Bertie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
take
my
advice
?
"
said
his
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
Cela
dépend
_
,
"
said
the
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
marry
a
wife
with
money
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
wo
n't
marry
one
without
;
wives
with
money
a'nt
so
easy
to
get
now
-
a
-
days
;
the
parsons
pick
them
all
up

<EOS>

And
a
parson
will
pick
up
the
wife
I

for
you

if
you
do
not
look
quickly
about
it

the
wife
I
mean

Mrs.
Bold

"
  
<EOS>
"
Whew

"
whistled
Bertie
,
"
a
widow
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
very
beautiful
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
  
<EOS>
"
With
a
son
and
heir
all
ready
to
my
hand
,
"
said
Bertie
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
baby
that
will
very
likely
die
,

said
Charlotte
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
that
,
"
said
Bertie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
however
,
he
may
live
for
me
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
wish
to
kill
him
;
only
,
it
must
be
owned
that
a
ready
-
made
family
is
a
drawback
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
only
one
after
all
,
"
pleaded
Charlotte
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
that
a
very
little
one
,
as
the
maidservant
said
,
"
rejoined
Bertie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Beggars
must
n't
be
choosers
,
Bertie
;
you
ca
n't
have
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
knows
I
am
not
unreasonable
,
"
said
he
,
"
nor
yet
opinionated
,
and
if
you
'll
arrange
it
all
for
me
,
Lotte
,
I
'll
marry
the
lady
.
<EOS>
Only
mark
this
:
the
money
must
be
sure
,
and
the
income
at
my
own
disposal
,
at
any
rate
for
the
lady
's
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Charlotte
was
explaining
to
her
brother
that
he
must
make
love
for
himself
if
he
meant
to
carry
on
the
matter
,
and
was
encouraging
him
to
do
so
by
warm
eulogiums
on
Eleanor
's
beauty
,
when
the
signora
was
brought
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
When
at
home
,
and
subject
to
the
gaze
of
none
but
her
own
family
,
she
allowed
herself
to
be
dragged
about
by
two
persons
,
and
her
two
bearers
now
deposited
her
on
her
sofa
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
quite
so
grand
in
her
apparel
as
she
had
been
at
the
bishop
's
party
,
but
yet
she
was
dressed
with
much
care
,
and
though
there
was
a
look
of
care
and
pain
about
her
eyes
,
she
was
,
even
by
daylight
,
extremely
beautiful
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Madeline
,
so
I
'm
going
to
be
married
,
"
Bertie
began
as
soon
as
the
servants
had
withdrawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
other
foolish
thing
left
that
you
have
n't
done
,
"
said
Madeline
,
"
and
therefore
you
are
quite
right
to
try
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
think
it
's
a
foolish
thing
,
do
you
?
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
Lotte
advising
me
to
marry
by
all
means
.
<EOS>
But
on
such
a
subject
your
opinion
ought
to
be
the
best
;
you
have
experience
to
guide
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
have
,
"
said
Madeline
with
a
sort
of
harsh
sadness
in
her
tone
,
which
seemed
to
say
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
to
you
if
I
am
sad
?
<EOS>
I
have
never
asked
your
sympathy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bertie
was
sorry
when
he
saw
that
she
was
hurt
by
what
he
said
,
and
he
came
and
squatted
on
the
floor
close
before
her
face
to
make
his
peace
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Mad
,
I
was
only
joking
;
you
know
that
.
<EOS>
But
in
sober
earnest
,
Lotte
is
advising
me
to
marry
.
<EOS>
She
wants
me
to
marry
this
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
She
's
a
widow
with
lots
of
tin
,
a
fine
baby
,
a
beautiful
complexion
,
and
the
George
and
Dragon
hotel
up
in
the
High
Street
.
<EOS>
By
Jove
,
Lotte
,
if
I
marry
her
,
I
'll
keep
the
public
-
house
myself
 
<EOS>
it
's
just
the
life
to
suit
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
"
said
Madeline
,
"
that
vapid
,
swarthy
creature
in
the
widow
's
cap
,
who
looked
as
though
her
clothes
had
been
stuck
on
her
back
with
a
pitchfork
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
signora
never
allowed
any
woman
to
be
beautiful
.
  
<EOS>
"
Instead
of
being
vapid
,
"
said
Lotte
,
"
<EOS>
I
call
her
a
very
lovely
woman
.
<EOS>
She
was
by
far
the
loveliest
woman
in
the
rooms
the
other
night
;
that
is
,
excepting
you
,
Madeline
.
"
  
<EOS>
Even
the
compliment
did
not
soften
the
asperity
of
the
maimed
beauty
.
<EOS>
"
Every
woman
is
charming
according
to
Lotte
,
"
she
said
;
"
I
never
knew
an
eye
with
so
little
true
appreciation
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
what
woman
on
earth
could
look
well
in
such
a
thing
as
that
she
had
on
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
she
wears
a
widow
's
cap
,
but
she
'll
put
that
off
when
Bertie
marries
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
any
of
course
in
it
,
"
said
Madeline
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
death
of
twenty
husbands
should
not
make
me
undergo
such
a
penance
.
<EOS>
It
is
as
much
a
relic
of
paganism
as
the
sacrifice
of
a
Hindu
woman
at
the
burning
of
her
husband
's
body
.
<EOS>
If
not
so
bloody
,
it
is
quite
as
barbarous
,
and
quite
as
useless
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
n't
blame
her
for
that
,
"
said
Bertie
.
<EOS>
"
She
does
it
because
it
's
the
custom
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
People
would
think
ill
of
her
if
she
did
n't
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
,
"
said
Madeline
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
just
one
of
those
English
nonentities
who
would
tie
her
head
up
in
a
bag
for
three
months
every
summer
,
if
her
mother
and
her
grandmother
had
tied
up
their
heads
before
her
.
<EOS>
It
would
never
occur
to
her
to
think
whether
there
was
any
use
in
submitting
to
such
a
nuisance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
hard
in
a
country
like
England
,
for
a
young
woman
to
set
herself
in
opposition
to
prejudices
of
that
sort
,
"
said
the
prudent
Charlotte
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
you
mean
is
that
it
's
very
hard
for
a
fool
not
to
be
a
fool
,
"
said
Madeline
.
  
<EOS>
Bertie
Stanhope
had
been
so
much
knocked
about
the
world
from
his
earliest
years
that
he
had
not
retained
much
respect
for
the
gravity
of
English
customs
;
but
even
to
his
mind
an
idea
presented
itself
that
,
perhaps
in
a
wife
,
true
British
prejudice
would
not
in
the
long
run
be
less
agreeable
than
Anglo
-
Italian
freedom
from
restraint
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
exactly
say
so
,
but
he
expressed
the
idea
in
another
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
if
I
were
to
die
,
and
then
walk
,
I
should
think
that
my
widow
looked
better
in
one
of
those
caps
than
any
other
kind
of
head
-
dress
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
 
<EOS>
and
you
'd
fancy
also
that
she
could
do
nothing
better
than
shut
herself
up
and
cry
for
you
,
or
else
<EOS>
burn
herself
.
<EOS>
But
she
would
think
differently
.
<EOS>
She
'd
probably
wear
one
of
those
horrid
she
-
helmets
,
because
she
'd
want
the
courage
not
to
do
so
;
but
she
'd
wear
it
with
a
heart
longing
for
the
time
when
she
might
be
allowed
to
throw
it
off
.
<EOS>
I
hate
such
shallow
false
pretences
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
I
would
let
the
world
say
what
it
pleased
,
and
show
no
grief
if
I
felt
none
 
and
perhaps
not
,
if
I
did
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
wearing
a
widow
's
cap
wo
n't
lessen
her
fortune
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
  
<EOS>
"
Or
increase
it
,
"
said
Madeline
.
<EOS>
"
Then
why
on
earth
does
she
do
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Lotte
's
object
is
to
make
her
put
it
off
,
"
said
Bertie
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
be
true
that
she
has
got
twelve
hundred
a
year
quite
at
her
own
disposal
,
and
she
be
not
utterly
vulgar
in
her
manners
,
I
would
advise
you
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
she
's
to
be
had
for
the
asking
:
and
as
you
are
not
going
to
marry
her
for
love
,
it
does
n't
much
matter
whether
she
is
good
-
looking
or
not
.
<EOS>
As
to
your
really
marrying
a
woman
for
love
,
I
do
n't
believe
you
are
fool
enough
for
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Madeline
!
"
exclaimed
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
oh
,
Charlotte
!
"
said
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
no
man
can
love
a
woman
unless
he
be
a
fool
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
very
much
the
same
thing
 
that
any
man
who
is
willing
to
sacrifice
his
interest
to
get
possession
of
a
pretty
face
is
a
fool
.
<EOS>
Pretty
faces
are
to
be
had
cheaper
than
that
.
<EOS>
I
hate
your
mawkish
sentimentality
,
Lotte
.
<EOS>
You
know
as
well
as
I
do
in
what
way
husbands
and
wives
generally
live
together
;
you
know
how
far
the
warmth
of
conjugal
affection
can
withstand
the
trial
of
a
bad
dinner
,
of
a
rainy
day
,
or
of
the
least
privation
which
poverty
brings
with
it
;
you
know
what
freedom
a
man
claims
for
himself
,
what
slavery
he
would
exact
from
his
wife
if
he
could
!
<EOS>
And
you
know
also
how
wives
generally
obey
.
<EOS>
Marriage
means
tyranny
on
one
side
and
deceit
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
say
that
a
man
is
a
fool
to
sacrifice
his
interests
for
such
a
bargain
.
<EOS>
A
woman
,
too
generally
,
has
no
other
way
of
living
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Bertie
has
no
other
way
of
living
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
in
God
's
name
,
let
him
marry
Mrs.
Bold
,
"
said
Madeline
.
<EOS>
And
so
it
was
settled
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
But
let
the
gentle
-
hearted
reader
be
under
no
apprehension
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
destined
that
Eleanor
shall
marry
Mr.
Slope
or
Bertie
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
And
here
perhaps
it
may
be
allowed
to
the
novelist
to
explain
his
views
on
a
very
important
point
in
the
art
of
telling
tales
.
<EOS>
He
ventures
to
reprobate
that
system
which
goes
so
far
to
violate
all
proper
confidence
between
the
author
and
his
readers
by
maintaining
nearly
to
the
end
of
the
third
volume
a
mystery
as
to
the
fate
of
their
favourite
personage
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
more
,
and
worse
than
this
,
is
too
frequently
done
.
<EOS>
Have
not
often
the
profoundest
efforts
of
genius
been
used
to
baffle
the
aspirations
of
the
reader
,
to
raise
false
hopes
and
false
fears
,
and
to
give
rise
to
expectations
which
are
never
to
be
realized
?
<EOS>
Are
not
promises
all
but
made
of
delightful
horrors
,
in
lieu
of
which
the
writer
produces
nothing
but
most
commonplace
realities
in
his
final
chapter
?
<EOS>
And
is
there
not
a
species
of
deceit
in
this
to
which
the
honesty
of
the
present
age
should
lend
no
countenance
?
  
<EOS>
And
what
can
be
the
worth
of
that
solicitude
which
a
peep
into
the
third
volume
can
utterly
dissipate
?
<EOS>
What
the
value
of
those
literary
charms
which
are
absolutely
destroyed
by
their
enjoyment
?
<EOS>
When
we
have
once
learnt
what
was
that
picture
before
which
was
hung
Mrs.
Ratcliffe
's
solemn
curtain
,
we
feel
no
further
interest
about
either
the
frame
or
the
veil
.
<EOS>
They
are
to
us
merely
a
receptacle
for
old
bones
,
an
inappropriate
coffin
,
which
we
would
wish
to
have
decently
buried
out
of
our
sight
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
how
grievous
a
thing
it
is
to
have
the
pleasure
of
your
novel
destroyed
by
the
ill
-
considered
triumph
of
a
previous
reader
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
need
n't
be
alarmed
for
Augusta
;
of
course
she
accepts
Gustavus
in
the
end
.
"
<EOS>
"
How
very
ill
-
natured
you
are
,
Susan
,
"
says
Kitty
with
tears
in
her
eyes
:
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
a
bit
about
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
Kitty
,
if
you
will
read
my
book
,
you
may
defy
the
ill
-
nature
of
your
sister
.
<EOS>
There
shall
be
no
secret
that
she
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
take
the
third
volume
if
you
please
 
<EOS>
learn
from
the
last
pages
all
the
results
of
our
troubled
story
,
and
the
story
shall
have
lost
none
of
its
interest

if
indeed
there
be
any
interest
in
it

Our
doctrine
is
that
the
author
and
the
reader
should
move
along
together
in
full
confidence
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
Let
the
personages
of
the
drama
undergo
ever
so
complete
a
comedy
of
errors
among
themselves
,
but
let
the
spectator
never
mistake
the
Syracusan
for
the
Ephesian
;
otherwise
he
is
one
of
the
dupes
,
and
the
part
of
a
dupe
is
never
dignified
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
not
for
the
value
of
this
chapter
<EOS>
have
it
believed
by
a
single
reader
that
my
Eleanor
could
bring
herself
to
marry
Mr.
Slope
,
or
that
she
should
be
sacrificed
to
a
Bertie
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
But
among
the
good
folk
of
Barchester
many
believed
both
the
one
and
the
other
.

continued
Mary
Bold
,
taking
up
the
second
part
in
this
concerted
piece
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
audience
at
the
concert
was
the
baby
,
who
however
gave
such
vociferous
applause
that
the
performers
,
presuming
it
to
amount
to
an
encore
,
commenced
again
.

"
and
the
simmering
and
the
kissing
went
on
over
again
,
as
though
the
ladies
were
very
hungry
and
determined
to
eat
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
he
's
his

"
All
these
energetic
exclamations
were
elicited
by
the
delight
of
the
mother
in
finding
that
her
son
was
strong
enough
and
mischievous
enough
to
pull
all
her
hair
out
from
under
her
cap
.

"
  
A
regular
service
of
baby
worship
was
going
on
.
<EOS>
Mary
Bold
was
sitting
on
a
low
easy
chair
,
with
the
boy
in
her
lap
,
and
Eleanor
was
kneeling
before
the
object
of
her
idolatry
.
<EOS>
As
she
tried
to
cover
up
the
little
fellow
's
face
with
her
long
,
glossy
,
dark
brown
locks
,
and
permitted
him
to
pull
them
hither
and
thither
as
he
would
,
she
looked
very
beautiful
in
spite
of
the
widow
's
cap
which
she
still
wore
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
quiet
,
enduring
,
grateful
sweetness
about
her
face
which
grew
so
strongly
upon
those
who
knew
her
,
as
to
make
the
great
praise
of
her
beauty
which
came
from
her
old
friends
appear
marvellously
exaggerated
to
those
who
were
only
slightly
acquainted
with
her
.
<EOS>
Her
loveliness
was
like
that
of
many
landscapes
,
which
require
to
be
often
seen
to
be
fully
enjoyed
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
depth
of
dark
clear
brightness
in
her
eyes
which
was
lost
upon
a
quick
observer
,
a
character
about
her
mouth
which
only
showed
itself
to
those
with
whom
she
familiarly
conversed
,
a
glorious
form
of
head
the
perfect
symmetry
of
which
required
the
eye
of
an
artist
for
its
appreciation
.
<EOS>
She
had
none
of
that
dazzling
brilliancy
,
of
that
voluptuous
Rubens
beauty
,
of
that
pearly
whiteness
,
and
those
vermilion
tints
which
immediately
entranced
with
the
power
of
a
basilisk
men
who
came
within
reach
of
Madeline
Neroni
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
but
impossible
to
resist
the
signora
,
but
no
one
was
called
upon
for
any
resistance
towards
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
You
might
begin
to
talk
to
her
as
though
she
were
your
sister
,
and
it
would
not
be
till
your
head
was
on
your
pillow
that
the
truth
and
intensity
of
her
beauty
would
flash
upon
you
,
that
the
sweetness
of
her
voice
would
come
upon
your
ear
.
<EOS>
A
sudden
half
-
hour
with
the
Neroni
was
like
falling
into
a
pit
,
an
evening
spent
with
Eleanor
like
an
unexpected
ramble
in
some
quiet
fields
of
asphodel
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
'll
cover
him
up
till
there
sha
n't
be
a
morsel
of
his
little
"
ittle
"
ittle
"
ittle
nose
to
be
seen
,
"
said
the
mother
,
stretching
her
streaming
locks
over
the
infant
's
face
.
<EOS>
The
child
screamed
with
delight
,
and
kicked
till
Mary
Bold
was
hardly
able
to
hold
him
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
door
opened
,
and
Mr.
Slope
was
announced
.
<EOS>
Up
jumped
Eleanor
and
,
with
a
sudden
quick
motion
of
her
hands
,
pushed
back
her
hair
over
her
shoulders
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
perhaps
better
for
her
that
she
had
not
,
for
she
thus
showed
more
of
her
confusion
than
she
would
have
done
<EOS>
had
she
remained
as
she
was
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
however
,
immediately
recognized
her
loveliness
and
thought
to
himself
that
,
irrespective
of
her
fortune
,
she
would
be
an
inmate
that
a
man
might
well
desire
for
his
house
,
a
partner
for
his
bosom
's
care
very
well
qualified
to
make
care
lie
easy
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
hurried
out
of
the
room
to
readjust
her
cap
,
muttering
some
unnecessary
apology
about
her
baby
.
<EOS>
And
while
she
is
gone
,
we
will
briefly
go
back
and
state
what
had
been
hitherto
the
results
of
Mr.
Slope
's
meditations
on
his
scheme
of
matrimony
.
  
<EOS>
His
inquiries
as
to
the
widow
's
income
had
at
any
rate
been
so
far
successful
as
to
induce
him
to
determine
to
go
on
with
the
speculation
.
<EOS>
As
regarded
Mr.
Harding
,
he
had
also
resolved
to
do
what
he
could
without
injury
to
himself
.
<EOS>
To
Mrs.
Proudie
he
determined
not
to
speak
on
the
matter
,
at
least
not
at
present
.
<EOS>
His
object
was
to
instigate
a
little
rebellion
on
the
part
of
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
such
a
state
of
things
would
be
advisable
,
not
only
in
respect
to
Messrs.
Harding
and
Quiverful
,
but
also
in
the
affairs
of
the
diocese
generally
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
was
by
no
means
of
opinion
that
Dr.
Proudie
was
fit
to
rule
,
but
he
conscientiously
thought
it
wrong
that
his
brother
clergy
should
be
subjected
to
petticoat
government
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
made
up
his
mind
to
infuse
a
little
of
his
spirit
into
the
bishop
,
sufficient
to
induce
him
to
oppose
his
wife
,
though
not
enough
to
make
him
altogether
insubordinate
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
therefore
taken
an
opportunity
of
again
speaking
to
his
lordship
about
the
hospital
,
and
had
endeavoured
to
make
it
appear
that
after
all
it
would
be
unwise
to
exclude
Mr.
Harding
from
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
however
,
had
a
harder
task
than
he
had
imagined
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
,
anxious
to
assume
to
herself
as
much
as
possible
of
the
merit
of
patronage
,
had
written
to
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
requesting
her
to
call
at
the
palace
,
and
had
then
explained
to
that
matron
,
with
much
mystery
,
condescension
,
and
dignity
,
the
good
that
was
in
store
for
her
and
her
progeny
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Mrs.
Proudie
had
been
so
engaged
at
the
very
time
that
Mr.
Slope
had
been
doing
the
same
with
the
husband
at
Puddingdale
Vicarage
,
and
had
thus
in
a
measure
committed
herself
.
<EOS>
The
thanks
,
the
humility
,
the
gratitude
,
the
surprise
of
Mrs.
Quiverful
had
been
very
overpowering
;
she
had
all
but
embraced
the
knees
of
her
patroness
,
and
had
promised
that
the
prayers
of
fourteen
unprovided
babes
(
so
Mrs.
Quiverful
had
described
her
own
family
,
the
eldest
of
which
was
a
stout
young
woman
of
three
-
and
-
twenty
)
should
be
put
up
to
heaven
morning
and
evening
for
the
munificent
friend
whom
God
had
sent
to
them
.
<EOS>
Such
incense
as
this
was
not
unpleasing
to
Mrs.
Proudie
,
and
she
made
the
most
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
offered
her
general
assistance
to
the
fourteen
unprovided
babes
,
if
,
as
she
had
no
doubt
,
she
should
find
them
worthy
;
expressed
a
hope
that
the
eldest
of
them
would
be
fit
to
undertake
tuition
in
her
Sabbath
-
schools
;
and
altogether
made
herself
a
very
great
lady
in
the
estimation
of
Mrs.
Quiverful
.
  
<EOS>
Having
done
this
,
she
thought
it
prudent
to
drop
a
few
words
before
the
bishop
,
letting
him
know
that
she
had
acquainted
the
Puddingdale
family
with
their
good
fortune
;
so
that
he
might
perceive
that
he
stood
committed
to
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
The
husband
well
understood
the
ruse
of
his
wife
,
but
he
did
not
resent
it
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
she
was
taking
the
patronage
out
of
his
hands
;
he
was
resolved
to
put
an
end
to
her
interference
and
reassume
his
powers
.
<EOS>
But
then
he
thought
this
was
not
the
best
time
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
He
put
off
the
evil
hour
,
as
many
a
man
in
similar
circumstances
has
done
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
Such
having
been
the
case
,
Mr.
Slope
naturally
encountered
a
difficulty
in
talking
over
the
bishop
,
a
difficulty
indeed
which
he
found
could
not
be
overcome
except
at
the
cost
of
a
general
outbreak
at
the
palace
.
<EOS>
A
general
outbreak
at
the
present
moment
might
be
good
policy
,
but
it
also
might
not
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
any
rate
not
a
step
to
be
lightly
taken
.
<EOS>
He
began
by
whispering
to
the
bishop
that
he
feared
that
public
opinion
would
be
against
him
if
Mr.
Harding
did
not
reappear
at
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
answered
with
some
warmth
that
Mr.
Quiverful
had
been
promised
the
appointment
on
Mr.
Slope
's
advice
.
"
<EOS>
Not
promised
?
"
said
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
promised
,
"
replied
the
bishop
,
"
and
Mrs.
Proudie
has
seen
Mrs.
Quiverful
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
quite
unexpected
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Slope
,
but
his
presence
of
mind
did
not
fail
him
,
and
he
turned
the
statement
to
his
own
account
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
my
lord
,
"
said
he
,
"
we
shall
all
be
in
scrapes
if
the
ladies
interfere
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
too
much
in
unison
with
my
lord
's
feelings
to
be
altogether
unpalatable
,
and
yet
such
an
allusion
to
interference
demanded
a
rebuke
.
<EOS>
My
lord
was
somewhat
astounded
also
,
though
not
altogether
made
miserable
,
by
finding
that
there
was
a
point
of
difference
between
his
wife
and
his
chaplain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
by
interference
,
"
said
the
bishop
mildly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
Mrs.
Proudie
heard
that
Mr.
Quiverful
was
to
be
appointed
,
it
was
not
unnatural
that
she
should
wish
to
see
Mrs.
Quiverful
about
the
schools
.
<EOS>
I
really
can
not
say
that
I
see
any
interference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
speak
,
my
lord
,
for
your
own
comfort
,
"
said
Slope
;
"
for
your
own
comfort
and
dignity
in
the
diocese
.
<EOS>
I
can
have
no
other
motive
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
personal
feelings
go
,
Mrs.
Proudie
is
the
best
friend
I
have
.
<EOS>
I
must
always
remember
that
.
<EOS>
But
still
,
in
my
present
position
,
my
first
duty
is
to
your
lordship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
of
that
,
Mr.
Slope
;
I
am
quite
sure
of
that
;
"
said
the
bishop
,
mollified
:
"
and
you
really
think
that
Mr.
Harding
should
have
the
hospital
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Upon
my
word
,
I
'm
inclined
to
think
so
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
prepared
to
take
upon
myself
the
blame
of
first
suggesting
Mr.
Quiverful
's
name
.
<EOS>
But
since
doing
so
,
I
have
found
that
there
is
so
strong
a
feeling
in
the
diocese
in
favour
of
Mr.
Harding
that
I
think
your
lordship
should
give
way
.
<EOS>
I
hear
also
that
Mr.
Harding
has
modified
the
objections
he
first
felt
to
your
lordship
's
propositions
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
what
has
passed
between
Mrs.
Proudie
and
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
the
circumstance
may
be
a
little
inconvenient
,
but
I
really
do
not
think
that
that
should
weigh
in
a
matter
of
so
much
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
thus
the
poor
bishop
was
left
in
a
dreadfully
undecided
step
as
to
what
he
should
do
.
<EOS>
His
mind
,
however
,
slightly
inclined
itself
to
the
appointment
of
Mr.
Harding
,
seeing
that
by
such
a
step
he
should
have
the
assistance
of
Mr.
Slope
in
opposing
Mrs.
Proudie
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
the
state
of
affairs
at
the
palace
,
when
Mr.
Slope
called
at
Mrs.
Bold
's
house
and
found
her
playing
with
her
baby
.
<EOS>
When
she
ran
out
of
the
room
,
Mr.
Slope
began
praising
the
weather
to
Mary
Bold
,
then
he
praised
the
baby
and
kissed
him
,
and
then
he
praised
the
mother
,
and
then
he
praised
Miss
Bold
herself
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
,
however
,
was
not
long
before
she
came
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
apologize
for
calling
at
so
very
early
an
hour
,
"
began
Mr.
Slope
,
"
but
I
was
really
so
anxious
to
speak
to
you
that
I
hope
you
and
Miss
Bold
will
excuse
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
muttered
something
in
which
the
words
"
certainly
,
"
and
"
of
course
,
"
and
"
not
early
at
all
,
"
were
just
audible
,
and
then
apologized
for
her
own
appearance
,
declaring
,
with
a
smile
,
that
her
baby
was
becoming
such
a
big
boy
that
he
was
quite
unmanageable
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
great
big
naughty
boy
,
"
said
she
to
the
child
,
"
and
we
must
send
him
away
to
a
great
big
rough
romping
school
,
where
they
have
great
big
rods
and
do
terrible
things
to
naughty
boys
who
do
n't
do
what
their
own
mammas
tell
them
;
"
and
she
then
commenced
another
course
of
kissing
,
being
actuated
thereto
by
the
terrible
idea
of
sending
her
child
away
which
her
own
imagination
had
depicted
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
the
masters
do
n't
have
such
beautiful
long
hair
to
be
dishevelled
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
taking
up
the
joke
and
paying
a
compliment
at
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
thought
he
might
as
well
have
left
the
compliment
alone
,
but
she
said
nothing
and
looked
nothing
,
being
occupied
as
she
was
with
the
baby
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
take
him
,
"
said
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
clothes
are
nearly
off
his
back
with
his
romping
,
"
and
so
saying
she
left
the
room
with
the
child
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bold
had
heard
Mr.
Slope
say
he
had
something
pressing
to
say
to
Eleanor
,
and
thinking
that
she
might
be
_
de
trop
_
,
<EOS>
took
this
opportunity
of
getting
herself
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
long
,
Mary
,
"
said
Eleanor
as
Miss
Bold
shut
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
to
have
the
opportunity
of
having
ten
minutes
'
conversation
with
you
alone
,
"
began
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
let
me
openly
ask
you
a
plain
question
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
sure
you
will
give
me
a
plain
and
open
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Either
that
,
or
none
at
all
,
"
said
she
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
question
is
this
,
Mrs.
Bold
:
is
your
father
really
anxious
to
go
back
to
the
hospital
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
ask
me
?
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
ask
himself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mrs.
Bold
,
I
'll
tell
you
why
.
<EOS>
There
are
wheels
within
wheels
,
all
of
which
I
would
explain
to
you
,
only
I
fear
that
there
is
not
time
.
<EOS>
It
is
essentially
necessary
that
I
should
have
an
answer
to
this
question
,
otherwise
I
can
not
know
how
to
advance
your
father
's
wishes
;
and
it
is
quite
impossible
that
I
should
ask
himself
.
<EOS>
No
one
can
esteem
your
father
more
than
I
do
,
but
I
doubt
if
this
feeling
is
reciprocal
.
<EOS>
"
It
certainly
was
not
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
be
candid
with
you
as
the
only
means
of
avoiding
ultimate
consequences
,
which
may
be
most
injurious
to
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
I
fear
there
is
a
feeling
 
I
will
not
even
call
it
a
prejudice
 
with
regard
to
myself
in
Barchester
,
which
is
not
in
my
favour
.
<EOS>
You
remember
that
sermon
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Slope
,
we
need
not
go
back
to
that
,
"
said
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
one
moment
,
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
that
I
may
talk
of
myself
,
but
because
it
is
so
essential
that
you
should
understand
how
matters
stand
.
<EOS>
That
sermon
may
have
been
ill
-
judged
 
<EOS>
it
was
certainly
misunderstood
;
but
I
will
say
nothing
about
that
now
;
only
this
,
that
it
did
give
rise
to
a
feeling
against
myself
which
your
father
shares
with
others
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
he
has
proper
cause
,
but
the
result
is
that
he
is
not
inclined
to
meet
me
on
friendly
terms
.
<EOS>
I
put
it
to
yourself
whether
you
do
not
know
this
to
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
made
no
answer
,
and
Mr.
Slope
,
in
the
eagerness
of
his
address
,
edged
his
chair
a
little
nearer
to
the
widow
's
seat
,
unperceived
by
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Such
being
so
,
"
continued
Mr.
Slope
,
"
I
can
not
ask
him
this
question
as
I
can
ask
it
of
you
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
my
delinquencies
since
I
came
to
Barchester
you
have
allowed
me
to
regard
you
as
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
made
a
little
motion
with
her
head
which
was
hardly
confirmatory
,
but
Mr.
Slope
if
he
noticed
it
,
did
not
appear
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
To
you
I
can
speak
openly
and
explain
the
feelings
of
my
heart
.
<EOS>
This
your
father
would
not
allow
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
,
the
bishop
has
thought
it
right
that
this
matter
of
the
hospital
should
pass
through
my
hands
.
<EOS>
There
have
been
some
details
to
get
up
with
which
he
would
not
trouble
himself
,
and
thus
it
has
come
to
pass
that
I
was
forced
to
have
an
interview
with
your
father
on
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
aware
of
that
,
"
said
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
that
interview
Mr.
Harding
left
the
impression
on
my
mind
that
he
did
not
wish
to
return
to
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
could
that
be
?
"
said
Eleanor
,
<EOS>
at
last
stirred
up
to
forget
the
cold
propriety
of
demeanour
which
she
had
determined
to
maintain
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mrs.
Bold
,
I
give
you
my
word
that
such
was
the
case
,
"
said
he
,
again
getting
a
little
nearer
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
what
is
more
than
that
,
before
my
interview
with
Mr.
Harding
,
certain
persons
at
the
palace
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
the
bishop
 
had
told
me
that
such
was
the
fact
.
<EOS>
I
own
,
I
hardly
believed
it
;
I
own
,
I
thought
that
your
father
would
wish
on
every
account
,
for
conscience
"
sake
,
for
the
sake
of
those
old
men
,
for
old
association
and
the
memory
of
dear
days
long
gone
by
,
on
every
account
I
thought
that
he
would
wish
to
resume
his
duties
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
told
that
such
was
not
his
wish
,
and
he
certainly
left
me
with
the
impression
that
I
had
been
told
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
!
"
said
Eleanor
,
now
sufficiently
roused
on
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
Miss
Bold
's
step
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
;
"
would
it
be
asking
too
great
a
favour
to
beg
you
to
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
can
manage
anything
with
Miss
Bold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
did
not
like
the
word
manage
,
but
still
she
went
out
and
asked
Mary
to
leave
them
alone
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Mrs.
Bold
 
I
am
so
very
grateful
for
this
confidence
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
left
your
father
with
this
impression
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
may
say
that
he
made
me
understand
that
he
declined
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
the
appointment
,
"
said
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
he
did
not
decline
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
But
he
said
that
he
would
not
agree
 
that
is
,
that
he
did
not
like
the
scheme
about
the
schools
and
the
services
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
sure
he
never
said
that
he
wished
to
refuse
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mrs.
Bold
!
"
said
Mr.
Slope
in
a
manner
almost
impassioned
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
for
the
world
say
to
so
good
a
daughter
a
word
against
so
good
a
father
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
,
for
his
sake
,
let
me
show
you
exactly
how
the
matter
stands
at
present
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
was
a
little
flurried
when
I
told
him
of
the
bishop
's
wishes
about
the
school
.
<EOS>
I
did
so
perhaps
with
the
less
caution
because
you
yourself
had
so
perfectly
agreed
with
me
on
the
same
subject
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
little
put
out
and
spoke
warmly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tell
the
bishop
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
I
quite
disagree
with
him
 
and
shall
not
return
to
the
hospital
as
such
conditions
are
attached
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
What
he
said
was
to
that
effect
;
indeed
,
his
words
were
,
if
anything
,
stronger
than
those
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
alternative
but
to
repeat
them
to
his
lordship
,
who
said
that
he
could
look
on
them
in
no
other
light
than
a
refusal
.
<EOS>
He
also
had
heard
the
report
that
your
father
did
not
wish
for
the
appointment
,
and
putting
all
these
things
together
,
he
thought
he
had
no
choice
but
to
look
for
someone
else
.
<EOS>
He
has
consequently
offered
the
place
to
Mr.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Offered
the
place
to
Mr.
Quiverful
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Eleanor
,
her
eyes
suffused
with
tears
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
Mr.
Slope
,
there
is
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
friend
 
not
so
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
to
prevent
such
being
the
end
of
it
that
I
am
now
here
.
<EOS>
I
may
at
any
rate
presume
that
I
have
got
an
answer
to
my
question
,
and
that
Mr.
Harding
is
desirous
of
returning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Desirous
of
returning
 
of
course
he
is
,
"
said
Eleanor
;
"
of
course
he
wishes
to
have
back
his
house
and
his
income
and
his
place
in
the
world
;
to
have
back
what
he
gave
up
with
such
self
-
denying
honesty
,
if
he
can
have
them
without
restraints
on
his
conduct
to
which
at
his
age
it
would
be
impossible
that
he
should
submit
.
<EOS>
How
can
the
bishop
ask
a
man
of
his
age
to
turn
schoolmaster
to
a
pack
of
children
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Out
of
the
question
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
laughing
slightly
;
"
of
course
no
such
demand
shall
be
made
on
your
father
.
<EOS>
I
can
at
any
rate
promise
you
that
I
will
not
be
the
medium
of
any
so
absurd
a
requisition
.
<EOS>
We
wished
your
father
to
preach
in
the
hospital
,
as
the
inmates
may
naturally
be
too
old
to
leave
it
,
but
even
that
shall
not
be
insisted
on
.
<EOS>
We
wished
also
to
attach
a
Sabbath
-
day
school
to
the
hospital
,
thinking
that
such
an
establishment
could
not
but
be
useful
under
the
surveillance
of
so
good
a
clergyman
as
Mr.
Harding
,
and
also
under
your
own
.
<EOS>
But
,
dear
Mrs.
Bold
,
we
wo
n't
talk
of
these
things
now
.
<EOS>
One
thing
is
clear
:
we
must
do
what
we
can
to
annul
this
rash
offer
the
bishop
has
made
to
Mr.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
Your
father
would
n't
see
Quiverful
,
would
he
?
<EOS>
Quiverful
is
an
honourable
man
,
and
would
not
for
a
moment
stand
in
your
father
's
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
said
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
Ask
a
man
with
fourteen
children
to
give
up
his
preferment
!
<EOS>
I
am
quite
sure
he
will
do
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
,
"
said
Slope
,
and
he
again
drew
near
to
Mrs.
Bold
,
so
that
now
they
were
very
close
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
did
not
think
much
about
it
but
instinctively
moved
away
a
little
.
<EOS>
How
greatly
would
she
have
increased
the
distance
<EOS>
could
she
have
guessed
what
had
been
said
about
her
at
Plumstead
!
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
out
of
the
question
that
Quiverful
should
supersede
your
father
 
quite
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
has
been
too
rash
.
<EOS>
An
idea
occurs
to
me
which
may
perhaps
,
with
God
's
blessing
,
put
us
right
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Mrs.
Bold
,
would
you
object
to
seeing
the
bishop
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
not
my
father
see
him
?
"
said
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
She
had
once
before
in
her
life
interfered
in
her
father
's
affairs
,
and
then
not
to
much
advantage
.
<EOS>
She
was
older
now
and
felt
that
she
should
take
no
step
in
a
matter
so
vital
to
him
without
his
consent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
with
a
look
of
sorrow
,
as
though
he
greatly
bewailed
the
want
of
charity
in
his
patron
,
"
the
bishop
fancies
that
he
has
cause
of
anger
against
your
father
.
<EOS>
I
fear
an
interview
would
lead
to
further
ill
-
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
"
<EOS>
my
father
is
the
mildest
,
the
gentlest
man
living
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
know
,
"
said
Slope
,
"
that
he
has
the
best
of
daughters
.
<EOS>
So
you
would
not
see
the
bishop
?
<EOS>
As
to
getting
an
interview
,
I
could
manage
that
for
you
without
the
slightest
annoyance
to
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
do
nothing
,
Mr.
Slope
,
without
consulting
my
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
he
,
"
that
would
be
useless
;
you
would
then
only
be
your
father
's
messenger
.
<EOS>
Does
anything
occur
to
yourself
?
<EOS>
Something
must
be
done
.
<EOS>
Your
father
shall
not
be
ruined
by
so
ridiculous
a
misunderstanding
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
said
that
nothing
occurred
to
her
,
but
that
it
was
very
hard
;
the
tears
came
to
her
eyes
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
would
have
given
much
to
have
had
the
privilege
of
drying
them
,
but
he
had
tact
enough
to
know
that
he
had
still
a
great
deal
to
do
before
he
could
even
hope
for
any
privilege
with
Mrs.
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
cuts
me
to
the
heart
to
see
you
so
grieved
,
"
said
he
.
"
<EOS>
But
pray
let
me
assure
you
that
your
father
's
interests
shall
not
be
sacrificed
if
it
be
possible
for
me
to
protect
them
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
the
bishop
openly
what
are
the
facts
.
<EOS>
I
will
explain
to
him
that
he
has
hardly
the
right
to
appoint
any
other
than
your
father
,
and
will
show
him
that
if
he
does
so
he
will
be
guilty
of
great
injustice
 
<EOS>
and
you
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
you
will
have
the
charity
at
any
rate
to
believe
this
of
me
,
that
I
am
truly
anxious
for
your
father
's
welfare
 
for
his
and
for
your
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
widow
hardly
knew
what
answer
to
make
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
aware
that
her
father
would
not
be
at
all
thankful
to
Mr.
Slope
;
she
had
a
strong
wish
to
share
her
father
's
feelings
;
and
yet
she
could
not
but
acknowledge
that
Mr.
Slope
was
very
kind
.
<EOS>
Her
father
,
who
was
generally
so
charitable
to
all
men
,
who
seldom
spoke
ill
of
anyone
,
had
warned
her
against
Mr.
Slope
,
and
yet
she
did
not
know
how
to
abstain
from
thanking
him
.
<EOS>
What
interest
could
he
have
in
the
matter
but
that
which
he
professed
?
<EOS>
Nevertheless
there
was
that
in
his
manner
which
even
she
distrusted
.
<EOS>
She
felt
,
she
did
not
know
why
,
that
there
was
something
about
him
which
ought
to
put
her
on
her
guard
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
read
all
this
in
her
hesitating
manner
just
as
plainly
as
though
she
had
opened
her
heart
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
talent
of
the
man
that
he
could
so
read
the
inward
feelings
of
women
with
whom
he
conversed
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
Eleanor
was
doubting
him
,
and
that
,
if
she
thanked
him
,
she
would
only
do
so
because
she
could
not
help
it
,
but
yet
this
did
not
make
him
angry
or
even
annoy
him
.
<EOS>
Rome
was
not
built
in
a
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
come
for
thanks
,
"
continued
he
,
seeing
her
hesitation
,
"
and
do
not
want
them
 
at
any
rate
before
they
are
merited
.
<EOS>
But
this
I
do
want
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
that
I
may
make
to
myself
friends
in
this
fold
to
which
it
has
pleased
God
to
call
me
as
one
of
the
humblest
of
his
shepherds
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
not
do
so
,
my
task
here
must
indeed
be
a
sad
one
.
<EOS>
I
will
at
any
rate
endeavour
to
deserve
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
,
"
said
she
,
"
you
will
soon
make
plenty
of
friends
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
felt
herself
obliged
to
say
something
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
will
be
nothing
unless
they
are
such
as
will
sympathize
with
my
feelings
;
unless
they
are
such
as
I
can
reverence
and
admire
 
and
love
.
<EOS>
If
the
best
and
purest
turn
away
from
me
,
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
be
satisfied
with
the
friendship
of
the
less
estimable
.
<EOS>
In
such
case
I
must
live
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
'm
sure
you
will
not
do
that
,
Mr.
Slope
.
"
<EOS>
Eleanor
meant
nothing
,
but
it
suited
him
to
appear
to
think
some
special
allusion
had
been
intended
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
I
shall
live
alone
,
quite
alone
as
far
as
the
heart
is
concerned
,
if
those
with
whom
I
yearn
to
ally
myself
turn
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
But
enough
of
this
;
I
have
called
you
my
friend
,
and
I
hope
you
will
not
contradict
me
.
<EOS>
I
trust
the
time
may
come
when
I
may
also
call
your
father
so
.
<EOS>
May
God
bless
you
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
you
and
your
darling
boy
.
<EOS>
And
tell
your
father
from
me
that
what
can
be
done
for
his
interest
shall
be
done
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
he
took
his
leave
,
pressing
the
widow
's
hand
rather
more
closely
than
usual
.
<EOS>
Circumstances
,
however
,
seemed
just
then
to
make
this
intelligible
,
and
the
lady
did
not
feel
called
on
to
resent
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
understand
him
,
"
said
Eleanor
to
Mary
Bold
a
few
minutes
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
whether
he
is
a
good
man
or
a
bad
man
 
whether
he
is
true
or
false
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
give
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
and
believe
the
best
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
whole
,
I
think
I
do
,
"
said
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
do
believe
that
he
means
well
 
<EOS>
and
if
so
,
it
is
a
shame
that
we
should
revile
him
and
make
him
miserable
while
he
is
among
us
.
<EOS>
But
,
oh
,
Mary
,
I
fear
Papa
will
be
disappointed
in
the
hospital
.
"
   
<EOS>
Who
Shall
Be
Cock
of
the
Walk
?
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
things
were
going
somewhat
uneasily
at
the
palace
.
<EOS>
The
hint
or
two
which
Mr.
Slope
had
given
was
by
no
means
thrown
away
upon
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
feeling
that
if
he
ever
meant
to
oppose
the
now
almost
unendurable
despotism
of
his
wife
,
he
must
lose
no
further
time
in
doing
so
;
that
if
he
ever
meant
to
be
himself
master
in
his
own
diocese
,
let
alone
his
own
house
,
he
should
begin
at
once
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
easier
to
have
done
so
from
the
day
of
his
consecration
than
now
,
but
easier
now
than
when
Mrs.
Proudie
should
have
succeeded
in
thoroughly
mastering
the
diocesan
details
.
<EOS>
Then
the
proffered
assistance
of
Mr.
Slope
was
a
great
thing
for
him
,
a
most
unexpected
and
invaluable
aid
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
had
looked
on
the
two
as
allied
forces
and
had
considered
that
,
as
allies
,
they
were
impregnable
.
<EOS>
He
had
begun
to
believe
that
his
only
chance
of
escape
would
be
by
the
advancement
of
Mr.
Slope
to
some
distant
and
rich
preferment
.
<EOS>
But
now
it
seemed
that
one
of
his
enemies
,
certainly
the
least
potent
of
them
,
but
nevertheless
one
very
important
,
was
willing
to
desert
his
own
camp
.
<EOS>
Assisted
by
Mr.
Slope
what
might
he
not
do
?
<EOS>
He
walked
up
and
down
his
little
study
,
almost
thinking
that
the
time
might
come
when
he
would
be
able
to
appropriate
to
his
own
use
the
big
room
upstairs
in
which
his
predecessor
had
always
sat
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
revolved
these
things
in
his
mind
a
note
was
brought
to
him
from
Archdeacon
<EOS>
Grantly
,
in
which
that
divine
begged
his
lordship
to
do
him
the
honour
of
seeing
him
on
the
morrow
 
<EOS>
would
his
lordship
have
the
kindness
to
name
an
hour
?
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
's
proposed
visit
would
have
reference
to
the
reappointment
of
Mr.
Harding
to
the
wardenship
of
Barchester
Hospital
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
having
read
his
note
was
informed
that
the
archdeacon
's
servant
was
waiting
for
an
answer
.
  
<EOS>
Here
at
once
a
great
opportunity
offered
itself
to
the
bishop
of
acting
on
his
own
responsibility
.
<EOS>
He
bethought
himself
however
of
his
new
ally
and
rang
the
bell
for
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
It
turned
out
that
Mr.
Slope
was
not
in
the
house
,
and
then
,
greatly
daring
,
the
bishop
with
his
own
unassisted
spirit
wrote
a
note
to
the
archdeacon
saying
that
he
would
see
him
,
and
naming
an
hour
for
doing
so
.
<EOS>
Having
watched
from
his
study
-
window
that
the
messenger
got
safely
off
from
the
premises
with
this
dispatch
,
he
began
to
turn
over
in
his
mind
<EOS>
what
step
he
should
next
take
.
  
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
he
would
have
to
declare
to
the
archdeacon
either
that
Mr.
Harding
should
have
the
appointment
,
or
that
he
should
not
have
it
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
felt
that
he
could
not
honestly
throw
over
the
Quiverfuls
without
informing
Mrs.
Proudie
,
and
he
resolved
at
last
to
brave
the
lioness
in
her
den
and
tell
her
that
circumstances
were
such
that
it
behoved
him
to
reappoint
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
feel
that
he
should
at
all
derogate
from
his
new
courage
by
promising
Mrs.
Proudie
that
the
very
first
piece
of
available
preferment
at
his
disposal
should
be
given
to
Quiverful
to
atone
for
the
injury
done
to
him
.
<EOS>
If
he
could
mollify
the
lioness
with
such
a
sop
,
how
happy
would
he
think
his
first
efforts
to
have
been
!
  
<EOS>
Not
without
many
misgivings
did
he
find
himself
in
Mrs.
Proudie
's
boudoir
.
<EOS>
He
had
at
first
thought
of
sending
for
her
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
at
all
impossible
that
she
might
choose
to
take
such
a
message
amiss
,
and
then
also
it
might
be
some
protection
to
him
to
have
his
daughters
present
at
the
interview
.
<EOS>
He
found
her
sitting
with
her
account
-
books
before
her
,
nibbling
the
end
of
her
pencil
,
evidently
immersed
in
pecuniary
difficulties
,
and
harassed
in
mind
by
the
multiplicity
of
palatial
expenses
and
the
heavy
cost
of
episcopal
grandeur
.
<EOS>
Her
daughters
were
around
her
.
<EOS>
Olivia
was
reading
a
novel
,
Augusta
was
crossing
a
note
to
her
bosom
friend
in
Baker
Street
,
and
Netta
was
working
diminutive
coach
wheels
for
the
bottom
of
a
petticoat
.
<EOS>
If
the
bishop
could
get
the
better
of
his
wife
in
her
present
mood
,
he
would
be
a
man
indeed
.
<EOS>
He
might
then
consider
the
victory
his
own
forever
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
in
such
cases
the
matter
between
husband
and
wife
stands
much
the
same
as
it
does
between
two
boys
at
the
same
school
,
two
cocks
in
the
same
yard
,
or
two
armies
on
the
same
continent
.
<EOS>
The
conqueror
once
is
generally
the
conqueror
forever
after
.
<EOS>
The
prestige
of
victory
is
everything
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ahem
 
<EOS>
my
dear
<EOS>
,
"
began
the
bishop
,
"
if
you
are
disengaged
,
I
wished
to
speak
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
put
her
pencil
down
carefully
at
the
point
to
which
she
had
totted
her
figures
,
marked
down
in
her
memory
<EOS>
the
sum
she
had
arrived
at
,
and
then
looked
up
,
sourly
enough
,
into
her
helpmate
's
face
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
busy
,
another
time
will
do
as
well
,
"
continued
the
bishop
,
whose
courage
,
like
Bob
Acres
"
,
had
oozed
out
now
that
he
found
himself
on
the
ground
of
battle
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
about
,
Bishop
?
"
asked
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
 
it
was
about
those
Quiverfuls
 
<EOS>
but
I
see
you
are
engaged
.
<EOS>
Another
time
will
do
just
as
well
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
about
the
Quiverfuls
?
<EOS>
It
is
quite
understood
,
I
believe
,
that
they
are
to
come
to
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
There
is
to
be
no
doubt
about
that
,
is
there
?
"
<EOS>
and
as
she
spoke
she
kept
her
pencil
sternly
and
vigorously
fixed
on
the
column
of
figures
before
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
,
there
is
a
difficulty
,
"
said
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
difficulty
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
,
"
what
difficulty
?
<EOS>
The
place
has
been
promised
to
Mr.
Quiverful
,
and
of
course
he
must
have
it
.
<EOS>
He
has
made
all
his
arrangements
.
<EOS>
He
has
written
for
a
curate
for
Puddingdale
,
he
has
spoken
to
the
auctioneer
about
selling
his
farm
,
horses
,
and
cows
,
and
in
all
respects
considers
the
place
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
must
have
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
Bishop
,
look
well
to
thyself
and
call
up
all
the
manhood
that
is
in
thee
.
<EOS>
Think
how
much
is
at
stake
.
<EOS>
If
now
thou
art
not
true
to
thy
guns
,
no
Slope
can
hereafter
aid
thee
.
<EOS>
How
can
he
who
deserts
his
own
colours
at
the
first
smell
of
gunpowder
expect
faith
in
any
ally
?
<EOS>
Thou
thyself
hast
sought
the
battle
-
field
:
fight
out
the
battle
manfully
now
thou
art
there
.
<EOS>
Courage
,
Bishop
,
courage
!
<EOS>
Frowns
can
not
kill
,
nor
can
sharp
words
break
any
bones
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
the
apron
is
thine
own
.
<EOS>
She
can
appoint
no
wardens
,
give
away
no
benefices
,
nominate
no
chaplains
,
an
'
thou
art
but
true
to
thyself
.
<EOS>
Up
,
man
,
and
at
her
with
a
constant
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Some
little
monitor
within
the
bishop
's
breast
so
addressed
him
.
<EOS>
But
then
there
was
another
monitor
there
which
advised
him
differently
,
and
as
follows
.
<EOS>
Remember
,
Bishop
,
she
is
a
woman
,
and
such
a
woman
too
as
thou
<EOS>
well
knowest
:
<EOS>
a
battle
of
words
with
such
a
woman
is
the
very
mischief
.
<EOS>
Were
it
not
better
for
thee
to
carry
on
this
war
,
if
it
must
be
waged
,
from
behind
thine
own
table
in
thine
own
study
?
<EOS>
Does
not
every
cock
fight
best
on
his
own
dunghill
?
<EOS>
Thy
daughters
also
are
here
,
the
pledges
of
thy
love
,
the
fruits
of
thy
loins
:
is
it
well
that
they
should
see
thee
in
the
hour
of
thy
victory
over
their
mother
?
<EOS>
Nay
,
is
it
well
that
they
should
see
thee
in
the
possible
hour
of
thy
defeat
?
<EOS>
Besides
,
hast
thou
not
chosen
thy
opportunity
with
wonderful
little
skill
,
indeed
with
no
touch
of
that
sagacity
for
which
thou
art
famous
?
<EOS>
Will
it
not
turn
out
that
thou
art
wrong
in
this
matter
and
thine
enemy
right
;
that
thou
hast
actually
pledged
thyself
in
this
matter
of
the
hospital
,
and
that
now
thou
wouldest
turn
upon
thy
wife
because
she
requires
from
thee
but
the
fulfilment
of
thy
promise
?
<EOS>
Art
thou
not
a
Christian
bishop
,
and
is
not
thy
word
to
be
held
sacred
<EOS>
whatever
be
the
result
?
<EOS>
Return
,
Bishop
,
to
thy
sanctum
on
the
lower
floor
and
postpone
thy
combative
propensities
for
some
occasion
in
which
at
least
thou
mayest
fight
the
battle
against
odds
less
tremendously
against
thee
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
passed
within
the
bishop
's
bosom
while
Mrs.
Proudie
still
sat
with
her
fixed
pencil
,
and
the
figures
of
her
sum
still
enduring
on
the
tablets
of
her
memory
.

she
said

"
Of

Mr.
Quiverful

she
said
out
loud
to
her
lord
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
I
merely
wanted
to
suggest
to
you
that
Mr.
Slope
seems
to
think
that
if
Mr.
Harding
be
not
appointed
,
public
feeling
in
the
matter
would
be
against
us
,
and
that
the
press
might
perhaps
take
it
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slope
seems
to
think
!
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
plainly
showed
the
bishop
that
he
was
right
in
looking
for
a
breach
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
has
Mr.
Slope
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
I
hope
,
my
lord
,
you
are
not
going
to
allow
yourself
to
be
governed
by
a
chaplain
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
in
her
eagerness
the
lady
lost
her
place
in
her
account
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Nothing
I
can
assure
you
is
less
probable
.
<EOS>
But
still
,
Mr.
Slope
may
be
useful
in
finding
how
the
wind
blows
,
and
I
really
thought
that
if
we
could
give
something
else
as
good
to
the
Quiverfuls
 
"
  
"
Nonsense
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
;
"
it
would
be
years
before
you
could
give
them
anything
else
that
could
suit
them
half
as
well
,
and
as
for
the
press
and
the
public
and
all
that
,
remember
there
are
two
ways
of
telling
a
story
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Harding
is
fool
enough
to
tell
his
tale
,
we
can
also
tell
ours
.
<EOS>
The
place
was
offered
to
him
,
and
he
refused
it
.
<EOS>
It
has
now
been
given
to
someone
else
,
and
there
's
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
At
least
I
should
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
I
rather
believe
you
are
right
,
"
said
the
bishop
,
and
sneaking
out
of
the
room
<EOS>
,
he
went
downstairs
,
troubled
in
his
mind
as
to
how
he
should
receive
the
archdeacon
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
felt
himself
not
very
well
just
at
present
,
and
began
to
consider
that
he
might
,
not
improbably
,
be
detained
in
his
room
the
next
morning
by
an
attack
of
bile
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
unfortunately
,
very
subject
to
bilious
annoyances
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slope
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
'll
Slope
him
,
"
said
the
indignant
matron
to
her
listening
progeny
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
has
come
to
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
thinks
he
is
to
be
Bishop
of
Barchester
himself
,
because
I
've
taken
him
by
the
hand
and
got
your
father
to
make
him
his
domestic
chaplain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
always
full
of
impudence
,
"
said
Olivia
;
"
I
told
you
<EOS>
so
once
before
,
Mamma
.
<EOS>
"
Olivia
,
however
,
had
not
thought
him
too
impudent
when
once
before
he
had
proposed
to
make
her
Mrs.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Olivia
,
I
always
thought
you
liked
him
,
"
said
Augusta
,
who
at
that
moment
had
some
grudge
against
her
sister
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
disliked
the
man
,
because
I
think
him
thoroughly
vulgar
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
you
're
wrong
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
;
"
he
's
not
vulgar
at
all
;
and
what
is
more
,
he
is
a
soul
-
stirring
,
eloquent
preacher
;
but
he
must
be
taught
to
know
his
place
if
he
is
to
remain
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
the
horridest
eyes
I
ever
saw
in
a
man
's
head
,
"
said
Netta
;
"
and
I
tell
you
what
,
he
's
terribly
greedy
;
did
you
see
all
the
currant
pie
he
ate
yesterday
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Slope
got
home
he
soon
learnt
from
the
bishop
,
as
much
from
his
manner
as
his
words
,
that
Mrs.
Proudie
's
behests
in
the
matter
of
the
hospital
were
to
be
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
let
fall
something
as
to
"
this
occasion
only
"
and
"
keeping
all
affairs
about
patronage
exclusively
in
his
own
hands
.
"
<EOS>
But
he
was
quite
decided
about
Mr.
Harding
;
and
as
Mr.
Slope
did
not
wish
to
have
both
the
prelate
and
the
prelatess
against
him
,
he
did
not
at
present
see
that
he
could
do
anything
but
yield
.
  
<EOS>
He
merely
remarked
that
he
would
of
course
carry
out
the
bishop
's
views
and
that
he
was
quite
sure
that
if
the
bishop
trusted
to
his
own
judgement
things
in
the
diocese
would
certainly
be
well
ordered
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
knew
that
if
you
hit
a
nail
on
the
head
often
enough
,
it
will
penetrate
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
sitting
alone
in
his
room
on
the
same
evening
when
a
light
knock
was
made
on
his
door
,
and
before
he
could
answer
it
<EOS>
the
door
was
opened
,
and
his
patroness
appeared
.
<EOS>
He
was
all
smiles
in
a
moment
,
but
so
was
not
she
also
.
<EOS>
She
took
,
however
,
the
chair
that
was
offered
to
her
,
and
thus
began
her
expostulation
:
  
"
Mr.
Slope
,
I
did
not
at
all
approve
your
conduct
the
other
night
with
that
Italian
woman
.
<EOS>
Anyone
would
have
thought
that
you
were
her
lover
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
,
my
dear
madam
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
with
a
look
of
horror
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
she
is
a
married
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
more
than
I
know
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
;
"
however
she
chooses
to
pass
for
such
.
<EOS>
But
married
or
not
married
,
such
attention
as
you
paid
to
her
was
improper
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
believe
that
you
would
wish
to
give
offence
in
my
drawing
-
room
,
Mr.
Slope
,
but
I
owe
it
to
myself
and
my
daughters
to
tell
you
that
I
disapprove
of
your
conduct
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
opened
wide
his
huge
protruding
eyes
and
stared
out
of
them
with
a
look
of
well
-
feigned
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mrs.
Proudie
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
did
but
fetch
her
something
to
eat
when
she
said
she
was
hungry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
called
on
her
since
,
"
continued
she
,
looking
at
the
culprit
with
the
stern
look
of
a
detective
policeman
in
the
act
of
declaring
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
turned
over
in
his
mind
whether
it
would
be
well
for
him
to
tell
this
termagant
at
once
that
he
should
call
on
whom
he
liked
and
do
what
he
liked
,
but
he
remembered
that
his
footing
in
Barchester
was
not
yet
sufficiently
firm
,
and
that
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
pacify
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
called
since
at
Dr.
Stanhope
's
house
,
and
certainly
saw
Madame
Neroni
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
you
saw
her
alone
,
"
said
the
episcopal
Argus
.
  
<EOS>
"
Undoubtedly
,
I
did
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
"
but
that
was
because
nobody
else
happened
to
be
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
Surely
it
was
no
fault
of
mine
if
the
rest
of
the
family
were
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
,
but
I
assure
you
,
Mr.
Slope
,
you
will
fall
greatly
in
my
estimation
if
I
find
that
you
allow
yourself
to
be
caught
by
the
lures
of
that
woman
.
<EOS>
I
know
women
better
than
you
do
,
Mr.
Slope
,
and
you
may
believe
me
that
that
signora
,
as
she
calls
herself
,
is
not
a
fitting
companion
for
a
strict
evangelical
unmarried
young
clergyman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
How
Mr.
Slope
would
have
liked
to
laugh
at
her
,
had
he
dared
!
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
dare
.
<EOS>
So
he
merely
said
,
"
I
can
assure
you
,
Mrs.
Proudie
,
the
lady
in
question
is
nothing
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
hope
not
,
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
considered
it
my
duty
to
give
you
this
caution
.
<EOS>
And
now
there
is
another
thing
I
feel
myself
called
on
to
speak
about
:
it
is
your
conduct
to
the
bishop
,
Mr.
Slope
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
conduct
to
the
bishop
,
"
said
he
,
now
truly
surprised
and
ignorant
what
the
lady
alluded
to
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr.
Slope
,
your
conduct
to
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
It
is
by
no
means
what
I
would
wish
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
the
bishop
said
anything
,
Mrs.
Proudie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
the
bishop
has
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
probably
thinks
that
any
remarks
on
the
matter
will
come
better
from
me
,
who
first
introduced
you
to
his
lordship
's
notice
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
Mr.
Slope
,
you
are
a
little
inclined
to
take
too
much
upon
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
An
angry
spot
showed
itself
on
Mr.
Slope
's
cheeks
,
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
controlled
himself
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
do
so
,
and
sat
quite
silent
while
the
lady
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
fault
of
many
young
men
in
your
position
,
and
therefore
the
bishop
is
not
inclined
at
present
to
resent
it
.
<EOS>
You
will
,
no
doubt
,
soon
learn
what
is
required
from
you
and
what
is
not
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
take
my
advice
,
however
,
you
will
be
careful
not
to
obtrude
advice
upon
the
bishop
in
any
matter
touching
patronage
.
<EOS>
If
his
lordship
wants
advice
,
he
knows
where
to
look
for
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
having
added
to
her
counsel
a
string
of
platitudes
as
to
what
was
desirable
and
what
not
desirable
in
the
conduct
of
a
strictly
evangelical
unmarried
young
clergyman
,
Mrs.
Proudie
retreated
,
leaving
the
chaplain
to
his
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
The
upshot
of
his
thoughts
was
this
,
that
there
certainly
was
not
room
in
the
diocese
for
the
energies
of
both
himself
and
Mrs.
Proudie
,
and
that
it
behoved
him
quickly
to
ascertain
whether
his
energies
or
hers
were
to
prevail
.
   
<EOS>
The
Widow
's
Persecution
 
Early
on
the
following
morning
Mr.
Slope
was
summoned
to
the
bishop
's
dressing
-
room
,
and
went
there
fully
expecting
that
he
should
find
his
lordship
very
indignant
and
spirited
up
by
his
wife
to
repeat
the
rebuke
which
she
had
administered
on
the
previous
day
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
resolved
that
at
any
rate
from
him
he
would
not
stand
it
,
and
entered
the
dressing
-
room
in
rather
a
combative
disposition
;
but
he
found
the
bishop
in
the
most
placid
and
gentlest
of
humours
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
complained
of
being
rather
unwell
,
had
a
slight
headache
,
and
was
not
quite
the
thing
in
his
stomach
;
but
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
his
temper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Slope
,
"
said
he
,
taking
the
chaplain
's
proffered
hand
,
"
Archdeacon
Grantly
is
to
call
on
me
this
morning
,
and
I
really
am
not
fit
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
I
fear
I
must
trouble
you
to
see
him
for
me
;
"
and
then
Dr.
Proudie
proceeded
to
explain
what
it
was
that
must
be
said
to
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
be
told
in
fact
,
in
the
civilest
words
in
which
the
tidings
could
be
conveyed
,
that
Mr.
Harding
having
refused
the
wardenship
,
the
appointment
had
been
offered
to
Mr.
Quiverful
and
accepted
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
again
pointed
out
to
his
patron
that
he
thought
he
was
perhaps
not
quite
wise
in
his
decision
,
and
this
<EOS>
he
did
_
sotto
<EOS>
voce
_
.
<EOS>
But
even
with
this
precaution
it
was
not
safe
to
say
much
,
and
during
the
little
that
he
did
say
,
the
bishop
made
a
very
slight
,
but
still
a
very
ominous
gesture
with
his
thumb
towards
the
door
which
opened
from
his
dressing
-
room
to
some
inner
sanctuary
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
at
once
took
the
hint
and
said
no
more
,
but
he
perceived
that
there
was
to
be
confidence
between
him
and
his
patron
,
that
the
league
desired
by
him
was
to
be
made
,
and
that
this
appointment
of
Mr.
Quiverful
was
to
be
the
last
sacrifice
offered
on
the
altar
of
conjugal
obedience
.
<EOS>
All
this
Mr.
Slope
read
in
the
slight
motion
of
the
bishop
's
thumb
,
and
he
read
it
correctly
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
need
of
parchments
and
seals
,
of
attestations
,
explanations
,
and
professions
.
<EOS>
The
bargain
was
understood
between
them
,
and
Mr.
Slope
gave
the
bishop
his
hand
upon
it
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
understood
the
little
extra
squeeze
,
and
an
intelligible
gleam
of
assent
twinkled
in
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
be
civil
to
the
archdeacon
,
Mr.
Slope
,
"
said
he
out
loud
,
"
but
make
him
quite
understand
that
in
this
matter
Mr.
Harding
has
put
it
out
of
my
power
to
oblige
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
calumny
on
Mrs.
Proudie
to
suggest
that
she
was
sitting
in
her
bedroom
with
her
ear
at
the
keyhole
during
this
interview
.
<EOS>
She
had
within
her
a
spirit
of
decorum
which
prevented
her
from
descending
to
such
baseness
.
<EOS>
To
put
her
ear
to
a
keyhole
,
or
to
listen
at
a
chink
,
was
a
trick
for
a
housemaid
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
knew
this
,
and
therefore
did
not
do
it
;
but
she
stationed
herself
as
near
to
the
door
as
she
well
could
,
that
she
might
,
if
possible
,
get
the
advantage
which
the
housemaid
would
have
had
,
without
descending
to
the
housemaid
's
artifice
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
little
,
however
,
that
she
heard
,
and
that
little
was
only
sufficient
to
deceive
her
.
<EOS>
She
saw
nothing
of
that
friendly
pressure
,
perceived
nothing
of
that
concluded
bargain
;
she
did
not
even
dream
of
the
treacherous
resolves
which
those
two
false
men
had
made
together
to
upset
her
in
the
pride
of
her
station
,
to
dash
the
cup
from
her
lip
before
she
had
drunk
of
it
,
to
sweep
away
all
her
power
before
she
had
tasted
its
sweets
!
<EOS>
Traitors
that
they
were
,
the
husband
of
her
bosom
and
the
outcast
whom
she
had
fostered
and
brought
to
the
warmth
of
the
world
's
brightest
fireside
!
<EOS>
But
neither
of
them
had
the
magnanimity
of
this
woman
.
<EOS>
Though
two
men
have
thus
leagued
themselves
together
against
her
,
even
yet
the
battle
is
not
lost
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
felt
pretty
sure
that
Dr.
Grantly
would
decline
the
honour
of
seeing
him
,
and
such
turned
out
to
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
,
when
the
palace
door
was
opened
to
him
,
was
greeted
by
a
note
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
presented
his
compliments
,
&
c.
&
<EOS>
c.
The
bishop
was
ill
in
his
room
and
very
greatly
regretted
,
&
c.
&
<EOS>
c.
Mr.
Slope
had
been
charged
with
the
bishop
's
views
,
and
if
agreeable
to
the
archdeacon
,
would
do
himself
the
honour
,
&
c.
&
c.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
,
however
,
was
not
agreeable
,
and
having
read
his
note
in
the
hall
,
crumpled
it
up
in
his
hand
,
and
muttering
something
about
sorrow
for
his
lordship
's
illness
,
took
his
leave
,
without
sending
as
much
as
a
verbal
message
in
answer
to
Mr.
Slope
's
note
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ill
!
"
said
the
archdeacon
to
himself
as
he
flung
himself
into
his
brougham
.
<EOS>
"
The
man
is
absolutely
a
coward
.
<EOS>
He
is
afraid
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
Ill
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
was
never
ill
himself
,
and
did
not
therefore
understand
that
anyone
else
could
in
truth
be
prevented
by
illness
from
keeping
an
appointment
.
<EOS>
He
regarded
all
such
excuses
as
subterfuges
,
and
in
the
present
instance
he
was
not
far
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
desired
to
be
driven
to
his
father
-
in
-
law
's
lodgings
in
the
High
Street
,
and
hearing
from
the
servant
that
Mr.
Harding
was
at
his
daughter
's
,
followed
him
to
Mrs.
Bold
's
house
,
and
there
found
him
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
was
fuming
with
rage
when
he
got
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
had
by
this
time
nearly
forgotten
the
pusillanimity
of
the
bishop
in
the
villainy
of
the
chaplain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
at
that
,
"
said
he
,
throwing
Mr.
Slope
's
crumpled
note
to
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
to
be
told
that
if
I
choose
I
may
have
the
honour
of
seeing
Mr.
Slope
,
and
that
too
after
a
positive
engagement
with
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
says
the
bishop
is
ill
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
you
are
deceived
by
such
an
excuse
as
that
.
<EOS>
He
was
well
enough
yesterday
.
<EOS>
Now
I
tell
you
what
,
I
will
see
the
bishop
,
and
I
will
tell
him
also
very
plainly
what
I
think
of
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
I
will
see
him
,
or
else
Barchester
will
soon
be
too
hot
to
hold
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
was
sitting
in
the
room
,
but
Dr.
Grantly
had
hardly
noticed
her
in
his
anger
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
now
said
to
him
with
the
greatest
innocence
,
"
I
wish
you
had
seen
Mr.
Slope
,
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
,
because
I
think
perhaps
it
might
have
done
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
turned
on
her
with
almost
brutal
wrath
.
<EOS>
Had
she
at
once
owned
that
she
had
accepted
Mr.
Slope
for
her
second
husband
<EOS>
,
he
could
hardly
have
felt
more
convinced
of
her
belonging
body
and
soul
to
the
Slope
and
Proudie
party
than
he
now
did
on
hearing
her
express
such
a
wish
as
this
.
<EOS>
Poor
Eleanor
!
  
<EOS>
"
See
him
!
"
said
the
archdeacon
glaring
at
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
why
am
I
to
be
called
on
to
lower
myself
in
the
world
's
esteem
and
my
own
by
coming
in
contact
with
such
a
man
as
that
?
<EOS>
I
have
hitherto
lived
among
gentlemen
,
and
do
not
mean
to
be
dragged
into
other
company
by
anybody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Harding
well
knew
what
the
archdeacon
meant
,
but
Eleanor
was
as
innocent
as
her
own
baby
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
understand
how
the
archdeacon
could
consider
himself
to
be
dragged
into
bad
company
by
condescending
to
speak
to
Mr.
Slope
for
a
few
minutes
when
the
interests
of
her
father
might
be
served
by
his
doing
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
talking
for
a
full
hour
yesterday
to
Mr.
Slope
,
"
said
she
with
some
little
assumption
of
dignity
,
"
and
I
did
not
find
myself
lowered
by
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Perhaps
not
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
if
you
'll
be
good
enough
to
allow
me
,
I
shall
judge
for
myself
in
such
matters
.
<EOS>
And
I
tell
you
what
,
Eleanor
;
it
will
be
much
better
for
you
if
you
will
allow
yourself
to
be
guided
also
by
the
advice
of
those
who
are
your
friends
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
not
,
you
will
be
apt
to
find
that
you
have
no
friends
left
who
can
advise
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
blushed
up
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
.
<EOS>
But
even
now
she
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
what
was
passing
in
the
archdeacon
's
mind
.
<EOS>
No
thought
of
love
-
making
or
love
-
receiving
had
yet
found
its
way
to
her
heart
since
the
death
of
poor
John
Bold
,
and
if
it
were
possible
that
such
a
thought
should
spring
there
,
the
man
must
be
far
different
from
Mr.
Slope
that
could
give
it
birth
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
Eleanor
blushed
deeply
,
for
she
felt
she
was
charged
with
improper
conduct
,
and
she
did
so
with
the
more
inward
pain
because
her
father
did
not
instantly
rally
to
her
side
 
<EOS>
that
father
for
whose
sake
and
love
she
had
submitted
to
be
the
receptacle
of
Mr.
Slope
's
confidence
.
<EOS>
She
had
given
a
detailed
account
of
all
that
had
passed
to
her
father
,
and
though
he
had
not
absolutely
agreed
with
her
about
Mr.
Slope
's
views
touching
the
hospital
,
yet
he
had
said
nothing
to
make
her
think
that
she
had
been
wrong
in
talking
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
far
too
angry
to
humble
herself
before
her
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
had
never
accustomed
herself
to
be
very
abject
before
him
,
and
they
had
never
been
confidential
allies
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
the
least
understand
what
you
mean
,
Dr.
Grantly
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
I
can
accuse
myself
of
doing
anything
that
my
friends
should
disapprove
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
called
here
expressly
to
ask
what
Papa
's
wishes
were
about
the
hospital
,
and
as
I
believe
he
called
with
friendly
intentions
,
I
told
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Friendly
intentions
!
"
sneered
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
greatly
wrong
Mr.
Slope
,
"
continued
Eleanor
,
"
but
I
have
explained
this
to
Papa
already
;
and
as
you
do
not
seem
to
approve
of
what
I
say
,
Dr.
Grantly
,
I
will
with
your
permission
leave
you
and
Papa
together
;
"
<EOS>
so
saying
,
she
walked
slowly
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
made
Mr.
Harding
very
unhappy
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
clear
that
the
archdeacon
and
his
wife
had
made
up
their
minds
that
Eleanor
was
going
to
marry
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
could
not
really
bring
himself
to
think
that
she
would
do
so
,
but
yet
he
could
not
deny
that
circumstances
made
it
appear
that
the
man
's
company
was
not
disagreeable
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
now
constantly
seeing
him
,
and
yet
she
received
visits
from
no
other
unmarried
gentleman
.
<EOS>
She
always
took
his
part
when
his
conduct
was
canvassed
,
although
she
was
aware
how
personally
objectionable
he
was
to
her
friends
.
<EOS>
Then
,
again
,
Mr.
Harding
felt
that
if
she
should
choose
to
become
Mrs.
Slope
,
he
had
nothing
that
he
could
justly
urge
against
her
doing
so
.
<EOS>
She
had
full
right
to
please
herself
,
and
he
,
as
a
father
,
could
not
say
that
she
would
disgrace
herself
by
marrying
a
clergyman
who
stood
so
well
before
the
world
as
Mr.
Slope
did
.
<EOS>
As
for
quarrelling
with
his
daughter
on
account
of
such
a
marriage
,
and
separating
himself
from
her
as
the
archdeacon
had
threatened
to
do
,
that
,
with
Mr.
Harding
,
would
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
If
she
should
determine
to
marry
this
man
,
he
must
get
over
his
aversion
as
best
he
could
.
<EOS>
His
Eleanor
,
his
own
old
companion
in
their
old
happy
home
,
must
still
be
the
friend
of
his
bosom
,
the
child
of
his
heart
.
<EOS>
Let
who
would
cast
her
off
,
he
would
not
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
fated
that
he
should
have
to
sit
in
his
old
age
at
the
same
table
with
that
man
whom
of
all
men
he
disliked
the
most
,
he
would
meet
his
fate
as
best
he
might
.
<EOS>
Anything
to
him
would
be
preferable
to
the
loss
of
his
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
Such
being
his
feelings
,
he
hardly
knew
how
to
take
part
with
Eleanor
against
the
archdeacon
,
or
with
the
archdeacon
against
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
said
that
he
should
never
have
suspected
her
.
 
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
he
never
should
have
done
so
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Harding
was
by
no
means
a
perfect
character
.
<EOS>
In
his
indecision
,
his
weakness
,
his
proneness
to
be
led
by
others
,
his
want
of
self
-
confidence
,
he
was
very
far
from
being
perfect
.
<EOS>
And
then
it
must
be
remembered
that
such
a
marriage
as
that
which
the
archdeacon
contemplated
with
disgust
,
which
we
who
know
Mr.
Slope
so
well
would
regard
with
equal
disgust
,
did
not
appear
so
monstrous
to
Mr.
Harding
because
in
his
charity
he
did
not
hate
the
chaplain
as
the
archdeacon
did
,
and
as
we
do
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
,
however
,
very
unhappy
when
his
daughter
left
the
room
,
and
he
had
recourse
to
an
old
trick
of
his
that
was
customary
to
him
in
his
times
of
sadness
.
<EOS>
He
began
playing
some
slow
tune
upon
an
imaginary
violoncello
,
drawing
one
hand
slowly
backwards
and
forwards
as
though
he
held
a
bow
in
it
,
and
modulating
the
unreal
chords
with
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
'll
marry
that
man
as
sure
as
two
and
two
make
four
,
"
said
the
practical
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
I
hope
not
,
"
said
the
father
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
she
does
,
what
can
I
say
to
her
?
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
object
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
right
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Dr.
Grantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
right
as
her
father
.
<EOS>
He
is
in
my
own
profession
and
,
for
aught
we
know
,
a
good
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
To
this
<EOS>
the
archdeacon
would
by
no
means
assent
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
well
,
however
,
to
argue
the
case
against
Eleanor
in
her
own
drawing
-
room
,
and
so
they
both
walked
forth
and
discussed
the
matter
in
all
its
bearings
under
the
elm
-
trees
of
the
close
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
also
explained
to
his
son
-
in
-
law
what
had
been
the
purport
,
at
any
rate
the
alleged
purport
,
of
Mr.
Slope
's
last
visit
to
the
widow
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
stated
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
that
Mr.
Slope
had
any
real
anxiety
such
as
that
he
had
pretended
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
forget
his
demeanour
to
myself
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
,
"
and
it
is
not
possible
that
his
ideas
should
have
changed
so
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
all
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
sly
_
tartuffe
_
!
<EOS>
He
thinks
to
buy
the
daughter
by
providing
for
the
father
.
<EOS>
He
means
to
show
how
powerful
he
is
,
how
good
he
is
,
and
how
much
he
is
willing
to
do
for
her
_
beaux
yeux
_
;
yes
,
I
see
it
all
now
.
<EOS>
But
we
'll
be
too
many
for
him
yet
,
Mr.
Harding
;
"
he
said
,
turning
to
his
companion
with
some
gravity
and
pressing
his
hand
upon
the
other
's
arm
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
,
perhaps
,
be
better
for
you
to
lose
the
hospital
than
get
it
on
such
terms
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lose
it
!
"
said
Mr.
Harding
;
"
why
I
've
lost
it
already
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
it
.
<EOS>
I
've
made
up
my
mind
to
do
without
it
.
<EOS>
I
'll
withdraw
altogether
.
<EOS>
I
'll
just
go
and
write
a
line
to
the
bishop
and
tell
him
that
I
withdraw
my
claim
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
Nothing
would
have
pleased
him
better
than
to
be
allowed
to
escape
from
the
trouble
and
difficulty
in
such
a
manner
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
now
going
too
fast
for
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
no
 
no
!
<EOS>
We
'll
do
no
such
thing
,
"
said
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
still
have
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
doubt
but
that
we
'll
have
it
.
<EOS>
But
not
by
Mr.
Slope
's
assistance
.
<EOS>
If
that
be
necessary
,
we
'll
lose
it
;
but
we
'll
have
it
,
spite
of
his
teeth
,
if
we
can
.
<EOS>
Arabin
will
be
at
Plumstead
to
-
morrow
;
you
must
come
over
and
talk
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
two
now
turned
into
the
cathedral
library
,
which
was
used
by
the
clergymen
of
the
close
as
a
sort
of
ecclesiastical
club
-
room
,
for
writing
sermons
and
sometimes
letters
;
also
for
reading
theological
works
and
sometimes
magazines
and
newspapers
.
<EOS>
The
theological
works
were
not
disturbed
,
perhaps
,
quite
as
often
as
from
the
appearance
of
the
building
the
outside
public
might
have
been
led
to
expect
.
<EOS>
Here
the
two
allies
settled
on
their
course
of
action
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
wrote
a
letter
to
the
bishop
,
strongly
worded
,
but
still
respectful
,
in
which
he
put
forward
his
father
-
in
-
law
's
claim
to
the
appointment
and
expressed
his
own
regret
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
see
his
lordship
when
he
called
.
<EOS>
Of
Mr.
Slope
he
made
no
mention
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
settled
that
Mr.
Harding
should
go
out
to
Plumstead
on
the
following
day
,
and
after
considerable
discussion
on
the
matter
the
archdeacon
proposed
to
ask
Eleanor
there
also
,
so
as
to
withdraw
her
,
if
possible
,
from
Mr.
Slope
's
attentions
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
week
or
two
,
"
said
he
,
"
may
teach
her
what
he
is
,
and
while
she
is
there
she
will
be
out
of
harm
's
way
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
wo
n't
come
there
after
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
was
not
a
little
surprised
when
her
brother
-
in
-
law
came
back
and
very
civilly
pressed
her
to
go
out
to
Plumstead
with
her
father
.
<EOS>
She
instantly
perceived
that
her
father
had
been
fighting
her
battles
for
her
behind
her
back
.
<EOS>
She
felt
thankful
to
him
,
and
for
his
sake
she
would
not
show
her
resentment
to
the
archdeacon
by
refusing
his
invitation
.
<EOS>
But
she
could
not
,
she
said
,
go
on
the
morrow
;
she
had
an
invitation
to
drink
tea
at
the
Stanhopes
,
which
she
had
promised
to
accept
.
<EOS>
She
would
,
she
added
,
go
with
her
father
on
the
next
day
,
if
he
would
wait
;
or
she
would
follow
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Stanhopes
!
"
said
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
know
you
were
so
intimate
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
know
it
myself
,
"
said
she
,
"
till
Miss
Stanhope
called
yesterday
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
like
her
very
much
,
and
I
have
promised
to
go
and
play
chess
with
some
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
they
a
party
there
?
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
still
fearful
of
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
"
said
Eleanor
;
"
Miss
Stanhope
said
there
was
to
be
nobody
at
all
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
heard
that
Mary
had
left
me
for
a
few
weeks
,
and
she
had
learnt
from
someone
that
I
play
chess
,
and
so
she
came
over
on
purpose
to
ask
me
to
go
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
that
's
very
friendly
,
"
said
the
ex
-
warden
.
<EOS>
"
They
certainly
do
look
more
like
foreigners
than
English
people
,
but
I
dare
say
they
are
none
the
worse
for
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
was
inclined
to
look
upon
the
Stanhopes
with
favourable
eyes
,
and
had
nothing
to
object
on
the
matter
.
<EOS>
It
was
therefore
arranged
that
Mr.
Harding
should
postpone
his
visit
to
Plumstead
for
one
day
and
then
take
with
him
Eleanor
,
the
baby
,
and
the
nurse
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
is
certainly
becoming
of
some
importance
in
Barchester
.

There
was
much
cause
for
grief
and
occasional
perturbation
of
spirits
in
the
Stanhope
family
,
but
yet
they
rarely
seemed
to
be
grieved
or
to
be
disturbed
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
peculiar
gift
of
each
of
them
that
each
was
able
to
bear
his
or
her
own
burden
without
complaint
,
and
perhaps
without
sympathy
.
<EOS>
They
habitually
looked
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
wall
,
if
there
was
a
gleam
on
either
side
for
them
to
look
at
;
if
there
was
none
,
they
endured
the
shade
with
an
indifference
which
,
if
not
stoical
,
answered
the
end
at
which
the
Stoics
aimed
.
<EOS>
Old
Stanhope
could
not
but
feel
that
he
had
ill
-
performed
his
duties
as
a
father
and
a
clergyman
,
and
could
hardly
look
forward
to
his
own
death
without
grief
at
the
position
in
which
he
would
leave
his
family
.
<EOS>
His
income
for
many
years
had
been
as
high
as
£
3,000
a
year
,
and
yet
they
had
among
them
no
other
provision
than
their
mother
's
fortune
of
£
10,000
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
only
spent
his
income
,
but
was
in
debt
.
<EOS>
Yet
with
all
this
he
seldom
showed
much
outward
sign
of
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
same
with
the
mother
.
<EOS>
If
she
added
little
to
the
pleasures
of
her
children
,
she
detracted
still
less
:
she
neither
grumbled
at
her
lot
,
nor
spoke
much
of
her
past
or
future
sufferings
;
as
long
as
she
had
a
maid
to
adjust
her
dress
,
and
had
those
dresses
well
made
,
nature
with
her
was
satisfied
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
same
with
the
children
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
never
rebuked
her
father
with
the
prospect
of
their
future
poverty
,
nor
did
it
seem
to
grieve
her
that
she
was
becoming
an
old
maid
so
quickly
;
her
temper
was
rarely
ruffled
,
and
,
if
we
might
judge
by
her
appearance
,
she
was
always
happy
.
<EOS>
The
signora
was
not
so
sweet
-
tempered
,
but
she
possessed
much
enduring
courage
;
she
seldom
complained
 
never
,
indeed
,
to
her
family
.
<EOS>
Though
she
had
a
cause
for
affliction
which
would
have
utterly
broken
down
the
heart
of
most
women
as
beautiful
as
she
and
as
devoid
of
all
religious
support
,
yet
she
bore
her
suffering
in
silence
,
or
alluded
to
it
only
to
elicit
the
sympathy
and
stimulate
the
admiration
of
the
men
with
whom
she
flirted
.
<EOS>
As
to
Bertie
,
one
would
have
imagined
from
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
the
gleam
of
his
eye
that
he
had
not
a
sorrow
nor
a
care
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Nor
had
he
.
<EOS>
He
was
incapable
of
anticipating
to
-
morrow
's
griefs
.
<EOS>
The
prospect
of
future
want
no
more
disturbed
his
appetite
<EOS>
than
does
that
of
the
butcher
's
knife
disturb
the
appetite
of
the
sheep
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
the
usual
tenor
of
their
way
;
but
there
were
rare
exceptions
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
the
father
would
allow
an
angry
glance
to
fall
from
his
eye
,
and
the
lion
would
send
forth
a
low
dangerous
roar
as
though
he
meditated
some
deed
of
blood
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
also
Madame
Neroni
would
become
bitter
against
mankind
,
more
than
usually
antagonistic
to
the
world
's
decencies
,
and
would
seem
as
though
she
was
about
to
break
from
her
moorings
and
allow
herself
to
be
carried
forth
by
the
tide
of
her
feelings
to
utter
ruin
and
shipwreck
.
<EOS>
She
,
however
,
like
the
rest
of
them
,
had
no
real
feelings
,
could
feel
no
true
passion
.
<EOS>
In
that
was
her
security
.
<EOS>
Before
she
resolved
on
any
contemplated
escapade
she
would
make
a
small
calculation
,
and
generally
summed
up
that
the
Stanhope
villa
or
even
Barchester
close
was
better
than
the
world
at
large
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
most
irregular
in
their
hours
.
<EOS>
The
father
was
generally
the
earliest
in
the
breakfast
-
parlour
,
and
Charlotte
would
soon
follow
and
give
him
his
coffee
,
but
the
others
breakfasted
anywhere
,
anyhow
,
and
at
any
time
.
<EOS>
On
the
morning
after
the
archdeacon
's
futile
visit
to
the
palace
,
Dr.
Stanhope
came
downstairs
with
an
ominously
dark
look
about
his
eyebrows
;
his
white
locks
were
rougher
than
usual
,
and
he
breathed
thickly
and
loudly
as
he
took
his
seat
in
his
armchair
.
<EOS>
He
had
open
letters
in
his
hand
,
and
when
Charlotte
came
into
the
room
,
he
was
still
reading
them
.
<EOS>
She
went
up
and
kissed
him
as
was
her
wo
nt
,
but
he
hardly
noticed
her
as
she
did
so
,
and
she
knew
at
once
that
something
was
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
meaning
of
that
?
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
throwing
over
the
table
a
letter
with
a
Milan
postmark
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
was
a
little
frightened
as
she
took
it
up
,
but
her
mind
was
relieved
when
she
saw
that
it
was
merely
the
bill
of
their
Italian
milliner
.
<EOS>
The
sum
total
was
certainly
large
,
but
not
so
large
as
to
create
an
important
row
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
for
our
clothes
,
Papa
,
for
six
months
before
we
came
here
.
<EOS>
The
three
of
us
ca
n't
dress
for
nothing
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
indeed
!
"
said
he
,
looking
at
the
figures
which
,
in
Milanese
denominations
,
were
certainly
monstrous
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
man
should
have
sent
it
to
me
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
had
with
all
my
heart
 
if
you
would
have
paid
it
.
<EOS>
I
see
enough
in
it
to
know
that
three
quarters
of
it
are
for
Madeline
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
little
else
to
amuse
her
,
sir
,
"
said
Charlotte
with
true
good
nature
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
suppose
he
has
nothing
else
to
amuse
him
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
throwing
over
another
letter
to
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
It
was
from
some
member
of
the
family
of
Sidonia
,
and
politely
requested
the
father
to
pay
a
small
trifle
of
£
700
,
being
the
amount
of
a
bill
discounted
in
favour
of
Mr.
Ethelbert
Stanhope
and
now
overdue
for
a
period
of
nine
months
.
  
<EOS>
Charlotte
read
the
letter
,
slowly
folded
it
up
,
and
put
it
under
the
edge
of
the
tea
-
tray
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
has
nothing
to
amuse
him
but
discounting
bills
with
Jews
.
<EOS>
Does
he
think
I
'll
pay
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
he
thinks
no
such
thing
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
does
he
think
will
pay
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
honesty
goes
I
suppose
it
wo
n't
much
matter
if
it
is
never
paid
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
he
got
very
little
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
wo
n't
much
matter
either
,
"
said
the
father
,
"
if
he
goes
to
prison
and
rots
there
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
that
that
's
the
other
alternative
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Stanhope
spoke
of
the
custom
of
his
youth
.
<EOS>
But
his
daughter
,
though
she
had
lived
so
long
abroad
,
was
much
more
completely
versed
in
the
ways
of
the
English
world
.
<EOS>
"
If
the
man
arrests
him
,
"
said
she
,
"
he
must
go
through
the
court
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
thus
,
thou
great
family
of
Sidonia
 
<EOS>
it
is
thus
that
we
Gentiles
treat
thee
,
when
,
in
our
extremest
need
,
thou
and
thine
have
aided
us
with
mountains
of
gold
as
big
as
lions
 
and
occasionally
with
wine
-
warrants
and
orders
for
dozens
of
dressing
-
cases
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
and
become
an
insolvent
?
"
said
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
that
already
,
"
said
Charlotte
,
wishing
always
to
get
over
a
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
condition
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
"
for
the
son
of
a
clergyman
of
the
Church
of
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
why
clergymen
's
sons
should
pay
their
debts
more
than
other
young
men
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
had
as
much
from
me
since
he
left
school
as
is
held
sufficient
for
the
eldest
son
of
many
a
nobleman
,
"
said
the
angry
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
said
Charlotte
,
"
give
him
another
chance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
the
doctor
,
"
do
you
mean
that
I
am
to
pay
that
Jew
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
I
would
n't
pay
him
,
he
must
take
his
chance
;
and
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
,
Bertie
must
go
abroad
.
<EOS>
But
I
want
you
to
be
civil
to
Bertie
and
let
him
remain
here
as
long
as
we
stop
.
<EOS>
He
has
a
plan
in
his
head
that
may
put
him
on
his
feet
after
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Has
he
any
plan
for
following
up
his
profession
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
'll
do
that
too
;
but
that
must
follow
.
<EOS>
He
's
thinking
of
getting
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Just
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
,
and
Bertie
came
in
whistling
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
immediately
devoted
himself
to
his
egg
and
allowed
Bertie
to
whistle
himself
round
to
his
sister
's
side
without
noticing
him
.
  
<EOS>
Charlotte
gave
a
sign
to
him
with
her
eye
,
first
glancing
at
her
father
,
and
then
at
the
letter
,
the
corner
of
which
peeped
out
from
under
the
tea
-
tray
.
<EOS>
Bertie
saw
and
understood
,
and
with
the
quiet
motion
of
a
cat
he
abstracted
the
letter
and
made
himself
acquainted
with
its
contents
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
,
however
,
had
seen
him
,
deep
as
he
appeared
to
be
mersed
in
his
egg
-
shell
,
and
said
in
his
harshest
voice
,
"
Well
,
sir
,
do
you
know
that
gentleman
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
said
Bertie
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
sort
of
acquaintance
with
him
,
but
none
that
can
justify
him
in
troubling
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
allow
me
,
sir
,
I
will
answer
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
I
sha
n't
,
"
said
the
father
,
and
then
he
added
,
after
a
pause
,
"
Is
it
true
,
sir
,
that
you
owe
the
man
£
700
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Bertie
,
"
I
think
I
should
be
inclined
to
dispute
the
amount
,
if
I
were
in
a
condition
to
pay
him
such
of
it
as
I
really
do
owe
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
he
your
bill
for
£
700
?
"
said
the
father
,
speaking
very
loudly
and
very
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
believe
he
has
,
"
said
Bertie
,
"
but
all
the
money
I
ever
got
from
him
was
£
150
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
became
of
the
£
550
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
the
commission
was
£
100
or
so
,
and
I
took
the
remainder
in
paving
-
stones
and
rocking
-
horses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Paving
-
stones
and
rocking
-
horses
!
"
said
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
Where
are
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sir
,
I
suppose
they
are
in
London
somewhere
 
<EOS>
but
I
'll
inquire
if
you
wish
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
an
idiot
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
"
and
it
's
sheer
folly
to
waste
more
money
on
him
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
save
him
from
ruin
,
"
and
so
saying
,
the
unhappy
father
walked
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
the
governor
like
to
have
the
paving
-
stones
?
"
said
Bertie
to
his
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
take
care
,
you
will
find
yourself
loose
upon
the
world
without
even
a
house
over
your
head
;
you
do
n't
know
him
as
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
He
's
very
angry
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bertie
stroked
his
big
beard
,
sipped
his
tea
,
chatted
over
his
misfortunes
in
a
half
-
comic
,
half
-
serious
tone
,
and
ended
by
promising
his
sister
that
he
would
do
his
very
best
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
the
Widow
Bold
.
<EOS>
Then
Charlotte
followed
her
father
to
his
own
room
,
softened
down
his
wrath
,
and
persuaded
him
to
say
nothing
more
about
the
Jew
bill
discounter
,
at
any
rate
for
a
few
weeks
.
<EOS>
He
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
he
would
pay
the
£
700
,
or
at
any
rate
settle
the
bill
,
if
he
saw
a
certainty
of
his
son
's
securing
for
himself
anything
like
a
decent
provision
in
life
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
said
openly
between
them
about
poor
Eleanor
,
but
the
father
and
the
daughter
understood
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
met
together
in
the
drawing
-
room
at
nine
o'clock
,
in
perfect
good
humour
with
each
other
,
and
about
that
hour
Mrs.
Bold
was
announced
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
been
in
the
house
before
,
though
she
had
of
course
called
,
and
now
she
felt
it
strange
to
find
herself
there
in
her
usual
evening
dress
,
entering
the
drawing
-
room
of
these
strangers
in
this
friendly
,
unceremonious
way
,
as
though
she
had
known
them
all
her
life
.
<EOS>
But
in
three
minutes
they
made
her
at
home
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
tripped
downstairs
and
took
her
bonnet
from
her
,
and
Bertie
came
to
relieve
her
from
her
shawl
,
and
the
signora
smiled
on
her
as
she
could
smile
when
she
chose
to
be
gracious
,
and
the
old
doctor
shook
hands
with
her
in
a
kind
benedictory
manner
that
went
to
her
heart
at
once
and
made
her
feel
that
he
must
be
a
good
man
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
not
been
seated
for
above
five
minutes
when
the
door
again
opened
and
Mr.
Slope
was
announced
.
<EOS>
She
felt
rather
surprised
,
because
she
was
told
that
nobody
was
to
be
there
,
and
it
was
very
evident
from
the
manner
of
some
of
them
that
Mr.
Slope
was
not
unexpected
.
<EOS>
But
still
there
was
not
much
in
it
.
<EOS>
In
such
invitations
a
bachelor
or
two
more
or
less
are
always
spoken
of
as
nobodies
,
and
there
was
no
reason
why
Mr.
Slope
should
not
drink
tea
at
Dr.
Stanhope
's
as
well
as
Eleanor
herself
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
was
very
much
surprised
and
not
very
much
gratified
at
finding
that
his
own
embryo
spouse
made
one
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
there
to
gratify
himself
by
gazing
on
Madame
Neroni
's
beauty
and
listening
to
and
returning
her
flattery
:
and
though
he
had
not
owned
as
much
to
himself
,
he
still
felt
that
if
he
spent
the
evening
as
he
had
intended
to
do
,
he
might
probably
not
thereby
advance
his
suit
with
Mrs.
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
The
signora
,
who
had
no
idea
of
a
rival
,
received
Mr.
Slope
with
her
usual
marks
of
distinction
.
<EOS>
As
he
took
her
hand
,
she
made
some
confidential
communication
to
him
in
a
low
voice
,
declaring
that
she
had
a
plan
to
communicate
to
him
after
tea
,
and
was
evidently
prepared
to
go
on
with
her
work
of
reducing
the
chaplain
to
a
state
of
captivity
.
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Slope
was
rather
beside
himself
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
Eleanor
could
not
but
have
learnt
from
his
demeanour
that
he
was
an
admirer
of
her
own
,
and
he
had
also
flattered
himself
that
the
idea
was
not
unacceptable
to
her
.
<EOS>
What
would
she
think
of
him
if
he
now
devoted
himself
to
a
married
woman
!
  
<EOS>
But
Eleanor
was
not
inclined
to
be
severe
in
her
criticisms
on
him
in
this
respect
,
and
felt
no
annoyance
of
any
kind
,
when
she
found
herself
seated
between
Bertie
and
Charlotte
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
suspicion
of
Mr.
Slope
's
intentions
;
she
had
no
suspicion
even
of
the
suspicion
of
other
people
;
but
still
she
felt
well
-
pleased
not
to
have
Mr.
Slope
too
near
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
And
she
was
not
ill
-
pleased
to
have
Bertie
Stanhope
near
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
rarely
indeed
that
he
failed
to
make
an
agreeable
impression
on
strangers
.
<EOS>
With
a
bishop
indeed
who
thought
much
of
his
own
dignity
it
was
possible
that
he
might
fail
,
but
hardly
with
a
young
and
pretty
woman
.
<EOS>
He
possessed
the
tact
of
becoming
instantly
intimate
with
women
without
giving
rise
to
any
fear
of
impertinence
.
<EOS>
He
had
about
him
somewhat
of
the
propensities
of
a
tame
cat
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
quite
natural
that
he
should
be
petted
,
caressed
,
and
treated
with
familiar
good
nature
,
and
that
in
return
he
should
purr
,
and
be
sleek
and
graceful
,
and
above
all
never
show
his
claws
.
<EOS>
Like
other
tame
cats
,
however
,
he
had
his
claws
,
and
sometimes
made
them
dangerous
.
  
<EOS>
When
tea
was
over
,
Charlotte
went
to
the
open
window
and
declared
loudly
that
the
full
harvest
moon
was
much
too
beautiful
to
be
disregarded
,
and
called
them
all
to
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
To
tell
the
truth
there
was
but
one
there
who
cared
much
about
the
moon
's
beauty
,
and
that
one
was
not
Charlotte
,
but
she
knew
how
valuable
an
aid
to
her
purpose
the
chaste
goddess
might
become
,
and
could
easily
create
a
little
enthusiasm
for
the
purpose
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
and
Bertie
were
soon
with
her
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
was
now
quiet
in
his
armchair
,
and
Mrs.
Stanhope
in
hers
,
both
prepared
for
slumber
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
a
Whewellite
or
a
Brewsterite
,
or
a
t'othermanite
,
Mrs.
Bold
?
"
said
Charlotte
,
who
knew
a
little
about
everything
,
and
had
read
about
a
third
of
each
of
the
books
to
which
she
alluded
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Eleanor
;
"
I
have
not
read
any
of
the
books
,
but
I
feel
sure
that
there
is
one
man
in
the
moon
at
least
,
if
not
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
believe
in
the
pulpy
gelatinous
matter
?
"
said
Bertie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
heard
about
that
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
really
think
it
's
almost
wicked
to
talk
in
such
a
manner
.
<EOS>
How
can
we
argue
about
God
's
power
in
the
other
stars
from
the
laws
which
he
has
given
for
our
rule
in
this
one
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
indeed
!
"
said
Bertie
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
n't
there
be
a
race
of
salamanders
in
Venus
?
<EOS>
And
even
if
there
be
nothing
but
fish
in
Jupiter
,
why
should
n't
the
fish
there
be
as
wide
awake
as
the
men
and
women
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
would
be
saying
very
little
for
them
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
for
Dr.
Whewell
myself
,
for
I
do
not
think
that
men
and
women
are
worth
being
repeated
in
such
countless
worlds
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
souls
in
other
stars
,
but
I
doubt
their
having
any
bodies
attached
to
them
.
<EOS>
But
come
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
let
us
put
our
bonnets
on
and
walk
round
the
close
.
<EOS>
If
we
are
to
discuss
sidereal
questions
,
we
shall
do
so
much
better
under
the
towers
of
the
cathedral
than
stuck
in
this
narrow
window
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
made
no
objection
,
and
a
party
was
made
to
walk
out
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
Stanhope
well
knew
the
rule
as
to
three
being
no
company
,
and
she
had
therefore
to
induce
her
sister
to
allow
Mr.
Slope
to
accompany
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Mr.
Slope
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
'm
sure
you
'll
join
us
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
in
again
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
Madeline
.
"
  
<EOS>
Madeline
read
in
her
eye
all
that
she
had
to
say
,
knew
her
object
,
and
as
she
had
to
depend
on
her
sister
for
so
many
of
her
amusements
,
she
felt
that
she
must
yield
.
<EOS>
It
was
hard
to
be
left
alone
while
others
of
her
own
age
walked
out
to
feel
the
soft
influence
of
the
bright
night
,
but
it
would
be
harder
still
to
be
without
the
sort
of
sanction
which
Charlotte
gave
to
all
her
flirtations
and
intrigues
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
's
eye
told
her
that
she
must
give
up
just
at
present
for
the
good
of
the
family
,
and
so
Madeline
obeyed
.
  
<EOS>
But
Charlotte
's
eyes
said
nothing
of
the
sort
to
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
objection
at
all
to
the
_
tête
-
à
-
tête
_
with
the
signora
which
the
departure
of
the
other
three
would
allow
him
,
and
gently
whispered
to
her
,
"
I
shall
not
leave
you
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
said
she
;
"
go
 
pray
go
,
pray
go
,
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
Do
not
think
that
I
am
so
selfish
.
<EOS>
It
is
understood
that
nobody
is
kept
within
for
me
.
<EOS>
You
will
understand
this
too
when
you
know
me
better
.
<EOS>
Pray
join
them
,
Mr.
Slope
,
but
when
you
come
in
speak
to
me
for
five
minutes
before
you
leave
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
understood
that
he
was
to
go
,
and
he
therefore
joined
the
party
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
had
no
objection
at
all
to
this
arrangement
,
if
he
could
have
secured
Mrs.
Bold
's
arm
;
but
this
of
course
was
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
his
fate
was
very
soon
settled
,
for
no
sooner
had
he
reached
the
hall
-
door
than
Miss
Stanhope
put
her
hand
within
his
arm
,
and
Bertie
walked
off
with
Eleanor
just
as
naturally
as
though
she
were
already
his
own
property
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
they
sauntered
forth
<EOS>
:
first
they
walked
round
the
close
,
according
to
their
avowed
intent
;
then
they
went
under
the
old
arched
gateway
below
St.
Cuthbert
's
little
church
,
and
then
they
turned
behind
the
grounds
of
the
bishop
's
palace
,
and
so
on
till
they
came
to
the
bridge
just
at
the
edge
of
the
town
,
from
which
passers
-
by
can
look
down
into
the
gardens
of
Hiram
's
Hospital
;
and
here
Charlotte
and
Mr.
Slope
,
who
were
in
advance
,
stopped
till
the
other
two
came
up
to
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
knew
that
the
gable
-
ends
and
old
brick
chimneys
which
stood
up
so
prettily
in
the
moonlight
were
those
of
Mr.
Harding
's
late
abode
,
and
would
not
have
stopped
on
such
a
spot
,
in
such
company
,
if
he
could
have
avoided
it
;
but
Miss
Stanhope
would
not
take
the
hint
which
he
tried
to
give
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
very
pretty
place
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
"
said
Charlotte
;
"
by
far
the
prettiest
place
near
Barchester
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
your
father
gave
it
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
pretty
place
,
and
now
by
the
deceitful
light
of
the
moon
looked
twice
larger
,
twice
prettier
,
twice
more
antiquely
picturesque
than
it
would
have
done
in
truth
-
telling
daylight
.
<EOS>
Who
does
not
know
the
air
of
complex
multiplicity
and
the
mysterious
interesting
grace
which
the
moon
always
lends
to
old
gabled
buildings
half
-
surrounded
,
as
was
the
hospital
,
by
fine
trees
!
<EOS>
As
seen
from
the
bridge
on
the
night
of
which
we
are
speaking
,
Mr.
Harding
's
late
abode
did
look
very
lovely
,
and
though
Eleanor
did
not
grieve
at
her
father
's
having
left
it
,
she
felt
at
the
moment
an
intense
wish
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
going
to
return
to
it
almost
immediately
,
is
he
not
?
"
asked
Bertie
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
made
no
immediate
reply
.
<EOS>
Many
such
a
question
passes
unanswered
without
the
notice
of
the
questioner
,
but
such
was
not
now
the
case
.
<EOS>
They
all
remained
silent
as
though
expecting
her
to
reply
,
and
after
a
moment
or
two
,
Charlotte
said
,
"
I
believe
it
is
settled
that
Mr.
Harding
returns
to
the
hospital
,
is
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
anything
about
it
is
settled
yet
,
"
said
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
must
be
a
matter
of
course
,
"
said
Bertie
;
"
that
is
,
if
your
father
wishes
it
.
<EOS>
Who
else
on
earth
could
hold
it
after
what
has
occurred
?
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
quietly
made
her
companion
understand
that
the
matter
was
one
which
she
could
not
discuss
in
the
present
company
,
and
then
they
passed
on
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
said
she
would
go
a
short
way
up
the
hill
out
of
the
town
so
as
to
look
back
upon
the
towers
of
the
cathedral
,
and
as
Eleanor
leant
upon
Bertie
's
arm
for
assistance
in
the
walk
,
she
told
him
how
the
matter
stood
between
her
father
and
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
,
he
,
"
said
Bertie
,
pointing
on
to
Mr.
Slope
,
"
what
part
does
he
take
in
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
explained
how
Mr.
Slope
had
at
first
endeavoured
to
tyrannize
over
her
father
,
but
how
he
had
latterly
come
round
and
done
all
he
could
to
talk
the
bishop
over
in
Mr.
Harding
's
favour
.
"
<EOS>
But
my
father
,
"
she
said
,
"
is
hardly
inclined
to
trust
him
;
they
all
say
he
is
so
arrogant
to
the
old
clergymen
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
my
word
for
it
,
"
said
Bertie
,
"
your
father
is
right
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
not
very
much
mistaken
,
that
man
is
both
arrogant
and
false
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
strolled
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
then
returned
through
the
fields
by
a
foot
-
path
which
leads
by
a
small
wooden
bridge
,
or
rather
a
plank
with
a
rustic
rail
to
it
,
over
the
river
to
the
other
side
of
the
cathedral
from
that
at
which
they
had
started
.
<EOS>
They
had
thus
walked
round
the
bishop
's
grounds
,
through
which
the
river
runs
,
and
round
the
cathedral
and
adjacent
fields
,
and
it
was
past
eleven
before
they
reached
the
doctor
's
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
late
,
"
said
Eleanor
;
"
it
will
be
a
shame
to
disturb
your
mother
again
at
such
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
"
"
said
Charlotte
,
laughing
,
"
you
wo
n't
disturb
Mamma
<EOS>
;
I
dare
say
she
is
in
bed
by
this
time
,
and
Madeline
would
be
furious
if
you
did
not
come
in
and
see
her
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Bertie
,
take
Mrs.
Bold
's
bonnet
from
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
went
upstairs
and
found
the
signora
alone
,
reading
.
<EOS>
She
looked
somewhat
sad
and
melancholy
,
but
not
more
so
perhaps
than
was
sufficient
to
excite
additional
interest
in
the
bosom
of
Mr.
Slope
;
and
she
was
soon
deep
in
whispered
intercourse
with
that
happy
gentleman
,
who
was
allowed
to
find
a
resting
-
place
on
her
sofa
.
<EOS>
The
signora
had
a
way
of
whispering
that
was
peculiarly
her
own
,
and
was
exactly
the
reverse
of
that
which
prevails
among
great
tragedians
.
<EOS>
The
great
tragedian
hisses
out
a
positive
whisper
,
made
with
bated
breath
,
and
produced
by
inarticulated
tongue
-
formed
sounds
,
but
yet
he
is
audible
through
the
whole
house
.
<EOS>
The
signora
,
however
,
used
no
hisses
and
produced
all
her
words
in
a
clear
,
silver
tone
,
but
they
could
only
be
heard
by
the
ear
into
which
they
were
poured
.
  
<EOS>
Charlotte
hurried
and
scurried
about
the
room
hither
and
thither
,
doing
,
or
pretending
to
do
many
things
;
then
,
saying
something
about
seeing
her
mother
,
ran
upstairs
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
was
thus
left
alone
with
Bertie
,
and
she
hardly
felt
an
hour
fly
by
her
.
<EOS>
To
give
Bertie
his
due
credit
,
he
could
not
have
played
his
cards
better
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
make
love
to
her
,
nor
sigh
,
nor
look
languishing
,
but
he
was
amusing
and
familiar
,
yet
respectful
;
and
when
he
left
Eleanor
at
her
own
door
at
one
o'clock
,
which
he
did
by
the
by
with
the
assistance
of
the
now
jealous
Slope
,
she
thought
that
he
was
one
of
the
most
agreeable
men
and
the
Stanhopes
decidedly
the
most
agreeable
family
that
she
had
ever
met
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
 
<EOS>
The
Rev.
Francis
Arabin
,
fellow
of
Lazarus
,
late
professor
of
poetry
at
Oxford
,
and
present
vicar
of
St.
Ewold
,
in
the
diocese
of
Barchester
,
must
now
be
introduced
personally
to
the
reader
.
<EOS>
He
is
worthy
of
a
new
volume
,
and
as
he
will
fill
a
conspicuous
place
in
it
,
it
is
desirable
that
he
should
be
made
to
stand
before
the
reader
's
eye
by
the
aid
of
such
portraiture
as
the
author
is
able
to
produce
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
to
be
regretted
that
no
mental
method
of
daguerreotype
or
photography
has
yet
been
discovered
by
which
the
characters
of
men
can
be
reduced
to
writing
and
put
into
grammatical
language
with
an
unerring
precision
of
truthful
description
.
<EOS>
How
often
does
the
novelist
feel
,
ay
,
and
the
historian
also
and
the
biographer
,
that
he
has
conceived
within
his
mind
and
accurately
depicted
on
the
tablet
of
his
brain
the
full
character
and
personage
of
a
man
,
and
that
nevertheless
,
when
he
flies
to
pen
and
ink
to
perpetuate
the
portrait
,
his
words
forsake
,
elude
,
disappoint
,
and
play
the
deuce
with
him
,
till
at
the
end
of
a
dozen
pages
the
man
described
has
no
more
resemblance
to
the
man
conceived
than
the
sign
-
board
at
the
corner
of
the
street
has
to
the
Duke
of
Cambridge
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
such
mechanical
descriptive
skill
would
hardly
give
more
satisfaction
to
the
reader
than
the
skill
of
the
photographer
<EOS>
does
to
the
anxious
mother
desirous
to
possess
an
absolute
duplicate
of
her
beloved
child
.
<EOS>
The
likeness
is
indeed
true
,
but
it
is
a
dull
,
dead
,
unfeeling
,
inauspicious
likeness
.
<EOS>
The
face
is
indeed
there
,
and
those
looking
at
it
will
know
at
once
whose
image
it
is
,
but
the
owner
of
the
face
will
not
be
proud
of
the
resemblance
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
no
royal
road
to
learning
,
no
short
cut
to
the
acquirement
of
any
valuable
art
.
<EOS>
Let
photographers
and
daguerreotypers
do
what
they
will
,
and
improve
as
they
may
with
further
skill
on
that
which
skill
has
already
done
,
they
will
never
achieve
a
portrait
of
the
human
face
divine
.
<EOS>
Let
biographers
,
novelists
,
and
the
rest
of
us
groan
as
we
may
under
the
burdens
which
we
so
often
feel
too
heavy
for
our
shoulders
;
we
must
either
bear
them
up
like
men
,
or
own
ourselves
too
weak
for
the
work
we
have
undertaken
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
way

well
and
also
of
writing
easily

<EOS>
_
Labor
omnia
vincit
improbus
_
.
<EOS>
Such
should
be
the
chosen
motto
of
every
labourer
,
and
it
may
be
that
labour
,
if
adequately
enduring
,
may
suffice
at
last
to
produce
even
some
not
untrue
resemblance
of
the
Rev.
Francis
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
Of
his
doings
in
the
world
,
and
of
the
sort
of
fame
which
he
has
achieved
,
enough
has
been
already
said
.
<EOS>
It
has
also
been
said
that
he
is
forty
years
of
age
,
and
still
unmarried
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
younger
son
of
a
country
gentleman
of
small
fortune
in
the
north
of
England
.
<EOS>
At
an
early
age
he
went
to
Winchester
,
and
was
intended
by
his
father
for
New
College
;
but
though
studious
as
a
boy
,
he
was
not
studious
within
the
prescribed
limits
,
and
at
the
age
of
eighteen
he
left
school
with
a
character
for
talent
,
but
without
a
scholarship
.
<EOS>
All
that
he
had
obtained
,
over
and
above
the
advantage
of
his
character
,
was
a
gold
medal
for
English
verse
,
and
hence
was
derived
a
strong
presumption
on
the
part
of
his
friends
that
he
was
destined
to
add
another
name
to
the
imperishable
list
of
English
poets
.
  
<EOS>
From
Winchester
he
went
to
Oxford
,
and
was
entered
as
a
commoner
at
Balliol
.
<EOS>
Here
his
special
career
very
soon
commenced
.
<EOS>
He
utterly
eschewed
the
society
of
fast
men
,
gave
no
wine
-
parties
,
kept
no
horses
,
rowed
no
boats
,
joined
no
rows
,
and
was
the
pride
of
his
college
tutor
.
<EOS>
Such
at
least
was
his
career
till
he
had
taken
his
little
go
,
and
then
he
commenced
a
course
of
action
which
,
though
not
less
creditable
to
himself
as
a
man
,
was
hardly
so
much
to
the
taste
of
the
tutor
.
<EOS>
He
became
a
member
of
a
vigorous
debating
society
,
and
rendered
himself
remarkable
there
for
humorous
energy
.
<EOS>
Though
always
in
earnest
,
yet
his
earnestness
was
always
droll
.
<EOS>
To
be
true
in
his
ideas
,
unanswerable
in
his
syllogisms
,
and
just
in
his
aspirations
was
not
enough
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
failed
,
failed
in
his
own
opinion
as
well
as
that
of
others
when
others
came
to
know
him
,
if
he
could
not
reduce
the
arguments
of
his
opponents
to
an
absurdity
and
conquer
both
by
wit
and
reason
.
<EOS>
To
say
that
his
object
was
ever
to
raise
a
laugh
would
be
most
untrue
.
<EOS>
He
hated
such
common
and
unnecessary
evidence
of
satisfaction
on
the
part
of
his
hearers
.
<EOS>
A
joke
that
required
to
be
laughed
at
was
,
with
him
,
not
worth
uttering
.
<EOS>
He
could
appreciate
by
a
keener
sense
than
that
of
his
ears
the
success
of
his
wit
,
and
would
see
in
the
eyes
of
his
auditors
whether
or
no
he
was
understood
and
appreciated
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
religious
lad
before
he
left
school
.
<EOS>
That
is
,
he
had
addicted
himself
to
a
party
in
religion
,
and
having
done
so
had
received
that
benefit
which
most
men
do
who
become
partisans
in
such
a
cause
.
<EOS>
We
are
much
too
apt
to
look
at
schism
in
our
church
as
an
unmitigated
evil
.
<EOS>
Moderate
schism
,
if
there
may
be
such
a
thing
,
at
any
rate
calls
attention
to
the
subject
,
draws
in
supporters
who
would
otherwise
have
been
inattentive
to
the
matter
,
and
teaches
men
to
think
upon
religion
.
<EOS>
How
great
an
amount
of
good
of
this
description
has
followed
that
movement
in
the
Church
of
England
which
commenced
with
the
publication
of
Froude
's
Remains
!
  
<EOS>
As
a
boy
young
Arabin
took
up
the
cudgels
on
the
side
of
the
Tractarians
,
and
at
Oxford
he
sat
for
a
while
at
the
feet
of
the
great
Newman
.
<EOS>
To
this
cause
he
lent
all
his
faculties
.
<EOS>
For
it
he
concocted
verses
,
for
it
he
made
speeches
,
for
it
he
scintillated
the
brightest
sparks
of
his
quiet
wit
.
<EOS>
For
it
he
ate
and
drank
and
dressed
and
had
his
being
.
<EOS>
In
due
process
of
time
he
took
his
degree
and
wrote
himself
B.A.
,
but
he
did
not
do
so
with
any
remarkable
amount
of
academical
éclat
.
<EOS>
He
had
occupied
himself
too
much
with
High
Church
matters
and
the
polemics
,
politics
,
and
outward
demonstrations
usually
concurrent
with
High
Churchmanship
to
devote
himself
with
sufficient
vigour
to
the
acquisition
of
a
double
first
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
double
first
,
nor
even
a
first
class
man
,
but
he
revenged
himself
on
the
university
by
putting
firsts
and
double
firsts
out
of
fashion
for
the
year
and
laughing
down
a
species
of
pedantry
which
,
at
the
age
of
twenty
-
three
,
leaves
no
room
in
a
man
's
mind
for
graver
subjects
than
conic
sections
or
Greek
accents
.
  
<EOS>
Greek
accents
,
however
,
and
conic
sections
were
esteemed
necessaries
at
Balliol
,
and
there
was
no
admittance
there
for
Mr.
Arabin
within
the
list
of
its
fellows
.
<EOS>
Lazarus
,
however
,
the
richest
and
most
comfortable
abode
of
Oxford
dons
,
opened
its
bosom
to
the
young
champion
of
a
church
militant
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
was
ordained
,
and
became
a
fellow
soon
after
taking
his
degree
,
and
shortly
after
that
was
chosen
professor
of
poetry
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
came
the
moment
of
his
great
danger
.
<EOS>
After
many
mental
struggles
,
and
an
agony
of
doubt
which
may
be
well
surmised
,
the
great
prophet
of
the
Tractarians
confessed
himself
a
Roman
Catholic
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Newman
left
the
Church
of
England
and
with
him
carried
many
a
waverer
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
carry
off
Mr.
Arabin
,
but
the
escape
which
that
gentleman
had
was
a
very
narrow
one
.
<EOS>
He
left
Oxford
for
awhile
that
he
might
meditate
in
complete
peace
on
the
step
which
appeared
to
him
to
be
all
but
unavoidable
,
and
shut
himself
up
in
a
little
village
on
the
sea
-
shore
of
one
of
our
remotest
counties
,
that
he
might
learn
by
communing
with
his
own
soul
<EOS>
whether
or
no
he
could
with
a
safe
conscience
remain
within
the
pale
of
his
mother
church
.
  
<EOS>
Things
would
have
gone
badly
with
him
there
had
he
been
left
entirely
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Everything
was
against
him
:
all
his
worldly
interests
required
him
to
remain
a
Protestant
,
and
he
looked
on
his
worldly
interests
as
a
legion
of
foes
,
to
get
the
better
of
whom
was
a
point
of
extremest
honour
.
<EOS>
In
his
then
state
of
ecstatic
agony
such
a
conquest
would
have
cost
him
little
;
he
could
easily
have
thrown
away
all
his
livelihood
;
but
it
cost
him
much
to
get
over
the
idea
that
by
choosing
the
Church
of
England
he
should
be
open
in
his
own
mind
to
the
charge
that
he
had
been
led
to
such
a
choice
by
unworthy
motives
.
<EOS>
Then
his
heart
was
against
him
:
he
loved
with
a
strong
and
eager
love
the
man
who
had
hitherto
been
his
guide
,
and
yearned
to
follow
his
footsteps
.
<EOS>
His
tastes
were
against
him
:
the
ceremonies
and
pomps
of
the
Church
of
Rome
,
their
august
feasts
and
solemn
fasts
,
invited
his
imagination
and
pleased
his
eye
.
<EOS>
His
flesh
was
against
him
:
<EOS>
how
great
an
aid
would
it
be
to
a
poor
,
weak
,
wavering
man
to
be
constrained
to
high
moral
duties
,
self
-
denial
,
obedience
,
and
chastity
by
laws
which
were
certain
in
their
enactments
,
and
not
to
be
broken
without
loud
,
palpable
,
unmistakable
sin
!
<EOS>
Then
his
faith
was
against
him
:
he
required
to
believe
so
much
;
panted
so
eagerly
to
give
signs
of
his
belief
;
deemed
it
so
insufficient
to
wash
himself
simply
in
the
waters
of
Jordan
;
that
some
great
deed
,
such
as
that
of
forsaking
everything
for
a
true
Church
,
had
for
him
allurements
almost
past
withstanding
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
was
at
this
time
a
very
young
man
,
and
when
he
left
Oxford
for
his
far
retreat
was
much
too
confident
in
his
powers
of
fence
,
and
too
apt
to
look
down
on
the
ordinary
sense
of
ordinary
people
,
to
expect
aid
in
the
battle
that
he
had
to
fight
from
any
chance
inhabitants
of
the
spot
which
he
had
selected
.
<EOS>
But
Providence
was
good
to
him
;
there
,
in
that
all
but
desolate
place
,
on
the
storm
-
beat
shore
of
that
distant
sea
,
he
met
one
who
gradually
calmed
his
mind
,
quieted
his
imagination
,
and
taught
him
something
of
a
Christian
's
duty
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Arabin
left
Oxford
,
he
was
inclined
to
look
upon
the
rural
clergymen
of
most
English
parishes
almost
with
contempt
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
ambition
,
should
he
remain
within
the
fold
of
their
church
,
to
do
somewhat
towards
redeeming
and
rectifying
their
inferiority
and
to
assist
in
infusing
energy
and
faith
into
the
hearts
of
Christian
ministers
,
who
were
,
as
he
thought
,
too
often
satisfied
to
go
through
life
without
much
show
of
either
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
it
was
from
such
a
one
that
Mr.
Arabin
in
his
extremest
need
received
that
aid
which
he
so
much
required
.
<EOS>
It
was
from
the
poor
curate
of
a
small
Cornish
parish
that
he
first
learnt
to
know
that
the
highest
laws
for
the
governance
of
a
Christian
's
duty
must
act
from
within
and
not
from
without
;
that
no
man
can
become
a
serviceable
servant
solely
by
obedience
to
written
edicts
;
and
that
the
safety
which
he
was
about
to
seek
within
the
gates
of
Rome
was
no
other
than
the
selfish
freedom
from
personal
danger
which
the
bad
soldier
attempts
to
gain
who
counterfeits
illness
on
the
eve
of
battle
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
returned
to
Oxford
a
humbler
but
a
better
and
a
happier
man
,
and
from
that
time
forth
he
put
his
shoulder
to
the
wheel
as
a
clergyman
of
the
Church
for
which
he
had
been
educated
.
<EOS>
The
intercourse
of
those
among
whom
he
familiarly
lived
kept
him
staunch
to
the
principles
of
that
system
of
the
Church
to
which
he
had
always
belonged
.
<EOS>
Since
his
severance
from
Mr.
Newman
,
no
one
had
had
so
strong
an
influence
over
him
as
the
head
of
his
college
.
<EOS>
During
the
time
of
his
expected
apostasy
Dr.
Gwynne
had
not
felt
much
predisposition
in
favour
of
the
young
fellow
.
<EOS>
Though
a
High
Churchman
himself
within
moderate
limits
,
Dr.
Gwynne
felt
no
sympathy
with
men
who
could
not
satisfy
their
faiths
with
the
Thirty
-
nine
Articles
.
<EOS>
He
regarded
the
enthusiasm
of
such
as
Newman
as
a
state
of
mind
more
nearly
allied
to
madness
than
to
religion
,
and
when
he
saw
it
evinced
by
very
young
men
,
he
was
inclined
to
attribute
a
good
deal
of
it
to
vanity
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
himself
,
though
a
religious
man
,
was
also
a
thoroughly
practical
man
of
the
world
,
and
he
regarded
with
no
favourable
eye
the
tenets
of
anyone
who
looked
on
the
two
things
as
incompatible
.
<EOS>
When
he
found
that
Mr.
Arabin
was
a
half
Roman
,
he
began
to
regret
all
he
had
done
towards
bestowing
a
fellowship
on
so
unworthy
a
recipient
;
and
when
again
he
learnt
that
Mr.
Arabin
would
probably
complete
his
journey
to
Rome
,
he
regarded
with
some
satisfaction
the
fact
that
in
such
case
the
fellowship
would
be
again
vacant
.
  
<EOS>
When
,
however
,
Mr.
Arabin
returned
and
professed
himself
a
confirmed
Protestant
,
the
Master
of
Lazarus
again
opened
his
arms
to
him
,
and
gradually
he
became
the
pet
of
the
college
.
<EOS>
For
some
little
time
he
was
saturnine
,
silent
,
and
unwilling
to
take
any
prominent
part
in
university
broils
,
but
gradually
his
mind
recovered
,
or
rather
made
its
tone
,
and
he
became
known
as
a
man
always
ready
at
a
moment
's
notice
to
take
up
the
cudgels
in
opposition
to
anything
that
savoured
of
an
evangelical
bearing
.
<EOS>
He
was
great
in
sermons
,
great
on
platforms
,
great
at
after
-
dinner
conversations
,
and
always
pleasant
as
well
as
great
.
<EOS>
He
took
delight
in
elections
,
served
on
committees
,
opposed
tooth
and
nail
all
projects
of
university
reform
,
and
talked
jovially
over
his
glass
of
port
of
the
ruin
to
be
anticipated
by
the
Church
and
of
the
sacrilege
daily
committed
by
the
Whigs
.
<EOS>
The
ordeal
through
which
he
had
gone
in
resisting
the
blandishments
of
the
lady
of
Rome
had
certainly
done
much
towards
the
strengthening
of
his
character
.
<EOS>
Although
in
small
and
outward
matters
he
was
self
-
confident
enough
,
nevertheless
in
things
affecting
the
inner
man
he
aimed
at
a
humility
of
spirit
which
would
never
have
been
attractive
to
him
but
for
that
visit
to
the
coast
of
Cornwall
.
<EOS>
This
visit
he
now
repeated
every
year
.
  
<EOS>
Such
is
an
interior
view
of
Mr.
Arabin
at
the
time
when
he
accepted
the
living
of
St.
Ewold
.
<EOS>
Exteriorly
,
he
was
not
a
remarkable
person
.
<EOS>
He
was
above
the
middle
height
,
well
-
made
,
and
very
active
.
<EOS>
His
hair
,
which
had
been
jet
black
,
was
now
tinged
with
gray
,
but
his
face
bore
no
sign
of
years
.
<EOS>
It
would
perhaps
be
wrong
to
say
that
he
was
handsome
,
but
his
face
was
nevertheless
pleasant
to
look
upon
.
<EOS>
The
cheek
-
bones
were
rather
too
high
for
beauty
,
and
the
formation
of
the
forehead
too
massive
and
heavy
:
but
the
eyes
,
nose
,
and
mouth
were
perfect
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
continual
play
of
lambent
fire
about
his
eyes
,
which
gave
promise
of
either
pathos
or
humour
whenever
he
essayed
to
speak
,
and
that
promise
was
rarely
broken
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
gentle
play
about
his
mouth
which
declared
that
his
wit
never
descended
to
sarcasm
,
and
that
there
was
no
ill
-
nature
in
his
repartee
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
was
a
popular
man
among
women
,
but
more
so
as
a
general
than
a
special
favourite
.
<EOS>
Living
as
a
fellow
at
Oxford
,
marriage
with
him
had
been
out
of
the
question
,
and
it
may
be
doubted
whether
he
had
ever
allowed
his
heart
to
be
touched
.
<EOS>
Though
belonging
to
a
church
in
which
celibacy
is
not
the
required
lot
of
its
ministers
,
he
had
come
to
regard
himself
as
one
of
those
clergymen
to
whom
to
be
a
bachelor
is
almost
a
necessity
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
looked
for
parochial
duty
,
and
his
career
at
Oxford
was
utterly
incompatible
with
such
domestic
joys
as
a
wife
and
nursery
.
<EOS>
He
looked
on
women
,
therefore
,
in
the
same
light
that
one
sees
them
regarded
by
many
Romish
priests
.
<EOS>
He
liked
to
have
near
him
that
which
was
pretty
and
amusing
,
but
women
generally
were
little
more
to
him
than
children
.
<EOS>
He
talked
to
them
without
putting
out
all
his
powers
,
and
listened
to
them
without
any
idea
that
what
he
should
hear
from
them
could
either
actuate
his
conduct
or
influence
his
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
Mr.
Arabin
,
the
new
vicar
of
St.
Ewold
,
who
is
going
to
stay
with
the
Grantlys
at
Plumstead
Episcopi
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
reached
Plumstead
the
day
before
Mr.
Harding
and
Eleanor
,
and
the
Grantly
family
were
thus
enabled
to
make
his
acquaintance
and
discuss
his
qualifications
before
the
arrival
of
the
other
guests
.
<EOS>
Griselda
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
looked
so
young
,
but
she
told
Florinda
her
younger
sister
,
when
they
had
retired
for
the
night
,
that
he
did
not
talk
at
all
like
a
young
man
:
and
she
decided
with
the
authority
that
seventeen
has
over
sixteen
that
he
was
not
at
all
nice
,
although
his
eyes
were
lovely
.
<EOS>
As
usual
,
sixteen
implicitly
acceded
to
the
dictum
of
seventeen
in
such
a
matter
,
and
said
that
he
certainly
was
not
nice
.
<EOS>
They
then
branched
off
on
the
relative
merits
of
other
clerical
bachelors
in
the
vicinity
,
and
both
determined
without
any
feeling
of
jealousy
between
them
that
a
certain
Rev.
Augustus
Green
was
by
many
degrees
the
most
estimable
of
the
lot
.
<EOS>
The
gentleman
in
question
had
certainly
much
in
his
favour
,
as
,
having
a
comfortable
allowance
from
his
father
,
he
could
devote
the
whole
proceeds
of
his
curacy
to
violet
gloves
and
unexceptionable
neck
ties
.
<EOS>
Having
thus
fixedly
resolved
that
the
new
-
comer
had
nothing
about
him
to
shake
the
pre
-
eminence
of
the
exalted
Green
,
the
two
girls
went
to
sleep
in
each
other
's
arms
,
contented
with
themselves
and
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
at
first
sight
came
to
much
the
same
conclusion
about
her
husband
's
favourite
as
her
daughters
had
done
,
though
,
in
seeking
to
measure
his
relative
value
,
she
did
not
compare
him
to
Mr.
Green
;
indeed
,
she
made
no
comparison
by
name
between
him
and
anyone
else
;
but
she
remarked
to
her
husband
that
one
person
's
swans
were
very
often
another
person
's
geese
,
thereby
clearly
showing
that
Mr.
Arabin
had
not
yet
proved
his
qualifications
in
swanhood
to
her
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Susan
,
"
said
he
,
rather
offended
at
hearing
his
friend
spoken
of
so
disrespectfully
,
"
if
you
take
Mr.
Arabin
for
a
goose
,
I
can
not
say
that
I
think
very
highly
of
your
discrimination
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
goose
!
<EOS>
No
,
of
course
,
he
's
not
a
goose
.
<EOS>
I
've
no
doubt
he
's
a
very
clever
man
.
<EOS>
But
you
're
so
matter
-
of
-
fact
,
<EOS>
Archdeacon
,
when
it
suits
your
purpose
,
that
one
ca
n't
trust
oneself
to
any
_
façon
de
parler
_
.
<EOS>
I
've
no
doubt
Mr.
Arabin
is
a
very
valuable
man
 
at
Oxford
 
and
that
he
'll
be
a
good
vicar
at
St.
Ewold
.
<EOS>
All
I
mean
is
that
,
having
passed
one
evening
with
him
,
I
do
n't
find
him
to
be
absolutely
a
paragon
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
if
I
am
not
mistaken
,
he
is
a
little
inclined
to
be
conceited
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
all
the
men
that
I
know
intimately
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
<EOS>
"
Arabin
is
,
in
my
opinion
,
the
most
free
from
any
taint
of
self
-
conceit
.
<EOS>
His
fault
is
that
he
's
too
diffident
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
so
,
"
said
the
lady
;
"
only
I
must
own
<EOS>
I
did
not
find
it
out
this
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Nothing
further
was
said
about
him
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
thought
that
his
wife
was
abusing
Mr.
Arabin
merely
because
he
had
praised
him
,
and
Mrs.
Grantly
knew
that
it
was
useless
arguing
for
or
against
any
person
in
favour
of
or
in
opposition
to
whom
the
archdeacon
had
already
pronounced
a
strong
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
In
truth
,
they
were
both
right
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
was
a
diffident
man
in
social
intercourse
with
those
whom
he
did
not
intimately
know
;
when
placed
in
situations
which
it
was
his
business
to
fill
,
and
discussing
matters
with
which
it
was
his
duty
to
be
conversant
,
Mr.
Arabin
was
from
habit
brazen
-
faced
enough
.
<EOS>
When
standing
on
a
platform
in
Exeter
Hall
,
no
man
would
be
less
mazed
than
he
by
the
eyes
of
the
crowd
before
him
,
for
such
was
the
work
which
his
profession
had
called
on
him
to
perform
;
but
he
shrank
from
a
strong
expression
of
opinion
in
general
society
,
and
his
doing
so
not
uncommonly
made
it
appear
that
he
considered
the
company
not
worth
the
trouble
of
his
energy
.
<EOS>
He
was
averse
to
dictate
when
the
place
did
not
seem
to
him
to
justify
dictation
,
and
as
those
subjects
on
which
people
wished
to
hear
him
speak
were
such
as
he
was
accustomed
to
treat
with
decision
,
he
generally
shunned
the
traps
there
were
laid
to
allure
him
into
discussion
,
and
,
by
doing
so
,
not
infrequently
subjected
himself
to
such
charges
as
those
brought
against
him
by
Mrs.
Grantly
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
as
he
sat
at
his
open
window
,
enjoying
the
delicious
moonlight
and
gazing
at
the
gray
towers
of
the
church
,
which
stood
almost
within
the
rectory
grounds
,
little
dreamed
that
he
was
the
subject
of
so
many
friendly
or
unfriendly
criticisms
.
<EOS>
Considering
how
much
we
are
all
given
to
discuss
the
characters
of
others
,
and
discuss
them
often
not
in
the
strictest
spirit
of
charity
,
it
is
singular
how
little
we
are
inclined
to
think
that
others
can
speak
ill
-
naturedly
of
us
,
and
how
angry
and
hurt
we
are
when
proof
reaches
us
that
they
have
done
so
.
<EOS>
It
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
we
all
of
us
occasionally
speak
of
our
dearest
friends
in
a
manner
in
which
those
dearest
friends
would
very
little
like
to
hear
themselves
mentioned
,
and
that
we
nevertheless
expect
that
our
dearest
friends
shall
invariably
speak
of
us
as
though
they
were
blind
to
all
our
faults
,
but
keenly
alive
to
every
shade
of
our
virtues
.
  
<EOS>
It
did
not
occur
to
Mr.
Arabin
that
he
was
spoken
of
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
,
when
he
compared
himself
with
his
host
,
that
he
was
a
person
of
so
little
consequence
to
any
,
that
he
was
worth
no
one
's
words
or
thoughts
.
<EOS>
He
was
utterly
alone
in
the
world
as
regarded
domestic
ties
and
those
inner
familiar
relations
which
are
hardly
possible
between
others
than
husbands
and
wives
,
parents
and
children
,
or
brothers
and
sisters
.
<EOS>
He
had
often
discussed
with
himself
the
necessity
of
such
bonds
for
a
man
's
happiness
in
this
world
,
and
had
generally
satisfied
himself
with
the
answer
that
happiness
in
this
world
is
not
a
necessity
.
<EOS>
Herein
he
deceived
himself
,
or
rather
tried
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
,
like
others
,
yearned
for
the
enjoyment
of
whatever
he
saw
enjoyable
,
and
though
he
attempted
,
with
the
modern
stoicism
of
so
many
Christians
,
to
make
himself
believe
that
joy
and
sorrow
were
matters
which
here
should
be
held
as
perfectly
indifferent
,
these
things
were
not
indifferent
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
tired
of
his
Oxford
rooms
and
his
college
life
.
<EOS>
He
regarded
the
wife
and
children
of
his
friend
with
something
like
envy
;
<EOS>
he
all
but
coveted
the
pleasant
drawing
-
room
,
with
its
pretty
windows
opening
on
to
lawns
and
flower
-
beds
,
the
apparel
of
the
comfortable
house
,
and
 
above
all
 
the
air
of
home
which
encompassed
it
all
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
said
that
no
time
can
have
been
so
fitted
for
such
desires
on
his
part
as
this
,
when
he
had
just
possessed
himself
of
a
country
parish
,
of
a
living
among
fields
and
gardens
,
of
a
house
which
a
wife
would
grace
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
there
was
a
difference
between
the
opulence
of
Plumstead
and
the
modest
economy
of
St.
Ewold
,
but
surely
Mr.
Arabin
was
not
a
man
to
sigh
after
wealth
!
<EOS>
Of
all
men
,
his
friends
would
have
unanimously
declared
he
was
the
last
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
But
how
little
our
friends
know
us
!
<EOS>
In
his
period
of
stoical
rejection
of
this
world
's
happiness
,
he
had
cast
from
him
as
utter
dross
all
anxiety
as
to
fortune
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
as
it
were
,
proclaimed
himself
to
be
indifferent
to
promotion
,
and
those
who
chiefly
admired
his
talents
,
and
would
mainly
have
exerted
themselves
to
secure
to
them
their
deserved
reward
,
had
taken
him
at
his
word
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
if
the
truth
must
out
,
he
felt
himself
disappointed
 
<EOS>
disappointed
not
by
them
but
by
himself
.
<EOS>
The
daydream
of
his
youth
was
over
,
and
at
the
age
of
forty
he
felt
that
he
was
not
fit
to
work
in
the
spirit
of
an
apostle
.
<EOS>
He
had
mistaken
himself
,
and
learned
his
mistake
when
it
was
past
remedy
.
<EOS>
He
had
professed
himself
indifferent
to
mitres
and
diaconal
residences
,
to
rich
livings
and
pleasant
glebes
,
and
now
he
had
to
own
to
himself
that
he
was
sighing
for
the
good
things
of
other
men
on
whom
,
in
his
pride
,
he
had
ventured
to
look
down
.
  
<EOS>
Not
for
wealth
,
in
its
vulgar
sense
,
had
he
ever
sighed
;
not
for
the
enjoyment
of
rich
things
<EOS>
had
he
ever
longed
;
but
for
the
allotted
share
of
worldly
bliss
<EOS>
which
a
wife
,
and
children
,
and
happy
home
could
give
him
,
for
that
usual
amount
of
comfort
which
he
had
ventured
to
reject
as
unnecessary
for
him
<EOS>
,
he
did
now
feel
that
he
would
have
been
wiser
to
have
searched
.
  
<EOS>
He
knew
that
his
talents
,
his
position
,
and
his
friends
would
have
won
for
him
promotion
,
had
he
put
himself
in
the
way
of
winning
it
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
doing
so
,
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
to
accept
a
living
which
would
give
him
an
income
of
some
£
300
a
year
<EOS>
should
he
,
by
marrying
,
throw
up
his
fellowship
.
<EOS>
Such
,
at
the
age
of
forty
,
was
the
worldly
result
of
labour
which
the
world
had
chosen
to
regard
as
successful
.
<EOS>
The
world
also
thought
that
Mr.
Arabin
was
,
in
his
own
estimation
,
sufficiently
paid
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
The
world
was
mistaken
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
was
beginning
to
ascertain
that
such
was
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
And
here
may
I
beg
the
reader
not
to
be
hard
in
his
judgement
upon
this
man
.
<EOS>
Is
not
the
state
at
which
he
has
arrived
the
natural
result
of
efforts
to
reach
that
which
is
not
the
condition
of
humanity
?
<EOS>
Is
not
modern
stoicism
,
built
though
it
be
on
Christianity
,
as
great
an
outrage
on
human
nature
as
was
the
stoicism
of
the
ancients
?
<EOS>
The
philosophy
of
Zeno
was
built
on
true
laws
,
but
on
true
laws
misunderstood
and
therefore
misapplied
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
same
with
our
Stoics
here
,
who
would
teach
us
that
wealth
and
worldly
comfort
and
happiness
on
earth
are
not
worth
the
search
.
<EOS>
Alas
,
for
a
doctrine
which
can
find
no
believing
pupils
and
no
true
teachers
!
  
<EOS>
The
case
of
Mr.
Arabin
was
the
more
singular
,
as
he
belonged
to
a
branch
of
the
Church
of
England
well
inclined
to
regard
its
temporalities
with
avowed
favour
,
and
had
habitually
lived
with
men
who
were
accustomed
to
much
worldly
comfort
.
<EOS>
But
such
was
his
idiosyncrasy
that
these
very
facts
had
produced
within
him
,
in
early
life
,
a
state
of
mind
that
was
not
natural
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
content
to
be
a
High
Churchman
,
if
he
could
be
so
on
principles
of
his
own
and
could
strike
out
a
course
showing
a
marked
difference
from
those
with
whom
he
consorted
.
<EOS>
He
was
ready
to
be
a
partisan
as
long
as
he
was
allowed
to
have
a
course
of
action
and
of
thought
unlike
that
of
his
party
.
<EOS>
His
party
had
indulged
him
,
and
he
began
to
feel
that
his
party
was
right
and
himself
wrong
,
just
when
such
a
conviction
was
too
late
to
be
of
service
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
discovered
,
when
such
discovery
was
no
longer
serviceable
,
that
it
would
have
been
worth
his
while
to
have
worked
for
the
usual
pay
assigned
to
work
in
this
world
and
have
earned
a
wife
and
children
,
with
a
carriage
for
them
to
sit
in
;
to
have
earned
a
pleasant
dining
-
room
,
in
which
his
friends
could
drink
his
wine
,
and
the
power
of
walking
up
the
high
street
of
his
country
town
,
with
the
knowledge
that
all
its
tradesmen
would
have
gladly
welcomed
him
within
their
doors
.
<EOS>
Other
men
arrived
at
those
convictions
in
their
start
in
life
and
so
worked
up
to
them
.
<EOS>
To
him
they
had
come
when
they
were
too
late
to
be
of
use
.
  
<EOS>
It
has
been
said
that
Mr.
Arabin
was
a
man
of
pleasantry
,
and
it
may
be
thought
that
such
a
state
of
mind
as
that
described
would
be
antagonistic
to
humour
.
<EOS>
But
surely
such
is
not
the
case
.
<EOS>
Wit
is
the
outward
mental
casing
of
the
man
,
and
has
no
more
to
do
with
the
inner
mind
of
thoughts
and
feelings
than
have
the
rich
brocaded
garments
of
the
priest
at
the
altar
with
the
asceticism
of
the
anchorite
below
them
,
whose
skin
is
tormented
with
sackcloth
and
whose
body
is
half
-
flayed
with
rods
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
will
not
such
a
one
often
rejoice
more
than
any
other
in
the
rich
show
of
his
outer
apparel
?
<EOS>
Will
it
not
be
food
for
his
pride
to
feel
that
he
groans
inwardly
while
he
shines
outwardly
?
<EOS>
So
it
is
with
the
mental
efforts
which
men
make
.
<EOS>
Those
which
they
show
forth
daily
to
the
world
are
often
the
opposites
of
the
inner
workings
of
the
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
archdeacon
's
drawing
-
room
,
Mr.
Arabin
had
sparkled
with
his
usual
unaffected
brilliancy
,
but
when
he
retired
to
his
bedroom
,
he
sat
there
sad
,
at
his
open
window
,
repining
within
himself
that
he
also
had
no
wife
,
no
bairns
,
no
soft
sward
of
lawn
duly
mown
for
him
to
lie
on
,
no
herd
of
attendant
curates
,
no
bowings
from
the
banker
's
clerks
,
no
rich
rectory
.
<EOS>
That
apostleship
that
he
had
thought
of
had
evaded
his
grasp
,
and
he
was
now
only
vicar
of
St.
Ewold
's
,
with
a
taste
for
a
mitre
.
<EOS>
Truly
he
had
fallen
between
two
stools
.
   
<EOS>
St.
Ewold
's
Parsonage
 
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Harding
and
Mrs.
Bold
reached
the
rectory
on
the
following
morning
,
the
archdeacon
and
his
friend
were
at
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
They
had
gone
over
that
the
new
vicar
might
inspect
his
church
and
be
introduced
to
the
squire
,
and
were
not
expected
back
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
rambled
out
by
himself
and
strolled
,
as
was
his
wo
nt
at
Plumstead
,
about
the
lawn
and
round
the
church
;
and
as
he
did
so
,
the
two
sisters
naturally
fell
into
conversation
about
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
not
much
sisterly
confidence
between
them
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
was
ten
years
older
than
Eleanor
,
and
had
been
married
while
Eleanor
was
yet
a
child
.
<EOS>
They
had
never
,
therefore
,
poured
into
each
other
's
ears
their
hopes
and
loves
;
and
now
that
one
was
a
wife
and
the
other
a
widow
,
it
was
not
probable
that
they
would
begin
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
They
lived
too
much
asunder
to
be
able
to
fall
into
that
kind
of
intercourse
which
makes
confidence
between
sisters
almost
a
necessity
;
moreover
,
that
which
is
so
easy
at
eighteen
is
often
very
difficult
at
twenty
-
eight
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
knew
this
,
and
did
not
,
therefore
,
expect
confidence
from
her
sister
;
yet
she
longed
to
ask
her
whether
in
real
truth
Mr.
Slope
was
agreeable
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
by
no
means
difficult
to
turn
the
conversation
to
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
That
gentleman
had
become
so
famous
at
Barchester
,
had
so
much
to
do
with
all
clergymen
connected
with
the
city
,
and
was
so
specially
concerned
in
the
affairs
of
Mr.
Harding
,
that
it
would
have
been
odd
if
Mr.
Harding
's
daughters
had
not
talked
about
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
was
soon
abusing
him
,
which
she
did
with
her
whole
heart
,
and
Mrs.
Bold
was
nearly
as
eager
to
defend
him
.
<EOS>
She
positively
disliked
the
man
,
would
have
been
delighted
to
learn
that
he
had
taken
himself
off
so
that
she
should
never
see
him
again
,
had
indeed
almost
a
fear
of
him
,
and
yet
she
constantly
found
herself
taking
his
part
.
<EOS>
The
abuse
of
other
people
,
and
abuse
of
a
nature
that
she
felt
to
be
unjust
,
imposed
this
necessity
on
her
,
and
at
last
made
Mr.
Slope
's
defence
an
habitual
course
of
argument
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
From
Mr.
Slope
the
conversation
turned
to
the
Stanhopes
,
and
Mrs.
Grantly
was
listening
with
some
interest
to
Eleanor
's
account
of
the
family
,
when
it
dropped
out
that
Mr.
Slope
made
one
of
the
party
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
the
lady
of
the
rectory
.
"
<EOS>
Was
Mr.
Slope
there
too
?
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
merely
replied
that
such
had
been
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Eleanor
,
he
must
be
very
fond
of
you
,
I
think
;
he
seems
to
follow
you
everywhere
.
"
  
<EOS>
Even
this
did
not
open
Eleanor
's
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
merely
laughed
,
and
said
that
she
imagined
Mr.
Slope
found
other
attraction
at
Dr.
Stanhope
's
.
<EOS>
And
so
they
parted
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
felt
quite
convinced
that
the
odious
match
would
take
place
,
and
Mrs.
Bold
as
convinced
that
that
unfortunate
chaplain
,
disagreeable
as
he
must
be
allowed
to
be
,
was
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
of
course
heard
before
dinner
that
Eleanor
had
remained
the
day
before
in
Barchester
with
the
view
of
meeting
Mr.
Slope
,
and
that
she
had
so
met
him
.
<EOS>
He
remembered
how
she
had
positively
stated
that
there
were
to
be
no
guests
at
the
Stanhopes
,
and
he
did
not
hesitate
to
accuse
her
of
deceit
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
the
fact
,
or
rather
presumed
fact
,
of
her
being
deceitful
on
such
a
matter
spoke
but
too
plainly
in
evidence
against
her
as
to
her
imputed
crime
of
receiving
Mr.
Slope
as
a
lover
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
that
anything
we
can
do
will
be
too
late
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
I
own
I
am
fairly
surprised
.
<EOS>
I
never
liked
your
sister
's
taste
with
regard
to
men
,
but
still
I
did
not
give
her
credit
for
 
ugh
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
so
soon
,
too
,
"
said
Mrs.
Grantly
,
who
thought
more
,
perhaps
,
of
her
sister
's
indecorum
in
having
a
lover
before
she
had
put
off
her
weeds
than
her
bad
taste
in
having
such
a
lover
as
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
I
shall
be
sorry
to
be
harsh
,
or
to
do
anything
that
can
hurt
your
father
;
but
,
positively
,
<EOS>
neither
that
man
nor
his
wife
shall
come
within
my
doors
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
sighed
,
and
then
attempted
to
console
herself
and
her
lord
by
remarking
that
,
after
all
,
the
thing
was
not
accomplished
yet
.
<EOS>
Now
that
Eleanor
was
at
Plumstead
,
much
might
be
done
to
wean
her
from
her
fatal
passion
.
<EOS>
Poor
Eleanor
!
  
<EOS>
The
evening
passed
off
without
anything
to
make
it
remarkable
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
discussed
the
parish
of
St.
Ewold
with
the
archdeacon
,
and
Mrs.
Grantly
and
Mr.
Harding
,
who
knew
the
personages
of
the
parish
,
joined
in
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
also
knew
them
,
but
she
said
little
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
did
not
apparently
take
much
notice
of
her
,
and
she
was
not
in
a
humour
to
receive
at
that
time
with
any
special
grace
any
special
favourite
of
her
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
Her
first
idea
on
reaching
her
bedroom
was
that
a
much
pleasanter
family
party
might
be
met
at
Dr.
Stanhope
's
than
at
the
rectory
.
<EOS>
She
began
to
think
that
she
was
getting
tired
of
clergymen
and
their
respectable
,
humdrum
,
wearisome
mode
of
living
,
and
that
after
all
,
people
in
the
outer
world
,
who
had
lived
in
Italy
,
London
,
or
elsewhere
,
need
not
necessarily
be
regarded
as
atrocious
and
abominable
.
<EOS>
The
Stanhopes
,
she
had
thought
,
were
a
giddy
,
thoughtless
,
extravagant
set
of
people
,
but
she
had
seen
nothing
wrong
about
them
and
had
,
on
the
other
hand
,
found
that
they
thoroughly
knew
how
to
make
their
house
agreeable
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
thousand
pities
,
she
thought
,
that
the
archdeacon
should
not
have
a
little
of
the
same
_
savoir
vivre
_
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
as
we
have
said
,
did
not
apparently
take
much
notice
of
her
,
but
yet
he
did
not
go
to
bed
without
feeling
that
he
had
been
in
company
with
a
very
pretty
woman
;
and
as
is
the
case
with
most
bachelors
,
and
some
married
men
,
regarded
the
prospect
of
his
month
's
visit
at
Plumstead
in
a
pleasanter
light
when
he
learnt
that
a
very
pretty
woman
was
to
share
it
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
Before
they
all
retired
it
was
settled
that
the
whole
party
should
drive
over
on
the
following
day
to
inspect
the
parsonage
at
St.
Ewold
.
<EOS>
The
three
clergymen
were
to
discuss
dilapidations
,
and
the
two
ladies
were
to
lend
their
assistance
in
suggesting
such
changes
as
might
be
necessary
for
a
bachelor
's
abode
.
  
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
soon
after
breakfast
the
carriage
was
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
There
was
only
room
for
four
inside
,
and
the
archdeacon
got
upon
the
box
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
found
herself
opposite
to
Mr.
Arabin
,
and
was
,
therefore
,
in
a
manner
forced
into
conversation
with
him
.
<EOS>
They
were
soon
on
comfortable
terms
together
,
and
had
she
thought
about
it
,
she
would
have
thought
that
,
in
spite
of
his
black
cloth
,
Mr.
Arabin
would
not
have
been
a
bad
addition
to
the
Stanhope
family
party
.
  
<EOS>
Now
that
the
archdeacon
was
away
they
could
all
trifle
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
began
by
telling
them
in
the
most
innocent
manner
imaginable
an
old
legend
about
Mr.
Arabin
's
new
parish
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
he
said
,
in
days
of
yore
an
illustrious
priestess
of
St.
Ewold
,
famed
through
the
whole
country
for
curing
all
manner
of
diseases
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
well
,
as
all
priestesses
have
ever
had
,
which
well
was
extant
to
this
day
,
and
shared
in
the
minds
of
many
of
the
people
the
sanctity
which
belonged
to
the
consecrated
ground
of
the
parish
church
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
declared
that
he
should
look
on
such
tenets
on
the
part
of
his
parishioners
as
anything
but
orthodox
.
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Grantly
replied
that
she
so
entirely
disagreed
with
him
as
to
think
that
no
parish
was
in
a
proper
state
that
had
not
its
priestess
as
well
as
its
priest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
duties
are
never
well
done
,
"
said
she
,
"
unless
they
are
so
divided
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
Papa
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
"
that
in
the
olden
times
the
priestess
bore
all
the
sway
herself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
perhaps
,
thinks
that
such
might
be
too
much
the
case
now
if
a
sacred
lady
were
admitted
within
the
parish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
at
any
rate
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
it
is
safer
to
run
no
such
risk
.
<EOS>
No
priestly
pride
has
ever
exceeded
that
of
sacerdotal
females
.
<EOS>
A
very
lowly
curate
I
might
,
perhaps
,
essay
to
rule
,
but
a
curatess
would
be
sure
to
get
the
better
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
certainly
examples
of
such
accidents
happening
,
"
said
Mrs.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
"
They
do
say
that
there
is
a
priestess
at
Barchester
who
is
very
imperious
in
all
things
touching
the
altar
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
fear
of
such
a
fate
as
that
is
before
your
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
they
were
joined
by
the
archdeacon
on
the
gravel
before
the
vicarage
,
they
descended
again
to
grave
dullness
.
<EOS>
Not
that
Archdeacon
Grantly
was
a
dull
man
,
but
his
frolic
humours
were
of
a
cumbrous
kind
,
and
his
wit
,
when
he
was
witty
,
did
not
generally
extend
itself
to
his
auditors
.
<EOS>
On
the
present
occasion
he
was
soon
making
speeches
about
wounded
roofs
and
walls
,
which
he
declared
to
be
in
want
of
some
surgeon
's
art
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
partition
that
he
did
not
tap
,
nor
a
block
of
chimneys
that
he
did
not
narrowly
examine
;
all
water
-
pipes
,
flues
,
cisterns
,
and
sewers
underwent
an
investigation
;
he
even
descended
,
in
the
care
of
his
friend
,
so
far
as
to
bore
sundry
boards
in
the
floors
with
a
bradawl
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
accompanied
him
through
the
rooms
,
trying
to
look
wise
in
such
domestic
matters
,
and
the
other
three
also
followed
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
showed
that
she
had
not
herself
been
priestess
of
a
parish
twenty
years
for
nothing
,
and
examined
the
bells
and
window
-
panes
in
a
very
knowing
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
,
at
any
rate
,
have
a
beautiful
prospect
out
of
your
own
window
,
if
this
is
to
be
your
private
sanctum
,
"
said
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
She
was
standing
at
the
lattice
of
a
little
room
upstairs
,
from
which
the
view
certainly
was
very
lovely
.
<EOS>
It
was
from
the
back
of
the
vicarage
,
and
there
was
nothing
to
interrupt
the
eye
between
the
house
and
the
glorious
gray
pile
of
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
The
intermediate
ground
,
however
,
was
beautifully
studded
with
timber
.
<EOS>
In
the
immediate
foreground
ran
the
little
river
which
afterwards
skirted
the
city
,
and
,
just
to
the
right
of
the
cathedral
,
the
pointed
gables
and
chimneys
of
Hiram
's
Hospital
peeped
out
of
the
elms
which
encompass
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
he
,
joining
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
a
beautifully
complete
view
of
my
adversaries
.
<EOS>
I
shall
sit
down
before
the
hostile
town
and
fire
away
at
them
at
a
very
pleasant
distance
.
<EOS>
I
shall
just
be
able
to
lodge
a
shot
in
the
hospital
,
should
the
enemy
ever
get
possession
of
it
,
and
as
for
the
palace
,
I
have
it
within
full
range
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
anything
like
you
clergymen
,
"
said
Eleanor
;
"
You
are
always
thinking
of
fighting
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Either
that
,
"
said
he
,
"
or
else
supporting
each
other
.
<EOS>
The
pity
is
that
we
can
not
do
the
one
without
the
other
.
<EOS>
But
are
we
not
here
to
fight
?
<EOS>
Is
not
ours
a
church
militant
?
<EOS>
What
is
all
our
work
but
fighting
,
and
hard
fighting
,
if
it
be
well
done
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
not
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
as
it
may
be
.
<EOS>
The
same
complaint
which
you
make
of
me
for
battling
with
another
clergyman
of
our
own
church
,
the
Mohammedan
would
make
against
me
for
battling
with
the
error
of
a
priest
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
surely
,
you
would
not
be
inclined
to
say
that
I
should
be
wrong
to
do
battle
with
such
as
him
.
<EOS>
A
pagan
,
too
,
with
his
multiplicity
of
gods
,
would
think
it
equally
odd
that
the
Christian
and
the
Mohammedan
should
disagree
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
But
you
wage
your
wars
about
trifles
so
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wars
about
trifles
,
"
said
he
,
"
are
always
bitter
,
especially
among
neighbours
.
<EOS>
When
the
differences
are
great
,
and
the
parties
comparative
strangers
,
men
quarrel
with
courtesy
.
<EOS>
What
combatants
are
ever
so
eager
as
two
brothers
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
do
not
such
contentions
bring
scandal
on
the
church
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
More
scandal
would
fall
on
the
church
if
there
were
no
such
contentions
.
<EOS>
We
have
but
one
way
to
avoid
them
 
by
that
of
acknowledging
a
common
head
of
our
church
,
whose
word
on
all
points
of
doctrine
shall
be
authoritative
.
<EOS>
Such
a
termination
of
our
difficulties
is
alluring
enough
.
<EOS>
It
has
charms
which
are
irresistible
to
many
,
and
all
but
irresistible
,
I
own
,
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
speak
now
of
the
Church
of
Rome
?
"
said
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
he
,
"
not
necessarily
of
the
Church
of
Rome
;
but
of
a
church
with
a
head
.
<EOS>
Had
it
pleased
God
to
vouchsafe
to
us
such
a
church
our
path
would
have
been
easy
.
<EOS>
But
easy
paths
have
not
been
thought
good
for
us
.
"
<EOS>
He
paused
and
stood
silent
for
awhile
,
thinking
of
the
time
when
he
had
so
nearly
sacrificed
all
he
had
,
his
powers
of
mind
,
his
free
agency
,
the
fresh
running
waters
of
his
mind
's
fountain
,
his
very
inner
self
,
for
an
easy
path
in
which
no
fighting
would
be
needed
;
and
then
he
continued
:
"
What
you
say
is
partly
true
:
our
contentions
do
bring
on
us
some
scandal
.
<EOS>
The
outer
world
,
though
it
constantly
reviles
us
for
our
human
infirmities
and
throws
in
our
teeth
the
fact
that
being
clergymen
we
are
still
no
more
than
men
,
demands
of
us
that
we
should
do
our
work
with
godlike
perfection
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
god
-
like
about
us
:
we
differ
from
each
other
with
the
acerbity
common
to
man
;
we
triumph
over
each
other
with
human
frailty
;
we
allow
differences
on
subjects
of
divine
origin
to
produce
among
us
antipathies
and
enmities
which
are
anything
but
divine
.
<EOS>
This
is
all
true
.
<EOS>
But
what
would
you
have
in
place
of
it
?
<EOS>
There
is
no
infallible
head
for
a
church
on
earth
.
<EOS>
This
dream
of
believing
man
has
been
tried
,
and
we
see
in
Italy
and
in
Spain
what
has
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
Grant
that
there
are
and
have
been
no
bickerings
within
the
pale
of
the
Pope
's
Church
.
<EOS>
Such
an
assumption
would
be
utterly
untrue
,
but
let
us
grant
it
,
and
then
let
us
say
which
church
has
incurred
the
heavier
scandals
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
quiet
earnestness
about
Mr.
Arabin
,
as
he
half
-
acknowledged
and
half
-
defended
himself
from
the
charge
brought
against
him
,
which
surprised
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
used
all
her
life
to
listen
to
clerical
discussion
,
but
the
points
at
issue
between
the
disputants
had
so
seldom
been
of
more
than
temporal
significance
as
to
have
left
on
her
mind
no
feeling
of
reverence
for
such
subjects
.
<EOS>
There
had
always
been
a
hard
worldly
leaven
of
the
love
either
of
income
or
of
power
in
the
strains
she
had
heard
;
there
had
been
no
panting
for
the
truth
;
no
aspirations
after
religious
purity
.
<EOS>
It
had
always
been
taken
for
granted
by
those
around
her
that
they
were
indubitably
right
;
that
there
was
no
ground
for
doubt
;
that
the
hard
uphill
work
of
ascertaining
what
the
duty
of
a
clergyman
should
be
had
been
already
accomplished
in
full
;
and
that
what
remained
for
an
active
militant
parson
to
do
was
to
hold
his
own
against
all
comers
.
<EOS>
Her
father
,
it
is
true
,
was
an
exception
to
this
,
but
then
he
was
so
essentially
anti
-
militant
in
all
things
that
she
classed
him
in
her
own
mind
apart
from
all
others
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
argued
the
matter
within
herself
,
or
considered
whether
this
common
tone
was
or
was
not
faulty
;
but
she
was
sick
of
it
without
knowing
that
she
was
so
.
<EOS>
And
now
she
found
to
her
surprise
,
and
not
without
a
certain
pleasurable
excitement
,
that
this
new
-
comer
among
them
spoke
in
a
manner
very
different
from
that
to
which
she
was
accustomed
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
easy
to
condemn
,
"
said
he
,
continuing
the
thread
of
his
thoughts
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
no
life
that
must
be
so
delicious
as
that
of
a
writer
for
newspapers
,
or
a
leading
member
of
the
opposition
 
to
thunder
forth
accusations
against
men
in
power
;
to
show
up
the
worst
side
of
everything
that
is
produced
;
to
pick
holes
in
every
coat
;
to
be
indignant
,
sarcastic
,
jocose
,
moral
,
or
supercilious
;
to
damn
with
faint
praise
,
or
crush
with
open
calumny
!
<EOS>
What
can
be
so
easy
as
this
when
the
critic
has
to
be
responsible
for
nothing
?
<EOS>
You
condemn
what
I
do
,
but
put
yourself
in
my
position
and
do
the
reverse
,
and
then
see
if
I
can
not
condemn
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
I
do
not
condemn
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
you
do
,
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
 
you
as
one
of
the
world
;
you
are
now
the
opposition
member
;
you
are
now
composing
your
leading
article
,
and
well
and
bitterly
you
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
Let
dogs
delight
to
bark
and
bite
"
 
you
fitly
begin
with
an
elegant
quotation
 
"
but
if
we
are
to
have
a
church
at
all
,
in
heaven
's
name
let
the
pastors

it
keep
their
hands
from

throats

Lawyers
can
live
without
befouling
each
other

names
;
doctors
do
not
fight
duels

<EOS>
Why
is
it
that
clergymen
alone
should
indulge
themselves
in
such
unrestrained
liberty
of
abuse
against
each
other

"
<EOS>
and
so
you
go
on
reviling
us
for
our
ungodly
quarrels
,
our
sectarian
propensities
,
and
scandalous
differences

<EOS>
It
will
,
however
,
give
you
no
trouble
to
write
another
article
next
week
in
which
we
,
or
some
of
us
,
shall
be
twitted
with
an
unseemly
apathy
in
matters
of
our
vocation
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
fall
on
you
to
reconcile
the
discrepancy
;
your
readers
will
never
ask
you
how
the
poor
parson
is
to
be
urgent
in
season
and
out
of
season
and
yet
never
come
in
contact
with
men
who
think
widely
differently
from
him
.
<EOS>
You
,
when
you
condemn
this
foreign
treaty
,
or
that
official
arrangement
,
will
have
to
incur
no
blame
for
the
graver
faults
of
any
different
measure
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
easy
to
condemn
 
and
so
pleasant
too
,
for
eulogy
charms
<EOS>
no
listeners
as
detraction
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
only
half
-
followed
him
in
his
raillery
,
but
she
caught
his
meaning
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
ought
to
apologize
for
presuming
to
criticize
you

"
she
said
,
"
but
I
was
thinking
with
sorrow
of
the
ill
-
will
that
has
lately
come
among
us
at
Barchester
,

I
spoke
more
freely
than
I
should
have
done

<EOS>
"
Peace
on
earth
and
goodwill
among
men

are
,
like
heaven
,
promises

"
said
he
,
following
rather
his
own
thoughts
than
hers
.
<EOS>
"
When
that
prophecy
is
accomplished
,
there
will
no
longer
be
any
need
for
clergymen
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
they
were
interrupted
by
the
archdeacon
,
whose
voice
was
heard
from
the
cellar
shouting
to
the
vicar
.
  
<EOS>
"
Arabin

Arabin

and
then
,
turning
to
his
wife
,
who
was
apparently
at
his
elbow
 
<EOS>
"
where
has
he
gone
to
?
<EOS>
This
cellar
is
perfectly
abominable
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
murder
to
put
a
bottle
of
wine
into
it
till
it
has
been
roofed
,
walled
,
and
floored

<EOS>
How
on
earth
old
Goodenough
ever
got
on
with
it
<EOS>
I
can
not
guess
.
<EOS>
But
then
Goodenough
never
had
a
glass
of
wine
that
any
man
could
drink
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
,
Archdeacon
?
"
said
the
vicar
,
running
downstairs
and
leaving
Eleanor
above
to
her
meditations
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
cellar
must
be
roofed
,
walled
,
and
floored
,
"
repeated
the
archdeacon
.
"
<EOS>
Now
mind
what
I
say
,
and
do
n't
let
the
architect
persuade
you
that
it
will
do
;
half
of
these
fellows
know
nothing
about
wine
.
<EOS>
This
place
as
it
is
now
would
be
damp
and
cold
in
winter
and
hot
and
muggy
in
summer
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
give
a
straw
for
the
best
wine
that
ever
was
vinted
,
after
it
had
lain
here
a
couple
of
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
assented
and
promised
that
the
cellar
should
be
reconstructed
according
to
the
archdeacon
's
receipt
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
,
Arabin
,
look
here
;
was
such
an
attempt
at
a
kitchen
grate
ever
seen
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
grate
is
really
very
bad

said
Mrs.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
the
priestess
wo
n't
approve
of
it

Really

Mr.

no

accustomed
to
such
an
excellent
well
as
that
above
could
put
up
with
such
a
grate
as
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
there
must
be
a
priestess
at
St.
Ewold
's
at
all
,
Mrs.
Grantly
,
I
think
we
will
leave
her
to
her
well
and
not
call
down
her
divine
wrath
on
any
of
the
imperfections
rising
from
our
human
poverty
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
own
I
am
amenable
to
the
attractions
of
a
well
-
cooked
dinner
,
and
the
grate
shall
certainly
be
changed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
archdeacon
had
again
ascended
,
and
was
now
in
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Arabin
,
"
said
he
,
speaking
in
his
usual
loud
,
clear
voice
and
with
that
tone
of
dictation
which
was
so
common
to
him
,
"
you
must
positively
alter
this
dining
-
room
 
that
is
,
remodel
it
altogether
.
<EOS>
Look
here
,
it
is
just
sixteen
feet
by
fifteen
;
did
any
man
ever
hear
of
a
dining
-
room
of
such
proportions
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
stepped
the
room
long
-
ways
and
cross
-
ways
with
ponderous
steps
,
as
though
a
certain
amount
of
ecclesiastical
dignity
could
be
imparted
even
to
such
an
occupation
as
that
by
the
manner
of
doing
it
.
"
<EOS>
Barely
sixteen
;
you
may
call
it
a
square
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
do
very
well
for
a
round
table
,
"
suggested
the
ex
-
warden
.
  
<EOS>
Now
there
was
something
peculiarly
unorthodox
,
in
the
archdeacon
's
estimation
,
in
the
idea
of
a
round
table
.
<EOS>
He
had
always
been
accustomed
to
a
goodly
board
of
decent
length
,
comfortably
elongating
itself
according
to
the
number
of
the
guests
,
nearly
black
with
perpetual
rubbing
,
and
as
bright
as
a
mirror
.
<EOS>
Now
round
dinner
-
tables
are
generally
of
oak
,
or
else
of
such
new
construction
as
not
to
have
acquired
the
peculiar
hue
which
was
so
pleasing
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
connected
them
with
what
he
called
the
nasty
newfangled
method
of
leaving
a
cloth
on
the
table
,
as
though
to
warn
people
that
they
were
not
to
sit
long
.
<EOS>
In
his
eyes
there
was
something
democratic
and
parvenu
in
a
round
table
.
<EOS>
He
imagined
that
dissenters
and
calico
-
printers
chiefly
used
them
,
and
perhaps
a
few
literary
lions
more
conspicuous
for
their
wit
than
their
gentility
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
little
flurried
at
the
idea
of
such
an
article
being
introduced
into
the
diocese
by
a
protégé
of
his
own
,
and
at
the
instigation
of
his
father
-
in
-
law
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
round
dinner
-
table
,
"
said
he
with
some
heat
,
"
is
the
most
abominable
article
of
furniture
that
ever
was
invented
.
<EOS>
I
hope
that
Arabin
has
more
taste
than
to
allow
such
a
thing
in
his
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Harding
felt
himself
completely
snubbed
,
and
of
course
said
nothing
further
;
but
Mr.
Arabin
,
who
had
yielded
submissively
in
the
small
matters
of
the
cellar
and
kitchen
grate
,
found
himself
obliged
to
oppose
reforms
which
might
be
of
a
nature
too
expensive
for
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
seems
to
me
,
Archdeacon
,
that
I
ca
n't
very
well
lengthen
the
room
without
pulling
down
the
wall
,
and
if
I
pull
down
the
wall
,
I
must
build
it
up
again
;
then
if
I
throw
out
a
bow
on
this
side
,
I
must
do
the
same
on
the
other
,
and
if
I
do
it
for
the
ground
floor
,
I
must
carry
it
up
to
the
floor
above
.
<EOS>
That
will
be
putting
a
new
front
to
the
house
and
will
cost
,
I
suppose
,
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
The
ecclesiastical
commissioners
will
hardly
assist
me
when
they
hear
that
my
grievance
consists
in
having
a
dining
-
room
only
sixteen
feet
long
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
proceeded
to
explain
that
nothing
would
be
easier
than
adding
six
feet
to
the
front
of
the
dining
-
room
without
touching
any
other
room
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Such
irregularities
of
construction
in
small
country
-
houses
were
,
he
said
,
rather
graceful
than
otherwise
,
and
he
offered
to
pay
for
the
whole
thing
out
of
his
own
pocket
if
it
cost
more
than
forty
pounds
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
however
,
was
firm
,
and
,
although
the
archdeacon
fussed
and
fumed
about
it
,
would
not
give
way
.
<EOS>
Forty
pounds
,
he
said
,
was
a
matter
of
serious
moment
to
him
,
and
his
friends
,
if
under
such
circumstances
they
would
be
good
-
natured
enough
to
come
to
him
at
all
,
must
put
up
with
the
misery
of
a
square
room
.
<EOS>
He
was
willing
to
compromise
matters
by
disclaiming
any
intention
of
having
a
round
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
said
Mrs.
Grantly
,
"
what
if
the
priestess
insists
on
having
both
the
rooms
enlarged
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
priestess
in
that
case
must
do
it
for
herself
,
Mrs.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
she
will
be
well
able
to
do
so
,
"
replied
the
lady
;
"
to
do
that
and
many
more
wonderful
things
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
sure
that
the
priestess
of
St.
Ewold
,
when
she
does
come
,
wo
n't
come
empty
-
handed
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
however
,
did
not
appear
well
inclined
to
enter
into
speculative
expenses
on
such
a
chance
as
this
,
and
therefore
any
material
alterations
in
the
house
,
the
cost
of
which
could
not
fairly
be
made
to
lie
at
the
door
either
of
the
ecclesiastical
commissioners
or
of
the
estate
of
the
late
incumbent
,
were
tabooed
.
<EOS>
With
this
essential
exception
,
the
archdeacon
ordered
,
suggested
,
and
carried
all
points
before
him
in
a
manner
very
much
to
his
own
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
A
close
observer
,
had
there
been
one
there
,
might
have
seen
that
his
wife
had
been
quite
as
useful
in
the
matter
as
himself
.
<EOS>
No
one
knew
better
than
Mrs.
Grantly
the
appurtenances
necessary
to
a
comfortable
house
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
,
however
,
think
it
necessary
to
lay
claim
to
any
of
the
glory
which
her
lord
and
master
was
so
ready
to
appropriate
as
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
Having
gone
through
their
work
effectually
and
systematically
,
the
party
returned
to
Plumstead
well
satisfied
with
their
expedition
.
   
<EOS>
The
Thornes
of
Ullathorne
 
<EOS>
On
the
following
Sunday
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
was
to
read
himself
in
at
his
new
church
.
<EOS>
It
was
agreed
at
the
rectory
that
the
archdeacon
should
go
over
with
him
and
assist
at
the
reading
desk
,
and
that
Mr.
Harding
should
take
the
archdeacon
's
duty
at
Plumstead
Church
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
had
her
school
and
her
buns
to
attend
to
,
and
professed
that
she
could
not
be
spared
,
but
Mrs.
Bold
was
to
accompany
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
further
agreed
also
that
they
would
lunch
at
the
squire
's
house
and
return
home
after
the
afternoon
service
.
  
<EOS>
Wilfred
Thorne
,
Esq
.
,
of
Ullathorne
,
was
the
squire
of
St.
Ewold
's
 
or
,
rather
,
the
squire
of
Ullathorne
,
for
the
domain
of
the
modern
landlord
was
of
wider
notoriety
than
the
fame
of
the
ancient
saint
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
fair
specimen
of
what
that
race
has
come
to
in
our
days
which
,
a
century
ago
,
was
,
as
we
are
told
,
fairly
represented
by
Squire
Western
.
<EOS>
If
that
representation
be
a
true
one
,
few
classes
of
men
can
have
made
faster
strides
in
improvement
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
,
however
,
was
a
man
possessed
of
quite
a
sufficient
number
of
foibles
to
lay
him
open
to
much
ridicule
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
a
bachelor
,
being
about
fifty
,
and
was
not
a
little
proud
of
his
person
.
<EOS>
When
living
at
home
at
Ullathorne
,
there
was
not
much
room
for
such
pride
,
and
there
therefore
he
always
looked
like
a
gentleman
and
like
that
which
he
certainly
was
,
the
first
man
in
his
parish
.
<EOS>
But
during
the
month
or
six
weeks
which
he
annually
spent
in
London
,
he
tried
so
hard
to
look
like
a
great
man
there
also
,
which
he
certainly
was
not
,
that
he
was
put
down
as
a
fool
by
many
at
his
club
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
of
considerable
literary
attainment
in
a
certain
way
and
on
certain
subjects
.
<EOS>
His
favourite
authors
were
Montaigne
and
Burton
,
and
he
knew
more
perhaps
than
any
other
man
in
his
own
county
and
the
next
to
it
of
the
English
essayists
of
the
two
last
centuries
.
<EOS>
He
possessed
complete
sets
of
the
Idler
,
the
Spectator
,
the
Tatler
,
the
Guardian
,
and
the
Rambler
,
and
would
discourse
by
hours
together
on
the
superiority
of
such
publications
to
anything
which
has
since
been
produced
in
our
Edinburghs
and
Quarterlies
.
<EOS>
He
was
proficient
in
all
questions
of
genealogy
,
and
knew
enough
of
almost
every
gentleman
's
family
in
England
to
say
of
what
blood
and
lineage
were
descended
all
those
who
had
any
claim
to
be
considered
as
possessors
of
any
such
luxuries
.
<EOS>
For
blood
and
lineage
he
himself
had
a
most
profound
respect
.
<EOS>
He
counted
back
his
own
ancestors
to
some
period
long
antecedent
to
the
Conquest
,
and
could
tell
you
,
if
you
would
listen
to
him
,
how
it
had
come
to
pass
that
they
,
like
Cedric
the
Saxon
,
had
been
permitted
to
hold
their
own
among
the
Norman
barons
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
,
according
to
his
showing
,
on
account
of
any
weak
complaisance
on
the
part
of
his
family
towards
their
Norman
neighbours
.
<EOS>
Some
Ealfried
of
Ullathorne
once
fortified
his
own
castle
and
held
out
,
not
only
that
,
but
the
then
existing
cathedral
of
Barchester
also
,
against
one
Geoffrey
De
Burgh
,
in
the
time
of
King
John
;
and
Mr.
Thorne
possessed
the
whole
history
of
the
siege
written
on
vellum
and
illuminated
in
a
most
costly
manner
.
<EOS>
It
little
signified
that
no
one
could
read
the
writing
,
as
,
had
that
been
possible
,
no
one
could
have
understood
the
language
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
could
,
however
,
give
you
all
the
particulars
in
good
English
,
and
had
no
objection
to
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
unjust
to
say
that
he
looked
down
on
men
whose
families
were
of
recent
date
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
frequently
consorted
with
such
,
and
had
chosen
many
of
his
friends
from
among
them
.
<EOS>
But
he
looked
on
them
as
great
millionaires
are
apt
to
look
on
those
who
have
small
incomes
;
as
men
who
have
Sophocles
at
their
fingers
"
ends
regard
those
who
know
nothing
of
Greek
.
<EOS>
They
might
doubtless
be
good
sort
of
people
,
entitled
to
much
praise
for
virtue
,
very
admirable
for
talent
,
highly
respectable
in
every
way
,
but
they
were
without
the
one
great
good
gift
.
<EOS>
Such
was
Mr.
Thorne
's
way
of
thinking
on
this
matter
<EOS>
;
nothing
could
atone
for
the
loss
of
good
blood
;
nothing
could
neutralize
its
good
effects
.
<EOS>
Few
indeed
were
now
possessed
of
it
,
but
the
possession
was
on
that
account
the
more
precious
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
pleasant
to
hear
Mr.
Thorne
descant
on
this
matter
.
<EOS>
Were
you
in
your
ignorance
to
surmise
that
such
a
one
was
of
a
good
family
because
the
head
of
his
family
was
a
baronet
of
an
old
date
,
he
would
open
his
eyes
with
a
delightful
look
of
affected
surprise
,
and
modestly
remind
you
that
baronetcies
only
dated
from
James
I.
<EOS>
He
would
gently
sigh
if
you
spoke
of
the
blood
of
the
Fitzgeralds
and
De
Burghs
;
would
hardly
allow
the
claims
of
the
Howards
and
Lowthers
;
and
has
before
now
alluded
to
the
Talbots
as
a
family
who
had
hardly
yet
achieved
the
full
honours
of
a
pedigree
.
  
<EOS>
In
speaking
once
of
a
wide
-
spread
race
whose
name
had
received
the
honours
of
three
coronets
,
scions
from
which
sat
for
various
constituencies
,
some
one
of
whose
members
had
been
in
almost
every
cabinet
formed
during
the
present
century
,
a
brilliant
race
such
as
there
are
few
in
England
,
Mr.
Thorne
had
called
them
all
"
dirt
.
"
<EOS>
He
had
not
intended
any
disrespect
to
these
men
.
<EOS>
He
admired
them
in
many
senses
,
and
allowed
them
their
privileges
without
envy
.
<EOS>
He
had
merely
meant
to
express
his
feeling
that
the
streams
which
ran
through
their
veins
were
not
yet
purified
by
time
to
that
perfection
,
had
not
become
so
genuine
an
ichor
,
as
to
be
worthy
of
being
called
blood
in
the
genealogical
sense
.
  
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Arabin
was
first
introduced
to
him
,
Mr.
Thorne
had
immediately
suggested
that
he
was
one
of
the
Arabins
of
Uphill
Stanton
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
replied
that
he
was
a
very
distant
relative
of
the
family
alluded
to
.
<EOS>
To
this
Mr.
Thorne
surmised
that
the
relationship
could
not
be
very
distant
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
assured
him
that
it
was
so
distant
that
the
families
knew
nothing
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
laughed
his
gentle
laugh
at
this
and
told
Mr.
Arabin
that
there
was
now
existing
no
branch
of
his
family
separated
from
the
parent
stock
at
an
earlier
date
than
the
reign
of
Elizabeth
,
and
that
therefore
Mr.
Arabin
could
not
call
himself
distant
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
himself
was
quite
clearly
an
Arabin
of
Uphill
Stanton
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
said
the
vicar
,
"
Uphill
Stanton
has
been
sold
to
the
De
Greys
and
has
been
in
their
hands
for
the
last
fifty
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
when
it
has
been
there
one
hundred
and
fifty
,
if
it
unluckily
remain
there
so
long
,
"
said
Mr.
Thorne
,
"
your
descendants
will
not
be
a
whit
the
less
entitled
to
describe
themselves
as
being
of
the
family
of
Uphill
Stanton
.
<EOS>
Thank
God
no
De
Grey
can
buy
that
 
and
thank
God
no
Arabin
,
and
no
Thorne
,
can
sell
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
politics
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
was
an
unflinching
conservative
.
<EOS>
He
looked
on
those
fifty
-
three
Trojans
who
,
as
Mr.
Dod
tells
us
,
censured
free
trade
in
November
,
1852
,
as
the
only
patriots
left
among
the
public
men
of
England
.
<EOS>
When
that
terrible
crisis
of
free
trade
had
arrived
,
when
the
repeal
of
the
Corn
Laws
was
carried
by
those
very
men
whom
Mr.
Thorne
had
hitherto
regarded
as
the
only
possible
saviours
of
his
country
,
he
was
for
a
time
paralysed
.
<EOS>
His
country
was
lost
;
but
that
was
comparatively
a
small
thing
.
<EOS>
Other
countries
had
flourished
and
fallen
,
and
the
human
race
still
went
on
improving
under
God
's
providence
.
<EOS>
But
now
all
trust
in
human
faith
must
forever
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
Not
only
must
ruin
come
,
but
it
must
come
through
the
apostasy
of
those
who
had
been
regarded
as
the
truest
of
true
believers
.
<EOS>
Politics
in
England
,
as
a
pursuit
for
gentlemen
,
must
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
Had
Mr.
Thorne
been
trodden
under
foot
by
a
Whig
,
he
could
have
borne
it
as
a
Tory
and
a
martyr
,
but
to
be
so
utterly
thrown
over
and
deceived
by
those
he
had
so
earnestly
supported
,
so
thoroughly
trusted
,
was
more
than
he
could
endure
and
live
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
ceased
to
live
as
a
politician
,
and
refused
to
hold
any
converse
with
the
world
at
large
on
the
state
of
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
Such
were
Mr.
Thorne
's
impressions
for
the
first
two
or
three
years
after
Sir
Robert
Peel
's
apostasy
,
but
by
degrees
his
temper
,
as
did
that
of
others
,
cooled
down
.
<EOS>
He
began
once
more
to
move
about
,
to
frequent
the
bench
and
the
market
,
and
to
be
seen
at
dinners
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
some
of
those
who
had
so
cruelly
betrayed
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
necessity
for
him
to
live
,
and
that
plan
of
his
for
avoiding
the
world
did
not
answer
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
and
others
around
him
who
still
maintained
the
same
staunch
principles
of
protection
 
men
like
himself
who
were
too
true
to
flinch
at
the
cry
of
a
mob
 
had
their
own
way
of
consoling
themselves
.
<EOS>
They
were
,
and
felt
themselves
to
be
,
the
only
true
depositaries
left
of
certain
Eleusinian
mysteries
,
of
certain
deep
and
wondrous
services
of
worship
by
which
alone
the
gods
could
be
rightly
approached
.
<EOS>
To
them
and
them
only
was
it
now
given
to
know
these
things
and
to
perpetuate
them
,
if
that
might
still
be
done
,
by
the
careful
and
secret
education
of
their
children
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
read
how
private
and
peculiar
forms
of
worship
have
been
carried
on
from
age
to
age
in
families
which
,
to
the
outer
world
,
have
apparently
adhered
to
the
services
of
some
ordinary
church
.
<EOS>
And
so
by
degrees
it
was
with
Mr.
Thorne
.
<EOS>
He
learnt
at
length
to
listen
calmly
while
protection
was
talked
of
as
a
thing
dead
,
although
he
knew
within
himself
that
it
was
still
quick
with
a
mystic
life
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
without
a
certain
pleasure
that
such
knowledge
,
though
given
to
him
,
should
be
debarred
from
the
multitude
.
<EOS>
He
became
accustomed
to
hear
even
among
country
gentlemen
that
free
trade
was
after
all
not
so
bad
,
and
to
hear
this
without
dispute
,
although
conscious
within
himself
that
everything
good
in
England
had
gone
with
his
old
palladium
.
<EOS>
He
had
within
him
something
of
the
feeling
of
Cato
,
who
gloried
that
he
could
kill
himself
because
Romans
were
no
longer
worthy
of
their
name
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
had
no
thought
of
killing
himself
,
being
a
Christian
and
still
possessing
his
£
4000
a
year
,
but
the
feeling
was
not
on
that
account
the
less
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
was
a
sportsman
,
and
had
been
active
though
not
outrageous
in
his
sports
.
<EOS>
Previous
to
the
great
downfall
of
politics
in
his
county
,
he
had
supported
the
hunt
by
every
means
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
He
had
preserved
game
till
no
goose
or
turkey
could
show
a
tail
in
the
parish
of
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
He
had
planted
gorse
covers
with
more
care
than
oaks
and
larches
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
more
anxious
for
the
comfort
of
his
foxes
than
of
his
ewes
and
lambs
.
<EOS>
No
meet
had
been
more
popular
than
Ullathorne
;
no
man
's
stables
had
been
more
liberally
open
to
the
horses
of
distant
men
than
Mr.
Thorne
's
;
no
man
had
said
more
,
written
more
,
or
done
more
to
keep
the
club
up
.
<EOS>
The
theory
of
protection
could
expand
itself
so
thoroughly
in
the
practices
of
a
county
hunt
!
<EOS>
But
when
the
great
ruin
came
;
when
the
noble
master
of
the
Barsetshire
hounds
supported
the
recreant
minister
in
the
House
of
Lords
and
basely
surrendered
his
truth
,
his
manhood
,
his
friends
,
and
his
honour
for
the
hope
of
a
garter
,
then
Mr.
Thorne
gave
up
the
hunt
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
cut
his
covers
,
for
that
would
not
have
been
the
act
of
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
kill
his
foxes
,
for
that
according
to
his
light
would
have
been
murder
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
say
that
his
covers
should
not
be
drawn
,
or
his
earths
stopped
,
for
that
would
have
been
illegal
according
to
the
by
-
laws
prevailing
among
country
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
But
he
absented
himself
from
home
on
the
occasion
of
every
meet
at
Ullathorne
,
left
the
covers
to
their
fate
,
and
could
not
be
persuaded
to
take
his
pink
coat
out
of
his
press
,
or
his
hunters
out
of
his
stable
.
<EOS>
This
lasted
for
two
years
,
and
then
by
degrees
he
came
round
.
<EOS>
He
first
appeared
at
a
neighbouring
meet
on
a
pony
,
dressed
in
his
shooting
-
coat
,
as
though
he
had
trotted
in
by
accident
;
then
he
walked
up
one
morning
on
foot
to
see
his
favourite
gorse
drawn
,
and
when
his
groom
brought
his
mare
out
by
chance
,
he
did
not
refuse
to
mount
her
.
<EOS>
He
was
next
persuaded
,
by
one
of
the
immortal
fifty
-
three
,
to
bring
his
hunting
materials
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
county
and
take
a
fortnight
with
the
hounds
there
;
and
so
gradually
he
returned
to
his
old
life
.
<EOS>
But
in
hunting
as
in
other
things
he
was
only
supported
by
an
inward
feeling
of
mystic
superiority
to
those
with
whom
he
shared
the
common
breath
of
outer
life
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
did
not
live
in
solitude
at
Ullathorne
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
sister
,
who
was
ten
years
older
than
himself
and
who
participated
in
his
prejudices
and
feelings
so
strongly
that
she
was
a
living
caricature
of
all
his
foibles
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
open
a
modern
quarterly
,
did
not
choose
to
see
a
magazine
in
her
drawing
-
room
,
and
would
not
have
polluted
her
fingers
with
a
shred
of
the
Times
for
any
consideration
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
of
Addison
,
Swift
,
and
Steele
as
though
they
were
still
living
,
regarded
Defoe
as
the
best
known
novelist
of
his
country
,
and
thought
of
Fielding
as
a
young
but
meritorious
novice
in
the
fields
of
romance
.
<EOS>
In
poetry
,
she
was
familiar
with
names
as
late
as
Dryden
,
and
had
once
been
seduced
into
reading
"
The
Rape
of
the
Lock
;
"
but
she
regarded
Spenser
as
the
purest
type
of
her
country
's
literature
in
this
line
.
<EOS>
Genealogy
was
her
favourite
insanity
.
<EOS>
Those
things
which
are
the
pride
of
most
genealogists
were
to
her
contemptible
.
<EOS>
Arms
and
mottoes
set
her
beside
herself
.
<EOS>
Ealfried
of
Ullathorne
had
wanted
no
motto
to
assist
him
in
cleaving
to
the
brisket
Geoffrey
De
Burgh
,
and
Ealfried
's
great
grandfather
,
the
gigantic
Ullafrid
,
had
required
no
other
arms
than
those
which
nature
gave
him
to
hurl
from
the
top
of
his
own
castle
a
cousin
of
the
base
invading
Norman
.
<EOS>
To
her
all
modern
English
names
were
equally
insignificant
:
<EOS>
Hengist
,
Horsa
,
and
such
like
had
for
her
ears
the
only
true
savour
of
nobility
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
contented
unless
she
could
go
beyond
the
Saxons
,
and
would
certainly
have
christened
her
children
,
had
she
had
children
,
by
the
names
of
the
ancient
Britons
.
<EOS>
In
some
respects
she
was
not
unlike
Scott
's
Ulrica
,
and
had
she
been
given
to
cursing
,
she
would
certainly
have
done
so
in
the
names
of
Mista
,
Skogula
,
and
Zernebock
.
<EOS>
Not
having
submitted
to
the
embraces
of
any
polluting
Norman
,
as
poor
Ulrica
had
done
,
and
having
assisted
no
parricide
,
the
milk
of
human
kindness
was
not
curdled
in
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
She
never
cursed
therefore
,
but
blessed
rather
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
she
did
in
a
strange
uncouth
Saxon
manner
that
would
have
been
unintelligible
to
any
peasants
but
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
As
a
politician
,
Miss
Thorne
had
been
so
thoroughly
disgusted
with
public
life
by
base
deeds
long
antecedent
to
the
Corn
Law
question
that
that
had
but
little
moved
her
.
<EOS>
In
her
estimation
her
brother
had
been
a
fast
young
man
,
hurried
away
by
a
too
ardent
temperament
into
democratic
tendencies
.
<EOS>
Now
happily
he
was
brought
to
sounder
views
by
seeing
the
iniquity
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
yet
reconciled
herself
to
the
Reform
Bill
,
and
still
groaned
in
spirit
over
the
defalcations
of
the
Duke
as
touching
the
Catholic
Emancipation
.
<EOS>
If
asked
whom
she
thought
the
Queen
should
take
as
her
counsellor
,
she
would
probably
have
named
Lord
Eldon
,
and
when
reminded
that
that
venerable
man
was
no
longer
present
in
the
flesh
to
assist
us
,
she
would
probably
have
answered
with
a
sigh
that
none
now
could
help
us
but
the
dead
.
  
<EOS>
In
religion
Miss
Thorne
was
a
pure
Druidess
.
<EOS>
We
would
not
have
it
understood
by
that
<EOS>
that
she
did
actually
in
these
latter
days
assist
at
any
human
sacrifices
,
or
that
she
was
in
fact
hostile
to
the
Church
of
Christ
.
<EOS>
She
had
adopted
the
Christian
religion
as
a
milder
form
of
the
worship
of
her
ancestors
,
and
always
appealed
to
her
doing
so
as
evidence
that
she
had
no
prejudices
against
reform
,
when
it
could
be
shown
that
reform
was
salutary
.
<EOS>
This
reform
was
the
most
modern
of
any
to
which
she
had
as
yet
acceded
,
it
being
presumed
that
British
ladies
had
given
up
their
paint
and
taken
to
some
sort
of
petticoats
before
the
days
of
St.
Augustine
.
<EOS>
That
further
feminine
step
in
advance
which
combines
paint
and
petticoats
together
had
not
found
a
votary
in
Miss
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
was
a
Druidess
in
this
,
that
she
regretted
she
knew
not
what
in
the
usages
and
practices
of
her
Church
.
<EOS>
She
sometimes
talked
and
constantly
thought
of
good
things
gone
by
,
though
she
had
but
the
faintest
idea
of
what
those
good
things
had
been
.
<EOS>
She
imagined
that
a
purity
had
existed
which
was
now
gone
,
that
a
piety
had
adorned
our
pastors
and
a
simple
docility
our
people
,
for
which
it
may
be
feared
history
gave
her
but
little
true
warrant
.
<EOS>
She
was
accustomed
to
speak
of
Cranmer
as
though
he
had
been
the
firmest
and
most
simple
-
minded
of
martyrs
,
and
of
Elizabeth
as
though
the
pure
Protestant
faith
of
her
people
had
been
the
one
anxiety
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
cruel
to
undeceive
her
,
had
it
been
possible
;
but
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
make
her
believe
that
the
one
was
a
time
-
serving
priest
,
willing
to
go
any
length
to
keep
his
place
,
and
that
the
other
was
in
heart
a
papist
,
with
this
sole
proviso
,
that
she
should
be
her
own
pope
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
Miss
Thorne
went
on
sighing
and
regretting
,
looking
back
to
the
divine
right
of
kings
as
the
ruling
axiom
of
a
golden
age
,
and
cherishing
,
low
down
in
the
bottom
of
her
heart
of
hearts
,
a
dear
unmentioned
wish
for
the
restoration
of
some
exiled
Stuart
.
<EOS>
Who
would
deny
her
the
luxury
of
her
sighs
,
or
the
sweetness
of
her
soft
regrets
!
  
<EOS>
In
her
person
and
her
dress
she
was
perfect
,
and
well
she
knew
her
own
perfection
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
small
,
elegantly
made
old
woman
,
with
a
face
from
which
the
glow
of
her
youth
had
not
departed
without
leaving
some
streaks
of
a
roseate
hue
.
<EOS>
She
was
proud
of
her
colour
,
proud
of
her
grey
hair
which
she
wore
in
short
crisp
curls
peering
out
all
around
her
face
from
her
dainty
white
lace
cap
.
<EOS>
To
think
of
all
the
money
that
she
spent
in
lace
used
to
break
the
heart
of
poor
Mrs.
Quiverful
with
her
seven
daughters
.
<EOS>
She
was
proud
of
her
teeth
,
which
were
still
white
and
numerous
,
proud
of
her
bright
cheery
eye
,
proud
of
her
short
jaunty
step
;
and
very
proud
of
the
neat
,
precise
,
small
feet
with
which
those
steps
were
taken
.
<EOS>
She
was
proud
also
,
ay
,
very
proud
,
of
the
rich
brocaded
silk
in
which
it
was
her
custom
to
ruffle
through
her
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
We
know
what
was
the
custom
of
the
lady
of
Branksome
    
Nine
-
and
-
twenty
knights
of
fame
Hung
their
shields
in
Branksome
Hall
.
  
<EOS>
The
lady
of
Ullathorne
was
not
so
martial
in
her
habits
,
but
hardly
less
costly
.
<EOS>
She
might
have
boasted
that
nine
-
and
-
twenty
silken
skirts
might
have
been
produced
in
her
chamber
,
each
fit
to
stand
alone
.
<EOS>
The
nine
-
and
-
twenty
shields
of
the
Scottish
heroes
were
less
independent
and
hardly
more
potent
to
withstand
any
attack
that
might
be
made
on
them
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
when
fully
dressed
might
be
said
to
have
been
armed
cap
-
a
-
pie
,
and
she
was
always
fully
dressed
,
as
far
as
was
ever
known
to
mortal
man
.
  
<EOS>
For
all
this
rich
attire
Miss
Thorne
was
not
indebted
to
the
generosity
of
her
brother
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
very
comfortable
independence
of
her
own
,
which
she
divided
among
juvenile
relatives
,
the
milliners
,
and
the
poor
,
giving
much
the
largest
share
to
the
latter
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
imagined
,
therefore
,
that
with
all
her
little
follies
she
was
not
unpopular
.
<EOS>
All
her
follies
have
,
we
believe
,
been
told
.
<EOS>
Her
virtues
were
too
numerous
to
describe
,
and
not
sufficiently
interesting
to
deserve
description
.
  
<EOS>
While
we
are
on
the
subject
of
the
Thornes
,
one
word
must
be
said
of
the
house
they
lived
in
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
large
house
,
nor
a
fine
house
,
nor
perhaps
to
modern
ideas
a
very
commodious
house
,
but
by
those
who
love
the
peculiar
colour
and
peculiar
ornaments
of
genuine
Tudor
architecture
it
was
considered
a
perfect
gem
.
<EOS>
We
beg
to
own
ourselves
among
the
number
,
and
therefore
take
this
opportunity
to
express
our
surprise
that
so
little
is
known
by
English
men
and
women
of
the
beauties
of
English
architecture
.
<EOS>
The
ruins
of
the
Colosseum
,
the
Campanile
at
Florence
,
<EOS>
St.
Mark
's
,
Cologne
,
the
Bourse
and
Notre
Dame
are
with
our
tourists
as
familiar
as
household
words
;
but
they
know
nothing
of
the
glories
of
Wiltshire
,
Dorsetshire
,
and
Somersetshire
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
we
much
question
whether
many
noted
travellers
,
men
who
have
pitched
their
tents
perhaps
under
Mount
Sinai
,
are
not
still
ignorant
that
there
are
glories
in
Wiltshire
,
Dorsetshire
,
and
Somersetshire
.
<EOS>
We
beg
that
they
will
go
and
see
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
's
house
was
called
Ullathorne
Court
 
and
was
properly
so
called
,
for
the
house
itself
formed
two
sides
of
a
quadrangle
,
which
was
completed
on
the
other
two
sides
by
a
wall
about
twenty
feet
high
.
<EOS>
This
wall
was
built
of
cut
stone
,
rudely
cut
indeed
,
and
now
much
worn
,
but
of
a
beautiful
,
rich
,
tawny
yellow
colour
,
the
effect
of
that
stonecrop
of
minute
growth
which
it
had
taken
three
centuries
to
produce
.
<EOS>
The
top
of
this
wall
was
ornamented
by
huge
,
round
stone
balls
of
the
same
colour
as
the
wall
itself
.
<EOS>
Entrance
into
the
court
was
had
through
a
pair
of
iron
gates
so
massive
that
no
one
could
comfortably
open
or
close
them
 
consequently
,
they
were
rarely
disturbed
.
<EOS>
From
the
gateway
two
paths
led
obliquely
across
the
court
:
<EOS>
that
to
the
left
reaching
the
hall
-
door
,
which
was
in
the
corner
made
by
the
angle
of
the
house
,
and
that
to
the
right
leading
to
the
back
entrance
,
which
was
at
the
further
end
of
the
longer
portion
of
the
building
.
  
<EOS>
With
those
who
are
now
adepts
in
contriving
house
accommodation
,
it
will
militate
much
against
Ullathorne
Court
that
no
carriage
could
be
brought
to
the
hall
-
door
.
<EOS>
If
you
enter
Ullathorne
at
all
,
you
must
do
so
,
fair
reader
,
on
foot
,
or
at
least
in
a
bath
-
chair
.
<EOS>
No
vehicle
drawn
by
horses
ever
comes
within
that
iron
gate
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
nothing
to
the
next
horror
that
will
encounter
you
.
<EOS>
On
entering
the
front
door
,
which
you
do
by
no
very
grand
portal
,
you
find
yourself
immediately
in
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
What
,
no
hall
?
<EOS>
exclaims
my
luxurious
friend
,
accustomed
to
all
the
comfortable
appurtenances
of
modern
life
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
kind
sir
,
a
noble
hall
,
if
you
will
but
observe
it
;
a
true
old
English
hall
of
excellent
dimensions
for
a
country
gentleman
's
family
;
but
,
if
you
please
,
no
dining
-
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
Both
Mr.
and
Miss
Thorne
were
proud
of
this
peculiarity
of
their
dwelling
,
though
the
brother
was
once
all
but
tempted
by
his
friends
to
alter
it
.
<EOS>
They
delighted
in
the
knowledge
that
they
,
like
Cedric
,
positively
dined
in
their
true
hall
,
even
though
they
so
dined
_
tête
-
à
-
tête
_
.
<EOS>
But
though
they
had
never
owned
,
they
had
felt
and
endeavoured
to
remedy
the
discomfort
of
such
an
arrangement
.
<EOS>
A
huge
screen
partitioned
off
the
front
door
and
a
portion
of
the
hall
,
and
from
the
angle
so
screened
off
a
second
door
led
into
a
passage
which
ran
along
the
larger
side
of
the
house
next
to
the
courtyard
.
<EOS>
Either
my
reader
or
I
must
be
a
bad
hand
at
topography
,
if
it
be
not
clear
that
the
great
hall
forms
the
ground
-
floor
of
the
smaller
portion
of
the
mansion
,
that
which
was
to
your
left
as
you
entered
the
iron
gate
,
and
that
it
occupies
the
whole
of
this
wing
of
the
building
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
equally
clear
that
it
looks
out
on
a
trim
mown
lawn
,
through
three
quadrangular
windows
with
stone
mullions
,
each
window
divided
into
a
larger
portion
at
the
bottom
,
and
a
smaller
portion
at
the
top
,
and
each
portion
again
divided
into
five
by
perpendicular
stone
supporters
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
windows
which
give
a
better
light
than
such
as
these
,
and
it
may
be
,
as
my
utilitarian
friend
observes
,
that
the
giving
of
light
is
the
desired
object
of
a
window
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
argue
the
point
with
him
.
<EOS>
Indeed
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
not
the
less
die
in
the
assured
conviction
that
no
sort
or
description
of
window
is
capable
of
imparting
half
so
much
happiness
to
mankind
as
that
which
had
been
adopted
at
Ullathorne
Court
.
<EOS>
What
,
not
an
oriel
?
<EOS>
says
Miss
Diana
de
Midellage
.
<EOS>
No
,
Miss
Diana
,
not
even
an
oriel
,
beautiful
as
is
an
oriel
window
.
<EOS>
It
has
not
about
it
<EOS>
so
perfect
a
feeling
of
quiet
English
homely
comfort
.
<EOS>
Let
oriel
windows
grace
a
college
,
or
the
half
-
public
mansion
of
a
potent
peer
,
but
for
the
sitting
room
of
quiet
country
ladies
,
of
ordinary
homely
folk
,
nothing
can
equal
the
square
,
mullioned
windows
of
the
Tudor
architects
.
  
<EOS>
The
hall
was
hung
round
with
family
female
insipidities
by
Lely
and
unprepossessing
male
Thornes
in
red
coats
by
Kneller
,
each
Thorne
having
been
let
into
a
panel
in
the
wainscoting
,
in
the
proper
manner
.
<EOS>
At
the
further
end
of
the
room
was
a
huge
fire
-
place
,
which
afforded
much
ground
of
difference
between
the
brother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
An
antiquated
grate
that
would
hold
about
a
hundredweight
of
coal
,
had
been
stuck
on
to
the
hearth
by
Mr.
Thorne
's
father
.
<EOS>
This
hearth
had
of
course
been
intended
for
the
consumption
of
wood
faggots
,
and
the
iron
dogs
for
the
purpose
were
still
standing
,
though
half
-
buried
in
the
masonry
of
the
grate
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
was
very
anxious
to
revert
to
the
dogs
.
<EOS>
The
dear
good
old
creature
was
always
glad
to
revert
to
anything
,
and
had
she
been
systematically
indulged
,
would
doubtless
in
time
have
reflected
that
fingers
were
made
before
forks
and
have
reverted
accordingly
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
affairs
of
the
fire
-
place
Mr.
Thorne
would
not
revert
.
<EOS>
Country
gentlemen
around
him
all
had
comfortable
grates
in
their
dining
-
rooms
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
exactly
the
man
to
have
suggested
a
modern
usage
,
but
he
was
not
so
far
prejudiced
as
to
banish
those
which
his
father
had
prepared
for
his
use
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
had
indeed
once
suggested
that
with
very
little
contrivance
the
front
door
might
have
been
so
altered
as
to
open
at
least
into
the
passage
,
but
on
hearing
this
,
his
sister
Monica
 
such
was
Miss
Thorne
's
name
 
had
been
taken
ill
and
had
remained
so
for
a
week
.
<EOS>
Before
she
came
downstairs
she
received
a
pledge
from
her
brother
that
the
entrance
should
never
be
changed
in
her
lifetime
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
the
hall
opposite
to
the
fire
-
place
a
door
led
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
which
was
of
equal
size
,
and
lighted
with
precisely
similar
windows
.
<EOS>
But
yet
the
aspect
of
the
room
was
very
different
.
<EOS>
It
was
papered
,
and
the
ceiling
,
which
in
the
hall
showed
the
old
rafters
,
was
whitened
and
finished
with
a
modern
cornice
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
's
drawing
-
room
,
or
,
as
she
always
called
it
,
withdrawing
-
room
,
was
a
beautiful
apartment
.
<EOS>
The
windows
opened
on
to
the
full
extent
of
the
lovely
trim
garden
;
immediately
before
the
windows
were
plots
of
flowers
in
stiff
,
stately
,
stubborn
little
beds
,
each
bed
surrounded
by
a
stone
coping
of
its
own
;
beyond
,
there
was
a
low
parapet
wall
on
which
stood
urns
and
images
,
fawns
,
nymphs
,
satyrs
,
and
a
whole
tribe
of
Pan
's
followers
;
and
then
again
,
beyond
that
,
a
beautiful
lawn
sloped
away
to
a
sunk
fence
which
divided
the
garden
from
the
park
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
's
study
was
at
the
end
of
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
beyond
that
were
the
kitchen
and
the
offices
.
<EOS>
Doors
opened
into
both
Miss
Thorne
's
withdrawing
-
room
and
Mr.
Thorne
's
sanctum
from
the
passage
above
alluded
to
,
which
,
as
it
came
to
the
latter
room
,
widened
itself
so
as
to
make
space
for
the
huge
black
oak
stairs
which
led
to
the
upper
regions
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
the
interior
of
Ullathorne
Court
.
<EOS>
But
having
thus
described
it
,
perhaps
somewhat
too
tediously
,
we
beg
to
say
that
it
is
not
the
interior
to
which
we
wish
to
call
the
English
tourist
's
attention
,
though
we
advise
him
to
lose
no
legitimate
opportunity
of
becoming
acquainted
with
it
in
a
friendly
manner
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
outside
of
Ullathorne
that
is
so
lovely
.
<EOS>
Let
the
tourist
get
admission
at
least
into
the
garden
and
fling
himself
on
that
soft
sward
just
opposite
to
the
exterior
angle
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
will
there
get
the
double
frontage
and
enjoy
that
which
is
so
lovely
 
<EOS>
the
expanse
of
architectural
beauty
without
the
formal
dullness
of
one
long
line
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
the
colour
of
Ullathorne
that
is
so
remarkable
.
<EOS>
It
is
of
that
delicious
tawny
hue
which
no
stone
can
give
,
unless
it
has
on
it
the
vegetable
richness
of
centuries
.
<EOS>
Strike
the
wall
with
your
hand
,
and
you
will
think
that
the
stone
has
on
it
no
covering
,
but
rub
it
carefully
,
and
you
will
find
that
the
colour
comes
off
upon
your
finger
.
<EOS>
No
colourist
that
ever
yet
worked
from
a
palette
has
been
able
to
come
up
to
this
rich
colouring
of
years
crowding
themselves
on
years
.
  
<EOS>
Ullathorne
is
a
high
building
for
a
country
-
house
,
for
it
possesses
three
stories
,
and
in
each
story
the
windows
are
of
the
same
sort
as
that
described
,
though
varying
in
size
and
varying
also
in
their
lines
athwart
the
house
.
<EOS>
Those
of
the
ground
floor
are
all
uniform
in
size
and
position
.
<EOS>
But
those
above
are
irregular
both
in
size
and
place
,
and
this
irregularity
gives
a
bizarre
and
not
unpicturesque
appearance
to
the
building
.
<EOS>
Along
the
top
,
on
every
side
,
runs
a
low
parapet
,
which
nearly
hides
the
roof
,
and
at
the
corners
are
more
figures
of
fawns
and
satyrs
.
  
<EOS>
Such
is
Ullathorne
House
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
say
one
word
of
the
approach
to
it
,
which
shall
include
all
the
description
which
we
mean
to
give
of
the
church
also
.
<EOS>
The
picturesque
old
church
of
St.
Ewold
's
stands
immediately
opposite
to
the
iron
gates
which
open
into
the
court
,
and
is
all
but
surrounded
by
the
branches
of
the
lime
-
trees
which
form
the
avenue
leading
up
to
the
house
from
both
sides
.
<EOS>
This
avenue
is
magnificent
,
but
it
would
lose
much
of
its
value
in
the
eyes
of
many
proprietors
by
the
fact
that
the
road
through
it
is
not
private
property
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
public
lane
between
hedgerows
,
with
a
broad
grass
margin
on
each
side
of
the
road
,
from
which
the
lime
-
trees
spring
.
<EOS>
Ullathorne
Court
,
therefore
,
does
not
stand
absolutely
surrounded
by
its
own
grounds
,
though
Mr.
Thorne
is
owner
of
all
the
adjacent
land
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
is
the
source
of
very
little
annoyance
to
him
.
<EOS>
Men
,
when
they
are
acquiring
property
,
think
much
of
such
things
,
but
they
who
live
where
their
ancestors
have
lived
for
years
do
not
feel
the
misfortune
.
<EOS>
It
never
occurred
either
to
Mr.
or
Miss
Thorne
that
they
were
not
sufficiently
private
because
the
world
at
large
might
,
if
it
so
wished
,
walk
or
drive
by
their
iron
gates
.
<EOS>
That
part
of
the
world
which
availed
itself
of
the
privilege
was
however
very
small
.
  
<EOS>
Such
a
year
or
two
since
were
the
Thornes
of
Ullathorne
.
<EOS>
Such
,
we
believe
,
are
the
inhabitants
of
many
an
English
country
-
home
.
<EOS>
May
it
be
long
before
their
number
diminishes
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
Reads
Himself
in
at
St.
Ewold
's
 
<EOS>
On
the
Sunday
morning
the
archdeacon
with
his
sister
-
in
-
law
and
Mr.
Arabin
drove
over
to
Ullathorne
,
as
had
been
arranged
.
<EOS>
On
their
way
thither
the
new
vicar
declared
himself
to
be
considerably
disturbed
in
his
mind
at
the
idea
of
thus
facing
his
parishioners
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
he
said
,
been
always
subject
to
_
mauvaise
honte
_
and
an
annoying
degree
of
bashfulness
,
which
often
unfitted
him
for
any
work
of
a
novel
description
;
and
now
he
felt
this
so
strongly
that
he
feared
he
should
acquit
himself
badly
in
St.
Ewold
's
reading
-
desk
.
<EOS>
He
knew
,
he
said
,
that
those
sharp
little
eyes
of
Miss
Thorne
would
be
on
him
,
and
that
they
would
not
approve
.
<EOS>
All
this
the
archdeacon
greatly
ridiculed
.
<EOS>
He
himself
knew
not
,
and
had
never
known
,
what
it
was
to
be
shy
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
conceive
that
Miss
Thorne
,
surrounded
as
she
would
be
by
the
peasants
of
Ullathorne
and
a
few
of
the
poorer
inhabitants
of
the
suburbs
of
Barchester
,
could
in
any
way
affect
the
composure
of
a
man
well
accustomed
to
address
the
learned
congregation
of
St.
Mary
's
at
Oxford
,
and
he
laughed
accordingly
at
the
idea
of
Mr.
Arabin
's
modesty
.
  
<EOS>
Thereupon
Mr.
Arabin
commenced
to
subtilize
.
<EOS>
The
change
,
he
said
,
from
St.
Mary
's
to
St.
Ewold
's
was
quite
as
powerful
on
the
spirits
as
would
be
that
from
St.
Ewold
's
to
St.
Mary
's
.
<EOS>
Would
not
a
peer
who
,
by
chance
of
fortune
,
might
suddenly
be
driven
to
herd
among
navvies
be
as
afraid
of
the
jeers
of
his
companions
as
would
any
navvy
suddenly
exalted
to
a
seat
among
the
peers
?
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
archdeacon
declared
with
a
loud
laugh
that
he
would
tell
Miss
Thorne
that
her
new
minister
had
likened
her
to
a
navvy
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
however
,
pronounced
such
a
conclusion
to
be
unfair
;
a
comparison
might
be
very
just
in
its
proportions
which
did
not
at
all
assimilate
the
things
compared
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Arabin
went
on
subtilizing
,
regarding
neither
the
archdeacon
's
raillery
nor
Eleanor
's
defence
.
<EOS>
A
young
lady
,
he
said
,
would
execute
with
most
perfect
self
-
possession
a
difficult
piece
of
music
in
a
room
crowded
with
strangers
,
who
would
not
be
able
to
express
herself
in
intelligible
language
,
even
on
any
ordinary
subject
and
among
her
most
intimate
friends
,
if
she
were
required
to
do
so
standing
on
a
box
somewhat
elevated
among
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
an
affair
of
education
,
and
he
at
forty
found
it
difficult
to
educate
himself
anew
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
dissented
on
the
matter
of
the
box
,
and
averred
she
could
speak
very
well
about
dresses
,
or
babies
,
or
legs
of
mutton
from
any
box
,
<EOS>
provided
it
were
big
enough
for
her
to
stand
upon
without
fear
,
even
though
all
her
friends
were
listening
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
was
sure
she
would
not
be
able
to
say
a
word
,
but
this
proved
nothing
in
favour
of
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
said
that
he
would
try
the
question
out
with
Mrs.
Bold
,
and
get
her
on
a
box
some
day
when
the
rectory
might
be
full
of
visitors
.
<EOS>
To
this
Eleanor
assented
,
making
condition
that
the
visitors
should
be
of
their
own
set
,
and
the
archdeacon
cogitated
in
his
mind
whether
by
such
a
condition
it
was
intended
that
Mr.
Slope
should
be
included
,
resolving
also
that
,
if
so
,
the
trial
would
certainly
never
take
place
in
the
rectory
drawing
-
room
at
Plumstead
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
arguing
,
they
drove
up
to
the
iron
gates
of
Ullathorne
Court
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Miss
Thorne
were
standing
ready
dressed
for
church
in
the
hall
,
and
greeted
their
clerical
visitors
with
cordiality
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
was
an
old
favourite
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
clergyman
of
the
old
school
,
and
this
recommended
him
to
the
lady
.
<EOS>
He
had
always
been
an
opponent
of
free
trade
as
long
as
free
trade
was
an
open
question
,
and
now
that
it
was
no
longer
so
,
he
,
being
a
clergyman
,
had
not
been
obliged
,
like
most
of
his
lay
Tory
companions
,
to
read
his
recantation
.
<EOS>
He
could
therefore
be
regarded
as
a
supporter
of
the
immaculate
fifty
-
three
,
and
was
on
this
account
a
favourite
with
Mr.
Thorne
.
<EOS>
The
little
bell
was
tinkling
,
and
the
rural
population
of
the
parish
were
standing
about
the
lane
,
leaning
on
the
church
-
stile
and
against
the
walls
of
the
old
court
,
anxious
to
get
a
look
at
their
new
minister
as
he
passed
from
the
house
to
the
rectory
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
's
servant
had
already
preceded
them
thither
with
the
vestments
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
went
forth
together
,
and
when
the
ladies
passed
into
the
church
,
the
three
gentlemen
tarried
a
moment
in
the
lane
,
that
Mr.
Thorne
might
name
to
the
vicar
with
some
kind
of
one
-
sided
introduction
the
most
leading
among
his
parishioners
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
are
our
churchwardens
,
Mr.
Arabin
 
Farmer
Greenacre
and
Mr.
Stiles
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Stiles
has
the
mill
as
you
go
into
Barchester
;
and
very
good
churchwardens
they
are
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
very
severe
,
I
hope
,
"
said
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
The
two
ecclesiastical
officers
touched
their
hats
,
and
each
made
a
leg
in
the
approved
rural
fashion
,
assuring
the
vicar
that
they
were
very
glad
to
have
the
honour
of
seeing
him
,
and
adding
that
the
weather
was
very
good
for
the
harvest
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Stiles
,
being
a
man
somewhat
versed
in
town
life
,
had
an
impression
of
his
own
dignity
,
and
did
not
quite
like
leaving
his
pastor
under
the
erroneous
idea
that
he
being
a
churchwarden
kept
the
children
in
order
during
church
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twas
thus
he
understood
Mr.
Arabin
's
allusion
to
his
severity
and
hastened
to
put
matters
right
by
observing
that
"
Sexton
Clodheve
looked
to
the
younguns
,
and
perhaps
sometimes
there
may
be
a
thought
too
much
stick
going
on
during
sermon
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
's
bright
eye
twinkled
as
he
caught
that
of
the
archdeacon
,
and
he
smiled
to
himself
as
he
observed
how
ignorant
his
officers
were
of
the
nature
of
their
authority
and
of
the
surveillance
which
it
was
their
duty
to
keep
even
over
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
read
the
lessons
and
preached
.
<EOS>
It
was
enough
to
put
a
man
a
little
out
,
let
him
have
been
ever
so
used
to
pulpit
reading
,
to
see
the
knowing
way
in
which
the
farmers
cocked
their
ears
and
set
about
a
mental
criticism
as
to
whether
their
new
minister
did
or
did
not
fall
short
of
the
excellence
of
him
who
had
lately
departed
from
them
.
<EOS>
A
mental
and
silent
criticism
it
was
for
the
existing
moment
,
but
soon
to
be
made
public
among
the
elders
of
St.
Ewold
's
over
the
green
graves
of
their
children
and
forefathers
.
<EOS>
The
excellence
,
however
,
of
poor
old
Mr.
Goodenough
had
not
been
wonderful
,
and
there
were
few
there
who
did
not
deem
that
Mr.
Arabin
did
his
work
sufficiently
well
,
in
spite
of
the
slightly
nervous
affliction
which
at
first
impeded
him
,
and
which
nearly
drove
the
archdeacon
beside
himself
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
sermon
was
the
thing
to
try
the
man
.
<EOS>
It
often
surprises
us
that
very
young
men
can
muster
courage
to
preach
for
the
first
time
to
a
strange
congregation
.
<EOS>
Men
who
are
as
yet
but
little
more
than
boys
,
who
have
but
just
left
what
indeed
we
may
not
call
a
school
,
but
a
seminary
intended
for
their
tuition
as
scholars
,
whose
thoughts
have
been
mostly
of
boating
,
cricketing
,
and
wine
-
parties
,
ascend
a
rostrum
high
above
the
heads
of
the
submissive
crowd
,
not
that
they
may
read
God
's
word
to
those
below
,
but
that
they
may
preach
their
own
word
for
the
edification
of
their
hearers
.
<EOS>
It
seems
strange
to
us
that
they
are
not
stricken
dumb
by
the
new
and
awful
solemnity
of
their
position
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
am
I
,
just
turned
twenty
-
three
,
who
have
never
yet
passed
ten
thoughtful
days
since
the
power
of
thought
first
came
to
me
,
how
am
I
to
instruct
these
greybeards
who
,
with
the
weary
thinking
of
so
many
years
,
have
approached
so
near
the
grave
?
<EOS>
Can
I
teach
them
their
duty
?
<EOS>
Can
I
explain
to
them
that
which
I
so
imperfectly
understand
,
that
which
years
of
study
may
have
made
so
plain
to
them
?
<EOS>
Has
my
newly
acquired
privilege
as
one
of
God
's
ministers
imparted
to
me
as
yet
any
fitness
for
the
wonderful
work
of
a
preacher
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
supposed
that
such
ideas
do
occur
to
young
clergymen
,
and
yet
they
overcome
,
apparently
with
ease
,
this
difficulty
which
to
us
appears
to
be
all
but
insurmountable
.
<EOS>
We
have
never
been
subjected
in
the
way
of
ordination
to
the
power
of
a
bishop
's
hands
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
there
is
in
them
something
that
sustains
the
spirit
and
banishes
the
natural
modesty
of
youth
.
<EOS>
But
for
ourselves
we
must
own
that
the
deep
affection
which
Dominie
Sampson
felt
for
his
young
pupils
has
not
more
endeared
him
to
us
than
the
bashful
spirit
which
sent
him
mute
and
inglorious
from
the
pulpit
when
he
rose
there
with
the
futile
attempt
to
preach
God
's
gospel
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
rule
in
our
church
which
forbids
the
younger
order
of
our
clergymen
to
perform
a
certain
portion
of
the
service
.
<EOS>
The
absolution
must
be
read
by
a
minister
in
priest
's
orders
.
<EOS>
If
there
be
no
such
minister
present
,
the
congregation
can
have
the
benefit
of
no
absolution
but
that
which
each
may
succeed
in
administering
to
himself
.
<EOS>
The
rule
may
be
a
good
one
,
though
the
necessity
for
it
hardly
comes
home
to
the
general
understanding
.
<EOS>
But
this
forbearance
on
the
part
of
youth
would
be
much
more
appreciated
if
it
were
extended
likewise
to
sermons
.
<EOS>
The
only
danger
would
be
that
congregations
would
be
too
anxious
to
prevent
their
young
clergymen
from
advancing
themselves
in
the
ranks
of
the
ministry
.
<EOS>
Clergymen
who
could
not
preach
would
be
such
blessings
that
they
would
be
bribed
to
adhere
to
their
incompetence
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
however
,
had
not
the
modesty
of
youth
to
impede
him
,
and
he
succeeded
with
his
sermon
even
better
than
with
the
lessons
.
<EOS>
He
took
for
his
text
two
verses
out
of
the
second
epistle
of
St.
John
,
"
Whosoever
transgresseth
,
and
abideth
not
in
the
doctrine
of
Christ
,
hath
not
God
.
<EOS>
He
that
abideth
in
the
doctrine
of
Christ
,
he
hath
both
the
Father
and
the
Son
.
<EOS>
If
there
come
any
unto
you
,
and
bring
not
this
doctrine
,
receive
him
not
into
your
house
,
neither
bid
him
God
-
speed
.
"
<EOS>
He
told
them
that
the
house
of
theirs
to
which
he
alluded
was
this
their
church
,
in
which
he
now
addressed
them
for
the
first
time
;
that
their
most
welcome
and
proper
manner
of
bidding
him
God
-
speed
would
be
their
patient
obedience
to
his
teaching
of
the
gospel
;
but
that
he
could
put
forward
no
claim
to
such
conduct
on
their
part
unless
he
taught
them
the
great
Christian
doctrine
of
works
and
faith
combined
.
<EOS>
On
this
he
enlarged
,
but
not
very
amply
,
and
after
twenty
minutes
succeeded
in
sending
his
new
friends
home
to
their
baked
mutton
and
pudding
well
pleased
with
their
new
minister
.
  
<EOS>
Then
came
the
lunch
at
Ullathorne
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
were
in
the
hall
Miss
Thorne
took
Mr.
Arabin
's
hand
and
assured
him
that
she
received
him
into
her
house
,
into
the
temple
,
she
said
,
in
which
she
worshipped
,
and
bade
him
God
-
speed
with
all
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
was
touched
and
squeezed
the
spinster
's
hand
without
uttering
a
word
in
reply
.
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Thorne
expressed
a
hope
that
Mr.
Arabin
found
the
church
well
adapted
for
articulation
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
having
replied
that
he
had
no
doubt
he
should
as
soon
as
he
had
learnt
to
pitch
his
voice
to
the
building
,
they
all
sat
down
to
the
good
things
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
took
special
care
of
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
still
wore
her
widow
's
weeds
,
and
therefore
had
about
her
that
air
of
grave
and
sad
maternity
which
is
the
lot
of
recent
widows
.
<EOS>
This
opened
the
soft
heart
of
Miss
Thorne
,
and
made
her
look
on
her
young
guest
as
though
too
much
could
not
be
done
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
heaped
chicken
and
ham
upon
her
plate
and
poured
out
for
her
a
full
bumper
of
port
wine
.
<EOS>
When
Eleanor
,
who
was
not
sorry
to
get
it
,
had
drunk
a
little
of
it
,
Miss
Thorne
at
once
essayed
to
fill
it
again
.
<EOS>
To
this
Eleanor
objected
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
winked
and
nodded
and
whispered
,
saying
that
it
was
the
proper
thing
and
must
be
done
,
and
that
she
knew
all
about
it
;
and
so
she
desired
Mrs.
Bold
to
drink
it
up
and
not
mind
anybody
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
your
duty
,
you
know
,
to
support
yourself
,
"
she
said
into
the
ear
of
the
young
mother
;
"
there
's
more
than
yourself
depending
on
it
;
"
and
thus
she
coshered
up
Eleanor
with
cold
fowl
and
port
wine
.
<EOS>
How
it
is
that
poor
men
's
wives
,
who
have
no
cold
fowl
and
port
wine
on
which
to
be
coshered
up
,
nurse
their
children
without
difficulty
,
whereas
the
wives
of
rich
men
,
who
eat
and
drink
everything
that
is
good
,
can
not
do
so
,
we
will
for
the
present
leave
to
the
doctors
and
the
mothers
to
settle
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
Miss
Thorne
was
great
about
teeth
.
<EOS>
Little
Johnny
Bold
had
been
troubled
for
the
last
few
days
with
his
first
incipient
masticator
,
and
with
that
freemasonry
which
exists
among
ladies
,
Miss
Thorne
became
aware
of
the
fact
before
Eleanor
had
half
-
finished
her
wing
.
<EOS>
The
old
lady
prescribed
at
once
a
receipt
which
had
been
much
in
vogue
in
the
young
days
of
her
grandmother
,
and
warned
Eleanor
with
solemn
voice
against
the
fallacies
of
modern
medicine
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
his
coral
,
my
dear
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
rub
it
well
with
carrot
-
juice
;
rub
it
till
the
juice
dries
on
it
,
and
then
give
it
him
to
play
with
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
he
has
n't
got
a
coral
,
"
said
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
got
a
coral
!
"
said
Miss
Thorne
with
almost
angry
vehemence
.
<EOS>
"
Not
got
a
coral
 
<EOS>
how
can
you
expect
that
he
should
cut
his
teeth
?
<EOS>
Have
you
got
Daffy
's
Elixir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
explained
that
she
had
not
.
<EOS>
It
had
not
been
ordered
by
Mr.
Rerechild
,
the
Barchester
doctor
whom
she
employed
;
and
then
the
young
mother
mentioned
some
shockingly
modern
succedaneum
which
Mr.
Rerechild
's
new
lights
had
taught
him
to
recommend
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
looked
awfully
severe
.
"
<EOS>
Take
care
,
my
dear
,
"
said
she
,
"
that
the
man
knows
what
he
's
about
<EOS>
;
take
care
he
does
n't
destroy
your
little
boy
.
<EOS>
But
"
 
and
she
softened
into
sorrow
,
as
she
said
it
,
and
spoke
more
in
pity
than
in
anger
 
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
know
who
there
is
in
Barchester
now
that
you
can
trust
.
<EOS>
Poor
dear
old
Doctor
Bumpwell
,
indeed
 
"
  
"
Why
,
Miss
Thorne
,
he
died
when
I
was
a
little
girl
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
he
did
,
and
an
unfortunate
day
it
was
for
Barchester
.
<EOS>
As
to
those
young
men
that
have
come
up
since
"
 
Mr.
Rerechild
,
by
the
by
,
was
quite
as
old
as
Miss
Thorne
herself
 
"
one
does
n't
know
where
they
came
from
or
who
they
are
,
or
whether
they
know
anything
about
their
business
or
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
are
very
clever
men
in
Barchester
,
"
said
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
there
may
be
;
only
I
do
n't
know
them
:
and
it
's
admitted
on
all
sides
that
medical
men
are
n't
now
what
they
used
to
be
.
<EOS>
They
used
to
be
talented
,
observing
,
educated
men
.
<EOS>
But
now
any
whipper
-
snapper
out
of
an
apothecary
's
shop
can
call
himself
a
doctor
.
<EOS>
I
believe
no
kind
of
education
is
now
thought
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
was
herself
the
widow
of
a
medical
man
and
felt
a
little
inclined
to
resent
all
these
hard
sayings
.
<EOS>
But
Miss
Thorne
was
so
essentially
good
-
natured
that
it
was
impossible
to
resent
anything
she
said
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
sipped
her
wine
and
finished
her
chicken
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
my
dear
,
do
n't
forget
the
carrot
-
juice
,
and
by
all
means
get
him
a
coral
at
once
.
<EOS>
My
grandmother
Thorne
had
the
best
teeth
in
the
county
and
carried
them
to
the
grave
with
her
at
eighty
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
her
say
it
was
all
the
carrot
-
juice
.
<EOS>
She
could
n't
bear
the
Barchester
doctors
.
<EOS>
Even
poor
old
Dr.
Bumpwell
did
n't
please
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
clearly
never
occurred
to
Miss
Thorne
that
some
fifty
years
ago
Dr.
Bumpwell
was
only
a
rising
man
and
therefore
as
much
in
need
of
character
in
the
eyes
of
the
then
ladies
of
Ullathorne
as
the
present
doctors
were
in
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
made
a
very
good
lunch
,
and
talked
to
his
host
about
turnip
-
drillers
and
new
machines
for
reaping
,
while
the
host
,
thinking
it
only
polite
to
attend
to
a
stranger
,
and
fearing
that
perhaps
he
might
not
care
about
turnip
crops
on
a
Sunday
,
mooted
all
manner
of
ecclesiastical
subjects
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
a
heavier
lot
of
wheat
,
Thorne
,
than
you
've
got
there
in
that
field
beyond
the
copse
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
that
's
guano
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
guano
.
<EOS>
I
get
it
from
Bristol
myself
.
<EOS>
You
'll
find
you
often
have
a
tolerable
congregation
of
Barchester
people
out
here
,
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
They
are
very
fond
of
St.
Ewold
's
,
particularly
of
an
afternoon
when
the
weather
is
not
too
hot
for
the
walk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
under
an
obligation
to
them
for
staying
away
to
-
day
,
at
any
rate
,
"
said
the
vicar
.
<EOS>
"
The
congregation
can
never
be
too
small
for
a
maiden
sermon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
got
a
ton
and
a
half
at
Bradley
's
in
High
Street
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
"
and
it
was
a
complete
take
in
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
there
was
five
hundredweight
of
guano
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
Bradley
never
has
anything
good
,
"
said
Miss
Thorne
,
who
had
just
caught
the
name
during
her
whisperings
with
Eleanor
.
"
<EOS>
And
such
a
nice
shop
as
there
used
to
be
in
that
very
house
before
he
came
.
<EOS>
Wilfred
<EOS>
,
do
n't
you
remember
what
good
things
<EOS>
old
Ambleoff
used
to
have
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
have
been
three
men
since
Ambleoff
's
time
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
"
and
each
as
bad
as
the
other
.
<EOS>
But
who
gets
it
for
you
at
Bristol
,
Thorne
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ran
up
myself
this
year
and
bought
it
out
of
the
ship
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
as
the
evenings
get
shorter
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
you
'll
find
the
reading
-
desk
too
dark
.
<EOS>
I
must
send
a
fellow
with
an
axe
and
make
him
lop
off
some
of
those
branches
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
declared
that
the
morning
light
at
any
rate
was
perfect
,
and
deprecated
any
interference
with
the
lime
-
trees
.
<EOS>
And
then
they
took
a
stroll
out
among
the
trim
parterres
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
explained
to
Mrs.
Bold
the
difference
between
a
naiad
and
a
dryad
,
and
dilated
on
vases
and
the
shapes
of
urns
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
busied
herself
among
her
pansies
,
and
her
brother
,
finding
it
quite
impracticable
to
give
anything
of
a
peculiarly
Sunday
tone
to
the
conversation
,
abandoned
the
attempt
and
had
it
out
with
the
archdeacon
about
the
Bristol
guano
.
  
<EOS>
At
three
o'clock
they
again
went
into
church
,
and
now
Mr.
Arabin
read
the
service
and
the
archdeacon
preached
.
<EOS>
Nearly
the
same
congregation
was
present
,
with
some
adventurous
pedestrians
from
the
city
,
who
had
not
thought
the
heat
of
the
midday
August
sun
too
great
to
deter
them
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
took
his
text
from
the
epistle
to
Philemon
.
<EOS>
"
I
beseech
thee
for
my
son
Onesimus
,
whom
I
have
begotten
in
my
bonds
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
From
such
a
text
it
may
be
imagined
the
kind
of
sermon
which
Dr.
Grantly
preached
,
and
on
the
whole
it
was
neither
dull
,
nor
bad
,
nor
out
of
place
.
  
<EOS>
He
told
them
that
it
had
become
his
duty
to
look
about
for
a
pastor
for
them
,
to
supply
the
place
of
one
who
had
been
long
among
them
,
and
that
in
this
manner
he
regarded
as
a
son
him
whom
he
had
selected
,
as
St.
Paul
had
regarded
the
young
disciple
whom
he
sent
forth
.
<EOS>
Then
he
took
a
little
merit
to
himself
for
having
studiously
provided
the
best
man
he
could
without
reference
to
patronage
or
favour
;
but
he
did
not
say
that
the
best
man
according
to
his
views
was
he
who
was
best
able
to
subdue
Mr.
Slope
,
and
make
that
gentleman
's
situation
in
Barchester
too
hot
to
be
comfortable
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
bonds
,
they
had
consisted
in
the
exceeding
struggle
which
he
had
made
to
get
a
good
clergyman
for
them
.
<EOS>
He
deprecated
any
comparison
between
himself
and
St.
Paul
,
but
said
that
he
was
entitled
to
beseech
them
for
their
goodwill
towards
Mr.
Arabin
,
in
the
same
manner
that
the
apostle
had
besought
Philemon
and
his
household
with
regard
to
Onesimus
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
's
sermon
 
text
,
blessing
,
and
all
 
was
concluded
within
the
half
-
hour
.
<EOS>
Then
they
shook
hands
with
their
Ullathorne
friends
and
returned
to
Plumstead
.
"
<EOS>
Twas
thus
that
Mr.
Arabin
read
himself
in
at
St.
Ewold
's
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
Manages
Matters
Very
Cleverly
at
Puddingdale
 
<EOS>
The
next
two
weeks
passed
pleasantly
enough
at
Plumstead
.
<EOS>
The
whole
party
there
assembled
seemed
to
get
on
well
together
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
made
the
house
agreeable
,
and
the
archdeacon
and
Mr.
Grantly
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
iniquity
as
regarded
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
had
his
violoncello
,
and
played
to
them
while
his
daughters
accompanied
him
.
<EOS>
Johnny
Bold
,
by
the
help
either
of
Mr.
Rerechild
or
else
by
that
of
his
coral
and
carrot
-
juice
,
got
through
his
teething
troubles
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
gaieties
,
too
,
of
all
sorts
.
<EOS>
They
had
dined
at
Ullathorne
,
and
the
Thornes
had
dined
at
the
rectory
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
had
been
duly
put
to
stand
on
her
box
,
and
in
that
position
had
found
herself
quite
unable
to
express
her
opinion
on
the
merits
of
flounces
,
such
having
been
the
subject
given
to
try
her
elocution
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
had
of
course
been
much
in
his
own
parish
,
looking
to
the
doings
at
his
vicarage
,
calling
on
his
parishioners
,
and
taking
on
himself
the
duties
of
his
new
calling
.
<EOS>
But
still
he
had
been
every
evening
at
Plumstead
,
and
Mrs.
Grantly
was
partly
willing
to
agree
with
her
husband
that
he
was
a
pleasant
inmate
in
a
house
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
also
been
at
a
dinner
-
party
at
Dr.
Stanhope
's
,
of
which
Mr.
Arabin
had
made
one
.
<EOS>
He
also
,
mothlike
,
burnt
his
wings
in
the
flames
of
the
signora
's
candle
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
,
too
,
had
been
there
,
and
had
felt
somewhat
displeased
with
the
taste
 
want
of
taste
she
called
it
 
shown
by
Mr.
Arabin
in
paying
so
much
attention
to
Madame
Neroni
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
infallible
that
Madeline
should
displease
and
irritate
the
women
as
that
she
should
charm
and
captivate
the
men
.
<EOS>
The
one
result
followed
naturally
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
true
that
Mr.
Arabin
had
been
charmed
.
<EOS>
He
thought
her
a
very
clever
and
a
very
handsome
woman
;
he
thought
also
that
her
peculiar
affliction
entitled
her
to
the
sympathy
of
all
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
,
he
said
,
met
so
much
suffering
joined
to
such
perfect
beauty
and
so
clear
a
mind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twas
thus
he
spoke
of
the
signora
,
coming
home
in
the
archdeacon
's
carriage
,
and
Eleanor
by
no
means
liked
to
hear
the
praise
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
however
,
exceedingly
unjust
of
her
to
be
angry
with
Mr.
Arabin
,
as
she
had
herself
spent
a
very
pleasant
evening
with
Bertie
Stanhope
,
who
had
taken
her
down
to
dinner
and
had
not
left
her
side
for
one
moment
after
the
gentlemen
came
out
of
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
It
was
unfair
that
she
should
amuse
herself
with
Bertie
and
yet
begrudge
her
new
friend
his
license
of
amusing
himself
with
Bertie
's
sister
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
did
so
.
<EOS>
She
was
half
-
angry
with
him
in
the
carriage
,
and
said
something
about
meretricious
manners
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
did
not
understand
the
ways
of
women
very
well
,
or
else
he
might
have
flattered
himself
that
Eleanor
was
in
love
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
Eleanor
was
not
in
love
with
him
.
<EOS>
How
many
shades
there
are
between
love
and
indifference
,
and
how
little
the
graduated
scale
is
understood
!
<EOS>
She
had
now
been
nearly
three
weeks
in
the
same
house
with
Mr.
Arabin
,
and
had
received
much
of
his
attention
and
listened
daily
to
his
conversation
.
<EOS>
He
had
usually
devoted
at
least
some
portion
of
his
evening
to
her
exclusively
.
<EOS>
At
Dr.
Stanhope
's
he
had
devoted
himself
exclusively
to
another
.
<EOS>
It
does
not
require
that
a
woman
should
be
in
love
to
be
irritated
at
this
;
it
does
not
require
that
she
should
even
acknowledge
to
herself
that
it
is
unpleasant
to
her
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
had
no
such
self
-
knowledge
.
<EOS>
She
thought
in
her
own
heart
that
it
was
only
on
Mr.
Arabin
's
account
that
she
regretted
that
he
could
condescend
to
be
amused
by
the
signora
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
he
had
more
mind
,
"
she
said
to
herself
as
she
sat
watching
her
baby
's
cradle
on
her
return
from
the
party
.
"
<EOS>
After
all
,
I
believe
Mr.
Stanhope
is
the
pleasanter
man
of
the
two
.
"
<EOS>
Alas
for
the
memory
of
poor
John
Bold
!
<EOS>
Eleanor
was
not
in
love
with
Bertie
Stanhope
,
nor
was
she
in
love
with
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
But
her
devotion
to
her
late
husband
was
fast
fading
when
she
could
revolve
in
her
mind
,
over
the
cradle
of
his
infant
,
the
faults
and
failings
of
other
aspirants
to
her
favour
.
  
<EOS>
Will
anyone
blame
my
heroine
for
this
?
<EOS>
Let
him
or
her
rather
thank
God
for
all
His
goodness
 
for
His
mercy
endureth
forever
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
in
truth
,
was
not
in
love
;
neither
was
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
Neither
indeed
was
Bertie
Stanhope
,
though
he
had
already
found
occasion
to
say
nearly
as
much
as
that
he
was
.
<EOS>
The
widow
's
cap
had
prevented
him
from
making
a
positive
declaration
,
when
otherwise
he
would
have
considered
himself
entitled
to
do
so
on
a
third
or
fourth
interview
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
after
all
,
but
a
small
cap
now
,
and
had
but
little
of
the
weeping
willow
left
in
its
construction
.
<EOS>
It
is
singular
how
these
emblems
of
grief
fade
away
by
unseen
gradations
.
<EOS>
Each
pretends
to
be
the
counterpart
of
the
forerunner
,
and
yet
the
last
little
bit
of
crimped
white
crape
that
sits
so
jauntily
on
the
back
of
the
head
is
as
dissimilar
to
the
first
huge
mountain
of
woe
which
disfigured
the
face
of
the
weeper
as
the
state
of
the
Hindu
is
to
the
jointure
of
the
English
dowager
.
  
<EOS>
But
let
it
be
clearly
understood
that
Eleanor
was
in
love
with
no
one
,
and
that
no
one
was
in
love
with
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
her
anger
against
Mr.
Arabin
did
not
last
long
,
and
before
two
days
were
over
they
were
both
as
good
friends
as
ever
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
like
him
,
for
every
hour
spent
in
his
company
was
spent
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
could
not
quite
like
him
,
for
there
was
always
apparent
in
his
conversation
<EOS>
a
certain
feeling
on
his
part
that
he
hardly
thought
it
worth
his
while
to
be
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
It
was
almost
as
though
he
were
playing
with
a
child
.
<EOS>
She
knew
well
enough
that
he
was
in
truth
a
sober
,
thoughtful
man
who
,
in
some
matters
and
on
some
occasions
,
could
endure
an
agony
of
earnestness
.
<EOS>
And
yet
to
her
he
was
always
gently
playful
.
<EOS>
Could
she
have
seen
his
brow
once
clouded
,
she
might
have
learnt
to
love
him
.
  
<EOS>
So
things
went
on
at
Plumstead
,
and
on
the
whole
not
unpleasantly
,
till
a
huge
storm
darkened
the
horizon
and
came
down
upon
the
inhabitants
of
the
rectory
with
all
the
fury
of
a
water
-
spout
.
<EOS>
It
was
astonishing
how
in
a
few
minutes
the
whole
face
of
the
heavens
was
changed
.
<EOS>
The
party
broke
up
from
breakfast
in
perfect
harmony
,
but
fierce
passions
had
arisen
before
the
evening
which
did
not
admit
of
their
sitting
at
the
same
board
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
To
explain
this
it
will
be
necessary
to
go
back
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
remembered
that
the
bishop
expressed
to
Mr.
Slope
in
his
dressing
-
room
his
determination
that
Mr.
Quiverful
should
be
confirmed
in
his
appointment
to
the
hospital
,
and
that
his
lordship
requested
Mr.
Slope
to
communicate
this
decision
to
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
It
will
also
be
remembered
that
the
archdeacon
had
indignantly
declined
seeing
Mr.
Slope
,
and
had
instead
written
a
strong
letter
to
the
bishop
in
which
he
all
but
demanded
the
situation
of
warden
for
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
To
this
letter
the
archdeacon
received
an
immediate
formal
reply
from
Mr.
Slope
,
in
which
it
was
stated
that
the
bishop
had
received
and
would
give
his
best
consideration
to
the
archdeacon
's
letter
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
felt
himself
somewhat
checkmated
by
this
reply
.
<EOS>
What
could
he
do
with
a
man
who
would
neither
see
him
,
nor
argue
with
him
by
letter
,
and
who
had
undoubtedly
the
power
of
appointing
any
clergyman
he
pleased
?
<EOS>
He
had
consulted
with
Mr.
Arabin
,
who
had
suggested
the
propriety
of
calling
in
the
aid
of
the
Master
of
Lazarus
.
<EOS>
"
If
,
"
said
he
,
"
you
and
Dr.
Gwynne
formally
declare
your
intention
of
waiting
upon
the
bishop
,
the
bishop
will
not
dare
to
refuse
to
see
you
;
and
if
two
such
men
as
you
are
see
him
together
,
you
will
probably
not
leave
him
without
carrying
your
point
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
did
not
quite
like
admitting
the
necessity
of
his
being
backed
by
the
Master
of
Lazarus
before
he
could
obtain
admission
into
the
episcopal
palace
of
Barchester
,
but
still
he
felt
that
the
advice
was
good
,
and
he
resolved
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
He
wrote
again
to
the
bishop
,
expressing
a
hope
that
nothing
further
would
be
done
in
the
matter
of
the
hospital
till
the
consideration
promised
by
his
lordship
had
been
given
,
and
then
sent
off
a
warm
appeal
to
his
friend
the
master
,
imploring
him
to
come
to
Plumstead
and
assist
in
driving
the
bishop
into
compliance
.
<EOS>
The
master
had
rejoined
,
raising
some
difficulty
,
but
not
declining
,
and
the
archdeacon
had
again
pressed
his
point
,
insisting
on
the
necessity
for
immediate
action
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
unfortunately
had
the
gout
,
and
could
therefore
name
no
immediate
day
,
but
still
agreed
to
come
,
if
it
should
be
finally
found
necessary
.
<EOS>
So
the
matter
stood
,
as
regarded
the
party
at
Plumstead
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Harding
had
another
friend
fighting
his
battle
for
him
,
quite
as
powerful
as
the
Master
of
Lazarus
,
and
this
was
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Though
the
bishop
had
so
pertinaciously
insisted
on
giving
way
to
his
wife
in
the
matter
of
the
hospital
,
Mr.
Slope
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
abandon
his
object
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
he
thought
,
daily
more
and
more
reason
to
imagine
that
the
widow
would
receive
his
overtures
favourably
,
and
he
could
not
but
feel
that
Mr.
Harding
at
the
hospital
,
and
placed
there
by
his
means
,
would
be
more
likely
to
receive
him
as
a
son
-
in
-
law
than
Mr.
Harding
growling
in
opposition
and
disappointment
under
the
archdeacon
's
wing
at
Plumstead
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
to
give
Mr.
Slope
due
credit
,
he
was
actuated
by
greater
motives
even
than
these
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
a
wife
,
and
he
wanted
money
,
but
he
wanted
power
more
than
either
.
<EOS>
He
had
fully
realized
the
fact
that
he
must
come
to
blows
with
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
desire
to
remain
in
Barchester
as
her
chaplain
.
<EOS>
Sooner
than
do
so
,
he
would
risk
the
loss
of
his
whole
connexion
with
the
diocese
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
Was
he
to
feel
within
him
<EOS>
the
possession
of
no
ordinary
talents
 
was
he
to
know
himself
to
be
courageous
,
firm
,
and
,
in
matters
where
his
conscience
did
not
interfere
,
unscrupulous
 
<EOS>
and
yet
he
contented
to
be
the
working
factotum
of
a
woman
prelate
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
higher
ideas
of
his
own
destiny
.
<EOS>
Either
he
or
Mrs.
Proudie
must
go
to
the
wall
,
and
now
had
come
the
time
when
he
would
try
which
it
should
be
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
had
declared
that
Mr.
Quiverful
should
be
the
new
warden
.
<EOS>
As
Mr.
Slope
went
downstairs
,
prepared
to
see
the
archdeacon
,
if
necessary
,
but
fully
satisfied
that
no
such
necessity
would
arise
,
he
declared
to
himself
that
Mr.
Harding
should
be
warden
.
<EOS>
With
the
object
of
carrying
this
point
,
he
rode
over
to
Puddingdale
and
had
a
further
interview
with
the
worthy
expectant
of
clerical
good
things
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
was
on
the
whole
a
worthy
man
.
<EOS>
The
impossible
task
of
bringing
up
as
ladies
and
gentlemen
fourteen
children
on
an
income
which
was
insufficient
to
give
them
with
decency
the
common
necessaries
of
life
,
had
had
an
effect
upon
him
not
beneficial
either
to
his
spirit
or
his
keen
sense
of
honour
.
<EOS>
Who
can
boast
that
he
would
have
supported
such
a
burden
with
a
different
result
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
was
an
honest
,
painstaking
,
drudging
man
,
anxious
indeed
for
bread
and
meat
,
anxious
for
means
to
quiet
his
butcher
and
cover
with
returning
smiles
the
now
sour
countenance
of
the
baker
's
wife
;
but
anxious
also
to
be
right
with
his
own
conscience
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
careful
,
as
another
might
be
who
sat
on
an
easier
worldly
seat
,
to
stand
well
with
those
around
him
,
to
shun
a
breath
which
might
sully
his
name
or
a
rumour
which
might
affect
his
honour
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
afford
such
niceties
of
conduct
,
such
moral
luxuries
.
<EOS>
It
must
suffice
for
him
to
be
ordinarily
honest
according
to
the
ordinary
honesty
of
the
world
's
ways
,
and
to
let
men
's
tongues
wag
as
they
would
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
felt
that
his
brother
clergymen
,
men
whom
he
had
known
for
the
last
twenty
years
,
looked
coldly
on
him
from
the
first
moment
that
he
had
shown
himself
willing
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
Mr.
Slope
;
he
had
seen
that
their
looks
grew
colder
still
when
it
became
bruited
about
that
he
was
to
be
the
bishop
's
new
warden
at
Hiram
's
Hospital
.
<EOS>
This
was
painful
enough
,
but
it
was
the
cross
which
he
was
doomed
to
bear
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
his
wife
,
whose
last
new
silk
dress
was
six
years
in
wear
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
all
his
young
flock
,
whom
he
could
hardly
take
to
church
with
him
on
Sundays
,
for
there
were
not
decent
shoes
and
stockings
for
them
all
to
wear
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
the
well
-
worn
sleeves
of
his
own
black
coat
and
of
the
stern
face
of
the
draper
,
from
whom
he
would
fain
ask
for
cloth
to
make
another
,
did
he
not
know
that
the
credit
would
be
refused
him
.
<EOS>
Then
he
thought
of
the
comfortable
house
in
Barchester
,
of
the
comfortable
income
,
of
his
boys
sent
to
school
,
of
his
girls
with
books
in
their
hands
instead
of
darning
needles
,
of
his
wife
's
face
again
covered
with
smiles
,
and
of
his
daily
board
again
covered
with
plenty
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
these
things
;
and
do
thou
also
,
reader
,
think
of
them
,
and
then
wonder
,
if
thou
canst
,
that
Mr.
Slope
had
appeared
to
him
to
possess
all
those
good
gifts
which
could
grace
a
bishop
's
chaplain
.
<EOS>
"
How
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
are
the
feet
of
him
that
bringeth
good
tidings
.
"
  
<EOS>
Why
,
moreover
,
should
the
Barchester
clergy
have
looked
coldly
on
Mr.
Quiverful
?
<EOS>
Had
they
not
all
shown
that
they
regarded
with
complacency
the
loaves
and
fishes
of
their
mother
church
?
<EOS>
Had
they
not
all
,
by
some
hook
or
crook
,
done
better
for
themselves
than
he
had
done
?
<EOS>
They
were
not
burdened
as
he
was
burdened
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
had
five
children
and
nearly
as
many
thousands
a
year
on
which
to
feed
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
well
for
him
to
turn
up
his
nose
at
a
new
bishop
who
could
do
nothing
for
him
,
and
a
chaplain
who
was
beneath
his
notice
;
but
it
was
cruel
in
a
man
so
circumstanced
to
set
the
world
against
the
father
of
fourteen
children
because
he
was
anxious
to
obtain
for
them
an
honourable
support
!
<EOS>
He
,
Mr.
Quiverful
,
had
not
asked
for
the
wardenship
;
he
had
not
even
accepted
it
till
he
had
been
assured
that
Mr.
Harding
had
refused
it
.
<EOS>
How
hard
then
that
he
should
be
blamed
for
doing
that
which
not
to
have
done
would
have
argued
a
most
insane
imprudence
!
  
<EOS>
Thus
in
this
matter
of
the
hospital
poor
Mr.
Quiverful
had
his
trials
,
and
he
had
also
his
consolations
.
<EOS>
On
the
whole
the
consolations
were
the
more
vivid
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
The
stern
draper
heard
of
the
coming
promotion
,
and
the
wealth
of
his
warehouse
was
at
Mr.
Quiverful
's
disposal
.
<EOS>
Coming
events
cast
their
shadows
before
,
and
the
coming
event
of
Mr.
Quiverful
's
transference
to
Barchester
produced
a
delicious
shadow
in
the
shape
of
a
new
outfit
for
Mrs.
Quiverful
and
her
three
elder
daughters
.
<EOS>
Such
consolations
come
home
to
the
heart
of
a
man
,
and
quite
home
to
the
heart
of
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Whatever
the
husband
might
feel
,
the
wife
cared
nothing
for
frowns
of
dean
,
archdeacon
,
or
prebendary
.
<EOS>
To
her
the
outsides
and
insides
of
her
husband
and
fourteen
children
were
everything
.
<EOS>
In
her
bosom
every
other
ambition
had
been
swallowed
up
in
that
maternal
ambition
of
seeing
them
and
him
and
herself
duly
clad
and
properly
fed
.
<EOS>
It
had
come
to
that
with
her
that
life
had
now
no
other
purpose
.
<EOS>
She
recked
nothing
of
the
imaginary
rights
of
others
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
patience
with
her
husband
when
he
declared
to
her
that
he
could
not
accept
the
hospital
unless
he
knew
that
Mr.
Harding
had
refused
it
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
had
no
right
to
be
quixotic
at
the
expense
of
fourteen
children
.
<EOS>
The
narrow
escape
of
throwing
away
his
good
fortune
which
her
lord
had
had
,
almost
paralysed
her
.
<EOS>
Now
,
indeed
,
they
had
received
a
full
promise
,
not
only
from
Mr.
Slope
,
but
also
from
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
Now
,
indeed
,
they
might
reckon
with
safety
on
their
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
But
what
if
all
had
been
lost
?
<EOS>
What
if
her
fourteen
bairns
had
been
resteeped
to
the
hips
in
poverty
by
the
morbid
sentimentality
of
their
father
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
was
just
at
present
a
happy
woman
,
but
yet
it
nearly
took
her
breath
away
when
she
thought
of
the
risk
they
had
run
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
your
father
means
when
he
talks
so
much
of
what
is
due
to
Mr.
Harding
,
"
she
said
to
her
eldest
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Does
he
think
that
Mr.
Harding
would
give
him
£
450
a
year
out
of
fine
feeling
?
<EOS>
And
what
signifies
it
whom
he
offends
,
as
long
as
he
gets
the
place
?
<EOS>
He
does
not
expect
anything
better
.
<EOS>
It
passes
me
to
think
how
your
father
can
be
so
soft
,
while
everybody
around
him
is
so
griping
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thus
,
while
the
outer
world
was
accusing
Mr.
Quiverful
of
rapacity
for
promotion
and
of
disregard
to
his
honour
,
the
inner
world
of
his
own
household
was
falling
foul
of
him
,
with
equal
vehemence
,
for
his
willingness
to
sacrifice
their
interests
to
a
false
feeling
of
sentimental
pride
.
<EOS>
It
is
astonishing
how
much
difference
the
point
of
view
makes
in
the
aspect
of
all
that
we
look
at
!
  
<EOS>
Such
were
the
feelings
of
the
different
members
of
the
family
at
Puddingdale
on
the
occasion
of
Mr.
Slope
's
second
visit
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
as
soon
as
she
saw
his
horse
coming
up
the
avenue
from
the
vicarage
gate
,
hastily
packed
up
her
huge
basket
of
needlework
and
hurried
herself
and
her
daughter
out
of
the
room
in
which
she
was
sitting
with
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
Mr.
Slope
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
come
to
settle
with
you
about
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
I
do
hope
we
shall
now
be
able
to
move
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
she
hastened
to
bid
the
maid
of
all
work
go
to
the
door
,
so
that
the
welcome
great
man
might
not
be
kept
waiting
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
thus
found
Mr.
Quiverful
alone
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
went
off
to
her
kitchen
and
back
settlements
with
anxious
beating
heart
,
almost
dreading
that
there
might
be
some
slip
between
the
cup
of
her
happiness
and
the
lip
of
her
fruition
,
but
yet
comforting
herself
with
the
reflexion
that
after
what
had
taken
place
,
any
such
slip
could
hardly
be
possible
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
was
all
smiles
as
he
shook
his
brother
clergyman
's
hand
and
said
that
he
had
ridden
over
because
he
thought
it
right
at
once
to
put
Mr.
Quiverful
in
possession
of
the
facts
of
the
matter
regarding
the
wardenship
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
the
poor
expectant
husband
and
father
saw
at
a
glance
that
his
brilliant
hopes
were
to
be
dashed
to
the
ground
,
and
that
his
visitor
was
now
there
for
the
purpose
of
unsaying
what
on
his
former
visit
he
had
said
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
the
tone
of
the
voice
,
something
in
the
glance
of
the
eye
,
which
told
the
tale
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
knew
it
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
He
maintained
his
self
-
possession
,
however
,
smiled
with
a
slight
unmeaning
smile
,
and
merely
said
that
he
was
obliged
to
Mr.
Slope
for
the
trouble
he
was
taking
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
a
troublesome
matter
from
first
to
last
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
"
and
the
bishop
has
hardly
known
how
to
act
.
<EOS>
Between
ourselves
 
<EOS>
but
mind
this
of
course
must
go
no
further
,
Mr.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
said
that
of
course
it
should
not
.
"
<EOS>
The
truth
is
that
poor
Mr.
Harding
has
hardly
known
his
own
mind
.
<EOS>
You
remember
our
last
conversation
,
no
doubt
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
assured
him
that
he
remembered
it
very
well
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
remember
that
I
told
you
that
Mr.
Harding
had
refused
to
return
to
the
hospital
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
declared
that
nothing
could
be
more
distinct
on
his
memory
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
acting
on
this
refusal
,
I
suggested
that
you
should
take
the
hospital
,
"
continued
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
understood
you
to
say
that
the
bishop
had
authorised
you
to
offer
it
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
?
<EOS>
Did
I
go
so
far
as
that
?
<EOS>
Well
,
perhaps
it
may
be
that
in
my
anxiety
in
your
behalf
I
did
commit
myself
further
than
I
should
have
done
.
<EOS>
So
far
as
my
own
memory
serves
me
,
I
do
n't
think
I
did
go
quite
so
far
as
that
.
<EOS>
But
I
own
I
was
very
anxious
that
you
should
get
it
,
and
<EOS>
I
may
have
said
more
than
was
quite
prudent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
said
Mr.
Quiverful
in
his
deep
anxiety
to
prove
his
case
,
"
my
wife
received
as
distinct
a
promise
from
Mrs.
Proudie
as
one
human
being
could
give
to
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
smiled
and
gently
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
meant
the
smile
for
a
pleasant
smile
,
but
it
was
diabolical
in
the
eyes
of
the
man
he
was
speaking
to
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
If
we
are
to
go
to
what
passes
between
the
ladies
in
these
matters
,
we
shall
really
be
in
a
nest
of
troubles
from
which
we
shall
never
extricate
ourselves
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
is
a
most
excellent
lady
,
kind
-
hearted
,
charitable
,
pious
,
and
in
every
way
estimable
.
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
Mr.
Quiverful
,
the
patronage
of
the
diocese
is
not
in
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
for
a
moment
sat
panic
-
stricken
and
silent
.
"
<EOS>
Am
I
to
understand
,
then
,
that
I
have
received
no
promise
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
as
soon
as
he
had
sufficiently
collected
his
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
allow
me
,
I
will
tell
you
exactly
how
the
matter
rests
.
<EOS>
You
certainly
did
receive
a
promise
conditional
on
Mr.
Harding
's
refusal
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
will
do
me
the
justice
to
remember
that
you
yourself
declared
that
you
could
accept
the
appointment
on
no
other
condition
than
the
knowledge
that
Mr.
Harding
had
declined
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr.
Quiverful
;
"
I
did
say
that
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
now
appears
that
he
did
not
refuse
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
surely
you
told
me
,
and
repeated
it
more
than
once
,
that
he
had
done
so
in
your
own
hearing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
understood
him
.
<EOS>
But
it
seems
I
was
in
error
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
for
a
moment
,
Mr.
Quiverful
,
suppose
that
I
mean
to
throw
you
over
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Having
held
out
my
hand
to
a
man
in
your
position
,
with
your
large
family
and
pressing
claims
,
I
am
not
now
going
to
draw
it
back
again
.
<EOS>
I
only
want
you
to
act
with
me
fairly
and
honestly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whatever
I
do
I
shall
endeavour
at
any
rate
to
act
fairly
,
"
said
the
poor
man
,
feeling
that
he
had
to
fall
back
for
support
on
the
spirit
of
martyrdom
within
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
will
,
"
said
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
have
no
wish
to
obtain
possession
of
an
income
which
belongs
by
all
right
to
another
.
<EOS>
No
man
knows
better
than
you
do
Mr.
Harding
's
history
,
or
can
better
appreciate
his
character
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
is
very
desirous
of
returning
to
his
old
position
,
and
the
bishop
feels
that
he
is
at
the
present
moment
somewhat
hampered
,
though
of
course
he
is
not
bound
,
by
the
conversation
which
took
place
on
the
matter
between
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr.
Quiverful
,
dreadfully
doubtful
as
to
what
his
conduct
under
such
circumstances
should
be
,
and
fruitlessly
striving
to
harden
his
nerves
with
some
of
that
instinct
of
self
-
preservation
which
made
his
wife
so
bold
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
wardenship
of
this
little
hospital
is
not
the
only
thing
in
the
bishop
's
gift
,
Mr.
Quiverful
,
nor
is
it
by
many
degrees
the
best
.
<EOS>
And
his
lordship
is
not
the
man
to
forget
anyone
whom
he
has
once
marked
with
approval
.
<EOS>
If
you
would
allow
me
to
advise
you
as
a
friend
 
"
  
"
Indeed
,
I
shall
be
most
grateful
to
you
,
"
said
the
poor
vicar
of
Puddingdale
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
advise
you
to
withdraw
from
any
opposition
to
Mr.
Harding
's
claims
.
<EOS>
If
you
persist
in
your
demand
,
I
do
not
think
you
will
ultimately
succeed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
has
all
but
a
positive
right
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
will
allow
me
to
inform
the
bishop
that
you
decline
to
stand
in
Mr.
Harding
's
way
,
I
think
I
may
promise
you
 
though
,
by
the
by
,
it
must
not
be
taken
as
a
formal
promise
 
that
the
bishop
will
not
allow
you
to
be
a
poorer
man
than
you
would
have
been
had
you
become
warden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
sat
in
his
armchair
,
silent
,
gazing
at
vacancy
.
<EOS>
What
was
he
to
say
?
<EOS>
All
this
that
came
from
Mr.
Slope
was
so
true
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
had
a
right
to
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
had
a
great
many
good
things
to
give
away
.
<EOS>
Both
the
bishop
and
Mr.
Slope
would
be
excellent
friends
and
terrible
enemies
to
a
man
in
his
position
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
had
no
proof
of
any
promise
;
he
could
not
force
the
bishop
to
appoint
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr.
Quiverful
,
what
do
you
say
about
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
of
course
,
whatever
you
think
fit
,
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
great
disappointment
,
a
very
great
disappointment
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
deny
that
I
am
a
very
poor
man
,
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
end
,
Mr.
Quiverful
,
you
will
find
that
it
will
have
been
better
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
interview
ended
in
Mr.
Slope
receiving
a
full
renunciation
from
Mr.
Quiverful
of
any
claim
he
might
have
to
the
appointment
in
question
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
given
verbally
and
without
witnesses
,
but
then
the
original
promise
was
made
in
the
same
way
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
again
assured
him
that
he
should
not
be
forgotten
,
and
then
rode
back
to
Barchester
,
satisfied
that
he
would
now
be
able
to
mould
the
bishop
to
his
wishes
.
   
<EOS>
Fourteen
Arguments
in
Favour
of
Mr.
Quiverful
's
Claims
 
<EOS>
We
have
most
of
us
heard
of
the
terrible
anger
of
a
lioness
<EOS>
when
,
surrounded
by
her
cubs
,
she
guards
her
prey
.
<EOS>
Few
of
us
wish
to
disturb
the
mother
of
a
litter
of
puppies
when
mouthing
a
bone
in
the
midst
of
her
young
family
.
<EOS>
Medea
and
her
children
are
familiar
to
us
,
and
so
is
the
grief
of
Constance
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
when
she
first
heard
from
her
husband
the
news
which
he
had
to
impart
,
felt
within
her
bosom
all
the
rage
of
the
lioness
,
the
rapacity
of
the
hound
,
the
fury
of
the
tragic
queen
,
and
the
deep
despair
of
the
bereaved
mother
.
  
<EOS>
Doubting
,
but
yet
hardly
fearing
,
what
might
have
been
the
tenor
of
Mr.
Slope
's
discourse
,
she
rushed
back
to
her
husband
as
soon
as
the
front
door
was
closed
behind
the
visitor
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
for
Mr.
Slope
that
he
so
escaped
 
the
anger
of
such
a
woman
,
at
such
a
moment
,
would
have
cowed
even
him
.
<EOS>
As
a
general
rule
,
it
is
highly
desirable
that
ladies
should
keep
their
temper
:
a
woman
when
she
storms
always
makes
herself
ugly
,
and
usually
ridiculous
also
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
so
odious
to
man
as
a
virago
.
<EOS>
Though
Theseus
loved
an
Amazon
,
he
showed
his
love
but
roughly
,
and
from
the
time
of
Theseus
downward
,
no
man
ever
wished
to
have
his
wife
remarkable
rather
for
forward
prowess
than
retiring
gentleness
.
<EOS>
A
low
voice
"
is
an
excellent
thing
in
woman
.
"
  
<EOS>
Such
may
be
laid
down
as
a
very
general
rule
;
and
few
women
should
allow
themselves
to
deviate
from
it
,
and
then
only
on
rare
occasions
.
<EOS>
But
if
there
be
a
time
when
a
woman
may
let
her
hair
to
the
winds
,
when
she
may
loose
her
arms
,
and
scream
out
trumpet
-
tongued
to
the
ears
of
men
,
it
is
when
nature
calls
out
within
her
not
for
her
own
wants
,
but
for
the
wants
of
those
whom
her
womb
has
borne
,
whom
her
breasts
have
suckled
,
for
those
who
look
to
her
for
their
daily
bread
as
naturally
as
man
looks
to
his
Creator
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
poetic
in
the
nature
of
Mrs.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
She
was
neither
a
Medea
nor
a
Constance
.
<EOS>
When
angry
,
she
spoke
out
her
anger
in
plain
words
,
and
in
a
tone
which
might
have
been
modulated
with
advantage
;
but
she
did
so
,
at
any
rate
,
without
affectation
.
<EOS>
Now
,
without
knowing
it
,
she
rose
to
a
tragic
vein
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
we
are
not
to
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
were
the
words
with
which
her
ears
were
greeted
when
she
entered
the
parlour
,
still
hot
from
the
kitchen
fire
.
<EOS>
And
the
face
of
her
husband
spoke
even
more
plainly
than
his
words
:
    
E'en
<EOS>
such
a
man
,
so
faint
,
<EOS>
so
spiritless
,
<EOS>
So
dull
,
so
dead
in
look
,
so
woe
-
begone
,
<EOS>
Drew
Priam
's
curtain
in
the
dead
of
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
she
 
and
Mrs.
Siddons
could
not
have
put
more
passion
into
a
single
syllable
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
Not
have
it
?
<EOS>
Who
says
so
?
"
<EOS>
And
she
sat
opposite
to
her
husband
,
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
,
her
hands
clasped
together
,
and
her
coarse
,
solid
,
but
once
handsome
face
stretched
over
it
towards
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
sat
as
silent
as
death
while
he
told
his
story
,
and
very
dreadful
to
him
<EOS>
her
silence
was
.
<EOS>
He
told
it
very
lamely
and
badly
but
still
in
such
a
manner
that
she
soon
understood
the
whole
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
have
resigned
it
?
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
no
opportunity
of
accepting
it
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
no
witnesses
to
Mr.
Slope
's
offer
,
even
if
that
offer
would
bind
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
It
was
better
for
me
,
on
the
whole
,
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
such
men
than
to
fight
for
what
I
should
never
get
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Witnesses
!
<EOS>
"
she
screamed
,
rising
quickly
to
her
feet
and
walking
up
and
down
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
Do
clergymen
require
witnesses
to
their
words
?
<EOS>
He
made
the
promise
in
the
bishop
's
name
,
and
if
it
is
to
be
broken
,
I
'll
know
the
reason
why
.
<EOS>
Did
he
not
positively
say
that
the
bishop
had
sent
him
to
offer
you
the
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
But
that
is
now
nothing
to
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
everything
to
the
purpose
,
Mr.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
Witnesses
indeed
!
<EOS>
And
then
to
talk
of
your
honour
being
questioned
because
you
wish
to
provide
for
fourteen
children
.
<EOS>
It
is
everything
to
the
purpose
;
and
so
they
shall
know
,
if
I
scream
it
into
their
ears
from
the
town
cross
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
forget
,
Letitia
,
that
the
bishop
has
so
many
things
in
his
gift
.
<EOS>
We
must
wait
a
little
longer
.
<EOS>
That
is
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wait
!
<EOS>
Shall
we
feed
the
children
by
waiting
?
<EOS>
Will
waiting
put
George
,
and
Tom
,
and
Sam
out
into
the
world
?
<EOS>
Will
it
enable
my
poor
girls
to
give
up
some
of
their
drudgery
?
<EOS>
Will
waiting
make
Bessy
and
Jane
fit
even
to
be
governesses
?
<EOS>
Will
waiting
pay
for
the
things
we
got
in
Barchester
last
week
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
we
can
do
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
The
disappointment
is
as
much
to
me
as
to
you
;
and
yet
,
God
knows
,
I
feel
it
more
for
your
sake
than
my
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
was
looking
full
into
her
husband
's
face
,
and
saw
a
small
hot
tear
appear
on
each
of
those
furrowed
cheeks
.
<EOS>
This
was
too
much
for
her
woman
's
heart
.
<EOS>
He
also
had
risen
,
and
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
empty
grate
.
<EOS>
She
rushed
towards
him
and
,
seizing
him
in
her
arms
,
sobbed
aloud
upon
his
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
too
good
,
too
soft
,
too
yielding
,
"
she
said
at
last
.
"
<EOS>
These
men
,
when
they
want
you
,
they
use
you
like
a
cat
's
paw
;
and
when
they
want
you
no
longer
,
they
throw
you
aside
like
an
old
shoe
.
<EOS>
This
is
twice
they
have
treated
you
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
one
way
this
will
be
all
for
the
better
,
"
argued
he
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
make
the
bishop
feel
that
he
is
bound
to
do
something
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
he
shall
hear
of
it
,
"
said
the
lady
,
again
reverting
to
her
more
angry
mood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
any
rate
he
shall
hear
of
it
,
and
that
loudly
;
and
so
shall
she
.
<EOS>
She
little
knows
Letitia
Quiverful
,
if
she
thinks
I
will
sit
down
quietly
with
the
loss
after
all
that
passed
between
us
at
the
palace
.
<EOS>
If
there
's
any
feeling
within
her
,
I
'll
make
her
ashamed
of
herself
,
"
 
and
she
paced
the
room
again
,
stamping
the
floor
as
she
went
with
her
fat
,
heavy
foot
.
"
<EOS>
Good
heavens
!
<EOS>
What
a
heart
she
must
have
within
her
to
treat
in
such
a
way
as
this
the
father
of
fourteen
unprovided
children
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
proceeded
to
explain
that
he
did
n't
think
that
Mrs.
Proudie
had
had
anything
to
do
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
tell
me
,
"
said
Mrs.
Quiverful
;
"
I
know
more
about
it
than
that
.
<EOS>
Does
n't
all
the
world
know
that
Mrs.
Proudie
is
bishop
of
Barchester
and
that
Mr.
Slope
is
merely
her
creature
?
<EOS>
Was
n't
it
she
that
made
me
the
promise
,
just
as
though
the
thing
was
in
her
own
particular
gift
?
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
it
was
that
woman
who
sent
him
over
here
to
-
day
,
because
,
for
some
reason
of
her
own
,
she
wants
to
go
back
from
her
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
you
're
wrong
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Now
,
Q.
,
do
n't
be
so
soft
,
"
she
continued
.
<EOS>
"
Take
my
word
for
it
,
the
bishop
knows
no
more
about
it
than
Jemima
does
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Jemima
was
the
two
-
year
-
old
.
"
<EOS>
And
if
you
'll
take
my
advice
,
you
'll
lose
no
time
in
going
over
and
seeing
him
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Soft
,
however
,
as
Mr.
Quiverful
might
be
,
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
talked
out
of
his
opinion
on
this
occasion
,
and
proceeded
with
much
minuteness
to
explain
to
his
wife
the
tone
in
which
Mr.
Slope
had
spoken
of
Mrs.
Proudie
's
interference
in
diocesan
matters
.
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
,
a
new
idea
gradually
instilled
itself
into
the
matron
's
head
,
and
a
new
course
of
conduct
presented
itself
to
her
judgement
.
<EOS>
What
if
,
after
all
,
Mrs.
Proudie
knew
nothing
of
this
visit
of
Mr.
Slope
's
?
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
might
it
not
be
possible
that
that
lady
would
still
be
staunch
to
her
in
this
matter
,
still
stand
her
friend
,
and
,
perhaps
,
possibly
carry
her
through
in
opposition
to
Mr.
Slope
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
said
nothing
as
this
vague
hope
occurred
to
her
,
but
listened
with
more
than
ordinary
patience
to
what
her
husband
had
to
say
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
still
explaining
that
in
all
probability
the
world
was
wrong
in
its
estimation
of
Mrs.
Proudie
's
power
and
authority
,
she
had
fully
made
up
her
mind
as
to
her
course
of
action
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
,
however
,
proclaim
her
intention
.
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
ominously
as
he
continued
his
narration
,
and
when
he
had
completed
,
she
rose
to
go
,
merely
observing
that
it
was
cruel
,
cruel
treatment
.
<EOS>
She
then
asked
him
if
he
would
mind
waiting
for
a
late
dinner
instead
of
dining
at
their
usual
hour
of
three
;
and
,
having
received
from
him
a
concession
on
this
point
,
she
proceeded
to
carry
her
purpose
into
execution
.
  
<EOS>
She
determined
that
she
would
at
once
go
to
the
palace
,
that
she
would
do
so
,
if
possible
,
before
Mrs.
Proudie
could
have
had
an
interview
with
Mr.
Slope
,
and
that
she
would
be
either
submissive
,
piteous
,
and
pathetic
,
or
else
indignant
,
violent
,
and
exacting
,
according
to
the
manner
in
which
she
was
received
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
quite
confident
in
her
own
power
.
<EOS>
Strengthened
as
she
was
by
the
pressing
wants
of
fourteen
children
,
she
felt
that
she
could
make
her
way
through
legions
of
episcopal
servants
and
force
herself
,
if
need
be
,
into
the
presence
of
the
lady
who
had
so
wronged
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
shame
about
it
,
no
_
mauvaise
honte
_
,
no
dread
of
archdeacons
.
<EOS>
She
would
,
as
she
declared
to
her
husband
,
make
her
wail
heard
in
the
market
-
place
if
she
did
not
get
redress
and
justice
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
very
well
for
an
unmarried
young
curate
to
be
shamefaced
in
such
matters
;
it
might
be
all
right
that
a
snug
rector
,
really
in
want
of
nothing
,
but
still
looking
for
better
preferment
,
should
carry
on
his
affairs
decently
under
the
rose
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
with
fourteen
children
,
had
given
over
being
shamefaced
and
,
in
some
things
,
had
given
over
being
decent
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
intended
that
she
should
be
ill
-
used
in
the
manner
proposed
by
Mr.
Slope
,
it
should
not
be
done
under
the
rose
.
<EOS>
All
the
world
should
know
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
In
her
present
mood
,
Mrs.
Quiverful
was
not
over
-
careful
about
her
attire
.
<EOS>
She
tied
her
bonnet
under
her
chin
,
threw
her
shawl
over
her
shoulders
,
armed
herself
with
the
old
family
cotton
umbrella
,
and
started
for
Barchester
.
<EOS>
A
journey
to
the
palace
was
not
quite
so
easy
a
thing
for
Mrs.
Quiverful
as
for
our
friend
at
Plumstead
.
<EOS>
Plumstead
is
nine
miles
from
Barchester
,
and
Puddingdale
is
but
four
.
<EOS>
But
the
archdeacon
could
order
round
his
brougham
,
and
his
high
-
trotting
fast
bay
gelding
would
take
him
into
the
city
within
the
hour
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
brougham
in
the
coach
-
house
of
Puddingdale
Vicarage
,
no
bay
horse
in
the
stables
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
method
of
locomotion
for
its
inhabitants
but
that
which
nature
has
assigned
to
man
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
was
a
broad
,
heavy
woman
,
not
young
,
nor
given
to
walking
.
<EOS>
In
her
kitchen
,
and
in
the
family
dormitories
,
she
was
active
enough
,
but
her
pace
and
gait
were
not
adapted
for
the
road
.
<EOS>
A
walk
into
Barchester
and
back
in
the
middle
of
an
August
day
would
be
to
her
a
terrible
task
,
if
not
altogether
impracticable
.
<EOS>
There
was
living
in
the
parish
,
about
half
a
mile
from
the
vicarage
on
the
road
to
the
city
,
a
decent
,
kindly
farmer
,
well
to
do
as
regards
this
world
and
so
far
mindful
of
the
next
that
he
attended
his
parish
church
with
decent
regularity
.
<EOS>
To
him
Mrs.
Quiverful
had
before
now
appealed
in
some
of
her
more
pressing
family
troubles
,
and
had
not
appealed
in
vain
.
<EOS>
At
his
door
she
now
presented
herself
,
and
,
having
explained
to
his
wife
that
most
urgent
business
required
her
to
go
at
once
to
Barchester
,
begged
that
Farmer
Subsoil
would
take
her
thither
in
his
tax
-
cart
.
<EOS>
The
farmer
did
not
reject
her
plan
,
and
,
as
soon
as
Prince
could
be
got
into
his
collar
,
they
started
on
their
journey
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
did
not
mention
the
purpose
of
her
business
,
nor
did
the
farmer
alloy
his
kindness
by
any
unseemly
questions
.
<EOS>
She
merely
begged
to
be
put
down
at
the
bridge
going
into
the
city
and
to
be
taken
up
again
at
the
same
place
in
the
course
of
two
hours
.
<EOS>
The
farmer
promised
to
be
punctual
to
his
appointment
,
and
the
lady
,
supported
by
her
umbrella
,
took
the
short
cut
to
the
close
and
,
in
a
few
minutes
,
was
at
the
bishop
's
door
.
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
she
had
felt
no
dread
with
regard
to
the
coming
interview
.
<EOS>
She
had
felt
nothing
but
an
indignant
longing
to
pour
forth
her
claims
,
and
declare
her
wrongs
,
if
those
claims
were
not
fully
admitted
.
<EOS>
But
now
the
difficulty
of
her
situation
touched
her
a
little
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
at
the
palace
once
before
,
but
then
she
went
to
give
grateful
thanks
.
<EOS>
Those
who
have
thanks
to
return
for
favours
received
find
easy
admittance
to
the
halls
of
the
great
.
<EOS>
Such
is
not
always
the
case
with
men
,
or
even
with
women
,
who
have
favours
to
beg
.
<EOS>
Still
less
easy
is
access
for
those
who
demand
the
fulfilment
of
promises
already
made
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
had
not
been
slow
to
learn
the
ways
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
knew
all
this
,
and
she
knew
also
that
her
cotton
umbrella
and
all
but
ragged
shawl
would
not
command
respect
in
the
eyes
of
the
palatial
servants
.
<EOS>
If
she
were
too
humble
,
she
knew
well
that
she
would
never
succeed
.
<EOS>
To
overcome
by
imperious
overbearing
with
such
a
shawl
as
hers
upon
her
shoulders
and
such
a
bonnet
on
her
head
would
have
required
a
personal
bearing
very
superior
to
that
with
which
nature
had
endowed
her
.
<EOS>
Of
this
also
Mrs.
Quiverful
was
aware
.
<EOS>
She
must
make
it
known
that
she
was
the
wife
of
a
gentleman
and
a
clergyman
,
and
must
yet
condescend
to
conciliate
.
  
<EOS>
The
poor
lady
knew
but
one
way
to
overcome
these
difficulties
at
the
very
threshold
of
her
enterprise
,
and
to
this
she
resorted
.
<EOS>
Low
as
were
the
domestic
funds
at
Puddingdale
,
she
still
retained
possession
of
half
a
crown
,
and
this
she
sacrificed
to
the
avarice
of
Mrs.
Proudie
's
metropolitan
sesquipedalian
serving
-
man
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
she
said
,
Mrs.
Quiverful
of
Puddingdale
,
the
wife
of
the
Rev.
Mr.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
She
wished
to
see
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
It
was
indeed
quite
indispensable
that
she
should
see
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
James
Fitzplush
looked
worse
than
dubious
,
did
not
know
whether
his
lady
were
out
,
or
engaged
,
or
in
her
bedroom
;
thought
it
most
probable
she
was
subject
to
one
of
these
or
to
some
other
cause
that
would
make
her
invisible
;
but
Mrs.
Quiverful
could
sit
down
in
the
waiting
-
room
while
inquiry
was
being
made
of
Mrs.
Proudie
's
maid
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
my
man
,
"
said
Mrs.
Quiverful
;
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
her
;
"
and
she
put
her
card
and
half
-
crown
 
<EOS>
think
of
it
,
<EOS>
my
reader
,
think
of
it
;
her
last
half
-
crown
 
into
the
man
's
hand
and
sat
herself
down
on
a
chair
in
the
waiting
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
the
bribe
carried
the
day
,
or
whether
the
bishop
's
wife
really
chose
to
see
the
vicar
's
wife
,
it
boots
not
now
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
The
man
returned
and
,
begging
Mrs.
Quiverful
to
follow
him
,
ushered
her
into
the
presence
of
the
mistress
of
the
diocese
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
at
once
saw
that
her
patroness
was
in
a
smiling
humour
.
<EOS>
Triumph
sat
throned
upon
her
brow
,
and
all
the
joys
of
dominion
hovered
about
her
curls
.
<EOS>
Her
lord
had
that
morning
contested
with
her
a
great
point
.
<EOS>
He
had
received
an
invitation
to
spend
a
couple
of
days
with
the
archbishop
.
<EOS>
His
soul
longed
for
the
gratification
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
,
however
,
in
his
grace
's
note
alluded
to
the
fact
of
his
being
a
married
man
;
if
he
went
at
all
,
he
must
go
alone
.
<EOS>
This
necessity
would
have
presented
no
insurmountable
bar
to
the
visit
,
or
have
militated
much
against
the
pleasure
,
had
he
been
able
to
go
without
any
reference
to
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
But
this
he
could
not
do
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
order
his
portmanteau
to
be
packed
and
start
with
his
own
man
,
merely
telling
the
lady
of
his
heart
that
he
would
probably
be
back
on
Saturday
.
<EOS>
There
are
men
 
<EOS>
may
we
not
rather
say
monsters
?
 
<EOS>
who
do
such
things
,
and
there
are
wives
 
<EOS>
may
we
not
rather
say
slaves
?
 
<EOS>
who
put
up
with
such
usage
.
<EOS>
But
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Proudie
were
not
among
the
number
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
,
with
some
beating
about
the
bush
,
made
the
lady
understand
that
he
very
much
wished
to
go
.
<EOS>
The
lady
,
without
any
beating
about
the
bush
,
made
the
bishop
understand
that
she
would
n't
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
useless
here
to
repeat
the
arguments
that
were
used
on
each
side
,
and
needless
to
record
the
result
.
<EOS>
Those
who
are
married
will
understand
very
well
how
the
battle
was
lost
and
won
,
and
those
who
are
single
will
never
understand
it
till
they
learn
the
lesson
which
experience
alone
can
give
.
<EOS>
When
Mrs.
Quiverful
was
shown
into
Mrs.
Proudie
's
room
,
that
lady
had
only
returned
a
few
minutes
from
her
lord
.
<EOS>
But
before
she
left
him
she
had
seen
the
answer
to
the
archbishop
's
note
written
and
sealed
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
that
her
face
was
wreathed
with
smiles
as
she
received
Mrs.
Quiverful
.
  
<EOS>
She
instantly
spoke
of
the
subject
which
was
so
near
the
heart
of
her
visitor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
"
said
she
,
"
is
it
decided
yet
when
you
are
to
move
into
Barchester
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
woman
,
"
as
she
had
an
hour
or
two
since
been
called
,
became
instantly
re
-
endowed
with
all
the
graces
that
can
adorn
a
bishop
's
wife
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
immediately
saw
that
her
business
was
to
be
piteous
,
and
that
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
indignation
 
nothing
,
indeed
,
unless
she
could
be
indignant
in
company
with
her
patroness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mrs.
Proudie
<EOS>
,
"
she
began
,
"
I
fear
we
are
not
to
move
to
Barchester
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
said
that
lady
sharply
,
dropping
at
a
moment
's
notice
her
smiles
and
condescension
,
and
turning
with
her
sharp
quick
way
to
business
which
she
saw
at
a
glance
was
important
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
Mrs.
Quiverful
told
her
tale
.
<EOS>
As
she
progressed
in
the
history
of
her
wrongs
she
perceived
that
the
heavier
she
leant
upon
Mr.
Slope
<EOS>
the
blacker
became
Mrs.
Proudie
's
brow
,
but
that
such
blackness
was
not
injurious
to
her
own
case
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Slope
was
at
Puddingdale
Vicarage
that
morning
she
had
regarded
him
as
the
creature
of
the
lady
-
bishop
;
now
she
perceived
that
they
were
enemies
.
<EOS>
She
admitted
her
mistake
to
herself
without
any
pain
or
humiliation
.
<EOS>
She
had
but
one
feeling
,
and
that
was
confined
to
her
family
.
<EOS>
She
cared
little
how
she
twisted
and
turned
among
these
new
-
comers
at
the
bishop
's
palace
so
long
as
she
could
twist
her
husband
into
the
warden
's
house
.
<EOS>
She
cared
not
which
was
her
friend
or
which
was
her
enemy
,
if
only
she
could
get
this
preferment
which
she
so
sorely
wanted
.
  
<EOS>
She
told
her
tale
,
and
Mrs.
Proudie
listened
to
it
almost
in
silence
.
<EOS>
She
told
how
Mr.
Slope
had
cozened
her
husband
into
resigning
his
claim
,
and
had
declared
that
it
was
the
bishop
's
will
<EOS>
that
none
but
Mr.
Harding
should
be
warden
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
's
brow
became
blacker
and
blacker
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
started
from
her
chair
and
,
begging
Mrs.
Quiverful
to
sit
and
wait
for
her
return
,
marched
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mrs.
Proudie
,
it
's
for
fourteen
children
 
for
fourteen
children
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
was
the
burden
that
fell
on
her
ear
as
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
Wrestles
and
Gets
a
Fall
 
<EOS>
It
was
hardly
an
hour
since
Mrs.
Proudie
had
left
her
husband
's
apartment
victorious
,
and
yet
so
indomitable
was
her
courage
that
she
now
returned
thither
panting
for
another
combat
.
<EOS>
She
was
greatly
angry
with
what
she
thought
was
his
duplicity
.
<EOS>
He
had
so
clearly
given
her
a
promise
on
this
matter
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
already
so
absolutely
vanquished
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
began
to
feel
that
if
every
affair
was
to
be
thus
discussed
and
battled
about
twice
and
even
thrice
,
the
work
of
the
diocese
would
be
too
much
even
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
Without
knocking
at
the
door
,
she
walked
quickly
into
her
husband
's
room
and
found
him
seated
at
his
office
table
,
with
Mr.
Slope
opposite
to
him
.
<EOS>
Between
his
fingers
was
the
very
note
which
he
had
written
to
the
archbishop
in
her
presence
 
<EOS>
and
it
was
open
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
he
had
absolutely
violated
the
seal
which
had
been
made
sacred
by
her
approval
.
<EOS>
They
were
sitting
in
deep
conclave
,
and
it
was
too
clear
that
the
purport
of
the
archbishop
's
invitation
had
been
absolutely
canvassed
again
,
after
it
had
been
already
debated
and
decided
on
in
obedience
to
her
behests
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
rose
from
his
chair
and
bowed
slightly
.
<EOS>
The
two
opposing
spirits
looked
each
other
fully
in
the
face
,
and
they
knew
that
they
were
looking
each
at
an
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
,
Bishop
,
about
Mr.
Quiverful
?
"
said
she
,
coming
to
the
end
of
the
table
and
standing
there
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
did
not
allow
the
bishop
to
answer
but
replied
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
out
to
Puddingdale
this
morning
,
ma'am
,
and
have
seen
Mr.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
has
abandoned
his
claim
to
the
hospital
because
he
is
now
aware
that
Mr.
Harding
is
desirous
to
fill
his
old
place
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
I
have
strongly
advised
his
lordship
to
nominate
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Quiverful
has
not
abandoned
anything
,
"
said
the
lady
,
with
a
very
imperious
voice
.
"
<EOS>
His
lordship
's
word
has
been
pledged
to
him
,
and
it
must
be
respected
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
still
remained
silent
.
<EOS>
He
was
anxiously
desirous
of
making
his
old
enemy
bite
the
dust
beneath
his
feet
.
<EOS>
His
new
ally
had
told
him
that
nothing
was
more
easy
for
him
than
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
The
ally
was
there
now
at
his
elbow
to
help
him
,
and
yet
his
courage
failed
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
hard
to
conquer
when
the
prestige
of
former
victories
is
all
against
one
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
hard
for
the
cock
who
has
once
been
beaten
out
of
his
yard
to
resume
his
courage
and
again
take
a
proud
place
upon
a
dunghill
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
ought
not
to
interfere
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
"
but
<EOS>
yet
 
"
  
"
Certainly
you
ought
not
,
"
said
the
infuriated
dame
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
yet
,
"
continued
Mr.
Slope
,
not
regarding
the
interruption
,
"
I
have
thought
it
my
imperative
duty
to
recommend
the
bishop
not
to
slight
Mr.
Harding
's
claims
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Harding
should
have
known
his
own
mind
,
"
said
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
Mr.
Harding
be
not
replaced
at
the
hospital
,
his
lordship
will
have
to
encounter
much
ill
-
will
,
not
only
in
the
diocese
,
but
in
the
world
at
large
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
taking
a
higher
ground
,
his
lordship
,
as
I
understand
,
feels
it
to
be
his
duty
to
gratify
,
in
this
matter
,
so
very
worthy
a
man
<EOS>
and
so
good
a
clergyman
as
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
is
to
become
of
the
Sabbath
-
day
school
and
of
the
Sunday
services
in
the
hospital
?
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
,
with
something
very
nearly
approaching
to
a
sneer
on
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
that
Mr.
Harding
makes
no
objection
to
the
Sabbath
-
day
school
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
as
to
the
hospital
services
,
that
matter
will
be
best
discussed
after
his
appointment
.
<EOS>
If
he
has
any
permanent
objection
,
then
,
I
fear
,
the
matter
must
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
very
easy
conscience
in
such
matters
,
Mr.
Slope
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
an
easy
conscience
,
"
he
rejoined
,
"
but
a
conscience
very
far
from
being
easy
,
if
anything
said
or
done
by
me
should
lead
the
bishop
to
act
unadvisedly
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
It
is
clear
that
in
the
interview
<EOS>
I
had
with
Mr.
Harding
<EOS>
I
misunderstood
him
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
it
is
equally
clear
that
you
have
misunderstood
Mr.
Quiverful
,
"
said
she
,
now
at
the
top
of
her
wrath
.
<EOS>
"
What
business
have
you
at
all
with
these
interviews
?
<EOS>
Who
desired
you
to
go
to
Mr.
Quiverful
this
morning
?
<EOS>
Who
commissioned
you
to
manage
this
affair
?
<EOS>
Will
you
answer
me
,
sir
?
<EOS>
Who
sent
you
to
Mr.
Quiverful
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
dead
pause
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
risen
from
his
chair
,
and
was
standing
with
his
hand
on
the
back
of
it
,
looking
at
first
very
solemn
and
now
very
black
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
was
standing
as
she
had
at
first
placed
herself
,
at
the
end
of
the
table
,
and
as
she
interrogated
her
foe
<EOS>
she
struck
her
hand
upon
it
with
almost
more
than
feminine
vigour
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
was
sitting
in
his
easy
chair
twiddling
his
thumbs
,
turning
his
eyes
now
to
his
wife
,
and
now
to
his
chaplain
,
as
each
took
up
the
cudgels
.
<EOS>
How
comfortable
it
would
be
if
they
could
fight
it
out
between
them
without
the
necessity
of
any
interference
on
his
part
;
fight
it
out
so
that
one
should
kill
the
other
utterly
,
as
far
as
diocesan
life
was
concerned
,
so
that
he
,
the
bishop
,
might
know
clearly
by
whom
it
behoved
him
to
be
led
.
<EOS>
There
would
be
the
comfort
of
quiet
in
either
case
;
but
if
the
bishop
had
a
wish
as
to
which
might
prove
the
victor
,
that
wish
was
certainly
not
antagonistic
to
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
Better
the
d
 
---
you
know
than
the
d
 
---
you
do
n't
know
,
"
is
an
old
saying
,
and
perhaps
a
true
one
;
but
the
bishop
had
not
yet
realized
the
truth
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
answer
me
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
she
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
Who
instructed
you
to
call
on
Mr.
Quiverful
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
There
was
another
pause
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
intend
to
answer
me
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Mrs.
Proudie
,
that
under
all
the
circumstances
it
will
be
better
for
me
not
to
answer
such
a
question
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
many
tones
in
his
voice
,
all
duly
under
his
command
;
among
them
was
a
sanctified
low
tone
and
a
sanctified
loud
tone
 
<EOS>
he
now
used
the
former
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
anyone
send
you
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Proudie
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
"
I
am
quite
aware
how
much
I
owe
to
your
kindness
.
<EOS>
I
am
aware
also
what
is
due
by
courtesy
from
a
gentleman
to
a
lady
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
higher
considerations
than
either
of
those
,
and
I
hope
I
shall
be
forgiven
if
I
now
allow
myself
to
be
actuated
solely
by
them
.
<EOS>
My
duty
in
this
matter
is
to
his
lordship
,
and
I
can
admit
of
no
questioning
but
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
has
approved
of
what
I
have
done
,
and
you
must
excuse
me
if
I
say
that
,
having
that
approval
and
my
own
,
I
want
none
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
horrid
words
were
these
which
greeted
the
ear
of
Mrs.
Proudie
?
<EOS>
The
matter
was
indeed
too
clear
.
<EOS>
There
was
premeditated
mutiny
in
the
camp
.
<EOS>
Not
only
had
ill
-
conditioned
minds
become
insubordinate
by
the
fruition
of
a
little
power
,
but
sedition
had
been
overtly
taught
and
preached
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
had
not
yet
been
twelve
months
in
his
chair
,
and
rebellion
had
already
reared
her
hideous
head
within
the
palace
.
<EOS>
Anarchy
and
misrule
would
quickly
follow
unless
she
took
immediate
and
strong
measures
to
put
down
the
conspiracy
which
she
had
detected
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slope
,
"
she
said
with
slow
and
dignified
voice
,
differing
much
from
that
which
she
had
hitherto
used
,
"
Mr.
Slope
,
I
will
trouble
you
,
if
you
please
,
to
leave
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
speak
to
my
lord
alone
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
also
felt
that
everything
depended
on
the
present
interview
.
<EOS>
Should
the
bishop
now
be
re
-
petticoated
,
his
thraldom
would
be
complete
and
forever
.
<EOS>
The
present
moment
was
peculiarly
propitious
for
rebellion
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
had
clearly
committed
himself
by
breaking
the
seal
of
the
answer
to
the
archbishop
;
he
had
therefore
fear
to
influence
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
told
him
that
no
consideration
ought
to
induce
him
to
refuse
the
archbishop
's
invitation
;
he
had
therefore
hope
to
influence
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
accepted
Mr.
Quiverful
's
resignation
and
therefore
dreaded
having
to
renew
that
matter
with
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
screwed
up
to
the
pitch
of
asserting
a
will
of
his
own
,
and
might
possibly
be
carried
on
till
by
an
absolute
success
he
should
have
been
taught
how
possible
it
was
to
succeed
.
<EOS>
Now
was
the
moment
for
victory
or
rout
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
that
Mr.
Slope
must
make
himself
master
of
the
diocese
,
or
else
resign
his
place
and
begin
his
search
for
fortune
again
.
<EOS>
He
saw
all
this
plainly
.
<EOS>
After
what
had
taken
place
any
compromise
between
him
and
the
lady
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
Let
him
once
leave
the
room
at
her
bidding
and
leave
the
bishop
in
her
hands
,
and
he
might
at
once
pack
up
his
portmanteau
and
bid
adieu
to
episcopal
honours
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
and
the
Signora
Neroni
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
it
was
not
so
easy
to
keep
his
ground
when
he
was
bidden
by
a
lady
to
go
,
or
to
continue
to
make
a
third
in
a
party
between
a
husband
and
wife
when
the
wife
expressed
a
wish
for
a
_
tête
-
à
-
tête
_
with
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slope
,
"
she
repeated
,
"
I
wish
to
be
alone
with
my
lord
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
lordship
has
summoned
me
on
most
important
diocesan
business
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
glancing
with
uneasy
eye
at
Dr.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
he
must
trust
something
to
the
bishop
,
and
yet
that
that
trust
was
so
woefully
ill
-
placed
.
<EOS>
"
My
leaving
him
at
the
present
moment
is
,
I
fear
,
impossible
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
bandy
words
with
me
,
you
ungrateful
man
?
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
lord
,
will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
beg
Mr.
Slope
to
leave
the
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
lord
scratched
his
head
,
but
for
the
moment
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
This
was
as
much
as
Mr.
Slope
expected
from
him
,
and
was
on
the
whole
,
for
him
,
an
active
exercise
of
marital
rights
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
said
the
lady
,
"
is
Mr.
Slope
to
leave
this
room
,
or
am
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Mrs.
Proudie
made
a
false
step
.
<EOS>
She
should
not
have
alluded
to
the
possibility
of
retreat
on
her
part
.
<EOS>
She
should
not
have
expressed
the
idea
that
her
order
for
Mr.
Slope
's
expulsion
could
be
treated
otherwise
than
by
immediate
obedience
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
such
a
question
the
bishop
naturally
said
in
his
own
mind
that
,
as
it
was
necessary
that
one
should
leave
the
room
,
perhaps
it
might
be
as
well
that
Mrs.
Proudie
did
so
.
<EOS>
He
did
say
so
in
his
own
mind
,
but
externally
he
again
scratched
his
head
and
again
twiddled
his
thumbs
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
was
boiling
over
with
wrath
.
<EOS>
Alas
,
alas
!
<EOS>
Could
<EOS>
she
but
have
kept
her
temper
as
her
enemy
did
,
she
would
have
conquered
as
she
had
ever
conquered
.
<EOS>
But
divine
anger
got
the
better
of
her
,
as
it
has
done
of
other
heroines
,
and
she
fell
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
said
she
,
"
am
I
to
be
vouchsafed
an
answer
or
am
I
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
At
last
he
broke
his
deep
silence
and
proclaimed
himself
a
Slopeite
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
,
"
said
he
,
"
Mr.
Slope
and
I
are
very
busy
.
"
  
<EOS>
That
was
all
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
more
necessary
.
<EOS>
He
had
gone
to
the
battlefield
,
stood
the
dust
and
heat
of
the
day
,
encountered
the
fury
of
the
foe
,
and
won
the
victory
.
<EOS>
How
easy
is
success
to
those
who
will
only
be
true
to
themselves
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
saw
at
once
the
full
amount
of
his
gain
,
and
turned
on
the
vanquished
lady
a
look
of
triumph
which
she
never
forgot
and
never
forgave
.
<EOS>
Here
he
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
looked
humbly
at
her
and
,
with
meek
entreating
eye
,
have
deprecated
her
anger
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
said
by
his
glance
that
he
asked
pardon
for
his
success
,
and
that
he
hoped
forgiveness
for
the
stand
which
he
had
been
forced
to
make
in
the
cause
of
duty
.
<EOS>
So
might
he
perchance
have
somewhat
mollified
that
imperious
bosom
and
prepared
the
way
for
future
terms
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Slope
meant
to
rule
without
terms
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
forgetful
,
inexperienced
man
!
<EOS>
Can
you
cause
that
little
trembling
victim
to
be
divorced
from
the
woman
that
possesses
him
?
<EOS>
Can
you
provide
that
they
shall
be
separated
at
bed
and
board
?
<EOS>
Is
he
not
flesh
of
her
flesh
and
bone
of
her
bone
,
and
must
he
not
so
continue
?
<EOS>
It
is
very
well
now
for
you
to
stand
your
ground
and
triumph
as
she
is
driven
ignominiously
from
the
room
,
but
can
you
be
present
when
those
curtains
are
drawn
,
when
that
awful
helmet
of
proof
has
been
tied
beneath
the
chin
,
when
the
small
remnants
of
the
bishop
's
prowess
shall
be
cowed
by
the
tassel
above
his
head
?
<EOS>
Can
you
then
intrude
yourself
when
the
wife
wishes
"
to
speak
to
my
lord
alone
?
"
  
<EOS>
But
for
the
moment
Mr.
Slope
's
triumph
was
complete
,
for
Mrs.
Proudie
without
further
parley
<EOS>
left
the
room
and
did
not
forget
to
shut
the
door
after
her
.
<EOS>
Then
followed
a
close
conference
between
the
new
allies
,
in
which
was
said
much
which
it
astonished
Mr.
Slope
to
say
and
the
bishop
to
hear
.
<EOS>
And
yet
the
one
said
it
and
the
other
heard
it
without
ill
-
will
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
mincing
of
matters
now
.
<EOS>
The
chaplain
plainly
told
the
bishop
that
the
world
gave
him
credit
for
being
under
the
governance
of
his
wife
;
that
his
credit
and
character
in
the
diocese
were
suffering
;
that
he
would
surely
get
himself
in
hot
water
if
he
allowed
Mrs.
Proudie
to
interfere
in
matters
which
were
not
suitable
for
a
woman
's
powers
;
and
in
fact
that
he
would
become
contemptible
if
he
did
not
throw
off
the
yoke
under
which
he
groaned
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
at
first
hummed
and
hawed
and
affected
to
deny
the
truth
of
what
was
said
.
<EOS>
But
his
denial
was
not
stout
and
quickly
broke
down
.
<EOS>
He
soon
admitted
by
silence
his
state
of
vassalage
and
pledged
himself
,
with
Mr.
Slope
's
assistance
,
to
change
his
courses
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
also
did
not
make
out
a
bad
case
for
himself
.
<EOS>
He
explained
how
it
grieved
him
to
run
counter
to
a
lady
who
had
always
been
his
patroness
,
who
had
befriended
him
in
so
many
ways
,
who
had
,
in
fact
,
recommended
him
to
the
bishop
's
notice
;
but
,
as
he
stated
,
his
duty
was
now
imperative
;
he
held
a
situation
of
peculiar
confidence
,
and
was
immediately
and
especially
attached
to
the
bishop
's
person
.
<EOS>
In
such
a
situation
his
conscience
required
that
he
should
regard
solely
the
bishop
's
interests
,
and
therefore
he
had
ventured
to
speak
out
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
took
this
for
what
it
was
worth
,
and
Mr.
Slope
only
intended
that
he
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
It
gilded
the
pill
which
Mr.
Slope
had
to
administer
,
and
which
the
bishop
thought
would
be
less
bitter
than
that
other
pill
which
he
had
so
long
been
taking
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
had
his
immediate
reward
,
like
a
good
child
.
<EOS>
He
was
instructed
to
write
and
at
once
did
write
another
note
to
the
archbishop
accepting
his
grace
's
invitation
.
<EOS>
This
note
Mr.
Slope
,
more
prudent
than
the
lady
,
himself
took
away
and
posted
with
his
own
hands
.
<EOS>
Thus
he
made
sure
that
this
act
of
self
-
jurisdiction
should
be
as
nearly
as
possible
a
_
fait
accompli
_
.
<EOS>
He
begged
,
and
coaxed
,
and
threatened
the
bishop
with
a
view
of
making
him
also
write
at
once
to
Mr.
Harding
,
but
the
bishop
,
though
temporally
emancipated
from
his
wife
,
was
not
yet
enthralled
to
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
and
probably
said
truly
,
that
such
an
offer
must
be
made
in
some
official
form
;
that
he
was
not
yet
prepared
to
sign
the
form
;
and
that
he
should
prefer
seeing
Mr.
Harding
before
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
might
,
however
,
beg
Mr.
Harding
to
call
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Not
disappointed
with
his
achievement
Mr.
Slope
went
his
way
.
<EOS>
He
first
posted
the
precious
note
which
he
had
in
his
pocket
,
and
then
pursued
other
enterprises
in
which
we
must
follow
him
in
other
chapters
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
,
having
received
such
satisfaction
as
was
to
be
derived
from
slamming
her
husband
's
door
,
did
not
at
once
betake
herself
to
Mrs.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
for
the
first
few
moments
after
her
repulse
she
felt
that
she
could
not
again
see
that
lady
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
to
own
that
she
had
been
beaten
,
to
confess
that
the
diadem
had
passed
from
her
brow
,
and
the
sceptre
from
her
hand
!
<EOS>
No
,
she
would
send
a
message
to
her
with
a
promise
of
a
letter
on
the
next
day
or
the
day
after
.
<EOS>
Thus
resolving
,
she
betook
herself
to
her
bedroom
,
but
here
she
again
changed
her
mind
.
<EOS>
The
air
of
that
sacred
enclosure
somewhat
restored
her
courage
and
gave
her
more
heart
.
<EOS>
As
Achilles
warmed
at
the
sight
of
his
armour
,
as
Don
Quixote
's
heart
grew
strong
when
he
grasped
his
lance
,
so
did
Mrs.
Proudie
look
forward
to
fresh
laurels
,
as
her
eye
fell
on
her
husband
's
pillow
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
despair
.
<EOS>
Having
so
resolved
,
she
descended
with
dignified
mien
and
refreshed
countenance
to
Mrs.
Quiverful
.
  
<EOS>
This
scene
in
the
bishop
's
study
took
longer
in
the
acting
than
in
the
telling
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
,
perhaps
,
had
the
whole
of
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
Mrs.
Quiverful
was
beginning
to
be
very
impatient
,
and
was
thinking
that
Farmer
Subsoil
would
be
tired
of
waiting
for
her
,
when
Mrs.
Proudie
returned
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
who
can
tell
the
palpitations
of
that
maternal
heart
,
as
the
suppliant
looked
into
the
face
of
the
great
lady
to
see
written
there
<EOS>
either
a
promise
of
house
,
income
,
comfort
and
future
competence
,
or
else
the
doom
of
continued
and
ever
-
increasing
poverty
!
<EOS>
Poor
mother
!
<EOS>
Poor
wife
!
<EOS>
There
was
little
there
to
comfort
you
!
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
"
thus
spoke
the
lady
with
considerable
austerity
,
and
without
sitting
down
herself
,
"
I
find
that
your
husband
has
behaved
in
this
matter
in
a
very
weak
and
foolish
manner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
immediately
rose
upon
her
feet
,
thinking
it
disrespectful
to
remain
sitting
while
the
wife
of
the
bishop
stood
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
desired
to
sit
down
again
,
and
made
to
do
so
,
so
that
Mrs.
Proudie
might
stand
and
preach
over
her
.
<EOS>
It
is
generally
considered
an
offensive
thing
for
a
gentleman
to
keep
his
seat
while
another
is
kept
standing
before
him
,
and
we
presume
the
same
law
holds
with
regard
to
ladies
.
<EOS>
It
often
is
so
felt
,
but
we
are
inclined
to
say
that
it
never
produces
half
the
discomfort
or
half
the
feeling
of
implied
inferiority
that
is
shown
by
a
great
man
who
desires
his
visitor
to
be
seated
while
he
himself
speaks
from
his
legs
.
<EOS>
Such
a
solecism
in
good
breeding
,
when
construed
into
English
,
means
this
:
"
The
accepted
rules
of
courtesy
in
the
world
require
that
I
should
offer
you
a
seat
;
if
I
did
not
do
so
,
you
would
bring
a
charge
against
me
in
the
world
of
being
arrogant
and
ill
-
mannered
;
I
will
obey
the
world
,
but
,
nevertheless
,
I
will
not
put
myself
on
an
equality
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
may
sit
down
,
but
I
wo
n't
sit
with
you
.
<EOS>
Sit
,
therefore
,
at
my
bidding
,
and
I
'll
stand
and
talk
at
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
just
what
Mrs.
Proudie
meant
to
say
,
and
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
though
she
was
too
anxious
and
too
flurried
thus
to
translate
the
full
meaning
of
the
manoeuvre
,
did
not
fail
to
feel
its
effect
.
<EOS>
She
was
cowed
and
uncomfortable
,
and
a
second
time
essayed
to
rise
from
her
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
be
seated
,
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
pray
keep
your
seat
.
<EOS>
Your
husband
,
I
say
,
has
been
most
weak
and
most
foolish
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
,
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
to
help
people
who
will
not
help
themselves
.
<EOS>
I
much
fear
that
I
can
now
do
nothing
for
you
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mrs.
Proudie
,
do
n't
say
so
,
"
said
the
poor
woman
,
again
jumping
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
Pray
_
be
seated
,
Mrs.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
I
must
fear
that
I
can
do
nothing
further
for
you
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
Your
husband
has
,
in
a
most
unaccountable
manner
,
taken
upon
himself
to
resign
that
which
I
was
empowered
to
offer
him
.
<EOS>
As
a
matter
of
course
,
the
bishop
expects
that
his
clergy
shall
know
their
own
minds
.
<EOS>
What
he
may
ultimately
do
 
what
we
may
finally
decide
on
doing
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
now
say
.
<EOS>
Knowing
the
extent
of
your
family
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Fourteen
children
,
Mrs.
Proudie
,
fourteen
of
them
!
<EOS>
And
barely
bread
 
<EOS>
barely
bread
?
<EOS>
It
's
hard
for
the
children
of
a
clergyman
,
it
's
hard
for
one
who
has
always
done
his
duty
respectably
!
"
<EOS>
Not
a
word
fell
from
her
about
herself
,
but
the
tears
came
streaming
down
her
big
,
coarse
cheeks
,
on
which
the
dust
of
the
August
road
had
left
its
traces
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
has
not
been
portrayed
in
these
pages
as
an
agreeable
or
an
amiable
lady
.
<EOS>
There
has
been
no
intention
to
impress
the
reader
much
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
It
is
ordained
that
all
novels
should
have
a
male
and
a
female
angel
and
a
male
and
a
female
devil
.
<EOS>
If
it
be
considered
that
this
rule
is
obeyed
in
these
pages
,
the
latter
character
must
be
supposed
to
have
fallen
to
the
lot
of
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
not
all
devil
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
heart
inside
that
stiff
-
ribbed
bodice
,
though
not
,
perhaps
,
of
large
dimensions
,
and
certainly
not
easily
accessible
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
however
,
did
gain
access
,
and
Mrs.
Proudie
proved
herself
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
the
fourteen
children
with
their
probable
bare
bread
and
their
possible
bare
backs
,
or
the
respectability
of
the
father
's
work
,
or
the
mingled
dust
and
tears
on
the
mother
's
face
,
we
will
not
pretend
to
say
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Proudie
was
touched
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
show
it
as
other
women
might
have
done
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
give
Mrs.
Quiverful
eau
-
de
-
Cologne
,
or
order
her
a
glass
of
wine
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
take
her
to
her
toilet
table
and
offer
her
the
use
of
brushes
and
combs
,
towels
and
water
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
say
soft
little
speeches
and
coax
her
kindly
back
to
equanimity
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
despite
her
rough
appearance
,
would
have
been
as
amenable
to
such
little
tender
cares
as
any
lady
in
the
land
.
<EOS>
But
none
such
were
forthcoming
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
this
,
Mrs.
Proudie
slapped
one
hand
upon
the
other
and
declared
 
not
with
an
oath
,
for
,
as
a
lady
and
a
Sabbatarian
and
a
she
-
bishop
,
she
could
not
swear
,
but
with
an
adjuration
 
that
she
"
would
n't
have
it
done
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
meaning
of
this
was
that
she
would
n't
have
Mr.
Quiverful
's
promised
appointment
cozened
away
by
the
treachery
of
Mr.
Slope
and
the
weakness
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
This
meaning
she
very
soon
explained
to
Mrs.
Quiverful
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
was
your
husband
such
a
fool
,
"
said
she
,
now
dismounted
from
her
high
horse
and
sitting
confidentially
down
close
to
her
visitor
,
"
as
to
take
the
bait
which
that
man
threw
to
him
?
<EOS>
If
he
had
not
been
so
utterly
foolish
,
nothing
could
have
prevented
your
going
to
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Quiverful
was
ready
enough
with
her
own
tongue
in
accusing
her
husband
to
his
face
of
being
soft
,
and
perhaps
did
not
always
speak
of
him
to
her
children
quite
so
respectfully
as
she
might
have
done
.
<EOS>
But
she
did
not
at
all
like
to
hear
him
abused
by
others
,
and
began
to
vindicate
him
and
to
explain
that
of
course
he
had
taken
Mr.
Slope
to
be
an
emissary
from
Mrs.
Proudie
herself
;
that
Mr.
Slope
was
thought
to
be
peculiarly
her
friend
;
and
that
,
therefore
,
Mr.
Quiverful
would
have
been
failing
in
respect
to
her
<EOS>
had
he
assumed
to
doubt
what
Mr.
Slope
had
said
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
mollified
,
Mrs.
Proudie
again
declared
that
she
"
would
not
have
it
done
,
"
and
at
last
sent
Mrs.
Quiverful
home
with
an
assurance
that
,
to
the
furthest
stretch
of
her
power
and
influence
in
the
palace
,
the
appointment
of
Mr.
Quiverful
should
be
insisted
on
.
<EOS>
As
she
repeated
the
word
"
insisted
,
"
she
thought
of
the
bishop
in
his
night
-
cap
and
,
with
compressed
lips
,
slightly
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
aspiring
pastors
,
divines
to
whose
ears
<EOS>
_
nolo
episcopari
_
are
the
sweetest
of
words
,
which
of
you
would
be
a
bishop
on
such
terms
as
these
?
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
got
home
in
the
farmer
's
cart
,
not
indeed
with
a
light
heart
,
but
satisfied
that
she
had
done
right
in
making
her
visit
.
   
<EOS>
A
Love
Scene
 
Mr.
Slope
,
as
we
have
said
,
left
the
palace
with
a
feeling
of
considerable
triumph
.
<EOS>
Not
that
he
thought
that
his
difficulties
were
all
over
 
he
did
not
so
deceive
himself
 
<EOS>
but
he
felt
that
he
had
played
his
first
move
well
,
as
well
as
the
pieces
on
the
board
would
allow
,
and
that
he
had
nothing
with
which
to
reproach
himself
.
<EOS>
He
first
of
all
posted
the
letter
to
the
archbishop
and
,
having
made
that
sure
,
proceeded
to
push
the
advantage
which
he
had
gained
.
<EOS>
Had
Mrs.
Bold
been
at
home
,
he
would
have
called
on
her
,
but
he
knew
that
she
was
at
Plumstead
,
so
he
wrote
the
following
note
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
beginning
of
what
,
he
trusted
,
might
be
a
long
and
tender
series
of
epistles
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
MRS
.
<EOS>
BOLD
,
  
<EOS>
You
will
understand
perfectly
that
I
can
not
at
present
correspond
with
your
father
.
<EOS>
I
heartily
wish
that
I
could
,
and
hope
the
day
may
be
not
long
distant
when
mists
shall
have
been
cleared
away
,
and
we
may
know
each
other
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
preclude
myself
from
the
pleasure
of
sending
you
these
few
lines
to
say
that
Mr.
Q.
has
to
-
day
,
in
my
presence
,
resigned
any
title
that
he
ever
had
to
the
wardenship
of
the
hospital
,
and
that
the
bishop
has
assured
me
that
it
is
his
intention
to
offer
it
to
your
esteemed
father
.
  
<EOS>
Will
you
,
with
my
respectful
compliments
,
ask
him
,
who
I
believe
is
now
a
fellow
-
visitor
with
you
,
to
call
on
the
bishop
either
on
Wednesday
or
Thursday
,
between
ten
and
one
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
This
is
by
the
bishop
's
desire
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
so
far
oblige
me
as
to
let
me
have
a
line
naming
either
day
,
and
the
hour
which
will
suit
Mr.
Harding
,
I
will
take
care
that
the
servants
shall
have
orders
to
show
him
in
without
delay
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
should
say
no
more
 
<EOS>
but
still
I
wish
you
could
make
your
father
understand
that
no
subject
will
be
mooted
between
his
lordship
and
him
which
will
refer
at
all
to
the
method
in
which
he
may
choose
to
perform
his
duty
.
<EOS>
I
for
one
am
persuaded
that
no
clergyman
could
perform
it
more
satisfactorily
than
he
did
,
or
than
he
will
do
again
.
  
<EOS>
On
a
former
occasion
I
was
indiscreet
and
much
too
impatient
,
considering
your
father
's
age
and
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
not
now
refuse
my
apology
.
<EOS>
I
still
hope
also
that
with
your
aid
and
sweet
pious
labours
we
may
live
to
attach
such
a
Sabbath
-
school
to
the
old
endowment
as
may
,
by
God
's
grace
and
furtherance
,
be
a
blessing
to
the
poor
of
this
city
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
see
at
once
that
this
letter
is
confidential
.
<EOS>
The
subject
,
of
course
,
makes
it
so
.
<EOS>
But
,
equally
,
of
course
,
it
is
for
your
parent
's
eye
as
well
as
for
your
own
,
should
you
think
proper
to
show
it
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
my
darling
little
friend
Johnny
is
as
strong
as
ever
 
dear
little
fellow
.
<EOS>
Does
he
still
continue
his
rude
assaults
on
those
beautiful
long
silken
tresses
?
  
<EOS>
I
can
assure
you
your
friends
miss
you
from
Barchester
sorely
,
but
it
would
be
cruel
to
begrudge
you
your
sojourn
among
flowers
and
fields
during
this
truly
sultry
weather
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
believe
me
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Bold
,
Yours
most
sincerely
,
OBADIAH
SLOPE
  
Barchester
,
Friday
.
  
<EOS>
Now
this
letter
,
taken
as
a
whole
,
and
with
the
consideration
that
Mr.
Slope
wished
to
assume
a
great
degree
of
intimacy
with
Eleanor
,
would
not
have
been
bad
but
for
the
allusion
to
the
tresses
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
do
not
write
to
ladies
about
their
tresses
unless
they
are
on
very
intimate
terms
indeed
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Slope
could
not
be
expected
to
be
aware
of
this
.
<EOS>
He
longed
to
put
a
little
affection
into
his
epistle
,
and
yet
he
thought
it
injudicious
,
as
the
letter
would
,
he
knew
,
be
shown
to
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
insisted
that
the
letter
should
be
strictly
private
and
seen
by
no
eyes
but
Eleanor
's
own
,
had
he
not
felt
that
such
an
injunction
would
have
been
disobeyed
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
restrained
his
passion
,
did
not
sign
himself
"
yours
affectionately
,
"
and
contented
himself
instead
with
the
compliment
to
the
tresses
.
  
<EOS>
Having
finished
his
letter
,
he
took
it
to
Mrs.
Bold
's
house
and
,
learning
there
,
from
the
servant
,
that
things
were
to
be
sent
out
to
Plumstead
that
afternoon
,
left
it
,
with
many
injunctions
,
in
her
hands
.
  
<EOS>
We
will
now
follow
Mr.
Slope
so
as
to
complete
the
day
with
him
and
then
return
to
his
letter
and
its
momentous
fate
in
the
next
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
an
old
song
which
gives
us
some
very
good
advice
about
courting
:
    
<EOS>
It
's
gude
to
be
off
with
the
auld
luve
Before
ye
be
on
wi
'
the
new
.
  
<EOS>
Of
the
wisdom
of
this
maxim
Mr.
Slope
was
ignorant
,
and
accordingly
,
having
written
his
letter
to
Mrs.
Bold
,
he
proceeded
to
call
upon
the
Signora
Neroni
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
was
hard
to
say
which
was
the
old
love
and
which
the
new
,
Mr.
Slope
having
been
smitten
with
both
so
nearly
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
thought
it
not
amiss
to
have
two
strings
to
his
bow
.
<EOS>
But
two
strings
to
Cupid
's
bow
are
always
dangerous
to
him
on
whose
behalf
they
are
to
be
used
.
<EOS>
A
man
should
remember
that
between
two
stools
he
may
fall
to
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
But
in
sooth
Mr.
Slope
was
pursuing
Mrs.
Bold
in
obedience
to
his
better
instincts
,
and
the
signora
in
obedience
to
his
worser
.
<EOS>
Had
he
won
the
widow
and
worn
her
,
no
one
could
have
blamed
him
.
<EOS>
You
,
O
reader
,
and
I
,
and
Eleanor
's
other
friends
would
have
received
the
story
of
such
a
winning
with
much
disgust
and
disappointment
,
but
we
should
have
been
angry
with
Eleanor
,
not
with
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Bishop
,
male
and
female
,
dean
and
chapter
and
diocesan
clergy
in
full
congress
could
have
found
nothing
to
disapprove
of
in
such
an
alliance
.
<EOS>
Convocation
itself
,
that
mysterious
and
mighty
synod
,
could
in
no
wise
have
fallen
foul
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
possession
of
£
1000
a
year
and
a
beautiful
wife
would
not
at
all
have
hurt
the
voice
of
the
pulpit
charmer
,
or
lessened
the
grace
and
piety
of
the
exemplary
clergyman
.
  
<EOS>
But
not
of
such
a
nature
were
likely
to
be
his
dealings
with
the
Signora
Neroni
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
he
knew
that
her
husband
was
living
,
and
therefore
he
could
not
woo
her
honestly
.
<EOS>
Then
again
she
had
nothing
to
recommend
her
to
his
honest
wooing
,
had
such
been
possible
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
only
portionless
,
but
also
from
misfortune
unfitted
to
be
chosen
as
the
wife
of
any
man
who
wanted
a
useful
mate
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
was
aware
that
she
was
a
helpless
,
hopeless
cripple
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Slope
could
not
help
himself
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
was
wrong
in
devoting
his
time
to
the
back
drawing
-
room
in
Dr.
Stanhope
's
house
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
what
took
place
there
would
,
if
divulged
,
utterly
ruin
him
with
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
scandal
would
soon
come
upon
his
heels
and
spread
abroad
among
the
black
coats
of
Barchester
some
tidings
,
exaggerated
tidings
,
of
the
sighs
which
he
poured
into
the
lady
's
ears
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
was
acting
against
the
recognized
principles
of
his
life
,
against
those
laws
of
conduct
by
which
he
hoped
to
achieve
much
higher
success
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
we
have
said
,
he
could
not
help
himself
.
<EOS>
Passion
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
passion
was
too
strong
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
the
signora
,
no
such
plea
can
be
put
forward
for
her
,
for
in
truth
she
cared
no
more
for
Mr.
Slope
than
she
did
for
twenty
others
who
had
been
at
her
feet
before
him
.
<EOS>
She
willingly
,
nay
greedily
,
accepted
his
homage
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
finest
fly
that
Barchester
had
hitherto
afforded
to
her
web
,
and
the
signora
was
a
powerful
spider
that
made
wondrous
webs
,
and
could
in
no
way
live
without
catching
flies
.
<EOS>
Her
taste
in
this
respect
was
abominable
,
for
she
had
no
use
for
the
victims
when
caught
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
eat
them
matrimonially
,
as
young
lady
flies
do
whose
webs
are
most
frequently
of
their
mothers
"
weaving
.
<EOS>
Nor
could
she
devour
them
by
any
escapade
of
a
less
legitimate
description
.
<EOS>
Her
unfortunate
affliction
precluded
her
from
all
hope
of
levanting
with
a
lover
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
impossible
to
run
away
with
a
lady
who
required
three
servants
to
move
her
from
a
sofa
.
  
<EOS>
The
signora
was
subdued
by
no
passion
.
<EOS>
Her
time
for
love
was
gone
.
<EOS>
She
had
lived
out
her
heart
,
such
heart
as
she
had
ever
had
,
in
her
early
years
,
at
an
age
when
Mr.
Slope
was
thinking
of
the
second
book
of
Euclid
and
his
unpaid
bill
at
the
buttery
hatch
.
<EOS>
In
age
the
lady
was
younger
than
the
gentleman
,
but
in
feelings
,
in
knowledge
of
the
affairs
of
love
,
in
intrigue
,
he
was
immeasurably
her
junior
.
<EOS>
It
was
necessary
to
her
to
have
some
man
at
her
feet
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
one
customary
excitement
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
She
delighted
in
the
exercise
of
power
which
this
gave
her
;
it
was
now
nearly
the
only
food
for
her
ambition
;
she
would
boast
to
her
sister
that
she
could
make
a
fool
of
any
man
,
and
the
sister
,
as
little
imbued
with
feminine
delicacy
as
herself
,
good
-
naturedly
thought
it
but
fair
that
such
amusement
should
be
afforded
to
a
poor
invalid
who
was
debarred
from
the
ordinary
pleasures
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
was
madly
in
love
but
hardly
knew
it
.
<EOS>
The
Signora
spitted
him
,
as
a
boy
does
a
cockchafer
on
a
cork
,
that
she
might
enjoy
the
energetic
agony
of
his
gyrations
.
<EOS>
And
she
knew
very
well
what
she
was
doing
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
having
added
to
his
person
all
such
adornments
as
are
possible
to
a
clergyman
making
a
morning
visit
 
such
as
a
clean
necktie
,
clean
handkerchief
,
new
gloves
,
and
a
_
soupçon
_
of
not
unnecessary
scent
 
called
about
three
o'clock
at
the
doctor
's
door
.
<EOS>
At
about
this
hour
the
signora
was
almost
always
alone
in
the
back
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
mother
had
not
come
down
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
was
out
or
in
his
own
room
.
<EOS>
Bertie
was
out
,
and
Charlotte
at
any
rate
left
the
room
if
anyone
called
whose
object
was
specially
with
her
sister
.
<EOS>
Such
was
her
idea
of
being
charitable
and
sisterly
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
as
was
his
custom
,
asked
for
Mr.
Stanhope
,
and
was
told
,
as
was
the
servant
's
custom
,
that
the
signora
was
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Upstairs
he
accordingly
went
.
<EOS>
He
found
her
,
as
he
always
did
,
lying
on
her
sofa
with
a
French
volume
before
her
and
a
beautiful
little
inlaid
writing
-
case
open
on
her
table
.
<EOS>
At
the
moment
of
his
entrance
she
was
in
the
act
of
writing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
my
friend
,
"
said
she
,
putting
out
her
left
hand
to
him
across
her
desk
,
"
I
did
not
expect
you
to
-
day
and
was
this
very
instant
writing
to
you
 
"
  
Mr.
Slope
,
taking
the
soft
,
fair
,
delicate
hand
in
his
 
and
very
soft
and
fair
and
delicate
<EOS>
it
was
 
<EOS>
bowed
over
it
his
huge
red
head
and
kissed
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
sight
to
see
,
a
deed
to
record
if
the
author
could
fitly
do
it
,
a
picture
to
put
on
canvas
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
was
big
,
awkward
,
cumbrous
,
and
,
having
his
heart
in
his
pursuit
,
was
ill
at
ease
.
<EOS>
The
lady
was
fair
,
as
we
have
said
,
and
delicate
;
everything
about
her
was
fine
and
refined
;
her
hand
in
his
looked
like
a
rose
lying
among
carrots
,
and
when
he
kissed
it
,
he
looked
as
a
cow
might
do
on
finding
such
a
flower
among
her
food
.
<EOS>
She
was
graceful
as
a
couchant
goddess
and
,
moreover
,
as
self
-
possessed
as
Venus
must
have
been
when
courting
Adonis
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
such
grace
and
such
beauty
should
have
condescended
to
waste
itself
on
such
a
pursuit
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
in
the
act
of
writing
to
you
,
"
said
she
,
"
but
now
my
scrawl
may
go
into
the
basket
;
"
and
she
raised
the
sheet
of
gilded
note
-
paper
from
off
her
desk
as
though
to
tear
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
it
shall
not
,
"
said
he
,
laying
the
embargo
of
half
a
stone
weight
of
human
flesh
and
blood
upon
the
devoted
paper
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nothing
that
you
write
for
my
eyes
,
signora
,
shall
be
so
desecrated
,
"
and
he
took
up
the
letter
,
put
that
also
among
the
carrots
and
fed
on
it
,
and
then
proceeded
to
read
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gracious
me
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
hope
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
keep
all
the
trash
I
write
to
you
.
<EOS>
Half
my
time
I
do
n't
know
what
I
write
,
and
when
I
do
,
I
know
it
is
only
fit
for
the
back
of
the
fire
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
not
that
ugly
trick
of
keeping
letters
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
At
any
rate
,
I
do
n't
throw
them
into
a
waste
-
paper
basket
.
<EOS>
If
destruction
is
their
doomed
lot
,
they
perish
worthily
,
and
are
burnt
on
a
pyre
,
as
Dido
was
of
old
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
a
steel
pen
stuck
through
them
,
of
course
,
"
said
she
,
"
to
make
the
simile
more
complete
.
<EOS>
Of
all
the
ladies
of
my
acquaintance
I
think
Lady
Dido
was
the
most
absurd
.
<EOS>
Why
did
she
not
do
as
Cleopatra
did
?
<EOS>
Why
did
she
not
take
out
her
ships
and
insist
on
going
with
him
?
<EOS>
She
could
not
bear
to
lose
the
land
she
had
got
by
a
swindle
,
and
then
she
could
not
bear
the
loss
of
her
lover
.
<EOS>
So
she
fell
between
two
stools
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
whatever
you
do
,
never
mingle
love
and
business
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
blushed
up
to
his
eyes
and
over
his
mottled
forehead
to
the
very
roots
of
his
hair
.
<EOS>
He
felt
sure
that
the
signora
knew
all
about
his
intentions
with
reference
to
Mrs
Bold
.
<EOS>
His
conscience
told
him
that
he
was
detected
.
<EOS>
His
doom
was
to
be
spoken
;
he
was
to
be
punished
for
his
duplicity
,
and
rejected
by
the
beautiful
creature
before
him
.
<EOS>
Poor
man
.
<EOS>
He
little
dreamt
that
had
all
his
intentions
with
reference
to
Mrs.
Bold
been
known
to
the
signora
,
it
would
only
have
added
zest
to
that
lady
's
amusement
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
very
well
to
have
Mr.
Slope
at
her
feet
,
to
show
her
power
by
making
an
utter
fool
of
a
clergyman
,
to
gratify
her
own
infidelity
by
thus
proving
the
little
strength
which
religion
had
in
controlling
the
passions
even
of
a
religious
man
;
but
it
would
be
an
increased
gratification
if
she
could
be
made
to
understand
that
she
was
at
the
same
time
alluring
her
victim
away
from
another
,
whose
love
if
secured
would
be
in
every
way
beneficent
and
salutary
.
  
<EOS>
The
Signora
had
indeed
discovered
,
with
the
keen
instinct
of
such
a
woman
,
that
Mr.
Slope
was
bent
on
matrimony
with
Mrs.
Bold
,
but
in
alluding
to
Dido
she
had
not
thought
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
instantly
perceived
,
however
,
from
her
lover
's
blushes
,
what
was
on
his
mind
and
was
not
slow
in
taking
advantage
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
looked
him
full
in
the
face
,
not
angrily
,
nor
yet
with
a
smile
,
but
with
an
intense
and
overpowering
gaze
;
then
,
holding
up
her
forefinger
and
slightly
shaking
her
head
,
she
said
:
    
<EOS>
"
Whatever
you
do
,
my
friend
,
do
not
mingle
love
and
business
.
<EOS>
Either
stick
to
your
treasure
and
your
city
of
wealth
,
or
else
follow
your
love
like
a
true
man
.
<EOS>
But
never
attempt
both
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
,
you
'll
have
to
die
with
a
broken
heart
as
did
poor
Dido
.
<EOS>
Which
is
it
to
be
with
you
,
Mr.
Slope
,
love
or
money
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
was
not
so
ready
with
a
pathetic
answer
as
he
usually
was
with
touching
episodes
in
his
extempore
sermons
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
he
ought
to
say
something
pretty
,
something
also
that
should
remove
the
impression
on
the
mind
of
his
lady
-
love
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
rather
put
about
how
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Love
,
"
said
he
,
"
true
overpowering
love
,
must
be
the
strongest
passion
a
man
can
feel
;
it
must
control
every
other
wish
,
and
put
aside
every
other
pursuit
.
<EOS>
But
with
me
love
will
never
act
in
that
way
unless
it
be
returned
;
"
and
he
threw
upon
the
signora
a
look
of
tenderness
which
was
intended
to
make
up
for
all
the
deficiencies
of
his
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
my
advice
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
love
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
what
is
it
?
<EOS>
The
dream
of
a
few
weeks
.
<EOS>
That
is
all
its
joy
.
<EOS>
The
disappointment
of
a
life
is
its
Nemesis
.
<EOS>
Who
was
ever
successful
in
true
love
?
<EOS>
Success
in
love
argues
that
the
love
is
false
.
<EOS>
True
love
is
always
despondent
or
tragical
.
<EOS>
Juliet
loved
,
Haidee
loved
,
Dido
loved
,
and
what
came
of
it
?
<EOS>
Troilus
loved
and
ceased
to
be
a
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Troilus
loved
and
was
fooled
,
"
said
the
more
manly
chaplain
.
<EOS>
"
A
man
may
love
and
yet
not
be
a
Troilus
.
<EOS>
All
women
are
not
Cressidas
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
all
women
are
not
Cressidas
.
<EOS>
The
falsehood
is
not
always
on
the
woman
's
side
.
<EOS>
Imogen
was
true
,
but
how
was
she
rewarded
?
<EOS>
Her
lord
believed
her
to
be
the
paramour
of
the
first
he
who
came
near
her
in
his
absence
.
<EOS>
Desdemona
was
true
and
was
smothered
.
<EOS>
Ophelia
was
true
and
went
mad
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
happiness
in
love
,
except
at
the
end
of
an
English
novel
.
<EOS>
But
in
wealth
,
money
,
houses
,
lands
,
goods
,
and
chattels
,
in
the
good
things
of
this
world
,
yes
,
in
them
there
is
something
tangible
,
something
that
can
be
retained
and
enjoyed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
feeling
himself
bound
to
enter
some
protest
against
so
very
unorthodox
a
doctrine
,
"
this
world
's
wealth
will
make
no
one
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
will
make
you
happy
 
<EOS>
you
 
you
?
<EOS>
"
said
she
,
raising
herself
up
and
speaking
to
him
with
energy
across
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
From
what
source
do
you
look
for
happiness
?
<EOS>
Do
not
say
that
you
look
for
none
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
believe
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
search
in
which
every
human
being
spends
an
existence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
the
search
is
always
in
vain
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
We
look
for
happiness
on
earth
,
while
we
ought
to
be
content
to
hope
for
it
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
You
preach
a
doctrine
which
you
know
you
do
n't
believe
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
way
with
you
all
.
<EOS>
If
you
know
that
there
is
no
earthly
happiness
,
why
do
you
long
to
be
a
bishop
or
a
dean
?
<EOS>
Why
do
you
want
lands
and
income
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
natural
ambition
of
a
man
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
have
,
and
the
natural
passions
;
and
therefore
I
say
that
you
do
n't
believe
the
doctrine
you
preach
.
<EOS>
St.
Paul
was
an
enthusiast
.
<EOS>
He
believed
so
that
his
ambition
and
passions
did
not
war
against
his
creed
.
<EOS>
So
does
the
Eastern
fanatic
who
passes
half
his
life
erect
upon
a
pillar
.
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
I
will
believe
in
no
belief
that
does
not
make
itself
manifest
by
outward
signs
.
<EOS>
I
will
think
no
preaching
sincere
that
is
not
recommended
by
the
practice
of
the
preacher
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
was
startled
and
horrified
,
but
he
felt
that
he
could
not
answer
.
<EOS>
How
could
he
stand
up
and
preach
the
lessons
of
his
Master
,
being
there
,
as
he
was
,
on
the
devil
's
business
?
<EOS>
He
was
a
true
believer
,
otherwise
this
would
have
been
nothing
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
audacity
for
most
things
,
but
he
had
not
audacity
to
make
a
plaything
of
the
Lord
's
word
.
<EOS>
All
this
the
signora
understood
,
and
felt
much
interest
as
she
saw
her
cockchafer
whirl
round
upon
her
pin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
wit
delights
in
such
arguments
,
"
said
he
,
"
but
your
heart
and
your
reason
do
not
go
along
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
heart
!
<EOS>
"
said
she
;
"
you
quite
mistake
the
principles
of
my
composition
if
you
imagine
that
there
is
such
a
thing
about
me
.
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
there
was
very
little
that
was
false
in
anything
that
the
signora
said
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Slope
allowed
himself
to
be
deceived
,
it
was
his
own
fault
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
have
been
more
open
than
her
declarations
about
herself
.
  
<EOS>
The
little
writing
-
table
with
her
desk
was
still
standing
before
her
,
a
barrier
,
as
it
were
,
against
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
She
was
sitting
as
nearly
upright
as
she
ever
did
,
and
he
had
brought
a
chair
close
to
the
sofa
,
so
that
there
was
only
the
corner
of
the
table
between
him
and
her
.
<EOS>
It
so
happened
that
as
she
spoke
her
hand
lay
upon
the
table
,
and
as
Mr.
Slope
answered
her
he
put
his
hand
upon
hers
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
heart
!
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
heavy
charge
which
you
bring
against
yourself
,
and
one
of
which
I
can
not
find
you
guilty
 
<EOS>
"
  
She
withdrew
her
hand
,
not
quickly
and
angrily
,
as
though
insulted
by
his
touch
,
but
gently
and
slowly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
no
condition
to
give
a
verdict
on
the
matter
,
"
said
she
,
"
as
you
have
not
tried
me
.
<EOS>
No
,
do
n't
say
that
you
intend
doing
so
,
for
you
know
you
have
no
intention
of
the
kind
;
nor
indeed
have
I
,
either
.
<EOS>
As
for
you
,
you
will
take
your
vows
where
they
will
result
in
something
more
substantial
than
the
pursuit
of
such
a
ghostlike
,
ghastly
love
as
mine
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Your
love
should
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
dream
of
a
monarch
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
not
quite
clear
as
to
the
meaning
of
his
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
an
archbishop
,
Mr.
Slope
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
She
was
very
cruel
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
went
round
again
upon
his
cork
on
this
allusion
to
his
profession
.
<EOS>
He
tried
,
however
,
to
smile
and
gently
accused
her
of
joking
on
a
matter
,
which
was
,
he
said
,
to
him
of
such
vital
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
 
what
gulls
do
you
men
make
of
us
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
How
you
fool
us
to
the
top
of
our
bent
;
and
of
all
men
you
clergymen
are
the
most
fluent
of
your
honeyed
,
caressing
words
.
<EOS>
Now
look
me
in
the
face
,
Mr.
Slope
,
boldly
and
openly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
did
look
at
her
with
a
languishing
loving
eye
,
and
as
he
did
so
he
again
put
forth
his
hand
to
get
hold
of
hers
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
to
look
at
me
boldly
,
Mr.
Slope
,
but
confine
your
boldness
to
your
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Madeline
!
"
<EOS>
he
sighed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
name
is
Madeline
,
"
said
she
,
"
but
none
except
my
own
family
usually
call
me
so
.
<EOS>
Now
look
me
in
the
face
,
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Am
I
to
understand
that
you
say
you
love
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
never
had
said
so
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
come
there
with
any
formed
plan
at
all
,
his
intention
was
to
make
love
to
the
lady
without
uttering
any
such
declaration
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
however
,
quite
impossible
that
he
should
now
deny
his
love
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
therefore
,
nothing
for
it
<EOS>
but
to
go
down
on
his
knees
distractedly
against
the
sofa
and
swear
that
he
did
love
her
with
a
love
passing
the
love
of
man
.
  
<EOS>
The
signora
received
the
assurance
with
very
little
palpitation
or
appearance
of
surprise
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
answer
me
another
question
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
are
you
to
be
married
to
my
dear
friend
Eleanor
Bold
?
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Slope
went
round
and
round
in
mortal
agony
.
<EOS>
In
such
a
condition
as
his
it
was
really
very
hard
for
him
to
know
what
answer
to
give
.
<EOS>
And
yet
no
answer
would
be
his
surest
condemnation
.
<EOS>
He
might
as
well
at
once
plead
guilty
to
the
charge
brought
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
do
you
accuse
me
of
such
dissimulation
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dissimulation
!
<EOS>
I
said
nothing
of
dissimulation
.
<EOS>
I
made
no
charge
against
you
,
and
make
none
.
<EOS>
Pray
do
n't
defend
yourself
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
swear
that
you
are
devoted
to
my
beauty
,
and
yet
you
are
on
the
eve
of
matrimony
with
another
.
<EOS>
I
feel
this
to
be
rather
a
compliment
.
<EOS>
It
is
to
Mrs.
Bold
that
you
must
defend
yourself
.
<EOS>
That
you
may
find
difficult
;
unless
,
indeed
,
you
can
keep
her
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
You
clergymen
are
cleverer
than
other
men
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Signora
,
I
have
told
you
that
I
loved
you
,
and
now
you
rail
at
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Rail
at
you
.
<EOS>
God
bless
the
man
;
what
would
he
have
?
<EOS>
Come
,
answer
me
this
at
your
leisure
 
not
without
thinking
now
,
but
leisurely
and
with
consideration
 
are
you
not
going
to
be
married
to
Mrs.
Bold
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
said
it
he
almost
hated
,
with
an
exquisite
hatred
,
the
woman
whom
he
could
not
help
loving
with
an
exquisite
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
surely
you
are
a
worshipper
of
hers
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
to
whom
the
word
worshipper
was
peculiarly
distasteful
.
<EOS>
The
signora
had
conceived
that
it
would
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
at
that
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
not
admire
her
?
<EOS>
To
my
eye
she
is
the
perfection
of
English
beauty
.
<EOS>
And
then
she
is
rich
,
too
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
thought
she
was
just
the
person
to
attract
you
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Mr.
Slope
,
let
me
give
you
advice
on
this
matter
.
<EOS>
Marry
the
charming
widow
;
she
will
be
a
good
mother
to
your
children
and
an
excellent
mistress
of
a
clergyman
's
household
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
signora
,
how
can
you
be
so
cruel
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cruel
,
"
said
she
,
changing
the
voice
of
banter
which
she
had
been
using
for
one
which
was
expressively
earnest
in
its
tone
;
"
is
that
cruelty
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
love
another
while
my
heart
is
entirely
your
own
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
that
were
cruelty
,
Mr.
Slope
,
what
might
you
say
of
me
if
I
were
to
declare
that
I
returned
your
passion
?
<EOS>
What
would
you
think
if
I
bound
you
even
by
a
lover
's
oath
to
do
daily
penance
at
this
couch
of
mine
?
<EOS>
What
can
I
give
in
return
for
a
man
's
love
?
<EOS>
Ah
,
dear
friend
,
you
have
not
realized
the
conditions
of
my
fate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
was
not
on
his
knees
all
this
time
.
<EOS>
After
his
declaration
of
love
,
he
had
risen
from
them
as
quickly
as
he
thought
consistent
with
the
new
position
which
he
now
filled
,
and
as
he
stood
was
leaning
on
the
back
of
his
chair
.
<EOS>
This
outburst
of
tenderness
on
the
signora
's
part
quite
overcame
him
and
made
him
feel
for
the
moment
that
he
could
sacrifice
everything
to
be
assured
of
the
love
of
the
beautiful
creature
before
him
,
maimed
,
lame
,
and
already
married
as
she
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
can
I
not
sympathize
with
your
lot
?
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
now
seating
himself
on
her
sofa
and
pushing
away
the
table
with
his
foot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sympathy
is
so
near
to
pity
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
pity
me
,
cripple
as
I
am
,
I
shall
spurn
you
from
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Madeline
,
I
will
only
love
you
,
"
and
again
he
caught
her
hand
and
devoured
it
with
kisses
.
<EOS>
Now
she
did
not
draw
it
from
him
,
but
sat
there
as
he
kissed
it
,
looking
at
him
with
her
great
eyes
,
just
as
a
great
spider
would
look
at
a
great
fly
that
was
quite
securely
caught
.
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
Signor
Neroni
were
to
come
to
Barchester
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
you
make
his
acquaintance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Signor
Neroni
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
introduce
him
to
the
bishop
,
and
Mrs.
Proudie
,
and
the
young
ladies
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
again
having
recourse
to
that
horrid
quizzing
voice
which
Mr.
Slope
so
particularly
hated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
ask
such
a
question
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
know
that
there
is
a
Signor
Neroni
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
had
forgotten
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
thought
that
you
retained
for
that
wretch
one
particle
of
the
love
of
which
he
was
never
worthy
,
I
would
die
before
I
would
distract
you
by
telling
you
what
I
feel
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
Were
your
husband
the
master
of
your
heart
<EOS>
,
I
might
perhaps
love
you
,
but
you
should
never
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
heart
again
!
<EOS>
How
you
talk
.
<EOS>
And
you
consider
then
that
if
a
husband
be
not
master
of
his
wife
's
heart
,
he
has
no
right
to
her
fealty
;
if
a
wife
ceases
to
love
,
she
may
cease
to
be
true
.
<EOS>
Is
that
your
doctrine
on
this
matter
,
as
a
minister
of
the
Church
of
England
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
tried
hard
within
himself
to
cast
off
the
pollution
with
which
he
felt
that
he
was
defiling
his
soul
.
<EOS>
He
strove
to
tear
himself
away
from
the
noxious
siren
that
had
bewitched
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
again
heart
free
.
<EOS>
He
had
looked
for
rapturous
joy
in
loving
this
lovely
creature
,
and
he
already
found
that
he
met
with
little
but
disappointment
and
self
-
rebuke
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
across
the
fruit
of
the
Dead
Sea
,
so
sweet
and
delicious
to
the
eye
,
so
bitter
and
nauseous
to
the
taste
.
<EOS>
He
had
put
the
apple
to
his
mouth
,
and
it
had
turned
to
ashes
between
his
teeth
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
could
not
tear
himself
away
.
<EOS>
He
knew
,
he
could
not
but
know
,
that
she
jeered
at
him
,
ridiculed
his
love
,
and
insulted
the
weakness
of
his
religion
.
<EOS>
But
she
half
-
permitted
his
adoration
,
and
that
half
-
permission
added
such
fuel
to
his
fire
that
all
the
fountain
of
his
piety
could
not
quench
it
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
feel
savage
,
irritated
,
and
revengeful
.
<EOS>
He
meditated
some
severity
of
speech
,
some
taunt
that
should
cut
her
,
as
her
taunts
cut
him
.
<EOS>
He
reflected
as
he
stood
there
for
a
moment
,
silent
before
her
,
that
if
he
desired
to
quell
her
proud
spirit
,
he
should
do
so
by
being
prouder
even
than
herself
;
that
if
he
wished
to
have
her
at
his
feet
suppliant
for
his
love
,
it
behoved
him
to
conquer
her
by
indifference
.
<EOS>
All
this
passed
through
his
mind
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
dead
knowledge
went
,
he
knew
,
or
thought
he
knew
,
how
a
woman
should
be
tamed
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
essayed
to
bring
his
tactics
to
bear
,
he
failed
like
a
child
.
<EOS>
What
chance
has
dead
knowledge
with
experience
in
any
of
the
transactions
between
man
and
man
?
<EOS>
What
possible
chance
between
man
and
woman
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
loved
furiously
,
insanely
and
truly
,
but
he
had
never
played
the
game
of
love
.
<EOS>
The
signora
did
not
love
at
all
,
but
she
was
up
to
every
move
of
the
board
.
<EOS>
It
was
Philidor
pitted
against
a
schoolboy
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
she
continued
to
insult
him
,
and
he
continued
to
bear
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sacrifice
the
world
for
love
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
in
answer
to
some
renewed
vapid
declaration
of
his
passion
.
<EOS>
"
How
often
has
the
same
thing
been
said
,
and
how
invariably
with
the
same
falsehood
!
"
  
"
Falsehood
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
say
that
I
am
false
to
you
?
<EOS>
Do
you
say
that
my
love
is
not
real
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
False
?
<EOS>
Of
course
it
is
false
,
false
as
the
father
of
falsehood
 
if
indeed
falsehoods
need
a
sire
and
are
not
self
-
begotten
since
the
world
began
.
<EOS>
You
are
ready
to
sacrifice
the
world
for
love
?
<EOS>
Come
let
us
see
what
you
will
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
I
care
nothing
for
nuptial
vows
.
<EOS>
The
wretch
<EOS>
,
I
think
you
were
kind
enough
to
call
him
so
,
whom
I
swore
to
love
and
obey
<EOS>
is
so
base
that
he
can
only
be
thought
of
with
repulsive
disgust
.
<EOS>
In
the
council
chamber
of
my
heart
I
have
divorced
him
.
<EOS>
To
me
that
is
as
good
as
though
aged
lords
had
gloated
for
months
over
the
details
of
his
licentious
life
.
<EOS>
I
care
nothing
for
what
the
world
can
say
.
<EOS>
Will
you
be
as
frank
?
<EOS>
Will
you
take
me
to
your
home
as
your
wife
?
<EOS>
Will
you
call
me
Mrs.
Slope
before
bishop
,
dean
,
and
prebendaries
?
<EOS>
"
The
poor
tortured
wretch
stood
silent
,
not
knowing
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
do
that
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
then
,
what
part
of
the
world
is
it
that
you
will
sacrifice
for
my
charms
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Were
you
free
to
marry
,
I
would
take
you
to
my
house
to
-
morrow
and
wish
no
higher
privilege
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
free
,
"
said
she
,
almost
starting
up
in
her
energy
.
<EOS>
For
though
there
was
no
truth
in
her
pretended
regard
for
her
clerical
admirer
,
there
was
a
mixture
of
real
feeling
in
the
scorn
and
satire
with
which
she
spoke
of
love
and
marriage
generally
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
free
 
free
as
the
winds
.
<EOS>
Come
,
will
you
take
me
as
I
am
?
<EOS>
Have
your
wish
;
sacrifice
the
world
,
and
prove
yourself
a
true
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
should
have
taken
her
at
her
word
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
drawn
back
,
and
he
would
have
had
the
full
advantage
of
the
offer
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
doing
so
,
he
stood
wrapt
in
astonishment
,
passing
his
fingers
through
his
lank
red
hair
and
thinking
,
as
he
stared
upon
her
animated
countenance
,
that
her
wondrous
beauty
grew
more
wonderful
as
he
gazed
on
it
.
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
"
she
laughed
out
loud
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Mr.
Slope
,
do
n't
talk
of
sacrificing
the
world
again
.
<EOS>
People
beyond
one
-
and
-
twenty
should
never
dream
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
,
if
we
have
the
dregs
of
any
love
left
in
us
,
if
we
have
the
remnants
of
a
passion
remaining
in
our
hearts
,
should
husband
our
resources
better
.
<EOS>
We
are
not
in
our
première
jeunesse
.
<EOS>
The
world
is
a
very
nice
place
.
<EOS>
Your
world
,
at
any
rate
,
is
so
.
<EOS>
You
have
all
manner
of
fat
rectories
to
get
and
possible
bishoprics
to
enjoy
.
<EOS>
Come
,
confess
;
on
second
thoughts
you
would
not
sacrifice
such
things
for
the
smiles
of
a
lame
lady
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
for
him
to
answer
this
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
be
in
any
way
dignified
,
he
felt
that
he
must
be
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
"
said
she
,
"
do
n't
boody
with
me
:
do
n't
be
angry
because
I
speak
out
some
home
truths
.
<EOS>
Alas
,
the
world
,
as
I
have
found
it
,
has
taught
me
bitter
truths
.
<EOS>
Come
,
tell
me
that
I
am
forgiven
.
<EOS>
Are
we
not
to
be
friends
?
"
<EOS>
and
she
again
put
out
her
hand
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
sat
himself
down
in
the
chair
beside
her
,
took
her
proffered
hand
,
and
leant
over
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
said
she
with
her
sweetest
<EOS>
,
softest
smile
 
a
smile
to
withstand
which
a
man
should
be
cased
in
triple
steel
,
"
there
;
seal
your
forgiveness
on
it
,
"
and
she
raised
it
towards
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
kissed
it
again
and
again
,
and
stretched
over
her
as
though
desirous
of
extending
the
charity
of
his
pardon
beyond
the
hand
that
was
offered
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
managed
,
however
,
to
check
his
ardour
.
<EOS>
For
one
so
easily
allured
as
this
poor
chaplain
,
her
hand
was
surely
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Madeline
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
"
tell
me
that
you
love
me
 
<EOS>
do
you
 
<EOS>
do
you
love
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
my
mother
's
step
.
<EOS>
Our
_
tête
-
à
-
tête
_
has
been
of
monstrous
length
.
<EOS>
Now
you
had
better
go
.
<EOS>
But
we
shall
see
you
soon
again
,
shall
we
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
promised
that
he
would
call
again
on
the
following
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
,
Mr.
Slope
,
"
she
continued
,
"
pray
answer
my
note
.
<EOS>
You
have
it
in
your
hand
,
though
I
declare
during
these
two
hours
you
have
not
been
gracious
enough
to
read
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
about
the
Sabbath
-
school
and
the
children
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
anxious
I
am
to
have
them
here
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
learning
the
catechism
myself
,
on
purpose
.
<EOS>
You
must
manage
it
for
me
next
week
.
<EOS>
I
will
teach
them
,
at
any
rate
,
to
submit
themselves
to
their
spiritual
pastors
and
masters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
said
but
little
on
the
subject
of
Sabbath
-
schools
,
but
he
made
his
adieu
,
and
betook
himself
home
with
a
sad
heart
,
troubled
mind
,
and
uneasy
conscience
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
is
Entertained
by
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Grantly
at
Plumstead
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
remembered
that
Mr.
Slope
,
when
leaving
his
_
billet
-
doux
_
at
the
house
of
Mrs.
Bold
,
had
been
informed
that
it
would
be
sent
out
to
her
at
Plumstead
that
afternoon
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
and
Mr.
Harding
had
in
fact
come
into
town
together
in
the
brougham
,
and
it
had
been
arranged
that
they
should
call
for
Eleanor
's
parcels
as
they
left
on
their
way
home
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
they
did
so
call
,
and
the
maid
,
as
she
handed
to
the
coachman
a
small
basket
and
large
bundle
carefully
and
neatly
packed
,
gave
in
at
the
carriage
window
Mr.
Slope
's
epistle
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
,
who
was
sitting
next
to
the
window
,
took
it
and
immediately
recognized
the
hand
-
writing
of
his
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
left
this
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slope
called
with
it
himself
,
your
Reverence
,
"
said
the
girl
,
"
and
was
very
anxious
that
Missus
should
have
it
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
the
brougham
drove
off
,
and
the
letter
was
left
in
the
archdeacon
's
hand
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
it
as
though
he
held
a
basket
of
adders
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
thought
worse
of
the
document
had
he
read
it
and
discovered
it
to
be
licentious
and
atheistical
.
<EOS>
He
did
,
moreover
,
what
so
many
wise
people
are
accustomed
to
do
in
similar
circumstances
;
he
immediately
condemned
the
person
to
whom
the
letter
was
written
,
as
though
she
were
necessarily
a
_
particeps
criminis
_
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Harding
,
though
by
no
means
inclined
to
forward
Mr.
Slope
's
intimacy
with
his
daughter
,
would
have
given
anything
to
have
kept
the
letter
from
his
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
But
that
was
now
impossible
.
<EOS>
There
it
was
in
his
hand
,
and
he
looked
as
thoroughly
disgusted
as
though
he
were
quite
sure
that
it
contained
all
the
rhapsodies
of
a
favoured
lover
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
hard
on
me
,
"
said
he
after
awhile
,
"
that
this
should
go
on
under
my
roof
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
here
the
archdeacon
was
certainly
most
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
Having
invited
his
sister
-
in
-
law
to
his
house
,
it
was
a
natural
consequence
that
she
should
receive
her
letters
there
.
<EOS>
And
if
Mr.
Slope
chose
to
write
to
her
,
his
letter
would
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
be
sent
after
her
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
the
very
fact
of
an
invitation
to
one
's
house
implies
confidence
on
the
part
of
the
inviter
.
<EOS>
He
had
shown
that
he
thought
Mrs.
Bold
to
be
a
fit
person
to
stay
with
him
by
his
asking
her
to
do
so
,
and
it
was
most
cruel
to
her
that
he
should
complain
of
her
violating
the
sanctity
of
his
roof
-
tree
,
when
the
laches
committed
were
none
of
her
committing
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
felt
this
,
and
felt
also
that
when
the
archdeacon
talked
thus
about
his
roof
,
what
he
said
was
most
offensive
to
himself
as
Eleanor
's
father
.
<EOS>
If
Eleanor
did
receive
a
letter
from
Mr.
Slope
,
what
was
there
in
that
to
pollute
the
purity
of
Dr.
Grantly
's
household
?
<EOS>
He
was
indignant
that
his
daughter
should
be
so
judged
and
so
spoken
of
,
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
even
as
Mrs.
Slope
she
must
be
dearer
to
him
than
any
other
creature
on
God
's
earth
.
<EOS>
He
almost
broke
out
and
said
as
much
,
but
for
the
moment
he
restrained
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
handing
the
offensive
missile
to
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
"
I
am
not
going
to
be
the
bearer
of
his
love
-
letters
.
<EOS>
You
are
her
father
and
may
do
as
you
think
fit
with
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
By
doing
as
he
thought
fit
with
it
,
the
archdeacon
certainly
meant
that
Mr.
Harding
would
be
justified
in
opening
and
reading
the
letter
,
and
taking
any
steps
which
might
in
consequence
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
To
tell
the
truth
,
Dr.
Grantly
did
feel
rather
a
stronger
curiosity
than
was
justified
by
his
outraged
virtue
to
see
the
contents
of
the
letter
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
could
not
open
it
himself
,
but
he
wished
to
make
Mr.
Harding
understand
that
he
,
as
Eleanor
's
father
,
would
be
fully
justified
in
doing
so
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
such
a
proceeding
never
occurred
to
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
His
authority
over
Eleanor
ceased
when
she
became
the
wife
of
John
Bold
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
the
slightest
wish
to
pry
into
her
correspondence
.
<EOS>
He
consequently
put
the
letter
into
his
pocket
,
and
only
wished
that
he
had
been
able
to
do
so
without
the
archdeacon
's
knowledge
.
<EOS>
They
both
sat
silent
during
half
the
journey
home
,
and
then
Dr.
Grantly
said
,
"
Perhaps
Susan
had
better
give
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
can
explain
to
her
sister
better
than
either
you
or
I
can
do
how
deep
is
the
disgrace
of
such
an
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
are
very
hard
upon
Eleanor
,
"
replied
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
allow
that
she
has
disgraced
herself
,
nor
do
I
think
it
likely
that
she
will
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
has
a
right
to
correspond
with
whom
she
pleases
,
and
I
shall
not
take
upon
myself
to
blame
her
because
she
gets
a
letter
from
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
said
Dr.
Grantly
,
"
you
do
n't
wish
her
to
marry
the
man
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
'll
admit
that
she
would
disgrace
herself
if
she
did
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wish
her
to
marry
him
,
"
said
the
perplexed
father
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
him
,
and
do
not
think
he
would
make
a
good
husband
.
<EOS>
But
if
Eleanor
chooses
to
do
so
,
I
shall
certainly
not
think
that
she
disgraces
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
heavens
!
"
exclaimed
Dr.
Grantly
and
threw
himself
back
into
the
corner
of
his
brougham
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
said
nothing
more
,
but
commenced
playing
a
dirge
with
an
imaginary
fiddle
bow
upon
an
imaginary
violoncello
,
for
which
there
did
not
appear
to
be
quite
room
enough
in
the
carriage
;
he
continued
the
tune
,
with
sundry
variations
,
till
he
arrived
at
the
rectory
door
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
had
been
meditating
sad
things
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
had
always
looked
on
his
father
-
in
-
law
as
a
true
partisan
,
though
he
knew
him
to
be
a
man
devoid
of
all
the
combative
qualifications
for
that
character
.
<EOS>
He
had
felt
no
fear
that
Mr.
Harding
would
go
over
to
the
enemy
,
though
he
had
never
counted
much
on
the
ex
-
warden
's
prowess
in
breaking
the
hostile
ranks
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
it
seemed
that
Eleanor
,
with
her
wiles
,
had
completely
trepanned
and
bewildered
her
father
,
cheated
him
out
of
his
judgement
,
robbed
him
of
the
predilections
and
tastes
of
his
life
,
and
caused
him
to
be
tolerant
of
a
man
whose
arrogance
and
vulgarity
would
,
a
few
years
since
,
have
been
unendurable
to
him
.
<EOS>
That
the
whole
thing
was
as
good
as
arranged
between
Eleanor
and
Mr.
Slope
<EOS>
there
was
no
longer
any
room
to
doubt
.
<EOS>
That
Mr.
Harding
knew
that
such
was
the
case
,
even
this
could
hardly
be
doubted
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
manifest
that
he
at
any
rate
suspected
it
and
was
prepared
to
sanction
it
.
  
<EOS>
And
to
tell
the
truth
,
such
was
the
case
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
disliked
Mr.
Slope
as
much
as
it
was
in
his
nature
to
dislike
any
man
.
<EOS>
Had
his
daughter
wished
to
do
her
worst
to
displease
him
by
a
second
marriage
,
she
could
hardly
have
succeeded
better
than
by
marrying
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
he
said
to
himself
now
very
often
,
what
right
had
he
to
condemn
her
if
she
did
nothing
that
was
really
wrong
?
<EOS>
If
she
liked
Mr.
Slope
,
it
was
her
affair
.
<EOS>
It
was
indeed
miraculous
to
him
that
a
woman
with
such
a
mind
,
so
educated
,
so
refined
,
so
nice
in
her
tastes
,
should
like
such
a
man
.
<EOS>
Then
he
asked
himself
whether
it
was
possible
that
she
did
so
.
  
<EOS>
Ah
,
thou
weak
man
;
most
charitable
,
most
Christian
,
but
weakest
of
men
!
<EOS>
Why
could
n't
thou
not
have
asked
herself
?
<EOS>
Was
she
not
the
daughter
of
thy
loins
,
the
child
of
thy
heart
,
the
best
beloved
to
thee
of
all
humanity
?
<EOS>
Had
she
not
proved
to
thee
,
by
years
of
closest
affection
,
her
truth
and
goodness
and
filial
obedience
?
<EOS>
And
yet
,
knowing
and
feeling
all
this
,
thou
couldst
endure
to
go
groping
in
darkness
,
hearing
her
named
in
strains
which
wounded
thy
loving
heart
,
and
being
unable
to
defend
her
as
thou
shouldst
have
done
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
had
not
believed
,
did
not
believe
,
that
his
daughter
meant
to
marry
this
man
,
but
he
feared
to
commit
himself
to
such
an
opinion
.
<EOS>
If
she
did
do
it
there
would
be
then
no
means
of
retreat
.
<EOS>
The
wishes
of
his
heart
were
:
first
,
that
there
should
be
no
truth
in
the
archdeacon
's
surmises
;
and
in
this
wish
he
would
have
fain
trusted
entirely
,
had
he
dared
so
to
do
;
secondly
,
that
the
match
might
be
prevented
,
if
unfortunately
,
it
had
been
contemplated
by
Eleanor
;
thirdly
,
that
should
she
be
so
infatuated
as
to
marry
this
man
,
he
might
justify
his
conduct
and
declare
that
no
cause
existed
for
his
separating
himself
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
wanted
to
believe
her
incapable
of
such
a
marriage
;
he
wanted
to
show
that
he
so
believed
of
her
;
but
he
wanted
also
to
be
able
to
say
hereafter
that
she
had
done
nothing
amiss
,
if
she
should
unfortunately
prove
herself
to
be
different
from
what
he
thought
her
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
but
affection
could
justify
such
fickleness
,
but
affection
did
justify
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
but
little
of
the
Roman
about
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
sacrifice
his
Lucretia
even
though
she
should
be
polluted
by
the
accepted
addresses
of
the
clerical
Tarquin
at
the
palace
.
<EOS>
If
Tarquin
could
be
prevented
,
well
and
good
,
but
if
not
,
the
father
would
still
open
his
heart
to
his
daughter
and
accept
her
as
she
presented
herself
,
Tarquin
and
all
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
's
mind
was
of
a
stronger
calibre
,
and
he
was
by
no
means
deficient
in
heart
.
<EOS>
He
loved
with
an
honest
genuine
love
his
wife
and
children
and
friends
.
<EOS>
He
loved
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
and
was
quite
prepared
to
love
Eleanor
too
,
if
she
would
be
one
of
his
party
,
if
she
would
be
on
his
side
,
if
she
would
regard
the
Slopes
and
the
Proudies
as
the
enemies
of
mankind
and
acknowledge
and
feel
the
comfortable
merits
of
the
Gwynnes
and
Arabins
.
<EOS>
He
wished
to
be
what
he
called
"
safe
"
with
all
those
whom
he
had
admitted
to
the
penetralia
of
his
house
and
heart
.
<EOS>
He
could
luxuriate
in
no
society
that
was
deficient
in
a
certain
feeling
of
faithful
,
staunch
High
Churchism
,
which
to
him
was
tantamount
to
freemasonry
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
strict
in
his
lines
of
definition
.
<EOS>
He
endured
without
impatience
many
different
shades
of
Anglo
-
church
conservatism
;
but
with
the
Slopes
and
Proudies
he
could
not
go
on
all
fours
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
wanting
in
,
moreover
,
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
,
he
was
not
troubled
by
that
womanly
tenderness
which
was
so
peculiar
to
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
His
feelings
towards
his
friends
were
that
while
they
stuck
to
him
,
he
would
stick
to
them
;
that
he
would
work
with
them
shoulder
and
shoulder
;
that
he
would
be
faithful
to
the
faithful
.
<EOS>
He
knew
nothing
of
that
beautiful
love
which
can
be
true
to
a
false
friend
.
  
<EOS>
And
thus
these
two
men
,
each
miserable
enough
in
his
own
way
,
returned
to
Plumstead
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
getting
late
when
they
arrived
there
,
and
the
ladies
had
already
gone
up
to
dress
.
<EOS>
Nothing
more
was
said
as
the
two
parted
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
As
Mr.
Harding
passed
to
his
own
room
he
knocked
at
Eleanor
's
door
and
handed
in
the
letter
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
hurried
to
his
own
territory
,
there
to
unburden
his
heart
to
his
faithful
partner
.
  
<EOS>
What
colloquy
took
place
between
the
marital
chamber
and
the
adjoining
dressing
-
room
shall
not
be
detailed
.
<EOS>
The
reader
,
now
intimate
with
the
persons
concerned
,
can
well
imagine
it
.
<EOS>
The
whole
tenor
of
it
also
might
be
read
in
Mrs.
Grantly
's
brow
as
she
came
down
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
when
she
received
the
letter
from
her
father
's
hand
,
had
no
idea
from
whom
it
came
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
seen
Mr.
Slope
's
handwriting
,
or
if
so
had
forgotten
it
,
and
did
not
think
of
him
as
she
twisted
the
letter
as
people
do
twist
letters
when
they
do
not
immediately
recognize
their
correspondents
either
by
the
writing
or
the
seal
.
<EOS>
She
was
sitting
at
her
glass
,
brushing
her
hair
and
rising
every
other
minute
to
play
with
her
boy
,
who
was
sprawling
on
the
bed
and
who
engaged
pretty
nearly
the
whole
attention
of
the
maid
as
well
as
of
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
sitting
before
her
toilet
-
table
,
she
broke
the
seal
and
,
turning
over
the
leaf
,
saw
Mr.
Slope
's
name
.
<EOS>
She
first
felt
surprised
,
and
then
annoyed
,
and
then
anxious
.
<EOS>
As
she
read
it
she
became
interested
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
delighted
to
find
that
all
obstacles
to
her
father
's
return
to
the
hospital
were
apparently
removed
that
she
did
not
observe
the
fulsome
language
in
which
the
tidings
were
conveyed
.
<EOS>
She
merely
perceived
that
she
was
commissioned
to
tell
her
father
that
such
was
the
case
,
and
she
did
not
realize
the
fact
that
such
a
communication
should
not
have
been
made
,
in
the
first
instance
,
to
her
by
an
unmarried
young
clergyman
.
<EOS>
She
felt
,
on
the
whole
,
grateful
to
Mr.
Slope
and
anxious
to
get
on
her
dress
that
she
might
run
with
the
news
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
Then
she
came
to
the
allusion
to
her
own
pious
labours
,
and
she
said
in
her
heart
that
Mr.
Slope
was
an
affected
ass
.
<EOS>
Then
she
went
on
again
and
was
offended
by
her
boy
being
called
Mr.
Slope
's
darling
 
<EOS>
he
was
nobody
's
darling
but
her
own
,
or
at
any
rate
not
the
darling
of
a
disagreeable
stranger
like
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Lastly
she
arrived
at
the
tresses
and
felt
a
qualm
of
disgust
.
<EOS>
She
looked
up
in
the
glass
,
and
there
they
were
before
her
,
long
and
silken
,
certainly
,
and
very
beautiful
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
but
that
she
knew
them
to
be
so
,
but
she
felt
angry
with
them
and
brushed
them
roughly
and
carelessly
.
<EOS>
She
crumpled
the
letter
up
with
angry
violence
,
and
resolved
,
almost
without
thinking
of
it
,
that
she
would
not
show
it
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
She
would
merely
tell
him
the
contents
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
then
comforted
herself
again
with
her
boy
,
had
her
dress
fastened
,
and
went
down
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
tripped
down
the
stairs
she
began
to
ascertain
that
there
was
some
difficulty
in
her
situation
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
keep
from
her
father
the
news
about
the
hospital
,
nor
could
she
comfortably
confess
the
letter
from
Mr.
Slope
before
the
Grantlys
.
<EOS>
Her
father
had
already
gone
down
.
<EOS>
She
had
heard
his
step
upon
the
lobby
.
<EOS>
She
resolved
therefore
to
take
him
aside
and
tell
him
her
little
bit
of
news
.
<EOS>
Poor
girl
!
<EOS>
She
had
no
idea
how
severely
the
unfortunate
letter
had
already
been
discussed
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
entered
the
drawing
-
room
,
the
whole
party
were
there
,
including
Mr.
Arabin
,
and
the
whole
party
looked
glum
and
sour
.
<EOS>
The
two
girls
sat
silent
and
apart
as
though
they
were
aware
that
something
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
Even
Mr.
Arabin
was
solemn
and
silent
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
had
not
seen
him
since
breakfast
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
the
whole
day
at
St.
Ewold
's
,
and
such
having
been
the
case
,
it
was
natural
that
he
should
tell
how
matters
were
going
on
there
.
<EOS>
He
did
nothing
of
the
kind
,
however
,
but
remained
solemn
and
silent
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
solemn
and
silent
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
knew
in
her
heart
that
they
had
been
talking
about
her
,
and
her
heart
misgave
her
as
she
thought
of
Mr.
Slope
and
his
letter
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
she
felt
it
to
be
quite
impossible
to
speak
to
her
father
alone
while
matters
were
in
this
state
.
  
<EOS>
Dinner
was
soon
announced
,
and
Dr.
Grantly
,
as
was
his
wo
nt
,
gave
Eleanor
his
arm
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
so
as
though
the
doing
it
were
an
outrage
on
his
feelings
rendered
necessary
by
sternest
necessity
.
<EOS>
With
quick
sympathy
Eleanor
felt
this
,
and
hardly
put
her
fingers
on
his
coat
-
sleeve
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
guessed
in
what
way
the
dinner
-
hour
was
passed
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
said
a
few
words
to
Mr.
Arabin
,
Mr.
Arabin
said
a
few
words
to
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
,
she
said
a
few
words
to
her
father
,
and
he
tried
to
say
a
few
words
to
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
she
had
been
tried
and
found
guilty
of
something
,
though
she
knew
not
what
.
<EOS>
She
longed
to
say
out
to
them
all
,
"
Well
,
what
is
it
that
I
have
done
;
out
with
it
,
and
let
me
know
my
crime
;
for
heaven
's
sake
let
me
hear
the
worst
of
it
;
"
but
she
could
not
.
<EOS>
She
could
say
nothing
,
but
sat
there
silent
,
half
-
feeling
that
she
was
guilty
,
and
trying
in
vain
to
pretend
even
to
eat
her
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
the
cloth
was
drawn
,
and
the
ladies
were
not
long
following
it
.
<EOS>
When
they
were
gone
,
the
gentlemen
were
somewhat
more
sociable
but
not
much
so
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
of
course
talk
over
Eleanor
's
sins
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
had
indeed
so
far
betrayed
his
sister
-
in
-
law
as
to
whisper
into
Mr.
Arabin
's
ear
in
the
study
,
as
they
met
there
before
dinner
,
a
hint
of
what
he
feared
.
<EOS>
He
did
so
with
the
gravest
and
saddest
of
fears
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
became
grave
and
apparently
sad
enough
as
he
heard
it
.
<EOS>
He
opened
his
eyes
,
and
his
mouth
and
said
in
a
sort
of
whisper
"
Mr.
Slope
!
"
<EOS>
in
the
same
way
as
he
might
have
said
"
The
Cholera
!
"
had
his
friend
told
him
that
that
horrid
disease
was
in
his
nursery
.
<EOS>
"
I
fear
so
,
I
fear
so
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
and
then
together
they
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
We
will
not
accurately
analyse
Mr.
Arabin
's
feelings
on
receipt
of
such
astounding
tidings
.
<EOS>
It
will
suffice
to
say
that
he
was
surprised
,
vexed
,
sorrowful
,
and
ill
at
ease
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
perhaps
thought
very
much
about
Eleanor
,
but
he
had
appreciated
her
influence
,
and
had
felt
that
close
intimacy
with
her
in
a
country
-
house
was
pleasant
to
him
,
and
also
beneficial
.
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
highly
of
her
intelligence
to
the
archdeacon
,
and
had
walked
about
the
shrubberies
with
her
,
carrying
her
boy
on
his
back
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Arabin
had
called
Johnny
his
darling
,
Eleanor
was
not
angry
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
the
three
men
sat
over
their
wine
,
all
thinking
of
the
same
subject
,
but
unable
to
speak
of
it
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
So
we
will
leave
them
and
follow
the
ladies
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
had
received
a
commission
from
her
husband
,
and
had
undertaken
it
with
some
unwillingness
.
<EOS>
He
had
desired
her
to
speak
gravely
to
Eleanor
and
to
tell
her
that
,
if
she
persisted
in
her
adherence
to
Mr.
Slope
,
she
could
no
longer
look
for
the
countenance
of
her
present
friends
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
probably
knew
her
sister
better
than
the
doctor
did
,
and
assured
him
that
it
would
be
in
vain
to
talk
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
only
course
likely
to
be
of
any
service
in
her
opinion
was
to
keep
Eleanor
away
from
Barchester
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
might
have
added
,
for
she
had
a
very
keen
eye
in
such
things
,
that
there
might
also
be
ground
for
hope
in
keeping
Eleanor
near
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
Of
this
,
however
,
she
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
the
archdeacon
would
not
be
talked
over
;
he
spoke
much
of
his
conscience
,
and
declared
that
,
if
Mrs.
Grantly
would
not
do
it
,
he
would
.
<EOS>
So
instigated
,
the
lady
undertook
the
task
,
stating
,
however
,
her
full
conviction
that
her
interference
would
be
worse
than
useless
.
<EOS>
And
so
it
proved
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
were
in
the
drawing
-
room
Mrs.
Grantly
found
some
excuse
for
sending
her
girls
away
,
and
then
began
her
task
.
<EOS>
She
knew
well
that
she
could
exercise
but
very
slight
authority
over
her
sister
.
<EOS>
Their
various
modes
of
life
,
and
the
distance
between
their
residences
,
had
prevented
any
very
close
confidence
.
<EOS>
They
had
hardly
lived
together
since
Eleanor
was
a
child
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
had
,
moreover
,
especially
in
latter
years
,
resented
in
a
quiet
sort
of
way
the
dictatorial
authority
which
the
archdeacon
seemed
to
exercise
over
her
father
,
and
on
this
account
had
been
unwilling
to
allow
the
archdeacon
's
wife
to
exercise
authority
over
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
got
a
note
just
before
dinner
,
I
believe
,
"
began
the
eldest
sister
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
acknowledged
that
she
had
done
so
,
and
felt
that
she
turned
red
as
she
acknowledged
it
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
given
anything
to
have
kept
her
colour
,
but
the
more
she
tried
to
do
so
the
more
signally
she
failed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
not
from
Mr.
Slope
?
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
said
that
the
letter
was
from
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
a
regular
correspondent
of
yours
,
Eleanor
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
exactly
,
"
said
she
,
already
beginning
to
feel
angry
at
the
cross
-
examination
.
<EOS>
She
determined
,
and
why
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
,
that
nothing
should
induce
her
to
tell
her
sister
Susan
<EOS>
what
was
the
subject
of
the
letter
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
,
she
knew
,
was
instigated
by
the
archdeacon
,
and
she
would
not
plead
to
any
arraignment
made
against
her
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Eleanor
dear
,
why
do
you
get
letters
from
Mr.
Slope
at
all
,
knowing
,
<EOS>
as
you
do
,
he
is
a
person
so
distasteful
to
Papa
,
and
to
the
archdeacon
,
and
indeed
to
all
your
friends
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
first
place
,
Susan
,
I
do
n't
get
letters
from
him
;
and
in
the
next
place
,
as
Mr.
Slope
wrote
the
one
letter
which
I
have
got
,
and
as
I
only
received
it
,
which
I
could
not
very
well
help
doing
,
as
Papa
handed
it
to
me
,
I
think
you
had
better
ask
Mr.
Slope
instead
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
was
his
letter
about
,
Eleanor
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
you
,
"
said
she
,
"
because
it
was
confidential
.
<EOS>
It
was
on
business
respecting
a
third
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
in
no
way
personal
to
yourself
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
exactly
say
that
,
Susan
,
"
said
she
,
getting
more
and
more
angry
at
her
sister
's
questions
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
must
say
it
's
rather
singular
,
"
said
Mrs.
Grantly
,
affecting
to
laugh
,
"
that
a
young
lady
in
your
position
should
receive
a
letter
from
an
unmarried
gentleman
of
which
she
will
not
tell
the
contents
and
which
she
is
ashamed
to
show
to
her
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
ashamed
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
blazing
up
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
ashamed
of
anything
in
the
matter
;
only
I
do
not
choose
to
be
cross
-
examined
as
to
my
letters
by
anyone
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
dear
,
"
said
the
other
,
"
I
can
not
but
tell
you
that
I
do
not
think
Mr.
Slope
a
proper
correspondent
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
be
ever
so
improper
,
how
can
I
help
his
having
written
to
me
?
<EOS>
But
you
are
all
prejudiced
against
him
to
such
an
extent
that
that
which
would
be
kind
and
generous
in
another
man
is
odious
and
impudent
in
him
.
<EOS>
I
hate
a
religion
that
teaches
one
to
be
so
one
-
sided
in
one
's
charity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
,
Eleanor
,
that
you
hate
the
religion
you
find
here
,
but
surely
you
should
remember
that
in
such
matters
the
archdeacon
must
know
more
of
the
world
than
you
do
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
ask
you
to
respect
or
comply
with
me
,
although
I
am
,
unfortunately
,
so
many
years
your
senior
;
but
surely
,
in
such
a
matter
as
this
,
you
might
consent
to
be
guided
by
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
He
is
most
anxious
to
be
your
friend
,
if
you
will
let
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
such
a
matter
as
what
?
"
said
Eleanor
very
testily
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
I
do
n't
know
what
this
is
all
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
all
want
you
to
drop
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
all
want
me
to
be
as
illiberal
as
yourselves
.
<EOS>
That
I
shall
never
be
.
<EOS>
I
see
no
harm
in
Mr.
Slope
's
acquaintance
,
and
I
shall
not
insult
the
man
by
telling
him
that
I
do
.
<EOS>
He
has
thought
it
necessary
to
write
to
me
,
and
I
do
not
want
the
archdeacon
's
advice
about
the
letter
.
<EOS>
If
I
did
,
I
would
ask
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Eleanor
,
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
you
,
"
and
now
she
spoke
with
a
tremendous
gravity
,
"
that
the
archdeacon
thinks
that
such
a
correspondence
is
disgraceful
,
and
that
he
can
not
allow
it
to
go
on
in
his
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
's
eyes
flashed
fire
as
she
answered
her
sister
,
jumping
up
from
her
seat
as
she
did
so
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
tell
the
archdeacon
that
wherever
I
am
I
shall
receive
what
letters
I
please
and
from
whom
I
please
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
the
word
"
disgraceful
,
"
if
Dr.
Grantly
has
used
it
of
me
,
he
has
been
unmanly
and
inhospitable
,
"
and
she
walked
off
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
When
Papa
comes
from
the
dining
-
room
I
will
thank
you
to
ask
him
to
step
up
to
my
bedroom
.
<EOS>
I
will
show
him
Mr.
Slope
's
letter
,
but
I
will
show
it
to
no
one
else
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
saying
,
she
retreated
to
her
baby
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
no
conception
of
the
crime
with
which
she
was
charged
.
<EOS>
The
idea
that
she
could
be
thought
by
her
friends
to
regard
Mr.
Slope
as
a
lover
had
never
flashed
upon
her
.
<EOS>
She
conceived
that
they
were
all
prejudiced
and
illiberal
in
their
persecution
of
him
,
and
therefore
she
would
not
join
in
the
persecution
,
even
though
she
greatly
disliked
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
was
very
angry
as
she
seated
herself
in
a
low
chair
by
her
open
window
at
the
foot
of
her
child
's
bed
.
"
<EOS>
To
dare
to
say
I
have
disgraced
myself
,
"
she
repeated
to
herself
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
Papa
can
put
up
with
that
man
's
arrogance
!
<EOS>
I
will
certainly
not
sit
down
to
dinner
in
his
house
again
unless
he
begs
my
pardon
for
that
word
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
a
thought
struck
her
that
Mr.
Arabin
might
perchance
hear
of
her
"
disgraceful
"
correspondence
with
Mr.
Slope
,
and
she
turned
crimson
with
pure
vexation
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
she
had
known
the
truth
!
<EOS>
If
she
could
have
conceived
that
Mr.
Arabin
had
been
informed
as
a
fact
that
she
was
going
to
marry
Mr.
Slope
!
  
<EOS>
She
had
not
been
long
in
her
room
before
her
father
joined
her
.
<EOS>
As
he
left
the
drawing
-
room
Mrs.
Grantly
took
her
husband
into
the
recess
of
the
window
and
told
him
how
signally
she
had
failed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
speak
to
her
myself
before
I
go
to
bed
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
no
such
thing
,
"
said
she
;
"
you
can
do
no
good
and
will
only
make
an
unseemly
quarrel
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
idea
how
headstrong
she
can
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
declared
that
as
to
that
he
was
quite
indifferent
.
<EOS>
He
knew
his
duty
and
would
do
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
was
weak
in
the
extreme
in
such
matters
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
have
it
hereafter
on
his
conscience
that
he
had
not
done
all
that
in
him
lay
to
prevent
so
disgraceful
an
alliance
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
that
Mrs.
Grantly
assured
him
that
speaking
to
Eleanor
angrily
would
only
hasten
such
a
crisis
and
render
it
certain
,
if
at
present
there
were
any
doubt
.
<EOS>
He
was
angry
,
self
-
willed
,
and
sore
.
<EOS>
The
fact
that
a
lady
of
his
household
had
received
a
letter
from
Mr.
Slope
had
wounded
his
pride
in
the
sorest
place
,
and
nothing
could
control
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
looked
worn
and
woe
-
begone
as
he
entered
his
daughter
's
room
.
<EOS>
These
sorrows
worried
him
sadly
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
if
they
were
continued
,
he
must
go
to
the
wall
in
the
manner
so
kindly
prophesied
to
him
by
the
chaplain
.
<EOS>
He
knocked
gently
at
his
daughter
's
door
,
waited
till
he
was
distinctly
bade
to
enter
,
and
then
appeared
as
though
he
and
not
she
were
the
suspected
criminal
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
's
arm
was
soon
within
his
,
and
she
had
soon
kissed
his
forehead
and
caressed
him
,
not
with
joyous
but
with
eager
love
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Papa
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
do
so
want
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
They
have
been
talking
about
me
downstairs
to
-
night
 
<EOS>
do
n't
you
know
they
have
,
Papa
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
confessed
with
a
sort
of
murmur
that
the
archdeacon
had
been
speaking
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
hate
Dr.
Grantly
soon
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
shall
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
He
is
so
uncharitable
,
so
unkind
,
so
suspicious
of
everyone
that
does
not
worship
himself
:
<EOS>
and
then
he
is
so
monstrously
arrogant
to
other
people
who
have
a
right
to
their
opinions
as
well
as
he
has
to
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
an
earnest
,
eager
man
,
my
dear
,
but
he
never
means
to
be
unkind
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
unkind
,
Papa
,
most
unkind
.
<EOS>
There
,
I
got
that
letter
from
Mr.
Slope
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
It
was
you
yourself
who
gave
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
There
,
pray
read
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
for
you
.
<EOS>
It
should
have
been
addressed
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
they
have
been
talking
about
it
downstairs
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
they
behaved
to
me
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
And
since
dinner
Susan
has
been
preaching
to
me
,
till
I
could
not
remain
in
the
room
with
her
.
<EOS>
Read
it
,
Papa
,
and
then
say
whether
that
is
a
letter
that
need
make
Dr.
Grantly
so
outrageous
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
took
his
arm
from
his
daughter
's
waist
and
slowly
read
the
letter
.
<EOS>
She
expected
to
see
his
countenance
lit
with
joy
as
he
learnt
that
his
path
back
to
the
hospital
was
made
so
smooth
;
but
she
was
doomed
to
disappointment
,
as
had
once
been
the
case
before
on
a
somewhat
similar
occasion
.
<EOS>
His
first
feeling
was
one
of
unmitigated
disgust
that
Mr.
Slope
should
have
chosen
to
interfere
in
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
anxious
to
get
back
to
the
hospital
,
but
he
would
have
infinitely
sooner
resigned
all
pretensions
to
the
place
than
have
owed
it
in
any
manner
to
Mr.
Slope
's
influence
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
Then
he
thoroughly
disliked
the
tone
of
Mr.
Slope
's
letter
;
it
was
unctuous
,
false
,
and
unwholesome
,
like
the
man
.
<EOS>
He
saw
,
which
Eleanor
had
failed
to
see
,
that
much
more
had
been
intended
than
was
expressed
.
<EOS>
The
appeal
to
Eleanor
's
pious
labours
as
separate
from
his
own
grated
sadly
against
his
feelings
as
a
father
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
when
he
came
to
the
"
darling
boy
"
and
the
"
silken
tresses
,
"
he
slowly
closed
and
folded
the
letter
in
despair
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
that
Mr.
Slope
should
so
write
unless
he
had
been
encouraged
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
Eleanor
should
have
received
such
a
letter
,
and
have
received
it
without
annoyance
,
unless
she
were
willing
to
encourage
him
.
<EOS>
So
at
least
Mr.
Harding
argued
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
How
hard
it
is
to
judge
accurately
of
the
feelings
of
others
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
,
as
he
came
to
the
close
of
the
letter
,
in
his
heart
condemned
his
daughter
for
indelicacy
,
and
it
made
him
miserable
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
responsible
for
what
Mr.
Slope
might
write
.
<EOS>
True
.
<EOS>
But
then
she
expressed
no
disgust
at
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
rather
expressed
approval
of
the
letter
as
a
whole
.
<EOS>
She
had
given
it
to
him
to
read
,
as
a
vindication
for
herself
and
also
for
him
.
<EOS>
The
father
's
spirits
sank
within
him
as
he
felt
that
he
could
not
acquit
her
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
it
was
the
true
feminine
delicacy
of
Eleanor
's
mind
which
brought
on
her
this
condemnation
.
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
,
ladies
,
and
I
beseech
you
to
acquit
her
.
<EOS>
She
thought
of
this
man
,
this
lover
of
whom
she
was
so
unconscious
,
exactly
as
her
father
did
,
exactly
as
the
Grantlys
did
.
<EOS>
At
least
she
esteemed
him
personally
as
they
did
.
<EOS>
But
she
believed
him
to
be
in
the
main
an
honest
man
,
and
one
truly
inclined
to
assist
her
father
.
<EOS>
She
felt
herself
bound
,
after
what
had
passed
,
to
show
this
letter
to
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
She
thought
it
necessary
that
he
should
know
what
Mr.
Slope
had
to
say
.
<EOS>
But
she
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
apologize
for
,
or
condemn
,
or
even
allude
to
the
vulgarity
of
the
man
's
tone
,
which
arose
,
as
does
all
vulgarity
,
from
ignorance
.
<EOS>
It
was
nauseous
to
her
to
have
a
man
like
Mr.
Slope
commenting
on
her
personal
attractions
,
and
she
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
dilate
with
her
father
upon
what
was
nauseous
.
<EOS>
She
never
supposed
they
could
disagree
on
such
a
subject
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
painful
for
her
to
point
it
out
,
painful
for
her
to
speak
strongly
against
a
man
of
whom
,
on
the
whole
,
she
was
anxious
to
think
and
speak
well
.
<EOS>
In
encountering
such
a
man
she
had
encountered
what
was
disagreeable
,
as
she
might
do
in
walking
the
streets
.
<EOS>
But
in
such
encounters
she
never
thought
it
necessary
to
dwell
on
what
disgusted
her
.
  
<EOS>
And
he
,
foolish
,
weak
,
loving
man
,
would
not
say
one
word
,
though
one
word
would
have
cleared
up
everything
.
<EOS>
There
would
have
been
a
deluge
of
tears
,
and
in
ten
minutes
everyone
in
the
house
would
have
understood
how
matters
really
were
.
<EOS>
The
father
would
have
been
delighted
.
<EOS>
The
sister
would
have
kissed
her
sister
and
begged
a
thousand
pardons
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
would
have
apologized
and
wondered
,
and
raised
his
eyebrows
,
and
gone
to
bed
a
happy
man
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Arabin
 
Mr.
Arabin
would
have
dreamt
of
Eleanor
,
have
awoke
in
the
morning
with
ideas
of
love
,
and
retired
to
rest
the
next
evening
with
schemes
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
But
,
alas
,
all
this
was
not
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
slowly
folded
the
letter
,
handed
it
back
to
her
,
kissed
her
forehead
,
and
bade
God
bless
her
.
<EOS>
He
then
crept
slowly
away
to
his
own
room
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
had
left
the
passage
,
another
knock
was
given
at
Eleanor
's
door
,
and
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
's
very
demure
own
maid
,
entering
on
tiptoe
,
wanted
to
know
would
Mrs.
Bold
be
so
kind
as
to
speak
to
the
archdeacon
for
two
minutes
in
the
archdeacon
's
study
,
if
not
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
's
compliments
,
and
he
would
n't
detain
her
two
minutes
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
thought
it
was
very
disagreeable
;
she
was
tired
and
fagged
and
sick
at
heart
;
her
present
feelings
towards
Dr.
Grantly
were
anything
but
those
of
affection
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
however
,
no
coward
,
and
therefore
promised
to
be
in
the
study
in
five
minutes
.
<EOS>
So
she
arranged
her
hair
,
tied
on
her
cap
,
and
went
down
with
a
palpitating
heart
.
   
<EOS>
A
Serious
Interview
 
<EOS>
There
are
people
who
delight
in
serious
interviews
,
especially
when
to
them
appertains
the
part
of
offering
advice
or
administering
rebuke
,
and
perhaps
the
archdeacon
was
one
of
these
.
<EOS>
Yet
on
this
occasion
he
did
not
prepare
himself
for
the
coming
conversation
with
much
anticipation
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Whatever
might
be
his
faults
he
was
not
an
inhospitable
man
,
and
he
almost
felt
that
he
was
sinning
against
hospitality
in
upbraiding
Eleanor
in
his
own
house
.
<EOS>
Then
,
also
,
he
was
not
quite
sure
that
he
would
get
the
best
of
it
.
<EOS>
His
wife
had
told
him
that
he
decidedly
would
not
,
and
he
usually
gave
credit
to
what
his
wife
said
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
however
,
so
convinced
of
what
he
considered
to
be
the
impropriety
of
Eleanor
's
conduct
,
and
so
assured
also
of
his
own
duty
in
trying
to
check
it
,
that
his
conscience
would
not
allow
him
to
take
his
wife
's
advice
and
go
to
bed
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
's
face
as
she
entered
the
room
was
not
such
as
to
reassure
him
.
<EOS>
As
a
rule
she
was
always
mild
in
manner
and
gentle
in
conduct
;
but
there
was
that
in
her
eye
which
made
it
not
an
easy
task
to
scold
her
.
<EOS>
In
truth
she
had
been
little
used
to
scolding
.
<EOS>
No
one
since
her
childhood
had
tried
it
but
the
archdeacon
,
and
he
had
generally
failed
when
he
did
try
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
done
so
since
her
marriage
;
and
now
,
when
he
saw
her
quiet
,
easy
step
as
she
entered
his
room
,
he
almost
wished
that
he
had
taken
his
wife
's
advice
.
  
<EOS>
He
began
by
apologizing
for
the
trouble
he
was
giving
her
.
<EOS>
She
begged
him
not
to
mention
it
,
assured
him
that
walking
downstairs
was
no
trouble
to
her
at
all
,
and
then
took
a
seat
and
waited
patiently
for
him
to
begin
his
attack
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Eleanor
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
hope
you
believe
me
when
I
assure
you
that
you
have
no
sincerer
friend
than
I
am
.
"
<EOS>
To
this
Eleanor
answered
nothing
,
and
therefore
he
proceeded
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
a
brother
of
your
own
,
I
should
not
probably
trouble
you
with
what
I
am
going
to
say
.
<EOS>
But
as
it
is
I
can
not
but
think
that
it
must
be
a
comfort
to
you
to
know
that
you
have
near
you
one
who
is
as
anxious
for
your
welfare
as
any
brother
of
your
own
could
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
had
a
brother
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
never
had
,
and
it
is
therefore
that
I
speak
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
had
a
brother
,
"
she
repeated
,
"
but
I
have
hardly
felt
the
want
.
<EOS>
Papa
has
been
to
me
both
father
and
brother
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
father
is
the
fondest
and
most
affectionate
of
men
.
<EOS>
But
 
"
  
"
He
is
 
the
fondest
and
most
affectionate
of
men
,
and
the
best
of
counsellors
.
<EOS>
While
he
lives
I
can
never
want
advice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
rather
put
the
archdeacon
out
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
exactly
contradict
what
his
sister
-
in
-
law
said
about
her
father
,
and
yet
he
did
not
at
all
agree
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
her
to
understand
that
he
tendered
his
assistance
because
her
father
was
a
soft
,
good
-
natured
gentleman
not
sufficiently
knowing
in
the
ways
of
the
world
;
but
he
could
not
say
this
to
her
.
<EOS>
So
he
had
to
rush
into
the
subject
-
matter
of
his
proffered
counsel
without
any
acknowledgement
on
her
part
that
she
could
need
it
,
or
would
be
grateful
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Susan
tells
me
that
you
received
a
letter
this
evening
from
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
Papa
brought
it
in
the
brougham
.
<EOS>
Did
he
not
tell
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
Susan
says
that
you
objected
to
let
her
know
what
it
was
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
she
asked
me
.
<EOS>
But
had
she
done
so
,
I
should
not
have
told
her
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
it
nice
to
be
asked
about
one
's
letters
.
<EOS>
If
one
wishes
to
show
them
,
one
does
so
without
being
asked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
True
.
<EOS>
Quite
so
.
<EOS>
What
you
say
is
quite
true
.
<EOS>
But
is
not
the
fact
of
your
receiving
letters
from
Mr.
Slope
,
which
you
do
not
wish
to
show
to
your
friends
,
a
circumstance
which
must
excite
some
 
some
surprise
 
<EOS>
some
suspicion
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Suspicion
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
not
speaking
above
her
usual
voice
,
speaking
still
in
a
soft
,
womanly
tone
but
yet
with
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
Suspicion
!
<EOS>
And
who
suspects
me
,
and
of
what
?
"
<EOS>
And
then
there
was
a
pause
,
for
the
archdeacon
<EOS>
was
not
quite
ready
to
explain
the
ground
of
his
suspicion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
Dr.
Grantly
,
I
did
not
choose
to
show
Mr.
Slope
's
letter
to
Susan
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
show
it
to
anyone
till
Papa
had
seen
it
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
wish
to
read
it
now
,
you
can
do
so
,
"
and
she
handed
the
letter
to
him
over
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
an
amount
of
compliance
which
he
had
not
at
all
expected
,
and
which
rather
upset
him
in
his
tactics
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
took
the
letter
,
perused
it
carefully
,
and
then
refolding
it
,
kept
it
on
the
table
under
his
hand
.
<EOS>
To
him
it
appeared
to
be
in
almost
every
respect
the
letter
of
a
declared
lover
;
it
seemed
to
corroborate
his
worst
suspicions
;
and
the
fact
of
Eleanor
's
showing
it
to
him
was
all
but
tantamount
to
a
declaration
on
her
part
that
it
was
her
pleasure
to
receive
love
-
letters
from
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
He
almost
entirely
overlooked
the
real
subject
-
matter
of
the
epistle
,
so
intent
was
he
on
the
forthcoming
courtship
and
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
thank
you
to
give
it
me
back
,
if
you
please
,
Dr.
Grantly
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
it
in
his
hand
and
held
it
up
,
but
made
no
immediate
overture
to
return
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Harding
has
seen
this
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
has
,
"
said
she
;
"
it
was
written
that
he
might
see
it
.
<EOS>
It
refers
solely
to
his
business
 
of
course
I
showed
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
,
Eleanor
,
do
you
think
that
that
is
a
proper
letter
for
you
 
for
a
person
in
your
condition
 
to
receive
from
Mr.
Slope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
a
proper
letter
,
"
said
she
,
speaking
,
perhaps
,
a
little
out
of
obstinacy
,
probably
forgetting
at
the
moment
the
objectionable
mention
of
her
silken
curls
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Eleanor
,
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
I
wholly
differ
from
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
suppose
,
"
said
she
,
instigated
now
by
sheer
opposition
and
determination
not
to
succumb
.
<EOS>
"
You
think
Mr.
Slope
is
a
messenger
direct
from
Satan
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
is
an
industrious
,
well
-
meaning
clergyman
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
pity
that
we
differ
as
we
do
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
we
do
differ
,
we
had
probably
better
not
talk
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Eleanor
undoubtedly
put
herself
in
the
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
might
probably
have
refused
to
talk
to
Dr.
Grantly
on
the
matter
in
dispute
without
any
impropriety
,
but
,
having
consented
to
listen
to
him
,
she
had
no
business
to
tell
him
that
he
regarded
Mr.
Slope
as
an
emissary
from
the
evil
one
;
nor
was
she
justified
in
praising
Mr.
Slope
,
seeing
that
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
did
not
think
well
of
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
however
,
wounded
in
spirit
,
and
angry
,
and
bitter
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
subjected
to
contumely
and
cross
-
questioning
and
ill
-
usage
through
the
whole
evening
.
<EOS>
No
one
,
not
even
Mr.
Arabin
,
not
even
her
father
,
had
been
kind
to
her
.
<EOS>
All
this
she
attributed
to
the
prejudice
and
conceit
of
the
archdeacon
,
and
therefore
she
resolved
to
set
no
bounds
to
her
antagonism
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
would
neither
give
nor
take
quarter
.
<EOS>
He
had
greatly
presumed
in
daring
to
question
her
about
her
correspondence
,
and
she
was
determined
to
show
that
she
thought
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
,
you
are
forgetting
yourself
,
"
said
he
,
looking
very
sternly
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Otherwise
you
would
never
tell
me
that
I
conceive
any
man
to
be
a
messenger
from
Satan
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
is
too
bad
for
him
.
<EOS>
Give
me
that
letter
,
if
you
please
;
"
and
she
stretched
out
her
hand
and
took
it
from
him
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
been
doing
his
best
to
serve
Papa
,
doing
more
than
any
of
Papa
's
friends
could
do
;
and
yet
,
because
he
is
the
chaplain
of
a
bishop
whom
you
do
n't
like
,
you
speak
of
him
as
though
he
had
no
right
to
the
usage
of
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
done
nothing
for
your
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
that
he
has
done
a
great
deal
;
and
,
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
I
am
grateful
to
him
.
<EOS>
Nothing
that
you
can
say
can
prevent
my
being
so
.
<EOS>
I
judge
people
by
their
acts
,
and
his
,
as
far
as
I
can
see
them
,
are
good
.
"
<EOS>
She
then
paused
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
nothing
further
to
say
,
I
shall
be
obliged
by
being
permitted
to
say
good
night
 
I
am
very
tired
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
had
,
as
he
thought
,
done
his
best
to
be
gracious
to
his
sister
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
He
had
endeavoured
not
to
be
harsh
to
her
,
and
had
striven
to
pluck
the
sting
from
his
rebuke
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
intend
that
she
should
leave
him
without
hearing
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
something
to
say
,
Eleanor
,
and
I
fear
I
must
trouble
you
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
You
profess
that
it
is
quite
proper
that
you
should
receive
from
Mr.
Slope
such
letters
as
that
you
have
in
your
hand
.
<EOS>
Susan
and
I
think
very
differently
.
<EOS>
You
are
,
of
course
,
your
own
mistress
,
and
much
as
we
both
must
grieve
should
anything
separate
you
from
us
,
we
have
no
power
to
prevent
you
from
taking
steps
which
may
lead
to
such
a
separation
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
so
wilful
as
to
reject
the
counsel
of
your
friends
,
you
must
be
allowed
to
cater
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
But
,
Eleanor
,
I
may
at
any
rate
ask
you
this
.
<EOS>
Is
it
worth
your
while
to
break
away
from
all
those
you
have
loved
 
from
all
who
love
you
 
for
the
sake
of
Mr.
Slope
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
,
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
<EOS>
;
I
do
n't
know
what
you
're
talking
about
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
break
away
from
anybody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
do
so
if
you
connect
yourself
with
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
I
must
speak
out
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
choose
between
your
sister
and
myself
and
our
friends
,
and
Mr.
Slope
and
his
friends
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
of
your
father
,
as
you
may
probably
understand
his
feelings
better
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
Dr.
Grantly
?
<EOS>
What
am
I
to
understand
?
<EOS>
I
never
heard
such
wicked
prejudice
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
no
prejudice
,
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
I
have
known
the
world
longer
than
you
have
done
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
is
altogether
beneath
you
.
<EOS>
You
ought
to
know
and
feel
that
he
is
so
.
<EOS>
Pray
 
pray
think
of
this
before
it
is
too
late
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Too
late
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Or
if
you
will
not
believe
me
,
ask
Susan
;
you
can
not
think
she
is
prejudiced
against
you
.
<EOS>
Or
even
consult
your
father
 
<EOS>
he
is
not
prejudiced
against
you
.
<EOS>
Ask
Mr.
Arabin
 
"
  
"
You
have
n't
spoken
to
Mr.
Arabin
about
this
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
jumping
up
and
standing
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
,
all
the
world
in
and
about
Barchester
will
be
speaking
of
it
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
have
you
spoken
to
Mr.
Arabin
about
me
and
Mr.
Slope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
have
,
and
he
quite
agrees
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Agrees
with
what
?
<EOS>
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
are
trying
to
drive
me
mad
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
agrees
with
me
and
Susan
that
it
is
quite
impossible
you
should
be
received
at
Plumstead
as
Mrs.
Slope
.
"
  
<EOS>
Not
being
favourites
with
the
tragic
muse
,
we
do
not
dare
to
attempt
any
description
of
Eleanor
's
face
when
she
first
heard
the
name
of
Mrs.
Slope
pronounced
as
that
which
would
or
should
or
might
at
some
time
appertain
to
herself
.
<EOS>
The
look
,
such
as
it
was
,
Dr.
Grantly
did
not
soon
forget
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
or
two
she
could
find
no
words
to
express
her
deep
anger
and
deep
disgust
;
indeed
,
at
this
conjuncture
,
words
did
not
come
to
her
very
freely
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
be
so
impertinent
?
<EOS>
"
at
last
she
said
,
and
then
she
hurried
out
of
the
room
without
giving
the
archdeacon
the
opportunity
of
uttering
another
word
.
<EOS>
It
was
with
difficulty
she
contained
herself
till
she
reached
her
own
room
;
and
then
,
locking
the
door
,
she
threw
herself
on
her
bed
and
sobbed
as
though
her
heart
would
break
.
  
<EOS>
But
even
yet
she
had
no
conception
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
idea
that
her
father
and
her
sister
had
for
days
past
conceived
in
sober
earnest
the
idea
that
she
was
going
to
marry
this
man
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
even
then
believe
that
the
archdeacon
thought
that
she
would
do
so
.
<EOS>
By
some
manoeuvre
of
her
brain
she
attributed
the
origin
of
the
accusation
to
Mr.
Arabin
,
and
as
she
did
so
her
anger
against
him
was
excessive
,
and
the
vexation
of
her
spirit
almost
unendurable
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
think
that
the
charge
was
made
seriously
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
to
her
most
probable
that
the
archdeacon
and
Mr.
Arabin
had
talked
over
her
objectionable
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Slope
;
that
Mr.
Arabin
in
his
jeering
,
sarcastic
way
had
suggested
the
odious
match
as
being
the
severest
way
of
treating
with
contumely
her
acquaintance
with
his
enemy
;
and
that
the
archdeacon
,
taking
the
idea
from
him
,
thought
proper
to
punish
her
by
the
allusion
.
<EOS>
The
whole
night
she
lay
awake
thinking
of
what
had
been
said
,
and
this
appeared
to
be
the
most
probable
solution
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
reflexion
that
Mr.
Arabin
should
have
in
any
way
mentioned
her
name
in
connexion
with
that
of
Mr.
Slope
was
overpowering
;
and
the
spiteful
ill
-
nature
of
the
archdeacon
in
repeating
the
charge
to
her
made
her
wish
to
leave
his
house
almost
before
the
day
had
broken
.
<EOS>
One
thing
was
certain
:
nothing
should
make
her
stay
there
beyond
the
following
morning
,
and
nothing
should
make
her
sit
down
to
breakfast
in
company
with
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
When
she
thought
of
the
man
whose
name
had
been
linked
with
her
own
,
she
cried
from
sheer
disgust
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
because
she
would
be
thus
disgusted
,
thus
pained
and
shocked
and
cut
to
the
quick
,
that
the
archdeacon
had
spoken
the
horrid
word
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
to
make
her
quarrel
with
Mr.
Slope
,
and
therefore
he
had
outraged
her
by
his
abominable
vulgarity
.
<EOS>
She
determined
that
at
any
rate
he
should
know
that
she
appreciated
it
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
was
the
archdeacon
a
bit
better
satisfied
with
the
result
of
his
serious
interview
than
was
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
He
gathered
from
it
,
as
indeed
he
could
hardly
fail
to
do
,
that
she
was
very
angry
with
him
,
but
he
thought
that
she
was
thus
angry
,
not
because
she
was
suspected
of
an
intention
to
marry
Mr.
Slope
,
but
because
such
an
intention
was
imputed
to
her
as
a
crime
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
regarded
this
supposed
union
with
disgust
,
but
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
Eleanor
was
outraged
because
she
looked
at
it
exactly
in
the
same
light
.
  
<EOS>
He
returned
to
his
wife
,
vexed
and
somewhat
disconsolate
,
but
nevertheless
confirmed
in
his
wrath
against
his
sister
-
in
-
law
.
"
<EOS>
Her
whole
behaviour
,
"
said
he
,
"
has
been
most
objectionable
.
<EOS>
She
handed
me
his
love
-
letter
to
read
as
though
she
were
proud
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
she
is
proud
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
is
proud
of
having
this
slavering
,
greedy
man
at
her
feet
.
<EOS>
She
will
throw
herself
and
John
Bold
's
money
into
his
lap
;
she
will
ruin
her
boy
,
disgrace
her
father
and
you
,
and
be
a
wretched
miserable
woman
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
spouse
,
who
was
sitting
at
her
toilet
-
table
,
continued
her
avocations
,
making
no
answer
to
all
this
.
<EOS>
She
had
known
that
the
archdeacon
would
gain
nothing
by
interfering
,
but
she
was
too
charitable
to
provoke
him
by
saying
so
while
he
was
in
such
deep
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
comes
of
a
man
making
such
a
will
as
that
of
Bold
's
,
"
he
continued
.
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
is
no
more
fitted
to
be
trusted
with
such
an
amount
of
money
in
her
own
hands
than
is
a
charity
-
school
girl
.
"
Still
Mrs.
Grantly
made
no
reply
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
have
done
my
duty
;
I
can
do
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
her
plainly
that
she
can
not
be
allowed
to
form
a
link
of
connexion
between
me
and
that
man
.
<EOS>
From
henceforward
it
will
not
be
in
my
power
to
make
her
welcome
at
Plumstead
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
have
Mr.
Slope
's
love
-
letters
coming
here
.
<EOS>
Susan
,
I
think
you
had
better
let
her
understand
that
,
as
her
mind
on
this
subject
seems
to
be
irrevocably
fixed
,
it
will
be
better
for
all
parties
that
she
should
return
to
Barchester
.
"
  
<EOS>
Now
Mrs.
Grantly
was
angry
with
Eleanor
 
nearly
as
angry
as
her
husband
 
<EOS>
but
she
had
no
idea
of
turning
her
sister
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
at
length
spoke
out
and
explained
to
the
archdeacon
in
her
own
mild
,
seducing
way
that
he
was
fuming
and
fussing
and
fretting
himself
very
unnecessarily
.
<EOS>
She
declared
that
things
,
if
left
alone
,
would
arrange
themselves
much
better
than
he
could
arrange
them
,
and
at
last
succeeded
in
inducing
him
to
go
to
bed
in
a
somewhat
less
inhospitable
state
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
Eleanor
's
maid
was
commissioned
to
send
word
into
the
dining
-
room
that
her
mistress
was
not
well
enough
to
attend
prayers
and
that
she
would
breakfast
in
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
Here
she
was
visited
by
her
father
,
and
declared
to
him
her
intention
of
returning
immediately
to
Barchester
.
<EOS>
He
was
hardly
surprised
by
the
announcement
.
<EOS>
All
the
household
seemed
to
be
aware
that
something
had
gone
wrong
.
<EOS>
Everyone
walked
about
with
subdued
feet
,
and
people
's
shoes
seemed
to
creak
more
than
usual
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
look
of
conscious
intelligence
on
the
faces
of
the
women
,
and
the
men
attempted
,
but
in
vain
,
to
converse
as
though
nothing
were
the
matter
.
<EOS>
All
this
had
weighed
heavily
on
the
heart
of
Mr.
Harding
,
and
when
Eleanor
told
him
that
her
immediate
return
to
Barchester
was
a
necessity
,
he
merely
sighed
piteously
and
said
that
he
would
be
ready
to
accompany
her
.
  
<EOS>
But
here
she
objected
strenuously
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
great
wish
,
she
said
,
to
go
alone
;
a
great
desire
that
it
might
be
seen
that
her
father
was
not
implicated
in
her
quarrel
with
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
To
this
at
last
he
gave
way
;
but
not
a
word
passed
between
them
about
Mr.
Slope
 
not
a
word
was
said
,
not
a
question
asked
as
to
the
serious
interview
on
the
preceding
evening
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
indeed
,
very
little
confidence
between
them
,
though
neither
of
them
knew
why
it
should
be
so
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
once
asked
him
whether
he
would
not
call
upon
the
bishop
,
but
he
answered
rather
tartly
that
he
did
not
know
 
<EOS>
he
did
not
think
he
should
,
but
he
could
not
say
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
And
so
they
parted
.
<EOS>
Each
was
miserably
anxious
for
some
show
of
affection
,
for
some
return
of
confidence
,
for
some
sign
of
the
feeling
that
usually
bound
them
together
.
<EOS>
But
none
was
given
.
<EOS>
The
father
could
not
bring
himself
to
question
his
daughter
about
her
supposed
lover
,
and
the
daughter
would
not
sully
her
mouth
by
repeating
the
odious
word
with
which
Dr.
Grantly
had
roused
her
wrath
.
<EOS>
And
so
they
parted
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
some
trouble
in
arranging
the
method
of
Eleanor
's
return
.
<EOS>
She
begged
her
father
to
send
for
a
post
-
chaise
,
but
when
Mrs.
Grantly
heard
of
this
,
she
objected
strongly
.
<EOS>
If
Eleanor
would
go
away
in
dudgeon
with
the
archdeacon
,
why
should
she
let
all
the
servants
and
all
the
neighbourhood
know
that
she
had
done
so
?
<EOS>
So
at
last
Eleanor
consented
to
make
use
of
the
Plumstead
carriage
,
and
as
the
archdeacon
had
gone
out
immediately
after
breakfast
and
was
not
to
return
till
dinner
-
time
,
she
also
consented
to
postpone
her
journey
till
after
lunch
,
and
to
join
the
family
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
subject
of
the
quarrel
not
a
word
was
said
by
anyone
.
<EOS>
The
affair
of
the
carriage
was
arranged
by
Mr.
Harding
,
who
acted
as
Mercury
between
the
two
ladies
;
they
,
when
they
met
,
kissed
each
other
very
lovingly
and
then
sat
down
each
to
her
crochet
work
as
though
nothing
was
amiss
in
all
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
Another
Love
Scene
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
another
visitor
at
the
rectory
whose
feelings
in
this
unfortunate
matter
must
be
somewhat
strictly
analysed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
had
heard
from
his
friend
of
the
probability
of
Eleanor
's
marriage
with
Mr.
Slope
with
amazement
,
but
not
with
incredulity
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
said
that
he
was
not
in
love
with
Eleanor
,
and
up
to
this
period
this
certainly
had
been
true
.
<EOS>
But
as
soon
as
he
heard
that
she
loved
someone
else
,
he
began
to
be
very
fond
of
her
himself
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
make
up
his
mind
that
he
wished
to
have
her
for
his
wife
;
he
had
never
thought
of
her
,
and
did
not
now
think
of
her
,
in
connexion
with
himself
;
but
he
experienced
an
inward
,
indefinable
feeling
of
deep
regret
,
a
gnawing
sorrow
,
an
unconquerable
depression
of
spirits
,
and
also
a
species
of
self
-
abasement
that
he
 
he
,
Mr.
Arabin
 
had
not
done
something
to
prevent
that
other
he
,
that
vile
he
whom
he
so
thoroughly
despised
,
from
carrying
off
this
sweet
prize
.
  
<EOS>
Whatever
man
may
have
reached
the
age
of
forty
unmarried
without
knowing
something
of
such
feelings
must
have
been
very
successful
or
else
very
cold
-
hearted
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
had
never
thought
of
trimming
the
sails
of
his
bark
so
that
he
might
sail
as
convoy
to
this
rich
argosy
.
<EOS>
He
had
seen
that
Mrs.
Bold
was
beautiful
,
but
he
had
not
dreamt
of
making
her
beauty
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
Mrs.
Bold
was
rich
,
but
he
had
had
no
more
idea
of
appropriating
her
wealth
than
that
of
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
He
had
discovered
that
Mrs.
Bold
was
intelligent
,
warm
-
hearted
,
agreeable
,
sensible
,
all
in
fact
that
a
man
could
wish
his
wife
to
be
;
but
the
higher
were
her
attractions
,
the
greater
her
claims
to
consideration
,
<EOS>
the
less
had
he
imagined
that
he
might
possibly
become
the
possessor
of
them
.
<EOS>
Such
had
been
his
instinct
rather
than
his
thoughts
,
so
humble
and
so
diffident
.
<EOS>
Now
his
diffidence
was
to
be
rewarded
by
his
seeing
this
woman
,
whose
beauty
was
to
his
eyes
perfect
,
whose
wealth
was
such
as
to
have
deterred
him
from
thinking
of
her
,
whose
widowhood
would
have
silenced
him
had
he
not
been
so
deterred
,
by
his
seeing
her
become
the
prey
of
 
Obadiah
Slope
!
  
<EOS>
On
the
morning
of
Mrs.
Bold
's
departure
he
got
on
his
horse
to
ride
over
to
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
As
he
rode
he
kept
muttering
to
himself
a
line
from
Van
Artevelde
,
  
<EOS>
How
little
flattering
is
woman
's
love
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
he
strove
to
recall
his
mind
and
to
think
of
other
affairs
 
his
parish
,
his
college
,
his
creed
 
but
his
thoughts
<EOS>
would
revert
to
Mr.
Slope
and
the
Flemish
chieftain
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
think
upon
it
,
How
little
flattering
is
woman
's
love
,
Given
commonly
to
whosoe'er
<EOS>
is
nearest
And
propped
with
most
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
Mrs.
Bold
should
marry
anyone
but
him
 
he
had
not
put
himself
forward
as
a
suitor
 
but
that
she
should
marry
Mr.
Slope
;
and
so
he
repeated
over
again
    
<EOS>
Outward
grace
<EOS>
Nor
inward
light
is
needful
 
day
by
day
<EOS>
Men
wanting
both
are
mated
with
the
best
And
loftiest
of
God
's
feminine
creation
,
Whose
love
takes
no
distinction
but
of
gender
,
And
ridicules
the
very
name
of
choice
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
he
went
on
,
troubled
much
in
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
but
an
uneasy
ride
of
it
that
morning
,
and
little
good
<EOS>
did
he
do
at
St.
Ewold
's
.
  
<EOS>
The
necessary
alterations
in
his
house
were
being
fast
completed
,
and
he
walked
through
the
rooms
,
and
went
up
and
down
the
stairs
,
and
rambled
through
the
garden
,
but
he
could
not
wake
himself
to
much
interest
about
them
.
<EOS>
He
stood
still
at
every
window
to
look
out
and
think
upon
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
At
almost
every
window
he
had
before
stood
and
chatted
with
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
She
and
Mrs.
Grantly
had
been
there
continually
;
and
while
Mrs.
Grantly
had
been
giving
orders
,
and
seeing
that
orders
had
been
complied
with
,
he
and
Eleanor
had
conversed
on
all
things
appertaining
to
a
clergyman
's
profession
.
<EOS>
He
thought
how
often
he
had
laid
down
the
law
to
her
and
how
sweetly
she
had
borne
with
his
somewhat
dictatorial
decrees
.
<EOS>
He
remembered
her
listening
intelligence
,
her
gentle
but
quick
replies
,
her
interest
in
all
that
concerned
the
church
,
in
all
that
concerned
him
;
and
then
he
struck
his
riding
-
whip
against
the
window
-
sill
and
declared
to
himself
that
it
was
impossible
that
Eleanor
Bold
should
marry
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
he
did
not
really
believe
,
as
he
should
have
done
,
that
it
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
known
her
well
enough
to
feel
that
it
was
truly
impossible
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
been
aware
that
Eleanor
had
that
within
her
which
would
surely
protect
her
from
such
degradation
.
<EOS>
But
he
,
like
so
many
others
,
was
deficient
in
confidence
in
woman
.
<EOS>
He
said
to
himself
over
and
over
again
that
it
was
impossible
that
Eleanor
Bold
should
become
Mrs.
Slope
,
and
yet
he
believed
that
she
would
do
so
.
<EOS>
And
so
he
rambled
about
,
and
could
do
and
think
of
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
was
thoroughly
uncomfortable
,
thoroughly
ill
at
ease
,
cross
with
himself
and
everybody
else
,
and
feeding
in
his
heart
on
animosity
towards
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
This
was
not
as
it
should
be
,
as
he
knew
and
felt
,
but
he
could
not
help
himself
.
<EOS>
In
truth
Mr.
Arabin
was
now
in
love
with
Mrs.
Bold
,
though
ignorant
of
the
fact
himself
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
love
and
,
though
forty
years
old
,
was
in
love
without
being
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
fumed
and
fretted
and
did
not
know
what
was
the
matter
,
as
a
youth
might
do
at
one
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
And
so
having
done
no
good
at
St.
Ewold
's
,
he
rode
back
much
earlier
than
was
usual
with
him
,
instigated
by
some
inward
,
unacknowledged
hope
that
he
might
see
Mrs.
Bold
before
she
left
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
had
not
passed
a
pleasant
morning
.
<EOS>
She
was
irritated
with
everyone
,
and
not
least
with
herself
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
she
had
been
hardly
used
,
but
she
felt
also
that
she
had
not
played
her
own
cards
well
.
<EOS>
She
should
have
held
herself
so
far
above
suspicion
as
to
have
received
her
sister
's
innuendoes
and
the
archdeacon
's
lecture
with
indifference
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
done
this
,
but
had
shown
herself
angry
and
sore
,
and
was
now
ashamed
of
her
own
petulance
,
yet
unable
to
discontinue
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
greater
part
of
the
morning
she
had
spent
alone
,
<EOS>
but
after
awhile
her
father
joined
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
fully
made
up
his
mind
that
,
come
what
come
might
,
nothing
should
separate
him
from
his
younger
daughter
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
hard
task
for
him
to
reconcile
himself
to
the
idea
of
seeing
her
at
the
head
of
Mr.
Slope
's
table
,
but
he
got
through
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
as
he
argued
to
himself
,
was
a
respectable
man
and
a
clergyman
,
and
he
,
as
Eleanor
's
father
,
had
no
right
even
to
endeavour
to
prevent
her
from
marrying
such
a
one
.
<EOS>
He
longed
to
tell
her
how
he
had
determined
to
prefer
her
to
all
the
world
,
how
he
was
prepared
to
admit
that
she
was
not
wrong
,
how
thoroughly
he
differed
from
Dr.
Grantly
;
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
mention
Mr.
Slope
's
name
.
<EOS>
There
was
yet
a
chance
that
they
were
all
wrong
in
their
surmise
,
and
being
thus
in
doubt
,
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
speak
openly
to
her
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
sitting
with
her
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
,
saying
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
some
little
soft
words
of
affection
and
working
hard
with
his
imaginary
fiddle
-
bow
,
when
Mr.
Arabin
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
got
up
,
and
the
two
made
some
trite
remarks
to
each
other
,
neither
thinking
of
what
he
was
saying
,
while
Eleanor
kept
her
seat
on
the
sofa
,
mute
and
moody
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
was
included
in
the
list
of
those
against
whom
her
anger
was
excited
.
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
had
dared
to
talk
about
her
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Slope
;
he
,
too
,
had
dared
to
blame
her
for
not
making
an
enemy
of
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
intended
to
see
him
before
her
departure
,
and
was
now
but
little
inclined
to
be
gracious
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
feeling
through
the
whole
house
that
something
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
when
he
saw
Eleanor
,
could
not
succeed
in
looking
or
in
speaking
as
though
he
knew
nothing
of
all
this
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
cheerful
and
positive
and
contradictory
with
her
,
as
was
his
wo
nt
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
two
minutes
in
the
room
before
he
felt
that
he
had
done
wrong
to
return
;
and
the
moment
he
heard
her
voice
,
he
thoroughly
wished
himself
back
at
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
Why
,
indeed
,
should
he
have
wished
to
have
aught
further
to
say
to
the
future
wife
of
Mr.
Slope
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
hear
that
you
are
to
leave
us
so
soon
,
"
said
he
,
striving
in
vain
to
use
his
ordinary
voice
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
this
she
muttered
something
about
the
necessity
of
her
being
in
Barchester
,
and
betook
herself
most
industriously
to
her
crochet
work
.
  
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
little
more
trite
conversation
between
Mr.
Arabin
and
Mr.
Harding
 
trite
,
and
hard
,
and
vapid
,
and
senseless
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
had
anything
to
say
to
the
other
,
and
yet
neither
at
such
a
moment
liked
to
remain
silent
.
<EOS>
At
last
Mr.
Harding
,
taking
advantage
of
a
pause
,
escaped
out
of
the
room
,
and
Eleanor
and
Mr.
Arabin
were
left
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
going
will
be
a
great
break
-
up
to
our
party
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
She
again
muttered
something
which
was
all
but
inaudible
,
but
kept
her
eyes
fixed
upon
her
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
had
a
very
pleasant
month
here
,
"
said
he
;
"
at
least
I
have
;
and
I
am
sorry
it
should
be
so
soon
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
been
from
home
longer
than
I
intended
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
it
is
time
that
I
should
return
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
pleasant
hours
and
pleasant
days
must
come
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
pity
that
so
few
of
them
are
pleasant
;
or
perhaps
,
rather
 
"
  
"
It
is
a
pity
,
certainly
,
that
men
and
women
do
so
much
to
destroy
the
pleasantness
of
their
days
,
"
said
she
,
interrupting
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
pity
that
there
should
be
so
little
charity
abroad
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Charity
should
begin
at
home
,
"
said
he
,
and
he
was
proceeding
to
explain
that
he
as
a
clergyman
could
not
be
what
she
would
call
charitable
at
the
expense
of
those
principles
<EOS>
which
he
considered
it
his
duty
to
teach
,
when
he
remembered
that
it
would
be
worse
than
vain
to
argue
on
such
a
matter
with
the
future
wife
of
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
just
leaving
us
,
"
he
continued
,
"
and
I
will
not
weary
your
last
hour
with
another
lecture
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
I
fear
I
have
given
you
too
many
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
practise
as
well
as
preach
,
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Undoubtedly
I
should
.
<EOS>
So
should
we
all
.
<EOS>
All
of
us
who
presume
to
teach
are
bound
to
do
our
utmost
towards
fulfilling
our
own
lessons
.
<EOS>
I
thoroughly
allow
my
deficiency
in
doing
so
,
but
I
do
not
quite
know
now
to
what
you
allude
.
<EOS>
Have
you
any
special
reason
for
telling
me
now
that
I
should
practise
as
well
as
preach
?
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
made
no
answer
.
<EOS>
She
longed
to
let
him
know
the
cause
of
her
anger
,
to
upbraid
him
for
speaking
of
her
disrespectfully
,
and
then
at
last
to
forgive
him
,
and
so
part
friends
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
she
would
be
unhappy
to
leave
him
in
her
present
frame
of
mind
,
but
yet
she
could
hardly
bring
herself
to
speak
to
him
of
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
And
how
could
she
allude
to
the
innuendo
thrown
out
by
the
archdeacon
,
and
thrown
out
,
as
she
believed
,
at
the
instigation
of
Mr.
Arabin
?
<EOS>
She
wanted
to
make
him
know
that
he
was
wrong
,
to
make
him
aware
that
he
had
ill
-
treated
her
,
in
order
that
the
sweetness
of
her
forgiveness
might
be
enhanced
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
she
liked
him
too
well
to
be
contented
to
part
with
him
in
displeasure
,
yet
she
could
not
get
over
her
deep
displeasure
without
some
explanation
,
some
acknowledgement
on
his
part
,
some
assurance
that
he
would
never
again
so
sin
against
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
tell
me
that
I
should
practise
what
I
preach
?
<EOS>
"
continued
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
men
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Certainly
.
<EOS>
That
is
as
it
were
understood
and
acknowledged
.
<EOS>
But
you
do
not
say
so
to
all
men
,
or
to
all
clergymen
.
<EOS>
The
advice
,
good
as
it
is
,
is
not
given
except
in
allusion
to
some
special
deficiency
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
tell
me
my
special
deficiency
,
I
will
endeavour
to
profit
by
the
advice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
for
awhile
and
then
,
looking
full
in
his
face
,
she
said
,
"
You
are
not
bold
enough
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
to
speak
out
to
me
openly
and
plainly
,
and
yet
you
expect
me
,
a
woman
,
to
speak
openly
to
you
.
<EOS>
Why
did
you
speak
calumny
of
me
to
Dr.
Grantly
behind
my
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Calumny
!
"
said
he
,
and
his
whole
face
became
suffused
with
blood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
calumny
?
<EOS>
If
I
have
spoken
calumny
of
you
,
I
will
beg
your
pardon
,
and
his
to
whom
I
spoke
it
,
and
God
's
pardon
also
.
<EOS>
But
what
calumny
have
I
spoken
of
you
to
Dr.
Grantly
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
also
blushed
deeply
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
ask
him
whether
he
had
not
spoken
of
her
as
another
man
's
wife
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
best
yourself
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
ask
you
as
a
man
of
honour
,
if
you
have
not
spoken
of
me
as
you
would
not
have
spoken
of
your
own
sister
 
or
<EOS>
rather
I
will
not
ask
you
,
"
she
continued
,
finding
that
he
did
not
immediately
answer
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
put
you
to
the
necessity
of
answering
such
a
question
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
has
told
me
what
you
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Dr.
Grantly
certainly
asked
me
for
my
advice
,
and
I
gave
it
.
<EOS>
He
asked
me
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
did
,
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
He
asked
you
whether
he
would
be
doing
right
to
receive
me
at
Plumstead
if
I
continued
my
acquaintance
with
a
gentleman
who
happens
to
be
personally
disagreeable
to
yourself
and
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
mistaken
,
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
Mr.
Slope
;
I
never
met
him
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
the
less
individually
hostile
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
for
me
to
question
the
propriety
of
your
enmity
,
but
I
had
a
right
to
expect
that
my
name
should
not
have
been
mixed
up
in
your
hostilities
.
<EOS>
This
has
been
done
,
and
been
done
by
you
in
a
manner
the
most
injurious
and
the
most
distressing
to
me
as
a
woman
.
<EOS>
I
must
confess
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
that
from
you
I
expected
a
different
sort
of
usage
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
she
with
difficulty
restrained
her
tears
 
<EOS>
but
she
did
restrain
them
.
<EOS>
Had
she
given
way
and
sobbed
aloud
,
as
in
such
cases
a
woman
should
do
,
he
would
have
melted
at
once
,
implored
her
pardon
,
perhaps
knelt
at
her
feet
and
declared
his
love
.
<EOS>
Everything
would
have
been
explained
,
and
Eleanor
would
have
gone
back
to
Barchester
with
a
contented
mind
.
<EOS>
How
easily
would
she
have
forgiven
and
forgotten
the
archdeacon
's
suspicions
had
she
but
heard
the
whole
truth
from
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
But
then
where
would
have
been
my
novel
?
<EOS>
She
did
not
cry
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
did
not
melt
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
me
an
injustice
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
My
advice
was
asked
by
Dr.
Grantly
,
and
I
was
obliged
to
give
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dr.
Grantly
has
been
most
officious
,
most
impertinent
.
<EOS>
I
have
as
complete
a
right
to
form
my
acquaintance
as
he
has
to
form
his
.
<EOS>
What
would
you
have
said
had
I
consulted
you
as
to
the
propriety
of
my
banishing
Dr.
Grantly
from
my
house
because
he
knows
Lord
Tattenham
Corner
?
<EOS>
I
am
sure
Lord
Tattenham
is
quite
as
objectionable
an
acquaintance
for
a
clergyman
as
Mr.
Slope
is
for
a
clergyman
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
Lord
Tattenham
Corner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
but
Dr.
Grantly
does
.
<EOS>
It
is
nothing
to
me
if
he
knows
all
the
young
lords
on
every
race
-
course
in
England
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
interfere
with
him
,
nor
shall
he
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
differ
with
you
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
but
as
you
have
spoken
to
me
on
this
matter
,
and
especially
as
you
blame
me
for
what
little
I
said
on
the
subject
,
I
must
tell
you
that
I
do
differ
from
you
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
's
position
as
a
man
in
the
world
gives
him
a
right
to
choose
his
own
acquaintances
,
subject
to
certain
influences
.
<EOS>
If
he
chooses
them
badly
,
those
influences
will
be
used
.
<EOS>
If
he
consorts
with
persons
unsuitable
to
him
,
his
bishop
will
interfere
.
<EOS>
What
the
bishop
is
to
Dr.
Grantly
,
Dr.
Grantly
is
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
deny
it
.
<EOS>
I
utterly
deny
it
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
jumping
from
her
seat
and
literally
flashing
before
Mr.
Arabin
,
as
she
stood
on
the
drawing
-
room
floor
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
seen
her
so
excited
<EOS>
,
he
had
never
seen
her
look
half
so
beautiful
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
utterly
deny
it
,
"
said
she
.
"
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
has
no
sort
of
jurisdiction
over
me
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
Do
you
and
he
forget
that
I
am
not
altogether
alone
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
Do
you
forget
that
I
have
a
father
?
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
,
I
believe
,
always
has
forgotten
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
From
you
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
"
she
continued
,
"
I
would
have
listened
to
advice
because
I
should
have
expected
it
to
have
been
given
as
one
friend
may
advise
another
 
not
as
a
schoolmaster
gives
an
order
to
a
pupil
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
differed
from
you
 
on
this
matter
<EOS>
I
should
have
done
so
 
but
had
you
spoken
to
me
in
your
usual
manner
and
with
your
usual
freedom
,
I
should
not
have
been
angry
.
<EOS>
But
now
 
was
it
manly
of
you
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
to
speak
of
me
in
this
way
 
<EOS>
so
disrespectful
 
<EOS>
so
 
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
repeat
what
you
said
.
<EOS>
You
must
understand
what
I
feel
.
<EOS>
Was
it
just
of
you
to
speak
of
me
in
such
a
way
and
to
advise
my
sister
's
husband
to
turn
me
out
of
my
sister
's
house
because
I
chose
to
know
a
man
of
whose
doctrine
you
disapprove
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
alternative
left
to
me
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
"
said
he
,
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
-
place
,
looking
down
intently
at
the
carpet
pattern
,
and
speaking
with
a
slow
,
measured
voice
,
"
but
to
tell
you
plainly
what
did
take
place
between
me
and
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
she
,
finding
that
he
paused
for
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
that
what
I
may
say
may
pain
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
well
do
so
more
than
what
you
have
already
done
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dr.
Grantly
asked
me
whether
I
thought
it
would
be
prudent
for
him
to
receive
you
in
his
house
as
the
wife
of
Mr.
Slope
,
and
I
told
him
that
I
thought
it
would
be
imprudent
.
<EOS>
Believing
it
to
be
utterly
impossible
that
Mr.
Slope
and
 
"
  
"
Thank
you
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
that
is
sufficient
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
know
your
reasons
,
"
said
she
,
speaking
with
a
terribly
calm
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
shown
to
this
gentleman
the
commonplace
civility
of
a
neighbour
;
and
because
I
have
done
so
,
because
I
have
not
indulged
against
him
in
all
the
rancour
and
hatred
which
you
and
Dr.
Grantly
consider
due
to
all
clergymen
who
do
not
agree
with
yourselves
,
you
conclude
that
I
am
to
marry
him
;
or
rather
you
do
not
conclude
<EOS>
so
 
no
rational
man
could
really
come
to
such
an
outrageous
conclusion
without
better
ground
;
you
have
not
thought
so
,
but
,
as
I
am
in
a
position
in
which
such
an
accusation
must
be
peculiarly
painful
,
it
is
made
in
order
that
I
may
be
terrified
into
hostility
against
this
enemy
of
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
finished
speaking
,
she
walked
to
the
drawing
-
room
window
and
stepped
out
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
was
left
in
the
room
,
still
occupied
in
counting
the
pattern
on
the
carpet
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
however
,
distinctly
heard
and
accurately
marked
every
word
that
she
had
spoken
.
<EOS>
Was
it
not
clear
from
what
she
had
said
that
the
archdeacon
had
been
wrong
in
imputing
to
her
any
attachment
to
Mr.
Slope
?
<EOS>
Was
it
not
clear
that
Eleanor
was
still
free
to
make
another
choice
?
<EOS>
It
may
seem
strange
that
he
should
for
a
moment
have
had
a
doubt
,
and
yet
he
did
doubt
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
absolutely
denied
the
charge
;
she
had
not
expressly
said
that
it
was
untrue
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
understood
little
of
the
nature
of
a
woman
's
feelings
,
or
he
would
have
known
how
improbable
it
was
that
she
should
make
any
clearer
declaration
than
she
had
done
.
<EOS>
Few
men
do
understand
the
nature
of
a
woman
's
heart
,
till
years
have
robbed
such
understanding
of
its
value
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
well
that
it
should
be
so
,
or
men
would
triumph
too
easily
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
stood
counting
the
carpet
,
unhappy
,
wretchedly
unhappy
,
at
the
hard
words
that
had
been
spoken
to
him
,
and
yet
happy
,
exquisitely
happy
,
as
he
thought
that
after
all
the
woman
whom
he
so
regarded
was
not
to
become
the
wife
of
the
man
whom
he
so
much
disliked
.
<EOS>
As
he
stood
there
he
began
to
be
aware
that
he
was
himself
in
love
.
<EOS>
Forty
years
had
passed
over
his
head
,
and
as
yet
woman
's
beauty
had
never
given
him
an
uneasy
hour
.
<EOS>
His
present
hour
was
very
uneasy
.
  
<EOS>
Not
that
he
remained
there
for
half
or
a
quarter
of
that
time
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
what
Eleanor
had
said
,
Mr.
Arabin
was
,
in
truth
,
a
manly
man
.
<EOS>
Having
ascertained
that
he
loved
this
woman
,
and
having
now
reason
to
believe
that
she
was
free
to
receive
his
love
,
at
least
if
she
pleased
to
do
so
,
he
followed
her
into
the
garden
to
make
such
wooing
as
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
not
long
in
finding
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
walking
to
and
fro
beneath
the
avenue
of
elms
that
stood
in
the
archdeacon
's
grounds
,
skirting
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
What
had
passed
between
her
and
Mr.
Arabin
had
not
,
alas
,
tended
to
lessen
the
acerbity
of
her
spirit
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
angry
 
more
angry
with
him
than
with
anyone
.
<EOS>
How
could
he
have
so
misunderstood
her
?
<EOS>
She
had
been
so
intimate
with
him
,
had
allowed
him
such
latitude
in
what
he
had
chosen
to
say
to
her
,
had
complied
with
his
ideas
,
cherished
his
views
,
fostered
his
precepts
,
cared
for
his
comforts
,
made
much
of
him
in
every
way
in
which
a
pretty
woman
can
make
much
of
an
unmarried
man
without
committing
herself
or
her
feelings
!
<EOS>
She
had
been
doing
this
,
and
while
she
had
been
doing
it
<EOS>
he
had
regarded
her
as
the
affianced
wife
of
another
man
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
passed
along
the
avenue
,
every
now
and
then
an
unbidden
tear
would
force
itself
on
her
cheek
,
and
as
she
raised
her
hand
to
brush
it
away
,
she
stamped
with
her
little
foot
upon
the
sward
with
very
spite
to
think
that
she
had
been
so
treated
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
was
very
near
to
her
when
she
first
saw
him
,
and
she
turned
short
round
and
retraced
her
steps
down
the
avenue
,
trying
to
rid
her
cheeks
of
all
trace
of
the
tell
-
tale
tears
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
needless
endeavour
,
for
Mr.
Arabin
was
in
a
state
of
mind
that
hardly
allowed
him
to
observe
such
trifles
.
<EOS>
He
followed
her
down
the
walk
and
overtook
her
just
as
she
reached
the
end
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
considered
how
he
would
address
her
;
he
had
not
thought
what
he
would
say
.
<EOS>
He
had
only
felt
that
it
was
wretchedness
to
him
to
quarrel
with
her
,
and
that
it
would
be
happiness
to
be
allowed
to
love
her
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
could
not
lower
himself
by
asking
her
pardon
.
<EOS>
He
had
done
her
no
wrong
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
calumniated
her
,
not
injured
her
,
as
she
had
accused
him
of
doing
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
confess
sins
of
which
he
had
not
been
guilty
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
let
the
past
be
past
and
ask
her
as
to
her
and
his
hopes
for
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
we
are
not
to
part
as
enemies
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
shall
be
no
enmity
on
my
part
,
"
said
Eleanor
;
"
I
endeavour
to
avoid
all
enmities
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
hollow
pretence
were
I
to
say
that
there
can
be
true
friendship
between
us
,
after
what
has
just
passed
.
<EOS>
People
can
not
make
their
friends
of
those
whom
they
despise
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
am
I
despised
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
been
so
before
you
could
have
spoken
of
me
as
you
did
.
<EOS>
And
I
was
deceived
,
cruelly
deceived
.
<EOS>
I
believed
that
you
thought
well
of
me
;
I
believed
that
you
esteemed
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thought
well
of
you
and
esteemed
you
!
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
justifying
myself
before
you
,
I
must
use
stronger
words
than
those
.
"
<EOS>
He
paused
for
a
moment
,
and
Eleanor
's
heart
beat
with
painful
violence
within
her
bosom
as
she
waited
for
him
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
esteemed
,
do
esteem
you
,
as
I
never
yet
esteemed
any
woman
.
<EOS>
Think
well
of
you
!
<EOS>
I
never
thought
to
think
so
well
,
so
much
of
any
human
creature
.
<EOS>
Speak
calumny
of
you
!
<EOS>
Insult
you
!
<EOS>
Wilfully
injure
you
!
<EOS>
I
wish
it
were
my
privilege
to
shield
you
from
calumny
,
insult
,
and
injury
.
<EOS>
Calumny
!
<EOS>
Ah
me
!
"
<EOS>
Twere
almost
better
that
it
were
so
.
<EOS>
Better
than
to
worship
with
a
sinful
worship
;
sinful
and
vain
also
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
then
he
walked
along
beside
her
,
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
,
looking
down
on
the
grass
beneath
his
feet
and
utterly
at
a
loss
how
to
express
his
meaning
.
<EOS>
And
Eleanor
walked
beside
him
determined
at
least
to
give
him
no
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
uttered
at
last
,
speaking
rather
to
himself
than
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
me
!
<EOS>
These
Plumstead
walks
were
pleasant
enough
,
if
one
could
have
but
heart
's
ease
,
but
without
that
the
dull
,
dead
stones
of
Oxford
were
far
preferable
 
and
St.
Ewold
's
,
too
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
,
I
am
beginning
to
think
that
I
mistook
myself
when
I
came
hither
.
<EOS>
A
Romish
priest
now
would
have
escaped
all
this
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Father
of
heaven
,
how
good
for
us
would
it
be
if
thou
couldest
vouchsafe
to
us
a
certain
rule
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
have
we
not
a
certain
rule
,
Mr.
Arabin
?
"
  
"
Yes
 
yes
,
surely
;
"
Lead
us
not
into
temptation
but
deliver
us
from
evil
.
"
<EOS>
But
what
is
temptation
?
<EOS>
What
is
evil
?
<EOS>
Is
this
evil
 
<EOS>
is
this
temptation
?
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Arabin
!
<EOS>
It
would
not
come
out
of
him
,
that
deep
,
true
love
of
his
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bring
himself
to
utter
it
in
plain
language
that
would
require
and
demand
an
answer
.
<EOS>
He
knew
not
how
to
say
to
the
woman
by
his
side
,
"
Since
the
fact
is
that
you
do
not
love
that
other
man
,
that
you
are
not
to
be
his
wife
,
can
you
love
me
,
will
you
be
my
wife
?
<EOS>
"
These
were
the
words
which
were
in
his
heart
,
but
with
all
his
sighs
he
could
not
draw
them
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
given
anything
,
everything
for
power
to
ask
this
simple
question
,
but
glib
as
was
his
tongue
in
pulpits
and
on
platforms
,
now
he
could
not
find
a
word
wherewith
to
express
the
plain
wish
of
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
Eleanor
understood
him
as
thoroughly
as
though
he
had
declared
his
passion
with
all
the
elegant
fluency
of
a
practised
Lothario
.
<EOS>
With
a
woman
's
instinct
,
she
followed
every
bend
of
his
mind
as
he
spoke
of
the
pleasantness
of
Plumstead
and
the
stones
of
Oxford
,
as
he
alluded
to
the
safety
of
the
Romish
priest
and
the
hidden
perils
of
temptation
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
it
all
meant
love
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
this
man
at
her
side
,
this
accomplished
scholar
,
this
practised
orator
,
this
great
polemical
combatant
,
was
striving
and
striving
in
vain
to
tell
her
that
his
heart
was
no
longer
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
She
knew
this
,
and
felt
a
sort
of
joy
in
knowing
it
;
yet
she
would
not
come
to
his
aid
.
<EOS>
He
had
offended
her
deeply
,
had
treated
her
unworthily
,
the
more
unworthily
seeing
that
he
had
learnt
to
love
her
,
and
Eleanor
could
not
bring
herself
to
abandon
her
revenge
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
ask
herself
whether
or
no
she
would
ultimately
accept
his
love
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
even
acknowledge
to
herself
that
she
now
perceived
it
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
At
the
present
moment
it
did
not
touch
her
heart
;
it
merely
appeased
her
pride
and
flattered
her
vanity
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
had
dared
to
associate
her
name
with
that
of
Mr.
Slope
,
and
now
her
spirit
was
soothed
by
finding
that
he
would
fain
associate
it
with
his
own
.
<EOS>
And
so
she
walked
on
beside
him
,
inhaling
incense
but
giving
out
no
sweetness
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
Answer
me
this
,
"
said
Mr.
Arabin
,
stopping
suddenly
in
his
walk
and
stepping
forward
so
that
he
faced
his
companion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Answer
me
this
one
question
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
love
Mr.
Slope
?
<EOS>
You
do
not
intend
to
be
his
wife
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
certainly
did
not
go
the
right
way
to
win
such
a
woman
as
Eleanor
Bold
.
<EOS>
Just
as
her
wrath
was
evaporating
,
as
it
was
disappearing
before
the
true
warmth
of
his
untold
love
,
he
rekindled
it
by
a
most
useless
repetition
of
his
original
sin
.
<EOS>
Had
he
known
what
he
was
about
,
he
should
never
have
mentioned
Mr.
Slope
's
name
before
Eleanor
Bold
,
till
he
had
made
her
all
his
own
.
<EOS>
Then
,
and
not
till
then
,
he
might
have
talked
of
Mr.
Slope
with
as
much
triumph
as
he
chose
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
answer
no
such
question
,
"
said
she
;
"
and
what
is
more
,
I
must
tell
you
that
nothing
can
justify
your
asking
it
.
<EOS>
Good
morning
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
saying
,
she
stepped
proudly
across
the
lawn
and
,
passing
through
the
drawing
-
room
window
,
joined
her
father
and
sister
at
lunch
in
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
afterwards
she
was
in
the
carriage
,
and
so
she
left
Plumstead
without
again
seeing
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
His
walk
was
long
and
sad
among
the
sombre
trees
that
overshadowed
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
He
left
the
archdeacon
's
grounds
that
he
might
escape
attention
,
and
sauntered
among
the
green
hillocks
under
which
lay
at
rest
<EOS>
so
many
of
the
once
loving
swains
and
forgotten
beauties
of
Plumstead
.
<EOS>
To
his
ears
Eleanor
's
last
words
sounded
like
a
knell
never
to
be
reversed
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
comprehend
that
she
might
be
angry
with
him
,
indignant
with
him
,
remorseless
with
him
,
and
yet
love
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
make
up
his
mind
whether
or
no
Mr.
Slope
was
in
truth
a
favoured
rival
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
why
should
she
not
have
answered
his
question
?
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Arabin
 
untaught
,
illiterate
,
boorish
,
ignorant
man
!
<EOS>
That
at
forty
years
of
age
you
should
know
so
little
of
the
workings
of
a
woman
's
heart
!
   
<EOS>
The
Bishop
's
Library
 
<EOS>
And
thus
the
pleasant
party
at
Plumstead
was
broken
up
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
a
very
pleasant
party
as
long
as
they
had
all
remained
in
good
humour
with
one
another
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
had
felt
her
house
to
be
gayer
and
brighter
than
it
had
been
for
many
a
long
day
,
and
the
archdeacon
had
been
aware
that
the
month
had
passed
pleasantly
without
attributing
the
pleasure
to
any
other
special
merits
than
those
of
his
own
hospitality
.
<EOS>
Within
three
or
four
days
of
Eleanor
's
departure
,
Mr.
Harding
had
also
returned
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
had
gone
to
Oxford
to
spend
one
week
there
previous
to
his
settling
at
the
vicarage
of
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
He
had
gone
laden
with
many
messages
to
Dr.
Gwynne
touching
the
iniquity
of
the
doings
in
Barchester
palace
and
the
peril
in
which
it
was
believed
the
hospital
still
stood
in
spite
of
the
assurances
contained
in
Mr.
Slope
's
inauspicious
letter
.
  
<EOS>
During
Eleanor
's
drive
into
Barchester
<EOS>
she
had
not
much
opportunity
of
reflecting
on
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
constrained
to
divert
her
mind
both
from
his
sins
and
his
love
by
the
necessity
of
conversing
with
her
sister
and
maintaining
the
appearance
of
parting
with
her
on
good
terms
.
<EOS>
When
the
carriage
reached
her
own
door
,
and
while
she
was
in
the
act
of
giving
her
last
kiss
to
her
sister
and
nieces
,
Mary
Bold
ran
out
and
exclaimed
:
  
"
Oh
,
Eleanor
,
have
you
heard
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mrs.
Grantly
,
have
you
heard
what
has
happened
?
<EOS>
The
poor
dean
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
heavens
!
"
said
Mrs.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
"
What
 
what
has
happened
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
This
morning
at
nine
he
had
a
fit
of
apoplexy
,
and
he
has
not
spoken
since
.
<EOS>
I
very
much
fear
that
by
this
time
he
is
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
had
been
very
intimate
with
the
dean
,
and
was
therefore
much
shocked
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
had
not
known
him
so
well
;
nevertheless
,
she
was
sufficiently
acquainted
with
his
person
and
manners
to
feel
startled
and
grieved
also
at
the
tidings
she
now
received
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
at
once
to
the
deanery
,
"
said
Mrs.
Grantly
;
"
the
archdeacon
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
will
be
there
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
any
news
to
send
you
,
I
will
let
Thomas
call
before
he
leaves
town
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
the
carriage
drove
off
,
leaving
Eleanor
and
her
baby
with
Mary
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
had
been
quite
right
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
was
at
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
into
Barchester
that
morning
by
himself
,
not
caring
to
intrude
himself
upon
Eleanor
,
and
he
also
immediately
on
his
arrival
had
heard
of
the
dean
's
fit
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
as
we
have
before
said
,
a
library
or
reading
-
room
connecting
the
cathedral
with
the
dean
's
house
.
<EOS>
This
was
generally
called
the
bishop
's
library
,
because
a
certain
bishop
of
Barchester
was
supposed
to
have
added
it
to
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
It
was
built
immediately
over
a
portion
of
the
cloisters
,
and
a
flight
of
stairs
descended
from
it
into
the
room
in
which
the
cathedral
clergymen
put
their
surplices
on
and
off
.
<EOS>
As
it
also
opened
directly
into
the
dean
's
house
,
it
was
the
passage
through
which
that
dignitary
usually
went
to
his
public
devotions
.
<EOS>
Who
had
or
had
not
the
right
of
entry
into
it
,
it
might
be
difficult
to
say
;
but
the
people
of
Barchester
believed
that
it
belonged
to
the
dean
,
and
the
clergymen
of
Barchester
believed
that
it
belonged
to
the
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
morning
in
question
most
of
the
resident
clergymen
who
constituted
the
chapter
,
and
some
few
others
,
were
here
assembled
,
and
among
them
as
usual
the
archdeacon
towered
with
high
authority
.
<EOS>
He
had
heard
of
the
dean
's
fit
before
he
was
over
the
bridge
which
led
into
the
town
,
and
had
at
once
come
to
the
well
-
known
clerical
trysting
place
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
there
by
eleven
o'clock
,
and
had
remained
ever
since
.
<EOS>
From
time
to
time
the
medical
men
who
had
been
called
in
came
through
from
the
deanery
into
the
library
,
uttered
little
bulletins
,
and
then
returned
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
it
appears
,
very
little
hope
of
the
old
man
's
rallying
,
indeed
<EOS>
no
hope
of
anything
like
a
final
recovery
.
<EOS>
The
only
question
was
whether
he
must
die
at
once
speechless
,
unconscious
,
stricken
to
death
by
his
first
heavy
fit
,
or
whether
by
due
aid
of
medical
skill
he
might
not
be
so
far
brought
back
to
this
world
as
to
become
conscious
of
his
state
and
enabled
to
address
one
prayer
to
his
Maker
before
he
was
called
to
meet
Him
face
to
face
at
the
judgement
seat
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Omicron
Pie
had
been
sent
for
from
London
.
<EOS>
That
great
man
had
shown
himself
a
wonderful
adept
at
keeping
life
still
moving
within
an
old
man
's
heart
in
the
case
of
good
old
Bishop
Grantly
,
and
it
might
be
reasonably
expected
that
he
would
be
equally
successful
with
a
dean
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Dr.
Fillgrave
and
Mr.
Rerechild
were
doing
their
best
,
and
poor
Miss
Trefoil
sat
at
the
head
of
her
father
's
bed
,
longing
,
as
in
such
cases
daughters
do
long
,
to
be
allowed
to
do
something
to
show
her
love
 
if
it
were
only
to
chafe
his
feet
with
her
hands
,
or
wait
in
menial
offices
on
those
autocratic
doctors
 
anything
so
that
now
in
the
time
of
need
she
might
be
of
use
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
alone
of
the
attendant
clergy
had
been
admitted
for
a
moment
into
the
sick
man
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
He
had
crept
in
with
creaking
shoes
,
had
said
with
smothered
voice
a
word
of
consolation
to
the
sorrowing
daughter
,
had
looked
on
the
distorted
face
of
his
old
friend
with
solemn
but
yet
eager
scrutinising
eye
,
as
though
he
said
in
his
heart
"
and
so
some
day
it
will
probably
be
with
me
,
"
and
then
,
having
whispered
an
unmeaning
word
or
two
to
the
doctors
,
had
creaked
his
way
back
again
into
the
library
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
never
speak
again
,
I
fear
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
as
he
noiselessly
closed
the
door
,
as
though
the
unconscious
dying
man
,
from
whom
all
sense
had
fled
,
would
have
heard
in
his
distant
chamber
the
spring
of
the
lock
which
was
now
so
carefully
handled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
Is
he
so
bad
?
"
<EOS>
said
the
meagre
little
prebendary
,
turning
over
in
his
own
mind
all
the
probable
candidates
for
the
deanery
and
wondering
whether
the
archdeacon
would
think
it
worth
his
while
to
accept
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
fit
must
have
been
very
violent
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
a
man
over
seventy
has
a
stroke
of
apoplexy
,
it
seldom
comes
very
lightly
,
"
said
the
burly
chancellor
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
an
excellent
,
sweet
-
tempered
man
,
"
said
one
of
the
vicars
choral
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Heaven
knows
how
we
shall
repair
his
loss
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
indeed
,
"
said
a
minor
canon
,
"
and
a
great
blessing
to
all
those
privileged
to
take
a
share
in
the
services
of
our
cathedral
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
government
will
appoint
,
Mr.
Archdeacon
.
<EOS>
I
trust
we
may
have
no
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
talk
about
his
successor
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
"
while
there
is
yet
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
of
course
not
,
"
said
the
minor
canon
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
exceedingly
indecorous
;
but
 
"
  
"
I
know
of
no
man
,
"
said
the
meagre
little
prebendary
,
"
who
has
better
interest
with
the
present
government
than
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slope
,
"
said
two
or
three
at
once
almost
sotto
voce
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
Dean
of
Barchester
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
"
exclaimed
the
burly
chancellor
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
bishop
would
do
anything
for
him
,
"
said
the
little
prebendary
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
would
Mrs.
Proudie
,
"
said
the
vicar
choral
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
"
said
the
chancellor
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
had
almost
turned
pale
at
the
idea
.
<EOS>
What
if
Mr.
Slope
should
become
Dean
of
Barchester
?
<EOS>
To
be
sure
there
was
no
adequate
ground
,
indeed
no
ground
at
all
,
for
presuming
that
such
a
desecration
could
even
be
contemplated
.
<EOS>
But
nevertheless
it
was
on
the
cards
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Proudie
had
interest
with
the
government
,
and
the
man
carried
as
it
were
Dr.
Proudie
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
How
should
they
all
conduct
themselves
if
Mr.
Slope
were
to
become
Dean
of
Barchester
?
<EOS>
The
bare
idea
for
a
moment
struck
even
Dr.
Grantly
dumb
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
certainly
not
be
very
pleasant
for
us
to
have
Mr.
Slope
at
the
deanery
,
"
said
the
little
prebendary
,
chuckling
inwardly
at
the
evident
consternation
which
his
surmise
had
created
.
  
<EOS>
"
About
as
pleasant
and
as
probable
as
having
you
in
the
palace
,
"
said
the
chancellor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
such
an
appointment
highly
improbable
,
"
said
the
minor
canon
,
"
and
,
moreover
,
extremely
injudicious
.
<EOS>
Should
not
you
,
Mr.
Archdeacon
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
presume
such
a
thing
to
be
quite
out
of
the
question
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
"
but
at
the
present
moment
I
am
thinking
rather
of
our
poor
friend
who
is
lying
so
near
us
than
of
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
of
course
,
"
said
the
vicar
choral
with
a
very
solemn
air
;
"
of
course
you
are
.
<EOS>
So
are
we
all
.
<EOS>
Poor
Dr.
Trefoil
;
the
best
of
men
,
but
 
"
  
"
It
's
the
most
comfortable
dean
's
residence
in
England
,
"
said
a
second
prebendary
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fifteen
acres
in
the
grounds
.
<EOS>
It
is
better
than
many
of
the
bishops
"
palaces
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
full
two
thousand
a
year
,
"
said
the
meagre
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
cut
down
to
£
1,200
,
"
said
the
chancellor
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
second
prebendary
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
to
be
fifteen
.
<EOS>
A
special
case
was
made
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
such
thing
,
"
said
the
chancellor
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
find
I
'm
right
,
"
said
the
prebendary
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
read
it
in
the
report
,
"
said
the
minor
canon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
"
said
the
chancellor
.
<EOS>
"
They
could
n't
do
it
.
<EOS>
There
were
to
be
no
exceptions
but
London
and
Durham
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
Canterbury
and
York
,
"
said
the
vicar
choral
modestly
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
,
Grantly
?
"
said
the
meagre
little
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
about
what
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
who
had
been
looking
as
though
he
were
thinking
about
his
friend
the
dean
,
but
who
had
in
reality
been
thinking
about
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
next
dean
to
have
,
twelve
or
fifteen
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Twelve
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
authoritatively
,
thereby
putting
an
end
at
once
to
all
doubt
and
dispute
among
his
subordinates
as
far
as
that
subject
was
concerned
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
certainly
thought
it
was
fifteen
,
"
said
the
minor
canon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
"
said
the
burly
chancellor
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
in
came
Dr.
Fillgrave
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
he
?
"
<EOS>
"
Is
he
conscious
?
"
<EOS>
"
Can
he
speak
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
dead
?
"
<EOS>
"
No
worse
news
,
Doctor
,
I
trust
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
I
trust
,
something
better
,
Doctor
?
"
said
half
a
dozen
voices
all
at
once
,
each
in
a
tone
of
extremest
anxiety
.
<EOS>
It
was
pleasant
to
see
how
popular
the
good
old
dean
was
among
his
clergy
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
change
,
gentlemen
;
not
the
slightest
change
.
<EOS>
But
a
telegraphic
message
has
arrived
 
Sir
Omicron
Pie
will
be
here
by
the
9.15
P.M.
train
.
<EOS>
If
any
man
can
do
anything
,
Sir
Omicron
Pie
will
do
it
.
<EOS>
But
all
that
skill
can
do
has
been
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
sure
of
that
,
Dr.
Fillgrave
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
;
"
we
are
quite
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
But
yet
you
know
 
"
  
"
Oh
,
quite
right
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
"
<EOS>
quite
right
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
done
just
the
same
 
<EOS>
I
advised
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
said
to
Rerechild
at
once
that
with
such
a
life
and
such
a
man
,
Sir
Omicron
should
be
summoned
 
of
course
<EOS>
I
knew
expense
was
nothing
 
<EOS>
so
distinguished
,
you
know
,
and
so
popular
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
all
that
human
skill
can
do
has
been
done
.
"
  
<EOS>
Just
at
this
period
Mrs.
Grantly
's
carriage
drove
into
the
close
,
and
the
archdeacon
went
down
to
confirm
the
news
which
she
had
heard
before
.
  
<EOS>
By
the
9.15
P.M.
train
Sir
Omicron
Pie
did
arrive
.
<EOS>
And
in
the
course
of
the
night
a
sort
of
consciousness
returned
to
the
poor
old
dean
.
<EOS>
Whether
this
was
due
to
Sir
Omicron
Pie
is
a
question
on
which
it
may
be
well
not
to
offer
an
opinion
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Fillgrave
was
very
clear
in
his
own
mind
,
but
Sir
Omicron
himself
is
thought
to
have
differed
from
that
learned
doctor
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
Sir
Omicron
expressed
an
opinion
that
the
dean
had
yet
some
days
to
live
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
eight
or
ten
next
days
,
accordingly
,
the
poor
dean
remained
in
the
same
state
,
half
-
conscious
and
half
-
comatose
;
and
the
attendant
clergy
began
to
think
that
no
new
appointment
would
be
necessary
for
some
few
months
to
come
.
   
<EOS>
A
New
Candidate
for
Ecclesiastical
Honours
 
<EOS>
The
dean
's
illness
occasioned
much
mental
turmoil
in
other
places
besides
the
deanery
and
adjoining
library
,
and
the
idea
which
occurred
to
the
meagre
little
prebendary
about
Mr.
Slope
did
not
occur
to
him
alone
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
was
sitting
listlessly
in
his
study
when
the
news
reached
him
of
the
dean
's
illness
.
<EOS>
It
was
brought
to
him
by
Mr.
Slope
,
who
of
course
was
not
the
last
person
in
Barchester
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
also
not
slow
in
finding
its
way
to
Mrs.
Proudie
's
ears
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
presumed
that
there
was
not
just
then
much
friendly
intercourse
between
these
two
rival
claimants
for
his
lordship
's
obedience
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
though
living
in
the
same
house
,
they
had
not
met
since
the
stormy
interview
between
them
in
the
bishop
's
study
on
the
preceding
day
.
  
<EOS>
On
that
occasion
Mrs.
Proudie
had
been
defeated
.
<EOS>
That
the
prestige
of
continual
victory
should
have
been
torn
from
her
standards
<EOS>
was
a
subject
of
great
sorrow
to
that
militant
lady
;
but
,
though
defeated
,
she
was
not
overcome
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
she
might
yet
recover
her
lost
ground
,
that
she
might
yet
hurl
Mr.
Slope
down
to
the
dust
from
which
she
had
picked
him
,
and
force
her
sinning
lord
to
sue
for
pardon
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
.
  
<EOS>
On
that
memorable
day
,
memorable
for
his
mutiny
and
rebellion
against
her
high
behests
,
he
had
carried
his
way
with
a
high
hand
,
and
had
really
begun
to
think
it
possible
that
the
days
of
his
slavery
were
counted
.
<EOS>
He
had
begun
to
hope
that
he
was
now
about
to
enter
into
a
free
land
,
a
land
delicious
with
milk
which
he
himself
might
quaff
and
honey
which
would
not
tantalize
him
by
being
only
honey
to
the
eye
.
<EOS>
When
Mrs.
Proudie
banged
the
door
as
she
left
his
room
,
he
felt
himself
every
inch
a
bishop
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
his
spirit
had
been
a
little
cowed
by
his
chaplain
's
subsequent
lecture
,
but
on
the
whole
he
was
highly
pleased
with
himself
,
and
he
flattered
himself
that
the
worst
was
over
.
"
<EOS>
_
Ce
n'est
que
le
premier
pas
qui
coûte
_
,
"
he
reflected
,
and
now
that
the
first
step
had
been
so
magnanimously
taken
,
all
the
rest
would
follow
easily
.
  
<EOS>
He
met
his
wife
as
a
matter
of
course
at
dinner
,
where
little
or
nothing
was
said
that
could
ruffle
the
bishop
's
happiness
.
<EOS>
His
daughters
and
the
servants
were
present
and
protected
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
made
one
or
two
trifling
remarks
on
the
subject
of
his
projected
visit
to
the
archbishop
,
in
order
to
show
to
all
concerned
that
he
intended
to
have
his
own
way
;
the
very
servants
,
perceiving
the
change
,
transferred
a
little
of
their
reverence
from
their
mistress
to
their
master
.
<EOS>
All
which
the
master
perceived
,
and
so
also
did
the
mistress
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Proudie
bided
her
time
.
  
<EOS>
After
dinner
he
returned
to
his
study
,
where
Mr.
Slope
soon
found
him
,
and
there
they
had
tea
together
and
planned
many
things
.
<EOS>
For
some
few
minutes
the
bishop
was
really
happy
;
but
as
the
clock
on
the
chimney
-
piece
warned
him
that
the
stilly
hours
of
night
were
drawing
on
,
as
he
looked
at
his
chamber
candlestick
and
knew
that
he
must
use
it
,
his
heart
sank
within
him
again
.
<EOS>
He
was
as
a
ghost
,
all
whose
power
of
wandering
free
through
these
upper
regions
ceases
at
cock
-
crow
;
or
,
rather
,
he
was
the
opposite
of
the
ghost
,
for
till
cock
-
crow
he
must
again
be
a
serf
.
<EOS>
And
would
that
be
all
?
<EOS>
Could
he
trust
himself
to
come
down
to
breakfast
a
free
man
in
the
morning
?
  
<EOS>
He
was
nearly
an
hour
later
than
usual
when
he
betook
himself
to
his
rest
.
<EOS>
Rest
!
<EOS>
What
rest
?
<EOS>
However
,
he
took
a
couple
of
glasses
of
sherry
and
mounted
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
Far
be
it
from
us
to
follow
him
thither
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
things
which
no
novelist
,
no
historian
,
should
attempt
;
some
few
scenes
in
life
's
drama
which
even
no
poet
should
dare
to
paint
.
<EOS>
Let
that
which
passed
between
Dr.
Proudie
and
his
wife
on
this
night
be
understood
to
be
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
down
the
following
morning
a
sad
and
thoughtful
man
.
<EOS>
He
was
attenuated
in
appearance
 
one
might
almost
say
emaciated
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
his
now
grizzled
locks
had
not
palpably
become
more
grey
than
on
the
preceding
evening
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
he
had
aged
materially
.
<EOS>
Years
do
not
make
a
man
old
gradually
and
at
an
even
pace
.
<EOS>
Look
through
the
world
and
see
if
this
is
not
so
always
,
except
in
those
rare
cases
in
which
the
human
being
lives
and
dies
without
joys
and
without
sorrows
,
like
a
vegetable
.
<EOS>
A
man
shall
be
possessed
of
florid
,
youthful
blooming
health
till
<EOS>
,
it
matters
not
what
age
 
<EOS>
thirty
;
forty
;
<EOS>
fifty
 
then
comes
some
nipping
frost
,
some
period
of
agony
,
that
robs
the
fibres
of
the
body
of
their
succulence
,
and
the
hale
and
hearty
man
is
counted
among
the
old
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
down
and
breakfasted
alone
;
Mrs.
Proudie
,
being
indisposed
,
took
her
coffee
in
her
bedroom
,
and
her
daughters
waited
upon
her
there
.
<EOS>
He
ate
his
breakfast
alone
,
and
then
,
hardly
knowing
what
he
did
,
he
betook
himself
to
his
usual
seat
in
his
study
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
solace
himself
with
his
coming
visit
to
the
archbishop
.
<EOS>
That
effort
of
his
own
free
will
at
any
rate
remained
to
him
as
an
enduring
triumph
.
<EOS>
But
somehow
,
now
that
he
had
achieved
it
,
he
did
not
seem
to
care
so
much
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
ambition
that
had
prompted
him
to
take
his
place
at
the
archiepiscopal
table
,
and
his
ambition
was
now
quite
dead
within
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
thus
seated
when
Mr.
Slope
made
his
appearance
,
with
breathless
impatience
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
the
dean
is
dead
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
heavens
!
"
exclaimed
the
bishop
,
startled
out
of
his
apathy
by
an
announcement
so
sad
and
so
sudden
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
either
dead
or
now
dying
.
<EOS>
He
has
had
an
apoplectic
fit
,
and
I
am
told
that
there
is
not
the
slightest
hope
;
indeed
,
I
do
not
doubt
that
by
this
time
he
is
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bells
were
rung
,
and
servants
were
immediately
sent
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
morning
the
bishop
,
leaning
on
his
chaplain
's
arm
,
himself
called
at
the
deanery
door
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
sent
to
Miss
Trefoil
all
manner
of
offers
of
assistance
.
<EOS>
The
Misses
Proudie
sent
also
,
and
there
was
immense
sympathy
between
the
palace
and
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
The
answer
to
all
inquiries
was
unvaried
.
<EOS>
The
dean
was
just
the
same
,
and
Sir
Omicron
Pie
was
expected
down
by
the
9.15
P.M.
train
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
Mr.
Slope
began
to
meditate
,
as
others
also
had
done
,
as
to
who
might
possibly
be
the
new
dean
,
and
it
occurred
to
him
,
as
it
had
also
occurred
to
others
,
that
it
might
be
possible
that
he
should
be
the
new
dean
himself
.
<EOS>
And
then
the
question
as
to
the
twelve
hundred
,
or
fifteen
hundred
,
or
two
thousand
ran
in
his
mind
,
as
it
had
run
through
those
of
the
other
clergymen
in
the
cathedral
library
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
it
might
be
two
thousand
,
or
fifteen
,
or
twelve
hundred
,
it
would
in
any
case
undoubtedly
be
a
great
thing
for
him
,
if
he
could
get
it
.
<EOS>
The
gratification
to
his
ambition
would
be
greater
even
than
that
of
his
covetousness
.
<EOS>
How
glorious
to
out
-
top
the
archdeacon
in
his
own
cathedral
city
;
to
sit
above
prebendaries
and
canons
and
have
the
cathedral
pulpit
and
all
the
cathedral
services
altogether
at
his
own
disposal
!
  
<EOS>
But
it
might
be
easier
to
wish
for
this
than
to
obtain
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
however
,
was
not
without
some
means
of
forwarding
his
views
,
and
he
at
any
rate
did
not
let
the
grass
grow
under
his
feet
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
he
thought
 
and
not
vainly
 
that
he
could
count
upon
what
assistance
the
bishop
could
give
him
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
changed
his
views
with
regard
to
his
patron
;
he
made
up
his
mind
that
if
he
became
dean
,
he
would
hand
his
lordship
back
again
to
his
wife
's
vassalage
;
and
he
thought
it
possible
that
his
lordship
might
not
be
sorry
to
rid
himself
of
one
of
his
mentors
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
also
taken
some
steps
towards
making
his
name
known
to
other
men
in
power
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
certain
chief
-
commissioner
of
national
schools
,
who
at
the
present
moment
was
presumed
to
stand
especially
high
in
the
good
graces
of
the
government
bigwigs
,
and
with
him
Mr.
Slope
had
contrived
to
establish
a
sort
of
epistolary
intimacy
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
he
might
safely
apply
to
Sir
Nicholas
Fitzwhiggin
,
and
he
felt
sure
that
if
Sir
Nicholas
chose
to
exert
himself
,
the
promise
of
such
a
piece
of
preferment
would
be
had
for
the
asking
.
  
<EOS>
Then
he
also
had
the
press
at
his
bidding
,
or
flattered
himself
that
he
had
so
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Daily
Jupiter
"
had
taken
his
part
in
a
very
thorough
manner
in
those
polemical
contests
of
his
with
Mr.
Arabin
;
he
had
on
more
than
one
occasion
absolutely
had
an
interview
with
a
gentleman
on
the
staff
of
that
paper
who
,
if
not
the
editor
,
was
as
good
as
the
editor
;
and
he
had
long
been
in
the
habit
of
writing
telling
letters
on
all
manner
of
ecclesiastical
abuses
,
which
he
signed
with
his
initials
,
and
sent
to
his
editorial
friend
with
private
notes
signed
in
his
own
name
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
and
Mr.
Towers
 
such
was
the
name
of
the
powerful
gentleman
of
the
press
with
whom
he
was
connected
 
were
generally
very
amiable
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
's
little
productions
were
always
printed
and
occasionally
commented
upon
;
and
thus
,
in
a
small
sort
of
way
,
he
had
become
a
literary
celebrity
.
<EOS>
This
public
life
had
great
charms
for
him
,
though
it
certainly
also
had
its
drawbacks
.
<EOS>
On
one
occasion
,
when
speaking
in
the
presence
of
reporters
,
he
had
failed
to
uphold
and
praise
and
swear
by
that
special
line
of
conduct
which
had
been
upheld
and
praised
and
sworn
by
in
"
The
Jupiter
,
"
and
then
he
had
been
much
surprised
and
at
the
moment
not
a
little
irritated
to
find
himself
lacerated
most
unmercifully
by
his
old
ally
.
<EOS>
He
was
quizzed
and
bespattered
and
made
a
fool
of
,
just
as
though
,
or
rather
worse
than
if
,
he
had
been
a
constant
enemy
instead
of
a
constant
friend
.
<EOS>
He
had
hitherto
not
learnt
that
a
man
who
aspires
to
be
on
the
staff
of
"
The
Jupiter
"
must
surrender
all
individuality
.
<EOS>
But
ultimately
this
little
castigation
had
broken
no
bones
between
him
and
his
friend
Mr.
Towers
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
was
one
of
those
who
understood
the
world
too
well
to
show
himself
angry
with
such
a
potentate
as
"
The
Jupiter
.
<EOS>
"
He
had
kissed
the
rod
that
scourged
him
,
and
now
thought
that
he
might
fairly
look
for
his
reward
.
<EOS>
He
determined
that
he
would
at
once
let
Mr.
Towers
know
that
he
was
a
candidate
for
the
place
which
was
about
to
become
vacant
.
<EOS>
More
than
one
piece
of
preferment
had
lately
been
given
away
much
in
accordance
with
advice
tendered
to
the
government
in
the
columns
of
"
The
Jupiter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
incumbent
on
Mr.
Slope
first
to
secure
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
He
specially
felt
that
it
behoved
him
to
do
this
before
the
visit
to
the
archbishop
was
made
.
<EOS>
It
was
really
quite
providential
that
the
dean
should
have
fallen
ill
just
at
the
very
nick
of
time
.
<EOS>
If
Dr.
Proudie
could
be
instigated
to
take
the
matter
up
warmly
,
he
might
manage
a
good
deal
while
staying
at
the
archbishop
's
palace
.
<EOS>
Feeling
this
very
strongly
,
Mr.
Slope
determined
to
sound
the
bishop
that
very
afternoon
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
start
on
the
following
morning
to
London
,
and
therefore
not
a
moment
could
be
lost
with
safety
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
into
the
bishop
's
study
about
five
o'clock
and
found
him
still
sitting
alone
.
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
supposed
that
he
had
hardly
moved
since
the
little
excitement
occasioned
by
his
walk
to
the
dean
's
door
.
<EOS>
He
still
wore
on
his
face
that
dull
,
dead
look
of
half
-
unconscious
suffering
.
<EOS>
He
was
doing
nothing
,
reading
nothing
,
thinking
of
nothing
,
but
simply
gazing
on
vacancy
when
Mr.
Slope
for
the
second
time
that
day
entered
his
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Slope
,
"
said
he
somewhat
impatiently
,
for
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
he
was
not
anxious
just
at
present
to
have
much
conversation
with
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
lordship
will
be
sorry
to
hear
that
as
yet
the
poor
dean
has
shown
no
sign
of
amendment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
 
ah
 
has
n't
he
?
<EOS>
Poor
man
!
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
'm
very
sorry
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Sir
Omicron
has
not
arrived
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
till
the
9.15
P.M.
train
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
they
did
n't
have
a
special
.
<EOS>
They
say
Dr.
Trefoil
is
very
rich
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
rich
,
I
believe
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
But
the
truth
is
,
all
the
doctors
in
London
can
do
no
good
 
<EOS>
no
other
good
than
to
show
that
every
possible
care
has
been
taken
.
<EOS>
Poor
Dr.
Trefoil
is
not
long
for
this
world
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
 
I
suppose
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
;
indeed
,
his
best
friends
could
not
wish
that
he
should
outlive
such
a
shock
,
for
his
intellects
can
not
possibly
survive
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
man
!
<EOS>
Poor
man
!
"
said
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
naturally
be
a
matter
of
much
moment
to
your
lordship
who
is
to
succeed
him
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
great
thing
if
you
could
secure
the
appointment
for
some
person
of
your
own
way
of
thinking
on
important
points
.
<EOS>
The
party
hostile
to
us
are
very
strong
here
in
Barchester
 
much
too
strong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
.
<EOS>
If
poor
Dr.
Trefoil
is
to
go
,
it
will
be
a
great
thing
to
get
a
good
man
in
his
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
everything
to
your
lordship
to
get
a
man
on
whose
co
-
operation
you
can
reckon
.
<EOS>
Only
think
what
trouble
we
might
have
<EOS>
if
Dr.
Grantly
,
or
Dr.
Hyandry
,
or
any
of
that
way
of
thinking
were
to
get
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
very
probable
that
Lord
 
---
will
give
it
to
any
of
that
school
;
why
should
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
Not
probable
;
certainly
not
;
but
it
's
possible
.
<EOS>
Great
interest
will
probably
be
made
.
<EOS>
If
I
might
venture
to
advise
your
lordship
,
I
would
suggest
that
you
should
discuss
the
matter
with
his
grace
next
week
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
that
your
wishes
,
if
made
known
and
backed
by
his
grace
,
would
be
paramount
with
Lord

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
that
;
Lord
 
---
has
always
been
very
kind
to
me
,
very
kind
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
unwilling
to
interfere
in
such
matters
unless
asked
.
<EOS>
And
indeed
if
asked
,
I
do
n't
know
whom
,
at
this
moment
,
I
should
recommend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
even
Mr.
Slope
,
felt
at
the
present
rather
abashed
.
<EOS>
He
hardly
knew
how
to
frame
his
little
request
in
language
sufficiently
modest
.
<EOS>
He
had
recognized
and
acknowledged
to
himself
the
necessity
of
shocking
the
bishop
in
the
first
instance
by
the
temerity
of
his
application
,
and
his
difficulty
was
how
best
to
remedy
that
by
his
adroitness
and
eloquence
.
<EOS>
"
I
doubted
myself
,
"
said
he
,
"
whether
your
lordship
would
have
anyone
immediately
in
your
eye
,
and
it
is
on
this
account
that
I
venture
to
submit
to
you
an
idea
that
I
have
been
turning
over
in
my
own
mind
.
<EOS>
If
poor
Dr.
Trefoil
must
go
,
I
really
do
not
see
why
,
with
your
lordship
's
assistance
,
I
should
not
hold
the
preferment
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
You
!
"
exclaimed
the
bishop
in
a
manner
that
Mr.
Slope
could
hardly
have
considered
complimentary
.
  
<EOS>
The
ice
was
now
broken
,
and
Mr.
Slope
became
fluent
enough
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
thinking
of
looking
for
it
.
<EOS>
If
your
lordship
will
press
the
matter
on
the
archbishop
,
I
do
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
I
shall
succeed
.
<EOS>
You
see
I
shall
be
the
first
to
move
,
which
is
a
great
matter
.
<EOS>
Then
I
can
count
upon
assistance
from
the
public
press
:
<EOS>
my
name
is
known
,
I
may
say
,
somewhat
favourably
known
,
to
that
portion
of
the
press
which
is
now
most
influential
with
the
government
;
and
I
have
friends
also
in
the
government
.
<EOS>
But
nevertheless
it
is
to
you
,
my
lord
,
that
I
look
for
assistance
.
<EOS>
It
is
from
your
hands
that
I
would
most
willingly
receive
the
benefit
.
<EOS>
And
,
which
should
ever
be
the
chief
consideration
in
such
matters
<EOS>
,
you
must
know
better
than
any
other
person
whatsoever
what
qualifications
I
possess
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
sat
for
awhile
dumbfounded
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
Dean
of
Barchester
!
<EOS>
The
idea
of
such
a
transformation
of
character
would
never
have
occurred
to
his
own
unaided
intellect
.
<EOS>
At
first
he
went
on
thinking
why
,
for
what
reasons
,
on
what
account
,
Mr.
Slope
should
be
Dean
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
But
by
degrees
the
direction
of
his
thoughts
changed
,
and
he
began
to
think
why
,
for
what
reasons
,
on
what
account
,
Mr.
Slope
should
not
be
Dean
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
he
himself
,
the
bishop
,
was
concerned
,
he
could
well
spare
the
services
of
his
chaplain
.
<EOS>
That
little
idea
of
using
Mr.
Slope
as
a
counterpoise
to
his
wife
had
well
nigh
evaporated
.
<EOS>
He
had
all
but
acknowledged
the
futility
of
the
scheme
.
<EOS>
If
indeed
he
could
have
slept
in
his
chaplain
's
bedroom
instead
of
his
wife
's
,
there
might
have
been
something
in
it
.
<EOS>
But
 
.
<EOS>
And
thus
as
Mr.
Slope
was
speaking
,
the
bishop
began
to
recognize
the
idea
that
that
gentleman
might
become
Dean
of
Barchester
without
impropriety
 
not
moved
,
indeed
,
by
Mr.
Slope
's
eloquence
,
for
he
did
not
follow
the
tenor
of
his
speech
,
but
led
thereto
by
his
own
cogitations
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
say
,
"
continued
Mr.
Slope
,
"
that
it
would
be
my
chief
desire
to
act
in
all
matters
connected
with
the
cathedral
as
far
as
possible
in
accordance
with
your
views
.
<EOS>
I
know
your
lordship
so
well
<EOS>
(
and
I
hope
you
know
me
<EOS>
well
enough
to
have
the
same
feelings
)
<EOS>
that
I
am
satisfied
that
my
being
in
that
position
would
add
materially
to
your
own
comfort
,
and
enable
you
to
extend
the
sphere
of
your
useful
influence
.
<EOS>
As
I
said
before
,
it
is
most
desirable
that
there
should
be
but
one
opinion
among
the
dignitaries
of
the
same
diocese
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
much
whether
I
would
accept
such
an
appointment
in
any
diocese
in
which
I
should
be
constrained
to
differ
much
from
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
In
this
case
there
would
be
a
delightful
uniformity
of
opinion
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
perfectly
well
perceived
that
the
bishop
did
not
follow
a
word
that
he
said
,
but
nevertheless
he
went
on
talking
.
<EOS>
He
knew
it
was
necessary
that
Dr.
Proudie
should
recover
from
his
surprise
,
and
he
knew
also
that
he
must
give
him
the
opportunity
of
appearing
to
have
been
persuaded
by
argument
.
<EOS>
So
he
went
on
and
produced
a
multitude
of
fitting
reasons
all
tending
to
show
that
no
one
on
earth
could
make
so
good
a
Dean
of
Barchester
as
himself
,
that
the
government
and
the
public
would
assuredly
coincide
in
desiring
that
he
,
Mr.
Slope
,
should
be
Dean
of
Barchester
,
but
that
for
high
considerations
of
ecclesiastical
polity
it
would
be
especially
desirable
that
this
piece
of
preferment
should
be
so
bestowed
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
bishop
of
the
diocese
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
really
do
n't
know
what
I
could
do
in
the
matter
,
"
said
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
would
mention
it
to
the
archbishop
;
if
you
could
tell
his
grace
that
you
consider
such
an
appointment
very
desirable
,
that
you
have
it
much
at
heart
with
a
view
to
putting
an
end
to
schism
in
the
diocese
;
if
you
did
this
with
your
usual
energy
,
you
would
probably
find
no
difficulty
in
inducing
his
grace
to
promise
that
he
would
mention
it
to
Lord
 
---
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
would
let
the
archbishop
know
that
I
am
not
looking
for
the
preferment
solely
through
his
intervention
;
that
you
do
not
exactly
require
him
to
ask
it
as
a
favour
;
that
you
expect
that
I
shall
get
it
through
other
sources
,
as
is
indeed
the
case
;
but
that
you
are
very
anxious
that
his
grace
should
express
his
approval
of
such
an
arrangement
to
Lord
 
---
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
ended
in
the
bishop
promising
to
do
as
he
was
bid
.
<EOS>
Not
that
he
so
promised
without
a
stipulation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
About
that
hospital
,
"
he
said
in
the
middle
of
the
conference
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
never
so
troubled
in
my
life
"
 
which
was
about
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
spoken
to
Mr.
Harding
since
I
saw
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
assured
his
patron
that
he
had
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
well
,
then
 
I
think
upon
the
whole
it
will
be
better
to
let
Quiverful
have
it
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
half
-
promised
to
him
,
and
he
has
a
large
family
and
is
very
poor
.
<EOS>
I
think
on
the
whole
it
will
be
better
to
make
out
the
nomination
for
Mr.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
still
thinking
that
he
was
bound
to
make
a
fight
for
his
own
view
on
this
matter
,
and
remembering
that
it
still
behoved
him
to
maintain
his
lately
acquired
supremacy
over
Mrs.
Proudie
,
lest
he
should
fail
in
his
views
regarding
the
deanery
,
"
but
,
my
lord
,
I
am
really
much
afraid
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Remember
,
Mr.
Slope
,
"
said
the
bishop
,
"
I
can
hold
out
no
sort
of
hope
to
you
in
this
matter
of
succeeding
poor
Dr.
Trefoil
.
<EOS>
I
will
certainly
speak
to
the
archbishop
,
as
you
wish
it
,
but
I
can
not
think
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
fully
understanding
the
bishop
and
in
his
turn
interrupting
him
,
"
perhaps
your
lordship
is
right
about
Mr.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
I
can
easily
arrange
matters
with
Mr.
Harding
,
and
I
will
make
out
the
nomination
for
your
signature
as
you
direct
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Slope
,
I
think
that
will
be
best
;
and
you
may
be
sure
that
any
little
that
I
can
do
to
forward
your
views
shall
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
they
parted
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
now
much
business
on
his
hands
.
<EOS>
He
had
to
make
his
daily
visit
to
the
signora
.
<EOS>
This
common
prudence
should
have
now
induced
him
to
omit
,
but
he
was
infatuated
,
and
could
not
bring
himself
to
be
commonly
prudent
.
<EOS>
He
determined
therefore
that
he
would
drink
tea
at
the
Stanhopes
"
,
and
he
determined
also
,
or
thought
that
he
determined
,
that
having
done
so
he
would
go
thither
no
more
.
<EOS>
He
had
also
to
arrange
his
matters
with
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
He
was
of
opinion
that
Eleanor
would
grace
the
deanery
as
perfectly
as
she
would
the
chaplain
's
cottage
,
and
he
thought
,
moreover
,
that
Eleanor
's
fortune
would
excellently
repair
any
dilapidations
and
curtailments
in
the
dean
's
stipend
which
might
have
been
made
by
that
ruthless
ecclesiastical
commission
.
  
<EOS>
Touching
Mrs.
Bold
his
hopes
now
soared
high
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
was
one
of
that
numerous
multitude
of
swains
who
think
that
all
is
fair
in
love
,
and
he
had
accordingly
not
refrained
from
using
the
services
of
Mrs.
Bold
's
own
maid
.
<EOS>
From
her
he
had
learnt
much
of
what
had
taken
place
at
Plumstead
 
not
exactly
with
truth
,
for
"
<EOS>
the
own
maid
"
had
not
been
able
to
divine
the
exact
truth
,
but
with
some
sort
of
similitude
to
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
told
that
the
archdeacon
and
Mrs.
Grantly
and
Mr.
Harding
and
Mr.
Arabin
had
all
quarrelled
with
"
missus
"
for
having
received
a
letter
from
Mr.
Slope
;
that
"
missus
"
had
positively
refused
to
give
the
letter
up
;
that
she
had
received
from
the
archdeacon
the
option
of
giving
up
either
Mr.
Slope
and
his
letter
,
or
else
the
society
of
Plumstead
Rectory
;
and
that
"
missus
"
had
declared
,
with
much
indignation
,
that
"
she
did
n't
care
a
straw
for
the
society
of
Plumstead
Rectory
,
"
and
that
she
would
n't
give
up
Mr.
Slope
for
any
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
Considering
the
source
from
whence
this
came
,
it
was
not
quite
so
untrue
as
might
have
been
expected
.
<EOS>
It
showed
pretty
plainly
what
had
been
the
nature
of
the
conversation
in
the
servants
"
hall
;
and
,
coupled
as
it
was
with
the
certainty
of
Eleanor
's
sudden
return
,
it
appeared
to
Mr.
Slope
to
be
so
far
worthy
of
credit
as
to
justify
him
in
thinking
that
the
fair
widow
would
in
all
human
probability
accept
his
offer
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
work
was
therefore
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
It
was
desirable
,
he
thought
,
that
he
should
make
his
offer
before
it
was
known
that
Mr.
Quiverful
was
finally
appointed
to
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
In
his
letter
to
Eleanor
he
had
plainly
declared
that
Mr.
Harding
was
to
have
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
very
difficult
to
explain
this
away
,
and
were
he
to
write
another
letter
to
Eleanor
,
telling
the
truth
and
throwing
the
blame
on
the
bishop
,
it
would
naturally
injure
him
in
her
estimation
.
<EOS>
He
determined
therefore
to
let
that
matter
disclose
itself
as
it
would
,
and
to
lose
no
time
in
throwing
himself
at
her
feet
.
  
<EOS>
Then
he
had
to
solicit
the
assistance
of
Sir
Nicholas
Fitzwhiggin
and
Mr.
Towers
,
and
he
went
directly
from
the
bishop
's
presence
to
compose
his
letters
to
those
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
As
Mr.
Slope
was
esteemed
an
adept
at
letter
writing
,
they
shall
be
given
in
full
.

MY
DEAR
SIR
NICHOLAS
,
  
<EOS>
I
hope
that
the
intercourse
which
has
been
between
us
will
preclude
you
from
regarding
my
present
application
as
an
intrusion
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
,
I
imagine
,
have
yet
heard
that
poor
old
Dr.
Trefoil
has
been
seized
with
apoplexy
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
subject
of
profound
grief
to
everyone
in
Barchester
,
for
he
has
always
been
an
excellent
man
 
excellent
as
a
man
and
as
a
clergyman
.
<EOS>
He
is
,
however
,
full
of
years
,
and
his
life
could
not
under
any
circumstances
have
been
much
longer
spared
.
<EOS>
You
may
probably
have
known
him
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
,
it
appears
,
no
probable
chance
of
his
recovery
.
<EOS>
Sir
Omicron
Pie
is
,
I
believe
,
at
present
with
him
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
the
medical
men
here
have
declared
that
one
or
two
days
more
must
limit
the
tether
of
his
mortal
coil
.
<EOS>
I
sincerely
trust
that
his
soul
may
wing
its
flight
to
that
haven
where
it
may
forever
be
at
rest
and
forever
be
happy
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
has
been
speaking
to
me
about
the
preferment
,
and
he
is
anxious
that
it
should
be
conferred
on
me
.
<EOS>
I
confess
that
I
can
hardly
venture
,
at
my
age
,
to
look
for
such
advancement
,
but
I
am
so
far
encouraged
by
his
lordship
that
I
believe
I
shall
be
induced
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
goes
to
 
---
to
-
morrow
and
is
intent
on
mentioning
the
subject
to
the
archbishop
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
well
how
deservedly
great
is
your
weight
with
the
present
government
.
<EOS>
In
any
matter
touching
church
preferment
you
would
of
course
be
listened
to
.
<EOS>
Now
that
the
matter
has
been
put
into
my
head
,
I
am
of
course
anxious
to
be
successful
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
assist
me
by
your
good
word
,
you
will
confer
on
me
one
additional
favour
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
better
add
,
that
Lord
 
---
can
not
as
yet
know
of
this
piece
of
preferment
having
fallen
in
,
or
rather
of
its
certainty
of
falling
(
for
poor
dear
<EOS>
Dr.
Trefoil
is
past
hope
)
.
<EOS>
Should
Lord
 
---
first
hear
it
from
you
,
that
might
probably
be
thought
to
give
you
a
fair
claim
to
express
your
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
our
grand
object
is
that
we
should
all
be
of
one
opinion
in
church
matters
.
<EOS>
This
is
most
desirable
at
Barchester
;
it
is
this
that
makes
our
good
bishop
so
anxious
about
it
.
<EOS>
You
may
probably
think
it
expedient
to
point
this
out
to
Lord
 
---
if
it
shall
be
in
your
power
to
oblige
me
by
mentioning
the
subject
to
his
lordship
.
  
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
My
dear
Sir
Nicholas
,
Your
most
faithful
servant
,
  
OBADIAH
SLOPE
  
<EOS>
His
letter
to
Mr.
Towers
was
written
in
quite
a
different
strain
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
conceived
that
he
completely
understood
the
difference
in
character
and
position
of
the
two
men
whom
he
addressed
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
for
such
a
man
as
Sir
Nicholas
Fitzwhiggin
a
little
flummery
was
necessary
,
and
that
it
might
be
of
the
easy
,
everyday
description
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
his
letter
to
Sir
Nicholas
was
written
,
_
currente
calamo
_
,
with
very
little
trouble
.
<EOS>
But
to
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Towers
it
was
not
so
easy
to
write
a
letter
that
should
be
effective
and
yet
not
offensive
,
that
should
carry
its
point
without
undue
interference
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
difficult
to
flatter
Dr.
Proudie
or
Sir
Nicholas
Fitzwhiggin
,
but
very
difficult
to
flatter
Mr.
Towers
without
letting
the
flattery
declare
itself
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
had
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
this
letter
must
,
in
appearance
at
least
,
be
written
without
effort
,
and
be
fluent
,
unconstrained
,
and
demonstrative
of
no
doubt
or
fear
on
the
part
of
the
writer
.
<EOS>
Therefore
the
epistle
to
Mr.
Towers
was
studied
,
and
re
-
copied
,
and
elaborated
at
the
cost
of
so
many
minutes
that
Mr.
Slope
had
hardly
time
to
dress
himself
and
reach
Dr.
Stanhope
's
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
When
dispatched
,
it
ran
as
follows
:
    
(
Private

<EOS>
Barchester
.
<EOS>
Sept.
185
    
(
He
purposely
omitted
any
allusion
to
the
"
palace
,
"
thinking
that
Mr.
Towers
might
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
A
great
man
,
he
remembered
,
had
been
once
much
condemned
for
dating
a
letter
from
Windsor
Castle

<EOS>
MY
DEAR
SIR
,
  
<EOS>
We
were
all
a
good
deal
shocked
here
this
morning
by
hearing
that
poor
old
Dean
Trefoil
had
been
stricken
with
apoplexy
.
<EOS>
The
fit
took
him
about
9
A.M.
I
am
writing
now
to
save
the
post
,
and
he
is
still
alive
,
but
past
all
hope
or
possibility
,
I
believe
,
of
living
.
<EOS>
Sir
Omicron
Pie
is
here
,
or
will
be
very
shortly
,
but
all
that
even
Sir
Omicron
can
do
is
to
ratify
the
sentence
of
his
less
distinguished
brethren
that
nothing
can
be
done
.
<EOS>
Poor
Dr.
Trefoil
's
race
on
this
side
the
grave
is
run
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
you
knew
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
good
,
quiet
,
charitable
man
,
of
the
old
school
,
of
course
,
as
any
clergyman
over
seventy
years
of
age
must
necessarily
be
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
do
not
write
merely
with
the
object
of
sending
you
such
news
as
this
:
<EOS>
doubtless
someone
of
your
Mercuries
will
have
seen
and
heard
and
reported
so
much
;
I
write
,
as
you
usually
do
yourself
,
rather
with
a
view
to
the
future
than
to
the
past
.
  
<EOS>
Rumour
is
already
rife
here
as
to
Dr.
Trefoil
's
successor
,
and
among
those
named
as
possible
future
deans
your
humble
servant
is
,
I
believe
,
not
the
least
frequently
spoken
of
;
in
short
,
I
am
looking
for
the
preferment
.
<EOS>
You
may
probably
know
that
since
Bishop
Proudie
came
to
the
diocese
I
have
exerted
myself
here
a
good
deal
<EOS>
and
,
I
may
certainly
say
,
not
without
some
success
.
<EOS>
He
and
I
are
nearly
always
of
the
same
opinion
on
points
of
doctrine
as
well
as
church
discipline
,
and
therefore
I
have
had
,
as
his
confidential
chaplain
,
very
much
in
my
own
hands
;
but
I
confess
to
you
that
I
have
a
higher
ambition
than
to
remain
the
chaplain
of
any
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
no
positions
in
which
more
energy
is
now
needed
than
those
of
our
deans
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
our
enormous
cathedral
establishments
have
been
allowed
to
go
to
sleep
 
<EOS>
nay
,
they
are
all
but
dead
and
ready
for
the
sepulchre
!
<EOS>
And
yet
of
what
prodigious
moment
they
might
be
made
if
,
as
was
intended
,
they
were
so
managed
as
to
lead
the
way
and
show
an
example
for
all
our
parochial
clergy
!
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
here
is
most
anxious
for
my
success
;
indeed
,
he
goes
to
-
morrow
to
press
the
matter
on
the
archbishop
.
<EOS>
I
believe
also
I
may
count
on
the
support
of
at
least
one
most
effective
member
of
the
government
.
<EOS>
But
I
confess
that
the
support
of
"
The
Jupiter
,
"
if
I
be
thought
worthy
of
it
,
would
be
more
gratifying
to
me
than
any
other
;
more
gratifying
if
by
it
I
should
be
successful
,
and
more
gratifying
also
<EOS>
if
,
although
so
supported
,
I
should
be
unsuccessful
.
  
<EOS>
The
time
has
,
in
fact
,
come
in
which
no
government
can
venture
to
fill
up
the
high
places
of
the
Church
in
defiance
of
the
public
press
.
<EOS>
The
age
of
honourable
bishops
and
noble
deans
has
gone
by
,
and
any
clergyman
however
humbly
born
<EOS>
can
now
hope
for
success
if
his
industry
,
talent
,
and
character
be
sufficient
to
call
forth
the
manifest
opinion
of
the
public
in
his
favour
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
present
moment
we
all
feel
that
any
counsel
given
in
such
matters
by
"
The
Jupiter
"
has
the
greatest
weight
 
is
,
indeed
,
generally
followed
;
and
we
feel
also
 
I
am
speaking
of
clergymen
of
my
own
age
and
standing
 
that
it
should
be
so
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
patron
less
interested
than
"
The
Jupiter
,
"
and
none
that
more
thoroughly
understands
the
wants
of
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
will
not
suspect
me
of
asking
from
you
any
support
which
the
paper
with
which
you
are
connected
can
not
conscientiously
give
me
.
<EOS>
My
object
in
writing
is
to
let
you
know
that
I
am
a
candidate
for
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
It
is
for
you
to
judge
whether
or
no
you
can
assist
my
views
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
,
of
course
,
have
written
to
you
on
such
a
matter
<EOS>
had
I
not
believed
(
and
I
have
had
good
reason
so
to
believe
)
that
"
The
Jupiter
"
approves
of
my
views
on
ecclesiastical
polity
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
expresses
a
fear
that
I
may
be
considered
too
young
for
such
a
station
,
my
age
being
thirty
-
six
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
that
at
the
present
day
any
hesitation
need
be
felt
on
such
a
point
.
<EOS>
The
public
has
lost
its
love
for
antiquated
servants
.
<EOS>
If
a
man
will
ever
be
fit
to
do
good
work
,
he
will
be
fit
at
thirty
-
six
years
of
age
.
  
<EOS>
Believe
me
very
faithfully
yours

OBADIAH

Temple

<EOS>
Having
thus
exerted
himself
,
Mr.
Slope
posted
his
letters
and
passed
the
remainder
of
the
evening
at
the
feet
of
his
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
will
be
accused
of
deceit
in
his
mode
of
canvassing
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
said
that
he
lied
in
the
application
he
made
to
each
of
his
three
patrons
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
must
be
owned
that
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
hesitate
on
account
of
his
youth
and
yet
be
quite
assured
that
he
was
not
too
young
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
count
chiefly
on
the
bishop
's
support
and
chiefly
also
on
that
of
the
newspaper
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
think
that
the
bishop
was
going
to
 
---
to
press
the
matter
on
the
archbishop
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
owned
that
in
his
canvassing
Mr.
Slope
was
as
false
as
he
well
could
be
.
  
<EOS>
Let
it
,
however
,
be
asked
of
those
who
are
conversant
with
such
matters
,
whether
he
was
more
false
than
men
usually
are
on
such
occasions
.
<EOS>
We
English
gentlemen
hate
the
name
of
a
lie
,
but
how
often
do
we
find
public
men
who
believe
each
other
's
words
?
   
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
Victrix
 
<EOS>
The
next
week
passed
over
at
Barchester
with
much
apparent
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
The
hearts
,
however
,
of
some
of
the
inhabitants
were
not
so
tranquil
as
the
streets
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
The
poor
old
dean
still
continued
to
live
,
just
as
Sir
Omicron
Pie
had
prophesied
that
he
would
do
,
much
to
the
amazement
,
and
some
thought
disgust
,
of
Dr.
Fillgrave
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
still
remained
away
.
<EOS>
He
had
stayed
a
day
or
two
in
town
and
had
also
remained
longer
at
the
archbishop
's
than
he
had
intended
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
as
yet
received
no
line
in
answer
to
either
of
his
letters
,
but
he
had
learnt
the
cause
of
this
.
<EOS>
Sir
Nicholas
was
stalking
a
deer
,
or
attending
the
Queen
,
in
the
Highlands
,
and
even
the
indefatigable
Mr.
Towers
had
stolen
an
autumn
holiday
,
and
had
made
one
of
the
yearly
tribe
who
now
ascend
Mont
Blanc
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
learnt
that
he
was
not
expected
back
till
the
last
day
of
September
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
was
thrown
much
with
the
Stanhopes
,
of
whom
she
became
fonder
and
fonder
.
<EOS>
If
asked
,
she
would
have
said
that
Charlotte
Stanhope
was
her
especial
friend
,
and
so
she
would
have
thought
.
<EOS>
But
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
she
liked
Bertie
nearly
as
well
;
she
had
no
more
idea
of
regarding
him
as
a
lover
than
she
would
have
had
of
looking
at
a
big
tame
dog
in
such
a
light
.
<EOS>
Bertie
had
become
very
intimate
with
her
,
and
made
little
speeches
to
her
,
and
said
little
things
of
a
sort
very
different
from
the
speeches
and
sayings
of
other
men
.
<EOS>
But
then
this
was
almost
always
done
before
his
sisters
;
and
he
,
with
his
long
silken
beard
,
his
light
blue
eyes
,
and
strange
dress
,
was
so
unlike
other
men
.
<EOS>
She
admitted
him
to
a
kind
of
familiarity
which
she
had
never
known
with
anyone
else
,
and
of
which
she
by
no
means
understood
the
danger
.
<EOS>
She
blushed
once
at
finding
that
she
had
called
him
Bertie
and
,
on
the
same
day
,
only
barely
remembered
her
position
in
time
to
check
herself
from
playing
upon
him
some
personal
practical
joke
to
which
she
was
instigated
by
Charlotte
.
  
<EOS>
In
all
this
Eleanor
was
perfectly
innocent
,
and
Bertie
Stanhope
could
hardly
be
called
guilty
.
<EOS>
But
every
familiarity
into
which
Eleanor
was
entrapped
was
deliberately
planned
by
his
sister
.
<EOS>
She
knew
well
how
to
play
her
game
,
and
played
it
without
mercy
;
she
knew
,
none
<EOS>
so
well
,
what
was
her
brother
's
character
,
and
she
would
have
handed
over
to
him
the
young
widow
,
and
the
young
widow
's
money
,
and
the
money
of
the
widow
's
child
,
without
remorse
.
<EOS>
With
her
pretended
friendship
and
warm
cordiality
,
she
strove
to
connect
Eleanor
so
closely
with
her
brother
as
to
make
it
impossible
that
she
should
go
back
even
if
she
wished
it
.
<EOS>
But
Charlotte
Stanhope
knew
really
nothing
of
Eleanor
's
character
,
did
not
even
understand
that
there
were
such
characters
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
comprehend
that
a
young
and
pretty
woman
could
be
playful
and
familiar
with
a
man
such
as
Bertie
Stanhope
and
yet
have
no
idea
in
her
head
,
<EOS>
no
feeling
in
her
heart
,
that
she
would
have
been
ashamed
to
own
to
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
Stanhope
did
not
in
the
least
conceive
that
her
new
friend
was
a
woman
whom
nothing
could
entrap
into
an
inconsiderate
marriage
,
whose
mind
would
have
revolted
from
the
slightest
impropriety
<EOS>
had
she
been
aware
that
any
impropriety
existed
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Stanhope
,
however
,
had
tact
enough
to
make
herself
and
her
father
's
house
very
agreeable
to
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
There
was
with
them
all
an
absence
of
stiffness
and
formality
which
was
peculiarly
agreeable
to
Eleanor
after
the
great
dose
of
clerical
arrogance
which
she
had
lately
been
constrained
to
take
.
<EOS>
She
played
chess
with
them
,
walked
with
them
,
and
drank
tea
with
them
;
studied
or
pretended
to
study
astronomy
;
assisted
them
in
writing
stories
in
rhyme
,
in
turning
prose
tragedy
into
comic
verse
,
or
comic
stories
into
would
-
be
tragic
poetry
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
idea
before
that
she
had
any
such
talents
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
conceived
the
possibility
of
her
doing
such
things
as
she
now
did
.
<EOS>
She
found
with
the
Stanhopes
new
amusements
and
employments
,
new
pursuits
,
which
in
themselves
could
not
be
wrong
,
and
which
were
exceedingly
alluring
.
  
<EOS>
Is
it
not
a
pity
that
people
who
are
bright
and
clever
should
so
often
be
exceedingly
improper
,
and
that
those
who
are
never
improper
should
so
often
be
dull
and
heavy
?
<EOS>
Now
Charlotte
Stanhope
was
always
bright
and
never
heavy
,
but
then
her
propriety
was
doubtful
.
  
<EOS>
But
during
all
this
time
Eleanor
by
no
means
forgot
Mr.
Arabin
,
nor
did
she
forget
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
She
had
parted
from
Mr.
Arabin
in
her
anger
.
<EOS>
She
was
still
angry
at
what
she
regarded
as
his
impertinent
interference
,
but
nevertheless
she
looked
forward
to
meeting
him
again
,
and
also
looked
forward
to
forgiving
him
.
<EOS>
The
words
that
Mr.
Arabin
had
uttered
still
sounded
in
her
ears
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
if
not
intended
for
a
declaration
of
love
,
they
did
signify
that
he
loved
her
,
and
she
felt
also
that
if
he
ever
did
make
such
a
declaration
,
it
might
be
that
she
should
not
receive
it
unkindly
.
<EOS>
She
was
still
angry
with
him
,
very
angry
with
him
;
so
angry
that
she
would
bite
her
lip
and
stamp
her
foot
as
she
thought
of
what
he
had
said
and
done
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
she
yearned
to
let
him
know
that
he
was
forgiven
;
all
that
she
required
was
that
he
should
own
that
he
had
sinned
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
to
meet
him
at
Ullathorne
on
the
last
day
of
the
present
month
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
had
invited
all
the
country
round
to
a
breakfast
on
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
There
were
to
be
tents
,
and
archery
,
and
dancing
for
the
ladies
on
the
lawn
and
for
the
swains
and
girls
in
the
paddock
.
<EOS>
There
were
to
be
fiddlers
and
fifers
,
races
for
the
boys
,
poles
to
be
climbed
,
ditches
full
of
water
to
be
jumped
over
,
horse
-
collars
to
be
grinned
through
(
this
latter
amusement
was
an
addition
of
the
stewards
,
and
not
arranged
by
Miss
Thorne
in
the
original
programme
)
,
and
every
game
to
be
played
which
,
in
a
long
course
of
reading
,
Miss
Thorne
could
ascertain
to
have
been
played
in
the
good
days
of
Queen
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
Everything
of
more
modern
growth
was
to
be
tabooed
,
if
possible
.
<EOS>
On
one
subject
Miss
Thorne
was
very
unhappy
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
turning
in
her
mind
the
matter
of
a
bull
-
ring
,
but
could
not
succeed
in
making
anything
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
for
the
world
have
done
,
or
allowed
to
be
done
,
anything
that
was
cruel
;
as
to
the
promoting
the
torture
of
a
bull
for
the
amusement
of
her
young
neighbours
,
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
Miss
Thorne
would
be
the
last
to
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
yet
there
was
something
so
charming
in
the
name
.
<EOS>
A
bull
-
ring
,
however
,
without
a
bull
would
only
be
a
memento
of
the
decadence
of
the
times
,
and
she
felt
herself
constrained
to
abandon
the
idea
.
<EOS>
Quintains
,
however
,
she
was
determined
to
have
,
and
had
poles
and
swivels
and
bags
of
flour
prepared
accordingly
.
<EOS>
She
would
no
doubt
have
been
anxious
for
something
small
in
the
way
of
a
tournament
,
but
,
as
she
said
to
her
brother
,
that
had
been
tried
,
and
the
age
had
proved
itself
too
decidedly
inferior
to
its
forerunners
to
admit
of
such
a
pastime
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
did
not
seem
to
participate
much
in
her
regret
,
feeling
perhaps
that
a
full
suit
of
chain
-
armour
would
have
added
but
little
to
his
own
personal
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
This
party
at
Ullathorne
had
been
planned
in
the
first
place
as
a
sort
of
welcoming
to
Mr.
Arabin
on
his
entrance
into
St.
Ewold
's
parsonage
;
an
intended
harvest
-
home
gala
for
the
labourers
and
their
wives
and
children
had
subsequently
been
amalgamated
with
it
,
and
thus
it
had
grown
to
its
present
dimensions
.
<EOS>
All
the
Plumstead
party
had
of
course
been
asked
,
and
at
the
time
of
the
invitation
Eleanor
had
intended
to
have
gone
with
her
sister
.
<EOS>
Now
her
plans
were
altered
,
and
she
was
going
with
the
Stanhopes
.
<EOS>
The
Proudies
were
also
to
be
there
,
and
,
as
Mr.
Slope
had
not
been
included
in
the
invitation
to
the
palace
,
the
signora
,
whose
impudence
never
deserted
her
,
asked
permission
of
Miss
Thorne
to
bring
him
.
  
<EOS>
This
permission
Miss
Thorne
gave
,
having
no
other
alternative
;
but
she
did
so
with
a
trembling
heart
,
fearing
Mr.
Arabin
would
be
offended
.
<EOS>
Immediately
on
his
return
she
apologized
,
almost
with
tears
,
so
dire
an
enmity
was
presumed
to
rage
between
the
two
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Arabin
comforted
her
by
an
assurance
that
he
should
meet
Mr.
Slope
with
the
greatest
pleasure
imaginable
and
made
her
promise
that
she
would
introduce
them
to
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
triumph
of
Mr.
Slope
's
was
not
so
agreeable
to
Eleanor
,
who
since
her
return
to
Barchester
had
done
her
best
to
avoid
him
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
give
way
to
the
Plumstead
folk
when
they
so
ungenerously
accused
her
of
being
in
love
with
this
odious
man
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
knowing
that
she
was
so
accused
,
she
was
fully
alive
to
the
expediency
of
keeping
out
of
his
way
and
dropping
him
by
degrees
.
<EOS>
She
had
seen
very
little
of
him
since
her
return
.
<EOS>
Her
servant
had
been
instructed
to
say
to
all
visitors
that
she
was
out
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
specify
Mr.
Slope
particularly
,
and
in
order
to
avoid
him
she
had
thus
debarred
herself
from
all
her
friends
.
<EOS>
She
had
excepted
Charlotte
Stanhope
and
,
by
degrees
,
a
few
others
also
.
<EOS>
Once
she
had
met
him
at
the
Stanhopes
"
,
but
as
a
rule
,
Mr.
Slope
's
visits
there
were
made
in
the
morning
and
hers
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
On
that
one
occasion
Charlotte
had
managed
to
preserve
her
from
any
annoyance
.
<EOS>
This
was
very
good
-
natured
on
the
part
of
Charlotte
,
as
Eleanor
thought
,
and
also
very
sharp
-
witted
,
as
Eleanor
had
told
her
friend
nothing
of
her
reasons
for
wishing
to
avoid
that
gentleman
.
<EOS>
The
fact
,
however
,
was
that
Charlotte
had
learnt
from
her
sister
that
Mr.
Slope
would
probably
put
himself
forward
as
a
suitor
for
the
widow
's
hand
,
and
she
was
consequently
sufficiently
alive
to
the
expediency
of
guarding
Bertie
's
future
wife
from
any
danger
in
that
quarter
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
the
Stanhopes
were
pledged
to
take
Mr.
Slope
with
them
to
Ullathorne
.
<EOS>
An
arrangement
was
therefore
necessarily
made
,
which
was
very
disagreeable
to
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Stanhope
,
with
herself
,
Charlotte
,
and
Mr.
Slope
,
were
to
go
together
,
and
Bertie
was
to
follow
with
his
sister
Madeline
.
<EOS>
It
was
clearly
visible
by
Eleanor
's
face
that
this
assortment
was
very
disagreeable
to
her
,
and
Charlotte
,
who
was
much
encouraged
thereby
in
her
own
little
plan
,
made
a
thousand
apologies
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
do
n't
like
it
,
my
dear
,
"
said
she
,
"
but
we
could
not
manage
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Bertie
would
give
his
eyes
to
go
with
you
,
but
Madeline
can
not
possibly
go
without
him
.
<EOS>
Nor
could
we
possibly
put
Mr.
Slope
and
Madeline
in
the
same
carriage
without
anyone
else
.
<EOS>
They
'd
both
be
ruined
forever
,
you
know
,
and
not
admitted
inside
Ullathorne
gates
,
I
should
imagine
,
after
such
an
impropriety
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
that
would
n't
do
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
"
but
could
n't
I
go
in
the
carriage
with
the
signora
and
your
brother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Impossible
!
"
said
Charlotte
.
<EOS>
"
When
she
is
there
,
there
is
only
room
for
two
.
"
<EOS>
The
Signora
,
in
truth
,
did
not
care
to
do
her
travelling
in
the
presence
of
strangers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
"
you
are
all
so
kind
,
Charlotte
,
and
so
good
to
me
that
I
am
sure
you
wo
n't
be
offended
,
<EOS>
but
I
think
I
'll
not
go
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
go
at
all
!
 
<EOS>
what
nonsense
!
 
<EOS>
indeed
you
shall
.
<EOS>
"
It
had
been
absolutely
determined
in
family
counsel
that
Bertie
should
propose
on
that
very
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Or
I
can
take
a
fly
,
"
said
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
am
not
embarrassed
by
so
many
difficulties
as
you
young
ladies
;
I
can
go
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
think
of
such
a
thing
;
after
all
,
it
is
only
for
an
hour
or
so
;
and
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
you
dislike
so
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
and
Mr.
Slope
were
great
friends
.
<EOS>
What
is
it
you
dislike
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
nothing
particular
,
"
said
Eleanor
;
"
only
I
thought
it
would
be
a
family
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
would
be
much
nicer
,
much
more
snug
,
if
Bertie
could
go
with
us
.
<EOS>
It
is
he
that
is
badly
treated
.
<EOS>
I
can
assure
you
he
is
much
more
afraid
of
Mr.
Slope
than
you
are
.
<EOS>
But
you
see
Madeline
can
not
go
out
without
him
 
and
she
,
poor
creature
,
goes
out
so
seldom
!
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
do
n't
begrudge
her
this
,
though
her
vagary
does
knock
about
our
own
party
a
little
.
"
  
<EOS>
Of
course
Eleanor
made
a
thousand
protestations
and
uttered
a
thousand
hopes
that
Madeline
would
enjoy
herself
.
<EOS>
And
of
course
she
had
to
give
way
and
undertake
to
go
in
the
carriage
with
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
she
was
driven
either
to
do
this
or
to
explain
why
she
would
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
Now
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
explain
to
Charlotte
Stanhope
all
that
had
passed
at
Plumstead
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
to
her
a
sore
necessity
.
<EOS>
She
thought
of
a
thousand
little
schemes
for
avoiding
it
;
she
would
plead
illness
and
not
go
at
all
;
she
would
persuade
Mary
Bold
to
go
,
although
not
asked
,
and
then
make
a
necessity
of
having
a
carriage
of
her
own
to
take
her
sister
-
in
-
law
;
anything
,
in
fact
,
she
could
do
,
rather
than
be
seen
by
Mr.
Arabin
getting
out
of
the
same
carriage
with
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
However
,
when
the
momentous
morning
came
,
she
had
no
scheme
matured
,
and
then
Mr.
Slope
handed
her
into
Dr.
Stanhope
's
carriage
and
,
following
her
steps
,
sat
opposite
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
returned
on
the
eve
of
the
Ullathorne
party
,
and
was
received
at
home
with
radiant
smiles
by
the
partner
of
all
his
cares
.
<EOS>
On
his
arrival
he
crept
up
to
his
dressing
-
room
with
somewhat
of
a
palpitating
heart
;
he
had
overstayed
his
alloted
time
by
three
days
,
and
was
not
without
much
fear
of
penalties
.
<EOS>
Nothing
,
however
,
could
be
more
affectionately
cordial
than
the
greeting
he
received
;
the
girls
came
out
and
kissed
him
in
a
manner
that
was
quite
soothing
to
his
spirit
;
and
Mrs.
Proudie
,
"
albeit
,
unused
to
the
melting
mood
,
"
squeezed
him
in
her
arms
and
almost
in
words
called
him
her
dear
,
darling
,
good
,
<EOS>
pet
,
little
bishop
.
<EOS>
All
this
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
had
somewhat
changed
her
tactics
;
not
that
she
had
seen
any
cause
to
disapprove
of
her
former
line
of
conduct
,
but
she
had
now
brought
matters
to
such
a
point
that
she
calculated
that
she
might
safely
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
had
got
the
better
of
Mr.
Slope
,
and
she
now
thought
well
to
show
her
husband
that
when
allowed
to
get
the
better
of
everybody
,
when
obeyed
by
him
and
permitted
to
rule
over
others
,
she
would
take
care
that
he
should
have
his
reward
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
not
a
chance
against
her
;
not
only
could
she
stun
the
poor
bishop
by
her
midnight
anger
,
but
she
could
assuage
and
soothe
him
,
if
she
so
willed
,
by
daily
indulgences
.
<EOS>
She
could
furnish
his
room
for
him
,
turn
him
out
as
smart
a
bishop
as
any
on
the
bench
,
give
him
good
dinners
,
warm
fires
,
and
an
easy
life
 
<EOS>
all
this
she
would
do
if
he
would
but
be
quietly
obedient
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
not
,
 
!
To
speak
sooth
,
however
,
his
sufferings
on
that
dreadful
night
had
been
so
poignant
as
to
leave
him
little
spirit
for
further
rebellion
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
had
dressed
himself
,
she
returned
to
his
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
enjoyed
yourself
at
 
---
,
"
said
she
,
seating
herself
on
one
side
of
the
fire
while
he
remained
in
his
armchair
on
the
other
,
stroking
the
calves
of
his
legs
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
he
had
had
a
fire
in
his
room
since
the
summer
,
and
it
pleased
him
,
for
the
good
bishop
loved
to
be
warm
and
cosy
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
he
said
,
he
had
enjoyed
himself
very
much
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
polite
than
the
archbishop
,
and
Mrs.
Archbishop
had
been
equally
charming
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
was
delighted
to
hear
it
;
nothing
,
she
declared
,
pleased
her
so
much
as
to
think
  
Her
bairn
respectit
like
the
lave
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
put
it
precisely
in
these
words
,
but
what
she
said
came
to
the
same
thing
;
and
then
,
having
petted
and
fondled
her
little
man
sufficiently
,
she
proceeded
to
business
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
poor
dean
is
still
alive
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
hear
,
<EOS>
so
I
hear
,
"
said
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
to
the
deanery
directly
after
breakfast
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
going
to
this
party
at
Ullathorne
to
-
morrow
morning
,
my
dear
;
we
must
be
there
early
,
you
know
 
by
twelve
o'clock
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
 
ah
!
"
said
the
bishop
;
"
then
I
'll
certainly
call
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
much
said
about
it
at
 
---
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Proudie
.
  
<EOS>
"
About
what
?
"
said
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
Filling
up
the
dean
's
place
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
,
a
spark
of
the
wonted
fire
returned
to
her
eye
,
and
the
bishop
felt
himself
to
be
a
little
less
comfortable
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Filling
up
the
dean
's
place
;
that
is
,
if
the
dean
dies
?
<EOS>
Very
little
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
It
was
mentioned
,
just
mentioned
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
you
say
about
it
,
Bishop
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
said
that
I
thought
that
if
,
that
is
,
should
 
should
the
dean
die
,
that
is
,
I
said
I
thought
 
<EOS>
"
As
he
went
on
stammering
and
floundering
,
he
saw
that
his
wife
's
eye
was
fixed
sternly
on
him
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
encounter
such
evil
for
a
man
whom
he
loved
so
slightly
as
Mr.
Slope
?
<EOS>
Why
should
he
give
up
his
enjoyments
and
his
ease
and
such
dignity
as
might
be
allowed
to
him
to
fight
a
losing
battle
for
a
chaplain
?
<EOS>
The
chaplain
,
after
all
,
if
successful
,
would
be
as
great
a
tyrant
as
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Why
fight
at
all
?
<EOS>
Why
contend
?
<EOS>
Why
be
uneasy
?
<EOS>
From
that
moment
he
determined
to
fling
Mr.
Slope
to
the
winds
and
take
the
goods
the
gods
provided
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
told
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
,
speaking
very
slowly
,
"
that
Mr.
Slope
is
looking
to
be
the
new
dean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
certainly
,
I
believe
he
is
,
"
said
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
does
the
archbishop
say
about
that
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Proudie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
promised
Mr.
Slope
to
speak
to
the
archbishop
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
spoke
to
me
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
arrogant
of
him
,
I
must
say
 
<EOS>
but
that
is
nothing
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Arrogant
!
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
;
"
it
is
the
most
impudent
piece
of
pretension
I
ever
heard
of
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
Dean
of
Barchester
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
And
what
did
you
do
in
the
matter
,
Bishop
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
,
I
did
speak
to
the
archbishop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
tell
me
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
,
"
that
you
are
going
to
make
yourself
ridiculous
by
lending
your
name
to
such
a
preposterous
attempt
as
this
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
Dean
of
Barchester
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
she
tossed
her
head
and
put
her
arms
akimbo
with
an
air
of
confident
defiance
that
made
her
husband
quite
sure
that
Mr.
Slope
never
would
be
Dean
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
In
truth
,
Mrs.
Proudie
was
all
but
invincible
;
had
she
married
Petruchio
,
it
may
be
doubted
whether
that
arch
wife
-
tamer
would
have
been
able
to
keep
her
legs
out
of
those
garments
which
are
presumed
by
men
to
be
peculiarly
unfitted
for
feminine
use
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
preposterous
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
have
you
endeavoured
to
assist
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
 
my
dear
,
I
have
n't
assisted
him
 
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
have
you
done
it
at
all
?
<EOS>
Why
have
you
mixed
your
name
up
in
anything
so
ridiculous
?
<EOS>
What
was
it
<EOS>
you
did
say
to
the
archbishop
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
just
did
mention
it
;
I
just
did
say
that
 
that
in
the
event
of
the
poor
dean
's
death
,
Mr.
Slope
would
 
would
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
what
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
forget
how
I
put
it
 
would
take
it
if
he
could
get
it
;
something
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
say
much
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
n't
have
said
anything
at
all
.
<EOS>
And
what
did
the
archbishop
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
did
n't
say
anything
;
he
just
bowed
and
rubbed
his
hands
.
<EOS>
Somebody
else
came
up
at
the
moment
,
and
as
we
were
discussing
the
new
parochial
universal
school
committee
,
the
matter
of
the
new
dean
dropped
;
after
that
I
did
n't
think
it
wise
to
renew
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Renew
it
!
<EOS>
I
am
very
sorry
you
ever
mentioned
it
.
<EOS>
What
will
the
archbishop
think
of
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
sure
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
the
archbishop
thought
very
little
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
did
you
think
about
it
,
Bishop
?
<EOS>
How
could
you
think
of
making
such
a
creature
as
that
Dean
of
Barchester
?
<EOS>
Dean
of
Barchester
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
'll
be
looking
for
a
bishopric
some
of
these
days
 
a
man
that
hardly
knows
who
his
own
father
was
;
a
man
that
I
found
without
bread
to
his
mouth
or
a
coat
to
his
back
.
<EOS>
Dean
of
Barchester
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
'll
dean
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
considered
herself
to
be
in
politics
a
pure
Whig
;
all
her
family
belonged
to
the
Whig
party
.
<EOS>
Now
,
among
all
ranks
of
Englishmen
and
Englishwomen
(
Mrs.
Proudie
should
,
I
think
,
be
ranked
among
the
former
on
the
score
of
her
great
strength
of
mind
)
,
no
one
is
so
hostile
to
lowly
born
pretenders
to
high
station
as
the
pure
Whig
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
thought
it
necessary
to
exculpate
himself
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
,
"
said
he
,
"
it
appeared
to
me
that
you
and
Mr.
Slope
did
not
get
on
quite
so
well
as
you
used
to
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Get
on
!
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
,
moving
her
foot
uneasily
on
the
hearth
-
rug
and
compressing
her
lips
in
a
manner
that
betokened
much
danger
to
the
subject
of
their
discourse
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
began
to
find
that
he
was
objectionable
to
you
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
's
foot
worked
on
the
hearth
-
rug
with
great
rapidity
 
"
and
that
you
would
be
more
comfortable
if
he
was
out
of
the
palace
"
 
Mrs.
Proudie
smiled
,
as
a
hyena
may
probably
smile
before
he
begins
his
laugh
 
"
and
therefore
I
thought
that
if
he
got
this
place
,
and
so
ceased
to
be
my
chaplain
,
you
might
be
pleased
at
such
an
arrangement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
then
the
hyena
laughed
out
.
<EOS>
Pleased
at
such
an
arrangement
!
<EOS>
Pleased
at
having
her
enemy
converted
into
a
dean
with
twelve
hundred
a
year
!
<EOS>
Medea
,
when
she
describes
the
customs
of
her
native
country
(
I
am
quoting
from
Robson
's
edition
)
,
assures
her
astonished
auditor
that
in
her
land
captives
,
when
taken
,
are
eaten
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
pardon
them
?
"
says
Medea
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
do
indeed
,
"
says
the
mild
Grecian
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
eat
them
!
"
<EOS>
says
she
of
Colchis
,
with
terrific
energy
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
was
the
Medea
of
Barchester
;
she
had
no
idea
of
not
eating
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Pardon
him
!
<EOS>
Merely
get
rid
of
him
!
<EOS>
Make
a
dean
of
him
!
<EOS>
It
was
not
so
they
did
with
their
captives
in
her
country
,
among
people
of
her
sort
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
no
such
mercy
to
expect
;
she
would
pick
him
to
the
very
last
bone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
my
dear
,
of
course
he
'll
cease
to
be
your
chaplain
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
what
has
passed
,
that
must
be
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
for
a
moment
think
of
living
in
the
same
house
with
such
a
man
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
has
shown
himself
quite
unfit
for
such
a
situation
;
making
broils
and
quarrels
among
the
clergy
;
getting
you
,
my
dear
,
into
scrapes
;
and
taking
upon
himself
as
though
he
were
as
good
as
bishop
himself
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
'll
go
.
<EOS>
But
because
he
leaves
the
palace
,
that
is
no
reason
why
he
should
get
into
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
of
course
not
!
"
said
the
bishop
;
"
but
to
save
appearances
,
you
know
,
my
dear
 
"
  
"
I
do
n't
want
to
save
appearances
;
I
want
Mr.
Slope
to
appear
just
what
he
is
 
a
false
,
designing
,
mean
,
intriguing
man
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
eye
on
him
;
he
little
knows
what
I
see
.
<EOS>
He
is
misconducting
himself
in
the
most
disgraceful
way
with
that
lame
Italian
woman
.
<EOS>
That
family
is
a
disgrace
to
Barchester
,
and
Mr.
Slope
is
a
disgrace
to
Barchester
.
<EOS>
If
he
does
n't
look
well
to
it
,
he
'll
have
his
gown
stripped
off
his
back
instead
of
having
a
dean
's
hat
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
Dean
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
The
man
has
gone
mad
with
arrogance
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
said
nothing
further
to
excuse
either
himself
or
his
chaplain
,
and
having
shown
himself
passive
and
docile
,
was
again
taken
into
favour
.
<EOS>
They
soon
went
to
dinner
,
and
he
spent
the
pleasantest
evening
he
had
had
in
his
own
house
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
His
daughter
played
and
sang
to
him
as
he
sipped
his
coffee
and
read
his
newspaper
,
and
Mrs.
Proudie
asked
good
-
natured
little
questions
about
the
archbishop
;
and
then
he
went
happily
to
bed
and
slept
as
quietly
as
though
Mrs.
Proudie
had
been
Griselda
herself
.
<EOS>
While
shaving
himself
in
the
morning
and
preparing
for
the
festivities
of
Ullathorne
,
he
fully
resolved
to
run
no
more
tilts
against
a
warrior
so
fully
armed
at
all
points
as
was
Mrs.
Proudie
.
   
<EOS>
Oxford
 
<EOS>
The
Master
and
Tutor
of
Lazarus
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
as
we
have
said
,
had
but
a
sad
walk
of
it
under
the
trees
of
Plumstead
churchyard
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
appear
to
any
of
the
family
till
dinner
-
time
,
and
then
he
seemed
,
as
far
as
their
judgement
went
,
to
be
quite
himself
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
as
was
his
wo
nt
,
asked
himself
a
great
many
questions
and
given
himself
a
great
many
answers
;
and
the
upshot
of
this
was
that
he
had
sent
himself
down
for
an
ass
.
<EOS>
He
had
determined
that
he
was
much
too
old
and
much
too
rusty
to
commence
the
manoeuvres
of
love
-
making
;
that
he
had
let
the
time
slip
through
his
hands
which
should
have
been
used
for
such
purposes
;
and
that
now
he
must
lie
on
his
bed
as
he
had
made
it
.
<EOS>
Then
he
asked
himself
whether
in
truth
he
did
love
this
woman
;
and
he
answered
himself
,
not
without
a
long
struggle
,
but
at
last
honestly
,
that
he
certainly
did
love
her
.
<EOS>
He
then
asked
himself
whether
he
did
not
also
love
her
money
,
and
he
again
answered
himself
that
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
But
here
he
did
not
answer
honestly
.
<EOS>
It
was
and
ever
had
been
his
weakness
to
look
for
impure
motives
for
his
own
conduct
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
,
circumstanced
as
he
was
,
with
a
small
living
and
a
fellowship
,
accustomed
as
he
had
been
to
collegiate
luxuries
and
expensive
comforts
,
he
might
have
hesitated
to
marry
a
penniless
woman
<EOS>
had
he
felt
ever
so
strong
a
predilection
for
the
woman
herself
;
<EOS>
no
doubt
Eleanor
's
fortune
put
all
such
difficulties
out
of
the
question
;
but
it
was
equally
without
doubt
that
his
love
for
her
had
crept
upon
him
without
the
slightest
idea
on
his
part
that
he
could
ever
benefit
his
own
condition
by
sharing
her
wealth
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
stood
on
the
hearth
-
rug
,
counting
the
pattern
and
counting
also
the
future
chances
of
his
own
life
,
the
remembrances
of
Mrs.
Bold
's
comfortable
income
had
certainly
not
damped
his
first
assured
feeling
of
love
for
her
.
<EOS>
And
why
should
it
have
done
so
?
<EOS>
Need
it
have
done
so
with
the
purest
of
men
?
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
may
<EOS>
,
Mr.
Arabin
decided
against
himself
;
he
decided
that
it
had
done
so
in
his
case
,
and
that
he
was
not
the
purest
of
men
.
  
<EOS>
He
also
decided
,
which
was
more
to
his
purpose
,
that
Eleanor
did
not
care
a
straw
for
him
,
and
that
very
probably
she
did
care
a
straw
for
his
rival
.
<EOS>
Then
he
made
up
his
mind
not
to
think
of
her
any
more
,
and
went
on
thinking
of
her
till
he
was
almost
in
a
state
to
drown
himself
in
the
little
brook
which
ran
at
the
bottom
of
the
archdeacon
's
grounds
.
  
<EOS>
And
ever
and
again
his
mind
would
revert
to
the
Signora
Neroni
,
and
he
would
make
comparisons
between
her
and
Eleanor
Bold
,
not
always
in
favour
of
the
latter
.
<EOS>
The
signora
had
listened
to
him
,
and
flattered
him
,
and
believed
in
him
;
at
least
she
had
told
him
so
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
had
also
listened
to
him
,
but
had
never
flattered
him
;
had
not
always
believed
in
him
;
and
now
had
broken
from
him
in
violent
rage
.
<EOS>
The
signora
,
too
,
was
the
more
lovely
woman
of
the
two
,
and
had
also
the
additional
attraction
of
her
affliction
 
for
to
him
it
was
an
attraction
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
never
could
have
loved
the
Signora
Neroni
as
he
felt
that
he
now
loved
Eleanor
;
and
so
he
flung
stones
into
the
brook
,
instead
of
flinging
in
himself
,
and
sat
down
on
its
margin
as
sad
a
gentleman
as
you
shall
meet
in
a
summer
's
day
.
  
<EOS>
He
heard
the
dinner
-
bell
ring
from
the
churchyard
,
and
he
knew
that
it
was
time
to
recover
his
self
-
possession
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
he
was
disgracing
himself
in
his
own
eyes
,
that
he
had
been
idling
his
time
and
neglecting
the
high
duties
which
he
had
taken
upon
himself
to
perform
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
spent
this
afternoon
among
the
poor
at
St.
Ewold
's
,
instead
of
wandering
about
at
Plumstead
,
an
ancient
,
love
-
lorn
swain
,
dejected
and
sighing
,
full
of
imaginary
sorrows
and
Wertherian
grief
.
<EOS>
He
was
thoroughly
ashamed
of
himself
,
and
determined
to
lose
no
time
in
retrieving
his
character
,
so
damaged
in
his
own
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
when
he
appeared
at
dinner
he
was
as
animated
as
ever
and
was
the
author
of
most
of
the
conversation
which
graced
the
archdeacon
's
board
on
that
evening
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
was
ill
at
ease
and
sick
at
heart
,
and
did
not
care
to
appear
more
comfortable
than
he
really
was
;
what
little
he
did
say
was
said
to
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
the
archdeacon
and
Mr.
Arabin
had
leagued
together
against
Eleanor
's
comfort
,
and
his
wish
now
was
to
break
away
from
the
pair
and
undergo
in
his
Barchester
lodgings
whatever
Fate
had
in
store
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
hated
the
name
of
the
hospital
;
his
attempt
to
regain
his
lost
inheritance
there
had
brought
upon
him
so
much
suffering
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
he
was
concerned
,
Mr.
Quiverful
was
now
welcome
to
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
And
the
archdeacon
was
not
very
lively
.
<EOS>
The
poor
dean
's
illness
was
of
course
discussed
in
the
first
place
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
did
not
mention
Mr.
Slope
's
name
in
connexion
with
the
expected
event
of
Dr.
Trefoil
's
death
;
he
did
not
wish
to
say
anything
about
Mr.
Slope
just
at
present
,
nor
did
he
wish
to
make
known
his
sad
surmises
;
but
the
idea
that
his
enemy
might
possibly
become
Dean
of
Barchester
made
him
very
gloomy
.
<EOS>
Should
such
an
event
take
place
,
such
a
dire
catastrophe
come
about
,
there
would
be
an
end
to
his
life
as
far
as
his
life
was
connected
with
the
city
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
He
must
give
up
all
his
old
haunts
,
all
his
old
habits
,
and
live
quietly
as
a
retired
rector
at
Plumstead
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
a
severe
trial
for
him
to
have
Dr.
Proudie
in
the
palace
,
but
with
Mr.
Slope
also
in
the
deanery
<EOS>
he
felt
that
he
should
be
unable
to
draw
his
breath
in
Barchester
close
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
it
came
to
pass
that
in
spite
of
the
sorrow
at
his
heart
,
Mr.
Arabin
was
apparently
the
gayest
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
Both
Mr.
Harding
and
Mrs.
Grantly
were
in
a
slight
degree
angry
with
him
on
account
of
his
want
of
gloom
.
<EOS>
To
the
one
it
appeared
as
though
he
were
triumphing
at
Eleanor
's
banishment
,
and
to
the
other
that
he
was
not
affected
as
he
should
have
been
by
all
the
sad
circumstances
of
the
day
 
Eleanor
's
obstinacy
,
Mr.
Slope
's
success
,
and
the
poor
dean
's
apoplexy
.
<EOS>
And
so
they
were
all
at
cross
-
purposes
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
left
the
room
almost
together
with
the
ladies
,
and
then
the
archdeacon
opened
his
heart
to
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
He
still
harped
upon
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
What
did
that
fellow
mean
,
"
said
he
,
"
by
saying
in
his
letter
to
Mrs.
Bold
that
if
Mr.
Harding
would
call
on
the
bishop
,
it
would
be
all
right
?
<EOS>
Of
course
I
would
not
be
guided
by
anything
he
might
say
,
but
still
it
may
be
well
that
Mr.
Harding
should
see
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
foolish
to
let
the
thing
slip
through
our
fingers
because
Mrs.
Bold
is
determined
to
make
a
fool
of
herself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
hinted
that
he
was
not
quite
so
sure
that
Mrs.
Bold
would
make
a
fool
of
herself
.
<EOS>
He
said
that
he
was
not
convinced
that
she
did
regard
Mr.
Slope
so
warmly
as
she
was
supposed
to
do
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
questioned
and
cross
-
questioned
him
about
this
,
but
elicited
nothing
,
and
at
last
remained
firm
in
his
own
conviction
that
he
was
destined
,
_
malgré
lui
_
,
to
be
the
brother
-
in
-
law
of
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
strongly
advised
that
Mr.
Harding
should
take
no
step
regarding
the
hospital
in
connexion
with
,
or
in
consequence
of
,
Mr.
Slope
's
letter
.
<EOS>
"
If
the
bishop
really
means
to
confer
the
appointment
on
Mr.
Harding
,
"
argued
Mr.
Arabin
,
"
he
will
take
care
to
let
him
have
some
other
intimation
than
a
message
conveyed
through
a
letter
to
a
lady
.
<EOS>
Were
Mr.
Harding
to
present
himself
at
the
palace
,
he
might
merely
be
playing
Mr.
Slope
's
game
;
"
and
thus
it
was
settled
that
nothing
should
be
done
till
the
great
Dr.
Gwynne
's
arrival
,
or
at
any
rate
without
that
potentate
's
sanction
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
droll
to
observe
how
these
men
talked
of
Mr.
Harding
as
though
he
were
a
puppet
,
and
planned
their
intrigues
and
small
ecclesiastical
manoeuvres
in
reference
to
Mr.
Harding
's
future
position
without
dreaming
of
taking
him
into
their
confidence
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
comfortable
house
and
income
in
question
,
and
it
was
very
desirable
,
and
certainly
very
just
,
that
Mr.
Harding
should
have
them
;
but
that
at
present
was
not
the
main
point
;
it
was
expedient
to
beat
the
bishop
and
,
if
possible
,
to
smash
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
set
up
,
or
was
supposed
to
have
set
up
,
a
rival
candidate
.
<EOS>
Of
all
things
the
most
desirable
would
have
been
to
have
had
Mr.
Quiverful
's
appointment
published
to
the
public
and
then
annulled
by
the
clamour
of
an
indignant
world
,
loud
in
the
defence
of
Mr.
Harding
's
rights
.
<EOS>
But
of
such
an
event
the
chance
was
small
;
a
slight
fraction
only
of
the
world
would
be
indignant
,
and
that
fraction
would
be
one
not
accustomed
to
loud
speaking
.
<EOS>
And
then
the
preferment
had
,
in
a
sort
of
way
,
been
offered
to
Mr.
Harding
and
had
,
in
a
sort
of
way
,
been
refused
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
's
wicked
,
cunning
hand
had
been
peculiarly
conspicuous
in
the
way
in
which
this
had
been
brought
to
pass
,
and
it
was
the
success
of
Mr.
Slope
's
cunning
which
was
so
painfully
grating
to
the
feelings
of
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
That
which
of
all
things
he
most
dreaded
was
that
he
should
be
outgeneralled
by
Mr.
Slope
;
and
just
at
present
it
appeared
probable
that
Mr.
Slope
would
turn
his
flank
,
steal
a
march
on
him
,
cut
off
his
provisions
,
carry
his
strong
town
by
a
_
coup
de
main
_
,
and
at
last
beat
him
thoroughly
in
a
regular
pitched
battle
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
felt
that
his
flank
had
been
turned
when
desired
to
wait
on
Mr.
Slope
instead
of
the
bishop
,
that
a
march
had
been
stolen
when
Mr.
Harding
was
induced
to
refuse
the
bishop
's
offer
,
that
his
provisions
would
be
cut
off
when
Mr.
Quiverful
got
the
hospital
,
that
Eleanor
was
the
strong
town
doomed
to
be
taken
,
and
that
Mr.
Slope
,
as
Dean
of
Barchester
,
would
be
regarded
by
all
the
world
as
conqueror
in
the
final
conflict
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
was
the
_
Deus
ex
machina
_
who
was
to
come
down
upon
the
Barchester
stage
and
bring
about
deliverance
from
these
terrible
evils
.
<EOS>
But
how
can
melodramatic
_
dénouements
_
be
properly
brought
about
,
how
can
vice
and
Mr.
Slope
be
punished
,
and
virtue
and
the
archdeacon
be
rewarded
,
while
the
avenging
god
is
laid
up
with
the
gout
?
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
evil
may
be
triumphant
,
and
poor
innocence
,
transfixed
to
the
earth
by
an
arrow
from
Dr.
Proudie
's
quiver
,
may
lie
dead
upon
the
ground
,
not
to
be
resuscitated
even
by
Dr.
Gwynne
.
  
<EOS>
Two
or
three
days
after
Eleanor
's
departure
,
Mr.
Arabin
went
to
Oxford
and
soon
found
himself
closeted
with
the
august
head
of
his
college
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
clear
that
Dr.
Gwynne
was
not
very
sanguine
as
to
the
effects
of
his
journey
to
Barchester
,
and
not
over
-
anxious
to
interfere
with
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
He
had
had
the
gout
,
but
was
very
nearly
convalescent
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
at
once
saw
that
had
the
mission
been
one
of
which
the
master
thoroughly
approved
,
he
would
before
this
have
been
at
Plumstead
.
  
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
Dr.
Gwynne
was
resolved
on
visiting
his
friend
,
and
willingly
promised
to
return
to
Barchester
with
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
that
there
was
any
probability
that
Mr.
Slope
would
be
made
Dean
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
Rumour
,
he
said
,
had
reached
even
his
ears
,
not
at
all
favourable
to
that
gentleman
's
character
,
and
he
expressed
himself
strongly
of
opinion
that
any
such
appointment
was
quite
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
At
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
,
the
master
's
right
-
hand
man
,
Tom
Staple
,
was
called
in
to
assist
at
the
conference
.
<EOS>
Tom
Staple
was
the
Tutor
of
Lazarus
and
,
moreover
,
a
great
man
at
Oxford
.
<EOS>
Though
universally
known
by
a
species
of
nomenclature
so
very
undignified
,
Tom
Staple
was
one
who
maintained
a
high
dignity
in
the
university
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
as
it
were
,
the
leader
of
the
Oxford
tutors
,
a
body
of
men
who
consider
themselves
collectively
as
being
by
very
little
,
if
at
all
,
second
in
importance
to
the
heads
themselves
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
always
the
case
that
the
master
,
or
warden
,
or
provost
,
or
principal
can
hit
it
off
exactly
with
his
tutor
.
<EOS>
A
tutor
is
by
no
means
indisposed
to
have
a
will
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
But
at
Lazarus
they
were
great
friends
and
firm
allies
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
writing
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
Staple
was
a
hale
,
strong
man
of
about
forty
-
five
,
short
in
stature
,
swarthy
in
face
,
<EOS>
with
strong
,
sturdy
black
hair
and
crisp
black
beard
of
which
very
little
was
allowed
to
show
itself
in
shape
of
whiskers
.
<EOS>
He
always
wore
a
white
neckcloth
,
clean
indeed
,
but
not
tied
with
that
scrupulous
care
which
now
distinguishes
some
of
our
younger
clergy
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
of
course
,
always
clothed
in
a
seemly
suit
of
solemn
black
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Staple
was
a
decent
cleanly
liver
,
not
over
-
addicted
to
any
sensuality
;
but
nevertheless
a
somewhat
warmish
hue
was
beginning
to
adorn
his
nose
,
the
peculiar
effect
,
as
his
friends
averred
,
of
a
certain
pipe
of
port
introduced
into
the
cellars
of
Lazarus
the
very
same
year
in
which
the
tutor
entered
it
as
a
freshman
.
<EOS>
There
was
also
,
perhaps
,
a
little
redolence
of
port
wine
,
as
it
were
the
slightest
possible
twang
,
in
Mr.
Staple
's
voice
.
  
<EOS>
In
these
latter
days
Tom
Staple
was
not
a
happy
man
;
university
reform
had
long
been
his
bugbear
,
and
now
was
his
bane
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
with
him
,
as
with
most
others
,
an
affair
of
politics
,
respecting
which
,
when
the
need
existed
,
he
could
,
for
parties
<EOS>
"
sake
or
on
behalf
of
principle
,
maintain
a
certain
amount
of
necessary
zeal
;
it
was
not
with
him
a
subject
for
dilettante
warfare
and
courteous
,
commonplace
opposition
.
<EOS>
To
him
it
was
life
and
death
.
<EOS>
The
_
status
quo
_
of
the
university
was
his
only
idea
of
life
,
and
any
reformation
was
as
bad
to
him
as
death
.
<EOS>
He
would
willingly
have
been
a
martyr
in
the
cause
,
had
the
cause
admitted
of
martyrdom
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
present
day
,
unfortunately
,
public
affairs
will
allow
of
no
martyrs
,
and
therefore
it
is
that
there
is
such
a
deficiency
of
zeal
.
<EOS>
Could
gentlemen
of
£
10,000
a
year
have
died
on
their
own
door
-
steps
in
defence
of
protection
,
no
doubt
some
half
-
dozen
glorious
old
baronets
would
have
so
fallen
,
and
the
school
of
protection
would
at
this
day
have
been
crowded
with
scholars
.
<EOS>
Who
can
fight
strenuously
in
any
combat
in
which
there
is
no
danger
?
<EOS>
Tom
Staple
would
have
willingly
been
impaled
before
a
Committee
of
the
House
,
could
he
by
such
self
-
sacrifice
have
infused
his
own
spirit
into
the
component
members
of
the
hebdomadal
board
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
Staple
was
one
of
those
who
in
his
heart
approved
of
the
credit
system
which
had
of
old
been
in
vogue
between
the
students
and
tradesmen
of
the
university
.
<EOS>
He
knew
and
acknowledged
to
himself
that
it
was
useless
in
these
degenerate
days
publicly
to
contend
with
"
The
Jupiter
"
on
such
a
subject
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Jupiter
"
had
undertaken
to
rule
the
university
,
and
Tom
Staple
was
well
aware
that
"
The
Jupiter
"
was
too
powerful
for
him
.
<EOS>
But
in
secret
,
and
among
his
safe
companions
,
he
would
argue
that
the
system
of
credit
was
an
ordeal
good
for
young
men
to
undergo
.
  
<EOS>
The
bad
men
,
said
he
,
the
weak
and
worthless
,
blunder
into
danger
and
burn
their
feet
;
but
the
good
men
,
they
who
have
any
character
,
they
who
have
that
within
them
which
can
reflect
credit
on
their
alma
mater
,
they
come
through
scatheless
.
<EOS>
What
merit
will
there
be
to
a
young
man
to
get
through
safely
,
if
he
be
guarded
and
protected
and
restrained
like
a
schoolboy
?
<EOS>
By
so
doing
,
the
period
of
the
ordeal
is
only
postponed
,
and
the
manhood
of
the
man
will
be
deferred
from
the
age
of
twenty
to
that
of
twenty
-
four
.
<EOS>
If
you
bind
him
with
leading
-
strings
at
college
,
he
will
break
loose
while
eating
for
the
bar
in
London
;
bind
him
there
,
and
he
will
break
loose
afterwards
,
when
he
is
a
married
man
.
<EOS>
The
wild
oats
must
be
sown
somewhere
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twas
thus
that
Tom
Staple
would
argue
of
young
men
,
not
,
indeed
,
with
much
consistency
,
but
still
with
some
practical
knowledge
of
the
subject
gathered
from
long
experience
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
Tom
Staple
proffered
such
wisdom
as
he
had
for
the
assistance
of
Dr.
Gwynne
and
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
out
of
the
question
,
"
said
he
,
arguing
that
Mr.
Slope
could
not
possibly
be
made
the
new
Dean
of
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
think
,
"
said
the
master
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
no
standing
,
and
,
if
all
I
hear
be
true
,
very
little
character
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
As
to
character
,
"
said
Tom
Staple
,
"
I
do
n't
think
much
of
that
.
<EOS>
They
rather
like
loose
parsons
for
deans
;
a
little
fast
living
,
or
a
dash
of
infidelity
,
is
no
bad
recommendation
to
a
cathedral
close
.
<EOS>
But
they
could
n't
make
Mr.
Slope
;
the
last
two
deans
have
been
Cambridge
men
;
you
'll
not
show
me
an
instance
of
their
making
three
men
running
from
the
same
university
.
<EOS>
We
do
n't
get
our
share
and
never
shall
,
I
suppose
,
but
we
must
at
least
have
one
out
of
three
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Those
sort
of
rules
are
all
gone
by
now
,
"
said
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Everything
has
gone
by
,
I
believe
,
"
said
Tom
Staple
.
<EOS>
"
The
cigar
has
been
smoked
out
,
and
we
are
the
ashes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Speak
for
yourself
,
Staple
,
"
said
the
master
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
speak
for
all
,
"
said
the
tutor
stoutly
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
coming
to
that
,
that
there
will
be
no
life
left
anywhere
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
No
one
is
any
longer
fit
to
rule
himself
,
or
those
belonging
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
Government
is
to
find
us
all
in
everything
,
and
the
press
is
to
find
the
Government
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
Mr.
Slope
wo
n't
be
Dean
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
who
will
be
warden
of
the
hospital
?
"
said
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
that
Mr.
Quiverful
is
already
appointed
,
"
said
Tom
Staple
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
"
said
the
master
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
think
,
moreover
,
that
Dr.
Proudie
will
not
be
so
short
-
sighted
as
to
run
against
such
a
rock
<EOS>
:
Mr.
Slope
should
himself
have
sense
enough
to
prevent
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
perhaps
Mr.
Slope
may
have
no
objection
to
see
his
patron
on
a
rock
,
"
said
the
suspicious
tutor
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
could
he
get
by
that
?
"
asked
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
impossible
to
see
the
doubles
of
such
a
man
,
"
said
Mr.
Staple
.
<EOS>
"
It
seems
quite
clear
that
Bishop
Proudie
is
altogether
in
his
hands
,
and
it
is
equally
clear
that
he
has
been
moving
heaven
and
earth
to
get
this
Mr.
Quiverful
into
the
hospital
,
although
he
must
know
that
such
an
appointment
would
be
most
damaging
to
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
understand
such
a
man
,
and
dreadful
to
think
,
"
added
Tom
Staple
,
sighing
deeply
,
"
that
the
welfare
and
fortunes
of
good
men
may
depend
on
his
intrigues
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
or
Mr.
Staple
were
not
in
the
least
aware
,
nor
even
was
Mr.
Arabin
,
that
this
Mr.
Slope
,
of
whom
they
were
talking
,
had
been
using
his
utmost
efforts
to
put
their
own
candidate
into
the
hospital
,
and
that
in
lieu
of
being
permanent
in
the
palace
,
his
own
expulsion
therefrom
had
been
already
decided
on
by
the
high
powers
of
the
diocese
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
"
said
the
tutor
,
"
if
this
Quiverful
is
thrust
into
the
hospital
and
Dr.
Trefoil
does
die
,
I
should
not
wonder
if
the
Government
were
to
make
Mr.
Harding
Dean
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
They
would
feel
bound
to
do
something
for
him
after
all
that
was
said
when
he
resigned
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
at
the
moment
made
no
reply
to
this
suggestion
,
but
it
did
not
the
less
impress
itself
on
his
mind
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Harding
could
not
be
warden
of
the
hospital
,
why
should
he
not
be
Dean
of
Barchester
?
  
<EOS>
And
so
the
conference
ended
without
any
very
fixed
resolution
,
and
Dr.
Gwynne
and
Mr.
Arabin
prepared
for
their
journey
to
Plumstead
on
the
morrow
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
's
Fête
Champêtre
 
<EOS>
The
day
of
the
Ullathorne
party
arrived
,
and
all
the
world
were
there
 
or
at
least
so
much
of
the
world
as
had
been
included
in
Miss
Thorne
's
invitation
.
<EOS>
As
we
have
said
,
the
bishop
returned
home
on
the
previous
evening
,
and
on
the
same
evening
and
by
the
same
train
came
Dr.
Gwynne
and
Mr.
Arabin
from
Oxford
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
with
his
brougham
was
in
waiting
for
the
Master
of
Lazarus
,
so
that
there
was
a
goodly
show
of
church
dignitaries
on
the
platform
of
the
railway
.
  
<EOS>
The
Stanhope
party
was
finally
arranged
in
the
odious
manner
already
described
,
and
Eleanor
got
into
the
doctor
's
carriage
full
of
apprehension
and
presentiment
of
further
misfortune
,
whereas
Mr.
Slope
entered
the
vehicle
elate
with
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
received
that
morning
a
very
civil
note
from
Sir
Nicholas
Fitzwhiggin
,
not
promising
much
,
indeed
,
but
then
Mr.
Slope
knew
,
or
fancied
that
he
knew
,
that
it
was
not
etiquette
for
government
officers
to
make
promises
.
<EOS>
Though
Sir
Nicholas
promised
nothing
he
implied
a
good
deal
,
declared
his
conviction
that
Mr.
Slope
would
make
an
excellent
dean
,
and
wished
him
every
kind
of
success
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
he
added
that
,
not
being
in
the
cabinet
,
he
was
never
consulted
on
such
matters
,
and
that
even
if
he
spoke
on
the
subject
,
his
voice
would
go
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
all
this
Mr.
Slope
took
for
the
prudent
reserve
of
official
life
.
<EOS>
To
complete
his
anticipated
triumphs
,
another
letter
was
brought
to
him
just
as
he
was
about
to
start
to
Ullathorne
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
also
enjoyed
the
idea
of
handing
Mrs.
Bold
out
of
Dr.
Stanhope
's
carriage
before
the
multitude
at
Ullathorne
gate
as
much
as
Eleanor
dreaded
the
same
ceremony
.
<EOS>
He
had
fully
made
up
his
mind
to
throw
himself
and
his
fortune
at
the
widow
's
feet
,
and
had
almost
determined
to
select
the
present
propitious
morning
for
doing
so
.
<EOS>
The
signora
had
of
late
been
less
than
civil
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
indeed
admitted
his
visits
and
listened
,
at
any
rate
without
anger
,
to
his
love
,
but
she
had
tortured
him
and
reviled
him
,
jeered
at
him
and
ridiculed
him
,
while
she
allowed
him
to
call
her
the
most
beautiful
of
living
women
,
to
kiss
her
hand
,
and
to
proclaim
himself
with
reiterated
oaths
her
adorer
,
her
slave
and
worshipper
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
was
in
great
perturbation
,
yet
in
great
glory
,
on
the
morning
of
the
gala
day
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
also
,
though
the
party
was
none
of
his
giving
,
had
much
heavy
work
on
his
hands
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
the
most
overtasked
,
the
most
anxious
,
and
the
most
effective
of
all
the
Ullathorne
household
was
Mr.
Plomacy
,
the
steward
.
<EOS>
This
last
personage
had
,
in
the
time
of
Mr.
Thorne
's
father
,
when
the
Directory
held
dominion
in
France
,
gone
over
to
Paris
with
letters
in
his
boot
-
heel
for
some
of
the
royal
party
,
and
such
had
been
his
good
luck
that
he
had
returned
safe
.
<EOS>
He
had
then
been
very
young
and
was
now
very
old
,
but
the
exploit
gave
him
a
character
for
political
enterprise
and
secret
discretion
which
still
availed
him
as
thoroughly
as
it
had
done
in
its
freshest
gloss
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Plomacy
had
been
steward
of
Ullathorne
for
more
than
fifty
years
,
and
a
very
easy
life
he
had
had
of
it
.
<EOS>
Who
could
require
much
absolute
work
from
a
man
who
had
carried
safely
at
his
heel
that
which
,
if
discovered
,
would
have
cost
him
his
head
?
<EOS>
Consequently
Mr.
Plomacy
had
never
worked
hard
,
and
of
latter
years
had
never
worked
at
all
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
taste
for
timber
,
and
therefore
he
marked
the
trees
that
were
to
be
cut
down
;
he
had
a
taste
for
gardening
,
and
would
therefore
allow
no
shrub
to
be
planted
or
bed
to
be
made
without
his
express
sanction
.
<EOS>
In
these
matters
he
was
sometimes
driven
to
run
counter
to
his
mistress
,
but
he
rarely
allowed
his
mistress
to
carry
the
point
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
on
occasions
such
as
the
present
Mr.
Plomacy
came
out
strong
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
honour
of
the
family
at
heart
;
he
thoroughly
appreciated
the
duties
of
hospitality
;
and
therefore
,
when
gala
doings
were
going
on
,
he
always
took
the
management
into
his
own
hands
and
reigned
supreme
over
master
and
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
To
give
Mr.
Plomacy
his
due
,
old
as
he
was
,
he
thoroughly
understood
such
work
as
he
had
in
hand
,
and
did
it
well
.
  
<EOS>
The
order
of
the
day
was
to
be
as
follows
.
<EOS>
The
quality
,
as
the
upper
classes
in
rural
districts
are
designated
by
the
lower
with
so
much
true
discrimination
,
were
to
eat
a
breakfast
,
and
the
non
-
quality
were
to
eat
a
dinner
.
<EOS>
Two
marquees
had
been
erected
for
these
two
banquets
:
that
for
the
quality
on
the
esoteric
or
garden
side
of
a
certain
deep
ha
-
ha
;
and
that
for
the
non
-
quality
on
the
exoteric
or
paddock
side
of
the
same
.
<EOS>
Both
were
of
huge
dimensions
 
that
on
the
outer
side
was
,
one
may
say
,
on
an
egregious
scale
 
but
Mr.
Plomacy
declared
that
neither
would
be
sufficient
.
<EOS>
To
remedy
this
,
an
auxiliary
banquet
was
prepared
in
the
dining
-
room
,
and
a
subsidiary
board
was
to
be
spread
_
sub
dio
_
for
the
accommodation
of
the
lower
class
of
yokels
on
the
Ullathorne
property
.
  
<EOS>
No
one
who
has
not
had
a
hand
in
the
preparation
of
such
an
affair
can
understand
the
manifold
difficulties
which
Miss
Thorne
encountered
in
her
project
.
<EOS>
Had
she
not
been
made
throughout
of
the
very
finest
whalebone
,
riveted
with
the
best
Yorkshire
steel
,
she
must
have
sunk
under
them
.
<EOS>
Had
not
Mr.
Plomacy
felt
how
much
was
justly
expected
from
a
man
who
at
one
time
carried
the
destinies
of
Europe
in
his
boot
,
he
would
have
given
way
,
and
his
mistress
,
so
deserted
,
must
have
perished
among
her
poles
and
canvas
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
there
was
a
dreadful
line
to
be
drawn
.
<EOS>
Who
were
to
dispose
themselves
within
the
ha
-
ha
,
and
who
without
?
<EOS>
To
this
the
unthinking
will
give
an
off
-
hand
answer
,
as
they
will
to
every
ponderous
question
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
bishop
and
such
-
like
within
the
ha
-
ha
,
and
Farmer
Greenacre
and
such
-
like
without
.
<EOS>
True
,
my
unthinking
friend
,
but
who
shall
define
these
such
-
likes
?
<EOS>
It
is
in
such
definitions
that
the
whole
difficulty
of
society
consists
.
<EOS>
To
seat
the
bishop
on
an
arm
-
chair
on
the
lawn
and
place
Farmer
Greenacre
at
the
end
of
a
long
table
in
the
paddock
is
easy
enough
,
but
where
will
you
put
Mrs.
Lookaloft
,
whose
husband
,
though
a
tenant
on
the
estate
,
hunts
in
a
red
coat
,
whose
daughters
go
to
a
fashionable
seminary
in
Barchester
,
who
calls
her
farm
-
house
Rosebank
,
and
who
has
a
pianoforte
in
her
drawing
-
room
?
<EOS>
The
Misses
Lookaloft
,
as
they
call
themselves
,
wo
n't
sit
contented
among
the
bumpkins
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lookaloft
wo
n't
squeeze
her
fine
clothes
on
a
bench
and
talk
familiarly
about
cream
and
ducklings
to
good
Mrs.
Greenacre
.
<EOS>
And
yet
Mrs.
Lookaloft
is
no
fit
companion
and
never
has
been
the
associate
of
the
Thornes
and
the
Grantlys
.
<EOS>
And
if
Mrs.
Lookaloft
be
admitted
within
the
sanctum
of
fashionable
life
,
if
she
be
allowed
with
her
three
daughters
to
leap
the
ha
-
ha
,
why
not
the
wives
and
daughters
of
other
families
also
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenacre
is
at
present
well
contented
with
the
paddock
,
but
she
might
cease
to
be
so
if
she
saw
Mrs.
Lookaloft
on
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
And
thus
poor
Miss
Thorne
had
a
hard
time
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
And
how
was
she
to
divide
her
guests
between
the
marquee
and
the
parlour
?
<EOS>
She
had
a
countess
coming
,
an
Honourable
John
and
an
Honourable
George
,
and
a
whole
bevy
of
Ladies
Amelia
,
Rosina
,
Margaretta
,
&
c
;
she
had
a
leash
of
baronets
with
their
baronettes
;
and
,
as
we
all
know
,
she
had
a
bishop
.
<EOS>
If
she
put
them
on
the
lawn
,
no
one
would
go
into
the
parlour
;
if
she
put
them
into
the
parlour
,
no
one
would
go
into
the
tent
.
<EOS>
She
thought
of
keeping
the
old
people
in
the
house
and
leaving
the
lawn
to
the
lovers
.
<EOS>
She
might
as
well
have
seated
herself
at
once
in
a
hornet
's
nest
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Plomacy
knew
better
than
this
.
"
<EOS>
Bless
your
soul
,
ma'am
,
"
said
he
,
"
there
wo
n't
be
no
old
ladies
 
not
one
,
barring
yourself
and
old
Mrs.
Clantantram
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Personally
Miss
Thorne
accepted
this
distinction
in
her
favour
as
a
compliment
to
her
good
sense
,
but
nevertheless
she
had
no
desire
to
be
closeted
on
the
coming
occasion
with
Mrs.
Clantantram
.
<EOS>
She
gave
up
all
idea
of
any
arbitrary
division
of
her
guests
and
determined
if
possible
to
put
the
bishop
on
the
lawn
and
the
countess
in
the
house
,
to
sprinkle
the
baronets
,
and
thus
divide
the
attractions
.
<EOS>
What
to
do
with
the
Lookalofts
even
Mr.
Plomacy
could
not
decide
.
<EOS>
They
must
take
their
chance
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
specially
told
in
the
invitation
that
all
the
tenants
had
been
invited
,
and
they
might
probably
have
the
good
sense
to
stay
away
if
they
objected
to
mix
with
the
rest
of
the
tenantry
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Plomacy
declared
his
apprehension
that
the
Honourable
Johns
and
Honourable
Georges
would
come
in
a
sort
of
amphibious
costume
,
half
-
morning
,
half
-
evening
,
satin
neck
-
handkerchiefs
,
frock
-
coats
,
primrose
gloves
,
and
polished
boots
;
and
that
,
being
so
dressed
,
they
would
decline
riding
at
the
quintain
,
or
taking
part
in
any
of
the
athletic
games
which
Miss
Thorne
had
prepared
with
so
much
fond
care
.
<EOS>
If
the
Lord
Johns
and
Lord
Georges
did
n't
ride
at
the
quintain
,
Miss
Thorne
might
be
sure
that
nobody
else
would
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
said
she
in
dolorous
voice
,
all
but
overcome
by
her
cares
,
"
it
was
specially
signified
that
there
were
to
be
sports
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
so
there
will
be
,
of
course
,
"
said
Mr.
Plomacy
.
<EOS>
"
They
'll
all
be
sporting
with
the
young
ladies
in
the
laurel
walks
.
<EOS>
Them
's
the
sports
they
care
most
about
now
-
a
-
days
.
<EOS>
If
you
gets
the
young
men
at
the
quintain
,
you
'll
have
all
the
young
women
in
the
pouts
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ca
n't
they
look
on
as
their
great
grandmothers
did
before
them
?
"
said
Miss
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
me
that
the
ladies
ai
n't
contented
with
looking
now
-
a
-
days
.
<EOS>
Whatever
the
men
do
they
'll
do
.
<EOS>
If
you
'll
have
side
-
saddles
on
the
nags
;
and
let
them
go
at
the
quintain
too
,
it
'll
answer
capital
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
made
no
reply
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
she
had
no
good
ground
on
which
to
defend
her
sex
of
the
present
generation
from
the
sarcasm
of
Mr.
Plomacy
.
<EOS>
She
had
once
declared
,
in
one
of
her
warmer
moments
,
"
that
now
-
a
-
days
the
gentlemen
were
all
women
,
and
the
ladies
all
men
.
<EOS>
"
She
could
not
alter
the
debased
character
of
the
age
.
<EOS>
But
,
such
being
the
case
,
why
should
she
take
on
herself
to
cater
for
the
amusement
of
people
of
such
degraded
tastes
?
<EOS>
This
question
she
asked
herself
more
than
once
,
and
she
could
only
answer
herself
with
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
There
was
her
own
brother
Wilfred
,
on
whose
shoulders
rested
all
the
ancient
honours
of
Ullathorne
house
;
it
was
very
doubtful
whether
even
he
would
consent
to
"
go
at
the
quintain
,
"
as
Mr.
Plomacy
not
injudiciously
expressed
it
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
the
morning
arrived
.
<EOS>
The
Ullathorne
household
was
early
on
the
move
.
<EOS>
Cooks
were
cooking
in
the
kitchen
long
before
daylight
,
and
men
were
dragging
out
tables
and
hammering
red
baize
on
to
benches
at
the
earliest
dawn
.
<EOS>
With
what
dread
eagerness
did
Miss
Thorne
look
out
at
the
weather
as
soon
as
the
parting
veil
of
night
permitted
her
to
look
at
all
!
<EOS>
In
this
respect
,
at
any
rate
,
there
was
nothing
to
grieve
her
.
<EOS>
The
glass
had
been
rising
for
the
last
three
days
,
and
the
morning
broke
with
that
dull
,
chill
,
steady
,
grey
haze
which
in
autumn
generally
presages
a
clear
and
dry
day
.
<EOS>
By
seven
she
was
dressed
and
down
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
knew
nothing
of
the
modern
luxury
of
_
déshabilles
_
.
<EOS>
She
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
appearing
before
her
brother
without
her
stockings
as
without
her
stays
 
and
Miss
Thorne
's
stays
were
no
trifle
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
there
was
nothing
for
her
to
do
when
down
.
<EOS>
She
fidgeted
out
to
the
lawn
and
then
back
into
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
She
put
on
her
high
-
heeled
clogs
and
fidgeted
out
into
the
paddock
.
<EOS>
Then
she
went
into
the
small
home
park
where
the
quintain
was
erected
.
<EOS>
The
pole
and
cross
-
bar
and
the
swivel
and
the
target
and
the
bag
of
flour
were
all
complete
.
<EOS>
She
got
up
on
a
carpenter
's
bench
and
touched
the
target
with
her
hand
;
it
went
round
with
beautiful
ease
;
the
swivel
had
been
oiled
to
perfection
.
<EOS>
She
almost
wished
to
take
old
Plomacy
at
his
word
,
to
get
on
a
side
-
saddle
and
have
a
tilt
at
it
herself
.
<EOS>
What
must
a
young
man
be
,
thought
she
,
who
could
prefer
maundering
among
laurel
trees
with
a
wishy
-
washy
school
-
girl
to
such
fun
as
this
?
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
she
aloud
to
herself
,
"
one
man
can
take
a
horse
to
water
,
but
a
thousand
ca
n't
make
him
drink
.
<EOS>
There
it
is
.
<EOS>
If
they
have
n't
the
spirit
to
enjoy
it
,
the
fault
sha
n't
be
mine
;
"
and
so
she
returned
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
At
a
little
after
eight
her
brother
came
down
,
and
they
had
a
sort
of
scrap
breakfast
in
his
study
.
<EOS>
The
tea
was
made
without
the
customary
urn
,
and
they
dispensed
with
the
usual
rolls
and
toast
.
<EOS>
Eggs
also
were
missing
,
for
every
egg
in
the
parish
had
been
whipped
into
custards
,
baked
into
pies
,
or
boiled
into
lobster
salad
.
<EOS>
The
allowance
of
fresh
butter
was
short
,
and
Mr.
Thorne
was
obliged
to
eat
the
leg
of
a
fowl
without
having
it
devilled
in
the
manner
he
loved
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
looking
at
the
quintain
,
Wilfred
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
it
appears
to
be
quite
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
 
ah
,
yes
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
It
seemed
to
be
so
yesterday
when
I
saw
it
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
was
beginning
to
be
rather
bored
by
his
sister
's
love
of
sports
,
and
had
especially
no
affection
for
this
quintain
post
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
'd
just
try
it
after
breakfast
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
You
could
have
the
saddle
put
on
Mark
Antony
,
and
the
pole
is
there
all
handy
.
<EOS>
You
can
take
the
flour
bag
off
,
you
know
,
if
you
think
Mark
Antony
wo
n't
be
quick
enough
,
"
added
Miss
Thorne
,
seeing
that
her
brother
's
countenance
was
not
indicative
of
complete
accordance
with
her
little
proposition
.
  
<EOS>
Now
Mark
Antony
was
a
valuable
old
hunter
,
excellently
suited
to
Mr.
Thorne
's
usual
requirements
,
steady
indeed
at
his
fences
,
but
extremely
sure
,
very
good
in
deep
ground
,
and
safe
on
the
roads
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
never
yet
been
ridden
at
a
quintain
,
and
Mr.
Thorne
was
not
inclined
to
put
him
to
the
trial
,
either
with
or
without
the
bag
of
flour
.
<EOS>
He
hummed
and
hawed
and
finally
declared
that
he
was
afraid
Mark
Antony
would
shy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
try
the
cob
,
"
said
the
indefatigable
Miss
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
in
physic
,
"
said
Wilfred
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
Beelzebub
colt
,
"
said
his
sister
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
's
in
the
stable
because
I
saw
Peter
exercising
him
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Monica
,
he
's
so
wild
that
it
's
as
much
as
I
can
do
to
manage
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
He
'd
destroy
himself
and
me
,
too
,
if
I
attempted
to
ride
him
at
such
a
rattletrap
as
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
rattletrap
!
<EOS>
The
quintain
that
she
had
put
up
with
so
much
anxious
care
;
the
game
that
she
had
prepared
for
the
amusement
of
the
stalwart
yeomen
of
the
country
;
the
sport
that
had
been
honoured
by
the
affection
of
so
many
of
their
ancestors
!
<EOS>
It
cut
her
to
the
heart
to
hear
it
so
denominated
by
her
own
brother
.
<EOS>
There
were
but
the
two
of
them
left
together
in
the
world
,
and
it
had
ever
been
one
of
the
rules
by
which
Miss
Thorne
had
regulated
her
conduct
through
life
to
say
nothing
that
could
provoke
her
brother
.
<EOS>
She
had
often
had
to
suffer
from
his
indifference
to
time
-
honoured
British
customs
,
but
she
had
always
suffered
in
silence
.
<EOS>
It
was
part
of
her
creed
that
the
head
of
the
family
should
never
be
upbraided
in
his
own
house
,
and
Miss
Thorne
had
lived
up
to
her
creed
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
she
was
greatly
tried
.
<EOS>
The
colour
mounted
to
her
ancient
cheek
,
and
the
fire
blazed
in
her
still
bright
eyes
;
but
yet
she
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
resolved
that
,
at
any
rate
,
to
him
nothing
more
should
be
said
about
the
quintain
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
She
sipped
her
tea
in
silent
sorrow
and
thought
with
painful
regret
of
the
glorious
days
when
her
great
ancestor
Ealfried
had
successfully
held
Ullathorne
against
a
Norman
invader
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
such
spirit
now
left
in
her
family
except
that
small
useless
spark
which
burnt
in
her
own
bosom
.
<EOS>
And
she
herself
,
was
not
she
at
this
moment
intent
on
entertaining
a
descendant
of
those
very
Normans
,
a
vain
proud
countess
with
a
Frenchified
name
who
would
only
think
that
she
graced
Ullathorne
too
highly
by
entering
its
portals
?
<EOS>
Was
it
likely
that
an
Honourable
John
,
the
son
of
an
Earl
De
Courcy
,
should
ride
at
a
quintain
in
company
with
Saxon
yeomen
?
<EOS>
And
why
should
she
expect
her
brother
to
do
that
which
her
brother
's
guests
would
decline
to
do
?
  
<EOS>
Some
dim
faint
idea
of
the
impracticability
of
her
own
views
flitted
across
her
brain
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
necessary
that
races
doomed
to
live
on
the
same
soil
should
give
way
to
each
other
and
adopt
each
other
's
pursuits
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
impossible
that
after
more
than
five
centuries
of
close
intercourse
,
Normans
should
remain
Normans
,
and
Saxons
,
Saxons
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
after
all
,
her
neighbours
were
wiser
than
herself
.
<EOS>
Such
ideas
did
occasionally
present
themselves
to
Miss
Thorne
's
mind
and
make
her
sad
enough
.
<EOS>
But
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
her
favourite
quintain
was
but
a
modern
copy
of
a
Norman
knight
's
amusement
,
an
adaptation
of
the
noble
tourney
to
the
tastes
and
habits
of
the
Saxon
yeomen
.
<EOS>
Of
this
she
was
ignorant
,
and
it
would
have
been
cruelty
to
instruct
her
.
  
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Thorne
saw
the
tear
in
her
eye
,
he
repented
himself
of
his
contemptuous
expression
.
<EOS>
By
him
also
it
was
recognized
as
a
binding
law
that
every
whim
of
his
sister
was
to
be
respected
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
perhaps
so
firm
in
his
observances
to
her
as
she
was
in
hers
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
his
intentions
were
equally
good
,
and
whenever
he
found
that
he
had
forgotten
them
,
it
was
matter
of
grief
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Monica
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
in
the
least
mean
to
speak
ill
of
the
game
.
<EOS>
When
I
called
it
a
rattletrap
,
I
merely
meant
that
it
was
so
for
a
man
of
my
age
.
<EOS>
You
know
you
always
forget
that
I
an't
a
young
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
sure
you
are
not
an
old
man
,
Wilfred
,
"
said
she
,
accepting
the
apology
in
her
heart
and
smiling
at
him
with
the
tear
still
on
her
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
was
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
or
thirty
,
"
continued
he
,
"
I
should
like
nothing
better
than
riding
at
the
quintain
all
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
not
too
old
to
hunt
or
to
shoot
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
can
jump
over
a
ditch
and
hedge
,
I
am
sure
you
could
turn
the
quintain
round
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
when
I
ride
over
the
hedges
,
my
dear
 
<EOS>
and
it
is
n't
very
often
<EOS>
I
do
that
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
do
ride
over
the
hedges
,
there
is
n't
any
bag
of
flour
coming
after
me
.
<EOS>
Think
how
I
'd
look
taking
the
countess
out
to
breakfast
with
the
back
of
my
head
all
covered
with
meal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
,
Thorne
said
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
She
did
n't
like
the
allusion
to
the
countess
.
<EOS>
She
could
n't
be
satisfied
with
the
reflection
that
the
sports
at
Ullathorne
should
be
interfered
with
by
the
personal
attentions
necessary
for
a
Lady
De
Courcy
.
<EOS>
But
she
saw
that
it
was
useless
for
her
to
push
the
matter
further
.
<EOS>
It
was
conceded
that
Mr.
Thorne
was
to
be
spared
the
quintain
,
and
Miss
Thorne
determined
to
trust
wholly
to
a
youthful
knight
of
hers
,
an
immense
favourite
,
who
,
as
she
often
declared
,
was
a
pattern
to
the
young
men
of
the
age
and
an
excellent
sample
of
an
English
yeoman
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
Farmer
Greenacre
's
eldest
son
,
who
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
had
from
his
earliest
years
taken
the
exact
measure
of
Miss
Thorne
's
foot
.
<EOS>
In
his
boyhood
he
had
never
failed
to
obtain
from
her
apples
,
pocket
-
money
,
and
forgiveness
for
his
numerous
trespasses
;
and
now
in
his
early
manhood
he
got
privileges
and
immunities
which
were
equally
valuable
.
<EOS>
He
was
allowed
a
day
or
two
's
shooting
in
September
;
he
schooled
the
squire
's
horses
;
got
slips
of
trees
out
of
the
orchard
and
roots
of
flowers
out
of
the
garden
;
and
had
the
fishing
of
the
little
river
altogether
in
his
own
hands
.
<EOS>
He
had
undertaken
to
come
mounted
on
a
nag
of
his
father
's
and
show
the
way
at
the
quintain
post
.
<EOS>
Whatever
young
Greenacre
did
the
others
would
do
after
him
.
<EOS>
The
juvenile
Lookalofts
might
stand
aloof
,
but
the
rest
of
the
youth
of
Ullathorne
would
be
sure
to
venture
if
Harry
Greenacre
showed
the
way
.
<EOS>
And
so
Miss
Thorne
made
up
her
mind
to
dispense
with
the
noble
Johns
and
Georges
and
trust
,
as
her
ancestors
had
done
before
her
,
to
the
thews
and
sinews
of
native
Ullathorne
growth
.
  
<EOS>
At
about
nine
the
lower
orders
began
to
congregate
in
the
paddock
and
park
,
under
the
surveillance
of
Mr.
Plomacy
and
the
head
gardener
and
head
groom
,
who
were
sworn
in
as
his
deputies
and
were
to
assist
him
in
keeping
the
peace
and
promoting
the
sports
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
younger
inhabitants
of
the
neighbourhood
,
thinking
that
they
could
not
have
too
much
of
a
good
thing
,
had
come
at
a
very
early
hour
,
and
the
road
between
the
house
and
the
church
had
been
thronged
for
some
time
before
the
gates
were
thrown
open
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
another
difficulty
of
huge
dimensions
arose
,
a
difficulty
which
Mr.
Plomacy
had
indeed
foreseen
and
for
which
he
was
in
some
sort
provided
.
<EOS>
Some
of
those
who
wished
to
share
Miss
Thorne
's
hospitality
were
not
so
particular
as
they
should
have
been
as
to
the
preliminary
ceremony
of
an
invitation
.
<EOS>
They
doubtless
conceived
that
they
had
been
overlooked
by
accident
,
and
instead
of
taking
this
in
dudgeon
,
as
their
betters
would
have
done
,
they
good
-
naturedly
put
up
with
the
slight
,
and
showed
that
they
did
so
by
presenting
themselves
at
the
gate
in
their
Sunday
best
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Plomacy
,
however
,
well
-
knew
who
were
welcome
and
who
were
not
.
<EOS>
To
some
,
even
though
uninvited
,
he
allowed
ingress
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
too
particular
,
Plomacy
,
"
his
mistress
had
said
,
"
especially
with
the
children
.
<EOS>
If
they
live
anywhere
near
,
let
them
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
Acting
on
this
hint
,
Mr.
Plomacy
did
let
in
many
an
eager
urchin
and
a
few
tidily
dressed
girls
with
their
swains
who
in
no
way
belonged
to
the
property
.
<EOS>
But
to
the
denizens
of
the
city
he
was
inexorable
.
<EOS>
Many
a
Barchester
apprentice
made
his
appearance
there
that
day
and
urged
with
piteous
supplication
that
he
had
been
working
all
the
week
in
making
saddles
and
boots
for
the
use
of
Ullathorne
,
in
compounding
doses
for
the
horses
,
or
cutting
up
carcasses
for
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
No
such
claim
was
allowed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Plomacy
knew
nothing
about
the
city
apprentices
;
he
was
to
admit
the
tenants
and
labourers
on
the
estate
;
Miss
Thorne
was
n't
going
to
take
in
the
whole
city
of
Barchester
;
and
so
on
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
before
the
day
was
half
over
,
all
this
was
found
to
be
useless
.
<EOS>
Almost
anybody
who
chose
to
come
made
his
way
into
the
park
,
and
the
care
of
the
guardians
was
transferred
to
the
tables
on
which
the
banquet
was
spread
.
<EOS>
Even
here
there
was
many
an
unauthorised
claimant
for
a
place
,
of
whom
it
was
impossible
to
get
quit
without
more
commotion
than
the
place
and
food
were
worth
.

The
trouble
in
civilized
life
of
entertaining
company
,
as
it
is
called
too
generally
without
much
regard
to
strict
veracity
,
is
so
great
that
it
can
not
but
be
matter
of
wonder
that
people
are
so
fond
of
attempting
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
difficult
to
ascertain
what
is
the
_
quid

<EOS>
If
they
who
give
such
laborious
parties
,
and
who
endure
such
toil
and
turmoil
in
the
vain
hope
of
giving
them
successfully
,
really
enjoyed
the
parties
given
by
others
,
the
matter
could
be
understood
.
<EOS>
A
sense
of
justice
would
induce
men
and
women
to
undergo
,
in
behalf
of
others
,
those
miseries
which
others
had
undergone
in
their
behalf
.
<EOS>
But
they
all
profess
that
going
out
is
as
great
a
bore
as
receiving
,
and
to
look
at
them
when
they
are
out
,
one
can
not

believe

who

A

can
sometimes
do
so

sometimes
a
dancer
in
short
petticoats

stuffed

occasionally

a

beyond
these

success

shall

These

<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
,
however
,
boldly
attempted
to
leave
the
modern
,
beaten
track
,
and
made
a
positive
effort
to
entertain
her
guests
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
She
did
so
with
but
moderate
success
.
<EOS>
They
had
all
their
own
way
of
going
,
and
would
not
go
her
way
.
<EOS>
She
piped
to
them
,
but
they
would
not
dance
.
<EOS>
She
offered
to
them
good
,
honest
household
cake
made
of
currants
and
flour
and
eggs
and
sweetmeat
,
but
they
would
feed
themselves
on
trashy
wafers
from
the
shop
of
the
Barchester
pastry
-
cook
,
on
chalk
and
gum
and
adulterated
sugar
.
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Thorne
!
<EOS>
Yours
is
not
the
first
honest
soul
that
has
vainly
striven
to
recall
the
glories
of
happy
days
gone
by
!
<EOS>
If
fashion
suggests
to
a
Lady
De
Courcy
that
,
when
invited
to
a
_
déjeuner
_
at
twelve
she
ought
to
come
at
three
,
no
eloquence
of
thine
will
teach
her
the
advantage
of
a
nearer
approach
to
punctuality
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
fondly
thought
that
when
she
called
on
her
friends
to
come
at
twelve
,
and
specially
begged
them
to
believe
that
she
meant
it
,
she
would
be
able
to
see
them
comfortably
seated
in
their
tents
at
two
.
<EOS>
Vain
woman
 
or
rather
ignorant
woman
 
ignorant
of
the
advances
of
that
civilization
which
the
world
had
witnessed
while
she
was
growing
old
.
<EOS>
At
twelve
she
found
herself
alone
,
dressed
in
all
the
glory
of
the
newest
of
her
many
suits
of
raiment
 
with
strong
shoes
however
,
and
a
serviceable
bonnet
on
her
head
,
and
a
warm
,
rich
shawl
on
her
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Thus
clad
,
she
peered
out
into
the
tent
,
went
to
the
ha
-
ha
,
and
satisfied
herself
that
at
any
rate
the
youngsters
were
amusing
themselves
,
spoke
a
word
to
Mrs.
Greenacre
over
the
ditch
,
and
took
one
look
at
the
quintain
.
<EOS>
Three
or
four
young
farmers
were
turning
the
machine
round
and
round
and
poking
at
the
bag
of
flour
in
a
manner
not
at
all
intended
by
the
inventor
of
the
game
;
but
no
mounted
sportsmen
were
there
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
looked
at
her
watch
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
fifteen
minutes
past
twelve
,
and
it
was
understood
that
Harry
Greenacre
was
not
to
begin
till
the
half
-
hour
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
returned
to
her
drawing
-
room
rather
quicker
than
was
her
wo
nt
,
fearing
that
the
countess
might
come
and
find
none
to
welcome
her
.
<EOS>
She
need
not
have
hurried
,
for
no
one
was
there
.
<EOS>
At
half
-
past
twelve
she
peeped
into
the
kitchen
;
at
a
quarter
to
one
she
was
joined
by
her
brother
;
and
just
then
the
first
fashionable
arrival
took
place
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clantantram
was
announced
.
  
<EOS>
No
announcement
was
necessary
,
indeed
,
for
the
good
lady
's
voice
was
heard
as
she
walked
across
the
courtyard
to
the
house
,
scolding
the
unfortunate
postilion
who
had
driven
her
from
Barchester
.
<EOS>
At
the
moment
Miss
Thorne
could
not
but
be
thankful
that
the
other
guests
were
more
fashionable
and
were
thus
spared
the
fury
of
Mrs.
Clantantram
's
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Miss
Thorne
,
look
here
!
"
said
she
as
soon
as
she
found
herself
in
the
drawing
-
room
;
"
do
look
at
my
roque
-
laure
.
<EOS>
It
's
clean
spoilt
,
and
forever
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
but
wear
it
because
I
knew
you
wished
us
all
to
be
grand
to
-
day
,
and
yet
I
had
my
misgivings
.
<EOS>
Oh
dear
,
oh
dear
!
<EOS>
It
was
five
-
and
-
twenty
shillings
a
yard
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Barchester
post
-
horses
had
misbehaved
in
some
unfortunate
manner
just
as
Mrs.
Clantantram
was
getting
out
of
the
chaise
and
had
nearly
thrown
her
under
the
wheel
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clantantram
belonged
to
other
days
,
and
therefore
,
though
she
had
but
little
else
to
recommend
her
,
Miss
Thorne
was
to
a
certain
extent
fond
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
sent
the
roque
-
laure
away
to
be
cleaned
,
and
lent
her
one
of
her
best
shawls
out
of
her
own
wardrobe
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
comer
was
Mr.
Arabin
,
who
was
immediately
informed
of
Mrs.
Clantantram
's
misfortune
and
of
her
determination
to
pay
neither
master
nor
post
-
boy
,
although
,
as
she
remarked
,
she
intended
to
get
her
lift
home
before
she
made
known
her
mind
upon
that
matter
.
<EOS>
Then
a
good
deal
of
rustling
was
heard
in
the
sort
of
lobby
that
was
used
for
the
ladies
"
outside
cloaks
,
and
the
door
having
been
thrown
wide
open
,
the
servant
announced
,
not
in
the
most
confident
of
voices
,
Mrs.
Lookaloft
,
and
the
Miss
Lookalofts
,
and
Mr.
Augustus
Lookaloft
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
man
!
 
<EOS>
we
mean
the
footman
.
<EOS>
He
knew
,
none
better
,
that
Mrs.
Lookaloft
had
no
business
there
,
that
she
was
not
wanted
there
,
and
would
not
be
welcome
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
not
the
courage
to
tell
a
stout
lady
with
a
low
dress
,
short
sleeves
,
and
satin
at
eight
shillings
a
yard
that
she
had
come
to
the
wrong
tent
;
he
had
not
dared
to
hint
to
young
ladies
with
white
dancing
shoes
and
long
gloves
that
there
was
a
place
ready
for
them
in
the
paddock
.
<EOS>
And
thus
Mrs.
Lookaloft
carried
her
point
,
broke
through
the
guards
,
and
made
her
way
into
the
citadel
.
<EOS>
That
she
would
have
to
pass
an
uncomfortable
time
there
<EOS>
she
had
surmised
before
.
<EOS>
But
nothing
now
could
rob
her
of
the
power
of
boasting
that
she
had
consorted
on
the
lawn
with
the
squire
and
Miss
Thorne
,
with
a
countess
,
a
bishop
,
and
the
county
grandees
,
while
Mrs.
Greenacre
and
such
-
like
were
walking
about
with
the
ploughboys
in
the
park
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
point
gained
by
Mrs.
Lookaloft
,
and
it
might
be
fairly
expected
that
from
this
time
forward
the
tradesmen
of
Barchester
would
,
with
undoubting
pens
,
address
her
husband
as
T.
Lookaloft
,
Esquire
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lookaloft
's
pluck
carried
her
through
everything
,
and
she
walked
triumphant
into
the
Ullathorne
drawing
-
room
;
but
her
children
did
feel
a
little
abashed
at
the
sort
of
reception
they
met
with
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
Miss
Thorne
's
heart
to
insult
her
own
guests
,
but
neither
was
it
in
her
disposition
to
overlook
such
effrontery
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mrs.
Lookaloft
,
is
this
you
?
"
said
she
.
"
<EOS>
And
your
daughters
and
son
?
<EOS>
Well
,
we
're
very
glad
to
see
you
,
but
I
'm
sorry
you
've
come
in
such
low
dresses
,
as
we
are
all
going
out
of
doors
.
<EOS>
Could
we
lend
you
anything
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
no
thank
ye
,
Miss
Thorne
,
"
said
the
mother
;
"
the
girls
and
myself
are
quite
used
to
low
dresses
,
when
we
're
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
,
indeed
?
"
said
Miss
Thorne
shuddering
 
but
the
shudder
was
lost
on
Mrs.
Lookaloft
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
's
Lookaloft
?
"
said
the
master
of
the
house
,
coming
up
to
welcome
his
tenant
's
wife
.
<EOS>
Let
the
faults
of
the
family
be
what
they
would
,
he
could
not
but
remember
that
their
rent
was
well
paid
;
he
was
therefore
not
willing
to
give
them
a
cold
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Such
a
headache
,
Mr.
Thorne
!
"
said
Mrs.
Lookaloft
.
<EOS>
"
In
fact
he
could
n't
stir
,
or
you
may
be
certain
on
such
a
day
he
would
not
have
absented
hisself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
"
said
Miss
Thorne
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
is
so
ill
,
I
'm
sure
you
'd
wish
to
be
with
him
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
at
all
!
"
said
Mrs.
Lookaloft
.
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
Miss
Thorne
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
bilious
you
know
,
and
when
he
's
that
way
,
he
can
bear
nobody
nigh
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
fact
,
however
,
was
that
Mr.
Lookaloft
,
having
either
more
sense
or
less
courage
than
his
wife
,
had
not
chosen
to
intrude
on
Miss
Thorne
's
drawing
-
room
,
and
as
he
could
not
very
well
have
gone
among
the
plebeians
while
his
wife
was
with
the
patricians
,
he
thought
it
most
expedient
to
remain
at
Rosebank
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lookaloft
soon
found
herself
on
a
sofa
,
and
the
Miss
Lookalofts
on
two
chairs
,
while
Mr.
Augustus
stood
near
the
door
;
and
here
they
remained
till
in
due
time
they
were
seated
,
all
four
together
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
dining
-
room
table
.
  
<EOS>
Then
the
Grantlys
came
 
the
archdeacon
and
Mrs.
Grantly
and
the
two
girls
,
and
Dr.
Gwynne
and
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
As
ill
-
luck
would
have
it
,
they
were
closely
followed
by
Dr.
Stanhope
's
carriage
.
<EOS>
As
Eleanor
looked
out
of
the
carriage
window
,
she
saw
her
brother
-
in
-
law
helping
the
ladies
out
and
threw
herself
back
into
her
seat
,
dreading
to
be
discovered
.
<EOS>
She
had
had
an
odious
journey
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
's
civility
had
been
more
than
ordinarily
greasy
;
and
now
,
though
he
had
not
in
fact
said
anything
which
she
could
notice
,
she
had
for
the
first
time
entertained
a
suspicion
that
he
was
intending
to
make
love
to
her
.
<EOS>
Was
it
after
all
true
that
she
had
been
conducting
herself
in
a
way
that
justified
the
world
in
thinking
that
she
liked
the
man
?
<EOS>
After
all
,
could
it
be
possible
that
the
archdeacon
and
Mr.
Arabin
were
right
,
and
that
she
was
wrong
?
<EOS>
Charlotte
Stanhope
had
also
been
watching
Mr.
Slope
and
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
behoved
her
brother
to
lose
no
further
time
,
if
he
meant
to
gain
the
widow
.
<EOS>
She
almost
regretted
that
it
had
not
been
contrived
that
Bertie
should
be
at
Ullathorne
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
did
not
see
his
sister
-
in
-
law
in
company
with
Mr.
Slope
,
but
Mr.
Arabin
did
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
came
out
with
Mr.
Thorne
to
the
front
door
to
welcome
Mrs.
Grantly
,
and
he
remained
in
the
courtyard
till
all
their
party
had
passed
on
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
hung
back
in
the
carriage
as
long
as
she
well
could
,
but
she
was
nearest
to
the
door
,
and
when
Mr.
Slope
,
having
alighted
,
offered
her
his
hand
,
she
had
no
alternative
but
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
standing
at
the
open
door
while
Mrs.
Grantly
was
shaking
hands
with
someone
within
,
saw
a
clergyman
alight
from
the
carriage
whom
he
at
once
knew
to
be
Mr.
Slope
,
and
then
he
saw
this
clergyman
hand
out
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
Having
seen
so
much
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
rather
sick
at
heart
,
followed
Mrs.
Grantly
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
was
,
however
,
spared
any
further
immediate
degradation
,
for
Dr.
Stanhope
gave
her
his
arm
across
the
courtyard
,
and
Mr.
Slope
was
fain
to
throw
away
his
attention
upon
Charlotte
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
hardly
passed
into
the
house
,
and
from
the
house
to
the
lawn
,
when
,
with
a
loud
rattle
and
such
noise
as
great
men
and
great
women
are
entitled
to
make
in
their
passage
through
the
world
,
the
Proudies
drove
up
.
<EOS>
It
was
soon
apparent
that
no
everyday
comer
was
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
One
servant
whispered
to
another
that
it
was
the
bishop
,
and
the
word
soon
ran
through
all
the
hangers
-
on
and
strange
grooms
and
coachmen
about
the
place
.
<EOS>
There
was
quite
a
little
cortège
to
see
the
bishop
and
his
"
lady
"
walk
across
the
courtyard
,
and
the
good
man
was
pleased
to
see
that
the
church
was
held
in
such
respect
in
the
parish
of
St.
Ewold
's
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
the
guests
came
fast
and
thick
,
and
the
lawn
began
to
be
crowded
,
and
the
room
to
be
full
.
<EOS>
Voices
buzzed
,
silk
rustled
against
silk
,
and
muslin
crumpled
against
muslin
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
became
more
happy
than
she
had
been
,
and
again
bethought
her
of
her
sports
.
<EOS>
There
were
targets
and
bows
and
arrows
prepared
at
the
further
end
of
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
Here
the
gardens
of
the
place
encroached
with
a
somewhat
wide
sweep
upon
the
paddock
and
gave
ample
room
for
the
doings
of
the
toxophilites
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
got
together
such
daughters
of
Diana
as
could
bend
a
bow
and
marshalled
them
to
the
targets
.
<EOS>
There
were
the
Grantly
girls
and
the
Proudie
girls
and
the
Chadwick
girls
,
and
the
two
daughters
of
the
burly
chancellor
,
and
Miss
Knowle
;
and
with
them
went
Frederick
and
Augustus
Chadwick
,
and
young
Knowle
of
Knowle
Park
,
and
Frank
Foster
of
the
Elms
,
and
Mr.
Vellem
Deeds
,
the
dashing
attorney
of
the
High
Street
,
and
the
Rev.
Mr.
Green
,
and
the
Rev.
Mr.
Brown
,
and
the
Rev.
Mr.
White
,
all
of
whom
,
as
in
duty
bound
,
attended
the
steps
of
the
three
Miss
Proudies
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
ride
at
the
quintain
,
Mr.
Foster
?
"
said
Miss
Thorne
as
she
walked
with
her
party
across
the
lawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
quintain
?
<EOS>
"
said
young
Foster
,
who
considered
himself
a
dab
at
horsemanship
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
it
a
sort
of
gate
,
Miss
Thorne
?
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
had
to
explain
the
noble
game
she
spoke
of
,
and
Frank
Foster
had
to
own
that
he
never
had
ridden
at
the
quintain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
like
to
come
and
see
?
"
said
Miss
Thorne
.
<EOS>
"
There
'll
be
plenty
here
you
know
without
you
,
if
you
like
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
do
n't
mind
,
"
said
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
the
ladies
can
come
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
said
Miss
Thorne
;
"
those
who
like
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
they
'll
go
to
see
your
prowess
<EOS>
,
if
you
'll
ride
,
Mr.
Foster
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Foster
looked
down
at
a
most
unexceptionable
pair
of
pantaloons
,
which
had
arrived
from
London
only
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
They
were
the
very
things
,
at
least
he
thought
so
,
for
a
picnic
or
fête
champêtre
,
but
he
was
not
prepared
to
ride
in
them
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
more
encouraged
than
had
been
Mr.
Thorne
by
the
idea
of
being
attacked
from
behind
by
the
bag
of
flour
,
which
Miss
Thorne
had
graphically
described
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
about
riding
,
Miss
Thorne
,
"
said
he
<EOS>
;
"
I
fear
I
'm
not
quite
prepared
.
"
  
Miss
Thorne
sighed
but
said
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
She
left
the
toxophilites
to
their
bows
and
arrows
and
returned
towards
the
house
.
<EOS>
But
as
she
passed
by
the
entrance
to
the
small
park
,
she
thought
that
she
might
at
any
rate
encourage
the
yeomen
by
her
presence
,
as
she
could
not
induce
her
more
fashionable
guests
to
mix
with
them
in
their
manly
amusements
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
she
once
more
betook
herself
to
the
quintain
post
.
  
<EOS>
Here
to
her
great
delight
she
found
Harry
Greenacre
ready
mounted
,
with
his
pole
in
his
hand
,
and
a
lot
of
comrades
standing
round
him
,
encouraging
him
to
the
assault
.
<EOS>
She
stood
at
a
little
distance
and
nodded
to
him
in
token
of
her
good
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
begin
,
ma'am
?
"
said
Harry
,
fingering
his
long
staff
in
a
rather
awkward
way
,
while
his
horse
moved
uneasily
beneath
him
,
not
accustomed
to
a
rider
armed
with
such
a
weapon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
said
Miss
Thorne
,
standing
triumphant
as
the
queen
of
beauty
on
an
inverted
tub
which
some
chance
had
brought
thither
from
the
farmyard
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
goes
then
,
"
said
Harry
as
he
wheeled
his
horse
round
to
get
the
necessary
momentum
of
a
sharp
gallop
.
<EOS>
The
quintain
post
stood
right
before
him
,
and
the
square
board
at
which
he
was
to
tilt
was
fairly
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
If
he
hit
that
duly
in
the
middle
,
and
maintained
his
pace
as
he
did
so
,
it
was
calculated
that
he
would
be
carried
out
of
reach
of
the
flour
bag
,
which
,
suspended
at
the
other
end
of
the
cross
-
bar
on
the
post
,
would
swing
round
when
the
board
was
struck
.
<EOS>
It
was
also
calculated
that
if
the
rider
did
not
maintain
his
pace
,
he
would
get
a
blow
from
the
flour
bag
just
at
the
back
of
his
head
,
and
bear
about
him
the
signs
of
his
awkwardness
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
lookers
-
on
.
  
<EOS>
Harry
Greenacre
did
not
object
to
being
powdered
with
flour
in
the
service
of
his
mistress
and
therefore
gallantly
touched
his
steed
with
his
spur
,
having
laid
his
lance
in
rest
to
the
best
of
his
ability
.
<EOS>
But
his
ability
in
this
respect
was
not
great
,
and
his
appurtenances
probably
not
very
good
;
consequently
,
he
struck
his
horse
with
his
pole
unintentionally
on
the
side
of
the
head
as
he
started
.
<EOS>
The
animal
swerved
and
shied
and
galloped
off
wide
of
the
quintain
.
<EOS>
Harry
,
well
-
accustomed
to
manage
a
horse
,
but
not
to
do
so
with
a
twelve
-
foot
rod
on
his
arm
,
lowered
his
right
hand
to
the
bridle
,
and
thus
the
end
of
the
lance
came
to
the
ground
and
got
between
the
legs
of
the
steed
.
<EOS>
Down
came
rider
and
steed
and
staff
.
<EOS>
Young
Greenacre
was
thrown
some
six
feet
over
the
horse
's
head
,
and
poor
Miss
Thorne
almost
fell
off
her
tub
in
a
swoon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
gracious
,
he
's
killed
,
"
shrieked
a
woman
who
was
near
him
when
he
fell
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Lord
be
good
to
him
!
<EOS>
His
poor
mother
,
his
poor
mother
!
"
said
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
drat
them
dangerous
plays
all
the
world
over
,
"
said
an
old
crone
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
broke
his
neck
sure
enough
,
if
ever
man
did
,
"
said
a
fourth
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Thorne
.
<EOS>
She
heard
all
this
and
yet
did
not
quite
swoon
.
<EOS>
She
made
her
way
through
the
crowd
as
best
she
could
,
sick
herself
almost
to
death
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
his
mother
 
his
poor
mother
!
<EOS>
How
could
she
ever
forgive
herself
.
<EOS>
The
agony
of
that
moment
was
terrific
.
<EOS>
She
could
hardly
get
to
the
place
where
the
poor
lad
was
lying
,
as
three
or
four
men
in
front
were
about
the
horse
,
which
had
risen
with
some
difficulty
,
but
at
last
she
found
herself
close
to
the
young
farmer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
he
marked
himself
?
<EOS>
For
heaven
's
sake
tell
me
that
:
has
he
marked
his
knees
?
"
said
Harry
,
slowly
rising
and
rubbing
his
left
shoulder
with
his
right
hand
and
thinking
only
of
his
horse
's
legs
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
soon
found
that
he
had
not
broken
his
neck
,
nor
any
of
his
bones
,
nor
been
injured
in
any
essential
way
.
<EOS>
But
from
that
time
forth
she
never
instigated
anyone
to
ride
at
a
quintain
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
left
Dr.
Stanhope
as
soon
as
she
could
do
so
civilly
and
went
in
quest
of
her
father
,
whom
she
found
on
the
lawn
in
company
with
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
sorry
to
find
them
together
.
<EOS>
She
was
anxious
to
disabuse
at
any
rate
her
father
's
mind
as
to
this
report
which
had
got
abroad
respecting
her
,
and
would
have
been
well
pleased
to
have
been
able
to
do
the
same
with
regard
to
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
She
put
her
own
through
her
father
's
arm
,
coming
up
behind
his
back
,
and
then
tendered
her
hand
also
to
the
vicar
of
St.
Ewold
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
did
you
come
?
"
said
Mr.
Harding
,
when
the
first
greeting
was
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Stanhopes
brought
me
,
"
said
she
;
"
their
carriage
was
obliged
to
come
twice
,
and
has
now
gone
back
for
the
signora
.
<EOS>
"
As
she
spoke
she
caught
Mr.
Arabin
's
eye
and
saw
that
he
was
looking
pointedly
at
her
with
a
severe
expression
.
<EOS>
She
understood
at
once
the
accusation
contained
in
his
glance
.
<EOS>
It
said
as
plainly
as
an
eye
could
speak
,
"
Yes
,
you
came
with
the
Stanhopes
,
but
you
did
so
in
order
that
you
might
be
in
company
with
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Our
party
,
"
said
she
,
still
addressing
her
father
,
"
consisted
of
the
doctor
and
Charlotte
Stanhope
,
myself
,
and
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
As
she
mentioned
the
last
name
she
felt
her
father
's
arm
quiver
slightly
beneath
her
touch
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
Mr.
Arabin
turned
away
from
them
and
,
joining
his
hands
behind
his
back
,
strolled
slowly
away
by
one
of
the
paths
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
,
"
said
she
,
"
it
was
impossible
to
help
coming
in
the
same
carriage
with
Mr.
Slope
;
it
was
quite
impossible
.
<EOS>
I
had
promised
to
come
with
them
before
I
dreamt
of
his
coming
,
and
afterwards
I
could
not
get
out
of
it
without
explaining
and
giving
rise
to
talk
.
<EOS>
You
were
n't
at
home
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
possibly
help
it
.
"
<EOS>
She
said
all
this
so
quickly
that
by
the
time
her
apology
was
spoken
she
was
quite
out
of
breath
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
why
you
should
have
wished
to
help
it
,
my
dear
,
"
said
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Papa
,
you
do
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
you
do
know
all
the
things
they
said
at
Plumstead
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
do
.
<EOS>
You
know
all
the
archdeacon
said
.
<EOS>
How
unjust
he
was
;
and
Mr.
Arabin
too
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
horrid
man
,
a
horrid
odious
man
,
but
 
"
  
"
Who
is
an
odious
man
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
but
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
mean
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
He
's
the
most
odious
man
I
ever
met
in
my
life
,
and
it
was
most
unfortunate
<EOS>
my
having
to
come
here
in
the
same
carriage
with
him
.
<EOS>
But
how
could
I
help
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
great
weight
began
to
move
itself
off
Mr.
Harding
's
mind
.
<EOS>
So
,
after
all
,
the
archdeacon
with
all
his
wisdom
,
and
Mrs.
Grantly
with
all
her
tact
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
with
all
his
talent
,
were
in
the
wrong
.
<EOS>
His
own
child
,
his
Eleanor
,
the
daughter
of
whom
he
was
so
proud
,
was
not
to
become
the
wife
of
a
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
about
to
give
his
sanction
to
the
marriage
,
so
certified
had
he
been
of
the
fact
,
and
now
he
learnt
that
this
imputed
lover
of
Eleanor
's
was
at
any
rate
as
much
disliked
by
her
as
by
any
one
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
,
however
,
was
by
no
means
sufficiently
a
man
of
the
world
to
conceal
the
blunder
he
had
made
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
pretend
that
he
had
entertained
no
suspicion
;
he
could
not
make
believe
that
he
had
never
joined
the
archdeacon
in
his
surmises
.
<EOS>
He
was
greatly
surprised
,
and
gratified
beyond
measure
,
and
he
could
not
help
showing
that
such
was
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
darling
girl
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
am
so
delighted
,
so
overjoyed
.
<EOS>
My
own
child
;
you
have
taken
such
a
weight
off
my
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
surely
,
Papa
,
_
you
_
did
n't
think
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
what
to
think
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
told
me
that
 
"
  
"
The
archdeacon
!
"
<EOS>
said
Eleanor
,
her
face
lighting
up
with
passion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
man
like
the
archdeacon
might
,
one
would
think
,
be
better
employed
than
in
traducing
his
sister
-
in
-
law
and
creating
bitterness
between
a
father
and
his
daughter
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
n't
mean
to
do
that
,
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
mean
then
?
<EOS>
Why
did
he
interfere
with
me
and
fill
your
mind
with
such
falsehood
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
it
now
,
my
child
;
never
mind
it
now
.
<EOS>
We
shall
all
know
you
better
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Papa
,
that
you
should
have
thought
it
!
<EOS>
That
you
should
have
suspected
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
by
suspicion
,
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
There
would
be
nothing
disgraceful
,
you
know
,
nothing
wrong
in
such
a
marriage
.
<EOS>
Nothing
that
could
have
justified
my
interfering
as
your
father
.
"
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Harding
would
have
proceeded
in
his
own
defence
to
make
out
that
Mr.
Slope
after
all
was
a
very
good
sort
of
man
and
a
very
fitting
second
husband
for
a
young
widow
,
had
he
not
been
interrupted
by
Eleanor
's
greater
energy
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
disgraceful
,
"
said
she
;
"
it
would
be
wrong
;
it
would
be
abominable
.
<EOS>
Could
I
do
such
a
horrid
thing
,
I
should
expect
no
one
to
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
Ugh
 
"
and
she
shuddered
as
she
thought
of
the
matrimonial
torch
which
her
friends
had
been
so
ready
to
light
on
her
behalf
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
wonder
at
Dr.
Grantly
;
I
do
n't
wonder
at
Susan
;
but
,
oh
,
Papa
,
I
do
wonder
at
you
.
<EOS>
How
could
you
,
how
could
you
believe
it
?
"
<EOS>
Poor
Eleanor
,
as
she
thought
of
her
father
's
defalcation
,
could
resist
her
tears
no
longer
,
and
was
forced
to
cover
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
.
  
<EOS>
The
place
was
not
very
opportune
for
her
grief
.
<EOS>
They
were
walking
through
the
shrubberies
,
and
there
were
many
people
near
them
.
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Harding
stammered
out
his
excuse
as
best
he
could
,
and
Eleanor
with
an
effort
controlled
her
tears
and
returned
her
handkerchief
to
her
pocket
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
find
it
difficult
to
forgive
her
father
,
nor
could
she
altogether
refuse
to
join
him
in
the
returning
gaiety
of
spirit
to
which
her
present
avowal
gave
rise
.
<EOS>
It
was
such
a
load
off
his
heart
to
think
that
he
should
not
be
called
on
to
welcome
Mr.
Slope
as
his
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
It
was
such
a
relief
to
him
to
find
that
his
daughter
's
feelings
and
his
own
were
now
,
as
they
ever
had
been
,
in
unison
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
so
unhappy
for
the
last
six
weeks
about
this
wretched
Mr.
Slope
!
<EOS>
He
was
so
indifferent
as
to
the
loss
of
the
hospital
,
so
thankful
for
the
recovery
of
his
daughter
,
that
,
strong
as
was
the
ground
for
Eleanor
's
anger
<EOS>
,
she
could
not
find
it
in
her
heart
to
be
long
angry
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Papa
,
"
she
said
,
hanging
closely
to
his
arm
,
"
never
suspect
me
again
:
promise
me
that
you
never
will
.
<EOS>
Whatever
I
do
you
may
be
sure
I
shall
tell
you
first
;
you
may
be
sure
I
shall
consult
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Harding
did
promise
,
and
owned
his
sin
,
and
promised
again
.
<EOS>
And
so
,
while
he
promised
amendment
and
she
uttered
forgiveness
,
they
returned
together
to
the
drawing
-
room
windows
.
  
<EOS>
And
what
had
Eleanor
meant
when
she
declared
that
_
whatever
she
did
_
,
she
would
tell
her
father
first
?
<EOS>
What
was
she
thinking
of
doing
?
  
<EOS>
So
ended
the
first
act
of
the
melodrama
which
Eleanor
was
called
on
to
perform
this
day
at
Ullathorne
.
   
<EOS>
The
Signora
Neroni
,
the
Countess
De
Courcy
,
and
Mrs.
Proudie
Meet
Each
Other
at
Ullathorne
 
<EOS>
And
now
there
were
new
arrivals
.
<EOS>
Just
as
Eleanor
reached
the
drawing
-
room
the
signora
was
being
wheeled
into
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
brought
out
of
the
carriage
into
the
dining
-
room
and
there
placed
on
a
sofa
,
and
was
now
in
the
act
of
entering
the
other
room
,
by
the
joint
aid
of
her
brother
and
sister
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
and
two
servants
in
livery
.
<EOS>
She
was
all
in
her
glory
,
and
looked
so
pathetically
happy
,
so
full
of
affliction
and
grace
,
was
so
beautiful
,
so
pitiable
,
and
so
charming
that
it
was
almost
impossible
not
to
be
glad
she
was
there
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
was
unaffectedly
glad
to
welcome
her
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
signora
was
a
sort
of
lion
;
and
though
there
was
no
drop
of
the
Leohunter
blood
in
Miss
Thorne
's
veins
,
she
nevertheless
did
like
to
see
attractive
people
at
her
house
.
<EOS>
The
signora
was
attractive
,
and
on
her
first
settlement
in
the
dining
-
room
she
had
whispered
two
or
three
soft
feminine
words
into
Miss
Thorne
's
ear
which
,
at
the
moment
,
had
quite
touched
that
lady
's
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Miss
Thorne
;
where
is
Miss
Thorne
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
as
soon
as
her
attendants
had
placed
her
in
her
position
just
before
one
of
the
windows
,
from
whence
she
could
see
all
that
was
going
on
upon
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
am
I
to
thank
you
for
permitting
a
creature
like
me
to
be
here
?
<EOS>
But
if
you
knew
the
pleasure
you
give
me
,
I
am
sure
you
would
excuse
the
trouble
I
bring
with
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
she
spoke
she
squeezed
the
spinster
's
little
hand
between
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
delighted
to
see
you
here
,
"
said
Miss
Thorne
;
"
you
give
us
no
trouble
at
all
,
and
we
think
it
a
great
favour
conferred
by
you
to
come
and
see
us
 
<EOS>
do
n't
we
,
Wilfred
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
great
favour
indeed
,
"
said
Mr.
Thorne
with
a
gallant
bow
but
of
a
somewhat
less
cordial
welcome
than
that
conceded
by
his
sister
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
had
heard
perhaps
more
of
the
antecedents
of
his
guest
than
his
sister
had
done
,
and
had
not
as
yet
undergone
the
power
of
the
signora
's
charms
.
  
<EOS>
But
while
the
mother
of
the
last
of
the
Neros
was
thus
in
her
full
splendour
,
with
crowds
of
people
gazing
at
her
and
the
élite
of
the
company
standing
round
her
couch
,
her
glory
was
paled
by
the
arrival
of
the
Countess
De
Courcy
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
had
now
been
waiting
three
hours
for
the
countess
,
and
could
not
therefore
but
show
very
evident
gratification
when
the
arrival
at
last
took
place
.
<EOS>
She
and
her
brother
of
course
went
off
to
welcome
the
titled
grandees
,
and
with
them
,
alas
,
went
many
of
the
signora
's
admirers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Thorne
,
"
said
the
countess
,
while
in
the
act
of
being
disrobed
of
her
fur
cloaks
and
rerobed
in
her
gauze
shawls
,
"
what
dreadful
roads
you
have
;
perfectly
frightful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
happened
that
Mr.
Thorne
was
waywarden
for
the
district
and
,
not
liking
the
attack
,
began
to
excuse
his
roads
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
indeed
they
are
,
"
said
the
countess
not
minding
him
in
the
least
;
"
perfectly
dreadful
 
<EOS>
are
they
not
,
Margaretta
?
<EOS>
Why
,
my
dear
Miss
Thorne
,
we
left
Courcy
Castle
just
at
eleven
;
it
was
only
just
past
eleven
,
was
it
not
,
George
?
<EOS>
And
 
"
  
"
Just
past
one
I
think
you
mean
,
"
said
the
Honourable
George
,
turning
from
the
group
and
eyeing
the
signora
through
his
glass
.
<EOS>
The
signora
gave
him
back
his
own
,
as
the
saying
is
,
and
more
with
it
,
so
that
the
young
nobleman
was
forced
to
avert
his
glance
and
drop
his
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Thorne
,
"
whispered
he
,
"
who
the
deuce
is
that
on
the
sofa
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Dr.
Stanhope
's
daughter
,
"
whispered
back
Mr.
Thorne
.
"
<EOS>
Signora
Neroni
,
she
calls
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whew
 
ew
 
ew
!
"
whistled
the
Honourable
George
.
"
<EOS>
The
devil
she
is
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
no
end
of
stories
about
that
filly
.
<EOS>
You
must
positively
introduce
me
,
Thorne
;
you
positively
must
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
,
who
was
respectability
itself
,
did
not
quite
like
having
a
guest
about
whom
the
Honourable
George
De
Courcy
had
heard
no
end
of
stories
,
but
he
could
n't
help
himself
.
<EOS>
He
merely
resolved
that
before
he
went
to
bed
he
would
let
his
sister
know
somewhat
of
the
history
of
the
lady
she
was
so
willing
to
welcome
.
<EOS>
The
innocence
of
Miss
Thorne
at
her
time
of
life
was
perfectly
charming
,
but
even
innocence
may
be
dangerous
.
  
<EOS>
"
George
may
say
what
he
likes
,
"
continued
the
countess
,
urging
her
excuses
to
Miss
Thorne
;
"
I
am
sure
we
were
past
the
castle
gate
before
twelve
 
were
n't
we
,
Margaretta
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Upon
my
word
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
the
Lady
Margaretta
,
"
for
I
was
half
-
asleep
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
know
that
I
was
called
some
time
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
was
dressing
myself
before
daylight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Wise
people
,
when
they
are
in
the
wrong
,
always
put
themselves
right
by
finding
fault
with
the
people
against
whom
they
have
sinned
.
<EOS>
Lady
De
Courcy
was
a
wise
woman
,
and
therefore
,
having
treated
Miss
Thorne
very
badly
by
staying
away
till
three
o'clock
,
she
assumed
the
offensive
and
attacked
Mr.
Thorne
's
roads
.
<EOS>
Her
daughter
,
not
less
wise
,
attacked
Miss
Thorne
's
early
hours
.
<EOS>
The
art
of
doing
this
is
among
the
most
precious
of
those
usually
cultivated
by
persons
who
know
how
to
live
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
withstanding
it
.
<EOS>
Who
can
go
systematically
to
work
and
,
having
done
battle
with
the
primary
accusation
and
settled
that
,
then
bring
forward
a
countercharge
and
support
that
also
?
<EOS>
Life
is
not
long
enough
for
such
labours
.
<EOS>
A
man
in
the
right
relies
easily
on
his
rectitude
and
therefore
goes
about
unarmed
.
<EOS>
His
very
strength
is
his
weakness
.
<EOS>
A
man
in
the
wrong
knows
that
he
must
look
to
his
weapons
;
his
very
weakness
is
his
strength
.
<EOS>
The
one
is
never
prepared
for
combat
,
the
other
is
always
ready
.
<EOS>
Therefore
it
is
that
in
this
world
the
man
that
is
in
the
wrong
almost
invariably
conquers
the
man
that
is
in
the
right
,
and
invariably
despises
him
.
  
<EOS>
A
man
must
be
an
idiot
or
else
an
angel
who
,
after
the
age
of
forty
,
shall
attempt
to
be
just
to
his
neighbours
.
<EOS>
Many
like
the
Lady
Margaretta
have
learnt
their
lesson
at
a
much
earlier
age
.
<EOS>
But
this
of
course
depends
on
the
school
in
which
they
have
been
taught
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Thorne
was
altogether
overcome
.
<EOS>
She
knew
very
well
that
she
had
been
ill
-
treated
,
and
yet
she
found
herself
making
apologies
to
Lady
De
Courcy
.
<EOS>
To
do
her
ladyship
justice
,
she
received
them
very
graciously
,
and
allowed
herself
,
with
her
train
of
daughters
,
to
be
led
towards
the
lawn
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
two
windows
in
the
drawing
-
room
wide
open
for
the
countess
to
pass
through
,
but
she
saw
that
there
was
a
woman
on
a
sofa
,
at
the
third
window
,
and
that
that
woman
had
,
as
it
were
,
a
following
attached
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
therefore
determined
to
investigate
the
woman
.
<EOS>
The
De
Courcy
's
were
hereditarily
shortsighted
,
and
had
been
so
for
thirty
centuries
at
least
.
<EOS>
So
Lady
De
Courcy
,
who
when
she
entered
the
family
had
adopted
the
family
habits
,
did
as
her
son
had
done
before
her
and
,
taking
her
glass
to
investigate
the
Signora
Neroni
,
pressed
in
among
the
gentlemen
who
surrounded
the
couch
,
and
bowed
slightly
to
those
whom
she
chose
to
honour
by
her
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
In
order
to
get
to
the
window
she
had
to
pass
close
to
the
front
of
the
couch
,
and
as
she
did
so
she
stared
hard
at
the
occupant
.
<EOS>
The
occupant
,
in
return
,
stared
hard
at
the
countess
.
<EOS>
The
countess
,
who
,
since
her
countess
-
ship
commenced
,
had
been
accustomed
to
see
all
eyes
not
royal
,
ducal
,
or
marquesal
fall
before
her
own
,
paused
as
she
went
on
,
raised
her
eyebrows
,
and
stared
even
harder
than
before
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
now
to
do
with
one
who
cared
little
for
countesses
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
one
may
say
,
impossible
for
mortal
man
or
woman
to
abash
Madeline
Neroni
.
<EOS>
She
opened
her
large
,
bright
,
lustrous
eyes
wider
and
wider
,
till
she
seemed
to
be
all
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
gazed
up
into
the
lady
's
face
,
not
as
though
she
did
it
with
an
effort
,
but
as
if
she
delighted
in
doing
it
.
<EOS>
She
used
no
glass
to
assist
her
effrontery
,
and
needed
none
.
<EOS>
The
faintest
possible
smile
of
derision
played
round
her
mouth
,
and
her
nostrils
were
slightly
dilated
,
as
if
in
sure
anticipation
of
her
triumph
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
sure
.
<EOS>
The
Countess
De
Courcy
,
in
spite
of
her
thirty
centuries
and
De
Courcy
Castle
,
and
the
fact
that
Lord
De
Courcy
was
grand
master
of
the
ponies
to
the
Prince
of
Wales
,
had
not
a
chance
with
her
.
<EOS>
At
first
the
little
circlet
of
gold
wavered
in
the
countess
's
hand
,
then
the
hand
shook
,
then
the
circlet
fell
,
the
countess
's
head
tossed
itself
into
the
air
,
and
the
countess
's
feet
shambled
out
to
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
,
however
,
go
so
fast
but
what
she
heard
the
signora
's
voice
,
asking
:
  
"
Who
on
earth
is
that
woman
,
Mr.
Slope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
Lady
De
Courcy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
ah
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
supposed
so
.
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
.
<EOS>
Well
,
that
's
as
good
as
a
play
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
as
good
as
a
play
to
any
there
who
had
eyes
to
observe
it
and
wit
to
comment
on
what
they
observed
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
Lady
De
Courcy
soon
found
a
congenial
spirit
on
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
There
she
encountered
Mrs.
Proudie
,
and
as
Mrs.
Proudie
was
not
only
the
wife
of
a
bishop
but
was
also
the
cousin
of
an
earl
,
Lady
De
Courcy
considered
her
to
be
the
fittest
companion
she
was
likely
to
meet
in
that
assemblage
.
<EOS>
They
were
accordingly
delighted
to
see
each
other
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
by
no
means
despised
a
countess
,
and
as
this
countess
lived
in
the
county
and
within
a
sort
of
extensive
visiting
distance
of
Barchester
,
she
was
glad
to
have
this
opportunity
of
ingratiating
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Lady
De
Courcy
,
I
am
so
delighted
,
"
said
she
,
looking
as
little
grim
as
it
was
in
her
nature
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
expected
to
see
you
here
.
<EOS>
It
is
such
a
distance
,
and
then
,
you
know
,
such
a
crowd
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
such
roads
,
Mrs.
Proudie
!
<EOS>
I
really
wonder
how
the
people
ever
get
about
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
suppose
they
ever
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
really
do
n't
know
,
but
I
suppose
not
.
<EOS>
The
Thornes
do
n't
,
I
know
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
nice
person
,
Miss
Thorne
,
is
n't
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
delightful
,
and
so
queer
;
I
've
known
her
these
twenty
years
.
<EOS>
A
great
pet
of
mine
is
dear
Miss
Thorne
.
<EOS>
She
is
so
very
strange
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
She
always
makes
me
think
of
the
Eskimos
and
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
Is
n't
her
dress
quite
delightful
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Delightful
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
now
whether
she
paints
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
see
such
colour
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
of
course
,
"
said
Lady
De
Courcy
;
"
that
is
,
I
have
no
doubt
she
does
.
<EOS>
But
,
Mrs.
Proudie
,
who
is
that
woman
on
the
sofa
by
the
window
?
<EOS>
Just
step
this
way
and
you
'll
see
her
,
there
 
"
and
the
countess
led
her
to
a
spot
where
she
could
plainly
see
the
signora
's
well
-
remembered
face
and
figure
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
however
do
so
without
being
equally
well
seen
by
the
signora
.
<EOS>
"
Look
,
look
,
"
said
that
lady
to
Mr.
Slope
,
who
was
still
standing
near
to
her
;
"
see
the
high
spiritualities
and
temporalities
of
the
land
in
league
together
,
and
all
against
poor
me
.
<EOS>
I
'll
wager
my
bracelet
,
Mr.
Slope
,
against
your
next
sermon
that
they
've
taken
up
their
position
there
on
purpose
to
pull
me
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
ca
n't
rush
to
the
combat
,
but
I
know
how
to
protect
myself
if
the
enemy
come
near
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
enemy
knew
better
.
<EOS>
They
could
gain
nothing
by
contact
with
the
Signora
Neroni
,
and
they
could
abuse
her
as
they
pleased
at
a
distance
from
her
on
the
lawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
that
horrid
Italian
woman
,
Lady
De
Courcy
;
you
must
have
heard
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
Italian
woman
?
"
said
her
ladyship
,
quite
alive
to
the
coming
story
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
've
heard
of
any
Italian
woman
coming
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
She
does
n't
look
Italian
,
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
must
have
heard
of
her
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
she
's
not
absolutely
Italian
.
<EOS>
She
is
Dr.
Stanhope
's
daughter
 
Dr.
Stanhope
the
prebendary
 
<EOS>
and
she
calls
herself
the
Signora
Neroni
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
-
h
-
h
-
h
!
"
exclaimed
the
countess
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
sure
you
had
heard
of
her
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
her
husband
.
<EOS>
They
do
say
that
some
man
named
Neroni
is
still
alive
.
<EOS>
I
believe
she
did
marry
such
a
man
abroad
,
but
I
do
not
at
all
know
who
or
what
he
was
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
-
h
-
h
-
h
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
countess
,
shaking
her
head
with
much
intelligence
,
as
every
additional
"
h
"
fell
from
her
lips
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
all
about
it
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
George
mention
her
.
<EOS>
George
knows
all
about
her
.
<EOS>
George
heard
about
her
in
Rome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
an
abominable
woman
,
at
any
rate
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Insufferable
,
"
said
the
countess
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
made
her
way
into
the
palace
once
,
before
I
knew
anything
about
her
,
and
I
can
not
tell
you
how
dreadfully
indecent
her
conduct
was
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
?
"
said
the
delighted
countess
.
  
<EOS>
"
Insufferable
,
"
said
the
prelatess
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
does
she
lie
on
a
sofa
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Lady
De
Courcy
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
only
one
leg
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Proudie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
one
leg
!
"
said
Lady
De
Courcy
,
who
felt
to
a
certain
degree
dissatisfied
that
the
signora
was
thus
incapacitated
.
<EOS>
"
Was
she
born
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
 
and
<EOS>
her
ladyship
felt
some
what
recomforted
by
the
assurance
 
<EOS>
"
she
had
two
.
<EOS>
But
that
Signor
Neroni
beat
her
,
I
believe
,
till
she
was
obliged
to
have
one
amputated
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
she
entirely
lost
the
use
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Unfortunate
creature
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
countess
,
who
herself
knew
something
of
matrimonial
trials
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
,
"
one
would
pity
her
in
spite
of
her
past
bad
conduct
,
if
she
now
knew
how
to
behave
herself
.
<EOS>
But
she
does
not
.
<EOS>
She
is
the
most
insolent
creature
I
ever
put
my
eyes
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
she
is
,
"
said
Lady
De
Courcy
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
her
conduct
with
men
is
so
abominable
that
she
is
not
fit
to
be
admitted
into
any
lady
's
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
said
the
countess
,
becoming
again
excited
,
happy
and
merciless
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
saw
that
man
standing
near
her
 
the
clergyman
with
the
red
hair
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
absolutely
ruined
that
man
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
 
<EOS>
or
I
should
rather
take
the
blame
on
myself
,
<EOS>
for
it
was
I
 
<EOS>
I
brought
him
down
from
London
to
Barchester
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
tolerable
preacher
,
an
active
young
man
,
and
I
therefore
introduced
him
to
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
That
woman
,
Lady
De
Courcy
,
has
got
hold
of
him
and
has
so
disgraced
him
that
I
am
forced
to
require
that
he
shall
leave
the
palace
;
and
I
doubt
very
much
whether
he
wo
n't
lose
his
gown
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
an
idiot
the
man
must
be
!
"
said
the
countess
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
the
intriguing
villainy
of
that
woman
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
,
remembering
her
torn
flounces
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
say
she
has
only
got
one
leg
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
as
full
of
mischief
as
tho
"
she
had
ten
.
<EOS>
Look
at
her
eyes
,
Lady
De
Courcy
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
see
such
eyes
in
a
decent
woman
's
head
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
I
never
did
,
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
her
effrontery
,
and
her
voice
!
<EOS>
I
quite
pity
her
poor
father
,
who
is
really
a
good
sort
of
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dr.
Stanhope
,
is
n't
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Dr.
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
He
is
one
of
our
prebendaries
 
a
good
,
quiet
sort
of
man
himself
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
surprised
that
he
should
let
his
daughter
conduct
herself
as
she
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
ca
n't
help
it
,
"
said
the
countess
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
a
clergyman
,
you
know
,
Lady
De
Courcy
!
<EOS>
He
should
at
any
rate
prevent
her
from
exhibiting
in
public
,
if
he
can
not
induce
her
to
behave
at
home
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
to
be
pitied
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
has
a
desperate
life
of
it
with
the
lot
of
them
.
<EOS>
That
apish
-
looking
man
there
,
with
the
long
beard
and
the
loose
trousers
 
<EOS>
he
is
the
woman
's
brother
.
<EOS>
He
is
nearly
as
bad
as
she
is
.
<EOS>
They
are
both
of
them
infidels
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Infidels
!
"
said
Lady
De
Courcy
,
"
and
their
father
a
prebendary
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
likely
to
be
the
new
dean
,
too
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
poor
dear
Dr.
Trefoil
!
"
said
the
countess
,
who
had
once
in
her
life
spoken
to
that
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
so
distressed
to
hear
it
,
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
And
so
Dr.
Stanhope
is
to
be
the
new
dean
!
<EOS>
He
comes
of
an
excellent
family
,
and
I
wish
him
success
in
spite
of
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
Mrs.
Proudie
,
when
he
is
dean
,
they
'll
be
better
able
to
see
the
error
of
their
ways
.
<EOS>
"
  
To
this
Mrs.
Proudie
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
Her
dislike
of
the
Signora
Neroni
was
too
deep
to
admit
of
<EOS>
her
even
hoping
that
that
lady
should
see
the
error
of
her
ways
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
looked
on
the
signora
as
one
of
the
lost
 
one
of
those
beyond
the
reach
of
Christian
charity
 
and
was
therefore
able
to
enjoy
the
luxury
of
hating
her
without
the
drawback
of
wishing
her
eventually
well
out
of
her
sins
.
  
<EOS>
Any
further
conversation
between
these
congenial
souls
was
prevented
by
the
advent
of
Mr.
Thorne
,
who
came
to
lead
the
countess
to
the
tent
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
had
been
desired
to
do
so
some
ten
minutes
since
,
but
he
had
been
delayed
in
the
drawing
-
room
by
the
signora
.
<EOS>
She
had
contrived
to
detain
him
,
to
get
him
near
to
her
sofa
,
and
at
last
to
make
him
seat
himself
on
a
chair
close
to
her
beautiful
arm
.
<EOS>
The
fish
took
the
bait
,
was
hooked
,
and
caught
,
and
landed
.
<EOS>
Within
that
ten
minutes
he
had
heard
the
whole
of
the
signora
's
history
in
such
strains
as
she
chose
to
use
in
telling
it
.
<EOS>
He
learnt
from
the
lady
's
own
lips
the
whole
of
that
mysterious
tale
to
which
the
Honourable
George
had
merely
alluded
.
<EOS>
He
discovered
that
the
beautiful
creature
lying
before
him
had
been
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
.
<EOS>
She
had
owned
to
him
that
she
had
been
weak
,
confiding
,
and
indifferent
to
the
world
's
opinion
,
and
that
she
had
therefore
been
ill
-
used
,
deceived
,
and
evil
spoken
of
.
<EOS>
She
had
spoken
to
him
of
her
mutilated
limb
,
her
youth
destroyed
in
fullest
bloom
,
her
beauty
robbed
of
its
every
charm
,
her
life
blighted
,
her
hopes
withered
,
and
as
she
did
so
a
tear
dropped
from
her
eye
to
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
him
of
these
things
and
asked
for
his
sympathy
.
  
<EOS>
What
could
a
good
-
natured
,
genial
,
Anglo
-
Saxon
Squire
Thorne
do
but
promise
to
sympathize
with
her
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
did
promise
to
sympathize
;
promised
also
to
come
and
see
the
last
of
the
Neros
,
to
hear
more
of
those
fearful
Roman
days
,
of
those
light
and
innocent
but
dangerous
hours
which
flitted
by
so
fast
on
the
shores
of
Como
,
and
to
make
himself
the
confidant
of
the
signora
's
sorrows
.
  
<EOS>
We
need
hardly
say
that
he
dropped
all
idea
of
warning
his
sister
against
the
dangerous
lady
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
mistaken
 
never
so
much
mistaken
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
had
always
regarded
that
Honourable
George
as
a
coarse
,
brutal
-
minded
young
man
;
now
he
was
more
convinced
than
ever
that
he
was
so
.
<EOS>
It
was
by
such
men
as
the
Honourable
George
that
the
reputations
of
such
women
as
Madeline
Neroni
were
imperilled
and
damaged
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
and
see
the
lady
in
her
own
house
;
he
was
fully
sure
in
his
own
mind
of
the
soundness
of
his
own
judgement
;
if
he
found
her
,
as
he
believed
he
should
do
,
an
injured
,
well
-
disposed
,
warm
-
hearted
woman
,
he
would
get
his
sister
Monica
to
invite
her
out
to
Ullathorne
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
she
,
as
at
her
instance
he
got
up
to
leave
her
and
declared
that
he
himself
would
attend
upon
her
wants
;
"
no
,
no
,
<EOS>
my
friend
;
I
positively
put
a
veto
upon
your
doing
so
.
<EOS>
What
,
in
your
own
house
,
with
an
assemblage
round
you
such
as
there
is
here
!
<EOS>
Do
you
wish
to
make
every
woman
hate
me
and
every
man
stare
at
me
?
<EOS>
I
lay
a
positive
order
on
you
not
to
come
near
me
again
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Come
and
see
me
at
home
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
at
home
that
I
can
talk
,
it
is
only
at
home
that
I
really
can
live
and
enjoy
myself
.
<EOS>
My
days
of
going
out
,
days
such
as
these
,
are
rare
indeed
.
<EOS>
Come
and
see
me
at
home
,
Mr.
Thorne
,
and
then
I
will
not
bid
you
to
leave
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
,
we
believe
,
common
with
young
men
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
to
look
on
their
seniors
 
on
men
of
,
say
,
double
their
own
age
 
as
so
many
stocks
and
stones
 
stocks
and
stones
,
that
is
,
in
regard
to
feminine
beauty
.
<EOS>
There
never
was
a
greater
mistake
.
<EOS>
Women
,
indeed
,
generally
know
better
,
but
on
this
subject
men
of
one
age
are
thoroughly
ignorant
of
what
is
the
very
nature
of
mankind
of
other
ages
.
<EOS>
No
experience
of
what
goes
on
in
the
world
,
no
reading
of
history
,
no
observation
of
life
,
has
any
effect
in
teaching
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Men
of
fifty
do
n't
dance
mazurkas
,
being
generally
too
fat
and
wheezy
;
nor
do
they
sit
for
the
hour
together
on
river
-
banks
at
their
mistresses
'
feet
,
being
somewhat
afraid
of
rheumatism
.
<EOS>
But
for
real
true
love
 
love
at
first
sight
,
love
to
devotion
,
love
that
robs
a
man
of
his
sleep
,
love
that
"
will
gaze
an
eagle
blind
,
"
love
that
"
will
hear
the
lowest
sound
when
the
suspicious
tread
of
theft
is
stopped
,
"
love
that
is
"
like
a
Hercules
,
still
climbing
trees
in
the
Hesperides
<EOS>
"
 
we
believe
the
best
age
is
from
forty
-
five
to
seventy
;
up
to
that
,
men
are
generally
given
to
mere
flirting
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
present
moment
Mr.
Thorne
,
_
ætat
_
.
fifty
,
was
over
head
and
ears
in
love
at
first
sight
with
the
Signora
Madeline
Vesey
Neroni
,
nata
Stanhope
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
was
sufficiently
master
of
himself
to
offer
his
arm
with
all
propriety
to
Lady
De
Courcy
,
and
the
countess
graciously
permitted
herself
to
be
led
to
the
tent
.
<EOS>
Such
had
been
Miss
Thorne
's
orders
,
as
she
had
succeeded
in
inducing
the
bishop
to
lead
old
Lady
Knowle
to
the
top
of
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
baronets
was
sent
off
in
quest
of
Mrs.
Proudie
and
found
that
lady
on
the
lawn
not
in
the
best
of
humours
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
and
the
countess
had
left
her
too
abruptly
;
she
had
in
vain
looked
about
for
an
attendant
chaplain
,
or
even
a
stray
curate
;
they
were
all
drawing
long
bows
with
the
young
ladies
at
the
bottom
of
the
lawn
,
or
finding
places
for
their
graceful
co
-
toxophilites
in
some
snug
corner
of
the
tent
.
<EOS>
In
such
position
Mrs.
Proudie
had
been
wo
nt
in
earlier
days
to
fall
back
upon
Mr.
Slope
,
but
now
she
could
never
fall
back
upon
him
again
.
<EOS>
She
gave
her
head
one
shake
as
she
thought
of
her
lone
position
,
and
that
shake
was
as
good
as
a
week
deducted
from
Mr.
Slope
's
longer
sojourn
in
Barchester
.
<EOS>
Sir
Harkaway
Gorse
,
however
,
relieved
her
present
misery
,
though
his
doing
so
by
no
means
mitigated
the
sinning
chaplain
's
doom
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
the
eating
and
drinking
began
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
,
to
his
great
horror
,
found
himself
leagued
to
Mrs.
Clantantram
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clantantram
had
a
great
regard
for
the
archdeacon
,
which
was
not
cordially
returned
,
and
when
she
,
coming
up
to
him
,
whispered
in
his
ear
,
"
Come
,
Archdeacon
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
you
wo
n't
begrudge
an
old
friend
the
favour
of
your
arm
,
"
and
then
proceeded
to
tell
him
the
whole
history
of
her
roquelaure
,
he
resolved
that
he
would
shake
her
off
before
he
was
fifteen
minutes
older
.
<EOS>
But
latterly
the
archdeacon
had
not
been
successful
in
his
resolutions
,
and
on
the
present
occasion
Mrs.
Clantantram
stuck
to
him
till
the
banquet
was
over
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
got
a
baronet
's
wife
,
and
Mrs.
Grantly
fell
to
the
lot
of
a
baronet
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
Stanhope
attached
herself
to
Mr.
Harding
in
order
to
make
room
for
Bertie
,
who
succeeded
in
sitting
down
in
the
dining
-
room
next
to
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
To
speak
sooth
,
now
that
he
had
love
in
earnest
to
make
,
his
heart
almost
failed
him
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
had
been
right
glad
to
avail
herself
of
his
arm
,
seeing
that
Mr.
Slope
was
hovering
nigh
her
.
<EOS>
In
striving
to
avoid
that
terrible
Charybdis
of
a
Slope
<EOS>
she
was
in
great
danger
of
falling
into
an
unseen
Scylla
on
the
other
hand
,
that
Scylla
being
Bertie
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
gracious
than
she
was
to
Bertie
.
<EOS>
She
almost
jumped
at
his
proffered
arm
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
perceived
this
from
a
distance
and
triumphed
in
her
heart
;
Bertie
felt
it
and
was
encouraged
;
Mr.
Slope
saw
it
and
glowered
with
jealousy
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
and
Bertie
sat
down
to
table
in
the
dining
-
room
,
and
as
she
took
her
seat
at
his
right
hand
she
found
that
Mr.
Slope
was
already
in
possession
of
the
chair
at
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
As
these
things
were
going
on
in
the
dining
-
room
,
Mr.
Arabin
was
hanging
enraptured
and
alone
over
the
signora
's
sofa
,
and
Eleanor
from
her
seat
could
look
through
the
open
door
and
see
that
he
was
doing
so
.
   
<EOS>
The
Bishop
Sits
Down
to
Breakfast
,
and
the
Dean
Dies
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Barchester
said
grace
over
the
well
-
spread
board
in
the
Ullathorne
dining
-
room
;
while
he
did
so
,
the
last
breath
was
flying
from
the
Dean
of
Barchester
as
he
lay
in
his
sick
room
in
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
When
the
Bishop
of
Barchester
raised
his
first
glass
of
champagne
to
his
lips
,
the
deanship
of
Barchester
was
a
good
thing
in
the
gift
of
the
prime
minister
.
<EOS>
Before
the
Bishop
of
Barchester
had
left
the
table
,
the
minister
of
the
day
was
made
aware
of
the
fact
at
his
country
-
seat
in
Hampshire
,
and
had
already
turned
over
in
his
mind
the
names
of
five
very
respectable
aspirants
for
the
preferment
.
<EOS>
It
is
at
present
only
necessary
to
say
that
Mr.
Slope
's
name
was
not
among
the
five
.
  
<EOS>
"
'
twas
merry
in
the
hall
when
the
beards
wagged
all
,
"
and
the
clerical
beards
wagged
merrily
in
the
hall
of
Ullathorne
that
day
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
after
the
last
cork
had
been
drawn
,
the
last
speech
made
,
the
last
nut
cracked
,
that
tidings
reached
and
were
whispered
about
that
the
poor
dean
was
no
more
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
for
the
happiness
of
the
clerical
beards
that
this
little
delay
took
place
,
as
otherwise
decency
would
have
forbidden
them
to
wag
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
one
sad
man
among
them
that
day
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
's
beard
did
not
wag
as
it
should
have
done
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
there
hoping
the
best
,
striving
to
think
the
best
,
about
Eleanor
;
turning
over
in
his
mind
all
the
words
he
remembered
to
have
fallen
from
her
about
Mr.
Slope
,
and
trying
to
gather
from
them
a
conviction
unfavourable
to
his
rival
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
exactly
resolved
to
come
that
day
to
some
decisive
proof
as
to
the
widow
's
intention
,
but
he
had
meant
,
if
possible
,
to
recultivate
his
friendship
with
Eleanor
,
and
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
any
such
recultivation
must
have
ended
in
a
declaration
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
passed
the
previous
night
alone
at
his
new
parsonage
,
and
it
was
the
first
night
that
he
had
so
passed
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
dull
and
sombre
enough
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
had
been
right
in
saying
that
a
priestess
would
be
wanting
at
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
He
had
sat
there
alone
with
his
glass
before
him
,
and
then
with
his
tea
-
pot
,
thinking
about
Eleanor
Bold
.
<EOS>
As
is
usual
in
such
meditations
,
he
did
little
but
blame
her
;
blame
her
for
liking
Mr.
Slope
,
and
blame
her
for
not
liking
him
;
blame
her
for
her
cordiality
to
himself
,
and
blame
her
for
her
want
of
cordiality
;
blame
her
for
being
stubborn
,
headstrong
,
and
passionate
;
and
yet
the
more
he
thought
of
her
the
higher
she
rose
in
his
affection
.
<EOS>
If
only
it
should
turn
out
,
if
only
it
could
be
made
to
turn
out
,
that
she
had
defended
Mr.
Slope
,
not
from
love
,
but
on
principle
,
all
would
be
right
.
<EOS>
Such
principle
in
itself
would
be
admirable
,
lovable
,
womanly
;
he
felt
that
he
could
be
pleased
to
allow
Mr.
Slope
just
so
much
favour
as
that
.
<EOS>
But
if
 
And
then
Mr.
Arabin
poked
his
fire
most
unnecessarily
,
spoke
crossly
to
his
new
parlour
-
maid
who
came
in
for
the
tea
-
things
,
and
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
determined
to
go
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
Why
had
she
been
so
stiff
-
necked
when
asked
a
plain
question
?
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
have
known
in
what
light
he
regarded
her
.
<EOS>
Why
had
she
not
answered
a
plain
question
and
so
put
an
end
to
his
misery
?
<EOS>
Then
,
instead
of
going
to
sleep
in
his
armchair
,
Mr.
Arabin
walked
about
the
room
as
though
he
had
been
possessed
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
,
when
he
attended
Miss
Thorne
's
behests
,
he
was
still
in
a
somewhat
confused
state
.
<EOS>
His
first
duty
had
been
to
converse
with
Mrs.
Clantantram
,
and
that
lady
had
found
it
impossible
to
elicit
the
slightest
sympathy
from
him
on
the
subject
of
her
roquelaure
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
had
asked
him
whether
Mrs.
Bold
was
coming
with
the
Grantlys
,
and
the
two
names
of
Bold
and
Grantly
together
had
nearly
made
him
jump
from
his
seat
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
in
this
state
of
confused
uncertainty
,
hope
,
and
doubt
,
when
he
saw
Mr.
Slope
,
with
his
most
polished
smile
,
handing
Eleanor
out
of
her
carriage
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
He
never
considered
whether
the
carriage
belonged
to
her
or
to
Mr.
Slope
,
or
to
anyone
else
to
whom
they
might
both
be
mutually
obliged
without
any
concert
between
themselves
.
<EOS>
This
sight
in
his
present
state
of
mind
was
quite
enough
to
upset
him
and
his
resolves
.
<EOS>
It
was
clear
as
noon
-
day
.
<EOS>
Had
he
seen
her
handed
into
a
carriage
by
Mr.
Slope
at
a
church
door
with
a
white
veil
over
her
head
,
the
truth
could
not
be
more
manifest
.
<EOS>
He
went
into
the
house
and
,
as
we
have
seen
,
soon
found
himself
walking
with
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
Eleanor
came
up
,
and
then
he
had
to
leave
his
companion
and
either
go
about
alone
or
find
another
.
<EOS>
While
in
this
state
he
was
encountered
by
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
,
"
said
Dr.
Grantly
,
"
if
it
be
true
that
Mr.
Slope
and
Mrs.
Bold
came
here
together
.
<EOS>
Susan
says
she
is
almost
sure
she
saw
their
faces
in
the
same
carriage
as
she
got
out
of
her
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
bear
his
testimony
to
the
correctness
of
Mrs.
Grantly
's
eyesight
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
perfectly
shameful
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
;
"
or
,
I
should
rather
say
,
shameless
.
<EOS>
She
was
asked
here
as
my
guest
,
and
if
she
be
determined
to
disgrace
herself
,
she
should
have
feeling
enough
not
to
do
so
before
my
immediate
friends
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
that
man
got
himself
invited
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
she
had
the
face
to
bring
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
To
this
Mr.
Arabin
could
answer
nothing
,
nor
did
he
wish
to
answer
anything
.
<EOS>
Though
he
abused
Eleanor
to
himself
,
he
did
not
choose
to
abuse
her
to
anyone
else
,
nor
was
he
well
-
pleased
to
hear
anyone
else
speak
ill
of
her
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
,
however
,
was
very
angry
and
did
not
spare
his
sister
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
therefore
left
him
as
soon
as
he
could
and
wandered
back
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
there
long
when
the
signora
was
brought
in
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
he
kept
himself
out
of
temptation
,
and
merely
hovered
round
her
at
a
distance
;
but
as
soon
as
Mr.
Thorne
had
left
her
,
he
yielded
himself
up
to
the
basilisk
and
allowed
himself
to
be
made
prey
of
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
say
how
the
knowledge
had
been
acquired
,
but
the
signora
had
a
sort
of
instinctive
knowledge
that
Mr.
Arabin
was
an
admirer
of
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
Men
hunt
foxes
by
the
aid
of
dogs
,
and
are
aware
that
they
do
so
by
the
strong
organ
of
smell
with
which
the
dog
is
endowed
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
,
however
,
in
the
least
comprehend
how
such
a
sense
can
work
with
such
acuteness
.
<EOS>
The
organ
by
which
women
instinctively
,
as
it
were
,
know
and
feel
how
other
women
are
regarded
by
men
,
and
how
also
men
are
regarded
by
other
women
,
is
equally
strong
,
and
equally
incomprehensible
.
<EOS>
A
glance
,
a
word
,
a
motion
,
suffices
:
by
some
such
acute
exercise
of
her
feminine
senses
the
signora
was
aware
that
Mr.
Arabin
loved
Eleanor
Bold
;
therefore
,
by
a
further
exercise
of
her
peculiar
feminine
propensities
,
it
was
quite
natural
for
her
to
entrap
Mr.
Arabin
into
her
net
.
  
<EOS>
The
work
was
half
-
done
before
she
came
to
Ullathorne
,
and
when
could
she
have
a
better
opportunity
of
completing
it
?
<EOS>
She
had
had
almost
enough
of
Mr.
Slope
,
though
she
could
not
quite
resist
the
fun
of
driving
a
very
sanctimonious
clergyman
to
madness
by
a
desperate
and
ruinous
passion
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
had
fallen
too
easily
to
give
much
pleasure
in
the
chase
.
<EOS>
His
position
as
a
man
of
wealth
might
make
his
alliance
of
value
,
but
as
a
lover
he
was
very
second
-
rate
.
<EOS>
We
may
say
that
she
regarded
him
somewhat
as
a
sportsman
does
a
pheasant
.
<EOS>
The
bird
is
so
easily
shot
that
he
would
not
be
worth
the
shooting
were
it
not
for
the
very
respectable
appearance
that
he
makes
in
a
larder
.
<EOS>
The
signora
would
not
waste
much
time
in
shooting
Mr.
Thorne
,
but
still
he
was
worth
bagging
for
family
uses
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Arabin
was
game
of
another
sort
.
<EOS>
The
signora
was
herself
possessed
of
quite
sufficient
intelligence
to
know
that
Mr.
Arabin
was
a
man
more
than
usually
intellectual
.
<EOS>
She
knew
also
that
,
as
a
clergyman
,
he
was
of
a
much
higher
stamp
than
Mr.
Slope
and
that
,
as
a
gentleman
,
he
was
better
educated
than
Mr.
Thorne
.
<EOS>
She
would
never
have
attempted
to
drive
Mr.
Arabin
into
ridiculous
misery
as
she
did
Mr.
Slope
,
nor
would
she
think
it
possible
to
dispose
of
him
in
ten
minutes
as
she
had
done
with
Mr.
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
Such
were
her
reflexions
about
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
As
to
Mr.
Arabin
,
it
can
not
be
said
that
he
reflected
at
all
about
the
signora
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
she
was
beautiful
,
and
he
felt
that
she
was
able
to
charm
him
.
<EOS>
He
required
charming
in
his
present
misery
,
and
therefore
he
went
and
stood
at
the
head
of
her
couch
.
<EOS>
She
knew
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
Such
were
her
peculiar
gifts
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
nature
to
see
that
he
required
charming
,
and
it
was
her
province
to
charm
him
.
<EOS>
As
the
Eastern
idler
swallows
his
dose
of
opium
,
as
the
London
reprobate
swallows
his
dose
of
gin
,
so
with
similar
desires
and
for
similar
reasons
did
Mr.
Arabin
prepare
to
swallow
the
charms
of
the
Signora
Neroni
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
an't
you
shooting
with
bows
and
arrows
,
Mr.
Arabin
?
<EOS>
"
said
she
,
when
they
were
nearly
alone
together
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
"
or
talking
with
young
ladies
in
shady
bowers
,
or
turning
your
talents
to
account
in
some
way
?
<EOS>
What
was
a
bachelor
like
you
asked
here
for
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
mean
to
earn
your
cold
chicken
and
champagne
?
<EOS>
Were
I
you
,
<EOS>
I
should
be
ashamed
to
be
so
idle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
murmured
some
sort
of
answer
.
<EOS>
Though
he
wished
to
be
charmed
,
he
was
hardly
yet
in
a
mood
to
be
playful
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
what
ails
you
,
Mr.
Arabin
?
"
said

<EOS>
Here
you
are
in
your
own
parish
 
Miss
Thorne
tells
me
that
her
party
is
given
expressly
in
your
honour
 
and
yet
you
are
the
only
dull
man
at
it
.
<EOS>
Your
friend
Mr.
Slope
was
with
me
a
few
minutes
since
,
full
of
life
and
spirits
;
why
do
n't
you
rival
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
difficult
for
so
acute
an
observer
as
Madeline
Neroni
to
see
that
she
had
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
and
driven
the
bolt
home
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
winced
visibly
before
her
attack
,
and
she
knew
at
once
that
he
was
jealous
of
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
look
on
you
and
Mr.
Slope
as
the
very
antipodes
of
men
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
in
which
you
are
not
each
the
reverse
of
the
other
,
except
in
belonging
to
the
same
profession
 
and
even
in
that
you
are
so
unlike
as
perfectly
to
maintain
the
rule
.
<EOS>
He
is
gregarious
;
you
are
given
to
solitude
.
<EOS>
He
is
active
;
you
are
passive
.
<EOS>
He
works
;
you
think
.
<EOS>
He
likes
women
;
you
despise
them
.
<EOS>
He
is
fond
of
position
and
power
;
and
so
are
you
,
but
for
directly
different
reasons
.
<EOS>
He
loves
to
be
praised
;
you
very
foolishly
abhor
it
.
<EOS>
He
will
gain
his
rewards
,
which
will
be
an
insipid
,
useful
wife
,
a
comfortable
income
,
and
a
reputation
for
sanctimony
;
you
will
also
gain
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
and
what
will
they
be
?
"
said
Mr.
Arabin
,
who
knew
that
he
was
being
flattered
and
yet
suffered
himself
to
put
up
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
What
will
be
my
rewards
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
heart
of
some
woman
whom
you
will
be
too
austere
to
own
that
you
love
,
and
the
respect
of
some
few
friends
which
you
will
be
too
proud
to
own
that
you
value
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Rich
rewards
,
"
said
he
;
"
but
of
little
worth
,
if
they
are
to
be
so
treated
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
are
not
to
look
for
such
success
as
awaits
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
He
is
born
to
be
a
successful
man
.
<EOS>
He
suggests
to
himself
an
object
and
then
starts
for
it
with
eager
intention
.
<EOS>
Nothing
will
deter
him
from
his
pursuit
.
<EOS>
He
will
have
no
scruples
,
no
fears
,
no
hesitation
.
<EOS>
His
desire
is
to
be
a
bishop
with
a
rising
family
 
<EOS>
the
wife
will
come
first
,
and
in
due
time
the
apron
.
<EOS>
You
will
see
all
this
,
and
then
 
"
  
"
Well
,
and
what
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
will
begin
to
wish
that
you
had
done
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
looked
placidly
out
at
the
lawn
and
,
resting
his
shoulder
on
the
head
of
the
sofa
,
rubbed
his
chin
with
his
hand
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
trick
he
had
when
he
was
thinking
deeply
,
and
what
the
signora
said
made
him
think
.
<EOS>
Was
it
not
all
true
?
<EOS>
Would
he
not
hereafter
look
back
,
if
not
at
Mr.
Slope
,
at
some
others
,
perhaps
not
equally
gifted
with
himself
,
who
had
risen
in
the
world
while
he
had
lagged
behind
,
and
then
wish
that
he
had
done
the
same
?
  
<EOS>
"
Is
not
such
the
doom
of
all
speculative
men
of
talent
?
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
they
not
all
sit
wrapt
as
you
now
are
,
cutting
imaginary
silken
cords
with
their
fine
edges
,
while
those
not
so
highly
tempered
sever
the
everyday
Gordian
knots
of
the
world
's
struggle
and
win
wealth
and
renown
?
<EOS>
Steel
too
highly
polished
,
edges
too
sharp
,
do
not
do
for
this
world
's
work
,
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Who
was
this
woman
that
thus
read
the
secrets
of
his
heart
and
re
-
uttered
to
him
the
unwelcome
bodings
of
his
own
soul
?
<EOS>
He
looked
full
into
her
face
when
she
had
done
speaking
and
said
,
"
Am
I
one
of
those
foolish
blades
,
too
sharp
and
too
fine
to
do
a
useful
day
's
work
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
let
the
Slopes
of
the
world
outdistance
you
?
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
Is
not
the
blood
in
your
veins
as
warm
as
his
?
<EOS>
Does
not
your
pulse
beat
as
fast
?
<EOS>
Has
not
God
made
you
a
man
and
intended
you
to
do
a
man
's
work
here
,
ay
,
and
to
take
a
man
's
wages
also
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
sat
ruminating
,
rubbing
his
face
,
and
wondering
why
these
things
were
said
to
him
,
but
he
replied
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
signora
went
on
:
  
"
<EOS>
The
greatest
mistake
any
man
ever
made
is
to
suppose
that
the
good
things
of
the
world
are
not
worth
the
winning
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
a
mistake
so
opposed
to
the
religion
which
you
preach
!
<EOS>
Why
does
God
permit
his
bishops
one
after
another
to
have
their
five
thousands
and
ten
thousands
a
year
if
such
wealth
be
bad
and
not
worth
having
?
<EOS>
Why
are
beautiful
things
given
to
us
,
and
luxuries
and
pleasant
enjoyments
,
if
they
be
not
intended
to
be
used
?
<EOS>
They
must
be
meant
for
someone
,
and
what
is
good
for
a
layman
surely
can
not
be
bad
for
a
clerk
.
<EOS>
You
try
to
despise
these
good
things
,
but
you
only
try
 
you
do
n't
succeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
I
?
"
said
Mr.
Arabin
,
still
musing
,
not
knowing
what
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
the
question
:
do
you
succeed
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
looked
at
her
piteously
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
as
though
he
were
being
interrogated
by
some
inner
spirit
of
his
own
,
to
whom
he
could
not
refuse
an
answer
,
and
to
whom
he
did
not
dare
to
give
a
false
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
confess
;
do
you
succeed
?
<EOS>
Is
money
so
contemptible
?
<EOS>
Is
worldly
power
so
worthless
?
<EOS>
Is
feminine
beauty
a
trifle
to
be
so
slightly
regarded
by
a
wise
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Feminine
beauty
!
"
said
he
,
gazing
into
her
face
,
as
though
all
the
feminine
beauty
in
the
world
were
concentrated
there
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
say
I
do
not
regard
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
look
at
me
like
that
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
I
shall
alter
my
opinion
 
or
should
do
so
,
were
I
not
of
course
<EOS>
aware
that
I
have
no
beauty
of
my
own
worth
regarding
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
gentleman
blushed
crimson
,
but
the
lady
did
not
blush
at
all
.
<EOS>
A
slightly
increased
colour
animated
her
face
,
just
so
much
so
as
to
give
her
an
air
of
special
interest
.
<EOS>
She
expected
a
compliment
from
her
admirer
,
but
she
was
rather
gratified
than
otherwise
by
finding
that
he
did
not
pay
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
Messrs.
Slope
and
Thorne
,
Messrs.
Brown
,
Jones
,
and
Robinson
,
they
all
paid
her
compliments
.
<EOS>
She
was
rather
in
hopes
that
she
would
ultimately
succeed
in
inducing
Mr.
Arabin
to
abuse
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
your
gaze
,
"
said
she
,
"
is
one
of
wonder
,
not
of
admiration
.
<EOS>
You
wonder
at
my
audacity
in
asking
you
such
questions
about
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
do
rather
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nevertheless
,
I
expect
an
answer
,
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
Why
were
women
made
beautiful
if
men
are
not
to
regard
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
men
do
regard
them
,
"
he
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
not
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
begging
the
question
,
Madame
Neroni
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
shall
beg
nothing
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
which
you
will
not
grant
,
and
I
do
beg
for
an
answer
.
<EOS>
Do
you
not
as
a
rule
think
women
below
your
notice
as
companions
?
<EOS>
Let
us
see
.
<EOS>
There
is
the
Widow
Bold
looking
round
at
you
from
her
chair
this
minute
.
<EOS>
What
would
you
say
to
her
as
a
companion
for
life
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
rising
from
his
position
,
leaned
over
the
sofa
and
looked
through
the
drawing
-
room
door
to
the
place
where
Eleanor
was
seated
between
Bertie
Stanhope
and
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
She
at
once
caught
his
glance
and
averted
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
pleasantly
placed
in
her
present
position
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
was
doing
his
best
to
attract
her
attention
,
and
she
was
striving
to
prevent
his
doing
so
by
talking
to
Mr.
Stanhope
,
while
her
mind
was
intently
fixed
on
Mr.
Arabin
and
Madame
Neroni
.
<EOS>
Bertie
Stanhope
endeavoured
to
take
advantage
of
her
favours
,
but
he
was
thinking
more
of
the
manner
in
which
he
would
by
and
by
throw
himself
at
her
feet
than
of
amusing
her
at
the
present
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
said
the
signora
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
stretching
her
beautiful
neck
to
look
at
you
,
and
now
you
have
disturbed
her
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
declare
I
believe
I
am
wrong
about
you
;
I
believe
that
you
do
think
Mrs.
Bold
a
charming
woman
.
<EOS>
Your
looks
seem
to
say
so
,
and
by
her
looks
I
should
say
that
she
is
jealous
of
me
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
confide
in
me
,
and
if
it
is
so
,
I
'll
do
all
in
my
power
to
make
up
the
match
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
needless
to
say
that
the
signora
was
not
very
sincere
in
her
offer
.
<EOS>
She
was
never
sincere
on
such
subjects
.
<EOS>
She
never
expected
others
to
be
so
,
nor
did
she
expect
others
to
think
her
<EOS>
so
.
<EOS>
Such
matters
were
her
playthings
,
her
billiard
table
,
her
hounds
and
hunters
,
her
waltzes
and
polkas
,
her
picnics
and
summer
-
day
excursions
.
<EOS>
She
had
little
else
to
amuse
her
,
and
therefore
played
at
love
-
making
in
all
its
forms
.
<EOS>
She
was
now
playing
at
it
with
Mr.
Arabin
,
and
did
not
at
all
expect
the
earnestness
and
truth
of
his
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
in
your
power
would
be
nothing
,
"
said
he
,
"
for
Mrs.
Bold
is
,
I
imagine
,
already
engaged
to
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
own
the
impeachment
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
cross
-
question
me
rather
unfairly
,
"
he
replied
,
"
and
I
do
not
know
why
I
answer
you
at
all
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
is
a
very
beautiful
woman
,
and
as
intelligent
as
beautiful
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
know
her
without
admiring
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
think
the
widow
a
very
beautiful
woman
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
one
that
would
grace
the
parsonage
of
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
that
would
well
grace
any
man
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
really
have
the
effrontery
to
tell
me
this
,
"
said
she
;
"
to
tell
me
,
who
,
as
you
very
well
know
,
set
up
to
be
a
beauty
myself
,
and
who
am
at
this
very
moment
taking
such
an
interest
in
your
affairs
,
you
really
have
the
effrontery
to
tell
me
that
Mrs.
Bold
is
the
most
beautiful
woman
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
say
so
,
"
said
Mr.
Arabin
;
"
you
are
more
beautiful
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
,
come
now
,
that
is
something
like
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
could
not
be
so
unfeeling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
more
beautiful
,
perhaps
more
clever
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
thank
you
,
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
you
and
I
should
be
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
 
"
  
"
Not
a
word
further
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
hear
a
word
further
.
<EOS>
If
you
talk
till
midnight
you
can
not
improve
what
you
have
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
Madame
Neroni
,
Mrs.
Bold
 
"
  
"
I
will
not
hear
a
word
about
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
Dread
thoughts
of
strychnine
did
pass
across
my
brain
,
but
she
is
welcome
to
the
second
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Her
place
 
"
  
"
I
wo
n't
hear
anything
about
her
or
her
place
.
<EOS>
I
am
satisfied
,
and
that
is
enough
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Arabin
,
I
am
dying
with
hunger
;
beautiful
and
clever
as
I
am
,
you
know
I
can
not
go
to
my
food
,
and
yet
you
do
not
bring
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
at
any
rate
was
so
true
as
to
make
it
necessary
that
Mr.
Arabin
should
act
upon
it
,
and
he
accordingly
went
into
the
dining
-
room
and
supplied
the
signora
's
wants
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
yourself
?
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
am
not
hungry
.
<EOS>
I
never
eat
at
this
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
do
n't
let
love
interfere
with
your
appetite
.
<EOS>
It
never
does
with
mine
.
<EOS>
Give
me
half
a
glass
more
champagne
and
then
go
to
the
table
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
will
do
me
an
injury
if
you
stay
talking
to
me
any
longer
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
did
as
he
was
bid
.
<EOS>
He
took
her
plate
and
glass
from
her
and
,
going
into
the
dining
-
room
,
helped
himself
to
a
sandwich
from
the
crowded
table
and
began
munching
it
in
a
corner
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
was
doing
so
Miss
Thorne
,
who
had
hardly
sat
down
for
a
moment
,
came
into
the
room
and
,
seeing
him
standing
,
was
greatly
distressed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
Mr.
Arabin
,
"
said
she
,
"
have
you
never
sat
down
yet
?
<EOS>
I
am
so
distressed
.
<EOS>
You
of
all
men
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
assured
her
that
he
had
only
just
come
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
very
reason
why
you
should
lose
no
more
time
.
<EOS>
Come
,
I
'll
make
room
for
you
.
<EOS>
Thank'ee
,
my
dear
,
"
she
said
,
seeing
that
Mrs.
Bold
was
making
an
attempt
to
move
from
her
chair
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
would
not
for
worlds
see
you
stir
,
for
<EOS>
all
the
ladies
would
think
it
necessary
to
follow
.
<EOS>
But
,
perhaps
,
if
Mr.
Stanhope
has
done
 
just
for
a
minute
,
Mr.
Stanhope
,
till
I
can
get
another
chair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
Bertie
had
to
rise
to
make
way
for
his
rival
.
<EOS>
This
he
did
,
as
he
did
everything
,
with
an
air
of
good
-
humoured
pleasantry
which
made
it
impossible
for
Mr.
Arabin
to
refuse
the
proffered
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
bishopric
let
another
take
,
"
said
Bertie
,
the
quotation
being
certainly
not
very
appropriate
either
for
the
occasion
or
the
person
spoken
to
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
eaten
and
am
satisfied
;
Mr.
Arabin
,
pray
take
my
chair
.
<EOS>
I
wish
for
your
sake
that
it
really
was
a
bishop
's
seat
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
did
sit
down
,
and
as
he
did
so
Mrs.
Bold
got
up
as
though
to
follow
her
neighbour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
pray
do
n't
move
,
"
said
Miss
Thorne
,
almost
forcing
Eleanor
back
into
her
chair
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Stanhope
is
not
going
to
leave
us
.
<EOS>
He
will
stand
behind
you
like
a
true
knight
as
he
is
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
think
of
it
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
let
me
introduce
you
to
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
Mr.
Arabin
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
two
gentlemen
bowed
stiffly
to
each
other
across
the
lady
whom
they
both
intended
to
marry
,
while
the
other
gentleman
who
also
intended
to
marry
her
stood
behind
,
watching
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
had
never
met
each
other
before
,
and
the
present
was
certainly
not
a
good
opportunity
for
much
cordial
conversation
,
even
if
cordial
conversation
between
them
had
been
possible
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
the
whole
four
who
formed
the
party
seemed
as
though
their
tongues
were
tied
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
who
was
wide
awake
to
what
he
hoped
was
his
coming
opportunity
,
was
not
much
concerned
in
the
interest
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
His
wish
was
to
see
Eleanor
move
,
that
he
might
pursue
her
.
<EOS>
Bertie
was
not
exactly
in
the
same
frame
of
mind
;
the
evil
day
was
near
enough
;
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
precipitate
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
Eleanor
Bold
if
he
could
,
and
was
resolved
to
-
day
to
take
the
first
preliminary
step
towards
doing
so
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
time
enough
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
going
to
make
an
offer
of
marriage
over
the
table
-
cloth
.
<EOS>
Having
thus
good
-
naturedly
made
way
for
Mr.
Arabin
,
he
was
willing
also
to
let
him
talk
to
the
future
Mrs.
Stanhope
as
long
as
they
remained
in
their
present
position
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
having
bowed
to
Mr.
Slope
,
began
eating
his
food
without
saying
a
word
further
.
<EOS>
He
was
full
of
thought
,
and
though
he
ate
he
did
so
unconsciously
.
  
<EOS>
But
poor
Eleanor
was
the
most
to
be
pitied
.
<EOS>
The
only
friend
on
whom
she
thought
she
could
rely
was
Bertie
Stanhope
,
and
he
,
it
seemed
,
was
determined
to
desert
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
did
not
attempt
to
address
her
.
<EOS>
She
said
a
few
words
in
reply
to
some
remarks
from
Mr.
Slope
and
then
,
feeling
the
situation
too
much
for
her
,
started
from
her
chair
in
spite
of
Miss
Thorne
and
hurried
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
followed
her
,
and
young
Stanhope
lost
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Madeline
Neroni
,
when
she
was
left
alone
,
could
not
help
pondering
much
on
the
singular
interview
she
had
had
with
this
singular
man
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
that
she
had
spoken
to
him
had
been
intended
by
her
to
be
received
as
true
,
and
yet
he
had
answered
her
in
the
very
spirit
of
truth
.
<EOS>
He
had
done
so
,
and
she
had
been
aware
that
he
had
so
done
.
<EOS>
She
had
wormed
from
him
his
secret
,
and
he
,
debarred
as
it
would
seem
from
man
's
usual
privilege
of
lying
,
had
innocently
laid
bare
his
whole
soul
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
loved
Eleanor
Bold
,
but
Eleanor
was
not
in
his
eye
so
beautiful
as
herself
.
<EOS>
He
would
fain
have
Eleanor
for
his
wife
,
but
yet
he
had
acknowledged
that
she
was
the
less
gifted
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
The
man
had
literally
been
unable
to
falsify
his
thoughts
when
questioned
,
and
had
been
compelled
to
be
true
_
malgré
lui
_
,
even
when
truth
must
have
been
so
disagreeable
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
This
teacher
of
men
,
this
Oxford
pundit
,
this
double
-
distilled
quintessence
of
university
perfection
,
this
writer
of
religious
treatises
,
this
speaker
of
ecclesiastical
speeches
,
had
been
like
a
little
child
in
her
hands
;
she
had
turned
him
inside
out
and
read
his
very
heart
as
she
might
have
done
that
of
a
young
girl
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
despise
him
for
his
facile
openness
,
and
yet
she
liked
him
for
it
,
too
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
novelty
to
her
,
a
new
trait
in
a
man
's
character
.
<EOS>
She
felt
also
that
she
could
never
so
completely
make
a
fool
of
him
as
she
did
of
the
Slopes
and
Thornes
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
she
never
could
induce
Mr.
Arabin
to
make
protestations
to
her
that
were
not
true
,
or
to
listen
to
nonsense
<EOS>
that
was
mere
nonsense
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
quite
clear
that
Mr.
Arabin
was
heartily
in
love
with
Mrs.
Bold
;
and
the
signora
,
with
very
unwonted
good
nature
,
began
to
turn
it
over
in
her
mind
whether
she
could
not
do
him
a
good
turn
.
<EOS>
Of
course
Bertie
was
to
have
the
first
chance
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
understood
family
arrangement
that
her
brother
was
,
if
possible
,
to
marry
the
Widow
Bold
.
<EOS>
Madeline
knew
too
well
his
necessities
and
what
was
due
to
her
sister
to
interfere
with
so
excellent
a
plan
,
as
long
as
it
might
be
feasible
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
strong
suspicion
that
it
was
not
feasible
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
think
it
likely
that
Mrs.
Bold
would
accept
a
man
in
her
brother
's
position
,
and
she
had
frequently
said
so
to
Charlotte
.
<EOS>
She
was
inclined
to
believe
that
Mr.
Slope
had
more
chance
of
success
,
and
with
her
it
would
be
a
labour
of
love
to
rob
Mr.
Slope
of
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
the
signora
resolved
,
should
Bertie
fail
,
to
do
a
good
-
natured
act
for
once
in
her
life
and
give
up
Mr.
Arabin
to
the
woman
whom
he
loved
.
   
<EOS>
The
Lookalofts
and
the
Greenacres
 
<EOS>
On
the
whole
,
Miss
Thorne
's
provision
for
the
amusement
and
feeding
of
the
outer
classes
in
the
exoteric
paddock
was
not
unsuccessful
.
  
<EOS>
Two
little
drawbacks
to
the
general
happiness
did
take
place
,
but
they
were
of
a
temporary
nature
,
and
apparent
rather
than
real
.
<EOS>
The
first
was
the
downfall
of
young
Harry
Greenacre
,
and
the
other
the
uprise
of
Mrs.
Lookaloft
and
her
family
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
quintain
,
it
became
more
popular
among
the
boys
on
foot
than
it
would
ever
have
been
among
the
men
on
horseback
,
even
had
young
Greenacre
been
more
successful
.
<EOS>
It
was
twirled
round
and
round
till
it
was
nearly
twirled
out
of
the
ground
,
and
the
bag
of
flour
was
used
with
great
gusto
in
powdering
the
backs
and
heads
of
all
who
could
be
coaxed
within
its
vicinity
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
it
was
reported
all
through
the
assemblage
that
Harry
was
dead
,
and
there
was
a
pathetic
scene
between
him
and
his
mother
when
it
was
found
that
he
had
escaped
scatheless
from
the
fall
.
<EOS>
A
good
deal
of
beer
was
drunk
on
the
occasion
,
and
the
quintain
was
"
dratted
"
and
"
bothered
,
"
and
very
generally
anathematized
by
all
the
mothers
who
had
young
sons
likely
to
be
placed
in
similar
jeopardy
.
<EOS>
But
the
affair
of
Mrs.
Lookaloft
was
of
a
more
serious
nature
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
tell
"
ee
plainly
 
face
to
face
 
<EOS>
she
be
there
in
madam
's
drawing
-
room
;
herself
and
Gussy
,
and
them
two
walloping
gals
,
dressed
up
to
their
very
eyeses
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
said
by
a
very
positive
,
very
indignant
,
and
very
fat
farmer
's
wife
,
who
was
sitting
on
the
end
of
a
bench
leaning
on
the
handle
of
a
huge
,
cotton
umbrella
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
:
you
did
n't
zee
her
,
Dame
Guffern
?
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs.
Greenacre
,
whom
this
information
,
joined
to
the
recent
peril
undergone
by
her
son
,
almost
overpowered
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Greenacre
held
just
as
much
land
as
Mr.
Lookaloft
,
paid
his
rent
quite
as
punctually
,
and
his
opinion
in
the
vestry
room
was
reckoned
to
be
every
whit
as
good
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lookaloft
's
rise
in
the
world
had
been
wormwood
to
Mrs.
Greenacre
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
taste
herself
for
the
sort
of
finery
which
had
converted
Barleystubb
farm
into
Rosebank
and
which
had
occasionally
graced
Mr.
Lookaloft
's
letters
with
the
dignity
of
esquirehood
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
wish
to
convert
her
own
homestead
into
Violet
Villa
,
or
to
see
her
goodman
go
about
with
a
new
-
fangled
handle
to
his
name
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
a
mortal
injury
to
her
that
Mrs.
Lookaloft
should
be
successful
in
her
hunt
after
such
honours
.
<EOS>
She
had
abused
and
ridiculed
Mrs.
Lookaloft
to
the
extent
of
her
little
power
.
<EOS>
She
had
pushed
against
her
going
out
of
church
,
and
had
excused
herself
with
all
the
easiness
of
equality
.
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
dame
,
I
axes
pardon
,
but
you
be
grown
so
mortal
stout
these
times
.
<EOS>
"
She
had
inquired
with
apparent
cordiality
of
Mr.
Lookaloft
after
"
the
woman
that
owned
him
,
"
and
had
,
as
she
thought
,
been
on
the
whole
able
to
hold
her
own
pretty
well
against
her
aspiring
neighbour
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
she
found
herself
distinctly
put
into
a
separate
and
inferior
class
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lookaloft
was
asked
into
the
Ullathorne
drawing
-
room
merely
because
she
called
her
house
Rosebank
and
had
talked
over
her
husband
into
buying
pianos
and
silk
dresses
instead
of
putting
his
money
by
to
stock
farms
for
his
sons
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenacre
,
much
as
she
reverenced
Miss
Thorne
,
and
highly
as
she
respected
her
husband
's
landlord
,
could
not
but
look
on
this
as
an
act
of
injustice
done
to
her
and
hers
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
the
Lookalofts
had
never
been
recognized
as
being
of
a
different
class
from
the
Greenacres
.
<EOS>
Their
pretensions
were
all
self
-
pretensions
,
their
finery
was
all
paid
for
by
themselves
and
not
granted
to
them
by
others
.
<EOS>
The
local
sovereigns
of
the
vicinity
,
the
district
fountains
of
honour
,
had
hitherto
conferred
on
them
the
stamp
of
no
rank
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
their
crinoline
petticoats
,
late
hours
,
and
mincing
gait
had
been
a
fair
subject
of
Mrs.
Greenacre
's
raillery
,
and
this
raillery
had
been
a
safety
-
valve
for
her
envy
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
and
from
henceforward
,
the
case
would
be
very
different
.
<EOS>
Now
the
Lookalofts
would
boast
that
their
aspirations
had
been
sanctioned
by
the
gentry
of
the
country
;
now
they
would
declare
with
some
show
of
truth
that
their
claims
to
peculiar
consideration
had
been
recognized
.
<EOS>
They
had
sat
as
equal
guests
in
the
presence
of
bishops
and
baronets
;
they
had
been
curtseyed
to
by
Miss
Thorne
on
her
own
drawing
-
room
carpet
;
they
were
about
to
sit
down
to
table
in
company
with
a
live
countess
!
<EOS>
Bab
Lookaloft
,
as
she
had
always
been
called
by
the
young
Greenacres
in
the
days
of
their
juvenile
equality
,
might
possibly
sit
next
to
the
Honourable
George
,
and
that
wretched
Gussy
might
be
permitted
to
hand
a
custard
to
the
Lady
Margaretta
De
Courcy
.
  
<EOS>
The
fruition
of
those
honours
,
or
such
of
them
as
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
envied
family
,
was
not
such
as
should
have
caused
much
envy
.
<EOS>
The
attention
paid
to
the
Lookalofts
by
the
De
Courcys
was
very
limited
,
and
the
amount
of
entertainment
which
they
received
from
the
bishop
's
society
was
hardly
in
itself
a
recompense
for
the
dull
monotony
of
their
day
.
<EOS>
But
of
what
they
endured
Mrs.
Greenacre
took
no
account
;
she
thought
only
of
what
she
considered
they
must
enjoy
,
and
of
the
dreadfully
exalted
tone
of
living
which
would
be
manifested
by
the
Rosebank
family
,
as
the
consequence
of
their
present
distinction
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
did
"
ee
zee
"
em
there
,
dame
,
did
"
ee
zee
"
<EOS>
em
there
with
your
own
eyes
?
<EOS>
"
asked
poor
Mrs.
Greenacre
,
still
hoping
that
there
might
be
some
ground
for
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
could
I
do
that
,
unless
so
be
I
was
there
myself
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Guffern
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
zet
eyes
on
none
of
them
this
blessed
morning
,
but
I
zee'd
them
as
did
.
<EOS>
You
know
our
John
;
well
,
he
will
be
for
keeping
company
with
Betsey
Rusk
,
madam
's
own
maid
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
And
Betsey
is
n't
none
of
your
common
kitchen
wenches
.
<EOS>
So
Betsey
,
she
come
out
to
our
John
,
you
know
,
and
she
's
always
vastly
polite
to
me
,
is
Betsey
Rusk
,
I
must
say
.
<EOS>
So
before
she
took
so
much
as
one
turn
with
John
she
told
me
every
ha'porth
that
was
going
on
up
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Did
she
now
?
"
said
Mrs.
Greenacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
she
did
,
"
said
Mrs.
Guffern
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
she
told
you
them
people
was
up
there
in
the
drawing
-
room
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
told
me
she
zee'd
"
<EOS>
em
come
in
 
that
they
was
dressed
finer
by
half
nor
any
of
the
family
,
with
all
their
neckses
and
buzoms
stark
naked
as
a
born
babby
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
minxes
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Greenacre
,
who
felt
herself
more
put
about
by
this
than
any
other
mark
of
aristocratic
distinction
which
her
enemies
had
assumed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Guffern
,
"
as
naked
as
you
please
,
while
all
the
quality
was
dressed
just
as
you
and
I
be
,
Mrs.
Greenacre
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Drat
their
impudence
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenacre
,
from
whose
well
-
covered
bosom
all
milk
of
human
kindness
was
receding
,
as
far
as
the
family
of
the
Lookalofts
were
concerned
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
says
I
,
"
said
Mrs.
Guffern
;
"
and
so
says
my
goodman
,
Thomas
Guffern
,
when
he
hear'd
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Molly
,
"
says
he
to
me
,
"
if
ever
you
takes
to
going
about
o
'
mornings
with
yourself
all
naked
in
them
ways
<EOS>
,
I
begs
you
wo
n't
come
back
no
more
to
the
old
house
.
"
<EOS>
So
says
I
,
"
Thomas
,
no
more
I
wull
.
"
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
says
he
,
"
drat
it
,
<EOS>
how
the
deuce
does
she
manage
with
her
rheumatiz
,
and
she
not
a
rag
on
her
;
"
"
and
Mrs.
Guffern
laughed
loudly
as
she
thought
of
Mrs.
Lookaloft
's
probable
sufferings
from
rheumatic
attacks
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
to
liken
herself
that
way
to
folk
that
ha
"
blood
in
their
veins
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
that
warn't
<EOS>
all
neither
that
Betsey
told
.
<EOS>
There
they
all
swelled
into
madam
's
drawing
-
room
,
like
so
many
turkey
cocks
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
and
who
dare
say
no
to
us
?
"
<EOS>
and
Gregory
was
thinking
of
telling
of
"
em
to
come
down
here
,
only
his
heart
failed
him
"
cause
of
the
grand
way
they
was
dressed
.
<EOS>
So
in
they
went
,
but
madam
looked
at
them
as
glum
as
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
now
,
"
said
Mrs.
Greenacre
,
greatly
relieved
,
"
<EOS>
so
they
was
n't
axed
different
from
us
at
all
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Betsey
says
that
Gregory
says
that
madam
was
n't
a
bit
too
well
pleased
to
see
them
where
they
was
,
and
that
to
his
believing
they
was
expected
to
come
here
just
like
the
rest
of
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
great
consolation
in
this
.
<EOS>
Not
that
Mrs.
Greenacre
was
altogether
satisfied
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
justice
to
herself
demanded
that
Mrs.
Lookaloft
should
not
only
not
be
encouraged
,
but
that
she
should
also
be
absolutely
punished
.
<EOS>
What
had
been
done
at
that
scriptural
banquet
,
of
which
Mrs.
Greenacre
so
often
read
the
account
to
her
family
?
<EOS>
Why
had
not
Miss
Thorne
boldly
gone
to
the
intruder
and
said
,
"
Friend
,
thou
hast
come
up
hither
to
high
places
not
fitted
to
thee
.
<EOS>
Go
down
lower
,
and
thou
wilt
find
thy
mates
.
<EOS>
"
Let
the
Lookalofts
be
treated
at
the
present
moment
with
ever
so
cold
a
shoulder
,
they
would
still
be
enabled
to
boast
hereafter
of
their
position
,
their
aspirations
,
and
their
honour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
with
all
her
grandeur
,
I
do
wonder
that
she
be
so
mean
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Greenacre
,
unable
to
dismiss
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
hear
,
goodman
?
"
she
went
on
,
about
to
repeat
the
whole
story
to
her
husband
who
then
came
up
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
Dame
Lookaloft
and
Bab
and
Gussy
and
the
lot
of
"
em
all
sitting
as
grand
as
fivepence
in
madam
's
drawing
-
room
,
and
they
not
axed
no
more
nor
you
nor
me
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
hear
tell
the
like
o
'
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
and
what
for
should
n't
they
?
"
said
Farmer
Greenacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
Likening
theyselves
to
the
quality
,
as
though
they
was
estated
folk
,
or
the
like
o
'
that
!
"
said
Mrs.
Guffern
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
they
likes
it
,
and
madam
likes
it
,
they
's
welcome
for
me
,
"
said
the
farmer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
I
likes
this
place
better
,
"
cause
I
be
more
at
<EOS>
home
-
like
,
and
do
n't
have
to
pay
for
them
fine
clothes
for
the
missus
.
<EOS>
Everyone
to
his
taste
,
Mrs.
Guffern
,
and
if
neighbour
Lookaloft
thinks
that
he
has
the
best
of
it
,
he
's
welcome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenacre
sat
down
by
her
husband
's
side
to
begin
the
heavy
work
of
the
banquet
,
and
she
did
so
in
some
measure
with
restored
tranquillity
,
but
nevertheless
she
shook
her
head
at
her
gossip
to
show
that
in
this
instance
she
did
not
quite
approve
of
her
husband
's
doctrine
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
'll
tell
"
ee
what
,
dames
,
"
continued
he
;
"
if
so
be
that
we
can
not
enjoy
the
dinner
that
madam
gives
us
because
Mother
Lookaloft
is
sitting
up
there
on
a
grand
sofa
,
I
think
we
ought
all
to
go
home
.
<EOS>
If
we
greet
at
that
,
what
'll
we
do
when
true
sorrow
comes
across
us
?
<EOS>
How
would
you
be
now
,
Dame
,
if
the
boy
there
had
broke
his
neck
when
he
got
the
tumble
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenacre
was
humbled
and
said
nothing
further
on
the
matter
.
<EOS>
But
let
prudent
men
such
as
Mr.
Greenacre
preach
as
they
will
,
the
family
of
the
Lookalofts
certainly
does
occasion
a
good
deal
of
heart
-
burning
in
the
world
at
large
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
pleasant
to
see
Mr.
Plomacy
as
,
leaning
on
his
stout
stick
,
he
went
about
among
the
rural
guests
,
acting
as
a
sort
of
head
constable
as
well
as
master
of
the
revels
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
young'un
,
if
you
ca
n't
manage
to
get
along
without
that
screeching
,
you
'd
better
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
twelve
-
acre
field
and
take
your
dinner
with
you
.
<EOS>
Come
,
girls
<EOS>
,
what
do
you
stand
there
for
,
twirling
of
your
thumbs
?
<EOS>
Come
out
,
and
let
the
lads
see
you
;
<EOS>
you
've
no
need
to
be
so
ashamed
of
your
faces
.
<EOS>
Hollo
there
,
who
are
you
?
<EOS>
How
did
you
make
your
way
in
here
?
"
  
<EOS>
This
last
disagreeable
question
was
put
to
a
young
man
of
about
twenty
-
four
who
did
not
,
in
Mr.
Plomacy
's
eye
,
bear
sufficient
vestiges
of
a
rural
education
and
residence
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
your
Worship
,
Master
Barrell
the
coachman
let
me
in
at
the
church
wicket
,
"
cause
I
do
be
working
mostly
al'ays
for
the
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
Master
Barrell
the
coachman
may
let
you
out
again
,
"
said
Mr.
Plomacy
,
not
even
conciliated
by
the
magisterial
dignity
which
had
been
conceded
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
your
name
?
<EOS>
And
what
trade
are
you
?
<EOS>
And
who
do
you
work
for
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
Stubbs
,
your
worship
,
Bob
Stubbs
;
and
 
and
 
and
 
"
  
"
And
what
's
your
trade
,
Stubbs
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Plasterer
,
please
your
worship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
plaster
you
,
and
Barrell
too
;
you
'll
just
walk
out
of
this
"
ere
field
as
quick
as
you
walked
in
.
<EOS>
We
do
n't
want
no
plasterers
;
when
we
do
,
we
'll
send
for
"
em
.
<EOS>
Come
my
buck
,
walk
.
"
  
<EOS>
Stubbs
the
plasterer
was
much
downcast
at
this
dreadful
edict
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
sprightly
fellow
,
and
had
contrived
since
his
ingress
into
the
Ullathorne
elysium
to
attract
to
himself
a
forest
nymph
,
to
whom
he
was
whispering
a
plasterer
's
usual
soft
nothings
,
when
he
was
encountered
by
the
great
Mr.
Plomacy
.
<EOS>
It
was
dreadful
to
be
thus
dissevered
from
his
dryad
and
sent
howling
back
to
a
Barchester
pandemonium
just
as
the
nectar
and
ambrosia
were
about
to
descend
on
the
fields
of
asphodel
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
try
what
prayers
would
do
,
but
city
prayers
were
vain
against
the
great
rural
potentate
.
<EOS>
Not
only
did
Mr.
Plomacy
order
his
exit
but
,
raising
his
stick
to
show
the
way
which
led
to
the
gate
that
had
been
left
in
the
custody
of
that
false
Cerberus
Barrell
,
proceeded
himself
to
see
the
edict
of
banishment
carried
out
.
  
<EOS>
The
goddess
Mercy
,
however
,
the
sweetest
goddess
that
ever
sat
upon
a
cloud
,
and
the
dearest
to
poor
,
frail
,
erring
man
,
appeared
on
the
field
in
the
person
of
Mr.
Greenacre
.
<EOS>
Never
was
interceding
goddess
more
welcome
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
man
,
"
said
Mr.
Greenacre
,
"
never
stick
at
trifles
such
a
day
as
this
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
lad
well
.
<EOS>
Let
him
bide
at
my
axing
.
<EOS>
Madam
wo
n't
miss
what
he
can
eat
and
drink
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
Mr.
Plomacy
and
Mr.
Greenacre
were
sworn
friends
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Plomacy
had
at
his
own
disposal
as
comfortable
a
room
as
there
was
in
Ullathorne
House
,
but
he
was
a
bachelor
,
and
alone
there
,
and
,
moreover
,
smoking
in
the
house
was
not
allowed
even
to
Mr.
Plomacy
.
<EOS>
His
moments
of
truest
happiness
were
spent
in
a
huge
armchair
in
the
warmest
corner
of
Mrs.
Greenacre
's
beautifully
clean
front
kitchen
.
<EOS>
"
Twas
there
that
the
inner
man
dissolved
itself
and
poured
itself
out
in
streams
of
pleasant
chat
;
"
twas
there
that
he
was
respected
and
yet
at
his
ease
;
"
twas
there
,
and
perhaps
there
only
,
that
he
could
unburden
himself
from
the
ceremonies
of
life
without
offending
the
dignity
of
those
above
him
,
or
incurring
the
familiarity
of
those
below
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twas
there
that
his
long
pipe
was
always
to
be
found
on
the
accustomed
chimney
-
board
,
not
only
permitted
but
encouraged
.
  
<EOS>
Such
being
the
state
of
the
case
,
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
Mr.
Plomacy
could
refuse
such
a
favour
to
Mr.
Greenacre
;
but
nevertheless
he
did
not
grant
it
without
some
further
show
of
austere
authority
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eat
and
drink
,
Mr.
Greenacre
!
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
what
he
eats
and
drinks
,
but
the
example
such
a
chap
shows
,
coming
in
where
he
's
not
invited
 
a
chap
of
his
age
,
too
.
<EOS>
He
too
<EOS>
that
never
did
a
day
's
work
about
Ullathorne
since
he
was
born
.
<EOS>
Plasterer
!
<EOS>
I
'll
plaster
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
worked
long
enough
for
me
,
then
,
Mr.
Plomacy
.
<EOS>
And
a
good
hand
he
is
at
setting
tiles
as
any
in
Barchester
,
"
said
the
other
,
not
sticking
quite
to
veracity
,
as
indeed
mercy
never
should
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
let
him
alone
to
-
day
and
quarrel
with
him
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
You
would
n't
shame
him
before
his
lass
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
goes
against
the
grain
with
me
,
then
,
"
said
Mr.
Plomacy
.
<EOS>
"
And
take
care
,
you
Stubbs
,
and
behave
yourself
.
<EOS>
If
I
hear
a
row
,
I
shall
know
where
it
comes
from
.
<EOS>
I
'm
up
to
you
Barchester
journeymen
;
I
know
what
stuff
you
're
made
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
Stubbs
went
off
happy
,
pulling
at
the
forelock
of
his
shock
head
of
hair
in
honour
of
the
steward
's
clemency
and
giving
another
double
pull
at
it
in
honour
of
the
farmer
's
kindness
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
went
he
swore
within
his
grateful
heart
that
if
ever
Farmer
Greenacre
wanted
a
day
's
work
done
for
nothing
,
he
was
the
lad
to
do
it
for
him
.
<EOS>
Which
promise
it
was
not
probable
that
he
would
ever
be
called
on
to
perform
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Plomacy
was
not
quite
happy
in
his
mind
,
for
he
thought
of
the
unjust
steward
and
began
to
reflect
whether
he
had
not
made
for
himself
friends
of
the
mammon
of
unrighteousness
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
did
not
interfere
with
the
manner
in
which
he
performed
his
duties
at
the
bottom
of
the
long
board
;
nor
did
Mr.
Greenacre
perform
his
the
worse
at
the
top
on
account
of
the
good
wishes
of
Stubbs
the
plasterer
.
<EOS>
Moreover
the
guests
did
not
think
it
anything
amiss
when
Mr.
Plomacy
,
rising
to
say
grace
,
prayed
that
God
would
make
them
all
truly
thankful
for
the
good
things
which
Madame
Thorne
in
her
great
liberality
had
set
before
them
!
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
the
quality
in
the
tent
on
the
lawn
were
getting
on
swimmingly
 
that
is
,
if
champagne
without
restriction
can
enable
quality
folk
to
swim
.
<EOS>
Sir
Harkaway
Gorse
proposed
the
health
of
Miss
Thorne
,
and
likened
her
to
a
blood
race
-
horse
,
always
in
condition
and
not
to
be
tired
down
by
any
amount
of
work
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
returned
thanks
,
saying
he
hoped
his
sister
would
always
be
found
able
to
run
when
called
upon
,
and
then
gave
the
health
and
prosperity
of
the
De
Courcy
family
.
<EOS>
His
sister
was
very
much
honoured
by
seeing
so
many
of
them
at
her
poor
board
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
aware
that
important
avocations
made
the
absence
of
the
earl
necessary
.
<EOS>
As
his
duty
to
his
prince
had
called
him
from
his
family
hearth
,
he
,
Mr.
Thorne
,
could
not
venture
to
regret
that
he
did
not
see
him
at
Ullathorne
;
but
nevertheless
he
would
venture
to
say
 
that
was
,
to
express
a
wish
 
<EOS>
an
opinion
<EOS>
,
he
meant
to
say
 
<EOS>
And
so
Mr.
Thorne
became
somewhat
gravelled
,
as
country
gentlemen
in
similar
circumstances
usually
do
;
but
he
ultimately
sat
down
,
declaring
that
he
had
much
satisfaction
in
drinking
the
noble
earl
's
health
,
together
with
that
of
the
countess
,
and
all
the
family
of
De
Courcy
Castle
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
the
Honourable
George
returned
thanks
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
follow
him
through
the
different
periods
of
his
somewhat
irregular
eloquence
.
<EOS>
Those
immediately
in
his
neighbourhood
found
it
at
first
rather
difficult
to
get
him
on
his
legs
,
but
much
greater
difficulty
was
soon
experienced
in
inducing
him
to
resume
his
seat
.
<EOS>
One
of
two
arrangements
should
certainly
be
made
in
these
days
:
either
let
all
speech
-
making
on
festive
occasions
be
utterly
tabooed
and
made
as
it
were
impossible
;
or
else
let
those
who
are
to
exercise
the
privilege
be
first
subjected
to
a
competing
examination
before
the
civil
-
service
examining
commissioners
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
now
,
the
Honourable
Georges
do
but
little
honour
to
our
exertions
in
favour
of
British
education
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
dining
-
room
the
bishop
went
through
the
honours
of
the
day
with
much
more
neatness
and
propriety
.
<EOS>
He
also
drank
Miss
Thorne
's
health
,
and
did
it
in
a
manner
becoming
the
bench
which
he
adorned
.
<EOS>
The
party
there
was
perhaps
a
little
more
dull
,
a
shade
less
lively
than
that
in
the
tent
.
<EOS>
But
what
was
lost
in
mirth
was
fully
made
up
in
decorum
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
the
banquets
passed
off
at
the
various
tables
with
great
éclat
and
universal
delight
.
   
<EOS>
Ullathorne
Sports
 
<EOS>
Act
II
 
"
<EOS>
That
which
has
made
them
drunk
has
made
me
bold
.
"
<EOS>
"
Twas
thus
that
Mr.
Slope
encouraged
himself
,
as
he
left
the
dining
-
room
in
pursuit
of
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
indeed
seen
in
that
room
any
person
really
intoxicated
,
but
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
wine
drunk
,
and
Mr.
Slope
had
not
hesitated
to
take
his
share
,
in
order
to
screw
himself
up
to
the
undertaking
which
he
had
in
hand
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
the
first
man
who
has
thought
it
expedient
to
call
in
the
assistance
of
Bacchus
on
such
an
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
was
out
through
the
window
and
on
the
grass
before
she
perceived
that
she
was
followed
.
<EOS>
Just
at
that
moment
the
guests
were
nearly
all
occupied
at
the
tables
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
were
to
be
seen
a
constant
couple
or
two
,
who
preferred
their
own
sweet
discourse
to
the
jingle
of
glasses
or
the
charms
of
rhetoric
which
fell
from
the
mouths
of
the
Honourable
George
and
the
Bishop
of
Barchester
;
but
the
grounds
were
as
nearly
vacant
as
Mr.
Slope
could
wish
them
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
saw
that
she
was
pursued
,
and
as
a
deer
,
when
escape
is
no
longer
possible
,
will
turn
to
bay
and
attack
the
hounds
,
so
did
she
turn
upon
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
let
me
take
you
from
the
room
,
"
said
she
,
speaking
with
all
the
stiffness
which
she
knew
how
to
use
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
out
to
look
for
a
friend
.
<EOS>
I
must
beg
of
you
,
Mr.
Slope
,
to
go
back
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Slope
would
not
be
thus
entreated
.
<EOS>
He
had
observed
all
day
that
Mrs.
Bold
was
not
cordial
to
him
,
and
this
had
to
a
certain
extent
oppressed
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
deduce
from
this
any
assurance
that
his
aspirations
were
in
vain
.
<EOS>
He
saw
that
she
was
angry
with
him
.
<EOS>
Might
she
not
be
so
because
he
had
so
long
tampered
with
her
feelings
 
<EOS>
might
it
not
arise
from
his
having
,
as
he
knew
was
the
case
,
caused
her
name
to
be
bruited
about
in
conjunction
with
his
own
without
having
given
her
the
opportunity
of
confessing
to
the
world
that
henceforth
their
names
were
to
be
one
and
the
same
?
<EOS>
Poor
lady
.
<EOS>
He
had
within
him
a
certain
Christian
conscience
-
stricken
feeling
of
remorse
on
this
head
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
that
he
had
wronged
her
by
his
tardiness
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
however
,
at
the
present
moment
imbibed
too
much
of
Mr.
Thorne
's
champagne
to
have
any
inward
misgivings
.
<EOS>
He
was
right
in
repeating
the
boast
of
Lady
Macbeth
:
he
was
not
drunk
,
but
he
was
bold
enough
for
anything
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
pity
that
in
such
a
state
he
could
not
have
encountered
Mrs.
Proudie
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
permit
me
to
attend
you
,
"
said
he
;
"
I
could
not
think
of
allowing
you
to
go
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
you
must
,
Mr.
Slope
,
"
said
Eleanor
still
very
stiffly
,
"
<EOS>
for
it
is
my
special
wish
to
be
alone
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
time
for
letting
the
great
secret
escape
him
had
already
come
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
saw
that
it
must
be
now
or
never
,
and
he
was
determined
that
it
should
be
now
.
<EOS>
This
was
not
his
first
attempt
at
winning
a
fair
lady
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
on
his
knees
,
looked
unutterable
things
with
his
eyes
,
and
whispered
honeyed
words
before
this
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
was
somewhat
an
adept
at
these
things
,
and
had
only
to
adapt
to
the
perhaps
different
taste
of
Mrs.
Bold
the
well
-
remembered
rhapsodies
which
had
once
so
much
gratified
Olivia
Proudie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
ask
me
to
leave
you
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
"
said
he
with
an
impassioned
look
,
impassioned
and
sanctified
as
well
,
with
that
sort
of
look
which
is
not
uncommon
with
gentlemen
of
Mr.
Slope
's
school
and
which
may
perhaps
be
called
the
tender
-
pious
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
ask
me
to
leave
you
till
I
have
spoken
a
few
words
with
which
my
heart
is
full
 
which
I
have
come
hither
purposely
to
say
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
saw
how
it
was
now
.
<EOS>
She
knew
directly
what
it
was
she
was
about
to
go
through
,
and
very
miserable
the
knowledge
made
her
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
could
refuse
Mr.
Slope
,
and
there
would
be
an
end
of
that
,
one
might
say
.
<EOS>
But
there
would
not
be
an
end
of
it
,
as
far
as
Eleanor
was
concerned
.
<EOS>
The
very
fact
of
Mr.
Slope
's
making
an
offer
to
her
would
be
a
triumph
to
the
archdeacon
and
,
in
a
great
measure
,
a
vindication
of
Mr.
Arabin
's
conduct
.
<EOS>
The
widow
could
not
bring
herself
to
endure
with
patience
the
idea
that
she
had
been
in
the
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
had
defended
Mr.
Slope
,
she
had
declared
herself
quite
justified
in
admitting
him
among
her
acquaintance
,
had
ridiculed
the
idea
of
his
considering
himself
as
more
than
an
acquaintance
,
and
had
resented
the
archdeacon
's
caution
in
her
behalf
:
now
it
was
about
to
be
proved
to
her
in
a
manner
sufficiently
disagreeable
that
the
archdeacon
had
been
right
,
and
she
herself
had
been
entirely
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
you
can
have
to
say
to
me
,
Mr.
Slope
,
that
you
could
not
have
said
when
we
were
sitting
at
table
just
now
;
"
and
she
closed
her
lips
,
and
steadied
her
eyeballs
,
and
looked
at
him
in
a
manner
that
ought
to
have
frozen
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
gentlemen
are
not
easily
frozen
when
they
are
full
of
champagne
,
and
it
would
not
at
any
time
have
been
easy
to
freeze
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
things
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
which
a
man
can
not
well
say
before
a
crowd
;
which
perhaps
he
can
not
well
say
at
any
time
;
which
indeed
he
may
most
fervently
desire
to
get
spoken
,
and
which
he
may
yet
find
it
almost
impossible
to
utter
.
<EOS>
It
is
such
things
as
these
that
I
now
wish
to
say
to
you
;
"
and
then
the
tender
-
pious
look
was
repeated
,
with
a
little
more
emphasis
even
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
had
not
found
it
practicable
to
stand
stock
still
before
the
dining
-
room
window
,
there
receive
his
offer
in
full
view
of
Miss
Thorne
's
guests
.
<EOS>
She
had
therefore
in
self
-
defence
walked
on
,
and
thus
Mr.
Slope
had
gained
his
object
of
walking
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
now
offered
her
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Mr.
Slope
,
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
;
but
for
the
very
short
time
that
I
shall
remain
with
you
I
shall
prefer
walking
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
must
it
be
so
short
?
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
Must
it
be
 
"
  
"
Yes
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
interrupting
him
,
"
as
short
as
possible
,
if
you
please
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
hoped
,
Mrs.
Bold
 
I
had
hoped
 
"
  
"
Pray
hope
nothing
,
Mr.
Slope
,
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
;
pray
do
not
;
I
do
not
know
and
need
not
know
what
hope
you
mean
.
<EOS>
Our
acquaintance
is
very
slight
,
and
will
probably
remain
so
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
pray
let
that
be
enough
;
there
is
at
any
rate
no
necessity
for
us
to
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
was
certainly
treating
Mr.
Slope
rather
cavalierly
,
and
he
felt
it
so
.
<EOS>
She
was
rejecting
him
before
he
had
offered
himself
,
and
informing
him
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
taking
a
great
deal
too
much
on
himself
to
be
so
familiar
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
even
make
an
attempt
  
From
such
a
sharp
and
waspish
word
as
"
no
"
To
pluck
the
sting
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
still
determined
to
be
very
tender
and
very
pious
,
seeing
that
,
in
spite
of
all
Mrs.
Bold
had
said
to
him
,
he
had
not
yet
abandoned
hope
;
but
he
was
inclined
also
to
be
somewhat
angry
.
<EOS>
The
widow
was
bearing
herself
,
as
he
thought
,
with
too
high
a
hand
,
was
speaking
of
herself
in
much
too
imperious
a
tone
.
<EOS>
She
had
clearly
no
idea
that
an
honour
was
being
conferred
on
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
would
be
tender
as
long
as
he
could
,
but
he
began
to
think
if
that
failed
it
would
not
be
amiss
if
he
also
mounted
himself
for
awhile
on
his
high
horse
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
could
undoubtedly
be
very
tender
,
but
he
could
be
very
savage
also
,
and
he
knew
his
own
abilities
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
cruel
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
unchristian
,
too
.
<EOS>
The
worst
of
us
are
still
bidden
to
hope
.
<EOS>
What
have
I
done
that
you
should
pass
on
me
<EOS>
so
severe
a
sentence
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
then
he
paused
a
moment
,
during
which
the
widow
walked
steadily
on
with
measured
steps
,
saying
nothing
further
.
  
<EOS>
"
Beautiful
woman
,
"
at
last
he
burst
forth
,
"
beautiful
woman
,
you
can
not
pretend
to
be
ignorant
that
I
adore
you
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
Eleanor
,
yes
,
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
I
love
you
with
the
truest
affection
which
man
can
bear
to
woman
.
<EOS>
Next
to
my
hopes
of
heaven
are
my
hopes
of
possessing
you
.
"
<EOS>
(
Mr.
Slope
's
memory
here
played
him
false
,
or
he
would
not
have
omitted
the
deanery
.
)
<EOS>
"
How
sweet
to
walk
to
heaven
with
you
by
my
side
,
with
you
for
my
guide
,
mutual
guides
.
<EOS>
Say
,
Eleanor
,
dearest
Eleanor
,
shall
we
walk
that
sweet
path
together
?
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
had
no
intention
of
ever
walking
together
with
Mr.
Slope
on
any
other
path
than
that
special
one
of
Miss
Thorne
's
which
they
now
occupied
,
but
as
she
had
been
unable
to
prevent
the
expression
of
Mr.
Slope
's
wishes
and
aspirations
,
she
resolved
to
hear
him
out
to
the
end
before
she
answered
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Eleanor
,
"
he
continued
,
and
it
seemed
to
be
his
idea
that
as
he
had
once
found
courage
to
pronounce
her
Christian
name
,
he
could
not
utter
it
often
enough
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
Eleanor
,
will
it
not
be
sweet
,
with
the
Lord
's
assistance
,
to
travel
hand
in
hand
through
this
mortal
valley
which
His
mercies
will
make
pleasant
to
us
,
till
hereafter
we
shall
dwell
together
at
the
foot
of
His
throne
?
"
<EOS>
And
then
a
more
tenderly
pious
glance
than
ever
beamed
from
the
lover
's
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
Eleanor
 
"
  
"
My
name
,
Mr.
Slope
,
is
Mrs.
Bold
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
who
,
though
determined
to
hear
out
the
tale
of
his
love
,
was
too
much
disgusted
by
his
blasphemy
to
be
able
to
bear
much
more
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sweetest
angel
,
be
not
so
cold
,
"
said
he
,
and
as
he
said
it
the
champagne
broke
forth
,
and
he
contrived
to
pass
his
arm
round
her
waist
.
<EOS>
He
did
this
with
considerable
cleverness
,
for
up
to
this
point
Eleanor
had
contrived
with
tolerable
success
to
keep
her
distance
from
him
.
<EOS>
They
had
got
into
a
walk
nearly
enveloped
by
shrubs
,
and
Mr.
Slope
therefore
no
doubt
considered
that
as
they
were
now
alone
it
was
fitting
that
he
should
give
her
some
outward
demonstration
of
that
affection
of
which
he
talked
so
much
.
<EOS>
It
may
perhaps
be
presumed
that
the
same
stamp
of
measures
had
been
found
to
succeed
with
Olivia
Proudie
.
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
it
was
not
successful
with
Eleanor
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
She
sprang
from
him
as
she
would
have
jumped
from
an
adder
,
but
she
did
not
spring
far
 
not
,
indeed
,
beyond
arm
's
length
 
and
then
,
quick
as
thought
<EOS>
,
she
raised
her
little
hand
and
dealt
him
a
box
on
the
ear
with
such
right
goodwill
that
it
sounded
among
the
trees
like
a
miniature
thunderclap
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
it
is
to
be
feared
that
every
well
-
bred
reader
of
these
pages
will
lay
down
the
book
with
disgust
,
feeling
that
,
after
all
,
the
heroine
is
unworthy
of
sympathy
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
hoyden
,
one
will
say
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
she
is
not
a
lady
,
another
will
exclaim
.
<EOS>
I
have
suspected
her
all
through
,
a
third
will
declare
;
she
has
no
idea
of
the
dignity
of
a
matron
,
or
of
the
peculiar
propriety
which
her
position
demands
.
<EOS>
At
one
moment
she
is
romping
with
young
Stanhope
;
then
she
is
making
eyes
at
Mr.
Arabin
;
anon
she
comes
to
fisticuffs
with
a
third
lover
 
and
all
before
she
is
yet
a
widow
of
two
years
"
standing
.
  
<EOS>
She
can
not
altogether
be
defended
,
and
yet
it
may
be
averred
that
she
is
not
a
hoyden
,
not
given
to
romping
nor
prone
to
boxing
.
<EOS>
It
were
to
be
wished
devoutly
that
she
had
not
struck
Mr.
Slope
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
In
doing
so
she
derogated
from
her
dignity
and
committed
herself
.
<EOS>
Had
she
been
educated
in
Belgravia
,
had
she
been
brought
up
by
any
sterner
mentor
than
that
fond
father
,
had
she
lived
longer
under
the
rule
of
a
husband
<EOS>
,
she
might
,
perhaps
,
have
saved
herself
from
this
great
fault
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
the
provocation
was
too
much
for
her
,
the
temptation
to
instant
resentment
of
the
insult
too
strong
.
<EOS>
She
was
too
keen
in
the
feeling
of
independence
,
a
feeling
dangerous
for
a
young
woman
,
but
one
in
which
her
position
peculiarly
tempted
her
to
indulge
.
<EOS>
And
then
Mr.
Slope
's
face
,
tinted
with
a
deeper
dye
than
usual
by
the
wine
he
had
drunk
,
simpering
and
puckering
itself
with
pseudo
-
pity
and
tender
grimaces
,
seemed
specially
to
call
for
such
punishment
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
too
,
a
true
instinct
as
to
the
man
;
he
was
capable
of
rebuke
in
this
way
and
in
no
other
.
<EOS>
To
him
the
blow
from
her
little
hand
was
as
much
an
insult
as
a
blow
from
a
man
would
have
been
to
another
.
<EOS>
It
went
directly
to
his
pride
.
<EOS>
He
conceived
himself
lowered
in
his
dignity
and
personally
outraged
.
<EOS>
He
could
almost
have
struck
at
her
again
in
his
rage
.
<EOS>
Even
the
pain
was
a
great
annoyance
to
him
,
and
the
feeling
that
his
clerical
character
had
been
wholly
disregarded
sorely
vexed
him
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
such
men
:
men
who
can
endure
no
taint
on
their
personal
self
-
respect
,
even
from
a
woman
;
men
whose
bodies
are
to
themselves
such
sacred
temples
that
a
joke
against
them
is
desecration
,
and
a
rough
touch
downright
sacrilege
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
was
such
a
man
,
and
therefore
the
slap
on
the
face
that
he
got
from
Eleanor
was
,
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
,
the
fittest
rebuke
which
could
have
been
administered
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
nevertheless
,
she
should
not
have
raised
her
hand
against
the
man
.
<EOS>
Ladies
"
hands
,
so
soft
,
so
sweet
,
so
delicious
to
the
touch
,
so
graceful
to
the
eye
,
so
gracious
in
their
gentle
doings
,
were
not
made
to
belabour
men
's
faces
.
<EOS>
The
moment
the
deed
was
done
Eleanor
felt
that
she
had
sinned
against
all
propriety
,
and
would
have
given
little
worlds
to
recall
the
blow
.
<EOS>
In
her
first
agony
of
sorrow
she
all
but
begged
the
man
's
pardon
.
<EOS>
Her
next
impulse
,
however
,
and
the
one
which
she
obeyed
,
was
to
run
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
,
never
will
speak
another
word
to
you
,
"
she
said
,
gasping
with
emotion
and
the
loss
of
breath
which
her
exertion
and
violent
feelings
occasioned
her
,
and
so
saying
she
put
foot
to
the
ground
and
ran
quickly
back
along
the
path
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
But
how
shall
I
sing
the
divine
wrath
of
Mr.
Slope
,
or
how
invoke
the
tragic
muse
to
describe
the
rage
which
swelled
the
celestial
bosom
of
the
bishop
's
chaplain
?
<EOS>
Such
an
undertaking
by
no
means
befits
the
low
-
heeled
buskin
of
modern
fiction
.
<EOS>
The
painter
put
a
veil
over
Agamemnon
's
face
when
called
on
to
depict
the
father
's
grief
at
the
early
doom
of
his
devoted
daughter
.
<EOS>
The
god
,
when
he
resolved
to
punish
the
rebellious
winds
,
abstained
from
mouthing
empty
threats
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
attempt
to
tell
with
what
mighty
surgings
of
the
inner
heart
Mr.
Slope
swore
to
revenge
himself
on
the
woman
who
had
disgraced
him
,
nor
will
we
vainly
strive
to
depict
his
deep
agony
of
soul
.
  
<EOS>
There
he
is
,
however
,
alone
in
the
garden
walk
,
and
we
must
contrive
to
bring
him
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
willing
to
come
forth
quite
at
once
.
<EOS>
His
cheek
was
stinging
with
the
weight
of
Eleanor
's
fingers
,
and
he
fancied
that
everyone
who
looked
at
him
would
be
able
to
see
on
his
face
the
traces
of
what
he
had
endured
.
<EOS>
He
stood
awhile
,
becoming
redder
and
redder
with
rage
.
<EOS>
He
stood
motionless
,
undecided
,
glaring
with
his
eyes
,
thinking
of
the
pains
and
penalties
of
Hades
,
and
meditating
how
he
might
best
devote
his
enemy
to
the
infernal
gods
with
all
the
passion
of
his
accustomed
eloquence
.
<EOS>
He
longed
in
his
heart
to
be
preaching
at
her
.
"
<EOS>
Twas
thus
that
he
was
ordinarily
avenged
of
sinning
mortal
men
and
women
.
<EOS>
Could
he
at
once
have
ascended
his
Sunday
rostrum
and
fulminated
at
her
such
denunciations
as
his
spirit
delighted
in
,
his
bosom
would
have
been
greatly
eased
.
  
<EOS>
But
how
preach
to
Mr.
Thorne
's
laurels
,
or
how
preach
indeed
at
all
in
such
a
vanity
fair
as
this
now
going
on
at
Ullathorne
?
<EOS>
And
then
he
began
to
feel
a
righteous
disgust
at
the
wickedness
of
the
doings
around
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
justly
chastised
for
lending
,
by
his
presence
,
a
sanction
to
such
worldly
lures
.
<EOS>
The
gaiety
of
society
,
the
mirth
of
banquets
,
the
laughter
of
the
young
,
and
the
eating
and
drinking
of
the
elders
were
,
for
awhile
,
without
excuse
in
his
sight
.
<EOS>
What
had
he
now
brought
down
upon
himself
by
sojourning
thus
in
the
tents
of
the
heathen
?
<EOS>
He
had
consorted
with
idolaters
round
the
altars
of
Baal
,
and
therefore
a
sore
punishment
had
come
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
then
thought
of
the
Signora
Neroni
,
and
his
soul
within
him
was
full
of
sorrow
.
<EOS>
He
had
an
inkling
 
a
true
inkling
 
that
he
was
a
wicked
,
sinful
man
,
but
it
led
him
in
no
right
direction
;
he
could
admit
no
charity
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
felt
debasement
coming
on
him
,
and
he
longed
to
shake
it
off
,
to
rise
up
in
his
stirrup
,
to
mount
to
high
places
and
great
power
,
that
he
might
get
up
into
a
mighty
pulpit
and
preach
to
the
world
a
loud
sermon
against
Mrs.
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
There
he
stood
fixed
to
the
gravel
for
about
ten
minutes
.
<EOS>
Fortune
favoured
him
so
far
that
no
prying
eyes
came
to
look
upon
him
in
his
misery
.
<EOS>
Then
a
shudder
passed
over
his
whole
frame
;
he
collected
himself
and
slowly
wound
his
way
round
to
the
lawn
,
advancing
along
the
path
and
not
returning
in
the
direction
which
Eleanor
had
taken
.
<EOS>
When
he
reached
the
tent
,
he
found
the
bishop
standing
there
in
conversation
with
the
Master
of
Lazarus
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
had
come
out
to
air
himself
after
the
exertion
of
his
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
very
pleasant
 
very
pleasant
,
my
lord
,
is
it
not
?
"
said
Mr.
Slope
with
his
most
gracious
smile
,
pointing
to
the
tent
;
"
very
pleasant
.
<EOS>
It
is
delightful
to
see
so
many
persons
enjoying
themselves
so
thoroughly
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
thought
he
might
force
the
bishop
to
introduce
him
to
Dr.
Gwynne
.
<EOS>
A
very
great
example
had
declared
and
practised
the
wisdom
of
being
everything
to
everybody
,
and
Mr.
Slope
was
desirous
of
following
it
.
<EOS>
His
maxim
was
never
to
lose
a
chance
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
,
however
,
at
the
present
moment
was
not
very
anxious
to
increase
Mr.
Slope
's
circle
of
acquaintance
among
his
clerical
brethren
.
<EOS>
He
had
his
own
reasons
for
dropping
any
marked
allusion
to
his
domestic
chaplain
,
and
he
therefore
made
his
shoulder
rather
cold
for
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
,
very
,
"
said
he
without
turning
round
,
or
even
deigning
to
look
at
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
therefore
,
Dr.
Gwynne
,
I
really
think
that
you
will
find
that
the
hebdomadal
board
will
exercise
as
wide
and
as
general
an
authority
as
at
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
I
,
for
one
,
Dr.
Gwynne
 
"
  
"
Dr.
Gwynne
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
raising
his
hat
and
resolving
not
to
be
outwitted
by
such
an
insignificant
little
goose
as
the
Bishop
of
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
The
Master
of
Lazarus
also
raised
his
hat
and
bowed
very
politely
to
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
more
courteous
gentleman
in
the
queen
's
dominions
than
the
Master
of
Lazarus
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
"
pray
do
me
the
honour
of
introducing
me
to
Dr.
Gwynne
.
<EOS>
The
opportunity
is
too
much
in
my
favour
to
be
lost
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
had
no
help
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
My
chaplain
,
Dr.
Gwynne
,
"
said
he
,
"
my
present
chaplain
,
Mr.
Slope
.
"
<EOS>
He
certainly
made
the
introduction
as
unsatisfactory
to
the
chaplain
as
possible
,
and
by
the
use
of
the
word
"
present
"
seemed
to
indicate
that
Mr.
Slope
might
probably
not
long
enjoy
the
honour
which
he
now
held
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Slope
cared
nothing
for
this
.
<EOS>
He
understood
the
innuendo
,
and
disregarded
it
.
<EOS>
It
might
probably
come
to
pass
that
he
would
be
in
a
situation
to
resign
his
chaplaincy
before
the
bishop
was
in
a
situation
to
dismiss
him
from
it
.
<EOS>
What
need
the
future
Dean
of
Barchester
care
for
the
bishop
,
or
for
the
bishop
's
wife
?
<EOS>
Had
not
Mr.
Slope
,
just
as
he
was
entering
Dr.
Stanhope
's
carriage
,
received
an
all
-
important
note
from
Tom
Towers
of
"
The
Jupiter
"
?
<EOS>
Had
he
not
that
note
this
moment
in
his
pocket
?
  
<EOS>
So
disregarding
the
bishop
,
he
began
to
open
out
a
conversation
with
the
Master
of
Lazarus
.
  
<EOS>
But
suddenly
an
interruption
came
,
not
altogether
unwelcome
to
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
bishop
's
servants
came
up
to
his
master
's
shoulder
with
a
long
,
grave
face
and
whispered
into
the
bishop
's
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
,
John
?
"
said
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
dean
,
my
lord
;
he
is
dead
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
no
further
desire
to
converse
with
the
Master
of
Lazarus
,
and
was
very
soon
on
his
road
back
to
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
as
we
have
said
,
having
declared
her
intention
of
never
holding
further
communication
with
Mr.
Slope
,
ran
hurriedly
back
towards
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
thought
,
however
,
of
what
she
had
done
grieved
her
greatly
,
and
she
could
not
abstain
from
bursting
into
tears
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twas
<EOS>
thus
she
played
the
second
act
in
that
day
's
melodrama
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
Confides
Her
Sorrow
to
Her
Friend
Miss
Stanhope
 
<EOS>
When
Mrs.
Bold
came
to
the
end
of
the
walk
and
faced
the
lawn
,
she
began
to
bethink
herself
what
she
should
do
.
<EOS>
Was
she
to
wait
there
till
Mr.
Slope
caught
her
,
or
was
she
to
go
in
among
the
crowd
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
passion
in
her
face
?
<EOS>
She
might
in
truth
have
stood
there
long
enough
without
any
reasonable
fear
of
further
immediate
persecution
from
Mr.
Slope
,
but
we
are
all
inclined
to
magnify
the
bugbears
which
frighten
us
.
<EOS>
In
her
present
state
of
dread
she
did
not
know
of
what
atrocity
he
might
venture
to
be
guilty
.
<EOS>
Had
anyone
told
her
a
week
ago
that
he
would
have
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
at
this
party
of
Miss
Thorne
's
,
she
would
have
been
utterly
incredulous
.
<EOS>
Had
she
been
informed
that
he
would
be
seen
on
the
following
Sunday
walking
down
the
High
Street
in
a
scarlet
coat
and
top
boots
<EOS>
,
she
would
not
have
thought
such
a
phenomenon
more
improbable
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
improbable
iniquity
he
had
committed
,
and
now
there
was
nothing
she
could
not
believe
of
him
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
it
was
quite
manifest
that
he
was
tipsy
;
in
the
next
place
it
was
to
be
taken
as
proved
that
all
his
religion
was
sheer
hypocrisy
;
and
finally
the
man
was
utterly
shameless
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
stood
watching
for
the
sound
of
his
footfall
,
not
without
some
fear
that
he
might
creep
out
at
her
suddenly
from
among
the
bushes
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
thus
stood
she
saw
Charlotte
Stanhope
at
a
little
distance
from
her
,
walking
quickly
across
the
grass
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
's
handkerchief
was
in
her
hand
,
and
putting
it
to
her
face
so
as
to
conceal
her
tears
,
she
ran
across
the
lawn
and
joined
her
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Charlotte
,
"
she
said
,
almost
too
much
out
of
breath
to
speak
very
plainly
;
"
I
am
so
glad
I
have
found
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Glad
you
have
found
me
!
"
<EOS>
said
Charlotte
,
laughing
;
<EOS>
"
that
's
a
good
joke
.
<EOS>
Why
Bertie
and
I
have
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
.
<EOS>
He
swears
that
you
have
gone
off
with
Mr.
Slope
,
and
is
now
on
the
point
of
hanging
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Charlotte
,
do
n't
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
child
,
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
you
?
"
said
Miss
Stanhope
,
perceiving
that
Eleanor
's
hand
trembled
on
her
own
arm
,
and
finding
also
that
her
companion
was
still
half
-
choked
by
tears
.
"
<EOS>
Goodness
heaven
!
<EOS>
Something
has
distressed
you
.
<EOS>
What
is
it
?
<EOS>
What
can
I
do
for
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
answered
her
only
by
a
sort
of
spasmodic
gurgle
in
her
throat
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
good
deal
upset
,
as
people
say
,
and
could
not
at
the
moment
collect
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
here
,
this
way
,
Mrs.
Bold
;
come
this
way
,
and
we
shall
not
be
seen
.
<EOS>
What
has
happened
to
vex
you
so
?
<EOS>
What
can
I
do
for
you
?
<EOS>
Can
Bertie
do
anything
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
no
,
no
,
no
,
"
said
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
Only
that
horrid
man
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
What
horrid
man
?
"
asked
Charlotte
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
some
moments
in
life
in
which
both
men
and
women
feel
themselves
imperatively
called
on
to
make
a
confidence
,
in
which
not
to
do
so
requires
a
disagreeable
resolution
and
also
a
disagreeable
suspicion
.
<EOS>
There
are
people
of
both
sexes
who
never
make
confidences
,
who
are
never
tempted
by
momentary
circumstances
to
disclose
their
secrets
,
but
such
are
generally
dull
,
close
,
unimpassioned
spirits
,
"
gloomy
gnomes
,
who
live
in
cold
dark
mines
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
nothing
of
the
gnome
about
Eleanor
,
and
she
therefore
resolved
to
tell
Charlotte
Stanhope
the
whole
story
about
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
horrid
man
;
that
Mr.
Slope
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did
you
not
see
that
he
followed
me
out
of
the
dining
-
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
did
,
and
was
sorry
enough
,
but
I
could
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
knew
you
would
be
annoyed
.
<EOS>
But
you
and
Bertie
managed
it
badly
between
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
his
fault
nor
mine
either
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
I
disliked
the
idea
of
coming
in
the
carriage
with
that
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
am
very
sorry
if
that
has
led
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
has
led
to
it
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
almost
crying
again
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
has
not
been
my
fault
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
has
he
done
,
my
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
an
abominable
,
horrid
,
hypocritical
man
,
and
it
would
serve
him
right
to
tell
the
bishop
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Believe
me
,
if
you
want
to
do
him
an
injury
,
you
had
far
better
tell
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
But
what
did
he
do
,
Mrs.
Bold
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ugh
!
"
exclaimed
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
must
confess
he
's
not
very
nice
,
"
said
Charlotte
Stanhope
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nice
!
"
said
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
the
most
fulsome
,
fawning
,
abominable
man
I
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
What
business
had
he
to
come
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
that
never
gave
him
the
slightest
tittle
of
encouragement
 
I
that
always
hated
him
,
though
I
did
take
his
part
when
others
ran
him
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
just
where
it
is
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
He
has
heard
that
and
therefore
fancied
that
of
course
you
were
in
love
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
wormwood
to
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
fact
the
very
thing
which
all
her
friends
had
been
saying
for
the
last
month
past
 
and
which
experience
now
proved
to
be
true
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
resolved
within
herself
that
she
would
never
again
take
any
man
's
part
.
<EOS>
The
world
,
with
all
its
villainy
and
all
its
ill
-
nature
,
might
wag
as
it
liked
:
she
would
not
again
attempt
to
set
crooked
things
straight
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
did
he
do
,
my
dear
?
"
said
Charlotte
,
who
was
really
rather
interested
in
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
 
he
 
he
 
"
  
"
Well
 
come
,
it
ca
n't
have
been
anything
so
very
horrid
,
for
the
man
was
not
tipsy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
am
sure
he
was
"
said
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
he
must
have
been
tipsy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
declare
I
did
n't
observe
it
.
<EOS>
But
what
was
it
,
my
love
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
believe
I
can
hardly
tell
you
.
<EOS>
He
talked
such
horrid
stuff
that
you
never
heard
the
like
:
about
religion
,
and
heaven
,
and
love
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
dear
 
he
is
such
a
nasty
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
easily
imagine
the
sort
of
stuff
he
would
talk
.
<EOS>
Well
 
<EOS>
and
then
 
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
 
he
took
hold
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Took
hold
of
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
he
somehow
got
close
to
me
and
took
hold
of
me
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
By
the
waist
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Eleanor
shuddering
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
 
"
  
"
Then
I
jumped
away
from
him
,
and
gave
him
a
slap
on
the
face
,
and
ran
away
along
the
path
till
I
saw
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
Charlotte
Stanhope
laughed
heartily
at
the
finale
to
the
tragedy
.
<EOS>
It
was
delightful
to
her
to
think
that
Mr.
Slope
had
had
his
ears
boxed
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
quite
appreciate
the
feeling
which
made
her
friend
so
unhappy
at
the
result
of
the
interview
.
<EOS>
To
her
thinking
the
matter
had
ended
happily
enough
as
regarded
the
widow
,
who
indeed
was
entitled
to
some
sort
of
triumph
among
her
friends
.
<EOS>
Whereas
to
Mr.
Slope
would
be
due
all
those
gibes
and
jeers
which
would
naturally
follow
such
an
affair
.
<EOS>
His
friends
would
ask
him
whether
his
ears
tingled
whenever
he
saw
a
widow
,
and
he
would
be
cautioned
that
beautiful
things
were
made
to
be
looked
at
and
not
to
be
touched
.
  
<EOS>
Such
were
Charlotte
Stanhope
's
views
on
such
matters
,
but
she
did
not
at
the
present
moment
clearly
explain
them
to
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
Her
object
was
to
endear
herself
to
her
friend
,
and
therefore
,
having
had
her
laugh
,
she
was
ready
enough
to
offer
sympathy
.
<EOS>
Could
Bertie
do
anything
?
<EOS>
Should
Bertie
speak
to
the
man
and
warn
him
that
in
future
he
must
behave
with
more
decorum
?
<EOS>
Bertie
indeed
,
she
declared
,
would
be
more
angry
than
anyone
else
when
he
heard
to
what
insult
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
had
been
subjected
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
wo
n't
tell
him
?
"
said
Mrs.
Bold
with
a
look
of
horror
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
if
you
do
n't
like
it
,
"
said
Charlotte
;
"
but
considering
everything
,
I
would
strongly
advise
it
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
a
brother
,
you
know
,
it
would
be
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
very
right
that
Mr.
Slope
should
know
that
you
have
somebody
by
you
that
will
and
can
protect
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
my
father
is
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
it
is
so
disagreeable
for
clergymen
to
have
to
quarrel
with
each
other
;
and
circumstanced
as
your
father
is
just
at
this
moment
,
it
would
be
very
inexpedient
that
there
should
be
anything
unpleasant
between
him
and
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Surely
you
and
Bertie
are
intimate
enough
for
you
to
permit
him
to
take
your
part
.
"
  
<EOS>
Charlotte
Stanhope
was
very
anxious
that
her
brother
should
at
once
on
that
very
day
settle
matters
with
his
future
wife
.
<EOS>
Things
had
now
come
to
that
point
between
him
and
his
father
,
and
between
him
and
his
creditors
,
that
he
must
either
do
so
,
or
leave
Barchester
;
either
do
that
,
or
go
back
to
his
unwashed
associates
,
dirty
lodgings
,
and
poor
living
at
Carrara
.
<EOS>
Unless
he
could
provide
himself
with
an
income
,
he
must
go
to
Carrara
,
or
to
 
---
.
<EOS>
His
father
the
prebendary
had
not
said
this
in
so
many
words
,
but
had
he
done
so
,
he
could
not
have
signified
it
more
plainly
.
  
<EOS>
Such
being
the
state
of
the
case
it
was
very
necessary
that
no
more
time
should
be
lost
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
had
seen
her
brother
's
apathy
,
when
he
neglected
to
follow
Mrs.
Bold
out
of
the
room
,
with
anger
which
she
could
hardly
suppress
.
<EOS>
It
was
grievous
to
think
that
Mr.
Slope
should
have
so
distanced
him
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
felt
that
she
had
played
her
part
with
sufficient
skill
.
<EOS>
She
had
brought
them
together
and
induced
such
a
degree
of
intimacy
that
her
brother
was
really
relieved
from
all
trouble
and
labour
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
And
moreover
it
was
quite
plain
that
Mrs.
Bold
was
very
fond
of
Bertie
.
<EOS>
And
now
it
was
plain
enough
also
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
from
his
rival
,
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
certainly
an
awkwardness
in
subjecting
Mrs.
Bold
to
a
second
offer
on
the
same
day
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
well
perhaps
to
have
put
the
matter
off
for
a
week
,
could
a
week
have
been
spared
.
<EOS>
But
circumstances
are
frequently
too
peremptory
to
be
arranged
as
we
would
wish
to
arrange
them
,
and
such
was
the
case
now
.
<EOS>
This
being
so
,
could
not
this
affair
of
Mr.
Slope
's
be
turned
to
advantage
?
<EOS>
Could
it
not
be
made
the
excuse
for
bringing
Bertie
and
Mrs.
Bold
into
still
closer
connexion
 
into
such
close
connexion
that
they
could
not
fail
to
throw
themselves
into
each
other
's
arms
?
<EOS>
Such
was
the
game
which
Miss
Stanhope
now
at
a
moment
's
notice
resolved
to
play
.
  
<EOS>
And
very
well
she
played
it
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
it
was
arranged
that
Mr.
Slope
should
not
return
in
the
Stanhopes
"
carriage
to
Barchester
.
<EOS>
It
so
happened
that
Mr.
Slope
was
already
gone
,
but
of
that
of
course
they
knew
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
signora
should
be
induced
to
go
first
,
with
only
the
servants
and
her
sister
,
and
Bertie
should
take
Mr.
Slope
's
place
in
the
second
journey
.
<EOS>
Bertie
was
to
be
told
in
confidence
of
the
whole
affair
,
and
when
the
carriage
was
gone
off
with
its
first
load
,
Eleanor
was
to
be
left
under
Bertie
's
special
protection
,
so
as
to
insure
her
from
any
further
aggression
from
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
While
the
carriage
was
getting
ready
,
Bertie
was
to
seek
out
that
gentleman
and
make
him
understand
that
he
must
provide
himself
with
another
conveyance
back
to
Barchester
.
<EOS>
Their
immediate
object
should
be
to
walk
about
together
in
search
of
Bertie
.
<EOS>
Bertie
in
short
was
to
be
the
Pegasus
on
whose
wings
they
were
to
ride
out
of
their
present
dilemma
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
warmth
of
friendship
and
cordial
kindliness
in
all
this
that
was
very
soothing
to
the
widow
;
but
<EOS>
yet
,
though
she
gave
way
to
it
,
she
was
hardly
reconciled
to
doing
so
.
<EOS>
It
never
occurred
to
her
that
,
now
that
she
had
killed
one
dragon
,
another
was
about
to
spring
up
in
her
path
;
she
had
no
remote
idea
that
she
would
have
to
encounter
another
suitor
in
her
proposed
protector
,
but
she
hardly
liked
the
thought
of
putting
herself
so
much
into
the
hands
of
young
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
if
she
wanted
protection
,
she
should
go
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
she
should
ask
him
to
provide
a
carriage
for
her
back
to
Barchester
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clantantram
she
knew
would
give
her
a
seat
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
she
should
not
throw
herself
entirely
upon
friends
whose
friendship
dated
,
as
it
were
,
but
from
yesterday
.
<EOS>
But
yet
she
could
not
say
no
to
one
who
was
so
sisterly
in
her
kindness
,
so
eager
in
her
good
nature
,
so
comfortably
sympathetic
as
Charlotte
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
And
thus
she
gave
way
to
all
the
propositions
made
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
They
first
went
into
the
dining
-
room
,
looking
for
their
champion
,
and
from
thence
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Here
they
found
Mr.
Arabin
,
still
hanging
over
the
signora
's
sofa
;
or
rather
they
found
him
sitting
near
her
head
,
as
a
physician
might
have
sat
had
the
lady
been
his
patient
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
other
person
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
guests
were
some
in
the
tent
,
some
few
still
in
the
dining
room
,
some
at
the
bows
and
arrows
,
but
most
of
them
walking
with
Miss
Thorne
through
the
park
and
looking
at
the
games
that
were
going
on
.
  
<EOS>
All
that
had
passed
,
and
was
passing
between
Mr.
Arabin
and
the
lady
,
it
is
unnecessary
to
give
in
detail
.
<EOS>
She
was
doing
with
him
as
she
did
with
all
others
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
mission
to
make
fools
of
men
,
and
she
was
pursuing
her
mission
with
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
She
had
almost
got
him
to
own
his
love
for
Mrs.
Bold
and
had
subsequently
almost
induced
him
to
acknowledge
a
passion
for
herself
.
<EOS>
He
,
poor
man
,
was
hardly
aware
what
he
was
doing
or
saying
,
hardly
conscious
whether
was
in
heaven
or
in
hell
.
<EOS>
So
little
had
he
known
of
female
attractions
of
that
peculiar
class
which
the
signora
owned
,
that
he
became
affected
with
a
kind
of
temporary
delirium
when
first
subjected
to
its
power
.
<EOS>
He
lost
his
head
rather
than
this
heart
,
and
toppled
about
mentally
,
reeling
in
his
ideas
as
a
drunken
man
does
on
his
legs
.
<EOS>
She
had
whispered
to
him
words
that
really
meant
nothing
but
which
,
coming
from
such
beautiful
lips
and
accompanied
by
such
lustrous
glances
,
seemed
to
have
a
mysterious
significance
,
which
he
felt
though
he
could
not
understand
.
  
<EOS>
In
being
thus
besirened
,
Mr.
Arabin
behaved
himself
very
differently
from
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
The
signora
had
said
truly
that
the
two
men
were
the
contrasts
of
each
other
 
that
the
one
was
all
for
action
,
the
other
all
for
thought
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
when
this
lady
laid
upon
his
senses
the
overpowering
breath
of
her
charms
,
immediately
attempted
to
obtain
some
fruition
,
to
achieve
some
mighty
triumph
.
<EOS>
He
began
by
catching
at
her
hand
and
progressed
by
kissing
it
.
<EOS>
He
made
vows
of
love
and
asked
for
vows
in
return
.
<EOS>
He
promised
everlasting
devotion
,
knelt
before
her
,
and
swore
that
had
she
been
on
Mount
Ida
,
Juno
would
have
had
no
cause
to
hate
the
offspring
of
Venus
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Arabin
uttered
no
oaths
,
kept
his
hand
mostly
in
his
trousers
pocket
,
and
had
no
more
thought
of
kissing
Madame
Neroni
than
of
kissing
the
Countess
De
Courcy
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Mr.
Arabin
saw
Mrs.
Bold
enter
the
room
he
blushed
and
rose
from
his
chair
;
then
he
sat
down
again
,
and
then
again
got
up
.
<EOS>
The
signora
saw
the
blush
at
once
and
smiled
at
the
poor
victim
,
but
Eleanor
was
too
much
confused
to
see
anything
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Madeline
,
"
said
Charlotte
,
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
particularly
;
we
must
arrange
about
the
carriage
,
you
know
,
"
and
she
stooped
down
to
whisper
to
her
sister
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
immediately
withdrew
to
a
little
distance
,
and
as
Charlotte
had
in
fact
much
to
explain
before
she
could
make
the
new
carriage
arrangement
intelligible
,
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
talk
to
Mrs.
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
had
a
very
pleasant
party
,
"
said
he
,
using
the
tone
he
would
have
used
<EOS>
had
he
declared
that
the
sun
was
shining
very
brightly
,
or
the
rain
falling
very
fast
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
who
never
in
her
life
had
passed
a
more
unpleasant
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
Mr.
Harding
has
enjoyed
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
very
much
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
who
had
not
seen
her
father
since
she
parted
from
him
soon
after
her
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
returns
to
Barchester
to
-
night
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
believe
so
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
I
think
he
is
staying
at
Plumstead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
staying
at
Plumstead
,
"
said
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
came
from
there
this
morning
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
is
going
back
,
he
did
n't
exactly
say
,
however
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
Mrs.
Grantly
is
quite
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
seemed
to
be
quite
well
.
<EOS>
She
is
here
;
that
is
,
unless
she
has
gone
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
I
was
talking
to
her
.
<EOS>
Looking
very
well
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
Then
there
was
a
considerable
pause
;
for
Charlotte
could
not
at
once
make
Madeline
understand
why
she
was
to
be
sent
home
in
a
hurry
without
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
returning
to
Plumstead
,
Mrs.
Bold
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
merely
asked
this
by
way
of
making
conversation
,
but
he
immediately
perceived
that
he
was
approaching
dangerous
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bold
very
quietly
;
"
I
am
going
home
to
Barchester
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
ah
,
yes
.
<EOS>
I
had
forgotten
that
you
had
returned
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
Mr.
Arabin
,
finding
it
impossible
to
say
anything
further
,
stood
silent
till
Charlotte
had
completed
her
plans
,
and
Mrs.
Bold
stood
equally
silent
,
intently
occupied
as
it
appeared
in
the
arrangement
of
her
rings
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
these
two
people
were
thoroughly
in
love
with
each
other
;
and
though
one
was
a
middle
-
aged
clergyman
,
and
the
other
a
lady
at
any
rate
past
the
wishy
-
washy
bread
-
and
-
butter
period
of
life
,
they
were
as
unable
to
tell
their
own
minds
to
each
other
as
any
Damon
and
Phillis
,
whose
united
ages
would
not
make
up
that
to
which
Mr.
Arabin
had
already
attained
.
  
<EOS>
Madeline
Neroni
consented
to
her
sister
's
proposal
,
and
then
the
two
ladies
again
went
off
in
quest
of
Bertie
Stanhope
.
   
<EOS>
Ullathorne
Sports
 
<EOS>
Act
III
 
<EOS>
And
now
Miss
Thorne
's
guests
were
beginning
to
take
their
departure
,
and
the
amusement
of
those
who
remained
was
becoming
slack
.
<EOS>
It
was
getting
dark
,
and
ladies
in
morning
costumes
were
thinking
that
,
if
they
were
to
appear
by
candlelight
,
they
ought
to
readjust
themselves
.
<EOS>
Some
young
gentlemen
had
been
heard
to
talk
so
loud
that
prudent
mammas
determined
to
retire
judiciously
,
and
the
more
discreet
of
the
male
sex
,
whose
libations
had
been
moderate
,
felt
that
there
was
not
much
more
left
for
them
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
Morning
parties
,
as
a
rule
,
are
failures
.
<EOS>
People
never
know
how
to
get
away
from
them
gracefully
.
<EOS>
A
picnic
on
an
island
or
a
mountain
or
in
a
wood
may
perhaps
be
permitted
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
master
of
the
mountain
bound
by
courtesy
to
bid
you
stay
while
in
his
heart
he
is
longing
for
your
departure
.
<EOS>
But
in
a
private
house
or
in
private
grounds
a
morning
party
is
a
bore
.
<EOS>
One
is
called
on
to
eat
and
drink
at
unnatural
hours
.
<EOS>
One
is
obliged
to
give
up
the
day
,
which
is
useful
,
and
is
then
left
without
resource
for
the
evening
,
which
is
useless
.
<EOS>
One
gets
home
fagged
and
_
désoeuvré
_
,
and
yet
at
an
hour
too
early
for
bed
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
comfortable
resource
left
.
<EOS>
Cards
in
these
genteel
days
are
among
the
things
tabooed
,
and
a
rubber
of
whist
is
impracticable
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
began
now
to
be
felt
.
<EOS>
Some
young
people
had
come
with
some
amount
of
hope
that
they
might
get
up
a
dance
in
the
evening
,
and
were
unwilling
to
leave
till
<EOS>
all
such
hope
was
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
Others
,
fearful
of
staying
longer
than
was
expected
,
had
ordered
their
carriages
early
,
and
were
doing
their
best
to
go
,
solicitous
for
their
servants
and
horses
.
<EOS>
The
countess
and
her
noble
brood
were
among
the
first
to
leave
,
and
as
regarded
the
Hon
.
<EOS>
George
,
it
was
certainly
time
that
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
was
in
a
great
fret
and
fume
.
<EOS>
Those
horrid
roads
would
,
she
was
sure
,
be
the
death
of
her
if
unhappily
she
were
caught
in
them
by
the
dark
night
.
<EOS>
The
lamps
she
was
assured
were
good
,
but
no
lamp
could
withstand
the
jolting
of
the
roads
of
East
Barsetshire
.
<EOS>
The
De
Courcy
property
lay
in
the
western
division
of
the
county
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
could
not
stay
when
the
countess
was
gone
.
<EOS>
So
the
bishop
was
searched
for
by
the
Revs
.
<EOS>
Messrs.
Grey
and
Green
and
found
in
one
corner
of
the
tent
enjoying
himself
thoroughly
in
a
disquisition
on
the
hebdomadal
board
.
<EOS>
He
obeyed
,
however
,
the
behests
of
his
lady
without
finishing
the
sentence
in
which
he
was
promising
to
Dr.
Gwynne
that
his
authority
at
Oxford
should
remain
unimpaired
,
and
the
episcopal
horses
turned
their
noses
towards
the
palatial
stables
.
<EOS>
Then
the
Grantlys
went
.
<EOS>
Before
they
did
so
,
Mr.
Harding
managed
to
whisper
a
word
into
his
daughter
's
ear
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
he
said
,
he
would
undeceive
the
Grantlys
as
to
that
foolish
rumour
about
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
said
Eleanor
;
"
pray
<EOS>
do
not
 
pray
wait
till
I
see
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
home
in
a
day
or
two
,
and
then
I
will
explain
to
you
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
home
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
,
"
said
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
come
and
dine
with
me
,
and
then
we
shall
be
so
comfortable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
promised
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
exactly
know
what
there
was
to
be
explained
,
or
why
Dr.
Grantly
's
mind
should
not
be
disabused
of
the
mistake
into
which
he
had
fallen
,
but
nevertheless
he
promised
.
<EOS>
He
owed
some
reparation
to
his
daughter
,
and
he
thought
that
he
might
best
make
it
by
obedience
.
  
<EOS>
And
thus
the
people
were
thinning
off
by
degrees
as
Charlotte
and
Eleanor
walked
about
in
quest
of
Bertie
.
<EOS>
Their
search
might
have
been
long
had
they
not
happened
to
hear
his
voice
.
<EOS>
He
was
comfortably
ensconced
in
the
ha
-
ha
,
with
his
back
to
the
sloping
side
,
smoking
a
cigar
,
and
eagerly
engaged
in
conversation
with
some
youngster
from
the
further
side
of
the
county
,
whom
he
had
never
met
before
,
who
was
also
smoking
under
Bertie
's
pupilage
and
listening
with
open
ears
to
an
account
given
by
his
companion
of
some
of
the
pastimes
of
Eastern
clime
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bertie
,
I
am
seeking
you
everywhere
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
<EOS>
"
Come
up
here
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bertie
looked
up
out
of
the
ha
-
ha
and
saw
the
two
ladies
before
him
.
<EOS>
As
there
was
nothing
for
him
but
to
obey
,
he
got
up
and
threw
away
his
cigar
.
<EOS>
From
the
first
moment
of
his
acquaintance
with
her
<EOS>
he
had
liked
Eleanor
Bold
.
<EOS>
Had
he
been
left
to
his
own
devices
,
had
she
been
penniless
,
and
had
it
then
been
quite
out
of
the
question
that
he
should
marry
her
,
he
would
most
probably
have
fallen
violently
in
love
with
her
.
<EOS>
But
now
he
could
not
help
regarding
her
somewhat
as
he
did
the
marble
workshops
at
Carrara
,
as
he
had
done
his
easel
and
palette
,
as
he
had
done
the
lawyer
's
chambers
in
London
 
in
fact
,
as
he
had
invariably
regarded
everything
by
which
it
had
been
proposed
to
him
to
obtain
the
means
of
living
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
Bold
appeared
before
him
,
no
longer
as
a
beautiful
woman
,
but
as
a
new
profession
called
matrimony
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
profession
indeed
requiring
but
little
labour
,
and
one
in
which
an
income
was
insured
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
nevertheless
he
had
been
as
it
were
goaded
on
to
it
;
his
sister
had
talked
to
him
of
Eleanor
,
just
as
she
had
talked
of
busts
and
portraits
.
<EOS>
Bertie
did
not
dislike
money
,
but
he
hated
the
very
thought
of
earning
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
called
away
from
his
pleasant
cigar
to
earn
it
,
by
offering
himself
as
a
husband
to
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
The
work
indeed
was
made
easy
enough
,
for
in
lieu
of
his
having
to
seek
the
widow
,
the
widow
had
apparently
come
to
seek
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
made
some
sudden
absurd
excuse
to
his
auditor
and
then
,
throwing
away
his
cigar
,
climbed
up
the
wall
of
the
ha
-
ha
and
joined
the
ladies
on
the
lawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
and
give
Mrs.
Bold
an
arm
,
"
said
Charlotte
,
"
while
I
set
you
on
a
piece
of
duty
which
,
as
a
_
preux
chevalier
_
,
you
must
immediately
perform
.
<EOS>
Your
personal
danger
will
,
I
fear
,
be
insignificant
,
as
your
antagonist
is
a
clergyman
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bertie
immediately
gave
his
arm
to
Eleanor
,
walking
between
her
and
his
sister
.
<EOS>
He
had
lived
too
long
abroad
to
fall
into
the
Englishman
's
habit
of
offering
each
an
arm
to
two
ladies
at
the
same
time
 
a
habit
,
by
the
by
,
which
foreigners
regard
as
an
approach
to
bigamy
,
or
a
sort
of
incipient
Mormonism
.
  
<EOS>
The
little
history
of
Mr.
Slope
's
misconduct
was
then
told
to
Bertie
by
his
sister
,
Eleanor
's
ears
tingling
the
while
.
<EOS>
And
well
they
might
tingle
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
necessary
to
speak
of
the
outrage
at
all
,
why
should
it
be
spoken
of
to
such
a
person
as
Mr.
Stanhope
,
and
why
in
her
own
hearing
?
<EOS>
She
knew
she
was
wrong
,
and
was
unhappy
and
dispirited
,
yet
she
could
think
of
no
way
to
extricate
herself
,
no
way
to
set
herself
right
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
spared
her
as
much
as
she
possibly
could
,
spoke
of
the
whole
thing
as
though
Mr.
Slope
had
taken
a
glass
of
wine
too
much
,
said
that
of
course
there
would
be
nothing
more
about
it
,
but
that
steps
must
be
taken
to
exclude
Mr.
Slope
from
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Bold
need
be
under
no
alarm
about
that
,
"
said
Bertie
,
"
for
Mr.
Slope
has
gone
this
hour
past
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
that
business
made
it
necessary
that
he
should
start
at
once
for
Barchester
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
so
tipsy
,
at
any
rate
,
but
what
he
knows
his
fault
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
my
dear
,
that
is
one
difficulty
over
.
<EOS>
Now
I
'll
leave
you
with
your
true
knight
and
get
Madeline
off
as
quickly
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
The
carriage
is
here
,
I
suppose
,
Bertie
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
here
for
the
last
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
well
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
'll
come
in
to
tea
.
<EOS>
I
shall
trust
to
you
to
bring
her
,
Bertie
,
even
by
force
if
necessary
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
saying
,
Charlotte
ran
off
across
the
lawn
,
leaving
her
brother
alone
with
the
widow
.
  
<EOS>
As
Miss
Stanhope
went
off
,
Eleanor
bethought
herself
that
,
as
Mr.
Slope
had
taken
his
departure
,
there
no
longer
existed
any
necessity
for
separating
Mr.
Stanhope
from
his
sister
Madeline
,
who
so
much
needed
his
aid
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
arranged
that
he
should
remain
so
as
to
preoccupy
Mr.
Slope
's
place
in
the
carriage
,
and
act
as
a
social
policeman
to
effect
the
exclusion
of
that
disagreeable
gentleman
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Slope
had
effected
his
own
exclusion
,
and
there
was
no
possible
reason
now
why
Bertie
should
not
go
with
his
sister
 
<EOS>
at
least
Eleanor
saw
none
,
and
she
said
as
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
let
Charlotte
have
her
own
way
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
arranged
it
,
and
there
will
be
no
end
of
confusion
if
we
make
another
change
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
always
arranges
everything
in
our
house
and
rules
us
like
a
despot
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
the
signora
?
"
said
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
the
signora
can
do
very
well
without
me
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
will
have
to
do
without
me
,
"
he
added
,
thinking
rather
of
his
studies
in
Carrara
than
of
his
Barchester
hymeneals
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
are
not
going
to
leave
us
?
"
asked
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
It
has
been
said
that
Bertie
Stanhope
was
a
man
without
principle
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
was
so
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
power
of
using
active
mental
exertion
to
keep
himself
from
doing
evil
.
<EOS>
Evil
had
no
ugliness
in
his
eyes
;
virtue
no
beauty
.
<EOS>
He
was
void
of
any
of
these
feelings
which
actuate
men
to
do
good
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
perhaps
equally
void
of
those
which
actuate
men
to
do
evil
.
<EOS>
He
got
into
debt
with
utter
recklessness
,
thinking
nothing
as
to
whether
the
tradesmen
would
ever
be
paid
or
not
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
invent
active
schemes
of
deceit
for
the
sake
of
extracting
the
goods
of
others
.
<EOS>
If
a
man
gave
him
credit
,
that
was
the
man
's
look
-
out
;
Bertie
Stanhope
troubled
himself
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
In
borrowing
money
he
did
the
same
;
he
gave
people
references
to
"
his
governor
;
"
told
them
that
the
"
old
chap
"
had
a
good
income
;
and
agreed
to
pay
sixty
per
cent
for
the
accommodation
.
<EOS>
All
this
he
did
without
a
scruple
of
conscience
;
but
then
he
never
contrived
active
villainy
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
affair
of
his
marriage
it
had
been
represented
to
him
as
a
matter
of
duty
that
he
ought
to
put
himself
in
possession
of
Mrs.
Bold
's
hand
and
fortune
,
and
at
first
he
had
so
regarded
it
.
<EOS>
About
her
he
had
thought
but
little
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
customary
thing
for
men
situated
as
he
was
to
marry
for
money
,
and
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
do
what
others
around
him
did
.
<EOS>
And
so
he
consented
.
<EOS>
But
now
he
began
to
see
the
matter
in
another
light
.
<EOS>
He
was
setting
himself
down
to
catch
this
woman
,
as
a
cat
sits
to
catch
a
mouse
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
catch
her
,
and
swallow
her
up
,
her
and
her
child
,
and
her
houses
and
land
,
in
order
that
he
might
live
on
her
instead
of
on
his
father
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
cold
,
calculating
,
cautious
cunning
about
this
quite
at
variance
with
Bertie
's
character
.
<EOS>
The
prudence
of
the
measure
was
quite
as
antagonistic
to
his
feelings
as
the
iniquity
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
,
should
he
be
successful
<EOS>
,
what
would
be
the
reward
?
<EOS>
Having
satisfied
his
creditors
with
half
of
the
widow
's
fortune
,
he
would
be
allowed
to
sit
down
quietly
at
Barchester
,
keeping
economical
house
with
the
remainder
.
<EOS>
His
duty
would
be
to
rock
the
cradle
of
the
late
Mr.
Bold
's
child
,
and
his
highest
excitement
a
demure
party
at
Plumstead
Rectory
,
<EOS>
should
it
ultimately
turn
out
that
the
archdeacon
would
be
sufficiently
reconciled
to
receive
him
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
very
little
in
the
programme
to
allure
such
a
man
as
Bertie
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
Would
not
the
Carrara
workshop
,
or
whatever
worldly
career
fortune
might
have
in
store
for
him
,
would
not
almost
anything
be
better
than
this
?
<EOS>
The
lady
herself
was
undoubtedly
all
that
was
desirable
,
but
the
most
desirable
lady
becomes
nauseous
when
she
has
to
be
taken
as
a
pill
.
<EOS>
He
was
pledged
to
his
sister
,
however
,
and
let
him
quarrel
with
whom
he
would
,
it
behoved
him
not
to
quarrel
with
her
.
<EOS>
If
she
were
lost
to
him
,
all
would
be
lost
that
he
could
ever
hope
to
derive
henceforward
from
the
paternal
roof
-
tree
.
<EOS>
His
mother
was
apparently
indifferent
to
his
weal
or
woe
,
to
his
wants
or
his
warfare
.
<EOS>
His
father
's
brow
got
blacker
and
blacker
from
day
to
day
,
as
the
old
man
looked
at
his
hopeless
son
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
Madeline
 
poor
Madeline
,
whom
of
all
of
them
he
liked
the
best
 
<EOS>
she
had
enough
to
do
to
shift
for
herself
.
<EOS>
No
;
come
what
might
,
he
must
cling
to
his
sister
and
obey
her
behests
,
let
them
be
ever
<EOS>
so
stern
 
or
at
the
very
least
seem
to
obey
them
.
<EOS>
Could
not
some
happy
deceit
bring
him
through
in
this
matter
,
so
that
he
might
save
appearances
with
his
sister
and
yet
not
betray
the
widow
to
her
ruin
?
<EOS>
What
if
he
made
a
confederate
of
Eleanor
?
<EOS>
"
Twas
in
this
spirit
that
Bertie
Stanhope
set
about
his
wooing
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
not
going
to
leave
Barchester
?
"
asked
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
he
replied
;
"
I
hardly
know
yet
what
I
am
going
to
do
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
at
any
rate
certain
that
I
must
do
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
about
your
profession
?
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
about
my
profession
,
if
you
can
call
it
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
is
it
not
one
?
"
said
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
Were
I
a
man
<EOS>
,
I
know
none
I
should
prefer
to
it
,
except
painting
.
<EOS>
And
I
believe
the
one
is
as
much
in
your
power
as
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
just
about
equally
so
,
"
said
Bertie
with
a
little
touch
of
inward
satire
directed
at
himself
.
<EOS>
He
knew
in
his
heart
that
he
would
never
make
a
penny
by
either
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
wondered
,
Mr.
Stanhope
,
why
you
do
not
exert
yourself
more
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
who
felt
a
friendly
fondness
for
the
man
with
whom
she
was
walking
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
know
it
is
very
impertinent
in
me
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Impertinent
!
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
so
,
but
much
too
kind
.
<EOS>
It
is
much
too
kind
in
you
to
take
any
interest
in
so
idle
a
scamp
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
not
a
scamp
,
though
you
are
perhaps
idle
.
<EOS>
And
I
do
take
an
interest
in
you
,
a
very
great
interest
,
"
she
added
in
a
voice
which
almost
made
him
resolve
to
change
his
mind
.
"
<EOS>
And
when
I
call
you
idle
,
I
know
you
are
only
so
for
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
Why
ca
n't
you
settle
steadily
to
work
here
in
Barchester
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
make
busts
of
the
bishop
,
dean
,
and
chapter
?
<EOS>
Or
perhaps
,
if
I
achieve
a
great
success
,
obtain
a
commission
to
put
up
an
elaborate
tombstone
over
a
prebendary
's
widow
,
a
dead
lady
with
a
Grecian
nose
,
a
bandeau
,
and
an
intricate
lace
veil
;
lying
of
course
on
a
marble
sofa
from
among
the
legs
of
which
death
will
be
creeping
out
and
poking
at
his
victim
with
a
small
toasting
-
fork
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
laughed
,
but
<EOS>
yet
she
thought
that
if
the
surviving
prebendary
paid
the
bill
,
the
object
of
the
artist
as
a
professional
man
would
in
a
great
measure
be
obtained
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
about
the
dean
and
chapter
and
the
prebendary
's
widow
,
"
said
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
must
take
them
as
they
come
.
<EOS>
But
the
fact
of
your
having
a
great
cathedral
in
which
such
ornaments
are
required
could
not
but
be
in
your
favour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
real
artist
could
descend
to
the
ornamentation
of
a
cathedral
,
"
said
Bertie
,
who
had
his
ideas
of
the
high
ecstatic
ambition
of
art
,
as
indeed
all
artists
have
who
are
not
in
receipt
of
a
good
income
.
<EOS>
"
Buildings
should
be
fitted
to
grace
the
sculpture
,
not
the
sculpture
to
grace
the
building
.
"
  
"
Yes
,
when
the
work
of
art
is
good
enough
to
merit
it
.
<EOS>
Do
you
,
Mr.
Stanhope
,
do
something
sufficiently
excellent
and
we
ladies
of
Barchester
will
erect
for
it
a
fitting
receptacle
.
<EOS>
Come
,
what
shall
the
subject
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
put
you
in
your
pony
chair
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
as
Dannecker
put
Ariadne
on
her
lion
.
<EOS>
Only
you
must
promise
to
sit
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
ponies
are
too
tame
,
I
fear
,
and
my
broad
-
brimmed
straw
hat
will
not
look
so
well
in
marble
as
the
lace
veil
of
the
prebendary
's
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
not
consent
to
that
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
I
will
consent
to
try
no
other
subject
in
Barchester
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
determined
then
to
push
your
fortune
in
other
lands
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
determined
,
"
said
Bertie
slowly
and
significantly
,
as
he
tried
to
bring
up
his
mind
to
a
great
resolve
;
"
I
am
determined
in
this
matter
to
be
guided
wholly
by
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wholly
by
me
?
"
said
Eleanor
,
astonished
at
,
and
not
quite
liking
,
his
altered
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wholly
by
you
,
"
said
Bertie
,
dropping
his
companion
's
arm
and
standing
before
her
on
the
path
.
<EOS>
In
their
walk
they
had
come
exactly
to
the
spot
in
which
Eleanor
had
been
provoked
into
slapping
Mr.
Slope
's
face
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
that
this
place
was
peculiarly
unpropitious
to
her
comfort
?
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
that
she
should
here
have
to
encounter
yet
another
amorous
swain
?
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
be
guided
by
me
,
Mr.
Stanhope
,
you
will
set
yourself
down
to
steady
and
persevering
work
,
and
you
will
be
ruled
by
your
father
as
to
the
place
in
which
it
will
be
most
advisable
for
you
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
could
be
more
prudent
,
if
only
it
were
practicable
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
if
you
will
let
me
,
I
will
tell
you
how
it
is
that
I
will
be
guided
by
you
,
and
why
.
<EOS>
Will
you
let
me
tell
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
not
know
what
you
can
have
to
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
you
can
not
know
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
that
you
should
.
<EOS>
But
we
have
been
very
good
friends
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
have
we
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
think
we
have
,
"
said
she
,
observing
in
his
demeanour
an
earnestness
very
unusual
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
kind
enough
to
say
just
now
that
you
took
an
interest
in
me
,
and
I
was
perhaps
vain
enough
to
believe
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
vanity
in
that
;
I
do
so
as
your
sister
's
brother
 
<EOS>
and
as
my
own
friend
also
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
do
n't
deserve
that
you
should
feel
so
kindly
towards
me
,
"
said
Bertie
,
"
but
upon
my
word
I
am
very
grateful
for
it
,
"
and
he
paused
awhile
,
hardly
knowing
how
to
introduce
the
subject
that
he
had
in
hand
.
  
<EOS>
And
it
was
no
wonder
that
he
found
it
difficult
.
<EOS>
He
had
to
make
known
to
his
companion
the
scheme
that
had
been
prepared
to
rob
her
of
her
wealth
,
he
had
to
tell
her
that
he
had
intended
to
marry
her
without
loving
her
,
or
else
that
he
loved
her
without
intending
to
marry
her
;
and
he
had
also
to
bespeak
from
her
not
only
his
own
pardon
,
but
also
that
of
his
sister
,
and
induce
Mrs.
Bold
to
protest
in
her
future
communion
with
Charlotte
that
an
offer
had
been
duly
made
to
her
and
duly
rejected
.
  
<EOS>
Bertie
Stanhope
was
not
prone
to
be
very
diffident
of
his
own
conversational
powers
,
but
it
did
seem
to
him
that
he
was
about
to
tax
them
almost
too
far
.
<EOS>
He
hardly
knew
where
to
begin
,
and
he
hardly
knew
where
he
should
end
.
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
Eleanor
was
again
walking
on
slowly
by
his
side
,
not
taking
his
arm
as
she
had
heretofore
done
but
listening
very
intently
for
whatever
Bertie
might
have
to
say
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
be
guided
by
you
,
"
said
he
;
"
indeed
,
in
this
matter
there
is
no
one
else
who
can
set
me
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
must
be
nonsense
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
listen
to
me
now
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
and
if
you
can
help
it
,
pray
do
n't
be
angry
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Angry
!
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
indeed
you
will
have
cause
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
very
much
attached
to
you
my
sister
Charlotte
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
acknowledged
that
she
did
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
she
is
;
I
never
knew
her
to
love
anyone
so
warmly
on
so
short
an
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
You
know
also
how
well
she
loves
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
now
made
no
answer
,
but
she
felt
the
blood
tingle
in
her
cheek
as
she
gathered
from
what
he
said
the
probable
result
of
this
double
-
barrelled
love
on
the
part
of
Miss
Stanhope
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
her
only
brother
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
and
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
she
should
love
me
.
<EOS>
But
you
do
not
yet
know
Charlotte
 
<EOS>
you
do
not
know
how
entirely
the
well
-
being
of
our
family
hangs
on
her
.
<EOS>
Without
her
to
manage
for
us
,
I
do
not
know
how
we
should
get
on
from
day
to
day
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
yet
have
observed
all
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
had
indeed
observed
a
good
deal
of
this
;
she
did
not
,
however
,
now
say
so
,
but
allowed
him
to
proceed
with
his
story
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
therefore
be
surprised
that
Charlotte
should
be
most
anxious
to
do
the
best
for
us
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
said
that
she
was
not
at
all
surprised
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
she
has
had
a
very
difficult
game
to
play
,
Mrs.
Bold
 
a
very
difficult
game
.
<EOS>
Poor
Madeline
's
unfortunate
marriage
and
terrible
accident
,
my
mother
's
ill
-
health
<EOS>
,
my
father
's
absence
from
England
,
and
last
,
and
worse
perhaps
,
my
own
roving
,
idle
spirit
have
almost
been
too
much
for
her
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
wonder
if
among
all
her
cares
one
of
the
foremost
is
to
see
me
settled
in
the
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
on
this
occasion
expressed
no
acquiescence
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
supposed
that
a
formal
offer
was
to
be
made
and
could
not
but
think
that
so
singular
<EOS>
an
exordium
was
never
before
made
by
a
gentleman
in
a
similar
position
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
annoyed
her
by
the
excess
of
his
ardour
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
clear
that
no
such
danger
was
to
be
feared
from
Mr.
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
Prudential
motives
alone
actuated
him
.
<EOS>
Not
only
was
he
about
to
make
love
because
his
sister
told
him
,
but
he
also
took
the
precaution
of
explaining
all
this
before
he
began
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twas
thus
,
we
may
presume
,
that
the
matter
presented
itself
to
Mrs.
Bold
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
got
so
far
,
Bertie
began
poking
the
gravel
with
a
little
cane
which
he
carried
.
<EOS>
He
still
kept
moving
on
,
but
very
slowly
,
and
his
companion
moved
slowly
by
his
side
,
not
inclined
to
assist
him
in
the
task
the
performance
of
which
appeared
to
be
difficult
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Knowing
how
fond
she
is
of
yourself
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
can
not
you
imagine
what
scheme
should
have
occurred
to
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
imagine
no
better
scheme
,
Mr.
Stanhope
,
than
the
one
I
proposed
to
you
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
he
somewhat
lackadaisically
;
"
I
suppose
that
would
be
the
best
,
but
Charlotte
thinks
another
plan
might
be
joined
with
it
.
<EOS>
She
wants
me
to
marry
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
thousand
remembrances
flashed
across
Eleanor
's
mind
all
in
a
moment
 
<EOS>
how
Charlotte
had
talked
about
and
praised
her
brother
,
how
she
had
continually
contrived
to
throw
the
two
of
them
together
,
how
she
had
encouraged
all
manner
of
little
intimacies
,
how
she
had
with
singular
cordiality
persisted
in
treating
Eleanor
as
one
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
All
this
had
been
done
to
secure
her
comfortable
income
for
the
benefit
of
one
of
the
family
!
  
<EOS>
Such
a
feeling
as
this
is
very
bitter
when
it
first
impresses
itself
on
a
young
mind
.
<EOS>
To
the
old
,
such
plots
and
plans
,
such
matured
schemes
for
obtaining
the
goods
of
this
world
without
the
trouble
of
earning
them
,
such
long
-
headed
attempts
to
convert
"
tuum
"
into
"
meum
"
are
the
ways
of
life
to
which
they
are
accustomed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tis
thus
that
many
live
,
and
it
therefore
behoves
all
those
who
are
well
-
to
-
do
in
the
world
to
be
on
their
guard
against
those
who
are
not
.
<EOS>
With
them
it
is
the
success
that
disgusts
,
not
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
But
Eleanor
had
not
yet
learnt
to
look
on
her
money
as
a
source
of
danger
;
she
had
not
begun
to
regard
herself
as
fair
game
to
be
hunted
down
by
hungry
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
She
had
enjoyed
the
society
of
the
Stanhopes
,
she
had
greatly
liked
the
cordiality
of
Charlotte
,
and
had
been
happy
in
her
new
friends
.
<EOS>
Now
she
saw
the
cause
of
all
this
kindness
,
and
her
mind
was
opened
to
a
new
phase
of
human
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Stanhope
,
"
said
she
haughtily
,
"
has
been
contriving
for
me
a
great
deal
of
honour
,
but
she
might
have
saved
herself
the
trouble
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
sufficiently
ambitious
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
be
angry
with
her
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
"
said
he
,
"
or
with
me
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
not
with
you
,
Mr.
Stanhope
,
"
said
she
with
considerable
sarcasm
in
her
tone
.
"
<EOS>
Certainly
not
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
 
nor
with
her
,
"
said
he
imploringly
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
,
may
I
ask
you
,
Mr.
Stanhope
,
have
you
told
me
this
singular
story
?
<EOS>
For
I
may
presume
I
may
judge
by
your
manner
of
telling
it
that
 
that
 
that
you
and
your
sister
are
not
exactly
of
one
mind
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
we
are
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
so
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bold
,
who
was
now
really
angry
with
the
unnecessary
insult
which
she
thought
had
been
offered
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
if
so
,
why
has
it
been
worth
your
while
to
tell
me
all
this
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
once
think
,
Mrs.
Bold
 
that
you
 
that
you
 
"
  
<EOS>
The
widow
now
again
became
entirely
impassive
,
and
would
not
lend
the
slightest
assistance
to
her
companion
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
once
think
that
you
perhaps
might
 
might
have
been
taught
to
regard
me
as
more
than
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
!
"
said
Mrs.
Bold
,
"
never
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
ever
allowed
myself
to
do
anything
to
encourage
such
an
idea
,
I
have
been
very
much
to
blame
 
very
much
to
blame
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
have
,
"
said
Bertie
,
who
really
had
a
good
-
natured
anxiety
to
make
what
he
said
as
little
unpleasant
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
You
never
have
,
and
I
have
seen
for
some
time
that
I
had
no
chance
 
<EOS>
but
my
sister
's
hopes
ran
higher
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
mistaken
you
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
though
perhaps
she
has
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
have
you
said
all
this
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
must
not
anger
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
will
not
this
anger
her
?
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
Mr.
Stanhope
,
I
do
not
understand
the
policy
of
your
family
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
I
wish
I
was
at
home
!
"
<EOS>
And
as
she
expressed
the
wish
she
could
restrain
herself
no
longer
and
burst
out
into
a
flood
of
tears
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Bertie
was
greatly
moved
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
the
carriage
to
yourself
going
home
,
"
said
he
;
"
at
least
you
and
my
father
.
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
I
can
walk
,
or
for
the
matter
of
that
it
does
not
much
signify
what
I
do
.
"
<EOS>
He
perfectly
understood
that
part
of
Eleanor
's
grief
arose
from
the
apparent
necessity
of
her
going
back
to
Barchester
in
the
carriage
with
her
second
suitor
.
  
<EOS>
This
somewhat
mollified
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mr.
Stanhope
,
"
said
she
,
"
why
should
you
have
made
me
so
miserable
?
<EOS>
What
will
you
have
gained
by
telling
me
all
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
even
yet
explained
to
her
the
most
difficult
part
of
his
proposition
;
he
had
not
told
her
that
she
was
to
be
a
party
to
the
little
deception
which
he
intended
to
play
off
upon
his
sister
.
<EOS>
This
suggestion
had
still
to
be
made
,
and
as
it
was
absolutely
necessary
,
he
proceeded
to
make
it
.
  
<EOS>
We
need
not
follow
him
through
the
whole
of
his
statement
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
and
not
without
considerable
difficulty
,
he
made
Eleanor
understand
why
he
had
let
her
into
his
confidence
,
seeing
that
he
no
longer
intended
her
the
honour
of
a
formal
offer
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
made
her
comprehend
the
part
which
she
was
destined
to
play
in
this
little
family
comedy
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
she
did
understand
it
,
she
was
only
more
angry
with
him
than
ever
;
more
angry
,
not
only
with
him
,
but
with
Charlotte
also
.
<EOS>
Her
fair
name
was
to
be
bandied
about
between
them
in
different
senses
,
and
each
sense
false
.
<EOS>
She
was
to
be
played
off
by
the
sister
against
the
father
,
and
then
by
the
brother
against
the
sister
.
<EOS>
Her
dear
friend
Charlotte
,
with
all
her
agreeable
sympathy
and
affection
,
was
striving
to
sacrifice
her
for
the
Stanhope
family
welfare
;
and
Bertie
,
who
,
as
he
now
proclaimed
himself
,
was
over
head
and
ears
in
debt
,
completed
the
compliment
of
owning
that
he
did
not
care
to
have
his
debts
paid
at
so
great
a
sacrifice
of
himself
.
<EOS>
Then
she
was
asked
to
conspire
together
with
this
unwilling
suitor
for
the
sake
of
making
the
family
believe
that
he
had
in
obedience
to
their
commands
done
his
best
to
throw
himself
thus
away
!
  
<EOS>
She
lifted
up
her
face
when
he
had
finished
,
and
looking
at
him
with
much
dignity
,
even
through
her
tears
,
she
said
:
  
"
I
regret
to
say
it
,
Mr.
Stanhope
,
but
after
what
has
passed
I
believe
that
all
intercourse
between
your
family
and
myself
had
better
cease
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
perhaps
it
had
,
"
said
Bertie
naïvely
;
"
perhaps
that
will
be
better
at
any
rate
for
a
time
;
and
then
Charlotte
will
think
you
are
offended
at
what
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
I
will
go
back
to
the
house
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
find
my
way
by
myself
,
Mr.
Stanhope
:
after
what
has
passed
,
"
she
added
,
"
I
would
rather
go
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
find
the
carriage
for
you
,
Mrs.
Bold
;
and
I
must
tell
my
father
that
you
will
return
with
him
alone
;
and
I
must
make
some
excuse
to
him
for
not
going
with
you
;
and
I
must
bid
the
servant
put
you
down
at
your
own
house
,
for
I
suppose
you
will
not
now
choose
to
see
them
again
in
the
close
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
truth
about
this
,
and
a
perspicuity
in
making
arrangements
for
lessening
her
immediate
embarrassment
,
which
had
some
effect
in
softening
Eleanor
's
anger
.
<EOS>
So
she
suffered
herself
to
walk
by
his
side
over
the
now
deserted
lawn
,
till
they
came
to
the
drawing
-
room
window
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
about
Bertie
Stanhope
which
gave
him
,
in
the
estimation
of
everyone
,
a
different
standing
from
that
which
any
other
man
would
occupy
under
similar
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Angry
as
Eleanor
was
,
and
great
as
was
her
cause
for
anger
,
she
was
not
half
as
angry
with
him
as
she
would
have
been
with
anyone
else
.
<EOS>
He
was
apparently
so
simple
,
so
good
-
natured
,
so
unaffected
and
easy
to
talk
to
,
<EOS>
that
she
had
already
half
-
forgiven
him
before
he
was
at
the
drawing
-
room
window
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
arrived
there
,
Dr.
Stanhope
was
sitting
nearly
alone
with
Mr.
and
Miss
Thorne
;
one
or
two
other
unfortunates
were
there
,
who
from
one
cause
or
another
were
still
delayed
in
getting
away
,
but
they
were
every
moment
getting
fewer
in
number
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
had
handed
Eleanor
over
to
his
father
,
Bertie
started
off
to
the
front
gate
in
search
of
the
carriage
,
and
there
he
waited
leaning
patiently
against
the
front
wall
,
comfortably
smoking
a
cigar
,
till
it
came
up
.
<EOS>
When
he
returned
to
the
room
,
Dr.
Stanhope
and
Eleanor
were
alone
with
their
hosts
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
last
,
Miss
Thorne
,
"
said
he
cheerily
,
"
I
have
come
to
relieve
you
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
and
my
father
are
the
last
roses
of
the
very
delightful
summer
you
have
given
us
,
and
desirable
as
Mrs.
Bold
's
society
always
is
,
now
at
least
you
must
be
glad
to
see
the
last
flowers
plucked
from
the
tree
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
declared
that
she
was
delighted
to
have
Mrs.
Bold
and
Dr.
Stanhope
still
with
her
,
and
Mr.
Thorne
would
have
said
the
same
,
had
he
not
been
checked
by
a
yawn
,
which
he
could
not
suppress
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
,
will
you
give
your
arm
to
Mrs.
Bold
?
"
said
Bertie
:
<EOS>
and
so
the
last
adieux
were
made
,
and
the
prebendary
led
out
Mrs.
Bold
,
followed
by
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
home
soon
after
you
,
"
said
he
as
the
two
got
into
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
not
coming
in
the
carriage
?
"
said
the
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
I
have
someone
to
see
on
the
road
,
and
shall
walk
.
<EOS>
John
,
mind
you
drive
to
Mrs.
Bold
's
house
first
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
looking
out
of
the
window
,
saw
him
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
bowing
to
her
with
his
usual
gay
smile
,
as
though
nothing
had
happened
to
mar
the
tranquillity
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
It
was
many
a
long
year
before
she
saw
him
again
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Stanhope
hardly
spoke
to
her
on
her
way
home
,
and
she
was
safely
deposited
by
John
at
her
own
hall
-
door
before
the
carriage
drove
into
the
close
.
  
<EOS>
And
thus
our
heroine
played
the
last
act
of
that
day
's
melodrama
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.

Mrs.
Quiverful

Before
she
started
for
Ullathorne
,
Mrs.
Proudie
,
careful
soul
,
caused
two
letters
to
be
written
,
one
by
herself
and
one
by
her
lord
,
to
the
inhabitants
of
Puddingdale
vicarage
,
which
made
happy
the
hearth
of
those
within
it
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
departure
of
the
horses
left
the
bishop
's
stable
-
groom
free
for
other
services
,
that
humble
denizen
of
the
diocese
started
on
the
bishop
's
own
pony
with
the
two
dispatches
.
<EOS>
We
have
had
so
many
letters
lately
that
we
will
spare
ourselves
these
.
<EOS>
That
from
the
bishop
was
simply
a
request
that
Mr.
Quiverful
would
wait
upon
his
lordship
the
next
morning
at
11
A.M.
;
that
from
the
lady
was
as
simply
a
request
that
Mrs.
Quiverful
would
do
the
same
by
her
,
though
it
was
couched
in
somewhat
longer
and
more
grandiloquent
phraseology
.
  
<EOS>
It
had
become
a
point
of
conscience
with
Mrs.
Proudie
to
urge
the
settlement
of
this
great
hospital
question
.
<EOS>
She
was
resolved
that
Mr.
Quiverful
should
have
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
resolved
that
there
should
be
no
more
doubt
or
delay
,
no
more
refusals
and
resignations
,
no
more
secret
negotiations
carried
on
by
Mr.
Slope
on
his
own
account
in
opposition
to
her
behests
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bishop
,
"
she
said
immediately
after
breakfast
on
the
morning
of
that
eventful
day
,
"
have
you
signed
the
appointment
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
,
not
yet
;
it
is
not
exactly
signed
as
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Then
do
it
,
"
said
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
did
it
,
and
a
very
pleasant
day
indeed
he
spent
at
Ullathorne
.
<EOS>
And
when
he
got
home
,
he
had
a
glass
of
hot
negus
in
his
wife
's
sitting
-
room
,
and
read
the
last
number
of
the
Little
Dorrit
of
the
day
with
great
inward
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
husbands
,
oh
,
my
marital
friends
,
what
great
comfort
is
there
to
be
derived
from
a
wife
well
obeyed
!
  
<EOS>
Much
perturbation
and
flutter
,
high
expectation
and
renewed
hopes
,
were
occasioned
at
Puddingdale
,
by
the
receipt
of
these
episcopal
dispatches
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
whose
careful
ear
caught
the
sound
of
the
pony
's
feet
as
he
trotted
up
to
the
vicarage
kitchen
door
,
brought
them
in
hurriedly
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
was
at
the
moment
concocting
the
Irish
stew
destined
to
satisfy
the
noonday
<EOS>
wants
of
fourteen
young
birds
,
let
alone
the
parent
couple
.
<EOS>
She
had
taken
the
letters
from
the
man
's
hands
between
the
folds
of
her
capacious
apron
so
as
to
save
them
from
the
contamination
of
the
stew
,
and
in
this
guise
she
brought
them
to
her
husband
's
desk
.
  
<EOS>
They
at
once
divided
the
spoil
,
each
taking
that
addressed
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quiverful
,
"
said
she
with
impressive
voice
,
"
you
are
to
be
at
the
palace
at
eleven
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
so
are
you
,
my
dear
,
"
said
he
,
almost
gasping
with
the
importance
of
the
tidings
 
<EOS>
and
then
they
exchanged
letters
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
'd
never
have
sent
for
me
again
,
"
said
the
lady
,
"
if
it
was
n't
all
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
,
do
n't
be
too
certain
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
"
Only
think
if
it
should
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
'd
never
have
sent
for
me
,
Q.
,
if
it
was
n't
all
right
,
"
again
argued
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
stiff
and
hard
and
proud
as
piecrust
,
but
I
think
she
's
right
at
bottom
.
<EOS>
"
Such
was
Mrs.
Quiverful
's
verdict
about
Mrs.
Proudie
,
to
which
in
after
times
she
always
adhered
.
<EOS>
People
when
they
get
their
income
doubled
usually
think
that
those
through
whose
instrumentality
this
little
ceremony
is
performed
are
right
at
bottom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Letty
!
"
said
Mr.
Quiverful
,
rising
from
his
well
-
worn
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Q.
!
"
said
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
and
then
the
two
,
unmindful
of
the
kitchen
apron
,
the
greasy
fingers
,
and
the
adherent
Irish
stew
,
threw
themselves
warmly
into
each
other
's
arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
heaven
's
sake
,
do
n't
let
anyone
cajole
you
out
of
it
again
,
"
said
the
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
alone
for
that
,
"
said
the
husband
with
a
look
of
almost
fierce
determination
,
pressing
his
fist
as
he
spoke
rigidly
on
his
desk
,
as
though
he
had
Mr.
Slope
's
head
below
his
knuckles
and
meant
to
keep
it
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
how
soon
it
will
be
?
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
it
will
be
at
all
?
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
still
doubtful
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
wo
n't
say
too
much
,
"
said
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
cup
has
slipped
twice
before
,
and
it
may
fall
altogether
this
time
,
but
I
'll
not
believe
it
.
<EOS>
He
'll
give
you
the
appointment
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
You
'll
find
he
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Heaven
send
he
may
,
"
said
Mr.
Quiverful
solemnly
.
<EOS>
And
who
that
considers
the
weight
of
the
burden
on
this
man
's
back
will
say
that
the
prayer
was
an
improper
one
?
<EOS>
There
were
fourteen
of
them
 
<EOS>
fourteen
of
them
living
 
as
Mrs.
Quiverful
had
so
powerfully
urged
in
the
presence
of
the
bishop
's
wife
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
promotion
cometh
from
any
human
source
,
whether
north
or
south
,
east
or
west
,
will
not
such
a
claim
as
this
hold
good
,
in
spite
of
all
our
examination
tests
,
_
detur
digniori
's
_
,
and
optimist
tendencies
?
<EOS>
It
is
fervently
to
be
hoped
that
it
may
.
<EOS>
Till
we
can
become
divine
,
we
must
be
content
to
be
human
,
lest
in
our
hurry
for
a
change
we
sink
to
something
lower
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
the
pair
,
sitting
down
lovingly
together
,
talked
over
all
their
difficulties
,
as
they
so
often
did
,
and
<EOS>
all
their
hopes
,
as
they
so
seldom
were
enabled
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
call
on
that
man
,
Q.
,
as
you
come
away
from
the
palace
,
"
said
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
pointing
to
an
angry
call
for
money
from
the
Barchester
draper
,
which
the
postman
had
left
at
the
vicarage
that
morning
.
<EOS>
Cormorant
that
he
was
,
unjust
,
hungry
cormorant
!
<EOS>
When
rumour
first
got
abroad
that
the
Quiverfuls
were
to
go
to
the
hospital
,
this
fellow
with
fawning
eagerness
had
pressed
his
goods
upon
the
wants
of
the
poor
clergyman
.
<EOS>
He
had
done
so
,
feeling
that
he
should
be
paid
from
the
hospital
funds
,
and
flattering
himself
that
a
man
with
fourteen
children
,
and
money
wherewithal
to
clothe
them
,
could
not
but
be
an
excellent
customer
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
second
rumour
reached
him
,
he
applied
for
his
money
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
And
"
the
fourteen
"
 
or
such
of
them
as
were
old
enough
to
hope
and
discuss
their
hopes
 
<EOS>
talked
over
their
golden
future
.
<EOS>
The
tall
grown
girls
whispered
to
each
other
of
possible
Barchester
parties
,
of
possible
allowances
for
dress
,
of
a
possible
piano
 
the
one
they
had
in
the
vicarage
was
so
weather
-
beaten
with
the
storms
of
years
and
children
as
to
be
no
longer
worthy
of
the
name
 
of
the
pretty
garden
,
and
the
pretty
house
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twas
of
such
things
it
most
behoved
them
to
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
And
the
younger
fry
,
they
did
not
content
themselves
with
whispers
,
but
shouted
to
each
other
of
their
new
playground
beneath
our
dear
ex
-
warden
's
well
-
loved
elms
,
of
their
future
own
gardens
,
of
marbles
to
be
procured
in
the
wished
-
for
city
,
and
of
the
rumour
which
had
reached
them
of
a
Barchester
school
.
  
<EOS>
"
Twas
in
vain
that
their
cautious
mother
tried
to
instil
into
their
breasts
the
very
feeling
she
had
striven
to
banish
from
that
of
their
father
;
"
twas
in
vain
that
she
repeated
to
the
girls
that
"
there
's
many
a
slip
"
<EOS>
twixt
the
cup
and
the
lip
;
"
"
twas
in
vain
she
attempted
to
make
the
children
believe
that
they
were
to
live
at
Puddingdale
all
their
lives
.
<EOS>
Hopes
mounted
high
,
and
would
not
have
themselves
quelled
.
<EOS>
The
neighbouring
farmers
heard
the
news
and
came
in
to
congratulate
them
.
"
<EOS>
Twas
Mrs.
Quiverful
herself
who
had
kindled
the
fire
,
and
in
the
first
outbreak
of
her
renewed
expectations
she
did
it
so
thoroughly
that
it
was
quite
past
her
power
to
put
it
out
again
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
matron
!
<EOS>
Good
,
honest
matron
,
doing
thy
duty
in
the
state
to
which
thou
hast
been
called
,
heartily
if
not
contentedly
;
let
the
fire
burn
on
;
on
this
occasion
the
flames
will
not
scorch
;
they
shall
warm
thee
and
thine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tis
ordained
that
that
husband
of
thine
,
that
Q.
of
thy
bosom
,
shall
reign
supreme
for
years
to
come
over
the
bedesmen
of
Hiram
's
Hospital
.
  
<EOS>
And
the
last
in
all
Barchester
to
mar
their
hopes
,
had
he
heard
and
seen
all
that
passed
at
Puddingdale
that
day
,
<EOS>
would
have
been
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
What
wants
had
he
to
set
in
opposition
to
those
of
such
a
regiment
of
young
ravens
?
<EOS>
There
are
fourteen
of
them
living
!
<EOS>
With
him
,
at
any
rate
,
let
us
say
that
that
argument
would
have
been
sufficient
for
the
appointment
of
Mr.
Quiverful
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
morning
Q.
and
his
wife
kept
their
appointments
with
that
punctuality
which
bespeaks
an
expectant
mind
.
<EOS>
The
friendly
farmer
's
gig
was
borrowed
,
and
in
that
they
went
,
discussing
many
things
by
the
way
.
<EOS>
They
had
instructed
the
household
to
expect
them
back
by
one
,
and
injunctions
were
given
to
the
eldest
pledge
to
have
ready
by
that
accustomed
hour
the
remainder
of
the
huge
stew
which
the
provident
mother
had
prepared
on
the
previous
day
.
<EOS>
The
hands
of
the
kitchen
clock
came
round
to
two
,
three
,
four
,
before
the
farmer
's
gig
wheels
were
again
heard
at
the
vicarage
gate
.
<EOS>
With
what
palpitating
hearts
were
the
returning
wanderers
greeted
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
children
,
you
all
thought
we
were
never
coming
back
any
more
?
"
said
the
mother
as
she
slowly
let
down
her
solid
foot
till
it
rested
on
the
step
of
the
gig
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
such
a
day
as
we
've
had
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
leaning
heavily
on
a
big
boy
's
shoulder
,
she
stepped
once
more
on
terra
firma
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
need
for
more
than
the
tone
of
her
voice
to
tell
them
that
all
was
right
.
<EOS>
The
Irish
stew
might
burn
itself
to
cinders
now
.
  
<EOS>
Then
there
was
such
kissing
and
hugging
,
such
crying
and
laughing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
could
not
sit
still
at
all
,
but
kept
walking
from
room
to
room
,
then
out
into
the
garden
,
then
down
the
avenue
into
the
road
,
and
then
back
again
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
She
,
however
,
lost
no
time
so
idly
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
go
to
work
at
once
,
girls
,
and
that
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
expects
us
to
be
in
the
hospital
house
on
the
15th
of
October
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Had
Mrs.
Proudie
expressed
a
wish
that
they
should
all
be
there
on
the
next
morning
,
the
girls
would
have
had
nothing
to
say
against
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
will
the
pay
begin
?
"
asked
the
eldest
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
-
day
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
gratified
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
is
jolly
,
"
said
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Proudie
insisted
on
our
going
down
to
the
house
,
"
continued
the
mother
,
"
and
when
there
,
I
thought
I
might
save
a
journey
by
measuring
some
of
the
rooms
and
windows
;
so
I
got
a
knot
of
tape
from
Bobbins
.
<EOS>
Bobbins
is
as
civil
as
you
please
,
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
thank
him
,
"
said
Letty
the
younger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
the
way
of
the
world
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
They
all
do
just
the
same
.
<EOS>
You
might
just
as
well
be
angry
with
the
turkey
cock
for
gobbling
at
you
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
bird
's
nature
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
she
enunciated
to
her
bairns
the
upshot
of
her
practical
experience
,
she
pulled
from
her
pocket
the
portions
of
tape
which
showed
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
various
rooms
at
the
hospital
house
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
we
will
leave
her
happy
in
her
toils
.
  
<EOS>
The
Quiverfuls
had
hardly
left
the
palace
,
and
Mrs.
Proudie
was
still
holding
forth
on
the
matter
to
her
husband
,
when
another
visitor
was
announced
in
the
person
of
Dr.
Gwynne
.
<EOS>
The
Master
of
Lazarus
had
asked
for
the
bishop
and
not
for
Mrs.
Proudie
,
and
therefore
when
he
was
shown
into
the
study
,
he
was
surprised
rather
than
rejoiced
to
find
the
lady
there
.
  
<EOS>
But
we
must
go
back
a
little
,
and
it
shall
be
<EOS>
but
a
little
,
for
a
difficulty
begins
to
make
itself
manifest
in
the
necessity
of
disposing
of
all
our
friends
in
the
small
remainder
of
this
one
volume
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
Mr.
Longman
would
allow
me
a
fourth
!
<EOS>
It
should
transcend
the
other
three
as
the
seventh
heaven
transcends
all
the
lower
stages
of
celestial
bliss
.
  
<EOS>
Going
home
in
the
carriage
that
evening
from
Ullathorne
,
Dr.
Gwynne
had
not
without
difficulty
brought
round
his
friend
the
archdeacon
to
a
line
of
tactics
much
less
bellicose
than
that
which
his
own
taste
would
have
preferred
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
unseemly
in
us
to
show
ourselves
in
a
bad
humour
;
moreover
,
we
have
no
power
in
this
matter
,
and
it
will
therefore
be
bad
policy
to
act
as
though
we
had
.
"
<EOS>
"
Twas
thus
the
Master
of
Lazarus
argued
.
<EOS>
"
If
,
"
he
continued
,
"
the
bishop
be
determined
to
appoint
another
to
the
hospital
,
threats
will
not
prevent
him
,
and
threats
should
not
be
lightly
used
by
an
archdeacon
to
his
bishop
.
<EOS>
If
he
will
place
a
stranger
in
the
hospital
,
we
can
only
leave
him
to
the
indignation
of
others
.
<EOS>
It
is
probable
that
such
a
step
may
not
eventually
injure
your
father
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
I
will
see
the
bishop
,
if
you
will
allow
me
 
alone
.
<EOS>
"
At
this
the
archdeacon
winced
visibly
.
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
alone
;
for
so
I
shall
be
calmer
;
and
then
I
shall
at
any
rate
learn
what
he
does
mean
to
do
in
the
matter
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
puffed
and
blew
,
put
up
the
carriage
window
and
then
put
it
down
again
,
argued
the
matter
up
to
his
own
gate
,
and
at
last
gave
way
.
<EOS>
Everybody
was
against
him
,
his
own
wife
,
Mr.
Harding
,
and
Dr.
Gwynne
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
keep
him
out
of
hot
water
,
Dr.
Gwynne
,
"
Mrs.
Grantly
had
said
to
her
guest
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
madam
,
I
'll
do
my
best
,
"
the
courteous
master
had
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twas
thus
he
did
it
and
earned
for
himself
the
gratitude
of
Mrs.
Grantly
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
we
may
return
to
the
bishop
's
study
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
had
certainly
not
foreseen
the
difficulty
which
here
presented
itself
.
<EOS>
He
 
together
with
all
the
clerical
world
of
England
 
had
heard
it
rumoured
about
that
Mrs.
Proudie
did
not
confine
herself
to
her
wardrobes
,
still
-
rooms
,
and
laundries
;
but
yet
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
if
he
called
on
a
bishop
at
one
o'clock
in
the
day
,
he
could
by
any
possibility
find
him
closeted
with
his
wife
;
or
that
if
he
did
so
,
the
wife
would
remain
longer
than
necessary
to
make
her
curtsey
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
,
however
,
as
though
in
the
present
case
Mrs.
Proudie
had
no
idea
of
retreating
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
had
been
very
much
pleased
with
Dr.
Gwynne
on
the
preceding
day
,
and
of
course
thought
that
Dr.
Gwynne
had
been
as
much
pleased
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
attributed
the
visit
solely
to
compliment
,
and
thought
it
an
extremely
gracious
and
proper
thing
for
the
Master
of
Lazarus
to
drive
over
from
Plumstead
specially
to
call
at
the
palace
so
soon
after
his
arrival
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
The
fact
that
they
were
not
on
the
same
side
either
in
politics
or
doctrines
made
the
compliment
the
greater
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
,
therefore
,
was
all
smiles
.
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Proudie
,
who
liked
people
with
good
handles
to
their
names
,
was
also
very
well
disposed
to
welcome
the
Master
of
Lazarus
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
had
a
charming
party
at
Ullathorne
,
Master
,
had
we
not
?
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
Mrs.
Grantly
got
home
without
fatigue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
said
that
they
had
all
been
a
little
tired
,
but
were
none
the
worse
this
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
An
excellent
person
,
Miss
Thorne
,
"
suggested
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
an
exemplary
Christian
<EOS>
,
I
am
told
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
declared
that
he
was
very
glad
to
hear
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
seen
her
Sabbath
-
day
schools
yet
,
"
continued
the
lady
,
"
but
I
shall
make
a
point
of
doing
so
before
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
merely
bowed
at
this
intimation
.
<EOS>
He
had
heard
something
of
Mrs.
Proudie
and
her
Sunday
-
schools
,
both
from
Dr.
Grantly
and
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
the
by
,
Master
,
"
continued
the
lady
,
"
I
wonder
whether
Mrs.
Grantly
would
like
me
to
drive
over
and
inspect
her
Sabbath
-
day
school
.
<EOS>
I
hear
that
it
is
most
excellently
kept
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
really
could
not
say
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
doubt
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
would
be
most
happy
to
see
Mrs.
Proudie
any
day
Mrs.
Proudie
would
do
her
the
honour
of
calling
:
that
was
,
of
course
,
if
Mrs.
Grantly
should
happen
to
be
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
A
slight
cloud
darkened
the
lady
's
brow
.
<EOS>
She
saw
that
her
offer
was
not
taken
in
good
part
.
<EOS>
This
generation
of
unregenerated
vipers
was
still
perverse
,
stiff
-
necked
,
and
hardened
in
their
iniquity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
,
I
know
,
"
said
she
,
"
sets
his
face
against
these
institutions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
Dr.
Gwynne
laughed
slightly
.
<EOS>
It
was
but
a
smile
.
<EOS>
Had
he
given
his
cap
for
it
<EOS>
he
could
not
have
helped
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
frowned
again
.
"
<EOS>
"
Suffer
little
children
,
and
forbid
them
not
,
"
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Are
we
not
to
remember
that
,
Dr.
Gwynne
?
<EOS>
"
Take
heed
that
ye
despise
not
one
of
these
little
ones
.
<EOS>
"
Are
we
not
to
remember
that
,
Dr.
Gwynne
?
"
<EOS>
And
at
each
of
these
questions
she
raised
at
him
her
menacing
forefinger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
madam
,
certainly
,
"
said
the
master
,
"
and
so
does
the
archdeacon
,
I
am
sure
,
on
weekdays
as
well
as
on
Sundays
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
weekdays
you
ca
n't
take
heed
not
to
despise
them
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
,
"
because
then
they
are
out
in
the
fields
.
<EOS>
On
weekdays
they
belong
to
their
parents
,
but
on
Sundays
they
ought
to
belong
to
the
clergyman
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
finger
was
again
raised
.
  
<EOS>
The
master
began
to
understand
and
to
share
the
intense
disgust
which
the
archdeacon
always
expressed
when
Mrs.
Proudie
's
name
was
mentioned
.
<EOS>
What
was
he
to
do
with
such
a
woman
as
this
?
<EOS>
To
take
his
hat
and
go
would
have
been
his
natural
resource
,
but
then
he
did
not
wish
to
be
foiled
in
his
object
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
wanted
to
ask
you
a
question
on
business
,
if
you
could
spare
me
one
moment
's
leisure
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
must
apologize
for
so
disturbing
you
,
but
in
truth
I
will
not
detain
you
five
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
,
Master
,
certainly
,
"
said
the
bishop
;
"
my
time
is
quite
yours
 
<EOS>
pray
make
no
apology
,
pray
make
no
apology
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
great
deal
to
do
just
at
the
present
moment
,
Bishop
.
<EOS>
Do
not
forget
how
extremely
busy
you
are
at
present
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
,
whose
spirit
was
now
up
,
for
she
was
angry
with
her
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
delay
his
lordship
much
above
a
minute
,
"
said
the
Master
of
Lazarus
,
rising
from
his
chair
and
expecting
that
Mrs.
Proudie
would
now
go
,
or
else
that
the
bishop
would
lead
the
way
into
another
room
.
  
<EOS>
But
neither
event
seemed
likely
to
occur
,
and
Dr.
Gwynne
stood
for
a
moment
silent
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
's
about
Hiram
's
Hospital
?
"
suggested
Mrs.
Proudie
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
,
lost
in
astonishment
,
and
not
knowing
what
else
on
earth
to
do
,
confessed
that
his
business
with
the
bishop
was
connected
with
Hiram
's
Hospital
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
lordship
has
finally
conferred
the
appointment
on
Mr.
Quiverful
this
morning
,
"
said
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
made
a
simple
reference
to
the
bishop
,
and
finding
that
the
lady
's
statement
was
formally
confirmed
,
he
took
his
leave
.
<EOS>
"
That
comes
of
the
reform
bill
,
"
he
said
to
himself
as
he
walked
down
the
bishop
's
avenue
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
at
any
rate
the
Greek
play
bishops
were
not
so
bad
as
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
has
been
said
that
Mr.
Slope
,
as
he
started
for
Ullathorne
,
received
a
dispatch
from
his
friend
Mr.
Towers
,
which
had
the
effect
of
putting
him
in
that
high
good
humour
which
subsequent
events
somewhat
untowardly
damped
.
<EOS>
It
ran
as
follows
.
<EOS>
Its
shortness
will
be
its
sufficient
apology
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
SIR
,
  
I
wish
you
every
success
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
I
can
help
you
,
but
if
I
can
,
I
will
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
ever
,
T.
T.
  
30/9/185
    
<EOS>
There
was
more
in
this
than
in
all
Sir
Nicholas
Fitzwhiggin
's
flummery
;
more
than
in
all
the
bishop
's
promises
,
even
had
they
been
ever
so
sincere
;
more
than
in
any
archbishop
's
good
word
,
even
had
it
been
possible
to
obtain
it
.
<EOS>
Tom
Towers
would
do
for
him
what
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
from
his
youth
upwards
been
a
firm
believer
in
the
public
press
.
<EOS>
He
had
dabbled
in
it
himself
ever
since
he
had
taken
his
degree
,
and
he
regarded
it
as
the
great
arranger
and
distributor
of
all
future
British
terrestrial
affairs
whatever
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
yet
arrived
at
the
age
,
an
age
which
sooner
or
later
comes
to
most
of
us
,
which
dissipates
the
golden
dreams
of
youth
.
<EOS>
He
delighted
in
the
idea
of
wresting
power
from
the
hands
of
his
country
's
magnates
and
placing
it
in
a
custody
which
was
at
any
rate
nearer
to
his
own
reach
.
<EOS>
Sixty
thousand
broadsheets
dispersing
themselves
daily
among
his
reading
fellow
citizens
formed
in
his
eyes
a
better
depot
for
supremacy
than
a
throne
at
Windsor
,
a
cabinet
in
Downing
Street
,
or
even
an
assembly
at
Westminster
.
<EOS>
And
on
this
subject
we
must
not
quarrel
with
Mr.
Slope
,
for
the
feeling
is
too
general
to
be
met
with
disrespect
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
Towers
was
as
good
,
if
not
better
,
than
his
promise
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
"
The
Jupiter
,
"
spouting
forth
public
opinion
with
sixty
thousand
loud
clarions
,
did
proclaim
to
the
world
that
Mr.
Slope
was
the
fitting
man
for
the
vacant
post
.
<EOS>
It
was
pleasant
for
Mr.
Slope
to
read
the
following
lines
in
the
Barchester
news
-
room
,
which
he
did
within
thirty
minutes
after
the
morning
train
from
London
had
reached
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
just
now
five
years
since
we
called
the
attention
of
our
readers
to
the
quiet
city
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
From
that
day
to
this
,
we
have
in
no
way
meddled
with
the
affairs
of
that
happy
ecclesiastical
community
.
<EOS>
Since
then
,
an
old
bishop
has
died
there
,
and
a
young
bishop
has
been
installed
;
but
we
believe
we
did
not
do
more
than
give
some
customary
record
of
the
interesting
event
.
<EOS>
Nor
are
we
now
about
to
meddle
very
deeply
in
the
affairs
of
the
diocese
.
<EOS>
If
any
of
the
chapter
feel
a
qualm
of
conscience
on
reading
thus
far
,
let
it
be
quieted
.
<EOS>
Above
all
,
let
the
mind
of
the
new
bishop
be
at
rest
.
<EOS>
We
are
now
not
armed
for
war
,
but
approach
the
reverend
towers
of
the
old
cathedral
with
an
olive
branch
in
our
hands
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
remembered
that
at
the
time
alluded
to
,
now
five
years
past
,
we
had
occasion
to
remark
on
the
state
of
a
charity
in
Barchester
called
Hiram
's
Hospital
.
<EOS>
We
thought
that
it
was
maladministered
,
and
that
the
very
estimable
and
reverend
gentleman
who
held
the
office
of
warden
was
somewhat
too
highly
paid
for
duties
which
were
somewhat
too
easily
performed
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
 
<EOS>
and
we
say
it
in
all
sincerity
and
with
no
touch
of
sarcasm
 
<EOS>
had
never
looked
on
the
matter
in
this
light
before
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
wish
to
take
praise
to
ourselves
whether
praise
be
due
to
us
or
not
.
<EOS>
But
the
consequence
of
our
remark
was
that
the
warden
did
look
into
the
matter
,
and
finding
on
so
doing
that
he
himself
could
come
to
no
other
opinion
than
that
expressed
by
us
,
he
very
creditably
threw
up
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
The
then
bishop
as
creditably
declined
to
fill
the
vacancy
till
the
affair
was
put
on
a
better
footing
.
<EOS>
Parliament
then
took
it
up
,
and
we
have
now
the
satisfaction
of
informing
our
readers
that
Hiram
's
Hospital
will
be
immediately
reopened
under
new
auspices
.
<EOS>
Heretofore
,
provision
was
made
for
the
maintenance
of
twelve
old
men
.
<EOS>
This
will
now
be
extended
to
the
fair
sex
,
and
twelve
elderly
women
,
if
any
such
can
be
found
in
Barchester
,
will
be
added
to
the
establishment
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
a
matron
;
there
will
,
it
is
hoped
,
be
schools
attached
for
the
poorest
of
the
children
of
the
poor
,
and
there
will
be
a
steward
.
<EOS>
The
warden
,
for
there
will
still
be
a
warden
,
will
receive
an
income
more
in
keeping
with
the
extent
of
the
charity
than
that
heretofore
paid
.
<EOS>
The
stipend
we
believe
will
be
£
450
.
<EOS>
We
may
add
that
the
excellent
house
which
the
former
warden
inhabited
will
still
be
attached
to
the
situation
.
  
<EOS>
Barchester
Hospital
can
not
perhaps
boast
a
world
-
wide
reputation
,
but
as
we
adverted
to
its
state
of
decadence
,
we
think
it
right
also
to
advert
to
its
renaissance
.
<EOS>
May
it
go
on
and
prosper
.
<EOS>
Whether
the
salutary
reform
which
has
been
introduced
within
its
walls
has
been
carried
as
far
as
could
have
been
desired
may
be
doubtful
.
<EOS>
The
important
question
of
the
school
appears
to
be
somewhat
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
new
warden
.
<EOS>
This
might
have
been
made
the
most
important
part
of
the
establishment
,
and
the
new
warden
,
whom
we
trust
we
shall
not
offend
by
the
freedom
of
our
remarks
,
might
have
been
selected
with
some
view
to
his
fitness
as
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
But
we
will
not
now
look
a
gift
-
horse
in
the
mouth
.
<EOS>
May
the
hospital
go
on
and
prosper
!
<EOS>
The
situation
of
warden
has
of
course
been
offered
to
the
gentleman
who
so
honourably
vacated
it
five
years
since
,
but
we
are
given
to
understand
that
he
has
declined
it
.
<EOS>
Whether
the
ladies
who
have
been
introduced
be
in
his
estimation
too
much
for
his
powers
of
control
,
whether
it
be
that
the
diminished
income
does
not
offer
to
him
sufficient
temptation
to
resume
his
old
place
,
or
that
he
has
in
the
meantime
assumed
other
clerical
duties
,
we
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
We
are
,
however
,
informed
that
he
has
refused
the
offer
and
that
the
situation
has
been
accepted
by
Mr.
Quiverful
,
the
vicar
of
Puddingdale
.
  
<EOS>
So
much
we
think
is
due
to
Hiram
redivivus
.
<EOS>
But
while
we
are
on
the
subject
of
Barchester
,
we
will
venture
with
all
respectful
humility
to
express
our
opinion
on
another
matter
connected
with
the
ecclesiastical
polity
of
that
ancient
city
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Trefoil
,
the
dean
,
died
yesterday
.
<EOS>
A
short
record
of
his
death
,
giving
his
age
and
the
various
pieces
of
preferment
which
he
has
at
different
times
held
,
will
be
found
in
another
column
of
this
paper
.
<EOS>
The
only
fault
we
knew
in
him
was
his
age
,
and
as
that
is
a
crime
of
which
we
all
hope
to
be
guilty
,
we
will
not
bear
heavily
on
it
.
<EOS>
May
he
rest
in
peace
!
<EOS>
But
though
the
great
age
of
an
expiring
dean
can
not
be
made
matter
of
reproach
,
we
are
not
inclined
to
look
on
such
a
fault
as
at
all
pardonable
in
a
dean
just
brought
to
the
birth
.
<EOS>
We
do
hope
that
the
days
of
sexagenarian
appointments
are
past
.
<EOS>
If
we
want
deans
,
we
must
want
them
for
some
purpose
.
<EOS>
That
purpose
will
necessarily
be
better
fulfilled
by
a
man
of
forty
than
by
a
man
of
sixty
.
<EOS>
If
we
are
to
pay
deans
at
all
,
we
are
to
pay
them
for
some
sort
of
work
.
<EOS>
That
work
,
be
it
what
it
may
,
will
be
best
performed
by
a
workman
in
the
prime
of
life
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Trefoil
,
we
see
,
was
eighty
when
he
died
.
<EOS>
As
we
have
as
yet
completed
no
plan
for
pensioning
superannuated
clergymen
,
we
do
not
wish
to
get
rid
of
any
existing
deans
of
that
age
.
<EOS>
But
we
prefer
having
as
few
such
as
possible
.
<EOS>
If
a
man
of
seventy
be
now
appointed
,
we
beg
to
point
out
to
Lord
 
---
that
he
will
be
past
all
use
in
a
year
or
two
,
if
indeed
he
be
not
so
at
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
will
allow
us
to
remind
him
that
all
men
are
not
evergreens
like
himself
.
  
<EOS>
We
hear
that
Mr.
Slope
's
name
has
been
mentioned
for
this
preferment
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
is
at
present
chaplain
to
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
A
better
man
could
hardly
be
selected
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
man
of
talent
,
young
,
active
,
and
conversant
with
the
affairs
of
the
cathedral
;
he
is
moreover
,
we
conscientiously
believe
,
a
truly
pious
clergyman
.
<EOS>
We
know
that
his
services
in
the
city
of
Barchester
have
been
highly
appreciated
.
<EOS>
He
is
an
eloquent
preacher
and
a
ripe
scholar
.
<EOS>
Such
a
selection
as
this
would
go
far
to
raise
the
confidence
of
the
public
in
the
present
administration
of
church
patronage
and
would
teach
men
to
believe
that
from
henceforth
the
establishment
of
our
church
will
not
afford
easy
couches
to
worn
-
out
clerical
voluptuaries
.
  
<EOS>
Standing
at
a
reading
-
desk
in
the
Barchester
news
-
room
,
Mr.
Slope
digested
this
article
with
considerable
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
What
was
therein
said
as
to
the
hospital
was
now
comparatively
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
certainly
glad
that
he
had
not
succeeded
in
restoring
to
the
place
the
father
of
that
virago
who
had
so
audaciously
outraged
all
decency
in
his
person
,
and
was
so
far
satisfied
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Proudie
's
nominee
was
appointed
,
and
he
was
so
far
dissatisfied
.
<EOS>
His
mind
,
however
,
was
now
soaring
above
Mrs.
Bold
or
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
He
was
sufficiently
conversant
with
the
tactics
of
"
The
Jupiter
"
to
know
that
the
pith
of
the
article
would
lie
in
the
last
paragraph
.
<EOS>
The
place
of
honour
was
given
to
him
,
and
it
was
indeed
as
honourable
as
even
he
could
have
wished
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
grateful
to
his
friend
Mr.
Towers
,
and
with
full
heart
looked
forward
to
the
day
when
he
might
entertain
him
in
princely
style
at
his
own
full
-
spread
board
in
the
deanery
dining
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
It
had
been
well
for
Mr.
Slope
that
Dr.
Trefoil
had
died
in
the
autumn
.
<EOS>
Those
caterers
for
our
morning
repast
,
the
staff
of
"
The
Jupiter
,
"
had
been
sorely
put
to
it
for
the
last
month
to
find
a
sufficiency
of
proper
pabulum
.
<EOS>
Just
then
there
was
no
talk
of
a
new
American
president
.
<EOS>
No
wonderful
tragedies
had
occurred
on
railway
trains
in
Georgia
,
or
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
dearth
of
broken
banks
,
and
a
dead
dean
with
the
necessity
for
a
live
one
was
a
godsend
.
<EOS>
Had
Dr.
Trefoil
died
in
June
,
Mr.
Towers
would
probably
not
have
known
so
much
about
the
piety
of
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
And
here
we
will
leave
Mr.
Slope
for
awhile
in
his
triumph
,
explaining
,
however
,
that
his
feelings
were
not
altogether
of
a
triumphant
nature
.
<EOS>
His
rejection
by
the
widow
,
or
rather
the
method
of
his
rejection
,
galled
him
terribly
.
<EOS>
For
days
to
come
he
positively
felt
the
sting
upon
his
cheek
whenever
he
thought
of
what
had
been
done
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
refrain
from
calling
her
by
harsh
names
,
speaking
to
himself
as
he
walked
through
the
streets
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
When
he
said
his
prayers
,
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
forgive
her
.
<EOS>
When
he
strove
to
do
so
,
his
mind
recoiled
from
the
attempt
,
and
in
lieu
of
forgiving
ran
off
in
a
double
spirit
of
vindictiveness
,
dwelling
on
the
extent
of
the
injury
he
had
received
.
<EOS>
And
so
his
prayers
dropped
senseless
from
his
lips
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
the
signora
 
<EOS>
what
would
he
not
have
given
to
be
able
to
hate
her
also
?
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
he
worshipped
the
very
sofa
on
which
she
was
ever
lying
.
  
<EOS>
And
thus
it
was
not
all
rose
colour
with
Mr.
Slope
,
although
his
hopes
ran
high
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
at
Home
 
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Bold
,
when
she
got
home
from
Ullathorne
on
the
evening
of
Miss
Thorne
's
party
,
was
very
unhappy
and
,
moreover
,
very
tired
.
<EOS>
Nothing
fatigues
the
body
so
much
as
weariness
of
spirit
,
and
Eleanor
's
spirit
was
indeed
weary
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Stanhope
had
civilly
<EOS>
but
not
very
cordially
asked
her
in
to
tea
,
and
her
manner
of
refusal
convinced
the
worthy
doctor
that
he
need
not
repeat
the
invitation
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
exactly
made
himself
a
party
to
the
intrigue
which
was
to
convert
the
late
Mr.
Bold
's
patrimony
into
an
income
for
his
hopeful
son
,
but
he
had
been
well
aware
what
was
going
on
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
well
aware
also
,
when
he
perceived
that
Bertie
declined
accompanying
them
home
in
the
carriage
,
that
the
affair
had
gone
off
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
was
very
much
afraid
that
Charlotte
would
have
darted
out
upon
her
,
as
the
prebendary
got
out
at
his
own
door
,
but
Bertie
had
thoughtfully
saved
her
from
this
by
causing
the
carriage
to
go
round
by
her
own
house
.
<EOS>
This
also
Dr.
Stanhope
understood
and
allowed
to
pass
by
without
remark
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
got
home
,
she
found
Mary
Bold
in
the
drawing
-
room
with
the
child
in
her
lap
.
<EOS>
She
rushed
forward
and
,
throwing
herself
on
her
knees
,
kissed
the
little
fellow
till
she
almost
frightened
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mary
,
I
am
so
glad
you
did
not
go
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
odious
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
the
question
of
Mary
's
going
had
been
one
greatly
mooted
between
them
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
,
when
invited
,
had
been
the
guest
of
the
Grantlys
,
and
Miss
Thorne
,
who
had
chiefly
known
Eleanor
at
the
hospital
or
at
Plumstead
Rectory
,
had
forgotten
all
about
Mary
Bold
.
<EOS>
Her
sister
-
in
-
law
had
implored
her
to
go
under
her
wing
and
had
offered
to
write
to
Miss
Thorne
,
or
to
call
on
her
.
<EOS>
But
Miss
Bold
had
declined
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
Mr.
Bold
had
not
been
very
popular
with
such
people
as
the
Thornes
,
and
his
sister
would
not
go
among
them
unless
she
were
specially
asked
to
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
said
Mary
cheerfully
,
"
I
have
the
less
to
regret
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
nothing
to
regret
;
but
oh
!
<EOS>
Mary
,
I
have
 
so
much
 
so
much
;
"
and
then
she
began
kissing
her
boy
,
whom
her
caresses
had
roused
from
his
slumbers
.
<EOS>
When
she
raised
her
head
,
Mary
saw
that
the
tears
were
running
down
her
cheeks
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
heavens
,
Eleanor
<EOS>
,
what
is
the
matter
?
<EOS>
What
has
happened
to
you
 
Eleanor
 
<EOS>
dearest
Eleanor
 
<EOS>
what
is
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
and
Mary
got
up
with
the
boy
still
in
her
arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
him
to
me
 
give
him
to
me
,
"
said
the
young
mother
.
<EOS>
"
Give
him
to
me
,
Mary
,
"
and
she
almost
tore
the
child
out
of
her
sister
's
arms
.
<EOS>
The
poor
little
fellow
murmured
somewhat
at
the
disturbance
but
nevertheless
nestled
himself
close
into
his
mother
's
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
Mary
,
take
the
cloak
from
me
.
<EOS>
My
own
own
darling
,
darling
,
darling
jewel
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
false
to
me
.
<EOS>
Everybody
else
is
false
;
everybody
else
is
cruel
.
<EOS>
Mamma
will
care
for
nobody
,
nobody
,
nobody
,
but
her
own
,
own
,
own
little
man
;
"
and
she
again
kissed
and
pressed
the
baby
and
cried
till
the
tears
ran
down
over
the
child
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
has
been
cruel
to
you
,
Eleanor
?
"
said
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
have
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Now
in
this
matter
Eleanor
had
great
cause
for
mental
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
certainly
accuse
her
loving
sister
-
in
-
law
of
cruelty
;
but
she
had
to
do
that
which
was
more
galling
:
she
had
to
accuse
herself
of
imprudence
against
which
her
sister
-
in
-
law
had
warned
her
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bold
had
never
encouraged
Eleanor
's
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Slope
,
and
she
had
positively
discouraged
the
friendship
of
the
Stanhopes
,
as
far
as
her
usual
gentle
mode
of
speaking
had
permitted
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
had
only
laughed
at
her
,
however
,
when
she
said
that
she
disapproved
of
married
women
who
lived
apart
from
their
husbands
and
suggested
that
Charlotte
Stanhope
never
went
to
church
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
Eleanor
must
either
hold
her
tongue
,
which
was
quite
impossible
,
or
confess
herself
to
have
been
utterly
wrong
,
which
was
nearly
equally
so
.
<EOS>
So
she
staved
off
the
evil
day
by
more
tears
,
and
consoled
herself
by
inducing
little
Johnny
to
rouse
himself
sufficiently
to
return
her
caresses
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
darling
 
as
true
as
gold
.
<EOS>
What
would
mamma
do
without
him
?
<EOS>
Mamma
would
lie
down
and
die
if
she
had
not
her
own
Johnny
Bold
to
give
her
comfort
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
and
much
more
she
said
of
the
same
kind
,
and
for
a
time
made
no
other
answer
to
Mary
's
inquiries
.
  
<EOS>
This
kind
of
consolation
from
the
world
's
deceit
is
very
common
.
<EOS>
Mothers
obtain
it
from
their
children
,
and
men
from
their
dogs
.
<EOS>
Some
men
even
do
so
from
their
walking
-
sticks
,
which
is
just
as
rational
.
<EOS>
How
is
it
that
we
can
take
joy
to
ourselves
in
that
we
are
not
deceived
by
those
who
have
not
attained
the
art
to
deceive
us
?
<EOS>
In
a
true
man
,
if
such
can
be
found
,
or
a
true
woman
,
much
consolation
may
indeed
be
taken
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
caresses
of
her
child
,
however
,
Eleanor
did
receive
consolation
,
and
may
ill
befall
the
man
who
would
begrudge
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
evil
day
,
however
,
was
only
postponed
.
<EOS>
She
had
to
tell
her
disagreeable
tale
to
Mary
,
and
she
had
also
to
tell
it
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
Must
it
not
,
indeed
,
be
told
to
the
whole
circle
of
her
acquaintance
before
she
could
be
made
to
stand
all
right
with
them
?
<EOS>
At
the
present
moment
there
was
no
one
to
whom
she
could
turn
for
comfort
.
<EOS>
She
hated
Mr.
Slope
;
that
was
a
matter
of
course
;
in
that
feeling
she
revelled
.
<EOS>
She
hated
and
despised
the
Stanhopes
;
but
that
feeling
distressed
her
greatly
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
as
it
were
,
separated
herself
from
her
old
friends
to
throw
herself
into
the
arms
of
this
family
;
and
then
how
had
they
intended
to
use
her
?
<EOS>
She
could
hardly
reconcile
herself
to
her
own
father
,
who
had
believed
ill
of
her
.
<EOS>
Mary
Bold
had
turned
Mentor
.
<EOS>
That
she
could
have
forgiven
had
the
Mentor
turned
out
to
be
in
the
wrong
,
but
Mentors
in
the
right
are
not
to
be
pardoned
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
hate
the
archdeacon
,
and
now
she
hated
him
worse
than
ever
,
for
she
must
in
some
sort
humble
herself
before
him
.
<EOS>
She
hated
her
sister
,
for
she
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
And
she
would
have
hated
Mr.
Arabin
if
she
could
.
<EOS>
He
had
pretended
to
regard
her
,
and
yet
before
her
face
he
had
hung
over
that
Italian
woman
as
though
there
had
been
no
beauty
in
the
world
but
<EOS>
hers
 
<EOS>
no
other
woman
worth
a
moment
's
attention
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Arabin
would
have
to
learn
all
this
about
Mr.
Slope
!
<EOS>
She
told
herself
that
she
hated
him
,
and
she
knew
that
she
was
lying
to
herself
as
she
did
so
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
consolation
but
her
baby
,
and
of
that
she
made
the
most
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
though
she
could
not
surmise
what
it
was
that
had
so
violently
affected
her
sister
-
in
-
law
,
saw
at
once
that
her
grief
was
too
great
to
be
kept
under
control
and
waited
patiently
till
the
child
should
be
in
his
cradle
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
have
some
tea
,
Eleanor
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
care
,
"
said
she
,
though
in
fact
she
must
have
been
very
hungry
,
for
she
had
eaten
nothing
at
Ullathorne
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
quietly
made
the
tea
,
and
buttered
the
bread
,
laid
aside
the
cloak
,
and
made
things
look
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
fast
asleep
,
"
said
she
;
"
you
're
very
tired
;
let
me
take
him
up
to
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Eleanor
would
not
let
her
sister
touch
him
.
<EOS>
She
looked
wistfully
at
her
baby
's
eyes
,
saw
that
they
were
lost
in
the
deepest
slumber
,
and
then
made
a
sort
of
couch
for
him
on
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
She
was
determined
that
nothing
should
prevail
upon
her
to
let
him
out
of
her
sight
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Nelly
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
do
n't
be
cross
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
at
least
have
done
nothing
to
offend
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
an't
cross
,
"
said
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
angry
then
?
<EOS>
Surely
you
ca
n't
be
angry
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
an't
angry
 
at
least
not
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
not
,
drink
the
tea
I
have
made
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
must
want
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
did
drink
it
,
and
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
.
<EOS>
She
ate
and
drank
,
and
as
the
inner
woman
was
recruited
she
felt
a
little
more
charitable
towards
the
world
at
large
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
found
words
to
begin
her
story
,
and
before
she
went
to
bed
she
had
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
told
everything
 
everything
,
that
is
,
as
to
the
lovers
she
had
rejected
;
of
Mr.
Arabin
<EOS>
she
said
not
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
was
wrong
,
"
said
she
,
speaking
of
the
blow
she
had
given
to
Mr.
Slope
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
did
n't
know
what
he
might
do
,
and
I
had
to
protect
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
richly
deserved
it
,
"
said
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Deserved
it
!
"
<EOS>
said
Eleanor
,
whose
mind
as
regarded
Mr.
Slope
was
almost
bloodthirsty
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Had
I
stabbed
him
with
a
dagger
,
he
would
have
deserved
it
.
<EOS>
But
what
will
they
say
about
it
at
Plumstead
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
should
tell
them
,
"
said
Mary
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
began
to
think
that
she
would
not
.
  
<EOS>
There
could
have
been
no
kinder
comforter
than
Mary
Bold
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
the
slightest
dash
of
triumph
about
her
when
she
heard
of
the
Stanhope
scheme
,
nor
did
she
allude
to
her
former
opinion
when
Eleanor
called
her
late
friend
Charlotte
<EOS>
a
base
,
designing
woman
.
<EOS>
She
re
-
echoed
all
the
abuse
that
was
heaped
on
Mr.
Slope
's
head
and
never
hinted
that
she
had
said
as
much
before
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
so
,
I
told
you
so
!
<EOS>
"
is
the
croak
of
a
true
Job
's
comforter
.
<EOS>
But
Mary
,
when
she
found
her
friend
lying
in
her
sorrow
and
scraping
herself
with
potsherds
,
forbore
to
argue
and
to
exult
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
acknowledged
the
merit
of
the
forbearance
,
and
at
length
allowed
herself
to
be
tranquilised
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
next
day
she
did
not
go
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Barchester
<EOS>
she
thought
would
be
crowded
with
Stanhopes
and
Slopes
;
perhaps
also
with
Arabins
and
Grantlys
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
there
was
hardly
anyone
among
her
friends
whom
she
could
have
met
without
some
cause
of
uneasiness
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
afternoon
she
heard
that
the
dean
was
dead
,
and
she
also
heard
that
Mr.
Quiverful
had
been
finally
appointed
to
the
hospital
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
evening
her
father
came
to
her
,
and
then
the
story
,
or
as
much
of
it
as
she
could
bring
herself
to
tell
him
,
had
to
be
repeated
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
in
truth
much
surprised
at
Mr.
Slope
's
effrontery
,
but
he
was
obliged
to
act
as
though
he
had
been
to
save
his
daughter
's
feelings
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
however
,
anything
but
skilful
in
his
deceit
,
and
she
saw
through
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
"
said
she
,
"
that
you
think
it
only
in
the
common
course
of
things
that
Mr.
Slope
should
have
treated
me
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
She
had
said
nothing
to
him
about
the
embrace
,
nor
yet
of
the
way
in
which
it
had
been
met
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
it
at
all
strange
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
anyone
should
admire
my
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
strange
to
me
,
"
said
she
,
"
that
any
man
should
have
so
much
audacity
,
without
ever
having
received
the
slightest
encouragement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
To
this
Mr.
Harding
answered
nothing
.
<EOS>
With
the
archdeacon
it
would
have
been
the
text
for
a
rejoinder
which
would
not
have
disgraced
Bildad
the
Shuhite
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
'll
tell
the
archdeacon
?
"
asked
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
what
?
"
said
she
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Or
Susan
?
"
continued
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
tell
Susan
;
you
'll
let
them
know
that
they
wronged
you
in
supposing
that
this
man
's
addresses
would
be
agreeable
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
may
find
that
out
their
own
way
,
"
said
she
;
"
I
shall
not
ever
willingly
mention
Mr.
Slope
's
name
to
either
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
may
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
right
to
hinder
you
from
doing
anything
that
may
be
necessary
to
your
own
comfort
,
but
pray
do
not
do
it
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
never
thought
well
of
me
,
and
never
will
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
now
that
I
am
even
anxious
that
he
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
then
they
went
to
the
affair
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
"
But
is
it
true
,
Papa
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
my
dear
?
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
About
the
dean
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
fear
quite
true
.
<EOS>
Indeed
I
know
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Miss
Trefoil
,
I
am
so
sorry
for
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
did
not
mean
that
,
"
said
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
But
about
the
hospital
,
Papa
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
is
true
that
Mr.
Quiverful
is
to
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
a
shame
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
,
not
at
all
,
not
at
all
a
shame
<EOS>
:
I
am
sure
I
hope
it
will
suit
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Papa
,
you
know
it
is
a
shame
.
<EOS>
After
all
your
hopes
,
all
your
expectations
to
get
back
to
your
old
house
,
to
see
it
given
away
in
this
way
to
a
perfect
stranger
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
the
bishop
had
a
right
to
give
it
to
whom
he
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
deny
that
,
Papa
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
such
right
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
as
though
you
were
a
candidate
for
a
new
piece
of
preferment
.
<EOS>
If
the
bishop
has
a
grain
of
justice
 
"
  
"
The
bishop
offered
it
to
me
on
his
terms
,
and
as
I
did
not
like
the
terms
,
I
refused
it
.
<EOS>
After
that
,
I
can
not
complain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Terms
!
<EOS>
He
had
no
right
to
make
terms
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
about
that
;
but
it
seems
he
had
the
power
.
<EOS>
But
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
Nelly
,
I
am
as
well
satisfied
as
it
is
.
<EOS>
When
the
affair
became
the
subject
of
angry
discussion
,
I
thoroughly
wished
to
be
rid
of
it
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
did
want
to
go
back
to
the
old
house
,
Papa
.
<EOS>
You
told
me
so
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
I
did
.
<EOS>
For
a
short
time
I
did
wish
it
.
<EOS>
And
I
was
foolish
in
doing
so
.
<EOS>
I
am
getting
old
now
,
and
my
chief
worldly
wish
is
for
peace
and
rest
.
<EOS>
Had
I
gone
back
to
the
hospital
,
I
should
have
had
endless
contentions
with
the
bishop
,
contentions
with
his
chaplain
,
and
contentions
with
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
up
to
this
now
;
I
am
not
able
to
meet
such
troubles
;
and
therefore
I
am
not
ill
-
pleased
to
find
myself
left
to
the
little
church
of
St.
Cuthbert
's
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
starve
,
"
added
he
,
laughing
,
"
as
long
as
you
are
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
will
you
come
and
live
with
me
,
Papa
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
earnestly
,
taking
him
by
both
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
do
that
,
if
you
will
promise
that
,
I
will
own
that
you
are
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
dine
with
you
to
-
day
at
any
rate
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
,
but
live
here
altogether
.
<EOS>
Give
up
that
close
,
odious
little
room
in
High
Street
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
it
's
a
very
nice
little
room
,
and
you
are
really
quite
uncivil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Papa
,
do
n't
joke
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
a
nice
place
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
say
you
are
growing
old
,
though
I
am
sure
you
are
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Am
not
I
,
my
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Papa
,
not
old
 
not
to
say
old
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
quite
old
enough
to
feel
the
want
of
a
decent
room
to
sit
in
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
lonely
Mary
and
I
are
here
.
<EOS>
You
know
nobody
ever
sleeps
in
the
big
front
bedroom
.
<EOS>
It
is
really
unkind
of
you
to
remain
up
there
alone
,
when
you
are
so
much
wanted
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Nelly
 
thank
you
.
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
 
"
  
"
If
you
had
been
living
here
,
Papa
,
with
us
,
as
I
really
think
you
ought
to
have
done
,
considering
how
lonely
we
are
,
there
would
have
been
none
of
all
this
dreadful
affair
about
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
,
however
,
did
not
allow
himself
to
be
talked
over
into
giving
up
his
own
and
only
little
_
pied
à
terre
_
in
the
High
Street
.
<EOS>
He
promised
to
come
and
dine
with
his
daughter
,
and
stay
with
her
,
and
visit
her
,
and
do
everything
but
absolutely
live
with
her
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
suit
the
peculiar
feelings
of
the
man
to
tell
his
daughter
that
though
she
had
rejected
Mr.
Slope
,
and
been
ready
to
reject
Mr.
Stanhope
,
some
other
more
favoured
suitor
would
probably
soon
appear
,
and
that
on
the
appearance
of
such
a
suitor
the
big
front
bedroom
might
perhaps
be
more
frequently
in
requisition
than
at
present
.
<EOS>
But
doubtless
such
an
idea
crossed
his
mind
,
and
added
its
weight
to
the
other
reasons
which
made
him
decide
on
still
keeping
the
close
,
odious
little
room
in
High
Street
.
  
<EOS>
The
evening
passed
over
quietly
and
in
comfort
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
was
always
happier
with
her
father
than
with
anyone
else
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
,
perhaps
,
any
natural
taste
for
baby
-
worship
,
but
he
was
always
ready
to
sacrifice
himself
,
and
therefore
made
an
excellent
third
in
a
trio
with
his
daughter
and
Mary
Bold
in
singing
the
praises
of
the
wonderful
child
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
standing
together
over
their
music
in
the
evening
,
the
baby
having
again
been
put
to
bed
upon
the
sofa
,
when
the
servant
brought
in
a
very
small
note
in
a
beautiful
pink
envelope
.
<EOS>
It
quite
filled
the
room
with
perfume
as
it
lay
upon
the
small
salver
.
<EOS>
Mary
Bold
and
Mrs.
Bold
were
both
at
the
piano
,
and
Mr.
Harding
was
sitting
close
to
them
,
with
the
violoncello
between
his
legs
,
so
that
the
elegancy
of
the
epistle
was
visible
to
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
Please
ma'am
,
Dr.
Stanhope
's
coachman
says
he
is
to
wait
for
an
answer
,
"
said
the
servant
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
got
very
red
in
the
face
as
she
took
the
note
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
seen
the
writing
before
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
's
epistles
,
to
which
she
was
well
accustomed
,
were
of
a
very
different
style
and
kind
.
<EOS>
She
generally
wrote
on
large
note
-
paper
;
she
twisted
up
her
letters
into
the
shape
and
sometimes
into
the
size
of
cocked
hats
;
she
addressed
them
in
a
sprawling
,
manly
hand
,
and
not
unusually
added
a
blot
or
a
smudge
,
as
though
such
were
her
own
peculiar
sign
-
manual
.
<EOS>
The
address
of
this
note
was
written
in
a
beautiful
female
hand
,
and
the
gummed
wafer
bore
on
it
an
impress
of
a
gilt
coronet
.
<EOS>
Though
Eleanor
had
never
seen
such
a
one
before
,
she
guessed
that
it
came
from
the
signora
.
<EOS>
Such
epistles
were
very
numerously
sent
out
from
any
house
in
which
the
signora
might
happen
to
be
dwelling
,
but
they
were
rarely
addressed
to
ladies
.
<EOS>
When
the
coachman
was
told
by
the
lady
's
maid
to
take
the
letter
to
Mrs.
Bold
,
he
openly
expressed
his
opinion
that
there
was
some
mistake
about
it
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
lady
's
maid
boxed
the
coachman
's
ears
.
<EOS>
Had
Mr.
Slope
seen
in
how
meek
a
spirit
the
coachman
took
the
rebuke
,
he
might
have
learnt
a
useful
lesson
,
both
in
philosophy
and
religion
.
  
<EOS>
The
note
was
as
follows
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
taken
as
a
faithful
promise
that
no
further
letter
whatever
shall
be
transcribed
at
length
in
these
pages
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
MRS
.
<EOS>
BOLD
,
  
<EOS>
May
I
ask
you
,
as
a
great
favour
,
to
call
on
me
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
You
can
say
what
hour
will
best
suit
you
,
but
quite
early
,
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
say
that
if
I
could
call
upon
you
,
I
should
not
take
this
liberty
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
partly
know
what
occurred
the
other
day
,
and
I
promise
you
that
you
shall
meet
with
no
annoyance
if
you
will
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
My
brother
leaves
us
for
London
to
-
day
;
from
thence
he
goes
to
Italy
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
probably
occur
to
you
that
I
should
not
thus
intrude
on
you
,
unless
I
had
that
to
say
to
you
which
may
be
of
considerable
moment
.
<EOS>
Pray
therefore
excuse
me
,
even
if
you
do
not
grant
my
request
.
  
<EOS>
And
believe
me
,
Very
sincerely
yours
,
  
M.
VESEY

<EOS>
Thursday
Evening
  
<EOS>
The
three
of
them
sat
in
consultation
on
this
epistle
for
some
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
,
and
then
decided
that
Eleanor
should
write
a
line
saying
that
she
would
see
the
signora
the
next
morning
at
twelve
o'clock
.
   
<EOS>
The
Stanhopes
at
Home
 
<EOS>
We
must
now
return
to
the
Stanhopes
and
see
how
they
behaved
themselves
on
their
return
from
Ullathorne
.
  
<EOS>
Charlotte
,
who
came
back
in
the
first
homeward
journey
with
her
sister
,
waited
in
palpitating
expectation
till
the
carriage
drove
up
to
the
door
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
run
down
,
or
stand
at
the
window
,
or
show
in
any
outward
manner
that
she
looked
for
anything
wonderful
to
occur
;
but
when
she
heard
the
carriage
wheels
,
she
stood
up
with
erect
ears
,
listening
for
Eleanor
's
footfall
on
the
pavement
,
or
the
cheery
sound
of
Bertie
's
voice
welcoming
her
in
.
<EOS>
Had
she
heard
either
,
she
would
have
felt
that
all
was
right
;
but
neither
sound
was
there
for
her
to
hear
.
<EOS>
She
heard
only
her
father
's
slow
step
as
he
ponderously
let
himself
down
from
the
carriage
and
slowly
walked
along
the
hall
,
till
he
got
into
his
own
private
room
on
the
ground
floor
.
"
<EOS>
Send
Miss
Stanhope
to
me
,
"
he
said
to
the
servant
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
something
wrong
now
,
"
said
Madeline
,
who
was
lying
on
her
sofa
in
the
back
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
up
with
Bertie
,
"
replied
Charlotte
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
I
know
,
"
she
said
to
the
servant
as
he
brought
up
the
message
.
"
<EOS>
Tell
my
father
I
will
be
with
him
immediately
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bertie
's
wooing
has
gone
astray
,
"
said
Madeline
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
it
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
his
own
fault
then
.
<EOS>
She
was
ready
enough
,
I
am
quite
sure
,
"
said
Charlotte
with
that
sort
of
ill
-
nature
which
is
not
uncommon
when
one
woman
speaks
of
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
will
you
say
to
him
now
?
"
<EOS>
By
"
him
,
"
the
signora
meant
their
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
will
be
as
I
find
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
ready
to
pay
two
hundred
pounds
for
Bertie
to
stave
off
the
worst
of
his
creditors
,
if
this
marriage
had
gone
on
.
<EOS>
Bertie
must
now
have
the
money
instead
and
go
and
take
his
chance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Heaven
knows
!
<EOS>
Smoking
in
the
bottom
of
Mr.
Thorne
's
ha
-
ha
,
or
philandering
with
some
of
those
Miss
Chadwicks
.
<EOS>
Nothing
will
ever
make
an
impression
on
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
'll
be
furious
if
I
do
n't
go
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
nothing
ever
will
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
be
long
,
Charlotte
,
for
I
want
my
tea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
Charlotte
went
down
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
very
black
cloud
on
the
old
man
's
brow
 
blacker
than
his
daughter
could
ever
yet
remember
to
have
seen
there
.
<EOS>
He
was
sitting
in
his
own
armchair
,
not
comfortably
over
the
fire
,
but
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
waiting
till
she
should
come
and
listen
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
has
become
of
your
brother
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
as
soon
as
the
door
was
shut
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
rather
ask
you
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
<EOS>
"
I
left
you
both
at
Ullathorne
when
I
came
away
.
<EOS>
What
have
you
done
with
Mrs.
Bold
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Bold
!
<EOS>
Nonsense
.
<EOS>
The
woman
has
gone
home
as
she
ought
to
do
.
<EOS>
And
heartily
glad
I
am
that
she
should
not
be
sacrificed
to
so
heartless
a
reprobate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Papa
!
"
  
"
A
heartless
reprobate
!
<EOS>
Tell
me
now
where
he
is
and
what
he
is
going
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
allowed
myself
to
be
fooled
between
you
.
<EOS>
Marriage
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Who
on
earth
that
has
money
,
or
credit
,
or
respect
in
the
world
to
lose
would
marry
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
no
use
your
scolding
me
,
Papa
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
the
best
I
could
for
him
and
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
Madeline
is
nearly
as
bad
,
"
said
the
prebendary
,
who
was
in
truth
very
,
very
angry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
suppose
we
are
all
bad
,
"
replied
Charlotte
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
emitted
a
huge
,
leonine
sigh
.
<EOS>
If
they
were
all
bad
,
who
had
made
them
so
?
<EOS>
If
they
were
unprincipled
,
selfish
,
and
disreputable
,
who
was
to
be
blamed
for
the
education
which
had
had
so
injurious
an
effect
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
'll
ruin
me
among
you
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Papa
,
what
nonsense
that
is
.
<EOS>
You
are
living
within
your
income
this
minute
,
and
if
there
are
any
new
debts
,
I
do
n't
know
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
there
ought
to
be
none
,
for
we
are
dull
enough
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
those
bills
of
Madeline
's
paid
?
"
  
"
No
,
they
are
not
.
<EOS>
Who
was
to
pay
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
husband
may
pay
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
husband
!
<EOS>
Would
you
wish
me
to
tell
her
you
say
so
?
<EOS>
Do
you
wish
to
turn
her
out
of
your
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
she
would
know
how
to
behave
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
on
earth
has
she
done
now
?
<EOS>
Poor
Madeline
!
<EOS>
To
-
day
is
only
the
second
time
she
has
gone
out
since
we
came
to
this
vile
town
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
sat
silent
for
a
time
,
thinking
in
what
shape
he
would
declare
his
resolve
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Papa
,
"
said
Charlotte
,
"
shall
I
stay
here
,
or
may
I
go
upstairs
and
give
Mamma
her
tea
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
your
brother
's
confidence
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
what
he
is
going
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
that
I
am
aware
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
 
nothing
!
<EOS>
Nothing
but
eat
and
drink
and
spend
every
shilling
of
my
money
he
can
lay
his
hands
upon
.
<EOS>
I
have
made
up
my
mind
,
Charlotte
.
<EOS>
He
shall
eat
and
drink
no
more
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
Then
I
suppose
he
must
go
back
to
Italy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
may
go
where
he
pleases
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
easily
said
,
Papa
,
but
<EOS>
what
does
it
mean
?
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
let
him
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
means
this
?
"
said
the
doctor
,
speaking
more
loudly
than
was
his
wo
nt
and
with
wrath
flashing
from
his
eyes
;
"
that
as
sure
as
God
rules
in
heaven
I
will
not
maintain
him
any
longer
in
idleness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
ruling
in
heaven
!
"
said
Charlotte
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
no
use
talking
about
that
.
<EOS>
You
must
rule
him
here
on
earth
;
and
the
question
is
,
how
can
you
do
it
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
turn
him
out
of
the
house
penniless
,
to
beg
about
the
street
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
may
beg
where
he
likes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
must
go
back
to
Carrara
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
cheapest
place
he
can
live
at
,
and
nobody
there
will
give
him
credit
for
above
two
or
three
hundred
pauls
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
let
him
have
the
means
of
going
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
sure
as
 
"
  
"
Oh
,
Papa
,
do
n't
swear
.
<EOS>
You
know
you
must
do
it
.
<EOS>
You
were
ready
to
pay
two
hundred
pounds
for
him
if
this
marriage
came
off
.
<EOS>
Half
that
will
start
him
to
Carrara
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
?
<EOS>
Give
him
a
hundred
pounds
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
we
are
all
in
the
dark
,
Papa
,
"
said
she
,
thinking
it
expedient
to
change
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
For
anything
we
know
he
may
be
at
this
moment
engaged
to
Mrs.
Bold
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fiddlestick
,
"
said
the
father
,
who
had
seen
the
way
in
which
Mrs.
Bold
had
got
into
the
carriage
while
his
son
stood
apart
without
even
offering
her
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
he
must
go
to
Carrara
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
  
<EOS>
Just
at
this
moment
the
lock
of
the
front
door
was
heard
,
and
Charlotte
's
quick
ears
detected
her
brother
's
catlike
step
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
She
said
nothing
,
feeling
that
for
the
present
Bertie
had
better
keep
out
of
her
father
's
way
.
<EOS>
But
Dr.
Stanhope
also
heard
the
sound
of
the
lock
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
he
demanded
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
made
no
reply
,
and
he
asked
again
,
"
Who
is
that
that
has
just
come
in
?
<EOS>
Open
the
door
.
<EOS>
Who
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
is
Bertie
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bid
him
come
here
,
"
said
the
father
.
<EOS>
But
Bertie
,
who
was
close
to
the
door
and
heard
the
call
,
required
no
further
bidding
,
but
walked
in
with
a
perfectly
unconcerned
and
cheerful
air
.
<EOS>
It
was
this
peculiar
_
insouciance
_
which
angered
Dr.
Stanhope
,
even
more
than
his
son
's
extravagance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
?
"
said
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
did
you
get
home
,
sir
,
with
your
fair
companion
?
"
said
Bertie
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
she
is
not
upstairs
,
Charlotte
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bertie
,
"
said
Charlotte
,
"
Papa
is
in
no
humour
for
joking
.
<EOS>
He
is
very
angry
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Angry
!
"
said
Bertie
,
raising
his
eyebrows
as
though
he
had
never
yet
given
his
parent
cause
for
a
single
moment
's
uneasiness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
if
you
please
,
sir
,
"
said
Dr.
Stanhope
very
sternly
but
not
now
very
loudly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
'll
trouble
you
to
sit
down
,
too
,
Charlotte
.
<EOS>
Your
mother
can
wait
for
her
tea
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Charlotte
sat
down
on
the
chair
nearest
to
the
door
in
somewhat
of
a
perverse
sort
of
manner
,
as
much
as
though
she
would
say
 
"
Well
,
here
I
am
;
you
sha
n't
say
I
do
n't
do
what
I
am
bid
;
but
I
'll
be
whipped
if
I
give
way
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
was
determined
not
to
give
way
.
<EOS>
She
too
was
angry
with
Bertie
,
but
she
was
not
the
less
ready
on
that
account
to
defend
him
from
his
father
.
<EOS>
Bertie
also
sat
down
.
<EOS>
He
drew
his
chair
close
to
the
library
-
table
,
upon
which
he
put
his
elbow
,
and
then
resting
his
face
comfortably
on
one
hand
,
he
began
drawing
little
pictures
on
a
sheet
of
paper
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
Before
the
scene
was
over
he
had
completed
admirable
figures
of
Miss
Thorne
,
Mrs.
Proudie
,
and
Lady
De
Courcy
,
and
begun
a
family
piece
to
comprise
the
whole
set
of
the
Lookalofts
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
it
suit
you
,
sir
,
"
said
the
father
,
"
to
give
me
some
idea
as
to
what
your
present
intentions
are
?
<EOS>
What
way
of
living
you
propose
to
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
do
anything
you
can
suggest
,
sir
,
"
replied
Bertie
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
shall
suggest
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
My
time
for
suggesting
has
gone
by
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
one
order
to
give
,
and
that
is
that
you
leave
my
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
-
night
?
"
said
Bertie
,
and
the
simple
tone
of
the
question
left
the
doctor
without
any
adequately
dignified
method
of
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
does
not
quite
mean
to
-
night
,
"
said
Charlotte
;
"
at
least
I
suppose
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
-
morrow
,
perhaps
,
"
suggested
Bertie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
leave
this
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Will
the
4.30
P.M.
train
be
soon
enough
?
"
<EOS>
and
Bertie
,
as
he
asked
,
put
the
finishing
touch
to
Miss
Thorne
's
high
-
heeled
boots
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
go
how
and
when
and
where
you
please
,
so
that
you
leave
my
house
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
You
have
disgraced
me
,
sir
;
you
have
disgraced
yourself
,
and
me
,
and
your
sisters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
at
least
,
sir
,
that
I
have
not
disgraced
my
mother
,
"
said
Bertie
.
  
<EOS>
Charlotte
could
hardly
keep
her
countenance
,
but
the
doctor
's
brow
grew
still
blacker
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Bertie
was
executing
his
_
chef
d'oeuvre
_
in
the
delineation
of
Mrs.
Proudie
's
nose
and
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
heartless
reprobate
,
sir
;
a
heartless
,
thankless
,
good
-
for
-
nothing
reprobate
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
my
son
 
that
I
can
not
help
 
<EOS>
but
you
shall
have
no
more
part
or
parcel
in
me
as
my
child
,
nor
I
in
you
as
your
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Papa
,
Papa
!
<EOS>
You
must
not
,
shall
not
say
so
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
say
so
,
and
do
say
so
,
"
said
the
father
,
rising
from
his
chair
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
leave
the
room
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Stop
,
stop
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
speak
,
Bertie
?
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
look
up
and
speak
?
<EOS>
It
is
your
manner
that
makes
Papa
so
angry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
perfectly
indifferent
to
all
decency
,
to
all
propriety
,
"
said
the
doctor
;
then
he
shouted
out
,
"
Leave
the
room
,
sir
!
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
what
I
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Papa
,
Papa
,
I
will
not
let
you
part
so
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
be
sorry
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
then
she
added
,
getting
up
and
whispering
into
his
ear
,
"
Is
he
only
to
blame
?
<EOS>
Think
of
that
.
<EOS>
We
have
made
our
own
bed
,
and
,
such
as
it
is
,
we
must
lie
on
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
no
use
for
us
to
quarrel
among
ourselves
,
"
and
as
she
finished
her
whisper
,
Bertie
finished
off
the
countess
's
bustle
,
which
was
so
well
done
that
it
absolutely
seemed
to
be
swaying
to
and
fro
on
the
paper
with
its
usual
lateral
motion
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
is
angry
at
the
present
time
,
"
said
Bertie
,
looking
up
for
a
moment
from
his
sketches
,
"
because
I
am
not
going
to
marry
Mrs.
Bold
.
<EOS>
What
can
I
say
on
the
matter
?
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
I
am
not
going
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
 
"
  
"
That
is
not
true
,
sir
,
"
said
Dr.
Stanhope
,
"
but
I
will
not
argue
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
angry
just
this
moment
because
I
would
not
speak
,
"
said
Bertie
,
going
on
with
a
young
Lookaloft
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
over
drawing
,
"
said
Charlotte
,
going
up
to
him
and
taking
the
paper
from
under
his
hand
.
<EOS>
The
caricatures
,
however
,
she
preserved
and
showed
them
afterwards
to
the
friends
of
the
Thornes
,
the
Proudies
,
and
De
Courcys
.
<EOS>
Bertie
,
deprived
of
his
occupation
,
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
waited
further
orders
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
will
certainly
be
for
the
best
that
Bertie
should
leave
this
at
once
;
perhaps
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Charlotte
;
"
but
pray
,
Papa
,
let
us
arrange
some
scheme
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
will
leave
this
to
-
morrow
,
I
will
give
him
£
10
,
and
he
shall
be
paid
£
5
a
month
by
the
banker
at
Carrara
as
long
as
he
stays
permanently
in
that
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
it
wo
n't
be
long
,
"
said
Bertie
,
"
for
I
shall
be
starved
to
death
in
about
three
months
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
must
have
marble
to
work
with
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
plenty
there
in
the
studio
to
last
me
three
months
,
"
said
Bertie
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
no
use
attempting
anything
large
in
so
limited
a
time
 
unless
I
do
my
own
tombstone
.
"
  
<EOS>
Terms
,
however
,
were
ultimately
come
to
somewhat
more
liberal
than
those
proposed
,
and
the
doctor
was
induced
to
shake
hands
with
his
son
and
bid
him
good
night
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Stanhope
would
not
go
up
to
tea
,
but
had
it
brought
to
him
in
his
study
by
his
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
But
Bertie
went
upstairs
and
spent
a
pleasant
evening
.
<EOS>
He
finished
the
Lookalofts
,
greatly
to
the
delight
of
his
sisters
,
though
the
manner
of
portraying
their
_
décolleté
_
dresses
was
not
the
most
refined
.
<EOS>
Finding
how
matters
were
going
,
he
by
degrees
allowed
it
to
escape
from
him
that
he
had
not
pressed
his
suit
upon
the
widow
in
a
very
urgent
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
in
point
of
fact
,
you
never
proposed
at
all
?
"
said
Charlotte
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
she
understood
that
she
might
have
me
if
she
wished
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
she
did
n't
wish
,
"
said
the
Signora
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
thrown
me
over
in
the
most
shameful
manner
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
told
her
all
about
my
little
plan
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
came
out
somehow
 
at
least
the
most
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
an
end
of
that
alliance
,
"
said
Charlotte
,
"
but
it
does
n't
matter
much
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
shall
all
be
back
at
Como
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
hope
so
,
"
said
the
signora
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sick
of
the
sight
of
black
coats
.
<EOS>
If
that
Mr.
Slope
comes
here
any
more
,
he
'll
be
the
death
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
been
the
ruin
of
him
,
I
think
,
"
said
Charlotte
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
as
for
a
second
black
-
coated
lover
of
mine
,
I
am
going
to
make
a
present
of
him
to
another
lady
with
most
singular
disinterestedness
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
,
true
to
his
promise
,
Bertie
packed
up
and
went
off
by
the
4.30
P.M.
train
,
with
£
20
in
his
pocket
,
bound
for
the
marble
quarries
of
Carrara
.
<EOS>
And
so
he
disappears
from
our
scene
.
  
<EOS>
At
twelve
o'clock
on
the
day
following
that
on
which
Bertie
went
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
true
also
to
her
word
,
knocked
at
Dr.
Stanhope
's
door
with
a
timid
hand
and
palpitating
heart
.
<EOS>
She
was
at
once
shown
up
to
the
back
drawing
-
room
,
the
folding
doors
of
which
were
closed
,
so
that
in
visiting
the
signora
Eleanor
was
not
necessarily
thrown
into
any
communion
with
those
in
the
front
room
.
<EOS>
As
she
went
up
the
stairs
,
she
saw
none
of
the
family
and
was
so
far
saved
much
of
the
annoyance
which
she
had
dreaded
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
very
kind
of
you
,
Mrs.
Bold
;
very
kind
,
after
what
has
happened
,
"
said
the
lady
on
the
sofa
with
her
sweetest
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wrote
in
such
a
strain
that
I
could
not
but
come
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
I
did
;
I
wanted
to
force
you
to
see
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
signora
,
I
am
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
cold
you
are
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
suppose
I
must
put
up
with
that
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
think
you
have
reason
to
be
displeased
with
us
all
.
<EOS>
Poor
Bertie
;
if
you
knew
all
,
you
would
not
be
angry
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
angry
with
your
brother
 
not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
But
I
hope
you
did
not
send
for
me
here
to
talk
about
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
angry
with
Charlotte
,
that
is
worse
,
for
you
have
no
warmer
friend
in
all
Barchester
.
<EOS>
But
I
did
not
send
for
you
to
talk
about
this
 
pray
<EOS>
bring
your
chair
nearer
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
so
that
I
may
look
at
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
unnatural
to
see
you
keeping
so
far
off
from
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
did
as
she
was
bid
and
brought
her
chair
close
to
the
sofa
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
I
am
going
to
tell
you
something
which
you
may
perhaps
think
indelicate
,
but
yet
I
know
that
I
am
right
in
doing
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hereupon
Mrs.
Bold
said
nothing
but
felt
inclined
to
shake
in
her
chair
.
<EOS>
The
signora
,
she
knew
,
was
not
very
particular
,
and
that
which
to
her
appeared
to
be
indelicate
might
to
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
appear
to
be
extremely
indecent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
know
Mr.
Arabin
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
would
have
given
the
world
not
to
blush
,
but
her
blood
was
not
at
her
own
command
.
<EOS>
She
did
blush
up
to
her
forehead
,
and
the
signora
,
who
had
made
her
sit
in
a
special
light
in
order
that
she
might
watch
her
,
saw
that
she
did
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
acquainted
with
him
.
<EOS>
That
is
,
slightly
.
<EOS>
He
is
an
intimate
friend
of
Dr.
Grantly
,
and
Dr.
Grantly
is
my
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
you
know
Mr.
Arabin
,
I
am
sure
you
must
like
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
and
like
him
much
.
<EOS>
Everybody
that
knows
him
must
like
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
felt
it
quite
impossible
to
say
anything
in
reply
to
this
.
<EOS>
Her
blood
was
rushing
about
her
body
<EOS>
she
knew
not
how
or
why
.
<EOS>
She
felt
as
though
she
were
swinging
in
her
chair
,
and
she
knew
that
she
was
not
only
red
in
the
face
but
also
almost
suffocated
with
heat
.
<EOS>
However
,
she
sat
still
and
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
stiff
you
are
with
me
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
"
said
the
signora
;
"
and
I
the
while
am
doing
for
you
all
that
one
woman
can
do
to
serve
another
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
kind
of
thought
came
over
the
widow
's
mind
that
perhaps
the
signora
's
friendship
was
real
,
and
that
at
any
rate
it
could
not
hurt
her
;
and
another
kind
of
thought
,
a
glimmering
of
a
thought
,
came
to
her
also
 
that
Mr.
Arabin
was
too
precious
to
be
lost
.
<EOS>
She
despised
the
signora
,
but
might
she
not
stoop
to
conquer
?
<EOS>
It
should
be
but
the
smallest
fraction
of
a
stoop
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
be
stiff
,
"
she
said
,
"
but
your
questions
are
so
very
singular
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
I
will
ask
you
one
more
singular
still
,
"
said
Madeline
Neroni
,
raising
herself
on
her
elbow
and
turning
her
own
face
full
upon
her
companion
's
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
love
him
,
love
him
with
all
your
heart
and
soul
,
with
all
the
love
your
bosom
can
feel
?
<EOS>
For
I
can
tell
you
that
he
loves
you
,
adores
you
,
worships
you
,
thinks
of
you
and
nothing
else
,
is
now
thinking
of
you
as
he
attempts
to
write
his
sermon
for
next
Sunday
's
preaching
.
<EOS>
What
would
I
not
give
to
be
loved
in
such
a
way
by
such
a
man
,
that
is
,
if
I
were
an
object
fit
for
any
man
to
love
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
got
up
from
her
seat
and
stood
speechless
before
the
woman
who
was
now
addressing
her
in
this
impassioned
way
.
<EOS>
When
the
signora
thus
alluded
to
herself
,
the
widow
's
heart
was
softened
,
and
she
put
her
own
hand
,
as
though
caressingly
,
on
that
of
her
companion
,
which
was
resting
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
The
signora
grasped
it
and
went
on
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
tell
you
is
God
's
own
truth
;
and
it
is
for
you
to
use
it
as
may
be
best
for
your
own
happiness
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
not
betray
me
.
<EOS>
He
knows
nothing
of
this
.
<EOS>
He
knows
nothing
of
my
knowing
his
inmost
heart
.
<EOS>
He
is
simple
as
a
child
in
these
matters
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
his
secret
in
a
thousand
ways
because
he
could
not
dissemble
,
but
he
does
not
dream
that
he
has
told
it
.
<EOS>
You
know
it
now
,
and
I
advise
you
to
use
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
returned
the
pressure
of
the
other
's
hand
with
an
infinitesimal
_
soupçon
_
of
a
squeeze
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
remember
,
"
continued
the
signora
,
"
he
is
not
like
other
men
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
expect
him
to
come
to
you
with
vows
and
oaths
and
pretty
presents
,
to
kneel
at
your
feet
,
and
kiss
your
shoe
-
strings
.
<EOS>
If
you
want
that
,
there
are
plenty
to
do
it
,
but
he
wo
n't
be
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
's
bosom
nearly
burst
with
a
sigh
,
but
Madeline
,
not
heeding
her
,
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
him
,
yea
will
stand
for
yea
,
and
nay
for
nay
.
<EOS>
Though
his
heart
should
break
for
it
,
the
woman
who
shall
reject
him
once
will
have
rejected
him
once
and
for
all
.
<EOS>
Remember
that
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
I
will
not
keep
you
,
for
you
are
fluttered
.
<EOS>
I
partly
guess
what
use
you
will
make
of
what
I
have
said
to
you
.
<EOS>
If
ever
you
are
a
happy
wife
in
that
man
's
house
,
we
shall
be
far
away
,
but
I
shall
expect
you
to
write
me
one
line
to
say
that
you
have
forgiven
the
sins
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
half
-
whispered
that
she
would
,
and
then
,
without
uttering
another
word
,
crept
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
stairs
,
opened
the
front
door
for
herself
without
hearing
or
seeing
anyone
,
and
found
herself
in
the
close
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
to
analyse
Eleanor
's
feelings
as
she
walked
home
.
<EOS>
She
was
nearly
stupefied
by
the
things
that
had
been
said
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
felt
sore
that
her
heart
should
have
been
so
searched
and
riddled
by
a
comparative
stranger
,
by
a
woman
whom
she
had
never
liked
and
never
could
like
.
<EOS>
She
was
mortified
that
the
man
whom
she
owned
to
herself
that
she
loved
should
have
concealed
his
love
from
her
and
shown
it
to
another
.
<EOS>
There
was
much
to
vex
her
proud
spirit
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
,
nevertheless
,
an
under
stratum
of
joy
in
all
this
which
buoyed
her
up
wondrously
.
<EOS>
She
tried
if
she
could
disbelieve
what
Madame
Neroni
had
said
to
her
,
but
she
found
that
she
could
not
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
;
it
must
be
true
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
,
would
not
,
did
not
doubt
it
.
  
<EOS>
On
one
point
she
fully
resolved
to
follow
the
advice
given
her
.
<EOS>
If
it
should
ever
please
Mr.
Arabin
to
put
such
a
question
to
her
as
that
suggested
,
her
"
yea
"
should
be
"
yea
.
"
<EOS>
Would
not
all
her
miseries
be
at
an
end
if
she
could
talk
of
them
to
him
openly
,
with
her
head
resting
on
his
shoulder
?
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
's
Parting
Interview
with
the
Signora
 
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
the
signora
was
in
her
pride
.
<EOS>
She
was
dressed
in
her
brightest
of
morning
dresses
,
and
had
quite
a
levée
round
her
couch
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
beautifully
bright
October
afternoon
;
all
the
gentlemen
of
the
neighbourhood
were
in
Barchester
,
and
those
who
had
the
entry
of
Dr.
Stanhope
's
house
were
in
the
signora
's
back
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
and
Mrs.
Stanhope
were
in
the
front
room
,
and
such
of
the
lady
's
squires
as
could
not
for
the
moment
get
near
the
centre
of
attraction
had
to
waste
their
fragrance
on
the
mother
and
sister
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
who
came
and
the
last
to
leave
was
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
second
visit
he
had
paid
to
Madame
Neroni
since
he
had
met
her
at
Ullathorne
.
<EOS>
He
came
,
he
knew
not
why
,
to
talk
about
,
he
knew
not
what
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
truth
,
the
feelings
which
now
troubled
him
were
new
to
him
,
and
he
could
not
analyse
them
.
<EOS>
It
may
seem
strange
that
he
should
thus
come
dangling
about
Madame
Neroni
because
he
was
in
love
with
Mrs.
Bold
;
but
it
was
nevertheless
the
fact
;
and
though
he
could
not
understand
why
he
did
so
,
Madame
Neroni
understood
it
well
enough
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
been
gentle
and
kind
to
him
and
had
encouraged
his
staying
.
<EOS>
Therefore
he
stayed
on
.
<EOS>
She
pressed
his
hand
when
he
first
greeted
her
;
she
made
him
remain
near
her
and
whispered
to
him
little
nothings
.
<EOS>
And
then
her
eye
,
brilliant
and
bright
,
now
mirthful
,
now
melancholy
,
and
invincible
in
either
way
!
<EOS>
What
man
with
warm
feelings
,
blood
unchilled
,
and
a
heart
not
guarded
by
a
triple
steel
of
experience
could
have
withstood
those
eyes
!
<EOS>
The
lady
,
it
is
true
,
intended
to
do
him
no
mortal
injury
;
she
merely
chose
to
inhale
a
slight
breath
of
incense
before
she
handed
the
casket
over
to
another
.
<EOS>
Whether
Mrs.
Bold
would
willingly
have
spared
even
so
much
is
another
question
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
came
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
All
the
world
now
knew
that
Mr.
Slope
was
a
candidate
for
the
deanery
and
that
he
was
generally
considered
to
be
the
favourite
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
therefore
,
walked
rather
largely
upon
the
earth
.
<EOS>
He
gave
to
himself
a
portly
air
,
such
as
might
become
a
dean
,
spoke
but
little
to
other
clergymen
,
and
shunned
the
bishop
as
much
as
possible
.
<EOS>
How
the
meagre
little
prebendary
,
and
the
burly
chancellor
,
and
all
the
minor
canons
and
vicars
choral
,
ay
,
and
all
the
choristers
,
too
,
cowered
and
shook
and
walked
about
with
long
faces
when
they
read
or
heard
of
that
article
in
"
The
Jupiter
.
<EOS>
"
Now
were
coming
the
days
when
nothing
would
avail
to
keep
the
impure
spirit
from
the
cathedral
pulpit
.
<EOS>
That
pulpit
would
indeed
be
his
own
.
<EOS>
Precentors
,
vicars
,
and
choristers
might
hang
up
their
harps
on
the
willows
.
<EOS>
Ichabod
!
<EOS>
Ichabod
!
<EOS>
The
glory
of
their
house
was
departing
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
great
as
he
was
with
embryo
grandeur
,
still
came
to
see
the
signora
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
could
not
keep
himself
away
.
<EOS>
He
dreamed
of
that
soft
hand
which
he
had
kissed
so
often
,
and
of
that
imperial
brow
which
his
lips
had
once
pressed
;
and
he
then
dreamed
also
of
further
favours
.
  
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Thorne
was
there
also
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
visit
he
had
ever
paid
to
the
signora
,
and
he
made
it
not
without
due
preparation
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
was
a
gentleman
usually
precise
in
his
dress
and
prone
to
make
the
most
of
himself
in
an
unpretending
way
.
<EOS>
The
grey
hairs
in
his
whiskers
were
eliminated
perhaps
once
a
month
;
those
on
his
head
were
softened
by
a
mixture
which
we
will
not
call
a
dye
 
<EOS>
it
was
only
a
wash
.
<EOS>
His
tailor
lived
in
St.
James
's
Street
,
and
his
bootmaker
at
the
corner
of
that
street
and
Piccadilly
.
<EOS>
He
was
particular
in
the
article
of
gloves
,
and
the
getting
up
of
his
shirts
was
a
matter
not
lightly
thought
of
in
the
Ullathorne
laundry
.
<EOS>
On
the
occasion
of
the
present
visit
he
had
rather
overdone
his
usual
efforts
,
and
caused
some
little
uneasiness
to
his
sister
,
who
had
not
hitherto
received
very
cordially
the
proposition
for
a
lengthened
visit
from
the
signora
at
Ullathorne
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
others
also
there
 
young
men
about
the
city
who
had
not
much
to
do
and
who
were
induced
by
the
lady
's
charms
to
neglect
that
little
 
but
all
gave
way
to
Mr.
Thorne
,
who
was
somewhat
of
a
grand
signor
,
as
a
country
gentleman
always
is
in
a
provincial
city
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Thorne
,
this
is
so
kind
of
you
!
"
said
the
signora
.
<EOS>
"
You
promised
to
come
,
but
I
really
did
not
expect
it
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
country
gentlemen
never
kept
your
pledges
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
sometimes
,
"
said
Mr.
Thorne
,
looking
rather
sheepish
and
making
his
salutations
a
little
too
much
in
the
style
of
the
last
century
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
deceive
none
but
your
consti
 
stit
 
stit
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
call
the
people
that
carry
you
about
in
chairs
and
pelt
you
with
eggs
and
apples
when
they
make
you
a
member
of
Parliament
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
another
also
,
sometimes
,
signora
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
with
a
very
deanish
sort
of
smirk
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Country
gentlemen
do
deceive
one
another
sometimes
,
do
n't
they
,
Mr.
Thorne
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
gave
him
a
look
which
undeaned
him
completely
for
the
moment
,
but
he
soon
remembered
his
high
hopes
and
,
recovering
himself
quickly
,
sustained
his
probable
coming
dignity
by
a
laugh
at
Mr.
Thorne
's
expense
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
deceive
a
lady
,
at
any
rate
,
"
said
Mr.
Thorne
,
"
especially
when
the
gratification
of
my
own
wishes
is
so
strong
an
inducement
to
keep
me
true
,
as
it
now
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
went
on
thus
awhile
with
antediluvian
grimaces
and
compliments
which
he
had
picked
up
from
Sir
Charles
Grandison
,
and
the
signora
at
every
grimace
and
at
every
bow
smiled
a
little
smile
and
bowed
a
little
bow
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
,
however
,
was
kept
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
couch
,
for
the
new
dean
sat
in
the
seat
of
honour
near
the
table
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
the
while
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
his
coat
-
tails
under
his
arms
,
gazing
at
her
with
all
his
eyes
 
not
quite
in
vain
,
for
every
now
and
again
<EOS>
a
glance
came
up
at
him
,
bright
as
a
meteor
out
of
heaven
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Thorne
,
you
promised
to
let
me
introduce
my
little
girl
to
you
.
<EOS>
Can
you
spare
a
moment
 
<EOS>
will
you
see
her
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
assured
her
that
he
could
and
would
see
the
young
lady
with
the
greatest
pleasure
in
life
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
might
I
trouble
you
to
ring
the
bell
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
and
when
Mr.
Slope
got
up
,
she
looked
at
Mr.
Thorne
and
pointed
to
the
chair
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
,
however
,
was
much
too
slow
to
understand
her
,
and
Mr.
Slope
would
have
recovered
his
seat
had
not
the
signora
,
who
never
chose
to
be
unsuccessful
,
somewhat
summarily
ordered
him
out
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Slope
,
I
must
ask
you
to
let
Mr.
Thorne
sit
here
just
for
a
moment
or
two
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
will
pardon
me
.
<EOS>
We
can
take
a
liberty
with
you
this
week
.
<EOS>
Next
week
,
you
know
,
when
you
move
into
the
dean
's
house
,
we
shall
all
be
afraid
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
with
an
air
of
much
indifference
,
rose
from
his
seat
and
,
walking
into
the
next
room
,
became
greatly
interested
in
Mrs.
Stanhope
's
worsted
work
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
the
child
was
brought
in
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
little
girl
,
about
eight
years
of
age
,
like
her
mother
,
only
that
her
enormous
eyes
were
black
,
and
her
hair
quite
jet
.
<EOS>
Her
complexion
,
too
,
was
very
dark
and
bespoke
her
foreign
blood
.
<EOS>
She
was
dressed
in
the
most
outlandish
and
extravagant
way
in
which
clothes
could
be
put
on
a
child
's
back
.
<EOS>
She
had
great
bracelets
on
her
naked
little
arms
,
a
crimson
fillet
braided
with
gold
round
her
head
,
and
scarlet
shoes
with
high
heels
.
<EOS>
Her
dress
was
all
flounces
and
stuck
out
from
her
as
though
the
object
were
to
make
it
lie
off
horizontally
from
her
little
hips
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
nearly
cover
her
knees
,
but
this
was
atoned
for
by
a
loose
pair
of
drawers
,
which
seemed
made
throughout
of
lace
;
then
she
had
on
pink
silk
stockings
.
<EOS>
It
was
thus
that
the
last
of
the
Neros
was
habitually
dressed
at
the
hour
when
visitors
were
wo
nt
to
call
.
  
<EOS>
"
Julia
,
my
love
,
"
said
the
mother
 
Julia
was
ever
a
favourite
name
with
the
ladies
of
that
family
.
<EOS>
"
Julia
,
my
love
,
come
here
.
<EOS>
I
was
telling
you
about
the
beautiful
party
poor
Mamma
<EOS>
went
to
.
<EOS>
This
is
Mr.
Thorne
;
will
you
give
him
a
kiss
,
dearest
?
"
  
<EOS>
Julia
put
up
her
face
to
be
kissed
,
as
she
did
to
all
her
mother
's
visitors
,
and
then
Mr.
Thorne
found
that
he
had
got
her
and
,
what
was
much
more
terrific
to
him
,
all
her
finery
,
into
his
arms
.
<EOS>
The
lace
and
starch
crumpled
against
his
waistcoat
and
trousers
,
the
greasy
black
curls
hung
upon
his
cheek
,
and
one
of
the
bracelet
clasps
scratched
his
ear
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
at
all
know
how
to
hold
so
magnificent
a
lady
,
nor
holding
her
what
to
do
with
her
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
had
on
other
occasions
been
compelled
to
fondle
little
nieces
and
nephews
,
and
now
set
about
the
task
in
the
mode
he
always
had
used
.
  
<EOS>
"
Diddle
,
diddle
,
diddle
,
diddle
,
"
said
he
,
putting
the
child
on
one
knee
and
working
away
with
it
as
though
he
were
turning
a
knife
-
grinder
's
wheel
with
his
foot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma
,
Mamma
,
"
said
Julia
crossly
,
"
I
do
n't
want
to
be
diddle
diddled
.
<EOS>
Let
me
go
,
you
naughty
old
man
,
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Thorne
put
the
child
down
quietly
on
the
ground
and
drew
back
his
chair
;
Mr.
Slope
,
who
had
returned
to
the
pole
star
that
attracted
him
,
laughed
aloud
;
Mr.
Arabin
winced
and
shut
his
eyes
;
and
the
signora
pretended
not
to
hear
her
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
to
Aunt
Charlotte
,
lovey
,
"
said
the
mamma
,
"
and
ask
her
if
it
is
not
time
for
you
to
go
out

<EOS>
But
little
Miss
Julia
,
though
she
had
not
exactly
liked
the
nature
of
Mr.
Thorne
's
attention
,
was
accustomed
to
be
played
with
by
gentlemen
,
and
did
not
relish
the
idea
of
being
sent
so
soon
to
her
aunt
.
  
<EOS>
"
Julia
,
go
when
I
tell
you
,
my
dear
.
"
<EOS>
But
Julia
still
went
pouting
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
Charlotte
,
do
come
and
take
her
,
"
said
the
signora
.
<EOS>
"
She
must
go
out
,
and
the
days
get
so
short
now
.
"
<EOS>
And
thus
ended
the
much
-
talked
-
of
interview
between
Mr.
Thorne
and
the
last
of
the
Neros
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
recovered
from
the
child
's
crossness
sooner
than
from
Mr.
Slope
's
laughter
.
<EOS>
He
could
put
up
with
being
called
an
old
man
by
an
infant
,
but
he
did
not
like
to
be
laughed
at
by
the
bishop
's
chaplain
,
even
though
that
chaplain
was
about
to
become
a
dean
.
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
,
but
he
showed
plainly
enough
that
he
was
angry
.
  
<EOS>
The
signora
was
ready
enough
to
avenge
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
hear
that
you
are
triumphing
on
all
sides
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
so
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
dislike
being
talked
to
about
the
deanery
,
though
,
of
course
,
he
strongly
denied
the
imputation
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
carry
the
day
both
in
love
and
war
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
hereupon
did
not
look
quite
so
satisfied
as
he
had
done
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Arabin
,
"
continued
the
signora
,
"
do
n't
you
think
Mr.
Slope
is
a
very
lucky
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
more
so
than
he
deserves
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
think
,
Mr.
Thorne
,
he
is
to
be
our
new
dean
;
of
course
we
all
know
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
signora
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
"
we
all
know
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
assure
you
I
myself
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
is
to
be
the
new
dean
 
<EOS>
there
is
no
manner
of
doubt
of
it
,
Mr.
Thorne
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Hum
!
"
said
Mr.
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
"
Passing
over
the
heads
of
old
men
like
my
father
and
Archdeacon
Grantly
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
 
oh
!
"
said
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
archdeacon
would
not
accept
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Arabin
,
whereupon
Mr.
Slope
smiled
abominably
and
said
,
as
plainly
as
a
look
could
speak
,
that
the
grapes
were
sour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Going
over
all
our
heads
,
"
continued
the
signora
,
"
for
of
course
I
consider
myself
one
of
the
chapter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
If
I
am
ever
dean
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
"
that
is
,
were
I
ever
to
become
so
<EOS>
,
I
should
glory
in
such
a
canoness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Slope
,
stop
;
I
have
n't
half
done
.
<EOS>
There
is
another
canoness
for
you
to
glory
in
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
is
not
only
to
have
the
deanery
but
a
wife
to
put
in
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
again
looked
disconcerted
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
wife
with
a
large
fortune
,
too
.
<EOS>
It
never
rains
but
it
pours
,
does
it
,
Mr.
Thorne
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
never
,
"
said
Mr.
Thorne
,
who
did
not
quite
relish
talking
about
Mr.
Slope
and
his
affairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
will
it
be
,
Mr.
Slope
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
will
what
be
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
we
know
when
the
affair
of
the
dean
will
be
:
a
week
will
settle
that
.
<EOS>
The
new
hat
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
has
been
already
ordered
.
<EOS>
But
when
will
the
marriage
come
off
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
mine
or
Mr.
Arabin
's
?
"
said
he
,
striving
to
be
facetious
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
just
then
I
meant
yours
,
though
,
perhaps
,
after
all
,
Mr.
Arabin
's
may
be
first
.
<EOS>
But
we
know
nothing
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
too
close
for
any
of
us
.
<EOS>
Now
all
is
open
and
above
board
with
you
 
<EOS>
which
,
by
the
by
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
I
beg
to
tell
you
I
like
much
the
best
.
<EOS>
He
who
runs
can
read
that
Mr.
Slope
is
a
favoured
lover
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Mr.
Slope
,
when
is
the
widow
to
be
made
Mrs.
Dean
?
"
  
<EOS>
To
Mr.
Arabin
<EOS>
this
badinage
was
peculiarly
painful
,
and
yet
he
could
not
tear
himself
away
and
leave
it
.
<EOS>
He
believed
,
still
believed
with
that
sort
of
belief
which
the
fear
of
a
thing
engenders
,
that
Mrs.
Bold
would
probably
become
the
wife
of
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Of
Mr.
Slope
's
little
adventure
in
the
garden
he
knew
nothing
.
<EOS>
For
aught
he
knew
,
Mr.
Slope
might
have
had
an
adventure
of
quite
a
different
character
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
thrown
himself
at
the
widow
's
feet
,
been
accepted
,
and
then
returned
to
town
a
jolly
,
thriving
wooer
.
<EOS>
The
signora
's
jokes
were
bitter
enough
to
Mr.
Slope
,
but
they
were
quite
as
bitter
to
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
He
still
stood
leaning
against
the
fire
-
place
,
fumbling
with
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
Mr.
Slope
,
do
n't
be
so
bashful
,
"
continued
the
signora
.
<EOS>
"
We
all
know
that
you
proposed
to
the
lady
the
other
day
at
Ullathorne
.
<EOS>
Tell
us
with
what
words
she
accepted
you
.
<EOS>
Was
it
with
a
simple
"
yes
,
"
or
with
the
two
"
<EOS>
no
<EOS>
no
's
"
which
make
an
affirmative
?
<EOS>
Or
did
silence
give
consent
?
<EOS>
Or
did
she
speak
out
with
that
spirit
which
so
well
becomes
a
widow
and
say
openly
,
"
By
my
troth
,
sir
,
you
shall
make
me
Mrs.
Slope
as
soon
as
it
is
your
pleasure
to
do
so
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Mr.
Slope
had
seldom
in
his
life
felt
himself
less
at
his
ease
.
<EOS>
There
sat
Mr.
Thorne
,
laughing
silently
.
<EOS>
There
stood
his
old
antagonist
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
gazing
at
him
with
all
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
There
round
the
door
between
the
two
rooms
<EOS>
were
clustered
a
little
group
of
people
,
including
Miss
Stanhope
and
the
Revs
.
<EOS>
Messrs.
Grey
and
Green
,
all
listening
to
his
discomfiture
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
it
depended
solely
on
his
own
wit
whether
or
no
he
could
throw
the
joke
back
upon
the
lady
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
it
stood
him
to
do
so
if
he
possibly
could
,
but
he
had
not
a
word
.
"
<EOS>
'
tis
conscience
that
makes
cowards
of
us
all
.
"
<EOS>
He
felt
on
his
cheek
the
sharp
points
of
Eleanor
's
fingers
,
and
did
not
know
who
might
have
seen
the
blow
,
who
might
have
told
the
tale
to
this
pestilent
woman
who
took
such
delight
in
jeering
him
.
<EOS>
He
stood
there
,
therefore
,
red
as
a
carbuncle
and
mute
as
a
fish
;
grinning
sufficiently
to
show
his
teeth
;
an
object
of
pity
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
signora
had
no
pity
;
she
knew
nothing
of
mercy
.
<EOS>
Her
present
object
was
to
put
Mr.
Slope
down
,
and
she
was
determined
to
do
it
thoroughly
,
now
that
she
had
him
in
her
power
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
Mr.
Slope
,
no
answer
?
<EOS>
Why
it
ca
n't
possibly
be
that
the
woman
has
been
fool
enough
to
refuse
you
?
<EOS>
She
ca
n't
surely
be
looking
out
after
a
bishop
.
<EOS>
But
I
see
how
it
is
,
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Widows
are
proverbially
cautious
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
let
her
alone
till
the
new
hat
was
on
your
head
,
till
you
could
show
her
the
key
of
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Signora
,
"
said
he
at
last
,
trying
to
speak
in
a
tone
of
dignified
reproach
,
"
you
really
permit
yourself
to
talk
on
solemn
subjects
in
a
very
improper
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Solemn
subjects
 
what
solemn
subject
?
<EOS>
Surely
a
dean
's
hat
is
not
such
a
solemn
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
aspirations
such
as
those
you
impute
to
me
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
will
drop
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
,
Mr.
Slope
;
but
one
word
first
.
<EOS>
Go
to
her
again
with
the
prime
minister
's
letter
in
your
pocket
.
<EOS>
I
'll
wager
my
shawl
to
your
shovel
she
does
not
refuse
you
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
,
signora
,
that
I
think
you
are
speaking
of
the
lady
in
a
very
unjustifiable
manner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
one
other
piece
of
advice
,
Mr.
Slope
;
I
'll
only
offer
you
one
other
;
"
and
then
she
commenced
singing
    
<EOS>
"
It
's
gude
to
be
merry
and
wise
,
Mr.
Slope
;
It
's
gude
to
be
honest
and
true
;
It
's
gude
to
be
off
with
the
old
love
 
Mr.
Slope
,
Before
you
are
on
with
the
new
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
the
signora
,
throwing
herself
back
on
her
sofa
,
laughed
merrily
.
<EOS>
She
little
recked
how
those
who
heard
her
would
,
in
their
own
imaginations
,
fill
up
the
little
history
of
Mr.
Slope
's
first
love
.
<EOS>
She
little
cared
that
some
among
them
might
attribute
to
her
the
honour
of
his
earlier
admiration
.
<EOS>
She
was
tired
of
Mr.
Slope
and
wanted
to
get
rid
of
him
;
she
had
ground
for
anger
with
him
,
and
she
chose
to
be
revenged
.
  
<EOS>
How
Mr.
Slope
got
out
of
that
room
he
never
himself
knew
.
<EOS>
He
did
succeed
ultimately
,
and
probably
with
some
assistance
,
in
getting
his
hat
and
escaping
into
the
air
.
<EOS>
At
last
his
love
for
the
signora
was
cured
.
<EOS>
Whenever
he
again
thought
of
her
in
his
dreams
,
it
was
not
as
of
an
angel
with
azure
wings
.
<EOS>
He
connected
her
rather
with
fire
and
brimstone
,
and
though
he
could
still
believe
her
to
be
a
spirit
,
he
banished
her
entirely
out
of
heaven
and
found
a
place
for
her
among
the
infernal
gods
.
<EOS>
When
he
weighed
in
the
balance
,
as
he
not
seldom
did
,
the
two
women
to
whom
he
had
attached
himself
in
Barchester
,
the
pre
-
eminent
place
in
his
soul
's
hatred
was
usually
allotted
to
the
signora
.
   
<EOS>
The
Dean
Elect
 
<EOS>
During
the
entire
next
week
Barchester
was
ignorant
who
was
to
be
its
new
dean
.
<EOS>
On
Sunday
morning
Mr.
Slope
was
decidedly
the
favourite
,
but
he
did
not
show
himself
in
the
cathedral
,
and
then
he
sank
a
point
or
two
in
the
betting
.
<EOS>
On
Monday
he
got
a
scolding
from
the
bishop
in
the
hearing
of
the
servants
,
and
down
he
went
till
nobody
would
have
him
at
any
price
;
but
on
Tuesday
he
received
a
letter
,
in
an
official
cover
,
marked
private
,
by
which
he
fully
recovered
his
place
in
the
public
favour
.
<EOS>
On
Wednesday
he
was
said
to
be
ill
,
and
that
did
not
look
well
;
but
on
Thursday
morning
he
went
down
to
the
railway
station
with
a
very
jaunty
air
;
and
when
it
was
ascertained
that
he
had
taken
a
first
-
class
ticket
for
London
,
there
was
no
longer
any
room
for
doubt
on
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
While
matters
were
in
this
state
of
ferment
at
Barchester
,
there
was
not
much
mental
comfort
at
Plumstead
.
<EOS>
Our
friend
the
archdeacon
had
many
grounds
for
inward
grief
.
<EOS>
He
was
much
displeased
at
the
result
of
Dr.
Gwynne
's
diplomatic
mission
to
the
palace
,
and
did
not
even
scruple
to
say
to
his
wife
that
had
he
gone
himself
,
he
would
have
managed
the
affair
much
better
.
<EOS>
His
wife
did
not
agree
with
him
,
but
that
did
not
mend
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Quiverful
's
appointment
to
the
hospital
was
,
however
,
a
_
fait
accompli
_
,
and
Mr.
Harding
's
acquiescence
in
that
appointment
was
not
less
so
.
<EOS>
Nothing
would
induce
Mr.
Harding
to
make
a
public
appeal
against
the
bishop
,
and
the
Master
of
Lazarus
quite
approved
of
his
not
doing
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
has
come
to
the
master
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
over
and
over
again
.
"
<EOS>
He
used
to
be
ready
enough
to
stand
up
for
his
order
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Archdeacon
,
"
Mrs.
Grantly
would
say
in
reply
,
"
what
is
the
use
of
always
fighting
?
<EOS>
I
really
think
the
master
is
right
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
master
,
however
,
had
taken
steps
of
his
own
of
which
neither
the
archdeacon
nor
his
wife
knew
anything
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Slope
's
successes
were
henbane
to
Dr.
Grantly
,
and
Mrs.
Bold
's
improprieties
were
as
bad
.
<EOS>
What
would
be
all
the
world
to
Archdeacon
Grantly
if
Mr.
Slope
should
become
Dean
of
Barchester
and
marry
his
wife
's
sister
!
<EOS>
He
talked
of
it
and
talked
of
it
till
he
was
nearly
ill
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
almost
wished
that
the
marriage
were
done
and
over
,
so
that
she
might
hear
no
more
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
And
there
was
yet
another
ground
of
misery
which
cut
him
to
the
quick
nearly
as
closely
as
either
of
the
others
.
<EOS>
That
paragon
of
a
clergyman
whom
he
had
bestowed
upon
St.
Ewold
's
,
that
college
friend
of
whom
he
had
boasted
so
loudly
,
that
ecclesiastical
knight
before
whose
lance
Mr.
Slope
was
to
fall
and
bite
the
dust
,
that
worthy
bulwark
of
the
church
as
it
should
be
,
that
honoured
representative
of
Oxford
's
best
spirit
,
was
 
so
at
least
his
wife
had
told
him
half
a
dozen
times
 
misconducting
himself
!
  
<EOS>
Nothing
had
been
seen
of
Mr.
Arabin
at
Plumstead
for
the
last
week
,
but
a
good
deal
had
,
unfortunately
,
been
heard
of
him
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Mrs.
Grantly
had
found
herself
alone
with
the
archdeacon
,
on
the
evening
of
the
Ullathorne
party
,
she
had
expressed
herself
very
forcibly
as
to
Mr.
Arabin
's
conduct
on
that
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
she
declared
,
looked
and
acted
and
talked
very
unlike
a
decent
parish
clergyman
.
<EOS>
At
first
the
archdeacon
had
laughed
at
this
,
and
assured
her
that
she
need
not
trouble
herself
 
that
Mr.
Arabin
would
be
found
to
be
quite
safe
.
<EOS>
But
by
degrees
he
began
to
find
that
his
wife
's
eyes
had
been
sharper
than
his
own
.
<EOS>
Other
people
coupled
the
signora
's
name
with
that
of
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
The
meagre
little
prebendary
who
lived
in
the
close
told
him
to
a
nicety
how
often
Mr.
Arabin
had
visited
at
Dr.
Stanhope
's
,
and
how
long
he
had
remained
on
the
occasion
of
each
visit
.
<EOS>
He
had
asked
after
Mr.
Arabin
at
the
cathedral
library
,
and
an
officious
little
vicar
choral
had
offered
to
go
and
see
whether
he
could
be
found
at
Dr.
Stanhope
's
.
<EOS>
Rumour
,
when
she
has
contrived
to
sound
the
first
note
on
her
trumpet
,
soon
makes
a
loud
peal
audible
enough
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
clear
that
Mr.
Arabin
had
succumbed
to
the
Italian
woman
,
and
that
the
archdeacon
's
credit
would
suffer
fearfully
if
something
were
not
done
to
rescue
the
brand
from
the
burning
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
to
give
the
archdeacon
his
due
,
he
was
really
attached
to
Mr.
Arabin
,
and
grieved
greatly
at
his
backsliding
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
sitting
,
talking
over
their
sorrows
,
in
the
drawing
-
room
before
dinner
on
the
day
after
Mr.
Slope
's
departure
for
London
,
and
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
Mrs.
Grantly
spoke
out
her
mind
freely
.
<EOS>
She
had
opinions
of
her
own
about
parish
clergymen
,
and
now
thought
it
right
to
give
vent
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
would
have
been
led
by
me
,
Archdeacon
,
you
would
never
have
put
a
bachelor
into
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
my
dear
,
you
do
n't
meant
to
say
that
all
bachelor
clergymen
misbehave
themselves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
clergymen
are
so
much
better
than
other
men
,
"
said
Mrs.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
very
well
with
a
curate
,
whom
you
have
under
your
own
eye
and
whom
you
can
get
rid
of
if
he
persists
in
improprieties
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Mr.
Arabin
was
a
fellow
,
and
could
n't
have
had
a
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
would
have
found
someone
who
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
,
are
fellows
never
to
get
livings
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
to
be
sure
they
are
,
when
they
get
engaged
.
<EOS>
I
never
would
put
a
young
man
into
a
living
unless
he
were
married
,
or
engaged
to
be
married
.
<EOS>
Now
,
here
is
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
The
whole
responsibility
lies
upon
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
not
at
this
moment
a
clergyman
in
all
Oxford
more
respected
for
morals
and
conduct
than
Arabin
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Oxford
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
lady
,
with
a
sneer
.
<EOS>
"
What
men
choose
to
do
at
Oxford
nobody
ever
hears
of
.
<EOS>
A
man
may
do
very
well
at
Oxford
who
would
bring
disgrace
on
a
parish
;
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
it
seems
to
me
that
Mr.
Arabin
is
just
such
a
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
groaned
deeply
,
but
he
had
no
further
answer
to
make
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
really
must
speak
to
him
,
Archdeacon
.
<EOS>
Only
think
what
the
Thornes
will
say
if
they
hear
that
their
parish
clergyman
spends
his
whole
time
philandering
with
this
woman
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
groaned
again
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
courageous
man
,
and
knew
well
enough
how
to
rebuke
the
younger
clergymen
of
the
diocese
,
when
necessary
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
that
about
Mr.
Arabin
which
made
the
doctor
feel
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
rebuke
him
with
good
effect
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
advise
him
to
find
a
wife
for
himself
,
and
he
will
understand
well
enough
<EOS>
what
that
means
,
"
said
Mrs.
Grantly
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
had
nothing
for
it
but
groaning
.
<EOS>
There
was
Mr.
Slope
:
he
was
going
to
be
made
dean
;
he
was
going
to
take
a
wife
;
he
was
about
to
achieve
respectability
and
wealth
,
an
excellent
family
mansion
,
and
a
family
carriage
;
he
would
soon
be
among
the
comfortable
_
élite
_
of
the
ecclesiastical
world
of
Barchester
;
whereas
his
own
_
protégé
_
,
<EOS>
the
true
scion
of
the
true
church
,
by
whom
he
had
sworn
,
would
be
still
but
a
poor
vicar
,
and
that
with
a
very
indifferent
character
for
moral
conduct
!
<EOS>
It
might
be
all
very
well
recommending
Mr.
Arabin
to
marry
,
but
how
would
Mr.
Arabin
,
when
married
,
support
a
wife
?
  
<EOS>
Things
were
ordering
themselves
thus
in
Plumstead
drawing
-
room
when
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Grantly
were
disturbed
in
their
sweet
discourse
by
the
quick
rattle
of
a
carriage
and
pair
of
horses
on
the
gravel
sweep
.
<EOS>
The
sound
was
not
that
of
visitors
,
whose
private
carriages
are
generally
brought
up
to
country
-
house
doors
with
demure
propriety
,
but
betokened
rather
the
advent
of
some
person
or
persons
who
were
in
a
hurry
to
reach
the
house
,
and
had
no
intention
of
immediately
leaving
it
.
<EOS>
Guests
invited
to
stay
a
week
,
and
who
were
conscious
of
arriving
after
the
first
dinner
-
bell
,
would
probably
approach
in
such
a
manner
.
<EOS>
So
might
arrive
an
attorney
with
the
news
of
a
granduncle
's
death
,
or
a
son
from
college
with
all
the
fresh
honours
of
a
double
first
.
<EOS>
No
one
would
have
had
himself
driven
up
to
the
door
of
a
country
-
house
in
such
a
manner
who
had
the
slightest
doubt
of
his
own
right
to
force
an
entry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
?
"
said
Mrs.
Grantly
,
looking
at
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
on
earth
can
it
be
?
"
said
the
archdeacon
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
then
quietly
got
up
and
stood
with
the
drawing
-
room
door
open
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
's
your
father
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
indeed
Mr.
Harding
,
and
Mr.
Harding
alone
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
by
himself
in
a
post
-
chaise
with
a
couple
of
horses
from
Barchester
,
arriving
almost
after
dark
,
and
evidently
full
of
news
.
<EOS>
His
visits
had
usually
been
made
in
the
quietest
manner
;
he
had
rarely
presumed
to
come
without
notice
,
and
had
always
been
driven
up
in
a
modest
old
green
fly
,
with
one
horse
,
that
hardly
made
itself
heard
as
it
crawled
up
to
the
hall
-
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
,
Warden
,
is
it
you
?
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
forgetting
in
his
surprise
the
events
of
the
last
few
years
.
<EOS>
"
But
come
in
;
nothing
the
matter
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
very
glad
you
are
come
,
Papa
,
"
said
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
and
get
your
room
ready
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
an't
warden
,
Archdeacon
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
;
"
Mr.
Quiverful
is
warden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
know
,
I
know
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
petulantly
.
<EOS>
"
I
forgot
all
about
it
at
the
moment
.
<EOS>
Is
anything
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
go
this
moment
,
Susan
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
something
to
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
dinner
-
bell
will
ring
in
five
minutes
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
it
?
"
said
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
"
Then
perhaps
I
had
better
wait
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
was
big
with
news
which
he
had
come
to
tell
,
but
which
he
knew
could
not
be
told
without
much
discussion
.
<EOS>
He
had
hurried
away
to
Plumstead
as
fast
as
two
horses
could
bring
him
,
and
now
,
finding
himself
there
,
he
was
willing
to
accept
the
reprieve
which
dinner
would
give
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
anything
of
moment
to
tell
us
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
"
pray
let
us
hear
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
Has
Eleanor
gone
off
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
she
has
not
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
with
a
look
of
great
displeasure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
Slope
been
made
dean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
has
not
,
but
 
"
  
"
But
what
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
who
was
becoming
very
impatient
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
 
"
  
"
They
have
what
?
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
offered
it
to
me
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
,
with
a
modesty
which
almost
prevented
his
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
heavens
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
and
sunk
back
exhausted
in
an
easy
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
dear
father
,
"
said
Mrs.
Grantly
,
and
threw
her
arms
round
her
father
's
neck
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
thought
I
had
better
come
out
and
consult
with
you
at
once
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
Consult
!
"
shouted
the
archdeacon
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
Harding
,
I
congratulate
you
with
my
whole
heart
 
with
my
whole
heart
;
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
never
heard
anything
in
my
life
that
gave
me
so
much
pleasure
;
"
and
he
got
hold
of
both
his
father
-
in
-
law
's
hands
,
and
shook
them
as
though
he
were
going
to
shake
them
off
,
and
walked
round
and
round
the
room
,
twirling
a
copy
of
"
The
Jupiter
"
over
his
head
to
show
his
extreme
exultation
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
 
"
began
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
me
no
buts
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
was
so
happy
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
It
was
just
the
proper
thing
to
do
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
honour
I
'll
never
say
another
word
against
Lord
 
---
the
longest
day
I
have
to
live
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
Dr.
Gwynne
's
doing
,
you
may
be
sure
,
"
said
Mrs.
Grantly
,
who
greatly
liked
the
Master
of
Lazarus
,
he
being
an
orderly
married
man
with
a
large
family
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
is
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Papa
,
I
am
so
truly
delighted
!
"
said
Mrs.
Grantly
,
getting
up
and
kissing
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
in
vain
that
he
strove
to
speak
;
nobody
would
listen
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr.
Dean
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
triumphing
,
"
the
deanery
gardens
will
be
some
consolation
for
the
hospital
elms
.
<EOS>
Well
,
poor
Quiverful
!
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
begrudge
him
his
good
fortune
any
longer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
"
said
Mrs.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Poor
woman
,
she
has
fourteen
children
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
am
very
glad
they
have
got
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
am
I
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
give
twenty
pounds
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
"
to
see
how
Mr.
Slope
will
look
when
he
hears
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
idea
of
Mr.
Slope
's
discomfiture
formed
no
small
part
of
the
archdeacon
's
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
Mr.
Harding
was
allowed
to
go
upstairs
and
wash
his
hands
,
having
,
in
fact
,
said
very
little
of
all
that
he
had
come
out
to
Plumstead
on
purpose
to
say
.
<EOS>
Nor
could
anything
more
be
said
till
the
servants
were
gone
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
The
joy
of
Dr.
Grantly
was
so
uncontrollable
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
calling
his
father
-
in
-
law
Mr.
Dean
before
the
men
,
and
therefore
it
was
soon
matter
of
discussion
in
the
lower
regions
how
Mr.
Harding
,
instead
of
his
daughter
's
future
husband
,
was
to
be
the
new
dean
,
and
various
were
the
opinions
on
the
matter
.
<EOS>
The
cook
and
butler
,
who
were
advanced
in
years
,
thought
that
it
was
just
as
it
should
be
;
but
the
footman
and
lady
's
maid
,
who
were
younger
,
thought
it
was
a
great
shame
that
Mr.
Slope
should
lose
his
chance
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
mean
chap
all
the
same
,
"
said
the
footman
,
"
and
it
an't
along
of
him
that
I
says
so
.
<EOS>
But
I
always
did
admire
the
missus
's
sister
;
and
she
'd
well
become
the
situation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
While
these
were
the
ideas
downstairs
,
a
very
great
difference
of
opinion
existed
above
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
cloth
was
drawn
and
the
wine
on
the
table
,
Mr.
Harding
made
for
himself
an
opportunity
of
speaking
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
however
,
with
much
inward
troubling
that
he
said
:
  
"
It
's
very
kind
of
Lord
 
---
,
very
kind
,
and
I
feel
it
deeply
,
most
deeply
.
<EOS>
I
am
,
I
must
confess
,
gratified
by
the
offer
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
should
think
so
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
all
the
same
I
am
afraid
that
I
ca
n't
accept
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
decanter
almost
fell
from
the
archdeacon
's
hand
upon
the
table
,
and
the
start
he
made
was
so
great
as
to
make
his
wife
jump
up
from
her
chair
.
<EOS>
Not
accept
the
deanship
!
<EOS>
If
it
really
ended
in
this
,
there
would
be
no
longer
any
doubt
that
his
father
-
in
-
law
was
demented
.
<EOS>
The
question
now
was
whether
a
clergyman
with
low
rank
and
preferment
amounting
to
less
than
£
200
a
year
should
accept
high
rank
,
£
1,200
a
year
,
and
one
of
the
most
desirable
positions
which
his
profession
had
to
afford
!
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
gasping
for
breath
and
staring
at
his
guest
as
though
the
violence
of
his
emotion
had
almost
thrown
him
into
a
fit
.
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
find
myself
fit
for
new
duties
,
"
urged
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
New
duties
!
<EOS>
What
duties
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
archdeacon
with
unintended
sarcasm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Papa
,
"
said
Mrs.
Grantly
,
"
nothing
can
be
easier
than
what
a
dean
has
to
do
.
<EOS>
Surely
you
are
more
active
than
Dr.
Trefoil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
wo
n't
have
half
as
much
to
do
<EOS>
as
he
has
at
present
,
"
said
Dr.
Grantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
see
what
"
The
Jupiter
"
said
the
other
day
about
young
men
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
I
saw
that
"
The
Jupiter
"
said
all
that
it
could
to
induce
the
appointment
of
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
would
wish
to
see
Mr.
Slope
made
dean
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
made
no
reply
to
this
rebuke
,
though
he
felt
it
strongly
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
come
over
to
Plumstead
to
have
further
contention
with
his
son
-
in
-
law
about
Mr.
Slope
,
so
he
allowed
it
to
pass
by
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
can
not
make
you
understand
my
feeling
,
"
he
said
,
"
for
we
have
been
cast
in
different
moulds
.
<EOS>
I
may
wish
that
I
had
your
spirit
and
energy
and
power
of
combatting
;
but
I
have
not
.
<EOS>
Every
day
that
is
added
to
my
life
increases
my
wish
for
peace
and
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
where
on
earth
can
a
man
have
peace
and
rest
if
not
in
a
deanery
!
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
People
will
say
that
I
am
too
old
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
heavens
!
<EOS>
People
!
<EOS>
What
people
?
<EOS>
What
need
you
care
for
any
people
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
think
myself
I
am
too
old
for
any
new
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Papa
,
"
said
Mrs.
Grantly
,
"
men
ten
years
older
than
you
are
appointed
to
new
situations
day
after
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
he
,
"
it
is
impossible
that
I
should
make
you
understand
my
feelings
,
nor
do
I
pretend
to
any
great
virtue
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
I
want
the
force
of
character
which
might
enable
me
to
stand
against
the
spirit
of
the
times
.
<EOS>
The
call
on
all
sides
now
is
for
young
men
,
and
I
have
not
the
nerve
to
put
myself
in
opposition
to
the
demand
.
<EOS>
Were
"
The
Jupiter
,
"
<EOS>
when
it
hears
of
my
appointment
,
to
write
article
after
article
setting
forth
my
incompetency
,
I
am
sure
it
would
cost
me
my
reason
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
be
able
to
bear
with
such
things
,
you
will
say
.
<EOS>
Well
,
my
dear
,
I
own
that
I
ought
.
<EOS>
But
I
feel
my
weakness
,
and
I
know
that
I
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
And
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
know
no
more
than
a
child
what
the
dean
has
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pshaw
!
"
exclaimed
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
angry
with
me
,
Archdeacon
<EOS>
:
do
n't
let
us
quarrel
about
it
,
Susan
.
<EOS>
If
you
knew
how
keenly
I
feel
the
necessity
of
having
to
disoblige
you
in
this
matter
,
you
would
not
be
angry
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
dreadful
blow
to
Dr.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
possibly
have
suited
him
better
than
having
Mr.
Harding
in
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
Though
he
had
never
looked
down
on
Mr.
Harding
on
account
of
his
recent
poverty
,
he
did
fully
recognize
the
satisfaction
of
having
those
belonging
to
him
in
comfortable
positions
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
much
more
suitable
that
Mr.
Harding
should
be
Dean
of
Barchester
than
vicar
of
St.
Cuthbert
's
and
precentor
to
boot
.
<EOS>
And
then
the
great
discomfiture
of
that
arch
-
enemy
of
all
that
was
respectable
in
Barchester
,
of
that
new
Low
Church
clerical
parvenu
that
had
fallen
amongst
them
,
that
alone
would
be
worth
more
,
almost
,
than
the
situation
itself
.
<EOS>
It
was
frightful
to
think
that
such
unhoped
-
for
good
fortune
should
be
marred
by
the
absurd
crotchets
and
unwholesome
hallucinations
by
which
Mr.
Harding
allowed
himself
to
be
led
astray
.
<EOS>
To
have
the
cup
so
near
his
lips
and
then
to
lose
the
drinking
of
it
was
more
than
Dr.
Grantly
could
endure
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
it
appeared
as
though
he
would
have
to
endure
it
.
<EOS>
In
vain
he
threatened
and
in
vain
he
coaxed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
did
not
indeed
speak
with
perfect
decision
of
refusing
the
proffered
glory
,
but
he
would
not
speak
with
anything
like
decision
of
accepting
it
.
<EOS>
When
pressed
again
and
again
,
he
would
again
and
again
allege
that
he
was
wholly
unfitted
to
new
duties
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
that
the
archdeacon
tried
to
insinuate
,
though
he
could
not
plainly
declare
,
that
there
were
no
new
duties
to
perform
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
he
hinted
that
in
all
cases
of
difficulty
he
,
he
the
archdeacon
,
was
willing
and
able
to
guide
a
weak
-
minded
dean
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
seemed
to
have
a
foolish
idea
,
not
only
that
there
were
new
duties
to
do
,
but
that
no
one
should
accept
the
place
who
was
not
himself
prepared
to
do
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
conference
ended
in
an
understanding
that
Mr.
Harding
should
at
once
acknowledge
the
letter
he
had
received
from
the
minister
's
private
secretary
,
and
should
beg
that
he
might
be
allowed
two
days
to
make
up
his
mind
;
and
that
during
those
two
days
the
matter
should
be
considered
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
the
archdeacon
was
to
drive
Mr.
Harding
back
to
Barchester
.

Making
 
<EOS>
On
Mr.
Harding
's
return
to
Barchester
from
Plumstead
,
which
was
effected
by
him
in
due
course
in
company
with
the
archdeacon
,
more
tidings
of
a
surprising
nature
met
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
during
the
journey
,
subjected
to
such
a
weight
of
unanswerable
argument
,
all
of
which
went
to
prove
that
it
was
his
bounden
duty
not
to
interfere
with
the
paternal
Government
that
was
so
anxious
to
make
him
a
dean
,
that
when
he
arrived
at
the
chemist
's
door
in
High
Street
,
he
hardly
knew
which
way
to
turn
himself
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
But
,
perplexed
as
he
was
,
he
was
doomed
to
further
perplexity
.
<EOS>
He
found
a
note
there
from
his
daughter
begging
him
most
urgently
to
come
to
her
immediately
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
again
go
back
a
little
in
our
story
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
had
not
been
slow
to
hear
the
rumours
respecting
Mr.
Arabin
which
had
so
much
disturbed
the
happiness
of
Mrs.
Grantly
.
<EOS>
And
she
,
also
,
was
unhappy
to
think
that
her
parish
clergyman
should
be
accused
of
worshipping
a
strange
goddess
.
<EOS>
She
,
also
,
was
of
opinion
that
rectors
and
vicars
should
all
be
married
,
and
with
that
good
-
natured
energy
which
was
characteristic
of
her
,
she
put
her
wits
to
work
to
find
a
fitting
match
for
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
,
in
this
difficulty
,
could
think
of
no
better
remedy
than
a
lecture
from
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
thought
that
a
young
lady
,
marriageable
and
with
a
dowry
,
might
be
of
more
efficacy
.
<EOS>
In
looking
through
the
catalogue
of
her
unmarried
friends
who
might
possibly
be
in
want
of
a
husband
,
and
might
also
be
fit
for
such
promotion
as
a
country
parsonage
affords
,
she
could
think
of
no
one
more
eligible
than
Mrs.
Bold
;
consequently
,
losing
no
time
,
she
went
into
Barchester
on
the
day
of
Mr.
Slope
's
discomfiture
,
the
same
day
that
her
brother
had
had
his
interesting
interview
with
the
last
of
the
Neros
,
and
invited
Mrs.
Bold
to
bring
her
nurse
and
baby
to
Ullathorne
and
make
them
a
protracted
visit
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
suggested
a
month
or
two
,
intending
to
use
her
influence
afterwards
in
prolonging
it
so
as
to
last
out
the
winter
,
in
order
that
Mr.
Arabin
might
have
an
opportunity
of
becoming
fairly
intimate
with
his
intended
bride
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
have
Mr.
Arabin
,
too
,
"
said
Miss
Thorne
to
herself
;
"
and
before
the
spring
they
'll
know
each
other
;
and
in
twelve
or
eighteen
months
"
time
,
if
all
goes
well
,
Mrs.
Bold
will
be
domiciled
at
St.
Ewold
's
;
"
and
then
the
kind
-
hearted
lady
gave
herself
some
not
undeserved
praise
for
her
match
-
making
genius
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
was
taken
a
little
by
surprise
,
but
the
matter
ended
in
her
promising
to
go
to
Ullathorne
for
at
any
rate
a
week
or
two
;
on
the
day
previous
to
that
on
which
her
father
drove
out
to
Plumstead
,
she
had
had
herself
driven
out
to
Ullathorne
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
would
not
perplex
her
with
her
embryo
lord
on
that
same
evening
,
thinking
that
she
would
allow
her
a
few
hours
to
make
herself
at
home
;
but
on
the
following
morning
Mr.
Arabin
arrived
.
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
said
Miss
Thorne
to
herself
,
"
I
must
contrive
to
throw
them
in
each
other
's
way
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
same
day
,
after
dinner
,
Eleanor
,
with
an
assumed
air
of
dignity
which
she
could
not
maintain
,
with
tears
which
she
could
not
suppress
,
with
a
flutter
which
she
could
not
conquer
,
and
a
joy
which
she
could
not
hide
,
told
Miss
Thorne
that
she
was
engaged
to
marry
Mr.
Arabin
and
that
it
behoved
her
to
get
back
home
to
Barchester
as
quick
as
she
could
.
  
<EOS>
To
say
simply
that
Miss
Thorne
was
rejoiced
at
the
success
of
the
scheme
would
give
a
very
faint
idea
of
her
feelings
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
My
readers
may
probably
have
dreamt
before
now
that
they
have
had
before
them
some
terribly
long
walk
to
accomplish
,
some
journey
of
twenty
or
thirty
miles
,
an
amount
of
labour
frightful
to
anticipate
,
and
that
immediately
on
starting
they
have
ingeniously
found
some
accommodating
short
cut
which
has
brought
them
without
fatigue
to
their
work
's
end
in
five
minutes
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
's
waking
feelings
were
somewhat
of
the
same
nature
.
<EOS>
My
readers
may
perhaps
have
had
to
do
with
children
,
and
may
on
some
occasion
have
promised
to
their
young
charges
some
great
gratification
intended
to
come
off
,
perhaps
at
the
end
of
the
winter
,
or
at
the
beginning
of
summer
.
<EOS>
The
impatient
juveniles
,
however
,
will
not
wait
,
and
clamorously
demand
their
treat
before
they
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
had
a
sort
of
feeling
that
her
children
were
equally
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
She
was
like
an
inexperienced
gunner
,
who
has
ill
-
calculated
the
length
of
the
train
that
he
has
laid
.
<EOS>
The
gun
-
powder
exploded
much
too
soon
,
and
poor
Miss
Thorne
felt
that
she
was
blown
up
by
the
strength
of
her
own
petard
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
had
had
lovers
of
her
own
,
but
they
had
been
gentlemen
of
old
-
fashioned
and
deliberate
habits
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
's
heart
also
had
not
always
been
hard
,
though
she
was
still
a
virgin
spinster
;
but
it
had
never
yielded
in
this
way
at
the
first
assault
.
<EOS>
She
had
intended
to
bring
together
a
middle
-
aged
,
studious
clergyman
and
a
discreet
matron
who
might
possibly
be
induced
to
marry
again
,
and
in
doing
so
she
had
thrown
fire
among
tinder
.
<EOS>
Well
,
it
was
all
as
it
should
be
,
but
she
did
feel
perhaps
a
little
put
out
by
the
precipitancy
of
her
own
success
,
and
perhaps
a
little
vexed
at
the
readiness
of
Mrs.
Bold
to
be
wooed
.
  
<EOS>
She
said
,
however
,
nothing
about
it
to
anyone
,
and
ascribed
it
all
to
the
altered
manners
of
the
new
age
.
<EOS>
Their
mothers
and
grandmothers
were
perhaps
a
little
more
deliberate
,
but
it
was
admitted
on
all
sides
that
things
were
conducted
very
differently
now
than
in
former
times
.
<EOS>
For
aught
Miss
Thorne
knew
of
the
matter
,
a
couple
of
hours
might
be
quite
sufficient
under
the
new
régime
to
complete
that
for
which
she
in
her
ignorance
had
allotted
twelve
months
.
  
<EOS>
But
we
must
not
pass
over
the
wooing
so
cavalierly
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
told
,
with
perhaps
tedious
accuracy
,
how
Eleanor
disposed
of
two
of
her
lovers
at
Ullathorne
;
and
it
must
also
be
told
with
equal
accuracy
,
and
if
possible
with
less
tedium
,
how
she
encountered
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
denied
that
when
Eleanor
accepted
Miss
Thorne
's
invitation
she
remembered
that
Ullathorne
was
in
the
parish
of
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
Since
her
interview
with
the
signora
she
had
done
little
else
than
think
about
Mr.
Arabin
and
the
appeal
that
had
been
made
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
believe
,
or
try
to
bring
herself
to
believe
,
that
what
she
had
been
told
was
untrue
.
<EOS>
Think
of
it
how
she
would
,
she
could
not
but
accept
it
as
a
fact
that
Mr.
Arabin
was
fond
of
her
;
and
then
when
she
went
further
and
asked
herself
the
question
,
she
could
not
but
accept
it
as
a
fact
also
that
she
was
fond
of
him
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
destined
for
her
to
be
the
partner
of
his
hopes
and
sorrows
,
to
whom
could
she
look
for
friendship
so
properly
as
to
Miss
Thorne
?
<EOS>
This
invitation
was
like
an
ordained
step
towards
the
fulfilment
of
her
destiny
,
and
when
she
also
heard
that
Mr.
Arabin
was
expected
to
be
at
Ullathorne
on
the
following
day
,
it
seemed
as
though
all
the
world
were
conspiring
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
Well
,
did
she
not
deserve
it
?
<EOS>
In
that
affair
of
Mr.
Slope
had
not
all
the
world
conspired
against
her
?
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
,
however
,
make
herself
easy
and
at
home
.
<EOS>
When
,
in
the
evening
after
dinner
,
Miss
Thorne
expatiated
on
the
excellence
of
Mr.
Arabin
's
qualities
,
and
hinted
that
any
little
rumour
which
might
be
ill
-
naturedly
spread
abroad
concerning
him
really
meant
nothing
,
Mrs.
Bold
found
herself
unable
to
answer
.
<EOS>
When
Miss
Thorne
went
a
little
further
and
declared
that
she
did
not
know
a
prettier
vicarage
-
house
in
the
county
than
St.
Ewold
's
,
Mrs.
Bold
,
remembering
the
projected
bow
-
window
and
the
projected
priestess
,
still
held
her
tongue
,
though
her
ears
tingled
with
the
conviction
that
all
the
world
knew
that
she
was
in
love
with
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
Well
,
what
would
that
matter
if
they
could
only
meet
and
tell
each
other
what
each
now
longed
to
tell
?
  
<EOS>
And
they
did
meet
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
came
early
in
the
day
and
found
the
two
ladies
together
at
work
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
,
who
,
had
she
known
all
the
truth
,
would
have
vanished
into
air
at
once
,
had
no
conception
that
her
immediate
absence
would
be
a
blessing
,
and
remained
chatting
with
them
till
luncheon
-
time
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
could
talk
about
nothing
but
the
Signora
Neroni
's
beauty
,
would
discuss
no
people
but
the
Stanhopes
.
<EOS>
This
was
very
distressing
to
Eleanor
and
not
very
satisfactory
to
Miss
Thorne
.
<EOS>
But
yet
there
was
evidence
of
innocence
in
his
open
avowal
of
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
they
had
lunch
,
and
then
Mr.
Arabin
went
out
on
parish
duty
,
and
Eleanor
and
Miss
Thorne
were
left
to
take
a
walk
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
the
Signora
Neroni
is
so
lovely
as
people
say
?
"
<EOS>
Eleanor
asked
as
they
were
coming
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
very
beautiful
,
certainly
,
very
beautiful
,
"
Miss
Thorne
answered
;
"
but
I
do
not
know
that
anyone
considers
her
lovely
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
woman
all
men
would
like
to
look
at
,
but
few
,
I
imagine
,
would
be
glad
to
take
her
to
their
hearths
,
<EOS>
even
were
she
unmarried
and
not
afflicted
as
she
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
some
little
comfort
in
this
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
made
the
most
of
it
till
she
got
back
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
was
then
left
alone
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
just
as
it
was
getting
dark
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
came
in
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
beautiful
afternoon
in
the
beginning
of
October
,
and
Eleanor
was
sitting
in
the
window
to
get
the
advantage
of
the
last
daylight
for
her
novel
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
fire
in
the
comfortable
room
,
but
the
weather
was
not
cold
enough
to
make
it
attractive
;
and
as
she
could
see
the
sun
set
from
where
she
sat
,
she
was
not
very
attentive
to
her
book
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
when
he
entered
,
stood
awhile
with
his
back
to
the
fire
in
his
usual
way
,
merely
uttering
a
few
commonplace
remarks
about
the
beauty
of
the
weather
,
while
he
plucked
up
courage
for
more
interesting
converse
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
probably
be
said
that
he
had
resolved
then
and
there
to
make
an
offer
to
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
Men
,
we
believe
,
seldom
make
such
resolves
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
and
Mr.
Stanhope
had
done
so
,
it
is
true
,
but
gentlemen
generally
propose
without
any
absolutely
defined
determination
as
to
their
doing
so
.
<EOS>
Such
was
now
the
case
with
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
lovely
sunset
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
answering
him
on
the
dreadfully
trite
subject
which
he
had
chosen
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
could
not
see
the
sunset
from
the
hearth
-
rug
,
so
he
had
to
go
close
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
lovely
,
"
said
he
,
standing
modestly
so
far
away
from
her
as
to
avoid
touching
the
flounces
of
her
dress
.
<EOS>
Then
it
appeared
that
he
had
nothing
further
to
say
;
so
,
after
gazing
for
a
moment
in
silence
at
the
brightness
of
the
setting
sun
,
he
returned
to
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
found
that
it
was
quite
impossible
for
herself
to
commence
a
conversation
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
she
could
find
nothing
to
say
;
words
,
which
were
generally
plenty
enough
with
her
,
would
not
come
to
her
relief
.
<EOS>
And
moreover
,
do
what
she
would
,
she
could
hardly
prevent
herself
from
crying
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
like
Ullathorne
?
"
said
Mr.
Arabin
,
speaking
from
the
safely
distant
position
which
he
had
assumed
on
the
hearth
-
rug
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
,
very
much
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
Mr.
and
Miss
Thorne
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
like
them
 
<EOS>
but
the
style
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
There
is
something
about
old
-
fashioned
mansions
,
built
as
this
is
,
and
old
-
fashioned
gardens
,
that
to
me
is
especially
delightful
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
everything
old
-
fashioned
,
"
said
Eleanor
;
<EOS>
"
old
-
fashioned
things
are
so
much
the
honestest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
about
that
,
"
said
Mr.
Arabin
,
gently
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
an
opinion
on
which
very
much
may
be
said
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
It
is
strange
how
widely
the
world
is
divided
on
a
subject
which
so
nearly
concerns
us
all
,
and
which
is
so
close
beneath
our
eyes
.
<EOS>
Some
think
that
we
are
quickly
progressing
towards
perfection
,
while
others
imagine
that
virtue
is
disappearing
from
the
earth
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
what
do
you
think
?
"
said
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
She
felt
somewhat
surprised
at
the
tone
which
his
conversation
was
taking
,
and
yet
she
was
relieved
at
his
saying
something
which
enabled
herself
to
speak
without
showing
her
own
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
I
think
,
Mrs.
Bold
?
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
rumbled
his
money
with
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
,
and
looked
and
spoke
very
little
like
a
thriving
lover
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
bane
of
my
life
that
on
important
subjects
I
acquire
no
fixed
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
and
think
,
and
go
on
thinking
,
<EOS>
and
yet
my
thoughts
are
running
ever
in
different
directions
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
whether
or
no
we
do
lean
more
confidently
than
our
fathers
did
on
those
high
hopes
to
which
we
profess
to
aspire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
the
world
grows
more
worldly
every
day
,
"
said
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
because
you
see
more
of
it
than
when
you
were
younger
.
<EOS>
But
we
should
hardly
judge
by
what
we
see
 
<EOS>
we
see
so
very
,
very
little
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
There
was
then
a
pause
for
awhile
,
during
which
Mr.
Arabin
continued
to
turn
over
his
shillings
and
half
-
crowns
.
<EOS>
"
If
we
believe
in
Scripture
,
we
can
hardly
think
that
mankind
in
general
will
now
be
allowed
to
retrograde
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
whose
mind
was
certainly
engaged
otherwise
than
on
the
general
state
of
mankind
,
made
no
answer
to
this
.
<EOS>
She
felt
thoroughly
dissatisfied
with
herself
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
force
her
thoughts
away
from
the
topic
on
which
the
signora
had
spoken
to
her
in
so
strange
a
way
,
and
yet
she
knew
that
she
could
not
converse
with
Mr.
Arabin
in
an
unrestrained
,
natural
tone
till
she
did
so
.
<EOS>
She
was
most
anxious
not
to
show
to
him
any
special
emotion
,
and
yet
she
felt
that
if
he
looked
at
her
,
he
would
at
once
see
that
she
was
not
at
ease
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
doing
so
,
he
left
the
fire
-
place
and
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
took
up
her
book
resolutely
,
but
she
could
not
read
,
for
there
was
a
tear
in
her
eye
,
and
do
what
she
would
,
it
fell
on
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Arabin
's
back
was
turned
to
her
,
she
wiped
it
away
;
but
another
was
soon
coursing
down
her
face
in
its
place
.
<EOS>
They
would
come
 
not
a
deluge
of
tears
that
would
have
betrayed
her
at
once
,
but
one
by
one
,
single
monitors
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
did
not
observe
her
closely
,
and
they
passed
unseen
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
thus
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
,
took
four
or
five
turns
before
he
spoke
another
word
,
and
Eleanor
sat
equally
silent
with
her
face
bent
over
her
book
.
<EOS>
She
was
afraid
that
her
tears
would
get
the
better
of
her
,
and
was
preparing
for
an
escape
from
the
room
,
when
Mr.
Arabin
in
his
walk
stood
opposite
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
come
close
up
but
stood
exactly
on
the
spot
to
which
his
course
brought
him
,
and
then
,
with
his
hands
under
his
coat
-
tails
,
thus
made
his
confession
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Bold
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
owe
you
retribution
for
a
great
offence
of
which
I
have
been
guilty
towards
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Eleanor
's
heart
beat
so
that
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
say
that
he
had
never
been
guilty
of
any
offence
.
<EOS>
So
Mr.
Arabin
thus
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
thought
much
of
it
since
,
and
I
am
now
aware
that
I
was
wholly
unwarranted
in
putting
to
you
a
question
which
I
once
asked
you
.
<EOS>
It
was
indelicate
on
my
part
,
and
perhaps
unmanly
.
<EOS>
No
intimacy
which
may
exist
between
myself
and
your
connexion
,
Dr.
Grantly
,
could
justify
it
.
<EOS>
Nor
could
the
acquaintance
which
existed
between
ourselves
.
<EOS>
"
This
word
acquaintance
struck
cold
on
Eleanor
's
heart
.
<EOS>
Was
this
to
be
her
doom
after
all
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
therefore
think
it
right
to
beg
your
pardon
in
a
humble
spirit
,
and
I
now
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
was
Eleanor
to
say
to
him
?
<EOS>
She
could
not
say
much
because
she
was
crying
,
and
yet
she
must
say
something
.
<EOS>
She
was
most
anxious
to
say
that
something
graciously
,
kindly
,
and
yet
not
in
such
a
manner
as
to
betray
herself
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
felt
herself
so
much
at
a
loss
for
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
I
took
no
offence
,
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
you
did
!
<EOS>
And
had
you
not
done
so
,
you
would
not
have
been
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
were
as
right
to
be
offended
as
I
was
wrong
so
to
offend
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
forgiven
myself
,
but
I
hope
to
hear
that
you
forgive
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
now
past
speaking
calmly
,
though
she
still
continued
to
hide
her
tears
;
and
Mr.
Arabin
,
after
pausing
a
moment
in
vain
for
her
reply
,
was
walking
off
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
she
could
not
allow
him
to
go
unanswered
without
grievously
sinning
against
all
charity
;
so
,
rising
from
her
seat
,
she
gently
touched
his
arm
and
said
,
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
do
not
go
till
I
speak
to
you
!
<EOS>
I
do
forgive
you
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
I
forgive
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
the
hand
that
had
so
gently
touched
his
arm
and
then
gazed
into
her
face
as
if
he
would
peruse
there
,
as
though
written
in
a
book
,
the
whole
future
destiny
of
his
life
;
as
he
did
so
,
there
was
a
sober
,
sad
seriousness
in
his
own
countenance
which
Eleanor
found
herself
unable
to
sustain
.
<EOS>
She
could
only
look
down
upon
the
carpet
,
let
her
tears
trickle
as
they
would
,
and
leave
her
hand
within
his
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
but
for
a
minute
that
they
stood
so
,
but
the
duration
of
that
minute
was
sufficient
to
make
it
ever
memorable
to
them
both
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
was
sure
now
that
she
was
loved
.
<EOS>
No
words
,
be
their
eloquence
what
it
might
,
could
be
more
impressive
than
that
eager
,
melancholy
gaze
.
  
<EOS>
Why
did
he
look
so
into
her
eyes
?
<EOS>
Why
did
he
not
speak
to
her
?
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
he
looked
for
her
to
make
the
first
sign
?
  
<EOS>
And
he
,
though
he
knew
but
little
of
women
,
even
he
knew
that
he
was
loved
.
<EOS>
He
had
only
to
ask
,
and
it
would
be
all
his
own
,
that
inexpressible
loveliness
,
those
ever
-
speaking
but
yet
now
mute
eyes
,
that
feminine
brightness
and
eager
,
loving
spirit
which
had
so
attracted
him
since
first
he
had
encountered
it
at
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
It
might
,
must
,
all
be
his
own
now
.
<EOS>
On
no
other
supposition
was
it
possible
that
she
should
allow
her
hand
to
remain
thus
clasped
within
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
had
only
to
ask
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
but
that
was
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Did
a
minute
suffice
for
all
this
?
<EOS>
Nay
,
perhaps
it
might
be
more
than
a
minute
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
 
<EOS>
"
at
last
he
said
and
then
stopped
himself
.
  
<EOS>
If
he
could
not
speak
,
how
was
she
to
do
so
?
<EOS>
He
had
called
her
by
her
name
,
the
same
name
that
any
merest
stranger
would
have
used
!
<EOS>
She
withdrew
her
hand
from
his
and
moved
as
though
to
return
to
her
seat
.
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
!
"
<EOS>
he
then
said
in
his
softest
tone
,
as
though
the
courage
of
a
lover
were
as
yet
but
half
-
assumed
,
as
though
he
were
still
afraid
of
giving
offence
by
the
freedom
which
he
took
.
<EOS>
She
looked
slowly
,
gently
,
almost
piteously
up
into
his
face
.
<EOS>
There
was
at
any
rate
no
anger
there
to
deter
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
!
"
<EOS>
he
again
exclaimed
,
and
in
a
moment
he
had
her
clasped
to
his
bosom
.
<EOS>
How
this
was
done
,
whether
the
doing
was
with
him
or
her
,
whether
she
had
flown
thither
conquered
by
the
tenderness
of
his
voice
,
or
he
with
a
violence
not
likely
to
give
offence
had
drawn
her
to
his
breast
,
neither
of
them
knew
;
nor
can
I
declare
.
<EOS>
There
was
now
that
sympathy
between
them
which
hardly
admitted
of
individual
motion
.
<EOS>
They
were
one
and
the
same
 
one
flesh
 
<EOS>
one
spirit
 
one
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
,
my
own
Eleanor
,
my
own
,
my
wife
!
"
She
ventured
to
look
up
at
him
through
her
tears
,
and
he
,
bowing
his
face
down
over
hers
,
pressed
his
lips
upon
her
brow
 
his
virgin
lips
,
which
,
since
a
beard
first
grew
upon
his
chin
,
had
never
yet
tasted
the
luxury
of
a
woman
's
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
been
told
that
her
yea
must
be
yea
,
or
her
nay
,
nay
,
but
she
was
called
on
for
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
.
<EOS>
She
told
Miss
Thorne
that
she
was
engaged
to
Mr.
Arabin
,
but
no
such
words
had
passed
between
them
,
<EOS>
no
promises
had
been
asked
or
given
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
let
me
go
,
"
said
she
,
"
let
me
go
now
.
<EOS>
I
am
too
happy
to
remain
 
<EOS>
let
me
go
,
that
I
may
be
alone
.
"
<EOS>
He
did
not
try
to
hinder
her
;
he
did
not
repeat
the
kiss
;
he
did
not
press
another
on
her
lips
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
done
so
,
had
he
been
so
minded
.
<EOS>
She
was
now
all
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
took
his
arm
from
round
her
waist
,
his
arm
that
was
trembling
with
a
new
delight
,
and
let
her
go
.
<EOS>
She
fled
like
a
roe
to
her
own
chamber
,
and
then
,
having
turned
the
bolt
,
she
enjoyed
the
full
luxury
of
her
love
.
<EOS>
She
idolised
,
almost
worshipped
this
man
who
had
so
meekly
begged
her
pardon
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
now
her
own
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
she
wept
and
cried
and
laughed
as
the
hopes
and
fears
and
miseries
of
the
last
few
weeks
passed
in
remembrance
through
her
mind
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
!
<EOS>
That
anyone
should
have
dared
to
think
that
she
who
had
been
chosen
by
him
could
possibly
have
mated
herself
with
Mr.
Slope
!
<EOS>
That
they
should
have
dared
to
tell
him
,
also
,
and
subject
her
bright
happiness
to
such
needless
risk
!
<EOS>
And
then
she
smiled
with
joy
as
she
thought
of
all
the
comforts
that
she
could
give
him
 
not
that
he
cared
for
comforts
,
but
that
it
would
be
so
delicious
for
her
to
give
.
  
<EOS>
She
got
up
and
rang
for
her
maid
that
she
might
tell
her
little
boy
of
his
new
father
,
and
in
her
own
way
she
did
tell
him
.
<EOS>
She
desired
her
maid
to
leave
her
,
in
order
that
she
might
be
alone
with
her
child
;
and
then
,
while
he
lay
sprawling
on
the
bed
,
she
poured
forth
the
praises
,
all
unmeaning
to
him
,
of
the
man
she
had
selected
to
guard
his
infancy
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
be
happy
,
however
,
till
she
had
made
Mr.
Arabin
take
the
child
to
himself
and
thus
,
as
it
were
,
adopt
him
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
The
moment
the
idea
struck
her
<EOS>
she
took
the
baby
up
in
her
arms
and
,
opening
her
door
,
ran
quickly
down
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
at
once
found
,
by
his
step
still
pacing
on
the
floor
,
that
he
was
there
,
and
a
glance
within
the
room
told
her
that
he
was
alone
.
<EOS>
She
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
hurried
in
with
her
precious
charge
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
met
her
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
said
she
,
breathless
with
her
haste
;
"
there
,
take
him
 
take
him
,
and
love
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
took
the
little
fellow
from
her
and
,
kissing
him
again
and
again
,
prayed
God
to
bless
him
.
"
<EOS>
He
shall
be
all
as
my
own
 
all
as
my
own
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
as
she
stooped
to
take
back
her
child
,
kissed
the
hand
that
held
him
and
then
rushed
back
with
her
treasure
to
her
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
thus
that
Mr.
Harding
's
younger
daughter
was
won
for
the
second
time
.
<EOS>
At
dinner
neither
she
nor
Mr.
Arabin
were
very
bright
,
but
their
silence
occasioned
no
remark
.
<EOS>
In
the
drawing
-
room
,
as
we
have
before
said
,
she
told
Miss
Thorne
what
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
The
next
morning
she
returned
to
Barchester
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
went
over
with
his
budget
of
news
to
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
As
Doctor
Grantly
was
not
there
,
he
could
only
satisfy
himself
by
telling
Mrs.
Grantly
how
that
he
intended
himself
the
honour
of
becoming
her
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
In
the
ecstasy
of
her
joy
at
hearing
such
tidings
Mrs.
Grantly
vouchsafed
him
a
warmer
welcome
than
any
he
had
yet
received
from
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
heavens
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
 
it
was
the
general
exclamation
of
the
rectory
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Eleanor
!
<EOS>
Dear
Eleanor
!
<EOS>
What
a
monstrous
injustice
has
been
done
her
!
<EOS>
Well
,
it
shall
all
be
made
up
now
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
she
thought
of
the
signora
.
<EOS>
"
What
lies
people
tell
,
"
she
said
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
But
people
in
this
matter
had
told
no
lies
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
The
Beelzebub
Colt
 
<EOS>
When
Miss
Thorne
left
the
dining
-
room
,
Eleanor
had
formed
no
intention
of
revealing
to
her
what
had
occurred
,
but
when
she
was
seated
beside
her
hostess
on
the
sofa
,
the
secret
dropped
from
her
almost
unawares
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
was
but
a
bad
hypocrite
,
and
she
found
herself
quite
unable
to
continue
talking
about
Mr.
Arabin
as
though
he
were
a
stranger
while
her
heart
was
full
of
him
.
<EOS>
When
Miss
Thorne
,
pursuing
her
own
scheme
with
discreet
zeal
,
asked
the
young
widow
whether
,
in
her
opinion
,
it
would
not
be
a
good
thing
for
Mr.
Arabin
to
get
married
,
she
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
confess
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
would
,
"
said
Eleanor
rather
sheepishly
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
Miss
Thorne
amplified
on
the
idea
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Miss
Thorne
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
"
he
is
going
to
be
married
:
I
am
engaged
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Now
Miss
Thorne
knew
very
well
that
there
had
been
no
such
engagement
when
she
had
been
walking
with
Mrs.
Bold
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
She
had
also
heard
enough
to
be
tolerably
sure
that
there
had
been
no
preliminaries
to
such
an
engagement
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
therefore
,
as
we
have
before
described
,
taken
a
little
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
But
nevertheless
,
she
embraced
her
guest
and
cordially
congratulated
her
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
had
no
opportunity
of
speaking
another
word
to
Mr.
Arabin
that
evening
,
except
such
words
as
all
the
world
might
hear
;
and
these
,
as
may
be
supposed
,
were
few
enough
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
did
her
best
to
leave
them
in
privacy
,
but
Mr.
Thorne
,
who
knew
nothing
of
what
had
occurred
,
and
another
guest
,
a
friend
of
his
,
entirely
interfered
with
her
good
intentions
.
<EOS>
So
poor
Eleanor
had
to
go
to
bed
without
one
sign
of
affection
.
<EOS>
Her
state
,
nevertheless
,
was
not
to
be
pitied
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
she
was
up
early
.
<EOS>
It
was
probable
,
she
thought
,
that
by
going
down
a
little
before
the
usual
hour
of
breakfast
she
might
find
Mr.
Arabin
alone
in
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
Might
it
not
be
that
he
also
would
calculate
that
an
interview
would
thus
be
possible
?
<EOS>
Thus
thinking
,
Eleanor
was
dressed
a
full
hour
before
the
time
fixed
in
the
Ullathorne
household
for
morning
prayers
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
at
once
go
down
.
<EOS>
She
was
afraid
to
seem
to
be
too
anxious
to
meet
her
lover
,
though
heaven
knows
her
anxiety
was
intense
enough
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
sat
herself
down
at
her
window
,
and
repeatedly
looking
at
her
watch
,
nursed
her
child
till
she
thought
she
might
venture
forth
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
found
herself
at
the
dining
-
room
door
,
she
stood
a
moment
,
hesitating
to
turn
the
handle
;
but
when
she
heard
Mr.
Thorne
's
voice
inside
she
hesitated
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Her
object
was
defeated
,
and
she
might
now
go
in
as
soon
as
she
liked
without
the
slightest
imputation
on
her
delicacy
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
and
Mr.
Arabin
were
standing
on
the
hearth
-
rug
,
discussing
the
merits
of
the
Beelzebub
colt
;
or
rather
,
Mr.
Thorne
was
discussing
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
was
listening
.
<EOS>
That
interesting
animal
had
rubbed
the
stump
of
his
tail
against
the
wall
of
his
stable
and
occasioned
much
uneasiness
to
the
Ullathorne
master
of
the
horse
.
<EOS>
Had
Eleanor
but
waited
another
minute
,
Mr.
Thorne
would
have
been
in
the
stables
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Thorne
,
when
he
saw
his
lady
guest
,
repressed
his
anxiety
.
<EOS>
The
Beelzebub
colt
must
do
without
him
.
<EOS>
And
so
the
three
stood
,
saying
little
or
nothing
to
each
other
,
till
at
last
the
master
of
the
house
,
finding
that
he
could
no
longer
bear
his
present
state
of
suspense
respecting
his
favourite
young
steed
,
made
an
elaborate
apology
to
Mrs.
Bold
and
escaped
.
<EOS>
As
he
shut
the
door
behind
him
<EOS>
Eleanor
almost
wished
that
he
had
remained
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
she
was
afraid
of
Mr.
Arabin
,
but
she
hardly
yet
knew
how
to
address
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
soon
relieved
her
from
her
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
He
came
up
to
her
,
and
taking
both
her
hands
in
his
,
he
said
,
"
So
,
Eleanor
,
you
and
I
are
to
be
man
and
wife
.
<EOS>
Is
it
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
up
into
his
face
,
and
her
lips
formed
themselves
into
a
single
syllable
.
<EOS>
She
uttered
no
sound
,
but
he
could
read
the
affirmative
plainly
in
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
great
trust
,
"
said
he
,
"
a
very
great
trust
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
 
it
is
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
not
exactly
taking
what
he
had
said
in
the
sense
that
he
had
meant
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
very
,
very
great
trust
,
and
I
will
do
my
utmost
to
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
also
will
do
my
utmost
to
deserve
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Arabin
very
solemnly
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
winding
his
arm
round
her
waist
,
he
stood
there
gazing
at
the
fire
,
and
she
,
with
her
head
leaning
on
his
shoulder
,
stood
by
him
,
well
satisfied
with
her
position
.
<EOS>
They
neither
of
them
spoke
,
or
found
any
want
of
speaking
.
<EOS>
All
that
was
needful
for
them
to
say
had
been
said
.
<EOS>
The
yea
,
yea
,
had
been
spoken
by
Eleanor
in
her
own
way
 
and
that
way
had
been
perfectly
satisfactory
to
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
it
remained
to
them
each
to
enjoy
the
assurance
of
the
other
's
love
.
<EOS>
And
how
great
that
luxury
is
!
<EOS>
How
far
it
surpasses
any
other
pleasure
which
God
has
allowed
to
his
creatures
!
<EOS>
And
to
a
woman
's
heart
how
doubly
delightful
!
  
<EOS>
When
the
ivy
has
found
its
tower
,
when
the
delicate
creeper
has
found
its
strong
wall
,
we
know
how
the
parasite
plants
grow
and
prosper
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
created
to
stretch
forth
their
branches
alone
,
and
endure
without
protection
the
summer
's
sun
and
the
winter
's
storm
.
<EOS>
Alone
<EOS>
they
but
spread
themselves
on
the
ground
and
cower
unseen
in
the
dingy
shade
.
<EOS>
But
when
they
have
found
their
firm
supporters
,
how
wonderful
is
their
beauty
;
how
all
-
pervading
and
victorious
!
<EOS>
What
is
the
turret
without
its
ivy
,
or
the
high
garden
wall
without
the
jasmine
which
gives
it
its
beauty
and
fragrance
?
<EOS>
The
hedge
without
the
honeysuckle
is
but
a
hedge
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
feeling
still
half
-
existing
,
but
now
half
-
conquered
by
the
force
of
human
nature
,
that
a
woman
should
be
ashamed
of
her
love
till
the
husband
's
right
to
her
compels
her
to
acknowledge
it
.
<EOS>
We
would
fain
preach
a
different
doctrine
.
<EOS>
A
woman
should
glory
in
her
love
,
but
on
that
account
let
her
take
the
more
care
that
it
be
such
as
to
justify
her
glory
.
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
did
glory
in
hers
,
and
she
felt
,
and
had
cause
to
feel
,
that
it
deserved
to
be
held
as
glorious
.
<EOS>
She
could
have
stood
there
for
hours
with
his
arm
round
her
,
had
fate
and
Mr.
Thorne
permitted
it
.
<EOS>
Each
moment
she
crept
nearer
to
his
bosom
and
felt
more
and
more
certain
that
there
was
her
home
.
<EOS>
What
now
to
her
was
the
archdeacon
's
arrogance
,
her
sister
's
coldness
,
or
her
dear
father
's
weakness
?
<EOS>
What
need
she
care
for
the
duplicity
of
such
friends
as
Charlotte
Stanhope
?
<EOS>
She
had
found
the
strong
shield
that
should
guard
her
from
all
wrongs
,
the
trusty
pilot
that
should
henceforward
guide
her
through
the
shoals
and
rocks
.
<EOS>
She
would
give
up
the
heavy
burden
of
her
independence
,
and
once
more
assume
the
position
of
a
woman
and
the
duties
of
a
trusting
and
loving
wife
.
  
<EOS>
And
he
,
too
,
stood
there
fully
satisfied
with
his
place
.
<EOS>
They
were
both
looking
intently
on
the
fire
,
as
though
they
could
read
there
their
future
fate
,
till
at
last
Eleanor
turned
her
face
towards
his
.
<EOS>
"
How
sad
you
are
,
"
she
said
,
smiling
;
and
indeed
his
face
was
,
if
not
sad
,
at
least
serious
.
<EOS>
"
How
sad
you
are
,
love
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sad
,
"
said
he
,
looking
down
at
her
;
"
no
,
certainly
not
sad
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
sweet
,
loving
eyes
were
turned
towards
him
,
and
she
smiled
softly
as
he
answered
her
.
<EOS>
The
temptation
was
too
strong
even
for
the
demure
propriety
of
Mr.
Arabin
,
and
bending
over
her
,
he
pressed
his
lips
to
hers
.
  
<EOS>
Immediately
after
this
Mr.
Thorne
appeared
,
and
they
were
both
delighted
to
hear
that
the
tail
of
the
Beelzebub
colt
was
not
materially
injured
.
  
<EOS>
It
had
been
Mr.
Harding
's
intention
to
hurry
over
to
Ullathorne
as
soon
as
possible
after
his
return
to
Barchester
,
in
order
to
secure
the
support
of
his
daughter
in
his
meditated
revolt
against
the
archdeacon
as
touching
the
deanery
;
but
he
was
spared
the
additional
journey
by
hearing
that
Mrs.
Bold
had
returned
unexpectedly
home
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
had
read
her
note
he
started
off
,
and
found
her
waiting
for
him
in
her
own
house
.
  
<EOS>
How
much
each
of
them
had
to
tell
the
other
,
and
how
certain
each
was
that
the
story
which
he
or
she
had
to
tell
would
astonish
the
other
!
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
I
am
so
anxious
to
see
you
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
,
kissing
his
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Papa
,
I
have
so
much
to
tell
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
daughter
,
returning
the
embrace
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
they
have
offered
me
the
deanery
!
"
said
Mr.
Harding
,
anticipating
by
the
suddenness
of
the
revelation
the
tidings
which
Eleanor
had
to
give
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Papa
,
"
said
she
,
forgetting
her
own
love
and
happiness
in
her
joy
at
the
surprising
news
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Papa
,
can
it
be
possible
?
<EOS>
Dear
Papa
,
how
thoroughly
,
thoroughly
happy
that
makes
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
,
I
think
it
best
to
refuse
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Papa
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
,
Eleanor
,
when
I
explain
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
my
dear
,
how
old
I
am
.
<EOS>
If
I
live
I
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
,
Papa
,
I
must
tell
you
about
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
so
wonder
how
you
'll
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
rejoice
at
it
,
if
it
does
n't
make
you
happy
,
if
you
do
n't
encourage
me
,
I
shall
break
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
that
be
the
case
,
Nelly
,
I
certainly
will
encourage
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
fear
you
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
I
do
so
fear
you
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
And
yet
you
ca
n't
but
think
I
am
the
most
fortunate
woman
living
on
God
's
earth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
,
dearest
?
<EOS>
Then
I
certainly
will
rejoice
with
you
.
<EOS>
Come
,
<EOS>
Nelly
,
come
to
me
and
tell
me
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
led
her
to
the
sofa
and
,
seating
himself
beside
her
,
took
both
her
hands
in
his
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
going
to
be
married
,
Nelly
.
<EOS>
Is
not
that
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
faintly
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
,
if
you
will
approve
;
"
and
then
she
blushed
as
she
remembered
the
promise
which
she
had
so
lately
volunteered
to
him
and
which
she
had
so
utterly
forgotten
in
making
her
engagement
with
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
thought
for
a
moment
who
the
man
could
be
whom
he
was
to
be
called
upon
to
welcome
as
his
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
A
week
since
he
would
have
had
no
doubt
whom
to
name
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
he
would
have
been
prepared
to
give
his
sanction
,
although
he
would
have
done
so
with
a
heavy
heart
.
<EOS>
Now
he
knew
that
at
any
rate
it
would
not
be
Mr.
Slope
,
though
he
was
perfectly
at
a
loss
to
guess
who
could
possibly
have
filled
the
place
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
he
thought
that
the
man
might
be
Bertie
Stanhope
,
and
his
very
soul
sank
within
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Nelly
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Papa
,
promise
to
me
that
,
for
my
sake
,
you
will
love
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Nelly
,
come
;
tell
me
who
it
is
.
"
  
"
But
will
you
love
him
,
Papa
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dearest
,
I
must
love
anyone
that
you
love
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
she
turned
her
face
to
his
and
whispered
into
his
ear
the
name
of
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
No
man
that
she
could
have
named
could
have
more
surprised
or
more
delighted
him
.
<EOS>
Had
he
looked
round
the
world
for
a
son
-
in
-
law
to
his
taste
,
he
could
have
selected
no
one
whom
he
would
have
preferred
to
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
clergyman
;
he
held
a
living
in
the
neighbourhood
;
he
was
of
a
set
to
which
all
Mr.
Harding
's
own
partialities
most
closely
adhered
;
he
was
the
great
friend
of
Dr.
Grantly
;
and
he
was
,
moreover
,
a
man
of
whom
Mr.
Harding
knew
nothing
but
what
he
approved
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
his
surprise
was
so
great
as
to
prevent
the
immediate
expression
of
his
joy
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
thought
of
Mr.
Arabin
in
connexion
with
his
daughter
;
he
had
never
imagined
that
they
had
any
feeling
in
common
.
<EOS>
He
had
feared
that
his
daughter
had
been
made
hostile
to
clergymen
of
Mr.
Arabin
's
stamp
by
her
intolerance
of
the
archdeacon
's
pretensions
.
<EOS>
Had
he
been
put
to
wish
,
he
might
have
wished
for
Mr.
Arabin
for
a
son
-
in
-
law
;
but
had
he
been
put
to
guess
,
the
name
would
never
have
occurred
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Arabin
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
;
"
impossible
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Papa
,
for
heaven
's
sake
do
n't
say
anything
against
him
!
<EOS>
If
you
love
me
,
do
n't
say
anything
against
him
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Papa
,
it
's
done
and
must
n't
be
undone
 
<EOS>
oh
,
Papa
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fickle
Eleanor
!
<EOS>
Where
was
the
promise
that
she
would
make
no
choice
for
herself
without
her
father
's
approval
?
<EOS>
She
had
chosen
,
and
now
demanded
his
acquiescence
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Papa
,
is
n't
he
good
?
<EOS>
Is
n't
he
noble
?
<EOS>
Is
n't
he
religious
,
high
-
minded
,
everything
that
a
good
man
possibly
can
be
?
"
<EOS>
She
clung
to
her
father
,
beseeching
him
for
his
consent
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
Nelly
,
my
child
,
my
own
daughter
!
<EOS>
He
is
;
he
is
noble
and
good
and
high
-
minded
;
he
is
all
that
a
woman
can
love
and
a
man
admire
.
<EOS>
He
shall
be
my
son
,
my
own
son
.
<EOS>
He
shall
be
as
close
to
my
heart
as
you
are
.
<EOS>
My
Nelly
,
my
child
,
my
happy
,
happy
child
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
need
not
pursue
the
interview
any
further
.
<EOS>
By
degrees
they
returned
to
the
subject
of
the
new
promotion
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
tried
to
prove
to
him
,
as
the
Grantlys
had
done
,
that
his
age
could
be
no
bar
to
his
being
a
very
excellent
dean
,
but
those
arguments
had
now
even
less
weight
on
him
than
before
.
<EOS>
He
said
little
or
nothing
but
sat
,
meditative
.
<EOS>
Every
now
<EOS>
and
then
he
would
kiss
his
daughter
and
say
"
yes
,
"
or
"
no
,
"
or
"
very
true
,
"
or
"
well
,
my
dear
,
I
ca
n't
quite
agree
with
you
there
,
"
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
be
got
to
enter
sharply
into
the
question
of
"
to
be
,
or
not
to
be
"
Dean
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
Of
her
and
her
happiness
,
of
Mr.
Arabin
and
his
virtues
,
he
would
talk
as
much
as
Eleanor
desired
 
and
to
tell
the
truth
,
that
was
not
a
little
 
but
about
the
deanery
he
would
now
say
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
He
had
got
a
new
idea
into
his
head
 
why
should
not
Mr.
Arabin
be
the
new
dean
?
   
<EOS>
The
Archdeacon
Is
Satisfied
with
the
State
of
Affairs
 
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
,
in
his
journey
into
Barchester
,
had
been
assured
by
Mr.
Harding
that
all
their
prognostications
about
Mr.
Slope
and
Eleanor
were
groundless
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
,
however
,
had
found
it
very
difficult
to
shake
his
son
-
in
-
law
's
faith
in
his
own
acuteness
.
<EOS>
The
matter
had
,
to
Dr.
Grantly
,
been
so
plainly
corroborated
by
such
patent
evidence
,
borne
out
by
such
endless
circumstances
,
that
he
at
first
refused
to
take
as
true
the
positive
statement
which
Mr.
Harding
made
to
him
of
Eleanor
's
own
disavowal
of
the
impeachment
.
<EOS>
But
at
last
he
yielded
in
a
qualified
way
.
<EOS>
He
brought
himself
to
admit
that
he
would
at
the
present
regard
his
past
convictions
as
a
mistake
,
but
in
doing
this
he
so
guarded
himself
that
if
,
at
any
future
time
,
Eleanor
should
come
forth
to
the
world
as
Mrs.
Slope
,
he
might
still
be
able
to
say
:
"
There
,
I
told
you
so
.
<EOS>
Remember
what
you
said
and
what
I
said
;
and
remember
also
for
coming
years
,
that
I
was
right
in
this
matter
 
as
in
all
others
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
carried
,
however
,
his
concession
so
far
as
to
bring
himself
to
undertake
to
call
at
Eleanor
's
house
,
and
he
did
call
accordingly
,
while
the
father
and
daughter
were
yet
in
the
middle
of
their
conference
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
had
had
so
much
to
hear
and
to
say
that
he
had
forgotten
to
advise
Eleanor
of
the
honour
that
awaited
her
,
and
she
heard
her
brother
-
in
-
law
's
voice
in
the
hall
while
she
was
quite
unprepared
to
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
archdeacon
,
"
she
said
,
springing
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
to
tell
you
that
he
would
come
and
see
you
;
but
to
tell
the
truth
I
had
forgotten
all
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eleanor
fled
away
,
regardless
of
all
her
father
's
entreaties
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
now
,
in
the
first
hours
of
her
joy
,
bring
herself
to
bear
all
the
archdeacon
's
retractions
,
apologies
,
and
congratulations
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
so
much
to
say
,
and
would
be
so
tedious
in
saying
it
;
consequently
,
the
archdeacon
,
when
he
was
shown
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
found
no
one
there
but
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
excuse
Eleanor
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
anything
the
matter
?
"
asked
the
doctor
,
who
at
once
anticipated
that
the
whole
truth
about
Mr.
Slope
had
at
last
come
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
something
is
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
now
whether
you
will
be
much
surprised
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
saw
by
his
father
-
in
-
law
's
manner
that
after
all
he
had
nothing
to
tell
him
about
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
"
said
he
,
"
certainly
not
 
nothing
will
ever
surprise
me
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
many
men
now
-
a
-
days
besides
the
archdeacon
adopt
or
affect
to
adopt
the
_
nil
admirari
_
doctrine
;
but
nevertheless
,
to
judge
from
their
appearance
,
they
are
just
as
subject
to
sudden
emotions
as
their
grandfathers
and
grandmothers
were
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
Mr.
Arabin
has
done
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Arabin
!
<EOS>
It
's
nothing
about
that
daughter
of
Stanhope
's
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
that
woman
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
,
enjoying
his
joke
in
his
sleeve
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
that
woman
!
<EOS>
Is
he
going
to
do
anything
about
any
woman
?
<EOS>
Why
ca
n't
you
speak
out
,
if
you
have
anything
to
say
?
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
I
hate
so
much
as
these
sort
of
mysteries
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
shall
be
no
mystery
with
you
,
Archdeacon
,
though
of
course
it
must
go
no
further
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
.
"
  
"
Except
Susan
.
<EOS>
You
must
promise
me
you
'll
tell
no
one
else
.
"
  
"
Nonsense
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
archdeacon
,
who
was
becoming
angry
in
his
suspense
.
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
have
any
secret
about
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
this
 
that
he
and
Eleanor
are
engaged
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
quite
clear
to
see
,
by
the
archdeacon
's
face
,
that
he
did
not
believe
a
word
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
!
<EOS>
It
's
impossible
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
,
at
any
rate
,
has
just
now
told
me
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
impossible
,
"
repeated
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
ca
n't
say
I
think
it
impossible
.
<EOS>
It
certainly
took
me
by
surprise
,
but
that
does
not
make
it
impossible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
must
be
mistaken
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
assured
him
that
there
was
no
mistake
;
that
he
would
find
,
on
returning
home
,
that
Mr.
Arabin
had
been
at
Plumstead
with
the
express
object
of
making
the
same
declaration
;
that
even
Miss
Thorne
knew
all
about
it
;
and
that
,
in
fact
,
the
thing
was
as
clearly
settled
as
any
such
arrangement
between
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
could
well
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
heavens
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
walking
up
and
down
Eleanor
's
drawing
-
room
.
"
<EOS>
Good
heavens
!
<EOS>
Good
heavens
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
these
exclamations
certainly
betokened
faith
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
properly
gathered
from
it
that
,
at
last
,
Dr.
Grantly
did
believe
the
fact
.
<EOS>
The
first
utterance
clearly
evinced
a
certain
amount
of
distaste
at
the
information
he
had
received
;
the
second
simply
indicated
surprise
;
in
the
tone
of
the
third
Mr.
Harding
fancied
that
he
could
catch
a
certain
gleam
of
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
had
truly
expressed
the
workings
of
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
be
disgusted
to
find
how
utterly
astray
he
had
been
in
all
his
anticipations
.
<EOS>
Had
he
only
been
lucky
enough
to
have
suggested
this
marriage
himself
when
he
first
brought
Mr.
Arabin
into
the
country
,
his
character
for
judgement
and
wisdom
would
have
received
an
addition
which
would
have
classed
him
at
any
rate
next
to
Solomon
.
<EOS>
And
why
had
he
not
done
so
?
<EOS>
Might
he
not
have
foreseen
that
Mr.
Arabin
would
want
a
wife
in
his
parsonage
?
<EOS>
He
had
foreseen
that
Eleanor
would
want
a
husband
,
but
should
he
not
also
have
perceived
that
Mr.
Arabin
was
a
man
much
more
likely
to
attract
her
than
Mr.
Slope
?
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
found
that
he
had
been
at
fault
and
,
of
course
,
could
not
immediately
get
over
his
discomfiture
.
  
<EOS>
Then
his
surprise
was
intense
.
<EOS>
How
sly
this
pair
of
young
turtle
-
doves
had
been
with
him
.
<EOS>
How
egregiously
they
had
hoaxed
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
preached
to
Eleanor
against
her
fancied
attachment
to
Mr.
Slope
at
the
very
time
that
she
was
in
love
with
his
own
protégé
,
Mr.
Arabin
,
and
had
absolutely
taken
that
same
Mr.
Arabin
into
his
confidence
with
reference
to
his
dread
of
Mr.
Slope
's
alliance
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
natural
that
the
archdeacon
should
feel
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
also
great
ground
for
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Looking
at
the
match
by
itself
,
it
was
the
very
thing
to
help
the
doctor
out
of
his
difficulties
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
the
assurance
that
he
should
never
have
Mr.
Slope
for
his
brother
-
in
-
law
was
in
itself
a
great
comfort
.
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Arabin
was
,
of
all
men
,
the
one
with
whom
it
would
best
suit
him
to
be
so
intimately
connected
.
<EOS>
But
the
crowning
comfort
was
the
blow
which
this
marriage
would
give
to
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
He
had
now
certainly
lost
his
wife
;
rumour
was
beginning
to
whisper
that
he
might
possibly
lose
his
position
in
the
palace
;
and
if
Mr.
Harding
would
only
be
true
,
the
great
danger
of
all
would
be
surmounted
.
<EOS>
In
such
case
it
might
be
expected
that
Mr.
Slope
would
own
himself
vanquished
,
and
take
himself
altogether
away
from
Barchester
.
<EOS>
And
so
the
archdeacon
would
again
be
able
to
breathe
pure
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
heavens
!
<EOS>
Good
heavens
!
"
and
the
tone
of
the
fifth
exclamation
made
Mr.
Harding
fully
aware
that
content
was
reigning
in
the
archdeacon
's
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
slowly
,
gradually
,
and
craftily
Mr.
Harding
propounded
his
own
new
scheme
.
<EOS>
Why
should
not
Mr.
Arabin
be
the
new
dean
?
  
<EOS>
Slowly
,
gradually
,
and
thoughtfully
Dr.
Grantly
fell
into
his
father
-
in
-
law
's
views
.
<EOS>
Much
as
he
liked
Mr.
Arabin
,
sincere
as
was
his
admiration
for
that
gentleman
's
ecclesiastical
abilities
,
he
would
not
have
sanctioned
a
measure
which
would
rob
his
father
-
in
-
law
of
his
fairly
earned
promotion
,
were
it
at
all
practicable
to
induce
his
father
-
in
-
law
to
accept
the
promotion
which
he
had
earned
.
<EOS>
But
the
archdeacon
had
,
on
a
former
occasion
,
received
proof
of
the
obstinacy
with
which
Mr.
Harding
could
adhere
to
his
own
views
in
opposition
to
the
advice
of
all
his
friends
.
<EOS>
He
knew
tolerably
well
that
nothing
would
induce
the
meek
,
mild
man
before
him
to
take
the
high
place
offered
to
him
,
if
he
thought
it
wrong
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Knowing
this
,
he
also
said
to
himself
more
than
once
:
"
Why
should
not
Mr.
Arabin
be
Dean
of
Barchester
?
<EOS>
"
It
was
at
last
arranged
between
them
that
they
would
together
start
to
London
by
the
earliest
train
on
the
following
morning
,
making
a
little
detour
to
Oxford
on
their
journey
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Gwynne
's
counsels
,
they
imagined
,
might
perhaps
be
of
assistance
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
These
matters
settled
,
the
archdeacon
hurried
off
,
that
he
might
return
to
Plumstead
and
prepare
for
his
journey
.
<EOS>
The
day
was
extremely
fine
,
and
he
came
into
the
city
in
an
open
gig
.
<EOS>
As
he
was
driving
up
the
High
Street
he
encountered
Mr.
Slope
at
a
crossing
.
<EOS>
Had
he
not
pulled
up
rather
sharply
,
he
would
have
run
over
him
.
<EOS>
The
two
had
never
spoken
to
each
other
since
they
had
met
on
a
memorable
occasion
in
the
bishop
's
study
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
speak
now
,
but
they
looked
each
other
full
in
the
face
,
and
Mr.
Slope
's
countenance
was
as
impudent
,
as
triumphant
,
as
defiant
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Had
Dr.
Grantly
not
known
to
the
contrary
,
he
would
have
imagined
that
his
enemy
had
won
the
deanship
,
the
wife
,
and
all
the
rich
honours
for
which
he
had
been
striving
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
he
had
lost
everything
that
he
had
in
the
world
,
and
had
just
received
his
_
congé
_
from
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
In
leaving
the
town
the
archdeacon
drove
by
the
well
-
remembered
entrance
of
Hiram
's
Hospital
.
<EOS>
There
,
at
the
gate
,
was
a
large
,
untidy
farmer
's
wagon
,
laden
with
untidy
-
looking
furniture
;
and
there
,
inspecting
the
arrival
,
was
good
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
 
not
dressed
in
her
Sunday
best
,
not
very
clean
in
her
apparel
,
not
graceful
as
to
her
bonnet
and
shawl
,
or
,
indeed
,
with
many
feminine
charms
as
to
her
whole
appearance
.
<EOS>
She
was
busy
at
domestic
work
in
her
new
house
,
and
had
just
ventured
out
,
expecting
to
see
no
one
on
the
arrival
of
the
family
chattels
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
was
down
upon
her
before
she
knew
where
she
was
.
  
<EOS>
Her
acquaintance
with
Dr.
Grantly
or
his
family
was
very
slight
indeed
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
knew
every
clergyman
in
the
archdeaconry
 
<EOS>
it
may
almost
be
said
in
the
diocese
 
and
had
some
acquaintance
,
more
or
less
intimate
,
with
their
wives
and
families
.
<EOS>
With
Mr.
Quiverful
he
had
been
concerned
on
various
matters
of
business
,
but
of
Mrs.
Q.
he
had
seen
very
little
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
he
was
in
too
gracious
a
mood
to
pass
her
by
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
The
Quiverfuls
,
one
and
all
,
had
looked
for
the
bitterest
hostility
from
Dr.
Grantly
;
they
knew
his
anxiety
that
Mr.
Harding
should
return
to
his
old
home
at
the
hospital
,
and
they
did
not
know
that
a
new
home
had
been
offered
to
him
at
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
was
therefore
not
a
little
surprised
,
and
not
a
little
rejoiced
also
,
at
the
tone
in
which
she
was
addressed
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
how
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
stretching
his
left
hand
out
of
the
gig
as
he
spoke
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
employed
in
so
pleasant
and
useful
a
manner
;
very
glad
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Quiverful
thanked
him
,
and
shook
hands
with
him
,
and
looked
into
his
face
suspiciously
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
sure
whether
the
congratulations
and
kindness
were
or
were
not
ironical
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
tell
Mr.
Quiverful
from
me
,
"
he
continued
,
"
that
I
am
rejoiced
at
his
appointment
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
comfortable
place
,
Mrs.
Quiverful
,
and
a
comfortable
house
,
and
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
in
it
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
 
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
And
he
drove
on
,
leaving
the
lady
well
pleased
and
astonished
at
his
good
nature
.
<EOS>
On
the
whole
things
were
going
well
with
the
archdeacon
,
and
he
could
afford
to
be
charitable
to
Mrs.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
He
looked
forth
from
his
gig
smilingly
on
all
the
world
,
and
forgave
everyone
in
Barchester
their
sins
,
excepting
only
Mrs.
Proudie
and
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
Had
he
seen
the
bishop
,
he
would
have
felt
inclined
to
pat
even
him
kindly
on
the
head
.
  
<EOS>
He
determined
to
go
home
by
St.
Ewold
's
.
<EOS>
This
would
take
him
some
three
miles
out
of
his
way
,
but
he
felt
that
he
could
not
leave
Plumstead
comfortably
without
saying
one
word
of
good
-
fellowship
to
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
When
he
reached
the
parsonage
,
the
vicar
was
still
out
,
but
from
what
he
had
heard
,
he
did
not
doubt
but
that
he
would
meet
him
on
the
road
between
their
two
houses
.
<EOS>
He
was
right
in
this
,
for
about
half
-
way
home
,
at
a
narrow
turn
,
he
came
upon
Mr.
Arabin
,
who
was
on
horseback
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
well
,
well
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
loudly
,
joyously
,
and
with
supreme
good
humour
;
"
well
,
well
,
well
,
well
;
so
,
after
all
,
we
have
no
further
cause
to
fear
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
from
Mrs.
Grantly
that
they
have
offered
the
deanery
to
Mr.
Harding
,
"
said
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slope
has
lost
more
than
the
deanery
I
find
,
"
and
then
the
archdeacon
laughed
jocosely
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
Arabin
,
you
have
kept
your
secret
well
enough
.
<EOS>
I
know
all
about
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
no
secret
,
Archdeacon
,
"
said
the
other
with
a
quiet
smile
.
<EOS>
"
None
at
all
 
not
for
a
day
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
yesterday
that
I
knew
my
own
good
fortune
,
and
to
-
day
I
went
over
to
Plumstead
to
ask
your
approval
.
<EOS>
From
what
Mrs.
Grantly
has
said
to
me
,
I
am
led
to
hope
that
I
shall
have
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
all
my
heart
,
with
all
my
heart
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
cordially
,
holding
his
friend
fast
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
just
as
I
would
have
it
.
<EOS>
She
is
an
excellent
young
woman
;
she
will
not
come
to
you
empty
-
handed
;
and
I
think
she
will
make
you
a
good
wife
.
<EOS>
If
she
does
her
duty
by
you
as
her
sister
does
by
me
,
you
'll
be
a
happy
man
;
that
's
all
I
can
say
.
<EOS>
"
And
as
he
finished
speaking
a
tear
might
have
been
observed
in
each
of
the
doctor
's
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
warmly
returned
the
archdeacon
's
grasp
,
but
he
said
little
.
<EOS>
His
heart
was
too
full
for
speaking
,
and
he
could
not
express
the
gratitude
which
he
felt
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Grantly
understood
him
as
well
as
though
he
had
spoken
for
an
hour
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
mind
,
Arabin
,
"
said
he
,
"
no
one
but
myself
shall
tie
the
knot
.
<EOS>
We
'll
get
Eleanor
out
to
Plumstead
,
and
it
shall
come
off
there
.
<EOS>
I
'll
make
Susan
stir
herself
,
and
we
'll
do
it
in
style
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
off
to
London
to
-
morrow
on
special
business
.
<EOS>
Harding
goes
with
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
be
back
before
your
bride
has
got
her
wedding
-
dress
ready
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
they
parted
.
  
<EOS>
On
his
journey
home
the
archdeacon
occupied
his
mind
with
preparations
for
the
marriage
festivities
.
<EOS>
He
made
a
great
resolve
that
he
would
atone
to
Eleanor
for
all
the
injury
he
had
done
her
by
the
munificence
of
his
future
treatment
.
<EOS>
He
would
show
her
what
was
the
difference
in
his
eyes
between
a
Slope
and
an
Arabin
.
<EOS>
On
one
other
thing
also
he
decided
with
a
firm
mind
:
if
the
affair
of
the
dean
should
not
be
settled
in
Mr.
Arabin
's
favour
,
nothing
should
prevent
him
putting
a
new
front
and
bow
-
window
to
the
dining
-
room
at
St.
Ewold
's
parsonage
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
we
're
sold
after
all
,
Sue
,
"
said
he
to
his
wife
,
accosting
her
with
a
kiss
as
soon
as
he
entered
his
house
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
call
his
wife
Sue
above
twice
or
thrice
in
a
year
,
and
these
occasions
were
great
high
days
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
has
had
more
sense
than
we
gave
her
credit
for
,
"
said
Mrs.
Grantly
.
  
<EOS>
And
there
was
great
content
in
Plumstead
Rectory
that
evening
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
promised
her
husband
that
she
would
now
open
her
heart
and
take
Mr.
Arabin
into
it
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
she
had
declined
to
do
so
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
Bids
Farewell
to
the
Palace
and
Its
Inhabitants
 
<EOS>
We
must
now
take
leave
of
Mr.
Slope
,
and
of
the
bishop
also
,
and
of
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
These
leave
-
takings
in
novels
are
as
disagreeable
as
they
are
in
real
life
;
not
so
sad
,
indeed
,
for
they
want
the
reality
of
sadness
;
but
quite
as
perplexing
,
and
generally
less
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
What
novelist
,
what
Fielding
,
what
Scott
,
what
George
Sand
,
or
Sue
,
or
Dumas
,
can
impart
an
interest
to
the
last
chapter
of
his
fictitious
history
?
<EOS>
Promises
of
two
children
and
superhuman
happiness
are
of
no
avail
,
nor
assurance
of
extreme
respectability
carried
to
an
age
far
exceeding
that
usually
allotted
to
mortals
.
<EOS>
The
sorrows
of
our
heroes
and
heroines
<EOS>
,
they
are
your
delight
,
oh
public
!
 
<EOS>
their
sorrows
,
or
their
sins
,
or
their
absurdities
;
not
their
virtues
,
good
sense
,
and
consequent
rewards
.
<EOS>
When
we
begin
to
tint
our
final
pages
with
_
couleur
de
rose
_
,
as
in
accordance
with
fixed
rule
we
must
do
,
we
altogether
extinguish
our
own
powers
of
pleasing
.
<EOS>
When
we
become
dull
,
we
offend
your
intellect
;
and
we
must
become
dull
or
we
should
offend
your
taste
.
<EOS>
A
late
writer
,
wishing
to
sustain
his
interest
to
the
last
page
,
hung
his
hero
at
the
end
of
the
third
volume
.
<EOS>
The
consequence
was
that
no
one
would
read
his
novel
.
<EOS>
And
who
can
apportion
out
and
dovetail
his
incidents
,
dialogues
,
characters
,
and
descriptive
morsels
so
as
to
fit
them
all
exactly
into
930
pages
,
without
either
compressing
them
unnaturally
,
or
extending
them
artificially
at
the
end
of
his
labour
?
<EOS>
Do
I
not
myself
know
that
I
am
at
this
moment
in
want
of
a
dozen
pages
,
and
that
I
am
sick
with
cudgelling
my
brains
to
find
them
?
<EOS>
And
then
,
when
everything
is
done
,
the
kindest
-
hearted
critic
of
them
all
invariably
twits
us
with
the
incompetency
and
lameness
of
our
conclusion
.
<EOS>
We
have
either
become
idle
and
neglected
it
,
or
tedious
and
overlaboured
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
insipid
or
unnatural
,
overstrained
or
imbecile
.
<EOS>
It
means
nothing
,
or
attempts
too
much
.
<EOS>
The
last
scene
of
all
,
as
all
last
scenes
we
fear
must
be
,
  
Is
second
childishness
,
and
mere
oblivion
,
Sans
teeth
,
sans
eyes
,
sans
taste
,
sans
everything
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
that
if
some
critic
who
thoroughly
knows
his
work
,
and
has
laboured
on
it
till
experience
has
made
him
perfect
,
will
write
the
last
fifty
pages
of
a
novel
in
the
way
they
should
be
written
,
<EOS>
I
,
for
one
,
will
in
future
do
my
best
to
copy
the
example
.
<EOS>
Guided
by
my
own
lights
only
,
I
confess
that
I
despair
of
success
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
last
week
or
ten
days
Mr.
Slope
had
seen
nothing
of
Mrs.
Proudie
,
and
very
little
of
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
He
still
lived
in
the
palace
,
and
still
went
through
his
usual
routine
work
;
but
the
confidential
doings
of
the
diocese
had
passed
into
other
hands
.
<EOS>
He
had
seen
this
clearly
and
marked
it
well
,
but
it
had
not
much
disturbed
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
indulged
in
other
hopes
till
the
bishop
's
affairs
had
become
dull
to
him
,
and
he
was
moreover
aware
that
,
as
regarded
the
diocese
,
Mrs.
Proudie
had
checkmated
him
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
explained
,
in
the
beginning
of
these
pages
,
how
three
or
four
were
contending
together
as
to
who
,
in
fact
,
should
be
Bishop
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
Each
of
these
had
now
admitted
to
himself
(
or
boasted
to
herself
)
that
Mrs.
Proudie
was
victorious
in
the
struggle
.
<EOS>
They
had
gone
through
a
competitive
examination
of
considerable
severity
,
and
she
had
come
forth
the
winner
,
_
facile
<EOS>
princeps
_
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
for
a
moment
run
her
hard
,
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
It
had
become
,
as
it
were
,
acknowledged
that
Hiram
's
Hospital
should
be
the
testing
-
point
between
them
,
and
now
Mr.
Quiverful
was
already
in
the
hospital
,
the
proof
of
Mrs.
Proudie
's
skill
and
courage
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
did
not
break
down
Mr.
Slope
's
spirit
,
because
he
had
other
hopes
.
<EOS>
But
,
alas
,
at
last
there
came
to
him
a
note
from
his
friend
Sir
Nicholas
,
informing
him
that
the
deanship
was
disposed
of
.
<EOS>
Let
us
give
Mr.
Slope
his
due
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
lie
prostrate
under
this
blow
,
or
give
himself
up
to
vain
lamentations
;
he
did
not
henceforward
despair
of
life
and
call
upon
gods
above
and
gods
below
to
carry
him
off
.
<EOS>
He
sat
himself
down
in
his
chair
,
counted
out
what
monies
he
had
in
hand
for
present
purposes
and
what
others
were
coming
in
to
him
,
bethought
himself
as
to
the
best
sphere
for
his
future
exertions
,
and
at
once
wrote
off
a
letter
to
a
rich
sugar
-
refiner
's
wife
in
Baker
Street
,
who
,
as
he
well
knew
,
was
much
given
to
the
entertainment
and
encouragement
of
serious
young
evangelical
clergymen
.
<EOS>
He
was
again
,
he
said
,
"
upon
the
world
,
having
found
the
air
of
a
cathedral
town
,
and
the
very
nature
of
cathedral
services
,
uncongenial
to
his
spirit
;
"
and
then
he
sat
awhile
,
making
firm
resolves
as
to
his
manner
of
parting
from
the
bishop
,
and
also
as
to
his
future
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
he
rose
,
and
twitched
his
mantle
blue
(
black
)
,
To
-
morrow
to
fresh
woods
and
pastures
new
.
  
<EOS>
Having
received
a
formal
command
to
wait
upon
the
bishop
,
he
rose
and
proceeded
to
obey
it
.
<EOS>
He
rang
the
bell
and
desired
the
servant
to
inform
his
master
that
,
if
it
suited
his
lordship
,
he
,
Mr.
Slope
,
was
ready
to
wait
upon
him
.
<EOS>
The
servant
,
who
well
understood
that
Mr.
Slope
was
no
longer
in
the
ascendant
,
brought
back
a
message
saying
that
"
his
lordship
desired
that
Mr.
Slope
would
attend
him
immediately
in
his
study
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
waited
about
ten
minutes
more
to
prove
his
independence
,
and
then
he
went
into
the
bishop
's
room
.
<EOS>
There
,
as
he
had
expected
,
he
found
Mrs.
Proudie
,
together
with
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hum
,
ha
 
Mr.
Slope
,
pray
take
a
chair
,
"
said
the
gentleman
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
be
seated
,
Mr.
Slope
,
"
said
the
lady
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
ye
,
thank
ye
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
and
walking
round
to
the
fire
,
he
threw
himself
into
one
of
the
armchairs
that
graced
the
hearth
-
rug
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slope
,
"
said
the
bishop
,
"
it
has
become
necessary
that
I
should
speak
to
you
definitively
on
a
matter
that
has
for
some
time
been
pressing
itself
on
my
attention
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
May
I
ask
whether
the
subject
is
in
any
way
connected
with
myself
?
"
said
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
<EOS>
so
 
certainly
 
yes
,
it
certainly
is
connected
with
yourself
,
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
my
lord
,
if
I
may
be
allowed
to
express
a
wish
,
I
would
prefer
that
no
discussion
on
the
subject
should
take
place
between
us
in
the
presence
of
a
third
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
alarm
yourself
,
Mr.
Slope
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
,
"
no
discussion
is
at
all
necessary
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
merely
intends
to
express
his
own
wishes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
merely
intend
,
Mr.
Slope
,
to
express
my
own
wishes
 
<EOS>
no
discussion
will
be
at
all
necessary
,
"
said
the
bishop
,
reiterating
his
wife
's
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
more
,
my
lord
,
than
we
any
of
us
can
be
sure
of
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
;
"
I
can
not
,
however
,
force
Mrs.
Proudie
to
leave
the
room
;
nor
can
I
refuse
to
remain
here
if
it
be
your
lordship
's
wish
that
I
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
his
lordship
's
wish
,
certainly
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slope
,
"
began
the
bishop
in
a
solemn
,
serious
voice
,
"
it
grieves
me
to
have
to
find
fault
.
<EOS>
It
grieves
me
much
to
have
to
find
fault
with
a
clergyman
 
but
especially
so
with
a
clergyman
in
your
position
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
have
I
done
amiss
,
my
lord
?
"
demanded
Mr.
Slope
boldly
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
done
amiss
,
Mr.
Slope
?
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
,
standing
erect
before
the
culprit
and
raising
that
terrible
forefinger
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
dare
to
ask
the
bishop
what
you
have
done
amiss
?
<EOS>
Does
not
your
conscience
 
"
  
"
Mrs.
Proudie
,
pray
let
it
be
understood
,
once
for
all
,
that
I
will
have
no
words
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
sir
,
but
you
will
have
words
,
"
said
she
;
"
you
must
have
words
.
<EOS>
Why
have
you
had
so
many
words
with
that
Signora
Neroni
?
<EOS>
Why
have
you
disgraced
yourself
,
you
a
clergyman
,
too
,
by
constantly
consorting
with
such
a
woman
as
that
 
with
a
married
woman
 
with
one
altogether
unfit
for
a
clergyman
's
society
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
I
was
introduced
to
her
in
your
drawing
-
room
,
"
retorted
Mr.
Slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
shamefully
you
behaved
there
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
;
"
most
shamefully
.
<EOS>
I
was
wrong
to
allow
you
to
remain
in
the
house
a
day
after
what
I
then
saw
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
insisted
on
your
instant
dismissal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
yet
to
learn
,
Mrs.
Proudie
,
that
you
have
the
power
to
insist
either
on
my
going
from
hence
or
on
my
staying
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
to
have
the
privilege
of
saying
who
shall
and
who
shall
not
frequent
my
own
drawing
-
room
!
<EOS>
I
am
not
to
save
my
servants
and
dependants
from
having
their
morals
corrupted
by
improper
conduct
!
<EOS>
I
am
not
to
save
my
own
daughters
from
impurity
!
<EOS>
I
will
let
you
see
,
Mr.
Slope
,
whether
I
have
the
power
or
whether
I
have
not
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
the
goodness
to
understand
that
you
no
longer
fill
any
situation
about
the
bishop
,
and
as
your
room
will
be
immediately
wanted
in
the
palace
for
another
chaplain
,
I
must
ask
you
to
provide
yourself
with
apartments
as
soon
as
may
be
convenient
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
appealing
to
the
bishop
,
and
so
turning
his
back
completely
on
the
lady
,
"
will
you
permit
me
to
ask
that
I
may
have
from
your
own
lips
any
decision
that
you
may
have
come
to
on
this
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
Mr.
Slope
,
certainly
,
"
said
the
bishop
;
"
that
is
but
reasonable
.
<EOS>
Well
,
my
decision
is
that
you
had
better
look
for
some
other
preferment
.
<EOS>
For
the
situation
which
you
have
lately
held
I
do
not
think
that
you
are
well
suited
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
,
my
lord
,
has
been
my
fault
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
That
Signora
Neroni
is
one
fault
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
;
"
and
a
very
abominable
fault
she
is
;
very
abominable
and
very
disgraceful
.
<EOS>
Fie
,
Mr.
Slope
,
fie
!
<EOS>
You
an
evangelical
clergyman
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
I
desire
to
know
for
what
fault
I
am
turned
out
of
your
lordship
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
hear
what
Mrs.
Proudie
says
,
"
said
the
bishop
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
publish
the
history
of
this
transaction
,
my
lord
,
as
I
decidedly
shall
do
in
my
own
vindication
,
I
presume
you
will
not
wish
me
to
state
that
you
have
discarded
me
at
your
wife
's
bidding
 
because
she
has
objected
to
my
being
acquainted
with
another
lady
,
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
prebendaries
of
the
chapter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
publish
what
you
please
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
not
be
insane
enough
to
publish
any
of
your
doings
in
Barchester
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
have
not
heard
of
your
kneelings
at
that
creature
's
feet
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
if
she
has
any
feet
 
and
of
your
constant
slobbering
over
her
hand
?
<EOS>
I
advise
you
to
beware
,
Mr.
Slope
,
of
what
you
do
and
say
.
<EOS>
Clergymen
have
been
unfrocked
for
less
than
what
you
have
been
guilty
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
if
this
goes
on
I
shall
be
obliged
to
indict
this
woman
 
Mrs.
Proudie
<EOS>
I
mean
 
for
defamation
of
character
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Mr.
Slope
,
you
had
better
now
retire
,
"
said
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
enclose
to
you
a
cheque
for
any
balance
that
may
be
due
to
you
;
under
the
present
circumstances
,
it
will
of
course
be
better
for
all
parties
that
you
should
leave
the
palace
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
.
<EOS>
I
will
allow
you
for
your
journey
back
to
London
and
for
your
maintenance
in
Barchester
for
a
week
from
this
date
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
,
however
,
you
wish
to
remain
in
this
neighbourhood
;
"
said
Mrs.
Proudie
,
"
and
will
solemnly
pledge
yourself
never
again
to
see
that
woman
,
and
will
promise
also
to
be
more
circumspect
in
your
conduct
,
the
bishop
will
mention
your
name
to
Mr.
Quiverful
,
who
now
wants
a
curate
at
Puddingdale
.
<EOS>
The
house
is
,
I
imagine
,
quite
sufficient
for
your
requirements
,
and
there
will
moreover
be
a
stipend
of
fifty
pounds
a
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
May
God
forgive
you
,
madam
,
for
the
manner
in
which
you
have
treated
me
,
"
said
Mr.
Slope
,
looking
at
her
with
a
very
heavenly
look
;
"
and
remember
this
,
madam
,
that
you
yourself
may
still
have
a
fall
;
"
and
he
looked
at
her
with
a
very
worldly
look
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
the
bishop
,
I
pity
him
!
"
<EOS>
And
so
saying
,
Mr.
Slope
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
Thus
ended
the
intimacy
of
the
Bishop
of
Barchester
with
his
first
confidential
chaplain
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
was
right
in
this
;
namely
,
that
Mr.
Slope
was
not
insane
enough
to
publish
to
the
world
any
of
his
doings
in
Barchester
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
trouble
his
friend
Mr.
Towers
with
any
written
statement
of
the
iniquity
of
Mrs.
Proudie
,
or
the
imbecility
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
He
was
aware
that
it
would
be
wise
in
him
to
drop
for
the
future
all
allusion
to
his
doings
in
the
cathedral
city
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
the
interview
just
recorded
he
left
Barchester
,
shaking
the
dust
off
his
feet
as
he
entered
the
railway
carriage
;
and
he
gave
no
longing
,
lingering
look
after
the
cathedral
towers
as
the
train
hurried
him
quickly
out
of
their
sight
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
well
known
that
the
family
of
the
Slopes
never
starve
:
they
always
fall
on
their
feet
,
like
cats
;
and
let
them
fall
where
they
will
,
they
live
on
the
fat
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
Our
Mr.
Slope
did
so
.
<EOS>
On
his
return
to
town
he
found
that
the
sugar
-
refiner
had
died
and
that
his
widow
was
inconsolable
 
in
other
words
,
in
want
of
consolation
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
consoled
her
,
and
soon
found
himself
settled
with
much
comfort
in
the
house
in
Baker
Street
.
<EOS>
He
possessed
himself
,
also
,
before
long
,
of
a
church
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Red
Road
,
and
became
known
to
fame
as
one
of
the
most
eloquent
preachers
and
pious
clergymen
in
that
part
of
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
There
let
us
leave
him
.
  
<EOS>
Of
the
bishop
and
his
wife
very
little
further
need
be
said
.
<EOS>
From
that
time
forth
nothing
material
occurred
to
interrupt
the
even
course
of
their
domestic
harmony
.
<EOS>
Very
speedily
,
a
further
vacancy
on
the
bench
of
bishops
gave
to
Dr.
Proudie
the
seat
in
the
House
of
Lords
,
which
he
at
first
so
anxiously
longed
for
.
<EOS>
But
by
this
time
he
had
become
a
wiser
man
.
<EOS>
He
did
certainly
take
his
seat
,
and
occasionally
registered
a
vote
in
favour
of
Government
views
on
ecclesiastical
matters
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
thoroughly
learnt
that
his
proper
sphere
of
action
lay
in
close
contiguity
with
Mrs.
Proudie
's
wardrobe
.
<EOS>
He
never
again
aspired
to
disobey
,
or
seemed
even
to
wish
for
autocratic
diocesan
authority
.
<EOS>
If
ever
he
thought
of
freedom
,
he
did
so
as
men
think
of
the
millennium
,
as
of
a
good
time
which
may
be
coming
,
but
which
nobody
expects
to
come
in
their
day
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Proudie
might
be
said
still
to
bloom
,
and
was
,
at
any
rate
,
strong
,
and
the
bishop
had
no
reason
to
apprehend
that
he
would
be
speedily
visited
with
the
sorrows
of
a
widower
's
life
.
  
<EOS>
He
is
still
Bishop
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
He
has
so
graced
that
throne
that
the
Government
has
been
averse
to
translate
him
,
even
to
higher
dignities
.
<EOS>
There
may
he
remain
,
under
safe
pupilage
,
till
the
newfangled
manners
of
the
age
have
discovered
him
to
be
superannuated
and
bestowed
on
him
a
pension
.
<EOS>
As
for
Mrs.
Proudie
,
our
prayers
for
her
are
that
she
may
live
forever
.
   
<EOS>
The
New
Dean
Takes
Possession
of
the
Deanery
,
and
the
New
Warden
of
the
Hospital
 
Mr.
Harding
and
the
archdeacon
together
made
their
way
to
Oxford
,
and
there
,
by
dint
of
cunning
argument
,
they
induced
the
Master
of
Lazarus
also
to
ask
himself
this
momentous
question
:
"
Why
should
not
Mr.
Arabin
be
Dean
of
Barchester
?
<EOS>
"
He
,
of
course
,
for
awhile
tried
his
hand
at
persuading
Mr.
Harding
that
he
was
foolish
,
overscrupulous
,
self
-
willed
,
and
weak
-
minded
;
but
he
tried
in
vain
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Harding
would
not
give
way
to
Dr.
Grantly
,
it
was
not
likely
that
he
would
give
way
to
Dr.
Gwynne
,
more
especially
now
that
so
admirable
a
scheme
as
that
of
inducting
Mr.
Arabin
into
the
deanery
had
been
set
on
foot
.
<EOS>
When
the
master
found
that
his
eloquence
was
vain
,
and
heard
also
that
Mr.
Arabin
was
about
to
become
Mr.
Harding
's
son
-
in
-
law
,
he
confessed
that
he
also
would
,
under
such
circumstances
,
be
glad
to
see
his
old
friend
and
protégé
,
the
fellow
of
his
college
,
placed
in
the
comfortable
position
that
was
going
a
-
begging
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
might
be
the
means
you
know
,
Master
,
of
keeping
Mr.
Slope
out
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
with
grave
caution
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
no
more
chance
of
it
,
"
said
the
master
,
"
than
our
college
chaplain
.
<EOS>
I
know
more
about
it
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
had
been
right
in
her
surmise
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
Master
of
Lazarus
who
had
been
instrumental
in
representing
in
high
places
the
claims
which
Mr.
Harding
had
upon
the
Government
,
and
he
now
consented
to
use
his
best
endeavours
towards
getting
the
offer
transferred
to
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
The
three
of
them
went
on
to
London
together
,
and
there
they
remained
a
week
,
to
the
great
disgust
of
Mrs.
Grantly
,
and
most
probably
also
of
Mrs.
Gwynne
.
<EOS>
The
minister
was
out
of
town
in
one
direction
,
and
his
private
secretary
in
another
.
<EOS>
The
clerks
who
remained
could
do
nothing
in
such
a
matter
as
this
,
and
all
was
difficulty
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
The
two
doctors
seemed
to
have
plenty
to
do
;
they
bustled
here
<EOS>
and
they
bustled
there
,
and
complained
at
their
club
in
the
evenings
that
they
had
been
driven
off
their
legs
;
but
Mr.
Harding
had
no
occupation
.
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
he
suggested
that
he
might
perhaps
return
to
Barchester
.
<EOS>
His
request
,
however
,
was
peremptorily
refused
,
and
he
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
while
away
his
time
in
Westminster
Abbey
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
an
answer
from
the
great
man
came
.
<EOS>
The
Master
of
Lazarus
had
made
his
proposition
through
the
Bishop
of
Belgravia
.
<EOS>
Now
this
bishop
,
though
but
newly
gifted
with
his
diocesan
honours
,
was
a
man
of
much
weight
in
the
clerico
-
political
world
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
if
not
as
pious
,
at
any
rate
as
wise
as
St.
Paul
,
and
had
been
with
so
much
effect
all
things
to
all
men
that
,
though
he
was
great
among
the
dons
of
Oxford
,
he
had
been
selected
for
the
most
favourite
seat
on
the
bench
by
a
Whig
prime
minister
.
<EOS>
To
him
Dr.
Gwynne
had
made
known
his
wishes
and
his
arguments
,
and
the
bishop
had
made
them
known
to
the
Marquis
of
Kensington
-
Gore
.
<EOS>
The
marquis
,
who
was
Lord
High
Steward
of
the
Pantry
Board
,
and
who
by
most
men
was
supposed
to
hold
the
highest
office
out
of
the
cabinet
,
trafficked
much
in
affairs
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
He
not
only
suggested
the
arrangement
to
the
minister
over
a
cup
of
coffee
,
standing
on
a
drawing
-
room
rug
in
Windsor
Castle
,
but
he
also
favourably
mentioned
Mr.
Arabin
's
name
in
the
ear
of
a
distinguished
person
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
the
matter
was
arranged
.
<EOS>
The
answer
of
the
great
man
came
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
was
made
Dean
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
The
three
clergymen
who
had
come
up
to
town
on
this
important
mission
dined
together
with
great
glee
on
the
day
on
which
the
news
reached
them
.
<EOS>
In
a
silent
,
decent
,
clerical
manner
they
toasted
Mr.
Arabin
with
full
bumpers
of
claret
.
<EOS>
The
satisfaction
of
all
of
them
was
supreme
.
<EOS>
The
Master
of
Lazarus
had
been
successful
in
his
attempt
,
and
success
is
dear
to
us
all
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
had
trampled
upon
Mr.
Slope
,
and
had
lifted
to
high
honours
the
young
clergyman
whom
he
had
induced
to
quit
the
retirement
and
comfort
of
the
university
.
<EOS>
So
at
least
the
archdeacon
thought
;
though
,
to
speak
sooth
,
not
he
,
but
circumstances
,
had
trampled
on
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
But
the
satisfaction
of
Mr.
Harding
was
,
of
all
,
perhaps
,
the
most
complete
.
<EOS>
He
laid
aside
his
usual
melancholy
manner
and
brought
forth
little
quiet
jokes
from
the
inmost
mirth
of
his
heart
;
he
poked
his
fun
at
the
archdeacon
about
Mr.
Slope
's
marriage
and
quizzed
him
for
his
improper
love
for
Mrs.
Proudie
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
they
all
returned
to
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
arranged
that
Mr.
Arabin
should
know
nothing
of
what
had
been
done
till
he
received
the
minister
's
letter
from
the
hands
of
his
embryo
father
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
In
order
that
no
time
might
be
lost
,
a
message
had
been
sent
to
him
by
the
preceding
night
's
post
,
begging
him
to
be
at
the
deanery
at
the
hour
that
the
train
from
London
arrived
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
in
this
which
surprised
Mr.
Arabin
.
<EOS>
It
had
somehow
got
about
through
all
Barchester
that
Mr.
Harding
was
the
new
dean
,
and
all
Barchester
was
prepared
to
welcome
him
with
pealing
bells
and
full
hearts
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
had
certainly
had
a
party
;
there
had
certainly
been
those
in
Barchester
who
were
prepared
to
congratulate
him
on
his
promotion
with
assumed
sincerity
,
but
even
his
own
party
was
not
broken
-
hearted
by
his
failure
.
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
of
the
city
,
even
the
high
-
souled
,
ecstatic
young
ladies
of
thirty
-
five
,
had
begun
to
comprehend
that
their
welfare
,
and
the
welfare
of
the
place
,
was
connected
in
some
mysterious
manner
with
daily
chants
and
bi
-
weekly
anthems
.
<EOS>
The
expenditure
of
the
palace
had
not
added
much
to
the
popularity
of
the
bishop
's
side
of
the
question
;
and
,
on
the
whole
,
there
was
a
strong
reaction
.
<EOS>
When
it
became
known
to
all
the
world
that
Mr.
Harding
was
to
be
the
new
dean
,
all
the
world
rejoiced
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
,
we
have
said
,
was
not
surprised
at
the
summons
which
called
him
to
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
as
yet
seen
Mr.
Harding
since
Eleanor
had
accepted
him
,
nor
had
he
seen
him
since
he
had
learnt
his
future
father
-
in
-
law
's
preferment
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
more
natural
,
more
necessary
,
than
that
they
should
meet
each
other
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
was
waiting
in
the
deanery
parlour
when
Mr.
Harding
and
Dr.
Grantly
were
driven
up
from
the
station
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
some
excitement
in
the
bosoms
of
them
all
,
as
they
met
and
shook
hands
;
by
far
too
much
to
enable
either
of
them
to
begin
his
story
and
tell
it
in
a
proper
equable
style
of
narrative
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
was
some
minutes
quite
dumbfounded
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
could
only
talk
in
short
,
spasmodic
sentences
about
his
love
and
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
He
slipped
in
,
as
best
he
could
,
some
sort
of
congratulation
about
the
deanship
,
and
then
went
on
with
his
hopes
and
fears
 
hopes
that
he
might
be
received
as
a
son
,
and
fears
that
he
hardly
deserved
such
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
Then
he
went
back
to
the
dean
;
it
was
the
most
thoroughly
satisfactory
appointment
,
he
said
,
of
which
he
had
ever
heard
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
!
<EOS>
But
!
<EOS>
But
 
"
said
Mr.
Harding
,
and
then
,
failing
to
get
any
further
,
he
looked
imploringly
at
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
Arabin
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
"
that
,
after
all
you
are
not
destined
to
be
son
-
in
-
law
to
a
dean
.
<EOS>
Nor
am
I
either
:
more
's
the
pity
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
looked
at
him
for
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
Is
not
Mr.
Harding
to
be
the
new
dean
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
appears
not
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
's
face
fell
a
little
,
and
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
It
was
plainly
to
be
seen
from
them
both
that
there
was
no
cause
of
unhappiness
in
the
matter
,
at
least
not
of
unhappiness
to
them
;
but
there
was
as
yet
no
elucidation
of
the
mystery
.
  
<EOS>
"
Think
how
old
I
am
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
imploringly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fiddlestick
!
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
very
well
,
but
it
wo
n't
make
a
young
man
of
me
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
is
to
be
dean
?
"
asked
Mr.
Arabin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
that
's
the
question
,
"
said
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Mr.
Precentor
,
since
you
obstinately
refuse
to
be
anything
else
,
let
us
know
who
is
to
be
the
man
.
<EOS>
He
has
got
the
nomination
in
his
pocket
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
eyes
brim
full
of
tears
,
Mr.
Harding
pulled
out
the
letter
and
handed
it
to
his
future
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
make
a
little
speech
but
failed
altogether
.
<EOS>
Having
given
up
the
document
,
he
turned
round
to
the
wall
,
feigning
to
blow
his
nose
,
and
then
sat
himself
down
on
the
old
dean
's
dingy
horsehair
sofa
.
<EOS>
And
here
we
find
it
necessary
to
bring
our
account
of
the
interview
to
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
can
we
pretend
to
describe
the
rapture
with
which
Mr.
Harding
was
received
by
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
She
wept
with
grief
and
wept
with
joy
 
with
grief
that
her
father
should
,
in
his
old
age
,
still
be
without
that
rank
and
worldly
position
which
,
according
to
her
ideas
,
he
had
so
well
earned
;
and
with
joy
in
that
he
,
her
darling
father
,
should
have
bestowed
on
that
other
dear
one
the
good
things
of
which
he
himself
would
not
open
his
hand
to
take
possession
.
<EOS>
And
here
Mr.
Harding
again
showed
his
weakness
.
<EOS>
In
the
_
mêlée
_
of
this
exposal
of
their
loves
and
reciprocal
affection
,
he
found
himself
unable
to
resist
the
entreaties
of
all
parties
that
the
lodgings
in
the
High
Street
should
be
given
up
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
would
not
live
in
the
deanery
,
she
said
,
unless
her
father
lived
there
also
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
would
not
be
dean
,
unless
Mr.
Harding
would
be
co
-
dean
with
him
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
declared
that
his
father
-
in
-
law
should
not
have
his
own
way
in
everything
,
and
Mrs.
Grantly
carried
him
off
to
Plumstead
,
that
he
might
remain
there
till
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Arabin
were
in
a
state
to
receive
him
in
their
own
mansion
.
  
<EOS>
Pressed
by
such
arguments
as
these
,
what
could
a
weak
old
man
do
but
yield
?
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
yet
another
task
which
it
behoved
Mr.
Harding
to
do
before
he
could
allow
himself
to
be
at
rest
.
<EOS>
Little
has
been
said
in
these
pages
of
the
state
of
those
remaining
old
men
who
had
lived
under
his
sway
at
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
But
not
on
this
account
must
it
be
presumed
that
he
had
forgotten
them
,
or
that
in
their
state
of
anarchy
and
in
their
want
of
due
government
he
had
omitted
to
visit
them
.
<EOS>
He
visited
them
constantly
,
and
had
latterly
given
them
to
understand
that
they
would
soon
be
required
to
subscribe
their
adherence
to
a
new
master
.
<EOS>
There
were
now
but
five
of
them
,
one
of
them
having
been
but
quite
lately
carried
to
his
rest
 
but
five
of
the
full
number
,
which
had
hitherto
been
twelve
,
and
which
was
now
to
be
raised
to
twenty
-
four
,
including
women
.
<EOS>
Of
these
,
old
Bunce
,
who
for
many
years
had
been
the
favourite
of
the
late
warden
,
was
one
;
and
Abel
Handy
,
who
had
been
the
humble
means
of
driving
that
warden
from
his
home
,
was
another
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
now
resolved
that
he
himself
would
introduce
the
new
warden
to
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
many
circumstances
might
conspire
to
make
the
men
receive
Mr.
Quiverful
with
aversion
and
disrespect
;
he
felt
also
that
Mr.
Quiverful
might
himself
feel
some
qualms
of
conscience
if
he
entered
the
hospital
with
an
idea
that
he
did
so
in
hostility
to
his
predecessor
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
therefore
determined
to
walk
in
,
arm
in
arm
with
Mr.
Quiverful
,
and
to
ask
from
these
men
their
respectful
obedience
to
their
new
master
.
  
<EOS>
On
returning
to
Barchester
,
he
found
that
Mr.
Quiverful
had
not
yet
slept
in
the
hospital
house
,
or
entered
on
his
new
duties
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
made
known
to
that
gentleman
his
wishes
,
and
his
proposition
was
not
rejected
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
bright
,
clear
morning
,
though
in
November
,
that
Mr.
Harding
and
Mr.
Quiverful
,
arm
in
arm
,
walked
through
the
hospital
gate
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
trait
in
our
old
friend
's
character
that
he
did
nothing
with
parade
.
<EOS>
He
omitted
,
even
in
the
more
important
doings
of
his
life
,
that
sort
of
parade
by
which
most
of
us
deem
it
necessary
to
grace
our
important
doings
.
<EOS>
We
have
house
-
warmings
,
christenings
,
and
gala
days
;
we
keep
,
if
not
our
own
birthdays
,
those
of
our
children
;
we
are
apt
to
fuss
ourselves
if
called
upon
to
change
our
residences
and
have
,
almost
all
of
us
,
our
little
state
occasions
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
had
no
state
occasions
.
<EOS>
When
he
left
his
old
house
,
he
went
forth
from
it
with
the
same
quiet
composure
as
though
he
were
merely
taking
his
daily
walk
;
now
that
he
re
-
entered
it
with
another
warden
under
his
wing
,
he
did
so
with
the
same
quiet
step
and
calm
demeanour
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
little
less
upright
than
he
had
been
five
years
<EOS>
,
nay
,
it
was
now
nearly
six
years
ago
;
he
walked
perhaps
a
little
slower
;
his
footfall
was
perhaps
a
thought
less
firm
;
otherwise
one
might
have
said
that
he
was
merely
returning
with
a
friend
under
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
This
friendliness
was
everything
to
Mr.
Quiverful
.
<EOS>
To
him
,
even
in
his
poverty
,
the
thought
that
he
was
supplanting
a
brother
clergyman
so
kind
and
courteous
as
Mr.
Harding
had
been
very
bitter
.
<EOS>
Under
his
circumstances
it
had
been
impossible
for
him
to
refuse
the
proffered
boon
;
he
could
not
reject
the
bread
that
was
offered
to
his
children
,
or
refuse
to
ease
the
heavy
burden
that
had
so
long
oppressed
that
poor
wife
of
his
;
nevertheless
,
it
had
been
very
grievous
to
him
to
think
that
in
going
to
the
hospital
he
might
encounter
the
ill
-
will
of
his
brethren
in
the
diocese
.
<EOS>
All
this
Mr.
Harding
had
fully
comprehended
.
<EOS>
It
was
for
such
feelings
as
these
,
for
the
nice
comprehension
of
such
motives
,
that
his
heart
and
intellect
were
peculiarly
fitted
.
<EOS>
In
most
matters
of
worldly
import
the
archdeacon
set
down
his
father
-
in
-
law
as
little
better
than
a
fool
.
<EOS>
And
perhaps
he
was
right
.
<EOS>
But
in
some
other
matters
,
equally
important
if
they
be
rightly
judged
,
Mr.
Harding
,
had
he
been
so
minded
,
might
with
as
much
propriety
have
set
down
his
son
-
in
-
law
for
a
fool
.
<EOS>
Few
men
,
however
,
are
constituted
as
was
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
He
had
that
nice
appreciation
of
the
feelings
of
others
which
belongs
of
right
exclusively
to
women
.
  
<EOS>
Arm
in
arm
they
walked
into
the
inner
quadrangle
of
the
building
,
and
there
the
five
old
men
met
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
shook
hands
with
them
all
,
and
then
Mr.
Quiverful
did
the
same
.
<EOS>
With
Bunce
Mr.
Harding
shook
hands
twice
,
and
Mr.
Quiverful
was
about
to
repeat
the
same
ceremony
,
but
the
old
man
gave
him
no
encouragement
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
to
know
that
at
last
you
have
a
new
warden
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
in
a
very
cheery
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
very
old
for
any
change
,
"
said
one
of
them
,
"
but
we
do
suppose
it
be
all
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
 
certainly
it
is
for
the
best
,
"
said
Mr.
Harding
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
again
have
a
clergyman
of
your
own
church
under
the
same
roof
with
you
,
and
a
very
excellent
clergyman
you
will
have
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
to
know
that
so
good
a
man
is
coming
to
take
care
of
you
,
and
that
it
is
no
stranger
,
but
a
friend
of
my
own
who
will
allow
me
from
time
to
time
to
come
in
and
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
very
thankful
to
your
Reverence
,
"
said
another
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
tell
you
,
my
good
friends
,
"
said
Mr.
Quiverful
,
"
how
extremely
grateful
I
am
to
Mr.
Harding
for
his
kindness
to
me
 
<EOS>
I
must
say
his
uncalled
-
for
,
unexpected
kindness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
always
very
kind
,
"
said
a
third
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
can
do
to
fill
the
void
which
he
left
here
<EOS>
I
will
do
.
<EOS>
For
your
sake
and
my
own
I
will
do
so
,
and
especially
for
his
sake
.
<EOS>
But
to
you
who
have
known
him
,
I
can
never
be
the
same
well
-
loved
friend
and
father
that
he
has
been
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
no
,
"
said
old
Bunce
,
who
hitherto
had
held
his
peace
;
"
no
one
can
be
that
.
<EOS>
Not
if
the
new
bishop
sent
a
hangel
to
us
out
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
We
does
n't
doubt
you
'll
do
your
best
,
sir
,
but
you
'll
not
be
like
the
old
master
 
not
to
us
old
ones
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Fie
,
Bunce
,
fie
;
how
dare
you
talk
in
that
way
?
"
said
Mr.
Harding
;
but
as
he
scolded
the
old
man
he
still
held
him
by
his
arm
and
pressed
it
with
warm
affection
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
getting
up
any
enthusiasm
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
How
could
five
old
men
tottering
away
to
their
final
resting
place
be
enthusiastic
on
the
reception
of
a
stranger
?
<EOS>
What
could
Mr.
Quiverful
be
to
them
,
or
they
to
Mr.
Quiverful
?
<EOS>
Had
Mr.
Harding
indeed
come
back
to
them
,
some
last
flicker
of
joyous
light
might
have
shone
forth
on
their
aged
cheeks
;
but
it
was
in
vain
to
bid
them
rejoice
because
Mr.
Quiverful
was
about
to
move
his
fourteen
children
from
Puddingdale
into
the
hospital
house
.
<EOS>
In
reality
they
did
no
doubt
receive
advantage
,
spiritual
as
well
as
corporal
,
but
this
they
could
neither
anticipate
nor
acknowledge
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
dull
affair
enough
,
this
introduction
of
Mr.
Quiverful
,
but
still
it
had
its
effect
.
<EOS>
The
good
which
Mr.
Harding
intended
did
not
fall
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
All
the
Barchester
world
,
including
the
five
old
bedesmen
,
treated
Mr.
Quiverful
with
the
more
respect
because
Mr.
Harding
had
thus
walked
in
,
arm
in
arm
with
him
,
on
his
first
entrance
to
his
duties
.
  
<EOS>
And
here
in
their
new
abode
we
will
leave
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Quiverful
and
their
fourteen
children
.
<EOS>
May
they
enjoy
the
good
things
which
Providence
has
at
length
given
to
them
!
    
<EOS>
Conclusion
  
<EOS>
The
end
of
a
novel
,
like
the
end
of
a
children
's
dinner
party
,
must
be
made
up
of
sweetmeats
and
sugar
-
plums
.
<EOS>
There
is
now
nothing
else
to
be
told
but
the
gala
doings
of
Mr.
Arabin
's
marriage
,
nothing
more
to
be
described
than
the
wedding
-
dresses
,
no
further
dialogue
to
be
recorded
than
that
which
took
place
between
the
archdeacon
,
who
married
them
,
and
Mr.
Arabin
and
Eleanor
,
who
were
married
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wilt
thou
have
this
woman
to
thy
wedded
wife
,
"
and
"
wilt
thou
have
this
man
to
thy
wedded
husband
,
to
live
together
according
to
God
's
ordinance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arabin
and
Eleanor
each
answered
,
"
I
will
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
have
no
doubt
that
they
will
keep
their
promises
,
the
more
especially
as
the
Signora
Neroni
had
left
Barchester
before
the
ceremony
was
performed
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bold
had
been
somewhat
more
than
two
years
a
widow
before
she
was
married
to
her
second
husband
,
and
little
Johnny
was
then
able
with
due
assistance
to
walk
on
his
own
legs
into
the
drawing
-
room
to
receive
the
salutations
of
the
assembled
guests
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harding
gave
away
the
bride
,
the
archdeacon
performed
the
service
,
and
the
two
Miss
Grantlys
,
who
were
joined
in
their
labours
by
other
young
ladies
of
the
neighbourhood
,
performed
the
duties
of
bridesmaids
with
equal
diligence
and
grace
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
superintended
the
breakfast
and
bouquets
,
and
Mary
Bold
distributed
the
cards
and
cake
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
's
three
sons
had
also
come
home
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
The
elder
was
great
with
learning
,
being
regarded
by
all
who
knew
him
as
a
certain
future
double
first
.
<EOS>
The
second
,
however
,
bore
the
palm
on
this
occasion
,
being
resplendent
in
a
new
uniform
.
<EOS>
The
third
was
just
entering
the
university
,
and
was
probably
the
proudest
of
the
three
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
most
remarkable
feature
in
the
whole
occasion
was
the
excessive
liberality
of
the
archdeacon
.
<EOS>
He
literally
made
presents
to
everybody
.
<EOS>
As
Mr.
Arabin
had
already
moved
out
of
the
parsonage
of
St.
Ewold
's
,
that
scheme
of
elongating
the
dining
-
room
was
of
course
abandoned
;
but
he
would
have
refurnished
the
whole
deanery
had
he
been
allowed
.
<EOS>
He
sent
down
a
magnificent
piano
by
Erard
,
gave
Mr.
Arabin
a
cob
which
any
dean
in
the
land
might
have
been
proud
to
bestride
,
and
made
a
special
present
to
Eleanor
of
a
new
pony
chair
that
had
gained
a
prize
in
the
Exhibition
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
even
stay
his
hand
here
;
he
bought
a
set
of
cameos
for
his
wife
and
a
sapphire
bracelet
for
Miss
Bold
;
showered
pearls
and
work
-
boxes
on
his
daughters
;
and
to
each
of
his
sons
he
presented
a
check
for
£
20
.
<EOS>
On
Mr.
Harding
he
bestowed
a
magnificent
violoncello
with
all
the
new
-
fashioned
arrangements
and
expensive
additions
,
which
on
account
of
these
novelties
that
gentleman
could
never
use
with
satisfaction
to
his
audience
or
pleasure
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Those
who
knew
the
archdeacon
well
perfectly
understood
the
causes
of
his
extravagance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twas
thus
that
he
sang
his
song
of
triumph
over
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
This
was
his
pæan
,
his
hymn
of
thanksgiving
,
his
loud
oration
.
<EOS>
He
had
girded
himself
with
his
sword
and
gone
forth
to
the
war
;
now
he
was
returning
from
the
field
laden
with
the
spoils
of
the
foe
.
<EOS>
The
cob
and
the
cameos
,
the
violoncello
and
the
pianoforte
,
were
all
as
it
were
trophies
reft
from
the
tent
of
his
now
-
conquered
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
The
Arabins
after
their
marriage
went
abroad
for
a
couple
of
months
,
according
to
the
custom
in
such
matters
now
duly
established
,
and
then
commenced
their
deanery
life
under
good
auspices
.
<EOS>
And
nothing
can
be
more
pleasant
than
the
present
arrangement
of
ecclesiastical
affairs
in
Barchester
.
<EOS>
The
titular
bishop
never
interfered
,
and
Mrs.
Proudie
not
often
.
<EOS>
Her
sphere
is
more
extended
,
more
noble
,
and
more
suited
to
her
ambition
than
that
of
a
cathedral
city
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
she
can
do
what
she
pleases
with
the
diocese
,
she
is
willing
to
leave
the
dean
and
chapter
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slope
tried
his
hand
at
subverting
the
old
-
established
customs
of
the
close
,
and
from
his
failure
she
had
learnt
experience
.
<EOS>
The
burly
chancellor
and
the
meagre
little
prebendary
are
not
teased
by
any
application
respecting
Sabbath
-
day
schools
,
the
dean
is
left
to
his
own
dominions
,
and
the
intercourse
between
Mrs.
Proudie
and
Mrs.
Arabin
is
confined
to
a
yearly
dinner
given
by
each
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
At
these
dinners
Dr.
Grantly
will
not
take
a
part
,
but
he
never
fails
to
ask
for
and
receive
a
full
account
of
all
that
Mrs.
Proudie
either
does
or
says
.
  
<EOS>
His
ecclesiastical
authority
has
been
greatly
shorn
since
the
palmy
days
in
which
he
reigned
supreme
as
mayor
of
the
palace
to
his
father
,
but
nevertheless
such
authority
as
is
now
left
to
him
he
can
enjoy
without
interference
.
<EOS>
He
can
walk
down
the
High
Street
of
Barchester
without
feeling
that
those
who
see
him
are
comparing
his
claims
with
those
of
Mr.
Slope
.
<EOS>
The
intercourse
between
Plumstead
and
the
deanery
is
of
the
most
constant
and
familiar
description
.
<EOS>
Since
Eleanor
has
been
married
to
a
clergyman
,
and
especially
to
a
dignitary
of
the
church
,
Mrs.
Grantly
has
found
many
more
points
of
sympathy
with
her
sister
;
and
on
a
coming
occasion
,
which
is
much
looked
forward
to
by
all
parties
,
she
intends
to
spend
a
month
or
two
at
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
She
never
thought
of
spending
a
month
in
Barchester
when
little
Johnny
Bold
was
born
!
  
<EOS>
The
two
sisters
do
not
quite
agree
on
matters
of
church
doctrine
,
though
their
differences
are
of
the
most
amicable
description
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Arabin
's
church
is
two
degrees
higher
than
that
of
Mrs.
<EOS>
Grantly
.
<EOS>
This
may
seem
strange
to
those
who
will
remember
that
Eleanor
was
once
accused
of
partiality
to
Mr.
Slope
,
but
it
is
no
less
the
fact
.
<EOS>
She
likes
her
husband
's
silken
vest
,
she
likes
his
adherence
to
the
rubric
,
she
specially
likes
the
eloquent
philosophy
of
his
sermons
,
and
she
likes
the
red
letters
in
her
own
prayer
-
book
.
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
presumed
that
she
has
a
taste
for
candles
,
or
that
she
is
at
all
astray
about
the
real
presence
,
but
she
has
an
inkling
that
way
.
<EOS>
She
sent
a
handsome
subscription
towards
certain
very
heavy
ecclesiastical
legal
expenses
which
have
lately
been
incurred
in
Bath
,
her
name
of
course
not
appearing
;
she
assumes
a
smile
of
gentle
ridicule
when
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
is
named
;
and
she
has
put
up
a
memorial
window
in
the
cathedral
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grantly
,
who
belongs
to
the
high
and
dry
church
,
the
High
Church
as
it
was
some
fifty
years
since
,
before
tracts
were
written
and
young
clergymen
took
upon
themselves
the
highly
meritorious
duty
of
cleaning
churches
,
rather
laughs
at
her
sister
.
<EOS>
She
shrugs
her
shoulders
and
tells
Miss
Thorne
that
she
supposes
Eleanor
will
have
an
oratory
in
the
deanery
before
she
has
done
.
<EOS>
But
she
is
not
on
that
account
a
whit
displeased
.
<EOS>
A
few
High
Church
vagaries
do
not
,
she
thinks
,
sit
amiss
on
the
shoulders
of
a
young
dean
's
wife
.
<EOS>
It
shows
at
any
rate
that
her
heart
is
in
the
subject
,
and
it
shows
moreover
that
she
is
removed
,
wide
as
the
poles
asunder
,
from
that
cesspool
of
abomination
in
which
it
was
once
suspected
that
she
would
wallow
and
grovel
.
<EOS>
Anathema
maranatha
!
<EOS>
Let
anything
else
be
held
as
blessed
,
so
that
that
be
well
cursed
.
<EOS>
Welcome
kneelings
and
bowings
,
welcome
matins
and
complines
,
welcome
bell
,
book
,
and
candle
,
so
that
Mr.
Slope
's
dirty
surplices
and
ceremonial
Sabbaths
be
held
in
due
execration
!
  
<EOS>
If
it
be
essentially
and
absolutely
necessary
to
choose
between
the
two
,
we
are
inclined
to
agree
with
Mrs.
Grantly
that
the
bell
,
book
,
and
candle
are
the
lesser
evil
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
Let
it
however
be
understood
that
no
such
necessity
is
admitted
in
these
pages
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Arabin
(
we
suppose
he
must
have
become
a
doctor
when
he
became
a
dean
)
is
more
moderate
and
less
outspoken
on
doctrinal
points
than
his
wife
,
as
indeed
in
his
station
it
behoves
him
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
studious
,
thoughtful
,
hard
-
working
man
.
<EOS>
He
lives
constantly
at
the
deanery
and
preaches
nearly
every
Sunday
.
<EOS>
His
time
is
spent
in
sifting
and
editing
old
ecclesiastical
literature
and
in
producing
the
same
articles
new
.
<EOS>
At
Oxford
he
is
generally
regarded
as
the
most
promising
clerical
ornament
of
the
age
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
wife
live
together
in
perfect
mutual
confidence
.
<EOS>
There
is
but
one
secret
in
her
bosom
which
he
has
not
shared
.
<EOS>
He
has
never
yet
learned
how
Mr.
Slope
had
his
ears
boxed
.
  
<EOS>
The
Stanhopes
soon
found
that
Mr.
Slope
's
power
need
no
longer
operate
to
keep
them
from
the
delight
of
their
Italian
villa
.
<EOS>
Before
Eleanor
's
marriage
they
had
all
migrated
back
to
the
shores
of
Como
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
been
resettled
long
before
the
signora
received
from
Mrs.
Arabin
a
very
pretty
though
very
short
epistle
,
in
which
she
was
informed
of
the
fate
of
the
writer
.
<EOS>
This
letter
was
answered
by
another
 
bright
,
charming
,
and
witty
,
as
the
signora
's
letters
always
were
 
and
so
ended
the
friendship
between
Eleanor
and
the
Stanhopes
.
  
<EOS>
One
word
of
Mr.
Harding
,
and
we
have
done
.
<EOS>
He
is
still
precentor
of
Barchester
and
still
pastor
of
the
little
church
of
St.
Cuthbert
's
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
what
he
has
so
often
said
himself
,
he
is
not
even
yet
an
old
man
.
<EOS>
He
does
such
duties
as
fall
to
his
lot
well
and
conscientiously
,
and
is
thankful
that
he
has
never
been
tempted
to
assume
others
for
which
he
might
be
less
fitted
.
  
<EOS>
The
author
now
leaves
him
in
the
hands
of
his
readers
:
not
as
a
hero
,
not
as
a
man
to
be
admired
and
talked
of
,
not
as
a
man
who
should
be
toasted
at
public
dinners
and
spoken
of
with
conventional
absurdity
as
a
perfect
divine
,
but
as
a
good
man
,
without
guile
,
believing
humbly
in
the
religion
which
he
has
striven
to
teach
,
and
guided
by
the
precepts
which
he
has
striven
to
learn
.
