 
_
Boy
and
Girl
_
  
Outside
Dorlcote
Mill
  
<EOS>
A
wide
plain
,
where
the
broadening
Floss
hurries
on
between
its
green
banks
to
the
sea
,
and
the
loving
tide
,
rushing
to
meet
it
<EOS>
,
checks
its
passage
with
an
impetuous
embrace
.
<EOS>
On
this
mighty
tide
the
black
ships
 
laden
with
the
fresh
-
scented
fir
-
planks
,
with
rounded
sacks
of
oil
-
bearing
seed
,
or
with
the
dark
glitter
of
coal
 
are
borne
along
to
the
town
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
which
shows
its
aged
,
fluted
red
roofs
and
the
broad
gables
of
its
wharves
between
the
low
wooded
hill
and
the
river
-
brink
,
tingeing
the
water
with
a
soft
purple
hue
under
the
transient
glance
of
this
February
sun
.
<EOS>
Far
away
on
each
hand
stretch
the
rich
pastures
,
and
the
patches
of
dark
earth
made
ready
for
the
seed
of
broad
-
leaved
green
crops
,
or
touched
already
with
the
tint
of
the
tender
-
bladed
autumn
-
sown
corn
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
remnant
still
of
last
year
's
golden
clusters
of
beehive
-
ricks
rising
at
intervals
beyond
the
hedgerows
;
and
everywhere
the
hedgerows
are
studded
with
trees
;
the
distant
ships
seem
to
be
lifting
their
masts
and
stretching
their
red
-
brown
sails
close
among
the
branches
of
the
spreading
ash
.
<EOS>
Just
by
the
red
-
roofed
town
the
tributary
Ripple
flows
with
a
lively
current
into
the
Floss
.
<EOS>
How
lovely
the
little
river
is
,
with
its
dark
changing
wavelets
!
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
like
a
living
companion
while
I
wander
along
the
bank
,
and
listen
to
its
low
,
placid
voice
,
as
to
the
voice
of
one
who
is
deaf
and
loving
.
<EOS>
I
remember
those
large
dipping
willows
.
<EOS>
I
remember
the
stone
bridge
.
  
<EOS>
And
this
is
Dorlcote
Mill
.
<EOS>
I
must
stand
a
minute
or
two
here
on
the
bridge
and
look
at
it
,
though
the
clouds
are
threatening
,
and
it
is
far
on
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Even
in
this
leafless
time
of
departing
February
it
is
pleasant
to
look
at
,
 
perhaps
the
chill
,
damp
season
adds
a
charm
to
the
trimly
kept
,
comfortable
dwelling
-
house
,
as
old
as
the
elms
and
chestnuts
that
shelter
it
from
the
northern
blast
.
<EOS>
The
stream
is
brimful
now
,
and
lies
high
in
this
little
withy
plantation
,
and
half
drowns
the
grassy
fringe
of
the
croft
in
front
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
As
I
look
at
the
full
stream
,
the
vivid
grass
,
the
delicate
bright
-
green
powder
softening
the
outline
of
the
great
trunks
and
branches
that
gleam
from
under
the
bare
purple
boughs
,
I
am
in
love
with
moistness
,
and
envy
the
white
ducks
that
are
dipping
their
heads
far
into
the
water
here
among
the
withes
,
unmindful
of
the
awkward
appearance
they
make
in
the
drier
world
above
.
  
<EOS>
The
rush
of
the
water
and
the
booming
of
the
mill
bring
a
dreamy
deafness
,
which
seems
to
heighten
the
peacefulness
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
They
are
like
a
great
curtain
of
sound
,
shutting
one
out
from
the
world
beyond
.
<EOS>
And
now
there
is
the
thunder
of
the
huge
covered
wagon
coming
home
with
sacks
of
grain
.
<EOS>
That
honest
wagoner
is
thinking
of
his
dinner
,
getting
sadly
dry
in
the
oven
at
this
late
hour
;
but
he
will
not
touch
it
till
he
has
fed
his
horses
,
 
the
strong
,
submissive
,
meek
-
eyed
beasts
,
who
,
I
fancy
,
are
looking
mild
reproach
at
him
from
between
their
blinkers
,
that
he
should
crack
his
whip
at
them
in
that
awful
manner
as
if
they
needed
that
hint
!
<EOS>
See
how
they
stretch
their
shoulders
up
the
slope
toward
the
bridge
,
with
all
the
more
energy
because
they
are
so
near
home
.
<EOS>
Look
at
their
grand
shaggy
feet
that
seem
to
grasp
the
firm
earth
,
at
the
patient
strength
of
their
necks
,
bowed
under
the
heavy
collar
,
at
the
mighty
muscles
of
their
struggling
haunches
!
<EOS>
I
should
like
well
to
hear
them
neigh
over
their
hardly
earned
feed
of
corn
,
and
see
them
,
with
their
moist
necks
freed
from
the
harness
,
dipping
their
eager
nostrils
into
the
muddy
pond
.
<EOS>
Now
they
are
on
the
bridge
,
and
down
they
go
again
at
a
swifter
pace
,
and
the
arch
of
the
covered
wagon
disappears
at
the
turning
behind
the
trees
.
  
<EOS>
Now
I
can
turn
my
eyes
toward
the
mill
again
,
and
watch
the
unresting
wheel
sending
out
its
diamond
jets
of
water
.
<EOS>
That
little
girl
is
watching
it
too
;
she
has
been
standing
on
just
the
same
spot
at
the
edge
of
the
water
ever
since
I
paused
on
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
And
that
queer
white
cur
with
the
brown
ear
seems
to
be
leaping
and
barking
in
ineffectual
remonstrance
with
the
wheel
;
perhaps
he
is
jealous
because
his
playfellow
in
the
beaver
bonnet
is
so
rapt
in
its
movement
.
<EOS>
It
is
time
the
little
playfellow
went
in
,
I
think
;
and
there
is
a
very
bright
fire
to
tempt
her
:
the
red
light
shines
out
under
the
deepening
gray
of
the
sky
.
<EOS>
It
is
time
,
too
,
for
me
to
leave
off
resting
my
arms
on
the
cold
stone
of
this
bridge
....
  
<EOS>
Ah
,
my
arms
are
really
benumbed
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
pressing
my
elbows
on
the
arms
of
my
chair
,
and
dreaming
that
I
was
standing
on
the
bridge
in
front
of
Dorlcote
Mill
,
as
it
looked
one
February
afternoon
many
years
ago
.
<EOS>
Before
I
dozed
off
,
I
was
going
to
tell
you
what
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
were
talking
about
,
as
they
sat
by
the
bright
fire
in
the
left
-
hand
parlor
,
on
that
very
afternoon
I
have
been
dreaming
of
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
,
of
Dorlcote
Mill
,
Declares
His
Resolution
about
Tom
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
want
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
 
"
what
I
want
is
to
give
Tom
a
good
eddication
;
an
eddication
as'll
be
a
bread
to
him
.
<EOS>
That
was
what
I
was
thinking
of
when
I
gave
notice
for
him
to
leave
the
academy
at
Lady
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
put
him
to
a
downright
good
school
at
Midsummer
.
<EOS>
The
two
years
at
th
'
academy
'
ud
ha
'
done
well
enough
,
if
I
'd
meant
to
make
a
miller
and
farmer
of
him
,
for
he
's
had
a
fine
sight
more
schoolin
'
nor
_
I
_
ever
got
.
<EOS>
All
the
learnin
'
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
my
_
father
ever
paid
for
was
<EOS>
a
bit
o
'
birch
at
one
end
and
the
alphabet
at
th
'
other
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
like
Tom
to
be
a
bit
of
a
scholard
,
so
as
he
might
be
up
to
the
tricks
<EOS>
o
'
these
fellows
as
talk
fine
and
write
with
a
flourish
.
<EOS>
It
'
ud
be
a
help
to
me
wi
'
these
lawsuits
,
and
arbitrations
,
and
things
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
make
a
downright
lawyer
o
'
<EOS>
the
lad
<EOS>
,
 
I
should
be
sorry
for
him
to
be
a
raskill
,
 
but
a
sort
o
'
engineer
,
or
a
surveyor
,
or
an
auctioneer
and
vallyer
,
like
Riley
,
or
one
o
'
<EOS>
them
smartish
businesses
as
are
all
profits
and
no
outlay
,
only
for
a
big
watch
-
chain
and
a
high
stool
.
<EOS>
They
're
pretty
nigh
all
one
,
and
they
're
not
far
off
being
even
wi
'
the
law
,
_
I
_
believe
;
for
Riley
looks
Lawyer
Wakem
<EOS>
i
'
the
face
as
hard
as
one
cat
looks
another

<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
's
_
none
frightened
at
him

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
was
speaking
to
his
wife
,
a
blond
comely
woman
in
a
fan
-
shaped
cap
<EOS>
(
I
am
afraid
to
think
how
long
it
is
<EOS>
since
fan
-
shaped
caps
were
worn
,
they
must
be
so
near
coming
in
again
.
<EOS>
At
that
time
,
when
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
nearly
forty
,
they
were
new
at
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
considered
sweet
things
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr.
Tulliver
,
you
know
best
:
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
've
_
no
objections
.
<EOS>
But
had
n't
I
better
kill
a
couple
o
'
fowl
,
and
have
th
'
aunts
and
uncles
to
dinner
next
week
,
so
as
you
may
hear
what
sister
Glegg
and
sister
Pullet
have
got
to
say
about
it
?
<EOS>
There
's
a
couple
o
'
fowl
<EOS>
_
wants
_
killing
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
kill
every
fowl
<EOS>
i
'
the
yard
<EOS>
if
you
like
,
Bessy
;
but
I
shall
ask
neither
aunt
nor
uncle
what
I
'm
to
do
wi
'
my
own
lad
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
defiantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
heart
!
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
shocked
at
this
sanguinary
rhetoric
,
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
talk
so
,
Mr.
Tulliver
?
<EOS>
But
it
's
your
way
to
speak
disrespectful
o
'
my
family
;
and
sister
Glegg
throws
all
the
blame
upo
'
me
,
though
I
'm
sure
I
'm
as
innocent
as
the
babe
unborn
.
<EOS>
For
nobody
's
ever
heard
me
say
as
it
was
n't
lucky
for
my
children
to
have
aunts
and
uncles
as
can
live
independent
.
<EOS>
Howiver
,
if
Tom
's
to
go
to
a
new
school
,
I
should
like
him
to
go
where
I
can
wash
him
and
mend
him
;
else
he
might
as
well
have
calico
as
linen
,
for
they
'd
be
one
as
yallow
as
th
'
other
before
they
'd
been
washed
half
-
a
-
dozen
times
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
when
the
box
is
goin'
back'ard
and
forrard
,
I
could
send
the
lad
a
cake
,
or
a
pork
-
pie
,
or
an
apple
;
for
he
can
do
with
an
extry
bit
,
bless
him
!
<EOS>
whether
they
stint
him
at
the
meals
or
no
.
<EOS>
My
children
can
eat
as
much
victuals
as
most
,
thank
God
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
we
wo
n't
send
him
out
<EOS>
o
'
reach
o
'
the
carrier
's
cart
,
if
other
things
fit
in
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
n't
put
a
spoke
<EOS>
i
'
the
wheel
about
the
washin
,
"
if
we
ca
n't
get
a
school
near
enough
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
fault
I
have
to
find
wi
'
you
,
Bessy
;
if
you
see
a
stick
i
'
the
road
,
you
're
allays
thinkin
<EOS>
'
you
ca
n't
step
over
it
.
<EOS>
You
'd
want
me
not
to
hire
a
good
wagoner
,
"
cause
he
'd
got
a
mole
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
heart
!
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
in
mild
surprise
,
"
when
did
I
iver
make
objections
to
a
man
because
he
'd
got
a
mole
on
his
face
?
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
'm
rether
<EOS>
fond
o
'
the
moles
;
for
my
brother
,
as
is
dead
an
'
gone
,
had
a
mole
on
his
brow
.
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
remember
your
iver
offering
to
hire
a
wagoner
with
a
mole
,
Mr.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
There
was
John
Gibbs
had
n't
a
mole
on
his
face
no
more
nor
you
have
,
an
'
I
was
all
for
having
you
hire
_
him
_
;
an
'
so
you
did
hire
him
,
an
'
if
he
had
n't
died
o
'
th
'
inflammation
,
as
we
paid
Dr.
Turnbull
for
attending
him
,
he
'd
very
like
<EOS>
ha
'
been
drivin
'
the
wagon
now
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
a
mole
somewhere
out
o
'
sight
,
but
how
was
I
to
know
that
,
Mr.
Tulliver
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
Bessy
;
I
did
n't
mean
justly
the
mole
;
I
meant
it
to
stand
for
summat
else
;
but
niver
mind
 
<EOS>
it
's
puzzling
work
,
talking
is
.
<EOS>
What
I
'm
thinking
on
,
is
how
to
find
the
right
sort
o
'
school
to
send
Tom
to
,
for
I
might
be
ta'en
in
again
,
as
I
've
been
wi
'
th
'
academy
.
<EOS>
I
'll
have
nothing
to
do
wi
'
a
"
cademy
again
:
<EOS>
whativer
school
<EOS>
I
send
Tom
to
<EOS>
,
it
sha'n"t
be
a
"
cademy
;
it
shall
be
a
place
where
the
lads
spend
their
time
<EOS>
i
'
summat
else
besides
blacking
the
family
's
shoes
,
and
getting
up
the
potatoes
.
<EOS>
It
's
an
uncommon
puzzling
thing
to
know
what
school
to
pick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
paused
a
minute
or
two
,
and
dived
with
both
hands
into
his
breeches
pockets
as
if
he
hoped
to
find
some
suggestion
there
.
<EOS>
Apparently
he
was
not
disappointed
,
for
he
presently
said
,
"
I
know
what
I
'll
do
:
<EOS>
I
'll
talk
it
over
wi
'
Riley
;
he
's
coming
to
-
morrow
,
t
"
arbitrate
about
the
dam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr.
Tulliver
,
I
've
put
the
sheets
out
for
the
best
bed
,
and
Kezia
's
got
'em
hanging
at
the
fire
.
<EOS>
They
are
n't
the
best
sheets
,
but
they
're
good
enough
for
anybody
to
sleep
in
,
be
he
who
he
will
;
for
as
for
them
best
Holland
sheets
,
I
should
repent
buying
'em
,
only
they
'll
do
to
lay
us
out
in
.
<EOS>
An
'
<EOS>
if
you
was
to
die
to
-
morrow
,
Mr.
Tulliver
,
they
're
mangled
beautiful
,
an
'
all
ready
,
an
'
smell
o
'
lavender
as
it
'
ud
be
a
pleasure
to
lay
'em
out
<EOS>
;
an
'
they
lie
at
<EOS>
the
left
-
hand
corner
o
'
the
big
oak
linen

chest
at
the
back
:
not
as
I
should
trust
anybody
to
look
'em
out
but
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
Mrs.
Tulliver
uttered
the
last
sentence
,
she
drew
a
bright
bunch
of
keys
from
her
pocket
,
and
singled
out
one
,
rubbing
her
thumb
and
finger
up
and
down
it
with
a
placid
smile
while
she
looked
at
the
clear
fire
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Tulliver
had
been
a
susceptible
man
in
his
conjugal
relation
,
he
might
have
supposed
that
she
drew
out
the
key
to
aid
her
imagination
in
anticipating
the
moment
when
he
would
be
in
a
state
to
justify
the
production
of
the
best
Holland
sheets
.
<EOS>
Happily
he
was
not
so
;
he
was
only
susceptible
in
respect
of
his
right
to
water
-
power
;
moreover
,
he
had
the
marital
habit
of
not
listening
very
closely
,
and
since
his
mention
of
Mr.
Riley
,
had
been
apparently
occupied
in
a
tactile
examination
of
his
woollen
stockings
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
've
hit
it
,
Bessy
,
"
was
his
first
remark
after
a
short
silence
.
<EOS>
"
Riley
's
as
likely
a
man
as
any
to
know
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
some
school
;
he
's
had
schooling
himself
,
an
'
goes
about
to
all
sorts
o
'
places
,
arbitratin
'
and
vallyin
'
and
that
.
<EOS>
And
we
shall
have
time
to
talk
it
over
to
-
morrow
night
when
the
business
is
done
.
<EOS>
I
want
Tom
to
be
such
a
sort
o
'
man
as
Riley
,
you
know
,
 
as
can
talk
pretty
nigh
as
well
as
if
it
was
all
wrote
out
for
him
,
and
knows
a
good
lot
o
'
words
as
do
n't
mean
much
,
so
as
you
ca
n't
lay
hold
of
'em
<EOS>
i
'
law
;
and
a
good
solid
knowledge
o
'
business
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
"
so
far
as
talking
proper
,
and
knowing
everything
,
and
walking
with
a
bend
in
his
back
,
and
setting
his
hair
up
,
I
should
n't
mind
the
lad
being
brought
up
to
that
.
<EOS>
But
them
fine
-
talking
men
from
the
big
towns
mostly
wear
the
false
shirt
-
fronts
;
they
wear
a
frill
till
it
's
all
a
mess
,
and
then
hide
it
with
a
bib
;
I
know
Riley
does
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
if
Tom
's
to
go
and
live
at
Mudport
,
like
Riley
,
he
'll
have
a
house
with
a
kitchen
hardly
big
enough
to
turn
in
,
an
'
niver
get
a
fresh
egg
for
his
breakfast
,
an
'
sleep
up
three
pair
o
'
stairs
,
 
or
four
,
for
what
I
know
,
 
and
be
burnt
to
death
before
he
can
get
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
"
I
've
no
thoughts
of
his
going
to
Mudport
:
<EOS>
I
mean
him
to
set
up
his
office
at
St.
Ogg
's
,
close
by
us
,
an
'
live
at
home
.
<EOS>
But
,
"
continued
Mr.
Tulliver
after
a
pause
,
"
what
I
'm
a
bit
afraid
on
is
,
as
Tom
has
n't
got
the
right
sort
<EOS>
o
'
brains
for
a
smart
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
he
's
a
bit
slowish
.
<EOS>
He
takes
after
your
family
,
Bessy
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
that
he
does
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
accepting
the
last
proposition
entirely
on
its
own
merits
;
"
he
's
wonderful
for
liking
a
deal
o
'
salt
in
his
broth
.
<EOS>
That
was
my
brother
's
way
,
and
my
father
's
before
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
a
bit
a
pity
,
though
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
"
as
the
lad
should
take
after
the
mother
's
side
instead
o
'
the
little
wench
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
worst
on't
<EOS>
wi
'
crossing
o
'
breeds
:
you
can
never
justly
calkilate
what
'll
come
on't
.
<EOS>
The
little
un
takes
after
my
side
,
now
:
she
's
twice
as
"
cute
as
Tom
.
<EOS>
Too
"
cute
for
a
woman
,
I
'm
afraid
,
"
continued
Mr.
Tulliver
,
turning
his
head
dubiously
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
mischief
much
while
she
's
a
little
un
;
but
an
over
 
"
cute
woman
's
no
better
nor
a
long
-
tailed
sheep
,
 
she
'll
fetch
none
the
bigger
price
for
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
_
is
_
a
mischief
while
she
's
a
little
un
,
Mr.
Tulliver
,
for
it
runs
to
naughtiness
.
<EOS>
How
to
keep
her
in
a
clean
pinafore
two
hours
together
passes
my
cunning
.
<EOS>
An
'
now
you
put
me
i
'
mind
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
rising
and
going
to
the
window
,
"
I
do
n't
know
where
she
is
now
,
an
'
it
's
pretty
nigh
tea
-
time
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
I
thought
so
,
 
wanderin
'
up
an
'
down
by
the
water
,
like
a
wild
thing
:
She
'll
tumble
in
some
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
rapped
the
window
sharply
,
beckoned
,
and
shook
her
head
,
 
a
process
which
she
repeated
more
than
once
before
she
returned
to
her
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
talk
o
'
"
cuteness
,
Mr.
Tulliver
,
<EOS>
"
she
observed
as
she
sat
down
,
"
but
I
'm
sure
the
child
's
half
an
idiot
<EOS>
i
'
some
things
;
for
if
I
send
her
upstairs
to
fetch
anything
,
she
forgets
what
she
's
gone
for
,
an
'
perhaps
"
ull
sit
down
on
the
floor
<EOS>
i
'
the
sunshine

plait
her
hair
an
'
sing
to
herself

a
Bedlam

,
all
the
while
I
'm
waiting
for
her
downstairs
.
<EOS>
That
niver

my

thank
God
!
<EOS>
no
more
nor
a
brown
skin
as
makes
her
look
like
a
mulatter
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
to
fly
<EOS>
i
'
the
face
o
'
<EOS>
Providence
,
but
<EOS>
it
seems
hard
as
I
should
have
but
one
gell
,
an
'
her
so
comical
.
"
  
"
Pooh
,
nonsense
!
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
;
"
she
's
a
straight
,
black
-
eyed
wench
as
anybody
need
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
i
<EOS>
'
what
she
's
behind
other
folks

children
<EOS>
;
and
she
can
read
almost
as
well
as
the
parson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
her
hair
wo
n't
curl
all
I
can
do
with
it
,
and
she
's
so
franzy
about
having
it
put
i
'
paper
,
and
I
've
such
work
as
never
was
to
make
her
stand
and
have
it
pinched
with
th
'
irons
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cut
it
off
 
cut
it
off
short
,
"
said
the
father
,
rashly
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
talk
so
,
Mr.
Tulliver
?
<EOS>
She
's
too
big
a
gell
 
<EOS>
gone
nine
,
and
tall
of
her
age
 
to
have
her
hair
cut
short

an

her

a

curls
round
her
head

an
'
not
a

out

place

<EOS>
It
seems
hard
as
my
sister
Deane
should
have
that
pretty
child
;
I
'm
sure
Lucy
takes
more
after
me
nor
my
own
child
does

Maggie

"
continued
the
mother
,
in
a
tone
of
half
-
coaxing
fretfulness
,
as
this
small
mistake
of
nature
entered
the
room
,
"
where
's
the
use
<EOS>
o
'
my
telling
you
to
keep
away
from
the
water
?
<EOS>
You
'll
tumble

be
drownded
some
day
<EOS>
,
an

then
you
'll
be
sorry
you

n't
do
as
mother
told
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
hair
,
as
she
threw
off
her
bonnet
,
painfully
confirmed
her
mother
's
accusation
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
desiring
her
daughter
to
have
a
curled
crop
,
"
like
other
folks
's
children
,
"
had
had
it
cut
too
short
in
front
to
be
pushed
behind
the
ears
;
and
as
it
was
usually
straight
an
hour
after
it
had
been
taken
out
of
paper
,
Maggie
was
incessantly
tossing
her
head
to
keep
the
dark
,
heavy
locks
out
of
her
gleaming
black
eyes
,
 
an
action
which
gave
her
very
much
the
air
of
a
small
Shetland
pony
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
,
oh
,
dear
,
Maggie
,
what
are
you
thinkin

of

to
throw
your
bonnet
down
there
?
<EOS>
Take
it
upstairs

's
a

put

for

your
patchwork

like
a
little

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh

mother

"
said
Maggie
,
in
a
vehemently
cross
tone
,
"
I
do
n't
_
want
_
to
do
my
patchwork

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What

<EOS>
not
your
pretty
patchwork

a
counterpane
for
your
aunt
Glegg

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
foolish
work
,
"
said
Maggie
,
with
a
toss
of
her
mane
,
 
"
tearing
things
to
pieces
to
sew
'em
together
again
.
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
want
to
do
anything
for
my
aunt
Glegg
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Exit
Maggie
,
dragging
her
bonnet
by
the
string
,
while
Mr.
Tulliver
laughs
audibly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
at
you
,
as
you
'll
laugh
at
her
,
Mr.
Tulliver
,
"
said
the
mother
,
with
feeble
fretfulness
in
her
tone
.
<EOS>
"
You
encourage
her
<EOS>
i
'
naughtiness
.
<EOS>
An
'
her
aunts
will
have
it
as
it
's
me
spoils
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
what
is
called
a
good
-
tempered
person
,
 
never
cried
,
when
she
was
a
baby
,
on
any
slighter
ground
than
hunger
and
pins
;
and
from
the
cradle
upward
had
been
healthy
,
fair
,
plump
,
and
dull
-
witted
;
in
short
,
the
flower
of
her
family
for
beauty
and
amiability
.
<EOS>
But
milk
and
mildness
are
not
the
best
things
for
keeping
,
and
when
they
turn
only
a
little
sour
,
they
may
disagree
with
young
stomachs
seriously
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
wondered
whether
those
early
Madonnas
of
Raphael
,
with
the
blond
faces
and
somewhat
stupid
expression
,
kept
their
placidity
undisturbed
when
their
strong
-
limbed
,
strong
-
willed
boys
got
a
little
too
old
to
do
without
clothing
.
<EOS>
I
think
they
must
have
been
given
to
feeble
remonstrance
,
getting
more
and
more
peevish
as
it
became
more
and
more
ineffectual
.

His
Advice
Concerning
a
School
for
Tom

The
gentleman
in
the
ample
white
cravat
and
shirt
-
frill
,
taking
his
brandy
-
and
-
water
so
pleasantly
with
his
good
friend
Tulliver
,
is
Mr.
Riley
,
a
gentleman
with
a
waxen
complexion
and
fat
hands
,
rather
highly
educated
for
an
auctioneer
and
appraiser
,
but
large
-
hearted
enough
to
show
a
great
deal
of
_
bonhomie
_
toward
simple
country
acquaintances
of
hospitable
habits
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Riley
spoke
of
such
acquaintances
kindly
as
"
people
of
the
old
school
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
conversation
had
come
to
a
pause
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
,
not
without
a
particular
reason
,
had
abstained
from
a
seventh
recital
of
the
cool
retort
by
which
Riley
had
shown
himself
too
many
for
Dix
,
and
how
Wakem
had
had
his
comb
cut
for
once
in
his
life
,
now
the
business
of
the
dam
had
been
settled
by
arbitration
,
and
how
there
never
would
have
been
any
dispute
at
all
about
the
height
of
water
if
everybody
was
what
they
should
be
,
and
Old
Harry
had
n't
made
the
lawyers
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
was
,
on
the
whole
,
a
man
of
safe
traditional
opinions
;
but
on
one
or
two
points
he
had
trusted
to
his
unassisted
intellect
,
and
had
arrived
at
several
questionable
conclusions
;
amongst
the
rest
,
that
rats
,
weevils
,
and
lawyers
were
created
by
Old
Harry
.
<EOS>
Unhappily
he
had
no
one
to
tell
him
that
this
was
rampant
Manichæism
,
else
he
might
have
seen
his
error
.
<EOS>
But
to
-
day
it
was
clear
that
the
good
principle
was
triumphant
:
this
affair
of
the
water
-
power
had
been
a
tangled
business
<EOS>
somehow
,
for
all
it
seemed
 
look
at
it
one
way
 
as
plain
as
water
's
water
;
but
,
big
a
puzzle
as
it
was
,
it
had
n't
got
the
better
of
Riley
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
took
his
brandy
-
and
-
water
a
little
stronger
than
usual
,
and
,
for
a
man
who
might
be
supposed
to
have
a
few
hundreds
lying
idle
at
his
banker
's
,
was
rather
incautiously
open
in
expressing
his
high
estimate
of
his
friend
's
business
talents
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
dam
was
a
subject
of
conversation
that
would
keep
;
it
could
always
be
taken
up
again
at
the
same
point
,
and
exactly
in
the
same
condition
;
and
there
was
another
subject
,
as
you
know
,
on
which
Mr.
Tulliver
was
in
pressing
want
of
Mr.
Riley
's
advice
.
<EOS>
This
was
his
particular
reason
for
remaining
silent
for
a
short
space
after
his
last
draught
,
and
rubbing
his
knees
in
a
meditative
manner
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
man
to
make
an
abrupt
transition
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
puzzling
world
,
as
he
often
said
,
and
if
you
drive
your
wagon
in
a
hurry
,
you
may
light
on
an
awkward
corner
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Riley
,
meanwhile
,
was
not
impatient
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
be
?
<EOS>
Even
Hotspur
,
one
would
think
,
must
have
been
patient
in
his
slippers
on
a
warm
hearth
,
taking
copious
snuff
,
and
sipping
gratuitous
brandy
-
and
-
water
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
thing
I
've
got
i
'
my
head
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
at
last
,
in
rather
a
lower
tone
than
usual
,
as
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
steadfastly
at
his
companion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr.
Riley
,
in
a
tone
of
mild
interest
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
with
heavy
waxen
eyelids
and
high
-
arched
eyebrows
,
looking
exactly
the
same
under
all
circumstances
.
<EOS>
This
immovability
of
face
,
and
the
habit
of
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
before
he
gave
an
answer
,
made
him
trebly
oracular
to
Mr.
Tulliver
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
very
particular
thing
,
"
he
went
on
;
"
it
's
about
my
boy
Tom
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
the
sound
of
this
name
,
Maggie
,
who
was
seated
on
a
low
stool
close
by
the
fire
,
with
a
large
book
open
on
her
lap
,
shook
her
heavy
hair
back
and
looked
up
eagerly
.
<EOS>
There
were
few
sounds
that
roused
Maggie
when
she
was
dreaming
over
her
book
,
but
Tom
's
name
served
as
well
as
the
shrillest
whistle
;
in
an
instant
she
was
on
the
watch
,
with
gleaming
eyes
,
like
a
Skye
terrier
suspecting
mischief
,
or
at
all
events
determined
to
fly
at
any
one
who
threatened
it
toward
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
I
want
to
put
him
to
a
new
school
at
Midsummer
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
;
"
he
's
comin
'
away
from
the
"
cademy
at
Lady
-
day
<EOS>
,
an
'
I
shall
let
him
run
loose
for
a
quarter
;
but
after
that
I
want
to
send
him
to
a
downright
good
school
,
where
they
'll
make
a
scholard
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr.
Riley
,
"
there
's
no
greater
advantage
you
can
give
him
than
a
good
education
.
<EOS>
Not
,
"
he
added
,
with
polite
significance
,
 
"
not
that
a
man
ca
n't
be
an
excellent
miller
and
farmer
,
and
a
shrewd
,
sensible
fellow
into
the
bargain
,
without
much
help
from
the
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
winking
,
and
turning
his
head
on
one
side
;
"
but
that
's
where
it
is
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
_
mean
_
Tom
to
be
a
miller
and
farmer
.
<EOS>
I
see
no
fun
<EOS>
i
'
that
.
<EOS>
Why
,
if
I
made
him
a
miller
an
'
farmer
,
he
'd
be
expectin
'
to
take
to
the
mill
an
'
the
land
,
an
'
a
-
hinting
at
me
as
it
was
time
for
me
to
lay
by
an
'
think
o
'
my
latter
end
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
nay
,
I
've
seen
enough
o
'
that
wi
'
sons
.
<EOS>
I
'll
never
pull
my
coat
off
before
I
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
I
shall
give
Tom
an
eddication
an
'
put
him
to
a
business
,
as
he
may
make
a
nest
for
himself
,
an
'
not
want
to
push
me
out
o
'
mine
.
<EOS>
Pretty
well
if
he
gets
it
when
I
'm
dead
<EOS>
an
'
gone
.
<EOS>
I
sha'n"t
be
put
off
wi
'
spoon
-
meat
afore
<EOS>
I
've
lost
my
teeth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
evidently
a
point
on
which
Mr.
Tulliver
felt
strongly
;
and
the
impetus
which
had
given
unusual
rapidity
and
emphasis
to
his
speech
showed
itself
still
unexhausted
for
some
minutes
afterward
in
a
defiant
motion
of
the
head
from
side
to
side
,
and
an
occasional
"
Nay
,
nay
,
"
like
a
subsiding
growl
.
  
<EOS>
These
angry
symptoms
were
keenly
observed
by
Maggie
,
and
cut
her
to
the
quick
.
<EOS>
Tom
,
it
appeared
,
was
supposed
capable
of
turning
his
father
out
of
doors
,
and
of
making
the
future
in
some
way
tragic
by
his
wickedness
.
<EOS>
This
was
not
to
be
borne
;
and
Maggie
jumped
up
from
her
stool
,
forgetting
all
about
her
heavy
book
,
which
fell
with
a
bang
within
the
fender
,
and
going
up
between
her
father
's
knees
,
said
,
in
a
half
-
crying
,
half
-
indignant
voice
,
    
"
Father
,
Tom
would
n't
be
naughty
to
you
ever
;
<EOS>
I
know
he
would
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
out
of
the
room
superintending
a
choice
supper
-
dish
,
and
Mr.
Tulliver
's
heart
was
touched
;
so
Maggie
was
not
scolded
about
the
book
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Riley
quietly
picked
it
up
and
looked
at
it
,
while
the
father
laughed
,
with
a
certain
tenderness
in
his
hard
-
lined
face
,
and
patted
his
little
girl
on
the
back
,
and
then
held
her
hands
and
kept
her
between
his
knees
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
they
must
n't
say
any
harm
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
Tom
,
eh
?
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
looking
at
Maggie
with
a
twinkling
eye
.
<EOS>
Then
,
in
a
lower
voice
,
turning
to
Mr.
Riley
,
as
though
Maggie
could
n't
hear
,
"
She
understands
what
one
's
talking
about
so
as
never
was
.
<EOS>
And
you
should
hear
her
read
,
 
straight
off
,
as
if
she
knowed
it
all
beforehand
.
<EOS>
And
allays
at
her
book
!
<EOS>
But
it
's
bad
 
<EOS>
it
's
bad
,
"
Mr.
Tulliver
added
sadly
,
checking
this
blamable
exultation
.
"
<EOS>
A
woman
's
no
business
wi
'
being
so
clever
;
it
'll
turn
to
trouble
,
I
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
bless
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
here
the
exultation
was
clearly
recovering
the
mastery
,
 
"
she
'll
read
the
books
and
understand
'em
better
nor
half
the
folks
as
are
growed
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
cheeks
began
to
flush
with
triumphant
excitement
.
<EOS>
She
thought
Mr.
Riley
would
have
a
respect
for
her
now
;
it
had
been
evident
that
he
thought
nothing
of
her
before
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Riley
was
turning
over
the
leaves
of
the
book
,
and
she
could
make
nothing
of
his
face
,
with
its
high
-
arched
eyebrows
;
but
he
presently
looked
at
her
,
and
said
,
    
"
Come
,
come
and
tell
me
something
about
this
book
;
here
are
some
pictures
,
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
what
they
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
,
with
deepening
color
,
went
without
hesitation
to
Mr.
Riley
's
elbow
and
looked
over
the
book
,
eagerly
seizing
one
corner
,
and
tossing
back
her
mane
,
while
she
said
,
    
"
Oh
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
that
means
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
dreadful
picture
,
is
n't
it
?
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
help
looking
at
it
.
<EOS>
That
old
woman
in
the
water
's
a
witch
,
 
they
've
put
her
in
to
find
out
whether
she
's
a
witch
or
no
;
and
if
she
swims
<EOS>
she
's
a
witch
,
and
if
she
's
drowned
 
and
killed
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
she
's
innocent
,
and
not
a
witch
,
but
only
a
poor
silly
old
woman
.
<EOS>
But
what
good
would
it
do
her
then
,
you
know
,
when
she
was
drowned
?
<EOS>
Only
,
I
suppose
,
she
'd
go
to
heaven
,
and
God
would
make
it
up
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
this
dreadful
blacksmith
with
his
arms
akimbo
,
laughing
,
 
<EOS>
oh
,
is
n't
he
ugly
?
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
he
is
.
<EOS>
He
's
the
Devil
_
<EOS>
really
_
"
(
here
Maggie
's
voice
became
louder
and
more
emphatic
)
,
"
and
not
a
right
blacksmith
;
for
the
Devil
takes
the
shape
of
wicked
men
,
and
walks
about
and
sets
people
doing
wicked
things
,
and
he
's
oftener
in
the
shape
of
a
bad
man
than
any
other
,
because
,
you
know
,
if
people
saw
he
was
the
Devil
,
and
he
roared
at
'em
,
they
'd
run
away
,
and
he
could
n't
make
'em
do
what
he
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
had
listened
to
this
exposition
of
Maggie
's
with
petrifying
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
book
is
it
<EOS>
the
wench
has
got
hold
on
?
<EOS>
"
he
burst
out
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
"
History
of
the
Devil
,
"
by
Daniel
Defoe
,
 
not
quite
the
right
book
for
a
little
girl
,
"
said
Mr.
Riley
.
<EOS>
"
How
came
it
among
your
books
,
Mr.
Tulliver
?
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
looked
hurt
and
discouraged
,
while
her
father
said
,
    
"
Why
,
it
's
one
<EOS>
o
'
the
books
I
bought
at
Partridge
's
sale
.
<EOS>
They
was
all
bound
alike
,
 
<EOS>
it
's
a
good
binding
<EOS>
,
you
see
,
 
<EOS>
and
I
thought
they
'd
be
all
good
books
.
<EOS>
There
's
Jeremy
Taylor
's
"
Holy
Living
and
Dying
"
among
'em
.
<EOS>
I
read
in
it
often
of
a
Sunday
"
<EOS>
(
Mr.
Tulliver
felt
somehow
a
familiarity
with
that
great
writer
,
because
his
name
was
Jeremy
)
;
"
and
there
's
a
lot
more
of
'em
,
 
sermons
mostly
,
I
think
,
 
<EOS>
but
they
've
all
got
the
same
covers
,
and
I
thought
they
were
all
o
'
one
sample
,
as
you
may
say
.
<EOS>
But
it
seems
one
must
n't
judge
by
th
'
outside
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
puzzlin
'
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr.
Riley
,
in
an
admonitory
,
patronizing
tone
as
he
patted
Maggie
on
the
head
,
"
I
advise
you
to
put
by
the
"
History
of
the
Devil
,
"
and
read
some
prettier
book
.
<EOS>
Have
you
no
prettier
books
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
said
Maggie
,
reviving
a
little
in
the
desire
to
vindicate
the
variety
of
her
reading
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
reading
in
this
book
is
n't
pretty
;
but
I
like
the
pictures
,
and
I
make
stories
to
the
pictures
out
of
my
own
head
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
But
I
've
got
"
Æsop
's
Fables
,
"
and
a
book
about
Kangaroos
and
things
,
and
the
"
Pilgrim
's
Progress
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
,
a
beautiful
book
,
"
said
Mr.
Riley
;
"
you
ca
n't
read
a
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
there
's
a
great
deal
about
the
Devil
in
that
,
"
said
Maggie
,
triumphantly
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
'll
show
you
the
picture
of
him
in
his
true
shape
,
as
he
fought
with
Christian
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
ran
in
an
instant
to
the
corner
of
the
room
,
jumped
on
a
chair
,
and
reached
down
from
the
small
bookcase
a
shabby
old
copy
of
Bunyan
,
which
opened
at
once
,
without
the
least
trouble
of
search
,
at
the
picture
she
wanted
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
he
is
,
"
she
said
,
running
back
to
Mr.
Riley
,
"
and
Tom
colored
him
for
me
with
his
paints
when
he
was
at
home
last
holidays
,
 
the
body
all
black
,
you
know
,
and
the
eyes
red
,
like
fire
,
because
he
's
all
fire
inside
,
and
it
shines
out
at
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
,
go
!
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
peremptorily
,
beginning
to
feel
rather
uncomfortable
at
these
free
remarks
on
the
personal
appearance
of
a
being
powerful
enough
to
create
lawyers
;
"
shut
up
the
book
,
and
let
's
hear
no
more
<EOS>
o
'
such
talk
.
<EOS>
It
is
as
I
thought
 
the
child
"
ull
learn
more
mischief
nor
good
<EOS>
wi
'
the
books
.
<EOS>
Go
,
go
and
see
after
your
mother
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
shut
up
the
book
at
once
,
with
a
sense
of
disgrace
,
but
not
being
inclined
to
see
after
her
mother
,
she
compromised
the
matter
by
going
into
a
dark
corner
behind
her
father
's
chair
,
and
nursing
her
doll
,
toward
which
she
had
an
occasional
fit
of
fondness
in
Tom
's
absence
,
neglecting
its
toilet
,
but
lavishing
so
many
warm
kisses
on
it
that
the
waxen
cheeks
had
a
wasted
,
unhealthy
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
hear
the
like
on't
?
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
as
Maggie
retired
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
pity
but
what
she
'd
been
the
lad
,
 
she
'd
ha
'
been
a
match
for
the
lawyers
,
_
she
_
would
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
wonderful'st
thing
"
 
<EOS>
here
he
lowered
his
voice
 
"
as
I
picked
the
mother
because
she
was
n't
o'er
"
cute
 
bein
'
a
good
-
looking
woman
too
,
an
'
come
of
a
rare
family
for
managing
;
but
I
picked
her
from
her
sisters
o
'
purpose
,
"
cause
she
was
a
bit
weak
like
;
for
I
was
n't
agoin
'
to
be
told
the
rights
o
'
things
by
my
own
fireside
.
<EOS>
But
you
see
when
a
man
's
got
brains
himself
,
there
's
no
knowing
where
they
'll
run
to
;
an
'
a
pleasant
sort
o
'
soft
woman
may
go
on
breeding
you
stupid
lads
and
"
cute
wenches
,
till
it
's
like
as
if
the
world
was
turned
topsy
-
turvy
.
<EOS>
It
's
an
uncommon
puzzlin
'
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Riley
's
gravity
gave
way
,
and
he
shook
a
little
under
the
application
of
his
pinch
of
snuff
before
he
said
,
    
"
<EOS>
But
your
lad
's
not
stupid
,
is
he
?
<EOS>
I
saw
him
,
when
I
was
here
last
,
busy
making
fishing
-
tackle
;
he
seemed
quite
up
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
he
is
n't
not
to
say
stupid
,
 
<EOS>
he
's
got
a
notion
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
things
out
o
'
door
,
an
'
a
sort
o
'
common
sense
,
as
he
'd
lay
hold
<EOS>
o
'
things
by
the
right
handle
.
<EOS>
But
he
's
slow
with
his
tongue
,
you
see
,
and
he
reads
but
poorly
,
and
ca
n't
abide
the
books
,
and
spells
all
wrong
,
they
tell
me
,
an
'
as
shy
as
can
be
wi
'
strangers
,
an
'
you
never
hear
him
say
"
cute
things
like
the
little
wench
.
<EOS>
Now
,
what
I
want
is
to
send
him
to
a
school
where
they
'll
make
him
a
bit
nimble
with
his
tongue
and
his
pen
,
and
make
a
smart
chap
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
want
my
son
to
be
even
wi
'
<EOS>
these
fellows
as
have
got
the
start
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
'
me
with
having
better
schooling
.
<EOS>
Not
but
what
,
if
the
world
had
been
left
as
God
made
it
,
I
could
ha
'
seen
my
way
,

held
my
own
wi

the
best
of

but
things
have
got
so
twisted
round
and
wrapped
up
i
'
unreasonable
words
,
as
are
n't
a
bit
like
'em
,
as
I
'm
clean
at

often

often

<EOS>
Everything
winds
about

so
 
the
more
straightforrad

are
,
the
more
you
're
puzzled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
took
a
draught
,
swallowed
it
slowly
,
and
shook
his
head
in
a
melancholy
manner
,
conscious
of
exemplifying
the
truth
that
a
perfectly
sane
intellect
is
hardly
at
home
in
this
insane
world
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
quite
in
the
right
of
it
,
Tulliver
,
"
observed
Mr.
Riley
.
<EOS>
"
Better
spend
an
extra
hundred
or
two
on
your
son
's
education
,
than
leave
it
him
in
your
will
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
should
have
tried
to
do
so
by
a
son
of
mine
,
if
I
'd
had
one
,
though
,
God
knows
,
I
have
n't
your
ready
money
to
play
with
,
Tulliver
;
and
I
have
a
houseful
of
daughters
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
,
now
,
you
know
of
a
school
as
'
ud
be
just
the
thing
for
Tom
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
not
diverted
from
his
purpose
by
any
sympathy
with
Mr.
Riley
's
deficiency
of
ready
cash
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Riley
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
and
kept
Mr.
Tulliver
in
suspense
by
a
silence
that
seemed
deliberative
,
before
he
said
,
    
"
I
know
of
a
very
fine
chance
for
any
one
that
's
got
the
necessary
money
<EOS>
and
that
's
what
you
have
,
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
I
would
n't
recommend
any
friend
of
mine
to
send
a
boy
to
a
regular
school
,
if
he
could
afford
to
do
better
.
<EOS>
But
if
any
one
wanted
his
boy
to
get
superior
instruction
and
training
,
where
he
would
be
the
companion
of
his
master
,
and
that
master
a
first
rate
fellow
,
I
know
his
man
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
mention
the
chance
to
everybody
,
because
I
do
n't
think
everybody
would
succeed
in
getting
it
,
if
he
were
to
try
;
but
I
mention
it
to
you
,
Tulliver
,
between
ourselves
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
fixed
inquiring
glance
with
which
Mr.
Tulliver
had
been
watching
his
friend
's
oracular
face
became
quite
eager
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
now
,
let
's
hear
,
"
he
said
,
adjusting
himself
in
his
chair
with
the
complacency
of
a
person
who
is
thought
worthy
of
important
communications
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
an
Oxford
man
,
"
said
Mr.
Riley
,
sententiously
,
shutting
his
mouth
close
,
and
looking
at
Mr.
Tulliver
to
observe
the
effect
of
this
stimulating
information
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
a
parson
?
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
rather
doubtfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
an
M.A.
<EOS>
The
bishop
,
I
understand
,
thinks
very
highly
of
him
:
why
,
it
was
the
bishop
who
got
him
his
present
curacy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
?
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
to
whom
one
thing
was
as
wonderful
as
another
concerning
these
unfamiliar
phenomena
.
<EOS>
"
But
what
can
he
want
wi
'
Tom
,
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
fact
is
,
he
's
fond
of
teaching
,
and
wishes
to
keep
up
his
studies
,
and
a
clergyman
has
but
little
opportunity
for
that
in
his
parochial
duties
.
<EOS>
He
's
willing
to
take
one
or
two
boys
as
pupils
to
fill
up
his
time
profitably
.
<EOS>
The
boys
would
be
quite
of
the
family
,
 
the
finest
thing
in
the
world
for
them
;
under
Stelling
's
eye
continually
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
do
you
think
they
'd
give
the
poor
lad
twice
o
'
pudding
?
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
who
was
now
in
her
place
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
such
a
boy
for
pudding
as
never
was
;
an
'
a
growing
boy
like
that
,
 
<EOS>
it
's
dreadful
to
think
o
'
their
stintin
'
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
money
'
ud
he
want
?
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
whose
instinct
told
him
that
the
services
of
this
admirable
M.A.
would
bear
a
high
price
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
know
of
a
clergyman
who
asks
a
hundred
and
fifty
with
his
youngest
pupils
,
and
he
's
not
to
be
mentioned
with
Stelling
,
the
man
I
speak
of
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
on
good
authority
,
that
one
of
the
chief
people
at
Oxford
said
,
Stelling
might
get
the
highest
honors
if
he
chose
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
n't
care
about
university
honors
;
he
's
a
quiet
man
 
not
noisy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
a
deal
better
 
<EOS>
a
deal
better
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
;
"
but
a
hundred
and
fifty
's
an
uncommon
price
.
<EOS>
I
never
thought
o
'
paying
so
much
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
good
education
,
let
me
tell
you
,
Tulliver
,
 
a
good
education
is
cheap
at
the
money
.
<EOS>
But
Stelling
is
moderate
in
his
terms
;
he
's
not
a
grasping
man
.
<EOS>
I
've
no
doubt
he
'd
take
your
boy
at
a
hundred
,
and
that
's
what
you
would
n't
get
many
other
clergymen
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
'll
write
to
him
about
it
,
if
you
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
rubbed
his
knees
,
and
looked
at
the
carpet
in
a
meditative
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
belike
he
's
a
bachelor
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
in
the
interval
;
"
an
'
I
've
no
opinion
o
'
housekeepers
.
<EOS>
There
was
my
brother
,
as
is
dead
an
'
gone
,
had
a
housekeeper
once
,
an
'
<EOS>
she
took
half
the
feathers
out
o
'
the
best
bed
,
an
'
packed
'em
up
an
'
sent
'em
away

<EOS>
An
'
<EOS>
it
's
unknown
the
linen
she
made
away
with
 
Stott
<EOS>
her
name
was
.
<EOS>
It
'
ud
break
my
heart
to
send
Tom
where
there
's
a
housekeeper
<EOS>
,
an
'
I
hope
you
wo
n't
think
of
it
,
Mr.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
on
that
score
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
"
said
Mr.
Riley
,
"
for
Stelling
is
married
to
as
nice
a
little
woman
as
any
man
need
wish
for
a
wife
.
<EOS>
There
is
n't
a
kinder
little
soul
in
the
world
;
I
know
her
family
well
.
<EOS>
She
has
very
much
your
complexion
,
 
light
curly
hair
.
<EOS>
She
comes
of
a
good
Mudport
family
,
and
it
's
not
every
offer
that
would
have
been
acceptable
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
But
Stelling
's
not
an
every
-
day
man
;
rather
a
particular
fellow
as
to
the
people
he
chooses
to
be
connected
with
.
<EOS>
But
I
_
think
_
<EOS>
he
would
have
no
objection
to
take
your
son
;
I
_
think
_
he
would
not
,
on
my
representation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
he
could
have
_
against
_
the
lad
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
with
a
slight
touch
of
motherly
indignation
;
"
a
nice
fresh
-
skinned
lad
as
anybody
need
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
's
one
thing
I
'm
thinking
on
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
turning
his
head
on
one
side
and
looking
at
Mr.
Riley
,
after
a
long
perusal
of
the
carpet
.
<EOS>
"
Would
n't
a
parson
be
almost
too
high
-
learnt
to
bring
up
a
lad
to
be
a
man
o
'
business
?
<EOS>
My
notion
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
the
parsons
was
as
they
'd
got
a
sort
<EOS>
o
'
learning
as
lay
mostly
out
o
'
sight
.
<EOS>
And
that
is
n't
what
I
want
for
Tom
.
<EOS>
I
want
him
to
know
figures
,
and
write
like
print
,
and
see
into
things
quick
,
and
know
what
folks
mean
,
and
how
to
wrap
things
up
in
words
as
are
n't
actionable
.
<EOS>
It
's
an
uncommon
fine
thing
,
that
is
,
"
concluded
Mr.
Tulliver
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
when
you
can
let
a
man
know
what
you
think
of
him
without
paying
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
Tulliver
,
"
said
Mr.
Riley
,
"
you
're
quite
under
a
mistake
about
the
clergy
;
all
the
best
schoolmasters
are
of
the
clergy
.
<EOS>
The
schoolmasters
who
are
not
clergymen
are
a
very
low
set
of
men
generally
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
that
Jacobs
is
,
at
the
"
cademy
,
"
interposed
Mr.
Tulliver
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
 
men
who
have
failed
in
other
trades
,
most
likely
.
<EOS>
Now
,
a
clergyman
is
a
gentleman
by
profession
and
education
;
and
besides
that
,
he
has
the
knowledge
that
will
ground
a
boy
,
and
prepare
him
for
entering
on
any
career
with
credit
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
some
clergymen
who
are
mere
bookmen
;
but
you
may
depend
upon
it
,
Stelling
is
not
one
of
them
,
 
a
man
that
's
wide
awake
,
let
me
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Drop
him
a
hint
,
and
that
's
enough
.
<EOS>
You
talk
of
figures
,
now
;
you
have
only
to
say
to
Stelling
,
"
I
want
my
son
to
be
a
thorough
arithmetician
,
"
and
you
may
leave
the
rest
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Riley
paused
a
moment
,
while
Mr.
Tulliver
,
some
-
<EOS>
what
reassured
as
to
clerical
tutorship
,
was
inwardly
rehearsing
to
an
imaginary
Mr.
Stelling
the
statement
,
"
I
want
my
son
to
know
"
rethmetic
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
dear
Tulliver
,
"
Mr.
Riley
continued
,
"
<EOS>
when
you
get
a
thoroughly
educated
man
,
like
Stelling
,
he
's
at
no
loss
to
take
up
any
branch
of
instruction
.
<EOS>
When
a
workman
knows
the
use
of
his
tools
,
he
can
make
a
door
as
well
as
a
window

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
that
's
true
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
almost
convinced
now
that
the
clergy
must
be
the
best
of
schoolmasters
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
'll
do
for
you
,

said
Mr.
Riley
,
"
and
I
would
n't
do
it
for
everybody

<EOS>
I
'll
see
Stelling

father
-
in

law
,
or
drop
him
a
line
when
I
get
back
to
Mudport
,
to
say
that
you
wish
to
place
your
boy
with
his
son
-
in

law

I
dare
say
Stelling
will
write

send
you
his
terms

<EOS>
"
But
there
's
no

is
there

said
Mrs.

for
I

Mr.

you

said
Mr.

winking
and
smiling
at
Mr.

,
with
the
natural
pride
of
a
man
who
has
a
buxom
wife
conspicuously
his
inferior
in
intellect

<EOS>

But
it

true
there
's
no

you

hit
it

<EOS>
"
It
might
be
as
well
not
to
defer
the
arrangement
too
long

"
said
Mr.
Riley
,
quietly
,
"
for
Stelling
may
have
propositions
from
other
parties
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
he
would
not
take
more
than
two
or
three
boarders
,
if
so
many
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
you
,
I
think
I
would
enter
on
the
subject
with
Stelling
at
once
:
there
's
no
necessity
for
sending
the
boy
before
Midsummer
,
but
I
would
be
on
the
safe
side
,
and
make
sure
that
nobody
forestalls
you

broke
in
Maggie

who
had
stolen
unperceived
to
her
father
's
elbow
again
,
listening
with
parted
lips
,
while
she
held
her
doll
topsy

turvy
,
and
crushed
its
nose
against
the
wood
of
the

Maggie
came
round
promptly
in

said
,

answered

being
of
opinion
that

should
always
be
spoken

jocosely

<EOS>

That

said
Maggie
,
tossing
her
head
haughtily
,
and
turning
away
,
with
the
tears
springing
in
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
began
to
dislike
Mr.
Riley
;
it
was
evident
<EOS>
he
thought
her
silly
and
of
no
consequence

<EOS>
"
Hush

added
Mrs.

who
had
her
own
alarm
<EOS>
awakened

"
is
it
so
far
off

I
could

wash
him

"
<EOS>
About
fifteen
miles
;
that
's
all

said
Mr.
Riley

You
can
drive
there

back

pleasant
man
 
<EOS>
he
'd
be
glad
to
have
you
stay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
too
far
off
for
the
linen
,
I
doubt
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
The
entrance
of
supper
opportunely
adjourned
this
difficulty
,
and
relieved
Mr.
Riley
from
the
labor
of
suggesting
some
solution
or
compromise
,
 
a
labor
which
he
would
otherwise
doubtless
have
undertaken
;
for
,
as
you
perceive
,
he
was
a
man
of
very
obliging
manners
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
really
given
himself
the
trouble
of
recommending
Mr.
Stelling
to
his
friend
Tulliver
without
any
positive
expectation
of
a
solid
,
definite
advantage
resulting
to
himself
,
notwithstanding
the
subtle
indications
to
the
contrary
which
might
have
misled
a
too
-
sagacious
observer
.
<EOS>
For
there
is
nothing
more
widely
misleading
than
sagacity
if
it
happens
to
get
on
a
wrong
scent
;
and
sagacity
,
persuaded
that
men
usually
act
and
speak
from
distinct
motives
,
with
a
consciously
proposed
end
in
view
,
is
certain
to
waste
its
energies
on
imaginary
game
.
  
<EOS>
Plotting
covetousness
and
deliberate
contrivance
,
in
order
to
compass
a
selfish
end
,
are
nowhere
abundant
but
in
the
world
of
the
dramatist
:
they
demand
too
intense
a
mental
action
for
many
of
our
fellow
-
parishioners
to
be
guilty
of
them
.
<EOS>
It
is
easy
enough
to
spoil
the
lives
of
our
neighbors
without
taking
so
much
trouble
;
we
can
do
it
by
lazy
acquiescence
and
lazy
omission
,
by
trivial
falsities
for
which
we
hardly
know
a
reason
,
by
small
frauds
neutralized
by
small
extravagances
,
by
maladroit
flatteries
,
and
clumsily
improvised
insinuations
.
<EOS>
We
live
from
hand
to
mouth
,
most
of
us
,
with
a
small
family
of
immediate
desires
;
we
do
little
else
than
snatch
a
morsel
to
satisfy
the
hungry
brood
,
rarely
thinking
of
seed
-
corn
or
the
next
year
's
crop
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Riley
was
a
man
of
business
,
and
not
cold
toward
his
own
interest
,
yet
even
he
was
more
under
the
influence
of
small
promptings
than
of
far
-
sighted
designs
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
private
understanding
with
the
Rev.
Walter
Stelling
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
knew
very
little
of
that
M.A.
and
his
acquirements
,
 
not
quite
enough
,
perhaps
,
to
warrant
so
strong
a
recommendation
of
him
as
he
had
given
to
his
friend
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
But
he
believed
Mr.
Stelling
to
be
an
excellent
classic
,
for
Gadsby
had
said
so
,
and
Gadsby
's
first
cousin
was
an
Oxford
tutor
;
which
was
better
ground
for
the
belief
even
than
his
own
immediate
observation
would
have
been
,
for
though
Mr.
Riley
had
received
a
tincture
of
the
classics
at
the
great
Mudport
Free
School
,
and
had
a
sense
of
understanding
Latin
generally
,
his
comprehension
of
any
particular
Latin
was
not
ready
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
there
remained
a
subtle
aroma
from
his
juvenile
contact
with
the
"
De
Senectute
"
and
the
fourth
book
of
the
"
Æneid
,
"
but
it
had
ceased
to
be
distinctly
recognizable
as
classical
,
and
was
only
perceived
in
the
higher
finish
and
force
of
his
auctioneering
style
.
<EOS>
Then
,
Stelling
was
an
Oxford
man
,
and
the
Oxford
men
were
always
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
it
was
the
Cambridge
men
who
were
always
good
mathematicians
.
<EOS>
But
a
man
who
had
had
a
university
education
could
teach
anything
he
liked
;
especially
a
man
like
Stelling
,
who
had
made
a
speech
at
a
Mudport
dinner
on
a
political
occasion
,
and
had
acquitted
himself
so
well
that
it
was
generally
remarked
,
this
son
-
in
-
law
of
Timpson
's
was
a
sharp
fellow
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
be
expected
of
a
Mudport
man
,
from
the
parish
of
St.
Ursula
,
that
he
would
not
omit
to
do
a
good
turn
to
a
son
-
in
-
law
of
Timpson
's
,
for
Timpson
was
one
of
the
most
useful
and
influential
men
in
the
parish
,
and
had
a
good
deal
of
business
,
which
he
knew
how
to
put
into
the
right
hands
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Riley
liked
such
men
,
quite
apart
from
any
money
which
might
be
diverted
,
through
their
good
judgment
,
from
less
worthy
pockets
into
his
own
;
and
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
him
to
say
to
Timpson
on
his
return
home
,
"
I
've
secured
a
good
pupil
for
your
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"
Timpson
had
a
large
family
of
daughters
;
Mr.
Riley
felt
for
him
;
besides
,
Louisa
Timpson
's
face
,
with
its
light
curls
,
had
been
a
familiar
object
to
him
over
the
pew
wainscot
on
a
Sunday
for
nearly
fifteen
years
;
it
was
natural
her
husband
should
be
a
commendable
tutor
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
Mr.
Riley
knew
of
no
other
schoolmaster
whom
he
had
any
ground
for
recommending
in
preference
;
why
,
then
,
should
he
not
recommend
Stelling
?
<EOS>
His
friend
Tulliver
had
asked
him
for
an
opinion
;
it
is
always
chilling
,
in
friendly
intercourse
,
to
say
you
have
no
opinion
to
give
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
deliver
an
opinion
at
all
,
it
is
mere
stupidity
not
to
do
it
with
an
air
of
conviction
and
well
-
founded
knowledge
.
<EOS>
You
make
it
your
own
in
uttering
it
,
and
naturally
get
fond
of
it
.
<EOS>
Thus
Mr.
Riley
,
knowing
no
harm
of
Stelling
to
begin
with
,
and
wishing
him
well
,
so
far
as
he
had
any
wishes
at
all
concerning
him
,
had
no
sooner
recommended
him
than
he
began
to
think
with
admiration
of
a
man
recommended
on
such
high
authority
,
and
would
soon
have
gathered
so
warm
an
interest
on
the
subject
,
that
if
Mr.
Tulliver
had
in
the
end
declined
to
send
Tom
to
Stelling
,
Mr.
Riley
would
have
thought
his
"
friend
of
the
old
school
"
a
thoroughly
pig
-
headed
fellow
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
blame
Mr.
Riley
very
severely
for
giving
a
recommendation
on
such
slight
grounds
,
I
must
say
you
are
rather
hard
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Why
should
an
auctioneer
and
appraiser
thirty
years
ago
,
who
had
as
good
as
forgotten
his
free
-
school
Latin
,
be
expected
to
manifest
a
delicate
scrupulosity
which
is
not
always
exhibited
by
gentlemen
of
the
learned
professions
,
even
in
our
present
advanced
stage
of
morality
?
  
<EOS>
Besides
,
a
man
with
the
milk
of
human
kindness
in
him
can
scarcely
abstain
from
doing
a
good
-
natured
action
,
and
one
can
not
be
good
-
natured
all
round
.
<EOS>
Nature
herself
occasionally
quarters
an
inconvenient
parasite
on
an
animal
toward
whom
she
has
otherwise
no
ill
will
.
<EOS>
What
then
?
<EOS>
We
admire
her
care
for
the
parasite
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Riley
had
shrunk
from
giving
a
recommendation
that
was
not
based
on
valid
evidence
,
he
would
not
have
helped
Mr.
Stelling
to
a
paying
pupil
,
and
that
would
not
have
been
so
well
for
the
reverend
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Consider
,
too
,
that
all
the
pleasant
little
dim
ideas
and
complacencies
 
of
standing
well
with
Timpson
,
of
dispensing
advice
when
he
was
asked
for
it
,
of
impressing
his
friend
Tulliver
with
additional
respect
,
of
saying
something
,
and
saying
it
emphatically
,
with
other
inappreciably
minute
ingredients
that
went
along
with
the
warm
hearth
and
the
brandy
-
and
-
water
to
make
up
Mr.
Riley
's
consciousness
on
this
occasion
 
would
have
been
a
mere
blank
.
    
<EOS>
Tom
Is
Expected
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
heavy
disappointment
to
Maggie
that
she
was
not
allowed
to
go
with
her
father
in
the
gig
when
he
went
to
fetch
Tom
home
from
the
academy
;
but
the
morning
was
too
wet
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
said
,
for
a
little
girl
to
go
out
in
her
best
bonnet
.
<EOS>
Maggie
took
the
opposite
view
very
strongly
,
and
it
was
a
direct
consequence
of
this
difference
of
opinion
<EOS>
that
when
her
mother
was
in
the
act
of
brushing
out
the
reluctant
black
crop
Maggie
suddenly
rushed
from
under
her
hands
and
dipped
her
head
in
a
basin
of
water
standing
near
,
in
the
vindictive
determination
that
there
should
be
no
more
chance
of
curls
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
Maggie
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
sitting
stout
and
helpless
with
the
brushes
on
her
lap
,
"
what
is
to
become
of
you
if
you
're
so
naughty
?
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
your
aunt
Glegg
and
your
aunt
Pullet
when
they
come
next
week
,
and
they
'll
never
love
you
any
more
.
<EOS>
Oh
dear
,
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
<EOS>
look
at
your
clean
pinafore
,
wet
from
top
to
bottom
.
<EOS>
Folks
"
ull
think
it
's
a
judgment
on
me
as
I
've
got
such
a
child
,
 
they
'll
think
I
've
done
summat
wicked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Before
this
remonstrance
was
finished
,
Maggie
was
already
out
of
hearing
,
making
her
way
toward
the
great
attic
that
run
under
the
old
high
-
pitched
roof
,
shaking
the
water
from
her
black
locks
as
she
ran
,
like
a
Skye
terrier
escaped
from
his
bath
.
<EOS>
This
attic
was
Maggie
's
favorite
retreat
on
a
wet
day
,
when
the
weather
was
not
too
cold
;
here
she
fretted
out
all
her
ill
humors
,
and
talked
aloud
to
the
worm
-
eaten
floors
and
the
worm
-
eaten
shelves
,
and
the
dark
rafters
festooned
with
cobwebs
;
and
here
she
kept
a
Fetish
which
she
punished
for
all
her
misfortunes
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
trunk
of
a
large
wooden
doll
,
which
once
stared
with
the
roundest
of
eyes
above
the
reddest
of
cheeks
;
but
was
now
entirely
defaced
by
a
long
career
of
vicarious
suffering
.
<EOS>
Three
nails
driven
into
the
head
commemorated
as
many
crises
in
Maggie
's
nine
years
of
earthly
struggle
;
that
luxury
of
vengeance
having
been
suggested
to
her
by
the
picture
of
Jael
destroying
Sisera
in
the
old
Bible
.
<EOS>
The
last
nail
had
been
driven
in
with
a
fiercer
stroke
than
usual
,
for
the
Fetish
on
that
occasion
represented
aunt
Glegg
.
<EOS>
But
immediately
afterward
Maggie
had
reflected
that
if
she
drove
many
nails
in
she
would
not
be
so
well
able
to
fancy
that
the
head
was
hurt
when
she
knocked
it
against
the
wall
,
nor
to
comfort
it
,
and
make
believe
to
poultice
it
,
when
her
fury
was
abated
;
for
even
aunt
Glegg
would
be
pitiable
when
she
had
been
hurt
very
much
,
and
thoroughly
humiliated
,
so
as
to
beg
her
niece
's
pardon
.
<EOS>
Since
then
she
had
driven
no
more
nails
in
,
but
had
soothed
herself
by
alternately
grinding
and
beating
the
wooden
head
against
the
rough
brick
of
the
great
chimneys
that
made
two
square
pillars
supporting
the
roof
.
<EOS>
That
was
what
she
did
this
morning
on
reaching
the
attic
,
sobbing
all
the
while
with
a
passion
that
expelled
every
other
form
of
consciousness
,
 
even
the
memory
of
the
grievance
that
had
caused
it
.
<EOS>
As
at
last
the
sobs
were
getting
quieter
,
and
the
grinding
less
fierce
,
a
sudden
beam
of
sunshine
,
falling
through
the
wire
lattice
across
the
worm
-
eaten
shelves
,
made
her
throw
away
the
Fetish
and
run
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
The
sun
was
really
breaking
out
;
the
sound
of
the
mill
seemed
cheerful
again
;
the
granary
doors
were
open
;
and
there
was
Yap
,
the
queer
white
-
and
-
brown
terrier
,
with
one
ear
turned
back
,
trotting
about
and
sniffing
vaguely
,
as
if
he
were
in
search
of
a
companion
.
<EOS>
It
was
irresistible
.
<EOS>
Maggie
tossed
her
hair
back
and
ran
downstairs
,
seized
her
bonnet
without
putting
it
on
,
peeped
,
and
then
dashed
along
the
passage
lest
she
should
encounter
her
mother
,
and
was
quickly
out
in
the
yard
,
whirling
round
like
a
Pythoness
,
and
singing
as
she
whirled
,
"
Yap
,
Yap
,
Tom
's
coming
home
!
"
<EOS>
while
Yap
danced
and
barked
round
her
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
if
there
was
any
noise
wanted
he
was
the
dog
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hegh
,
hegh
,
Miss
!
<EOS>
you
'll
make
yourself
giddy
,
an
'
tumble
down
i
'
the
dirt
,
"
said
Luke
,
the
head
miller
,
a
tall
,
broad
-
shouldered
man
of
forty
,
black
-
eyed
and
black
-
haired
,
subdued
by
a
general
mealiness
,
like
an
auricula
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
paused
in
her
whirling
and
said
,
staggering
a
little
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
,
it
does
n't
make
me
giddy
,
Luke
;
may
I
go
into
the
mill
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
loved
to
linger
in
the
great
spaces
of
the
mill
,
and
often
came
out
with
her
black
hair
powdered
to
a
soft
whiteness
that
made
her
dark
eyes
flash
out
with
new
fire
.
<EOS>
The
resolute
din
,
the
unresting
motion
of
the
great
stones
,
giving
her
a
dim
,
delicious
awe
as
at
the
presence
of
an
uncontrollable
force
;
the
meal
forever
pouring
,
pouring
;
the
fine
white
powder
softening
all
surfaces
,
and
making
the
very
spidernets
look
like
a
faery
lace
-
work
;
the
sweet
,
pure
scent
of
the
meal
,
 
all
helped
to
make
Maggie
feel
that
the
mill
was
a
little
world
apart
from
her
outside
every
-
day
life
.
<EOS>
The
spiders
were
especially
a
subject
of
speculation
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
wondered
if
they
had
any
relatives
outside
the
mill
,
for
in
that
case
there
must
be
a
painful
difficulty
in
their
family
intercourse
,
 
a
fat
and
floury
spider
,
accustomed
to
take
his
fly
well
dusted
with
meal
,
must
suffer
a
little
at
a
cousin
's
table
where
the
fly
was
<EOS>
_
au
naturel
_
,
and
<EOS>
the
lady
spiders
must
be
mutually
shocked
at
each
other
's
appearance
.
<EOS>
But
the
part
of
the
mill
she
liked
best
was
the
topmost
story
,
 
the
corn
-
hutch
,
where
there
were
the
great
heaps
of
grain
,
which
she
could
sit
on
and
slide
down
continually
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
this
recreation
as
she
conversed
with
Luke
,
to
whom
she
was
very
communicative
,
wishing
him
to
think
well
of
her
understanding
,
as
her
father
did
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
felt
it
necessary
to
recover
her
position
with
him
on
the
present
occasion
for
,
as
she
sat
sliding
on
the
heap
of
grain
near
which
he
was
busying
himself
,
she
said
,
at
that
shrill
pitch
which
was
requisite
in
mill
-
society
,
    
"
I
think
you
never
read
any
book
but
the
Bible
<EOS>
,
did
you
,

<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Miss
,
an
'
not
much
o
'
that
,
"
said
Luke
,
with
great
frankness
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
no
reader
,
I
are
n't
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
I
lent
you
one
of
my
books
,
Luke
?
<EOS>
I
've
not
got
any
_
very
_
pretty
books
that
would
be
easy
for
you
to
read
;
but
there
's
"
Pug
's
Tour
of
Europe
,
"
 
that
would
tell
you
all
about
the
different
sorts
of
people
in
the
world
,
and
if
you
did
n't
understand
the
reading
,
the
pictures
would
help
you
;
they
show
the
looks
and
ways
of
the
people
,
and
what
they
do
.
<EOS>
There
are
the
Dutchmen
,
very
fat
,
and
smoking
,
you
know
,
and
one
sitting
on
a
barrel
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
Miss
,
I'n
<EOS>
no
opinion
o
'
Dutchmen

<EOS>
There
ben't
much
good
<EOS>
i
'
knowin
'
about

them

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
they
're
our
fellow
-
creatures
,
Luke
;
we
ought
to
know
about
our
fellow
-
creatures
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
much
o
'
fellow
-
creaturs
,
I
think
,
Miss
;
all
I
know
 
my
old
master
,
as
war
a
knowin
'
man
,
used
to
say
,
says
he
,
"
If
e'er
I
sow
my
wheat
wi'out
brinin
'
,
I
'm
a
Dutchman
,
"
says
he
;
an
'
that
war
as
much
as
to
say
as
a
Dutchman
war
a
fool
,
or
next
door
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
nay
,
I
are
n't
goin'
to
bother
mysen
about

There

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
well
,
"
said
Maggie
,
rather
foiled
by
Luke
's
unexpectedly
decided
views
about
Dutchmen
,
"
<EOS>
perhaps
you
would
like
"
Animated
Nature
"
better
;
that
's
not
Dutchmen
,
you
know
,
but
elephants
and
kangaroos
,
and
the
civet
-
cat
,
and
the
sunfish
,
and
a
bird
sitting
on
its
tail
,
 
I
forget
its
name
.
<EOS>
There
are
countries
full
of
those
creatures
,
instead
of
horses
and
cows
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Should
n't
you
like
to
know
about
them
,
Luke
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Miss
,
I'n
got
to
keep
count
o
'
<EOS>
the
flour
an
'
corn
<EOS>
;
I
ca
n't
do
wi
'
knowin
'
so
many
things
besides
my
work
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
brings
folks
to
the
gallows
,
 
<EOS>
knowin
'
everything
but
what
they'n
got
to
get
their
bread
by
.
<EOS>
An
'
<EOS>
they
're
mostly
lies
,
I
think
,
what
's
printed
<EOS>
i
'
the
books
<EOS>
:
them
printed
sheets
are
,
anyhow
,
as
the
men
cry
i
'
the
streets
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
're
like
my
brother
Tom
,
Luke
,
"
said
Maggie
,
wishing
to
turn
the
conversation
agreeably
;
"
Tom
's
not
fond
of
reading
.
<EOS>
I
love
Tom
so
dearly
,
Luke
,
 
better
than
anybody
else
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
When
he
grows
up
<EOS>
I
shall
keep
his
house
,
and
we
shall
always
live
together
.
<EOS>
I
can
tell
him
everything
he
does
n't
know
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
Tom
's
clever
,
for
all
he
does
n't
like
books
;
he
makes
beautiful
whipcord
and
rabbit
-
pens
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Luke
,
"
but
he
'll
be
fine
an
'
vexed
,
as
the
rabbits
are
all
dead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dead
!
"
<EOS>
screamed
Maggie
,
jumping
up
from
her
sliding
seat
on
the
corn
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
,
Luke
!
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
the
lop
-
eared
one
,
and
the
spotted
doe
that
Tom
spent
all
his
money
to
buy
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
As
dead
as
moles
,
"
said
Luke
,
fetching
his
comparison
from
the
unmistakable
corpses
nailed
to
the
stable
wall
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
Luke
,
"
said
Maggie
,
in
a
piteous
tone
,
while
the
big
tears
rolled
down
her
cheek
;
"
Tom
told
me
to
take
care
of
'em
,
and
I
forgot
.
<EOS>
What
_
<EOS>
shall
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
see
,
Miss
,
they
were
in
that
far
tool
-
house
,
an
'
<EOS>
it
was
nobody
's
business
to
see
to
'em
.
<EOS>
I
reckon
Master
Tom
told
Harry
to
feed
'em
,
but
there
's
no
countin

on
Harry
;
_
<EOS>
he
's
_
an
offal
creatur

iver
come
about
the

he
is

He
remembers
nothing

his

inside

an
<EOS>
'
I
wish
it

ud
gripe
him

"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Luke
,
Tom
told
me
to
be
sure
and
remember
the
rabbits
every
day
;
but
how
could
I
,
when
they
did
n't
come
into
my
head
,
you
know
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
he
will
be
so
angry
with
me
,
<EOS>
I
know
he
will
,
and
so
sorry
about
his
rabbits
,
and
so
am
I
sorry
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
_
<EOS>
shall
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
you
fret
,
Miss
<EOS>
,
"
said
Luke
,
soothingly
;
"
they
're
nash
things
,
them
lop
-
eared
rabbits
;
they
'd
happen
ha
'
died
,
if

'd
been

<EOS>
Things
out
o
<EOS>
'
natur
niver

:
God
A'mighty
does
n't
like
'em
.
<EOS>
He
made
the
rabbits
'
ears
to
lie
back
,
an
'
it
's
nothin'
but
contrairiness
to
make
'em
hing
down
like
a
mastiff
dog
's
.
<EOS>
Master
Tom
"
ull
know
better
nor
buy
such
things
another

<EOS>
Do
n't
you
fret
,
Miss.
<EOS>
Will
you
come
along
home
wi
'
me
,
and
see
my
wife
?
<EOS>
I
'm
a

goin

this
minute
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
invitation
offered
an
agreeable
distraction
to
Maggie
's
grief
,
and
her
tears
gradually
subsided
as
she
trotted
along
by
Luke
's
side
to
his
pleasant
cottage
,
which
stood
with
its
apple
and
pear
trees
,
and
with
the
added
dignity
of
a
lean
-
to
pigsty
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
Mill
fields
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Moggs
,
Luke
's
wife
,
was
a
decidedly
agreeable
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
She
exhibited
her
hospitality
in
bread
and
treacle
,
and
possessed
various
works
of
art
.
<EOS>
Maggie
actually
forgot
that
she
had
any
special
cause
of
sadness
this
morning
,
as
she
stood
on
a
chair
to
look
at
a
remarkable
series
of
pictures
representing
the
Prodigal
Son
in
the
costume
of
Sir
Charles
Grandison
,
except
that
,
as
might
have
been
expected
from
his
defective
moral
character
,
he
had
not
,
like
that
accomplished
hero
,
the
taste
and
strength
of
mind
to
dispense
with
a
wig
.
<EOS>
But
the
indefinable
weight
the
dead
rabbits
had
left
on
her
mind
caused
her
to
feel
more
than
usual
pity
for
the
career
of
this
weak
young
man
,
particularly
when
she
looked
at
the
picture
where
he
leaned
against
a
tree
with
a
flaccid
appearance
,
his
knee
-
breeches
unbuttoned
and
<EOS>
his
wig
awry
,
while
the
swine
apparently
of
some
foreign
breed
,
seemed
to
insult
him
by
their
good
spirits
over
their
feast
of
husks
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
glad
his
father
took
him
back
again
,
are
n't
you
,
Luke
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
For
he
was
very
sorry
,
you
know
,
and
would
n't
do
wrong
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
Miss
,
"
said
Luke
,
"
he
'd
be
no
great
shakes
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
,
let
's
feyther
do
what
he
would
for
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
That
was
a
painful
thought
to
Maggie
,
and
she
wished
much
that
the
subsequent
history
of
the
young
man
had
not
been
left
a
blank
.
    
<EOS>
Tom
Comes
Home
  
<EOS>
Tom
was
to
arrive
early
in
the
afternoon
,
and
there
was
another
fluttering
heart
besides
Maggie
's
when
it
was
late
enough
for
the
sound
of
the
gig
-
wheels
to
be
expected
;
for
if
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
a
strong
feeling
,
it
was
fondness
for
her
boy
.
<EOS>
At
last
the
sound
came
,
 
that
quick
light
bowling
of
the
gig
-
wheels
,
 
and
in
spite
of
the
wind
,
which
was
blowing
the
clouds
about
,
and
was
not
likely
to
respect
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
curls
and
cap
-
strings
<EOS>
,
she
came
outside
the
door
,
and
even
held
her
hand
on
Maggie
's
offending
head
,
forgetting
all
the
griefs
of
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
he
is
,
my
sweet
lad
!
<EOS>
But
,
Lord
ha
'
mercy
!
<EOS>
he
's
got
never
a
collar
on
;
it
's
been
lost
on
the
road
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
and
spoilt
the
set
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
stood
with
her
arms
open
;
Maggie
jumped
first
on
one
leg
and
then
on
the
other
;
while
Tom
descended
from
the
gig
,
and
said
,
with
masculine
reticence
as
to
the
tender
emotions
,
"
Hallo
!
<EOS>
Yap
 
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
are
you
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
he
submitted
to
be
kissed
willingly
enough
,
though
Maggie
hung
on
his
neck
in
rather
a
strangling
fashion
,
while
his
blue
-
gray
eyes
wandered
toward
the
croft
and
the
lambs
and
the
river
,
where
he
promised
himself
that
he
would
begin
to
fish
the
first
thing
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
He
was
one
of
those
lads
that
grow
everywhere
in
England
,
and
at
twelve
or
thirteen
years
of
age
look
as
much
alike
as
goslings
,
 
a
lad
with
light
-
brown
hair
,
cheeks
of
cream
and
roses
,
full
lips
,
indeterminate
nose
and
eyebrows
,
 
a
physiognomy
in
which
it
seems
impossible
to
discern
anything
but
the
generic
character
to
boyhood
;
as
different
as
possible
from
poor
Maggie
's
phiz
,
which
Nature
seemed
to
have
moulded
and
colored
with
the
most
decided
intention
.
<EOS>
But
that
same
Nature
has
the
deep
cunning
which
hides
itself
under
the
appearance
of
openness
,
so
that
simple
people
think
they
can
see
through
her
quite
well
,
and
all
the
while
she
is
secretly
preparing
a
refutation
of
their
confident
prophecies
.
<EOS>
Under
these
average
boyish
physiognomies
that
she
seems
to
turn
off
by
the
gross
,
she
conceals
some
of
her
most
rigid
,
inflexible
purposes
,
some
of
her
most
unmodifiable
characters
;
and
the
dark
-
eyed
,
demonstrative
,
rebellious
girl
may
after
all
turn
out
to
be
a
passive
being
compared
with
this
pink
-
and
-
white
bit
of
masculinity
with
the
indeterminate
features
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
"
said
Tom
,
confidentially
,
taking
her
into
a
corner
,
as
soon
as
his
mother
was
gone
out
to
examine
his
box
and
the
warm
parlor
had
taken
off
the
chill
he
had
felt
from
the
long
drive
,
"
you
do
n't
know
what
I
've
got
in
_
<EOS>
my
_
pockets
,
"
nodding
his
head
up
and
down
as
a
means
of
rousing
her
sense
of
mystery
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
How
stodgy
they
look
,
Tom
!
<EOS>
Is
it
marls
(
marbles
)
or
cobnuts
?
"
<EOS>
Maggie
's
heart
sank
a
little
,
because
Tom
always
said
it
was
"
no
good
"
playing
with
_
her
_
at
those
games
,
she
played
so
badly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Marls
!
<EOS>
no
;
I
've
swopped
all
my
marls
with
the
little
fellows
,
and
cobnuts
are
no
fun
,
you
silly
,
only
when
the
nuts
are
green
.
<EOS>
But
see
here
!
"
<EOS>
He
drew
something
half
out
of
his
right
-
hand
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
said
Maggie
,
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
see
nothing
but
a
bit
of
yellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
's
 
a
 
new
 
guess
,
Maggie
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
_
ca
n't
_
guess
,
Tom
,
"
said
Maggie
,
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
a
spitfire
,
else
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
tell
you
,
"
said
Tom
,
thrusting
his
hand
back
into
his
pocket
and
looking
determined
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Tom
,
"
said
Maggie
,
imploringly
,
laying
hold
of
the
arm
that
was
held
stiffly
in
the
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
cross
,
Tom
;
it
was
only
because
I
ca
n't
bear
guessing
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Please
_
be
good
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
's
arm
slowly
relaxed
,
and
he
said
,
"
Well
,
then
,
it
's
a
new
fish
-
line
 
two
new
uns
,
 
one
for
you
,
Maggie
,
all
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
go
halves
in
the
toffee
and
gingerbread
on
purpose
to
save
the
money
;
and
Gibson
and
Spouncer
fought
with
me
because
I
would
n't
.
<EOS>
And
here
's
hooks
<EOS>
;
see
here
 
I
say
,
_
wo
n't
_
<EOS>
we
go
and
fish
to
-
morrow
down
by
the
Round
Pool
?
<EOS>
And
you
shall
catch
your
own
fish
,
Maggie
and
put
the
worms
on
,
and
everything
;
wo
n't
it
be
fun
?
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
answer
was
to
throw
her
arms
<EOS>
round
Tom
's
neck
and
hug
him
,
and
hold
her
cheek
against
his
without
speaking
,
while
he
slowly
unwound
some
of
the
line
,
saying
,
after
a
pause
,
    
"
Was
n't
I
a
good
brother
,
now
,
to
buy
you
a
line
all
to
yourself
?
<EOS>
You
know
,
I
need
n't
have
bought
it
,
if
I
had
n't
liked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
very
,
very
good
 
<EOS>
I
_
do
_
love
you
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
had
put
the
line
back
in
his
pocket
,
and
was
looking
at
the
hooks
one
by
one
,
before
he
spoke
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
the
fellows
fought
me
,
because
I
would
n't
give
in
about
the
toffee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
I
wish
they
would
n't
fight
at
your
school
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
Did
n't
it
hurt
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hurt
me
?
<EOS>
no
,
"
said
Tom
,
putting
up
the
hooks
again
,
taking
out
a
large
pocket
-
knife
,
and
slowly
opening
the
largest
blade
,
which
he
looked
at
meditatively
as
he
rubbed
his
finger
along
it
.
<EOS>
Then
he
added
,
    
"
I
gave
Spouncer
a
black
eye
,
I
know
;
that
's
what
he
got
by
wanting
to
leather
_
me
;
_
<EOS>
I
was
n't
going
to
go
halves
because
anybody
leathered
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
how
brave
you
are
,
Tom
!
<EOS>
I
think
you
're
like
Samson
.
<EOS>
If
there
came
a
lion
roaring
at
me
,
I
think
you
'd
fight
him
,
would
n't
you
,
Tom
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
a
lion
come
roaring
at
you
,
you
silly
thing
?
<EOS>
There
's
no
lions
,
only
in
the
shows
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
but
if
we
were
in
the
lion
countries
 
<EOS>
I
mean
in
Africa
,
where
it
's
very
hot
;
the
lions
eat
people
there
.
<EOS>
I
can
show
it
you
in
the
book
where
I
read
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
should
get
a
gun
and
shoot
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
had
n't
got
a
gun
,
 
we
might
have
gone
out
,
you
know
,
not
thinking
,
just
as
we
go
fishing
;
and
then
a
great
lion
might
run
toward
us
roaring
,
and
we
could
n't
get
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
What
should
you
do
,
Tom
?
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
paused
,
and
at
last
turned
away
contemptuously
,
saying
,
"
<EOS>
But
the
lion
_
is
n't
_
coming
.
<EOS>
What
's
the
use
of
talking
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
like
to
fancy
how
it
would
be
,
"
said
Maggie
,
following
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
think
what
you
would
do
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
bother
,
Maggie
!
<EOS>
you
're
such
a
silly
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
and
see
my
rabbits
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
heart
began
to
flutter
with
fear
.
<EOS>
She
dared
not
tell
the
sad
truth
at
once
,
but
she
walked
after
Tom
in
trembling
silence
as
he
went
out
,
thinking
how
she
could
tell
him
the
news
so
as
to
soften
at
once
his
sorrow
and
his
anger
;
for
Maggie
dreaded
Tom
's
anger
of
all
things
;
it
was
quite
a
different
anger
from
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
"
she
said
,
timidly
,
when
they
were
out
of
doors
,
"
how
much
money
did
you
give
for
your
rabbits
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Two
half
-
crowns
and
a
sixpence
,
"
said
Tom
,
promptly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
've
got
a
great
deal
more
than
that
in
my
steel
purse
upstairs
.
<EOS>
I
'll
ask
mother
to
give
it
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
for
?
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
_
<EOS>
your
_
money
,
you
silly
thing
.
<EOS>
I
've
got
a
great
deal
more
money
than
you
,
because
I
'm
a
boy
.
<EOS>
I
always
have
half
-
sovereigns
and
sovereigns
for
my
Christmas
boxes
because
I
shall
be
a
man
,
and
you
only
have
five
-
shilling
pieces
,
because
you
're
only
a
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
Tom
 
if
mother
would
let
me
give
you
two
half
-
crowns
and
a
sixpence
out
of
my
purse
to
put
into
your
pocket
and
spend
,
you
know
,
and
buy
some
more
rabbits
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
More
rabbits
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
,
Tom
,
they
're
all
dead
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
stopped
immediately
in
his
walk
and
turned
round
toward
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
You
forgot
to
feed
'em
,
then
,
and
Harry
forgot
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
,
his
color
heightening
for
a
moment
,
but
soon
subsiding
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
pitch
into
Harry
.
<EOS>
I
'll
have
him
turned
away
.
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
love
you
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
You
sha'n"t
go
fishing
with
me
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
to
go
and
see
the
rabbits
every
day
.
"
<EOS>
He
walked
on
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
I
forgot
 
<EOS>
and
I
could
n't
help
it
,
indeed
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
I
'm
so
very
sorry
,
"
said
Maggie
,
while
the
tears
rushed
fast
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
naughty
girl
,
"
said
Tom
,
severely
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
I
bought
you
the
fish
-
line
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
love
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Tom
,
it
's
very
cruel
,
"
sobbed
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
forgive
you
,
if
_
<EOS>
you
_
forgot
anything
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
mind
what
you
did
 
<EOS>
I
'd
forgive
you
and
love
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
're
silly
;
but
I
never
_
do
<EOS>
_
forget
things
,
<EOS>
_
I
_
do
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
please
forgive
me
,
Tom
;
my
heart
will
break
,
"
said
Maggie
,
shaking
with
sobs
,
clinging
to
Tom
's
arm
,
and
laying
her
wet
cheek
on
his
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
shook
her
off
,
and
stopped
again
,
saying
in
a
peremptory
tone
,
"
Now
,
Maggie
,
you
just
listen
.
<EOS>
Are
n't
I
a
good
brother
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ye
-
ye
-
es
,
"
sobbed
Maggie
,
her
chin
rising
and
falling
convulsedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
I
think
about
your
fish
-
line
all
this
quarter
,
and
mean
to
buy
it
,
and
saved
my
money
o
'
purpose
,
and
would
n't
go
halves
in
the
toffee
,
and
Spouncer
fought
me
because
I
would
n't
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ye
-
ye
-
es
 
<EOS>
and
I
 
<EOS>
lo
-
lo
-
love
you
<EOS>
so
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
're
a
naughty
girl
.
<EOS>
Last
holidays
you
licked
the
paint
off
my
lozenge
-
box
,
and
the
holidays
before
that
you
let
the
boat
drag
my
fish
-
line
down
when
I
'd
set
you
to
watch
it
,
and
you
pushed
your
head
through
my
kite
,
all
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
did
n't
mean
,
"
said
Maggie
;
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
help
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
could
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
if
you
'd
minded
what
you
were
doing
.
<EOS>
And
you
're
a
naughty
girl
,
and
you
sha'n"t
go
fishing
with
me
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
terrible
conclusion
,
Tom
ran
away
from
Maggie
toward
the
mill
,
meaning
to
greet
Luke
there
,
and
complain
to
him
of
Harry
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
stood
motionless
,
except
from
her
sobs
,
for
a
minute
or
two
;
then
she
turned
round
and
ran
into
the
house
,
and
up
to
her
attic
,
where
she
sat
on
the
floor
and
laid
her
head
against
the
worm
-
eaten
shelf
,
with
a
crushing
sense
of
misery
.
<EOS>
Tom
was
come
home
,
and
she
had
thought
how
happy
she
should
be
;
and
now
he
was
cruel
to
her
.
<EOS>
What
use
was
anything
if
Tom
did
n't
love
her
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
he
was
very
cruel
!
<EOS>
Had
n't
she
wanted
to
give
him
the
money
,
and
said
how
very
sorry
she
was
?
<EOS>
She
knew
she
was
naughty
to
her
mother
,
but
she
had
never
been
naughty
to
Tom
 
had
never
_
meant
_
to
be
naughty
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
is
cruel
!
"
<EOS>
Maggie
sobbed
aloud
,
finding
a
wretched
pleasure
in
the
hollow
resonance
that
came
through
the
long
empty
space
of
the
attic
.
<EOS>
She
never
thought
of
beating
or
grinding
her
Fetish
;
she
was
too
miserable
to
be
angry
.
  
<EOS>
These
bitter
sorrows
of
childhood
!
<EOS>
when
sorrow
is
all
new
and
strange
,
when
hope
has
not
yet
got
wings
to
fly
beyond
the
days
and
weeks
,
and
the
space
from
summer
to
summer
seems
measureless
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
soon
thought
she
had
been
hours
in
the
attic
,
and
it
must
be
tea
-
time
,
and
they
were
all
having
their
tea
,
and
not
thinking
of
her
.
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
she
would
stay
up
there
and
starve
herself
,
 
hide
herself
behind
the
tub
,
and
stay
there
all
night
,
 
and
then
they
would
all
be
frightened
,
and
Tom
would
be
sorry
.
<EOS>
Thus
Maggie
thought
in
the
pride
of
her
heart
,
as
she
crept
behind
the
tub
;
but
presently
she
began
to
cry
again
at
the
idea
that
they
did
n't
mind
her
being
there
.
<EOS>
If
she
went
down
again
to
Tom
now
 
would
he
forgive
her
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
her
father
would
be
there
,
and
he
would
take
her
part
.
<EOS>
But
then
she
wanted
Tom
to
forgive
her
because
he
loved
her
,
not
because
his
father
told
him
.
<EOS>
No
,
she
would
never
go
down
if
Tom
did
n't
come
to
fetch
her
.
<EOS>
This
resolution
lasted
in
great
intensity
for
five
dark
minutes
behind
the
tub
;
but
then
the
need
of
being
loved
 
the
strongest
need
in
poor
Maggie
's
nature
 
began
to
wrestle
with
her
pride
,
and
soon
threw
it
.
<EOS>
She
crept
from
behind
her
tub
into
the
twilight
of
the
long
attic
,
but
just
then
she
heard
a
quick
foot
-
step
on
the
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
had
been
too
much
interested
in
his
talk
with
Luke
,
in
going
the
round
of
the
premises
,
walking
in
and
out
where
he
pleased
,
and
whittling
sticks
without
any
particular
reason
,
 
except
that
he
did
n't
whittle
sticks
at
school
,
 
to
think
of
Maggie
and
the
effect
his
anger
had
produced
on
her
.
<EOS>
He
meant
to
punish
her
,
and
that
business
having
been
performed
,
he
occupied
himself
with
other
matters
,
like
a
practical
person
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
had
been
called
in
to
tea
,
his
father
said
,
"
Why
,
where
's
the
little
wench
?
"
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
almost
at
the
same
moment
,
said
,
"
Where
's
your
little
sister
?
<EOS>
"
 
both
of
them
having
supposed
that
Maggie
and
Tom
had
been
together
all
the
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
He
did
n't
want
to
"
tell
"
of
Maggie
,
though
he
was
angry
with
her
;
for
Tom
Tulliver
was
a
lad
of
honor
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
has
n't
she
been
playing
with
you
all
this
while
?
"
said
the
father
.
<EOS>
"
She
'd
been
thinking
o
'
nothing
but
your
coming
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
seen
her
this
two
hours
,
"
says
Tom
,
commencing
on
the
plumcake
.
  
<EOS>
"
Goodness
heart
;
she
's
got
drownded
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
rising
from
her
seat
and
running
to
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
could
you
let
her
do
so
?
<EOS>
"
she
added
,
as
became
a
fearful
woman
,
accusing
she
did
n't
know
whom
of
she
did
n't
know
what
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
,
she
's
none
drownded
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
been
naughty
to
her
,
I
doubt
,
Tom
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
have
n't
,
father
,
"
said
Tom
,
indignantly
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
's
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Perhaps
up
in
that
attic
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
"
a
-
singing
and
talking
to
herself
,
and
forgetting
all
about
meal
-
times
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
go
and
fetch
her
down
,
Tom
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
rather
sharply
,
 
his
perspicacity
or
his
fatherly
fondness
for
Maggie
making
him
suspect
that
the
lad
had
been
hard
upon
"
the
little
un
,
"
else
she
would
never
have
left
his
side
.
"
<EOS>
And
be
good
to
her
,
do
you
hear
?
<EOS>
Else
I
'll
let
you
know
better
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
never
disobeyed
his
father
,
for
Mr.
Tulliver
was
a
peremptory
man
,
and
,
as
he
said
,
would
never
let
anybody
get
hold
of
his
whip
-
hand
;
but
he
went
out
rather
sullenly
,
carrying
his
piece
of
plumcake
,
and
not
intending
to
reprieve
Maggie
's
punishment
,
which
was
no
more
than
she
deserved
.
<EOS>
Tom
was
only
thirteen
,
and
had
no
decided
views
in
grammar
and
arithmetic
,
regarding
them
for
the
most
part
as
open
questions
,
but
he
was
particularly
clear
and
positive
on
one
point
,
 
namely
,
that
he
would
punish
everybody
who
deserved
it
.
<EOS>
Why
,
he
would
n't
have
minded
being
punished
himself
if
he
deserved
it
;
but
,
then
,
he
never
_
did
_
deserve
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
Tom
's
step
,
then
,
that
Maggie
heard
on
the
stairs
,
when
her
need
of
love
had
triumphed
over
her
pride
,
and
she
was
going
down
with
her
swollen
eyes
and
dishevelled
hair
to
beg
for
pity
.
<EOS>
At
least
her
father
would
stroke
her
head
and
say
,
"
Never
mind
,
my
wench
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
wonderful
subduer
,
this
need
of
love
,
 
this
hunger
of
the
heart
,
 
as
peremptory
as
that
other
hunger
by
which
Nature
forces
us
to
submit
to
the
yoke
,
and
change
the
face
of
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
knew
Tom
's
step
,
and
her
heart
began
to
beat
violently
with
the
sudden
shock
of
hope
.
<EOS>
He
only
stood
still
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
said
,
"
Maggie
,
you
're
to
come
down
.
"
<EOS>
But
she
rushed
to
him
and
clung
round
his
neck
,
sobbing
,
"
Oh
,
Tom
,
please
forgive
me
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
it
 
<EOS>
I
will
always
be
good
 
<EOS>
always
remember
things
 
<EOS>
do
love
me
 
please
,
dear
Tom
!
"
  
<EOS>
We
learn
to
restrain
ourselves
as
we
get
older
.
<EOS>
We
keep
apart
when
we
have
quarrelled
,
express
ourselves
in
well
-
bred
phrases
,
and
in
this
way
preserve
a
dignified
alienation
,
showing
much
firmness
on
one
side
,
and
swallowing
much
grief
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
We
no
longer
approximate
in
our
behavior
to
the
mere
impulsiveness
of
the
lower
animals
,
but
conduct
ourselves
in
every
respect
like
members
of
a
highly
civilized
society
.
<EOS>
Maggie
and
Tom
were
still
very
much
like
young
animals
,
and
so
she
could
rub
her
cheek
against
his
,
and
kiss
his
ear
in
a
random
sobbing
way
;
and
there
were
tender
fibres
in
the
lad
that
had
been
used
to
answer
to
Maggie
's
fondling
,
so
that
he
behaved
with
a
weakness
quite
inconsistent
with
his
resolution
to
punish
her
as
much
as
she
deserved
.
<EOS>
He
actually
began
to
kiss
her
in
return
,
and
say
,
    
"
Do
n't
cry
,
then
,
Magsie
;
here
,
eat
a
bit
o
'
cake
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
sobs
began
to
subside
,
and
she
put
out
her
mouth
for
the
cake
and
bit
a
piece
;
and
then
Tom
bit
a
piece
,
just
for
company
,
and
they
ate
together
and
rubbed
each
other
's
cheeks
and
brows
and
noses
together
,
while
they
ate
,
with
a
humiliating
resemblance
to
two
friendly
ponies
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
along
,
Magsie
,
and
have
tea
,
"
said
Tom
at
last
,
when
there
was
no
more
cake
except
what
was
down
-
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
So
ended
the
sorrows
of
this
day
,
and
the
next
morning
Maggie
was
trotting
with
her
own
fishing
-
rod
in
one
hand
and
a
handle
of
the
basket
in
the
other
,
stepping
always
,
by
a
peculiar
gift
,
in
the
muddiest
places
,
and
looking
darkly
radiant
from
under
her
beaver
-
bonnet
because
Tom
was
good
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
Tom
,
however
,
that
she
should
like
him
to
put
the
worms
on
the
hook
for
her
,
although
she
accepted
his
word
when
he
assured
her
that
worms
could
n't
feel
(
it
was
Tom
's
private
opinion
that
it
did
n't
much
matter
if
they
did
)
.
<EOS>
He
knew
all
about
worms
,
and
fish
,
and
those
things
;
and
what
birds
were
mischievous
,
and
how
padlocks
opened
,
and
which
way
the
handles
of
the
gates
were
to
be
lifted
.
<EOS>
Maggie
thought
this
sort
of
knowledge
was
very
wonderful
,
 
much
more
difficult
than
remembering
what
was
in
the
books
;
and
she
was
rather
in
awe
of
Tom
's
superiority
,
for
he
was
the
only
person
who
called
her
knowledge
"
stuff
,
"
and
did
not
feel
surprised
at
her
cleverness
.
<EOS>
Tom
,
indeed
,
was
of
opinion
that
Maggie
was
a
silly
little
thing
;
all
girls
were
silly
,
 
they
could
n't
throw
a
stone
so
as
to
hit
anything
,
could
n't
do
anything
with
a
pocket
-
knife
,
and
were
frightened
at
frogs
.
<EOS>
Still
,
he
was
very
fond
of
his
sister
,
and
meant
always
to
take
care
of
her
,
make
her
his
housekeeper
,
and
punish
her
when
she
did
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
on
their
way
to
the
Round
Pool
,
 
that
wonderful
pool
,
which
the
floods
had
made
a
long
while
ago
.
<EOS>
No
one
knew
how
deep
it
was
;
and
it
was
mysterious
,
too
,
that
it
should
be
almost
a
perfect
round
,
framed
in
with
willows
and
tall
reeds
,
so
that
the
water
was
only
to
be
seen
when
you
got
close
to
the
brink
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
the
old
favorite
spot
always
heightened
Tom
's
good
humor
,
and
he
spoke
to
Maggie
in
the
most
amicable
whispers
,
as
he
opened
the
precious
basket
and
prepared
their
tackle
.
<EOS>
He
threw
her
line
for
her
,
and
put
the
rod
into
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Maggie
thought
it
probable
that
the
small
fish
would
come
to
her
hook
,
and
the
large
ones
to
Tom
's
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
forgotten
all
about
the
fish
,
and
was
looking
dreamily
at
the
glassy
water
,
when
Tom
said
,
in
a
loud
whisper
,
"
Look
,
look
,
Maggie
!
"
and
came
running
to
prevent
her
from
snatching
her
line
away
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
was
frightened
lest
she
had
been
doing
something
wrong
,
as
usual
,
but
presently
Tom
drew
out
her
line
and
brought
a
large
tench
bouncing
on
the
grass
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
was
excited
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
Magsie
,
you
little
duck
!
<EOS>
Empty
the
basket
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
was
not
conscious
of
unusual
merit
,
but
it
was
enough
that
Tom
called
her
Magsie
,
and
was
pleased
with
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
to
mar
her
delight
in
the
whispers
and
the
dreamy
silences
,
when
she
listened
to
the
light
dripping
sounds
of
the
rising
fish
,
and
the
gentle
rustling
,
as
if
the
willows
and
the
reeds
and
the
water
had
their
happy
whisperings
also
.
<EOS>
Maggie
thought
it
would
make
a
very
nice
heaven
to
sit
by
the
pool
in
that
way
,
and
never
be
scolded
.
<EOS>
She
never
knew
she
had
a
bite
till
Tom
told
her
;
but
she
liked
fishing
very
much
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
their
happy
mornings
.
<EOS>
They
trotted
along
and
sat
down
together
,
with
no
thought
that
life
would
ever
change
much
for
them
;
they
would
only
get
bigger
and
not
go
to
school
,
and
it
would
always
be
like
the
holidays
;
they
would
always
live
together
and
be
fond
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
And
the
mill
with
its
booming
;
the
great
chestnut
-
tree
under
which
they
played
at
houses
;
their
own
little
river
,
the
Ripple
,
where
the
banks
seemed
like
home
,
and
Tom
was
always
seeing
the
water
-
rats
,
while
Maggie
gathered
the
purple
plumy
tops
of
the
reeds
,
which
she
forgot
and
dropped
afterward
;
above
all
,
the
great
Floss
,
along
which
they
wandered
with
a
sense
of
travel
,
to
see
the
rushing
spring
-
tide
,
the
awful
Eagle
,
come
up
like
a
hungry
monster
,
or
to
see
the
Great
Ash
which
had
once
wailed
and
groaned
like
a
man
,
these
things
would
always
be
just
the
same
to
them
.
<EOS>
Tom
thought
people
were
at
a
disadvantage
who
lived
on
any
other
spot
of
the
globe
;
and
Maggie
,
when
she
read
about
Christiana
passing
"
the
river
over
which
there
is
no
bridge
,
"
always
saw
the
Floss
between
the
green
pastures
by
the
Great
Ash
.
  
<EOS>
Life
did
change
for
Tom
and
Maggie
;
and
yet
they
were
not
wrong
in
believing
that
the
thoughts
and
loves
of
these
first
years
would
always
make
part
of
their
lives
.
<EOS>
We
could
never
have
loved
the
earth
so
well
if
we
had
had
no
childhood
in
it
,
 
if
it
were
not
the
earth
where
the
same
flowers
come
up
again
every
spring
that
we
used
to
gather
with
our
tiny
fingers
as
we
sat
lisping
to
ourselves
on
the
grass
;
the
same
hips
and
haws
on
the
autumn
's
hedgerows
;
the
same
redbreasts
that
we
used
to
call
"
God
's
birds
,
"
because
they
did
no
harm
to
the
precious
crops
.
<EOS>
What
novelty
is
worth
that
sweet
monotony
where
everything
is
known
,
and
_
loved
_
because
it
is
known
?
  
<EOS>
The
wood
I
walk
in
on
this
mild
May
day
,
with
the
young
yellow
-
brown
foliage
of
the
oaks
between
me
and
the
blue
sky
,
the
white
star
-
flowers
and
the
blue
-
eyed
speedwell
and
the
ground
ivy
at
my
feet
,
what
grove
of
tropic
palms
,
what
strange
ferns
or
splendid
broad
-
petalled
blossoms
,
could
ever
thrill
such
deep
and
delicate
fibres
within
me
as
this
home
scene
?
<EOS>
These
familiar
flowers
,
these
well
-
remembered
bird
-
notes
,
this
sky
,
with
its
fitful
brightness
,
these
furrowed
and
grassy
fields
,
each
with
a
sort
of
personality
given
to
it
by
the
capricious
hedgerows
,
 
such
things
as
these
are
the
mother
-
tongue
of
our
imagination
,
the
language
that
is
laden
with
all
the
subtle
,
inextricable
associations
the
fleeting
hours
of
our
childhood
left
behind
them
.
<EOS>
Our
delight
in
the
sunshine
on
the
deep
-
bladed
grass
to
-
day
might
be
no
more
than
the
faint
perception
of
wearied
souls
,
if
it
were
not
for
the
sunshine
and
the
grass
in
the
far
-
off
years
which
still
live
in
us
,
and
transform
our
perception
into
love
.

It
was
Easter
week
,
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
cheesecakes
were
more
exquisitely
light
than
usual
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A

"
Kezia
the
housemaid
said
,
feeling
proud
to
live
under
a
mistress
who
could
make
such
pastry
;
so
that
no
season
or
circumstances
could
have
been
more
propitious
for
a
family
party
,
even
if
it
had
not
been
advisable
to
consult
sister
Glegg
and
sister
Pullet
about
Tom
's
going
to
school
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
as
lief
not
invite
sister
Deane
this
time
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
"
for
she
's
as
jealous
and
having
as
can

<EOS>
's

trying

my
poor
children

<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes

said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
"

<EOS>
I
never

six

That

what

sure
there
's
nobody

your

neither

so
much

And
there
's
sister
Glegg

sister
Pullet

saving
money
unknown

for
they
put

all
their

money

<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
a
mild
woman
,
but
even
a
sheep
will
face
about
a
little
when
she
has
lambs

"

said
Mr.

I
do

said
Mrs.

Maggie

there

you

never

get
off

<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
loving
the
child
as
if
she
was
my
own
;
and
I
'm
sure
she
's
more

Oh

must
put
two
more

"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well

do
as
you
like

Bessy

said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
taking
up
his
hat
and
walking
out
to
the
mill
.
<EOS>
Few
wives
were
more
submissive
than
Mrs.
Tulliver
on
all
points
unconnected
with
her
family
relations
;
but
she
had
been
a
Miss
Dodson
,
and
the
Dodsons
were
a
very
respectable
family
indeed
,
 
as
much
looked
up
to
as
any
in
their
own
parish
,
or
the
next
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
Miss
Dodsons
had
always
been
thought
to
hold
up
their
heads
very
high
,
and
no
one
was
surprised
the
two
eldest
had
married
<EOS>
so
well
,
 
not
at
an
early
age
,
for
that
was
not
the
practice
of
the
Dodson
family
.
<EOS>
There
were
particular
ways
of
doing
everything
in
that
family
:
particular
ways
of
bleaching
the
linen
,
of
making
the
cowslip
wine
,
curing
the
hams
,
and
keeping
the
bottled
gooseberries
;
so
that
no
daughter
of
that
house
could
be
indifferent
to
the
privilege
of
having
been
born
a
Dodson
,
rather
than
a
Gibson
or
a
Watson
.
<EOS>
Funerals
were
always
conducted
with
peculiar
propriety
in
the
Dodson
family
:
the
hat
-
bands
were
never
of
a
blue
shade
,
the
gloves
never
split
at
the
thumb
,
everybody
was
a
mourner
who
ought
to
be
,
and
there
were
always
scarfs
for
the
bearers
.
<EOS>
When
one
of
the
family
was
in
trouble
or
sickness
,
all
the
rest
went
to
visit
the
unfortunate
member
,
usually
at
the
same
time
,
and
did
not
shrink
from
uttering
the
most
disagreeable
truths
that
correct
family
feeling
dictated
;
if
the
illness
or
trouble
was
the
sufferer
's
own
fault
,
it
was
not
in
the
practice
of
the
Dodson
family
to
shrink
from
saying
so
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
there
was
in
this
family
a
peculiar
tradition
as
to
what
was
the
right
thing
in
household
management
and
social
demeanor
,
and
the
only
bitter
circumstance
attending
this
superiority
was
a
painful
inability
to
approve
the
condiments
or
the
conduct
of
families
ungoverned
by
the
Dodson
tradition
.
<EOS>
A
female
Dodson
,
when
in
"
strange
houses
,
"
always
ate
dry
bread
with
her
tea
,
and
declined
any
sort
of
preserves
,
having
no
confidence
in
the
butter
,
and
thinking
that
the
preserves
had
probably
begun
to
ferment
from
want
of
due
sugar
and
boiling
.
<EOS>
There
were
some
Dodsons
less
like
the
family
than
others
,
that
was
admitted
;
but
in
so
far
as
they
were
"
kin
,
"
they
were
of
necessity
better
than
those
who
were
"
no
kin
.
"
<EOS>
And
it
is
remarkable
that
while
no
individual
Dodson
was
satisfied
with
any
other
individual
Dodson
,
each
was
satisfied
,
not
only
with
him
or
her
self
,
but
with
the
Dodsons
collectively
.
<EOS>
The
feeblest
member
of
a
family
 
<EOS>
the
one
who
has
the
least
character
 
is
often
the
merest
epitome
of
the
family
habits
and
traditions
;
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
a
thorough
Dodson
,
though
a
mild
one
,
as
small
-
beer
,
so
long
as
it
is
anything
,
is
only
describable
as
very
weak
ale
:
and
though
she
had
groaned
a
little
in
her
youth
under
the
yoke
of
her
elder
sisters
,
and
still
shed
occasional
tears
at
their
sisterly
reproaches
,
it
was
not
in
Mrs.
Tulliver
to
be
an
innovator
on
the
family
ideas
.
<EOS>
She
was
thankful
to
have
been
a
Dodson
,
and
to
have
one
child
who
took
after
her
own
family
,
at
least
in
his
features
and
complexion
,
in
liking
salt
and
in
eating
beans
,
which
a
Tulliver
never
did
.
  
<EOS>
In
other
respects
the
true
Dodson
was
partly
latent
in
Tom
,
and
he
was
as
far
from
appreciating
his
"
kin
"
on
the
mother
's
side
as
Maggie
herself
,
generally
absconding
for
the
day
with
a
large
supply
of
the
most
portable
food
,
when
he
received
timely
warning
that
his
aunts
and
uncles
were
coming
,
 
a
moral
symptom
from
which
his
aunt
Glegg
deduced
the
gloomiest
views
of
his
future
.
<EOS>
It
was
rather
hard
on
Maggie
that
Tom
always
absconded
without
letting
her
into
the
secret
,
but
the
weaker
sex
are
acknowledged
to
be
serious
_
impedimenta
_
in
cases
of
flight
.
  
<EOS>
On
Wednesday
,
the
day
before
the
aunts
and
uncles
were
coming
,
there
were
such
various
and
suggestive
scents
,
as
of
plumcakes
in
the
oven
and
jellies
in
the
hot
state
,
mingled
with
the
aroma
of
gravy
,
that
it
was
impossible
to
feel
altogether
gloomy
:
there
was
hope
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
Tom
and
Maggie
made
several
inroads
into
the
kitchen
,
and
,
like
other
marauders
,
were
induced
to
keep
aloof
for
a
time
only
by
being
allowed
to
carry
away
a
sufficient
load
of
booty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
"
said
Maggie
,
as
they
sat
on
the
boughs
of
the
elder
-
tree
,
eating
their
jam
-
puffs
,
"
shall
you
run
away
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Tom
,
slowly
,
when
he
had
finished
his
puff
,
and
was
eying
the
third
,
which
was
to
be
divided
between
them
,
 
"
no
,
I
sha'n"t
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Tom
?
<EOS>
Because
Lucy
's
coming
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Tom
,
opening
his
pocket
-
knife
and
holding
it
over
the
puff
,
with
his
head
on
one
side
in
a
dubitative
manner
.
<EOS>
(
It
was
a
difficult
problem
to
divide
that
very
irregular
polygon
into
two
equal
parts
.
)
<EOS>
"
What
do
_
<EOS>
I
_
care
about
Lucy
?
<EOS>
She
's
only
a
girl
,
 
_
<EOS>
she
_
ca
n't
play
at
bandy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
the
tipsy
-
cake
,
then
?
"
said
Maggie
,
exerting
her
hypothetic
powers
,
while
she
leaned
forward
toward
Tom
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
hovering
knife
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
you
silly
,
that
'll
be
good
the
day
after
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
pudden
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
the
pudden
's
to
be
,
 
apricot
roll
-
up
 
<EOS>
O
my
buttons
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
interjection
,
the
knife
descended
on
the
puff
,
and
it
was
in
two
,
but
the
result
was
not
satisfactory
to
Tom
,
for
he
still
eyed
the
halves
doubtfully
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
said
,
    
"
Shut
your
eyes
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
for
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
mind
what
for
.
<EOS>
Shut
'em
when
I
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
obeyed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
which'll
you
have
,
Maggie
,
 
right
hand
or
left
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
have
that
with
the
jam
run
out
,
"
said
Maggie
,
keeping
her
eyes
shut
to
please
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
do
n't
like
that
,
you
silly
.
<EOS>
You
may
have
it
if
it
comes
to
you
fair
,
but
I
sha'n"t
give
it
you
without
.
<EOS>
Right
or
left
<EOS>
,
 
you
choose
,
now
.
<EOS>
Ha
-
a
-
a
!
"
said
Tom
,
in
a
tone
of
exasperation
,
as
Maggie
peeped
.
<EOS>
"
You
keep
your
eyes
shut
,
now
,
else
you
sha'n"t
have
any
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
power
of
sacrifice
did
not
extend
so
far
;
indeed
,
I
fear
she
cared
less
<EOS>
that
Tom
should
enjoy
the
utmost
possible
amount
of
puff
,
than
that
he
should
be
pleased
with
her
for
giving
him
the
best
bit
.
<EOS>
So
she
shut
her
eyes
quite
close
,
till
Tom
told
her
to
"
say
which
,
"
and
then
she
said
,
"
Left
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
got
it
,
"
said
Tom
,
in
rather
a
bitter
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
the
bit
with
the
jam
run
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
;
here
,
take
it
,
"
said
Tom
,
firmly
,
handing
,
decidedly
the
best
piece
to
Maggie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
please
,
Tom
,
have
it
;
I
do
n't
mind
 
<EOS>
I
like
the
other
;
please
take
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
sha'n"t
,
"
said
Tom
,
almost
crossly
,
beginning
on
his
own
inferior
piece
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
,
thinking
it
was
no
use
to
contend
further
,
began
too
,
and
ate
up
her
half
puff
with
considerable
relish
as
well
as
rapidity
.
<EOS>
But
Tom
had
finished
first
,
and
had
to
look
on
while
Maggie
ate
her
last
morsel
or
two
,
feeling
in
himself
a
capacity
for
more
.
<EOS>
Maggie
did
n't
know
Tom
was
looking
at
her
;
she
was
seesawing
on
the
elder
-
bough
,
lost
to
almost
everything
but
a
vague
sense
of
jam
and
idleness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
greedy
thing
!
<EOS>
"
said
Tom
,
when
she
had
swallowed
the
last
morsel
.
<EOS>
He
was
conscious
of
having
acted
very
fairly
,
and
thought
she
ought
to
have
considered
this
,
and
made
up
to
him
for
it
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
refused
a
bit
of
hers
beforehand
,
but
one
is
naturally
at
a
different
point
of
view
before
and
after
one
's
own
share
of
puff
is
swallowed
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
turned
quite
pale
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Tom
,
why
did
n't
you
ask
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
n't
going
to
ask
you
for
a
bit
,
you
greedy
.
<EOS>
You
might
have
thought
of
it
without
,
when
you
knew
I
gave
you
the
best
bit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
wanted
you
to
have
it
;
you
know
I
did
,
"
said
Maggie
,
in
an
injured
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
I
was
n't
going
to
do
what
was
n't
fair
,
like
Spouncer
.
<EOS>
He
always
takes
the
best
bit
,
if
you
do
n't
punch
him
for
it
;
and
if
you
choose
the
best
with
your
eyes
shut
,
he
changes
his
hands
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
go
halves
,
I
'll
go
'em
fair
;
only
I
would
n't
be
a
greedy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
cutting
innuendo
,
Tom
jumped
down
from
his
bough
,
and
threw
a
stone
with
a
"
hoigh
!
"
<EOS>
as
a
friendly
attention
to
Yap
,
who
had
also
been
looking
on
while
the
eatables
vanished
,
with
an
agitation
of
his
ears
and
feelings
which
could
hardly
have
been
without
bitterness
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
excellent
dog
accepted
Tom
's
attention
with
as
much
alacrity
as
if
he
had
been
treated
quite
generously
.
  
<EOS>
But
Maggie
,
gifted
with
that
superior
power
of
misery
which
distinguishes
the
human
being
,
and
places
him
at
a
proud
distance
from
the
most
melancholy
chimpanzee
,
sat
still
on
her
bough
,
and
gave
herself
up
to
the
keen
sense
of
unmerited
reproach
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
given
the
world
not
to
have
eaten
all
her
puff
,
and
to
have
saved
some
of
it
for
Tom
.
<EOS>
Not
but
that
the
puff
was
very
nice
,
for
Maggie
's
palate
was
not
at
all
obtuse
,
but
she
would
have
gone
without
it
many
times
over
,
sooner
than
Tom
should
call
her
greedy
and
be
cross
with
her
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
said
he
would
n't
have
it
,
and
she
ate
it
without
thinking
;
how
could
she
help
it
?
<EOS>
The
tears
flowed
so
plentifully
that
Maggie
saw
nothing
around
her
for
the
next
ten
minutes
;
but
by
that
time
resentment
began
to
give
way
to
the
desire
of
reconciliation
,
and
she
jumped
from
her
bough
to
look
for
Tom
.
<EOS>
He
was
no
longer
in
the
paddock
behind
the
rickyard
;
where
was
he
likely
to
be
gone
,
and
Yap
with
him
?
<EOS>
Maggie
ran
to
the
high
bank
against
the
great
holly
-
tree
,
where
she
could
see
far
away
toward
the
Floss
.
<EOS>
There
was
Tom
;
but
her
heart
sank
again
as
she
saw
how
far
off
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
great
river
,
and
that
he
had
another
companion
besides
Yap
,
 
naughty
Bob
Jakin
,
whose
official
,
if
not
natural
,
function
of
frightening
the
birds
was
just
now
at
a
standstill
.
<EOS>
Maggie
felt
sure
that
Bob
was
wicked
,
without
very
distinctly
knowing
why
;
unless
it
was
because
Bob
's
mother
was
a
dreadfully
large
fat
woman
,
who
lived
at
a
queer
round
house
down
the
river
;
and
once
,
when
Maggie
and
Tom
had
wandered
thither
,
there
rushed
out
a
brindled
dog
that
would
n't
stop
barking
;
and
when
Bob
's
mother
came
out
after
it
,
and
screamed
above
the
barking
to
tell
them
not
to
be
frightened
,
Maggie
thought
she
was
scolding
them
fiercely
,
and
her
heart
beat
with
terror
.
<EOS>
Maggie
thought
it
very
likely
that
the
round
house
had
snakes
on
the
floor
,
and
bats
in
the
bedroom
;
for
she
had
seen
Bob
take
off
his
cap
to
show
Tom
a
little
snake
that
was
inside
it
,
and
another
time
he
had
a
handful
of
young
bats
:
altogether
,
he
was
an
irregular
character
,
perhaps
even
slightly
diabolical
,
judging
from
his
intimacy
with
snakes
and
bats
;
and
to
crown
all
,
when
Tom
had
Bob
for
a
companion
<EOS>
,
he
did
n't
mind
about
Maggie
,
and
would
never
let
her
go
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
owned
that
Tom
was
fond
of
Bob
's
company
.
<EOS>
How
could
it
be
otherwise
?
<EOS>
Bob
knew
,
<EOS>
directly
he
saw
a
bird
's
egg
,
whether
it
was
a
swallow
's
,
or
a
tomtit
's
,
or
a
yellow
-
hammer
's
;
he
found
out
all
the
wasps
'
nests
,
and
could
set
all
sort
of
traps
;
he
could
climb
the
trees
like
a
squirrel
,
and
had
quite
a
magical
power
of
detecting
hedgehogs
and
stoats
;
and
he
had
courage
to
do
things
that
were
rather
naughty
,
such
as
making
gaps
in
the
hedgerows
,
throwing
stones
after
the
sheep
,
and
killing
a
cat
that
was
wandering
_
incognito
_
.
  
<EOS>
Such
qualities
in
an
inferior
,
who
could
always
be
treated
with
authority
in
spite
of
his
superior
knowingness
,
had
necessarily
a
fatal
fascination
for
Tom
;
and
every
holiday
-
time
Maggie
was
sure
to
have
days
of
grief
because
he
had
gone
off
with
Bob
.
  
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
there
was
no
hope
for
it
;
he
was
gone
now
,
and
Maggie
could
think
of
no
comfort
but
to
sit
down
by
the
hollow
,
or
wander
by
the
hedgerow
,
and
fancy
<EOS>
it
was
all
different
,
refashioning
her
little
world
into
just
what
she
should
like
it
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
was
a
troublous
life
,
and
this
was
the
form
in
which
she
took
her
opium
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Tom
,
forgetting
all
about
Maggie
and
the
sting
of
reproach
which
he
had
left
in
her
heart
,
was
hurrying
along
with
Bob
,
whom
he
had
met
accidentally
,
to
the
scene
of
a
great
rat
-
catching
in
a
neighboring
barn
.
<EOS>
Bob
knew
all
about
this
particular
affair
,
and
spoke
of
the
sport
with
an
enthusiasm
which
no
one
who
is
not
either
divested
of
all
manly
feeling
,
or
pitiably
ignorant
of
rat
-
catching
,
can
fail
to
imagine
.
<EOS>
For
a
person
suspected
of
preternatural
wickedness
,
Bob
was
really
not
so
very
villanous
-
looking
;
there
was
even
something
agreeable
in
his
snub
-
nosed
face
,
with
its
close
-
curled
border
of
red
hair
.
<EOS>
But
then
his
trousers
were
always
rolled
up
at
the
knee
,
for
the
convenience
of
wading
on
the
slightest
notice
;
and
his
virtue
,
supposing
it
to
exist
,
was
undeniably
"
virtue
in
rags
,
"
which
,

"
I
know
the
chap

owns
the
ferrets

"
said
Bob
,
in
a
hoarse
treble
voice
,
as
he
shuffled
along
,
keeping
his
blue
eyes
fixed
on
the
river
,
like
an
amphibious
animal
who
foresaw
occasion
for
darting
in
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
lives
up

Kennel
Yard

He
's
the

<EOS>
I

Why

there

"
<EOS>
Bob
continued
,
pointing
with
an
air
of
disgust
toward
Yap
,
"
he
's
no
more
good
wi
'
a

<EOS>
I
see
it
myself

I

"
  
<EOS>
Yap
,
feeling
the
withering
influence
of
this
scorn
,
tucked
his
tail
in
and
shrank
close
to
Tom
's
leg
,
who
felt
a
little
hurt
for
him
,
but
had
not
the
superhuman
courage
to
seem
behindhand
with
Bob
in
contempt
for
a
dog
who
made
so
poor
a
figure
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
he
said
,
"
Yap
's
no
good
at

<EOS>
I
'll
have

said

eagerly
,
 
"

<EOS>
But
they

"
added
Bob
,
by
way
of
note
or
addendum
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
I
say
,
Bob
,
"
said
Tom
,
in
a
tone
of
deliberation
,
"
ferrets
are
nasty
biting
things
,
 
they
'll
bite
a

without

"

<EOS>

"
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
striking
incident
made
the
boys
pause
suddenly
in
their
walk
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
plunging
of
some
small
body
in
the
water
from
among
the
neighboring
bulrushes
;
if
it
was
not
a
water
-
rat
,
Bob
intimated
that
he
was
ready
to
undergo
the
most
unpleasant
consequences
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hoigh
!
<EOS>
Yap
,
 
hoigh
!
<EOS>
there
he
is
,
"
said
Tom
,
clapping
his
hands
,
as
the
little
black
snout
made
its
arrowy
course
to
the
opposite
bank
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Seize
him
,
lad
!
<EOS>
seize
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Yap
agitated
his
ears
and
wrinkled
his
brows
,
but
declined
to
plunge
,
trying
whether
barking
would
not
answer
the
purpose
just
as
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ugh
!
<EOS>
you
coward
!
"
said
Tom
,
and
kicked
him
over
,
feeling
humiliated
as
a
sportsman
to
possess
so
poor
-
spirited
an
animal
.
<EOS>
Bob
abstained
from
remark
and
passed
on
,
choosing
,
however
,
to
walk
in
the
shallow
edge
of
the
overflowing
river
by
way
of
change
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
none
so
full
now
,
the
Floss
is
n't
,
"
said
Bob
,
as
he
kicked
the
water
up
before
him
,
with
an
agreeable
sense
of
being
insolent
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
last
'
ear
,
the
meadows
was
all
one
sheet
o
'
water
,
they
was
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
but
,
"
said
Tom
,
whose
mind
was
prone
to
see
an
opposition
between
statements
that
were
really
accordant
,
 
"
but
there
was
a
big
flood
once
,
when
the
Round
Pool
was
made
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
know
there
was
,
"
cause
father
says
so
.
<EOS>
And
the
sheep
and
cows
all
drowned
,
and
the
boats
went
all
over
the
fields
ever
such
a
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
_
I
_
do
n't
care
about
a
flood
comin
'
,
"
said
Bob
;
"
I
do
n't
mind
the
water
,
no
more
nor
the
land
.
<EOS>
I
'd
swim
,
<EOS>
_
I
_
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
but
if
you
got
nothing
to
eat
for
ever
so
long
?
<EOS>
"
said
Tom
,
his
imagination
becoming
quite
active
under
the
stimulus
of
that
dread
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
'm
a
man
,
I
shall
make
a
boat
with
a
wooden
house
on
the
top
of
it
,
like
Noah
's
ark
,
and
keep
plenty
to
eat
in
it
,
 
rabbits
and
things
,
 
all
ready
.
<EOS>
And
then
if
the
flood
came
,
you
know
,
Bob
,
I
should
n't
mind
.
<EOS>
And
I
'd
take
you
in
,
if
I
saw
you
swimming
,
"
he
added
,
in
the
tone
of
a
benevolent
patron
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
are
n't
frighted
,
"
said
Bob
,
to
whom
hunger
did
not
appear
so
appalling
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
'd
get
in
an
'
knock
the
rabbits
on
th
'
head
when
you
wanted
to
eat
'
em
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
and
I
should
have
halfpence
,
and
we
'd
play
at
heads
-
and
-
tails
,
"
said
Tom
,
not
contemplating
the
possibility
that
this
recreation
might
have
fewer
charms
for
his
mature
age
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
divide
fair
to
begin
with
,
and
then
we
'd
see
who
'd
win
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
a
halfpenny
o
'
my
own
,
"
said
Bob
,
proudly
,
coming
out
of
the
water
and
tossing
his
halfpenny
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yeads
or
tails
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tails
,
"
said
Tom
,
instantly
fired
with
the
desire
to
win
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
yeads
,
"
said
Bob
,
hastily
,
snatching
up
the
halfpenny
as
it
fell
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
n't
,
"
said
Tom
,
loudly
and
peremptorily
.
<EOS>
"
You
give
me
the
halfpenny
;
I
've
won
it
fair
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
sha'n"t
,
"
said
Bob
,
holding
it
tight
in
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
make
you
;
see
if
I
do
n't
,
"
said
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
make
me
do
nothing
,
you
ca
n't
,
"
said
Bob
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
you
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
'll
make
you
care
,
you
cheat
,
"
said
Tom
,
collaring
Bob
and
shaking
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
get
out
wi
'
you
,
"
said
Bob
,
giving
Tom
a
kick
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
's
blood
was
thoroughly
up
:
he
went
at
Bob
with
a
lunge
and
threw
him
down
,
but
Bob
seized
hold
and
kept
it
like
a
cat
,
and
pulled
Tom
down
after
him
.
<EOS>
They
struggled
fiercely
on
the
ground
for
a
moment
or
two
,
till
Tom
,
pinning
Bob
down
by
the
shoulders
,
thought
he
had
the
mastery
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
You
_
,
say
you
'll
give
me
the
halfpenny
now
,
"
he
said
,
with
difficulty
,
while
he
exerted
himself
to
keep
the
command
of
Bob
's
arms
.
  
<EOS>
But
at
this
moment
Yap
,
who
had
been
running
on
before
,
returned
barking
to
the
scene
of
action
,
and
saw
a
favorable
opportunity
for
biting
Bob
's
bare
leg
not
only
with
inpunity
but
with
honor
.
<EOS>
The
pain
from
Yap
's
teeth
,
instead
of
surprising
Bob
into
a
relaxation
of
his
hold
,
gave
it
a
fiercer
tenacity
,
and
with
a
new
exertion
of
his
force
he
pushed
Tom
backward
and
got
uppermost
.
<EOS>
But
now
Yap
,
who
could
get
no
sufficient
purchase
before
,
set
his
teeth
in
a
new
place
,
so
that
Bob
,
harassed
in
this
way
,
let
go
his
hold
of
Tom
,
and
,
almost
throttling
Yap
,
flung
him
into
the
river
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
Tom
was
up
again
,
and
before
Bob
had
quite
recovered
his
balance
after
the
act
of
swinging
Yap
,
Tom
fell
upon
him
,
threw
him
down
,
and
got
his
knees
firmly
on
Bob
's
chest
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
give
me
the
halfpenny
now
,
"
said
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
it
,
"
said
Bob
,
sulkily
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
sha'n"t
take
it
;
you
give
it
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bob
took
the
halfpenny
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
threw
it
away
from
him
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
loosed
his
hold
,
and
left
Bob
to
rise
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
the
halfpenny
lies
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
your
halfpenny
;
I
would
n't
have
kept
it
.
<EOS>
But
you
wanted
to
cheat
;
I
hate
a
cheat
.
<EOS>
I
sha'n"t
go
along
with
you
any
more
,
"
he
added
,
turning
round
homeward
,
not
without
casting
a
regret
toward
the
rat
-
catching
and
other
pleasures
which
he
must
relinquish
along
with
Bob
's
society
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
let
it
alone
,
then
,
"
Bob
called
out
after
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
cheat
if
I
like
;
there
's
no
fun
i
'
playing
else
;
and
I
know
where
there
's
a
goldfinch
's
nest
,
but
I
'll
take
care
<EOS>
_
you
_
do
n't
.
<EOS>
An
'
you
're
a
nasty
fightin
'
turkey
-
cock
,
you
are
   
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
walked
on
without
looking
around
,
and
Yap
followed
his
example
,
the
cold
bath
having
moderated
his
passions
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
along
wi
'
you
,
then
,
wi
'
your
drowned
dog
;
I
would
n't
own
such
a
dog
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
<EOS>
would
n't
,
"
said
Bob
,
getting
louder
,
in
a
last
effort
to
sustain
his
defiance
.
<EOS>
But
Tom
was
not
to
be
provoked
into
turning
round
,
and
Bob
's
voice
began
to
falter
a
little
as
he
said
,
    
<EOS>
"
An
'
I'n
gi'en
you
everything
<EOS>
,
an
'
showed
you
everything
,
an
'
niver
wanted
nothin'
from
you
.
<EOS>
An
'
there
's
your
horn
-
handed
knife
,
then
as
you
gi'en
me
.
"
<EOS>
Here
Bob
flung
the
knife
as
far
as
he
could
after
Tom
's
retreating
footsteps
.
<EOS>
But
it
produced
no
effect
,
except
the
sense
in
Bob
's
mind
that
there
was
a
terrible
void
in
his
lot
,
now
that
knife
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
He
stood
still
till
Tom
had
passed
through
the
gate
and
disappeared
behind
the
hedge
.
<EOS>
The
knife
would
do
not
good
on
the
ground
there
;
it
would
n't
vex
Tom
;
and
pride
or
resentment
was
a
feeble
passion
in
Bob
's
mind
compared
with
the
love
of
a
pocket
-
knife
.
<EOS>
His
very
fingers
sent
entreating
thrills
that
he
would
go
and
clutch
that
familiar
rough
buck's
-
horn
handle
,
which
they
had
so
often
grasped
for
mere
affection
,
as
it
lay
idle
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
And
there
were
two
blades
,
and
they
had
just
been
sharpened
!
<EOS>
What
is
life
without
a
pocket
-
knife
to
him
who
has
once
tasted
a
higher
existence
?
<EOS>
No
;
to
throw
the
handle
after
the
hatchet
is
a
comprehensible
act
of
desperation
,
but
to
throw
one
's
pocket
-
knife
after
an
implacable
friend
is
clearly
in
every
sense
a
hyperbole
,
or
throwing
beyond
the
mark
.
<EOS>
So
Bob
shuffled
back
to
the
spot
where
the
beloved
knife
lay
in
the
dirt
,
and
felt
quite
a
new
pleasure
in
clutching
it
again
after
the
temporary
separation
,
in
opening
one
blade
after
the
other
,
and
feeling
their
edge
with
his
well
-
hardened
thumb
.
<EOS>
Poor
Bob
!
<EOS>
he
was
not
sensitive
on
the
point
of
honor
,
not
a
chivalrous
character
.
<EOS>
That
fine
moral
aroma
would
not
have
been
thought
much
of
by
the
public
opinion
of
Kennel
Yard
,
which
was
the
very
focus
or
heart
of
Bob
's
world
,
even
if
it
could
have
made
itself
perceptible
there
;
yet
,
for
all
that
,
he
was
not
utterly
a
sneak
and
a
thief
as
our
friend
Tom
had
hastily
decided
.
  
<EOS>
But
Tom
,
you
perceive
,
was
rather
a
Rhadamanthine
personage
,
having
more
than
the
usual
share
of
boy
's
justice
in
him
,
 
the
justice
that
desires
to
hurt
culprits
as
much
as
they
deserve
to
be
hurt
,
and
is
troubled
with
no
doubts
concerning
the
exact
amount
of
their
deserts
.
<EOS>
Maggie
saw
a
cloud
on
his
brow
when
he
came
home
,
which
checked
her
joy
at
his
coming
so
much
sooner
than
she
had
expected
,
and
she
dared
hardly
speak
to
him
as
he
stood
silently
throwing
the
small
gravel
-
stones
into
the
mill
-
dam
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
pleasant
to
give
up
a
rat
-
catching
when
you
have
set
your
mind
on
it
.
<EOS>
But
if
Tom
had
told
his
strongest
feeling
at
that
moment
,
he
would
have
said
,
"
I
'd
do
just
the
same
again
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
his
usual
mode
of
viewing
his
past
actions
;
whereas
Maggie
was
always
wishing
she
had
done
something
different
.
    
<EOS>
Enter
the
Aunts
and
Uncles
  
<EOS>
The
Dodsons
were
certainly
a
handsome
family
,
and
Mrs.
Glegg
was
not
the
least
handsome
of
the
sisters
.
<EOS>
As
she
sat
in
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
arm
-
chair
,
no
impartial
observer
could
have
denied
that
for
a
woman
of
fifty
she
had
a
very
comely
face
and
figure
,
though
Tom
and
Maggie
considered
their
aunt
Glegg
as
the
type
of
ugliness
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
she
despised
the
advantages
of
costume
,
for
though
,
as
she
often
observed
,
no
woman
had
better
clothes
,
it
was
not
her
way
to
wear
her
new
things
out
before
her
old
ones
.
<EOS>
Other
women
,
if
they
liked
,
might
have
their
best
thread
-
lace
in
every
wash
;
but
when
Mrs.
Glegg
died
,
it
would
be
found
that
she
had
better
lace
laid
by
in
the
right
-
hand
drawer
of
her
wardrobe
in
the
Spotted
Chamber
than
ever
Mrs.
Wooll
of
St.
Ogg
's
had
bought
in
her
life
,
although
Mrs.
Wooll
wore
her
lace
before
it
was
paid
for
.
<EOS>
So
of
her
curled
fronts
:
Mrs.
Glegg
had
doubtless
the
glossiest
and
crispest
brown
curls
in
her
drawers
,
as
well
as
curls
in
various
degrees
of
fuzzy
laxness
;
but
to
look
out
on
the
week
-
day
world
from
under
a
crisp
and
glossy
front
would
be
to
introduce
a
most
dreamlike
and
unpleasant
confusion
between
the
sacred
and
the
secular
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
,
indeed
,
Mrs.
Glegg
wore
one
of
her
third
-
best
fronts
on
a
week
-
day
visit
,
but
not
at
a
sister
's
house
;
especially
not
at
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
,
who
,
since
her
marriage
,
had
hurt
her
sister
's
feelings
greatly
by
wearing
her
own
hair
,
though
,
as
Mrs.
Glegg
observed
to
Mrs.
Deane
,
a
mother
of
a
family
,
like
Bessy
,
with
a
husband
always
going
to
law
,
might
have
been
expected
to
know
better
.
<EOS>
But
Bessy
was
always
weak
!
  
<EOS>
So
if
Mrs.
Glegg
's
front
to
-
day
was
more
fuzzy
and
lax
than
usual
,
she
had
a
design
under
it
<EOS>
:
she
intended
the
most
pointed
and
cutting
allusion
to
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
bunches
of
blond
curls
,
separated
from
each
other
by
a
due
wave
of
smoothness
on
each
side
of
the
parting
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
shed
tears
several
times
at
sister
Glegg
's
unkindness
on
the
subject
of
these
unmatronly
curls
,
but
the
consciousness
of
looking
the
handsomer
for
them
naturally
administered
support
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
chose
to
wear
her
bonnet
in
the
house
to
-
day
,
 
untied
and
tilted
slightly
,
of
course
 
a
frequent
practice
of
hers
when
she
was
on
a
visit
,
and
happened
to
be
in
a
severe
humor
:
she
did
n't
know
what
draughts
there
might
be
in
strange
houses
.
<EOS>
For
the
same
reason
she
wore
a
small
sable
tippet
,
which
reached
just
to
her
shoulders
,
and
was
very
far
from
meeting
across
her
well
-
formed
chest
,
while
her
long
neck
was
protected
by
a
_
chevaux
-
de
-
frise
_
of
miscellaneous
frilling
.
<EOS>
One
would
need
to
be
learned
in
the
fashions
of
those
times
to
know
how
far
in
the
rear
of
them
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
's
slate
-
colored
silk
gown
must
have
been
;
but
from
certain
constellations
of
small
yellow
spots
upon
it
,
and
a
mouldy
odor
about
it
suggestive
of
a
damp
clothes
-
chest
,
it
was
probable
that
it
belonged
to
a
stratum
of
garments
just
old
enough
to
have
come
recently
into
wear
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
held
her
large
gold
watch
in
her
hand
with
the
many
-
doubled
chain
round
her
fingers
,
and
observed
to
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
who
had
just
returned
from
a
visit
to
the
kitchen
,
that
whatever
it
might
be
by
other
people
's
clocks
and
watches
,
it
was
gone
half
-
past
twelve
by
hers
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
ails
sister
Pullet
,
"
she
continued
.
<EOS>
"
It
used
to
be
the
way
in
our
family
for
one
to
be
as
early
as
another
,
 
I
'm
sure
it
was
so
in
my
poor
father
's
time
,
 
and
not
for
one
sister
to
sit
half
an
hour
before
the
others
came
.
<EOS>
But
if
the
ways
<EOS>
o
'
the
family
are
altered
,
it
sha'n"t
be
_
<EOS>
my
_
fault
<EOS>
;
_
I
'll
_
never
be
the
one
to
come
into
a
house
when
all
the
rest
are
going
away
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
_
at
_
sister
Deane
,
 
she
used
to
be
more
like
me
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
'll
take
my
advice
,
Bessy
,
you
'll
put
the
dinner
forrard
a
bit
,
sooner
than
put
it
back
,
because
folks
are
late
as
ought
to
ha
'
known
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
there
's
no
fear
but
what
they
'll
be
all
here
in
time
,
sister
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
in
her
mild
-
peevish
tone
.
<EOS>
"
The
dinner
wo
n't
be
ready
till
half
-
past
one
.
<EOS>
But
if
it
's
long
for
you
to
wait
,
let
me
fetch
you
a
cheesecake
and
a
glass
o
'
<EOS>
wine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Bessy
!
"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
with
a
bitter
smile
and
a
scarcely
perceptible
toss
of
her
head
,
"
I
should
ha
'
thought
you
'd
known
your
own
sister
better
.
<EOS>
I
never
_
did
_
eat
between
meals
,
and
I
'm
not
going
to
begin
.
<EOS>
Not
but
what
I
hate
that
nonsense
of
having
your
dinner
at
half
-
past
one
,
when
you
might
have
it
at
one
.
<EOS>
You
was
never
brought
up
in
that
way
,
Bessy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Jane
,
what
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
does
n't
like
his
dinner
before
two
o'clock
,
but
I
put
it
half
an
hour
earlier
because
o
'
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
I
know
how
it
is
with
husbands
,
 
<EOS>
they
're
for
putting
everything
off
;
they
'll
put
the
dinner
off
till
after
tea
,
if
they
've
got
wives
as
are
weak
enough
to
give
in
to
such
work
;
but
it
's
a
pity
for
you
,
Bessy
,
as
you
have
n't
got
more
strength
<EOS>
o
'
mind
.
<EOS>
It
'll
be
well
if
your
children
do
n't
suffer
for
it
.
<EOS>
And
I
hope
you
've
not
gone
and
got
a
great
dinner
for
us
,
 
going
to
expense
for
your
sisters
,
as
'
ud
sooner
eat
a
crust
o
'
dry
bread
nor
help
to
ruin
you
with
extravagance
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
you
do
n't
take
pattern
by
your
sister
Deane
;
she
's
far
more
sensible
.
<EOS>
And
here
you
've
got
two
children
to
provide
for
,
and
your
husband
's
spent
your
fortin
<EOS>
i
'
going
to
law
,
and
's
likely
to
spend
his
own
too
.
<EOS>
A
boiled
joint
,
as
you
could
make
broth
of
for
the
kitchen
<EOS>
,
"
Mrs.
Glegg
added
,
in
a
tone
of
emphatic
protest
,
"
and
a
plain
pudding
,
with
a
spoonful
o
'
sugar
,
and
no
spice
,
'
ud
be
far
more
becoming
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
sister
Glegg
in
this
humor
,
there
was
a
cheerful
prospect
for
the
day
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
never
went
the
length
of
quarrelling
with
her
,
any
more
than
a
water
-
fowl
that
puts
out
its
leg
in
a
deprecating
manner
can
be
said
to
quarrel
with
a
boy
who
throws
stones
.
<EOS>
But
this
point
of
the
dinner
was
a
tender
one
,
and
not
at
all
new
,
so
that
Mrs.
Tulliver
could
make
the
same
answer
she
had
often
made
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
says
he
always
_
will
_
have
a
good
dinner
for
his
friends
while
he
can
pay
for
it
,
"
she
said
;
"
and
he
's
a
right
to
do
as
he
likes
in
his
own
house
,
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Bessy
,
_
I
_
ca
n't
leave
your
children
enough
out
<EOS>
o
'
my
savings
to
keep
'em
from
ruin
.
<EOS>
And
you
must
n't
look
to
having
any
o
'
Mr.
Glegg
's
money
,
for
it
's
well
if
I
do
n't
go
first
,
 
<EOS>
he
comes
of
a
long
-
lived
family
;
and
if
he
was
to
die
and
leave
me
well
for
my
life
,
he
'd
tie
all
the
money
up
to
go
back
to
his
own
kin
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
sound
of
wheels
while
Mrs.
Glegg
was
speaking
was
an
interruption
highly
welcome
to
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
who
hastened
out
to
receive
sister
Pullet
;
it
must
be
sister
Pullet
,
because
the
sound
was
that
of
a
four
-
wheel
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
tossed
her
head
and
looked
rather
sour
about
the
mouth
at
the
thought
of
the
"
four
-
wheel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
had
a
strong
opinion
on
that
subject
.
  
<EOS>
Sister
Pullet
was
in
tears
when
the
one
-
horse
chaise
stopped
before
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
door
,
and
it
was
apparently
requisite
that
she
should
shed
a
few
more
before
getting
out
;
for
though
her
husband
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
stood
ready
to
support
her
,
she
sat
still
and
shook
her
head
sadly
,
as
she
looked
through
her
tears
at
the
vague
distance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
whativer
is
the
matter
,
sister
?
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
an
imaginative
woman
,
but
it
occurred
to
her
that
the
large
toilet
-
glass
in
sister
Pullet
's
best
bedroom
was
possibly
broken
for
the
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
reply
but
a
further
shake
of
the
head
,
as
Mrs.
Pullet
slowly
rose
and
got
down
from
the
chaise
,
not
without
casting
a
glance
at
Mr.
Pullet
to
see
that
he
was
guarding
her
handsome
silk
dress
from
injury
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Pullet
was
a
small
man
,
with
a
high
nose
,
small
twinkling
eyes
,
and
thin
lips
,
in
a
fresh
-
looking
suit
of
black
and
a
white
cravat
,
that
seemed
to
have
been
tied
very
tight
on
some
higher
principle
than
that
of
mere
personal
ease
.
<EOS>
He
bore
about
the
same
relation
to
his
tall
,
good
-
looking
wife
,
with
her
balloon
sleeves
,
abundant
mantle
,
and
a
large
befeathered
and
beribboned
bonnet
,
as
a
small
fishing
-
smack
bears
to
a
brig
with
all
its
sails
spread
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
pathetic
sight
and
a
striking
example
of
the
complexity
introduced
into
the
emotions
by
a
high
state
of
civilization
,
the
sight
of
a
fashionably
dressed
female
in
grief
.
<EOS>
From
the
sorrow
of
a
Hottentot
to
that
of
a
woman
in
large
buckram
sleeves
,
with
several
bracelets
on
each
arm
,
an
architectural
bonnet
,
and
delicate
ribbon
strings
,
what
a
long
series
of
gradations
!
<EOS>
In
the
enlightened
child
of
civilization
the
abandonment
characteristic
of
grief
is
checked
and
varied
in
the
subtlest
manner
,
so
as
to
present
an
interesting
problem
to
the
analytic
mind
.
<EOS>
If
,
with
a
crushed
heart
and
eyes
half
blinded
by
the
mist
of
tears
,
she
were
to
walk
with
a
too
-
devious
step
through
a
door
-
place
,
she
might
crush
her
buckram
sleeves
too
,
and
the
deep
consciousness
of
this
possibility
produces
a
composition
of
forces
by
which
she
takes
a
line
that
just
clears
the
door
-
post
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
that
the
tears
are
hurrying
fast
,
she
unpins
her
strings
and
throws
them
languidly
backward
,
a
touching
gesture
,
indicative
,
even
in
the
deepest
gloom
,
of
the
hope
in
future
dry
moments
when
cap
-
strings
will
once
more
have
a
charm
.
<EOS>
As
the
tears
subside
a
little
,
and
with
her
head
leaning
backward
at
the
angle
that
will
not
injure
her
bonnet
,
she
endures
that
terrible
moment
when
grief
,
which
has
made
all
things
else
a
weariness
,
has
itself
become
weary
;
she
looks
down
pensively
at
her
bracelets
,
and
adjusts
their
clasps
with
that
pretty
studied
fortuity
which
would
be
gratifying
to
her
mind
if
it
were
once
more
in
a
calm
and
healthy
state
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pullet
brushed
each
door
-
post
with
great
nicety
,
about
the
latitude
of
her
shoulders
(
at
that
period
a
woman
was
truly
ridiculous
to
an
instructed
eye
if
she
did
not
measure
a
yard
and
a
half
across
the
shoulders
)
,
and
having
done
that
sent
the
muscles
of
her
face
in
quest
of
fresh
tears
as
she
advanced
into
the
parlor
where
Mrs.
Glegg
was
seated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sister
,
you
're
late
;
what
's
the
matter
?
"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
rather
sharply
,
as
they
shook
hands
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pullet
sat
down
,
lifting
up
her
mantle
carefully
behind
,
before
she
answered
,
    
"
She
's
gone
,
"
unconsciously
using
an
impressive
figure
of
rhetoric
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
the
glass
this
time
,
then
,
"
thought
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
  
<EOS>
"
Died
the
day
before
yesterday

"
continued
Mrs.
Pullet
;
"
an
'
her
legs
was
as
thick
as
my
body

"
"
she
added
,
with
deep
sadness
,
after
a
pause
.
<EOS>
"
They

tapped
her
no

<EOS>
"
Well

Sophy
,
it
's
a
mercy
<EOS>
she
's
gone
,
then
,
whoever
she
may
be

"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
with
the
promptitude
and
emphasis
of
a
mind
naturally
clear
and
decided
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
ca
n't
think
who
you
're
talking
of

for
my
part

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
_
I

said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
sighing
and
shaking
her
head
;
"

there
is

another

said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
who
always
cried
just
as
much
as
was
proper
when
anything
happened
to
her
own
"
kin
,
"
but
not
on
other
occasions
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
so
much
acquaintance
as
I
've
seen
her
legs
when
they
was
like
bladders
.
<EOS>
And
an
old
lady
as
had
doubled
her
money
over
and
over
again
,
and
kept
it
all
in
her
own
management
to
the
last
,
and
had
her
pocket
with
her
keys
in
under
her
pillow
constant
.
<EOS>
There
is
n't
many
old
_
par_ish'ners
like
her
,
I
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
they
say
she
'd
took
as
much
physic
as
'
ud
fill
a
wagon
,
"
observed
Mr.
Pullet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
sighed
Mrs.
Pullet
,
"
she
'd
another
complaint
ever
so
many
years
before
she
had
the
dropsy
,
and
the
doctors
could
n't
make
out
what
it
was
.
<EOS>
And
she
said
to
me
,
when
I
went
to
see
her
last
Christmas
,
she
said
,
"
Mrs.
Pullet
,
if
ever
you
have
the
dropsy
,
you
'll
think
o
'
me
.
"
<EOS>
She
_
did
_
say
so
,
"
added
Mrs.
Pullet
,
<EOS>
beginning
to
cry
bitterly
again
;
"
those
were
her
very
words
.
<EOS>
And
she
's
to
be
buried
o
'
Saturday
,
and
Pullet
's
bid
to
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Sophy
,
"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
unable
any
longer
to
contain
her
spirit
of
rational
remonstrance
,
 
<EOS>
"
Sophy
,
I
wonder
_
at
_
you
,
fretting
and
injuring
your
health
about
people
as
do
n't
belong
to
you
.
<EOS>
Your
poor
father
never
did
so
,
nor
your
aunt
Frances
neither
,
nor
any
o
'
the
family
as
I
ever
heard
of
.
<EOS>
You
could
n't
fret
no
more
than
this
,
if
we
'd
heared
as
our
cousin
Abbott
had
died
sudden
without
making
his
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pullet
was
silent
,
having
to
finish
her
crying
,
and
rather
flattered
than
indignant
at
being
upbraided
for
crying
too
much
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
everybody
who
could
afford
to
cry
so
much
about
their
neighbors
who
had
left
them
nothing
;
but
Mrs.
Pullet
had
married
a
gentleman
farmer
,
and
had
leisure
and
money
to
carry
her
crying
and
everything
else
to
the
highest
pitch
of
respectability
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Sutton
did
n't
die
without
making
her
will
,
though
,
"
said
Mr.
Pullet
,
with
a
confused
sense
that
he
was
saying
something
to
sanction
his
wife
's
tears
;
"
ours
is
a
rich
parish
,
but
they
say
there
's
nobody
else
to
leave
as
many
thousands
behind
'em
as
Mrs.
Sutton
.
<EOS>
And
she
's
left
no
leggicies
to
speak
on
,
 
left
it
all
in
a
lump
to
her
husband
's
nevvy

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
n't
much
good
<EOS>
i

being
so
rich
,
then
,
"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
"
if
she
'd
got
none
but
husband

kin
to
leave
it
to

<EOS>
It
's
poor
work
when
that
's
all
you
've
got
to
pinch
yourself
for

<EOS>
Not
as
I

one
<EOS>
o

<EOS>
those
as

like
to
die
without
leaving
more
money
out

other
folks
had
reckoned
;

it
's
a
poor
tale
when
it
must
go
out
<EOS>
o

<EOS>
your
own
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
,
sister
,
"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
who
had
recovered
sufficiently
to
take
off
her
veil
and
fold
it
carefully
,
<EOS>
"
it
's
a
nice
sort
o
'
man
as
Mrs.
Sutton
has
left
her
money
to
,
for
he
's
troubled
with
the
asthmy
,
and
goes
to
bed
every
night
at
eight
o'clock
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
about
it
himself
 
<EOS>
as
free
as
could
be
 
<EOS>
one
Sunday
when
he
came
to
our
church
.
<EOS>
He
wears
a
hareskin
on
his
chest
,
and
has
a
trembling
in
his
talk
,
 
quite
a
gentleman
sort
o
'
man
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
there
was
n't
many
months
in
the
year
as
I
was
n't
under
the
doctor
's
hands
.
<EOS>
And
he
said
,
"
Mrs.
Pullet
,
I
can
feel
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
was
what
he
said
,
 
the
very
words
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
sighed
Mrs.
Pullet
,
shaking
her
head
at
the
idea
that
there
were
but
few
who
could
enter
fully
into
her
experiences
in
pink
mixture
and
white
mixture
,
strong
stuff
in
small
bottles
,
and
weak
stuff
in
large
bottles
,
damp
boluses
at
a
shilling
,
and
draughts
at
eighteenpence
.
<EOS>
"
Sister
,
I
may
as
well
go
and
take
my
bonnet
off
now
.
<EOS>
Did
you
see
as
the
cap
-
box
was
put
out
?
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
turning
to
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Pullet
,
by
an
unaccountable
lapse
of
memory
,
had
forgotten
it
,
and
hastened
out
,
with
a
stricken
conscience
,
to
remedy
the
omission
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
'll
bring
it
upstairs
,
sister
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
wishing
to
go
at
once
,
lest
Mrs.
Glegg
should
begin
to
explain
her
feelings
about
Sophy
's
being
the
first
Dodson
who
ever
ruined
her
constitution
with
doctor
's
stuff
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
fond
of
going
upstairs
with
her
sister
Pullet
,
and
looking
thoroughly
at
her
cap
before
she
put
it
on
her
head
,
and
discussing
millinery
in
general
.
<EOS>
This
was
part
of
Bessy
's
weakness
that
stirred
Mrs.
Glegg
's
sisterly
compassion
:
Bessy
went
far
too
well
dressed
,
considering
;
and
she
was
too
proud
to
dress
her
child
in
the
good
clothing
<EOS>
her
sister
Glegg
gave
her
from
the
primeval
strata
of
her
wardrobe
;
it
was
a
sin
and
a
shame
to
buy
anything
to
dress
that
child
,
if
it
was
n't
a
pair
of
shoes
.
<EOS>
In
this
particular
,
however
,
Mrs.
Glegg
did
her
sister
Bessy
some
injustice
,
for
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
really
made
great
efforts
to
induce
Maggie
to
wear
a
leghorn
bonnet
and
a
dyed
silk
frock
made
out
of
her
aunt
Glegg
's
,
but
the
results
had
been
such
that
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
obliged
to
bury
them
in
her
maternal
bosom
;
for
Maggie
,
declaring
that
the
frock
smelt
of
nasty
dye
,
had
taken
an
opportunity
of
basting
it
together
with
the
roast
beef
the
first
Sunday
she
wore
it
,
and
finding
this
scheme
answer
,
she
had
subsequently
pumped
on
the
bonnet
with
its
green
ribbons
,
so
as
to
give
it
a
general
resemblance
to
a
sage
cheese
garnished
with
withered
lettuces
.
<EOS>
I
must
urge
in
excuse
for
Maggie
,
that
Tom
had
laughed
at
her
in
the
bonnet
,
and
said
she
looked
like
an
old
Judy
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Pullet
,
too
,
made
presents
of
clothes
,
but
these
were
always
pretty
enough
to
please
Maggie
as
well
as
her
mother
.
<EOS>
Of
all
her
sisters
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
certainly
preferred
her
sister
Pullet
,
not
without
a
return
of
preference
;
but
Mrs.
Pullet
was
sorry
Bessy
had
those
naughty
,
awkward
children
;
she
would
do
the
best
she
could
by
them
,
but
it
was
a
pity
they
were
n't
as
good
and
as
pretty
as
sister
Deane
's
child
.
<EOS>
Maggie
and
Tom
,
on
their
part
,
thought
their
aunt
Pullet
tolerable
,
chiefly
because
she
was
not
their
aunt
Glegg
.
<EOS>
Tom
always
declined
to
go
more
than
once
during
his
holidays
to
see
either
of
them
.
<EOS>
Both
his
uncles
tipped
him
that
once
,
of
course
;
but
at
his
aunt
Pullet
's
there
were
a
great
many
toads
to
pelt
in
the
cellar
-
area
,
so
that
he
preferred
the
visit
to
her
.
<EOS>
Maggie
shuddered
at
the
toads
,
and
dreamed
of
them
horribly
,
but
she
liked
her
uncle
Pullet
's
musical
snuff
-
box
.
<EOS>
Still
,
it
was
agreed
by
the
sisters
,
in
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
absence
,
that
the
Tulliver
blood
did
not
mix
well
with
the
Dodson
blood
;
that
,
in
fact
,
poor
Bessy
's
children
were
Tullivers
,
and
that
Tom
,
notwithstanding
he
had
the
Dodson
complexion
,
was
likely
to
be
as
"
contrairy
"
as
his
father
.
<EOS>
As
for
Maggie
,
she
was
the
picture
of
her
aunt
Moss
,
Mr.
Tulliver
's
sister
,
 
a
large
-
boned
woman
,
who
had
married
as
poorly
as
could
be
;
had
no
china
,
and
had
a
husband
who
had
much
ado
to
pay
his
rent
.
<EOS>
But
when
Mrs.
Pullet
was
alone
with
Mrs.
Tulliver
upstairs
,
the
remarks
were
naturally
to
the
disadvantage
of
Mrs.
Glegg
,
and
they
agreed
,
in
confidence
,
that
there
was
no
knowing
what
sort
of
fright
sister
Jane
would
come
out
next
.
<EOS>
But
their
_
tête
-
à
-
tête
_
was
curtailed
by
the
appearance
of
Mrs.
Deane
with
little
Lucy
;
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
to
look
on
with
a
silent
pang
while
Lucy
's
blond
curls
were
adjusted
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
unaccountable
that
Mrs.
Deane
,
the
thinnest
and
sallowest
of
all
the
Miss
Dodsons
,
should
have
had
this
child
,
who
might
have
been
taken
for
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
any
day
.
<EOS>
And
Maggie
always
looked
twice
as
dark
as
usual
when
she
was
by
the
side
of
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
to
-
day
,
when
she
and
Tom
came
in
from
the
garden
with
their
father
and
their
uncle
Glegg
.
<EOS>
Maggie
had
thrown
her
bonnet
off
very
carelessly
,
and
coming
in
with
her
hair
rough
as
well
as
out
of
curl
,
rushed
at
once
to
Lucy
,
who
was
standing
by
her
mother
's
knee
.
<EOS>
Certainly
the
contrast
between
the
cousins
was
conspicuous
,
and
to
superficial
eyes
was
very
much
to
the
disadvantage
of
Maggie
though
a
connoisseur
might
have
seen
"
points
"
in
her
which
had
a
higher
promise
for
maturity
than
Lucy
's
natty
completeness
.
<EOS>
It
was
like
the
contrast
between
a
rough
,
dark
,
overgrown
puppy
and
a
white
kitten
.
<EOS>
Lucy
put
up
the
neatest
little
rosebud
mouth
to
be
kissed
;
everything
about
her
was
neat
,
 
her
little
round
neck
,
with
the
row
of
coral
beads
;
her
little
straight
nose
,
not
at
all
snubby
;
her
little
clear
eyebrows
,
rather
darker
than
her
curls
,
to
match
hazel
eyes
,
which
looked
up
with
shy
pleasure
at
Maggie
,
taller
by
the
head
,
though
scarcely
a
year
older
.
<EOS>
Maggie
always
looked
at
Lucy
with
delight
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
fond
of
fancying
a
world
where
the
people
never
got
any
larger
than
children
of
their
own
age
,
and
she
made
the
queen
of
it
just
like
Lucy
,
with
a
little
crown
on
her
head
,
and
a
little
sceptre
in
her
hand
 
only
the
queen
was
Maggie
herself
in
Lucy
's
form
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lucy
,
"
she
burst
out
,
after
kissing
her
,
<EOS>
"
you
'll
stay
with
Tom
and
me
,
wo
n't
you
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
kiss
her
,
Tom
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
,
too
,
had
come
up
to
Lucy
,
but
he
was
not
going
to
kiss
her
 
no
;
he
came
up
to
her
with
Maggie
,
because
it
seemed
easier
,
on
the
whole
,
than
saying
,
"
How
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
to
all
those
aunts
and
uncles
.
<EOS>
He
stood
looking
at
nothing
in
particular
,
with
the
blushing
,
awkward
air
and
semi
-
smile
which
are
common
to
shy
boys
when
in
company
,
 
very
much
as
if
they
had
come
into
the
world
by
mistake
,
and
found
it
in
a
degree
of
undress
that
was
quite
embarrassing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Heyday
!
"
said
aunt
Glegg
,
with
loud
emphasis
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
little
boys
and
gells
come
into
a
room
without
taking
notice
of
their
uncles
and
aunts
?
<EOS>
That
was
n't
the
way
when
_
<EOS>
I
_
was
a
little
gell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
and
speak
to
your
aunts
and
uncles
,
my
dears
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
looking
anxious
and
melancholy
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
to
whisper
to
Maggie
a
command
to
go
and
have
her
hair
brushed
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
and
how
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
And
I
hope
you
're
good
children
,
are
you
?
"
said
Aunt
Glegg
,
in
the
same
loud
,
emphatic
way
,
as
she
took
their
hands
,
hurting
them
with
her
large
rings
,
and
kissing
their
cheeks
much
against
their
desire
.
<EOS>
"
Look
up
,
Tom
,
look
up
.
<EOS>
Boys
as
go
to
boarding
-
schools
should
hold
their
heads
up
.
<EOS>
Look
at
me
now
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tom
declined
that
pleasure
apparently
,
for
he
tried
to
draw
his
hand
away
.
<EOS>
"
Put
your
hair
behind
your
ears
,
Maggie
,
and
keep
your
frock
on
your
shoulder
.
"
  
<EOS>
Aunt
Glegg
always
spoke
to
them
in
this
loud
,
emphatic
way
,
as
if
she
considered
them
deaf
,
or
perhaps
rather
idiotic
;
it
was
a
means
,
she
thought
,
of
making
them
feel
that
they
were
accountable
creatures
,
and
might
be
a
salutary
check
on
naughty
tendencies
.
<EOS>
Bessy
's
children
were
so
spoiled
 
<EOS>
they
'd
need
have
somebody
to
make
them
feel
their
duty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dears
,
"
said
aunt
Pullet
,
in
a
compassionate
voice
,
"
you
grow
wonderful
fast
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
they
'll
outgrow
their
strength
,
"
she
added
,
looking
over
their
heads
,
with
a
melancholy
expression
,
at
their
mother
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
the
gell
has
too
much
hair
.
<EOS>
I
'd
have
it
thinned
and
cut
shorter
,
sister
,
<EOS>
if
I
was
you
;
it
is
n't
good
for
her
health
.
<EOS>
It
's
that
as
makes
her
skin
so
brown
,
I
should
n't
wonder
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
so
,
sister
Deane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
,
I
'm
sure
,
sister
,
"
said
Mrs.
Deane
,
shutting
her
lips
close
again
,
and
looking
at
Maggie
with
a
critical
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
"
the
child
's
healthy
enough
;
there
's
nothing
ails
her
.
<EOS>
There
's
red
wheat
as
well
as
white
,
for
that
matter
,
and
some
like
the
dark
grain
best
.
<EOS>
But
it
'
ud
be
as
well
if
Bessy
'
ud
have
the
child
's
hair
cut
,
so
as
it
'
ud
lie
smooth
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
dreadful
resolve
was
gathering
in
Maggie
's
breast
,
but
it
was
arrested
by
the
desire
to
know
from
her
aunt
Deane
whether
she
would
leave
Lucy
behind
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Deane
would
hardly
ever
let
Lucy
come
to
see
them
.
<EOS>
After
various
reasons
for
refusal
,
Mrs.
Deane
appealed
to
Lucy
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
like
to
stay
behind
without
mother
,
should
you
,
Lucy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
please
,
mother
,
"
said
Lucy
,
timidly
,
blushing
very
pink
all
over
her
little
neck
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
done
,
Lucy
!
<EOS>
Let
her
stay
,
Mrs.
Deane
,
let
her
stay
,
"
said
Mr.
Deane
,
a
large
but
alert
-
looking
man
,
with
a
type
of
_
physique
_
to
be
seen
in
all
ranks
of
English
society
,
 
bald
crown
,
red
whiskers
,
full
forehead
,
and
general
solidity
without
heaviness
.
<EOS>
You
may
see
noblemen
like
Mr.
Deane
,
and
you
may
see
grocers
or
day
-
laborers
like
him
;
but
the
keenness
of
his
brown
eyes
was
less
common
than
his
contour
.
  
<EOS>
He
held
a
silver
snuff
-
box
very
tightly
in
his
hand
,
and
now
and
then
exchanged
a
pinch
with
Mr.
Tulliver
,
whose
box
was
only
silver
-
mounted
,
so
that
it
was
naturally
a
joke
between
them
that
Mr.
Tulliver
wanted
to
exchange
snuff
-
boxes
also
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
's
box
had
been
given
him
by
the
superior
partners
in
the
firm
to
which
he
belonged
,
at
the
same
time
that
they
gave
him
a
share
in
the
business
,
in
acknowledgment
of
his
valuable
services
as
manager
.
<EOS>
No
man
was
thought
more
highly
of
in
St.
Ogg
's
than
Mr.
Deane
;
and
some
persons
were
even
of
opinion
that
Miss
Susan
Dodson
,
who
was
once
held
to
have
made
the
worst
match
of
all
the
Dodson
sisters
,
might
one
day
ride
in
a
better
carriage
,
and
live
in
a
better
house
,
even
than
her
sister
Pullet
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
knowing
where
a
man
would
stop
,
who
had
got
his
foot
into
a
great
mill
-
owning
,
shipowning
business
like
that
of
Guest
&
Co.
,
with
a
banking
concern
attached
.
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Deane
,
as
her
intimate
female
friends
observed
,
was
proud
and
"
having
"
enough
;
_
she
_
would
n't
let
her
husband
stand
still
in
the
world
for
want
of
spurring
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
beckoning
Maggie
to
her
,
and
whispering
in
her
ear
,
as
soon
as
this
point
of
Lucy
's
staying
was
settled
,
"
go
and
get
your
hair
brushed
,
do
,
for
shame
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
not
to
come
in
without
going
to
Martha
first
,
<EOS>
you
know
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tom
come
out
with
me
,
"
whispered
Maggie
,
pulling
his
sleeve
as
she
passed
him
;
and
Tom
followed
willingly
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
upstairs
with
me
,
Tom
,
<EOS>
"
she
whispered
,
when
they
were
outside
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
something
I
want
to
do
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
time
to
play
at
anything
before
dinner
,
"
said
Tom
,
whose
imagination
was
impatient
of
any
intermediate
prospect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
there
is
time
for
this
;
_
do
_
come
,
Tom
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
followed
Maggie
upstairs
into
her
mother
's
room
,
and
saw
her
go
at
once
to
a
drawer
,
from
which
she
took
out
a
large
pair
of
scissors
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
they
for
,
Maggie
?
"
said
Tom
,
feeling
his
curiosity
awakened
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
answered
by
seizing
her
front
locks
and
cutting
them
straight
across
the
middle
of
her
forehead
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
buttons
!
<EOS>
Maggie
,
you
'll
catch
it
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Tom
;
"
you
'd
better
not
cut
any
more
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
Snip
!
<EOS>
went
the
great
scissors
again
while
Tom
was
speaking
,
and
he
could
n't
help
feeling
it
was
rather
good
fun
;
Maggie
would
look
so
queer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
Tom
,
cut
it
behind
for
me
,
"
said
Maggie
,
excited
by
her
own
daring
,
and
anxious
to
finish
the
deed
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
catch
it
,
you
know
,
"
said
Tom
,
nodding
his
head
in
an
admonitory
manner
,
and
hesitating
a
little
as
he
took
the
scissors
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
make
haste
!
"
<EOS>
said
Maggie
,
giving
a
little
stamp
with
her
foot
.
<EOS>
Her
cheeks
were
quite
flushed
.
  
<EOS>
The
black
locks
were
so
thick
,
nothing
could
be
more
tempting
to
a
lad
who
had
already
tasted
the
forbidden
pleasure
of
cutting
the
pony
's
mane
.
<EOS>
I
speak
to
those
who
know
the
satisfaction
of
making
a
pair
of
scissors
meet
through
a
duly
resisting
mass
of
hair
.
<EOS>
One
delicious
grinding
snip
,
and
then
another
and
another
,
and
the
hinder
-
locks
fell
heavily
on
the
floor
,
and
Maggie
stood
cropped
in
a
jagged
,
uneven
manner
,
but
with
a
sense
of
clearness
and
freedom
,
as
if
she
had
emerged
from
a
wood
into
the
open
plain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Maggie
,
"
said
Tom
,
jumping
round
her
,
and
slapping
his
knees
as
he
laughed
,
"
Oh
,
my
buttons
!
<EOS>
what
a
queer
thing
you
look
!
<EOS>
Look
at
yourself
in
the
glass
;
you
look
like
the
idiot
we
throw
out
nutshells
to
at
school
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
felt
an
unexpected
pang
.
<EOS>
She
had
thought
beforehand
chiefly
at
her
own
deliverance
from
her
teasing
hair
and
teasing
remarks
about
it
,
and
something
also
of
the
triumph
she
should
have
over
her
mother
and
her
aunts
by
this
very
decided
course
of
action
;
she
did
n't
want
her
hair
to
look
pretty
,
 
<EOS>
that
was
out
of
the
question
,
 
she
only
wanted
people
to
think
her
a
clever
little
girl
,
and
not
to
find
fault
with
her
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
when
Tom
began
to
laugh
at
her
,
and
say
she
was
like
an
idiot
,
the
affair
had
quite
a
new
aspect
.
<EOS>
She
looked
in
the
glass
,
and
still
Tom
laughed
and
clapped
his
hands
,
and
Maggie
's
cheeks
began
to
pale
,
and
her
lips
to
tremble
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Maggie
,
you
'll
have
to
go
down
to
dinner
directly
,
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
!
"
  
"
Do
n't
laugh
at
me
,
Tom
,
"
said
Maggie
,
in
a
passionate
tone
,
with
an
outburst
of
angry
tears
,
stamping
,
and
giving
him
a
push
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
then
,
spitfire
!
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
cut
it
off
for
,
then
?
<EOS>
I
shall
go
down
:
<EOS>
I
can
smell
the
dinner
going
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
hurried
downstairs
and
left
poor
Maggie
to
that
bitter
sense
of
the
irrevocable
which
was
almost
an
every
-
day
experience
of
her
small
soul
.
<EOS>
She
could
see
clearly
enough
,
now
the
thing
was
done
,
that
it
was
very
foolish
,
and
that
she
should
have
to
hear
and
think
more
about
her
hair
than
ever
;
for
Maggie
rushed
to
her
deeds
with
passionate
impulse
,
and
then
saw
not
only
their
consequences
,
but
what
would
have
happened
if
they
had
not
been
done
,
with
all
the
detail
and
exaggerated
circumstance
of
an
active
imagination
.
<EOS>
Tom
never
did
the
same
sort
of
foolish
things
as
Maggie
,
having
a
wonderful
instinctive
discernment
of
what
would
turn
to
his
advantage
or
disadvantage
;
and
so
it
happened
,
that
though
he
was
much
more
wilful
and
inflexible
than
Maggie
,
his
mother
hardly
ever
called
him
naughty
.
<EOS>
But
if
Tom
did
make
a
mistake
of
that
sort
,
he
espoused
it
,
and
stood
by
it
:
<EOS>
he
"
did
n't
mind
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
broke
the
lash
of
his
father
's
gigwhip
by
lashing
the
gate
,
he
could
n't
help
it
,
 
the
whip
should
n't
have
got
caught
in
the
hinge
.
<EOS>
If
Tom
Tulliver
whipped
a
gate
,
he
was
convinced
,
not
that
the
whipping
of
gates
by
all
boys
was
a
justifiable
act
,
but
that
he
,
Tom
Tulliver
,
was
justifiable
in
whipping
that
particular
gate
,
and
he
was
n't
going
to
be
sorry
.
<EOS>
But
Maggie
,
as
she
stood
crying
before
the
glass
,
felt
it
impossible
that
she
should
go
down
to
dinner
and
endure
the
severe
eyes
and
severe
words
of
her
aunts
,
while
Tom
and
Lucy
,
and
Martha
,
who
waited
at
table
,
and
perhaps
her
father
and
her
uncles
,
would
laugh
at
her
;
for
if
Tom
had
laughed
at
her
,
of
course
every
one
else
would
;
and
if
she
had
only
let
her
hair
alone
,
she
could
have
sat
with
Tom
and
Lucy
,
and
had
the
apricot
pudding
and
the
custard
!
<EOS>
What
could
she
do
but
sob
?
<EOS>
She
sat
as
helpless
and
despairing
among
her
black
locks
as
Ajax
among
the
slaughtered
sheep
.
<EOS>
Very
trivial
,
perhaps
,
this
anguish
seems
to
weather
-
worn
mortals
who
have
to
think
of
Christmas
bills
,
dead
loves
,
and
broken
friendships
;
but
it
was
not
less
bitter
to
Maggie
 
<EOS>
perhaps
it
was
even
more
bitter
 
than
what
we
are
fond
of
calling
antithetically
the
real
troubles
of
mature
life
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
my
child
,
you
will
have
real
troubles
to
fret
about
by
and
by
,
"
is
the
consolation
we
have
almost
all
of
us
had
administered
to
us
in
our
childhood
,
and
have
repeated
to
other
children
since
we
have
been
grown
up
.
<EOS>
We
have
all
of
us
sobbed
so
piteously
,
standing
with
tiny
bare
legs
above
our
little
socks
,
when
we
lost
sight
of
our
mother
or
nurse
in
some
strange
place
;
but
we
can
no
longer
recall
the
poignancy
of
that
moment
and
weep
over
it
,
as
we
do
over
the
remembered
sufferings
of
five
or
ten
years
ago
.
<EOS>
Every
one
of
those
keen
moments
has
left
its
trace
,
and
lives
in
us
still
,
but
such
traces
have
blent
themselves
irrecoverably
with
the
firmer
texture
of
our
youth
and
manhood
;
and
so
it
comes
that
we
can
look
on
at
the
troubles
of
our
children
with
a
smiling
disbelief
in
the
reality
of
their
pain
.
<EOS>
Is
there
any
one
who
can
recover
the
experience
of
his
childhood
,
not
merely
with
a
memory
_
of
_
what
he
did
and
what
happened
to
him
,
of
what
he
liked
and
disliked
when
he
was
in
frock
and
trousers
,
but
with
an
intimate
penetration
,
a
revived
consciousness
of
what
he
felt
then
,
when
it
was
so
long
from
one
Midsummer
to
another
;
what
he
felt
when
his
school
fellows
shut
him
out
of
their
game
because
he
would
pitch
the
ball
wrong
out
of
mere
wilfulness
;
or
on
a
rainy
day
in
the
holidays
,
when
he
did
n't
know
how
to
amuse
himself
,
and
fell
from
idleness
into
mischief
,
from
mischief
into
defiance
,
and
from
defiance
into
sulkiness
;
or
when
his
mother
absolutely
refused
to
let
him
have
a
tailed
coat
<EOS>
that
"
half
,
"
although
every
other
boy
of
his
age
had
gone
into
tails
already
?
<EOS>
Surely
if
we
could
recall
that
early
bitterness
,
and
the
dim
guesses
,
the
strangely
perspectiveless
conception
of
life
,
that
gave
the
bitterness
its
intensity
,
we
should
not
pooh
-
pooh
<EOS>
the
griefs
of
our
children
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Maggie
,
you
're
to
come
down
this
minute
,
"
said
Kezia
,
entering
the
room
hurriedly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lawks
!
<EOS>
what
have
you
been
a
-
doing
?
<EOS>
I
never
_
see
_
such
a
fright
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
,
Kezia
,
"
said
Maggie
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
Go
away
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
tell
you
you
're
to
come
down
,
Miss
,
this
minute
;
your
mother
says
so
,
"
said
Kezia
,
going
up
to
Maggie
and
taking
her
by
the
hand
to
raise
her
from
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Get
away
,
Kezia
;
I
do
n't
want
any
dinner
,
"
said
Maggie
,
resisting
Kezia
's
arm
.
<EOS>
"
I
sha'n"t
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
well
,
I
ca
n't
stay
.
<EOS>
I
've
got
to
wait
at
dinner
,
"
said
Kezia
,
going
out
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
you
little
silly
,
"
said
Tom
,
peeping
into
the
room
ten
minutes
after
,
"
why
do
n't
you
come
and
have
your
dinner
?
<EOS>
There
's
lots
o
'
goodies
,
and
mother
says
you
're
to
come
.
<EOS>
What
are
you
crying
for
,
you
little
spooney
?
"
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
it
was
dreadful
!
<EOS>
Tom
was
so
hard
and
unconcerned
;
if
_
he
_
had
been
crying
on
the
floor
,
Maggie
would
have
cried
too
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
the
dinner
,
so
nice
;
and
she
was
_
<EOS>
so
_
hungry
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
bitter
.
  
<EOS>
But
Tom
was
not
altogether
hard
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
inclined
to
cry
,
and
did
not
feel
that
Maggie
's
grief
spoiled
his
prospect
of
the
sweets
;
but
he
went
and
put
his
head
near
her
,
and
said
in
a
lower
,
comforting
tone
,
    
"
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
come
,
then
,
Magsie
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
bring
you
a
bit
o
'
pudding
when
I
've
had
mine
,
and
a
custard
and
things
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ye
-
e
-
es
,
"
said
Maggie
,
beginning
to
feel
life
a
little
more
tolerable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
Tom
,
going
away
.
<EOS>
But
he
turned
again
at
the
door
and
said
,
"
But
you
'd
better
come
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
There
's
the
dessert
,
 
nuts
,
you

,
and
cowslip
wine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
tears
had
ceased
,
and
she
looked
reflective
as
Tom
left
her
.
<EOS>
His
good
nature
had
taken
off
the
keenest
edge
of
her
suffering
,
and
nuts
with
cowslip
wine
began
to
assert
their
legitimate
influence
.
  
<EOS>
Slowly
she
rose
from
amongst
her
scattered
locks
,
and
slowly
she
made
her
way
downstairs
.
<EOS>
Then
she
stood
leaning
with
one
shoulder
against
the
frame
of
the
dining
-
parlour
door
,
peeping
in
when
it
was
ajar
.
<EOS>
She
saw
Tom
and
Lucy
with
an
empty
chair
between
them
,
and
there
were
the
custards
on
a
side
-
table
;
it
was
too
much
.
<EOS>
She
slipped
in
and
went
toward
the
empty
chair
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
no
sooner
sat
down
than
she
repented
and
wished
herself
back
again
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
gave
a
little
scream
as
she
saw
her
,
and
felt
such
a
"
turn
"
that
she
dropped
the
large
gravy
-
spoon
into
the
dish
,
with
the
most
serious
results
to
the
table
-
cloth
.
<EOS>
For
Kezia
had
not
betrayed
the
reason
of
Maggie
's
refusal
to
come
down
,
not
liking
to
give
her
mistress
a
shock
in
the
moment
of
carving
,
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
thought
there
was
nothing
worse
in
question
than
a
fit
of
perverseness
,
which
was
inflicting
its
own
punishment
by
depriving
Maggie
of
half
her
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
scream
made
all
eyes
turn
towards
the
same
point
as
her
own
,
and
Maggie
's
cheeks
and
ears
began
to
burn
,
while
uncle
Glegg
,
a
kind
-
looking
,
white
-
haired
old
gentleman
,
said
,
    
"
Heyday
!
<EOS>
what
little
gell
's
this
?
<EOS>
Why
,
I
do
n't
know
her
.
<EOS>
Is
it
some
little
gell
you
've
picked
up
in
the
road
,
Kezia
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
she
's
gone
and
cut
her
hair
herself
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
in
an
undertone
to
Mr.
Deane
,
laughing
with
much
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
know
such
a
little
hussy
as
it
is
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
little
miss
,
you
've
made
yourself
look
very
funny
,
"
said
Uncle
Pullet
,
and
perhaps
he
never
in
his
life
made
an
observation
which
was
felt
to
be
so
lacerating
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fie
,
for
shame
!
<EOS>
"
said
aunt
Glegg
,
in
her
loudest
,
severest
tone
of
reproof
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Little
gells
as
cut
their
own
hair
should
be
whipped
and
fed
on
bread
and
water
,
 
not
come
and
sit
down
with
their
aunts
and
uncles
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
"
said
uncle
Glegg
,
meaning
to
give
a
playful
turn
to
this
denunciation
<EOS>
,
"
she
must
be
sent
to
jail
,
I
think
,
and
they
'll
cut
the
rest
of
her
hair
off
there
,
and
make
it
all
even
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
more
like
a
gypsy
nor
ever
,
"
said
aunt
Pullet
,
in
a
pitying
tone
;
"
it
's
very
bad
luck
,
sister
,
as
the
gell
should
be
so
brown
;
the
boy
's
fair
enough
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
'll
stand
in
her
way
i
'
life
to
be
so
brown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
naughty
child
,
as'll
break
her
mother
's
heart
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
seemed
to
be
listening
to
a
chorus
of
reproach
and
derision
.
<EOS>
Her
first
flush
came
from
anger
,
which
gave
her
a
transient
power
of
defiance
,
and
Tom
thought
she
was
braving
it
out
,
supported
by
the
recent
appearance
of
the
pudding
and
custard
.
<EOS>
Under
this
impression
,
he
whispered
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
!
<EOS>
Maggie
,
I
told
you
you
'd
catch
it
.
"
<EOS>
He
meant
to
be
friendly
,
but
Maggie
felt
convinced
that
Tom
was
rejoicing
in
her
ignominy
.
<EOS>
Her
feeble
power
of
defiance
left
her
in
an
instant
,
her
heart
swelled
,
and
getting
up
from
her
chair
,
she
ran
to
her
father
,
hid
her
face
on
his
shoulder
,
and
burst
out
into
loud
sobbing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
my
wench
,
"
said
her
father
,
soothingly
,
putting
his
arm
round
her
,
"
never
mind
<EOS>
;
you
was
i
'
the
right
to
cut
it
off
if
it
plagued
you
;
give
over
crying
;
father'll
take
your
part
.
"
  
<EOS>
Delicious
words
of
tenderness
!
<EOS>
Maggie
never
forgot
any
of
these
moments
when
her
father
"
took
her
part
"
;
she
kept
them
in
her
heart
,
and
thought
of
them
long
years
after
,
when
every
one
else
said
that
her
father
had
done
very
ill
by
his
children
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
your
husband
does
spoil
that
child
,
Bessy
!
"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
in
a
loud
"
aside
,
"
to
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
"
It
'll
be
the
ruin
of
her
,
if
you
do
n't
take
care
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
My
_
father
never
brought
his
children
up
so
,
else
we
should
ha
'
been
a
different
sort
o
'
family
to
what
we
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
domestic
sorrows
seemed
at
this
moment
to
have
reached
the
point
at
which
insensibility
begins
.
<EOS>
She
took
no
notice
of
her
sister
's
remark
,
but
threw
back
her
capstrings
and
dispensed
the
pudding
,
in
mute
resignation
.
  
<EOS>
With
the
dessert
there
came
entire
deliverance
for
Maggie
,
for
the
children
were
told
they
might
have
their
nuts
and
wine
in
the
summer
-
house
,
since
the
day
was
so
mild
;
and
they
scampered
out
among
the
budding
bushes
of
the
garden
with
the
alacrity
of
small
animals
getting
from
under
a
burning
glass
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
her
special
reason
for
this
permission
:
now
the
dinner
was
despatched
,
and
every
one
's
mind
disengaged
,
it
was
the
right
moment
to
communicate
Mr.
Tulliver
's
intention
concerning
Tom
,
and
it
would
be
as
well
for
Tom
himself
to
be
absent
.
<EOS>
The
children
were
used
to
hear
themselves
talked
of
as
freely
as
if
they
were
birds
,
and
could
understand
nothing
,
however
they
might
stretch
their
necks
and
listen
;
but
on
this
occasion
Mrs.
Tulliver
manifested
an
unusual
discretion
,
because
she
had
recently
had
evidence
that
the
going
to
school
to
a
clergyman
was
a
sore
point
with
Tom
,
who
looked
at
it
as
very
much
on
a
par
with
going
to
school
to
a
constable
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
a
sighing
sense
that
her
husband
would
do
as
he
liked
,
whatever
sister
Glegg
said
,
or
sister
Pullet
either
;
but
at
least
they
would
not
be
able
to
say
,
if
the
thing
turned
out
ill
,
that
Bessy
had
fallen
in
with
her
husband
's
folly
without
letting
her
own
friends
know
a
word
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Tulliver
,
"
she
said
,
interrupting
her
husband
in
his
talk
with
Mr.
Deane
,
"
it
's
time
now
to
tell
the
children
's
aunts
and
uncles
what
you
're
thinking
of
doing
with
Tom
,
is
n't
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
well
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
rather
sharply
,
"
I
've
no
objections
to
tell
anybody
what
I
mean
to
do
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
've
settled
,
"
he
added
,
looking
toward
Mr.
Glegg
and
Mr.
Deane
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
settled
to
send
him
to
a
Mr.
Stelling
,
a
parson
,
down
at
King
's
Lorton
,
there
,
 
an
uncommon
clever
fellow
<EOS>
,
I
understand
,
as'll
put
him
up
to
most
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
rustling
demonstration
of
surprise
in
the
company
,
such
as
you
may
have
observed
in
a
country
congregation
when
they
hear
an
allusion
to
their
week
-
day
affairs
from
the
pulpit
.
<EOS>
It
was
equally
astonishing
to
the
aunts
and
uncles
to
find
a
parson
introduced
into
Mr.
Tulliver
's
family
arrangements
.
<EOS>
As
for
uncle
Pullet
,
he
could
hardly
have
been
more
thoroughly
obfuscated
if
Mr.
Tulliver
had
said
that
he
was
going
to
send
Tom
to
the
Lord
Chancellor
;
for
uncle
Pullet
belonged
to
that
extinct
class
of
British
yeoman
who
,
dressed
in
good
broadcloth
,
paid
high
rates
and
taxes
,
went
to
church
,
and
ate
a
particularly
good
dinner
on
Sunday
,
without
dreaming
that
the
British
constitution
in
Church
and
State
had
a
traceable
origin
any
more
than
the
solar
system
and
the
fixed
stars
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
melancholy
,
but
true
,
that
Mr.
Pullet
had
the
most
confused
idea
of
a
bishop
as
a
sort
of
a
baronet
,
who
might
or
might
not
be
a
clergyman
;
and
as
the
rector
of
his
own
parish
was
a
man
of
high
family
and
fortune
,
the
idea
that
a
clergyman
could
be
a
schoolmaster
was
too
remote
from
Mr.
Pullet
's
experience
to
be
readily
conceivable
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
is
difficult
for
people
in
these
instructed
times
to
believe
in
uncle
Pullet
's
ignorance
;
but
let
them
reflect
on
the
remarkable
results
of
a
great
natural
faculty
under
favoring
circumstances
.
<EOS>
And
uncle
Pullet
had
a
great
natural
faculty
for
ignorance
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
first
to
give
utterance
to
his
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
can
you
be
going
to
send
him
to
a
parson
for
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
with
an
amazed
twinkling
in
his
eyes
,
looking
at
Mr.
Glegg
and
Mr.
Deane
,
to
see
if
they
showed
any
signs
of
comprehension
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
because
the
parsons
are
the
best
schoolmasters
,
by
what
I
can
make
out
,
"
said
poor
Mr.
Tulliver
,
who
,
in
the
maze
of
this
puzzling
world
,
laid
hold
of
any
clue
with
great
readiness
and
tenacity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Jacobs
at
th
'
academy
's
no
parson
,
and
he
's
done
very
bad
by
the
boy
;
and
I
made
up
my
mind
,
if
I
send
him
to
school
again
,
it
should
be
to
somebody
different
to
Jacobs
.
<EOS>
And
this
Mr.
Stelling
,
by
what
I
can
make
out
,
is
the
sort
<EOS>
o
'
man
I
want
.
<EOS>
And
I
mean
my
boy
to
go
to
him
at
Midsummer
,
"
he
concluded
,
in
a
tone
of
decision
,
tapping
his
snuff
-
box
and
taking
a
pinch
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
have
to
pay
a
swinging
half
-
yearly
bill
,
then
,
eh
,
Tulliver
?
<EOS>
The
clergymen
have
highish
notions
,
in
general
,
"
said
Mr.
Deane
,
taking
snuff
vigorously
,
as
he
always
did
when
wishing
to
maintain
a
neutral
position
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
do
you
think
the
parson'll
teach
him
to
know
a
good
sample
o
'
wheat
when
he
sees
it
,
neighbor
Tulliver
?
"
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
who
was
fond
of
his
jest
,
and
having
retired
from
business
,
felt
that
it
was
not
only
allowable
but
becoming
in
him
to
take
a
playful
view
of
things
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
see
,
I
've
got
a
plan
<EOS>
i
'
my
head
about
Tom
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
pausing
after
that
statement
and
lifting
up
his
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
I
may
be
allowed
to
speak
,
and
it
's
seldom
as
I
am
,
"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
with
a
tone
of
bitter
meaning
,
"
I
should
like
to
know
what
good
is
to
come
to
the
boy
by
bringin
'
him
up
above
his
fortin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
not
looking
at
Mrs.
Glegg
,
but
at
the
male
part
of
his
audience
,
"
you
see
,
I
've
made
up
my
mind
not
to
bring
Tom
up
to
my
own
business
.
<EOS>
I
've
had
my
thoughts
about
it
all
along
,
and
I
made
up
my
mind
by
what
I
saw
with
Garnett
and
_
his
_
son
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
put
him
to
some
business
as
he
can
go
into
without
capital
,
and
I
want
to
give
him
an
eddication
as
he
'll
be
even
wi
'
the
lawyers
and
folks
,
and
put
me
up
to
a
notion
now
an
'
then

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
emitted
a
long
sort
of
guttural
sound
with
closed
lips
,
that
smiled
in
mingled
pity
and
scorn
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
'
ud
be
a
fine
deal
better
for
some
people
,
"
she
said
,
after
that
introductory
note
,
"
if
they
'd
let
the
lawyers
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
at
the
head
of
a
grammar
school
,
then
,
this
clergyman
,
such
as
that
at
Market
Bewley
?
"
said
Mr.
Deane
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
nothing
of
that
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
"
He
wo
n't
take
more
than
two
or
three
pupils

to
attend
to
'em

you
know

"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
and
get
his
eddication
done
the
sooner

they
ca
n't
learn
much
at
a
time
when
there
's
so
many
of
'
em

said
uncle
Pullet
,
feeling
that
he
was
getting
quite
an
insight
into
this
difficult
matter
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
'll
want
the
more
pay
,
I
doubt

said
Mr.
Glegg
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay

a
cool
hundred
a
year

that
's
all

said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
with
some
pride
at
his
own
spirited
course
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
then
,
you
know
,
it
's
an
investment
;
Tom
's
eddication
"
ull
be
so
much
capital
to
him

<EOS>
"
Ay

there
's
something
in

said
Mr.
Glegg

Well
well

I
remember

those
two
lines
wrote
on

at

Mr.

rubbed
his

looked
very
pleasant

Mr.
Glegg
,
I
wonder
_
at
_
you
,
"
said
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
unbecoming
in
a
man
<EOS>
o

your
age
and
belongings

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
unbecoming
,
Mrs.
G.
?
"
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
winking
pleasantly
at
the
company
.
<EOS>
"
My
new
blue
coat
as
I
've
got
on

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
pity
your
weakness
,
Mr.
Glegg
.
<EOS>
I
say
it
's
unbecoming
to
be
making
a
joke
when
you
see
your
own
kin
going
headlongs
to
ruin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
mean
me
by
that
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
considerably
nettled
,
"
you
need
n't
trouble
yourself
to
fret
about
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
manage
my
own
affairs
without
troubling
other
folks
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Bless
me
!
"
said
Mr.
Deane
,
judiciously
introducing
a
new
idea
,
<EOS>
"
why
,
now
I
come
to
think
of
it
,
somebody
said
Wakem
was
going
to
send
_
his
_
son
 
<EOS>
the
deformed
lad
 
to
a

n't
they
,
Susan

"
<EOS>
(
appealing
to
his
wife
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
give
no
account
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
said
Mrs.
Deane
,
closing
her
lips
very
tightly
again
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Deane
was
not
a
woman
to
take
part
in
a
scene
where
missiles
were
flying
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
speaking
all
the
more
cheerfully
,
that
Mrs.
Glegg
might
see
he
did
n't
mind
her
,
"
if
Wakem
thinks
o
'
sending
his
son
to
a
clergyman
,
depend
on
it
<EOS>
I
shall
make
no
mistake
<EOS>
i

sending
Tom

<EOS>
Wakem
's
as
big
a
scoundrel
as
Old
Harry

he
knows
the
length

Ay

ay

tell
me

I
'll
tell
you
where
to
get
your

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
lawyer
Wakem
's
son

got
a
hump
-
back

"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
who
felt
as
if
the
whole
business
had
a
funereal
aspect
;
"
it
's
more
nat'ral

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
interpreting
Mrs.
Pullet
's
observation
with
erroneous
plausibility
,
"
you
must
consider
that

Wakem

<EOS>
"
Mr.

said
Mrs.
G.

in
a
tone
which
implied
that
her
indignation
would
fizz
and
ooze
a
little
,
though
she
was
determined
to
keep
it
corked
up
,
"
you

better
hold
your

<EOS>
Mr.

"
Why

said
Mr.

beginning
to
boil
up
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
_
<EOS>

"
said
Mrs.

,
sarcastically
.
<EOS>
"
My

<EOS>
"
It

Mr.

"
Come

said
Mr.

soothingly
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.

was
not

of
his
retort
.
  
<EOS>
"
You

a

<EOS>
"
Bessy

said
Mrs.

,
very
much
with
the
feeling
of
a
cur
that
seizes
the
opportunity
of
diverting
his
bark
toward
the
man
who
carries
no
stick
.
<EOS>
"
It

almonds

<EOS>
"
  
"
Lors

sister
Glegg
,
do
n't
be
so
quarrelsome
,
"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
beginning
to
cry
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
struck
with
a

getting

just

very

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
it
_

_
bad

said
Mrs.

.
<EOS>
"
Things

a

But
while
he
was
speaking
,
Mr.

,
who
had
by
no
means
said
enough
to
satisfy
his
anger
,
burst
out
again

<EOS>

Who

he
said
.
<EOS>
"
It

<EOS>
_
I

should
never

if
she
kept
her
place

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
place

"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
getting
rather
more
shrill
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
your
betters

Mr.
Tulliver
,
as
are
dead

in

Mrs.

rising
from

"
Dear

said
Mr.

in
a
melancholy
tone
,
as
he
followed
his
wife
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Tulliver
,
how
could
you
talk
so

said
Mrs.

,
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
her
go

"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
too
hot
to
be
damped
by
any
amount
of
tears
.
<EOS>
"
Let

go

"
  
<EOS>
"
Sister
Pullet

said
Mrs.

,
helplessly
,
"
do
you
think
it
'

be
any
use
for
you
to
go
after

and
try

<EOS>
"
  
"
Better

better

said
Mr.
Deane
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
make
it
up
another
day

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
sisters
,
shall
we
go
and
look
at
the
children
?
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
drying
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
No
proposition
could
have
been
more
seasonable
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
felt
very
much
as
if
the
air
had
been
cleared
of
obtrusive
flies
now
the
women
were
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
There
were
few
things
he
liked
better
than
a
chat
with
Mr.
Deane
,
whose
close
application
to
business
allowed
the
pleasure
very
rarely
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
,
he
considered
,
was
the
"
knowingest
"
man
of
his
acquaintance
,
and
he
had
besides
a
ready
causticity
of
tongue
that
made
an
agreeable
supplement
to
Mr.
Tulliver
's
own
tendency
that
way
,
which
had
remained
in
rather
an
inarticulate
condition
.
<EOS>
And
now
the
women
were
gone
,
they
could
carry
on
their
serious
talk
without
frivolous
interruption
.
<EOS>
They
could
exchange
their
views
concerning
the
Duke
of
Wellington
,
whose
conduct
in
the
Catholic
Question
had
thrown
such
an
entirely
new
light
on
his
character
;
and
speak
slightingly
of
his
conduct
at
the
battle
of
Waterloo
,
which
he
would
never
have
won
if
there
had
n't
been
a
great
many
Englishmen
at
his
back
,
not
to
speak
of
Blucher
and
the
Prussians
,
who
,
as
Mr.
Tulliver
had
heard
from
a
person
of
particular
knowledge
in
that
matter
,
had
come
up
in
the
very
nick
of
time
;
though
here
there
was
a
slight
dissidence
,
Mr.
Deane
remarking
that
he
was
not
disposed
to
give
much
credit
to
the
Prussians
,
 
the
build
of
their
vessels
,
together
with
the
unsatisfactory
character
of
transactions
in
Dantzic
beer
,
inclining
him
to
form
rather
a
low
view
of
Prussian
pluck
generally
.
<EOS>
Rather
beaten
on
this
ground
,
Mr.
Tulliver
proceeded
to
express
his
fears
that
the
country
could
never
again
be
what
it
used
to
be
;
but
Mr.
Deane
,
attached
to
a
firm
of
which
the
returns
were
on
the
increase
,
naturally
took
a
more
lively
view
of
the
present
,
and
had
some
details
to
give
concerning
the
state
of
the
imports
,
especially
in
hides
and
spelter
,
which
soothed
Mr.
Tulliver
's
imagination
by
throwing
into
more
distant
perspective
the
period
when
the
country
would
become
utterly
the
prey
of
Papists
and
Radicals
,
and
there
would
be
no
more
chance
for
honest
men
.
  
<EOS>
Uncle
Pullet
sat
by
and
listened
with
twinkling
eyes
to
these
high
matters
.
<EOS>
He
did
n't
understand
politics
himself
,
 
thought
they
were
a
natural
gift
,
 
<EOS>
but
by
what
he
could
make
out
,
this
Duke
of
Wellington
was
no
better
than
he
should
be
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
Shows
His
Weaker
Side
  
"
<EOS>
Suppose
sister
Glegg
should
call
her
money
in
;
it
'
ud
be
very
awkward
for
you
to
have
to
raise
five
hundred
pounds
now
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
to
her
husband
that
evening
,
as
she
took
a
plaintive
review
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
lived
thirteen
years
with
her
husband
,
yet
she
retained
in
all
the
freshness
of
her
early
married
life
a
facility
of
saying
things
which
drove
him
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
one
she
desired
.
<EOS>
Some
minds
are
wonderful
for
keeping
their
bloom
in
this
way
,
as
a
patriarchal
goldfish
apparently
retains
to
the
last
its
youthful
illusion
that
it
can
swim
in
a
straight
line
beyond
the
encircling
glass
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
an
amiable
fish
of
this
kind
,
and
after
running
her
head
against
the
same
resisting
medium
for
thirteen
years
would
go
at
it
again
to
-
day
with
undulled
alacrity
.
  
<EOS>
This
observation
of
hers
tended
directly
to
convince
Mr.
Tulliver
that
it
would
not
be
at
all
awkward
for
him
to
raise
five
hundred
pounds
;
and
when
Mrs.
Tulliver
became
rather
pressing
to
know
_
<EOS>
how
_
he
would
raise
it
without
mortgaging
the
mill
and
the
house
which
he
had
said
he
never
_
would
<EOS>
_
mortgage
,
since
nowadays
people
were
none
so
ready
to
lend
money
without
security
,
Mr.
Tulliver
,
getting
warm
,
declared
that
Mrs.
Glegg
might
do
as
she
liked
about
calling
in
her
money
,
he
should
pay
it
in
whether
or
not
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
going
to
be
beholden
to
his
wife
's
sisters
.
<EOS>
When
a
man
had
married
into
a
family
where
there
was
a
whole
litter
of
women
,
he
might
have
plenty
to
put
up
with
if
he
chose
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Tulliver
did
_
not
_
choose
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
cried
a
little
in
a
trickling
,
quiet
way
as
she
put
on
her
nightcap
;
but
presently
sank
into
a
comfortable
sleep
,
lulled
by
the
thought
that
she
would
talk
everything
over
with
her
sister
Pullet
to
-
morrow
,
when
she
was
to
take
the
children
to
Garum
Firs
to
tea
.
<EOS>
Not
that
she
looked
forward
to
any
distinct
issue
from
that
talk
;
but
it
seemed
impossible
that
past
events
should
be
so
obstinate
as
to
remain
unmodified
when
they
were
complained
against
.
  
<EOS>
Her
husband
lay
awake
rather
longer
,
for
he
too
was
thinking
of
a
visit
he
would
pay
on
the
morrow
;
and
his
ideas
on
the
subject
were
not
of
so
vague
and
soothing
a
kind
as
those
of
his
amiable
partner
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
,
when
under
the
influence
of
a
strong
feeling
,
had
a
promptitude
in
action
that
may
seem
inconsistent
with
that
painful
sense
of
the
complicated
,
puzzling
nature
of
human
affairs
under
which
his
more
dispassionate
deliberations
were
conducted
;
but
it
is
really
not
improbable
that
there
was
a
direct
relation
between
these
apparently
contradictory
phenomena
,
since
I
have
observed
that
for
getting
a
strong
impression
that
a
skein
is
tangled
there
is
nothing
like
snatching
hastily
at
a
single
thread
.
<EOS>
It
was
owing
to
this
promptitude
that
Mr.
Tulliver
was
on
horseback
soon
after
dinner
the
next
day
(
he
was
not
dyspeptic
)
on
his
way
to
Basset
to
see
his
sister
Moss
and
her
husband
.
<EOS>
For
having
made
up
his
mind
irrevocably
that
he
would
pay
Mrs.
Glegg
her
loan
of
five
hundred
pounds
,
it
naturally
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
a
promissory
note
for
three
hundred
pounds
lent
to
his
brother
-
in
-
law
Moss
;
and
if
the
said
brother
-
in
-
law
could
manage
to
pay
in
the
money
within
a
given
time
,
it
would
go
far
to
lessen
the
fallacious
air
of
inconvenience
which
Mr.
Tulliver
's
spirited
step
might
have
worn
in
the
eyes
of
weak
people
who
require
to
know
precisely
_
how
_
a
thing
is
to
be
done
before
they
are
strongly
confident
that
it
will
be
easy
.
  
<EOS>
For
Mr.
Tulliver
was
in
a
position
neither
new
nor
striking
,
but
,
like
other
every
-
day
things
,
sure
to
have
a
cumulative
effect
that
will
be
felt
in
the
long
run
:
he
was
held
to
be
a
much
more
substantial
man
than
he
really
was
.
<EOS>
And
as
we
are
all
apt
to
believe
what
the
world
believes
about
us
,
it
was
his
habit
to
think
of
failure
and
ruin
with
the
same
sort
of
remote
pity
with
which
a
spare
,
long
-
necked
man
hears
that
his
plethoric
short
-
necked
neighbor
is
stricken
with
apoplexy
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
always
used
to
hear
pleasant
jokes
about
his
advantages
as
a
man
who
worked
his
own
mill
,
and
owned
a
pretty
bit
of
land
;
and
these
jokes
naturally
kept
up
his
sense
that
he
was
a
man
of
considerable
substance
.
<EOS>
They
gave
a
pleasant
flavor
to
his
glass
on
a
market
-
day
,
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
recurrence
of
half
-
yearly
payments
,
Mr.
Tulliver
would
really
have
forgotten
that
there
was
a
mortgage
of
two
thousand
pounds
on
his
very
desirable
freehold
.
<EOS>
That
was
not
altogether
his
own
fault
,
since
one
of
the
thousand
pounds
was
his
sister
's
fortune
,
which
he
had
to
pay
on
her
marriage
;
and
a
man
who
has
neighbors
that
_
will
_
go
to
law
with
him
is
not
likely
to
pay
off
his
mortgages
,
especially
if
he
enjoys
the
good
opinion
of
acquaintances
who
want
to
borrow
a
hundred
pounds
on
security
too
lofty
to
be
represented
by
parchment
.
<EOS>
Our
friend
Mr.
Tulliver
had
a
good
-
natured
fibre
in
him
,
and
did
not
like
to
give
harsh
refusals
even
to
his
sister
,
who
had
not
only
come
in
to
the
world
in
that
superfluous
way
characteristic
of
sisters
,
creating
a
necessity
for
mortgages
,
but
had
quite
thrown
herself
away
in
marriage
,
and
had
crowned
her
mistakes
by
having
an
eighth
baby
.
<EOS>
On
this
point
Mr.
Tulliver
was
conscious
of
being
a
little
weak
;
but
he
apologized
to
himself
by
saying
that
poor
Gritty
had
been
a
good
-
looking
wench
before
she
married
Moss
;
he
would
sometimes
say
this
even
with
a
slight
tremulousness
in
his
voice
.
<EOS>
But
this
morning
he
was
in
a
mood
more
becoming
a
man
of
business
,
and
in
the
course
of
his
ride
along
the
Basset
lanes
,
with
their
deep
ruts
,
 
lying
so
far
away
from
a
market
-
town
that
the
labor
of
drawing
produce
and
manure
was
enough
to
take
away
the
best
part
of
the
profits
on
such
poor
land
as
that
parish
was
made
of
,
 
he
got
up
a
due
amount
of
irritation
against
Moss
as
a
man
without
capital
,
who
,
if
murrain
and
blight
were
abroad
,
was
sure
to
have
his
share
of
them
,
and
who
,
the
more
you
tried
to
help
him
out
of
the
mud
,
would
sink
the
further
in
.
<EOS>
It
would
do
him
good
rather
than
harm
,
now
,
if
he
were
obliged
to
raise
this
three
hundred
pounds
;
it
would
make
him
look
about
him
better
,
and
not
act
so
foolishly
about
his
wool
this
year
as
he
did
the
last
;
in
fact
,
Mr.
Tulliver
had
been
too
easy
with
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
and
because
he
had
let
the
interest
run
on
for
two
years
,
Moss
was
likely
enough
to
think
that
he
should
never
be
troubled
about
the
principal
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Tulliver
was
determined
not
to
encourage
such
shuffling
people
any
longer
;
and
a
ride
along
the
Basset
lanes
was
not
likely
to
enervate
a
man
's
resolution
by
softening
his
temper
.
<EOS>
The
deep
-
trodden
hoof
-
marks
,
made
in
the
muddiest
days
of
winter
,
gave
him
a
shake
now
and
then
which
suggested
a
rash
but
stimulating
snarl
at
the
father
of
lawyers
,
who
,
whether
by
means
of
his
hoof
or
otherwise
,
had
doubtless
something
to
do
with
this
state
of
the
roads
;
and
the
abundance
of
foul
land
and
neglected
fences
that
met
his
eye
,
though
they
made
no
part
of
his
brother
Moss
's
farm
,
strongly
contributed
to
his
dissatisfaction
with
that
unlucky
agriculturist
.
<EOS>
If
this
was
n't
Moss
's
fallow
,
it
might
have
been
;
Basset
was
all
alike
;
it
was
a
beggarly
parish
,
in
Mr.
Tulliver
's
opinion
,
and
his
opinion
was
certainly
not
groundless
.
<EOS>
Basset
had
a
poor
soil
,
poor
roads
,
a
poor
non
-
resident
landlord
,
a
poor
non
-
resident
vicar
,
and
rather
less
than
half
a
curate
,
also
poor
.
<EOS>
If
any
one
strongly
impressed
with
the
power
of
the
human
mind
to
triumph
over
circumstances
will
contend
that
the
parishioners
of
Basset
might
nevertheless
have
been
a
very
superior
class
of
people
<EOS>
,
I
have
nothing
to
urge
against
that
abstract
proposition
;
I
only
know
that
,
in
point
of
fact
,
the
Basset
mind
was
in
strict
keeping
with
its
circumstances
.
<EOS>
The
muddy
lanes
,
green
or
clayey
,
that
seemed
to
the
unaccustomed
eye
to
lead
nowhere
<EOS>
but
into
each
other
,
did
really
lead
,
with
patience
,
to
a
distant
high
-
road
;
but
there
were
many
feet
in
Basset
which
they
led
more
frequently
to
a
centre
of
dissipation
,
spoken
of
formerly
as
the
"
Markis
o
'
Granby
,
"
but
among
intimates
as
"
Dickison
's
.
"
<EOS>
A
large
low
room
with
a
sanded
floor
;
a
cold
scent
of
tobacco
,
modified
by
undetected
beer
-
dregs
;
Mr.
Dickison
leaning
against
the
door
-
post
with
a
melancholy
pimpled
face
,
looking
as
irrelevant
to
the
daylight
as
a
last
night
's
guttered
candle
,
 
all
this
may
not
seem
a
very
seductive
form
of
temptation
;
but
the
majority
of
men
in
Basset
found
it
fatally
alluring
when
encountered
on
their
road
toward
four
o'clock
on
a
wintry
afternoon
;
and
if
any
wife
in
Basset
wished
to
indicate
that
her
husband
was
not
a
pleasure
-
seeking
man
,
she
could
hardly
do
it
more
emphatically
than
by
saying
that
he
did
n't
spend
a
shilling
at
Dickison
's
from
one
Whitsuntide
to
another
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Moss
had
said
so
of
_
her
_
husband
more
than
once
,
when
her
brother
was
in
a
mood
to
find
fault
with
him
,
as
he
certainly
was
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
And
nothing
could
be
less
pacifying
to
Mr.
Tulliver
than
the
behavior
of
the
farmyard
gate
,
which
he
no
sooner
attempted
to
push
open
with
his
riding
-
stick
than
it
acted
as
gates
without
the
upper
hinge
are
known
to
do
,
to
the
peril
of
shins
,
whether
equine
or
human
.
<EOS>
He
was
about
to
get
down
and
lead
his
horse
through
the
damp
dirt
of
the
hollow
farmyard
,
shadowed
drearily
by
the
large
half
-
timbered
buildings
,
up
to
the
long
line
of
tumble
-
down
dwelling
-
houses
standing
on
a
raised
causeway
;
but
the
timely
appearance
of
a
cowboy
saved
him
that
frustration
of
a
plan
he
had
determined
on
,
 
namely
,
not
to
get
down
from
his
horse
during
this
visit
.
<EOS>
If
a
man
means
to
be
hard
,
let
him
keep
in
his
saddle
and
speak
from
that
height
,
above
the
level
of
pleading
eyes
,
and
with
the
command
of
a
distant
horizon
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Moss
heard
the
sound
of
the
horse
's
feet
,
and
,
when
her
brother
rode
up
,
was
already
outside
the
kitchen
door
,
with
a
half
-
weary
smile
on
her
face
,
and
a
black
-
eyed
baby
in
her
arms
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Moss
's
face
bore
a
faded
resemblance
to
her
brother
's
;
baby
's
little
fat
hand
,
pressed
against
her
cheek
,
seemed
to
show
more
strikingly
that
the
cheek
was
faded
.
  
<EOS>
"
Brother
,
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
,
"
she
said
,
in
an
affectionate
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
look
for
you
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
pretty
well
,
Mrs.
Moss
,
pretty
well
,
"
answered
the
brother
,
with
cool
deliberation
,
as
if
it
were
rather
too
forward
of
her
to
ask
that
question
.
<EOS>
She
knew
at
once
that
her
brother
was
not
in
a
good
humor
;
he
never
called
her
Mrs.
Moss
except
when
he
was
angry
,
and
when
they
were
in
company
.
<EOS>
But
she
thought
it
was
in
the
order
of
nature
that
people
who
were
poorly
off
should
be
snubbed
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Moss
did
not
take
her
stand
on
the
equality
of
the
human
race
;
she
was
a
patient
,
prolific
,
loving
-
hearted
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
husband
is
n't
in
the
house
,
I
suppose
?
"
added
Mr.
Tulliver
after
a
grave
pause
,
during
which
four
children
had
run
out
,
like
chickens
whose
mother
has
been
suddenly
in
eclipse
behind
the
hen
-
coop
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mrs.
Moss
,
"
but
he
's
only
in
the
potato
-
field
yonders
.
<EOS>
Georgy
,
run
to
the
Far
Close
in
a
minute
,
and
tell
father
your
uncle

<EOS>
You
'll
get
down
,
brother
,
wo

you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No

no
;
I
ca
n't
get
down
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
going
home
again
directly
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
looking
at
the
distance
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
's
Mrs.
Tulliver
and
the
children
?
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs.
Moss
,
humbly
,
not
daring
to
press
her
invitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
pretty
well
.
<EOS>
Tom
's
going
to
a
new
school
at
Midsummer
,
 
a
deal
of
expense
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
's
bad
work
for
me
,
lying
out
o
'
my
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
'd
be
so
good
as
let
the
children
come
and
see
their
cousins
some
day
.
<EOS>
My
little
uns
want
to
see
their
cousin
Maggie
so
as
never
was
.
<EOS>
And
me
her
godmother
,
and
so
fond
of
her
;
there
's
nobody
'
<EOS>
ud
make
a
bigger
fuss
with
her
,
according
to
what
they
've
got
.
<EOS>
And
I
know
she
likes
to
come
,
for
she
's
a
loving
child
,
and
how
quick
and
clever
she
is
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
Mrs.
Moss
had
been
one
of
the
most
astute
women
in
the
world
,
instead
of
being
one
of
the
simplest
,
she
could
have
thought
of
nothing
more
likely
to
propitiate
her
brother
than
this
praise
of
Maggie
.
<EOS>
He
seldom
found
any
one
volunteering
praise
of
"
the
little
wench
"
;
it
was
usually
left
entirely
to
himself
to
insist
on
her
merits
.
<EOS>
But
Maggie
always
appeared
in
the
most
amiable
light
at
her
aunt
Moss
's
;
it
was
her
Alsatia
,
where
she
was
out
of
the
reach
of
law
,
 
if
she
upset
anything
,
dirtied
her
shoes
,
or
tore
her
frock
,
these
things
were
matters
of
course
at
her
aunt
Moss
's
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
himself
,
Mr.
Tulliver
's
eyes
got
milder
,
and
he
did
not
look
away
from
his
sister
as
he
said
,
    
"
<EOS>
Ay
;
she
's
fonder
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
you
than
o
'
the
other
aunts
<EOS>
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
She
takes
after
our
family
:
not
a
bit
of
her
mother
's
in
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Moss
says
she
's
just
like
what
I
used
to
be
,
"
said
Mrs.
Moss
,
"
though
I
was
never
so
quick
and
fond
<EOS>
o
'
the
books

<EOS>
But
I
think
my
Lizzy
's
like
her
;
_
<EOS>
she
's
_
sharp

<EOS>
Come
here
,
Lizzy
,
my
dear
,
and
let
your
uncle
see
you
;
he
hardly
knows
you
,
you
grow
so
fast
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzy
,
a
black
-
eyed
child
of
seven
,
looked
very
shy
when
her
mother
drew
her
forward
,
for
the
small
Mosses
were
much
in
awe
of
their
uncle
from
Dorlcote
Mill
.
<EOS>
She
was
inferior
enough
to
Maggie
in
fire
and
strength
of
expression
to
make
the
resemblance
between
the
two
entirely
flattering
to
Mr.
Tulliver
's
fatherly
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
they
're
a
bit
alike
,
"
he
said
,
looking
kindly
at
the
little
figure
in
the
soiled
pinafore
.
<EOS>
"
They
both
take
after
our
mother
.
<EOS>
You
've
got
enough
o
'
gells
,
Gritty

"
he
added
,
in
a
tone
half
compassionate
,
half
reproachful
.
  
<EOS>
"
Four
of
'em
,
bless
'
em
!
"
said
Mrs.
Moss
,
with
a
sigh
,
stroking
Lizzy
's
hair
on
each
side
of
her
forehead
;
"
as
many
as
there
's
boys
.
<EOS>
They
've
got
a
brother
apiece
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
but
they
must
turn
out
and
fend
for
themselves
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
feeling
that
his
severity
was
relaxing
and
trying
to
brace
it
by
throwing
out
a
wholesome
hint
<EOS>
"
They
must
n't
look
to
hanging
on
their
brothers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
<EOS>
but
I
hope
their
brothers
"
ull
love
the
poor
things
,
and
remember
they
came
o
'
one
father
and
mother
;
the
lads
"
ull
never
be
the
poorer
for
that
,
"
said
Mrs.
Moss
,
flashing
out
with
hurried
timidity
,
like
a
half
-
smothered
fire
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
gave
his
horse
a
little
stroke
on
the
flank
,
then
checked
it
,
and
said
angrily
,
"
Stand
still
with
you
!
"
<EOS>
much
to
the
astonishment
of
that
innocent
animal
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
the
more
there
is
of
'em
,
the
more
they
must
love
one
another
,
"
Mrs.
Moss
went
on
,
looking
at
her
children
with
a
didactic
purpose
.
<EOS>
But
she
turned
toward
her
brother
again
to
say
,
"
Not
but
what
I
hope
your
boy
"
ull
allays
be
good
to
his
sister
,
though
there
's
but
two
of
'em
,
like
you
and
me
,
brother
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
arrow
went
straight
to
Mr.
Tulliver
's
heart
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
a
rapid
imagination
,
but
the
thought
of
Maggie
was
very
near
to
him
,
and
he
was
not
long
in
seeing
his
relation
to
his
own
sister
side
by
side
with
Tom
's
relation
to
Maggie
.
<EOS>
Would
the
little
wench
ever
be
poorly
off
,
and
Tom
rather
hard
upon
her
?
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
Gritty
,
"
said
the
miller
,
with
a
new
softness
in
his
tone
;
"
but
I
've
allays
done
what
I
could
for
you
,
"
he
added
,
as
if
vindicating
himself
from
a
reproach
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
denying
that
,
brother
,
and
I
'm
noways
ungrateful
,
"
said
poor
Mrs.
Moss
,
too
fagged
by
toil
and
children
to
have
strength
left
for
any
pride
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
here
's
the
father
.
<EOS>
What
a
while
you
've
been
,
Moss
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
While
,
do
you
call
it
?
"
said
Mr.
Moss
,
feeling
out
of
breath
and
injured
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
running
all
the
way
.
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
"
light
,
Mr.
Tulliver
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'll
just
get
down
and
have
a
bit
<EOS>
o
'
talk
with
you
in
the
garden
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
thinking
that
he
should
be
more
likely
to
show
a
due
spirit
of
resolve
if
his
sister
were
not
present
.
  
<EOS>
He
got
down
,
and
passed
with
Mr.
Moss
into
the
garden
,
toward
an
old
yew
-
tree
arbor
,
while
his
sister
stood
tapping
her
baby
on
the
back
and
looking
wistfully
after
them
.
  
<EOS>
Their
entrance
into
the
yew
-
tree
arbor
surprised
several
fowls
that
were
recreating
themselves
by
scratching
deep
holes
in
the
dusty
ground
,
and
at
once
took
flight
with
much
pother
and
cackling
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
sat
down
on
the
bench
,
and
tapping
the
ground
curiously
here
and
there
with
his
stick
,
as
if
he
suspected
some
hollowness
,
opened
the
conversation
by
observing
,
with
something
like
a
snarl
in
his
tone
,
    
"
Why
,
you
've
got
wheat
again
in
that
Corner
Close
,
I
see
;
and
never
a
bit
o
'
dressing
on
it
.
<EOS>
You
'll
do
no
good
with
it
this
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Moss
,
who
,
when
he
married
Miss
Tulliver
,
had
been
regarded
as
the
buck
of
Basset
,
now
wore
a
beard
nearly
a
week
old
,
and
had
the
depressed
,
unexpectant
air
of
a
machine
-
horse
.
<EOS>
He
answered
in
a
patient
-
grumbling
tone
,
"
Why
,
poor
farmers
like
me
must
do
as
they
can
;
they
must
leave
it
to
them
as
have
got
money
to
play
with
,
to
put
half
as
much
into
the
ground
as
they
mean
to
get
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
who
should
have
money
to
play
with
,
if
it
is
n't
them
as
can
borrow
money
without
paying
interest
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
who
wished
to
get
into
a
slight
quarrel
;
it
was
the
most
natural
and
easy
introduction
to
calling
in
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
'm
behind
with
the
interest
,
"
said
Mr.
Moss
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
was
so
unlucky
<EOS>
wi
'
the
wool
last
year
;
and
what
with
the
Missis
being
laid
up
so
,
things
have
gone
awk'arder
nor

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay

"
snarled
Mr.
Tulliver
,
"
there
's
folks
as

ull

empty

"
ull

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well

I
do
n't
know
what
fault
you
've
got
to
find
wi

me
,
Mr.
Tulliver
,
"
said
Mr.
Moss
,
deprecatingly
;
<EOS>
"
I
know
there
is
n't
a
day
-
laborer
works
harder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
use
o
'
that
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
sharply
,
"
when
a
man
marries
,
and
's
got
no
capital
to
work
his
farm
but
<EOS>
his
wife

<EOS>

<EOS>
I
was
against
it
from
the
first

but
you

neither

me

<EOS>
And
I
ca
n't
lie
out

and
there
'll
be
Tom

<EOS>
I
should
find
myself
short
,
even
saying
I
'd
got
back
all
as
is
my

<EOS>
You
must
look
about
and
see
how
you
can
pay
me
the
three
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
that
's
what
you
mean
,
"
said
Mr.
Moss
,
looking
blankly
before
him
,
"
we
'd
better
be
sold
up
,
and
ha
'
done
with
it
;
I
must
part
wi

every

stock
I
've

pay
you

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
relations
are
undeniably
irritating
,
 
their
existence
is
so
entirely
uncalled
for
on
our
part
,
and
they
are
almost
always
very
faulty
people
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
had
succeeded
in
getting
quite
as
much
irritated
with
Mr.
Moss
as
he
had
desired
,
and
he
was
able
to
say
angrily
,
rising
from
his
seat
,
    
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
must
do
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
_
I
_
ca
n't
find
money
for
everybody
else
as
well
as
myself
.
<EOS>
I
must
look
to
my
own
business
and
my
own
family
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
lie
out
<EOS>
o
'
my
money
any
longer
.
<EOS>
You
must
raise
it
as
quick
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
walked
abruptly
out
of
the
arbor
as
he
uttered
the
last
sentence
,
and
,
without
looking
round
at
Mr.
Moss
,
went
on
to
the
kitchen
door
,
where
the
eldest
boy
was
holding
his
horse
,
and
his
sister
was
waiting
in
a
state
of
wondering
alarm
,
which
was
not
without
its
alleviations
,
for
baby
was
making
pleasant
gurgling
sounds
,
and
performing
a
great
deal
of
finger
practice
on
the
faded
face
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Moss
had
eight
children
,
but
could
never
overcome
her
regret
that
the
twins
had
not
lived
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Moss
thought
their
removal
was
not
without
its
consolations
.
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
come
in
,
brother
?
"
she
said
,
looking
anxiously
at
her
husband
,
who
was
walking
slowly
up
,
while
Mr.
Tulliver
had
his
foot
already
in
the
stirrup
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
good
-
by
,
"
said
he
,
turning
his
horse
's
head
,
and
riding
away
.
  
<EOS>
No
man
could
feel
more
resolute
till
he
got
outside
the
yard
gate
,
and
a
little
way
along
the
deep
-
rutted
lane
;
but
before
he
reached
the
next
turning
,
which
would
take
him
out
of
sight
of
the
dilapidated
farm
-
buildings
,
he
appeared
to
be
smitten
by
some
sudden
thought
.
<EOS>
He
checked
his
horse
,
and
made
it
stand
still
in
the
same
spot
for
two
or
three
minutes
,
during
which
he
turned
his
head
from
side
to
side
in
a
melancholy
way
,
as
if
he
were
looking
at
some
painful
object
on
more
sides
than
one
.
<EOS>
Evidently
,
after
his
fit
of
promptitude
,
Mr.
Tulliver
was
relapsing
into
the
sense
that
this
is
a
puzzling
world
.
<EOS>
He
turned
his
horse
,
and
rode
slowly
back
,
giving
vent
to
the
climax
of
feeling
which
had
determined
this
movement
by
saying
aloud
,
as
he
struck
his
horse
,
"
Poor
little
wench
!
<EOS>
she
'll
have
nobody
but
Tom
,
belike
,
when
I
'm
gone
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
's
return
into
the
yard
was
descried
by
several
young
Mosses
,
who
immediately
ran
in
with
the
exciting
news
to
their
mother
,
so
that
Mrs.
Moss
was
again
on
the
door
-
step
when
her
brother
rode
up
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
crying
,
but
was
rocking
baby
to
sleep
in
her
arms
now
,
and
made
no
ostentatious
show
of
sorrow
as
her
brother
looked
at
her
,
but
merely
said
:
  
"
The
father
's
gone
to
the
field
,
again
,
if
you
want
him
,
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Gritty
,
no
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
in
a
gentle
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
fret
,
 
<EOS>
that
's
all
,
 
<EOS>
I
'll
make
a
shift
without
the
money
a
bit
,
only
you
must
be
as
clever
and
contriving
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Moss
's
tears
came
again
at
this
unexpected
kindness
,
and
she
could
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
!
 
<EOS>
the
little
wench
shall
come
and
see
you
.
<EOS>
I
'll
bring
her
and
Tom
some
day
before
he
goes
to
school
.
<EOS>
You
must
n't
fret
.
<EOS>
I
'll
allays
be
a
good
brother
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
for
that
word
,
brother
,
"
said
Mrs.
Moss
,
drying
her
tears
;
then
turning
to
Lizzy
,
she
said
,
"
Run
now
,
and
fetch
the
colored
egg
for
cousin
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzy
ran
in
,
and
quickly
reappeared
with
a
small
paper
parcel
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
boiled
hard
,
brother
,
and
colored
with
thrums
,
very
pretty
;
it
was
done
o
'
purpose
for
Maggie
.
<EOS>
Will
you
please
to
carry
it
in
your
pocket
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
putting
it
carefully
in
his
side
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
Good
-
by
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
the
respectable
miller
returned
along
the
Basset
lanes
rather
more
puzzled
than
before
as
to
ways
and
means
,
but
still
with
the
sense
of
a
danger
escaped
.
<EOS>
It
had
come
across
his
mind
that
if
he
were
hard
upon
his
sister
,
it
might
somehow
tend
to
make
Tom
hard
upon
Maggie
at
some
distant
day
,
when
her
father
was
no
longer
there
to
take
her
part
;
for
simple
people
,
like
our
friend
Mr.
Tulliver
,
are
apt
to
clothe
unimpeachable
feelings
in
erroneous
ideas
,
and
this
was
his
confused
way
of
explaining
to
himself
that
his
love
and
anxiety
for
"
the
little
wench
"
had
given
him
a
new
sensibility
toward
his
sister
.
    
<EOS>
To
Garum
Firs
  
<EOS>
While
the
possible
troubles
of
Maggie
's
future
were
occupying
her
father
's
mind
,
she
herself
was
tasting
only
the
bitterness
of
the
present
.
<EOS>
Childhood
has
no
forebodings
;
but
then
,
it
is
soothed
by
no
memories
of
outlived
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
The
fact
was
,
the
day
had
begun
ill
with
Maggie
.
<EOS>
The
pleasure
of
having
Lucy
to
look
at
,
and
the
prospect
of
the
afternoon
visit
to
Garum
Firs
,
where
she
would
hear
uncle
Pullet
's
musical
box
,
had
been
marred
as
early
as
eleven
o'clock
by
the
advent
of
the
hair
-
dresser
from
St.
Ogg
's
,
who
had
spoken
in
the
severest
terms
of
the
condition
in
which
he
had
found
her
hair
,
holding
up
one
jagged
lock
after
another
and
saying
,
"
See
here
!
<EOS>
tut
,
tut
,
tut
!
"
<EOS>
in
a
tone
of
mingled
disgust
and
pity
,
which
to
Maggie
's
imagination
was
equivalent
to
the
strongest
expression
of
public
opinion
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rappit
,
the
hair
-
dresser
,
with
his
well
-
anointed
coronal
locks
tending
wavily
upward
,
like
the
simulated
pyramid
of
flame
on
a
monumental
urn
,
seemed
to
her
at
that
moment
the
most
formidable
of
her
contemporaries
,
into
whose
street
at
St.
Ogg
's
she
would
carefully
refrain
from
entering
through
the
rest
of
her
life
.
  
<EOS>
Moreover
,
the
preparation
for
a
visit
being
always
a
serious
affair
in
the
Dodson
family
,
Martha
was
enjoined
to
have
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
room
ready
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
,
that
the
laying
out
of
the
best
clothes
might
not
be
deferred
till
the
last
moment
,
as
was
sometimes
the
case
in
families
of
lax
views
,
where
the
ribbon
-
strings
were
never
rolled
up
,
where
there
was
little
or
no
wrapping
in
silver
paper
,
and
where
the
sense
that
the
Sunday
clothes
could
be
got
at
quite
easily
produced
no
shock
to
the
mind
.
<EOS>
Already
,
at
twelve
o'clock
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
on
her
visiting
costume
,
with
a
protective
apparatus
of
brown
holland
,
as
if
she
had
been
a
piece
of
satin
furniture
in
danger
of
flies
;
Maggie
was
frowning
and
twisting
her
shoulders
,
that
she
might
if
possible
shrink
away
from
the
prickliest
of
tuckers
,
while
her
mother
was
remonstrating
,
"
Do
n't
,
Maggie
,
my
dear
;
do
n't
make
yourself
so
ugly
!
"
<EOS>
and
Tom
's
cheeks
were
looking
particularly
brilliant
as
a
relief
to
his
best
blue
suit
,
which
he
wore
with
becoming
calmness
,
having
,
after
a
little
wrangling
,
effected
what
was
always
the
one
point
of
interest
to
him
in
his
toilet
:
he
had
transferred
all
the
contents
of
his
every
-
day
pockets
to
those
actually
in
wear
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
Lucy
,
she
was
just
as
pretty
and
neat
as
she
had
been
yesterday
;
no
accidents
ever
happened
to
her
clothes
,
and
she
was
never
uncomfortable
in
them
,
so
that
she
looked
with
wondering
pity
at
Maggie
,
pouting
and
writhing
under
the
exasperating
tucker
.
<EOS>
Maggie
would
certainly
have
torn
it
off
,
if
she
had
not
been
checked
by
the
remembrance
of
her
recent
humiliation
about
her
hair
;
as
it
was
,
she
confined
herself
to
fretting
and
twisting
,
and
behaving
peevishly
about
the
card
-
houses
which
they
were
allowed
to
build
till
dinner
,
as
a
suitable
amusement
for
boys
and
girls
in
their
best
clothes
.
<EOS>
Tom
could
build
perfect
pyramids
of
houses
;
but
Maggie
's
would
never
bear
the
laying
on
the
roof
.
<EOS>
It
was
always
so
with
the
things
that
Maggie
made
;
and
Tom
had
deduced
the
conclusion
that
no
girls
could
ever
make
anything
.
<EOS>
But
it
happened
that
Lucy
proved
wonderfully
clever
at
building
;
she
handled
the
cards
so
lightly
,
and
moved
so
gently
,
that
Tom
condescended
to
admire
her
houses
as
well
as
his
own
,
the
more
readily
because
she
had
asked
him
to
teach
her
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
too
,
would
have
admired
Lucy
's
houses
,
and
would
have
given
up
her
own
unsuccessful
building
to
contemplate
them
,
without
ill
temper
,
if
her
tucker
had
not
made
her
peevish
,
and
if
Tom
had
not
inconsiderately
laughed
when
her
houses
fell
,
and
told
her
she
was
"
a
stupid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
laugh
at
me
,
Tom
!
"
she
burst
out
angrily
;
"
I
'm
not
a
stupid
.
<EOS>
I
know
a
great
many
things
you
do
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
dare
say
,
Miss
Spitfire
!
<EOS>
I
'd
never
be
such
a
cross
thing
as
you
,
making
faces
like
that
.
<EOS>
Lucy
does
n't
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
like
Lucy
better
than
you
;
_
<EOS>
I
_
wish
<EOS>
Lucy
was
_
my
_
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
's
very
wicked
and
cruel
of
you
to
wish
so
,
"
said
Maggie
,
starting
up
hurriedly
from
her
place
on
the
floor
,
and
upsetting
Tom
's
wonderful
pagoda
.
<EOS>
She
really
did
not
mean
it
,
but
the
circumstantial
evidence
was
against
her
,
and
Tom
turned
white
with
anger
,
but
said
nothing
;
he
would
have
struck
her
,
only
he
knew
it
was
cowardly
to
strike
a
girl
,
and
Tom
Tulliver
was
quite
determined
he
would
never
do
anything
cowardly
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
stood
in
dismay
and
terror
,
while
Tom
got
up
from
the
floor
and
walked
away
,
pale
,
from
the
scattered
ruins
of
his
pagoda
,
and
Lucy
looked
on
mutely
,
like
a
kitten
pausing
from
its
lapping
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Tom
,
"
said
Maggie
,
at
last
,
going
half
-
way
toward
him
,
"
I
did
n't
mean
to
knock
it
down
,
indeed
,
indeed
I
did
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
took
no
notice
of
her
,
but
took
,
instead
,
two
or
three
hard
peas
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
shot
them
with
his
thumbnail
against
the
window
,
vaguely
at
first
,
but
presently
with
the
distinct
aim
of
hitting
a
superannuated
blue
-
bottle
which
was
exposing
its
imbecility
in
the
spring
sunshine
,
clearly
against
the
views
of
Nature
,
who
had
provided
Tom
and
the
peas
for
the
speedy
destruction
of
this
weak
individual
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
the
morning
had
been
made
heavy
to
Maggie
,
and
Tom
's
persistent
coldness
to
her
all
through
their
walk
spoiled
the
fresh
air
and
sunshine
for
her
.
<EOS>
He
called
Lucy
to
look
at
the
half
-
built
bird
's
nest
without
caring
to
show
it
Maggie
,
and
peeled
a
willow
switch
for
Lucy
and
himself
,
without
offering
one
to
Maggie
.
<EOS>
Lucy
had
said
,
"
Maggie
,
should
n't
_
you
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
like
one
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
Tom
was
deaf
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
the
sight
of
the
peacock
opportunely
spreading
his
tail
on
the
stackyard
wall
,
just
as
they
reached
Garum
Firs
,
was
enough
to
divert
the
mind
temporarily
from
personal
grievances
.
<EOS>
And
this
was
only
the
beginning
of
beautiful
sights
at
Garum
Firs
.
<EOS>
All
the
farmyard
life
was
wonderful
there
,
 
bantams
,
speckled
and
top
-
knotted
;
Friesland
hens
,
with
their
feathers
all
turned
the
wrong
way
;
Guinea
-
fowls
that
flew
and
screamed
and
dropped
their
pretty
spotted
feathers
;
pouter
-
pigeons
and
a
tame
magpie
;
nay
,
a
goat
,
and
a
wonderful
brindled
dog
,
half
mastiff
,
half
bull
-
dog
,
as
large
as
a
lion
.
<EOS>
Then
there
were
white
railings
and
white
gates
all
about
,
and
glittering
weathercocks
of
various
design
,
and
garden
-
walks
paved
with
pebbles
in
beautiful
patterns
,
 
nothing
was
quite
common
at
Garum
Firs
;
and
Tom
thought
that
the
unusual
size
of
the
toads
there
was
simply
due
to
the
general
unusualness
which
characterized
uncle
Pullet
's
possessions
as
a
gentleman
farmer
.
<EOS>
Toads
who
paid
rent
were
naturally
leaner
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
house
,
it
was
not
less
remarkable
;
it
had
a
receding
centre
,
and
two
wings
with
battlemented
turrets
,
and
was
covered
with
glittering
white
stucco
.
  
<EOS>
Uncle
Pullet
had
seen
the
expected
party
approaching
from
the
window
,
and
made
haste
to
unbar
and
unchain
the
front
door
,
kept
always
in
this
fortified
condition
from
fear
of
tramps
,
who
might
be
supposed
to
know
of
the
glass
case
of
stuffed
birds
in
the
hall
,
and
to
contemplate
rushing
in
and
carrying
it
away
on
their
heads
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Pullet
,
too
,
appeared
at
the
doorway
,
and
as
soon
as
her
sister
was
within
hearing
said
,
"
Stop
the
children
,
for
God
's
sake
!
<EOS>
Bessy
;
do
n't
let
'em
come
up
the
door
-
steps
;
Sally
's
bringing
the
old
mat
and
the
duster
,
to
rub
their
shoes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pullet
's
front
-
door
mats
were
by
no
means
intended
to
wipe
shoes
on
;
the
very
scraper
had
a
deputy
to
do
its
dirty
work
.
<EOS>
Tom
rebelled
particularly
against
this
shoewiping
,
which
he
always
considered
in
the
light
of
an
indignity
to
his
sex
.
<EOS>
He
felt
it
as
the
beginning
of
the
disagreeables
incident
to
a
visit
at
aunt
Pullet
's
,
where
he
had
once
been
compelled
to
sit
with
towels
wrapped
round
his
boots
;
a
fact
which
may
serve
to
correct
the
too
-
hasty
conclusion
that
a
visit
to
Garum
Firs
must
have
been
a
great
treat
to
a
young
gentleman
fond
of
animals
,
 
fond
,
that
is
,
of
throwing
stones
at
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
disagreeable
was
confined
to
his
feminine
companions
;
it
was
the
mounting
of
the
polished
oak
stairs
,
which
had
very
handsome
carpets
rolled
up
and
laid
by
in
a
spare
bedroom
,
so
that
the
ascent
of
these
glossy
steps
might
have
served
,
in
barbarous
times
,
as
a
trial
by
ordeal
from
which
none
but
the
most
spotless
virtue
could
have
come
off
with
unbroken
limbs
.
<EOS>
Sophy
's
weakness
about
these
polished
stairs
was
always
a
subject
of
bitter
remonstrance
on
Mrs.
Glegg
's
part
;
but
Mrs.
Tulliver
ventured
on
no
comment
,
only
thinking
to
herself
it
was
a
mercy
when
she
and
the
children
were
safe
on
the
landing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Gray
has
sent
home
my
new
bonnet
,
Bessy
,
"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
in
a
pathetic
tone
,
as
Mrs.
Tulliver
adjusted
her
cap
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
she
,
sister
?
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
with
an
air
of
much
interest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
do
you
like
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
apt
to
make
a
mess
with
clothes
,
taking
'em
out
and
putting
'em
in
again
,
"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
drawing
a
bunch
of
keys
from
her
pocket
and
looking
at
them
earnestly
,
"
but
it
'
ud
be
a
pity
for
you
to
go
away
without
seeing
it
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
knowing
what
may
happen
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pullet
shook
her
head
slowly
at
this
last
serious
consideration
,
which
determined
her
to
single
out
a
particular
key
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
it
'll
be
troublesome
to
you
getting
it
out
,
sister
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
;
"
but
I
_
should
_
like
to
see
what
sort
of
a
crown
she
's
made
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pullet
rose
with
a
melancholy
air
and
unlocked
one
wing
of
a
very
bright
wardrobe
,
where
you
may
have
hastily
supposed
she
would
find
a
new
bonnet
.
<EOS>
Not
at
all
.
<EOS>
Such
a
supposition
could
only
have
arisen
from
a
too
-
superficial
acquaintance
with
the
habits
of
the
Dodson
family
.
<EOS>
In
this
wardrobe
Mrs.
Pullet
was
seeking
something
small
enough
to
be
hidden
among
layers
of
linen
,
 
it
was
a
door
-
key
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
come
with
me
into
the
best
room
,
"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
the
children
come
too
,
sister
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
who
saw
that
Maggie
and
Lucy
were
looking
rather
eager
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
aunt
Pullet
,
reflectively
,
"
<EOS>
it
'll
perhaps
be
safer
for
'em
to
come
;
they
'll
be
touching
something
if
we
leave
'em
behind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
they
went
in
procession
along
the
bright
and
slippery
corridor
,
dimly
lighted
by
the
semi
-
lunar
top
of
the
window
which
rose
above
the
closed
shutter
;
it
was
really
quite
solemn
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Pullet
paused
and
unlocked
a
door
which
opened
on
something
still
more
solemn
than
the
passage
,
 
a
darkened
room
,
in
which
the
outer
light
,
entering
feebly
,
showed
what
looked
like
the
corpses
of
furniture
in
white
shrouds
.
<EOS>
Everything
that
was
not
shrouded
stood
with
its
legs
upward
.
<EOS>
Lucy
laid
hold
of
Maggie
's
frock
,
and
Maggie
's
heart
beat
rapidly
.
  
<EOS>
Aunt
Pullet
half
-
opened
the
shutter
and
then
unlocked
the
wardrobe
,
with
a
melancholy
deliberateness
which
was
quite
in
keeping
with
the
funereal
solemnity
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
The
delicious
scent
of
rose
-
leaves
that
issued
from
the
wardrobe
made
the
process
of
taking
out
sheet
after
sheet
of
silver
paper
quite
pleasant
to
assist
at
,
though
the
sight
of
the
bonnet
at
last
was
an
anticlimax
to
Maggie
,
who
would
have
preferred
something
more
strikingly
preternatural
.
<EOS>
But
few
things
could
have
been
more
impressive
to
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
She
looked
all
round
it
in
silence
for
some
moments
,
and
then
said
emphatically
,
"
Well
,
sister
,
I
'll
never
speak
against
the
full
crowns
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
concession
,
and
Mrs.
Pullet
felt
it
;
she
felt
something
was
due
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'd
like
to
see
it
on
,
sister
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
open
the
shutter
a
bit
further
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
taking
off
your
cap
,
sister
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pullet
took
off
her
cap
,
displaying
the
brown
silk
scalp
with
a
jutting
promontory
of
curls
which
was
common
to
the
more
mature
and
judicious
women
of
those
times
,
and
placing
the
bonnet
on
her
head
,
turned
slowly
round
,
like
a
draper
's
lay
-
figure
,
that
Mrs.
Tulliver
might
miss
no
point
of
view
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
sometimes
thought
there
's
a
loop
too
much
o
'
ribbon
on
this
left
side
,
sister
;
what
do
you
think
?
"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
looked
earnestly
at
the
point
indicated
,
and
turned
her
head
on
one
side
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
think
it
's
best
as
it
is
;
if
you
meddled
with
it
,
sister
,
you
might
repent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
"
said
aunt
Pullet
,
taking
off
the
bonnet
and
looking
at
it
contemplatively
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
much
might
she
charge
you
for
that
bonnet
,
sister
?
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
whose
mind
was
actively
engaged
on
the
possibility
of
getting
a
humble
imitation
of
this
_
chef
-
d'œuvre
_
made
from
a
piece
of
silk
she
had
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pullet
screwed
up
her
mouth
and
shook
her
head
,
and
then
whispered
,
"
Pullet
pays
for
it
;
he
said
I
was
to
have
the
best
bonnet
at
Garum
Church
,
let
the
next
best
be
whose
it
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
began
slowly
to
adjust
the
trimmings
,
in
preparation
for
returning
it
to
its
place
in
the
wardrobe
,
and
her
thoughts
seemed
to
have
taken
a
melancholy
turn
,
for
she
shook
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
she
said
at
last
,
"
I
may
never
wear
it
twice
,
sister
;
who
knows
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
talk
o
'
that
sister
,
"
answered
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
'll
have
your
health
this
summer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
but
there
may
come
a
death
in
the
family
,
as
there
did
soon
after
I
had
my
green
satin
bonnet
.
<EOS>
Cousin
Abbott
may
go
,
and
we
ca
n't
think
o
'
wearing
crape
less
nor
half
a
year
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
_
would
_
be
unlucky
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
entering
thoroughly
into
the
possibility
of
an
inopportune
decease
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
never
so
much
pleasure
<EOS>
i
'
wearing
a
bonnet
the
second
year
,
especially
when
the
crowns
are
so
chancy
,
 
never
two
summers
alike
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
it
's
the
way
<EOS>
i
'
this
world
,
"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
returning
the
bonnet
to
the
wardrobe
and
locking
it
up
.
<EOS>
She
maintained
a
silence
characterized
by
head
-
shaking
,
until
they
had
all
issued
from
the
solemn
chamber
and
were
in
her
own
room
again
.
<EOS>
Then
,
beginning
to
cry
,
she
said
,
"
Sister
,
if
you
should
never
see
that
bonnet
again
till
I
'm
dead
and
gone
,
you
'll
remember
I
showed
it
you
this
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
felt
that
she
ought
to
be
affected
,
but
she
was
a
woman
of
sparse
tears
,
stout
and
healthy
;
she
could
n't
cry
so
much
as
her
sister
Pullet
did
,
and
had
often
felt
her
deficiency
at
funerals
.
<EOS>
Her
effort
to
bring
tears
into
her
eyes
issued
in
an
odd
contraction
of
her
face
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
looking
on
attentively
,
felt
that
there
was
some
painful
mystery
about
her
aunt
's
bonnet
which
she
was
considered
too
young
to
understand
;
indignantly
conscious
,
all
the
while
,
that
she
could
have
understood
that
,
as
well
as
everything
else
,
if
she
had
been
taken
into
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
went
down
,
uncle
Pullet
observed
,
with
some
acumen
,
that
he
reckoned
the
missis
had
been
showing
her
bonnet
,
 
that
was
what
had
made
them
so
long
upstairs
.
<EOS>
With
Tom
the
interval
had
seemed
still
longer
,
for
he
had
been
seated
in
irksome
constraint
on
the
edge
of
a
sofa
directly
opposite
his
uncle
Pullet
,
who
regarded
him
with
twinkling
gray
eyes
,
and
occasionally
addressed
him
as
"
Young
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
young
sir
,
what
do
you
learn
at
school
?
<EOS>
"
was
a
standing
question
with
uncle
Pullet
;
whereupon
Tom
always
looked
sheepish
,
rubbed
his
hands
across
his
face
,
and
answered
,
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
altogether
so
embarrassing
to
be
seated
_
tête
-
à
-
tête
_
with
uncle
Pullet
,
that
Tom
could
not
even
look
at
the
prints
on
the
walls
,
or
the
flycages
,
or
the
wonderful
flower
-
pots
;
he
saw
nothing
but
his
uncle
's
gaiters
.
<EOS>
Not
that
Tom
was
in
awe
of
his
uncle
's
mental
superiority
;
indeed
,
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
did
n't
want
to
be
a
gentleman
farmer
,
because
he
should
n't
like
to
be
such
a
thin
-
legged
,
silly
fellow
as
his
uncle
Pullet
,
 
a
molly
-
coddle
,
in
fact
.
<EOS>
A
boy
's
sheepishness
is
by
no
means
a
sign
of
overmastering
reverence
;
and
while
you
are
making
encouraging
advances
to
him
under
the
idea
that
he
is
overwhelmed
by
a
sense
of
your
age
and
wisdom
,
ten
to
one
he
is
thinking
you
extremely
queer
.
<EOS>
The
only
consolation
I
can
suggest
to
you
is
,
that
the
Greek
boys
probably
thought
the
same
of
Aristotle
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
when
you
have
mastered
a
restive
horse
,
or
thrashed
a
drayman
,
or
have
got
a
gun
in
your
hand
,
that
these
shy
juniors
feel
you
to
be
a
truly
admirable
and
enviable
character
.
<EOS>
At
least
,
I
am
quite
sure
of
Tom
Tulliver
's
sentiments
on
these
points
.
<EOS>
In
very
tender
years
,
when
he
still
wore
a
lace
border
under
his
outdoor
cap
,
he
was
often
observed
peeping
through
the
bars
of
a
gate
and
making
minatory
gestures
with
his
small
forefinger
while
he
scolded
the
sheep
with
an
inarticulate
burr
,
intended
to
strike
terror
into
their
astonished
minds
;
indicating
thus
early
that
desire
for
mastery
over
the
inferior
animals
,
wild
and
domestic
,
including
cockchafers
,
neighbors
'
dogs
,
and
small
sisters
,
which
in
all
ages
has
been
an
attribute
of
so
much
promise
for
the
fortunes
of
our
race
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr.
Pullet
never
rode
anything
taller
than
a
low
pony
,
and
was
the
least
predatory
of
men
,
considering
firearms
dangerous
,
as
apt
to
go
off
of
themselves
by
nobody
's
particular
desire
.
<EOS>
So
that
Tom
was
not
without
strong
reasons
when
,
in
confidential
talk
with
a
chum
,
he
had
described
uncle
Pullet
as
a
nincompoop
,
taking
care
at
the
same
time
to
observe
that
he
was
a
very
"
rich
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
only
alleviating
circumstance
in
a
_
tête
-
à
-
tête
_
with
uncle
Pullet
was
that
he
kept
a
variety
of
lozenges
and
peppermint
-
drops
about
his
person
,
and
when
at
a
loss
for
conversation
,
he
filled
up
the
void
by
proposing
a
mutual
solace
of
this
kind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
like
peppermints
,
young
sir
?
"
<EOS>
required
only
a
tacit
answer
when
it
was
accompanied
by
a
presentation
of
the
article
in
question
.
  
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
the
little
girls
suggested
to
uncle
Pullet
the
further
solace
of
small
sweet
-
cakes
,
of
which
he
also
kept
a
stock
under
lock
and
key
for
his
own
private
eating
on
wet
days
;
but
the
three
children
had
no
sooner
got
the
tempting
delicacy
between
their
fingers
,
than
aunt
Pullet
desired
them
to
abstain
from
eating
it
till
the
tray
and
the
plates
came
,
since
with
those
crisp
cakes
they
would
make
the
floor
"
all
over
"
crumbs
.
<EOS>
Lucy
did
n't
mind
that
much
,
for
the
cake
was
so
pretty
<EOS>
,
she
thought
it
was
rather
a
pity
to
eat
it
;
but
Tom
,
watching
his
opportunity
while
the
elders
were
talking
,
hastily
stowed
it
in
his
mouth
at
two
bites
,
and
chewed
it
furtively
.
<EOS>
As
for
Maggie
,
becoming
fascinated
,
as
usual
,
by
a
print
of
Ulysses
and
Nausicaa
,
which
uncle
Pullet
had
bought
as
a
"
pretty
Scripture
thing
,
"
she
presently
let
fall
her
cake
,
and
in
an
unlucky
movement
crushed
it
beneath
her
foot
,
 
a
source
of
so
much
agitation
to
aunt
Pullet
and
conscious
disgrace
to
Maggie
,
that
she
began
to
despair
of
hearing
the
musical
snuff
-
box
to
-
day
,
<EOS>
till
,
after
some
reflection
,
it
occurred
to
her
that
Lucy
was
in
high
favor
enough
to
venture
on
asking
for
a
tune
.
<EOS>
So
she
whispered
to
Lucy
;
and
Lucy
,
who
always
did
what
she
was
desired
to
do
,
went
up
quietly
to
her
uncle
's
knee
,
and
blush
-
all
over
her
neck
while
she
fingered
her
necklace
,
said
,
"
Will
you
please
play
us
a
tune
,
uncle
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
thought
it
was
by
reason
of
some
exceptional
talent
in
uncle
Pullet
that
the
snuff
-
box
played
such
beautiful
tunes
,
and
indeed
the
thing
was
viewed
in
that
light
by
the
majority
of
his
neighbors
in
Garum
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Pullet
had
_
bought
_
the
box
,
to
begin
with
,
and
he
understood
winding
it
up
,
and
knew
which
tune
it
was
going
to
play
beforehand
;
altogether
the
possession
of
this
unique
"
piece
of
music
"
was
a
proof
that
Mr.
Pullet
's
character
was
not
of
that
entire
nullity
which
might
otherwise
have
been
attributed
to
it
.
<EOS>
But
uncle
Pullet
,
when
entreated
to
exhibit
his
accomplishment
,
never
depreciated
it
by
a
too
-
ready
consent
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
see
about
it
,
"
was
the
answer
he
always
gave
,
carefully
abstaining
from
any
sign
of
compliance
till
a
suitable
number
of
minutes
had
passed
.
<EOS>
Uncle
Pullet
had
a
programme
for
all
great
social
occasions
,
and
in
this
way
fenced
himself
in
from
much
painful
confusion
and
perplexing
freedom
of
will
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
suspense
did
heighten
Maggie
's
enjoyment
when
the
fairy
tune
began
;
for
the
first
time
she
quite
forgot
that
she
had
a
load
on
her
mind
,
that
Tom
was
angry
with
her
;
and
by
the
time
"
Hush
,
ye
pretty
warbling
choir
,
"
had
been
played
<EOS>
,
her
face
wore
that
bright
look
of
happiness
,
while
she
sat
immovable
with
her
hands
clasped
,
which
sometimes
comforted
her
mother
with
the
sense
that
Maggie
could
look
pretty
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
in
spite
of
her
brown
skin
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
magic
music
ceased
,
she
jumped
up
,
and
running
toward
Tom
,
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
said
,
"
Oh
,
Tom
,
is
n't
it
pretty
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lest
you
should
think
it
showed
a
revolting
insensibility
in
Tom
that
he
felt
any
new
anger
toward
Maggie
for
this
uncalled
-
for
and
,
to
him
,
inexplicable
caress
,
I
must
tell
you
that
he
had
his
glass
of
cowslip
wine
in
his
hand
,
and
that
she
jerked
him
so
as
to
make
him
spill
half
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
been
an
extreme
milksop
not
to
say
angrily
,
"
<EOS>
Look
there
,
now
!
"
<EOS>
especially
when
his
resentment
was
sanctioned
,
as
it
was
,
by
general
disapprobation
of
Maggie
's
behavior
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
sit
still
,
Maggie
?
"
<EOS>
her
mother
said
peevishly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Little
gells
must
n't
come
to
see
me
if
they
behave
in
that
way
,
"
said
aunt
Pullet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
're
too
rough
,
little
miss
,
"
said
uncle
Pullet
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Maggie
sat
down
again
,
with
the
music
all
chased
out
of
her
soul
,
and
the
seven
small
demons
all
in
again
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
foreseeing
nothing
but
misbehavior
while
the
children
remained
indoors
,
took
an
early
opportunity
of
suggesting
that
,
now
they
were
rested
after
their
walk
,
they
might
go
and
play
out
of
doors
;
and
aunt
Pullet
gave
permission
,
only
enjoining
them
not
to
go
off
the
paved
walks
in
the
garden
,
and
if
they
wanted
to
see
the
poultry
fed
,
to
view
them
from
a
distance
on
the
horse
-
block
;
a
restriction
which
had
been
imposed
ever
since
Tom
had
been
found
guilty
of
running
after
the
peacock
,
with
an
illusory
idea
that
fright
would
make
one
of
its
feathers
drop
off
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
thoughts
had
been
temporarily
diverted
from
the
quarrel
with
Mrs.
Glegg
by
millinery
and
maternal
cares
,
but
now
the
great
theme
of
the
bonnet
was
thrown
into
perspective
,
and
the
children
were
out
of
the
way
,
yesterday
's
anxieties
recurred
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
weighs
on
my
mind
so
as
never
was
,
"
she
said
,
by
way
of
opening
the
subject
,
"
sister
Glegg
's
leaving
the
house
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
'd
no
wish
<EOS>
t
"
offend
a
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
aunt
Pullet
,
"
there
's
no
accounting
for
what
Jane
"
ull
do
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
speak
of
it
out
o
'
<EOS>
the
family
,
if
it
was
n't
to
Dr.
Turnbull
;
<EOS>
but
it
's
<EOS>
my
belief
Jane
lives
too
low
.
<EOS>
I
've
said
so
to
Pullet
often
and
often
,
and
he
knows
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
said
so
last
Monday
was
a
week
,
when
we
came
away
from
drinking
tea
with

em

"
said
Mr.
Pullet
,
beginning
to
nurse
his
knee
and
shelter
it
with
his
pocket
-
hand
-
kerchief
,
as
was
his
way
when
the
conversation
took
an
interesting
turn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
like
I
did
,
"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
"
for
you
remember
when
I
said
things
,
better
than
I
can
remember
myself
.
<EOS>
He
's
got
a
wonderful
memory
,
Pullet
has
,
"
she
continued
,
looking
pathetically
at
her
sister
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
poorly
off
if
he
was
to
have
a
stroke
,
for
he
always
remembers
when
I
've
got
to
take
my
doctor
's
stuff
;
and
I
'm
taking
three
sorts
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
"
pills
as
before
"
every
other
night
,
and
the
new
drops
at
eleven
and
four
,
and
the
"
fervescing
mixture
"
when
agreeable
,
"
"
rehearsed
Mr.
Pullet
,
with
a
punctuation
determined
by
a
lozenge
on
his
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
perhaps
it
'
ud
be
better
for
sister
Glegg
<EOS>
if
_
<EOS>
she
'd

go
to

sometimes
,
<EOS>
instead
o
'
chewing
Turkey
rhubarb
<EOS>
whenever
there
's
anything
the
matter
with

,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
who
naturally
saw
the
wide
subject
of
medicine
chiefly
in
relation
to
Mrs.
Glegg
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
dreadful
to
think
on
,
"
said
aunt
Pullet
,
raising
her
hands
and
letting
them
fall
again
,
"
people
playing
with

And

it

Well

no

"
  
"
_
I
_
do
n't
want
to
make
the
worst
of
you
,
Bessy
,
"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
compassionately
,
"
for
I
doubt
you
'll
have
trouble
enough
without
that
;
and
your
husband
's
got
that
poor
sister
and
her
children
hanging
on
him
,
 
and
so
given
to
lawing
<EOS>
,
they
say
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
he
'll
leave
you
poorly
off
when
he
dies
.
<EOS>
Not
as
I
'd
have
it
said
out
o
'
the
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
view
of
her
position
was
naturally
far
from
cheering
to
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
Her
imagination
was
not
easily
acted
on
,
but
she
could
not
help
thinking
that
her
case
was
a
hard
one
,
since
it
appeared
that
other
people
thought
it
hard
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
,
sister
,
I
ca
n't
help
myself
,
"
she
said
,
urged
by
the
fear
lest
her
anticipated
misfortunes
might
be
held
retributive
,
to
take
comprehensive
review
of
her
past
conduct
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
woman
strives
more
for
her
children
;
and
I
'm
sure
at
scouring
-
time
this
Lady
-
day
as
I
've
had
all
the
bedhangings
taken
down
<EOS>
I
did
as
much
as
the
two
gells
put
together
;
and
there
's
the
last
elder
-
flower
wine
I
've
made
 
beautiful
!
<EOS>
I
allays
offer
it
along
with
the
sherry
,
though
sister
Glegg
will
have
it
<EOS>
I
'm
so
extravagant
;
and
as
for
liking
to
have
my
clothes
tidy
,
and
not
go
a
fright
about
the
house
,
there
's
nobody
in
the
parish
can
say
anything
against
me
in
respect
o
'
backbiting
and
making
mischief
,
for
I
do
n't
wish
anybody
any
harm
;
and
nobody
loses
by
sending
me
a
porkpie
,
for
my
pies
are
fit
to
show
with
the
best
o
'
my
neighbors
"
;
and
the
linen
's
so
in
order
as
if
I
was
to
die
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
should
n't
be
ashamed
.
<EOS>
A
woman
can
do
no
more
nor
she
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
all
o
'
no
use
,
you
know
,
Bessy
,
"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
holding
her
head
on
one
side
,
and
fixing
her
eyes
pathetically
on
her
sister
,
"
if
your
husband
makes
away
with
his
money
.
<EOS>
Not
but
what
if
you
was
sold
up
,
and
other
folks
bought
your
furniture
,
it
's
a
comfort
to
think
as
you
've
kept
it
well
rubbed
.
<EOS>
And
there
's
the
linen
,
with
your
maiden
mark
on
,
might
go
all
over
the
country
.
<EOS>
It
'
ud
be
a
sad
pity
for
our
family
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pullet
shook
her
head
slowly
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
can
I
do
,
sister
?
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
's
not
a
man
to
be
dictated
to
,
 
not
if
I
was
to
go
to
the
parson
and
get
by
heart
what
I
should
tell
my
husband
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
And
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
pretend
to
know
anything
about
putting
out
money
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
I
could
never
see
into
men
's
business
as
sister
Glegg
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
're
like
me
in
that
,
Bessy
,
"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
;
"
and
I
think
it
'
ud
be
<EOS>
a
deal
more
becoming
o
'
Jane
if
she
'd
have
that
pier
-
glass
rubbed
oftener
<EOS>
,
 
there
was
ever
so
many
spots
on
it
last
week
,
 
instead
o
'
dictating
to
folks
as
have
more
comings
in
than
she
ever
had
,
and
telling
'em
what
they
're
to
do
with
their
money
.
<EOS>
But
Jane
and
me
were
allays
contrairy
;
she
_
would
_
have
striped
things
,
and
I
like
spots
.
<EOS>
You
like
a
spot
too
,
Bessy
;
we
allays
hung
together
<EOS>
i
'
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
Sophy
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
"
I
remember
our
having
a
blue
ground
with
a
white
spot
both
alike
,
 
I
've
got
a
bit
in
a
bed
-
quilt
now
;
and
if
you
would
but
go
and
see
sister
Glegg
,
and
persuade
her
to
make
it
up
with
Tulliver
,
I
should
take
it
very
kind
of
you
.
<EOS>
You
was
allays
a
good
sister
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
right
thing
'
ud
be
for
Tulliver
to
go
and
make
it
up
with
her
himself
,
and
say
he
was
sorry
for
speaking
so
rash
.
<EOS>
If
he
's
borrowed
money
of
her
,
he
should
n't
be
above
that
,
"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
whose
partiality
did
not
blind
her
to
principles
;
she
did
not
forget
what
was
due
to
people
of
independent
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
use
talking
o
'
that
,
"
said
poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
almost
peevishly
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
was
to
go
down
on
my
bare
knees
on
the
gravel
to
Tulliver
,
he
'd
never
humble
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
ca
n't
expect
me
to
persuade
_
Jane
_
to
beg
pardon
,
"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
temper
's
beyond
everything
;
it
's
well
if
it
does
n't
carry
her
off
her
mind
,
though
there
never
_
was
_
<EOS>
any
of
our
family
went
to
a
madhouse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
thinking
of
her
begging
pardon
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
she
'd
just
take
no
notice
,
and
not
call
her
money
in
;
as
it
's
not
so
much
for
one
sister
to
ask
of
another
;
time
'
ud
mend
things
,
and
Tulliver
'
ud
forget
all
about
it
,
and
they
'd
be
friends
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
you
perceive
,
was
not
aware
of
her
husband
's
irrevocable
determination
to
pay
in
the
five
hundred
pounds
;
at
least
such
a
determination
exceeded
her
powers
of
belief
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Bessy
,
"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
mournfully
,
"
_
I
_
do
n't
want
to
help
you
on
to
ruin
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
be
behindhand
<EOS>
i
'
doing
you
a
good
turn
,
if
it
is
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
like
it
said
among
acquaintance
as
we
've
got
quarrels
in
the
family
.
<EOS>
I
shall
tell
Jane
that
;
and
I
do
n't
mind
driving
to
Jane
's
tomorrow
,
if
Pullet
does
n't
mind
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
,
Mr.
Pullet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
no
objections
,
"
said
Mr.
Pullet
,
who
was
perfectly
contented
with
any
course
the
quarrel
might
take
,
so
that
Mr.
Tulliver
did
not
apply
to
_
him
_
for
money
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Pullet
was
nervous
about
his
investments
,
and
did
not
see
how
a
man
could
have
any
security
for
his
money
unless
he
turned
it
into
land
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
little
further
discussion
as
to
whether
it
would
not
be
better
for
Mrs.
Tulliver
to
accompany
them
on
a
visit
to
sister
Glegg
,
Mrs.
Pullet
,
observing
that
it
was
tea
-
time
,
turned
to
reach
from
a
drawer
a
delicate
damask
napkin
,
which
she
pinned
before
her
in
the
fashion
of
an
apron
.
<EOS>
The
door
did
,
in
fact
,
soon
open
,
but
instead
of
the
tea
-
tray
,
Sally
introduced
an
object
so
startling
that
both
Mrs.
Pullet
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
gave
a
scream
,
causing
uncle
Pullet
to
swallow
his
lozenge
 
for
the
fifth
time
in
his
life
,
as
he
afterward
noted
.
    
<EOS>
Maggie
Behaves
Worse
Than
She
Expected
  
The
startling
object
which
thus
made
an
epoch
for
uncle
Pullet
was
no
other
than
little
Lucy
,
with
one
side
of
her
person
,
from
her
small
foot
to
her
bonnet
-
crown
,
wet
and
discolored
with
mud
,
holding
out
two
tiny
blackened
hands
,
and
making
a
very
piteous
face
.
<EOS>
To
account
for
this
unprecedented
apparition
in
aunt
Pullet
's
parlor
,
we
must
return
to
the
moment
when
the
three
children
went
to
play
out
of
doors
,
and
the
small
demons
who
had
taken
possession
of
Maggie
's
soul
at
an
early
period
of
the
day
had
returned
in
all
the
greater
force
after
a
temporary
absence
.
<EOS>
All
the
disagreeable
recollections
of
the
morning
were
thick
upon
her
,
when
Tom
,
whose
displeasure
toward
her
had
been
considerably
refreshed
by
her
foolish
trick
of
causing
him
to
upset
his
cowslip
wine
,
said
,
"
Here
,
Lucy
,
you
come
along
with
me
,
"
and
walked
off
to
the
area
where
the
toads
were
,
as
if
there
were
no
Maggie
in
existence
.
<EOS>
Seeing
this
,
Maggie
lingered
at
a
distance
looking
like
a
small
Medusa
with
her
snakes
cropped
.
<EOS>
Lucy
was
naturally
pleased
that
cousin
Tom
was
so
good
to
her
,
and
it
was
very
amusing
to
see
him
tickling
a
fat
toad
with
a
piece
of
string
when
the
toad
was
safe
down
the
area
,
with
an
iron
grating
over
him
.
<EOS>
Still
Lucy
wished
Maggie
to
enjoy
the
spectacle
also
,
especially
as
she
would
doubtless
find
a
name
for
the
toad
,
and
say
what
had
been
his
past
history
;
for
Lucy
had
a
delighted
semibelief
in
Maggie
's
stories
about
the
live
things
they
came
upon
by
accident
,
 
how
Mrs.
Earwig
had
a
wash
at
home
,
and
one
of
her
children
had
fallen
into
the
hot
copper
,
for
which
reason
she
was
running
so
fast
to
fetch
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
Tom
had
a
profound
contempt
for
this
nonsense
of
Maggie
's
,
smashing
the
earwig
at
once
as
a
superfluous
yet
easy
means
of
proving
the
entire
unreality
of
such
a
story
;
but
Lucy
,
for
the
life
of
her
,
could
not
help
fancying
there
was
something
in
it
,
and
at
all
events
thought
it
was
very
pretty
make
-
believe
.
<EOS>
So
now
the
desire
to
know
the
history
of
a
very
portly
toad
,
added
to
her
habitual
affectionateness
,
made
her
run
back
to
Maggie
and
say
,
"
Oh
,
there
is
such
a
big
,
funny
toad
,
Maggie
!
<EOS>
Do
come
and
see
!
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
said
nothing
,
but
turned
away
from
her
with
a
deeper
frown
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
Tom
seemed
to
prefer
Lucy
to
her
,
Lucy
made
part
of
his
unkindness
.
<EOS>
Maggie
would
have
thought
a
little
while
ago
that
she
could
never
be
cross
with
pretty
little
Lucy
,
any
more
than
she
could
be
cruel
to
a
little
white
mouse
;
but
then
,
Tom
had
always
been
quite
indifferent
to
Lucy
before
,
and
it
had
been
left
to
Maggie
to
pet
and
make
much
of
her
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
she
was
actually
beginning
to
think
that
she
should
like
to
make
Lucy
cry
by
slapping
or
pinching
her
,
especially
as
it
might
vex
Tom
,
whom
it
was
of
no
use
to
slap
,
even
if
she
dared
,
because
he
did
n't
mind
it
.
<EOS>
And
if
Lucy
had
n't
been
there
,
Maggie
was
sure
he
would
have
got
friends
with
her
sooner
.
  
<EOS>
Tickling
a
fat
toad
who
is
not
highly
sensitive
is
an
amusement
that
it
is
possible
to
exhaust
,
and
Tom
by
and
by
began
to
look
round
for
some
other
mode
of
passing
the
time
.
<EOS>
But
in
so
prim
a
garden
,
where
they
were
not
to
go
off
the
paved
walks
,
there
was
not
a
great
choice
of
sport
.
<EOS>
The
only
great
pleasure
such
a
restriction
suggested
was
the
pleasure
of
breaking
it
,
and
Tom
began
to
meditate
an
insurrectionary
visit
to
the
pond
,
about
a
field
's
length
beyond
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Lucy
,
"
he
began
,
nodding
his
head
up
and
down
with
great
significance
,
as
he
coiled
up
his
string
again
,
"
what
do
you
think
I
mean
to
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
Tom
?
"
said
Lucy
,
with
curiosity
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
go
to
the
pond
and
look
at
the
pike
.
<EOS>
You
may
go
with
me
if
you
like
,
"
said
the
young
sultan
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Tom
,
_
dare
_
you
?
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Aunt
said
we
must
n't
go
out
of
the
garden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
shall
go
out
at
the
other
end
of
the
garden
,
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
Nobody
"
ull
see
us
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
do
n't
care
if
they
do
,
 
I
'll
run
off
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
_
I
_
could
n't
run
,
"
said
Lucy
,
who
had
never
before
been
exposed
to
such
severe
temptation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
never
mind
;
they
wo
n't
be
cross
with
_
you
_
,
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
say
I
took
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
walked
along
,
and
Lucy
trotted
by
his
side
,
timidly
enjoying
the
rare
treat
of
doing
something
naughty
,
 
excited
also
by
the
mention
of
that
celebrity
,
the
pike
,
about
which
she
was
quite
uncertain
whether
it
was
a
fish
or
a
fowl
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
saw
them
leaving
the
garden
,
and
could
not
resist
the
impulse
to
follow
.
<EOS>
Anger
and
jealousy
can
no
more
bear
to
lose
sight
of
their
objects
than
love
,
and
that
Tom
and
Lucy
should
do
or
see
anything
of
which
she
was
ignorant
would
have
been
an
intolerable
idea
to
Maggie
.
<EOS>
So
she
kept
a
few
yards
behind
them
,
unobserved
by
Tom
,
who
was
presently
absorbed
in
watching
for
the
pike
,
 
a
highly
interesting
monster
;
he
was
said
to
be
so
very
old
,
so
very
large
,
and
to
have
such
a
remarkable
appetite
.
<EOS>
The
pike
,
like
other
celebrities
,
did
not
show
when
he
was
watched
for
,
but
Tom
caught
sight
of
something
in
rapid
movement
in
the
water
,
which
attracted
him
to
another
spot
on
the
brink
of
the
pond
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
Lucy
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
in
a
loud
whisper
,
"
come
here
!
<EOS>
take
care
!
<EOS>
keep
on
the
grass
!
 
<EOS>
do
n't
step
where
the
cows
have
been
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
pointing
to
a
peninsula
of
dry
grass
,
with
trodden
mud
on
each
side
of
it
;
for
Tom
's
contemptuous
conception
of
a
girl
included
the
attribute
of
being
unfit
to
walk
in
dirty
places
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
came
carefully
as
she
was
bidden
,
and
bent
down
to
look
at
what
seemed
a
golden
arrow
-
head
darting
through
the
water
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
water
-
snake
,
Tom
told
her
;
and
Lucy
at
last
could
see
the
serpentine
wave
of
its
body
,
very
much
wondering
that
a
snake
could
swim
.
<EOS>
Maggie
had
drawn
nearer
and
nearer
;
she
_
must
_
see
it
too
,
though
it
was
bitter
to
her
,
like
everything
else
,
since
Tom
did
not
care
about
her
seeing
it
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
was
close
by
Lucy
;
and
Tom
,
who
had
been
aware
of
her
approach
,
but
would
not
notice
it
till
he
was
obliged
,
turned
round
and
said
,
    
"
Now
,
get
away
,
Maggie
;
there
's
no
room
for
you
on
the
grass
here
.
<EOS>
Nobody
asked
_
you
_
to
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
were
passions
at
war
in
Maggie
at
that
moment
to
have
made
a
tragedy
,
if
tragedies
were
made
by
passion
only
;
but
the
essential
[
Greek
text
]
which
was
present
in
the
passion
was
wanting
to
the
action
;
the
utmost
Maggie
could
do
,
with
a
fierce
thrust
of
her
small
brown
arm
,
was
to
push
poor
little
pink
-
and
-
white
Lucy
into
the
cow
-
trodden
mud
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Tom
could
not
restrain
himself
,
and
gave
Maggie
two
smart
slaps
on
the
arm
as
he
ran
to
pick
up
Lucy
,
who
lay
crying
helplessly
.
<EOS>
Maggie
retreated
to
the
roots
of
a
tree
a
few
yards
off
,
and
looked
on
impenitently
.
<EOS>
Usually
her
repentance
came
quickly
after
one
rash
deed
,
but
now
Tom
and
Lucy
had
made
her
so
miserable
,
she
was
glad
to
spoil
their
happiness
,
 
glad
to
make
everybody
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
Why
should
she
be
sorry
?
<EOS>
Tom
was
very
slow
to
forgive
_
her
_
,
however
sorry
she
might
have
been
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
tell
mother
,
you
know
,
Miss
Mag
,
"
said
Tom
,
loudly
and
emphatically
,
as
soon
as
Lucy
was
up
and
ready
to
walk
away
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
Tom
's
practice
to
"
tell
,
"
but
here
justice
clearly
demanded
that
Maggie
should
be
visited
with
the
utmost
punishment
;
not
that
Tom
had
learned
to
put
his
views
in
that
abstract
form
;
he
never
mentioned
"
justice
,
"
and
had
no
idea
that
his
desire
to
punish
might
be
called
by
that
fine
name
.
<EOS>
Lucy
was
too
entirely
absorbed
by
the
evil
that
had
befallen
her
,
 
the
spoiling
of
her
pretty
best
clothes
,
and
the
discomfort
of
being
wet
and
dirty
,
 
to
think
much
of
the
cause
,
which
was
entirely
mysterious
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
never
have
guessed
what
she
had
done
to
make
Maggie
angry
with
her
;
but
she
felt
that
Maggie
was
very
unkind
and
disagreeable
,
and
made
no
magnanimous
entreaties
to
Tom
that
he
would
not
"
tell
,
"
only
running
along
by
his
side
and
crying
piteously
,
while
Maggie
sat
on
the
roots
of
the
tree
and
looked
after
them
with
her
small
Medusa
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sally
,
"
said
Tom
,
when
they
reached
the
kitchen
door
,
and
Sally
looked
at
them
in
speechless
amaze
,
with
a
piece
of
bread
-
and
-
butter
in
her
mouth
and
a
toasting
-
fork
in
her
hand
,
 
<EOS>
"
Sally
,
tell
mother
it
was
Maggie
pushed
Lucy
into
the
mud
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Lors
ha
'
massy
,
how
did
you
get
near
such
mud
as
that
?
"
said
Sally
,
making
a
wry
face
,
as
she
stooped
down
and
examined
the
_
corpus
delicti
_
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
's
imagination
had
not
been
rapid
and
capacious
enough
to
include
this
question
among
the
foreseen
consequences
,
but
it
was
no
sooner
put
than
he
foresaw
whither
it
tended
,
and
that
Maggie
would
not
be
considered
the
only
culprit
in
the
case
.
<EOS>
He
walked
quietly
away
from
the
kitchen
door
,
leaving
Sally
to
that
pleasure
of
guessing
which
active
minds
notoriously
prefer
to
ready
-
made
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
Sally
,
as
you
are
aware
,
lost
no
time
in
presenting
Lucy
at
the
parlor
door
,
for
to
have
<EOS>
so
dirty
an
object
introduced
into
the
house
at
Garum
Firs
was
too
great
a
weight
to
be
sustained
by
a
single
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Goodness
gracious
!
"
<EOS>
aunt
Pullet
exclaimed
,
after
preluding
by
an
inarticulate
scream
;
"
keep
her
at
the
door
,
Sally
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
bring
her
off
the
oil
-
cloth
,
whatever
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
she
's
tumbled
into
some
nasty
mud
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
going
up
to
Lucy
to
examine
into
the
amount
of
damage
to
clothes
for
which
she
felt
herself
responsible
to
her
sister
Deane
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
"
um
,
it
was
Miss
Maggie
as
pushed
her
in
,
"
said
Sally
;
"
Master
Tom
's
been
and
said
so
,
and
they
must
ha
'
been
to
the
pond
<EOS>
,
for
it
's
only
there
<EOS>
they
could
ha
'
got
into
such
dirt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
it
is
,
Bessy
;
it
's
what
I
've
been
telling
you
,
"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
in
a
tone
of
prophetic
sadness
;
"
it
's
your
children
,
 
<EOS>
there
's
no
knowing
what
they
'll
come
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
mute
,
feeling
herself
a
truly
wretched
mother
.
<EOS>
As
usual
,
the
thought
pressed
upon
her
that
people
would
think
she
had
done
something
wicked
to
deserve
her
maternal
troubles
,
while
Mrs.
Pullet
began
to
give
elaborate
directions
to
Sally
how
to
guard
the
premises
from
serious
injury
in
the
course
of
removing
the
dirt
.
<EOS>
Meantime
tea
was
to
be
brought
in
by
the
cook
,
and
the
two
naughty
children
were
to
have
theirs
in
an
ignominious
manner
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
went
out
to
speak
to
these
naughty
children
,
supposing
them
to
be
close
at
hand
;
but
it
was
not
until
after
some
search
that
she
found
Tom
leaning
with
rather
a
hardened
,
careless
air
against
the
white
paling
of
the
poultry
-
yard
,
and
lowering
his
piece
of
string
on
the
other
side
as
a
means
of
exasperating
the
turkey
-
cock
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
you
naughty
boy
,
where
's
your
sister
?
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
in
a
distressed
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Tom
;
his
eagerness
for
justice
on
Maggie
had
diminished
since
he
had
seen
clearly
that
it
could
hardly
be
brought
about
without
the
injustice
of
some
blame
on
his
own
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
where
did
you
leave
her
?
"
said
the
mother
,
looking
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sitting
under
the
tree
,
against
the
pond
,
"
said
Tom
,
apparently
indifferent
to
everything
but
the
string
and
the
turkey
-
cock
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
go
and
fetch
her
in
this
minute
,
you
naughty
boy
.
<EOS>
And
how
could
you
think
o
'
going
to
the
pond
,
and
taking
your
sister
where
there
was
dirt
?
<EOS>
You
know
she
'll
do
mischief
if
there
's
mischief
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
way
,
if
she
blamed
Tom
,
to
refer
his
misdemeanor
,
somehow
or
other
,
to
Maggie
.
  
<EOS>
The
idea
of
Maggie
sitting
alone
by
the
pond
roused
an
habitual
fear
in
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
mind
,
and
she
mounted
the
horse
-
block
to
satisfy
herself
by
a
sight
of
that
fatal
child
,
while
Tom
walked
 
not
very
quickly
 
on
his
way
toward
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
such
children
for
the
water
,
mine
are
,
"
she
said
aloud
,
without
reflecting
that
there
was
no
one
to
hear
her
;
"
they
'll
be
brought
in
dead
and
drownded
some
day
.
<EOS>
I
wish
that
river
was
far
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
when
she
not
only
failed
to
discern
Maggie
,
but
presently
saw
Tom
returning
from
the
pool
alone
,
this
hovering
fear
entered
and
took
complete
possession
of
her
,
and
she
hurried
to
meet
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
's
nowhere
about
the
pond
,
mother
,
"
said
Tom
;
"
she
's
gone
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
You
may
conceive
the
terrified
search
for
Maggie
,
and
the
difficulty
of
convincing
her
mother
that
she
was
not
in
the
pond
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pullet
observed
that
the
child
might
come
to
a
worse
end
<EOS>
if
she
lived
,
there
was
no
knowing
;
and
Mr.
Pullet
,
confused
and
overwhelmed
by
this
revolutionary
aspect
of
things
,
 
the
tea
deferred
and
the
poultry
alarmed
by
the
unusual
running
to
and
fro
,
 
took
up
his
spud
as
an
instrument
of
search
,
and
reached
down
a
key
to
unlock
the
goose
-
pen
,
as
a
likely
place
for
Maggie
to
lie
concealed
in
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
,
after
a
while
,
started
the
idea
that
Maggie
was
gone
home
(
without
thinking
it
necessary
to
state
that
it
was
what
he
should
have
done
himself
under
the
circumstances
)
,
and
the
suggestion
was
seized
as
a
comfort
by
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sister
,
for
goodness
'
sake
let
'em
put
the
horse
in
the
carriage
and
take
me
home
;
we
shall
perhaps
find
her
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
Lucy
ca
n't
walk
in
her
dirty
clothes
,
"
she
said
,
looking
at
that
innocent
victim
,
who
was
wrapped
up
in
a
shawl
,
and
sitting
with
naked
feet
on
the
sofa
.
  
<EOS>
Aunt
Pullet
was
quite
willing
to
take
the
shortest
means
of
restoring
her
premises
to
order
and
quiet
,
and
it
was
not
long
before
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
in
the
chaise
,
looking
anxiously
at
the
most
distant
point
before
her
.
<EOS>
What
the
father
would
say
if
Maggie
was
lost
,
was
a
question
that
predominated
over
every
other
.
    
<EOS>
Maggie
Tries
to
Run
away
from
Her
Shadow
  
Maggie
's
intentions
,
as
usual
,
were
on
a
larger
scale
than
Tom
imagined
.
<EOS>
The
resolution
that
gathered
in
her
mind
,
after
Tom
and
Lucy
had
walked
away
,
was
not
so
simple
as
that
of
going
home
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
she
would
run
away
and
go
to
the
gypsies
,
and
Tom
should
never
see
her
any
more
.
<EOS>
That
was
by
no
means
a
new
idea
to
Maggie
;
she
had
been
so
often
told
she
was
like
a
gypsy
,
and
"
half
wild
,
"
that
when
she
was
miserable
it
seemed
to
her
the
only
way
of
escaping
opprobrium
,
and
being
entirely
in
harmony
with
circumstances
,
would
be
to
live
in
a
little
brown
tent
on
the
commons
;
the
gypsies
,
she
considered
,
would
gladly
receive
her
and
pay
her
much
respect
on
account
of
her
superior
knowledge
.
<EOS>
She
had
once
mentioned
her
views
on
this
point
to
Tom
and
suggested
that
he
should
stain
his
face
brown
,
and
they
should
run
away
together
;
but
Tom
rejected
the
scheme
with
contempt
,
observing
that
gypsies
were
thieves
,
and
hardly
got
anything
to
eat
and
had
nothing
to
drive
but
a
donkey
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
however
,
Maggie
thought
her
misery
had
reached
a
pitch
at
which
gypsydom
was
her
refuge
,
and
she
rose
from
her
seat
on
the
roots
of
the
tree
with
the
sense
that
this
was
a
great
crisis
in
her
life
;
she
would
run
straight
away
till
she
came
to
Dunlow
Common
,
where
there
would
certainly
be
gypsies
;
and
cruel
Tom
,
and
the
rest
of
her
relations
who
found
fault
with
her
,
should
never
see
her
any
more
.
<EOS>
She
thought
of
her
father
as
she
ran
along
,
but
she
reconciled
herself
to
the
idea
of
parting
with
him
,
by
determining
that
she
would
secretly
send
him
a
letter
by
a
small
gypsy
,
who
would
run
away
without
telling
where
she
was
,
and
just
let
him
know
that
she
was
well
and
happy
,
and
always
loved
him
very
much
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
soon
got
out
of
breath
with
running
,
but
by
the
time
Tom
got
to
the
pond
again
she
was
at
the
distance
of
three
long
fields
,
and
was
on
the
edge
of
the
lane
leading
to
the
highroad
.
<EOS>
She
stopped
to
pant
a
little
,
reflecting
that
running
away
was
not
a
pleasant
thing
until
one
had
got
quite
to
the
common
where
the
gypsies
were
,
but
her
resolution
had
not
abated
;
she
presently
passed
through
the
gate
into
the
lane
,
not
knowing
where
it
would
lead
her
,
for
it
was
not
this
way
that
they
came
from
Dorlcote
Mill
to
Garum
Firs
,
and
she
felt
all
the
safer
for
that
,
because
there
was
no
chance
of
her
being
overtaken
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
soon
aware
,
not
without
trembling
,
that
there
were
two
men
coming
along
the
lane
in
front
of
her
;
she
had
not
thought
of
meeting
strangers
,
she
had
been
too
much
occupied
with
the
idea
of
her
friends
coming
after
her
.
<EOS>
The
formidable
strangers
were
two
shabby
-
looking
men
with
flushed
faces
,
one
of
them
carrying
a
bundle
on
a
stick
over
his
shoulder
;
but
to
her
surprise
,
while
she
was
dreading
their
disapprobation
as
a
runaway
,
the
man
with
the
bundle
stopped
,
and
in
a
half
-
whining
,
half
-
coaxing
tone
asked
her
if
she
had
a
copper
to
give
a
poor
man
.
<EOS>
Maggie
had
a
sixpence
in
her
pocket
,
 
her
uncle
Glegg
's
present
,
 
which
she
immediately
drew
out
and
gave
this
poor
man
with
a
polite
smile
,
hoping
he
would
feel
very
kindly
toward
her
as
a
generous
person
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
only
money
I
've
got
,
"
she
said
apologetically
.
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
little
miss
,
"
said
the
man
,
in
a
less
respectful
and
grateful
tone
than
Maggie
anticipated
,
and
she
even
observed
that
he
smiled
and
winked
at
his
companion
.
<EOS>
She
walked
on
hurriedly
,
but
was
aware
that
the
two
men
were
standing
still
,
probably
to
look
after
her
,
and
she
presently
heard
them
laughing
loudly
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
it
occurred
to
her
that
they
might
think
she
was
an
idiot
;
Tom
had
said
that
her
cropped
hair
made
her
look
like
an
idiot
,
and
it
was
too
painful
an
idea
to
be
readily
forgotten
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
she
had
no
sleeves
on
,
 
only
a
cape
and
bonnet
.
<EOS>
It
was
clear
that
she
was
not
likely
to
make
a
favorable
impression
on
passengers
,
and
she
thought
she
would
turn
into
the
fields
again
,
but
not
on
the
same
side
of
the
lane
as
before
,
lest
they
should
still
be
uncle
Pullet
's
fields
.
<EOS>
She
turned
through
the
first
gate
that
was
not
locked
,
and
felt
a
delightful
sense
of
privacy
in
creeping
along
by
the
hedgerows
,
after
her
recent
humiliating
encounter
.
<EOS>
She
was
used
to
wandering
about
the
fields
by
herself
,
and
was
less
timid
there
than
on
the
highroad
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
she
had
to
climb
over
high
gates
,
but
that
was
a
small
evil
;
she
was
getting
out
of
reach
very
fast
,
and
she
should
probably
soon
come
within
sight
of
Dunlow
Common
,
or
at
least
of
some
other
common
,
for
she
had
heard
her
father
say
that
you
could
n't
go
very
far
without
coming
to
a
common
.
<EOS>
She
hoped
so
,
for
she
was
getting
rather
tired
and
hungry
,
and
until
she
reached
the
gypsies
<EOS>
there
was
no
definite
prospect
of
bread
and
butter
.
<EOS>
It
was
still
broad
daylight
,
for
aunt
Pullet
,
retaining
the
early
habits
of
the
Dodson
family
,
took
tea
at
half
-
past
four
by
the
sun
,
and
at
five
by
the
kitchen
clock
;
so
,
though
it
was
nearly
an
hour
since
Maggie
started
,
there
was
no
gathering
gloom
on
the
fields
to
remind
her
that
the
night
would
come
.
<EOS>
Still
,
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
been
walking
a
very
great
distance
indeed
,
and
it
was
really
surprising
that
the
common
did
not
come
within
sight
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
<EOS>
she
had
been
in
the
rich
parish
of
Garum
,
where
was
a
great
deal
of
pasture
-
land
,
and
she
had
only
seen
one
laborer
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
That
was
fortunate
in
some
respects
,
as
laborers
might
be
too
ignorant
to
understand
the
propriety
of
her
wanting
to
go
to
Dunlow
Common
;
yet
it
would
have
been
better
if
she
could
have
met
some
one
who
would
tell
her
the
way
without
wanting
to
know
anything
about
her
private
business
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
however
,
the
green
fields
came
to
an
end
,
and
Maggie
found
herself
looking
through
the
bars
of
a
gate
into
a
lane
with
a
wide
margin
of
grass
on
each
side
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
seen
such
a
wide
lane
before
,
and
,
without
her
knowing
why
,
it
gave
her
the
impression
that
the
common
could
not
be
far
off
;
perhaps
it
was
because
she
saw
a
donkey
with
a
log
to
his
foot
feeding
on
the
grassy
margin
,
for
she
had
seen
a
donkey
with
that
pitiable
encumbrance
on
Dunlow
Common
when
she
had
been
across
it
in
her
father
's
gig
.
<EOS>
She
crept
through
the
bars
of
the
gate
and
walked
on
with
new
spirit
,
though
not
without
haunting
images
of
Apollyon
,
and
a
highwayman
with
a
pistol
,
and
a
blinking
dwarf
in
yellow
with
a
mouth
from
ear
to
ear
,
and
other
miscellaneous
dangers
.
<EOS>
For
poor
little
Maggie
had
at
once
the
timidity
of
an
active
imagination
and
the
daring
that
comes
from
overmastering
impulse
.
<EOS>
She
had
rushed
into
the
adventure
of
seeking
her
unknown
kindred
,
the
gypsies
;
and
now
she
was
in
this
strange
lane
,
she
hardly
dared
look
on
one
side
of
her
,
lest
she
should
see
the
diabolical
blacksmith
in
his
leathern
apron
grinning
at
her
with
arms
akimbo
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
without
a
leaping
of
the
heart
that
she
caught
sight
of
a
small
pair
of
bare
legs
sticking
up
,
feet
uppermost
,
by
the
side
of
a
hillock
;
they
seemed
something
hideously
preternatural
,
 
a
diabolical
kind
of
fungus
;
for
she
was
too
much
agitated
at
the
first
glance
to
see
the
ragged
clothes
and
the
dark
shaggy
head
attached
to
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
boy
asleep
,
and
Maggie
trotted
along
faster
and
more
lightly
,
lest
she
should
wake
him
;
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
he
was
one
of
her
friends
the
gypsies
,
who
in
all
probability
would
have
very
genial
manners
.
<EOS>
But
the
fact
was
so
,
for
at
the
next
bend
in
the
lane
Maggie
actually
saw
the
little
semicircular
black
tent
with
the
blue
smoke
rising
before
it
,
which
was
to
be
her
refuge
from
all
the
blighting
obloquy
that
had
pursued
her
in
civilized
life
.
<EOS>
She
even
saw
a
tall
female
figure
by
the
column
of
smoke
,
doubtless
the
gypsy
-
mother
,
who
provided
the
tea
and
other
groceries
;
it
was
astonishing
to
herself
that
she
did
not
feel
more
delighted
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
startling
to
find
the
gypsies
in
a
lane
,
after
all
,
and
not
on
a
common
;
indeed
,
it
was
rather
disappointing
;
for
a
mysterious
illimitable
common
,
where
there
were
sand
-
pits
to
hide
in
,
and
one
was
out
of
everybody
's
reach
,
had
always
made
part
of
Maggie
's
picture
of
gypsy
life
.
<EOS>
She
went
on
,
however
,
and
thought
with
some
comfort
that
gypsies
most
likely
knew
nothing
about
idiots
,
so
there
was
no
danger
of
their
falling
into
the
mistake
of
setting
her
down
at
the
first
glance
as
an
idiot
.
<EOS>
It
was
plain
she
had
attracted
attention
;
for
the
tall
figure
,
who
proved
to
be
a
young
woman
with
a
baby
on
her
arm
,
walked
slowly
to
meet
her
.
<EOS>
Maggie
looked
up
in
the
new
face
rather
tremblingly
as
it
approached
,
and
was
reassured
by
the
thought
that
her
aunt
Pullet
and
the
rest
were
right
when
they
called
her
a
gypsy
;
for
this
face
,
with
the
bright
dark
eyes
and
the
long
hair
,
was
really
something
like
what
she
used
to
see
in
the
glass
before
she
cut
her
hair
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
little
lady
,
where
are
you
going
to
?
"
<EOS>
the
gypsy
said
,
in
a
tone
of
coaxing
deference
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
delightful
,
and
just
what
Maggie
expected
;
the
gypsies
saw
at
once
that
she
was
a
little
lady
,
and
were
prepared
to
treat
her
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
any
farther
,
"
said
Maggie
,
feeling
as
if
she
were
saying
what
she
had
rehearsed
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
come
to
stay
with
_
<EOS>
you
_
,
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
pretty
;
come
,
then
.
<EOS>
Why
,
what
a
nice
little
lady
you
are
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
gypsy
,
taking
her
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
Maggie
thought
her
very
agreeable
,
but
wished
she
had
not
been
so
dirty
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
quite
a
group
round
the
fire
when
she
reached
it
.
<EOS>
An
old
gypsy
woman
was
seated
on
the
ground
nursing
her
knees
,
and
occasionally
poking
a
skewer
into
the
round
kettle
that
sent
forth
an
odorous
steam
;
two
small
shock
-
headed
children
were
lying
prone
and
resting
on
their
elbows
something
like
small
sphinxes
;
and
a
placid
donkey
was
bending
his
head
over
a
tall
girl
,
who
,
lying
on
her
back
,
was
scratching
his
nose
and
indulging
him
with
a
bite
of
excellent
stolen
hay
.
<EOS>
The
slanting
sunlight
fell
kindly
upon
them
,
and
the
scene
was
really
very
pretty
and
comfortable
<EOS>
,
Maggie
thought
,
only
she
hoped
they
would
soon
set
out
the
tea
-
cups
.
<EOS>
Everything
would
be
quite
charming
when
she
had
taught
the
gypsies
to
use
a
washing
-
basin
,
and
to
feel
an
interest
in
books
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
confusing
,
though
,
that
the
young
woman
began
to
speak
to
the
old
one
in
a
language
which
Maggie
did
not
understand
,
while
the
tall
girl
,
who
was
feeding
the
donkey
,
sat
up
and
stared
at
her
without
offering
any
salutation
.
<EOS>
At
last
the
old
woman
said
,
    
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
my
pretty
lady
,
are
you
come
to
stay
with
us
?
<EOS>
Sit
ye
down
and
tell
us
where
you
come
from
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
just
like
a
story
;
Maggie
liked
to
be
called
pretty
lady
and
treated
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
She
sat
down
and
said
,
    
"
I
'm
come
from
home
because
I
'm
unhappy
,
and
I
mean
to
be
a
gypsy
.
<EOS>
I
'll
live
with
you
if
you
like
,
and
I
can
teach
you
a
great
many
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Such
a
clever
little
lady
,
"
said
the
woman
with
the
baby
sitting
down
by
Maggie
,
and
allowing
baby
to
crawl
;
"
and
such
a
pretty
bonnet
and
frock
,
"
she
added
,
taking
off
Maggie
's
bonnet
and
looking
at
it
while
she
made
an
observation
to
the
old
woman
,
in
the
unknown
language
.
<EOS>
The
tall
girl
snatched
the
bonnet
and
put
it
on
her
own
head
hind
-
foremost
with
a
grin
;
but
Maggie
was
determined
not
to
show
any
weakness
on
this
subject
,
as
if
she
were
susceptible
about
her
bonnet
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
wear
a
bonnet
,
"
she
said
;
"
I
'd
rather
wear
a
red
handkerchief
,
like
yours
"
(
looking
at
her
friend
by
her
side
)
.
<EOS>
"
My
hair
was
quite
long
till
yesterday
,
when
I
cut
it
off
;
but
I
dare
say
it
will
grow
again
very
soon
,
"
she
added
apologetically
,
thinking
it
probable
the
gypsies
had
a
strong
prejudice
in
favor
of
long
hair
.
<EOS>
And
Maggie
had
forgotten
even
her
hunger
at
that
moment
in
the
desire
to
conciliate
gypsy
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
a
nice
little
lady
!
 
<EOS>
and
rich
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
said
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
you
live
in
a
beautiful
house
at
home
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
home
is
pretty
,
and
I
'm
very
fond
of
the
river
,
where
we
go
fishing
,
but
I
'm
often
very
unhappy
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
liked
to
bring
my
books
with
me
,
but
I
came
away
in
a
hurry
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
tell
you
almost
everything
there
is
in
my
books
<EOS>
,
I
've
read
them
so
many
times
,
and
that
will
amuse
you
.
<EOS>
And
I
can
tell
you
something
about
Geography
too
,
 
<EOS>
that
's
about
the
world
we
live
in
,
 
very
useful
and
interesting
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
hear
about
Columbus
?
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
eyes
had
begun
to
sparkle
and
her
cheeks
to
flush
,
 
she
was
really
beginning
to
instruct
the
gypsies
,
and
gaining
great
influence
over
them
.
<EOS>
The
gypsies
themselves
were
not
without
amazement
at
this
talk
,
though
their
attention
was
divided
by
the
contents
of
Maggie
's
pocket
,
which
the
friend
at
her
right
hand
had
by
this
time
emptied
without
attracting
her
notice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
where
you
live
,
my
little
lady
?
"
said
the
old
woman
,
at
the
mention
of
Columbus
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
!
"
said
Maggie
,
with
some
pity
;
"
Columbus
was
a
very
wonderful
man
,
who
found
out
half
the
world
,
and
they
put
chains
on
him
and
treated
him
very
badly
,
you
know
;
it
's
in
my
Catechism
of
Geography
,
but
perhaps
it
's
rather
too
long
to
tell
before
tea
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
want
my
tea
<EOS>
so
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
last
words
burst
from
Maggie
,
in
spite
of
herself
,
with
a
sudden
drop
from
patronizing
instruction
to
simple
peevishness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
she
's
hungry
,
poor
little
lady
,
"
said
the
younger
woman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Give
her
some
o
'
the
cold
victual
.
<EOS>
You
've
been
walking
a
good
way
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Where
's
your
home
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
Dorlcote
Mill
,
a
good
way
off
,
"
said
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
is
Mr.
Tulliver
,
but
we
must
n't
let
him
know
where
I
am
,
else
he
'll
fetch
me
home
again
.
<EOS>
Where
does
the
queen
of
the
gypsies
live
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
do
you
want
to
go
to
her
,
my
little
lady
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
younger
woman
.
<EOS>
The
tall
girl
meanwhile
was
constantly
staring
at
Maggie
and
grinning
.
<EOS>
Her
manners
were
certainly
not
agreeable
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Maggie
,
"
I
'm
only
thinking
that
if
she
is
n't
a
very
good
queen
you
might
be
glad
when
she
died
,
and
you
could
choose
another
.
<EOS>
If
I
was
a
queen
,
I
'd
be
a
very
good
queen
,
and
kind
to
everybody
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
bit
o
'
<EOS>
nice
victual
,
then
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
handing
to
Maggie
a
lump
of
dry
bread
,
which
she
had
taken
from
a
bag
of
scraps
,
and
a
piece
of
cold
bacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Maggie
,
looking
at
the
food
without
taking
it
;
"
but
will
you
give
me
some
bread
-
and
-
butter
and
tea
instead
<EOS>
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
bacon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
've
got
no
tea
nor
butter
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
with
something
like
a
scowl
,
as
if
she
were
getting
tired
of
coaxing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
a
little
bread
and
treacle
would
do
,
"
said
Maggie
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
han't
got
no
treacle
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
crossly
,
whereupon
there
followed
a
sharp
dialogue
between
the
two
women
in
their
unknown
tongue
,
and
one
of
the
small
sphinxes
snatched
at
the
bread
-
and
-
bacon
,
and
began
to
eat
it
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
tall
girl
,
who
had
gone
a
few
yards
off
,
came
back
,
and
said
something
which
produced
a
strong
effect
.
<EOS>
The
old
woman
,
seeming
to
forget
Maggie
's
hunger
,
poked
the
skewer
into
the
pot
with
new
vigor
,
and
the
younger
crept
under
the
tent
and
reached
out
some
platters
and
spoons
.
<EOS>
Maggie
trembled
a
little
,
and
was
afraid
the
tears
would
come
into
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
tall
girl
gave
a
shrill
cry
,
and
presently
came
running
up
the
boy
whom
Maggie
had
passed
as
he
was
sleeping
,
 
a
rough
urchin
about
the
age
of
Tom
.
<EOS>
He
stared
at
Maggie
,
and
there
ensued
much
incomprehensible
chattering
.
<EOS>
She
felt
very
lonely
,
and
was
quite
sure
she
should
begin
to
cry
before
long
;
the
gypsies
did
n't
seem
to
mind
her
at
all
,
and
she
felt
quite
weak
among
them
.
<EOS>
But
the
springing
tears
were
checked
by
new
terror
,
when
two
men
came
up
,
whose
approach
had
been
the
cause
of
the
sudden
excitement
.
<EOS>
The
elder
of
the
two
carried
a
bag
,
which
he
flung
down
,
addressing
the
women
in
a
loud
and
scolding
tone
,
which
they
answered
by
a
shower
of
treble
sauciness
;
while
a
black
cur
ran
barking
up
to
Maggie
,
and
threw
her
into
a
tremor
that
only
found
a
new
cause
in
the
curses
with
which
the
younger
man
called
the
dog
off
,
and
gave
him
a
rap
with
a
great
stick
he
held
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
felt
that
it
was
impossible
she
should
ever
be
queen
of
these
people
,
or
ever
communicate
to
them
amusing
and
useful
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
Both
the
men
now
seemed
to
be
inquiring
about
Maggie
,
for
they
looked
at
her
,
and
the
tone
of
the
conversation
became
of
that
pacific
kind
which
implies
curiosity
on
one
side
and
the
power
of
satisfying
it
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
At
last
the
younger
woman
said
in
her
previous
deferential
,
coaxing
tone
,
    
"
This
nice
little
lady
's
come
to
live
with
us
;
are
n't
you
glad
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
very
glad
,
"
said
the
younger
man
,
who
was
looking
at
Maggie
's
silver
thimble
and
other
small
matters
that
had
been
taken
from
her
pocket
.
<EOS>
He
returned
them
all
except
the
thimble
to
the
younger
woman
,
with
some
observation
,
and
she
immediately
restored
them
to
Maggie
's
pocket
,
while
the
men
seated
themselves
,
and
began
to
attack
the
contents
of
the
kettle
,
 
a
stew
of
meat
and
potatoes
,
 
which
had
been
taken
off
the
fire
and
turned
out
into
a
yellow
platter
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
began
to
think
that
Tom
must
be
right
about
the
gypsies
;
they
must
certainly
be
thieves
,
unless
the
man
meant
to
return
her
thimble
by
and
by
.
<EOS>
She
would
willingly
have
given
it
to
him
,
for
she
was
not
at
all
attached
to
her
thimble
;
but
the
idea
that
she
was
among
thieves
prevented
her
from
feeling
any
comfort
in
the
revival
of
deference
and
attention
toward
her
;
all
thieves
,
except
Robin
Hood
,
were
wicked
people
.
<EOS>
The
women
saw
she
was
frightened
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
've
got
nothing
nice
for
a
lady
to
eat
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
in
her
coaxing
tone
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
's
so
hungry
,
sweet
little
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
my
dear
,
try
if
you
can
eat
a
bit
<EOS>
o
'
this
,
"
said
the
younger
woman
,
handing
some
of
the
stew
on
a
brown
dish
with
an
iron
spoon
to
Maggie
,
who
,
remembering
that
the
old
woman
had
seemed
angry
with
her
for
not
liking
the
bread
-
and
-
bacon
,
dared
not
refuse
the
stew
,
though
fear
had
chased
away
her
appetite
.
<EOS>
If
her
father
would
but
come
by
in
the
gig
and
take
her
up
!
<EOS>
Or
even
if
Jack
the
Giantkiller
,
or
Mr.
Greatheart
,
or
St.
George
who
slew
the
dragon
on
the
half
-
pennies
,
would
happen
to
pass
that
way
!
<EOS>
But
Maggie
thought
with
a
sinking
heart
that
these
heroes
were
never
seen
in
the
neighborhood
of
St.
Ogg
's
;
nothing
very
wonderful
ever
came
there
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
Tulliver
,
you
perceive
,
was
by
no
means
that
well
trained
,
well
-
informed
young
person
that
a
small
female
of
eight
or
nine
necessarily
is
in
these
days
<EOS>
;
she
had
only
been
to
school
a
year
at
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
had
so
few
books
that
she
sometimes
read
the
dictionary
;
so
that
in
travelling
over
her
small
mind
you
would
have
found
the
most
unexpected
ignorance
as
well
as
unexpected
knowledge
.
<EOS>
She
could
have
informed
you
that
there
was
such
a
word
as
"
polygamy
,
"
and
being
also
acquainted
with
"
polysyllable
,
"
she
had
deduced
the
conclusion
that
"
poly
"
mean
"
many
"
;
but
she
had
had
no
idea
that
gypsies
were
not
well
supplied
with
groceries
,
and
her
thoughts
generally
were
the
oddest
mixture
of
clear
-
eyed
acumen
and
blind
dreams
.
  
<EOS>
Her
ideas
about
the
gypsies
had
undergone
a
rapid
modification
in
the
last
five
minutes
.
<EOS>
From
having
considered
them
very
respectful
companions
,
amenable
to
instruction
,
she
had
begun
to
think
that
they
meant
perhaps
to
kill
her
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
,
and
cut
up
her
body
for
gradual
cooking
;
the
suspicion
crossed
her
that
the
fierce
-
eyed
old
man
was
in
fact
the
Devil
,
who
might
drop
that
transparent
disguise
at
any
moment
,
and
turn
either
into
the
grinning
blacksmith
,
or
else
a
fiery
-
eyed
monster
with
dragon
's
wings
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
use
trying
to
eat
the
stew
,
and
yet
the
thing
she
most
dreaded
was
to
offend
the
gypsies
,
by
betraying
her
extremely
unfavorable
opinion
of
them
;
and
she
wondered
,
with
a
keenness
of
interest
that
no
theologian
could
have
exceeded
,
whether
,
if
the
Devil
were
really
present
,
he
would
know
her
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
you
do
n't
like
the
smell
of
it
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
young
woman
,
observing
that
Maggie
did
not
even
take
a
spoonful
of
the
stew
.
<EOS>
"
Try
a
bit
,
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
,
"
said
Maggie
,
summoning
all
her
force
for
a
desperate
effort
,
and
trying
to
smile
in
a
friendly
way
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
time
,
I
think
;
it
seems
getting
darker
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
must
go
home
now
,
and
come
again
another
day
,
and
then
I
can
bring
you
a
basket
with
some
jam
-
tarts
and
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
rose
from
her
seat
as
she
threw
out
this
illusory
prospect
,
devoutly
hoping
that
Apollyon
was
gullible
;
but
her
hope
sank
when
the
old
gypsy
-
woman
said
,
"
Stop
a
bit
,
stop
a
bit
,
little
lady
;
we
'll
take
you
home
,
all
safe
,
when
we
've
done
supper
;
you
shall
ride
home
,
like
a
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
sat
down
again
,
with
little
faith
in
this
promise
,
though
she
presently
saw
the
tall
girl
putting
a
bridle
on
the
donkey
,
and
throwing
a
couple
of
bags
on
his
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
then
,
little
missis
,
"
said
the
younger
man
,
rising
,
and
leading
the
donkey
forward
,
"
tell
us
where
you
live
;
what
's
the
name
<EOS>
o
'
the
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Dorlcote
Mill
is
my
home
,
"
said
Maggie
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
is
Mr.
Tulliver
;
he
lives
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
a
big
mill
a
little
way
this
side
<EOS>
o
'
St.
Ogg
's
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
far
off
?
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
like
to
walk
there
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
no
,
it
'll
be
getting
dark
,
we
must
make
haste
.
<EOS>
And
the
donkey'll
carry
you
as
nice
as
can
be
;
you
'll
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
lifted
Maggie
as
he
spoke
,
and
set
her
on
the
donkey
.
<EOS>
She
felt
relieved
that
it
was
not
the
old
man
who
seemed
to
be
going
with
her
,
but
she
had
only
a
trembling
hope
that
she
was
really
going
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
your
pretty
bonnet
,
"
said
the
younger
woman
,
putting
that
recently
despised
but
now
welcome
article
of
costume
on
Maggie
's
head
;
"
and
you
'll
say
we
've
been
very
good
to
you
,
wo
n't
you
?
<EOS>
and
what
a
nice
little
lady
<EOS>
we
said
you
was
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
thank
you
,
"
said
Maggie
,
"
I
'm
very
much
obliged
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
wish
you
'd
go
with
me
too
.
"
<EOS>
She
thought
anything
was
better
than
going
with
one
of
the
dreadful
men
alone
;
it
would
be
more
cheerful
to
be
murdered
by
a
larger
party
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
're
fondest
o
'
<EOS>
_
me
_
,
are
n't
you
?
"
said
the
woman
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
ca
n't
go
;
you
'll
go
too
fast
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
now
appeared
that
the
man
also
was
to
be
seated
on
the
donkey
,
holding
Maggie
before
him
,
and
she
was
as
incapable
of
remonstrating
against
this
arrangement
as
the
donkey
himself
,
though
no
nightmare
had
ever
seemed
to
her
more
horrible
.
<EOS>
When
the
woman
had
patted
her
on
the
back
,
and
said
"
Good
-
by
,
"
the
donkey
,
at
a
strong
hint
from
the
man
's
stick
,
set
off
at
a
rapid
walk
along
the
lane
toward
the
point
Maggie
had
come
from
an
hour
ago
,
while
the
tall
girl
and
the
rough
urchin
,
also
furnished
with
sticks
,
obligingly
escorted
them
for
the
first
hundred
yards
,
with
much
screaming
and
thwacking
.
  
<EOS>
Not
Leonore
,
in
that
preternatural
midnight
excursion
with
her
phantom
lover
,
was
more
terrified
than
poor
Maggie
in
this
entirely
natural
ride
on
a
short
-
paced
donkey
,
with
a
gypsy
behind
her
,
who
considered
that
he
was
earning
half
a
crown
.
<EOS>
The
red
light
of
the
setting
sun
seemed
to
have
a
portentous
meaning
,
with
which
the
alarming
bray
of
the
second
donkey
with
the
log
on
its
foot
must
surely
have
some
connection
.
<EOS>
Two
low
thatched
cottages
 
<EOS>
the
only
houses
they
passed
in
this
lane
 
seemed
to
add
to
its
dreariness
;
they
had
no
windows
to
speak
of
,
and
the
doors
were
closed
;
it
was
probable
that
they
were
inhabitated
by
witches
,
and
it
was
a
relief
to
find
that
the
donkey
did
not
stop
there
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
 
oh
,
sight
of
joy
!
 
<EOS>
this
lane
,
the
longest
in
the
world
,
was
coming
to
an
end
,
was
opening
on
a
broad
highroad
,
where
there
was
actually
a
coach
passing
!
<EOS>
And
there
was
a
finger
-
post
at
the
corner
,
 
<EOS>
she
had
surely
seen
that
finger
-
post
before
,
 
"
To
St.
Ogg
's
,
2
miles
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
gypsy
really
meant
to
take
her
home
,
then
;
he
was
probably
a
good
man
,
after
all
,
and
might
have
been
rather
hurt
at
the
thought
that
she
did
n't
like
coming
with
him
alone
.
<EOS>
This
idea
became
stronger
as
she
felt
more
and
more
certain
that
she
knew
the
road
quite
well
,
and
she
was
considering
how
she
might
open
a
conversation
with
the
injured
gypsy
,
and
not
only
gratify
his
feelings
but
efface
the
impression
of
her
cowardice
,
when
,
as
they
reached
a
cross
-
road
.
<EOS>
Maggie
caught
sight
of
some
one
coming
on
a
white
-
faced
horse
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
stop
,
stop
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
out
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
my
father
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
father
,
father
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
sudden
joy
was
almost
painful
,
and
before
her
father
reached
her
,
she
was
sobbing
.
<EOS>
Great
was
Mr.
Tulliver
's
wonder
,
for
he
had
made
a
round
from
Basset
,
and
had
not
yet
been
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
's
the
meaning
<EOS>
o
'
this
?
"
he
said
,
checking
his
horse
,
while
Maggie
slipped
from
the
donkey
and
ran
to
her
father
's
stirrup
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
little
miss
lost
herself
,
I
reckon
,
"
said
the
gypsy
.
<EOS>
"
She
'd
come
to
our
tent
at
the
far
end
o
'
Dunlow
Lane
,
and
I
was
bringing
her
where
she
said
her
home
was
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
good
way
to
come
after
being
on
the
tramp
all
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
father
,
he
's
been
very
good
to
bring
me
home
,
"
said
Maggie
,
 
"
a
very
kind
,
good
man
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
then
,
my
man
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
taking
out
five
shillings
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
best
day
's
work
_
you
_
ever
did
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
afford
to
lose
the
little
wench
;
here
,
lift
her
up
before
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Maggie
,
how
's
this
,
how
's
this
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
as
they
rode
along
,
while
she
laid
her
head
against
her
father
and
sobbed
.
<EOS>
"
How
came
you
to
be
rambling
about
and
lose
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
father
,
"
sobbed
Maggie
,
"
I
ran
away
because
I
was
so
unhappy
;
Tom
was
so
angry
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
bear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Pooh
,
pooh
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
soothingly
,
"
you
must
n't
think
o
'
running
away
from
father
.
<EOS>
What
'
ud
father
do
without
his
little
wench
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
I
never
will
again
,
father
 
never
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
spoke
his
mind
very
strongly
when
he
reached
home
that
evening
;
and
the
effect
was
seen
in
the
remarkable
fact
that
Maggie
never
heard
one
reproach
from
her
mother
,
or
one
taunt
from
Tom
,
about
this
foolish
business
of
her
running
away
to
the
gypsies
.
<EOS>
Maggie
was
rather
awe
-
stricken
by
this
unusual
treatment
,
and
sometimes
thought
that
her
conduct
had
been
too
wicked
to
be
alluded
to
.

order
to
see
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Glegg
at
home
,
we
must
enter
the
town
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
 
that
venerable
town
with
the
red
fluted
roofs
and
the
broad
warehouse
gables
,
where
the
black
ships
unlade
themselves
of
their
burthens
from
the
far
north
,
and
carry
away
,
in
exchange
,
the
precious
inland
products
,
the
well
-
crushed
cheese
and
the
soft
fleeces
which
my
refined
readers
have
doubtless
become
acquainted
with
through
the
medium
of
the
best
classic
pastorals
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
one
of
those
old
,
old
towns
which
impress
one
as
a
continuation
and
outgrowth
of
nature
,
as
much
as
the
nests
of
the
bower
-
birds
or
the
winding
galleries
of
the
white
ants
;
a
town
which
carries
the
traces
of
its
long
growth
and
history
like
a
millennial
tree
,
and
has
sprung
up
and
developed
in
the
same
spot
between
the
river
and
the
low
hill
from
the
time
when
the
Roman
legions
turned
their
backs
on
it
from
the
camp
on
the
hillside
,
and
the
long
-
haired
sea
-
kings
came
up
the
river
and
looked
with
fierce
,
eager
eyes
at
the
fatness
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
town
"
familiar
with
forgotten
years
.
<EOS>
"
The
shadow
of
the
Saxon
hero
-
king
still
walks
there
fitfully
,
reviewing
the
scenes
of
his
youth
and
love
-
time
,
and
is
met
by
the
gloomier
shadow
of
the
dreadful
heathen
Dane
,
who
was
stabbed
in
the
midst
of
his
warriors
by
the
sword
of
an
invisible
avenger
,
and
who
rises
on
autumn
evenings
like
a
white
mist
from
his
tumulus
on
the
hill
,
and
hovers
in
the
court
of
the
old
hall
by
the
river
-
side
,
the
spot
where
he
was
thus
miraculously
slain
in
the
days
before
the
old
hall
was
built
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
Normans
who
began
to
build
that
fine
old
hall
,
which
is
,
like
the
town
,
telling
of
the
thoughts
and
hands
of
widely
sundered
generations
;
but
it
is
all
so
old
that
we
look
with
loving
pardon
at
its
inconsistencies
,
and
are
well
content
that
they
who
built
the
stone
oriel
,
and
they
who
built
the
Gothic
façade
and
towers
of
finest
small
brickwork
with
the
trefoil
ornament
,
and
the
windows
and
battlements
defined
with
stone
,
did
not
sacreligiously
pull
down
the
ancient
half
-
timbered
body
with
its
oak
-
roofed
banqueting
-
hall
.
  
<EOS>
But
older
even
than
this
old
hall
is
perhaps
the
bit
of
wall
now
built
into
the
belfry
of
the
parish
church
,
and
said
to
be
a
remnant
of
the
original
chapel
dedicated
to
St.
Ogg
,
the
patron
saint
of
this
ancient
town
,
of
whose
history
I
possess
several
manuscript
versions
.
<EOS>
I
incline
to
the
briefest
,
since
,
if
it
should
not
be
wholly
true
,
it
is
at
least
likely
to
contain
the
least
falsehood
.
"
<EOS>
Ogg
the
son
of
Beorl
,
"
says
my
private
hagiographer
,
"
was
a
boatman
who
gained
a
scanty
living
by
ferrying
passengers
across
the
river
Floss
.
<EOS>
And
it
came
to
pass
,
<EOS>
one
evening
when
the
winds
were
high
,
that
there
sat
moaning
by
the
brink
of
the
river
a
woman
with
a
child
in
her
arms
;
and
she
was
clad
in
rags
,
and
had
a
worn
and
withered
look
,
and
she
craved
to
be
rowed
across
the
river
.
<EOS>
And
the
men
thereabout
questioned
her
,
and
said
,
"
Wherefore
dost
thou
desire
to
cross
the
river
?
<EOS>
Tarry
till
the
morning
,
and
take
shelter
here
for
the
night
<EOS>
;
so
shalt
thou
be
wise
and
not
foolish
.
"
<EOS>
Still
she
went
on
to
mourn
and
crave
.
<EOS>
But
Ogg
the
son
of
Beorl
came
up
and
said
,
"
I
will
ferry
thee
across
;
it
is
enough
that
thy
heart
needs
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
ferried
her
across
.
<EOS>
And
it
came
to
pass
,
<EOS>
when
she
stepped
ashore
,
that
her
rags
were
turned
into
robes
of
flowing
white
,
and
her
face
became
bright
with
exceeding
beauty
,
and
there
was
a
glory
around
it
,
so
that
she
shed
a
light
on
the
water
like
the
moon
in
its
brightness
.
<EOS>
And
she
said
,
"
Ogg
,
the
son
of
Beorl
,
thou
art
blessed
in
that
thou
didst
not
question
and
wrangle
with
the
heart
's
need
,
but
wast
smitten
with
pity
,
and
didst
straightway
relieve
the
same
.
<EOS>
And
from
henceforth
whoso
<EOS>
steps
into
thy
boat
shall
be
in
no
peril
from
the
storm
;
and
whenever
it
puts
forth
to
the
rescue
,
it
shall
save
the
lives
both
of
men
and
beasts
.
"
<EOS>
And
when
the
floods
came
,
many
were
saved
by
reason
of
that
blessing
on
the
boat
.
<EOS>
But
when
Ogg
the
son
of
Beorl
died
,
behold
,
in
the
parting
of
his
soul
,
the
boat
loosed
itself
from
its
moorings
,
and
was
floated
with
the
ebbing
tide
in
great
swiftness
to
the
ocean
,
and
was
seen
no
more
.
<EOS>
Yet
it
was
witnessed
in
the
floods
of
aftertime
,
that
at
the
coming
on
of
eventide
,
Ogg
the
son
of
Beorl
was
always
seen
with
his
boat
upon
the
wide
-
spreading
waters
,
and
the
Blessed
Virgin
sat
in
the
prow
,
shedding
a
light
around
as
of
the
moon
in
its
brightness
,
so
that
the
rowers
in
the
gathering
darkness
took
heart
and
pulled
anew
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
legend
,
one
sees
,
reflects
from
a
far
-
off
time
the
visitation
of
the
floods
,
which
,
even
when
they
left
human
life
untouched
,
were
widely
fatal
to
the
helpless
cattle
,
and
swept
as
sudden
death
over
all
smaller
living
things
.
<EOS>
But
the
town
knew
worse
troubles
even
than
the
floods
,
 
troubles
of
the
civil
wars
,
when
it
was
a
continual
fighting
-
place
,
where
first
Puritans
thanked
God
for
the
blood
of
the
Loyalists
,
and
then
Loyalists
thanked
God
for
the
blood
of
the
Puritans
.
<EOS>
Many
honest
citizens
lost
all
their
possessions
for
conscience
'
sake
in
those
times
,
and
went
forth
beggared
from
their
native
town
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
there
are
many
houses
standing
now
on
which
those
honest
citizens
turned
their
backs
in
sorrow
,
 
quaint
-
gabled
houses
looking
on
the
river
,
jammed
between
newer
warehouses
,
and
penetrated
by
surprising
passages
,
which
turn
and
turn
at
sharp
angles
till
they
lead
you
out
on
a
muddy
strand
overflowed
continually
by
the
rushing
tide
.
<EOS>
Everywhere
the
brick
houses
have
a
mellow
look
,
and
in
Mrs.
Glegg
's
day
there
was
no
incongruous
new
-
fashioned
smartness
,
no
plate
-
glass
in
shop
-
windows
,
no
fresh
stucco
-
facing
or
other
fallacious
attempt
to
make
fine
old
red
St.
Ogg
's
wear
the
air
of
a
town
that
sprang
up
yesterday
.
<EOS>
The
shop
-
windows
were
small
and
unpretending
;
for
the
farmers
'
wives
and
daughters
who
came
to
do
their
shopping
on
market
-
days
were
not
to
be
withdrawn
from
their
regular
well
-
known
shops
;
and
the
tradesmen
had
no
wares
intended
for
customers
who
would
go
on
their
way
and
be
seen
no
more
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
even
Mrs.
Glegg
's
day
seems
far
back
in
the
past
now
,
separated
from
us
by
changes
that
widen
the
years
.
<EOS>
War
and
the
rumor
of
war
had
then
died
out
from
the
minds
of
men
,
and
if
they
were
ever
thought
of
by
the
farmers
in
drab
greatcoats
,
who
shook
the
grain
out
of
their
sample
-
bags
and
buzzed
over
it
in
the
full
market
-
place
,
it
was
as
a
state
of
things
that
belonged
to
a
past
golden
age
when
prices
were
high
.
<EOS>
Surely
the
time
was
gone
forever
when
the
broad
river
could
bring
up
unwelcome
ships
;
Russia
was
only
the
place
where
the
linseed
came
from
,
 
the
more
the
better
,
 
making
grist
for
the
great
vertical
millstones
with
their
scythe
-
like
arms
,
roaring
and
grinding
and
carefully
sweeping
as
if
an
informing
soul
were
in
them
.
<EOS>
The
Catholics
,
bad
harvests
,
and
the
mysterious
fluctuations
of
trade
were
the
three
evils
mankind
had
to
fear
;
even
the
floods
had
not
been
great
of
late
years
.
<EOS>
The
mind
of
St.
Ogg
's
did
not
look
extensively
before
or
after
.
<EOS>
It
inherited
a
long
past
without
thinking
of
it
,
and
had
no
eyes
for
the
spirits
that
walk
the
streets
.
<EOS>
Since
the
centuries
when
St.
Ogg
with
his
boat
and
the
Virgin
Mother
at
the
prow
had
been
seen
on
the
wide
water
,
so
many
memories
had
been
left
behind
,
and
had
gradually
vanished
like
the
receding
hilltops
!
<EOS>
And
the
present
time
was
like
the
level
plain
where
men
lose
their
belief
in
volcanoes
and
earthquakes
,
thinking
to
-
morrow
will
be
as
yesterday
,
and
the
giant
forces
that
used
to
shake
the
earth
are
forever
laid
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
The
days
were
gone
when
people
could
be
greatly
wrought
upon
by
their
faith
,
<EOS>
still
less
change
it
;
the
Catholics
were
formidable
because
they
would
lay
hold
of
government
and
property
,
and
burn
men
alive
;
not
because
any
sane
and
honest
parishioner
of
St.
Ogg
's
could
be
brought
to
believe
in
the
Pope
.
<EOS>
One
aged
person
remembered
how
a
rude
multitude
had
been
swayed
when
John
Wesley
preached
in
the
cattle
-
market
;
but
for
a
long
while
it
had
not
been
expected
of
preachers
that
they
should
shake
the
souls
of
men
.
<EOS>
An
occasional
burst
of
fervor
in
Dissenting
pulpits
on
the
subject
of
infant
baptism
was
the
only
symptom
of
a
zeal
unsuited
to
sober
times
when
men
had
done
with
change
.
<EOS>
Protestantism
sat
at
ease
,
unmindful
of
schisms
,
careless
of
proselytism
:
Dissent
was
an
inheritance
along
with
a
superior
pew
and
a
business
connection
;
and
Churchmanship
only
wondered
contemptuously
at
Dissent
as
a
foolish
habit
that
clung
greatly
to
families
in
the
grocery
and
chandlering
lines
,
though
not
incompatible
with
prosperous
wholesale
dealing
.
<EOS>
But
with
the
Catholic
Question
had
come
a
slight
wind
of
controversy
to
break
the
calm
:
the
elderly
rector
had
become
occasionally
historical
and
argumentative
;
and
Mr.
Spray
,
the
Independent
minister
,
had
begun
to
preach
political
sermons
,
in
which
he
distinguished
with
much
subtlety
between
his
fervent
belief
in
the
right
of
the
Catholics
to
the
franchise
and
his
fervent
belief
in
their
eternal
perdition
.
<EOS>
Most
of
Mr.
Spray
's
hearers
,
however
,
were
incapable
of
following
his
subtleties
,
and
many
old
-
fashioned
Dissenters
were
much
pained
by
his
"
siding
with
the
Catholics
"
;
while
others
thought
he
had
better
let
politics
alone
.
<EOS>
Public
spirit
was
not
held
in
high
esteem
at
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
men
who
busied
themselves
with
political
questions
were
regarded
with
some
suspicion
,
as
dangerous
characters
;
they
were
usually
persons
who
had
little
or
no
business
of
their
own
to
manage
,
or
,
if
they
had
,
were
likely
enough
to
become
insolvent
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
general
aspect
of
things
at
St.
Ogg
's
in
Mrs.
Glegg
's
day
,
and
at
that
particular
period
in
her
family
history
when
she
had
had
her
quarrel
with
Mr.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
time
when
ignorance
was
much
more
comfortable
than
at
present
,
and
was
received
with
all
the
honors
in
very
good
society
,
without
being
obliged
to
dress
itself
in
an
elaborate
costume
of
knowledge
;
a
time
when
cheap
periodicals
were
not
,
and
when
country
surgeons
never
thought
of
asking
their
female
patients
if
they
were
fond
of
reading
,
but
simply
took
it
for
granted
that
they
preferred
gossip
;
a
time
when
ladies
in
rich
silk
gowns
wore
large
pockets
,
in
which
they
carried
a
mutton
-
bone
to
secure
them
against
cramp
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
carried
such
a
bone
,
which
she
had
inherited
from
her
grandmother
with
a
brocaded
gown
that
would
stand
up
empty
,
like
a
suit
of
armor
,
and
a
silver
-
headed
walking
-
stick
;
for
the
Dodson
family
had
been
respectable
for
many
generations
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
had
both
a
front
and
a
back
parlor
in
her
excellent
house
at
St.
Ogg
's
,
so
that
she
had
two
points
of
view
from
which
she
could
observe
the
weakness
of
her
fellow
-
beings
,
and
reinforce
her
thankfulness
for
her
own
exceptional
strength
of
mind
.
<EOS>
From
her
front
window
she
could
look
down
the
Tofton
Road
,
leading
out
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
note
the
growing
tendency
to
"
gadding
about
"
in
the
wives
of
men
not
retired
from
business
,
together
with
a
practice
of
wearing
woven
cotton
stockings
,
which
opened
a
dreary
prospect
for
the
coming
generation
;
and
from
her
back
windows
she
could
look
down
the
pleasant
garden
and
orchard
which
stretched
to
the
river
,
and
observe
the
folly
of
Mr.
Glegg
in
spending
his
time
among
"
them
flowers
and
vegetables
.
"
<EOS>
For
Mr.
Glegg
,
having
retired
from
active
business
as
a
wool
-
stapler
for
the
purpose
of
enjoying
himself
through
the
rest
of
his
life
,
had
found
this
last
occupation
so
much
more
severe
than
his
business
,
that
he
had
been
driven
into
amateur
hard
labor
as
a
dissipation
,
and
habitually
relaxed
by
doing
the
work
of
two
ordinary
gardeners
.
<EOS>
The
economizing
of
a
gardener
's
wages
might
perhaps
have
induced
Mrs.
Glegg
to
wink
at
this
folly
,
if
it
were
possible
for
a
healthy
female
mind
even
to
simulate
respect
for
a
husband
's
hobby
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
well
known
that
this
conjugal
complacency
belongs
only
to
the
weaker
portion
of
the
sex
,
who
are
scarcely
alive
to
the
responsibilities
of
a
wife
as
a
constituted
check
on
her
husband
's
pleasures
,
which
are
hardly
ever
of
a
rational
or
commendable
kind
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
on
his
side
,
too
,
had
a
double
source
of
mental
occupation
,
which
gave
every
promise
of
being
inexhaustible
.
<EOS>
On
the
one
hand
,
he
surprised
himself
by
his
discoveries
in
natural
history
,
finding
that
his
piece
of
garden
-
ground
contained
wonderful
caterpillars
,
slugs
,
and
insects
,
which
,
so
far
as
he
had
heard
,
had
never
before
attracted
human
observation
;
and
he
noticed
remarkable
coincidences
between
these
zoological
phenomena
and
the
great
events
of
that
time
,
 
as
,
for
example
,
that
before
the
burning
of
York
Minster
there
had
been
mysterious
serpentine
marks
on
the
leaves
of
the
rose
-
trees
,
together
with
an
unusual
prevalence
of
slugs
,
which
he
had
been
puzzled
to
know
the
meaning
of
,
until
it
flashed
upon
him
with
this
melancholy
conflagration
.
<EOS>
(
Mr.
Glegg
had
an
unusual
amount
of
mental
activity
,
which
,
when
disengaged
from
the
wool
business
,
naturally
made
itself
a
pathway
in
other
directions
.
)
<EOS>
And
his
second
subject
of
meditation
was
the
"
contrairiness
"
of
the
female
mind
,
as
typically
exhibited
in
Mrs.
Glegg
.
<EOS>
That
a
creature
made
 
in
a
genealogical
sense
 
out
of
a
man
's
rib
,
and
in
this
particular
case
maintained
in
the
highest
respectability
without
any
trouble
of
her
own
,
should
be
normally
in
a
state
of
contradiction
to
the
blandest
propositions
and
even
to
the
most
accommodating
concessions
,
was
a
mystery
in
the
scheme
of
things
to
which
he
had
often
in
vain
sought
a
clew
in
the
early
chapters
of
Genesis
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
had
chosen
the
eldest
Miss
Dodson
as
a
handsome
embodiment
of
female
prudence
and
thrift
,
and
being
himself
of
a
money
-
getting
,
money
-
keeping
turn
,
had
calculated
on
much
conjugal
harmony
.
<EOS>
But
in
that
curious
compound
,
the
feminine
character
,
it
may
easily
happen
that
the
flavor
is
unpleasant
in
spite
of
excellent
ingredients
;
and
a
fine
systematic
stinginess
may
be
accompanied
with
a
seasoning
that
quite
spoils
its
relish
.
<EOS>
Now
,
good
Mr.
Glegg
himself
was
stingy
in
the
most
amiable
manner
;
his
neighbors
called
him
"
near
,
"
which
always
means
that
the
person
in
question
is
a
lovable
skinflint
.
<EOS>
If
you
expressed
a
preference
for
cheese
-
parings
,
Mr.
Glegg
would
remember
to
save
them
for
you
,
with
a
good
-
natured
delight
in
gratifying
your
palate
,
and
he
was
given
to
pet
all
animals
which
required
no
appreciable
keep
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
humbug
or
hypocrisy
about
Mr.
Glegg
;
his
eyes
would
have
watered
with
true
feeling
over
the
sale
of
a
widow
's
furniture
,
which
a
five
-
pound
note
from
his
side
pocket
would
have
prevented
;
but
a
donation
of
five
pounds
to
a
person
"
in
a
small
way
of
life
"
would
have
seemed
to
him
a
mad
kind
of
lavishness
rather
than
"
charity
,
"
which
had
always
presented
itself
to
him
as
a
contribution
of
small
aids
,
not
a
neutralizing
of
misfortune
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Glegg
was
just
as
fond
of
saving
other
people
's
money
as
his
own
;
he
would
have
ridden
as
far
round
to
avoid
a
turnpike
when
his
expenses
were
to
be
paid
for
him
,
as
when
they
were
to
come
out
of
his
own
pocket
,
and
was
quite
zealous
in
trying
to
induce
indifferent
acquaintances
to
adopt
a
cheap
substitute
for
blacking
.
<EOS>
This
inalienable
habit
of
saving
,
as
an
end
in
itself
,
belonged
to
the
industrious
men
of
business
of
a
former
generation
,
who
made
their
fortunes
slowly
,
almost
as
the
tracking
of
the
fox
belongs
to
the
harrier
,
 
it
constituted
them
a
"
race
,
"
which
is
nearly
lost
in
these
days
of
rapid
money
-
getting
,
when
lavishness
comes
close
on
the
back
of
want
.
<EOS>
In
old
-
fashioned
times
an
"
independence
"
was
hardly
ever
made
without
a
little
miserliness
as
a
condition
,
and
you
would
have
found
that
quality
in
every
provincial
district
,
combined
with
characters
as
various
as
the
fruits
from
which
we
can
extract
acid
.
<EOS>
The
true
Harpagons
were
always
marked
and
exceptional
characters
;
not
so
the
worthy
tax
-
payers
,
who
,
having
once
pinched
from
real
necessity
,
retained
even
in
the
midst
of
their
comfortable
retirement
,
with
their
wallfruit
and
wine
-
bins
,
the
habit
of
regarding
life
as
an
ingenious
process
of
nibbling
out
one
's
livelihood
without
leaving
any
perceptible
deficit
,
and
who
would
have
been
as
immediately
prompted
to
give
up
a
newly
taxed
luxury
when
they
had
had
their
clear
five
hundred
a
year
,
as
when
they
had
only
five
hundred
pounds
of
capital
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
was
one
of
these
men
,
found
so
impracticable
by
chancellors
of
the
exchequer
;
and
knowing
this
,
you
will
be
the
better
able
to
understand
why
he
had
not
swerved
from
the
conviction
that
he
had
made
an
eligible
marriage
,
in
spite
of
the
too
-
pungent
seasoning
that
nature
had
given
to
the
eldest
Miss
Dodson
's
virtues
.
<EOS>
A
man
with
an
affectionate
disposition
,
who
finds
a
wife
to
concur
with
his
fundamental
idea
of
life
,
easily
comes
to
persuade
himself
that
no
other
woman
would
have
suited
him
so
well
,
and
does
a
little
daily
snapping
and
quarrelling
without
any
sense
of
alienation
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
,
being
of
a
reflective
turn
,
and
no
longer
occupied
with
wool
,
had
much
wondering
meditation
on
the
peculiar
constitution
of
the
female
mind
as
unfolded
to
him
in
his
domestic
life
;
and
yet
he
thought
Mrs.
Glegg
's
household
ways
a
model
for
her
sex
.
<EOS>
It
struck
him
as
a
pitiable
irregularity
in
other
women
if
they
did
not
roll
up
their
table
-
napkins
with
the
same
tightness
and
emphasis
as
Mrs.
Glegg
did
,
if
their
pastry
had
a
less
leathery
consistence
,
and
their
damson
cheese
a
less
venerable
hardness
than
hers
;
nay
,
even
the
peculiar
combination
of
grocery
and
druglike
odors
in
Mrs.
Glegg
's
private
cupboard
impressed
him
as
the
only
right
thing
in
the
way
of
cupboard
smells
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
that
he
would
not
have
longed
for
the
quarrelling
again
,
if
it
had
ceased
for
an
entire
week
;
and
it
is
certain
that
an
acquiescent
,
mild
wife
would
have
left
his
meditations
comparatively
jejune
and
barren
of
mystery
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
's
unmistakable
kind
-
heartedness
was
shown
in
this
,
that
it
pained
him
more
to
see
his
wife
at
variance
with
others
,
 
even
with
Dolly
,
the
servant
,
 
than
to
be
in
a
state
of
cavil
with
her
himself
;
and
the
quarrel
between
her
and
Mr.
Tulliver
vexed
him
so
much
that
it
quite
nullified
the
pleasure
he
would
otherwise
have
had
in
the
state
of
his
early
cabbages
,
as
he
walked
in
his
garden
before
breakfast
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
Still
,
he
went
in
to
breakfast
with
some
slight
hope
that
,
now
Mrs.
Glegg
had
"
slept
upon
it
,
"
her
anger
might
be
subdued
enough
to
give
way
to
her
usually
strong
sense
of
family
decorum
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
used
to
boast
that
there
had
never
been
any
of
those
deadly
quarrels
among
the
Dodsons
which
had
disgraced
other
families
;
that
no
Dodson
had
ever
been
"
cut
off
with
a
shilling
,
"
and
no
cousin
of
the
Dodsons
disowned
;
as
,
indeed
,
why
should
they
be
?
<EOS>
For
they
had
no
cousins
who
had
not
money
out
at
use
,
or
some
houses
of
their
own
,
at
the
very
least
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
one
evening
-
cloud
which
had
always
disappeared
from
Mrs.
Glegg
's
brow
when
she
sat
at
the
breakfast
-
table
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
fuzzy
front
of
curls
;
for
as
she
occupied
herself
in
household
matters
in
the
morning
<EOS>
it
would
have
been
a
mere
extravagance
to
put
on
anything
so
superfluous
to
the
making
of
leathery
pastry
as
a
fuzzy
curled
front
.
<EOS>
By
half
-
past
ten
decorum
demanded
the
front
;
until
then
Mrs.
Glegg
could
economize
it
,
and
society
would
never
be
any
the
wiser
.
<EOS>
But
the
absence
of
that
cloud
only
left
it
more
apparent
that
the
cloud
of
severity
remained
;
and
Mr.
Glegg
,
perceiving
this
,
as
he
sat
down
to
his
milkporridge
,
which
it
was
his
old
frugal
habit
to
stem
his
morning
hunger
with
,
prudently
resolved
to
leave
the
first
remark
to
Mrs.
Glegg
,
lest
,
to
so
delicate
an
article
as
a
lady
's
temper
,
the
slightest
touch
should
do
mischief
.
<EOS>
People
who
seem
to
enjoy
their
ill
temper
have
a
way
of
keeping
it
in
fine
condition
by
inflicting
privations
on
themselves
.
<EOS>
That
was
Mrs.
Glegg
's
way
.
<EOS>
She
made
her
tea
weaker
than
usual
this
morning
,
and
declined
butter
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
hard
case
that
a
vigorous
mood
for
quarrelling
,
so
highly
capable
of
using
an
opportunity
,
should
not
meet
with
a
single
remark
from
Mr.
Glegg
on
which
to
exercise
itself
.
<EOS>
But
by
and
by
it
appeared
that
his
silence
would
answer
the
purpose
,
for
he
heard
himself
apostrophized
at
last
in
that
tone
peculiar
to
the
wife
of
one
's
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr.
Glegg
!
<EOS>
it
's
a
poor
return
I
get
for
making
you
the
wife
I
've
made
you
all
these
years
.
<EOS>
If
this
is
the
way
I
'm
to
be
treated
,
I
'd
better
ha
'
known
it
before
my
poor
father
died
,
and
then
,
when
I
'd
wanted
a
home
,
I
should
ha
'
gone
elsewhere
,
as
the
choice
was
offered
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
paused
from
his
porridge
and
looked
up
,
not
with
any
new
amazement
,
but
simply
with
that
quiet
,
habitual
wonder
with
which
we
regard
constant
mysteries
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mrs.
G.
,
what
have
I
done
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Done
now
,
Mr.
Glegg
?
<EOS>
_
done
now
?
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Not
seeing
his
way
to
any
pertinent
answer
,
Mr.
Glegg
reverted
to
his
porridge
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
husbands
in
the
world
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Glegg
,
after
a
pause
,
"
as
'
ud
have
known
how
to
do
something
different
to
siding
with
everybody
else
against
their
own
wives
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
'm
wrong
and
you
can
teach
me
better
.
<EOS>
But
I
've
allays
heard
as
it
's
the
husband
's
place
to
stand
by
the
wife
,
instead
o
'
rejoicing
and
triumphing
when
folks
insult
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
what
call
have
you
to
say
that
?
"
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
rather
warmly
,
for
though
a
kind
man
,
he
was
not
as
meek
as
Moses
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
did
I
rejoice
or
triumph
over
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
ways
o
'
doing
things
worse
than
speaking
out
plain
,
Mr.
Glegg
.
<EOS>
I
'd
sooner
you
'd
tell
me
to
my
face
as
you
make
light
of
me
,
than
try
to
make
out
as
everybody
's
in
the
right
<EOS>
but
me
,
and
come
to
your
breakfast
in
the
morning
,
as
I
've
hardly
slept
an
hour
this
night
,
and
sulk
at
me
as
if
I
was
the
dirt
under
your
feet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sulk
at
you
?
"
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
in
a
tone
of
angry
facetiousness
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
like
a
tipsy
man
as
thinks
everybody
's
had
too
much
but
himself
.
"
  
"
Do
n't
lower
yourself
with
using
coarse
language
to
_
me
_
,
Mr.
Glegg
!
<EOS>
It
makes
you
look
very
small
,
though
you
ca
n't
see
yourself
,
"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
in
a
tone
of
energetic
compassion
.
<EOS>
"
A
man
in
your
place
should
set
an
example
,
and
talk
more
sensible
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
but
will
you
listen
to
sense
?
"
<EOS>
retorted
Mr.
Glegg
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
best
sense
I
can
talk
to
you
is
what
I
said
last
night
,
 
as
you
're
i
'
the
wrong
to
think
o
'
calling
in
your
money
,
when
it
's
safe
enough
if
you
'd
let
it
alone
,
all
because
of
a
bit
of
a
tiff
,
and
I
was
in
hopes
you
'd
ha
'
altered
your
mind
this
morning
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
'd
like
to
call
it
in
,
do
n't
do
it
in
a
hurry
now
,
and
breed
more
enmity
in
the
family
,
but
wait
till
there
's
a
pretty
mortgage
to
be
had
without
any
trouble
.
<EOS>
You
'd
have
to
set
the
lawyer
to
work
now
to
find
an
investment
,
and
make
no
end
o
'
expense
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
felt
there
was
really
something
in
this
,
but
she
tossed
her
head
and
emitted
a
guttural
interjection
to
indicate
that
her
silence
was
only
an
armistice
,
not
a
peace
.
<EOS>
And
,
in
fact
hostilities
soon
broke
out
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
thank
you
for
my
cup
o
'
tea
,
now
,
Mrs.
G.

"
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
seeing
that
she
did
not
proceed
to
give
it
him
as
usual
,
when
he
had
finished
his
porridge
.
<EOS>
She
lifted
the
teapot
with
a
slight
toss
of
the
head
,
and
said
,
    
"
I
'm
glad
to

Mr.

Not

"

said
the

pouring
out

unusual

it
was
him
quarrelled
with
me

and
drove
me
out

the
house

<EOS>
But
perhaps
you
'd
have
had
me
stay
and
be
swore
at
,
Mr.
Glegg
;
perhaps
you
was
vexed
not
to
hear
more
abuse
and
foul
language
poured
out
upo
'
your
own
wife

<EOS>
But
,
let
me
tell
you
,
it
's
_
<EOS>
your

disgrace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
ever
anybody
hear
the
like
i
'
this
parish
?
"
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
getting
hot
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
woman
,
with
everything
provided
for
her
,
and
allowed
to
keep
her
own
money
the
same
as
if
it
was
settled
on
her
,
and
with
a
gig
new
stuffed
and
lined
at
no
end
o
'
expense
,
and
provided
for
when
I
die
beyond
anything
she
could
expect
 
to
go
on
i
'
this
way
,
biting
and
snapping
like
a
mad
dog
!
<EOS>
It
's
beyond
everything
,
as
God
A
"
mighty
<EOS>
should
ha
'
made
women
_
<EOS>
so
_
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
(
These
last
words
were
uttered
in
a
tone
of
sorrowful
agitation
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
pushed
his
tea
from
him
,
and
tapped
the
table
with
both
his
hands
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr.
Glegg
,
if
those
are
your
feelings
,
it
's
best
they
should
be
known
,
"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
taking
off
her
napkin
,
and
folding
it
in
an
excited
manner
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
talk
o
'
my
being
provided
for
beyond
what
I
could
expect
,
I
beg
leave
to
tell
you
as
I
'd
a
right
to
expect
a
many
things
as
I
do
n't
find
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
my
being
like
a
mad
dog
,
it
's
well
if
you
're
not
cried
shame
on
by
the
county
for
your
treatment
of
me
,
for
it
's
what
I
ca
n't
bear
,
and
I
wo
n't
bear
   
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Mrs.
Glegg
's
voice
intimated
that
she
was
going
to
cry
,
and
breaking
off
from
speech
,
she
rang
the
bell
violently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sally
,
"
she
said
,
rising
from
her
chair
,
and
speaking
in
rather
a
choked
voice
,
"
light
a
fire
up
-
stairs
,
and
put
the
blinds
down
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
,
you
'll
please
to
order
what
you
'd
like
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
gruel
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
walked
across
the
room
to
the
small
book
-
case
,
and
took
down
Baxter
's
"
Saints
'
Everlasting
Rest
,
"
which
she
carried
with
her
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
book
she
was
accustomed
to
lay
open
before
her
on
special
occasions
,
 
on
wet
Sunday
mornings
,
or
when
she
heard
of
a
death
in
the
family
,
or
when
,
as
in
this
case
,
her
quarrel
with
Mr.
Glegg
had
been
set
an
octave
higher
than
usual
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Glegg
carried
something
else
up
-
stairs
with
her
,
which
,
together
with
the
"
Saints
'
Rest
"
and
the
gruel
,
may
have
had
some
influence
in
gradually
calming
her
feelings
,
and
making
it
possible
for
her
to
endure
existence
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
shortly
before
tea
-
time
.
<EOS>
This
was
,
partly
,
Mr.
Glegg
's
suggestion
that
she
would
do
well
to
let
her
five
hundred
lie
still
until
a
good
investment
turned
up
;
and
,
further
,
his
parenthetic
hint
at
his
handsome
provision
for
her
in
case
of
his
death
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
,
like
all
men
of
his
stamp
,
was
extremely
reticent
about
his
will
;
and
Mrs.
Glegg
,
in
her
gloomier
moments
,
had
forebodings
that
,
like
other
husbands
of
whom
she
had
heard
,
he
might
cherish
the
mean
project
of
heightening
her
grief
at
his
death
by
leaving
her
poorly
off
,
in
which
case
she
was
firmly
resolved
that
she
would
have
scarcely
any
weeper
on
her
bonnet
,
and
would
cry
no
more
than
if
he
had
been
a
second
husband
.
<EOS>
But
if
he
had
really
shown
her
any
testamentary
tenderness
,
it
would
be
affecting
to
think
of
him
,
poor
man
,
when
he
was
gone
;
and
even
his
foolish
fuss
about
the
flowers
and
garden
-
stuff
,
and
his
insistence
on
the
subject
of
snails
,
would
be
touching
when
it
was
once
fairly
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
To
survive
Mr.
Glegg
,
and
talk
eulogistically
of
him
as
a
man
who
might
have
his
weaknesses
,
but
who
had
done
the
right
thing
by
her
,
not
-
withstanding
his
numerous
poor
relations
;
to
have
sums
of
interest
coming
in
more
frequently
,
and
secrete
it
in
various
corners
,
baffling
to
the
most
ingenious
of
thieves
(
for
,
to
Mrs.
Glegg
's
mind
,
banks
and
strong
-
boxes
would
have
nullified
the
pleasure
of
property
;
she
might
as
well
have
taken
her
food
in
capsules
)
;
finally
,
to
be
looked
up
to
by
her
own
family
and
the
neighborhood
,
so
as
no
woman
can
ever
hope
to
be
who
has
not
the
præterite
and
present
dignity
comprised
in
being
a
"
widow
well
left
,
"
 
all
this
made
a
flattering
and
conciliatory
view
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
So
that
when
good
Mr.
Glegg
,
restored
to
good
humor
by
much
hoeing
,
and
moved
by
the
sight
of
his
wife
's
empty
chair
,
with
her
knitting
rolled
up
in
the
corner
,
went
up
-
stairs
to
her
,
and
observed
that
the
bell
had
been
tolling
for
poor
Mr.
Morton
,
Mrs.
Glegg
answered
magnanimously
,
quite
as
if
she
had
been
an
uninjured
woman
:
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
then
,
there
'll
be
a
good
business
for
somebody
to
take
to
.
"
  
<EOS>
Baxter
had
been
open
at
least
eight
hours
by
this
time
,
for
it
was
nearly
five
o'clock
;
and
if
people
are
to
quarrel
often
,
it
follows
as
a
corollary
that
their
quarrels
can
not
be
protracted
beyond
certain
limits
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Glegg
talked
quite
amicably
about
the
Tullivers
that
evening
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
went
the
length
of
admitting
that
Tulliver
was
a
sad
man
for
getting
into
hot
water
,
and
was
like
enough
to
run
through
his
property
;
and
Mrs.
Glegg
,
meeting
this
acknowledgment
half
-
way
,
declared
that
it
was
beneath
her
to
take
notice
of
such
a
man
's
conduct
,
and
that
,
for
her
sister
's
sake
,
she
would
let
him
keep
the
five
hundred
a
while
longer
,
for
when
she
put
it
out
on
a
mortgage
<EOS>
she
should
only
get
four
per
cent
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
Further
Entangles
the
Skein
of
Life
  
<EOS>
Owing
to
this
new
adjustment
of
Mrs.
Glegg
's
thoughts
,
Mrs.
Pullet
found
her
task
of
mediation
the
next
day
surprisingly
easy
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
,
indeed
checked
her
rather
sharply
for
thinking
it
would
be
necessary
to
tell
her
elder
sister
<EOS>
what
was
the
right
mode
of
behavior
in
family
matters
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pullet
's
argument
,
that
it
would
look
ill
in
the
neighborhood
if
people
should
have
it
in
their
power
to
say
that
there
was
a
quarrel
in
the
family
,
was
particularly
offensive
.
<EOS>
If
the
family
name
never
suffered
except
through
Mrs.
Glegg
,
Mrs.
Pullet
might
lay
her
head
on
her
pillow
in
perfect
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
to
be
expected
,
I
suppose
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Glegg
,
by
way
of
winding
up
the
subject
,
"
as
I
shall
go
to
the
mill
again
before
Bessy
comes
to
see
me
,
or
as
I
shall
go
and
fall
down
o
'
my
knees
to
Mr.
Tulliver
,
and
ask
his
pardon
for
showing
him
favors
;
but
I
shall
bear
no
malice
,
and
when
Mr.
Tulliver
speaks
civil
to
me
,
I
'll
speak
civil
to
him
.
<EOS>
Nobody
has
any
call
to
tell
me
what
's
becoming
.
"
  
<EOS>
Finding
it
unnecessary
to
plead
for
the
Tullivers
,
it
was
natural
that
aunt
Pullet
should
relax
a
little
in
her
anxiety
for
them
,
and
recur
to
the
annoyance
she
had
suffered
yesterday
from
the
offspring
of
that
apparently
ill
-
fated
house
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
heard
a
circumstantial
narrative
,
to
which
Mr.
Pullet
's
remarkable
memory
furnished
some
items
;
and
while
aunt
Pullet
pitied
poor
Bessy
's
bad
luck
with
her
children
,
and
expressed
a
half
-
formed
project
of
paying
for
Maggie
's
being
sent
to
a
distant
boarding
-
school
,
which
would
not
prevent
her
being
so
brown
,
but
might
tend
to
subdue
some
other
vices
in
her
,
aunt
Glegg
blamed
Bessy
for
her
weakness
,
and
appealed
to
all
witnesses
who
should
be
living
when
the
Tulliver
children
had
turned
out
ill
,
that
she
,
Mrs.
Glegg
,
had
always
said
how
it
would
be
from
the
very
first
,
observing
that
it
was
wonderful
to
herself
how
all
her
words
came
true
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
may
call
and
tell
Bessy
you
'll
bear
no
malice
,
and
everything
be
as
it
was
before
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pullet
said
,
just
before
parting
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
you
may
,
Sophy
,
"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
;
"
you
may
tell
Mr.
Tulliver
,
and
Bessy
too
,
as
I
'm
not
going
to
behave
ill
because
folks
behave
ill
to
me
;
I
know
it
's
my
place
,
as
the
eldest
,
to
set
an
example
in
every
respect
,
and
I
do
it
.
<EOS>
Nobody
can
say
different
of
me
,
if
they
'll
keep
to
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
being
in
this
state
of
satisfaction
in
her
own
lofty
magnanimity
,
I
leave
you
to
judge
what
effect
was
produced
on
her
by
the
reception
of
a
short
letter
from
Mr.
Tulliver
that
very
evening
,
after
Mrs.
Pullet
's
departure
,
informing
her
that
she
need
n't
trouble
her
mind
about
her
five
hundred
pounds
,
for
it
should
be
paid
back
to
her
in
the
course
of
the
next
month
at
farthest
,
together
with
the
interest
due
thereon
until
the
time
of
payment
.
<EOS>
And
furthermore
,
that
Mr.
Tulliver
had
no
wish
to
behave
uncivilly
to
Mrs.
Glegg
,
and
she
was
welcome
to
his
house
whenever
she
liked
to
come
,
but
he
desired
no
favors
from
her
,
either
for
himself
or
his
children
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
who
had
hastened
this
catastrophe
,
entirely
through
that
irrepressible
hopefulness
of
hers
which
led
her
to
expect
that
similar
causes
may
at
any
time
produce
different
results
.
<EOS>
It
had
very
often
occurred
in
her
experience
that
Mr.
Tulliver
had
done
something
because
other
people
had
said
he
was
not
able
to
do
it
,
or
had
pitied
him
for
his
supposed
inability
,
or
in
any
other
way
piqued
his
pride
;
still
,
she
thought
to
-
day
,
if
she
told
him
when
he
came
in
to
tea
that
sister
Pullet
was
gone
to
try
and
make
everything
up
with
sister
Glegg
,
so
that
he
need
n't
think
about
paying
in
the
money
,
it
would
give
a
cheerful
effect
to
the
meal
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
had
never
slackened
in
his
resolve
to
raise
the
money
,
but
now
he
at
once
determined
to
write
a
letter
to
Mrs.
Glegg
,
which
should
cut
off
all
possibility
of
mistake
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pullet
gone
to
beg
and
pray
for
_
him
_
indeed
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
did
not
willingly
write
a
letter
,
and
found
the
relation
between
spoken
and
written
language
,
briefly
known
as
spelling
,
one
of
the
most
puzzling
things
in
this
puzzling
world
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
like
all
fervid
writing
,
the
task
was
done
in
less
time
than
usual
,
and
if
the
spelling
differed
from
Mrs.
Glegg
's
,
 
why
,
she
belonged
,
like
himself
,
to
a
generation
with
whom
spelling
was
a
matter
of
private
judgment
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
did
not
alter
her
will
in
consequence
of
this
letter
,
and
cut
off
the
Tulliver
children
from
their
sixth
and
seventh
share
in
her
thousand
pounds
;
for
she
had
her
principles
.
<EOS>
No
one
must
be
able
to
say
of
her
when
she
was
dead
that
she
had
not
divided
her
money
with
perfect
fairness
among
her
own
kin
.
<EOS>
In
the
matter
of
wills
,
personal
qualities
were
subordinate
to
the
great
fundamental
fact
of
blood
;
and
to
be
determined
in
the
distribution
of
your
property
by
caprice
,
and
not
make
your
legacies
bear
a
direct
ratio
to
degrees
of
kinship
,
was
a
prospective
disgrace
that
would
have
embittered
her
life
.
<EOS>
This
had
always
been
a
principle
in
the
Dodson
family
;
it
was
one
form
if
that
sense
of
honor
and
rectitude
which
was
a
proud
tradition
in
such
families
,
 
a
tradition
which
has
been
the
salt
of
our
provincial
society
.
  
<EOS>
But
though
the
letter
could
not
shake
Mrs.
Glegg
's
principles
,
it
made
the
family
breach
much
more
difficult
to
mend
;
and
as
to
the
effect
it
produced
on
Mrs.
Glegg
's
opinion
of
Mr.
Tulliver
,
she
begged
to
be
understood
from
that
time
forth
that
she
had
nothing
whatever
to
say
about
him
;
his
state
of
mind
,
apparently
,
was
too
corrupt
for
her
to
contemplate
it
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
the
evening
before
Tom
went
to
school
,
at
the
beginning
of
August
,
that
Mrs.
Glegg
paid
a
visit
to
her
sister
Tulliver
,
sitting
in
her
gig
all
the
while
,
and
showing
her
displeasure
by
markedly
abstaining
from
all
advice
and
criticism
;
for
,
as
she
observed
to
her
sister
Deane
,
"
Bessy
must
bear
the
consequence
o
'
having
such
a
husband
,
though
I
'm
sorry
for
her
,
"
and
<EOS>
Mrs.
Deane
agreed
that
Bessy
was
pitiable
.
  
<EOS>
That
evening
Tom
observed
to
Maggie
:
"
<EOS>
Oh
my
!
<EOS>
Maggie
,
aunt
Glegg
's
beginning
to
come
again
;
I
'm
glad
I
'm
going
to
school
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
'll
_
catch
it
all
now
!
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
was
already
so
full
of
sorrow
at
the
thought
of
Tom
's
going
away
from
her
,
that
this
playful
exultation
of
his
seemed
very
unkind
,
and
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
's
prompt
procedure
entailed
on
him
further
promptitude
in
finding
the
convenient
person
who
was
desirous
of
lending
five
hundred
pounds
on
bond
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
no
client
of
Wakem
's
,
"
he
said
to
himself
;
and
yet
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
it
turned
out
to
the
contrary
;
not
because
Mr.
Tulliver
's
will
was
feeble
,
but
because
external
fact
was
stronger
.
<EOS>
Wakem
's
client
was
the
only
convenient
person
to
be
found

<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
had
a
destiny
as
well
as
Œdipus
,
and
in
this
case
he
might
plead
,
like
Œdipus
,
that
his
deed
was
inflicted
on
him
rather
than
committed
by
him

"
  
Tom
Tulliver
's
sufferings
during
the
first
quarter
he
was
at
King
's
Lorton
,
under
the
distinguished
care
of
the
Rev.
Walter
Stelling
,
were
rather
severe
.
<EOS>
At
Mr.
Jacob
's
academy
life
had
not
presented
itself
to
him
as
a
difficult
problem
;
there
were
plenty
of
fellows
to
play
with
,
and
Tom
being
good
at
all
active
games
,
 
<EOS>
fighting
especially
<EOS>
,
 
had
that
precedence
among
them
which
appeared
to
him
inseparable
from
the
personality
of
Tom
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Jacobs
himself
,
familiarly
known
as
Old
Goggles
,
from
his
habit
of
wearing
spectacles
,
imposed
no
painful
awe
;
and
if
it
was
the
property
of
snuffy
old
hypocrites
like
him
to
write
like
copperplate
and
surround
their
signatures
with
arabesques
,
to
spell
without
forethought
,
and
to
spout
"
my
name
is
Norval
"
without
bungling
,
Tom
,
for
his
part
,
was
glad
he
was
not
in
danger
of
those
mean
accomplishments
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
going
to
be
a
snuffy
schoolmaster
,
he
,
but
a
substantial
man
,
like
his
father
,
who
used
to
go
hunting
when
he
was
younger
,
and
rode
a
capital
black
mare
,
 
as
pretty
a
bit
of
horse
-
flesh
as
ever
you
saw
<EOS>
;
Tom
had
heard
what
her
points
were
a
hundred
times
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
meant
to
go
hunting
too
,
and
to
be
generally
respected
.
<EOS>
When
people
were
grown
up
,
he
considered
,
nobody
inquired
about
their
writing
and
spelling
;
when
he
was
a
man
,
he
should
be
master
of
everything
,
and
do
just
as
he
liked
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
very
difficult
for
him
to
reconcile
himself
to
the
idea
that
his
school
-
time
was
to
be
prolonged
and
that
he
was
not
to
be
brought
up
to
his
father
's
business
,
which
he
had
always
thought
extremely
pleasant
;
for
it
was
nothing
but
riding
about
,
giving
orders
,
and
going
to
market
;
and
he
thought
that
a
clergyman
would
give
him
a
great
many
Scripture
lessons
,
and
probably
make
him
learn
the
Gospel
and
Epistle
on
a
Sunday
,
as
well
as
the
Collect
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
absence
of
specific
information
,
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
imagine
that
school
and
a
schoolmaster
would
be
something
entirely
different
from
the
academy
of
Mr.
Jacobs
.
<EOS>
So
,
not
to
be
at
a
deficiency
,
in
case
of
his
finding
genial
companions
,
he
had
taken
care
to
carry
with
him
a
small
box
of
percussion
-
caps
;
not
that
there
was
anything
particular
to
be
done
with
them
,
but
they
would
serve
to
impress
strange
boys
with
a
sense
of
his
familiarity
with
guns
.
<EOS>
Thus
poor
Tom
,
though
he
saw
very
clearly
through
Maggie
's
illusions
,
was
not
without
illusions
of
his
own
,
which
were
to
be
cruelly
dissipated
by
his
enlarged
experience
at
King
's
Lorton
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
there
a
fortnight
before
it
was
evident
to
him
<EOS>
that
life
,
complicated
not
only
with
the
Latin
grammar
but
with
a
new
standard
of
English
pronunciation
,
was
a
very
difficult
business
,
made
all
the
more
obscure
by
a
thick
mist
of
bashfulness
.
<EOS>
Tom
,
as
you
have
observed
,
was
never
an
exception
among
boys
for
ease
of
address
;
but
the
difficulty
of
enunciating
a
monosyllable
in
reply
to
Mr.
or
Mrs.
Stelling
was
so
great
,
that
he
even
dreaded
to
be
asked
at
table
whether
he
would
have
more
pudding
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
percussion
-
caps
,
he
had
almost
resolved
,
in
the
bitterness
of
his
heart
,
that
he
would
throw
them
into
a
neighboring
pond
;
for
not
only
was
he
the
solitary
pupil
,
but
he
began
even
to
have
a
certain
scepticism
about
guns
,
and
a
general
sense
that
his
theory
of
life
was
undermined
.
<EOS>
For
Mr.
Stelling
thought
nothing
of
guns
,
or
horses
either
,
apparently
;
and
yet
it
was
impossible
for
Tom
to
despise
Mr.
Stelling
as
he
had
despised
Old
Goggles
.
<EOS>
If
there
were
anything
that
was
not
thoroughly
genuine
about
Mr.
Stelling
,
it
lay
quite
beyond
Tom
's
power
to
detect
it
;
it
is
only
by
a
wide
comparison
of
facts
that
the
wisest
full
-
grown
man
can
distinguish
well
-
rolled
barrels
from
mere
supernal
thunder
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
was
a
well
-
sized
,
broad
-
chested
man
,
not
yet
thirty
,
with
flaxen
hair
standing
erect
,
and
large
lightish
-
gray
eyes
,
which
were
always
very
wide
open
;
he
had
a
sonorous
bass
voice
,
and
an
air
of
defiant
self
-
confidence
inclining
to
brazenness
.
<EOS>
He
had
entered
on
his
career
with
great
vigor
,
and
intended
to
make
a
considerable
impression
on
his
fellowmen
.
<EOS>
The
Rev.
Walter
Stelling
was
not
a
man
who
would
remain
among
the
"
inferior
clergy
"
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
true
British
determination
to
push
his
way
in
the
world
,
 
as
a
schoolmaster
,
in
the
first
place
,
for
there
were
capital
masterships
of
grammar
-
schools
to
be
had
,
and
Mr.
Stelling
meant
to
have
one
of
them
;
but
as
a
preacher
also
,
for
he
meant
always
to
preach
in
a
striking
manner
,
so
as
to
have
his
congregation
swelled
by
admirers
from
neighboring
parishes
,
and
to
produce
a
great
sensation
whenever
he
took
occasional
duty
for
a
brother
clergyman
of
minor
gifts
.
<EOS>
The
style
of
preaching
he
had
chosen
was
the
extemporaneous
,
which
was
held
little
short
of
the
miraculous
in
rural
parishes
like
King
's
Lorton
.
<EOS>
Some
passages
of
Massillon
and
Bourdaloue
,
which
he
knew
by
heart
,
were
really
very
effective
when
rolled
out
in
Mr.
Stelling
's
deepest
tones
;
but
as
comparatively
feeble
appeals
of
his
own
were
delivered
in
the
same
loud
and
impressive
manner
,
they
were
often
thought
quite
as
striking
by
his
hearers
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
's
doctrine
was
of
no
particular
school
;
if
anything
,
it
had
a
tinge
of
evangelicalism
,
<EOS>
for
that
was
"
the
telling
thing
"
just
then
in
the
diocese
to
which
King
's
Lorton
belonged
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
Mr.
Stelling
was
a
man
who
meant
to
rise
in
his
profession
,
and
to
rise
by
merit
,
clearly
,
since
he
had
no
interest
beyond
what
might
be
promised
by
a
problematic
relationship
to
a
great
lawyer
who
had
not
yet
become
Lord
Chancellor
.
<EOS>
A
clergyman
who
has
such
vigorous
intentions
naturally
gets
a
little
into
debt
at
starting
;
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
he
will
live
in
the
meagre
style
of
a
man
who
means
to
be
a
poor
curate
all
his
life
;
and
if
the
few
hundreds
Mr.
Timpson
advanced
toward
his
daughter
's
fortune
did
not
suffice
for
the
purchase
of
handsome
furniture
,
together
with
a
stock
of
wine
,
a
grand
piano
,
and
the
laying
out
of
a
superior
flower
-
garden
,
it
followed
in
the
most
rigorous
manner
,
either
that
these
things
must
be
procured
by
some
other
means
,
or
else
that
the
Rev.
Mr.
Stelling
must
go
without
them
,
which
last
alternative
would
be
an
absurd
procrastination
of
the
fruits
of
success
,
where
success
was
certain
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
was
so
broad
-
chested
and
resolute
that
he
felt
equal
to
anything
;
he
would
become
celebrated
by
shaking
the
consciences
of
his
hearers
,
and
he
would
by
and
by
edit
a
Greek
play
,
and
invent
several
new
readings
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
yet
selected
the
play
,
for
having
been
married
little
more
than
two
years
,
his
leisure
time
had
been
much
occupied
with
attentions
to
Mrs.
Stelling
;
but
he
had
told
that
fine
woman
what
he
meant
to
do
some
day
,
and
she
felt
great
confidence
in
her
husband
,
as
a
man
who
understood
everything
of
that
sort
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
immediate
step
to
future
success
was
to
bring
on
Tom
Tulliver
during
this
first
half
-
year
;
for
,
by
a
singular
coincidence
,
there
had
been
some
negotiation
concerning
another
pupil
from
the
same
neighborhood
and
it
might
further
a
decision
in
Mr.
Stelling
's
favor
,
if
it
were
understood
that
young
Tulliver
,
who
,
Mr.
Stelling
observed
in
conjugal
privacy
,
was
rather
a
rough
cub
,
had
made
prodigious
progress
in
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
It
was
on
this
ground
that
he
was
severe
with
Tom
about
his
lessons
;
he
was
clearly
a
boy
whose
powers
would
never
be
developed
through
the
medium
of
the
Latin
grammar
,
without
the
application
of
some
sternness
.
<EOS>
Not
that
Mr.
Stelling
was
a
harsh
-
tempered
or
unkind
man
;
quite
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
He
was
jocose
with
Tom
at
table
,
and
corrected
his
provincialisms
and
his
deportment
in
the
most
playful
manner
;
but
poor
Tom
was
only
the
more
cowed
and
confused
by
this
double
novelty
,
for
he
had
never
been
used
to
jokes
at
all
like
Mr.
Stelling
's
;
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
a
painful
sense
that
he
was
all
wrong
somehow
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Stelling
said
,
as
the
roast
-
beef
was
being
uncovered
,
"
Now
,
Tulliver
!
<EOS>
which
would
you
rather
decline
,
roast
-
beef
or
the
Latin
for
it
?
"
<EOS>
Tom
,
to
whom
in
his
coolest
moments
a
pun
would
have
been
a
hard
nut
,
was
thrown
into
a
state
of
embarrassed
alarm
that
made
everything
dim
to
him
except
the
feeling
that
he
would
rather
not
have
anything
to
do
with
Latin
;
of
course
he
answered
,
"
Roast
-
beef
,
"
whereupon
there
followed
much
laughter
and
some
practical
joking
with
the
plates
,
from
which
Tom
gathered
that
he
had
in
some
mysterious
way
refused
beef
,
and
,
in
fact
,
made
himself
appear
"
a
silly
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
could
have
seen
a
fellow
-
pupil
undergo
these
painful
operations
and
survive
them
in
good
spirits
,
he
might
sooner
have
taken
them
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
two
expensive
forms
of
education
,
either
of
which
a
parent
may
procure
for
his
son
by
sending
him
as
solitary
pupil
to
a
clergyman
:
<EOS>
one
is
the
enjoyment
of
the
reverend
gentleman
's
undivided
neglect
;
the
other
is
the
endurance
of
the
reverend
gentleman
's
undivided
attention
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
latter
privilege
for
which
Mr.
Tulliver
paid
a
high
price
in
Tom
's
initiatory
months
at
King
's
Lorton
.
  
<EOS>
That
respectable
miller
and
maltster
had
left
Tom
behind
,
and
driven
homeward
in
a
state
of
great
mental
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
He
considered
that
it
was
a
happy
moment
for
him
when
he
had
thought
of
asking
Riley
's
advice
about
a
tutor
for
Tom
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
's
eyes
were
so
wide
open
,
and
he
talked
in
such
an
off
-
hand
,
matter
-
of
-
fact
way
,
answering
every
difficult
,
slow
remark
of
Mr.
Tulliver
's
with
,
"
<EOS>
I
see
,
my
good
sir
,
I
see
"
;
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
to
be
sure
"
;
"
You
want
your
son
to
be
a
man
who
will
make
his
way
in
the
world
,
"
 
that
Mr.
Tulliver
was
delighted
to
find
in
him
a
clergyman
whose
knowledge
was
so
applicable
to
the
every
-
day
affairs
of
this
life
.
<EOS>
Except
Counsellor
Wylde
,
whom
he
had
heard
at
the
last
sessions
,
Mr.
Tulliver
thought
the
Rev.
Mr
Stelling
was
the
shrewdest
fellow
he
had
ever
met
with
,
 
not
unlike
Wylde
,
in
fact
;
he
had
the
same
way
of
sticking
his
thumbs
in
the
armholes
of
his
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
was
not
by
any
means
an
exception
in
mistaking
brazenness
for
shrewdness
;
most
laymen
thought
Stelling
shrewd
,
and
a
man
of
remarkable
powers
generally
;
it
was
chiefly
by
his
clerical
brethren
that
he
was
considered
rather
a
full
fellow
.
<EOS>
But
he
told
Mr.
Tulliver
several
stories
about
"
Swing
"
and
incendiarism
,
and
asked
his
advice
about
feeding
pigs
in
so
thoroughly
secular
and
judicious
a
manner
,
with
so
much
polished
glibness
of
tongue
,
that
the
miller
thought
,
here
was
the
very
thing
he
wanted
for
Tom
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
doubt
this
first
-
rate
man
was
acquainted
with
every
branch
of
information
,
and
knew
exactly
what
Tom
must
learn
in
order
to
become
a
match
for
the
lawyers
,
which
poor
Mr.
Tulliver
himself
did
_
<EOS>
not
_
know
,
and
so
was
necessarily
thrown
for
self
-
direction
on
this
wide
kind
of
inference
.
<EOS>
It
is
hardly
fair
to
laugh
at
him
,
for
I
have
known
much
more
highly
instructed
persons
than
he
make
inferences
quite
as
wide
,
and
not
at
all
wiser
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
finding
that
Mrs.
Stelling
's
views
as
to
the
airing
of
linen
and
the
frequent
recurrence
of
hunger
in
a
growing
boy
entirely
coincided
with
her
own
;
moreover
,
that
Mrs.
Stelling
,
though
so
young
a
woman
,
and
only
anticipating
her
second
confinement
,
had
gone
through
very
nearly
the
same
experience
as
herself
with
regard
to
the
behavior
and
fundamental
character
of
the
monthly
nurse
,
 
she
expressed
great
contentment
to
her
husband
,
when
they
drove
away
,
at
leaving
Tom
with
a
woman
who
,
in
spite
of
her
youth
,
seemed
quite
sensible
and
motherly
,
and
asked
advice
as
prettily
as
could
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
must
be
very
well
off
,
though
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
"
for
everything
's
as
nice
as
can
be
all
over
the
house
,
and
that
watered
silk
<EOS>
she
had
on
cost
a
pretty
penny
.
<EOS>
Sister
Pullet
has
got
one
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
"
he
's
got
some
income
besides
the
curacy
,
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
her
father
allows
'em
something
.
<EOS>
There
's
Tom
"
ull
<EOS>
be
another
hundred
to
him
,
and
not
much
trouble
either
,
by
his
own
account
;
he
says
teaching
comes
natural
to
him
.
<EOS>
That
's
wonderful
,
now

"
added
Mr.
Tulliver
,
turning
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
giving
his
horse
a
meditative
tickling
on
the
flank
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
because
teaching
came
naturally
to
Mr.
Stelling
,
that
he
set
about
it
with
that
uniformity
of
method
and
independence
of
circumstances
which
distinguish
the
actions
of
animals
understood
to
be
under
the
immediate
teaching
of
nature
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Broderip
's
amiable
beaver
,
as
that
charming
naturalist
tells
us
,
busied
himself
as
earnestly
in
constructing
a
dam
,
in
a
room
up
three
pair
of
stairs
in
London
,
as
if
he
had
been
laying
his
foundation
in
a
stream
or
lake
in
Upper
Canada
.
<EOS>
It
was
"
Binny
's
"
function
to
build
;
the
absence
of
water
or
of
possible
progeny
was
an
accident
for
which
he
was
not
accountable
.
<EOS>
With
the
same
unerring
instinct
Mr.
Stelling
set
to
work
at
his
natural
method
of
instilling
the
Eton
Grammar
and
Euclid
into
the
mind
of
Tom
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
This
,
he
considered
,
was
the
only
basis
of
solid
instruction
;
all
other
means
of
education
were
mere
charlatanism
,
and
could
produce
nothing
better
than
smatterers
.
<EOS>
Fixed
on
this
firm
basis
,
a
man
might
observe
the
display
of
various
or
special
knowledge
made
by
irregularly
educated
people
with
a
pitying
smile
;
all
that
sort
of
thing
was
very
well
,
but
it
was
impossible
these
people
could
form
sound
opinions
.
<EOS>
In
holding
this
conviction
Mr.
Stelling
was
not
biassed
,
as
some
tutors
have
been
,
by
the
excessive
accuracy
or
extent
of
his
own
scholarship
;
and
as
to
his
views
about
Euclid
,
no
opinion
could
have
been
freer
from
personal
partiality
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
was
very
far
from
being
led
astray
by
enthusiasm
,
either
religious
or
intellectual
;
on
the
other
hand
,
he
had
no
secret
belief
that
everything
was
humbug
.
<EOS>
He
thought
religion
was
a
very
excellent
thing
,
and
Aristotle
a
great
authority
,
and
deaneries
and
prebends
useful
institutions
,
and
Great
Britain
the
providential
bulwark
of
Protestantism
,
and
faith
in
the
unseen
a
great
support
to
afflicted
minds
;
he
believed
in
all
these
things
,
as
a
Swiss
hotel
-
keeper
believes
in
the
beauty
of
the
scenery
around
him
,
and
in
the
pleasure
it
gives
to
artistic
visitors
.
<EOS>
And
in
the
same
way
Mr.
Stelling
believed
in
his
method
of
education
;
he
had
no
doubt
that
he
was
doing
the
very
best
thing
for
Mr.
Tulliver
's
boy
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
when
the
miller
talked
of
"
mapping
"
and
"
summing
"
in
a
vague
and
diffident
manner
,
Mr
Stelling
had
set
his
mind
at
rest
by
an
assurance
that
he
understood
what
was
wanted
;
for
how
was
it
possible
the
good
man
could
form
any
reasonable
judgment
about
the
matter
?
<EOS>
Mr
Stelling
's
duty
was
to
teach
the
lad
in
the
only
right
way
,
 
indeed
he
knew
no
other
;
he
had
not
wasted
his
time
in
the
acquirement
of
anything
abnormal
.
  
<EOS>
He
very
soon
set
down
poor
Tom
as
a
thoroughly
stupid
lad
;
for
though
by
hard
labor
he
could
get
particular
declensions
into
his
brain
,
anything
so
abstract
as
the
relation
between
cases
and
terminations
could
by
no
means
get
such
a
lodgment
there
as
to
enable
him
to
recognize
a
chance
genitive
or
dative
.
<EOS>
This
struck
Mr.
Stelling
as
something
more
than
natural
stupidity
;
he
suspected
obstinacy
,
or
at
any
rate
indifference
,
and
lectured
Tom
severely
on
his
want
of
thorough
application
.
<EOS>
"
You
feel
no
interest
in
what
you
're
doing
,
sir
,
"
Mr.
Stelling
would
say
,
and
the
reproach
was
painfully
true
.
<EOS>
Tom
had
never
found
any
difficulty
in
discerning
a
pointer
from
a
setter
,
when
once
he
had
been
told
the
distinction
,
and
his
perceptive
powers
were
not
at
all
deficient
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
they
were
quite
as
strong
as
those
of
the
Rev.
Mr.
Stelling
;
for
Tom
could
predict
with
accuracy
what
number
of
horses
were
cantering
behind
him
,
he
could
throw
a
stone
right
into
the
centre
of
a
given
ripple
,
he
could
guess
to
a
fraction
how
many
lengths
of
his
stick
it
would
take
to
reach
across
the
playground
,
and
could
draw
almost
perfect
squares
on
his
slate
without
any
measurement
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Stelling
took
no
note
of
these
things
;
he
only
observed
that
Tom
's
faculties
failed
him
before
the
abstractions
hideously
symbolized
to
him
in
the
pages
of
the
Eton
Grammar
,
and
that
he
was
in
a
state
bordering
on
idiocy
with
regard
to
the
demonstration
that
two
given
triangles
must
be
equal
,
though
he
could
discern
with
great
promptitude
and
certainty
the
fact
that
they
_
were
_
equal
.
<EOS>
Whence
Mr.
Stelling
concluded
that
Tom
's
brain
,
being
peculiarly
impervious
to
etymology
and
demonstrations
,
was
peculiarly
in
need
of
being
ploughed
and
harrowed
by
these
patent
implements
;
it
was
his
favorite
metaphor
,
that
the
classics
and
geometry
constituted
that
culture
of
the
mind
which
prepared
it
for
the
reception
of
any
subsequent
crop
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
against
Mr.
Stelling
's
theory
;
if
we
are
to
have
one
regimen
for
all
minds
,
his
seems
to
me
as
good
as
any
other
.
<EOS>
I
only
know
it
turned
out
as
uncomfortably
for
Tom
Tulliver
as
if
he
had
been
plied
with
cheese
in
order
to
remedy
a
gastric
weakness
which
prevented
him
from
digesting
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
astonishing
what
a
different
result
one
gets
by
changing
the
metaphor
!
<EOS>
Once
call
the
brain
an
intellectual
stomach
,
and
one
's
ingenious
conception
of
the
classics
and
geometry
as
ploughs
and
harrows
seems
to
settle
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
then
it
is
open
to
some
one
else
to
follow
great
authorities
,
and
call
the
mind
a
sheet
of
white
paper
or
a
mirror
,
in
which
case
one
's
knowledge
of
the
digestive
process
becomes
quite
irrelevant
.
<EOS>
It
was
doubtless
an
ingenious
idea
to
call
the
camel
the
ship
of
the
desert
,
but
it
would
hardly
lead
one
far
in
training
that
useful
beast
.
<EOS>
O
Aristotle
!
<EOS>
if
you
had
had
the
advantage
of
being
"
the
freshest
modern
"
instead
of
the
greatest
ancient
,
would
you
not
have
mingled
your
praise
of
metaphorical
speech
,
as
a
sign
of
high
intelligence
,
with
a
lamentation
that
intelligence
so
rarely
shows
itself
in
speech
without
metaphor
,
 
that
we
can
so
seldom
declare
what
a
thing
is
,
except
by
saying
it
is
something
else
?
  
<EOS>
Tom
Tulliver
,
being
abundant
in
no
form
of
speech
,
did
not
use
any
metaphor
to
declare
his
views
as
to
the
nature
of
Latin
;
he
never
called
it
an
instrument
of
torture
;
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
got
on
some
way
in
the
next
half
-
year
,
and
in
the
Delectus
,
that
he
was
advanced
enough
to
call
it
a
"
bore
"
and
"
beastly
stuff
.
<EOS>
"
At
present
,
in
relation
to
this
demand
that
he
should
learn
Latin
declensions
and
conjugations
,
Tom
was
in
a
state
of
as
blank
unimaginativeness
concerning
the
cause
and
tendency
of
his
sufferings
,
as
if
he
had
been
an
innocent
shrewmouse
imprisoned
in
the
split
trunk
of
an
ash
-
tree
in
order
to
cure
lameness
in
cattle
.
<EOS>
It
is
doubtless
almost
incredible
to
instructed
minds
of
the
present
day
that
a
boy
of
twelve
,
not
belonging
strictly
to
"
the
masses
,
"
who
are
now
understood
to
have
the
monopoly
of
mental
darkness
,
should
have
had
no
distinct
idea
how
there
came
to
be
such
a
thing
as
Latin
on
this
earth
;
yet
so
it
was
with
Tom
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
taken
a
long
while
to
make
conceivable
to
him
that
there
ever
existed
a
people
who
bought
and
sold
sheep
and
oxen
,
and
transacted
the
every
-
day
affairs
of
life
,
through
the
medium
of
this
language
;
and
still
longer
to
make
him
understand
why
he
should
be
called
upon
to
learn
it
,
when
its
connection
with
those
affairs
had
become
entirely
latent
.
<EOS>
So
far
as
Tom
had
gained
any
acquaintance
with
the
Romans
at
Mr.
Jacob
's
academy
,
his
knowledge
was
strictly
correct
,
but
it
went
no
farther
than
the
fact
that
they
were
"
in
the
New
Testament
"
;
and
Mr.
Stelling
was
not
the
man
to
enfeeble
and
emasculate
his
pupil
's
mind
by
simplifying
and
explaining
,
or
to
reduce
the
tonic
effect
of
etymology
by
mixing
it
with
smattering
,
extraneous
information
,
such
as
is
given
to
girls
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
,
strange
to
say
,
under
this
vigorous
treatment
Tom
became
more
like
a
girl
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
before
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
large
share
of
pride
,
which
had
hitherto
found
itself
very
comfortable
in
the
world
,
despising
Old
Goggles
,
and
reposing
in
the
sense
of
unquestioned
rights
;
but
now
this
same
pride
met
with
nothing
but
bruises
and
crushings
.
<EOS>
Tom
was
too
clear
-
sighted
not
to
be
aware
that
Mr.
Stelling
's
standard
of
things
was
quite
different
,
was
certainly
something
higher
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
than
that
of
the
people
he
had
been
living
amongst
,
and
that
,
brought
in
contact
with
it
,
he
,
Tom
Tulliver
,
appeared
uncouth
and
stupid
;
he
was
by
no
means
indifferent
to
this
,
and
his
pride
got
into
an
uneasy
condition
which
quite
nullified
his
boyish
self
-
satisfaction
,
and
gave
him
something
of
the
girl
's
susceptibility
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
very
firm
,
not
to
say
obstinate
,
disposition
,
but
there
was
no
brute
-
like
rebellion
and
recklessness
in
his
nature
;
the
human
sensibilities
predominated
,
and
if
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
he
could
enable
himself
to
show
some
quickness
at
his
lessons
,
and
so
acquire
Mr.
Stelling
's
approbation
,
by
standing
on
one
leg
for
an
inconvenient
length
of
time
,
or
rapping
his
head
moderately
against
the
wall
,
or
any
voluntary
action
of
that
sort
,
he
would
certainly
have
tried
it
.
<EOS>
But
no
;
Tom
had
never
heard
that
these
measures
would
brighten
the
understanding
,
or
strengthen
the
verbal
memory
;
and
he
was
not
given
to
hypothesis
and
experiment
.
<EOS>
It
did
occur
to
him
that
he
could
perhaps
get
some
help
by
praying
for
it
;
but
as
the
prayers
he
said
every
evening
were
forms
learned
by
heart
,
he
rather
shrank
from
the
novelty
and
irregularity
of
introducing
an
extempore
passage
on
a
topic
of
petition
for
which
he
was
not
aware
of
any
precedent
.
<EOS>
But
one
day
,
when
he
had
broken
down
,
for
the
fifth
time
,
in
the
supines
of
the
third
conjugation
,
and
Mr.
Stelling
,
convinced
that
this
must
be
carelessness
,
since
it
transcended
the
bounds
of
possible
stupidity
,
had
lectured
him
very
seriously
,
pointing
out
that
if
he
failed
to
seize
the
present
golden
opportunity
of
learning
supines
,
he
would
have
to
regret
it
when
he
became
a
man
,
 
Tom
,
more
miserable
than
usual
,
determined
to
try
his
sole
resource
;
and
that
evening
,
after
his
usual
form
of
prayer
for
his
parents
and
"
little
sister
"
(
he
had
begun
to
pray
for
Maggie
when
she
was
a
baby
)
,
and
that
he
might
be
able
always
to
keep
God
's
commandments
,
he
added
,
in
the
same
low
whisper
,
"
and
please
to
make
me
always
remember
my
Latin
.
"
<EOS>
He
paused
a
little
to
consider
how
he
should
pray
about
Euclid
 
whether
he
should
ask
to
see
what
it
meant
,
or
whether
there
was
any
other
mental
state
which
would
be
more
applicable
to
the
case
.
<EOS>
But
at
last
he
added
:
"
<EOS>
And
make
Mr.
Stelling
say
I
sha'n"t
do
Euclid
any
more
.
<EOS>
Amen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
fact
that
he
got
through
his
supines
without
mistake
the
next
day
,
encouraged
him
to
persevere
in
this
appendix
to
his
prayers
,
and
neutralized
any
scepticism
that
might
have
arisen
from
Mr.
Stelling
's
continued
demand
for
Euclid
.
<EOS>
But
his
faith
broke
down
under
the
apparent
absence
of
all
help
when
he
got
into
the
irregular
verbs
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
clear
that
Tom
's
despair
under
the
caprices
of
the
present
tense
did
not
constitute
a
_
nodus
<EOS>
_
worthy
of
interference
,
and
since
this
was
the
climax
of
his
difficulties
,
where
was
the
use
of
praying
for
help
any
longer
?
<EOS>
He
made
up
his
mind
to
this
conclusion
in
one
of
his
dull
,
lonely
evenings
,
which
he
spent
in
the
study
,
preparing
his
lessons
for
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
apt
to
get
dim
over
the
page
,
though
he
hated
crying
,
and
was
ashamed
of
it
;
he
could
n't
help
thinking
with
some
affection
even
of
Spouncer
,
whom
he
used
to
fight
and
quarrel
with
;
he
would
have
felt
at
home
with
Spouncer
,
and
in
a
condition
of
superiority
.
<EOS>
And
then
the
mill
,
and
the
river
,
and
Yap
pricking
up
his
ears
,
ready
to
obey
the
least
sign
when
Tom
said
,
"
Hoigh
!
"
would
all
come
before
him
in
a
sort
of
calenture
,
when
his
fingers
played
absently
in
his
pocket
with
his
great
knife
and
his
coil
of
whipcord
,
and
other
relics
of
the
past
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
,
as
I
said
,
had
never
been
so
much
like
a
girl
in
his
life
before
,
and
at
that
epoch
of
irregular
verbs
his
spirit
was
further
depressed
by
a
new
means
of
mental
development
which
had
been
thought
of
for
him
out
of
school
hours
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Stelling
had
lately
had
her
second
baby
,
and
as
nothing
could
be
more
salutary
for
a
boy
than
to
feel
himself
useful
,
Mrs.
Stelling
considered
she
was
doing
Tom
a
service
by
setting
him
to
watch
the
little
cherub
Laura
while
the
nurse
was
occupied
with
the
sickly
baby
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
a
pretty
employment
for
Tom
to
take
little
Laura
out
in
the
sunniest
hour
of
the
autumn
day
;
it
would
help
to
make
him
feel
that
Lorton
Parsonage
was
a
home
for
him
,
and
that
he
was
one
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
The
little
cherub
Laura
,
not
being
an
accomplished
walker
at
present
,
had
a
ribbon
fastened
round
her
waist
,
by
which
Tom
held
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
little
dog
during
the
minutes
in
which
she
chose
to
walk
;
but
as
these
were
rare
,
he
was
for
the
most
part
carrying
this
fine
child
round
and
round
the
garden
,
within
sight
of
Mrs.
Stelling
's
window
,
according
to
orders
.
<EOS>
If
any
one
considers
this
unfair
and
even
oppressive
toward
Tom
,
I
beg
him
to
consider
that
there
are
feminine
virtues
which
are
with
difficulty
combined
,
even
if
they
are
not
incompatible
.
<EOS>
When
the
wife
of
a
poor
curate
contrives
,
under
all
her
disadvantages
,
to
dress
extremely
well
,
and
to
have
a
style
of
coiffure
which
requires
that
her
nurse
shall
occasionally
officiate
as
lady's
-
maid
;
when
,
moreover
,
her
dinner
-
parties
and
her
drawing
-
room
show
that
effort
at
elegance
and
completeness
of
appointment
to
which
ordinary
women
might
imagine
a
large
income
necessary
,
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
expect
of
her
that
she
should
employ
a
second
nurse
,
or
even
act
as
a
nurse
herself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
knew
better
;
he
saw
that
his
wife
did
wonders
already
,
and
was
proud
of
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
certainly
not
the
best
thing
in
the
world
for
young
Tulliver
's
gait
to
carry
a
heavy
child
,
but
he
had
plenty
of
exercise
in
long
walks
with
himself
,
and
next
half
-
year
Mr.
Stelling
would
see
about
having
a
drilling
-
master
.
<EOS>
Among
the
many
means
whereby
Mr.
Stelling
intended
to
be
more
fortunate
than
the
bulk
of
his
fellow
-
men
,
he
had
entirely
given
up
that
of
having
his
own
way
in
his
own
house
.
<EOS>
What
then
?
<EOS>
He
had
married
"
as
kind
a
little
soul
as
ever
breathed
,
"
according
to
Mr.
Riley
,
who
had
been
acquainted
with
Mrs.
Stelling
's
blond
ringlets
and
smiling
demeanor
throughout
her
maiden
life
,
and
on
the
strength
of
that
knowledge
would
have
been
ready
any
day
to
pronounce
that
whatever
domestic
differences
might
arise
in
her
married
life
must
be
entirely
Mr.
Stelling
's
fault
.
  
<EOS>
If
Tom
had
had
a
worse
disposition
,
he
would
certainly
have
hated
the
little
cherub
Laura
,
but
he
was
too
kind
-
hearted
a
lad
for
that
;
there
was
too
much
in
him
of
the
fibre
that
turns
to
true
manliness
,
and
to
protecting
pity
for
the
weak
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
he
hated
Mrs.
Stelling
,
and
contracted
a
lasting
dislike
to
pale
blond
ringlets
and
broad
plaits
,
as
directly
associated
with
haughtiness
of
manner
,
and
a
frequent
reference
to
other
people
's
"
duty
.
"
<EOS>
But
he
could
n't
help
playing
with
little
Laura
,
and
liking
to
amuse
her
;
he
even
sacrificed
his
percussion
-
caps
for
her
sake
,
in
despair
of
their
ever
serving
a
greater
purpose
,
 
thinking
the
small
flash
and
bang
would
delight
her
,
and
thereby
drawing
down
on
himself
a
rebuke
from
Mrs.
Stelling
for
teaching
her
child
to
play
with
fire
.
<EOS>
Laura
was
a
sort
of
playfellow
 
<EOS>
and
oh
,
how
Tom
longed
for
playfellows
!
<EOS>
In
his
secret
heart
he
yearned
to
have
Maggie
with
him
,
and
was
almost
ready
to
dote
on
her
exasperating
acts
of
forgetfulness
;
though
,
when
he
was
at
home
,
he
always
represented
it
as
a
great
favor
on
his
part
to
let
Maggie
trot
by
his
side
on
his
pleasure
excursions
.
  
<EOS>
And
before
this
dreary
half
-
year
was
ended
,
Maggie
actually
came
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Stelling
had
given
a
general
invitation
for
the
little
girl
to
come
and
stay
with
her
brother
;
so
when
Mr.
Tulliver
drove
over
to
King
's
Lorton
late
in
October
,
Maggie
came
too
,
with
the
sense
that
she
was
taking
a
great
journey
,
and
beginning
to
see
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
was
Mr.
Tulliver
's
first
visit
to
see
Tom
,
for
the
lad
must
learn
not
to
think
too
much
about
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
lad
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
to
Tom
,
when
Mr.
Stelling
had
left
the
room
to
announce
the
arrival
to
his
wife
,
and
Maggie
had
begun
to
kiss
Tom
freely
,
"
you
look
rarely
!
<EOS>
School
agrees
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
wished
he
had
looked
rather
ill
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
_
am
_
<EOS>
well
,
father
,
"
said
Tom
;
"
I
wish
you
'd
ask
Mr.
Stelling
not
to
let
me
do
Euclid
;
it
brings
on
the
toothache
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
The
toothache
was
the
only
malady
to
which
Tom
had
ever
been
subject
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Euclid
,
my
lad
,
 
why
,
what
's
that
?
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
;
it
's
definitions
,
and
axioms
,
and
triangles
,
and
things
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
book
I
've
got
to
learn
in
 
<EOS>
there
's
no
sense
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
,
go
!
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
reprovingly
;
"
you
must
n't
say
so
.
<EOS>
You
must
learn
what
your
master
tells
you
.
<EOS>
He
knows
what
it
's
right
for
you
to
learn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
I
'll
_
help
you
now
,
Tom
,
"
said
Maggie
,
with
a
little
air
of
patronizing
consolation
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
come
to
stay
ever
so
long
,
if
Mrs.
Stelling
asks
me
.
<EOS>
I
've
brought
my
box
and
my
pinafores
,
have
n't
I
,
father
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
You
_
help
me
,
you
silly
little
thing
!
"
<EOS>
said
Tom
,
in
such
high
spirits
at
this
announcement
that
he
quite
enjoyed
the
idea
of
confounding
Maggie
by
showing
her
a
page
of
Euclid
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
see
you
doing
one
of
_
<EOS>
my
_
lessons
!
<EOS>
Why
,
I
learn
Latin
too
!
<EOS>
Girls
never
learn
such
things
.
<EOS>
They
're
too
silly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
Latin
is
very
well
,
"
said
Maggie
,
confidently
,
"
Latin
's
a
language
.
<EOS>
There
are
Latin
words
in
the
Dictionary
.
<EOS>
There
's
bonus
,
a
gift
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
you
're
just
wrong
there
,
Miss
Maggie
!
"
<EOS>
said
Tom
,
secretly
astonished
.
<EOS>
"
You
think
you
're
very
wise
!
<EOS>
But
"
bonus
"
means
"
good
,
"
as
it
happens
,
 
bonus
,
bona
,
bonum
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
that
's
no
reason
why
it
should
n't
mean
"
gift
,
"
"
said
Maggie
,
stoutly
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
mean
several
things
;
almost
every
word
does
.
<EOS>
There
's
"
lawn
,
"
 
<EOS>
it
means
the
grass
-
plot
,
as
well
as
the
stuff
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
are
made
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
done
,
little
"
un
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
laughing
,
while
Tom
felt
rather
disgusted
with
Maggie
's
knowingness
,
though
beyond
measure
cheerful
at
the
thought
that
she
was
going
to
stay
with
him
.
<EOS>
Her
conceit
would
soon
be
overawed
by
the
actual
inspection
of
his
books
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Stelling
,
in
her
pressing
invitation
,
did
not
mention
a
longer
time
than
a
week
for
Maggie
's
stay
;
but
Mr.
Stelling
,
who
took
her
between
his
knees
,
and
asked
her
where
she
stole
her
dark
eyes
from
,
insisted
that
she
must
stay
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
Maggie
thought
Mr.
Stelling
was
a
charming
man
,
and
Mr.
Tulliver
was
quite
proud
to
leave
his
little
wench
where
she
would
have
an
opportunity
of
showing
her
cleverness
to
appreciating
strangers
.
<EOS>
So
it
was
agreed
that
she
should
not
be
fetched
home
till
the
end
of
the
fortnight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
then
,
come
with
me
into
the
study
,
Maggie
,
"
said
Tom
,
as
their
father
drove
away
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
shake
and
toss
your
head
now
for
,
you
silly
?
"
<EOS>
he
continued
;
for
though
her
hair
was
now
under
a
new
dispensation
,
and
was
brushed
smoothly
behind
her
ears
,
she
seemed
still
in
imagination
to
be
tossing
it
out
of
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
It
makes
you
look
as
if
you
were
crazy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
"
said
Maggie
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
tease
me
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
books
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
as
she
saw
the
bookcases
in
the
study
.
<EOS>
"
How
I
should
like
to
have
as
many
books
as
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
could
n't
read
one
of
'
em
,
"
said
Tom
,
triumphantly
.
<EOS>
"
They
're
all
Latin
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
they
are
n't
,
"
said
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
read
the
back
of
this
,
 
"
History
of
the
Decline
and
Fall
of
the
Roman
Empire
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
what
does
that
mean
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Tom
,
wagging
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
could
soon
find
out
,
"
said
Maggie
,
scornfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
look
inside
,
and
see
what
it
was
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
not
,
Miss
Maggie
,
"
said
Tom
,
seeing
her
hand
on
the
volume
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
lets
nobody
touch
his
books
without
leave
,
and
_
I
_
shall
catch
it
,
if
you
take
it
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
very
well
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
all
_
your
_
books
,
then
,
"
said
Maggie
,
turning
to
throw
her
arms
<EOS>
round
Tom
's
neck
,
and
rub
his
cheek
with
her
small
round
nose
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
,
in
the
gladness
of
his
heart
at
having
dear
old
Maggie
to
dispute
with
and
crow
over
again
,
seized
her
round
the
waist
,
and
began
to
jump
with
her
round
the
large
library
table
.
<EOS>
Away
they
jumped
with
more
and
more
vigor
,
till
Maggie
's
hair
flew
from
behind
her
ears
,
and
twirled
about
like
an
animated
mop
.
<EOS>
But
the
revolutions
round
the
table
became
more
and
more
irregular
in
their
sweep
,
till
at
last
reaching
Mr.
Stelling
's
reading
stand
,
they
sent
it
thundering
down
with
its
heavy
lexicons
to
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Happily
it
was
the
ground
-
floor
,
and
the
study
was
a
one
-
storied
wing
to
the
house
,
so
that
the
downfall
made
no
alarming
resonance
,
though
Tom
stood
dizzy
and
aghast
for
a
few
minutes
,
dreading
the
appearance
of
Mr.
or
Mrs.
Stelling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
say
,
Maggie
,
"
said
Tom
at
last
,
lifting
up
the
stand
,
"
we
must
keep
quiet
here
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
If
we
break
anything
Mrs.
Stelling'll
make
us
cry
peccavi
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
said
Maggie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
the
Latin
for
a
good
scolding
,
"
said
Tom
,
not
without
some
pride
in
his
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
a
cross
woman
?
"
said
Maggie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
Tom
,
with
an
emphatic
nod
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
all
women
are
crosser
than
men
,
"
said
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Aunt
Glegg
's
a
great
deal
crosser
than
uncle
Glegg
,
and
mother
scolds
me
more
than
father
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
_
you
'll
_
be
a
woman
some
day
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
so
_
you
_
need
n't
talk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
be
a
_
clever
_
woman
,
"
said
Maggie
,
with
a
toss
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
dare
say
,
and
a
nasty
conceited
thing
.
<EOS>
Everybody'll
hate
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
ought
n't
to
hate
me
,
Tom
;
it
'll
be
very
wicked
of
you
,
for
I
shall
be
your
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
if
you
're
a
nasty
disagreeable
thing
I
_
shall
_
hate
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
,
Tom
,
you
wo
n't

<EOS>
I
sha'n"t
be
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
very
good
to
you
,
and
I
shall
be
good
to
everybody
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
hate
me
really
,
will
you
,
Tom
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
bother
!
<EOS>
never
mind
!
<EOS>
Come
,
it
's
time
for
me
to
learn
my
lessons
.
<EOS>
See
here
!
<EOS>
what
I
've
got
to
do
,
"
said
Tom
,
drawing
Maggie
toward
him
and
showing
her
his
theorem
,
while
she
pushed
her
hair
behind
her
ears
,
and
prepared
herself
to
prove
her
capability
of
helping
him
in
Euclid
.
<EOS>
She
began
to
read
with
full
confidence
in
her
own
powers
,
but
presently
,
becoming
quite
bewildered
,
her
face
flushed
with
irritation
.
<EOS>
It
was
unavoidable
;
she
must
confess
her
incompetency
,
and
she
was
not
fond
of
humiliation
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
nonsense
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
and
very
ugly
stuff
;
nobody
need
want
to
make
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
there
,
now
,
Miss
Maggie
!
<EOS>
"
said
Tom
,
drawing
the
book
away
,
and
wagging
his
head
at
her
,
"
You
see
you
're
not
so
clever
as
you
thought
you
were
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
said
Maggie
,
pouting
,
"
I
dare
say
I
could
make
it
out
,
if
I
'd
learned
what
goes
before
,
as
you
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
that
's
what
you
just
could
n't
,
Miss
Wisdom
,
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
it
's
all
the
harder
<EOS>
when
you
know
what
goes
before
;
for
then
you
've
got
to
say
what
definition
3
is
,
and
what
axiom
V.
is
.
<EOS>
But
get
along
with
you
now
;
I
must
go
on
with
this
.
<EOS>
Here
's
the
Latin
Grammar
.
<EOS>
See
what
you
can
make
of
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
found
the
Latin
Grammar
quite
soothing
after
her
mathematical
mortification
;
for
she
delighted
in
new
words
,
and
quickly
found
that
there
was
an
English
Key
at
the
end
,
which
would
make
her
very
wise
about
Latin
,
at
slight
expense
.
<EOS>
She
presently
made
up
her
mind
to
skip
the
rules
in
the
Syntax
,
the
examples
became
so
absorbing
.
<EOS>
These
mysterious
sentences
,
snatched
from
an
unknown
context
,
 
like
strange
horns
of
beasts
,
and
leaves
of
unknown
plants
,
brought
from
some
far
-
off
region
,
 
gave
boundless
scope
to
her
imagination
,
and
were
all
the
more
fascinating
because
they
were
in
a
peculiar
tongue
of
their
own
,
which
she
could
learn
to
interpret
.
<EOS>
It
was
really
very
interesting
,
the
Latin
Grammar
that
Tom
had
said
no
girls
could
learn
;
and
she
was
proud
because
she
found
it
interesting
.
<EOS>
The
most
fragmentary
examples
were
her
favourites
.
<EOS>
_
Mors
omnibus
est
communis
_
would
have
been
jejune
,
only
she
liked
to
know
the
Latin
;
but
the
fortunate
gentleman
whom
every
one
congratulated
because
he
had
a
son
"
endowed
with
_
<EOS>
such
_
<EOS>
a
disposition
"
afforded
her
a
great
deal
of
pleasant
conjecture
,
and
she
was
quite
lost
in
the
"
thick
grove
penetrable
by
no
star
,
"
when
Tom
called
out
,
    
"
Now
,
then
,
Magsie
,
give
us
the
Grammar
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Tom
,
it
's
such
a
pretty
book
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
as
she
jumped
out
of
the
large
arm
-
chair
to
give
it
him
;
"
it
's
much
prettier
than
the
Dictionary
.
<EOS>
I
could
learn
Latin
very
soon
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
it
's
at
all
hard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
know
what
you
've
been
doing
,
"
said
Tom
;
"
you
've
been
reading
the
English
at
the
end
.
<EOS>
Any
donkey
can
do
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
seized
the
book
and
opened
it
with
a
determined
and
business
-
like
air
,
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
had
a
lesson
to
learn
which
no
donkeys
would
find
themselves
equal
to
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
rather
piqued
,
turned
to
the
bookcases
to
amuse
herself
with
puzzling
out
the
titles
.
  
<EOS>
Presently
Tom
called
to
her
:
"
<EOS>
Here
,
Magsie
,
come
and
hear
if
I
can
say
this
.
<EOS>
Stand
at
that
end
of
the
table
,
where
Mr.
Stelling
sits
when
he
hears
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
obeyed
,
and
took
the
open
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
do
you
begin
,
Tom
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
begin
at
_
'
Appellativa

,
"
_
because
I
say
all
over
again
what
I
've
been
learning
this
week
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
sailed
along
pretty
well
for
three
lines
;
and
Maggie
was
beginning
to
forget
her
office
of
prompter
in
speculating
as
to
what
_
mas
_
could
mean
,
which
came
twice
over
,
when
he
stuck
fast
at
_
Sunt

<EOS>
_
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
tell
me

Maggie

"
  
"
No

said
Maggie
,
opening
her
mouth
and
shaking
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
Sunt
etiam

_
,
"
said
Tom
,
very
slowly
,
as
if
the
next
words
might
be
expected
to
come
sooner
when
he
gave
them
this
strong
hint
that
they
were
waited
for
.
  
<EOS>
"
C

"
said
Maggie
,
getting
impatient
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I

"
said
Tom
.
"
<EOS>
_
Ceu

,

;
Ferarum
_
 
_

_
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
took
his
pencil
and
made
several
hard
dots
with
it
on
his
book
-
cover
 
"
_
ferarum
_
   
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
oh
dear
,
Tom

"
said
Maggie
,
"
what
a
time
you
are
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Ut

"
_

_

"
  
"
No

said
Maggie
,
"
_
ut

<EOS>
_
   
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
yes
,
now
I
can
do

"
said
Tom
;
"
it
was
_
tigris

<EOS>
_
,
I
'd
forgotten
:
<EOS>
_
ut

,
volupes
;

Piscium
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
some
further
stammering
and
repetition
,
Tom
got
through
the
next
few
lines
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
then
,
"
he
said
,
"
the
next
is
what
I
've
just
learned
for
to

morrow
.
<EOS>
Give
me
hold
of
the

a
minute
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
some
whispered
gabbling
,
assisted
by
the
beating
of
his
fist
on
the
table
,
Tom
returned
the
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
Mascula

,
"
he
began
.
  
<EOS>
"
No

Tom

"
said
Maggie
,
"
that
does
n't
come
next

<EOS>
It

_

"
  
"
_
Creskens

<EOS>
_
"
exclaimed
Tom
,
with
a
derisive
laugh
,
for
Tom
had
learned
this
omitted
passage
for
his
yesterday
's
lesson
,
and
a
young
gentleman
does
not
require
an
intimate
or
extensive
acquaintance
with
Latin
before
he
can
feel
the
pitiable
absurdity
of
a
false
quantity
.
"
<EOS>
_
Creskens

<EOS>
_
<EOS>
What
a
little
silly
you
are
,
Maggie
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
need
n't
laugh
,
Tom
,
for
you
did
n't
remember
it
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
it
's
spelt
so
;
how
was
I
to
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Phee
-
e
-
e
-

<EOS>
I
told
you
girls
could
n't
learn
Latin
.
<EOS>
It
's
_
Nomen
<EOS>
non

_
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
well
,
then
,
"
said
Maggie
,
pouting
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
say
that
as
well
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
And
you
do
n't
mind
your
stops
.
<EOS>
For
you
ought
to
stop
twice
as
long
at
a
semicolon
as
you
do
at
a
comma
,
and
you
make
the
longest
stops
where
there
ought
to
be
no
stop
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
well
,
do
n't
chatter
.
<EOS>
Let
me
go
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
presently
fetched
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
evening
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
Maggie
became
so
animated
with
Mr.
Stelling
,
who
,
she
felt
sure
,
admired
her
cleverness
,
that
Tom
was
rather
amazed
and
alarmed
at
her
audacity
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
suddenly
subdued
by
Mr.
Stelling
's
alluding
to
a
little
girl
of
whom
he
had
heard
that
she
once
ran
away
to
the
gypsies
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
very
odd
little
girl
that
must
be
!
"
said
Mrs.
Stelling
,
meaning
to
be
playful
;
but
a
playfulness
that
turned
on
her
supposed
oddity
was
not
at
all
to
Maggie
's
taste
.
<EOS>
She
feared
that
Mr.
Stelling
,
after
all
,
did
not
think
much
of
her
,
and
went
to
bed
in
rather
low
spirits
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Stelling
,
she
felt
,
looked
at
her
as
if
she
thought
her
hair
was
very
ugly
because
it
hung
down
straight
behind
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
it
was
a
very
happy
fortnight
to
Maggie
,
this
visit
to
Tom
.
<EOS>
She
was
allowed
to
be
in
the
study
while
he
had
his
lessons
,
and
in
her
various
readings
got
very
deep
into
the
examples
in
the
Latin
Grammar
.
<EOS>
The
astronomer
who
hated
women
generally
caused
her
so
much
puzzling
speculation
that
she
one
day
asked
Mr.
Stelling
if
all
astronomers
hated
women
,
or
whether
it
was
only
this
particular
astronomer
.
<EOS>
But
forestalling
his
answer
,
she
said
,
    
"
I
suppose
it
's
all
astronomers
;
because
,
you
know
,
they
live
up
in
high
towers
,
and
if
the
women
came
there
they
might
talk
and
hinder
them
from
looking
at
the
stars
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
liked
her
prattle
immensely
,
and
they
were
on
the
best
terms
.
<EOS>
She
told
Tom
she
should
like
to
go
to
school
to
Mr.
Stelling
,
as
he
did
,
and
learn
just
the
same
things
.
<EOS>
She
knew
she
could
do
Euclid
,
for
she
had
looked
into
it
again
,
and
she
saw
what
A
B
C
meant
;
they
were
the
names
of
the
lines
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
you
could
n't
do
it
,
now
,
"
said
Tom
;
"
and
I
'll
just
ask
Mr.
Stelling
if
you
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mind
,
"
said
the
little
conceited
minx
,
"
I
'll
ask
him
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Stelling
,
"
she
said
,
that
same
evening
when
they
were
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
"
could
n't
I
do
Euclid
,
and
<EOS>
all
Tom
's
lessons
,
if
you
were
to
teach
me
instead
of
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
you
could
n't
,
"
said
Tom
,
indignantly
.
<EOS>
"
Girls
ca
n't
do
Euclid
;
can
they
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
can
pick
up
a
little
of
everything
,
I
dare
say
,
"
said
Mr.
Stelling
.
<EOS>
"
They
've
a
great
deal
of
superficial
cleverness
;
but
they
could
n't
go
far
into
anything
.
<EOS>
They
're
quick
and
shallow
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
,
delighted
with
this
verdict
,
telegraphed
his
triumph
by
wagging
his
head
at
Maggie
,
behind
Mr.
Stelling
's
chair
.
<EOS>
As
for
Maggie
,
she
had
hardly
ever
been
so
mortified
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
so
proud
to
be
called
"
quick
"
all
her
little
life
,
and
now
it
appeared
that
this
quickness
was
the
brand
of
inferiority
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
better
to
be
slow
,
like
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
Miss
Maggie
!
<EOS>
"
said
Tom
,
when
they
were
alone
;
"
you
see
it
's
not
such
a
fine
thing
to
be
quick
.
<EOS>
You
'll
never
go
far
into
anything
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
Maggie
was
so
oppressed
by
this
dreadful
destiny
that
she
had
no
spirit
for
a
retort
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
this
small
apparatus
of
shallow
quickness
was
fetched
away
in
the
gig
by
Luke
,
and
the
study
was
once
more
quite
lonely
for
Tom
,
he
missed
her
grievously
.
<EOS>
He
had
really
been
brighter
,
and
had
got
through
his
lessons
better
,
since
she
had
been
there
;
and
she
had
asked
Mr.
Stelling
so
many
questions
about
the
Roman
Empire
,
and
whether
there
really
ever
was
a
man
who
said
,
in
Latin
,
"
I
would
not
buy
it
for
a
farthing
or
a
rotten
nut
,
"
or
whether
that
had
only
been
turned
into
Latin
,
that
Tom
had
actually
come
to
a
dim
understanding
of
the
fact
that
there
had
once
been
people
upon
the
earth
who
were
so
fortunate
as
to
know
Latin
without
learning
it
through
the
medium
of
the
Eton
Grammar
.
<EOS>
This
luminous
idea
was
a
great
addition
to
his
historical
acquirements
during
this
half
-
year
,
which
were
otherwise
confined
to
an
epitomized
history
of
the
Jews
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
dreary
half
-
year
_
did
_
come
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
How
glad
Tom
was
to
see
the
last
yellow
leaves
fluttering
before
the
cold
wind
!
<EOS>
The
dark
afternoons
and
the
first
December
snow
seemed
to
him
far
livelier
than
the
August
sunshine
;
and
that
he
might
make
himself
the
surer
about
the
flight
of
the
days
that
were
carrying
him
homeward
,
he
stuck
twenty
-
one
sticks
deep
in
a
corner
of
the
garden
,
when
he
was
three
weeks
from
the
holidays
,
and
pulled
one
up
every
day
with
a
great
wrench
,
throwing
it
to
a
distance
with
a
vigor
of
will
which
would
have
carried
it
to
limbo
,
if
it
had
been
in
the
nature
of
sticks
to
travel
so
far
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
worth
purchasing
,
even
at
the
heavy
price
of
the
Latin
Grammar
,
the
happiness
of
seeing
the
bright
light
in
the
parlor
at
home
,
as
the
gig
passed
noiselessly
over
the
snow
-
covered
bridge
;
<EOS>
the
happiness
of
passing
from
the
cold
air
to
the
warmth
and
the
kisses
and
the
smiles
of
that
familiar
hearth
,
where
the
pattern
of
the
rug
and
the
grate
and
the
fire
-
irons
were
"
first
ideas
"
that
it
was
no
more
possible
to
criticise
than
the
solidity
and
extension
of
matter
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
sense
of
ease
like
the
ease
we
felt
in
those
scenes
where
we
were
born
,
where
objects
became
dear
to
us
before
we
had
known
the
labor
of
choice
,
and
where
the
outer
world
seemed
only
an
extension
of
our
own
personality
;
we
accepted
and
loved
it
as
we
accepted
our
own
sense
of
existence
and
our
own
limbs
.
<EOS>
Very
commonplace
,
even
ugly
,
that
furniture
of
our
early
home
might
look
if
it
were
put
up
to
auction
;
an
improved
taste
in
upholstery
scorns
it
;
and
is
not
the
striving
after
something
better
and
better
in
our
surroundings
the
grand
characteristic
that
distinguishes
man
from
the
brute
,
or
,
to
satisfy
a
scrupulous
accuracy
of
definition
,
that
distinguishes
the
British
man
from
the
foreign
brute
?
<EOS>
But
heaven
knows
where
that
striving
might
lead
us
,
if
our
affections
had
not
a
trick
of
twining
round
those
old
inferior
things
;
if
the
loves
and
sanctities
of
our
life
had
no
deep
immovable
roots
in
memory
.
<EOS>
One
's
delight
in
an
elderberry
bush
overhanging
the
confused
leafage
of
a
hedgerow
bank
,
as
a
more
gladdening
sight
than
the
finest
cistus
or
fuchsia
spreading
itself
on
the
softest
undulating
turf
,
is
an
entirely
unjustifiable
preference
to
a
nursery
-
gardener
,
or
to
any
of
those
regulated
minds
who
are
free
from
the
weakness
of
any
attachment
that
does
not
rest
on
a
demonstrable
superiority
of
qualities
.
<EOS>
And
there
is
no
better
reason
for
preferring
this
elderberry
bush
than
that
it
stirs
an
early
memory
;
that
it
is
no
novelty
in
my
life
,
speaking
to
me
merely
through
my
present
sensibilities
to
form
and
color
,
but
the
long
companion
of
my
existence
,
that
wove
itself
into
my
joys
when
joys

The
Christmas
Holidays
  
Fine
old
Christmas
,
with
the
snowy
hair
and
ruddy
face
,
had
done
his
duty
that
year
in
the
noblest
fashion
,
and
had
set
off
his
rich
gifts
of
warmth
and
color
with
all
the
heightening
contrast
of
frost
and
snow
.
  
<EOS>
Snow
lay
on
the
croft
and
river
-
bank
in
undulations
softer
than
the
limbs
of
infancy
;
it
lay
with
the
neatliest
finished
border
on
every
sloping
roof
,
making
the
dark
-
red
gables
stand
out
with
a
new
depth
of
color
;
it
weighed
heavily
on
the
laurels
and
fir
-
trees
,
till
it
fell
from
them
with
a
shuddering
sound
;
it
clothed
the
rough
turnip
-
field
with
whiteness
,
and
made
the
sheep
look
like
dark
blotches
;
the
gates
were
all
blocked
up
with
the
sloping
drifts
,
and
here
and
there
a
disregarded
four
-
footed
beast
stood
as
if
petrified
"
in
unrecumbent
sadness
"
;
there
was
no
gleam
,
no
shadow
,
for
the
heavens
,
too
<EOS>
,
were
one
still
,
pale
cloud
;
no
sound
or
motion
in
anything
but
the
dark
river
that
flowed
and
moaned
like
an
unresting
sorrow
.
<EOS>
But
old
Christmas
smiled
as
he
laid
this
cruel
-
seeming
spell
on
the
outdoor
world
,
for
he
meant
to
light
up
home
with
new
brightness
,
to
deepen
all
the
richness
of
indoor
color
,
and
give
a
keener
edge
of
delight
to
the
warm
fragrance
of
food
;
he
meant
to
prepare
a
sweet
imprisonment
that
would
strengthen
the
primitive
fellowship
of
kindred
,
and
make
the
sunshine
of
familiar
human
faces
as
welcome
as
the
hidden
day
-
star
.
<EOS>
His
kindness
fell
but
hardly
on
the
homeless
,
 
fell
but
hardly
on
the
homes
where
the
hearth
was
not
very
warm
,
and
where
the
food
had
little
fragrance
;
where
the
human
faces
had
had
no
sunshine
in
them
,
but
rather
the
leaden
,
blank
-
eyed
gaze
of
unexpectant
want
.
<EOS>
But
the
fine
old
season
meant
well
;
and
if
he
has
not
learned
the
secret
how
to
bless
men
impartially
,
it
is
because
his
father
Time
,
with
ever
-
unrelenting
unrelenting
purpose
,
still
hides
that
secret
in
his
own
mighty
,
slow
-
beating
heart
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
this
Christmas
day
,
in
spite
of
Tom
's
fresh
delight
in
home
,
was
not
,
he
thought
,
somehow
or
other
,
quite
so
happy
as
it
had
always
been
before
.
<EOS>
The
red
berries
were
just
as
abundant
on
the
holly
,
and
he
and
Maggie
had
dressed
all
the
windows
and
mantlepieces
and
picture
-
frames
on
Christmas
eve
with
as
much
taste
as
ever
,
wedding
the
thick
-
set
scarlet
clusters
with
branches
of
the
black
-
berried
ivy
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
singing
under
the
windows
after
midnight
,
 
supernatural
singing
,
Maggie
always
felt
,
in
spite
of
Tom
's
contemptuous
insistence
that
the
singers
were
old
Patch
,
the
parish
clerk
,
and
the
rest
of
the
church
choir
;
she
trembled
with
awe
when
their
carolling
broke
in
upon
her
dreams
,
and
the
image
of
men
in
fustian
clothes
was
always
thrust
away
by
the
vision
of
angels
resting
on
the
parted
cloud
.
<EOS>
The
midnight
chant
had
helped
as
usual
to
lift
the
morning
above
the
level
of
common
days
;
and
then
there
were
the
smell
of
hot
toast
and
ale
from
the
kitchen
,
at
the
breakfast
hour
;
the
favorite
anthem
,
the
green
boughs
,
and
the
short
sermon
gave
the
appropriate
festal
character
to
the
church
-
going
;
and
aunt
and
uncle
Moss
,
with
all
their
seven
children
,
were
looking
like
so
many
reflectors
of
the
bright
parlor
-
fire
,
when
the
church
-
goers
came
back
,
stamping
the
snow
from
their
feet
.
<EOS>
The
plum
-
pudding
was
of
the
same
handsome
roundness
as
ever
,
and
came
in
with
the
symbolic
blue
flames
around
it
,
as
if
it
had
been
heroically
snatched
from
the
nether
fires
,
into
which
it
had
been
thrown
by
dyspeptic
Puritans
;
the
dessert
was
as
splendid
as
ever
,
with
its
golden
oranges
,
brown
nuts
,
and
the
crystalline
light
and
dark
of
apple
-
jelly
and
damson
cheese
;
in
all
these
things
Christmas
was
as
it
had
always
been
since
Tom
could
remember
;
it
was
only
distinguished
,
if
by
anything
,
by
superior
sliding
and
snowballs
.
  
<EOS>
Christmas
was
cheery
,
but
not
so
Mr.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
He
was
irate
and
defiant
;
and
Tom
,
though
he
espoused
his
father
's
quarrels
and
shared
his
father
's
sense
of
injury
,
was
not
without
some
of
the
feeling
that
oppressed
Maggie
when
Mr.
Tulliver
got
louder
and
more
angry
in
narration
and
assertion
with
the
increased
leisure
of
dessert
.
<EOS>
The
attention
that
Tom
might
have
concentrated
on
his
nuts
and
wine
was
distracted
by
a
sense
that
there
were
rascally
enemies
in
the
world
,
and
that
the
business
of
grown
-
up
life
could
hardly
be
conducted
without
a
good
deal
of
quarrelling
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Tom
was
not
fond
of
quarrelling
,
unless
it
could
soon
be
put
an
end
to
by
a
fair
stand
-
up
fight
with
an
adversary
whom
he
had
every
chance
of
thrashing
;
and
his
father
's
irritable
talk
made
him
uncomfortable
,
though
he
never
accounted
to
himself
for
the
feeling
,
or
conceived
the
notion
that
his
father
was
faulty
in
this
respect
.
  
<EOS>
The
particular
embodiment
of
the
evil
principle
now
exciting
Mr.
Tulliver
's
determined
resistance
was
Mr.
Pivart
,
who
,
having
lands
higher
up
the
Ripple
,
was
taking
measures
for
their
irrigation
,
which
either
were
,
or
would
be
,
or
were
bound
to
be
(
on
the
principle
that
water
was
water
)
,
an
infringement
on
Mr.
Tulliver
's
legitimate
share
of
water
-
power
.
<EOS>
Dix
,
who
had
a
mill
on
the
stream
,
was
a
feeble
auxiliary
of
Old
Harry
compared
with
Pivart
.
<EOS>
Dix
had
been
brought
to
his
senses
by
arbitration
,
and
Wakem
's
advice
had
not
carried
_
him
_
far
.
<EOS>
No
;
Dix
,
Mr.
Tulliver
considered
,
had
been
as
good
as
nowhere
in
point
of
law
;
and
in
the
intensity
of
his
indignation
against
Pivart
,
his
contempt
for
a
baffled
adversary
like
Dix
began
to
wear
the
air
of
a
friendly
attachment
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
male
audience
to
-
day
except
Mr.
Moss
,
who
knew
nothing
,
as
he
said
,
of
the
"
natur
"
o
'
mills
,
"
and
could
only
assent
to
Mr.
Tulliver
's
arguments
on
the
_
<EOS>
a
priori
_
ground
of
family
relationship
and
monetary
obligation
;
but
Mr.
Tulliver
did
not
talk
with
the
futile
intention
of
convincing
his
audience
<EOS>
,
he
talked
to
relieve
himself
;
while
good
Mr.
Moss
made
strong
efforts
to
keep
his
eyes
wide
open
,
in
spite
of
the
sleepiness
which
an
unusually
good
dinner
produced
in
his
hard
-
worked
frame
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Moss
,
more
alive
to
the
subject
,
and
interested
in
everything
that
affected
her
brother
,
listened
and
put
in
a
word
as
often
as
maternal
preoccupations
allowed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Pivart
's
a
new
name
hereabout
,
brother
,
is
n't
it
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
;
"
he
did
n't
own
the
land
in
father
's
time
,
nor
yours
either
,
before
I
was
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
New
name
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
should
think
it
_
is
_
a
new
name
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
with
angry
emphasis
.
"
<EOS>
Dorlcote
Mill
's
been
in
our
family
a
hundred
year
and
better
,
and
nobody
ever
heard
of
a
Pivart
meddling
with
the
river
,
till
this
fellow
came
and
bought
Bincome
's
farm
out
of
hand
,
before
anybody
else
could
so
much
as
say
"
snap
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
'll
<EOS>
_
Pivart
<EOS>
_
him
!
"
added
Mr.
Tulliver
,
lifting
his
glass
with
a
sense
that
he
had
defined
his
resolution
in
an
unmistakable
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
be
forced
to
go
to
law
with
him
,
I
hope
,
brother
?
"
said
Mrs.
Moss
,
with
some
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
I
shall
be
forced
to
;
but
I
know
what
I
shall
force
_
him
_
to
,
with
his
dikes
and
erigations
,
if
there
's
any
law
to
be
brought
to
bear
o
'
the
right
side
.
<EOS>
I
know
well
enough
who
's
at
the
bottom
of
it
;
he
's
got
Wakem
to
back
him
and
egg
him
on
.
<EOS>
I
know
Wakem
tells
him
the
law
ca
n't
touch
him
for
it
,
but
there
's
folks
can
handle
the
law
besides
Wakem
.
<EOS>
It
takes
a
big
raskil
to
beat
him
;
but
there
's
bigger
to
be
found
,
as
know
more
o
'
th
'
ins
and
outs
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
'
the
law
,
<EOS>
else
how
came
Wakem
to
lose
Brumley
's
suit
for
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
was
a
strictly
honest
man
,
and
proud
of
being
honest
,
but
he
considered
that
in
law
the
ends
of
justice
could
only
be
achieved
by
employing
a
stronger
knave
to
frustrate
a
weaker
.
<EOS>
Law
was
a
sort
of
cock
-
fight
,
in
which
it
was
the
business
of
injured
honesty
to
get
a
game
bird
with
the
best
pluck
and
the
strongest
spurs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gore
's
no
fool
;
you
need
n't
tell
me
that
,
"
he
observed
presently
,
in
a
pugnacious
tone
,
as
if
poor
Gritty
had
been
urging
that
lawyer
's
capabilities
;
"
but
,
you
see
,
he
is
n't
up
to
the
law
as
Wakem
is
.
<EOS>
And
water
's
a
very
particular
thing
;
you
ca
n't
pick
it
up
with
a
pitchfork
.
<EOS>
That
's
why
it
's
been
nuts
to
Old
Harry
and
the
lawyers
.
<EOS>
It
's
plain
enough
<EOS>
what
's
the
rights
and
the
wrongs
of
water
,
if
you
look
at
it
straight
-
forrard
;
for
a
river
's
a
river
,
and
if
you
've
got
a
mill
,
you
must
have
water
to
turn
it
;
and
it
's
no
use
telling
me
Pivart
's
erigation
and
nonsense
wo
n't
stop
my
wheel
;
I
know
what
belongs
to
water
better
than
that
.
<EOS>
Talk
to
me
<EOS>
o
'
what
th
'
engineers
say
!
<EOS>
I
say
it
's
common
sense
,
as
Pivart
's
dikes
must
do
me
an
injury
.
<EOS>
But
if
that
's
their
engineering
,
I
'll
put
Tom
to
it
by
-
and
-
by
,
and
he
shall
see
if
he
ca
n't
find
a
bit
more
sense
in
th
'
engineering
business
than
what
_
that
_
comes
to
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
,
looking
round
with
some
anxiety
at
this
announcement
of
his
prospects
,
unthinkingly
withdrew
a
small
rattle
he
was
amusing
baby
Moss
with
,
<EOS>
whereupon
she
,
being
a
baby
that
knew
her
own
mind
with
remarkable
clearness
,
instantaneously
expressed
her
sentiments
in
a
piercing
yell
,
and
was
not
to
be
appeased
even
by
the
restoration
of
the
rattle
,
feeling
apparently
that
the
original
wrong
of
having
it
taken
from
her
remained
in
all
its
force
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Moss
hurried
away
with
her
into
another
room
,
and
expressed
to
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
who
accompanied
her
,
the
conviction
that
the
dear
child
had
good
reasons
for
crying
;
implying
that
if
it
was
supposed
to
be
the
rattle
that
baby
clamored
for
,
she
was
a
misunderstood
baby
.
<EOS>
The
thoroughly
justifiable
yell
being
quieted
,
Mrs.
Moss
looked
at
her
sister
-
in
-
law
and
said
,
    
"
I
'm
sorry
to
see
brother
so
put
out
about
this
water
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
your
brother
's
way
,
Mrs.
Moss
;
I
'd
never
anything
o
'
<EOS>
that
sort
before
I
was
married
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
with
a
half
-
implied
reproach
.
<EOS>
She
always
spoke
of
her
husband
as
"
your
brother
"
to
Mrs.
Moss
in
any
case
when
his
line
of
conduct
was
not
matter
of
pure
admiration
.
<EOS>
Amiable
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
who
was
never
angry
in
her
life
,
had
yet
her
mild
share
of
that
spirit
without
which
she
could
hardly
have
been
at
once
a
Dodson
and
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Being
always
on
the
defensive
toward
her
own
sisters
,
it
was
natural
that
she
should
be
keenly
conscious
of
her
superiority
,
even
as
the
weakest
Dodson
,
over
a
husband
's
sister
,
who
,
besides
being
poorly
off
,
and
inclined
to
"
hang
on
"
her
brother
,
had
the
good
-
natured
submissiveness
of
a
large
,
easy
-
tempered
,
untidy
,
prolific
woman
,
with
affection
enough
in
her
not
only
for
her
own
husband
and
abundant
children
,
but
for
any
number
of
collateral
relations
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
and
pray
he
wo
n't
go
to
law
,
"
said
Mrs.
Moss
,
"
<EOS>
for
there
's
never
any
knowing
where
that
'll
end
.
<EOS>
And
the
right
does
n't
allays
win
.
<EOS>
This
Mr.
Pivart
's
a
rich
man
,
by
what
I
can
make
out
,
and
the
rich
mostly
get
things
their
own
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
As
to
that
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
stroking
her
dress
down
,
<EOS>
"
I
've
seen
what
riches
are
in
my
own
family
;
for
my
sisters
have
got
husbands
as
can
afford
to
do
pretty
much
what
they
like
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
sometimes
I
shall
be
drove
off
my
head
with
the
talk
about
this
law
and
erigation
;
and
my
sisters
lay
all
the
fault
to
me
,
for
they
do
n't
know
what
it
is
to
marry
a
man
like
your
brother
;
how
should
they
?
<EOS>
Sister
Pullet
has
her
own
way
from
morning
till
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mrs.
Moss
,
"
I
do
n't
think
I
should
like
my
husband
if
he
had
n't
got
any
wits
of
his
own
,
and
I
had
to
find
head
-
piece
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
deal
easier
to
do
what
pleases
one
's
husband
,
than
to
be
puzzling
what
else
one
should
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
people
come
to
talk
o
'
doing
what
pleases
their
husbands
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
with
a
faint
imitation
of
her
sister
Glegg
,
"
I
'm
sure
your
brother
might
have
waited
a
long
while
before
he
'd
have
found
a

him
have
his
say
in
everything
,
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
It
's
nothing
but
law
and
erigation
now
,
from
when
we
first
get
up
in
the
morning
till
we
go
to
bed
at
night
;
and
I
never
contradict
him
;
I
only
say
,
"
Well
,
Mr.
Tulliver
,
do
as
you
like
;
but
whativer
you
do
,
do
n't
go
to
law
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
as
we
have
seen
,
was
not
without
influence
over
her
husband
.
<EOS>
No
woman
is
;
she
can
always
incline
him
to
do
either
what
she
wishes
,
or
the
reverse
;
and
on
the
composite
impulses
that
were
threatening
to
hurry
Mr.
Tulliver
into
"
law
,
"
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
monotonous
pleading
had
doubtless
its
share
of
force
;
it
might
even
be
comparable
to
that
proverbial
feather
which
has
the
credit
or
discredit
of
breaking
the
camel
's
back
;
though
,
on
a
strictly
impartial
view
,
the
blame
ought
rather
to
lie
with
the
previous
weight
of
feathers
which
had
already
placed
the
back
in
such
imminent
peril
that
an
otherwise
innocent
feather
could
not
settle
on
it
without
mischief
.
<EOS>
Not
that
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
feeble
beseeching
could
have
had
this
feather
's
weight
in
virtue
of
her
single
personality
;
but
whenever
she
departed
from
entire
assent
to
her
husband
,
he
saw
in
her
the
representative
of
the
Dodson
family
;
and
it
was
a
guiding
principle
with
Mr.
Tulliver
to
let
the
Dodsons
know
that
they
were
not
to
domineer
over
_
him
_
,
or
 
more
specifically
 
that
a
male
Tulliver
was
far
more
than
equal
to
four
female
Dodsons
,
even
though
one
of
them
was
Mrs.
Glegg
.
  
<EOS>
But
not
even
a
direct
argument
from
that
typical
Dodson
female
herself
against
his
going
to
law
could
have
heightened
his
disposition
toward
it
so
much
as
the
mere
thought
of
Wakem
,
continually
freshened
by
the
sight
of
the
too
able
attorney
on
market
-
days
.
<EOS>
Wakem
,
to
his
certain
knowledge
,
was
(
metaphorically
speaking
)
at
the
bottom
of
Pivart
's
irrigation
;
Wakem
had
tried
to
make
Dix
stand
out
,
and
go
to
law
about
the
dam
;
it
was
unquestionably
Wakem
who
had
caused
Mr.
Tulliver
to
lose
the
suit
about
the
right
of
road
and
the
bridge
that
made
a
thoroughfare
of
his
land
for
every
vagabond
who
preferred
an
opportunity
of
damaging
private
property
to
walking
like
an
honest
man
along
the
highroad
;
all
lawyers
were
more
or
less
rascals
,
but
Wakem
's
rascality
was
of
that
peculiarly
aggravated
kind
which
placed
itself
in
opposition
to
that
form
of
right
embodied
in
Mr.
Tulliver
's
interests
and
opinions
.
<EOS>
And
as
an
extra
touch
of
bitterness
,
the
injured
miller
had
recently
,
in
borrowing
the
five
hundred
pounds
,
been
obliged
to
carry
a
little
business
to
Wakem
's
office
on
his
own
account
.
<EOS>
A
hook
-
nosed
glib
fellow
!
<EOS>
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
,
 
always
looking
so
sure
of
his
game
!
<EOS>
And
it
was
vexatious
that
Lawyer
Gore
was
not
more
like
him
,
but
was
a
bald
,
round
-
featured
man
,
with
bland
manners
and
fat
hands
;
a
game
-
cock
that
you
would
be
rash
to
bet
upon
against
Wakem
.
<EOS>
Gore
was
a
sly
fellow
.
<EOS>
His
weakness
did
not
lie
on
the
side
of
scrupulosity
;
but
the
largest
amount
of
winking
,
however
significant
,
is
not
equivalent
to
seeing
through
a
stone
wall
;
and
confident
as
Mr.
Tulliver
was
in
his
principle
that
water
was
water
,
and
in
the
direct
inference
that
Pivart
had
not
a
leg
to
stand
on
in
this
affair
of
irrigation
,
he
had
an
uncomfortable
suspicion
that
Wakem
had
more
law
to
show
against
this
(
rationally
)
irrefragable
inference
than
Gore
could
show
for
it
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
if
they
went
to
law
,
there
was
a
chance
for
Mr.
Tulliver
to
employ
Counsellor
Wylde
on
his
side
,
instead
of
having
that
admirable
bully
against
him
;
and
the
prospect
of
seeing
a
witness
of
Wakem
's
made
to
perspire
and
become
confounded
,
as
Mr.
Tulliver
's
witness
had
once
been
,
was
alluring
to
the
love
of
retributive
justice
.
  
<EOS>
Much
rumination
had
Mr.
Tulliver
on
these
puzzling
subjects
during
his
rides
on
the
gray
horse
;
much
turning
of
the
head
from
side
to
side
,
as
the
scales
dipped
alternately
;
but
the
probable
result
was
still
out
of
sight
,
only
to
be
reached
through
much
hot
argument
and
iteration
in
domestic
and
social
life
.
<EOS>
That
initial
stage
of
the
dispute
which
consisted
in
the
narration
of
the
case
and
the
enforcement
of
Mr.
Tulliver
's
views
concerning
it
throughout
the
entire
circle
of
his
connections
would
necessarily
take
time
;
and
at
the
beginning
of
February
,
when
Tom
was
going
to
school
again
,
there
were
scarcely
any
new
items
to
be
detected
in
his
father
's
statement
of
the
case
against
Pivart
,
or
any
more
specific
indication
of
the
measures
he
was
bent
on
taking
against
that
rash
contravener
of
the
principle
that
water
was
water
.
<EOS>
Iteration
,
like
friction
,
is
likely
to
generate
heat
instead
of
progress
,
and
Mr.
Tulliver
's
heat
was
certainly
more
and
more
palpable
.
<EOS>
If
there
had
been
no
new
evidence
on
any
other
point
,
there
had
been
new
evidence
that
Pivart
was
as
"
thick
as
mud
"
with
Wakem
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
,
"
said
Tom
,
one
evening
near
the
end
of
the
holidays
,
"
uncle
Glegg
says
Lawyer
Wakem
_
is
_
going
to
send
his
son
to
Mr.
Stelling
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
true
,
what
they
said
about
his
going
to
be
sent
to
France
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
like
me
to
go
to
school
with
Wakem
's
son
,
shall
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
matter
for
that
,
my
boy
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
;
"
do
n't
you
learn
anything
bad
of
him
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
The
lad
's
a
poor
deformed
creatur
,
and
takes
after
his
mother
in
the
face
;
I
think
there
is
n't
much
of
his
father
in
him
.
<EOS>
It
's
<EOS>
a
sign
Wakem
thinks
high
o
'
<EOS>
Mr.
Sterling
,
as
he
sends
his
son
to
him
,
and
Wakem
knows
meal
from
bran
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
in
his
heart
was
rather
proud
of
the
fact
that
his
son
was
to
have
the
same
advantages
as
Wakem
's
;
but
Tom
was
not
at
all
easy
on
the
point
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
much
clearer
if
the
lawyer
's
son
had
not
been
deformed
,
for
then
Tom
would
have
had
the
prospect
of
pitching
into
him
with
all
that
freedom
which
is
derived
from
a
high
moral
sanction
.
    
<EOS>
The
New
Schoolfellow
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
cold
,
wet
January
day
on
which
Tom
went
back
to
school
;
a
day
quite
in
keeping
with
this
severe
phase
of
his
destiny
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
not
carried
in
his
pocket
a
parcel
of
sugar
-
candy
and
a
small
Dutch
doll
for
little
Laura
,
there
would
have
been
no
ray
of
expected
pleasure
to
enliven
the
general
gloom
.
<EOS>
But
he
liked
to
think
how
Laura
would
put
out
her
lips
and
her
tiny
hands
for
the
bits
of
sugarcandy
;
and
to
give
the
greater
keenness
to
these
pleasures
of
imagination
,
he
took
out
the
parcel
,
made
a
small
hole
in
the
paper
,
and
bit
off
a
crystal
or
two
,
which
had
so
solacing
an
effect
under
the
confined
prospect
and
damp
odors
of
the
gig
-
umbrella
,
that
he
repeated
the
process
more
than
once
on
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Tulliver
,
we
're
glad
to
see
you
again
,
"
said
Mr.
Stelling
,
heartily
.
<EOS>
"
Take
off
your
wrappings
and
come
into
the
study
till
dinner
.
<EOS>
You
'll
find
a
bright
fire
there
,
and
a
new
companion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
felt
in
an
uncomfortable
flutter
as
he
took
off
his
woollen
comforter
and
other
wrappings
.
<EOS>
He
had
seen
Philip
Wakem
at
St.
Ogg
's
,
but
had
always
turned
his
eyes
away
from
him
as
quickly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
disliked
having
a
deformed
boy
for
his
companion
,
even
if
Philip
had
not
been
the
son
of
a
bad
man
.
<EOS>
And
Tom
did
not
see
how
a
bad
man
's
son
could
be
very
good
.
<EOS>
His
own
father
was
a
good
man
,
and
he
would
readily
have
fought
any
one
who
said
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
a
state
of
mingled
embarrassment
and
defiance
as
he
followed
Mr.
Stelling
to
the
study
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
is
a
new
companion
for
you
to
shake
hands
with
,
Tulliver
,
"
said
that
gentleman
on
entering
the
study
,
 
"
Master
Philip
Wakem
.
<EOS>
I
shall
leave
you
to
make
acquaintance
by
yourselves
.
<EOS>
You
already
know
something
of
each
other
,
I
imagine
;
for
you
are
neighbors
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
looked
confused
and
awkward
,
while
Philip
rose
and
glanced
at
him
timidly
.
<EOS>
Tom
did
not
like
to
go
up
and
put
out
his
hand
,
and
he
was
not
prepared
to
say
,
"
How
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
on
so
short
a
notice
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
wisely
turned
away
,
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
;
boys
'
shyness
only
wears
off
in
the
absence
of
their
elders
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
was
at
once
too
proud
and
too
timid
to
walk
toward
Tom
.
<EOS>
He
thought
,
or
rather
felt
,
that
Tom
had
an
aversion
to
looking
at
him
;
every
one
,
almost
,
disliked
looking
at
him
;
and
his
deformity
was
more
conspicuous
when
he
walked
.
<EOS>
So
they
remained
without
shaking
hands
or
even
speaking
,
while
Tom
went
to
the
fire
and
warmed
himself
,
every
now
and
then
casting
furtive
glances
at
Philip
,
who
seemed
to
be
drawing
absently
first
one
object
<EOS>
and
then
another
on
a
piece
of
paper
he
had
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
seated
himself
again
,
and
as
he
drew
,
was
thinking
what
he
could
say
to
Tom
,
and
trying
to
overcome
his
own
repugnance
to
making
the
first
advances
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
began
to
look
oftener
and
longer
at
Philip
's
face
,
for
he
could
see
it
without
noticing
the
hump
,
and
it
was
really
not
a
disagreeable
face
,
 
very
old
-
looking
,
Tom
thought
.
<EOS>
He
wondered
how
much
older
Philip
was
than
himself
.
<EOS>
An
anatomist
 
even
a
mere
physiognomist
  
would
have
seen
that
the
deformity
of
Philip
's
spine
was
not
a
congenital
hump
,
but
the
result
of
an
accident
in
infancy
;
but
you
do
not
expect
from
Tom
any
acquaintance
with
such
distinctions
;
to
him
,
Philip
was
simply
a
humpback
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
vague
notion
that
the
deformity
of
Wakem
's
son
had
some
relation
to
the
lawyer
's
rascality
,
of
which
he
had
so
often
heard
his
father
talk
with
hot
emphasis
;
and
he
felt
,
too
,
a
half
-
admitted
fear
of
him
as
probably
a
spiteful
fellow
,
who
,
not
being
able
to
fight
you
,
had
cunning
ways
of
doing
you
a
mischief
by
the
sly
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
humpbacked
tailor
in
the
neighborhood
of
Mr.
Jacobs
's
academy
,
who
was
considered
a
very
unamiable
character
,
and
was
much
hooted
after
by
public
-
spirited
boys
solely
on
the
ground
of
his
unsatisfactory
moral
qualities
;
so
that
Tom
was
not
without
a
basis
of
fact
to
go
upon
.
<EOS>
Still
,
no
face
could
be
more
unlike
that
ugly
tailor
's
than
this
melancholy
boy
's
face
,
 
<EOS>
the
brown
hair
round
it
waved
and
curled
at
the
ends
like
a
girl
's
<EOS>
;
Tom
thought
that
truly
pitiable
.
<EOS>
This
Wakem
was
a
pale
,
puny
fellow
,
and
it
was
quite
clear
he
would
not
be
able
to
play
at
anything
worth
speaking
of
;
but
he
handled
his
pencil
in
an
enviable
manner
,
and
was
apparently
making
one
thing
after
another
without
any
trouble
.
<EOS>
What
was
he
drawing
?
<EOS>
Tom
was
quite
warm
now
,
and
wanted
something
new
to
be
going
forward
.
<EOS>
It
was
certainly
more
agreeable
to
have
an
ill
-
natured
humpback
as
a
companion
than
to
stand
looking
out
of
the
study
window
at
the
rain
,
and
kicking
his
foot
against
the
washboard
in
solitude
;
something
would
happen
every
day
,
  
"
a
quarrel
or
something
"
;
and
Tom
thought
he
should
rather
like
to
show
Philip
that
he
had
better
not
try
his
spiteful
tricks
on
_
him
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
He
suddenly
walked
across
the
hearth
and
looked
over
Philip
's
paper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
that
's
a
donkey
with
panniers
,
and
a
spaniel
,
and
partridges
in
the
corn
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
his
tongue
being
completely
loosed
by
surprise
and
admiration
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
my
buttons
!
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
draw
like
that
.
<EOS>
I
'm
to
learn
drawing
this
half
;
I
wonder
if
I
shall
learn
to
make
dogs
and
donkeys
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
can
do
them
without
learning
,
"
said
Philip
;
"
I
never
learned
drawing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
learned
?
"
said
Tom
,
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
when
I
make
dogs
and
horses
,
and
those
things
,
the
heads
and
the
legs
wo
n't
come
right
;
though
I
can
see
how
they
ought
to
be
very
well
.
<EOS>
I
can
make
houses
,
and
all
sorts
of
chimneys
,
 
chimneys
going
all
down
the
wall
,
 
and
windows
in
the
roof
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
But
I
dare
say
I
could
do
dogs
and
horses
if
I
was
to
try
more
,
"
he
added
,
reflecting
that
Philip
might
falsely
suppose
that
he
was
going
to
"
knock
under
,
"
if
he
were
too
frank
about
the
imperfection
of
his
accomplishments
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
said
Philip
,
"
it
's
very
easy
.
<EOS>
You
've
only
to
look
well
at
things
,
and
draw
them
over
and
over
again
.
<EOS>
What
you
do
wrong
once
,
you
can
alter
the
next
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
have
n't
you
been
taught
_
any_thing
?
"
said
Tom
,
beginning
to
have
a
puzzled
suspicion
that
Philip
's
crooked
back
might
be
the
source
of
remarkable
faculties

<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
'd
been
to
school
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Philip
,
smiling
;
"
I
've
been
taught
Latin
and
Greek
and
mathematics
,
and
writing
and
such
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
I
say
,
you
do
n't
like
Latin
,
though
,
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
said
Tom
,
lowering
his
voice
confidentially
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
;
I
do
n't
care
much
about
it
,
"
said
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
but
perhaps
you
have
n't
got
into
the
_
Propria
quæ
maribus
_
,
"
said
Tom
,
nodding
his
head
sideways
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
that
was
the
test
;
it
was
easy
talking
till
you
came
to
_
that
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
felt
some
bitter
complacency
in
the
promising
stupidity
of
this
well
-
made
,
active
-
looking
boy
;
but
made
polite
by
his
own
extreme
sensitiveness
,
as
well
as
by
his
desire
to
conciliate
,
he
checked
his
inclination
to
laugh
,
and
said
quietly
,
    
"
I
've
done
with
the
grammar
;
I
do
n't
learn
that
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
wo
n't
have
the
same
lessons
as
I
shall
?
"
<EOS>
said
Tom
,
with
a
sense
of
disappointment
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
<EOS>
;
but
I
dare
say
I
can
help
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
help
you
if
I
can
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
did
not
say
"
Thank
you
,
"
for
he
was
quite
absorbed
in
the
thought
that
Wakem
's
son
did
not
seem
so
spiteful
a
fellow
as
might
have
been
expected
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
he
said
presently
,
"
do
you
love
your
father
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Philip
,
coloring
deeply
;
"
do
n't
you
love
yours
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
 
I
only
wanted
to
know
,
"
said
Tom
,
rather
ashamed
of
himself
,
now
he
saw
Philip
coloring
and
looking
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
He
found
much
difficulty
in
adjusting
his
attitude
of
mind
toward
the
son
of
Lawyer
Wakem
,
and
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
if
Philip
disliked
his
father
,
that
fact
might
go
some
way
toward
clearing
up
his
perplexity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
learn
drawing
now
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
by
way
of
changing
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
wishes
me
to
give
all
my
time
to
other
things
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
Latin
and
Euclid
,
and
those
things
?
<EOS>
"
said
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Philip
,
who
had
left
off
using
his
pencil
,
and
was
resting
his
head
on
one
hand
,
while
Tom
was
learning
forward
on
both
elbows
,
and
looking
with
increasing
admiration
at
the
dog
and
the
donkey
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
do
n't
mind
that
?
"
said
Tom
,
with
strong
curiosity
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
like
to
know
what
everybody
else
knows
.
<EOS>
I
can
study
what
I
like
by
-
and
-
by
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
think
why
anybody
should
learn
Latin
,
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
part
of
the
education
of
a
gentleman
,
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
All
gentlemen
learn
the
same
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
do
you
think
Sir
John
Crake
,
the
master
of
the
harriers
,
knows
Latin
?
"
said
Tom
,
who
had
often
thought
he
should
like
to
resemble
Sir
John
Crake
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
learned
it
when
he
was
a
boy
,
of
course
,
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
dare
say
he
's
forgotten
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
well
,
I
can
do
that
,
then
,
"
said
Tom
,
not
with
any
epigrammatic
intention
,
but
with
serious
satisfaction
at
the
idea
that
,
as
far
as
Latin
was
concerned
,
there
was
no
hindrance
to
his
resembling
Sir
John
Crake
.
<EOS>
"
Only
you
're
obliged
to
remember
it
while
you
're
at
school
,
else
you
've
got
to
learn
ever
so
many
lines
of

<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
's
very
particular
 
<EOS>
did
you
know
?
<EOS>
He
'll
have
you
up
ten
times

you

he
wo
n't
let
you
go
a

I

can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
mind
,
"
said
Philip
,
unable
to
choke
a
laugh
;
"
I
can
remember
things
easily
.
<EOS>
And
there
are
some
lessons
<EOS>
I
'm
very
fond
of

<EOS>
I
'm
very
fond
of
Greek
history
,
and
everything
about
the
Greeks
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
have
been
a
Greek
and
fought
the
Persians
,
and
then
have
come
home
and
have
written
tragedies
,
or
else
have
been
listened
to
by
everybody
for
my
wisdom
,
like
Socrates
,
and
have
died
a
grand
death
.
"
<EOS>
(
Philip
,
you
perceive
,
was
not
without
a
wish
to
impress
the
well
-
made
barbarian
with
a
sense
of
his
mental
superiority
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
were
the
Greeks
great
fighters
?
"
said
Tom
,
who
saw
a
vista
in
this
direction
.
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anything
like
David
and
Goliath
and
Samson
in
the
Greek
history
?
<EOS>
Those
are
the
only
bits
I
like
in
the
history
of
the
Jews
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
there
are
very
fine
stories
of
that
sort
about
the
Greeks
,
 
about
the
heroes
of
early
times
who
killed
the
wild
beasts
,
as
Samson
did
.
<EOS>
And
in
the
Odyssey
 
<EOS>
that
's
a
beautiful
poem
 
<EOS>
there
's
a
more
wonderful
giant
than
Goliath
,
 
Polypheme
,
who
had
only
one
eye
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
;
and
Ulysses
,
a
little
fellow
,
but
very
wise
and
cunning
,
got
a
red
-
hot
pine
-
tree
and
stuck
it
into
this
one
eye
,
and
made
him
roar
like
a
thousand
bulls
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
fun
!
<EOS>
"
said
Tom
,
jumping
away
from
the
table
,
and
stamping
first
with
one
leg
and
then
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
can
you
tell
me
all
about
those
stories
?
<EOS>
Because
I
sha'n"t
learn
Greek
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
pausing
in
his
stamping
with
a
sudden
alarm
,
lest
the
contrary
might
be
possible
.
"
<EOS>
Does
every
gentleman
learn
Greek
?
<EOS>
Will
Mr.
Stelling
make
me
begin
with
it
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
should
think
not
,
very
likely
not
,
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
may
read
those
stories
without
knowing
Greek
.
<EOS>
I
've
got
them
in
English
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
I
do
n't
like
reading
;
I
'd
sooner
have
you
tell
them
me
.
<EOS>
But
only
the
fighting
ones
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
My
sister
Maggie
is
always
wanting
to
tell
me
stories
,
but
they
're
stupid
things
.
<EOS>
Girls
'
stories
always
are
.
<EOS>
Can
you
tell
a
good
many
fighting
stories
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
"
said
Philip
;
"
lots
of
them
,
besides
the
Greek
stories
.
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
about
Richard
Cœur
-
de
-
Lion
and
Saladin
,
and
about
William
Wallace
and
Robert
Bruce
and
James
Douglas
,
 
I
know
no
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
older
than
I
am
,
are
n't
you
?
"
said
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
old
are
_
you
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
'm
fifteen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
only
going
in
fourteen
,
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
thrashed
all
the
fellows
at
Jacob
's
 
<EOS>
that
's
where
I
was
before
I
came
here
.
<EOS>
And
I
beat
'em
all
at
bandy
and
climbing
.
<EOS>
And
I
wish
Mr.
Stelling
would
let
us
go
fishing
.
<EOS>
_
I
_
could
show
you
how
to
fish
.
<EOS>
You
_
<EOS>
could
_
fish
,
could
n't
you
?
<EOS>
It
's
only
standing
,
and
sitting
still
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
,
in
his
turn
,
wished
to
make
the
balance
dip
in
his
favor
.
<EOS>
This
hunchback
must
not
suppose
that
his
acquaintance
with
fighting
stories
put
him
on
a
par
with
an
actual
fighting
hero
,
like
Tom
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
Philip
winced
under
this
allusion
to
his
unfitness
for
active
sports
,
and
he
answered
almost
peevishly
,
    
"
I
ca
n't
bear
fishing
.
<EOS>
I
think
people
look
like
fools
sitting
watching
a
line
hour
after
hour
,
or
else
throwing
and
throwing
,
and
catching
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
but
you
would
n't
say
they
looked
like
fools
when
they
landed
a
big
pike
,
I
can
tell
you
,
"
said
Tom
,
who
had
never
caught
anything
that
was
"
big
"
in
his
life
,
but
whose
imagination
was
on
the
stretch
with
indignant
zeal
for
the
honor
of
sport
.
<EOS>
Wakem
's
son
,
it
was
plain
,
had
his
disagreeable
points
,
and
must
be
kept
in
due
check
.
<EOS>
Happily
for
the
harmony
of
this
first
interview
,
they
were
now
called
to
dinner
,
and
Philip
was
not
allowed
to
develop
farther
his
unsound
views
on
the
subject
of
fishing
.
<EOS>
But
Tom
said
to
himself
,
that
was
just
what
he
should
have
expected
from
a
hunchback
.
    
<EOS>
"
The
Young
Idea
"
  
<EOS>
The
alterations
of
feeling
in
that
first
dialogue
between
Tom
and
Philip
continued
to
make
their
intercourse
even
after
many
weeks
of
schoolboy
intimacy
.
<EOS>
Tom
never
quite
lost
the
feeling
that
Philip
,
being
the
son
of
a
"
rascal
,
"
was
his
natural
enemy
;
never
thoroughly
overcame
his
repulsion
to
Philip
's
deformity
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
boy
who
adhered
tenaciously
to
impressions
once
received
;
as
with
all
minds
in
which
mere
perception
predominates
over
thought
and
emotion
,
the
external
remained
to
him
rigidly
what
it
was
in
the
first
instance
.
<EOS>
But
then
it
was
impossible
not
to
like
Philip
's
company
when
he
was
in
a
good
humor
;
he
could
help
one
so
well
in
one
's
Latin
exercises
,
which
Tom
regarded
as
a
kind
of
puzzle
that
could
only
be
found
out
by
a
lucky
chance
;
and
he
could
tell
such
wonderful
fighting
stories
about
Hal
of
the
Wynd
,
for
example
,
and
other
heroes
who
were
especial
favorites
with
Tom
,
because
they
laid
about
them
with
heavy
strokes
.
<EOS>
He
had
small
opinion
of
Saladin
,
whose
cimeter
could
cut
a
cushion
in
two
in
an
instant
;
who
wanted
to
cut
cushions
?
<EOS>
That
was
a
stupid
story
,
and
he
did
n't
care
to
hear
it
again
.
<EOS>
But
when
Robert
Bruce
,
on
the
black
pony
,
rose
in
his
stirrups
,
and
lifting
his
good
battle
-
axe
,
cracked
at
once
the
helmet
and
the
skull
of
the
too
hasty
knight
at
Bannockburn
,
then
Tom
felt
all
the
exaltation
of
sympathy
,
and
if
he
had
had
a
cocoanut
at
hand
,
he
would
have
cracked
it
at
once
with
the
poker
.
<EOS>
Philip
in
his
happier
moods
indulged
Tom
to
the
top
of
his
bent
,
heightening
the
crash
and
bang
and
fury
of
every
fight
with
all
the
artillery
of
epithets
and
similes
at
his
command
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
always
in
a
good
humor
or
happy
mood
.
<EOS>
The
slight
spurt
of
peevish
susceptibility
which
had
escaped
him
in
their
first
interview
was
a
symptom
of
a
perpetually
recurring
mental
ailment
,
half
of
it
nervous
irritability
,
half
of
it
the
heart
-
bitterness
produced
by
the
sense
of
his
deformity
.
<EOS>
In
these
fits
of
susceptibility
every
glance
seemed
to
him
to
be
charged
either
with
offensive
pity
or
with
ill
-
repressed
disgust
;
at
the
very
least
it
was
an
indifferent
glance
,
and
Philip
felt
indifference
as
a
child
of
the
south
feels
the
chill
air
of
a
northern
spring
.
<EOS>
Poor
Tom
's
blundering
patronage
when
they
were
out
of
doors
together
would
sometimes
make
him
turn
upon
the
well
-
meaning
lad
quite
savagely
;
and
his
eyes
,
usually
sad
and
quiet
,
would
flash
with
anything
but
playful
lightning
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
Tom
retained
his
suspicions
of
the
humpback
.
  
<EOS>
But
Philip
's
self
-
taught
skill
in
drawing
was
another
link
between
them
;
for
Tom
found
,
to
his
disgust
,
that
his
new
drawing
-
master
gave
him
no
dogs
and
donkeys
to
draw
,
but
brooks
and
rustic
bridges
and
ruins
,
all
with
a
general
softness
of
black
-
lead
surface
,
indicating
that
nature
,
if
anything
,
was
rather
satiny
;
and
as
Tom
's
feeling
for
the
picturesque
in
landscape
was
at
present
quite
latent
,
it
is
not
surprising
that
Mr.
Goodrich
's
productions
seemed
to
him
an
uninteresting
form
of
art
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
,
having
a
vague
intention
that
Tom
should
be
put
to
some
business
which
included
the
drawing
out
of
plans
and
maps
,
had
complained
to
Mr.
Riley
,
when
he
saw
him
at
Mudport
,
that
Tom
seemed
to
be
learning
nothing
of
that
sort
<EOS>
;
whereupon
that
obliging
adviser
had
suggested
that
Tom
should
have
drawing
-
lessons
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
must
not
mind
paying
extra
for
drawing
;
let
Tom
be
made
a
good
draughtsman
,
and
he
would
be
able
to
turn
his
pencil
to
any
purpose
.
<EOS>
So
it
was
ordered
that
Tom
should
have
drawing
-
lessons
;
and
whom
should
Mr.
Stelling
have
selected
as
a
master
if
not
Mr.
Goodrich
,
who
was
considered
quite
at
the
head
of
his
profession
within
a
circuit
of
twelve
miles
round
King
's
Lorton
?
<EOS>
By
which
means
Tom
learned
to
make
an
extremely
fine
point
to
his
pencil
,
and
to
represent
landscape
with
a
"
broad
generality
,
"
which
,
doubtless
from
a
narrow
tendency
in
his
mind
to
details
,
he
thought
extremely
dull
.

All
this
,
you
remember
,
happened
in
those
dark
ages
when
there
were
no
schools
of
design
;
before
schoolmasters
were
invariably
men
of
scrupulous
integrity
,
and
before
the
clergy
were
all
men
of
enlarged
minds
and
varied
culture
.
<EOS>
In
those
less
favored
days
,
it
is
no
fable
that
there
were
other
clergymen
besides
Mr.
Stelling
who
had
narrow
intellects
and
large
wants
,
and
whose
income
,
by
a
logical
confusion
to
which
<EOS>
Fortune
,
being
a
female
as
well
as
blindfold
,
is
peculiarly
liable
,
was
proportioned
not
to
their
wants
but
to
their
intellect
,
with
which
income
has
clearly
no
inherent
relation
.
<EOS>
The
problem
these
gentlemen
had
to
solve
was
to
readjust
the
proportion
between
their
wants
and
their
income
;
and
since
wants
are
not
easily
starved
to
death
,
the
simpler
method
appeared
to
be
to
raise
their
income
.
<EOS>
There
was
but
one
way
of
doing
this
;
any
of
those
low
callings
in
which
men
are
obliged
to
do
good
work
at
a
low
price
were
forbidden
to
clergymen
;
was
it
their
fault
if
their
only
resource
was
to
turn
out
very
poor
work
at
a
high
price
?
<EOS>
Besides
,
how
should
Mr.
Stelling
be
expected
to
know
that
education
was
a
delicate
and
difficult
business
,
any
more
than
an
animal
endowed
with
a
power
of
boring
a
hole
through
a
rock
should
be
expected
to
have
wide
views
of
excavation
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
's
faculties
had
been
early
trained
to
boring
in
a
straight
line
,
and
he
had
no
faculty
to
spare
.
<EOS>
But
among
Tom
's
contemporaries
,
whose
fathers
cast
their
sons
on
clerical
instruction
to
find
them
ignorant
after
many
days
,
there
were
many
far
less
lucky
than
Tom
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
Education
was
almost
entirely
a
matter
of
luck
 
usually
of
ill
-
luck
 
in
those
distant
days
.
<EOS>
The
state
of
mind
in
which
you
take
a
billiard
-
cue
or
a
dice
-
box
in
your
hand
is
one
of
sober
certainty
compared
with
that
of
old
-
fashioned
fathers
,
like
Mr.
Tulliver
,
when
they
selected
a
school
or
a
tutor
for
their
sons
.
<EOS>
Excellent
men
,
who
had
been
forced
all
their
lives
to
spell
on
an
impromptu
-
phonetic
system
,
and
having
carried
on
a
successful
business
in
spite
of
this
disadvantage
,
had
acquired
money
enough
to
give
their
sons
a
better
start
in
life
than
they
had
had
themselves
,
must
necessarily
take
their
chance
as
to
the
conscience
and
the
competence
of
the
schoolmaster
whose
circular
fell
in
their
way
,
and
appeared
to
promise
so
much
more
than
they
would
ever
have
thought
of
asking
for
,
including
the
return
of
linen
,
fork
,
and
spoon
.
<EOS>
It
was
happy
for
them
if
some
ambitious
draper
of
their
acquaintance
had
not
brought
up
his
son
to
the
Church
,
and
if
that
young
gentleman
,
at
the
age
of
four
-
and
-
twenty
,
had
not
closed
his
college
dissipations
by
an
imprudent
marriage
;
otherwise
,
these
innocent
fathers
,
desirous
of
doing
the
best
for
their
offspring
,
could
only
escape
the
draper
's
son
by
happening
to
be
on
the
foundation
of
a
grammar
-
school
as
yet
unvisited
by
commissioners
,
where
two
or
three
boys
could
have
,
all
to
themselves
,
<EOS>
the
advantages
of
a
large
and
lofty
building
,
together
with
a
head
-
master
,
toothless
,
dim
-
eyed
and
deaf
,
whose
erudite
indistinctness
and
inattention
were
engrossed
by
them
at
the
rate
of
three
hundred
pounds
a
-
head
,
 
a
ripe
scholar
,
doubtless
,
when
first
appointed
;
but
all
ripeness
beneath
the
sun
has
a
further
stage
less
esteemed
in
the
market
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
Tulliver
,
then
,
compared
with
many
other
British
youths
of
his
time
who
have
since
had
to
scramble
through
life
with
some
fragments
of
more
or
less
relevant
knowledge
,
and
a
great
deal
of
strictly
relevant
ignorance
,
was
not
so
very
unlucky
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
was
a
broad
-
chested
,
healthy
man
,
with
the
bearing
of
a
gentleman
,
a
conviction
that
a
growing
boy
required
a
sufficiency
of
beef
,
and
a
certain
hearty
kindness
in
him
that
made
him
like
to
see
Tom
looking
well
and
enjoying
his
dinner
;
not
a
man
of
refined
conscience
,
or
with
any
deep
sense
of
the
infinite
issues
belonging
to
every
-
day
duties
,
not
quite
competent
to
his
high
offices
;
but
incompetent
gentlemen
must
live
,
and
without
private
fortune
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
they
could
all
live
genteelly
if
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
education
or
government
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
was
the
fault
of
Tom
's
mental
constitution
that
his
faculties
could
not
be
nourished
on
the
sort
of
knowledge
Mr.
Stelling
had
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
A
boy
born
with
a
deficient
power
of
apprehending
signs
and
abstractions
must
suffer
the
penalty
of
his
congenital
deficiency
,
just
as
if
he
had
been
born
with
one
leg
shorter
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
A
method
of
education
sanctioned
by
the
long
practice
of
our
venerable
ancestors
was
not
to
give
way
before
the
exceptional
dulness
of
a
boy
who
was
merely
living
at
the
time
then
present
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Stelling
was
convinced
that
a
boy
so
stupid
at
signs
and
abstractions
must
be
stupid
at
everything
else
,
even
if
that
reverend
gentleman
could
have
taught
him
everything
else
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
practice
of
our
venerable
ancestors
to
apply
that
ingenious
instrument
the
thumb
-
screw
,
and
to
tighten
and
tighten
it
in
order
to
elicit
non
-
existent
facts
;
they
had
a
fixed
opinion
to
begin
with
,
that
the
facts
were
existent
,
and
what
had
they
to
do
but
to
tighten
the
thumb
-
screw
?
<EOS>
In
like
manner
,
Mr.
Stelling
had
a
fixed
opinion
that
all
boys
with
any
capacity
could
learn
what
it
was
the
only
regular
thing
to
teach
;
if
they
were
slow
,
the
thumb
-
screw
must
be
tightened
,
 
the
exercises
must
be
insisted
on
with
increased
severity
,
and
a
page
of
Virgil
be
awarded
as
a
penalty
,
to
encourage
and
stimulate
a
too
languid
inclination
to
Latin
verse
.
  
<EOS>
The
thumb
-
screw
was
a
little
relaxed
,
however
,
during
this
second
half
-
year
.
<EOS>
Philip
was
so
advanced
in
his
studies
,
and
so
apt
,
that
Mr.
Stelling
could
obtain
credit
by
his
facility
,
which
required
little
help
,
much
more
easily
than
by
the
troublesome
process
of
overcoming
Tom
's
dulness
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
with
broad
chests
and
ambitious
intentions
do
sometimes
disappoint
their
friends
by
failing
to
carry
the
world
before
them
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
is
that
high
achievements
demand
some
other
unusual
qualification
besides
an
unusual
desire
for
high
prizes
;
perhaps
it
is
that
these
stalwart
gentlemen
are
rather
indolent
,
their
_
divinæ
particulum
auræ
_
being
obstructed
from
soaring
by
a
too
hearty
appetite
.
<EOS>
Some
reason
or
other
there
was
why
Mr.
Stelling
deferred
the
execution
of
many
spirited
projects
,
 
why
he
did
not
begin
the
editing
of
his
Greek
play
,
or
any
other
work
of
scholarship
,
in
his
leisure
hours
,
but
,
after
turning
the
key
of
his
private
study
with
much
resolution
,
sat
down
to
one
of
Theodore
Hook
's
novels
.
<EOS>
Tom
was
gradually
allowed
to
shuffle
through
his
lessons
with
less
rigor
,
and
having
Philip
to
help
him
,
he
was
able
to
make
some
show
of
having
applied
his
mind
in
a
confused
and
blundering
way
,
without
being
cross
-
examined
into
a
betrayal
that
his
mind
had
been
entirely
neutral
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
He
thought
school
much
more
bearable
under
this
modification
of
circumstances
;
and
he
went
on
contentedly
enough
,
picking
up
a
promiscuous
education
chiefly
from
things
that
were
not
intended
as
education
at
all
.
<EOS>
What
was
understood
to
be
his
education
was
simply
the
practice
of
reading
,
writing
,
and
spelling
,
carried
on
by
an
elaborate
appliance
of
unintelligible
ideas
,
and
by
much
failure
in
the
effort
to
learn
by
rote
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
there
was
a
visible
improvement
in
Tom
under
this
training
;
perhaps
because
he
was
not
a
boy
in
the
abstract
,
existing
solely
to
illustrate
the
evils
of
a
mistaken
education
,
but
a
boy
made
of
flesh
and
blood
,
with
dispositions
not
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
circumstances
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
improvement
in
his
bearing
,
for
example
;
and
some
credit
on
this
score
was
due
to
Mr.
Poulter
,
the
village
schoolmaster
,
who
,
being
an
old
Peninsular
soldier
,
was
employed
to
drill
Tom
,
 
a
source
of
high
mutual
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Poulter
,
who
was
understood
by
the
company
at
the
Black
Swan
to
have
once
struck
terror
into
the
hearts
of
the
French
,
was
no
longer
personally
formidable
.
<EOS>
He
had
rather
a
shrunken
appearance
,
and
was
tremulous
in
the
mornings
,
not
from
age
,
but
from
the
extreme
perversity
of
the
King
's
Lorton
boys
,
which
nothing
but
gin
could
enable
him
to
sustain
with
any
firmness
.
<EOS>
Still
,
he
carried
himself
with
martial
erectness
,
had
his
clothes
scrupulously
brushed
,
and
his
trousers
tightly
strapped
;
and
on
the
Wednesday
and
Saturday
afternoons
,
when
he
came
to
Tom
,
he
was
always
inspired
with
gin
and
old
memories
,
which
gave
him
an
exceptionally
spirited
air
,
as
of
a
superannuated
charger
who
hears
the
drum
.
<EOS>
The
drilling
-
lessons
were
always
protracted
by
episodes
of
warlike
narrative
,
much
more
interesting
to
Tom
than
Philip
's
stories
out
of
the
Iliad
;
for
there
were
no
cannon
in
the
Iliad
,
and
besides
,
Tom
had
felt
some
disgust
on
learning
that
Hector
and
Achilles
might
possibly
never
have
existed
.
<EOS>
But
the
Duke
of
Wellington
was
really
alive
,
and
Bony
had
not
been
long
dead
;
therefore
Mr.
Poulter
's
reminiscences
of
the
Peninsular
War
were
removed
from
all
suspicion
of
being
mythical
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Poulter
,
it
appeared
,
had
been
a
conspicuous
figure
at
Talavera
,
and
had
contributed
not
a
little
to
the
peculiar
terror
with
which
his
regiment
of
infantry
was
regarded
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
On
afternoons
when
his
memory
was
more
stimulated
than
usual
,
he
remembered
that
the
Duke
of
Wellington
had
(
in
strict
privacy
,
lest
jealousies
should
be
awakened
)
<EOS>
expressed
his
esteem
for
that
fine
fellow
Poulter
.
<EOS>
The
very
surgeon
who
attended
him
in
the
hospital
after
he
had
received
his
gunshot
-
wound
had
been
profoundly
impressed
with
the
superiority
of
Mr.
Poulter
's
flesh
,
 
no
other
flesh
would
have
healed
in
anything
like
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
On
less
personal
matters
connected
with
the
important
warfare
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
,
Mr.
Poulter
was
more
reticent
,
only
taking
care
not
to
give
the
weight
of
his
authority
to
any
loose
notions
concerning
military
history
.
<EOS>
Any
one
who
pretended
to
a
knowledge
of
what
occurred
at
the
siege
of
Badajos
was
especially
an
object
of
silent
pity
to
Mr.
Poulter
;
he
wished
that
prating
person
had
been
run
down
,
and
had
the
breath
trampled
out
of
him
at
the
first
go
-
off
,
as
he
himself
had
,
 
he
might
talk
about
the
siege
of
Badajos
then
!
<EOS>
Tom
did
not
escape
irritating
his
drilling
-
master
occasionally
,
by
his
curiosity
concerning
other
military
matters
than
Mr.
Poulter
's
personal
experience
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
General
Wolfe
,
Mr.
Poulter
,
 
was
n't
he
a
wonderful
fighter
?
"
said
Tom
,
who
held
the
notion
that
all
the
martial
heroes
commemorated
on
the
public
-
house
signs
were
engaged
in
the
war
with
Bony
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
!
"
said
Mr.
Poulter
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nothing
o
'
the
sort
!
<EOS>
Heads
up
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
in
a
tone
of
stern
command
,
which
delighted
Tom
,
and
made
him
feel
as
if
he
were
a
regiment
in
his
own
person
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Poulter
would
continue
,
on
coming
to
a
pause
in
his
discipline
;
"
they
'd
better
not
talk
to
me
about
General
Wolfe
.
<EOS>
He
did
nothing
but
die
of
his
wound
;
that
's
a
poor
haction
,
I
consider
.
<EOS>
Any
other
man
'
ud
have
died
o
'
the
wounds
I
've
had
.
<EOS>
One
of
my
sword
-
cuts
'
ud
ha
'
killed
a
fellow
like
General
Wolfe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Poulter
,
"
Tom
would
say
,
at
any
allusion
to
the
sword
,
"
I
wish
you
'd
bring
your
sword
and
do
the
sword
-
exercise
!
"
  
<EOS>
For
a
long
while
Mr.
Poulter
only
shook
his
head
in
a
significant
manner
at
this
request
,
and
smiled
patronizingly
,
as
Jupiter
may
have
done
when
Semele
urged
her
too
ambitious
request
.
<EOS>
But
one
afternoon
,
when
a
sudden
shower
of
heavy
rain
had
detained
Mr.
Poulter
twenty
minutes
longer
than
usual
at
the
Black
Swan
,
the
sword
was
brought
,
 
just
for
Tom
to
look
at
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
this
is
the
real
sword
you
fought
with
in
all
the
battles
,
Mr.
Poulter
?
"
said
Tom
,
handling
the
hilt
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Has
it
ever
cut
a
Frenchman
's
head
off
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Head
off
?
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
and
would
,
if
he
'd
had
three
heads
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
had
a
gun
and
bayonet
besides
?
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
_
I
_
should
like
the
gun
and
bayonet
best
,
because
you
could
shoot
'em
first
and
spear
'em
after
.
<EOS>
Bang
!
<EOS>
Ps
-
s
-
s
-
s

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tom
gave
the
requisite
pantomime
to
indicate
the
double
enjoyment
of
pulling
the
trigger
and
thrusting
the
spear
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
but
the
sword
's
the
thing
when
you
come
to
close
fighting
,
"
said
Mr.
Poulter
,
involuntarily
falling
in
with
Tom
's
enthusiasm
,
and
drawing
the
sword
so
suddenly
that
Tom
leaped
back
with
much
agility
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
,
Mr.
Poulter
,
if
you
're
going
to
do
the
exercise
,
"
said
Tom
,
a
little
conscious
that
he
had
not
stood
his
ground
as
became
an
Englishman
,
"
let
me
go
and
call
Philip
.
<EOS>
He
'll
like
to
see
you

you
know

"
  
<EOS>
"
What

<EOS>
the
humpbacked
lad
?
<EOS>
"
said
Mr.
Poulter
,
contemptuously
;
"
what

the
use

his
_
looking
on
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh

a
great
deal
about
fighting
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
and
how
they
used
to
fight
with
bows
and
arrows
,
and
battle
-
axes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
him
come
,
then
.
<EOS>
I
'll
show
him
something
different
from
his
bows
and
arrows
,
"
said
Mr.
Poulter
,
coughing
and
drawing
himself
up
,
while
he
gave
a
little
preliminary
play
to
his
wrist
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
ran
in
to
Philip
,
who
was
enjoying
his
afternoon
's
holiday
at
the
piano
,
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
picking
out
tunes
for
himself
and
singing
them
.
<EOS>
He
was
supremely
happy
,
perched
like
an
amorphous
bundle
on
the
high
stool
,
with
his
head
thrown
back
<EOS>
,
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
opposite
cornice
,
and
his
lips
wide
open
,
sending
forth
,
with
all
his
might
<EOS>
,
impromptu
syllables
to
a
tune
of
Arne
's
which
had
hit
his
fancy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Philip
,
"
said
Tom
,
bursting
in
;
"
do
n't
stay
roaring
"
<EOS>
la
la
'
there
;
come
and
see
old
Poulter
do
his
sword
-
exercise
in
the
carriage
-
house
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
jar
of
this
interruption
,
the
discord
of
Tom
's
tones
coming
across
the
notes
to
which
Philip
was
vibrating
in
soul
and
body
,
would
have
been
enough
to
unhinge
his
temper
,
even
if
there
had
been
no
question
of
Poulter
the
drilling
-
master
;
and
Tom
,
in
the
hurry
of
seizing
something
to
say
to
prevent
Mr.
Poulter
from
thinking
he
was
afraid
of
the
sword
when
he
sprang
away
from
it
,
had
alighted
on
this
proposition
to
fetch
Philip
,
though
he
knew
well
enough
that
Philip
hated
to
hear
him
mention
his
drilling
-
lessons
.
<EOS>
Tom
would
never
have
done
so
inconsiderate
a
thing
except
under
the
severe
stress
of
his
personal
pride
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
shuddered
visibly
as
he
paused
from
his
music
.
<EOS>
Then
turning
red
,
he
said
,
with
violent
passion
,
    
"
Get
away
,
you
lumbering
idiot
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
come
bellowing
at
me
;
you
're
not
fit
to
speak
to
anything
but
a
cart
-
horse
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
first
time
Philip
had
been
made
angry
by
him
,
but
Tom
had
never
before
been
assailed
with
verbal
missiles
that
he
understood
so
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
fit
to
speak
to
something
better
than
you
,
you
poor
-
spirited
imp
!
"
<EOS>
said
Tom
,
lighting
up
immediately
at
Philip
's
fire
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
wo
n't
hit
you
,
because
you
're
no
better
than
a
girl
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
an
honest
man
's
son
,
and
_
your
_
father
's
a
rogue
;
everybody
says
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
flung
out
of
the
room
,
and
slammed
the
door
after
him
,
made
strangely
heedless
by
his
anger
;
for
to
slam
doors
within
the
hearing
of
Mrs.
Stelling
,
who
was
probably
not
far
off
,
was
an
offence
only
to
be
wiped
out
by
twenty
lines
of
Virgil
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
that
lady
did
presently
descend
from
her
room
,
in
double
wonder
at
the
noise
and
the
subsequent
cessation
of
Philip
's
music
.
<EOS>
She
found
him
sitting
in
a
heap
on
the
hassock
,
and
crying
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
,
Wakem
?
<EOS>
what
was
that
noise
about
?
<EOS>
Who
slammed
the
door
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
looked
up
,
and
hastily
dried
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
Tulliver
who
came
in
 
to
ask
me
to
go
out
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
are
you
in
trouble
about
?
"
said
Mrs.
Stelling
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
was
not
her
favorite
of
the
two
pupils
;
he
was
less
obliging
than
Tom
,
who
was
made
useful
in
many
ways
.
<EOS>
Still
,
his
father
paid
more
than
Mr.
Tulliver
did
,
and
she
meant
him
to
feel
that
she
behaved
exceedingly
well
to
him
.
<EOS>
Philip
,
however
,
met
her
advances
toward
a
good
understanding
very
much
as
a
caressed
mollusk
meets
an
invitation
to
show
himself
out
of
his
shell
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Stelling
was
not
a
loving
,
tender
-
hearted
woman
;
she
was
a
woman
whose
skirt
sat
well
,
who
adjusted
her
waist
and
patted
her
curls
with
a
preoccupied
air
when
she
inquired
after
your
welfare
.
<EOS>
These
things
,
doubtless
,
represent
a
great
social
power
,
but
it
is
not
the
power
of
love
;
and
no
other
power
could
win
Philip
from
his
personal
reserve
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
in
answer
to
her
question
,
"
My
toothache
came
on
,
and
made
me
hysterical
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
had
been
the
fact
once
,
and
Philip
was
glad
of
the
recollection
;
it
was
like
an
inspiration
to
enable
him
to
excuse
his
crying
.
<EOS>
He
had
to
accept
eau
-
de
-
Cologne
and
to
refuse
creosote
in
consequence
;
but
that
was
easy
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Tom
,
who
had
for
the
first
time
sent
a
poisoned
arrow
into
Philip
's
heart
,
had
returned
to
the
carriage
-
house
,
where
he
found
Mr.
Poulter
,
with
a
fixed
and
earnest
eye
,
wasting
the
perfections
of
his
sword
-
exercise
on
probably
observant
but
inappreciative
rats
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Poulter
was
a
host
in
himself
;
that
is
to
say
,
he
admired
himself
more
than
a
whole
army
of
spectators
could
have
admired
him
.
<EOS>
He
took
no
notice
of
Tom
's
return
,
being
too
entirely
absorbed
in
the
cut
and
thrust
,
 
the
solemn
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
;
and
Tom
,
not
without
a
slight
feeling
of
alarm
at
Mr.
Poulter
's
fixed
eye
and
hungry
-
looking
sword
,
which
seemed
impatient
for
something
else
to
cut
besides
the
air
,
admired
the
performance
from
as
great
a
distance
as
possible
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
Mr.
Poulter
paused
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
,
that
Tom
felt
the
full
charm
of
the
sword
-
exercise
,
and
wished
it
to
be
repeated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Poulter
,
"
said
Tom
,
when
the
sword
was
being
finally
sheathed
,
"
I
wish
you
'd
lend
me
your
sword
a
little
while
to
keep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
no
,
young
gentleman
,
"
said
Mr.
Poulter
,
shaking
his
head
decidedly
;
"
you
might
do
yourself
some
mischief
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
'm
sure
I
would
n't
;
I
'm
sure
I
'd
take
care
and
not
hurt
myself
.
<EOS>
I
should
n't
take
it
out
of
the
sheath
much
,
but
I
could
ground
arms
with
it
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
it
wo
n't
do
,
I
tell
you
;
it
wo
n't
do
,
"
said
Mr.
Poulter
,
preparing
to
depart
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
'
ud
Mr.
Stelling
say
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
say
,
do
,
Mr.
Poulter
!
<EOS>
I
'd
give
you
my
five
-
shilling
piece
if
you
'd
let
me
keep
the
sword
a
week
.
<EOS>
Look
here
!
"
said
Tom
,
reaching
out
the
attractively
large
round
of
silver
.
<EOS>
The
young
dog
calculated
the
effect
as
well
as
if
he
had
been
a
philosopher
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr.
Poulter
,
with
still
deeper
gravity
,
"
you
must
keep
it
out
of
sight
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
I
'll
keep
it
under
the
bed
,
"
said
Tom
,
eagerly
,
"
or
else
at
the
bottom
of
my
large
box
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
let
me
see
,
now
,
whether
you
can
draw
it
out
of
the
sheath
without
hurting
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
That
process
having
been
gone
through
more
than
once
,
Mr.
Poulter
felt
that
he
had
acted
with
scrupulous
conscientiousness
,
and
said
,
"
Well
,
now
,
Master
Tulliver
,
if
I
take
the
crown
-
piece
,
it
is
to
make
sure
as
you
'll
do
no
mischief
with
the
sword
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
indeed
,
Mr.
Poulter
,
"
said
Tom
,
delightedly
handing
him
the
crown
-
piece
,
and
grasping
the
sword
,
which
,
he
thought
,
might
have
been
lighter
with
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
Mr.
Stelling
catches
you
carrying
it
in
?
"
said
Mr.
Poulter
,
pocketing
the
crown
-
piece
provisionally
while
he
raised
this
new
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
always
keeps
in
his
upstairs
study
on
Saturday
afternoon
,
"
said
Tom
,
who
disliked
anything
sneaking
,
but
was
not
disinclined
to
a
little
stratagem
in
a
worthy
cause
.
<EOS>
So
he
carried
off
the
sword
in
triumph
mixed
with
dread
 
dread
that
he
might
encounter
Mr.
or
Mrs.
Stelling
 
to
his
bedroom
,
<EOS>
where
,
after
some
consideration
,
he
hid
it
in
the
closet
behind
some
hanging
clothes
.
<EOS>
That
night
he
fell
asleep
in
the
thought
that
he
would
astonish
Maggie
with
it
when
she
came
,
 
<EOS>
tie
it
round
his
waist
with
his
red
comforter
,
and
make
her
believe
that
the
sword
was
his
own
,
and
that
he
was
going
to
be
a
soldier
.
<EOS>
There
was
nobody
but
Maggie
who
would
be
silly
enough
to
believe
him
,
or
whom
he
dared
allow
to
know
he
had
a
sword
;
and
Maggie
was
really
coming
next
week
to
see
Tom
,
before
she
went
to
a
boarding
-
school
with
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
think
a
lad
of
thirteen
would
have
been
so
childish
,
you
must
be
an
exceptionally
wise
man
,
who
,
although
you
are
devoted
to
a
civil
calling
,
requiring
you
to
look
bland
rather
than
formidable
,
yet
never
,
since
you
had
a
beard
,
threw
yourself
into
a
martial
attitude
,
and
frowned
before
the
looking
-
glass
.
<EOS>
It
is
doubtful
whether
our
soldiers
would
be
maintained
if
there
were
not
pacific
people
at
home
who
like
to
fancy
themselves
soldiers
.
<EOS>
War
,
like
other
dramatic
spectacles
,
might
possibly
cease
for
want
of
a
"
public
.

<EOS>
Maggie
's
Second
Visit
  
<EOS>
This
last
breach
between
the
two
lads
was
not
readily
mended
,
and
for
some
time
they
spoke
to
each
other
no
more
than
was
necessary
.
<EOS>
Their
natural
antipathy
of
temperament
made
resentment
an
easy
passage
to
hatred
,
and
in
Philip
the
transition
seemed
to
have
begun
;
there
was
no
malignity
in
his
disposition
,
but
there
was
a
susceptibility
that
made
him
peculiarly
liable
to
a
strong
sense
of
repulsion
.
<EOS>
The
ox
 
<EOS>
we
may
venture
to
assert
it
on
the
authority
of
a
great
classic
 
is
not
given
to
use
his
teeth
as
an
instrument
of
attack
,
and
Tom
was
an
excellent
bovine
lad
,
who
ran
at
questionable
objects
in
a
truly
ingenious
bovine
manner
;
but
he
had
blundered
on
Philip
's
tenderest
point
,
and
had
caused
him
as
much
acute
pain
as
if
he
had
studied
the
means
with
the
nicest
precision
and
the
most
envenomed
spite
.
<EOS>
Tom
saw
no
reason
why
they
should
not
make
up
this
quarrel
as
they
had
done
many
others
,
by
behaving
as
if
nothing
had
happened
;
for
though
he
had
never
before
said
to
Philip
that
his
father
was
a
rogue
,
this
idea
had
so
habitually
made
part
of
his
feeling
as
to
the
relation
between
himself
and
his
dubious
schoolfellow
,
who
he
could
neither
like
nor
dislike
,
that
the
mere
utterance
did
not
make
such
an
epoch
to
him
as
it
did
to
Philip
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
a
right
to
say
so
when
Philip
hectored
over
_
him
_
,
and
called
him
names
.
<EOS>
But
perceiving
that
his
first
advances
toward
amity
were
not
met
,
he
relapsed
into
his
least
favorable
disposition
toward
Philip
,
and
resolved
never
to
appeal
to
him
either
about
drawing
or
exercise
again
.
<EOS>
They
were
only
so
far
civil
to
each
other
as
was
necessary
to
prevent
their
state
of
feud
from
being
observed
by
Mr.
Stelling
,
who
would
have
"
put
down
"
such
nonsense
with
great
vigor
.
  
<EOS>
When
Maggie
came
,
however
,
she
could
not
help
looking
with
growing
interest
at
the
new
schoolfellow
,
although
he
was
the
son
of
that
wicked
Lawyer
Wakem
,
who
made
her
father
so
angry
.
<EOS>
She
had
arrived
in
the
middle
of
school
-
hours
,
and
had
sat
by
while
Philip
went
through
his
lessons
with
Mr.
Stelling
.
<EOS>
Tom
,
some
weeks
ago
,
had
sent
her
word
that
Philip
knew
no
end
of
stories
,
 
not
stupid
stories
like
hers
;
and
she
was
convinced
now
from
her
own
observation
that
he
must
be
very
clever
;
she
hoped
he
would
think
_
her
_
rather
clever
too
,
when
she
came
to
talk
to
him
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
moreover
,
had
rather
a
tenderness
for
deformed
things
;
she
preferred
the
wry
-
necked
lambs
,
because
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
lambs
which
were
quite
strong
and
well
made
would
n't
mind
so
much
about
being
petted
;
and
she
was
especially
fond
of
petting
objects
that
would
think
it
very
delightful
to
be
petted
by
her
.
<EOS>
She
loved
Tom
very
dearly
,
but
she
often
wished
that
he
_
cared
_
more
about
her
loving
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
Philip
Wakem
seems
a
nice
boy
,
Tom
,
"
she
said
,
when
they
went
out
of
the
study
together
into
the
garden
,
to
pass
the
interval
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
He
could
n't
choose
his
father
,
you
know
;
and
I
've
read
of
very
bad
men
who
had
good
sons
,
as
well
as
good
parents
who
had
bad
children
.
<EOS>
And
if
Philip
is
good
,
I
think
we
ought
to
be
the
more
sorry
for
him
because
his
father
is
not
a
good
man
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
<EOS>
like
him
,
do
n't
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
's
a
queer
fellow
,
"
said
Tom
,
curtly
,
"
and
he
's
as
sulky
as
can
be
with
me
,
because
I
told
him
his
father
was
a
rogue
.
<EOS>
And
I
'd
a
right
to
tell
him
so
,
<EOS>
for
it
was
true
;
and
_
he
_
began
it
,
with
calling
me
names
.
<EOS>
But
you
stop
here
by
yourself
a
bit
,
Maggie
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
I
've
got
something
I
want
to
do
upstairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
I
go
too
?
<EOS>
"
said
Maggie
,
who
in
this
first
day
of
meeting
again
loved
Tom
's
shadow
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
's
something
I
'll
tell
you
about
by
-
and
-
by
,
not
yet
,
"
said
Tom
,
skipping
away
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
the
boys
were
at
their
books
in
the
study
,
preparing
the
morrow
's
lesson
's
that
they
might
have
a
holiday
in
the
evening
in
honor
of
Maggie
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
Tom
was
hanging
over
his
Latin
grammar
,
moving
his
lips
inaudibly
like
a
strict
but
impatient
Catholic
repeating
his
tale
of
paternosters
;
and
Philip
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
was
busy
with
two
volumes
,
with
a
look
of
contented
diligence
that
excited
Maggie
's
curiosity
;
he
did
not
look
at
all
as
if
he
were
learning
a
lesson
.
<EOS>
She
sat
on
a
low
stool
at
nearly
a
right
angle
with
the
two
boys
,
watching
first
one
<EOS>
and
then
the
other
;
and
Philip
,
looking
off
his
book
once
toward
the
fire
-
place
,
caught
the
pair
of
questioning
dark
eyes
fixed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
thought
this
sister
of
Tulliver
's
seemed
a
nice
little
thing
,
quite
unlike
her
brother
;
he
wished
_
<EOS>
he
_
had
a
little
sister
.
<EOS>
What
was
it
,
he
wondered
,
that
made
Maggie
's
dark
eyes
remind
him
of
the
stories
about
princesses
being
turned
into
animals
?
<EOS>
I
think
it
was
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
unsatisfied
intelligence
,
and
unsatisfied
beseeching
affection
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Magsie
,
"
said
Tom
at
last
,
shutting
his
books
and
putting
them
away
with
the
energy
and
decision
of
a
perfect
master
in
the
art
of
leaving
off
,
"
I
've
done
my
lessons
now
.
<EOS>
Come
upstairs
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
said
Maggie
,
when
they
were
outside
the
door
,
a
slight
suspicion
crossing
her
mind
as
she
remembered
Tom
's
preliminary
visit
upstairs
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
a
trick
you
're
going
to
play
me
,
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
Maggie
,
"
said
Tom
,
in
his
most
coaxing
tone
;
"
It
's
something
you
'll
like
_
<EOS>
ever
so
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
his
arm
round
her
neck
,
and
she
put
hers
round
his
waist
,
and
twined
together
in
this
way
,
they
went
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Magsie
,
you
must
not
tell
anybody
,
you
know
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
else
I
shall
get
fifty
lines
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
alive
?
"
said
Maggie
,
whose
imagination
had
settled
for
the
moment
on
the
idea
that
Tom
kept
a
ferret
clandestinely
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
sha'n"t
tell
you
,
"
said
he
.
"
<EOS>
Now
you
go
into
that
corner
and
hide
your
face
,
while
I
reach
it
out
,
"
he
added
,
as
he
locked
the
bedroom
door
behind
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
when
to
turn
round
.
<EOS>
You
must
n't
squeal
out
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
if
you
frighten
me
,
I
shall
,
"
said
Maggie
,
beginning
to
look
rather
serious
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
be
frightened
,
you
silly
thing
,
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
Go
and
hide
your
face
,
and
mind
you
do
n't
peep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
sha'n"t
peep
,
"
said
Maggie
,
disdainfully
;
and
she
buried
her
face
in
the
pillow
like
a
person
of
strict
honor
.
  
<EOS>
But
Tom
looked
round
warily
as
he
walked
to
the
closet
;
then
he
stepped
into
the
narrow
space
,
and
almost
closed
the
door
.
<EOS>
Maggie
kept
her
face
buried
without
the
aid
of
principle
,
for
in
that
dream
-
suggestive
attitude
she
had
soon
forgotten
where
she
was
,
and
her
thoughts
were
busy
with
the
poor
deformed
boy
,
who
was
so
clever
,
when
Tom
called
out
,
"
Now
then
,
Magsie
!
"
  
<EOS>
Nothing
but
long
meditation
and
preconcerted
arrangement
of
effects
would
have
enabled
Tom
to
present
so
striking
a
figure
as
he
did
to
Maggie
when
she
looked
up
.
<EOS>
Dissatisfied
with
the
pacific
aspect
of
a
face
which
had
no
more
than
the
faintest
hint
of
flaxen
eyebrow
,
together
with
a
pair
of
amiable
blue
-
gray
eyes
and
round
pink
cheeks
that
refused
to
look
formidable
,
let
him
frown
as
he
would
before
the
looking
-
glass
(
Philip
had
once
told
him
of
a
man
who
had
a
horseshoe
frown
,
and
Tom
had
tried
with
all
his
frowning
might
to
make
a
horseshoe
on
his
forehead
)
,
he
had
had
recourse
to
that
unfailing
source
of
the
terrible
,
burnt
cork
,
and
had
made
himself
a
pair
of
black
eyebrows
that
met
in
a
satisfactory
manner
over
his
nose
,
and
were
matched
by
a
less
carefully
adjusted
blackness
about
the
chin
.
<EOS>
He
had
wound
a
red
handkerchief
round
his
cloth
cap
to
give
it
the
air
of
a
turban
,
and
his
red
comforter
across
his
breast
as
a
scarf
,
 
an
amount
of
red
which
,
with
the
tremendous
frown
on
his
brow
,
and
the
decision
with
which
he
grasped
the
sword
,
as
he
held
it
with
its
point
resting
on
the
ground
,
would
suffice
to
convey
an
approximate
idea
of
his
fierce
and
bloodthirsty
disposition
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
looked
bewildered
for
a
moment
,
and
Tom
enjoyed
that
moment
keenly
;
but
in
the
next
she
laughed
,
clapped
her
hands
together
,
and
said
,
"
Oh
,
Tom
,
you
've
made
yourself
like
Bluebeard
at
the
show
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
clear
she
had
not
been
struck
with
the
presence
of
the
sword
,
 
it
was
not
unsheathed
.
<EOS>
Her
frivolous
mind
required
a
more
direct
appeal
to
its
sense
of
the
terrible
,
and
Tom
prepared
for
his
master
-
stroke
.
<EOS>
Frowning
with
a
double
amount
of
intention
,
if
not
of
corrugation
,
he
(
carefully
)
drew
the
sword
from
its
sheath
,
and
pointed
it
at
Maggie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Tom
,
please
do
n't
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Maggie
,
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
dread
,
shrinking
away
from
him
into
the
opposite
corner
.
<EOS>
"
I
_
shall
_
scream
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
shall
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
do
n't
I
wish
I
'd
never
come
upstairs
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
corners
of
Tom
's
mouth
showed
an
inclination
to
a
smile
of
complacency
that
was
immediately
checked
as
inconsistent
with
the
severity
of
a
great
warrior
.
<EOS>
Slowly
he
let
down
the
scabbard
on
the
floor
,
lest
it
should
make
too
much
noise
,
and
then
said
sternly
,
    
"
I
'm
the
Duke
of
Wellington
!
<EOS>
March
!
<EOS>
"
stamping
forward
with
the
right
leg
a
little
bent
,
and
the
sword
still
pointing
toward
Maggie
,
who
,
trembling
,
and
with
tear
-
filled
eyes
,
got
upon
the
bed
,
as
the
only
means
of
widening
the
space
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
,
happy
in
this
spectator
of
his
military
performances
,
even
though
the
spectator
was
only
Maggie
,
proceeded
,
with
the
utmost
exertion
of
his
force
,
to
such
an
exhibition
of
the
cut
and
thrust
as
would
necessarily
be
expected
of
the
Duke
of
Wellington
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
I
_
will
not
_
bear
it
,
I
_
will
_
scream
,
"
said
Maggie
,
at
the
first
movement
of
the
sword
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
hurt
yourself
;
you
'll
cut
your
head
off
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
 
two
,
"
said
Tom
,
resolutely
,
though
at
"
two
"
his
wrist
trembled
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Three
"
came
more
slowly
,
and
with
it
the
sword
swung
downward
,
and
Maggie
gave
a
loud
shriek
.
<EOS>
The
sword
had
fallen
,
with
its
edge
on
Tom
's
foot
,
and
in
a
moment
after
he
had
fallen
too
.
<EOS>
Maggie
leaped
from
the
bed
,
still
shrieking
,
and
immediately
there
was
a
rush
of
footsteps
toward
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
,
from
his
upstairs
study
,
was
the
first
to
enter
.
<EOS>
He
found
both
the
children
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Tom
had
fainted
,
and
Maggie
was
shaking
him
by
the
collar
of
his
jacket
,
screaming
,
with
wild
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
thought
he
was
dead
,
poor
child
!
<EOS>
and
yet
she
shook
him
,
as
if
that
would
bring
him
back
to
life
.
<EOS>
In
another
minute
she
was
sobbing
with
joy
because
Tom
opened
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
could
n't
sorrow
yet
that
he
had
hurt
his
foot
;
it
seemed
as
if
all
happiness
lay
in
his
being
alive
.
    
<EOS>
A
Love
-
Scene
  
<EOS>
Poor
Tom
bore
his
severe
pain
heroically
,
and
was
resolute
in
not
"
telling
"
of
Mr.
Poulter
<EOS>
more
than
was
unavoidable
;
the
five
-
shilling
piece
remained
a
secret
even
to
Maggie
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
terrible
dread
weighing
on
his
mind
,
so
terrible
that
he
dared
not
even
ask
the
question
which
might
bring
the
fatal
"
yes
"
;
he
dared
not
ask
the
surgeon
or
Mr.
Stelling
,
"
Shall
I
be
lame
,
Sir
?
"
<EOS>
He
mastered
himself
so
as
not
to
cry
out
at
the
pain
;
but
when
his
foot
had
been
dressed
,
and
he
was
left
alone
with
Maggie
seated
by
his
bedside
,
the
children
sobbed
together
,
with
their
heads
laid
on
the
same
pillow
.
<EOS>
Tom
was
thinking
of
himself
walking
about
on
crutches
,
like
the
wheelwright
's
son
;
and
Maggie
,
who
did
not
guess
what
was
in
his
mind
,
sobbed
for
company
.
<EOS>
It
had
not
occurred
to
the
surgeon
or
to
Mr.
Stelling
to
anticipate
this
dread
in
Tom
's
mind
,
and
to
reassure
him
by
hopeful
words
.
<EOS>
But
Philip
watched
the
surgeon
out
of
the
house
,
and
waylaid
Mr.
Stelling
to
ask
the
very
question
that
Tom
had
not
dared
to
ask
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
 
but
does
Mr.
Askern
say
Tulliver
will
be
lame
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
;
oh
,
no
,
"
said
Mr.
Stelling
,
"
not
permanently
;
only
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
he
tell
Tulliver
<EOS>
so
,
sir
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
nothing
was
said
to
him
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
may
I
go
and
tell
him
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
to
be
sure
;
now
you
mention
it
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
he
may
be
troubling
about
that
.
<EOS>
Go
to
his
bedroom
,
but
be
very
quiet
at
present
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
had
been
Philip
's
first
thought
when
he
heard
of
the
accident
,
 
"
Will
Tulliver
be
lame
?
<EOS>
It
will
be
very
hard
for
him
if
he
is
"
;
and
Tom
's
hitherto
unforgiven
offences
were
washed
out
by
that
pity
.
<EOS>
Philip
felt
that
they
were
no
longer
in
a
state
of
repulsion
,
but
were
being
drawn
into
a
common
current
of
suffering
and
sad
privation
.
<EOS>
His
imagination
did
not
dwell
on
the
outward
calamity
and
its
future
effect
on
Tom
's
life
,
but
it
made
vividly
present
to
him
the
probable
state
of
Tom
's
feeling
.
<EOS>
Philip
had
only
lived
fourteen
years
,
but
those
years
had
,
most
of
them
,
been
steeped
in
the
sense
of
a
lot
irremediably
hard
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Askern
says
you
'll
soon
be
all
right
again
,
Tulliver
,
did
you
know
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
rather
timidly
,
as
he
stepped
gently
up
to
Tom
's
bed
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
just
been
to
ask
Mr.
Stelling
,
and
he
says
you
'll
walk
as
well
as
ever
again
by
-
and
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
looked
up
with
that
momentary
stopping
of
the
breath
which
comes
with
a
sudden
joy
;
then
he
gave
a
long
sigh
,
and
turned
his
blue
-
gray
eyes
straight
on
Philip
's
face
,
as
he
had
not
done
for
a
fortnight
or
more
.
<EOS>
As
for
Maggie
,
this
intimation
of
a
possibility
she
had
not
thought
of
before
affected
her
as
a
new
trouble
;
the
bare
idea
of
Tom
's
being
always
lame
overpowered
the
assurance
that
such
a
misfortune
was
not
likely
to
befall
him
,
and
she
clung
to
him
and
cried
afresh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
a
little
silly
,
Magsie
,
"
said
Tom
,
tenderly
,
feeling
very
brave
now
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
soon
get
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
by
,
Tulliver
,
"
said
Philip
,
putting
out
his
small
,
delicate
hand
,
which
Tom
clasped
immediately
with
his
more
substantial
fingers
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
ask
Mr.
Stelling
to
let
you
come
and
sit
with
me
sometimes
,
till
I
get
up
again
,
Wakem
;
and
tell
me
about
Robert
Bruce
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
that
,
Philip
spent
all
his
time
out
of
school
-
hours
with
Tom
and
Maggie
.
<EOS>
Tom
liked
to
hear
fighting
stories
as
much
as
ever
,
but
he
insisted
strongly
on
the
fact
that
those
great
fighters
who
did
so
many
wonderful
things
and
came
off
unhurt
,
wore
excellent
armor
from
head
to
foot
,
which
made
fighting
easy
work
,
he
considered
.
<EOS>
He
should
not
have
hurt
his
foot
if
he
had
had
an
iron
shoe
on
.
<EOS>
He
listened
with
great
interest
to
a
new
story
of
Philip
's
about
a
man
who
had
a
very
bad
wound
in
his
foot
,
and
cried
out
so
dreadfully
with
the
pain
that
his
friends
could
bear
with
him
no
longer
,
but
put
him
ashore
on
a
desert
island
,
with
nothing
but
some
wonderful
poisoned
arrows
to
kill
animals
with
for
food
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
roar
out
a
bit
,
you
know
,
"
Tom
said
,
"
and
I
dare
say
my
foot
was
as
bad
as
his
.
<EOS>
It
's
cowardly
to
roar
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Maggie
would
have
it
that
when
anything
hurt
you
very
much
,
it
was
quite
permissible
to
cry
out
,
and
it
was
cruel
of
people
not
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
to
know
if
Philoctetes
had
a
sister
,
and
why
_
she
_
did
n't
go
with
him
on
the
desert
island
and
take
care
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
,
soon
after
Philip
had
told
this
story
,
he
and
Maggie
were
in
the
study
alone
together
while
Tom
's
foot
was
being
dressed
.
<EOS>
Philip
was
at
his
books
,
and
Maggie
,
after
sauntering
idly
round
the
room
,
not
caring
to
do
anything
in
particular
,
because
she
would
soon
go
to
Tom
again
,
went
and
leaned
on
the
table
near
Philip
to
see
what
he
was
doing
,
for
they
were
quite
old
friends
now
,
and
perfectly
at
home
with
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
reading
about
in
Greek
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
poetry
,
I
can
see
that
,
because
the
lines
are
so
short
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
about
Philoctetes
,
the
lame
man
I
was
telling
you
of
yesterday
,
"
he
answered
,
resting
his
head
on
his
hand
,
and
looking
at
her
as
if
he
were
not
at
all
sorry
to
be
interrupted
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
in
her
absent
way
,
continued
to
lean
forward
,
resting
on
her
arms
and
moving
her
feet
about
,
while
her
dark
eyes
got
more
and
more
fixed
and
vacant
,
as
if
she
had
quite
forgotten
Philip
and
his
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
"
said
Philip
,
after
a
minute
or
two
,
still
leaning
on
his
elbow
and
looking
at
her
,
"
if
you
had
had
a
brother
like
me
,
do
you
think
you
should
have
loved
him
as
well
as
Tom
?
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
started
a
little
on
being
roused
from
her
reverie
,
and
said
,
"
What
?
"
<EOS>
Philip
repeated
his
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
better
,
"
she
answered
immediately
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
not
better
;
because
I
do
n't
think
I
_
could
_
love
you
better
than
Tom
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
be
so
sorry
,
 
_
<EOS>
so
sorry
_
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
colored
;
he
had
meant
to
imply
,
would
she
love
him
as
well
in
spite
of
his
deformity
,
and
yet
when
she
alluded
to
it
so
plainly
,
he
winced
under
her
pity
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
young
as
she
was
,
felt
her
mistake
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
she
had
instinctively
behaved
as
if
she
were
quite
unconscious
of
Philip
's
deformity
;
her
own
keen
sensitiveness
and
experience
under
family
criticism
sufficed
to
teach
her
this
as
well
as
if
she
had
been
directed
by
the
most
finished
breeding
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
so
very
clever
,
Philip
,
and
you
can
play
and
sing
,
"
she
added
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
_
were
_
<EOS>
my
brother
.
<EOS>
I
'm
very
fond
of
you
.
<EOS>
And
you
would
stay
at
home
with
me
when
Tom
went
out
,
and
you
would
teach
me
everything
;
would
n't
you
,
 
Greek
and
everything
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
'll
go
away
soon
,
and
go
to
school
,
Maggie
,
"
said
Philip
,
"
and
then
you
'll
forget
all
about
me
,
and
not
care
for
me
any
more
.
<EOS>
And
then
I
shall
see
you
when
you
're
grown
up
,
and
you
'll
hardly
take
any
notice
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
I
sha'n"t
forget
you
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
said
Maggie
,
shaking
her
head
very
seriously
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
forget
anything
,
and
I
think
about
everybody
when
I
'm
away
from
them
.
<EOS>
I
think
about
poor
Yap
;
he
's
got
a
lump
in
his
throat
,
and
Luke
says
he
'll
die
.
<EOS>
Only
do
n't
you
tell
Tom
.
<EOS>
because
it
will
vex
him
so
.
<EOS>
You
never
saw
Yap
;
he
's
a
queer
little
dog
,
 
nobody
cares
about
him
but
Tom
and
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
care
as
much
about
me
as
you
do
about
Yap
,
Maggie
?
"
<EOS>
said
Philip
,
smiling
rather
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
I
should
think
so
,
"
said
Maggie
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
fond
of
_
you
_
,
Maggie
;
I
shall
never
forget
_
you
_
,
"
said
Philip
,
"
and
when
I
'm
very
unhappy
,
I
shall
always
think
of
you
,
and
wish
I
had
a
sister
with
dark
eyes
,
just
like
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
like
my
eyes
?
<EOS>
"
said
Maggie
,
well
pleased
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
heard
any
one
but
her
father
speak
of
her
eyes
as
if
they
had
merit
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
They
're
not
like
any
other
eyes
.
<EOS>
They
seem
trying
to
speak
,
 
trying
to
speak
kindly
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
other
people
to
look
at
me
much
,
but
I
like
you
to
look
at
me
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
think
you
're
fonder
of
me
than
Tom
is
,
"
said
Maggie
,
rather
sorrowfully
.
<EOS>
Then
,
wondering
how
she
could
convince
Philip
that
she
could
like
him
just
as
well
,
although
he
was
crooked
,
she
said
:
  
"
<EOS>
Should
you
like
me
to
kiss
you
,
as
I
do
Tom
?
<EOS>
I
will
,
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
very
much
;
nobody
kisses
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
put
her
arm
<EOS>
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
quite
earnestly
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
now
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
shall
always
remember
you
,
and
kiss
you
when
I
see
you
again
,
if
it
's
ever
so
long
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
go
now
,
because
I
think
Mr.
Askern
's
done
with
Tom
's
foot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
their
father
came
the
second
time
,
Maggie
said
to
him
,
"
Oh
,
father
,
Philip
Wakem
is
so
very
good
to
Tom
;
he
is
such
a
clever
boy
,
and
I
_
do
_
love
him
.
<EOS>
And
you
love
him
too
,
Tom
,
do
n't
you
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Say
_
<EOS>
you
love
him
,
"
she
added
entreatingly
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
colored
a
little
as
he
looked
at
his
father
,
and
said
:
"
I
sha'n"t
be
friends
with
him
when
I
leave
school
,
father
;
but
we
've
made
it
up
now
,
since
my
foot
has
been
bad
,
and
he
's
taught
me
to
play
at
draughts
,
and
I
can
beat
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
"
if
he
's
good
to
you
,
try
and
make
him
amends
,
and
be
good
to
_
him
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
poor
crooked
creature
,
and
takes
after
his
dead
mother
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
you
be
getting
too
thick
with
him
;
he
's
got
his
father
's
blood
in
him
too
.
<EOS>
Ay
,
ay
,
the
gray
colt
may
chance
to
kick
like
his
black
sire
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
jarring
natures
of
the
two
boys
effected
what
Mr.
Tulliver
's
admonition
alone
might
have
failed
to
effect
;
in
spite
of
Philip
's
new
kindness
,
and
Tom
's
answering
regard
in
this
time
of
his
trouble
,
they
never
became
close
friends
.
<EOS>
When
Maggie
was
gone
,
and
when
Tom
by
-
and
-
by
began
to
walk
about
as
usual
,
the
friendly
warmth
that
had
been
kindled
by
pity
and
gratitude
died
out
by
degrees
,
and
left
them
in
their
old
relation
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Philip
was
often
peevish
and
contemptuous
;
and
Tom
's
more
specific
and
kindly
impressions
gradually
melted
into
the
old
background
of
suspicion
and
dislike
toward
him
as
a
queer
fellow
,
a
humpback
,
and
the
son
of
a
rogue
.
<EOS>
If
boys
and
men
are
to
be
welded
together
in
the
glow
of
transient
feeling
,
they
must
be
made
of
metal
that
will
mix
,
else
they
inevitably
fall
asunder
when
the
heat
dies
out
.
    
<EOS>
The
Golden
Gates
Are
Passed
  
<EOS>
So
Tom
went
on
even
to
the
fifth
half
-
year
 
till
he
was
turned
sixteen
 
at
King
's
Lorton
,
while
Maggie
was
growing
with
a
rapidity
which
her
aunts
considered
highly
reprehensible
,
at
Miss
Firniss
's
boarding
-
school
in
the
ancient
town
of
Laceham
on
the
Floss
,
with
cousin
Lucy
for
her
companion
.
<EOS>
In
her
early
letters
to
Tom
she
had
always
sent
her
love
to
Philip
,
and
asked
many
questions
about
him
,
which
were
answered
by
brief
sentences
about
Tom
's
toothache
,
and
a
turf
-
house
which
he
was
helping
to
build
in
the
garden
,
with
other
items
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
She
was
pained
to
hear
Tom
say
in
the
holidays
that
Philip
was
as
queer
as
ever
again
,
and
often
cross
.
<EOS>
They
were
no
longer
very
good
friends
,
she
perceived
;
and
when
she
reminded
Tom
that
he
ought
always
to
love
Philip
for
being
so
good
to
him
when
his
foot
was
bad
,
he
answered
:
"
Well
,
it
is
n't
my
fault
;
_
I
_
do
n't
do
anything
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
She
hardly
ever
saw
Philip
during
the
remainder
of
their
school
-
life
;
in
the
Midsummer
holidays
he
was
always
away
at
the
seaside
,
and
at
Christmas
she
could
only
meet
him
at
long
intervals
in
the
street
of
St.
Ogg
's
.
<EOS>
When
they
did
meet
,
she
remembered
her
promise
to
kiss
him
,
but
,
as
a
young
lady
who
had
been
at
a
boarding
-
school
,
she
knew
now
that
such
a
greeting
was
out
of
the
question
,
and
Philip
would
not
expect
it
.
<EOS>
The
promise
was
void
,
like
so
many
other
sweet
,
illusory
promises
of
our
childhood
;
void
as
promises
made
in
Eden
before
the
seasons
were
divided
,
and
when
the
starry
blossoms
grew
side
by
side
with
the
ripening
peach
,
 
impossible
to
be
fulfilled
when
the
golden
gates
had
been
passed
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
their
father
was
actually
engaged
in
the
long
-
threatened
lawsuit
,
and
Wakem
,
as
the
agent
at
once
of
Pivart
and
Old
Harry
,
was
acting
against
him
,
even
Maggie
felt
,
with
some
sadness
,
that
they
were
not
likely
ever
to
have
any
intimacy
with
Philip
again
;
the
very
name
of
Wakem
made
her
father
angry
,
and
she
had
once
heard
him
say
that
if
that
crook
-
backed
son
lived
to
inherit
his
father
's
ill
-
gotten
gains
,
there
would
be
a
curse
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
as
little
to
do
with
him
at
school
as
you
can
,
my
lad
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
to
Tom
;
and
the
command
was
obeyed
the
more
easily
because
Mr.
Sterling
by
this
time
had
two
additional
pupils
;
for
though
this
gentleman
's
rise
in
the
world
was
not
of
that
meteor
-
like
rapidity
which
the
admirers
of
his
extemporaneous
eloquence
had
expected
for
a
preacher
whose
voice
demanded
so
wide
a
sphere
,
he
had
yet
enough
of
growing
prosperity
to
enable
him
to
increase
his
expenditure
in
continued
disproportion
to
his
income
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
Tom
's
school
course
,
it
went
on
with
mill
-
like
monotony
,
his
mind
continuing
to
move
with
a
slow
,
half
-
stifled
pulse
in
a
medium
uninteresting
or
unintelligible
ideas
.
<EOS>
But
each
vacation
he
brought
home
larger
and
larger
drawings
with
the
satiny
rendering
of
landscape
,
and
water
-
colors
in
vivid
greens
,
together
with
manuscript
books
full
of
exercises
and
problems
,
in
which
the
handwriting
was
all
the
finer
because
he
gave
his
whole
mind
to
it
.
<EOS>
Each
vacation
he
brought
home
a
new
book
or
two
,
indicating
his
progress
through
different
stages
of
history
,
Christian
doctrine
,
and
Latin
literature
;
and
that
passage
was
not
entirely
without
results
,
besides
the
possession
of
the
books
.
<EOS>
Tom
's
ear
and
tongue
had
become
accustomed
to
a
great
many
words
and
phrases
which
are
understood
to
be
signs
of
an
educated
condition
;
and
though
he
had
never
really
applied
his
mind
to
any
one
of
his
lessons
,
the
lessons
had
left
a
deposit
of
vague
,
fragmentary
,
ineffectual
notions
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
,
seeing
signs
of
acquirement
beyond
the
reach
of
his
own
criticism
,
thought
it
was
probably
all
right
with
Tom
's
education
;
he
observed
,
indeed
,
that
there
were
no
maps
,
and
not
enough
"
summing
"
;
but
he
made
no
formal
complaint
to
Mr.
Stelling
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
puzzling
business
,
this
schooling
;
and
if
he
took
Tom
away
,
where
could
he
send
him
with
better
effect
?
  
<EOS>
By
the
time
Tom
had
reached
his
last
quarter
at
King
's
Lorton
,
the
years
had
made
striking
changes
in
him
since
the
day
we
saw
him
returning
from
Mr.
Jacobs
's
academy
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
tall
youth
now
,
carrying
himself
without
the
least
awkwardness
,
and
speaking
without
more
shyness
than
was
a
becoming
symptom
of
blended
diffidence
and
pride
;
he
wore
his
tail
-
coat
and
his
stand
-
up
collars
,
and
watched
the
down
on
his
lip
with
eager
impatience
,
looking
every
day
at
his
virgin
razor
,
with
which
he
had
provided
himself
in
the
last
holidays
.
<EOS>
Philip
had
already
left
,
 
at
the
autumn
quarter
,
 
that
he
might
go
to
the
south
for
the
winter
,
for
the
sake
of
his
health
;
and
this
change
helped
to
give
Tom
the
unsettled
,
exultant
feeling
that
usually
belongs
to
the
last
months
before
leaving
school
.
<EOS>
This
quarter
,
too
,
there
was
some
hope
of
his
father
's
lawsuit
being
decided
;
_
that
_
made
the
prospect
of
home
more
entirely
pleasurable
.
<EOS>
For
Tom
,
who
had
gathered
his
view
of
the
case
from
his
father
's
conversation
,
had
no
doubt
that
Pivart
would
be
beaten
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
had
not
heard
anything
from
home
for
some
weeks
,
 
a
fact
which
did
not
surprise
him
,
for
his
father
and
mother
were
not
apt
to
manifest
their
affection
in
unnecessary
letters
,
 
when
,
to
his
great
surprise
,
on
the
morning
of
a
dark
,
cold
day
near
the
end
of
November
,
he
was
told
,
soon
after
entering
the
study
at
nine
o'clock
,
that
his
sister
was
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
It
was
Mrs.
Stelling
who
had
come
into
the
study
to
tell
him
,
and
she
left
him
to
enter
the
drawing
-
room
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
,
too
,
was
tall
now
,
with
braided
and
coiled
hair
;
she
was
almost
as
tall
as
Tom
,
though
she
was
only
thirteen
;
and
she
really
looked
older
than
he
did
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
She
had
thrown
off
her
bonnet
,
her
heavy
braids
were
pushed
back
from
her
forehead
,
as
if
it
would
not
bear
that
extra
load
,
and
her
young
face
had
a
strangely
worn
look
,
as
her
eyes
turned
anxiously
toward
the
door
.
<EOS>
When
Tom
entered
she
did
not
speak
,
but
only
went
up
to
him
,
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
,
and
kissed
him
earnestly
.
<EOS>
He
was
used
to
various
moods
of
hers
,
and
felt
no
alarm
at
the
unusual
seriousness
of
her
greeting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
is
it
<EOS>
you
're
come
so
early
this
cold
morning
,
Maggie
?
<EOS>
Did
you
come
in
the
gig
?
"
<EOS>
said
Tom
,
as
she
backed
toward
the
sofa
,
and
drew
him
to
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
came
by
the
coach
.
<EOS>
I
've
walked
from
the
turnpike
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
how
is
it
<EOS>
you
're
not
at
school
?
<EOS>
The
holidays
have
not
begun
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Father
wanted
me
at
home
,
"
said
Maggie
,
with
a
slight
trembling
of
the
lip
.
<EOS>
"
I
came
home
three
or
four
days
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Is
n't
my
father
well
?
"
said
Tom
,
rather
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
,
"
said
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
very
unhappy
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
The
lawsuit
is
ended
,
and
I
came
to
tell
you
because
I
thought
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
know
it
before
you
came
home
,
and
I
did
n't
like
only
to
send
you
a
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
has
n't
lost
?
"
said
Tom
,
hastily
,
springing
from
the
sofa
,
and
standing
before
Maggie
with
his
hands
suddenly
thrust
into
his
pockets
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
dear
Tom
,
"
said
Maggie
,
looking
up
at
him
with
trembling
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
was
silent
a
minute
or
two
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Then
he
said
:
  
"
My
father
will
have
to
pay
a
good
deal
of
money
,
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Maggie
,
rather
faintly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
ca
n't
be
helped
,
"
said
Tom
,
bravely
,
not
translating
the
loss
of
a
large
sum
of
money
into
any
tangible
results
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
my
father
's
very
much
vexed
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
looking
at
Maggie
,
and
thinking
that
her
agitated
face
was
only
part
of
her
girlish
way
of
taking
things
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Maggie
,
again
faintly
.
<EOS>
Then
,
urged
to
fuller
speech
by
Tom
's
freedom
from
apprehension
,
she
said
loudly
and
rapidly
,
as
if
the
words
_
would
_
burst
from
her
:
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Tom
,
he
will
lose
the
mill
and
the
land
and
everything
;
he
will
have
nothing
left
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
's
eyes
flashed
out
one
look
of
surprise
at
her
,
before
he
turned
pale
,
and
trembled
visibly
.
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
,
but
sat
down
on
the
sofa
again
,
looking
vaguely
out
of
the
opposite
window
.
  
<EOS>
Anxiety
about
the
future
had
never
entered
Tom
's
mind
.
<EOS>
His
father
had
always
ridden
a
good
horse
,
kept
a
good
house
,
and
had
the
cheerful
,
confident
air
of
a
man
who
has
plenty
of
property
to
fall
back
upon
.
<EOS>
Tom
had
never
dreamed
that
his
father
would
"
fail
"
;
_
that
_
was
a
form
of
misfortune
which
he
had
always
heard
spoken
of
as
a
deep
disgrace
,
and
disgrace
was
an
idea
that
he
could
not
associate
with
any
of
his
relations
,
least
of
all
with
his
father
.
<EOS>
A
proud
sense
of
family
respectability
was
part
of
the
very
air
Tom
had
been
born
and
brought
up
in
.
<EOS>
He
knew
there
were
people
in
St.
Ogg
's
who
made
a
show
without
money
to
support
it
,
and
he
had
always
heard
such
people
spoken
of
by
his
own
friends
with
contempt
and
reprobation
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
strong
belief
,
which
was
a
lifelong
habit
,
and
required
no
definite
evidence
to
rest
on
,
that
his
father
could
spend
a
great
deal
of
money
if
he
chose
;
and
since
his
education
at
Mr.
Stelling
's
had
given
him
a
more
expensive
view
of
life
,
he
had
often
thought
that
when
he
got
older
he
would
make
a
figure
in
the
world
,
with
his
horse
and
dogs
and
saddle
,
and
other
accoutrements
of
a
fine
young
man
,
and
show
himself
equal
to
any
of
his
contemporaries
at
St.
Ogg
's
,
who
might
consider
themselves
a
grade
above
him
in
society
because
their
fathers
were
professional
men
,
or
had
large
oil
-
mills
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
prognostics
and
headshaking
of
his
aunts
and
uncles
,
they
had
never
produced
the
least
effect
on
him
,
except
to
make
him
think
that
aunts
and
uncles
were
disagreeable
society
;
he
had
heard
them
find
fault
in
much
the
same
way
as
long
as
he
could
remember
.
<EOS>
His
father
knew
better
than
they
did
.
  
<EOS>
The
down
had
come
on
Tom
's
lip
,
yet
his
thoughts
and
expectations
had
been
hitherto
only
the
reproduction
,
in
changed
forms
,
of
the
boyish
dreams
in
which
he
had
lived
three
years
ago
.
<EOS>
He
was
awakened
now
with
a
violent
shock
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
was
frightened
at
Tom
's
pale
,
trembling
silence
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
else
to
tell
him
,
 
something
worse
.
<EOS>
She
threw
her
arms
round
him
at
last
,
and
said
,
with
a
half
sob
:
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Tom
 
dear
,
dear
Tom
,
do
n't
fret
too
much
;
try
and
bear
it
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
turned
his
cheek
passively
to
meet
her
entreating
kisses
,
and
there
gathered
a
moisture
in
his
eyes
,
which
he
just
rubbed
away
with
his
hand
.
<EOS>
The
action
seemed
to
rouse
him
,
for
he
shook
himself
and
said
:
"
I
shall
go
home
,
with
you
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
Did
n't
my
father
say
I
was
to
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
Tom
,
father
did
n't
wish
it
,
"
said
Maggie
,
her
anxiety
about
_
his
_
feeling
helping
her
to
master
her
agitation
.
<EOS>
What
_
would
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
he
do
when
she
told
him
all
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
mother
wants
you
to
come
,
 
poor
mother
!
 
<EOS>
she
cries
so
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Tom
,
it
's
very
dreadful
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
lips
grew
whiter
,
and
she
began
to
tremble
almost
as
Tom
had
done
.
<EOS>
The
two
poor
things
clung
closer
to
each
other
,
both
trembling
,
 
the
one
at
an
unshapen
fear
,
the
other
at
the
image
of
a
terrible
certainty
.
<EOS>
When
Maggie
spoke
,
it
was
hardly
above
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
 
and
 
poor
father
   
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
could
not
utter
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
suspense
was
intolerable
to
Tom
.
<EOS>
A
vague
idea
of
going
to
prison
,
as
a
consequence
of
debt
,
was
the
shape
his
fears
had
begun
to
take
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
's
my
father
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
impatiently
.
"
<EOS>
_
Tell
_
me
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
at
home
,
"
said
Maggie
,
finding
it
easier
to
reply
to
that
question
.
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
she
added
,
after
a
pause
,
"
not
himself
 
<EOS>
he
fell
off
his
horse
.
<EOS>
He
has
known
nobody
but
me
ever
since
 
he
seems
to
have
lost
his
senses
.
<EOS>
O
father
,
father
   
"
  
With
these
last
words
,
Maggie
's
sobs
burst
forth
with
the
more
violence
for
the
previous
struggle
against
them
.
<EOS>
Tom
felt
that
pressure
of
the
heart
which
forbids
tears
;
he
had
no
distinct
vision
of
their
troubles
as
Maggie
had
,
who
had
been
at
home
;
he
only
felt
the
crushing
weight
of
what
seemed
unmitigated
misfortune
.
<EOS>
He
tightened
his
arm
almost
convulsively
round
Maggie
as
she
sobbed
,
but
his
face
looked
rigid
and
tearless
,
his
eyes
blank
,
 
as
if
a
black
curtain
of
cloud
had
suddenly
fallen
on
his
path
.
  
<EOS>
But
Maggie
soon
checked
herself
abruptly
;
a
single
thought
had
acted
on
her
like
a
startling
sound
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
set
out
,
Tom
,
we
must
not
stay
.
<EOS>
Father
will
miss
me
;
we
must
be
at
the
turnpike
at
ten
to
meet
the
coach
.
"
<EOS>
She
said
this
with
hasty
decision
,
rubbing
her
eyes
,
and
rising
to
seize
her
bonnet
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
at
once
felt
the
same
impulse
,
and
rose
too
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wait
a
minute
,
Maggie
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
speak
to
Mr.
Stelling
,
and
then
we
'll
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
thought
he
must
go
to
the
study
where
the
pupils
were
;
but
on
his
way
he
met
Mr.
Stelling
,
who
had
heard
from
his
wife
that
Maggie
appeared
to
be
in
trouble
when
she
asked
for
her
brother
,
and
now
that
he
thought
the
brother
and
sister
had
been
alone
long
enough
,
was
coming
to
inquire
and
offer
his
sympathy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Please
,
sir
,
I
must
go
home
,
"
<EOS>
Tom
said
abruptly
,
as
he
met
Mr.
Stelling
in
the
passage
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
back
with
my
sister
directly
.
<EOS>
My
father
's
lost
his
lawsuit
 
<EOS>
he
's
lost
all
his
property
 
<EOS>
and
he
's
very
ill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
felt
like
a
kind
-
hearted
man
;
he
foresaw
a
probable
money
loss
for
himself
,
but
this
had
no
appreciable
share
in
his
feeling
,
while
he
looked
with
grave
pity
at
the
brother
and
sister
for
whom
youth
and
sorrow
had
begun
together
.
<EOS>
When
he
knew
how
Maggie
had
come
,
and
how
eager
she
was
to
get
home
again
,
he
hurried
their
departure
,
only
whispering
something
to
Mrs.
Stelling
,
who
had
followed
him
,
and
who
immediately
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
and
Maggie
were
standing
on
the
door
-
step
,
ready
to
set
out
,
when
Mrs.
Stelling
came
with
a
little
basket
,
which
she
hung
on
Maggie
's
arm
,
saying
:
"
Do
remember
to
eat
something
on
the
way
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
Maggie
's
heart
went
out
toward
this
woman
whom
she
had
never
liked
,
and
she
kissed
her
silently
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
sign
within
the
poor
child
of
that
new
sense
which
is
the
gift
of
sorrow
,
 
that
susceptibility
to
the
bare
offices
of
humanity
which
raises
them
into
a
bond
of
loving
fellowship
,
as
to
haggard
men
among
the
ice
-
bergs
the
mere
presence
of
an
ordinary
comrade
stirs
the
deep
fountains
of
affection
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
put
his
hand
on
Tom
's
shoulder
and
said
:
"
God
bless
you
,
my
boy
;
let
me
know
how
you
get
on
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
pressed
Maggie
's
hand
;
but
there
were
no
audible
good
-
byes
.
<EOS>
Tom
had
so
often
thought
how
joyful
he
should
be
the
day
he
left
school
"
for
good
"
!
<EOS>
And
now
his
school
years
seemed
like
a
holiday
that
had
come
to
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
slight
youthful
figures
soon
grew
indistinct
on
the
distant
road
,
 
were
soon
lost
behind
the
projecting
hedgerow
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
gone
forth
together
into
their
life
of
sorrow
,
and
they
would
never
more
see
the
sunshine
undimmed
by
remembered
cares
.
<EOS>
They
had
entered
the
thorny
wilderness
,
and
the
golden
gates
of
their
childhood
had
forever
closed
behind
them
.
    
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
The
Downfall
_
  
<EOS>
What
Had
Happened
at
Home
  
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Tulliver
first
knew
the
fact
that
the
law
-
suit
was
decided
against
him
,
and
that
Pivart
and
Wakem
were
triumphant
,
every
one
who
happened
to
observe
him
at
the
time
thought
that
,
for
so
confident
and
hot
-
tempered
a
man
,
he
bore
the
blow
remarkably
well
.
<EOS>
He
thought
so
himself
;
he
thought
he
was
going
to
show
that
if
Wakem
or
anybody
else
considered
him
crushed
,
they
would
find
themselves
mistaken
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
refuse
to
see
that
the
costs
of
this
protracted
suit
would
take
more
than
he
possessed
to
pay
them
;
but
he
appeared
to
himself
to
be
full
of
expedients
by
which
he
could
ward
off
any
results
but
such
as
were
tolerable
,
and
could
avoid
the
appearance
of
breaking
down
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
All
the
obstinacy
and
defiance
of
his
nature
,
driven
out
of
their
old
channel
,
found
a
vent
for
themselves
in
the
immediate
formation
of
plans
by
which
he
would
meet
his
difficulties
,
and
remain
Mr.
Tulliver
of
Dorlcote
Mill
in
spite
of
them
.
<EOS>
There
was
such
a
rush
of
projects
in
his
brain
,
that
it
was
no
wonder
his
face
was
flushed
when
he
came
away
from
his
talk
with
his
attorney
,
Mr.
Gore
,
and
mounted
his
horse
to
ride
home
from
Lindum
.
<EOS>
There
was
Furley
,
who
held
the
mortgage
on
the
land
,
 
a
reasonable
fellow
,
who
would
see
his
own
interest
,
Mr.
Tulliver
was
convinced
,
and
who
would
be
glad
not
only
to
purchase
the
whole
estate
,
including
the
mill
and
homestead
,
but
would
accept
Mr.
Tulliver
as
tenant
,
and
be
willing
to
advance
money
to
be
repaid
with
high
interest
out
of
the
profits
of
the
business
,
which
would
be
made
over
to
him
,
Mr.
Tulliver
only
taking
enough
barely
to
maintain
himself
and
his
family
.
<EOS>
Who
would
neglect
such
a
profitable
investment
?
<EOS>
Certainly
not
Furley
,
for
Mr.
Tulliver
had
determined
that
Furley
should
meet
his
plans
with
the
utmost
alacrity
;
and
there
are
men
whoses
brains
have
not
yet
been
dangerously
heated
by
the
loss
of
a
lawsuit
,
who
are
apt
to
see
in
their
own
interest
or
desires
a
motive
for
other
men
's
actions
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
doubt
(
in
the
miller
's
mind
)
<EOS>
that
Furley
would
do
just
what
was
desirable
;
and
if
he
did
 
why
,
things
would
not
be
so
very
much
worse
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
and
his
family
must
live
more
meagrely
and
humbly
,
but
it
would
only
be
till
the
profits
of
the
business
had
paid
off
Furley
's
advances
,
and
that
might
be
while
Mr.
Tulliver
had
still
a
good
many
years
of
life
before
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
clear
that
the
costs
of
the
suit
could
be
paid
without
his
being
obliged
to
turn
out
of
his
old
place
,
and
look
like
a
ruined
man
.
<EOS>
It
was
certainly
an
awkward
moment
in
his
affairs
.
<EOS>
There
was
that
suretyship
for
poor
Riley
,
who
had
died
suddenly
last
April
,
and
left
his
friend
saddled
with
a
debt
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
,
 
a
fact
which
had
helped
to
make
Mr.
Tulliver
's
banking
book
less
pleasant
reading
than
a
man
might
desire
toward
Christmas
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
he
had
never
been
one
of
those
poor
-
spirited
sneaks
who
would
refuse
to
give
a
helping
hand
to
a
fellow
-
traveller
in
this
puzzling
world
.
<EOS>
The
really
vexatious
business
was
the
fact
that
some
months
ago
the
creditor
who
had
lent
him
the
five
hundred
pounds
to
repay
Mrs.
Glegg
had
become
uneasy
about
his
money
(
set
on
by
Wakem
,
of
course
)
,
and
Mr.
Tulliver
,
still
confident
that
he
should
gain
his
suit
,
and
finding
it
eminently
inconvenient
to
raise
the
said
sum
until
that
desirable
issue
had
taken
place
,
had
rashly
acceded
to
the
demand
that
he
should
give
a
bill
of
sale
on
his
household
furniture
and
some
other
effects
,
as
security
in
lieu
of
the
bond
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
one
,
he
had
said
to
himself
;
he
should
soon
pay
off
the
money
,
and
there
was
no
harm
in
giving
that
security
any
more
than
another
.
<EOS>
But
now
the
consequences
of
this
bill
of
sale
occurred
to
him
in
a
new
light
,
and
he
remembered
that
the
time
was
close
at
hand
when
it
would
be
enforced
unless
the
money
were
repaid
.
<EOS>
Two
months
ago
he
would
have
declared
stoutly
that
he
would
never
be
beholden
to
his
wife
's
friends
;
but
now
he
told
himself
as
stoutly
that
it
was
nothing
but
right
and
natural
<EOS>
that
Bessy
should
go
to
the
Pullets
and
explain
the
thing
to
them
<EOS>
;
they
would
hardly
let
Bessy
's
furniture
be
sold
,
and
it
might
be
security
to
Pullet
if
he
advanced
the
money
,
 
there
would
,
after
all
,
be
no
gift
or
favor
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
would
never
have
asked
for
anything
from
so
poor
-
spirited
a
fellow
for
himself
,
but
Bessy
might
do
so
if
she
liked
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
precisely
the
proudest
and
most
obstinate
men
who
are
the
most
liable
to
shift
their
position
and
contradict
themselves
in
this
sudden
manner
;
everything
is
easier
to
them
than
to
face
the
simple
fact
that
they
have
been
thoroughly
defeated
,
and
must
begin
life
anew
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Tulliver
,
you
perceive
,
though
nothing
more
than
a
superior
miller
and
maltster
,
was
as
proud
and
obstinate
as
if
he
had
been
a
very
lofty
personage
,
in
whom
such
dispositions
might
be
a
source
of
that
conspicuous
,
far
-
echoing
tragedy
,
which
sweeps
the
stage
in
regal
robes
,
and
makes
the
dullest
chronicler
sublime
.
<EOS>
The
pride
and
obstinacy
of
millers
and
other
insignificant
people
,
whom
you
pass
unnoticingly
on
the
road
every
day
,
have
their
tragedy
too
;
but
it
is
of
that
unwept
,
hidden
sort
that
goes
on
from
generation
to
generation
,
and
leaves
no
record
,
 
such
tragedy
,
perhaps
,
as
lies
in
the
conflicts
of
young
souls
,
hungry
for
joy
,
under
a
lot
made
suddenly
hard
to
them
,
under
the
dreariness
of
a
home
where
the
morning
brings
no
promise
with
it
,
and
where
the
unexpectant
discontent
of
worn
and
disappointed
parents
weighs
on
the
children
like
a
damp
,
thick
air
,
in
which
all
the
functions
of
life
are
depressed
;
or
such
tragedy
as
lies
in
the
slow
or
sudden
death
that
follows
on
a
bruised
passion
,
though
it
may
be
a
death
that
finds
only
a
parish
funeral
.
<EOS>
There
are
certain
animals
to
which
tenacity
of
position
is
a
law
of
life
,
 
they
can
never
flourish
again
,
after
a
single
wrench
:
and
there
are
certain
human
beings
to
whom
predominance
is
a
law
of
life
,
 
<EOS>
they
can
only
sustain
humiliation
so
long
as
they
can
refuse
to
believe
in
it
,
and
,
in
their
own
conception
,
predominate
still
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
was
still
predominating
,
in
his
own
imagination
,
as
he
approached
St.
Ogg
's
,
through
which
he
had
to
pass
on
his
way
homeward
.
<EOS>
But
what
was
it
that
suggested
to
him
,
as
he
saw
the
Laceham
coach
entering
the
town
,
to
follow
it
to
the
coach
-
office
,
and
get
the
clerk
there
to
write
a
letter
,
requiring
Maggie
to
come
home
the
very
next
day
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
's
own
hand
shook
too
much
under
his
excitement
for
him
to
write
himself
,
and
he
wanted
the
letter
to
be
given
to
the
coachman
to
deliver
at
Miss
Firniss
's
school
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
craving
which
he
would
not
account
for
to
himself
,
to
have
Maggie
near
him
,
without
delay
,
 
she
must
come
back
by
the
coach
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
To
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
when
he
got
home
,
he
would
admit
no
difficulties
,
and
scolded
down
her
burst
of
grief
on
hearing
that
the
lawsuit
was
lost
,
by
angry
assertions
that
there
was
nothing
to
grieve
about
.
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
to
her
that
night
about
the
bill
of
sale
and
the
application
to
Mrs.
Pullet
,
for
he
had
kept
her
in
ignorance
of
the
nature
of
that
transaction
,
and
had
explained
the
necessity
for
taking
an
inventory
of
the
goods
as
a
matter
connected
with
his
will
.
<EOS>
The
possession
of
a
wife
conspicuously
one
's
inferior
in
intellect
is
,
like
other
high
privileges
,
attended
with
a
few
inconveniences
,
and
,
among
the
rest
,
with
the
occasional
necessity
for
using
a
little
deception
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
Mr.
Tulliver
was
again
on
horseback
in
the
afternoon
,
on
his
way
to
Mr.
Gore
's
office
at
St.
Ogg
's
.
<EOS>
Gore
was
to
have
seen
Furley
in
the
morning
,
and
to
have
sounded
him
in
relation
to
Mr.
Tulliver
's
affairs
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
not
gone
half
-
way
when
he
met
a
clerk
from
Mr.
Gore
's
office
,
who
was
bringing
a
letter
to
Mr.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gore
had
been
prevented
by
a
sudden
call
of
business
from
waiting
at
his
office
to
see
Mr.
Tulliver
,
according
to
appointment
,
but
would
be
at
his
office
at
eleven
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
meanwhile
had
sent
some
important
information
by
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
taking
the
letter
,
but
not
opening
it
.
"
<EOS>
Then
tell
Gore
I
'll
see
him
to
-
morrow
at
eleven
"
;
and
he
turned
his
horse
.
  
<EOS>
The
clerk
,
struck
with
Mr.
Tulliver
's
glistening
,
excited
glance
,
looked
after
him
for
a
few
moments
,
and
then
rode
away
.
<EOS>
The
reading
of
a
letter
was
not
the
affair
of
an
instant
to
Mr.
Tulliver
;
he
took
in
the
sense
of
a
statement
very
slowly
through
the
medium
of
written
or
even
printed
characters
;
so
he
had
put
the
letter
in
his
pocket
,
thinking
he
would
open
it
in
his
armchair
at
home
.
<EOS>
But
by
-
and
-
by
it
occurred
to
him
that
there
might
be
something
in
the
letter
Mrs.
Tulliver
must
not
know
about
,
and
if
so
,
it
would
be
better
to
keep
it
out
of
her
sight
altogether
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
his
horse
,
took
out
the
letter
,
and
read
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
a
short
letter
;
the
substance
was
,
that
Mr.
Gore
had
ascertained
,
on
secret
,
but
sure
authority
,
that
Furley
had
been
lately
much
straitened
for
money
,
and
had
parted
with
his
securities
,
 
among
the
rest
,
the
mortgage
on
Mr.
Tulliver
's
property
,
which
he
had
transferred
to
   
Wakem
.
  
<EOS>
In
half
an
hour
after
this
Mr.
Tulliver
's
own
wagoner
found
him
lying
by
the
roadside
insensible
,
with
an
open
letter
near
him
,
and
his
gray
horse
snuffing
uneasily
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
When
Maggie
reached
home
that
evening
,
in
obedience
to
her
father
's
call
,
he
was
no
longer
insensible
.
<EOS>
About
an
hour
before
he
had
become
conscious
,
and
after
vague
,
vacant
looks
around
him
,
had
muttered
something
about
"
a
letter
,
"
which
he
presently
repeated
impatiently
.
<EOS>
At
the
instance
of
Mr.
Turnbull
,
the
medical
man
,
Gore
's
letter
was
brought
and
laid
on
the
bed
,
and
the
previous
impatience
seemed
to
be
allayed
.
<EOS>
The
stricken
man
lay
for
some
time
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
letter
,
as
if
he
were
trying
to
knit
up
his
thoughts
by
its
help
.
<EOS>
But
presently
a
new
wave
of
memory
seemed
to
have
come
and
swept
the
other
away
;
he
turned
his
eyes
from
the
letter
to
the
door
,
and
after
looking
uneasily
,
as
if
striving
to
see
something
his
eyes
were
too
dim
for
,
he
said
,
"
The
little
wench
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
repeated
the
words
impatiently
from
time
to
time
,
appearing
entirely
unconscious
of
everything
except
this
one
importunate
want
,
and
giving
no
sign
of
knowing
his
wife
or
any
one
else
;
and
poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
her
feeble
faculties
almost
paralyzed
by
this
sudden
accumulation
of
troubles
,
went
backward
and
forward
to
the
gate
to
see
if
the
Laceham
coach
were
coming
,
though
it
was
not
yet
time
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
came
at
last
,
and
set
down
the
poor
anxious
girl
,
no
longer
the
"
little
wench
,
"
except
to
her
father
's
fond
memory
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
mother
,
what
is
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
Maggie
said
,
with
pale
lips
,
as
her
mother
came
toward
her
crying
.
<EOS>
She
did
n't
think
her
father
was
ill
,
because
the
letter
had
come
at
his
dictation
from
the
office
at
St.
Ogg
's
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Turnbull
came
now
to
meet
her
;
a
medical
man
is
the
good
angel
of
the
troubled
house
,
and
Maggie
ran
toward
the
kind
old
friend
,
whom
she
remembered
as
long
as
she
could
remember
anything
,
with
a
trembling
,
questioning
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
alarm
yourself
too
much
,
my
dear
,
"
he
said
,
taking
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Your
father
has
had
a
sudden
attack
,
and
has
not
quite
recovered
his
memory
.
<EOS>
But
he
has
been
asking
for
you
,
and
it
will
do
him
good
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
Keep
as
quiet
as
you
can
;
take
off
your
things
,
and
come
upstairs
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
obeyed
,
with
that
terrible
beating
of
the
heart
which
makes
existence
seem
simply
a
painful
pulsation
.
<EOS>
The
very
quietness
with
which
Mr.
Turnbull
spoke
had
frightened
her
susceptible
imagination
.
<EOS>
Her
father
's
eyes
were
still
turned
uneasily
toward
the
door
when
she
entered
and
met
the
strange
,
yearning
,
helpless
look
that
had
been
seeking
her
in
vain
.
<EOS>
With
a
sudden
flash
and
movement
,
he
raised
himself
in
the
bed
;
she
rushed
toward
him
,
and
clasped
him
with
agonized
kisses
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
child
!
<EOS>
it
was
very
early
for
her
to
know
one
of
those
supreme
moments
in
life
when
all
we
have
hoped
or
delighted
in
,
all
we
can
dread
or
endure
,
falls
away
from
our
regard
as
insignificant
;
is
lost
,
like
a
trivial
memory
,
in
that
simple
,
primitive
love
which
knits
us
to
the
beings
who
have
been
nearest
to
us
,
in
their
times
of
helplessness
or
of
anguish
.
  
<EOS>
But
that
flash
of
recognition
had
been
too
great
a
strain
on
the
father
's
bruised
,
enfeebled
powers
.
<EOS>
He
sank
back
again
in
renewed
insensibility
and
rigidity
,
which
lasted
for
many
hours
,
and
was
only
broken
by
a
flickering
return
of
consciousness
,
in
which
he
took
passively
everything
that
was
given
to
him
,
and
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
infantine
satisfaction
in
Maggie
's
near
presence
,
 
such
satisfaction
as
a
baby
has
when
it
is
returned
to
the
nurse
's
lap
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
sent
for
her
sisters
,
and
there
was
much
wailing
and
lifting
up
of
hands
below
stairs
.
<EOS>
Both
uncles
and
aunts
saw
that
the
ruin
of
Bessy
and
her
family
was
as
complete
as
they
had
ever
foreboded
it
,
and
there
was
a
general
family
sense
that
a
judgment
had
fallen
on
Mr.
Tulliver
,
which
it
would
be
an
impiety
to
counteract
by
too
much
kindness
.
<EOS>
But
Maggie
heard
little
of
this
,
scarcely
ever
leaving
her
father
's
bedside
,
where
she
sat
opposite
him
with
her
hand
on
his
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
wanted
to
have
Tom
fetched
home
,
and
seemed
to
be
thinking
more
of
her
boy
even
than
of
her
husband
;
but
the
aunts
and
uncles
opposed
this
.
<EOS>
Tom
was
better
at
school
,
since
Mr.
Turnbull
said
there
was
no
immediate
danger
,
he
believed
.
<EOS>
But
at
the
end
of
the
second
day
,
when
Maggie
had
become
more
accustomed
to
her
father
's
fits
of
insensibility
,
and
to
the
expectation
that
he
would
revive
from
them
,
the
thought
of
Tom
had
become
urgent
with
_
<EOS>
her
_
too
;
and
when
her
mother
sate
crying
at
night
and
saying
,
"
My
poor
lad
 
<EOS>
it
's
nothing
<EOS>
but
right
he
should
come
home
<EOS>
,
"
Maggie
said
,
"
Let
me
go
for
him
,
and
tell
him
,
mother
;
I
'll
go
to
-
morrow
morning
if
father
does
n't
know
me
and
want
me
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
so
hard
for
Tom
to
come
home
and
not
know
anything
about
it
beforehand
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
the
next
morning
Maggie
went
,
as
we
have
seen
.
<EOS>
Sitting
on
the
coach
on
their
way
home
,
the
brother
and
sister
talked
to
each
other
in
sad
,
interrupted
whispers
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
say
Mr.
Wakem
has
got
a
mortgage
or
something
on
the
land
,
Tom
,
"
said
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
the
letter
with
that
news
in
it
that
made
father
ill
,
they
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
that
scoundrel
's
been
planning
all
along
to
ruin
my
father
,
"
said
Tom
,
leaping
from
the
vaguest
impressions
to
a
definite
conclusion
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
make
him
feel
for
it
when
I
'm
a
man
.
<EOS>
Mind
<EOS>
you
never
speak
to
Philip
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Tom
!
"
said
Maggie
,
in
a
tone
of
sad
remonstrance
;
but
she
had
no
spirit
to
dispute
anything
then
,
still
less
to
vex
Tom
by
opposing
him
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
Teraphim
,
or
Household
Gods
  
<EOS>
When
the
coach
set
down
Tom
and
Maggie
,
it
was
five
hours
since
she
had
started
from
home
,
and
she
was
thinking
with
some
trembling
that
her
father
had
perhaps
missed
her
,
and
asked
for
"
the
little
wench
"
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
thought
of
no
other
change
that
might
have
happened
.
  
<EOS>
She
hurried
along
the
gravel
-
walk
and
entered
the
house
before
Tom
;
but
in
the
entrance
she
was
startled
by
a
strong
smell
of
tobacco
.
<EOS>
The
parlor
door
was
ajar
;
that
was
where
the
smell
came
from
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
strange
;
could
any
visitor
be
smoking
at
a
time
like
this
?
<EOS>
Was
her
mother
there
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
she
must
be
told
that
Tom
was
come
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
after
this
pause
of
surprise
,
was
only
in
the
act
of
opening
the
door
when
Tom
came
up
,
and
they
both
looked
into
the
parlor
together
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
coarse
,
dingy
man
,
of
whose
face
<EOS>
Tom
had
some
vague
recollection
,
sitting
in
his
father
's
chair
,
smoking
,
with
a
jug
and
glass
beside
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
truth
flashed
on
Tom
's
mind
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
To
"
have
the
bailiff
in
the
house
,
"
and
"
to
be
sold
up
,
"
were
phrases
which
he
had
been
used
to
,
even
as
a
little
boy
;
they
were
part
of
the
disgrace
and
misery
of
"
failing
,
"
of
losing
all
one
's
money
,
and
being
ruined
,
 
sinking
into
the
condition
of
poor
working
people
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
only
natural
this
should
happen
,
since
his
father
had
lost
all
his
property
,
and
he
thought
of
no
more
special
cause
for
this
particular
form
of
misfortune
than
the
loss
of
the
lawsuit
.
<EOS>
But
the
immediate
presence
of
this
disgrace
was
so
much
keener
an
experience
to
Tom
than
the
worst
form
of
apprehension
,
that
he
felt
at
this
moment
as
if
his
real
trouble
had
only
just
begin
;
it
was
a
touch
on
the
irritated
nerve
compared
with
its
spontaneous
dull
aching
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
sir
?
"
said
the
man
,
taking
the
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
,
with
rough
,
embarrassed
civility
.
<EOS>
The
two
young
startled
faces
made
him
a
little
uncomfortable
.
  
<EOS>
But
Tom
turned
away
hastily
without
speaking
;
the
sight
was
too
hateful
.
<EOS>
Maggie
had
not
understood
the
appearance
of
this
stranger
,
as
Tom
had
.
<EOS>
She
followed
him
,
whispering
:
"
Who
can
it
be
,
Tom
?
<EOS>
What
is
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
Then
,
with
a
sudden
undefined
dread
lest
this
stranger
might
have
something
to
do
with
a
change
in
her
father
,
she
rushed
upstairs
,
checking
herself
at
the
bedroom
door
to
throw
off
her
bonnet
,
and
enter
on
tiptoe
.
<EOS>
All
was
silent
there
;
her
father
was
lying
,
heedless
of
everything
around
him
,
with
his
eyes
closed
as
when
she
had
left
him
.
<EOS>
A
servant
was
there
,
but
not
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
's
my
mother
?
<EOS>
"
she
whispered
.
<EOS>
The
servant
did
not
know
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
hastened
out
,
and
said
to
Tom
;
"
Father
is
lying
quiet
;
let
us
go
and
look
for
my
mother
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
where
she
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
not
downstairs
,
not
in
any
of
the
bedrooms
.
<EOS>
There
was
but
one
room
below
the
attic
which
Maggie
had
left
unsearched
;
it
was
the
storeroom
,
where
her
mother
kept
all
her
linen
and
all
the
precious
"
best
things
"
that
were
only
unwrapped
and
brought
out
on
special
occasions
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
,
preceding
Maggie
,
as
they
returned
along
the
passage
,
opened
the
door
of
this
room
,
and
immediately
said
,
"
Mother
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
seated
there
with
all
her
laid
-
up
treasures
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
linen
chests
was
open
;
the
silver
teapot
was
unwrapped
from
its
many
folds
of
paper
,
and
the
best
china
was
laid
out
on
the
top
of
the
closed
linen
-
chest
;
spoons
and
skewers
and
ladles
were
spread
in
rows
on
the
shelves
;
and
the
poor
woman
was
shaking
her
head
and
weeping
,
with
a
bitter
tension
of
the
mouth
,
over
the
mark
,
"
Elizabeth
Dodson
,
"
on
the
corner
of
some
tablecloths
she
held
in
her
lap
.
  
<EOS>
She
dropped
them
,
and
started
up
as
Tom
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
boy
,
my
boy
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
clasping
him
round
the
neck
.
"
<EOS>
To
think
as
I
should
live
to
see
this
day
!
<EOS>
We
're
ruined
 
everything
's
going
to
be
sold
up
 
to
think
as
your
father
should
ha
'
married
me
to
bring
me
to
this
!
<EOS>
We
've
got
nothing
 
<EOS>
we
shall
be
beggars
 
<EOS>
we
must
go
to
the
workhouse
   
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
kissed
him
,
then
seated
herself
again
,
and
took
another
tablecloth
on
her
lap
,
unfolding
it
a
little
way
to
look
at
the
pattern
,
while
the
children
stood
by
in
mute
wretchedness
,
their
minds
quite
filled
for
the
moment
with
the
words
"
beggars
"
and
"
workhouse
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
think
o
'
these
cloths
as
I
spun
myself
,
"
she
went
on
,
lifting
things
out
and
turning
them
over
with
an
excitement
all
the
more
strange
and
piteous
because
the
stout
blond
woman
was
usually
so
passive
,
 
if
she
had
been
ruffled
before
,
it
was
at
the
surface
merely
,
 
"
and
Job
Haxey
wove
'em
,
and
brought
the
piece
home
on
his
back
,
as
I
remember
standing
at
the
door
and
seeing
him
come
,
before
I
ever
thought
o
'
marrying
your
father
!
<EOS>
And
the
pattern
as
I
chose
myself
,
and
bleached
so
beautiful
,
and
I
marked
'em
<EOS>
so
as
nobody
ever
saw
such
marking
,
 
they
must
cut
the
cloth
to
get
it
out
,
for
it
's
a
particular
stitch
.
<EOS>
And
they
're
all
to
be
sold
,
and
go
into
strange
people
's
houses
,
and
perhaps
be
cut
with
the
knives
,
and
wore
out
before
I
'm
dead
.
<EOS>
You
'll
never
have
one
of
'em
,
my
boy
,
"
she
said
,
looking
up
at
Tom
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
meant
'em
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
you
to
have
all
o
'
this
pattern
.
<EOS>
Maggie
could
have
had
the
large
check
 
<EOS>
it
never
shows
so
well
when
the
dishes
are
on
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
was
touched
to
the
quick
,
but
there
was
an
angry
reaction
immediately
.
<EOS>
His
face
flushed
as
he
said
:
  
"
But
will
my
aunts
let
them
be
sold
,
mother
?
<EOS>
Do
they
know
about
it
?
<EOS>
They
'll
never
let
your
linen
go
,
will
they
?
<EOS>
Have
n't
you
sent
to
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
sent
Luke
<EOS>
directly
they
'd
put
the
bailies
in
,
and
your
aunt
Pullet
's
been
 
and
,
<EOS>
oh
dear
,
<EOS>
oh
dear
,
she
cries
so
and
says
your
father
's
disgraced
my
family
and
made
it
the
talk
<EOS>
o
'
the
country
;
and
she
'll
buy
the
spotted
cloths
for
herself
,
because
she
's
never
had
so
many
as
she
wanted
o
'
that
pattern
,
and
they
sha'n"t
go
to
strangers
,
but
she
's
got
more
checks
<EOS>
a'ready
<EOS>
nor
she
can
do
with
.
"
<EOS>
(
Here
Mrs.
Tulliver
began
to
lay
back
the
tablecloths
in
the
chest
,
folding
and
stroking
them
automatically
.
)
<EOS>
"
And
your
uncle
Glegg
's
been
too
,
and
he
says
things
must
be
bought
in
for
us
to
lie
down
on
,
but
he
must
talk
to
your
aunt
;
and
they
're
all
coming
to
consult
.
<EOS>
But
I
know
they
'll
none
of
'em
take
my
chany
,
"
she
added
,
turning
toward
the
cups
and
saucers
,
"
for
they
all
found
fault
with
'em
when
I
bought
'em
,
"
<EOS>
cause
o
'
the
small
gold
sprig
all
over
'em
,
between
the
flowers
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
none
of
'em
got
better
chany
,
not
even
your
aunt
Pullet
herself
;
and
I
bought
it
wi
'
my
own
money
as
I
'd
saved
ever
since
I
was
turned
fifteen
;
and
the
silver
teapot
,
too
,
 
your
father
never
paid
for
'em
.
<EOS>
And
to
think
as
he
should
ha
'
married
me
,
and
brought
me
to
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
burst
out
crying
afresh
,
and
she
sobbed
with
her
handkerchief
at
her
eyes
a
few
moments
,
but
then
removing
it
,
she
said
in
a
deprecating
way
,
still
half
sobbing
,
as
if
she
were
called
upon
to
speak
before
she
could
command
her
voice
,
    
"
<EOS>
And
I
_
did
_
say
to
him
times
and
times
,
"
Whativer
you
do
,
do
n't
go
to
law
,
"
and
<EOS>
what
more
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
've
had
to
sit
by
while
my
own
fortin
's
been
spent
,
and
what
should
ha
'
been
my
children
's
,
too
.
<EOS>
You
'll
have
niver
a
penny
,
my
boy
 
<EOS>
but
it
is
n't
your
poor
mother
's
fault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
put
out
one
arm
toward
Tom
,
looking
up
at
him
piteously
with
her
helpless
,
childish
blue
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
poor
lad
went
to
her
and
kissed
her
,
and
she
clung
to
him
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
Tom
thought
of
his
father
with
some
reproach
.
<EOS>
His
natural
inclination
to
blame
,
hitherto
kept
entirely
in
abeyance
toward
his
father
by
the
predisposition
to
think
him
always
right
,
simply
on
the
ground
that
he
was
Tom
Tulliver
's
father
,
was
turned
into
this
new
channel
by
his
mother
's
plaints
;
and
with
his
indignation
against
Wakem
there
began
to
mingle
some
indignation
of
another
sort
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
his
father
might
have
helped
bringing
them
all
down
in
the
world
,
and
making
people
talk
of
them
with
contempt
,
but
no
one
should
talk
long
of
Tom
Tulliver
with
contempt
.
  
<EOS>
The
natural
strength
and
firmness
of
his
nature
was
beginning
to
assert
itself
,
urged
by
the
double
stimulus
of
resentment
against
his
aunts
,
and
the
sense
that
he
must
behave
like
a
man
and
take
care
of
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
fret
,
mother
,
"
he
said
tenderly
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
soon
be
able
to
get
money
;
I
'll
get
a
situation
of
some
sort
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
,
my
boy
!
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
a
little
soothed
.
<EOS>
Then
,
looking
round
sadly
,
"
But
I
should
n't
ha
'
minded
so
much
if
we
could
ha
'
kept
the
things
wi
'
my
name
on
'
em
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
had
witnessed
this
scene
with
gathering
anger
.
<EOS>
The
implied
reproaches
against
her
father
 
her
father
,
who
was
lying
there
in
a
sort
of
living
death
 
neutralized
all
her
pity
for
griefs
about
tablecloths
and
china
;
and
her
anger
on
her
father
's
account
was
heightened
by
some
egoistic
resentment
at
Tom
's
silent
concurrence
with
her
mother
in
shutting
her
out
from
the
common
calamity
.
<EOS>
She
had
become
almost
indifferent
to
her
mother
's
habitual
depreciation
of
her
,
but
she
was
keenly
alive
to
any
sanction
of
it
,
however
passive
,
that
she
might
suspect
in
Tom
.
<EOS>
Poor
Maggie
was
by
no
means
made
up
of
unalloyed
devotedness
,
but
put
forth
large
claims
for
herself
where
she
loved
strongly
.
<EOS>
She
burst
out
at
last
in
an
agitated
,
almost
violent
tone
:
"
<EOS>
Mother
,
how
can
you
talk
so
;
as
if
you
cared
only
for
things
with
_
your
_
name
on
,
and
not
for
what
has
my
father
's
name
too
;
and
to
care
about
anything
but
dear
father
himself
!
 
<EOS>
when
he
's
lying
there
,
and
may
never
speak
to
us
again
.
<EOS>
Tom
,
you
ought
to
say
so
too
;
you
ought
not
to
let
any
one
find
fault
with
my
father
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
,
almost
choked
with
mingled
grief
and
anger
,
left
the
room
,
and
took
her
old
place
on
her
father
's
bed
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
went
out
to
him
with
a
stronger
movement
than
ever
,
at
the
thought
that
people
would
blame
him
.
<EOS>
Maggie
hated
blame
;
she
had
been
blamed
all
her
life
,
and
nothing
had
come
of
it
but
evil
tempers
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
had
always
defended
and
excused
her
,
and
her
loving
remembrance
of
his
tenderness
was
a
force
within
her
that
would
enable
her
to
do
or
bear
anything
for
his
sake
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
was
a
little
shocked
at
Maggie
's
outburst
,
 
telling
_
him
_
as
well
as
his
mother
<EOS>
what
it
was
right

<EOS>
She
ought
to
have
learned
better
than
have
those
hectoring
,
assuming
manners
,
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
But
he
presently
went
into
his
father
's
room
,
and
the
sight
there
touched
him
in
a
way
that
effaced
the
slighter
impressions
of
the
previous
hour
.
<EOS>
When
Maggie
saw
how
he
was
moved
,
she
went
to
him
and
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
as
he
sat
by
the
bed
,
and
the
two
children
forgot
everything
else
in
the
sense
that
they
had
one
father
and
one
sorrow
.

The
Family
Council
  
<EOS>
It
was
at
eleven
o'clock
the
next
morning
that
the
aunts
and
uncles
came
to
hold
their
consultation
.
<EOS>
The
fire
was
lighted
in
the
large
parlor
,
and
poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
with
a
confused
impression
that
it
was
a
great
occasion
,
like
a
funeral
,
unbagged
the
bell
-
rope
tassels
,
and
unpinned
the
curtains
,
adjusting
them
in
proper
folds
,
looking
round
and
shaking
her
head
sadly
at
the
polished
tops
and
legs
of
the
tables
,
which
sister
Pullet
herself
could
not
accuse
of
insufficient
brightness
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
was
not
coming
,
he
was
away
on
business
;
but
Mrs.
Deane
appeared
punctually
in
that
handsome
new
gig
with
the
head
to
it
,
and
the
livery
-
servant
driving
it
,
which
had
thrown
so
clear
a
light
on
several
traits
in
her
character
to
some
of
her
female
friends
in
St.
Ogg
's
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
had
been
advancing
in
the
world
as
rapidly
as
Mr.
Tulliver
had
been
going
down
in
it
;
and
in
Mrs.
Deane
's
house
the
Dodson
linen
and
plate
were
beginning
to
hold
quite
a
subordinate
position
,
as
a
mere
supplement
to
the
handsomer
articles
of
the
same
kind
,
purchased
in
recent
years
,
 
a
change
which
had
caused
an
occasional
coolness
in
the
sisterly
intercourse
between
her
and
Mrs.
Glegg
,
who
felt
that
Susan
was
getting
"
like
the
rest
,
"
and
there
would
soon
be
little
of
the
true
Dodson
spirit
surviving
except
in
herself
,
and
,
it
might
be
hoped
,
in
those
nephews
who
supported
the
Dodson
name
on
the
family
land
,
far
away
in
the
Wolds
.
  
<EOS>
People
who
live
at
a
distance
are
naturally
less
faulty
than
those
immediately
under
our
own
eyes
;
and
it
seems
superfluous
,
when
we
consider
the
remote
geographical
position
of
the
Ethiopians
,
and
how
very
little
the
Greeks
had
to
do
with
them
,
to
inquire
further
why
Homer
calls
them
"
blameless
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Deane
was
the
first
to
arrive
;
and
when
she
had
taken
her
seat
in
the
large
parlor
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
came
down
to
her
with
her
comely
face
a
little
distorted
,
nearly
as
it
would
have
been
if
she
had
been
crying
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
a
woman
who
could
shed
abundant
tears
,
except
in
moments
when
the
prospect
of
losing
her
furniture
became
unusually
vivid
,
but
she
felt
how
unfitting
it
was
to
be
quite
calm
under
present
circumstances
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sister
,
what
a
world
this
is
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
as
she
entered
;
"
what
trouble
,
oh
dear
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Deane
was
a
thin
-
lipped
woman
,
who
made
small
well
-
considered
speeches
on
peculiar
occasions
,
repeating
them
afterward
to
her
husband
,
and
asking
him
if
she
had
not
spoken
very
properly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sister
,
"
she
said
deliberately
,
"
this
is
a
changing
world
,
and
we
do
n't
know
to
-
day
what
may
happen
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
right
to
be
prepared
for
all
things
,
and
if
trouble
's
sent
,
to
remember
as
it
is
n't
sent
without
a
cause
.
<EOS>
I
'm
very
sorry
for
you
as
a
sister
,
and
if
the
doctor
orders
jelly
for
Mr.
Tulliver
,
I
hope
you
'll
let
me
know
.
<EOS>
I
'll
send
it
willingly
;
for
it
is
<EOS>
but
right
he
should
have
proper
attendance
while
he
's
ill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Susan
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
rather
faintly
,
withdrawing
her
fat
hand
from
her
sister
's
thin
one
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
there
's
been
no
talk
o
'
jelly
yet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
after
a
moment
's
pause
she
added
,
"
There
's
a
dozen
o
'
cut
jelly
-
glasses
upstairs
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
put
jelly
into
'em
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
voice
was
rather
agitated
as
she
uttered
the
last
words
,
but
the
sound
of
wheels
diverted
her
thoughts
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Glegg
were
come
,
and
were
almost
immediately
followed
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Pullet
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pullet
entered
crying
,
as
a
compendious
mode
,
at
all
times
,
of
expressing
what
were
her
views
of
life
in
general
,
and
what
,
in
brief
,
were
the
opinions
she
held
concerning
the
particular
case
before
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
had
on
her
fuzziest
front
,
and
garments
which
appeared
to
have
had
a
recent
resurrection
from
rather
a
creasy
form
of
burial
;
a
costume
selected
with
the
high
moral
purpose
of
instilling
perfect
humility
into
Bessy
and
her
children
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
G.
,
wo
n't
you
come
nearer
the
fire
?
"
said
her
husband
,
unwilling
to
take
the
more
comfortable
seat
without
offering
it
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
I
've
seated
myself
here
,
Mr.
Glegg
,
"
returned
this
superior
woman
;
"
_
you
_
can
roast
yourself
,
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
seating
himself
good
-
humoredly
,
"
and
how
's
the
poor
man
upstairs
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dr.
Turnbull
thought
him
a
deal
better
this
morning
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
;
"
he
took
more
notice
,
and
spoke
to
me
;
but
he
's
never
known
Tom
yet
,
 
looks
at
the
poor
lad
as
if
he
was
a
stranger
,
though
he
said
something
once
about
Tom
and
the
pony
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
says
his
memory
's
gone
a
long
way
back
,
and
he
does
n't
know
Tom
because
he
's
thinking
of
him
when
he
was
little
.
<EOS>
Eh
dear
,
eh
dear
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
it
's
the
water
got
on
his
brain
,
"
said
aunt
Pullet
,
turning
round
from
adjusting
her
cap
in
a
melancholy
way
at
the
pier
-
glass
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
much
if
he
ever
gets
up
again
;
and
if
he
does
,
he
'll
most
like
be
childish
,
as
Mr.
Carr
was
,
poor
man
!
<EOS>
They
fed
him
with
a
spoon
as
if
he
'd
been
a
babby
for
three
year
.
<EOS>
He
'd
quite
lost
the
use
of
his
limbs
;
but
then
he
'd
got
a
Bath
chair
,
and
somebody
to
draw
him
;
and
that
's
what
you
wo
n't
have
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
,
Bessy
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
Sister
Pullet
,
"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
severely
,
"
if
I
understand
right
,
we
've
come
together
this
morning
to
advise
and
consult
about
what
's
to
be
done
in
this
disgrace
as
has
fallen
upon
the
family
,
and
not
to
talk
o

people
as
do
n't
belong
to

<EOS>
Mr.

was
none

I
've
ever
heared

"
Sister
Glegg

"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
in
a
pleading
tone
,
drawing
on
her
gloves
again
,
and
stroking
the
fingers
in
an
agitated
manner
,
"
if
you
've
got
anything
disrespectful
to
say
o
'
<EOS>
Mr.
Carr
,
I
do
beg
of
you
as
you
wo
n't
say
it
to

.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
_
know
what
he
was
,
"
she
added
,
with
a
sigh
;
"
his
breath
was
short
to
that
degree
as
you
could
hear
him
two
rooms
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Sophy
!
"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
with
indignant
disgust
,
"
you

do
<EOS>
_
talk
o
'
<EOS>
people
's
complaints
<EOS>
till
it
's
quite
undecent

<EOS>
But
I
say
again
,
as
I
said
before
,
I
did
n't
come
away
from
home
to
talk
about
acquaintances
,
whether
they

short

If

do

save
a

shall
go
back

<EOS>
_
<EOS>
One
_
ca
n't
act
without
the
other
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
;
it
is
n't
to
be
expected
as
_
I
_
should
do
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well

Jane

"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
"
I
do
n't
see
as
you
've
been
so
very
forrard
at
doing
.
<EOS>
So
far
as
I
know
,
this
is
the
first
time
as
here
you
've
been
,
since
it
's
been
known
as
the
bailiff
's
in
the
house
;
and
I
was
here
yesterday
,
and
looked
at
all
Bessy
's
linen
and
things
,
and
I
told
her
I
'd
buy
in
the
spotted
tablecloths
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
speak
fairer
;
for
as
for
the
teapot
as
she
does
n't
want
to
go
out
<EOS>
o
'
the
family
<EOS>
,
it
stands
to
sense
I
ca
n't
do
with
two
silver
teapots
,
not
if
it
_
had
n't
_
a
straight
spout

but
the
spotted
damask
<EOS>
I
was
allays
fond
on

<EOS>
"
I
wish
it
could
be
managed
so
as
my
teapot

chany

the
best
castors
need
n't
be
put
up
for
sale

said
poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
beseechingly
,
"
and
the
sugar
-
tongs
the
first
things
ever
I
bought

"
But
that
ca
n't
be

you
know

said
Mr.
Glegg
.
<EOS>
"
If
one
o

the
family
chooses

buy

they
can

one
thing

be
bid
for
as
well

another

"
And
it
is
n't
to
be
looked
for
,
"
said
uncle
Pullet
,
with
unwonted
independence
of
idea
,
"
as
your
own
family
should
pay
more
for
things
nor
they
'll
fetch

They

old

by
auction

<EOS>
"
Oh

oh

"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
"
to
think
o
'
my
chany
being
sold
i

way

I

<EOS>
I
was
fond

and
there

never
been
a

I

there

the
roses

You

Well

I
've
no
objection
to
buy
some

said
Mrs.

rather
loftily

"
we
can
do
with
extra
things
in
our
house

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Best
things

"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Glegg
,
with
severity
,
which
had
gathered
intensity
from
her
long
silence
.
<EOS>
"
It
drives
me
past
patience
to
hear
you
all
talking

best

that

the
other

such
as
silver

You
must
bring
your
mind
to
your
circumstances

Bessy

not
be
thinking
o

silver

chany

whether
you

get
so
much
as
a
flock
-
bed
to
lie
on
,
and
a
blanket
to
cover
you

and
a
stool
to
sit
on

<EOS>
You
must
remember
,
if
you
get
'em
,
it
'll
be
because
your
friends
have
bought
'em
for
you
,
for
you
're
dependent
upon
_
them

for
everything

for
your
husband
lies
there
helpless

has
n't
got
a
penny
<EOS>
i

the
world
to
call
his
own

And
it
's
for
your
own
good
<EOS>
I
say
this
,
for
it
's
right
<EOS>
you
should
feel
what
your
state
is
,
and
what
disgrace
your
husband
's
brought
on
your

family
,
as
you

be
humble
in

Mrs.
Glegg
paused

for
speaking
with
much
energy

the
good

Mrs.

always
borne
down

predominance
of

who
had
made

wear
the
yoke
of
a

in
very
tender

said
pleadingly

<EOS>
"
I

I

buy

What

kindly
,
"

We
shall
make
a

among

buy
what
's
sufficient
for
you

though
,
as
Mrs.
G.
says
,
they
must
be
useful

plain
things

<EOS>
We
must

be
thinking

what
's
unnecessary

<EOS>
A

Why

I

the

known
myself

I

lain
on
sacking

the

<EOS>
We

a

useless

Mr.

Mrs.

I

it

fine
talking

you

Pray

<EOS>
You
must
go
to
the

if
they
did

<EOS>
And
you
ought
to
know
that
,
and
keep
it
in

and
ask
us
humble
to
do
what
we

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
talked
o

the
Mosses

and
what
Mr.
Tulliver
's
done
for

"
said
uncle
Pullet
,
who
became
unusually
suggestive
where
advances
of
money
were
concerned
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
n't
_
<EOS>
they
_
<EOS>
been

<EOS>
They
ought
to
do
something
as
well
as
other
folks

and
if

's
lent

money

they
ought

be
made

pay
it
back

<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
Mrs.
Deane
;
"
I
've
been
thinking
so
.
<EOS>
How
is
it
<EOS>
Mr.

Mrs.
Moss
are
n't
here

<EOS>
It

<EOS>

right
they

do
their

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear

"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
"
I
never
sent
'em
word
about
Mr.

and
they
live
so
back'ard
among

lanes
at
Basset
<EOS>
,
they
niver
hear
anything
only
when
Mr.
Moss
comes
to
market
.
<EOS>
But
I
niver
gave
'em
a
thought
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
Maggie
did
n't
,
though
,
for
she
was
allays
so
fond
of
her
aunt
Moss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why

n't
your
children
come
in

Bessy

"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
at
the
mention
of
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
They
should
hear
what
their
aunts

uncles
have
got
to
say
;
and
Maggie
,
 
when
it
's
me
as
have
paid
for
half
her
schooling
,
she
ought
to
think
more
of
her
aunt
Pullet
than
of
aunt
Moss
.
<EOS>
I
may
go
off
sudden
when
I
get
home
to

day

there
's
no
telling

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
'd
had
_
my
_
way
,
"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
"
the
children
'
ud
ha
'
been
in
the
room
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
It
's
time
they
knew
who
they
've
to
look
to
,
and
it
's
right
as
_
somebody
_
should
talk
to
'em
,
and
let
'em
know
their
condition
<EOS>
i
'
life
,
and
what
they
're
come
down
to
,
and
make
'em
feel
as
they
've
got
to
suffer
for
their
father
's
faults
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'll
go
and
fetch
'em
,
sister
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
resignedly
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
crushed
now
,
and
thought
of
the
treasures
in
the
storeroom
with
no
other
feeling
than
blank
despair
.
  
<EOS>
She
went
upstairs
to
fetch
Tom
and
Maggie
,
who
were
both
in
their
father
's
room
,
and
was
on
her
way
down
again
,
when
the
sight
of
the
storeroom
door
suggested
a
new
thought
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
went
toward
it
,
and
left
the
children
to
go
down
by
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
The
aunts
and
uncles
appeared
to
have
been
in
warm
discussion
when
the
brother
and
sister
entered
,
 
both
with
shrinking
reluctance
;
for
though
Tom
,
with
a
practical
sagacity
which
had
been
roused
into
activity
by
the
strong
stimulus
of
the
new
emotions
he
had
undergone
since
yesterday
,
had
been
turning
over
in
his
mind
a
plan
which
he
meant
to
propose
to
one
of
his
aunts
or
uncles
<EOS>
,
he
felt
by
no
means
amicably
toward
them
,
and
dreaded
meeting
them
all
at
once
as
he
would
have
dreaded
a
large
dose
of
concentrated
physic
,
which
was
but
just
endurable
in
small
draughts
.
<EOS>
As
for
Maggie
,
she
was
peculiarly
depressed
this
morning
;
she
had
been
called
up
,
after
brief
rest
,
at
three
o'clock
,
and
had
that
strange
dreamy
weariness
which
comes
from
watching
in
a
sick
-
room
through
the
chill
hours
of
early
twilight
and
breaking
day
,
 
in
which
the
outside
day
-
light
life
seems
to
have
no
importance
,
and
to
be
a
mere
margin
to
the
hours
in
the
darkened
chamber
.
<EOS>
Their
entrance
interrupted
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
The
shaking
of
hands
was
a
melancholy
and
silent
ceremony
,
till
uncle
Pullet
observed
,
as
Tom
approached
him
:
  
"
Well
,
young
sir
,
we
've
been
talking
as
we
should
want
your
pen
and
ink
;
you
can
write
rarely
now
,
after
all
your
schooling
,
I
should
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
"
said
uncle
Glegg
,
with
admonition
which
he
meant
to
be
kind
,
"
we
must
look
to
see
the
good
of
all
this
schooling
,
as
your
father
's
sunk
so
much
money
in
,
now
,
      
<EOS>
"
When
land
is
gone
and
money
's
spent
,
  
Then
learning
is
most
excellent
.
"
  
<EOS>
Now
's
the
time
<EOS>
,
Tom
,
to
let
us
see
the
good
o
'
your
learning
.
<EOS>
Let
us
see
whether
you
can
do
better
than
I
can
,
as
have
made
my
fortin
without
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
began
wi
'
doing
with
little
,
you
see
;
I
could
live
on
a
basin
o
'
porridge
and
a
crust
o
'
bread
-
and
-
cheese
.
<EOS>
But
I
doubt
high
living
and
high
learning
"
ull
make
it
harder
for
you
,
young
man
,
nor
it
was
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
must
do
it
,
"
interposed
aunt
Glegg
,
energetically
,
"
<EOS>
whether
it
's
hard
or
no
.
<EOS>
He
has
n't
got
to
consider
what
's
hard
;
he
must
consider
as
he
is
n't
to
trusten
to
his
friends
to
keep
him
in
idleness
and
luxury
;
he
's
got
to
bear
the
fruits
of
his
father
's
misconduct
,
and
bring
his
mind
to
fare
hard
and
to
work
hard
.
<EOS>
And
he
must
be
humble
and
grateful
to
his
aunts
and
uncles
for
what
they
're
doing
for
his
mother
and
father
,
as
must
be
turned
out
into
the
streets
and
go
to
the
workhouse
if
they
did
n't
help
'em
.
<EOS>
And
his
sister
,
too
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Glegg
,
looking
severely
at
Maggie
,
who
had
sat
down
on
the
sofa
by
her
aunt
Deane
,
drawn
to
her
by
the
sense
that
she
was
Lucy
's
mother
,
"
she
must
make
up
her
mind
to
be
humble
and
work
;
for
there
'll
be
no
servants
to
wait
on
her
any
more
,
 
she
must
remember
that
.
<EOS>
She
must
do
the
work
<EOS>
o
'
the
house
,
and
she
must
respect
and
love
her
aunts
as
have
done
so
much
for
her
,
and
saved
their
money
to
leave
to
their
nepheys
and
nieces
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
was
still
standing
before
the
table
in
the
centre
of
the
group
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
heightened
color
in
his
face
,
and
he
was
very
far
from
looking
humbled
,
but
he
was
preparing
to
say
,
in
a
respectful
tone
,
something
he
had
previously
meditated
,
when
the
door
opened
and
his
mother
re
-
entered
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
in
her
hands
a
small
tray
,
on
which
she
had
placed
her
silver
teapot
,
a
specimen
teacup
and
saucer
,
the
castors
,
and
sugar
-
tongs
.
  
<EOS>
"
See
here
,
sister
,
"
she
said
,
looking
at
Mrs.
Deane
,
as
she
set
the
tray
on
the
table
,
"
I
thought
,
<EOS>
perhaps
,
if
you
looked
at
the
teapot
again
,
 
it
's
a
good
while
since
you
saw
it
,
 
you
might
like
the
pattern
better
;
it
makes
beautiful
tea
,
and
there
's
a
stand
and
everything
;
you
might
use
it
for
every
day
,
or
else
lay
it
by
for
Lucy
when
she
goes
to
housekeeping
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
so
loath
for
'em
to
buy
it
at
the
Golden
Lion
,
"
said
the
poor
woman
,
her
heart
swelling
,
and
the
tears
coming
,
 
<EOS>
"
my
teapot
as
I
bought
when
I
was
married
,
and
to
think
of
its
being
scratched
,
and
set
before
the
travellers
and
folks
,
and
my
letters
on
it
,
 
see
here
,
E.
D.
,
 
and
everybody
to
see
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
dear
,
dear
!
"
said
aunt
Pullet
,
shaking
her
head
with
deep
sadness
<EOS>
,
"
it
's
very
bad
,
 
to
think
o
'
the
family
initials
going
about
everywhere
 
<EOS>
it
niver
was
so
before
;
you
're
a
very
unlucky
sister
,
Bessy
.
<EOS>
But
what
's
the
use
<EOS>
o
'
buying
the
teapot
,
when
there
's
the
linen
and
spoons
and
everything
to
go
,
and
some
of
'em
with
your
full
name
,
 
and
when
it
's
got
that
straight
spout
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
As
to
disgrace
o
'
the
family
,
"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
"
that
ca
n't
be
helped
wi
'
buying
teapots
.
<EOS>
The
disgrace
is
,
for
one
o
'
the
family
to
ha
'
married
a
man
as
has
brought
her
to
beggary
.
<EOS>
The
disgrace
is
,
as
they
're
to
be
sold
up
.
<EOS>
We
ca
n't
hinder
the
country
from
knowing
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
had
started
up
from
the
sofa
at
the
allusion
to
her
father
,
but
Tom
saw
her
action
and
flushed
face
in
time
to
prevent
her
from
speaking
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Be
quiet
,
Maggie
,
"
he
said
authoritatively
,
pushing
her
aside
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
remarkable
manifestation
of
self
-
command
and
practical
judgment
in
a
lad
of
fifteen
,
that
when
his
aunt
Glegg
ceased
,
he
began
to
speak
in
a
quiet
and
respectful
manner
,
though
with
a
good
deal
of
trembling
in
his
voice
;
for
his
mother
's
words
had
cut
him
to
the
quick
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
aunt
,
"
he
said
,
looking
straight
at
Mrs.
Glegg
,
"
if
you
think
it
's
a
disgrace
to
the
family
that
we
should
be
sold
up
,
would
n't
it
be
better
to
prevent
it
altogether
?
<EOS>
And
if
you
and
aunt
Pullet
,
"
he
continued
,
looking
at
the
latter
,
"
think
of
leaving
any
money
to
me
and
Maggie
,
would
n't
it
be
better
to
give
it
now
,
and
pay
the
debt
we
're
going
to
be
sold
up
for
,
and
save
my
mother
from
parting
with
her
furniture
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
silence
for
a
few
moments
,
for
every
one
,
including
Maggie
,
was
astonished
at
Tom
's
sudden
manliness
of
tone
.
<EOS>
Uncle
Glegg
was
the
first
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
young
man
,
come
now
!
<EOS>
You
show
some
notion
o
'
things
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
the
interest
,
you
must
remember
;
your
aunts
get
five
per
cent
on
their
money
,
and
they
'd
lose
that
if
they
advanced
it
;
you
have
n't
thought
o
'
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
work
and
pay
that
every
year
,
"
said
Tom
,
promptly
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
do
anything
to
save
my
mother
from
parting
with
her
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
done
!
"
said
uncle
Glegg
,
admiringly
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
drawing
Tom
out
,
rather
than
reflecting
on
the
practicability
of
his
proposal
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
produced
the
unfortunate
result
of
irritating
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr.
Glegg
!
<EOS>
"
said
that
lady
,
with
angry
sarcasm
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
pleasant
work
for
you
to
be
giving
my
money
away
,
as
you
've
pretended
to
leave
at
my
own
disposal
.
<EOS>
And
my
money
,
as
was
my
own
father
's
gift
,
and
not
yours
,
Mr.
Glegg
;
and
I
've
saved
it
,
and
added
to
it
myself
,
and
had
more
to
put
out
almost
every
year
,
and
it
's
to
go
and
be
sunk
in
other
folks
'
furniture
,
and
encourage
'em
in
luxury
and
extravagance
as
they
've
no
means
of
supporting
;
and
I
'm
to
alter
my
will
,
or
have
a
codicil
made
,
and
leave
two
or
three
hundred
less
behind
me
when
I
die

me
as
have
allays
done
right

been
careful

the

my
money

be
squandered
on

<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
for
Bessy
and
her
children
,
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
think
of
<EOS>
'em
o
'
nights
dreadful
,
for
I
sleep
very
bad
wi

this
new
medicine

but
<EOS>
it
's
no
use

me
to
think
o

doing
anything
,
if
you

meet
me
half
-
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
there
's
this
to
be
considered
,
"
said
Mr.
Glegg
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
use
to
pay
off
this
debt
and
save
the
furniture
,
when
there
's
all
the
law
debts
behind
,
as
'
ud
take
every
shilling
,
and
more
than
could
be
made
out
o
'
land
and
stock
,
for
I
've
made
that
out
from
Lawyer
Gore
.
<EOS>
We
'd
need
save
our
money
to
keep
the
poor
man
with
,
instead
o
'
spending
it
on
furniture
as
he
can
neither
eat
nor
drink
.
<EOS>
You
_
will
_
be
so
hasty
,
Jane
,
as
if
I
did
n't
know
what
was
reasonable
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
speak
accordingly
,
Mr.
Glegg
!
"
said
his
wife
,
with
slow
,
loud
emphasis
,
bending
her
head
toward
him
significantly
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
's
countenance
had
fallen
during
this
conversation
,
and
his
lip
quivered
;
but
he
was
determined
not
to
give
way
.
<EOS>
He
would
behave
like
a
man
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
on
the
contrary
,
after
her
momentary
delight
in
Tom
's
speech
,
had
relapsed
into
her
state
of
trembling
indignation
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
had
been
standing
close
by
Tom
's
side
,
and
had
been
clinging
to
his
arm
ever
since
he
had
last
spoken
;
Maggie
suddenly
started
up
and
stood
in
front
of
them
,
her
eyes
flashing
like
the
eyes
of
a
young
lioness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
come
,
then
,
"
she
burst
out
,
"
talking
and
interfering
with
us
and
scolding
us
,
if
you
do
n't
mean
to
do
anything
to
help
my
poor
mother
 
<EOS>
your
own
sister
,
 
if
you
've
no
feeling
for
her
when
she
's
in
trouble
,
and
wo
n't
part
with
anything
,
though
you
would
never
miss
it
,
to
save
her
from
pain
?
<EOS>
Keep
away
from
us
then
,
and
do
n't
come
to
find
fault
with
my
father
,
 
he
was
better
than
any
of
you

he
was
kind

he
would

you

,
if
you
had
been
in

<EOS>
Tom

I
do
n't
ever
want
to

any

your
money
,
if
you
wo

<EOS>
We
'd
rather
not

it
!
<EOS>
We
'll
do
without

"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
,
having
hurled
her
defiance
at
aunts
and
uncles
in
this
way
,
stood
still
,
with
her
large
dark
eyes
glaring
at
them
,
as
if
she
were
ready
to
await
all
consequences
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
frightened
;
there
was
something
portentous
in
this
mad
outbreak
;
she
did
not
see
how
life
could
go
on
after
it
.
<EOS>
Tom
was
vexed
;
it
was
no
_
use
_
to
talk
so
.
<EOS>
The
aunts
were
silent
with
surprise
for
some
moments
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
in
a
case
of
aberration
such
as
this
,
comment
presented
itself
as
more
expedient
than
any
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You

n't
seen
the
end
<EOS>
o

<EOS>
your
trouble

that
child

said
Mrs.
Pullet
;
"
she
's
beyond
everything
for
boldness
and
unthankfulness
.
<EOS>
It
's
dreadful
.
<EOS>
I
might
ha

let
alone
paying
for
her
schooling
,
for
she
's
worse
nor
ever

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
more
than
what
I
've

said
,
"
followed
Mrs.
Glegg
.
<EOS>
"
Other
folks
may
be
surprised
,
but
I
'm
not

<EOS>
I
've
said
over
and
over
again
,
 
<EOS>
years
ago
I
've
said
,
 
<EOS>
"
Mark
my
words

no
good

there
is
n't
a

"
<EOS>
And
as
for
her
having
so
much
schooling
,
I
never
thought
well
<EOS>
o
'
that
.
<EOS>
I
'd
my
reasons
when
I
said
_
<EOS>
I
_
would
n't
pay
anything
toward
it

<EOS>
"
  
"
Come

said
Mr.

,
"

"
  
<EOS>
While
Mr.
Glegg
was
speaking
,
a
tall
dark
figure
was
seen
hurrying
past
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
there
's
Mrs.
Moss
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
"
The
bad
news
must
ha
'
reached
her
,
then
"
;
and
she
went
out
to
open
the
door
,
Maggie
eagerly
following
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
fortunate
,
"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
.
<EOS>
"
She
can
agree
to
the
list
o
'
things
to
be
bought
in
.
<EOS>
It
's
but
<EOS>
right
she
should
do
her
share
when
it
's
her
own
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Moss
was
in
too
much
agitation
to
resist
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
movement
,
as
she
drew
her
into
the
parlor
automatically
,
without
reflecting
that
it
was
hardly
kind
to
take
her
among
so
many
persons
in
the
first
painful
moment
of
arrival
.
<EOS>
The
tall
,
worn
,
dark
-
haired
woman
was
a
strong
contrast
to
the
Dodson
sisters
as
she
entered
in
her
shabby
dress
,
with
her
shawl
and
bonnet
looking
as
if
they
had
been
hastily
huddled
on
,
and
with
that
entire
absence
of
self
-
consciousness
which
belongs
to
keenly
felt
trouble
.
<EOS>
Maggie
was
clinging
to
her
arm
;
and
Mrs.
Moss
seemed
to
notice
no
one
else
except
Tom
,
whom
she
went
straight
up
to
and
took
by
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
children
,
"
she
burst
out
,
"
<EOS>
you

no
call

<EOS>
them

How

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Turnbull
thinks
he
'll
get
better

Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
Sit

<EOS>
Do

<EOS>
"
Oh

said
Mrs.
Moss
,
allowing
Maggie
to
lead
her
to
the
sofa
,
but
still
not
seeming
to
notice
the
presence
of
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
We

three
hundred

yet
we

eight

the

And
I

But
I

I

"
  
<EOS>
The
poor
woman
was
interrupted
by
a
rising
sob
.
  
<EOS>
"
Three
hundred
pounds
!
<EOS>
oh
dear

dear

"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
who
,
when
she
had
said
that
her
husband
had
done
"
unknown
"
things
for
his
sister
,
had
not
had
any
particular
sum
in
her
mind

and
felt
a
wife
's
irritation
at
having
been
kept
in
the
dark
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
madness
,
to
be
sure
!
"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
man
with
a
family

<EOS>
He

no
right

that
way

without

I
'll
be
bound

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
's
voice
had
arrested
Mrs.
Moss
's
attention
,
and
looking
up
,
she
said
:
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
there
_
was
_
security
;
my
husband
gave
a
note
for
it

<EOS>
We

not

sort
<EOS>
o

people

neither

rob

children

and
we
looked
to
paying
back
the
money

when
the
times
got
a
bit
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well

but
now

"
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
gently
,
"
has
n't
your
husband
<EOS>
no
way

raising

Because
it

for

if
we
can
do
without
Tulliver

being
made
a
bankrupt

<EOS>
Your
husband
's
got
stock
;
it
is
<EOS>
but
right
he
should
raise
the
money

as
it
seems
to
me

what
I

Mrs.

<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sir
,
you
do
n't
know
what
bad
luck
my
husband

had
with
his
stock

<EOS>
The
farm
's
suffering
so
as
never
was
for
want
o
'
stock
;
and
we
've
sold
all
the
wheat

we
're
behind
with
our
rent

not
<EOS>
but
what
we

like
to
do
what
's
right

I

sit
up

work
half
the
night

<EOS>
if
it

be
any
good

but
there

them
poor

"
Do

aunt
<EOS>

do

whispered
Maggie
,
who
had
kept
hold
of
Mrs.
Moss
's
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
Mr.
Tulliver
let
you
have
the
money
all
at
once
?
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
still
lost
in
the
conception
of
things
which
had
been
"
going
on
"
without
her
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
"
No

at
twice

said
Mrs.

,
rubbing
her
eyes
and
making
an
effort
to
restrain
her
tears
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
last
was
after
my
bad
illness
four
years
ago
,
as
everything
went
wrong
,
and
there
was
a
new
note
made
then
.
<EOS>
What
with
illness
and
bad
luck
,
I
've
been
nothing
but
cumber
all
my
life

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mrs.
Moss
,
"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
with
decision
,
"
yours
is
a
very
unlucky
family

the
more
's
the
pity
for

sister

<EOS>
"
I
set
off
in
the
cart
as
soon
as

I
heard
o

happened

said
Mrs.
Moss
,
looking
at
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
"
I

never

<EOS>
And
it
is
n't
as
I
'm
thinking
all
about
ourselves

and
nothing
about
my
brother

only
the
money
was
so
on
my
mind

I
could
n't
help
speaking
about
it

<EOS>
And
my

me
desire
to
do
the
right

she
added
,
looking
at
Mr.

<EOS>
"
Why
,
there
's
this
to
be
thought
on
,
Mrs.
Moss
,
"
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
"
and
it
's
right
to
warn
you
,
 
if
Tulliver
's
made
a
bankrupt

and
he
's
got
a
note
-
of

hand
of
your

for

you

it

<EOS>
"
Oh
dear

oh
dear

"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
thinking
of
the
bankruptcy
,
and
not
of
Mrs.
Moss
's
concern
in
it
.
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Moss
herself
listened
in
trembling
submission
,
while
Maggie
looked
with
bewildered
distress
at
Tom
to
see
if
_
<EOS>
he
_
showed
any
signs
of
understanding
this
trouble
,
and
caring
about
poor
aunt
Moss
.
<EOS>
Tom
was
only
looking
thoughtful
,
with
his
eyes
on
the
tablecloth
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
he
is
n't
made
bankrupt
,
"
continued
Mr.
Glegg
,
"
as
I
said
before
,
three
hundred
pounds

be
a
little
fortin

<EOS>
We
do
n't
know
but
what
he
may
be
partly
helpless
,
if
he
ever
gets
up
again
.
<EOS>
I
'm
very
sorry
if
it
goes
hard
with
you
,
Mrs.
Moss
,
but
my
opinion
is
,
looking
at
it
one
way
,
it
'll
be
right
for
you
to
raise
the
money
;
and
looking
at
it
th
'
<EOS>
other
way
,
you
'll
be
obliged
to
pay
it
.

You
wo
n't
think
ill

me
for
speaking
the
truth

"
  
"
Uncle
,
"
said
Tom
,
looking
up
suddenly
from
his
meditative
view
of
the
tablecloth
,
"
I
do
n't
think
it
would
be
right
for
my
aunt
Moss
to
pay
the
money
if
it
would
be
against
my
father
's
will
for
her
to
pay
it
;
would
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
looked
surprised
for
a
moment
or
two
before
he
said
:
"
Why
,
no
,
perhaps
not
,
Tom
;
but
then
he
'd
ha

destroyed
the
note

you
know

<EOS>
We
must
look
for
the
note

<EOS>
What
makes
you
think
it

ud
be
against
his
will

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
said
Tom
,
coloring
,
but
trying
to
speak
firmly
,
in
spite
of
a
boyish
tremor
,
"
<EOS>
I
remember
quite
well
,
before
I
went
to
school
to
Mr.
Stelling
,
my
father
said
to
me
one
night
,
when
we
were
sitting
by
the
fire
together
,
and
no
one
else
was
in
the
room
   
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
hesitated
a
little
,
and
then
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
said
something
to
me
about
Maggie
,
and
then
he
said
:
"
I
've
always
been
good
to
my
sister
,
though
she
married
against
my
will
,
and
I
've
lent
Moss
money
;
but
I
shall
never
think
of
distressing
him
to
pay
it
;
I
'd
rather
lose
it
.
<EOS>
My
children
must
not
mind
being
the
poorer
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
And
now
my
father
's
ill
,
and
not
able
to
speak
for
himself
,
I
should
n't
like
anything
to
be
done
contrary
to
what
he
said
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
but
then
,
my
boy
,
"
said
Uncle
Glegg
,
whose
good
feeling
led
him
to
enter
into
Tom
's
wish
,
but
who
could
not
at
once
shake
off
his
habitual
abhorrence
of
such
recklessness
as
destroying
securities
,
or
alienating
anything
important
enough
to
make
an
appreciable
difference
in
a
man
's
property
,
"
we
should
have
to
make
away
wi
'
the
note
,
you
know
,
if
we
're
to
guard
against
what
may
happen
,
supposing
your
father
's
made
bankrupt
   
"
  
"
Mr.
Glegg
,
"
interrupted
his
wife
,
severely
,
"
<EOS>
mind
what
you
're
saying
.
<EOS>
You
're
putting
yourself
very
forrard
in
other
folks
's
business
.
<EOS>
If
you
speak
rash
,
do
n't
say
it
was
my
fault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
such
a
thing
as
I
never
heared
of
before
,
"
said
uncle
Pullet
,
who
had
been
making
haste
with
his
lozenge
in
order
to
express
his
amazement
,
 
"
making
away
with
a
note
!
<EOS>
I
should
think
anybody
could
set
the
constable
on
you
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
"
if
the
note
's
worth
all
that
money
,
why
ca
n't
we
pay
it
away
,
and
save
my
things
from
going
away
?
<EOS>
We
've
no
call
to
meddle
with
your
uncle
and
aunt
Moss
,
Tom
,
if
you
think
your
father
'
ud
be
angry
when
he
gets
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
not
studied
the
question
of
exchange
,
and
was
straining
her
mind
after
original
ideas
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
,
pooh
,
pooh
!
<EOS>
you
women
do
n't
understand
these
things
,
"
said
uncle
Glegg
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
way
o
'
making
it
safe
for
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Moss
but
destroying
the
note
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
hope
you
'll
help
me
do
it
,
uncle
,
"
said
Tom
,
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
If
my
father
should
n't
get
well
,
I
should
be
very
unhappy
to
think
anything
had
been
done
against
his
will
that
I
could
hinder
.
<EOS>
And
I
'm
sure
he
meant
me
to
remember
what
he
said
that
evening
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
obey
my
father
's
wish
about
his
property
.
"
  
<EOS>
Even
Mrs.
Glegg
could
not
withhold
her
approval
from
Tom
's
words
;
she
felt
that
the
Dodson
blood
was
certainly
speaking
in
him
,
though
,
if
his
father
had
been
a
Dodson
,
there
would
never
have
been
this
wicked
alienation
of
money
.
<EOS>
Maggie
would
hardly
have
restrained
herself
from
leaping
on
Tom
's
neck
,
if
her
aunt
Moss
had
not
prevented
her
by
herself
rising
and
taking
Tom
's
hand
,
while
she
said
,
with
rather
a
choked
voice
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
never
be
the
poorer
for
this
,
my
dear
boy
,
if
there
's
a
God
above
;
and
if
the
money
's
wanted
for
your
father
,
Moss
and
me
"
ull
pay
it
,
the
same
as
if
there
was
ever
such
security
.
<EOS>
We
'll
do
as
we
'd
be
done
by
;
for
if
my
children
have
got
no
other
luck
,
they
've
got
an
honest
father
and
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
who
had
been
meditating
after
Tom
's
words
,
"
we
should
n't
be
doing
any
wrong
by
the
creditors
,
supposing
your
father
_
was
_
bankrupt
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
thinking
o
'
that
,
for
I
've
been
a
creditor
myself
,
and
seen
no
end
o
'
cheating
.
<EOS>
If
he
meant
to
give
your
aunt
the
money
before
ever
he
got
into
this
sad
work
o
'
lawing
<EOS>
,
it
's
the
same
as
if
he
'd
made
away
with
the
note
himself
;
for
he
'd
made
up
his
mind
to
be
that
much
poorer
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
a
deal
<EOS>
o
'
things
to
be
considered
,
young
man
,
"
Mr.
Glegg
added
,
looking
admonishingly
at
Tom
,
"
when
you
come
to
money
business
,
and
you
may
be
taking
one
man
's
dinner
away
to
make
another
man
's
breakfast
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
understand
that
,
I
doubt
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
,
"
said
Tom
,
decidedly
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
if
I
owe
money
to
one
man
,
I
've
no
right
to
give
it
to
another
.
<EOS>
But
if
my
father
had
made
up
his
mind
to
give
my
aunt
the
money
before
he
was
in
debt
,
he
had
a
right
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
done
,
young
man
!
<EOS>
I
did
n't
think
you
'd
been
so
sharp
,
"
said
uncle
Glegg
,
with
much
candor
.
<EOS>
"
But
perhaps
your
father
_
did
_
make
away
with
the
note
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
and
see
if
we
can
find
it
in
the
chest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
in
my
father
's
room
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
too
,
aunt
Gritty
,
"
whispered
Maggie
.
    
<EOS>
A
Vanishing
Gleam
  
Mr.
Tulliver
,
even
between
the
fits
of
spasmodic
rigidity
which
had
recurred
at
intervals
ever
since
he
had
been
found
fallen
from
his
horse
,
was
usually
in
so
apathetic
a
condition
that
the
exits
and
entrances
into
his
room
were
not
felt
to
be
of
great
importance
.
<EOS>
He
had
lain
so
still
,
with
his
eyes
closed
,
all
this
morning
,
that
Maggie
told
her
aunt
Moss
<EOS>
she
must
not
expect
her
father
to
take
any
notice
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
entered
very
quietly
,
and
Mrs.
Moss
took
her
seat
near
the
head
of
the
bed
,
while
Maggie
sat
in
her
old
place
on
the
bed
,
and
put
her
hand
on
her
father
's
without
causing
any
change
in
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
and
Tom
had
also
entered
,
treading
softly
,
and
were
busy
selecting
the
key
of
the
old
oak
chest
from
the
bunch
which
Tom
had
brought
from
his
father
's
bureau
.
<EOS>
They
succeeded
in
opening
the
chest
,
 
which
stood
opposite
the
foot
of
Mr.
Tulliver
's
bed
,
 
and
propping
the
lid
with
the
iron
holder
,
without
much
noise
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
tin
box
,
"
whispered
Mr.
Glegg
;
"
he
'd
most
like
put
a
small
thing
like
a
note
in
there
.
<EOS>
Lift
it
out
,
Tom
;
but
I
'll
just
lift
up
these
deeds
,
 
<EOS>
they
're
the
deeds
<EOS>
o
'
the
house
and
mill
,
I
suppose
,
 
and
see
what
there
is
under
'
em
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
had
lifted
out
the
parchments
,
and
had
fortunately
drawn
back
a
little
,
when
the
iron
holder
gave
way
,
and
the
heavy
lid
fell
with
a
loud
bang
that
resounded
over
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
there
was
something
in
that
sound
more
than
the
mere
fact
of
the
strong
vibration
that
produced
the
instantaneous
effect
on
the
frame
of
the
prostrate
man
,
and
for
the
time
completely
shook
off
the
obstruction
of
paralysis
.
<EOS>
The
chest
had
belonged
to
his
father
and
his
father
's
father
,
and
it
had
always
been
rather
a
solemn
business
to
visit
it
.
<EOS>
All
long
-
known
objects
,
even
a
mere
window
fastening
or
a
particular
door
-
latch
,
have
sounds
which
are
a
sort
of
recognized
voice
to
us
,
 
a
voice
that
will
thrill
and
awaken
,
when
it
has
been
used
to
touch
deep
-
lying
fibres
.
<EOS>
In
the
same
moment
,
when
all
the
eyes
in
the
room
were
turned
upon
him
,
he
started
up
and
looked
at
the
chest
,
the
parchments
in
Mr.
Glegg
's
hand
,
and
Tom
holding
the
tin
box
,
with
a
glance
of
perfect
consciousness
and
recognition
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
going
to
do
with
those
deeds
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
in
his
ordinary
tone
of
sharp
questioning
whenever
he
was
irritated
.
<EOS>
"
Come
here
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
do
,
going
to
my
chest
?
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
obeyed
,
with
some
trembling
;
it
was
the
first
time
his
father
had
recognized
him
.
<EOS>
But
instead
of
saying
anything
more
to
him
,
his
father
continued
to
look
with
a
growing
distinctness
of
suspicion
at
Mr.
Glegg
and
the
deeds
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
been
happening
,
then
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
meddling
with
my
deeds
for
?
<EOS>
Is
Wakem
laying
hold
of
everything
?
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
tell
me
what
you
've
been
a
-
doing
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
impatiently
,
as
Mr.
Glegg
advanced
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
before
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
friend
Tulliver
,
"
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
in
a
soothing
tone
.
<EOS>
"
Nobody
's
getting
hold
of
anything
as
yet
.
<EOS>
We
only
came
to
look
and
see
what
was
in
the
chest
.
<EOS>
You
've
been
ill
,
you
know
,
and
we
've
had
to
look
after
things
a
bit
.
<EOS>
But
let
's
hope
you
'll
soon
be
well
enough
to
attend
to
everything
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
looked
around
him
meditatively
,
at
Tom
,
at
Mr.
Glegg
,
and
at
Maggie
;
then
suddenly
appearing
aware
that
some
one
was
seated
by
his
side
at
the
head
of
the
bed
he
turned
sharply
round
and
saw
his
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
Gritty
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
in
the
half
-
sad
,
affectionate
tone
in
which
he
had
been
wo
nt
to
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
you
're
there
,
are
you
?
<EOS>
How
could
you
manage
to
leave
the
children
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
brother
!
"
said
good
Mrs.
Moss
,
too
impulsive
to
be
prudent
,
"
I
'm
thankful
<EOS>
I
'm
come
now
to
see
you
yourself
again
<EOS>
;
I
thought
you
'd
never
know
us
any
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
have
I
had
a
stroke
?
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
anxiously
,
looking
at
Mr.
Glegg
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
fall
from
your
horse
 
shook
you
a
bit
,
 
<EOS>
that
's
all
,
I
think
,
"
said
Mr.
Glegg
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
'll
soon
get
over
it
,
let
's
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
bed
-
clothes
,
and
remained
silent
for
two
or
three
minutes
.
<EOS>
A
new
shadow
came
over
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
looked
up
at
Maggie
first
,
and
said
in
a
lower
tone
,
"
You
got
the
letter
,
then
,
my
wench
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
father
,
"
she
said
,
kissing
him
with
a
full
heart
.
<EOS>
She
felt
as
if
her
father
were
come
back
to
her
from
the
dead
,
and
her
yearning
to
show
him
how
she
had
always
loved
him
could
be
fulfilled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
's
your
mother
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
so
preoccupied
that
he
received
the
kiss
as
passively
as
some
quiet
animal
might
have
received
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
downstairs
with
my
aunts
,
father
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
fetch
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
;
poor
Bessy
!
"
<EOS>
and
his
eyes
turned
toward
Tom
as
Maggie
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
have
to
take
care
of
'em
both
if
I
die
,
you
know
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
You
'll
be
badly
off
,
I
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
see
and
pay
everybody
.
<EOS>
And
mind
,
 
there
's
<EOS>
fifty
pound
o
<EOS>
'
Luke
's
<EOS>
as
I
put
into
the
business
,
 
he
gave
me
a
bit
at
a
time
,
and
he
's
got
nothing
to
show
for
it
.
<EOS>
You
must
pay
him
first
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
Uncle
Glegg
involuntarily
shook
his
head
,
and
looked
more
concerned
than
ever
,
but
Tom
said
firmly
:
  
"
Yes
,
father
.
<EOS>
And
have
n't
you
a
note
from
my
uncle
Moss
for
three
hundred
pounds
?
<EOS>
We
came
to
look
for
that
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
wish
to
be
done
about
it
,
father
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
you
thought
o
'
that
,
my
lad
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
"
I
allays
meant
to
be
easy
about
that
money
,
because
o
'
your
aunt
.
<EOS>
You
must
n't
mind
losing
the
money
,
if
they
ca
n't
pay
it
,
 
and
it
's
like
enough
they
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
The
note
's
in
that
box
,
mind
!
<EOS>
I
allays
meant
to
be
good
to
you
,
Gritty
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
turning
to
his
sister
;
"
but
you
know
you
aggravated
me
when
you
would
have
Moss
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Maggie
re
-
entered
with
her
mother
,
who
came
in
much
agitated
by
the
news
that
her
husband
was
quite
himself
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Bessy
,
"
he
said
,
as
she
kissed
him
,
"
you
must
forgive
me
if
you
're
worse
off
than
you
ever
expected
to
be
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
the
fault
o
'
<EOS>
the
law
,
 
it
's
none
o
'
mine
,
"
he
added
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
fault
o
'
raskills
.
<EOS>
Tom
,
you
mind
this
:
if
ever
you
've
got
the
chance
,
you
make
Wakem
smart

<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
,
you
're
a
good

for

nothing
son

<EOS>
You
might
horse
-
whip
him
,
but
he

Mr.
Tulliver
was
getting
excited
,
and
an
alarming
flush
was
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
wanted
to
say
something
soothing
,
but
he
was
prevented
by
Mr.
Tulliver
's
speaking
again
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
They
'll
make
a
shift
to
pay
everything
,
Bessy
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
yet
leave
you
your
furniture
;
and
your
sisters'll
do
something
for
you
 
and
Tom'll
grow
up
 
though
what
he
's
to
be
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
 
<EOS>
I
've
done
what
I
could

've
given
him
a
eddication
 
<EOS>
and
there
's
the
little
wench
<EOS>
,
she
'll
get
married
 
but
<EOS>
it
's
a
poor
tale
   
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
sanative
effect
of
the
strong
vibration
was
exhausted
,
and
with
the
last
words
the
poor
man
fell
again
,
rigid
and
insensible
.
<EOS>
Though
this
was
only
a
recurrence
of
what
had
happened
before
,
it
struck
all
present
as
if
it
had
been
death
,
not
only
from
its
contrast
with
the
completeness
of
the
revival
,
but
because
his
words
had
all
had
reference
to
the
possibility
that
his
death
was
near
.
<EOS>
But
with
poor
Tulliver
death
was
not
to
be
a
leap
;
it
was
to
be
a
long
descent
under
thickening
shadows
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
was
sent
for
;
but
when
he
heard
what
had
passed
,
he
said
this
complete
restoration
,
though
only
temporary
,
was
a
hopeful
sign
,
proving
that
there
was
no
permanent
lesion
to
prevent
ultimate
recovery
.
  
<EOS>
Among
the
threads
of
the
past
which
the
stricken
man
had
gathered
up
,
he
had
omitted
the
bill
of
sale
;
the
flash
of
memory
had
only
lit
up
prominent
ideas
,
and
he
sank
into
forgetfulness
again
with
half
his
humiliation
unlearned
.
  
<EOS>
But
Tom
was
clear
upon
two
points
,
 
that
his
uncle
Moss
's
note
must
be
destroyed
;
and
that
Luke
's
money
must
be
paid
,
if
in
no
other
way
,
out
of
his
own
and
Maggie
's
money
now
in
the
savings
bank
.
<EOS>
There
were
subjects
,
you
perceive
,
on
which
Tom
was
much
quicker
than
on
the
niceties
of
classical
construction
,
or
the
relations
of
a
mathematical
demonstration
.
    
<EOS>
Tom
Applies
His
Knife
to
the
Oyster
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
,
at
ten
o'clock
,
Tom
was
on
his
way
to
St.
Ogg
's
,
to
see
his
uncle
Deane
,
who
was
to
come
home
last
night
,
his
aunt
had
said
;
and
Tom
had
made
up
his
mind
that
his
uncle
Deane
was
the
right
person
to
ask
for
advice
about
getting
some
employment
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
a
great
way
of
business
;
he
had
not
the
narrow
notions
of
uncle
Glegg
;
and
he
had
risen
in
the
world
on
a
scale
of
advancement
which
accorded
with
Tom
's
ambition
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
dark
,
chill
,
misty
morning
,
likely
to
end
in
rain
,
 
one
of
those
mornings
when
even
happy
people
take
refuge
in
their
hopes
.
<EOS>
And
Tom
was
very
unhappy
;
he
felt
the
humiliation
as
well
as
the
prospective
hardships
of
his
lot
with
all
the
keenness
of
a
proud
nature
;
and
with
all
his
resolute
dutifulness
toward
his
father
there
mingled
an
irrepressible
indignation
against
him
which
gave
misfortune
the
less
endurable
aspect
of
a
wrong
.
<EOS>
Since
these
were
the
consequences
of
going
to
law
,
his
father
was
really
blamable
,
as
his
aunts
and
uncles
had
always
said
he
was
;
and
it
was
a
significant
indication
of
Tom
's
character
,
that
though
he
thought
his
aunts
ought
to
do
something
more
for
his
mother
,
he
felt
nothing
like
Maggie
's
violent
resentment
against
them
for
showing
no
eager
tenderness
and
generosity
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
impulses
in
Tom
that
led
him
to
expect
what
did
not
present
itself
to
him
as
a
right
to
be
demanded
.
<EOS>
Why
should
people
give
away
their
money
plentifully
to
those
who
had
not
taken
care
of
their
own
money
?
<EOS>
Tom
saw
some
justice
in
severity
;
and
all
the
more
,
because
he
had
confidence
in
himself
that
he
should
never
deserve
that
just
severity
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
hard
upon
him
that
he
should
be
put
at
this
disadvantage
in
life
by
his
father
's
want
of
prudence
;
but
he
was
not
going
to
complain
and
to
find
fault
with
people
because
they
did
not
make
everything
easy
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
ask
no
one
to
help
him
,
more
than
to
give
him
work
and
pay
him
for
it
.
<EOS>
Poor
Tom
was
not
without
his
hopes
to
take
refuge
in
under
the
chill
damp
imprisonment
of
the
December
fog
,
which
seemed
only
like
a
part
of
his
home
troubles
.
<EOS>
At
sixteen
,
the
mind
that
has
the
strongest
affinity
for
fact
can
not
escape
illusion
and
self
-
flattery
;
and
Tom
,
in
sketching
his
future
,
had
no
other
guide
in
arranging
his
facts
than
the
suggestions
of
his
own
brave
self
-
reliance
.
<EOS>
Both
Mr.
Glegg
and
Mr.
Deane
,
he
knew
,
had
been
very
poor
once
;
he
did
not
want
to
save
money
slowly
and
retire
on
a
moderate
fortune
like
his
uncle
Glegg
,
but
he
would
be
like
his
uncle
Deane
 
get
a
situation
in
some
great
house
of
business
and
rise
fast
.
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
seen
anything
of
his
uncle
Deane
for
the
last
three
years
 
the
two
families
had
been
getting
wider
apart
;
but
for
this
very
reason
Tom
was
the
more
hopeful
about
applying
to
him
.
<EOS>
His
uncle
Glegg
<EOS>
,
he
felt
sure
,
would
never
encourage
any
spirited
project
,
but
he
had
a
vague
imposing
idea
of
the
resources
at
his
uncle
Deane
's
command
.
<EOS>
He
had
heard
his
father
say
,
long
ago
,
how
Deane
had
made
himself
so
valuable
to
Guest
&
Co.
that
they
were
glad
enough
to
offer
him
a
share
in
the
business
;
that
was
what
Tom
resolved
_
he
_
would
do
.
<EOS>
It
was
intolerable
to
think
of
being
poor
and
looked
down
upon
all
one
's
life
.
<EOS>
He
would
provide
for
his
mother
and
sister
,
and
make
every
one
say
that
he
was
a
man
of
high
character
.
<EOS>
He
leaped
over
the
years
in
this
way
,
and
,
in
the
haste
of
strong
purpose
and
strong
desire
,
did
not
see
how
they
would
be
made
up
of
slow
days
,
hours
,
and
minutes
.
  
<EOS>
By
the
time
he
had
crossed
the
stone
bridge
over
the
Floss
and
was
entering
St.
Ogg
's
,
he
was
thinking
that
he
would
buy
his
father
's
mill
and
land
again
when
he
was
rich
enough
,
and
improve
the
house
and
live
there
;
he
should
prefer
it
to
any
smarter
,
newer
place
,
and
he
could
keep
as
many
horses
and
dogs
as
he
liked
.
  
<EOS>
Walking
along
the
street
with
a
firm
,
rapid
step
,
at
this
point
in
his
reverie
he
was
startled
by
some
one
who
had
crossed
without
his
notice
,
and
who
said
to
him
in
a
rough
,
familiar
voice
:
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Master
Tom
,
how
's
your
father
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
publican
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
one
of
his
father
's
customers
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
disliked
being
spoken
to
just
then
;
but
he
said
civilly
,
"
He
's
still
very
ill
,
thank
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
it
's
been
a
sore
chance
for
you
,
young
man
,
has
n't
it
,
 
this
lawsuit
turning
out
against
him
?
"
said
the
publican
,
with
a
confused
,
beery
idea
of
being
good
-
natured
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
reddened
and
passed
on
;
he
would
have
felt
it
like
the
handling
of
a
bruise
,
even
if
there
had
been
the
most
polite
and
delicate
reference
to
his
position
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
Tulliver
's
son
,
"
said
the
publican
to
a
grocer
standing
on
the
adjacent
door
-
step
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
the
grocer
,
"
I
thought
I
knew
his
features
.
<EOS>
He
takes
after
his
mother
's
family
;
she
was
a
Dodson
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
fine
,
straight
youth
;
what
's
he
been
brought
up
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
to
turn
up
his
nose
at
his
father
's
customers
,
and
be
a
fine
gentleman
,
 
not
much
else
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
,
roused
from
his
dream
of
the
future
to
a
thorough
consciousness
of
the
present
,
made
all
the
greater
haste
to
reach
the
warehouse
offices
of
Guest
&
Co.
,
where
he
expected
to
find
his
uncle
Deane
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
Mr.
Deane
's
morning
at
the
band
,
a
clerk
told
him
,
and
with
some
contempt
for
his
ignorance
;
Mr.
Deane
was
not
to
be
found
in
River
Street
on
a
Thursday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
bank
Tom
was
admitted
into
the
private
room
where
his
uncle
was
,
immediately
after
sending
in
his
name
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
was
auditing
accounts
;
but
he
looked
up
as
Tom
entered
,
and
putting
out
his
hand
,
said
,
"
Well
,
Tom
,
nothing
fresh
the
matter
at
home
<EOS>
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
How
's
your
father
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Much
the
same
,
thank
you
,
uncle
,
"
said
Tom
,
feeling
nervous
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
want
to
speak
to
you
,
please
,
when
you
're
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Sit
down
,
sit
down
,
"
said
Mr.
Deane
,
relapsing
into
his
accounts
,
in
which
he
and
the
managing
-
clerk
remained
so
absorbed
for
the
next
half
-
hour
that
Tom
began
to
wonder
whether
he
should
have
to
sit
in
this
way
till
the
bank
closed
,
 
there
seemed
so
little
tendency
toward
a
conclusion
in
the
quiet
,
monotonous
procedure
of
these
sleek
,
prosperous
men
of
business
.
<EOS>
Would
his
uncle
give
him
a
place
in
the
bank
?
<EOS>
It
would
be
very
dull
,
prosy
work
,
he
thought
,
writing
there
forever
to
the
loud
ticking
of
a
timepiece
.
<EOS>
He
preferred
some
other
way
of
getting
rich
.
<EOS>
But
at
last
there
was
a
change
;
his
uncle
took
a
pen
and
wrote
something
with
a
flourish
at
the
end
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
just
step
up
to
Torry
's
now
,
Mr.
Spence
,
will
you
?
"
said
Mr.
Deane
,
and
the
clock
suddenly
became
less
loud
and
deliberate
in
Tom
's
ears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Tom
,
"
said
Mr.
Deane
,
when
they
were
alone
,
turning
his
substantial
person
a
little
in
his
chair
,
and
taking
out
his
snuff
-
box
;
<EOS>
"
what
's
the
business
,
my
boy
;
what
's
the
business
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
,
who
had
heard
from
his
wife
what
had
passed
the
day
before
,
thought
Tom
was
come
to
appeal
to
him
for
some
means
of
averting
the
sale
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
'll
excuse
me
for
troubling
you
,
uncle
,
"
said
Tom
,
coloring
,
but
speaking
in
a
tone
which
,
though
,
tremulous
,
had
a
certain
proud
independence
in
it
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
thought
you
were
the
best
person
to
advise
me
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr.
Deane
,
reserving
his
pinch
of
snuff
,
and
looking
at
Tom
with
new
attention
,
"
let
us
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
get
a
situation
,
uncle
,
so
that
I
may
earn
some
money
,
"
said
Tom
,
who
never
fell
into
circumlocution
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
situation
?
"
said
Mr.
Deane
,
and
then
took
his
pinch
of
snuff
with
elaborate
justice
to
each
nostril
.
<EOS>
Tom
thought
snuff
-
taking
a
most
provoking
habit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
let
me
see
,
how
old
are
you
?
"
said
Mr.
Deane
,
as
he
threw
himself
backward
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sixteen
;
I
mean
,
I
am
going
in
seventeen
,
"
said
Tom
,
hoping
his
uncle
noticed
how
much
beard
he
had
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
;
your
father
had
some
notion
of
making
you
an
engineer
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
think
I
could
get
any
money
at
that
for
a
long
while
,
could
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
;
but
people
do
n't
get
much
money
at
anything
,
my
boy
,
when
they
're
only
sixteen
.
<EOS>
You
've
had
a
good
deal
of
schooling
,
however
;
I
suppose
you
're
pretty
well
up
in
accounts
,
eh
?
<EOS>
You
understand
book
keeping
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Tom
,
rather
falteringly
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
in
Practice
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Stelling
says
I
write
a
good
hand
,
uncle
.
<EOS>
That
's
my
writing
,
"
added
Tom
,
laying
on
the
table
a
copy
of
the
list
he
had
made
yesterday
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
that
's
good
<EOS>
,
that
's
good
.
<EOS>
But
,
you
see
,
the
best
hand
in
the
world'll
not
get
you
a
better
place
than
a
copying
-
clerk
's
,
if
you
know
nothing
of
book
-
keeping
,
 
nothing
of
accounts
.
<EOS>
And
a
copying
-
clerk
's
a
cheap
article
.
<EOS>
But
what
have
you
been
learning
at
school
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
had
not
occupied
himself
with
methods
of
education
,
and
had
no
precise
conception
of
what
went
forward
in
expensive
schools
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
learned
Latin
,
"
said
Tom
,
pausing
a
little
between
each
item
,
as
if
he
were
turning
over
the
books
in
his
school
-
desk
to
assist
his
memory
,
 
"
a
good
deal
of
Latin
;
and
the
last
year
I
did
Themes
,
one
week
in
Latin
and
one
in
English
;
and
Greek
and
Roman
history
;
and
Euclid
;
and
I
began
Algebra
,
but
I
left
it
off
again
;
and
we
had
one
day
every
week
for
Arithmetic
.
<EOS>
Then
I
used
to
have
drawing
-
lessons
;
and
there
were
several
other
books
we
either
read
or
learned
out
of
,
 
English
Poetry
,
and
Horæ
Pauliné
and
Blair
's
Rhetoric
,
the
last

Mr.
Deane
tapped
his
snuff
-
box
again
and
screwed
up
his
mouth
;
he
felt
in
the
position
of
many
estimable
persons
when
they
had
read
the
New
Tariff
,
and
found
how
many
commodities
were
imported
of
which
they
knew
nothing
;
like
a
cautious
man
of
business
,
he
was
not
going
to
speak
rashly
of
a
raw
material
in
which
he
had
had
no
experience
.
<EOS>
But
the
presumption
was
,
that
if
it
had
been
good
for
anything
,
so
successful
a
man
as
himself
would
hardly
have
been
ignorant
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
About
Latin
he
had
an
opinion
,
and
thought
that
in
case
of
another
war
,
since
people
would
no
longer
wear
hair
-
powder
,
it
would
be
well
to
put
a
tax
upon
Latin
,
as
a
luxury
much
run
upon
by
the
higher
classes
,
and
not
telling
at
all
on
the
ship
-
owning
department
.
<EOS>
But
,
for
what
he
knew
,
the
Horé
Pauliné
might
be
something
less
neutral
.
<EOS>
On
the
whole
,
this
list
of
acquirements
gave
him
a
sort
of
repulsion
toward
poor
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
he
said
at
last
,
in
rather
a
cold
,
sardonic
tone
,
"
you
've
had
three
years
at
these
things
,
 
you
must
be
pretty
strong
in
'em
.
<EOS>
Had
n't
you
better
take
up
some
line
where
they
'll
come
in
handy
?
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
colored
,
and
burst
out
,
with
new
energy
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
rather
not
have
any
employment
of
that
sort
,
uncle
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
Latin
and
those
things
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
I
could
do
with
them
unless
I
went
as
usher
in
a
school
;
and
I
do
n't
know
them
well
enough
for
that
!
<EOS>
besides
,
I
would
as
soon
carry
a
pair
of
panniers
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
be
that
sort
of
person
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
enter
into
some
business
where
I
can
get
on
,
 
a
manly
business
,
where
I
should
have
to
look
after
things
,
and
get
credit
for
what
I
did
.
<EOS>
And
I
shall
want
to
keep
my
mother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
young
gentleman
,
"
said
Mr.
Deane
,
with
that
tendency
to
repress
youthful
hopes
which
stout
and
successful
men
of
fifty
find
one
of
their
easiest
duties
,
"
that
's
sooner
said
than
done
<EOS>
,
 
sooner
said
than
done
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
did
n't
_
<EOS>
you
_
get
on
in
that
way
,
uncle
?
"
<EOS>
said
Tom
,
a
little
irritated
that
Mr.
Deane
did
not
enter
more
rapidly
into
his
views
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
did
n't
you
rise
from
one
place
to
another
through
your
abilities
and
good
conduct
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr.
Deane
,
spreading
himself
in
his
chair
a
little
,
and
entering
with
great
readiness
into
a
retrospect
of
his
own
career
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
'll
tell
you
how
I
got
on
.
<EOS>
It
was
n't
by
getting
astride
a
stick
and
thinking
it
would
turn
into
a
horse
if
I
sat
on
it
long
enough
.
<EOS>
I
kept
my
eyes
and
ears
open
,
sir
,
and
I
was
n't
too
fond
of
my
own
back
,
and
I
made
my
master
's
interest
my
own
.
<EOS>
Why
,
with
only
looking
into
what
went
on
in
the
mill
,
,
I
found
out
how
there
was
a
waste
of
five
hundred
a
-
year
that
might
be
hindered
.
<EOS>
Why
,
sir
,
I
had
n't
more
schooling
to
begin
with
than
a
charity
boy
;
but
I
saw
pretty
soon
that
I
could
n't
get
on
far
enough
without
mastering
accounts
,
and
I
learned
'em
between
working
hours
,
after
I
'd
been
unlading
.
<EOS>
Look
here
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
opened
a
book
and
pointed
to
the
page
.
<EOS>
"
I
write
a
good
hand
enough
,
and
I
'll
match
anybody
at
all
sorts
of
reckoning
by
the
head
;
and
I
got
it
all
by
hard
work
,
and
paid
for
it
out
of
my
own
earnings
,
 
often
out
of
my
own
dinner
and
supper
.
<EOS>
And
I
looked
into
the
nature
of
all
the
things
we
had
to
do
in
the
business
,
and
picked
up
knowledge
as
I
went
about
my
work
,
and
turned
it
over
in
my
head
.
<EOS>
Why
,
I
'm
no
mechanic
,
 
I
never
pretended
to
be
 
<EOS>
but
I
've
thought
of
a
thing
or
two
that
the
mechanics
never
thought
of
,
and
it
's
made
a
fine
difference
in
our
returns
.
<EOS>
And
there
is
n't
an
article
shipped
or
unshipped
at
our
wharf
<EOS>
but
I
know
the
quality
of
it
.
<EOS>
If
I
got
places
,
sir
,
it
was
because
I
made
myself
fit
for
'em
.
<EOS>
If
you
want
to
slip
into
a
round
hole
,
you
must
make
a
ball
of
yourself
;
that
's
where
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
tapped
his
box
again
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
led
on
by
pure
enthusiasm
in
his
subject
,
and
had
really
forgotten
what
bearing
this
retrospective
survey
had
on
his
listener
.
<EOS>
He
had
found
occasion
for
saying
the
same
thing
more
than
once
before
,
and
was
not
distinctly
aware
that
he
had
not
his
port
-
wine
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
uncle
,
"
said
Tom
,
with
a
slight
complaint
in
his
tone
,
<EOS>
"
that
's
what
I
should
like
to
do
.
<EOS>
Ca
n't
_
I
_
get
on
in
the
same
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
In
the
same
way
?
"
said
Mr.
Deane
,
eyeing
Tom
with
quiet
deliberation
.
<EOS>
"
There
go
two
or
three
questions
to
that
,
Master
Tom
.
<EOS>
That
depends
on
what
sort
of
material
you
are
,
to
begin
with
,
and
whether
you
've
been
put
into
the
right
mill
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
Your
poor
father
went
the
wrong
way
to
work
in
giving
you
an
education
.
<EOS>
It
was
n't
my
business
,
and
I
did
n't
interfere
;
but
it
is
as
I
thought
it
would
be
.
<EOS>
You
've
had
a
sort
of
learning
that
's
all
very
well
for
a
young
fellow
like
our
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
,
who
'll
have
nothing
to
do
but
sign
checks
all
his
life
,
and
may
as
well
have
Latin
inside
his
head
as
any
other
sort
of
stuffing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
uncle
,
"
said
Tom
,
earnestly
,
"
I
do
n't
see
why
the
Latin
need
hinder
me
from
getting
on
in
business
.
<EOS>
I
shall
soon
forget
it
all
;
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
to
do
my
lessons
at
school
,
but
I
always
thought
they
'd
never
be
of
any
use
to
me
afterward
;
I
did
n't
care
about
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
that
's
all
very
well
,
"
said
Mr.
Deane
;
"
but
it
does
n't
alter
what
I
was
going
to
say
.
<EOS>
Your
Latin
and
rigmarole
may
soon
dry
off
you
,
but
you
'll
be
but
a
bare
stick
after
that
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
's
whitened
your
hands
and
taken
the
rough
work
out
of
you
.
<EOS>
And
what
do
you
know
?
<EOS>
Why
,
you
know
nothing
about
book
-
keeping
,
to
begin
with
,
and
not
so
much
of
reckoning
as
a
common
shopman
.
<EOS>
You
'll
have
to
begin
at
a
low
round
of
the
ladder
,
let
me
tell
you
,
if
you
mean
to
get
on
in
life
.
<EOS>
It
's
no
use
forgetting
the
education
your
father
's
been
paying
for
,
if
you
do
n't
give
yourself
a
new
un
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
bit
his
lips
hard
;
he
felt
as
if
the
tears
were
rising
,
and
he
would
rather
die
than
let
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
me
to
help
you
to
a
situation
,
"
Mr.
Deane
went
on
;
"
<EOS>
well
,
I
've
no
fault
to
find
with
that
.
<EOS>
I
'm
willing
to
do
something
for
you
.
<EOS>
But
you
youngsters
nowadays
think
you
're
to
begin
with
living
well
and
working
easy
;
you
've
no
notion
of
running
afoot
before
you
get
horseback
.
<EOS>
Now
,
you
must
remember
what
you
are
,
 
you
're
a
lad
of
sixteen
,
trained
to
nothing
particular
.
<EOS>
There
's
heaps
of
your
sort
,
like
so
many
pebbles
,
made
to
fit
in
nowhere
.
<EOS>
Well
,
you
might
be
apprenticed
to
some
business
,
 
a
chemist
's
and
druggist
's
perhaps
;
your
Latin
might
come
in
a
bit
there
   
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
was
going
to
speak
,
but
Mr.
Deane
put
up
his
hand
and
said
:
  
"
<EOS>
Stop
!
<EOS>
hear
what
I
've
got
to
say
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
want
to
be
a
"
prentice
,
 
<EOS>
I
know
,
I
know
,
 
you
want
to
make
more
haste
,
and
you
do
n't
want
to
stand
behind
a
counter
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
're
a
copying
-
clerk
,
you
'll
have
to
stand
behind
a
desk
,
and
stare
at
your
ink
and
paper
all
day
;
there
is
n't
much
out
-
look
there
,
and
you
wo
n't
be
much
wiser
at
the
end
of
the
year
than
at
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
The
world
is
n't
made
of
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
and
if
you
're
to
get
on
in
the
world
,
young
man
,
you
must
know
what
the
world
's
made
of
.
<EOS>
Now
the
best
chance
for
you
'
ud
be
to
have
a
place
on
a
wharf
,
or
in
a
warehouse
,
where
you
'd
learn
the
smell
of
things
,
but
you
would
n't
like
that
,
I
'll
be
bound
;
you
'd
have
to
stand
cold
and
wet
,
and
be
shouldered
about
by
rough
fellows
.
<EOS>
You
're
too
fine
a
gentleman
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
paused
and
looked
hard
at
Tom
,
who
certainly
felt
some
inward
struggle
before
he
could
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
do
what
will
be
best
for
me
in
the
end
,
sir
;
I
would
put
up
with
what
was
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
well
,
if
you
can
carry
it
out
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
remember
it
is
n't
only
laying
hold
of
a
rope
,
you
must
go
on
pulling
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
mistake
<EOS>
you
lads
make
that
have
got
nothing
either
in
your
brains
or
your
pocket
,
to
think
you
've
got
a
better
start
in
the
world
if
you
stick
yourselves
in
a
place
where
you
can
keep
your
coats
clean
,
and
have
the
shopwenches
take
you
for
fine
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
That
was
n't
the
way
_
<EOS>
I
_
started
,
young
man
;
when
I
was
sixteen
,
my
jacket
smelt
of
tar
,
and
I
was
n't
afraid
of
handling
cheeses
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
reason
I
can
wear
good
broadcloth
now
,
and
have
my
legs
under
the
same
table
with
the
head
of
the
best
firms
in
St.
Ogg
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Uncle
Deane
tapped
his
box
,
and
seemed
to
expand
a
little
under
his
waistcoat
and
gold
chain
,
as
he
squared
his
shoulders
in
the
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
place
at
liberty
that
you
know
of
now
,
uncle
,
that
I
should
do
for
?
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
set
to
work
at
once
,
"
said
Tom
,
with
a
slight
tremor
in
his
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
bit
,
stop
a
bit
;
we
must
n't
be
in
too
great
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
You
must
bear
in
mind
,
if
I
put
you
in
a
place
you
're
a
bit
young
for
,
because
you
happen
to
be
my
nephew
,
I
shall
be
responsible
for
you
.
<EOS>
And
there
's
no
better
reason
,
you
know
,
than
your
being
my
nephew
;
because
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
you
're
good
for
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
shall
never
do
you
any
discredit
,
uncle
,
"
said
Tom
,
hurt
,
as
all
boys
are
at
the
statement
of
the
unpleasant
truth
that
people
feel
no
ground
for
trusting
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
care
about
my
own
credit
too
much
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
done
,
Tom
,
well
done
!
<EOS>
That
's
the
right
spirit
,
and
I
never
refuse
to
help
anybody
if
they
've
a
mind
to
do
themselves
justice
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
young
man
of
two
-
and
-
twenty
<EOS>
I
've
got
my
eye
on
now
.
<EOS>
I
shall
do
what
I
can
for
that
young
man
;
he
's
got
some
pith
in
him
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
you
see
,
he
's
made
good
use
of
his
time
,
 
a
first
-
rate
calculator
,
  
can
tell
you
the
cubic
contents
of
anything
in
no
time
,
and
put
me
up
the
other
day
to
a
new
market
for
Swedish
bark
;
he
's
uncommonly
knowing
in
manufactures
,
that
young
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
better
set
about
learning
book
-
keeping
,
had
n't
I
,
uncle
?
"
said
Tom
,
anxious
to
prove
his
readiness
to
exert
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
you
ca
n't
do
amiss
there
.
<EOS>
But
 
Ah
,
Spence
,
you
're
back
again
.
<EOS>
Well
Tom
,
there
's
nothing
more
to
be
said
just
now
,
I
think
,
and
I
must
go
to
business
again
.
<EOS>
Good
-
by
.
<EOS>
Remember
me
to
your
mother
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
put
out
his
hand
,
with
an
air
of
friendly
dismissal
,
and
Tom
had
not
courage
to
ask
another
question
,
especially
in
the
presence
of
Mr.
Spence
.
<EOS>
So
he
went
out
again
into
the
cold
damp
air
.
<EOS>
He
had
to
call
at
his
uncle
Glegg
's
about
the
money
in
the
Savings
Bank
,
and
by
the
time
he
set
out
again
the
mist
had
thickened
,
and
he
could
not
see
very
far
before
him
;
but
going
along
River
Street
again
,
he
was
startled
,
when
he
was
within
two
yards
of
the
projecting
side
of
a
shop
-
window
,
by
the
words
"
Dorlcote
Mill
"
in
large
letters
on
a
hand
-
bill
,
placed
as
if
on
purpose
to
stare
at
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
catalogue
of
the
sale
to
take
place
the
next
week
;
it
was
a
reason
for
hurrying
faster
out
of
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Tom
formed
no
visions
of
the
distant
future
as
he
made
his
way
homeward
;
he
only
felt
that
the
present
was
very
hard
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
a
wrong
toward
him
that
his
uncle
Deane
had
no
confidence
in
him
,
 
did
not
see
at
once
that
he
should
acquit
himself
well
,
which
Tom
himself
was
as
certain
of
as
of
the
daylight
.
<EOS>
Apparently
he
,
Tom
Tulliver
,
was
likely
to
be
held
of
small
account
in
the
world
;
and
for
the
first
time
he
felt
a
sinking
of
heart
under
the
sense
that
he
really
was
very
ignorant
,
and
could
do
very
little
.
<EOS>
Who
was
that
enviable
young
man
that
could
tell
the
cubic
contents
of
things
in
no
time
,
and
make
suggestions
about
Swedish
bark
!
<EOS>
Tom
had
been
used
to
be
so
entirely
satisfied
with
himself
,
in
spite
of
his
breaking
down
in
a
demonstration
,
and
construing
_
nunc
illas
promite
vires
_
as
"
now
promise
those
men
"
;
but
now
he
suddenly
felt
at
a
disadvantage
,
because
he
knew
less
than
some
one
else
knew
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
a
world
of
things
connected
with
that
Swedish
bark
,
which
,
if
he
only
knew
them
,
might
have
helped
him
to
get
on
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
much
easier
to
make
a
figure
with
a
spirited
horse
and
a
new
saddle
.
  
<EOS>
Two
hours
ago
,
as
Tom
was
walking
to
St.
Ogg
's
,
he
saw
the
distant
future
before
him
as
he
might
have
seen
a
tempting
stretch
of
smooth
sandy
beach
beyond
a
belt
of
flinty
shingles
;
he
was
on
the
grassy
bank
then
,
and
thought
the
shingles
might
soon
be
passed
.
<EOS>
But
now
his
feet
were
on
the
sharp
stones
;
the
belt
of
shingles
had
widened
,
and
the
stretch
of
sand
had
dwindled
into
narrowness
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
my
Uncle
Deane
say
,
Tom
?
"
said
Maggie
,
putting
her
arm
through
Tom
's
as
he
was
warming
himself
rather
drearily
by
the
kitchen
fire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did
he
say
he
would
give
you
a
situation
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
did
n't
say
that
.
<EOS>
He
did
n't
quite
promise
me
anything
;
he
seemed
to
think
I
could
n't
have
a
very
good
situation
.
<EOS>
I
'm
too
young
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
did
n't
he
speak
kindly
,
Tom
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Kindly
?
<EOS>
Pooh
!
<EOS>
what
's
the
use
of
talking
about
that
?
<EOS>
I
would
n't
care
about
his
speaking
kindly
,
if
I
could
get
a
situation
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
such
a
nuisance
and
bother
;
I
've
been
at
school
all
this
while
learning
Latin
and
things
,
 
not
a
bit
of
good
to
me
,
 
and
now
my
uncle
says
I
must
set
about
learning
book
-
keeping
and
calculation
,
and
those
things
.
<EOS>
He
seems
to
make
out
I
'm
good
for
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
's
mouth
twitched
with
a
bitter
expression
as
he
looked
at
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
a
pity
we
have
n't
got
Dominie
Sampson
!
"
<EOS>
said
Maggie
,
who
could
n't
help
mingling
some
gayety
with
their
sadness
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
had
taught
me
book
-
keeping
by
double
entry
and
after
the
Italian
method
,
as
he
did
Lucy
Bertram
,
I
could
teach
you
,
Tom
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
_
You
_
teach
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
That
's
always
the
tone
you
take
,
"
said
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Tom
,
I
was
only
joking
,
"
said
Maggie
,
putting
her
cheek
against
his
coat
-
sleeve
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
always
the
same
,
Maggie
,
"
said
Tom
,
with
the
little
frown
he
put
on
when
he
was
about
to
be
justifiably
severe
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
always
setting
yourself
up
above
me
and
every
one
else
,
and
I
've
wanted
to
tell
you
about
it
several
times
.
<EOS>
You
ought
not
to
have
spoken
as
you
did
to
my
uncles
and
aunts
;
you
should
leave
it
to
me
to
take
care
of
my
mother
and
you
,
and
not
put
yourself
forward
.
<EOS>
You
think
you
know
better
than
any
one
,
but
you
're
almost
always
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
can
judge
much
better
than
you
can
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Tom
!
<EOS>
he
had
just
come
from
being
lectured
and
made
to
feel
his
inferiority
;
the
reaction
of
his
strong
,
self
-
asserting
nature
must
take
place
somehow
;
and
here
was
a
case
in
which
he
could
justly
show
himself
dominant
.
<EOS>
Maggie
's
cheek
flushed
and
her
lip
quivered
with
conflicting
resentment
and
affection
,
and
a
certain
awe
as
well
as
admiration
of
Tom
's
firmer
and
more
effective
character
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
answer
immediately
;
very
angry
words
rose
to
her
lips
,
but
they
were
driven
back
again
,
and
she
said
at
last
:
  
"
You
often
think
I
'm
conceited
,
Tom
,
when
I
do
n't
mean
what
I
say
at
all
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
to
put
myself
above
you
;
I
know
you
behaved
better
than
I
did
yesterday
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
always
so
harsh
to
me
,
Tom
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
the
last
words
the
resentment
was
rising
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
'm
not
harsh
,
"
said
Tom
,
with
severe
decision
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
always
kind
to
you
,
and
so
I
shall
be
;
I
shall
always
take
care
of
you
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
mind
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
Their
mother
came
in
now
,
and
Maggie
rushed
away
,
that
her
burst
of
tears
,
which
she
felt
must
come
,
might
not
happen
till
she
was
safe
upstairs
.
<EOS>
They
were
very
bitter
tears
;
everybody
in
the
world
seemed
so
hard
and
unkind
to
Maggie
;
there
was
no
indulgence
,
no
fondness
,
such
as
she
imagined
when
she
fashioned
the
world
afresh
in
her
own
thoughts
.
<EOS>
In
books
there
were
people
who
were
always
agreeable
or
tender
,
and
delighted
to
do
things
that
made
one
happy
,
and
who
did
not
show
their
kindness
by
finding
fault
.
<EOS>
The
world
outside
the
books
was
not
a
happy
one
,
Maggie
felt
;
it
seemed
to
be
a
world
where
people
behaved
the
best
to
those
they
did
not
pretend
to
love
,
and
that
did
not
belong
to
them
.
<EOS>
And
if
life
had
no
love
in
it
,
what
else
was
there
for
Maggie
?
<EOS>
Nothing
but
poverty
and
the
companionship
of
her
mother
's
narrow
griefs
,
perhaps
of
her
father
's
heart
-
cutting
childish
dependence
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
hopelessness
so
sad
as
that
of
early
youth
,
when
the
soul
is
made
up
of
wants
,
and
has
no
long
memories
,
no
superadded
life
in
the
life
of
others
;
though
we
who
looked
on
think
lightly
of
such
premature
despair
,
as
if
our
vision
of
the
future
lightened
the
blind
sufferer
's
present
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
,
in
her
brown
frock
,
with
her
eyes
reddened
and
her
heavy
hair
pushed
back
,
looking
from
the
bed
where
her
father
lay
to
the
dull
walls
of
this
sad
chamber
which
was
the
centre
of
her
world
,
was
a
creature
full
of
eager
,
passionate
longings
for
all
that
was
beautiful
and
glad
;
thirsty
for
all
knowledge
;
with
an
ear
straining
after
dreamy
music
that
died
away
and
would
not
come
near
to
her
;
with
a
blind
,
unconscious
yearning
for
something
that
would
link
together
the
wonderful
impressions
of
this
mysterious
life
,
and
give
her
soul
a
sense
of
home
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
No
wonder
,
when
there
is
this
contrast
between
the
outward
and
the
inward
,
that
painful
collisions
come
of
it
.
    
<EOS>
Tending
to
Refute
the
Popular
Prejudice
against
the
Present
of
a
Pocket
-
Knife
  
<EOS>
In
that
dark
time
of
December
,
the
sale
of
the
household
furniture
lasted
beyond
the
middle
of
the
second
day
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
,
who
had
begun
,
in
his
intervals
of
consciousness
,
to
manifest
an
irritability
which
often
appeared
to
have
as
a
direct
effect
the
recurrence
of
spasmodic
rigidity
and
insensibility
,
had
lain
in
this
living
death
throughout
the
critical
hours
when
the
noise
of
the
sale
came
nearest
to
his
chamber
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
had
decided
that
it
would
be
a
less
risk
to
let
him
remain
where
he
was
than
to
remove
him
to
Luke
's
cottage
,
 
a
plan
which
the
good
Luke
had
proposed
to
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
thinking
it
would
be
very
bad
if
the
master
were
"
to
waken
up
"
at
the
noise
of
the
sale
;
and
the
wife
and
children
had
sat
imprisoned
in
the
silent
chamber
,
watching
the
large
prostrate
figure
on
the
bed
,
and
trembling
lest
the
blank
face
should
suddenly
show
some
response
to
the
sounds
which
fell
on
their
own
ears
with
such
obstinate
,
painful
repetition
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
over
at
last
,
that
time
of
importunate
certainty
and
eye
-
straining
suspense
.
<EOS>
The
sharp
sound
of
a
voice
,
almost
as
metallic
as
the
rap
that
followed
it
,
had
ceased
;
the
tramping
of
footsteps
on
the
gravel
had
died
out
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
blond
face
seemed
aged
ten
years
by
the
last
thirty
hours
;
the
poor
woman
's
mind
had
been
busy
divining
when
her
favorite
things
were
being
knocked
down
by
the
terrible
hammer
;
her
heart
had
been
fluttering
at
the
thought
that
first
one
thing
and
then
another
had
gone
to
be
identified
as
hers
in
the
hateful
publicity
of
the
Golden
Lion
;
and
all
the
while
she
had
to
sit
and
make
no
sign
of
this
inward
agitation
.
<EOS>
Such
things
bring
lines
in
well
-
rounded
faces
,
and
broaden
the
streaks
of
white
among
the
hairs
that
once
looked
as
if
they
had
been
dipped
in
pure
sunshine
.
<EOS>
Already
,
at
three
o'clock
,
Kezia
,
the
good
-
hearted
,
bad
-
tempered
housemaid
,
who
regarded
all
people
that
came
to
the
sale
as
her
personal
enemies
,
the
dirt
on
whose
feet
was
of
a
peculiarly
vile
quality
,
had
begun
to
scrub
and
swill
with
an
energy
much
assisted
by
a
continual
low
muttering
against
"
folks
as
came
to
buy
up
other
folk
's
things
,
"
and
made
light
of
"
scrazing
"
the
tops
of
mahogany
tables
over
which
better
folks
than
themselves
had
had
to
 
suffer
a
waste
of
tissue
through
evaporation
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
scrubbing
indiscriminately
,
for
there
would
be
further
dirt
of
the
same
atrocious
kind
made
by
people
who
had
still
to
fetch
away
their
purchases
;
but
she
was
bent
on
bringing
the
parlor
,
where
that
"
pipe
-
smoking
pig
,
"
the
bailiff
,
had
sat
,
to
such
an
appearance
of
scant
comfort
as
could
be
given
to
it
by
cleanliness
and
the
few
articles
of
furniture
bought
in
for
the
family
.
<EOS>
Her
mistress
and
the
young
folks
should
have
their
tea
in
it
that
night
,
Kezia
was
determined
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
between
five
and
six
o'clock
,
near
the
usual
teatime
,
when
she
came
upstairs
and
said
that
Master
Tom
was
wanted
.
<EOS>
The
person
who
wanted
him
was
in
the
kitchen
,
and
in
the
first
moments
,
by
the
imperfect
fire
and
candle
light
,
Tom
had
not
even
an
indefinite
sense
of
any
acquaintance
with
the
rather
broad
-
set
but
active
figure
,
perhaps
two
years
older
than
himself
,
that
looked
at
him
with
a
pair
of
blue
eyes
set
in
a
disc
of
freckles
,
and
pulled
some
curly
red
locks
with
a
strong
intention
of
respect
.
<EOS>
A
low
-
crowned
oilskin
-
covered
hat
,
and
a
certain
shiny
deposit
of
dirt
on
the
rest
of
the
costume
,
as
of
tablets
prepared
for
writing
upon
,
suggested
a
calling
that
had
to
do
with
boats
;
but
this
did
not
help
Tom
's
memory
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sarvant
,
Master
Tom
,
"
said
he
of
the
red
locks
,
with
a
smile
which
seemed
to
break
through
a
self
-
imposed
air
of
melancholy
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
me
again
,
I
doubt
,
"
he
went
on
,
as
Tom
continued
to
look
at
him
inquiringly
;
"
but
I
'd
like
to
talk
to
you
by
yourself
a
bit
,
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
fire
<EOS>
i
'
the
parlor
,
Master
Tom
,
"
said
Kezia
,
who
objected
to
leaving
the
kitchen
in
the
crisis
of
toasting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
this
way
,
then
,
"
said
Tom
,
wondering
if
this
young
fellow
belonged
to
Guest
&
Co.
's
Wharf
,
for
his
imagination
ran
continually
toward
that
particular
spot
;
and
uncle
Deane
might
any
time
be
sending
for
him
to
say
that
there
was
a
situation
at
liberty
.
  
<EOS>
The
bright
fire
in
the
parlor
was
the
only
light
that
showed
the
few
chairs
,
the
bureau
,
the
carpetless
floor
,
and
the
one
table
 
<EOS>
no
,
not
the
_
one
_
table
;
there
was
a
second
table
,
in
a
corner
,
with
a
large
Bible
and
a
few
other
books
upon
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
this
new
strange
bareness
that
Tom
felt
first
,
before
he
thought
of
looking
again
at
the
face
which
was
also
lit
up
by
the
fire
,
and
which
stole
a
half
-
shy
,
questioning
glance
at
him
as
the
entirely
strange
voice
said
:
  
"
<EOS>
Why
!
<EOS>
you
do
n't
remember
Bob
,
then
,
as
you
gen
the
pocket
-
knife
to
,
Mr.
Tom
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
rough
-
handled
pocket
-
knife
was
taken
out
in
the
same
moment
,
and
the
largest
blade
opened
by
way
of
irresistible
demonstration
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
Bob
Jakin
?
"
said
Tom
,
not
with
any
cordial
delight
,
for
he
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
that
early
intimacy
symbolized
by
the
pocket
-
knife
,
and
was
not
at
all
sure
that
Bob
's
motives
for
recalling
it
were
entirely
admirable
.
  
<EOS>

"
  
<EOS>
Bob
spoke
with
a
sharp
and
rather
treble
volubility
,
and
got
through
his
long
speech
with
surprising
despatch
,
giving
the
blade
of
his
knife
an
affectionate
rub
on
his
sleeve
when
he
had
finished
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Bob
,
"
said
Tom
,
with
a
slight
air
of
patronage
,
the
foregoing
reminscences
having
disposed
him
to
be
as
friendly
as
was
becoming
,
though
there
was
no
part
of
his
acquaintance
with
Bob
that
he
remembered
better
than
the
cause
of
their
parting
quarrel
;
"
is
there
anything
I
can
do
for
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
no
,
Mr.
Tom
,
"
answered
Bob
,
shutting
up
his
knife
with
a
click
and
returning
it
to
his
pocket
,
where
he
seemed
to
be
feeling
for
something
else
.
<EOS>
"

"
  
<EOS>
Bob
had
drawn
out
a
dirty
canvas
bag
,
and
would
perhaps
not
have
paused
just
then
if
Maggie
had
not
entered
the
room
and
darted
a
look
of
surprise
and
curiosity
at
him
,
whereupon
he
pulled
his
red
locks
again
with
due
respect
.
<EOS>
But
the
next
moment
the
sense
of
the
altered
room
came
upon
Maggie
with
a
force
that
overpowered
the
thought
of
Bob
's
presence
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
had
immediately
glanced
from
him
to
the
place
where
the
bookcase
had
hung
;
there
was
nothing
now
but
the
oblong
unfaded
space
on
the
wall
,
and
below
it
the
small
table
with
the
Bible
and
the
few
other
books
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Tom
!
"
she
burst
out
,
clasping
her
hands
,
"
where
are
the
books
?
<EOS>
I
thought
my
uncle
Glegg
said
he
would
buy
them
.
<EOS>
Did
n't
he
?
<EOS>
Are
those
all
they
've
left
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
,
"
said
Tom
,
with
a
sort
of
desperate
indifference
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
they
buy
many
books
when
they
bought
so
little
furniture
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
,
Tom
,
"
said
Maggie
,
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
,
as
she
rushed
up
to
the
table
to
see
what
books
had
been
rescued
.
<EOS>
"
Our
dear
old
Pilgrim
's
Progress
that
you
colored
with
your
little
paints
;
and
that
picture
of
Pilgrim
with
a
mantle
on
,
looking
just
like
a
turtle
 
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Maggie
went
on
,
half
sobbing
as
she
turned
over
the
few
books
,
"
I
thought
we
should
never
part
with
that
while
we
lived
;
everything
is
going
away
from
us
;
the
end
of
our
lives
will
have
nothing
in
it
like
the
beginning
!
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
turned
away
from
the
table
and
threw
herself
into
a
chair
,
with
the
big
tears
ready
to
roll
down
her
cheeks
,
quite
blinded
to
the
presence
of
Bob
,
who
was
looking
at
her
with
the
pursuant
gaze
of
an
intelligent
dumb
animal
,
with
perceptions
more
perfect
than
his
comprehension
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Bob
,
"
said
Tom
,
feeling
that
the
subject
of
the
books
was
unseasonable
,
"
I
suppose
you
just
came
to
see
me
because
we
're
in
trouble
?
<EOS>
That
was
very
good
-
natured
of
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
how
it
is
,
Master
Tom

said
Bob
,
beginning
to
untwist
his
canvas
bag
.
<EOS>
"
You
see

I'n
been
with

<EOS>
But
a
fortni't
ago
I
'd
a
rare
bit
o
'
luck
<EOS>
,
 
I
allays
thought
I
was
a
lucky
chap
,
for
I
niver
set
a
trap
<EOS>
but
what
I
catched
something
;
but
this
was
n't
trap

it
was
a
fire

i

Torry

Here

"
<EOS>
Here
Bob
emptied
the
canvas
bag
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
'
when
I
'd
got
'em
,
my
head
was
all
of
a
boil
like
a
kettle
o
'
broth
,
thinkin
'
<EOS>
what
sort
o
'
life
<EOS>
I
should
take
to
,
for
there
war
a
many
trades
I
'd
thought
on
;
for
as
for
the
barge
,
I
'm
clean
tired
out
wi't
,
for
it
pulls
the
days
out
till
they
're
as
long
as
pigs

chitterlings

<EOS>
An
'
I
thought
first
I
'd
ha
'
ferrets
an
'
dogs
<EOS>
,
an
'
be
a
rat

catcher
;
an
'
then
I
thought
as
I
should
like
a
bigger
way
o
'
<EOS>
life
,
as
I
did
n't
know
so
well
;
for
I'n
seen
to
the
bottom
o
'
rat

catching
<EOS>
;
an
'
I
thought
,
an
'
thought
,
till
at
last
I
settled
I
'd
be
a
packman
,
 
<EOS>
for
they
're
knowin

fellers

the
packmen
are
,
 
<EOS>
an
'
I
'd
carry
the
lightest
things
<EOS>
I
could
<EOS>
i

my
pack

an
'
there
'd
be
a
use
for
a
feller
's
tongue
,
as
is
no
use
neither
wi
'
rats
nor
barges

<EOS>
An
'
I
should
go
about
the
country
<EOS>
far

wide
,
an

come
round
the

<EOS>
Bob
paused
,
and
then
said
,
with
defiant
decision
,
as
if
resolutely
turning
his
back
on
that
paradisaic
picture
:
  
"
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
mind
about
it
,
not
a

<EOS>
An

I'n
changed
one
o

the
suvreigns
to
buy
my
mother
a
goose
for
dinner
,
an
'
I'n
bought
a
blue

meant
to

respectable

Tom
was
touched
keenly
enough
to
forget
his
pride
and
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
very
kind
fellow

Bob

he
said
,
coloring
,
with
that
little
diffident
tremor
in
his
voice
which
gave
a
certain
charm
even
to
Tom
's
pride

severity

Would

said
Bob
,
regretfully
.
<EOS>
"
Now

<EOS>
Bob
pushed
the
sovereigns
forward
,
but
before
Tom
could
speak
Maggie
,
clasping
her
hands
,
and
looking
penitently
at
Bob
,
said
:
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
'm
so
sorry

<EOS>
Bob
;
I
never
thought

so
good

Why

I
think
you
're
the
kindest
person
in

"
  
<EOS>
Bob
had
not
been
aware
of
the
injurious
opinion
for
which
Maggie
was
performing
an
inward
act
of
penitence
,
but
he
smiled
with
pleasure
at
this
handsome
eulogy
,
 
especially
from
a
young
lass
who
,
as
he
informed
his
mother
that
evening
,
had
"
such
uncommon
eyes
<EOS>
,
they
looked
somehow
as
they
made
him
feel
nohow
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
indeed
Bob
,
I
ca
n't
take
them
,
"
said
Tom
;
"
but
do
n't
think
I
feel
your
kindness
less
because
I
say
no

<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
take
anything
from
anybody

to
work
my

And
those
sovereigns

much

they
would

<EOS>
Let
me
shake
hands

you

<EOS>
Tom
put
out
his
pink
palm
,
and
Bob
was
not
slow
to
place
his
hard
,
grimy
hand
within
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
put
the
sovereigns
in

said
Maggie

said
Bob

with
an
air
of
discontent

as
Maggie
gave
him
the
bag
again

How

Takes
to
Stratagem
  
<EOS>
The
days
passed
,
and
Mr.
Tulliver
showed
,
at
least
to
the
eyes
of
the
medical
man
,
stronger
and
stronger
symptoms
of
a
gradual
return
to
his
normal
condition
;
the
paralytic
obstruction
was
,
little
by
little
,
losing
its
tenacity
,
and
the
mind
was
rising
from
under
it
with
fitful
struggles
,
like
a
living
creature
making
its
way
from
under
a
great
snowdrift
,
that
slides
and
slides
again
,
and
shuts
up
the
newly
made
opening

<EOS>
Time
would
have
seemed
to
creep
to
the
watchers
by
the
bed
,
if
it
had
only
been
measured
by
the
doubtful
,
distant
hope
which
kept
count
of
the
moments
within
the
chamber
;
but
it
was
measured
for
them
by
a
fast
-
approaching
dread
which
made
the
nights
come
too
quickly
.
<EOS>
While
Mr.
Tulliver
was
slowly
becoming
himself
again
,
his
lot
was
hastening
toward
its
moment
of
most
palpable
change
.
<EOS>
The
taxing
-
masters
had
done
their
work
like
any
respectable
gunsmith
conscientiously
preparing
the
musket
,
that
,
duly
pointed
by
a
brave
arm
,
will
spoil
a
life
or
two

Allocaturs

filing

legal
chain

shot
or

shells
that
can
never
hit
a
solitary
mark

but
must
fall
with
widespread
shattering
.
<EOS>
So
deeply
inherent
is
it
in
this
life
of
ours
that
men
have
to
suffer
for
each
other
's
sins
,
<EOS>
so
inevitably
diffusive
is
human
suffering
,
that
even
justice
makes
its
victims
,
and
we
can
conceive
no
retribution
that
does
not
spread
beyond
its
mark
in
pulsations
of
unmerited
pain
.
  
<EOS>
By
the
beginning
of
the
second
week
in
January
,
the
bills
were
out
advertising
the
sale
,
under
a
decree
of
Chancery
,
of
Mr.
Tulliver
's
farming
and
other
stock
,
to
be
followed
by
a
sale
of
the
mill
and
land
,
held
in
the
proper
after
-
dinner
hour
at
the
Golden
Lion
.
<EOS>
The
miller
himself
,
unaware
of
the
lapse
of
time
,
fancied
himself
still
in
that
first
stage
of
his
misfortunes
when
expedients
might
be
thought
of
;
and
often
in
his
conscious
hours
talked
in
a
feeble
,
disjointed
manner
of
plans
he
would
carry
out
when
he
"
got
well
.
"
<EOS>
The
wife
and
children
were
not
without
hope
of
an
issue
that
would
at
least
save
Mr.
Tulliver
from
leaving
the
old
spot
,
and
seeking
an
entirely
strange
life
.
<EOS>
For
uncle
Deane
had
been
induced
to
interest
himself
in
this
stage
of
the
business
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
,
he
acknowledged
,
be
a
bad
speculation
for
Guest
&
Co.
to
buy
Dorlcote
Mill
,
and
carry
on
the
business
,
which
was
a
good
one
,
and
might
be
increased
by
the
addition
of
steam
power
;
in
which
case
Tulliver
might
be
retained
as
manager
.
<EOS>
Still
,
Mr.
Deane
would
say
nothing
decided
about
the
matter
;
the
fact
that
Wakem
held
the
mortgage
on
the
land
might
put
it
into
his
head
to
bid
for
the
whole
estate
,
and
further
,
to
outbid
the
cautious
firm
of
Guest
&
co.
,
who
did
not
carry
on
business
on
sentimental
grounds
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
was
obliged
to
tell
Mrs.
Tulliver
something
to
that
effect
,
when
he
rode
over
to
the
mill
to
inspect
the
books
in
company
with
Mrs.
Glegg
;
for
she
had
observed
that
"
if
Guest
&
co.
would
only
think
about
it
,
Mr.
Tulliver
's
father
and
grandfather
had
been
carrying
on
Dorlcote
Mill
long
before
the
oil
-
mill
of
that
firm
had
been
so
much
as
thought
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
,
in
reply
,
doubted
whether
that
was
precisely
the
relation
between
the
two
mills
which
would
determine
their
value
as
investments
.
<EOS>
As
for
uncle
Glegg
,
the
thing
lay
quite
beyond
his
imagination
;
the
good
-
natured
man
felt
sincere
pity
for
the
Tulliver
family
,
but
his
money
was
all
locked
up
in
excellent
mortgages
,
and
he
could
run
no
risk
;
that
would
be
unfair
to
his
own
relatives
;
but
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
Tulliver
should
have
some
new
flannel
waistcoats
which
he
had
himself
renounced
in
favor
of
a
more
elastic
commodity
,
and
that
he
would
buy
Mrs.
Tulliver
a
pound
of
tea
now
and
then
;
it
would
be
a
journey
which
his
benevolence
delighted
in
beforehand
,
to
carry
the
tea
and
see
her
pleasure
on
being
assured
it
was
the
best
black
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
it
was
clear
that
Mr.
Deane
was
kindly
disposed
toward
the
Tullivers
.
<EOS>
One
day
he
had
brought
Lucy
,
who
was
come
home
for
the
Christmas
holidays
,
and
the
little
blond
angel
-
head
had
pressed
itself
against
Maggie
's
darker
cheek
with
many
kisses
and
some
tears
.
<EOS>
These
fair
slim
daughters
keep
up
a
tender
spot
in
the
heart
of
many
a
respectable
partner
in
a
respectable
firm
,
and
perhaps
Lucy
's
anxious
,
pitying
questions
about
her
poor
cousins
helped
to
make
uncle
Deane
more
prompt
in
finding
Tom
a
temporary
place
in
the
warehouse
,
and
in
putting
him
in
the
way
of
getting
evening
lessons
in
book
-
keeping
and
calculation
.
  
<EOS>
That
might
have
cheered
the
lad
and
fed
his
hopes
a
little
,
if
there
had
not
come
at
the
same
time
the
much
-
dreaded
blow
of
finding
that
his
father
must
be
a
bankrupt
,
after
all
;
at
least
,
the
creditors
must
be
asked
to
take
less
than
their
due
,
which
to
Tom
's
untechnical
mind
<EOS>
was
the
same
thing
as
bankruptcy
.
<EOS>
His
father
must
not
only
be
said
to
have
"
lost
his
property
,
"
but
to
have
"
failed
,
"
 
the
word
that
carried
the
worst
obloquy
to
Tom
's
mind
.
<EOS>
For
when
the
defendant
's
claim
for
costs
had
been
satisfied
,
there
would
remain
the
friendly
bill
of
Mr.
Gore
,
and
the
deficiency
at
the
bank
,
as
well
as
the
other
debts
which
would
make
the
assets
shrink
into
unequivocal
disproportion
;
"
not
more
than
ten
or
twelve
shillings
in
the
pound
,
"
predicted
Mr.
Deane
,
in
a
decided
tone
,
tightening
his
lips
;
and
the
words
fell
on
Tom
like
a
scalding
liquied
,
leaving
a
continual
smart
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
sadly
in
want
of
something
to
keep
up
his
spirits
a
little
in
the
unpleasant
newness
of
his
position
,
 
suddenly
transported
from
the
easy
carpeted
_
ennui
_
of
study
-
hours
at
Mr.
Stelling
's
,
and
the
busy
idleness
of
castle
-
building
in
a
"
last
half
"
at
school
,
to
the
companionship
of
sacks
and
hides
,
and
bawling
men
thundering
down
heavy
weights
at
his
elbow
.
<EOS>
The
first
step
toward
getting
on
in
the
world
was
a
chill
,
dusty
,
noisy
affair
,
and
implied
going
without
one
's
tea
in
order
to
stay
in
St.
Ogg
's
and
have
an
evening
lesson
from
a
one
-
armed
elderly
clerk
,
in
a
room
smelling
strongly
of
bad
tobacco
.
<EOS>
Tom
's
young
pink
-
and
-
white
face
had
its
colors
very
much
deadened
by
the
time
he
took
off
his
hat
at
home
,
and
sat
down
with
keen
hunger
to
his
supper
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
he
was
a
little
cross
if
his
mother
or
Maggie
spoke
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
all
this
while
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
brooding
over
a
scheme
by
which
she
,
and
no
one
else
,
would
avert
the
result
most
to
be
dreaded
,
and
prevent
Wakem
from
entertaining
the
purpose
of
bidding
for
the
mill
.
<EOS>
Imagine
a
truly
respectable
and
amiable
hen
,
by
some
portentous
anomaly
,
taking
to
reflection
and
inventing
combinations
by
which
she
might
prevail
on
Hodge
not
to
wring
her
neck
,
or
send
her
and
her
chicks
to
market
;
the
result
could
hardly
be
other
than
much
cackling
and
fluttering
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
seeing
that
everything
had
gone
wrong
,
had
begun
to
think
she
had
been
too
passive
in
life
;
and
that
,
if
she
had
applied
her
mind
to
business
,
and
taken
a
strong
resolution
now
and
then
,
it
would
have
been
all
the
better
for
her
and
her
family
.
<EOS>
Nobody
,
it
appeared
,
had
thought
of
going
to
speak
to
Wakem
on
this
business
of
the
mill
;
and
yet
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
reflected
,
it
would
have
been
quite
the
shortest
method
of
securing
the
right
end
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
of
no
use
,
to
be
sure
,
for
Mr.
Tulliver
to
go
,
 
even
if
he
had
been
able
and
willing
,
 
for
he
had
been
"
going
to
law
against
Wakem
"
and
abusing
him
for
the
last
ten
years
;
Wakem
was
always
likely
to
have
a
spite
against
him
.
<EOS>
And
now
that
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
her
husband
was
very
much
in
the
wrong
to
bring
her
into
this
trouble
,
she
was
inclined
to
think
that
his
opinion
of
Wakem
was
wrong
too
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
Wakem
had
"
put
the
bailies
in
the
house
,
and
sold
them
up
"
;
but
she
supposed
he
did
that
to
please
the
man
that
lent
Mr.
Tulliver
the
money
,
for
a
lawyer
had
more
folks
to
please
than
one
,
and
he
was
n't
likely
to
put
Mr.
Tulliver
,
who
had
gone
to
law
with
him
,
above
everybody
else
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
The
attorney
might
be
a
very
reasonable
man
;
why
not
?
<EOS>
He
had
married
a
Miss
Clint
,
and
at
the
time
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
heard
of
that
marriage
,
the
summer
when
she
wore
her
blue
satin
spencer
,
and
had
not
yet
any
thoughts
of
Mr.
Tulliver
,
she
knew
no
harm
of
Wakem
.
<EOS>
And
certainly
toward
herself
,
whom
he
knew
to
have
been
a
Miss
Dodson
<EOS>
,
it
was
out
of
all
possibility
that
he
could
entertain
anything
but
good
-
will
,
when
it
was
once
brought
home
to
his
observation
that
she
,
for
her
part
,
had
never
wanted
to
go
to
law
,
and
indeed
was
at
present
disposed
to
take
Mr.
Wakem
's
view
of
all
subjects
rather
than
her
husband
's
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
if
that
attorney
saw
a
respectable
matron
like
herself
disposed
"
to
give
him
good
words
,
"
why
should
n't
he
listen
to
her
representations
?
<EOS>
For
she
would
put
the
matter
clearly
before
him
,
which
had
never
been
done
yet
.
<EOS>
And
he
would
never
go
and
bid
for
the
mill
on
purpose
to
spite
her
,
an
innocent
woman
,
who
thought
it
likely
enough
that
she
had
danced
with
him
in
their
youth
at
Squire
Darleigh
's
,
for
at
those
big
dances
she
had
often
and
often
danced
with
young
men
whose
names
she
had
forgotten
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
hid
these
reasonings
in
her
own
bosom
;
for
when
she
had
thrown
out
a
hint
to
Mr.
Deane
and
Mr.
Glegg
that
she
would
n't
mind
going
to
speak
to
Wakem
herself
,
they
had
said
,
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
and
"
Pooh
,
pooh
,
"
and
"
Let
Wakem
alone
,
"
in
the
tone
of
men
who
were
not
likely
to
give
a
candid
attention
to
a
more
definite
exposition
of
her
project
;
still
less
dared
she
mention
the
plan
to
Tom
and
Maggie
,
for
"
the
children
were
always
so
against
everything
their
mother
said
"
;
and
Tom
,
she
observed
,
was
almost
as
much
set
against
Wakem
as
his
father
was
.
<EOS>
But
this
unusual
concentration
of
thought
naturally
gave
Mrs.
Tulliver
an
unusual
power
of
device
and
determination
:
and
a
day
or
two
before
the
sale
,
to
be
held
at
the
Golden
Lion
,
when
there
was
no
longer
any
time
to
be
lost
,
she
carried
out
her
plan
by
a
stratagem
.
<EOS>
There
were
pickles
in
question
,
a
large
stock
of
pickles
and
ketchup
which
Mrs.
Tulliver
possessed
,
and
which
Mr.
Hyndmarsh
,
the
grocer
,
would
certainly
purchase
if
she
could
transact
the
business
in
a
personal
interview
,
so
she
would
walk
with
Tom
to
St.
Ogg
's
that
morning
;
and
when
Tom
urged
that
she
might
let
the
pickles
be
at
present
,
 
he
did
n't
like
her
to
go
about
just
yet
<EOS>
,
 
<EOS>
she
appeared
so
hurt
at
this
conduct
in
her
son
,
contradicting
her
about
pickles
which
she
had
made
after
the
family
receipts
inherited
from
his
own
grandmother
,
who
had
died
when
his
mother
was
a
little
girl
,
that
he
gave
way
,
and
they
walked
together
until
she
turned
toward
Danish
Street
,
where
Mr.
Hyndmarsh
retailed
his
grocery
,
not
far
from
the
offices
of
Mr.
Wakem
.
  
<EOS>
That
gentleman
was
not
yet
come
to
his
office
;
would
Mrs.
Tulliver
sit
down
by
the
fire
in
his
private
room
and
wait
for
him
?
<EOS>
She
had
not
long
to
wait
before
the
punctual
attorney
entered
,
knitting
his
brow
with
an
examining
glance
at
the
stout
blond
woman
who
rose
,
curtsying
deferentially
,
 
a
tallish
man
,
with
an
aquiline
nose
and
abundant
iron
-
gray
hair
.
<EOS>
You
have
never
seen
Mr.
Wakem
before
,
and
are
possibly
wondering
whether
he
was
really
as
eminent
a
rascal
,
and
as
crafty
,
bitter
an
enemy
of
honest
humanity
in
general
,
and
of
Mr.
Tulliver
in
particular
,
as
he
is
represented
to
be
in
that
eidolon
or
portrait
of
him
which
we
have
seen
to
exist
in
the
miller
's
mind
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
clear
that
the
irascible
miller
was
a
man
to
interpret
any
chance
-
shot
that
grazed
him
as
an
attempt
on
his
own
life
,
and
was
liable
to
entanglements
in
this
puzzling
world
,
which
,
due
consideration
had
to
his
own
infallibility
,
required
the
hypothesis
of
a
very
active
diabolical
agency
to
explain
them
.
<EOS>
It
is
still
possible
to
believe
that
the
attorney
was
not
more
guilty
toward
him
than
an
ingenious
machine
,
which
performs
its
work
with
much
regularity
,
is
guilty
toward
the
rash
man
who
,
venturing
too
near
it
,
is
caught
up
by
some
fly
-
wheel
or
other
,
and
suddenly
converted
into
unexpected
mince
-
meat
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
is
really
impossible
to
decide
this
question
by
a
glance
at
his
person
;
the
lines
and
lights
of
the
human
countenance
are
like
other
symbols
,
 
not
always
easy
to
read
without
a
key
.
<EOS>
On
an
_
a
priori
_
view
of
Wakem
's
aquiline
nose
,
which
offended
Mr.
Tulliver
,
there
was
not
more
rascality
than
in
the
shape
of
his
stiff
shirt
-
collar
,
though
this
too
along
with
his
nose
,
might
have
become
fraught
with
damnatory
meaning
when
once
the
rascality
was
ascertained
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
I
think
?
"
said
Mr.
Wakem
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
;
Miss
Elizabeth
Dodson
as
was
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
be
seated
.
<EOS>
You
have
some
business
with
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
yes
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
beginning
to
feel
alarmed
at
her
own
courage
<EOS>
,
now
she
was
really
in
presence
of
the
formidable
man
,
and
reflecting
that
she
had
not
settled
with
herself
how
she
should
begin
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wakem
felt
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
,
and
looked
at
her
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
sir
,
"
she
began
at
last
,
 
"
I
hope
,
<EOS>
sir
,
you
're
not
a
-
thinking
as
_
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
_
bear
you
<EOS>
any
ill
-
will
because
o
'
my
husband
's
losing
his
lawsuit
,
and
the
bailies
being
put
in
,
and
the
linen
being
sold
,
 
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
 
<EOS>
for
I
was
n't
brought
up
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
you
remember
my
father
,
sir
,
for
he
was
close
friends
with
Squire
Darleigh
,
and
we
allays
went
to
the
dances
there
,
the
Miss
Dodsons
,
 
nobody
could
be
more
looked
on
,
 
and
justly
,
for
there
was
four
of
us
,
and
you
're
quite
aware
as
Mrs.
Glegg
and
Mrs.
Deane
are
my
sisters
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
going
to
law
and
losing
money
,
and
having
sales
before
you
're
dead
,
I
never
saw
anything
o
'
that
before
I
was
married
,
nor
for
a
long
while
after
.
<EOS>
And
I
'm
not
to
be
answerable
for
my
bad
luck
<EOS>
i
'
marrying
out
o
'
my
own
family
into
one
where
the
goings
-
on
was
different
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
being
drawn
in
t
"
abuse
you
as
other
folks
abuse
you
,
sir
,
_
that
_
I
niver
was
,
and
nobody
can
say
it
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
shook
her
head
a
little
,
and
looked
at
the
hem
of
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
no
doubt
of
what
you
say
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
"
said
Mr.
Wakem
,
with
cold
politeness
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
some
question
to
ask
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
yes
.
<EOS>
But
that
's
what
I
've
said
to
myself
,
 
<EOS>
I
've
said
you
'd
had
some
nat'ral
feeling
;
and
as
for
my
husband
,
as
has
n't
been
himself
for
this
two
months
,
I
'm
not
a
-
defending
him
,
in
no
way
,
for
being
so
hot
about
th
'
erigation
,
 
not
but
what
there
's
worse
men
,
for
he
never
wronged
nobody
of
a
shilling
nor
a
penny
,
not
willingly
;
and
as
for
his
fieriness
and
lawing
,
what
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
And
him
struck
as
if
it
was
with
death
when
he
got
the
letter
as
said
you
'd
<EOS>
the
hold
upo
'
the
land
.
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
believe
but
<EOS>
what
you
'll
behave
as
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
all
this
mean
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
?
"
said
Mr.
Wakem
rather
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
to
ask
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
if
you
'll
be
so
good
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
starting
a
little
,
and
speaking
more
hurriedly
,
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
'll
be
so
good
not
to
buy
the
mill
an
'
the
land
,
 
the
land
would
n't
so
much
matter
,
only
my
husband
ull
'
be
like
mad
at
your
having
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Something
like
a
new
thought
flashed
across
Mr.
Wakem
's
face
as
he
said
,
"
Who
told
you
I
meant
to
buy
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
it
's
none
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
my
inventing
,
and
I
should
never
ha
'
thought
of
it
;
for
my
husband
,
as
ought
to
know
about
the
law
<EOS>
,
he
allays
used
to
say
as
lawyers
had
never
no
call
to
buy
anything
,
 
either
lands
or
houses
,
 
<EOS>
for
they
allays
got
'em
into
their
hands
other
ways
.
<EOS>
An
'
I
should
think
that
'
ud
be
the
way
with
you
,
sir
;
and
I
niver
said
as
you
'd
be
the
man
to
do
contrairy
to
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
well
,
who
was
it
that
_
did
_
say
so
?
"
said
Wakem
,
opening
his
desk
,
and
moving
things
about
,
with
the
accompaniment
of
an
almost
inaudible
whistle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
it
was
Mr.
Glegg
and
Mr.
Deane
,
as
have
all
the
management
;
and
Mr.
Deane
thinks
as
Guest
&
co.
'
ud
buy
the
mill
and
let
Mr.
Tulliver
work
it
for
'em
,
if
you
did
n't
bid
for
it
and
raise
the
price
.
<EOS>
And
it
'
ud
be
such
a
thing
for
my
husband
to
stay
where
he
is
,
if
he
could
get
his
living
:
for
it
was
his
father
's
before
him
,
the
mill
was
,
and
his
grandfather
built
it
,
though
I
was
n't
fond
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
the
noise
of
it
,
when
first
I
was
married
,
for
there
was
no
mills
in
our
family
,
 
not
the
Dodson
's
,
 
and
if
I
'd
known
as
the
mills
had
so
much
to
do
with
the
law
,
it
would
n't
have
been
me
as
'
ud
have
been
the
first
Dodson
to
marry
one
;
but
I
went
into
it
blindfold
,
that
I
did
,
erigation
and
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
Guest
&
co.
would
keep
the
mill
in
their
own
hands
,
I
suppose
,
and
pay
your
husband
wages
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
sir
,
it
's
hard
to
think
of
,
"
said
poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
a
little
tear
making
its
way
,
"
as
my
husband
should
take
wage
.
<EOS>
But
it
'
ud
look
more
like
what
used
to
be
,
to
stay
at
the
mill
than
to
go
anywhere
else
;
and
if
you
'll
only
think
 
if
you
was
to
bid
for
the
mill
and
buy
it
,
my
husband
might
be
struck
worse
than
he
was
before
,
and
niver
get
better
again
as
he
's
getting
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
if
I
bought
the
mill
,
and
allowed
your
husband
to
act
as
my
manager
in
the
same
way
,
how
then
?
"
said
Mr.
Wakem
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sir
,
I
doubt
he
could
niver
be
got
to
do
it
,
not
if
the
very
mill
stood
still
to
beg
and
pray
of
him
.
<EOS>
For
your
name
's
like
poison
to
him
,
it
's
so
as
never
was
;
and
he
looks
upon
it
as
you
've
been
the
ruin
of
him
all
along
,
ever
since
you
set
the
law
on
him
about
the
road
through
the
meadow
,
 
<EOS>
that
's
eight
year
ago
,
and
he
's
been
going
on
ever
since
 
as
I
've
allays
told
him
he
was
wrong
   
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
's
a
pig
-
headed
,
foul
-
mouthed
fool
!
"
<EOS>
burst
out
Mr.
Wakem
,
forgetting
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
sir
!
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
frightened
at
a
result
so
different
from
the
one
she
had
fixed
her
mind
on
;
"
I
would
n't
wish
to
contradict
you
,
but
it
's
like
enough
he
's
changed
his
mind
with
this
illness
,
 
<EOS>
he
's
forgot
a
many
things
he
used
to
talk
about
.
<EOS>
And
you
would
n't
like
to
have
a
corpse
on
your
mind
,
if
he
was
to
die
;
and
they
_
do
_
say
as
it
's
allays
unlucky
when
Dorlcote
Mill
changes
hands
,
and
the
water
might
all
run
away
,
and
_
<EOS>
then
_
 
not
<EOS>
as
I
'm
wishing
you
any
ill
-
luck
,
sir
,
for
I
forgot
to
tell
you
as
I
remember
your
wedding
as
if
it
was
yesterday
;
Mrs.
Wakem
was
a
Miss
Clint
<EOS>
,
I
know
_
<EOS>
that
;
_
and
my
boy
,
as
there
is
n't
a
nicer
,
handsomer
,
straighter
boy
nowhere
,
went
to
school
with
your
son
   
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wakem
rose
,
opened
the
door
,
and
called
to
one
of
his
clerks
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
;
I
have
business
that
must
be
attended
to
;
and
I
think
there
is
nothing
more
necessary
to
be
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
if
you
_
would
_
bear
it
in
mind
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
rising
,
"
and
not
run
against
me
and
my
children
;
and
I
'm
not
denying
Mr.
Tulliver
's
been
in
the
wrong
,
but
he
's
been
punished
enough
,
and
there
's
worse
men
,
for
it
's
been
giving
to
other
folks
<EOS>
has
been
his
fault
.
<EOS>
He
's
done
nobody
any
harm
but
himself
and
his
family
,
 
the
more
's
the
pity
,
 
and
I
go
and
look
at
the
bare
shelves
every
day
,
and
think
where
all
my
things
used
to
stand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
I
'll
bear
it
in
mind
,
"
said
Mr.
Wakem
,
hastily
,
looking
toward
the
open
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
you
'd
please
not
to
say
as
I
've
been
to
speak
to
you
,
for
my
son
'
ud
be
very
angry
with
me
for
demeaning
myself
<EOS>
,
I
know
he
would
,
and
I
've
trouble
enough
without
being
scolded
by
my
children
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
voice
trembled
a
little
,
and
she
could
make
no
answer
to
the
attorney
's
"
good
morning
,
"
but
curtsied
and
walked
out
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Which
day
is
it
that
Dorlcote
Mill
is
to
be
sold
?
<EOS>
Where
's
the
bill
?
"
said
Mr.
Wakem
to
his
clerk
when
they
were
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Next
Friday
is
the
day
,
 
Friday
at
six
o'clock
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
just
run
to
Winship
's
the
auctioneer
,
and
see
if
he
's
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
have
some
business
for
him
;
ask
him
to
come
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
Although
,
when
Mr.
Wakem
entered
his
office
that
morning
,
he
had
had
no
intention
of
purchasing
Dorlcote
Mill
,
his
mind
was
already
made
up
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
suggested
to
him
several
determining
motives
,
and
his
mental
glance
was
very
rapid
;
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
can
be
prompt
without
being
rash
,
because
their
motives
run
in
fixed
tracks
,
and
they
have
no
need
to
reconcile
conflicting
aims
.
  
<EOS>
To
suppose
that
Wakem
had
the
same
sort
of
inveterate
hatred
toward
Tulliver
that
Tulliver
had
toward
him
would
be
like
supposing
that
a
pike
and
a
roach
can
look
at
each
other
from
a
similar
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
The
roach
necessarily
abhors
the
mode
in
which
the
pike
gets
his
living
,
and
the
pike
is
likely
to
think
nothing
further
even
of
the
most
indignant
roach
than
that
he
is
excellent
good
eating
;
it
could
only
be
when
the
roach
choked
him
that
the
pike
could
entertain
a
strong
personal
animosity
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Tulliver
had
ever
seriously
injured
or
thwarted
the
attorney
,
Wakem
would
not
have
refused
him
the
distinction
of
being
a
special
object
of
his
vindictiveness
.
<EOS>
But
when
Mr.
Tulliver
called
Wakem
a
rascal
at
the
market
dinner
-
table
,
the
attorneys
'
clients
were
not
a
whit
inclined
to
withdraw
their
business
from
him
;
and
if
,
when
Wakem
himself
happened
to
be
present
,
some
jocose
cattle
-
feeder
,
stimulated
by
opportunity
and
brandy
,
made
a
thrust
at
him
by
alluding
to
old
ladies
'
wills
,
he
maintained
perfect
<EOS>
_
sang
froid
_
,
and
knew
quite
well
that
the
majority
of
substantial
men
then
present
were
perfectly
contented
with
the
fact
that
"
Wakem
was
Wakem
"
;
that
is
to
say
,
a
man
who
always
knew
the
stepping
-
stones
that
would
carry
him
through
very
muddy
bits
of
practice
.
<EOS>
A
man
who
had
made
a
large
fortune
,
had
a
handsome
house
among
the
trees
at
Tofton
,
and
decidedly
the
finest
stock
of
port
-
wine
in
the
neighborhood
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
was
likely
to
feel
himself
on
a
level
with
public
opinion
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
not
sure
that
even
honest
Mr.
Tulliver
himself
,
with
his
general
view
of
law
as
a
cockpit
,
might
not
,
under
opposite
circumstances
,
have
seen
a
fine
appropriateness
in
the
truth
that
"
Wakem
was
Wakem
"
;
since
I
have
understood
from
persons
versed
in
history
,
that
mankind
is
not
disposed
to
look
narrowly
into
the
conduct
of
great
victors
when
their
victory
is
on
the
right
side
.
<EOS>
Tulliver
,
then
,
could
be
no
obstruction
to
Wakem
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
was
a
poor
devil
whom
the
lawyer
had
defeated
several
times
;
a
hot
-
tempered
fellow
,
who
would
always
give
you
a
handle
against
him
.
<EOS>
Wakem
's
conscience
was
not
uneasy
because
he
had
used
a
few
tricks
against
the
miller
;
why
should
he
hate
that
unsuccessful
plaintiff
,
that
pitiable
,
furious
bull
entangled
in
the
meshes
of
a
net
?
  
<EOS>
Still
,
among
the
various
excesses
to
which
human
nature
is
subject
,
moralists
have
never
numbered
that
of
being
too
fond
of
the
people
who
openly
revile
us
.
<EOS>
The
successful
Yellow
candidate
for
the
borough
of
Old
Topping
,
perhaps
,
feels
no
pursuant
meditative
hatred
toward
the
Blue
editor
who
consoles
his
subscribers
with
vituperative
rhetoric
against
Yellow
men
who
sell
their
country
,
and
are
the
demons
of
private
life
;
but
he
might
not
be
sorry
,
if
law
and
opportunity
favored
,
to
kick
that
Blue
editor
to
a
deeper
shade
of
his
favorite
color
.
<EOS>
Prosperous
men
take
a
little
vengeance
now
and
then
,
as
they
take
a
diversion
,
when
it
comes
easily
in
their
way
,
and
is
no
hindrance
to
business
;
and
such
small
unimpassioned
revenges
have
an
enormous
effect
in
life
,
running
through
all
degrees
of
pleasant
infliction
,
blocking
the
fit
men
out
of
places
,
and
blackening
characters
in
unpremeditated
talk
.
<EOS>
Still
more
,
to
see
people
who
have
been
only
insignificantly
offensive
to
us
reduced
in
life
and
humiliated
,
without
any
special
effort
of
ours
,
is
apt
to
have
a
soothing
,
flattering
influence
.
<EOS>
Providence
or
some
other
prince
of
this
world
,
it
appears
,
has
undertaken
the
task
of
retribution
for
us
;
and
really
,
by
an
agreeable
constitution
of
things
,
our
enemies
somehow
_
do
n't
_
prosper
.
  
<EOS>
Wakem
was
not
without
this
parenthetic
vindictiveness
toward
the
uncomplimentary
miller
;
and
now
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
put
the
notion
into
his
head
,
it
presented
itself
to
him
as
a
pleasure
to
do
the
very
thing
that
would
cause
Mr.
Tulliver
<EOS>
the
most
deadly
mortification
,
  
and
a
pleasure
of
a
complex
kind
,
not
made
up
of
crude
malice
,
but
mingling
with
it
the
relish
of
self
-
approbation
.
<EOS>
To
see
an
enemy
humiliated
gives
a
certain
contentment
,
but
this
is
jejune
compared
with
the
highly
blent
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
humiliated
by
your
benevolent
action
or
concession
on
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
That
is
a
sort
of
revenge
which
falls
into
the
scale
of
virtue
,
and
Wakem
was
not
without
an
intention
of
keeping
that
scale
respectably
filled
.
<EOS>
He
had
once
had
the
pleasure
of
putting
an
old
enemy
of
his
into
one
of
the
St.
Ogg
's
alms
-
houses
,
to
the
rebuilding
of
which
he
had
given
a
large
subscription
;
and
here
was
an
opportunity
of
providing
for
another
by
making
him
his
own
servant
.
<EOS>
Such
things
give
a
completeness
to
prosperity
,
and
contribute
elements
of
agreeable
consciousness
that
are
not
dreamed
of
by
that
short
-
sighted
,
overheated
vindictiveness
which
goes
out
its
way
to
wreak
itself
in
direct
injury
.
<EOS>
And
Tulliver
,
with
his
rough
tongue
filed
by
a
sense
of
obligation
,
would
make
a
better
servant
than
any
chance
-
fellow
who
was
cap
-
in
-
hand
for
a
situation
.
<EOS>
Tulliver
was
known
to
be
a
man
of
proud
honesty
,
and
Wakem
was
too
acute
not
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
honesty
.
<EOS>
He
was
given
too
observing
individuals
,
not
to
judging
of
them
according
to
maxims
,
and
no
one
knew
better
than
he
that
all
men
were
not
like
himself
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
intended
to
overlook
the
whole
business
of
land
and
mill
pretty
closely
;
he
was
fond
of
these
practical
rural
matters
.
<EOS>
But
there
were
good
reasons
for
purchasing
Dorlcote
Mill
,
quite
apart
from
any
benevolent
vengeance
on
the
miller
.
<EOS>
It
was
really
a
capital
investment
;
besides
,
Guest
&
co.
were
going
to
bid
for
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Guest
and
Mr.
Wakem
were
on
friendly
dining
terms
,
and
the
attorney
liked
to
predominate
over
a
ship
-
owner
and
mill
-
owner
who
was
a
little
too
loud
in
the
town
affairs
as
well
as
in
his
table
-
talk
.
<EOS>
For
Wakem
was
not
a
mere
man
of
business
;
he
was
considered
a
pleasant
fellow
in
the
upper
circles
of
St.
Ogg
's
 
chatted
amusingly
over
his
port
-
wine
,
did
a
little
amateur
farming
,
and
had
certainly
been
an
excellent
husband
and
father
;
at
church
,
when
he
went
there
,
he
sat
under
the
handsomest
of
mural
monuments
erected
to
the
memory
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Most
men
would
have
married
again
under
his
circumstances
,
but
he
was
said
to
be
more
tender
to
his
deformed
son
than
most
men
were
to
their
best
-
shapen
offspring
.
<EOS>
Not
that
Mr.
Wakem
had
not
other
sons
beside
Philip
;
but
toward
them
he
held
only
a
chiaroscuro
parentage
,
and
provided
for
them
in
a
grade
of
life
duly
beneath
his
own
.
<EOS>
In
this
fact
,
indeed
,
there
lay
the
clenching
motive
to
the
purchase
of
Dorlcote
Mill
.
<EOS>
While
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
talking
,
it
had
occurred
to
the
rapid
-
minded
lawyer
,
among
all
the
other
circumstances
of
the
case
,
that
this
purchase
would
,
in
a
few
years
to
come
,
furnish
a
highly
suitable
position
for
a
certain
favorite
lad
whom
he
meant
to
bring
on
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
These
were
the
mental
conditions
on
which
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
undertaken
to
act
persuasively
,
and
had
failed
;
a
fact
which
may
receive
some
illustration
from
the
remark
of
a
great
philosopher
,
that
fly
-
fishers
fail
in
preparing
their
bait
so
as
to
make
it
alluring
in
the
right
quarter
,
for
want
of
a
due
acquaintance
with
the
subjectivity
of
fishes
.
    
<EOS>
Daylight
on
the
Wreck
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
clear
frosty
January
day
on
which
Mr.
Tulliver
first
came
downstairs
.
<EOS>
The
bright
sun
on
the
chestnut
boughs
and
the
roofs
opposite
his
window
had
made
him
impatiently
declare
that
he
would
be
caged
up
no
longer
;
he
thought
everywhere
would
be
more
cheery
under
this
sunshine
than
his
bedroom
;
for
he
knew
nothing
of
the
bareness
below
,
which
made
the
flood
of
sunshine
importunate
,
as
if
it
had
an
unfeeling
pleasure
in
showing
the
empty
places
,
and
the
marks
where
well
-
known
objects
once
had
been
.
<EOS>
The
impression
on
his
mind
that
it
was
<EOS>
but
yesterday
when
he
received
the
letter
from
Mr.
Gore
was
so
continually
implied
in
his
talk
,
and
the
attempts
to
convey
to
him
the
idea
that
many
weeks
had
passed
and
much
had
happened
since
then
had
been
so
soon
swept
away
by
recurrent
forgetfulness
,
that
even
Mr.
Turnbull
had
begun
to
despair
of
preparing
him
to
meet
the
facts
by
previous
knowledge
.
<EOS>
The
full
sense
of
the
present
could
only
be
imparted
gradually
by
new
experience
,
 
not
by
mere
words
,
which
must
remain
weaker
than
the
impressions
left
by
the
_
old
_
experience
.
<EOS>
This
resolution
to
come
downstairs
was
heard
with
trembling
by
the
wife
and
children
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
said
Tom
must
not
go
to
St.
Ogg
's
at
the
usual
hour
,
he
must
wait
and
see
his
father
downstairs
;
and
Tom
complied
,
though
with
an
intense
inward
shrinking
from
the
painful
scene
.
<EOS>
The
hearts
of
all
three
had
been
more
deeply
dejected
than
ever
during
the
last
few
days
.
<EOS>
For
Guest
&
Co.
had
not
bought
the
mill
;
both
mill
and
land
had
been
knocked
down
to
Wakem
,
who
had
been
over
the
premises
,
and
had
laid
before
Mr.
Deane
and
Mr.
Glegg
,
in
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
presence
,
his
willingness
to
employ
Mr.
Tulliver
,
in
case
of
his
recovery
,
as
a
manager
of
the
business
.
<EOS>
This
proposition
had
occasioned
much
family
debating
.
<EOS>
Uncles
and
aunts
were
almost
unanimously
of
opinion
that
such
an
offer
ought
not
to
be
rejected
when
there
was
nothing
in
the
way
but
a
feeling
in
Mr.
Tulliver
's
mind
,
which
,
as
neither
aunts
nor
uncles
shared
it
,
was
regarded
as
entirely
unreasonable
and
childish
,
 
indeed
,
as
a
transferring
toward
Wakem
of
that
indignation
and
hatred
which
Mr.
Tulliver
ought
properly
to
have
directed
against
himself
for
his
general
quarrelsomeness
,
and
his
special
exhibition
of
it
in
going
to
law
.
<EOS>
Here
was
an
opportunity
for
Mr.
Tulliver
to
provide
for
his
wife
and
daughter
without
any
assistance
from
his
wife
's
relations
,
and
without
that
too
evident
descent
into
pauperism
which
makes
it
annoying
to
respectable
people
to
meet
the
degraded
member
of
the
family
by
the
wayside
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
,
Mrs.
Glegg
considered
,
must
be
made
to
feel
,
when
he
came
to
his
right
mind
,
that
he
could
never
humble
himself
enough
;
for
_
that
_
had
come
which
she
had
always
foreseen
would
come
of
his
insolence
in
time
past
"
to
them
as
were
the
best
friends
he
'd
got
to
look
to
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Glegg
and
Mr.
Deane
were
less
stern
in
their
views
,
but
they
both
of
them
thought
Tulliver
had
done
enough
harm
by
his
hot
-
tempered
crotchets
and
ought
to
put
them
out
of
the
question
when
a
livelihood
was
offered
him
;
Wakem
showed
a
right
feeling
about
the
matter
,
 
_
he
_
had
no
grudge
against
Tulliver
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
had
protested
against
entertaining
the
proposition
.
<EOS>
He
should
n't
like
his
father
to
be
under
Wakem
;
he
thought
it
would
look
mean
-
spirited
;
but
his
mother
's
main
distress
was
the
utter
impossibility
of
ever
"
turning
Mr.
Tulliver
round
about
Wakem
,
"
or
getting
him
to
hear
reason
;
no
,
they
would
all
have
to
go
and
live
in
a
pigsty
on
purpose
to
spite
Wakem
,
who
spoke
"
so
as
nobody
could
be
fairer
.
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
mind
was
reduced
to
such
confusion
by
living
in
this
strange
medium
of
unaccountable
sorrow
,
against
which
she
continually
appealed
by
asking
,
"
Oh
dear
,
what
_
have
_
I
done
to
deserve
worse
than
other
women
?
"
<EOS>
that
Maggie
began
to
suspect
her
poor
mother
's
wits
were
quite
going
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
"
she
said
,
when
they
were
out
of
their
father
's
room
together
,
"
we
_
must
_
try
to
make
father
understand
a
little
of
what
has
happened
before
he
goes
downstairs
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
get
my
mother
away
.
<EOS>
She
will
say
something
that
will
do
harm
.
<EOS>
Ask
Kezia
to
fetch
her
down
,
and
keep
her
engaged
with
something
in
the
kitchen
.
"
  
<EOS>
Kezia
was
equal
to
the
task
.
<EOS>
Having
declared
her
intention
of
staying
till
the
master
could
get
about
again
,
"
wage
or
no
wage
,
"
she
had
found
a
certain
recompense
in
keeping
a
strong
hand
over
her
mistress
,
scolding
her
for
"
moithering
"
herself
,
and
going
about
all
day
without
changing
her
cap
,
and
looking
as
if
she
was
"
mushed
.
"
<EOS>
Altogether
,
this
time
of
trouble
was
rather
a
Saturnalian
time
to
Kezia
;
she
could
scold
her
betters
with
unreproved
freedom
.
<EOS>
On
this
particular
occasion
there
were
drying
clothes
to
be
fetched
in
;
she
wished
to
know
if
one
pair
of
hands
could
do
everything
in
-
doors
and
out
,
and
observed
that
_
she
_
should
have
thought
it
would
be
good
for
Mrs.
Tulliver
to
put
on
her
bonnet
,
and
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
by
doing
that
needful
piece
of
work
.
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
went
submissively
downstairs
;
to
be
ordered
about
by
a
servant
was
the
last
remnant
of
her
household
dignities
,
 
she
would
soon
have
no
servant
to
scold
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
was
resting
in
his
chair
a
little
after
the
fatigue
of
dressing
,
and
Maggie
and
Tom
were
seated
near
him
,
when
Luke
entered
to
ask
if
he
should
help
master
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
Luke
<EOS>
;
stop
a
bit
,
sit
down
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
pointing
his
stick
toward
a
chair
,
and
looking
at
him
with
that
pursuant
gaze
which
convalescent
persons
often
have
for
those
who
have
tended
them
,
reminding
one
of
an
infant
gazing
about
after
its
nurse
.
<EOS>
For
Luke
had
been
a
constant
night
-
watcher
by
his
master
's
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
's
the
water
now
,
eh
,
Luke
?
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
"
Dix
has
n't
been
choking
you
up
again
,
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
it
's
all
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
I
thought
not
;
he
wo
n't
be
in
a
hurry
at
that
again
,
now
Riley
's
been
to
settle
him
.
<EOS>
That
was
what
I
said
to
Riley
yesterday
 
<EOS>
I
said
   
<EOS>
"
  
Mr.
Tulliver
leaned
forward
,
resting
his
elbows
on
the
armchair
,
and
looking
on
the
ground
as
if
in
search
of
something
,
striving
after
vanishing
images
like
a
man
struggling
against
a
doze
.
<EOS>
Maggie
looked
at
Tom
in
mute
distress
,
their
father
's
mind
was
so
far
off
the
present
,
which
would
by
-
and
-
by
thrust
itself
on
his
wandering
consciousness
!
<EOS>
Tom
was
almost
ready
to
rush
away
,
with
that
impatience
of
painful
emotion
which
makes
one
of
the
differences
between
youth
and
maiden
,
man
and
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
,
"
said
Maggie
,
laying
her
hand
on
his
,
"
do
n't
you
remember
that
Mr.
Riley
is
dead
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dead
?
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
sharply
,
looking
in
her
face
with
a
strange
,
examining
glance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
died
of
apoplexy
nearly
a
year

<EOS>
I
remember
hearing
you
say
you
had
to
pay
money
for
him
;
and
he
left
his
daughters
badly
off
;
one
of
them
is
under
-
teacher
at
Miss
Firniss
's
,
where
I
've
been
to
school
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
?
"
said
her
father
,
doubtfully
,
still
looking
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
But
as
soon
as
Tom
began
to
speak
he
turned
to
look
at
_
him
_
with
the
same
inquiring
glances
,
as
if
he
were
rather
surprised
at
the
presence
of
these
two
young
people
.
<EOS>
Whenever
his
mind
was
wandering
in
the
far
past
,
he
fell
into
this
oblivion
of
their
actual
faces
;
they
were
not
those
of
the
lad
and
the
little
wench
who
belonged
to
that
past
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
long
while
since
you
had
the
dispute
with
Dix
,
father
,
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
your
talking
about
it
three
years
ago
,
before
I
went
to
school
at
Mr.
Stelling
's
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
at
school
there
three
years
;
do
n't
you
remember
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
threw
himself
backward
again
,
losing
the
childlike
outward
glance
under
a
rush
of
new
ideas
,
which
diverted
him
from
external
impressions
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
minute
or
two
,
"
I
've
paid
a
deal
o
'
money
 
<EOS>
I
was
determined
my
son
should
have
a
good
eddication
;
I
'd
none
myself
,
and
I
've
felt
the
miss
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
he
'll
want
no
other
fortin
<EOS>
,
that
's
what
I
say
 
if
Wakem
was
to
get
the
better
of
me
again
   
"
  
<EOS>
The
thought
of
Wakem
roused
new
vibrations
,
and
after
a
moment
's
pause
he
began
to
look
at
the
coat
he
had
on
,
and
to
feel
in
his
side
-
pocket
.
<EOS>
Then
he
turned
to
Tom
,
and
said
in
his
old
sharp
way
,
"
Where
have
they
put
Gore
's
letter
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
close
at
hand
in
a
drawer
,
for
he
had
often
asked
for
it
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
there
is
in
the
letter
,
father
?
"
said
Tom
,
as
he
gave
it
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
I
do
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
rather
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
o
'
that
?
<EOS>
If
Furley
ca
n't
take
to
the
property
,
somebody
else
can
;
there
's
<EOS>
plenty
o
'
<EOS>
people
in
the
world
besides
Furley
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
hindering
 
my
not
being
well
 
go
and
tell
'em
to
get
the
horse
in
the
gig
,
<EOS>
Luke
;
I
can
get
down
to
St.
Ogg
's
well
enough
 
<EOS>
Gore
's
expecting
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
dear
father
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Maggie
burst
out
entreatingly
;
"
it
's
a
very
long
while
since
all
that
;
you
've
been
ill
a
great
many
weeks
,
 
more
than
two
months
;
everything
is
changed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
looked
at
them
all
three
alternately
with
a
startled
gaze
;
the
idea
that
much
had
happened
of
which
he
knew
nothing
had
often
transiently
arrested
him
before
,
but
it
came
upon
him
now
with
entire
novelty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
father
,
"
said
Tom
,
in
answer
to
the
gaze
.
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
trouble
your
mind
about
business
until
you
are
quite
well
;
everything
is
settled
about
that
for
the
present
,
 
about
the
mill
and
the
land
and
the
debts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
settled
,
then
?
"
said
his
father
,
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
take
on
too
much
bout
it
,
sir
,
"
said
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
You
'd
ha
'
paid
iverybody
<EOS>
if
you
could
,
 
that
's
what
I
said
to
Master
Tom
,
 
<EOS>
I
said
you
'd
ha
'
paid
iverybody
if
you
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Good
Luke
felt
,
after
the
manner
of
contented
hard
-
working
men
whose
lives
have
been
spent
in
servitude
,
that
sense
of
natural
fitness
in
rank
which
made
his
master
's
downfall
a
tragedy
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
urged
,
in
his
slow
way
,
to
say
something
that
would
express
his
share
in
the
family
sorrow
;
and
these
words
,
which
he
had
used
over
and
over
again
to
Tom
when
he
wanted
to
decline
the
full
payment
of
his
fifty
pounds
out
of
the
children
's
money
,
were
the
most
ready
to
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
They
were
just
the
words
to
lay
the
most
painful
hold
on
his
master
's
bewildered
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Paid
everybody
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
with
vehement
agitation
,
his
face
flushing
,
and
his
eye
lighting
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
 
what
 
have
they
made
me
a
_
bankrupt
?
<EOS>
_
"
  
"
Oh
,
father
,
dear
father
!
"
said
Maggie
,
who
thought
that
terrible
word
really
represented
the
fact
;
"
bear
it
well
,
because
we
love
you
;
your
children
will
always
love
you
.
<EOS>
Tom
will
pay
them
all
;
he
says
he
will
,
when
he
's
a
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
felt
her
father
beginning
to
tremble
;
his
voice
trembled
too
,
as
he
said
,
after
a
few
moments
:
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
my
little
wench
,
but
I
shall
never
live
twice
o'er
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
perhaps
you
will
live
to
see
me
pay
everybody
,
father
,
"
said
Tom
,
speaking
with
a
great
effort
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
my
lad
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
shaking
his
head
slowly
,
"
but
what
's
broke
can
never
be
whole
again
;
it
'
ud
be
your
doing
,
not
mine
.
"
<EOS>
Then
looking
up
at
him
,
"
You
're
only
sixteen
;
it
's
an
up
-
hill
fight
for
you
,
but
you
must
n't
throw
it
at
your
father
;
the
raskills
have
been
too
many
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
've
given
you
a
good
eddication
,
 
<EOS>
that
'll
start
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Something
in
his
throat
half
choked
the
last
words
;
the
flush
,
which
had
alarmed
his
children
because
it
had
so
often
preceded
a
recurrence
of
paralysis
,
had
subsided
,
and
his
face
looked
pale
and
tremulous
.
<EOS>
Tom
said
nothing
;
he
was
still
struggling
against
his
inclination
to
rush
away
.
<EOS>
His
father
remained
quiet
a
minute
or
two
,
but
his
mind
did
not
seem
to
be
wandering
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
they
sold
me
up
,
then
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
more
clamly
,
as
if
he
were
possessed
simply
by
the
desire
to
know
what
had
happened
.
  
<EOS>
"
Everything
is
sold
,
father
;
but
we
do
n't
know
all
about
the
mill
and
the
land
yet
,
"
said
Tom
,
anxious
to
ward
off
any
question
leading
to
the
fact
that
Wakem
was
the
purchaser
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
be
surprised
to
see
the
room
look
very
bare
downstairs
,
father
,
"
said
Maggie
;
"
<EOS>
but
there
's
your
chair
and
the
bureau
;
_
<EOS>
they
're
_
not
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
;
help
me
down
,
Luke
,
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
and
see
everything
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
leaning
on
his
stick
,
and
stretching
out
his
other
hand
toward
Luke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
sir
,
"
said
Luke
,
as
he
gave
his
arm
to
his
master
,
"
you
'll
make
up
your
mind
<EOS>
to't
a
bit
better
<EOS>
when
you
've
seen
iverything
;
you
'll
get
used
to't
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
my
mother
says
about
her
shortness
o
'
breath
,
 
<EOS>
she
says
she
's
made
friends
wi't
now
,
though
she
fought
again
'
it
sore
when
it
just
come
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
ran
on
before
to
see
that
all
was
right
in
the
dreary
parlor
,
where
the
fire
,
dulled
by
the
frosty
sunshine
,
seemed
part
of
the
general
shabbiness
.
<EOS>
She
turned
her
father
's
chair
,
and
pushed
aside
the
table
to
make
an
easy
way
for
him
,
and
then
stood
with
a
beating
heart
to
see
him
enter
and
look
round
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
Tom
advanced
before
him
,
carrying
the
leg
-
rest
,
and
stood
beside
Maggie
on
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
Of
those
two
young
hearts
Tom
's
suffered
the
most
unmixed
pain
,
for
Maggie
,
with
all
her
keen
susceptibility
,
yet
felt
as
if
the
sorrow
made
larger
room
for
her
love
to
flow
in
,
and
gave
breathing
-
space
to
her
passionate
nature
.
<EOS>
No
true
boy
feels
that
;
he
would
rather
go
and
slay
the
Nemean
lion
,
or
perform
any
round
of
heroic
labors
,
than
endure
perpetual
appeals
to
his
pity
,
for
evils
over
which
he
can
make
no
conquest
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
paused
just
inside
the
door
,
resting
on
Luke
,
and
looking
round
him
at
all
the
bare
places
,
which
for
him
were
filled
with
the
shadows
of
departed
objects
,
 
the
daily
companions
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
His
faculties
seemed
to
be
renewing
their
strength
from
getting
a
footing
on
this
demonstration
of
the
senses
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
slowly
,
moving
toward
his
chair
,
"
they
've
sold
me
up
 
<EOS>
they
've
sold
me
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
seating
himself
,
and
laying
down
his
stick
,
while
Luke
left
the
room
,
he
looked
round
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
've
left
the
big
Bible
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
got
everything
in
,
 
when
I
was
born
and
married
;
bring
it
me
,
Tom
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
quarto
Bible
was
laid
open
before
him
at
the
fly
-
leaf
,
and
while
he
was
reading
with
slowly
travelling
eyes
Mrs.
Tulliver
entered
the
room
,
but
stood
in
mute
surprise
to
find
her
husband
down
already
,
and
with
the
great
Bible
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
he
said
,
looking
at
a
spot
where
his
finger
rested
,
"
my
mother
was
Margaret
Beaton
;
she
died
when
she
was
forty
-
seven
,
 
hers
was
n't
a
long
-
lived
family
;
we
're
our
mother
's
children
,
Gritty
and
me
are
,
 
we
shall
go
to
our
last
bed
before
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
pausing
over
the
record
of
his
sister
's
birth
and
marriage
,
as
if
it
were
suggesting
new
thoughts
to
him
;
then
he
suddenly
looked
up
at
Tom
,
and
said
,
in
a
sharp
tone
of
alarm
:
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
n't
come
upo
'
Moss
for
the
money
as
I
lent
him
,
have
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
father
,
"
said
Tom
;
"
the
note
was
burnt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
turned
his
eyes
on
the
page
again
,
and
presently
said
:
  
"
Ah
 
Elizabeth
Dodson
 
<EOS>
it
's
eighteen
year
since
I
married
her
   
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
next
Ladyday
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
going
up
to
his
side
and
looking
at
the
page
.
  
<EOS>
Her
husband
fixed
his
eyes
earnestly
on
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Bessy
,
"
he
said
,
"
you
was
a
pretty
lass
then
,
 
everybody
said
so
,
 
and
I
used
to
think
you
kept
your
good
looks
rarely
.
<EOS>
But
you
're
sorely
aged
;
do
n't
you
bear
me
ill
-
will
 
I
meant
to
do
well
by
you
 
<EOS>
we
promised
one
another
for
better
or
for
worse
   
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
never
thought
it
'
ud
be
so
for
worse
as
this
,
"
said
poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
with
the
strange
,
scared
look
that
had
come
over
her
of
late
;
"
and
my
poor
father
gave
me
away
 
and
to
come
on
so
all
at
once
   
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
mother
!
"
said
Maggie
,
"
do
n't
talk
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
know
you
wo
n't
let
your
poor
mother
speak
 
<EOS>
that
's
been
the
way
all
my
life
 
<EOS>
your
father
never
minded
what
I
said
 
it
'
ud
have
been
o
'
no
use
for
me
to
beg
and
pray
 
<EOS>
and
it
'
ud
be
no
use
now
,
not
if
I
was
to
go
down
o
'
my
hands
and
knees
   
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
say
so
,
Bessy
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
whose
pride
,
in
these
first
moments
of
humiliation
,
was
in
abeyance
to
the
sense
of
some
justice
in
his
wife
's
reproach
.
<EOS>
"
It
there
's
anything
left
as
I
could
do
to
make
you
amends
,
I
would
n't
say
you
nay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
we
might
stay
here
and
get
a
living
,
and
I
might
keep
among
my
own
sisters
,
 
and
me
been
such
a
good
wife
to
you
,
and
never
crossed
you
from
week
's
end
to
week
's
end
 
<EOS>
and
they
all
say
<EOS>
so
 
they
say
it
'
ud
be
nothing
but
right
,
only
you
're
so
turned
against
Wakem
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
said
Tom
,
severely
,
"
this
is
not
the
time
to
talk
about
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
her
be
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
"
Say
what
you
mean
,
Bessy

"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
now
the
mill
and
the
land
's
all
Wakem
's
,
and
he
's
got
everything
in
his
hands
<EOS>
,
what
's
the
use
<EOS>
o
'
setting
your
face
against
him
,
when
he
says
you
may
stay
here
,
and
speaks
as
fair
as
can
be
,
and
says
you
may
manage
the
business
,
and
have
thirty
shillings
a
-
week
,
and
a
horse
to
ride
about
to
market
?
<EOS>
And
where
have
we
got
to
put
our
heads
?
<EOS>
We
must
go
into
one
o
'
the
cottages
in
the
village
,
 
and
me
and
my
children

Mr.

had
sunk
back
in
his
chair
trembling
.

"
You
may
do

he
said

in

voice
;

I

the
bringing

this

Say
no

no

I
've
had
enough
for

Give
me
a

us
bear
one
another
no

we

<EOS>
An
Item
Added
to
the
Family
Register
  
<EOS>
That
first
moment
of
renunciation
and
submission
was
followed
by
days
of
violent
struggle
in
the
miller
's
mind
,
as
the
gradual
access
of
bodily
strength
brought
with
it
increasing
ability
to
embrace
in
one
view
all
the
conflicting
conditions
under
which
he
found
himself
.
<EOS>
Feeble
limbs
easily
resign
themselves
to
be
tethered
,
and
when
we
are
subdued
by
sickness
it
seems
possible
to
us
to
fulfil
pledges
which
the
old
vigor
comes
back
and
breaks
.
<EOS>
There
were
times
when
poor
Tulliver
thought
the
fulfilment
of
his
promise
to
Bessy
was
something
quite
too
hard
for
human
nature
;
he
had
promised
her
without
knowing
what
she
was
going
to
say
,
 
she
might
as
well
have
asked
him
to
carry
a
ton
weight
on
his
back
.
<EOS>
But
again
,
there
were
many
feelings
arguing
on
her
side
,
besides
the
sense
that
life
had
been
made
hard
to
her
by
having
married
him
.
<EOS>
He
saw
a
possibility
,
by
much
pinching
,
of
saving
money
out
of
his
salary
toward
paying
a
second
dividend
to
his
creditors
,
and
it
would
not
be
easy
elsewhere
to
get
a
situation
such
as
he
could
fill
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
led
an
easy
life
,
ordering
much
and
working
little
,
and
had
no
aptitude
for
any
new
business
.
<EOS>
He
must
perhaps
take
to
day
-
labor
,
and
his
wife
must
have
help
from
her
sisters
,
 
a
prospect
doubly
bitter
to
him
,
now
they
had
let
all
Bessy
's
precious
things
be
sold
,
probably
because
they
liked
to
set
her
against
him
,
by
making
her
feel
that
he
had
brought
her
to
that
pass
.
<EOS>
He
listened
to
their
admonitory
talk
,
when
they
came
to
urge
on
him
what
he
was
bound
to
do
for
poor
Bessy
's
sake
,
with
averted
eyes
,
that
every
now
and
then
flashed
on
them
furtively
when
their
backs
were
turned
.
<EOS>
Nothing
but
the
dread
of
needing
their
help
could
have
made
it
an
easier
alternative
to
take
their
advice
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
strongest
influence
of
all
was
the
love
of
the
old
premises
where
he
had
run
about
when
he
was
a
boy
,
just
as
Tom
had
done
after
him
.
<EOS>
The
Tullivers
had
lived
on
this
spot
for
generations
,
and
he
had
sat
listening
on
a
low
stool
on
winter
evenings
while
his
father
talked
of
the
old
half
-
timbered
mill
that
had
been
there
before
the
last
great
floods
which
damaged
it
so
that
his
grandfather
pulled
it
down
and
built
the
new
one
.
<EOS>
It
was
when
he
got
able
to
walk
about
and
look
at
all
the
old
objects
that
he
felt
the
strain
of
his
clinging
affection
for
the
old
home
as
part
of
his
life
,
part
of
himself
.
<EOS>
He
could
n't
bear
to
think
of
himself
living
on
any
other
spot
than
this
,
where
he
knew
the
sound
of
every
gate
door
,
and
felt
that
the
shape
and
color
of
every
roof
and
weather
-
stain
and
broken
hillock
was
good
,
because
his
growing
senses
had
been
fed
on
them
.
<EOS>
Our
instructed
vagrancy
,
which
was
hardly
time
to
linger
by
the
hedgerows
,
but
runs
away
early
to
the
tropics
,
and
is
at
home
with
palms
and
banyans
,
 
which
is
nourished
on
books
of
travel
and
stretches
the
theatre
of
its
imagination
to
the
Zambesi
,
 
can
hardly
get
a
dim
notion
of
what
an
old
-
fashioned
man
like
Tulliver
felt
for
this
spot
,
where
all
his
memories
centred
,
and
where
life
seemed
like
a
familiar
smooth
-
handled
tool
that
the
fingers
clutch
with
loving
ease
.
<EOS>
And
just
now
he
was
living
in
that
freshened
memory
of
the
far
-
off
time
which
comes
to
us
in
the
passive
hours
of
recovery
from
sickness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
Luke
,
"
he
said
one
afternoon
,
as
he
stood
looking
over
the
orchard
gate
,
"
I
remember
the
day
they
planted
those
apple
-
trees
.
<EOS>
My
father
was
a
huge
man
for
planting
,
 
<EOS>
it
was
like
a
merry
-
making
to
him
to
get
a
cart
full
o
'
young
trees
;
and
I
used
to
stand
i
'
the
cold
with
him
,
and
follow
him
about
like
a
dog
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
he
turned
round
,
and
leaning
against
the
gate
-
post
,
looked
at
the
opposite
buildings
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
old
mill
'
ud
miss
me
,
I
think
,
Luke
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
story
as
when
the
mill
changes
hands
,
the
river
's
angry
;
I
've
heard
my
father
say
it
many
a
time
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
telling
whether
there
may
n't
be
summat
_
in
_
<EOS>
the
story
,
for
this
is
a
puzzling
world
,
and
Old
Harry
's
got
a
finger
in
it
 
<EOS>
it
's
been
too
many
for
me
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay

"
said
Luke
,
with
soothing
sympathy
,
"
<EOS>
what
wi
'
the
rust

'

I

often

there
's
the
bacon

wi
'

run
away
like
butter
,
 
it
leaves
nought
but

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
just
as
if
it
was
yesterday
,
now
<EOS>
,
"
Mr.
Tulliver
went
on
,
"
when
my
father
began
the
malting
.
<EOS>
I
remember
,
the
day
they
finished
the
malt
-
house
,
I
thought
summat
great
was
to
come
of
it
;
for
we
'd
a
plum
-
pudding
that
day
and
a
bit
of
a
feast
,
and
<EOS>
I
said
to
my
mother
,
 
she
was
a
fine
dark
-
eyed
woman
<EOS>
,
my
mother
was
,
 
the
little
wench
"
ull
be
as
like
her
as
two
peas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
Mr.
Tulliver
put
his
stick
between
his
legs
,
and
took
out
his
snuff
-
box
,
for
the
greater
enjoyment
of
this
anecdote
,
which
dropped
from
him
in
fragments
,
as
if
he
every
other
moment
lost
narration
in
vision
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
a
little
chap
no
higher
much
than
my
mother
's
knee
,
 
she
was
sore
fond
of
us
children
,
Gritty
and
me
,
 
and
so
I
said
to
her
,
"
<EOS>
Mother
,
"
I
said
,
"
shall
we
have
plum
-
pudding
_
every
_
day
because
o
'
the
malt
-
house
?
<EOS>
She
used
to
tell
me
o
'
that
till
her
dying
day
.
<EOS>
She
was
but
a
young
woman
when
she
died
,
my
mother
was
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
forty
good
year
since
they
finished
the
malt
-
house
,
and
it
is
n't
many
days
out
of
'em
all
as
I
have
n't
looked
out
into
the
yard
there
,
the
first
thing
in

all
weathers
,
from
year

end

year

<EOS>
I
should
go
off
my
head
in
a
new
place
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
like
as
if
I
'd
lost
my
way

<EOS>
It
's
all
hard
,
<EOS>
whichever
way
I
look
at
it
,
 
the
harness
"
ull

but
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay

said
Luke
,
"
you

But
I

Luke
,
they
'll
be
for
getting
rid

Ben

and
making

"
  
<EOS>
The
walk
was
finished
in
silence
after
this
,
for
Luke
had
disburthened
himself
of
thoughts
to
an
extent
that
left
his
conversational
resources
quite
barren
,
and
Mr.
Tulliver
had
relapsed
from
his
recollections
into
a
painful
meditation
on
the
choice
of
hardships
before
him
.
<EOS>
Maggie
noticed
that
he
was
unusually
absent
that
evening
at
tea
;
and
afterward
he
sat
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
,
looking
at
the
ground
,
moving
his
lips
,
and
shaking
his
head
from
time
to
time
.
<EOS>
Then
he
looked
hard
at
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
who
was
knitting
opposite
him
,
then
at
Maggie
,
who
,
as
she
bent
over
her
sewing
,
was
intensely
conscious
of
some
drama
going
forward
in
her
father
's
mind
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
took
up
the
poker
and
broke
the
large
coal
fiercely
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
heart
,
Mr.
Tulliver
,
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
?
"
said
his
wife
,
looking
up
in
alarm
;
"
it
's
very
wasteful
,
breaking
the
coal
,
and
we
've
got
hardly
any
large
coal
left
,
and
I
do
n't
know
where
the
rest
is
to
come
from
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
you
're
quite
so
well
to
-
night
,
are
you
,
father
?
"
<EOS>
said
Maggie
;
<EOS>
"
you
seem
uneasy
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
is
it
Tom
does
n't
come
?
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
heart
,
is
it
time
?
<EOS>
I
must
go
and
get
his
supper
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
laying
down
her
knitting
,
and
leaving
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
nigh
upon
half
-
past
eight
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
"
He
'll
be
here
soon
.
<EOS>
Go
,
go
and
get
the
big
Bible
,
and
open
it
at
the
beginning
,
where
everything
's
set
down
.
<EOS>
And
get
the
pen
and
ink
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
obeyed
,
wondering
;
but
her
father
gave
no
further
orders
,
and
only
sat
listening
for
Tom
's
footfall
on
the
gravel
,
apparently
irritated
by
the
wind
,
which
had
risen
,
and
was
roaring
so
as
to
drown
all
other
sounds
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
strange
light
in
his
eyes
<EOS>
that
rather
frightened
Maggie
;
_
<EOS>
she
_
began
to
wish
that
Tom
would
come
,
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
he
is
,
then
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
in
an
excited
way
,
when
the
knock
came
at
last
.
<EOS>
Maggie
went
to
open
the
door
,
but
her
mother
came
out
of
the
kitchen
hurriedly
,
saying
,
"
Stop
a
bit
,
Maggie
;
I
'll
open
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
begun
to
be
a
little
frightened
at
her
boy
,
but
she
was
jealous
of
every
office
others
did
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
supper
's
ready
by
the
kitchen
-
fire
,
my
boy
,
"
she
said
,
as
he
took
off
his
hat
and
coat
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
it
by
yourself
,
just
as
you
like
,
and
I
wo
n't
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
my
father
wants
Tom
,
mother
,
"
said
Maggie
;
"
he
must
come
into
the
parlor
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
entered
with
his
usual
saddened
evening
face
,
but
his
eyes
fell
immediately
on
the
open
Bible
and
the
inkstand
,
and
he
glanced
with
a
look
of
anxious
surprise
at
his
father
,
who
was
saying
,
    
"
Come
,
come
,
you
're
late
;
I
want
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anything
the
matter
,
father
?
"
said
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
sit
down
,
all
of
you
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
peremptorily
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
,
Tom
,
sit
down
here
;
I
've
got
something
for
you
to
write
i
'
the
Bible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
all
three
sat
down
,
looking
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
speak
slowly
,
looking
first
at
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
made
up
my
mind
,
Bessy
,
and
I
'll
be
as
good
as
my
word
to
you
.
<EOS>
There
'll
be
the
same
grave
made
for
us
to
lie
down
in
,
and
we
must
n't
be
bearing
one
another
ill
-
will
.
<EOS>
I
'll
stop
in
the
old
place
,
and
I
'll
serve
under

I
'll
serve
him
like
an
honest
man

there
's
no
Tulliver
<EOS>
but
what
's
honest
,
mind
that
,
Tom
,
"
 
here
his
voice
rose
,
 
"
they
'll
have
it
to
throw
up
against
me
as
I
paid
a
dividend
,
but
it
was
n't
my
fault
;
it
was
because
there
's
raskills
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
They
've
been
too
many
for
me
,
and
I
must
give
in
.
<EOS>
I
'll
put
my
neck
in
harness
,
 
for
you
've
a
right
to
say
as
I
've
brought
you
into
trouble
,
Bessy
,
 
and
I
'll
serve
him
as
honest
as
if
he
was
no
raskill
;
I
'm
an
honest
man
,
though
I
shall
never
hold
my
head
up
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
'm
a
tree
as
is
broke
 
a
tree
as
is
broke

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
and
looked
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Then
suddenly
raising
his
head
,
he
said
,
in
a
louder
yet
deeper
tone
:
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
wo
n't
forgive
him
!
<EOS>
I
know
what
they
say
,
he
never
meant
me
any
harm
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
way
Old
Harry
props
up
the
rascals
.
<EOS>
He
's
been
at
the
bottom
of
everything
;
but
he
's
a
fine
gentleman
,
 
I
know
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
I
should
n't
ha
'
gone
to
law
,
they
say
.
<EOS>
But
who
made
it
so
as
there
was
no
arbitratin
'
,
and
no
justice
to
be
got
?
<EOS>
It
signifies
nothing
to
him
,
I
know
that
;
he
's
<EOS>
one
o
'
them
fine
gentlemen
as
get
money
by
doing
business
for
poorer
folks
,
and
when
he
's
made
beggars
of
'em
he
'll
give
'em
charity
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
forgive
him
!
<EOS>
I
wish
he
might
be
punished
with
shame
till
his
own
son
'
ud
like
to
forget
him
.
<EOS>
I
wish
he
may
do
summat
as
they
'd
make
him
work
at
the
treadmill
!
<EOS>
But
he
wo
n't
,
 
<EOS>
he
's
too
big
a
raskill
to
let
the
law
lay
hold
on
him
.
<EOS>
And
you
mind
this
<EOS>
,
Tom
,
 
you
never
forgive
him
neither
,
if
you
mean
to
be
my
son

<EOS>
There
'll
maybe
come
a
time
when
you
may
make
him
feel
;
it
'll
never
come
to
me

I'n
got
my

Now

Oh

said
Maggie
,
sinking
down
by
his

pale
and
trembling

fiercely

<EOS>

said
Tom
,
with
gloomy
submission

<EOS>
"
Write
as

Edward

took
service
under
John
Wakem

the
man
as
had
helped
to
ruin

because
I
'd
promised
my

to
make
her
<EOS>
what
amends

I
could

and
because
I
wanted
to

th

old

<EOS>
There
was
a
dead
silence
as
Tom
's
pen
moved
along
the
paper
;
Mrs.
Tulliver
looked
scared

and
Maggie
trembled
like
a

"

almost

A
Variation

Unknown

Bossuet
  
<EOS>
Journeying
down
the
Rhone
on
a
summer
's
day
,
you
have
perhaps
felt
the
sunshine
made
dreary
by
those
ruined
villages
which
stud
the
banks
in
certain
parts
of
its
course
,
telling
how
the
swift
river
once
rose
,
like
an
angry
,
destroying
god
,
sweeping
down
the
feeble
generations
whose
breath
is
in
their
nostrils
,
and
making
their
dwellings
a
desolation
.
<EOS>
Strange
contrast
,
you
may
have
thought
,
between
the
effect
produced
on
us
by
these
dismal
remnants
of
commonplace
houses
,
which
in
their
best
days
were
but
the
sign
of
a
sordid
life
,
belonging
in
all
its
details
to
our
own
vulgar
era
,
and
the
effect
produced
by
those
ruins
on
the
castled
Rhine
,
which
have
crumbled
and
mellowed
into
such
harmony
with
the
green
and
rocky
steeps
that
they
seem
to
have
a
natural
fitness
,
like
the
mountain
-
pine
;
nay
,
even
in
the
day
when
they
were
built
they
must
have
had
this
fitness
,
as
if
they
had
been
raised
by
an
earth
-
born
race
,
who
had
inherited
from
their
mighty
parent
a
sublime
instinct
of
form
.
<EOS>
And
that
was
a
day
of
romance
;
If
those
robber
-
barons
were
somewhat
grim
and
drunken
ogres
,
they
had
a
certain
grandeur
of
the
wild
beast
in
them
,
 
they
were
forest
boars
with
tusks
,
tearing
and
rending
,
not
the
ordinary
domestic
grunter
;
they
represented
the
demon
forces
forever
in
collision
with
beauty
,
virtue
,
and
the
gentle
uses
of
life
;
they
made
a
fine
contrast
in
the
picture
with
the
wandering
minstrel
,
the
soft
-
lipped
princess
,
the
pious
recluse
,
and
the
timid
Israelite
.
<EOS>
That
was
a
time
of
color
,
when
the
sunlight
fell
on
glancing
steel
and
floating
banners
;
a
time
of
adventure
and
fierce
struggle
,
 
nay
,
of
living
,
religious
art
and
religious
enthusiasm
;
for
were
not
cathedrals
built
in
those
days
,
and
did
not
great
emperors
leave
their
Western
palaces
to
die
before
the
infidel
strongholds
in
the
sacred
East
?
<EOS>
Therefore
it
is
that
these
Rhine
castles
thrill
me
with
a
sense
of
poetry
;
they
belong
to
the
grand
historic
life
of
humanity
,
and
raise
up
for
me
the
vision
of
an
echo
.
<EOS>
But
these
dead
-
tinted
,
hollow
-
eyed
,
angular
skeletons
of
villages
on
the
Rhone
oppress
me
with
the
feeling
that
human
life
 
very
much
of
it
 
is
a
narrow
,
ugly
,
grovelling
existence
,
which
even
calamity
does
not
elevate
,
but
rather
tends
to
exhibit
in
all
its
bare
vulgarity
of
conception
;
and
I
have
a
cruel
conviction
that
the
lives
these
ruins
are
the
traces
of
<EOS>
were
part
of
a
gross
sum
of
obscure
vitality
,
that
will
be
swept
into
the
same
oblivion
with
the
generations
of
ants
and
beavers
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
something
akin
to
this
oppressive
feeling
may
have
weighed
upon
you
in
watching
this
old
-
fashioned
family
life
on
the
banks
of
the
Floss
,
which
even
sorrow
hardly
suffices
to
lift
above
the
level
of
the
tragi
-
comic
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
sordid
life
,
you
say
,
this
of
the
Tullivers
and
Dodsons
,
irradiated
by
no
sublime
principles
,
no
romantic
visions
,
no
active
,
self
-
renouncing
faith
;
moved
by
none
of
those
wild
,
uncontrollable
passions
which
create
the
dark
shadows
of
misery
and
crime
;
without
that
primitive
,
rough
simplicity
of
wants
,
that
hard
,
submissive
,
ill
-
paid
toil
,
<EOS>
that
childlike
spelling
-
out
of
what
nature
has
written
,
which
gives
its
poetry
to
peasant
life
.
<EOS>
Here
one
has
conventional
worldly
notions
and
habits
without
instruction
and
without
polish
,
surely
the
most
prosaic
form
of
human
life
;
proud
respectability
in
a
gig
of
unfashionable
build
;
worldliness
without
side
-
dishes
.
<EOS>
Observing
these
people
narrowly
,
even
when
the
iron
hand
of
misfortune
has
shaken
them
from
their
unquestioning
hold
on
the
world
,
one
sees
little
trace
of
religion
,
still
less
of
a
distinctively
Christian
creed
.
<EOS>
Their
belief
in
the
Unseen
,
so
far
as
it
manifests
itself
at
all
,
seems
to
be
rather
a
pagan
kind
;
their
moral
notions
,
though
held
with
strong
tenacity
,
seem
to
have
no
standard
beyond
hereditary
custom
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
live
among
such
people
;
you
are
stifled
for
want
of
an
outlet
toward
something
beautiful
,
great
,
or
noble
;
you
are
irritated
with
these
dull
men
and
women
,
as
a
kind
of
population
out
of
keeping
with
the
earth
on
which
they
live
,
 
with
this
rich
plain
where
the
great
river
flows
forever
onward
,
and
links
the
small
pulse
of
the
old
English
town
with
the
beatings
of
the
world
's
mighty
heart
.
<EOS>
A
vigorous
superstition
,
that
lashes
its
gods
or
lashes
its
own
back
,
seems
to
be
more
congruous
with
the
mystery
of
the
human
lot
,
than
the
mental
condition
of
these
emmet
-
like
Dodsons
and
Tullivers
.
  
<EOS>
I
share
with
you
this
sense
of
oppressive
narrowness
;
but
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
feel
it
,
if
we
care
to
understand
how
it
acted
on
the
lives
of
Tom
and
Maggie
,
 
how
it
has
acted
on
young
natures
in
many
generations
,
that
in
the
onward
tendency
of
human
things
have
risen
above
the
mental
level
of
the
generation
before
them
,
to
which
they
have
been
nevertheless
tied
by
the
strongest
fibres
of
their
hearts
.
<EOS>
The
suffering
,
whether
of
martyr
or
victim
,
which
belongs
to
every
historical
advance
of
mankind
,
is
represented
in
this
way
in
every
town
,
and
by
hundreds
of
obscure
hearths
;
and
we
need
not
shrink
from
this
comparison
of
small
things
with
great
;
for
does
not
science
tell
us
that
its
highest
striving
is
after
the
ascertainment
of
a
unity
which
shall
bind
the
smallest
things
with
the
greatest
?
<EOS>
In
natural
science
,
I
have
understood
,
there
is
nothing
petty
to
the
mind
that
has
a
large
vision
of
relations
,
and
to
which
every
single
object
suggests
a
vast
sum
of
conditions
.
<EOS>
It
is
surely
the
same
with
the
observation
of
human
life
.
  
<EOS>
Certainly
the
religious
and
moral
ideas
of
the
Dodsons
and
Tullivers
were
of
too
specific
a
kind
to
be
arrived
at
deductively
,
from
the
statement
that
they
were
part
of
the
Protestant
population
of
Great
Britain
.
<EOS>
Their
theory
of
life
had
its
core
of
soundness
,
as
all
theories
must
have
on
which
decent
and
prosperous
families
have
been
reared
and
have
flourished
;
but
it
had
the
very
slightest
tincture
of
theology
.
<EOS>
If
,
in
the
maiden
days
of
the
Dodson
sisters
,
their
Bibles
opened
more
easily
at
some
parts
than
others
,
it
was
because
of
dried
tulip
-
petals
,
which
had
been
distributed
quite
impartially
,
without
preference
for
the
historical
,
devotional
,
or
doctrinal
.
<EOS>
Their
religion
was
of
a
simple
,
semi
-
pagan
kind
,
but
there
was
no
heresy
in
it
,
 
if
heresy
properly
means
choice
,
 
for
they
did
n't
know
there
was
any
other
religion
,
except
that
of
chapel
-
goers
,
which
appeared
to
run
in
families
,
like
asthma
.
<EOS>
How
_
should
_
they
know
?
<EOS>
The
vicar
of
their
pleasant
rural
parish
was
not
a
controversialist
,
but
a
good
hand
at
whist
,
and
one
who
had
a
joke
always
ready
for
a
blooming
female
parishioner
.
<EOS>
The
religion
of
the
Dodsons
consisted
in
revering
whatever
was
customary
and
respectable
;
it
was
necessary
to
be
baptized
,
else
one
could
not
be
buried
in
the
church
-
yard
,
and
to
take
the
sacrament
before
death
,
as
a
security
against
more
dimly
understood
perils
;
but
it
was
of
equal
necessity
to
have
the
proper
pall
-
bearers
and
well
-
cured
hams
at
one
's
funeral
,
and
to
leave
an
unimpeachable
will
.
<EOS>
A
Dodson
would
not
be
taxed
with
the
omission
of
anything
that
was
becoming
,
or
that
belonged
to
that
eternal
fitness
of
things
which
was
plainly
indicated
in
the
practice
of
the
most
substantial
parishioners
,
and
in
the
family
traditions
,
 
such
as
obedience
to
parents
,
faithfulness
to
kindred
,
industry
,
rigid
honesty
,
thrift
,
the
thorough
scouring
of
wooden
and
copper
utensils
,
the
hoarding
of
coins
likely
to
disappear
from
the
currency
,
the
production
of
first
-
rate
commodities
for
the
market
,
and
the
general
preference
of
whatever
was
home
-
made
.
<EOS>
The
Dodsons
were
a
very
proud
race
,
and
their
pride
lay
in
the
utter
frustration
of
all
desire
to
tax
them
with
a
breach
of
traditional
duty
or
propriety
.
<EOS>
A
wholesome
pride
in
many
respects
,
since
it
identified
honor
with
perfect
integrity
,
thoroughness
of
work
,
and
faithfulness
to
admitted
rules
;
and
society
owes
some
worthy
qualities
in
many
of
her
members
to
mothers
of
the
Dodson
class
,
who
made
their
butter
and
their
fromenty
well
,
and
would
have
felt
disgraced
to
make
it
otherwise
.
<EOS>
To
be
honest
and
poor
was
never
a
Dodson
motto
,
still
less
to
seem
rich
though
being
poor
;
rather
,
the
family
badge
was
to
be
honest
and
rich
,
and
not
only
rich
,
but
richer
than
was
supposed
.
<EOS>
To
live
respected
,
and
have
the
proper
bearers
at
your
funeral
,
was
an
achievement
of
the
ends
of
existence
that
would
be
entirely
nullified
if
,
on
the
reading
of
your
will
,
you
sank
in
the
opinion
of
your
fellow
-
men
,
either
by
turning
out
to
be
poorer
than
they
expected
,
or
by
leaving
your
money
in
a
capricious
manner
,
without
strict
regard
to
degrees
of
kin
.
<EOS>
The
right
thing
must
always
be
done
toward
kindred
.
<EOS>
The
right
thing
was
to
correct
them
severely
,
if
they
were
other
than
a
credit
to
the
family
,
but
still
not
to
alienate
from
them
the
smallest
rightful
share
in
the
family
shoebuckles
and

A
conspicuous
quality
in
the
Dodson
character
was
its
genuineness
;
its
vices
and
virtues
alike
were
phases
of
a
proud
honest
egoism
,
which
had
a
hearty
dislike
to
whatever
made
against
its
own
credit
and
interest
,
and
would
be
frankly
hard
of
speech
to
inconvenient
"
kin
,
"
but
would
never
forsake
or
ignore
them
,
 
would
not
let
them
want
bread
,
but
only
require
them
to
eat
it
with
bitter
herbs
.
  
<EOS>
The
same
sort
of
traditional
belief
ran
in
the
Tulliver
veins
,
but
it
was
carried
in
richer
blood
,
having
elements
of
generous
imprudence
,
warm
affection
,
and
hot
-
tempered
rashness
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
's
grandfather
had
been
heard
to
say
that
he
was
descended
from
one
Ralph
Tulliver
,
a
wonderfully
clever
fellow
,
who
had
ruined
himself
.
<EOS>
It
is
likely
enough
that
the
clever
Ralph
was
a
high
liver
,
rode
spirited
horses
,
and
was
very
decidedly
of
his
own
opinion
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
nobody
had
ever
heard
of
a
Dodson
who
had
ruined
himself
;
it
was
not
the
way
of
that
family
.
  
<EOS>
If
such
were
the
views
of
life
on
which
the
Dodsons
and
Tullivers
had
been
reared
in
the
praiseworthy
past
of
Pitt
and
high
prices
,
you
will
infer
from
what
you
already
know
concerning
the
state
of
society
in
St.
Ogg
's
,
that
there
had
been
no
highly
modifying
influence
to
act
on
them
in
their
maturer
life
.
<EOS>
It
was
still
possible
,
even
in
that
later
time
of
anti
-
Catholic
preaching
,
for
people
to
hold
many
pagan
ideas
,
and
believe
themselves
good
church
-
people
,
notwithstanding
;
so
we
need
hardly
feel
any
surprise
at
the
fact
that
Mr.
Tulliver
,
though
a
regular
church
-
goer
,
recorded
his
vindictiveness
on
the
fly
-
leaf
of
his
Bible
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
any
harm
could
be
said
concerning
the
vicar
of
that
charming
rural
parish
to
which
Dorlcote
Mill
belonged
;
he
was
a
man
of
excellent
family
,
an
irreproachable
bachelor
,
of
elegant
pursuits
,
 
had
taken
honors
,
and
held
a
fellowship
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
regarded
him
with
dutiful
respect
,
as
he
did
everything
else
belonging
to
the
church
-
service
;
but
he
considered
that
church
was
one
thing
and
common
-
sense
another
,
and
he
wanted
nobody
to
tell
_
him
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
what
commonsense
was
.
<EOS>
Certain
seeds
which
are
required
to
find
a
nidus
for
themselves
under
unfavorable
circumstances
have
been
supplied
by
nature
with
an
apparatus
of
hooks
,
so
that
they
will
get
a
hold
on
very
unreceptive
surfaces
.
<EOS>
The
spiritual
seed
which
had
been
scattered
over
Mr.
Tulliver
had
apparently
been
destitute
of
any
corresponding
provision
,
and
had
slipped
off
to
the
winds
again
,
from
a
total
absence
of
hooks
.

The

<EOS>
There
is
something
sustaining
in
the
very
agitation
that
accompanies
the
first
shocks
of
trouble
,
just
as
an
acute
pain
is
often
a
stimulus
,
and
produces
an
excitement
which
is
transient
strength
.
<EOS>
It
is
in
the
slow
,
changed
life
that
follows
;
in
the
time
when
sorrow
has
become
stale
,
and
has
no
longer
an
emotive
intensity
that
counteracts
its
pain
;
in
the
time
when
day
follows
day
in
dull
,
unexpectant
sameness
,
and
trial
is
a
dreary
routine
,
 
<EOS>
it
is
then
that
despair
threatens
;
it
is
then
that
the
peremptory
hunger
of
the
soul
is
felt
,
and
eye
and
ear
are
strained
after
some
unlearned
secret
of
our
existence
,
which
shall
give
to
endurance
the
nature
of
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
This
time
of
utmost
need
was
come
to
Maggie
,
with
her
short
span
of
thirteen
years
.
<EOS>
To
the
usual
precocity
of
the
girl
,
she
added
that
early
experience
of
struggle
,
of
conflict
between
the
inward
impulse
and
outward
fact
,
which
is
the
lot
of
every
imaginative
and
passionate
nature
;
and
the
years
since
she
hammered
the
nails
into
her
wooden
Fetish
among
the
worm
-
eaten
shelves
of
the
attic
had
been
filled
with
so
eager
a
life
in
the
triple
world
of
Reality
,
Books
,
and
Waking
Dreams
,
that
Maggie
was
strangely
old
for
her
years
in
everything
except
in
her
entire
want
of
that
prudence
and
self
-
command
which
were
the
qualities
that
made
Tom
manly
in
the
midst
of
his
intellectual
boyishness
.
<EOS>
And
now
her
lot
was
beginning
to
have
a
still
,
sad
monotony
,
which
threw
her
more
than
ever
on
her
inward
self
.
<EOS>
Her
father
was
able
to
attend
to
business
again
,
his
affairs
were
settled
,
and
he
was
acting
as
Wakem
's
manager
on
the
old
spot
.
<EOS>
Tom
went
to
and
fro
every
morning
and
evening
,
and
became
more
and
more
silent
in
the
short
intervals
at
home
;
what
was
there
to
say
?
<EOS>
One
day
was
like
another
;
and
Tom
's
interest
in
life
,
driven
back
and
crushed
on
every
other
side
,
was
concentrating
itself
into
the
one
channel
of
ambitious
resistance
to
misfortune
.
<EOS>
The
peculiarities
of
his
father
and
mother
were
very
irksome
to
him
,
now
they
were
laid
bare
of
all
the
softening
accompaniments
of
an
easy
,
prosperous
home
;
for
Tom
had
very
clear
,
prosaic
eyes
,
not
apt
to
be
dimmed
by
mists
of
feeling
or
imagination
.
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
it
seemed
,
would
never
recover
her
old
self
,
her
placid
household
activity
;
how
could
she
?
<EOS>
The
objects
among
which
her
mind
had
moved
complacently
were
all
gone
,
 
all
the
little
hopes
and
schemes
and
speculations
,
all
the
pleasant
little
cares
about
her
treasures
which
had
made
the
world
quite
comprehensible
to
her
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
,
since
she
had
made
her
first
purchase
of
the
sugar
-
tongs
,
had
been
suddenly
snatched
away
from
her
,
and
she
remained
bewildered
in
this
empty
life
.
<EOS>
Why
that
should
have
happened
to
her
which
had
not
happened
to
other
women
remained
an
insoluble
question
by
which
she
expressed
her
perpetual
ruminating
comparison
of
the
past
with
the
present
.
<EOS>
It
was
piteous
to
see
the
comely
woman
getting
thinner
and
more
worn
under
a
bodily
as
well
as
mental
restlessness
,
which
made
her
often
wander
about
the
empty
house
after
her
work
was
done
,
until
Maggie
,
becoming
alarmed
about
her
,
would
seek
her
,
and
bring
her
down
by
telling
her
how
it
vexed
Tom
that
she
was
injuring
her
health
by
never
sitting
down
and
resting
herself
.
<EOS>
Yet
amidst
this
helpless
imbecility
there
was
a
touching
trait
of
humble
,
self
-
devoting
maternity
,
which
made
Maggie
feel
tenderly
toward
her
poor
mother
amidst
all
the
little
wearing
griefs
caused
by
her
mental
feebleness
.
<EOS>
She
would
let
Maggie
do
none
of
the
work
that
was
heaviest
and
most
soiling
to
the
hands
,
and
was
quite
peevish
when
Maggie
attempted
to
relieve
her
from
her
grate
-
brushing
and
scouring
:
"
<EOS>
Let
it
alone
,
my
dear
;
your
hands
"
ull
get
as
hard
as
hard
<EOS>
,
"
she
would
say
;
"
it
's
your
mother
's
place
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
do
the
sewing
 
<EOS>
my
eyes
fail
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
would
still
brush
and
carefully
tend
Maggie
's
hair
,
which
she
had
become
reconciled
to
,
in
spite
of
its
refusal
to
curl
<EOS>
,
now
it
was
so
long
and
massy
.
<EOS>
Maggie
was
not
her
pet
child
,
and
,
in
general
,
would
have
been
much
better
if
she
had
been
quite
different
;
yet
the
womanly
heart
,
so
bruised
in
its
small
personal
desires
,
found
a
future
to
rest
on
in
the
life
of
this
young
thing
,
and
the
mother
pleased
herself
with
wearing
out
her
own
hands
to
save
the
hands
that
had
so
much
more
life
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
constant
presence
of
her
mother
's
regretful
bewilderment
was
less
painful
to
Maggie
than
that
of
her
father
's
sullen
,
incommunicative
depression
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
the
paralysis
was
upon
him
,
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
might
always
be
in
a
childlike
condition
of
dependence
,
 
as
long
as
he
was
still
only
half
awakened
to
his
trouble
,
 
Maggie
had
felt
the
strong
tide
of
pitying
love
almost
as
an
inspiration
,
a
new
power
,
that
would
make
the
most
difficult
life
easy
for
his
sake
;
but
now
,
instead
of
childlike
dependence
,
there
had
come
a
taciturn
,
hard
concentration
of
purpose
,
in
strange
contrast
with
his
old
vehement
communicativeness
and
high
spirit
;
and
this
lasted
from
day
to
day
,
and
from
week
to
week
,
the
dull
eye
never
brightening
with
any
eagerness
or
any
joy
.
<EOS>
It
is
something
cruelly
incomprehensible
to
youthful
natures
,
this
sombre
sameness
in
middle
-
aged
and
elderly
people
,
whose
life
has
resulted
in
disappointment
and
discontent
,
to
whose
faces
a
smile
becomes
so
strange
that
the
sad
lines
all
about
the
lips
and
brow
seem
to
take
no
notice
of
it
,
and
it
hurries
away
again
for
want
of
a
welcome
.
<EOS>
"
Why
will
they
not
kindle
up
and
be
glad
sometimes
?
"
thinks
young
elasticity
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
so
easy
if
they
only
liked
to
do
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
these
leaden
clouds
that
never
part
are
apt
to
create
impatience
even
in
the
filial
affection
that
streams
forth
in
nothing
but
tenderness
and
pity
in
the
time
of
more
obvious
affliction
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
lingered
nowhere
away
from
home
;
he
hurried
away
from
market
,
he
refused
all
invitations
to
stay
and
chat
,
as
in
old
times
,
in
the
houses
where
he
called
on
business
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
reconciled
with
his
lot
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
attitude
in
which
his
pride
did
not
feel
its
bruises
;
and
in
all
behavior
toward
him
,
whether
kind
or
cold
,
he
detected
an
allusion
to
the
change
in
his
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Even
the
days
on
which
Wakem
came
to
ride
round
the
land
and
inquire
into
the
business
were
not
so
black
to
him
as
those
market
-
days
on
which
he
had
met
several
creditors
who
had
accepted
a
composition
from
him
.
<EOS>
To
save
something
toward
the
repayment
of
those
creditors
was
the
object
toward
which
he
was
now
bending
all
his
thoughts
and
efforts
;
and
under
the
influence
of
this
all
-
compelling
demand
of
his
nature
,
the
somewhat
profuse
man
,
who
hated
to
be
stinted
or
to
stint
any
one
else
in
his
own
house
,
was
gradually
metamorphosed
into
the
keen
-
eyed
grudger
of
morsels
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
could
not
economize
enough
to
satisfy
him
,
in
their
food
and
firing
;
and
he
would
eat
nothing
himself
but
what
was
of
the
coarsest
quality
.
<EOS>
Tom
,
though
depressed
and
strongly
repelled
by
his
father
's
sullenness
,
and
the
dreariness
of
home
,
entered
thoroughly
into
his
father
's
feelings
about
paying
the
creditors
;
and
the
poor
lad
brought
his
first
quarter
's
money
,
with
a
delicious
sense
of
achievement
,
and
gave
it
to
his
father
to
put
into
the
tin
box
which
held
the
savings
.
<EOS>
The
little
store
of
sovereigns
in
the
tin
box
seemed
to
be
the
only
sight
that
brought
a
faint
beam
of
pleasure
into
the
miller
's
eyes
,
 
faint
and
transient
,
for
it
was
soon
dispelled
by
the
thought
that
the
time
would
be
long
 
perhaps
longer
than
his
life
,
 
before
the
narrow
savings
could
remove
the
hateful
incubus
of
debt
.
<EOS>
A
deficit
of
more
than
five
hundred
pounds
,
with
the
accumulating
interest
,
seemed
a
deep
pit
to
fill
with
the
savings
from
thirty
shillings
a
-
week
,
even
when
Tom
's
probable
savings
were
to
be
added
.
<EOS>
On
this
one
point
there
was
entire
community
of
feeling
in
the
four
widely
differing
beings
who
sat
round
the
dying
fire
of
sticks
,
which
made
a
cheap
warmth
for
them
on
the
verge
of
bedtime
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
carried
the
proud
integrity
of
the
Dodsons
in
her
blood
,
and
had
been
brought
up
to
think
that
to
wrong
people
of
their
money
,
which
was
another
phrase
for
debt
,
was
a
sort
of
moral
pillory
;
it
would
have
been
wickedness
,
to
her
mind
,
to
have
run
counter
to
her
husband
's
desire
to
"
do
the
right
thing
,
"
and
retrieve
his
name
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
confused
,
dreamy
notion
that
,
if
the
creditors
were
all
paid
,
her
plate
and
linen
ought
to
come
back
to
her
;
but
she
had
an
inbred
perception
that
while
people
owed
money
they
were
unable
to
pay
,
they
could
n't
rightly
call
anything
their
own
.
<EOS>
She
murmured
a
little
that
Mr.
Tulliver
so
peremptorily
refused
to
receive
anything
in
repayment
from
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Moss
;
but
to
all
his
requirements
of
household
economy
she
was
submissive
to
the
point
of
denying
herself
the
cheapest
indulgences
of
mere
flavor
;
her
only
rebellion
was
to
smuggle
into
the
kitchen
something
that
would
make
rather
a
better
supper
than
usual
for
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
These
narrow
notions
about
debt
,
held
by
the
old
fashioned
Tullivers
,
may
perhaps
excite
a
smile
on
the
faces
of
many
readers
in
these
days
of
wide
commercial
views
and
wide
philosophy
,
according
to
which
everything
rights
itself
without
any
trouble
of
ours
.
<EOS>
The
fact
that
my
tradesman
is
out
of
pocket
by
me
is
to
be
looked
at
through
the
serene
certainty
that
somebody
else
's
tradesman
is
in
pocket
by
somebody
else
;
and
since
there
must
be
bad
debts
in
the
world
,
why
,
it
is
mere
egoism
not
to
like
that
we
in
particular
should
make
them
instead
of
our
fellow
-
citizens
.
<EOS>
I
am
telling
the
history
of
very
simple
people
,
who
had
never
had
any
illuminating
doubts
as
to
personal
integrity
and
honor
.
  
<EOS>
Under
all
this
grim
melancholy
and
narrowing
concentration
of
desire
,
Mr.
Tulliver
retained
the
feeling
toward
his
"
little
wench
"
which
made
her
presence
a
need
to
him
,
though
it
would
not
suffice
to
cheer
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
still
the
desire
of
his
eyes
;
but
the
sweet
spring
of
fatherly
love
was
now
mingled
with
bitterness
,
like
everything
else
.
<EOS>
When
Maggie
laid
down
her
work
at
night
,
it
was
her
habit
to
get
a
low
stool
and
sit
by
her
father
's
knee
,
leaning
her
cheek
against
it
.
<EOS>
How
she
wished
he
would
stroke
her
head
,
or
give
some
sign
that
he
was
soothed
by
the
sense
that
he
had
a
daughter
who
loved
him
!
<EOS>
But
now
she
got
no
answer
to
her
little
caresses
,
either
from
her
father
or
from
Tom
,
 
the
two
idols
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
Tom
was
weary
and
abstracted
in
the
short
intervals
when
he
was
at
home
,
and
her
father
was
bitterly
preoccupied
with
the
thought
that
the
girl
was
growing
up
,
was
shooting
up
into
a
woman
;
and
how
was
she
to
do
well
in
life
?
<EOS>
She
had
a
poor
chance
for
marrying
,
down
in
the
world
as
they
were
.
<EOS>
And
he
hated
the
thought
of
her
marrying
poorly
,
as
her
aunt
Gritty
had
done
;
_
that
_
would
be
a
thing
to
make
him
turn
in
his
grave
,
 
the
little
wench
so
pulled
down
by
children
and
toil
,
as
her
aunt
Moss
was
.
<EOS>
When
uncultured
minds
,
confined
to
a
narrow
range
of
personal
experience
,
are
under
the
pressure
of
continued
misfortune
,
their
inward
life
is
apt
to
become
a
perpetually
repeated
round
of
sad
and
bitter
thoughts
;
the
same
words
,
the
same
scenes
,
are
revolved
over
and
over
again
,
the
same
mood
accompanies
them
;
the
end
of
the
year
finds
them
as
much
what
they
were
at
the
beginning
as
if
they
were
machines
set
to
a
recurrent
series
of
movements
.
  
<EOS>
The
sameness
of
the
days
was
broken
by
few
visitors
.
<EOS>
Uncles
and
aunts
paid
only
short
visits
now
;
of
course
,
they
could
not
stay
to
meals
,
and
the
constraint
caused
by
Mr.
Tulliver
's
savage
silence
,
which
seemed
to
add
to
the
hollow
resonance
of
the
bare
,
uncarpeted
room
when
the
aunts
were
talking
,
heightened
the
unpleasantness
of
these
family
visits
on
all
sides
,
and
tended
to
make
them
rare
.
<EOS>
As
for
other
acquaintances
,
there
is
a
chill
air
surrounding
those
who
are
down
in
the
world
,
and
people
are
glad
to
get
away
from
them
,
as
from
a
cold
room
;
human
beings
,
mere
men
and
women
,
without
furniture
,
without
anything
to
offer
you
,
who
have
ceased
to
count
as
anybody
,
present
an
embarrassing
negation
of
reasons
for
wishing
to
see
them
,
or
of
subjects
on
which
to
converse
with
them
.
<EOS>
At
that
distant
day
,
there
was
a
dreary
isolation
in
the
civilized
Christian
society
of
these
realms
for
families
that
had
dropped
below
their
original
level
,
unless
they
belonged
to
a
sectarian
church
,
which
gets
some
warmth
of
brotherhood
by
walling
in
the
sacred
fire
.

A
Voice
from
the
Past
  
<EOS>
One
afternoon
,
when
the
chestnuts
were
coming
into
flower
,
Maggie
had
brought
her
chair
outside
the
front
door
,
and
was
seated
there
with
a
book
on
her
knees
.
<EOS>
Her
dark
eyes
had
wandered
from
the
book
,
but
they
did
not
seem
to
be
enjoying
the
sunshine
which
pierced
the
screen
of
jasmine
on
the
projecting
porch
at
her
right
,
and
threw
leafy
shadows
on
her
pale
round
cheek
;
they
seemed
rather
to
be
searching
for
something
that
was
not
disclosed
by
the
sunshine
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
a
more
miserable
day
than
usual
;
her
father
,
after
a
visit
of
Wakem
's
had
had
a
paroxysm
of
rage
,
in
which
for
some
trifling
fault
he
had
beaten
the
boy
who
served
in
the
mill
.
<EOS>
Once
before
,
since
his
illness
,
he
had
had
a
similar
paroxysm
,
in
which
he
had
beaten
his
horse
,
and
the
scene
had
left
a
lasting
terror
in
Maggie
's
mind
.
<EOS>
The
thought
had
risen
,
that
some
time
or
other
he
might
beat
her
mother
if
she
happened
to
speak
in
her
feeble
way
at
the
wrong
moment
.
<EOS>
The
keenest
of
all
dread
with
her
<EOS>
was
lest
her
father
should
add
to
his
present
misfortune
the
wretchedness
of
doing
something
irretrievably
disgraceful
.
<EOS>
The
battered
school
-
book
of
Tom
's
which
she
held
on
her
knees
could
give
her
no
fortitude
under
the
pressure
of
that
dread
;
and
again
and
again
her
eyes
had
filled
with
tears
,
as
they
wandered
vaguely
,
seeing
neither
the
chestnut
-
trees
,
nor
the
distant
horizon
,
but
only
future
scenes
of
home
-
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
she
was
roused
by
the
sound
of
the
opening
gate
and
of
footsteps
on
the
gravel
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
Tom
who
was
entering
,
but
a
man
in
a
sealskin
cap
and
a
blue
plush
waistcoat
,
carrying
a
pack
on
his
back
,
and
followed
closely
by
a
bullterrier
of
brindled
coat
and
defiant
aspect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Bob
,
it
's
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
Maggie
,
starting
up
with
a
smile
of
pleased
recognition
,
for
there
had
been
no
abundance
of
kind
acts
to
efface
the
recollection
of
Bob
's
generosity
;
"
I
'm
so
glad
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Miss
,
"
said
Bob
,
lifting
his
cap
and
showing
a
delighted
face
,
but
immediately
relieving
himself
of
some
accompanying
embarrassment
by
looking
down
at
his
dog
,
and
saying
in
a
tone
of
disgust
,
"
Get
out
wi
'
you
,
you
thunderin
'
sawney
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
brother
is
not
at
home
yet
,
Bob
,
"
said
Maggie
;
"
he
is
always
at
St.
Ogg
's
in
the
daytime
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Miss
,
"
said
Bob
,
"
I
should
be
glad
to
see
Mr.
Tom
,
but
that
is
n't
just
what
I
'm
come
for
,
 
look
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
Bob
was
in
the
act
of
depositing
his
pack
on
the
door
-
step
,
and
with
it
a
row
of
small
books
fastened
together
with
string
.
  
<EOS>
Apparently
,
however
,
they
were
not
the
object
to
which
he
wished
to
call
Maggie
's
attention
,
but
rather
something
which
he
had
carried
under
his
arm
,
wrapped
in
a
red
handkerchief
.
  
<EOS>
"
See
here
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
again
,
laying
the
red
parcel
on
the
others
and
unfolding
it
;
"
you
wo
n't
think
I
'm
a
-
makin
'
too
free
,
<EOS>
Miss
,
I
hope
,
but
I
lighted
on
these
books
,
and
I
thought
they
might
make
up
to
you
a
bit
for
them
as
you
've
lost
;
for
I
heared
you
speak
o
'
picturs
,
 
an
'
as
for
picturs
,
_
look
_
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
opening
of
the
red
handkerchief
had
disclosed
a
superannuated
"
Keepsake
"
and
six
or
seven
numbers
of
a
"
Portrait
Gallery
,
"
in
royal
octavo
;
and
the
emphatic
request
to
look
referred
to
a
portrait
of
George
the
Fourth
in
all
the
majesty
of
his
depressed
cranium
and
voluminous
neckcloth
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
all
sorts
<EOS>
o

genelmen

Bob
went
on
,
turning
over
the
leaves
with
some
excitement
,
"

I

<EOS>
But

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
They
'll
be

Miss

and
the
man
at
the
book

stall
,
he
said
they
banged
iverything
for

he
said
they
was

article

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
've
bought
them
for

,
Bob

"
said
Maggie
,
deeply
touched
by
this
simple
kindness
.
<EOS>
"
How
very
,
very
good
of
you
!
<EOS>
But
I
'm
afraid
you
gave
a
great
deal
of
money
for

"
<EOS>
Not
me

said
Bob

<EOS>
"
I
'd

'll
make

a

was
sold
away
from

<EOS>
Miss.
For
I'n
niver
forgot
how
you
looked
when
you
fretted
about
<EOS>
the
books
bein
'
gone
;
it
's
stuck
by
me
as
if
it
was
a
pictur
hingin

before

An
'
when
I
see'd
the

I

I

the
books
full

"
 
here
Bob
took
up
the
small
stringed
packet
of
books
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
might
like
a
bit
more
print
as
well

said
Bob
,
laying
down
his
pack
again
,
which
he
had
taken
up
with
the
intention
of
hurrying
away
;
for
he
felt
considerable
shyness
in
talking
to
a
young
lass
like
Maggie
,
though
,
as
he
usually
said
of
himself
,
"
his
tongue
overrun

when
he
began
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>

<EOS>
(
Mumps
declined
to
express
himself
more
diffusely
than
by
a
single
affirmative
movement
of
his
tail
.
)
<EOS>
"
But

Eh

that
's
a
pity
;
else
there
's
a
pup
,
 
if
you
did
n't
mind
about
<EOS>
it
not
being
thoroughbred
;
its
mother
acts
in
the
Punch

an
uncommon
sensible
bitch

she
means
more
sense
wi

her
bark
nor
half
the

can
put
into
their
talk

breakfast

<EOS>
There
's
one
chap
carries
pots
,
 
a
poor
,
low
trade
as
any
on
the
road

he
says
,
"

I
wish

"
said
Bob
,
abruptly
taking
up
his
pack
again
,
under
the
consciousness
that
his
tongue
was
acting
in
an
undisciplined
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wo

i

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
pack
was
down
again
,
now
,
the
hook
of
the
stick
having
somehow
gone
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
call
Mumps
a
cur
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Maggie
,
divining
that
any
interest
she
showed
in
Mumps
would
be
gratifying
to
his
master
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Miss
,
a
fine
way
off
that
,
"
said
Bob
,
with
pitying
smile
;
<EOS>
"
Mumps
is
as
fine
a
cross
as
you
'll

does

"
  
<EOS>
The
expression
of
Mump
's
face
,
which
seemed
to
be
tolerating
the
superfluous
existence
of
objects
in
general
,
was
strongly
confirmatory
of
this
high
praise
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
looks
dreadfully
surly
,
"
said
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
he
let
me
pat
him
?

<EOS>
"
Ay

that

he

you

He

He

<EOS>
Lors

I

mischief

I

him

<EOS>
I'n
got
no

what
Mumps
knows
'em
.
<EOS>
He
knows
about
my
big
thumb

he
does

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
big
thumb
 
<EOS>
what
's
that
,
Bob

"
said
Maggie
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
it
is
,
Miss
,
"
said
Bob
,
quickly
,
exhibiting
a
singularly
broad
specimen
of
that
difference
between
the
man
and
the
monkey
.
<EOS>
"
It

it

a

tells
.
<EOS>
I

the

<EOS>
"
  
"
But
Bob
,
"
said
Maggie
,
looking
serious
,
"
that
's
cheating
;
I
do
n't
like
to
hear
you
say
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
you
,
Miss
?
"
said
Bob
regretfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
I
'm
sorry
<EOS>
I
said
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
so
used
to
talking
to
Mumps
,
<EOS>
an
'
he
does
n't
mind
a
bit
o
'
cheating
,
when
it
's
them

Thank

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Miss
,
"
said
Bob
,
moving
on
a
few
steps
;
<EOS>
then
turning
half
round
he
said
,
"
I
'll
leave
off
that
trick
wi
'
my
big
thumb
,
if
you
do

<EOS>
an

what

ud

the
use
o
'
havin'
a
big
thumb
?
<EOS>
It
might
as
well
ha
'
been
narrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
,
thus
exalted
into
Bob
's
exalting
Madonna
,
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
;
at
which
her
worshipper
's
blue
eyes
twinkled
too
,
and
under
these
favoring
auspices
he
touched
his
cap
and
walked
away
.
  
<EOS>
The
days
of
chivalry
are
not
gone
,
notwithstanding
Burke
's
grand
dirge
over
them
;
they
live
still
in
that
far
-
off
worship
paid
by
many
a
youth
and
man
to
the
woman
of
whom
he
never
dreams
that
he
shall
touch
so
much
as
her
little
finger
or
the
hem
of
her
robe
.
<EOS>
Bob
,
with
the
pack
on
his
back
,
had
as
respectful
an
adoration
for
this
dark
-
eyed
maiden
as
if
he
had
been
a
knight
in
armor
calling
aloud
on
her
name
as
he
pricked
on
to
the
fight
.
  
<EOS>
That
gleam
of
merriment
soon
died
away
from
Maggie
's
face
,
and
perhaps
only
made
the
returning
gloom
deeper
by
contrast
.
<EOS>
She
was
too
dispirited
even
to
like
answering
questions
about
Bob
's
present
of
books
,
and
she
carried
them
away
to
her
bedroom
,
laying
them
down
there
and
seating
herself
on
her
one
stool
,
without
caring
to
look
at
them
just
yet
.
<EOS>
She
leaned
her
cheek
against
the
window
-
frame
,
and
thought
that
the
light
-
hearted
Bob
had
a
lot
much
happier
than
hers
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
sense
of
loneliness
,
and
utter
privation
of
joy
,
had
deepened
with
the
brightness
of
advancing
spring
.
<EOS>
All
the
favorite
outdoor
nooks
about
home
,
which
seemed
to
have
done
their
part
with
her
parents
in
nurturing
and
cherishing
her
,
were
now
mixed
up
with
the
home
-
sadness
,
and
gathered
no
smile
from
the
sunshine
.
<EOS>
Every
affection
,
every
delight
the
poor
child
had
had
,
was
like
an
aching
nerve
to
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
music
for
her
any
more
,
 
no
piano
,
no
harmonized
voices
,
no
delicious
stringed
instruments
,
with
their
passionate
cries
of
imprisoned
spirits
sending
a
strange
vibration
through
her
frame
.
<EOS>
And
of
all
her
school
-
life
there
was
nothing
left
her
now
<EOS>
but
her
little
collection
of
school
-
books
,
which
she
turned
over
with
a
sickening
sense
that
she
knew
them
all
,
and
they
were
all
barren
of
comfort
.
<EOS>
Even
at
school
she
had
often
wished
for
books
with
_
more
_
in
them
;
everything
she
learned
there
seemed
like
the
ends
of
long
threads
that
snapped
immediately
.
<EOS>
And
now
 
without
the
indirect
charm
of
school
-
emulation
 
Télémaque
was
mere
bran
;
so
were
the
hard
,
dry
questions
on
Christian
Doctrine
;
there
was
no
flavor
in
them
,
no
strength
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
Maggie
thought
she
could
have
been
contented
with
absorbing
fancies
;
if
she
could
have
had
all
Scott
's
novels
and
all
Byron
's
poems
!
 
<EOS>
then
,
perhaps
,
she
might
have
found
happiness
enough
to
dull
her
sensibility
to
her
actual
daily
life
.
<EOS>
And
yet
they
were
hardly
what
she
wanted
.
<EOS>
She
could
make
dream
-
worlds
of
her
own
,
but
no
dream
-
world
would
satisfy
her
now
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
some
explanation
of
this
hard
,
real
life
,
 
the
unhappy
-
looking
father
,
seated
at
the
dull
breakfast
-
table
;
the
childish
,
bewildered
mother
;
the
little
sordid
tasks
that
filled
the
hours
,
or
the
more
oppressive
emptiness
of
weary
,
joyless
leisure
;
the
need
of
some
tender
,
demonstrative
love
;
the
cruel
sense
that
Tom
did
n't
mind
what
she
thought
or
felt
,
and
that
they
were
no
longer
playfellows
together
;
the
privation
of
all
pleasant
things
that
had
come
to
_
her
_
more
than
to
others
,
 
she
wanted
some
key
that
would
enable
her
to
understand
,
and
in
understanding
,
to
endure
,
the
heavy
weight
that
had
fallen
on
her
young
heart
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
been
taught
"
real
learning
and
wisdom
,
such
as
great
men
knew
,
"
she
thought
she
should
have
held
the
secrets
of
life
;
if
she
had
only
books
,
that
she
might
learn
for
herself
what
wise
men
knew
!
<EOS>
Saints
and
martyrs
had
never
interested
Maggie
so
much
as
sages
and
poets
.
<EOS>
She
knew
little
of
saints
and
martyrs
,
and
had
gathered
,
as
a
general
result
of
her
teaching
,
that
they
were
a
temporary
provision
against
the
spread
of
Catholicism
,
and
had
all
died
at
Smithfield
.
  
<EOS>
In
one
of
these
meditations
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
had
forgotten
Tom
's
school
-
books
,
which
had
been
sent
home
in
his
trunk
.
<EOS>
But
she
found
the
stock
unaccountably
shrunk
down
to
the
few
old
ones
which
had
been
well
thumbed
,
 
the
Latin
Dictionary
and
Grammar
,
a
Delectus
,
a
torn
Eutropius
,
the
well
-
worn
Virgil
,
Aldrich
's
Logic
,
and
the
exasperating
Euclid
.
<EOS>
Still
,
Latin
,
Euclid
,
and
Logic
would
surely
be
a
considerable
step
in
masculine
wisdom
,
 
in
that
knowledge
which
made
men
contented
,
and
even
glad
to
live
.
<EOS>
Not
that
the
yearning
for
effectual
wisdom
was
quite
unmixed
;
a
certain
mirage
would
now
and
then
rise
on
the
desert
of
the
future
,
in
which
she
seemed
to
see
herself
honored
for
her
surprising
attainments
.
<EOS>
And
so
the
poor
child
,
with
her
soul
's
hunger
and
her
illusions
of
self
-
flattery
,
began
to
nibble
at
this
thick
-
rinded
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
,
filling
her
vacant
hours
with
Latin
,
geometry
,
and
the
forms
of
the
syllogism
,
and
feeling
a
gleam
of
triumph
now
and
then
that
her
understanding
was
quite
equal
to
these
peculiarly
masculine
studies
.
<EOS>
For
a
week
or
two
she
went
on
resolutely
enough
,
though
with
an
occasional
sinking
of
heart
,
as
if
she
had
set
out
toward
the
Promised
Land
alone
,
and
found
it
a
thirsty
,
trackless
,
uncertain
journey
.
<EOS>
In
the
severity
of
her
early
resolution
,
she
would
take
Aldrich
out
into
the
fields
,
and
then
look
off
her
book
toward
the
sky
,
where
the
lark
was
twinkling
,
or
to
the
reeds
and
bushes
by
the
river
,
from
which
the
waterfowl
rustled
forth
on
its
anxious
,
awkward
flight
,
 
with
a
startled
sense
that
the
relation
between
Aldrich
and
this
living
world
was
extremely
remote
for
her
.
<EOS>
The
discouragement
deepened
as
the
days
went
on
,
and
the
eager
heart
gained
faster
and
faster
on
the
patient
mind
.
<EOS>
Somehow
,
when
she
sat
at
the
window
with
her
book
,
her
eyes
_
would
_
fix
themselves
blankly
on
the
outdoor
sunshine
;
then
they
would
fill
with
tears
,
and
sometimes
,
if
her
mother
was
not
in
the
room
,
the
studies
would
all
end
in
sobbing
.
<EOS>
She
rebelled
against
her
lot
,
she
fainted
under
its
loneliness
,
and
fits
even
of
anger
and
hatred
toward
her
father
and
mother
,
who
were
so
unlike
what
she
would
have
them
to
be
;
toward
Tom
,
who
checked
her
,
and
met
her
thought
or
feeling
always
by
some
thwarting
difference
,
 
would
flow
out
over
her
affections
and
conscience
like
a
lava
stream
,
and
frighten
her
with
a
sense
that
it
was
not
difficult
for
her
to
become
a
demon
.
<EOS>
Then
her
brain
would
be
busy
with
wild
romances
of
a
flight
from
home
in
search
of
something
less
sordid
and
dreary
;
she
would
go
to
some
great
man
 
Walter
Scott
,
perhaps
 
and
tell
him
how
wretched
and
how
clever
she
was
,
and
he
would
surely
do
something
for
her
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
middle
of
her
vision
,
her
father
would
perhaps
enter
the
room
for
the
evening
,
and
,
surprised
that
she
sat
still
without
noticing
him
,
would
say
complainingly
,
"
Come
,
am
I
to
fetch
my
slippers
myself
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
voice
pierced
through
Maggie
like
a
sword
;
there
was
another
sadness
besides
her
own
,
and
she
had
been
thinking
of
turning
her
back
on
it
and
forsaking
it
.
  
<EOS>
This
afternoon
,
the
sight
of
Bob
's
cheerful
freckled
face
had
given
her
discontent
a
new
direction
.
<EOS>
She
thought
it
was
part
of
the
hardship
of
her
life
that
there
was
laid
upon
her
the
burthen
of
larger
wants
than
others
seemed
to
feel
,
 
that
she
had
to
endure
this
wide
,
hopeless
yearning
for
that
something
,
whatever
it
was
,
that
was
greatest
and
best
on
this
earth
.
<EOS>
She
wished
she
could
have
been
like
Bob
,
with
his
easily
satisfied
ignorance
,
or
like
Tom
,
who
had
something
to
do
on
which
he
could
fix
his
mind
with
a
steady
purpose
,
and
disregard
everything
else
.
<EOS>
Poor
child
!
<EOS>
as
she
leaned
her
head
against
the
window
-
frame
,
with
her
hands
clasped
tighter
and
tighter
,
and
her
foot
beating
the
ground
,
she
was
as
lonely
in
her
trouble
as
if
she
had
been
the
only
girl
in
the
civilized
world
of
that
day
who
had
come
out
of
her
school
-
life
with
a
soul
untrained
for
inevitable
struggles
,
with
no
other
part
of
her
inherited
share
in
the
hard
-
won
treasures
of
thought
which
generations
of
painful
toil
have
laid
up
for
the
race
of
men
,
than
shreds
and
patches
of
feeble
literature
and
false
history
,
with
much
futile
information
about
Saxon
and
other
kings
of
doubtful
example
,
but
unhappily
quite
without
that
knowledge
of
the
irreversible
laws
within
and
without
her
,
which
,
governing
the
habits
,
becomes
morality
,
and
developing
the
feelings
of
submission
and
dependence
,
becomes
religion
,
 
as
lonely
in
her
trouble
as
if
every
other
girl
besides
herself
had
been
cherished
and
watched
over
by
elder
minds
,
not
forgetful
of
their
own
early
time
,
when
need
was
keen
and
impulse
strong
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
Maggie
's
eyes
glanced
down
on
the
books
that
lay
on
the
window
-
shelf
,
and
she
half
forsook
her
reverie
to
turn
over
listlessly
the
leaves
of
the
"
Portrait
Gallery
,
"
but
she
soon
pushed
this
aside
to
examine
the
little
row
of
books
tied
together
with
string
.
<EOS>
"
Beauties
of
the
Spectator
,
"
"
Rasselas
,
"
"
Economy
of
Human
Life
,
"
"
Gregory
's
Letters
,
"
 
<EOS>
she
knew
the
sort
of
matter
that
was
inside
all
these
;
the
"
Christian
Year
,
"
 
that
seemed
to
be
a
hymnbook
,
and
she
laid
it
down
again
;
but
_
Thomas
à
Kempis
?
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
the
name
had
come
across
her
in
her
reading
,
and
she
felt
the
satisfaction
,
which
every
one
knows
,
of
getting
some
ideas
to
attach
to
a
name
that
strays
solitary
in
the
memory
.
<EOS>
She
took
up
the
little
,
old
,
clumsy
book
with
some
curiosity
;
it
had
the
corners
turned
down
in
many
places
,
and
some
hand
,
now
forever
quiet
,
had
made
at
certain
passages
strong
pen
-
and
-
ink
marks
,
long
since
browned
by
time
.
<EOS>
Maggie
turned
from
leaf
to
leaf
,
and
read
where
the
quiet
hand
pointed
:
"
Know
that
the
love
of
thyself
doth
hurt
thee
more
than
anything
in
the
world
....
<EOS>
If
thou
seekest
this
or
that
,
and
wouldst
be
here
or
there
to
enjoy
thy
own
will
and
pleasure
,
thou
shalt
never
be
quiet
nor
free
from
care
;
for
in
everything
somewhat
will
be
wanting
,
and
in
every
place
there
will
be
some
that
will
cross
thee
....
<EOS>
Both
above
and
below
,
which
way
soever
thou
dost
turn
thee
,
everywhere
thou
shalt
find
the
Cross
;
and
everywhere
of
necessity
thou
must
have
patience
,
if
thou
wilt
have
inward
peace
,
and
enjoy
an
everlasting
crown
....
<EOS>
If
thou
desirest
to
mount
unto
this
height
,
thou
must
set
out
courageously
,
and
lay

inordinate

all
private
and
earthly
good

<EOS>
On
this
sin
,
that
a
man
inordinately
loveth
himself
,
almost
all
dependeth
,
whatsoever
is
thoroughly

there

It

little
thou
sufferest

so
much

,
were
so
strongly
tempted

so
grievously
afflicted

so
many

the

thou

thy
little
adversities

And

little

beware

thy

Blessed

those

Blessed
are

A
strange
thrill
of
awe
passed
through
Maggie
while
she
read
,
as
if
she
had
been
wakened
in
the
night
by
a
strain
of
solemn
music
,
telling
of
beings
whose
souls
had
been
astir
while
hers
was
in
stupor
.
<EOS>
She
went
on
from
one
brown
mark
to
another
,
where
the
quiet
hand
seemed
to
point
,
hardly
conscious
that
she
was
reading
,
seeming
rather
to
listen
while
a
low
voice
said
;
  
"
<EOS>
Why
dost
thou
here
gaze
about
,
since
this
is
not
the
place
of
thy
rest
?
<EOS>
In
heaven
ought
to
be
thy
dwelling
,
and
all
earthly
things
are
to
be
looked
on
as
they
forward
thy
journey
thither
.
<EOS>
All
things
pass
away
,
and
thou
together
with
them
.
<EOS>
Beware
thou
cleavest
not
unto
them
,
lest
thou
be
entangled
and
perish
....
<EOS>
If
a
man
should
give
all
his
substance
,
yet
it
is
as
nothing
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
should
do
great
penances
,
yet
are
they
but
little
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
should
attain
to
all
knowledge
,
he
is
yet
far
off
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
should
be
of
great
virtue
,
and
very
fervent
devotion
,
yet
is
there
much
wanting
;
to
wit
,
one
thing
,
which
is
most
necessary
for
him
.
<EOS>
What
is
that
?
<EOS>
That
having
left
all
,
he
leave
himself
,
and
go
wholly
out
of
himself
,
and
retain
nothing
of
self
-
love
....
<EOS>
I
have
often
said
unto
thee
,
and
now
again
I
say
the
same
,
Forsake
thyself
,
resign
thyself
,
and
thou
shalt
enjoy
much
inward
peace
....
<EOS>
Then
shall
all
vain
imaginations
,
evil
perturbations
,
and
superfluous
cares
fly
away
;
then
shall
immoderate
fear
leave
thee
,
and
inordinate
love
shall
die
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
drew
a
long
breath
and
pushed
her
heavy
hair
back
,
as
if
to
see
a
sudden
vision
more
clearly
.
<EOS>
Here
,
then
,
was
a
secret
of
life
that
would
enable
her
to
renounce
all
other
secrets
;
here
was
a
sublime
height
to
be
reached
without
the
help
of
outward
things
;
here
was
insight
,
and
strength
,
and
conquest
,
to
be
won
by
means
entirely
within
her
own
soul
,
where
a
supreme
Teacher
was
waiting
to
be
heard
.
<EOS>
It
flashed
through
her
like
the
suddenly
apprehended
solution
of
a
problem
,
that
all
the
miseries
of
her
young
life
had
come
from
fixing
her
heart
on
her
own
pleasure
,
as
if
that
were
the
central
necessity
of
the
universe
;
and
for
the
first
time
she
saw
the
possibility
of
shifting
the
position
from
which
she
looked
at
the
gratification
of
her
own
desires
,
 
of
taking
her
stand
out
of
herself
,
and
looking
at
her
own
life
as
an
insignificant
part
of
a
divinely
guided
whole
.
<EOS>
She
read
on
and
on
in
the
old
book
,
devouring
eagerly
the
dialogues
with
the
invisible
Teacher
,
the
pattern
of
sorrow
,
the
source
of
all
strength
;
returning
to
it
after
she
had
been
called
away
,
and
reading
till
the
sun
went
down
behind
the
willows
.
<EOS>
With
all
the
hurry
of
an
imagination
that
could
never
rest
in
the
present
,
she
sat
in
the
deepening
twilight
forming
plans
of
self
-
humiliation
and
entire
devotedness
;
and
in
the
ardor
of
first
discovery
,
renunciation
seemed
to
her
the
entrance
into
that
satisfaction
which
she
had
so
long
been
craving
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
perceived
 
how
could
she
until
she
had
lived
longer
?
 
<EOS>
the
inmost
truth
of
the
old
monk
's
out
-
pourings
,
that
renunciation
remains
sorrow
,
though
a
sorrow
borne
willingly
.
<EOS>
Maggie
was
still
panting
for
happiness
,
and
was
in
ecstasy
because
she
had
found
the
key
to
it
.
<EOS>
She
knew
nothing
of
doctrines
and
systems
,
of
mysticism
or
quietism
;
but
this
voice
out
of
the
far
-
off
middle
ages
was
the
direct
communication
of
a
human
soul
's
belief
and
experience
,
and
came
to
Maggie
as
an
unquestioned
message
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
that
is
the
reason
why
the
small
old
-
fashioned
book
,
for
which
you
need
only
pay
sixpence
at
a
book
-
stall
,
works
miracles
to
this
day
,
turning
bitter
waters
into
sweetness
;
while
expensive
sermons
and
treatises
,
newly
issued
,
leave
all
things
as
they
were
before
.
<EOS>
It
was
written
down
by
a
hand
that
waited
for
the
heart
's
prompting
;
it
is
the
chronicle
of
a
solitary
,
hidden
anguish
,
struggle
,
trust
,
and
triumph
,
not
written
on
velvet
cushions
to
teach
endurance
to
those
who
are
treading
with
bleeding
feet
on
the
stones
.
<EOS>
And
so
it
remains
to
all
time
a
lasting
record
of
human
needs
and
human
consolations
;
the
voice
of
a
brother
who
,
ages
ago
,
felt
and
suffered
and
renounced
,
 
in
the
cloister
,
perhaps
,
with
serge
gown
and
tonsured
head
,
with
much
chanting
and
long
fasts
,
and
with
a
fashion
of
speech
different
from
ours
,
 
but
under
the
same
silent
far
-
off
heavens
,
and
with
the
same
passionate
desires
,
the
same
strivings
,
the
same
failures
,
the
same
weariness
.
  
<EOS>
In
writing
the
history
of
unfashionable
families
,
one
is
apt
to
fall
into
a
tone
of
emphasis
which
is
very
far
from
being
the
tone
of
good
society
,
where
principles
and
beliefs
are
not
only
of
an
extremely
moderate
kind
,
but
are
always
presupposed
,
no
subjects
being
eligible
but
such
as
can
be
touched
with
a
light
and
graceful
irony
.
<EOS>
But
then
good
society
has
its
claret
and
its
velvet
carpets
,
its
dinner
-
engagements
<EOS>
six
weeks
deep
,
its
opera
and
its
faëry
ball
-
rooms
;
rides
off
its
_
ennui
_
on
thoroughbred
horses
;
lounges
at
the
club
;
has
to
keep
clear
of
crinoline
vortices
;
gets
its
science
done
by
Faraday
,
and
its
religion
by
the
superior
clergy
who
are
to
be
met
in
the
best
houses
,
 
how
should
it
have
time
or
need
for
belief
and
emphasis
?
<EOS>
But
good
society
,
floated
on
gossamer
wings
of
light
irony
,
is
of
very
expensive
production
;
requiring
nothing
less
than
a
wide
and
arduous
national
life
condensed
in
unfragrant
deafening
factories
,
cramping
itself
in
mines
,
sweating
at
furnaces
,
grinding
,
hammering
,
weaving
under
more
or
less
oppression
of
carbonic
acid
,
or
else
,
spread
over
sheepwalks
,
and
scattered
in
lonely
houses
and
huts
on
the
clayey
or
chalky
corn
-
lands
,
where
the
rainy
days
look
dreary
.
<EOS>
This
wide
national
life
is
based
entirely
on
emphasis
,
 
the
emphasis
of
want
,
which
urges
it
into
all
the
activities
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
good
society
and
light
irony
;
it
spends
its
heavy
years
often
in
a
chill
,
uncarpeted
fashion
,
amidst
family
discord
unsoftened
by
long
corridors
.
<EOS>
Under
such
circumstances
,
there
are
many
among
its
myriads
of
souls
who
have
absolutely
needed
an
emphatic
belief
,
life
in
this
unpleasurable
shape
demanding
some
solution
even
to
unspeculative
minds
,
 
just
as
you
inquire
into
the
stuffing
of
your
couch
when
anything
galls
you
there
,
whereas
eider
-
down
and
perfect
French
springs
excite
no
question
.
<EOS>
Some
have
an
emphatic
belief
in
alcohol
,
and
seek
their
_
ekstasis
_
or
outside
standing
-
ground
in
gin
;
but
the
rest
require
something
that
good
society
calls
"
enthusiasm
,
"
something
that
will
present
motives
in
an
entire
absence
of
high
prizes
;
something
that
will
give
patience
and
feed
human
love
when
the
limbs
ache
with
weariness
,
and
human
looks
are
hard
upon
us
;
something
,
clearly
,
that
lies
outside
personal
desires
,
that
includes
resignation
for
ourselves
and
active
love
for
what
is
not
ourselves
.
<EOS>
Now
and
then
that
sort
of
enthusiasm
finds
a
far
-
echoing
voice
that
comes
from
an
experience
springing
out
of
the
deepest
need
;
and
it
was
by
being
brought
within
the
long
lingering
vibrations
of
such
a
voice
that
Maggie
,
with
her
girl
's
face
and
unnoted
sorrows
,
found
an
effort
and
a
hope
that
helped
her
through
years
of
loneliness
,
making
out
a
faith
for
herself
without
the
aid
of
established
authorities
and
appointed
guides
;
for
they
were
not
at
hand
,
and
her
need
was
pressing
.
<EOS>
From
what
you
know
of
her
,
you
will
not
be
surprised
that
she
threw
some
exaggeration
and
wilfulness
,
some
pride
and
impetuosity
,
even
into
her
self
-
renunciation
;
her
own
life
was
still
a
drama
for
her
,
in
which
she
demanded
of
herself
that
her
part
should
be
played
with
intensity
.
<EOS>
And
so
it
came
to
pass
that
she
often
lost
the
spirit
of
humility
by
being
excessive
in
the
outward
act
;
she
often
strove
after
too
high
a
flight
,
and
came
down
with
her
poor
little
half
-
fledged
wings
dabbled
in
the
mud
.
<EOS>
For
example
,
she
not
only
determined
to
work
at
plain
sewing
,
that
she
might
contribute
something
toward
the
fund
in
the
tin
box
,
but
she
went
,
in
the
first
instance
,
in
her
zeal
of
self
-
mortification
,
to
ask
for
it
at
a
linen
shop
in
St.
Ogg
's
,
instead
of
getting
it
in
a
more
quiet
and
indirect
way
;
and
could
see
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
was
entirely
wrong
and
unkind
,
nay
,
persecuting
,
in
Tom
's
reproof
of
her
for
this
unnecessary
act
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
_
my
_
sister
to
do
such
things
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
_
<EOS>
I
'll
_
take
care
that
the
debts
are
paid
,
without
your
lowering
yourself
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Surely
there
was
some
tenderness
and
bravery
mingled
with
the
worldliness
and
self
-
assertion
of
that
little
speech
;
but
Maggie
held
it
as
dross
,
overlooking
the
grains
of
gold
,
and
took
Tom
's
rebuke
as
one
of
her
outward
crosses
.
<EOS>
Tom
was
very
hard
to
her
,
she
used
to
think
,
in
her
long
night
-
watchings
,
 
to
her
who
had
always
loved
him
so
;
and
then
she
strove
to
be
contented
with
that
hardness
,
and
to
require
nothing
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
path
we
all
like
when
we
set
out
on
our
abandonment
of
egoism
,
 
the
path
of
martyrdom
and
endurance
,
where
the
palm
-
branches
grow
,
rather
than
the
steep
highway
of
tolerance
,
just
allowance
,
and
self
-
blame
,
where
there
are
no
leafy
honors
to
be
gathered
and
worn
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
books
,
Virgil
,
Euclid
,
and
Aldrich
 
that
wrinkled
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
 
had
been
all
laid
by
;
for
Maggie
had
turned
her
back
on
the
vain
ambition
to
share
the
thoughts
of
the
wise
.
<EOS>
In
her
first
ardor
she
flung
away
the
books
with
a
sort
of
triumph
that
she
had
risen
above
the
need
of
them
;
and
if
they
had
been
her
own
,
she
would
have
burned
them
,
believing
that
she
would
never
repent
.
<EOS>
She
read
so
eagerly
and
constantly
in
her
three
books
,
the
Bible
,
Thomas
à
Kempis
,
and
the
"
Christian
Year
"
(
no
longer
rejected
as
a
"
hymn
-
book
"
)
,
that
they
filled
her
mind
with
a
continual
stream
of
rhythmic
memories
;
and
she
was
too
ardently
learning
to
see
all
nature
and
life
in
the
light
of
her
new
faith
,
to
need
any
other
material
for
her
mind
to
work
on
,
as
she
sat
with
her
well
-
plied
needle
,
making
shirts
and
other
complicated
stitchings
,
falsely
called
"
plain
,
"
 
by
no
means
plain
to
Maggie
,
since
wristband
and
sleeve
and
the
like
had
a
capability
of
being
sewed
in
wrong
side
outward
in
moments
of
mental
wandering
.
  
<EOS>
Hanging
diligently
over
her
sewing
,
Maggie
was
a
sight
any
one
might
have
been
pleased
to
look
at
.
<EOS>
That
new
inward
life
of
hers
,
notwithstanding
some
volcanic
upheavings
of
imprisoned
passions
,
yet
shone
out
in
her
face
with
a
tender
soft
light
that
mingled
itself
as
added
loveliness
with
the
gradually
enriched
color
and
outline
of
her
blossoming
youth
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
felt
the
change
in
her
with
a
sort
of
puzzled
wonder
that
Maggie
should
be
"
growing
up
so
good
"
;
it
was
amazing
that
this
once
"
contrairy
"
child
was
become
so
submissive
,
so
backward
to
assert
her
own
will
.
<EOS>
Maggie
used
to
look
up
from
her
work
and
find
her
mother
's
eyes
fixed
upon
her
;
they
were
watching
and
waiting
for
the
large
young
glance
,
as
if
her
elder
frame
got
some
needful
warmth
from
it
.
<EOS>
The
mother
was
getting
fond
of
her
tall
,
brown
girl
,
 
the
only
bit
of
furniture
now
on
which
she
could
bestow
her
anxiety
and
pride
;
and
Maggie
,
in
spite
of
her
own
ascetic
wish
to
have
no
personal
adornment
,
was
obliged
to
give
way
to
her
mother
about
her
hair
,
and
submit
to
have
the
abundant
black
locks
plaited
into
a
coronet
on
the
summit
of
her
head
,
after
the
pitiable
fashion
of
those
antiquated
times
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
your
mother
have
that
bit
<EOS>
o
'
pleasure
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
;
"
I
'd
trouble
enough
with
your
hair
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
Maggie
,
glad
of
anything
that
would
soothe
her
mother
,
and
cheer
their
long
day
together
,
consented
to
the
vain
decoration
,
and
showed
a
queenly
head
above
her
old
frocks
,
steadily
refusing
,
however
,
to
look
at
herself
in
the
glass
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
liked
to
call
the
father
's
attention
to
Maggie
's
hair
and
other
unexpected
virtues
,
but
he
had
a
brusk
reply
to
give
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
well
enough
what
she
'd
be
,
before
now
,
 
<EOS>
it
's
nothing
new
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
a
pity
<EOS>
she
is
n't
made
o
'
commoner
stuff
;
she
'll
be
thrown
away
,
I
doubt
,
 
there
'll
be
nobody
to
marry
her
as
is
fit
for
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
Maggie
's
graces
of
mind
and
body
fed
his
gloom
.
<EOS>
He
sat
patiently
enough
while
she
read
him
a
chapter
,
or
said
something
timidly
when
they
were
alone
together
about
trouble
being
turned
into
a
blessing
.
<EOS>
He
took
it
all
as
part
of
his
daughter
's
goodness
,
which
made
his
misfortunes
the
sadder
to
him
because
they
damaged
her
chance
in
life
.
<EOS>
In
a
mind
charged
with
an
eager
purpose
and
an
unsatisfied
vindictiveness
,
there
is
no
room
for
new
feelings
;
Mr.
Tulliver
did
not
want
spiritual
consolation
 
<EOS>
he
wanted
to
shake
off
the
degradation
of
debt
,
and
to
have
his
revenge
.

In
the

<EOS>
The
family
sitting
-
room
was
a
long
room
with
a
window
at
each
end
;
one
looking
toward
the
croft
and
along
the
Ripple
to
the
banks
of
the
Floss
,
the
other
into
the
mill
-
yard
.
<EOS>
Maggie
was
sitting
with
her
work
against
the
latter
window
when
she
saw
Mr.
Wakem
entering
the
yard
,
as
usual
,
on
his
fine
black
horse
;
but
not
alone
,
as
usual
.
<EOS>
Some
one
was
with
him
,
 
a
figure
in
a
cloak
,
on
a
handsome
pony
.
<EOS>
Maggie
had
hardly
time
to
feel
that
it
was
Philip
come
back
,
before
they
were
in
front
of
the
window
,
and
he
was
raising
his
hat
to
her
;
while
his
father
,
catching
the
movement
by
a
side
-
glance
,
looked
sharply
round
at
them
both
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
hurried
away
from
the
window
and
carried
her
work
upstairs
;
for
Mr.
Wakem
sometimes
came
in
and
inspected
the
books
,
and
Maggie
felt
that
the
meeting
with
Philip
would
be
robbed
of
all
pleasure
in
the
presence
of
the
two
fathers
.
<EOS>
Some
day
,
perhaps
,
she
could
see
him
when
they
could
just
shake
hands
,
and
she
could
tell
him
that
she
remembered
his
goodness
to
Tom
,
and
the
things
he
had
said
to
her
in
the
old
days
,
though
they
could
never
be
friends
any
more
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
at
all
agitating
to
Maggie
to
see
Philip
again
;
she
retained
her
childish
gratitude
and
pity
toward
him
,
and
remembered
his
cleverness
;
and
in
the
early
weeks
of
her
loneliness
she
had
continually
recalled
the
image
of
him
among
the
people
who
had
been
kind
to
her
in
life
,
often
wishing
she
had
him
for
a
brother
and
a
teacher
,
as
they
had
fancied
it
might
have
been
,
in
their
talk
together
.
<EOS>
But
that
sort
of
wishing
had
been
banished
along
with
other
dreams
that
savored
of
seeking
her
own
will
;
and
she
thought
,
besides
,
that
Philip
might
be
altered
by
his
life
abroad
,
 
he
might
have
become
worldly
,
and
really
not
care
about
her
saying
anything
to
him
now
.
<EOS>
And
yet
his
face
was
wonderfully
little
altered
,
 
it
was
only
a
larger
,
more
manly
copy
of
the
pale
,
small
-
featured
boy
's
face
,
with
the
gray
eyes
,
and
the
boyish
waving
brown
hair
;
there
was
the
old
deformity
to
awaken
the
old
pity
;
and
after
all
her
meditations
,
Maggie
felt
that
she
really
_
should
_
like
to
say
a
few
words
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
might
still
be
melancholy
,
as
he
always
used
to
be
,
and
like
her
to
look
at
him
kindly
.
<EOS>
She
wondered
if
he
remembered
how
he
used
to
like
her
eyes
;
with
that
thought
Maggie
glanced
toward
the
square
looking
-
glass
which
was
condemned
to
hang
with
its
face
toward
the
wall
,
and
she
half
started
from
her
seat
to
reach
it
down
;
but
she
checked
herself
and
snatched
up
her
work
,
trying
to
repress
the
rising
wishes
by
forcing
her
memory
to
recall
snatches
of
hymns
,
until
she
saw
Philip
and
his
father
returning
along
the
road
,
and
she
could
go
down
again
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
far
on
in
June
now
,
and
Maggie
was
inclined
to
lengthen
the
daily
walk
which
was
her
one
indulgence
;
but
this
day
and
the
following
she
was
so
busy
with
work
which
must
be
finished
that
she
never
went
beyond
the
gate
,
and
satisfied
her
need
of
the
open
air
by
sitting
out
of
doors
.
<EOS>
One
of
her
frequent
walks
,
when
she
was
not
obliged
to
go
to
St.
Ogg
's
,
was
to
a
spot
that
lay
beyond
what
was
called
the
"
Hill
,
"
 
an
insignificant
rise
of
ground
crowned
by
trees
,
lying
along
the
side
of
the
road
which
ran
by
the
gates
of
Dorlcote
Mill
.
<EOS>
Insignificant
I
call
it
,
because
in
height
it
was
hardly
more
than
a
bank
;
but
there
may
come
moments
when
Nature
makes
a
mere
bank
a
means
toward
a
fateful
result
;
and
that
is
why
I
ask
you
to
imagine
this
high
bank
crowned
with
trees
,
making
an
uneven
wall
for
some
quarter
of
a
mile
along
the
left
side
of
Dorlcote
Mill
and
<EOS>
the
pleasant
fields
behind
it
,
bounded
by
the
murmuring
Ripple
.
<EOS>
Just
where
this
line
of
bank
sloped
down
again
to
the
level
,
a
by
-
road
turned
off
and
led
to
the
other
side
of
the
rise
,
where
it
was
broken
into
very
capricious
hollows
and
mounds
by
the
working
of
an
exhausted
stone
-
quarry
,
so
long
exhausted
that
both
mounds
and
hollows
were
now
clothed
with
brambles
and
trees
,
and
here
and
there
by
a
stretch
of
grass
which
a
few
sheep
kept
close
-
nibbled
.
<EOS>
In
her
childish
days
Maggie
held
this
place
,
called
the
Red
Deeps
,
in
very
great
awe
,
and
needed
all
her
confidence
in
Tom
's
bravery
to
reconcile
her
to
an
excursion
thither
,
 
visions
of
robbers
and
fierce
animals
haunting
every
hollow
.
<EOS>
But
now
it
had
the
charm
for
her
which
any
broken
ground
,
any
mimic
rock
and
ravine
,
have
for
the
eyes
that
rest
habitually
on
the
level
;
especially
in
summer
,
when
she
could
sit
on
a
grassy
hollow
under
the
shadow
of
a
branching
ash
,
stooping
aslant
from
the
steep
above
her
,
and
listen
to
the
hum
of
insects
,
like
tiniest
bells
on
the
garment
of
Silence
,
or
see
the
sunlight
piercing
the
distant
boughs
,
as
if
to
chase
and
drive
home
the
truant
heavenly
blue
of
the
wild
hyacinths
.
<EOS>
In
this
June
time
,
too
,
the
dog
-
roses
were
in
their
glory
,
and
that
was
an
additional
reason
why
Maggie
should
direct
her
walk
to
the
Red
Deeps
,
rather
than
to
any
other
spot
,
<EOS>
on
the
first
day
she
was
free
to
wander
at
her
will
,
 
a
pleasure
she
loved
so
well
,
that
sometimes
,
in
her
ardors
of
renunciation
,
she
thought
she
ought
to
deny
herself
the
frequent
indulgence
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
see
her
now
,
as
she
walks
down
the
favorite
turning
and
enters
the
Deeps
by
a
narrow
path
through
a
group
of
Scotch
firs
,
her
tall
figure
and
old
lavender
gown
visible
through
an
hereditary
black
silk
shawl
of
some
wide
-
meshed
net
-
like
material
;
and
now
she
is
sure
of
being
unseen
<EOS>
she
takes
off
her
bonnet
and
ties
it
over
her
arm
.
<EOS>
One
would
certainly
suppose
her
to
be
farther
on
in
life
than
her
seventeenth
year
 
perhaps
because
of
the
slow
resigned
sadness
of
the
glance
from
which
all
search
and
unrest
seem
to
have
departed
;
perhaps
because
her
broad
-
chested
figure
has
the
mould
of
early
womanhood
.
<EOS>
Youth
and
health
have
withstood
well
the
involuntary
and
voluntary
hardships
of
her
lot
,
and
the
nights
in
which
she
has
lain
on
the
hard
floor
for
a
penance
have
left
no
obvious
trace
;
the
eyes
are
liquid
,
the
brown
cheek
is
firm
and
round
,
the
full
lips
are
red
.
<EOS>
With
her
dark
coloring
and
jet
crown
surmounting
her
tall
figure
,
she
seems
to
have
a
sort
of
kinship
with
the
grand
Scotch
firs
,
at
which
she
is
looking
up
as
if
she
loved
them
well
.
<EOS>
Yet
one
has
a
sense
of
uneasiness
in
looking
at
her
,
 
a
sense
of
opposing
elements
,
of
which
a
fierce
collision
is
imminent
;
surely
there
is
a
hushed
expression
,
such
as
one
often
sees
in
older
faces
under
borderless
caps
,
<EOS>
out
of
keeping
with
the
resistant
youth
,
which
one
expects
to
flash
out
in
a
sudden
,
passionate
glance
,
that
will
dissipate
all
the
quietude
,
like
a
damp
fire
leaping
out
again
when
all
seemed
safe
.
  
<EOS>
But
Maggie
herself
was
not
uneasy
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
She
was
calmly
enjoying
the
free
air
,
while
she
looked
up
at
the
old
fir
-
trees
,
and
thought
that
those
broken
ends
of
branches
were
the
records
of
past
storms
,
which
had
only
made
the
red
stems
soar
higher
.
<EOS>
But
while
her
eyes
were
still
turned
upward
,
she
became
conscious
of
a
moving
shadow
cast
by
the
evening
sun
on
the
grassy
path
before
her
,
and
looked
down
with
a
startled
gesture
to
see
Philip
Wakem
,
who
first
raised
his
hat
,
and
then
,
blushing
deeply
,
came
forward
to
her
and
put
out
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
too
,
colored
with
surprise
,
which
soon
gave
way
to
pleasure
.
<EOS>
She
put
out
her
hand
and
looked
down
at
the
deformed
figure
before
her
with
frank
eyes
,
filled
for
the
moment
with
nothing
but
the
memory
of
her
child
's
feelings
,
 
a
memory
that
was
always
strong
in
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
first
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
startled
me
,
"
she
said
,
smiling
faintly
;
"
I
never
meet
any
one
here
.
<EOS>
How
came
you
to
be
walking
here
?
<EOS>
Did
you
come
to
meet
_
me
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
not
to
perceive
that
Maggie
felt
herself
a
child
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
did
,
"
said
Philip
,
still
embarrassed
;
<EOS>
"
I
wished
to
see
you
very
much
.
<EOS>
I
watched
a
long
while
yesterday
on
the
bank
near
your
house
to
see
if
you
would
come
out
,
but
you
never
came
.
<EOS>
Then
I
watched
again
to
-
day
,
and
when
I
saw
the
way
you
took
,
I
kept
you
in
sight
and
came
down
the
bank
,
behind
there
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
not
be
displeased
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Maggie
,
with
simple
seriousness
,
walking
on
as
if
she
meant
Philip
to
accompany
her
,
"
I
'm
very
glad
you
came
,
for
I
wished
very
much
to
have
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
've
never
forgotten
how
good
you
were
long
ago
to
Tom
,
and
me
too
;
but
I
was
not
sure
that
you
would
remember
us
so
well
.
<EOS>
Tom
and
I
have
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
since
then
,
and
I
think
_
that
_
makes
one
think
more
of
what
happened
before
the
trouble
came
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
believe
that
you
have
thought
of
me
so
much
as
I
have
thought
of
you
,
"
said
Philip
,
timidly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
when
I
was
away
,
I
made
a
picture
of
you
as
you
looked
that
morning
in
the
study
when
you
said
you
would
not
forget
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
drew
a
large
miniature
-
case
from
his
pocket
,
and
opened
it
.
<EOS>
Maggie
saw
her
old
self
leaning
on
a
table
,
with
her
black
locks
hanging
down
behind
her
ears
,
looking
into
space
,
with
strange
,
dreamy
eyes
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
water
-
color
sketch
,
of
real
merit
as
a
portrait
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
"
said
Maggie
,
smiling
,
and
flushed
with
pleasure
,
"
what
a
queer
little
girl
I
was
!
<EOS>
I
remember
myself
with
my
hair
in
that
way
,
in
that
pink
frock
.
<EOS>
I
really
_
was
_
like
a
gypsy
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
am
now
,
"
she
added
,
after
a
little
pause
;
"
am
I
like
what
you
expected
me
to
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
words
might
have
been
those
of
a
coquette
,
but
the
full
,
bright
glance
Maggie
turned
on
Philip
was
not
that
of
a
coquette
.
<EOS>
She
really
did
hope
he
liked
her
face
as
it
was
now
,
but
it
was
simply
the
rising
again
of
her
innate
delight
in
admiration
and
love
.
<EOS>
Philip
met
her
eyes
and
looked
at
her
in
silence
for
a
long
moment
,
before
he
said
quietly
,
"
No
,
Maggie
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
light
died
out
a
little
from
Maggie
's
face
,
and
there
was
a
slight
trembling
of
the
lip
.
<EOS>
Her
eyelids
fell
lower
,
but
she
did
not
turn
away
her
head
,
and
Philip
continued
to
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
Then
he
said
slowly
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
much
more
beautiful
than
I
thought
you
would
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
?
"
<EOS>
said
Maggie
,
the
pleasure
returning
in
a
deeper
flush
.
<EOS>
She
turned
her
face
away
from
him
and
took
some
steps
,
looking
straight
before
her
in
silence
,
as
if
she
were
adjusting
her
consciousness
to
this
new
idea
.
<EOS>
Girls
are
so
accustomed
to
think
of
dress
as
the
main
ground
of
vanity
,
that
,
in
abstaining
from
the
looking
-
glass
,
Maggie
had
thought
more
of
abandoning
all
care
for
adornment
than
of
renouncing
the
contemplation
of
her
face
.
<EOS>
Comparing
herself
with
elegant
,
wealthy
young
ladies
,
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
she
could
produce
any
effect
with
her
person
.
<EOS>
Philip
seemed
to
like
the
silence
well
.
<EOS>
He
walked
by
her
side
,
watching
her
face
,
as
if
that
sight
left
no
room
for
any
other
wish
.
<EOS>
They
had
passed
from
among
the
fir
-
trees
,
and
had
now
come
to
a
green
hollow
almost
surrounded
by
an
amphitheatre
of
the
pale
pink
dog
-
roses
.
<EOS>
But
as
the
light
about
them
had
brightened
,
Maggie
's
face
had
lost
its
glow
.
  
<EOS>
She
stood
still
when
they
were
in
the
hollows
,
and
looking
at
Philip
again
,
she
said
in
a
serious
,
sad
voice
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
we
could
have
been
friends
,
 
I
mean
,
if
it
would
have
been
good
and
right
for
us
.
<EOS>
But
that
is
the
trial
I
have
to
bear
in
everything
;
I
may
not
keep
anything
I
used
to
love
when
I
was
little
.
<EOS>
The
old
books
went
;
and
Tom
is
different
,
and
my
father
.
<EOS>
It
is
like
death
.
<EOS>
I
must
part
with
everything
I
cared
for
when
I
was
a
child
.
<EOS>
And
I
must
part
with
you
;
we
must
never
take
any
notice
of
each
other
again
.
<EOS>
That
was
what
I
wanted
to
speak
to
you
for
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
let
you
know
that
Tom
and
I
ca
n't
do
as
we
like
about
such
things
,
and
that
if
I
behave
as
if
I
had
forgotten
all
about
you
,
it
is
not
out
of
envy
or
pride
 
or
 
or
any
bad
feeling
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
spoke
with
more
and
more
sorrowful
gentleness
as
she
went
on
,
and
her
eyes
began
to
fill
with
tears
.
<EOS>
The
deepening
expression
of
pain
on
Philip
's
face
gave
him
a
stronger
resemblance
to
his
boyish
self
,
and
made
the
deformity
appeal
more
strongly
to
her
pity
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
;
I
see
all
that
you
mean
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
voice
that
had
become
feebler
from
discouragement
;
"
I
know
what
there
is
to
keep
us
apart
on
both
sides
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
right
<EOS>
,
Maggie
,
 
do
n't
you
be
angry
with
me
,
I
am
so
used
to
call
you
Maggie
in
my
thoughts
,
 
it
is
not
right
to
sacrifice
everything
to
other
people
's
unreasonable
feelings
.
<EOS>
I
would
give
up
a
great
deal
for
_
my
_
father
;
but
I
would
not
give
up
a
friendship
or
 
or
an
attachment
of
any
sort
,
in
obedience
to
any
wish
of
his
that
I
did
n't
recognize
as
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Maggie
,
musingly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Often
,
when
I
have
been
angry
and
discontented
,
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
I
was
not
bound
to
give
up
anything
;
and
I
have
gone
on
thinking
till
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
I
could
think
away
all
my
duty
.
<EOS>
But
no
good
has
ever
come
of
that
;
it
was
an
evil
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
I
'm
quite
sure
that
whatever
I
might
do
,
I
should
wish
in
the
end
that
I
had
gone
without
anything
for
myself
,
rather
than
have
made
my
father
's
life
harder
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
would
it
make
his
life
harder
if
we
were
to
see
each
other
sometimes
?
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
He
was
going
to
say
something
else
,
but
checked
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
'm
sure
he
would
n't
like
it
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
ask
me
why
,
or
anything
about
it
,
"
said
Maggie
,
in
a
distressed
tone
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
feels
so
strongly
about
some
things
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
at
all
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
more
am
I
,
"
said
Philip
,
impetuously
;
"
I
am
not
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
said
Maggie
,
gently
.
<EOS>
"
At
least
 
I
ought
not
to
ask
 
<EOS>
but
I
'm
very
,
very
sorry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
turned
to
walk
on
,
as
if
he
had
not
patience
to
stand
still
any
longer
,
and
they
went
out
of
the
hollow
,
winding
amongst
the
trees
and
bushes
in
silence
.
<EOS>
After
that
last
word
of
Philip
's
,
Maggie
could
not
bear
to
insist
immediately
on
their
parting
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
a
great
deal
happier
,
"
she
said
at
last
,
timidly
,
"
since
I
have
given
up
thinking
about
what
is
easy
and
pleasant
,
and
being
discontented
because
I
could
n't
have
my
own
will
.
<EOS>
Our
life
is
determined
for
us
;
and
it
makes
the
mind
very
free
when
we
give
up
wishing
,
and
only
think
of
bearing
what
is
laid
upon
us
,
and
doing
what
is
given
us
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
ca
n't
give
up
wishing
,
"
said
Philip
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
me
we
can
never
give
up
longing
and
wishing
while
we
are
thoroughly
alive
.
<EOS>
There
are
certain
things
we
feel
to
be
beautiful
and
good
,
and
we
_
must
_
hunger
after
them
.
<EOS>
How
can
we
ever
be
satisfied
without
them
until
our
feelings
are
deadened
?
<EOS>
I
delight
in
fine
pictures
;
I
long
to
be
able
to
paint
such
.
<EOS>
I
strive
and
strive
,
and
ca
n't
produce
what
I
want
.
<EOS>
That
is
pain
to
me
,
and
always
_
will
_
be
pain
,
until
my
faculties
lose
their
keenness
,
like
aged
eyes
.
<EOS>
Then
there
are
many
other
things
I
long
for
,
"
 
here
<EOS>
Philip
hesitated
a
little
,
and
then
said
,
 
"
things
that
other
men
have
,
and
that
will
always
be
denied
me
.
<EOS>
My
life
will
have
nothing
great
or
beautiful
in
it
;
I
would
rather
not
have
lived
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Philip
,
"
said
Maggie
,
"
I
wish
you
did
n't
feel
so
.
<EOS>
"
But
her
heart
began
to
beat
with
something
of
Philip
's
discontent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
said
he
,
turning
quickly
round
and
fixing
his
gray
eyes
entreatingly
on
her
face
,
"
I
should
be
contented
to
live
,
if
you
would
let
me
see
you
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
,
checked
by
a
fear
which
her
face
suggested
,
he
looked
away
again
and
said
more
calmly
,
"
I
have
no
friend
to
whom
I
can
tell
everything
,
no
one
who
cares
enough
about
me
;
and
if
I
could
only
see
you
now
and
then
,
and
you
would
let
me
talk
to
you
a
little
,
and
show
me
that
you
cared
for
me
,
and
that
we
may
always
be
friends
in
heart
,
and
help
each
other
,
then
I
might
come
to
be
glad
of
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
how
can
I
see
you
,
Philip
?
"
said
Maggie
,
falteringly
.
<EOS>
(
Could
she
really
do
him
good
?
<EOS>
It
would
be
very
hard
to
say
"
good
-
by
"
this
day
,
and
not
speak
to
him
again
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
new
interest
to
vary
the
days
;
it
was
so
much
easier
to
renounce
the
interest
before
it
came
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
would
let
me
see
you
here
sometimes
,
 
walk
with
you
here
,
 
I
would
be
contented
if
it
were
only
once
or
twice
in
a
month
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
That
_
could
injure
no
one
's
happiness
,
and
it
would
sweeten
my
life
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
"
Philip
went
on
,
with
all
the
inventive
astuteness
of
love
at
one
-
and
-
twenty
,
"
if
there
is
any
enmity
between
those
who
belong
to
us
,
we
ought
all
the
more
to
try
and
quench
it
by
our
friendship
;
I
mean
,
that
by
our
influence
on
both
sides
we
might
bring
about
a
healing
of
the
wounds
that
have
been
made
in
the
past
,
if
I
could
know
everything
about
them
.
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
believe
there
is
any
enmity
in
my
own
father
's
mind
;
I
think
he
has
proved
the
contrary
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
shook
her
head
slowly
,
and
was
silent
,
under
conflicting
thoughts
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
her
inclination
,
that
to
see
Philip
now
and
then
,
and
keep
up
the
bond
of
friendship
with
him
,
was
something
not
only
innocent
,
but
good
;
perhaps
she
might
really
help
him
to
find
contentment
as
she
had
found
it
.
<EOS>
The
voice
that
said
this
made
sweet
music
to
Maggie
;
but
athwart
it
there
came
an
urgent
,
monotonous
warning
from
another
voice
which
she
had
been
learning
to
obey
,
 
the
warning
that
such
interviews
implied
secrecy
;
implied
doing
something
she
would
dread
to
be
discovered
in
,
something
that
,
if
discovered
,
must
cause
anger
and
pain
;
and
that
the
admission
of
anything
so
near
doubleness
would
act
as
a
spiritual
blight
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
music
would
swell
out
again
,
like
chimes
borne
onward
by
a
recurrent
breeze
,
persuading
her
that
the
wrong
lay
all
in
the
faults
and
weaknesses
of
others
,
and
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
futile
sacrifice
for
one
to
the
injury
of
another
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
cruel
for
Philip
that
he
should
be
shrunk
from
,
because
of
an
unjustifiable
vindictiveness
toward
his
father
,
 
poor
Philip
,
whom
some
people
would
shrink
from
only
because
he
was
deformed
.
<EOS>
The
idea
that
he
might
become
her
lover
or
that
her
meeting
him
could
cause
disapproval
in
that
light
,
had
not
occurred
to
her
;
and
Philip
saw
the
absence
of
this
idea
clearly
enough
,
saw
it
with
a
certain
pang
,
although
it
made
her
consent
to
his
request
the
less
unlikely
.
<EOS>
There
was
bitterness
to
him
in
the
perception
that
Maggie
was
almost
as
frank
and
unconstrained
toward
him
as
when
she
was
a
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
either
yes
or
no
,
"
she
said
at
last
,
turning
round
and
walking
toward
the
way
she
come
;
"
I
must
wait
,
lest
I
should
decide
wrongly
.
<EOS>
I
must
seek
for
guidance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
come
again
,
then
,
to
-
morrow
,
or
the
next
day
,
or
next
week
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
had
better
write
,
"
said
Maggie
,
faltering
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
go
to
<EOS>
St.
Ogg
's
sometimes
,
and
I
can
put
the
letter
in
the
post
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
"
said
Philip
eagerly
;
"
that
would
not
be
so
well
.
<EOS>
My
father
might
see
the
letter
 
<EOS>
and
 
he
has
not
any
enmity
,
I
believe
,
but
<EOS>
he
views
things
differently
from
me
;
he
thinks
a
great
deal
about
wealth
and
position
.
<EOS>
Pray
let
me
come
here
once
more
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Tell
_
me
when
it
shall
be
;
or
if
you
ca
n't
tell
me
,
I
will
come
as
often
as
I
can
till
I
do
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
must
be
so
,
then
,
"
said
Maggie
,
"
for
I
ca
n't
be
quite
certain
of
coming
here
any
particular
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
felt
a
great
relief
in
adjourning
the
decision
.
<EOS>
She
was
free
now
to
enjoy
the
minutes
of
companionship
;
she
almost
thought
she
might
linger
a
little
;
the
next
time
they
met
she
should
have
to
pain
Philip
by
telling
him
her
determination
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
help
thinking
,
"
she
said
,
looking
smilingly
at
him
,
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
,
"
how
strange
it
is
that
we
should
have
met
and
talked
to
each
other
,
just
as
if
it
had
been
only
yesterday
when
we
parted
at
Lorton
.
<EOS>
And
yet
we
must
both
be
very
much
altered
in
those
five
years
,
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
five
years
.
<EOS>
How
was
it
<EOS>
you
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
feeling
that
I
was
the
same
Maggie
?
<EOS>
I
was
not
quite
so
sure
that
you
would
be
the
same
;
I
know
you
are
so
clever
,
and
you
must
have
seen
and
learnt
so
much
to
fill
your
mind
;
I
was
not
quite
sure
you
would
care
about
me
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
had
any
doubt
that
you
would
be
the
same
,
<EOS>
whenever
I
migh
see
you
,
"
said
Philip
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
the
same
in
everything
that
made
me
like
you
better
than
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
explain
that
;
I
do
n't
think
any
of
the
strongest
effects
our
natures
are
susceptible
of
can
ever
be
explained
.
<EOS>
We
can
neither
detect
the
process
by
which
they
are
arrived
at
,
nor
the
mode
in
which
they
act
on
us
.
<EOS>
The
greatest
of
painters
only
once
painted
a
mysteriously
divine
child
;
he
could
n't
have
told
how
he
did
it
,
and
we
ca
n't
tell
why
we
feel
it
to
be
divine
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
are
stores
laid
up
in
our
human
nature
that
our
understandings
can
make
no
complete
inventory
of
.
<EOS>
Certain
strains
of
music
affect
me
so
strangely
;
I
can
never
hear
them
without
their
changing
my
whole
attitude
of
mind
for
a
time
,
and
if
the
effect
would
last
,
I
might
be
capable
of
heroisms
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
know
what
you
mean
about
music
;
_
<EOS>
I
_
feel
so
,
"
said
Maggie
,
clasping
her
hands
with
her
old
impetuosity
.
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
"
she
added
,
in
a
saddened
tone
,
"
I
used
to
feel
so
when
I
had
any
music
;
I
never
have
any
now
except
the
organ
at
church
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
long
for
it
,
Maggie
?
"
said
Philip
,
looking
at
her
with
affectionate
pity
.
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
can
have
very
little
that
is
beautiful
in
your
life
.
<EOS>
Have
you
many
books
?
<EOS>
You
were
so
fond
of
them
when
you
were
a
little
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
come
back
to
the
hollow
,
round
which
the
dog
-
roses
grew
,
and
they
both
paused
under
the
charm
of
the
faëry
evening
light
,
reflected
from
the
pale
pink
clusters
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
have
given
up
books
,
"
said
Maggie
,
quietly
,
"
except
a
very
,
very
few
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
had
already
taken
from
his
pocket
a
small
volume
,
and
was
looking
at
the
back
as
he
said
:
  
"
Ah
,
this
is
the
second
volume
,
I
see
,
else
you
might
have
liked
to
take
it
home
with
you

<EOS>
I
put
it
in
my
pocket
because
I
am
studying
a
scene
for
a
picture

"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
had
looked
at
the
back
too
,
and
saw
the
title
;
it
revived
an
old
impression
with
overmastering
force
.

"
"
she
said
,
taking
the
book
from
Philip
's
hands
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
began
that
once
;
I
read
to
where
Minna
is
walking
with
Cleveland
,
and
I
could
never
get
to
read
the
rest
.
<EOS>
I
went
on
with
it
in
my
own
head
,
and
I
made
several
endings
;
but
they
were
all
unhappy
.
<EOS>
I
could
never
make
a
happy
ending
out
of
that
beginning
.
<EOS>
Poor
Minna
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
is
the
real
end
.
<EOS>
For
a
long
while
I
could
n't
get
my
mind
away
from
the
Shetland
Isles
,
 
I
used
to
feel
the
wind
blowing
on
me
from
the
rough
sea
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
spoke
rapidly
,
with
glistening
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
that
volume
home
with
you
,
Maggie
,
"
said
Philip
,
watching
her
with
delight
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
it
now
.
<EOS>
I
shall
make
a
picture
of
you
instead
,
 
you
,
among
the
Scotch
firs
and
the
slanting
shadows
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
had
not
heard
a
word
he
had
said
;
she
was
absorbed
in
a
page
at
which
she
had
opened
.
<EOS>
But
suddenly
she
closed
the
book
,
and
gave
it
back
to
Philip
,
shaking
her
head
with
a
backward
movement
,
as
if
to
say
"
avaunt
"
to
floating
visions
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
keep
it
,
Maggie
,
"
said
Philip
,
entreatingly
;
"
it
will
give
you
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
thank
you
,
"
said
Maggie
,
putting
it
aside
with
her
hand
and
walking
on
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
make
me
in
love
with
this
world
again
,
as
I
used
to
be
;
it
would
make
me
long
to
see
and
know
many
things
;
it
would
make
me
long
for
a
full
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
not
always
be
shut
up
in
your
present
lot
;
why
should
you
starve
your
mind
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
It
is
narrow
asceticism
;
I
do
n't
like
to
see
you
persisting
in
it
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
Poetry
and
art
and
knowledge
are
sacred
and
pure
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
not
for
me
,
not
for
me
,
"
said
Maggie
,
walking
more
hurriedly
;
"
because
I
should
want
too
much
.
<EOS>
I
must
wait
;
this
life
will
not
last
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
hurry
away
from
me
without
saying
"
good
-
by
,
"
Maggie
,
"
said
Philip
,
as
they
reached
the
group
of
Scotch
firs
,
and
she
continued
still
to
walk
along
without
speaking
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
go
any
farther
,
I
think
,
must
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
I
forgot
;
<EOS>
good
-
by
,
"
said
Maggie
,
pausing
,
and
putting
out
her
hand
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
action
brought
her
feeling
back
in
a
strong
current
to
Philip
;
and
after
they
had
stood
looking
at
each
other
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
,
with
their
hands
clasped
,
she
said
,
withdrawing
her
hand
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
grateful
to
you
for
thinking
of
me
all
those
years
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
sweet
to
have
people
love
us
.
<EOS>
What
a
wonderful
,
beautiful
thing
it
seems
that
God
should
have
made
your
heart
so
that
you
could
care
about
a
queer
little
girl
whom
you
only
knew
for
a
few
weeks
!
<EOS>
I
remember
saying
to
you
that
I
thought
you
cared
for
me
more
than
Tom
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Maggie
,
"
said
Philip
,
almost
fretfully
,
"
you
would
never
love
me
so
well
as
you
love
your
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
,
"
said
Maggie
,
simply
;
"
but
then
,
you
know
,
the
first
thing
I
ever
remember
in
my
life
is
standing
with
Tom
by
the
side
of
the
Floss
,
while
he
held
my
hand
;
everything
before
that
is
dark
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
never
forget
you
,
though
we
must
keep
apart
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
say
so
,
Maggie
,
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
kept
that
little
girl
in
my
mind
for
five
years
,
did
n't
I
earn
some
part
in
her
?
<EOS>
She
ought
not
to
take
herself
quite
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
if
I
were
free
,
"
said
Maggie
;
"
but
I
am
not
,
I
must
submit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
then
added
,
"
<EOS>
And
I
wanted
to
say
to
you
,
that
you
had
better
not
take
more
notice
of
my
brother
than
just
bowing
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
once
told
me
not
to
speak
to
you
again
,
and
he
does
n't
change
his
mind
 
<EOS>
Oh
dear
,
the
sun
is
set
.
<EOS>
I
am
too
long
away
.
<EOS>
Good
-
by
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
gave
him
her
hand
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
come
here
as
often
as
I
can
till
I
see
you
again
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
Have
some
feeling
for
_
me
<EOS>
_
as
well
as
for
others
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
I
have
,
"
said
Maggie
,
hurrying
away
,
and
quickly
disappearing
behind
the
last
fir
-
tree
;
<EOS>
though
Philip
's
gaze
after
her
remained
immovable
for
minutes
as
if
he
saw
her
still
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
went
home
,
with
an
inward
conflict
already
begun
;
Philip
went
home
to
do
nothing
but
remember
and
hope
.
<EOS>
You
can
hardly
help
blaming
him
severely
.
<EOS>
He
was
four
or
five
years
older
than
Maggie
,
and
had
a
full
consciousness
of
his
feeling
toward
her
to
aid
him
in
foreseeing
the
character
his
contemplated
interviews
with
her
would
bear
in
the
opinion
of
a
third
person
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
not
suppose
that
he
was
capable
of
a
gross
selfishness
,
or
that
he
could
have
been
satisfied
without
persuading
himself
that
he
was
seeking
to
infuse
some
happiness
into
Maggie
's
life
,
 
seeking
this
even
more
than
any
direct
ends
for
himself
.
<EOS>
He
could
give
her
sympathy
;
he
could
give
her
help
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
the
slightest
promise
of
love
toward
him
in
her
manner
;
it
was
nothing
more
than
the
sweet
girlish
tenderness
she
had
shown
him
when
she
was
twelve
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
would
never
love
him
;
perhaps
no
woman
ever
_
<EOS>
could
_
love
him
.
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
he
would
endure
that
;
he
should
at
least
have
the
happiness
of
seeing
her
,
of
feeling
some
nearness
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
he
clutched
passionately
the
possibility
that
she
_
might
_
love
him
;
perhaps
the
feeling
would
grow
,
if
she
could
come
to
associate
him
with
that
watchful
tenderness
which
her
nature
would
be
so
keenly
alive
to
.
<EOS>
If
any
woman
could
love
him
,
surely
Maggie
was
that
woman
;
there
was
such
wealth
of
love
in
her
,
and
there
was
no
one
to
claim
it
all
.
<EOS>
Then
,
the
pity
of
it
,
that
a
mind
like
hers
should
be
withering
in
its
very
youth
,
like
a
young
forest
-
tree
,
for
want
of
the
light
and
space
it
was
formed
to
flourish
in
!
<EOS>
Could
he
not
hinder
that
,
by
persuading
her
out
of
her
system
of
privation
?
<EOS>
He
would
be
her
guardian
angel
;
he
would
do
anything
,
bear
anything
,
for
her
sake
 
except
not
seeing
her
.

Aunt
Glegg
Learns
the
Breadth

Bob

<EOS>
While
Maggie
's
life
-
struggles
had
lain
almost
entirely
within
her
own
soul
,
one
shadowy
army
fighting
another
,
and
the
slain
shadows
forever
rising
again
<EOS>
,
Tom
was
engaged
in
a
dustier
,
noisier
warfare
,
grappling
with
more
substantial
obstacles
,
and
gaining
more
definite
conquests
.
<EOS>
So
it
has
been
since
the
days
of
Hecuba
,
and
of
Hector
,
Tamer
of
horses
;
inside
the
gates
,
the
women
with
streaming
hair
and
uplifted
hands
offering
prayers
,
watching
the
world
's
combat
from
afar
,
filling
their
long
,
empty
days
with
memories
and
fears
;
outside
,
the
men
,
in
fierce
struggle
with
things
divine
and
human
,
quenching
memory
in
the
stronger
light
of
purpose
,
losing
the
sense
of
dread
and
even
of
wounds
in
the
hurrying
ardor
of
action
.
  
<EOS>
From
what
you
have
seen
of
Tom
,
I
think
he
is
not
a
youth
of
whom
you
would
prophesy
failure
in
anything
he
had
thoroughly
wished
;
the
wagers
are
likely
to
be
on
his
side
,
notwithstanding
his
small
success
in
the
classics
.
<EOS>
For
Tom
had
never
desired
success
in
this
field
of
enterprise
;
and
for
getting
a
fine
flourishing
growth
of
stupidity
there
is
nothing
like
pouring
out
on
a
mind
a
good
amount
of
subjects
in
which
it
feels
no
interest
.
<EOS>
But
now
Tom
's
strong
will
bound
together
his
integrity
,
his
pride
,
his
family
regrets
,
and
his
personal
ambition
,
and
made
them
one
force
,
concentrating
his
efforts
and
surmounting
discouragements
.
<EOS>
His
uncle
Deane
,
who
watched
him
closely
,
soon
began
to
conceive
hopes
of
him
,
and
to
be
rather
proud
that
he
had
brought
into
the
employment
of
the
firm
a
nephew
who
appeared
to
be
made
of
such
good
commercial
stuff
.
<EOS>
The
real
kindness
of
placing
him
in
the
warehouse
first
was
soon
evident
to
Tom
,
in
the
hints
his
uncle
began
to
throw
out
,
that
after
a
time
he
might
perhaps
be
trusted
to
travel
at
certain
seasons
,
and
buy
in
for
the
firm
various
vulgar
commodities
with
which
I
need
not
shock
refined
ears
in
this
place
;
and
it
was
doubtless
with
a
view
to
this
result
that
Mr.
Deane
,
when
he
expected
to
take
his
wine
alone
,
would
tell
Tom
to
step
in
and
sit
with
him
an
hour
,
and
would
pass
that
hour
in
much
lecturing
and
catechising
concerning
articles
of
export
and
import
,
with
an
occasional
excursus
of
more
indirect
utility
on
the
relative
advantages
to
the
merchants
of
St.
Ogg
's
of
having
goods
brought
in
their
own
and
in
foreign
bottoms
,
 
a
subject
on
which
Mr.
Deane
,
as
a
ship
-
owner
,
naturally
threw
off
a
few
sparks
when
he
got
warmed
with
talk
and
wine
.
  
<EOS>
Already
,
in
the
second
year
,
Tom
's
salary
was
raised
;
but
all
,
except
the
price
of
his
dinner
and
clothes
,
went
home
into
the
tin
box
;
and
he
shunned
comradeship
,
lest
it
should
lead
him
into
expenses
in
spite
of
himself
.
<EOS>
Not
that
Tom
was
moulded
on
the
spoony
type
of
the
Industrious
Apprentice
;
he
had
a
very
strong
appetite
for
pleasure
,
 
would
have
liked
to
be
a
Tamer
of
horses
and
to
make
a
distinguished
figure
in
all
neighboring
eyes
,
dispensing
treats
and
benefits
to
others
with
well
-
judged
liberality
,
and
being
pronounced
one
of
the
finest
young
fellows
of
those
parts
;
nay
,
he
determined
to
achieve
these
things
sooner
or
later
;
but
his
practical
shrewdness
told
him
that
the
means
no
such
achievements
could
only
lie
for
him
in
present
abstinence
and
self
-
denial
;
there
were
certain
milestones
to
be
passed
,
and
one
of
the
first
was
the
payment
of
his
father
's
debts
.
<EOS>
Having
made
up
his
mind
on
that
point
,
he
strode
along
without
swerving
,
contracting
some
rather
saturnine
sternness
,
as
a
young
man
is
likely
to
do
who
has
a
premature
call
upon
him
for
self
-
reliance
.
<EOS>
Tom
felt
intensely
that
common
cause
with
his
father
which
springs
from
family
pride
,
and
was
bent
on
being
irreproachable
as
a
son
;
but
his
growing
experience
caused
him
to
pass
much
silent
criticism
on
the
rashness
and
imprudence
of
his
father
's
past
conduct
;
their
dispositions
were
not
in
sympathy
,
and
Tom
's
face
showed
little
radiance
during
his
few
home
hours
.
<EOS>
Maggie
had
an
awe
of
him
,
against
which
she
struggled
as
something
unfair
to
her
consciousness
of
wider
thoughts
and
deeper
motives
;
but
it
was
of
no
use
to
struggle
.
<EOS>
A
character
at
unity
with
itself
 
<EOS>
that
performs
what
it
intends
,
subdues
every
counteracting
impulse
,
and
has
no
visions
beyond
the
distinctly
possible
 
<EOS>
is
strong
by
its
very
negations
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
imagine
that
Tom
's
more
and
more
obvious
unlikeness
to
his
father
was
well
fitted
to
conciliate
the
maternal
aunts
and
uncles
;
and
Mr.
Deane
's
favorable
reports
and
predictions
to
Mr.
Glegg
concerning
Tom
's
qualifications
for
business
began
to
be
discussed
amongst
them
with
various
acceptance
.
<EOS>
He
was
likely
,
it
appeared
,
to
do
the
family
credit
without
causing
it
any
expense
and
trouble
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pullet
had
always
thought
it
strange
if
Tom
's
excellent
complexion
,
so
entirely
that
of
the
Dodsons
,
did
not
argue
a
certainty
that
he
would
turn
out
well
;
his
juvenile
errors
of
running
down
the
peacock
,
and
general
disrespect
to
his
aunts
,
only
indicating
a
tinge
of
Tulliver
blood
which
he
had
doubtless
outgrown
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
,
who
had
contracted
a
cautious
liking
for
Tom
ever
since
his
spirited
and
sensible
behavior
when
the
execution
was
in
the
house
,
was
now
warming
into
a
resolution
to
further
his
prospects
actively
,
 
some
time
,
when
an
opportunity
offered
of
doing
so
in
a
prudent
manner
,
without
ultimate
loss
;
but
Mrs.
Glegg
observed
that
she
was
not
given
to
speak
without
book
,
as
some
people
were
;
that
those
who
said
least
were
most
likely
to
find
their
words
made
good
;
and
that
when
the
right
moment
came
,
it
would
be
seen
who
could
do
something
better
than
talk
.
<EOS>
Uncle
Pullet
,
after
silent
meditation
for
a
period
of
several
lozenges
,
came
distinctly
to
the
conclusion
,
that
when
a
young
man
was
likely
to
do
well
,
it
was
better
not
to
meddle
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
,
meanwhile
,
had
shown
no
disposition
to
rely
on
any
one
but
himself
,
though
,
with
a
natural
sensitiveness
toward
all
indications
of
favorable
opinion
,
he
was
glad
to
see
his
uncle
<EOS>
Glegg
look
in
on
him
sometimes
in
a
friendly
way
during
business
hours
,
and
glad
to
be
invited
to
dine
at
his
house
,
though
he
usually
preferred
declining
on
the
ground
that
he
was
not
sure
of
being
punctual
.
<EOS>
But
about
a
year
ago
,
something
had
occurred
which
induced
Tom
to
test
his
uncle
Glegg
's
friendly
disposition
.
  
<EOS>
Bob
Jakin
,
who
rarely
returned
from
one
of
his
rounds
without
seeing
Tom
and
Maggie
,
awaited
him
on
the
bridge
as
he
was
coming
home
from
St.
Ogg
's
one
evening
,
that
they
might
have
a
little
private
talk
.
<EOS>
He
took
the
liberty
of
asking
if
Mr.
Tom
had
ever
thought
of
making
money
by
trading
a
bit
on
his
own
account
.
<EOS>
Trading
,
how
?
<EOS>
Tom
wished
to
know
.
<EOS>
Why
,
by
sending
out
a
bit
of
a
cargo
to
foreign
ports
;
because
Bob
had
a
particular
friend
who
had
offered
to
do
a
little
business
for
him
in
that
way
in
Laceham
goods
,
and
would
be
glad
to
serve
Mr.
Tom
on
the
same
footing
.
<EOS>
Tom
was
interested
at
once
,
and
begged
for
full
explanation
,
wondering
he
had
not
thought
of
this
plan
before
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
so
well
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
a
speculation
that
might
change
the
slow
process
of
addition
into
multiplication
,
that
he
at
once
determined
to
mention
the
matter
to
his
father
,
and
get
his
consent
to
appropriate
some
of
the
savings
in
the
tin
box
to
the
purchase
of
a
small
cargo
.
<EOS>
He
would
rather
not
have
consulted
his
father
,
but
he
had
just
paid
his
last
quarter
's
money
into
the
tin
box
,
and
there
was
no
other
resource
.
<EOS>
All
the
savings
were
there
;
for
Mr.
Tulliver
would
not
consent
to
put
the
money
out
at
interest
lest
he
should
lose
it
.
<EOS>
Since
he
had
speculated
in
the
purchase
of
some
corn
,
and
had
lost
by
it
,
he
could
not
be
easy
without
keeping
the
money
under
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
approached
the
subject
carefully
,
as
he
was
seated
on
the
hearth
with
his
father
that
evening
,
and
Mr.
Tulliver
listened
,
leaning
forward
in
his
arm
-
chair
and
looking
up
in
Tom
's
face
with
a
sceptical
glance
.
<EOS>
His
first
impulse
was
to
give
a
positive
refusal
,
but
he
was
in
some
awe
of
Tom
's
wishes
,
and
since
he
had
the
sense
of
being
an
"
unlucky
"
father
,
he
had
lost
some
of
his
old
peremptoriness
and
determination
to
be
master
.
<EOS>
He
took
the
key
of
the
bureau
from
his
pocket
,
got
out
the
key
of
the
large
chest
,
and
fetched
down
the
tin
box
,
 
slowly
,
as
if
he
were
trying
to
defer
the
moment
of
a
painful
parting
.
<EOS>
Then
he
seated
himself
against
the
table
,
and
opened
the
box
with
that
little
padlock
-
key
which
he
fingered
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
in
all
vacant
moments
.
<EOS>
There
they
were
,
the
dingy
bank
-
notes
and
the
bright
sovereigns
,
and
he
counted
them
out
on
the
table
 
only
a
hundred
and
sixteen
pounds
in
two
years
,
after
all
the
pinching
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
much
do
you
want
,
then
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
speaking
as
if
the
words
burnt
his
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
I
begin
with
the
thirty
-
six
pounds
,
father
?
"
said
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
separated
this
sum
from
the
rest
,
and
keeping
his
hand
over
it
,
said
:
  
"
It
's
as
much
as
I
can
save
out
o
<EOS>
'
my
pay
in
a
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
father
;
it
is
such
slow
work
,
saving
out
of
the
little
money
we
get
.
<EOS>
And
in
this
way
we
might
double
our
savings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
my
lad
,
"
said
the
father
,
keeping
his
hand
on
the
money
,
"
but
you
might
lose
it
,
 
you
might
lose
a
year
o
'
<EOS>
my
life
,
 
and
I
have
n't
got
many
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
was
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
know
I
would
n't
pay
a
dividend
with
the
first
hundred
,
because
I
wanted
to
see
it
all
in
a
lump
,
 
and
when
I
see
it
,
I
'm
sure
on't
.
<EOS>
If
you
trust
to
luck
,
it
's
sure
to
be
against
me
.
<EOS>
It
's
Old
Harry
's
got
the
luck
in
his
hands
;
and
if
I
lose
one
year
,
I
shall
never
pick
it
up
again
;
<EOS>
death
"
ull
<EOS>
o'ertake
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
's
voice
trembled
,
and
Tom
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
before
he
said
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
give
it
up
,
father
,
since
you
object
to
it
so
strongly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
unwilling
to
abandon
the
scheme
altogether
,
he
determined
to
ask
his
uncle
Glegg
to
venture
twenty
pounds
,
on
condition
of
receiving
five
per
cent
.
<EOS>
of
the
profits
.
<EOS>
That
was
really
a
very
small
thing
to
ask
.
<EOS>
So
when
Bob
called
the
next
day
at
the
wharf
to
know
the
decision
,
Tom
proposed
that
they
should
go
together
to
his
uncle
Glegg
's
to
open
the
business
;
for
his
diffident
pride
clung
to
him
,
and
made
him
feel
that
Bobs
'
tongue
would
relieve
him
from
some
embarrassment
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
,
at
the
pleasant
hour
of
four
in
the
afternoon
of
a
hot
August
day
,
was
naturally
counting
his
wall
-
fruit
to
assure
himself
that
the
sum
total
had
not
varied
since
yesterday
.
<EOS>
To
him
entered
Tom
,
in
what
appeared
to
Mr.
Glegg
very
questionable
companionship
,
 
that
of
a
man
with
a
pack
on
his
back
,
 
for
Bob
was
equipped
for
a
new
journey
,
 
and
of
a
huge
brindled
bull
-
terrier
,
who
walked
with
a
slow
,
swaying
movement
from
side
to
side
,
and
glanced
from
under
his
eye
-
lids
with
a
surly
indifference
which
might
after
all
be
a
cover
to
the
most
offensive
designs
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
's
spectacles
,
which
had
been
assisting
him
in
counting
the
fruit
,
made
these
suspicious
details
alarmingly
evident
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Heigh
!
<EOS>
heigh
!
<EOS>
keep
that
dog
back
,
will
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
shouted
,
snatching
up
a
stake
and
holding
it
before
him
as
a
shield
when
the
visitors
were
within
three
yards
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Get
out
wi
'
you
,
Mumps
,
"
said
Bob
,
with
a
kick
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
,
sir
,
"
 
an
observation
which
Mumps
corroborated
by
a
low
growl
as
he
retreated
behind
his
master
's
legs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
ever
does
this
mean
,
Tom
?
"
said
Mr.
Glegg
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
brought
information
about
the
scoundrels
as
cut
my
trees
?
<EOS>
"
If
Bob
came
in
the
character
of
"
information
,
"
Mr.
Glegg
saw
reasons
for
tolerating
some
irregularity
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
said
Tom
;
"
I
came
to
speak
to
you
about
a
little
matter
of
business
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
 
well
;
but
what
has
this
dog
got
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
getting
mild
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
dog
,
sir
,
"
said
the
ready
Bob
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
'
it
's
me
as
put
Mr.
Tom
up
to
the
bit
<EOS>
o
'
business
;
for
Mr.
Tom
's
been
a
friend
o
'
mine
iver
since
I
was
a
little
chap

fust
thing
iver
I

An

turns
up

I

if
I

Tom
have

<EOS>
An

<EOS>
it
's
a
downright
roarin

shame
,
as
when
he
's
got
the
chance

making

sending

ten

An

I

<EOS>
Uncle
Glegg
stood
open
-
mouthed
with
astonishment
at
this
unembarrassed
loquacity
,
with
which
his
understanding
could
hardly
keep
pace
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
Bob
,
first
over
his
spectacles
,
then
through
them
,
then
over
them
again
;
while
Tom
,
doubtful
of
his
uncle
's
impression
,
began
to
wish
he
had
not
brought
this
singular
Aaron
,
or
mouthpiece
.
<EOS>
Bob
's
talk
appeared
less
seemly
,
now
some
one
besides
himself
was
listening
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
be
a
knowing
fellow
,
"
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
sir
,
you
say
true
,
"
returned
Bob
,
nodding
his
head
aside
;
"
I
think
my
head
's
all
alive
inside
like
an
old
cheese
,
for
I
'm
so
full
o
'
plans
,
one
knocks
another
over
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
n't
Mumps
to
talk
to
,
I
should
get
top
-
heavy
an
'
tumble
in
a
fit
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
's
because
I
niver
went
to
school
much
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
jaw
my
old
mother
for
.
<EOS>
I
says
,
"
You
should
ha
'
sent
me
to
school
a
bit
more

I
says
,
"
an

I

<EOS>
Lors

she

fine

comfor'ble

my
old
mother
is

she
ates
her
baked
meat

taters
as
often

<EOS>
For
I

gettin

so
full

I
must
hev

<EOS>
But
it
's
botherin

"
a
wife

and
Mumps
might
n't

"
  
<EOS>
Uncle
Glegg
,
who
regarded
himself
as
a
jocose
man
since
he
had
retired
from
business
,
was
beginning
to
find
Bob
amusing
,
but
he
had
still
a
disapproving
observation
to
make
,
which
kept
his
face
serious
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
should
think
you
're
at

loss
for
ways

else
you

much

It

shameful
 
shameful

"
<EOS>
But
he
spoke
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
,
and
quickly
added
:
  
"
<EOS>
But
,
come
now
,
let
's
hear
more
about
this
business
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
want
a
little
sum
to
make
a
venture
with
.
<EOS>
But
where
's
all
your
own
money
?
<EOS>
You
do
n't
spend
it
all
 
eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
sir
,
"
said
Tom
,
coloring
;
"
but
my
father
is
unwilling
to
risk
it
,
and
I
do
n't
like
to
press
him
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
get
twenty
or
thirty
pounds
to
begin
with
,
I
could
pay
five
per
cent
for
it
,
and
then
I
could
gradually
make
a
little
capital
of
my
own
,
and
do
without
a
loan
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
 
ay
,
"
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
in
an
approving
tone
;
"
that
's
not
a
bad
notion
,
and
I
wo
n't
say
as
I
would
n't
be
your
man

<EOS>
But
it
"
ull
be
as
well
for
me
to
see
this
Salt
,
as
you
talk
on

<EOS>
And
then
 
here
's
this
friend
<EOS>
o
'
yours
offers
to
buy
the
goods
for
you

<EOS>
Perhaps
you
've
got
somebody
to
stand
surety
for
you
if
the
money
's
put
into
your
hands
?
<EOS>
"
added
the
cautious
old
gentleman
,
looking
over
his
spectacles
at
Bob
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
that
's
necessary

uncle

"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
least
,
I
mean
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
me
,
because
I
know
Bob
well
;
but
perhaps
it
would
be
right
for
you
to
have
some
security
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
get
your
percentage
out
<EOS>
o

<EOS>
the
purchase

I
suppose
?
"
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
looking
at
Bob
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
said
Bob
,
rather
indignantly
;
"
I
did
n't
offer
to
get
a
apple
for
Mr.
Tom
,
o
'
purpose
to
hev
a
bite
out
of
it
myself

<EOS>
When
I
play

tricks

there
'll
be
more
fun

that

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
it
's
nothing
<EOS>
but
right
you
should
have
a
small
percentage
,

said
Mr.
Glegg
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
no
opinion

transactions

folks
do
things

It
allays
looks
bad

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
said
Bob
,
whose
keenness
saw
at
once
what
was
implied
,
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
get
by't

said
a
severe
voice
from
the
open
parlor
window
,
"
pray
are
you
coming
in

are
you

Murdered

said
Mr.

;
"
what

the

Here

<EOS>
"
Murdered
,
 
yes
<EOS>
,
 
it
is
n't
many

sizes
ago
since
a
packman
murdered
a
young
woman
in
a
lone
place
,
and
stole
her
thimble
,
and
threw
her
body
into
a
ditch
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
nay
,
"
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
soothingly
,
"
you

thinking

the
man

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well

it

the

Mr.

only
you

contradicting
what
I
say

if

about
business

it

be
more
fitting
if
you
'd
bring
him
into
the
house

and
let
his
aunt
know
about
it
,
<EOS>
instead
o

in

underminding

<EOS>
"
Well

said
Mr.

,
"
we
'll
come

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You

said
the
lady
to
Bob
,
in
a
loud
voice
,
adapted
to
the
moral
,
not
the
physical
,
distance
between
them
.
<EOS>
"
We
do
n't

anything

I

Mind

you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
bit
;
not
so
fast
,
"
said
Mr.
Glegg
;
"
I
have
n't
done
with
this
young
man

<EOS>
Come
in

Tom

come

"
he
added
,
stepping
in
at
the
French
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Glegg
,
"
said
Mrs.
G.
,
in
a
fatal
tone
,
"
if
you
're
going
to
let
that
man

his
dog

my
carpet

so
good

<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
you
be
uneasy
,
mum
,
"
said
Bob
,
touching
his
cap
.
<EOS>
He
saw
at
once
that
Mrs.
Glegg
was
a
bit
of
game
worth
running
down
,
and
longed
to
be
at
the
sport
;
"
we
'll
stay
out

upo

the

Mumps

<EOS>
Mumps
knows

I
might
hish
at

before
he
'd
fly

It

wonderful
how
he
knows

is
the
good

looking

fond
of
'em

good

<EOS>
Lors

"
<EOS>
added
Bob
,
laying
down
his
pack
on
the
gravel
<EOS>
,
"
it
's
a
thousand
pities
<EOS>
such
a
lady
as
you
should
n't
deal
with

,
i

into

there

up

an
'
all

to
get
their

out
of
a

o

calico

it

's
to
reason
you
must
pay
three
times
the

you
pay

is
the

"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
reckon
I
can
,
and
through
the
packmen
too

"
observed
Mrs.
Glegg
,
intending
to
imply
that
Bob
's
flattery
had
produced
no
effect
on
_
her
;
_
while
her
husband
,
standing
behind
her
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
legs
apart
,
winked
and
smiled
with
conjugal
delight
at
the
probability
of
his
wife

being
circumvented
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay

to

"
said
Bob
.
<EOS>

Why

"
<EOS>
Ah

said
Mrs.

pouring
out
the
tea
.
<EOS>
"
You

Are
you

evasively

you

the
bundle
emphatically
with
his

said
Mrs.

with
a
triumphant
sense
of
her
insurmountable
sagacity

said
Mrs.

who
,
solicited
by
a
double
curiosity
,
was
obliged
to
let
the
one
-
half
wait

<EOS>
"
A

said
good

natured
Mr.

Jane

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
hope
it
is
n't
a
plan
where
he
expects
iverything
to
be
done
for

that
's
what
the

think

what
goes

Ca

<EOS>
"
This
is
Bob
Jakin

aunt

said
Tom
,
bridling
the
irritation
that
aunt
Glegg
's
voice
always
produced
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
known

<EOS>
He
's
a
very
good
fellow

always
ready

do

a
kindness

And
he
has
had
some
experience
in
sending
goods
out
,
 
a
small
part
of
a
cargo
as
a
private
speculation
;
and
he
thinks
if
I
could
begin
to
do
a
little
in
the

way

I
might
make
some
money

<EOS>
A

<EOS>

Large

with
eagerness

what
do
you
call
large
int'rest

<EOS>
Ten

twelve

Bob
says
,
after
expenses

<EOS>

Then
why
was

such

said
Mrs.

turning
to
her
husband

with
a
deep
grating
tone
of
reproach
.
<EOS>
"
Have
n't
you
allays
told
me
as
there
was
no
getting
more
nor
five

"
Pooh

pooh

nonsense

my

said
Mr.

<EOS>
"
You
could

You
ca

I
can
turn

Mr.

"
Very
well

rather
snappishly

'll

Bob
went
on

becoming
rapid
again
,
and
holding
up
a
scarlet
woollen

an
embroidered

in

Bob
held
it
at

distance
for
admiration

Mrs.

said
sharply
:

added
Bob
,
flinging
it
behind
him
on
to
the

as

holding
forth
the

half

yard

Mrs.

was
busy
examining
the
damaged

throwing
her
head

wrapping
the

up

the

apparently
about

fasten
up

<EOS>

said
the

,
<EOS>
as
her
husband
took
his

,
"

<EOS>
"
Well

said
Mr.

hastily

<EOS>

Well

Tom

concluded
Mrs.
Glegg
,
turning
impressively
to
her
nephew
,
"
I
hope
you
'll
allays
bear
it
in
mind
and
be
grateful
for
such
an
aunt

<EOS>
I
mean

you

I
do

we
niver

my

family

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
aunt
,
"
said
Tom
,
rather
proudly
.
<EOS>
"
I
prefer
having
the
money
only
lent
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
;
that
's
the
Dodson
sperrit
,
"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
rising
to
get
her
knitting
with
the
sense
that
any
further
remark
after
this
would
be
bathos
.
  
<EOS>
Salt
 
that
eminently
"
briny
chap
"
 
having
been
discovered
in
a
cloud
of
tobacco
-
smoke
at
the
Anchor
Tavern
,
Mr.
Glegg
commenced
inquiries
which
turned
out
satisfactorily
enough
to
warrant
the
advance
of
the
"
nest
-
egg
,
"
to
which
aunt
Glegg
contributed
twenty
pounds
;
and
in
this
modest
beginning
you
see
the
ground
of
a
fact
which
might
otherwise
surprise
you
;
namely
,
Tom
's
accumulation
of
a
fund
,
unknown
to
his
father
,
that
promised
in
no
very
long
time
to
meet
the
more
tardy
process
of
saving
,
and
quite
cover
the
deficit
.
<EOS>
When
once
his
attention
had
been
turned
to
this
source
of
gain
,
Tom
determined
to
make
the
most
of
it
,
and
lost
on
opportunity
of
obtaining
information
and
extending
his
small
enterprises
.
<EOS>
In
not
telling
his
father
,
he
was
influenced
by
that
strange
mixture
of
opposite
feelings
which
often
gives
equal
truth
to
those
who
blame
an
action
and
those
who
admire
it
,
 
partly
,
it
was
that
disinclination
to
confidence
which
is
seen
between
near
kindred
,
that
family
repulsion
which
spoils
the
most
sacred
relations
of
our
lives
;
partly
,
it
was
the
desire
to
surprise
his
father
with
a
great
joy
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
see
that
it
would
have
been
better
to
soothe
the
interval
with
a
new
hope
,
and
prevent
the
delirium
of
a
too
sudden
elation
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
time
of
Maggie
's
first
meeting
with
Philip
,
Tom
had
already
nearly
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
of
his
own
capital
;
and
while
they
were
walking
by
the
evening
light
in
the
Red
Deeps
,
he
,
by
the
same
evening
light
,
was
riding
into
Laceham
,
proud
of
being
on
his
first
journey
on
behalf
of
Guest
&
Co.
,
and
revolving
in
his
mind
all
the
chances
that
by
the
end
of
another
year
he
should
have
doubled
his
gains
,
lifted
off
the
obloquy
of
debt
from
his
father
's
name
,
and
perhaps
 
for
he
should
be
twenty
-
one
 
have
got
a
new
start
for
himself
,
on
a
higher
platform
of
employment
.
<EOS>
Did
he
not
desire
it
?
<EOS>
He
was
quite
sure
that
he
did
.
    
<EOS>
The
Wavering
Balance
  
<EOS>
I
said
that
Maggie
went
home
that
evening
from
the
Red
Deeps
with
a
mental
conflict
already
begun
.
<EOS>
You
have
seen
clearly
enough
,
in
her
interview
with
Philip
,
what
that
conflict
was
.
<EOS>
Here
suddenly
was
an
opening
in
the
rocky
wall
which
shut
in
the
narrow
valley
of
humiliation
,
where
all
her
prospect
was
the
remote
,
unfathomed
sky
;
and
some
of
the
memory
-
haunting
earthly
delights
were
no
longer
out
of
her
reach
.
<EOS>
She
might
have
books
,
converse
,
affection
;
she
might
hear
tidings
of
the
world
from
which
her
mind
had
not
yet
lost
its
sense
of
exile
;
and
it
would
be
a
kindness
to
Philip
too
,
who
was
pitiable
,
 
clearly
not
happy
.
<EOS>
And
perhaps
here
was
an
opportunity
indicated
for
making
her
mind
more
worthy
of
its
highest
service
;
perhaps
the
noblest
,
completest
devoutness
could
hardly
exist
without
some
width
of
knowledge
;
_
must
_
she
always
live
in
this
resigned
imprisonment
?
<EOS>
It
was
so
blameless
,
<EOS>
so
good
a
thing
that
there
should
be
friendship
between
her
and
Philip
;
the
motives
that
forbade
it
were
so
unreasonable
,
so
unchristian
!
<EOS>
But
the
severe
monotonous
warning
came
again
and
again
,
 
that
she
was
losing
the
simplicity
and
clearness
of
her
life
by
admitting
a
ground
of
concealment
;
and
that
,
by
forsaking
the
simple
rule
of
renunciation
,
she
was
throwing
herself
under
the
seductive
guidance
of
illimitable
wants
.
<EOS>
She
thought
she
had
won
strength
to
obey
the
warning
before
she
allowed
herself
the
next
week
to
turn
her
steps
in
the
evening
to
the
Red
Deeps
.
<EOS>
But
while
she
was
resolved
to
say
an
affectionate
farewell
to
Philip
,
how
she
looked
forward
to
that
evening
walk
in
the
still
,
fleckered
shade
of
the
hollows
,
away
from
all
that
was
harsh
and
unlovely
;
to
the
affectionate
,
admiring
looks
that
would
meet
her
;
to
the
sense
of
comradeship
that
childish
memories
would
give
to
wiser
,
older
talk
;
to
the
certainty
that
Philip
would
care
to
hear
everything
she
said
,
which
no
one
else
cared
for
!
<EOS>
It
was
a
half
-
hour
that
it
would
be
very
hard
to
turn
her
back
upon
,
with
the
sense
that
there
would
be
no
other
like
it
.
<EOS>
Yet
she
said
what
she
meant
to
say
;
she
looked
firm
as
well
as
sad
.
  
<EOS>
"
Philip
,
I
have
made
up
my
mind
;
it
is
right
that
we
should
give
each
other
up
,
in
everything
but
memory
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
you
without
concealment
 
<EOS>
stay
<EOS>
,
I
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
,
 
it
is
other
people
's
wrong
feelings
that
make
concealment
necessary
;
but
concealment
is
bad
,
however
it
may
be
caused
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
it
would
be
bad
for
me
,
for
us
both
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
if
our
secret
were
discovered
,
there
would
be
nothing
but
misery
,
 
dreadful
anger
;
and
then
we
must
part
after
all
,
and
it
would
be
harder
,
when
we
were
used
to
seeing
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
face
had
flushed
,
and
there
was
a
momentary
eagerness
of
expression
,
as
if
he
had
been
about
to
resist
this
decision
with
all
his
might
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
controlled
himself
,
and
said
,
with
assumed
calmness
:
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Maggie
,
if
we
must
part
,
let
us
try
and
forget
it
for
one
half
hour
;
let
us
talk
together
a
little
while
,
for
the
last
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
her
hand
,
and
Maggie
felt
no
reason
to
withdraw
it
;
his
quietness
made
her
all
the
more
sure
she
had
given
him
great
pain
,
and
she
wanted
to
show
him
how
unwillingly
she
had
given
it
.
<EOS>
They
walked
together
hand
in
hand
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
sit
down
in
the
hollow
,
"
said
Philip
,
"
where
we
stood
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
See
how
the
dog
-
roses
have
strewed
the
ground
,
and
spread
their
opal
petals
over
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
sat
down
at
the
roots
of
the
slanting
ash
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
begun
my
picture
of
you
among
the
Scotch
firs
,
Maggie
,
"
said
Philip
,
"
<EOS>
so
you
must
let
me
study
your
face
a
little
,
while
you
stay
,
 
since
I
am
not
to
see
it
again
.
<EOS>
Please
turn
your
head
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
said
in
an
entreating
voice
,
and
it
would
have
been
very
hard
of
Maggie
to
refuse
.
<EOS>
The
full
,
lustrous
face
,
with
the
bright
black
coronet
,
looked
down
like
that
of
a
divinity
well
pleased
to
be
worshipped
,
on
the
pale
-
hued
,
small
-
featured
face
that
was
turned
up
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
sitting
for
my
second
portrait
then
,
"
she
said
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Will
it
be
larger
than
the
other
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
much
larger
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
oil
-
painting
.
<EOS>
You
will
look
like
a
tall
Hamadryad
,
dark
and
strong
and
noble
,
just
issued
from
one
of
the
fir
-
trees
,
when
the
stems
are
casting
their
afternoon
shadows
on
the
grass
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
think
more
of
painting
than
of
anything
now
,
Philip
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
do
,
"
said
Philip
,
rather
sadly
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
think
of
too
many
things
,
 
sow
all
sorts
of
seeds
,
and
get
no
great
harvest
from
any
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
'm
cursed
with
susceptibility
in
every
direction
,
and
effective
faculty
in
none
.
<EOS>
I
care
for
painting
and
music
;
I
care
for
classic
literature
,
and
mediæval
literature
,
and
modern
literature
;
I
flutter
all
ways
,
and
fly
in
none
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
surely
that
is
a
happiness
to
have
so
many
tastes
,
 
to
enjoy
so
many
beautiful
things
,
when
they
are
within
your
reach
,
"
said
Maggie
,
musingly
.
<EOS>
"
It
always
seemed
to
me
a
sort
of
clever
stupidity
only
to
have
one
sort
of
talent
,
 
almost
like
a
carrier
-
pigeon
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
might
be
a
happiness
to
have
many
tastes
if
I
were
like
other
men
,
"
said
Philip
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
I
might
get
some
power
and
distinction
by
mere
mediocrity
,
as
they
do
;
at
least
I
should
get
those
middling
satisfactions
which
make
men
contented
to
do
without
great
ones
.
<EOS>
I
might
think
society
at
St.
Ogg
's
agreeable
then
.
<EOS>
But
nothing
could
make
life
worth
<EOS>
the
purchase
-
money
of
pain
to
me
,
but
some
faculty
that
would
lift
me
above
the
dead
level
of
provincial
existence
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
there
is
one
thing
,
 
a
passion
answers
as
well
as
a
faculty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
did
not
hear
the
last
words
;
she
was
struggling
against
the
consciousness
that
Philip
's
words
had
set
her
own
discontent
vibrating
again
as
it
used
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
what
you
mean
,
"
she
said
,
"
though
I
know
so
much
less
than
you
do
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
think
I
could
never
bear
life
if
it
kept
on
being
the
same
every
day
,
and
I
must
always
be
doing
things
of
no
consequence
,
and
never
know
anything
greater
.
<EOS>
But
,
dear
Philip
,
I
think
we
are
only
like
children
that
some
one
who
is
wiser
is
taking
care
of
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
right
to
resign
ourselves
entirely
,
<EOS>
whatever
may
be
denied
us
?
<EOS>
I
have
found
great
peace
in
that
for
the
last
two
or
three
years
,
even
joy
in
subduing
my
own
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Maggie
,
"
said
Philip
,
vehemently
;
"
and
you
are
shutting
yourself
up
in
a
narrow
,
self
-
delusive
fanaticism
,
which
is
only
a
way
of
escaping
pain
by
starving
into
dulness
all
the
highest
powers
of
your
nature
.
<EOS>
Joy
and
peace
are
not
resignation
;
resignation
is
the
willing
endurance
of
a
pain
that
is
not
allayed
,
that
you
do
n't
expect
to
be
allayed
.
<EOS>
Stupefaction
is
not
resignation
;
and
it
is
stupefaction
to
remain
in
ignorance
,
 
to
shut
up
all
the
avenues
by
which
the
life
of
your
fellow
-
men
might
become
known
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
resigned
;
I
am
not
sure
that
life
is
long
enough
to
learn
that
lesson
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
are
not
resigned
;
you
are
only
trying
to
stupefy
yourself
.

trembled
;
she
felt
there
was
some
truth
in
what
Philip
said
,
and
yet
there
was
a
deeper
consciousness
that
,
for
any
immediate
application
it
had
to
her
conduct
,
it
was
no
better
than
falsity
.
<EOS>
Her
double
impression
corresponded
to
the
double
impulse
of
the
speaker
.
<EOS>
Philip
seriously
believed
what
he
said
,
but
he
said
it
with
vehemence
because
it
made
an
argument
against
the
resolution
that
opposed
his
wishes
.
<EOS>
But
Maggie
's
face
,
made
more
childlike
by
the
gathering
tears
,
touched
him
with
a
tenderer
,
less
egotistic
feeling
.
<EOS>
He
took
her
hand
and
said
gently
:
  
"
Do
n't
let
us
think
of
such
things
in
this
short
half
-
hour
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
Let
us
only
care
about
being
together
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
friends
in
spite
of
separation
.
<EOS>
We
shall
always
think
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
glad
to
live
as
long
as
you
are
alive
,
because
I
shall
think
there
may
always
come
a
time
<EOS>
when
I
can
 
when
you
will
let
me
help
you
in
some
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
What
a
dear
,
good
brother
you
would
have
been
,
Philip
,
"
said
Maggie
,
smiling
through
the
haze
of
tears
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
would
have
made
as
much
fuss
about
me
,
and
been
as
pleased
for
me
to
love
you
,
as
would
have
satisfied
even
me
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
loved
me
well
enough
to
bear
with
me
,
and
forgive
me
everything
.
<EOS>
That
was
what
I
always
longed
that
Tom
should
do
.
<EOS>
I
was
never
satisfied
with
a
_
little
_
of
anything
.
<EOS>
That
is
why
it
is
better
for
me
to
do
without
earthly
happiness
altogether
.
<EOS>
I
never
felt
that
I
had
enough
music
,
 
I
wanted
more
instruments
playing
together
;
I
wanted
voices
to
be
fuller
and
deeper
.
<EOS>
Do
you
ever
sing
now
,
Philip
?
"
<EOS>
she
added
abruptly
,
as
if
she
had
forgotten
what
went
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
,
"
every
day
,
almost
.
<EOS>
But
my
voice
is
only
middling
,
like
everything
else
in
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sing
me
something
,
 
just
one
song
.
<EOS>
I
_
may
_
listen
to
that
before
I
go
,
 
something
you
used
to
sing
at
Lorton
on
a
Saturday
afternoon
,
when
we
had
the
drawing
-
room
all
to
ourselves
,
and
I
put
my
apron
over
my
head
to
listen
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
know
,
"
said
Philip
;
and
Maggie
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
while
he
sang
_
sotto
voce
_
,
<EOS>
"
Love
in
her
eyes
sits
playing
,
"
and
then
said
,
"
That
's
it
,
is
n't
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
I
wo
n't
stay
,
"
said
Maggie
,
starting
up
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
only
haunt
me
.
<EOS>
Let
us
walk
,
Philip
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
moved
away
,
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
rise
and
follow
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
tone
of
remonstrance
,
"
do
n't
persist
in
this
wilful
,
senseless
privation
.
<EOS>
It
makes
me
wretched
to
see
you
benumbing
and
cramping
your
nature
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
You
were
so
full
of
life
when
you
were
a
child
;
I
thought
you
would
be
a
brilliant
woman
,
 
all
wit
and
bright
imagination
.
<EOS>
And
it
flashes
out
in
your
face
still
,
until
you
draw
that
veil
of
dull
quiescence
over
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
speak
so
bitterly
to
me
,
Philip
?
"
said
Maggie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
foresee
it
will
not
end
well
;
you
can
never
carry
on
this
self
-
torture
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
strength
given
me
,
"
said
Maggie
,
tremulously
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
you
will
not
,
Maggie
;
no
one
has
strength
given
to
do
what
is
unnatural
.
<EOS>
It
is
mere
cowardice
to
seek
safety
in
negations
.
<EOS>
No
character
becomes
strong
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
thrown
into
the
world
some
day
,
and
then
every
rational
satisfaction
of
your
nature
that
you
deny
now
will
assault
you
like
a
savage
appetite
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
started
and
paused
,
looking
at
Philip
with
alarm
in
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Philip
,
how
dare
you
shake
me
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
You
are
a
tempter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
am
not
;
but
love
gives
insight
,
Maggie
,
and
insight
often
gives
foreboding
.
<EOS>
_
Listen
_
to
me
,
 
<EOS>
let
_
me
<EOS>
_
supply
you
with
books
<EOS>
;
do
let
me
see
you
sometimes
,
 
be
your
brother
and
teacher
,
as
you
said
at
Lorton
.
<EOS>
It
is
less
wrong
that
you
should
see
me
than
that
you
should
be
committing
this
long
suicide
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
felt
unable
to
speak
.
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
and
walked
on
in
silence
,
till
they
came
to
the
end
of
the
Scotch
firs
,
and
she
put
out
her
hand
in
sign
of
parting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
banish
me
from
this
place
forever
,
then
,
Maggie
?
<EOS>
Surely
I
may
come
and
walk
in
it
sometimes
?
<EOS>
If
I
meet
you
by
chance
,
there
is
no
concealment
in
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
the
moment
when
our
resolution
seems
about
to
become
irrevocable
 
when
the
fatal
iron
gates
are
about
to
close
upon
us
 
that
tests
our
strength
.
<EOS>
Then
,
after
hours
of
clear
reasoning
and
firm
conviction
,
we
snatch
at
any
sophistry
that
will
nullify
our
long
struggles
,
and
bring
us
the
defeat
that
we
love
better
than
victory
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
felt
her
heart
leap
at
this
subterfuge
of
Philip
's
,
and
there
passed
over
her
face
that
almost
imperceptible
shock
which
accompanies
any
relief
.
<EOS>
He
saw
it
,
and
they
parted
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
sense
of
the
situation
was
too
complete
for
him
not
to
be
visited
with
glancing
fears
lest
he
had
been
intervening
too
presumptuously
in
the
action
of
Maggie
's
conscience
,
perhaps
for
a
selfish
end
.
<EOS>
But
no
!
 
<EOS>
he
persuaded
himself
his
end
was
not
selfish
.
<EOS>
He
had
little
hope
that
Maggie
would
ever
return
the
strong
feeling
he
had
for
her
;
and
it
must
be
better
for
Maggie
's
future
life
,
when
these
petty
family
obstacles
to
her
freedom
had
disappeared
,
that
the
present
should
not
be
entirely
sacrificed
,
and
that
she
should
have
some
opportunity
of
culture
,
 
<EOS>
some
interchange
with
a
mind
above
the
vulgar
level
of
those
she
was
now
condemned
to
live
with
.
<EOS>
If
we
only
look
far
enough
off
for
the
consequence
of
our
actions
,
we
can
always
find
some
point
in
the
combination
of
results
by
which
those
actions
can
be
justified
;
by
adopting
the
point
of
view
of
a
Providence
who
arranges
results
,
or
of
a
philosopher
who
traces
them
,
we
shall
find
it
possible
to
obtain
perfect
complacency
in
choosing
to
do
what
is
most
agreeable
to
us
in
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
in
this
way
that
Philip
justified
his
subtle
efforts
to
overcome
Maggie
's
true
prompting
against
a
concealment
that
would
introduce
doubleness
into
her
own
mind
,
and
might
cause
new
misery
to
those
who
had
the
primary
natural
claim
on
her
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
surplus
of
passion
in
him
that
made
him
half
independent
of
justifying
motives
.
<EOS>
His
longing
to
see
Maggie
,
and
make
an
element
in
her
life
,
had
in
it
some
of
that
savage
impulse
to
snatch
an
offered
joy
which
springs
from
a
life
in
which
the
mental
and
bodily
constitution
have
made
pain
predominate
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
his
full
share
in
the
common
good
of
men
;
he
could
not
even
pass
muster
with
the
insignificant
,
but
must
be
singled
out
for
pity
,
and
excepted
from
what
was
a
matter
of
course
with
others
.
<EOS>
Even
to
Maggie
he
was
an
exception
;
it
was
clear
that
the
thought
of
his
being
her
lover
had
never
entered
her
mind
.
  
<EOS>
Do
not
think
too
hardly
of
Philip
.
<EOS>
Ugly
and
deformed
people
have
great
need
of
unusual
virtues
,
because
they
are
likely
to
be
extremely
uncomfortable
without
them
;
but
the
theory
that
unusual
virtues
spring
by
a
direct
consequence
out
of
personal
disadvantages
,
as
animals
get
thicker
wool
in
severe
climates
,
is
perhaps
a
little
overstrained
.
<EOS>
The
temptations
of
beauty
are
much
dwelt
upon
,
but
I
fancy
they
only
bear
the
same
relation
to
those
of
ugliness
,
as
the
temptation
to
excess
at
a
feast
,
where
the
delights
are
varied
for
eye
and
ear
as
well
as
palate
,
bears
to
the
temptations
that
assail
the
desperation
of
hunger
.
<EOS>
Does
not
the
Hunger
Tower
stand
as
the
type
of
the
utmost
trial
to
what
is
human
in
us
?
  
<EOS>
Philip
had
never
been
soothed
by
that
mother
's
love
which
flows
out
to
us
in
the
greater
abundance
because
our
need
is
greater
,
which
clings
to
us
the
more
tenderly
because
we
are
the
less
likely
to
be
winners
in
the
game
of
life
;
and
the
sense
of
his
father
's
affection
and
indulgence
toward
him
was
marred
by
the
keener
perception
of
his
father
's
faults
.
<EOS>
Kept
aloof
from
all
practical
life
as
Philip
had
been
,
and
by
nature
half
feminine
in
sensitiveness
,
he
had
some
of
the
woman
's
intolerant
repulsion
toward
worldliness
and
the
deliberate
pursuit
of
sensual
enjoyment
;
and
this
one
strong
natural
tie
in
his
life
,
 
his
relation
as
a
son
,
 
was
like
an
aching
limb
to
him
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
there
is
inevitably
something
morbid
in
a
human
being
who
is
in
any
way
unfavorably
excepted
from
ordinary
conditions
,
until
the
good
force
has
had
time
to
triumph
;
and
it
has
rarely
had
time
for
that
at
two
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
That
force
was
present
in
Philip
in
much
strength
,
but
the
sun
himself
looks
feeble
through
the
morning
mists
.
    
<EOS>
Another
Love
-
Scene
  
<EOS>
Early
in
the
following
April
,
nearly
a
year
after
that
dubious
parting
you
have
just
witnessed
,
you
may
,
if
you
like
,
again
see
Maggie
entering
the
Red
Deeps
through
the
group
of
Scotch
firs
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
early
afternoon
and
not
evening
,
and
the
edge
of
sharpness
in
the
spring
air
makes
her
draw
her
large
shawl
close
about
her
and
trip
along
rather
quickly
;
though
she
looks
round
,
as
usual
,
that
she
may
take
in
the
sight
of
her
beloved
trees
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
more
eager
,
inquiring
look
in
her
eyes
than
there
was
last
June
,
and
a
smile
is
hovering
about
her
lips
,
as
if
some
playful
speech
were
awaiting
the
right
hearer
.
<EOS>
The
hearer
was
not
long
in
appearing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
back
your
_
Corinne
_
,
"
said
Maggie
,
drawing
a
book
from
under
her
shawl
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
right
in
telling
me
she
would
do
me
<EOS>
no
good
;
<EOS>
but
you
were
wrong
in
thinking
I
should
wish
to
be
like
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
n't
you
really
like
to
be
a
tenth
Muse
,
then
,
Maggie
?
"
said
Philip
looking
up
in
her
face
as
we
look
at
a
first
parting
in
the
clouds
that
promises
us
a
bright
heaven
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
said
Maggie
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Muses
were
uncomfortable
goddesses
,
I
think
,
 
obliged
always
to
carry
rolls
and
musical
instruments
about
with
them
.
<EOS>
If
I
carried
a
harp
in
this
climate
,
you
know
,
I
must
have
a
green
baize
cover
for
it
;
and
I
should
be
sure
to
leave
it
behind
me
by
mistake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
agree
with
me
in
not
liking
Corinne
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
finish
the
book
,
"
said
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
I
came
to
the
blond
-
haired
young
lady
reading
in
the
park
,
I
shut
it
up
,
and
determined
to
read
no
further
.
<EOS>
I
foresaw
that
that
light
-
complexioned
girl
would
win
away
all
the
love
from
Corinne
and
make
her
miserable
.
<EOS>
I
'm
determined
to
read
no
more
books
where
the
blond
-
haired
women
carry
away
all
the
happiness
.
<EOS>
I
should
begin
to
have
a
prejudice
against
them
.
<EOS>
If
you
could
give
me
some
story
,
now
,
where
the
dark
woman
triumphs
,
it
would
restore
the
balance
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
avenge
Rebecca
and
Flora
MacIvor
and
Minna
,
and
all
the
rest
of
the
dark
unhappy
ones
.
<EOS>
Since
you
are
my
tutor
,
you
ought
to
preserve
my
mind
from
prejudices
;
you
are
always
arguing
against
prejudices
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
perhaps
you
will
avenge
the
dark
women
in
your
own
person
,
and
carry
away
all
the
love
from
your
cousin
Lucy
.
<EOS>
She
is
sure
to
have
some
handsome
young
man
of
St.
Ogg
's
at
her
feet
now
;
and
you
have
only
to
shine
upon
him
 
your
fair
little
cousin
will
be
quite
quenched
in
your
beams
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Philip
,
that
is
not
pretty
of
you
,
to
apply
my
nonsense
to
anything
real
,
"
said
Maggie
,
looking
hurt
.
<EOS>
"
As
if
I
,
with
my
old
gowns
and
want
of
all
accomplishments
,
could
be
a
rival
of
dear
little
Lucy
,
 
who
knows
and
does
all
sorts
of
charming
things
,
and
is
ten
times
prettier
than
I
am
,
 
even
if
I
were
odious
and
base
enough
to
wish
to
be
her
rival
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
never
go
to
aunt
Deane
's
<EOS>
when
any
one
is
there
;
it
is
only
because
dear
Lucy
is
good
,
and
loves
me
,
that
she
comes
to
see
me
,
and
will
have
me
go
to
see
her
sometimes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
"
said
Philip
,
with
surprise
,
"
it
is
not
like
you
to
take
playfulness
literally
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
been
in
St.
Ogg
's
this
morning
,
and
brought
away
a
slight
infection
of
dulness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Maggie
,
smiling
,
"
if
you
meant
that
for
a
joke
,
it
was
a
poor
one
<EOS>
;
but
I
thought
it
was
a
very
good
reproof
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
wanted
to
remind
me
that
I
am
vain
,
and
wish
every
one
to
admire
me
most
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
n't
for
that
that
I
'm
jealous
for
the
dark
women
,
 
<EOS>
not
because
I
'm
dark
myself
;
it
's
because
I
always
care
the
most
about
the
unhappy
people
.
<EOS>
If
the
blond
girl
were
forsaken
,
I
should
like
_
her
_
best
.
<EOS>
I
always
take
the
side
of
the
rejected
lover
in
the
stories
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
would
never
have
the
heart
to
reject
one
yourself
,
should
you
,
Maggie
?
"
said
Philip
,
flushing
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Maggie
,
hesitatingly
.
<EOS>
Then
with
a
bright
smile
,
"
I
think
perhaps
I
could
if
he
were
very
conceited
;
<EOS>
and
yet
,
if
he
got
extremely
humiliated
afterward
,
I
should
relent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
often
wondered
,
Maggie
,
"
Philip
said
,
with
some
effort
,
"
whether
you
would
n't
really
be
more
likely
to
love
a
man
that
other
women
were
not
likely
to
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
would
depend
on
what
they
did
n't
like
him
for
,
"
said
Maggie
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
He
might
be
very
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
He
might
look
at
me
through
an
eye
-
glass
stuck
in
his
eye
,
making
a
hideous
face
,
as
young
Torry
does
.
<EOS>
I
should
think
other
women
are
not
fond
of
that
;
but
I
never
felt
any
pity
for
young
Torry
.
<EOS>
I
've
never
any
pity
for
conceited
people
,
because
I
think
they
carry
their
comfort
about
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
suppose
,
Maggie
,
 
suppose
it
was
a
man
who
was
not
conceited
,
who
felt
he
had
nothing
to
be
conceited
about
;
who
had
been
marked
from
childhood
for
a
peculiar
kind
of
suffering
,
and
to
whom
you
were
the
day
-
star
of
his
life
;
who
loved
you
,
worshipped
you
,
so
entirely
that
he
felt
it
happiness
enough
for
him
if
you
would
let
him
see
you
at
rare
moments
   
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
paused
with
a
pang
of
dread
lest
his
confession
should
cut
short
this
very
happiness
,
 
a
pang
of
the
same
dread
that
had
kept
his
love
mute
through
long
months
.
<EOS>
A
rush
of
self
-
consciousness
told
him
that
he
was
besotted
to
have
said
all
this
.
<EOS>
Maggie
's
manner
this
morning
had
been
as
unconstrained
and
indifferent
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
was
not
looking
indifferent
now
.
<EOS>
Struck
with
the
unusual
emotion
in
Philip
's
tone
,
she
had
turned
quickly
to
look
at
him
;
and
as
he
went
on
speaking
,
a
great
change
came
over
her
face
,
 
a
flush
and
slight
spasm
of
the
features
,
such
as
we
see
in
people
who
hear
some
news
that
will
require
them
to
readjust
their
conceptions
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
silent
,
and
walking
on
toward
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
,
she
sat
down
,
as
if
she
had
no
strength
to
spare
for
her
muscles
.
<EOS>
She
was
trembling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
"
said
Philip
,
getting
more
and
more
alarmed
in
every
fresh
moment
of
silence
,
"
I
was
a
fool
to
say
it
;
forget
that
I
've
said
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
contented
if
things
can
be
as
they
were
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
distress
with
which
he
spoke
urged
Maggie
to
say
something
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
surprised
,
Philip
;
I
had
not
thought
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
effort
to
say
this
brought
the
tears
down
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
it
made
you
hate
me
,
Maggie
?
<EOS>
"
said
Philip
,
impetuously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
'm
a
presumptuous
fool
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Philip
!
"
said
Maggie
,
"
how
can
you
think
I
have
such
feelings
?
<EOS>
As
if
I
were
not
grateful
for
_
any
_
love
.
<EOS>
But
 
but
I
had
never
thought
of
your
being
my
lover
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
so
far
off
 
like
a
dream
 
only
like
one
of
the
stories
one
imagines
 
that
I
should
ever
have
a
lover
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
can
you
bear
to
think
of
me
as
your
lover
,
Maggie
?
"
said
Philip
,
seating
himself
by
her
,
and
taking
her
hand
,
in
the
elation
of
a
sudden
hope
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
_
Do
_
you
love
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
turned
rather
pale
;
this
direct
question
seemed
not
easy
to
answer
.
<EOS>
But
her
eyes
met
Philip
's
,
which
were
in
this
moment
liquid
and
beautiful
with
beseeching
love
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
with
hesitation
,
yet
with
sweet
,
simple
,
girlish
tenderness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
could
hardly
love
any
one
better
;
there
is
nothing
but
<EOS>
what
I
love
you
for
.
"
<EOS>
She
paused
a
little
while
,
and
then
added
:
"
But
it
will
be
better
for
us
not
to
say
any
more
about
it
,
wo
n't
it
,
dear
Philip
?
<EOS>
You
know
we
could
n't
even
be
friends
,
if
our
friendship
were
discovered
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
felt
that
I
was
right
in
giving
way
about
seeing
you
,
though
it
has
been
so
precious
to
me
in
some
ways
;
and
now
the
fear
comes
upon
me
strongly
again
,
that
it
will
lead
to
evil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
no
evil
has
come
,
Maggie
;
and
if
you
had
been
guided
by
that
fear
before
,
you
would
only
have
lived
through
another
dreary
,
benumbing
year
,
instead
of
reviving
into
your
real
self
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
very
sweet
,
I
know
,
 
all
the
talking
together
,
and
the
books
,
and
the
feeling
that
I
had
the
walk
to
look
forward
to
,
when
I
could
tell
you
the
thoughts
that
had
come
into
my
head
while
I
was
away
from
you
.
<EOS>
But
it
has
made
me
restless
;
it
has
made
me
think
a
great
deal
about
the
world
;
and
I
have
impatient
thoughts
again
,
 
<EOS>
I
get
weary
of
my
home
;
and
then
it
cuts
me
to
the
heart
afterward
,
that
I
should
ever
have
felt
weary
of
my
father
and
mother
.
<EOS>
I
think
what
you
call
being
benumbed
was
better
 
better
for
me
 
for
then
my
selfish
desires
were
benumbed
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
had
risen
again
,
and
was
walking
backward
and
forward
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Maggie
,
you
have
wrong
ideas
of
self
-
conquest
,
as
I
've
often
told
you
.
<EOS>
What
you
call
self
-
conquest
 
binding
and
deafening
yourself
to
all
but
one
train
of
impressions
 
is
only
the
culture
of
monomania
in
a
nature
like
yours
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
with
some
irritation
,
but
now
he
sat
down
by
her
again
and
took
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
think
of
the
past
now
,
Maggie
;
think
only
of
our
love
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
really
cling
to
me
with
all
your
heart
,
every
obstacle
will
be
overcome
in
time
;
we
need
only
wait
.
<EOS>
I
can
live
on
hope
.
<EOS>
Look
at
me
,
Maggie
;
tell
me
again
it
is
possible
for
you
to
love
me
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
look
away
from
me
to
that
cloven
tree
;
it
is
a
bad
omen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
turned
her
large
dark
glance
upon
him
with
a
sad
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Maggie
,
say
one
kind
word
,
or
else
you
were
better
to
me
at
Lorton
.
<EOS>
You
asked
me
if
I
should
like
you
to
kiss
me
,
 
do
n't
you
remember
?
 
<EOS>
and
you
promised
to
kiss
me
when
you
met
me
again
.
<EOS>
You
never
kept
the
promise
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
recollection
of
that
childish
time
came
as
a
sweet
relief
to
Maggie
.
<EOS>
It
made
the
present
moment
less
strange
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
kissed
him
almost
as
simply
and
quietly
as
she
had
done
when
she
was
twelve
years
old
.
<EOS>
Philip
's
eyes
flashed
with
delight
,
but
his
next
words
were
words
of
discontent
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
seem
happy
enough
,
Maggie
;
you
are
forcing
yourself
to
say
you
love
me
,
out
of
pity
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
Philip
,
"
said
Maggie
,
shaking
her
head
,
in
her
old
childish
way
;
"
I
'm
telling
you
the
truth
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
new
and
strange
to
me
;
but
I
do
n't
think
I
could
love
any
one
better
than
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
always
to
live
with
you
 
to
make
you
happy
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
been
happy
when
I
have
been
with
you
.
<EOS>
There
is
only
one
thing
I
will
not
do
for
your
sake
;
I
will
never
do
anything
to
wound
my
father
.
<EOS>
You
must
never
ask
that
from
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Maggie
,
I
will
ask
nothing
;
I
will
bear
everything
;
I
'll
wait
another
year
only
for
a
kiss
,
if
you
will
only
give
me
the
first
place
in
your
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Maggie
,
smiling
,
"
I
wo
n't
make
you
wait
so
long
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
But
then
,
looking
serious
again
,
she
added
,
as
she
rose
from
her
seat
,
    
"
<EOS>
But
what
would
your
own
father
say
,
Philip
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
it
is
quite
impossible
we
can
ever
be
more
than
friends
,
 
brother
and
sister
in
secret
,
as
we
have
been
.
<EOS>
Let
us
give
up
thinking
of
everything
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Maggie
,
I
ca
n't
give
you
up
,
 
unless
you
are
deceiving
me
;
unless
you
really
only
care
for
me
as
if
I
were
your
brother
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
the
truth
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
do
,
Philip
.
<EOS>
What
happiness
have
I
ever
had
so
great
as
being
with
you
,
 
since
I
was
a
little
girl
,
 
the
days
Tom
was
good
to
me
?
<EOS>
And
your
mind
is
a
sort
of
world
to
me
;
you
can
tell
me
all
I
want
to
know
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
never
be
tired
of
being
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
walking
hand
in
hand
,
looking
at
each
other
;
Maggie
,
indeed
,
was
hurrying
along
,
for
she
felt
it
time
to
be
gone
.
<EOS>
But
the
sense
that
their
parting
was
near
made
her
more
anxious
lest
she
should
have
unintentionally
left
some
painful
impression
on
Philip
's
mind
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
those
dangerous
moments
when
speech
is
at
once
sincere
and
deceptive
;
when
feeling
,
rising
high
above
its
average
depth
,
leaves
floodmarks
which
are
never
reached
again
.
  
<EOS>
They
stopped
to
part
among
the
Scotch
firs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
my
life
will
be
filled
with
hope
,
Maggie
,
and
I
shall
be
happier
than
other
men
,
in
spite
of
all
?
<EOS>
We
_
do
_
belong
to
each
other
 
for
always
 
whether
we
are
apart
or
together
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
Philip
;
I
should
like
never
to
part
;
I
should
like
to
make
your
life
very
happy
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
waiting
for
something
else
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
it
will
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
smiled
,
with
glistening
tears
,
and
then
stooped
her
tall
head
to
kiss
the
pale
face
that
was
full
of
pleading
,
timid
love
,
 
like
a
woman
's
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
a
moment
of
real
happiness
then
,
 
a
moment
of
belief
that
,
if
there
were
sacrifice
in
this
love
,
it
was
all
the
richer
and
more
satisfying
.
  
<EOS>
She
turned
away
and
hurried
home
,
feeling
that
in
the
hour
since
she
had
trodden
this
road
before
,
a
new
era
had
begun
for
her
.
<EOS>
The
tissue
of
vague
dreams
must
now
get
narrower
and
narrower
,
and
all
the
threads
of
thought
and
emotion
be
gradually
absorbed
in
the
woof
of
her
actual
daily
life
.
    
<EOS>
The
Cloven
Tree
  
Secrets
are
rarely
betrayed
or
discovered
according
to
any
programme
our
fear
has
sketched
out
.
<EOS>
Fear
is
almost
always
haunted
by
terrible
dramatic
scenes
,
which
recur
in
spite
of
the
best
-
argued
probabilities
against
them
;
and
during
a
year
that
Maggie
had
had
the
burthen
of
concealment
on
her
mind
,
the
possibility
of
discovery
had
continually
presented
itself
under
the
form
of
a
sudden
meeting
with
her
father
or
Tom
when
she
was
walking
with
Philip
in
the
Red
Deeps
.
<EOS>
She
was
aware
that
this
was
not
one
of
the
most
likely
events
;
but
it
was
the
scene
that
most
completely
symbolized
her
inward
dread
.
<EOS>
Those
slight
indirect
suggestions
which
are
dependent
on
apparently
trivial
coincidences
and
incalculable
states
of
mind
,
are
the
favorite
machinery
of
Fact
,
but
are
not
the
stuff
in
which
Imagination
is
apt
to
work
.
  
<EOS>
Certainly
one
of
the
persons
about
whom
Maggie
's
fears
were
furthest
from
troubling
themselves
was
her
aunt
Pullet
,
on
whom
,
seeing
that
she
did
not
live
in
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
was
neither
sharp
-
eyed
nor
sharp
-
tempered
,
it
would
surely
have
been
quite
whimsical
of
them
to
fix
rather
than
on
aunt
Glegg
.
<EOS>
And
yet
the
channel
of
fatality
 
<EOS>
the
pathway
of
the
lightning
 
was
no
other
than
aunt
Pullet
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
live
at
St.
Ogg
's
,
but
the
road
from
Garum
Firs
lay
by
the
Red
Deeps
,
at
the
end
opposite
that
by
which
Maggie
entered
.
  
<EOS>
The
day
after
Maggie
's
last
meeting
with
Philip
,
being
a
Sunday
on
which
Mr.
Pullet
was
bound
to
appear
in
funeral
hatband
and
scarf
at
St.
Ogg
's
church
,
Mrs.
Pullet
made
this
the
occasion
of
dining
with
sister
Glegg
,
and
taking
tea
with
poor
sister
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
Sunday
was
the
one
day
in
the
week
on
which
Tom
was
at
home
in
the
afternoon
;
and
today
the
brighter
spirits
he
had
been
in
of
late
had
flowed
over
in
unusually
cheerful
open
chat
with
his
father
,
and
in
the
invitation
,
"
Come
,
Magsie
,
you
come
too
!
"
<EOS>
when
he
strolled
out
with
his
mother
in
the
garden
to
see
the
advancing
cherry
-
blossoms
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
better
pleased
with
Maggie
since
she
had
been
less
odd
and
ascetic
;
he
was
even
getting
rather
proud
of
her
;
several
persons
had
remarked
in
his
hearing
that
his
sister
was
a
very
fine
girl
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
there
was
a
peculiar
brightness
in
her
face
,
due
in
reality
to
an
undercurrent
of
excitement
,
which
had
as
much
doubt
and
pain
as
pleasure
in
it
;
but
it
might
pass
for
a
sign
of
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
look
very
well
,
my
dear
,
"
said
aunt
Pullet
,
shaking
her
head
sadly
,
as
they
sat
round
the
tea
-
table
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
niver
thought
your
girl
'
ud
be
so
good
-
looking
,
Bessy
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
wear
pink
,
my
dear
;
that
blue
thing
as
your
aunt
Glegg
gave
you
turns
you
into
a
crowflower
.
<EOS>
Jane
never
_
was
_
tasty
.
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
wear
that
gown
o
'
mine
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
pretty
and
so
smart
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
's
too
showy
for
me
,
 
at
least
for
my
other
clothes
,
that
I
must
wear
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
it
'
ud
be
unbecoming
if
it
was
n't
well
known
<EOS>
you
've
got
them
belonging
to
you
as
can
afford
to
give
you
such
things
when
they
've
done
with
'em
themselves
.
<EOS>
It
stands
to
reason
I
must
give
my
own
niece
clothes
now
and
then
,
 
such
things
as
_
<EOS>
I
_
buy
every
year
,
and
never
wear
anything
out
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
Lucy
,
there
's
no
giving
to
her
,
for
she
's
got
everything
<EOS>
o
'
the
choicest
<EOS>
;
sister
Deane
may
well
hold
her
head
up
,
 
though
she
looks
dreadful
yallow
,
poor
thing
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
this
liver
complaint
"
ull
carry
her
off
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
this
new
vicar
,
this
Dr.
Kenn
,
said
in
the
funeral
sermon
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
he
's
a
wonderful
preacher
,
by
all
account
,
 
is
n't
he
,
Sophy
?
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Lucy
had
got
a
collar
on
this
blessed
day
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Pullet
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
in
a
ruminating
manner
,
"
as
I
do
n't
say
I
have
n't
got
as
good
,
but
I
must
look
out
my
best
to
match
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Miss
Lucy
's
called
the
bell
o
'
St.
Ogg
's
,
they
say
;
that
's
a
cur'ous
word
,
"
observed
Mr.
Pullet
,
on
whom
the
mysteries
of
etymology
sometimes
fell
with
an
oppressive
weight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
jealous
for
Maggie
,
"
she
's
a
small
thing
,
not
much
of
a
figure
.
<EOS>
But
fine
feathers
make
fine
birds
.
<EOS>
I
see
nothing
to
admire
so
much
in
those
diminutive
women
;
they
look
silly
by
the
side
o
'
the
men
,
 
out
o
'
proportion
.
<EOS>
When
I
chose
my
wife
,
I
chose
her
the
right
size
,
 
neither
too
little
nor
too
big
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
poor
wife
,
with
her
withered
beauty
,
smiled
complacently
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
men
are
n't
_
all
_
big
,
"
said
uncle
Pullet
,
not
without
some
self
-
reference
;
"
a
young
fellow
may
be
good
-
looking
and
yet
not
be
a
six
-
foot
,
like
Master
Tom
here
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
it
's
poor
talking
about
littleness
and
bigness
,
 
<EOS>
anybody
may
think
it
's
a
mercy
they
're
straight
,
"
said
aunt
Pullet
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
that
mismade
son
o
'
Lawyer
Wakem
's
,
I
saw
him
at
church
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
!
<EOS>
to
think
o
'
the
property
he
's
like
to
have
;
and
they
say
he
's
very
queer
and
lonely
,
does
n't
like
much
company
.
<EOS>
I
should
n't
wonder
if
he
goes
out
of
his
mind
;
for
we
never
come
along
the
road
<EOS>
but
he
's
<EOS>
a
-
scrambling
out
o
'
the
trees
and
brambles
at
the
Red
Deeps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
wide
statement
,
by
which
Mrs.
Pullet
represented
the
fact
that
she
had
twice
seen
Philip
at
the
spot
indicated
,
produced
an
effect
on
Maggie
which
was
all
the
stronger
because
Tom
sate
opposite
her
,
and
she
was
intensely
anxious
to
look
indifferent
.
<EOS>
At
Philip
's
name
she
had
blushed
,
and
the
blush
deepened
every
instant
from
consciousness
,
until
the
mention
of
the
Red
Deeps
made
her
feel
as
if
the
whole
secret
were
betrayed
,
and
she
dared
not
even
hold
her
tea
-
spoon
lest
she
should
show
how
she
trembled
.
<EOS>
She
sat
with
her
hands
clasped
under
the
table
,
not
daring
to
look
round
.
<EOS>
Happily
,
her
father
was
seated
on
the
same
side
with
herself
,
beyond
her
uncle
Pullet
,
and
could
not
see
her
face
without
stooping
forward
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
's
voice
brought
the
first
relief
,
turning
the
conversation
;
for
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
always
alarmed
when
the
name
of
Wakem
was
mentioned
in
her
husband
's
presence
.
<EOS>
Gradually
Maggie
recovered
composure
enough
to
look
up
;
her
eyes
met
Tom
's
,
but
he
turned
away
his
head
immediately
;
and
she
went
to
bed
that
night
wondering
if
he
had
gathered
any
suspicion
from
her
confusion
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
not
;
perhaps
he
would
think
it
was
only
her
alarm
at
her
aunt
's
mention
of
Wakem
before
her
father
;
that
was
the
interpretation
her
mother
had
put
in
it
.
<EOS>
To
her
father
,
Wakem
was
like
a
disfiguring
disease
,
of
which
he
was
obliged
to
endure
the
consciousness
,
but
was
exasperated
to
have
the
existence
recognized
by
others
;
and
no
amount
of
sensitiveness
in
her
about
her
father
could
be
surprising
,
Maggie
thought
.
  
<EOS>
But
Tom
was
too
keen
-
sighted
to
rest
satisfied
with
such
an
interpretation
;
he
had
seen
clearly
enough
that
there
was
something
distinct
from
anxiety
about
her
father
in
Maggie
's
excessive
confusion
.
<EOS>
In
trying
to
recall
all
the
details
that
could
give
shape
to
his
suspicions
,
he
remembered
only
lately
hearing
his
mother
scold
Maggie
for
walking
in
the
Red
Deeps
when
the
ground
was
wet
,
and
bringing
home
shoes
clogged
with
red
soil
;
<EOS>
still
Tom
,
retaining
all
his
old
repulsion
for
Philip
's
deformity
,
shrank
from
attributing
to
his
sister
the
probability
of
feeling
more
than
a
friendly
interest
in
such
an
unfortunate
exception
to
the
common
run
of
men
.
<EOS>
Tom
's
was
a
nature
which
had
a
sort
of
superstitious
repugnance
to
everything
exceptional
.
<EOS>
A
love
for
a
deformed
man
would
be
odious
in
any
woman
,
in
a
sister
intolerable
.
<EOS>
But
if
she
had
been
carrying
on
any
kind
of
intercourse
whatever
with
Philip
,
a
stop
must
be
put
to
it
at
once
;
she
was
disobeying
her
father
's
strongest
feelings
and
her
brother
's
express
commands
,
besides
compromising
herself
by
secret
meetings
.
<EOS>
He
left
home
the
next
morning
in
that
watchful
state
of
mind
which
turns
the
most
ordinary
course
of
things
into
pregnant
coincidences
.
  
<EOS>
That
afternoon
,
about
half
-
past
three
o'clock
,
Tom
was
standing
on
the
wharf
,
talking
with
Bob
Jakin
about
the
probability
of
the
good
ship
<EOS>
Adelaide
coming
in
,
in
a
day
or
two
,
with
results
highly
important
to
both
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
"
said
Bob
,
parenthetically
,
as
he
looked
over
the
fields
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
,
"
there
goes
that
crooked
young
Wakem
.
<EOS>
I
know
him
or
his
shadder
as
far
off
as
I
can
see
'em
;
I
'm
allays
lighting
on
him
o
'
<EOS>
that
side
the
river
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
sudden
thought
seemed
to
have
darted
through
Tom
's
mind
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
,
Bob
,
"
he
said
;
"
I
've
something
to
attend
to
,
"
hurrying
off
to
the
warehouse
,
where
he
left
notice
for
some
one
to
take
his
place
;
he
was
called
away
home
on
peremptory
business
.
  
<EOS>
The
swiftest
pace
and
the
shortest
road
took
him
to
the
gate
,
and
he
was
pausing
to
open
it
deliberately
,
that
he
might
walk
into
the
house
with
an
appearance
of
perfect
composure
,
when
Maggie
came
out
at
the
front
door
in
bonnet
and
shawl
.
<EOS>
His
conjecture
was
fulfilled
,
and
he
waited
for
her
at
the
gate
.
<EOS>
She
started
violently
when
she
saw
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
how
is
it
you
are
come
home
?
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
Maggie
spoke
in
a
low
,
tremulous
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
come
to
walk
with
you
to
the
Red
Deeps
,
and
meet
Philip
Wakem
,
"
said
Tom
,
the
central
fold
in
his
brow
,
which
had
become
habitual
with
him
,
deepening
as
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
stood
helpless
,
pale
and
cold
.
<EOS>
By
some
means
,
then
,
Tom
knew
everything
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
said
,
"
I
'm
not
going
,
"
and
turned
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
are
;
but
I
want
to
speak
to
you
first
.
<EOS>
Where
is
my
father
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Out
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
my
mother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
yard
,
I
think
,
with
the
poultry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
go
in
,
then
,
without
her
seeing
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
They
walked
in
together
,
and
<EOS>
Tom
,
entering
the
parlor
,
said
to
Maggie
,
"
Come
in
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
obeyed
,
and
he
closed
the
door
behind
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Maggie
,
tell
me
this
instant
everything
that
has
passed
between
you
and
Philip
Wakem
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Does
my
father
know
anything
?
"
said
Maggie
,
still
trembling
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Tom
indignantly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
he
_
shall
_
know
,
if
you
attempt
to
use
deceit
toward
me
any
further
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
wish
to
use
deceit
,
"
said
Maggie
,
flushing
into
resentment
at
hearing
this
word
applied
to
her
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
the
whole
truth
,
then
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
whether
I
know
it
or
not
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
exactly
what
has
happened
,
or
my
father
shall
know
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
it
for
my
father
's
sake
,
then
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
becomes
you
to
profess
affection
for
your
father
,
when
you
have
despised
his
strongest
feelings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
do
wrong
,
Tom
,
"
said
Maggie
,
tauntingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
if
I
know
it
,
"
answered
Tom
,
with
proud
sincerity
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
beyond
this
:
tell
me
what
has
passed
between
you
and
Philip
Wakem
.
<EOS>
When
did
you
first
meet
him
in
the
Red
Deeps
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
year
ago
,
"
said
Maggie
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
Tom
's
severity
gave
her
a
certain
fund
of
defiance
,
and
kept
her
sense
of
error
in
abeyance
.
<EOS>
"
You
need
ask
me
no
more
questions
.
<EOS>
We
have
been
friendly
a
year
.
<EOS>
We
have
met
and
walked
together
often
.
<EOS>
He
has
lent
me
books
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
"
said
Tom
,
looking
straight
at
her
with
his
frown
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
paused
a
moment
;
then
,
determined
to
make
an
end
of
Tom
's
right
to
accuse
her
of
deceit
,
she
said
haughtily
:
  
"
No
,
not
quite
all
.
<EOS>
On
Saturday
he
told
me
that
he
loved
me
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
think
of
it
before
then
;
I
had
only
thought
of
him
as
an
old
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
_
encouraged
_
him
?
"
<EOS>
said
Tom
,
with
an
expression
of
disgust
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
him
that
I
loved
him
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
was
silent
a
few
moments
,
looking
on
the
ground
and
frowning
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
looked
up
and
said
coldly
,
    
"
Now
,
then
,
Maggie
,
there
are
but
two
courses
for
you
to
take
,
 
<EOS>
either
you
vow
solemnly
to
me
,
with
your
hand
on
my
father
's
Bible
,
that
you
will
never
have
another
meeting
or
speak
another
word
in
private
with
Philip
Wakem
,
or
you
refuse
,
and
I
tell
my
father
everything
;
and
this
month
,
when
by
my
exertions
he
might
be
made
happy
once
more
<EOS>
,
you
will
cause
him
the
blow
of
knowing
that
you
are
a
disobedient
,
deceitful
daughter
,
who
throws
away
her
own
respectability
by
clandestine
meetings
with
the
son
of
a
man
that
has
helped
to
ruin
her
father
.
<EOS>
Choose
!
"
<EOS>
Tom
ended
with
cold
decision
,
going
up
to
the
large
Bible
,
drawing
it
forward
,
and
opening
it
at
the
fly
-
leaf
,
where
the
writing
was
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
crushing
alternative
to
Maggie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
"
she
said
,
urged
out
of
pride
into
pleading
,
"
do
n't
ask
me
that
.
<EOS>
I
will
promise
you
to
give
up
all
intercourse
with
Philip
,
if
you
will
let
me
see
him
once
,
or
even
only
write
to
him
and
explain
everything
,
 
to
give
it
up
as
long
as
it
would
ever
cause
any
pain
to
my

<EOS>
I
feel
something
for
Philip
too

<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
is
not
happy

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
wish
to
hear
anything
of
your
feelings
;
I
have
said
exactly
what
I
mean

<EOS>
Choose
,
and
quickly
,
lest
my
mother
should
come
in

"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
give
you
my
word
,
that
will
be
as
strong
a
bond
to
me
as
if
I
laid
my
hand
on
the
Bible

<EOS>
I
do

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
what

I
_
require

"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
trust
you
,
Maggie

<EOS>
There
is
no
consistency
in
you

<EOS>
Put
your
hand
on
this
Bible
,
and
say
,
"
I
renounce
all
private
speech
and
intercourse
with
Philip
Wakem
from
this
time
forth
.
<EOS>
"
Else
you
will
bring
shame
on
us
all
,
and
grief
on
my
father
;
and
what
is
the
use
of
my
exerting
myself
and
giving
up
everything
else
for
the
sake
of
paying
my
father
's
debts
,
if
you
are
to
bring
madness
and
vexation
on
him
,
just
when
he
might
be
easy
and
hold
up
his
head
once
more
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Tom
,
_
will
_
the
debts
be
paid
soon
?
"
said
Maggie
,
clasping
her
hands
,
with
a
sudden
flash
of
joy
across
her
wretchedness
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
things
turn
out
as
I
expect
,
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
"
he
added
,
his
voice
trembling
with
indignation
,
"
while
I
have
been
contriving
and
working
that
my
father
may
have
some
peace
of
mind
before
he
dies
,
 
working
for
the
respectability
of
our
family
,
 
you
have
done
all
you
can
to
destroy
both
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
felt
a
deep
movement
of
compunction
;
for
the
moment
,
her
mind
ceased
to
contend
against
what
she
felt
to
be
cruel
and
unreasonable
,
and
in
her
self
-
blame
she
justified
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
"
she
said
in
a
low
voice
,
"
it
was
wrong
of
me
;
but
I
was
so
lonely
,
and
I
was
sorry
for
Philip
.
<EOS>
And
I
think
enmity
and
hatred
are
wicked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
duty
was
clear
enough
.
<EOS>
Say
no
more
;
but
promise
,
in
the
words
I
told
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
must
_
speak
to
Philip
once
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
go
with
me
now
and
speak
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
give
you
my
word
not
to
meet
him
or
write
to
him
again
without
your
knowledge
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
only
thing
I
will
say
.
<EOS>
I
will
put
my
hand
on
the
Bible
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
it
,
then
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
laid
her
hand
on
the
page
of
manuscript
and
repeated
the
promise
.
<EOS>
Tom
closed
the
book
,
and
said
,
"
Now
let
us
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
spoken
as
they
walked
along
.
<EOS>
Maggie
was
suffering
in
anticipation
of
what
Philip
was
about
to
suffer
,
and
dreading
the
galling
words
that
would
fall
on
him
from
Tom
's
lips
;
but
she
felt
it
was
in
vain
to
attempt
anything
but
submission
.
<EOS>
Tom
had
his
terrible
clutch
on
her
conscience
and
her
deepest
dread
;
she
writhed
under
the
demonstrable
truth
of
the
character
he
had
given
to
her
conduct
,
and
yet
her
whole
soul
rebelled
against
it
as
unfair
from
its
incompleteness
.
<EOS>
He
,
meanwhile
,
felt
the
impetus
of
his
indignation
diverted
toward
Philip
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
how
much
of
an
old
boyish
repulsion
and
of
mere
personal
pride
and
animosity
was
concerned
in
the
bitter
severity
of
the
words
by
which
he
meant
to
do
the
duty
of
a
son
and
a
brother
.
<EOS>
Tom
was
not
given
to
inquire
subtly
into
his
own
motives
any
more
than
into
other
matters
of
an
intangible
kind
;
he
was
quite
sure
that
his
own
motives
as
well
as
actions
were
good
,
else
he
would
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
only
hope
was
that
something
might
,
for
the
first
time
,
have
prevented
Philip
from
coming
.
<EOS>
Then
there
would
be
delay
,
 
then
she
might
get
Tom
's
permission
to
write
to
him
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
beat
with
double
violence
when
they
got
under
the
Scotch
firs
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
last
moment
of
suspense
,
she
thought
;
Philip
always
met
her
soon
after
she
got
beyond
them
.
<EOS>
But
they
passed
across
the
more
open
green
space
,
and
entered
the
narrow
bushy
path
by
the
mound
.
<EOS>
Another
turning
,
and
they
came
so
close
upon
him
that
both
Tom
and
Philip
stopped
suddenly
within
a
yard
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
moment
's
silence
,
in
which
Philip
darted
a
look
of
inquiry
at
Maggie
's
face
.
<EOS>
He
saw
an
answer
there
,
in
the
pale
,
parted
lips
,
and
the
terrified
tension
of
the
large
eyes
.
<EOS>
Her
imagination
,
always
rushing
extravagantly
beyond
an
immediate
impression
,
saw
her
tall
,
strong
brother
grasping
the
feeble
Philip
bodily
,
crushing
him
and
trampling
on
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
call
this
acting
the
part
of
a
man
and
a
gentleman
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tom
said
,
in
a
voice
of
harsh
scorn
,
as
soon
as
Philip
's
eyes
were
turned
on
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
answered
Philip
,
haughtily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mean
?
<EOS>
Stand
farther
from
me
,
lest
I
should
lay
hands
on
you
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
I
mean
,
taking
advantage
of
a
young
girl
's
foolishness
and
ignorance
to
get
her
to
have
secret
meetings
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
mean
,
daring
to
trifle
with
the
respectability
of
a
family
that
has
a
good
and
honest
name
to
support
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
deny
that
,
"
interrupted
Philip
,
impetuously
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
never
trifle
with
anything
that
affected
your
sister
's
happiness
.
<EOS>
She
is
dearer
to
me
than
she
is
to
you
;
I
honor
her
more
than
you
can
ever
honor
her
;
I
would
give
up
my
life
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
talk
high
-
flown
nonsense
to
me
,
sir
!
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
to
pretend
that
you
did
n't
know
it
would
be
injurious
to
her
to
meet
you
here
week
after
week
?
<EOS>
Do
you
pretend
you
had
any
right
to
make
professions
of
love
to
her
,
even
if
you
had
been
a
fit
husband
for
her
,
when
neither
her
father
nor
your
father
would
ever
consent
to
a
marriage
between
you
?
<EOS>
And
_
<EOS>
you
_
,
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
you
_
to
try
and
worm
yourself
into
the
affections
of
a
handsome
girl
who
is
not
eighteen
,
and
has
been
shut
out
from
the
world
by
her
father
's
misfortunes
!
<EOS>
That
's
your
crooked
notion
of
honor
,
is
it
?
<EOS>
I
call
it
base
treachery
;
I
call
it
taking
advantage
of
circumstances
to
win
what
's
too
good
for
you
,
 
what
you
'd
never
get
by
fair
means
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
manly
of
you
to
talk
in
this
way
to
_
me
_
,
"
said
Philip
,
bitterly
,
his
whole
frame
shaken
by
violent
emotions
.
<EOS>
"
Giants
have
an
immemorial
right
to
stupidity
and
insolent
abuse
.
<EOS>
You
are
incapable
even
of
understanding
what
I
feel
for
your
sister
.
<EOS>
I
feel
so
much
for
her
that
I
could
even
desire
to
be
at
friendship
with
_
<EOS>
you
_
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
sorry
to
understand
your
feelings
,
"
said
Tom
,
with
scorching
contempt
.
<EOS>
"
What
I
wish
is
that
you
should
understand
<EOS>
_
me
<EOS>
_
,
 
that
I
shall
take
care
of
_
my
_
sister
,
and
that
if
you
dare
to
make
the
least
attempt
to
come
near
her
,
or
to
write
to
her
,
or
to
keep
the
slightest
hold
on
her
mind
,
your
puny
,
miserable
body
,
that
ought
to
have
put
some
modesty
into
your
mind
,
shall
not
protect
you
.
<EOS>
I
'll
thrash
you
;
I
'll
hold
you
up
to
public
scorn
.
<EOS>
Who
would
n't
laugh
at
the
idea
of
_
your
_
turning
lover
to
a
fine
girl
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
and
Maggie
walked
on
in
silence
for
some
yards
.
<EOS>
He
burst
out
,
in
a
convulsed
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
Maggie
!
"
said
Philip
,
making
a
strong
effort
to
speak
.
<EOS>
Then
looking
at
Tom
,
"
You
have
dragged
your
sister
here
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
that
she
may
stand
by
while
you
threaten
and
insult
me
.
<EOS>
These
naturally
seemed
to
you
the
right
means
to
influence
me
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
mistaken
.
<EOS>
Let
your
sister
speak
.
<EOS>
If
she
says
she
is
bound
to
give
me
up
,
I
shall
abide
by
her
wishes
to
the
slightest
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
for
my
father
's
sake
,
Philip
,
"
said
Maggie
,
imploringly
.
<EOS>
"
Tom
threatens
to
tell
my
father
,
and
he
could
n't
bear
it
;
I
have
promised
,
I
have
vowed
solemnly
,
that
we
will
not
have
any
intercourse
without
my
brother
's
knowledge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
enough
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
shall
not
change
;
but
I
wish
you
to
hold
yourself
entirely
free
.
<EOS>
But
trust
me
;
remember
that
I
can
never
seek
for
anything
but
good
to
what
belongs
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Tom
,
exasperated
by
this
attitude
of
Philip
's
,
"
you
can
talk
of
seeking
good
for
her
and
what
belongs
to
her
now
;
did
you
seek
her
good
before
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
 
at
some
risk
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
But
I
wished
her
to
have
a
friend
for
life
,
 
who
would
cherish
her
,
who
would
do
her
more
justice
than
a
coarse
and
narrow
-
minded
brother
,
that
she
has
always
lavished
her
affections
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
way
of
befriending
her
is
different
from
yours
;
and
I
'll
tell
you
what
is
my
way
.
<EOS>
I
'll
save
her
from
disobeying
and
disgracing
her
father
;
I
'll
save
her
from
throwing
herself
away
on
you
,
 
from
making
herself
a
laughing
-
stock
,
 
from
being
flouted
by
a
man
like
_
your
_
father
,
because
she
's
not
good
enough
for
his
son
.
<EOS>
You
know
well
enough
what
sort
of
justice
and
cherishing
you
were
preparing
for
her
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
to
be
imposed
upon
by
fine
words
;
I
can
see
what
actions
mean
.
<EOS>
Come
away
,
Maggie
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
seized
Maggie
's
right
wrist
as
he
spoke
,
and
she
put
out
her
left
hand
.
<EOS>
Philip
clasped
it
an
instant
,
with
one
eager
look
,
and
then
hurried
away
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
and
Maggie
walked
on
in
silence
for
some
yards
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
holding
her
wrist
tightly
,
as
if
he
were
compelling
a
culprit
from
the
scene
of
action
.
<EOS>
At
last
Maggie
,
with
a
violent
snatch
,
drew
her
hand
away
,
and
her
pent
-
up
,
long
-
gathered
irritation
burst
into
utterance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
suppose
that
I
think
you
are
right
,
Tom
,
or
that
I
bow
to
your
will
.
<EOS>
I
despise
the
feelings
you
have
shown
in
speaking
to
Philip
;
I
detest
your
insulting
,
unmanly
allusions
to
his
deformity
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
reproaching
other
people
all
your
life
;
you
have
been
always
sure
you
yourself
are
right
.
<EOS>
It
is
because
you
have
not
a
mind
large
enough
to
see
that
there
is
anything
better
than
your
own
conduct
and
your
own
petty
aims
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
,
"
said
Tom
,
coolly
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
that
your
conduct
is
better
,
or
your
aims
either
.
<EOS>
If
your
conduct
,
and
Philip
Wakem
's
conduct
,
has
been
right
,
why
are
you
ashamed
of
its
being
known
?
<EOS>
Answer
me
that
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
have
aimed
at
in
my
conduct
,
and
I
've
succeeded
;
pray
<EOS>
,
what
good
has
your
conduct
brought
to
you
or
any
one
else
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
defend
myself
,
"
said
Maggie
,
still
with
vehemence
:
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
've
been
wrong
,
 
often
,
continually
.
<EOS>
But
yet
,
sometimes
when
I
have
done
wrong
,
it
has
been
because
I
have
feelings
that
you
would
be
the
better
for
,
if
you
had
them
.
<EOS>
If
_
you
_
were
in
fault
ever
,
if
you
had
done
anything
very
wrong
,
I
should
be
sorry
for
the
pain
it
brought
you
;
I
should
not
want
punishment
to
be
heaped
on
you
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
always
enjoyed
punishing
me
;
you
have
always
been
hard
and
cruel
to
me
;
even
when
I
was
a
little
girl
,
and
always
loved
you
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
,
you
would
let
me
go
crying
to
bed
without
forgiving
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
pity
;
you
have
no
sense
of
your
own
imperfection
and
your
own
sins
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
sin
to
be
hard
;
it
is
not
fitting
for
a
mortal
,
for
a
Christian
.
<EOS>
You
are
nothing
but
a
Pharisee
.
<EOS>
You
thank
God
for
nothing
but
your
own
virtues
;
you
think
they
are
great
enough
to
win
you
everything
else
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
even
a
vision
of
feelings
by
the
side
of
which
your
shining
virtues
are
mere
darkness
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Tom
,
with
cold
scorn
,
"
if
your
feelings
are
so
much
better
than
mine
,
let
me
see
you
show
them
in
some
other
way
than
by
conduct
that
's
likely
to
disgrace
us
all
,
 
than
by
ridiculous
flights
first
into
one
extreme
and
then
into
another
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
how
have
you
shown
your
love
,
that
you
talk
of
,
either
to
me
or
my
father
?
<EOS>
By
disobeying
and
deceiving
us
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
different
way
of
showing
my
affection
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Because
you
are
a
man
,
Tom
,
and
have
power
,
and
can
do
something
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
if
you
can
do
nothing
,
submit
to
those
that
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
_
will
_
submit
to
what
I
acknowledge
and
feel
to
be
right
.
<EOS>
I
will
submit
even
to
what
is
unreasonable
from
my
father
,
but
I
will
not
submit
to
it
from
you
.
<EOS>
You
boast
of
your
virtues
as
if
they
purchased
you
a
right
to
be
cruel
and
unmanly
,
as
you
've
been
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
suppose
I
would
give
up
Philip
Wakem
in
obedience
to
you
.
<EOS>
The
deformity
you
insult
would
make
me
cling
to
him
and
care
for
him
the
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
;
that
is
your
view
of
things
.
"
<EOS>
said
Tom
,
more
coldly
than
ever
;
"
you
need
say
no
more
to
show
me
what
a
wide
distance
there
is
between
us
.
<EOS>
Let
us
remember
that
in
future
,
and
be
silent
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
went
back
to
St.
Ogg
's
,
to
fulfill
an
appointment
with
his
uncle
Deane
,
and
receive
directions
about
a
journey
on
which
he
was
to
set
out
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
went
up
to
her
own
room
to
pour
out
all
that
indignant
remonstrance
,
against
which
Tom
's
mind
was
close
barred
,
in
bitter
tears
.
<EOS>
Then
,
when
the
first
burst
of
unsatisfied
anger
was
gone
by
,
came
the
recollection
of
that
quiet
time
before
the
pleasure
which
had
ended
in
to
-
day
's
misery
had
perturbed
the
clearness
and
simplicity
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
She
used
to
think
in
that
time
that
she
had
made
great
conquests
,
and
won
a
lasting
stand
on
serene
heights
above
worldly
temptations
and
conflict
.
<EOS>
And
here
she
was
down
again
in
the
thick
of
a
hot
strife
with
her
own
and
others
'
passions
.
<EOS>
Life
was
not
so
short
,
then
,
and
perfect
rest
was
not
so
near
as
she
had
dreamed
when
she
was
two
years
younger
.
<EOS>
There
was
more
struggle
for
her
,
and
perhaps
more
falling
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
felt
that
she
was
entirely
wrong
,
and
that
Tom
had
been
entirely
right
,
she
could
sooner
have
recovered
more
inward
harmony
;
but
now
her
penitence
and
submission
were
constantly
obstructed
by
resentment
that
would
present
itself
to
her
<EOS>
no
otherwise
than
as
a
just
indignation
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
bled
for
Philip
;
she
went
on
recalling
the
insults
that
had
been
flung
at
him
with
so
vivid
a
conception
of
what
he
had
felt
under
them
,
that
it
was
almost
like
a
sharp
bodily
pain
to
her
,
making
her
beat
the
floor
with
her
foot
and
tighten
her
fingers
on
her
palm
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
,
how
was
it
that
she
was
now
and
then
conscious
of
a
certain
dim
background
of
relief
in
the
forced
separation
from
Philip
?
<EOS>
Surely
it
was
only
because
the
sense
of
a
deliverance
from
concealment
was
welcome
at
any
cost
.
    
<EOS>
The
Hard
-
Won
Triumph
  
<EOS>
Three
weeks
later
,
when
Dorlcote
Mill
was
at
its
prettiest
moment
in
all
the
year
,
 
the
great
chestnuts
in
blossom
,
and
the
grass
all
deep
and
daisied
,
 
<EOS>
Tom
Tulliver
came
home
to
it
earlier
than
usual
in
the
evening
,
and
as
he
passed
over
the
bridge
,
he
looked
with
the
old
deep
-
rooted
affection
at
the
respectable
red
brick
house
,
which
always
seemed
cheerful
and
inviting
outside
,
let
the
rooms
be
as
bare
and
the
hearts
as
sad
as
they
might
inside
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
very
pleasant
light
in
Tom
's
blue
-
gray
eyes
as
he
glances
at
the
house
-
windows
;
that
fold
in
his
brow
never
disappears
,
but
it
is
not
unbecoming
;
it
seems
to
imply
a
strength
of
will
that
may
possibly
be
without
harshness
,
when
the
eyes
and
mouth
have
their
gentlest
expression
.
<EOS>
His
firm
step
becomes
quicker
,
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
rebel
against
the
compression
which
is
meant
to
forbid
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
The
eyes
in
the
parlor
were
not
turned
toward
the
bridge
just
then
,
and
the
group
there
was
sitting
in
unexpectant
silence
,
 
Mr.
Tulliver
in
his
arm
-
chair
,
tired
with
a
long
ride
,
and
ruminating
with
a
worn
look
,
fixed
chiefly
on
Maggie
,
who
was
bending
over
her
sewing
while
her
mother
was
making
the
tea
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
looked
up
with
surprise
when
they
heard
the
well
-
known
foot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
's
up
now
,
Tom
?
"
said
his
father
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
bit
earlier
than
usual
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
there
was
nothing
more
for
me
to
do
,
so
I
came
away
.
<EOS>
Well
,
mother
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
went
up
to
his
mother
and
kissed
her
,
a
sign
of
unusual
good
-
humor
with
him
.
<EOS>
Hardly
a
word
or
look
had
passed
between
him
and
Maggie
in
all
the
three
weeks
;
but
his
usual
incommunicativeness
at
home
prevented
this
from
being
noticeable
to
their
parents
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
,
"
said
Tom
,
when
they
had
finished
tea
,
"
do
you
know
exactly
how
much
money
there
is
in
the
tin
box
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
a
hundred
and
ninety
-
three
pound
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
brought
less
o
'
late
;
but
young
fellows
like
to
have
their
own
way
with
their
money
.
<EOS>
Though
I
did
n't
do
as
I
liked
before
_
<EOS>
I
_
was
of
age
.
"
<EOS>
He
spoke
with
rather
timid
discontent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
quite
sure
that
's
the
sum
,
father
?
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
take
the
trouble
to
fetch
the
tin
box
down
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
perhaps
made
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
should
I
make
a
mistake
?
"
said
his
father
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
counted
it
often
enough
;
but
I
can
fetch
it
,
if
you
wo
n't
believe
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
always
an
incident
Mr.
Tulliver
liked
,
in
his
gloomy
life
,
to
fetch
the
tin
box
and
count
the
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
go
out
of
the
room
,
mother
,
"
said
Tom
,
as
he
saw
her
moving
when
his
father
was
gone
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
is
n't
Maggie
to
go
?
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
;
"
because
somebody
must
take
away
the
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
as
she
likes
,
"
said
Tom
indifferently
.
  
<EOS>
That
was
a
cutting
word
to
Maggie
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
had
leaped
with
the
sudden
conviction
that
Tom
was
going
to
tell
their
father
the
debts
could
be
paid
;
and
Tom
would
have
let
her
be
absent
when
that
news
was
told
!
<EOS>
But
she
carried
away
the
tray
and
came
back
immediately
.
<EOS>
The
feeling
of
injury
on
her
own
behalf
could
not
predominate
at
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
drew
to
the
corner
of
the
table
near
his
father
when
the
tin
box
was
set
down
and
opened
,
and
the
red
evening
light
falling
on
them
made
conspicuous
the
worn
,
sour
gloom
of
the
dark
-
eyed
father
and
the
suppressed
joy
in
the
face
of
the
fair
-
complexioned
son
.
<EOS>
The
mother
and
Maggie
sat
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
,
the
one
in
blank
patience
,
the
other
in
palpitating
expectation
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
counted
out
the
money
,
setting
it
in
order
on
the
table
,
and
then
said
,
glancing
sharply
at
Tom
:
  
"
There
now
!
<EOS>
you
see
I
was
right
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
,
looking
at
the
money
with
bitter
despondency
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
more
nor
three
hundred
wanting
;
it
'll
be
a
fine
while
before
_
I
_
can
save
that
.
<EOS>
Losing
that
forty
-
two
pound
wi
'
the
corn
was
a
sore
job
.
<EOS>
This
world
's
been
too
many
for
me
.
<EOS>
It
's
took
four
year
to
lay
_
<EOS>
this
_
<EOS>
by
<EOS>
;
it
's
much
if
I
'm
above
ground
for
another
four
year
.
<EOS>
I
must
trusten
to
you
to
pay
'
em
,
"
he
went
on
,
with
a
trembling
voice
,
"
if
you
keep
i
'
the
same
mind
now
you
're
coming
o
'
age
.
<EOS>
But
you
're
like
enough
to
bury
me
first
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
up
in
Tom
's
face
with
a
querulous
desire
for
some
assurance
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
father
,
"
said
Tom
,
speaking
with
energetic
decision
,
though
there
was
tremor
discernible
in
his
voice
too
,
"
you
will
live
to
see
the
debts
all
paid
.
<EOS>
You
shall
pay
them
with
your
own
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
tone
implied
something
more
than
mere
hopefulness
or
resolution
.
<EOS>
A
slight
electric
shock
seemed
to
pass
through
Mr.
Tulliver
,
and
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
Tom
with
a
look
of
eager
inquiry
,
while
Maggie
,
unable
to
restrain
herself
,
rushed
to
her
father
's
side
and
knelt
down
by
him
.
<EOS>
Tom
was
silent
a
little
while
before
he
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
good
while
ago
,
my
uncle
Glegg
lent
me
a
little
money
to
trade
with
,
and
that
has
answered
.
<EOS>
I
have
three
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
in
the
bank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
mother
's
arms
were
round
his
neck
as
soon
as
the
last
words
were
uttered
,
and
she
said
,
half
crying
:
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
boy
,
I
knew
you
'd
make
iverything
right
again
,
when
you
got
a
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
his
father
was
silent
;
the
flood
of
emotion
hemmed
in
all
power
of
speech
.
<EOS>
Both
Tom
and
Maggie
were
struck
with
fear
lest
the
shock
of
joy
might
even
be
fatal
.
<EOS>
But
the
blessed
relief
of
tears
came
.
<EOS>
The
broad
chest
heaved
,
the
muscles
of
the
face
gave
way
,
and
the
gray
-
haired
man
burst
into
loud
sobs
.
<EOS>
The
fit
of
weeping
gradually
subsided
,
and
he
sat
quiet
,
recovering
the
regularity
of
his
breathing
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
looked
up
at
his
wife
and
said
,
in
a
gentle
tone
:
  
<EOS>
"
Bessy
,
you
must
come
and
kiss
me
now
 
the
lad
has
made
you
amends
.
<EOS>
You
'll
see
a
bit
o
'
comfort
again
,
belike
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
she
had
kissed
him
,
and
he
had
held
her
hand
a
minute
,
his
thoughts
went
back
to
the
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
'd
brought
me
the
money
to
look
at
,
Tom
,
"
he
said
,
fingering
the
sovereigns
on
the
table
;
"
I
should
ha
'
felt
surer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
see
it
to
-
morrow
,
father
,
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
Deane
has
appointed
the
creditors
to
meet
to
-
morrow
at
the
Golden
Lion

and

a
dinner
for

at
two
o'clock

<EOS>
My

Glegg
<EOS>
and
he

It
was
advertised
in
the
"
Messenger
"
on
Saturday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
Wakem

"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
his
eye
kindling
with
triumphant
fire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
he
went
on
,
with
a
long
-
drawn
guttural
enunciation
,
taking
out
his
snuff
-
box
,
the
only
luxury
he
had
left
himself
,
and
tapping
it
with
something
of
his
old
air
of
defiance
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
get
from
under
_
<EOS>
his
_
thumb
now

though
I

<EOS>
"
Yes

said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
drawing
out
her
much
-
reduced
bunch
of
keys
,
"
there

<EOS>
"
Tom

he
said
,
in
a
stronger
voice
,
when
he
had
taken
some
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
"
you
shall
make
a

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
;
his
mind
,
which
had
so
long
been
the
home
of
nothing
but
bitter
discontent
and
foreboding
,
suddenly
filled
,
by
the
magic
of
joy
,
with
visions
of
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
But
some
subtle
influence
prevented
him
from
foreseeing
the
good
fortune
as
happening
to
himself
.

'
me
,
my
lad
,
"
he
said
,
suddenly
putting
out
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
great
thing
when
a
man
can
be
proud
as
he
's
got
a
good
son
.
<EOS>
I
've
had
_
that
_
luck
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
never
lived
to
taste
another
moment
so
delicious
as
that
;
and
Maggie
could
n't
help
forgetting
her
own
grievances
.
<EOS>
Tom
_
was
_
good
;
and
in
the
sweet
humility
that
springs
in
us
all
in
moments
of
true
admiration
and
gratitude
,
she
felt
that
the
faults
he
had
to
pardon
in
her
had
never
been
redeemed
,
as
his
faults
were
.
<EOS>
She
felt
no
jealousy
this
evening
that
,
for
the
first
time
,
she
seemed
to
be
thrown
into
the
background
in
her
father
's
mind
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
much
more
talk
before
bedtime
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
naturally
wanted
to
hear
all
the
particulars
of
Tom
's
trading
adventures
,
and
he
listened
with
growing
excitement
and
delight
.
<EOS>
He
was
curious
to
know
what
had
been
said
on
every
occasion
;
if
possible
,
what
had
been
thought
;
and
Bob
Jakin
's
part
in
the
business
threw
him
into
peculiar
outbursts
of
sympathy
with
the
triumphant
knowingness
of
that
remarkable
packman
.
<EOS>
Bob
's
juvenile
history
,
so
far
as
it
had
come
under
Mr.
Tulliver
's
knowledge
,
was
recalled
with
that
sense
of
astonishing
promise
it
displayed
,
which
is
observable
in
all
reminiscences
of
the
childhood
of
great
men
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
well
that
there
was
this
interest
of
narrative
to
keep
under
the
vague
but
fierce
sense
of
triumph
over
Wakem
,
<EOS>
which
would
otherwise
have
been
the
channel
his
joy
would
have
rushed
into
with
dangerous
force
.
<EOS>
Even
as
it
was
,
that
feeling
from
time
to
time
gave
threats
of
its
ultimate
mastery
,
in
sudden
bursts
of
irrelevant
exclamation
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
long
before
Mr.
Tulliver
got
to
sleep
that
night
;
and
the
sleep
,
when
it
came
,
was
filled
with
vivid
dreams
.
<EOS>
At
half
-
past
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
when
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
already
rising
,
he
alarmed
her
by
starting
up
with
a
sort
of
smothered
shout
,
and
looking
round
in
a
bewildered
way
at
the
walls
of
the
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
,
Mr.
Tulliver
?
"
said
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
,
still
with
a
puzzled
expression
,
and
said
at
last
:
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
dreaming
 
<EOS>
did
I
make
a
noise
?
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
'd
got
hold
of
him
.
"
    
<EOS>
A
Day
of
Reckoning
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
was
an
essentially
sober
man
,
 
able
to
take
his
glass
and
not
averse
to
it
,
but
never
exceeding
the
bounds
of
moderation
.
<EOS>
He
had
naturally
an
active
Hotspur
temperament
,
which
did
not
crave
liquid
fire
to
set
it
aglow
;
his
impetuosity
was
usually
equal
to
an
exciting
occasion
without
any
such
reinforcements
;
and
his
desire
for
the
brandy
-
and
-
water
implied
that
the
too
sudden
joy
had
fallen
with
a
dangerous
shock
on
a
frame
depressed
by
four
years
of
gloom
and
unaccustomed
hard
fare
.
<EOS>
But
that
first
doubtful
tottering
moment
passed
,
he
seemed
to
gather
strength
with
his
gathering
excitement
;
and
the
next
day
,
when
he
was
seated
at
table
with
his
creditors
,
his
eye
kindling
and
his
cheek
flushed
with
the
consciousness
that
he
was
about
to
make
an
honorable
figure
once
more
,
he
looked
more
like
the
proud
,
confident
,
warm
-
hearted
,
and
warm
-
tempered
Tulliver
of
old
times
than
might
have
seemed
possible
to
any
one
who
had
met
him
a
week
before
,
riding
along
as
had
been
his
wo
nt
for
the
last
four
years
<EOS>
since
the
sense
of
failure
and
debt
had
been
upon
him
,
 
with
his
head
hanging
down
,
casting
brief
,
unwilling
looks
on
those
who
forced
themselves
on
his
notice
.
<EOS>
He
made
his
speech
,
asserting
his
honest
principles
with
his
old
confident
eagerness
,
alluding
to
the
rascals
and
the
luck
that
had
been
against
him
,
but
that
he
had
triumphed
over
,
to
some
extent
,
by
hard
efforts
and
the
aid
of
a
good
son
;
and
winding
up
with
the
story
of
how
Tom
had
got
the
best
part
of
the
needful
money
.
<EOS>
But
the
streak
of
irritation
and
hostile
triumph
seemed
to
melt
for
a
little
while
into
purer
fatherly
pride
and
pleasure
,
when
,
Tom
's
health
having
been
proposed
,
and
uncle
Deane
having
taken
occasion
to
say
a
few
words
of
eulogy
on
his
general
character
and
conduct
,
Tom
himself
got
up
and
made
the
single
speech
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
It
could
hardly
have
been
briefer
.
<EOS>
He
thanked
the
gentlemen
for
the
honor
they
had
done
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
glad
that
he
had
been
able
to
help
his
father
in
proving
his
integrity
and
regaining
his
honest
name
;
and
,
for
his
own
part
,
he
hoped
he
should
never
undo
that
work
and
disgrace
that
name
.
<EOS>
But
the
applause
that
followed
was
so
great
,
and
Tom
looked
so
gentlemanly
as
well
as
tall
and
straight
,
that
Mr.
Tulliver
remarked
,
in
an
explanatory
manner
,
to
his
friends
on
his
right
and
left
,
that
he
had
spent
a
deal
of
money
on
his
son
's
education
.
  
<EOS>
The
party
broke
up
in
very
sober
fashion
at
five
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Tom
remained
in
St.
Ogg
's
to
attend
to
some
business
,
and
Mr.
Tulliver
mounted
his
horse
to
go
home
,
and
describe
the
memorable
things
that
had
been
said
and
done
,
to
"
poor
Bessy
and
the
little
wench
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
air
of
excitement
that
hung
about
him
was
but
faintly
due
to
good
cheer
or
any
stimulus
but
the
potent
wine
of
triumphant
joy
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
choose
any
back
street
to
-
day
,
but
rode
slowly
,
with
uplifted
head
and
free
glances
,
along
the
principal
street
all
the
way
to
the
bridge
.
  
<EOS>
Why
did
he
not
happen
to
meet
Wakem
?
<EOS>
The
want
of
that
coincidence
vexed
him
,
and
set
his
mind
at
work
in
an
irritating
way
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
Wakem
was
gone
out
of
town
to
-
day
on
purpose
to
avoid
seeing
or
hearing
anything
of
an
honorable
action
which
might
well
cause
him
some
unpleasant
twinges
.
<EOS>
If
Wakem
were
to
meet
him
then
,
Mr.
Tulliver
would
look
straight
at
him
,
and
the
rascal
would
perhaps
be
forsaken
a
little
by
his
cool
,
domineering
impudence
.
<EOS>
He
would
know
by
and
by
that
an
honest
man
was
not
going
to
serve
_
him
<EOS>
_
any
longer
,
and
lend
his
honesty
to
fill
a
pocket
already
over
-
full
of
dishonest
gains
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
luck
was
beginning
to
turn
;
perhaps
the
Devil
did
n't
always
hold
the
best
cards
in
this
world
.
  
<EOS>
Simmering
in
this
way
,
Mr.
Tulliver
approached
the
yardgates
of
Dorlcote
Mill
,
near
enough
to
see
a
well
-
known
figure
coming
out
of
them
on
a
fine
black
horse
.
<EOS>
They
met
about
fifty
yards
from
the
gates
,
between
the
great
chestnuts
and
elms
and
the
high
bank
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tulliver
,
"
said
Wakem
,
abruptly
,
in
a
haughtier
tone
than
usual
,
"
what
a
fool
's
trick
you
did
,
 
spreading
those
hard
lumps
on
that
Far
Close
!
<EOS>
I
told
you
how
it
would
be
;
but
you
men
never
learn
to
farm
with
any
method
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
said
<EOS>
Tulliver
,
suddenly
boiling
up
;
"
get
somebody
else
to
farm
for
you
,
then
,
as'll
ask
_
you
_
to
teach
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
drinking
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Wakem
,
really
believing
that
this
was
the
meaning
of
Tulliver
's
flushed
face
and
sparkling
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
've
not
been
drinking
,
"
said
Tulliver
;
"
I
want
no
drinking
to
help
me
make
up
my
mind
as
I
'll
serve
no
longer
under
a
scoundrel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
!
<EOS>
you
may
leave
my
premises
to
-
morrow
,
then
;
hold
your
insolent
tongue
and
let
me
pass
.
"
<EOS>
(
Tulliver
was
backing
his
horse
across
the
road
to
hem
Wakem
in
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
_
sha'n"t
<EOS>
_
let
you
pass
,
"
said
Tulliver
,
getting
fiercer
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
tell
you
what
I
think
of
you
first
.
<EOS>
You
're
too
big
a
raskill
to
get
hanged
 
<EOS>
you
're
   
<EOS>
"
  
"
Let
me
pass
,
you
ignorant
brute
,
or
I
'll
ride
over
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
,
spurring
his
horse
and
raising
his
whip
,
made
a
rush
forward
;
and
Wakem
's
horse
,
rearing
and
staggering
backward
,
threw
his
rider
from
the
saddle
and
sent
him
sideways
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Wakem
had
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
loose
the
bridle
at
once
,
and
as
the
horse
only
staggered
a
few
paces
and
then
stood
still
,
he
might
have
risen
and
remounted
without
more
inconvenience
than
a
bruise
and
a
shake
.
<EOS>
But
before
he
could
rise
,
Tulliver
was
off
his
horse
too
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
the
long
-
hated
predominant
man
down
,
and
in
his
power
,
threw
him
into
a
frenzy
of
triumphant
vengeance
,
which
seemed
to
give
him
preternatural
agility
and
strength
.
<EOS>
He
rushed
on
Wakem
,
who
was
in
the
act
of
trying
to
recover
his
feet
,
grasped
him
by
the
left
arm
so
as
to
press
Wakem
's
whole
weight
on
the
right
arm
,
which
rested
on
the
ground
,
and
flogged
him
fiercely
across
the
back
with
his
riding
-
whip
.
<EOS>
Wakem
shouted
for
help
,
but
no
help
came
,
until
a
woman
's
scream
was
heard
,
and
the
cry
of
"
Father
,
father
!
"
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
Wakem
felt
,
something
had
arrested
Mr.
Tulliver
's
arm
;
for
the
flogging
ceased
,
and
the
grasp
on
his
own
arm
was
relaxed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Get
away
with
you
 
go
!
"
<EOS>
said
Tulliver
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
to
Wakem
that
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
Slowly
the
lawyer
rose
,
and
,
as
he
turned
his
head
,
saw
that
Tulliver
's
arms
were
being
held
by
a
girl
,
rather
by
the
fear
of
hurting
the
girl
that
clung
to
him
with
all
her
young
might
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Luke
 
mother
 
come
and
help
Mr.
Wakem
!
"
<EOS>
Maggie
cried
,
as
she
heard
the
longed
-
for
footsteps
.
  
<EOS>
"
Help
me
on
to
that
low
horse
,
"
said
Wakem
to
Luke
,
"
then
I
shall
perhaps
manage
;
though
 
confound
it
 
<EOS>
I
think
this
arm
is
sprained
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
some
difficulty
,
Wakem
was
heaved
on
to
Tulliver
's
horse
.
<EOS>
Then
he
turned
toward
the
miller
and
said
,
with
white
rage
,
"
You
'll
suffer
for
this
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Your
daughter
is
a
witness
that
you
've
assaulted
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
,
"
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
in
a
thick
,
fierce
voice
;
"
go
and
show
your
back
,
and
tell
'em
I
thrashed
you
.
<EOS>
Tell
'em
I
've
made
things
a
bit
more
even
i
'
the
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ride
my
horse
home
with
me
,
"
said
Wakem
to
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
By
the
Tofton
Ferry
,
not
through
the
town
.
"
  
"
Father
,
come
in
!
"
<EOS>
said
Maggie
,
imploringly
.
<EOS>
Then
,
seeing
that
Wakem
had
ridden
off
,
and
that
no
further
violence
was
possible
,
she
slackened
her
hold
and
burst
into
hysteric
sobs
,
while
poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
stood
by
in
silence
,
quivering
with
fear
.
<EOS>
But
Maggie
became
conscious
that
as
she
was
slackening
her
hold
her
father
was
beginning
to
grasp
her
and
lean
on
her
.
<EOS>
The
surprise
checked
her
sobs
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
ill
 
faintish
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Help
me
in
,
Bessy
 
<EOS>
I
'm
giddy
 
<EOS>
I
've
a
pain
<EOS>
i
'
the
head
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
walked
in
slowly
,
propped
by
his
wife
and
daughter
and
tottered
into
his
arm
-
chair
.
<EOS>
The
almost
purple
flush
had
given
way
to
paleness
,
and
his
hand
was
cold
.
  
<EOS>
"
Had
n't
we
better
send
for
the
doctor
?
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
  
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
too
faint
and
suffering
to
hear
her
;
but
presently
,
when
she
said
to
Maggie
,
"
Go
and
seek
for
somebody
to
fetch
the
doctor
,
"
he
looked
up
at
her
with
full
comprehension
,
and
said
,
"
Doctor
?
<EOS>
No
 
<EOS>
no
doctor
.
<EOS>
It
's
my
head
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
Help
me
to
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sad
ending
to
the
day
that
had
risen
on
them
all
like
a
beginning
of
better
times
!
<EOS>
But
mingled
seed
must
bear
a
mingled
crop
.
  
<EOS>
In
half
an
hour
after
his
father
had
lain
down
Tom
came
home
.
<EOS>
Bob
Jakin
was
with
him
,
come
to
congratulate
"
the
old
master
,
"
not
without
some
excusable
pride
that
he
had
had
his
share
in
bringing
about
Mr.
Tom
's
good
luck
;
and
Tom
had
thought
his
father
would
like
nothing
better
,
as
a
finish
to
the
day
,
than
a
talk
with
Bob
.
<EOS>
But
now
Tom
could
only
spend
the
evening
in
gloomy
expectation
of
the
unpleasant
consequences
that
must
follow
on
this
mad
outbreak
of
his
father
's
long
-
smothered
hate
.
<EOS>
After
the
painful
news
had
been
told
,
he
sat
in
silence
;
he
had
not
spirit
or
inclination
to
tell
his
mother
and
sister
anything
about
the
dinner
;
they
hardly
cared
to
ask
it
.
<EOS>
Apparently
the
mingled
thread
in
the
web
of
their
life
was
so
curiously
twisted
together
that
there
could
be
no
joy
without
a
sorrow
coming
close
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Tom
was
dejected
by
the
thought
that
his
exemplary
effort
must
always
be
baffled
by
the
wrong
-
doing
of
others
;
Maggie
was
living
through
,
over
and
over
again
,
the
agony
of
the
moment
in
which
she
had
rushed
to
throw
herself
on
her
father
's
arm
,
with
a
vague
,
shuddering
foreboding
of
wretched
scenes
to
come
.
<EOS>
Not
one
of
the
three
felt
any
particular
alarm
about
Mr.
Tulliver
's
health
;
the
symptoms
did
not
recall
his
former
dangerous
attack
,
and
it
seemed
only
a
necessary
consequence
that
his
violent
passion
and
effort
of
strength
,
after
many
hours
of
unusual
excitement
,
should
have
made
him
feel
ill
.
<EOS>
Rest
would
probably
cure
him
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
,
tired
out
by
his
active
day
,
fell
asleep
soon
,
and
slept
soundly
;
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
had
only
just
come
to
bed
,
when
he
waked
to
see
his
mother
standing
by
him
in
the
gray
light
of
early
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
boy
,
you
must
get
up
this
minute
;
I
've
sent
for
the
doctor
,
and
your
father
wants
you
and
Maggie
to
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
worse
,
mother
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
been
very
ill
all
night
with
his
head
,
but
he
does
n't
say
it
's
worse
;
he
only
said
suddenly
,
"
Bessy
,
fetch
the
boy
and
girl
.
<EOS>
Tell
'em
to
make
haste
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Maggie
and
Tom
threw
on
their
clothes
hastily
in
the
chill
gray
light
,
and
reached
their
father
's
room
almost
at
the
same
moment
.
<EOS>
He
was
watching
for
them
with
an
expression
of
pain
on
his
brow
,
but
with
sharpened
,
anxious
consciousness
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
frightened
and
trembling
,
looking
worn
and
aged
from
disturbed
rest
.
<EOS>
Maggie
was
at
the
bedside
first
,
but
her
father
's
glance
was
toward
Tom
,
who
came
and
stood
next
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
my
lad
,
it
's
come
upon
me
as
I
sha'n"t
get
up
again
.
<EOS>
This
world
's
been
too
many
for
me
,
my
lad
,
but
you
've
done
what
you
could
to
make
things
a
bit
even
.
<EOS>
Shake
hands
wi
'
me
again
,
my
lad
,
before
I
go
away
from
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
father
and
son
clasped
hands
and
looked
at
each
other
an
instant
.
<EOS>
Then
Tom
said
,
trying
to
speak
firmly
<EOS>
,
    
"
Have
you
any
wish
,
father
 
<EOS>
that
I
can
fulfil
,
when
   
"
  
"
Ay
,
my
lad
 
<EOS>
you
'll
try
and
get
the
old
mill
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
there
's
your
mother
 
<EOS>
you
'll
try
and
make
her
amends
,
all
you
can
,
for
my
bad
luck
 
<EOS>
and
there
's
the
little
wench
   
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
father
turned
his
eyes
on
Maggie
with
a
still
more
eager
look
,
while
she
,
with
a
bursting
heart
,
sank
on
her
knees
,
to
be
closer
to
the
dear
,
time
-
worn
face
which
had
been
present
with
her
through
long
years
,
as
the
sign
of
her
deepest
love
and
hardest
trial
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
take
care
of
her
,
<EOS>
Tom
 
do
n't
you
fret
,
<EOS>
my
wench
 
<EOS>
there
'll
come
somebody
as'll
love
you
and
take
your
part
 
<EOS>
and
you
must
be
good
to
her
,
<EOS>
my
lad
.
<EOS>
I
was
good
to
_
my
_
sister
.
<EOS>
Kiss
me
,
Maggie
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
Bessy
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
manage
to
pay
for
a
brick
grave
,
Tom
,
so
as
your
mother
and
me
can
lie
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
away
from
them
all
when
he
had
said
this
,
and
lay
silent
for
some
minutes
,
while
they
stood
watching
him
,
not
daring
to
move
.
<EOS>
The
morning
light
was
growing
clearer
for
them
,
and
they
could
see
the
heaviness
gathering
in
his
face
,
and
the
dulness
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
But
at
last
he
looked
toward
Tom
and
said
,
    
"
I
had
my
turn
 
<EOS>
I
beat
him
.
<EOS>
That
was
nothing
but
fair
.
<EOS>
I
never
wanted
anything
<EOS>
but
what
was
fair
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
,
father
,
dear
father
,
"
said
Maggie
,
an
unspeakable
anxiety
predominating
over
her
grief
,
"
you
forgive
him
 
<EOS>
you
forgive
every
one
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
move
his
eyes
to
look
at
her
,
but
he
said
,
    
"
No
,
my
wench
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
forgive
him
.
<EOS>
What
's
forgiving
to
do
?
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
love
a
raskill
   
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
voice
had
become
thicker
;
but
he
wanted
to
say
more
,
and
moved
his
lips
again
and
again
,
struggling
in
vain
to
speak
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
words
forced
their
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
God
forgive
raskills
?
 
<EOS>
but
if
He
does
,
He
wo
n't
be
hard
wi
'
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
hands
moved
uneasily
,
as
if
he
wanted
them
to
remove
some
obstruction
that
weighed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Two
or
three
times
there
fell
from
him
some
broken
words
,
    
"
This
world
's
 
too
many
 
honest
man
 
puzzling
   
"
  
<EOS>
Soon
they
merged
into
mere
mutterings
;
the
eyes
had
ceased
to
discern
;
and
then
came
the
final
silence
.
  
<EOS>
But
not
of
death
.
<EOS>
For
an
hour
or
more
the
chest
heaved
,
the
loud
,
hard
breathing
continued
,
getting
gradually
slower
,
as
the
cold
dews
gathered
on
the
brow
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
there
was
total
stillness
,
and
poor
Tulliver
's
dimly
lighted
soul
had
forever
ceased
to
be
vexed
with
the
painful
riddle
of
this
world
.
  
<EOS>
Help
was
come
now
;
Luke
and
his
wife
were
there
,
and
Mr.
Turnbull
had
arrived
,
too
late
for
everything
but
to
say
,
"
This
is
death
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
and
Maggie
went
downstairs
together
into
the
room
where
their
father
's
place
was
empty
.
<EOS>
Their
eyes
turned
to
the
same
spot
,
and
Maggie
spoke
,
    
"
Tom
,
forgive
me
 
let
us
always
love
each
other
"
;
and
they
clung
and
wept
together

The
well

furnished

,
with
the
open
grand
piano
,
and
the
pleasant
outlook
down
a
sloping
garden
to
a
boat

house
by
the
side
of

is
Mr.

.
<EOS>
The
neat
little
lady
in
mourning
,
whose
light
-
brown
ringlets
are
falling
over
the
colored
embroidery
with
which
her
fingers
are
busy
,
is
of
course
Lucy
Deane
;
and
the
fine
young
man
who
is
leaning
down
from
his
chair
to
snap
the
scissors
in
the
extremely
abbreviated
face
of
the
"
King
Charles
"
lying
on
the
young
lady
's
feet
is
no
other
than
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
,
whose
diamond
ring
,
attar
of
roses
,
and
air
of
_
nonchalant
_
leisure
,
at
twelve
o'clock
in
the
day
,
are
the
graceful
and
odoriferous
result
of
the
largest
oil
-
mill
and
the
most
extensive
wharf
in
St.
Ogg
's
.
<EOS>
There
is
an
apparent
triviality
in
the
action
with
the
scissors
,
but
your
discernment
perceives
at
once
that
there
is
a
design
in
it
which
makes
it
eminently
worthy
of
a
large
-
headed
,
long
-
limbed
young
man
;
for
you
see
that
Lucy
wants
the
scissors
,
and
is
compelled
,
reluctant
as
she
may
be
,
to
shake
her
ringlets
back
,
raise
her
soft
hazel
eyes
,
smile
playfully
down
on
the
face
that
is
so
very
nearly
on
a
level
with
her
knee
,
and
holding
out
her
little
shell
-
pink
palm
,
to
say
,
    
<EOS>
"
My
scissors
,
please
,
if
you
can
renounce
the
great
pleasure
of
persecuting
my
poor
Minny
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
foolish
scissors
have
slipped
too
far
over
the
knuckles
,
it
seems
,
and
Hercules
holds
out
his
entrapped
fingers
hopelessly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Confound
the
scissors
!
<EOS>
The
oval
lies
the
wrong
way
.
<EOS>
Please
draw
them
off
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Draw
them
off
with
your
other
hand

"
says
Miss
Lucy
,
roguishly
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
that
's
my
left
hand
;
I
'm
not
left
-
handed
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
laughs
,
and
the
scissors
are
drawn
off
with
gentle
touches
from
tiny
tips
,
which
naturally
dispose
Mr.
Stephen
for
a
repetition
_
da
capo
_
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
watches
for
the
release
of
the
scissors
,
that
he
may
get
them
into
his
possession
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Lucy
,
sticking
them
in
her
band
<EOS>
,
"
you
shall
not
have
my
scissors
again
,
 
you
have
strained
them
already

<EOS>
Now
do

set
Minny
growling
again

<EOS>
Sit
up
and
behave
properly
,
and
then
I
will
tell
you
some
news

"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
?
"
said
Stephen
,
throwing
himself
back
and
hanging
his
right
arm
over
the
corner
of
his
chair
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
been
sitting
for
his
portrait
,
which
would
have
represented
a
rather
striking
young
man
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
with
a
square
forehead
,
short
dark
-
brown
hair
,
standing
erect
,
with
a
slight
wave
at
the
end
,
like
a
thick
crop
of
corn
,
and
a
half
-
ardent
,
half
-
sarcastic
glance
from
under
his
well
-
marked
horizontal
eyebrows
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
very
important
news
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
very
.
<EOS>
Guess

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
going

change
Minny

give
him
three
ratafias

spoonful
of
cream

<EOS>
"
Quite

"
  
<EOS>
"
Well

then
,
Dr.
Kenn

been
preaching
against
buckram

and
you

have
all
been
sending
him
a
roundrobin
,
saying
,
"
This

a
hard
doctrine

who
can
bear
it

"
<EOS>
"
  
"
For
shame

said
Lucy
,
adjusting
her
little
mouth
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
rather
dull
of
you
not
to
guess
my
news
,
because
it
is
about
something
I
mentioned
to
you
not
very
long
ago
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
mentioned
many
things
to
me
not
long
ago
.
<EOS>
Does
your
feminine
tyranny
require
that
when
you
say
the
thing
you
mean
is
one
of
several
things
,
I
should
know
it
immediately
by
that
mark

"
<EOS>
Yes

I

And
my
silliness

part

"
I
did
n't
say

Philip
Wakem
betrayed
you

he
said
so
one
day
when
you
were
not
here

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh

I
know
Phil
is
fierce

he
makes
it
quite
a

I
think
he
must
be
love

sick

some

some
exalted
Beatrice

he
met
abroad

"
By

by

said
Lucy

pausing
in

"
it

just
occurred
to
me

I
never

object

as
her
brother
does

<EOS>
Tom
will
not
enter
a
room
where
Philip
is

if
he
knows
it
;
perhaps
Maggie
may
be
the

,
and
then
we
sha'n"t
be
able
to
sing
our

shall
we

"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
is
your
cousin
coming
to
stay
with
you
?
"
said
Stephen
,
with
a
look
of
slight
annoyance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
that
was
my
news
,
which
you
have
forgotten
.
<EOS>
She
's
going
to
leave
her
situation
,
where
she
has
been
nearly
two
years
,
poor
thing
,
 
ever
since
her
father
's
death

and
she
will
stay
with
me
a
month
or
two
,
 
many
months
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
am
I
bound
to
be
pleased
at
that
news
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
no
,
not
at
all
,
"
said
Lucy
,
with
a
little
air
of
pique
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
am
pleased
,
but
that
,
of
course
,
is
no
reason
why
_
you
_
should
be
pleased
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
girl
in
the
world
I
love
so
well
as
my

Maggie

"
And
you
will
be
inseparable

suppose

comes

will
be
no
possibility
of
a
_

with
you
any
more

can
find

for
her

will
pair
off
with
her
occasionally

What
is
the
ground
of
dislike
to
Philip
?
<EOS>
He
might
have
been
a
resource
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
family
quarrel
with
Philip
's
father
.
<EOS>
There
were
very
painful
circumstances
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
I
never
quite
understood
them
,
or
knew
them
all

<EOS>
My
uncle
Tulliver
was
unfortunate
and
lost
all
his
property
,
and
I
think
he
considered
Mr.
Wakem
was
somehow
the
cause
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wakem
bought
Dorlcote
Mill
,
my
uncle
's
old
place
,
where
he
always
lived
.
<EOS>
You
must
remember
my
uncle
Tulliver
,
do
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Stephen
,
with
rather
supercilious
indifference
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
always
known
the
name
,
and
I
dare
say
I
knew
the
man
by
sight

apart
from

name
.
<EOS>
I
know
half
the
names
and
faces
in
the
neighborhood

disjointed

He

tempered
man

remember

when
I

a
little

used
to
go

see
my
cousins
,
he
often
frightened
me
by
talking
as
if
he
were
angry
.
<EOS>
Papa
told
me
there
was
a
dreadful
quarrel
,
the
very
day
before
my
uncle
's
death
,
between
him
and
Mr.
Wakem
,
but
it
was
hushed
up
.
<EOS>
That
was
when
you
were
in
London
.
<EOS>
Papa
says
my
uncle
was
quite
mistaken
in
many
ways
;
his
mind
had
become
embittered
.
<EOS>
But
Tom
and
Maggie
must
naturally
feel
it
very
painful
to
be
reminded
of
these
things
.
<EOS>
They
have
had
so
much
,
so
very
much
trouble
.
<EOS>
Maggie
was
at
school
with
me
six
years
ago
,
when
she
was
fetched
away
because
of
her
father
's
misfortunes
,
and
she
has
hardly
had
any
pleasure
since
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
in
a
dreary
situation
in
a
school
since
uncle
's
death
,
because
she
is
determined
to
be
independent
,
and
not
live
with
aunt
Pullet
;
and
I
could
hardly
wish
her
to
come
to
me
then
,
because
dear
mamma
was
ill
,
and
everything
was
so
sad
.
<EOS>
That
is
why
I
want
her
to
come
to
me
now
,
and
have
a
long
,
long
holiday
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
sweet
and
angelic
of
you
,
"
said
Stephen
,
looking
at
her
with
an
admiring
smile
;
"
and
all
the
more
so
if
she
has
the
conversational
qualities
of
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
aunty
!
<EOS>
You
are
cruel
to
ridicule
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
very
valuable
to
_
me
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
She
manages
the
house
beautifully
,
 
much
better
than
any
stranger
would
,
 
and
she
was
a
great
comfort
to
me
in
mamma
's
illness
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
in
point
of
companionship
one
would
prefer
that
she
should
be
represented
by
her
brandy
-
cherries
and
cream
-
cakes
.
<EOS>
I
think
with
a
shudder
that
her
daughter
will
always
be
present
in
person
,
and
have
no
agreeable
proxies
of
that
kind
,
 
a
fat
,
blond
girl
,
with
round
blue
eyes
,
who
will
stare
at
us
silently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
!
"
exclaimed
Lucy
,
laughing
wickedly
,
and
clapping
her
hands
,
"
that
is
just
my
cousin
Maggie
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
seen
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
;
I
'm
only
guessing
what
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
daughter
must
be
;
and
then
if
she
is
to
banish
Philip
,
our
only
apology
for
a
tenor
,
that
will
be
an
additional
bore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
hope
that
may
not
be
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
will
ask
you
to
call
on
Philip
and
tell
him
Maggie
is
coming
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
is
quite
aware
of
Tom
's
feeling
,
and
always
keeps
out
of
his
way
;
so
he
will
understand
,
if
you
tell
him
,
that
I
asked
you
to
warn
him
not
to
come
until
I
write
to
ask
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
had
better
write
a
pretty
note
for
me
to
take
;
Phil
is
so
sensitive
,
you
know
,
the
least
thing
might
frighten
him
off
coming
at
all
,
and
we
had
hard
work
to
get
him
.
<EOS>
I
can
never
induce
him
to
come
to
the
park
;
he
does
n't
like
my
sisters
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
your
faëry
touch
that
can
lay
his
ruffled
feathers
.
"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
mastered
the
little
hand
that
was
straying
toward
the
table
,
and
touched
it
lightly
with
his
lips
.
<EOS>
Little
Lucy
felt
very
proud
and
happy
.
<EOS>
She
and
Stephen
were
in
that
stage
of
courtship
which
makes
the
most
exquisite
moment
of
youth
,
the
freshest
blossom
-
time
of
passion
,
 
when
each
is
sure
of
the
other
's
love
,
but
no
formal
declaration
has
been
made
,
and
all
is
mutual
divination
,
exalting
the
most
trivial
word
,
the
lightest
gesture
,
into
thrills
delicate
and
delicious
as
wafted
jasmine
scent
.
<EOS>
The
explicitness
of
an
engagement
wears
off
this
finest
edge
of
susceptibility
;
it
is
jasmine
gathered
and
presented
in
a
large
bouquet
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
really
odd
that
you
should
have
hit
so
exactly
on
Maggie
's
appearance
and
manners
,
"
said
the
cunning
Lucy
,
moving
to
reach
her
desk
,
"
because
she
might
have
been
like
her
brother
,
you
know
;
and
Tom
has
not
round
eyes
;
and
he
is
as
far
as
possible
from
staring
at
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
suppose
he
is
like
the
father
;
he
seems
to
be
as
proud
as
Lucifer
.
<EOS>
Not
a
brilliant
companion
,
though
,
I
should
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
Tom
.
<EOS>
He
gave
me
my
Minny
when
I
lost
Lolo
;
and
papa
is
very
fond
of
him
:
he
says
Tom
has
excellent
principles
.
<EOS>
It
was
through
him
that
his
father
was
able
to
pay
all
his
debts
before
he
died
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
ah
;
I
've
heard
about
that
.
<EOS>
I
heard
your
father
and
mine
talking
about
it
a
little
while
ago
,
after
dinner
,
in
one
of
their
interminable
discussions
about
business
.
<EOS>
They
think
of
doing
something
for
young
Tulliver
;
he
saved
them
from
a
considerable
loss
by
riding
home
in
some
marvellous
way
,
like
Turpin
,
to
bring
them
news
about
the
stoppage
of
a
bank
,
or
something
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
rather
drowsy
at
the
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
rose
from
his
seat
,
and
sauntered
to
the
piano
,
humming
in
falsetto
,
"
Graceful
Consort
,
"
as
he
turned
over
the
volume
of
"
The
Creation
,
"
which
stood
open
on
the
desk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
and
sing
this
,
"
he
said
,
when
he
saw
Lucy
rising
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
"
Graceful
Consort
"
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
it
suits
your
voice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
;
it
exactly
suits
my
feeling
,
which
,
Philip
will
have
it
,
is
the
grand
element
of
good
singing
.
<EOS>
I
notice
men
with
indifferent
voices
are
usually
of
that
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Philip
burst
into
one
of
his
invectives
against
"
The
Creation
"
the
other
day
,
"
said
Lucy
,
seating
herself
at
the
piano
.
"
<EOS>
He
says
it
has
a
sort
of
sugared
complacency
and
flattering
make
-
believe
in
it
,
as
if
it
were
written
for
the
birthday
_
fête
_
of
a
German
Grand
-
Duke
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
pooh
!
<EOS>
He
is
the
fallen
Adam
with
a
soured
temper
.
<EOS>
We
are
Adam
and
Eve
unfallen
,
in
Paradise
.
<EOS>
Now
,
then
,
 
the
recitative
,
for
the
sake
of
the
moral
.
<EOS>
You
will
sing
the
whole
duty
of
woman
,
 
"
And
from
obedience
grows
my
pride
and
happiness
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
no
,
I
shall
not
respect
an
Adam
who
drags
the
_
tempo
_
,
as
you
will
,
"
said
Lucy
,
beginning
to
play
the
duet
.
  
<EOS>
Surely
the
only
courtship
unshaken
by
doubts
and
fears
must
be
that
in
which
the
lovers
can
sing
together
.
<EOS>
The
sense
of
mutual
fitness
that
springs
from
the
two
deep
notes
fulfilling
expectation
just
at
the
right
moment
between
the
notes
of
the
silvery
soprano
,
from
the
perfect
accord
of
descending
thirds
and
fifths
,
from
the
preconcerted
loving
chase
of
a
fugue
,
is
likely
enough
to
supersede
any
immediate
demand
for
less
impassioned
forms
of
agreement
.
<EOS>
The
contralto
will
not
care
to
catechise
the
bass
;
the
tenor
will
foresee
no
embarrassing
dearth
of
remark
in
evenings
spent
with
the
lovely
soprano
.
<EOS>
In
the
provinces
,
too
,
where
music
was
so
scarce
in
that
remote
time
,
how
could
the
musical
people
avoid
falling
in
love
with
each
other
?
<EOS>
Even
political
principle
must
have
been
in
danger
of
relaxation
under
such
circumstances
;
and
the
violin
,
faithful
to
rotten
boroughs
,
must
have
been
tempted
to
fraternize
in
a
demoralizing
way
with
a
reforming
violoncello
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
the
linnet
-
throated
soprano
and
the
full
-
toned
bass
singing
,
      
"
With
thee
delight
is
ever
new
,
  
With
thee
is
life
incessant
bliss
,
"
  
believed
what
they
sang
all
the
more
_
because
_
they
sang
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
for
Raphael
's
great
song
,
"
said
Lucy
,
when
they
had
finished
the
duet
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
the
"
heavy
beasts
"
to
perfection
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
sounds
complimentary
,
"
said
Stephen
,
looking
at
his
watch
.
<EOS>
"
By
Jove
,
it
's
nearly
half
-
past
one
!
<EOS>
Well
,
I
can
just
sing
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
delivered
with
admirable
ease
the
deep
notes
representing
the
tread
of
the
heavy
beasts
;
but
when
a
singer
has
an
audience
of
two
,
there
is
room
for
divided
sentiments
.
<EOS>
Minny
's
mistress
was
charmed
;
but
Minny
,
who
had
intrenched
himself
,
trembling
,
in
his
basket
as
soon
as
the
music
began
,
found
this
thunder
so
little
to
his
taste
that
he
leaped
out
and
scampered
under
the
remotest
_
chiffonnier
_
,
as
the
most
eligible
place
in
which
a
small
dog
could
await
the
crack
of
doom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Adieu
,
"
graceful
consort
,
"
"
said
Stephen
,
buttoning
his
coat
across
when
he
had
done
singing
,
and
smiling
down
from
his
tall
height
,
with
the
air
of
rather
a
patronizing
lover
,
at
the
little
lady
on
the
music
-
stool
.
<EOS>
"
My
bliss
is
not
incessant
,
for
I
must
gallop
home
.
<EOS>
I
promised
to
be
there
at
lunch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
be
able
to
call
on
Philip
,
then
?
<EOS>
It
is
of
no
consequence
;
I
have
said
everything
in
my
note
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
engaged
with
your
cousin
to
-
morrow
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
we
are
going
to
have
a
little
family
-
party
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
Tom
will
dine
with
us
;
and
poor
aunty
will
have
her
two
children
together
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
very
pretty
;
I
think
a
great
deal
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
may
come
the
next
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
!
<EOS>
Come
and
be
introduced
to
my
cousin
Maggie
;
though
you
can
hardly
be
said
not
to
have
seen
her
,
you
have
described
her
so
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
then
.
"
<EOS>
And
there
was
that
slight
pressure
of
the
hands
,
and
momentary
meeting
of
the
eyes
,
which
will
often
leave
a
little
lady
with
a
slight
flush
and
smile
on
her
face
that
do
not
subside
immediately
when
the
door
is
closed
,
and
with
an
inclination
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
rather
than
to
seat
herself
quietly
at
her
embroidery
,
or
other
rational
and
improving
occupation
.
<EOS>
At
least
this
was
the
effect
on
Lucy
;
and
you
will
not
,
I
hope
,
consider
it
an
indication
of
vanity
predominating
over
more
tender
impulses
,
that
she
just
glanced
in
the
chimney
-
glass
as
her
walk
brought
her
near
it
.
<EOS>
The
desire
to
know
that
one
has
not
looked
an
absolute
fright
during
a
few
hours
of
conversation
may
be
construed
as
lying
within
the
bounds
of
a
laudable
benevolent
consideration
for
others
.
<EOS>
And
Lucy
had
so
much
of
this
benevolence
in
her
nature
that
I
am
inclined
to
think
her
small
egoisms
were
impregnated
with
it
,
just
as
there
are
people
not
altogether
unknown
to
you
whose
small
benevolences
have
a
predominant
and
somewhat
rank
odor
of
egoism
.
<EOS>
Even
now
,
that
she
is
walking
up
and
down
with
a
little
triumphant
flutter
of
her
girlish
heart
at
the
sense
that
she
is
loved
by
the
person
of
chief
consequence
in
her
small
world
,
you
may
see
in
her
hazel
eyes
an
ever
-
present
sunny
benignity
,
in
which
the
momentary
harmless
flashes
of
personal
vanity
are
quite
lost
;
and
if
she
is
happy
in
thinking
of
her
lover
,
it
is
because
the
thought
of
him
mingles
readily
with
all
the
gentle
affections
and
good
-
natured
offices
with
which
she
fills
her
peaceful
days
.
<EOS>
Even
now
,
her
mind
,
with
that
instantaneous
alternation
which
makes
two
currents
of
feeling
or
imagination
seem
simultaneous
,
is
glancing
continually
from
Stephen
to
the
preparations
she
has
only
half
finished
in
Maggie
's
room
.
<EOS>
Cousin
Maggie
should
be
treated
as
well
as
the
grandest
lady
-
visitor
,
 
nay
,
better
,
for
she
should
have
Lucy
's
best
prints
and
drawings
in
her
bedroom
,
and
the
very
finest
bouquet
of
spring
flowers
on
her
table
.
<EOS>
Maggie
would
enjoy
all
that
,
she
was
so
found
of
pretty
things
!
<EOS>
And
there
was
poor
aunt
Tulliver
,
that
no
one
made
any
account
of
<EOS>
,
she
was
to
be
surprised
with
the
present
of
a
cap
of
superlative
quality
,
and
to
have
her
health
drunk
in
a
gratifying
manner
,
for
which
Lucy
was
going
to
lay
a
plot
with
her
father
this
evening
.
<EOS>
Clearly
,
she
had
not
time
to
indulge
in
long
reveries
about
her
own
happy
love
-
affairs
.
<EOS>
With
this
thought
she
walked
toward
the
door
,
but
paused
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
,
then
,
Minny
?
"
she
said
,
stooping
in
answer
to
some
whimpering
of
that
small
quadruped
,
and
lifting
his
glossy
head
against
her
pink
cheek
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
think
I
was
going
without
you
?
<EOS>
Come
,
then
,
let
us
go
and
see
Sinbad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sinbad
was
Lucy
's
chestnut
horse
,
that
she
always
fed
with
her
own
hand
when
he
was
turned
out
in
the
paddock
.
<EOS>
She
was
fond
of
feeding
dependent
creatures
,
and
knew
the
private
tastes
of
all
the
animals
about
the
house
,
delighting
in
the
little
rippling
sounds
of
her
canaries
when
their
beaks
were
busy
with
fresh
seed
,
and
in
the
small
nibbling
pleasures
of
certain
animals
which
,
lest
she
should
appear
too
trivial
,
I
will
here
call
"
the
more
familiar
rodents
.
<EOS>
"
  
Was
not
Stephen
Guest
right
in
his
decided
opinion
that
this
slim
maiden
of
eighteen
was
quite
the
sort
of
wife
a
man
would
not
be
likely
to
repent
of
marrying
,
 
a
woman
who
was
loving
and
thoughtful
for
other
women
,
not
giving
them
Judas
-
kisses
with
eyes
askance
on
their
welcome
defects
,
but
with
real
care
and
vision
for
their
half
-
hidden
pains
and
mortifications
,
with
long
ruminating
enjoyment
of
little
pleasures
prepared
for
them
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
emphasis
of
his
admiration
did
not
fall
precisely
on
this
rarest
quality
in
her
;
perhaps
he
approved
his
own
choice
of
her
chiefly
because
she
did
not
strike
him
as
a
remarkable
rarity
.
<EOS>
A
man
likes
his
wife
to
be
pretty
;
well
,
Lucy
was
pretty
,
but
not
to
a
maddening
extent
.
<EOS>
A
man
likes
his
wife
to
be
accomplished
,
gentle
,
affectionate
,
and
not
stupid
;
and
Lucy
had
all
these
qualifications
.
<EOS>
Stephen
was
not
surprised
to
find
himself
in
love
with
her
,
and
was
conscious
of
excellent
judgment
in
preferring
her
to
Miss
Leyburn
,
the
daughter
of
the
county
member
,
although
Lucy
was
only
the
daughter
of
his
father
's
subordinate
partner
;
besides
,
he
had
had
to
defy
and
overcome
a
slight
unwillingness
and
disappointment
in
his
father
and
sisters
,
 
a
circumstance
which
gives
a
young
man
an
agreeable
consciousness
of
his
own
dignity
.
<EOS>
Stephen
was
aware
that
he
had
sense
and
independence
enough
to
choose
the
wife
who
was
likely
to
make
him
happy
,
unbiassed
by
any
indirect
considerations
.
<EOS>
He
meant
to
choose
Lucy
;
she
was
a
little
darling
,
and
exactly
the
sort
of
woman
he
had
always
admired
.
    
<EOS>
First
Impressions
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
very
clever
,
Maggie
,
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
She
was
kneeling
on
a
footstool
at
Maggie
's
feet
,
after
placing
that
dark
lady
in
the
large
crimson
-
velvet
chair
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
sure
you
will
like
him
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
very
difficult
to
please
,
"
said
Maggie
,
smiling
,
and
holding
up
one
of
Lucy
's
long
curls
,
that
the
sunlight
might
shine
through
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
gentleman
who
thinks
he
is
good
enough
for
Lucy
must
expect
to
be
sharply
criticised
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
he
's
a
great
deal
too
good
for
me
.
<EOS>
And
sometimes
,
when
he
is
away
,
I
almost
think
it
ca
n't
really
be
that
he
loves
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
never
doubt
it
when
he
is
with
me
,
though
I
could
n't
bear
any
one
<EOS>
but
you
to
know
that
I
feel
in
that
way
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
then
,
if
I
disapprove
of
him
you
can
give
him
up
,
since
you
are
not
engaged
,
"
said
Maggie
,
with
playful
gravity
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not
be
engaged
.
<EOS>
When
people
are
engaged
,
they
begin
to
think
of
being
married
soon
,
"
said
Lucy
,
too
thoroughly
preoccupied
to
notice
Maggie
's
joke
;
"
and
I
should
like
everything
to
go
on
for
a
long
while
just
as
it
is
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
am
quite
frightened
lest
Stephen
should
say
that
he
has
spoken
to
papa
;
and
from
something
that
fell
from
papa
the
other
day
,
I
feel
sure
he
and
Mr.
Guest
are
expecting
that
.
<EOS>
And
Stephen
's
sisters
are
very
civil
to
me
now
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
I
think
they
did
n't
like
his
paying
me
attention
;
and
that
was
natural
.
<EOS>
It
_
does
_
seem
out
of
keeping
that
I
should
ever
live
in
a
great
place
like
the
Park
House
,
such
a
little
insignificant
thing
as
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
people
are
not
expected
to
be
large
in
proportion
to
the
houses
they
live
in
,
like
snails
,
"
said
Maggie
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
are
Mr.
Guest
's
sisters
giantesses
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
;
and
not
handsome
,
 
that
is
,
not
very
,
"
said
Lucy
,
half
-
penitent
at
this
uncharitable
remark
.
<EOS>
"
But
_
he
_
is
 
at
least
he
is
generally
considered
very
handsome
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Though
you
are
unable
to
share
that
opinion
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Lucy
,
blushing
pink
over
brow
and
neck
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
bad
plan
to
raise
expectation
;
you
will
perhaps
be
disappointed
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
prepared
a
charming
surprise
for
_
him
;
_
I
shall
have
a
glorious
laugh
against
him
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
tell
you
what
it
is
,
though
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
rose
from
her
knees
and
went
to
a
little
distance
,
holding
her
pretty
head
on
one
side
,
as
if
she
had
been
arranging
Maggie
for
a
portrait
,
and
wished
to
judge
of
the
general
effect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stand
up
a
moment
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
pleasure
now
?
"
said
Maggie
,
smiling
languidly
as
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
looked
down
on
her
slight
,
aerial
cousin
,
whose
figure
was
quite
subordinate
to
her
faultless
drapery
of
silk
and
crape
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
kept
her
contemplative
attitude
a
moment
or
two
in
silence
,
and
then
said
,
    
"
I
ca
n't
think
what
witchery
it
is
in
you
,
Maggie
,
that
makes
you
look
best
in
shabby
clothes
;
though
you
really
must
have
a
new
dress
now
.
<EOS>
But
do
you
know
,
last
night
I
was
trying
to
fancy
you
in
a
handsome
,
fashionable
dress
,
and
do
what
I
would
,
that
old
limp
merino
would
come
back
as
the
only
right
thing
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
Marie
Antoinette
looked
all
the
grander
when
her
gown
was
darned
at
the
elbows
.
<EOS>
Now
,
if
_
I
_
were
to
put
anything
shabby
on
,
I
should
be
quite
unnoticeable
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
a
mere
rag
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
quite
,
"
said
Maggie
,
with
mock
gravity
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
be
liable
to
be
swept
out
of
the
room
with
the
cobwebs
and
carpet
-
dust
,
and
to
find
yourself
under
the
grate
,
like
Cinderella
.
<EOS>
May
n't
I
sit
down
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
now
you
may
,
"
said
Lucy
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
Then
,
with
an
air
of
serious
reflection
,
unfastening
her
large
jet
brooch
,
"
But
you
must
change
brooches
,
Maggie
;
that
little
butterfly
looks
silly
on
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
wo
n't
that
mar
the
charming
effect
of
my
consistent
shabbiness
?
<EOS>
"
said
Maggie
,
seating
herself
submissively
,
while
Lucy
knelt
again
and
unfastened
the
contemptible
butterfly
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
my
mother
were
of
your
opinion
,
for
she
was
fretting
last
night
because
this
is
my
best
frock
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
saving
my
money
to
pay
for
some
lessons
;
I
shall
never
get
a
better
situation
without
more
accomplishments
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
gave
a
little
sigh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
do
n't
put
on
that
sad
look
again
,
"
said
Lucy
,
pinning
the
large
brooch
below
Maggie
's
fine
throat
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
forgetting
that
you
've
left
that
dreary
schoolroom
behind
you
,
and
have
no
little
girls
'
clothes
to
mend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
with
me
as
I
used
to
think
it
would
be
with
the
poor
uneasy
white
bear
I
saw
at
the
show
.
<EOS>
I
thought
he
must
have
got
so
stupid
with
the
habit
of
turning
backward
and
forward
in
that
narrow
space
that
he
would
keep
doing
it
if
they
set
him
free
.
<EOS>
One
gets
a
bad
habit
of
being
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
put
you
under
a
discipline
of
pleasure
that
will
make
you
lose
that
bad
habit
,
"
said
Lucy
,
sticking
the
black
butterfly
absently
in
her
own
collar
,
while
her
eyes
met
Maggie
's
affectionately
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
dear
,
tiny
thing
,
"
said
Maggie
,
in
one
of
her
bursts
of
loving
admiration
,
"
you
enjoy
other
people
's
happiness
so
much
,
I
believe
you
would
do
without
any
of
your
own
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
were
like
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
never
been
tried
in
that
way
,
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
always
been
so
happy
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
could
bear
much
trouble
;
I
never
had
any
but
poor
mamma
's
death
.
<EOS>
You
_
have
_
been
tried
,
Maggie
;
and
I
'm
sure
you
feel
for
other
people
quite
as
much
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
Lucy
,
"
said
Maggie
,
shaking
her
head
slowly
,
"
I
do
n't
enjoy
their
happiness
as
you
do
,
<EOS>
else
I
should
be
more
contented
.
<EOS>
I
do
feel
for
them
when
they
are
in
trouble
;
I
do
n't
think
I
could
ever
bear
to
make
any
one
_
un_happy
;
and
yet
I
often
hate
myself
,
because
I
get
angry
sometimes
at
the
sight
of
happy
people
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
get
worse
as
I
get
older
,
more
selfish
.
<EOS>
That
seems
very
dreadful
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Maggie
!
"
said
Lucy
,
in
a
tone
of
remonstrance
,
"
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
of
that
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
a
gloomy
fancy
,
just
because
you
are
depressed
by
a
dull
,
wearisome
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
perhaps
it
is
,
"
said
Maggie
,
resolutely
clearing
away
the
clouds
from
her
face
with
a
bright
smile
,
and
throwing
herself
backward
in
her
chair
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
comes
from
the
school
diet
,
 
watery
rice
-
pudding
spiced
with
Pinnock
.
<EOS>
Let
us
hope
it
will
give
way
before
my
mother
's
custards
and
this
charming
Geoffrey
Crayon
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
took
up
the
"
Sketch
Book
,
"
which
lay
by
her
on
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
look
fit
to
be
seen
with
this
little
brooch
?
"
said
Lucy
,
going
to
survey
the
effect
in
the
chimney
-
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
Mr.
Guest
will
be
obliged
to
go
out
of
the
room
again
if
he
sees
you
in
it
.
<EOS>
Pray
make
haste
and
put
another
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
hurried
out
of
the
room
,
but
Maggie
did
not
take
the
opportunity
of
opening
her
book
;
she
let
it
fall
on
her
knees
,
while
her
eyes
wandered
to
the
window
,
where
she
could
see
the
sunshine
falling
on
the
rich
clumps
of
spring
flowers
and
on
the
long
hedge
of
laurels
,
and
beyond
,
the
silvery
breadth
of
the
dear
old
Floss
,
that
at
this
distance
seemed
to
be
sleeping
in
a
morning
holiday
.
<EOS>
The
sweet
fresh
garden
-
scent
came
through
the
open
window
,
and
the
birds
were
busy
flitting
and
alighting
,
gurgling
and
singing
.
<EOS>
Yet
Maggie
's
eyes
began
to
fill
with
tears
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
the
old
scenes
had
made
the
rush
of
memories
so
painful
that
even
yesterday
she
had
only
been
able
to
rejoice
in
her
mother
's
restored
comfort
and
Tom
's
brotherly
friendliness
as
we
rejoice
in
good
news
of
friends
at
a
distance
,
rather
than
in
the
presence
of
a
happiness
which
we
share
.
<EOS>
Memory
and
imagination
urged
upon
her
a
sense
of
privation
too
keen
to
let
her
taste
what
was
offered
in
the
transient
present
.
<EOS>
Her
future
,
she
thought
,
was
likely
to
be
worse
than
her
past
,
for
after
her
years
of
contented
renunciation
,
she
had
slipped
back
into
desire
and
longing
;
she
found
joyless
days
of
distasteful
occupation
harder
and
harder
;
she
found
the
image
of
the
intense
and
varied
life
she
yearned
for
,
and
despaired
of
,
becoming
more
and
more
importunate
.
<EOS>
The
sound
of
the
opening
door
roused
her
,
and
hastily
wiping
away
her
tears
,
she
began
to
turn
over
the
leaves
of
her
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
one
pleasure
,
I
know
,
Maggie
,
that
your
deepest
dismalness
will
never
resist
,
"
said
Lucy
,
beginning
to
speak
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
music
,
and
I
mean
you
to
have
quite
a
riotous
feast
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
mean
you
to
get
up
your
playing
again
,
which
used
to
be
so
much
better
than
mine
,
when
we
were
at
Laceham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
have
laughed
to
see
me
playing
the
little
girls
'
tunes
over
and
over
to
them
,
when
I
took
them
to
practise
,
"
said
Maggie
,
"
just
for
the
sake
of
fingering
the
dear
keys
again
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
could
play
anything
more
difficult
now
than
"
Begone
,
dull
care
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
know
what
a
wild
state
of
joy
you
used
to
be
in
when
the
glee
-
men
came
round
,
"
said
Lucy
,
taking
up
her
embroidery
;
"
and
we
might
have
all
those
old
glees
that
you
used
to
love
so
,
if
I
were
certain
that
you
do
n't
feel
exactly
as
Tom
does
about
some
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
thought
there
was
nothing
you
might
be
more
certain
of
,
"
said
Maggie
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ought
rather
to
have
said
,
one
particular
thing
.
<EOS>
Because
if
you
feel
just
as
he
does
about
that
,
we
shall
want
our
third
voice
.
<EOS>
St.
Ogg
's
is
so
miserably
provided
with
musical
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
There
are
really
only
Stephen
and
Philip
Wakem
who
have
any
knowledge
of
music
,
so
as
to
be
able
to
sing
a
part
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
had
looked
up
from
her
work
as
she
uttered
the
last
sentence
,
and
saw
that
there
was
a
change
in
Maggie
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
it
hurt
you
to
hear
the
name
mentioned
,
Maggie
?
<EOS>
If
it
does
,
I
will
not
speak
of
him
again
.
<EOS>
I
know
Tom
will
not
see
him
if
he
can
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
feel
at
all
as
Tom
does
on
that
subject
,
"
said
Maggie
,
rising
and
going
to
the
window
as
if
she
wanted
to
see
more
of
the
landscape
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
always
liked
Philip
Wakem
ever
since
I
was
a
little
girl
,
and
saw
him
at
Lorton
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
good
when
Tom
hurt
his
foot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
'm
so
glad
!
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
Then
you
wo
n't
mind
his
coming
sometimes
,
and
we
can
have
much
more
music
than
we
could
without
him
.
<EOS>
I
'm
very
fond
of
poor
Philip
,
only
I
wish
he
were
not
so
morbid
about
his
deformity
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
_
is
_
<EOS>
his
deformity
that
makes
him
so
sad
,
and
sometimes
bitter
.
<EOS>
It
is
certainly
very
piteous
to
see
his
poor
little
crooked
body
and
pale
face
among
great
,
strong
people
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Lucy
   
"
said
Maggie
,
trying
to
arrest
the
prattling
stream
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
there
is
the
door
-
bell
.
<EOS>
That
must
be
Stephen
,
"
Lucy
went
on
,
not
noticing
Maggie
's
faint
effort
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
One
of
the
things
I
most
admire
in
Stephen
is
that
he
makes
a
greater
friend
of
Philip
than
any
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
too
late
for
Maggie
to
speak
now
;
the
drawingroom
door
was
opening
,
and
Minny
was
already
growling
in
a
small
way
at
the
entrance
of
a
tall
gentleman
,
who
went
up
to
Lucy
and
took
her
hand
with
a
half
-
polite
,
half
-
tender
glance
and
tone
of
inquiry
,
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
was
unconscious
of
any
other
presence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
introduce
you
to
my
cousin
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
"
said
Lucy
,
turning
with
wicked
enjoyment
toward
Maggie
,
who
now
approached
from
the
farther
window
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
one
instant
Stephen
could
not
conceal
his
astonishment
at
the
sight
of
this
tall
,
dark
-
eyed
nymph
with
her
jet
-
black
coronet
of
hair
;
the
next
,
Maggie
felt
herself
,
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
,
receiving
the
tribute
of
a
very
deep
blush
and
a
very
deep
bow
from
a
person
toward
whom
she
herself
was
conscious
of
timidity
.
  
<EOS>
This
new
experience
was
very
agreeable
to
her
,
so
agreeable
that
it
almost
effaced
her
previous
emotion
about
Philip
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
new
brightness
in
her
eyes
,
and
a
very
becoming
flush
on
her
cheek
,
as
she
seated
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
perceive
what
a
striking
likeness
you
drew
the
day
before
yesterday
,
"
said
Lucy
,
with
a
pretty
laugh
of
triumph
.
<EOS>
She
enjoyed
her
lover
's
confusion
;
the
advantage
was
usually
on
his
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
designing
cousin
of
yours
quite
deceived
me
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
"
said
Stephen
,
seating
himself
by
Lucy
,
and
stooping
to
play
with
Minny
,
only
looking
at
Maggie
furtively
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
said
you
had
light
hair
and
blue
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
it
was
you
who
said
so
,
"
remonstrated
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
refrained
from
destroying
your
confidence
in
your
own
second
-
sight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
always
err
in
the
same
way
,
"
said
Stephen
,
"
and
find
reality
so
much
more
beautiful
than
my
preconceptions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
you
have
proved
yourself
equal
to
the
occasion
,
"
said
Maggie
,
"
and
said
what
it
was
incumbent
on
you
to
say
under
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
flashed
a
slightly
defiant
look
at
him
;
it
was
clear
to
her
that
he
had
been
drawing
a
satirical
portrait
of
her
beforehand
.
<EOS>
Lucy
had
said
he
was
inclined
to
be
satirical
,
and
Maggie
had
mentally
supplied
the
addition
,
"
and
rather
conceited
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
An
alarming
amount
of
devil
there
,
"
was
Stephen
's
first
thought
.
<EOS>
The
second
,
when
she
had
bent
over
her
work
,
was
,
"
I
wish
she
would
look
at
me
again
.
"
<EOS>
The
next
was
to
answer
,
    
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
all
phrases
of
mere
compliment
have
their
turn
to
be
true
.
<EOS>
A
man
is
occasionally
grateful
when
he
says
"
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
rather
hard
upon
him
that
he
must
use
the
same
words
with
which
all
the
world
declines
a
disagreeable
invitation
,
do
n't
you
think
so
,
Miss
Tulliver
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Maggie
,
looking
at
him
with
her
direct
glance
;
"
if
we
use
common
words
on
a
great
occasion
,
they
are
the
more
striking
,
because
they
are
felt
at
once
to
have
a
particular
meaning
,
like
old
banners
,
or
every
-
day
clothes
,
hung
up
in
a
sacred
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
my
compliment
ought
to
be
eloquent
,
"
said
Stephen
,
really
not
quite
knowing
what
he
said
while
Maggie
looked
at
him
,
"
seeing
that
the
words
were
so
far
beneath
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
compliment
can
be
eloquent
,
except
as
an
expression
of
indifference
,
"
said
Maggie
,
flushing
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
was
rather
alarmed
;
she
thought
Stephen
and
Maggie
were
not
going
to
like
each
other
.
<EOS>
She
had
always
feared
lest
Maggie
should
appear
too
old
and
clever
to
please
that
critical
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
dear
Maggie
,
"
she
interposed
,
"
you
have
always
pretended
that
you
are
too
fond
of
being
admired
;
and
now
,
I
think
,
you
are
angry
because
some
one
ventures
to
admire
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
said
Maggie
;
"
I
like
too
well
to
feel
that
I
am
admired
,
but
compliments
never
make
me
feel
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
pay
you
a
compliment
again
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
"
said
Stephen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
;
that
will
be
a
proof
of
respect
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Maggie
!
<EOS>
She
was
so
unused
to
society
that
she
could
take
nothing
as
a
matter
of
course
,
and
had
never
in
her
life
spoken
from
the
lips
merely
,
so
that
she
must
necessarily
appear
absurd
to
more
experienced
ladies
,
from
the
excessive
feeling
she
was
apt
to
throw
into
very
trivial
incidents
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
even
conscious
herself
of
a
little
absurdity
in
this
instance
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
she
had
a
theoretic
objection
to
compliments
,
and
had
once
said
impatiently
to
Philip
that
she
did
n't
see
why
women
were
to
be
told
with
a
simper
that
they
were
beautiful
,
any
more
than
old
men
were
to
be
told
that
they
were
venerable
;
still
,
to
be
so
irritated
by
a
common
practice
in
the
case
of
a
stranger
like
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
,
and
to
care
about
his
having
spoken
slightingly
of
her
before
he
had
seen
her
,
was
certainly
unreasonable
,
and
as
soon
as
she
was
silent
she
began
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
occur
to
her
that
her
irritation
was
due
to
the
pleasanter
emotion
which
preceded
it
,
just
as
when
we
are
satisfied
with
a
sense
of
glowing
warmth
<EOS>
an
innocent
drop
of
cold
water
may
fall
upon
us
as
a
sudden
smart
.
  
<EOS>
Stephen
was
too
well
bred
not
to
seem
unaware
that
the
previous
conversation
could
have
been
felt
embarrassing
,
and
at
once
began
to
talk
of
impersonal
matters
,
asking
Lucy
if
she
knew
when
the
bazaar
was
at
length
to
take
place
,
so
that
there
might
be
some
hope
of
seeing
her
rain
the
influence
of
her
eyes
on
objects
more
grateful
than
those
worsted
flowers
that
were
growing
under
her
fingers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Some
day
next
month
,
I
believe
,
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
But
your
sisters
are
doing
more
for
it
than
I
am
;
they
are
to
have
the
largest
stall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
yes
;
but
they
carry
on
their
manufactures
in
their
own
sitting
-
room
,
where
I
do
n't
intrude
on
them
.
<EOS>
I
see
you
are
not
addicted
to
the
fashionable
vice
of
fancy
-
work
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
"
said
Stephen
,
looking
at
Maggie
's
plain
hemming
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Maggie
,
"
I
can
do
nothing
more
difficult
or
more
elegant
than
shirt
-
making
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
your
plain
sewing
is
so
beautiful
,
Maggie
,
"
said
Lucy
,
"
that
I
think
I
shall
beg
a
few
specimens
of
you
to
show
as
fancy
-
work
.
<EOS>
Your
exquisite
sewing
is
quite
a
mystery
to
me
,
you
used
to
dislike
that
sort
of
work
so
much
in
old
days
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
mystery
easily
explained
,
dear
,
"
said
Maggie
,
looking
up
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Plain
sewing
was
the
only
thing
I
could
get
money
by
,
so
I
was
obliged
to
try
and
do
it
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
,
good
and
simple
as
she
was
,
could
not
help
blushing
a
little
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
quite
like
that
Stephen
should
know
that
<EOS>
;
Maggie
need
not
have
mentioned
it
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
there
was
some
pride
in
the
confession
,
  
the
pride
of
poverty
that
will
not
be
ashamed
of
itself
.
<EOS>
But
if
Maggie
had
been
the
queen
of
coquettes
she
could
hardly
have
invented
a
means
of
giving
greater
piquancy
to
her
beauty
in
Stephen
's
eyes
;
I
am
not
sure
that
the
quiet
admission
of
plain
sewing
and
poverty
would
have
done
alone
,
but
assisted
by
the
beauty
,
they
made
Maggie
more
unlike
other
women
even
than
she
had
seemed
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
can
knit
,
Lucy
,
<EOS>
"
Maggie
went
on
,
"
if
that
will
be
of
any
use
for
your
bazaar
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
of
infinite
use
.
<EOS>
I
shall
set
you
to
work
with
scarlet
wool
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
But
your
sister
is
the
most
enviable
person
,
"
continued
Lucy
,
turning
to
Stephen
,
"
to
have
the
talent
of
modelling
.
<EOS>
She
is
doing
a
wonderful
bust
of
Dr.
Kenn
entirely
from
memory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
if
she
can
remember
to
put
the
eyes
very
near
together
,
and
the
corners
of
the
mouth
very
far
apart
,
the
likeness
can
hardly
fail
to
be
striking
in
St.
Ogg
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
that
is
very
wicked
of
you
,
"
said
Lucy
,
looking
rather
hurt
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
think
you
would
speak
disrespectfully
of
Dr.
Kenn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
anything
disrespectful
of
Dr.
Kenn
?
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
!
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
bound
to
respect
a
libellous
bust
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
Kenn
one
of
the
finest
fellows
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
much
about
the
tall
candlesticks
he
has
put
on
the
communion
-
table
,
and
I
should
n't
like
to
spoil
my
temper
by
getting
up
to
early
prayers
every
morning
.
<EOS>
But
he
's
the
only
man
I
ever
knew
personally
who
seems
to
me
to
have
anything
of
the
real
apostle
in
him
,
 
a
man
who
has
eight
hundred
a
-
year
and
is
contented
with
deal
furniture
and
boiled
beef
because
he
gives
away
two
-
thirds
of
his
income
.
<EOS>
That
was
a
very
fine
thing
of
him
,
 
taking
into
his
house
that
poor
lad
Grattan
,
who
shot
his
mother
by
accident
.
<EOS>
He
sacrifices
more
time
than
a
less
busy
man
could
spare
,
to
save
the
poor
fellow
from
getting
into
a
morbid
state
of
mind
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
takes
the
lad
out
with
him
constantly
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
beautiful
,
"
said
Maggie
,
who
had
let
her
work
fall
,
and
was
listening
with
keen
interest
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
knew
any
one
who
did
such
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
one
admires
that
sort
of
action
in
Kenn
all
the
more
,
"
said
Stephen
,
"
because
his
manners
in
general
are
rather
cold
and
severe
.
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
sugary
and
maudlin
about
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
think
he
's
a
perfect
character
!
"
<EOS>
said
Lucy
,
with
pretty
enthusiasm
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
there
I
ca
n't
agree
with
you
,
"
said
Stephen
,
shaking
his
head
with
sarcastic
gravity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
what
fault
can
you
point
out
in
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
an
Anglican
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
those
are
the
right
views
,
I
think
,
"
said
Lucy
,
gravely
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
settles
the
question
in
the
abstract
,
"
said
Stephen
,
"
but
not
from
a
parliamentary
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
He
has
set
the
Dissenters
and
the
Church
people
by
the
ears
;
and
a
rising
senator
like
myself
,
of
whose
services
the
country
is
very
much
in
need
,
will
find
it
inconvenient
when
he
puts
up
for
the
honor
of
representing
St.
Ogg
's
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
really
think
of
that
?
"
said
Lucy
,
her
eyes
brightening
with
a
proud
pleasure
that
made
her
neglect
the
argumentative
interests
of
Anglicanism
.
  
<EOS>
"
Decidedly
,
whenever
old
Mr.
Leyburn
's
public
spirit
and
gout
induce
him
to
give
way
.
<EOS>
My
father
's
heart
is
set
on
it
;
and
gifts
like
mine
,
you
know
"
 
here
Stephen
drew
himself
up
,
and
rubbed
his
large
white
hands
over
his
hair
with
playful
self
-
admiration
 
"
gifts
like
mine
involve
great
responsibilities
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
so
,
Miss
Tulliver
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Maggie
,
smiling
,
but
not
looking
up
;
"
so
much
fluency
and
self
-
possession
should
not
be
wasted
entirely
on
private
occasions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
see
how
much
penetration
you
have
,
"
said
Stephen
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
discovered
already
that
I
am
talkative
and
impudent
.
<EOS>
Now
superficial
people
never
discern
that
,
owing
to
my
manner
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
She
does
n't
look
at
me
when
I
talk
of
myself
,
"
he
thought
,
while
his
listeners
were
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
try
other
subjects
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Did
Lucy
intend
to
be
present
at
the
meeting
of
the
Book
Club
next
week
?
<EOS>
was
the
next
question
.
<EOS>
Then
followed
the
recommendation
to
choose
Southey
's
"
Life
of
Cowper
,
"
unless
she
were
inclined
to
be
philosophical
,
and
startle
the
ladies
of
St.
Ogg
's
by
voting
for
one
of
the
Bridgewater
Treatises
.
<EOS>
Of
course
Lucy
wished
to
know
what
these
alarmingly
learned
books
were
;
and
as
it
is
always
pleasant
to
improve
the
minds
of
ladies
by
talking
to
them
at
ease
on
subjects
of
which
they
know
nothing
,
Stephen
became
quite
brilliant
in
an
account
of
Buckland
's
Treatise
,
which
he
had
just
been
reading
.
<EOS>
He
was
rewarded
by
seeing
Maggie
let
her
work
fall
,
and
gradually
get
so
absorbed
in
his
wonderful
geological
story
that
she
sat
looking
at
him
,
leaning
forward
with
crossed
arms
,
and
with
an
entire
absence
of
self
-
consciousness
,
as
if
he
had
been
the
snuffiest
of
old
professors
,
and
she
a
downy
-
lipped
alumna
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
fascinated
by
the
clear
,
large
gaze
that
at
last
he
forgot
to
look
away
from
it
occasionally
toward
Lucy
;
but
she
,
sweet
child
,
was
only
rejoicing
that
Stephen
was
proving
to
Maggie
how
clever
he
was
,
and
that
they
would
certainly
be
good
friends
after
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
bring
you
the
book
,
shall
I
,
Miss
Tulliver
?
"
said
Stephen
,
when
he
found
the
stream
of
his
recollections
running
rather
shallow
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
many
illustrations
in
it
that
you
will
like
to
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
thank
you
,
"
said
Maggie
,
blushing
with
returning
self
-
consciousness
at
this
direct
address
,
and
taking
up
her
work
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
Lucy
interposed
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
forbid
your
plunging
Maggie
in
books
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
get
her
away
from
them
;
and
I
want
her
to
have
delicious
do
-
nothing
days
,
filled
with
boating
and
chatting
and
riding
and
driving
;
that
is
the
holiday
she
needs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Apropos
!
<EOS>
"
said
Stephen
,
looking
at
his
watch
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
we
go
out
for
a
row
on
the
river
now
?
<EOS>
The
tide
will
suit
for
us
to
the
Tofton
way
,
and
we
can
walk
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
That
was
a
delightful
proposition
to
Maggie
,
for
it
was
years
since
she
had
been
on
the
river
.
<EOS>
When
she
was
gone
to
put
on
her
bonnet
,
Lucy
lingered
to
give
an
order
to
the
servant
,
and
took
the
opportunity
of
telling
Stephen
that
Maggie
had
no
objection
to
seeing
Philip
,
so
that
it
was
a
pity
she
had
sent
that
note
the
day
before
yesterday
.
<EOS>
But
she
would
write
another
to
-
morrow
and
invite
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
call
and
beat
him
up
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Stephen
,
"
and
bring
him
with
me
in
the
evening
,
shall
I
?
<EOS>
My
sisters
will
want
to
call
on
you
when
I
tell
them
your
cousin
is
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
must
leave
the
field
clear
for
them
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
pray
bring
him
,
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
_
will
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
like
Maggie
,
sha'n"t
you
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
in
a
beseeching
tone
.
"
<EOS>
Is
n't
she
a
dear
,
noble
-
looking
creature
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Too
tall
,
"
said
Stephen
,
smiling
down
upon
her
,
"
and
a
little
too
fiery
.
<EOS>
She
is
not
my
type
of
woman
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
you
are
aware
,
are
apt
to
impart
these
imprudent
confidences
to
ladies
concerning
their
unfavorable
opinion
of
sister
fair
ones
.
<EOS>
That
is
why
so
many
women
have
the
advantage
of
knowing
that
they
are
secretly
repulsive
to
men
who
have
self
-
denyingly
made
ardent
love
to
them
.
<EOS>
And
hardly
anything
could
be
more
distinctively
characteristic
of
Lucy
than
that
she
both
implicitly
believed
what
Stephen
said
,
and
was
determined
that
Maggie
should
not
know
it
.
<EOS>
But
you
,
who
have
a
higher
logic
than
the
verbal
to
guide
you
,
have
already
foreseen
,
as
the
direct
sequence
to
that
unfavorable
opinion
of
Stephen
's
,
that
he
walked
down
to
the
boathouse
calculating
,
by
the
aid
of
a
vivid
imagination
,
that
Maggie
must
give
him
her
hand
at
least
twice
in
consequence
of
this
pleasant
boating
plan
,
and
that
a
gentleman
who
wishes
ladies
to
look
at
him
is
advantageously
situated
when
he
is
rowing
them
in
a
boat
.
<EOS>
What
then
?
<EOS>
Had
he
fallen
in
love
with
this
surprising
daughter
of
Mrs.
Tulliver
at
first
sight
?
<EOS>
Certainly
not
.
<EOS>
Such
passions
are
never
heard
of
in
real
life
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
was
in
love
already
,
and
half
-
engaged
to
the
dearest
little
creature
in
the
world
;
and
he
was
not
a
man
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
in
any
way
.
<EOS>
But
when
one
is
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
one
has
not
chalk
-
stones
at
one
's
finger
-
ends
that
the
touch
of
a
handsome
girl
should
be
entirely
indifferent
.
<EOS>
It
was
perfectly
natural
and
safe
to
admire
beauty
and
enjoy
looking
at
it
,
 
at
least
under
such
circumstances
as
the
present
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
really
something
very
interesting
about
this
girl
,
with
her
poverty
and
troubles
;
it
was
gratifying
to
see
the
friendship
between
the
two
cousins
.
<EOS>
Generally
,
Stephen
admitted
,
he
was
not
fond
of
women
who
had
any
peculiarity
of
character
,
but
here
the
peculiarity
seemed
really
of
a
superior
kind
,
and
provided
one
is
not
obliged
to
marry
such
women
,
why
,
they
certainly
make
a
variety
in
social
intercourse
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
did
not
fulfil
Stephen
's
hope
by
looking
at
him
during
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
;
her
eyes
were
too
full
of
the
old
banks
that
she
knew
so
well
.
<EOS>
She
felt
lonely
,
cut
off
from
Philip
,
 
the
only
person
who
had
ever
seemed
to
love
her
devotedly
,
as
she
had
always
longed
to
be
loved
.
<EOS>
But
presently
the
rhythmic
movement
of
the
oars
attracted
her
,
and
she
thought
she
should
like
to
learn
how
to
row
.
<EOS>
This
roused
her
from
her
reverie
,
and
she
asked
if
she
might
take
an
oar
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
that
she
required
much
teaching
,
and
she
became
ambitious
.
<EOS>
The
exercise
brought
the
warm
blood
into
her
cheeks
,
and
made
her
inclined
to
take
her
lesson
merrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
be
satisfied
until
I
can
manage
both
oars
,
and
row
you
and
Lucy
,
"
she
said
,
looking
very
bright
as
she
stepped
out
of
the
boat
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
we
know
,
was
apt
to
forget
the
thing
she
was
doing
,
and
she
had
chosen
an
inopportune
moment
for
her
remark
;
her
foot
slipped
,
but
happily
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
held
her
hand
,
and
kept
her
up
with
a
firm
grasp
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
hurt
yourself
at
all
,
I
hope
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
bending
to
look
in
her
face
with
anxiety
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
charming
to
be
taken
care
of
in
that
kind
,
graceful
manner
by
some
one
taller
and
stronger
than
one
's
self
.
<EOS>
Maggie
had
never
felt
just
in
the
same
way
before
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
reached
home
again
,
they
found
uncle
and
aunt
Pullet
seated
with
Mrs.
Tulliver
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
Stephen
hurried
away
,
asking
leave
to
come
again
in
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
pray
bring
with
you
the
volume
of
Purcell
that
you
took
away
,
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
Maggie
to
hear
your
best
songs
.
"
  
<EOS>
Aunt
Pullet
,
under
the
certainty
that
Maggie
would
be
invited
to
go
out
with
Lucy
,
probably
to
Park
House
,
was
much
shocked
at
the
shabbiness
of
her
clothes
,
which
when
witnessed
by
the
higher
society
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
would
be
a
discredit
to
the
family
,
that
demanded
a
strong
and
prompt
remedy
;
and
the
consultation
as
to
what
would
be
most
suitable
to
this
end
from
among
the
superfluities
of
Mrs.
Pullet
's
wardrobe
was
one
that
Lucy
as
well
as
Mrs.
Tulliver
entered
into
with
some
zeal
.
<EOS>
Maggie
must
really
have
an
evening
dress
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
she
was
about
the
same
height
as
aunt
Pullet
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
she
's
so
much
broader
across
the
shoulders
than
I
am
,
it
's
very
ill
-
convenient
,
"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
"
else
she
might
wear
that
beautiful
black
brocade
o
'
mine
without
any
alteration
;
and
her
arms
are
beyond
everything
,
"
added
Mrs.
Pullet
,
sorrowfully
,
as
she
lifted
Maggie
's
large
round
arm
,
"
She
'd
never
get
my
sleeves
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
never
mind
that
,
aunt
;
send
us
the
dress
,
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
Maggie
to
have
long
sleeves
,
and
I
have
abundance
of
black
lace
for
trimming
.
<EOS>
Her
arms
will
look
beautiful
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
's
arms
_
are
_
a
pretty
shape
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
"
They
're
like
mine
used
to
be
,
only
mine
was
never
brown
;
I
wish
she
'd
had
_
our
_
family
skin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
aunty
!
"
said
Lucy
,
patting
her
aunt
Tulliver
's
shoulder
,
"
you
do
n't
understand
those
things
.
<EOS>
A
painter
would
think
Maggie
's
complexion
beautiful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Maybe
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
submissively
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
better
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
Only
when
I
was
young
a
brown
skin
was
n't
thought
well
on
among
respectable
folks
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
uncle
Pullet
,
who
took
intense
interest
in
the
ladies
'
conversation
as
he
sucked
his
lozenges
.
<EOS>
"
Though
there
was
a
song
about
the
"
Nut
-
brown
Maid
"
too
;
I
think
she
was
crazy
,
 
crazy
Kate
,
 
<EOS>
but
I
ca
n't
justly
remember
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
dear
!
"
said
Maggie
,
laughing
,
but
impatient
;
"
I
think
that
will
be
the
end
of
_
my
_
brown
skin
,
if
it
is
always
to
be
talked
about
so
much
.
"
    
<EOS>
Confidential
Moments
  
<EOS>
When
Maggie
went
up
to
her
bedroom
that
night
,
it
appeared
that
she
was
not
at
all
inclined
to
undress
.
<EOS>
She
set
down
her
candle
on
the
first
table
that
presented
itself
,
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
her
room
,
which
was
a
large
one
,
with
a
firm
,
regular
,
and
rather
rapid
step
,
which
showed
that
the
exercise
was
the
instinctive
vent
of
strong
excitement
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
and
cheeks
had
an
almost
feverish
brilliancy
;
her
head
was
thrown
backward
,
and
her
hands
were
clasped
with
the
palms
outward
,
and
with
that
tension
of
the
arms
which
is
apt
to
accompany
mental
absorption
.
  
<EOS>
Had
anything
remarkable
happened
?
  
<EOS>
Nothing
that
you
are
not
likely
to
consider
in
the
highest
degree
unimportant
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
hearing
some
fine
music
sung
by
a
fine
bass
voice
,
 
but
then
it
was
sung
in
a
provincial
,
amateur
fashion
,
such
as
would
have
left
a
critical
ear
much
to
desire
.
<EOS>
And
she
was
conscious
of
having
been
looked
at
a
great
deal
,
in
rather
a
furtive
manner
,
from
beneath
a
pair
of
well
-
marked
horizontal
eyebrows
,
with
a
glance
that
seemed
somehow
to
have
caught
the
vibratory
influence
of
the
voice
.
<EOS>
Such
things
could
have
had
no
perceptible
effect
on
a
thoroughly
well
-
educated
young
lady
,
with
a
perfectly
balanced
mind
,
who
had
had
all
the
advantages
of
fortune
,
training
,
and
refined
society
.
<EOS>
But
if
Maggie
had
been
that
young
lady
,
you
would
probably
have
known
nothing
about
her
:
her
life
would
have
had
so
few
vicissitudes
that
it
could
hardly
have
been
written
;
for
the
happiest
women
,
like
the
happiest
nations
,
have
no
history
.
  
<EOS>
In
poor
Maggie
's
highly
-
strung
,
hungry
nature
,
 
just
come
away
from
a
third
-
rate
schoolroom
,
with
all
its
jarring
sounds
and
petty
round
of
tasks
,
 
these
apparently
trivial
causes
had
the
effect
of
rousing
and
exalting
her
imagination
in
a
way
that
was
mysterious
to
herself
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
she
thought
distinctly
of
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
,
or
dwelt
on
the
indications
that
he
looked
at
her
with
admiration
;
it
was
rather
that
she
felt
the
half
-
remote
presence
of
a
world
of
love
and
beauty
and
delight
,
made
up
of
vague
,
mingled
images
from
all
the
poetry
and
romance
she
had
ever
read
,
or
had
ever
woven
in
her
dreamy
reveries
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
glanced
back
once
or
twice
to
the
time
when
she
had
courted
privation
,
when
she
had
thought
all
longing
,
all
impatience
was
subdued
;
but
that
condition
seemed
irrecoverably
gone
,
and
she
recoiled
from
the
remembrance
of
it
.
<EOS>
No
prayer
,
no
striving
now
,
would
bring
back
that
negative
peace
;
the
battle
of
her
life
,
it
seemed
,
was
not
to
be
decided
in
that
short
and
easy
way
,
 
by
perfect
renunciation
at
the
very
threshold
of
her
youth
.
  
<EOS>
The
music
was
vibrating
in
her
still
,
 
Purcell
's
music
,
with
its
wild
passion
and
fancy
,
 
and
<EOS>
she
could
not
stay
in
the
recollection
of
that
bare
,
lonely
past
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
her
brighter
aerial
world
again
,
when
a
little
tap
came
at
the
door
;
of
course
it
was
her
cousin
,
who
entered
in
ample
white
dressing
-
gown
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Maggie
,
you
naughty
child
,
have
n't
you
begun
to
undress
?
"
said
Lucy
,
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
I
promised
not
to
come
and
talk
to
you
,
because
I
thought
you
must
be
tired
.
<EOS>
But
here
you
are
,
looking
as
if
you
were
ready
to
dress
for
a
ball
.
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
<EOS>
get
on
your
dressing
-
gown
and
unplait
your
hair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
_
you
_
are
not
very
forward
,
"
retorted
Maggie
,
hastily
reaching
her
own
pink
cotton
gown
,
and
looking
at
Lucy
's
light
-
brown
hair
brushed
back
in
curly
disorder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
have
not
much
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
shall
sit
down
and
talk
to
you
till
I
see
you
are
really
on
the
way
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
While
Maggie
stood
and
unplaited
her
long
black
hair
over
her
pink
drapery
,
Lucy
sat
down
near
the
toilette
-
table
,
watching
her
with
affectionate
eyes
,
and
head
a
little
aside
,
like
a
pretty
spaniel
.
<EOS>
If
it
appears
to
you
at
all
incredible
that
young
ladies
should
be
led
on
to
talk
confidentially
in
a
situation
of
this
kind
,
I
will
beg
you
to
remember
that
human
life
furnishes
many
exceptional
cases
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
really
<EOS>
_
have
_
enjoyed
the
music
to
-
night
,
<EOS>
have
n't
you
Maggie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
that
is
what
prevented
me
from
feeling
sleepy
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
have
no
other
mortal
wants
,
if
I
could
always
have
plenty
of
music
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
infuse
strength
into
my
limbs
,
and
ideas
into
my
brain
.
<EOS>
Life
seems
to
go
on
without
effort
,
when
I
am
filled
with
music
.
<EOS>
At
other
times
one
is
conscious
of
carrying
a
weight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
Stephen
has
a
splendid
voice
,
has
n't
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
perhaps
we
are
neither
of
us
judges
of
that
,
"
said
Maggie
,
laughing
,
as
she
seated
herself
and
tossed
her
long
hair
back
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
impartial
,
and
_
<EOS>
I
_
think
any
barrel
-
organ
splendid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
tell
me
what
you
think
of
him
,
now
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
exactly
;
good
and
bad
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
think
you
should
humiliate
him
a
little
.
<EOS>
A
lover
should
not
be
so
much
at
ease
,
and
so
self
-
confident
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
tremble
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nonsense
,
Maggie
!
<EOS>
As
if
any
one
could
tremble
at
me
!
<EOS>
You
think
he
is
conceited
,
I
see
that
.
<EOS>
But
you
do
n't
dislike
him
,
do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dislike
him
!
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Am
I
in
the
habit
of
seeing
such
charming
people
,
that
I
should
be
very
difficult
to
please
?
<EOS>
Besides
,
how
could
I
dislike
any
one
that
promised
to
make
you
happy
,
my
dear
thing
!
"
<EOS>
Maggie
pinched
Lucy
's
dimpled
chin
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
more
music
to
-
morrow
evening
,
"
said
Lucy
,
looking
happy
already
,
"
for
Stephen
will
bring
Philip
Wakem
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lucy
,
I
ca
n't
see
him
,
"
said
Maggie
,
turning
pale
.
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
I
could
not
see
him
without
Tom
's
leave
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Tom
such
a
tyrant
as
that
?
"
said
Lucy
,
surprised
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
the
responsibility
,
then
,
 
tell
him
it
was
my
fault
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
dear
,
"
said
Maggie
,
falteringly
,
"
I
promised
Tom
very
solemnly
,
before
my
father
's
death
,
 
<EOS>
I
promised
him
I
would
not
speak
to
Philip
without
his
knowledge
and
consent
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
a
great
dread
of
opening
the
subject
with
Tom
,
 
of
getting
into
a
quarrel
with
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
never
heard
of
anything
so
strange
and
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
What
harm
can
poor
Philip
have
done
?
<EOS>
May
I
speak
to
Tom
about
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
pray
do
n't
,
dear
,
"
said
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
to
him
myself
to
-
morrow
,
and
tell
him
that
you
wish
Philip
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
've
thought
before
of
asking
him
to
absolve
me
from
my
promise
,
but
I
've
not
had
the
courage
to
determine
on
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
both
silent
for
some
moments
,
and
then
Lucy
said
,
    
"
Maggie
,
you
have
secrets
from
me
,
and
I
have
none
from
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
looked
meditatively
away
from
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Then
she
turned
to
her
and
said
,
"
I
_
should
_
like
to
tell
you
about
Philip
.
<EOS>
But
,
Lucy
,
you
must
not
betray
that
you
know
it
to
any
one
 
least
of
all
to
Philip
himself
,
or
to
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
narrative
lasted
long
,
for
Maggie
had
never
before
known
the
relief
of
such
an
outpouring
;
she
had
never
before
told
Lucy
anything
of
her
inmost
life
;
and
the
sweet
face
bent
toward
her
with
sympathetic
interest
,
and
the
little
hand
pressing
hers
,
encouraged
her
to
speak
on
.
<EOS>
On
two
points
only
she
was
not
expansive
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
betray
fully
what
still
rankled
in
her
mind
as
Tom
's
great
offence
,
 
the
insults
he
had
heaped
on
Philip
.
<EOS>
Angry
as
the
remembrance
still
made
her
<EOS>
,
she
could
not
bear
that
any
one
else
should
know
it
at
all
,
both
for
Tom
's
sake
and
Philip
's
.
<EOS>
And
she
could
not
bear
to
tell
Lucy
of
the
last
scene
between
her
father
and
Wakem
,
though
it
was
this
scene
which
she
had
ever
since
felt
to
be
a
new
barrier
between
herself
and
Philip
.
<EOS>
She
merely
said
,
she
saw
now
that
Tom
was
,
on
the
whole
,
right
in
regarding
any
prospect
of
love
and
marriage
between
her
and
Philip
as
put
out
of
the
question
by
the
relation
of
the
two
families
.
<EOS>
Of
course
Philip
's
father
would
never
consent
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
Lucy
,
you
have
had
my
story
,
"
said
Maggie
,
smiling
,
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
I
am
like
Sir
Andrew
Aguecheek
.
<EOS>
_
I
_
was
adored
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
now
I
see
how
it
is
<EOS>
you
know
Shakespeare
and
everything
,
and
have
learned
so
much
since
you
left
school
;
which
always
seemed
to
me
witchcraft
before
,
 
part
of
your
general
uncanniness
,
"
said
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
She
mused
a
little
with
her
eyes
downward
,
and
then
added
,
looking
at
Maggie
,
"
It
is
very
beautiful
that
you
should
love
Philip
<EOS>
;
I
never
thought
such
a
happiness
would
befall
him
.
<EOS>
And
in
my
opinion
,
you
ought
not
to
give
him
up
.
<EOS>
There
are
obstacles
now
;
but
they
may
be
done
away
with
in
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
shook
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
persisted
Lucy
;
"
I
ca
n't
help
being
hopeful
about
it
.
<EOS>
There
is
something
romantic
in
it
,
 
out
of
the
common
way
,
 
just
what
everything
that
happens
to
you
ought
to
be
.
<EOS>
And
Philip
will
adore
you
like
a
husband
in
a
fairy
tale
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
shall
puzzle
my
small
brain
to
contrive
some
plot
that
will
bring
everybody
into
the
right
mind
,
so
that
you
may
marry
Philip
when
I
marry
 
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
Would
n't
that
be
a
pretty
ending
to
all
my
poor
,
poor
Maggie
's
troubles
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
tried
to
smile
,
but
shivered
,
as
if
she
felt
a
sudden
chill
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
dear
,
you
are
cold
,
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
go
to
bed
;
and
so
must
I.
I
dare
not
think
what
time
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
kissed
each
other
,
and
Lucy
went
away
,
possessed
of
a
confidence
which
had
a
strong
influence
over
her
subsequent
impressions
.
<EOS>
Maggie
had
been
thoroughly
sincere
;
her
nature
had
never
found
it
easy
to
be
otherwise
.
<EOS>
But
confidences
are
sometimes
blinding
,
even
when
they
are
sincere
.
    
<EOS>
Brother
and
Sister
  
Maggie
was
obliged
to
go
to
Tom
's
lodgings
in
the
middle
of
the
day
,
when
he
would
be
coming
in
to
dinner
,
else
she
would
not
have
found
him
at
home
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
lodging
with
entire
strangers
.
<EOS>
Our
friend
Bob
Jakin
had
,
with
Mumps
's
tacit
consent
,
taken
not
only
a
wife
about
eight
months
ago
,
but
also
one
of
those
queer
old
houses
,
pierced
with
surprising
passages
,
by
the
water
-
side
,
where
,
as
he
observed
,
his
wife
and
mother
could
keep
themselves
out
of
mischief
by
letting
out
two
"
pleasure
-
boats
,
"
in
which
he
had
invested
some
of
his
savings
,
and
by
taking
in
a
lodger
for
the
parlor
and
spare
bedroom
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
,
what
could
be
better
for
the
interests
of
all
parties
,
sanitary
considerations
apart
,
than
that
the
lodger
should
be
Mr.
Tom
?
  
<EOS>
It
was
Bob
's
wife
who
opened
the
door
to
Maggie
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
tiny
woman
,
with
the
general
physiognomy
of
a
Dutch
doll
,
looking
,
in
comparison
with
Bob
's
mother
,
who
filled
up
the
passage
in
the
rear
,
very
much
like
one
of
those
human
figures
which
the
artist
finds
conveniently
standing
near
a
colossal
statue
to
show
the
proportions
.
<EOS>
The
tiny
woman
curtsied
and
looked
up
at
Maggie
with
some
awe
as
soon
as
she
had
opened
the
door
;
but
the
words
,
"
Is
my
brother
at
home
?
"
<EOS>
which
Maggie
uttered
smilingly
,
made
her
turn
round
with
sudden
excitement
,
and
say
,
    
"
Eh
,
mother
,
mother
 
tell
Bob
!
 
<EOS>
it
's
Miss
Maggie
!
<EOS>
Come
in
,
Miss
,
for
goodness
do
,
"
she
went
on
,
opening
a
side
door
,
and
endeavoring
to
flatten
her
person
against
the
wall
to
make
the
utmost
space
for
the
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
Sad
recollections
crowded
on
Maggie
as
she
entered
the
small
parlor
,
which
was
now
all
that
poor
Tom
had
to
call
by
the
name
of
"
home
,
"
 
that
name
which
had
once
,
so
many
years
ago
,
meant
for
both
of
them
the
same
sum
of
dear
familiar
objects
.
<EOS>
But
everything
was
not
strange
to
her
in
this
new
room
;
the
first
thing
her
eyes
dwelt
on
was
the
large
old
Bible
,
and
the
sight
was
not
likely
to
disperse
the
old
memories
.
<EOS>
She
stood
without
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
to
take
the
privilege
o
'
sitting
down
,
Miss
,
"
said
Mrs.
Jakin
,
rubbing
her
apron
over
a
perfectly
clean
chair
,
and
then
lifting
up
the
corner
of
that
garment
and
holding
it
to
her
face
with
an
air
of
embarrassment
,
as
she
looked
wonderingly
at
Maggie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bob
is
at
home
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
said
Maggie
,
recovering
herself
,
and
smiling
at
the
bashful
Dutch
doll
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Miss
;
but
I
think
he
must
be
washing
and
dressing
himself
;
I
'll
go
and
see
,
"
said
Mrs.
Jakin
,
disappearing
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
presently
came
back
walking
with
new
courage
a
little
way
behind
her
husband
,
who
showed
the
brilliancy
of
his
blue
eyes
and
regular
white
teeth
in
the
doorway
,
bowing
respectfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Bob
?
"
said
Maggie
,
coming
forward
and
putting
out
her
hand
to
him
;
<EOS>
"
I
always
meant
to
pay
your
wife
a
visit
,
and
I
shall
come
another
day
on
purpose
for
that
,
if
she
will
let
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
obliged
to
come
to
-
day
to
speak
to
my
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
be
in
before
long
,
Miss.
<EOS>
He
's
doin'
finely
<EOS>
,
Mr.
Tom
is
;
he
'll
be
one
o
'
<EOS>
the
first
men
hereabouts
,
 
<EOS>
you
'll
see
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Bob
,
I
'm
sure
he
'll
be
indebted
to
you
,
whatever
he
becomes
;
he
said
so
himself
only
the
other
night
,
when
he
was
talking
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
Miss
,
that
's
his
way
<EOS>
o
'
takin
'
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
the
more
on't
when
he
says
a
thing
,
because
his
tongue
does
n't
overshoot
him
as
mine
does
.
<EOS>
Lors
!
<EOS>
I
'm
no
better
nor
a
tilted
bottle
,
<EOS>
I
ar'n"t
,
 
I
ca
n't
stop
mysen
when
once
I
begin
.
<EOS>
But
you
look
rarely
,
Miss
;
it
does
me
good
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
now
,
Prissy
?
"
 
<EOS>
here
Bob
turned
to
his
wife
,
 
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
it
all
come
true
as
I
said
?
<EOS>
Though
there
is
n't
many
sorts
o
'
goods
as
I
ca
n't
over
-
praise
when
I
set
my
tongue
to't

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bob
's
small
nose
seemed
to
be
following
the
example
of
her
eyes
in
turning
up
reverentially
toward
Maggie
,
but
she
was
able
now
to
smile
and
curtsey
,
and
say
,
"
I
'd
looked
forrard
like
aenything
to
seein

you

"
  
<EOS>
"
Well

said
Bob
,
looking
rather
silly
.
<EOS>
"

Go

"
I

Mumps

said
Maggie
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
you
used
to
say
he
would

Eh

Miss

said
Bob
,
"
he
made
up
his
mind
to't
when
he
see'd
what
a
little
un
she
was

He
pretends
not
to
see
her
mostly
,
or
else
to
think
as
she
is
n't
full

growed

<EOS>
But
about
Mr.
Tom
,
Miss

"
said
Bob
,
speaking
lower
and
looking
serious
,
"
he
's
as
close
as
a
iron
biler
<EOS>
,
he
is
;
but
I
'm
a
"
cutish
chap
,
an

<EOS>
when
I
've
left
off
carrying
my
pack
,
an

am
at
a
loose
end
,
I
've
got
more
brains
nor
I
know
what
to
do
wi

an

I
'm
forced
to
busy
myself
wi

other
folks
's
insides

<EOS>
An

<EOS>
it
worrets
me
as
Mr.
Tom'll
sit
by
himself
so
glumpish
,
<EOS>
a
-
knittin
'
his
brow
,
an

a

lookin

at
the
fire
of
a
night

<EOS>
He
should
be
a
bit
livelier
now
,
a
fine
young
fellow
like
him
.
<EOS>
My
wife
says
,
when
she
goes
in
sometimes
,
an
'
<EOS>
he
takes
no
notice
of
her

he
sits
lookin

into
the
fire
,
and
frownin

as
if
he
was
watchin
'
folks
at
work
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
thinks
so
much
about
business
,
"
said
Maggie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
said
Bob
,
speaking
lower
;
"
but
<EOS>
do
you
think
it
's
nothin'
else
,
Miss
?
<EOS>
He
's
close
,
Mr.
Tom
is
;
but
I
'm
a
"
cute
chap
,
I
am
,
an
'
I
thought
tow'rt
last
Christmas
as
I
'd
found
out
a
soft
place
in
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
about
a
little
black
spaniel
 
<EOS>
a
rare
bit
o
'
breed
 
as
he
made
a
fuss
to
get
.
<EOS>
But
since
then
summat
's
come
over
him
,
as
he
's
set
his
teeth
again
'
things
more
nor
iver
,
for
all
he
's
had
such
good
luck
.
<EOS>
An
'
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
tell
_
you
_
,
Miss
,
"
cause
I
thought
you
might
work
it
out
of
him
a
bit
,
now
you
're
come
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
deal
too
lonely
,
and
does
n't
go
into
company
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
I
have
very
little
power
over
him
,
Bob
,
"
said
Maggie
,
a
good
deal
moved
by
Bob
's
suggestion
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
totally
new
idea
to
her
mind
that
Tom
could
have
his
love
troubles
.
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
and
in
love
with
Lucy
too
!
<EOS>
But
it
was
perhaps
a
mere
fancy
of
Bob
's
too
officious
brain
.
<EOS>
The
present
of
the
dog
meant
nothing
more
than
cousinship
and
gratitude
.
<EOS>
But
Bob
had
already
said
,
"
Here
's
Mr.
Tom
,
"
and
the
outer
door
was
opening
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
time
to
spare
,
Tom
,
"
said
Maggie
,
as
soon
as
Bob
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
tell
you
at
once
what
I
came
about
,
else
I
shall
be
hindering
you
from
taking
your
dinner
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
stood
with
his
back
against
the
chimney
-
piece
,
and
Maggie
was
seated
opposite
the
light
.
<EOS>
He
noticed
that
she
was
tremulous
,
and
he
had
a
presentiment
of
the
subject
she
was
going
to
speak
about
.
<EOS>
The
presentiment
made
his
voice
colder
and
harder
as
he
said
,
"
What
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
This
tone
roused
a
spirit
of
resistance
in
Maggie
,
and
she
put
her
request
in
quite
a
different
form
from
the
one
she
had
predetermined
on
.
<EOS>
She
rose
from
her
seat
,
and
looking
straight
at
Tom
,
said
,
    
"
I
want
you
to
absolve
me
from
my
promise
about
Philip
Wakem
.
<EOS>
Or
rather
,
I
promised
you
not
to
see
him
without
telling
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
come
to
tell
you
that
I
wish
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
Tom
,
still
more
coldly
.
  
<EOS>
But
Maggie
had
hardly
finished
speaking
in
that
chill
,
defiant
manner
,
before
she
repented
,
and
felt
the
dread
of
alienation
from
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
for
myself
,
dear
Tom
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
angry
.
<EOS>
I
should
n't
have
asked
it
,
only
that
Philip
,
you
know
,
is
a
friend
of
Lucy
's
and
she
wishes
him
to
come
,
has
invited
him
to
come
this
evening
;
and
I
told
her
I
could
n't
see
him
without
telling
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
only
see
him
in
the
presence
of
other
people
.
<EOS>
There
will
never
be
anything
secret
between
us
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
looked
away
from
Maggie
,
knitting
his
brow
more
strongly
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
Then
he
turned
to
her
and
said
,
slowly
and
emphatically
,
    
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
is
my
feeling
on
that
subject
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
need
for
my
repeating
anything
I
said
a
year
ago
.
<EOS>
While
my
father
was
living
,
I
felt
bound
to
use
the
utmost
power
over
you
,
to
prevent
you
from
disgracing
him
as
well
as
yourself
,
and
all
of
us
.
<EOS>
But
now
I
must
leave
you
to
your
own
choice
.
<EOS>
You
wish
to
be
independent
;
you
told
me
so
after
my
father
's
death
.
<EOS>
My
opinion
is
not
changed
.
<EOS>
If
you
think
of
Philip
Wakem
as
a
lover
again
,
you
must
give
up
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
wish
it
,
dear
Tom
,
at
least
as
things
are
;
I
see
that
it
would
lead
to
misery
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
soon
go
away
to
another
situation
,
and
I
should
like
to
be
friends
with
him
again
while
I
am
here
.
<EOS>
Lucy
wishes
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
severity
of
Tom
's
face
relaxed
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
mind
your
seeing
him
occasionally
at
my
uncle
's
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
you
to
make
a
fuss
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
no
confidence
in
you
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
You
would
be
led
away
to
do
anything
.
"
  
<EOS>
That
was
a
cruel
word
.
<EOS>
Maggie
's
lip
began
to
tremble
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
will
you
say
that
,
Tom
?
<EOS>
It
is
very
hard
of
you
.
<EOS>
Have
I
not
done
and
borne
everything
as
well
as
I
could
?
<EOS>
And
I
kept
my
word
to
you
 
when
 
when
   
My
life
has
not
been
a
happy
one
,
any
more
than
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
obliged
to
be
childish
;
the
tears
would
come
.
<EOS>
When
Maggie
was
not
angry
,
she
was
as
dependent
on
kind
or
cold
words
as
a
daisy
on
the
sunshine
or
the
cloud
;
the
need
of
being
loved
would
always
subdue
her
,
as
,
in
old
days
,
it
subdued
her
in
the
worm
-
eaten
attic
.
<EOS>
The
brother
's
goodness
came
uppermost
at
this
appeal
,
but
it
could
only
show
itself
in
Tom
's
fashion
.
<EOS>
He
put
his
hand
gently
on
her
arm
,
and
said
,
in
the
tone
of
a
kind
pedagogue
,
    
"
Now
listen
to
me
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
You
're
always
in
extremes
;
you
have
no
judgment
and
self
-
command
;
and
yet
you
think
you
know
best
,
and
will
not
submit
to
be
guided
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
did
n't
wish
you
to
take
a
situation
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
Pullet
was
willing
to
give
you
a
good
home
,
and
you
might
have
lived
respectably
amongst
your
relations
,
until
I
could
have
provided
a
home
for
you
with
my
mother
.
<EOS>
And
that
is
what
I
should
like
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
wished
my
sister
to
be
a
lady
,
and
I
always
have
taken
care
of
you
,
as
my
father
desired
,
until
you
were
well
married
.
<EOS>
But
your
ideas
and
mine
never
accord
,
and
you
will
not
give
way
.
<EOS>
Yet
you
might
have
sense
enough
to
see
that
a
brother
,
who
goes
out
into
the
world
and
mixes
with
men
,
necessarily
knows
better
what
is
right
and
respectable
for
his
sister
than
she
can
know
herself
.
<EOS>
You
think
I
am
not
kind
;
but
my
kindness
can
only
be
directed
by
what
I
believe
to
be
good
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
know
,
dear
Tom
,
"
said
Maggie
,
still
half
-
sobbing
,
but
trying
to
control
her
tears
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
would
do
a
great
deal
for
me
;
I
know
how
you
work
,
and
do
n't
spare
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
am
grateful
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
you
ca
n't
quite
judge
for
me
;
our
natures
are
very
different
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
how
differently
things
affect
me
from
what
they
do
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
_
do
_
know
;
I
know
it
too
well
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
differently
you
must
feel
about
all
that
affects
our
family
,
and
your
own
dignity
as
a
young
woman
,
before
you
could
think
of
receiving
secret
addresses
from
Philip
Wakem
.
<EOS>
If
it
was
not
disgusting
to
me
in
every
other
way
,
I
should
object
to
my
sister
's
name
being
associated
for
a
moment
with
that
of
a
young
man
whose
father
must
hate
the
very
thought
of
us
all
,
and
would
spurn
you
.
<EOS>
With
any
one
<EOS>
but
you
,
I
should
think
it
quite
certain
that
what
you
witnessed
just
before
my
father
's
death
would
secure
you
from
ever
thinking
again
of
Philip
Wakem
as
a
lover
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
feel
certain
of
it
with
you
;
I
never
feel
certain
about
anything
with
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
At
one
time
you
take
pleasure
in
a
sort
of
perverse
self
-
denial
,
and
at
another
you
have
not
resolution
to
resist
a
thing
that
you
know
to
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
terrible
cutting
truth
in
Tom
's
words
,
 
that
hard
rind
of
truth
which
is
discerned
by
unimaginative
,
unsympathetic
minds
.
<EOS>
Maggie
always
writhed
under
this
judgment
of
Tom
's
;
she
rebelled
and
was
humiliated
in
the
same
moment
;
it
seemed
as
if
he
held
a
glass
before
her
to
show
her
her
own
folly
and
weakness
,
as
if
he
were
a
prophetic
voice
predicting
her
future
fallings
;
and
yet
,
all
the
while
,
she
judged
him
in
return
;
she
said
inwardly
that
he
was
narrow
and
unjust
,
that
he
was
below
feeling
those
mental
needs
which
were
often
the
source
of
the
wrong
-
doing
or
absurdity
that
made
her
life
a
planless
riddle
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
answer
directly
;
her
heart
was
too
full
,
and
she
sat
down
,
leaning
her
arm
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
use
trying
to
make
Tom
feel
that
she
was
near
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
always
repelled
her
.
<EOS>
Her
feeling
under
his
words
was
complicated
by
the
allusion
to
the
last
scene
between
her
father
and
Wakem
;
and
at
length
that
painful
,
solemn
memory
surmounted
the
immediate
grievance
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
She
did
not
think
of
such
things
with
frivolous
indifference
,
and
Tom
must
not
accuse
her
of
that
.
<EOS>
She
looked
up
at
him
with
a
grave
,
earnest
gaze
and
said
,
    
"
I
ca
n't
make
you
think
better
of
me
,
Tom
,
by
anything
I
can
say
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
so
shut
out
from
all
your
feelings
as
you
believe
me
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
see
as
well
as
you
do
that
from
our
position
with
regard
to
Philip
's
father
 
not
on
other
grounds
 
it
would
be
unreasonable
,
it
would
be
wrong
,
for
us
to
entertain
the
idea
of
marriage
;
and
I
have
given
up
thinking
of
him
as
a
lover
.
<EOS>
I
am
telling
you
the
truth
,
and
you
have
no
right
to
disbelieve
me
;
I
have
kept
my
word
to
you
,
and
you
have
never
detected
me
in
a
falsehood
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
only
not
encourage
,
I
should
carefully
avoid
,
any
intercourse
with
Philip
on
any
other
footing
than
of
quiet
friendship
.
<EOS>
You
may
think
that
I
am
unable
to
keep
my
resolutions
;
but
at
least
you
ought
not
to
treat
me
with
hard
contempt
on
the
ground
of
faults
that
I
have
not
committed
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Maggie
,
"
said
Tom
,
softening
under
this
appeal
,
"
I
do
n't
want
to
overstrain
matters
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
all
things
considered
,
it
will
be
best
for
you
to
see
Philip
Wakem
,
if
Lucy
wishes
him
to
come
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
believe
what
you
say
,
 
at
least
you
believe
it
yourself
,
I
know
;
I
can
only
warn
you
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
be
as
good
a
brother
to
you
as
you
will
let
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
tremor
in
Tom
's
voice
as
he
uttered
the
last
words
,
and
Maggie
's
ready
affection
came
back
with
as
sudden
a
glow
as
when
they
were
children
,
and
bit
their
cake
together
as
a
sacrament
of
conciliation
.
<EOS>
She
rose
and
laid
her
hand
on
Tom
's
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Tom
,
I
know
you
mean
to
be
good
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
have
had
a
great
deal
to
bear
,
and
have
done
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
be
a
comfort
to
you
,
not
to
vex
you
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
think
I
'm
altogether
naughty
,
now
,
do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
smiled
at
the
eager
face
;
his
smiles
were
very
pleasant
to
see
when
they
did
come
,
for
the
gray
eyes
could
be
tender
underneath
the
frown
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
turn
out
better
than
you
expect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
may
I
come
some
day
and
make
tea
for
you
,
and
see
this
extremely
small
wife
of
Bob
's
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
but
trot
away
now
,
for
I
've
no
more
time
to
spare
,
"
said
Tom
,
looking
at
his
watch
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
to
give
me
a
kiss
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
bent
to
kiss
her
cheek
,
and
then
said
,
    
"
There
!
<EOS>
Be
a
good
girl
.
<EOS>
I
've
got
a
great
deal
to
think
of
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
'm
going
to
have
a
long
consultation
with
my
uncle
Deane
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
come
to
aunt
Glegg
's
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
We
're
going
all
to
dine
early
,
that
we
may
go
there
to
tea
.
<EOS>
You
_
must
_
come
;
Lucy
told
me
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
pooh
!
<EOS>
I
've
plenty
else
to
do
,
"
said
Tom
,
pulling
his
bell
violently
,
and
bringing
down
the
small
bell
-
rope
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
frightened
;
I
shall
run
away
,
"
said
Maggie
,
making
a
laughing
retreat
;
while
Tom
,
with
masculine
philosophy
,
flung
the
bell
-
rope
to
the
farther
end
of
the
room
;
not
very
far
either
,
 
a
touch
of
human
experience
which
I
flatter
myself
will
come
home
to
the
bosoms
of
not
a
few
substantial
or
distinguished
men
who
were
once
at
an
early
stage
of
their
rise
in
the
world
,
and
were
cherishing
very
large
hopes
in
very
small
lodgings
.
    
<EOS>
Showing
That
Tom
Had
Opened
the
Oyster
  
"
<EOS>
And
now
we
've
settled
this
Newcastle
business
,
Tom
,
"
said
Mr.
Deane
,
that
same
afternoon
,
as
they
were
seated
in
the
private
room
at
the
Bank
together
<EOS>
,
"
there
's
another
matter
I
want
to
talk
to
you
about
.
<EOS>
Since
you
're
likely
to
have
rather
a
smoky
,
unpleasant
time
of
it
at
Newcastle
for
the
next
few
weeks
,
you
'll
want
a
good
prospect
of
some
sort
to
keep
up
your
spirits
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
waited
less
nervously
than
he
had
done
on
a
former
occasion
in
this
apartment
,
while
his
uncle
took
out
his
snuff
-
box
and
gratified
each
nostril
with
deliberate
impartiality
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Tom
,
"
said
Mr.
Deane
at
last
,
throwing
himself
backward
,
"
the
world
goes
on
at
a
smarter
pace
now
than
it
did
when
I
was
a
young
fellow
.
<EOS>
Why
,
sir
,
forty
years
ago
,
when
I
was
much
such
a
strapping
youngster
as
you
,
a
man
expected
to
pull
between
the
shafts
the
best
part
of
his
life
,
before
he
got
the
whip
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
The
looms
went
slowish
,
and
fashions
did
n't
alter
quite
so
fast
;
I
'd
a
best
suit
that
lasted
me
six
years
.
<EOS>
Everything
was
on
a
lower
scale
,
sir
,
 
in
point
of
expenditure
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
It
's
this
steam
,
you
see
,
that
has
made
the
difference
;
it
drives
on
every
wheel
double
pace
,
and
the
wheel
of
fortune
along
with
'em
,
as
our
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
said
at
the
anniversary
dinner
(
he
hits
these
things
off
wonderfully
,
considering
he
's
seen
nothing
of
business
)
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
find
fault
with
the
change
,
as
some
people
do
.
<EOS>
Trade
,
sir
,
opens
a
man
's
eyes
;
and
if
the
population
is
to
get
thicker
upon
the
ground
,
as
it
's
doing
,
the
world
must
use
its
wits
at
inventions
of
one
sort
or
other
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
've
done
my
share
as
an
ordinary
man
of
business
.
<EOS>
Somebody
has
said
it
's
a
fine
thing
to
make
two
ears
of
corn
grow
where
only
one
grew
before
;
but
,
sir
,
it
's
a
fine
thing
,
too
,
to
further
the
exchange
of
commodities
,
and
bring
the
grains
of
corn
to
the
mouths
that
are
hungry
.
<EOS>
And
that
's
our
line
of
business
;
and
I
consider
it
as
honorable
a
position
as
a
man
can
hold
,
to
be
connected
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
knew
that
the
affair
his
uncle
had
to
speak
of
was
not
urgent
;
Mr.
Deane
was
too
shrewd
and
practical
a
man
to
allow
either
his
reminiscences
or
his
snuff
to
impede
the
progress
of
trade
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
for
the
last
month
or
two
,
there
had
been
hints
thrown
out
to
Tom
which
enabled
him
to
guess
that
he
was
going
to
hear
some
proposition
for
his
own
benefit
.
<EOS>
With
the
beginning
of
the
last
speech
he
had
stretched
out
his
legs
,
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
prepared
himself
for
some
introductory
diffuseness
,
tending
to
show
that
Mr.
Deane
had
succeeded
by
his
own
merit
,
and
that
what
he
had
to
say
to
young
men
in
general
was
,
that
if
they
did
n't
succeed
too
it
was
because
of
their
own
demerit
.
<EOS>
He
was
rather
surprised
,
then
,
when
his
uncle
put
a
direct
question
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
,
 
it
's
going
on
for
seven
years
now
since
you
applied
to
me
for
a
situation
,
eh
,
Tom
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
;
I
'm
three
-
and
-
twenty
now
,
"
said
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
it
's
as
well
not
to
say
that
,
though
;
for
you
'd
pass
for
a
good
deal
older
,
and
age
tells
well
in
business
.
<EOS>
I
remember
your
coming
very
well
;
I
remember
I
saw
there
was
some
pluck
in
you
,
and
that
was
what
made
me
give
you
encouragement
.
<EOS>
And
I
'm
happy
to
say
I
was
right
;
I
'm
not
often
deceived
.
<EOS>
I
was
naturally
a
little
shy
at
pushing
my
nephew
,
but
I
'm
happy
to
say
you
've
done
me
credit
,
sir
;
and
if
I
'd
had
a
son
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
my
own
,
I
should
n't
have
been
sorry
to
see
him
like
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
tapped
his
box
and
opened
it
again
,
repeating
in
a
tone
of
some
feeling
,
"
No
,
I
should
n't
have
been
sorry
to
see
him
like
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
glad
I
've
given
you
satisfaction
,
sir
;
I
've
done
my
best
,
"
said
Tom
,
in
his
proud
,
independent
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Tom
,
you
've
given
me
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
speak
of
your
conduct
as
a
son
;
though
that
weighs
with
me
in
my
opinion
of
you
.
<EOS>
But
what
I
have
to
do
with
,
as
a
partner
in
our
firm
,
is
the
qualities
you
've
shown
as
a
man
o
'
business
.
<EOS>
Ours
is
a
fine
business
,
 
a
splendid
concern
,
sir
,
 
<EOS>
and
there
's
no
reason
why
it
should
n't
go
on
growing
<EOS>
;
there
's
a
growing
capital
,
and
growing
outlets
for
it
;
but
there
's
another
thing
that
's
wanted
for
the
prosperity
of
every
concern
,
large
or
small
,
and
that
's
men
to
conduct
it
,
 
men
of
the
right
habits
;
none
o
'
<EOS>
your
flashy
fellows
,
but
such
as
are
to
be
depended
on
.
<EOS>
Now
this
is
what
Mr.
Guest
and
I
see
clear
enough
.
<EOS>
Three
years
ago
we
took
Gell
into
the
concern
;
we
gave
him
a
share
in
the
oil
-
mill
.
<EOS>
And
why
?
<EOS>
Why
,
because
Gell
was
a
fellow
whose
services
were
worth
a
premium
.
<EOS>
So
it
will
always
be
,
sir
.
<EOS>
So
it
was
with
me
.
<EOS>
And
though
Gell
is
pretty
near
ten
years
older
than
you
,
there
are
other
points
in
your
favor
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
was
getting
a
little
nervous
as
Mr.
Deane
went
on
speaking
;
he
was
conscious
of
something
he
had
in
his
mind
to
say
,
which
might
not
be
agreeable
to
his
uncle
,
simply
because
it
was
a
new
suggestion
rather
than
an
acceptance
of
the
proposition
he
foresaw
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
stands
to
reason
,
"
Mr.
Deane
went
on
,
when
he
had
finished
his
new
pinch
,
"
that
your
being
my
nephew
weighs
in
your
favor
;
but
I
do
n't
deny
that
if
you
'd
been
no
relation
of
mine
at
all
,
your
conduct
in
that
affair
of
Pelley
's
bank
would
have
led
Mr.
Guest
and
myself
to
make
some
acknowledgment
of
the
service
you
've
been
to
us
;
and
,
backed
by
your
general
conduct
and
business
ability
,
it
has
made
us
determine
on
giving
you
a
share
in
the
business
,
 
<EOS>
a
share
which
we
shall
be
glad
to
increase
as
the
years
go
on
.
<EOS>
We
think
that
'll
be
better
,
on
all
grounds
,
than
raising
your
salary
.
<EOS>
It
'll
give
you
more
importance
,
and
prepare
you
better
for
taking
some
of
the
anxiety
off
my
shoulders
by
and
by
.
<EOS>
I
'm
equal
to
a
good
deal
o
'
work
at
present
,
thank
God
;
but
I
'm
getting
older
,
 
<EOS>
there
's
no
denying
that
.
<EOS>
I
told
Mr.
Guest
I
would
open
the
subject
to
you
;
and
when
you
come
back
from
this
northern
business
,
we
can
go
into
particulars
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
great
stride
for
a
young
fellow
of
three
-
and
-
twenty
,
but
I
'm
bound
to
say
you
've
deserved
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
grateful
to
Mr.
Guest
and
you
,
sir
;
of
course
I
feel
the
most
indebted
to
_
<EOS>
you
_
,
who
first
took
me
into
the
business
,
and
have
taken
a
good
deal
of
pains
with
me
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
spoke
with
a
slight
tremor
,
and
paused
after
he
had
said
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
said
Mr.
Deane
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
spare
pains
when
I
see
they
'll
be
of
any
use
.
<EOS>
I
gave
myself
some
trouble
with
Gell
,
else
he
would
n't
have
been
what
he
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
's
one
thing
I
should
like
to
mention
to
you
uncle
.
<EOS>
I
've
never
spoken
to
you
of
it
before
.
<EOS>
If
you
remember
,
at
the
time
my
father
's
property
was
sold
,
there
was
some
thought
of
your
firm
buying
the
Mill
;
I
know
you
thought
it
would
be
a
very
good
investment
,
especially
if
steam
were
applied
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
be
sure
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
But
Wakem
outbid
us
;
he
'd
made
up
his
mind
to
that
.
<EOS>
He
's
rather
fond
of
carrying
everything
over
other
people
's
heads
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
's
of
no
use
my
mentioning
it
at
present
,
"
Tom
went
on
,
"
but
I
wish
you
to
know
what
I
have
in
my
mind
about
the
Mill
.
<EOS>
I
've
a
strong
feeling
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
my
father
's
dying
wish
that
I
should
try
and
get
it
back
again
whenever
I
could
;
it
was
in
his
family
for
five
generations
.
<EOS>
I
promised
my
father
;
and
besides
that
,
I
'm
attached
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
like
any
other
so
well
.
<EOS>
And
if
it
should
ever
suit
your
views
to
buy
it
for
the
firm
,
I
should
have
a
better
chance
of
fulfilling
my
father
's
wish
.
<EOS>
I
should
n't
have
liked
to
mention
the
thing
to
you
,
only
you
've
been
kind
enough
to
say
my
services
have
been
of
some
value
.
<EOS>
And
I
'd
give
up
a
much
greater
chance
in
life
for
the
sake
of
having
the
Mill
again
,
 
I
mean
having
it
in
my
own
hands
,
and
gradually
working
off
the
price
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
had
listened
attentively
,
and
now
looked
thoughtful
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
I
see
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
while
;
"
the
thing
would
be
possible
if
there
were
any
chance
of
Wakem
's
parting
with
the
property
.
<EOS>
But
that
I
_
do
n't
_
see
.
<EOS>
He
's
put
that
young
Jetsome
in
the
place
;
and
he
had
his
reasons
when
he
bought
it
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
loose
fish
,
that
young
Jetsome
,
"
said
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
taking
to
drinking
,
and
they
say
he
's
letting
the
business
go
down
.
<EOS>
Luke
told
me
about
it
,
 
our
old
miller
.
<EOS>
He
says
he
sha'n"t
stay
unless
there
's
an
alteration
.
<EOS>
I
was
thinking
,
if
things
went
on
that
way
,
Wakem
might
be
more
willing
to
part
with
the
Mill
.
<EOS>
Luke
says
he
's
getting
very
sour
about
the
way
things
are
going
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'll
turn
it
over
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
I
must
inquire
into
the
matter
,
and
go
into
it
with
Mr.
Guest
.
<EOS>
But
,
you
see
,
it
's
rather
striking
out
a
new
branch
,
and
putting
you
to
that
,
instead
of
keeping
you
where
you
are
,
which
was
what
we
'd
wanted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
able
to
manage
more
than
the
Mill
when
things
were
once
set
properly
going
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
have
plenty
of
work
.
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
else
I
care
about
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
rather
sad
in
that
speech
from
a
young
man
of
three
-
and
-
twenty
,
even
in
uncle
Deane
's
business
-
loving
ears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
,
pooh
!
<EOS>
you
'll
be
having
a
wife
to
care
about
one
of
these
days
,
if
you
get
on
at
this
pace
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
But
as
to
this
Mill
,
we
must
n't
reckon
on
our
chickens
too
early
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
promise
you
to
bear
it
in
mind
,
and
when
you
come
back
we
'll
talk
of
it
again
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
dinner
now
.
<EOS>
Come
and
breakfast
with
us
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
say
good
-
bye
to
your
mother
and

Illustrating
the
Laws
of
Attraction
  
<EOS>
It
is
evident
to
you
now
that
Maggie
had
arrived
at
a
moment
in
her
life
which
must
be
considered
by
all
prudent
persons
as
a
great
opportunity
for
a
young
woman
.
<EOS>
Launched
into
the
higher
society
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
with
a
striking
person
,
which
had
the
advantage
of
being
quite
unfamiliar
to
the
majority
of
beholders
,
and
with
such
moderate
assistance
of
costume
as
you
have
seen
foreshadowed
in
Lucy
's
anxious
colloquy
with
aunt
Pullet
,
Maggie
was
certainly
at
a
new
starting
-
point
in
life
.
<EOS>
At
Lucy
's
first
evening
party
,
young
Torry
fatigued
his
facial
muscles
more
than
usual
in
order
that
"
the
dark
-
eyed
girl
there
in
the
corner
"
might
see
him
in
all
the
additional
style
conferred
by
his
eyeglass
;
and
several
young
ladies
went
home
intending
to
have
short
sleeves
with
black
lace
,
and
to
plait
their
hair
in
a
broad
coronet
at
the
back
of
their
head
,
 
"
That
cousin
of
Miss
Deane
's
looked
so
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
fact
,
poor
Maggie
,
with
all
her
inward
consciousness
of
a
painful
past
and
her
presentiment
of
a
troublous
future
,
was
on
the
way
to
become
an
object
of
some
envy
,
 
a
topic
of
discussion
in
the
newly
established
billiard
-
room
,
and
between
fair
friends
who
had
no
secrets
from
each
other
on
the
subject
of
trimmings
.
<EOS>
The
Miss
Guests
,
who
associated
chiefly
on
terms
of
condescension
with
the
families
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
were
the
glass
of
fashion
there
,
took
some
exception
to
Maggie
's
manners
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
way
of
not
assenting
at
once
to
the
observations
current
in
good
society
,
and
of
saying
that
she
did
n't
know
whether
those
observations
were
true
or
not
,
which
gave
her
an
air
of
_
gaucherie
_
,
and
impeded
the
even
flow
of
conversation
;
but
it
is
a
fact
capable
of
an
amiable
interpretation
that
ladies
are
not
the
worst
disposed
toward
a
new
acquaintance
of
their
own
sex
because
she
has
points
of
inferiority
.
<EOS>
And
Maggie
was
so
entirely
without
those
pretty
airs
of
coquetry
which
have
the
traditional
reputation
of
driving
gentlemen
to
despair
that
she
won
some
feminine
pity
for
being
so
ineffective
in
spite
of
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
had
many
advantages
,
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
and
it
must
be
admitted
there
was
no
pretension
about
her
;
her
abruptness
and
unevenness
of
manner
were
plainly
the
result
of
her
secluded
and
lowly
circumstances
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
a
wonder
that
there
was
no
tinge
of
vulgarity
about
her
,
considering
what
the
rest
of
poor
Lucy
's
relations
were
 
an
allusion
which
always
made
the
Miss
Guests
shudder
a
little
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
agreeable
to
think
of
any
connection
by
marriage
with
such
people
as
the
Gleggs
and
the
Pullets
;
but
it
was
of
no
use
to
contradict
Stephen
when
once
he
had
set
his
mind
on
anything
,
and
certainly
there
was
no
possible
objection
to
Lucy
in
herself
,
 
<EOS>
no
one
could
help
liking
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
naturally
desire
that
the
Miss
Guests
should
behave
kindly
to
this
cousin
of
whom
she
was
so
fond
,
and
Stephen
would
make
a
great
fuss
if
they
were
deficient
in
civility
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
the
invitations
to
Park
House
were
not
wanting
;
and
elsewhere
,
also
,
Miss
Deane
was
too
popular
and
too
distinguished
a
member
of
society
in
St.
Ogg
's
for
any
attention
toward
her
to
be
neglected
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
Maggie
was
introduced
for
the
first
time
to
the
young
lady
's
life
,
and
knew
what
it
was
to
get
up
in
the
morning
without
any
imperative
reason
for
doing
one
thing
more
than
another
.
<EOS>
This
new
sense
of
leisure
and
unchecked
enjoyment
amidst
the
soft
-
breathing
airs
and
garden
-
scents
of
advancing
spring
 
amidst
the
new
abundance
of
music
,
and
lingering
strolls
in
the
sunshine
,
and
the
delicious
dreaminess
of
gliding
on
the
river
 
could
hardly
be
without
some
intoxicating
effect
on
her
,
after
her
years
of
privation
;
and
even
in
the
first
week
Maggie
began
to
be
less
haunted
by
her
sad
memories
and
anticipations
.
<EOS>
Life
was
certainly
very
pleasant
just
now
;
it
was
becoming
very
pleasant
to
dress
in
the
evening
,
and
to
feel
that
she
was
one
of
the
beautiful
things
of
this
spring
-
time
.
<EOS>
And
there
were
admiring
eyes
always
awaiting
her
now
;
she
was
no
longer
an
unheeded
person
,
liable
to
be
chid
,
from
whom
attention
was
continually
claimed
,
and
on
whom
no
one
felt
bound
to
confer
any
.
<EOS>
It
was
pleasant
,
too
,
when
Stephen
and
Lucy
were
gone
out
riding
,
to
sit
down
at
the
piano
alone
,
and
find
that
the
old
fitness
between
her
fingers
and
the
keys
remained
,
and
revived
,
like
a
sympathetic
kinship
not
to
be
worn
out
by
separation
;
to
get
the
tunes
she
had
heard
the
evening
before
,
and
repeat
them
again
and
again
until
she
had
found
out
a
way
of
producing
them
so
as
to
make
them
a
more
pregnant
,
passionate
language
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
mere
concord
of
octaves
was
a
delight
to
Maggie
,
and
she
would
often
take
up
a
book
of
studies
rather
than
any
melody
,
that
she
might
taste
more
keenly
by
abstraction
the
more
primitive
sensation
of
intervals
.
<EOS>
Not
that
her
enjoyment
of
music
was
of
the
kind
that
indicates
a
great
specific
talent
;
it
was
rather
that
her
sensibility
to
the
supreme
excitement
of
music
was
only
one
form
of
that
passionate
sensibility
which
belonged
to
her
whole
nature
,
and
made
her
faults
and
virtues
all
merge
in
each
other
;
made
her
affections
sometimes
an
impatient
demand
,
but
also
prevented
her
vanity
from
taking
the
form
of
mere
feminine
coquetry
and
device
,
and
gave
it
the
poetry
of
ambition
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
known
Maggie
a
long
while
,
and
need
to
be
told
,
not
her
characteristics
,
but
her
history
,
which
is
a
thing
hardly
to
be
predicted
even
from
the
completest
knowledge
of
characteristics
.
<EOS>
For
the
tragedy
of
our
lives
is
not
created
entirely
from
within
.
<EOS>
"
Character
,
"
says
Novalis
,
in
one
of
his
questionable
aphorisms
,
 
"
character
is
destiny
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
not
the
whole
of
our
destiny
.
<EOS>
Hamlet
,
Prince
of
Denmark
,
was
speculative
and
irresolute
,
and
we
have
a
great
tragedy
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
But
if
his
father
had
lived
to
a
good
old
age
,
and
his
uncle
had
died
an
early
death
,
we
can
conceive
Hamlet
's
having
married
Ophelia
,
and
got
through
life
with
a
reputation
of
sanity
,
notwithstanding
many
soliloquies
,
and
some
moody
sarcasms
toward
the
fair
daughter
of
Polonius
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
frankest
incivility
to
his
father
-
in
-
law
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
destiny
,
then
,
is
at
present
hidden
,
and
we
must
wait
for
it
to
reveal
itself
like
the
course
of
an
unmapped
river
;
we
only
know
that
the
river
is
full
and
rapid
,
and
that
for
all
rivers
there
is
the
same
final
home
.
<EOS>
Under
the
charm
of
her
new
pleasures
,
Maggie
herself
was
ceasing
to
think
,
with
her
eager
prefiguring
imagination
,
of
her
future
lot
;
and
her
anxiety
about
her
first
interview
with
Philip
was
losing
its
predominance
;
perhaps
,
unconsciously
to
herself
,
she
was
not
sorry
that
the
interview
had
been
deferred
.
  
<EOS>
For
Philip
had
not
come
the
evening
he
was
expected
,
and
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
brought
word
that
he
was
gone
to
the
coast
,
 
probably
,
he
thought
,
on
a
sketching
expedition
;
but
it
was
not
certain
when
he
would
return
.
<EOS>
It
was
just
like
Philip
,
to
go
off
in
that
way
without
telling
any
one
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
the
twelfth
day
that
he
returned
,
to
find
both
Lucy
's
notes
awaiting
him
;
he
had
left
before
he
knew
of
Maggie
's
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
one
had
need
be
nineteen
again
to
be
quite
convinced
of
the
feelings
that
were
crowded
for
Maggie
into
those
twelve
days
;
of
the
length
to
which
they
were
stretched
for
her
by
the
novelty
of
her
experience
in
them
,
and
the
varying
attitudes
of
her
mind
.
<EOS>
The
early
days
of
an
acquaintance
almost
always
have
this
importance
for
us
,
and
fill
up
a
larger
space
in
our
memory
than
longer
subsequent
periods
,
which
have
been
less
filled
with
discovery
and
new
impressions
.
<EOS>
There
were
not
many
hours
in
those
ten
days
in
which
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
was
not
seated
by
Lucy
's
side
,
or
standing
near
her
at
the
piano
,
or
accompanying
her
on
some
outdoor
excursion
;
his
attentions
were
clearly
becoming
more
assiduous
,
and
that
was
what
every
one
had
expected
.
<EOS>
Lucy
was
very
happy
,
all
the
happier
because
Stephen
's
society
seemed
to
have
become
much
more
interesting
and
amusing
since
Maggie
had
been
there
.
<EOS>
Playful
discussions
 
<EOS>
sometimes
serious
ones
 
were
going
forward
,
in
which
both
Stephen
and
Maggie
revealed
themselves
,
to
the
admiration
of
the
gentle
,
unobtrusive
Lucy
;
and
it
more
than
once
crossed
her
mind
<EOS>
what
a
charming
quartet
they
should
have
through
life
when
Maggie
married
Philip
.
<EOS>
Is
it
an
inexplicable
thing
that
a
girl
should
enjoy
her
lover
's
society
the
more
for
the
presence
of
a
third
person
,
and
be
without
the
slightest
spasm
of
jealousy
that
the
third
person
had
the
conversation
habitually
directed
to
her
?
<EOS>
Not
when
that
girl
is
as
tranquil
-
hearted
as
Lucy
,
thoroughly
possessed
with
a
belief
that
she
knows
the
state
of
her
companions
'
affections
,
and
not
prone
to
the
feelings
which
shake
such
a
belief
in
the
absence
of
positive
evidence
against
it
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
was
Lucy
by
whom
Stephen
sat
,
to
whom
he
gave
his
arm
,
to
whom
he
appealed
as
the
person
sure
to
agree
with
him
;
and
every
day
there
was
the
same
tender
politeness
toward
her
,
the
same
consciousness
of
her
wants
and
care
to
supply
them
.
<EOS>
Was
there
really
the
same
?
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
Lucy
that
there
was
more
;
and
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
real
significance
of
the
change
escaped
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
subtle
act
of
conscience
in
Stephen
that
even
he
himself
was
not
aware
of
.
<EOS>
His
personal
attentions
to
Maggie
were
comparatively
slight
,
and
there
had
even
sprung
up
an
apparent
distance
between
them
,
that
prevented
the
renewal
of
that
faint
resemblance
to
gallantry
into
which
he
had
fallen
the
first
day
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
If
Stephen
came
in
when
Lucy
was
out
of
the
room
,
if
Lucy
left
them
together
,
they
never
spoke
to
each
other
;
Stephen
,
perhaps
,
seemed
to
be
examining
books
or
music
,
and
Maggie
bent
her
head
assiduously
over
her
work
.
<EOS>
Each
was
oppressively
conscious
of
the
other
's
presence
,
even
to
the
finger
-
ends
.
<EOS>
Yet
each
looked
and
longed
for
the
same
thing
to
happen
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
had
begun
to
reflect
on
the
matter
,
or
silently
to
ask
,
"
To
what
does
all
this
tend
?
"
<EOS>
Maggie
only
felt
that
life
was
revealing
something
quite
new
to
her
;
and
she
was
absorbed
in
the
direct
,
immediate
experience
,
without
any
energy
left
for
taking
account
of
it
and
reasoning
about
it
.
<EOS>
Stephen
wilfully
abstained
from
self
-
questioning
,
and
would
not
admit
to
himself
that
he
felt
an
influence
which
was
to
have
any
determining
effect
on
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
And
when
Lucy
came
into
the
room
again
,
they
were
once
more
unconstrained
;
Maggie
could
contradict
Stephen
,
and
laugh
at
him
,
and
he
could
recommend
to
her
consideration
the
example
of
that
most
charming
heroine
,
Miss
Sophia
Western
,
who
had
a
great
"
respect
for
the
understandings
of
men
.
<EOS>
"
Maggie
could
look
at
Stephen
,
which
,
for
some
reason
or
other
she
always
avoided
when
they
were
alone
;
and
he
could
even
ask
her
to
play
his
accompaniment
for
him
,
since
Lucy
's
fingers
were
so
busy
with
that
bazaar
-
work
,
and
lecture
her
on
hurrying
the
tempo
,
which
was
certainly
Maggie
's
weak
point
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
 
it
was
the
day
of
Philip
's
return
 
Lucy
had
formed
a
sudden
engagement
to
spend
the
evening
with
Mrs.
Kenn
,
whose
delicate
state
of
health
,
threatening
to
become
confirmed
illness
through
an
attack
of
bronchitis
,
obliged
her
to
resign
her
functions
at
the
coming
bazaar
into
the
hands
of
other
ladies
,
of
whom
she
wished
Lucy
to
be
one
.
<EOS>
The
engagement
had
been
formed
in
Stephen
's
presence
,
and
he
had
heard
Lucy
promise
to
dine
early
and
call
at
six
o'clock
for
Miss
Torry
,
who
brought
Mrs.
Kenn
's
request
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
is
another
of
the
moral
results
of
this
idiotic
bazaar
,
"
Stephen
burst
forth
,
as
soon
as
Miss
Torry
had
left
the
room
,
 
"
taking
young
ladies
from
the
duties
of
the
domestic
hearth
into
scenes
of
dissipation
among
urn
-
rugs
and
embroidered
reticules
!
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
know
what
is
the
proper
function
of
women
,
if
it
is
not
to
make
reasons
for
husbands
to
stay
at
home
,
and
still
stronger
reasons
for
bachelors
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
If
this
goes
on
much
longer
,
the
bonds
of
society
will
be
dissolved
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
will
not
go
on
much
longer
,
"
said
Lucy
,
laughing
,
"
for
the
bazaar
is
to
take
place
on
Monday
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Thank
Heaven
!
"
said
Stephen
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Kenn
himself
said
the
other
day
that
he
did
n't
like
this
plan
of
making
vanity
do
the
work
of
charity
;
but
just
as
the
British
public
is
not
reasonable
enough
to
bear
direct
taxation
,
so
St.
Ogg
's
has
not
got
force
of
motive
enough
to
build
and
endow
schools
without
calling
in
the
force
of
folly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
he
say
so
?
"
said
little
Lucy
,
her
<EOS>
hazel
eyes
opening
wide
with
anxiety
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
him
say
anything
of
that
kind
;
I
thought
he
approved
of
what
we
were
doing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
he
approves
_
you
_
,
"
said
Stephen
,
smiling
at
her
affectionately
;
"
your
conduct
in
going
out
to
-
night
looks
vicious
,
I
own
,
but
<EOS>
I
know
there
is
benevolence
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
think
too
well
of
me
,
"
said
Lucy
,
shaking
her
head
,
with
a
pretty
blush
,
and
there
the
subject
ended
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
tacitly
understood
that
Stephen
would
not
come
in
the
evening
;
and
on
the
strength
of
that
tacit
understanding
he
made
his
morning
visit
the
longer
,
not
saying
good
-
bye
until
after
four
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
was
seated
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
alone
,
shortly
after
dinner
,
with
Minny
on
her
lap
,
having
left
her
uncle
to
his
wine
and
his
nap
,
and
her
mother
to
the
compromise
between
knitting
and
nodding
,
which
,
when
there
was
no
company
,
she
always
carried
on
in
the
dining
-
room
till
tea
-
time
.
<EOS>
Maggie
was
stooping
to
caress
the
tiny
silken
pet
,
and
comforting
him
for
his
mistress
's
absence
,
when
the
sound
of
a
footstep
on
the
gravel
made
her
look
up
,
and
she
saw
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
walking
up
the
garden
,
as
if
he
had
come
straight
from
the
river
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
unusual
to
see
him
so
soon
after
dinner
!
<EOS>
He
often
complained
that
their
dinner
-
hour
was
late
at
Park
House
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
there
he
was
,
in
his
black
dress
;
he
had
evidently
been
home
,
and
must
have
come
again
by
the
river
.
<EOS>
Maggie
felt
her
cheeks
glowing
and
her
heart
beating
;
it
was
natural
she
should
be
nervous
,
for
she
was
not
accustomed
to
receive
visitors
alone
.
<EOS>
He
had
seen
her
look
up
through
the
open
window
,
and
raised
his
hat
as
he
walked
toward
it
,
to
enter
that
way
instead
of
by
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
blushed
too
,
and
certainly
looked
as
foolish
as
a
young
man
of
some
wit
and
self
-
possession
can
be
expected
to
look
,
as
he
walked
in
with
a
roll
of
music
in
his
hand
,
and
said
,
with
an
air
of
hesitating
improvisation
,
    
<EOS>
"
You
are
surprised
to
see
me
again
,
Miss
Tulliver
;
I
ought
to
apologize
for
coming
upon
you
by
surprise
,
but
I
wanted
to
come
into
the
town
,
and
I
got
our
man
to
row
me
;
so
I
thought
I
would
bring
these
things
from
the
"
Maid
of
Artois
"
for
your
cousin
;
I
forgot
them
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Will
you
give
them
to
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Maggie
,
who
had
risen
confusedly
with
Minny
in
her
arms
,
and
now
,
not
quite
knowing
what
else
to
do
,
sat
down
again
.
  
<EOS>
Stephen
laid
down
his
hat
,
with
the
music
,
which
rolled
on
the
floor
,
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
close
by
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
done
so
before
,
and
both
he
and
Maggie
were
quite
aware
that
it
was
an
entirely
new
position
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
pampered
minion
!
"
said
Stephen
,
leaning
to
pull
the
long
curly
ears
that
drooped
over
Maggie
's
arm
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
suggestive
remark
,
and
as
the
speaker
did
not
follow
it
up
by
further
development
,
it
naturally
left
the
conversation
at
a
standstill
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
Stephen
like
some
action
in
a
dream
that
he
was
obliged
to
do
,
and
wonder
at
himself
all
the
while
,
 
to
go
on
stroking
Minny
's
head
.
<EOS>
Yet
it
was
very
pleasant
;
he
only
wished
he
dared
look
at
Maggie
,
and
that
she
would
look
at
him
,
 
<EOS>
let
him
have
one
long
look
into
those
deep
,
strange
eyes
of
hers
,
and
then
he
would
be
satisfied
and
quite
reasonable
after
that
.
<EOS>
He
thought
it
was
becoming
a
sort
of
monomania
with
him
,
to
want
that
long
look
from
Maggie
;
and
he
was
racking
his
invention
continually
to
find
out
some
means
by
which
he
could
have
it
without
its
appearing
singular
and
entailing
subsequent
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
As
for
Maggie
,
she
had
no
distinct
thought
,
only
the
sense
of
a
presence
like
that
of
a
closely
hovering
broad
-
winged
bird
in
the
darkness
,
for
she
was
unable
to
look
up
,
and
saw
nothing
but
Minny
's
black
wavy
coat
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
must
end
some
time
<EOS>
,
perhaps
it
ended
very
soon
,
and
only
_
seemed
_
long
,
as
a
minute
's
dream
does
.
<EOS>
Stephen
at
last
sat
upright
sideways
in
his
chair
,
leaning
one
hand
and
arm
over
the
back
and
looking
at
Maggie
.
<EOS>
What
should
he
say
?
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
a
splendid
sunset
,
I
think
;
sha'n"t
<EOS>
you
go
out
and
see
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Maggie
.
<EOS>
Then
courageously
raising
her
eyes
and
looking
out
of
the
window
,
"
if
I
'm
not
playing
cribbage
with
my
uncle
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
pause
;
during
which
Minny
is
stroked
again
,
but
has
sufficient
insight
not
to
be
grateful
for
it
,
to
growl
rather
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
like
sitting
alone
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
rather
arch
look
came
over
Maggie
's
face
,
and
,
just
glancing
at
Stephen
,
she
said
,
"
Would
it
be
quite
civil
to
say've
s
"
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
It
<EOS>
_
was
_
rather
a
dangerous
question
for
an
intruder
to
ask
,
"
said
Stephen
,
delighted
with
that
glance
,
and
getting
determined
to
stay
for
another
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
have
more
than
half
an
hour
to
yourself
after
I
am
gone
,
"
he
added
,
taking
out
his
watch
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
Mr.
Deane
never
comes
in
till
half
-
past
seven
.
"
  
<EOS>
Another
pause
,
during
which
Maggie
looked
steadily
out
of
the
window
,
till
by
a
great
effort
she
moved
her
head
to
look
down
at
Minny
's
back
again
,
and
said
,
    
"
I
wish
Lucy
had
not
been
obliged
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
We
lose
our
music
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
a
new
voice
to
-
morrow
night
,
"
said
Stephen
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
tell
your
cousin
that
our
friend
Philip
Wakem
is
come
back
?
<EOS>
I
saw
him
as
I
went
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
gave
a
little
start
,
 
it
seemed
hardly
more
than
a
vibration
that
passed
from
head
to
foot
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
But
the
new
images
summoned
by
Philip
's
name
dispersed
half
the
oppressive
spell
she
had
been
under
.
<EOS>
She
rose
from
her
chair
with
a
sudden
resolution
,
and
laying
Minny
on
his
cushion
,
went
to
reach
Lucy
's
large
work
-
basket
from
its
corner
.
<EOS>
Stephen
was
vexed
and
disappointed
;
he
thought
perhaps
Maggie
did
n't
like
the
name
of
Wakem
to
be
mentioned
to
her
in
that
abrupt
way
,
for
he
now
recalled
what
Lucy
had
told
him
of
the
family
quarrel
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
no
use
to
stay
any
longer
.
<EOS>
Maggie
was
seating
herself
at
the
table
with
her
work
,
and
looking
chill
and
proud
;
and
he
 
<EOS>
he
looked
like
a
simpleton
for
having
come
.
<EOS>
A
gratuitous
,
entirely
superfluous
visit
of
that
sort
was
sure
to
make
a
man
disagreeable
and
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
Of
course
it
was
palpable
to
Maggie
's
thinking
that
he
had
dined
hastily
in
his
own
room
for
the
sake
of
setting
off
again
and
finding
her
alone
.
  
<EOS>
A
boyish
state
of
mind
for
an
accomplished
young
gentleman
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
not
without
legal
knowledge
!
<EOS>
But
a
reference
to
history
,
perhaps
,
may
make
it
not
incredible
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Maggie
's
ball
of
knitting
-
wool
rolled
along
the
ground
,
and
she
started
up
to
reach
it
.
<EOS>
Stephen
rose
too
,
and
picking
up
the
ball
,
met
her
with
a
vexed
,
complaining
look
that
gave
his
eyes
quite
a
new
expression
to
Maggie
,
whose
own
eyes
met
them
as
he
presented
the
ball
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
"
said
Stephen
,
in
a
tone
that
had
the
same
beseeching
discontent
as
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
dared
not
put
out
his
hand
;
he
thrust
both
hands
into
his
tail
-
pockets
as
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
Maggie
thought
she
had
perhaps
been
rude
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
stay
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
timidly
,
not
looking
away
,
for
that
would
have
seemed
rude
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
,
"
said
Stephen
,
looking
still
into
the
half
-
unwilling
,
half
-
fascinated
eyes
,
as
a
thirsty
man
looks
toward
the
track
of
the
distant
brook
.
<EOS>
"
The
boat
is
waiting
for
me
.
<EOS>
You
'll
tell
your
cousin
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
brought
the
music
,
I
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
"
And
that
Philip
is
come
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
<EOS>
(
Maggie
did
not
notice
Philip
's
name
this
time
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
come
out
a
little
way
into
the
garden
?
"
said
Stephen
,
in
a
still
gentler
tone
;
but
the
next
moment
he
was
vexed
that
she
did
not
say
"
No
,
"
<EOS>
for
she
moved
away
now
toward
the
open
window
,
and
he
was
obliged
to
take
his
hat
and
walk
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
But
he
thought
of
something
to
make
him
amends
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
take
my
arm
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
low
tone
,
as
if
it
were
a
secret
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
something
strangely
winning
to
most
women
in
that
offer
of
the
firm
arm
;
the
help
is
not
wanted
physically
at
that
moment
,
but
the
sense
of
help
,
the
presence
of
strength
that
is
outside
them
and
yet
theirs
,
meets
a
continual
want
of
the
imagination
.
<EOS>
Either
on
that
ground
or
some
other
,
Maggie
took
the
arm
.
<EOS>
And
they
walked
together
round
the
grassplot
and
under
the
drooping
green
of
the
laburnums
,
in
the
same
dim
,
dreamy
state
as
they
had
been
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
;
only
that
Stephen
had
had
the
look
he
longed
for
,
without
yet
perceiving
in
himself
the
symptoms
of
returning
reasonableness
,
and
Maggie
had
darting
thoughts
across
the
dimness
,
 
<EOS>
how
came
he
to
be
there
?
<EOS>
Why
had
she
come
out
?
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
spoken
.
<EOS>
If
it
had
been
,
each
would
have
been
less
intensely
conscious
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
care
of
this
step
,
"
said
Stephen
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
will
go
in
now
,
"
said
Maggie
,
feeling
that
the
step
had
come
like
a
rescue
.
<EOS>
"
Good
-
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
an
instant
she
had
withdrawn
her
arm
,
and
was
running
back
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
reflect
that
this
sudden
action
would
only
add
to
the
embarrassing
recollections
of
the
last
half
-
hour
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
thought
left
for
that
.
<EOS>
She
only
threw
herself
into
the
low
arm
-
chair
,
and
burst
into
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Philip
,
Philip
,
I
wish
we
were
together
again
 
so
quietly
 
in
the
Red
Deeps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
looked
after
her
a
moment
,
then
went
on
to
the
boat
,
and
was
soon
landed
at
the
wharf
.
<EOS>
He
spent
the
evening
in
the
billiard
-
room
,
smoking
one
cigar
after
another
,
and
losing
"
lives
"
at
pool
.
<EOS>
But
he
would
not
leave
off
.
<EOS>
He
was
determined
not
to
think
,
 
not
to
admit
any
more
distinct
remembrance
than
was
urged
upon
him
by
the
perpetual
presence
of
Maggie
.
<EOS>
He
was
looking
at
her
,
and
she
was
on
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
came
the
necessity
of
walking
home
in
the
cool
starlight
,
and
with
it
the
necessity
of
cursing
his
own
folly
,
and
bitterly
determining
that
he
would
never
trust
himself
alone
with
Maggie
again
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
madness
;
he
was
in
love
,
thoroughly
attached
to
Lucy
,
and
engaged
,
 
engaged
as
strongly
as
an
honorable
man
need
be
.
<EOS>
He
wished
he
had
never
seen
this
Maggie
Tulliver
,
to
be
thrown
into
a
fever
by
her
in
this
way
;
she
would
make
a
sweet
,
strange
,
troublesome
,
adorable
wife
to
some
man
or
other
,
but
he
would
never
have
chosen
her
himself
.
<EOS>
Did
she
feel
as
he
did
?
<EOS>
He
hoped
she
did
 
not
.
<EOS>
He
ought
not
to
have
gone
.
<EOS>
He
would
master
himself
in
future
.
<EOS>
He
would
make
himself
disagreeable
to
her
,
quarrel
with
her
perhaps
.
<EOS>
Quarrel
with
her
?
<EOS>
Was
it
possible
to
quarrel
with
a
creature
who
had
such
eyes
,
 
defying
and
deprecating
,
contradicting
and
clinging
,
imperious
and
beseeching
,
  
full
of
delicious
opposites
?
<EOS>
To
see
such
a
creature
subdued
by
love
for
one
would
be
a
lot
worth
having
 
to
another
man
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
muttered
exclamation
which
ended
this
inward
soliloquy
,
as
Stephen
threw
away
the
end
of
his
last
cigar
,
and
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
stalked
along
at
a
quieter
pace
through
the
shrubbery
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
of
a
benedictory
kind
.
    
<EOS>
Philip
Re
-
enters
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
was
very
wet
,
 
the
sort
of
morning
on
which
male
neighbors
who
have
no
imperative
occupation
at
home
are
likely
to
pay
their
fair
friends
an
illimitable
visit
.
<EOS>
The
rain
,
which
has
been
endurable
enough
for
the
walk
or
ride
one
way
,
is
sure
to
become
so
heavy
,
and
at
the
same
time
so
certain
to
clear
up
by
and
by
,
that
nothing
but
an
open
quarrel
can
abbreviate
the
visit
;
latent
detestation
will
not
do
at
all
.
<EOS>
And
if
people
happen
to
be
lovers
,
what
can
be
so
delightful
,
in
England
,
as
a
rainy
morning
?
<EOS>
English
sunshine
is
dubious
;
bonnets
are
never
quite
secure
;
and
if
you
sit
down
on
the
grass
,
it
may
lead
to
catarrhs
.
<EOS>
But
the
rain
is
to
be
depended
on
.
<EOS>
You
gallop
through
it
in
a
mackintosh
,
and
presently
find
yourself
in
the
seat
you
like
best
,
 
a
little
above
or
a
little
below
the
one
on
which
your
goddess
sits
<EOS>
(
it
is
the
same
thing
to
the
metaphysical
mind
,
and
that
is
the
reason
why
women
are
at
once
worshipped
and
looked
down
upon
)
,
with
a
satisfactory
confidence
that
there
will
be
no
lady
-
callers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stephen
will
come
earlier
this
morning
,
I
know
,
"
said
Lucy
;
"
he
always
does
when
it
's
rainy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
made
no
answer
.
<EOS>
She
was
angry
with
Stephen
;
she
began
to
think
she
should
dislike
him
;
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
rain
,
she
would
have
gone
to
her
aunt
<EOS>
Glegg
's
this
morning
,
and
so
have
avoided
him
altogether
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
she
must
find
some
reason
for
remaining
out
of
the
room
with
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
But
Stephen
did
not
come
earlier
,
and
there
was
another
visitor
 
a
nearer
neighbor
 
who
preceded
him
.
<EOS>
When
Philip
entered
the
room
,
he
was
going
merely
to
bow
to
Maggie
,
feeling
that
their
acquaintance
was
a
secret
which
he
was
bound
not
to
betray
;
but
when
she
advanced
toward
him
and
put
out
her
hand
,
he
guessed
at
once
that
Lucy
had
been
taken
into
her
confidence
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
moment
of
some
agitation
to
both
,
though
Philip
had
spent
many
hours
in
preparing
for
it
;
but
like
all
persons
who
have
passed
through
life
with
little
expectation
of
sympathy
,
he
seldom
lost
his
self
-
control
,
and
shrank
with
the
most
sensitive
pride
from
any
noticeable
betrayal
of
emotion
.
<EOS>
A
little
extra
paleness
,
a
little
tension
of
the
nostril
when
he
spoke
,
and
the
voice
pitched
in
rather
a
higher
key
,
that
to
strangers
would
seem
expressive
of
cold
indifference
,
were
all
the
signs
Philip
usually
gave
of
an
inward
drama
that
was
not
without
its
fierceness
.
<EOS>
But
Maggie
,
who
had
little
more
power
of
concealing
the
impressions
made
upon
her
than
if
she
had
been
constructed
of
musical
strings
,
felt
her
eyes
getting
larger
with
tears
as
they
took
each
other
's
hands
in
silence
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
painful
tears
;
they
had
rather
something
of
the
same
origin
as
the
tears
women
and
children
shed
when
they
have
found
some
protection
to
cling
to
and
look
back
on
the
threatened
danger
.
<EOS>
For
Philip
,
who
a
little
while
ago
was
associated
continually
in
Maggie
's
mind
with
the
sense
that
Tom
might
reproach
her
with
some
justice
,
had
now
,
in
this
short
space
,
become
a
sort
of
outward
conscience
to
her
,
that
she
might
fly
to
for
rescue
and
strength
.
<EOS>
Her
tranquil
,
tender
affection
for
Philip
,
with
its
root
deep
down
in
her
childhood
,
and
its
memories
of
long
quiet
talk
confirming
by
distinct
successive
impressions
the
first
instinctive
bias
,
 
the
fact
that
in
him
the
appeal
was
more
strongly
to
her
pity
and
womanly
devotedness
than
to
her
vanity
or
other
egoistic
excitability
of
her
nature
,
 
seemed
now
to
make
a
sort
of
sacred
place
,
a
sanctuary
where
she
could
find
refuge
from
an
alluring
influence
which
the
best
part
of
herself
must
resist
;
which
must
bring
horrible
tumult
within
,
wretchedness
without
.
<EOS>
This
new
sense
of
her
relation
to
Philip
nullified
the
anxious
scruples
she
would
otherwise
have
felt
,
lest
she
should
overstep
the
limit
of
intercourse
with
him
that
Tom
would
sanction
;
and
she
put
out
her
hand
to
him
,
and
felt
the
tears
in
her
eyes
without
any
consciousness
of
an
inward
check
.
<EOS>
The
scene
was
just
what
Lucy
expected
,
and
her
kind
heart
delighted
in
bringing
Philip
and
Maggie
together
again
;
though
,
even
with
all
_
her
_
regard
for
Philip
,
she
could
not
resist
the
impression
that
her
cousin
Tom
had
some
excuse
for
feeling
shocked
at
the
physical
incongruity
between
the
two
,
 
a
prosaic
person
like
cousin
Tom
,
who
did
n't
like
poetry
and
fairy
tales
.
<EOS>
But
she
began
to
speak
as
soon
as
possible
,
to
set
them
at
ease
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
was
very
good
and
virtuous
of
you
,
"
she
said
,
in
her
pretty
treble
,
like
the
low
conversational
notes
of
little
birds
,
"
to
come
so
soon
after
your
arrival
.
<EOS>
And
as
it
is
,
I
think
I
will
pardon
you
for
running
away
in
an
inopportune
manner
,
and
giving
your
friends
no
notice
.
<EOS>
Come
and
sit
down
here
,
"
she
went
on
,
placing
the
chair
that
would
suit
him
best
,
"
and
you
shall
find
yourself
treated
mercifully
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
never
govern
well
,
Miss
Deane
,
"
said
Philip
,
as
he
seated
himself
,
"
because
no
one
will
ever
believe
in
your
severity
.
<EOS>
People
will
always
encourage
themselves
in
misdemeanors
by
the
certainty
that
you
will
be
indulgent
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
gave
some
playful
contradiction
,
but
Philip
did
not
hear
what
it
was
,
for
he
had
naturally
turned
toward
Maggie
,
and
she
was
looking
at
him
with
that
open
,
affectionate
scrutiny
which
we
give
to
a
friend
from
whom
we
have
been
long
separated
.
<EOS>
What
a
moment
their
parting
had
been
!
<EOS>
And
Philip
felt
as
if
he
were
only
in
the
morrow
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
felt
this
so
keenly
,
 
with
such
intense
,
detailed
remembrance
,
with
such
passionate
revival
of
all
that
had
been
said
and
looked
in
their
last
conversation
,
 
that
with
that
jealousy
and
distrust
which
in
diffident
natures
is
almost
inevitably
linked
with
a
strong
feeling
,
he
thought
he
read
in
Maggie
's
glance
and
manner
the
evidence
of
a
change
.
<EOS>
The
very
fact
that
he
feared
and
half
expected
it
would
be
sure
to
make
this
thought
rush
in
,
in
the
absence
of
positive
proof
to
the
contrary
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
having
a
great
holiday
,
am
I
not
?
"
said
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
Lucy
is
like
a
fairy
godmother
;
she
has
turned
me
from
a
drudge
into
a
princess
in
no
time
.
<EOS>
I
do
nothing
but
indulge
myself
all
day
long
,
and
she
always
finds
out
what
I
want
before
I
know
it
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
she
is
the
happier
for
having
you
,
then
,
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
better
than
a
whole
menagerie
of
pets
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
you
look
well
.
<EOS>
You
are
benefiting
by
the
change
.
"
  
<EOS>
Artificial
conversation
of
this
sort
went
on
a
little
while
,
till
Lucy
,
determined
to
put
an
end
to
it
,
exclaimed
,
with
a
good
imitation
of
annoyance
,
that
she
had
forgotten
something
,
and
was
quickly
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
moment
Maggie
and
Philip
leaned
forward
,
and
the
hands
were
clasped
again
,
with
a
look
of
sad
contentment
,
like
that
of
friends
who
meet
in
the
memory
of
recent
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
my
brother
<EOS>
I
wished
to
see
you
,
Philip
;
I
asked
him
to
release
me
from
my
promise
,
and
he
consented
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
,
in
her
impulsiveness
,
wanted
Philip
to
know
at
once
the
position
they
must
hold
toward
each
other
;
but
she
checked
herself
.
<EOS>
The
things
that
had
happened
since
he
had
spoken
of
his
love
for
her
were
so
painful
that
she
shrank
from
being
the
first
to
allude
to
them
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
almost
like
an
injury
toward
Philip
even
to
mention
her
brother
,
 
her
brother
,
who
had
insulted
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
thinking
too
entirely
of
her
to
be
sensitive
on
any
other
point
at
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
we
can
at
least
be
friends
,
Maggie
?
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
to
hinder
that
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
not
your
father
object
?
"
said
Maggie
,
withdrawing
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
give
you
up
on
any
ground
but
your
own
wish
,
Maggie
,
"
said
Philip
,
coloring
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
points
on
which
I
should
always
resist
my
father
,
as
I
used
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
That
_
is
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
there
is
nothing
to
hinder
our
being
friends
,
Philip
,
 
seeing
each
other
and
talking
to
each
other
while
I
am
here
;
I
shall
soon
go
away
again
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
go
very
soon
,
to
a
new
situation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
inevitable
,
Maggie
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
must
not
stay
here
long
.
<EOS>
It
would
unfit
me
for
the
life
I
must
begin
again
at
last
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
live
in
dependence
,
 
I
ca
n't
live
with
my
brother
,
though
he
is
very
good
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
would
like
to
provide
for
me
;
but
that
would
be
intolerable
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
was
silent
a
few
moments
,
and
then
said
,
in
that
high
,
feeble
voice
which
with
him
indicated
the
resolute
suppression
of
emotion
,
    
"
Is
there
no
other
alternative
,
Maggie
?
<EOS>
Is
that
life
,
away
from
those
who
love
you
,
the
only
one
you
will
allow
yourself
to
look
forward
to
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Philip
,
"
she
said
,
looking
at
him
pleadingly
,
as
if
she
entreated
him
to
believe
that
she
was
compelled
to
this
course
.
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
as
things
are
;
I
do
n't
know
what
may
be
in
years
to
come
.
<EOS>
But
I
begin
to
think
there
can
never
come
much
happiness
to
me
from
loving
;
I
have
always
had
so
much
pain
mingled
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
make
myself
a
world
outside
it
,
as
men
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
you
are
returning
to
your
old
thought
in
a
new
form
,
Maggie
,
 
the
thought
I
used
to
combat
,
"
said
Philip
,
with
a
slight
tinge
of
bitterness
.
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
find
out
a
mode
of
renunciation
that
will
be
an
escape
from
pain
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
again
,
there
is
no
such
escape
possible
except
by
perverting
or
mutilating
one
's
nature
.
<EOS>
What
would
become
of
me
,
if
I
tried
to
escape
from
pain
?
<EOS>
Scorn
and
cynicism
would
be
my
only
opium
;
unless
I
could
fall
into
some
kind
of
conceited
madness
,
and
fancy
myself
a
favorite
of
Heaven
because
I
am
not
a
favorite
with
men
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
bitterness
had
taken
on
some
impetuosity
as
Philip
went
on
speaking
;
the
words
were
evidently
an
outlet
for
some
immediate
feeling
of
his
own
,
as
well
as
an
answer
to
Maggie
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
pain
pressing
on
him
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
He
shrank
with
proud
delicacy
from
the
faintest
allusion
to
the
words
of
love
,
of
plighted
love
that
had
passed
between
them
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
seemed
to
him
like
reminding
Maggie
of
a
promise
;
it
would
have
had
for
him
something
of
the
baseness
of
compulsion
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
dwell
on
the
fact
that
he
himself
had
not
changed
;
for
that
too
would
have
had
the
air
of
an
appeal
.
<EOS>
His
love
for
Maggie
was
stamped
,
even
more
than
the
rest
of
his
experience
,
with
the
exaggerated
sense
that
he
was
an
exception
,
 
that
she
,
that
every
one
,
saw
him
in
the
light
of
an
exception
.
  
<EOS>
But
Maggie
was
conscience
-
stricken
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Philip
,
"
she
said
,
with
her
childish
contrition
when
he
used
to
chide
her
,
"
you
are
right
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
I
do
always
think
too
much
of
my
own
feelings
,
and
not
enough
of
others
"
,
 
not
enough
of
yours
.
<EOS>
I
had
need
have
you
always
to
find
fault
with
me
and
teach
me
;
so
many
things
have
come
true
that
you
used
to
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
was
resting
her
elbow
on
the
table
,
leaning
her
head
on
her
hand
and
looking
at
Philip
with
half
-
penitent
dependent
affection
,
as
she
said
this
;
while
he
was
returning
her
gaze
with
an
expression
that
,
to
her
consciousness
,
gradually
became
less
vague
,
 
became
charged
with
a
specific
recollection
.
<EOS>
Had
his
mind
flown
back
to
something
that
_
she
_
now
remembered
,
 
something
about
a
lover
of
Lucy
's
?
<EOS>
It
was
a
thought
that
made
her
shudder
;
it
gave
new
definiteness
to
her
present
position
,
and
to
the
tendency
of
what
had
happened
the
evening
before
.
<EOS>
She
moved
her
arm
from
the
table
,
urged
to
change
her
position
by
that
positive
physical
oppression
at
the
heart
that
sometimes
accompanies
a
sudden
mental
pang
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
,
Maggie
?
<EOS>
Has
something
happened
?
"
<EOS>
Philip
said
,
in
inexpressible
anxiety
,
his
imagination
being
only
too
ready
to
weave
everything
that
was
fatal
to
them
both
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
nothing
,
"
said
Maggie
,
rousing
her
latent
will
.
<EOS>
Philip
must
not
have
that
odious
thought
in
his
mind
;
she
would
banish
it
from
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
she
repeated
,
"
except
in
my
own
mind
.
<EOS>
You
used
to
say
I
should
feel
the
effect
of
my
starved
life
,
as
you
called
it
;
and
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
am
too
eager
in
my
enjoyment
of
music
and
all
luxuries
,
now
they
are
come
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
took
up
her
work
and
occupied
herself
resolutely
,
while
Philip
watched
her
,
really
in
doubt
whether
she
had
anything
more
than
this
general
allusion
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
in
Maggie
's
character
to
be
agitated
by
vague
self
-
reproach
.
<EOS>
But
soon
there
came
a
violent
well
-
known
ring
at
the
door
-
bell
resounding
through
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
a
startling
announcement
!
<EOS>
"
said
Maggie
,
quite
mistress
of
herself
,
though
not
without
some
inward
flutter
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
where
Lucy
is
.
"
  
Lucy
had
not
been
deaf
to
the
signal
,
and
after
an
interval
long
enough
for
a
few
solicitous
but
not
hurried
inquiries
,
she
herself
ushered
Stephen
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
old
fellow
,
"
he
said
,
going
straight
up
to
Philip
and
shaking
him
heartily
by
the
hand
,
bowing
to
Maggie
in
passing
,
"
it
's
glorious
to
have
you
back
again
;
only
I
wish
you
'd
conduct
yourself
a
little
less
like
a
sparrow
with
a
residence
on
the
house
-
top
,
and
not
go
in
and
out
constantly
without
letting
the
servants
know
.
<EOS>
This
is
about
the
twentieth
time
I
've
had
to
scamper
up
those
countless
stairs
to
that
painting
-
room
of
yours
,
all
to
no
purpose
,
because
your
people
thought
you
were
at
home
.
<EOS>
Such
incidents
embitter
friendship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
so
few
visitors
,
it
seems
hardly
worth
while
to
leave
notice
of
my
exit
and
entrances
,
"
said
Philip
,
feeling
rather
oppressed
just
then
by
Stephen
's
bright
strong
presence
and
strong
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
quite
well
this
morning
,
Miss
Tulliver
?
"
said
Stephen
,
turning
to
Maggie
with
stiff
politeness
,
and
putting
out
his
hand
with
the
air
of
fulfilling
a
social
duty
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
gave
the
tips
of
her
fingers
,
and
said
,
"
Quite
well
,
thank
you
,
"
in
a
tone
of
proud
indifference
.
<EOS>
Philip
's
eyes
were
watching
them
keenly
;
but
Lucy
was
used
to
seeing
variations
in
their
manner
to
each
other
,
and
only
thought
with
regret
that
there
was
some
natural
antipathy
which
every
now
and
then
surmounted
their
mutual
good
-
will
.
<EOS>
"
Maggie
is
not
the
sort
of
woman
Stephen
admires
,
and
she
is
irritated
by
something
in
him
which
she
interprets
as
conceit
,
"
was
the
silent
observation
that
accounted
for
everything
to
guileless
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Stephen
and
Maggie
had
no
sooner
completed
this
studied
greeting
than
each
felt
hurt
by
the
other
's
coldness
.
<EOS>
And
Stephen
,
while
rattling
on
in
questions
to
Philip
about
his
recent
sketching
expedition
,
was
thinking
all
the
more
about
Maggie
because
he
was
not
drawing
her
into
the
conversation
as
he
had
invariably
done
before
.
<EOS>
"
Maggie
and
Philip
are
not
looking
happy
,
"
thought
Lucy
;
"
this
first
interview
has
been
saddening
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
people
who
have
not
been
galloping
,
"
she
said
to
Stephen
,
"
are
all
a
little
damped
by
the
rain
.
<EOS>
Let
us
have
some
music
.
<EOS>
We
ought
to
take
advantage
of
having
Philip
and
you
together
.
<EOS>
Give
us
the
duet
in
"
Masaniello
"
<EOS>
;
Maggie
has
not
heard
that
,
and
I
know
it
will
suit
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
then
,
"
said
Stephen
,
going
toward
the
piano
,
and
giving
a
foretaste
of
the
tune
in
his
deep
"
brum
-
brum
,
"
very
pleasant
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
please
,
Philip
,
 
you
play
the
accompaniment
,
"
said
Lucy
,
"
<EOS>
and
then
I
can
go
on
with
my
work
.
<EOS>
You
_
will
_
like
to
play
,
sha'n"t
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
with
a
pretty
,
inquiring
look
,
anxious
,
as
usual
,
lest
she
should
have
proposed
what
was
not
pleasant
to
another
;
but
with
yearnings
toward
her
unfinished
embroidery
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
had
brightened
at
the
proposition
,
for
there
is
no
feeling
,
perhaps
,
except
the
extremes
of
fear
and
grief
,
that
does
not
find
relief
in
music
,
 
that
does
not
make
a
man
sing
or
play
the
better
;
and
Philip
had
an
abundance
of
pent
-
up
feeling
at
this
moment
,
as
complex
as
any
trio
or
quartet
that
was
ever
meant
to
express
love
and
jealousy
and
resignation
and
fierce
suspicion
,
all
at
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
he
said
,
seating
himself
at
the
piano
,
"
it
is
a
way
of
eking
out
one
's
imperfect
life
and
being
three
people
at
once
,
 
to
sing
and
make
the
piano
sing
,
and
hear
them
both
all
the
while
,
 
or
else
to
sing
and
paint
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
there
you
are
an
enviable
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
can
do
nothing
with
my
hands
,
"
said
Stephen
.
<EOS>
"
That
has
generally
been
observed
in
men
of
great
administrative
capacity
,
I
believe
,
 
a
tendency
to
predominance
of
the
reflective
powers
in
me
!
<EOS>
Have
n't
you
observed
that
,
Miss
Tulliver
?
"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
had
fallen
by
mistake
into
his
habit
of
playful
appeal
to
Maggie
,
and
she
could
not
repress
the
answering
flush
and
epigram
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
have
_
observed
a
tendency
to
predominance
,
"
she
said
,
smiling
;
and
Philip
<EOS>
at
that
moment
devoutly
hoped
that
she
found
the
tendency
disagreeable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
"
said
Lucy
;
"
music
,
music
!
<EOS>
We
will
discuss
each
other
's
qualities
another
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
always
tried
in
vain
to
go
on
with
her
work
when
music
began
.
<EOS>
She
tried
harder
than
ever
to
-
day
;
for
the
thought
that
Stephen
knew
how
much
she
cared
for
his
singing
was
one
that
no
longer
roused
a
merely
playful
resistance
;
and
she
knew
,
too
,
that
it
was
his
habit
always
to
stand
so
that
he
could
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
of
no
use
;
she
soon
threw
her
work
down
,
and
all
her
intentions
were
lost
in
the
vague
state
of
emotion
produced
by
the
inspiring
duet
,
 
emotion
that
seemed
to
make
her
at
once
strong
and
weak
;
strong
for
all
enjoyment
,
weak
for
all
resistance
.
<EOS>
When
the
strain
passed
into
the
minor
,
she
half
started
from
her
seat
with
the
sudden
thrill
of
that
change
.
<EOS>
Poor
Maggie
!
<EOS>
She
looked
very
beautiful
when
her
soul
was
being
played
on
in
this
way
by
the
inexorable
power
of
sound
.
<EOS>
You
might
have
seen
the
slightest
perceptible
quivering
through
her
whole
frame
as
she
leaned
a
little
forward
,
clasping
her
hands
as
if
to
steady
herself
;
while
her
eyes
dilated
and
brightened
into
that
wide
-
open
,
childish
expression
of
wondering
delight
which
always
came
back
in
her
happiest
moments
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
who
at
other
times
had
always
been
at
the
piano
when
Maggie
was
looking
in
this
way
,
could
not
resist
the
impulse
to
steal
up
to
her
and
kiss
her
.
<EOS>
Philip
,
too
,
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
now
and
then
round
the
open
book
on
the
desk
,
and
felt
that
he
had
never
before
seen
her
under
so
strong
an
influence
.
  
<EOS>
"
More
,
more
!
"
said
Lucy
,
when
the
duet
had
been
encored
.
<EOS>
"
Something
spirited
again
.
<EOS>
Maggie
always
says
she
likes
a
great
rush
of
sound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
"
Let
us
take
the
road
,
"
then
,
"
said
Stephen
,
 
"
so
suitable
for
a
wet
morning
.
<EOS>
But
are
you
prepared
to
abandon
the
most
sacred
duties
of
life
,
and
come
and
sing
with
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
said
Lucy
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
look
out
the
"
Beggar
's
Opera
'
from
the
large
canterbury
.
<EOS>
It
has
a
dingy
cover
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
great
clue
,
considering
there
are
about
a
score
covers
here
of
rival
dinginess
,
"
said
Stephen
,
drawing
out
the
canterbury
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
play
something
the
while
,
Philip
,
"
said
Lucy
,
noticing
that
his
fingers
were
wandering
over
the
keys
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
you
are
falling
into
?
 
<EOS>
something
delicious
that
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
know
that
?
"
said
Philip
,
bringing
out
the
tune
more
definitely
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
from
the
"
Sonnambula
'
 
"
Ah
!
perchè
non
posso
odiarti
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
the
opera
,
but
it
appears
the
tenor
is
telling
the
heroine
that
he
shall
always
love
her
though
she
may
forsake
him
.
<EOS>
You
've
heard
me
sing
it
to
the
English
words
,
"
I
love
thee
still
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
quite
unintentionally
that
Philip
had
wandered
into
this
song
,
which
might
be
an
indirect
expression
to
Maggie
of
what
he
could
not
prevail
on
himself
to
say
to
her
directly
.
<EOS>
Her
ears
had
been
open
to
what
he
was
saying
,
and
when
he
began
to
sing
,
she
understood
the
plaintive
passion
of
the
music
.
<EOS>
That
pleading
tenor
had
no
very
fine
qualities
as
a
voice
,
but
it
was
not
quite
new
to
her
;
it
had
sung
to
her
by
snatches
,
in
a
subdued
way
,
among
the
grassy
walks
and
hollows
,
and
underneath
the
leaning
ash
-
tree
in
the
Red
Deeps
.
<EOS>
There
seemed
to
be
some
reproach
in
the
words
;
did
Philip
mean
that
?
<EOS>
She
wished
she
had
assured
him
more
distinctly
in
their
conversation
that
she
desired
not
to
renew
the
hope
of
love
between
them
,
_
only
_
because
it
clashed
with
her
inevitable
circumstances
.
<EOS>
She
was
touched
,
not
thrilled
by
the
song
;
it
suggested
distinct
memories
and
thoughts
,
and
brought
quiet
regret
in
the
place
of
excitement
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
way
with
you
tenors
,
"
said
Stephen
,
who
was
waiting
with
music
in
his
hand
while
Philip
finished
the
song
.
<EOS>
"
You
demoralize
the
fair
sex
by
warbling
your
sentimental
love
and
constancy
under
all
sorts
of
vile
treatment
.
<EOS>
Nothing
short
of
having
your
heads
served
up
in
a
dish
like
that
mediæval
tenor
or
troubadour
,
would
prevent
you
from
expressing
your
entire
resignation
.
<EOS>
I
must
administer
an
antidote
,
while
Miss
Deane
prepares
to
tear
herself
away
from
her
bobbins
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
rolled
out
,
with
saucy
energy
,
      
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
,
wasting
in
despair
,
  
Die
because
a
woman
's
fair
?
"
  
and
seemed
to
make
all
the
air
in
the
room
alive
with
a
new
influence
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
always
proud
of
what
Stephen
did
,
went
toward
the
piano
with
laughing
,
admiring
looks
at
him
;
and
Maggie
,
in
spite
of
her
resistance
to
the
spirit
of
the
song
and
to
the
singer
,
was
taken
hold
of
and
shaken
by
the
invisible
influence
,
 
was
borne
along
by
a
wave
too
strong
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
angrily
resolved
not
to
betray
herself
,
she
seized
her
work
,
and
went
on
making
false
stitches
and
pricking
her
fingers
with
much
perseverance
,
not
looking
up
or
taking
notice
of
what
was
going
forward
,
until
all
the
three
voices
united
in
"
Let
us
take
the
road
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
there
would
have
been
a
subtle
,
stealing
gratification
in
her
mind
if
she
had
known
how
entirely
this
saucy
,
defiant
Stephen
was
occupied
with
her
;
how
he
was
passing
rapidly
from
a
determination
to
treat
her
with
ostentatious
indifference
to
an
irritating
desire
for
some
sign
of
inclination
from
her
,
 
some
interchange
of
subdued
word
or
look
with
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
long
before
he
found
an
opportunity
,
when
they
had
passed
to
the
music
of
"
The
Tempest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Maggie
,
feeling
the
need
of
a
footstool
,
was
walking
across
the
room
to
get
one
,
when
Stephen
,
who
was
not
singing
just
then
,
and
was
conscious
of
all
her
movements
,
guessed
her
want
,
and
flew
to
anticipate
her
,
lifting
the
footstool
with
an
entreating
look
at
her
,
which
made
it
impossible
not
to
return
a
glance
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
to
have
the
footstool
placed
carefully
by
a
too
self
-
confident
personage
,
 
not
_
any
_
self
-
confident
personage
,
but
one
in
particular
,
who
suddenly
looks
humble
and
anxious
,
and
lingers
,
bending
still
,
to
ask
if
there
is
not
some
draught
in
that
position
between
the
window
and
the
fireplace
,
and
if
he
may
not
be
allowed
to
move
the
work
-
table
for
her
,
 
these
things
will
summon
a
little
of
the
too
ready
,
traitorous
tenderness
into
a
woman
's
eyes
,
compelled
as
she
is
in
her
girlish
time
to
learn
her
life
-
lessons
in
very
trivial
language
.
<EOS>
And
to
Maggie
such
things
had
not
been
every
-
day
incidents
,
but
were
a
new
element
in
her
life
,
and
found
her
keen
appetite
for
homage
quite
fresh
.
<EOS>
That
tone
of
gentle
solicitude
obliged
her
to
look
at
the
face
that
was
bent
toward
her
,
and
to
say
,
"
No
,
thank
you
"
;
and
nothing
could
prevent
that
mutual
glance
from
being
delicious
to
both
,
as
it
had
been
the
evening
before
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
but
an
ordinary
act
of
politeness
in
Stephen
;
it
had
hardly
taken
two
minutes
;
and
Lucy
,
who
was
singing
,
scarcely
noticed
it
.
<EOS>
But
to
Philip
's
mind
,
filled
already
with
a
vague
anxiety
that
was
likely
to
find
a
definite
ground
for
itself
in
any
trivial
incident
,
this
sudden
eagerness
in
Stephen
,
and
the
change
in
Maggie
's
face
,
which
was
plainly
reflecting
a
beam
from
his
,
seemed
so
strong
a
contrast
with
the
previous
overwrought
signs
of
indifference
,
as
to
be
charged
with
painful
meaning
.
<EOS>
Stephen
's
voice
,
pouring
in
again
,
jarred
upon
his
nervous
susceptibility
as
if
it
had
been
the
clang
of
sheet
-
iron
,
and
he
felt
inclined
to
make
the
piano
shriek
in
utter
discord
.
<EOS>
He
had
really
seen
no
communicable
ground
for
suspecting
any
ususual
feeling
between
Stephen
and
Maggie
;
his
own
reason
told
him
so
,
and
he
wanted
to
go
home
at
once
that
he
might
reflect
coolly
on
these
false
images
,
till
he
had
convinced
himself
of
their
nullity
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
again
,
he
wanted
to
stay
as
long
as
Stephen
stayed
,
 
always
to
be
present
when
Stephen
was
present
with
Maggie
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
poor
Philip
so
natural
,
nay
,
inevitable
,
that
any
man
who
was
near
Maggie
should
fall
in
love
with
her
!
<EOS>
There
was
no
promise
of
happiness
for
her
if
she
were
beguiled
into
loving
Stephen
Guest
;
and
this
thought
emboldened
Philip
to
view
his
own
love
for
her
in
the
light
of
a
less
unequal
offering
.
<EOS>
He
was
beginning
to
play
very
falsely
under
this
deafening
inward
tumult
,
and
Lucy
was
looking
at
him
in
astonishment
,
when
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
entrance
to
summon
them
to
lunch
came
as
an
excuse
for
abruptly
breaking
off

"
Ah
,
Mr.
Philip
!
"
said
Mr.
Deane
,
when
they
entered
the
dining
-
room
,
"
I
've
not
seen
you
for
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
Your
father
's
not
at
home
,
I
think
,
is
he
?
<EOS>
I
went
after
him
to
the
office
the
other
day
,
and
they
said
he
was
out
of
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
been
to
Mudport
on
business
for
several
days
,
"
said
Philip
;
"
but
he
's
come
back
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
fond
of
his
farming
hobby
as
ever
,
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
,
"
said
Philip
,
rather
wondering
at
this
sudden
interest
in
his
father
's
pursuits
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr.
Deane
,
"
he
's
got
some
land
in
his
own
hands
on
this
side
the
river
as
well
as
the
other
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
has
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
!
"
continued
Mr.
Deane
,
as
he
dispensed
the
pigeonpie
,
"
he
must
find
farming
a
heavy
item
,
 
an
expensive
hobby
.
<EOS>
I
never
had
a
hobby
myself
,
never
would
give
in
to
that
.
<EOS>
And
the
worst
of
all
hobbies
are
those
that
people
think
they
can
get
money
at
.
<EOS>
They
shoot
their
money
down
like
corn
out
of
a
sack
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
felt
a
little
nervous
under
her
father
's
apparently
gratuitous
criticism
of
Mr.
Wakem
's
expenditure
.
<EOS>
But
it
ceased
there
,
and
Mr.
Deane
became
unusually
silent
and
meditative
during
his
luncheon
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
accustomed
to
watch
all
indications
in
her
father
,
and
having
reasons
,
which
had
recently
become
strong
,
for
an
extra
interest
in
what
referred
to
the
Wakems
,
felt
an
unusual
curiosity
to
know
what
had
prompted
her
father
's
questions
.
<EOS>
His
subsequent
silence
made
her
suspect
there
had
been
some
special
reason
for
them
in
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
With
this
idea
in
her
head
,
she
resorted
to
her
usual
plan
when
she
wanted
to
tell
or
ask
her
father
anything
particular
:
she
found
a
reason
for
her
aunt
Tulliver
to
leaving
the
dining
-
room
after
dinner
,
and
seated
herself
on
a
small
stool
at
her
father
's
knee
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
,
under
those
circumstances
,
considered
that
he
tasted
some
of
the
most
agreeable
moments
his
merits
had
purchased
him
in
life
,
notwithstanding
that
Lucy
,
disliking
to
have
her
hair
powdered
with
snuff
,
usually
began
by
mastering
his
snuff
-
box
on
such
occasions
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
want
to
go
to
sleep
yet
,
papa
,
_
<EOS>
do
_
you
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
as
she
brought
up
her
stool
and
opened
the
large
fingers
that
clutched
the
snuff
-
box
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
,
"
said
Mr.
Deane
,
glancing
at
the
reward
of
merit
in
the
decanter
.
<EOS>
"
But
what
do
_
<EOS>
you
_
want
?
<EOS>
"
he
added
,
pinching
the
dimpled
chin
fondly
,
 
"
to
coax
some
more
sovereigns
out
of
my
pocket
for
your
bazaar
?
<EOS>
Eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
have
no
base
motives
at
all
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
only
want
to
talk
,
not
to
beg
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
what
made
you
ask
Philip
Wakem
about
his
father
's
farming
to
-
day
,
papa
?
<EOS>
It
seemed
rather
odd
,
because
you
never
hardly
say
anything
to
him
about
his
father
;
and
why
should
you
care
about
Mr.
Wakem
's
losing
money
by
his
hobby
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Something
to
do
with
business
,
"
said
Mr.
Deane
,
waving
his
hands
,
as
if
to
repel
intrusion
into
that
mystery
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
papa
,
you
always
say
Mr.
Wakem
has
brought
Philip
up
like
a
girl
;
how
came
you
to
think
you
should
get
any
business
knowledge
out
of
him
?
<EOS>
Those
abrupt
questions
sounded
rather
oddly
.
<EOS>
Philip
thought
them
queer
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nonsense
,
child
!
"
said
Mr.
Deane
,
willing
to
justify
his
social
demeanor
,
with
which
he
had
taken
some
pains
in
his
upward
progress
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
report
that
Wakem
's
mill
and
farm
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
 
<EOS>
Dorlcote
Mill
,
your
uncle
Tulliver
<EOS>
's
,
you
know
 
is
n't
answering
so
well
as
it
did
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
see
if
your
friend
Philip
would
let
anything
out
about
his
father
's
being
tired
of
farming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
Would
you
buy
the
mill
,
papa
,
if
he
would
part
with
it
?
"
said
Lucy
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
tell
me
everything
;
here
,
you
shall
have
your
snuff
-
box
if
you
'll
tell
me
.
<EOS>
Because
Maggie
says
all
their
hearts
are
set
on
Tom
's
getting
back
the
mill
some
time
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
the
last
things
her
father
said
to
Tom
,
that
he
must
get
back
the
mill
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Hush
,
you
little
puss
,
"
said
Mr.
Deane
,
availing
himself
of
the
restored
snuff
-
box
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
say
a
word
about
this
thing
;
do
you
hear
?
<EOS>
There
's
very
little
chance
of
their
getting
the
mill
or
of
<EOS>
anybody
's
getting
it
out
of
Wakem
's
hands
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
knew
that
we
wanted
it
with
a
view
to
the
Tulliver
's
getting
it
again
,
he
'd
be
the
less
likely
to
part
with
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
natural
,
after
what
happened
.
<EOS>
He
behaved
well
enough
to
Tulliver
before
;
but
a
horsewhipping
is
not
likely
to
be
paid
for
with
sugar
-
plums
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
papa
,
"
said
Lucy
,
with
a
little
air
of
solemnity
,
"
will
you
trust
me
?
<EOS>
You
must
not
ask
me
all
my
reasons
for
what
I
'm
going
to
say
,
but
I
have
very
strong
reasons
.
<EOS>
And
I
'm
very
cautious
;
I
am
,
indeed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
let
us
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
believe
,
if
you
will
let
me
take
Philip
Wakem
into
our
confidence
,
 
let
me
tell
him
all
about
your
wish
to
buy
,
and
what
it
's
for
;
that
my
cousins
wish
to
have
it
,
and
why
they
wish
to
have
it
,
 
<EOS>
I
believe
Philip
would
help
to
bring
it
about
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
would
desire
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
how
that
can
be
,
child
,
"
said
Mr.
Deane
,
looking
puzzled
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
_
he
_
care
?
"
 
<EOS>
then
,
with
a
sudden
penetrating
look
at
his
daughter
,
"
You
do
n't
think
the
poor
lad
's
fond
of
you
,
and
so
you
can
make
him
do
what
you
like
?
"
<EOS>
(
Mr.
Deane
felt
quite
safe
about
his
daughter
's
affections
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
papa
;
he
cares
very
little
about
me
,
 
not
so
much
as
I
care
about
him
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
a
reason
for
being
quite
sure
of
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
ask
me
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
ever
guess
,
do
n't
tell
me
.
<EOS>
Only
give
me
leave
to
do
as
I
think
fit
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
rose
from
her
stool
to
seat
herself
on
her
father
's
knee
,
and
kissed
him
with
that
last
request
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
you
wo
n't
do
mischief
,
now
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
looking
at
her
with
delight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
papa
,
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
I
'm
very
wise
;
I
've
got
all
your
business
talents
.
<EOS>
Did
n't
you
admire
my
accompt
-
book
,
now
,
when
I
showed
it
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
if
this
youngster
will
keep
his
counsel
,
there
wo
n't
be
much
harm
done
.
<EOS>
And
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
think
there
's
not
much
chance
for
us
any
other
way
.
<EOS>
Now
,
let
me
go
off
to
sleep

"
    
<EOS>
Wakem
in
a
New
Light
  
<EOS>
Before
three
days
had
passed
after
the
conversation
you
have
just
overheard
between
Lucy
and
her
father
she
had
contrived
to
have
a
private
interview
with
Philip
during
a
visit
of
Maggie
's
to
her
aunt
Glegg
.
<EOS>
For
a
day
and
a
night
Philip
turned
over
in
his
mind
with
restless
agitation
all
that
Lucy
had
told
him
in
that
interview
,
till
he
had
thoroughly
resolved
on
a
course
of
action
.
<EOS>
He
thought
he
saw
before
him
now
a
possibility
of
altering
his
position
with
respect
to
Maggie
,
and
removing
at
least
one
obstacle
between
them
.
<EOS>
He
laid
his
plan
and
calculated
all
his
moves
with
the
fervid
deliberation
of
a
chess
-
player
in
the
days
of
his
first
ardor
,
and
was
amazed
himself
at
his
sudden
genius
as
a
tactician
.
<EOS>
His
plan
was
as
bold
as
it
was
thoroughly
calculated
.
<EOS>
Having
watched
for
a
moment
when
his
father
had
nothing
more
urgent
on
his
hands
than
the
newspaper
,
he
went
behind
him
,
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
,
and
said
,
    
"
Father
,
will
you
come
up
into
my
sanctum
,
and
look
at
my
new
sketches
?
<EOS>
I
've
arranged
them
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
getting
terrible
stiff
in
the
joints
,
Phil
,
for
climbing
those
stairs
of
yours
,
"
said
Wakem
,
looking
kindly
at
his
son
as
he
laid
down
his
paper
.
<EOS>
"
But
come
along
,
then
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
nice
place
for
you
,
is
n't
it
,
Phil
?
 
<EOS>
a
capital
light
that
from
the
roof
,
eh
?
"
was
,
as
usual
,
the
first
thing
he
said
on
entering
the
painting
-
room
.
<EOS>
He
liked
to
remind
himself
and
his
son
too
that
his
fatherly
indulgence
had
provided
the
accommodation
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
good
father
.
<EOS>
Emily
would
have
nothing
to
reproach
him
with
there
,
if
she
came
back
again
from
her
grave
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
"
he
said
,
putting
his
double
eye
-
glass
over
his
nose
,
and
seating
himself
to
take
a
general
view
while
he
rested
,
"
you
've
got
a
famous
show
here
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
I
do
n't
see
that
your
things
are
n't
as
good
as
that
London
artist
's
 
<EOS>
what
's
his
name
 
that
Leyburn
gave
so
much
money
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
shook
his
head
and
smiled
.
<EOS>
He
had
seated
himself
on
his
painting
-
stool
,
and
had
taken
a
lead
pencil
in
his
hand
,
with
which
he
was
making
strong
marks
to
counteract
the
sense
of
tremulousness
.
<EOS>
He
watched
his
father
get
up
,
and
walk
slowly
round
,
good
-
naturedly
dwelling
on
the
pictures
much
longer
than
his
amount
of
genuine
taste
for
landscape
would
have
prompted
,
till
he
stopped
before
a
stand
on
which
two
pictures
were
placed
,
 
one
much
larger
than
the
other
,
the
smaller
one
in
a
leather
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
me
!
<EOS>
what
have
you
here
?
"
said
Wakem
,
startled
by
a
sudden
transition
from
landscape
to
portrait
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
'd
left
off
figures
.
<EOS>
Who
are
these
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
the
same
person
,
"
said
Philip
,
with
calm
promptness
,
"
at
different
ages
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
person
?
"
said
Wakem
,
sharply
fixing
his
eyes
with
a
growing
look
of
suspicion
on
the
larger
picture
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
The
small
one
is
something
like
what
she
was
when
I
was
at
school
with
her
brother
at
King
's
Lorton
;
the
larger
one
is
not
quite
so
good
a
likeness
of
what
she
was
when
I
came
from
abroad
.
"
  
<EOS>
Wakem
turned
round
fiercely
,
with
a
flushed
face
,
letting
his
eye
-
glass
fall
,
and
looking
at
his
son
with
a
savage
expression
for
a
moment
,
as
if
he
was
ready
to
strike
that
daring
feebleness
from
the
stool
.
<EOS>
But
he
threw
himself
into
the
armchair
again
,
and
thrust
his
hands
into
his
trouser
-
pockets
,
still
looking
angrily
at
his
son
,
however
.
<EOS>
Philip
did
not
return
the
look
,
but
sat
quietly
watching
the
point
of
his
pencil
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
mean
to
say
,
then
,
that
you
have
had
any
acquaintance
with
her
since
you
came
from
abroad
?
"
said
Wakem
,
at
last
,
with
that
vain
effort
which
rage
always
makes
to
throw
as
much
punishment
as
it
desires
to
inflict
into
words
and
tones
,
since
blows
are
forbidden
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
saw
a
great
deal
of
her
for
a
whole
year
before
her
father
's
death
.
<EOS>
We
met
often
in
that
thicket
 
<EOS>
the
Red
Deeps
 
near
Dorlcote
Mill
.
<EOS>
I
love
her
dearly
;
I
shall
never
love
any
other
woman
.
<EOS>
I
have
thought
of
her
ever
since
she
was
a
little
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Go
on
,
sir
!
<EOS>
And
you
have
corresponded
with
her
all
this
while
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
I
never
told
her
I
loved
her
till
just
before
we
parted
,
and
she
promised
her
brother
not
to
see
me
again
or
to
correspond
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
that
she
loves
me
or
would
consent
to
marry
me
.
<EOS>
But
if
she
would
consent
,
 
if
she
_
did
_
love
me
well
enough
,
 
I
should
marry
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
this
is
the
return
you
make
me
for
all
the
indulgences
I
've
heaped
on
you
?
"
<EOS>
said
Wakem
,
getting
white
,
and
beginning
to
tremble
under
an
enraged
sense
of
impotence
before
Philip
's
calm
defiance
and
concentration
of
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
father
,
"
said
Philip
,
looking
up
at
him
for
the
first
time
;
"
I
do
n't
regard
it
as
a
return
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
an
indulgent
father
to
me
;
but
I
have
always
felt
that
it
was
because
you
had
an
affectionate
wish
to
give
me
as
much
happiness
as
my
unfortunate
lot
would
admit
,
not
that
it
was
a
debt
you
expected
me
to
pay
by
sacrificing
all
my
chances
of
happiness
to
satisfy
feelings
of
yours
which
I
can
never
share
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
most
sons
would
share
their
father
's
feelings
in
this
case
,
"
said
Wakem
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
The
girl
's
father
was
an
ignorant
mad
brute
,
who
was
within
an
inch
of
murdering
me
.
<EOS>
The
whole
town
knows
it
.
<EOS>
And
the
brother
is
just
as
insolent
,
only
in
a
cooler
way
.
<EOS>
He
forbade
her
seeing
you
,
you
say
;
he
'll
break
every
bone
in
your
body
,
for
your
greater
happiness
,
if
you
do
n't
take
care
.
<EOS>
But
you
seem
to
have
made
up
your
mind
;
you
have
counted
the
consequences
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
are
independent
of
me
;
you
can
marry
this
girl
to
-
morrow
,
if
you
like
;
you
are
a
man
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
 
you
can
go
your
way
,
and
I
can
go
mine
.
<EOS>
We
need
have
no
more
to
do
with
each
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
Wakem
rose
and
walked
toward
the
door
,
but
something
held
him
back
,
and
instead
of
leaving
the
room
,
he
walked
up
and
down
it
.
<EOS>
Philip
was
slow
to
reply
,
and
when
he
spoke
,
his
tone
had
a
more
incisive
quietness
and
clearness
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
ca
n't
marry
Miss
Tulliver
,
even
if
she
would
have
me
,
if
I
have
only
my
own
resources
to
maintain
her
with
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
brought
up
to
no
profession
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
offer
her
poverty
as
well
as
deformity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
_
there
_
is
a
reason
for
your
clinging
to
me
,
doubtless
,
"
said
Wakem
,
still
bitterly
,
though
Philip
's
last
words
had
given
him
a
pang
;
they
had
stirred
a
feeling
which
had
been
a
habit
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
.
<EOS>
He
threw
himself
into
the
chair
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
expected
all
this
,
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
these
scenes
are
often
happening
between
father
and
son
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
like
other
men
of
my
age
,
I
might
answer
your
angry
words
by
still
angrier
;
we
might
part
;
I
should
marry
the
woman
I
love
,
and
have
a
chance
of
being
as
happy
as
the
rest
.
<EOS>
But
if
it
will
be
a
satisfaction
to
you
to
annihilate
the
very
object
of
everything
you
've
done
for
me
,
you
have
an
advantage
over
most
fathers
;
you
can
completely
deprive
me
of
the
only
thing
that
would
make
my
life
worth
having
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
paused
,
but
his
father
was
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
best
what
satisfaction
you
would
have
,
beyond
that
of
gratifying
a
ridiculous
rancor
worthy
only
of
wandering
savages
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ridiculous
rancor
!
"
<EOS>
Wakem
burst
out
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
Damn
it
!
<EOS>
is
a
man
to
be
horsewhipped
by
a
boor
and
love
him
for
it
?
<EOS>
Besides
,
there
's
that
cold
,
proud
devil
of
a
son
,
who
said
a
word
to
me
<EOS>
I
shall
not
forget
when
we
had
the
settling
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
as
pleasant
a
mark
for
a
bullet
as
I
know
,
if
he
were
worth
the
expense
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
your
resentment
toward
them
,
"
said
Philip
,
who
had
his
reasons
for
some
sympathy
with
this
view
of
Tom
,
"
though
a
feeling
of
revenge
is
not
worth
much
,
that
you
should
care
to
keep
it
.
<EOS>
I
mean
your
extending
the
enmity
to
a
helpless
girl
,
who
has
too
much
sense
and
goodness
to
share
their
narrow
prejudices
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
has
never
entered
into
the
family
quarrels
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
that
signify
?
<EOS>
We
do
n't
ask
what
a
woman
does
;
we
ask
whom
she
belongs
to
.
<EOS>
It
's
altogether
a
degrading
thing
to
you
,
to
think
of
marrying
old
Tulliver
's
daughter
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
in
the
dialogue
,
Philip
lost
some
of
his
self
-
control
,
and
colored
with
anger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Tulliver
,
"
he
said
,
with
bitter
incisiveness
,
"
has
the
only
grounds
of
rank
that
anything
but
vulgar
folly
can
suppose
to
belong
to
the
middle
class
;
she
is
thoroughly
refined
,
and
her
friends
,
whatever
else
they
may
be
,
are
respected
for
irreproachable
honor
and
integrity
.
<EOS>
All
St.
Ogg
's
,
I
fancy
,
would
pronounce
her
to
be
more
than
my
equal
.
"
  
<EOS>
Wakem
darted
a
glance
of
fierce
question
at
his
son
;
but
Philip
was
not
looking
at
him
,
and
with
a
certain
penitent
consciousness
went
on
,
in
a
few
moments
,
as
if
in
amplification
of
his
last
words
,
    
"
Find
a
single
person
in
St.
Ogg
's
who
will
not
tell
you
that
a
beautiful
creature
like
her
would
be
throwing
herself
away
on
a
pitiable
object
like
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
she
!
"
said
Wakem
,
rising
again
,
and
forgetting
everything
else
in
a
burst
of
resentful
pride
,
half
fatherly
,
half
personal
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
deuced
fine
match
for
her
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
stuff
about
an
accidental
deformity
,
when
a
girl
's
really
attached
to
a
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
girls
are
not
apt
to
get
attached
under
those
circumstances
,
"
said
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
said
Wakem
,
rather
brutally
,
trying
to
recover
his
previous
position
,
"
if
she
does
n't
care
for
you
,
you
might
have
spared
yourself
the
trouble
of
talking
to
me
about
her
,
and
you
might
have
spared
me
the
trouble
of
refusing
my
consent
to
what
was
never
likely
to
happen
.
"
  
<EOS>
Wakem
strode
to
the
door
,
and
without
looking
round
again
,
banged
it
after
him
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
was
not
without
confidence
that
his
father
would
be
ultimately
wrought
upon
as
he
had
expected
,
by
what
had
passed
;
but
the
scene
had
jarred
upon
his
nerves
,
which
were
as
sensitive
as
a
woman
's
.
<EOS>
He
determined
not
to
go
down
to
dinner
;
he
could
n't
meet
his
father
again
that
day
.
<EOS>
It
was
Wakem
's
habit
,
when
he
had
no
company
at
home
,
to
go
out
in
the
evening
,
often
as
early
as
half
-
past
seven
;
and
as
it
was
far
on
in
the
afternoon
now
,
Philip
locked
up
his
room
and
went
out
for
a
long
ramble
,
thinking
he
would
not
return
until
his
father
was
out
of
the
house
again
.
<EOS>
He
got
into
a
boat
,
and
went
down
the
river
to
a
favorite
village
,
where
he
dined
,
and
lingered
till
it
was
late
enough
for
him
to
return
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
had
any
sort
of
quarrel
with
his
father
before
,
and
had
a
sickening
fear
that
this
contest
,
just
begun
,
might
go
on
for
weeks
;
and
what
might
not
happen
in
that
time
?
<EOS>
He
would
not
allow
himself
to
define
what
that
involuntary
question
meant
.
<EOS>
But
if
he
could
once
be
in
the
position
of
Maggie
's
accepted
,
acknowledged
lover
,
there
would
be
less
room
for
vague
dread
.
<EOS>
He
went
up
to
his
painting
-
room
again
,
and
threw
himself
with
a
sense
of
fatigue
into
the
armchair
,
looking
round
absently
at
the
views
of
water
and
rock
that
were
ranged
around
,
till
he
fell
into
a
doze
,
in
which
he
fancied
Maggie
was
slipping
down
a
glistening
,
green
,
slimy
channel
of
a
waterfall
,
and
he
was
looking
on
helpless
,
till
he
was
awakened
by
what
seemed
a
sudden
,
awful
crash
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
opening
of
the
door
,
and
he
could
hardly
have
dozed
more
than
a
few
moments
,
for
there
was
no
perceptible
change
in
the
evening
light
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
father
who
entered
;
and
when
Philip
moved
to
vacate
the
chair
for
him
,
he
said
,
    
"
Sit
still
.
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
walk
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
stalked
up
and
down
the
room
once
or
twice
,
and
then
,
standing
opposite
Philip
with
his
hands
thrust
in
his
side
pockets
,
he
said
,
as
if
continuing
a
conversation
that
had
not
been
broken
off
,
    
<EOS>
"
But
this
girl
seems
to
have
been
fond
of
you
,
Phil
,
else
she
would
n't
have
met
you
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
heart
was
beating
rapidly
,
and
a
transient
flush
passed
over
his
face
like
a
gleam
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
quite
easy
to
speak
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
liked
me
at
King
's
Lorton
,
when
she
was
a
little
girl
,
because
I
used
to
sit
with
her
brother
a
great
deal
when
he
had
hurt
his
foot
.
<EOS>
She
had
kept
that
in
her
memory
,
and
thought
of
me
as
a
friend
of
a
long
while
ago
.
<EOS>
She
did
n't
think
of
me
as
a
lover
when
she
met
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
you
made
love
to
her
at
last
.
<EOS>
What
did
she
say
then
?
<EOS>
"
said
Wakem
,
walking
about
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
said
she
_
<EOS>
did
_
love
me
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Confound
it
,
then
;
what
else
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
Is
she
a
jilt
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
very
young
then
,
"
said
Philip
,
hesitatingly
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
she
hardly
knew
what
she
felt
.
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
our
long
separation
,
and
the
idea
that
events
must
always
divide
us
,
may
have
made
a
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
she
's
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
I
've
seen
her
at
church
.
<EOS>
Have
n't
you
spoken
to
her
since
you
came
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
at
Mr.
Deane
's
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
n't
renew
my
proposals
to
her
on
several
grounds
.
<EOS>
One
obstacle
would
be
removed
if
you
would
give
your
consent
,
 
if
you
would
be
willing
to
think
of
her
as
a
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
"
  
<EOS>
Wakem
was
silent
a
little
while
,
pausing
before
Maggie
's
picture
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
not
the
sort
of
woman
<EOS>
your
mother
was
,
though
,
Phil
,
"
he
said
,
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
I
saw
her
at
church
,
 
she
's
handsomer
than
this
,
 
deuced
fine
eyes
and
fine
figure
,
I
saw
;
but
rather
dangerous
and
unmanageable
,
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
very
tender
and
affectionate
,
and
so
simple
,
 
without
the
airs
and
petty
contrivances
other
women
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
?
"
said
Wakem
.
<EOS>
Then
looking
round
at
his
son
,
"
<EOS>
But
your
mother
looked
gentler
;
she
had
that
brown
wavy
hair
and
gray
eyes
,
like
yours
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
remember
her
very
well
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
thousand
pities
<EOS>
I
'd
no
likeness
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
should
n't
you
be
glad
for
me
to
have
the
same
sort
of
happiness
,
father
,
to
sweeten
my
life
for
me
?
<EOS>
There
can
never
be
another
tie
so
strong
to
you
as
that
which
began
eight
-
and
-
twenty
years
ago
,
when
you
married
my
mother
,
and
you
have
been
tightening
it
ever
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
,
Phil
,
you
're
the
only
fellow
that
knows
the
best
of
me
,
"
said
Wakem
,
giving
his
hand
to
his
son
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
keep
together
if
we
can
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
what
am
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
You
must
come
downstairs
and
tell
me
.
<EOS>
Am
I
to
go
and
call
on
this
dark
-
eyed
damsel
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
barrier
once
thrown
down
in
this
way
,
Philip
could
talk
freely
to
his
father
of
their
entire
relation
with
the
Tullivers
,
 
of
the
desire
to
get
the
mill
and
land
back
into
the
family
,
and
of
its
transfer
to
Guest
&
Co.
as
an
intermediate
step
.
<EOS>
He
could
venture
now
to
be
persuasive
and
urgent
,
and
his
father
yielded
with
more
readiness
than
he
had
calculated
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
I
_
do
n't
care
about
the
mill
,
"
he
said
at
last
,
with
a
sort
of
angry
compliance
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
had
an
infernal
deal
of
bother
lately
about
the
mill
.
<EOS>
Let
them
pay
me
for
my
improvements
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
one
thing
you
need
n't
ask
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
no
direct
transactions
with
young
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
If
you
like
to
swallow
him
for
his
sister
's
sake
,
you
may
;
but
I
've
no
sauce
that
will
make
him
go
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
leave
you
to
imagine
the
agreeable
feelings
with
which
Philip
went
to
Mr.
Deane
the
next
day
,
to
say
that
Mr.
Wakem
was
ready
to
open
the
negotiations
,
and
Lucy
's
pretty
triumph
as
she
appealed
to
her
father
whether
she
had
not
proved
her
great
business
abilities
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
was
rather
puzzled
,
and
suspected
that
there
had
been
something
"
going
on
"
among
the
young
people
to
which
he
wanted
a
clew
.
<EOS>
But
to
men
of
Mr.
Deane
's
stamp
,
what
goes
on
among
the
young
people
is
as
extraneous
to
the
real
business
of
life
as
what
goes
on
among
the
birds
and
butterflies
,
until
it
can
be
shown
to
have
a
malign
bearing
on
monetary
affairs
.
<EOS>
And
in
this
case
the
bearing
appeared
to
be
entirely
propitious
.

The
culmination
of
Maggie
's
career
as
an
admired
member
of
society
in
St.
Ogg
's
was
certainly
the
day
of
the
bazaar
,
when
her
simple
noble
beauty
,
clad
in
a
white
muslin
of
some
soft
-
floating
kind
,
which
I
suspect
must
have
come
from
the
stores
of
aunt
Pullet
's
wardrobe
,
appeared
with
marked
distinction
among
the
more
adorned
and
conventional
women
around
her
.
<EOS>
We
perhaps
never
detect
how
much
of
our
social
demeanor
is
made
up
of
artificial
airs
until
we
see
a
person
who
is
at
once
beautiful
and
simple
;
without
the
beauty
,
we
are
apt
to
call
simplicity
awkwardness
.
<EOS>
The
Miss
Guests
were
much
too
well
-
bred
to
have
any
of
the
grimaces
and
affected
tones
that
belong
to
pretentious
vulgarity
;
but
their
stall
being
next
to
the
one
where
Maggie
sat
,
it
seemed
newly
obvious
to
-
day
that
Miss
Guest
held
her
chin
too
high
,
and
that
Miss
Laura
spoke
and
moved
continually
with
a
view
to
effect
.
  
<EOS>
All
well
-
dressed
St.
Ogg
's
and
its
neighborhood
were
there
;
and
it
would
have
been
worth
while
to
come
even
from
a
distance
,
to
see
the
fine
old
hall
,
with
its
open
roof
and
carved
oaken
rafters
,
and
great
oaken
folding
-
doors
,
and
light
shed
down
from
a
height
on
the
many
-
colored
show
beneath
;
a
very
quaint
place
,
with
broad
faded
stripes
painted
on
the
walls
,
and
here
and
there
a
show
of
heraldic
animals
of
a
bristly
,
long
-
snouted
character
,
the
cherished
emblems
of
a
noble
family
once
the
seigniors
of
this
now
civic
hall
.
<EOS>
A
grand
arch
,
cut
in
the
upper
wall
at
one
end
,
surmounted
an
oaken
orchestra
,
with
an
open
room
behind
it
,
where
hothouse
plants
and
stalls
for
refreshments
were
disposed
;
an
agreeable
resort
for
gentlemen
disposed
to
loiter
,
and
yet
to
exchange
the
occasional
crush
down
below
for
a
more
commodious
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
perfect
fitness
of
this
ancient
building
for
an
admirable
modern
purpose
,
that
made
charity
truly
elegant
,
and
led
through
vanity
up
to
the
supply
of
a
deficit
,
was
so
striking
that
hardly
a
person
entered
the
room
without
exchanging
the
remark
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
Near
the
great
arch
over
the
orchestra
was
the
stone
oriel
with
painted
glass
,
which
was
one
of
the
venerable
inconsistencies
of
the
old
hall
;
and
it
was
close
by
this
that
Lucy
had
her
stall
,
for
the
convenience
of
certain
large
plain
articles
which
she
had
taken
charge
of
for
Mrs.
Kenn
.
<EOS>
Maggie
had
begged
to
sit
at
the
open
end
of
the
stall
,
and
to
have
the
sale
of
these
articles
rather
than
of
bead
-
mats
and
other
elaborate
products
of
which
she
had
but
a
dim
understanding
.
<EOS>
But
it
soon
appeared
that
the
gentlemen
's
dressing
-
gowns
,
which
were
among
her
commodities
,
were
objects
of
such
general
attention
and
inquiry
,
and
excited
<EOS>
so
troublesome
a
curiosity
as
to
their
lining
and
comparative
merits
,
together
with
a
determination
to
test
them
by
trying
on
,
as
to
make
her
post
a
very
conspicuous
one
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
who
had
commodities
of
their
own
to
sell
,
and
did
not
want
dressing
-
gowns
,
saw
at
once
the
frivolity
and
bad
taste
of
this
masculine
preference
for
goods
which
any
tailor
could
furnish
;
and
it
is
possible
that
the
emphatic
notice
of
various
kinds
which
was
drawn
toward
Miss
Tulliver
on
this
public
occasion
,
threw
a
very
strong
and
unmistakable
light
on
her
subsequent
conduct
in
many
minds
then
present
.
<EOS>
Not
that
anger
,
on
account
of
spurned
beauty
can
dwell
in
the
celestial
breasts
of
charitable
ladies
,
but
rather
that
the
errors
of
persons
who
have
once
been
much
admired
necessarily
take
a
deeper
tinge
from
the
mere
force
of
contrast
;
and
also
,
that
to
-
day
Maggie
's
conspicuous
position
,
for
the
first
time
,
made
evident
certain
characteristics
which
were
subsequently
felt
to
have
an
explanatory
bearing
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
rather
bold
in
Miss
Tulliver
's
direct
gaze
,
and
something
undefinably
coarse
in
the
style
of
her
beauty
,
which
placed
her
,
in
the
opinion
of
all
feminine
judges
,
far
below
her
cousin
Miss
Deane
;
for
the
ladies
of
St.
Ogg
's
had
now
completely
ceded
to
Lucy
their
hypothetic
claims
on
the
admiration
of
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
dear
little
Lucy
herself
,
her
late
benevolent
triumph
about
the
Mill
,
and
all
the
affectionate
projects
she
was
cherishing
for
Maggie
and
Philip
,
helped
to
give
her
the
highest
spirits
to
-
day
,
and
she
felt
nothing
but
pleasure
in
the
evidence
of
Maggie
's
attractiveness
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
,
she
was
looking
very
charming
herself
,
and
Stephen
was
paying
her
the
utmost
attention
on
this
public
occasion
;
jealously
buying
up
the
articles
he
had
seen
under
her
fingers
in
the
process
of
making
,
and
gayly
helping
her
to
cajole
the
male
customers
into
the
purchase
of
the
most
effeminate
futilities
.
<EOS>
He
chose
to
lay
aside
his
hat
and
wear
a
scarlet
fez
of
her
embroidering
;
but
by
superficial
observers
this
was
necessarily
liable
to
be
interpreted
less
as
a
compliment
to
Lucy
than
as
a
mark
of
coxcombry
.
<EOS>
"
Guest
is
a
great
coxcomb
,
"
young
Torry
observed
;
"
but
then
he
is
a
privileged
person
in
St.
Ogg
's
 
<EOS>
he
carries
all
before
him
;
if
another
fellow
did
such
things
,
everybody
would
say
he
made
a
fool
of
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
Stephen
purchased
absolutely
nothing
from
Maggie
,
until
Lucy
said
,
in
rather
a
vexed
undertone
<EOS>
,
    
"
See
,
now
;
all
the
things
of
Maggie
's
knitting
will
be
gone
,
and
you
will
not
have
bought
one
.
<EOS>
There
are
those
deliciously
soft
warm
things
for
the
wrists
,
 
do
buy
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
"
said
Stephen
,
"
they
must
be
intended
for
imaginative
persons
,
who
can
chill
themselves
on
this
warm
day
by
thinking
of
the
frosty
Caucasus
.
<EOS>
Stern
reason
is
my
forte
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
You
must
get
Philip
to
buy
those
.
<EOS>
By
the
way
,
why
does
n't
he
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
never
likes
going
where
there
are
many
people
,
though
I
enjoined
him
to
come
.
<EOS>
He
said
he
would
buy
up
any
of
my
goods
that
the
rest
of
the
world
rejected
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
do
go
and
buy
something
of
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
see
,
she
has
got
a
customer
;
there
is
old
Wakem
himself
just
coming
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
's
eyes
turned
with
anxious
interest
toward
Maggie
to
see
how
she
went
through
this
first
interview
,
since
a
sadly
memorable
time
,
with
a
man
toward
whom
she
must
have
so
strange
a
mixture
of
feelings
;
but
she
was
pleased
to
notice
that
Wakem
had
tact
enough
to
enter
at
once
into
talk
about
the
bazaar
wares
,
and
appear
interested
in
purchasing
,
smiling
now
and
then
kindly
at
Maggie
,
and
not
calling
on
her
to
speak
much
,
as
if
he
observed
that
she
was
rather
pale
and
tremulous
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Wakem
is
making
himself
particularly
amiable
to
your
cousin
,
"
said
Stephen
,
in
an
undertone
to
Lucy
;
"
is
it
pure
magnanimity
?
<EOS>
You
talked
of
a
family
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
will
soon
be
quite
healed
,
I
hope
,
"
said
Lucy
,
becoming
a
little
indiscreet
in
her
satisfaction
,
and
speaking
with
an
air
of
significance
.
<EOS>
But
Stephen
did
not
appear
to
notice
this
,
and
as
some
lady
-
purchasers
came
up
,
he
lounged
on
toward
Maggie
's
end
,
handling
trifles
and
standing
aloof
until
Wakem
,
who
had
taken
out
his
purse
,
had
finished
his
transactions
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
son
came
with
me
,
"
he
overheard
Wakem
saying
,
"
but
he
has
vanished
into
some
other
part
of
the
building
,
and
has
left
all
these
charitable
gallantries
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
'll
reproach
him
for
his
shabby
conduct
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
returned
his
smile
and
bow
without
speaking
,
and
he
turned
away
,
only
then
observing
Stephen
and
nodding
to
him
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
conscious
that
Stephen
was
still
there
,
busied
herself
with
counting
money
,
and
avoided
looking
up
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
well
pleased
that
he
had
devoted
himself
to
Lucy
to
-
day
,
and
had
not
come
near
her
.
<EOS>
They
had
begun
the
morning
with
an
indifferent
salutation
,
and
both
had
rejoiced
in
being
aloof
from
each
other
,
like
a
patient
who
has
actually
done
without
his
opium
,
in
spite
of
former
failures
in
resolution
.
<EOS>
And
during
the
last
few
days
they
had
even
been
making
up
their
minds
to
failures
,
looking
to
the
outward
events
that
must
soon
come
to
separate
them
,
as
a
reason
for
dispensing
with
self
-
conquest
in
detail
.
  
<EOS>
Stephen
moved
step
by
step
as
if
he
were
being
unwillingly
dragged
,
until
he
had
got
round
the
open
end
of
the
stall
,
and
was
half
hidden
by
a
screen
of
draperies
.
<EOS>
Maggie
went
on
counting
her
money
till
she
suddenly
heard
a
deep
gentle
voice
saying
,
"
Are
n't
you
very
tried
?
<EOS>
Do
let
me
bring
you
something
,
 
some
fruit
or
jelly
,
may
n't
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
unexpected
tones
shook
her
like
a
sudden
accidental
vibration
of
a
harp
close
by
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
thank
you
,
"
she
said
faintly
,
and
only
half
looking
up
for
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
look
so
pale
,
"
Stephen
insisted
,
in
a
more
entreating
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
you
're
exhausted
.
<EOS>
I
must
disobey
you
,
and
bring
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
I
could
n't
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
angry
with
me
?
<EOS>
What
have
I
done
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Do
_
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Pray
,
go
away
,
"
said
Maggie
,
looking
at
him
helplessly
,
her
eyes
glancing
immediately
from
him
to
the
opposite
corner
of
the
orchestra
,
which
was
half
hidden
by
the
folds
of
the
old
faded
green
curtain
.
<EOS>
Maggie
had
no
sooner
uttered
this
entreaty
than
she
was
wretched
at
the
admission
it
implied
;
but
Stephen
turned
away
at
once
,
and
following
her
upward
glance
,
he
saw
Philip
Wakem
sealed
in
the
half
-
hidden
corner
,
so
that
he
could
command
little
more
than
that
angle
of
the
hall
in
which
Maggie
sat
.
<EOS>
An
entirely
new
though
occurred
to
Stephen
,
and
linking
itself
with
what
he
had
observed
of
Wakem
's
manner
,
and
with
Lucy
's
reply
to
his
observation
,
it
convinced
him
that
there
had
been
some
former
relation
between
Philip
and
Maggie
beyond
that
childish
one
of
which
he
had
heard
.
<EOS>
More
than
one
impulse
made
him
immediately
leave
the
hall
and
go
upstairs
to
the
refreshment
-
room
,
where
,
walking
up
to
Philip
,
he
sat
down
behind
him
,
and
put
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
studying
for
a
portrait
,
Phil
,
"
he
said
,
"
or
for
a
sketch
of
that
oriel
window
?
<EOS>
By
George
,
it
makes
a
capital
bit
from
this
dark
corner
,
with
the
curtain
just
marking
it
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
studying
expression
,
"
said
Philip
,
curtly
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
Miss
Tulliver
's
?
<EOS>
It
's
rather
of
the
savage
-
moody
order
<EOS>
to
-
day
,
I
think
,
 
something
of
the
fallen
princess
serving
behind
a
counter
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
sent
me
to
her
with
a
civil
offer
to
get
her
some
refreshment
,
but
I
have
been
snubbed
,
as
usual
.
<EOS>
There
's
natural
antipathy
between
us
,
I
suppose
;
I
have
seldom
the
honor
to
please
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
hypocrite
you
are
!
"
said
Philip
,
flushing
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
because
experience
must
have
told
me
that
I
'm
universally
pleasing
?
<EOS>
I
admit
the
law
,
but
there
's
some
disturbing
force
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
,
"
said
Philip
,
rising
abruptly
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
am
I
 
to
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
;
this
place
gets
oppressive
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
done
suit
and
service
long
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
two
friends
walked
downstairs
together
without
speaking
.
<EOS>
Philip
turned
through
the
outer
door
into
the
court
-
yard
;
but
Stephen
,
saying
,
"
Oh
,
by
the
by
,
I
must
call
in
here
,
"
went
on
along
the
passage
to
one
of
the
rooms
at
the
other
end
of
the
building
,
which
were
appropriated
to
the
town
library
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
room
all
to
himself
,
and
a
man
requires
nothing
less
than
this
when
he
wants
to
dash
his
cap
on
the
table
,
throw
himself
astride
a
chair
,
and
stare
at
a
high
brick
wall
with
a
frown
which
would
not
have
been
beneath
the
occasion
if
he
had
been
slaying
"
the
giant
Python
.
<EOS>
"
The
conduct
that
issues
from
a
moral
conflict
has
often
so
close
a
resemblance
to
vice
that
the
distinction
escapes
all
outward
judgments
founded
on
a
mere
comparison
of
actions
.
<EOS>
It
is
clear
to
you
,
I
hope
,
that
Stephen
was
not
a
hypocrite
,
 
capable
of
deliberate
doubleness
for
a
selfish
end
;
and
yet
his
fluctuations
between
the
indulgence
of
a
feeling
and
the
systematic
concealment
of
it
might
have
made
a
good
case
in
support
of
Philip
's
accusation
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Maggie
sat
at
her
stall
cold
and
trembling
,
with
that
painful
sensation
in
the
eyes
which
comes
from
resolutely
repressed
tears
.
<EOS>
Was
her
life
to
be
always
like
this
,
 
always
bringing
some
new
source
of
inward
strife
?
<EOS>
She
heard
confusedly
the
busy
,
indifferent
voices
around
her
,
and
wished
her
mind
could
flow
into
that
easy
babbling
current
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
this
moment
that
Dr.
Kenn
,
who
had
quite
lately
come
into
the
hall
,
and
was
now
walking
down
the
middle
with
his
hands
behind
him
,
taking
a
general
view
,
fixed
his
eyes
on
Maggie
for
the
first
time
,
and
was
struck
with
the
expression
of
pain
on
her
beautiful
face
.
<EOS>
She
was
sitting
quite
still
,
for
the
stream
of
customers
had
lessened
at
this
late
hour
in
the
afternoon
;
the
gentlemen
had
chiefly
chosen
the
middle
of
the
day
,
and
Maggie
's
stall
was
looking
rather
bare
.
<EOS>
This
,
with
her
absent
,
pained
expression
,
finished
the
contrast
between
her
and
her
companions
,
who
were
all
bright
,
eager
,
and
busy
.
<EOS>
He
was
strongly
arrested
.
<EOS>
Her
face
had
naturally
drawn
his
attention
as
a
new
and
striking
one
at
church
,
and
he
had
been
introduced
to
her
during
a
short
call
on
business
at
Mr.
Deane
's
,
but
he
had
never
spoken
more
than
three
words
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
walked
toward
her
now
,
and
Maggie
,
perceiving
some
one
approaching
,
roused
herself
to
look
up
and
be
prepared
to
speak
.
<EOS>
She
felt
a
childlike
,
instinctive
relief
from
the
sense
of
uneasiness
in
this
exertion
,
when
she
saw
it
was
Dr.
Kenn
's
face
that
was
looking
at
her
;
<EOS>
that
plain
,
middle
-
aged
face
,
with
a
grave
,
penetrating
kindness
in
it
,
seeming
to
tell
of
a
human
being
who
had
reached
a
firm
,
safe
strand
,
but
was
looking
with
helpful
pity
toward
the
strugglers
still
tossed
by
the
waves
,
had
an
effect
on
Maggie
at
this
moment
which
was
afterward
remembered
by
her
as
if
it
had
been
a
promise
.
<EOS>
The
middle
-
aged
,
who
have
lived
through
their
strongest
emotions
,
but
are
yet
in
the
time
when
memory
is
still
half
passionate
and
not
merely
contemplative
,
should
surely
be
a
sort
of
natural
priesthood
,
whom
life
has
disciplined
and
consecrated
to
be
the
refuge
and
rescue
of
early
stumblers
and
victims
of
self
-
despair
.
<EOS>
Most
of
us
,
at
some
moment
in
our
young
lives
,
would
have
welcomed
a
priest
of
that
natural
order
in
any
sort
of
canonicals
or
uncanonicals
,
but
had
to
scramble
upward
into
all
the
difficulties
of
nineteen
entirely
without
such
aid
,
as
Maggie
did
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
find
your
office
rather
a
fatiguing
one
,
I
fear
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
"
said
Dr.
Kenn
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
rather
,
"
said
Maggie
,
simply
,
not
being
accustomed
to
simpler
amiable
denials
of
obvious
facts
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
can
tell
Mrs.
Kenn
that
you
have
disposed
of
her
goods
very
quickly
,
"
he
added
;
"
she
will
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
have
done
nothing
;
the
gentlemen
came
very
fast
to
buy
the
dressing
-
gowns
and
embroidered
waistcoats
,
but
I
think
any
of
the
other
ladies
would
have
sold
more
;
I
did
n't
know
what
to
say
about
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Kenn
smiled
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
'm
going
to
have
you
as
a
permanent
parishioner
now
,
Miss
Tulliver
;
am
I
?
<EOS>
You
have
been
at
a
distance
from
us
hitherto
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
a
teacher
in
a
school
,
and
I
'm
going
into
another
situation
of
the
same
kind
very
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
?
<EOS>
I
was
hoping
you
would
remain
among
your
friends
,
who
are
all
in
this
neighborhood
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
_
I
must
go
_
,
"
said
Maggie
,
earnestly
,
looking
at
Dr.
Kenn
with
an
expression
of
reliance
,
as
if
she
had
told
him
her
history
in
those
three
words
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
those
moments
of
implicit
revelation
which
will
sometimes
happen
even
between
people
who
meet
quite
transiently
,
 
on
a
mile
's
journey
,
perhaps
,
or
when
resting
by
the
wayside
.
<EOS>
There
is
always
this
possibility
of
a
word
or
look
from
a
stranger
to
keep
alive
the
sense
of
human
brotherhood
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Kenn
's
ear
and
eye
took
in
all
the
signs
that
this
brief
confidence
of
Maggie
's
was
charged
with
meaning
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
"
he
said
;
"
you
feel
it
right
to
go
.
<EOS>
But
that
will
not
prevent
our
meeting
again
,
I
hope
;
it
will
not
prevent
my
knowing
you
better
,
if
I
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
out
his
hand
and
pressed
hers
kindly
before
he
turned
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
some
trouble
or
other
at
heart
,
"
he
thought
.
<EOS>
"
Poor
child
!
<EOS>
she
looks
as
if
she
might
turn
out
to
be
one
of
    
"
The
souls
by
nature
pitched
too
high
,
  
<EOS>
By
suffering
plunged
too
low
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
something
wonderfully
honest
in
those
beautiful
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
surprising
that
Maggie
,
among
whose
many
imperfections
an
excessive
delight
in
admiration
and
acknowledged
supremacy
were
not
absent
now
,
any
more
than
when
she
was
instructing
the
gypsies
with
a
view
toward
achieving
a
royal
position
among
them
,
was
not
more
elated
on
a
day
when
she
had
had
the
tribute
of
so
many
looks
and
smiles
,
together
with
that
satisfactory
consciousness
which
had
necessarily
come
from
being
taken
before
Lucy
's
chevalglass
,
and
made
to
look
at
the
full
length
of
her
tall
beauty
,
crowned
by
the
night
of
her
massy
hair
.
<EOS>
Maggie
had
smiled
at
herself
then
,
and
for
the
moment
had
forgotten
everything
in
the
sense
of
her
own
beauty
.
<EOS>
If
that
state
of
mind
could
have
lasted
,
her
choice
would
have
been
to
have
Stephen
Guest
at
her
feet
,
offering
her
a
life
filled
with
all
luxuries
,
with
daily
incense
of
adoration
near
and
distant
,
and
with
all
possibilities
of
culture
at
her
command
.
<EOS>
But
there
were
things
in
her
stronger
than
vanity
,
 
passion
and
affection
,
and
long
,
deep
memories
of
early
discipline
and
effort
,
of
early
claims
on
her
love
and
pity
;
and
the
stream
of
vanity
was
soon
swept
along
and
mingled
imperceptibly
with
that
wider
current
which
was
at
its
highest
force
today
,
under
the
double
urgency
of
the
events
and
inward
impulses
brought
by
the
last
week
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
had
not
spoken
to
her
himself
about
the
removal
of
obstacles
between
them
on
his
father
's
side
,
 
he
shrank
from
that
;
but
he
had
told
everything
to
Lucy
,
with
the
hope
that
Maggie
,
being
informed
through
her
,
might
give
him
some
encouraging
sign
that
their
being
brought
thus
much
nearer
to
each
other
<EOS>
was
a
happiness
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
rush
of
conflicting
feelings
was
too
great
for
Maggie
to
say
much
when
Lucy
,
with
a
face
breathing
playful
joy
,
like
one
of
Correggio
's
cherubs
,
poured
forth
her
triumphant
revelation
;
and
Lucy
could
hardly
be
surprised
that
she
could
do
little
more
than
cry
with
gladness
at
the
thought
of
her
father
's
wish
being
fulfilled
,
and
of
Tom
's
getting
the
Mill
again
in
reward
for
all
his
hard
striving
.
<EOS>
The
details
of
preparation
for
the
bazaar
had
then
come
to
usurp
Lucy
's
attention
for
the
next
few
days
,
and
nothing
had
been
said
by
the
cousins
on
subjects
that
were
likely
to
rouse
deeper
feelings
.
<EOS>
Philip
had
been
to
the
house
more
than
once
,
but
Maggie
had
had
no
private
conversation
with
him
,
and
thus
she
had
been
left
to
fight
her
inward
battle
without
interference
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
the
bazaar
was
fairly
ended
,
and
the
cousins
were
alone
again
,
resting
together
at
home
,
Lucy
said
,
    
"
You
must
give
up
going
to
stay
with
your
aunt
Moss
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
,
Maggie
;
write
a
note
to
her
,
and
tell
her
you
have
put
it
off
at
my
request
,
and
I
'll
send
the
man
with
it
.
<EOS>
She
wo
n't
be
displeased
;
you
'll
have
plenty
of
time
to
go
by
-
and
-
by
;
and
I
do
n't
want
you
to
go
out
of
the
way
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
I
must
go
,
dear
;
I
ca
n't
put
it
off
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
leave
aunt
Gritty
out
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
And
I
shall
have
very
little
time
,
for
I
'm
going
away
to
a
new
situation
on
the
25th
of
June
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
!
<EOS>
"
said
Lucy
,
almost
white
with
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
tell
you
,
dear
,
"
said
Maggie
,
making
a
great
effort
to
command
herself
,
"
because
you
've
been
so
busy
.
<EOS>
But
some
time
ago
I
wrote
to
our
old
governess
,
Miss
Firniss
,
to
ask
her
to
let
me
know
if
she
met
with
any
situation
that
I
could
fill
,
and
the
other
day
I
had
a
letter
from
her
telling
me
that
I
could
take
three
orphan
pupils
of
hers
to
the
coast
during
the
holidays
,
and
then
make
trial
of
a
situation
with
her
as
teacher
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
yesterday
to
accept
the
offer
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
felt
so
hurt
that
for
some
moments
she
was
unable
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
"
she
said
at
last
,
"
how
could
you
be
so
unkind
to
me
 
not
to
tell
me
 
to
take
_
such
_
a
step
 
and
now
!
"
<EOS>
She
hesitated
a
little
,
and
then
added
,
"
<EOS>
And
Philip
?
<EOS>
I
thought
everything
was
going
to
be
so
happy
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Maggie
,
what
is
the
reason
?
<EOS>
Give
it
up
;
let
me
write
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
now
to
keep
you
and
Philip
apart
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Maggie
,
faintly
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
Tom
's
feeling
.
<EOS>
He
said
I
must
give
him
up
if
I
married
Philip
.
<EOS>
And
I
know
he
will
not
change
 
at
least
not
for
a
long
while
 
unless
something
happened
to
soften
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
talk
to
him
;
he
's
coming
back
this
week
.
<EOS>
And
this
good
news
about
the
Mill
will
soften
him
.
<EOS>
And
I
'll
talk
to
him
about
Philip
.
<EOS>
Tom
's
always
very
compliant
to
me
;
I
do
n't
think
he
's
so
obstinate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
go
,
"
said
Maggie
,
in
a
distressed
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
leave
some
time
to
pack
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
press
me
to
stay
,
dear
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
was
silent
for
two
or
three
minutes
,
looking
away
and
ruminating
.
<EOS>
At
length
she
knelt
down
by
her
cousin
,
and
looking
up
in
her
face
with
anxious
seriousness
,
said
,
    
"
Maggie
,
is
it
that
you
do
n't
love
Philip
well
enough
to
marry
him
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
 
trust
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
held
Lucy
's
hands
tightly
in
silence
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
Her
own
hands
were
quite
cold
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
spoke
,
her
voice
was
quite
clear
and
distinct
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Lucy
,
I
would
choose
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
be
the
best
and
highest
lot
for
me
,
 
to
make
his
life
happy
.
<EOS>
He
loved
me
first
.
<EOS>
No
one
else
could
be
quite
what
he
is
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
divide
myself
from
my
brother
for
life
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
away
,
and
wait
.
<EOS>
Pray
do
n't
speak
to
me
again
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
obeyed
in
pain
and
wonder
.
<EOS>
The
next
word
she
said
was
,
    
"
Well
,
dear
Maggie
,
at
least
you
will
go
to
the
dance
at
Park
House
to
-
morrow
,
and
have
some
music
and
brightness
,
before
you
go
to
pay
these
dull
dutiful
visits
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
here
come
aunty
and
the
tea
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
Spell
Seems
Broken
  
The
suite
of
rooms
opening
into
each
other
at
Park
House
looked
duly
brilliant
with
lights
and
flowers
and
the
personal
splendors
of
sixteen
couples
,
with
attendant
parents
and
guardians
.
<EOS>
The
focus
of
brilliancy
was
the
long
drawing
-
room
,
where
the
dancing
went
forward
,
under
the
inspiration
of
the
grand
piano
;
the
library
,
into
which
it
opened
at
one
end
,
had
the
more
sober
illumination
of
maturity
,
with
caps
and
cards
;
and
at
the
other
end
the
pretty
sitting
-
room
,
with
a
conservatory
attached
,
was
left
as
an
occasional
cool
retreat
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
who
had
laid
aside
her
black
for
the
first
time
,
and
had
her
pretty
slimness
set
off
by
an
abundant
dress
of
white
crape
,
was
the
acknowledged
queen
of
the
occasion
;
for
this
was
one
of
the
Miss
Guests
'
thoroughly
condescending
parties
,
including
no
member
of
any
aristocracy
higher
than
that
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
stretching
to
the
extreme
limits
of
commercial
and
professional
gentility
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
at
first
refused
to
dance
,
saying
that
she
had
forgotten
all
the
figures
 
<EOS>
it
was
so
many
years
since
she
had
danced
at
school
;
and
she
was
glad
to
have
that
excuse
,
for
it
is
<EOS>
ill
dancing
with
a
heavy
heart
.
<EOS>
But
at
length
the
music
wrought
in
her
young
limbs
,
and
the
longing
came
;
even
though
it
was
the
horrible
young
Torry
,
who
walked
up
a
second
time
to
try
and
persuade
her
.
<EOS>
She
warned
him
that
she
could
not
dance
anything
but
a
country
-
dance
;
but
he
,
of
course
,
was
willing
to
wait
for
that
high
felicity
,
meaning
only
to
be
complimentary
when
he
assured
her
at
several
intervals
that
it
was
a
"
great
bore
"
<EOS>
that
she
could
n't
waltz
,
he
would
have
liked
so
much
to
waltz
with
her
.
<EOS>
But
at
last
it
was
the
turn
of
the
good
old
-
fashioned
dance
which
has
the
least
of
vanity
and
the
most
of
merriment
in
it
,
and
Maggie
quite
forgot
her
troublous
life
in
a
childlike
enjoyment
of
that
half
-
rustic
rhythm
which
seems
to
banish
pretentious
etiquette
.
<EOS>
She
felt
quite
charitably
toward
young
Torry
,
as
his
hand
bore
her
along
and
held
her
up
in
the
dance
;
her
eyes
and
cheeks
had
that
fire
of
young
joy
in
them
which
will
flame
out
if
it
can
find
the
least
breath
to
fan
it
;
and
her
simple
black
dress
,
with
its
bit
of
black
lace
,
seemed
like
the
dim
setting
of
a
jewel
.
  
<EOS>
Stephen
had
not
yet
asked
her
to
dance
;
had
not
yet
paid
her
more
than
a
passing
civility
.
<EOS>
Since
yesterday
,
that
inward
vision
of
her
which
perpetually
made
part
of
his
consciousness
,
had
been
half
screened
by
the
image
of
Philip
Wakem
,
which
came
across
it
like
a
blot
;
there
was
some
attachment
between
her
and
Philip
;
at
least
there
was
an
attachment
on
his
side
,
which
made
her
feel
in
some
bondage
.
<EOS>
Here
,
then
,
Stephen
told
himself
,
was
another
claim
of
honor
which
called
on
him
to
resist
the
attraction
that
was
continually
threatening
to
overpower
him
.
<EOS>
He
told
himself
so
;
and
yet
he
had
once
or
twice
felt
a
certain
savage
resistance
,
and
at
another
moment
a
shuddering
repugnance
,
to
this
intrusion
of
Philip
's
image
,
which
almost
made
it
a
new
incitement
to
rush
toward
Maggie
and
claim
her
for
himself
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
had
done
what
he
meant
to
do
this
evening
,
 
he
had
kept
aloof
from
her
;
he
had
hardly
looked
at
her
;
and
he
had
been
gayly
assiduous
to
Lucy
.
<EOS>
But
now
his
eyes
were
devouring
Maggie
;
he
felt
inclined
to
kick
young
Torry
out
of
the
dance
,
and
take
his
place
.
<EOS>
Then
he
wanted
the
dance
to
end
that
he
might
get
rid
of
his
partner
.
<EOS>
The
possibility
that
he
too
should
dance
with
Maggie
,
and
have
her
hand
in
his
so
long
,
was
beginning
to
possess
him
like
a
thirst
.
<EOS>
But
even
now
their
hands
were
meeting
in
the
dance
,
 
were
meeting
still
to
the
very
end
of
it
,
though
they
were
far
off
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
Stephen
hardly
knew
what
happened
,
or
in
what
automatic
way
he
got
through
the
duties
of
politeness
in
the
interval
,
until
he
was
free
and
saw
Maggie
seated
alone
again
,
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
made
his
way
toward
her
round
the
couples
that
were
forming
for
the
waltz
;
and
when
Maggie
became
conscious
that
she
was
the
person
he
sought
,
she
felt
,
in
spite
of
all
the
thoughts
that
had
gone
before
,
a
glowing
gladness
at
heart
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
and
cheeks
were
still
brightened
with
her
childlike
enthusiasm
in
the
dance
;
her
whole
frame
was
set
to
joy
and
tenderness
;
even
the
coming
pain
could
not
seem
bitter
,
 
she
was
ready
to
welcome
it
as
a
part
of
life
,
for
life
at
this
moment
seemed
a
keen
,
vibrating
consciousness
poised
above
pleasure
or
pain
.
<EOS>
This
one
,
this
last
night
,
she
might
expand
unrestrainedly
in
the
warmth
of
the
present
,
without
those
chill
,
eating
thoughts
of
the
past
and
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
going
to
waltz
again
,
"
said
Stephen
,
bending
to
speak
to
her
,
with
that
glance
and
tone
of
subdued
tenderness
which
young
dreams
create
to
themselves
in
the
summer
woods
when
low
,
cooing
voices
fill
the
air
.
<EOS>
Such
glances
and
tones
bring
the
breath
of
poetry
with
them
into
a
room
that
is
half
stifling
with
glaring
gas
and
hard
flirtation
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
going
to
waltz
again
.
<EOS>
It
is
rather
dizzy
work
to
look
on
,
and
the
room
is
very
warm
;
shall
we
walk
about
a
little
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
her
hand
and
placed
it
within
his
arm
,
and
they
walked
on
into
the
sitting
-
room
,
where
the
tables
were
strewn
with
engravings
for
the
accommodation
of
visitors
who
would
not
want
to
look
at
them
.
<EOS>
But
no
visitors
were
here
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
They
passed
on
into
the
conservatory
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
strange
and
unreal
the
trees
and
flowers
look
with
the
lights
among
them
!
"
<EOS>
said
Maggie
,
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
They
look
as
if
they
belonged
to
an
enchanted
land
,
and
would
never
fade
away
;
I
could
fancy
they
were
all
made
of
jewels
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
looking
at
the
tier
of
geraniums
as
she
spoke
,
and
Stephen
made
no
answer
;
but
he
was
looking
at
her
;
and
does
not
a
supreme
poet
blend
light
and
sound
into
one
,
calling
darkness
mute
,
and
light
eloquent
?
<EOS>
Something
strangely
powerful
<EOS>
there
was
in
the
light
of
Stephen
's
long
gaze
,
for
it
made
Maggie
's
face
turn
toward
it
and
look
upward
at
it
,
slowly
,
like
a
flower
at
the
ascending
brightness
.
<EOS>
And
they
walked
unsteadily
on
,
without
feeling
that
they
were
walking
;
without
feeling
anything
but
that
long
,
grave
,
mutual
gaze
which
has
the
solemnity
belonging
to
all
deep
human
passion
.
<EOS>
The
hovering
thought
that
they
must
and
would
renounce
each
other
made
this
moment
of
mute
confession
more
intense
in
its
rapture
.
  
<EOS>
But
they
had
reached
the
end
of
the
conservatory
,
and
were
obliged
to
pause
and
turn
.
<EOS>
The
change
of
movement
brought
a
new
consciousness
to
Maggie
;
she
blushed
deeply
,
turned
away
her
head
,
and
drew
her
arm
from
Stephen
's
,
going
up
to
some
flowers
to
smell
them
.
<EOS>
Stephen
stood
motionless
,
and
still
pale
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
may
I
get
this
rose
?
"
said
Maggie
,
making
a
great
effort
to
say
something
,
and
dissipate
the
burning
sense
of
irretrievable
confession
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
am
quite
wicked
with
roses
;
I
like
to
gather
them
and
smell
them
till
they
have
no
scent
left
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
was
mute
;
he
was
incapable
of
putting
a
sentence
together
,
and
Maggie
bent
her
arm
a
little
upward
toward
the
large
half
-
opened
rose
that
had
attracted
her
.
<EOS>
Who
has
not
felt
the
beauty
of
a
woman
's
arm
?
<EOS>
The
unspeakable
suggestions
of
tenderness
that
lie
in
the
dimpled
elbow
,
and
all
the
varied
gently
lessening
curves
,
down
to
the
delicate
wrist
,
with
its
tiniest
,
almost
imperceptible
nicks
in
the
firm
softness
.
<EOS>
A
woman
's
arm
touched
the
soul
of
a
great
sculptor
two
thousand
years
ago
,
so
that
he
wrought
an
image
of
it
for
the
Parthenon
which
moves
us
still
as
it
clasps
lovingly
the
timeworn
marble
of
a
headless
trunk
.
<EOS>
Maggie
's
was
such
an
arm
as
that
,
and
it
had
the
warm
tints
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
A
mad
impulse
seized
on
Stephen
;
he
darted
toward
the
arm
,
and
showered
kisses
on
it
,
clasping
the
wrist
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
next
moment
Maggie
snatched
it
from
him
,
and
glared
at
him
like
a
wounded
war
-
goddess
,
quivering
with
rage
and
humiliation
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
?
"
<EOS>
She
spoke
in
a
deeply
shaken
,
half
-
smothered
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
right
have
I
given
you
to
insult
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
darted
from
him
into
the
adjoining
room
,
and
threw
herself
on
the
sofa
,
panting
and
trembling
.
  
<EOS>
A
horrible
punishment
was
come
upon
her
for
the
sin
of
allowing
a
moment
's
happiness
that
was
treachery
to
Lucy
,
to
Philip
,
to
her
own
better
soul
.
<EOS>
That
momentary
happiness
had
been
smitten
with
a
blight
,
a
leprosy
;
Stephen
thought
more
lightly
of
_
her
_
than
he
did
of
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
Stephen
,
he
leaned
back
against
the
framework
of
the
conservatory
,
dizzy
with
the
conflict
of
passions
,
 
love
,
rage
,
and
confused
despair
;
<EOS>
despair
at
his
want
of
self
-
mastery
,
and
despair
that
he
had
offended
Maggie
.
  
<EOS>
The
last
feeling
surmounted
every
other
;
to
be
by
her
side
again
and
entreat
forgiveness
was
the
only
thing
that
had
the
force
of
a
motive
for
him
,
and
she
had
not
been
seated
more
than
a
few
minutes
when
he
came
and
stood
humbly
before
her
.
<EOS>
But
Maggie
's
bitter
rage
was
unspent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Leave
me
to
myself
,
if
you
please
,
"
she
said
,
with
impetuous
haughtiness
,
"
and
for
the
future
avoid
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
turned
away
,
and
walked
backward
and
forward
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
dire
necessity
of
going
back
into
the
dancing
-
room
again
,
and
he
was
beginning
to
be
conscious
of
that
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
absent
so
short
a
time
,
that
when
he
went
in
again
the
waltz
was
not
ended
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
,
too
,
was
not
long
before
she
re
-
entered
.
<EOS>
All
the
pride
of
her
nature
was
stung
into
activity
;
the
hateful
weakness
which
had
dragged
her
within
reach
of
this
wound
to
her
self
-
respect
had
at
least
wrought
its
own
cure
.
<EOS>
The
thoughts
and
temptations
of
the
last
month
should
all
be
flung
away
into
an
unvisited
chamber
of
memory
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
to
allure
her
now
;
duty
would
be
easy
,
and
all
the
old
calm
purposes
would
reign
peacefully
once
more
.
<EOS>
She
re
-
entered
the
drawing
-
room
still
with
some
excited
brightness
in
her
face
,
but
with
a
sense
of
proud
self
-
command
that
defied
anything
to
agitate
her
.
<EOS>
She
refused
to
dance
again
,
but
she
talked
quite
readily
and
calmly
with
every
one
who
addressed
her
.
<EOS>
And
when
they
got
home
that
night
,
she
kissed
Lucy
with
a
free
heart
,
almost
exulting
in
this
scorching
moment
,
which
had
delivered
her
from
the
possibility
of
another
word
or
look
that
would
have
the
stamp
of
treachery
toward
that
gentle
,
unsuspicious
sister
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
Maggie
did
not
set
off
to
Basset
quite
so
soon
as
she
had
expected
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
was
to
accompany
her
in
the
carriage
,
and
household
business
could
not
be
dispatched
hastily
by
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
So
Maggie
,
who
had
been
in
a
hurry
to
prepare
herself
,
had
to
sit
waiting
,
equipped
for
the
drive
,
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Lucy
was
busy
in
the
house
wrapping
up
some
bazaar
presents
for
the
younger
ones
at
Basset
,
and
when
there
was
a
loud
ring
at
the
door
-
bell
,
Maggie
felt
some
alarm
lest
Lucy
should
bring
out
Stephen
to
her
;
it
was
sure
to
be
Stephen
.
  
<EOS>
But
presently
the
visitor
came
out
into
the
garden
alone
,
and
seated
himself
by
her
on
the
garden
-
chair
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
Stephen
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
just
catch
the
tips
of
the
Scotch
firs
,
Maggie
,
from
this
seat
,
"
said
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
taken
each
other
's
hands
in
silence
,
but
Maggie
had
looked
at
him
with
a
more
complete
revival
of
the
old
childlike
<EOS>
affectionate
smile
than
he
had
seen
before
,
and
<EOS>
he
felt
encouraged
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
often
look
at
them
,
and
wish
I
could
see
the
low
sunlight
on
the
stems
again
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
never
been
that
way
<EOS>
but
once
,
 
to
the
churchyard
with
my
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
there
,
I
go
there
,
continually
,
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
but
the
past
to
live
upon
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
keen
remembrance
and
keen
pity
impelled
Maggie
to
put
her
hand
in
Philip
's
.
<EOS>
They
had
so
often
walked
hand
in
hand
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
all
the
spots
,
"
she
said
,
 
"
just
where
you
told
me
of
particular
things
,
beautiful
stories
that
I
had
never
heard
of
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
go
there
again
soon
,
wo
n't
you
,
Maggie
?
"
said
Philip
,
getting
timid
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Mill
will
soon
be
your
brother
's
home
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
but
I
shall
not
be
there
,
"
said
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
only
hear
of
that
happiness
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
away
again
;
Lucy
has
not
told
you
,
perhaps
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
the
future
will
never
join
on
to
the
past
again
,
Maggie
?
<EOS>
That
book
is
quite
closed
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
gray
eyes
that
had
so
often
looked
up
at
her
with
entreating
worship
,
looked
up
at
her
now
,
with
a
last
struggling
ray
of
hope
in
them
,
and
Maggie
met
them
with
her
large
sincere
gaze
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
book
never
will
be
closed
,
Philip
,
"
she
said
,
with
grave
sadness
;
"
I
desire
no
future
that
will
break
the
ties
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
But
the
tie
to
my
brother
is
one
of
the
strongest
.
<EOS>
I
can
do
nothing
willingly
that
will
divide
me
always
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
the
only
reason
that
would
keep
us
apart
forever
,
Maggie
?
"
said
Philip
,
with
a
desperate
determination
to
have
a
definite
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
only
reason
,
"
said
Maggie
,
with
calm
decision
.
<EOS>
And
she
believed
it
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
she
felt
as
if
the
enchanted
cup
had
been
dashed
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
The
reactionary
excitement
that
gave
her
a
proud
self
-
mastery
had
not
subsided
,
and
she
looked
at
the
future
with
a
sense
of
calm
choice
.
  
<EOS>
They
sat
hand
in
hand
without
looking
at
each
other
or
speaking
for
a
few
minutes
;
in
Maggie
's
mind
the
first
scenes
of
love
and
parting
were
more
present
than
the
actual
moment
,
and
she
was
looking
at
Philip
in
the
Red
Deeps
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
felt
that
he
ought
to
have
been
thoroughly
happy
in
that
answer
of
hers
;
she
was
as
open
and
transparent
as
a
rock
-
pool
.
<EOS>
Why
was
he
not
thoroughly
happy
?
<EOS>
Jealousy
is
never
satisfied
with
anything
short
of
an
omniscience
that
would
detect
the
subtlest
fold
of
the
heart
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
Lane
  
Maggie
had
been
four
days
at
<EOS>
her
aunt
Moss
's
giving
the
early
June
sunshine
quite
a
new
brightness
in
the
care
-
dimmed
eyes
of
that
affectionate
woman
,
and
making
an
epoch
for
her
cousins
great
and
small
,
who
were
learning
her
words
and
actions
by
heart
,
as
if
she
had
been
a
transient
avatar
of
perfect
wisdom
and
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
standing
on
the
causeway
with
her
aunt
and
a
group
of
cousins
feeding
the
chickens
,
at
that
quiet
moment
in
the
life
of
the
farmyards
before
the
afternoon
milking
-
time
.
<EOS>
The
great
buildings
round
the
hollow
yard
were
as
dreary
and
tumbledown
as
ever
,
but
over
the
old
garden
-
wall
<EOS>
the
straggling
rose
-
bushes
were
beginning
to
toss
their
summer
weight
,
and
the
gray
wood
and
old
bricks
of
the
house
,
on
its
higher
level
,
had
a
look
of
sleepy
age
in
the
broad
afternoon
sunlight
,
that
suited
the
quiescent
time
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
with
her
bonnet
over
her
arm
,
was
smiling
down
at
the
hatch
of
small
fluffy
chickens
,
when
her
aunt
exclaimed
,
    
"
Goodness
me
!
<EOS>
who
is
that
gentleman
coming
in
at
the
gate
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
gentleman
on
a
tall
bay
horse
;
and
the
flanks
and
neck
of
the
horse
were
streaked
black
with
fast
riding
.
<EOS>
Maggie
felt
a
beating
at
head
and
heart
,
horrible
as
the
sudden
leaping
to
life
of
a
savage
enemy
who
had
feigned
death
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
,
my
dear
?
"
said
Mrs.
Moss
,
seeing
in
Maggie
's
face
the
evidence
that
she
knew
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
,
"
said
Maggie
,
rather
faintly
.
<EOS>
"
My
cousin
Lucy
's
 
a
gentleman
who
is
very
intimate
at
my
cousin
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
was
already
close
to
them
,
had
jumped
off
his
horse
,
and
now
raised
his
hat
as
he
advanced
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hold
the
horse
,
Willy
,
"
said
Mrs.
Moss
to
the
twelve
-
year
-
old
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
,
"
said
Stephen
,
pulling
at
the
horse
's
impatiently
tossing
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
be
going
again
immediately
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
message
to
deliver
to
you
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
on
private
business
.
<EOS>
May
I
take
the
liberty
of
asking
you
to
walk
a
few
yards
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
a
half
-
jaded
,
half
-
irritated
look
,
such
as
a
man
gets
when
he
has
been
dogged
by
some
care
or
annoyance
that
makes
his
bed
and
his
dinner
of
little
use
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
almost
abruptly
,
as
if
his
errand
were
too
pressing
for
him
to
trouble
himself
about
what
would
be
thought
by
Mrs.
Moss
of
his
visit
and
request
.
<EOS>
Good
Mrs.
Moss
,
rather
nervous
in
the
presence
of
this
apparently
haughty
gentleman
,
was
inwardly
wondering
whether
she
would
be
doing
right
or
wrong
to
invite
him
again
to
leave
his
horse
and
walk
in
,
when
Maggie
,
feeling
all
the
embarrassment
of
the
situation
,
and
unable
to
say
anything
,
put
on
her
bonnet
,
and
turned
to
walk
toward
the
gate
.
  
<EOS>
Stephen
turned
too
,
and
walked
by
her
side
,
leading
his
horse
.
  
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
spoken
till
they
were
out
in
the
lane
,
and
had
walked
four
or
five
yards
,
when
Maggie
,
who
had
been
looking
straight
before
her
all
the
while
,
turned
again
to
walk
back
,
saying
,
with
haughty
resentment
,
    
"
There
is
no
need
for
me
to
go
any
farther
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
consider
it
gentlemanly
and
delicate
conduct
to
place
me
in
a
position
that
forced
me
to
come
out
with
you
,
or
whether
you
wished
to
insult
me
still
further
by
thrusting
an
interview
upon
me
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
are
angry
with
me
for
coming
,
"
said
Stephen
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
it
is
of
no
consequence
what
a
man
has
to
suffer
;
it
is
only
your
woman
's
dignity
that
you
care
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
gave
a
slight
start
,
such
as
might
have
come
from
the
slightest
possible
electric
shock
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
if
it
were
not
enough
that
I
'm
entangled
in
this
way
;
that
I
'm
mad
with
love
for
you
;
that
I
resist
the
strongest
passion
a
man
can
feel
,
because
I
try
to
be
true
to
other
claims
;
but
you
must
treat
me
as
if
I
were
a
coarse
brute
,
who
would
willingly
offend
you
.
<EOS>
And
when
,
if
I
had
my
own
choice
,
I
should
ask
you
to
take
my
hand
and
my
fortune
and
my
whole
life
,
and
do
what
you
liked
with
them
!
<EOS>
I
know
I
forgot
myself
.
<EOS>
I
took
an
unwarrantable
liberty
.
<EOS>
I
hate
myself
for
having
done
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
repented
immediately
;
I
've
been
repenting
ever
since
.
<EOS>
You
ought
not
to
think
it
unpardonable
;
a
man
who
loves
with
his
whole
soul
,
as
I
do
you
,
is
liable
to
be
mastered
by
his
feelings
for
a
moment
;
but
you
know
 
you
must
believe
 
that
the
worst
pain
I
could
have
is
to
have
pained
you
;
that
I
would
give
the
world
to
recall
the
error
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
dared
not
speak
,
dared
not
turn
her
head
.
<EOS>
The
strength
that
had
come
from
resentment
was
all
gone
,
and
her
lips
were
quivering
visibly
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
trust
herself
to
utter
the
full
forgiveness
that
rose
in
answer
to
that
confession
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
come
nearly
in
front
of
the
gate
again
,
and
she
paused
,
trembling
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
say
these
things
;
I
must
not
hear
them
,
"
she
said
,
looking
down
in
misery
,
as
Stephen
came
in
front
of
her
,
to
prevent
her
from
going
farther
toward
the
gate
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
sorry
for
any
pain
you
have
to
go
through
;
but
it
is
of
no
use
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
_
is
_
of
use
,
"
said
Stephen
,
impetuously
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
of
use
if
you
would
treat
me
with
some
sort
of
pity
and
consideration
,
instead
of
doing
me
vile
injustice
in
your
mind
.
<EOS>
I
could
bear
everything
more
quietly
if
I
knew
you
did
n't
hate
me
for
an
insolent
coxcomb
.
<EOS>
Look
at
me
;
see
what
a
hunted
devil
I
am
;
I
've
been
riding
thirty
miles
every
day
to
get
away
from
the
thought
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
did
not
 
dared
not
 
look
.
<EOS>
She
had
already
seen
the
harassed
face
.
<EOS>
But
she
said
gently
,
    
"
I
do
n't
think
any
evil
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
dearest
,
look
at
me
,
"
said
Stephen
,
in
deepest
,
tenderest
tones
of
entreaty
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
go
away
from
me
yet
.
<EOS>
Give
me
a
moment
's
happiness
;
make
me
feel
you
've
forgiven
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
forgive
you
,
"
said
Maggie
,
shaken
by
those
tones
,
and
all
the
more
frightened
at
herself
.
<EOS>
"
But
pray
let
me
go
in
again
.
<EOS>
Pray
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
great
tear
fell
from
under
her
lowered
eyelids
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
go
away
from
you
;
I
ca
n't
leave
you
,
"
said
Stephen
,
with
still
more
passionate
pleading
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
come
back
again
if
you
send
me
away
with
this
coldness
;
I
ca
n't
answer
for
myself
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
will
go
with
me
only
a
little
way
I
can
live
on
that
.
<EOS>
You
see
plainly
enough
that
your
anger
has
only
made
me
ten
times
more
unreasonable
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
turned
.
<EOS>
But
Tancred
,
the
bay
horse
,
began
to
make
such
spirited
remonstrances
against
this
frequent
change
of
direction
,
that
Stephen
,
catching
sight
of
Willy
Moss
peeping
through
the
gate
,
called
out
,
"
Here
!
<EOS>
just
come
and
hold
my
horse
for
five
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
"
said
Maggie
,
hurriedly
,
"
my
aunt
will
think
it
so
strange
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
Stephen
answered
impatiently
;
"
they
do
n't
know
the
people
at
St.
Ogg
's
.
<EOS>
Lead
him
up
and
down
just
here
for
five
minutes
,
"
he
added
to
Willy
,
who
was
now
close
to
them
;
and
then
he
turned
to
Maggie
's
side
,
and
they
walked
on
.
<EOS>
It
was
clear
that
she
_
must
_
go
on
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
my
arm
,
"
said
Stephen
,
entreatingly
;
and
she
took
it
,
feeling
all
the
while
as
if
she
were
sliding
downward
in
a
nightmare
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
end
to
this
misery
,
"
she
began
,
struggling
to
repel
the
influence
by
speech
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
wicked
 
base
 
ever
allowing
a
word
or
look
that
Lucy
 
that
others
might
not
have
seen
.
<EOS>
Think
of
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
think
of
her
 
bless
her
.
<EOS>
If
I
did
n't
   
"
Stephen
had
laid
his
hand
on
Maggie
's
that
rested
on
his
arm
,
and
they
both
felt
it
difficult
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
have
other
ties
,
"
Maggie
went
on
,
at
last
,
with
a
desperate
effort
,
"
even
if
Lucy
did
not
exist
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
engaged
to
Philip
Wakem
?
"
said
Stephen
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
consider
myself
engaged
to
him
;
I
do
n't
mean
to
marry
any
one
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
was
silent
again
until
they
had
turned
out
of
the
sun
into
a
side
lane
,
all
grassy
and
sheltered
.
<EOS>
Then
he
burst
out
impetuously
,
    
<EOS>
"
It
is
unnatural
,
it
is
horrible
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
if
you
loved
me
as
I
love
you
,
we
should
throw
everything
else
to
the
winds
for
the
sake
of
belonging
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
We
should
break
all
these
mistaken
ties
that
were
made
in
blindness
,
and
determine
to
marry
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
die
than
fall
into
that
temptation
,
"
said
Maggie
,
with
deep
,
slow
distinctness
,
all
the
gathered
spiritual
force
of
painful
years
coming
to
her
aid
in
this
extremity
.
<EOS>
She
drew
her
arm
from
his
as
she
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
then
,
that
you
do
n't
care
for
me
,
"
he
said
,
almost
violently
.
"
<EOS>
Tell
me
that
you
love
some
one
else
better
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
darted
through
Maggie
's
mind
that
here
was
a
mode
of
releasing
herself
from
outward
struggle
,
 
to
tell
Stephen
that
her
whole
heart
was
Philip
's
.
<EOS>
But
her
lips
would
not
utter
that
,
and
she
was
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
love
me
,
dearest
,
"
said
Stephen
,
gently
,
taking
her
hand
again
and
laying
it
within
his
arm
,
"
it
is
better
 
<EOS>
it
is
right
that
we
should
marry
each
other
.
<EOS>
We
ca
n't
help
the
pain
it
will
give
.
<EOS>
It
is
come
upon
us
without
our
seeking
;
it
is
natural
;
it
has
taken
hold
of
me
in
spite
of
every
effort
I
have
made
to
resist
it
.
<EOS>
God
knows
,
I
've
been
trying
to
be
faithful
to
tacit
engagements
,
and
I
've
only
made
things
worse
;
I
'd
better
have
given
way
at
first
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
was
silent
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
_
not
_
wrong
 
if
she
were
once
convinced
of
that
,
and
need
no
longer
beat
and
struggle
against
this
current
,
soft
and
yet
strong
as
the
summer
stream
!
  
<EOS>
"
Say've
s
"
dearest
,
"
said
Stephen
,
leaning
to
look
entreatingly
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
What
could
we
care
about
in
the
whole
world
beside
,
if
we
belonged
to
each
other
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
breath
was
on
his
face
,
his
lips
were
very
near
hers
,
but
there
was
a
great
dread
dwelling
in
his
love
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
Her
lips
and
eyelids
quivered
;
she
opened
her
eyes
full
on
his
for
an
instant
,
like
a
lovely
wild
animal
timid
and
struggling
under
caresses
,
and
then
turned
sharp
round
toward
home
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
after
all
,
"
he
went
on
,
in
an
impatient
tone
,
trying
to
defeat
his
own
scruples
as
well
as
hers
,
"
I
am
breaking
no
positive
engagement
;
if
Lucy
's
affections
had
been
withdrawn
from
me
and
given
to
some
one
else
,
I
should
have
felt
no
right
to
assert
a
claim
on
her
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
not
absolutely
pledged
to
Philip
,
we
are
neither
of
us
bound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
believe
that
;
it
is
not
your
real
feeling
,
"
said
Maggie
,
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
You
feel
,
as
I
do
,
that
the
real
tie
lies
in
the
feelings
and
expectations
we
have
raised
in
other
minds
.
<EOS>
Else
all
pledges
might
be
broken
,
when
there
was
no
outward
penalty
.
<EOS>
There
would
be
no
such
thing
as
faithfulness
.
"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
was
silent
;
he
could
not
pursue
that
argument
;
the
opposite
conviction
had
wrought
in
him
too
strongly
through
his
previous
time
of
struggle
.
<EOS>
But
it
soon
presented
itself
in
a
new
form
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
pledge
_
ca
n't
_
be
fulfilled
,
"
he
said
,
with
impetuous
insistence
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
unnatural
;
we
can
only
pretend
to
give
ourselves
to
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
There
is
wrong
in
that
too
;
there
may
be
misery
in
it
for
_
them
_
as
well
as
for
us
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
you
must
see
that
;
you
do
see
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
looking
eagerly
at
her
face
for
the
least
sign
of
compliance
;
his
large
,
firm
,
gentle
grasp
was
on
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
;
then
she
drew
a
deep
breath
,
and
said
,
looking
up
at
him
with
solemn
sadness
,
    
"
Oh
,
it
is
difficult
,
 
<EOS>
life
is
very
difficult
!
<EOS>
It
seems
right
to
me
sometimes
that
we
should
follow
our
strongest
feeling
;
but
then
,
such
feelings
continually
come
across
the
ties
that
all
our
former
life
has
made
for
us
,
 
the
ties
that
have
made
others
dependent
on
us
,
 
and
would
cut
them
in
two
.
<EOS>
If
life
were
quite
easy
and
simple
,
as
it
might
have
been
in
Paradise
,
and
we
could
always
see
that
one
being
first
toward
whom
 
I
mean
,
if
life
did
not
make
duties
for
us
before
love
comes
,
love
would
be
a
sign
that
two
people
ought
to
belong
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
But
I
see
 
I
feel
it
is
not
so
now
;
there
are
things
we
must
renounce
in
life
;
some
of
us
must
resign
love
.
<EOS>
Many
things
are
difficult
and
dark
to
me
;
but
I
see
one
thing
quite
clearly
,
 
that
I
must
not
,
can
not
,
seek
my
own
happiness
by
sacrificing
others
.
<EOS>
Love
is
natural
;
but
surely
pity
and
faithfulness
and
memory
are
natural
too
.
<EOS>
And
they
would
live
in
me
still
,
and
punish
me
if
I
did
not
obey
them
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
haunted
by
the
suffering
I
had
caused
.
<EOS>
Our
love
would
be
poisoned
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
urge
me
;
help
me
,
 
help
me
,
_
because
_
I
love
you
.

<EOS>
Maggie
had
become
more
and
more
earnest
as
she
went
on
;
her
face
had
become
flushed
,
and
her
eyes
fuller
and
fuller
of
appealing
love
.
<EOS>
Stephen
had
the
fibre
of
nobleness
in
him
that
vibrated
to
her
appeal
;
but
in
the
same
moment
 
how
could
it
be
otherwise
?
 
<EOS>
that
pleading
beauty
gained
new
power
over
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dearest
,
"
he
said
,
in
scarcely
more
than
a
whisper
,
while
his
arm
stole
round
her
,
"
I
'll
do
,
I
'll
bear
anything
you
wish
.
<EOS>
But
 
one
kiss
 
one
 
the
last
 
before
we
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
One
kiss
,
and
then
a
long
look
,
until
Maggie
said
tremulously
<EOS>
,
"
Let
me
go
,
 
let
me
make
haste
back
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
hurried
along
,
and
not
another
word
was
spoken
.
<EOS>
Stephen
stood
still
and
beckoned
when
they
came
within
sight
of
Willy
and
the
horse
,
and
Maggie
went
on
through
the
gate
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Moss
was
standing
alone
at
the
door
of
the
old
porch
;
she
had
sent
all
the
cousins
in
,
with
kind
thoughtfulness
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
a
joyful
thing
that
Maggie
had
a
rich
and
handsome
lover
,
but
she
would
naturally
feel
embarrassed
at
coming
in
again
;
and
it
might
_
not
_
be
joyful
.
<EOS>
In
either
case
Mrs.
Moss
waited
anxiously
to
receive
Maggie
by
herself
.
<EOS>
The
speaking
face
told
plainly
enough
that
,
if
there
was
joy
,
it
was
of
a
very
agitating
,
dubious
sort
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
here
a
bit
,
my
dear
.
"
<EOS>
She
drew
Maggie
into
the
porch
,
and
sat
down
on
the
bench
by
her
;
there
was
no
privacy
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
aunt
Gritty
,
I
'm
very
wretched
!
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
have
died
when
I
was
fifteen
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
so
easy
to
give
things
up
then
;
it
is
so
hard
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
poor
child
threw
her
arms
round
her
aunt
's
neck
,
and
fell
into
long
,
deep
sobs
.
    
<EOS>
A
Family
Party
  
<EOS>
Maggie
left
her
good
aunt
Gritty
at
the
end
of
the
week
,
and
went
to
Garum
Firs
to
pay
her
visit
to
aunt
Pullet
according
to
agreement
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
very
unexpected
things
had
happened
,
and
there
was
to
be
a
family
party
at
Garum
to
discuss
and
celebrate
a
change
in
the
fortunes
of
the
Tullivers
,
which
was
likely
finally
to
carry
away
the
shadow
of
their
demerits
like
the
last
limb
of
an
eclipse
,
and
cause
their
hitherto
obscured
virtues
to
shine
forth
in
full
-
rounded
splendor
.
<EOS>
It
is
pleasant
to
know
that
a
new
ministry
just
come
into
office
are
not
the
only
fellow
-
men
who
enjoy
a
period
of
high
appreciation
and
full
-
blown
eulogy
;
in
many
respectable
families
throughout
this
realm
,
relatives
becoming
creditable
meet
with
a
similar
cordiality
of
recognition
,
which
in
its
fine
freedom
from
the
coercion
of
any
antecedents
,
suggests
the
hopeful
possibility
that
we
may
some
day
without
any
notice
find
ourselves
in
full
millennium
,
with
cockatrices
who
have
ceased
to
bite
,
and
wolves
that
no
longer
show
their
teeth
with
any
but
the
blandest
intentions
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
came
so
early
as
to
have
the
start
even
of
aunt
Glegg
;
for
she
longed
to
have
some
undisturbed
talk
with
Maggie
about
the
wonderful
news
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
,
did
it
not
?
<EOS>
said
Lucy
,
with
her
prettiest
air
of
wisdom
,
as
if
everything
,
even
other
people
's
misfortunes
(
poor
creatures
!
)
<EOS>
were
conspiring
now
to
make
poor
dear
aunt
Tulliver
,
and
cousin
Tom
,
and
naughty
Maggie
too
,
if
she
were
not
obstinately
bent
on
the
contrary
,
as
happy
as
they
deserved
to
be
after
all
their
troubles
.
<EOS>
To
think
that
the
very
day
 
the
_
very
day
_
 
after
Tom
had
come
back
from
Newcastle
,
that
unfortunate
young
Jetsome
,
whom
Mr.
Wakem
had
placed
at
the
Mill
,
had
been
pitched
off
his
horse
in
a
drunken
fit
,
and
was
lying
at
St.
Ogg
's
in
a
dangerous
state
,
so
that
Wakem
had
signified
his
wish
that
the
new
purchasers
should
enter
on
the
premises
at
once
!
  
<EOS>
It
was
very
dreadful
for
that
unhappy
young
man
,
but
it
did
seem
as
if
the
misfortune
had
happened
then
,
rather
than
at
any
other
time
,
in
order
that
cousin
Tom
<EOS>
might
all
the
sooner
have
the
fit
reward
of
his
exemplary
conduct
,
 
<EOS>
papa
thought
so
very
highly
of
him
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Tulliver
must
certainly
go
to
the
Mill
now
,
and
keep
house
for
Tom
;
that
was
rather
a
loss
to
Lucy
in
the
matter
of
household
comfort
;
but
then
,
to
think
of
poor
aunty
being
in
her
old
place
again
,
and
gradually
getting
comforts
about
her
there
!
  
<EOS>
On
this
last
point
Lucy
had
her
cunning
projects
,
and
when
she
and
Maggie
had
made
their
dangerous
way
down
the
bright
stairs
into
the
handsome
parlor
,
where
the
very
sunbeams
seemed
cleaner
than
elsewhere
,
she
directed
her
manœuvres
,
as
any
other
great
tactician
would
have
done
,
against
the
weaker
side
of
the
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aunt
Pullet
,
"
she
said
,
seating
herself
on
the
sofa
,
and
caressingly
adjusting
that
lady
's
floating
cap
-
string
,
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
make
up
your
mind
<EOS>
what
linen
and
things
you
will
give
Tom
toward
housekeeping
;
because
you
are
always
so
generous
,
 
you
give
such
nice
things
,
you
know
;
and
if
you
set
the
example
,
aunt
Glegg
will
follow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
she
never
can
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
with
unusual
vigor
,
"
for
she
has
n't
got
the
linen
to
follow
suit
wi
'
mine
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
She
'd
niver
the
taste
,
not
if
she
'd
spend
the
money
.
<EOS>
Big
checks
and
live
things
,
like
stags
and
foxes
,
all
her
table
-
linen
is
,
 
not
a
spot
nor
a
diamond
among
'em
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
poor
work
dividing
one
's
linen
before
one
dies
,
 
<EOS>
I
niver
thought
to
ha
'
done
that
,
Bessy
,
"
Mrs.
Pullet
continued
,
shaking
her
head
and
looking
at
her
sister
Tulliver
,
"
when
you
and
me
chose
the
double
diamont
,
<EOS>
the
first
flax
iver
<EOS>
we
'd
spun
,
and
the
Lord
knows
where
yours
is
gone
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
no
choice
,
I
'm
sure
,
sister
,
"
said
poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
accustomed
to
consider
herself
in
the
light
of
an
accused
person
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
it
was
no
wish
o
'
mine
,
<EOS>
iver
,
as
I
should
lie
awake
o
'
nights
thinking
o
'
my
best
bleached
linen
all
over
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Take
a
peppermint
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
"
said
uncle
Pullet
,
feeling
that
he
was
offering
a
cheap
and
wholesome
form
of
comfort
,
which
he
was
recommending
by
example
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
,
aunt
Pullet
,
"
said
Lucy
,
"
you
've
so
much
beautiful
linen
.
<EOS>
And
suppose
you
had
had
daughters
!
<EOS>
Then
you
must
have
divided
it
when
they
were
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
do
n't
say
as
I
wo
n't
do
it
,
"
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
"
for
now
<EOS>
Tom
's
so
lucky
,
it
's
nothing
<EOS>
but
right
his
friends
should
look
on
him
and
help
him
.
<EOS>
There
's
the
tablecloths
I
bought
at
your
sale
,
Bessy
;
it
was
nothing
but
good
natur
<EOS>
"
o

me
to
buy
'em
,
for
they
've
been
lying
in

chest
ever

<EOS>
But
I
'm
not
going

give
Maggie
any
more
<EOS>
o

my
Indy
muslin
and
things
<EOS>
,
if
she
's
to
go
into
service
again

when
she
might
stay
and
keep
me
company
,
and
do
my
sewing
for
me
,
if
she
was
n't
wanted
at
her
brother
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Going
into
service
"
was
the
expression
by
which
the
Dodson
mind
represented
to
itself
the
position
of
teacher
or
governess
;
and
Maggie
's
return
to
that
menial
condition
,
now
circumstances
offered
her
more
eligible
prospects
,
was
likely
to
be
a
sore
point
with
all
her
relatives
,
besides
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Maggie
in
her
crude
form
,
with
her
hair
down
her
back
,
and
altogether
in
a
state
of
dubious
promise
,
was
a
most
undesirable
niece
;
but
now
she
was
capable
of
being
at
once
ornamental
and
useful
.
<EOS>
The
subject
was
revived
in
aunt
and
uncle
Glegg
's
presence
,
over
the
tea
and
muffins
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hegh
,
hegh
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
good
-
naturedly
patting
Maggie
on
the
back
,
"
nonsense
,
nonsense

<EOS>
Do
n't
let
us
hear
of
you
taking
a
place
again
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
Why
,
you
must
ha
'
picked
up
half
-
a
-
dozen
sweethearts
at
the
bazaar
;
is
n't
there
one
of
'em
the
right
sort
of
article
?
<EOS>
Come
,
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Glegg
,
"
said
his
wife
,
with
that
shade
of
increased
politeness
in
her
severity
which
she
always
put
on
with
her
crisper
fronts
,
"
you
'll
excuse
me
,
but
you
're
far
too
light
for
a
man
of
your
years

<EOS>
It
's
respect
and
duty
to
her
aunts
,
and
the
rest
of
her
kin
as
are
so
good
to
her
<EOS>
,
should
have
kept
my
niece
from
fixing
about

not
sweethearts

such

<EOS>
"
Why

what
did

call

when

went

see
'em

They

us
sweet

said
Mr.
Glegg
,
winking
pleasantly
;
while
Mr.
Pullet
,
at
the
suggestion
of
sweetness
,
took
a
little
more
sugar
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Glegg

said
Mrs.

"

"

said
Mrs.

"

There

poor

<EOS>
"
I

Mrs.

bold

<EOS>
Though
it

other

putting

Sister

Mrs.

in
anxiously

I

Not

death
when
you
took
me
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
there
is
Tom
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Lucy
,
clapping
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
come
on
Sindbad
,
as
I
told
him
.
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
he
was
not
going
to
keep
his
promise
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
jumped
up
to
kiss
Tom
as
he
entered
,
with
strong
feeling
,
at
this
first
meeting
since
the
prospect
of
returning
to
the
Mill
had
been
opened
to
him
;
and
she
kept
his
hand
,
leading
him
to
the
chair
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
To
have
no
cloud
between
herself
and
Tom
was
still
a
perpetual
yearning
in
her
,
that
had
its
root
deeper
than
all
change
.
<EOS>
He
smiled
at
her
very
kindly
this
evening
,
and
said
,
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Magsie
,
how
's
aunt
Moss
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
come
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr.
Glegg
putting
out
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
're
such
a
big
man
,
you
carry
all
before
you
,
it
,
seems
.
<EOS>
You
're
come
into
your
luck
a
good
deal
earlier
than
us
old
folks
did
;
but
I
wish
you
joy
,
I
wish
you
joy
.
<EOS>
You
'll
get
the
Mill
all
for
your
own
again
some
day
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
stop
half
-
way
up
the
hill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
hope
he
'll
bear
in
mind
as
it
's
his
mother
's
family
as
he
owes
it
to
,
"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
had
n't
had
them
to
take
after
,
he
'd
ha
'
been
poorly
off
.
<EOS>
There
was
never
any
failures
,
nor
lawing
,
nor
wastefulness
in
our
family
,
nor
dying
without
wills
   
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
nor
sudden
deaths
,
"
said
aunt
Pullet
;
"
allays
the
doctor
called
in
.
<EOS>
But
Tom
had
the
Dodson
skin
;
I
said
that
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
know
what
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
you
_
mean
to
do
,
sister
Glegg
,
<EOS>
but
I
mean
to
give
him
a
tablecloth
of
all
my
three
biggest
sizes
but
one
,
besides
sheets
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
what
more
I
shall
do
;
but
_
<EOS>
that
_
I
shall
do
,
and
if
I
should
die
to
-
morrow
,
Mr.
Pullet
,
you
'll
bear
it
in
mind
,
 
though
you
'll
be
blundering
with
the
keys
,
and
never
remember
as
that
on
the
third
shelf
o
'
the
left
-
hand
wardrobe
,
behind
the
night
-
caps
with
the
broad
ties
,
 
not
the
narrow
-
frilled
uns
,
 
is
the
key
of
the
drawer
in
the
Blue
Room
,
where
the
key
o
'
the
Blue
Closet
is
.
<EOS>
You
'll
make
a
mistake
,
and
I
shall
niver
be
worthy
to
know
it
.
<EOS>
You
've
a
memory
for
my
pills
and
draughts
,
wonderful
,
 
<EOS>
I
'll
allays
say
that
of
you
,
 
<EOS>
but
you
're
lost
among
the
keys
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
gloomy
prospect
of
the
confusion
that
would
ensue
on
her
decease
was
very
affecting
to
Mrs.
Pullet
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
carry
it
too
far
,
Sophy
,
 
<EOS>
that
locking
in
and
out
,
"
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
in
a
tone
of
some
disgust
at
this
folly
.
<EOS>
"
You
go
beyond
your
own
family
.
<EOS>
There
's
<EOS>
nobody
can
say
I
do
n't
lock
up
;
but
I
do
what
's
reasonable
,
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
the
linen
,
I
shall
look
out
what
's
serviceable
,
to
make
a
present
of
to
my
nephey
;
I
've
got
cloth
as
has
never
been
whitened
,
better
worth
having
than
other
people
's
fine
holland
;
and
I
hope
he
'll
lie
down
in
it
and
think
of
his
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
thanked
Mrs.
Glegg
,
but
evaded
any
promise
to
meditate
nightly
on
her
virtues
;
and
Mrs.
Glegg
effected
a
diversion
for
him
by
asking
about
Mr.
Deane
's
intentions
concerning
steam
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
had
had
her
far
-
sighted
views
in
begging
Tom
to
come
on
Sindbad
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
,
when
it
was
time
to
go
home
,
that
the
man
-
servant
was
to
ride
the
horse
,
and
cousin
Tom
was
to
drive
home
his
mother
and
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
sit
by
yourself
,
aunty
,
"
said
that
contriving
young
lady
,
"
because
I
must
sit
by
Tom
;
I
've
a
great
deal
to
say
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
eagerness
of
her
affectionate
anxiety
for
Maggie
,
Lucy
could
not
persuade
herself
to
defer
a
conversation
about
her
with
Tom
,
who
,
she
thought
,
with
such
a
cup
of
joy
before
him
as
this
rapid
fulfilment
of
his
wish
about
the
Mill
,
must
become
pliant
and
flexible
.
<EOS>
Her
nature
supplied
her
with
no
key
to
Tom
's
;
and
she
was
puzzled
as
well
as
pained
to
notice
the
unpleasant
change
on
his
countenance
when
she
gave
him
the
history
of
the
way
in
which
Philip
had
used
his
influence
with
his
father
.
<EOS>
She
had
counted
on
this
revelation
as
a
great
stroke
of
policy
,
which
was
to
turn
Tom
's
heart
toward
Philip
at
once
,
and
,
besides
that
,
prove
that
the
elder
Wakem
was
ready
to
receive
Maggie
with
all
the
honors
of
a
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
wanted
,
then
,
but
for
dear
Tom
,
who
always
had
that
pleasant
smile
when
he
looked
at
cousin
Lucy
,
to
turn
completely
round
,
say
the
opposite
of
what
he
had
always
said
before
,
and
declare
that
he
,
for
his
part
,
was
delighted
that
all
the
old
grievances
should
be
healed
,
and
that
Maggie
should
have
Philip
with
all
suitable
despatch
;
in
cousin
Lucy
's
opinion
nothing
could
be
easier
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
minds
strongly
marked
by
the
positive
and
negative
qualities
that
create
severity
,
 
strength
of
will
,
conscious
rectitude
of
purpose
,
narrowness
of
imagination
and
intellect
,
great
power
of
self
-
control
,
and
a
disposition
to
exert
control
over
others
,
 
prejudices
come
as
the
natural
food
of
tendencies
which
can
get
no
sustenance
out
of
that
complex
,
fragmentary
,
doubt
-
provoking
knowledge
which
we
call
truth
.
<EOS>
Let
a
prejudice
be
bequeathed
,
carried
in
the
air
,
adopted
by
hearsay
,
caught
in
through
the
eye
,
 
<EOS>
however
it
may
come
,
these
minds
will
give
it
a
habitation
;
it
is
something
to
assert
strongly
and
bravely
,
something
to
fill
up
the
void
of
spontaneous
ideas
,
something
to
impose
on
others
with
the
authority
of
conscious
right
;
it
is
at
once
a
staff
and
a
baton
.
<EOS>
Every
prejudice
that
will
answer
these
purposes
is
self
-
evident
.
<EOS>
Our
good
,
upright
Tom
Tulliver
's
mind
was
of
this
class
;
his
inward
criticism
of
his
father
's
faults
did
not
prevent
him
from
adopting
his
father
's
prejudice
;
it
was
a
prejudice
against
a
man
of
lax
principle
and
lax
life
,
and
it
was
a
meeting
-
point
for
all
the
disappointed
feelings
of
family
and
personal
pride
.
<EOS>
Other
feelings
added
their
force
to
produce
Tom
's
bitter
repugnance
to
Philip
,
and
to
Maggie
's
union
with
him
;
and
notwithstanding
Lucy
's
power
over
her
strong
-
willed
cousin
,
she
got
nothing
but
a
cold
refusal
ever
to
sanction
such
a
marriage
;
"
but
of
course
Maggie
could
do
as
she
liked
,
 
she
had
declared
her
determination
to
be
independent
.
<EOS>
For
Tom
's
part
,
he
held
himself
bound
by
his
duty
to
his
father
's
memory
,
and
by
every
manly
feeling
,
never
to
consent
to
any
relation
with
the
Wakems
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thus
,
all
that
Lucy
had
effected
by
her
zealous
mediation
was
to
fill
Tom
's
mind
with
the
expectation
that
Maggie
's
perverse
resolve
to
go
into
a
situation
again
would
presently
metamorphose
itself
,
as
her
resolves
were
apt
to
do
,
into
something
equally
perverse
,
but
entirely
different
,
 
a
marriage
with
Philip
Wakem
.
    
<EOS>
Borne
Along
by
the
Tide
  
<EOS>
In
less
than
a
week
Maggie
was
at
St.
Ogg
's
again
,
 
outwardly
in
much
the
same
position
as
when
her
visit
there
had
just
begun
.
<EOS>
It
was
easy
for
her
to
fill
her
mornings
apart
from
Lucy
without
any
obvious
effort
;
for
she
had
her
promised
visits
to
pay
to
her
aunt
Glegg
,
and
it
was
natural
that
she
should
give
her
mother
more
than
usual
of
her
companionship
in
these
last
weeks
,
especially
as
there
were
preparations
to
be
thought
of
for
Tom
's
housekeeping
.
<EOS>
But
Lucy
would
hear
of
no
pretext
for
her
remaining
away
in
the
evenings
;
she
must
always
come
from
aunt
Glegg
's
before
dinner
,
 
"
else
what
shall
I
have
of
you
?
"
said
Lucy
,
with
a
tearful
pout
that
could
not
be
resisted
.
  
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
had
unaccountably
taken
to
dining
at
Mr.
Deane
's
as
often
as
possible
,
instead
of
avoiding
that
,
as
he
used
to
do
.
<EOS>
At
first
he
began
his
mornings
with
a
resolution
that
he
would
not
dine
there
,
not
even
go
in
the
evening
,
till
Maggie
was
away
.
<EOS>
He
had
even
devised
a
plan
of
starting
off
on
a
journey
in
this
agreeable
June
weather
;
the
headaches
which
he
had
constantly
been
alleging
as
a
ground
for
stupidity
and
silence
were
a
sufficient
ostensible
motive
.
<EOS>
But
the
journey
was
not
taken
,
and
by
the
fourth
morning
no
distinct
resolution
was
formed
about
the
evenings
;
they
were
only
foreseen
as
times
when
Maggie
would
still
be
present
for
a
little
while
,
 
when
one
more
touch
,
one
more
glance
,
might
be
snatched
.
<EOS>
For
why
not
?
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
to
conceal
between
them
<EOS>
;
they
knew
,
they
had
confessed
their
love
,
and
they
had
renounced
each
other
;
they
were
going
to
part
.
<EOS>
Honor
and
conscience
were
going
to
divide
them
;
Maggie
,
with
that
appeal
from
her
inmost
soul
,
had
decided
it
;
but
surely
they
might
cast
a
lingering
look
at
each
other
across
the
gulf
,
before
they
turned
away
never
to
look
again
till
that
strange
light
had
forever
faded
out
of
their
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
,
all
this
time
,
moved
about
with
a
quiescence
and
even
torpor
of
manner
,
so
contrasted
with
her
usual
fitful
brightness
and
ardor
,
that
Lucy
would
have
had
to
seek
some
other
cause
for
such
a
change
,
if
she
had
not
been
convinced
that
the
position
in
which
Maggie
stood
between
Philip
and
her
brother
,
and
the
prospect
of
her
self
-
imposed
wearisome
banishment
,
were
quite
enough
to
account
for
a
large
amount
of
depression
.
<EOS>
But
under
this
torpor
there
was
a
fierce
battle
of
emotions
,
such
as
Maggie
in
all
her
life
of
struggle
had
never
known
or
foreboded
;
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
all
the
worst
evil
in
her
had
lain
in
ambush
till
now
,
and
had
suddenly
started
up
full
-
armed
,
with
hideous
,
overpowering
strength
!
<EOS>
There
were
moments
in
which
a
cruel
selfishness
seemed
to
be
getting
possession
of
her
;
why
should
not
Lucy
,
why
should
not
Philip
,
suffer
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
had
had
to
suffer
through
many
years
of
her
life
;
and
who
had
renounced
anything
for
her
?
<EOS>
And
when
something
like
that
fulness
of
existence
 
love
,
wealth
,
ease
,
refinement
,
all
that
her
nature
craved
 
was
brought
within
her
reach
,
why
was
she
to
forego
it
,
that
another
might
have
it
,
 
another
,
who
perhaps
needed
it
less
?
<EOS>
But
amidst
all
this
new
passionate
tumult
there
were
the
old
voices
making
themselves
heard
with
rising
power
,
till
,
from
time
to
time
,
the
tumult
seemed
quelled
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Was
_
<EOS>
that
existence
which
tempted
her
the
full
existence
she
dreamed
?
<EOS>
Where
,
then
,
would
be
all
the
memories
of
early
striving
;
all
the
deep
pity
for
another
's
pain
,
which
had
been
nurtured
in
her
through
years
of
affection
and
hardship
;
all
the
divine
presentiment
of
something
higher
than
mere
personal
enjoyment
,
which
had
made
the
sacredness
of
life
?
<EOS>
She
might
as
well
hope
to
enjoy
walking
by
maiming
her
feet
,
as
hope
to
enjoy
an
existence
in
which
she
set
out
by
maiming
the
faith
and
sympathy
that
were
the
best
organs
of
her
soul
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
if
pain
were
so
hard
to
_
her
_
<EOS>
,
what
was
it
to
others
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
God
!
<EOS>
preserve
me
from
inflicting
 
give
me
strength
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
"
How
had
she
sunk
into
this
struggle
with
a
temptation
that
she
would
once
have
thought
herself
as
secure
from
as
from
deliberate
crime
?
<EOS>
When
was
that
first
hateful
moment
in
which
she
had
been
conscious
of
a
feeling
that
clashed
with
her
truth
,
affection
,
and
gratitude
,
and
had
not
shaken
it
from
her
with
horror
,
as
if
it
had
been
a
loathsome
thing
?
<EOS>
And
yet
,
since
this
strange
,
sweet
,
subduing
influence
did
not
,
should
not
,
conquer
her
,
 
since
it
was
to
remain
simply
her
own
suffering
,
 
her
mind
was
meeting
Stephen
's
in
that
thought
of
his
,
that
they
might
still
snatch
moments
of
mute
confession
before
the
parting
came
.
<EOS>
For
was
not
he
suffering
too
?
<EOS>
She
saw
it
daily
 
<EOS>
saw
it
in
the
sickened
look
of
fatigue
with
which
,
as
soon
as
he
was
not
compelled
to
exert
himself
,
he
relapsed
into
indifference
toward
everything
<EOS>
but
the
possibility
of
watching
her
.
<EOS>
Could
she
refuse
sometimes
to
answer
that
beseeching
look
which
she
felt
to
be
following
her
like
a
low
murmur
of
love
and
pain
?
<EOS>
She
refused
it
less
and
less
,
till
at
last
the
evening
for
them
both
was
sometimes
made
of
a
moment
's
mutual
gaze
;
they
thought
of
it
till
it
came
,
and
when
it
had
come
,
they
thought
of
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
One
other
thing
Stephen
seemed
now
and
then
to
care
for
,
and
that
was
to
sing
<EOS>
;
it
was
a
way
of
speaking
to
Maggie
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
was
not
distinctly
conscious
that
he
was
impelled
to
it
by
a
secret
longing
 
running
counter
to
all
his

on

<EOS>
Watch
your
own
speech
,
and
notice
how
it
is
guided
by
your
less
conscious
purposes
,
and
you
will
understand
that
contradiction
in
Stephen
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
Wakem
was
a
less
frequent
visitor
,
but
he
came
occasionally
in
the
evening
,
and
it
happened
that
he
was
there
when
Lucy
said
,
as
they
sat
out
on
the
lawn
,
near
sunset
<EOS>
,
    
"
Now
Maggie
's
tale
of
visits
to
aunt
Glegg
is
completed
,
I
mean
that
we
shall
go
out
boating
every
day
until
she
goes
.
<EOS>
She
has
not
had
half
enough
boating
because
of
these
tiresome
visits
,
and
she
likes
it
better
than
anything
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
,
Maggie
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Better
than
any
sort
of
locomotion
,
I
hope
you
mean
,
"
said
Philip
,
smiling
at
Maggie
,
who
was
lolling
backward
in
a
low
garden
-
chair
;
"
else
she
will
be
selling
her
soul
to
that
ghostly
boatman
who
haunts
the
Floss
,
only
for
the
sake
of
being
drifted
in
a
boat
forever
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Should
you
like
to
be
her
boatman
?
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Because
,
if
you
would
,
you
can
come
with
us
and
take
an
oar
.
<EOS>
If
the
Floss
were
but
a
quiet
lake
instead
of
a
river
,
we
should
be
independent
of
any
gentleman
,
for
Maggie
can
row
splendidly
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
we
are
reduced
to
ask
services
of
knights
and
squires
,
who
do
not
seem
to
offer
them
with
great
alacrity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
playful
reproach
at
Stephen
,
who
was
sauntering
up
and
down
,
and
was
just
singing
in
pianissimo
falsetto
,
      
"
<EOS>
The
thirst
that
from
the
soul
doth
rise
  
Doth
ask
a
drink
divine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
no
notice
,
but
still
kept
aloof
;
he
had
done
so
frequently
during
Philip
's
recent
visits
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
seem
inclined
for
boating
,
"
said
Lucy
,
when
he
came
to
sit
down
by
her
on
the
bench
.
<EOS>
"
Does
n't
rowing
suit
you
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
hate
a
large
party
in
a
boat
,
"
he
said
,
almost
irritably
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
come
when
you
have
no
one
else
.
"
  
Lucy
colored
,
fearing
that
Philip
would
be
hurt
;
it
was
quite
a
new
thing
for
Stephen
to
speak
in
that
way
;
but
he
had
certainly
not
been
well
of
late
.
<EOS>
Philip
colored
too
,
but
less
from
a
feeling
of
personal
offence
than
from
a
vague
suspicion
that
Stephen
's
moodiness
had
some
relation
to
Maggie
,
who
had
started
up
from
her
chair
as
he
spoke
,
and
had
walked
toward
the
hedge
of
laurels
to
look
at
the
descending
sunlight
on
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
Miss
Deane
did
n't
know
she
was
excluding
others
by
inviting
me
,
"
said
Philip
,
"
I
am
bound
to
resign
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
you
shall
not
,
"
said
Lucy
,
much
vexed
.
<EOS>
"
I
particularly
wish
for
your
company
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
The
tide
will
suit
at
half
-
past
ten
;
it
will
be
a
delicious
time
for
a
couple
of
hours
to
row
to
Luckreth
and
walk
back
,
before
the
sun
gets
too
hot
.
<EOS>
And
how
can
you
object
to
four
people
in
a
boat
?
<EOS>
"
she
added
,
looking
at
Stephen
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
object
to
the
people
,
but
the
number
,
"
said
Stephen
,
who
had
recovered
himself
,
and
was
rather
ashamed
of
his
rudeness
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
voted
for
a
fourth
at
all
,
of
course
it
would
be
you
,
Phil
.
<EOS>
But
we
wo
n't
divide
the
pleasure
of
escorting
the
ladies
;
we
'll
take
it
alternately
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
incident
had
the
effect
of
drawing
Philip
's
attention
with
freshened
solicitude
toward
Stephen
and
Maggie
;
but
when
they
re
-
entered
the
house
,
music
was
proposed
,
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
and
Mr.
Deane
being
occupied
with
cribbage
,
Maggie
sat
apart
near
the
table
where
the
books
and
work
were
placed
,
doing
nothing
,
however
,
but
listening
abstractedly
to
the
music
.
<EOS>
Stephen
presently
turned
to
a
duet
which
he
insisted
that
Lucy
and
Philip
should
sing
;
he
had
often
done
the
same
thing
before
;
but
this
evening
Philip
thought
he
divined
some
double
intention
in
every
word
and
look
of
Stephen
's
,
and
watched
him
keenly
,
angry
with
himself
all
the
while
for
this
clinging
suspicion
.
<EOS>
For
had
not
Maggie
virtually
denied
any
ground
for
his
doubts
on
her
side
?
<EOS>
And
she
was
truth
itself
;
it
was
impossible
not
to
believe
her
word
and
glance
when
they
had
last
spoken
together
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Stephen
might
be
strongly
fascinated
by
her
<EOS>
(
what
was
more
natural
?
)
,
but
Philip
felt
himself
rather
base
for
intruding
on
what
must
be
his
friend
's
painful
secret
.
<EOS>
Still
he
watched
.
<EOS>
Stephen
,
moving
away
from
the
piano
,
sauntered
slowly
toward
the
table
near
which
Maggie
sat
,
and
turned
over
the
newspapers
,
apparently
in
mere
idleness
.
<EOS>
Then
he
seated
himself
with
his
back
to
the
piano
,
dragging
a
newspaper
under
his
elbow
,
and
thrusting
his
hand
through
his
hair
,
as
if
he
had
been
attracted
by
some
bit
of
local
news
in
the
"
Laceham
Courier
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
in
reality
looking
at
Maggie
who
had
not
taken
the
slightest
notice
of
his
approach
.
<EOS>
She
had
always
additional
strength
of
resistance
when
Philip
was
present
,
just
as
we
can
restrain
our
speech
better
in
a
spot
that
we
feel
to
be
hallowed
.
<EOS>
But
at
last
she
heard
the
word
"
dearest
"
uttered
in
the
softest
tone
of
pained
entreaty
,
like
that
of
a
patient
who
asks
for
something
that
ought
to
have
been
given
without
asking
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
heard
that
word
since
the
moments
in
the
lane
at
Basset
,
when
it
had
come
from
Stephen
again
and
again
,
almost
as
involuntarily
as
if
it
had
been
an
inarticulate
cry
.
<EOS>
Philip
could
hear
no
word
,
but
he
had
moved
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
piano
,
and
could
see
Maggie
start
and
blush
,
raise
her
eyes
an
instant
toward
Stephen
's
face
,
but
immediately
look
apprehensively
toward
himself
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
evident
to
her
that
Philip
had
observed
her
;
but
a
pang
of
shame
,
under
the
sense
of
this
concealment
,
made
her
move
from
her
chair
and
walk
to
her
mother
's
side
to
watch
the
game
at
cribbage
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
went
home
soon
after
in
a
state
of
hideous
doubt
mingled
with
wretched
certainty
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
for
him
now
to
resist
the
conviction
that
there
was
some
mutual
consciousness
between
Stephen
and
Maggie
;
and
for
half
the
night
his
irritable
,
susceptible
nerves
were
pressed
upon
almost
to
frenzy
by
that
one
wretched
fact
;
he
could
attempt
no
explanation
that
would
reconcile
it
with
her
words
and
actions
.
<EOS>
When
,
at
last
,
the
need
for
belief
in
Maggie
rose
to
its
habitual
predominance
,
he
was
not
long
in
imagining
the
truth
,
 
she
was
struggling
,
she
was
banishing
herself
;
this
was
the
clue
to
all
he
had
seen
since
his
return
.
<EOS>
But
athwart
that
belief
there
came
other
possibilities
that
would
not
be
driven
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
His
imagination
wrought
out
the
whole
story
;
Stephen
was
madly
in
love
with
her
;
he
must
have
told
her
so
;
she
had
rejected
him
,
and
was
hurrying
away
.
<EOS>
But
would
he
give
her
up
,
knowing
 
Philip
felt
the
fact
with
heart
-
crushing
despair
 
<EOS>
that
she
was
made
half
helpless
by
her
feeling
toward
him
?
  
<EOS>
When
the
morning
came
,
Philip
was
too
ill
to
think
of
keeping
his
engagement
to
go
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
In
his
present
agitation
he
could
decide
on
nothing
;
he
could
only
alternate
between
contradictory
intentions
.
<EOS>
First
,
he
thought
he
must
have
an
interview
with
Maggie
,
and
entreat
her
to
confide
in
him
;
then
,
again
,
he
distrusted
his
own
interference
.
<EOS>
Had
he
not
been
thrusting
himself
on
Maggie
all
along
?
<EOS>
She
had
uttered
words
long
ago
in
her
young
ignorance
;
it
was
enough
to
make
her
hate
him
that
these
should
be
continually
present
with
her
as
a
bond
.
<EOS>
And
had
he
any
right
to
ask
her
for
a
revelation
of
feelings
which
she
had
evidently
intended
to
withhold
from
him
?
<EOS>
He
would
not
trust
himself
to
see
her
,
till
he
had
assured
himself
that
he
could
act
from
pure
anxiety
for
her
,
and
not
from
egoistic
irritation
.
<EOS>
He
wrote
a
brief
note
to
Stephen
,
and
sent
it
early
by
the
servant
,
saying
that
he
was
not
well
enough
to
fulfil
his
engagement
to
Miss
Deane
.
<EOS>
Would
Stephen
take
his
excuse
,
and
fill
his
place
?
  
<EOS>
Lucy
had
arranged
a
charming
plan
,
which
had
made
her
quite
content
with
Stephen
's
refusal
to
go
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
She
discovered
that
her
father
was
to
drive
to
Lindum
this
morning
at
ten
;
Lindum
was
the
very
place
she
wanted
to
go
to
,
to
make
purchases
,
 
important
purchases
,
which
must
by
no
means
be
put
off
to
another
opportunity
;
and
aunt
Tulliver
must
go
too
,
because
she
was
concerned
in
some
of
the
purchases
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
have
your
row
in
the
boat
just
the
same
,
you
know
,
"
she
said
to
Maggie
when
they
went
out
of
the
breakfast
-
room
and
upstairs
together
;
<EOS>
"
Philip
will
be
here
it
half
-
past
ten
,
and
it
is
a
delicious
morning
.
<EOS>
Now
do
n't
say
a
word
against
it
,
you
dear
dolorous
thing
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
use
of
my
being
a
fairy
godmother
,
if
you
set
your
face
against
all
the
wonders
I
work
for
you
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
think
of
awful
cousin
Tom
;
you
may
disobey
him
a
little
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
did
not
persist
in
objecting
.
<EOS>
She
was
almost
glad
of
the
plan
,
for
perhaps
it
would
bring
her
some
strength
and
calmness
to
be
alone
with
Philip
again
;
it
was
like
revisiting
the
scene
of
a
quieter
life
,
in
which
the
very
struggles
were
repose
,
compared
with
the
daily
tumult
of
the
present
.
<EOS>
She
prepared
herself
for
the
boat
and
at
half
-
past
ten
sat
waiting
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
ring
of
the
door
-
bell
was
punctual
,
and
she
was
thinking
with
half
-
sad
,
affectionate
pleasure
of
the
surprise
Philip
would
have
in
finding
that
he
was
to
be
with
her
alone
,
when
she
distinguished
a
firm
,
rapid
step
across
the
hall
,
that
was
certainly
not
Philip
's
;
the
door
opened
,
and
Stephen
Guest
entered
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
first
moment
they
were
both
too
much
agitated
to
speak
;
for
Stephen
had
learned
from
the
servant
that
the
others
were
gone
out
.
<EOS>
Maggie
had
started
up
and
sat
down
again
,
with
her
heart
beating
violently
;
and
Stephen
,
throwing
down
his
cap
and
gloves
,
came
and
sat
by
her
in
silence
.
<EOS>
She
thought
Philip
would
be
coming
soon
;
and
with
great
effort
 
for
she
trembled
visibly
 
<EOS>
she
rose
to
go
to
a
distant
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
coming
,
"
said
Stephen
,
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
we
ca
n't
go
,
"
said
Maggie
,
sinking
into
her
chair
again
.
<EOS>
"
Lucy
did
not
expect
 
she
would
be
hurt
.
<EOS>
Why
is
not
Philip
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
well
;
he
asked
me
to
come
instead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
is
gone
to
Lindum
,
"
said
Maggie
,
taking
off
her
bonnet
with
hurried
,
trembling
fingers
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
not
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
well
,
"
said
Stephen
,
dreamily
,
looking
at
her
,
as
he
rested
his
arm
on
the
back
of
his
chair
.
<EOS>
"
Then
we
'll
stay
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
looking
into
her
deep
,
deep
eyes
,
far
off
and
mysterious
at
the
starlit
blackness
,
and
yet
very
near
,
and
timidly
loving
.
<EOS>
Maggie
sat
perfectly
still
 
perhaps
for
moments
,
perhaps
for
minutes
 
until
the
helpless
trembling
had
ceased
,
and
there
was
a
warm
glow
on
her
check
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
man
is
waiting
;
he
has
taken
the
cushions
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
go
and
tell
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
shall
I
tell
him
?
"
said
Stephen
,
almost
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
He
was
looking
at
the
lips
now
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
made
no
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
,
"
Stephen
murmured
entreatingly
,
rising
,
and
taking
her
hand
to
raise
her
too
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
be
long
together
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
they
went
.
<EOS>
Maggie
felt
that
she
was
being
led
down
the
garden
among
the
roses
,
being
helped
with
firm
,
tender
care
into
the
boat
,
having
the
cushion
and
cloak
arranged
for
her
feet
,
and
her
parasol
opened
for
her
(
which
she
had
forgotten
)
,
all
by
this
stronger
presence
that
seemed
to
bear
her
along
without
any
act
of
her
own
will
,
like
the
added
self
which
comes
with
the
sudden
exalting
influence
of
a
strong
tonic
,
and
she
felt
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
Memory
was
excluded
.
  
<EOS>
They
glided
rapidly
along
,
Stephen
rowing
,
helped
by
the
backward
-
flowing
tide
,
past
the
Tofton
trees
and
houses
;
on
between
the
silent
sunny
fields
and
pastures
,
which
seemed
filled
with
a
natural
joy
that
had
no
reproach
for
theirs
.
<EOS>
The
breath
of
the
young
,
unwearied
day
,
the
delicious
rhythmic
dip
of
the
oars
,
the
fragmentary
song
of
a
passing
bird
heard
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
as
if
it
were
only
the
overflowing
of
brimful
gladness
,
the
sweet
solitude
of
a
twofold
consciousness
that
was
mingled
into
one
by
that
grave
,
untiring
gaze
which
need
not
be
averted
,
 
what
else
could
there
be
in
their
minds
for
the
first
hour
?
<EOS>
Some
low
,
subdued
,
languid
exclamation
of
love
came
from
Stephen
from
time
to
time
,
as
he
went
on
rowing
idly
,
half
automatically
;
otherwise
they
spoke
no
word
;
for
what
could
words
have
been
but
an
inlet
to
thought
?
<EOS>
and
thought
did
not
belong
to
that
enchanted
haze
in
which
they
were
enveloped
,
 
it
belonged
to
the
past
and
the
future
that
lay
outside
the
haze
.
<EOS>
Maggie
was
only
dimly
conscious
of
the
banks
,
as
they
passed
them
,
and
dwelt
with
no
recognition
on
the
villages
;
she
knew
there
were
several
to
be
passed
before
they
reached
Luckreth
,
where
they
always
stopped
and
left
the
boat
.
<EOS>
At
all
times
she
was
so
liable
to
fits
of
absence
,
that
she
was
likely
enough
to
let
her
waymarks
pass
unnoticed
.
  
<EOS>
But
at
last
Stephen
,
who
had
been
rowing
more
and
more
idly
,
ceased
to
row
,
laid
down
the
oars
,
folded
his
arms
,
and
looked
down
on
the
water
as
if
watching
the
pace
at
which
the
boat
glided
without
his
help
.
<EOS>
This
sudden
change
roused
Maggie
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
the
far
-
stretching
fields
,
at
the
banks
close
by
,
and
felt
that
they
were
entirely
strange
to
her
.
<EOS>
A
terrible
alarm
took
possession
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
have
we
passed
Luckreth
,
where
we
were
to
stop
?
<EOS>
"
she
exclaimed
,
looking
back
to
see
if
the
place
were
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
No
village
was
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
She
turned
around
again
,
with
a
look
of
distressed
questioning
at
Stephen
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
on
watching
the
water
,
and
said
,
in
a
strange
,
dreamy
,
absent
tone
,
"
Yes
,
a
long
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
shall
I
do
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Maggie
,
in
an
agony
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
get
home
for
hours
,
and
Lucy
?
<EOS>
O
God
,
help
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
clasped
her
hands
and
broke
into
a
sob
,
like
a
frightened
child
;
she
thought
of
nothing
but
of
meeting
Lucy
,
and
seeing
her
look
of
pained
surprise
and
doubt
,
perhaps
of
just
upbraiding
.
  
<EOS>
Stephen
moved
and
sat
near
her
,
and
gently
drew
down
the
clasped
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
deep
tone
of
slow
decision
,
"
let
us
never
go
home
again
,
till
no
one
can
part
us
,
 
till
we
are
married
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
unusual
tone
,
the
startling
words
,
arrested
Maggie
's
sob
,
and
she
sat
quite
still
,
wondering
;
as
if
Stephen
might
have
seen
some
possibilities
that
would
alter
everything
,
and
annul
the
wretched
facts
.
  
<EOS>
"
See
,
Maggie
,
how
everything
has
come
without
our
seeking
,
 
in
spite
of
all
our
efforts
.
<EOS>
We
never
thought
of
being
alone
together
again
;
it
has
all
been
done
by
others
.
<EOS>
See
how
the
tide
is
carrying
us
out
,
away
from
all
those
unnatural
bonds
that
we
have
been
trying
to
make
faster
round
us
,
and
trying
in
vain
.
<EOS>
It
will
carry
us
on
to
Torby
,
and
we
can
land
there
,
and
get
some
carriage
,
and
hurry
on
to
York
and
then
to
Scotland
,
 
and
never
pause
a
moment
till
we
are
bound
to
each
other
,
so
that
only
death
can
part
us
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
only
right
thing
,
dearest
;
it
is
the
only
way
of
escaping
from
this
wretched
entanglement
.
<EOS>
Everything
has
concurred
to
point
it
out
to
us
.
<EOS>
We
have
contrived
nothing
,
we
have
thought
of
nothing
ourselves
.
"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
spoke
with
deep
,
earnest
pleading
.
<EOS>
Maggie
listened
,
passing
from
her
startled
wonderment
to
the
yearning
after
that
belief
that
the
tide
was
doing
it
all
,
that
she
might
glide
along
with
the
swift
,
silent
stream
,
and
not
struggle
any
more
.
<EOS>
But
across
that
stealing
influence
came
the
terrible
shadow
of
past
thoughts
;
and
the
sudden
horror
lest
now
,
at
last
,
the
moment
of
fatal
intoxication
was
close
upon
her
,
called
up
feelings
of
angry
resistance
toward
Stephen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
in
an
agitated
tone
,
flashing
an
indignant
look
at
him
,
and
trying
to
get
her
hands
free
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
wanted
to
deprive
me
of
any
choice
.
<EOS>
You
knew
we
were
come
too
far
;
you
have
dared
to
take
advantage
of
my
thoughtlessness
.
<EOS>
It
is
unmanly
to
bring
me
into
such
a
position
.
"
  
<EOS>
Stung
by
this
reproach
,
he
released
her
hands
,
moved
back
to
his
former
place
,
and
folded
his
arms
,
in
a
sort
of
desperation
at
the
difficulty
Maggie
's
words
had
made
present
to
him
.
<EOS>
If
she
would
not
consent
to
go
on
,
he
must
curse
himself
for
the
embarrassment
he
had
led
her
into
.
<EOS>
But
the
reproach
was
the
unendurable
thing
;
the
one
thing
worse
than
parting
with
her
was
,
that
she
should
feel
he
had
acted
unworthily
toward
her
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
said
,
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
rage
,
    
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
notice
that
we
had
passed
Luckreth
till
we
had
got
to
the
next
village
;
and
then
it
came
into
my
mind
that
we
would
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
justify
it
;
I
ought
to
have
told
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
enough
to
make
you
hate
me
,
since
you
do
n't
love
me
well
enough
to
make
everything
else
indifferent
to
you
,
as
I
do
you
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
stop
the
boat
and
try
to
get
you
out
here
?
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
Lucy
that
I
was
mad
,
and
that
you
hate
me
;
and
you
shall
be
clear
of
me
forever
.
<EOS>
No
one
can
blame
you
,
because
I
have
behaved
unpardonably
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
was
paralyzed
;
it
was
easier
to
resist
Stephen
's
pleading
than
this
picture
he
had
called
up
of
himself
suffering
while
she
was
vindicated
;
easier
even
to
turn
away
from
his
look
of
tenderness
than
from
this
look
of
angry
misery
,
that
seemed
to
place
her
in
selfish
isolation
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
called
up
a
state
of
feeling
in
which
the
reasons
which
had
acted
on
her
conscience
seemed
to
be
transmitted
into
mere
self
-
regard
.
<EOS>
The
indignant
fire
in
her
eyes
was
quenched
,
and
she
began
to
look
at
him
with
timid
distress
.
<EOS>
She
had
reproached
him
for
being
hurried
into
irrevocable
trespass
,
 
she
,
who
had
been
so
weak
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
if
I
should
n't
feel
what
happened
to
you
 
just
the
same
,
"
she
said
,
with
reproach
of
another
kind
,
 
the
reproach
of
love
,
asking
for
more
trust
.
<EOS>
This
yielding
to
the
idea
of
Stephen
's
suffering
was
more
fatal
than
the
other
yielding
,
because
it
was
less
distinguishable
from
that
sense
of
others
'
claims
which
was
the
moral
basis
of
her
resistance
.
  
<EOS>
He
felt
all
the
relenting
in
her
look
and
tone
;
it
was
heaven
opening
again
.
<EOS>
He
moved
to
her
side
,
and
took
her
hand
,
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
back
of
the
boat
,
and
saying
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
dreaded
to
utter
another
word
,
he
dreaded
to
make
another
movement
,
that
might
provoke
another
reproach
or
denial
from
her
.
<EOS>
Life
hung
on
her
consent
;
everything
else
was
hopeless
,
confused
,
sickening
misery
.
<EOS>
They
glided
along
in
this
way
,
both
resting
in
that
silence
as
in
a
haven
,
both
dreading
lest
their
feelings
should
be
divided
again
,
 
till
they
became
aware
that
the
clouds
had
gathered
,
and
that
the
slightest
perceptible
freshening
of
the
breeze
was
growing
and
growing
,
so
that
the
whole
character
of
the
day
was
altered
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
chill
,
Maggie
,
in
this
thin
dress
.
<EOS>
Let
me
raise
the
cloak
over
your
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Get
up
an
instant
,
dearest
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
obeyed
;
there
was
an
unspeakable
charm
in
being
told
what
to
do
,
and
having
everything
decided
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
sat
down
again
covered
with
the
cloak
,
and
Stephen
took
to
his
oars
again
,
making
haste
;
for
they
must
try
to
get
to
Torby
as
fast
as
they
could
.
<EOS>
Maggie
was
hardly
conscious
of
having
said
or
done
anything
decisive
.
<EOS>
All
yielding
is
attended
with
a
less
vivid
consciousness
than
resistance
;
it
is
the
partial
sleep
of
thought
;
it
is
the
submergence
of
our
own
personality
by
another
.
<EOS>
Every
influence
tended
to
lull
her
into
acquiescence
.
<EOS>
That
dreamy
gliding
in
the
boat
which
had
lasted
for
four
hours
,
and
had
brought
some
weariness
and
exhaustion
;
the
recoil
of
her
fatigued
sensations
from
the
impracticable
difficulty
of
getting
out
of
the
boat
at
this
unknown
distance
from
home
,
and
walking
for
long
miles
,
 
all
helped
to
bring
her
into
more
complete
subjection
to
that
strong
,
mysterious
charm
which
made
a
last
parting
from
Stephen
<EOS>
seem
the
death
of
all
joy
,
and
made
the
thought
of
wounding
him
like
the
first
touch
of
the
torturing
iron
before
which
resolution
shrank
.
<EOS>
And
then
there
was
the
present
happiness
of
being
with
him
,
which
was
enough
to
absorb
all
her
languid
energy
.
  
<EOS>
Presently
Stephen
observed
a
vessel
coming
after
them
.
<EOS>
Several
vessels
,
among
them
the
steamer
to
Mudport
,
had
passed
them
with
the
early
tide
,
but
for
the
last
hour
they
had
seen
none
.
<EOS>
He
looked
more
and
more
eagerly
at
this
vessel
,
as
if
a
new
thought
had
come
into
his
mind
along
with
it
,
and
then
he
looked
at
Maggie
hesitatingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
dearest
,
"
he
said
at
last
,
"
if
this
vessel
should
be
going
to
Mudport
,
or
to
any
convenient
place
on
the
coast
northward
,
it
would
be
our
best
plan
to
get
them
to
take
us
on
board
.
<EOS>
You
are
fatigued
,
and
it
may
soon
rain
;
it
may
be
a
wretched
business
,
getting
to
Torby
in
this
boat
.
<EOS>
It
's
only
a
trading
vessel
,
but
I
dare
say
you
can
be
made
tolerably
comfortable
.
<EOS>
We
'll
take
the
cushions
out
of
the
boat
.
<EOS>
It
is
really
our
best
plan
.
<EOS>
They
'll
be
glad
enough
to
take
us
.
<EOS>
I
've
got
plenty
of
money
about
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
pay
them
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
heart
began
to
beat
with
reawakened
alarm
at
this
new
proposition
;
but
she
was
silent
,
 
one
course
seemed
as
difficult
as
another
.
  
<EOS>
Stephen
hailed
the
vessel
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
Dutch
vessel
going
to
Mudport
,
the
English
mate
informed
him
,
and
,
if
this
wind
held
,
would
be
there
in
less
than
two
days
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
had
got
out
too
far
with
our
boat
,
"
said
Stephen
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
trying
to
make
for
Torby
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
afraid
of
the
weather
;
and
this
lady
 
<EOS>
my
wife
 
will
be
exhausted
with
fatigue
and
hunger
.
<EOS>
Take
us
on
board
 
will
you
?
 
and
haul
up
the
boat
.
<EOS>
I
'll
pay
you
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
,
now
really
faint
and
trembling
with
fear
,
was
taken
on
board
,
making
an
interesting
object
of
contemplation
to
admiring
Dutchmen
.
<EOS>
The
mate
feared
the
lady
would
have
a
poor
time
of
it
on
board
,
for
they
had
no
accommodation
for
such
entirely
unlooked
-
for
passengers
,
 
no
private
cabin
larger
than
an
old
-
fashioned
church
-
pew
.
<EOS>
But
at
least
they
had
Dutch
cleanliness
,
which
makes
all
other
inconveniences
tolerable
;
and
the
boat
cushions
were
spread
into
a
couch
for
Maggie
on
the
poop
with
all
alacrity
.
<EOS>
But
to
pace
up
and
down
the
deck
leaning
on
Stephen
 
being
upheld
by
his
strength
 
was
the
first
change
that
she
needed
;
then
came
food
,
and
then
quiet
reclining
on
the
cushions
,
with
the
sense
that
no
new
resolution
_
could
_
be
taken
that
day
.
<EOS>
Everything
must
wait
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Stephen
sat
beside
her
with
her
hand
in
his
;
they
could
only
speak
to
each
other
in
low
tones
;
only
look
at
each
other
now
and
then
,
for
it
would
take
a
long
while
to
dull
the
curiosity
of
the
five
men
on
board
,
and
reduce
these
handsome
young
strangers
to
that
minor
degree
of
interest
which
belongs
,
in
a
sailor
's
regard
,
to
all
objects
nearer
than
the
horizon
.
<EOS>
But
Stephen
was
triumphantly
happy
.
<EOS>
Every
other
thought
or
care
was
thrown
into
unmarked
perspective
by
the
certainty
that
Maggie
must
be
his
.
<EOS>
The
leap
had
been
taken
now
;
he
had
been
tortured
by
scruples
,
he
had
fought
fiercely
with
overmastering
inclination
,
he
had
hesitated
;
but
repentance
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
He
murmured
forth
in
fragmentary
sentences
his
happiness
,
his
adoration
,
his
tenderness
,
his
belief
that
their
life
together
must
be
heaven
,
that
her
presence
with
him
would
give
rapture
to
every
common
day
;
that
to
satisfy
her
lightest
wish
was
dearer
to
him
than
all
other
bliss
;
that
everything
was
easy
for
her
sake
,
except
to
part
with
her
;
and
now
they
never
_
<EOS>
would
_
part
;
he
would
belong
to
her
forever
,
and
<EOS>
all
that
was
his
was
hers
<EOS>
,
 
had
no
value
for
him
except
as
it
was
hers
.
<EOS>
Such
things
,
uttered
in
low
,
broken
tones
by
the
one
voice
that
has
first
stirred
the
fibre
of
young
passion
,
have
only
a
feeble
effect
 
on
experienced
minds
at
a
distance
from
them
.
<EOS>
To
poor
Maggie
they
were
very
near
;
they
were
like
nectar
held
close
to
thirsty
lips
;
there
was
,
there
<EOS>
_
must
_
be
,
then
,
a
life
for
mortals
here
below
which
was
not
hard
and
chill
,
 
in
which
affection
would
no
longer
be
self
-
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
Stephen
's
passionate
words
made
the
vision
of
such
a
life
more
fully
present
to
her
than
it
had
ever
been
before
;
and
the
vision
for
the
time
excluded
all
realities
,
 
all
except
the
returning
sun
-
gleams
which
broke
out
on
the
waters
as
the
evening
approached
,
and
mingled
with
the
visionary
sunlight
of
promised
happiness
;
all
except
the
hand
that
pressed
hers
,
and
the
voice
that
spoke
to
her
,
and
the
eyes
that
looked
at
her
with
grave
,
unspeakable
love
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
to
be
no
rain
,
after
all
;
the
clouds
rolled
off
to
the
horizon
again
,
making
the
great
purple
rampart
and
long
purple
isles
of
that
wondrous
land
which
reveals
itself
to
us
when
the
sun
goes
down
,
 
the
land
that
the
evening
star
watches
over
.
<EOS>
Maggie
was
to
sleep
all
night
on
the
poop
;
it
was
better
than
going
below
;
and
she
was
covered
with
the
warmest
wrappings
the
ship
could
furnish
.
<EOS>
It
was
still
early
,
when
the
fatigues
of
the
day
brought
on
a
drowsy
longing
for
perfect
rest
,
and
she
laid
down
her
head
,
looking
at
the
faint
,
dying
flush
in
the
west
,
where
the
one
golden
lamp
was
getting
brighter
and
brighter
.
<EOS>
Then
she
looked
up
at
Stephen
,
who
was
still
seated
by
her
,
hanging
over
her
as
he
leaned
his
arm
against
the
vessel
's
side
.
<EOS>
Behind
all
the
delicious
visions
of
these
last
hours
,
which
had
flowed
over
her
like
a
soft
stream
,
and
made
her
entirely
passive
,
there
was
the
dim
consciousness
that
the
condition
was
a
transient
one
,
and
that
the
morrow
must
bring
back
the
old
life
of
struggle
;
that
there
were
thoughts
which
would
presently
avenge
themselves
for
this
oblivion
.
<EOS>
But
now
nothing
was
distinct
to
her
;
she
was
being
lulled
to
sleep
with
that
soft
stream
still
flowing
over
her
,
with
those
delicious
visions
melting
and
fading
like
the
wondrous
aerial
land
of
the
west
.
    
<EOS>
Waking
  
<EOS>
When
Maggie
was
gone
to
sleep
,
Stephen
,
weary
too
with
his
unaccustomed
amount
of
rowing
,
and
with
the
intense
inward
life
of
the
last
twelve
hours
,
but
too
restless
to
sleep
,
walked
and
lounged
about
the
deck
with
his
cigar
far
on
into
midnight
,
not
seeing
the
dark
water
,
hardly
conscious
there
were
stars
,
living
only
in
the
near
and
distant
future
.
<EOS>
At
last
fatigue
conquered
restlessness
,
and
he
rolled
himself
up
in
a
piece
of
tarpaulin
on
the
deck
near
Maggie
's
feet
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
fallen
asleep
before
nine
,
and
had
been
sleeping
for
six
hours
before
the
faintest
hint
of
a
midsummer
daybreak
was
discernible
.
<EOS>
She
awoke
from
that
vivid
dreaming
which
makes
the
margin
of
our
deeper
rest
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
a
boat
on
the
wide
water
with
Stephen
,
and
in
the
gathering
darkness
something
like
a
star
appeared
,
that
grew
and
grew
till
they
saw
it
was
the
Virgin
seated
in
St.
Ogg
's
boat
,
and
it
came
nearer
and
nearer
,
till
they
saw
the
Virgin
was
Lucy
and
the
boatman
<EOS>
was
Philip
,
 
no
,
not
Philip
,
but
her
brother
,
who
rowed
past
without
looking
at
her
;
and
she
rose
to
stretch
out
her
arms
and
call
to
him
,
and
their
own
boat
turned
over
with
the
movement
,
and
they
began
to
sink
,
till
with
one
spasm
of
dread
she
seemed
to
awake
,
and
find
she
was
a
child
again
in
the
parlor
at
evening
twilight
,
and
Tom
was
not
really
angry
.
<EOS>
From
the
soothed
sense
of
that
false
waking
she
passed
to
the
real
waking
,
 
to
the
plash
of
water
against
the
vessel
,
and
the
sound
of
a
footstep
on
the
deck
,
and
the
awful
starlit
sky
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
moment
of
utter
bewilderment
before
her
mind
could
get
disentangled
from
the
confused
web
of
dreams
;
but
soon
the
whole
terrible
truth
urged
itself
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Stephen
was
not
by
her
now
;
she
was
alone
with
her
own
memory
and
her
own
dread
.
<EOS>
The
irrevocable
wrong
that
must
blot
her
life
had
been
committed
;
she
had
brought
sorrow
into
the
lives
of
others
,
 
into
the
lives
that
were
knit
up
with
hers
by
trust
and
love
.
<EOS>
The
feeling
of
a
few
short
weeks
had
hurried
her
into
the
sins
her
nature
had
most
recoiled
from
,
 
breach
of
faith
and
cruel
selfishness
;
she
had
rent
the
ties
that
had
given
meaning
to
duty
,
and
had
made
herself
an
outlawed
soul
,
with
no
guide
but
the
wayward
choice
of
her
own
passion
.
<EOS>
And
where
would
that
lead
her
?
<EOS>
Where
had
it
led
her
now
?
<EOS>
She
had
said
she
would
rather
die
than
fall
into
that
temptation
.
<EOS>
She
felt
it
now
,
 
now
that
the
consequences
of
such
a
fall
had
come
before
the
outward
act
was
completed
.
<EOS>
There
was
at
least
this
fruit
from
all
her
years
of
striving
after
the
highest
and
best
,
 
that
her
soul
though
betrayed
,
beguiled
,
ensnared
,
could
never
deliberately
consent
to
a
choice
of
the
lower
.
<EOS>
And
a
choice
of
what
?
<EOS>
O
God
!
<EOS>
not
a
choice
of
joy
,
but
of
conscious
cruelty
and
hardness
;
for
could
she
ever
cease
to
see
before
her
Lucy
and
Philip
,
with
their
murdered
trust
and
hopes
?
<EOS>
Her
life
with
Stephen
could
have
no
sacredness
;
she
must
forever
sink
and
wander
vaguely
,
driven
by
uncertain
impulse
;
for
she
had
let
go
the
clue
of
life
,
 
that
clue
which
once
in
the
far
-
off
years
her
young
need
had
clutched
so
strongly
.
<EOS>
She
had
renounced
all
delights
then
,
before
she
knew
them
,
before
they
had
come
within
her
reach
.
<EOS>
Philip
had
been
right
when
he
told
her
that
she
knew
nothing
of
renunciation
;
she
had
thought
it
was
quiet
ecstasy
;
she
saw
it
face
to
face
now
,
 
that
sad
,
patient
,
loving
strength
which
holds
the
clue
of
life
,
 
and
saw
that
the
thorns
were
forever
pressing
on
its
brow
.
<EOS>
The
yesterday
,
which
could
never
be
revoked
,
 
if
she
could
have
changed
it
now
for
any
length
of
inward
silent
endurance
,
she
would
have
bowed
beneath
that
cross
with
a
sense
of
rest
.
  
<EOS>
Day
break
came
and
the
reddening
eastern
light
,
while
her
past
life
was
grasping
her
in
this
way
,
with
that
tightening
clutch
which
comes
in
the
last
moments
of
possible
rescue
.
<EOS>
She
could
see
Stephen
now
lying
on
the
deck
still
fast
asleep
,
and
with
the
sight
of
him
there
came
a
wave
of
anguish
that
found
its
way
in
a
long
-
suppressed
sob
.
<EOS>
The
worst
bitterness
of
parting
 
<EOS>
the
thought
that
urged
the
sharpest
inward
cry
for
help
 
was
the
pain
it
must
give
to
_
him
_
.
<EOS>
But
surmounting
everything
was
the
horror
at
her
own
possible
failure
,
the
dread
lest
her
conscience
should
be
benumbed
again
,
and
not
rise
to
energy
till
it
was
too
late
.
<EOS>
Too
late
!
<EOS>
it
was
too
late
already
not
to
have
caused
misery
;
too
late
for
everything
,
perhaps
,
but
to
rush
away
from
the
last
act
of
baseness
,
 
the
tasting
of
joys
that
were
wrung
from
crushed
hearts
.
  
<EOS>
The
sun
was
rising
now
,
and
Maggie
started
up
with
the
sense
that
a
day
of
resistance
was
beginning
for
her
.
<EOS>
Her
eyelashes
were
still
wet
with
tears
,
as
,
with
her
shawl
over
her
head
,
she
sat
looking
at
the
slowly
rounding
sun
.
<EOS>
Something
roused
Stephen
too
,
and
getting
up
from
his
hard
bed
,
he
came
to
sit
beside
her
.
<EOS>
The
sharp
instinct
of
anxious
love
saw
something
to
give
him
alarm
in
the
very
first
glance
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
hovering
dread
of
some
resistance
in
Maggie
's
nature
that
he
would
be
unable
to
overcome
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
uneasy
consciousness
that
he
had
robbed
her
of
perfect
freedom
yesterday
;
there
was
too
much
native
honor
in
him
,
for
him
not
to
feel
that
,
if
her
will
should
recoil
,
his
conduct
would
have
been
odious
,
and
she
would
have
a
right
to
reproach
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
Maggie
did
not
feel
that
right
;
she
was
too
conscious
of
fatal
weakness
in
herself
,
too
full
of
the
tenderness
that
comes
with
the
foreseen
need
for
inflicting
a
wound
.
<EOS>
She
let
him
take
her
hand
when
he
came
to
sit
down
beside
her
,
and
smiled
at
him
,
only
with
rather
a
sad
glance
;
she
could
say
nothing
to
pain
him
till
the
moment
of
possible
parting
was
nearer
.
<EOS>
And
so
they
drank
their
cup
of
coffee
together
,
and
walked
about
the
deck
,
and
heard
the
captain
's
assurance
that
they
should
be
in
at
Mudport
by
five
o'clock
,
each
with
an
inward
burthen
;
but
in
him
it
was
an
undefined
fear
,
which
he
trusted
to
the
coming
hours
to
dissipate
;
in
her
it
was
a
definite
resolve
on
which
she
was
trying
silently
to
tighten
her
hold
.
<EOS>
Stephen
was
continually
,
through
the
morning
,
expressing
his
anxiety
at
the
fatigue
and
discomfort
she
was
suffering
,
and
alluded
to
landing
and
to
the
change
of
motion
and
repose
she
would
have
in
a
carriage
,
wanting
to
assure
himself
more
completely
by
presupposing
that
everything
would
be
as
he
had
arranged
it
.
<EOS>
For
a
long
while
Maggie
contented
herself
with
assuring
him
that
she
had
had
a
good
night
's
rest
,
and
that
she
did
n't
mind
about
being
on
the
vessel
,
 
it
was
not
like
being
on
the
open
sea
,
it
was
only
a
little
less
pleasant
than
being
in
a
boat
on
the
Floss
.
<EOS>
But
a
suppressed
resolve
will
betray
itself
in
the
eyes
,
and
Stephen
became
more
and
more
uneasy
as
the
day
advanced
,
under
the
sense
that
Maggie
had
entirely
lost
her
passiveness
.
<EOS>
He
longed
,
but
did
not
dare
,
to
speak
of
their
marriage
,
of
where
they
would
go
after
it
,
and
the
steps
he
would
take
to
inform
his
father
,
and
the
rest
,
of
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
He
longed
to
assure
himself
of
a
tacit
assent
from
her
.
<EOS>
But
each
time
he
looked
at
her
,
he
gathered
a
stronger
dread
of
the
new
,
quiet
sadness
with
which
she
met
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
And
they
were
more
and
more
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
we
are
in
sight
of
Mudport
,
"
he
said
at
last
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
dearest
,
"
he
added
,
turning
toward
her
with
a
look
that
was
half
beseeching
,
"
the
worst
part
of
your
fatigue
is
over
.
<EOS>
On
the
land
we
can
command
swiftness
.
<EOS>
In
another
hour
and
a
half
we
shall
be
in
a
chaise
together
,
and
that
will
seem
rest
to
you
after
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
felt
it
was
time
to
speak
;
it
would
only
be
unkind
now
to
assent
by
silence
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
in
the
lowest
tone
,
as
he
had
done
,
but
with
distinct
decision
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
be
together
;
we
shall
have
parted
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
blood
rushed
to
Stephen
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
die
first
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
as
he
had
dreaded
 
<EOS>
there
was
a
struggle
coming
.
<EOS>
But
neither
of
them
dared
to
say
another
word
till
the
boat
was
let
down
,
and
they
were
taken
to
the
landing
-
place
.
<EOS>
Here
there
was
a
cluster
of
gazers
and
passengers
awaiting
the
departure
of
the
steamboat
to
St.
Ogg
's
.
<EOS>
Maggie
had
a
dim
sense
,
when
she
had
landed
,
and
Stephen
was
hurrying
her
along
on
his
arm
,
that
some
one
had
advanced
toward
her
from
that
cluster
as
if
he
were
coming
to
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
hurried
along
,
and
was
indifferent
to
everything
but
the
coming
trial
.
  
<EOS>
A
porter
guided
them
to
the
nearest
inn
and
posting
-
house
,
and
Stephen
gave
the
order
for
the
chaise
as
they
passed
through
the
yard
.
<EOS>
Maggie
took
no
notice
of
this
,
and
only
said
,
"
Ask
them
to
show
us
into
a
room
where
we
can
sit
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
When
they
entered
,
Maggie
did
not
sit
down
,
and
Stephen
,
whose
face
had
a
desperate
determination
in
it
,
was
about
to
ring
the
bell
,
when
she
said
,
in
a
firm
voice
,
    
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
going
;
we
must
part
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
"
he
said
,
turning
round
toward
her
,
and
speaking
in
the
tones
of
a
man
who
feels
a
process
of
torture
beginning
,
"
do
you
mean
to
kill
me
?
<EOS>
What
is
the
use
of
it
now
?
<EOS>
The
whole
thing
is
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
is
not
done
,
"
said
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
Too
much
is
done
,
 
more
than
we
can
ever
remove
the
trace
of
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
go
no
farther
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
try
to
prevail
with
me
again
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
choose
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
was
he
to
do
?
<EOS>
He
dared
not
go
near
her
;
her
anger
might
leap
out
,
and
make
a
new
barrier
.
<EOS>
He
walked
backward
and
forward
in
maddening
perplexity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
"
he
said
at
last
,
pausing
before
her
,
and
speaking
in
a
tone
of
imploring
wretchedness
,
"
have
some
pity
 
<EOS>
hear
me
 
forgive
me
for
what
I
did
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
will
obey
you
now
;
I
will
do
nothing
without
your
full
consent
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
blight
our
lives
forever
by
a
rash
perversity
that
can
answer
no
good
purpose
to
any
one
,
that
can
only
create
new
evils
.
<EOS>
Sit
down
,
dearest
<EOS>
;
wait
 
think
what
you
are
going
to
do
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
treat
me
as
if
you
could
n't
trust
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
chosen
the
most
effective
appeal
;
but
Maggie
's
will
was
fixed
unswervingly
on
the
coming
wrench
.
<EOS>
She
had
made
up
her
mind
to
suffer
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
not
wait
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
low
but
distinct
voice
;
"
we
must
part
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
_
ca
n't
_
part
,
Maggie
,
"
said
Stephen
,
more
impetuously
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
bear
it
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
use
of
inflicting
that
misery
on
me
?
<EOS>
The
blow
 
whatever
it
may
have
been
 
has
been
struck
now
.
<EOS>
Will
it
help
any
one
else
that
you
should
drive
me
mad
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
begin
any
future
,
even
for
you
,
"
said
Maggie
,
tremulously
,
"
with
a
deliberate
consent
to
what
ought
not
to
have
been
.
<EOS>
What
I
told
you
at
Basset
<EOS>
I
feel
now
;
I
would
rather
have
died
than
fall
into
this
temptation
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
better
if
we
had
parted
forever
then
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
part
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
_
not
_
part
<EOS>
,
"
Stephen
burst
out
,
instinctively
placing
his
back
against
the
door
,
forgetting
everything
he
had
said
a
few
moments
before
;
"
I
will
not
endure
it
.
<EOS>
You
'll
make
me
desperate
;
I
sha'n"t
know
what
I
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
trembled
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
the
parting
could
not
be
effected
suddenly
.
<EOS>
She
must
rely
on
a
slower
appeal
to
Stephen
's
better
self
;
she
must
be
prepared
for
a
harder
task
than
that
of
rushing
away
while
resolution
was
fresh
.
<EOS>
She
sat
down
.
<EOS>
Stephen
,
watching
her
with
that
look
of
desperation
which
had
come
over
him
like
a
lurid
light
,
approached
slowly
from
the
door
,
seated
himself
close
beside
her
,
and
grasped
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
beat
like
the
heart
of
a
frightened
bird
;
but
this
direct
opposition
helped
her
.
<EOS>
She
felt
her
determination
growing
stronger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Remember
what
you
felt
weeks
ago
,
"
she
began
,
with
beseeching
earnestness
;
"
remember
what
we
both
felt
,
 
that
we
owed
ourselves
to
others
,
and
must
conquer
every
inclination
which
could
make
us
false
to
that
debt
.
<EOS>
We
have
failed
to
keep
our
resolutions
;
but
the
wrong
remains
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
does
_
not
<EOS>
_
remain
the
same
,
"
said
Stephen
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
proved
that
it
was
impossible
to
keep
our
resolutions
.
<EOS>
We
have
proved
that
the
feeling
which
draws
us
toward
each
other
is
too
strong
to
be
overcome
.
<EOS>
That
natural
law
surmounts
every
other
;
we
ca
n't
help
what
it
clashes
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
so
,
Stephen
;
I
'm
quite
sure
that
is
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
have
tried
to
think
it
again
and
again
;
but
I
see
,
if
we
judged
in
that
way
,
there
would
be
a
warrant
for
all
treachery
and
cruelty
;
we
should
justify
breaking
the
most
sacred
ties
that
can
ever
be
formed
on
earth
.
<EOS>
If
the
past
is
not
to
bind
us
,
where
can
duty
lie
?
<EOS>
We
should
have
no
law
but
<EOS>
the
inclination
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
are
ties
that
ca
n't
be
kept
by
mere
resolution
,
"
said
Stephen
,
starting
up
and
walking
about
again
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
outward
faithfulness
?
<EOS>
Would
they
have
thanked
us
for
anything
so
hollow
as
constancy
without
love
?
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
did
not
answer
immediately
.
<EOS>
She
was
undergoing
an
inward
as
well
as
an
outward
contest
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
said
,
with
a
passionate
assertion
of
her
conviction
,
as
much
against
herself
as
against
him
,
    
"
That
seems
right
 
at
first
;
but
when
I
look
further
,
I
'm
sure
it
is
_
not
_
right
.
<EOS>
Faithfulness
and
constancy
mean
something
else
besides
doing
what
is
easiest
and
pleasantest
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
They
mean
renouncing
whatever
is
opposed
to
the
reliance
others
have
in
us
,
 
whatever
would
cause
misery
to
those
whom
the
course
of
our
lives
has
made
dependent
on
us
.
<EOS>
If
we
 
if
I
had
been
better
,
nobler
,
those
claims
would
have
been
so
strongly
present
with
me
,
 
I
should
have
felt
them
pressing
on
my
heart
so
continually
,
just
as
they
do
now
in
the
moments
when
my
conscience
is
awake
,
 
that
the
opposite
feeling
would
never
have
grown
in
me
,
as
it
has
done
;
it
would
have
been
quenched
at
once
,
I
should
have
prayed
for
help
so
earnestly
,
I
should
have
rushed
away
as
we
rush
from
hideous
danger
.
<EOS>
I
feel
no
excuse
for
myself
,
none
.
<EOS>
I
should
never
have
failed
toward
Lucy
and
Philip
as
I
have
done
,
if
I
had
not
been
weak
,
selfish
,
and
hard
,
 
able
to
think
of
their
pain
without
a
pain
to
myself
that
would
have
destroyed
all
temptation
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
is
Lucy
feeling
now
?
<EOS>
She
believed
in
me
 
she
loved
me
 
<EOS>
she
was
so
good
to
me
.
<EOS>
Think
of
her
   
<EOS>
"
  
Maggie
's
voice
was
getting
choked
as
she
uttered
these
last
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
ca
n't
_
think
of
her
,
"
said
Stephen
,
stamping
as
if
with
pain
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
think
of
nothing
<EOS>
but
you
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
You
demand
of
a
man
what
is
impossible
.
<EOS>
I
felt
that
once
;
but
I
ca
n't
go
back
to
it
now
.
<EOS>
And
where
is
the
use
of
_
your
_
thinking
of
it
,
except
to
torture
me
?
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
save
them
from
pain
now
;
you
can
only
tear
yourself
from
me
,
and
make
my
life
worthless
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
even
if
we
could
go
back
,
and
both
fulfil
our
engagements
,
 
if
that
were
possible
now
,
 
it
would
be
hateful
,
horrible
,
to
think
of
your
ever
being
<EOS>
Philip
's
wife
,
 
of
your
ever
being
the
wife
of
a
man
you
did
n't
love
.
<EOS>
We
have
both
been
rescued
from
a
mistake
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
deep
flush
came
over
Maggie
's
face
,
and
she
could
n't
speak
.
<EOS>
Stephen
saw
this
.
<EOS>
He
sat
down
again
,
taking
her
hand
in
his
,
and
looking
at
her
with
passionate
entreaty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
!
<EOS>
Dearest
!
<EOS>
If
you
love
me
,
you
are
mine
.
<EOS>
Who
can
have
so
great
a
claim
on
you
as
I
have
?
<EOS>
My
life
is
bound
up
in
your
love
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
in
the
past
that
can
annul
our
right
to
each
other
;
it
is
the
first
time
we
have
either
of
us
loved
with
our
whole
heart
and
soul
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
was
still
silent
for
a
little
while
,
looking
down
.
<EOS>
Stephen
was
in
a
flutter
of
new
hope
;
he
was
going
to
triumph
.
<EOS>
But
she
raised
her
eyes
and
met
his
with
a
glance
that
was
filled
with
the
anguish
of
regret
,
not
with
yielding
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
with
my
whole
heart
and
soul
,
Stephen
,
"
she
said
with
timid
resolution
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
consented
to
it
with
my
whole
mind
.
<EOS>
There
are
memories
,
and
affections
,
and
longings
after
perfect
goodness
,
that
have
such
a
strong
hold
on
me
;
they
would
never
quit
me
for
long
;
they
would
come
back
and
be
pain
to
me
 
repentance
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
live
in
peace
if
I
put
the
shadow
of
a
wilful
sin
between
myself
and
God
.
<EOS>
I
have
caused
sorrow
already
 
<EOS>
I
know
 
<EOS>
I
feel
it
;
but
I
have
never
deliberately
consented
to
it
;
I
have
never
said
,
"
They
shall
suffer
,
that
I
may
have
joy
.
<EOS>
"
It
has
never
been
my
will
to
marry
you
;
if
you
were
to
win
consent
from
the
momentary
triumph
of
my
feeling
for
you
,
you
would
not
have
my
whole
soul
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
wake
back
again
into
the
time
before
yesterday
,
I
would
choose
to
be
true
to
my
calmer
affections
,
and
live
without
the
joy
of
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
loosed
her
hand
,
and
rising
impatiently
,
walked
up
and
down
the
room
in
suppressed
rage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
God
!
"
<EOS>
he
burst
out
at
last
,
"
what
a
miserable
thing
a
woman
's
love
is
to
a
man
's
!
<EOS>
I
could
commit
crimes
for
you
,
 
and
you
can
balance
and
choose
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
But
you
_
do
n't
_
love
me
;
if
you
had
a
tithe
of
the
feeling
for
me
that
I
have
for
you
,
it
would
be
impossible
to
you
to
think
for
a
moment
of
sacrificing
me
.
<EOS>
But
it
weighs
nothing
with
you
that
you
are
robbing
me
of
_
my
_
life
's
happiness
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
pressed
her
fingers
together
almost
convulsively
as
she
held
them
clasped
on
her
lap
.
<EOS>
A
great
terror
was
upon
her
,
as
if
she
were
ever
and
anon
seeing
where
she
stood
by
great
flashes
of
lightning
,
and
then
again
stretched
forth
her
hands
in
the
darkness
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
n't
sacrifice
you
 
I
could
n't
sacrifice
you
,
"
she
said
,
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
again
;
"
but
I
ca
n't
believe
in
a
good
for
you
,
that
I
feel
,
that
we
both
feel
,
is
a
wrong
toward
others
.
<EOS>
We
ca
n't
choose
happiness
either
for
ourselves
or
for
another
;
we
ca
n't
tell
where
that
will
lie
.
<EOS>
We
can
only
choose
whether
we
will
indulge
ourselves
in
the
present
moment
,
or
whether
we
will
renounce
that
,
for
the
sake
of
obeying
the
divine
voice
within
us
,
 
for
the
sake
of
being
true
to
all
the
motives
that
sanctify
our
lives
.
<EOS>
I
know
this
belief
is
hard
;
it
has
slipped
away
from
me
again
and
again
;
but
I
have
felt
that
if
I
let
it
go
forever
,
I
should
have
no
light
through
the
darkness
of
this
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Maggie
,
"
said
Stephen
,
seating
himself
by
her
again
,
"
is
it
possible
<EOS>
you
do
n't
see
that
what
happened
yesterday
has
altered
the
whole
position
of
things
?
<EOS>
What
infatuation
is
it
,
what
obstinate
prepossession
,
that
blinds
you
to
that
?
<EOS>
It
is
too
late
to
say
what
we
might
have
done
or
what
we
ought
to
have
done
.
<EOS>
Admitting
the
very
worst
view
of
what
has
been
done
,
it
is
a
fact
we
must
act
on
now
;
our
position
is
altered
;
the
right
course
is
no
longer
what
it
was
before
.
<EOS>
We
must
accept
our
own
actions
and
start
afresh
from
them
.
<EOS>
Suppose
we
had
been
married
yesterday
?
<EOS>
It
is
nearly
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
The
effect
on
others
would
not
have
been
different
.
<EOS>
It
would
only
have
made
this
difference
to
ourselves
,
"
Stephen
added
bitterly
,
"
that
you
might
have
acknowledged
then
that
your
tie
to
me
was
stronger
than
to
others
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
a
deep
flush
came
over
Maggie
's
face
,
and
she
was
silent
.
<EOS>
Stephen
thought
again
that
he
was
beginning
to
prevail
,
 
he
had
never
yet
believed
that
he
should
_
not
_
prevail
;
there
are
possibilities
which
our
minds
shrink
from
too
completely
for
us
to
fear
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dearest
,
"
he
said
,
in
his
deepest
,
tenderest
tone
,
leaning
toward
her
,
and
putting
his
arm
round
her
,
"
you
_
are
_
mine
now
,
 
the
world
believes
it
;
duty
must
spring
out
of
that
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
a
few
hours
you
will
be
legally
mine
,
and
those
who
had
claims
on
us
will
submit
,
 
<EOS>
they
will
see
that
there
was
a
force
which
declared
against
their
claims
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
eyes
opened
wide
in
one
terrified
look
at
the
face
that
was
close
to
hers
,
and
she
started
up
,
pale
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
do
it
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
voice
almost
of
agony
;
"
Stephen
,
do
n't
ask
me
 
do
n't
urge
me
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
argue
any
longer
,
 
I
do
n't
know
what
is
wise
;
but
my
heart
will
not
let
me
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
see
,
 
I
feel
their
trouble
now
;
it
is
as
if
it
were
branded
on
my
mind
.
<EOS>
_
I
_
have
suffered
,
and
had
no
one
to
pity
me
;
and
now
I
have
made
others
suffer
.
<EOS>
It
would
never
leave
me
;
it
would
embitter
your
love
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
_
do
_
care
for
Philip
 
in
a
different
way
;
I
remember
all
we
said
to
each
other
;
I
know
how
he
thought
of
me
as
the
one
promise
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
was
given
to
me
that
I
might
make
his
lot
less
hard
;
and
I
have
forsaken
him
.
<EOS>
And
Lucy
 
she
has
been
deceived
;
she
who
trusted
me
more
than
any
one
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
marry
you
;
I
can
not
take
a
good
for
myself
that
has
been
wrung
out
of
their
misery
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
the
force
that
ought
to
rule
us
,
 
this
that
we
feel
for
each
other
;
it
would
rend
me
away
from
all
that
my
past
life
has
made
dear
and
holy
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
set
out
on
a
fresh
life
,
and
forget
that
;
I
must
go
back
to
it
,
and
cling
to
it
,
else
I
shall
feel
as
if
there
were
nothing
firm
beneath
my
feet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
God
,
Maggie
!
<EOS>
"
said
Stephen
,
rising
too
and
grasping
her
arm
,
"
you
rave
.
<EOS>
How
can
you
go
back
without
marrying
me
?
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
what
will
be
said
,
dearest
.
<EOS>
You
see
nothing
as
it
really
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
But
they
will
believe
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
confess
everything
.
<EOS>
Lucy
will
believe
me
 
she
will
forgive
you
,
and
 
and
 
oh
,
_
<EOS>
some
_
good
will
come
by
clinging
to
the
right
.
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
Stephen
,
let
me
go
!
 
<EOS>
do
n't
drag
me
into
deeper
remorse
.
<EOS>
My
whole
soul
has
never
consented
;
it
does
not
consent
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
let
go
her
arm
,
and
sank
back
on
his
chair
,
half
-
stunned
by
despairing
rage
.
<EOS>
He
was
silent
a
few
moments
,
not
looking
at
her
;
while
her
eyes
were
turned
toward
him
yearningly
,
in
alarm
at
this
sudden
change
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
said
,
still
without
looking
at
her
,
    
"
Go
,
then
,
 
leave
me
;
do
n't
torture
me
any
longer
,
 
I
ca
n't
bear
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Involuntarily
she
leaned
toward
him
and
put
out
her
hand
to
touch
his
.
<EOS>
But
he
shrank
from
it
as
if
it
had
been
burning
iron
,
and
said
again
,
    
"
Leave
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
was
not
conscious
of
a
decision
as
she
turned
away
from
that
gloomy
averted
face
,
and
walked
out
of
the
room
;
it
was
like
an
automatic
action
that
fulfils
a
forgotten
intention
.
<EOS>
What
came
after
?
<EOS>
A
sense
of
stairs
descended
as
if
in
a
dream
,
of
flagstones
,
of
a
chaise
and
horses
standing
,
then
a
street
,
and
a
turning
into
another
street
where
a
stage
-
coach
was
standing
,
taking
in
passengers
,
and
the
darting
thought
that
that
coach
would
take
her
away
,
perhaps
toward
home
.
<EOS>
But
she
could
ask
nothing
yet
;
she
only
got
into
the
coach
.
  
<EOS>
Home
 
<EOS>
where
her
mother
and
brother
were
,
Philip
,
Lucy
,
<EOS>
the
scene
of
her
very
cares
and
trials
 
was
the
haven
toward
which
her
mind
tended
;
the
sanctuary
where
sacred
relics
lay
,
where
she
would
be
rescued
from
more
falling
.
<EOS>
The
thought
of
Stephen
was
like
a
horrible
throbbing
pain
,
which
yet
,
as
such
pains
do
,
seemed
to
urge
all
other
thoughts
into
activity
.
<EOS>
But
among
her
thoughts
,
what
others
would
say
and
think
of
her
conduct
was
hardly
present
.
<EOS>
Love
and
deep
pity
and
remorseful
anguish
left
no
room
for
that
.
  
<EOS>
The
coach
was
taking
her
to
York
,
farther
away
from
home
;
but
she
did
not
learn
that
until
she
was
set
down
in
the
old
city
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
matter
;
she
could
sleep
there
,
and
start
home
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
She
had
her
purse
in
her
pocket
,
with
all
her
money
in
it
,
 
a
bank
-
note
and
a
sovereign
;
she
had
kept
it
in
her
pocket
from
forgetfulness
,
after
going
out
to
make
purchases
the
day
before
yesterday
.
  
<EOS>
Did
she
lie
down
in
the
gloomy
bedroom
of
the
old
inn
that
night
with
her
will
bent
unwaveringly
on
the
path
of
penitent
sacrifice
?
<EOS>
The
great
struggles
of
life
are
not
so
easy
as
that
;
the
great
problems
of
life
are
not
so
clear
.
<EOS>
In
the
darkness
of
that
night
she
saw
Stephen
's
face
turned
toward
her
in
passionate
,
reproachful
misery
;
she
lived
through
again
all
the
tremulous
delights
of
his
presence
with
her
that
made
existence
an
easy
floating
in
a
stream
of
joy
,
instead
of
a
quiet
resolved
endurance
and
effort
.
<EOS>
The
love
she
had
renounced
came
back
upon
her
with
a
cruel
charm
;
she
felt
herself
opening
her
arms
to
receive
it
once
more
;
and
then
it
seemed
to
slip
away
and
fade
and
vanish
,
leaving
only
the
dying
sound
of
a
deep
,
thrilling
voice
that
said
,
"
Gone
,
forever
gone
.

The
Final
Rescue
<EOS>
_
  
<EOS>
The
Return
to
the
Mill
  
Between
four
and
five
o'clock
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fifth
day
from
that
on
which
Stephen
and
Maggie
had
left
St.
Ogg
's
,
Tom
Tulliver
was
standing
on
the
gravel
walk
outside
the
old
house
at
Dorlcote
Mill
.
<EOS>
He
was
master
there
now
;
he
had
half
fulfilled
his
father
's
dying
wish
,
and
by
years
of
steady
self
-
government
and
energetic
work
he
had
brought
himself
near
to
the
attainment
of
more
than
the
old
respectability
which
had
been
the
proud
inheritance
of
the
Dodsons
and
Tullivers
.
  
<EOS>
But
Tom
's
face
,
as
he
stood
in
the
hot
,
still
sunshine
of
that
summer
afternoon
,
had
no
gladness
,
no
triumph
in
it
.
<EOS>
His
mouth
wore
its
bitterest
expression
,
his
severe
brow
its
hardest
and
deepest
fold
,
as
he
drew
down
his
hat
farther
over
his
eyes
to
shelter
them
from
the
sun
,
and
thrusting
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
,
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
gravel
.
<EOS>
No
news
of
his
sister
had
been
heard
since
Bob
Jakin
had
come
back
in
the
steamer
from
Mudport
,
and
put
an
end
to
all
improbable
suppositions
of
an
accident
on
the
water
by
stating
that
he
had
seen
her
land
from
a
vessel
with
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
.
<EOS>
Would
the
next
news
be
that
she
was
married
,
 
or
what
?
<EOS>
Probably
that
she
was
not
married
;
Tom
's
mind
was
set
to
the
expectation
of
the
worst
that
could
happen
,
 
not
death
,
but
disgrace
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
was
walking
with
his
back
toward
the
entrance
gate
,
and
his
face
toward
the
rushing
mill
-
stream
,
a
tall
,
dark
-
eyed
figure
,
that
we
know
well
,
approached
the
gate
,
and
paused
to
look
at
him
with
a
fast
-
beating
heart
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
was
the
human
being
of
whom
she
had
been
most
afraid
from
her
childhood
upward
;
afraid
with
that
fear
which
springs
in
us
when
we
love
one
who
is
inexorable
,
unbending
,
unmodifiable
,
with
a
mind
that
we
can
never
mould
ourselves
upon
,
and
yet
that
we
can
not
endure
to
alienate
from
us
.
  
<EOS>
That
deep
-
rooted
fear
was
shaking
Maggie
now
;
but
her
mind
was
unswervingly
bent
on
returning
to
her
brother
,
as
the
natural
refuge
that
had
been
given
her
.
<EOS>
In
her
deep
humiliation
under
the
retrospect
of
her
own
weakness
,
 
in
her
anguish
at
the
injury
she
had
inflicted
,
 
she
almost
desired
to
endure
the
severity
of
Tom
's
reproof
,
to
submit
in
patient
silence
to
that
harsh
,
disapproving
judgment
against
which
she
had
so
often
rebelled
;
it
seemed
no
more
than
just
to
her
now
,
 
who
was
weaker
than
she
was
?
<EOS>
She
craved
that
outward
help
to
her
better
purpose
which
would
come
from
complete
,
submissive
confession
;
from
being
in
the
presence
of
those
whose
looks
and
words
would
be
a
reflection
of
her
own
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
had
been
kept
on
her
bed
at
York
for
a
day
with
that
prostrating
headache
which
was
likely
to
follow
on
the
terrible
strain
of
the
previous
day
and
night
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
expression
of
physical
pain
still
about
her
brow
and
eyes
,
and
her
whole
appearance
,
with
her
dress
so
long
unchanged
,
was
worn
and
distressed
.
<EOS>
She
lifted
the
latch
of
the
gate
and
walked
in
slowly
.
<EOS>
Tom
did
not
hear
the
gate
;
he
was
just
then
close
upon
the
roaring
dam
;
but
he
presently
turned
,
and
lifting
up
his
eyes
,
saw
the
figure
whose
worn
look
and
loneliness
seemed
to
him
a
confirmation
of
his
worst
conjectures
.
<EOS>
He
paused
,
trembling
and
white
with
disgust
and
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
paused
too
,
three
yards
before
him
.
<EOS>
She
felt
the
hatred
in
his
face
,
felt
it
rushing
through
her
fibres
;
but
she
must
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
"
she
began
faintly
,
"
I
am
come
back
to
you
,
 
<EOS>
I
am
come
back
home
 
for
refuge
 
to
tell
you
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
no
home
with
me
,
"
he
answered
,
with
tremulous
rage
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
disgraced
us
all
.
<EOS>
You
have
disgraced
my
father
's
name
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
a
curse
to
your
best
friends
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
base
,
deceitful
;
no
motives
are
strong
enough
to
restrain
you
.
<EOS>
I
wash
my
hands
of
you
forever
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
belong
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Their
mother
had
come
to
the
door
now
.
<EOS>
She
stood
paralyzed
by
the
double
shock
of
seeing
Maggie
and
hearing
Tom
's
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
"
said
Maggie
,
with
more
courage
,
"
I
am
perhaps
not
so
guilty
as
you
believe
me
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
never
meant
to
give
way
to
my
feelings
.
<EOS>
I
struggled
against
them
.
<EOS>
I
was
carried
too
far
in
the
boat
to
come
back
on
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
I
came
back
as
soon
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
believe
in
you
any
more
,
"
said
Tom
,
gradually
passing
from
the
tremulous
excitement
of
the
first
moment
to
cold
inflexibility
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
carrying
on
a
clandestine
relation
with
Stephen
Guest
,
 
as
you
did
before
with
another
.
<EOS>
He
went
to
see
you
at
my
aunt
Moss
's
;
you
walked
alone
with
him
in
the
lanes
;
you
must
have
behaved
as
no
modest
girl
would
have
done
to
her
cousin
's
lover
,
else
that
could
never
have
happened
.
<EOS>
The
people
at
Luckreth
saw
you
pass
;
you
passed
all
the
other
places
;
you
knew
what
you
were
doing
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
using
Philip
Wakem
as
a
screen
to
deceive
Lucy
,
 
the
kindest
friend
you
ever
had
.
<EOS>
Go
and
see
the
return
you
have
made
her
.
<EOS>
She
's
ill
;
unable
to
speak
.
<EOS>
My
mother
ca
n't
go
near
her
,
lest
she
should
remind
her
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
was
half
stunned
,
 
too
heavily
pressed
upon
by
her
anguish
even
to
discern
any
difference
between
her
actual
guilt
and
her
brother
's
accusations
,
still
less
to
vindicate
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
"
she
said
,
crushing
her
hands
together
under
her
cloak
,
in
the
effort
to
speak
again
,
"
whatever
I
have
done
,
I
repent
it
bitterly
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
make
amends
.
<EOS>
I
will
endure
anything
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
be
kept
from
doing
wrong
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
_
will
_
keep
you
?
"
said
Tom
,
with
cruel
bitterness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
religion
;
not
your
natural
feelings
of
gratitude
and
honor
.
<EOS>
And
he
 
he
would
deserve
to
be
shot
,
if
it
were
not
   
<EOS>
But
you
are
ten
times
worse
than
he
is
.
<EOS>
I
loathe
your
character
and
your
conduct
.
<EOS>
You
struggled
with
your
feelings
,
you
say
.
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
_
I
_
have
had
feelings
to
struggle
with
;
but
I
conquered
them
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
a
harder
life
than
you
have
had
;
but
I
have
found
_
<EOS>
my
_
comfort
in
doing
my
duty
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
sanction
no
such
character
as
yours
;
the
world
shall
know
that
_
I
_
feel
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
in
want
,
I
will
provide
for
you
;
let
my
mother
know
.
<EOS>
But
you
shall
not
come
under
my
roof
.
<EOS>
It
is
enough
that
I
have
to
bear
the
thought
of
your
disgrace
;
the
sight
of
you
is
hateful
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Slowly
Maggie
was
turning
away
with
despair
in
her
heart
.
<EOS>
But
the
poor
frightened
mother
's
love
leaped
out
now
,
stronger
than
all
dread
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
child
!
<EOS>
I
'll
go
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
've
got
a
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
sweet
rest
of
that
embrace
to
the
heart
-
stricken
Maggie
!
<EOS>
More
helpful
than
all
wisdom
is
one
draught
of
simple
human
pity
that
will
not
forsake
us
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
turned
and
walked
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
my
child
,
"
Mrs.
Tulliver
whispered
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
'll
let
you
stay
and
sleep
in
my
bed
.
<EOS>
He
wo
n't
deny
that
if
I
ask
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
mother
,
"
said
Maggie
,
in
a
low
tone
,
like
a
moan
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
go
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
wait
for
me
outside
.
<EOS>
I
'll
get
ready
and
come
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
When
his
mother
appeared
with
her
bonnet
on
,
Tom
came
out
to
her
in
the
passage
,
and
put
money
into
her
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
house
is
yours
,
mother
,
always
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
come
and
let
me
know
everything
you
want
;
you
will
come
back
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
took
the
money
,
too
frightened
to
say
anything
.
<EOS>
The
only
thing
clear
to
her
was
the
mother
's
instinct
that
she
would
go
with
her
unhappy
child
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
was
waiting
outside
the
gate
;
she
took
her
mother
's
hand
and
they
walked
a
little
way
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
said
Maggie
,
at
last
,
"
we
will
go
to
Luke
's
cottage
.
<EOS>
Luke
will
take
me
in
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
good
to
me
when
I
was
a
little
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
got
no
room
for
us
,
my
dear
,
now
;
his
wife
's
got
so
many
children
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
where
to
go
,
if
it
is
n't
to
<EOS>
one
o
'
your
aunts
;
<EOS>
and
I
hardly
durst
,
"
said
poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
quite
destitute
of
mental
resources
in
this
extremity
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
was
silent
a
little
while
,
and
then
said
,
    
"
Let
us
go
to
Bob
Jakin
's
,
mother
;
his
wife
will
have
room
for
us
,
if
they
have
no
other
lodger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
they
went
on
their
way
to
St.
Ogg
's
,
to
the
old
house
by
the
river
-
side
.
  
<EOS>
Bob
himself
was
at
home
,
with
a
heaviness
at
heart
which
resisted
even
the
new
joy
and
pride
of
possessing
a
two
-
months
'
 
old
baby
,
quite
the
liveliest
of
its
age
that
had
ever
been
born
to
prince
or
packman
.
<EOS>
He
would
perhaps
not
so
thoroughly
have
understood
all
the
dubiousness
of
Maggie
's
appearance
with
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
on
the
quay
at
Mudport
if
he
had
not
witnessed
the
effect
it
produced
on
Tom
when
he
went
to
report
it
;
and
since
then
,
the
circumstances
which
in
any
case
gave
a
disastrous
character
to
her
elopement
had
passed
beyond
the
more
polite
circles
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
had
become
matter
of
common
talk
,
accessible
to
the
grooms
and
errand
-
boys
.
<EOS>
So
that
when
he
opened
the
door
and
saw
Maggie
standing
before
him
in
her
sorrow
and
weariness
,
he
had
no
questions
to
ask
except
one
which
he
dared
only
ask
himself
,
 
where
was
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
?
<EOS>
Bob
,
for
his
part
,
hoped
he
might
be
in
the
warmest
department
of
an
asylum
understood
to
exist
in
the
other
world
for
gentlemen
who
are
likely
to
be
in
fallen
circumstances
there
.
  
<EOS>
The
lodgings
were
vacant
,
and
both
Mrs.
Jakin
the
larger
and
Mrs.
Jakin
the
less
were
commanded
to
make
all
things
comfortable
for
"
the
old
Missis
and
the
young
Miss
"
;
alas
that
she
was
still
"
Miss
!
"
<EOS>
The
ingenious
Bob
was
sorely
perplexed
as
to
how
this
result
could
have
come
about
;
how
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
could
have
gone
away
from
her
,
or
could
have
let
her
go
away
from
him
,
when
he
had
the
chance
of
keeping
her
with
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
silent
,
and
would
not
allow
his
wife
to
ask
him
a
question
;
would
not
present
himself
in
the
room
,
lest
it
should
appear
like
intrusion
and
a
wish
to
pry
;
having
the
same
chivalry
toward
dark
-
eyed
Maggie
as
in
the
days
when
he
had
bought
her
the
memorable
present
of
books
.
  
<EOS>
But
after
a
day
or
two
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
gone
to
the
Mill
again
for
a
few
hours
to
see
to
Tom
's
household
matters
.
<EOS>
Maggie
had
wished
this
;
after
the
first
violent
outburst
of
feeling
which
came
as
soon
as
she
had
no
longer
any
active
purpose
to
fulfil
,
she
was
less
in
need
of
her
mother
's
presence
;
she
even
desired
to
be
alone
with
her
grief
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
been
solitary
only
a
little
while
in
the
old
sitting
-
room
that
looked
on
the
river
,
when
there
came
a
tap
at
the
door
,
and
turning
round
her
sad
face
as
she
said
"
Come
in
,
"
she
saw
Bob
enter
,
with
the
baby
in
his
arms
and
Mumps
at
his
heels
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
'll
go
back
,
if
it
disturbs
you
,
Miss
,
"
said
Bob
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Maggie
,
in
a
low
voice
,
wishing
she
could
smile
.
  
<EOS>
Bob
,
closing
the
door
behind
him
,
came
and
stood
before
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
we
've
got
a
little
un
,
Miss
,
and
I
<EOS>
want'd
you
to
look
at
it
,
and
take
it
in
your
arms
,
if
you
'd
be
so
good
.
<EOS>
For
we
made
free
to
name
it
after
you
,
and
it
'
ud
be
better
for
your
takin
'
a
bit
o
'
notice
on
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
could
not
speak
,
but
she
put
out
her
arms
to
receive
the
tiny
baby
,
while
Mumps
snuffed
at
it
anxiously
,
to
ascertain
that
this
transference
was
all
right
.
<EOS>
Maggie
's
heart
had
swelled
at
this
action
and
speech
of
Bob
's
;
she
knew
well
enough
that
it
was
a
way
he
had
chosen
to
show
his
sympathy
and
respect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
Bob
,
"
she
said
presently
,
and
he
sat
down
in
silence
,
finding
his
tongue
unmanageable
in
quite
a
new
fashion
,
refusing
to
say
what
he
wanted
it
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bob
,
"
she
said
,
after
a
few
moments
,
looking
down
at
the
baby
,
and
holding
it
anxiously
,
as
if
she
feared
it
might
slip
from
her
mind
and
her
fingers
,
"
I
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
you
speak
so
,
Miss
,
"
said
Bob
,
grasping
the
skin
of
Mumps
's
neck
;
"
if
there
's
anything
I
can
do
for
you
,
I
should
look
upon
it
as
a
day
's
earnings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
go
to
Dr.
Kenn
's
,
and
ask
to
speak
to
him
,
and
tell
him
that
I
am
here
,
and
should
be
very
grateful
if
he
would
come
to
me
while
my
mother
is
away
.
<EOS>
She
will
not
come
back
till
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
Miss
,
I
'd
do
it
in
a
minute
,
 
it
is
but
<EOS>
a
step
,
 
but
Dr.
Kenn
's
wife
lies
dead
;
she
's
to
be
buried
to

morrow
;
died
the
day
I
come
from
Mudport

<EOS>
It
's
all
the
more
pity
she
should
ha

died
just
now
,
if
you
want
him

<EOS>
I
hardly

nigh
him
yet

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
Bob
,
"
said
Maggie
,
"
we
must
let
it
be
,
 
till
after
a
few
days
,
perhaps
,
when
you
hear
that
he
is
going
about
again
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
he
may
be
going
out
of
town
 
to
a
distance
,
"
she
added
,
with
a
new
sense
of
despondency
at
this
idea
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not

,
Miss

"
said
Bob
.
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He

<EOS>
He

sharp

he
does

<EOS>
He
christened
the

un

at

me

what
I
did
of
a
Sunday

I
told

<EOS>
Eh

<EOS>
It

"
  
<EOS>
Bob
's
tongue
was
now
evidently
loosed
from
its
unwonted
bondage
,
and
might
even
be
in
danger
of
doing
more
work
than
was
required
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
subjects
on
which
he
longed
to
be
informed
were
so
steep
and
difficult
of
approach
,
that
his
tongue
was
likely
to
run
on
along
the
level
rather
than
to
carry
him
on
that
unbeaten
road
.
<EOS>
He
felt
this
,
and
was
silent
again
for
a
little
while
,
ruminating
much
on
the
possible
forms
in
which
he
might
put
a
question
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
said
,
in
a
more
timid
voice
than
usual
,
    
"
Will
you
give
me
leave
to
ask
you
only
one
thing
,
Miss
?
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
was
rather
startled
,
but
she
answered
,
"
Yes
,
Bob
,
if
it
is
about
myself
 
not
about
any
one
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Miss
,
it
's
this
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Do
_
you
owe
anybody
a
grudge
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
any
one
,
"
said
Maggie
,
looking
up
at
him
inquiringly
.
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
lors
,
Miss
,
"
said
Bob
,
pinching
Mumps
's
neck
harder
than
ever
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
did
,
an
'
tell
me
;
I
'd
leather
him
till
I
could
n't
see
 
I
would
 
<EOS>
an
'
the
Justice
might
do
what
he
liked
to
me
arter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Bob
,
"
said
Maggie
,
smiling
faintly
,
"
you
're
a
very
good
friend
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
n't
like
to
punish
any
one
,
even
if
they
'd
done
me
wrong
;
I
've
done
wrong
myself
too
often
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
view
of
things
was
puzzling
to
Bob
,
and
threw
more
obscurity
than
ever
over
what
could
possibly
have
happened
between
Stephen
and
Maggie
.
<EOS>
But
further
questions
would
have
been
too
intrusive
,
even
if
he
could
have
framed
them
suitably
,
and
he
was
obliged
to
carry
baby
away
again
to
an
expectant
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Happen
you
'd
like
Mumps
for
company
,
Miss
,
"
he
said
when
he
had
taken
the
baby
again
.
"
<EOS>
He
's
rare
company
,
Mumps
is
;
he
knows
iverything
,
an
'
makes
no
bother
about
it
.
<EOS>
If
I
tell
him
,
he
'll
lie
before
you
an
'
watch
you
,
as
still
,
 
just
as
he
watches
my
pack
.
<EOS>
You
'd
better
let
me
leave
him
a
bit
;
he
'll
get
fond
on
you
.
<EOS>
Lors
,
it
's
a
fine
thing
to
hev
a
dumb
brute
fond
on
you
;
it
'll
stick
to
you
,
an
'
make
no
jaw
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
do
leave
him
,
please
,
"
said
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
should
like
to
have
Mumps
for
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mumps
,
lie
down
there
,
"
said
Bob
,
pointing
to
a
place
in
front
of
Maggie
,
"
and
niver
<EOS>
do
you
stir
till
you
're
spoke
to
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mumps
lay
down
at
once
,
and
made
no
sign
of
restlessness
when
his
master
left
the
room
.
    
<EOS>
St.
Ogg
's
Passes
Judgment
  
<EOS>
It
was
soon
known
throughout
St.
Ogg
's
that
Miss
Tulliver
was
come
back
<EOS>
;
she
had
not
,
then
,
eloped
in
order
to
be
married
to
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
,
 
at
all
events
,
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
had
not
married
her
;
which
came
to
the
same
thing
,
so
far
as
her
culpability
was
concerned
.
<EOS>
We
judge
others
according
to
results
;
how
else
?
 
not
knowing
the
process
by
which
results
are
arrived
at
.
<EOS>
If
Miss
Tulliver
,
after
a
few
months
of
well
-
chosen
travel
,
had
returned
as
Mrs.
Stephen
Guest
,
with
a
post
-
marital
_
trousseau
_
,
and
all
the
advantages
possessed
even
by
the
most
unwelcome
wife
of
an
only
son
,
public
opinion
,
which
at
St.
Ogg
's
,
as
else
where
,
always
knew
what
to
think
,
would
have
judged
in
strict
consistency
with
those
results
.
<EOS>
Public
opinion
,
in
these
cases
,
is
always
of
the
feminine
gender
,
 
not
the
world
,
but
the
world
's
wife
;
and
she
would
have
seen
that
two
handsome
young
people
 
the
gentleman
of
quite
the
first
family
in
St.
Ogg
's
 
having
found
themselves
in
a
false
position
,
had
been
led
into
a
course
which
,
to
say
the
least
of
it
,
was
highly
injudicious
,
and
productive
of
sad
pain
and
disappointment
,
especially
to
that
sweet
young
thing
,
Miss
Deane
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
had
certainly
not
behaved
well
;
but
then
,
young
men
were
liable
to
those
sudden
infatuated
attachments
;
and
bad
as
it
might
seem
in
Mrs.
Stephen
Guest
to
admit
the
faintest
advances
from
her
cousin
's
lover
<EOS>
(
indeed
it
_
had
_
been
said
that
she
was
actually
engaged
to
young
Wakem
,
 
old
Wakem
himself
had
mentioned
it
)
<EOS>
,
still
,
she
was
very
young
,
 
"
and
a
deformed
young
man
,
you
know
!
 
<EOS>
and
young
Guest
so
very
fascinating
<EOS>
;
and
,
they
say
,
he
positively
worships
her
(
to
be
sure
,
that
ca
n't
last
!
)
,
and
he
ran
away
with
her
in
the
boat
quite
against
her
will
,
and
what
could
she
do
?
<EOS>
She
could
n't
come
back
then
;
no
one
would
have
spoken
to
her
;
and
how
very
well
that
maize
-
colored
satinette
becomes
her
complexion
!
<EOS>
It
seems
as
if
the
folds
in
front
were
quite
come
in
;
several
of
her
dresses
are
made
so
,
 
they
say
he
thinks
nothing
too
handsome
to
buy
for
her
.
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Deane
!
<EOS>
She
is
very
pitiable
;
but
then
there
was
no
positive
engagement
;
and
the
air
at
the
coast
will
do
her
good
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
if
young
Guest
felt
no
more
for
her
than
_
that
_
<EOS>
it
was
better
for
her
not
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
What
a
wonderful
marriage
for
a
girl
like
Miss
Tulliver
,
 
quite
romantic
?
<EOS>
Why
,
young
Guest
will
put
up
for
the
borough
at
the
next
election
.
<EOS>
Nothing
like
commerce
nowadays
!
<EOS>
That
young
Wakem
nearly
went
out
of
his
mind
;
he
always
_
was
_
rather
queer
;
but
he
's
gone
abroad
again
to
be
out
of
the
way
,
 
quite
the
best
thing
for
a
deformed
young
man
.
<EOS>
Miss
Unit
declares
she
will
never
visit
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Stephen
Guest
,
 
such
nonsense
!
<EOS>
pretending
to
be
better
than
other
people
.
<EOS>
Society
could
n't
be
carried
on
if
we
inquired
into
private
conduct
in
that
way
,
 
and
Christianity
tells
us
to
think
no
evil
,
 
and
my
belief
is
,
that
Miss
Unit
had
no
cards
sent
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
results
,
we
know
,
were
not
of
a
kind
to
warrant
this
extenuation
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
Maggie
had
returned
without
a
_
trousseau
_
,
without
a
husband
,
 
in
that
degraded
and
outcast
condition
to
which
error
is
well
known
to
lead
;
and
the
world
's
wife
,
with
that
fine
instinct
which
is
given
her
for
the
preservation
of
Society
,
saw
at
once
that
Miss
Tulliver
's
conduct
had
been
of
the
most
aggravated
kind
.
<EOS>
Could
anything
be
more
detestable
?
<EOS>
A
girl
so
much
indebted
to
her
friends
 
whose
mother
as
well
as
herself
had
received
so
much
kindness
from
the
Deanes
 
to
lay
the
design
of
winning
a
young
man
's
affections
away
from
her
own
cousin
,
who
had
behaved
like
a
sister
to
her
!
<EOS>
Winning
his
affections
?
<EOS>
That
was
not
the
phrase
for
such
a
girl
as
Miss
Tulliver
;
it
would
have
been
more
correct
to
say
that
she
had
been
actuated
by
mere
unwomanly
boldness
and
unbridled
passion
.
<EOS>
There
was
always
something
questionable
about
her
.
<EOS>
That
connection
with
young
Wakem
,
which
,
they
said
,
had
been
carried
on
for
years
,
looked
very
ill
,
 
disgusting
,
in
fact
!
<EOS>
But
with
a
girl
of
that
disposition
!
<EOS>
To
the
world
's
wife
there
had
always
been
something
in
Miss
Tulliver
<EOS>
's
very
_
physique
_
that
a
refined
instinct
felt
to
be
prophetic
of
harm
.
<EOS>
As
for
poor
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
,
he
was
rather
pitiable
than
otherwise
;
a
young
man
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
is
not
to
be
too
severely
judged
in
these
cases
,
 
<EOS>
he
is
really
very
much
at
the
mercy
of
a
designing
,
bold
girl
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
clear
that
he
had
given
way
in
spite
of
himself
:
he
had
shaken
her
off
as
soon
as
he
could
;
indeed
,
their
having
parted
so
soon
looked
very
black
indeed
 
_
for
her
_
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
he
had
written
a
letter
,
laying
all
the
blame
on
himself
,
and
telling
the
story
in
a
romantic
fashion
so
as
to
try
and
make
her
appear
quite
innocent
;
of
course
he
would
do
that
!
<EOS>
But
the
refined
instinct
of
the
world
's
wife
was
not
to
be
deceived
;
providentially
!
 
<EOS>
else
what
would
become
of
Society
?
<EOS>
Why
,
her
own
brother
had
turned
her
from
his
door
;
he
had
seen
enough
,
you
might
be
sure
,
before
he
would
do
that
.
<EOS>
A
truly
respectable
young
man
,
Mr.
Tom
Tulliver
;
quite
likely
to
rise
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
His
sister
's
disgrace
was
naturally
a
heavy
blow
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
be
hoped
that
she
would
go
out
of
the
neighborhood
,
 
to
America
,
or
anywhere
,
 
so
as
to
purify
the
air
of
St.
Ogg
's
from
the
stain
of
her
presence
,
extremely
dangerous
to
daughters
there
!
<EOS>
No
good
could
happen
to
her
;
it
was
only
to
be
hoped
she
would
repent
,
and
that
God
would
have
mercy
on
her
:
<EOS>
He
had
not
the
care
of
society
on
His
hands
,
as
the
world
's
wife
had
.
  
<EOS>
It
required
nearly
a
fortnight
for
fine
instinct
to
assure
itself
of
these
inspirations
;
indeed
,
it
was
a
whole
week
before
Stephen
's
letter
came
,
telling
his
father
the
facts
,
and
adding
that
he
was
gone
across
to
Holland
,
 
had
drawn
upon
the
agent
at
Mudport
for
money
,
 
was
incapable
of
any
resolution
at
present
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
,
all
this
while
,
was
too
entirely
filled
with
a
more
agonizing
anxiety
to
spend
any
thought
on
the
view
that
was
being
taken
of
her
conduct
by
the
world
of
St.
Ogg
's
;
anxiety
about
Stephen
,
Lucy
,
Philip
,
beat
on
her
poor
heart
in
a
hard
,
driving
,
ceaseless
storm
of
mingled
love
,
remorse
,
and
pity
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
thought
of
rejection
and
injustice
at
all
,
it
would
have
seemed
to
her
that
they
had
done
their
worst
;
that
she
could
hardly
feel
any
stroke
from
them
intolerable
since
the
words
she
had
heard
from
her
brother
's
lips
.
<EOS>
Across
all
her
anxiety
for
the
loved
and
the
injured
,
those
words
shot
again
and
again
,
like
a
horrible
pang
that
would
have
brought
misery
and
dread
even
into
a
heaven
of
delights
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
ever
recovering
happiness
never
glimmered
in
her
mind
for
a
moment
;
it
seemed
as
if
every
sensitive
fibre
in
her
were
too
entirely
preoccupied
by
pain
ever
to
vibrate
again
to
another
influence
.
<EOS>
Life
stretched
before
her
as
one
act
of
penitence
;
and
all
she
craved
,
as
she
dwelt
on
her
future
lot
,
was
something
to
guarantee
her
from
more
falling
;
her
own
weakness
haunted
her
like
a
vision
of
hideous
possibilities
,
that
made
no
peace
conceivable
except
such
as
lay
in
the
sense
of
a
sure
refuge
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
was
not
without
practical
intentions
;
the
love
of
independence
was
too
strong
an
inheritance
and
a
habit
for
her
not
to
remember
that
she
must
get
her
bread
;
and
when
other
projects
looked
vague
,
she
fell
back
on
that
of
returning
to
her
plain
sewing
,
and
so
getting
enough
to
pay
for
her
lodging
at
Bob
's
.
<EOS>
She
meant
to
persuade
her
mother
to
return
to
the
Mill
by
and
by
,
and
live
with
Tom
again
;
and
somehow
or
other
she
would
maintain
herself
at
St.
Ogg
's
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Kenn
would
perhaps
help
her
and
advise
her
.
<EOS>
She
remembered
his
parting
words
at
the
bazaar
.
<EOS>
She
remembered
the
momentary
feeling
of
reliance
that
had
sprung
in
her
when
he
was
talking
with
her
,
and
she
waited
with
yearning
expectation
for
the
opportunity
of
confiding
everything
to
him
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
called
every
day
at
Mr.
Deane
's
to
learn
how
Lucy
was
;
the
report
was
always
sad
,
 
nothing
had
yet
roused
her
from
the
feeble
passivity
which
had
come
on
with
the
first
shock
.
<EOS>
But
of
Philip
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
learned
nothing
;
naturally
,
no
one
whom
she
met
would
speak
to
her
about
what
related
to
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
But
at
last
she
summoned
courage
to
go
and
see
sister
Glegg
,
who
of
course
would
know
everything
,
and
had
been
even
to
see
Tom
at
the
Mill
in
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
absence
,
though
he
had
said
nothing
of
what
had
passed
on
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
her
mother
was
gone
,
Maggie
put
on
her
bonnet
.
<EOS>
She
had
resolved
on
walking
to
the
Rectory
and
asking
to
see
Dr.
Kenn
;
he
was
in
deep
grief
,
but
the
grief
of
another
does
not
jar
upon
us
in
such
circumstances
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
beyond
the
door
since
her
return
;
nevertheless
her
mind
was
so
bent
on
the
purpose
of
her
walk
,
that
the
unpleasantness
of
meeting
people
on
the
way
,
and
being
stared
at
,
did
not
occur
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
no
sooner
passed
beyond
the
narrower
streets
which
she
had
to
thread
from
Bob
's
dwelling
,
than
she
became
aware
of
unusual
glances
cast
at
her
;
and
this
consciousness
made
her
hurry
along
nervously
,
afraid
to
look
to
right
or
left
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
however
,
she
came
full
on
Mrs.
and
Miss
Turnbull
,
old
acquaintances
of
her
family
;
they
both
looked
at
her
strangely
,
and
turned
a
little
aside
without
speaking
.
<EOS>
All
hard
looks
were
pain
to
Maggie
,
but
her
self
-
reproach
was
too
strong
for
resentment
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
they
will
not
speak
to
me
<EOS>
,
she
thought
;
they
are
very
fond
of
Lucy
.
<EOS>
But
now
she
knew
that
she
was
about
to
pass
a
group
of
gentlemen
,
who
were
standing
at
the
door
of
the
billiard
-
rooms
,
and
she
could
not
help
seeing
young
Torry
step
out
a
little
with
his
glass
at
his
eye
,
and
bow
to
her
with
that
air
of
_
nonchalance
_
which
he
might
have
bestowed
on
a
friendly
barmaid
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
pride
was
too
intense
for
her
not
to
feel
that
sting
,
even
in
the
midst
of
her
sorrow
;
and
for
the
first
time
the
thought
took
strong
hold
of
her
that
she
would
have
other
obloquy
cast
on
her
besides
that
which
was
felt
to
be
due
to
her
breach
of
faith
toward
Lucy
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
at
the
Rectory
now
;
there
,
perhaps
,
she
would
find
something
else
than
retribution
.
<EOS>
Retribution
may
come
from
any
voice
;
the
hardest
,
cruelest
,
most
imbruted
urchin
at
the
street
-
corner
can
inflict
it
;
surely
help
and
pity
are
rarer
things
,
more
needful
for
the
righteous
to
bestow
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
shown
up
at
once
,
after
being
announced
,
into
Dr.
Kenn
's
study
,
where
he
sat
amongst
piled
-
up
books
,
for
which
he
had
little
appetite
,
leaning
his
cheek
against
the
head
of
his
youngest
child
,
a
girl
of
three
.
<EOS>
The
child
was
sent
away
with
the
servant
,
and
when
the
door
was
closed
,
Dr.
Kenn
said
,
placing
a
chair
for
Maggie
,
    
<EOS>
"
I
was
coming
to
see
you
,
Miss
Tulliver
;
you
have
anticipated
me
;
I
am
glad
you
did
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
looked
at
him
with
her
childlike
directness
as
she
had
done
at
the
bazaar
,
and
said
,
"
I
want
to
tell
you
everything
.
"
<EOS>
But
her
eyes
filled
fast
with
tears
as
she
said
it
,
and
all
the
pent
-
up
excitement
of
her
humiliating
walk
would
have
its
vent
before
she
could
say
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
tell
me
everything
,
"
Dr.
Kenn
said
,
with
quiet
kindness
in
his
grave
,
firm
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Think
of
me
as
one
to
whom
a
long
experience
has
been
granted
,
which
may
enable
him
to
help
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
rather
broken
sentences
,
and
with
some
effort
at
first
,
but
soon
with
the
greater
ease
that
came
from
a
sense
of
relief
in
the
confidence
,
Maggie
told
the
brief
story
of
a
struggle
that
must
be
the
beginning
of
a
long
sorrow
.
<EOS>
Only
the
day
before
,
Dr.
Kenn
had
been
made
acquainted
with
the
contents
of
Stephen
's
letter
,
and
he
had
believed
them
at
once
,
without
the
confirmation
of
Maggie
's
statement
.
<EOS>
That
involuntary
plaint
of
hers
,
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
must
go
_
,
"
had
remained
with
him
as
the
sign
that
she
was
undergoing
some
inward
conflict
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
dwelt
the
longest
on
the
feeling
which
had
made
her
come
back
to
her
mother
and
brother
,
which
made
her
cling
to
all
the
memories
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
ended
,
Dr.
Kenn
was
silent
for
some
minutes
;
there
was
a
difficulty
on
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
rose
,
and
walked
up
and
down
the
hearth
with
his
hands
behind
him
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
seated
himself
again
,
and
said
,
looking
at
Maggie
,
    
"
Your
prompting
to
go
to
your
nearest
friends
,
 
to
remain
where
all
the
ties
of
your
life
have
been
formed
,
 
is
a
true
prompting
,
to
which
the
Church
in
its
original
constitution
and
discipline
responds
,
opening
its
arms
to
the
penitent
,
watching
over
its
children
to
the
last
;
never
abandoning
them
until
they
are
hopelessly
reprobate
.
<EOS>
And
the
Church
ought
to
represent
the
feeling
of
the
community
,
so
that
every
parish
should
be
a
family
knit
together
by
Christian
brotherhood
under
a
spiritual
father
.
<EOS>
But
the
ideas
of
discipline
and
Christian
fraternity
are
entirely
relaxed
,
 
they
can
hardly
be
said
to
exist
in
the
public
mind
;
they
hardly
survive
except
in
the
partial
,
contradictory
form
they
have
taken
in
the
narrow
communities
of
schismatics
;
and
if
I
were
not
supported
by
the
firm
faith
that
the
Church
must
ultimately
recover
the
full
force
of
that
constitution
which
is
alone
fitted
to
human
needs
,
I
should
often
lose
heart
at
observing
the
want
of
fellowship
and
sense
of
mutual
responsibility
among
my
own
flock
.
<EOS>
At
present
everything
seems
tending
toward
the
relaxation
of
ties
,
 
toward
the
substitution
of
wayward
choice
for
the
adherence
to
obligation
,
which
has
its
roots
in
the
past
.
<EOS>
Your
conscience
and
your
heart
have
given
you
true
light
on
this
point
,
Miss
Tulliver
;
and
I
have
said
all
this
that
you
may
know
what
my
wish
about
you
 
what
my
advice
to
you
 
would
be
,
if
they
sprang
from
my
own
feeling
and
opinion
unmodified
by
counteracting
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Kenn
paused
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
entire
absence
of
effusive
benevolence
in
his
manner
;
there
was
something
almost
cold
in
the
gravity
of
his
look
and
voice
.
<EOS>
If
Maggie
had
not
known
that
his
benevolence
was
persevering
in
proportion
to
its
reserve
,
she
might
have
been
chilled
and
frightened
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
she
listened
expectantly
,
quite
sure
that
there
would
be
some
effective
help
in
his
words
.
<EOS>
He
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
inexperience
of
the
world
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
prevents
you
from
anticipating
fully
the
very
unjust
conceptions
that
will
probably
be
formed
concerning
your
conduct
,
 
conceptions
which
will
have
a
baneful
effect
,
even
in
spite
of
known
evidence
to
disprove
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
,
 
I
begin
to
see
,
"
said
Maggie
,
unable
to
repress
this
utterance
of
her
recent
pain
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
shall
be
insulted
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
thought
worse
than
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
perhaps
do
not
yet
know
,
"
said
Dr.
Kenn
,
with
a
touch
of
more
personal
pity
,
"
that
a
letter
is
come
which
ought
to
satisfy
every
one
who
has
known
anything
of
you
,
that
you
chose
the
steep
and
difficult
path
of
a
return
to
the
right
,
at
the
moment
when
that
return
was
most
of
all
difficult
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
where
is
he
?
"
said
poor
Maggie
,
with
a
flush
and
tremor
that
no
presence
could
have
hindered
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
gone
abroad
;
he
has
written
of
all
that
passed
to
his
father
.
<EOS>
He
has
vindicated
you
to
the
utmost
;
and
I
hope
the
communication
of
that
letter
to
your
cousin
will
have
a
beneficial
effect
on
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Kenn
waited
for
her
to
get
calm
again
before
he
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
letter
,
as
I
said
,
ought
to
suffice
to
prevent
false
impressions
concerning
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
bound
to
tell
you
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
that
not
only
the
experience
of
my
whole
life
,
but
my
observation
within
the
last
three
days
,
makes
me
fear
that
there
is
hardly
any
evidence
which
will
save
you
from
the
painful
effect
of
false
imputations
.
<EOS>
The
persons
who
are
the
most
incapable
of
a
conscientious
struggle
such
as
yours
are
precisely
those
who
will
be
likely
to
shrink
from
you
,
because
they
will
not
believe
in
your
struggle
.
<EOS>
I
fear
your
life
here
will
be
attended
not
only
with
much
pain
,
but
with
many
obstructions
.
<EOS>
For
this
reason
 
and
for
this
only
 
I
ask
you
to
consider
whether
it
will
not
perhaps
be
better
for
you
to
take
a
situation
at
a
distance
,
according
to
your
former
intention
.
<EOS>
I
will
exert
myself
at
once
to
obtain
one
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
if
I
could
but
stop
here
!
"
said
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
heart
to
begin
a
strange
life
again
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
no
stay
.
<EOS>
I
should
feel
like
a
lonely
wanderer
,
cut
off
from
the
past
.
<EOS>
I
have
written
to
the
lady
who
offered
me
a
situation
to
excuse
myself
.
<EOS>
If
I
remained
here
,
I
could
perhaps
atone
in
some
way
to
Lucy
 
to
others
;
I
could
convince
them
that
I
'm
sorry
.
<EOS>
And
,
"
she
added
,
with
some
of
the
old
proud
fire
flashing
out
,
"
I
will
not
go
away
because
people
say
false
things
of
me
.
<EOS>
They
shall
learn
to
retract
them
.
<EOS>
If
I
must
go
away
at
last
,
because
 
because
others
wish
it
,
I
will
not
go
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Dr.
Kenn
,
after
some
consideration
,
"
if
you
determine
on
that
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
you
may
rely
on
all
the
influence
my
position
gives
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
bound
to
aid
and
countenance
you
by
the
very
duties
of
my
office
as
a
parish
priest
.
<EOS>
I
will
add
,
that
personally
I
have
a
deep
interest
in
your
peace
of
mind
and
welfare
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
only
thing
I
want
is
some
occupation
that
will
enable
me
to
get
my
bread
and
be
independent
,
"
said
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
want
much
.
<EOS>
I
can
go
on
lodging
where
I
am
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
think
over
the
subject
maturely
,
"
said
Dr.
Kenn
,
"
and
in
a
few
days
I
shall
be
better
able
to
ascertain
the
general
feeling
.
<EOS>
I
shall
come
to
see
you
;
I
shall
bear
you
constantly
in
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
Maggie
had
left
him
,
Dr.
Kenn
stood
ruminating
with
his
hands
behind
him
,
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
carpet
,
under
a
painful
sense
of
doubt
and
difficulty
.
<EOS>
The
tone
of
Stephen
's
letter
,
which
he
had
read
,
and
the
actual
relations
of
all
the
persons
concerned
,
forced
upon
him
powerfully
the
idea
of
an
ultimate
marriage
between
Stephen
and
Maggie
as
the
least
evil
;
and
the
impossibility
of
their
proximity
in
St.
Ogg
's
on
any
other
supposition
,
until
after
years
of
separation
,
threw
an
insurmountable
prospective
difficulty
over
Maggie
's
stay
there
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
he
entered
with
all
the
comprehension
of
a
man
who
had
known
spiritual
conflict
,
and
lived
through
years
of
devoted
service
to
his
fellow
-
men
,
into
that
state
of
Maggie
's
heart
and
conscience
which
made
the
consent
to
the
marriage
a
desecration
to
her
;
her
conscience
must
not
be
tampered
with
;
the
principle
on
which
she
had
acted
was
a
safer
guide
than
any
balancing
of
consequences
.
<EOS>
His
experience
told
him
that
intervention
was
too
dubious
a
responsibility
to
be
lightly
incurred
;
the
possible
issue
either
of
an
endeavor
to
restore
the
former
relations
with
Lucy
and
Philip
,
or
of
counselling
submission
to
this
irruption
of
a
new
feeling
,
was
hidden
in
a
darkness
all
the
more
impenetrable
because
each
immediate
step
was
clogged
with
evil
.
  
<EOS>
The
great
problem
of
the
shifting
relation
between
passion
and
duty
is
clear
to
no
man
who
is
capable
of
apprehending
it
;
the
question
whether
the
moment
has
come
in
which
a
man
has
fallen
below
the
possibility
of
a
renunciation
that
will
carry
any
efficacy
,
and
must
accept
the
sway
of
a
passion
against
which
he
had
struggled
as
a
trespass
,
is
one
for
which
we
have
no
master
-
key
that
will
fit
all
cases
.
<EOS>
The
casuists
have
become
a
byword
of
reproach
;
but
their
perverted
spirit
of
minute
discrimination
was
the
shadow
of
a
truth
to
which
eyes
and
hearts
are
too
often
fatally
sealed
,
 
the
truth
,
that
moral
judgments
must
remain
false
and
hollow
,
unless
they
are
checked
and
enlightened
by
a
perpetual
reference
to
the
special
circumstances
that
mark
the
individual
lot
.
  
<EOS>
All
people
of
broad
,
strong
sense
have
an
instinctive
repugnance
to
the
men
of
maxims
;
because
such
people
early
discern
that
the
mysterious
complexity
of
our
life
is
not
to
be
embraced
by
maxims
,
and
that
to
lace
ourselves
up
in
formulas
of
that
sort
is
to
repress
all
the
divine
promptings
and
inspirations
that
spring
from
growing
insight
and
sympathy
.
<EOS>
And
the
man
of
maxims
is
the
popular
representative
of
the
minds
that
are
guided
in
their
moral
judgment
solely
by
general
rules
,
thinking
that
these
will
lead
them
to
justice
by
a
ready
-
made
patent
method
,
without
the
trouble
of
exerting
patience
,
discrimination
,
impartiality
,
 
without
any
care
to
assure
themselves
whether
they
have
the
insight
that
comes
from
a
hardly
earned
estimate
of
temptation
,
or
from
a
life
vivid
and
intense
enough
to
have
created
a
wide
fellow
-
feeling
with
all
that
is
human
.

That

Acquaintances

<EOS>
When
Maggie
was
at
home
again
,
her
mother
brought
her
news
of
an
unexpected
line
of
conduct
in
aunt
Glegg
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
Maggie
had
not
been
heard
of
,
Mrs.
Glegg
had
half
closed
her
shutters
and
drawn
down
her
blinds
.
<EOS>
She
felt
assured
that
Maggie
was
drowned
;
that
was
far
more
probable
than
that
her
niece
and
legatee
should
have
done
anything
to
wound
the
family
honor
in
the
tenderest
point
.
<EOS>
When
at
last
she
learned
from
Tom
that
Maggie
had
come
home
,
and
gathered
from
him
what
was
her
explanation
of
her
absence
,
she
burst
forth
in
severe
reproof
of
Tom
for
admitting
the
worst
of
his
sister
until
he
was
compelled
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
not
to
stand
by
your
"
kin
"
as
long
as
there
was
a
shred
of
honor
attributable
to
them
,
pray
what
were
you
to
stand
by
?
<EOS>
Lightly
to
admit
conduct
in
one
of
your
own
family
that
would
force
you
to
alter
your
will
,
had
never
been
the
way
of
the
Dodsons
;
and
though
Mrs.
Glegg
had
always
augured
ill
of
Maggie
's
future
at
a
time
when
other
people
were
perhaps
less
clear
-
sighted
,
yet
fair
play
was
a
jewel
,
and
it
was
not
for
her
own
friends
to
help
to
rob
the
girl
of
her
fair
fame
,
and
to
cast
her
out
from
family
shelter
to
the
scorn
of
the
outer
world
,
until
she
had
become
unequivocally
a
family
disgrace
.
<EOS>
The
circumstances
were
unprecedented
in
Mrs.
Glegg
's
experience
;
nothing
of
that
kind
had
happened
among
the
Dodsons
before
;
but
it
was
a
case
in
which
her
hereditary
rectitude
and
personal
strength
of
character
found
a
common
channel
along
with
her
fundamental
ideas
of
clanship
,
as
they
did
in
her
lifelong
regard
to
equity
in
money
matters
.
<EOS>
She
quarrelled
with
Mr.
Glegg
,
whose
kindness
,
flowing
entirely
into
compassion
for
Lucy
,
made
him
as
hard
in
his
judgment
of
Maggie
as
Mr.
Deane
himself
was
;
and
fuming
against
her
sister
Tulliver
because
she
did
not
at
once
come
to
her
for
advice
and
help
,
shut
herself
up
in
her
own
room
with
Baxter
's
"
Saints
'
Rest
"
from
morning
till
night
,
denying
herself
to
all
visitors
,
till
Mr.
Glegg
brought
from
Mr.
Deane
the
news
of
Stephen
's
letter
.
<EOS>
Then
Mrs.
Glegg
felt
that
she
had
adequate
fighting
-
ground
;
then
she
laid
aside
Baxter
,
and
was
ready
to
meet
all
comers
.
<EOS>
While
Mrs.
Pullet
could
do
nothing
but
shake
her
head
and
cry
,
and
wish
that
cousin
Abbot
had
died
,
or
any
number
of
funerals
had
happened
rather
than
this
,
which
had
never
happened
before
,
so
that
there
was
no
knowing
how
to
act
,
and
Mrs.
Pullet
could
never
enter
St.
Ogg
's
again
,
because
"
acquaintances
"
knew
of
it
all
,
Mrs.
Glegg
only
hoped
that
Mrs.
Wooll
,
or
any
one
else
,
would
come
to
her
with
their
false
tales
about
her
own
niece
,
and
she
would
know
what
to
say
to
that
ill
-
advised
person
!
  
<EOS>
Again
she
had
a
scene
of
remonstrance
with
Tom
,
all
the
more
severe
in
proportion
to
the
greater
strength
of
her
present
position
.
<EOS>
But
Tom
,
like
other
immovable
things
,
seemed
only
the
more
rigidly
fixed
under
that
attempt
to
shake
him
.
<EOS>
Poor
Tom
!
<EOS>
he
judged
by
what
he
had
been
able
to
see
;
and
the
judgment
was
painful
enough
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
thought
he
had
the
demonstration
of
facts
observed
through
years
by
his
own
eyes
,
which
gave
no
warning
of
their
imperfection
,
that
Maggie
's
nature
was
utterly
untrustworthy
,
and
too
strongly
marked
with
evil
tendencies
to
be
safely
treated
with
leniency
.
<EOS>
He
would
act
on
that
demonstration
at
any
cost
;
but
the
thought
of
it
made
his
days
bitter
to
him
.
<EOS>
Tom
,
like
every
one
of
us
,
was
imprisoned
within
the
limits
of
his
own
nature
,
and
his
education
had
simply
glided
over
him
,
leaving
a
slight
deposit
of
polish
;
if
you
are
inclined
to
be
severe
on
his
severity
,
remember
that
the
responsibility
of
tolerance
lies
with
those
who
have
the
wider
vision
.
<EOS>
There
had
arisen
in
Tom
a
repulsion
toward
Maggie
that
derived
its
very
intensity
from
their
early
childish
love
in
the
time
when
they
had
clasped
tiny
fingers
together
,
and
their
later
sense
of
nearness
in
a
common
duty
and
a
common
sorrow
;
the
sight
of
her
,
as
he
had
told
her
,
was
hateful
to
him
.
<EOS>
In
this
branch
of
the
Dodson
family
aunt
Glegg
found
a
stronger
nature
than
her
own
;
a
nature
in
which
family
feeling
had
lost
the
character
of
clanship
by
taking
on
a
doubly
deep
dye
of
personal
pride
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
allowed
that
Maggie
ought
to
be
punished
,
 
she
was
not
a
woman
to
deny
that
;
she
knew
what
conduct
was
,
 
but
punished
in
proportion
to
the
misdeeds
proved
against
her
,
not
to
those
which
were
cast
upon
her
by
people
outside
her
own
family
who
might
wish
to
show
that
their
own
kin
were
better
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
aunt
Glegg
scolded
me
so
as
niver
was
,
my
dear
,
"
said
poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
when
she
came
back
to
Maggie
,
"
as
I
did
n't
go
to
her
before
;
she
said
it
was
n't
for
her
to
come
to
me
first
.
<EOS>
But
she
spoke
like
a
sister
,
too
;
_
<EOS>
having
_
<EOS>
she
allays
was
,
and
hard
to
please
,
 
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
 
<EOS>
but
she
's
said
the
kindest
word
as
has
ever
been
spoke
by
you
yet
,
my
child
.
<EOS>
For
she
says
,
for
all
she
's
been
so
set
again
'
having
one
extry
in
the
house
,
and
making
extry
spoons
and
things
,
and
putting
her
about
in
her
ways
,
you
shall
have
a
shelter
in
her
house
,
if
you
'll
go
to
her
dutiful
,
and
she
'll
uphold
you
against
folks
as
say
harm
of
you
when
they
've
no
call
.
<EOS>
And
I
told
her
I
thought
you
could
n't
bear
to
see
anybody
but
me
<EOS>
,
you
were
so
beat
down
with
trouble
;
but
she
said
,
"
_
<EOS>
I
_
wo
n't
throw
ill
words
at
her
;
there
's
them
out
o

th
'
family
"
ull
be
ready
enough
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
give
her
good
advice
;
an
'
she
must
be
humble
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
wonderful
o
'
Jane
;
for
I
'm
sure
she
used
to
throw
everything
I
did
wrong

it
was
the
raisin

wine

turned
out
bad

it
was

"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
mother
,
"
said
poor
Maggie
,
shrinking
from
the
thought
of
all
the
contact
her
bruised
mind
would
have
to
bear
,
"
tell
her
I
'm
very
grateful
;
I
'll
go
to
see
her
as
soon
as
I
can

but
I
ca
n't
see
any
one
just

except
Dr.
Kenn

I

one

or
be

aunt
Glegg
;
I
must
get
my

bread

But
did
you
hear
nothing
of
Philip
 
Philip
Wakem

<EOS>
Have

No

This
was
the
first
lamentation
that
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
let
slip
to
Maggie
,
but
old
habit
had
been
revived
by
the
interview
with
sister
Glegg

<EOS>
"
My

poor
mother

<EOS>
Maggie
burst
out
,
cut
to
the
heart
with
pity
and
compunction
,
and
throwing
her
arms
round
her
mother

neck
;
"
I

troublesome

And

leaning

warm
young

or
three
more
days
passed
,
and
Maggie
heard
nothing
of
Philip
;
anxiety
about
him
was
becoming
her
predominant
trouble
,
and
she
summoned
courage
at
last
to
inquire
about
him
of
Dr.
Kenn
,
on
his
next
visit
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
even
know
if
Philip
was
at
home
.
<EOS>
The
elder
Wakem
was
made
moody
by
an
accumulation
of
annoyance
;
the
disappointment
in
this
young
Jetsome
,
to
whom
,
apparently
,
he
was
a
good
deal
attached
,
had
been
followed
close
by
the
catastrophe
to
his
son
's
hopes
after
he
had
done
violence
to
his
own
strong
feeling
by
conceding
to
them
,
and
had
incautiously
mentioned
this
concession
in
St.
Ogg
's
;
and
he
was
almost
fierce
in
his
brusqueness
when
any
one
asked
him
a
question
about
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
But
Philip
could
hardly
have
been
ill
,
or
it
would
have
been
known
through
the
calling
in
of
the
medical
man
;
it
was
probable
that
he
was
gone
out
of
the
town
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
Maggie
sickened
under
this
suspense
,
and
her
imagination
began
to
live
more
and
more
persistently
in
what
Philip
was
enduring
.
<EOS>
What
did
he
believe
about
her
?
  
<EOS>
At
last
Bob
brought
her
a
letter
,
without
a
postmark
,
directed
in
a
hand
which
she
knew
familiarly
in
the
letters
of
her
own
name
,
 
a
hand
in
which
her
name
had
been
written
long
ago
,
in
a
pocket
Shakespeare
which
she
possessed
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
was
in
the
room
,
and
Maggie
,
in
violent
agitation
,
hurried
upstairs
that
she
might
read
the
letter
in
solitude
.
<EOS>
She
read
it
with
a
throbbing
brow
.
    
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
 
<EOS>
I
believe
in
you
;
I
know
you
never
meant
to
deceive
me
;
I
  
know
you
tried
to
keep
faith
to
me
and
to
all
.
<EOS>
I
believed
this
  
before
I
had
any
other
evidence
of
it
than
your
own
nature
.
<EOS>
The
  
night
after
I
last
parted
from
you
I
suffered
torments
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
  
what
convinced
me
that
you
were
not
free
;
that
there
was
another
  
whose
presence
had
a
power
over
you
which
mine
never
possessed
;
but
  
through
all
the
suggestions
 
almost
murderous
suggestions
 
of
rage
  
and
jealousy
,
my
mind
made
its
way
to
believe
in
your
truthfulness
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
sure
that
you
meant
to
cleave
to
me
,
as
you
had
said
;
that
  
you
had
rejected
him
;
that
you
struggled
to
renounce
him
,
for
  
Lucy
's
sake
and
for
mine
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
see
no
issue
that
was
not
  
fatal
for
_
you
;
<EOS>
_
and
that
dread
shut
out
the
very
thought
of
  
resignation
.
<EOS>
I
foresaw
that
he
would
not
relinquish
you
,
and
I
  
believed
then
,
as
I
believe
now
,
that
the
strong
attraction
which
  
drew
you
together
proceeded
only
from
one
side
of
your
characters
,
  
and
belonged
to
that
partial
,
divided
action
of
our
nature
which
  
makes
half
the
tragedy
of
the
human
lot
.
<EOS>
I
have
felt
the
vibration
  
of
chords
in
your
nature
that
I
have
continually
felt
the
want
of
  
in
his
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
I
am
wrong
;
perhaps
I
feel
about
you
as
the
  
artist
does
about
the
scene
over
which
his
soul
has
brooded
with
  
love
;
he
would
tremble
to
see
it
confided
to
other
hands
;
he
would
  
never
believe
that
it
could
bear
for
another
all
the
meaning
and
  
the
beauty
it
bears
for
him
.
    
<EOS>
"
I
dared
not
trust
myself
to
see
you
that
morning
;
I
was
filled
  
with
selfish
passion
;
I
was
shattered
by
a
night
of
conscious
  
delirium
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
long
ago
that
I
had
never
been
resigned
even
  
to
the
mediocrity
of
my
powers
;
how
could
I
be
resigned
to
the
loss
  
of
the
one
thing
which
had
ever
come
to
me
on
earth
with
the
  
promise
of
such
deep
joy
as
would
give
a
new
and
blessed
meaning
to
  
<EOS>
the
foregoing
pain
,
 
the
promise
of
another
self
that
would
lift
my
  
aching
affection
into
the
divine
rapture
of
an
ever
-
springing
,
  
ever
-
satisfied
want
?
    
<EOS>
"
But
the
miseries
of
that
night
had
prepared
me
for
what
came
  
before
the
next
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
surprise
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
certain
that
he
  
had
prevailed
on
you
to
sacrifice
everything
to
him
,
and
I
waited
  
with
equal
certainty
to
hear
of
your
marriage
.
<EOS>
I
measured
your
love
  
and
his
by
my
own
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
wrong
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
There
is
something
  
stronger
in
you
than
your
love
for
him
.
    
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
tell
you
what
I
went
through
in
that
interval
.
<EOS>
But
even
  
in
its
utmost
agony
 
even
in
those
terrible
throes
that
love
must
  
suffer
before
it
can
be
disembodied
of
selfish
desire
 
my
love
for
  
you
sufficed
to
withhold
me
from
suicide
,
without
the
aid
of
any
  
other
motive
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
my
egoism
,
I
yet
could
not
bear
to
  
come
like
a
death
-
shadow
across
the
feast
of
your
joy
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
  
bear
to
forsake
the
world
in
which
you
still
lived
and
might
need
  
me
;
it
was
part
of
the
faith
I
had
vowed
to
you
,
 
to
wait
and
  
endure
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
that
is
a
proof
of
what
I
write
now
to
assure
you
  
of
,
 
that
no
anguish
I
have
had
to
bear
on
your
account
has
been
  
<EOS>
too
heavy
a
price
to
pay
for
the
new
life
into
which
I
have
entered
  
in
loving
you
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
put
aside
all
grief
because
of
the
  
grief
you
have
caused
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
nurtured
in
the
sense
of
privation
;
  
I
never
expected
happiness
;
and
in
knowing
you
,
in
loving
you
,
I
  
have
had
,
and
still
have
,
what
reconciles
me
to
life
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
  
to
my
affections
<EOS>
what
light
,
what
color
is
to
my
eyes
,
what
music
  
is
to
the
inward
ear
,
you
have
raised
a
dim
unrest
into
a
vivid
  
consciousness
.
<EOS>
The
new
life
I
have
found
in
caring
for
your
joy
and
  
sorrow
more
than
for
what
is
directly
my
own
,
has
transformed
the
  
spirit
of
rebellious
murmuring
into
that
willing
endurance
which
is
  
the
birth
of
strong
sympathy
.
<EOS>
I
think
nothing
but
such
complete
and
  
intense
love
could
have
initiated
me
into
that
enlarged
life
which
  
grows
and
grows
by
appropriating
the
life
of
others
;
for
before
,
I
  
was
always
dragged
back
from
it
by
ever
-
present
painful
  
self
-
consciousness
.
<EOS>
I
even
think
sometimes
that
this
gift
of
  
transferred
life
which
has
come
to
me
in
loving
you
,
may
be
a
new
  
power
to
me
.
    
<EOS>
"
Then
,
dear
one
,
in
spite
of
all
,
you
have
been
the
blessing
of
my
  
life
.
<EOS>
Let
no
self
-
reproach
weigh
on
you
because
of
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
I
who
  
should
rather
reproach
myself
for
having
urged
my
feelings
upon
  
you
,
and
hurried
you
into
words
that
you
have
felt
as
fetters
.
<EOS>
You
  
meant
to
be
true
to
those
words
;
you
_
have
_
been
true
.
<EOS>
I
can
  
measure
your
sacrifice
by
what
I
have
known
in
only
one
half
-
hour
  
of
your
presence
with
me
,
when
I
dreamed
that
you
might
love
me
  
best
.
<EOS>
But
,
Maggie
,
I
have
no
just
claim
on
you
for
more
than
  
affectionate
remembrance
.
    
<EOS>
"
For
some
time
I
have
shrunk
from
writing
to
you
,
because
I
have
  
shrunk
even
from
the
appearance
of
wishing
to
thrust
myself
before
  
you
,
and
so
repeating
my
original
error
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
not
  
misconstrue
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
we
must
keep
apart
for
a
long
while
;
  
cruel
tongues
would
force
us
apart
,
if
nothing
else
did
.
<EOS>
But
I
  
shall
not
go
away
.
<EOS>
The
place
where
you
are
is
the
one
where
my
mind
  
must
live
,
wherever
I
might
travel
.
<EOS>
And
remember
that
I
am
  
unchangeably
yours
,
 
yours
not
with
selfish
wishes
,
but
with
a
  
devotion
that
excludes
such
wishes
.
    
<EOS>
"
God
comfort
you
,
my
loving
,
large
-
souled
Maggie

<EOS>
If
every
one
else
  
has
misconceived
you
,
remember
that
you
have
never
been
doubted
by
  
him
whose
heart
recognized
you
ten
years
ago
.
    
<EOS>
"
Do
not
believe
any
one
who
says
I
am
ill
,
because
I
am
not
seen
  
out
of
doors
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
had
nervous
headaches
,
 
no
worse
than
I
  
have
sometimes
had
them
before
.
<EOS>
But
the
overpowering
heat
inclines
  
me
to
be
perfectly
quiescent
in
the
daytime
.
<EOS>
I
am
strong
enough
to
  
obey
any
word
which
shall
tell
me
that
I
can
serve
you
by
word

deed

As
Maggie
knelt
by
the
bed
sobbing
,
with
that
letter
pressed
under
her
,
her
feelings
again
and
again
gathered
themselves
in
a
whispered
cry
,
always
in
the
same
words
,
    
"
O
God

is
there
any
happiness

love
that
could
make

Maggie
and
Lucy
  
<EOS>
By
the
end
of
the
week
Dr.
Kenn
had
made
up
his
mind
that
there
was
only
one
way
in
which
he
could
secure
to
Maggie
a
suitable
living
at
St.
Ogg
's
.
<EOS>
Even
with
his
twenty
years
'
experience
as
a
parish
priest
,
he
was
aghast
at
the
obstinate
continuance
of
imputations
against
her
in
the
face
of
evidence
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
<EOS>
he
had
been
rather
more
adored
and
appealed
to
than
was
quite
agreeable
to
him
;
but
now
,
in
attempting
to
open
the
ears
of
women
to
reason
,
and
their
consciences
to
justice
,
on
behalf
of
Maggie
Tulliver
,
he
suddenly
found
himself
as
powerless
as
he
was
aware
he
would
have
been
if
he
had
attempted
to
influence
the
shape
of
bonnets
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Kenn
could
not
be
contradicted
;
he
was
listened
to
in
silence
;
but
when
he
left
the
room
,
a
comparison
of
opinions
among
his
hearers
yielded
much
the
same
result
as
before
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tulliver
had
undeniably
acted
in
a
blamable
manner
,
even
Dr.
Kenn
did
not
deny
that
;
how
,
then
,
could
he
think
so
lightly
of
her
as
to
put
that
favorable
interpretation
on
everything
she
had
done
?
<EOS>
Even
on
the
supposition
that
required
the
utmost
stretch
of
belief
,
 
namely
,
that
none
of
the
things
said
about
Miss
Tulliver
were
true
,
 
still
,
since
they
_
had
_
been
said
about
her
,
they
had
cast
an
odor
round
her
which
must
cause
her
to
be
shrunk
from
by
every
woman
who
had
to
take
care
of
her
own
reputation
 
and
of
Society
.
<EOS>
To
have
taken
Maggie
by
the
hand
and
said
,
"
I
will
not
believe
unproved
evil
of
you
;
my
lips
shall
not
utter
it
;
my
ears
shall
be
closed
against
it
;
I
,
too
,
am
an
erring
mortal
,
liable
to
stumble
,
apt
to
come
short
of
my
most
earnest
efforts
;
your
lot
has
been
harder
than
mine
,
your
temptation
greater
<EOS>
;
let
us
help
each
other
to
stand
and
walk
without
more
falling
,
"
 
to
have
done
this
would
have
demanded
courage
,
deep
pity
,
self
-
knowledge
,
generous
trust
;
would
have
demanded
a
mind
that
tasted
no
piquancy
in
evil
-
speaking
,
that
felt
no
self
-
exaltation
in
condemning
,
that
cheated
itself
with
no
large
words
into
the
belief
that
life
can
have
any
moral
end
,
any
high
religion
,
which
excludes
the
striving
after
perfect
truth
,
justice
,
and
love
toward
the
individual
men
and
women
who
come
across
our
own
path
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
of
St.
Ogg
's
were
not
beguiled
by
any
wide
speculative
conceptions
;
but
they
had
their
favorite
abstraction
,
called
Society
,
which
served
to
make
their
consciences
perfectly
easy
in
doing
what
satisfied
their
own
egoism
,
 
thinking
and
speaking
the
worst
of
Maggie
Tulliver
,
and
turning
their
backs
upon
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
naturally
disappointing
to
Dr.
Kenn
,
after
two
years
of
superfluous
incense
from
his
feminine
parishioners
,
to
find
them
suddenly
maintaining
their
views
in
opposition
to
his
;
but
then
they
maintained
them
in
opposition
to
a
higher
Authority
,
which
they
had
venerated
longer
.
<EOS>
That
Authority
had
furnished
a
very
explicit
answer
to
persons
who
might
inquire
where
their
social
duties
began
,
and
might
be
inclined
to
take
wide
views
as
to
the
starting
-
point
.
<EOS>
The
answer
had
not
turned
on
the
ultimate
good
of
Society
,
but
on
"
a
certain
man
"
who
was
found
in
trouble
by
the
wayside
.
  
<EOS>
Not
that
St.
Ogg
's
was
empty
of
women
with
some
tenderness
of
heart
and
conscience
;
probably
it
had
as
fair
<EOS>
a
proportion
of
human
goodness
in
it
as
any
other
small
trading
town
of
that
day
.
<EOS>
But
until
every
good
man
is
brave
,
we
must
expect
to
find
many
good
women
timid
,
 
too
timid
even
to
believe
in
the
correctness
of
their
own
best
promptings
,
when
these
would
place
them
in
a
minority
.
<EOS>
And
the
men
at
St.
Ogg
's
were
not
all
brave
,
by
any
means
;
some
of
them
were
even
fond
of
scandal
,
and
to
an
extent
that
might
have
given
their
conversation
an
effeminate
character
,
if
it
had
not
been
distinguished
by
masculine
jokes
,
and
by
an
occasional
shrug
of
the
shoulders
at
the
mutual
hatred
of
women
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
general
feeling
of
the
masculine
mind
at
St.
Ogg
's
that
women
were
not
to
be
interfered
with
in
their
treatment
of
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
And
thus
every
direction
in
which
Dr.
Kenn
had
turned
,
in
the
hope
of
procuring
some
kind
recognition
and
some
employment
for
Maggie
,
proved
a
disappointment
to
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
James
Torry
could
not
think
of
taking
Maggie
as
a
nursery
governess
,
even
temporarily
,
 
a
young
woman
about
whom
"
such
things
had
been
said
,
"
and
about
whom
"
gentlemen
joked
"
;
and
Miss
Kirke
,
who
had
a
spinal
complaint
,
and
wanted
a
reader
and
companion
,
felt
quite
sure
that
Maggie
's
mind
must
be
of
a
quality
with
which
she
,
for
her
part
,
could
not
risk
_
any
_
contact
.
<EOS>
Why
did
not
Miss
Tulliver
accept
the
shelter
offered
her
by
her
aunt
Glegg
?
<EOS>
It
did
not
become
a
girl
like
her
to
refuse
it
.
<EOS>
Or
else
,
why
did
she
not
go
out
of
the
neighborhood
,
and
get
a
situation
where
she
was
not
known
?
<EOS>
(
It
was
not
,
apparently
,
of
so
much
importance
that
she
should
carry
her
dangerous
tendencies
into
strange
families
unknown
at
St.
Ogg
's
.
)
<EOS>
She
must
be
very
bold
and
hardened
to
wish
to
stay
in
a
parish
where
she
was
so
much
stared
at
and
whispered
about
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Kenn
,
having
great
natural
firmness
,
began
,
in
the
presence
of
this
opposition
,
as
every
firm
man
would
have
done
,
to
contract
a
certain
strength
of
determination
over
and
above
what
would
have
been
called
forth
by
the
end
in
view
.
<EOS>
He
himself
wanted
a
daily
governess
for
his
younger
children
;
and
though
he
had
hesitated
in
the
first
instance
to
offer
this
position
to
Maggie
,
the
resolution
to
protest
with
the
utmost
force
of
his
personal
and
priestly
character
against
her
being
crushed
and
driven
away
by
slander
,
was
now
decisive
.
<EOS>
Maggie
gratefully
accepted
an
employment
that
gave
her
duties
as
well
as
a
support
;
her
days
would
be
filled
now
,
and
solitary
evenings
would
be
a
welcome
rest
.
<EOS>
She
no
longer
needed
the
sacrifice
her
mother
made
in
staying
with
her
,
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
persuaded
to
go
back
to
the
Mill
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
it
began
to
be
discovered
that
Dr.
Kenn
,
exemplary
as
he
had
hitherto
appeared
,
had
his
crotchets
,
possibly
his
weaknesses
.
<EOS>
The
masculine
mind
of
St.
Ogg
's
smiled
pleasantly
,
and
did
not
wonder
that
Kenn
liked
to
see
a
fine
pair
of
eyes
daily
,
or
that
he
was
inclined
to
take
so
lenient
a
view
of
the
past
;
the
feminine
mind
,
regarded
at
that
period
as
less
powerful
,
took
a
more
melancholy
view
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
If
Dr.
Kenn
should
be
beguiled
into
marrying
that
Miss
Tulliver
!
<EOS>
It
was
not
safe
to
be
too
confident
,
even
about
the
best
of
men
;
an
apostle
had
fallen
,
and
wept
bitterly
afterwards
;
and
though
Peter
's
denial
was
not
a
close
precedent
,
his
repentance
was
likely
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
had
not
taken
her
daily
walks
to
the
Rectory
for
many
weeks
,
before
the
dreadful
possibility
of
her
some
time
or
other
becoming
the
Rector
's
wife
had
been
talked
of
so
often
in
confidence
,
that
ladies
were
beginning
to
discuss
how
they
should
behave
to
her
in
that
position
.
<EOS>
For
Dr.
Kenn
,
it
had
been
understood
,
had
sat
in
the
schoolroom
half
an
hour
one
morning
,
when
Miss
Tulliver
was
giving
her
lessons
,
 
nay
,
he
had
sat
there
every
morning
;
he
had
once
walked
home
with
her
,
 
he
<EOS>
almost
_
<EOS>
always
_
walked
home
with
her
,
 
and
if
not
,
he
went
to
see
her
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
What
an
artful
creature
she
was
!
<EOS>
What
a
_
mother
_
for
those
children
!
<EOS>
It
was
enough
to
make
poor
Mrs.
Kenn
turn
in
her
grave
,
that
they
should
be
put
under
the
care
of
this
girl
only
a
few
weeks
after
her
death
.
<EOS>
Would
he
be
so
lost
to
propriety
as
to
marry
her
before
the
year
was
out
?
<EOS>
The
masculine
mind
was
sarcastic
,
and
thought
_
not
_
.
  
<EOS>
The
Miss
Guests
saw
an
alleviation
to
the
sorrow
of
witnessing
a
folly
in
their
Rector
;
at
least
their
brother
would
be
safe
;
and
their
knowledge
of
Stephen
's
tenacity
was
a
constant
ground
of
alarm
to
them
,
lest
he
should
come
back
and
marry
Maggie
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
among
those
who
disbelieved
their
brother
's
letter
;
but
they
had
no
confidence
in
Maggie
's
adherence
to
her
renunciation
of
him
;
they
suspected
that
she
had
shrunk
rather
from
the
elopement
than
from
the
marriage
,
and
that
she
lingered
in
St.
Ogg
's
,
relying
on
his
return
to
her
.
<EOS>
They
had
always
thought
her
disagreeable
;
they
now
thought
her
artful
and
proud
;
having
quite
as
good
grounds
for
that
judgment
as
you
and
I
probably
have
for
many
strong
opinions
of
the
same
kind
.
<EOS>
Formerly
they
had
not
altogether
delighted
in
the
contemplated
match
with
Lucy
,
but
now
their
dread
of
a
marriage
between
Stephen
and
Maggie
added
its
momentum
to
their
genuine
pity
and
indignation
on
behalf
of
the
gentle
forsaken
girl
,
in
making
them
desire
that
he
should
return
to
her
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Lucy
was
able
to
leave
home
,
she
was
to
seek
relief
from
the
oppressive
heat
of
this
August
by
going
to
the
coast
with
the
Miss
Guests
;
and
it
was
in
their
plans
that
Stephen
should
be
induced
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
On
the
very
first
hint
of
gossip
concerning
Maggie
and
Dr.
Kenn
,
the
report
was
conveyed
in
Miss
Guest
's
letter
to
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
had
frequent
tidings
through
her
mother
,
or
aunt
Glegg
,
or
Dr.
Kenn
,
of
Lucy
's
gradual
progress
toward
recovery
,
and
her
thoughts
tended
continually
toward
her
uncle
Deane
's
house
;
she
hungered
for
an
interview
with
Lucy
,
if
it
were
only
for
five
minutes
,
to
utter
a
word
of
penitence
,
to
be
assured
by
Lucy
's
own
eyes
and
lips
that
she
did
not
believe
in
the
willing
treachery
of
those
whom
she
had
loved
and
trusted
.
<EOS>
But
she
knew
that
even
if
her
uncle
's
indignation
had
not
closed
his
house
against
her
,
the
agitation
of
such
an
interview
would
have
been
forbidden
to
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Only
to
have
seen
her
without
speaking
would
have
been
some
relief
;
for
Maggie
was
haunted
by
a
face
cruel
in
its
very
gentleness
;
a
face
that
had
been
turned
on
hers
with
glad
,
sweet
looks
of
trust
and
love
from
the
twilight
time
of
memory
;
changed
now
to
a
sad
and
weary
face
by
a
first
heart
-
stroke
.
<EOS>
And
as
the
days
passed
on
,
that
pale
image
became
more
and
more
distinct
;
the
picture
grew
and
grew
into
more
speaking
definiteness
under
the
avenging
hand
of
remorse
;
the
soft
hazel
eyes
,
in
their
look
of
pain
,
were
bent
forever
on
Maggie
,
and
pierced
her
the
more
because
she
could
see
no
anger
in
them
.
<EOS>
But
Lucy
was
not
yet
able
to
go
to
church
,
or
any
place
where
Maggie
could
see
her
;
and
even
the
hope
of
that
departed
,
when
the
news
was
told
her
by
aunt
Glegg
,
that
Lucy
was
really
going
away
in
a
few
days
to
Scarborough
with
the
Miss
Guests
,
who
had
been
heard
to
say
that
they
expected
their
brother
to
meet
them
there
.
  
<EOS>
Only
those
who
have
known
what
hardest
inward
conflict
is
,
can
know
what
Maggie
felt
as
she
sat
in
her
loneliness
the
evening
after
hearing
that
news
from
Mrs.
Glegg
,
 
only
those
who
have
known
what
it
is
to
dread
their
own
selfish
desires
as
the
watching
mother
would
dread
the
sleeping
-
potion
that
was
to
still
her
own
pain
.
  
<EOS>
She
sat
without
candle
in
the
twilight
,
with
the
window
wide
open
toward
the
river
;
the
sense
of
oppressive
heat
adding
itself
undistinguishably
to
the
burthen
of
her
lot
.
<EOS>
Seated
on
a
chair
against
the
window
,
with
her
arm
on
the
windowsill
she
was
looking
blankly
at
the
flowing
river
,
swift
with
the
backward
-
rushing
tide
,
struggling
to
see
still
the
sweet
face
in
its
unreproaching
sadness
,
that
seemed
now
from
moment
to
moment
to
sink
away
and
be
hidden
behind
a
form
that
thrust
itself
between
,
and
made
darkness
.
<EOS>
Hearing
the
door
open
,
she
thought
Mrs.
Jakin
was
coming
in
with
her
supper
,
as
usual
;
and
with
that
repugnance
to
trivial
speech
which
comes
with
languor
and
wretchedness
,
she
shrank
from
turning
round
and
saying
she
wanted
nothing
;
good
little
Mrs.
Jakin
would
be
sure
to
make
some
well
-
meant
remarks
.
<EOS>
But
the
next
moment
,
without
her
having
discerned
the
sound
of
a
footstep
,
she
felt
a
light
hand
on
her
shoulder
,
and
heard
a
voice
close
to
her
saying
,
"
Maggie
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
face
was
there
,
 
changed
,
but
all
the
sweeter
;
the
hazel
eyes
were
there
,
with
their
heart
-
piercing
tenderness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
!
"
<EOS>
the
soft
voice
said
.
<EOS>
"
Lucy
!
"
answered
a
voice
with
a
sharp
ring
of
anguish
in
it
;
and
Lucy
threw
her
arms
round
Maggie
's
neck
,
and
leaned
her
pale
cheek
against
the
burning
brow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
stole
out
,
"
said
Lucy
,
almost
in
a
whisper
,
while
she
sat
down
close
to
Maggie
and
held
her
hand
,
"
when
papa
and
the
rest
were
away
.
<EOS>
Alice
is
come
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
asked
her
to
help
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
only
stay
a
little
while
,
because
it
is
so
late
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
easier
to
say
that
at
first
than
to
say
anything
else
.
<EOS>
They
sat
looking
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
the
interview
must
end
without
more
speech
,
for
speech
was
very
difficult
.
<EOS>
Each
felt
that
there
would
be
something
scorching
in
the
words
that
would
recall
the
irretrievable
wrong
.
<EOS>
But
soon
,
as
Maggie
looked
,
every
distinct
thought
began
to
be
overflowed
by
a
wave
of
loving
penitence
,
and
words
burst
forth
with
a
sob
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
for
coming
,
Lucy
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
sobs
came
thick
on
each
other
after
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
dear
,
be
comforted
,
"
said
Lucy
now
,
putting
her
cheek
against
Maggie
's
again
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
grieve
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
sat
still
,
hoping
to
soothe
Maggie
with
that
gentle
caress
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
mean
to
deceive
you
,
Lucy
,
"
said
Maggie
,
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
.
<EOS>
"
It
always
made
me
wretched
that
I
felt
what
I
did
n't
like
you
to
know
.
<EOS>
It
was
because
I
thought
it
would
all
be
conquered
,
and
you
might
never
see
anything
to
wound
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
dear
,
"
said
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
never
meant
to
make
me
unhappy
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
trouble
that
has
come
on
us
all
;
you
have
more
to
bear
than
I
have
 
<EOS>
and
you
gave
him
up
,
when
 
you
did
what
it
must
have
been
very
hard
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
silent
again
a
little
while
,
sitting
with
clasped
hands
,
and
cheeks
leaned
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
,
"
Maggie
began
again
,
"
_
he
_
struggled
too
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
to
be
true
to
you
.
<EOS>
He
will
come
back
to
you
.
<EOS>
Forgive
him
 
he
will
be
happy
then
   
"
  
<EOS>
These
words
were
wrung
forth
from
Maggie
's
deepest
soul
,
with
an
effort
like
the
convulsed
clutch
of
a
drowning
man
.
<EOS>
Lucy
trembled
and
was
silent
.
  
<EOS>
A
gentle
knock
came
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
was
Alice
,
the
maid
,
who
entered
and
said
,
    
"
I
dare
n't
stay
any
longer
,
Miss
Deane
.
<EOS>
They
'll
find
it
out
,
and
there
'll
be
such
anger
at
your
coming
out
so
late
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
rose
and
said
,
"
<EOS>
Very
well
,
Alice
,
 
in
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
to
go
away
on
Friday
,
Maggie
,
"
she
added
,
when
Alice
had
closed
the
door
again
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
come
back
,
and
am
strong
,
they
will
let
me
do
as
I
like
.
<EOS>
I
shall
come
to
you
when
I
please
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lucy
,
"
said
Maggie
,
with
another
great
effort
,
"
I
pray
to
God
continually
that
I
may
never
be
the
cause
of
sorrow
to
you
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
pressed
the
little
hand
that
she
held
between
hers
,
and
looked
up
into
the
face
that
was
bent
over
hers
.
<EOS>
Lucy
never
forgot
that
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
low
voice
,
that
had
the
solemnity
of
confession
in
it
,
"
you
are
better
than
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
   
"
  
<EOS>
She
broke
off
there
,
and
said
no
more
.
<EOS>
But
they
clasped
each
other
again
in
a
last
embrace
.
    
<EOS>
The
Last
Conflict
  
<EOS>
In
the
second
week
of
September
,
Maggie
was
again
sitting
in
her
lonely
room
,
battling
with
the
old
shadowy
enemies
that
were
forever
slain
and
rising
again
.
<EOS>
It
was
past
midnight
,
and
the
rain
was
beating
heavily
against
the
window
,
driven
with
fitful
force
by
the
rushing
,
loud
-
moaning
wind
.
<EOS>
For
the
day
after
Lucy
's
visit
there
had
been
a
sudden
change
in
the
weather
;
the
heat
and
drought
had
given
way
to
cold
variable
winds
,
and
heavy
falls
of
rain
at
intervals
;
and
she
had
been
forbidden
to
risk
the
contemplated
journey
until
the
weather
should
become
more
settled
.
<EOS>
In
the
counties
higher
up
the
Floss
<EOS>
the
rains
had
been
continuous
,
and
the
completion
of
the
harvest
had
been
arrested
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
for
the
last
two
days
,
the
rains
on
this
lower
course
of
the
river
had
been
incessant
,
so
that
the
old
men
had
shaken
their
heads
and
talked
of
sixty
years
ago
,
when
the
same
sort
of
weather
,
happening
about
the
equinox
,
brought
on
the
great
floods
,
which
swept
the
bridge
away
,
and
reduced
the
town
to
great
misery
.
<EOS>
But
the
younger
generation
,
who
had
seen
several
small
floods
,
thought
lightly
of
these
sombre
recollections
and
forebodings
;
and
Bob
Jakin
,
naturally
prone
to
take
a
hopeful
view
of
his
own
luck
,
laughed
at
his
mother
when
she
regretted
their
having
taken
a
house
by
the
riverside
,
observing
that
<EOS>
but
for
that
they
would
have
had
no
boats
,
which
were
the
most
lucky
of
possessions
in
case
of
a
flood
that
obliged
them
to
go
to
a
distance
for
food
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
careless
and
the
fearful
were
alike
sleeping
in
their
beds
now
.
<EOS>
There
was
hope
that
the
rain
would
abate
by
the
morrow
;
threatenings
of
a
worse
kind
,
from
sudden
thaws
after
falls
of
snow
,
had
often
passed
off
,
in
the
experience
of
the
younger
ones
;
and
at
the
very
worst
,
the
banks
would
be
sure
to
break
lower
down
the
river
when
the
tide
came
in
with
violence
,
and
so
the
waters
would
be
carried
off
,
without
causing
more
than
temporary
inconvenience
,
and
losses
that
would
be
felt
only
by
the
poorer
sort
,
whom
charity
would
relieve
.
  
<EOS>
All
were
in
their
beds
now
,
for
it
was
past
midnight
;
all
except
some
solitary
watchers
such
as
Maggie
.
<EOS>
She
was
seated
in
her
little
parlor
toward
the
river
,
with
one
candle
,
that
left
everything
dim
in
the
room
except
a
letter
which
lay
before
her
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
That
letter
,
which
had
come
to
her
to
-
day
,
was
one
of
the
causes
that
had
kept
her
up
far
on
into
the
night
,
unconscious
how
the
hours
were
going
,
careless
of
seeking
rest
,
with
no
image
of
rest
coming
across
her
mind
,
except
of
that
far
,
far
off
rest
from
which
there
would
be
no
more
waking
for
her
into
this
struggling
earthly
life
.
  
<EOS>
Two
days
before
Maggie
received
that
letter
,
she
had
been
to
the
Rectory
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
The
heavy
rain
would
have
prevented
her
from
going
since
;
but
there
was
another
reason
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Kenn
,
at
first
enlightened
only
by
a
few
hints
as
to
the
new
turn
which
gossip
and
slander
had
taken
in
relation
to
Maggie
,
had
recently
been
made
more
fully
aware
of
it
by
an
earnest
remonstrance
from
one
of
his
male
parishioners
against
the
indiscretion
of
persisting
in
the
attempt
to
overcome
the
prevalent
feeling
in
the
parish
by
a
course
of
resistance
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Kenn
,
having
a
conscience
void
of
offence
in
the
matter
,
was
still
inclined
to
persevere
,
 
was
still
averse
to
give
way
before
a
public
sentiment
that
was
odious
and
contemptible
;
but
he
was
finally
wrought
upon
by
the
consideration
of
the
peculiar
responsibility
attached
to
his
office
,
of
avoiding
the
appearance
of
evil
,
 
an
"
appearance
"
that
is
always
dependent
on
the
average
quality
of
surrounding
minds
.
<EOS>
Where
these
minds
are
low
and
gross
,
the
area
of
that
"
appearance
"
is
proportionately
widened
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
was
in
danger
of
acting
from
obstinacy
;
perhaps
it
was
his
duty
to
succumb
.
<EOS>
Conscientious
people
are
apt
to
see
their
duty
in
that
which
is
the
most
painful
course
;
and
to
recede
was
always
painful
to
Dr.
Kenn
.
<EOS>
He
made
up
his
mind
that
he
must
advise
Maggie
to
go
away
from
St.
Ogg
's
for
a
time
;
and
he
performed
that
difficult
task
with
as
much
delicacy
as
he
could
,
only
stating
in
vague
terms
that
he
found
his
attempt
to
countenance
her
stay
was
a
source
of
discord
between
himself
and
his
parishioners
,
that
was
likely
to
obstruct
his
usefulness
as
a
clergyman
.
<EOS>
He
begged
her
to
allow
him
to
write
to
a
clerical
friend
of
his
,
who
might
possibly
take
her
into
his
own
family
as
governess
;
and
,
if
not
,
would
probably
know
of
some
other
available
position
for
a
young
woman
in
whose
welfare
Dr.
Kenn
felt
a
strong
interest
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Maggie
listened
with
a
trembling
lip
;
she
could
say
nothing
but
a
faint
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
I
shall
be
grateful
"
;
and
she
walked
back
to
her
lodgings
,
through
the
driving
rain
,
with
a
new
sense
of
desolation
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
a
lonely
wanderer
;
she
must
go
out
among
fresh
faces
,
that
would
look
at
her
wonderingly
,
because
the
days
did
not
seem
joyful
to
her
;
she
must
begin
a
new
life
,
in
which
she
would
have
to
rouse
herself
to
receive
new
impressions
;
and
she
was
so
unspeakably
,
sickeningly
weary
!
<EOS>
There
was
no
home
,
no
help
for
the
erring
;
even
those
who
pitied
were
constrained
to
hardness
.
<EOS>
But
ought
she
to
complain
?
<EOS>
Ought
she
to
shrink
in
this
way
from
the
long
penance
of
life
,
which
was
all
the
possibility
she
had
of
lightening
the
load
to
some
other
sufferers
,
and
so
changing
that
passionate
error
into
a
new
force
of
unselfish
human
love
?
<EOS>
All
the
next
day
she
sat
in
her
lonely
room
,
with
a
window
darkened
by
the
cloud
and
the
driving
rain
,
thinking
of
that
future
,
and
wrestling
for
patience
;
for
what
repose
could
poor
Maggie
ever
win
except
by
wrestling
?
  
<EOS>
And
on
the
third
day
 
this
day
of
which
she
had
just
sat
out
the
close
 
<EOS>
the
letter
had
come
which
was
lying
on
the
table
before
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
letter
was
from
Stephen
.
<EOS>
He
was
come
back
from
Holland
;
he
was
at
Mudport
again
,
unknown
to
any
of
his
friends
,
and
had
written
to
her
from
that
place
,
enclosing
the
letter
to
a
person
whom
he
trusted
in
St.
Ogg
's
.
<EOS>
From
beginning
to
end
it
was
a
passionate
cry
of
reproach
;
an
appeal
against
her
useless
sacrifice
of
him
,
of
herself
,
against
that
perverted
notion
of
right
which
led
her
to
crush
all
his
hopes
,
for
the
sake
of
a
mere
idea
,
and
not
any
substantial
good
,
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
his
_
hopes
,
whom
she
loved
,
and
who
loved
her
with
that
single
overpowering
passion
,
that
worship
,
which
a
man
never
gives
to
a
woman
more
than
once
in
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
written
to
me
that
you
are
to
marry
Kenn
.
<EOS>
As
if
I
should
believe
that
!
<EOS>
Perhaps
they
have
told
you
some
such
fables
about
me
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
they
tell
you
I
've
been
"
travelling
.
<EOS>
"
My
body
has
been
dragged
about
somewhere
;
but
_
I
_
have
never
travelled
from
the
hideous
place
where
you
left
me
;
where
I
started
up
from
the
stupor
of
helpless
rage
to
find
you
gone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
!
<EOS>
whose
pain
can
have
been
like
mine
?
<EOS>
Whose
injury
is
like
mine
?
<EOS>
Who
besides
me
has
met
that
long
look
of
love
that
has
burnt
itself
into
my
soul
,
so
that
no
other
image
can
come
there
?
<EOS>
Maggie
,
call
me
back
to
you
!
<EOS>
Call
me
back
to
life
and
goodness
!
<EOS>
I
am
banished
from
both
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
motives
;
I
am
indifferent
to
everything
.
<EOS>
Two
months
have
only
deepened
the
certainty
that
I
can
never
care
for
life
without
you
.
<EOS>
Write
me
one
word
;
say
"
Come
!
"
<EOS>
In
two
days
I
should
be
with
you
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
have
you
forgotten
what
it
was
to
be
together
,
 
to
be
within
reach
of
a
look
,
to
be
within
hearing
of
each
other
's
voice
?
"
  
<EOS>
When
Maggie
first
read
this
letter
she
felt
as
if
her
real
temptation
had
only
just
begun
.
<EOS>
At
the
entrance
of
the
chill
dark
cavern
,
we
turn
with
unworn
courage
from
the
warm
light
;
but
how
,
when
we
have
trodden
far
in
the
damp
darkness
,
and
have
begun
to
be
faint
and
weary
;
how
,
if
there
is
a
sudden
opening
above
us
,
and
we
are
invited
back
again
to
the
life
-
nourishing
day
?
<EOS>
The
leap
of
natural
longing
from
under
the
pressure
of
pain
is
so
strong
,
that
all
less
immediate
motives
are
likely
to
be
forgotten
 
till
the
pain
has
been
escaped
from
.
  
<EOS>
For
hours
Maggie
felt
as
if
her
struggle
had
been
in
vain
.
<EOS>
For
hours
every
other
thought
that
she
strove
to
summon
was
thrust
aside
by
the
image
of
Stephen
waiting
for
the
single
word
that
would
bring
him
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
_
read
_
<EOS>
the
letter
<EOS>
:
she
heard
him
uttering
it
,
and
the
voice
shook
her
with
its
old
strange
power
.
<EOS>
All
the
day
before
she
had
been
filled
with
the
vision
of
a
lonely
future
through
which
she
must
carry
the
burthen
of
regret
,
upheld
only
by
clinging
faith
.
<EOS>
And
here
,
close
within
her
reach
,
urging
itself
upon
her
even
as
a
claim
,
was
another
future
,
in
which
hard
endurance
and
effort
were
to
be
exchanged
for
easy
,
delicious
leaning
on
another
's
loving
strength
!
<EOS>
And
yet
that
promise
of
joy
in
the
place
of
sadness
did
not
make
the
dire
force
of
the
temptation
to
Maggie
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
Stephen
's
tone
of
misery
,
it
was
the
doubt
in
the
justice
of
her
own
resolve
,
that
made
the
balance
tremble
,
and
made
her
once
start
from
her
seat
to
reach
the
pen
and
paper
,
and
write
"
Come
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
close
upon
that
decisive
act
,
her
mind
recoiled
;
and
the
sense
of
contradiction
with
her
past
self
in
her
moments
of
strength
and
clearness
came
upon
her
like
a
pang
of
conscious
degradation
.
<EOS>
No
,
she
must
wait
;
she
must
pray
;
the
light
that
had
forsaken
her
would
come
again
;
she
should
feel
again
what
she
had
felt
when
she
had
fled
away
,
under
an
inspiration
strong
enough
to
conquer
agony
,
 
to
conquer
love
;
she
should
feel
again
what
she
had
felt
when
Lucy
stood
by
her
,
when
Philip
's
letter
had
stirred
all
the
fibres
that
bound
her
to
the
calmer
past
.
  
<EOS>
She
sat
quite
still
,
far
on
into
the
night
,
with
no
impulse
to
change
her
attitude
,
without
active
force
enough
even
for
the
mental
act
of
prayer
;
only
waiting
for
the
light
that
would
surely
come
again
.
<EOS>
It
came
with
the
memories
that
no
passion
could
long
quench
;
the
long
past
came
back
to
her
,
and
with
it
the
fountains
of
self
-
renouncing
pity
and
affection
,
of
faithfulness
and
resolve
.
<EOS>
The
words
that
were
marked
by
the
quiet
hand
in
the
little
old
book
that
she
had
long
ago
learned
by
heart
,
rushed
even
to
her
lips
,
and
found
a
vent
for
themselves
in
a
low
murmur
that
was
quite
lost
in
the
loud
driving
of
the
rain
against
the
window
and
the
loud
moan
and
roar
of
the
wind
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
received
the
Cross
,
I
have
received
it
from
Thy
hand
;
I
will
bear
it
,
and
bear
it
till
death
,
as
Thou
hast
laid
it
upon
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
soon
other
words
rose
that
could
find
no
utterance
but
in
a
sob
,
 
"
Forgive
me
,
Stephen
!
<EOS>
It
will
pass
away
.
<EOS>
You
will
come
back
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
took
up
the
letter
,
held
it
to
the
candle
,
and
let
it
burn
slowly
on
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
she
would
write
to
him
the
last
word
of
parting
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
bear
it
,
and
bear
it
till
death
.
<EOS>
But
how
long
it
will
be
before
death
comes
!
<EOS>
I
am
so
young
,
so
healthy
.
<EOS>
How
shall
I
have
patience
and
strength
?
<EOS>
Am
I
to
struggle
and
fall
and
repent
again
?
<EOS>
Has
life
other
trials
as
hard
for
me
still
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
cry
of
self
-
despair
,
Maggie
fell
on
her
knees
against
the
table
,
and
buried
her
sorrow
-
stricken
face
.
<EOS>
Her
soul
went
out
to
the
Unseen
Pity
that
would
be
with
her
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
Surely
there
was
something
being
taught
her
by
this
experience
of
great
need
;
and
she
must
be
learning
a
secret
of
human
tenderness
and
long
-
suffering
,
that
the
less
erring
could
hardly
know
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
O
God
,
if
my
life
is
to
be
long
,
let
me
live
to
bless
and
comfort
   
<EOS>
"
  
At
that
moment
Maggie
felt
a
startling
sensation
of
sudden
cold
about
her
knees
and
feet
;
it
was
water
flowing
under
her
.
<EOS>
She
started
up
;
the
stream
was
flowing
under
the
door
that
led
into
the
passage
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
bewildered
for
an
instant
;
she
knew
it
was
the
flood
!
  
<EOS>
The
tumult
of
emotion
she
had
been
enduring
for
the
last
twelve
hours
seemed
to
have
left
a
great
calm
in
her
;
without
screaming
,
she
hurried
with
the
candle
upstairs
to
Bob
Jakin
's
bedroom
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
ajar
;
she
went
in
and
shook
him
by
the
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bob
,
the
flood
is
come
!
<EOS>
it
is
in
the
house
;
let
us
see
if
we
can
make
the
boats
safe
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
lighted
his
candle
,
while
the
poor
wife
,
snatching
up
her
baby
,
burst
into
screams
;
and
then
she
hurried
down
again
to
see
if
the
waters
were
rising
fast
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
step
down
into
the
room
at
the
door
leading
from
the
staircase
;
she
saw
that
the
water
was
already
on
a
level
with
the
step
.
<EOS>
While
she
was
looking
,
something
came
with
a
tremendous
crash
against
the
window
,
and
sent
the
leaded
panes
and
the
old
wooden
framework
inward
in
shivers
,
the
water
pouring
in
after
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
boat
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
Bob
,
come
down
to
get
the
boats
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
without
a
moment
's
shudder
of
fear
,
she
plunged
through
the
water
,
which
was
rising
fast
to
her
knees
,
and
by
the
glimmering
light
of
the
candle
she
had
left
on
the
stairs
,
she
mounted
on
to
the
window
-
sill
,
and
crept
into
the
boat
,
which
was
left
with
the
prow
lodging
and
protruding
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
Bob
was
not
long
after
her
,
hurrying
without
shoes
or
stockings
,
but
with
the
lanthorn
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
they
're
both
here
,
 
both
the
boats
,
"
said
Bob
,
as
he
got
into
the
one
where
Maggie
was
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
wonderful
<EOS>
this
fastening
is
n't
broke
too
,
as
well
as
the
mooring
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
excitement
of
getting
into
the
other
boat
,
unfastening
it
,
and
mastering
an
oar
,
Bob
was
not
struck
with
the
danger
Maggie
incurred
.
<EOS>
We
are
not
apt
to
fear
for
the
fearless
,
when
we
are
companions
in
their
danger
,
and
Bob
's
mind
was
absorbed
in
possible
expedients
for
the
safety
of
the
helpless
indoors
.
<EOS>
The
fact
that
Maggie
had
been
up
,
had
waked
him
,
and
had
taken
the
lead
in
activity
,
gave
Bob
a
vague
impression
of
her
as
one
who
would
help
to
protect
,
not
need
to
be
protected
.
<EOS>
She
too
had
got
possession
of
an
oar
,
and
had
pushed
off
,
so
as
to
release
the
boat
from
the
overhanging
window
-
frame
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
water
's
rising
so
fast
,
"
said
Bob
,
"
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
'll
be
in
at
the
chambers
before
long
,
 
th
'
house
is
so
low
.
<EOS>
I
've
more
mind
to
get
Prissy
and
the
child
and
the
mother
into
the
boat
,
if
I
could
,
and
trusten
to
the
water
,
 
for
th
'
old
house
<EOS>
is
none
so
safe
.
<EOS>
And
if
I
let
go
the
boat
 
<EOS>
but
_
<EOS>
you
_
<EOS>
,
"
he
exclaimed
,
suddenly
lifting
the
light
of
his
lanthorn
on
Maggie
,
as
she
stood
in
the
rain
with
the
oar
in
her
hand
and
her
black
hair
streaming
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
had
no
time
to
answer
,
for
a
new
tidal
current
swept
along
the
line
of
the
houses
,
and
drove
both
the
boats
out
on
to
the
wide
water
,
with
a
force
that
carried
them
far
past
the
meeting
current
of
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
first
moments
Maggie
felt
nothing
,
thought
of
nothing
,
but
that
she
had
suddenly
passed
away
from
that
life
which
she
had
been
dreading
;
it
was
the
transition
of
death
,
without
its
agony
,
 
<EOS>
and
she
was
alone
in
the
darkness
with
God
.
  
<EOS>
The
whole
thing
had
been
so
rapid
,
so
dreamlike
,
that
the
threads
of
ordinary
association
were
broken
;
she
sank
down
on
the
seat
clutching
the
oar
mechanically
,
and
for
a
long
while
had
no
distinct
conception
of
her
position
.
<EOS>
The
first
thing
that
waked
her
to
fuller
consciousness
was
the
cessation
of
the
rain
,
and
a
perception
that
the
darkness
was
divided
by
the
faintest
light
,
which
parted
the
overhanging
gloom
from
the
immeasurable
watery
level
below
.
<EOS>
She
was
driven
out
upon
the
flood
,
 
that
awful
visitation
of
God
which
her
father
used
to
talk
of
;
which
had
made
the
nightmare
of
her
childish
dreams
.
<EOS>
And
with
that
thought
there
rushed
in
the
vision
of
the
old
home
,
and
Tom
,
and
her
mother
,
 
they
had
all
listened
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
God
,
where
am
I
?
<EOS>
Which
is
the
way
home
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cried
out
,
in
the
dim
loneliness
.
  
<EOS>
What
was
happening
to
them
at
the
Mill
?
<EOS>
The
flood
had
once
nearly
destroyed
it
.
<EOS>
They
might
be
in
danger
,
in
distress
,
 
her
mother
and
her
brother
,
alone
there
,
beyond
reach
of
help
!
<EOS>
Her
whole
soul
was
strained
now
on
that
thought
;
and
she
saw
the
long
-
loved
faces
looking
for
help
into
the
darkness
,
and
finding
none
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
floating
in
smooth
water
now
,
 
perhaps
far
on
the
overflooded
fields
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
sense
of
present
danger
to
check
the
outgoing
of
her
mind
to
the
old
home
;
and
she
strained
her
eyes
against
the
curtain
of
gloom
that
she
might
seize
the
first
sight
of
her
whereabout
,
 
that
she
might
catch
some
faint
suggestion
of
the
spot
toward
which
all
her
anxieties
tended
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
welcome
,
the
widening
of
that
dismal
watery
level
,
the
gradual
uplifting
of
the
cloudy
firmament
,
the
slowly
defining
blackness
of
objects
above
the
glassy
dark
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
she
must
be
out
on
the
fields
;
those
were
the
tops
of
hedgerow
trees
.
<EOS>
Which
way
did
the
river
lie
?
<EOS>
Looking
behind
her
,
she
saw
the
lines
of
black
trees
;
looking
before
her
,
there
were
none
;
then
the
river
lay
before
her
.
<EOS>
She
seized
an
oar
and
began
to
paddle
the
boat
forward
with
the
energy
of
wakening
hope
;
the
dawning
seemed
to
advance
more
swiftly
,
now
she
was
in
action
;
and
she
could
soon
see
the
poor
dumb
beasts
crowding
piteously
on
a
mound
where
they
had
taken
refuge
.
<EOS>
Onward
she
paddled
and
rowed
by
turns
in
the
growing
twilight
;
her
wet
clothes
clung
round
her
,
and
her
streaming
hair
was
dashed
about
by
the
wind
,
but
she
was
hardly
conscious
of
any
bodily
sensations
,
 
except
a
sensation
of
strength
,
inspired
by
mighty
emotion
.
<EOS>
Along
with
the
sense
of
danger
and
possible
rescue
for
those
long
-
remembered
beings
at
the
old
home
,
there
was
an
undefined
sense
of
reconcilement
with
her
brother
;
what
quarrel
,
what
harshness
,
what
unbelief
in
each
other
can
subsist
in
the
presence
of
a
great
calamity
,
when
all
the
artificial
vesture
of
our
life
is
gone
,
and
we
are
all
one
with
each
other
in
primitive
mortal
needs
?
<EOS>
Vaguely
Maggie
felt
this
,
in
the
strong
resurgent
love
toward
her
brother
that
swept
away
all
the
later
impressions
of
hard
,
cruel
offence
and
misunderstanding
,
and
left
only
the
deep
,
underlying
,
unshakable
memories
of
early
union
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
there
was
a
large
dark
mass
in
the
distance
,
and
near
to
her
Maggie
could
discern
the
current
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
The
dark
mass
must
be
 
<EOS>
yes
,
it
was
 
St.
Ogg
's
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
now
she
knew
which
way
to
look
for
the
first
glimpse
of
the
well
-
known
trees
 
the
gray
willows
,
the
now
yellowing
chestnuts
 
and
above
them
the
old
roof
!
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
color
,
no
shape
yet
;
all
was
faint
and
dim
.
<EOS>
More
and
more
strongly
the
energies
seemed
to
come
and
put
themselves
forth
,
as
if
her
life
were
a
stored
-
up
force
that
was
being
spent
in
this
hour
,
unneeded
for
any
future
.
  
<EOS>
She
must
get
her
boat
into
the
current
of
the
Floss
,
else
she
would
never
be
able
to
pass
the
Ripple
and
approach
the
house
;
this
was
the
thought
that
occurred
to
her
,
as
she
imagined
with
more
and
more
vividness
<EOS>
the
state
of
things
round
the
old
home
.
<EOS>
But
then
she
might
be
carried
very
far
down
,
and
be
unable
to
guide
her
boat
out
of
the
current
again
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
distinct
ideas
of
danger
began
to
press
upon
her
;
but
there
was
no
choice
of
courses
,
no
room
for
hesitation
,
and
she
floated
into
the
current
.
<EOS>
Swiftly
she
went
now
without
effort
;
more
and
more
clearly
in
the
lessening
distance
and
the
growing
light
<EOS>
she
began
to
discern
the
objects
that
she
knew
must
be
the
well
-
known
trees
and
roofs
;
nay
,
she
was
not
far
off
a
rushing
,
muddy
current
that
must
be
the
strangely
altered
Ripple
.
  
<EOS>
Great
God
!
<EOS>
there
were
floating
masses
in
it
,
that
might
dash
against
her
boat
as
she
passed
,
and
cause
her
to
perish
too
soon
.
<EOS>
What
were
those
masses
?
  
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
Maggie
's
heart
began
to
beat
in
an
agony
of
dread
.
<EOS>
She
sat
helpless
,
dimly
conscious
that
she
was
being
floated
along
,
more
intensely
conscious
of
the
anticipated
clash
.
<EOS>
But
the
horror
was
transient
;
it
passed
away
before
the
oncoming
warehouses
of
St.
Ogg
's
.
<EOS>
She
had
passed
the
mouth
of
the
Ripple
,
then
;
<EOS>
_
now
<EOS>
_
,
she
must
use
all
her
skill
and
power
to
manage
the
boat
and
get
it
if
possible
out
of
the
current
.
<EOS>
She
could
see
now
that
the
bridge
was
broken
down
;
she
could
see
the
masts
of
a
stranded
vessel
far
out
over
the
watery
field
.
<EOS>
But
no
boats
were
to
be
seen
moving
on
the
river
,
 
such
as
had
been
laid
hands
on
were
employed
in
the
flooded
streets
.
  
<EOS>
With
new
resolution
,
Maggie
seized
her
oar
,
and
stood
up
again
to
paddle
;
but
the
now
ebbing
tide
added
to
the
swiftness
of
the
river
,
and
she
was
carried
along
beyond
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
She
could
hear
shouts
from
the
windows
overlooking
the
river
,
as
if
the
people
there
were
calling
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
she
had
passed
on
nearly
to
Tofton
that
she
could
get
the
boat
clear
of
the
current
.
<EOS>
Then
with
one
yearning
look
toward
her
uncle
Deane
's
house
that
lay
farther
down
the
river
,
she
took
to
both
her
oars
and
rowed
with
all
her
might
across
the
watery
fields
,
back
toward
the
Mill
.
<EOS>
Color
was
beginning
to
awake
now
,
and
as
she
approached
the
Dorlcote
fields
,
she
could
discern
the
tints
of
the
trees
,
could
see
the
old
Scotch
firs
far
to
the
right
,
and
the
home
chestnuts
,
 
oh
,
how
deep
they
lay
in
the
water
,
 
deeper
than
the
trees
on
this
side
the
hill
!
<EOS>
And
the
roof
of
the
Mill
 
<EOS>
where
was
it
?
<EOS>
Those
heavy
fragments
hurrying
down
the
Ripple
,
 
what
had
they
meant
?
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
the
house
,
 
the
house
stood
firm
;
drowned
up
to
the
first
story
,
but
still
firm
,
 
or
was
it
broken
in
at
the
end
toward
the
Mill
?
  
<EOS>
With
panting
joy
that
she
was
there
at
last
,
 
joy
that
overcame
all
distress
,
 
Maggie
neared
the
front
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
At
first
she
heard
no
sound
;
she
saw
no
object
moving
.
<EOS>
Her
boat
was
on
a
level
with
the
upstairs
window
.
<EOS>
She
called
out
in
a
loud
,
piercing
voice
,
    
"
Tom
,
where
are
you
?
<EOS>
Mother
,
where
are
you
?
<EOS>
Here
is
Maggie
!
"
  
<EOS>
Soon
,
from
the
window
of
the
attic
in
the
central
gable
,
she
heard
Tom
's
voice
,
    
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
?
<EOS>
Have
you
brought
a
boat
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
I
,
Tom
,
 
Maggie
.
<EOS>
Where
is
mother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
here
;
she
went
to
Garum
the
day
before
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
'll
come
down
to
the
lower
window
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Alone
,
Maggie
?
"
said
Tom
,
in
a
voice
of
deep
astonishment
,
as
he
opened
the
middle
window
,
on
a
level
with
the
boat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Tom
;
God
has
taken
care
of
me
,
to
bring
me
to
you
.
<EOS>
Get
in
quickly
.
<EOS>
Is
there
no
one
else
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Tom
,
stepping
into
the
boat
;
"
I
fear
the
man
is
drowned
;
he
was
carried
down
the
Ripple
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
when
part
of
the
Mill
fell
with
the
crash
of
trees
and
stones
against
it
;
I
've
shouted
again
and
again
,
and
there
has
been
no
answer
.
<EOS>
Give
me
the
oars
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
Tom
had
pushed
off
and
they
were
on
the
wide
water
,
 
<EOS>
he
face
to
face
with
Maggie
,
 
that
the
full
meaning
of
what
had
happened
rushed
upon
his
mind
.
<EOS>
It
came
with
so
overpowering
a
force
,
 
<EOS>
it
was
such
a
new
revelation
to
his
spirit
,
of
the
depths
in
life
that
had
lain
beyond
his
vision
,
which
he
had
fancied
so
keen
and
clear
,
 
that
he
was
unable
to
ask
a
question
.
<EOS>
They
sat
mutely
gazing
at
each
other
,
 
Maggie
with
eyes
of
intense
life
looking
out
from
a
weary
,
beaten
face
;
Tom
pale
,
with
a
certain
awe
and
humiliation
.
<EOS>
Thought
was
busy
though
the
lips
were
silent
;
and
though
he
could
ask
no
question
,
he
guessed
a
story
of
almost
miraculous
,
divinely
protected
effort
.
<EOS>
But
at
last
a
mist
gathered
over
the
blue
-
gray
eyes
,
and
the
lips
found
a
word
they
could
utter
,
 
the
old
childish
"
Magsie
!
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
could
make
no
answer
but
a
long
,
deep
sob
of
that
mysterious
,
wondrous
happiness
that
is
one
with
pain
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
could
speak
,
she
said
,
"
We
will
go
to
Lucy
,
Tom
;
we
'll
go
and
see
if
she
is
safe
,
and
then
we
can
help
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
rowed
with
untired
vigor
,
and
with
a
different
speed
from
poor
Maggie
's
.
<EOS>
The
boat
was
soon
in
the
current
of
the
river
again
,
and
soon
they
would
be
at
Tofton
.
  
<EOS>
"
Park
House
stands
high
up
out
of
the
flood
,
"
said
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
they
have
got
Lucy
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
Nothing
else
was
said
;
a
new
danger
was
being
carried
toward
them
by
the
river
.
<EOS>
Some
wooden
machinery
had
just
given
way
on
one
of
the
wharves
,
and
huge
fragments
were
being
floated
along
.
<EOS>
The
sun
was
rising
now
,
and
the
wide
area
of
watery
desolation
was
spread
out
in
dreadful
clearness
around
them
;
in
dreadful
clearness
floated
onward
the
hurrying
,
threatening
masses
.
<EOS>
A
large
company
in
a
boat
that
was
working
its
way
along
under
the
Tofton
houses
observed
their
danger
,
and
shouted
,
"
Get
out
of
the
current
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
that
could
not
be
done
at
once
;
and
Tom
,
looking
before
him
,
saw
death
rushing
on
them
.
<EOS>
Huge
fragments
,
clinging
together
in
fatal
fellowship
,
made
one
wide
mass
across
the
stream
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
coming
,
Maggie
!
"
<EOS>
Tom
said
,
in
a
deep
,
hoarse
voice
,
loosing
the
oars
,
and
clasping
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
instant
the
boat
was
no
longer
seen
upon
the
water
,
and
the
huge
mass
was
hurrying
on
in
hideous
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
But
soon
the
keel
of
the
boat
reappeared
,
a
black
speck
on
the
golden
water
.
  
<EOS>
The
boat
reappeared
,
but
brother
and
sister
had
gone
down
in
an
embrace
never
to
be
parted
;
living
through
again
in
one
supreme
moment
the
days
when
they
had
clasped
their
little
hands
in
love
,
and
roamed
the
daisied
fields
together
.
  
<EOS>
Conclusion
  
<EOS>
Nature
repairs
her
ravages
,
 
repairs
them
with
her
sunshine
,
and
with
human
labor
.
<EOS>
The
desolation
wrought
by
that
flood
had
left
little
visible
trace
on
the
face
of
the
earth
,
five
years
after
.
<EOS>
The
fifth
autumn
was
rich
in
golden
cornstacks
,
rising
in
thick
clusters
among
the
distant
hedgerows
;
the
wharves
and
warehouses
on
the
Floss
were
busy
again
,
with
echoes
of
eager
voices
,
with
hopeful
lading
and
unlading
.
  
<EOS>
And
every
man
and
woman
mentioned
in
this
history
was
still
living
,
except
those
whose
end
we
know
.
  
<EOS>
Nature
repairs
her
ravages
,
but
not
all
.
<EOS>
The
uptorn
trees
are
not
rooted
again
;
the
parted
hills
are
left
scarred
;
if
there
is
a
new
growth
,
the
trees
are
not
the
same
as
the
old
,
and
the
hills
underneath
their
green
vesture
bear
the
marks
of
the
past
rending
.
<EOS>
To
the
eyes
that
have
dwelt
on
the
past
,
there
is
no
thorough
repair
.
  
<EOS>
Dorlcote
Mill
was
rebuilt
.
<EOS>
And
Dorlcote
churchyard
 
where
the
brick
grave
that
held
a
father
whom
we
know
,
was
found
with
the
stone
laid
prostrate
upon
it
after
the
flood
 
had
recovered
all
its
grassy
order
and
decent
quiet
.
  
<EOS>
Near
that
brick
grave
there
was
a
tomb
erected
,
very
soon
after
the
flood
,
for
two
bodies
that
were
found
in
close
embrace
;
and
it
was
visited
at
different
moments
by
two
men
who
both
felt
that
their
keenest
joy
and
keenest
sorrow
were
forever
buried
there
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
them
visited
the
tomb
again
with
a
sweet
face
beside
him
;
but
that
was
years
after
.
  
<EOS>
The
other
was
always
solitary
.
<EOS>
His
great
companionship
was
among
the
trees
of
the
Red
Deeps
,
where
the
buried
joy
seemed
still
to
hover
,
like
a
revisiting
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
The
tomb
bore
the
names
of
Tom
and
Maggie
Tulliver
,
and
below
the
names
it
was
written
,
                   
"
In
their
death
they
were
not
divided
.
