I
Am
Born
 
Whether
I
shall
turn
out
to
be
the
hero
of
my
own
life
,
or
whether
that
station
will
be
held
by
anybody
else
,
these
pages
must
show
.
<EOS>
To
begin
my
life
with
the
beginning
of
my
life
,
I
record
that
I
was
born
(
as
I
have
been
informed
and
believe
)
on
a
Friday
,
at
twelve
o'clock
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
remarked
that
the
clock
began
to
strike
,
and
I
began
to
cry
,
simultaneously
.
   
<EOS>
In
consideration
of
the
day
and
hour
of
my
birth
,
it
was
declared
by
the
nurse
,
and
by
some
sage
women
in
the
neighbourhood
who
had
taken
a
lively
interest
in
me
several
months
before
there
was
any
possibility
of
our
becoming
personally
acquainted
,
first
,
that
I
was
destined
to
be
unlucky
in
life
;
and
secondly
,
that
I
was
privileged
to
see
ghosts
and
spirits
;
both
these
gifts
inevitably
attaching
,
as
they
believed
,
to
all
unlucky
infants
of
either
gender
,
born
towards
the
small
hours
on
a
Friday
night
.
   
<EOS>
I
need
say
nothing
here
,
on
the
first
head
,
because
nothing
can
show
better
than
my
history
whether
that
prediction
was
verified
or
falsified
by
the
result
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
second
branch
of
the
question
,
I
will
only
remark
,
that
unless
I
ran
through
that
part
of
my
inheritance
while
I
was
still
a
baby
,
I
have
not
come
into
it
yet
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
not
at
all
complain
of
having
been
kept
out
of
this
property
;
and
if
anybody
else
should
be
in
the
present
enjoyment
of
it
,
he
is
heartily
welcome
to
keep
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
born
with
a
caul
,
which
was
advertised
for
sale
,
in
the
newspapers
,
at
the
low
price
of
fifteen
guineas
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
sea
-
going
people
were
short
of
money
about
that
time
,
or
were
short
of
faith
and
preferred
cork
jackets
,
I
do
n't
know
;
all
I
know
is
,
that
there
was
but
one
solitary
bidding
,
and
that
was
from
an
attorney
connected
with
the
bill
-
broking
business
,
who
offered
two
pounds
in
cash
,
and
the
balance
in
sherry
,
but
declined
to
be
guaranteed
from
drowning
on
any
higher
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
Consequently
the
advertisement
was
withdrawn
at
a
dead
loss
---
for
as
to
sherry
,
my
poor
dear
mother
's
own
sherry
was
in
the
market
then
---
and
ten
years
afterwards
,
the
caul
was
put
up
in
a
raffle
down
in
our
part
of
the
country
,
to
fifty
members
at
half
-
a
-
crown
a
head
,
the
winner
to
spend
five
shillings
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
present
myself
,
and
I
remember
to
have
felt
quite
uncomfortable
and
confused
,
at
a
part
of
myself
being
disposed
of
in
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
The
caul
was
won
,
I
recollect
,
by
an
old
lady
with
a
hand
-
basket
,
who
,
very
reluctantly
,
produced
from
it
the
stipulated
five
shillings
,
all
in
halfpence
,
and
twopence
halfpenny
short
---
as
it
took
an
immense
time
and
a
great
waste
of
arithmetic
,
to
endeavour
without
any
effect
to
prove
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
fact
which
will
be
long
remembered
as
remarkable
down
there
,
that
she
was
never
drowned
,
but
died
triumphantly
in
bed
,
at
ninety
-
two
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
understood
that
it
was
,
to
the
last
,
her
proudest
boast
,
that
she
never
had
been
on
the
water
in
her
life
,
except
upon
a
bridge
;
and
that
over
her
tea
(
to
which
she
was
extremely
partial
)
<EOS>
she
,
to
the
last
,
expressed
her
indignation
at
the
impiety
of
mariners
and
others
,
who
had
the
presumption
to
go
<EOS>
"
meandering
"
about
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
to
represent
to
her
that
some
conveniences
,
tea
perhaps
included
,
resulted
from
this
objectionable
practice
.
 
<EOS>
She
always
returned
,
with
greater
emphasis
and
with
an
instinctive
knowledge
of
the
strength
of
her
objection
,
"
Let
us
have
no
meandering
.
"
   
<EOS>
Not
to
meander
myself
,
at
present
,
I
will
go
back
to
my
birth
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
born
at
Blunderstone
,
in
Suffolk
,
or
"
thereby
"
,
as
they
say
in
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
a
posthumous
child
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
's
eyes
had
closed
upon
the
light
of
this
world
six
months
,
when
mine
opened
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
something
strange
to
me
,
even
now
,
in
the
reflection
that
he
never
saw
me
;
and
something
stranger
yet
in
the
shadowy
remembrance
that
I
have
of
my
first
childish
associations
with
his
white
grave
-
stone
in
the
churchyard
,
and
of
the
indefinable
compassion
I
used
to
feel
for
it
lying
out
alone
there
in
the
dark
night
,
when
our
little
parlour
was
warm
and
bright
with
fire
and
candle
,
and
the
doors
of
our
house
were
---
almost
cruelly
,
it
seemed
to
me
sometimes
---
bolted
and
locked
against
it
.
   
<EOS>
An
aunt
of
my
father
's
,
and
consequently
a
great
-
aunt
of
mine
,
of
whom
I
shall
have
more
to
relate
by
and
by
,
was
the
principal
magnate
of
our
family
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Trotwood
,
or
Miss
Betsey
,
as
my
poor
mother
always
called
her
,
when
she
sufficiently
overcame
her
dread
of
this
formidable
personage
to
mention
her
at
all
(
which
was
seldom
)
,
had
been
married
to
a
husband
younger
than
herself
,
who
was
very
handsome
,
except
in
the
sense
of
the
homely
adage
,
"
handsome
is
,
that
handsome
does
"
---
for
he
was
strongly
suspected
of
having
beaten
Miss
Betsey
,
and
even
of
having
once
,
on
a
disputed
question
of
supplies
,
made
some
hasty
but
determined
arrangements
to
throw
her
out
of
a
two
pair
of
stairs
'
window
.
<EOS>
These
evidences
of
an
incompatibility
of
temper
induced
Miss
Betsey
to
pay
him
off
,
and
effect
a
separation
by
mutual
consent
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
to
India
with
his
capital
,
and
there
,
according
to
a
wild
legend
in
our
family
,
he
was
once
seen
riding
on
an
elephant
,
in
company
with
a
Baboon
;
but
I
think
it
must
have
been
a
Baboo
---
or
a
Begum
.
<EOS>
Anyhow
,
from
India
tidings
of
his
death
reached
home
,
within
ten
years
.
 
<EOS>
How
they
affected
my
aunt
,
nobody
knew
;
for
immediately
upon
the
separation
,
she
took
her
maiden
name
again
,
bought
a
cottage
in
a
hamlet
on
the
sea
-
coast
a
long
way
off
,
established
herself
there
as
a
single
woman
with
one
servant
,
and
was
understood
to
live
secluded
,
ever
afterwards
,
in
an
inflexible
retirement
.
   
<EOS>
My
father
had
once
been
a
favourite
of
hers
,
I
believe
;
but
she
was
mortally
affronted
by
his
marriage
,
on
the
ground
that
my
mother
was
"
a
wax
doll
"
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
never
seen
my
mother
,
but
she
knew
her
to
be
not
yet
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
and
Miss
Betsey
never
met
again
.
<EOS>
He
was
double
my
mother
's
age
when
he
married
,
and
of
but
a
delicate
constitution
.
 
<EOS>
He
died
a
year
afterwards
,
and
,
as
I
have
said
,
six
months
before
I
came
into
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
the
state
of
matters
,
on
the
afternoon
of
,
what
I
may
be
excused
for
calling
,
that
eventful
and
important
Friday
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
make
no
claim
therefore
to
have
known
,
at
that
time
,
how
matters
stood
;
or
to
have
any
remembrance
,
founded
on
the
evidence
of
my
own
senses
,
of
what
follows
.
   
<EOS>
My
mother
was
sitting
by
the
fire
,
but
poorly
in
health
,
and
very
low
in
spirits
,
looking
at
it
through
her
tears
,
and
desponding
heavily
about
herself
and
the
fatherless
little
stranger
,
who
was
already
welcomed
by
some
grosses
of
prophetic
pins
,
in
a
drawer
upstairs
,
to
a
world
not
at
all
excited
on
the
subject
of
his
arrival
;
my
mother
,
I
say
,
was
sitting
by
the
fire
,
that
bright
,
windy
March
afternoon
,
very
timid
and
sad
,
and
very
doubtful
of
ever
coming
alive
out
of
the
trial
that
was
before
her
,
when
,
lifting
her
eyes
as
she
dried
them
,
to
the
window
opposite
,
she
saw
a
strange
lady
coming
up
the
garden
.
   
<EOS>
MY
mother
had
a
sure
foreboding
at
the
second
glance
,
that
it
was
Miss
Betsey
.
 
<EOS>
The
setting
sun
was
glowing
on
the
strange
lady
,
over
the
garden
-
fence
,
and
she
came
walking
up
to
the
door
with
a
fell
rigidity
of
figure
and
composure
of
countenance
that
could
have
belonged
to
nobody
else
.
   
<EOS>
When
she
reached
the
house
,
she
gave
another
proof
of
her
identity
.
<EOS>
My
father
had
often
hinted
that
she
seldom
conducted
herself
like
any
ordinary
Christian
;
and
now
,
instead
of
ringing
the
bell
,
she
came
and
looked
in
at
that
identical
window
,
pressing
the
end
of
her
nose
against
the
glass
to
that
extent
,
that
my
poor
dear
mother
used
to
say
it
became
perfectly
flat
and
white
in
a
moment
.
   
<EOS>
She
gave
my
mother
such
a
turn
,
that
I
have
always
been
convinced
I
am
indebted
to
Miss
Betsey
for
having
been
born
on
a
Friday
.
   
<EOS>
My
mother
had
left
her
chair
in
her
agitation
,
and
gone
behind
it
in
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Betsey
,
looking
round
the
room
,
slowly
and
inquiringly
,
began
on
the
other
side
,
and
carried
her
eyes
on
,
like
a
Saracen
's
Head
in
a
Dutch
clock
,
until
they
reached
my
mother
.
<EOS>
Then
she
made
a
frown
and
a
gesture
to
my
mother
,
like
one
who
was
accustomed
to
be
obeyed
,
to
come
and
open
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
went
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
David
Copperfield
,
I
think
,
"
said
Miss
Betsey
;
the
emphasis
referring
,
perhaps
,
to
my
mother
's
mourning
weeds
,
and
her
condition
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
my
mother
,
faintly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Trotwood
,
"
said
the
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
heard
of
her
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
My
mother
answered
she
had
had
that
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
had
a
disagreeable
consciousness
of
not
appearing
to
imply
that
it
had
been
an
overpowering
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
you
see
her
,
"
said
Miss
Betsey
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
bent
her
head
,
and
begged
her
to
walk
in
.
   
<EOS>
They
went
into
the
parlour
my
mother
had
come
from
,
the
fire
in
the
best
room
on
the
other
side
of
the
passage
not
being
lighted
---
not
having
been
lighted
,
indeed
,
since
my
father
's
funeral
;
and
when
they
were
both
seated
,
and
Miss
Betsey
said
nothing
,
my
mother
,
after
vainly
trying
to
restrain
herself
,
began
to
cry
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
tut
,
tut
,
tut
!
"
said
Miss
Betsey
,
in
a
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
do
that
!
<EOS>
Come
,
come
!
"
   
<EOS>
My
mother
could
n't
help
it
notwithstanding
,
so
she
cried
until
she
had
had
her
cry
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
off
your
cap
,
child
,
"
said
Miss
Betsey
,
"
and
let
me
see
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
MY
mother
was
too
much
afraid
of
her
to
refuse
compliance
with
this
odd
request
,
if
she
had
any
disposition
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
she
did
as
she
was
told
,
and
did
it
with
such
nervous
hands
that
her
hair
(
which
was
luxuriant
and
beautiful
)
fell
all
about
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
bless
my
heart
!
"
exclaimed
Miss
Betsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
very
Baby
!
"
   
<EOS>
My
mother
was
,
no
doubt
,
unusually
youthful
in
appearance
even
for
her
years
;
she
hung
her
head
,
as
if
it
were
her
fault
,
poor
thing
,
and
said
,
sobbing
,
that
indeed
she
was
afraid
she
was
but
a
childish
widow
,
and
would
be
but
<EOS>
a
childish
mother
if
she
lived
.
<EOS>
In
a
short
pause
which
ensued
,
she
had
a
fancy
that
she
felt
Miss
Betsey
touch
her
hair
,
and
that
with
no
ungentle
hand
;
but
,
looking
at
her
,
in
her
timid
hope
,
she
found
that
lady
sitting
with
the
skirt
of
her
dress
tucked
up
,
her
hands
folded
on
one
knee
,
and
her
feet
upon
the
fender
,
frowning
at
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
name
of
Heaven
,
"
said
Miss
Betsey
,
suddenly
,
"
why
Rookery
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
the
house
,
ma'am
?
"
asked
my
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
Rookery
?
"
said
Miss
Betsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Cookery
would
have
been
more
to
the
purpose
,
if
you
had
had
any
practical
ideas
of
life
,
either
of
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
name
was
Mr
Copperfield
's
choice
,
"
returned
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
he
bought
the
house
,
he
liked
to
think
that
there
were
rooks
about
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
evening
wind
made
such
a
disturbance
just
now
,
among
some
tall
old
elm
-
trees
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
,
that
neither
my
mother
nor
Miss
Betsey
could
forbear
glancing
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
elms
bent
to
one
another
,
like
giants
who
were
whispering
secrets
,
and
after
a
few
seconds
of
such
repose
,
fell
into
a
violent
flurry
,
tossing
their
wild
arms
about
,
as
if
their
late
confidences
were
really
too
wicked
for
their
peace
of
mind
,
<EOS>
some
weatherbeaten
ragged
old
rooks'-nests
,
burdening
their
higher
branches
,
swung
like
wrecks
upon
a
stormy
sea
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
are
the
birds
?
"
asked
Miss
Betsey
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
---
?
<EOS>
"
My
mother
had
been
thinking
of
something
else
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
rooks
---
what
has
become
of
them
?
"
asked
Miss
Betsey
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
have
not
been
any
since
we
have
lived
here
,
"
said
my
mother
.
<EOS>
"
We
thought
---
Mr
Copperfield
thought
---
it
was
quite
a
large
rookery
;
but
the
nests
were
very
old
ones
,
and
the
birds
have
deserted
them
a
long
while
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
David
Copperfield
all
over
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miss
Betsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
David
Copperfield
from
head
to
foot
!
 
<EOS>
Calls
a
house
a
rookery
when
there
's
not
a
rook
near
it
,
and
takes
the
birds
on
trust
,
because
he
sees
the
nests
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
returned
my
mother
,
"
is
dead
,
and
if
you
dare
to
speak
unkindly
of
him
to
me

"
   
<EOS>
My
poor
dear
mother
,
I
suppose
,
had
some
momentary
intention
of
committing
an
assault
and
battery
upon
my
aunt
,
who
could
easily
have
settled
her
with
one
hand
,
even
if
my
mother
had
been
in
far
better
training
for
such
an
encounter
than
she
was
that
evening
.
<EOS>
But
it
passed
with
the
action
of
rising
from
her
chair
;
and
she
sat
down
again
very
meekly
,
and
fainted
.
   
<EOS>
When
she
came
to
herself
,
or
when
Miss
Betsey
had
restored
her
,
whichever
it
was
,
she
found
the
latter
standing
at
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
The
twilight
was
by
this
time
shading
down
into
darkness
;
and
dimly
as
they
saw
each
other
,
they
could
not
have
done
that
without
the
aid
of
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
"
said
Miss
Betsey
,
coming
back
to
her
chair
,
as
if
she
had
only
been
taking
a
casual
look
at
the
prospect
;
"
and
when
do
you
expect
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
all
in
a
tremble
,
"
faltered
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
's
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
die
,
I
am
sure
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
said
Miss
Betsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
some
tea
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
me
,
dear
me
,
do
you
think
it
will
do
me
any
good
?
"
<EOS>
cried
my
mother
in
a
helpless
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
will
,
"
said
Miss
Betsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
nothing
but
fancy
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
call
your
girl
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
it
will
be
a
girl
,
yet
,
ma'am
,
"
said
my
mother
innocently
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
the
Baby
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Miss
Betsey
,
unconsciously
quoting
the
second
sentiment
of
the
pincushion
in
the
drawer
upstairs
,
but
applying
it
to
my
mother
instead
of
me
,
"
I
do
n't
mean
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
your
servant
-
girl
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Peggotty
,
"
said
my
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
Peggotty
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Miss
Betsey
,
with
some
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
say
,
child
,
that
any
human
being
has
gone
into
a
Christian
church
,
and
got
herself
named
Peggotty
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
her
surname
,
"
said
my
mother
,
faintly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Copperfield
called
her
by
it
,
because
her
Christian
name
was
the
same
as
mine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
!
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Miss
Betsey
,
opening
the
parlour
door
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tea
.
 
<EOS>
Your
mistress
is
a
little
unwell
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
dawdle
.
"
   
<EOS>
Having
issued
this
mandate
with
as
much
potentiality
as
if
she
had
been
a
recognized
authority
in
the
house
ever
since
it
had
been
a
house
,
and
having
looked
out
to
confront
the
amazed
Peggotty
coming
along
the
passage
with
a
candle
at
the
sound
of
a
strange
voice
,
Miss
Betsey
shut
the
door
again
,
and
sat
down
as
before
:
with
her
feet
on
the
fender
,
the
skirt
of
her
dress
tucked
up
,
and
her
hands
folded
on
one
knee
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
were
speaking
about
its
being
a
girl
,
"
said
Miss
Betsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
it
will
be
a
girl
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
presentiment
that
it
must
be
a
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Now
child
,
from
the
moment
of
the
birth
of
this
girl
---
"
   
"
Perhaps
boy
,
"
my
mother
took
the
liberty
of
putting
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
I
have
a
presentiment
that
it
must
be
a
girl
,
"
returned
Miss
Betsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
contradict
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
moment
of
this
girl
's
birth
,
child
,
I
intend
to
be
her
friend
.
 
<EOS>
I
intend
to
be
her
godmother
,
and
I
beg
you
'll
call
her
Betsey
Trotwood
Copperfield
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
no
mistakes
in
life
with
THIS
Betsey
Trotwood
.
 
<EOS>
There
must
be
no
trifling
with
HER
affections
,
poor
dear
.
 
<EOS>
She
must
be
well
brought
up
,
and
well
guarded
from
reposing
any
foolish
confidences
where
they
are
not
deserved
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
make
that
MY
care
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
twitch
of
Miss
Betsey
's
head
,
after
each
of
these
sentences
,
as
if
her
own
old
wrongs
were
working
within
her
,
and
she
repressed
any
plainer
reference
to
them
by
strong
constraint
.
<EOS>
So
my
mother
suspected
,
at
least
,
as
she
observed
her
by
the
low
glimmer
of
the
fire
:
too
much
scared
by
Miss
Betsey
,
too
uneasy
in
herself
,
and
too
subdued
and
bewildered
altogether
,
to
observe
anything
very
clearly
,
or
to
know
what
to
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
was
David
good
to
you
,
child
?
"
asked
Miss
Betsey
,
when
she
had
been
silent
for
a
little
while
,
and
these
motions
of
her
head
had
gradually
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
"
Were
you
comfortable
together
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
were
very
happy
,
"
said
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Copperfield
was
only
too
good
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
he
spoilt
you
,
I
suppose
?
"
returned
Miss
Betsey
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
being
quite
alone
and
dependent
on
myself
in
this
rough
world
again
,
yes
,
I
fear
he
did
indeed
,
"
sobbed
my
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
Do
n't
cry
!
"
said
Miss
Betsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
were
not
equally
matched
,
child
---
if
any
two
people
can
be
equally
matched
---
and
so
I
asked
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
an
orphan
,
were
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
a
governess
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
nursery
-
governess
in
a
family
where
Mr
Copperfield
came
to
visit
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
was
very
kind
to
me
,
and
took
a
great
deal
of
notice
of
me
,
and
paid
me
a
good
deal
of
attention
,
and
at
last
proposed
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
accepted
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
we
were
married
,
"
said
my
mother
simply
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
Baby
!
"
<EOS>
mused
Miss
Betsey
,
with
her
frown
still
bent
upon
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
anything
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
ma'am
,
"
faltered
my
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
About
keeping
house
,
for
instance
,
"
said
Miss
Betsey
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
much
,
I
fear
,
"
returned
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
much
as
I
could
wish
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Copperfield
was
teaching
me
---
"
   
(
"
Much
he
knew
about
it
himself
!
"
)
said
Miss
Betsey
in
a
parenthesis
.
   
<EOS>
---
"
And
I
hope
I
should
have
improved
,
being
very
anxious
to
learn
,
and
he
very
patient
to
teach
me
,
if
the
great
misfortune
of
his
death
"
---
my
mother
broke
down
again
here
,
and
could
get
no
farther
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
"
said
Miss
Betsey
.
   
<EOS>
---
"
I
kept
my
housekeeping
-
book
regularly
,
and
balanced
it
with
Mr
Copperfield
every
night
,
"
cried
my
mother
in
another
burst
of
distress
,
and
breaking
down
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
"
said
Miss
Betsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
cry
any
more
.
"
   
---
"
<EOS>
And
I
am
sure
we
never
had
a
word
of
difference
respecting
it
,
except
when
Mr
Copperfield
objected
to
my
threes
and
fives
being
too
much
like
each
other
,
or
to
my
putting
curly
tails
to
my
sevens
and
nines
,
"
resumed
my
mother
in
another
burst
,
and
breaking
down
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
make
yourself
ill
,
"
said
Miss
Betsey
,
"
and
you
know
that
will
not
be
good
either
for
you
or
for
my
god
-
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
You
must
n't
do
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
argument
had
some
share
in
quieting
my
mother
,
though
her
increasing
indisposition
had
a
larger
one
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
interval
of
silence
,
only
broken
by
Miss
Betsey
's
occasionally
ejaculating
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
as
she
sat
with
her
feet
upon
the
fender
.
   
<EOS>
"
David
had
bought
an
annuity
for
himself
with
his
money
,
I
know
,
"
said
she
,
by
and
by
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
do
for
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
said
my
mother
,
answering
with
some
difficulty
,
"
was
so
considerate
and
good
<EOS>
as
to
secure
the
reversion
of
a
part
of
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
much
?
"
asked
Miss
Betsey
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
hundred
and
five
pounds
a
year
,
"
said
my
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
might
have
done
worse
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
The
word
was
appropriate
to
the
moment
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
was
so
much
worse
that
Peggotty
,
coming
in
with
the
teaboard
and
candles
,
and
seeing
at
a
glance
how
ill
she
was
,
---
as
Miss
Betsey
might
have
done
sooner
if
there
had
been
light
enough
,
---
conveyed
her
upstairs
to
her
own
room
with
all
speed
;
and
immediately
dispatched
Ham
Peggotty
,
her
nephew
,
who
had
been
for
some
days
past
secreted
in
the
house
,
unknown
to
my
mother
,
as
a
special
messenger
in
case
of
emergency
,
to
fetch
the
nurse
and
doctor
.
   
<EOS>
Those
allied
powers
were
considerably
astonished
,
when
they
arrived
within
a
few
minutes
of
each
other
,
to
find
an
unknown
lady
of
portentous
appearance
,
sitting
before
the
fire
,
with
her
bonnet
tied
over
her
left
arm
,
stopping
her
ears
with
jewellers
'
cotton
.
<EOS>
Peggotty
knowing
nothing
about
her
,
and
my
mother
saying
nothing
about
her
,
she
was
quite
a
mystery
in
the
parlour
;
and
the
fact
of
her
having
a
magazine
of
jewellers
'
cotton
in
her
pocket
,
and
sticking
the
article
in
her
ears
in
that
way
,
did
not
detract
from
the
solemnity
of
her
presence
.
   
<EOS>
The
doctor
having
been
upstairs
and
come
down
again
,
and
having
satisfied
himself
,
I
suppose
,
that
there
was
a
probability
of
this
unknown
lady
and
himself
having
to
sit
there
,
face
to
face
,
for
some
hours
,
laid
himself
out
to
be
polite
and
social
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
meekest
of
his
sex
,
the
mildest
of
little
men
.
 
<EOS>
He
sidled
in
and
out
of
a
room
,
to
take
up
the
less
space
.
 
<EOS>
He
walked
as
softly
as
the
Ghost
in
Hamlet
,
and
more
slowly
.
 
<EOS>
He
carried
his
head
on
one
side
,
partly
in
modest
depreciation
of
himself
,
partly
in
modest
propitiation
of
everybody
else
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
nothing
to
say
that
he
had
n't
a
word
to
throw
at
a
dog
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
n't
have
thrown
a
word
at
a
mad
dog
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
have
offered
him
one
gently
,
or
half
a
one
,
or
a
fragment
of
one
;
for
he
spoke
as
slowly
as
he
walked
;
but
he
would
n't
have
been
rude
to
him
,
and
he
could
n't
have
been
quick
with
him
,
for
any
earthly
consideration
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chillip
,
looking
mildly
at
my
aunt
with
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
making
her
a
little
bow
,
said
,
in
allusion
to
the
jewellers
'
cotton
,
as
he
softly
touched
his
left
ear
:
   
<EOS>
"
Some
local
irritation
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
replied
my
aunt
,
pulling
the
cotton
out
of
one
ear
like
a
cork
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chillip
was
so
alarmed
by
her
abruptness
---
as
he
told
my
mother
afterwards
---
that
it
was
a
mercy
he
did
n't
lose
his
presence
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
repeated
sweetly
:
   
<EOS>
"
Some
local
irritation
,
ma'am
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
"
<EOS>
replied
my
aunt
,
and
corked
herself
again
,
at
one
blow
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chillip
could
do
nothing
after
this
,
but
sit
and
look
at
her
feebly
,
as
she
sat
and
looked
at
the
fire
,
until
he
was
called
upstairs
again
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
quarter
of
an
hour
's
absence
,
he
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
"
said
my
aunt
,
taking
the
cotton
out
of
the
ear
nearest
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
,
"
returned
Mr
Chillip
,
"
<EOS>
we
are
---
we
are
progressing
slowly
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ba
-
a
-
ah
!
"
said
my
aunt
,
with
a
perfect
shake
on
the
contemptuous
interjection
.
 
<EOS>
And
corked
herself
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
Really
---
really
---
as
Mr
Chillip
told
my
mother
,
he
was
almost
shocked
;
speaking
in
a
professional
point
of
view
alone
,
he
was
almost
shocked
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
sat
and
looked
at
her
,
notwithstanding
,
for
nearly
two
hours
,
as
she
sat
looking
at
the
fire
,
until
he
was
again
called
out
.
 
<EOS>
After
another
absence
,
he
again
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
"
said
my
aunt
,
taking
out
the
cotton
on
that
side
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
,
"
returned
Mr
Chillip
,
"
<EOS>
we
are
---
we
are
progressing
slowly
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ya
-
<EOS>
a
-
ah
!
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
With
such
a
snarl
at
him
,
that
Mr
Chillip
absolutely
could
not
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
really
calculated
to
break
his
spirit
,
he
said
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
preferred
to
go
and
sit
upon
the
stairs
,
in
the
dark
and
a
strong
draught
,
until
he
was
again
sent
for
.
   
<EOS>
Ham
Peggotty
,
who
went
to
the
national
school
,
and
was
a
very
dragon
at
his
catechism
,
and
who
may
therefore
be
regarded
as
a
credible
witness
,
reported
next
day
,
that
happening
to
peep
in
at
the
parlour
-
door
an
hour
after
this
,
he
was
instantly
descried
by
Miss
Betsey
,
then
walking
to
and
fro
in
a
state
of
agitation
,
and
pounced
upon
before
he
could
make
his
escape
.
 
<EOS>
That
there
were
now
occasional
sounds
of
feet
and
voices
overhead
<EOS>
which
he
inferred
the
cotton
did
not
exclude
,
from
the
circumstance
of
his
evidently
being
clutched
by
the
lady
as
a
victim
on
whom
to
expend
her
superabundant
agitation
when
the
sounds
were
loudest
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
marching
him
constantly
up
and
down
by
the
collar
(
as
if
he
had
been
taking
too
much
laudanum
)
,
she
,
at
those
times
,
shook
him
,
rumpled
his
hair
,
made
light
of
his
linen
,
stopped
his
ears
as
if
she
confounded
them
with
her
own
,
and
otherwise
tousled
and
maltreated
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
in
part
confirmed
by
his
aunt
,
who
saw
him
at
half
past
twelve
o'clock
,
soon
after
his
release
,
and
affirmed
that
he
was
then
as
red
as
I
was
.
   
<EOS>
The
mild
Mr
Chillip
could
not
possibly
bear
malice
at
such
a
time
,
if
at
any
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
sidled
into
the
parlour
as
soon
as
he
was
at
liberty
,
and
said
to
my
aunt
in
his
meekest
manner
:
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
,
I
am
happy
to
congratulate
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
upon
?
"
said
my
aunt
,
sharply
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chillip
was
fluttered
again
,
by
the
extreme
severity
of
my
aunt
's
manner
;
so
he
made
her
a
little
bow
and
gave
her
a
little
smile
,
to
mollify
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mercy
on
the
man
,
what
's
he
doing
!
"
<EOS>
cried
my
aunt
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ca
n't
he
speak
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Be
calm
,
my
dear
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Chillip
,
in
his
softest
accents
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
longer
any
occasion
for
uneasiness
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
Be
calm
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
has
since
been
considered
almost
a
miracle
that
my
aunt
did
n't
shake
him
,
and
shake
what
he
had
to
say
,
out
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
only
shook
her
own
head
at
him
,
but
in
a
way
that
made
him
quail
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
,
"
resumed
Mr
Chillip
,
as
soon
as
he
had
courage
,
"
I
am
happy
to
congratulate
you
.
 
<EOS>
All
is
now
over
,
ma'am
,
and
well
over
.
"
   
<EOS>
During
the
five
minutes
or
so
that
Mr
Chillip
devoted
to
the
delivery
of
this
oration
,
my
aunt
eyed
him
narrowly
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
is
she
?
"
said
my
aunt
,
folding
her
arms
with
her
bonnet
still
tied
on
one
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
,
she
will
soon
be
quite
comfortable
,
I
hope
,
"
returned
Mr
Chillip
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
as
comfortable
as
we
can
expect
a
young
mother
to
be
,
under
these
melancholy
domestic
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
There
can
not
be
any
objection
to
your
seeing
her
presently
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
do
her
good
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
SHE
.
 
<EOS>
How
is
SHE
?
"
said
my
aunt
,
sharply
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chillip
laid
his
head
a
little
more
on
one
side
,
and
looked
at
my
aunt
like
an
amiable
bird
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
baby
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
is
she
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ma'am
,
"
returned
Mr
Chillip
,
"
<EOS>
I
apprehended
you
had
known
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
boy
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
said
never
a
word
,
but
took
her
bonnet
by
the
strings
,
in
the
manner
of
a
sling
,
aimed
a
blow
at
Mr
Chillip
's
head
with
it
,
put
it
on
bent
,
walked
out
,
and
never
came
back
.
 
<EOS>
She
vanished
like
a
discontented
fairy
;
or
like
one
of
those
supernatural
beings
,
whom
it
was
popularly
supposed
I
was
entitled
to
see
;
and
never
came
back
any
more
.
   
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
lay
in
my
basket
,
and
my
mother
lay
in
her
bed
;
but
Betsey
Trotwood
Copperfield
was
for
ever
in
the
land
of
dreams
and
shadows
,
<EOS>
the
tremendous
region
whence
I
had
so
lately
travelled
;
and
the
light
upon
the
window
of
our
room
shone
out
upon
the
earthly
bourne
of
all
such
travellers
,
and
the
mound
above
the
ashes
and
the
dust
that
once
was
he
,
without
whom
I
had
never
been
.

Chapter
2
.
<EOS>
I
Observe
 
<EOS>
The
first
objects
that
assume
a
distinct
presence
before
me
,
as
I
look
far
back
,
into
the
blank
of
my
infancy
,
are
my
mother
with
her
pretty
hair
and
youthful
shape
,
and
Peggotty
with
no
shape
at
all
,
and
eyes
<EOS>
so
dark
that
they
seemed
to
darken
their
whole
neighbourhood
in
her
face
,
and
cheeks
and
arms
so
hard
and
red
that
I
wondered
the
birds
did
n't
peck
her
in
preference
to
apples
.
   
<EOS>
I
believe
I
can
remember
these
two
at
a
little
distance
apart
,
dwarfed
to
my
sight
by
stooping
down
or
kneeling
on
the
floor
,
and
I
going
unsteadily
from
the
one
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
an
impression
on
my
mind
which
I
can
not
distinguish
from
actual
remembrance
,
of
the
touch
of
Peggotty
's
forefinger
as
she
used
to
hold
it
out
to
me
,
and
of
its
being
roughened
by
needlework
,
like
a
pocket
nutmeg
-
grater
.
   
<EOS>
This
may
be
fancy
,
though
I
think
the
memory
of
most
of
us
can
go
farther
back
into
such
times
than
many
of
us
suppose
;
just
as
I
believe
the
power
of
observation
in
numbers
of
very
young
children
to
be
quite
wonderful
for
its
closeness
and
accuracy
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
think
that
most
grown
men
who
are
remarkable
in
this
respect
,
may
with
greater
propriety
be
said
not
to
have
lost
the
faculty
,
than
to
have
acquired
it
;
the
rather
,
as
I
generally
observe
such
men
to
retain
a
certain
freshness
,
and
gentleness
,
and
capacity
of
being
pleased
,
which
are
also
an
inheritance
they
have
preserved
from
their
childhood
.
   
<EOS>
I
might
have
a
misgiving
that
I
am
"
meandering
"
in
stopping
to
say
this
,
but
that
it
brings
me
to
remark
that
I
build
these
conclusions
,
in
part
upon
my
own
experience
of
myself
;
and
if
it
should
appear
from
anything
I
may
set
down
in
this
narrative
that
I
was
a
child
of
close
observation
,
or
that
as
a
man
I
have
a
strong
memory
of
my
childhood
,
I
undoubtedly
lay
claim
to
both
of
these
characteristics
.
   
<EOS>
Looking
back
,
as
I
was
saying
,
into
the
blank
of
my
infancy
,
the
first
objects
I
can
remember
as
standing
out
by
themselves
from
a
confusion
of
things
,
are
my
mother
and
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
What
else
do
I
remember
?
 
<EOS>
Let
me
see
.
   
<EOS>
There
comes
out
of
the
cloud
,
our
house
---
not
new
to
me
,
but
quite
familiar
,
in
its
earliest
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
ground
-
floor
is
Peggotty
's
kitchen
,
opening
into
a
back
yard
;
with
a
pigeon
-
house
on
a
pole
,
in
the
centre
,
without
any
pigeons
in
it
;
a
great
dog
-
kennel
in
a
corner
,
without
any
dog
;
and
a
quantity
of
fowls
that
look
terribly
tall
to
me
,
walking
about
,
in
a
menacing
and
ferocious
manner
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
one
cock
who
gets
upon
a
post
to
crow
,
and
seems
to
take
particular
notice
of
me
as
I
look
at
him
through
the
kitchen
window
,
who
makes
me
shiver
,
he
is
so
fierce
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
geese
outside
the
side
-
gate
who
come
waddling
after
me
with
their
long
necks
<EOS>
stretched
out
when
I
go
that
way
<EOS>
,
I
dream
at
night
:
<EOS>
as
a
man
environed
by
wild
beasts
might
dream
of
lions
.
   
<EOS>
Here
is
a
long
passage
---
what
an
enormous
perspective
I
make
of
it
!
<EOS>
---
leading
from
Peggotty
's
kitchen
to
the
front
door
.
 
<EOS>
A
dark
store
-
room
opens
out
of
it
,
and
that
is
a
place
to
be
run
past
at
night
;
for
I
do
n't
know
what
may
be
among
those
tubs
and
jars
and
old
tea
-
chests
,
when
there
is
nobody
in
there
with
a
dimly
-
burning
light
,
letting
a
mouldy
air
come
out
of
the
door
,
in
which
there
is
the
smell
of
soap
,
pickles
,
pepper
,
candles
,
and
coffee
,
all
at
one
whiff
.
 
<EOS>
Then
there
are
the
two
parlours
:
the
parlour
in
which
we
sit
of
an
evening
,
my
mother
and
I
and
Peggotty
---
for
Peggotty
is
quite
our
companion
,
when
her
work
is
done
and
we
are
alone
---
and
the
best
parlour
where
we
sit
on
a
Sunday
;
grandly
,
but
not
so
comfortably
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
something
of
a
doleful
air
about
that
room
to
me
,
for
Peggotty
has
told
me
---
I
do
n't
know
when
,
<EOS>
but
apparently
ages
ago
---
about
my
father
's
funeral
,
and
the
company
having
their
black
cloaks
put
on
.
 
<EOS>
One
Sunday
night
my
mother
reads
to
Peggotty
and
me
in
there
,
how
Lazarus
was
raised
up
from
the
dead
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
am
so
frightened
that
they
are
afterwards
obliged
to
take
me
out
of
bed
,
and
show
me
the
quiet
churchyard
out
of
the
bedroom
window
,
with
the
dead
all
lying
in
their
graves
at
rest
,
below
the
solemn
moon
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
half
so
green
that
I
know
anywhere
,
as
the
grass
of
that
churchyard
;
nothing
half
so
shady
as
its
trees
;
nothing
half
so
quiet
as
its
tombstones
.
 
<EOS>
The
sheep
are
feeding
there
,
when
I
kneel
up
,
early
in
the
morning
,
in
my
little
bed
in
a
closet
within
my
mother
's
room
,
to
look
out
at
it
;
and
I
see
the
red
light
shining
on
the
sun
-
dial
,
and
think
within
myself
,
"
Is
the
sun
-
dial
glad
,
I
wonder
,
that
it
can
tell
the
time
again
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Here
is
our
pew
in
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
high
-
backed
pew
!
 
<EOS>
With
a
window
near
it
,
out
of
which
our
house
can
be
seen
,
and
IS
seen
many
times
during
the
morning
's
service
,
by
Peggotty
,
who
likes
to
make
herself
as
sure
as
she
can
that
it
's
not
being
robbed
,
or
is
not
in
flames
.
 
<EOS>
But
though
Peggotty
's
eye
wanders
,
she
is
much
offended
if
mine
does
,
and
frowns
to
me
,
as
I
stand
upon
the
seat
,
that
I
am
to
look
at
the
clergyman
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
always
look
at
him
---
I
know
him
without
that
white
thing
on
,
and
I
am
afraid
of
his
wondering
why
I
stare
so
,
and
perhaps
stopping
the
service
to
inquire
---
and
what
am
I
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
dreadful
thing
to
gape
,
but
I
must
do
something
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
at
my
mother
,
but
she
pretends
not
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
at
a
boy
in
the
aisle
,
and
he
makes
faces
at
me
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
the
sunlight
coming
in
at
the
open
door
through
the
porch
,
and
there
I
see
a
stray
sheep
<EOS>
---
I
do
n't
mean
a
sinner
,
but
mutton
---
half
making
up
his
mind
to
come
into
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
if
I
looked
at
him
any
longer
,
I
might
be
tempted
to
say
something
out
loud
;
and
what
would
become
of
me
then
!
 
<EOS>
I
look
up
at
the
monumental
tablets
on
the
wall
,
and
try
to
think
of
Mr
Bodgers
late
of
this
parish
,
and
what
the
feelings
of
Mrs
Bodgers
must
have
been
,
when
affliction
sore
,
long
time
Mr
Bodgers
bore
,
and
physicians
were
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
they
called
in
Mr
Chillip
,
and
he
was
in
vain
;
and
if
so
,
how
he
likes
to
be
reminded
of
it
once
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
from
Mr
Chillip
,
in
his
Sunday
neckcloth
,
to
the
pulpit
;
and
think
what
a
good
place
it
would
be
to
play
in
,
and
what
a
castle
it
would
make
,
with
another
boy
coming
up
the
stairs
to
attack
it
,
and
having
the
velvet
cushion
with
the
tassels
thrown
down
on
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
In
time
my
eyes
gradually
shut
up
;
and
,
from
seeming
to
hear
the
clergyman
singing
a
drowsy
song
in
the
heat
,
I
hear
nothing
,
until
I
fall
off
the
seat
with
a
crash
,
and
am
taken
out
,
more
dead
than
alive
,
by
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
I
see
the
outside
of
our
house
,
with
the
latticed
bedroom
-
windows
standing
open
to
let
in
the
sweet
-
smelling
air
,
and
<EOS>
the
ragged
old
rooks'-nests
still
dangling
in
the
elm
-
trees
at
the
bottom
of
the
front
garden
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
am
in
the
garden
at
the
back
,
beyond
the
yard
where
the
empty
pigeon
-
house
and
dog
-
kennel
are
---
a
very
preserve
of
butterflies
,
as
I
remember
it
,
with
a
high
fence
,
and
a
gate
and
padlock
;
where
the
fruit
clusters
on
the
trees
,
riper
and
richer
than
fruit
has
ever
been
since
,
in
any
other
garden
,
and
where
my
mother
gathers
some
in
a
basket
,
while
I
stand
by
,
bolting
furtive
gooseberries
,
and
trying
to
look
unmoved
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
wind
rises
,
and
the
summer
is
gone
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
We
are
playing
in
the
winter
twilight
,
dancing
about
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
When
my
mother
is
out
of
breath
and
rests
herself
in
an
elbow
-
chair
,
I
watch
her
winding
her
bright
curls
round
her
fingers
,
and
straitening
her
waist
,
and
nobody
knows
better
than
I
do
that
she
likes
to
look
so
well
,
and
is
proud
of
being
so
pretty
.
   
<EOS>
That
is
among
my
very
earliest
impressions
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
and
a
sense
that
we
were
both
a
little
afraid
of
Peggotty
,
and
submitted
ourselves
in
most
things
to
her
direction
,
were
among
the
first
opinions
---
if
they
may
be
so
called
---
that
I
ever
derived
from
what
I
saw
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
and
I
were
sitting
one
night
by
the
parlour
fire
,
alone
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
reading
to
Peggotty
about
crocodiles
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
read
very
perspicuously
,
or
the
poor
soul
must
have
been
deeply
interested
,
for
I
remember
she
had
a
cloudy
impression
,
after
I
had
done
,
that
they
were
a
sort
of
vegetable
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
tired
of
reading
,
and
dead
sleepy
;
but
having
leave
,
as
a
high
treat
,
to
sit
up
until
my
mother
came
home
from
spending
the
evening
at
a
neighbour
's
,
I
would
rather
have
died
upon
my
post
(
of
course
)
than
have
gone
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
reached
that
stage
of
sleepiness
when
Peggotty
seemed
to
swell
and
grow
immensely
large
.
 
<EOS>
I
propped
my
eyelids
open
with
my
two
forefingers
,
and
looked
perseveringly
at
her
as
she
sat
at
work
;
at
the
little
bit
of
wax
-
candle
she
kept
for
her
thread
---
how
old
it
looked
,
being
so
wrinkled
in
all
directions
!
<EOS>
---
at
the
little
house
with
a
thatched
roof
,
where
the
yard
-
measure
lived
;
at
her
work
-
box
with
a
sliding
lid
,
with
a
view
of
St
Paul
's
Cathedral
(
with
a
pink
dome
)
painted
on
the
top
;
at
the
brass
thimble
on
her
finger
;
at
herself
,
whom
I
thought
lovely
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
so
sleepy
,
that
I
knew
if
I
lost
sight
of
anything
for
a
moment
,
I
was
gone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Peggotty
,
"
says
I
,
suddenly
,
"
were
you
ever
married
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
,
Master
Davy
,
"
replied
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
put
marriage
in
your
head
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
answered
with
such
a
start
,
that
it
quite
awoke
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
she
stopped
in
her
work
,
and
looked
at
me
,
with
her
needle
drawn
out
to
its
thread
's
length
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
WERE
you
ever
married
,
Peggotty
?
"
says
I.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
very
handsome
woman
,
an't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
thought
her
in
a
different
style
from
my
mother
,
certainly
;
but
of
another
school
of
beauty
,
I
considered
her
a
perfect
example
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
red
velvet
footstool
in
the
best
parlour
,
on
which
my
mother
had
painted
a
nosegay
.
 
<EOS>
The
ground
-
work
of
that
stool
,
and
Peggotty
's
complexion
appeared
to
me
to
be
one
and
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
The
stool
was
smooth
,
and
Peggotty
was
rough
,
but
that
made
no
difference
.
   
<EOS>
"
Me
handsome
,
Davy
!
"
said
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lawk
,
no
,
my
dear
!
 
<EOS>
But
what
put
marriage
in
your
head
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
!
<EOS>
---
You
must
n't
marry
more
than
one
person
at
a
time
,
may
you
,
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
says
Peggotty
,
with
the
promptest
decision
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
marry
a
person
,
and
the
person
dies
,
why
then
you
may
marry
another
person
,
may
n't
you
,
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
YOU
MAY
,
"
says
Peggotty
,
"
if
you
choose
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
a
matter
of
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
what
is
your
opinion
,
Peggotty
?
"
said
I.
   
I
asked
her
,
and
looked
curiously
at
her
,
because
she
looked
so
curiously
at
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
opinion
is
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
taking
her
eyes
from
me
,
after
a
little
indecision
and
going
on
with
her
work
,
"
that
I
never
was
married
myself
,
Master
Davy
,
and
that
I
do
n't
expect
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
I
know
about
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
an't
cross
,
I
suppose
,
Peggotty
,
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
said
I
,
after
sitting
quiet
for
a
minute
.
   
<EOS>
I
really
thought
she
was
,
she
had
been
so
short
with
me
;
but
I
was
quite
mistaken
:
for
she
laid
aside
her
work
(
which
was
a
stocking
of
her
own
)
,
and
opening
her
arms
wide
,
took
my
curly
head
within
them
,
and
gave
it
a
good
squeeze
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
was
a
good
squeeze
,
because
,
being
very
plump
,
whenever
she
made
any
little
exertion
after
she
was
dressed
,
some
of
the
buttons
on
the
back
of
her
gown
flew
off
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
recollect
two
bursting
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
parlour
,
while
she
was
hugging
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
let
me
hear
some
more
about
the
Crorkindills
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
who
was
not
quite
right
in
the
name
yet
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
an't
heard
half
enough
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
n't
quite
understand
why
Peggotty
looked
so
queer
,
or
why
she
was
so
ready
to
go
back
to
the
crocodiles
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
we
returned
to
those
monsters
,
with
fresh
wakefulness
on
my
part
,
and
we
left
their
eggs
in
the
sand
for
the
sun
to
hatch
;
and
we
ran
away
from
them
,
and
baffled
them
by
constantly
turning
,
which
they
were
unable
to
do
quickly
,
on
account
of
their
unwieldy
make
;
and
we
went
into
the
water
after
them
,
as
natives
,
and
put
sharp
pieces
of
timber
down
their
throats
;
and
in
short
we
ran
the
whole
crocodile
gauntlet
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
,
at
least
;
but
I
had
my
doubts
of
Peggotty
,
who
was
thoughtfully
sticking
her
needle
into
various
parts
of
her
face
and
arms
,
all
the
time
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
exhausted
the
crocodiles
,
and
begun
with
the
alligators
,
when
the
garden
-
bell
rang
.
 
<EOS>
We
went
out
to
the
door
;
and
there
was
my
mother
,
looking
unusually
pretty
,
I
thought
,
and
with
her
a
gentleman
with
beautiful
black
hair
and
whiskers
,
who
had
walked
home
with
us
from
church
last
Sunday
.
   
<EOS>
As
my
mother
stooped
down
on
the
threshold
to
take
me
in
her
arms
and
kiss
me
,
the
gentleman
said
I
was
a
more
highly
privileged
little
fellow
than
a
monarch
---
or
something
like
that
;
for
my
later
understanding
comes
,
I
am
sensible
,
to
my
aid
here
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
does
that
mean
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
him
,
over
her
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
He
patted
me
on
the
head
;
but
somehow
,
I
did
n't
like
him
or
his
deep
voice
,
and
I
was
jealous
that
his
hand
should
touch
my
mother
's
in
touching
me
---
which
it
did
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
it
away
,
as
well
as
I
could
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Davy
!
<EOS>
"
remonstrated
my
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
boy
!
"
said
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
wonder
at
his
devotion
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
never
saw
such
a
beautiful
colour
on
my
mother
's
face
before
.
<EOS>
She
gently
chid
me
for
being
rude
;
and
,
keeping
me
close
to
her
shawl
,
turned
to
thank
the
gentleman
for
taking
so
much
trouble
as
to
bring
her
home
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
out
her
hand
to
him
as
she
spoke
,
and
,
as
he
met
it
with
his
own
,
she
glanced
,
I
thought
,
at
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
us
say
"
good
night
"
,
my
fine
boy
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
when
he
had
bent
his
head
---
I
saw
him
!
<EOS>
---
over
my
mother
's
little
glove
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
night
!
"
said
<EOS>
I.
   
"
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Let
us
be
the
best
friends
in
the
world
!
"
said
the
gentleman
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shake
hands
!
"
   
<EOS>
My
right
hand
was
in
my
mother
's
left
,
so
I
gave
him
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
that
's
the
Wrong
hand
,
Davy
!
"
laughed
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
MY
mother
drew
my
right
hand
forward
,
but
I
was
resolved
,
for
my
former
reason
,
not
to
give
it
him
,
and
I
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
gave
him
the
other
,
and
he
shook
it
heartily
,
and
said
I
was
a
brave
fellow
,
and
went
away
.
   
<EOS>
At
this
minute
I
see
him
turn
round
in
the
garden
,
and
give
us
a
last
look
with
his
ill
-
omened
black
eyes
,
before
the
door
was
shut
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
,
who
had
not
said
a
word
or
moved
a
finger
,
secured
the
fastenings
instantly
,
and
we
all
went
into
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
,
contrary
to
her
usual
habit
,
instead
of
coming
to
the
elbow
-
chair
by
the
fire
,
remained
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
and
sat
singing
to
herself
.
   
<EOS>
---
"
Hope
you
have
had
a
pleasant
evening
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
standing
as
stiff
as
a
barrel
in
the
centre
of
the
room
,
with
a
candlestick
in
her
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Much
obliged
to
you
,
Peggotty
,
"
returned
my
mother
,
in
a
cheerful
voice
,
"
I
have
had
a
VERY
pleasant
evening
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
A
stranger
or
so
makes
an
agreeable
change
,
"
suggested
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
very
agreeable
change
,
indeed
,
"
returned
my
mother
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
continuing
to
stand
motionless
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
my
mother
resuming
her
singing
<EOS>
,
I
fell
asleep
,
though
I
was
not
so
sound
asleep
<EOS>
but
that
I
could
hear
voices
,
without
hearing
what
they
said
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
half
awoke
from
this
uncomfortable
doze
,
I
found
Peggotty
and
my
mother
both
in
tears
,
and
both
talking
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
such
a
one
as
this
,
Mr
Copperfield
would
n't
have
liked
,
"
said
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
say
,
and
that
I
swear
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
Heavens
!
"
cried
my
mother
,
"
you
'll
drive
me
mad
!
 
<EOS>
Was
ever
any
poor
girl
so
ill
-
used
by
her
servants
as
I
am
!
 
<EOS>
Why
do
I
do
myself
the
injustice
of
calling
myself
a
girl
?
 
<EOS>
Have
I
never
been
married
,
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
God
knows
you
have
,
ma'am
,
"
returned
Peggotty
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
,
how
can
you
dare
,
"
said
my
mother
---
"
<EOS>
you
know
I
do
n't
mean
how
can
you
dare
,
Peggotty
,
but
how
can
you
have
the
heart
---
to
make
me
so
uncomfortable
and
say
such
bitter
things
to
me
,
when
you
are
well
aware
that
I
have
n't
,
out
of
this
place
,
a
single
friend
to
turn
to
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
more
's
the
reason
,
"
returned
Peggotty
,
"
for
saying
that
it
wo
n't
do
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
That
it
wo
n't
do
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
No
price
could
make
it
do
.
<EOS>
No
!
"
---
I
thought
Peggotty
would
have
thrown
the
candlestick
away
,
she
was
so
emphatic
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
be
so
aggravating
,
"
said
my
mother
,
shedding
more
tears
than
before
,
"
as
to
talk
in
such
an
unjust
manner
!
 
<EOS>
How
can
you
go
on
as
if
it
was
all
settled
and
arranged
,
<EOS>
Peggotty
,
when
I
tell
you
over
and
over
again
,
you
cruel
thing
,
that
beyond
the
commonest
civilities
nothing
has
passed
!
 
<EOS>
You
talk
of
admiration
.
<EOS>
What
am
I
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
If
people
are
so
silly
as
to
indulge
the
sentiment
,
is
it
my
fault
?
 
<EOS>
What
am
I
to
do
,
I
ask
you
?
 
<EOS>
Would
you
wish
me
to
shave
my
head
and
black
my
face
,
or
disfigure
myself
with
a
burn
,
or
a
scald
,
or
something
of
that
sort
?
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
would
,
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
'd
quite
enjoy
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
seemed
to
take
this
aspersion
very
much
to
heart
,
I
thought
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
my
dear
boy
,
"
cried
my
mother
,
coming
to
the
elbow
-
chair
in
which
I
was
,
and
caressing
me
,
"
my
own
little
Davy
!
 
<EOS>
Is
it
to
be
hinted
to
me
that
I
am
wanting
in
affection
for
my
precious
treasure
,
the
dearest
little
fellow
that
ever
was
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nobody
never
went
and
hinted
no
such
a
thing
,
"
said
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
did
,
Peggotty
!
"
returned
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
you
did
.
 
<EOS>
What
else
was
it
possible
to
infer
from
what
you
said
,
you
unkind
creature
,
when
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
,
that
on
his
account
only
last
quarter
I
would
n't
buy
myself
a
new
parasol
,
though
that
old
green
one
is
frayed
the
whole
way
up
,
and
the
fringe
is
perfectly
mangy
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
it
is
,
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
deny
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Then
,
turning
affectionately
to
me
,
with
her
cheek
against
mine
,
"
Am
I
a
naughty
mama
to
you
,
Davy
?
 
<EOS>
Am
I
a
nasty
,
cruel
,
selfish
,
bad
mama
?
<EOS>
Say
I
am
,
my
child
;
say
"
yes
"
,
dear
boy
,
and
Peggotty
will
love
you
;
and
Peggotty
's
love
is
a
great
deal
better
than
mine
,
Davy
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
love
you
at
all
,
do
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
,
we
all
fell
a
-
crying
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
was
the
loudest
of
the
party
,
but
I
am
sure
we
were
all
sincere
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
quite
heart
-
broken
myself
,
and
am
afraid
that
in
the
first
transports
of
wounded
tenderness
I
called
Peggotty
a
"
Beast
"
.
 
<EOS>
That
honest
creature
was
in
deep
affliction
,
I
remember
,
and
must
have
become
quite
buttonless
on
the
occasion
;
for
a
little
volley
of
those
explosives
went
off
,
when
,
after
having
made
it
up
with
my
mother
,
she
kneeled
down
by
the
elbow
-
chair
,
and
made
it
up
with
me
.
   
<EOS>
We
went
to
bed
greatly
dejected
.
 
<EOS>
My
sobs
kept
waking
me
,
for
a
long
time
;
and
when
one
very
strong
sob
quite
hoisted
me
up
in
bed
,
I
found
my
mother
sitting
on
the
coverlet
,
and
leaning
over
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
fell
asleep
in
her
arms
,
after
that
,
and
slept
soundly
.
   
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
the
following
Sunday
when
I
saw
the
gentleman
again
,
or
whether
there
was
any
greater
lapse
of
time
before
he
reappeared
,
I
can
not
recall
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
profess
to
be
clear
about
dates
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
he
was
,
in
church
,
and
he
walked
home
with
us
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
in
,
too
,
to
look
at
a
famous
geranium
we
had
,
in
the
parlour
-
window
.
 
<EOS>
It
did
not
appear
to
me
that
he
took
much
notice
of
it
,
but
before
he
went
he
asked
my
mother
to
give
him
a
bit
of
the
blossom
.
 
<EOS>
She
begged
him
to
choose
it
for
himself
,
but
he
refused
to
do
that
<EOS>
---
I
could
not
understand
why
---
so
she
plucked
it
for
him
,
and
gave
it
into
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
would
never
,
never
part
with
it
any
more
;
and
I
thought
he
must
be
quite
a
fool
not
to
know
that
it
would
fall
to
pieces
in
a
day
or
two
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
began
to
be
less
with
us
,
of
an
evening
,
than
she
had
always
been
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
deferred
to
her
very
much
---
more
than
usual
,
it
occurred
to
me
---
and
we
were
all
three
excellent
friends
;
still
we
were
different
from
what
we
used
to
be
,
and
were
not
so
comfortable
among
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
fancied
that
Peggotty
perhaps
objected
to
my
mother
's
wearing
all
the
pretty
dresses
she
had
in
her
drawers
,
or
to
her
going
so
often
to
visit
at
that
neighbour
's
;
but
I
could
n't
,
to
my
satisfaction
,
make
out
how
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
Gradually
,
I
became
used
to
seeing
the
gentleman
with
the
black
whiskers
.
 
<EOS>
I
liked
him
no
better
than
at
first
,
and
had
the
same
uneasy
jealousy
of
him
;
but
if
I
had
any
reason
for
it
beyond
a
child
's
instinctive
dislike
,
and
a
general
idea
that
Peggotty
and
I
could
make
much
of
my
mother
without
any
help
,
it
certainly
was
not
THE
reason
that
I
might
have
found
if
I
had
been
older
.
 
<EOS>
No
such
thing
came
into
my
mind
,
or
near
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
observe
,
in
little
pieces
,
as
it
were
;
but
as
to
making
a
net
of
a
number
of
these
pieces
,
and
catching
anybody
in
it
,
that
was
,
as
yet
,
beyond
me
.
   
<EOS>
One
autumn
morning
I
was
with
my
mother
in
the
front
garden
,
when
Mr
Murdstone
---
I
knew
him
by
that
name
now
---
came
by
,
on
horseback
.
 
<EOS>
He
reined
up
his
horse
to
salute
my
mother
,
and
said
he
was
going
to
Lowestoft
to
see
some
friends
who
were
there
with
a
yacht
,
and
merrily
proposed
to
take
me
on
the
saddle
before
him
if
I
would
like
the
ride
.
   
<EOS>
The
air
was
so
clear
and
pleasant
,
and
the
horse
seemed
to
like
the
idea
of
the
ride
so
much
himself
,
as
he
stood
snorting
and
pawing
at
the
garden
-
gate
,
that
I
had
a
great
desire
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
was
sent
upstairs
to
Peggotty
to
be
made
spruce
;
and
in
the
meantime
Mr
Murdstone
dismounted
,
and
,
with
his
horse
's
bridle
drawn
over
his
arm
,
walked
slowly
up
and
down
on
the
outer
side
of
the
sweetbriar
fence
,
while
my
mother
walked
slowly
up
and
down
on
the
inner
to
keep
him
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
Peggotty
<EOS>
and
I
peeping
out
at
them
from
my
little
window
;
I
recollect
how
closely
they
seemed
to
be
examining
the
sweetbriar
between
them
,
as
they
strolled
along
;
and
how
,
from
being
in
a
perfectly
angelic
temper
,
Peggotty
turned
cross
in
a
moment
,
and
brushed
my
hair
the
wrong
way
,
excessively
hard
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Murdstone
and
I
were
soon
off
,
and
trotting
along
on
the
green
turf
by
the
side
of
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
me
quite
easily
with
one
arm
,
and
I
do
n't
think
I
was
restless
usually
;
but
I
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
sit
in
front
of
him
without
turning
my
head
sometimes
,
and
looking
up
in
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
that
kind
of
shallow
black
eye
<EOS>
---
I
want
a
better
word
to
express
an
eye
that
has
no
depth
in
it
to
be
looked
into
---
which
,
when
it
is
abstracted
,
seems
from
some
peculiarity
of
light
to
be
disfigured
,
for
a
moment
at
a
time
,
by
a
cast
.
 
<EOS>
Several
times
when
I
glanced
at
him
,
I
observed
that
appearance
with
a
sort
of
awe
,
and
wondered
what
he
was
thinking
about
so
closely
.
 
<EOS>
His
hair
and
whiskers
were
blacker
and
thicker
,
looked
at
so
near
,
than
even
I
had
given
them
credit
for
being
.
 
<EOS>
A
squareness
about
the
lower
part
of
his
face
,
and
the
dotted
indication
of
the
strong
black
beard
he
shaved
close
every
day
,
reminded
me
of
the
wax
-
work
that
had
travelled
into
our
neighbourhood
some
half
-
a
-
year
before
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
his
regular
eyebrows
,
and
the
rich
white
,
and
black
,
and
brown
,
of
his
complexion
---
confound
his
complexion
,
and
his
memory
!
---
made
me
think
him
,
in
spite
of
my
misgivings
,
a
very
handsome
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
that
my
poor
dear
mother
thought
him
so
too
.
   
<EOS>
We
went
to
an
hotel
by
the
sea
,
where
two
gentlemen
were
smoking
cigars
in
a
room
by
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Each
of
them
was
lying
on
at
least
four
chairs
,
and
had
a
large
rough
jacket
on
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
corner
was
a
heap
of
coats
and
boat
-
cloaks
,
and
a
flag
,
all
bundled
up
together
.
   
<EOS>
They
both
rolled
on
to
their
feet
in
an
untidy
sort
of
manner
,
when
we
came
in
,
and
said
,
"
Halloa
,
Murdstone
!
 
<EOS>
We
thought
you
were
dead
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
,
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
who
's
this
shaver
?
<EOS>
"
said
one
of
the
gentlemen
,
taking
hold
of
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
Davy
,
"
returned
Mr
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Davy
who
?
"
said
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jones
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
Bewitching
<EOS>
Mrs
Copperfield
's
encumbrance
?
"
cried
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
pretty
little
widow
?
"
   
"
Quinion
,
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
,
"
take
care
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
Somebody
's
sharp
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
is
?
"
asked
the
gentleman
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
I
looked
up
,
quickly
;
being
curious
to
know
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
Brooks
of
Sheffield
,
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
quite
relieved
to
find
that
it
was
only
Brooks
of
Sheffield
;
for
,
at
first
,
I
really
thought
it
was
<EOS>
I.
   
There
seemed
to
be
something
very
comical
in
the
reputation
of
Mr
Brooks
of
Sheffield
,
for
both
the
gentlemen
laughed
heartily
when
he
was
mentioned
,
and
Mr
Murdstone
was
a
good
deal
amused
also
.
<EOS>
After
some
laughing
,
the
gentleman
whom
he
had
called
Quinion
,
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
And
what
is
the
opinion
of
Brooks
of
Sheffield
,
in
reference
to
the
projected
business
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
do
n't
know
that
Brooks
understands
much
about
it
at
present
,
"
replied
Mr
Murdstone
;
"
but
he
is
not
generally
favourable
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
more
laughter
at
this
,
and
Mr
Quinion
said
he
would
ring
the
bell
for
some
sherry
in
which
to
drink
to
Brooks
.
 
<EOS>
This
he
did
;
and
when
the
wine
came
,
he
made
me
have
a
little
,
with
a
biscuit
,
and
,
before
I
drank
it
,
stand
up
and
say
,
"
Confusion
to
Brooks
of
Sheffield
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
toast
was
received
with
great
applause
,
and
such
hearty
laughter
that
it
made
me
laugh
too
;
at
which
they
laughed
the
more
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
we
quite
enjoyed
ourselves
.
   
<EOS>
We
walked
about
on
the
cliff
after
that
,
and
sat
on
the
grass
,
and
looked
at
things
through
a
telescope
---
I
could
make
out
nothing
myself
when
it
was
put
to
my
eye
,
but
I
pretended
I
could
---
<EOS>
and
then
we
came
back
to
the
hotel
to
an
early
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
time
we
were
out
,
the
two
gentlemen
smoked
incessantly
---
which
,
I
thought
,
if
I
might
judge
from
the
smell
of
their
rough
coats
,
they
must
have
been
doing
,
ever
since
the
coats
had
first
come
home
from
the
tailor
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
not
forget
that
we
went
on
board
the
yacht
,
where
they
all
three
descended
into
the
cabin
,
and
were
busy
with
some
papers
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
them
quite
hard
at
work
,
when
I
looked
down
through
the
open
skylight
.
 
<EOS>
They
left
me
,
during
this
time
,
with
a
very
nice
man
with
a
very
large
head
of
red
hair
and
a
very
small
shiny
hat
upon
it
,
who
had
got
a
cross
-
barred
shirt
or
waistcoat
on
,
with
"
Skylark
"
in
capital
letters
across
the
chest
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
his
name
;
and
that
as
he
lived
on
board
ship
and
had
n't
a
street
door
to
put
his
name
on
,
he
put
it
there
instead
;
but
when
I
called
him
Mr
Skylark
,
he
said
it
meant
the
vessel
.
   
<EOS>
I
observed
all
day
that
Mr
Murdstone
was
graver
and
steadier
than
the
two
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
very
gay
and
careless
.
 
<EOS>
They
joked
freely
with
one
another
,
but
seldom
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
appeared
to
me
that
he
was
more
clever
and
cold
than
they
were
,
and
that
they
regarded
him
with
something
of
my
own
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
I
remarked
that
,
once
or
twice
when
Mr
Quinion
was
talking
,
he
looked
at
Mr
Murdstone
sideways
,
as
if
to
make
sure
of
his
not
being
displeased
;
and
that
once
when
Mr
Passnidge
(
the
other
gentleman
)
was
in
high
spirits
,
he
trod
upon
his
foot
,
and
gave
him
a
secret
caution
with
his
eyes
,
to
observe
Mr
Murdstone
,
who
was
sitting
stern
and
silent
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
do
I
recollect
that
Mr
Murdstone
laughed
at
all
that
day
,
except
at
the
Sheffield
joke
---
and
that
,
by
the
by
,
was
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
We
went
home
early
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
fine
evening
,
and
my
mother
<EOS>
and
he
had
another
stroll
by
the
sweetbriar
,
while
I
was
sent
in
to
get
my
tea
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
gone
,
my
mother
asked
me
all
about
the
day
I
had
had
,
and
what
they
had
said
and
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
mentioned
what
they
had
said
about
her
,
and
she
laughed
,
and
told
me
they
were
impudent
fellows
who
talked
nonsense
---
<EOS>
but
I
knew
it
pleased
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
it
quite
as
well
as
I
know
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
the
opportunity
of
asking
if
she
was
at
all
acquainted
with
Mr
Brooks
of
Sheffield
,
but
she
answered
No
,
only
she
supposed
he
must
be
a
manufacturer
in
the
knife
and
fork
way
.
   
<EOS>
Can
I
say
of
her
face
---
altered
as
I
have
reason
to
remember
it
,
perished
as
I
know
it
is
---
that
it
is
gone
,
when
here
it
comes
before
me
at
this
instant
,
as
distinct
as
any
face
that
I
may
choose
to
look
on
in
a
crowded
street
?
 
<EOS>
Can
I
say
of
her
innocent
and
girlish
beauty
,
that
it
faded
,
and
was
no
more
,
when
its
breath
falls
on
my
cheek
now
,
as
it
fell
that
night
?
 
<EOS>
Can
I
say
she
ever
changed
,
when
my
remembrance
brings
her
back
to
life
,
thus
only
;
and
,
truer
to
its
loving
youth
than
I
have
been
,
or
man
ever
is
,
still
holds
fast
what
it
cherished
then
?
   
<EOS>
I
write
of
her
just
as
she
was
when
I
had
gone
to
bed
after
this
talk
,
and
she
came
to
bid
me
good
night
.
 
<EOS>
She
kneeled
down
playfully
by
the
side
of
the
bed
,
and
laying
her
chin
upon
her
hands
,
and
laughing
,
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
What
was
it
<EOS>
they
said
,
Davy
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
believe
it
.

Bewitching

<EOS>
"
"
I
began
.
   
<EOS>
My
mother
put
her
hands
upon
my
lips
to
stop
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
never
bewitching
,
"
she
said
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
never
could
have
been
bewitching
,
Davy
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
know
it
was
n't
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bewitching
Mrs
Copperfield
"
,
"
I
repeated
stoutly
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
"
pretty
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
No
,
no
,
it
was
never
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
Not
pretty
,
"
interposed
my
mother
,
laying
her
fingers
on
my
lips
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pretty
little
widow
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
foolish
,
impudent
creatures
!
<EOS>
"
cried
my
mother
,
laughing
and
covering
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
ridiculous
men
!
 
<EOS>
An't
they
?
 
<EOS>
Davy
dear
---
"
   
"
Well
,
Ma
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
n't
tell
Peggotty
;
she
might
be
angry
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
dreadfully
angry
with
them
myself
;
but
I
would
rather
Peggotty
did
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
promised
,
of
course
;
and
we
kissed
one
another
over
and
over
again
,
and
I
soon
fell
fast
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
,
at
this
distance
of
time
,
as
if
it
were
the
next
day
when
Peggotty
broached
the
striking
and
adventurous
proposition
<EOS>
I
am
about
to
mention
;
but
it
was
probably
about
two
months
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
sitting
as
before
,
one
evening
(
when
my
mother
was
out
as
before
)
,
in
company
with
the
stocking
and
the
yard
-
measure
,
and
the
bit
of
wax
,
and
the
box
with
St
Paul
's
on
the
lid
,
and
the
crocodile
book
,
when
Peggotty
,
after
looking
at
me
several
times
,
and
opening
her
mouth
as
if
she
were
going
to
speak
,
without
doing
it
---
which
I
thought
was
merely
gaping
,
or
I
should
have
been
rather
alarmed
---
said
coaxingly
:
   
"
<EOS>
Master
Davy
,
how
should
you
like
to
go
along
with
me
and
spend
a
fortnight
at
my
brother
's
at
Yarmouth
?
 
<EOS>
Would
n't
that
be
a
treat
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
your
brother
an
agreeable
man
,
Peggotty
?
"
<EOS>
I
inquired
,
provisionally
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
an
agreeable
man
he
is
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Peggotty
,
holding
up
her
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
there
's
the
sea
;
and
the
boats
and
ships
;
and
the
fishermen
;
and
the
beach
;
and
<EOS>
Am%
to
play
with
---
"
   
Peggotty
meant
her
nephew
Ham
,
mentioned
in
my
first
chapter
;
but
she
spoke
of
him
as
a
morsel
of
English
Grammar
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
flushed
by
her
summary
of
delights
,
and
replied
that
it
would
indeed
be
a
treat
,
but
what
would
my
mother
say
?
   
<EOS>
"
Why
then
I
'll
as
good
as
bet
a
guinea
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
intent
upon
my
face
,
"
that
she
'll
let
us
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
ask
her
,
if
you
like
,
as
soon
as
ever
she
comes
home
.
 
<EOS>
There
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
what
's
she
to
do
while
we
're
away
?
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
putting
my
small
elbows
on
the
table
to
argue
the
point
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
ca
n't
live
by
herself
.
"
   
<EOS>
If
Peggotty
were
looking
for
a
hole
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
in
the
heel
of
that
stocking
,
it
must
have
been
a
very
little
one
indeed
,
and
not
worth
darning
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
!
 
<EOS>
She
ca
n't
live
by
herself
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
Peggotty
,
looking
at
me
again
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
?
 
<EOS>
She
's
going
to
stay
for
a
fortnight
with
Mrs
Grayper
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Grayper
's
going
to
have
a
lot
of
company
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
If
that
was
it
,
I
was
quite
ready
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
waited
,
in
the
utmost
impatience
,
until
my
mother
came
home
from
Mrs
Grayper
's
<EOS>
(
for
it
was
that
identical
neighbour
)
,
to
ascertain
if
we
could
get
leave
to
carry
out
this
great
idea
.
 
<EOS>
Without
being
nearly
so
much
surprised
as
I
had
expected
,
my
mother
entered
into
it
readily
;
and
it
was
all
arranged
that
night
,
and
my
board
and
lodging
during
the
visit
were
to
be
paid
for
.
   
<EOS>
The
day
soon
came
for
our
going
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
such
an
early
day
that
it
came
soon
,
even
to
me
,
who
was
in
a
fever
of
expectation
,
and
half
afraid
that
an
earthquake
or
a
fiery
mountain
,
or
some
other
great
convulsion
of
nature
,
might
interpose
to
stop
the
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
to
go
in
a
carrier
's
cart
,
which
departed
in
the
morning
after
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
given
any
money
to
have
been
allowed
to
wrap
myself
up
over
-
night
,
and
sleep
in
my
hat
and
boots
.
   
<EOS>
It
touches
me
nearly
now
,
although
I
tell
it
lightly
,
to
recollect
how
eager
I
was
to
leave
my
happy
home
;
to
think
how
little
I
suspected
what
I
did
leave
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
recollect
that
when
the
carrier
's
cart
was
at
the
gate
,
and
my
mother
stood
there
kissing
me
,
a
grateful
fondness
for
her
and
for
the
old
place
<EOS>
I
had
never
turned
my
back
upon
before
,
made
me
cry
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
know
that
my
mother
cried
too
,
and
that
I
felt
her
heart
beat
against
mine
.
   
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
recollect
that
when
the
carrier
began
to
move
,
my
mother
ran
out
at
the
gate
,
and
called
to
him
to
stop
,
that
she
might
kiss
me
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
dwell
upon
the
earnestness
and
love
with
which
she
lifted
up
her
face
to
mine
,
and
did
so
.
   
<EOS>
As
we
left
her
standing
in
the
road
,
Mr
Murdstone
came
up
to
where
she
was
,
and
seemed
to
expostulate
with
her
for
being
so
moved
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
looking
back
round
the
awning
of
the
cart
,
and
wondered
what
business
it
was
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
,
who
was
also
looking
back
on
the
other
side
,
seemed
anything
but
satisfied
;
as
the
face
she
brought
back
in
the
cart
denoted
.
   
<EOS>
I
sat
looking
at
Peggotty
for
some
time
,
in
a
reverie
on
this
supposititious
case
:
whether
,
if
she
were
employed
to
lose
me
like
the
boy
in
the
fairy
tale
,
I
should
be
able
to
track
my
way
home
again
by
the
buttons
she
would
shed
.
      
<EOS>
Chapter
3
.
<EOS>
I
Have
a
Change
 
<EOS>
The
carrier
's
horse
was
the
laziest
horse
in
the
world
,
I
should
hope
,
and
shuffled
along
,
with
his
head
down
,
as
if
he
liked
to
keep
people
waiting
to
whom
the
packages
were
directed
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancied
,
indeed
,
that
he
sometimes
chuckled
audibly
over
this
reflection
,
but
the
carrier
said
he
was
only
troubled
with
a
cough
.
<EOS>
The
carrier
had
a
way
of
keeping
his
head
down
,
like
his
horse
,
and
of
drooping
sleepily
forward
as
he
drove
,
with
one
of
his
arms
on
each
of
his
knees
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
"
drove
"
,
but
it
struck
me
that
the
cart
would
have
gone
to
Yarmouth
quite
as
well
without
him
,
for
the
horse
<EOS>
did
all
that
;
and
as
to
conversation
,
he
had
no
idea
of
it
but
whistling
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
had
a
basket
of
refreshments
on
her
knee
,
which
would
have
lasted
us
out
handsomely
,
if
we
had
been
going
to
London
by
the
same
conveyance
.
 
<EOS>
We
ate
a
good
deal
,
and
slept
a
good
deal
.
<EOS>
Peggotty
always
went
to
sleep
with
her
chin
upon
the
handle
of
the
basket
,
her
hold
of
which
never
relaxed
;
and
I
could
not
have
believed
unless
I
had
heard
her
do
it
,
that
one
defenceless
woman
could
have
snored
so
much
.
   
<EOS>
We
made
so
many
deviations
up
and
down
lanes
,
and
were
such
a
long
time
delivering
a
bedstead
at
a
public
-
house
,
and
calling
at
other
places
,
that
I
was
quite
tired
,
and
very
glad
,
when
we
saw
Yarmouth
.
 
<EOS>
It
looked
rather
spongy
and
soppy
,
I
thought
,
as
I
carried
my
eye
over
the
great
dull
waste
that
lay
across
the
river
;
and
I
could
not
help
wondering
,
if
the
world
were
really
as
round
as
my
geography
book
said
,
how
any
part
of
it
came
to
be
so
flat
.
<EOS>
But
I
reflected
that
Yarmouth
might
be
situated
at
one
of
the
poles
;
which
would
account
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
As
we
drew
a
little
nearer
,
and
saw
the
whole
adjacent
prospect
lying
a
straight
low
line
under
the
sky
,
I
hinted
to
Peggotty
that
a
mound
or
so
might
have
improved
it
;
and
also
that
if
the
land
had
been
a
little
more
separated
from
the
sea
,
and
the
town
and
the
tide
had
not
been
quite
so
much
mixed
up
,
like
toast
and
water
,
it
would
have
been
nicer
.
 
<EOS>
But
Peggotty
said
,
with
greater
emphasis
than
usual
,
that
we
must
take
things
as
we
found
them
,
and
that
,
for
her
part
,
she
was
proud
to
call
herself
a
Yarmouth
Bloater
.
   
<EOS>
When
we
got
into
the
street
(
which
was
strange
enough
to
me
)
and
smelt
the
fish
,
and
pitch
,
and
oakum
,
and
tar
,
and
saw
the
sailors
walking
about
,
and
the
carts
jingling
up
and
down
over
the
stones
<EOS>
,
I
felt
that
I
had
done
so
busy
a
place
an
injustice
;
and
said
as
much
to
Peggotty
,
who
heard
my
expressions
of
delight
with
great
complacency
,
and
told
me
it
was
well
known
(
I
suppose
to
those
who
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
born
Bloaters
)
that
Yarmouth
was
,
upon
the
whole
,
the
finest
place
in
the
universe
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
my
Am%
!
"
<EOS>
screamed
Peggotty
,
"
growed
out
of
knowledge
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
waiting
for
us
,
in
fact
,
at
the
public
-
house
;
and
asked
me
how
I
found
myself
,
like
an
old
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
feel
,
at
first
,
that
I
knew
him
as
well
as
he
knew
me
,
because
he
had
never
come
to
our
house
since
the
night
I
was
born
,
and
naturally
he
had
the
advantage
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
our
intimacy
was
much
advanced
by
his
taking
me
on
his
back
to
carry
me
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
,
now
,
a
huge
,
strong
fellow
of
six
feet
high
,
broad
in
proportion
,
and
round
-
shouldered
;
but
with
a
simpering
boy
's
face
and
curly
light
hair
that
gave
him
quite
a
sheepish
look
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
a
canvas
jacket
,
and
a
pair
of
such
very
stiff
trousers
that
they
would
have
stood
quite
as
well
alone
,
without
any
legs
in
them
.
<EOS>
And
you
could
n't
so
properly
have
said
he
wore
a
hat
,
as
that
he
was
covered
in
a
-
top
,
like
an
old
building
,
with
something
pitchy
.
   
<EOS>
Ham
carrying
me
on
his
back
and
a
small
box
of
ours
under
his
arm
,
and
Peggotty
carrying
another
small
box
of
ours
,
we
turned
down
lanes
bestrewn
with
bits
of
chips
and
little
hillocks
of
sand
,
and
went
past
gas
-
works
,
rope
-
walks
,
boat
-
builders
'
yards
,
shipwrights
'
yards
,
ship
-
breakers
'
yards
,
caulkers
'
yards
,
riggers
'
lofts
,
smiths
'
forges
,
and
a
great
litter
of
such
places
,
until
we
came
out
upon
the
dull
waste
I
had
already
seen
at
a
distance
;
when
Ham
said
,
   
"
Yon
's
our
house
,
Mas'r
Davy
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
looked
in
all
directions
,
as
far
as
I
could
stare
over
the
wilderness
,
and
away
at
the
sea
,
and
away
at
the
river
,
but
no
house
<EOS>
could
I
make
out
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
black
barge
,
or
some
other
kind
of
superannuated
boat
,
not
far
off
,
high
and
dry
on
the
ground
,
with
an
iron
funnel
sticking
out
of
it
for
a
chimney
and
smoking
very
cosily
;
but
nothing
else
in
the
way
of
a
habitation
that
was
visible
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
it
?
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
That
ship
-
looking
thing
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
returned
Ham
.
   
<EOS>
If
it
had
been
Aladdin
's
palace
,
roc
's
egg
and
all
,
I
suppose
I
could
not
have
been
more
charmed
with
the
romantic
idea
of
living
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
delightful
door
cut
in
the
side
,
and
it
was
roofed
in
,
and
there
were
little
windows
in
it
;
but
the
wonderful
charm
of
it
was
,
that
it
was
a
real
boat
which
had
no
doubt
been
upon
the
water
hundreds
of
times
,
and
which
had
never
been
intended
to
be
lived
in
,
on
dry
land
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
the
captivation
of
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
If
it
had
ever
been
meant
to
be
lived
in
,
I
might
have
thought
it
small
,
or
inconvenient
,
or
lonely
;
but
never
having
been
designed
for
any
such
use
,
it
became
a
perfect
abode
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
beautifully
clean
inside
,
and
as
tidy
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
table
,
and
a
Dutch
clock
,
and
a
chest
of
drawers
,
and
on
the
chest
of
drawers
there
was
a
tea
-
tray
with
a
painting
on
it
of
a
lady
with
a
parasol
,
taking
a
walk
with
a
military
-
looking
child
who
was
trundling
a
hoop
.
 
<EOS>
The
tray
was
kept
from
tumbling
down
,
by
a
bible
;
and
the
tray
,
if
it
had
tumbled
down
,
would
have
smashed
a
quantity
of
cups
and
saucers
and
a
teapot
that
were
grouped
around
the
book
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
walls
there
were
some
common
coloured
pictures
,
framed
and
glazed
,
of
scripture
subjects
;
such
as
I
have
never
seen
since
in
the
hands
of
pedlars
,
without
seeing
the
whole
interior
of
Peggotty
's
brother
's
house
again
,
at
one
view
.
 
<EOS>
Abraham
in
red
going
to
sacrifice
Isaac
in
blue
,
and
Daniel
in
yellow
cast
into
a
den
of
green
lions
,
were
the
most
prominent
of
these
.
 
<EOS>
Over
the
little
mantelshelf
,
was
a
picture
of
the
"
Sarah
Jane
"
lugger
,
built
at
Sunderland
,
with
a
real
little
wooden
stern
stuck
on
to
it
;
a
work
of
art
,
combining
composition
with
carpentry
,
which
I
considered
to
be
one
of
the
most
enviable
possessions
that
the
world
could
afford
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
some
hooks
in
the
beams
of
the
ceiling
,
the
use
of
which
I
did
not
divine
then
;
and
some
lockers
and
boxes
and
conveniences
of
that
sort
,
which
served
for
seats
and
eked
out
the
chairs
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
I
saw
in
the
first
glance
after
I
crossed
the
threshold
---
<EOS>
child
-
like
,
according
to
my
theory
---
and
then
Peggotty
opened
a
little
door
and
showed
me
my
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
<EOS>
the
completest
and
most
desirable
bedroom
ever
seen
<EOS>
---
in
the
stern
of
the
vessel
;
with
a
little
window
,
where
the
rudder
used
to
go
through
;
a
little
looking
-
glass
,
just
the
right
height
for
me
,
nailed
against
the
wall
,
and
framed
with
oyster
-
shells
;
a
little
bed
,
which
there
was
just
room
enough
to
get
into
;
and
a
nosegay
of
seaweed
in
a
blue
mug
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
The
walls
were
whitewashed
as
white
as
milk
,
and
the
patchwork
counterpane
made
my
eyes
quite
ache
with
its
brightness
.
 
<EOS>
One
thing
I
particularly
noticed
in
this
delightful
house
,
was
the
smell
of
fish
;
which
was
so
searching
,
that
when
I
took
out
my
pocket
-
handkerchief
to
wipe
my
nose
,
I
found
it
smelt
exactly
as
if
it
had
wrapped
up
a
lobster
.
 
<EOS>
On
my
imparting
this
discovery
in
confidence
to
Peggotty
,
she
informed
me
that
her
brother
dealt
in
lobsters
,
crabs
,
and
crawfish
;
and
I
afterwards
found
that
a
heap
of
these
creatures
,
in
a
state
of
wonderful
conglomeration
with
one
another
,
and
never
leaving
off
pinching
whatever
they
laid
hold
of
,
were
usually
to
be
found
in
a
little
wooden
outhouse
where
the
pots
and
kettles
were
kept
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
welcomed
by
a
very
civil
woman
in
a
white
apron
,
whom
I
had
seen
curtseying
at
the
door
when
I
was
on
Ham
's
back
,
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
.
 
<EOS>
Likewise
by
a
most
beautiful
little
girl
<EOS>
(
or
I
thought
her
so
)
with
a
necklace
of
blue
beads
on
,
who
would
n't
let
me
kiss
her
when
I
offered
to
,
but
ran
away
and
hid
herself
.
 
<EOS>
By
and
by
,
when
we
had
dined
in
a
sumptuous
manner
off
boiled
dabs
,
melted
butter
,
and
potatoes
,
with
a
chop
for
me
,
a
hairy
man
with
a
very
good
-
natured
face
came
home
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
called
Peggotty
"
Lass
"
,
and
gave
her
a
hearty
smack
on
the
cheek
,
I
had
no
doubt
,
from
the
general
propriety
of
her
conduct
,
that
he
was
her
brother
;
and
so
he
turned
out
---
<EOS>
being
presently
introduced
to
me
as
Mr
Peggotty
,
the
master
of
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
"
Glad
to
see
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
find
us
rough
,
sir
,
but
you
'll
find
us
ready
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
thanked
him
,
and
replied
that
I
was
sure
I
should
be
happy
in
such
a
delightful
place
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
's
your
Ma
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
leave
her
pretty
jolly
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
gave
Mr
Peggotty
to
understand
that
she
was
as
jolly
as
I
could
wish
,
and
that
she
desired
her
compliments
---
which
was
a
polite
fiction
on
my
part
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
much
obleeged
to
her
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
if
you
can
make
out
here
,
fur
a
fortnut
,
'
long
wi
'
her
,
"
nodding
at
his
sister
,
"
and
Ham
,
and
<EOS>
little
Em'ly
,
we
shall
be
proud
of
your
company
.
"
   
<EOS>
Having
done
the
honours
of
his
house
in
this
hospitable
manner
,
Mr
Peggotty
went
out
to
wash
himself
in
a
kettleful
of
hot
water
,
remarking
that
"
cold
would
never
get
his
muck
off
"
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
returned
,
greatly
improved
in
appearance
;
but
so
rubicund
,
that
I
could
n't
help
thinking
his
face
had
this
in
common
with
the
lobsters
,
crabs
,
and
crawfish
,
---
that
it
went
into
the
hot
water
very
black
,
and
came
out
very
red
.
   
<EOS>
After
tea
,
when
the
door
was
shut
and
all
was
made
snug
(
the
nights
being
cold
and
misty
now
)
,
it
seemed
to
me
the
most
delicious
retreat
that
the
imagination
of
man
could
conceive
.
 
<EOS>
To
hear
the
wind
getting
up
out
at
sea
,
to
know
that
the
fog
was
creeping
over
the
desolate
flat
outside
,
and
to
look
at
the
fire
,
and
think
that
there
was
no
house
near
but
this
one
,
and
this
one
a
boat
,
was
like
enchantment
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Em'ly
had
overcome
her
shyness
,
and
was
sitting
by
my
side
upon
the
lowest
and
least
of
the
lockers
,
which
was
just
large
enough
for
us
two
,
and
just
fitted
into
the
chimney
corner
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Peggotty
with
the
white
apron
,
was
knitting
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
at
her
needlework
was
as
much
at
home
with
St
Paul
's
and
the
bit
of
wax
-
candle
,
as
if
they
had
never
known
any
other
roof
.
 
<EOS>
Ham
,
who
had
been
giving
me
my
first
lesson
in
all
-
fours
,
was
trying
to
recollect
a
scheme
of
telling
fortunes
with
the
dirty
cards
,
and
was
printing
off
fishy
impressions
of
his
thumb
on
all
the
cards
he
turned
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
was
smoking
his
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
it
was
a
time
for
conversation
and
confidence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Peggotty
!
<EOS>
"
says
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
says
he
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
give
your
son
the
name
of
Ham
,
because
you
lived
in
a
sort
of
ark
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
seemed
to
think
it
a
deep
idea
,
but
answered
:
   
"
<EOS>
No
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
giv
him
no
name
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
gave
him
that
name
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
putting
question
number
two
of
the
catechism
to
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
his
father
giv
it
him
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
were
his
father
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
brother
Joe
was
his
father
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dead
,
Mr
Peggotty
?
<EOS>
"
I
hinted
,
after
a
respectful
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
Drowndead
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
very
much
surprised
that
Mr
Peggotty
was
not
Ham
's
father
,
and
began
to
wonder
whether
I
was
mistaken
about
his
relationship
to
anybody
else
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
curious
to
know
,
that
I
made
up
my
mind
to
have
it
out
with
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
Little
Em'ly
,
"
I
said
,
glancing
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
your
daughter
,
is
n't
she
,
Mr
Peggotty
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
My
brother
-
in
-
law
,
Tom
,
was
her
father
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
n't
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
---
Dead
,
Mr
Peggotty
?
<EOS>
"
I
hinted
,
after
another
respectful
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Drowndead
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
I
felt
the
difficulty
of
resuming
the
subject
,
but
had
not
got
to
the
bottom
of
it
yet
,
and
must
get
to
the
bottom
somehow
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Have
n't
you
ANY
children
,
Mr
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
master
,
"
he
answered
with
a
short
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
bacheldore
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
bachelor
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
astonished
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
who
's
that
,
Mr
Peggotty
?
"
<EOS>
pointing
to
the
person
in
the
apron
who
was
knitting
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
Missis
Gummidge
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gummidge
,
Mr
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
But
at
this
point
Peggotty
---
I
mean
my
own
peculiar
Peggotty
---
made
such
impressive
motions
to
me
not
to
ask
any
more
questions
,
that
I
could
only
sit
and
look
at
all
the
silent
company
,
until
it
was
time
to
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
in
the
privacy
of
my
own
little
cabin
,
she
informed
me
that
Ham
and
Em'ly
were
an
orphan
nephew
and
niece
,
whom
my
host
had
at
different
times
adopted
in
their
childhood
,
when
they
were
left
destitute
:
and
that
Mrs
Gummidge
was
the
widow
of
his
partner
in
a
boat
,
who
had
died
very
poor
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
but
<EOS>
a
poor
man
himself
,
said
Peggotty
,
but
as
good
as
gold
and
as
true
as
steel
---
those
were
her
similes
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
subject
,
she
informed
me
,
on
which
he
ever
showed
a
violent
temper
or
swore
an
oath
,
was
this
generosity
of
his
;
and
if
it
were
ever
referred
to
,
by
any
one
of
them
,
he
struck
the
table
a
heavy
blow
with
his
right
hand
(
had
split
it
on
one
such
occasion
)
,
and
swore
a
dreadful
oath
that
he
would
be
"
Gormed
"
if
he
did
n't
cut
and
run
for
good
,
if
it
was
ever
mentioned
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
appeared
,
in
answer
to
my
inquiries
,
that
nobody
had
the
least
idea
of
the
etymology
of
this
terrible
verb
passive
to
be
gormed
;
but
that
they
all
regarded
it
as
constituting
a
most
solemn
imprecation
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
very
sensible
of
my
entertainer
's
goodness
,
and
listened
to
the
women
's
going
to
bed
in
another
little
crib
like
mine
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
boat
,
and
to
him
and
Ham
hanging
up
two
hammocks
for
themselves
on
the
hooks
I
had
noticed
in
the
roof
,
in
a
very
luxurious
state
of
mind
,
enhanced
by
my
being
sleepy
.
 
<EOS>
As
slumber
gradually
stole
upon
me
,
I
heard
the
wind
howling
out
at
sea
and
coming
on
across
the
flat
so
fiercely
,
that
I
had
a
lazy
apprehension
of
the
great
deep
rising
in
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
bethought
myself
that
I
was
in
a
boat
,
after
all
;
and
that
a
man
like
Mr
Peggotty
was
not
a
bad
person
to
have
on
board
if
anything
did
happen
.
   
<EOS>
Nothing
happened
,
however
,
worse
than
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Almost
as
soon
as
it
shone
upon
the
oyster
-
shell
frame
of
my
mirror
I
was
out
of
bed
,
and
out
with
little
Em'ly
,
picking
up
stones
upon
the
beach
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
quite
a
sailor
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
to
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
I
supposed
anything
of
the
kind
,
but
I
felt
it
an
act
of
gallantry
to
say
something
;
and
a
shining
sail
close
to
us
made
such
a
pretty
little
image
of
itself
,
at
the
moment
,
in
her
bright
eye
,
that
it
came
into
my
head
to
say
this
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Em'ly
,
shaking
her
head
,
"
I
'm
afraid
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Afraid
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
with
a
becoming
air
of
boldness
,
and
looking
very
big
at
the
mighty
ocean
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
an't
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
but
it
's
cruel
,
"
said
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
it
very
cruel
to
some
of
our
men
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
it
tear
a
boat
as
big
as
our
house
,
all
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
was
n't
the
boat
<EOS>
that
---
"
   
"
That
father
was
drownded
in
?
"
said
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
one
,
I
never
see
that
boat
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
her
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Em'ly
shook
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
to
remember
!
"
   
<EOS>
Here
was
a
coincidence
!
 
<EOS>
I
immediately
went
into
an
explanation
how
I
had
never
seen
my
own
father
;
and
how
my
mother
and
I
had
always
lived
by
ourselves
in
the
happiest
state
imaginable
,
and
lived
so
then
,
and
always
meant
to
live
so
;
and
how
my
father
's
grave
was
in
the
churchyard
near
our
house
,
and
shaded
by
a
tree
,
beneath
the
boughs
of
which
I
had
walked
and
heard
the
birds
sing
many
a
pleasant
morning
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
were
some
differences
between
Em'ly
's
orphanhood
and
mine
,
it
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
lost
her
mother
before
her
father
;
and
where
her
father
's
grave
was
no
one
knew
,
except
that
it
was
somewhere
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
.
   
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
"
said
Em'ly
,
as
she
looked
about
for
shells
and
pebbles
,
"
your
father
was
a
gentleman
and
your
mother
is
a
lady
;
and
my
father
was
a
fisherman
and
my
mother
was
a
fisherman
's
daughter
,
and
my
uncle
Dan
is
a
fisherman
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dan
is
Mr
Peggotty
,
is
he
?
"
said
I.
   
"
Uncle
Dan
---
yonder
,
"
answered
Em'ly
,
nodding
at
the
boat
-
house
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
be
very
good
,
I
should
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
?
"
said
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
was
ever
to
be
a
lady
,
I
'd
give
him
a
sky
-
blue
coat
with
diamond
buttons
,
nankeen
trousers
,
a
red
velvet
waistcoat
,
a
cocked
hat
,
a
large
gold
watch
,
a
silver
pipe
,
and
a
box
of
money
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
said
I
had
no
doubt
that
Mr
Peggotty
well
deserved
these
treasures
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
acknowledge
that
I
felt
it
difficult
to
picture
him
quite
at
his
ease
in
the
raiment
proposed
for
him
by
his
grateful
little
niece
,
and
that
I
was
particularly
doubtful
of
the
policy
of
the
cocked
hat
;
but
I
kept
these
sentiments
to
myself
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Em'ly
had
stopped
and
looked
up
at
the
sky
in
her
enumeration
of
these
articles
,
as
if
they
were
a
glorious
vision
.
<EOS>
We
went
on
again
,
picking
up
shells
and
pebbles
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
like
to
be
a
lady
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
Emily
looked
at
me
,
and
laughed
and
nodded
"
yes
"
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
it
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
We
would
all
be
gentlefolks
together
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
Me
,
and
uncle
,
and
Ham
,
and
Mrs
Gummidge
.
 
<EOS>
We
would
n't
mind
then
,
when
there
comes
stormy
weather
.
 
<EOS>
---
Not
for
our
own
sakes
,
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
We
would
for
the
poor
fishermen
's
,
to
be
sure
,
and
we
'd
help
'em
with
money
when
they
come
to
any
hurt
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
very
satisfactory
and
therefore
not
at
all
improbable
picture
.
<EOS>
I
expressed
my
pleasure
in
the
contemplation
of
it
,
and
little
Em'ly
was
emboldened
to
say
,
shyly
,
   
"
Do
n't
you
think
you
are
afraid
of
the
sea
,
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
quiet
enough
to
reassure
me
,
but
I
have
no
doubt
if
I
had
seen
a
moderately
large
wave
come
tumbling
in
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
taken
to
my
heels
,
with
an
awful
recollection
of
her
drowned
relations
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
said
"
No
,
"
and
I
added
,
"
You
do
n't
seem
to
be
either
,
though
you
say
you
are
,
"
---
for
she
was
walking
much
too
near
the
brink
of
a
sort
of
old
jetty
or
wooden
causeway
we
had
strolled
upon
,
and
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
of
her
falling
over
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
afraid
in
this
way
,
"
said
little
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
wake
when
it
blows
,
and
tremble
to
think
of
Uncle
Dan
and
Ham
and
believe
I
hear
'em
crying
out
for
help
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
why
I
should
like
so
much
to
be
a
lady
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'm
not
afraid
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
Look
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
started
from
my
side
,
and
ran
along
a
jagged
timber
which
protruded
from
the
place
we
stood
upon
,
and
overhung
the
deep
water
at
some
height
,
without
the
least
defence
.
 
<EOS>
The
incident
is
so
impressed
on
my
remembrance
,
that
if
I
were
a
draughtsman
I
could
draw
its
form
here
,
I
dare
say
,
accurately
as
it
was
that
day
,
and
little
Em'ly
springing
forward
to
her
destruction
(
as
it
appeared
to
me
)
,
with
a
look
that
I
have
never
forgotten
,
directed
far
out
to
sea
.
   
<EOS>
The
light
,
bold
,
fluttering
little
figure
turned
and
came
back
safe
to
me
,
and
I
soon
laughed
at
my
fears
,
and
at
the
cry
I
had
uttered
;
fruitlessly
in
any
case
,
for
there
was
no
one
near
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
have
been
times
since
,
in
my
manhood
,
many
times
there
have
been
,
when
I
have
thought
<EOS>
,
Is
it
possible
,
among
the
possibilities
of
hidden
things
,
that
in
the
sudden
rashness
of
the
child
and
her
wild
look
so
far
off
,
there
was
any
merciful
attraction
of
her
into
danger
,
any
tempting
her
towards
him
permitted
on
the
part
of
her
dead
father
,
that
her
life
might
have
a
chance
of
ending
that
day
?
<EOS>
There
has
been
a
time
since
when
I
have
wondered
whether
,
if
the
life
before
her
could
have
been
revealed
to
me
at
a
glance
,
and
so
revealed
as
that
a
child
could
fully
comprehend
it
,
and
if
her
preservation
could
have
depended
on
a
motion
of
my
hand
,
I
ought
to
have
held
it
up
to
save
her
.
 
<EOS>
There
has
been
a
time
since
---
I
do
not
say
it
lasted
long
,
but
it
has
been
---
when
I
have
asked
myself
the
question
,
would
it
have
been
better
for
little
Em'ly
to
have
had
the
waters
close
above
her
head
that
morning
in
my
sight
;
and
when
I
have
answered
Yes
,
it
would
have
been
.
   
<EOS>
This
may
be
premature
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
set
it
down
too
soon
,
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
But
let
it
stand
.
   
<EOS>
We
strolled
a
long
way
,
and
loaded
ourselves
with
things
that
we
thought
curious
,
and
put
some
stranded
starfish
carefully
back
into
the
water
---
I
hardly
know
enough
of
the
race
at
this
moment
to
be
quite
certain
whether
they
had
reason
to
feel
obliged
to
us
for
doing
so
,
or
the
reverse
---
and
then
made
our
way
home
to
Mr
Peggotty
's
dwelling
.
 
<EOS>
We
stopped
under
the
lee
of
the
lobster
-
outhouse
to
exchange
an
innocent
kiss
,
and
went
in
to
breakfast
glowing
with
health
and
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
"
Like
two
young
mavishes
,
"
Mr
Peggotty
said
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
this
meant
,
in
our
local
dialect
,
like
two
young
thrushes
,
and
received
it
as
a
compliment
.
   
<EOS>
Of
course
I
was
in
love
with
little
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
loved
that
baby
quite
as
truly
,
quite
as
tenderly
,
with
greater
purity
and
more
disinterestedness
,
than
can
enter
into
the
best
love
of
a
later
time
of
life
,
high
and
ennobling
as
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
my
fancy
raised
up
something
round
that
blue
-
eyed
mite
of
a
child
,
which
etherealized
,
and
made
a
very
angel
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
any
sunny
forenoon
,
she
had
spread
a
little
pair
of
wings
and
flown
away
before
my
eyes
,
I
do
n't
think
I
should
have
regarded
it
as
much
more
than
I
had
had
reason
to
expect
.
   
<EOS>
We
used
to
walk
about
that
dim
old
flat
at
Yarmouth
in
a
loving
manner
,
hours
and
hours
.
 
<EOS>
The
days
sported
by
us
,
as
if
Time
had
not
grown
up
himself
yet
,
but
were
a
child
too
,
and
always
at
play
.
<EOS>
I
told
Em'ly
I
adored
her
,
and
that
unless
she
confessed
she
adored
me
<EOS>
I
should
be
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
killing
myself
with
a
sword
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
she
did
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
she
did
.
   
<EOS>
As
to
any
sense
of
inequality
,
or
youthfulness
,
or
other
difficulty
in
our
way
,
little
Em'ly
<EOS>
and
I
had
no
such
trouble
,
because
we
had
no
future
.
 
<EOS>
We
made
no
more
provision
for
growing
older
,
than
we
did
for
growing
younger
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
the
admiration
of
Mrs
Gummidge
and
Peggotty
,
who
used
to
whisper
of
an
evening
when
we
sat
,
lovingly
,
on
our
little
locker
side
by
side
,
"
Lor
!
<EOS>
was
n't
it
beautiful
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
smiled
at
us
from
behind
his
pipe
,
and
Ham
grinned
all
the
evening
and
did
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
something
of
the
sort
of
pleasure
in
us
,
I
suppose
,
that
they
might
have
had
in
a
pretty
toy
,
or
a
pocket
model
of
the
Colosseum
.
   
<EOS>
I
soon
found
out
that
Mrs
Gummidge
did
not
always
make
herself
so
agreeable
as
she
might
have
been
expected
to
do
,
under
the
circumstances
of
her
residence
with
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
's
was
rather
a
fretful
disposition
,
and
she
whimpered
more
sometimes
than
was
comfortable
for
other
parties
in
so
small
an
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
very
sorry
for
her
;
but
there
were
moments
when
it
would
have
been
more
agreeable
,
I
thought
,
if
Mrs
Gummidge
had
had
a
convenient
apartment
of
her
own
to
retire
to
,
and
had
stopped
there
until
her
spirits
revived
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
went
occasionally
to
a
public
-
house
called
The
Willing
Mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
discovered
this
,
by
his
being
out
on
the
second
or
third
evening
of
our
visit
,
and
by
Mrs
Gummidge
's
looking
up
at
the
Dutch
clock
,
between
eight
and
nine
,
and
saying
he
was
there
,
and
that
,
what
was
more
,
she
had
known
in
the
morning
he
would
go
there
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
had
been
in
a
low
state
all
day
,
and
had
burst
into
tears
in
the
forenoon
,
when
the
fire
smoked
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
lone
lorn
creetur
'
,
"
were
Mrs
Gummidge
's
words
,
when
that
unpleasant
occurrence
took
place
,
"
and
everythink
goes
contrary
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
'll
soon
leave
off
,
"
said
Peggotty
<EOS>
---
I
again
mean
our
Peggotty
---
"
and
besides
,
you
know
,
it
's
not
more
disagreeable
to
you
than
to
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
feel
it
more
,
"
said
Mrs
Gummidge
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
cold
day
,
with
cutting
blasts
of
wind
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
's
peculiar
corner
of
the
fireside
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
warmest
and
snuggest
in
the
place
,
as
her
chair
was
certainly
the
easiest
,
but
it
did
n't
suit
her
that
day
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
constantly
complaining
of
the
cold
,
and
of
its
occasioning
a
visitation
in
her
back
<EOS>
which
she
called
"
the
creeps
"
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
she
shed
tears
on
that
subject
,
and
said
again
that
she
was
"
a
lone
lorn
creetur
'
and
everythink
went
contrary
with
her
"
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
certainly
very
cold
,
"
said
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
Everybody
must
feel
it
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
feel
it
more
than
other
people
,
"
said
Mrs
Gummidge
.
   
<EOS>
So
at
dinner
;
when
Mrs
Gummidge
was
always
helped
immediately
after
me
,
to
whom
the
preference
was
given
as
a
visitor
of
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
The
fish
were
small
and
bony
,
and
the
potatoes
were
a
little
burnt
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
acknowledged
that
we
felt
this
something
of
a
disappointment
;
but
Mrs
Gummidge
said
she
felt
it
more
than
we
did
,
and
shed
tears
again
,
and
made
that
former
declaration
with
great
bitterness
.
   
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
when
Mr
Peggotty
came
home
about
nine
o'clock
,
this
unfortunate
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
was
knitting
in
her
corner
,
in
a
very
wretched
and
miserable
condition
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
had
been
working
cheerfully
.
 
<EOS>
Ham
had
been
patching
up
a
great
pair
of
waterboots
;
and
I
,
with
little
Em'ly
by
my
side
,
had
been
reading
to
them
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
had
never
made
any
other
remark
than
a
forlorn
sigh
,
and
had
never
raised
her
eyes
since
tea
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mates
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
taking
his
seat
,
"
and
how
are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
We
all
said
something
,
or
looked
something
,
to
welcome
him
,
except
Mrs
Gummidge
,
who
only
shook
her
head
over
her
knitting
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
amiss
?
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
with
a
clap
of
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"
Cheer
up
,
old
Mawther
!
"
 
<EOS>
(
Mr
Peggotty
meant
old
girl
.
)
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
did
not
appear
to
be
able
to
cheer
up
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
out
an
old
black
silk
handkerchief
and
wiped
her
eyes
;
but
instead
of
putting
it
in
her
pocket
,
kept
it
out
,
and
wiped
them
again
,
and
still
kept
it
out
,
ready
for
use
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
amiss
,
dame
?
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
returned
Mrs
Gummidge
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
come
from
The
Willing
Mind
,
Dan'l
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
yes
,
I
've
took
a
short
spell
at
The
Willing
Mind
tonight
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
I
should
drive
you
there
,
"
said
Mrs
Gummidge
.
   
<EOS>
"
Drive
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
no
driving
,
"
returned
Mr
Peggotty
with
an
honest
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
go
too
ready
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
ready
,
"
said
Mrs
Gummidge
,
shaking
her
head
,
and
wiping
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
very
ready
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
it
should
be
along
of
me
that
you
're
so
ready
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Along
o
'
you
!
 
<EOS>
It
an't
along
o

you

"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
ye
believe
a
bit
on
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
it
is
,
"
cried
Mrs
Gummidge
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
am
a
lone
lorn
creetur
'
,
and
not
only
that
everythink
goes
contrary
with
me
,
but
that
I
go
contrary
with
everybody
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
.
<EOS>
I
feel
more
than
other
people
do
,
and
I
show
it
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
my
misfortun
'
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
really
could
n't
help
thinking
,
as
I
sat
taking
in
all
this
,
that
the
misfortune
extended
to
some
other
members
of
that
family
besides
Mrs
Gummidge
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Peggotty
made
no
such
retort
,
only
answering
with
another
entreaty
to
Mrs
Gummidge
to
cheer
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
an't
what
I
could
wish
myself
to
be
,
"
said
Mrs
Gummidge
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
far
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
My
troubles
has
made
me
contrary
.
<EOS>
I
feel
my
troubles
,
and
they
make
me
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
did
n't
feel
'em
,
but
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
be
hardened
to
'em
,
but
<EOS>
I
an't
.
<EOS>
I
make
the
house
uncomfortable
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
wonder
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
made
your
sister
so
all
day
,
and
Master
Davy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Here
I
was
suddenly
melted
,
and
roared
out
,
"
<EOS>
No
,
you
have
n't
,
Mrs
Gummidge
,
"
in
great
mental
distress
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
far
from
right
that
I
should
do
it
,
"
said
Mrs
Gummidge
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
an't
a
fit
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
better
go
into
the
house
and
die
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
lone
lorn
creetur
'
,
and
had
much
better
not
make
myself
contrary
here
.
 
<EOS>
If
thinks
must
go
contrary
with
me
,
and
I
must
go
contrary
myself
,
let
me
go
contrary
in
my
parish
.
 
<EOS>
Dan'l
,
I
'd
better
go
into
the
house
,
and
die
and
be
a
riddance
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
retired
with
these
words
,
and
betook
herself
to
bed
.
<EOS>
When
she
was
gone
,
Mr
Peggotty
,
who
had
not
exhibited
a
trace
of
any
feeling
but
the
profoundest
sympathy
,
looked
round
upon
us
,
and
nodding
his
head
with
a
lively
expression
of
that
sentiment
still
animating
his
face
,
said
in
a
whisper
:
   
<EOS>
"
She
's
been
thinking
of
the
old
'
un
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
did
not
quite
understand
what
old
one
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
was
supposed
to
have
fixed
her
mind
upon
,
until
Peggotty
,
on
seeing
me
to
bed
,
explained
that
it
was
the
late
Mr
Gummidge
;
and
that
her
brother
always
took
that
for
a
received
truth
on
such
occasions
,
and
that
it
always
had
a
moving
effect
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
Some
time
after
he
was
in
his
hammock
that
night
,
I
heard
him
myself
repeat
to
Ham
,
"
Poor
thing
!
 
<EOS>
She
's
been
thinking
of
the
old
'
un
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
whenever
Mrs
Gummidge
was
overcome
in
a
similar
manner
during
the
remainder
of
our
stay
(
which
happened
some
few
times
)
,
he
always
said
the
same
thing
in
extenuation
of
the
circumstance
,
and
always
with
the
tenderest
commiseration
.
   
<EOS>
So
the
fortnight
slipped
away
,
varied
by
nothing
but
the
variation
of
the
tide
,
which
altered
Mr
Peggotty
's
times
of
going
out
and
coming
in
,
and
altered
Ham
's
engagements
also
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
latter
was
unemployed
,
he
sometimes
walked
with
us
to
show
us
the
boats
and
ships
,
and
once
or
twice
he
took
us
for
a
row
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
one
slight
set
of
impressions
should
be
more
particularly
associated
with
a
place
than
another
,
though
I
believe
this
obtains
with
most
people
,
in
reference
especially
to
the
associations
of
their
childhood
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
hear
the
name
,
or
read
the
name
,
of
Yarmouth
,
but
I
am
reminded
of
a
certain
Sunday
morning
on
the
beach
,
the
bells
ringing
for
church
,
little
Em'ly
leaning
on
my
shoulder
,
<EOS>
Ham
lazily
dropping
stones
into
the
water
,
and
the
sun
,
away
at
sea
,
just
breaking
through
the
heavy
mist
,
and
showing
us
the
ships
,
like
their
own
shadows
.
   
<EOS>
At
last
the
day
came
for
going
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
bore
up
against
the
separation
from
Mr
Peggotty
and
Mrs
Gummidge
,
but
my
agony
of
mind
at
leaving
little
Em'ly
was
piercing
.
 
<EOS>
We
went
arm
-
in
-
arm
to
the
public
-
house
where
the
carrier
put
up
,
and
I
promised
,
on
the
road
,
to
write
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
(
I
redeemed
that
promise
afterwards
,
in
characters
larger
than
those
in
which
apartments
are
usually
announced
in
manuscript
,
as
being
to
let
.
)
<EOS>
We
were
greatly
overcome
at
parting
;
and
if
ever
,
in
my
life
,
I
have
had
a
void
made
in
my
heart
,
I
had
one
made
that
day
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
all
the
time
I
had
been
on
my
visit
,
I
had
been
ungrateful
to
my
home
again
,
and
had
thought
little
or
nothing
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
no
sooner
turned
towards
it
,
than
my
reproachful
young
conscience
seemed
to
point
that
way
with
a
ready
finger
;
and
I
felt
,
all
the
more
for
the
sinking
of
my
spirits
,
that
it
was
my
nest
,
and
that
my
mother
was
my
comforter
and
friend
.
   
<EOS>
This
gained
upon
me
as
we
went
along
;
so
that
the
nearer
we
drew
,
the
more
familiar
the
objects
became
that
we
passed
,
<EOS>
the
more
excited
I
was
to
get
there
,
and
to
run
into
her
arms
.
 
<EOS>
But
Peggotty
,
instead
of
sharing
in
those
transports
,
tried
to
check
them
(
though
very
kindly
)
,
and
looked
confused
and
out
of
sorts
.
   
<EOS>
Blunderstone
Rookery
would
come
,
however
,
in
spite
of
her
,
when
the
carrier
's
horse
pleased
---
and
did
.
 
<EOS>
How
well
I
recollect
it
,
on
a
cold
grey
afternoon
,
with
a
dull
sky
,
threatening
rain
!
   
<EOS>
The
door
opened
,
and
I
looked
,
half
laughing
and
half
crying
in
my
pleasant
agitation
,
for
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
she
,
but
a
strange
servant
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Peggotty
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
said
,
ruefully
,
"
is
n't
she
come
home
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
Master
Davy
,
"
said
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
's
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
Wait
a
bit
,
Master
Davy
,
and
I
'll
<EOS>
---
I
'll
tell
you
something
.
"
   
<EOS>
Between
her
agitation
,
and
her
natural
awkwardness
in
getting
out
of
the
cart
,
Peggotty
was
making
a
most
extraordinary
festoon
of
herself
,
but
I
felt
too
blank
and
strange
to
tell
her
so
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
got
down
,
she
took
me
by
the
hand
;
led
me
,
wondering
,
into
the
kitchen
;
and
shut
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Peggotty
!
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
quite
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
's
the
matter
,
bless
you
,
Master
Davy
dear
!
"
<EOS>
she
answered
,
assuming
an
air
of
sprightliness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Something
's
the
matter
,
I
'm
sure
.
 
<EOS>
Where
's
mama
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
's
mama
,
Master
Davy
?
"
repeated
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Why
has
n't
she
come
out
to
the
gate
,
and
what
have
we
come
in
here
for
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Peggotty
!
"
 
<EOS>
My
eyes
were
full
,
and
I
felt
as
if
I
were
going
to
tumble
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
the
precious
boy
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Peggotty
,
taking
hold
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
Speak
,
my
pet
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
dead
,
too
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
she
's
not
dead
,
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
cried
out
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
with
an
astonishing
volume
of
voice
;
and
then
sat
down
,
and
began
to
pant
,
and
said
I
had
given
her
a
turn
.
   
<EOS>
I
gave
her
a
hug
to
take
away
the
turn
,
or
to
give
her
another
turn
in
the
right
direction
,
and
then
stood
before
her
,
looking
at
her
in
anxious
inquiry
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
dear
,
I
should
have
told
you
before
now
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
had
n't
an
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
made
it
,
perhaps
,
but
I
could
n't
azackly
"
---
that
was
always
the
substitute
for
exactly
,
in
Peggotty
's
militia
of
words
<EOS>
---
"
bring
my
mind
to
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
Peggotty
,
"
said
I
,
more
frightened
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
Master
Davy
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
untying
her
bonnet
with
a
shaking
hand
,
and
speaking
in
a
breathless
sort
of
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
got
a
Pa
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
trembled
,
and
turned
white
.
 
<EOS>
Something
---
I
do
n't
know
what
,
or
how
---
connected
with
the
grave
in
the
churchyard
,
and
the
raising
of
the
dead
,
seemed
to
strike
me
like
an
unwholesome
wind
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
new
one
,
"
said
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
new
one
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
gave
a
gasp
,
as
if
she
were
swallowing
something
that
was
very
hard
,
and
,
putting
out
her
hand
,
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Come
and
see
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
see
him
.
"
   
---
"
<EOS>
And
your
mama
,
"
said
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
I
ceased
to
draw
back
,
and
we
went
straight
to
the
best
parlour
,
where
she
left
me
.
 
<EOS>
On
one
side
of
the
fire
,
sat
my
mother
;
on
the
other
,
Mr
Murdstone
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
dropped
her
work
,
and
arose
hurriedly
,
but
timidly
I
thought
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Clara
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Recollect
!
control
yourself
,
always
control
yourself
!
 
<EOS>
Davy
boy
,
how
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
gave
him
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
moment
of
suspense
,
I
went
and
kissed
my
mother
:
she
kissed
me
,
patted
me
gently
on
the
shoulder
,
and
sat
down
again
to
her
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
look
at
her
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
look
at
him
,
I
knew
quite
well
that
he
was
looking
at
us
both
;
and
I
turned
to
the
window
and
looked
out
there
,
at
some
shrubs
that
were
drooping
their
heads
in
the
cold
.
   
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
could
creep
away
,
I
crept
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
My
old
dear
bedroom
was
changed
,
and
I
was
to
lie
a
long
way
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
rambled
downstairs
to
find
anything
that
was
like
itself
,
so
altered
it
all
seemed
;
and
roamed
into
the
yard
.
 
<EOS>
I
very
soon
started
back
from
there
,
for
the
empty
dog
-
kennel
was
filled
up
with
a
great
dog
---
deep
mouthed
and
black
-
haired
like
Him
---
and
he
was
very
angry
at
the
sight
of
me
,
and
sprang
out
to
get
at
me
.

Chapter

<EOS>
I
Fall
into
Disgrace
 
<EOS>
If
the
room
to
which
my
bed
was
removed
were
a
sentient
thing
that
could
give
evidence
,
I
might
appeal
to
it
at
this
day
---
who
sleeps
there
now
,
I
wonder
!
<EOS>
---
to
bear
witness
for
me
what
a
heavy
heart
I
carried
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
up
there
,
hearing
the
dog
in
the
yard
bark
after
me
all
the
way
while
I
climbed
the
stairs
;
and
,
looking
as
blank
and
strange
upon
the
room
as
the
room
looked
upon
me
,
sat
down
with
my
small
hands
crossed
,
and
thought
.
   
<EOS>
I
thought
of
the
oddest
things
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
shape
of
the
room
,
of
the
cracks
in
the
ceiling
,
of
the
paper
on
the
walls
,
of
the
flaws
in
the
window
-
glass
making
ripples
and
dimples
on
the
prospect
,
of
the
washing
-
stand
being
rickety
on
its
three
legs
,
and
having
a
discontented
something
about
it
,
which
reminded
me
of
Mrs
Gummidge
under
the
influence
of
the
old
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
crying
all
the
time
,
but
,
except
that
I
was
conscious
of
being
cold
and
dejected
,
I
am
sure
I
never
thought
why
I
cried
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
in
my
desolation
I
began
to
consider
that
I
was
dreadfully
in
love
with
little
Em'ly
,
and
had
been
torn
away
from
her
to
come
here
where
no
one
seemed
to
want
me
,
or
to
care
about
me
,
half
as
much
as
she
did
.
 
<EOS>
This
made
such
a
very
miserable
piece
of
business
of
it
,
that
I
rolled
myself
up
in
a
corner
of
the
counterpane
,
and
cried
myself
to
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
awoke
by
somebody
saying
"
Here
he
is
!
"
and
uncovering
my
hot
head
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
and
Peggotty
had
come
to
look
for
me
,
and
it
was
one
of
them
who
had
done
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Davy
,
"
said
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
very
strange
that
she
should
ask
me
,
and
answered
,
"
Nothing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
turned
over
on
my
face
,
I
recollect
,
to
hide
my
trembling
lip
,
which
answered
her
with
greater
truth
.
<EOS>
"
Davy
,
"
said
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
Davy
,
my
child
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
dare
say
no
words
she
could
have
uttered
would
have
affected
me
so
much
,
then
,
as
her
calling
me
her
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
hid
my
tears
in
the
bedclothes
,
and
pressed
her
from
me
with
my
hand
,
when
she
would
have
raised
me
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
your
doing
,
Peggotty
,
you
cruel
thing
!
"
said
my
mother
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
at
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
How
can
you
reconcile
it
to
your
conscience
,
I
wonder
,
to
prejudice
my
own
boy
against
me
,
or
against
anybody
who
is
dear
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
by
it
,
Peggotty
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Poor
Peggotty
lifted
up
her
hands
and
eyes
,
and
only
answered
,
in
a
sort
of
paraphrase
of
the
grace
I
usually
repeated
after
dinner
,
"
Lord
forgive
you
,
Mrs
Copperfield
,
and
for
what
you
have
said
this
minute
,
may
you
never
be
truly
sorry
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
enough
to
distract
me
,
"
cried
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
my
honeymoon
,
too
,
when
my
most
inveterate
enemy
might
relent
,
one
would
think
,
and
not
envy
me
a
little
peace
of
mind
and
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
Davy
<EOS>
,
you
naughty
boy
!
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
,
you
savage
creature
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
dear
me
!
"
cried
my
mother
,
turning
from
one
of
us
to
the
other
,
in
her
pettish
wilful
manner
,
"
what
a
troublesome
world
this
is
,
when
one
has
the
most
right
to
expect
it
to
be
as
agreeable
as
possible
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
felt
the
touch
of
a
hand
that
I
knew
was
neither
hers
nor
Peggotty
's
,
and
slipped
to
my
feet
at
the
bed
-
side
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Mr
Murdstone
's
hand
,
and
he
kept
it
on
my
arm
as
he
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
this
?
 
<EOS>
Clara
,
my
love
,
have
you
forgotten
?
<EOS>
---
Firmness
,
my
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
,
Edward
,
"
said
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
meant
to
be
very
good
,
but
I
am
so
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
he
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
bad
hearing
,
so
soon
,
Clara
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
it
's
very
hard
<EOS>
I
should
be
made
so
now
,
"
returned
my
mother
,
pouting
;
"
and
it
is
---
very
hard
---
is
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
drew
her
to
him
,
whispered
in
her
ear
,
and
kissed
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
as
well
,
when
I
saw
my
mother
's
head
lean
down
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
her
arm
touch
his
neck
---
<EOS>
I
knew
as
well
that
he
could
mould
her
pliant
nature
into
any
form
he
chose
,
as
I
know
,
now
,
that
he
did
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
you
below
,
my
love
,
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
.
 
<EOS>
"
David
and
I
will
come
down
,
together
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
,
"
turning
a
darkening
face
on
Peggotty
,
when
he
had
watched
my
mother
out
,
and
dismissed
her
with
a
nod
and
a
smile
;
"
do
you
know
your
mistress
's
name
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
has
been
my
mistress
a
long
time
,
sir
,
"
answered
Peggotty
,
"
I
ought
to
know
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
"
he
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
thought
I
heard
you
,
as
I
came
upstairs
,
address
her
by
a
name
that
is
not
hers
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
taken
mine
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
remember
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
,
with
some
uneasy
glances
at
me
,
curtseyed
herself
out
of
the
room
without
replying
;
seeing
,
I
suppose
,
that
she
was
expected
to
go
,
and
had
no
excuse
for
remaining
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
two
were
left
alone
,
he
shut
the
door
,
and
sitting
on
a
chair
,
and
holding
me
standing
before
him
,
looked
steadily
into
my
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
my
own
attracted
,
no
less
steadily
,
to
his
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
recall
our
being
opposed
thus
,
face
to
face
,
I
seem
again
to
hear
my
heart
beat
fast
and
high
.
   
<EOS>
"
David
,
"
he
said
,
making
his
lips
thin
,
by
pressing
them
together
,
"
if
I
have
an
obstinate
horse
or
dog
to
deal
with
,
what
do
you
think
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beat
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
had
answered
in
a
kind
of
breathless
whisper
,
but
I
felt
,
in
my
silence
,
that
my
breath
was
shorter
now
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
make
him
wince
,
and
smart
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
to
myself
,
"
I
'll
conquer
that
fellow
"
;
and
if
it
were
to
cost
him
all
the
blood
he
had
,
I
should
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
that
upon
your
face
?
"
   
"
Dirt
,
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
He
knew
it
was
the
mark
of
tears
as
well
as
I.
 
<EOS>
But
if
he
had
asked
the
question
twenty
times
,
each
time
with
twenty
blows
,
I
believe
my
baby
heart
would
have
burst
before
I
would
have
told
him
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
good
deal
of
intelligence
for
a
little
fellow
,
"
he
said
,
with
a
grave
smile
that
belonged
to
him
,
"
and
you
understood
me
very
well
<EOS>
,
I
see
.
 
<EOS>
Wash
that
face
,
sir
,
and
come
down
with
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
pointed
to
the
washing
-
stand
,
which
I
had
made
out
to
be
like
Mrs
Gummidge
,
and
motioned
me
with
his
head
to
obey
him
directly
.
<EOS>
I
had
little
doubt
then
,
and
I
have
less
doubt
now
,
that
he
would
have
knocked
me
down
without
the
least
compunction
,
if
I
had
hesitated
.
   
<EOS>
"
Clara
,
my
dear
,
"
he
said
,
when
I
had
done
his
bidding
,
and
he
walked
me
into
the
parlour
,
with
his
hand
still
on
my
arm
;
"
you
will
not
be
made
uncomfortable
any
more
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
soon
improve
our
youthful
humours
.
"
   
<EOS>
God
help
me
,
I
might
have
been
improved
for
my
whole
life
,
I
might
have
been
made
another
creature
perhaps
,
for
life
,
by
a
kind
word
at
that
season
.
 
<EOS>
A
word
of
encouragement
and
explanation
,
of
pity
for
my
childish
ignorance
,
of
welcome
home
,
of
reassurance
to
me
that
it
was
home
,
might
have
made
me
dutiful
to
him
in
my
heart
henceforth
,
instead
of
in
my
hypocritical
outside
,
and
might
have
made
me
respect
instead
of
hate
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
my
mother
was
sorry
to
see
me
standing
in
the
room
<EOS>
so
scared
and
strange
,
and
that
,
presently
,
when
I
stole
to
a
chair
,
she
followed
me
with
her
eyes
more
sorrowfully
still
---
missing
,
perhaps
,
some
freedom
in
my
childish
tread
---
but
the
word
was
not
spoken
,
and
the
time
for
it
was
gone
.
   
<EOS>
We
dined
alone
,
<EOS>
we
three
together
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
very
fond
of
my
mother
<EOS>
---
I
am
afraid
I
liked
him
none
the
better
for
that
---
and
she
was
very
fond
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
gathered
from
what
they
said
,
that
an
elder
sister
of
his
was
coming
to
stay
with
them
,
and
that
she
was
expected
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
certain
whether
I
found
out
then
,
or
afterwards
,
that
,
without
being
actively
concerned
in
any
business
,
he
had
some
share
in
,
or
some
annual
charge
upon
the
profits
of
,
a
wine
-
merchant
's
house
in
London
,
with
which
his
family
had
been
connected
from
his
great
-
grandfather
's
time
,
and
in
which
his
sister
had
a
similar
interest
;
but
I
may
mention
it
in
this
place
,
whether
or
no
.
   
<EOS>
After
dinner
,
when
we
were
sitting
by
the
fire
,
and
I
was
meditating
an
escape
to
Peggotty
without
having
the
hardihood
to
slip
away
,
lest
it
should
offend
the
master
of
the
house
,
a
coach
drove
up
to
the
garden
-
gate
and
he
went
out
to
receive
the
visitor
.
<EOS>
My
mother
followed
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
timidly
following
her
,
when
she
turned
round
at
the
parlour
door
,
in
the
dusk
,
and
taking
me
in
her
embrace
as
she
had
been
used
to
do
<EOS>
,
whispered
me
to
love
my
new
father
and
be
obedient
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
this
hurriedly
and
secretly
,
as
if
it
were
wrong
,
but
tenderly
;
and
,
putting
out
her
hand
behind
her
,
held
mine
in
it
,
until
we
came
near
to
where
he
was
standing
in
the
garden
,
where
she
let
mine
go
,
and
drew
hers
through
his
arm
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
Miss
Murdstone
who
was
arrived
,
and
a
gloomy
-
looking
lady
she
was
;
dark
,
like
her
brother
,
whom
she
greatly
resembled
in
face
and
voice
;
and
with
very
heavy
eyebrows
,
nearly
meeting
over
her
large
nose
,
as
if
,
being
disabled
by
the
wrongs
of
her
sex
from
wearing
whiskers
,
she
had
carried
them
to
that
account
.
 
<EOS>
She
brought
with
her
two
uncompromising
hard
black
boxes
,
with
her
initials
on
the
lids
in
hard
brass
nails
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
paid
the
coachman
she
took
her
money
out
of
a
hard
steel
purse
,
and
she
kept
the
purse
in
a
very
jail
of
a
bag
which
hung
upon
her
arm
by
a
heavy
chain
,
and
shut
up
like
a
bite
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
never
,
at
that
time
,
seen
such
a
metallic
lady
altogether
as
Miss
Murdstone
was
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
brought
into
the
parlour
with
many
tokens
of
welcome
,
and
there
formally
recognized
my
mother
as
a
new
and
near
relation
.
<EOS>
Then
she
looked
at
me
,
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Is
that
your
boy
,
sister
-
in
-
law
?
"
   
<EOS>
My
mother
acknowledged
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Generally
speaking
,
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
"
I
do
n't
like
boys
.
 
<EOS>
How
d'ye
do
,
boy
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Under
these
encouraging
circumstances
,
I
replied
that
I
was
very
well
,
and
that
I
hoped
she
was
the
same
;
with
such
an
indifferent
grace
,
that
Miss
Murdstone
disposed
of
me
in
two
words
:
   
"
<EOS>
Wants
manner
!
"
   
<EOS>
Having
uttered
which
,
with
great
distinctness
,
she
begged
the
favour
of
being
shown
to
her
room
,
which
became
to
me
from
that
time
forth
a
place
of
awe
and
dread
,
wherein
the
two
black
boxes
were
never
seen
open
or
known
to
be
left
unlocked
,
and
where
(
for
I
peeped
in
once
or
twice
when
she
was
out
)
numerous
little
steel
fetters
and
rivets
,
with
which
Miss
Murdstone
embellished
herself
when
she
was
dressed
,
generally
hung
upon
the
looking
-
glass
in
formidable
array
.
   
<EOS>
As
well
as
I
could
make
out
,
she
had
come
for
good
,
and
had
no
intention
of
ever
going
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
began
to
"
help
"
my
mother
next
morning
,
and
was
in
and
out
of
the
store
-
closet
all
day
,
putting
things
to
rights
,
and
making
havoc
in
the
old
arrangements
.
 
<EOS>
Almost
the
first
remarkable
thing
I
observed
in
Miss
Murdstone
was
,
her
being
constantly
haunted
by
a
suspicion
that
the
servants
had
a
man
secreted
somewhere
on
the
premises
.
 
<EOS>
Under
the
influence
of
this
delusion
,
she
dived
into
the
coal
-
cellar
at
the
most
untimely
hours
,
and
scarcely
ever
opened
the
door
of
a
dark
cupboard
without
clapping
it
to
again
,
in
the
belief
that
she
had
got
him
.
   
<EOS>
Though
there
was
nothing
very
airy
about
Miss
Murdstone
,
she
was
a
perfect
Lark
in
point
of
getting
up
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
up
(
and
,
as
I
believe
to
this
hour
,
looking
for
that
man
)
before
anybody
in
the
house
was
stirring
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
gave
it
as
her
opinion
that
she
even
slept
with
one
eye
open
;
but
I
could
not
concur
in
this
idea
;
for
I
tried
it
myself
after
hearing
the
suggestion
thrown
out
,
and
found
it
could
n't
be
done
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
very
first
morning
after
her
arrival
she
was
up
and
ringing
her
bell
at
cock
-
crow
.
 
<EOS>
When
my
mother
came
down
to
breakfast
and
was
going
to
make
the
tea
,
Miss
Murdstone
gave
her
a
kind
of
peck
on
the
cheek
,
which
was
her
nearest
approach
to
a
kiss
,
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Now
,
Clara
,
my
dear
,
I
am
come
here
,
you
know
,
to
relieve
you
of
all
the
trouble
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
much
too
pretty
and
thoughtless
"
---
my
mother
blushed
but
laughed
,
and
seemed
not
to
dislike
this
character
---
"
to
have
any
duties
imposed
upon
you
that
can
be
undertaken
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
'll
be
so
good
as
give
me
your
keys
,
my
dear
,
I
'll
attend
to
all
this
sort
of
thing
in
future
.
"
   
<EOS>
From
that
time
,
Miss
Murdstone
kept
the
keys
in
her
own
little
jail
all
day
,
and
under
her
pillow
all
night
,
and
my
mother
had
no
more
to
do
with
them
than
I
had
.
   
<EOS>
My
mother
did
not
suffer
her
authority
to
pass
from
her
without
a
shadow
of
protest
.
 
<EOS>
One
night
when
Miss
Murdstone
had
been
developing
certain
household
plans
to
her
brother
,
of
which
he
signified
his
approbation
,
my
mother
suddenly
began
to
cry
,
and
said
she
thought
she
might
have
been
consulted
.
   
<EOS>
"
Clara
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
sternly

<EOS>
"
Clara
!
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
at
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
very
well
to
say
you
wonder
,
Edward
!
"
<EOS>
cried
my
mother
,
"
and
it
's
very
well
for
you
to
talk
about
firmness
,
but
you
would
n't
like
it
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
Firmness
,
I
may
observe
,
was
the
grand
quality
on
which
both
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
took
their
stand
.
 
<EOS>
However
I
might
have
expressed
my
comprehension
of
it
at
that
time
,
if
I
had
been
called
upon
,
I
nevertheless
did
clearly
comprehend
in
my
own
way
,
that
it
was
another
name
for
tyranny
;
and
for
a
certain
gloomy
,
arrogant
,
devil
's
humour
,
that
was
in
them
both
.
 
<EOS>
The
creed
,
as
I
should
state
it
now
,
was
this
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Murdstone
was
firm
;
nobody
in
his
world
was
to
be
so
firm
as
Mr
Murdstone
;
nobody
else
in
his
world
was
to
be
firm
at
all
,
for
everybody
was
to
be
bent
to
his
firmness
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
was
an
exception
.
 
<EOS>
She
might
be
firm
,
but
only
by
relationship
,
and
in
an
inferior
and
tributary
degree
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
was
another
exception
.
 
<EOS>
She
might
be
firm
,
and
must
be
;
but
only
in
bearing
their
firmness
,
and
firmly
believing
there
was
no
other
firmness
upon
earth
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
hard
,
"
said
my
mother
,
"
that
in
my
own
house
---
"
   
"
My
own
house
?
"
<EOS>
repeated
Mr
Murdstone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Clara
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
OUR
own
house
,
I
mean
,
"
faltered
my
mother
,
evidently
frightened
---
"
<EOS>
I
hope
you
must
know
what
I
mean
,
Edward
<EOS>
---
it
's
very
hard
that
in
YOUR
own
house
I
may
not
have
a
word
to
say
about
domestic
matters
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
managed
very
well
before
we
were
married
.
<EOS>
There
's
evidence
,
"
said
my
mother
,
sobbing
;
"
ask
Peggotty
if
I
did
n't
do
very
well
when
I
was
n't
interfered
with
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Edward
,
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
"
let
there
be
an
end
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Jane
Murdstone
,
"
said
her
brother
,
"
be
silent
!
 
<EOS>
How
dare
you
to
insinuate
that
you
do
n't
know
my
character
better
than
your
words
imply
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
"
my
poor
mother
went
on
,
at
a
grievous
disadvantage
,
and
with
many
tears
,
"
I
do
n't
want
anybody
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
very
miserable
and
unhappy
if
anybody
was
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
ask
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
unreasonable
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
want
to
be
consulted
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
anybody
who
assists
me
,
and
I
only
want
to
be
consulted
as
a
mere
form
,
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
were
pleased
,
once
,
with
my
being
a
little
inexperienced
and
girlish
,
Edward
<EOS>
---
I
am
sure
you
said
so
---
but
you
seem
to
hate
me
for
it
now
,
you
are
so
severe
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Edward
,
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
again
,
"
let
there
be
an
end
of
this
.
<EOS>
I
go
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Jane
Murdstone
,
"
thundered
Mr
Murdstone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
be
silent
?
<EOS>
How
dare
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
made
a
jail
-
delivery
of
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
and
held
it
before
her
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Clara
,
"
he
continued
,
looking
at
my
mother
,
"
you
surprise
me
!
 
<EOS>
You
astound
me
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
had
a
satisfaction
in
the
thought
of
marrying
an
inexperienced
and
artless
person
,
and
forming
her
character
,
and
infusing
into
it
some
amount
of
that
firmness
and
decision
of
which
it
stood
in
need
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
Jane
Murdstone
is
kind
enough
to
come
to
my
assistance
in
this
endeavour
,
and
to
assume
,
for
my
sake
,
a
condition
something
like
a
housekeeper
's
,
and
when
she
meets
with
a
base
return
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
pray
,
pray
,
Edward
,
"
cried
my
mother
,
"
do
n't
accuse
me
of
being
ungrateful
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
am
not
ungrateful
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
ever
said
I
was
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
many
faults
,
but
not
that
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
do
n't
,
my
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
Jane
Murdstone
meets
,
I
say
,
"
he
went
on
,
after
waiting
until
my
mother
was
silent
,
"
with
a
base
return
,
that
feeling
of
mine
is
chilled
and
altered
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
n't
,
my
love
,
say
that
!
"
<EOS>
implored
my
mother
very
piteously
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
,
Edward
!
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
I
am
,
I
am
affectionate
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
am
affectionate
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
say
it
,
if
I
was
n't
sure
that
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
Ask
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
'll
tell
you
<EOS>
I
'm
affectionate
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
extent
of
mere
weakness
,
Clara
,
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
in
reply
,
"
that
can
have
the
least
weight
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
lose
breath
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
let
us
be
friends
,
"
said
my
mother
,
"
I
could
n't
live
under
coldness
or
unkindness
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
sorry
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
many
defects
,
I
know
,
and
it
's
very
good
of
you
,
Edward
,
with
your
strength
of
mind
,
to
endeavour
to
correct
them
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Jane
,
I
do
n't
object
to
anything
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
quite
broken
-
hearted
if
you
thought
of
leaving
---
<EOS>
"
My
mother
was
too
much
overcome
to
go
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jane
Murdstone
,
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
to
his
sister
,
"
any
harsh
words
between
us
are
,
I
hope
,
uncommon
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
my
fault
that
so
unusual
an
occurrence
has
taken
place
tonight
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
betrayed
into
it
by
another
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
is
it
your
fault
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
betrayed
into
it
by
another
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
both
try
to
forget
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
this
,
"
he
added
,
after
these
magnanimous
words
,
"
is
not
a
fit
scene
for
the
boy
---
David
,
go
to
bed
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
find
the
door
,
through
the
tears
that
stood
in
my
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
sorry
for
my
mother
's
distress
;
but
I
groped
my
way
out
,
and
groped
my
way
up
to
my
room
in
the
dark
,
without
even
having
the
heart
to
say
good
night
to
Peggotty
,
or
to
get
a
candle
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
When
her
coming
up
to
look
for
me
,
an
hour
or
so
afterwards
,
awoke
me
,
she
said
that
my
mother
had
gone
to
bed
poorly
,
and
that
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
were
sitting
alone
.
   
<EOS>
Going
down
next
morning
rather
earlier
than
usual
,
I
paused
outside
the
parlour
door
,
on
hearing
my
mother
's
voice
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
very
earnestly
and
humbly
entreating
Miss
Murdstone
's
pardon
,
which
that
lady
granted
,
and
a
perfect
reconciliation
took
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
knew
my
mother
afterwards
to
give
an
opinion
on
any
matter
,
without
first
appealing
to
Miss
Murdstone
,
or
without
having
first
ascertained
by
some
sure
means
,
what
Miss
Murdstone
's
opinion
was
;
and
I
never
saw
Miss
Murdstone
<EOS>
,
when
out
of
temper
(
she
was
infirm
that
way
)
,
move
her
hand
towards
her
bag
as
if
she
were
going
to
take
out
the
keys
and
offer
to
resign
them
to
my
mother
,
without
seeing
that
my
mother
was
in
a
terrible
fright
.
   
<EOS>
The
gloomy
taint
that
was
in
the
Murdstone
blood
,
darkened
the
Murdstone
religion
,
which
was
austere
and
wrathful
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
thought
,
since
,
that
its
assuming
that
character
was
a
necessary
consequence
of
Mr
Murdstone
's
firmness
,
which
would
n't
allow
him
to
let
anybody
off
from
the
utmost
weight
of
the
severest
penalties
he
could
find
any
excuse
for
.
 
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
<EOS>
,
I
well
remember
the
tremendous
visages
with
which
we
used
to
go
to
church
,
and
the
changed
air
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
Again
,
the
dreaded
Sunday
comes
round
,
and
I
file
into
the
old
pew
first
,
like
a
guarded
captive
brought
to
a
condemned
service
.
 
<EOS>
Again
,
Miss
Murdstone
,
in
a
black
velvet
gown
,
that
looks
as
if
it
had
been
made
out
of
a
pall
,
follows
close
upon
me
;
then
my
mother
;
then
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
Peggotty
now
,
as
in
the
old
time
.
 
<EOS>
Again
,
I
listen
to
Miss
Murdstone
mumbling
the
responses
,
and
emphasizing
all
the
dread
words
with
a
cruel
relish
.
 
<EOS>
Again
,
I
see
her
dark
eyes
roll
round
the
church
when
she
says
"
miserable
sinners
"
,
as
if
she
were
calling
all
the
congregation
names
.
 
<EOS>
Again
,
I
catch
rare
glimpses
of
my
mother
,
moving
her
lips
timidly
between
the
two
,
with
one
of
them
muttering
at
each
ear
like
low
thunder
.
 
<EOS>
Again
,
I
wonder
with
a
sudden
fear
whether
it
is
likely
that
our
good
old
clergyman
can
be
wrong
,
and
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
right
,
and
that
all
the
angels
in
Heaven
can
be
destroying
angels
.
 
<EOS>
Again
,
if
I
move
a
finger
or
relax
a
muscle
of
my
face
,
Miss
Murdstone
pokes
me
with
her
prayer
-
book
,
and
makes
my
side
ache
.
   
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
again
,
as
we
walk
home
,
I
note
some
neighbours
looking
at
my
mother
and
at
me
,
and
whispering
.
 
<EOS>
Again
,
as
the
three
go
on
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
and
I
linger
behind
alone
<EOS>
,
I
follow
some
of
those
looks
,
and
wonder
if
my
mother
's
step
be
really
not
so
light
as
I
have
seen
it
,
and
if
the
gaiety
of
her
beauty
be
really
almost
worried
away
.
 
<EOS>
Again
,
I
wonder
whether
any
of
the
neighbours
call
to
mind
,
as
I
do
,
how
we
used
to
walk
home
together
,
she
and
I
;
and
I
wonder
stupidly
about
that
,
all
the
dreary
dismal
day
.
   
<EOS>
There
had
been
some
talk
on
occasions
of
my
going
to
boarding
-
school
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
had
originated
it
,
and
my
mother
had
of
course
agreed
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
,
however
,
was
concluded
on
the
subject
yet
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
I
learnt
lessons
at
home
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
ever
forget
those
lessons
!
 
<EOS>
They
were
presided
over
nominally
by
my
mother
,
but
really
by
Mr
Murdstone
and
his
sister
,
who
were
always
present
,
and
found
them
a
favourable
occasion
for
giving
my
mother
lessons
in
that
miscalled
firmness
,
which
was
the
bane
of
both
our
lives
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
was
kept
at
home
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
been
apt
enough
to
learn
,
and
willing
enough
,
when
my
mother
and
I
had
lived
alone
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
faintly
remember
learning
the
alphabet
at
her
knee
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
day
,
when
I
look
upon
the
fat
black
letters
in
the
primer
,
the
puzzling
novelty
of
their
shapes
,
and
the
easy
good
-
nature
of
O^
and
Q^
and
S^
,
seem
to
present
themselves
again
before
me
as
they
used
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
recall
no
feeling
of
disgust
or
reluctance
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
I
seem
to
have
walked
along
a
path
of
flowers
as
far
as
the
crocodile
-
book
,
and
to
have
been
cheered
by
the
gentleness
of
my
mother
's
voice
and
manner
all
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
But
these
solemn
lessons
which
succeeded
those
<EOS>
,
I
remember
as
the
death
-
blow
of
my
peace
,
and
a
grievous
daily
drudgery
and
misery
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
very
long
,
very
numerous
,
very
hard
---
perfectly
unintelligible
,
some
of
them
,
to
me
---
and
I
was
generally
as
much
bewildered
by
them
as
I
believe
my
poor
mother
was
herself
.
   
<EOS>
Let
me
remember
how
it
used
to
be
,
and
bring
one
morning
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
I
come
into
the
second
-
best
parlour
after
breakfast
,
with
my
books
,
and
an
exercise
-
book
,
and
a
slate
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
is
ready
for
me
at
her
writing
-
desk
,
but
not
half
so
ready
as
Mr
Murdstone
in
his
easy
-
chair
by
the
window
(
though
he
pretends
to
be
reading
a
book
)
,
or
as
Miss
Murdstone
,
sitting
near
my
mother
stringing
steel
beads
.
<EOS>
The
very
sight
of
these
two
has
such
an
influence
over
me
,
that
I
begin
to
feel
the
words
I
have
been
at
infinite
pains
to
get
into
my
head
,
all
sliding
away
,
and
going
I
do
n't
know
where
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
where
they
do
go
,
by
the
by
?
   
<EOS>
I
hand
the
first
book
to
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
is
a
grammar
,
perhaps
a
history
,
or
geography
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
<EOS>
a
last
drowning
look
at
the
page
as
I
give
it
into
her
hand
,
and
start
off
aloud
at
a
racing
pace
while
I
have
got
it
fresh
.
 
<EOS>
I
trip
over
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Murdstone
looks
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
trip
over
another
word
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
looks
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
redden
,
tumble
over
half
-
a
-
dozen
words
,
and
stop
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
my
mother
would
show
me
the
book
if
she
dared
,
but
she
does
not
dare
,
and
<EOS>
she
says
softly
:
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Davy
,
Davy
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Clara
,
"
says
Mr
Murdstone
,
"
be
firm
with
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
say
,
"
Oh
,
Davy
,
Davy
!
"
 
<EOS>
That
's
childish
.
 
<EOS>
He
knows
his
lesson
,
or
he
does
not
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
does
NOT
know
it
,
"
Miss
Murdstone
interposes
awfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
really
afraid
he
does
not
,
"
says
my
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
you
see
,
Clara
,
"
returns
Miss
Murdstone
,
"
you
should
just
give
him
the
book
back
,
and
make
him
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
certainly
,
"
says
my
mother
;
"
that
is
what
I
intend
to
do
,
my
dear
Jane
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Davy
,
try
once
more
,
and
do
n't
be
stupid
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
obey
the
first
clause
of
the
injunction
by
trying
once
more
,
but
am
not
so
successful
with
the
second
,
for
I
am
very
stupid
.
 
<EOS>
I
tumble
down
before
I
get
to
the
old
place
,
at
a
point
where
I
was
all
right
before
,
and
stop
to
think
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
think
about
the
lesson
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
of
the
number
of
yards
of
net
in
Miss
Murdstone
's
cap
,
or
of
the
price
of
Mr
Murdstone
's
dressing
-
gown
,
or
any
such
ridiculous
problem
that
I
have
no
business
with
,
and
do
n't
want
to
have
anything
at
all
to
do
with
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Murdstone
makes
a
movement
of
impatience
which
I
have
been
expecting
for
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
does
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
glances
submissively
at
them
,
shuts
the
book
,
and
lays
it
by
as
an
arrear
to
be
worked
out
when
my
other
tasks
are
done
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
a
pile
of
these
arrears
very
soon
,
and
it
swells
like
a
rolling
snowball
.
 
<EOS>
The
bigger
it
gets
,
the
more
stupid
I
get
.
 
<EOS>
The
case
is
so
hopeless
,
and
I
feel
that
I
am
wallowing
in
such
a
bog
of
nonsense
,
that
I
give
up
all
idea
of
getting
out
,
and
abandon
myself
to
my
fate
.
 
<EOS>
The
despairing
way
in
which
my
mother
and
I
look
at
each
other
,
as
I
blunder
on
,
is
truly
melancholy
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
greatest
effect
in
these
miserable
lessons
is
when
my
mother
(
thinking
nobody
is
observing
her
)
tries
to
give
me
the
cue
by
the
motion
of
her
lips
.
 
<EOS>
At
that
instant
,
Miss
Murdstone
,
who
has
been
lying
in
wait
for
nothing
else
all
along
,
says
in
a
deep
warning
voice
:
   
"
Clara
!
"
   
<EOS>
My
mother
starts
,
colours
,
and
smiles
faintly
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Murdstone
comes
out
of
his
chair
,
takes
the
book
,
throws
it
at
me
or
boxes
my
ears
with
it
,
and
turns
me
out
of
the
room
by
the
shoulders
.
   
<EOS>
Even
when
the
lessons
are
done
,
the
worst
is
yet
to
happen
,
in
the
shape
of
an
appalling
sum
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
invented
for
me
,
and
delivered
to
me
orally
by
Mr
Murdstone
,
and
begins
,
"
If
I
go
into
a
cheesemonger
's
shop
,
and
buy
five
thousand
double
-
Gloucester
cheeses
at
fourpence
-
halfpenny
each
,
present
payment
"
---
at
which
I
see
Miss
Murdstone
secretly
overjoyed
.
 
<EOS>
I
pore
over
these
cheeses
without
any
result
or
enlightenment
until
dinner
-
time
,
when
,
having
made
a
Mulatto
of
myself
by
getting
the
dirt
of
the
slate
into
the
pores
of
my
skin
,
I
have
a
slice
of
bread
to
help
me
out
with
the
cheeses
,
and
am
considered
in
disgrace
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
.
   
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
,
at
this
distance
of
time
,
as
if
my
unfortunate
studies
generally
took
this
course
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
done
very
well
if
I
had
been
without
the
Murdstones
;
but
the
influence
of
the
Murdstones
upon
me
was
like
the
fascination
of
two
snakes
on
a
wretched
young
bird
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
I
did
get
through
the
morning
with
tolerable
credit
,
there
was
not
much
gained
but
dinner
;
for
Miss
Murdstone
never
could
endure
to
see
me
untasked
,
and
if
I
rashly
made
any
show
of
being
unemployed
,
called
her
brother
's
attention
to
me
by
saying
,
"
Clara
,
my
dear
,
there
's
nothing
like
work
---
give
your
boy
an
exercise
"
;
which
caused
me
to
be
clapped
down
to
some
new
labour
,
there
and
then
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
any
recreation
with
other
children
of
my
age
,
I
had
very
little
of
that
;
for
the
gloomy
theology
of
the
Murdstones
made
all
children
out
to
be
a
swarm
of
little
vipers
(
though
there
WAS
a
child
once
set
in
the
midst
of
the
Disciples
)
,
and
held
that
they
contaminated
one
another
.
   
<EOS>
The
natural
result
of
this
treatment
,
continued
,
I
suppose
,
for
some
six
months
or
more
,
was
to
make
me
sullen
,
dull
,
and
dogged
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
made
the
less
so
by
my
sense
of
being
daily
more
and
more
shut
out
and
alienated
from
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
should
have
been
almost
stupefied
but
for
one
circumstance
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
this
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
had
left
a
small
collection
of
books
in
a
little
room
upstairs
,
to
which
I
had
access
(
for
it
adjoined
my
own
)
and
which
nobody
else
in
our
house
ever
troubled
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
blessed
little
room
,
Roderick
Random
,
Peregrine
Pickle
,
Humphrey
Clinker
,
Tom
Jones
,
the
Vicar
of
Wakefield
,
Don
Quixote
,
Gil
Blas
,
and
Robinson
Crusoe
,
came
out
,
a
glorious
host
,
to
keep
me
company
.
<EOS>
They
kept
alive
my
fancy
,
and
my
hope
of
something
beyond
that
place
and
time
,
---
they
,
and
the
Arabian
Nights
,
and
the
Tales
of
the
Genii
,
---
and
did
me
no
harm
;
for
whatever
harm
was
in
some
of
them
was
not
there
for
me
;
I
knew
nothing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
astonishing
to
me
now
,
how
I
found
time
,
in
the
midst
of
my
porings
and
blunderings
over
heavier
themes
,
to
read
those
books
as
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
curious
to
me
how
I
could
ever
have
consoled
myself
under
my
small
troubles
(
which
were
great
troubles
to
me
)
,
by
impersonating
my
favourite
characters
in
them
---
as
I
did
---
and
by
putting
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
into
all
the
bad
ones
---
which
I
did
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
Tom
Jones
(
a
child
's
Tom
Jones
,
a
harmless
creature
)
for
a
week
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
sustained
my
own
idea
of
Roderick
Random
for
a
month
at
a
stretch
,
I
verily
believe
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
greedy
relish
for
a
few
volumes
of
Voyages
and
Travels
<EOS>
---
I
forget
<EOS>
what
,
now
---
that
were
on
those
shelves
;
and
for
days
and
days
I
can
remember
to
have
gone
about
my
region
of
our
house
,
armed
with
the
centre
-
piece
out
of
an
old
set
of
boot
-
trees
---
the
perfect
realization
of
Captain
Somebody
,
of
the
Royal
British
Navy
,
in
danger
of
being
beset
by
savages
,
and
resolved
to
sell
his
life
at
a
great
price
.
 
<EOS>
The
Captain
never
lost
dignity
,
from
having
his
ears
boxed
with
the
Latin
Grammar
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
;
but
the
Captain
was
a
Captain
and
a
hero
,
in
despite
of
all
the
grammars
of
all
the
languages
in
the
world
,
dead
or
alive
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
my
only
and
my
constant
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
think
of
it
,
the
picture
always
rises
in
my
mind
,
of
a
summer
evening
,
the
boys
at
play
in
the
churchyard
,
and
I
sitting
on
my
bed
,
reading
as
if
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
Every
barn
in
the
neighbourhood
,
every
stone
in
the
church
,
and
every
foot
of
the
churchyard
,
had
some
association
of
its
own
,
in
my
mind
,
connected
with
these
books
,
and
stood
for
some
locality
made
famous
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
Tom
Pipes
go
climbing
up
the
church
-
steeple
;
I
have
watched
Strap
,
with
the
knapsack
on
his
back
,
stopping
to
rest
himself
upon
the
wicket
-
gate
;
and
I
know
that
Commodore
Trunnion
held
that
club
with
Mr
Pickle
,
in
the
parlour
of
our
little
village
alehouse
.
   
<EOS>
The
reader
now
understands
,
as
well
as
I
do
,
what
I
was
when
I
came
to
that
point
of
my
youthful
history
to
which
I
am
now
coming
again
.
   
<EOS>
One
morning
when
I
went
into
the
parlour
with
my
books
,
I
found
my
mother
looking
anxious
,
Miss
Murdstone
looking
firm
,
and
Mr
Murdstone
binding
something
round
the
bottom
of
a
cane
---
a
lithe
and
limber
cane
,
which
he
left
off
binding
when
I
came
in
,
and
poised
and
switched
in
the
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
Clara
,
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
,
"
I
have
been
often
flogged
myself
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
To
be
sure
;
of
course
,
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
my
dear
Jane
,
"
faltered
my
mother
,
meekly
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
---
but
do
you
think
it
did
Edward
good
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
it
did
Edward
harm
,
Clara
?
"
asked
Mr
Murdstone
,
gravely
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
point
,
"
said
his
sister
.
   
<EOS>
To
this
my
mother
returned
,
"
Certainly
,
my
dear
Jane
,
"
and
said
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
I
felt
apprehensive
that
I
was
personally
interested
in
this
dialogue
,
and
sought
Mr
Murdstone
's
eye
as
it
lighted
on
mine
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
David
,
"
he
said
---
<EOS>
and
I
saw
that
cast
again
as
he
said
it
<EOS>
---
"
you
must
be
far
more
careful
today
than
usual
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
gave
the
cane
another
poise
,
and
another
switch
;
and
having
finished
his
preparation
of
it
,
laid
it
down
beside
him
,
with
an
impressive
look
,
and
took
up
his
book
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
a
good
freshener
to
my
presence
of
mind
,
as
a
beginning
.
<EOS>
I
felt
the
words
of
my
lessons
slipping
off
,
not
one
by
one
,
or
line
by
line
,
but
by
the
entire
page
;
I
tried
to
lay
hold
of
them
;
but
they
seemed
,
if
I
may
so
express
it
,
to
have
put
skates
on
,
and
to
skim
away
from
me
with
a
smoothness
there
was
no
checking
.
   
<EOS>
We
began
badly
,
and
went
on
worse
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
come
in
with
an
idea
of
distinguishing
myself
rather
,
conceiving
that
I
was
very
well
prepared
;
but
it
turned
out
to
be
quite
a
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
Book
after
book
was
added
to
the
heap
of
failures
,
Miss
Murdstone
being
firmly
watchful
of
us
all
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
we
came
at
last
to
the
five
thousand
cheeses
(
canes
he
made
it
that
day
,
I
remember
)
,
my
mother
burst
out
crying
.
   
<EOS>
"
Clara
!
<EOS>
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
in
her
warning
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
quite
well
,
my
dear
Jane
,
I
think
,
"
said
my
mother
.
   
<EOS>
I
saw
him
wink
,
solemnly
,
at
his
sister
,
as
he
rose
and
said
,
taking
up
the
cane
:
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Jane
,
we
can
hardly
expect
Clara
to
bear
,
with
perfect
firmness
,
the
worry
and
torment
that
David
has
occasioned
her
today
.
 
<EOS>
That
would
be
stoical
.
 
<EOS>
Clara
is
greatly
strengthened
and
improved
,
but
we
can
hardly
expect
so
much
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
David
,
you
and
I
will
go
upstairs
,
boy
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
took
me
out
at
the
door
,
my
mother
ran
towards
us
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
said
,
"
Clara
!
<EOS>
are
you
a
perfect
fool
?
"
and
interfered
.
<EOS>
I
saw
my
mother
stop
her
ears
then
,
and
I
heard
her
crying
.
   
<EOS>
He
walked
me
up
to
my
room
slowly
and
gravely
<EOS>
---
I
am
certain
he
had
a
delight
in
that
formal
parade
of
executing
justice
---
and
when
we
got
there
,
suddenly
twisted
my
head
under
his
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Murdstone
!
 
<EOS>
Sir
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
n't
beat
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
tried
to
learn
,
sir
,
but
I
ca
n't
learn
while
you
and
Miss
Murdstone
are
by
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
you
,
indeed
,
David
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
'll
try
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
my
head
as
in
a
vice
,
but
I
twined
round
him
somehow
,
and
stopped
him
for
a
moment
,
entreating
him
not
to
beat
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
only
a
moment
that
I
stopped
him
,
for
he
cut
me
heavily
an
instant
afterwards
,
and
in
the
same
instant
I
caught
the
hand
with
which
he
held
me
in
my
mouth
,
between
my
teeth
,
and
bit
it
through
.
 
<EOS>
It
sets
my
teeth
on
edge
to
think
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
beat
me
then
,
as
if
he
would
have
beaten
me
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
Above
all
the
noise
we
made
,
I
heard
them
running
up
the
stairs
,
and
crying
out
<EOS>
---
I
heard
my
mother
crying
out
---
and
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
was
gone
;
and
the
door
was
locked
outside
;
and
I
was
lying
,
fevered
and
hot
,
and
torn
,
and
sore
,
and
raging
in
my
puny
way
,
upon
the
floor
.
   
<EOS>
How
well
I
recollect
,
when
I
became
quiet
,
what
an
unnatural
stillness
seemed
to
reign
through
the
whole
house
!
 
<EOS>
How
well
I
remember
,
when
my
smart
and
passion
began
to
cool
,
how
wicked
I
began
to
feel
!
   
<EOS>
I
sat
listening
for
a
long
while
,
but
there
was
not
a
sound
.
 
<EOS>
I
crawled
up
from
the
floor
,
and
saw
my
face
in
the
glass
,
so
swollen
,
red
,
and
ugly
that
it
almost
frightened
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
stripes
were
sore
and
stiff
,
and
made
me
cry
afresh
,
when
I
moved
;
but
they
were
nothing
to
the
guilt
I
felt
.
 
<EOS>
It
lay
heavier
on
my
breast
<EOS>
than
if
I
had
been
a
most
atrocious
criminal
,
I
dare
say
.
   
<EOS>
It
had
begun
to
grow
dark
,
and
I
had
shut
the
window
(
I
had
been
lying
,
for
the
most
part
,
with
my
head
upon
the
sill
,
by
turns
crying
,
dozing
,
and
looking
listlessly
out
)
,
when
the
key
was
turned
,
and
Miss
Murdstone
came
in
with
some
bread
and
meat
,
and
milk
.
 
<EOS>
These
she
put
down
upon
the
table
without
a
word
,
glaring
at
me
the
while
with
exemplary
firmness
,
and
then
retired
,
locking
the
door
after
her
.
   
<EOS>
Long
after
it
was
dark
<EOS>
I
sat
there
,
wondering
whether
anybody
else
would
come
.
 
<EOS>
When
this
appeared
improbable
for
that
night
,
I
undressed
,
and
went
to
bed
;
and
,
there
,
I
began
to
wonder
fearfully
what
would
be
done
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
a
criminal
act
that
I
had
committed
?
 
<EOS>
Whether
I
should
be
taken
into
custody
,
and
sent
to
prison
?
 
<EOS>
Whether
I
was
at
all
in
danger
of
being
hanged
?
   
<EOS>
I
never
shall
forget
the
waking
,
next
morning
;
the
being
cheerful
and
fresh
for
the
first
moment
,
and
then
the
being
weighed
down
by
the
stale
and
dismal
oppression
of
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
reappeared
before
I
was
out
of
bed
;
told
me
,
in
so
many
words
,
that
I
was
free
to
walk
in
the
garden
for
half
an
hour
and
no
longer
;
and
retired
,
leaving
the
door
open
,
that
I
might
avail
myself
of
that
permission
.
   
<EOS>
I
did
so
,
and
did
so
every
morning
of
my
imprisonment
,
which
lasted
five
days
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
could
have
seen
my
mother
alone
,
I
should
have
gone
down
on
my
knees
to
her
and
besought
her
forgiveness
;
but
I
saw
no
one
,
Miss
Murdstone
excepted
,
during
the
whole
time
---
except
at
evening
prayers
in
the
parlour
;
to
which
I
was
escorted
by
Miss
Murdstone
after
everybody
else
was
placed
;
where
I
was
stationed
,
a
young
outlaw
,
all
alone
by
myself
near
the
door
;
and
whence
<EOS>
I
was
solemnly
conducted
by
my
jailer
,
before
any
one
arose
from
the
devotional
posture
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
observed
that
my
mother
was
as
far
off
from
me
as
she
could
be
,
and
kept
her
face
another
way
so
that
I
never
saw
it
;
and
that
Mr
Murdstone
's
hand
was
bound
up
in
a
large
linen
wrapper
.
   
<EOS>
The
length
of
those
five
days
I
can
convey
no
idea
of
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
They
occupy
the
place
of
years
in
my
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
The
way
in
which
I
listened
to
all
the
incidents
of
the
house
that
made
themselves
audible
to
me
;
the
ringing
of
bells
,
the
opening
and
shutting
of
doors
,
the
murmuring
of
voices
,
the
footsteps
on
the
stairs
;
to
any
laughing
,
whistling
,
or
singing
,
outside
,
which
seemed
more
dismal
than
anything
else
to
me
in
my
solitude
and
disgrace
---
the
uncertain
pace
of
the
hours
,
especially
at
night
,
when
I
would
wake
thinking
it
was
morning
,
and
find
that
the
family
were
not
yet
gone
to
bed
,
and
that
all
the
length
of
night
had
yet
to
come
---
the
depressed
dreams
and
nightmares
I
had
---
the
return
of
day
,
noon
,
afternoon
,
evening
,
when
the
boys
played
in
the
churchyard
,
and
I
watched
them
from
a
distance
within
the
room
,
being
ashamed
to
show
myself
at
the
window
lest
they
should
know
I
was
a
prisoner
---
the
strange
sensation
of
never
hearing
myself
speak
---
the
fleeting
intervals
of
something
like
cheerfulness
,
which
came
with
eating
and
drinking
,
and
went
away
with
it
---
the
setting
in
of
rain
one
evening
,
with
a
fresh
smell
,
and
its
coming
down
faster
and
faster
between
me
and
the
church
,
until
it
and
gathering
night
seemed
to
quench
me
in
gloom
,
and
fear
,
and
remorse
---
all
this
appears
to
have
gone
round
and
round
for
years
instead
of
days
<EOS>
,
it
is
so
vividly
and
strongly
stamped
on
my
remembrance
.
<EOS>
On
the
last
night
of
my
restraint
,
I
was
awakened
by
hearing
my
own
name
spoken
in
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
I
started
up
in
bed
,
and
putting
out
my
arms
in
the
dark
,
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Is
that
you
,
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
immediate
answer
,
but
presently
I
heard
my
name
again
,
in
a
tone
so
very
mysterious
and
awful
,
that
I
think
I
should
have
gone
into
a
fit
,
if
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
that
it
must
have
come
through
the
keyhole
.
   
<EOS>
I
groped
my
way
to
the
door
,
and
putting
my
own
lips
to
the
keyhole
,
whispered
:
"
<EOS>
Is
that
you
,
Peggotty
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
own
precious
Davy
,
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
as
soft
as
a
mouse
,
or
the
Cat'll
hear
us
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
understood
this
to
mean
Miss
Murdstone
,
and
was
sensible
of
the
urgency
of
the
case
;
her
room
being
close
by
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
's
mama
,
dear
Peggotty
?
 
<EOS>
Is
she
very
angry
with
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
hear
Peggotty
crying
softly
on
her
side
of
the
keyhole
,
as
I
was
doing
on
mine
,
before
she
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
 
Not
very
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
going
to
be
done
with
me
<EOS>
,
Peggotty
dear
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
School
.
 
<EOS>
Near
London
,
"
was
Peggotty
's
answer
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
get
her
to
repeat
it
,
for
she
spoke
it
the
first
time
quite
down
my
throat
,
in
consequence
of
my
having
forgotten
to
take
my
mouth
away
from
the
keyhole
and
put
my
ear
there
;
and
though
her
words
tickled
me
a
good
deal
,
I
did
n't
hear
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
,
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tomorrow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
the
reason
why
Miss
Murdstone
took
the
clothes
out
of
my
drawers
?
"
<EOS>
which
she
had
done
,
though
I
have
forgotten
to
mention
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
Box
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sha
n't
I
see
mama
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
Morning
.
"
   
<EOS>
Then
Peggotty
fitted
her
mouth
close
to
the
keyhole
,
and
delivered
these
words
through
it
with
as
much
feeling
and
earnestness
as
a
keyhole
has
ever
been
the
medium
of
communicating
,
I
will
venture
to
assert
:
shooting
in
each
broken
little
sentence
in
a
convulsive
little
burst
of
its
own
.
   
<EOS>
"
Davy
,
dear
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
ai
n't
been
azackly
as
intimate
with
you
.
<EOS>
Lately
,
as
I
used
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
because
I
do
n't
love
you
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
well
and
more
,
my
pretty
poppet
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
because
I
thought
it
better
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
for
someone
else
besides
.
 
<EOS>
Davy
,
my
darling
,
are
you
listening
?
 
<EOS>
Can
you
hear
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ye
-
ye
-
ye
-
<EOS>
yes
,
Peggotty
!
<EOS>
"
I
sobbed
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
own
!
<EOS>
"
said
Peggotty
,
with
infinite
compassion
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
I
want
to
say
,
is
.
 
<EOS>
That
you
must
never
forget
me
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
'll
never
forget
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
'll
take
as
much
care
of
your
mama
,
Davy
.
 
<EOS>
As
ever
I
took
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
wo
n't
leave
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
may
come
when
she
'll
be
glad
to
lay
her
poor
head
.
 
<EOS>
On
her
stupid
,
cross
old
Peggotty
's
arm
again
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
'll
write
to
you
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Though
I
ai
n't
no
scholar
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
'll
---
<EOS>
I
'll
---
"
Peggotty
fell
to
kissing
the
keyhole
,
as
she
could
n't
kiss
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
dear
Peggotty
!
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
thank
you
!
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
!
<EOS>
Will
you
promise
me
one
thing
,
Peggotty
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
write
and
tell
Mr
Peggotty
and
little
Em'ly
,
and
Mrs
Gummidge
and
Ham
,
that
I
am
not
so
bad
as
they
might
suppose
,
and
that
I
sent
'em
all
my
love
---
especially
to
little
Em'ly
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
,
if
you
please
,
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
kind
soul
promised
,
and
we
both
of
us
kissed
the
keyhole
with
the
greatest
affection
<EOS>
---
I
patted
it
with
my
hand
,
I
recollect
,
as
if
it
had
been
her
honest
face
---
and
parted
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
night
there
grew
up
in
my
breast
a
feeling
for
Peggotty
which
I
can
not
very
well
define
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
replace
my
mother
;
no
one
could
do
that
;
but
she
came
into
a
vacancy
in
my
heart
,
which
closed
upon
her
,
and
I
felt
towards
her
something
I
have
never
felt
for
any
other
human
being
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
sort
of
comical
affection
,
too
;
and
yet
if
she
had
died
,
I
can
not
think
what
I
should
have
done
,
or
how
I
should
have
acted
out
the
tragedy
it
would
have
been
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
morning
Miss
Murdstone
appeared
as
usual
,
and
told
me
I
was
going
to
school
;
which
was
not
altogether
such
news
to
me
as
she
supposed
.
 
<EOS>
She
also
informed
me
that
when
I
was
dressed
,
I
was
to
come
downstairs
into
the
parlour
,
and
have
my
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
I
found
my
mother
,
very
pale
and
with
red
eyes
:
into
whose
arms
I
ran
,
and
begged
her
pardon
from
my
suffering
soul
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Davy
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
you
could
hurt
anyone
I
love
!
 
<EOS>
Try
to
be
better
,
pray
to
be
better
!
 
<EOS>
I
forgive
you
;
but
I
am
so
grieved
,
Davy
,
that
you
should
have
such
bad
passions
in
your
heart
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
had
persuaded
her
that
I
was
a
wicked
fellow
,
and
she
was
more
sorry
for
that
than
for
my
going
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
it
sorely
.
 
<EOS>
I
tried
to
eat
my
parting
breakfast
,
but
my
tears
dropped
upon
my
bread
-
and
-
butter
,
and
trickled
into
my
tea
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
my
mother
look
at
me
sometimes
,
and
then
glance
at
the
watchful
Miss
Murdstone
,
and
than
look
down
,
or
look
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Master
Copperfield
's
box
there
!
<EOS>
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
when
wheels
were
heard
at
the
gate
.
   
<EOS>
I
looked
for
Peggotty
,
but
it
was
not
she
;
neither
she
nor
Mr
Murdstone
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
My
former
acquaintance
,
the
carrier
,
was
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
the
box
was
taken
out
to
his
cart
,
and
lifted
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
Clara
!
<EOS>
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
in
her
warning
note
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ready
,
my
dear
Jane
,
"
returned
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
Davy
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
going
for
your
own
good
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
my
child
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
come
home
in
the
holidays
,
and
be
a
better
boy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Clara
!
"
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
repeated
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
my
dear
Jane
,
"
replied
my
mother
,
who
was
holding
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
forgive
you
,
my
dear
boy
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Clara
!
"
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
repeated
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
was
good
enough
to
take
me
out
to
the
cart
,
and
to
say
on
the
way
that
she
hoped
I
would
repent
,
before
I
came
to
a
bad
end
;
and
then
I
got
into
the
cart
,
and
the
lazy
horse
walked
off
with
it
.
      
<EOS>
Chapter
5
.
<EOS>
I
am
sent
away
from
home
 
<EOS>
We
might
have
gone
about
half
a
mile
,
and
my
pocket
-
handkerchief
was
quite
wet
through
,
when
the
carrier
stopped
short
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
out
to
ascertain
for
what
,
I
saw
,
to
MY
amazement
,
Peggotty
burst
from
a
hedge
and
climb
into
the
cart
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
me
in
both
her
arms
,
and
squeezed
me
to
her
stays
until
the
pressure
on
my
nose
was
extremely
painful
,
though
I
never
thought
of
that
till
afterwards
when
I
found
it
very
tender
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
single
word
did
Peggotty
speak
.
<EOS>
Releasing
one
of
her
arms
,
she
put
it
down
in
her
pocket
to
the
elbow
,
and
brought
out
some
paper
bags
of
cakes
which
she
crammed
into
my
pockets
,
and
a
purse
which
she
put
into
my
hand
,
but
not
one
word
<EOS>
did
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
After
another
and
a
final
squeeze
with
both
arms
,
she
got
down
from
the
cart
and
ran
away
;
and
,
my
belief
is
,
and
has
always
been
,
without
a
solitary
button
on
her
gown
.
 
<EOS>
I
picked
up
one
,
of
several
that
were
rolling
about
,
and
treasured
it
as
a
keepsake
for
a
long
time
.
   
<EOS>
The
carrier
looked
at
me
,
as
if
to
inquire
if
she
were
coming
back
.
<EOS>
I
shook
my
head
,
and
said
I
thought
not
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
come
up
,
"
said
the
carrier
to
the
lazy
horse
;
who
came
up
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
Having
by
this
time
cried
as
much
as
I
possibly
could
,
I
began
to
think
it
was
of
no
use
crying
any
more
,
especially
as
neither
Roderick
Random
,
nor
that
Captain
in
the
Royal
British
Navy
,
had
ever
cried
,
that
I
could
remember
,
in
trying
situations
.
 
<EOS>
The
carrier
,
seeing
me
in
this
resolution
,
proposed
that
my
pocket
-
handkerchief
should
be
spread
upon
the
horse
's
back
to
dry
.
 
<EOS>
I
thanked
him
,
and
assented
;
and
particularly
small
it
looked
,
under
those
circumstances
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
now
leisure
to
examine
the
purse
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
stiff
leather
purse
,
with
a
snap
,
and
had
three
bright
shillings
in
it
,
which
Peggotty
had
evidently
polished
up
with
whitening
,
for
my
greater
delight
.
 
<EOS>
But
its
most
precious
contents
were
two
half
-
crowns
folded
together
in
a
bit
of
paper
,
on
which
was
written
,
in
my
mother
's
hand
,
"
For
Davy
.
 
<EOS>
With
my
love
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
overcome
by
this
,
that
I
asked
the
carrier
to
be
so
good
as
to
reach
me
<EOS>
my
pocket
-
handkerchief
again
;
but
he
said
he
thought
I
had
better
do
without
it
,
and
I
thought
I
really
had
,
so
I
wiped
my
eyes
on
my
sleeve
and
stopped
myself
.
   
<EOS>
For
good
,
too
;
though
,
in
consequence
of
my
previous
emotions
,
I
was
still
occasionally
seized
with
a
stormy
sob
.
 
<EOS>
After
we
had
jogged
on
for
some
little
time
,
I
asked
the
carrier
if
he
was
going
all
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
the
way
where
?
"
inquired
the
carrier
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
's
there
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
carrier
.
   
<EOS>
"
Near
London
,
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
that
horse
,
"
said
the
carrier
,
jerking
the
rein
to
point
him
out
,
"
would
be
deader
than
pork
afore
<EOS>
he
got
over
half
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
only
going
to
Yarmouth
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
about
it
,
"
said
the
carrier
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
there
I
shall
take
you
to
the
stage
-
cutch
,
and
the
stage
-
cutch
that
'll
take
you
to
---
wherever
it
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
this
was
a
great
deal
for
the
carrier
(
whose
name
was
Mr
Barkis
)
to
say
---
he
being
,
as
I
observed
in
a
former
chapter
,
of
a
phlegmatic
temperament
,
and
not
at
all
conversational
---
I
offered
him
a
cake
as
a
mark
of
attention
,
which
he
ate
at
one
gulp
,
exactly
like
an
elephant
,
and
which
made
no
more
impression
on
his
big
face
than
it
would
have
done
on
an
elephant
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did
SHE
make
'em
,
now
?
"
said
Mr
Barkis
,
always
leaning
forward
,
in
his
slouching
way
,
on
the
footboard
of
the
cart
with
an
arm
on
each
knee
.
   
<EOS>
"
Peggotty
,
do
you
mean
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr
Barkis
.
 
<EOS>
"
Her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
She
makes
all
our
pastry
,
and
does
all
our
cooking
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
she
though
?
"
said
Mr
Barkis
.
<EOS>
He
made
up
his
mouth
as
if
to
whistle
,
but
he
did
n't
whistle
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
looking
at
the
horse
's
ears
,
as
if
he
saw
something
new
there
;
and
sat
so
,
for
a
considerable
time
.
 
<EOS>
By
and
by
<EOS>
,
he
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
No
sweethearts
,
I
b'lieve
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sweetmeats
did
you
say
,
Mr
Barkis
?
"
 
<EOS>
For
I
thought
he
wanted
something
else
to
eat
,
and
had
pointedly
alluded
to
that
description
of
refreshment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hearts
,
"
said
Mr
Barkis
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sweet
hearts
;
no
person
walks
with
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
had
a
sweetheart
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
she
,
though
!
"
said
Mr
Barkis
.
   
<EOS>
Again
he
made
up
his
mouth
to
whistle
,
and
again
he
did
n't
whistle
,
but
sat
looking
at
the
horse
's
ears
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
she
makes
,
"
said
Mr
Barkis
,
after
a
long
interval
of
reflection
,
"
all
the
apple
parsties
,
and
doos
all
the
cooking
,
do
she
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
replied
that
such
was
the
fact
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
"
said
Mr
Barkis
.
 
<EOS>
"
P'raps
you
might
be
writin
'
to
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
certainly
write
to
her
,
"
I
rejoined
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
slowly
turning
his
eyes
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
!
 
<EOS>
If
you
was
writin
'
to
her
,
p'raps
you
'd
recollect
to
say
that
Barkis
was
willin
'
;
would
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
Barkis
is
willing
,
"
I
repeated
,
innocently
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
the
message
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ye
-
es
,
"
he
said
,
considering
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ye
-
es
.
 
<EOS>
Barkis
is
willin
'
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
be
at
Blunderstone
again
tomorrow
,
Mr
Barkis
,
"
I
said
,
faltering
a
little
at
the
idea
of
my
being
far
away
from
it
then
,
"
and
could
give
your
own
message
so
much
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
repudiated
this
suggestion
,
however
,
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
,
and
once
more
confirmed
his
previous
request
by
saying
,
with
profound
gravity
,
"
Barkis
is
willin
'
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
message
,
"
I
readily
undertook
its
transmission
.
 
<EOS>
While
I
was
waiting
for
the
coach
in
the
hotel
at
Yarmouth
that
very
afternoon
,
I
procured
a
sheet
of
paper
and
an
inkstand
,
and
wrote
a
note
to
Peggotty
,
which
ran
thus
:
"
My
dear
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
come
here
safe
.
 
<EOS>
Barkis
is
willing
.
 
<EOS>
My
love
to
mama
.
 
<EOS>
Yours
affectionately
.
 
<EOS>
PS
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
he
particularly
wants
you
to
know
<EOS>
---
BARKIS
IS
WILLING
.
"
   
<EOS>
When
I
had
taken
this
commission
on
myself
prospectively
,
Mr
Barkis
relapsed
into
perfect
silence
;
and
I
,
feeling
quite
worn
out
by
all
that
had
happened
lately
,
lay
down
on
a
sack
in
the
cart
and
fell
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
I
slept
soundly
until
we
got
to
Yarmouth
;
which
was
so
entirely
new
and
strange
to
me
in
the
inn
-
yard
to
which
we
drove
,
that
I
at
once
abandoned
a
latent
hope
I
had
had
of
meeting
with
some
of
Mr
Peggotty
's
family
there
,
perhaps
even
with
little
Em'ly
herself
.
   
<EOS>
The
coach
was
in
the
yard
,
shining
very
much
all
over
,
but
without
any
horses
to
it
as
yet
;
and
it
looked
in
that
state
as
if
nothing
was
more
unlikely
than
its
ever
going
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
thinking
this
,
and
wondering
what
would
ultimately
become
of
my
box
,
which
Mr
Barkis
had
put
down
on
the
yard
-
pavement
by
the
pole
(
he
having
driven
up
the
yard
to
turn
his
cart
)
,
and
also
what
would
ultimately
become
of
me
,
when
a
lady
looked
out
of
a
bow
-
window
where
some
fowls
and
joints
of
meat
were
hanging
up
,
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Is
that
the
little
gentleman
from
Blunderstone
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
,
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
name
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
Copperfield
,
ma'am
,
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
wo
n't
do
,
"
returned
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nobody
's
dinner
is
paid
for
here
,
in
that
name
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
Murdstone
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
're
Master
Murdstone
,
"
said
the
lady
,
"
why
do
you
go
and
give
another
name
,
first
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
explained
to
the
lady
how
it
was
,
who
than
rang
a
bell
,
and
called
out
,
"
William
!
<EOS>
show
the
coffee
-
room
!
"
<EOS>
upon
which
a
waiter
came
running
out
of
a
kitchen
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
yard
to
show
it
,
and
seemed
a
good
deal
surprised
when
he
was
only
to
show
it
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
large
long
room
with
some
large
maps
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
I
could
have
felt
much
stranger
if
the
maps
had
been
real
foreign
countries
,
and
I
cast
away
in
the
middle
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
it
was
taking
a
liberty
to
sit
down
,
with
my
cap
in
my
hand
,
on
the
corner
of
the
chair
nearest
the
door
;
and
when
the
waiter
laid
a
cloth
on
purpose
for
me
,
and
put
a
set
of
castors
on
it
,
I
think
I
must
have
turned
red
all
over
with
modesty
.
   
<EOS>
He
brought
me
some
chops
,
and
vegetables
,
and
took
the
covers
off
in
such
a
bouncing
manner
that
I
was
afraid
I
must
have
given
him
some
offence
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
greatly
relieved
my
mind
by
putting
a
chair
for
me
at
the
table
,
and
saying
,
very
affably
,
"
Now
,
six
-
foot
!
<EOS>
come
on
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
thanked
him
,
and
took
my
seat
at
the
board
;
but
found
it
extremely
difficult
to
handle
my
knife
and
fork
with
anything
like
dexterity
,
or
to
avoid
splashing
myself
with
the
gravy
,
while
he
was
standing
opposite
,
staring
so
hard
,
and
making
me
blush
in
the
most
dreadful
manner
every
time
I
caught
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
After
watching
me
into
the
second
chop
,
he
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
half
a
pint
of
ale
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
have
it
now
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
thanked
him
and
said
,
"
Yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
he
poured
it
out
of
a
jug
into
a
large
tumbler
,
and
held
it
up
against
the
light
,
and
made
it
look
beautiful
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
eye
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
seems
a
good
deal
,
do
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
does
seem
a
good
deal
,
"
I
answered
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
For
it
was
quite
delightful
to
me
,
to
find
him
so
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
twinkling
-
eyed
,
pimple
-
faced
man
,
with
his
hair
standing
upright
all
over
his
head
;
and
as
he
stood
with
one
arm
a
-
kimbo
,
holding
up
the
glass
to
the
light
with
the
other
hand
,
he
looked
quite
friendly
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
gentleman
here
,
yesterday
,
"
he
said
---
"
a
stout
gentleman
,
by
the
name
of
Topsawyer
---
perhaps
you
know
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
<EOS>
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
do
n't
think
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
In
breeches
and
gaiters
,
broad
-
brimmed
hat
,
grey
coat
,
speckled
choker
,
"
said
the
waiter
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
I
said
bashfully
,
"
I
have
n't
the
pleasure
---
"
   
"
He
came
in
here
,
"
said
the
waiter
,
looking
at
the
light
through
the
tumbler
,
"
ordered
a
glass
of
this
ale
---
<EOS>
WOULD
order
it
---
I
told
him
not
---
drank
it
,
and
fell
dead
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
too
old
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
ought
n't
to
be
drawn
;
that
's
the
fact
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
very
much
shocked
to
hear
of
this
melancholy
accident
,
and
said
I
thought
I
had
better
have
some
water
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
you
see
,
"
said
the
waiter
,
still
looking
at
the
light
through
the
tumbler
,
with
one
of
his
eyes
shut
up
,
"
our
people
do
n't
like
things
being
ordered
and
left
.
 
<EOS>
It
offends
'em
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
drink
it
,
if
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
used
to
it
,
and
use
is
everything
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
it
'll
hurt
me
,
if
I
throw
my
head
back
,
and
take
it
off
quick
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
replied
that
he
would
much
oblige
me
by
drinking
it
,
if
he
thought
he
could
do
it
safely
,
but
by
no
means
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
did
throw
his
head
back
,
and
take
it
off
quick
,
I
had
a
horrible
fear
,
I
confess
,
of
seeing
him
meet
the
fate
of
the
lamented
Mr
Topsawyer
,
and
fall
lifeless
on
the
carpet
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
did
n't
hurt
him
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
I
thought
he
seemed
the
fresher
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
have
we
got
here
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
putting
a
fork
into
my
dish
.
"
<EOS>
Not
chops
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Chops
,
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
my
soul
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
"
I
did
n't
know
they
were
chops
.
<EOS>
Why
,
a
chop
's
the
very
thing
to
take
off
the
bad
effects
of
that
beer
!
 
<EOS>
Ai
n't
it
lucky
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
So
he
took
a
chop
by
the
bone
in
one
hand
,
and
a
potato
in
the
other
,
and
ate
away
with
a
very
good
appetite
,
to
my
extreme
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
He
afterwards
took
another
chop
,
and
another
potato
;
and
after
that
,
another
chop
and
another
potato
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
had
done
,
he
brought
me
a
pudding
,
and
having
set
it
before
me
,
seemed
to
ruminate
,
and
to
become
absent
in
his
mind
for
some
moments
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
's
the
pie
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
rousing
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
pudding
,
"
I
made
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pudding
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
bless
me
,
so
it
is
!
 
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
"
looking
at
it
nearer
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
it
's
a
batter
-
pudding
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
is
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
a
batter
-
pudding
,
"
he
said
,
taking
up
a
table
-
spoon
,
"
is
my
favourite
pudding
!
 
<EOS>
Ai
n't
that
lucky
?
 
<EOS>
Come
on
,
little
'
un
,
and
let
's
see
who
'll
get
most
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
waiter
certainly
got
most
.
 
<EOS>
He
entreated
me
more
than
once
to
come
in
and
win
,
but
what
with
his
table
-
spoon
to
my
tea
-
spoon
,
his
dispatch
to
my
dispatch
,
and
his
appetite
to
my
appetite
,
I
was
left
far
behind
at
the
first
mouthful
,
and
had
no
chance
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
anyone
enjoy
a
pudding
so
much
,
I
think
;
and
he
laughed
,
when
it
was
all
gone
,
as
if
his
enjoyment
of
it
lasted
still
.
   
<EOS>
Finding
him
so
very
friendly
and
companionable
,
it
was
then
that
I
asked
for
the
pen
and
ink
and
paper
,
to
write
to
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
He
not
only
brought
it
immediately
,
but
was
good
enough
to
look
over
me
while
I
wrote
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
had
finished
it
,
he
asked
me
where
I
was
going
to
school
.
   
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
Near
London
,
"
which
was
all
I
knew
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
my
eye
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
looking
very
low
-
spirited
,
"
I
am
sorry
for
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Lord
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
that
's
the
school
where
they
broke
the
boy
's
ribs
---
two
ribs
---
a
little
boy
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
say
he
was
---
let
me
see
<EOS>
---
how
old
are
you
,
about
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
told
him
between
eight
and
nine
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
just
his
age
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
eight
years
and
six
months
old
when
they
broke
his
first
rib
;
eight
years
and
eight
months
old
when
they
broke
his
second
,
and
did
for
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
disguise
from
myself
,
or
from
the
waiter
,
that
this
was
an
uncomfortable
coincidence
,
and
inquired
how
it
was
done
.
 
<EOS>
His
answer
was
not
cheering
to
my
spirits
,
for
it
consisted
of
two
dismal
words
,
"
With
whopping
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
blowing
of
the
coach
-
horn
in
the
yard
was
a
seasonable
diversion
,
which
made
me
get
up
and
hesitatingly
inquire
,
in
the
mingled
pride
and
diffidence
of
having
a
purse
(
which
I
took
out
of
my
pocket
)
,
if
there
were
anything
to
pay
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
sheet
of
letter
-
paper
,
"
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
buy
a
sheet
of
letter
-
paper
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
remember
that
I
ever
had
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
dear
,
"
he
said
,
"
on
account
of
the
duty
.
 
<EOS>
Threepence
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
way
we
're
taxed
in
this
country
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
else
,
except
the
waiter
.
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
the
ink
.
 
<EOS>
I
lose
by
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
should
you
---
what
should
I
---
how
much
ought
I
to
---
what
would
it
be
right
to
pay
the
waiter
,
if
you
please
?
<EOS>
"
I
stammered
,
blushing
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
n't
a
family
,
and
that
family
had
n't
the
cowpock
,
"
said
the
waiter
,
"
I
would
n't
take
a
sixpence
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
did
n't
support
a
aged
pairint
,
and
a
lovely
sister
,
"
---
here
the
waiter
was
greatly
agitated
---
"
I
would
n't
take
a
farthing
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
a
good
place
,
and
was
treated
well
here
,
I
should
beg
acceptance
of
a
trifle
,
instead
of
taking
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
live
on
broken
wittles
---
<EOS>
and
I
sleep
on
the
coals
"
---
<EOS>
here
the
waiter
burst
into
tears
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
very
much
concerned
for
his
misfortunes
,
and
felt
that
any
recognition
short
of
ninepence
would
be
mere
brutality
and
hardness
of
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
gave
him
one
of
my
three
bright
shillings
,
which
he
received
with
much
humility
and
veneration
,
and
spun
up
with
his
thumb
,
directly
afterwards
,
to
try
the
goodness
of
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
disconcerting
to
me
,
to
find
,
when
I
was
being
helped
up
behind
the
coach
,
that
I
was
supposed
to
have
eaten
all
the
dinner
without
any
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
I
discovered
this
,
from
overhearing
the
lady
in
the
bow
-
window
<EOS>
say
to
the
guard
,
"
Take
care
of
that
child
,
George
,
or
he
'll
burst
!
"
<EOS>
and
from
observing
that
the
women
-
servants
who
were
about
the
place
came
out
to
look
and
giggle
at
me
as
a
young
phenomenon
.
 
<EOS>
My
unfortunate
friend
the
waiter
,
who
had
quite
recovered
his
spirits
,
did
not
appear
to
be
disturbed
by
this
,
but
joined
in
the
general
admiration
without
being
at
all
confused
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
any
doubt
of
him
,
I
suppose
this
half
awakened
it
;
but
I
am
inclined
to
believe
that
with
the
simple
confidence
of
a
child
,
and
the
natural
reliance
of
a
child
upon
superior
years
(
qualities
I
am
very
sorry
any
children
should
prematurely
change
for
worldly
wisdom
)
,
I
had
no
serious
mistrust
of
him
on
the
whole
,
even
then
.
   
<EOS>
I
felt
it
rather
hard
,
I
must
own
,
to
be
made
,
without
deserving
it
,
the
subject
of
jokes
between
the
coachman
and
guard
as
to
the
coach
drawing
heavy
behind
,
on
account
of
my
sitting
there
,
and
as
to
the
greater
expediency
of
my
travelling
by
waggon
.
 
<EOS>
The
story
of
my
supposed
appetite
getting
wind
among
the
outside
passengers
<EOS>
,
they
were
merry
upon
it
likewise
;
and
asked
me
whether
I
was
going
to
be
paid
for
,
at
school
,
as
two
brothers
or
three
,
and
whether
I
was
contracted
for
,
or
went
upon
the
regular
terms
;
with
other
pleasant
questions
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
worst
of
it
was
,
that
I
knew
I
should
be
ashamed
to
eat
anything
,
when
an
opportunity
offered
,
and
that
,
after
a
rather
light
dinner
,
I
should
remain
hungry
all
night
---
for
I
had
left
my
cakes
behind
,
at
the
hotel
,
in
my
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
My
apprehensions
were
realized
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
stopped
for
supper
I
could
n't
muster
courage
to
take
any
,
though
I
should
have
liked
it
very
much
,
but
sat
by
the
fire
and
said
I
did
n't
want
anything
.
 
<EOS>
This
did
not
save
me
from
more
jokes
,
either
;
for
a
husky
-
voiced
gentleman
with
a
rough
face
,
who
had
been
eating
out
of
a
sandwich
-
box
nearly
all
the
way
,
except
when
he
had
been
drinking
out
of
a
bottle
,
said
I
was
like
a
boa
-
constrictor
who
took
enough
at
one
meal
to
last
him
a
long
time
;
after
which
,
he
actually
brought
a
rash
out
upon
himself
with
boiled
beef
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
started
from
Yarmouth
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
and
we
were
due
in
London
about
eight
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Mid
-
summer
weather
,
and
the
evening
was
very
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
passed
through
a
village
,
I
pictured
to
myself
what
the
insides
of
the
houses
were
like
,
and
what
the
inhabitants
were
about
;
and
when
boys
came
running
after
us
,
and
got
up
behind
and
swung
there
for
a
little
way
,
I
wondered
whether
their
fathers
were
alive
,
and
whether
they
Were
happy
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
plenty
to
think
of
,
therefore
,
besides
my
mind
running
continually
on
the
kind
of
place
I
was
going
to
---
which
was
an
awful
speculation
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
I
remember
,
I
resigned
myself
to
thoughts
of
home
and
Peggotty
;
and
to
endeavouring
,
in
a
confused
blind
way
,
to
recall
how
I
had
felt
,
and
what
sort
of
boy
I
used
to
be
,
<EOS>
before
I
bit
Mr
Murdstone
:
which
I
could
n't
satisfy
myself
about
by
any
means
,
I
seemed
to
have
bitten
him
in
such
a
remote
antiquity
.
   
<EOS>
The
night
was
not
so
pleasant
as
the
evening
,
for
it
got
chilly
;
and
being
put
between
two
gentlemen
(
the
rough
-
faced
one
and
another
)
to
prevent
my
tumbling
off
the
coach
,
I
was
nearly
smothered
by
their
falling
asleep
,
and
completely
blocking
me
up
.
<EOS>
They
squeezed
me
so
hard
sometimes
,
that
I
could
not
help
crying
out
,
"
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
If
you
please
!
"
---
which
they
did
n't
like
at
all
,
because
it
woke
them
.
 
<EOS>
Opposite
<EOS>
me
was
an
elderly
lady
in
a
great
fur
cloak
,
who
looked
in
the
dark
more
like
a
haystack
than
a
lady
<EOS>
,
she
was
wrapped
up
to
such
a
degree
.
 
<EOS>
This
lady
had
a
basket
with
her
,
and
she
had
n't
known
what
to
do
with
it
,
for
a
long
time
,
until
she
found
that
on
account
of
my
legs
being
short
,
it
could
go
underneath
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
cramped
and
hurt
me
so
,
that
it
made
me
perfectly
miserable
;
but
if
I
moved
in
the
least
,
and
made
a
glass
that
was
in
the
basket
rattle
against
something
else
(
as
it
was
sure
to
do
)
,
she
gave
me
the
cruellest
poke
with
her
foot
,
and
said
,
"
Come
,
do
n't
YOU
fidget
.
 
<EOS>
YOUR
bones
are
young
enough
,
I
'm
sure
!
"
   
<EOS>
At
last
the
sun
rose
,
and
then
my
companions
seemed
to
sleep
easier
.
 
<EOS>
The
difficulties
under
which
they
had
laboured
all
night
,
and
which
had
found
utterance
in
the
most
terrific
gasps
and
snorts
,
are
not
to
be
conceived
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
sun
got
higher
,
their
sleep
became
lighter
,
and
so
they
gradually
one
by
one
awoke
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
being
very
much
surprised
by
the
feint
everybody
made
,
then
,
of
not
having
been
to
sleep
at
all
,
and
by
the
uncommon
indignation
with
which
everyone
repelled
the
charge
.
 
<EOS>
I
labour
under
the
same
kind
of
astonishment
to
this
day
,
having
invariably
observed
that
of
all
human
weaknesses
,
<EOS>
the
one
to
which
our
common
nature
is
the
least
disposed
to
confess
<EOS>
(
I
can
not
imagine
why
)
is
the
weakness
of
having
gone
to
sleep
in
a
coach
.
   
<EOS>
What
an
amazing
place
London
was
to
me
when
I
saw
it
in
the
distance
,
and
how
I
believed
all
the
adventures
of
all
my
favourite
heroes
to
be
constantly
enacting
and
re
-
enacting
there
,
and
how
I
vaguely
made
it
out
in
my
own
mind
to
be
fuller
of
wonders
and
wickedness
than
all
the
cities
of
the
earth
,
I
need
not
stop
here
to
relate
.
 
<EOS>
We
approached
it
by
degrees
,
and
got
,
in
due
time
,
to
the
inn
in
the
Whitechapel
district
,
for
which
we
were
bound
.
 
<EOS>
I
forget
whether
it
was
the
Blue
Bull
,
or
the
Blue
Boar
;
but
I
know
it
was
the
Blue
Something
,
and
that
its
likeness
was
painted
up
on
the
back
of
the
coach
.
   
<EOS>
The
guard
's
eye
lighted
on
me
as
he
was
getting
down
,
and
he
said
at
the
booking
-
office
door
:
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anybody
here
for
a
yoongster
booked
in
the
name
of
Murdstone
,
from
Bloonderstone
,
Sooffolk
,
to
be
left
till
called
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
Nobody
answered
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Try
Copperfield
,
if
you
please
,
sir
,
"
said
I
,
looking
helplessly
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anybody
here
for
a
yoongster
,
booked
in
the
name
of
Murdstone
,
from
Bloonderstone
,
Sooffolk
,
but
owning
to
the
name
of
Copperfield
,
to
be
left
till
called
for
?
"
said
the
guard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
!
<EOS>
IS
there
anybody
?
"
   
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nobody
.
 
<EOS>
I
looked
anxiously
around
;
but
the
inquiry
made
no
impression
on
any
of
the
bystanders
,
if
I
except
a
man
in
gaiters
,
with
one
eye
,
who
suggested
that
they
had
better
put
a
brass
collar
round
my
neck
,
and
tie
me
up
in
the
stable
.
   
<EOS>
A
ladder
was
brought
,
and
I
got
down
after
the
lady
,
who
was
like
a
haystack
:
not
daring
to
stir
,
until
her
basket
was
removed
.
 
<EOS>
The
coach
was
clear
of
passengers
by
that
time
,
the
luggage
was
very
soon
cleared
out
,
the
horses
had
been
taken
out
before
the
luggage
,
and
now
the
coach
itself
was
wheeled
and
backed
off
by
some
hostlers
,
out
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
nobody
appeared
,
to
claim
the
dusty
youngster
from
Blunderstone
,
Suffolk
.
   
<EOS>
More
solitary
than
Robinson
Crusoe
,
who
had
nobody
to
look
at
him
and
see
that
he
was
solitary
<EOS>
,
I
went
into
the
booking
-
office
,
and
,
by
invitation
of
the
clerk
on
duty
,
passed
behind
the
counter
,
and
sat
down
on
the
scale
at
which
they
weighed
the
luggage
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
as
I
sat
looking
at
the
parcels
,
packages
,
and
books
,
and
inhaling
the
smell
of
stables
(
ever
since
associated
with
that
morning
)
,
a
procession
of
most
tremendous
considerations
began
to
march
through
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Supposing
nobody
should
ever
fetch
me
,
how
long
would
they
consent
to
keep
me
there
?
 
<EOS>
Would
they
keep
me
long
enough
to
spend
seven
shillings
?
 
<EOS>
Should
I
sleep
at
night
in
one
of
those
wooden
bins
,
with
the
other
luggage
,
and
wash
myself
at
the
pump
in
the
yard
in
the
morning
;
or
should
I
be
turned
out
every
night
,
and
expected
to
come
again
to
be
left
till
called
for
,
when
the
office
opened
next
day
?
 
<EOS>
Supposing
there
was
no
mistake
in
the
case
,
and
Mr
Murdstone
had
devised
this
plan
to
get
rid
of
me
,
what
should
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
If
they
allowed
me
to
remain
there
until
my
seven
shillings
were
spent
,
I
could
n't
hope
to
remain
there
when
I
began
to
starve
.
<EOS>
That
would
obviously
be
inconvenient
and
unpleasant
to
the
customers
,
besides
entailing
on
the
Blue
Whatever
-
it
-
was
,
the
risk
of
funeral
expenses
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
started
off
at
once
,
and
tried
to
walk
back
home
,
how
could
I
ever
find
my
way
,
how
could
I
ever
hope
to
walk
so
far
<EOS>
,
how
could
I
make
sure
of
anyone
but
Peggotty
,
even
if
I
got
back
?
 
<EOS>
If
I
found
out
the
nearest
proper
authorities
,
and
offered
myself
to
go
for
a
soldier
,
or
a
sailor
,
I
was
such
a
little
fellow
that
it
was
most
likely
they
would
n't
take
me
in
.
<EOS>
These
thoughts
,
and
a
hundred
other
such
thoughts
,
turned
me
burning
hot
,
and
made
me
giddy
with
apprehension
and
dismay
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
in
the
height
of
my
fever
when
a
man
entered
and
whispered
to
the
clerk
,
who
presently
slanted
me
off
the
scale
,
and
pushed
me
over
to
him
,
as
if
I
were
weighed
,
bought
,
delivered
,
and
paid
for
.
   
<EOS>
As
I
went
out
of
the
office
,
hand
in
hand
with
this
new
acquaintance
,
I
stole
a
look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
gaunt
,
sallow
young
man
,
with
hollow
cheeks
,
and
a
chin
almost
as
black
as
Mr
Murdstone
's
;
but
there
the
likeness
ended
,
for
his
whiskers
were
shaved
off
,
and
his
hair
,
instead
of
being
glossy
,
was
rusty
and
dry
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
a
suit
of
black
clothes
which
were
rather
rusty
and
dry
too
,
and
rather
short
in
the
sleeves
and
legs
;
and
he
had
a
white
neck
-
kerchief
on
,
that
was
not
over
-
clean
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
,
and
do
not
,
suppose
that
this
neck
-
kerchief
was
all
the
linen
he
wore
,
but
it
was
all
he
showed
or
gave
any
hint
of
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
the
new
boy
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
I
supposed
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
one
of
the
masters
at
Salem
House
,
"
he
said
.
   
<EOS>
I
made
him
a
bow
and
felt
very
much
overawed
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
ashamed
to
allude
to
a
commonplace
thing
like
my
box
,
to
a
scholar
and
a
master
at
Salem
House
,
that
we
had
gone
some
little
distance
from
the
yard
before
I
had
the
hardihood
to
mention
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
turned
back
,
on
my
humbly
insinuating
that
it
might
be
useful
to
me
hereafter
;
and
he
told
the
clerk
that
the
carrier
had
instructions
to
call
for
it
at
noon
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
sir
,
"
I
said
,
when
we
had
accomplished
about
the
same
distance
as
before
,
"
is
it
far
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
down
by
Blackheath
,
"
he
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
far
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
diffidently
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
good
step
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
go
by
the
stage
-
coach
.
<EOS>
It
's
about
six
miles
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
so
faint
and
tired
,
that
the
idea
of
holding
out
for
six
miles
more
,
was
too
much
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
heart
to
tell
him
that
I
had
had
nothing
all
night
,
and
that
if
he
would
allow
me
to
buy
something
to
eat
,
I
should
be
very
much
obliged
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
appeared
surprised
at
this
<EOS>
---
I
see
him
stop
and
look
at
me
now
---
and
after
considering
for
a
few
moments
,
said
he
wanted
to
call
on
an
old
person
who
lived
not
far
off
,
and
that
the
best
way
would
be
for
me
to
buy
some
bread
,
or
whatever
I
liked
best
<EOS>
that
was
wholesome
,
and
make
my
breakfast
at
her
house
,
where
we
could
get
some
milk
.
   
<EOS>
Accordingly
we
looked
in
at
a
baker
's
window
,
and
after
I
had
made
a
series
of
proposals
to
buy
everything
that
was
bilious
in
the
shop
,
and
he
had
rejected
them
one
by
one
<EOS>
,
we
decided
in
favour
of
a
nice
little
loaf
of
brown
bread
,
which
cost
me
threepence
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
at
a
grocer
's
shop
,
we
bought
an
egg
and
a
slice
of
streaky
bacon
;
which
still
left
what
I
thought
a
good
deal
of
change
,
out
of
the
second
of
the
bright
shillings
,
and
made
me
consider
London
a
very
cheap
place
.
 
<EOS>
These
provisions
laid
in
,
we
went
on
through
a
great
noise
and
uproar
that
confused
my
weary
head
beyond
description
,
and
over
a
bridge
which
,
no
doubt
,
was
London
Bridge
(
indeed
I
think
he
told
me
so
,
<EOS>
but
I
was
half
asleep
)
,
until
we
came
to
the
poor
person
's
house
,
which
was
a
part
of
some
alms
-
houses
,
as
I
knew
by
their
look
,
and
by
an
inscription
on
a
stone
over
the
gate
which
said
they
were
established
for
twenty
-
five
poor
women
.
   
<EOS>
The
Master
at
Salem
House
lifted
the
latch
of
one
of
a
number
of
little
black
doors
that
were
all
alike
,
and
had
each
a
little
diamond
-
paned
window
on
one
side
,
and
another
little
diamond
-
paned
window
above
;
and
we
went
into
the
little
house
of
one
of
these
poor
old
women
,
who
was
blowing
a
fire
to
make
a
little
saucepan
boil
.
 
<EOS>
On
seeing
the
master
enter
,
the
old
woman
stopped
with
the
bellows
on
her
knee
,
and
said
something
that
I
thought
sounded
like
"
My
Charley
!
"
<EOS>
but
on
seeing
me
come
in
too
,
she
got
up
,
and
rubbing
her
hands
made
a
confused
sort
of
half
curtsey
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
you
cook
this
young
gentleman
's
breakfast
for
him
,
if
you
please
?
"
said
the
Master
at
Salem
House
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
I
?
"
said
the
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
can
I
,
sure
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
's
Mrs
Fibbitson
today
?
"
said
the
Master
,
looking
at
another
old
woman
in
a
large
chair
by
the
fire
,
who
was
such
a
bundle
of
clothes
that
I
feel
grateful
to
this
hour
for
not
having
sat
upon
her
by
mistake
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
she
's
poorly
,
"
said
the
first
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
one
of
her
bad
days
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
fire
was
to
go
out
,
through
any
accident
,
I
verily
believe
she
'd
go
out
too
,
and
never
come
to
life
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
they
looked
at
her
,
I
looked
at
her
also
.
 
<EOS>
Although
it
was
a
warm
day
,
she
seemed
to
think
of
nothing
but
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancied
she
was
jealous
even
of
the
saucepan
on
it
;
and
I
have
reason
to
know
that
she
took
its
impressment
into
the
service
of
boiling
my
egg
and
broiling
my
bacon
,
in
dudgeon
;
for
I
saw
her
,
with
my
own
discomfited
eyes
,
shake
her
fist
at
me
once
,
when
those
culinary
operations
were
going
on
,
and
no
one
else
was
looking
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
streamed
in
at
the
little
window
,
but
she
sat
with
her
own
back
<EOS>
and
the
back
of
the
large
chair
towards
it
,
screening
the
fire
as
if
she
were
sedulously
keeping
IT
warm
,
instead
of
<EOS>
it
keeping
her
warm
,
and
watching
it
in
a
most
distrustful
manner
.
 
<EOS>
The
completion
of
the
preparations
for
my
breakfast
,
by
relieving
the
fire
,
gave
her
such
extreme
joy
that
she
laughed
aloud
---
and
a
very
unmelodious
laugh
she
had
,
I
must
say
.
   
<EOS>
I
sat
down
to
my
brown
loaf
,
my
egg
,
and
my
rasher
of
bacon
,
with
a
basin
of
milk
besides
,
and
made
a
most
delicious
meal
.
 
<EOS>
While
I
was
yet
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
it
,
the
old
woman
of
the
house
said
to
the
Master
:
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
got
your
flute
with
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
a
blow
at
it
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
coaxingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
Master
,
upon
this
,
put
his
hand
underneath
the
skirts
of
his
coat
,
and
brought
out
his
flute
in
three
pieces
,
which
he
screwed
together
,
and
began
immediately
to
play
.
 
<EOS>
My
impression
is
,
after
many
years
of
consideration
,
that
there
never
can
have
been
anybody
in
the
world
who
played
worse
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
the
most
dismal
sounds
I
have
ever
heard
produced
by
any
means
,
natural
or
artificial
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
the
tunes
were
---
if
there
were
such
things
in
the
performance
at
all
,
which
I
doubt
---
<EOS>
but
the
influence
of
the
strain
upon
me
was
,
first
,
to
make
me
think
of
all
my
sorrows
until
I
could
hardly
keep
my
tears
back
;
then
to
take
away
my
appetite
;
and
lastly
,
to
make
me
so
sleepy
that
I
could
n't
keep
my
eyes
open
.
<EOS>
They
begin
to
close
again
,
and
I
begin
to
nod
,
as
the
recollection
rises
fresh
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
Once
more
the
little
room
,
with
its
open
corner
cupboard
,
and
its
square
-
backed
chairs
,
and
its
angular
little
staircase
leading
to
the
room
above
,
and
<EOS>
its
three
peacock
's
feathers
displayed
over
the
mantelpiece
---
I
remember
wondering
when
I
first
went
in
,
what
that
peacock
would
have
thought
if
he
had
known
what
his
finery
was
doomed
to
come
to
---
<EOS>
fades
from
before
me
,
and
I
nod
,
and
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
The
flute
becomes
inaudible
,
the
wheels
of
the
coach
are
heard
instead
,
and
I
am
on
my
journey
.
 
<EOS>
The
coach
jolts
,
I
wake
with
a
start
,
and
the
flute
has
come
back
again
,
and
the
Master
at
Salem
House
is
sitting
with
his
legs
crossed
,
playing
it
dolefully
,
while
the
old
woman
of
the
house
looks
on
delighted
.
<EOS>
She
fades
in
her
turn
,
and
he
fades
,
and
all
fades
,
and
there
is
no
flute
,
no
Master
,
no
Salem
House
,
no
David
Copperfield
,
no
anything
but
heavy
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
I
dreamed
,
I
thought
,
that
once
while
he
was
blowing
into
this
dismal
flute
,
the
old
woman
of
the
house
,
who
had
gone
nearer
and
nearer
to
him
in
her
ecstatic
admiration
,
leaned
over
the
back
of
his
chair
and
gave
him
an
affectionate
squeeze
round
the
neck
,
which
stopped
his
playing
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
in
the
middle
state
between
sleeping
and
waking
,
either
then
or
immediately
afterwards
;
for
,
as
he
resumed
---
it
was
a
real
fact
that
he
had
stopped
playing
---
I
saw
and
heard
the
same
old
woman
ask
Mrs
Fibbitson
if
it
was
n't
delicious
(
meaning
the
flute
)
,
to
which
Mrs
Fibbitson
replied
,
"
Ay
,
ay
!
yes
!
"
and
nodded
at
the
fire
:
to
which
,
I
am
persuaded
,
she
gave
the
credit
of
the
whole
performance
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
seemed
to
have
been
dozing
a
long
while
,
the
Master
at
Salem
House
unscrewed
his
flute
into
the
three
pieces
,
put
them
up
as
before
,
and
took
me
away
.
 
<EOS>
We
found
the
coach
very
near
at
hand
,
and
got
upon
the
roof
;
but
I
was
so
dead
sleepy
,
that
when
we
stopped
on
the
road
to
take
up
somebody
else
,
they
put
me
inside
where
there
were
no
passengers
,
and
where
I
slept
profoundly
,
until
I
found
the
coach
going
at
a
footpace
up
a
steep
hill
among
green
leaves
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
,
it
stopped
,
and
had
come
to
its
destination
.
   
<EOS>
A
short
walk
brought
us
---
<EOS>
I
mean
the
Master
and
me
---
to
Salem
House
,
which
was
enclosed
with
a
high
brick
wall
,
and
looked
very
dull
.
 
<EOS>
Over
a
door
in
this
wall
was
a
board
with
SALEM
HousE
upon
it
;
and
through
a
grating
in
this
door
we
were
surveyed
when
we
rang
the
bell
by
a
surly
face
,
which
I
found
,
on
the
door
being
opened
,
belonged
to
a
stout
man
with
a
bull
-
neck
,
a
wooden
leg
,
overhanging
temples
,
and
his
hair
cut
close
all
round
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
new
boy
,
"
said
the
Master
.
   
<EOS>
The
man
with
the
wooden
leg
eyed
me
all
over
---
it
did
n't
take
long
,
for
there
was
not
much
of
me
---
and
locked
the
gate
behind
us
,
and
took
out
the
key
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
going
up
to
the
house
,
among
some
dark
heavy
trees
,
when
he
called
after
my
conductor
.
<EOS>
"
Hallo
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
looked
back
,
and
he
was
standing
at
the
door
of
a
little
lodge
,
where
he
lived
,
with
a
pair
of
boots
in
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
!
 
<EOS>
The
cobbler
's
been
,
"
he
said
,
"
since
you
've
been
out
,
Mr
Mell
,
and
he
says
he
ca
n't
mend
'em
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
there
ai
n't
a
bit
of
the
original
boot
left
,
and
he
wonders
you
expect
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
he
threw
the
boots
towards
Mr
Mell
,
who
went
back
a
few
paces
to
pick
them
up
,
and
looked
at
them
(
very
disconsolately
<EOS>
,
I
was
afraid
)
,
as
we
went
on
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
observed
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
the
boots
he
had
on
were
a
good
deal
the
worse
for
wear
,
and
that
his
stocking
was
just
breaking
out
in
one
place
,
like
a
bud
.
   
<EOS>
Salem
House
was
a
square
brick
building
with
wings
;
of
a
bare
and
unfurnished
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
All
about
it
was
so
very
quiet
,
that
I
said
to
Mr
Mell
<EOS>
I
supposed
the
boys
were
out
;
but
he
seemed
surprised
at
my
not
knowing
that
it
was
holiday
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
That
all
the
boys
were
at
their
several
homes
.
 
<EOS>
That
Mr
Creakle
,
the
proprietor
,
was
down
by
the
sea
-
side
with
Mrs
and
Miss
Creakle
;
and
that
I
was
sent
in
holiday
-
time
as
a
punishment
for
my
misdoing
,
all
of
which
he
explained
to
me
as
we
went
along
.
   
<EOS>
I
gazed
upon
the
schoolroom
into
which
he
took
me
,
as
the
most
forlorn
and
desolate
place
I
had
ever
seen
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
A
long
room
with
three
long
rows
of
desks
,
and
six
of
forms
,
and
bristling
all
round
with
pegs
for
hats
and
slates
.
 
<EOS>
Scraps
of
old
copy
-
books
and
exercises
litter
the
dirty
floor
.
 
<EOS>
Some
silkworms
'
houses
,
made
of
the
same
materials
,
are
scattered
over
the
desks
.
 
<EOS>
Two
miserable
little
white
mice
,
left
behind
by
their
owner
,
are
running
up
and
down
in
a
fusty
castle
made
of
pasteboard
and
wire
,
looking
in
all
the
corners
with
their
red
eyes
for
anything
to
eat
.
 
<EOS>
A
bird
,
in
a
cage
very
little
bigger
than
himself
,
makes
a
mournful
rattle
now
and
then
in
hopping
on
his
perch
,
two
inches
high
,
or
dropping
from
it
;
but
neither
sings
nor
chirps
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
strange
unwholesome
smell
upon
the
room
,
like
mildewed
corduroys
,
sweet
apples
wanting
air
,
and
rotten
books
.
 
<EOS>
There
could
not
well
be
more
ink
splashed
about
it
,
if
it
had
been
roofless
from
its
first
construction
,
and
the
skies
had
rained
,
snowed
,
hailed
,
and
blown
ink
through
the
varying
seasons
of
the
year
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Mell
having
left
me
while
he
took
his
irreparable
boots
upstairs
,
I
went
softly
to
the
upper
end
of
the
room
,
observing
all
this
as
I
crept
along
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
I
came
upon
a
pasteboard
placard
,
beautifully
written
,
which
was
lying
on
the
desk
,
and
bore
these
words
:
"
TAKE
CARE
OF
HIM
.
 
<EOS>
HE
BITES
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
got
upon
the
desk
immediately
,
apprehensive
of
at
least
a
great
dog
underneath
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
though
I
looked
all
round
with
anxious
eyes
,
I
could
see
nothing
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
still
engaged
in
peering
about
,
when
Mr
Mell
came
back
,
and
asked
me
what
I
did
up
there
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
says
I
,
"
if
you
please
,
I
'm
looking
for
the
dog
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dog
?
"
<EOS>
he
says
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
dog
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
it
a
dog
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
what
a
dog
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
to
be
taken
care
of
,
sir
;
that
bites
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Copperfield
,
"
says
he
,
gravely
,
"
that
's
not
a
dog
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
My
instructions
are
,
Copperfield
,
to
put
this
placard
on
your
back
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
to
make
such
a
beginning
with
you
,
but
I
must
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
that
he
took
me
down
,
and
tied
the
placard
,
which
was
neatly
constructed
for
the
purpose
,
on
my
shoulders
like
a
knapsack
;
and
wherever
I
went
,
afterwards
,
I
had
the
consolation
of
carrying
it
.
   
<EOS>
What
I
suffered
from
that
placard
,
nobody
can
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
possible
for
people
to
see
me
or
not
,
I
always
fancied
that
somebody
was
reading
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
no
relief
to
turn
round
and
find
nobody
;
for
wherever
my
back
was
,
there
I
imagined
somebody
always
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
That
cruel
man
with
the
wooden
leg
aggravated
my
sufferings
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
authority
;
and
if
he
ever
saw
me
leaning
against
a
tree
,
or
a
wall
,
or
the
house
,
he
roared
out
from
his
lodge
door
in
a
stupendous
voice
,
"
Hallo
,
you
sir
!
 
<EOS>
You
Copperfield
!
 
<EOS>
Show
that
badge
conspicuous
,
or
I
'll
report
you
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
playground
was
a
bare
gravelled
yard
,
open
to
all
the
back
of
the
house
and
the
offices
;
and
I
knew
that
the
servants
read
it
,
and
the
butcher
read
it
,
and
the
baker
read
it
;
that
everybody
,
in
a
word
,
who
came
backwards
and
forwards
to
the
house
,
of
a
morning
when
I
was
ordered
to
walk
there
,
read
that
I
was
to
be
taken
care
of
,
<EOS>
for
I
bit
,
I
recollect
that
I
positively
began
to
have
a
dread
of
myself
,
as
a
kind
of
wild
boy
who
did
bite
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
an
old
door
in
this
playground
,
on
which
the
boys
had
a
custom
of
carving
their
names
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
completely
covered
with
such
inscriptions
.
 
<EOS>
In
my
dread
of
the
end
of
the
vacation
and
their
coming
back
,
I
could
not
read
a
boy
's
name
,
without
inquiring
in
what
tone
and
with
what
emphasis
HE
would
read
,
"
Take
care
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
bites
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
one
boy
---
a
certain
J
Steerforth
---
who
cut
his
name
very
deep
and
very
often
,
who
,
I
conceived
,
would
read
it
in
a
rather
strong
voice
,
and
afterwards
pull
my
hair
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
another
boy
,
one
Tommy
Traddles
,
who
I
dreaded
would
make
game
of
it
,
and
pretend
to
be
dreadfully
frightened
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
third
,
George
Demple
,
who
I
fancied
would
sing
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
looked
,
a
little
shrinking
creature
,
at
that
door
,
until
the
owners
of
all
the
names
---
there
were
five
-
and
-
forty
of
them
in
the
school
then
,
Mr
Mell
said
---
seemed
to
send
me
to
Coventry
by
general
acclamation
,
and
to
cry
out
,
each
in
his
own
way
,
"
Take
care
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
bites
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
same
with
the
places
at
the
desks
and
forms
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
same
with
the
groves
of
deserted
bedsteads
I
peeped
at
,
on
my
way
to
,
and
when
I
was
in
,
my
own
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
dreaming
night
after
night
,
of
being
with
my
mother
as
she
used
to
be
,
or
of
going
to
a
party
at
Mr
Peggotty
's
,
or
of
travelling
outside
the
stage
-
coach
,
or
of
dining
again
with
my
unfortunate
friend
the
waiter
,
and
in
all
these
circumstances
making
people
scream
and
stare
,
by
the
unhappy
disclosure
that
I
had
nothing
on
<EOS>
but
my
little
night
-
shirt
,
and
that
placard
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
monotony
of
my
life
,
and
in
my
constant
apprehension
of
the
re
-
opening
of
the
school
,
it
was
such
an
insupportable
affliction
!
<EOS>
I
had
long
tasks
every
day
to
do
with
Mr
Mell
;
but
I
did
them
,
there
being
no
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
here
,
and
got
through
them
without
disgrace
.
 
<EOS>
Before
,
and
after
them
,
I
walked
about
---
supervised
,
as
I
have
mentioned
,
by
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
.
<EOS>
How
vividly
I
call
to
mind
the
damp
about
the
house
,
the
green
cracked
flagstones
in
the
court
,
an
old
leaky
water
-
butt
,
and
the
discoloured
trunks
of
some
of
the
grim
trees
,
which
seemed
to
have
dripped
more
in
the
rain
than
other
trees
,
and
to
have
blown
less
in
the
sun
!
 
<EOS>
At
one
we
dined
,
Mr
Mell
and
I
,
at
the
upper
end
of
a
long
bare
dining
-
room
,
full
of
deal
tables
,
and
smelling
of
fat
.
<EOS>
Then
,
we
had
more
tasks
until
tea
,
which
Mr
Mell
drank
out
of
a
blue
teacup
,
and
I
out
of
a
tin
pot
.
 
<EOS>
All
day
long
,
and
until
seven
or
eight
in
the
evening
,
Mr
Mell
,
at
his
own
detached
desk
in
the
schoolroom
,
worked
hard
with
pen
,
ink
,
ruler
,
books
,
and
writing
-
paper
,
making
out
the
bills
(
as
I
found
)
for
last
half
-
year
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
put
up
his
things
for
the
night
he
took
out
his
flute
,
and
blew
at
it
,
until
I
almost
thought
he
would
gradually
blow
his
whole
being
into
the
large
hole
at
the
top
,
and
ooze
away
at
the
keys
.
   
<EOS>
I
picture
my
small
self
in
the
dimly
-
lighted
rooms
,
sitting
with
my
head
upon
my
hand
,
listening
to
the
doleful
performance
of
Mr
Mell
,
and
conning
tomorrow
's
lessons
.
 
<EOS>
I
picture
myself
with
my
books
shut
up
,
still
listening
to
the
doleful
performance
of
Mr
Mell
,
and
listening
through
it
to
what
used
to
be
at
home
,
and
to
the
blowing
of
the
wind
on
Yarmouth
flats
,
and
feeling
very
sad
and
solitary
.
 
<EOS>
I
picture
myself
going
up
to
bed
,
among
the
unused
rooms
,
and
sitting
on
my
bed
-
side
crying
for
a
comfortable
word
from
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
I
picture
myself
coming
downstairs
in
the
morning
,
and
looking
through
a
long
ghastly
gash
of
a
staircase
window
at
the
school
-
bell
hanging
on
the
top
of
an
out
-
house
with
a
weathercock
above
it
;
and
dreading
the
time
when
it
shall
ring
J
Steerforth
and
the
rest
to
work
:
which
is
only
second
,
in
my
foreboding
apprehensions
,
to
the
time
when
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
shall
unlock
the
rusty
gate
to
give
admission
to
the
awful
Mr
Creakle
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
I
was
a
very
dangerous
character
in
any
of
these
aspects
,
but
in
all
of
them
I
carried
the
same
warning
on
my
back
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Mell
never
said
much
to
me
,
but
he
was
never
harsh
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
were
company
to
each
other
,
without
talking
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
mention
that
he
would
talk
to
himself
sometimes
,
and
grin
,
and
clench
his
fist
,
and
grind
his
teeth
,
and
pull
his
hair
in
an
unaccountable
manner
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
these
peculiarities
:
<EOS>
and
at
first
they
frightened
me
,
though
I
soon
got
used
to
them
.

Chapter
6
.
<EOS>
I
enlarge
my
circle
of
acquaintance
 
<EOS>
I
HAD
led
this
life
about
a
month
,
when
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
began
to
stump
about
with
a
mop
and
a
bucket
of
water
,
from
which
I
inferred
that
preparations
were
making
to
receive
Mr
Creakle
and
the
boys
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
mistaken
;
for
the
mop
came
into
the
schoolroom
before
long
,
and
turned
out
Mr
Mell
and
me
,
who
lived
where
we
could
,
and
got
on
how
we
could
,
for
some
days
,
during
which
we
were
always
in
the
way
of
two
or
three
young
women
,
who
had
rarely
shown
themselves
before
,
and
were
so
continually
in
the
midst
of
dust
that
I
sneezed
almost
as
much
as
if
Salem
House
had
been
a
great
snuff
-
box
.
   
<EOS>
One
day
I
was
informed
by
Mr
Mell
that
Mr
Creakle
would
be
home
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
evening
,
after
tea
,
I
heard
that
he
was
come
.
<EOS>
Before
bedtime
,
I
was
fetched
by
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
to
appear
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Creakle
's
part
of
the
house
was
a
good
deal
more
comfortable
than
ours
,
and
he
had
a
snug
bit
of
garden
that
looked
pleasant
after
the
dusty
playground
,
which
was
such
a
desert
in
miniature
,
that
I
thought
no
one
but
a
camel
,
or
a
dromedary
,
could
have
felt
at
home
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
me
a
bold
thing
even
to
take
notice
that
the
passage
looked
comfortable
,
as
I
went
on
my
way
,
trembling
,
to
Mr
Creakle
's
presence
:
which
so
abashed
me
,
when
I
was
ushered
into
it
,
that
I
hardly
saw
Mrs
Creakle
or
Miss
Creakle
(
who
were
both
there
,
in
the
parlour
)
,
or
anything
but
Mr
Creakle
,
a
stout
gentleman
with
a
bunch
of
watch
-
chain
and
seals
,
in
an
arm
-
chair
,
with
a
tumbler
and
bottle
beside
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
!
"
said
Mr
Creakle
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
young
gentleman
whose
teeth
are
to
be
filed
!
 
<EOS>
Turn
him
round
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
wooden
-
legged
man
turned
me
about
so
as
to
exhibit
the
placard
;
and
having
afforded
time
for
a
full
survey
of
it
,
turned
me
about
again
,
with
my
face
to
Mr
Creakle
,
and
posted
himself
at
Mr
Creakle
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Creakle
's
face
was
fiery
,
and
his
eyes
were
small
,
and
deep
in
his
head
;
he
had
thick
veins
in
his
forehead
,
a
little
nose
,
and
a
large
chin
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
bald
on
the
top
of
his
head
;
and
had
some
thin
wet
-
looking
hair
that
was
just
turning
grey
,
brushed
across
each
temple
,
so
that
the
two
sides
interlaced
on
his
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
circumstance
about
him
which
impressed
me
most
,
was
,
that
he
had
no
voice
,
but
spoke
in
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
The
exertion
this
cost
him
,
or
the
consciousness
of
talking
in
that
feeble
way
,
made
his
angry
face
so
much
more
angry
,
and
his
thick
veins
so
much
thicker
,
when
he
spoke
,
that
I
am
not
surprised
,
on
looking
back
,
at
this
peculiarity
striking
me
as
his
chief
one
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
"
said
Mr
Creakle
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
report
of
this
boy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
against
him
yet
,
"
returned
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
has
been
no
opportunity
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
thought
Mr
Creakle
was
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
Mrs
and
Miss
Creakle
(
at
whom
I
now
glanced
for
the
first
time
,
and
who
were
,
both
,
thin
and
quiet
)
were
not
disappointed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
here
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
said
Mr
Creakle
,
beckoning
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
here
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
,
repeating
the
gesture
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
happiness
of
knowing
your
father
-
in
-
law
,
"
whispered
Mr
Creakle
,
taking
me
by
the
ear
;
"
and
a
worthy
man
he
is
,
and
a
man
of
a
strong
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
knows
me
,
and
I
know
him
.
 
<EOS>
Do
YOU
know
me
?
 
<EOS>
Hey
?
"
said
Mr
Creakle
,
pinching
my
ear
with
ferocious
playfulness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
,
sir
,
"
I
said
,
flinching
with
the
pain
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
?
 
<EOS>
Hey
?
"
repeated
Mr
Creakle
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
soon
.
 
<EOS>
Hey
?
"
   
"
You
will
soon
.
 
<EOS>
Hey
?
"
repeated
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
.
 
<EOS>
I
afterwards
found
that
he
generally
acted
,
with
his
strong
voice
,
as
Mr
Creakle
's
interpreter
to
the
boys
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
very
much
frightened
,
and
said
,
I
hoped
so
,
if
he
pleased
.
<EOS>
I
felt
,
all
this
while
,
as
if
my
ear
were
blazing
;
he
pinched
it
so
hard
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
am
,
"
whispered
Mr
Creakle
,
letting
it
go
at
last
,
with
a
screw
at
parting
that
brought
the
water
into
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
Tartar
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
Tartar
,
"
said
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
say
I
'll
do
a
thing
,
I
do
it
,
"
said
Mr
Creakle
;
"
<EOS>
and
when
I
say
I
will
have
a
thing
done
,
I
will
have
it
done
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
---
Will
have
a
thing
done
,
I
will
have
it
done
,
"
repeated
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
determined
character
,
"
said
Mr
Creakle
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
my
duty
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
My
flesh
and
blood
"
---
he
looked
at
Mrs
Creakle
as
he
said
this
---
"
when
it
rises
against
me
,
is
not
my
flesh
and
blood
.
 
<EOS>
I
discard
it
.
 
<EOS>
Has
that
fellow
"
---
to
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
---
"
been
here
again
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
was
the
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr
Creakle
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
knows
better
.
 
<EOS>
He
knows
me
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
keep
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
let
him
keep
away
,
"
said
Mr
Creakle
,
striking
his
hand
upon
the
table
,
and
looking
at
Mrs
Creakle
,
"
for
he
knows
me
.
 
<EOS>
Now
you
have
begun
to
know
me
too
,
my
young
friend
,
and
you
may
go
.
 
<EOS>
Take
him
away
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
very
glad
to
be
ordered
away
,
for
Mrs
and
Miss
Creakle
<EOS>
were
both
wiping
their
eyes
,
and
I
felt
as
uncomfortable
for
them
as
I
did
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
had
a
petition
on
my
mind
which
concerned
me
so
nearly
,
that
I
could
n't
help
saying
,
though
I
wondered
at
my
own
courage
:
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
sir
---
"
   
Mr
Creakle
whispered
,
"
Hah
!
 
<EOS>
What
's
this
?
"
and
bent
his
eyes
upon
me
,
as
if
he
would
have
burnt
me
up
with
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
sir
,
"
I
faltered
,
"
if
I
might
be
allowed
(
I
am
very
sorry
indeed
,
sir
,
for
what
I
did
)
to
take
this
writing
off
,
before
the
boys
come
back
---
"
   
Whether
Mr
Creakle
was
in
earnest
,
or
whether
he
only
did
it
to
frighten
me
,
I
do
n't
know
,
but
he
made
a
burst
out
of
his
chair
,
before
which
I
precipitately
retreated
,
without
waiting
for
the
escort
Of
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
,
and
never
once
stopped
until
I
reached
my
own
bedroom
,
where
,
finding
I
was
not
pursued
,
I
went
to
bed
,
as
it
was
time
,
and
lay
quaking
,
for
a
couple
of
hours
.
   
<EOS>
Next
morning
Mr
Sharp
came
back
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sharp
was
the
first
master
,
and
superior
to
Mr
Mell
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mell
took
his
meals
with
the
boys
,
but
Mr
Sharp
dined
and
supped
at
Mr
Creakle
's
table
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
limp
,
delicate
-
looking
gentleman
,
I
thought
,
with
a
good
deal
of
nose
,
and
a
way
of
carrying
his
head
on
one
side
,
as
if
it
were
a
little
too
heavy
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
hair
was
very
smooth
and
wavy
;
but
I
was
informed
by
the
very
first
boy
who
came
back
that
it
was
a
wig
(
a
second
-
hand
one
HE
said
)
,
and
that
Mr
Sharp
went
out
every
Saturday
afternoon
to
get
it
curled
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
no
other
than
Tommy
Traddles
who
gave
me
this
piece
of
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
first
boy
who
returned
.
 
<EOS>
He
introduced
himself
by
informing
me
that
I
should
find
his
name
on
the
right
-
hand
corner
of
the
gate
,
over
the
top
-
bolt
;
upon
that
I
said
,
"
Traddles
?
"
<EOS>
to
which
he
replied
,
"
The
same
,
"
and
then
he
asked
me
for
a
full
account
of
myself
and
family
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
happy
circumstance
for
me
that
Traddles
came
back
first
.
<EOS>
He
enjoyed
my
placard
so
much
,
that
he
saved
me
from
the
embarrassment
of
either
disclosure
or
concealment
,
by
presenting
me
to
every
other
boy
who
came
back
,
great
or
small
,
immediately
on
his
arrival
,
in
this
form
of
introduction
,
"
Look
here
!
 
<EOS>
Here
's
a
game
!
"
 
<EOS>
Happily
,
too
,
the
greater
part
of
the
boys
came
back
low
-
spirited
,
and
were
not
so
boisterous
at
my
expense
as
I
had
expected
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
them
certainly
did
dance
about
me
like
wild
Indians
,
and
the
greater
part
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
pretending
that
I
was
a
dog
,
and
patting
and
soothing
me
,
lest
I
should
bite
,
and
saying
,
"
Lie
down
,
sir
!
"
and
calling
me
Towzer
.
<EOS>
This
was
naturally
confusing
,
among
so
many
strangers
,
and
cost
me
some
tears
,
but
on
the
whole
it
was
much
better
than
I
had
anticipated
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
not
considered
as
being
formally
received
into
the
school
,
however
,
until
J
Steerforth
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
Before
this
boy
,
who
was
reputed
to
be
a
great
scholar
,
and
was
very
good
-
looking
,
and
at
least
half
-
a
-
dozen
years
my
senior
,
I
was
carried
as
before
a
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
He
inquired
,
under
a
shed
in
the
playground
,
into
the
particulars
of
my
punishment
,
and
was
pleased
to
express
his
opinion
that
it
was
"
a
jolly
shame
"
;
for
which
I
became
bound
to
him
ever
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
money
have
you
got
,
Copperfield
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
walking
aside
with
me
when
he
had
disposed
of
my
affair
in
these
terms
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
seven
shillings
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
give
it
to
me
to
take
care
of
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
you
can
if
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
n't
if
you
do
n't
like
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
hastened
to
comply
with
his
friendly
suggestion
,
and
opening
Peggotty
's
purse
,
turned
it
upside
down
into
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
want
to
spend
anything
now
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
thank
you
,
"
I
replied
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
,
if
you
like
,
you
know
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Say
the
word
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
I
repeated
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
'd
like
to
spend
a
couple
of
shillings
or
so
,
in
a
bottle
of
currant
wine
by
and
by
,
up
in
the
bedroom
?
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
belong
to
my
bedroom
,
I
find
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
certainly
had
not
occurred
to
me
before
,
but
I
said
,
Yes
,
I
should
like
that
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
glad
to
spend
another
shilling
or
so
,
in
almond
cakes
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
said
,
Yes
,
I
should
like
that
,
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
another
shilling
or
so
in
biscuits
,
and
another
in
fruit
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
young
Copperfield
,
you
're
going
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
smiled
because
he
smiled
,
but
I
was
a
little
troubled
in
my
mind
,
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
make
it
stretch
as
far
as
we
can
;
that
's
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
do
the
best
in
my
power
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
go
out
when
I
like
,
and
I
'll
smuggle
the
prog
in
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
these
words
he
put
the
money
in
his
pocket
,
and
kindly
told
me
not
to
make
myself
uneasy
;
he
would
take
care
<EOS>
it
should
be
all
right
.
<EOS>
He
was
as
good
as
his
word
,
if
that
were
all
right
which
I
had
a
secret
misgiving
was
nearly
all
wrong
---
for
I
feared
it
was
a
waste
of
my
mother
's
two
half
-
crowns
---
though
I
had
preserved
the
piece
of
paper
they
were
wrapped
in
:
which
was
a
precious
saving
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
went
upstairs
to
bed
,
he
produced
the
whole
seven
shillings'worth
,
and
laid
it
out
on
my
bed
in
the
moonlight
,
saying
:
   
"
There
you
are
,
young
Copperfield
,
and
a
royal
spread
you
've
got
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
n't
think
of
doing
the
honours
of
the
feast
,
at
my
time
of
life
,
while
he
was
by
;
my
hand
shook
at
the
very
thought
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
begged
him
to
do
me
the
favour
of
presiding
;
and
my
request
being
seconded
by
the
other
boys
who
were
in
that
room
,
he
acceded
to
it
,
and
sat
upon
my
pillow
,
handing
round
the
viands
---
with
perfect
fairness
,
I
must
say
---
and
dispensing
the
currant
wine
in
a
little
glass
without
a
foot
,
which
was
his
own
property
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
me
,
I
sat
on
his
left
hand
,
and
the
rest
were
grouped
about
us
,
on
the
nearest
beds
and
on
the
floor
.
   
<EOS>
How
well
I
recollect
our
sitting
there
,
talking
in
whispers
;
or
their
talking
,
and
my
respectfully
listening
<EOS>
,
I
ought
rather
to
say
;
the
moonlight
falling
a
little
way
into
the
room
,
through
the
window
,
painting
a
pale
window
on
the
floor
,
and
the
greater
part
of
us
in
shadow
,
except
when
Steerforth
dipped
a
match
into
a
phosphorus
-
box
,
when
he
wanted
to
look
for
anything
on
the
board
,
and
shed
a
blue
glare
over
us
that
was
gone
directly
!
 
<EOS>
A
certain
mysterious
feeling
,
consequent
on
the
darkness
,
the
secrecy
of
the
revel
,
and
the
whisper
in
which
everything
was
said
,
steals
over
me
again
,
and
I
listen
to
all
they
tell
me
with
a
vague
feeling
of
solemnity
and
awe
,
which
makes
me
glad
that
they
are
all
so
near
,
and
frightens
me
(
though
I
feign
to
laugh
)
<EOS>
when
Traddles
pretends
to
see
a
ghost
in
the
corner
.
   
<EOS>
I
heard
all
kinds
of
things
about
the
school
and
all
belonging
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
that
Mr
Creakle
had
not
preferred
his
claim
to
being
a
Tartar
without
reason
;
that
he
was
the
sternest
and
most
severe
of
masters
;
that
he
laid
about
him
,
right
and
left
,
every
day
of
his
life
,
charging
in
among
the
boys
like
a
trooper
,
and
slashing
away
,
unmercifully
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
knew
nothing
himself
,
but
the
art
of
slashing
,
being
more
ignorant
(
J
Steerforth
said
)
than
the
lowest
boy
in
the
school
;
that
he
had
been
,
a
good
many
years
ago
,
a
small
hop
-
dealer
in
the
Borough
,
and
had
taken
to
the
schooling
business
after
being
bankrupt
in
hops
,
and
making
away
with
Mrs
Creakle
's
money
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
good
deal
more
of
that
sort
,
which
I
wondered
how
they
knew
.
   
<EOS>
I
heard
that
the
man
with
the
wooden
leg
,
whose
name
was
Tungay
,
was
an
obstinate
barbarian
who
had
formerly
assisted
in
the
hop
business
,
but
had
come
into
the
scholastic
line
with
Mr
Creakle
,
in
consequence
,
as
was
supposed
among
the
boys
,
of
his
having
broken
his
leg
in
Mr
Creakle
's
service
,
and
having
done
a
deal
of
dishonest
work
for
him
,
and
knowing
his
secrets
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
that
with
the
single
exception
of
Mr
Creakle
,
Tungay
considered
the
whole
establishment
,
masters
and
boys
,
as
his
natural
enemies
,
and
that
the
only
delight
of
his
life
was
to
be
sour
and
malicious
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
that
Mr
Creakle
had
a
son
,
who
had
not
been
Tungay
's
friend
,
and
who
,
assisting
in
the
school
,
had
once
held
some
remonstrance
with
his
father
on
an
occasion
when
its
discipline
was
very
cruelly
exercised
,
and
was
supposed
,
besides
,
to
have
protested
against
his
father
's
usage
of
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
that
Mr
Creakle
had
turned
him
out
of
doors
,
in
consequence
;
and
that
Mrs
and
Miss
Creakle
had
been
in
a
sad
way
,
ever
since
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
greatest
wonder
that
I
heard
of
Mr
Creakle
was
,
there
being
one
boy
in
the
school
on
whom
he
never
ventured
to
lay
a
hand
,
and
that
boy
being
J
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
Steerforth
himself
confirmed
this
when
it
was
stated
,
and
said
that
he
should
like
to
begin
to
see
him
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
On
being
asked
by
a
mild
boy
(
not
me
)
how
he
would
proceed
if
he
did
begin
to
see
him
do
it
,
he
dipped
a
match
into
his
phosphorus
-
box
on
purpose
to
shed
a
glare
over
his
reply
,
and
said
he
would
commence
by
knocking
him
down
with
a
blow
on
the
forehead
from
the
seven
-
and
-
sixpenny
ink
-
bottle
that
was
always
on
the
mantelpiece
.
 
<EOS>
We
sat
in
the
dark
for
some
time
,
breathless
.
   
<EOS>
I
heard
that
Mr
Sharp
and
Mr
Mell
were
both
supposed
to
be
wretchedly
paid
;
and
that
when
there
was
hot
and
cold
meat
for
dinner
at
Mr
Creakle
's
table
,
Mr
Sharp
was
always
expected
to
say
he
preferred
cold
;
which
was
again
corroborated
by
J
Steerforth
,
the
only
parlour
-
boarder
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
that
Mr
Sharp
's
wig
did
n't
fit
him
;
and
that
he
need
n't
be
so
"
bounceable
"
---
somebody
else
said
"
bumptious
"
---
about
it
,
because
his
own
red
hair
was
very
plainly
to
be
seen
behind
.
   
<EOS>
I
heard
that
one
boy
,
who
was
a
coal
-
merchant
's
son
,
came
as
a
set
-
off
against
the
coal
-
bill
,
and
was
called
,
on
that
account
,
"
Exchange
or
Barter
"
---
a
name
selected
from
the
arithmetic
book
as
expressing
this
arrangement
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
that
the
table
beer
was
a
robbery
of
parents
,
and
the
pudding
an
imposition
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
that
Miss
Creakle
was
regarded
by
the
school
in
general
as
being
in
love
with
Steerforth
;
and
I
am
sure
,
as
I
sat
in
the
dark
,
thinking
of
his
nice
voice
,
and
his
fine
face
,
and
his
easy
manner
,
and
his
curling
hair
,
I
thought
it
very
likely
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
that
Mr
Mell
was
not
a
bad
sort
of
fellow
,
but
had
n't
a
sixpence
to
bless
himself
with
;
and
that
there
was
no
doubt
that
old
Mrs
Mell
,
his
mother
,
was
as
poor
as
job
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
of
my
breakfast
then
,
and
what
had
sounded
like
"
My
Charley
!
"
<EOS>
but
I
was
,
I
am
glad
to
remember
,
as
mute
as
a
mouse
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
The
hearing
of
all
this
,
and
a
good
deal
more
,
outlasted
the
banquet
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
greater
part
of
the
guests
had
gone
to
bed
as
soon
as
the
eating
and
drinking
were
over
;
and
we
,
who
had
remained
whispering
and
listening
half
-
undressed
,
at
last
betook
ourselves
to
bed
,
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
young
Copperfield
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
care
of
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
very
kind
,
"
I
gratefully
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
got
a
sister
,
have
you
?
"
said
Steerforth
,
yawning
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
I
answered
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
pity
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
had
one
,
I
should
think
she
would
have
been
a
pretty
,
timid
,
little
,
bright
-
eyed
sort
of
girl
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
liked
to
know
her
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
,
young
Copperfield
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
sir
,
"
I
replied
.
   
<EOS>
I
thought
of
him
very
much
after
I
went
to
bed
,
and
raised
myself
,
I
recollect
,
to
look
at
him
where
he
lay
in
the
moonlight
,
with
his
handsome
face
turned
up
,
and
his
head
reclining
easily
on
his
arm
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
person
of
great
power
in
my
eyes
;
that
was
,
of
course
,
the
reason
of
my
mind
running
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
No
veiled
future
dimly
glanced
upon
him
in
the
moonbeams
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
shadowy
picture
of
his
footsteps
,
in
the
garden
that
I
dreamed
of
walking
in
all
night
.

Chapter
7
.
<EOS>
My
"
First
Half
"
at
Salem
House
 
School
began
in
earnest
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
A
profound
impression
was
made
upon
me
,
I
remember
,
by
the
roar
of
voices
in
the
schoolroom
suddenly
becoming
hushed
as
death
when
Mr
Creakle
entered
after
breakfast
,
and
stood
in
the
doorway
looking
round
upon
us
like
a
giant
in
a
story
-
book
surveying
his
captives
.
   
<EOS>
Tungay
stood
at
Mr
Creakle
's
elbow
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
occasion
,
I
thought
,
to
cry
out
"
Silence
!
"
<EOS>
so
ferociously
,
for
the
boys
were
all
struck
speechless
and
motionless
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Creakle
was
seen
to
speak
,
and
Tungay
was
heard
,
to
this
effect
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
boys
,
this
is
a
new
half
.
 
<EOS>
Take
care
what
you
're
about
,
in
this
new
half
.
 
<EOS>
Come
fresh
up
to
the
lessons
,
I
advise
you
,
for
I
come
fresh
up
to
the
punishment
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
flinch
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
of
no
use
your
rubbing
yourselves
;
you
wo
n't
rub
the
marks
out
that
I
shall
give
you
.
 
<EOS>
Now
get
to
work
,
every
boy
!
"
   
<EOS>
When
this
dreadful
exordium
was
over
,
and
Tungay
had
stumped
out
again
,
Mr
Creakle
came
to
where
I
sat
,
and
told
me
that
if
I
were
famous
for
biting
,
he
was
famous
for
biting
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
showed
me
the
cane
,
and
asked
me
what
I
thought
of
THAT
,
for
a
tooth
?
 
<EOS>
Was
it
a
sharp
tooth
,
<EOS>
hey
?
 
<EOS>
Was
it
a
double
tooth
,
<EOS>
hey
?
 
<EOS>
Had
it
a
deep
prong
,
<EOS>
hey
?
 
<EOS>
Did
it
bite
,
hey
?
 
<EOS>
Did
it
bite
?
 
<EOS>
At
every
question
he
gave
me
a
fleshy
cut
with
it
that
made
me
writhe
;
so
I
was
very
soon
made
free
of
Salem
House
(
as
Steerforth
said
)
,
and
was
very
soon
in
tears
also
.
   
<EOS>
Not
that
I
mean
to
say
these
were
special
marks
of
distinction
,
which
only
I
received
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
a
large
majority
of
the
boys
(
especially
the
smaller
ones
)
were
visited
with
similar
instances
of
notice
,
as
Mr
Creakle
made
the
round
of
the
schoolroom
.
 
<EOS>
Half
the
establishment
was
writhing
and
crying
,
before
the
day
's
work
began
;
and
how
much
of
it
had
writhed
and
cried
before
the
day
's
work
was
over
,
I
am
really
afraid
to
recollect
,
lest
I
should
seem
to
exaggerate
.
   
<EOS>
I
should
think
there
never
can
have
been
a
man
who
enjoyed
his
profession
more
than
Mr
Creakle
did
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
delight
in
cutting
at
the
boys
,
which
was
like
the
satisfaction
of
a
craving
appetite
.
<EOS>
I
am
confident
that
he
could
n't
resist
a
chubby
boy
,
especially
;
that
there
was
a
fascination
in
such
a
subject
,
which
made
him
restless
in
his
mind
,
until
he
had
scored
and
marked
him
for
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
chubby
myself
,
and
ought
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
<EOS>
when
I
think
of
the
fellow
now
,
my
blood
rises
against
him
with
the
disinterested
indignation
I
should
feel
if
I
could
have
known
all
about
him
without
having
ever
been
in
his
power
;
but
it
rises
hotly
,
because
I
know
him
to
have
been
an
incapable
brute
,
who
had
no
more
right
to
be
possessed
of
the
great
trust
he
held
,
than
to
be
Lord
High
Admiral
,
or
Commander
-
in
-
Chief
---
in
either
of
which
capacities
it
is
probable
that
he
would
have
done
infinitely
less
mischief
.
   
<EOS>
Miserable
little
propitiators
of
a
remorseless
Idol
<EOS>
,
how
abject
we
were
to
him
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
launch
in
life
<EOS>
I
think
it
now
,
on
looking
back
,
to
be
so
mean
and
servile
to
a
man
of
such
parts
and
pretensions
!
   
<EOS>
Here
I
sit
at
the
desk
again
,
watching
his
eye
---
humbly
watching
his
eye
,
as
he
rules
a
ciphering
-
book
for
another
victim
whose
hands
have
just
been
flattened
by
that
identical
ruler
,
and
who
is
trying
to
wipe
the
sting
out
with
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
plenty
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
watch
his
eye
in
idleness
,
but
because
I
am
morbidly
attracted
to
it
,
in
a
dread
desire
to
know
what
he
will
do
next
,
and
whether
it
will
be
my
turn
to
suffer
,
or
somebody
else
's
.
<EOS>
A
lane
of
small
boys
beyond
me
,
with
the
same
interest
in
his
eye
,
watch
it
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
knows
it
,
though
he
pretends
he
do
n't
.
<EOS>
He
makes
dreadful
mouths
as
he
rules
the
ciphering
-
book
;
and
now
he
throws
his
eye
sideways
down
our
lane
,
and
we
all
droop
over
our
books
and
tremble
.
 
<EOS>
A
moment
afterwards
we
are
again
eyeing
him
.
<EOS>
An
unhappy
culprit
,
found
guilty
of
imperfect
exercise
,
approaches
at
his
command
.
 
<EOS>
The
culprit
falters
excuses
,
and
professes
a
determination
to
do
better
tomorrow
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Creakle
cuts
a
joke
before
he
beats
him
,
and
we
laugh
at
it
,
---
<EOS>
miserable
little
dogs
,
we
laugh
,
with
our
visages
as
white
as
ashes
,
and
our
hearts
sinking
into
our
boots
.
   
<EOS>
Here
I
sit
at
the
desk
again
,
on
a
drowsy
summer
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
A
buzz
and
hum
go
up
around
me
,
as
if
the
boys
were
so
many
bluebottles
.
<EOS>
A
cloggy
sensation
of
the
lukewarm
fat
of
meat
is
upon
me
(
we
dined
an
hour
or
two
ago
)
,
and
my
head
is
as
heavy
as
so
much
lead
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
give
the
world
to
go
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
with
my
eye
on
Mr
Creakle
,
blinking
at
him
like
a
young
owl
<EOS>
;
when
sleep
overpowers
me
for
a
minute
,
he
still
looms
through
my
slumber
,
ruling
those
ciphering
-
books
,
until
he
softly
comes
behind
me
and
wakes
me
to
plainer
perception
of
him
,
with
a
red
ridge
across
my
back
.
   
<EOS>
Here
I
am
in
the
playground
,
with
my
eye
still
fascinated
by
him
,
though
I
ca
n't
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
window
at
a
little
distance
from
which
I
know
he
is
having
his
dinner
,
stands
for
him
,
and
I
eye
that
instead
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
shows
his
face
near
it
,
mine
assumes
an
imploring
and
submissive
expression
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
looks
out
through
the
glass
,
the
boldest
boy
(
Steerforth
excepted
)
stops
in
the
middle
of
a
shout
or
yell
,
and
becomes
contemplative
.
 
<EOS>
One
day
,
Traddles
(
the
most
unfortunate
boy
in
the
world
)
breaks
that
window
accidentally
,
with
a
ball
.
 
<EOS>
I
shudder
at
this
moment
with
the
tremendous
sensation
of
seeing
it
done
,
and
feeling
that
the
ball
has
bounded
on
to
Mr
Creakle
's
sacred
head
.
   
<EOS>
Poor
Traddles
!
 
<EOS>
In
a
tight
sky
-
blue
suit
that
made
his
arms
and
legs
like
German
sausages
,
or
roly
-
poly
puddings
,
he
was
the
merriest
and
most
miserable
of
all
the
boys
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
always
being
caned
<EOS>
---
I
think
he
was
caned
every
day
that
half
-
year
,
except
one
holiday
Monday
when
he
was
only
ruler'd
on
both
hands
---
and
was
always
going
to
write
to
his
uncle
about
it
,
and
never
did
.
 
<EOS>
After
laying
his
head
on
the
desk
for
a
little
while
,
he
would
cheer
up
,
somehow
,
begin
to
laugh
again
,
and
draw
skeletons
all
over
his
slate
,
before
his
eyes
were
dry
.
 
<EOS>
I
used
at
first
to
wonder
what
comfort
Traddles
found
in
drawing
skeletons
;
and
for
some
time
looked
upon
him
as
a
sort
of
hermit
,
who
reminded
himself
by
those
symbols
of
mortality
that
caning
could
n't
last
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
believe
he
only
did
it
because
they
were
easy
,
and
did
n't
want
any
features
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
very
honourable
,
Traddles
was
,
and
held
it
as
a
solemn
duty
in
the
boys
to
stand
by
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
He
suffered
for
this
on
several
occasions
;
and
particularly
once
,
when
Steerforth
laughed
in
church
,
and
the
Beadle
thought
it
was
Traddles
,
and
took
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
now
,
going
away
in
custody
,
despised
by
the
congregation
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
said
who
was
the
real
offender
,
though
he
smarted
for
it
next
day
,
and
was
imprisoned
so
many
hours
that
he
came
forth
with
a
whole
churchyard
-
full
of
skeletons
swarming
all
over
his
Latin
Dictionary
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
his
reward
.
 
<EOS>
Steerforth
said
there
was
nothing
of
the
sneak
in
Traddles
,
and
we
all
felt
that
to
be
the
highest
praise
.
 
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
could
have
gone
through
a
good
deal
(
though
I
was
much
less
brave
than
Traddles
,
and
nothing
like
so
old
)
to
have
won
such
a
recompense
.
   
<EOS>
To
see
Steerforth
walk
to
church
before
us
,
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
Miss
Creakle
,
was
one
of
the
great
sights
of
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
think
Miss
Creakle
equal
to
little
Em'ly
in
point
of
beauty
,
and
I
did
n't
love
her
<EOS>
(
I
did
n't
dare
)
;
but
I
thought
her
a
young
lady
of
extraordinary
attractions
,
and
in
point
of
gentility
not
to
be
surpassed
.
 
<EOS>
When
Steerforth
,
in
white
trousers
,
carried
her
parasol
for
her
,
I
felt
proud
to
know
him
;
and
believed
that
she
could
not
choose
but
adore
him
with
all
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sharp
and
Mr
Mell
were
both
notable
personages
in
my
eyes
;
but
Steerforth
was
to
them
what
the
sun
was
to
two
stars
.
   
<EOS>
Steerforth
continued
his
protection
of
me
,
and
proved
a
very
useful
friend
;
since
nobody
dared
to
annoy
one
whom
he
honoured
with
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
n't
---
or
at
all
events
he
did
n't
---
defend
me
from
Mr
Creakle
,
who
was
very
severe
with
me
;
but
whenever
I
had
been
treated
worse
than
usual
,
he
always
told
me
that
I
wanted
a
little
of
his
pluck
,
and
that
he
would
n't
have
stood
it
himself
;
which
I
felt
he
intended
for
encouragement
,
and
considered
to
be
very
kind
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
one
advantage
,
and
only
one
that
I
know
of
,
in
Mr
Creakle
's
severity
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
my
placard
in
his
way
when
he
came
up
or
down
behind
the
form
on
which
I
sat
,
and
wanted
to
make
a
cut
at
me
in
passing
;
for
this
reason
it
was
soon
taken
off
,
and
I
saw
it
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
An
accidental
circumstance
cemented
the
intimacy
between
Steerforth
and
me
,
in
a
manner
that
inspired
me
with
great
pride
and
satisfaction
,
though
it
sometimes
led
to
inconvenience
.
 
<EOS>
It
happened
on
one
occasion
,
when
he
was
doing
me
the
honour
of
talking
to
me
in
the
playground
,
that
I
hazarded
the
observation
that
something
or
somebody
---
I
forget
what
now
---
was
like
something
or
somebody
in
Peregrine
Pickle
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
at
the
time
;
but
when
I
was
going
to
bed
at
night
,
asked
me
if
I
had
got
that
book
?
   
<EOS>
I
told
him
no
,
and
explained
how
it
was
that
I
had
read
it
,
and
all
those
other
books
of
which
I
have
made
mention
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
do
you
recollect
them
?
"
<EOS>
Steerforth
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
"
I
replied
;
I
had
a
good
memory
,
and
I
believed
I
recollected
them
very
well
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
tell
you
what
,
young
Copperfield
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
"
you
shall
tell
'em
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
get
to
sleep
very
early
at
night
,
and
I
generally
wake
rather
early
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
go
over
'em
one
after
another
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
make
some
regular
Arabian
Nights
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
felt
extremely
flattered
by
this
arrangement
,
and
we
commenced
carrying
it
into
execution
that
very
evening
.
 
<EOS>
What
ravages
I
committed
on
my
favourite
authors
in
the
course
of
my
interpretation
of
them
,
I
am
not
in
a
condition
to
say
,
and
should
be
very
unwilling
to
know
;
but
I
had
a
profound
faith
in
them
,
and
I
had
,
to
the
best
of
my
belief
,
a
simple
,
earnest
manner
of
narrating
what
I
did
narrate
;
and
these
qualities
went
a
long
way
.
   
<EOS>
The
drawback
was
,
that
I
was
often
sleepy
at
night
,
or
out
of
spirits
and
indisposed
to
resume
the
story
;
and
then
it
was
rather
hard
work
,
and
it
must
be
done
;
for
to
disappoint
or
to
displease
Steerforth
was
of
course
out
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
morning
,
too
,
when
I
felt
weary
,
and
should
have
enjoyed
another
hour
's
repose
very
much
,
it
was
a
tiresome
thing
to
be
roused
,
like
the
Sultana
Scheherazade
,
and
forced
into
a
long
story
before
the
getting
-
up
bell
rang
;
but
Steerforth
was
resolute
;
and
as
he
explained
to
me
,
in
return
,
my
sums
and
exercises
,
and
anything
in
my
tasks
that
was
too
hard
for
me
,
I
was
no
loser
by
the
transaction
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
do
myself
justice
,
however
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
moved
by
no
interested
or
selfish
motive
,
nor
was
I
moved
by
fear
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
admired
and
loved
him
,
and
his
approval
was
return
enough
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
so
precious
to
me
that
I
look
back
on
these
trifles
,
now
,
with
an
aching
heart
.
   
<EOS>
Steerforth
was
considerate
,
too
;
and
showed
his
consideration
,
in
one
particular
instance
,
in
an
unflinching
manner
that
was
a
little
tantalizing
,
I
suspect
,
to
poor
Traddles
and
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
's
promised
letter
---
what
a
comfortable
letter
it
was
!
<EOS>
---
arrived
before
"
the
half
"
was
many
weeks
old
;
and
with
it
a
cake
in
a
perfect
nest
of
oranges
,
and
two
bottles
of
cowslip
wine
.
 
<EOS>
This
treasure
,
as
in
duty
bound
,
I
laid
at
the
feet
of
Steerforth
,
and
begged
him
to
dispense
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
young
Copperfield
,
"
said
he
:
"
the
wine
shall
be
kept
to
wet
your
whistle
when
you
are
story
-
telling
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
blushed
at
the
idea
,
and
begged
him
,
in
my
modesty
,
not
to
think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
said
he
had
observed
I
was
sometimes
hoarse
---
a
little
roopy
was
his
exact
expression
---
and
it
should
be
,
every
drop
,
devoted
to
the
purpose
he
had
mentioned
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
it
was
locked
up
in
his
box
,
and
drawn
off
by
himself
in
a
phial
,
and
administered
to
me
through
a
piece
of
quill
in
the
cork
,
when
I
was
supposed
to
be
in
want
of
a
restorative
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
to
make
it
a
more
sovereign
specific
,
he
was
so
kind
as
to
squeeze
orange
juice
into
it
,
or
to
stir
it
up
with
ginger
,
or
dissolve
a
peppermint
drop
in
it
;
and
although
I
can
not
assert
that
the
flavour
was
improved
by
these
experiments
,
or
that
it
was
exactly
the
compound
one
would
have
chosen
for
a
stomachic
,
the
last
thing
at
night
and
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
,
I
drank
it
gratefully
and
was
very
sensible
of
his
attention
.
   
<EOS>
We
seem
,
to
me
,
to
have
been
months
over
Peregrine
,
and
months
more
over
the
other
stories
.
 
<EOS>
The
institution
never
flagged
for
want
of
a
story
,
I
am
certain
;
and
the
wine
lasted
out
almost
as
well
as
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Traddles
---
I
never
think
of
that
boy
but
with
a
strange
disposition
to
laugh
,
and
with
tears
in
my
eyes
---
was
a
sort
of
chorus
,
in
general
;
and
affected
to
be
convulsed
with
mirth
at
the
comic
parts
,
and
to
be
overcome
with
fear
when
there
was
any
passage
of
an
alarming
character
in
the
narrative
.
 
<EOS>
This
rather
put
me
out
,
very
often
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
jest
of
his
,
I
recollect
,
to
pretend
that
he
could
n't
keep
his
teeth
from
chattering
,
whenever
mention
was
made
of
an
Alguazill
in
connexion
with
the
adventures
of
Gil
Blas
;
and
I
remember
that
when
Gil
Blas
met
the
captain
of
the
robbers
in
Madrid
,
this
unlucky
joker
counterfeited
such
an
ague
of
terror
,
that
he
was
overheard
by
Mr
Creakle
,
who
was
prowling
about
the
passage
,
and
handsomely
flogged
for
disorderly
conduct
in
the
bedroom
.
<EOS>
Whatever
I
had
within
me
that
was
romantic
and
dreamy
,
was
encouraged
by
so
much
story
-
telling
in
the
dark
;
and
in
that
respect
the
pursuit
may
not
have
been
very
profitable
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
being
cherished
as
a
kind
of
plaything
in
my
room
,
and
the
consciousness
that
this
accomplishment
of
mine
was
bruited
about
among
the
boys
,
and
attracted
a
good
deal
of
notice
to
me
though
I
was
the
youngest
there
,
stimulated
me
to
exertion
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
school
carried
on
by
sheer
cruelty
,
whether
it
is
presided
over
by
a
dunce
or
not
,
there
is
not
likely
to
be
much
learnt
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
our
boys
were
,
generally
,
as
ignorant
a
set
as
any
schoolboys
in
existence
;
they
were
too
much
troubled
and
knocked
about
to
learn
;
they
could
no
more
do
that
to
advantage
,
than
any
one
can
do
anything
to
advantage
in
a
life
of
constant
misfortune
,
torment
,
and
worry
.
<EOS>
But
my
little
vanity
,
and
Steerforth
's
help
,
urged
me
on
somehow
;
and
without
saving
me
from
much
,
if
anything
,
in
the
way
of
punishment
,
made
me
,
for
the
time
I
was
there
,
an
exception
to
the
general
body
,
insomuch
that
I
did
steadily
pick
up
some
crumbs
of
knowledge
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
I
was
much
assisted
by
Mr
Mell
,
who
had
a
liking
for
me
that
I
am
grateful
to
remember
.
 
<EOS>
It
always
gave
me
pain
to
observe
that
Steerforth
treated
him
with
systematic
disparagement
,
and
seldom
lost
an
occasion
of
wounding
his
feelings
,
or
inducing
others
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
This
troubled
me
the
more
for
a
long
time
,
because
I
had
soon
told
Steerforth
,
from
whom
I
could
no
more
keep
such
a
secret
,
than
I
could
keep
a
cake
or
any
other
tangible
possession
,
about
the
two
old
women
Mr
Mell
<EOS>
had
taken
me
to
see
;
and
I
was
always
afraid
that
Steerforth
would
let
it
out
,
and
twit
him
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
We
little
thought
<EOS>
,
any
one
of
us
,
I
dare
say
,
when
I
ate
my
breakfast
that
first
morning
,
and
went
to
sleep
under
the
shadow
of
the
peacock
's
feathers
to
the
sound
of
the
flute
,
what
consequences
would
come
of
the
introduction
into
those
alms
-
houses
of
my
insignificant
person
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
visit
had
its
unforeseen
consequences
;
and
of
a
serious
sort
,
too
,
in
their
way
.
   
<EOS>
One
day
when
Mr
Creakle
kept
the
house
from
indisposition
,
which
naturally
diffused
a
lively
joy
through
the
school
,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
noise
in
the
course
of
the
morning
's
work
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
relief
and
satisfaction
experienced
by
the
boys
made
them
difficult
to
manage
;
and
though
the
dreaded
Tungay
brought
his
wooden
leg
in
twice
or
thrice
,
and
took
notes
of
the
principal
offenders
'
names
,
no
great
impression
was
made
by
it
,
as
they
were
pretty
sure
of
getting
into
trouble
tomorrow
,
do
what
they
would
,
and
thought
it
wise
,
no
doubt
,
to
enjoy
themselves
today
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
,
properly
,
a
half
-
holiday
;
being
Saturday
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
the
noise
in
the
playground
would
have
disturbed
Mr
Creakle
,
and
the
weather
was
not
favourable
for
going
out
walking
,
we
were
ordered
into
school
in
the
afternoon
,
and
set
some
lighter
tasks
than
usual
,
which
were
made
for
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
day
of
the
week
on
which
Mr
Sharp
went
out
to
get
his
wig
curled
;
so
Mr
Mell
,
who
always
did
the
drudgery
,
whatever
it
was
,
kept
school
by
himself
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
associate
the
idea
of
a
bull
or
a
bear
with
anyone
so
mild
as
Mr
Mell
,
I
should
think
of
him
,
in
connexion
with
that
afternoon
when
the
uproar
was
at
its
height
,
as
of
one
of
those
animals
,
baited
by
a
thousand
dogs
.
 
<EOS>
I
recall
him
bending
his
aching
head
,
supported
on
his
bony
hand
,
over
the
book
on
his
desk
,
and
wretchedly
endeavouring
to
get
on
with
his
tiresome
work
,
amidst
an
uproar
that
might
have
made
the
Speaker
of
the
House
of
Commons
giddy
.
 
<EOS>
Boys
started
in
and
out
of
their
places
,
playing
at
puss
in
the
corner
with
other
boys
;
there
were
laughing
boys
,
singing
boys
,
talking
boys
,
dancing
boys
,
howling
boys
;
boys
shuffled
with
their
feet
,
boys
whirled
about
him
,
grinning
,
making
faces
,
mimicking
him
behind
his
back
and
before
his
eyes
;
mimicking
his
poverty
,
his
boots
,
his
coat
,
his
mother
,
everything
belonging
to
him
that
they
should
have
had
consideration
for
.
   
<EOS>
"
Silence
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Mell
,
suddenly
rising
up
,
and
striking
his
desk
with
the
book
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
does
this
mean
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
impossible
to
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
maddening
.
 
<EOS>
How
can
you
do
it
to
me
,
boys
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
my
book
that
he
struck
his
desk
with
;
and
as
I
stood
beside
him
,
following
his
eye
as
it
glanced
round
the
room
,
I
saw
the
boys
all
stop
,
some
suddenly
surprised
,
some
half
afraid
,
and
some
sorry
perhaps
.
   
<EOS>
Steerforth
's
place
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
school
,
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
long
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
lounging
with
his
back
against
the
wall
,
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
looked
at
Mr
Mell
with
his
mouth
shut
up
as
if
he
were
whistling
,
when
Mr
Mell
looked
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Silence
,
Mr
Steerforth
!
"
said
Mr
Mell
.
   
<EOS>
"
Silence
yourself
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
turning
red
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whom
are
you
talking
to
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
"
said
Mr
Mell
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
yourself
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
"
and
mind
your
business
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
titter
,
and
some
applause
;
but
Mr
Mell
was
so
white
,
that
silence
immediately
succeeded
;
and
one
boy
,
who
had
darted
out
behind
him
to
imitate
his
mother
again
,
changed
his
mind
,
and
pretended
to
want
a
pen
mended
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
think
,
Steerforth
,
"
said
Mr
Mell
,
"
that
I
am
not
acquainted
with
the
power
you
can
establish
over
any
mind
here
"
<EOS>
---
he
laid
his
hand
,
without
considering
what
he
did
(
as
I
supposed
)
,
upon
my
head
---
"
or
that
I
have
not
observed
you
,
within
a
few
minutes
,
urging
your
juniors
on
to
every
sort
of
outrage
against
me
,
you
are
mistaken
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
give
myself
the
trouble
of
thinking
at
all
about
you
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
coolly
;
"
so
I
'm
not
mistaken
,
as
it
happens
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
you
make
use
of
your
position
of
favouritism
here
,
sir
,
"
pursued
Mr
Mell
,
with
his
lip
trembling
very
much
,
"
to
insult
a
gentleman
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
---
where
is
he
?
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
Here
somebody
cried
out
,
"
Shame
,
J
Steerforth
!
 
<EOS>
Too
bad
!
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
Traddles
;
whom
Mr
Mell
instantly
discomfited
by
bidding
him
hold
his
tongue
.
   
<EOS>
---
"
To
insult
one
who
is
not
fortunate
in
life
,
sir
,
and
who
never
gave
you
the
least
offence
,
and
the
many
reasons
for
not
insulting
whom
you
are
old
enough
and
wise
enough
to
understand
,
"
said
Mr
Mell
,
with
his
lips
trembling
more
and
more
,
"
you
commit
a
mean
and
base
action
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
sit
down
or
stand
up
as
you
please
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Copperfield
,
go
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Young
Copperfield
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
coming
forward
up
the
room
,
"
stop
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
,
<EOS>
Mr
Mell
,
once
for
all
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
take
the
liberty
of
calling
me
mean
or
base
,
or
anything
of
that
sort
,
you
are
an
impudent
beggar
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
always
a
beggar
,
you
know
;
but
when
you
do
that
,
you
are
an
impudent
beggar
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
am
not
clear
whether
he
was
going
to
strike
Mr
Mell
,
or
Mr
Mell
was
going
to
strike
him
,
or
there
was
any
such
intention
on
either
side
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
a
rigidity
come
upon
the
whole
school
as
if
they
had
been
turned
into
stone
,
and
found
Mr
Creakle
in
the
midst
of
us
,
with
Tungay
at
his
side
,
and
Mrs
and
Miss
Creakle
looking
in
at
the
door
as
if
they
were
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mell
,
with
his
elbows
on
his
desk
and
his
face
in
his
hands
,
sat
,
for
some
moments
,
quite
still
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Mell
,
"
said
Mr
Creakle
,
shaking
him
by
the
arm
;
and
his
whisper
was
so
audible
now
,
that
Tungay
felt
it
unnecessary
to
repeat
his
words
<EOS>
;
"
you
have
not
forgotten
yourself
,
I
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
no
,
"
returned
the
Master
,
showing
his
face
,
and
shaking
his
head
,
and
rubbing
his
hands
in
great
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
have
remembered
myself
,
<EOS>
I
---
<EOS>
no
,
Mr
Creakle
,
I
have
not

myself
,
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
have
remembered
myself
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
---
I
---
could
wish
you
had
remembered
me
a
little
sooner
,
Mr
Creakle
.
 
<EOS>
It
---
it
---
would
have
been
more
kind
,
sir
,
more
just
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
saved
me
something
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Creakle
,
looking
hard
at
Mr
Mell
,
put
his
hand
on
Tungay
's
shoulder
,
and
got
his
feet
upon
the
form
close
by
,
and
sat
upon
the
desk
.
 
<EOS>
After
still
looking
hard
at
Mr
Mell
from
his
throne
,
as
he
shook
his
head
,
and
rubbed
his
hands
,
and
remained
in
the
same
state
of
agitation
,
Mr
Creakle
turned
to
Steerforth
,
and
said
:
   
"
Now
,
sir
,
as
he
do
n't
condescend
to
tell
me
,
what
is
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
Steerforth
evaded
the
question
for
a
little
while
;
looking
in
scorn
and
anger
on
his
opponent
,
and
remaining
silent
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
thinking
even
in
that
interval
<EOS>
,
I
remember
,
what
a
noble
fellow
he
was
in
appearance
,
and
<EOS>
how
homely
and
plain
Mr
Mell
looked
opposed
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
mean
by
talking
about
favourites
,
then
?
"
said
Steerforth
at
length
.
   
<EOS>
"
Favourites
?
"
<EOS>
repeated
Mr
Creakle
,
with
the
veins
in
his
forehead
swelling
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
talked
about
favourites
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
did
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
pray
,
what
did
you
mean
by
that
,
sir
?
"
demanded
Mr
Creakle
,
turning
angrily
on
his
assistant
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
meant
,
Mr
Creakle
,
"
he
returned
in
a
low
voice
,
"
as
I
said
;
that
no
pupil
had
a
right
to
avail
himself
of
his
position
of
favouritism
to
degrade
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
degrade
YOU
?
"
said
Mr
Creakle
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
stars
!
 
<EOS>
But
give
me
leave
to
ask
you
,
Mr
What's
-
your
-
name
"
;
and
here
Mr
Creakle
folded
his
arms
,
cane
and
all
,
upon
his
chest
,
and
made
such
a
knot
of
his
brows
that
his
little
eyes
were
hardly
visible
below
them
;
"
whether
,
when
you
talk
about
favourites
,
you
showed
proper
respect
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
To
me
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Creakle
,
darting
his
head
at
him
suddenly
,
and
drawing
it
back
again
,
"
the
principal
of
this
establishment
,
and
your
employer
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
judicious
,
sir
,
I
am
willing
to
admit
,
"
said
Mr
Mell
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
done
so
,
if
I
had
been
cool
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Steerforth
struck
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
he
said
I
was
mean
,
and
then
he
said
I
was
base
,
and
then
I
called
him
a
beggar
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
cool
,
perhaps
I
should
n't
have
called
him
a
beggar
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
did
,
and
I
am
ready
to
take
the
consequences
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Without
considering
,
perhaps
,
whether
there
were
any
consequences
to
be
taken
,
I
felt
quite
in
a
glow
at
this
gallant
speech
.
 
<EOS>
It
made
an
impression
on
the
boys
too
,
for
there
was
a
low
stir
among
them
,
though
no
one
spoke
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
surprised
,
Steerforth
---
although
your
candour
does
you
honour
,
"
said
Mr
Creakle
,
"
does
you
honour
,
certainly
---
<EOS>
I
am
surprised
,
Steerforth
,
I
must
say
,
that
you
should
attach
such
an
epithet
to
any
person
employed
and
paid
in
Salem
House
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Steerforth
gave
a
short
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
an
answer
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Creakle
,
"
to
my
remark
.
 
<EOS>
I
expect
more
than
that
from
you
,
Steerforth
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
If
Mr
Mell
looked
homely
,
in
my
eyes
,
before
the
handsome
boy
,
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
say
how
homely
Mr
Creakle
looked
.
<EOS>
"
Let
him
deny
it
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Deny
that
he
is
a
beggar
,
Steerforth
?
"
cried
Mr
Creakle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
where
does
he
go
a
-
begging
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
he
is
not
a
beggar
himself
,
his
near
relation
's
one
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
the
same
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
glanced
at
me
,
and
Mr
Mell
's
hand
gently
patted
me
upon
the
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
I
looked
up
with
a
flush
upon
my
face
and
remorse
in
my
heart
,
but
Mr
Mell
's
eyes
were
fixed
on
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
He
continued
to
pat
me
kindly
on
the
shoulder
,
but
he
looked
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Since
you
expect
me
,
Mr
Creakle
,
to
justify
myself
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
"
and
to
say
what
I
mean
,
---
what
I
have
to
say
is
,
that
his
mother
lives
on
charity
in
an
alms
-
house
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Mell
still
looked
at
him
,
and
still
patted
me
kindly
on
the
shoulder
,
and
said
to
himself
,
in
a
whisper
,
if
I
heard
right
:
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
thought
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Creakle
turned
to
his
assistant
,
with
a
severe
frown
and
laboured
politeness
:
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
you
hear
what
this
gentleman
says
,
Mr
Mell
.
 
<EOS>
Have
the
goodness
,
if
you
please
,
to
set
him
right
before
the
assembled
school
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
right
,
sir
,
without
correction
,
"
returned
Mr
Mell
,
in
the
midst
of
a
dead
silence
;
"
what
he
has
said
is
true
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Be
so
good
then
as
declare
publicly
,
will
you
,
"
said
Mr
Creakle
,
putting
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
rolling
his
eyes
round
the
school
,
"
whether
it
ever
came
to
my
knowledge
until
this
moment
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
not
directly
,
"
he
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
you
know
not
,
"
said
Mr
Creakle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
,
man
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
apprehend
you
never
supposed
my
worldly
circumstances
to
be
very
good
,
"
replied
the
assistant
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
my
position
is
,
and
always
has
been
,
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
apprehend
,
if
you
come
to
that
,
"
said
Mr
Creakle
,
with
his
veins
swelling
again
bigger
than
ever
,
"
that
you
've
been
in
a
wrong
position
altogether
,
and
mistook
this
for
a
charity
school
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mell
,
we
'll
part
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
The
sooner
the
better
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
time
,
"
answered
Mr
Mell
,
rising
,
"
like
the
present
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
to
you
!
"
said
Mr
Creakle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
take
my
leave
of
you
,
Mr
Creakle
,
and
all
of
you
,
"
said
Mr
Mell
,
glancing
round
the
room
,
and
again
patting
me
gently
on
the
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
"
James
Steerforth
,
the
best
wish
I
can
leave
you
is
that
you
may
come
to
be
ashamed
of
what
you
have
done
today
.
 
<EOS>
At
present
I
would
prefer
to
see
you
anything
rather
than
a
friend
,
to
me
,
or
to
anyone
in
whom
I
feel
an
interest
.
"
   
<EOS>
Once
more
he
laid
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
;
and
then
taking
his
flute
and
a
few
books
from
his
desk
,
and
leaving
the
key
in
it
for
his
successor
,
he
went
out
of
the
school
,
with
his
property
under
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Creakle
then
made
a
speech
,
through
Tungay
,
in
which
he
thanked
Steerforth
for
asserting
(
though
perhaps
too
warmly
)
the
independence
and
respectability
of
Salem
House
;
and
which
he
wound
up
by
shaking
hands
with
Steerforth
,
while
we
gave
three
cheers
---
I
did
not
quite
know
what
for
,
but
I
supposed
for
Steerforth
,
and
so
joined
in
them
ardently
,
though
I
felt
miserable
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Creakle
then
caned
Tommy
Traddles
for
being
discovered
in
tears
,
instead
of
cheers
,
on
account
of
Mr
Mell
's
departure
;
and
went
back
to
his
sofa
,
or
his
bed
,
or
wherever
he
had
come
from
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
left
to
ourselves
now
,
and
looked
very
blank
,
I
recollect
,
on
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
For
myself
,
I
felt
so
much
self
-
reproach
and
contrition
for
my
part
in
what
had
happened
,
that
nothing
would
have
enabled
me
to
keep
back
my
tears
but
the
fear
that
Steerforth
,
who
often
looked
at
me
,
I
saw
,
might
think
it
unfriendly
---
or
<EOS>
,
I
should
rather
say
,
considering
our
relative
ages
,
and
the
feeling
with
which
I
regarded
him
,
<EOS>
undutiful
---
if
I
showed
the
emotion
which
distressed
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
angry
with
Traddles
,
and
said
he
was
glad
he
had
caught
it
.
   
<EOS>
Poor
Traddles
,
who
had
passed
the
stage
of
lying
with
his
head
upon
the
desk
,
and
was
relieving
himself
as
usual
with
a
burst
of
skeletons
,
said
he
did
n't
care
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mell
was
ill
-
used
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
has
ill
-
used
him
,
you
girl
?
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
have
,
"
returned
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
done
?
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
done
?
"
<EOS>
retorted
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hurt
his
feelings
,
and
lost
him
his
situation
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
His
feelings
?
"
repeated
Steerforth
disdainfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
feelings
will
soon
get
the
better
of
it
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
 
<EOS>
His
feelings
are
not
like
yours
,
Miss
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
his
situation
---
which
was
a
precious
one
,
was
n't
it
?
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
do
you
suppose
I
am
not
going
to
write
home
,
and
take
care
that
he
gets
some
money
?
 
<EOS>
Polly
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
thought
this
intention
very
noble
in
Steerforth
,
whose
mother
was
a
widow
,
and
rich
,
and
would
do
almost
anything
,
it
was
said
,
that
he
asked
her
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
all
extremely
glad
to
see
Traddles
so
put
down
,
and
exalted
Steerforth
to
the
skies
:
especially
when
he
told
us
,
as
he
condescended
to
do
,
that
what
he
had
done
had
been
done
expressly
for
us
,
and
for
our
cause
;
and
that
he
had
conferred
a
great
boon
upon
us
by
unselfishly
doing
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
say
that
when
I
was
going
on
with
a
story
in
the
dark
that
night
,
Mr
Mell
's
old
flute
seemed
more
than
once
to
sound
mournfully
in
my
ears
;
and
that
when
at
last
Steerforth
was
tired
,
and
I
lay
down
in
my
bed
,
I
fancied
it
playing
so
sorrowfully
somewhere
,
that
I
was
quite
wretched
.
   
<EOS>
I
soon
forgot
him
in
the
contemplation
of
Steerforth
,
who
,
in
an
easy
amateur
way
,
and
without
any
book
(
he
seemed
to
me
to
know
everything
by
heart
)
,
took
some
of
his
classes
until
a
new
master
was
found
.
 
<EOS>
The
new
master
came
from
a
grammar
school
;
and
before
he
entered
on
his
duties
,
dined
in
the
parlour
one
day
,
to
be
introduced
to
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
Steerforth
approved
of
him
highly
,
and
told
us
he
was
a
Brick
.
 
<EOS>
Without
exactly
understanding
what
learned
distinction
was
meant
by
this
,
I
respected
him
greatly
for
it
,
and
had
no
doubt
whatever
of
his
superior
knowledge
:
though
he
never
took
the
pains
with
me
---
not
that
I
was
anybody
---
that
Mr
Mell
had
taken
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
only
one
other
event
in
this
half
-
year
,
out
of
the
daily
school
-
life
,
that
made
an
impression
upon
me
which
still
survives
.
<EOS>
It
survives
for
many
reasons
.
   
<EOS>
One
afternoon
,
when
we
were
all
harassed
into
a
state
of
dire
confusion
,
and
Mr
Creakle
was
laying
about
him
dreadfully
,
Tungay
came
in
,
and
called
out
in
his
usual
strong
way
:
"
Visitors
for
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
A
few
words
were
interchanged
between
him
and
Mr
Creakle
,
as
,
who
the
visitors
were
,
and
what
room
they
were
to
be
shown
into
;
and
then
I
,
who
had
,
according
to
custom
,
stood
up
on
the
announcement
being
made
,
and
felt
quite
faint
with
astonishment
,
was
told
to
go
by
the
back
stairs
and
get
a
clean
frill
on
,
before
I
repaired
to
the
dining
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
These
orders
I
obeyed
,
in
such
a
flutter
and
hurry
of
my
young
spirits
as
I
had
never
known
before
;
and
when
I
got
to
the
parlour
door
,
and
the
thought
came
into
my
head
that
it
might
be
my
mother
<EOS>
---
I
had
only
thought
of
Mr
or
Miss
Murdstone
until
then
---
I
drew
back
my
hand
from
the
lock
,
and
stopped
to
have
a
sob
before
I
went
in
.
   
<EOS>
At
first
I
saw
nobody
;
but
feeling
a
pressure
against
the
door
,
I
looked
round
it
,
and
there
,
to
my
amazement
,
were
Mr
Peggotty
and
Ham
,
ducking
at
me
with
their
hats
,
and
squeezing
one
another
against
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
laughing
;
but
it
was
much
more
in
the
pleasure
of
seeing
them
,
than
at
the
appearance
they
made
.
<EOS>
We
shook
hands
in
a
very
cordial
way
;
and
I
laughed
and
laughed
,
until
I
pulled
out
my
pocket
-
handkerchief
and
wiped
my
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
(
who
never
shut
his
mouth
once
,
I
remember
,
during
the
visit
)
showed
great
concern
when
he
saw
me
do
this
,
and
nudged
Ham
to
say
something
.
   
<EOS>
"
Cheer
up
,
Mas'r
Davy
bor
'
!
"
said
Ham
,
in
his
simpering
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
you
have
growed
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Am
I
grown
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
drying
my
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
crying
at
anything
in
particular
that
I
know
of
;
but
somehow
it
made
me
cry
,
to
see
old
friends
.
   
<EOS>
"
Growed
,
Mas'r
Davy
bor
'
?
 
<EOS>
Ai
n't
he
growed
!
"
said
Ham
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ai
n't
he
growed
!
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
They
made
me
laugh
again
by
laughing
at
each
other
,
and
then
we
all
three
laughed
until
I
was
in
danger
of
crying
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
how
mama
is
,
Mr
Peggotty
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
how
my
dear
,
dear
,
old
Peggotty
is
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oncommon
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
little
Em'ly
,
and
Mrs
Gummidge
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
---
common
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
silence
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
,
to
relieve
it
,
took
two
prodigious
lobsters
,
and
an
enormous
crab
,
and
a
large
canvas
bag
of
shrimps
,
out
of
his
pockets
,
and
piled
them
up
in
Ham
's
arms
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
knowing
as
you
was
partial
to
a
little
relish
with
your
wittles
when
you
was
along
with
us
,
we
took
the
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
Mawther
biled
'em
,
she
did
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
biled
'em
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
slowly
,
who
I
thought
appeared
to
stick
to
the
subject
on
account
of
having
no
other
subject
ready
,
"
Mrs
Gummidge
<EOS>
,
I
do
assure
you
,
she
biled
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
expressed
my
thanks
;
and
Mr
Peggotty
,
after
looking
at
Ham
,
who
stood
smiling
sheepishly
over
the
shellfish
,
without
making
any
attempt
to
help
him
,
said
:
   
"
We
come
,
you
see
,
the
wind
and
tide
making
in
our
favour
,
in
one
of
our
Yarmouth
lugs
to
Gravesen
'
.
 
<EOS>
My
sister
she
wrote
to
me
the
name
of
this
here
place
,
and
wrote
to
me
as
if
ever
I
chanced
to
come
to
Gravesen
'
,
I
was
to
come
over
and
inquire
for
Mas'r
Davy
and
give
her
dooty
,
humbly
wishing
him
well
and
reporting
of
the
fam'ly
as
they
was
oncommon
toe
-
be
-
sure
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Em'ly
,
you
see
,
she
'll
write
to
my
sister
when
I
go
back
,
as
I
see
you
and
as
you
was
similarly
oncommon
,
and
so
we
make
it
quite
a
merry
-
go
-
rounder
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
consider
a
little
before
I
understood
what
Mr
Peggotty
meant
by
this
figure
,
expressive
of
a
complete
circle
of
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
thanked
him
heartily
;
and
said
,
with
a
consciousness
of
reddening
,
that
I
supposed
little
Em'ly
was
altered
too
,
since
we
used
to
pick
up
shells
and
pebbles
on
the
beach
?
   
<EOS>
"
She
's
getting
to
be
a
woman
<EOS>
,
that
's
wot
<EOS>
she
's
getting
to
be
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ask
HIM
.
"
<EOS>
He
meant
Ham
,
who
beamed
with
delight
and
assent
over
the
bag
of
shrimps
.
   
<EOS>
"
Her
pretty
face
!
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
with
his
own
shining
like
a
light
.
   
<EOS>
"
Her
learning
!
<EOS>
"
said
Ham
.
   
<EOS>
"
Her
writing
!
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
it
's
as
black
as
jet
!
 
<EOS>
And
so
large
it
is
,
you
might
see
it
anywheres
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
perfectly
delightful
to
behold
with
what
enthusiasm
Mr
Peggotty
became
inspired
when
he
thought
of
his
little
favourite
.
<EOS>
He
stands
before
me
again
,
his
bluff
hairy
face
irradiating
with
a
joyful
love
and
pride
,
for
which
I
can
find
no
description
.
 
<EOS>
His
honest
eyes
fire
up
,
and
sparkle
,
as
if
their
depths
were
stirred
by
something
bright
.
 
<EOS>
His
broad
chest
heaves
with
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
His
strong
loose
hands
clench
themselves
,
in
his
earnestness
;
and
he
emphasizes
what
he
says
with
a
right
arm
that
shows
,
in
my
pigmy
view
,
like
a
sledge
-
hammer
.
   
<EOS>
Ham
was
quite
as
earnest
as
he
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
they
would
have
said
much
more
about
her
,
if
they
had
not
been
abashed
by
the
unexpected
coming
in
of
Steerforth
,
who
,
seeing
me
in
a
corner
speaking
with
two
strangers
,
stopped
in
a
song
he
was
singing
,
and
said
:
"
I
did
n't
know
you
were
here
,
young
Copperfield
!
"
<EOS>
(
for
it
was
not
the
usual
visiting
room
)
and
crossed
by
us
on
his
way
out
.
   
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
whether
it
was
in
the
pride
of
having
such
a
friend
as
Steerforth
,
or
in
the
desire
to
explain
to
him
how
I
came
to
have
such
a
friend
as
Mr
Peggotty
<EOS>
,
that
I
called
to
him
as
he
was
going
away
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
said
,
modestly
---
<EOS>
Good
Heaven
,
how
it
all
comes
back
to
me
this
long
time
afterwards
!
<EOS>
---
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
go
,
Steerforth
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
These
are
two
Yarmouth
boatmen
---
very
kind
,
good
people
---
who
are
relations
of
my
nurse
,
and
have
come
from
Gravesend
to
see
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
?
<EOS>
"
said
Steerforth
,
returning
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
see
them
.
<EOS>
How
are
you
both
?
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
an
ease
in
his
manner
---
a
gay
and
light
manner
it
was
,
but
not
swaggering
---
which
I
still
believe
to
have
borne
a
kind
of
enchantment
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
still
believe
him
,
in
virtue
of
this
carriage
,
his
animal
spirits
,
his
delightful
voice
,
his
handsome
face
and
figure
,
and
,
for
aught
I
know
,
of
some
inborn
power
of
attraction
besides
(
which
I
think
a
few
people
possess
)
,
to
have
carried
a
spell
with
him
to
which
it
was
a
natural
weakness
to
yield
,
and
which
not
many
persons
could
withstand
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
see
how
pleased
they
were
with
him
,
and
how
they
seemed
to
open
their
hearts
to
him
in
a
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
let
them
know
at
home
,
<EOS>
if
you
please
,
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
when
that
letter
is
sent
,
that
Mr
Steerforth
is
very
kind
to
me
,
and
that
I
do
n't
know
what
I
should
ever
do
here
without
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
"
said
Steerforth
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
n't
tell
them
anything
of
the
sort
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
if
Mr
Steerforth
ever
comes
into
Norfolk
or
Suffolk
,
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
while
I
am
there
,
you
may
depend
upon
it
I
shall
bring
him
to
Yarmouth
,
if
he
will
let
me
,
to
see
your
house
.
<EOS>
You
never
saw
such
a
good
house
,
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
made
out
of
a
boat
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Made
out
of
a
boat
,
is
it
?
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
right
sort
of
a
house
for
such
a
thorough
-
built
boatman
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
'
tis
,
sir
,
so
'
tis
,
sir
,
"
said
Ham
,
grinning
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
right
,
young
gen'l'm'n
!
 
<EOS>
Mas'r
Davy

,
gen'l'm'n

A

<EOS>
Hor
,
hor
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
he
is
,
too
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
was
no
less
pleased
than
his
nephew
,
though
his
modesty
forbade
him
to
claim
a
personal
compliment
so
vociferously
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
bowing
and
chuckling
,
and
tucking
in
the
ends
of
his
neckerchief
at
his
breast
:
<EOS>
"
I
thankee
,
sir
,
I
thankee
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
my
endeavours
in
my
line
of
life
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
best
of
men
can
do
no
more
,
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
<EOS>
He
had
got
his
name
already
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
pound
it
,
it
's
wot
<EOS>
you
do
yourself
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
and
wot
<EOS>
you
do
well
---
right
well
!
 
<EOS>
I
thankee
,
sir

<EOS>
I
'm
obleeged
to
you
,
sir
,
for
your
welcoming
manner
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
'm
rough
,
sir
,
but
I
'm
ready

<EOS>
least
ways
,
I
hope
I
'm
ready
,
you
unnerstand
.
 
<EOS>
My
house
ai
n't
much
for
to
see
,
sir
,
but
it
's
hearty
at
your
service
if
ever
you
should
come
along
with
Mas'r
Davy
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
reg'lar
Dodman
<EOS>
,
I
am
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
by
which
he
meant
snail
,
and
this
was
in
allusion
to
his
being
slow
to
go
,
for
he
had
attempted
to
go
after
every
sentence
,
and
had
somehow
or
other
come
back
again
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
wish
you
both
well
,
and
I
wish
you
happy
!
"
   
<EOS>
Ham
echoed
this
sentiment
,
and
we
parted
with
them
in
the
heartiest
manner
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
almost
tempted
that
evening
to
tell
Steerforth
about
pretty
little
Em'ly
,
but
I
was
too
timid
of
mentioning
her
name
,
and
too
much
afraid
of
his
laughing
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
that
I
thought
a
good
deal
,
and
in
an
uneasy
sort
of
way
,
about
Mr
Peggotty
having
said
that
she
was
getting
on
to
be
a
woman
;
but
I
decided
that
was
nonsense
.
   
<EOS>
We
transported
the
shellfish
,
or
the
"
relish
"
as
Mr
Peggotty
had
modestly
called
it
,
up
into
our
room
unobserved
,
and
made
a
great
supper
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
But
Traddles
could
n't
get
happily
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
too
unfortunate
even
to
come
through
a
supper
like
anybody
else
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
taken
ill
in
the
night
---
quite
prostrate
he
was
---
in
consequence
of
Crab
;
and
after
being
drugged
with
black
draughts
and
blue
pills
,
to
an
extent
which
Demple
(
whose
father
was
a
doctor
)
said
was
enough
to
undermine
a
horse
's
constitution
,
received
a
caning
and
six
chapters
of
Greek
Testament
for
refusing
to
confess
.
   
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
half
-
year
is
a
jumble
in
my
recollection
of
the
daily
strife
and
struggle
of
our
lives
;
of
the
waning
summer
and
the
changing
season
;
of
the
frosty
mornings
when
we
were
rung
out
of
bed
,
and
the
cold
,
cold
smell
of
the
dark
nights
when
we
were
rung
into
bed
again
;
of
the
evening
schoolroom
dimly
lighted
and
indifferently
warmed
,
and
the
morning
schoolroom
which
was
nothing
but
a
great
shivering
-
machine
;
of
the
alternation
of
boiled
beef
with
roast
beef
,
and
boiled
mutton
with
roast
mutton
;
of
clods
of
bread
-
and
-
butter
,
dog's
-
eared
lesson
-
books
,
cracked
slates
,
tear
-
blotted
copy
-
books
,
canings
,
rulerings
,
hair
-
cuttings
,
rainy
Sundays
,
suet
-
puddings
,
and
a
dirty
atmosphere
of
ink
,
surrounding
all
.
   
<EOS>
I
well
remember
though
,
how
the
distant
idea
of
the
holidays
,
after
seeming
for
an
immense
time
to
be
a
stationary
speck
,
began
to
come
towards
us
,
and
to
grow
and
grow
.
 
<EOS>
How
from
counting
months
,
we
came
to
weeks
,
and
then
to
days
;
and
how
I
then
began
to
be
afraid
that
I
should
not
be
sent
for
and
when
I
learnt
from
Steerforth
that
I
had
been
sent
for
,
and
was
certainly
to
go
home
,
had
dim
forebodings
that
I
might
break
my
leg
first
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
breaking
-
up
day
changed
its
place
fast
,
at
last
,
from
the
week
after
next
to
next
week
,
this
week
,
the
day
after
tomorrow
,
tomorrow
,
today
,
tonight
---
when
I
was
inside
the
Yarmouth
mail
,
and
going
home
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
many
a
broken
sleep
inside
the
Yarmouth
mail
,
and
many
an
incoherent
dream
of
all
these
things
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
I
awoke
at
intervals
,
the
ground
outside
the
window
was
not
the
playground
of
Salem
House
,
and
the
sound
in
my
ears
was
not
the
sound
of
Mr
Creakle
giving
it
to
Traddles
,
but
the
sound
of
the
coachman
touching
up
the
horses
.

Chapter

.
<EOS>
My
holidays
.
 
<EOS>
Especially
one
happy
afternoon
 
<EOS>
When
we
arrived
before
day
at
the
inn
where
the
mail
stopped
,
which
was
not
the
inn
where
my
friend
the
waiter
lived
,
I
was
shown
up
to
a
nice
little
bedroom
,
with
DOLPHIN
painted
on
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Very
cold
I
was
,
I
know
,
notwithstanding
the
hot
tea
they
had
given
me
before
a
large
fire
downstairs
;
and
very
glad
I
was
to
turn
into
the
Dolphin
's
bed
,
pull
the
Dolphin
's
blankets
<EOS>
round
my
head
,
and
go
to
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
the
carrier
was
to
call
for
me
in
the
morning
at
nine
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
up
at
eight
,
a
little
giddy
from
the
shortness
of
my
night
's
rest
,
and
was
ready
for
him
before
the
appointed
time
.
<EOS>
He
received
me
exactly
as
if
not
five
minutes
had
elapsed
since
we
were
last
together
,
and
I
had
only
been
into
the
hotel
to
get
change
for
sixpence
,
or
something
of
that
sort
.
   
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
and
my
box
were
in
the
cart
,
and
the
carrier
seated
,
the
lazy
horse
walked
away
with
us
all
at
his
accustomed
pace
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
look
very
well
,
Mr
Barkis
,
"
I
said
,
thinking
he
would
like
to
know
it
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
rubbed
his
cheek
with
his
cuff
,
and
then
looked
at
his
cuff
as
if
he
expected
to
find
some
of
the
bloom
upon
it
;
but
made
no
other
acknowledgement
of
the
compliment
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
gave
your
message
,
Mr
Barkis
,
"
I
said
:
"
I
wrote
to
Peggotty
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr
Barkis
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
seemed
gruff
,
and
answered
drily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Was
n't
it
right
,
Mr
Barkis
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
after
a
little
hesitation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
no
,
"
said
Mr
Barkis
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
the
message
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
message
was
right
enough
,
perhaps
,
"
said
Mr
Barkis
;
"
but
it
come
to
an
end
there
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Not
understanding
what
he
meant
,
I
repeated
inquisitively
:
"
Came
to
an
end
,
Mr
Barkis
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
come
of
it
,
"
he
explained
,
looking
at
me
sideways
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
answer
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
was
an
answer
expected
,
was
there
,
Mr
Barkis
?
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
opening
my
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
was
a
new
light
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
a
man
says
he
's
willin
'
,
"
said
Mr
Barkis
,
turning
his
glance
slowly
on
me
again
,
"
it
's
as
much
as
to
say
,
that
man
's
a
-
waitin
'
for
a
answer
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr
Barkis
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr
Barkis
,
carrying
his
eyes
back
to
his
horse
's
ears
;
"
that
man
's
been
a
-
waitin
'
for
a
answer
ever
since
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
told
her
so
,
Mr
Barkis
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
<EOS>
---
no
,
"
growled
Mr
Barkis
,
reflecting
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ai
n't
got
no
call
to
go
and
tell
her
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
said
six
words
to
her
myself
,
<EOS>
I
ai
n't
a
-
goin
'
to
tell
her
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
like
me
to
do
it
,
Mr
Barkis
?
"
said
I
,
doubtfully
.
<EOS>
"
You
might
tell
her
,
if
you
would
,
"
said
Mr
Barkis
,
with
another
slow
look
at
me
,
"
that
Barkis
was
a
-
waitin
'
for
a
answer
.
 
<EOS>
Says
you
---
what
name
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Her
name
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr
Barkis
,
with
a
nod
of
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Peggotty
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Chrisen
name
?
 
<EOS>
Or
nat'ral
name
?
"
said
Mr
Barkis
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
it
's
not
her
Christian
name
.
 
<EOS>
Her
Christian
name
is
Clara
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
though
?
"
said
Mr
Barkis
.
   
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
find
an
immense
fund
of
reflection
in
this
circumstance
,
and
sat
pondering
and
inwardly
whistling
for
some
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
<EOS>
he
resumed
at
length
.
 
<EOS>
"
Says
you
,
"
Peggotty
!
 
<EOS>
Barkis
is
waitin
'
for
a
answer
.
"
 
<EOS>
Says
she
,
perhaps
,
"
Answer
to
what
?
"
 
<EOS>
Says
you
,
"
<EOS>
To
what
I
told
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
?
"
says
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
Barkis
is
willin
'
,
"
says
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
extremely
artful
suggestion
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
accompanied
with
a
nudge
of
his
elbow
that
gave
me
quite
a
stitch
in
my
side
.
 
<EOS>
After
that
,
he
slouched
over
his
horse
in
his
usual
manner
;
and
made
no
other
reference
to
the
subject
except
,
half
an
hour
afterwards
,
taking
a
piece
of
chalk
from
his
pocket
,
and
writing
up
,
inside
the
tilt
of
the
cart
,
"
Clara
Peggotty
"
---
apparently
as
a
private
memorandum
.
   
<EOS>
Ah
,
what
a
strange
feeling
it
was
to
be
going
home
when
it
was
not
home
,
and
to
find
that
every
object
I
looked
at
,
reminded
me
of
the
happy
old
home
,
which
was
like
a
dream
I
could
never
dream
again
!
<EOS>
The
days
when
my
mother
and
I
and
Peggotty
were
all
in
all
to
one
another
,
and
there
was
no
one
to
come
between
us
,
rose
up
before
me
so
sorrowfully
on
the
road
,
that
I
am
not
sure
I
was
glad
to
be
there
---
not
sure
but
that
I
would
rather
have
remained
away
,
and
forgotten
it
in
Steerforth
's
company
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
I
was
;
and
soon
I
was
at
our
house
,
where
the
bare
old
elm
-
trees
wrung
their
many
hands
in
the
bleak
wintry
air
,
and
shreds
of
the
old
rooks'-nests
drifted
away
upon
the
wind
.
   
<EOS>
The
carrier
put
my
box
down
at
the
garden
-
gate
,
and
left
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
along
the
path
towards
the
house
,
glancing
at
the
windows
,
and
fearing
at
every
step
to
see
Mr
Murdstone
or
Miss
Murdstone
lowering
out
of
one
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
No
face
appeared
,
however
;
and
being
come
to
the
house
,
and
knowing
how
to
open
the
door
,
before
dark
,
without
knocking
<EOS>
,
I
went
in
with
a
quiet
,
timid
step
.
   
<EOS>
God
knows
how
infantine
the
memory
may
have
been
,
that
was
awakened
within
me
by
the
sound
of
my
mother
's
voice
in
the
old
parlour
,
when
I
set
foot
in
the
hall
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
singing
in
a
low
tone
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
must
have
lain
in
her
arms
,
and
heard
her
singing
so
to
me
when
I
was
but
a
baby
.
 
<EOS>
The
strain
was
new
to
me
,
and
yet
it
was
so
old
that
it
filled
my
heart
brim
-
full
<EOS>
;
like
a
friend
come
back
from
a
long
absence
.
   
<EOS>
I
believed
,
from
the
solitary
and
thoughtful
way
in
which
my
mother
murmured
her
song
,
that
she
was
alone
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
went
softly
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
sitting
by
the
fire
,
suckling
an
infant
,
whose
tiny
hand
she
held
against
her
neck
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
looking
down
upon
its
face
,
and
she
sat
singing
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
far
right
,
that
she
had
no
other
companion
.
   
<EOS>
I
spoke
to
her
,
and
she
started
,
and
cried
out
.
 
<EOS>
But
seeing
me
,
she
called
me
her
dear
Davy
,
her
own
boy
!
<EOS>
and
coming
half
across
the
room
to
meet
me
,
kneeled
down
upon
the
ground
and
kissed
me
,
and
laid
my
head
down
on
her
bosom
near
the
little
creature
that
was
nestling
there
,
and
put
its
hand
to
my
lips
.
   
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
died
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
died
then
,
with
that
feeling
in
my
heart
!
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
more
fit
for
Heaven
than
I
ever
have
been
since
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
your
brother
,
"
said
my
mother
,
fondling
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Davy
,
my
pretty
boy
!
 
<EOS>
My
poor
child
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
she
kissed
me
more
and
more
,
and
clasped
me
round
the
neck
.
 
<EOS>
This
she
was
doing
when
Peggotty
came
running
in
,
and
bounced
down
on
the
ground
beside
us
,
and
went
mad
about
us
both
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
   
<EOS>
It
seemed
that
I
had
not
been
expected
so
soon
,
the
carrier
being
much
before
his
usual
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
,
too
,
that
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
had
gone
out
upon
a
visit
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
would
not
return
before
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
never
hoped
for
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
never
thought
it
possible
that
we
three
could
be
together
undisturbed
,
once
more
;
and
I
felt
,
for
the
time
,
as
if
the
old
days
were
come
back
.
   
<EOS>
We
dined
together
by
the
fireside
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
was
in
attendance
to
wait
upon
us
,
but
my
mother
would
n't
let
her
do
it
,
and
made
her
dine
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
my
own
old
plate
,
with
a
brown
view
of
a
man
-
of
-
war
in
full
sail
upon
it
,
which
Peggotty
had
hoarded
somewhere
all
the
time
I
had
been
away
,
and
would
not
have
had
broken
,
she
said
,
for
a
hundred
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
my
own
old
mug
with
David
on
it
,
and
my
own
old
little
knife
and
fork
that
would
n't
cut
.
   
<EOS>
While
we
were
at
table
,
I
thought
it
a
favourable
occasion
to
tell
Peggotty
about
Mr
Barkis
,
who
,
before
I
had
finished
what
I
had
to
tell
her
,
began
to
laugh
,
and
throw
her
apron
over
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Peggotty
,
"
said
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
only
laughed
the
more
,
and
held
her
apron
tight
over
her
face
when
my
mother
tried
to
pull
it
away
,
and
sat
as
if
her
head
were
in
a
bag
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
doing
,
you
stupid
creature
?
"
said
my
mother
,
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
drat
the
man
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
wants
to
marry
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
very
good
match
for
you
;
would
n't
it
?
"
said
my
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
ask
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
him
if
he
was
made
of
gold
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
I
would
n't
have
anybody
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
why
do
n't
you
tell
him
so
,
you
ridiculous
thing
?
"
said
my
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
so
,
"
retorted
Peggotty
,
looking
out
of
her
apron
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
never
said
a
word
to
me
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
knows
better
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
was
to
make
so
bold
as
say
a
word
to
me
,
I
should
slap
his
face
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
own
was
as
red
as
ever
<EOS>
I
saw
it
,
or
any
other
face
,
I
think
;
but
she
only
covered
it
again
,
for
a
few
moments
at
a
time
,
when
she
was
taken
with
a
violent
fit
of
laughter
;
and
after
two
or
three
of
those
attacks
,
went
on
with
her
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
I
remarked
that
my
mother
,
though
she
smiled
when
Peggotty
looked
at
her
,
became
more
serious
and
thoughtful
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
seen
at
first
that
she
was
changed
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
was
very
pretty
still
,
but
it
looked
careworn
,
and
too
delicate
;
and
her
hand
was
so
thin
and
white
<EOS>
that
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
almost
transparent
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
change
to
which
I
now
refer
was
superadded
to
this
:
it
was
in
her
manner
,
which
became
anxious
and
fluttered
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
she
said
,
putting
out
her
hand
,
and
laying
it
affectionately
on
the
hand
of
her
old
servant
,
   
<EOS>
"
Peggotty
,
dear
,
you
are
not
going
to
be
married
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Me
,
ma'am
?
"
returned
Peggotty
,
staring
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
you
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
just
yet
?
"
said
my
mother
,
tenderly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
cried
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
My
mother
took
her
hand
,
and
said
:
   
"
Do
n't
leave
me
,
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
for
long
,
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
What
should
I
ever
do
without
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Me
leave
you
,
my
precious
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
for
all
the
world
and
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
what
's
put
that
in
your
silly
little
head
?
"
<EOS>
---
For
Peggotty
had
been
used
of
old
to
talk
to
my
mother
sometimes
like
a
child
.
   
<EOS>
But
my
mother
made
no
answer
,
except
to
thank
her
,
and
Peggotty
went
running
on
in
her
own
fashion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Me
leave
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
see
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
go
away
from
you
?
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
catch
her
at
it
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
shaking
her
head
,
and
folding
her
arms
;
"
not
she
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
n't
that
there
ai
n't
some
Cats
that
would
be
well
enough
pleased
if
she
did
,
but
they
sha'n't
be
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
They
shall
be
aggravated
.
<EOS>
I
'll
stay
with
you
till
I
am
a
cross
cranky
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
'm
too
deaf
,
and
too
lame
,
and
too
blind
,
and
too
mumbly
for
want
of
teeth
,
to
be
of
any
use
at
all
,
even
to
be
found
fault
with
,
than
I
shall
go
to
my
Davy
,
and
ask
him
to
take
me
in
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
,
Peggotty
,
"
says
I
,
"
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
,
and
I
'll
make
you
as
welcome
as
a
queen
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
your
dear
heart
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
will
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
kissed
me
beforehand
,
in
grateful
acknowledgement
of
my
hospitality
.
 
<EOS>
After
that
,
she
covered
her
head
up
with
her
apron
again
and
had
another
laugh
about
Mr
Barkis
.
 
<EOS>
After
that
,
she
took
the
baby
out
of
its
little
cradle
,
and
nursed
it
.
 
<EOS>
After
that
,
she
cleared
the
dinner
table
;
after
that
,
came
in
with
another
cap
on
,
and
her
work
-
box
,
and
the
yard
-
measure
,
and
the
bit
of
wax
-
candle
,
all
just
the
same
as
ever
.
   
<EOS>
We
sat
round
the
fire
,
and
talked
delightfully
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
them
what
a
hard
master
Mr
Creakle
was
,
and
they
pitied
me
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
them
what
a
fine
fellow
Steerforth
was
,
and
what
a
patron
of
mine
,
and
Peggotty
said
she
would
walk
a
score
of
miles
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
I
took
the
little
baby
in
my
arms
when
it
was
awake
,
and
nursed
it
lovingly
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
was
asleep
again
,
I
crept
close
to
my
mother
's
side
according
to
my
old
custom
,
broken
now
a
long
time
,
and
sat
with
my
arms
embracing
her
waist
,
and
my
little
red
cheek
on
her
shoulder
,
and
once
more
felt
her
beautiful
hair
drooping
over
me
---
like
an
angel
's
wing
as
I
used
to
think
,
I
recollect
---
and
was
very
happy
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
While
I
sat
thus
,
looking
at
the
fire
,
and
seeing
pictures
in
the
red
-
hot
coals
,
I
almost
believed
that
I
had
never
been
away
;
that
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
were
such
pictures
,
and
would
vanish
when
the
fire
got
low
;
and
that
there
was
nothing
real
in
all
that
I
remembered
,
save
my
mother
,
Peggotty
,
and
I.
   
Peggotty
<EOS>
darned
away
at
a
stocking
as
long
as
she
could
see
,
and
then
sat
with
it
drawn
on
her
left
hand
like
a
glove
,
and
her
needle
in
her
right
,
ready
to
take
another
stitch
whenever
there
was
a
blaze
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
conceive
whose
stockings
they
can
have
been
that
Peggotty
was
always
darning
,
or
where
such
an
unfailing
supply
of
stockings
in
want
of
darning
can
have
come
from
.
 
<EOS>
From
my
earliest
infancy
she
seems
to
have
been
always
employed
in
that
class
of
needlework
,
and
never
by
any
chance
in
any
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
who
was
sometimes
seized
with
a
fit
of
wondering
on
some
most
unexpected
topic
,
"
what
's
become
of
Davy
's
great
-
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Lor
,
Peggotty
!
"
observed
my
mother
,
rousing
herself
from
a
reverie
,
"
what
nonsense
you
talk
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
I
really
do
wonder
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
can
have
put
such
a
person
in
your
head
?
"
inquired
my
mother
.
<EOS>
"
Is
there
nobody
else
in
the
world
to
come
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
"
unless
it
's
on
account
of
being
stupid
,
but
my
head
never
can
pick
and
choose
its
people
.
<EOS>
They
come
and
they
go
,
and
they
do
n't
come
and
they
do
n't
go
,
just
as
they
like
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
's
become
of
her
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
absurd
you
are
,
Peggotty
!
"
returned
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
would
suppose
you
wanted
a
second
visit
from
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
forbid
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
do
n't
talk
about
such
uncomfortable
things
,
there
's
a
good
soul
,
"
said
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Betsey
is
shut
up
in
her
cottage
by
the
sea
,
no
doubt
,
and
will
remain
there
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
she
is
not
likely
ever
to
trouble
us
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
mused
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
that
ai
n't
likely
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
---
I
wonder
,
if
she
was
to
die
,
whether
she
'd
leave
Davy
anything
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
me
,
Peggotty
,
"
returned
my
mother
,
"
what
a
nonsensical
woman
you
are
!
<EOS>
when
you
know
that
she
took
offence
at
the
poor
dear
boy
's
ever
being
born
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
she
would
n't
be
inclined
to
forgive
him
now
,
"
hinted
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
should
she
be
inclined
to
forgive
him
now
?
"
said
my
mother
,
rather
sharply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
that
he
's
got
a
brother
,
I
mean
,
"
said
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
MY
mother
immediately
began
to
cry
,
and
wondered
how
Peggotty
dared
to
say
such
a
thing
.
   
<EOS>
"
As
if
this
poor
little
innocent
in
its
cradle
had
ever
done
any
harm
to
you
or
anybody
else
,
you
jealous
thing
!
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
much
better
go
and
marry
Mr
Barkis
,
the
carrier
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
?
"
   
"
I
should
make
Miss
Murdstone
happy
,
if
I
was
to
,
"
said
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
bad
disposition
you
have
,
Peggotty
!
"
returned
my
mother
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
as
jealous
of
Miss
Murdstone
as
it
is
possible
for
a
ridiculous
creature
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
You
want
to
keep
the
keys
yourself
,
and
give
out
all
the
things
,
I
suppose
?
 
<EOS>
I
should
n't
be
surprised
if
you
did
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
know
that
she
only
does
it
out
of
kindness
and
the
best
intentions
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
she
does
,
Peggotty
---
you
know
it
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
muttered
something
to
the
effect
of
"
Bother
the
best
intentions
!
"
<EOS>
and
something
else
to
the
effect
that
there
was
a
little
too
much
of
the
best
intentions
going
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
you
mean
,
you
cross
thing
,
"
said
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
,
Peggotty
,
perfectly
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
I
do
,
and
I
wonder
you
do
n't
colour
up
like
fire
.
 
<EOS>
But
one
point
at
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
is
the
point
now
,
<EOS>
Peggotty
,
and
you
sha'n't
escape
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
Have
n't
you
heard
her
say
,
over
and
over
again
,
that
she
thinks
I
am
too
thoughtless
and
too
---
a
---
a
---
"
   
"
Pretty
,
"
suggested
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
returned
my
mother
,
half
laughing
,
"
and
if
she
is
so
silly
as
to
say
so
,
can
I
be
blamed
for
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
one
says
you
can
,
"
said
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
should
hope
not
,
indeed
!
"
returned
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
n't
you
heard
her
say
,
over
and
over
again
,
that
on
this
account
she
wished
to
spare
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
,
which
she
thinks
I
am
not
suited
for
,
and
which
I
really
do
n't
know
myself
that
I
AM
suited
for
;
and
is
n't
she
up
early
and
late
,
and
going
to
and
fro
continually
---
and
does
n't
she
do
all
sorts
of
things
,
and
grope
into
all
sorts
of
places
,
coal
-
holes
and
pantries
<EOS>
and
I
do
n't
know
where
,
that
ca
n't
be
very
agreeable
---
and
do
you
mean
to
insinuate
that
there
is
not
a
sort
of
devotion
in
that
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
insinuate
at
all
,
"
said
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
,
Peggotty
,
"
returned
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
never
do
anything
else
,
except
your
work
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
always
insinuating
.
 
<EOS>
You
revel
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
you
talk
of
Mr
Murdstone
's
good
intentions
---
"
   
"
I
never
talked
of
'
em
,
"
said
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Peggotty
,
"
returned
my
mother
,
"
but
you
insinuated
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
told
you
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
worst
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
WILL
insinuate
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
at
the
moment
,
that
I
understood
you
,
and
you
see
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
talk
of
Mr
Murdstone
's
good
intentions
,
and
pretend
to
slight
them
(
for
I
do
n't
believe
you
really
do
,
in
your
heart
,
Peggotty
)
,
you
must
be
as
well
convinced
as
I
am
how
good
they
are
,
and
how
they
actuate
him
in
everything
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
seems
to
have
been
at
all
stern
with
a
certain
person
,
Peggotty
---
you
understand
,
and
so
I
am
sure
does
Davy
,
that
I
am
not
alluding
to
anybody
present
---
it
is
solely
because
he
is
satisfied
that
it
is
for
a
certain
person
's
benefit
.
 
<EOS>
He
naturally
loves
a
certain
person
,
on
my
account
;
and
acts
solely
for
a
certain
person
's
good
.
<EOS>
He
is
better
able
to
judge
of
it
than
I
am
;
for
I
very
well
know
that
I
am
a
weak
,
light
,
girlish
creature
,
and
that
he
is
a
firm
,
grave
,
serious
man
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
takes

"
said
my
mother
,
with
the
tears
which
were
engendered
in
her
affectionate
nature
,
stealing
down
her
face
,
"
he
takes
great
pains
with
me
;
and
I
ought
to
be
very
thankful
to
him
,
and
very
submissive
to
him
even
in
my
thoughts
;
and
when
I
am
not
,
Peggotty
,
I
worry
and
condemn
myself
,
and
feel
doubtful
of
my
own
heart
,
and
do
n't
know
what
to
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
sat
with
her
chin
on
the
foot
of
the
stocking
,
looking
silently
at
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
Peggotty
,
"
said
my
mother
,
changing
her
tone
,
"
do
n't
let
us
fall
out
with
one
another

for
I
could
n't
bear
it

You
are
my
true

I
know
,
if
I
have
any
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
call
you
a
ridiculous
creature
,
or
a
vexatious
thing
,
or
anything
of
that
sort
,
Peggotty
<EOS>
,
I
only
mean
that
you
are
my
true
friend
,
and
always
have
been
,
ever
since
the
night
when
Mr
Copperfield
first
brought
me
home
here
,
and
you
came
out
to
the
gate
to
meet
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
was
not
slow
to
respond
,
and
ratify
the
treaty
of
friendship
by
giving
me
one
of
her
best
hugs
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
had
some
glimpses
of
the
real
character
of
this
conversation
at
the
time
;
but
I
am
sure
,
now
,
that
the
good
creature
originated
it
,
and
took
her
part
in
it
,
merely
that
my
mother
might
comfort
herself
with
the
little
contradictory
summary
in
which
she
had
indulged
.
 
<EOS>
The
design
was
efficacious
;
for
I
remember
that
my
mother
seemed
more
at
ease
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
,
and
that
Peggotty
observed
her
less
.
   
<EOS>
When
we
had
had
our
tea
,
and
the
ashes
were
thrown
up
,
and
the
candles
snuffed
<EOS>
,
I
read
Peggotty
a
chapter
out
of
the
Crocodile
Book
,
in
remembrance
of
old
times
---
she
took
it
out
of
her
pocket
:
I
do
n't
know
whether
she
had
kept
it
there
ever
since
---
<EOS>
and
then
we
talked
about
Salem
House
,
which
brought
me
round
again
to
Steerforth
,
who
was
my
great
subject
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
very
happy
;
and
that
evening
,
as
the
last
of
its
race
,
and
destined
evermore
to
close
that
volume
of
my
life
,
will
never
pass
out
of
my
memory
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
almost
ten
o'clock
before
we
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
got
up
then
;
and
my
mother
said
hurriedly
that
,
as
it
was
so
late
,
and
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
approved
of
early
hours
for
young
people
,
perhaps
I
had
better
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
kissed
her
,
and
went
upstairs
with
my
candle
directly
,
before
they
came
in
.
 
<EOS>
It
appeared
to
my
childish
fancy
,
as
I
ascended
to
the
bedroom
where
I
had
been
imprisoned
,
that
they
brought
a
cold
blast
of
air
into
the
house
which
blew
away
the
old
familiar
feeling
like
a
feather
.
   
<EOS>
I
felt
uncomfortable
about
going
down
to
breakfast
in
the
morning
,
as
I
had
never
set
eyes
on
Mr
Murdstone
since
the
day
when
I
committed
my
memorable
offence
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
as
it
must
be
done
,
I
went
down
,
after
two
or
three
false
starts
half
-
way
,
and
as
many
runs
back
on
tiptoe
to
my
own
room
,
and
presented
myself
in
the
parlour
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
standing
before
the
fire
with
his
back
to
it
,
while
Miss
Murdstone
made
the
tea
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
steadily
as
I
entered
,
but
made
no
sign
of
recognition
whatever
.
<EOS>
I
went
up
to
him
,
after
a
moment
of
confusion
,
and
said
:
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
sorry
for
what
I
did
,
and
I
hope
you
will
forgive
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
you
are
sorry
,
David
,
"
he
replied
.
   
<EOS>
The
hand
he
gave
me
was
the
hand
I
had
bitten
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
restrain
my
eye
from
resting
for
an
instant
on
a
red
spot
upon
it
;
but
it
was
not
so
red
as
I
turned
,
when
I
met
that
sinister
expression
in
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
to
Miss
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
dear
me
!
"
sighed
Miss
Murdstone
,
giving
me
the
tea
-
caddy
scoop
instead
of
her
fingers
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
long
are
the
holidays
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
month
,
ma'am
.
"
   
"
Counting
from
when
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
From
today
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
here
's
one
day
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
kept
a
calendar
of
the
holidays
in
this
way
,
and
every
morning
checked
a
day
off
in
exactly
the
same
manner
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
it
gloomily
until
she
came
to
ten
,
but
when
she
got
into
two
figures
she
became
more
hopeful
,
and
,
as
the
time
advanced
,
even
jocular
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
on
this
very
first
day
that
I
had
the
misfortune
to
throw
her
,
though
she
was
not
subject
to
such
weakness
in
general
,
into
a
state
of
violent
consternation
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
into
the
room
where
she
and
my
mother
were
sitting
;
and
the
baby
(
who
was
only
a
few
weeks
old
)
being
on
my
mother
's
lap
<EOS>
,
I
took
it
very
carefully
in
my
arms
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
Miss
Murdstone
gave
such
a
scream
that
I
all
but
dropped
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Jane
!
"
cried
my
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
heavens
,
Clara
,
do
you
see
?
"
exclaimed
Miss
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
See
what
,
my
dear
Jane
?
"
said
my
mother
;
"
where
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
got
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miss
Murdstone
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
boy
has
got
the
baby
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
limp
with
horror
;
but
stiffened
herself
to
make
a
dart
at
me
,
and
take
it
out
of
my
arms
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
she
turned
faint
;
and
was
so
very
ill
that
they
were
obliged
to
give
her
cherry
brandy
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
solemnly
interdicted
by
her
,
on
her
recovery
,
from
touching
my
brother
any
more
on
any
pretence
whatever
;
and
my
poor
mother
,
who
,
I
could
see
,
wished
otherwise
,
meekly
confirmed
the
interdict
,
by
saying
:
"
No
doubt
you
are
right
,
my
dear
Jane
.
"
   
<EOS>
On
another
occasion
,
when
we
three
were
together
,
this
same
dear
baby
---
it
was
truly
dear
to
me
,
for
our
mother
's
sake
---
<EOS>
was
the
innocent
occasion
of
Miss
Murdstone
's
going
into
a
passion
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
,
who
had
been
looking
at
its
eyes
as
it
lay
upon
her
lap
,
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Davy
!
come
here
!
"
and
looked
at
mine
.
   
<EOS>
I
saw
Miss
Murdstone
lay
her
beads
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
declare
,
"
said
my
mother
,
gently
,
"
they
are
exactly
alike
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
are
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
they
are
the
colour
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
are
wonderfully
alike
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
talking
about
,
Clara
?
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Jane
,
"
faltered
my
mother
,
a
little
abashed
by
the
harsh
tone
of
this
inquiry
,
"
I
find
that
the
baby
's
eyes
and
Davy
's
are
exactly
alike
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Clara
!
<EOS>
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
rising
angrily
,
"
you
are
a
positive
fool
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Jane
,
"
remonstrated
my
mother
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
positive
fool
,
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
else
could
compare
my
brother
's
baby
with
your
boy
?
 
<EOS>
They
are
not
at
all
alike
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
exactly
unlike
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
utterly
dissimilar
in
all
respects
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
they
will
ever
remain
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
sit
here
,
and
hear
such
comparisons
made
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
that
she
stalked
out
,
and
made
the
door
bang
after
her
.
   
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
was
not
a
favourite
with
Miss
Murdstone
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
was
not
a
favourite
there
with
anybody
,
not
even
with
myself
;
for
those
who
did
like
me
could
not
show
it
,
and
those
who
did
not
,
showed
it
so
plainly
that
I
had
a
sensitive
consciousness
of
always
appearing
constrained
,
boorish
,
and
dull
.
   
<EOS>
I
felt
that
I
made
them
as
uncomfortable
as
they
made
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
came
into
the
room
where
they
were
,
and
they
were
talking
together
and
my
mother
seemed
cheerful
,
an
anxious
cloud
would
steal
over
her
face
from
the
moment
of
my
entrance
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mr
Murdstone
were
in
his
best
humour
,
I
checked
him
.
 
<EOS>
If
Miss
Murdstone
were
in
her
worst
,
I
intensified
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
perception
enough
to
know
that
my
mother
was
the
victim
always
;
that
she
was
afraid
to
speak
to
me
or
to
be
kind
to
me
,
lest
she
should
give
them
some
offence
by
her
manner
of
doing
so
,
and
receive
a
lecture
afterwards
;
that
she
was
not
only
ceaselessly
afraid
of
her
own
offending
,
but
of
my
offending
,
and
uneasily
watched
their
looks
if
I
only
moved
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
resolved
to
keep
myself
as
much
out
of
their
way
as
I
could
;
and
many
a
wintry
hour
<EOS>
did
I
hear
the
church
clock
strike
,
when
I
was
sitting
in
my
cheerless
bedroom
,
wrapped
in
my
little
great
-
coat
,
poring
over
a
book
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
evening
,
sometimes
,
I
went
and
sat
with
Peggotty
in
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
There
I
was
comfortable
,
and
not
afraid
of
being
myself
.
<EOS>
But
neither
of
these
resources
was
approved
of
in
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
The
tormenting
humour
which
was
dominant
there
stopped
them
both
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
still
held
to
be
necessary
to
my
poor
mother
's
training
,
and
,
as
one
of
her
trials
,
could
not
be
suffered
to
absent
myself
.
   
<EOS>
"
David
,
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
,
one
day
after
dinner
when
I
was
going
to
leave
the
room
as
usual
;
"
I
am
sorry
to
observe
that
you
are
of
a
sullen
disposition
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
sulky
as
a
bear
!
<EOS>
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
I
stood
still
,
and
hung
my
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
David
,
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
,
"
<EOS>
a
sullen
obdurate
disposition
is
,
of
all
tempers
,
the
worst
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
boy
's
is
,
of
all
such
dispositions
that
ever
I
have
seen
,
"
remarked
his
sister
,
"
the
most
confirmed
and
stubborn
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
my
dear
Clara
,
even
you
must
observe
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
my
dear
Jane
,
"
said
my
mother
,
"
but
are
you
quite
sure
---
<EOS>
I
am
certain
you
'll
excuse
me
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Jane
---
that
you
understand
Davy
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
somewhat
ashamed
of
myself
,
Clara
,
"
returned
Miss
Murdstone
,
"
if
I
could
not
understand
the
boy
,
or
any
boy
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
profess
to
be
profound
;
but
I
do
lay
claim
to
common
sense
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
,
my
dear
Jane
,
"
returned
my
mother
,
"
your
understanding
is
very
vigorous
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
n't
say
that
,
Clara
,
"
interposed
Miss
Murdstone
,
angrily
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
sure
it
is
,
"
resumed
my
mother
;
"
and
everybody
knows
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
profit
so
much
by
it
myself
,
in
many
ways
---
at
least
I
ought
to
---
that
no
one
can
be
more
convinced
of
it
than
myself
;
and
therefore
I
speak
with
great
diffidence
,
my
dear
Jane
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
'll
say
I
do
n't
understand
the
boy
,
Clara
,
"
returned
Miss
Murdstone
,
arranging
the
little
fetters
on
her
wrists
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
'll
agree
,
if
you
please
,
that
I
do
n't
understand
him
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
much
too
deep
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
perhaps
my
brother
's
penetration
may
enable
him
to
have
some
insight
into
his
character
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
believe
my
brother
was
speaking
on
the
subject
when
we
---
not
very
decently
---
interrupted
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Clara
,
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
,
in
a
low
grave
voice
,
"
that
there
may
be
better
and
more
dispassionate
judges
of
such
a
question
than
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Edward
,
"
replied
my
mother
,
timidly
,
"
you
are
a
far
better
judge
of
all
questions
than
I
pretend
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Both
you
and
Jane
are
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
said
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
You
only
said
something
weak
and
inconsiderate
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Try
not
to
do
it
again
,
my
dear
Clara
,
and
keep
a
watch
upon
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
MY
mother
's
lips
moved
,
as
if
she
answered
"
Yes
,
my
dear
Edward
,
"
but
she
said
nothing
aloud
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
sorry
,
David
,
I
remarked
,
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
,
turning
his
head
and
his
eyes
stiffly
towards
me
,
"
to
observe
that
you
are
of
a
sullen
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
not
a
character
that
I
can
suffer
to
develop
itself
beneath
my
eyes
without
an
effort
at
improvement
.
<EOS>
You
must
endeavour
,
sir
,
to
change
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
endeavour
to
change
it
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
I
faltered
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
meant
to
be
sullen
since
I
came
back
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
take
refuge
in
a
lie
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
he
returned
so
fiercely
,
that
I
saw
my
mother
involuntarily
put
out
her
trembling
hand
as
if
to
interpose
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
withdrawn
yourself
in
your
sullenness
to
your
own
room
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
kept
your
own
room
when
you
ought
to
have
been
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
now
,
once
for
all
,
that
I
require
you
to
be
here
,
and
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
Further
,
that
I
require
you
to
bring
obedience
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
me
,
David
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
have
it
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
gave
a
hoarse
chuckle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
a
respectful
,
prompt
,
and
ready
bearing
towards
myself
,
"
he
continued
,
"
and
towards
Jane
Murdstone
,
and
towards
your
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
have
this
room
shunned
as
if
it
were
infected
,
at
the
pleasure
of
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
Sit
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
ordered
me
like
a
dog
,
and
I
obeyed
like
a
dog
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
thing
more
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
observe
that
you
have
an
attachment
to
low
and
common
company
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
not
to
associate
with
servants
.
<EOS>
The
kitchen
will
not
improve
you
,
in
the
many
respects
in
which
you
need
improvement
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
woman
who
abets
you
,
I
say
nothing
---
since
you
,
Clara
,
"
addressing
my
mother
in
a
lower
voice
,
"
from
old
associations
and
long
-
established
fancies
,
have
a
weakness
respecting
her
which
is
not
yet
overcome
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
most
unaccountable
delusion
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miss
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
only
say
,
"
he
resumed
,
addressing
me
,
"
that
I
disapprove
of
your
preferring
such
company
as
Mistress
Peggotty
,
and
that
it
is
to
be
abandoned
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
David
,
you
understand
me
,
and
you
know
what
will
be
the
consequence
if
you
fail
to
obey
me
to
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
knew
well
---
better
perhaps
than
he
thought
,
as
far
as
my
poor
mother
was
concerned
---
<EOS>
and
I
obeyed
him
to
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
retreated
to
my
own
room
no
more
;
I
took
refuge
with
Peggotty
no
more
;
but
sat
wearily
in
the
parlour
day
after
day
,
looking
forward
to
night
,
and
bedtime
.
   
<EOS>
What
irksome
constraint
I
underwent
,
sitting
in
the
same
attitude
hours
upon
hours
,
afraid
to
move
an
arm
or
a
leg
lest
Miss
Murdstone
should
complain
(
as
she
did
on
the
least
pretence
)
of
my
restlessness
,
and
afraid
to
move
an
eye
lest
she
should
light
on
some
look
of
dislike
or
scrutiny
that
would
find
new
cause
for
complaint
in
mine
!
 
<EOS>
What
intolerable
dulness
to
sit
listening
to
the
ticking
of
the
clock
;
and
watching
Miss
Murdstone
's
little
shiny
steel
beads
as
she
strung
them
;
and
wondering
whether
she
would
ever
be
married
,
and
if
so
,
to
what
sort
of
unhappy
man
;
and
counting
the
divisions
in
the
moulding
of
the
chimney
-
piece
;
and
wandering
away
,
with
my
eyes
,
to
the
ceiling
,
among
the
curls
and
corkscrews
in
the
paper
on
the
wall
!
   
<EOS>
What
walks
I
took
alone
,
down
muddy
lanes
,
in
the
bad
winter
weather
,
carrying
that
parlour
,
and
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
in
it
,
everywhere
:
a
monstrous
load
that
I
was
obliged
to
bear
,
a
daymare
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
breaking
in
,
a
weight
that
brooded
on
my
wits
,
and
blunted
them
!
   
<EOS>
What
meals
I
had
in
silence
and
embarrassment
,
always
feeling
that
there
were
a
knife
and
fork
too
many
,
and
that
mine
;
an
appetite
too
many
,
and
that
mine
;
a
plate
and
chair
too
many
,
and
those
mine
;
a
somebody
too
many
,
and
that
<EOS>
I
!
   
<EOS>
What
evenings
,
when
the
candles
came
,
and
I
was
expected
to
employ
myself
,
but
,
not
daring
to
read
an
entertaining
book
,
pored
over
some
hard
-
headed
,
harder
-
hearted
treatise
on
arithmetic
;
when
the
tables
of
weights
and
measures
set
themselves
to
tunes
,
as
"
Rule
Britannia
"
,
or
"
Away
with
Melancholy
"
;
when
they
would
n't
stand
still
to
be
learnt
,
but
would
go
threading
my
grandmother
's
needle
through
my
unfortunate
head
,
in
at
one
ear
and
out
at
the
other
!
<EOS>
What
yawns
and
dozes
I
lapsed
into
,
in
spite
of
all
my
care
;
what
starts
I
came
out
of
concealed
sleeps
with
;
what
answers
I
never
got
,
to
little
observations
that
I
rarely
made
;
what
a
blank
space
I
seemed
,
which
everybody
overlooked
,
and
yet
was
in
everybody
's
way
;
what
a
heavy
relief
it
was
to
hear
Miss
Murdstone
hail
the
first
stroke
of
nine
at
night
,
and
order
me
to
bed
!
   
<EOS>
Thus
the
holidays
lagged
away
,
until
the
morning
came
when
Miss
Murdstone
said
:
"
Here
's
the
last
day
off
!
"
and
gave
me
the
closing
cup
of
tea
of
the
vacation
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
not
sorry
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
lapsed
into
a
stupid
state
;
but
I
was
recovering
a
little
and
looking
forward
to
Steerforth
,
albeit
Mr
Creakle
loomed
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
Again
Mr
Barkis
appeared
at
the
gate
,
and
again
Miss
Murdstone
in
her
warning
voice
,
said
:
"
Clara
!
"
<EOS>
when
my
mother
bent
over
me
,
to
bid
me
farewell
.
   
<EOS>
I
kissed
her
,
and
my
baby
brother
,
and
was
very
sorry
then
;
but
not
sorry
to
go
away
,
for
the
gulf
between
us
was
there
,
and
the
parting
was
there
,
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
is
not
so
much
the
embrace
she
gave
me
,
that
lives
in
my
mind
,
though
it
was
as
fervent
as
could
be
,
as
what
followed
the
embrace
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
in
the
carrier
's
cart
when
I
heard
her
calling
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
looked
out
,
and
she
stood
at
the
garden
-
gate
alone
,
holding
her
baby
up
in
her
arms
for
me
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
cold
still
weather
;
and
not
a
hair
of
her
head
,
nor
a
fold
of
her
dress
,
was
stirred
,
as
she
looked
intently
at
me
,
holding
up
her
child
.
   
<EOS>
So
I
lost
her
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
saw
her
afterwards
,
in
my
sleep
at
school
---
<EOS>
a
silent
presence
near
my
bed
---
looking
at
me
with
the
same
intent
face
---
holding
up
her
baby
in
her
arms
.

Chapter
9
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
memorable
birthday
 
<EOS>
I
PASS
over
all
that
happened
at
school
,
until
the
anniversary
of
my
birthday
came
round
in
March
.
 
<EOS>
Except
that
Steerforth
was
more
to
be
admired
than
ever
,
I
remember
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
going
away
at
the
end
of
the
half
-
year
,
if
not
sooner
,
and
was
more
spirited
and
independent
than
before
in
my
eyes
,
and
therefore
more
engaging
than
before
;
but
beyond
this
I
remember
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
remembrance
by
which
that
time
is
marked
in
my
mind
,
seems
to
have
swallowed
up
all
lesser
recollections
,
and
to
exist
alone
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
even
difficult
for
me
to
believe
that
there
was
a
gap
of
full
two
months
between
my
return
to
Salem
House
and
the
arrival
of
that
birthday
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
only
understand
that
the
fact
was
so
,
because
I
know
it
must
have
been
so
;
otherwise
I
should
feel
convinced
that
there
was
no
interval
,
and
that
the
one
occasion
trod
upon
the
other
's
heels
.
   
<EOS>
How
well
I
recollect
the
kind
of
day
it
was
!
 
<EOS>
I
smell
the
fog
that
hung
about
the
place
;
I
see
the
hoar
frost
,
ghostly
,
through
it
;
I
feel
my
rimy
hair
fall
clammy
on
my
cheek
;
I
look
along
the
dim
perspective
of
the
schoolroom
,
with
a
sputtering
candle
here
and
there
to
light
up
the
foggy
morning
,
and
the
breath
of
the
boys
wreathing
and
smoking
in
the
raw
cold
as
they
blow
upon
their
fingers
,
and
tap
their
feet
upon
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
after
breakfast
,
and
we
had
been
summoned
in
from
the
playground
,
when
Mr
Sharp
entered
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
David
Copperfield
is
to
go
into
the
parlour
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
expected
a
hamper
from
Peggotty
,
and
brightened
at
the
order
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
boys
about
me
put
in
their
claim
not
to
be
forgotten
in
the
distribution
of
the
good
things
,
as
I
got
out
of
my
seat
with
great
alacrity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
hurry
,
David
,
"
said
Mr
Sharp
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
time
enough
,
my
boy
,
do
n't
hurry
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
might
have
been
surprised
by
the
feeling
tone
in
which
he
spoke
,
if
I
had
given
it
a
thought
;
but
I
gave
it
none
until
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
hurried
away
to
the
parlour
;
and
there
I
found
Mr
Creakle
,
sitting
at
his
breakfast
with
the
cane
and
a
newspaper
before
him
,
and
Mrs
Creakle
with
an
opened
letter
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
hamper
.
   
<EOS>
"
David
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mrs
Creakle
,
leading
me
to
a
sofa
,
and
sitting
down
beside
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
very
particularly
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
to
tell
you
,
my
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Creakle
,
at
whom
of
course
I
looked
,
shook
his
head
without
looking
at
me
,
and
stopped
up
a
sigh
with
a
very
large
piece
of
buttered
toast
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
too
young
to
know
how
the
world
changes
every
day
,
"
said
Mrs
Creakle
,
"
and
how
the
people
in
it
pass
away
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
all
have
to
learn
it
,
David
;
some
of
us
when
we
are
young
,
some
of
us
when
we
are
old
,
some
of
us
at
all
times
of
our
lives
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
looked
at
her
earnestly
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
you
came
away
from
home
at
the
end
of
the
vacation
,
"
said
Mrs
Creakle
,
after
a
pause
,
"
were
they
all
well
?
"
 
<EOS>
After
another
pause
,
"
Was
your
mama
well
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
trembled
without
distinctly
knowing
why
,
and
still
looked
at
her
earnestly
,
making
no
attempt
to
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Because
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
grieve
to
tell
you
that
I
hear
this
morning
your
mama
is
very
ill
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
mist
rose
between
Mrs
Creakle
and
me
,
and
her
figure
seemed
to
move
in
it
for
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
felt
the
burning
tears
run
down
my
face
,
and
it
was
steady
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
very
dangerously
ill
,
"
she
added
.
   
<EOS>
I
knew
all
now
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
dead
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
need
to
tell
me
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
already
broken
out
into
a
desolate
cry
,
and
felt
an
orphan
in
the
wide
world
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
very
kind
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
kept
me
there
all
day
,
and
left
me
alone
sometimes
;
and
I
cried
,
and
wore
myself
to
sleep
,
and
awoke
and
cried
again
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
could
cry
no
more
,
I
began
to
think
;
and
then
the
oppression
on
my
breast
was
heaviest
,
and
my
grief
a
dull
pain
that
there
was
no
ease
for
.
   
<EOS>
And
yet
my
thoughts
were
idle
;
not
intent
on
the
calamity
that
weighed
upon
my
heart
,
but
idly
loitering
near
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
of
our
house
shut
up
and
hushed
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
of
the
little
baby
,
who
,
Mrs
Creakle
said
,
had
been
pining
away
for
some
time
,
and
who
,
they
believed
,
would
die
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
of
my
father
's
grave
in
the
churchyard
,
by
our
house
,
and
of
my
mother
lying
there
beneath
the
tree
I
knew
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
stood
upon
a
chair
when
I
was
left
alone
,
and
looked
into
the
glass
to
see
how
red
my
eyes
were
,
and
how
sorrowful
my
face
.
 
<EOS>
I
considered
,
after
some
hours
were
gone
,
<EOS>
if
my
tears
were
really
hard
to
flow
now
,
as
they
seemed
to
be
,
what
,
in
connexion
with
my
loss
,
it
would
affect
me
most
to
think
of
when
I
drew
near
home
---
for
I
was
going
home
to
the
funeral
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sensible
of
having
felt
that
a
dignity
attached
to
me
among
the
rest
of
the
boys
,
and
that
I
was
important
in
my
affliction
.
   
<EOS>
If
ever
child
were
stricken
with
sincere
grief
,
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
remember
that
this
importance
was
a
kind
of
satisfaction
to
me
,
when
I
walked
in
the
playground
that
afternoon
while
the
boys
were
in
school
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
saw
them
glancing
at
me
out
of
the
windows
,
as
they
went
up
to
their
classes
,
I
felt
distinguished
,
and
looked
more
melancholy
,
and
walked
slower
.
 
<EOS>
When
school
was
over
,
and
they
came
out
and
spoke
to
me
,
I
felt
it
rather
good
in
myself
not
to
be
proud
to
any
of
them
,
and
to
take
exactly
the
same
notice
of
them
all
,
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
to
go
home
next
night
;
not
by
the
mail
,
but
by
the
heavy
night
-
coach
,
which
was
called
the
Farmer
,
and
was
principally
used
by
country
-
people
travelling
short
intermediate
distances
upon
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
no
story
<EOS>
-
telling
that
evening
,
and
Traddles
insisted
on
lending
me
his
pillow
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
<EOS>
what
good
he
thought
it
would
do
me
,
for
I
had
one
of
my
own
:
<EOS>
but
it
was
all
he
had
to
lend
,
poor
fellow
,
except
a
sheet
of
letter
-
paper
full
of
skeletons
;
and
that
he
gave
me
at
parting
,
as
a
soother
of
my
sorrows
and
a
contribution
to
my
peace
of
mind
.
   
<EOS>
I
left
Salem
House
upon
the
morrow
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
I
little
thought
then
that
I
left
it
,
never
to
return
.
 
<EOS>
We
travelled
very
slowly
all
night
,
and
did
not
get
into
Yarmouth
before
nine
or
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
looked
out
for
Mr
Barkis
,
but
he
was
not
there
;
and
instead
of
him
a
fat
,
short
-
winded
,
merry
-
looking
,
little
old
man
in
black
,
with
rusty
little
bunches
of
ribbons
at
the
knees
of
his
breeches
,
black
stockings
,
and
a
broad
-
brimmed
hat
,
came
puffing
up
to
the
coach
window
,
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Master
Copperfield
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
come
with
me
,
young
sir
,
if
you
please
,
"
he
said
,
opening
the
door
,
"
and
I
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
taking
you
home
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
put
my
hand
in
his
,
wondering
who
he
was
,
and
we
walked
away
to
a
shop
in
a
narrow
street
,
on
which
was
written
OMER
,
DRAPER
,
TAILOR
,
HABERDASHER
,
FUNERAL
FURNISHER
,
&
c.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
close
and
stifling
little
shop
;
full
of
all
sorts
of
clothing
,
made
and
unmade
,
including
one
window
full
of
beaver
-
hats
and
bonnets
.
 
<EOS>
We
went
into
a
little
back
-
parlour
behind
the
shop
,
where
we
found
three
young
women
at
work
on
a
quantity
of
black
materials
,
which
were
heaped
upon
the
table
,
and
little
bits
and
cuttings
of
which
were
littered
all
over
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
good
fire
in
the
room
,
and
a
breathless
smell
of
warm
black
crape
---
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
what
the
smell
was
then
,
but
I
know
now
.
   
<EOS>
The
three
young
women
,
who
appeared
to
be
very
industrious
and
comfortable
,
raised
their
heads
to
look
at
me
,
and
then
went
on
with
their
work
.
 
<EOS>
Stitch
,
stitch
,
stitch
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
there
came
from
a
workshop
across
a
little
yard
outside
the
window
,
a
regular
sound
of
hammering
that
kept
a
kind
of
tune
:
RAT
---
tat
-
tat
,
RAT
---
tat
-
tat
,
RAT
---
tat
-
tat
,
without
any
variation
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
my
conductor
to
one
of
the
three
young
women
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
get
on
,
Minnie
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
ready
by
the
trying
-
on
time
,
"
she
replied
gaily
,
without
looking
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
be
afraid
,
father
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Omer
took
off
his
broad
-
brimmed
hat
,
and
sat
down
and
panted
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
fat
that
he
was
obliged
to
pant
some
time
before
he
could
say
:
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Father
!
<EOS>
"
said
Minnie
,
playfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
porpoise
you
do
grow
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
,
my
dear
,
"
he
replied
,
considering
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
rather
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
such
a
comfortable
man
,
you
see
,
"
said
Minnie
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
take
things
so
easy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
use
taking
'em
otherwise
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
"
returned
his
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
all
pretty
gay
here
,
thank
Heaven
!
 
<EOS>
Ai
n't
we
,
father
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
I
have
got
my
breath
now
,
I
think
I
'll
measure
this
young
scholar
.
 
<EOS>
Would
you
walk
into
the
shop
,
Master
Copperfield
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
preceded
Mr
Omer
,
in
compliance
with
his
request
;
and
after
showing
me
a
roll
of
cloth
which
he
said
was
extra
super
,
and
too
good
mourning
for
anything
short
of
parents
,
he
took
my
various
dimensions
,
and
put
them
down
in
a
book
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
recording
them
he
called
my
attention
to
his
stock
in
trade
,
and
to
certain
fashions
which
he
said
had
"
just
come
up
"
,
and
to
certain
other
fashions
which
he
said
had
"
just
gone
out
"
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
by
that
sort
of
thing
we
very
often
lose
a
little
mint
of
money
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
fashions
are
like
human
beings
.
 
<EOS>
They
come
in
,
nobody
knows
when
,
why
,
or
how
;
and
they
go
out
,
nobody
knows
when
,
why
,
or
how
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
is
like
life
,
in
my
opinion
,
if
you
look
at
it
in
that
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
too
sorrowful
to
discuss
the
question
,
which
would
possibly
have
been
beyond
me
under
any
circumstances
;
and
Mr
Omer
took
me
back
into
the
parlour
,
breathing
with
some
difficulty
on
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
He
then
called
down
a
little
break
-
neck
range
of
steps
behind
a
door
:
"
Bring
up
that
tea
and
bread
-
and
-
butter
!
"
<EOS>
which
,
after
some
time
,
during
which
I
sat
looking
about
me
and
thinking
,
and
listening
to
the
stitching
in
the
room
and
the
tune
that
was
being
hammered
across
the
yard
,
appeared
on
a
tray
,
and
turned
out
to
be
for
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
acquainted
with
you
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
after
watching
me
for
some
minutes
,
during
which
I
had
not
made
much
impression
on
the
breakfast
,
for
the
black
things
destroyed
my
appetite
,
"
I
have
been
acquainted
with
you
a
long
time
,
my
young
friend
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Have
you
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
your
life
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
may
say
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
your
father
before
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
five
foot
nine
and
a
half
,
and
he
lays
in
five
-
and
-
twen
-
ty
foot
of
ground
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
RAT

across

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
lays

five
and
twen
-
ty
foot
of
ground
,
if
he
lays
in
a
fraction
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
pleasantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
either
his
request
or
her
direction
,
I
forget
which
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
how
my
little
brother
is
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Omer
shook
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
RAT

"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
in
his
mother
's
arms
,
"
said
he
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
poor
little
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
Is
he
dead
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mind
it
more
than
you
can
help
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
The
baby
's
dead
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
wounds
broke
out
afresh
at
this
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
the
scarcely
-
tasted
breakfast
,
and
went
and
rested
my
head
on
another
table
,
in
a
corner
of
the
little
room
,
which
Minnie
hastily
cleared
,
lest
I
should
spot
the
mourning
that
was
lying
there
with
my
tears
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
pretty
,
good
-
natured
girl
,
and
put
my
hair
away
from
my
eyes
with
a
soft
,
kind
touch
;
but
she
was
very
cheerful
at
having
nearly
finished
her
work
and
being
in
good
time
,
and
was
so
different
from
me
!
   
<EOS>
Presently
the
tune
left
off
,
and
a
good
-
looking
young
fellow
came
across
the
yard
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
hammer
in
his
hand
,
and
his
mouth
was
full
of
little
nails
,
which
he
was
obliged
to
take
out
before
he
could
speak
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Joram
!
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
get
on
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
"
said
Joram
.
 
<EOS>
"
Done
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Minnie
coloured
a
little
,
and
the
other
two
girls
smiled
at
one
another
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
you
were
at
it
by
candle
-
light
last
night
,
when
I
was
at
the
club
,
then
?
 
<EOS>
Were
you
?
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
shutting
up
one
eye
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Joram
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
you
said
we
could
make
a
little
trip
of
it
,
and
go
over
together
,
if
it
was
done
,
Minnie
and
me
---
and
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
were
going
to
leave
me
out
altogether
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
laughing
till
he
coughed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
---
As
you
was
so
good
as
to
say
that
,
"
resumed
the
young
man
,
"
why
I
turned
to
with
a
will
,
you
see
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
give
me
your
opinion
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
rising
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
"
;
and
he
stopped
and
turned
to
me
:
"
would
you
like
to
see
your
---
"
   
"
No
,
father
,
"
Minnie
interposed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
might
be
agreeable
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
perhaps
you
're
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
how
I
knew
it
was
my
dear
,
dear
mother
's
coffin
that
they
went
to
look
at
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
never
heard
one
making
;
I
had
never
seen
one
that
I
know
of
:
but
it
came
into
my
mind
what
the
noise
was
,
while
it
was
going
on
;
and
when
the
young
man
entered
,
I
am
sure
I
knew
what
he
had
been
doing
.
   
<EOS>
The
work
being
now
finished
,
the
two
girls
,
whose
names
I
had
not
heard
,
brushed
the
shreds
and
threads
from
their
dresses
,
and
went
into
the
shop
to
put
that
to
rights
,
and
wait
for
customers
.
<EOS>
Minnie
stayed
behind
to
fold
up
what
they
had
made
,
and
pack
it
in
two
baskets
.
 
<EOS>
This
she
did
upon
her
knees
,
humming
a
lively
little
tune
the
while
.
 
<EOS>
Joram
,
who
I
had
no
doubt
was
her
lover
,
came
in
and
stole
a
kiss
from
her
while
she
was
busy
(
he
did
n't
appear
to
mind
me
,
at
all
)
,
and
said
her
father
was
gone
for
the
chaise
,
and
he
must
make
haste
and
get
himself
ready
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
went
out
again
;
and
then
she
put
her
thimble
and
scissors
in
her
pocket
,
and
stuck
a
needle
threaded
with
black
thread
neatly
in
the
bosom
of
her
gown
,
and
put
on
her
outer
clothing
smartly
,
at
a
little
glass
behind
the
door
,
in
which
I
saw
the
reflection
of
her
pleased
face
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
I
observed
,
sitting
at
the
table
in
the
corner
with
my
head
leaning
on
my
hand
,
and
my
thoughts
running
on
very
different
things
.
 
<EOS>
The
chaise
soon
came
round
to
the
front
of
the
shop
,
and
the
baskets
being
put
in
first
,
I
was
put
in
next
,
and
those
three
followed
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
it
as
a
kind
of
half
chaise
-
cart
,
half
pianoforte
-
van
,
painted
of
a
sombre
colour
,
and
drawn
by
a
black
horse
with
a
long
tail
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
plenty
of
room
for
us
all
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
have
ever
experienced
so
strange
a
feeling
in
my
life
<EOS>
(
I
am
wiser
now
,
perhaps
)
as
that
of
being
with
them
,
remembering
how
they
had
been
employed
,
and
seeing
them
enjoy
the
ride
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
angry
with
them
;
I
was
more
afraid
of
them
,
as
if
I
were
cast
away
among
creatures
with
whom
I
had
no
community
of
nature
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
very
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
sat
in
front
to
drive
,
and
the
two
young
people
sat
behind
him
,
and
whenever
he
spoke
to
them
leaned
forward
,
the
one
on
one
side
of
his
chubby
face
and
the
other
on
the
other
,
and
made
a
great
deal
of
him
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
talked
to
me
too
,
but
I
held
back
,
and
moped
in
my
corner
;
scared
by
their
love
-
making
and
hilarity
,
though
it
was
far
from
boisterous
,
and
almost
wondering
that
no
judgement
came
upon
them
for
their
hardness
of
heart
.
   
<EOS>
So
,
when
they
stopped
to
bait
the
horse
,
and
ate
and
drank
and
enjoyed
themselves
,
I
could
touch
nothing
that
they
touched
,
but
kept
my
fast
unbroken
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
when
we
reached
home
,
I
dropped
out
of
the
chaise
behind
,
as
quickly
as
possible
,
that
I
might
not
be
in
their
company
before
those
solemn
windows
,
looking
blindly
on
me
like
closed
eyes
once
bright
.
 
<EOS>
And
oh
,
how
little
need
I
had
had
to
think
what
would
move
me
to
tears
when
I
came
back
---
seeing
the
window
of
my
mother
's
room
,
and
next
it
that
which
,
in
the
better
time
,
was
mine
!
   
<EOS>
I
was
in
Peggotty
's
arms
before
I
got
to
the
door
,
and
she
took
me
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Her
grief
burst
out
when
she
first
saw
me
;
but
she
controlled
it
soon
,
and
spoke
in
whispers
,
and
walked
softly
,
as
if
the
dead
could
be
disturbed
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
not
been
in
bed
,
I
found
,
for
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
up
at
night
still
,
and
watched
.
 
<EOS>
As
long
as
her
poor
dear
pretty
was
above
the
ground
,
she
said
,
she
would
never
desert
her
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Murdstone
took
no
heed
of
me
when
I
went
into
the
parlour
where
he
was
,
but
sat
by
the
fireside
,
weeping
silently
,
and
pondering
in
his
elbow
-
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
,
who
was
busy
at
her
writing
-
desk
,
which
was
covered
with
letters
and
papers
,
gave
me
her
cold
finger
-
nails
,
and
asked
me
,
in
an
iron
whisper
,
if
I
had
been
measured
for
my
mourning
.
   
<EOS>
I
said
:
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
your
shirts
,
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
;
"
have
you
brought
'em
home
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
brought
home
all
my
clothes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
all
the
consolation
that
her
firmness
administered
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
doubt
that
she
had
a
choice
pleasure
in
exhibiting
what
she
called
her
self
-
command
,
and
her
firmness
,
and
her
strength
of
mind
,
and
her
common
sense
,
and
the
whole
diabolical
catalogue
of
her
unamiable
qualities
,
on
such
an
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
particularly
proud
of
her
turn
for
business
;
and
she
showed
it
now
in
reducing
everything
to
pen
and
ink
,
and
being
moved
by
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
rest
of
that
day
,
and
from
morning
to
night
afterwards
<EOS>
,
she
sat
at
that
desk
,
scratching
composedly
with
a
hard
pen
,
speaking
in
the
same
imperturbable
whisper
to
everybody
;
never
relaxing
a
muscle
of
her
face
,
or
softening
a
tone
of
her
voice
,
or
appearing
with
an
atom
of
her
dress
astray
.
   
<EOS>
Her
brother
took
a
book
sometimes
,
but
never
read
it
that
I
saw
.
<EOS>
He
would
open
it
and
look
at
it
as
if
he
were
reading
,
but
would
remain
for
a
whole
hour
without
turning
the
leaf
,
and
then
put
it
down
and
walk
to
and
fro
in
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
used
to
sit
with
folded
hands
watching
him
,
and
counting
his
footsteps
,
hour
after
hour
.
<EOS>
He
very
seldom
spoke
to
her
,
and
never
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
the
only
restless
thing
,
except
the
clocks
,
in
the
whole
motionless
house
.
   
<EOS>
In
these
days
before
the
funeral
,
I
saw
but
little
of
Peggotty
,
except
that
,
in
passing
up
or
down
stairs
,
I
always
found
her
close
to
the
room
where
my
mother
and
her
baby
lay
,
and
except
that
she
came
to
me
every
night
,
and
sat
by
my
bed
's
head
while
I
went
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
A
day
or
two
before
the
burial
---
I
think
it
was
a
day
or
two
before
,
but
I
am
conscious
of
confusion
in
my
mind
about
that
heavy
time
,
with
nothing
to
mark
its
progress
---
she
took
me
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
recollect
that
underneath
some
white
covering
on
the
bed
,
with
a
beautiful
cleanliness
and
freshness
all
around
it
,
there
seemed
to
me
to
lie
embodied
the
solemn
stillness
that
was
in
the
house
;
and
that
when
she
would
have
turned
the
cover
gently
back
,
I
cried
:
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
!
 
<EOS>
oh
no
!
"
and
held
her
hand
.
   
<EOS>
If
the
funeral
had
been
yesterday
,
I
could
not
recollect
it
better
.
<EOS>
The
very
air
of
the
best
parlour
,
when
I
went
in
at
the
door
,
the
bright
condition
of
the
fire
,
the
shining
of
the
wine
in
the
decanters
,
the
patterns
of
the
glasses
and
plates
,
the
faint
sweet
smell
of
cake
,
the
odour
of
Miss
Murdstone
's
dress
,
and
our
black
clothes
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chillip
is
in
the
room
,
and
comes
to
speak
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
is
Master
David
?
"
<EOS>
he
says
,
kindly
.
   
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
him
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
him
my
hand
,
which
he
holds
in
his
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
says
Mr
Chillip
,
meekly
smiling
,
with
something
shining
in
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
Our
little
friends
grow
up
around
us
.
 
<EOS>
They
grow
out
of
our
knowledge
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
This
is
to
Miss
Murdstone
,
who
makes
no
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
great
improvement
here
,
ma'am
?
"
says
Mr
Chillip
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
merely
answers
with
a
frown
and
a
formal
bend
:
<EOS>
Mr
Chillip
,
discomfited
,
goes
into
a
corner
,
keeping
me
with
him
,
and
opens
his
mouth
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
I
remark
this
,
because
I
remark
everything
that
happens
,
not
because
I
care
about
myself
,
or
have
done
since
I
came
home
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
the
bell
begins
to
sound
,
and
Mr
Omer
and
another
come
to
make
us
ready
.
 
<EOS>
As
Peggotty
was
wo
nt
to
tell
me
,
long
ago
,
the
followers
of
my
father
to
the
same
grave
were
made
ready
in
the
same
room
.
   
<EOS>
There
are
Mr
Murdstone
,
our
neighbour
Mr
Grayper
,
Mr
Chillip
,
and
I.
 
<EOS>
When
we
go
out
to
the
door
,
the
Bearers
and
their
load
are
in
the
garden
;
and
they
move
before
us
down
the
path
,
and
past
the
elms
,
and
through
the
gate
,
and
into
the
churchyard
,
where
I
have
so
often
heard
the
birds
sing
on
a
summer
morning
.
   
<EOS>
We
stand
around
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
seems
different
to
me
from
every
other
day
,
and
the
light
not
of
the
same
colour
---
of
a
sadder
colour
.
 
<EOS>
Now
there
is
a
solemn
hush
,
which
we
have
brought
from
home
with
what
is
resting
in
the
mould
;
and
while
we
stand
bareheaded
,
I
hear
the
voice
of
the
clergyman
,
sounding
remote
in
the
open
air
,
and
yet
distinct
and
plain
,
saying
:
"
I
am
the
Resurrection
and
the
Life
,
saith
the
Lord
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
I
hear
sobs
;
and
,
standing
apart
among
the
lookers
-
on
,
I
see
that
good
and
faithful
servant
,
whom
of
all
the
people
upon
earth
<EOS>
I
love
the
best
,
and
unto
whom
my
childish
heart
is
certain
that
the
Lord
will
one
day
say
:
"
Well
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
are
many
faces
that
I
know
,
among
the
little
crowd
;
faces
that
I
knew
in
church
,
when
mine
was
always
wondering
there
;
faces
that
first
saw
my
mother
,
when
she
came
to
the
village
in
her
youthful
bloom
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mind
them
<EOS>
---
I
mind
nothing
but
my
grief
---
<EOS>
and
yet
I
see
and
know
them
all
;
and
even
in
the
background
,
far
away
,
see
Minnie
looking
on
,
and
her
eye
glancing
on
her
sweetheart
,
who
is
near
me
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
over
,
and
the
earth
is
filled
in
,
and
we
turn
to
come
away
.
<EOS>
Before
us
stands
our
house
,
so
pretty
and
unchanged
,
so
linked
in
my
mind
with
the
young
idea
of
what
is
gone
,
that
all
my
sorrow
has
been
nothing
to
the
sorrow
it
calls
forth
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
take
me
on
;
and
Mr
Chillip
talks
to
me
;
and
when
we
get
home
,
puts
some
water
to
my
lips
;
and
when
I
ask
his
leave
to
go
up
to
my
room
,
dismisses
me
with
the
gentleness
of
a
woman
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
,
I
say
,
is
yesterday
's
event
.
 
<EOS>
Events
of
later
date
have
floated
from
me
to
the
shore
where
all
forgotten
things
will
reappear
,
but
this
stands
like
a
high
rock
in
the
ocean
.
   
<EOS>
I
knew
that
Peggotty
would
come
to
me
in
my
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
Sabbath
stillness
of
the
time
<EOS>
(
the
day
was
so
like
Sunday
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
forgotten
that
)
was
suited
to
us
both
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
down
by
my
side
upon
my
little
bed
;
and
holding
my
hand
,
and
sometimes
putting
it
to
her
lips
,
and
sometimes
smoothing
it
with
hers
,
as
she
might
have
comforted
my
little
brother
,
told
me
,
in
her
way
,
all
that
she
had
to
tell
concerning
what
had
happened
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
was
never
well
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
"
for
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
uncertain
in
her
mind
,
and
not
happy
.
 
<EOS>
When
her
baby
was
born
,
I
thought
at
first
she
would
get
better
,
but
she
was
more
delicate
,
and
sunk
a
little
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
She
used
to
like
to
sit
alone
before
her
baby
came
,
and
then
she
cried
;
but
afterwards
she
used
to
sing
to
it
---
<EOS>
so
soft
,
that
I
once
thought
,
when
I
heard
her
,
it
was
like
a
voice
up
in
the
air
,
that
was
rising
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
got
to
be
more
timid
,
and
more
frightened
-
like
,
of
late
;
and
that
a
hard
word
was
like
a
blow
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
was
always
the
same
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
changed
to
her
foolish
Peggotty
,
did
n't
my
sweet
girl
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Peggotty
stopped
,
and
softly
beat
upon
my
hand
a
little
while
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
last
time
that
I
saw
her
like
her
own
old
self
,
was
the
night
when
you
came
home
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
you
went
away
,
she
said
to
me
,
"
I
never
shall
see
my
pretty
darling
again
.
 
<EOS>
Something
tells
me
so
,
that
tells
the
truth
,
I
know
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
She
tried
to
hold
up
after
that
;
and
many
a
time
,
when
they
told
her
she
was
thoughtless
and
light
-
hearted
,
made
believe
to
be
so
;
but
it
was
all
a
bygone
then
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
told
her
husband
what
she
had
told
me
---
she
was
afraid
of
saying
it
to
anybody
else
---
till
one
night
,
a
little
more
than
a
week
before
it
happened
,
when
she
said
to
him
:
"
My
dear
,
I
think
I
am
dying
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
"
It
's
off
my
mind
now
,
Peggotty
,
"
she
told
me
,
when
I
laid
her
in
her
bed
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
will
believe
it
more
and
more
,
poor
fellow
,
every
day
for
a
few
days
to
come
;
and
then
it
will
be
past
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
tired
.
 
<EOS>
If
this
is
sleep
,
sit
by
me
while
I
sleep
:
do
n't
leave
me
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
both
my
children
!
 
<EOS>
God
protect
and
keep
my
fatherless
boy
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
I
never
left
her
afterwards
,
"
said
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
often
talked
to
them
two
downstairs
---
for
she
loved
them
;
she
could
n't
bear
not
to
love
anyone
who
was
about
her
---
but
when
they
went
away
from
her
bed
-
side
,
she
always
turned
to
me
,
as
if
there
was
rest
where
Peggotty
was
,
and
never
fell
asleep
in
any
other
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
the
last
night
,
in
the
evening
,
she
kissed
me
,
and
said
:
"
If
my
baby
should
die
too
,
Peggotty
,
please
let
them
lay
him
in
my
arms
,
and
bury
us
together
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
It
was
done
;
for
the
poor
lamb
lived
but
a
day
beyond
her
.
)
<EOS>
"
Let
my
dearest
boy
go
with
us
to
our
resting
-
place
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
tell
him
that
his
mother
,
when
she
lay
here
,
blessed
him
not
once
,
but
a
thousand
times
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
Another
silence
followed
this
,
and
another
gentle
beating
on
my
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
pretty
far
in
the
night
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
"
when
she
asked
me
for
some
drink
;
and
when
she
had
taken
it
,
gave
me
such
a
patient
smile
,
the
dear
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
so
beautiful
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Daybreak
had
come
,
and
the
sun
was
rising
,
when
she
said
to
me
,
how
kind
and
considerate
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
had
always
been
to
her
,
and
how
he
had
borne
with
her
,
and
told
her
,
when
she
doubted
herself
,
that
a
loving
heart
was
better
and
stronger
than
wisdom
,
and
that
he
was
a
happy
man
in
hers
.
 
<EOS>
"
Peggotty
,
my
dear
,
"
she
said
then
,
"
put
me
nearer
to
you
,
"
for
she
was
very
weak
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lay
your
good
arm
underneath
my
neck
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
turn
me
to
you
,
for
your
face
is
going
far
off
,
and
I
want
it
to
be
near
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
put
it
as
she
asked
;
and
oh
Davy
!
<EOS>
the
time
had
come
when
my
first
parting
words
to
you
were
true
---
when
she
was
glad
to
lay
her
poor
head
on
her
stupid
cross
old
Peggotty
's
arm
---
and
she
died
like
a
child
that
had
gone
to
sleep
!
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
ended
Peggotty
's
narration
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
moment
of
my
knowing
of
the
death
of
my
mother
,
the
idea
of
her
as
she
had
been
of
late
had
vanished
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
remembered
her
,
from
that
instant
,
only
as
the
young
mother
of
my
earliest
impressions
,
who
had
been
used
to
wind
her
bright
curls
round
and
round
her
finger
,
and
to
dance
with
me
at
twilight
in
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
What
Peggotty
had
told
me
now
,
was
so
far
from
bringing
me
back
to
the
later
period
,
that
it
rooted
the
earlier
image
in
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
curious
,
but
it
is
true
.
 
<EOS>
In
her
death
she
winged
her
way
back
to
her
calm
untroubled
youth
,
and
cancelled
all
the
rest
.
   
<EOS>
The
mother
who
lay
in
the
grave
,
was
the
mother
of
my
infancy
;
the
little
creature
in
her
arms
,
was
myself
,
as
I
had
once
been
,
hushed
for
ever
on
her
bosom
.
      
<EOS>
Chapter
10
.
<EOS>
I
become
neglected
,
and
am
provided
for
 
The
first
act
of
business
Miss
Murdstone
performed
when
the
day
of
the
solemnity
was
over
,
and
light
was
freely
admitted
into
the
house
,
was
to
give
Peggotty
a
month
's
warning
.
 
<EOS>
Much
as
Peggotty
would
have
disliked
such
a
service
,
I
believe
she
would
have
retained
it
,
for
my
sake
,
in
preference
to
the
best
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
She
told
me
we
must
part
,
and
told
me
why
;
and
we
condoled
with
one
another
,
in
all
sincerity
.
   
<EOS>
As
to
me
or
my
future
,
not
a
word
was
said
,
or
a
step
taken
.
 
<EOS>
Happy
<EOS>
they
would
have
been
,
I
dare
say
,
if
they
could
have
dismissed
me
at
a
month
's
warning
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
mustered
courage
once
,
to
ask
Miss
Murdstone
when
I
was
going
back
to
school
;
and
she
answered
dryly
,
she
believed
I
was
not
going
back
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
told
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
I
was
very
anxious
to
know
what
was
going
to
be
done
with
me
,
and
so
was
Peggotty
;
but
neither
she
nor
I
could
pick
up
any
information
on
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
one
change
in
my
condition
,
which
,
while
it
relieved
me
of
a
great
deal
of
present
uneasiness
,
might
have
made
me
,
if
I
had
been
capable
of
considering
it
closely
,
yet
more
uncomfortable
about
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
this
.
 
<EOS>
The
constraint
that
had
been
put
upon
me
,
was
quite
abandoned
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
far
from
being
required
to
keep
my
dull
post
in
the
parlour
<EOS>
,
that
on
several
occasions
,
when
I
took
my
seat
there
,
Miss
Murdstone
frowned
to
me
to
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
far
from
being
warned
off
from
Peggotty
's
society
,
that
,
provided
I
was
not
in
Mr
Murdstone
's
,
I
was
never
sought
out
or
inquired
for
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
I
was
in
daily
dread
of
his
taking
my
education
in
hand
again
,
or
of
Miss
Murdstone
's
devoting
herself
to
it
;
but
I
soon
began
to
think
that
such
fears
were
groundless
,
and
that
all
I
had
to
anticipate
was
neglect
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
conceive
that
this
discovery
gave
me
much
pain
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
still
giddy
with
the
shock
of
my
mother
's
death
,
and
in
a
kind
of
stunned
state
as
to
all
tributary
things
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
recollect
,
indeed
,
to
have
speculated
,
at
odd
times
,
on
the
possibility
of
my
not
being
taught
any
more
,
or
cared
for
any
more
;
and
growing
up
to
be
a
shabby
,
moody
man
,
lounging
an
idle
life
away
,
about
the
village
;
as
well
as
on
the
feasibility
of
my
getting
rid
of
this
picture
by
going
away
somewhere
,
like
the
hero
in
a
story
,
to
seek
my
fortune
:
but
these
were
transient
visions
,
daydreams
<EOS>
I
sat
looking
at
sometimes
,
as
if
they
were
faintly
painted
or
written
on
the
wall
of
my
room
,
and
which
,
as
they
melted
away
,
left
the
wall
blank
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Peggotty
,
"
I
said
in
a
thoughtful
whisper
,
one
evening
,
when
I
was
warming
my
hands
at
the
kitchen
fire
,
"
<EOS>
Mr
Murdstone
likes
me
less
than
he
used
to
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
liked
me
much
,
Peggotty
;
but
he
would
rather
not
even
see
me
now
,
if
he
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
's
his
sorrow
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
stroking
my
hair
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
Peggotty
,
I
am
sorry
too
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
believed
it
was
his
sorrow
,
I
should
not
think
of
it
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
not
that
;
<EOS>
oh
,
no
,
it
's
not
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
it
's
not
that
?
"
said
Peggotty
,
after
a
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
his
sorrow
is
another
and
quite
a
different
thing
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
sorry
at
this
moment
,
sitting
by
the
fireside
with
Miss
Murdstone
;
but
if
I
was
to
go
in
,
Peggotty
,
he
would
be
something
besides
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
would
he
be
?
"
said
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
Angry
,
"
I
answered
,
with
an
involuntary
imitation
of
his
dark
frown
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
he
was
only
sorry
,
he
would
n't
look
at
me
as
he
does
.
<EOS>
I
am
only
sorry
,
and
it
makes
me
feel
kinder
.
"
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
said
nothing
for
a
little
while
;
and
I
warmed
my
hands
,
as
silent
as
she
.
   
<EOS>
"
Davy
,
"
she
said
at
length
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
tried
,
my
dear
,
all
ways
I
could
think
of
---
all
the
ways
there
are
,
and
all
the
ways
there
ai
n't
,
in
short
---
to
get
a
suitable
service
here
,
in
Blunderstone
;
but
there
's
no
such
a
thing
,
my
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
mean
to
do
,
Peggotty
,
"
says
I
,
wistfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
go
and
seek
your
fortune
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
expect
I
shall
be
forced
to
go
to
Yarmouth
,
"
replied
Peggotty
,
"
and
live
there
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
might
have
gone
farther
off
,
"
I
said
,
brightening
a
little
,
"
and
been
as
bad
as
lost
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
see
you
sometimes
,
<EOS>
my
dear
old
Peggotty
,
there
.
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
be
quite
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
,
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Contrary
ways
,
please
God
!
"
cried
Peggotty
,
with
great
animation
.
<EOS>
"
As
long
as
you
are
here
,
my
pet
,
I
shall
come
over
every
week
of
my
life
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
One
day
,
every
week
of
my
life
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
felt
a
great
weight
taken
off
my
mind
by
this
promise
:
but
even
this
was
not
all
,
for
Peggotty
went
on
to
say
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
-
going
,
Davy
,
you
see
,
to
my
brother
's
,
first
,
for
another
fortnight
's
visit
---
just
till
I
have
had
time
to
look
about
me
,
and
get
to
be
something
like
myself
again
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
have
been
thinking
that
perhaps
,
as
they
do
n't
want
you
here
at
present
,
you
might
be
let
to
go
along
with
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
If
anything
,
short
of
being
in
a
different
relation
to
every
one
about
me
,
Peggotty
excepted
,
could
have
given
me
a
sense
of
pleasure
at
that
time
,
it
would
have
been
this
project
of
all
others
.
 
<EOS>
The
idea
of
being
again
surrounded
by
those
honest
faces
,
shining
welcome
on
me
;
of
renewing
the
peacefulness
of
the
sweet
Sunday
morning
,
when
the
bells
were
ringing
,
the
stones
dropping
in
the
water
,
and
the
shadowy
ships
breaking
through
the
mist
;
of
roaming
up
and
down
with
little
Em'ly
,
telling
her
my
troubles
,
and
finding
charms
against
them
in
the
shells
and
pebbles
on
the
beach
;
made
a
calm
in
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
ruffled
next
moment
,
to
be
sure
,
by
a
doubt
of
Miss
Murdstone
's
giving
her
consent
;
but
even
that
was
set
at
rest
soon
,
for
she
came
out
to
take
an
evening
grope
in
the
store
-
closet
while
we
were
yet
in
conversation
,
and
Peggotty
,
with
a
boldness
that
amazed
me
,
broached
the
topic
on
the
spot
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
boy
will
be
idle
there
,
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
looking
into
a
pickle
-
jar
,
"
and
idleness
is
the
root
of
all
evil
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
to
be
sure
,
he
would
be
idle
here
---
or
anywhere
,
in
my
opinion
.
"
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
had
an
angry
answer
ready
,
I
could
see
;
but
she
swallowed
it
for
my
sake
,
and
remained
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
<EOS>
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
still
keeping
her
eye
on
the
pickles
;
"
it
is
of
more
importance
than
anything
else
---
it
is
of
paramount
importance
---
that
my
brother
should
not
be
disturbed
or
made
uncomfortable
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
had
better
say
yes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
thanked
her
,
without
making
any
demonstration
of
joy
,
lest
it
should
induce
her
to
withdraw
her
assent
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
could
I
help
thinking
this
a
prudent
course
,
since
she
looked
at
me
out
of
the
pickle
-
jar
,
with
as
great
an
access
of
sourness
as
if
her
black
eyes
had
absorbed
its
contents
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
the
permission
was
given
,
and
was
never
retracted
;
for
when
the
month
was
out
,
Peggotty
and
I
were
ready
to
depart
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
came
into
the
house
for
Peggotty
's
boxes
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
never
known
him
to
pass
the
garden
-
gate
before
,
but
on
this
occasion
he
came
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
gave
me
a
look
as
he
shouldered
the
largest
box
and
went
out
,
which
I
thought
had
meaning
in
it
,
if
meaning
could
ever
be
said
to
find
its
way
into
Mr
Barkis
's
visage
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
was
naturally
in
low
spirits
at
leaving
what
had
been
her
home
<EOS>
so
many
years
,
and
where
the
two
strong
attachments
of
her
life
---
for
my
mother
and
myself
---
had
been
formed
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
walking
in
the
churchyard
,
too
,
very
early
;
and
she
got
into
the
cart
,
and
sat
in
it
with
her
handkerchief
at
her
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
So
long
as
she
remained
in
this
condition
,
Mr
Barkis
gave
no
sign
of
life
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
in
his
usual
place
and
attitude
like
a
great
stuffed
figure
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
she
began
to
look
about
her
,
and
to
speak
to
me
,
he
nodded
his
head
and
grinned
several
times
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
least
notion
at
whom
,
or
what
he
meant
by
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
beautiful
day
,
Mr
Barkis
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
as
an
act
of
politeness
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
bad
,
"
said
Mr
Barkis
,
who
generally
qualified
his
speech
,
and
rarely
committed
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Peggotty
is
quite
comfortable
now
,
Mr
Barkis
,
"
I
remarked
,
for
his
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
she
,
though
?
"
said
Mr
Barkis
.
   
<EOS>
After
reflecting
about
it
,
with
a
sagacious
air
,
Mr
Barkis
eyed
her
,
and
said
:
   
"
ARE
you
pretty
comfortable
?
"
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
laughed
,
and
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
really
and
truly
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
?
"
<EOS>
growled
Mr
Barkis
,
sliding
nearer
to
her
on
the
seat
,
and
nudging
her
with
his
elbow
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
?
 
<EOS>
Really
and
truly
pretty
comfortable
?
 
<EOS>
Are
you
?
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
At
each
of
these
inquiries
Mr
Barkis
shuffled
nearer
to
her
,
and
gave
her
another
nudge
;
so
that
at
last
we
were
all
crowded
together
in
the
left
-
hand
corner
of
the
cart
,
and
<EOS>
I
was
so
squeezed
that
I
could
hardly
bear
it
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
calling
his
attention
to
my
sufferings
,
Mr
Barkis
gave
me
a
little
more
room
at
once
,
and
got
away
by
degrees
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
help
observing
that
he
seemed
to
think
he
had
hit
upon
a
wonderful
expedient
for
expressing
himself
in
a
neat
,
agreeable
,
and
pointed
manner
,
without
the
inconvenience
of
inventing
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
He
manifestly
chuckled
over
it
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
By
and
<EOS>
by
he
turned
to
Peggotty
again
,
and
repeating
,
"
Are
you
pretty
comfortable
though
?
"
<EOS>
bore
down
upon
us
as
before
,
until
the
breath
was
nearly
edged
out
of
my
body
.
 
<EOS>
By
and
by
he
made
another
descent
upon
us
with
the
same
inquiry
,
and
the
same
result
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
I
got
up
whenever
I
saw
him
coming
,
and
standing
on
the
foot
-
board
,
pretended
to
look
at
the
prospect
;
after
which
I
did
very
well
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
so
polite
as
to
stop
at
a
public
-
house
,
expressly
on
our
account
,
and
entertain
us
with
broiled
mutton
and
beer
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
Peggotty
was
in
the
act
of
drinking
,
he
was
seized
with
one
of
those
approaches
,
and
almost
choked
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
we
drew
nearer
to
the
end
of
our
journey
,
he
had
more
to
do
and
less
time
for
gallantry
;
and
when
we
got
on
Yarmouth
pavement
,
we
were
all
too
much
shaken
and
jolted
,
I
apprehend
,
to
have
any
leisure
for
anything
else
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
and
Ham
waited
for
us
at
the
old
place
.
 
<EOS>
They
received
me
and
Peggotty
in
an
affectionate
manner
,
and
shook
hands
with
Mr
Barkis
,
who
,
with
his
hat
on
the
very
back
of
his
head
,
and
a
shame
-
faced
leer
upon
his
countenance
,
and
pervading
his
very
legs
,
presented
but
a
vacant
appearance
,
I
thought
.
 
<EOS>
They
each
took
one
of
Peggotty
's
trunks
,
and
we
were
going
away
,
when
Mr
Barkis
solemnly
made
a
sign
to
me
with
his
forefinger
to
come
under
an
archway
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
growled
Mr
Barkis
,
"
it
was
all
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
looked
up
into
his
face
,
and
answered
,
with
an
attempt
to
be
very
profound
:
"
Oh
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
did
n't
come
to
a
end
there
,
"
said
Mr
Barkis
,
nodding
confidentially
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
all
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
Again
I
answered
,
"
Oh
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
who
was
willin
'
,
"
said
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
Barkis
,
and
Barkis
only
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
nodded
assent
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
right
,
"
said
Mr
Barkis
,
shaking
hands
;
"
I
'm
a
friend
of
your'n
.
 
<EOS>
You
made
it
all
right
,
first
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
his
attempts
to
be
particularly
lucid
,
Mr
Barkis
was
so
extremely
mysterious
,
that
I
might
have
stood
looking
in
his
face
for
an
hour
,
and
most
assuredly
should
have
got
as
much
information
out
of
it
as
out
of
the
face
of
a
clock
that
had
stopped
,
but
for
Peggotty
's
calling
me
away
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
were
going
along
,
she
asked
me
what
he
had
said
;
and
I
told
her
he
had
said
it
was
all
right
.
   
<EOS>
"
Like
his
impudence
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
mind
that
!
 
<EOS>
Davy
dear
,
what
should
you
think
if
I
was
to
think
of
being
married
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
---
I
suppose
you
would
like
me
as
much
then
,
Peggotty
,
as
you
do
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
returned
,
after
a
little
consideration
.
   
<EOS>
Greatly
to
the
astonishment
of
the
passengers
in
the
street
,
as
well
as
of
her
relations
going
on
before
,
the
good
soul
was
obliged
to
stop
and
embrace
me
on
the
spot
,
with
many
protestations
of
her
unalterable
love
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
what
should
you
say
,
darling
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
again
,
when
this
was
over
,
and
we
were
walking
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
thinking
of
being
married
---
to
Mr
Barkis
,
Peggotty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
.
 
<EOS>
For
then
you
know
,
Peggotty
,
you
would
always
have
the
horse
and
cart
to
bring
you
over
to
see
me
,
and
could
come
for
nothing
,
and
be
sure
of
coming
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
sense
of
the
dear
!
"
cried
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
I
have
been
thinking
of
,
this
month
back
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
precious
;
and
I
think
I
should
be
more
independent
altogether
<EOS>
,
you
see
;
let
alone
my
working
with
a
better
heart
in
my
own
house
,
than
I
could
in
anybody
else
's
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
I
might
be
fit
for
,
now
,
as
a
servant
to
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
shall
be
always
near
my
pretty
's
resting
-
place
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
musing
,
"
and
be
able
to
see
it
when
I
like
;
and
when
I
lie
down
to
rest
,
I
may
be
laid
not
far
off
from
my
darling
girl
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
neither
of
us
said
anything
for
a
little
while
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
would
n't
so
much
as
give
it
another
thought
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
cheerily
"
if
my
Davy
was
anyways
against
it
---
not
if
I
had
been
asked
in
church
thirty
times
three
times
over
,
and
was
wearing
out
the
ring
in
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Look
at
me
,
Peggotty
,
"
I
replied
;
"
and
see
if
I
am
not
really
glad
,
and
do
n't
truly
wish
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
As
indeed
I
did
,
with
all
my
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
life
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
giving
me
a
squeeze
,
"
I
have
thought
of
it
night
and
day
,
every
way
I
can
,
and
I
hope
the
right
way
;
but
I
'll
think
of
it
again
,
and
speak
to
my
brother
about
it
,
and
in
the
meantime
we
'll
keep
it
to
ourselves
,
Davy
,
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
Barkis
is
a
good
plain
creature
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
"
and
if
I
tried
to
do
my
duty
by
him
,
I
think
it
would
be
my
fault
if
I
was
n't
---
if
I
was
n't
pretty
comfortable
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
laughing
heartily
.
<EOS>
This
quotation
from
Mr
Barkis
was
so
appropriate
,
and
tickled
us
both
so
much
,
that
we
laughed
again
and
again
,
and
were
quite
in
a
pleasant
humour
when
we
came
within
view
of
Mr
Peggotty
's
cottage
.
   
<EOS>
It
looked
just
the
same
,
except
that
it
may
,
perhaps
,
have
shrunk
a
little
in
my
eyes
;
and
Mrs
Gummidge
was
waiting
at
the
door
as
if
she
had
stood
there
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
All
within
was
the
same
,
down
to
the
seaweed
in
the
blue
mug
in
my
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
into
the
out
-
house
to
look
about
me
;
and
the
very
same
lobsters
,
crabs
,
and
crawfish
possessed
by
the
same
desire
to
pinch
the
world
in
general
,
appeared
to
be
in
the
same
state
of
conglomeration
in
the
   
same
old
corner
.
   
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
little
Em'ly
to
be
seen
,
so
I
asked
Mr
Peggotty
where
she
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
's
at
school
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
wiping
the
heat
consequent
on
the
porterage
of
Peggotty
's
box
from
his
forehead
;
"
she
'll
be
home
,
"
looking
at
the
Dutch
clock
,
"
in
from
twenty
minutes
to
half
-
an
-
hour
's
time
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
on
us
feel
the
loss
of
her
,
bless
ye
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
moaned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Cheer
up
,
Mawther
!
"
cried
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
feel
it
more
than
anybody
else
,
"
said
Mrs
Gummidge
;
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
lone
lorn
creetur
'
,
and
she
used
to
be
a'most
the
only
thing
that
did
n't
go
contrary
with
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
,
whimpering
and
shaking
her
head
,
applied
herself
to
blowing
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
,
looking
round
upon
us
while
she
was
so
engaged
,
said
in
a
low
voice
,
which
he
shaded
with
his
hand
:
"
The
old
'
un
!
"
 
<EOS>
From
this
I
rightly
conjectured
that
no
improvement
had
taken
place
since
my
last
visit
in
the
state
of
Mrs
Gummidge
's
spirits
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
the
whole
place
was
,
or
it
should
have
been
,
quite
as
delightful
a
place
as
ever
;
and
yet
it
did
not
impress
me
in
the
same
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
rather
disappointed
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
because
little
Em'ly
was
not
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
the
way
by
which
she
would
come
,
and
presently
found
myself
strolling
along
the
path
to
meet
her
.
   
<EOS>
A
figure
appeared
in
the
distance
before
long
,
and
I
soon
knew
it
to
be
Em'ly
,
who
was
a
little
creature
still
in
stature
,
though
she
was
grown
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
she
drew
nearer
,
and
I
saw
her
blue
eyes
looking
bluer
,
and
her
dimpled
face
looking
brighter
,
and
her
whole
self
prettier
and
gayer
,
a
curious
feeling
came
over
me
that
made
me
pretend
not
to
know
her
,
and
pass
by
as
if
I
were
looking
at
something
a
long
way
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
done
such
a
thing
since
in
later
life
,
or
I
am
mistaken
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Em'ly
did
n't
care
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
She
saw
me
well
enough
;
but
instead
of
turning
round
and
calling
after
me
,
ran
away
laughing
.
<EOS>
This
obliged
me
to
run
after
her
,
and
she
ran
so
fast
that
we
were
very
near
the
cottage
before
I
caught
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
it
's
you
,
is
it
?
"
said
little
Em'ly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
you
knew
who
it
was
,
Em'ly
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
And
did
n't
YOU
know
who
it
was
?
"
said
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
kiss
her
,
but
she
covered
her
cherry
lips
with
her
hands
,
and
said
she
was
n't
a
baby
now
,
and
ran
away
,
laughing
more
than
ever
,
into
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
delight
in
teasing
me
,
which
was
a
change
in
her
<EOS>
I
wondered
at
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
The
tea
table
was
ready
,
and
our
little
locker
was
put
out
in
its
old
place
,
but
instead
of
coming
to
sit
by
me
,
she
went
and
bestowed
her
company
upon
that
grumbling
Mrs
Gummidge
:
and
on
Mr
Peggotty
's
inquiring
<EOS>
why
,
rumpled
her
hair
all
over
her
face
to
hide
it
,
and
could
do
nothing
but
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
little
puss
,
it
is
!
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
patting
her
with
his
great
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
sh
'
is
!
 
<EOS>
so
sh
'
is
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ham
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mas'r
Davy
bor
'
,
so
sh
'
is
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
sat
and
chuckled
at
her
for
some
time
,
in
a
state
of
mingled
admiration
and
delight
<EOS>
,
that
made
his
face
a
burning
red
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Em'ly
was
spoiled
by
them
all
,
in
fact
;
and
by
no
one
more
than
Mr
Peggotty
himself
,
whom
she
could
have
coaxed
into
anything
,
by
only
going
and
laying
her
cheek
against
his
rough
whisker
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
my
opinion
,
at
least
,
when
I
saw
her
do
it
;
and
I
held
Mr
Peggotty
to
be
thoroughly
in
the
right
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
was
so
affectionate
and
sweet
-
natured
,
and
had
such
a
pleasant
manner
of
being
both
sly
and
shy
at
once
,
that
she
captivated
me
more
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
tender
-
hearted
,
too
;
for
when
,
as
we
sat
round
the
fire
after
tea
,
an
allusion
was
made
by
Mr
Peggotty
over
his
pipe
to
the
loss
I
had
sustained
,
the
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
,
and
she
looked
at
me
so
kindly
across
the
table
,
that
I
felt
quite
thankful
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
taking
up
her
curls
,
and
running
them
over
his
hand
like
water
,
"
here
's
another
orphan
<EOS>
,
you
see
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
giving
Ham
a
backhanded
knock
in
the
chest
,
"
is
another
of
'em
,
though
he
do
n't
look
much
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
I
had
you
for
my
guardian
,
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
said
I
,
shaking
my
head
,
"
I
do
n't
think
I
should
FEEL
much
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
said
,
Mas'r
Davy
bor
'
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ham
,
in
an
ecstasy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hoorah
!
<EOS>
Well
said
!
 
<EOS>
Nor
more
you
would
n't
!
 
<EOS>
Hor
!
 
<EOS>
Hor
!
"
<EOS>
---
Here
he
returned
Mr
Peggotty
's
back
-
hander
,
and
little
Em'ly
got
up
and
kissed
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
how
's
your
friend
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Steerforth
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
name
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Peggotty
,
turning
to
Ham
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
knowed
it
was
something
in
our
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
said
it
was
Rudderford
,
"
observed
Ham
,
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
retorted
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
ye
steer
with
a
rudder
,
do
n't
ye
?
 
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
fur
off
.
 
<EOS>
How
is
he
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
very
well
indeed
when
I
came
away
,
Mr
Peggotty
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
friend
!
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
stretching
out
his
pipe
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
friend
,
if
you
talk
of
friends
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Lord
love
my
heart
alive
,
if
it
ai
n't
a
treat
to
look
at
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
very
handsome
,
is
he
not
?
"
<EOS>
said
I
,
my
heart
warming
with
this
praise
.
   
<EOS>
"
Handsome
!
"
cried
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
stands
up
to
you
like
---
like
a
---
why
I
do
n't
know
what
he
do
n't
stand
up
to
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
so
bold
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
just
his
character
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
as
brave
as
a
lion
,
and
you
ca
n't
think
how
frank
he
is
,
Mr
Peggotty
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
do
suppose
,
now
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
looking
at
me
through
the
smoke
of
his
pipe
,
"
that
in
the
way
of
book
-
larning
he
'd
take
the
wind
out
of
a'most
anything
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
I
,
delighted
;
"
he
knows
everything
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
astonishingly
clever
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
friend
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
Mr
Peggotty
,
with
a
grave
toss
of
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
seems
to
cost
him
any
trouble
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
He
knows
a
task
if
he
only
looks
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
the
best
cricketer
you
ever
saw
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
give
you
almost
as
many
men
as
you
like
at
draughts
,
and
beat
you
easily
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
gave
his
head
another
toss
,
as
much
as
to
say
:
"
Of
course
he
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
such
a
speaker
,
"
I
pursued
,
"
that
he
can
win
anybody
over
;
and
I
do
n't
know
what
you
'd
say
if
you
were
to
hear
him
sing
,
Mr
Peggotty
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
gave
his
head
another
toss
,
as
much
as
to
say
:
"
I
have
no
doubt
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
he
's
such
a
generous
,
fine
,
noble
fellow
,
"
said
I
,
quite
carried
away
by
my
favourite
theme
,
"
that
it
's
hardly
possible
to
give
him
as
much
praise
as
he
deserves
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
can
never
feel
thankful
enough
for
the
generosity
with
which
he
has
protected
me
,
so
much
younger
and
lower
in
the
school
than
himself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
running
on
,
very
fast
indeed
,
when
my
eyes
rested
on
little
Em'ly
's
face
,
which
was
bent
forward
over
the
table
,
listening
with
the
deepest
attention
,
her
breath
held
,
her
blue
eyes
sparkling
like
jewels
,
and
the
colour
mantling
in
her
cheeks
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
so
extraordinarily
earnest
and
pretty
,
that
I
stopped
in
a
sort
of
wonder
;
and
they
all
observed
her
at
the
same
time
,
for
as
I
stopped
,
they
laughed
and
looked
at
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Em'ly
is
like
me
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
"
and
would
like
to
see
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Em'ly
was
confused
by
our
all
observing
her
,
and
hung
down
her
head
,
and
her
face
was
covered
with
blushes
.
 
<EOS>
Glancing
up
presently
through
her
stray
curls
,
and
seeing
that
we
were
all
looking
at
her
still
<EOS>
(
I
am
sure
I
,
for
one
,
could
have
looked
at
her
for
hours
)
,
she
ran
away
,
and
kept
away
till
it
was
nearly
bedtime
.
   
<EOS>
I
lay
down
in
the
old
little
bed
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
,
and
the
wind
came
moaning
on
across
the
flat
as
it
had
done
before
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
help
fancying
,
now
,
that
it
moaned
of
those
who
were
gone
;
and
instead
of
thinking
that
the
sea
might
rise
in
the
night
and
float
the
boat
away
,
I
thought
of
the
sea
that
had
risen
,
since
I
last
heard
those
sounds
,
and
drowned
my
happy
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
,
as
the
wind
and
water
began
to
sound
fainter
in
my
ears
,
putting
a
short
clause
into
my
prayers
,
petitioning
that
I
might
grow
up
to
marry
little
Em'ly
,
and
so
dropping
lovingly
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
The
days
passed
pretty
much
as
they
had
passed
before
,
except
---
it
was
a
great
exception
---
<EOS>
that
little
Em'ly
and
I
seldom
wandered
on
the
beach
now
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
tasks
to
learn
,
and
needle
-
work
to
do
;
and
was
absent
during
a
great
part
of
each
day
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
felt
that
we
should
not
have
had
those
old
wanderings
,
even
if
it
had
been
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
Wild
and
full
of
childish
whims
as
Em'ly
was
<EOS>
,
she
was
more
of
a
little
woman
than
I
had
supposed
.
 
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
have
got
a
great
distance
away
from
me
,
in
little
more
than
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
She
liked
me
,
but
she
laughed
at
me
,
and
tormented
me
;
and
when
I
went
to
meet
her
,
stole
home
another
way
,
and
was
laughing
at
the
door
when
I
came
back
,
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
The
best
times
were
when
she
sat
quietly
at
work
in
the
doorway
,
and
I
sat
on
the
wooden
step
at
her
feet
,
reading
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
,
at
this
hour
,
that
I
have
never
seen
such
sunlight
as
on
those
bright
April
afternoons
;
that
I
have
never
seen
such
a
sunny
little
figure
as
I
used
to
see
,
sitting
in
the
doorway
of
the
old
boat
;
that
I
have
never
beheld
such
sky
,
such
water
,
such
glorified
ships
sailing
away
into
golden
air
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
very
first
evening
after
our
arrival
,
Mr
Barkis
appeared
in
an
exceedingly
vacant
and
awkward
condition
,
and
with
a
bundle
of
oranges
tied
up
in
a
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
made
no
allusion
of
any
kind
to
this
property
,
he
was
supposed
to
have
left
it
behind
him
by
accident
when
he
went
away
;
until
Ham
,
running
after
him
to
restore
it
,
came
back
with
the
information
that
it
was
intended
for
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
After
that
occasion
he
appeared
every
evening
at
exactly
the
same
hour
,
and
always
with
a
little
bundle
,
to
which
he
never
alluded
,
and
which
he
regularly
put
behind
the
door
and
left
there
.
<EOS>
These
offerings
of
affection
were
of
a
most
various
and
eccentric
description
.
 
<EOS>
Among
them
I
remember
a
double
set
of
pigs
'
trotters
,
a
huge
pin
-
cushion
,
half
a
bushel
or
so
of
apples
,
a
pair
of
jet
earrings
,
some
Spanish
onions
,
a
box
of
dominoes
,
a
canary
bird
and
cage
,
and
a
leg
of
pickled
pork
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
's
wooing
,
as
I
remember
it
,
was
altogether
of
a
peculiar
kind
.
 
<EOS>
He
very
seldom
said
anything
;
but
would
sit
by
the
fire
in
much
the
same
attitude
as
he
sat
in
his
cart
,
and
stare
heavily
at
Peggotty
,
who
was
opposite
.
 
<EOS>
One
night
,
being
,
as
I
suppose
,
inspired
by
love
,
he
made
a
dart
at
the
bit
of
wax
-
candle
<EOS>
she
kept
for
her
thread
,
and
put
it
in
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
and
carried
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
After
that
,
his
great
delight
was
to
produce
it
when
it
was
wanted
,
sticking
to
the
lining
of
his
pocket
,
in
a
partially
melted
state
,
and
pocket
it
again
when
it
was
done
with
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
enjoy
himself
very
much
,
and
not
to
feel
at
all
called
upon
to
talk
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
he
took
Peggotty
out
for
a
walk
on
the
flats
,
he
had
no
uneasiness
on
that
head
,
I
believe
;
contenting
himself
with
now
and
then
asking
her
if
she
was
pretty
comfortable
;
and
I
remember
that
sometimes
,
after
he
was
gone
,
Peggotty
would
throw
her
apron
over
her
face
,
and
laugh
for
half
-
an
-
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
we
were
all
more
or
less
amused
,
except
that
miserable
Mrs
Gummidge
,
whose
courtship
would
appear
to
have
been
of
an
exactly
parallel
nature
,
she
was
so
continually
reminded
by
these
transactions
of
the
old
one
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
,
when
the
term
of
my
visit
was
nearly
expired
,
it
was
given
out
that
Peggotty
and
Mr
Barkis
were
going
to
make
a
day
's
holiday
together
,
and
that
little
Em'ly
<EOS>
and
I
were
to
accompany
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
but
<EOS>
a
broken
sleep
the
night
before
,
in
anticipation
of
the
pleasure
of
a
whole
day
with
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
all
astir
betimes
in
the
morning
;
and
while
we
were
yet
at
breakfast
,
Mr
Barkis
appeared
in
the
distance
,
driving
a
chaise
-
cart
towards
the
object
of
his
affections
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
was
dressed
as
usual
,
in
her
neat
and
quiet
mourning
;
but
Mr
Barkis
bloomed
in
a
new
blue
coat
,
of
which
the
tailor
had
given
him
such
good
measure
,
that
the
cuffs
would
have
rendered
gloves
unnecessary
in
the
coldest
weather
,
while
the
collar
was
so
high
that
it
pushed
his
hair
up
on
end
on
the
top
of
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
His
bright
buttons
,
too
,
were
of
the
largest
size
.
 
<EOS>
Rendered
complete
by
drab
pantaloons
and
a
buff
waistcoat
<EOS>
,
I
thought
Mr
Barkis
a
phenomenon
of
respectability
.
   
<EOS>
When
we
were
all
in
a
bustle
outside
the
door
,
I
found
that
Mr
Peggotty
was
prepared
with
an
old
shoe
,
which
was
to
be
thrown
after
us
for
luck
,
and
which
he
offered
to
Mrs
Gummidge
for
that
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
better
be
done
by
somebody
else
,
Dan'l
,
"
said
Mrs
Gummidge
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
lone
lorn
creetur
'
myself
,
and
everythink
that
reminds
me
of
creetur
's
that
ai
n't
lone
and
lorn
,
goes
contrary
with
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
old
gal
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
and
heave
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Dan'l
,
"
returned
Mrs
Gummidge
,
whimpering
and
shaking
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
felt
less
,
I
could
do
more
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
feel
like
me
,
Dan'l
;
thinks
do
n't
go
contrary
with
you
,
nor
you
with
them
;
you
had
better
do
it
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
here
Peggotty
,
who
had
been
going
about
from
one
to
another
in
a
hurried
way
,
kissing
everybody
,
called
out
from
the
cart
,
in
which
we
all
were
by
this
time
<EOS>
(
Em'ly
and
I
on
two
little
chairs
,
side
by
side
)
,
that
Mrs
Gummidge
must
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
Mrs
Gummidge
did
it
;
and
,
I
am
sorry
to
relate
,
cast
a
damp
upon
the
festive
character
of
our
departure
,
by
immediately
bursting
into
tears
,
and
sinking
subdued
into
the
arms
of
Ham
,
with
the
declaration
that
she
knowed
she
was
a
burden
,
and
had
better
be
carried
to
the
House
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
Which
I
really
thought
was
a
sensible
idea
,
that
Ham
might
have
acted
on
.
   
<EOS>
Away
we
went
,
however
,
on
our
holiday
excursion
;
and
the
first
thing
we
did
was
to
stop
at
a
church
,
where
Mr
Barkis
tied
the
horse
to
some
rails
,
and
went
in
with
Peggotty
,
leaving
little
Em'ly
and
me
alone
in
the
chaise
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
that
occasion
to
put
my
arm
round
Em'ly
's
waist
,
and
propose
that
as
I
was
going
away
so
very
soon
now
,
we
should
determine
to
be
very
affectionate
to
one
another
,
and
very
happy
,
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Em'ly
consenting
,
and
allowing
me
to
kiss
her
<EOS>
,
I
became
desperate
;
informing
her
,
I
recollect
,
that
I
never
could
love
another
,
and
that
I
was
prepared
to
shed
the
blood
of
anybody
who
should
aspire
to
her
affections
.
   
<EOS>
How
merry
little
Em'ly
made
herself
about
it
!
 
<EOS>
With
what
a
demure
assumption
of
being
immensely
older
and
wiser
than
I
,
the
fairy
little
woman
said
I
was
"
a
silly
boy
"
;
and
then
laughed
so
charmingly
that
I
forgot
the
pain
of
being
called
by
that
disparaging
name
,
in
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
her
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
and
Peggotty
were
a
good
while
in
the
church
,
but
came
out
at
last
,
and
then
we
drove
away
into
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
were
going
along
,
Mr
Barkis
turned
to
me
,
and
said
,
with
a
wink
,
---
by
the
by
,
I
should
hardly
have
thought
,
before
,
that
he
could
wink
:
   
"
What
name
was
it
as
I
wrote
up
in
the
cart
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Clara
Peggotty
,
<EOS>
"
I
answered
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
name
would
it
be
as
I
should
write
up
now
,
if
there
was
a
tilt
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Clara
Peggotty
,
again
?
<EOS>
"
I
suggested
.
   
<EOS>
"
Clara
Peggotty
BARKIS
!
"
<EOS>
he
returned
,
and
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
that
shook
the
chaise
.
   
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
they
were
married
,
and
had
gone
into
the
church
for
no
other
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
was
resolved
that
it
should
be
quietly
done
;
and
the
clerk
had
given
her
away
,
and
there
had
been
no
witnesses
of
the
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
little
confused
when
Mr
Barkis
made
this
abrupt
announcement
of
their
union
,
and
could
not
hug
me
enough
in
token
of
her
unimpaired
affection
;
but
she
soon
became
herself
again
,
and
said
she
was
very
glad
it
was
over
.
   
<EOS>
We
drove
to
a
little
inn
in
a
by
-
road
,
where
we
were
expected
,
and
where
we
had
a
very
comfortable
dinner
,
and
passed
the
day
with
great
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
If
Peggotty
had
been
married
every
day
for
the
last
ten
years
,
she
could
hardly
have
been
more
at
her
ease
about
it
;
it
made
no
sort
of
difference
in
her
:
she
was
just
the
same
as
ever
,
and
went
out
for
a
stroll
with
little
Em'ly
and
me
before
tea
,
while
Mr
Barkis
philosophically
smoked
his
pipe
,
and
enjoyed
himself
,
I
suppose
,
with
the
contemplation
of
his
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
If
so
,
it
sharpened
his
appetite
;
for
I
distinctly
call
to
mind
that
,
although
he
had
eaten
a
good
deal
of
pork
and
greens
at
dinner
,
and
had
finished
off
with
a
fowl
or
two
,
he
was
obliged
to
have
cold
boiled
bacon
for
tea
,
and
disposed
of
a
large
quantity
without
any
emotion
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
often
thought
,
since
,
what
an
odd
,
innocent
,
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
kind
of
wedding
it
must
have
been
!
 
<EOS>
We
got
into
the
chaise
again
soon
after
dark
,
and
drove
cosily
back
,
looking
up
at
the
stars
,
and
talking
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
their
chief
exponent
,
and
opened
Mr
Barkis
's
mind
to
an
amazing
extent
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
all
I
knew
,
but
he
would
have
believed
anything
I
might
have
taken
it
into
my
head
to
impart
to
him
;
for
he
had
a
profound
veneration
for
my
abilities
,
and
informed
his
wife
in
my
hearing
,
on
that
very
occasion
,
that
I
was
"
a
young
Roeshus
"
---
by
which
I
think
he
meant
prodigy
.
   
<EOS>
When
we
had
exhausted
the
subject
of
the
stars
,
or
rather
when
I
had
exhausted
the
mental
faculties
of
Mr
Barkis
,
little
Em'ly
<EOS>
and
I
made
a
cloak
of
an
old
wrapper
,
and
sat
under
it
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
how
I
loved
her
!
 
<EOS>
What
happiness
(
I
thought
)
if
we
were
married
,
and
were
going
away
anywhere
to
live
among
the
trees
and
<EOS>
in
the
fields
,
never
growing
older
,
never
growing
wiser
,
children
ever
,
rambling
hand
in
hand
through
sunshine
and
among
flowery
meadows
,
laying
down
our
heads
on
moss
at
night
,
in
a
sweet
sleep
of
purity
and
peace
,
and
buried
by
the
birds
when
we
were
dead
!
 
<EOS>
Some
such
picture
,
with
no
real
world
in
it
,
bright
with
the
light
of
our
innocence
,
and
vague
as
the
stars
afar
off
,
was
in
my
mind
all
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
think
there
were
two
such
guileless
hearts
at
Peggotty
's
marriage
as
little
Em'ly
's
and
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
think
the
Loves
and
Graces
took
such
airy
forms
in
its
homely
procession
.
   
<EOS>
Well
,
we
came
to
the
old
boat
again
in
good
time
at
night
;
and
there
Mr
and
Mrs
Barkis
bade
us
good
-
bye
,
and
drove
away
snugly
to
their
own
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
I
had
lost
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
gone
to
bed
with
a
sore
heart
indeed
under
any
other
roof
but
that
which
sheltered
little
Em'ly
's
head
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
and
Ham
knew
what
was
in
my
thoughts
as
well
as
I
did
,
and
were
ready
with
some
supper
and
their
hospitable
faces
to
drive
it
away
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Em'ly
came
and
sat
beside
me
on
the
locker
for
the
only
time
in
all
that
visit
;
and
it
was
altogether
a
wonderful
close
to
a
wonderful
day
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
night
tide
;
and
soon
after
we
went
to
bed
,
Mr
Peggotty
and
Ham
went
out
to
fish
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
very
brave
at
being
left
alone
in
the
solitary
house
,
the
protector
of
Em'ly
and
Mrs
Gummidge
,
and
only
wished
that
a
lion
or
a
serpent
,
or
any
ill
-
disposed
monster
,
would
make
an
attack
upon
us
,
that
I
might
destroy
him
,
and
cover
myself
with
glory
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
nothing
of
the
sort
happened
to
be
walking
about
on
Yarmouth
flats
that
night
,
I
provided
the
best
substitute
I
could
by
dreaming
of
dragons
until
morning
.
   
<EOS>
With
morning
came
Peggotty
;
who
called
to
me
,
as
usual
,
under
my
window
as
if
Mr
Barkis
the
carrier
had
been
from
first
to
last
a
dream
too
.
 
<EOS>
After
breakfast
she
took
me
to
her
own
home
,
and
a
beautiful
little
home
<EOS>
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Of
all
the
moveables
in
it
,
I
must
have
been
impressed
by
a
certain
old
bureau
of
some
dark
wood
in
the
parlour
<EOS>
(
the
tile
-
floored
kitchen
was
the
general
sitting
-
room
)
,
with
a
retreating
top
which
opened
,
let
down
,
and
became
a
desk
,
within
which
was
a
large
quarto
edition
of
Foxe
's
Book
of
Martyrs
.
 
<EOS>
This
precious
volume
,
of
which
I
do
not
recollect
one
word
<EOS>
,
I
immediately
discovered
and
immediately
applied
myself
to
;
and
I
never
visited
the
house
afterwards
,
but
I
kneeled
on
a
chair
,
opened
the
casket
where
this
gem
was
enshrined
,
spread
my
arms
over
the
desk
,
and
fell
to
devouring
the
book
afresh
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
chiefly
edified
,
I
am
afraid
,
by
the
pictures
,
which
were
numerous
,
and
represented
all
kinds
of
dismal
horrors
;
but
the
Martyrs
and
Peggotty
's
house
have
been
inseparable
in
my
mind
ever
since
,
and
are
now
.
   
<EOS>
I
took
leave
of
Mr
Peggotty
,
and
Ham
,
and
Mrs
Gummidge
,
and
little
Em'ly
,
that
day
;
and
passed
the
night
at
Peggotty
's
,
in
a
little
room
in
the
roof
(
with
the
Crocodile
Book
on
a
shelf
by
the
bed
's
head
)
which
was
to
be
always
mine
,
Peggotty
said
,
and
should
always
be
kept
for
me
in
exactly
the
same
state
.
   
<EOS>
"
Young
or
old
,
Davy
dear
,
as
long
as
I
am
alive
and
have
this
house
over
my
head
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
"
you
shall
find
it
as
if
I
expected
you
here
directly
minute
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
keep
it
every
day
,
as
I
used
to
keep
your
old
little
room
,
my
darling
;
and
if
you
was
to
go
to
China
,
you
might
think
of
it
as
being
kept
just
the
same
,
all
the
time
you
were
away
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
felt
the
truth
and
constancy
of
my
dear
old
nurse
,
with
all
my
heart
,
and
thanked
her
as
well
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
not
very
well
,
for
she
spoke
to
me
thus
,
with
her
arms
round
my
neck
,
in
the
morning
,
and
I
was
going
home
in
the
morning
,
and
I
went
home
in
the
morning
,
with
herself
and
Mr
Barkis
in
the
cart
.
 
<EOS>
They
left
me
at
the
gate
,
not
easily
or
lightly
;
and
it
was
a
strange
sight
to
me
to
see
the
cart
go
on
,
taking
Peggotty
away
,
and
leaving
me
under
the
old
elm
-
trees
looking
at
the
house
,
in
which
there
was
no
face
to
look
on
mine
with
love
or
liking
any
more
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
I
fell
into
a
state
of
neglect
,
which
I
can
not
look
back
upon
without
compassion
.
 
<EOS>
I
fell
at
once
into
a
solitary
condition
,
---
apart
from
all
friendly
notice
,
apart
from
the
society
of
all
other
boys
of
my
own
age
,
apart
from
all
companionship
but
my
own
spiritless
thoughts
,
---
which
seems
to
cast
its
gloom
upon
this
paper
as
I
write
.
   
<EOS>
What
would
I
have
given
,
to
have
been
sent
to
the
hardest
school
that
ever
was
kept
!
---
<EOS>
to
have
been
taught
something
,
anyhow
,
anywhere
!
 
<EOS>
No
such
hope
dawned
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
disliked
me
;
and
they
sullenly
,
sternly
,
steadily
,
overlooked
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
Mr
Murdstone
's
means
were
straitened
at
about
this
time
;
but
it
is
little
to
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
me
;
and
in
putting
me
from
him
he
tried
,
as
I
believe
,
to
put
away
the
notion
that
I
had
any
claim
upon
him
---
and
succeeded
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
not
actively
ill
-
used
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
beaten
,
or
starved
;
but
the
wrong
that
was
done
to
me
had
no
intervals
of
relenting
,
and
was
done
in
a
systematic
,
passionless
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Day
after
day
,
week
after
week
,
month
after
month
,
I
was
coldly
neglected
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
sometimes
,
when
I
think
of
it
,
what
they
would
have
done
if
I
had
been
taken
with
an
illness
;
whether
I
should
have
lain
down
in
my
lonely
room
,
and
languished
through
it
in
my
usual
solitary
way
,
or
whether
anybody
would
have
helped
me
out
.
   
<EOS>
When
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
were
at
home
,
I
took
my
meals
with
them
;
in
their
absence
,
I
ate
and
drank
by
myself
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
times
I
lounged
about
the
house
and
neighbourhood
quite
disregarded
,
except
that
they
were
jealous
of
my
making
any
friends
:
thinking
,
perhaps
,
that
if
I
did
,
I
might
complain
to
someone
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
reason
,
though
Mr
Chillip
often
asked
me
to
go
and
see
him
<EOS>
(
he
was
a
widower
,
having
,
<EOS>
some
years
before
that
,
lost
a
little
small
light
-
haired
wife
,
whom
I
can
just
remember
connecting
in
my
own
thoughts
with
a
pale
tortoise
-
shell
cat
)
,
it
was
but
seldom
that
I
enjoyed
the
happiness
of
passing
an
afternoon
in
his
closet
of
a
surgery
;
reading
some
book
that
was
new
to
me
,
with
the
smell
of
the
whole
Pharmacopoeia
coming
up
my
nose
,
or
pounding
something
in
a
mortar
under
his
mild
directions
.
   
<EOS>
For
the
same
reason
,
added
no
doubt
to
the
old
dislike
of
her
,
I
was
seldom
allowed
to
visit
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
Faithful
to
her
promise
,
she
either
came
to
see
me
,
or
met
me
somewhere
near
,
once
every
week
,
and
never
empty
-
handed
;
but
many
and
bitter
were
the
disappointments
I
had
,
in
being
refused
permission
to
pay
a
visit
to
her
at
her
house
.
 
<EOS>
Some
few
times
,
however
,
at
long
intervals
,
I
was
allowed
to
go
there
;
and
then
I
found
out
that
Mr
Barkis
was
something
of
a
miser
,
or
as
Peggotty
dutifully
expressed
it
,
was
"
a
little
near
"
,
and
kept
a
heap
of
money
in
a
box
under
his
bed
,
which
he
pretended
was
only
full
of
coats
and
trousers
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
coffer
,
his
riches
hid
themselves
with
such
a
tenacious
modesty
,
that
the
smallest
instalments
could
only
be
tempted
out
by
artifice
;
so
that
Peggotty
had
to
prepare
a
long
and
elaborate
scheme
,
a
very
Gunpowder
Plot
,
for
every
Saturday
's
expenses
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
time
I
was
so
conscious
of
the
waste
of
any
promise
I
had
given
,
and
of
my
being
utterly
neglected
,
that
I
should
have
been
perfectly
miserable
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
but
for
the
old
books
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
my
only
comfort
;
and
I
was
as
true
to
them
as
they
were
to
me
,
and
read
them
over
and
over
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
many
times
more
.
   
<EOS>
I
now
approach
a
period
of
my
life
,
which
I
can
never
lose
the
remembrance
of
,
while
I
remember
anything
:
and
the
recollection
of
which
has
often
,
without
my
invocation
,
come
before
me
like
a
ghost
,
and
haunted
happier
times
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
been
out
,
one
day
,
loitering
somewhere
,
in
the
listless
,
meditative
manner
that
my
way
of
life
engendered
,
<EOS>
when
,
turning
the
corner
of
a
lane
near
our
house
,
I
came
upon
Mr
Murdstone
walking
with
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
confused
,
and
was
going
by
them
,
when
the
gentleman
cried
:
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
Brooks
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
David
Copperfield
,
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
Brooks
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
Brooks
of
Sheffield
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
your
name
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
these
words
,
I
observed
the
gentleman
more
attentively
.
 
<EOS>
His
laugh
coming
to
my
remembrance
too
,
I
knew
him
to
be
Mr
Quinion
,
whom
I
had
gone
over
to
Lowestoft
with
Mr
Murdstone
to
see
,
before
<EOS>
---
it
is
no
matter
---
I
need
not
recall
when
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
do
you
get
on
,
and
where
are
you
being
educated
,
Brooks
?
"
said
Mr
Quinion
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
put
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
turned
me
about
,
to
walk
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
what
to
reply
,
and
glanced
dubiously
at
Mr
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
at
home
at
present
,
"
said
the
latter
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
being
educated
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
difficult
subject
.
"
   
<EOS>
That
old
,
double
look
was
on
me
for
a
moment
;
and
then
his
eyes
darkened
with
a
frown
,
as
it
turned
,
in
its
aversion
,
elsewhere
.
   
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Quinion
,
looking
at
us
both
,
I
thought
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fine
weather
!
"
   
<EOS>
Silence
ensued
,
and
I
was
considering
how
I
could
best
disengage
my
shoulder
from
his
hand
,
and
go
away
,
when
he
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
are
a
pretty
sharp
fellow
still
?
 
<EOS>
Eh
,
Brooks
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
 
<EOS>
He
is
sharp
enough
,
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
,
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
let
him
go
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
not
thank
you
for
troubling
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
On
this
hint
,
Mr
Quinion
released
me
,
and
I
made
the
best
of
my
way
home
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
back
as
I
turned
into
the
front
garden
,
I
saw
Mr
Murdstone
leaning
against
the
wicket
of
the
churchyard
,
and
Mr
Quinion
talking
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
both
looking
after
me
,
and
I
felt
that
they
were
speaking
of
me
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Quinion
lay
at
our
house
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
After
breakfast
,
the
next
morning
,
I
had
put
my
chair
away
,
and
was
going
out
of
the
room
,
when
Mr
Murdstone
called
me
back
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
gravely
repaired
to
another
table
,
where
his
sister
sat
herself
at
her
desk
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Quinion
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
stood
looking
out
of
window
;
and
I
stood
looking
at
them
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
David
,
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
,
"
to
the
young
<EOS>
this
is
a
world
for
action
;
not
for
moping
and
droning
in
.
<EOS>
"
   
---
"
As
you
do
,
"
added
his
sister
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jane
Murdstone
,
leave
it
to
me
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
David
,
to
the
young
<EOS>
this
is
a
world
for
action
,
and
not
for
moping
and
droning
in
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
especially
so
for
a
young
boy
of
your
disposition
,
which
requires
a
great
deal
of
correcting
;
and
to
which
no
greater
service
can
be
done
than
to
force
it
to
conform
to
the
ways
of
the
working
world
,
and
to
bend
it
and
break
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
stubbornness
wo
n't
do
here
,
"
said
his
sister
"
<EOS>
What
it
wants
is
,
to
be
crushed
.
 
<EOS>
And
crushed
it
must
be
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
be
,
too
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
gave
her
a
look
,
half
in
remonstrance
,
half
in
approval
,
and
went
on
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
know
,
David
,
that
I
am
not
rich
.
 
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
you
know
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
received
some
considerable
education
already
.
 
<EOS>
Education
is
costly
;
and
even
if
it
were
not
,
and
I
could
afford
it
,
I
am
of
opinion
that
it
would
not
be
at
all
advantageous
to
you
to
be
kept
at
school
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
before
you
,
is
a
fight
with
the
world
;
and
the
sooner
you
begin
it
,
the
better
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
think
it
occurred
to
me
that
I
had
already
begun
it
,
in
my
poor
way
:
but
it
occurs
to
me
now
,
whether
or
no
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
heard
the
"
counting
-
house
"
mentioned
sometimes
,
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
counting
-
house
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
Of
Murdstone
and
Grinby
,
in
the
wine
trade
,
"
he
replied
.
   
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
looked
uncertain
,
for
he
went
on
hastily
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
heard
the
"
counting
-
house
"
mentioned
,
or
the
business
,
or
the
cellars
,
or
the
wharf
,
or
something
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
heard
the
business
mentioned
,
sir
,
"
I
said
,
remembering
what
I
vaguely
knew
of
his
and
his
sister
's
resources
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
know
when
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
does
not
matter
when
,
"
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Quinion
manages
that
business
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
glanced
at
the
latter
deferentially
as
he
stood
looking
out
of
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Quinion
suggests
that
it
gives
employment
to
some
other
boys
,
and
that
he
sees
no
reason
why
it
should
n't
,
on
the
same
terms
,
give
employment
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
having
,
"
Mr
Quinion
observed
in
a
low
voice
,
and
half
turning
round
,
"
no
other
prospect
,
Murdstone
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Murdstone
,
with
an
impatient
,
even
an
angry
gesture
,
resumed
,
without
noticing
what
he
had
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
Those
terms
are
,
that
you
will
earn
enough
for
yourself
to
provide
for
your
eating
and
drinking
,
and
pocket
-
money
.
 
<EOS>
Your
lodging
(
which
I
have
arranged
for
)
will
be
paid
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
So
will
your
washing
---
"
   
"
---
Which
will
be
kept
down
to
my
estimate
,
"
said
his
sister
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
clothes
will
be
looked
after
for
you
,
too
,
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
;
"
as
you
will
not
be
able
,
yet
awhile
,
to
get
them
for
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
are
now
going
to
London
,
David
,
with
Mr
Quinion
,
to
begin
the
world
on
your
own
account
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
you
are
provided
for
,
"
observed
his
sister
;
"
and
will
please
to
do
your
duty
.
"
   
<EOS>
Though
I
quite
understood
that
the
purpose
of
this
announcement
was
to
get
rid
of
me
,
I
have
no
distinct
remembrance
whether
it
pleased
or
frightened
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
impression
is
,
that
I
was
in
a
state
of
confusion
about
it
,
and
,
oscillating
between
the
two
points
,
touched
neither
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
had
I
much
time
for
the
clearing
of
my
thoughts
,
as
Mr
Quinion
was
to
go
upon
the
morrow
.
   
<EOS>
Behold
me
,
on
the
morrow
,
in
a
much
-
worn
little
white
hat
,
with
a
black
crape
round
it
for
my
mother
,
a
black
jacket
,
and
a
pair
of
hard
,
stiff
corduroy
trousers
---
which
Miss
Murdstone
considered
the
best
armour
for
the
legs
in
that
fight
with
the
world
which
was
now
to
come
off
.
 
<EOS>
behold
me
so
attired
,
and
with
my
little
worldly
all
before
me
in
a
small
trunk
,
sitting
,
a
lone
lorn
child
(
as
Mrs
Gummidge
might
have
said
)
,
in
the
post
-
chaise
that
was
carrying
Mr
Quinion
to
the
London
coach
at
Yarmouth
!
 
<EOS>
See
,
how
our
house
and
church
are
lessening
in
the
distance
;
how
the
grave
beneath
the
tree
is
blotted
out
by
intervening
objects
;
how
the
spire
points
upwards
from
my
old
playground
no
more
,
and
the
sky
is
empty
!
      
<EOS>
Chapter
11
.
<EOS>
I
begin
life
on
my
own
account
,
and
do
n't
like
it
 
<EOS>
I
know
enough
of
the
world
now
,
to
have
almost
lost
the
capacity
of
being
much
surprised
by
anything
;
but
it
is
matter
of
some
surprise
to
me
,
even
now
,
that
I
can
have
been
so
easily
thrown
away
at
such
an
age
.
 
<EOS>
A
child
of
excellent
abilities
,
and
with
strong
powers
of
observation
,
quick
,
eager
,
delicate
,
and
soon
hurt
bodily
or
mentally
<EOS>
,
it
seems
wonderful
to
me
that
nobody
should
have
made
any
sign
in
my
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
But
none
was
made
;
and
I
became
,
at
ten
years
old
,
a
little
labouring
hind
in
the
service
of
Murdstone
and
Grinby
.
   
<EOS>
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
warehouse
was
at
the
waterside
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
down
in
Blackfriars
.
 
<EOS>
Modern
improvements
have
altered
the
place
;
but
it
was
the
last
house
at
the
bottom
of
a
narrow
street
,
curving
down
hill
to
the
river
,
with
some
stairs
at
the
end
,
where
people
took
boat
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
crazy
old
house
with
a
wharf
of
its
own
,
abutting
on
the
water
when
the
tide
was
in
,
and
on
the
mud
when
the
tide
was
out
,
and
literally
overrun
with
rats
.
 
<EOS>
Its
panelled
rooms
,
discoloured
with
the
dirt
and
smoke
of
a
hundred
years
,
I
dare
say
;
its
decaying
floors
and
staircase
;
the
squeaking
and
scuffling
of
the
old
grey
rats
down
in
the
cellars
;
and
the
dirt
and
rottenness
of
the
place
;
are
things
,
not
of
many
years
ago
,
in
my
mind
,
but
of
the
present
instant
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
all
before
me
,
just
as
they
were
in
the
evil
hour
when
I
went
among
them
for
the
first
time
,
with
my
trembling
hand
in
Mr
Quinion
's
.
   
<EOS>
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
trade
was
among
a
good
many
kinds
of
people
,
but
an
important
branch
of
it
was
the
supply
of
wines
and
spirits
to
certain
packet
ships
.
 
<EOS>
I
forget
now
where
they
chiefly
went
,
but
I
think
there
were
some
among
them
that
made
voyages
both
to
the
East
and
West
Indies
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
a
great
many
empty
bottles
were
one
of
the
consequences
of
this
traffic
,
and
that
certain
men
and
boys
were
employed
to
examine
them
against
the
light
,
and
reject
those
that
were
flawed
,
and
to
rinse
and
wash
them
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
empty
bottles
ran
short
,
there
were
labels
to
be
pasted
on
full
ones
,
or
corks
to
be
fitted
to
them
,
or
seals
to
be
put
upon
the
corks
,
or
finished
bottles
to
be
packed
in
casks
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
work
was
my
work
,
and
of
the
boys
employed
upon
it
I
was
one
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
three
or
four
of
us
,
counting
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
working
place
was
established
in
a
corner
of
the
warehouse
,
where
Mr
Quinion
could
see
me
,
when
he
chose
to
stand
up
on
the
bottom
rail
of
his
stool
in
the
counting
-
house
,
and
look
at
me
through
a
window
above
the
desk
.
 
<EOS>
Hither
,
on
the
first
morning
of
my
so
auspiciously
beginning
life
on
my
own
account
,
the
oldest
of
the
regular
boys
was
summoned
to
show
me
my
business
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
was
Mick
Walker
,
and
he
wore
a
ragged
apron
and
a
paper
cap
.
 
<EOS>
He
informed
me
that
his
father
was
a
bargeman
,
and
walked
,
in
a
black
velvet
head
-
dress
,
in
the
Lord
Mayor
's
Show
.
 
<EOS>
He
also
informed
me
that
our
principal
associate
would
be
another
boy
whom
he
introduced
by
the
---
to
me
---
extraordinary
name
of
Mealy
Potatoes
.
 
<EOS>
I
discovered
,
however
,
that
this
youth
had
not
been
christened
by
that
name
,
but
that
it
had
been
bestowed
upon
him
in
the
warehouse
,
on
account
of
his
complexion
,
which
was
pale
or
mealy
.
 
<EOS>
Mealy
's
father
was
a
waterman
,
who
had
the
additional
distinction
of
being
a
fireman
,
and
was
engaged
as
such
at
one
of
the
large
theatres
;
where
some
young
relation
of
Mealy
's
---
I
think
his
little
sister
---
did
Imps
in
the
Pantomimes
.
   
<EOS>
No
words
can
express
the
secret
agony
of
my
soul
as
I
sunk
into
this
companionship
;
compared
these
henceforth
everyday
associates
with
those
of
my
happier
childhood
---
not
to
say
with
Steerforth
,
Traddles
,
and
the
rest
of
those
boys
;
and
felt
my
hopes
of
growing
up
to
be
a
learned
and
distinguished
man
,
crushed
in
my
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
The
deep
remembrance
of
the
sense
I
had
,
of
being
utterly
without
hope
now
;
of
the
shame
I
felt
in
my
position
;
of
the
misery
it
was
to
my
young
heart
to
believe
that
day
by
day
what
I
had
learned
,
and
thought
,
and
delighted
in
,
and
raised
my
fancy
and
my
emulation
up
by
,
would
pass
away
from
me
,
little
by
little
,
never
to
be
brought
back
any
more
;
can
not
be
written
.
 
<EOS>
As
often
as
Mick
Walker
went
away
in
the
course
of
that
forenoon
,
I
mingled
my
tears
with
the
water
in
which
I
was
washing
the
bottles
;
and
sobbed
as
if
there
were
a
flaw
in
my
own
breast
,
and
it
were
in
danger
of
bursting
.
   
<EOS>
The
counting
-
house
clock
was
at
half
past
twelve
,
and
there
was
general
preparation
for
going
to
dinner
,
when
Mr
Quinion
tapped
at
the
counting
-
house
window
,
and
beckoned
to
me
to
go
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
in
,
and
found
there
a
stoutish
,
middle
-
aged
person
,
in
a
brown
surtout
and
black
tights
and
shoes
,
with
no
more
hair
upon
his
head
(
which
was
a
large
one
,
and
very
shining
)
than
there
is
upon
an
egg
,
and
with
a
very
extensive
face
,
which
he
turned
full
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
His
clothes
were
shabby
,
but
he
had
an
imposing
shirt
-
collar
on
.
 
<EOS>
He
carried
a
jaunty
sort
of
a
stick
,
with
a
large
pair
of
rusty
tassels
to
it
;
and
a
quizzing
-
glass
hung
outside
his
coat
,
---
for
ornament
,
I
afterwards
found
,
as
he
very
seldom
looked
through
it
,
and
could
n't
see
anything
when
he
did
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
said
Mr
Quinion
,
in
allusion
to
myself
,
"
is
he
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
with
a
certain
condescending
roll
in
his
voice
,
and
a
certain
indescribable
air
of
doing
something
genteel
,
which
impressed
me
very
much
,
"
is
Master
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
see
you
well
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
said
I
was
very
well
,
and
hoped
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
sufficiently
ill
at
ease
,
Heaven
knows
;
but
it
was
not
in
my
nature
to
complain
much
at
that
time
of
my
life
,
so
<EOS>
I
said
I
was
very
well
,
and
hoped
he
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
"
thank
Heaven
,
quite
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
received
a
letter
from
Mr
Murdstone
,
in
which
he
mentions
that
he
would
desire
me
to
receive
into
an
apartment
in
the
rear
of
my
house
,
which
is
at
present
unoccupied
---
and
is
,
in
short
,
to
be
let
as
a
---
in
short

"
said
the
stranger
,
with
a
smile
and
in
a
burst
of
confidence
,
"
as
a
bedroom
---
the
young
beginner
whom
I
have
now
the
pleasure
to
---
"
and
the
stranger
waved
his
hand
,
and
settled
his
chin
in
his
shirt
-
collar
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
Mr
Micawber
,
"
said
Mr
Quinion
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ahem
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
stranger
,
"
that
is
my
name
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Micawber
,
"
said
Mr
Quinion
,
"
is
known
to
Mr
Murdstone
.
 
<EOS>
He
takes
orders
for
us
on
commission
,
when
he
can
get
any
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
written
to
by
Mr
Murdstone
,
on
the
subject
of
your
lodgings
,
and
he
will
receive
you
as
a
lodger
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
address
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
is
Windsor
Terrace
,
City
Road
.
<EOS>
I
---
in
short
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
with
the
same
genteel
air
,
and
in
another
burst
of
confidence
---
"
I
live
there
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
made
him
a
bow
.
   
<EOS>
"
Under
the
impression
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
that
your
peregrinations
in
this
metropolis
have
not
as
yet
been
extensive
,
and
that
you
might
have
some
difficulty
in
penetrating
the
arcana
of
the
Modern
Babylon
in
the
direction
of
the
City
Road
,
---
in
short
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
in
another
burst
of
confidence
,
"
that
you
might
lose
yourself
<EOS>
---
I
shall
be
happy
to
call
this
evening
,
and
install
you
in
the
knowledge
of
the
nearest
way
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
thanked
him
with
all
my
heart
,
for
it
was
friendly
in
him
to
offer
to
take
that
trouble
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
what
hour
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
shall
I
---
"
   
"
At
about
eight
,
"
said
Mr
Quinion
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
about
eight
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
to
wish
you
good
day
,
Mr
Quinion
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
intrude
no
longer
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
he
put
on
his
hat
,
and
went
out
with
his
cane
under
his
arm
:
very
upright
,
and
humming
a
tune
when
he
was
clear
of
the
counting
-
house
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Quinion
then
formally
engaged
me
to
be
as
useful
as
I
could
in
the
warehouse
of
Murdstone
and
Grinby
,
at
a
salary
,
I
think
,
of
six
shillings
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
clear
whether
it
was
six
or
seven
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
inclined
to
believe
,
from
my
uncertainty
on
this
head
,
<EOS>
that
it
was
six
at
first
and
seven
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
paid
me
a
week
down
(
from
his
own
pocket
,
I
believe
)
,
and
I
gave
Mealy
sixpence
out
of
it
to
get
my
trunk
carried
to
Windsor
Terrace
that
night
:
it
being
too
heavy
for
my
strength
,
small
as
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
paid
sixpence
more
for
my
dinner
,
which
was
a
meat
pie
and
a
turn
at
a
neighbouring
pump
;
and
passed
the
hour
which
was
allowed
for
that
meal
,
in
walking
about
the
streets
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
appointed
time
in
the
evening
,
Mr
Micawber
reappeared
.
 
<EOS>
I
washed
my
hands
and
face
,
to
do
the
greater
honour
to
his
gentility
,
and
we
walked
to
our
house
,
as
I
suppose
I
must
now
call
it
,
together
;
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
impressing
the
name
of
streets
,
and
the
shapes
of
corner
houses
upon
me
,
as
we
went
along
,
that
I
might
find
my
way
back
,
easily
,
in
the
morning
.
   
<EOS>
Arrived
at
this
house
in
Windsor
Terrace
(
which
I
noticed
was
shabby
like
himself
,
but
also
,
like
himself
,
made
all
the
show
it
could
)
<EOS>
,
he
presented
me
to
Mrs
Micawber
,
a
thin
and
faded
lady
,
not
at
all
young
,
who
was
sitting
in
the
parlour
(
the
first
floor
was
altogether
unfurnished
,
and
the
blinds
were
kept
down
to
delude
the
neighbours
)
,
with
a
baby
at
her
breast
.
 
<EOS>
This
baby
was
one
of
twins
;
and
I
may
remark
here
that
I
hardly
ever
,
in
all
my
experience
of
the
family
,
saw
both
the
twins
detached
from
Mrs
Micawber
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
them
was
always
taking
refreshment
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
two
other
children
;
Master
Micawber
,
aged
about
four
,
and
Miss
Micawber
,
aged
about
three
.
 
<EOS>
These
,
and
a
dark
-
complexioned
young
woman
,
with
a
habit
of
snorting
,
who
was
servant
to
the
family
,
and
informed
me
,
before
half
an
hour
had
expired
,
that
she
was
"
a
Orfling
"
,
and
came
from
St
Luke
's
workhouse
,
in
the
neighbourhood
,
completed
the
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
My
room
was
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
at
the
back
:
a
close
chamber
;
stencilled
all
over
with
an
ornament
which
my
young
imagination
represented
as
a
blue
muffin
;
and
very
scantily
furnished
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
thought
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
when
she
came
up
,
twin
and
all
,
to
show
me
the
apartment
,
and
sat
down
to
take
breath
,
"
before
I
was
married
,
<EOS>
when
I
lived
with
papa
and
mama
,
that
I
should
ever
find
it
necessary
to
take
a
lodger
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Micawber
being
in
difficulties
,
all
considerations
of
private
feeling
must
give
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
said
:
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Micawber
's
difficulties
are
almost
overwhelming
just
at
present
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
;
"
and
whether
it
is
possible
to
bring
him
through
them
,
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
lived
at
home
with
papa
and
mama
,
I
really
should
have
hardly
understood
what
the
word
meant
,
in
the
sense
in
which
I
now
employ
it
,
but
experientia
does
it
,
---
as
papa
used
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
can
not
satisfy
myself
whether
she
told
me
that
Mr
Micawber
had
been
an
officer
in
the
Marines
,
or
whether
I
have
imagined
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
know
that
I
believe
to
this
hour
that
he
WAS
in
the
Marines
once
upon
a
time
,
without
knowing
why
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
sort
of
town
traveller
for
a
number
of
miscellaneous
houses
,
now
;
but
made
little
or
nothing
of
it
,
I
am
afraid
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
Mr
Micawber
's
creditors
will
not
give
him
time
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
they
must
take
the
consequences
;
and
the
sooner
they
bring
it
to
an
issue
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
Blood
can
not
be
obtained
from
a
stone
,
neither
can
anything
on
account
be
obtained
at
present
(
not
to
mention
law
expenses
)
from
Mr
Micawber
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
never
can
quite
understand
whether
my
precocious
self
-
dependence
confused
Mrs
Micawber
in
reference
to
my
age
,
or
whether
she
was
so
full
of
the
subject
that
she
would
have
talked
about
it
to
the
very
twins
if
there
had
been
nobody
else
to
communicate
with
,
but
this
was
the
strain
in
which
she
began
,
and
she
went
on
accordingly
all
the
time
I
knew
her
.
   
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs
Micawber
!
 
<EOS>
She
said
she
had
tried
to
exert
herself
,
and
so
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
she
had
.
 
<EOS>
The
centre
of
the
street
door
was
perfectly
covered
with
a
great
brass
-
plate
,
on
which
was
engraved
"
Mrs
Micawber
's
Boarding
Establishment
for
Young
Ladies
"
:
<EOS>
but
I
never
found
that
any
young
lady
had
ever
been
to
school
there
;
or
that
any
young
lady
ever
came
,
or
proposed
to
come
;
or
that
the
least
preparation
was
ever
made
to
receive
any
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
visitors
I
ever
saw
,
or
heard
of
,
were
creditors
.
 
<EOS>
THEY
used
to
come
at
all
hours
,
and
some
of
them
were
quite
ferocious
.
 
<EOS>
One
dirty
-
faced
man
<EOS>
,
I
think
he
was
a
boot
-
maker
,
used
to
edge
himself
into
the
passage
as
early
as
seven
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
call
up
the
stairs
to
Mr
Micawber
---
"
Come
!
 
<EOS>
You
ai
n't
out
yet
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Pay
us
,
will
you
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
hide
,
you
know
;
that
's
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
be
mean
if
I
was
you
.
 
<EOS>
Pay
us
,
will
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
just
pay
us
,
d'ye
hear
?
 
<EOS>
Come
!
"
 
<EOS>
Receiving
no
answer
to
these
taunts
,
he
would
mount
in
his
wrath
to
the
words
"
swindlers
"
and
"
robbers
"
;
and
these
being
ineffectual
too
,
would
sometimes
go
to
the
extremity
of
crossing
the
street
,
and
roaring
up
at
the
windows
of
the
second
floor
,
where
he
knew
Mr
Micawber
was
.
 
<EOS>
At
these
times
,
Mr
Micawber
would
be
transported
with
grief
and
mortification
,
even
to
the
length
(
as
I
was
once
made
aware
by
a
scream
from
his
wife
)
of
making
motions
at
himself
with
a
razor
;
but
within
half
-
an
-
hour
afterwards
,
he
would
polish
up
his
shoes
with
extraordinary
pains
,
and
go
out
,
humming
a
tune
with
a
greater
air
of
gentility
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
was
quite
as
elastic
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
known
her
to
be
thrown
into
fainting
fits
by
the
king
's
taxes
at
three
o'clock
,
and
to
eat
lamb
chops
,
breaded
,
and
drink
warm
ale
(
paid
for
with
two
tea
-
spoons
that
had
gone
to
the
pawnbroker
's
)
at
four
.
 
<EOS>
On
one
occasion
,
when
an
execution
had
just
been
put
in
,
coming
home
through
some
chance
as
early
as
six
o'clock
,
I
saw
her
lying
(
of
course
with
a
twin
)
under
the
grate
in
a
swoon
,
with
her
hair
all
torn
about
her
face
;
but
I
never
knew
her
more
cheerful
than
she
was
,
that
very
same
night
,
over
a
veal
cutlet
before
the
kitchen
fire
,
telling
me
stories
about
her
papa
and
mama
,
and
the
company
they
used
to
keep
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
house
,
and
with
this
family
,
I
passed
my
leisure
time
.
 
<EOS>
My
own
exclusive
breakfast
of
a
penny
loaf
and
a
pennyworth
of
milk
<EOS>
,
I
provided
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
kept
another
small
loaf
,
and
a
modicum
of
cheese
,
on
a
particular
shelf
of
a
particular
cupboard
,
to
make
my
supper
on
when
I
came
back
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
This
made
a
hole
in
the
six
or
seven
shillings
,
I
know
well
;
and
I
was
out
at
the
warehouse
all
day
,
and
had
to
support
myself
on
that
money
all
the
week
.
 
<EOS>
From
Monday
morning
until
Saturday
night
,
I
had
no
advice
,
no
counsel
,
no
encouragement
,
no
consolation
,
no
assistance
,
no
support
,
of
any
kind
,
from
anyone
,
that
I
can
call
to
mind
,
as
I
hope
to
go
to
heaven
!
   
<EOS>
I
was
so
young
and
childish
,
and
so
little
qualified
<EOS>
---
how
could
I
be
otherwise
?
---
to
undertake
the
whole
charge
of
my
own
existence
,
that
often
,
in
going
to
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
,
of
a
morning
,
I
could
not
resist
the
stale
pastry
put
out
for
sale
at
half
-
price
at
the
pastrycooks
'
doors
,
and
spent
in
that
the
money
I
should
have
kept
for
my
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
I
went
without
my
dinner
,
or
bought
a
roll
or
a
slice
of
pudding
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
two
pudding
shops
,
between
which
I
was
divided
,
according
to
my
finances
.
 
<EOS>
One
was
in
a
court
close
to
St
Martin
's
Church
---
at
the
back
of
the
church
,
---
which
is
now
removed
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
The
pudding
at
that
shop
was
made
of
currants
,
and
was
rather
a
special
pudding
,
but
was
dear
,
twopennyworth
not
being
larger
than
a
pennyworth
of
more
ordinary
pudding
.
 
<EOS>
A
good
shop
for
the
latter
was
in
the
Strand
---
somewhere
in
that
part
which
has
been
rebuilt
since
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
stout
pale
pudding
,
heavy
and
flabby
,
and
with
great
flat
raisins
in
it
,
stuck
in
whole
at
wide
distances
apart
.
 
<EOS>
It
came
up
hot
at
about
my
time
every
day
,
and
many
a
day
did
I
dine
off
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
dined
regularly
and
handsomely
,
I
had
a
saveloy
and
a
penny
loaf
,
or
a
fourpenny
plate
of
red
beef
from
a
cook
's
shop
;
or
a
plate
of
bread
and
cheese
and
a
glass
of
beer
,
from
a
miserable
old
public
-
house
opposite
our
place
of
business
,
called
the
Lion
,
or
the
Lion
and
something
else
that
I
have
forgotten
.
 
<EOS>
Once
,
I
remember
carrying
my
own
bread
(
which
I
had
brought
from
home
in
the
morning
)
under
my
arm
,
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
paper
,
like
a
book
,
and
going
to
a
famous
alamode
beef
-
house
near
Drury
Lane
,
and
ordering
a
"
small
plate
"
of
that
delicacy
to
eat
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
the
waiter
thought
of
such
a
strange
little
apparition
coming
in
all
alone
,
I
do
n't
know
;
but
I
can
see
him
now
,
staring
at
me
as
I
ate
my
dinner
,
and
bringing
up
the
other
waiter
to
look
.
 
<EOS>
I
gave
him
a
halfpenny
for
himself
,
and
I
wish
he
had
n't
taken
it
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
half
-
an
-
hour
,
I
think
,
for
tea
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
had
money
enough
,
I
used
to
get
half
-
a
-
pint
of
ready
-
made
coffee
and
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
had
none
,
I
used
to
look
at
a
venison
shop
in
Fleet
Street
;
or
I
have
strolled
,
at
such
a
time
,
as
far
as
Covent
Garden
Market
,
and
stared
at
the
pineapples
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
fond
of
wandering
about
the
Adelphi
,
because
it
was
a
mysterious
place
,
with
those
dark
arches
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
myself
emerging
one
evening
from
some
of
these
arches
,
on
a
little
public
-
house
close
to
the
river
,
with
an
open
space
before
it
,
where
some
coal
-
heavers
were
dancing
;
to
look
at
whom
I
sat
down
upon
a
bench
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
they
thought
of
me
!
   
<EOS>
I
was
such
a
child
,
and
so
little
,
that
frequently
when
I
went
into
the
bar
of
a
strange
public
-
house
for
a
glass
of
ale
or
porter
,
to
moisten
what
I
had
had
for
dinner
,
they
were
afraid
to
give
it
me
.
<EOS>
I
remember
one
hot
evening
<EOS>
I
went
into
the
bar
of
a
public
-
house
,
and
said
to
the
landlord
:
"
What
is
your
best
---
your
very
best
---
ale
a
glass
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
For
it
was
a
special
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
been
my
birthday
.
   
<EOS>
"
Twopence
-
halfpenny
,
"
says
the
landlord
,
"
is
the
price
of
the
Genuine
Stunning
ale
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
says
I
,
producing
the
money
,
"
just
draw
me
a
glass
of
the
Genuine
Stunning
,
if
you
please
,
with
a
good
head
to
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
landlord
looked
at
me
in
return
over
the
bar
,
from
head
to
foot
,
with
a
strange
smile
on
his
face
;
and
instead
of
drawing
the
beer
,
looked
round
the
screen
and
said
something
to
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
She
came
out
from
behind
it
,
with
her
work
in
her
hand
,
and
joined
him
in
surveying
me
.
 
<EOS>
Here
we
stand
,
all
three
,
before
me
now
.
 
<EOS>
The
landlord
in
his
shirt
-
sleeves
,
leaning
against
the
bar
window
-
frame
;
his
wife
looking
over
the
little
half
-
door
;
and
I
,
in
some
confusion
,
looking
up
at
them
from
outside
the
partition
.
<EOS>
They
asked
me
a
good
many
questions
;
as
,
what
my
name
was
,
<EOS>
how
old
I
was
,
where
I
lived
,
how
I
was
employed
,
and
how
I
came
there
.
 
<EOS>
To
all
of
which
,
that
I
might
commit
nobody
<EOS>
,
I
invented
,
I
am
afraid
,
appropriate
answers
.
 
<EOS>
They
served
me
with
the
ale
,
though
I
suspect
it
was
not
the
Genuine
Stunning
;
and
the
landlord
's
wife
,
opening
the
little
half
-
door
of
the
bar
,
and
bending
down
,
gave
me
my
money
back
,
and
gave
me
a
kiss
that
was
half
admiring
and
half
compassionate
,
but
all
womanly
and
good
,
I
am
sure
.
   
<EOS>
I
know
I
do
not
exaggerate
,
unconsciously
and
unintentionally
,
<EOS>
the
scantiness
of
my
resources
or
the
difficulties
of
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
if
a
shilling
were
given
me
by
Mr
Quinion
at
any
time
,
I
spent
it
in
a
dinner
or
a
tea
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
worked
,
from
morning
until
night
,
with
common
men
and
boys
,
a
shabby
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
lounged
about
the
streets
,
insufficiently
and
unsatisfactorily
fed
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
,
but
for
the
mercy
of
God
,
I
might
easily
have
been
,
for
any
care
that
was
taken
of
me
,
a
little
robber
or
a
little
vagabond
.
   
<EOS>
Yet
I
held
some
station
at
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
too
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
that
Mr
Quinion
did
what
a
careless
man
so
occupied
,
and
dealing
with
a
thing
so
anomalous
,
could
,
to
treat
me
as
one
upon
a
different
footing
from
the
rest
,
I
never
said
,
to
man
or
boy
,
how
it
was
that
I
came
to
be
there
,
or
gave
the
least
indication
of
being
sorry
that
I
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
suffered
in
secret
,
and
that
I
suffered
exquisitely
,
no
one
ever
knew
but
I.
 
How
much
I
suffered
,
it
is
,
as
I
have
said
already
,
utterly
beyond
my
power
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
kept
my
own
counsel
,
and
I
did
my
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
from
the
first
,
that
,
if
I
could
not
do
my
work
as
well
as
any
of
the
rest
,
I
could
not
hold
myself
above
slight
and
contempt
.
 
<EOS>
I
soon
became
at
least
as
expeditious
and
as
skilful
as
either
of
the
other
boys
.
 
<EOS>
Though
perfectly
familiar
with
them
,
my
conduct
and
manner
were
different
enough
from
theirs
to
place
a
space
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
They
and
the
men
generally
spoke
of
me
as
"
the
little
gent
"
,
or
"
the
young
Suffolker
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
certain
man
named
Gregory
,
who
was
foreman
of
the
packers
,
and
another
named
Tipp
,
who
was
the
carman
,
and
wore
a
red
jacket
,
used
to
address
me
sometimes
as
"
David
"
:
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
was
mostly
when
we
were
very
confidential
,
and
when
I
had
made
some
efforts
to
entertain
them
,
over
our
work
,
with
some
results
of
the
old
readings
;
which
were
fast
perishing
out
of
my
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
Mealy
Potatoes
uprose
once
,
and
rebelled
against
my
being
so
distinguished
;
but
Mick
Walker
settled
him
in
no
time
.
   
<EOS>
My
rescue
from
this
kind
of
existence
<EOS>
I
considered
quite
hopeless
,
and
abandoned
,
as
such
,
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
solemnly
convinced
that
I
never
for
one
hour
was
reconciled
to
it
,
or
was
otherwise
than
miserably
unhappy
;
but
I
bore
it
;
and
even
to
Peggotty
,
partly
for
the
love
of
her
and
partly
for
shame
,
never
in
any
letter
(
though
many
passed
between
us
)
revealed
the
truth
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
's
difficulties
were
an
addition
to
the
distressed
state
of
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
In
my
forlorn
state
I
became
quite
attached
to
the
family
,
and
used
to
walk
about
,
busy
with
Mrs
Micawber
's
calculations
of
ways
and
means
,
and
heavy
with
the
weight
of
Mr
Micawber
's
debts
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
Saturday
night
,
which
was
my
grand
treat
,
---
partly
because
it
was
a
great
thing
to
walk
home
with
six
or
seven
shillings
in
my
pocket
,
looking
into
the
shops
and
thinking
what
such
a
sum
would
buy
,
and
partly
because
I
went
home
early
,
---
Mrs
Micawber
would
make
the
most
heart
-
rending
confidences
to
me
;
also
on
a
Sunday
morning
,
when
I
mixed
the
portion
of
tea
or
coffee
I
had
bought
over
-
night
,
in
a
little
shaving
-
pot
,
and
sat
late
at
my
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
nothing
at
all
unusual
for
Mr
Micawber
to
sob
violently
at
the
beginning
of
one
of
these
Saturday
night
conversations
,
and
sing
about
jack
's
delight
being
his
lovely
Nan
,
towards
the
end
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
known
him
come
home
to
supper
with
a
flood
of
tears
,
and
a
declaration
that
nothing
was
now
left
but
a
jail
;
and
go
to
bed
making
a
calculation
of
the
expense
of
putting
bow
-
windows
to
the
house
,
"
in
case
anything
turned
up
"
,
which
was
his
favourite
expression
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mrs
Micawber
was
just
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
A
curious
equality
of
friendship
,
originating
,
I
suppose
,
in
our
respective
circumstances
,
sprung
up
between
me
and
these
people
,
notwithstanding
the
ludicrous
disparity
in
our
years
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
never
allowed
myself
to
be
prevailed
upon
to
accept
any
invitation
to
eat
and
drink
with
them
out
of
their
stock
(
knowing
that
they
got
on
badly
with
the
butcher
and
baker
,
and
had
often
not
too
much
for
themselves
)
,
until
Mrs
Micawber
took
me
into
her
entire
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
This
<EOS>
she
did
one
evening
as
follows
:
   
<EOS>
"
Master
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
I
make
no
stranger
of
you
,
and
therefore
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
Mr
Micawber
's
difficulties
are
coming
to
a
crisis
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
made
me
very
miserable
to
hear
it
,
and
I
looked
at
Mrs
Micawber
's
red
eyes
with
the
utmost
sympathy
.
   
<EOS>
"
With
the
exception
of
the
heel
of
a
Dutch
cheese
---
which
is
not
adapted
to
the
wants
of
a
young
family
"
---
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
there
is
really
not
a
scrap
of
anything
in
the
larder
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
accustomed
to
speak
of
the
larder
when
I
lived
with
papa
and
mama
,
and
I
use
the
word
almost
unconsciously
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
mean
to
express
is
,
that
there
is
nothing
to
eat
in
the
house
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
said
,
in
great
concern
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
two
or
three
shillings
of
my
week
's
money
in
my
pocket
---
<EOS>
from
which
I
presume
that
it
must
have
been
on
a
Wednesday
night
when
we
held
this
conversation
---
and
I
hastily
produced
them
,
and
with
heartfelt
emotion
begged
Mrs
Micawber
to
accept
of
them
as
a
loan
.
<EOS>
But
that
lady
,
kissing
me
,
and
making
me
put
them
back
in
my
pocket
,
replied
that
she
could
n't
think
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
my
dear
Master
Copperfield
,
"
said
she
,
"
far
be
it
from
my
thoughts
!
 
<EOS>
But
you
have
a
discretion
beyond
your
years
,
and
can
render
me
another
kind
of
service
,
if
you
will
;
and
a
service
I
will
thankfully
accept
of
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
begged
Mrs
Micawber
to
name
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
parted
with
the
plate
myself
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
Six
tea
,
two
salt
,
and
a
pair
of
sugars
,
I
have
at
different
times
borrowed
money
on
,
in
secret
,
with
my
own
hands
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
twins
are
a
great
tie
;
and
to
me
,
with
my
recollections
,
of
papa
and
mama
,
these
transactions
are
very
painful
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
still
a
few
trifles
that
we
could
part
with
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
's
feelings
would
never
allow
him
to
dispose
of
them
;
and
Clickett
"
---
this
was
the
girl
from
the
workhouse
---
"
being
of
a
vulgar
mind
,
would
take
painful
liberties
if
so
much
confidence
was
reposed
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
Master
Copperfield
,
if
I
might
ask
you
---
"
   
I
understood
Mrs
Micawber
now
,
and
begged
her
to
make
use
of
me
to
any
extent
.
 
<EOS>
I
began
to
dispose
of
the
more
portable
articles
of
property
that
very
evening
;
and
went
out
on
a
similar
expedition
almost
every
morning
,
before
I
went
to
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
had
a
few
books
on
a
little
chiffonier
,
which
he
called
the
library
;
and
those
went
first
.
 
<EOS>
I
carried
them
,
one
after
another
,
to
a
bookstall
in
the
City
Road
---
<EOS>
one
part
of
which
,
near
our
house
,
was
almost
all
bookstalls
and
bird
shops
then
---
and
sold
them
for
whatever
they
would
bring
.
 
<EOS>
The
keeper
of
this
bookstall
,
who
lived
in
a
little
house
behind
it
,
used
to
get
tipsy
every
night
,
and
to
be
violently
scolded
by
his
wife
every
morning
.
<EOS>
More
than
once
,
when
I
went
there
early
,
I
had
audience
of
him
in
a
turn
-
up
bedstead
,
with
a
cut
in
his
forehead
or
a
black
eye
,
bearing
witness
to
his
excesses
over
-
night
<EOS>
(
I
am
afraid
he
was
quarrelsome
in
his
drink
)
,
and
he
,
with
a
shaking
hand
,
endeavouring
to
find
the
needful
shillings
in
one
or
other
of
the
pockets
of
his
clothes
,
which
lay
upon
the
floor
,
while
his
wife
,
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
and
her
shoes
down
at
heel
,
never
left
off
rating
him
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
had
lost
his
money
,
and
then
he
would
ask
me
to
call
again
;
but
his
wife
had
always
got
some
---
had
taken
his
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
while
he
was
drunk
---
and
secretly
completed
the
bargain
on
the
stairs
,
as
we
went
down
together
.
<EOS>
At
the
pawnbroker
's
shop
,
too
,
I
began
to
be
very
well
known
.
 
<EOS>
The
principal
gentleman
who
officiated
behind
the
counter
,
took
a
good
deal
of
notice
of
me
;
and
often
got
me
,
I
recollect
,
to
decline
a
Latin
noun
or
adjective
,
or
to
conjugate
a
Latin
verb
,
in
his
ear
,
while
he
transacted
my
business
.
 
<EOS>
After
all
these
occasions
Mrs
Micawber
made
a
little
treat
,
which
was
generally
a
supper
;
and
there
was
a
peculiar
relish
in
these
meals
which
I
well
remember
.
   
<EOS>
At
last
Mr
Micawber
's
difficulties
came
to
a
crisis
,
and
he
was
arrested
early
one
morning
,
and
carried
over
to
the
King
's
Bench
Prison
in
the
Borough
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
,
as
he
went
out
of
the
house
,
that
the
God
of
day
had
now
gone
down
upon
him
---
and
I
really
thought
his
heart
was
broken
and
mine
too
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
heard
,
afterwards
,
that
he
was
seen
to
play
a
lively
game
at
skittles
,
before
noon
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
first
Sunday
after
he
was
taken
there
,
I
was
to
go
and
see
him
,
and
have
dinner
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
ask
my
way
to
such
a
place
,
and
just
short
of
that
place
<EOS>
I
should
see
such
another
place
,
and
just
short
of
that
I
should
see
a
yard
,
which
I
was
to
cross
,
and
keep
straight
on
until
I
saw
a
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
I
did
;
and
when
at
last
I
did
see
a
turnkey
(
poor
little
fellow
that
I
was
!
)
,
and
thought
how
,
when
Roderick
Random
was
in
a
debtors
'
prison
,
there
was
a
man
there
with
nothing
on
him
but
an
old
rug
,
the
turnkey
swam
before
my
dimmed
eyes
and
my
beating
heart
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
was
waiting
for
me
within
the
gate
,
and
we
went
up
to
his
room
(
top
story
but
one
)
,
and
cried
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
He
solemnly
conjured
me
,
I
remember
,
to
take
warning
by
his
fate
;
and
to
observe
that
if
a
man
had
twenty
pounds
a
-
year
for
his
income
,
and
spent
nineteen
pounds
nineteen
shillings
and
sixpence
,
he
would
be
happy
,
but
that
if
he
spent
twenty
pounds
one
he
would
be
miserable
.
 
<EOS>
After
which
he
borrowed
a
shilling
of
me
for
porter
,
gave
me
a
written
order
on
Mrs
Micawber
for
the
amount
,
and
put
away
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
and
cheered
up
.
   
<EOS>
We
sat
before
a
little
fire
,
with
two
bricks
put
within
the
rusted
grate
,
one
on
each
side
,
to
prevent
its
burning
too
many
coals
;
until
another
debtor
,
who
shared
the
room
with
Mr
Micawber
,
came
in
from
the
bakehouse
with
the
loin
of
mutton
which
was
our
joint
-
stock
repast
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
was
sent
up
to
"
Captain
Hopkins
"
in
the
room
overhead
,
with
Mr
Micawber
's
compliments
,
and
I
was
his
young
friend
,
and
would
Captain
Hopkins
lend
me
a
knife
and
fork
.
   
<EOS>
Captain
Hopkins
lent
me
the
knife
and
fork
,
with
his
compliments
to
Mr
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
very
dirty
lady
in
his
little
room
,
and
two
wan
girls
,
his
daughters
,
with
shock
heads
of
hair
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
better
to
borrow
Captain
Hopkins
's
knife
and
fork
,
than
Captain
Hopkins
's
comb
.
 
<EOS>
The
Captain
himself
was
in
the
last
extremity
of
shabbiness
,
with
large
whiskers
,
and
an
old
,
old
brown
great
-
coat
with
no
other
coat
below
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
his
bed
rolled
up
in
a
corner
;
and
what
plates
and
dishes
and
pots
he
had
,
on
a
shelf
;
and
I
divined
(
God
knows
how
)
that
though
the
two
girls
with
the
shock
heads
of
hair
were
Captain
Hopkins
's
children
,
the
dirty
lady
was
not
married
to
Captain
Hopkins
.
 
<EOS>
My
timid
station
on
his
threshold
was
not
occupied
more
than
a
couple
of
minutes
at
most
;
but
I
came
down
again
with
all
this
in
my
knowledge
,
as
surely
as
the
knife
and
fork
were
in
my
hand
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
something
gipsy
-
like
and
agreeable
in
the
dinner
,
after
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
back
Captain
Hopkins
's
knife
and
fork
early
in
the
afternoon
,
and
went
home
to
comfort
Mrs
Micawber
with
an
account
of
my
visit
.
 
<EOS>
She
fainted
when
she
saw
me
return
,
and
made
a
little
jug
of
egg
-
hot
afterwards
to
console
us
while
we
talked
it
over
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
the
household
furniture
came
to
be
sold
for
the
family
benefit
,
or
who
sold
it
,
except
that
I
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
Sold
it
was
,
however
,
and
carried
away
in
a
van
;
except
the
bed
,
a
few
chairs
,
and
the
kitchen
table
.
 
<EOS>
With
these
possessions
we
encamped
,
as
it
were
,
in
the
two
parlours
of
the
emptied
house
in
Windsor
Terrace
;
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
,
the
children
,
the
Orfling
,
and
myself
;
and
lived
in
those
rooms
night
and
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
idea
for
how
long
,
though
it
seems
to
me
for
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
Mrs
Micawber
resolved
to
move
into
the
prison
,
where
Mr
Micawber
had
now
secured
a
room
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
took
the
key
of
the
house
to
the
landlord
,
who
was
very
glad
to
get
it
;
and
the
beds
were
sent
over
to
the
King
's
Bench
,
except
mine
,
for
which
a
little
room
was
hired
outside
the
walls
in
the
neighbourhood
of
that
Institution
,
very
much
to
my
satisfaction
,
since
the
Micawbers
<EOS>
and
I
had
become
too
used
to
one
another
,
in
our
troubles
,
to
part
.
 
<EOS>
The
Orfling
was
likewise
accommodated
with
an
inexpensive
lodging
in
the
same
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
Mine
was
a
quiet
back
-
garret
with
a
sloping
roof
,
commanding
a
pleasant
prospect
of
a
timberyard
;
and
when
I
took
possession
of
it
,
with
the
reflection
that
Mr
Micawber
's
troubles
had
come
to
a
crisis
at
last
,
I
thought
it
quite
a
paradise
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
time
I
was
working
at
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
in
the
same
common
way
,
and
with
the
same
common
companions
,
and
with
the
same
sense
of
unmerited
degradation
as
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
never
,
happily
for
me
no
doubt
,
made
a
single
acquaintance
,
or
spoke
to
any
of
the
many
boys
whom
I
saw
daily
in
going
to
the
warehouse
,
in
coming
from
it
,
and
in
prowling
about
the
streets
at
meal
-
times
.
 
<EOS>
I
led
the
same
secretly
unhappy
life
;
but
I
led
it
in
the
same
lonely
,
self
-
reliant
manner
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
changes
I
am
conscious
of
are
,
firstly
,
that
I
had
grown
more
shabby
,
and
secondly
,
that
I
was
now
relieved
of
much
of
the
weight
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
's
cares
;
for
some
relatives
or
friends
had
engaged
to
help
them
at
their
present
pass
,
and
they
lived
more
comfortably
in
the
prison
than
they
had
lived
for
a
long
while
out
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
used
to
breakfast
with
them
now
,
in
virtue
of
some
arrangement
,
of
which
I
have
forgotten
the
details
.
 
<EOS>
I
forget
,
too
,
at
what
hour
the
gates
were
opened
in
the
morning
,
admitting
of
my
going
in
;
but
I
know
that
I
was
often
up
at
six
o'clock
,
and
that
my
favourite
lounging
-
place
in
the
interval
was
old
London
Bridge
,
where
I
was
wo
nt
to
sit
in
one
of
the
stone
recesses
,
watching
the
people
going
by
,
or
to
look
over
the
balustrades
at
the
sun
shining
in
the
water
,
and
lighting
up
the
golden
flame
on
the
top
of
the
Monument
.
 
<EOS>
The
Orfling
met
me
here
sometimes
,
to
be
told
some
astonishing
fictions
respecting
the
wharves
and
the
Tower
;
of
which
I
can
say
no
more
than
that
<EOS>
I
hope
I
believed
them
myself
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
evening
I
used
to
go
back
to
the
prison
,
and
walk
up
and
down
the
parade
with
Mr
Micawber
;
or
play
casino
with
Mrs
Micawber
,
and
hear
reminiscences
of
her
papa
and
mama
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
Mr
Murdstone
knew
where
I
was
,
I
am
unable
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
never
told
them
at
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
's
affairs
,
although
past
their
crisis
,
were
very
much
involved
by
reason
of
a
certain
"
Deed
"
,
of
which
I
used
to
hear
a
great
deal
,
and
which
I
suppose
,
now
,
to
have
been
some
former
composition
with
his
creditors
,
though
I
was
so
far
from
being
clear
about
it
then
,
that
I
am
conscious
of
having
confounded
it
with
those
demoniacal
parchments
which
are
held
to
have
,
once
upon
a
time
,
obtained
to
a
great
extent
in
Germany
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
this
document
appeared
to
be
got
out
of
the
way
,
somehow
;
at
all
events
it
ceased
to
be
the
rock
-
ahead
it
had
been
;
and
Mrs
Micawber
informed
me
that
"
her
family
"
had
decided
that
Mr
Micawber
should
apply
for
his
release
under
the
Insolvent
Debtors
Act
,
which
would
set
him
free
,
she
expected
,
in
about
six
weeks
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
then
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
who
was
present
,
"
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
I
shall
,
please
Heaven
,
begin
to
be
beforehand
with
the
world
,
and
to
live
in
a
perfectly
new
manner
,
if
---
in
short
,
if
anything
turns
up
.
"
   
<EOS>
By
way
of
going
in
for
anything
that
might
be
on
the
cards
,
I
call
to
mind
that
Mr
Micawber
,
about
this
time
,
composed
a
petition
to
the
House
of
Commons
,
praying
for
an
alteration
in
the
law
of
imprisonment
for
debt
.
 
<EOS>
I
set
down
this
remembrance
here
,
because
it
is
an
instance
to
myself
of
the
manner
in
which
I
fitted
my
old
books
to
my
altered
life
,
and
made
stories
for
myself
,
out
of
the
streets
,
and
out
of
men
and
women
;
and
how
some
main
points
in
the
character
I
shall
unconsciously
develop
,
I
suppose
,
in
writing
my
life
,
were
gradually
forming
all
this
while
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
club
in
the
prison
,
in
which
Mr
Micawber
,
as
a
gentleman
,
was
a
great
authority
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
had
stated
his
idea
of
this
petition
to
the
club
,
and
the
club
had
strongly
approved
of
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Wherefore
Mr
Micawber
(
who
was
a
thoroughly
good
-
natured
man
,
and
as
active
a
creature
about
everything
but
his
own
affairs
as
ever
existed
,
and
never
so
happy
as
when
he
was
busy
about
something
that
could
never
be
of
any
profit
to
him
)
set
to
work
at
the
petition
,
invented
it
,
engrossed
it
on
an
immense
sheet
of
paper
,
spread
it
out
on
a
table
,
and
appointed
a
time
for
all
the
club
,
and
all
within
the
walls
if
they
chose
,
to
come
up
to
his
room
and
sign
it
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
heard
of
this
approaching
ceremony
,
I
was
so
anxious
to
see
them
all
come
in
,
one
after
another
,
though
I
knew
the
greater
part
of
them
already
,
and
they
me
,
that
I
got
an
hour
's
leave
of
absence
from
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
,
and
established
myself
in
a
corner
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
As
many
of
the
principal
members
of
the
club
as
could
be
got
into
the
small
room
without
filling
it
,
supported
Mr
Micawber
in
front
of
the
petition
,
while
my
old
friend
Captain
Hopkins
(
who
had
washed
himself
,
to
do
honour
to
so
solemn
an
occasion
)
<EOS>
stationed
himself
close
to
it
,
to
read
it
to
all
who
were
unacquainted
with
its
contents
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
was
then
thrown
open
,
and
the
general
population
began
to
come
in
,
in
a
long
file
:
several
waiting
outside
,
while
one
entered
,
affixed
his
signature
,
and
went
out
.
 
<EOS>
To
everybody
in
succession
,
Captain
Hopkins
said
:
"
Have
you
read
it
?
"
---
"
No
.
"
 
---
"
Would
you
like
to
hear
it
read
?
"
 
<EOS>
If
he
weakly
showed
the
least
disposition
to
hear
it
,
Captain
Hopkins
,
in
a
loud
sonorous
voice
,
gave
him
every
word
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
Captain
would
have
read
it
twenty
thousand
times
,
if
twenty
thousand
people
would
have
heard
him
,
one
by
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
a
certain
luscious
roll
he
gave
to
such
phrases
as
"
The
people
's
representatives
in
Parliament
assembled
,
"
"
Your
petitioners
therefore
humbly
approach
your
honourable
house
,
"
"
His
gracious
Majesty
's
unfortunate
subjects
,
"
as
if
the
words
were
something
real
in
his
mouth
,
and
delicious
to
taste
;
Mr
Micawber
,
meanwhile
,
listening
with
a
little
of
an
author
's
vanity
,
and
contemplating
(
not
severely
)
the
spikes
on
the
opposite
wall
.
   
<EOS>
As
I
walked
to
and
fro
daily
between
Southwark
and
Blackfriars
,
and
lounged
about
at
meal
-
times
in
obscure
streets
,
the
stones
of
which
may
,
for
anything
I
know
,
be
worn
at
this
moment
by
my
childish
feet
,
I
wonder
how
many
of
these
people
were
wanting
in
the
crowd
that
used
to
come
filing
before
me
in
review
again
,
to
the
echo
of
Captain
Hopkins
's
voice
!
 
<EOS>
When
my
thoughts
go
back
,
now
,
to
that
slow
agony
of
my
youth
,
I
wonder
how
much
of
the
histories
I
invented
for
such
people
hangs
like
a
mist
of
fancy
over
well
-
remembered
facts
!
 
<EOS>
When
I
tread
the
old
ground
,
I
do
not
wonder
that
I
seem
to
see
and
pity
,
going
on
before
me
,
an
innocent
romantic
boy
,
making
his
imaginative
world
out
of
such
strange
experiences
and
sordid
things
!

<EOS>
Liking
life
on
my
own
account
no
better
,
I
form
a
great
resolution
 
<EOS>
In
due
time
,
Mr
Micawber
's
petition
was
ripe
for
hearing
;
and
that
gentleman
was
ordered
to
be
discharged
under
the
Act
,
to
my
great
joy
.
 
<EOS>
His
creditors
were
not
implacable
;
and
Mrs
Micawber
informed
me
that
even
the
revengeful
boot
-
maker
had
declared
in
open
court
that
he
bore
him
no
malice
,
but
that
when
money
was
owing
to
him
he
liked
to
be
paid
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
thought
it
was
human
nature
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
returned
to
the
King
's
Bench
when
his
case
was
over
,
as
some
fees
were
to
be
settled
,
and
some
formalities
observed
,
before
he
could
be
actually
released
.
 
<EOS>
The
club
received
him
with
transport
,
and
held
an
harmonic
meeting
that
evening
in
his
honour
;
while
Mrs
Micawber
and
I
had
a
lamb
's
fry
in
private
,
surrounded
by
the
sleeping
family
.
   
<EOS>
"
On
such
an
occasion
I
will
give
you
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
in
a
little
more
flip
,
"
for
we
had
been
having
some
already
,
"
the
memory
of
my
papa
and
mama
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
they
dead
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
after
drinking
the
toast
in
a
wine
-
glass
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
mama
departed
this
life
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
before
Mr
Micawber
's
difficulties
commenced
,
or
at
least
before
they
became
pressing
.
 
<EOS>
My
papa
lived
to
bail
Mr
Micawber
several
times
,
and
then
expired
,
regretted
by
a
numerous
circle
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
shook
her
head
,
and
dropped
a
pious
tear
upon
the
twin
who
happened
to
be
in
hand
.
   
<EOS>
As
I
could
hardly
hope
for
a
more
favourable
opportunity
of
putting
a
question
in
which
I
had
a
near
interest
,
I
said
to
Mrs
Micawber
:
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
,
ma'am
,
what
you
and
Mr
Micawber
intend
to
do
,
now
that
Mr
Micawber
is
out
of
his
difficulties
,
and
at
liberty
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
settled
yet
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
family
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
who
always
said
those
two
words
with
an
air
,
though
I
never
could
discover
who
came
under
the
denomination
,
"
my
family
are
of
opinion
that
Mr
Micawber
should
quit
London
,
and
exert
his
talents
in
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
is
a
man
of
great
talent
,
Master
Copperfield
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
said
I
was
sure
of
that
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
great
talent
,
"
repeated
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
family
are
of
opinion
,
that
,
with
a
little
interest
,
something
might
be
done
for
a
man
of
his
ability
in
the
Custom
House
.
 
<EOS>
The
influence
of
my
family
being
local
,
it
is
their
wish
that
Mr
Micawber
should
go
down
to
Plymouth
.
 
<EOS>
They
think
it
indispensable
that
he
should
be
upon
the
spot
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
he
may
be
ready
?
<EOS>
"
I
suggested
.
   
<EOS>
"
Exactly
,
"
returned
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
he
may
be
ready
---
in
case
of
anything
turning
up
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
do
you
go
too
,
ma'am
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
events
of
the
day
,
in
combination
with
the
twins
,
if
not
with
the
flip
,
had
made
Mrs
Micawber
hysterical
,
and
she
shed
tears
as
she
replied
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
will
desert
Mr
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
may
have
concealed
his
difficulties
from
me
in
the
first
instance
,
but
his
sanguine
temper
may
have
led
him
to
expect
that
he
would
overcome
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
pearl
necklace
and
bracelets
which
I
inherited
from
mama
,
have
been
disposed
of
for
less
than
half
their
value
;
and
the
set
of
coral
,
which
was
the
wedding
gift
of
my
papa
,
has
been
actually
thrown
away
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
never
will
desert
Mr
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
"
cried
Mrs
Micawber
,
more
affected
than
before
,
"
I
never
will
do
it
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
of
no
use
asking
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
felt
quite
uncomfortable
---
as
if
Mrs
Micawber
supposed
I
had
asked
her
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
!
---
and
sat
looking
at
her
in
alarm
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
has
his
faults
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
deny
that
he
is
improvident
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
deny
that
he
has
kept
me
in
the
dark
as
to
his
resources
and
his
liabilities
both

she
went
on
,
looking
at
the
wall
;
"
but
I
never
will
desert
Mr
Micawber
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
having
now
raised
her
voice
into
a
perfect
scream
,
I
was
so
frightened
that
I
ran
off
to
the
club
-
room
,
and
disturbed
Mr
Micawber
in
the
act
of
presiding
at
a
long
table
,
and
leading
the
chorus
of
   
Gee
up
,
Dobbin
,
Gee

Dobbin

Gee
up

Dobbin
,
Gee
up

o

with
the
tidings
that
Mrs
Micawber
was
in
an
alarming
state
,
upon
which
he
immediately
burst
into
tears
,
and
came
away
with
me
with
his
waistcoat
full
of
the
heads
and
tails
of
shrimps
,
of
which
he
had
been
partaking
.
   
<EOS>
"
Emma

cried
Mr
Micawber
,
running
into
the
room
;
"
what
is
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
will
desert
you
,
Micawber
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
life
!
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
taking
her
in
his
arms
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
perfectly
aware
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
the
parent
of
my
children
!
 
<EOS>
He
is
the
father
of
my
twins
!
<EOS>
He
is
the
husband
of
my
affections
,
"
cried
Mrs
Micawber
,
struggling
;
"
and
<EOS>
I
ne
---
<EOS>
ver
<EOS>
---
will
---
desert
Mr
Micawber
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
was
so
deeply
affected
by
this
proof
of
her
devotion
(
as
to
me
,
I
was
dissolved
in
tears
)
,
that
he
hung
over
her
in
a
passionate
manner
,
imploring
her
to
look
up
,
and
to
be
calm
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
more
he
asked
Mrs
Micawber
to
look
up
,
<EOS>
the
more
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
nothing
;
and
the
more
he
asked
her
to
compose
herself
,
the
more
she
would
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Consequently
Mr
Micawber
was
soon
so
overcome
,
that
he
mingled
his
tears
with
hers
and
mine
;
until
he
begged
me
to
do
him
the
favour
of
taking
a
chair
on
the
staircase
,
while
he
got
her
into
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
taken
my
leave
for
the
night
,
but
he
would
not
hear
of
my
doing
that
until
the
strangers
'
bell
should
ring
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
sat
at
the
staircase
window
,
until
he
came
out
with
another
chair
and
joined
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
is
Mrs
Micawber
now
,
sir
?
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
low
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
shaking
his
head
;
"
reaction
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
this
has
been
a
dreadful
day
!
 
<EOS>
We
stand
alone
now
---
everything
is
gone
from
us
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
pressed
my
hand
,
and
groaned
,
and
afterwards
shed
tears
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
greatly
touched
,
and
disappointed
too
,
for
I
had
expected
that
we
should
be
quite
gay
on
this
happy
and
long
-
looked
-
for
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
were
so
used
to
their
old
difficulties
,
I
think
,
that
they
felt
quite
shipwrecked
when
they
came
to
consider
that
they
were
released
from
them
.
 
<EOS>
All
their
elasticity
was
departed
,
and
I
never
saw
them
half
<EOS>
so
wretched
as
on
this
night
;
insomuch
that
when
the
bell
rang
,
and
Mr
Micawber
walked
with
me
to
the
lodge
,
and
parted
from
me
there
with
a
blessing
,
I
felt
quite
afraid
to
leave
him
by
himself
,
he
was
so
profoundly
miserable
.
   
<EOS>
But
through
all
the
confusion
and
lowness
of
spirits
in
which
we
had
been
,
so
unexpectedly
to
me
,
involved
,
I
plainly
discerned
that
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
and
their
family
were
going
away
from
London
,
and
that
a
parting
between
us
was
near
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
my
walk
home
that
night
,
and
in
the
sleepless
hours
which
followed
when
I
lay
in
bed
,
that
the
thought
first
occurred
to
me
---
though
I
do
n't
know
how
it
came
into
my
head
---
which
afterwards
shaped
itself
into
a
settled
resolution
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
grown
to
be
so
accustomed
to
the
Micawbers
,
and
had
been
so
intimate
with
them
in
their
distresses
,
and
was
so
utterly
friendless
without
them
,
that
the
prospect
of
being
thrown
upon
some
new
shift
for
a
lodging
,
and
going
once
more
among
unknown
people
,
was
like
being
that
moment
turned
adrift
into
my
present
life
,
with
such
a
knowledge
of
it
ready
made
as
experience
had
given
me
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
sensitive
feelings
it
wounded
so
cruelly
<EOS>
,
all
the
shame
and
misery
it
kept
alive
within
my
breast
,
became
more
poignant
as
I
thought
of
this
;
and
I
determined
that
the
life
was
unendurable
.
   
<EOS>
That
there
was
no
hope
of
escape
from
it
,
<EOS>
unless
the
escape
was
my
own
act
,
I
knew
quite
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
rarely
heard
from
Miss
Murdstone
,
and
never
from
Mr
Murdstone
:
but
two
or
three
parcels
of
made
or
mended
clothes
had
come
up
for
me
,
consigned
to
Mr
Quinion
,
and
in
each
there
was
a
scrap
of
paper
to
the
effect
that
J*M
trusted
D*C
was
applying
himself
to
business
,
and
devoting
himself
wholly
to
his
duties
---
not
the
least
hint
of
my
ever
being
anything
else
than
the
common
drudge
into
which
I
was
fast
settling
down
.
   
<EOS>
The
very
next
day
showed
me
,
while
my
mind
was
in
the
first
agitation
of
what
it
had
conceived
,
that
Mrs
Micawber
had
not
spoken
of
their
going
away
without
warrant
.
 
<EOS>
They
took
a
lodging
in
the
house
where
I
lived
,
for
a
week
;
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
they
were
to
start
for
Plymouth
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
himself
came
down
to
the
counting
-
house
,
in
the
afternoon
,
to
tell
Mr
Quinion
that
he
must
relinquish
me
on
the
day
of
his
departure
,
and
to
give
me
a
high
character
,
which
I
am
sure
I
deserved
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mr
Quinion
,
calling
in
Tipp
the
carman
,
who
was
a
married
man
,
and
had
a
room
to
let
,
quartered
me
prospectively
on
him
---
by
our
mutual
consent
,
as
he
had
every
reason
to
think
;
for
I
said
nothing
,
though
my
resolution
was
now
taken
.
   
<EOS>
I
passed
my
evenings
with
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
,
during
the
remaining
term
of
our
residence
under
the
same
roof
;
and
I
think
we
became
fonder
of
one
another
as
the
time
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
last
Sunday
,
they
invited
me
to
dinner
;
and
we
had
a
loin
of
pork
and
apple
sauce
,
and
a
pudding
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
bought
a
spotted
wooden
horse
over
-
night
as
a
parting
gift
to
little
Wilkins
Micawber
<EOS>
---
that
was
the
boy
---
and
a
doll
for
little
Emma
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
also
bestowed
a
shilling
on
the
Orfling
,
who
was
about
to
be
disbanded
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
a
very
pleasant
day
,
though
we
were
all
in
a
tender
state
about
our
approaching
separation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
revert
to
the
period
when
Mr
Micawber
was
in
difficulties
,
without
thinking
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
Your
conduct
has
always
been
of
the
most
delicate
and
obliging
description
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
never
been
a
lodger
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
been
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
;
"
Copperfield
,
"
for
so
he
had
been
accustomed
to
call
me
,
of
late
,
"
has
a
heart
to
feel
for
the
distresses
of
his
fellow
-
creatures
when
they
are
behind
a
cloud
,
and
a
head
to
plan
,
and
a
hand
to
---
in
short
,
a
general
ability
to
dispose
of
such
available
property
as
could
be
made
away
with
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
expressed
my
sense
of
this
commendation
,
and
said
I
was
very
sorry
we
were
going
to
lose
one
another
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
young
friend
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
I
am
older
than
you
;
a
man
of
some
experience
in
life
,
and
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
of
some
experience
,
in
short
,
in
difficulties
,
generally
speaking
.
 
<EOS>
At
present
,
and
until
something
turns
up
(
which
I
am
,
I
may
say
,
hourly
expecting
)
,
I
have
nothing
to
bestow
but
advice
.
 
<EOS>
Still
my
advice
is
so
far
worth
taking
,
that
---
in
short
,
that
I
have
never
taken
it
myself
,
and
am
the

---
here
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
who
had
been
beaming
and
smiling
,
all
over
his
head
and
face
,
up
to
the
present
moment
,
checked
himself
and
frowned
---
"
the
miserable
wretch
you
behold
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Micawber
!
"
urged
his
wife
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
returned
Mr
Micawber
,
quite
forgetting
himself
,
and
smiling
again
,
"
the
miserable
wretch
you
behold
.
 
<EOS>
My
advice
is
,
never
do
tomorrow
what
you
can
do
today
.
 
<EOS>
Procrastination
is
the
thief
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
Collar
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
poor
papa
's
maxim
,
"
Mrs
Micawber
observed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
your
papa
was
very
well
in
his
way
,
and
Heaven
forbid
that
I
should
disparage
him
.
 
<EOS>
Take
him
for
all
in
all
,
we
ne'er
shall
---
in
short
,
make
the
acquaintance
,
probably
,
of
anybody
else
possessing
,
at
his
time
of
life
,
the
same
legs
for
gaiters
,
and
able
to
read
the
same
description
of
print
,
without
spectacles
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
applied
that
maxim
to
our
marriage
,
my
dear
;
and
that
was
so
far
prematurely
entered
into
,
in
consequence
,
that
I
never
recovered
the
expense
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
looked
aside
at
Mrs
Micawber
,
and
added
:
"
Not
that
I
am
sorry
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
the
contrary
,
my
love
.
"
 
<EOS>
After
which
,
he
was
grave
for
a
minute
or
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
other
piece
of
advice
,
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Annual
income

annual
expenditure

<EOS>
Annual
income
twenty

expenditure
twenty
pounds

six

result
misery

<EOS>
The
blossom
is
blighted
,
the
leaf
is
withered
,
the
god
of
day
goes
down
upon
the
dreary
scene
,
and
---
and
in
short
you
are
for
ever
floored
.
<EOS>
As
I
am
!
"
   
<EOS>
To
make
his
example
the
more
impressive
,
Mr
Micawber
drank
a
glass
of
punch
with
an
air
of
great
enjoyment
and
satisfaction
,
and
whistled
the
College
Hornpipe
.
   
<EOS>
I
did
not
fail
to
assure
him
that
I
would
store
these
precepts
in
my
mind
,
though
indeed
I
had
no
need
to
do
so
,
for
,
at
the
time
,
they
affected
me
visibly
.
 
<EOS>
Next
morning
I
met
the
whole
family
at
the
coach
office
,
and
saw
them
,
with
a
desolate
heart
,
take
their
places
outside
,
at
the
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
Master
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
God
bless
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
can
forget
all
that
,
you
know
,
and
I
never
would
if
I
could
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
farewell
!
 
<EOS>
Every
happiness
and
prosperity
!
 
<EOS>
If
,
in
the
progress
of
revolving
years
,
I
could
persuade
myself
that
my
blighted
destiny
had
been
a
warning
to
you
,
I
should
feel
that
I
had
not
occupied
another
man
's
place
in
existence
altogether
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
In
case
of
anything
turning
up
(
of
which
I
am
rather
confident
)
,
I
shall
be
extremely
happy
if
it
should
be
in
my
power
to
improve
your
prospects
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
think
,
as
Mrs
Micawber
sat
at
the
back
of
the
coach
,
with
the
children
,
and
I
stood
in
the
road
looking
wistfully
at
them
,
a
mist
cleared
from
her
eyes
,
and
she
saw
what
a
little
creature
I
really
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
so
,
because
she
beckoned
to
me
to
climb
up
,
with
quite
a
new
and
motherly
expression
in
her
face
,
and
put
her
arm
<EOS>
round
my
neck
,
and
gave
me
just
such
a
kiss
as
she
might
have
given
to
her
own
boy
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
barely
time
to
get
down
again
before
the
coach
started
,
and
I
could
hardly
see
the
family
for
the
handkerchiefs
they
waved
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
gone
in
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
The
Orfling
and
I
stood
looking
vacantly
at
each
other
in
the
middle
of
the
road
,
and
then
shook
hands
and
said
good
-
bye
<EOS>
;
she
going
back
,
I
suppose
,
to
St
Luke
's
workhouse
,
as
I
went
to
begin
my
weary
day
at
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
.
   
<EOS>
But
with
no
intention
of
passing
many
more
weary
days
there
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
had
resolved
to
run
away
.
 
<EOS>
---
To
go
,
by
some
means
or
other
,
down
into
the
country
,
to
the
only
relation
I
had
in
the
world
,
and
tell
my
story
to
my
aunt
,
Miss
Betsey
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
observed
that
I
do
n't
know
how
this
desperate
idea
came
into
my
brain
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
once
there
,
it
remained
there
;
and
hardened
into
a
purpose
than
which
I
have
never
entertained
a
more
determined
purpose
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
far
from
sure
that
I
believed
there
was
anything
hopeful
in
it
,
but
my
mind
was
thoroughly
made
up
that
it
must
be
carried
into
execution
.
   
<EOS>
Again
,
and
again
,
and
a
hundred
times
again
,
since
the
night
when
the
thought
had
first
occurred
to
me
and
banished
sleep
,
I
had
gone
over
that
old
story
of
my
poor
mother
<EOS>
's
about
my
birth
,
which
it
had
been
one
of
my
great
delights
in
the
old
time
to
hear
her
tell
,
and
<EOS>
which
I
knew
by
heart
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
walked
into
that
story
,
and
walked
out
of
it
,
a
dread
and
awful
personage
;
but
there
was
one
little
trait
in
her
behaviour
which
I
liked
to
dwell
on
,
and
which
gave
me
some
faint
shadow
of
encouragement
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
forget
how
my
mother
had
thought
that
she
felt
her
touch
her
pretty
hair
with
no
ungentle
hand
;
and
though
it
might
have
been
altogether
my
mother
's
fancy
,
and
might
have
had
no
foundation
whatever
in
fact
,
I
made
a
little
picture
,
out
of
it
,
of
my
terrible
aunt
relenting
towards
the
girlish
beauty
that
I
recollected
so
well
and
loved
so
much
,
which
softened
the
whole
narrative
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
possible
that
it
had
been
in
my
mind
a
long
time
,
and
had
gradually
engendered
my
determination
.
   
<EOS>
As
I
did
not
even
know
where
Miss
Betsey
lived
,
I
wrote
a
long
letter
to
Peggotty
,
and
asked
her
,
incidentally
,
if
she
remembered
;
pretending
that
I
had
heard
of
such
a
lady
living
at
a
certain
place
I
named
at
random
,
and
had
a
curiosity
to
know
if
it
were
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
that
letter
,
I
told
Peggotty
that
I
had
a
particular
occasion
for
half
a
guinea
;
and
that
if
she
could
lend
me
that
sum
until
I
could
repay
it
,
I
should
be
very
much
obliged
to
her
,
and
would
tell
her
afterwards
what
I
had
wanted
it
for
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
's
answer
soon
arrived
,
and
was
,
as
usual
,
full
of
affectionate
devotion
.
 
<EOS>
She
enclosed
the
half
guinea
(
I
was
afraid
she
must
have
had
a
world
of
trouble
to
get
it
out
of
Mr
Barkis
's
box
)
,
and
told
me
that
Miss
Betsey
lived
near
Dover
,
but
whether
at
Dover
itself
,
at
Hythe
,
Sandgate
,
or
Folkestone
,
she
could
not
say
.
<EOS>
One
of
our
men
,
however
,
informing
me
on
my
asking
him
about
these
places
,
that
they
were
all
close
together
,
I
deemed
this
enough
for
my
object
,
and
resolved
to
set
out
at
the
end
of
that
week
.
   
<EOS>
Being
a
very
honest
little
creature
,
and
unwilling
to
disgrace
the
memory
I
was
going
to
leave
behind
me
at
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
,
I
considered
myself
bound
to
remain
until
Saturday
night
;
and
,
as
I
had
been
paid
a
week
's
wages
in
advance
when
I
first
came
there
,
not
to
present
myself
in
the
counting
-
house
at
the
usual
hour
,
to
receive
my
stipend
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
express
reason
,
I
had
borrowed
the
half
-
guinea
,
that
I
might
not
be
without
a
fund
for
my
travelling
-
expenses
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
when
the
Saturday
night
came
,
and
we
were
all
waiting
in
the
warehouse
to
be
paid
,
and
Tipp
the
carman
,
who
always
took
precedence
,
went
in
first
to
draw
his
money
,
I
shook
Mick
Walker
by
the
hand
;
asked
him
,
when
it
came
to
his
turn
to
be
paid
,
to
say
to
Mr
Quinion
that
I
had
gone
to
move
my
box
to
Tipp
's
;
and
,
bidding
a
last
good
night
to
Mealy
Potatoes
,
ran
away
.
   
<EOS>
My
box
was
at
my
old
lodging
,
over
the
water
,
and
I
had
written
a
direction
for
it
on
the
back
of
one
of
our
address
cards
that
we
nailed
on
the
casks
:
<EOS>
"
Master
David
,
to
be
left
till
called
for
,
at
the
Coach
Office
,
Dover
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
I
had
in
my
pocket
ready
to
put
on
the
box
,
after
I
should
have
got
it
out
of
the
house
;
and
as
I
went
towards
my
lodging
,
I
looked
about
me
for
someone
who
would
help
me
to
carry
it
to
the
booking
-
office
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
long
-
legged
young
man
with
a
very
little
empty
donkey
-
cart
,
standing
near
the
Obelisk
,
in
the
Blackfriars
Road
,
whose
eye
I
caught
as
I
was
going
by
,
and
who
,
addressing
me
as
"
Sixpenn'orth
of
bad
ha'pence
,
"
hoped
"
I
should
know
him
agin
to
swear
to
"
---
in
allusion
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
to
my
staring
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
stopped
to
assure
him
that
I
had
not
done
so
in
bad
manners
,
but
uncertain
whether
he
might
or
might
not
like
a
job
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
job
?
"
said
the
long
-
legged
young
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
move
a
box
,
"
I
answered
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
box
?
"
said
the
long
-
legged
young
man
.
   
<EOS>
I
told
him
mine
,
which
was
down
that
street
there
,
and
which
I
wanted
him
to
take
to
the
Dover
coach
office
for
sixpence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Done
with
you
for
a
tanner
!
"
said
the
long
-
legged
young
man
,
and
directly
got
upon
his
cart
,
which
was
nothing
but
a
large
wooden
tray
on
wheels
,
and
rattled
away
at
such
a
rate
,
that
it
was
as
much
as
I
could
do
to
keep
pace
with
the
donkey
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
defiant
manner
about
this
young
man
,
and
particularly
about
the
way
in
which
he
chewed
straw
as
he
spoke
to
me
,
that
I
did
not
much
like
;
as
the
bargain
was
made
,
however
,
I
took
him
upstairs
to
the
room
I
was
leaving
,
and
we
brought
the
box
down
,
and
put
it
on
his
cart
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
was
unwilling
to
put
the
direction
-
card
on
there
,
lest
any
of
my
landlord
's
family
should
fathom
what
I
was
doing
,
and
detain
me
;
so
I
said
to
the
young
man
that
I
would
be
glad
if
he
would
stop
for
a
minute
,
when
he
came
to
the
dead
-
wall
of
the
King
's
Bench
prison
.
 
<EOS>
The
words
were
no
sooner
out
of
my
mouth
,
than
he
rattled
away
as
if
he
,
my
box
,
the
cart
,
and
the
donkey
,
were
all
equally
mad
;
and
I
was
quite
out
of
breath
with
running
and
calling
after
him
,
when
I
caught
him
at
the
place
appointed
.
   
<EOS>
Being
much
flushed
and
excited
,
I
tumbled
my
half
-
guinea
out
of
my
pocket
in
pulling
the
card
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
it
in
my
mouth
for
safety
,
and
though
my
hands
trembled
a
good
deal
,
had
just
tied
the
card
on
very
much
to
my
satisfaction
,
when
I
felt
myself
violently
chucked
under
the
chin
by
the
long
-
legged
young
man
,
and
saw
my
half
-
guinea
fly
out
of
my
mouth
into
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wot
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
young
man
,
seizing
me
by
my
jacket
collar
,
with
a
frightful
grin
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
pollis
case
,
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
-
going
to
bolt
,
are
you
?
 
<EOS>
Come
to
the
pollis
,
you
young
warmin
,
come
to
the
pollis
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
give
me
my
money
back
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
I
,
very
much
frightened
;
"
and
leave
me
alone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
to
the
pollis
!
"
said
the
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
prove
it
yourn
to
the
pollis
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Give
me
my
box
and
money
,
will
you
,
"
I
cried
,
bursting
into
tears
.
   
<EOS>
The
young
man
still
replied
:
"
Come
to
the
pollis
!
"
and
was
dragging
me
against
the
donkey
in
a
violent
manner
,
as
if
there
were
any
affinity
between
that
animal
and
a
magistrate
,
when
he
changed
his
mind
,
jumped
into
the
cart
,
sat
upon
my
box
,
and
,
exclaiming
that
he
would
drive
to
the
pollis
straight
,
rattled
away
harder
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
I
ran
after
him
as
fast
as
I
could
,
but
I
had
no
breath
to
call
out
with
,
and
should
not
have
dared
to
call
out
,
now
,
if
I
had
.
 
<EOS>
I
narrowly
escaped
being
run
over
,
twenty
times
at
least
,
in
half
a
mile
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
lost
him
,
now
I
saw
him
,
now
I
lost
him
,
now
I
was
cut
at
with
a
whip
,
now
shouted
at
,
now
down
in
the
mud
,
now
up
again
,
now
running
into
somebody
's
arms
,
now
running
headlong
at
a
post
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
confused
by
fright
and
heat
,
and
doubting
whether
half
London
might
not
by
this
time
be
turning
out
for
my
apprehension
,
I
left
the
young
man
to
go
where
he
would
with
my
box
and
money
;
and
,
panting
and
crying
,
but
never
stopping
,
faced
about
for
Greenwich
,
which
I
had
understood
was
on
the
Dover
Road
:
taking
very
little
more
out
of
the
world
,
towards
the
retreat
of
my
aunt
,
Miss
Betsey
,
than
I
had
brought
into
it
,
on
the
night
when
my
arrival
gave
her
so
much
umbrage
.

Chapter
13
.
<EOS>
The
sequel
of
my
resolution
 
For
anything
I
know
,
I
may
have
had
some
wild
idea
of
running
all
the
way
to
Dover
,
when
I
gave
up
the
pursuit
of
the
young
man
with
the
donkey
-
cart
,
and
started
for
Greenwich
.
 
<EOS>
My
scattered
senses
were
soon
collected
as
to
that
point
,
if
I
had
;
for
I
came
to
a
stop
in
the
Kent
Road
,
at
a
terrace
with
a
piece
of
water
before
it
,
and
a
great
foolish
image
in
the
middle
,
blowing
a
dry
shell
.
<EOS>
Here
I
sat
down
on
a
doorstep
,
quite
spent
and
exhausted
with
the
efforts
I
had
already
made
,
and
with
hardly
breath
enough
to
cry
for
the
loss
of
my
box
and
half
-
guinea
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
by
this
time
dark
<EOS>
;
I
heard
the
clocks
strike
ten
,
as
I
sat
resting
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
a
summer
night
,
fortunately
,
and
fine
weather
.
<EOS>
When
I
had
recovered
my
breath
,
and
had
got
rid
of
a
stifling
sensation
in
my
throat
,
I
rose
up
and
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
my
distress
,
I
had
no
notion
of
going
back
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
I
should
have
had
any
,
though
there
had
been
a
Swiss
snow
-
drift
in
the
Kent
Road
.
   
<EOS>
But
my
standing
possessed
of
only
three
-
halfpence
in
the
world
(
and
I
am
sure
I
wonder
how
they
came
to
be
left
in
my
pocket
on
a
Saturday
night
!
)
<EOS>
troubled
me
none
the
less
because
I
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
began
to
picture
to
myself
,
as
a
scrap
of
newspaper
intelligence
,
my
being
found
dead
in
a
day
or
two
,
under
some
hedge
;
and
I
trudged
on
miserably
,
though
as
fast
as
I
could
,
until
I
happened
to
pass
a
little
shop
,
where
it
was
written
up
that
ladies
'
and
gentlemen
's
wardrobes
were
bought
,
and
that
the
best
price
was
given
for
rags
,
bones
,
and
kitchen
-
stuff
.
 
<EOS>
The
master
of
this
shop
was
sitting
at
the
door
in
his
shirt
-
sleeves
,
smoking
;
and
as
there
were
a
great
many
coats
and
pairs
of
trousers
dangling
from
the
low
ceiling
,
and
<EOS>
only
two
feeble
candles
burning
inside
to
show
what
they
were
,
I
fancied
that
he
looked
like
a
man
of
a
revengeful
disposition
,
who
had
hung
all
his
enemies
,
and
was
enjoying
himself
.
   
<EOS>
My
late
experiences
with
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
suggested
to
me
that
here
might
be
a
means
of
keeping
off
the
wolf
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
I
went
up
the
next
by
-
street
,
took
off
my
waistcoat
,
rolled
it
neatly
under
my
arm
,
and
came
back
to
the
shop
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
sir
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
am
to
sell
this
for
a
fair
price
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dolloby
<EOS>
---
Dolloby
was
the
name
over
the
shop
door
,
at
least
---
took
the
waistcoat
,
stood
his
pipe
on
its
head
,
against
the
door
-
post
,
went
into
the
shop
,
followed
by
me
,
snuffed
the
two
candles
with
his
fingers
,
spread
the
waistcoat
on
the
counter
,
and
looked
at
it
there
,
held
it
up
against
the
light
,
and
looked
at
it
there
,
and
ultimately
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
What
do
you
call
a
price
,
now
,
for
this
here
little
weskit
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
know
best
,
sir
,
"
I
returned
modestly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
be
buyer
and
seller
too
,
"
said
Mr
Dolloby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Put
a
price
on
this
here
little
weskit
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
eighteenpence
be
?
"
<EOS>
---
I
hinted
,
after
some
hesitation
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dolloby
rolled
it
up
again
,
and
gave
it
me
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
rob
my
family
,
"
he
said
,
"
if
I
was
to
offer
ninepence
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
a
disagreeable
way
of
putting
the
business
;
because
it
imposed
upon
me
,
a
perfect
stranger
,
the
unpleasantness
of
asking
Mr
Dolloby
to
rob
his
family
on
my
account
.
 
<EOS>
My
circumstances
being
so
very
pressing
,
however
,
I
said
I
would
take
ninepence
for
it
,
if
he
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dolloby
,
not
without
some
grumbling
,
gave
ninepence
.
 
<EOS>
I
wished
him
good
night
,
and
walked
out
of
the
shop
the
richer
by
that
sum
,
and
the
poorer
by
a
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
I
buttoned
my
jacket
,
that
was
not
much
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
foresaw
pretty
clearly
that
my
jacket
would
go
next
,
and
that
I
should
have
to
make
the
best
of
my
way
to
Dover
in
a
shirt
and
a
pair
of
trousers
,
and
might
deem
myself
lucky
if
I
got
there
even
in
that
trim
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
mind
did
not
run
so
much
on
this
as
might
be
supposed
.
 
<EOS>
Beyond
a
general
impression
of
the
distance
before
me
,
and
of
the
young
man
with
the
donkey
-
cart
having
used
me
cruelly
,
I
think
I
had
no
very
urgent
sense
of
my
difficulties
when
I
once
again
set
off
with
my
ninepence
in
my
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
A
plan
had
occurred
to
me
for
passing
the
night
,
which
I
was
going
to
carry
into
execution
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
,
to
lie
behind
the
wall
at
the
back
of
my
old
school
,
in
a
corner
where
there
used
to
be
a
haystack
.
 
<EOS>
I
imagined
it
would
be
a
kind
of
company
to
have
the
boys
,
and
the
bedroom
where
I
used
to
tell
the
stories
,
so
near
me
:
although
the
boys
would
know
nothing
of
my
being
there
,
and
the
bedroom
would
yield
me
no
shelter
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
had
a
hard
day
's
work
,
and
was
pretty
well
jaded
when
I
came
climbing
out
,
at
last
,
upon
the
level
of
Blackheath
.
 
<EOS>
It
cost
me
some
trouble
to
find
out
Salem
House
;
but
I
found
it
,
and
I
found
a
haystack
in
the
corner
,
and
I
lay
down
by
it
;
having
first
walked
round
the
wall
,
and
looked
up
at
the
windows
,
and
seen
that
all
was
dark
and
silent
within
.
 
<EOS>
Never
shall
I
forget
the
lonely
sensation
of
first
lying
down
,
without
a
roof
above
my
head
!
   
<EOS>
Sleep
came
upon
me
as
it
came
on
many
other
outcasts
,
against
whom
house
-
doors
were
locked
,
and
house
-
dogs
barked
,
that
night
---
and
I
dreamed
of
lying
on
my
old
school
-
bed
,
talking
to
the
boys
in
my
room
;
and
found
myself
sitting
upright
,
with
Steerforth
's
name
upon
my
lips
,
looking
wildly
at
the
stars
that
were
glistening
and
glimmering
above
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
remembered
where
I
was
at
that
untimely
hour
,
a
feeling
stole
upon
me
that
made
me
get
up
,
afraid
of
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
,
and
walk
about
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
fainter
glimmering
of
the
stars
,
and
the
pale
light
in
the
sky
where
the
day
was
coming
,
reassured
me
:
and
<EOS>
my
eyes
being
very
heavy
,
I
lay
down
again
and
slept
---
<EOS>
though
with
a
knowledge
in
my
sleep
that
it
was
cold
---
until
the
warm
beams
of
the
sun
,
and
the
ringing
of
the
getting
-
up
bell
at
Salem
House
,
awoke
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
could
have
hoped
that
Steerforth
was
there
,
I
would
have
lurked
about
until
he
came
out
alone
;
but
I
knew
he
must
have
left
long
since
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
still
remained
,
perhaps
,
but
it
was
very
doubtful
;
and
I
had
not
sufficient
confidence
in
his
discretion
or
good
luck
,
however
strong
my
reliance
was
on
his
good
nature
,
to
wish
to
trust
him
with
my
situation
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
crept
away
from
the
wall
as
Mr
Creakle
's
boys
were
getting
up
,
and
struck
into
the
long
dusty
track
which
I
had
first
known
to
be
the
Dover
Road
when
I
was
one
of
them
,
and
when
I
little
expected
that
any
eyes
would
ever
see
me
the
wayfarer
I
was
now
,
upon
it
.
   
<EOS>
What
a
different
Sunday
morning
from
the
old
Sunday
morning
at
Yarmouth
!
 
<EOS>
In
due
time
I
heard
the
church
-
bells
ringing
,
as
I
plodded
on
;
and
I
met
people
who
were
going
to
church
;
and
I
passed
a
church
or
two
where
the
congregation
were
inside
,
and
the
sound
of
singing
came
out
into
the
sunshine
,
while
the
beadle
sat
and
cooled
himself
in
the
shade
of
the
porch
,
or
stood
beneath
the
yew
-
tree
,
with
his
hand
to
his
forehead
,
glowering
at
me
going
by
.
<EOS>
But
the
peace
and
rest
of
the
old
Sunday
morning
were
on
everything
,
except
me
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
the
difference
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
quite
wicked
in
my
dirt
and
dust
,
with
my
tangled
hair
.
 
<EOS>
But
for
the
quiet
picture
I
had
conjured
up
,
of
my
mother
in
her
youth
and
beauty
,
weeping
by
the
fire
,
and
my
aunt
relenting
to
her
<EOS>
,
I
hardly
think
I
should
have
had
the
courage
to
go
on
until
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
always
went
before
me
,
and
I
followed
.
   
<EOS>
I
got
,
that
Sunday
,
through
three
-
and
-
twenty
miles
on
the
straight
road
,
though
not
very
easily
,
for
I
was
new
to
that
kind
of
toil
.
<EOS>
I
see
myself
,
as
evening
closes
in
,
coming
over
the
bridge
at
Rochester
,
footsore
and
tired
,
and
eating
bread
that
I
had
bought
for
supper
.
 
<EOS>
One
or
two
little
houses
,
with
the
notice
,
"
Lodgings
for
Travellers
"
,
hanging
out
,
had
tempted
me
;
but
I
was
afraid
of
spending
the
few
pence
I
had
,
and
was
even
more
afraid
of
the
vicious
looks
of
the
trampers
I
had
met
or
overtaken
.
 
<EOS>
I
sought
no
shelter
,
therefore
,
but
the
sky
;
and
toiling
into
Chatham
,
---
which
,
in
that
night
's
aspect
,
is
a
mere
dream
of
chalk
,
and
drawbridges
,
and
mastless
ships
in
a
muddy
river
,
roofed
like
Noah
's
arks
,
---
crept
,
at
last
,
upon
a
sort
of
grass
-
grown
battery
overhanging
a
lane
,
where
a
sentry
was
walking
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
Here
I
lay
down
,
near
a
cannon
;
and
,
happy
in
the
society
of
the
sentry
's
footsteps
,
though
he
knew
no
more
of
my
being
above
him
than
the
boys
at
Salem
House
<EOS>
had
known
of
my
lying
by
the
wall
,
slept
soundly
until
morning
.
   
<EOS>
Very
stiff
and
sore
of
foot
I
was
in
the
morning
,
and
quite
dazed
by
the
beating
of
drums
and
marching
of
troops
,
which
seemed
to
hem
me
in
on
every
side
when
I
went
down
towards
the
long
narrow
street
.
 
<EOS>
Feeling
that
I
could
go
but
a
very
little
way
that
day
,
if
I
were
to
reserve
any
strength
for
getting
to
my
journey
's
end
,
I
resolved
to
make
the
sale
of
my
jacket
its
principal
business
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
I
took
the
jacket
off
,
that
I
might
learn
to
do
without
it
;
and
carrying
it
under
my
arm
,
began
a
tour
of
inspection
of
the
various
slop
-
shops
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
likely
place
to
sell
a
jacket
in
;
for
the
dealers
in
second
-
hand
clothes
were
numerous
,
and
were
,
generally
speaking
,
on
the
look
-
out
for
customers
at
their
shop
doors
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
most
of
them
had
,
hanging
up
among
their
stock
,
an
officer
's
coat
or
two
,
epaulettes
and
all
,
I
was
rendered
timid
by
the
costly
nature
of
their
dealings
,
and
walked
about
for
a
long
time
without
offering
my
merchandise
to
anyone
.
   
<EOS>
This
modesty
of
mine
directed
my
attention
to
the
marine
-
store
shops
,
and
such
shops
as
Mr
Dolloby
's
,
in
preference
to
the
regular
dealers
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
I
found
one
that
I
thought
looked
promising
,
at
the
corner
of
a
dirty
lane
,
ending
in
an
enclosure
full
of
stinging
-
nettles
,
against
the
palings
of
which
<EOS>
some
second
-
hand
sailors
'
clothes
,
that
seemed
to
have
overflowed
the
shop
,
were
fluttering
among
some
cots
,
and
rusty
guns
,
and
oilskin
hats
,
and
certain
trays
full
of
so
many
old
rusty
keys
of
so
many
sizes
that
they
seemed
various
enough
to
open
all
the
doors
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
Into
this
shop
,
which
was
low
and
small
,
and
which
was
darkened
rather
than
lighted
by
a
little
window
,
overhung
with
clothes
,
and
was
descended
into
by
some
steps
,
I
went
with
a
palpitating
heart
;
which
was
not
relieved
when
an
ugly
old
man
,
with
the
lower
part
of
his
face
all
covered
with
a
stubbly
grey
beard
,
rushed
out
of
a
dirty
den
behind
it
,
and
seized
me
by
the
hair
of
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
dreadful
old
man
to
look
at
,
in
a
filthy
flannel
waistcoat
,
and
smelling
terribly
of
rum
.
 
<EOS>
His
bedstead
,
covered
with
a
tumbled
and
ragged
piece
of
patchwork
,
was
in
the
den
he
had
come
from
,
where
another
little
window
showed
a
prospect
of
more
stinging
-
nettles
,
and
a
lame
donkey
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
grinned
this
old
man
,
in
a
fierce
,
monotonous
whine
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
eyes
and
limbs
,
what
do
you
want
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
lungs
and
liver
,
what
do
you
want
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
goroo
,
goroo
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
so
much
dismayed
by
these
words
,
and
particularly
by
the
repetition
of
the
last
unknown
one
,
which
was
a
kind
of
rattle
in
his
throat
,
that
I
could
make
no
answer
;
<EOS>
hereupon
the
old
man
,
still
holding
me
by
the
hair
,
repeated
:
   
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
do
you
want
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
eyes
and
limbs
,
what
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
lungs
and
liver
,
what
do
you
want
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
goroo
!
"
<EOS>
---
which
he
screwed
out
of
himself
,
with
an
energy
that
made
his
eyes
start
in
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wanted
to
know
,
"
I
said
,
trembling
,
"
if
you
would
buy
a
jacket
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
let
's
see
the
jacket
!
"
cried
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
heart
on
fire
,
show
the
jacket
to
us
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
eyes
and
limbs
,
bring
the
jacket
out
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
he
took
his
trembling
hands
,
which
were
like
the
claws
of
a
great
bird
,
out
of
my
hair
;
and
put
on
a
pair
of
spectacles
,
not
at
all
ornamental
to
his
inflamed
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
how
much
for
the
jacket
?
"
cried
the
old
man
,
after
examining
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
---
goroo
!
<EOS>
---
how
much
for
the
jacket
?
"
   
"
Half
-
a
-
crown
,
"
I
answered
,
recovering
myself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
lungs
and
liver
,
"
cried
the
old
man
,
"
no
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
eyes
,
no
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
limbs
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
Eighteenpence
.
 
<EOS>
Goroo
!
"
   
<EOS>
Every
time
he
uttered
this
ejaculation
,
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
in
danger
of
starting
out
;
and
every
sentence
he
spoke
,
he
delivered
in
a
sort
of
tune
,
always
exactly
the
same
,
and
more
like
a
gust
of
wind
,
which
begins
low
,
mounts
up
high
,
and
falls
again
,
than
any
other
comparison
I
can
find
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
I
,
glad
to
have
closed
the
bargain
,
"
I
'll
take
eighteenpence
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
liver
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
old
man
,
throwing
the
jacket
on
a
shelf
.
"
<EOS>
Get
out
of
the
shop
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
lungs
,
get
out
of
the
shop
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
eyes
and
limbs
---
goroo
!
<EOS>
---
do
n't
ask
for
money
;
make
it
an
exchange
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
never
was
so
frightened
in
my
life
,
before
or
since
;
but
I
told
him
humbly
that
I
wanted
money
,
and
that
nothing
else
was
of
any
use
to
me
,
but
that
I
would
wait
for
it
,
as
he
desired
,
outside
,
and
had
no
wish
to
hurry
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
went
outside
,
and
sat
down
in
the
shade
in
a
corner
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
sat
there
so
many
hours
,
that
the
shade
became
sunlight
,
and
the
sunlight
became
shade
again
,
and
still
I
sat
there
waiting
for
the
money
.
   
<EOS>
There
never
was
such
another
drunken
madman
in
that
line
of
business
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
was
well
known
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
having
sold
himself
to
the
devil
<EOS>
,
I
soon
understood
from
the
visits
he
received
from
the
boys
,
who
continually
came
skirmishing
about
the
shop
,
shouting
that
legend
,
and
calling
to
him
to
bring
out
his
gold
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
ai
n't
poor
,
you
know
,
Charley
,
as
you
pretend
.
 
<EOS>
Bring
out
your
gold
.
 
<EOS>
Bring
out
some
of
the
gold
you
sold
yourself
to
the
devil
for
.
 
<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
in
the
lining
of
the
mattress
,
Charley
.
 
<EOS>
Rip
it
open
and
let
's
have
some
!
"
 
<EOS>
This
,
and
many
offers
to
lend
him
a
knife
for
the
purpose
,
exasperated
him
to
such
a
degree
,
that
the
whole
day
was
a
succession
of
rushes
on
his
part
,
and
flights
on
the
part
of
the
boys
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
in
his
rage
he
would
take
me
for
one
of
them
,
and
come
at
me
,
mouthing
as
if
he
were
going
to
tear
me
in
pieces
;
then
,
remembering
me
,
just
in
time
,
would
dive
into
the
shop
,
and
lie
upon
his
bed
,
as
I
thought
from
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
yelling
in
a
frantic
way
,
to
his
own
windy
tune
,
the
"
Death
of
Nelson
"
;
with
an
Oh
!
<EOS>
before
every
line
,
and
innumerable
Goroos
interspersed
.
<EOS>
As
if
this
were
not
bad
enough
for
me
,
the
boys
,
connecting
me
with
the
establishment
,
on
account
of
the
patience
and
perseverance
with
which
I
sat
outside
,
half
-
dressed
,
pelted
me
,
and
used
me
very
ill
all
day
.
   
<EOS>
He
made
many
attempts
to
induce
me
to
consent
to
an
exchange
;
at
one
time
coming
out
with
a
fishing
-
rod
,
at
another
with
a
fiddle
,
at
another
with
a
cocked
hat
,
at
another
with
a
flute
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
resisted
all
these
overtures
,
and
sat
there
in
desperation
;
each
time
asking
him
,
with
tears
in
my
eyes
,
for
my
money
or
my
jacket
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
began
to
pay
me
in
halfpence
at
a
time
;
and
was
full
two
hours
getting
by
easy
stages
to
a
shilling
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
eyes
and
limbs
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
then
cried
,
peeping
hideously
out
of
the
shop
,
after
a
long
pause
,
"
will
you
go
for
twopence
more
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
,
"
I
said
;
"
I
shall
be
starved
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
lungs
and
liver
,
will
you
go
for
threepence
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
go
for
nothing
,
if
I
could
,
"
I
said
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
want
the
money
badly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
go
-
roo
!
"
<EOS>
(
it
is
really
impossible
to
express
how
he
twisted
this
ejaculation
out
of
himself
,
as
he
peeped
round
<EOS>
the
door
-
post
at
me
,
showing
nothing
but
his
crafty
old
head
)
<EOS>
;
"
will
you
go
for
fourpence
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
so
faint
and
weary
that
I
closed
with
this
offer
;
and
taking
the
money
out
of
his
claw
,
not
without
trembling
,
went
away
more
hungry
and
thirsty
than
I
had
ever
been
,
a
little
before
sunset
.
<EOS>
But
at
an
expense
of
threepence
I
soon
refreshed
myself
completely
;
and
,
being
in
better
spirits
then
,
limped
seven
miles
upon
my
road
.
   
<EOS>
My
bed
at
night
was
under
another
haystack
,
where
I
rested
comfortably
,
after
having
washed
my
blistered
feet
in
a
stream
,
and
dressed
them
as
well
as
I
was
able
,
with
some
cool
leaves
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
took
the
road
again
next
morning
,
I
found
that
it
lay
through
a
succession
of
hop
-
grounds
and
orchards
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
sufficiently
late
in
the
year
for
the
orchards
to
be
ruddy
with
ripe
apples
;
and
in
a
few
places
the
hop
-
pickers
were
already
at
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
it
all
extremely
beautiful
,
and
made
up
my
mind
to
sleep
among
the
hops
that
night
:
imagining
some
cheerful
companionship
in
the
long
perspectives
of
poles
,
with
the
graceful
leaves
twining
round
them
.
   
<EOS>
The
trampers
were
worse
than
ever
that
day
,
and
inspired
me
with
a
dread
that
is
yet
quite
fresh
in
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
them
were
most
ferocious
-
looking
ruffians
,
who
stared
at
me
as
I
went
by
;
and
stopped
,
perhaps
,
and
called
after
me
to
come
back
and
speak
to
them
,
and
when
I
took
to
my
heels
,
stoned
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
one
young
fellow
---
a
tinker
,
I
suppose
,
from
his
wallet
and
brazier
---
who
had
a
woman
with
him
,
and
who
faced
about
and
stared
at
me
thus
;
and
then
roared
to
me
in
such
a
tremendous
voice
to
come
back
,
that
I
halted
and
looked
round
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
here
,
when
you
're
called
,
"
said
the
tinker
,
"
or
I
'll
rip
your
young
body
open
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
thought
it
best
to
go
back
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
drew
nearer
to
them
,
trying
to
propitiate
the
tinker
by
my
looks
,
I
observed
that
the
woman
had
a
black
eye
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
?
"
said
the
tinker
,
gripping
the
bosom
of
my
shirt
with
his
blackened
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
Dover
,
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
do
you
come
from
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
tinker
,
giving
his
hand
another
turn
in
my
shirt
,
to
hold
me
more
securely
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
come
from
London
,
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
lay
are
you
upon
?
"
asked
the
tinker
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
a
prig
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
N
-
no
,
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ai
n't
you
,
by
G
#
#
#
#
?
 
<EOS>
If
you
make
a
brag
of
your
honesty
to
me
,
"
said
the
tinker
,
"
I
'll
knock
your
brains
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
his
disengaged
hand
he
made
a
menace
of
striking
me
,
and
then
looked
at
me
from
head
to
foot
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
got
the
price
of
a
pint
of
beer
about
you
?
"
said
the
tinker
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
,
out
with
it
,
afore
I
take
it
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
should
certainly
have
produced
it
,
but
that
I
met
the
woman
's
look
,
and
saw
her
very
slightly
shake
her
head
,
and
form
"
No
!
"
<EOS>
with
her
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
poor
,
"
I
said
,
attempting
to
smile
,
"
and
have
got
no
money
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
do
you
mean
?
"
said
the
tinker
,
<EOS>
looking
so
sternly
at
me
,
that
I
almost
feared
he
saw
the
money
in
my
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
!
<EOS>
"
I
stammered
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
"
said
the
tinker
,
"
by
wearing
my
brother
's
silk
handkerchief
!
 
<EOS>
Give
it
over
here
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
had
mine
off
my
neck
in
a
moment
,
and
tossed
it
to
the
woman
.
   
<EOS>
The
woman
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
,
as
if
she
thought
this
a
joke
,
and
tossed
it
back
to
me
,
nodded
once
,
as
slightly
as
before
,
and
made
the
word
"
Go
!
"
<EOS>
with
her
lips
.
 
<EOS>
Before
I
could
obey
,
however
,
the
tinker
seized
the
handkerchief
out
of
my
hand
with
a
roughness
that
threw
me
away
like
a
feather
,
and
putting
it
loosely
round
his
own
neck
,
turned
upon
the
woman
with
an
oath
,
and
knocked
her
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
shall
forget
seeing
her
fall
backward
on
the
hard
road
,
and
lie
there
with
her
bonnet
tumbled
off
,
and
her
hair
all
whitened
in
the
dust
;
nor
,
when
I
looked
back
from
a
distance
,
seeing
her
sitting
on
the
pathway
,
which
was
a
bank
by
the
roadside
,
wiping
the
blood
from
her
face
with
a
corner
of
her
shawl
,
while
he
went
on
ahead
.
   
<EOS>
This
adventure
frightened
me
so
,
that
,
afterwards
,
when
I
saw
any
of
these
people
coming
,
I
turned
back
until
I
could
find
a
hiding
-
place
,
where
I
remained
until
they
had
gone
out
of
sight
;
which
happened
so
often
,
that
I
was
very
seriously
delayed
.
 
<EOS>
But
under
this
difficulty
,
as
under
all
the
other
difficulties
of
my
journey
,
I
seemed
to
be
sustained
and
led
on
by
my
fanciful
picture
of
my
mother
in
her
youth
,
before
I
came
into
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
It
always
kept
me
company
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
there
,
among
the
hops
,
when
I
lay
down
to
sleep
;
it
was
with
me
on
my
waking
in
the
morning
;
it
went
before
me
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
associated
it
,
ever
since
,
with
the
sunny
street
of
Canterbury
,
dozing
as
it
were
in
the
hot
light
;
and
with
the
sight
of
its
old
houses
and
gateways
,
and
the
stately
,
grey
Cathedral
,
with
the
rooks
sailing
round
the
towers
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
came
,
at
last
,
upon
the
bare
,
wide
downs
near
Dover
,
it
relieved
the
solitary
aspect
of
the
scene
with
hope
;
and
not
until
I
reached
that
first
great
aim
of
my
journey
,
and
actually
set
foot
in
the
town
itself
,
on
the
sixth
day
of
my
flight
,
did
it
desert
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
,
strange
to
say
,
when
I
stood
with
my
ragged
shoes
,
and
my
dusty
,
sunburnt
,
half
-
clothed
figure
,
in
the
place
so
long
desired
,
it
seemed
to
vanish
like
a
dream
,
and
to
leave
me
helpless
and
dispirited
.
   
<EOS>
I
inquired
about
my
aunt
among
the
boatmen
first
,
and
received
various
answers
.
 
<EOS>
One
said
she
lived
in
the
South
Foreland
Light
,
and
had
singed
her
whiskers
by
doing
so
;
another
,
that
she
was
made
fast
to
the
great
buoy
outside
the
harbour
,
and
could
only
be
visited
at
half
-
tide
;
a
third
,
that
she
was
locked
up
in
Maidstone
jail
for
child
-
stealing
;
a
fourth
,
that
she
was
seen
to
mount
a
broom
in
the
last
high
wind
,
and
make
direct
for
Calais
.
 
<EOS>
The
fly
-
drivers
,
among
whom
I
inquired
next
,
were
equally
jocose
and
equally
disrespectful
;
and
the
shopkeepers
,
not
liking
my
appearance
,
generally
replied
,
without
hearing
what
I
had
to
say
,
that
they
had
got
nothing
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
more
miserable
and
destitute
than
I
had
done
at
any
period
of
my
running
away
.
 
<EOS>
My
money
was
all
gone
,
I
had
nothing
left
to
dispose
of
;
I
was
hungry
,
thirsty
,
and
worn
out
;
and
seemed
as
distant
from
my
end
as
if
I
had
remained
in
London
.
   
<EOS>
The
morning
had
worn
away
in
these
inquiries
,
and
I
was
sitting
on
the
step
of
an
empty
shop
at
a
street
corner
,
near
the
market
-
place
,
deliberating
upon
wandering
towards
those
other
places
which
had
been
mentioned
,
when
a
fly
-
driver
,
coming
by
with
his
carriage
,
dropped
a
horsecloth
.
 
<EOS>
Something
good
-
natured
in
the
man
's
face
,
as
I
handed
it
up
,
encouraged
me
to
ask
him
if
he
could
tell
me
where
Miss
Trotwood
lived
;
though
I
had
asked
the
question
so
often
,
that
it
almost
died
upon
my
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trotwood
,
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
name
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
Old
lady
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
,
"
rather
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pretty
stiff
in
the
back
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
making
himself
upright
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
it
very
likely
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Carries
a
bag
?
"
<EOS>
said
he
---
"
bag
with
a
good
deal
of
room
in
it
---
is
gruffish
,
and
comes
down
upon
you
,
sharp
?
"
   
<EOS>
My
heart
sank
within
me
as
I
acknowledged
the
undoubted
accuracy
of
this
description
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
then
,
I
tell
you
what
,
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
go
up
there
,
"
pointing
with
his
whip
towards
the
heights
,
"
and
keep
right
on
till
you
come
to
some
houses
facing
the
sea
,
I
think
you
'll
hear
of
her
.
<EOS>
My
opinion
is
she
wo
n't
stand
anything
,
so
here
's
a
penny
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
accepted
the
gift
thankfully
,
and
bought
a
loaf
with
it
.
<EOS>
Dispatching
this
refreshment
by
the
way
,
I
went
in
the
direction
my
friend
had
indicated
,
and
walked
on
a
good
distance
without
coming
to
the
houses
he
had
mentioned
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
I
saw
some
before
me
;
and
approaching
them
,
went
into
a
little
shop
<EOS>
(
it
was
what
we
used
to
call
a
general
shop
,
at
home
)
,
and
inquired
if
they
could
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
where
Miss
Trotwood
lived
.
 
<EOS>
I
addressed
myself
to
a
man
behind
the
counter
,
who
was
weighing
some
rice
for
a
young
woman
;
but
the
latter
,
taking
the
inquiry
to
herself
,
turned
round
quickly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
mistress
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
with
her
,
boy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
,
"
I
replied
,
"
to
speak
to
her
,
if
you
please
.
"
   
"
To
beg
of
her
,
you
mean
,
"
retorted
the
damsel
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
I
said
,
"
indeed
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
suddenly
remembering
that
in
truth
I
came
for
no
other
purpose
,
I
held
my
peace
in
confusion
,
and
felt
my
face
burn
.
   
<EOS>
MY
aunt
's
handmaid
,
as
I
supposed
she
was
from
what
she
had
said
,
put
her
rice
in
a
little
basket
and
walked
out
of
the
shop
;
telling
me
that
I
could
follow
her
,
if
I
wanted
to
know
where
Miss
Trotwood
lived
.
 
<EOS>
I
needed
no
second
permission
;
though
I
was
by
this
time
in
such
a
state
of
consternation
and
agitation
,
that
my
legs
shook
under
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
followed
the
young
woman
,
and
we
soon
came
to
a
very
neat
little
cottage
with
cheerful
bow
-
windows
:
in
front
of
it
,
a
small
square
gravelled
court
or
garden
full
of
flowers
,
carefully
tended
,
and
smelling
deliciously
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
Miss
Trotwood
's
,
"
said
the
young
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
you
know
;
and
that
's
all
I
have
got
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
which
words
she
hurried
into
the
house
,
as
if
to
shake
off
the
responsibility
of
my
appearance
;
and
left
me
standing
at
the
garden
-
gate
,
looking
disconsolately
over
the
top
of
it
towards
the
parlour
window
,
where
a
muslin
curtain
partly
undrawn
in
the
middle
,
a
large
round
green
screen
or
fan
fastened
on
to
the
windowsill
,
a
small
table
,
and
a
great
chair
,
suggested
to
me
that
my
aunt
might
be
at
that
moment
seated
in
awful
state
.
   
<EOS>
My
shoes
were
by
this
time
in
a
woeful
condition
.
 
<EOS>
The
soles
had
shed
themselves
bit
by
bit
,
and
the
upper
leathers
had
broken
and
burst
until
the
very
shape
and
form
of
shoes
had
departed
from
them
.
 
<EOS>
My
hat
(
which
had
served
me
for
a
night
-
cap
,
too
)
was
so
crushed
and
bent
,
that
no
old
battered
handleless
saucepan
on
a
dunghill
need
have
been
ashamed
to
vie
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
shirt
and
trousers
,
stained
with
heat
,
dew
,
grass
,
and
the
Kentish
soil
on
which
I
had
slept
---
and
torn
besides
---
might
have
frightened
the
birds
from
my
aunt
's
garden
,
as
I
stood
at
the
gate
.
 
<EOS>
My
hair
had
known
no
comb
or
brush
since
I
left
London
.
 
<EOS>
My
face
,
neck
,
and
hands
,
from
unaccustomed
exposure
to
the
air
and
sun
,
were
burnt
to
a
berry
-
brown
.
 
<EOS>
From
head
to
foot
I
was
powdered
almost
as
white
with
chalk
and
dust
,
as
if
I
had
come
out
of
a
lime
-
kiln
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
plight
,
and
with
a
strong
consciousness
of
it
,
I
waited
to
introduce
myself
to
,
and
make
my
first
impression
on
,
my
formidable
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
The
unbroken
stillness
of
the
parlour
window
leading
me
to
infer
,
after
a
while
,
that
she
was
not
there
,
I
lifted
up
my
eyes
to
the
window
above
it
,
where
I
saw
a
florid
,
pleasant
-
looking
gentleman
,
with
a
grey
head
,
who
shut
up
one
eye
in
a
grotesque
manner
,
nodded
his
head
at
me
several
times
,
shook
it
at
me
as
often
,
laughed
,
and
went
away
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
been
discomposed
enough
before
;
but
I
was
so
much
the
more
discomposed
by
this
unexpected
behaviour
,
that
I
was
on
the
point
of
slinking
off
,
to
think
how
I
had
best
proceed
,
when
there
came
out
of
the
house
a
lady
with
her
handkerchief
tied
over
her
cap
,
and
a
pair
of
gardening
gloves
on
her
hands
,
wearing
a
gardening
pocket
like
a
toll
-
man
's
apron
,
and
carrying
a
great
knife
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
her
immediately
to
be
Miss
Betsey
,
for
she
came
stalking
out
of
the
house
exactly
as
my
poor
mother
had
so
often
described
her
stalking
up
our
garden
at
Blunderstone
Rookery
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
away
!
"
said
Miss
Betsey
,
shaking
her
head
,
and
making
a
distant
chop
in
the
air
with
her
knife
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
along
!
 
<EOS>
No
boys
here
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
watched
her
,
with
my
heart
at
my
lips
,
as
she
marched
to
a
corner
of
her
garden
,
and
stooped
to
dig
up
some
little
root
there
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
without
a
scrap
of
courage
,
but
with
a
great
deal
of
desperation
,
I
went
softly
in
and
stood
beside
her
,
touching
her
with
my
finger
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
ma'am
,
"
I
began
.
   
<EOS>
She
started
and
looked
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
EH
?
"
exclaimed
Miss
Betsey
,
in
a
tone
of
amazement
<EOS>
I
have
never
heard
approached
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
aunt
,
I
am
your
nephew
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lord
!
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
And
sat
flat
down
in
the
garden
-
path
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
David
Copperfield
,
of
Blunderstone
,
in
Suffolk
---
where
you
came
,
on
the
night
when
I
was
born
,
and
saw
my
dear
mama
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
very
unhappy
since
she
died
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
slighted
,
and
taught
nothing
,
and
thrown
upon
myself
,
and
put
to
work
not
fit
for
me
.
<EOS>
It
made
me
run
away
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
robbed
at
first
setting
out
,
and
have
walked
all
the
way
,
and
have
never
slept
in
a
bed
since
I
began
the
journey
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
my
self
-
support
gave
way
all
at
once
;
and
with
a
movement
of
my
hands
,
intended
to
show
her
my
ragged
state
,
and
call
it
to
witness
that
I
had
suffered
something
,
I
broke
into
a
passion
of
crying
,
which
I
suppose
had
been
pent
up
within
me
all
the
week
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
with
every
sort
of
expression
but
wonder
discharged
from
her
countenance
,
sat
on
the
gravel
,
staring
at
me
,
until
I
began
to
cry
;
when
she
got
up
in
a
great
hurry
,
collared
me
,
and
took
me
into
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
Her
first
proceeding
<EOS>
there
was
to
unlock
a
tall
press
,
bring
out
several
bottles
,
and
pour
some
of
the
contents
of
each
into
my
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
they
must
have
been
taken
out
at
random
,
for
I
am
sure
I
tasted
aniseed
water
,
anchovy
sauce
,
and
salad
dressing
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
administered
these
restoratives
,
as
I
was
still
quite
hysterical
,
and
unable
to
control
my
sobs
,
she
put
me
on
the
sofa
,
with
a
shawl
under
my
head
,
and
the
handkerchief
from
her
own
head
under
my
feet
,
lest
I
should
sully
the
cover
;
and
then
,
sitting
herself
down
behind
the
green
fan
or
screen
I
have
already
mentioned
,
so
that
I
could
not
see
her
face
,
ejaculated
at
intervals
,
"
Mercy
on
us
!
"
<EOS>
letting
those
exclamations
off
like
minute
guns
.
   
<EOS>
After
a
time
she
rang
the
bell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Janet
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
when
her
servant
came
in
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
upstairs
,
give
my
compliments
to
Mr
Dick
,
and
say
I
wish
to
speak
to
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Janet
looked
a
little
surprised
to
see
me
lying
stiffly
on
the
sofa
<EOS>
(
I
was
afraid
to
move
lest
it
should
be
displeasing
to
my
aunt
)
,
but
went
on
her
errand
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
with
her
hands
behind
her
,
walked
up
and
down
the
room
,
until
the
gentleman
who
had
squinted
at
me
from
the
upper
window
came
in
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dick
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
do
n't
be
a
fool
,
because
nobody
can
be
more
discreet
than
you
can
,
when
you
choose
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
know
that
.
 
<EOS>
So
do
n't
be
a
fool
,
whatever
you
are
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
was
serious
immediately
,
and
looked
at
me
,
I
thought
,
as
if
he
would
entreat
me
to
say
nothing
about
the
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dick
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
you
have
heard
me
mention
David
Copperfield
?
 
<EOS>
Now
do
n't
pretend
not
to
have
a
memory
,
because
you
and
I
know
better
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
David
Copperfield
?
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
who
did
not
appear
to
me
to
remember
much
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
David
Copperfield
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
David
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
this
is
his
boy
---
his
son
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
be
as
like
his
father
as
it
's
possible
to
be
,
if
he
was
not
so
like
his
mother
,
too
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
His
son
?
"
said
Mr
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
"
David
's
son
?
 
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
   
"
Yes
,
"
pursued
my
aunt
,
"
and
he
has
done
a
pretty
piece
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
run
away
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
His
sister
,
Betsey
Trotwood
,
never
would
have
run
away
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
shook
her
head
firmly
,
confident
in
the
character
and
behaviour
of
the
girl
who
never
was
born
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
think
she
would
n't
have
run
away
?
"
said
Mr
Dick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
and
save
the
man
,
"
exclaimed
my
aunt
,
sharply
,
"
how
he
talks
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
I
know
she
would
n't
?
 
<EOS>
She
would
have
lived
with
her
god
-
mother
,
and
we
should
have
been
devoted
to
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
Where
,
in
the
name
of
wonder
,
should
his
sister
,
Betsey
Trotwood
,
have
run
from
,
or
to
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nowhere
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
"
returned
my
aunt
,
softened
by
the
reply
,
"
how
can
you
pretend
to
be
wool
-
gathering
,
Dick
,
when
you
are
as
sharp
as
a
surgeon
's
lancet
?
 
<EOS>
Now
,
here
you
see
young
David
Copperfield
,
and
the
question
I
put
to
you
is
,
what
shall
I
do
with
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
shall
you
do
with
him
?
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
feebly
,
scratching
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
do
with
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
with
a
grave
look
,
and
her
forefinger
held
up
.
<EOS>
"
Come
!
 
<EOS>
I
want
some
very
sound
advice
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
if
I
was
you
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
considering
,
and
looking
vacantly
at
me
,
"
I
should
---
<EOS>
"
The
contemplation
of
me
seemed
to
inspire
him
with
a
sudden
idea
,
and
he
added
,
briskly
,
"
I
should
wash
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Janet
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
turning
round
with
a
quiet
triumph
,
which
I
did
not
then
understand
,
"
Mr
Dick
sets
us
all
right
.
 
<EOS>
Heat
the
bath
!
"
   
<EOS>
Although
I
was
deeply
interested
in
this
dialogue
,
I
could
not
help
observing
my
aunt
,
Mr
Dick
,
and
Janet
,
while
it
was
in
progress
,
and
completing
a
survey
I
had
already
been
engaged
in
making
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
MY
aunt
was
a
tall
,
hard
-
featured
lady
,
but
by
no
means
ill
-
looking
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
inflexibility
in
her
face
,
in
her
voice
,
in
her
gait
and
carriage
,
amply
sufficient
to
account
for
the
effect
she
had
made
upon
a
gentle
creature
like
my
mother
;
but
her
features
were
rather
handsome
than
otherwise
,
though
unbending
and
austere
.
 
<EOS>
I
particularly
noticed
that
she
had
a
very
quick
,
bright
eye
.
 
<EOS>
Her
hair
,
which
was
grey
,
was
arranged
in
two
plain
divisions
,
under
what
I
believe
would
be
called
a
mob
-
cap
;
I
mean
a
cap
,
much
more
common
then
than
now
,
with
side
-
pieces
fastening
under
the
chin
.
 
<EOS>
Her
dress
was
of
a
lavender
colour
,
and
perfectly
neat
;
but
scantily
made
,
as
if
she
desired
to
be
as
little
encumbered
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
that
I
thought
it
,
in
form
,
more
like
a
riding
-
habit
with
the
superfluous
skirt
cut
off
,
than
anything
else
.
 
<EOS>
She
wore
at
her
side
a
gentleman
's
gold
watch
,
if
I
might
judge
from
its
size
and
make
,
with
an
appropriate
chain
and
seals
;
she
had
some
linen
at
her
throat
not
unlike
a
shirt
-
collar
,
and
things
at
her
wrists
like
little
shirt
-
wristbands
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
,
as
I
have
already
said
,
was
grey
-
headed
,
and
florid
<EOS>
:
I
should
have
said
all
about
him
,
in
saying
so
,
had
not
his
head
been
curiously
bowed
---
not
by
age
;
it
reminded
me
of
one
of
Mr
Creakle
's
boys
'
heads
after
a
beating
---
and
his
grey
eyes
prominent
and
large
,
with
a
strange
kind
of
watery
brightness
in
them
that
made
me
,
in
combination
with
his
vacant
manner
,
his
submission
to
my
aunt
,
and
his
childish
delight
when
she
praised
him
,
suspect
him
of
being
a
little
mad
;
though
,
if
he
were
mad
,
how
he
came
to
be
there
puzzled
me
extremely
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
like
any
other
ordinary
gentleman
,
in
a
loose
grey
morning
coat
and
waistcoat
,
and
white
trousers
;
and
had
his
watch
in
his
fob
,
and
his
money
in
his
pockets
:
which
he
rattled
as
if
he
were
very
proud
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
Janet
was
a
pretty
blooming
girl
,
of
about
nineteen
or
twenty
,
and
a
perfect
picture
of
neatness
.
 
<EOS>
Though
I
made
no
further
observation
of
her
at
the
moment
,
I
may
mention
here
what
I
did
not
discover
until
afterwards
,
namely
,
that
she
was
one
of
a
series
of
protegees
whom
my
aunt
had
taken
into
her
service
expressly
to
educate
in
a
renouncement
of
mankind
,
and
who
had
generally
completed
their
abjuration
by
marrying
the
baker
.
   
<EOS>
The
room
was
as
neat
as
Janet
or
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
laid
down
my
pen
,
a
moment
since
,
to
think
of
it
,
the
air
from
the
sea
came
blowing
in
again
,
mixed
with
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
;
and
I
saw
the
old
-
fashioned
furniture
brightly
rubbed
and
polished
,
my
aunt
's
inviolable
chair
and
table
by
the
round
green
fan
in
the
bow
-
window
,
the
drugget
-
covered
carpet
,
the
cat
,
the
kettle
-
holder
,
the
two
canaries
,
the
old
china
,
the
punchbowl
full
of
dried
rose
-
leaves
,
the
tall
press
guarding
all
sorts
of
bottles
and
pots
,
and
,
wonderfully
out
of
keeping
with
the
rest
,
my
dusty
self
upon
the
sofa
,
taking
note
of
everything
.
   
<EOS>
Janet
had
gone
away
to
get
the
bath
ready
,
when
my
aunt
,
to
my
great
alarm
,
became
in
one
moment
rigid
with
indignation
,
and
had
hardly
voice
to
cry
out
,
"
Janet
!
 
<EOS>
Donkeys
!
"
   
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
Janet
came
running
up
the
stairs
as
if
the
house
were
in
flames
,
darted
out
on
a
little
piece
of
green
in
front
,
and
warned
off
two
saddle
-
donkeys
,
lady
-
ridden
,
that
had
presumed
to
set
hoof
upon
it
;
while
my
aunt
,
rushing
out
of
the
house
,
seized
the
bridle
of
a
third
animal
laden
with
a
bestriding
child
,
turned
him
,
led
him
forth
from
those
sacred
precincts
,
and
boxed
the
ears
of
the
unlucky
urchin
in
attendance
who
had
dared
to
profane
that
hallowed
ground
.
   
<EOS>
To
this
hour
I
do
n't
know
whether
my
aunt
had
any
lawful
right
of
way
over
that
patch
of
green
;
but
she
had
settled
it
in
her
own
mind
that
she
had
,
and
it
was
all
the
same
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
one
great
outrage
of
her
life
,
demanding
to
be
constantly
avenged
,
was
the
passage
of
a
donkey
over
that
immaculate
spot
.
 
<EOS>
In
whatever
occupation
she
was
engaged
,
however
interesting
to
her
the
conversation
in
which
she
was
taking
part
,
a
donkey
turned
the
current
of
her
ideas
in
a
moment
,
and
she
was
upon
him
straight
.
<EOS>
Jugs
of
water
,
and
watering
-
pots
,
were
kept
in
secret
places
ready
to
be
discharged
on
the
offending
boys
;
sticks
were
laid
in
ambush
behind
the
door
;
sallies
were
made
at
all
hours
;
and
incessant
war
prevailed
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
this
was
an
agreeable
excitement
to
the
donkey
-
boys
;
or
perhaps
the
more
sagacious
of
the
donkeys
,
understanding
how
the
case
stood
,
delighted
with
constitutional
obstinacy
in
coming
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
know
that
there
were
three
alarms
before
the
bath
was
ready
;
and
that
on
the
occasion
of
the
last
and
most
desperate
of
all
,
I
saw
my
aunt
engage
,
single
-
handed
,
with
a
sandy
-
headed
lad
of
fifteen
,
and
bump
his
sandy
head
against
her
own
gate
,
before
he
seemed
to
comprehend
what
was
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
These
interruptions
were
of
the
more
ridiculous
to
me
,
because
she
was
giving
me
broth
out
of
a
table
-
spoon
at
the
time
(
having
firmly
persuaded
herself
that
I
was
actually
starving
,
and
must
receive
nourishment
at
first
in
very
small
quantities
)
,
and
,
while
my
mouth
was
yet
open
to
receive
the
spoon
,
she
would
put
it
back
into
the
basin
,
cry
"
Janet
!
 
Donkeys
!
"
and
go
out
to
the
assault

The
bath
was
a
great
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
began
to
be
sensible
of
acute
pains
in
my
limbs
from
lying
out
in
the
fields
,
and
was
now
so
tired
and
low
that
I
could
hardly
keep
myself
awake
for
five
minutes
together
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
had
bathed
,
they
(
I
mean
my
aunt
and
Janet
)
enrobed
me
in
a
shirt
and
a
pair
of
trousers
belonging
to
Mr
Dick
,
and
tied
me
up
in
two
or
three
great
shawls
.
 
<EOS>
What
sort
of
bundle
<EOS>
I
looked
like
,
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
,
but
I
felt
a
very
hot
one
.
<EOS>
Feeling
also
very
faint
and
drowsy
,
I
soon
lay
down
on
the
sofa
again
and
fell
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
a
dream
,
originating
in
the
fancy
which
had
occupied
my
mind
so
long
,
but
I
awoke
with
the
impression
that
my
aunt
had
come
and
bent
over
me
,
and
had
put
my
hair
away
from
my
face
,
and
laid
my
head
more
comfortably
,
and
had
then
stood
looking
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
words
,
"
Pretty
fellow
,
"
or
"
Poor
fellow
,
"
seemed
to
be
in
my
ears
,
too
;
but
certainly
there
was
nothing
else
,
when
I
awoke
,
to
lead
me
to
believe
that
they
had
been
uttered
by
my
aunt
,
who
sat
in
the
bow
-
window
gazing
at
the
sea
from
behind
the
green
fan
,
which
was
mounted
on
a
kind
of
swivel
,
and
turned
any
way
.
   
<EOS>
We
dined
soon
after
I
awoke
,
off
a
roast
fowl
and
a
pudding
;
I
sitting
at
table
,
not
unlike
a
trussed
bird
myself
,
and
moving
my
arms
with
considerable
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
my
aunt
had
swathed
me
up
,
I
made
no
complaint
of
being
inconvenienced
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
I
was
deeply
anxious
to
know
what
she
was
going
to
do
with
me
;
but
she
took
her
dinner
in
profound
silence
,
except
when
she
occasionally
fixed
her
eyes
on
me
sitting
opposite
,
and
said
,
"
Mercy
upon
us
!
"
which
did
not
by
any
means
relieve
my
anxiety
.
   
<EOS>
The
cloth
being
drawn
,
and
some
sherry
put
upon
the
table
(
of
which
I
had
a
glass
)
,
my
aunt
sent
up
for
Mr
Dick
again
,
who
joined
us
,
and
looked
as
wise
as
he
could
when
she
requested
him
to
attend
to
my
story
,
which
she
elicited
from
me
,
gradually
,
by
a
course
of
questions
.
 
<EOS>
During
my
recital
,
she
kept
her
eyes
on
Mr
Dick
,
who
I
thought
would
have
gone
to
sleep
but
for
that
,
and
who
,
whensoever
he
lapsed
into
a
smile
,
was
checked
by
a
frown
from
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Whatever
possessed
that
poor
unfortunate
Baby
,
that
she
must
go
and
be
married
again
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
when
I
had
finished
,
"
I
ca
n't
conceive
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
she
fell
in
love
with
her
second
husband
,
"
Mr
Dick
suggested
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fell
in
love
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
What
business
had
she
to
do
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
Mr
Dick
simpered
,
after
thinking
a
little
,
"
she
did
it
for
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pleasure
,
indeed
!
"
replied
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
mighty
pleasure
for
the
poor
Baby
to
fix
her
simple
faith
upon
any
dog
of
a
fellow
,
certain
to
ill
-
use
her
in
some
way
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
she
propose
to
herself
,
I
should
like
to
know
!
 
<EOS>
She
had
had
one
husband
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
seen
David
Copperfield
out
of
the
world
,
who
was
always
running
after
wax
dolls
from
his
cradle
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
got
a
baby
---
<EOS>
oh
,
there
were
a
pair
of
babies
when
she
gave
birth
to
this
child
sitting
here
,
that
Friday
night
!
<EOS>
---
and
what
more
did
she
want
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
secretly
shook
his
head
at
me
,
as
if
he
thought
there
was
no
getting
over
this
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
could
n't
even
have
a
baby
like
anybody
else
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
was
this
child
's
sister
,
Betsey
Trotwood
?
 
<EOS>
Not
forthcoming
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
tell
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
seemed
quite
frightened
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
little
man
of
a
doctor
,
with
his
head
on
one
side
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
Jellips
,
or
whatever
his
name
was
,
<EOS>
what
was
he
about
?
 
<EOS>
All
he
could
do
,
was
to
say
to
me
,
like
a
robin
redbreast
---
as
he
is
---
"
It
's
a
boy
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
boy
!
 
<EOS>
Yah
,
the
imbecility
of
the
whole
set
of
'
em
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
heartiness
of
the
ejaculation
startled
Mr
Dick
exceedingly
;
and
me
,
too
,
if
I
am
to
tell
the
truth
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
then
,
as
if
this
was
not
enough
,
and
she
had
not
stood
sufficiently
in
the
light
of
this
child
's
sister
,
Betsey
Trotwood
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
she
marries
a
second
time
---
goes
and
marries
a
Murderer
---
or
a
man
with
a
name
like
it
---
and
stands
in
THIS
child
's
light
!
 
<EOS>
And
the
natural
consequence
is
,
as
anybody
but
a
baby
might
have
foreseen
,
that
he
prowls
and
wanders
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
as
like
Cain
before
he
was
grown
up
,
as
he
can
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
looked
hard
at
me
,
as
if
to
identify
me
in
this
character
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
then
there
's
that
woman
with
the
Pagan
name
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
that
Peggotty
,
she
goes
and
gets
married
next
.
 
<EOS>
Because
she
has
not
seen
enough
of
the
evil
attending
such
things
,
she
goes
and
gets
married
next
,
as
the
child
relates
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
hope
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
shaking
her
head
,
"
that
her
husband
is
one
of
those
Poker
husbands
who
abound
in
the
newspapers
,
and
will
beat
her
well
with
one
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
to
hear
my
old
nurse
so
decried
,
and
made
the
subject
of
such
a
wish
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
my
aunt
that
indeed
she
was
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
That
Peggotty
was
the
best
,
the
truest
,
the
most
faithful
,
most
devoted
,
and
most
self
-
denying
friend
and
servant
in
the
world
;
who
had
ever
loved
me
dearly
,
who
had
ever
loved
my
mother
dearly
;
who
had
held
my
mother
's
dying
head
upon
her
arm
,
on
whose
face
my
mother
had
imprinted
her
last
grateful
kiss
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
remembrance
of
them
both
,
choking
me
,
I
broke
down
as
I
was
trying
to
say
that
her
home
was
my
home
,
and
that
all
she
had
was
mine
,
and
that
I
would
have
gone
to
her
for
shelter
,
but
for
her
humble
station
,
which
made
me
fear
that
I
might
bring
some
trouble
on
her
---
<EOS>
I
broke
down
,
I
say
,
as
I
was
trying
to
say
so
,
and
laid
my
face
in
my
hands
upon
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
the
child
is
right
to
stand
by
those
who
have
stood
by
him
---
Janet
!
 
<EOS>
Donkeys
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
thoroughly
believe
that
but
for
those
unfortunate
donkeys
,
we
should
have
come
to
a
good
understanding
;
for
my
aunt
had
laid
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
and
the
impulse
was
upon
me
,
thus
emboldened
,
to
embrace
her
and
beseech
her
protection
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
interruption
,
and
the
disorder
she
was
thrown
into
by
the
struggle
outside
,
put
an
end
to
all
softer
ideas
for
the
present
,
and
kept
my
aunt
indignantly
declaiming
to
Mr
Dick
about
her
determination
to
appeal
for
redress
to
the
laws
of
her
country
,
and
to
bring
actions
for
trespass
against
the
whole
donkey
proprietorship
of
Dover
,
until
tea
-
time
.
   
<EOS>
After
tea
,
we
sat
at
the
window
---
on
the
look
-
out
,
as
I
imagined
,
from
my
aunt
's
sharp
expression
of
face
,
for
more
invaders
---
until
dusk
,
when
Janet
set
candles
,
and
a
backgammon
-
board
,
on
the
table
,
and
pulled
down
the
blinds
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr
Dick
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
with
her
grave
look
,
and
her
forefinger
up
as
before
,
"
I
am
going
to
ask
you
another
question
.
<EOS>
Look
at
this
child
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
David
's
son
?
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
with
an
attentive
,
puzzled
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Exactly
so
,
"
returned
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
do
with
him
,
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
with
David
's
son
?
"
said
Mr
Dick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
replied
my
aunt
,
"
with
David
's
son
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Mr
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Do
with
---
I
should
put
him
to
bed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Janet
!
"
cried
my
aunt
,
with
the
same
complacent
triumph
that
I
had
remarked
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dick
sets
us
all
right
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
bed
is
ready
,
we
'll
take
him
up
to
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Janet
reporting
it
to
be
quite
ready
,
I
was
taken
up
to
it
;
kindly
,
but
in
some
sort
like
a
prisoner
;
my
aunt
going
in
front
and
Janet
bringing
up
the
rear
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
circumstance
which
gave
me
any
new
hope
,
was
my
aunt
's
stopping
on
the
stairs
to
inquire
about
a
smell
of
fire
that
was
prevalent
there
;
and
janet
's
replying
that
she
had
been
making
tinder
down
in
the
kitchen
,
of
my
old
shirt
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
were
no
other
clothes
in
my
room
than
the
odd
heap
of
things
I
wore
;
and
when
I
was
left
there
,
with
a
little
taper
which
my
aunt
forewarned
me
would
burn
exactly
five
minutes
<EOS>
,
I
heard
them
lock
my
door
on
the
outside
.
 
<EOS>
Turning
these
things
over
in
my
mind
<EOS>
I
deemed
it
possible
that
my
aunt
,
who
could
know
nothing
of
me
,
might
suspect
I
had
a
habit
of
running
away
,
and
took
precautions
,
on
that
account
,
to
have
me
in
safe
keeping
.
   
<EOS>
The
room
was
a
pleasant
one
,
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
overlooking
the
sea
,
on
which
the
moon
was
shining
brilliantly
.
 
<EOS>
After
I
had
said
my
prayers
,
and
the
candle
had
burnt
out
,
I
remember
how
I
still
sat
looking
at
the
moonlight
on
the
water
,
as
if
I
could
hope
to
read
my
fortune
in
it
,
as
in
a
bright
book
;
or
to
see
my
mother
with
her
child
,
coming
from
Heaven
,
along
that
shining
path
,
to
look
upon
me
as
she
had
looked
when
I
last
saw
her
sweet
face
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
how
the
solemn
feeling
with
which
at
length
I
turned
my
eyes
away
,
yielded
to
the
sensation
of
gratitude
and
rest
<EOS>
which
the
sight
of
the
white
-
curtained
bed
---
and
how
much
more
the
lying
softly
down
upon
it
,
nestling
in
the
snow
-
white
sheets
<EOS>
!
<EOS>
---
inspired
.
<EOS>
I
remember
how
I
thought
of
all
the
solitary
places
under
the
night
sky
where
I
had
slept
,
and
how
I
prayed
that
I
never
might
be
houseless
any
more
,
and
never
might
forget
the
houseless
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
how
I
seemed
to
float
,
then
,
down
the
melancholy
glory
of
that
track
upon
the
sea
,
away
into
the
world
of
dreams
.

Chapter

<EOS>
My
aunt
makes
up
her
mind
about
me
 
On
going
down
in
the
morning
,
I
found
my
aunt
musing
so
profoundly
over
the
breakfast
table
,
with
her
elbow
on
the
tray
,
that
the
contents
of
the
urn
had
overflowed
the
teapot
and
were
laying
the
whole
table
-
cloth
under
water
,
when
my
entrance
put
her
meditations
to
flight
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
sure
that
I
had
been
the
subject
of
her
reflections
,
and
was
more
than
ever
anxious
to
know
her
intentions
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
dared
not
express
my
anxiety
,
lest
it
should
give
her
offence
.
   
<EOS>
My
eyes
,
however
,
not
being
so
much
under
control
as
my
tongue
,
were
attracted
towards
my
aunt
very
often
during
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
could
look
at
her
for
a
few
moments
together
<EOS>
but
I
found
her
looking
at
me
---
in
an
odd
thoughtful
manner
,
as
if
I
were
an
immense
way
off
,
instead
of
being
on
the
other
side
of
the
small
round
table
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
finished
her
breakfast
,
my
aunt
very
deliberately
leaned
back
in
her
chair
,
knitted
her
brows
,
folded
her
arms
,
and
contemplated
me
at
her
leisure
,
with
such
a
fixedness
of
attention
that
I
was
quite
overpowered
by
embarrassment
.
 
<EOS>
Not
having
as
yet
finished
my
own
breakfast
,
I
attempted
to
hide
my
confusion
by
proceeding
with
it
;
but
my
knife
tumbled
over
my
fork
,
my
fork
tripped
up
my
knife
,
I
chipped
bits
of
bacon
a
surprising
height
into
the
air
instead
of
cutting
them
for
my
own
eating
,
and
choked
myself
with
my
tea
,
which
persisted
in
going
the
wrong
way
instead
of
the
right
one
,
until
I
gave
in
altogether
,
and
sat
blushing
under
my
aunt
's
close
scrutiny
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hallo
!
"
said
my
aunt
,
after
a
long
time
.
   
<EOS>
I
looked
up
,
and
met
her
sharp
bright
glance
respectfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
written
to
him
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
---
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
your
father
-
in
-
law
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
sent
him
a
letter
that
I
'll
trouble
him
to
attend
to
,
or
he
and
I
will
fall
out
,
I
can
tell
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
he
know
where
I
am
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
alarmed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
him
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
with
a
nod
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
---
be
---
given
up
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
faltered
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
think
what
I
shall
do
,
"
I
exclaimed
,
"
if
I
have
to
go
back
to
Mr
Murdstone
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
it
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
shaking
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
,
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
see
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
spirits
sank
under
these
words
,
and
I
became
very
downcast
and
heavy
of
heart
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
without
appearing
to
take
much
heed
of
me
,
put
on
a
coarse
apron
with
a
bib
,
which
she
took
out
of
the
press
;
washed
up
the
teacups
with
her
own
hands
;
and
,
when
everything
was
washed
and
set
in
the
tray
again
,
and
the
cloth
folded
and
put
on
the
top
of
the
whole
,
rang
for
Janet
to
remove
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
next
swept
up
the
crumbs
with
a
little
broom
(
putting
on
a
pair
of
gloves
first
)
,
until
there
did
not
appear
to
be
one
microscopic
speck
left
on
the
carpet
;
next
dusted
and
arranged
the
room
,
which
was
dusted
and
arranged
to
a
hair'sbreadth
already
.
<EOS>
When
all
these
tasks
were
performed
to
her
satisfaction
,
she
took
off
the
gloves
and
apron
,
folded
them
up
,
put
them
in
the
particular
corner
of
the
press
from
which
they
had
been
taken
,
brought
out
her
work
-
box
to
her
own
table
in
the
open
window
,
and
sat
down
,
with
the
green
fan
between
her
and
the
light
,
to
work
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
'd
go
upstairs
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
as
she
threaded
her
needle
,
"
and
give
my
compliments
to
Mr
Dick
,
and
I
'll
be
glad
to
know
how
he
gets
on
with
his
Memorial
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
rose
with
all
alacrity
,
to
acquit
myself
of
this
commission
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
eyeing
me
as
narrowly
as
she
had
eyed
the
needle
in
threading
it
,
"
you
think
Mr
Dick
a
short
name
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
was
rather
a
short
name
,
yesterday
,
"
I
confessed
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
to
suppose
that
he
has
n't
got
a
longer
name
,
if
he
chose
to
use
it
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
with
a
loftier
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
Babley
---
Mr
Richard
Babley
<EOS>
---
that
's
the
gentleman
's
true
name
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
suggest
,
with
a
modest
sense
of
my
youth
and
the
familiarity
I
had
been
already
guilty
of
<EOS>
,
that
I
had
better
give
him
the
full
benefit
of
that
name
,
when
my
aunt
went
on
to
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
But
do
n't
you
call
him
by
it
,
whatever
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
bear
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
a
peculiarity
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
Though
I
do
n't
know
that
it
's
much
of
a
peculiarity
,
either
;
for
he
has
been
ill
-
used
enough
,
by
some
that
bear
it
,
to
have
a
mortal
antipathy
for
it
,
Heaven
knows
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
is
his
name
here
,
and
everywhere
else
,
now
---
if
he
ever
went
anywhere
else
,
which
he
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
So
take
care
,
child
,
you
do
n't
call
him
anything
<EOS>
BUT
Mr
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
promised
to
obey
,
and
went
upstairs
with
my
message
;
thinking
,
as
I
went
,
that
if
Mr
Dick
had
been
working
at
his
Memorial
long
,
at
the
same
rate
as
I
had
seen
him
working
at
it
,
through
the
open
door
,
when
I
came
down
,
he
was
probably
getting
on
very
well
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
him
still
driving
at
it
with
a
long
pen
,
and
his
head
almost
laid
upon
the
paper
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
intent
upon
it
,
that
I
had
ample
leisure
to
observe
the
large
paper
kite
in
a
corner
,
the
confusion
of
bundles
of
manuscript
,
the
number
of
pens
,
and
,
above
all
,
the
quantity
of
ink
(
which
he
seemed
to
have
in
,
in
half
-
gallon
jars
by
the
dozen
)
,
before
he
observed
my
being
present
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Phoebus
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
laying
down
his
pen
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
does
the
world
go
?
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
lower
tone
,
"
I
should
n't
wish
it
to
be
mentioned
,
but
it
's
a
---
"
<EOS>
here
he
beckoned
to
me
,
and
put
his
lips
close
to
my
ear
---
<EOS>
"
it
's
a
mad
world
.
 
<EOS>
Mad
as
Bedlam
,
boy
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
taking
snuff
from
a
round
box
on
the
table
,
and
laughing
heartily
.
   
<EOS>
Without
presuming
to
give
my
opinion
on
this
question
,
I
delivered
my
message
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
in
answer
,
"
my
compliments
to
her
,
and
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
believe
I
have
made
a
start
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
made
a
start
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
passing
his
hand
among
his
grey
hair
,
and
casting
anything
but
a
confident
look
at
his
manuscript
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
to
school
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
I
answered
;
"
for
a
short
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
recollect
the
date
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
looking
earnestly
at
me
,
and
taking
up
his
pen
to
note
it
down
,
"
when
King
Charles
the
First
had
his
head
cut
off
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
said
I
believed
it
happened
in
the
year
sixteen
hundred
and
forty
-
nine
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
returned
Mr
Dick
,
scratching
his
ear
with
his
pen
,
and
looking
dubiously
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
the
books
say
;
but
I
do
n't
see
how
that
can
be
.
 
<EOS>
Because
,
if
it
was
so
long
ago
,
how
could
the
people
about
him
have
made
that
mistake
of
putting
some
of
the
trouble
out
of
his
head
,
after
it
was
taken
off
,
into
mine
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
very
much
surprised
by
the
inquiry
;
but
could
give
no
information
on
this
point
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
strange
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
with
a
despondent
look
upon
his
papers
,
and
with
his
hand
among
his
hair
again
,
"
that
I
never
can
get
that
quite
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
can
make
that
perfectly
clear
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
matter
,
no
matter
!
<EOS>
"
he
said
cheerfully
,
and
rousing
himself
,
"
there
's
time
enough
!
 
<EOS>
My
compliments
to
Miss
Trotwood
<EOS>
,
I
am
getting
on
very
well
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
going
away
,
when
he
directed
my
attention
to
the
kite
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
that
for
a
kite
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
   
<EOS>
I
answered
that
it
was
a
beautiful
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
think
it
must
have
been
as
much
as
seven
feet
high
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
made
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
go
and
fly
it
,
you
and
I
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
see
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
showed
me
that
it
was
covered
with
manuscript
,
very
closely
and
laboriously
written
;
but
so
plainly
,
that
as
I
looked
along
the
lines
,
I
thought
I
saw
some
allusion
to
King
Charles
<EOS>
the
First
's
head
again
,
in
one
or
two
places
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
plenty
of
string
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
"
and
when
it
flies
high
,
it
takes
the
facts
a
long
way
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
my
manner
of
diffusing
'em
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
where
they
may
come
down
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
according
to
circumstances
,
and
the
wind
,
and
so
forth
;
but
I
take
my
chance
of
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
face
was
so
very
mild
and
pleasant
,
and
had
something
so
reverend
in
it
,
though
it
was
hale
and
hearty
,
that
I
was
not
sure
but
that
he
was
having
a
good
-
humoured
jest
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
laughed
,
and
he
laughed
,
and
we
parted
the
best
friends
possible
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
child
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
when
I
went
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
of
Mr
Dick
,
this
morning
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
informed
her
that
he
sent
his
compliments
,
and
was
getting
on
very
well
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
him
?
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
some
shadowy
idea
of
endeavouring
to
evade
the
question
,
by
replying
that
I
thought
him
a
very
nice
gentleman
;
but
my
aunt
was
not
to
be
so
put
off
,
for
she
laid
her
work
down
in
her
lap
,
and
said
,
folding
her
hands
upon
it
:
   
"
<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Your
sister
Betsey
Trotwood
would
have
told
me
what
she
thought
of
anyone
,
directly
.
 
<EOS>
Be
as
like
your
sister
as
you
can
,
and
speak
out
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
---
is
Mr
Dick
<EOS>
---
I
ask
because
I
do
n't
know
,
aunt
---
is
he
at
all
out
of
his
mind
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
stammered
;
for
I
felt
I
was
on
dangerous
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
morsel
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
I
observed
faintly
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
there
is
anything
in
the
world
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
with
great
decision
and
force
of
manner
,
"
that
Mr
Dick
is
not
,
it
's
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
had
nothing
better
to
offer
,
than
another
timid
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
indeed
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
CALLED
mad
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
selfish
pleasure
in
saying
he
has
been
called
mad
,
or
I
should
not
have
had
the
benefit
of
his
society
and
advice
for
these
last
ten
years
and
upwards
---
in
fact
,
ever
since
your
sister
,
Betsey
Trotwood
,
disappointed
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
long
as
that
?
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
nice
people
they
were
,
who
had
the
audacity
to
call
him
mad
,
"
pursued
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dick
is
a
sort
of
distant
connexion
of
mine
---
it
does
n't
matter
how
;
I
need
n't
enter
into
that
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
had
n't
been
for
me
,
his
own
brother
would
have
shut
him
up
for
life
.
<EOS>
That
's
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
it
was
hypocritical
in
me
,
but
seeing
that
my
aunt
felt
strongly
on
the
subject
,
I
tried
to
look
as
if
I
felt
strongly
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
proud
fool
!
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
his
brother
was
a
little
eccentric
---
though
he
is
not
half
so
eccentric
as
a
good
many
people
---
he
did
n't
like
to
have
him
visible
about
his
house
,
and
sent
him
away
to
some
private
asylum
-
place
:
though
he
had
been
left
to
his
particular
care
by
their
deceased
father
,
who
thought
him
almost
a
natural
.
 
<EOS>
And
a
wise
man
he
must
have
been
to
think
so
!
<EOS>
Mad
himself
,
no
doubt
.
"
   
<EOS>
Again
,
as
my
aunt
looked
quite
convinced
,
I
endeavoured
to
look
quite
convinced
also
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
I
stepped
in
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
and
made
him
an
offer
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
Your
brother
's
sane
---
a
great
deal
more
sane
than
you
are
,
or
ever
will
be
,
it
is
to
be
hoped
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
have
his
little
income
,
and
come
and
live
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
afraid
of
him
,
I
am
not
proud
,
I
am
ready
to
take
care
of
him
,
and
shall
not
ill
-
treat
him
as
some
people
(
besides
the
asylum
-
folks
)
have
done
.
"
 
<EOS>
After
a
good
deal
of
squabbling
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
I
got
him
;
and
he
has
been
here
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
the
most
friendly
and
amenable
creature
in
existence
;
and
as
for
advice
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
But
nobody
knows
what
that
man
's
mind
is
,
except
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
smoothed
her
dress
and
shook
her
head
,
as
if
she
smoothed
defiance
of
the
whole
world
out
of
the
one
,
and
shook
it
out
of
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
had
a
favourite
sister
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
a
good
creature
,
and
very
kind
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
did
what
they
all
do
---
took
a
husband
.
<EOS>
And
HE
did
what
they
all
do
---
made
her
wretched
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
such
an
effect
upon
the
mind
of
Mr
Dick
(
that
's
not
madness
,
I
hope
!
)
<EOS>
that
,
combined
with
his
fear
of
his
brother
,
and
his
sense
of
his
unkindness
,
it
threw
him
into
a
fever
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
before
he
came
to
me
,
but
the
recollection
of
it
is
oppressive
to
him
even
now
.
 
<EOS>
Did
he
say
anything
to
you
about
King
Charles
the
First
,
child
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
my
aunt
,
rubbing
her
nose
as
if
she
were
a
little
vexed
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
his
allegorical
way
of
expressing
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
connects
his
illness
with
great
disturbance
and
agitation
,
naturally
,
and
that
's
the
figure
,
or
the
simile
,
or
whatever
it
's
called
,
which
he
chooses
to
use
.
 
<EOS>
And
why
should
n't
he
,
if
he
thinks
proper
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
said
:
"
Certainly
,
aunt
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
a
business
-
like
way
of
speaking
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
nor
a
worldly
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
aware
of
that
;
and
that
's
the
reason
why
I
insist
upon
it
,
that
there
sha
n't
be
a
word
about
it
in
his
Memorial
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
a
Memorial
about
his
own
history
that
he
is
writing
,
aunt
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
child
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
rubbing
her
nose
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
memorializing
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
or
the
Lord
Somebody
or
other
---
one
of
those
people
,
at
all
events
,
who
are
paid
to
be
memorialized
---
about
his
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
will
go
in
,
one
of
these
days
.
<EOS>
He
has
n't
been
able
to
draw
it
up
yet
,
without
introducing
that
mode
of
expressing
himself
;
but
it
do
n't
signify
;
it
keeps
him
employed
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
fact
,
I
found
out
afterwards
that
Mr
Dick
had
been
for
upwards
of
ten
years
endeavouring
to
keep
King
Charles
the
First
out
of
the
Memorial
;
but
he
had
been
constantly
getting
into
it
,
and
was
there
now
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
again
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
nobody
knows
what
that
man
's
mind
is
except
myself
;
and
he
's
the
most
amenable
and
friendly
creature
in
existence
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
likes
to
fly
a
kite
sometimes
,
what
of
that
!
<EOS>
Franklin
used
to
fly
a
kite
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
Quaker
,
or
something
of
that
sort
,
if
I
am
not
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
And
a
Quaker
flying
a
kite
is
a
much
more
ridiculous
object
than
anybody
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
If
I
could
have
supposed
that
my
aunt
had
recounted
these
particulars
for
my
especial
behoof
,
and
as
a
piece
of
confidence
in
me
,
I
should
have
felt
very
much
distinguished
,
and
should
have
augured
favourably
from
such
a
mark
of
her
good
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
could
hardly
help
observing
that
she
had
launched
into
them
,
chiefly
because
the
question
was
raised
in
her
own
mind
,
and
with
very
little
reference
to
me
,
though
she
had
addressed
herself
to
me
in
the
absence
of
anybody
else
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
I
must
say
that
the
generosity
of
her
championship
of
poor
harmless
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
,
not
only
inspired
my
young
breast
with
some
selfish
hope
for
myself
,
but
warmed
it
unselfishly
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
that
I
began
to
know
that
there
was
something
about
my
aunt
,
notwithstanding
her
many
eccentricities
and
odd
humours
,
to
be
honoured
and
trusted
in
.
 
<EOS>
Though
she
was
just
as
sharp
that
day
as
on
the
day
before
,
and
was
in
and
out
about
the
donkeys
just
as
often
,
and
was
thrown
into
a
tremendous
state
of
indignation
,
when
a
young
man
,
going
by
,
ogled
Janet
at
a
window
(
which
was
one
of
the
gravest
misdemeanours
that
could
be
committed
against
my
aunt
's
dignity
)
,
she
seemed
to
me
to
command
more
of
my
respect
,
if
not
less
of
my
fear
.
   
<EOS>
The
anxiety
I
underwent
,
in
the
interval
which
necessarily
elapsed
before
a
reply
could
be
received
to
her
letter
to
Mr
Murdstone
,
was
extreme
;
but
I
made
an
endeavour
to
suppress
it
,
and
to
be
as
agreeable
as
I
could
in
a
quiet
way
,
both
to
my
aunt
and
Mr
Dick
.
<EOS>
The
latter
and
I
would
have
gone
out
to
fly
the
great
kite
;
but
that
I
had
still
no
other
clothes
than
the
anything
but
ornamental
garments
with
which
I
had
been
decorated
on
the
first
day
,
and
which
confined
me
to
the
house
,
except
for
an
hour
after
dark
,
when
my
aunt
,
for
my
health
's
sake
,
paraded
me
up
and
down
on
the
cliff
outside
,
before
going
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
the
reply
from
Mr
Murdstone
came
,
and
my
aunt
informed
me
,
to
my
infinite
terror
,
that
he
was
coming
to
speak
to
her
herself
on
the
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
next
day
,
still
bundled
up
in
my
curious
habiliments
,
I
sat
counting
the
time
,
flushed
and
heated
by
the
conflict
of
sinking
hopes
and
rising
fears
within
me
;
and
waiting
to
be
startled
by
the
sight
of
the
gloomy
face
,
whose
non
-
arrival
startled
me
every
minute
.
   
<EOS>
MY
aunt
was
a
little
more
imperious
and
stern
than
usual
,
but
I
observed
no
other
token
of
her
preparing
herself
to
receive
the
visitor
so
much
dreaded
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
at
work
in
the
window
,
and
I
sat
by
,
with
my
thoughts
running
astray
on
all
possible
and
impossible
results
of
Mr
Murdstone
's
visit
,
until
pretty
late
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
Our
dinner
had
been
indefinitely
postponed
;
but
it
was
growing
so
late
,
that
my
aunt
had
ordered
it
to
be
got
ready
,
when
she
gave
a
sudden
alarm
of
donkeys
,
and
to
my
consternation
and
amazement
,
I
beheld
Miss
Murdstone
,
on
a
side
-
saddle
,
ride
deliberately
over
the
sacred
piece
of
green
,
and
stop
in
front
of
the
house
,
looking
about
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
along
with
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
my
aunt
,
shaking
her
head
and
her
fist
at
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
business
there
.
 
<EOS>
How
dare
you
trespass
?
 
<EOS>
Go
along
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
bold
-
faced
thing
!
"
   
<EOS>
MY
aunt
was
so
exasperated
by
the
coolness
with
which
Miss
Murdstone
looked
about
her
,
that
I
really
believe
she
was
motionless
,
and
unable
for
the
moment
to
dart
out
according
to
custom
.
 
<EOS>
I
seized
the
opportunity
to
inform
her
who
it
was
;
and
that
the
gentleman
now
coming
near
the
offender
(
for
the
way
up
was
very
steep
,
and
he
had
dropped
behind
)
,
was
Mr
Murdstone
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
who
it
is
!
"
cried
my
aunt
,
still
shaking
her
head
and
gesticulating
anything
<EOS>
but
welcome
from
the
bow
-
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
be
trespassed
upon
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
allow
it
.
 
<EOS>
Go
away
!
 
<EOS>
Janet
,
turn
him
round
.
 
<EOS>
Lead
him
off
!
"
<EOS>
and
I
saw
,
from
behind
my
aunt
,
a
sort
of
hurried
battle
-
piece
,
in
which
the
donkey
stood
resisting
everybody
,
with
all
his
four
legs
planted
different
ways
,
while
Janet
tried
to
pull
him
round
by
the
bridle
,
Mr
Murdstone
tried
to
lead
him
on
,
Miss
Murdstone
struck
at
Janet
with
a
parasol
,
and
several
boys
,
who
had
come
to
see
the
engagement
,
shouted
vigorously
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
aunt
,
suddenly
descrying
among
them
the
young
malefactor
who
was
the
donkey
's
guardian
,
and
who
was
one
of
the
most
inveterate
offenders
against
her
,
though
hardly
in
his
teens
,
rushed
out
to
the
scene
of
action
,
pounced
upon
him
,
captured
him
,
dragged
him
,
with
his
jacket
over
his
head
,
and
<EOS>
his
heels
grinding
the
ground
,
into
the
garden
,
and
,
calling
upon
Janet
to
fetch
the
constables
and
justices
,
that
he
might
be
taken
,
tried
,
and
executed
on
the
spot
,
held
him
at
bay
there
.
 
<EOS>
This
part
of
the
business
,
however
,
did
not
last
long
;
for
the
young
rascal
,
being
expert
at
a
variety
of
feints
and
dodges
,
of
which
my
aunt
had
no
conception
,
soon
went
whooping
away
,
leaving
some
deep
impressions
of
his
nailed
boots
in
the
flower
-
beds
,
and
taking
his
donkey
in
triumph
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
,
during
the
latter
portion
of
the
contest
,
had
dismounted
,
and
was
now
waiting
with
her
brother
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
,
until
my
aunt
should
be
at
leisure
to
receive
them
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
a
little
ruffled
by
the
combat
,
marched
past
them
into
the
house
,
with
great
dignity
,
and
took
no
notice
of
their
presence
,
until
they
were
announced
by
Janet
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
go
away
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
trembling
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
!
"
 
<EOS>
With
which
she
pushed
me
into
a
corner
near
her
,
and
fenced
Me
in
with
a
chair
,
as
if
it
were
a
prison
or
a
bar
of
justice
.
 
<EOS>
This
position
I
continued
to
occupy
during
the
whole
interview
,
and
from
it
I
now
saw
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
enter
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
I
was
not
aware
at
first
to
whom
I
had
the
pleasure
of
objecting
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
allow
anybody
to
ride
over
that
turf
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
no
exceptions
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
allow
anybody
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
regulation
is
rather
awkward
to
strangers
,
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
!
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Murdstone
seemed
afraid
of
a
renewal
of
hostilities
,
and
interposing
began
:
   
"
Miss
Trotwood
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
observed
my
aunt
with
a
keen
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
Mr
Murdstone
who
married
the
widow
of
my
late
nephew
,
David
Copperfield
,
of
Blunderstone
Rookery
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Though
why
Rookery
,
I
do
n't
know
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
excuse
my
saying
,
sir
,
"
returned
my
aunt
,
"
that
I
think
it
would
have
been
a
much
better
and
happier
thing
if
you
had
left
that
poor
child
alone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
so
far
agree
with
what
Miss
Trotwood
has
remarked
,
"
observed
Miss
Murdstone
,
bridling
,
"
that
I
consider
our
lamented
Clara
to
have
been
,
in
all
essential
respects
,
a
mere
child
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
comfort
to
you
and
me
,
ma'am
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
who
are
getting
on
in
life
,
and
are
not
likely
to
be
made
unhappy
by
our
personal
attractions
,
that
nobody
can
say
the
same
of
us
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
!
<EOS>
"
returned
Miss
Murdstone
,
though
,
I
thought
,
not
with
a
very
ready
or
gracious
assent
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
it
certainly
might
have
been
,
as
you
say
,
a
better
and
happier
thing
for
my
brother
if
he
had
never
entered
into
such
a
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
always
been
of
that
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
you
have
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Janet
,
"
ringing
the
bell
,
"
my
compliments
to
Mr
Dick
,
and
beg
him
to
come
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
Until
he
came
,
my
aunt
sat
perfectly
upright
and
stiff
,
frowning
at
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
came
,
my
aunt
performed
the
ceremony
of
introduction
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
An
old
and
intimate
friend
.
 
<EOS>
On
whose
judgement
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
with
emphasis
,
as
an
admonition
to
Mr
Dick
,
who
was
biting
his
forefinger
and
looking
rather
foolish
,
"
I
rely
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
took
his
finger
out
of
his
mouth
,
on
this
hint
,
and
stood
among
the
group
,
with
a
grave
and
attentive
expression
of
face
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
inclined
her
head
to
Mr
Murdstone
,
who
went
on
:
   
"
Miss
Trotwood
:
on
the
receipt
of
your
letter
,
I
considered
it
an
act
of
greater
justice
to
myself
,
and
perhaps
of
more
respect
to
you
---
"
   
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
still
eyeing
him
keenly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
mind
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
answer
it
in
person
,
however
inconvenient
the
journey
,
"
pursued
Mr
Murdstone
,
"
rather
than
by
letter
.
 
<EOS>
This
unhappy
boy
who
has
run
away
from
his
friends
and
his
occupation
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
And
whose
appearance
,
"
interposed
his
sister
,
directing
general
attention
to
me
in
my
indefinable
costume
,
"
is
perfectly
scandalous
and
disgraceful
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Jane
Murdstone
,
"
said
her
brother
,
"
have
the
goodness
not
to
interrupt
me
.
 
<EOS>
This
unhappy
boy
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
has
been
the
occasion
of
much
domestic
trouble
and
uneasiness
;
both
during
the
lifetime
of
my
late
dear
wife
,
and
since
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
sullen
,
rebellious
spirit
;
a
violent
temper
;
and
an
untoward
,
intractable
disposition

<EOS>
Both
my
sister
and
myself
have
endeavoured
to
correct
his
vices
,
but
ineffectually
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
felt
<EOS>
---
we
both
have
felt
,
I
may
say
;
my
sister
being
fully
in
my
confidence
---
that
it
is
right
you
should
receive
this
grave
and
dispassionate
assurance
from
our
lips
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
can
hardly
be
necessary
for
me
to
confirm
anything
stated
by
my
brother
,
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
beg
to
observe
,
that
,
of
all
the
boys
in
the
world
,
I
believe
this
is
the
worst
boy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Strong
!
"
said
my
aunt
,
shortly
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
not
at
all
too
strong
for
the
facts

"
returned
Miss
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
my
own
opinions

"
resumed
Mr
Murdstone
,
whose
face
darkened
more
and
more
,
<EOS>
the
more
he
and
my
aunt
observed
each
other
,
which
they
did
very
narrowly
,
"
as
to
the
best
mode
of
bringing
him
up
;
they
are
founded
,
in
part
,
on
my
knowledge
of
him
,
and
in
part
on
my
knowledge
of
my
own
means
and
resources
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
responsible
for
them
to
myself
<EOS>
,
I
act
upon
them
,
and
I
say
no
more
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
enough
that
I
place
this
boy
under
the
eye
of
a
friend
of
my
own
,
in
a
respectable
business
;
that
it
does
not
please
him
;
that
he
runs
away
from
it
;
makes
himself
a
common
vagabond
about
the
country
;
and
comes
here
,
in
rags
,
to
appeal
to
you
,
Miss
Trotwood
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
set
before
you
,
honourably
,
the
exact
consequences
---
so
far
as
they
are
within
my
knowledge
---
of
your
abetting
him
in
this
appeal
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
about
the
respectable
business
first
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
he
had
been
your
own
boy
,
you
would
have
put
him
to
it
,
just
the
same
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
he
had
been
my
brother
's
own
boy
,
"
returned
Miss
Murdstone
,
striking
in
,
"
his
character
,
I
trust
,
would
have
been
altogether
different
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Or
if
the
poor
child
,
his
mother
,
had
been
alive
,
he
would
still
have
gone
into
the
respectable
business
,
would
he
?
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
,
with
an
inclination
of
his
head
,
"
that
Clara
would
have
disputed
nothing
which
myself
and
my
sister
Jane
Murdstone
were
agreed
was
for
the
best
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
confirmed
this
with
an
audible
murmur
.
   
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Unfortunate
baby
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
,
who
had
been
rattling
his
money
all
this
time
,
was
rattling
it
so
loudly
now
,
that
my
aunt
felt
it
necessary
to
check
him
with
a
look
,
before
saying
:
   
"
The
poor
child
's
annuity
died
with
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Died
with
her
,
"
replied
Mr
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
there
was
no
settlement
of
the
little
property
---
the
house
and
garden
---
the
what's
-
its
-
name
Rookery
without
any
rooks
in
it
---
upon
her
boy
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
had
been
left
to
her
,
unconditionally
,
by
her
first
husband
,
"
Mr
Murdstone
began
,
when
my
aunt
caught
him
up
with
the
greatest
irascibility
and
impatience
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
Lord
,
man
,
there
's
no
occasion
to
say
that
.
 
<EOS>
Left
to
her
unconditionally
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
see
David
Copperfield
looking
forward
to
any
condition
of
any
sort
or
kind
,
though
it
stared
him
point
-
blank
in
the
face
!
 
<EOS>
Of
course
it
was
left
to
her
unconditionally
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
she
married
again
---
when
she
took
that
most
disastrous
step
of
marrying
you
,
in
short
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
to
be
plain
<EOS>
---
did
no
one
put
in
a
word
for
the
boy
at
that
time
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
late
wife
loved
her
second
husband
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Murdstone
,
"
and
trusted
implicitly
in
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
late
wife
,
sir
,
was
a
most
unworldly
,
most
unhappy
,
most
unfortunate
baby
,
"
returned
my
aunt
,
shaking
her
head
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
's
what
she
was
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
what
have
you
got
to
say
next
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Merely
this
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
"
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
here
to
take
David
back
---
to
take
him
back
unconditionally
,
to
dispose
of
him
as
I
think
proper
,
and
to
deal
with
him
as
I
think
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
here
to
make
any
promise
,
or
give
any
pledge
to
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
possibly
have
some
idea
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
of
abetting
him
in
his
running
away
,
and
in
his
complaints
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Your
manner
,
which
I
must
say
does
not
seem
intended
to
propitiate
,
induces
me
to
think
it
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
must
caution
you
that
if
you
abet
him
once
,
you
abet
him
for
good
and
all
;
if
you
step
in
between
him
and
me
,
now
,
you
must
step
in
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
trifle
,
or
be
trifled
with
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
here
,
for
the
first
and
last
time
,
to
take
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
Is
he
ready
to
go
?
 
<EOS>
If
he
is
not
---
and
you
tell
me
he
is
not
;
on
any
pretence
;
it
is
indifferent
to
me
<EOS>
what
---
my
doors
are
shut
against
him
henceforth
,
and
yours
,
I
take
it
for
granted
,
are
open
to
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
To
this
address
,
my
aunt
had
listened
with
the
closest
attention
,
sitting
perfectly
upright
,
with
her
hands
folded
on
one
knee
,
and
looking
grimly
on
the
speaker
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
finished
,
she
turned
her
eyes
so
as
to
command
Miss
Murdstone
,
without
otherwise
disturbing
her
attitude
,
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Well
,
ma'am
,
have
YOU
got
anything
to
remark
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
"
<EOS>
all
that
I
could
say
has
been
so
well
said
by
my
brother
,
and
all
that
I
know
to
be
the
fact
has
been
so
plainly
stated
by
him
,
that
I
have
nothing
to
add
except
my
thanks
for
your
politeness
.
 
<EOS>
For
your
very
great
politeness
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
;
with
an
irony
which
no
more
affected
my
aunt
,
than
it
discomposed
the
cannon
I
had
slept
by
at
Chatham
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
does
the
boy
say
?
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
ready
to
go
,
David
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
answered
no
,
and
entreated
her
not
to
let
me
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
that
neither
Mr
nor
Miss
Murdstone
had
ever
liked
me
,
or
had
ever
been
kind
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
That
they
had
made
my
mama
,
who
always
loved
me
dearly
,
unhappy
about
me
,
and
that
I
knew
it
well
,
and
that
Peggotty
knew
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
that
I
had
been
more
miserable
than
I
thought
anybody
could
believe
,
who
only
knew
how
young
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
begged
and
prayed
my
aunt
<EOS>
---
I
forget
in
what
terms
now
,
but
I
remember
that
they
affected
me
very
much
then
---
to
befriend
and
protect
me
,
for
my
father
's
sake
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dick
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
what
shall
I
do
with
this
child
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
considered
,
hesitated
,
brightened
,
and
rejoined
,
"
Have
him
measured
for
a
suit
of
clothes
directly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dick
,
"
said
my
aunt
triumphantly
,
"
give
me
your
hand
,
for
your
common
sense
is
invaluable
.
"
 
<EOS>
Having
shaken
it
with
great
cordiality
,
she
pulled
me
towards
her
and
said
to
Mr
Murdstone
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
go
when
you
like
;
I
'll
take
my
chance
with
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
's
all
you
say
he
is
,
at
least
I
can
do
as
much
for
him
then
,
as
you
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Trotwood
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Murdstone
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
as
he
rose
,
"
if
you
were
a
gentleman
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
Bah
!
 
<EOS>
Stuff
and
nonsense
!
<EOS>
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
exquisitely
polite
!
"
exclaimed
Miss
Murdstone
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"
Overpowering
,
really
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
the
sister
,
and
continuing
to
address
the
brother
,
and
to
shake
her
head
at
him
with
infinite
expression
,
"
what
kind
of
life
you
must
have
led
that
poor
,
unhappy
,
misdirected
baby
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
do
n't
know
what
a
woeful
day
it
was
for
the
soft
little
creature
when
you
first
came
in
her
way
---
smirking
and
making
great
eyes
at
her
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
as
if
you
could
n't
say
boh
!
<EOS>
to
a
goose
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
anything
so
elegant
!
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
I
ca
n't
understand
you
as
well
as
if
I
had
seen
you
,
"
pursued
my
aunt
,
"
now
that
I
DO
see
and
hear
you
---
which
,
I
tell
you
candidly
,
is
anything
but
a
pleasure
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
bless
us
!
<EOS>
who
so
smooth
and
silky
as
Mr
Murdstone
at
first
!
 
<EOS>
The
poor
,
benighted
innocent
had
never
seen
such
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
made
of
sweetness
.
 
<EOS>
He
worshipped
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
doted
on
her
boy
---
tenderly
doted
on
him
!
 
<EOS>
He
was
to
be
another
father
to
him
,
and
they
were
all
to
live
together
in
a
garden
of
roses
,
were
n't
they
?
 
<EOS>
Ugh
!
 
<EOS>
Get
along
with
you
,
do
!
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
anything
like
this
person
in
my
life
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Miss
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
you
had
made
sure
of
the
poor
little
fool
,
"
said
my
aunt
---
"
God
forgive
me
that
I
should
call
her
so
,
and
she
gone
where
YOU
wo
n't
go
in
a
hurry
---
because
you
had
not
done
wrong
enough
to
her
and
hers
,
you
must
begin
to
train
her
,
must
you
?
<EOS>
begin
to
break
her
,
like
a
poor
caged
bird
,
and
wear
her
deluded
life
away
,
in
teaching
her
to
sing
YOUR
notes
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
This
is
either
insanity
or
intoxication
,
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
in
a
perfect
agony
at
not
being
able
to
turn
the
current
of
my
aunt
's
address
towards
herself
;
"
and
my
suspicion
is
that
it
's
intoxication
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Betsey
,
without
taking
the
least
notice
of
the
interruption
,
continued
to
address
herself
to
Mr
Murdstone
as
if
there
had
been
no
such
thing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Murdstone
,
"
she
said
,
shaking
her
finger
at
him
,
"
you
were
a
tyrant
to
the
simple
baby
,
and
you
broke
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
loving
baby
---
<EOS>
I
know
that
;
I
knew
it
,
years
before
you
ever
saw
her
---
and
through
the
best
part
of
her
weakness
you
gave
her
the
wounds
she
died
of
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
the
truth
for
your
comfort
,
however
you
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
and
your
instruments
may
make
the
most
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Allow
me
to
inquire
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
"
interposed
Miss
Murdstone
,
"
whom
you
are
pleased
to
call
,
in
a
choice
of
words
in
which
I
am
not
experienced
,
my
brother
's
instruments
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
clear
enough
,
as
I
have
told
you
,
years
before
YOU
ever
saw
her
---
and
why
,
in
the
mysterious
dispensations
of
Providence
,
you
ever
did
see
her
,
is
more
than
humanity
can
comprehend
---
it
was
clear
enough
that
the
poor
soft
little
thing
would
marry
somebody
,
at
some
time
or
other
;
but
I
did
hope
it
would
n't
have
been
as
bad
as
it
has
turned
out
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
the
time
,
Mr
Murdstone
,
when
she
gave
birth
to
her
boy
here
,
"
said
my
aunt
;
"
to
the
poor
child
you
sometimes
tormented
her
through
afterwards
,
which
is
a
disagreeable
remembrance
and
makes
the
sight
of
him
odious
now
.
 
<EOS>
Aye
,
aye
!
<EOS>
you
need
n't
wince
!
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
's
true
without
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
stood
by
the
door
,
all
this
while
,
observant
of
her
with
a
smile
upon
his
face
,
though
his
black
eyebrows
were
heavily
contracted
.
 
<EOS>
I
remarked
now
,
that
,
though
the
smile
was
on
his
face
still
,
his
colour
had
gone
in
a
moment
,
and
he
seemed
to
breathe
as
if
he
had
been
running
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
day
,
sir
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
and
good
-
bye
!
 
<EOS>
Good
day
to
you
,
too
,
ma'am
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
turning
suddenly
upon
his
sister
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
you
ride
a
donkey
over
my
green
again
,
and
as
sure
as
you
have
a
head
upon
your
shoulders
,
I
'll
knock
your
bonnet
off
,
and
tread
upon
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
would
require
a
painter
,
and
no
common
painter
too
,
to
depict
my
aunt
's
face
as
she
delivered
herself
of
this
very
unexpected
sentiment
,
and
Miss
Murdstone
's
face
as
she
heard
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
manner
of
the
speech
,
no
less
than
the
matter
,
was
so
fiery
,
that
Miss
Murdstone
,
without
a
word
in
answer
,
discreetly
put
her
arm
through
her
brother
's
,
and
walked
haughtily
out
of
the
cottage
;
my
aunt
remaining
in
the
window
looking
after
them
;
prepared
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
in
case
of
the
donkey
's
reappearance
,
to
carry
her
threat
into
instant
execution
.
   
<EOS>
No
attempt
at
defiance
being
made
,
however
,
her
face
gradually
relaxed
,
and
became
so
pleasant
,
that
I
was
emboldened
to
kiss
and
thank
her
;
which
I
did
with
great
heartiness
,
and
with
both
my
arms
clasped
round
her
neck
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
shook
hands
with
Mr
Dick
,
who
shook
hands
with
me
a
great
many
times
,
and
hailed
this
happy
close
of
the
proceedings
with
repeated
bursts
of
laughter
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
consider
yourself
guardian
,
jointly
with
me
,
of
this
child
,
Mr
Dick
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
delighted
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
"
to
be
the
guardian
of
David
's
son
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
returned
my
aunt
,
"
that
's
settled
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
thinking
,
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
Mr
Dick
,
that
I
might
call
him
Trotwood
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
certainly
.
 
<EOS>
Call
him
Trotwood
,
certainly
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
"
David
's
son
's
Trotwood
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Trotwood
Copperfield
,
you
mean
,
"
returned
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Trotwood
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
a
little
abashed
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
took
so
kindly
to
the
notion
,
that
some
ready
-
made
clothes
,
which
were
purchased
for
me
that
afternoon
,
were
marked
"
Trotwood
Copperfield
"
,
in
her
own
handwriting
,
and
in
indelible
marking
-
ink
,
before
I
put
them
on
;
and
it
was
settled
that
all
the
other
clothes
which
were
ordered
to
be
made
for
me
(
a
complete
outfit
was
bespoke
that
afternoon
)
<EOS>
should
be
marked
in
the
same
way
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
I
began
my
new
life
,
in
a
new
name
,
and
with
everything
new
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
Now
that
the
state
of
doubt
was
over
<EOS>
,
I
felt
,
for
many
days
,
like
one
in
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
thought
that
I
had
a
curious
couple
of
guardians
,
in
my
aunt
and
Mr
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
thought
of
anything
about
myself
,
distinctly
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
things
clearest
in
my
mind
were
,
that
a
remoteness
had
come
upon
the
old
Blunderstone
life
---
which
seemed
to
lie
in
the
haze
of
an
immeasurable
distance
;
and
that
a
curtain
had
for
ever
fallen
on
my
life
at
Murdstone
and
Grinby
's
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
has
ever
raised
that
curtain
since
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
lifted
it
for
a
moment
,
even
in
this
narrative
,
with
a
reluctant
hand
,
and
dropped
it
gladly
.
 
<EOS>
The
remembrance
of
that
life
is
fraught
with
so
much
pain
to
me
,
with
so
much
mental
suffering
and
want
of
hope
,
that
I
have
never
had
the
courage
even
to
examine
how
long
I
was
doomed
to
lead
it
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
it
lasted
for
a
year
,
or
more
,
or
less
,
I
do
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
know
that
it
was
,
and
ceased
to
be
;
and
that
I
have
written
,
and
there
I
leave
it
.
      
<EOS>
Chapter
15
.
<EOS>
I
make
another
beginning
 
Mr
Dick
<EOS>
and
I
soon
became
the
best
of
friends
,
and
very
often
,
when
his
day
's
work
was
done
,
went
out
together
to
fly
the
great
kite
.
 
<EOS>
Every
day
of
his
life
he
had
a
long
sitting
at
the
Memorial
,
which
never
made
the
least
progress
,
however
hard
he
laboured
,
for
King
Charles
the
First
always
strayed
into
it
,
sooner
or
later
,
and
then
it
was
thrown
aside
,
and
another
one
begun
.
 
<EOS>
The
patience
and
hope
with
which
he
bore
these
perpetual
disappointments
,
the
mild
perception
he
had
that
there
was
something
wrong
about
King
Charles
<EOS>
the
First
,
the
feeble
efforts
he
made
to
keep
him
out
,
and
the
certainty
with
which
he
came
in
,
and
tumbled
the
Memorial
out
of
all
shape
,
made
a
deep
impression
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
Mr
Dick
supposed
would
come
of
the
Memorial
<EOS>
,
if
it
were
completed
;
where
he
thought
it
was
to
go
,
or
what
he
thought
it
was
to
do
;
he
knew
no
more
than
anybody
else
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
at
all
necessary
that
he
should
trouble
himself
with
such
questions
,
<EOS>
for
if
anything
were
certain
under
the
sun
,
it
was
certain
that
the
Memorial
never
would
be
finished
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
an
affecting
sight
<EOS>
,
I
used
to
think
,
to
see
him
with
the
kite
when
it
was
up
a
great
height
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
What
he
had
told
me
,
in
his
room
,
about
his
belief
in
its
disseminating
the
statements
pasted
on
it
,
which
were
nothing
but
old
leaves
of
abortive
Memorials
,
might
have
been
a
fancy
with
him
sometimes
;
but
not
when
he
was
out
,
looking
up
at
the
kite
in
the
sky
,
and
feeling
it
pull
and
tug
at
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
looked
so
serene
as
he
did
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
used
to
fancy
,
as
I
sat
by
him
of
an
evening
,
on
a
green
slope
,
and
saw
him
watch
the
kite
high
in
the
quiet
air
,
that
it
lifted
his
mind
out
of
its
confusion
,
and
bore
it
<EOS>
(
such
was
my
boyish
thought
)
into
the
skies
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
wound
the
string
in
and
it
came
lower
and
lower
down
out
of
the
beautiful
light
,
until
it
fluttered
to
the
ground
,
and
lay
there
like
a
dead
thing
,
he
seemed
to
wake
gradually
out
of
a
dream
;
and
I
remember
to
have
seen
him
take
it
up
,
and
look
about
him
in
a
lost
way
,
as
if
they
had
both
come
down
together
,
so
that
I
pitied
him
with
all
my
heart
.
   
<EOS>
While
I
advanced
in
friendship
and
intimacy
with
Mr
Dick
,
I
did
not
go
backward
in
the
favour
of
his
staunch
friend
,
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
so
kindly
to
me
,
that
,
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
,
she
shortened
my
adopted
name
of
Trotwood
into
Trot
;
and
even
encouraged
me
to
hope
,
that
if
I
went
on
as
I
had
begun
,
I
might
take
equal
rank
in
her
affections
with
my
sister
Betsey
Trotwood
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trot
,
"
said
my
aunt
one
evening
,
when
the
backgammon
-
board
was
placed
as
usual
for
herself
and
Mr
Dick
,
"
we
must
not
forget
your
education
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
my
only
subject
of
anxiety
,
and
I
felt
quite
delighted
by
her
referring
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Should
you
like
to
go
to
school
at
Canterbury
?
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
I
replied
that
I
should
like
it
very
much
,
as
it
was
so
near
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Should
you
like
to
go
tomorrow
?
"
   
<EOS>
Being
already
no
stranger
to
the
general
rapidity
of
my
aunt
's
evolutions
,
I
was
not
surprised
by
the
suddenness
of
the
proposal
,
and
said
:
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
,
"
said
my
aunt
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Janet
,
hire
the
grey
pony
and
chaise
tomorrow
morning
at
ten
o'clock
,
and
pack
up
Master
Trotwood
's
clothes
tonight
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
greatly
elated
by
these
orders
;
but
my
heart
smote
me
for
my
selfishness
,
when
I
witnessed
their
effect
on
Mr
Dick
,
who
was
so
low
-
spirited
at
the
prospect
of
our
separation
,
and
played
so
ill
in
consequence
,
that
my
aunt
,
after
giving
him
several
admonitory
raps
on
the
knuckles
with
her
dice
-
box
,
shut
up
the
board
,
and
declined
to
play
with
him
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
on
hearing
from
my
aunt
that
I
should
sometimes
come
over
on
a
Saturday
,
and
that
he
could
sometimes
come
and
see
me
on
a
Wednesday
<EOS>
,
he
revived
;
and
vowed
to
make
another
kite
for
those
occasions
,
of
proportions
greatly
surpassing
the
present
one
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
morning
he
was
downhearted
again
,
and
would
have
sustained
himself
by
giving
me
all
the
money
he
had
in
his
possession
,
gold
and
silver
too
,
if
my
aunt
had
not
interposed
,
and
limited
the
gift
to
five
shillings
,
which
,
at
his
earnest
petition
,
were
afterwards
increased
to
ten
.
 
<EOS>
We
parted
at
the
garden
-
gate
in
a
most
affectionate
manner
,
and
Mr
Dick
did
not
go
into
the
house
until
my
aunt
had
driven
me
out
of
sight
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
who
was
perfectly
indifferent
to
public
opinion
,
drove
the
grey
pony
through
Dover
in
a
masterly
manner
;
sitting
high
and
stiff
like
a
state
coachman
,
keeping
a
steady
eye
upon
him
wherever
he
went
,
and
making
a
point
of
not
letting
him
have
his
own
way
in
any
respect
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
came
into
the
country
road
,
she
permitted
him
to
relax
a
little
,
however
;
and
looking
at
me
down
in
a
valley
of
cushion
by
her
side
,
asked
me
whether
I
was
happy
?
   
<EOS>
"
Very
happy
indeed
,
thank
you
,
aunt
,
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
much
gratified
;
and
both
her
hands
being
occupied
,
patted
me
on
the
head
with
her
whip
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
a
large
school
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
going
to
Mr
Wickfield
's
first
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
he
keep
a
school
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Trot
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
keeps
an
office
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
asked
for
no
more
information
about
Mr
Wickfield
,
as
she
offered
none
,
and
we
conversed
on
other
subjects
until
we
came
to
Canterbury
,
where
,
as
it
was
market
-
day
,
my
aunt
had
a
great
opportunity
of
insinuating
the
grey
pony
among
carts
,
baskets
,
vegetables
,
and
huckster
's
goods
.
 
<EOS>
The
hair
-
breadth
turns
and
twists
we
made
,
drew
down
upon
us
a
variety
of
speeches
from
the
people
standing
about
,
which
were
not
always
complimentary
;
but
my
aunt
drove
on
with
perfect
indifference
,
and
I
dare
say
would
have
taken
her
own
way
with
as
much
coolness
through
an
enemy
's
country
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
we
stopped
before
a
very
old
house
bulging
out
over
the
road
;
a
house
with
long
low
lattice
-
windows
bulging
out
still
farther
,
and
beams
with
carved
heads
on
the
ends
bulging
out
too
,
so
that
I
fancied
the
whole
house
was
leaning
forward
,
trying
to
see
who
was
passing
on
the
narrow
pavement
below
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
spotless
in
its
cleanliness
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
-
fashioned
brass
knocker
on
the
low
arched
door
,
ornamented
with
carved
garlands
of
fruit
and
flowers
,
twinkled
like
a
star
;
the
two
stone
steps
descending
to
the
door
were
as
white
as
if
they
had
been
covered
with
fair
linen
;
and
all
the
angles
and
corners
,
and
carvings
and
mouldings
,
and
quaint
little
panes
of
glass
,
and
quainter
little
windows
,
<EOS>
though
as
old
as
the
hills
,
were
as
pure
as
any
snow
that
ever
fell
upon
the
hills
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
pony
-
chaise
stopped
at
the
door
,
and
my
eyes
were
intent
upon
the
house
,
I
saw
a
cadaverous
face
appear
at
a
small
window
on
the
ground
floor
(
in
a
little
round
tower
that
formed
one
side
of
the
house
)
,
and
quickly
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
The
low
arched
door
then
opened
,
and
the
face
came
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
as
cadaverous
as
it
had
looked
in
the
window
,
though
in
the
grain
of
it
there
was
that
tinge
of
red
which
is
sometimes
to
be
observed
in
the
skins
of
red
-
haired
people
.
 
<EOS>
It
belonged
to
a
red
-
haired
person
---
a
youth
of
fifteen
,
as
I
take
it
now
,
but
looking
much
older
---
whose
hair
was
cropped
as
close
as
the
closest
stubble
;
who
had
hardly
any
eyebrows
,
and
no
eyelashes
,
and
eyes
of
a
red
-
brown
,
so
unsheltered
and
unshaded
,
that
I
remember
wondering
how
he
went
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
high
-
shouldered
and
bony
;
dressed
in
decent
black
,
with
a
white
wisp
of
a
neckcloth
;
buttoned
up
to
the
throat
;
and
had
a
long
,
lank
,
skeleton
hand
,
which
particularly
attracted
my
attention
,
as
he
stood
at
the
pony
's
head
,
rubbing
his
chin
with
it
,
and
looking
up
at
us
in
the
chaise
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr
Wickfield
at
home
,
Uriah
Heep
?
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
's
at
home
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Uriah
Heep
,
"
if
you
'll
please
to
walk
in
there
"
---
pointing
with
his
long
hand
to
the
room
he
meant
.
   
<EOS>
We
got
out
;
and
leaving
him
to
hold
the
pony
,
went
into
a
long
low
parlour
looking
towards
the
street
,
from
the
window
of
which
I
caught
a
glimpse
,
as
I
went
in
,
of
Uriah
Heep
breathing
into
the
pony
's
nostrils
,
and
immediately
covering
them
with
his
hand
,
as
if
he
were
putting
some
spell
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
Opposite
to
the
tall
old
chimney
-
piece
were
two
portraits
:
one
of
a
gentleman
with
grey
hair
(
though
not
by
any
means
an
old
man
)
and
black
eyebrows
,
who
was
looking
over
some
papers
tied
together
with
red
tape
;
the
other
,
of
a
lady
,
with
a
very
placid
and
sweet
expression
of
face
,
who
was
looking
at
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
believe
I
was
turning
about
in
search
of
Uriah
's
picture
,
when
,
a
door
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
opening
,
a
gentleman
entered
,
at
sight
of
whom
I
turned
to
the
first
-
mentioned
portrait
again
,
to
make
quite
sure
that
it
had
not
come
out
of
its
frame
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
stationary
;
and
as
the
gentleman
advanced
into
the
light
,
I
saw
that
he
was
some
years
older
than
when
he
had
had
his
picture
painted
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Betsey
Trotwood
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
"
pray
walk
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
engaged
for
a
moment
,
but
you
'll
excuse
my
being
busy
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
my
motive
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
<EOS>
but
one
in
life
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Betsey
thanked
him
,
and
we
went
into
his
room
,
which
was
furnished
as
an
office
,
with
books
,
papers
,
tin
boxes
,
and
so
forth
.
 
<EOS>
It
looked
into
a
garden
,
and
had
an
iron
safe
let
into
the
wall
;
so
immediately
over
the
mantelshelf
,
that
I
wondered
,
as
I
sat
down
,
how
the
sweeps
got
round
it
when
they
swept
the
chimney
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
;
for
I
soon
found
that
it
was
he
,
and
that
he
was
a
lawyer
,
and
steward
of
the
estates
of
a
rich
gentleman
of
the
county
;
"
what
wind
blows
you
here
?
 
<EOS>
Not
an
ill
wind
<EOS>
,
I
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
come
for
any
law
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
come
for
anything
else
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
hair
was
quite
white
now
,
though
his
eyebrows
were
still
black
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
very
agreeable
face
,
and
,
I
thought
,
was
handsome
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
certain
richness
in
his
complexion
,
which
I
had
been
long
accustomed
,
under
Peggotty
's
tuition
,
to
connect
with
port
wine
;
and
I
fancied
it
was
in
his
voice
too
,
and
referred
his
growing
corpulency
to
the
same
cause
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
cleanly
dressed
,
in
a
blue
coat
,
striped
waistcoat
,
and
nankeen
trousers
;
and
his
fine
frilled
shirt
and
cambric
neckcloth
looked
unusually
soft
and
white
,
reminding
my
strolling
fancy
<EOS>
(
I
call
to
mind
)
of
the
plumage
on
the
breast
of
a
swan
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
my
nephew
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Was
n't
aware
you
had
one
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
grand
-
nephew
,
that
is
to
say
,
"
observed
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Was
n't
aware
you
had
a
grand
-
nephew
,
I
give
you
my
word
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
adopted
him
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
,
importing
that
his
knowledge
and
his
ignorance
were
all
one
to
her
,
"
and
I
have
brought
him
here
,
to
put
to
a
school
where
he
may
be
thoroughly
well
taught
,
and
well
treated
.
 
<EOS>
Now
tell
me
where
that
school
is
,
and
what
it
is
,
and
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Before
I
can
advise
you
properly
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
---
"
the
old
question
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
your
motive
in
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Deuce
take
the
man
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Always
fishing
for
motives
,
when
they
're
on
the
surface
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
to
make
the
child
happy
and
useful
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
a
mixed
motive
,
I
think
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
,
shaking
his
head
and
smiling
incredulously
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
mixed
fiddlestick
,
"
returned
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
claim
to
have
one
plain
motive
in
all
you
do
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
suppose
,
I
hope
,
that
you
are
the
only
plain
dealer
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
but
I
have
only
one
motive
in
life
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
"
he
rejoined
,
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
"
Other
people
have
dozens
,
scores
,
hundreds
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
one
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
the
difference
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
that
's
beside
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
The
best
school
?
 
<EOS>
Whatever
the
motive
,
you
want
the
best
?
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
nodded
assent
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
the
best
we
have
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
,
<EOS>
considering
,
"
your
nephew
could
n't
board
just
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
he
could
board
somewhere
else
,
I
suppose
?
"
suggested
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
thought
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
little
discussion
,
he
proposed
to
take
my
aunt
to
the
school
,
that
she
might
see
it
and
judge
for
herself
;
also
,
to
take
her
,
with
the
same
object
,
to
two
or
three
houses
where
he
thought
I
could
be
boarded
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
embracing
the
proposal
,
we
were
all
three
going
out
together
,
when
he
stopped
and
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
Our
little
friend
here
might
have
some
motive
,
perhaps
,
for
objecting
to
the
arrangements
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
we
had
better
leave
him
behind
?
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
seemed
disposed
to
contest
the
point
;
but
to
facilitate
matters
<EOS>
I
said
I
would
gladly
remain
behind
,
if
they
pleased
;
and
returned
into
Mr
Wickfield
's
office
,
where
I
sat
down
again
,
in
the
chair
I
had
first
occupied
,
to
await
their
return
.
   
<EOS>
It
so
happened
that
this
chair
was
opposite
a
narrow
passage
,
which
ended
in
the
little
circular
room
where
I
had
seen
Uriah
Heep
's
pale
face
looking
out
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
Uriah
,
having
taken
the
pony
to
a
neighbouring
stable
,
was
at
work
at
a
desk
in
this
room
,
which
had
a
brass
frame
on
the
top
to
hang
paper
upon
,
and
on
which
the
writing
he
was
making
a
copy
of
was
then
hanging
.
 
<EOS>
Though
his
face
was
towards
me
,
I
thought
,
for
some
time
,
the
writing
being
between
us
,
that
he
could
not
see
me
;
but
looking
that
way
more
attentively
,
it
made
me
uncomfortable
to
observe
that
,
every
now
and
then
,
his
sleepless
eyes
would
come
below
the
writing
,
like
two
red
suns
,
and
stealthily
stare
at
me
for
I
dare
say
a
whole
minute
at
a
time
,
during
which
his
pen
went
,
or
pretended
to
go
,
as
cleverly
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
several
attempts
to
get
out
of
their
way
---
such
as
standing
on
a
chair
to
look
at
a
map
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
,
and
poring
over
the
columns
of
a
Kentish
newspaper
---
but
they
always
attracted
me
back
again
;
and
whenever
I
looked
towards
those
two
red
suns
,
I
was
sure
to
find
them
,
either
just
rising
or
just
setting
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
,
much
to
my
relief
,
my
aunt
and
Mr
Wickfield
came
back
,
after
a
pretty
long
absence
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
not
so
successful
as
I
could
have
wished
;
for
though
the
advantages
of
the
school
were
undeniable
,
my
aunt
had
not
approved
of
any
of
the
boarding
-
houses
proposed
for
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
unfortunate
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
,
Trot
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
does
happen
unfortunately
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
'll
tell
you
what
you
can
do
,
Miss
Trotwood
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Leave
your
nephew
here
,
for
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
a
quiet
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
He
wo
n't
disturb
me
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
capital
house
for
study
.
 
<EOS>
As
quiet
as
a
monastery
,
and
almost
as
roomy
.
 
<EOS>
Leave
him
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
evidently
liked
the
offer
,
though
she
was
delicate
of
accepting
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
did
I.
"
Come
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
way
out
of
the
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
only
a
temporary
arrangement
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
do
n't
act
well
,
or
do
n't
quite
accord
with
our
mutual
convenience
,
he
can
easily
go
to
the
right
-
about
.
 
<EOS>
There
will
be
time
to
find
some
better
place
for
him
in
the
meanwhile
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
better
determine
to
leave
him
here
for
the
present
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
"
said
my
aunt
;
"
<EOS>
and
so
is
he
,
I
see
;
<EOS>
but
---
"
   
"
Come
!
<EOS>
I
know
what
you
mean
,
"
cried
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
be
oppressed
by
the
receipt
of
favours
,
Miss
Trotwood
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
pay
for
him
,
if
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
We
wo
n't
be
hard
about
terms
,
but
you
shall
pay
if
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
that
understanding
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
though
it
does
n't
lessen
the
real
obligation
,
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
leave
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
come
and
see
my
little
housekeeper
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
.
   
<EOS>
We
accordingly
went
up
a
wonderful
old
staircase
;
with
a
balustrade
so
broad
that
we
might
have
gone
up
that
,
almost
as
easily
;
and
into
a
shady
old
drawing
-
room
,
lighted
by
some
three
or
four
of
the
quaint
windows
I
had
looked
up
at
from
the
street
:
which
had
old
oak
seats
in
them
,
that
seemed
to
have
come
of
the
same
trees
as
the
shining
oak
floor
,
and
the
great
beams
in
the
ceiling
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
prettily
furnished
room
,
with
a
piano
and
some
lively
furniture
in
red
and
green
,
and
some
flowers
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
be
all
old
nooks
and
corners
;
and
in
every
nook
and
corner
there
was
some
queer
little
table
,
or
cupboard
,
or
bookcase
,
or
seat
,
or
something
or
other
,
that
made
me
think
there
was
not
such
another
good
corner
in
the
room
;
until
I
looked
at
the
next
one
,
and
found
it
equal
to
it
,
if
not
better
.
 
<EOS>
On
everything
there
was
the
same
air
of
retirement
and
cleanliness
that
marked
the
house
outside
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
tapped
at
a
door
in
a
corner
of
the
panelled
wall
,
and
a
girl
of
about
my
own
age
came
quickly
out
and
kissed
him
.
 
<EOS>
On
her
face
,
I
saw
immediately
the
placid
and
sweet
expression
of
the
lady
whose
picture
had
looked
at
me
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
my
imagination
as
if
the
portrait
had
grown
womanly
,
and
the
original
remained
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
Although
her
face
was
quite
bright
and
happy
,
there
was
a
tranquillity
about
it
,
and
about
her
---
a
quiet
,
good
,
calm
spirit
---
that
I
never
have
forgotten
;
that
I
shall
never
forget
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
his
little
housekeeper
,
his
daughter
Agnes
,
Mr
Wickfield
said
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
heard
how
he
said
it
,
and
saw
how
he
held
her
hand
,
I
guessed
what
the
one
motive
of
his
life
was
.
   
<EOS>
She
had
a
little
basket
-
trifle
hanging
at
her
side
,
with
keys
in
it
;
and
she
looked
as
staid
and
as
discreet
a
housekeeper
as
the
old
house
could
have
.
 
<EOS>
She
listened
to
her
father
as
he
told
her
about
me
,
with
a
pleasant
face
;
and
when
he
had
concluded
,
proposed
to
my
aunt
that
we
should
go
upstairs
and
see
my
room
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
went
together
,
she
before
us
:
and
a
glorious
old
room
it
was
,
with
more
oak
beams
,
and
diamond
panes
;
and
the
broad
balustrade
going
all
the
way
up
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
can
not
call
to
mind
where
or
when
,
in
my
childhood
,
I
had
seen
a
stained
glass
window
in
a
church
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
do
I
recollect
its
subject
.
<EOS>
But
I
know
that
when
I
saw
her
turn
round
,
in
the
grave
light
of
the
old
staircase
,
and
wait
for
us
,
above
,
I
thought
of
that
window
;
and
I
associated
something
of
its
tranquil
brightness
with
Agnes
Wickfield
ever
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
was
as
happy
as
I
was
,
in
the
arrangement
made
for
me
;
and
we
went
down
to
the
drawing
-
room
again
,
well
pleased
and
gratified
.
<EOS>
As
she
would
not
hear
of
staying
to
dinner
,
lest
she
should
by
any
chance
fail
to
arrive
at
home
with
the
grey
pony
before
dark
;
and
as
I
apprehend
Mr
Wickfield
knew
her
too
well
to
argue
any
point
with
her
;
some
lunch
was
provided
for
her
there
,
and
Agnes
went
back
to
her
governess
,
and
Mr
Wickfield
to
his
office
.
 
<EOS>
So
we
were
left
to
take
leave
of
one
another
without
any
restraint
.
   
<EOS>
She
told
me
that
everything
would
be
arranged
for
me
by
Mr
Wickfield
,
and
that
I
should
want
for
nothing
,
and
gave
me
the
kindest
words
and
the
best
advice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trot
,
"
said
my
aunt
in
conclusion
,
"
be
a
credit
to
yourself
,
to
me
,
and
Mr
Dick
,
and
Heaven
be
with
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
greatly
overcome
,
and
could
only
thank
her
,
again
and
again
,
and
send
my
love
to
Mr
Dick
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
be
mean
in
anything
;
never
be
false
;
never
be
cruel
.
 
<EOS>
Avoid
those
three
vices
,
Trot
,
and
I
can
always
be
hopeful
of
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
promised
,
as
well
as
<EOS>
I
could
,
that
I
would
not
abuse
her
kindness
or
forget
her
admonition
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
pony
's
at
the
door
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
and
I
am
off
!
<EOS>
Stay
here
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
these
words
she
embraced
me
hastily
,
and
went
out
of
the
room
,
shutting
the
door
after
her
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
I
was
startled
by
so
abrupt
a
departure
,
and
almost
feared
I
had
displeased
her
;
but
when
I
looked
into
the
street
,
and
saw
how
dejectedly
she
got
into
the
chaise
,
and
drove
away
without
looking
up
,
I
understood
her
better
and
did
not
do
her
that
injustice
.
   
<EOS>
By
five
o'clock
,
which
was
Mr
Wickfield
's
dinner
-
hour
,
I
had
mustered
up
my
spirits
again
,
and
was
ready
for
my
knife
and
fork
.
<EOS>
The
cloth
was
only
laid
for
us
two
;
but
Agnes
was
waiting
in
the
drawing
-
room
before
dinner
,
went
down
with
her
father
,
and
sat
opposite
to
him
at
table
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubted
whether
he
could
have
dined
without
her
.
   
<EOS>
We
did
not
stay
there
,
after
dinner
,
but
came
upstairs
into
the
drawing
-
room
again
:
in
one
snug
corner
of
which
,
Agnes
set
glasses
for
her
father
,
and
a
decanter
of
port
wine
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
he
would
have
missed
its
usual
flavour
,
if
it
had
been
put
there
for
him
by
any
other
hands
.
   
<EOS>
There
he
sat
,
taking
his
wine
,
and
taking
a
good
deal
of
it
,
for
two
hours
;
while
Agnes
played
on
the
piano
,
worked
,
and
talked
to
him
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
,
for
the
most
part
,
gay
and
cheerful
with
us
;
but
sometimes
his
eyes
rested
on
her
,
and
he
fell
into
a
brooding
state
,
and
was
silent
.
 
<EOS>
She
always
observed
this
quickly
,
I
thought
,
and
always
roused
him
with
a
question
or
caress
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
came
out
of
his
meditation
,
and
drank
more
wine
.
   
<EOS>
Agnes
made
the
tea
,
and
presided
over
it
;
and
the
time
passed
away
after
it
,
as
after
dinner
,
until
she
went
to
bed
;
when
her
father
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
,
and
,
she
being
gone
,
ordered
candles
in
his
office
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
went
to
bed
too
.
   
<EOS>
But
in
the
course
of
the
evening
I
had
rambled
down
to
the
door
,
and
a
little
way
along
the
street
,
that
I
might
have
another
peep
at
the
old
houses
,
and
the
grey
Cathedral
;
and
might
think
of
my
coming
through
that
old
city
on
my
journey
,
and
of
my
passing
the
very
house
I
lived
in
,
without
knowing
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
came
back
,
I
saw
Uriah
Heep
shutting
up
the
office
;
and
feeling
friendly
towards
everybody
,
went
in
and
spoke
to
him
,
and
at
parting
,
gave
him
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
But
oh
,
what
a
clammy
hand
<EOS>
his
was
!
<EOS>
as
ghostly
to
the
touch
as
to
the
sight
!
 
<EOS>
I
rubbed
mine
afterwards
,
to
warm
it
,
AND
TO
RUB
HIS
OFF
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
such
an
uncomfortable
hand
,
that
,
when
I
went
to
my
room
,
it
was
still
cold
and
wet
upon
my
memory
.
 
<EOS>
Leaning
out
of
the
window
,
and
seeing
one
of
the
faces
on
the
beam
-
ends
looking
at
me
sideways
,
I
fancied
it
was
Uriah
Heep
got
up
there
somehow
,
and
shut
him
out
in
a
hurry
.

<EOS>
I
am
a
new
boy
in
more
senses
than
one
 
Next
morning
,
after
breakfast
,
I
entered
on
school
life
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
,
accompanied
by
Mr
Wickfield
,
to
the
scene
of
my
future
studies
---
a
grave
building
in
a
courtyard
,
with
a
learned
air
about
it
that
seemed
very
well
suited
to
the
stray
rooks
and
jackdaws
who
came
down
from
the
Cathedral
towers
to
walk
with
a
clerkly
bearing
on
the
grass
-
plot
---
and
was
introduced
to
my
new
master
,
Doctor
Strong
.
   
<EOS>
Doctor
Strong
looked
almost
as
rusty
,
to
my
thinking
,
as
the
tall
iron
rails
and
gates
outside
the
house
;
and
almost
as
stiff
and
heavy
as
the
great
stone
urns
that
flanked
them
,
and
were
set
up
,
on
the
top
of
the
red
-
brick
wall
,
at
regular
distances
<EOS>
all
round
the
court
,
like
sublimated
skittles
,
for
Time
to
play
at
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
his
library
(
I
mean
Doctor
Strong
was
)
,
with
his
clothes
not
particularly
well
brushed
,
and
his
hair
not
particularly
well
combed
;
his
knee
-
smalls
unbraced
;
his
long
black
gaiters
unbuttoned
;
and
his
shoes
yawning
like
two
caverns
on
the
hearth
-
rug
.
 
<EOS>
Turning
upon
me
a
lustreless
eye
,
that
reminded
me
of
a
long
-
forgotten
blind
old
horse
who
once
used
to
crop
the
grass
,
and
tumble
over
the
graves
,
in
Blunderstone
churchyard
,
he
said
he
was
glad
to
see
me
:
<EOS>
and
then
he
gave
me
his
hand
;
which
I
did
n't
know
what
to
do
with
,
as
it
did
nothing
for
itself
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
sitting
at
work
,
not
far
from
Doctor
Strong
,
was
a
very
pretty
young
lady
---
whom
he
called
Annie
,
and
who
was
his
daughter
<EOS>
,
I
supposed
---
<EOS>
who
got
me
out
of
my
difficulty
by
kneeling
down
to
put
Doctor
Strong
's
shoes
on
,
and
button
his
gaiters
,
which
she
did
with
great
cheerfulness
and
quickness
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
finished
,
and
we
were
going
out
to
the
schoolroom
,
I
was
much
surprised
to
hear
Mr
Wickfield
,
in
bidding
her
good
morning
,
address
her
as
"
Mrs
Strong
"
;
and
I
was
wondering
could
she
be
Doctor
Strong
's
son
's
wife
,
or
could
she
be
Mrs
Doctor
Strong
,
when
Doctor
Strong
himself
unconsciously
enlightened
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
the
by
,
Wickfield
,
"
he
said
,
stopping
in
a
passage
with
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
;
"
you
have
not
found
any
suitable
provision
for
my
wife
's
cousin
yet
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
 
Not
yet
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
wish
it
done
as
soon
as
it
can
be
done
,
Wickfield
,
"
said
Doctor
Strong
,
"
for
<EOS>
Jack
Maldon
is
needy
,
and
idle
;
and
of
those
two
bad
things
,
worse
things
sometimes
come
.
 
<EOS>
What
does
Doctor
Watts
say
,
"
he
added
,
looking
at
me
,
and
moving
his
head
to
the
time
of
his
quotation
,
"
"
Satan
finds
some
mischief
still
,
for
idle
hands
to
do
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
Egad
,
Doctor
,
"
returned
Mr
Wickfield
,
"
if
Doctor
Watts
knew
mankind
,
he
might
have
written
,
with
as
much
truth
,
"
Satan
finds
some
mischief
still
,
for
busy
hands
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
The
busy
people
achieve
their
full
share
of
mischief
in
the
world
,
you
may
rely
upon
it
.
<EOS>
What
have
the
people
been
about
,
who
have
been
the
busiest
in
getting
money
,
and
in
getting
power
,
this
century
or
two
?
 
<EOS>
No
mischief
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Jack
Maldon
will
never
be
very
busy
in
getting
either
,
I
expect
,
"
said
Doctor
Strong
,
rubbing
his
chin
thoughtfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
;
"
and
you
bring
me
back
to
the
question
,
with
an
apology
for
digressing
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
have
not
been
able
to
dispose
of
Mr
Jack
Maldon
yet
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
"
he
said
this
with
some
hesitation
,
"
I
penetrate
your
motive
,
and
it
makes
the
thing
more
difficult
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
motive
,
"
returned
Doctor
Strong
,
"
is
to
make
some
suitable
provision
for
a
cousin
,
and
an
old
playfellow
,
of
Annie
's
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
know
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
;
"
at
home
or
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
"
replied
the
Doctor
,
apparently
wondering
why
he
emphasized
those
words
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
home
or
abroad
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
own
expression
<EOS>
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
Or
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
"
the
Doctor
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Surely
.
 
<EOS>
One
or
other
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
One
or
other
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
no
choice
?
"
asked
Mr
Wickfield
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
returned
the
Doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
?
"
with
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
the
least
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
motive
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
,
"
for
meaning
abroad
,
and
not
at
home
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
returned
the
Doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
bound
to
believe
you
,
and
of
course
I
do
believe
you
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
might
have
simplified
my
office
very
much
,
if
I
had
known
it
before
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
confess
I
entertained
another
impression
.
"
   
<EOS>
Doctor
Strong
regarded
him
with
a
puzzled
and
doubting
look
,
which
almost
immediately
subsided
into
a
smile
that
gave
me
great
encouragement
;
for
it
was
full
of
amiability
and
sweetness
,
and
there
was
a
simplicity
in
it
,
and
indeed
in
his
whole
manner
,
when
the
studious
,
pondering
frost
upon
it
was
got
through
,
very
attractive
and
hopeful
to
a
young
scholar
like
me
.
 
<EOS>
Repeating
"
no
"
,
and
"
not
the
least
"
,
and
other
short
assurances
to
the
same
purport
,
Doctor
Strong
jogged
on
before
us
,
at
a
queer
,
uneven
pace
;
and
we
followed
:
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
,
looking
grave
,
I
observed
,
and
shaking
his
head
to
himself
,
without
knowing
that
I
saw
him
.
   
<EOS>
The
schoolroom
was
a
pretty
large
hall
,
on
the
quietest
side
of
the
house
,
confronted
by
the
stately
stare
of
some
half
-
dozen
of
the
great
urns
,
and
commanding
a
peep
of
an
old
secluded
garden
belonging
to
the
Doctor
,
where
the
peaches
were
ripening
on
the
sunny
south
wall
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
two
great
aloes
,
in
tubs
,
on
the
turf
outside
the
windows
;
the
broad
hard
leaves
of
which
plant
(
looking
as
if
they
were
made
of
painted
tin
)
<EOS>
have
ever
since
,
by
association
,
been
symbolical
to
me
of
silence
and
retirement
.
<EOS>
About
five
-
and
-
twenty
boys
were
studiously
engaged
at
their
books
when
we
went
in
,
but
they
rose
to
give
the
Doctor
good
morning
,
and
remained
standing
when
they
saw
Mr
Wickfield
and
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
new
boy
,
young
gentlemen
,
"
said
the
Doctor
;
"
Trotwood
Copperfield
.
"
   
<EOS>
One
Adams
,
who
was
the
head
-
boy
,
then
stepped
out
of
his
place
and
welcomed
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
like
a
young
clergyman
,
in
his
white
cravat
,
but
he
was
very
affable
and
good
-
humoured
;
and
he
showed
me
my
place
,
and
presented
me
to
the
masters
,
in
a
gentlemanly
way
that
would
have
put
me
at
my
ease
,
if
anything
could
.
   
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
me
so
long
,
however
,
since
I
had
been
among
such
boys
,
or
among
any
companions
of
my
own
age
,
except
Mick
Walker
and
Mealy
Potatoes
,
that
I
felt
as
strange
as
ever
<EOS>
I
have
done
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
conscious
of
having
passed
through
scenes
of
which
they
could
have
no
knowledge
,
and
of
having
acquired
experiences
foreign
to
my
age
,
appearance
,
and
condition
as
one
of
them
,
that
I
half
believed
it
was
an
imposture
to
come
there
as
an
ordinary
little
schoolboy
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
become
,
in
the
Murdstone
and
Grinby
time
,
<EOS>
however
short
or
long
it
may
have
been
,
so
unused
to
the
sports
and
games
of
boys
<EOS>
,
that
I
knew
I
was
awkward
and
inexperienced
in
the
commonest
things
belonging
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
I
had
learnt
,
had
so
slipped
away
from
me
in
the
sordid
cares
of
my
life
from
day
to
night
,
that
now
,
when
I
was
examined
about
what
I
knew
,
I
knew
nothing
,
and
was
put
into
the
lowest
form
of
the
school
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
troubled
as
I
was
,
by
my
want
of
boyish
skill
,
and
of
book
-
learning
too
,
I
was
made
infinitely
more
uncomfortable
by
the
consideration
,
that
,
in
what
I
did
know
,
I
was
much
farther
removed
from
my
companions
than
in
what
I
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
My
mind
ran
upon
what
they
would
think
,
if
they
knew
of
my
familiar
acquaintance
with
the
King
's
Bench
Prison
?
 
<EOS>
Was
there
anything
about
me
which
would
reveal
my
proceedings
in
connexion
with
the
Micawber
family
---
all
those
pawnings
,
and
sellings
,
and
suppers
---
in
spite
of
myself
?
<EOS>
Suppose
some
of
the
boys
had
seen
me
coming
through
Canterbury
,
wayworn
and
ragged
,
and
should
find
me
out
?
 
<EOS>
What
would
they
say
,
who
made
so
light
of
money
,
if
they
could
know
how
I
had
scraped
my
halfpence
together
,
for
the
purchase
of
my
daily
saveloy
and
beer
,
or
<EOS>
my
slices
of
pudding
?
 
<EOS>
How
would
it
affect
them
,
who
were
so
innocent
of
London
life
,
and
London
streets
,
to
discover
how
knowing
I
was
(
and
was
ashamed
to
be
)
in
some
of
the
meanest
phases
of
both
?
 
<EOS>
All
this
ran
in
my
head
so
much
,
on
that
first
day
at
Doctor
Strong
's
,
that
I
felt
distrustful
of
my
slightest
look
and
gesture
;
shrunk
within
myself
whensoever
I
was
approached
by
one
of
my
new
schoolfellows
;
and
hurried
off
the
minute
school
was
over
,
afraid
of
committing
myself
in
my
response
to
any
friendly
notice
or
advance
.
   
<EOS>
But
there
was
such
an
influence
in
Mr
Wickfield
's
old
house
,
that
when
I
knocked
at
it
,
with
my
new
school
-
books
under
my
arm
,
I
began
to
feel
my
uneasiness
softening
away
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
went
up
to
my
airy
old
room
,
the
grave
shadow
of
the
staircase
seemed
to
fall
upon
my
doubts
and
fears
,
and
to
make
the
past
more
indistinct
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
there
,
sturdily
conning
my
books
,
until
dinner
-
time
<EOS>
(
we
were
out
of
school
for
good
at
three
)
;
and
went
down
,
hopeful
of
becoming
a
passable
sort
of
boy
yet
.
   
<EOS>
Agnes
was
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
waiting
for
her
father
,
who
was
detained
by
someone
in
his
office
.
 
<EOS>
She
met
me
with
her
pleasant
smile
,
and
asked
me
how
I
liked
the
school
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
I
should
like
it
very
much
,
I
hoped
;
but
I
was
a
little
strange
to
it
at
first
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
never
been
to
school
,
"
I
said
,
"
have
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
!
 
<EOS>
Every
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
but
you
mean
here
,
at
your
own
home
?
"
   
"
Papa
could
n't
spare
me
to
go
anywhere
else
,
"
she
answered
,
smiling
and
shaking
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
housekeeper
must
be
in
his
house
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
very
fond
of
you
,
I
am
sure
,
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
She
nodded
"
Yes
,
"
and
went
to
the
door
to
listen
for
his
coming
up
,
that
she
might
meet
him
on
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
he
was
not
there
,
she
came
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mama
has
been
dead
ever
since
I
was
born
,
"
she
said
,
in
her
quiet
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
know
her
picture
,
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
you
looking
at
it
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
think
whose
it
was
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
told
her
yes
,
because
it
was
so
like
herself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Papa
says
so
,
too
,
"
said
Agnes
,
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
papa
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
bright
calm
face
lighted
up
with
pleasure
as
she
went
to
meet
him
,
and
as
they
came
in
,
hand
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
greeted
me
cordially
;
and
told
me
I
should
certainly
be
happy
under
Doctor
Strong
,
who
was
one
of
the
gentlest
of
men
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
may
be
some
,
perhaps
---
I
do
n't
know
that
there
are
---
who
abuse
his
kindness
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
be
one
of
those
,
Trotwood
,
in
anything
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
the
least
suspicious
of
mankind
;
and
whether
that
's
a
merit
,
or
whether
it
's
a
blemish
,
it
deserves
consideration
in
all
dealings
with
the
Doctor
,
great
or
small
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
spoke
,
I
thought
,
as
if
he
were
weary
,
or
dissatisfied
with
something
;
but
I
did
not
pursue
the
question
in
my
mind
,
for
dinner
was
just
then
announced
,
and
we
went
down
and
took
the
same
seats
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
scarcely
done
so
,
when
Uriah
Heep
put
in
his
red
head
and
his
lank
hand
at
the
door
,
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Here
's
Mr
Maldon
begs
the
favour
of
a
word
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
<EOS>
but
this
moment
quit
of
Mr
Maldon
,
"
said
his
master
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
returned
Uriah
;
"
but
Mr
Maldon
has
come
back
,
and
he
begs
the
favour
of
a
word
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
held
the
door
open
with
his
hand
,
Uriah
looked
at
me
,
and
looked
at
Agnes
,
and
looked
at
the
dishes
,
and
looked
at
the
plates
,
and
looked
at
every
object
in
the
room
,
I
thought
,
---
yet
seemed
to
look
at
nothing
;
he
made
such
an
appearance
all
the
while
of
keeping
his
red
eyes
dutifully
on
his
master
.
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
only
to
say
,
on
reflection
,
"
observed
a
voice
behind
Uriah
,
as
Uriah
's
head
was
pushed
away
,
and
the
speaker
's
substituted
---
"
pray
excuse
me
for
this
intrusion
---
that
as
it
seems
I
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
,
the
sooner
I
go
abroad
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
My
cousin
Annie
did
say
,
when
we
talked
of
it
,
that
she
liked
to
have
her
friends
within
reach
rather
than
to
have
them
banished
,
and
the
old
Doctor
---
"
   
"
Doctor
Strong
,
was
that
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
interposed
,
gravely
.
   
<EOS>
"
Doctor
Strong
,
of
course
,
"
returned
the
other
;
"
I
call
him
the
old
Doctor
;
it
's
all
the
same
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
returned
Mr
Wickfield
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Doctor
Strong
,
"
said
the
other
---
"
Doctor
Strong
was
of
the
same
mind
,
I
believed
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
it
appears
from
the
course
you
take
with
me
he
has
changed
his
mind
,
why
there
's
no
more
to
be
said
,
except
that
the
sooner
I
am
off
,
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
I
thought
I
'd
come
back
and
say
,
that
the
sooner
I
am
off
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
When
a
plunge
is
to
be
made
into
the
water
,
it
's
of
no
use
lingering
on
the
bank
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
shall
be
as
little
lingering
as
possible
,
in
your
case
,
Mr
Maldon
,
you
may
depend
upon
it
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
"
said
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Much
obliged
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
look
a
gift
-
horse
in
the
mouth
,
which
is
not
a
gracious
thing
to
do
;
otherwise
,
I
dare
say
,
my
cousin
Annie
could
easily
arrange
it
in
her
own
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
Annie
would
only
have
to
say
to
the
old
Doctor
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Meaning
that
Mrs
Strong
would
only
have
to
say
to
her
husband
<EOS>
---
do
I
follow
you
?
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
so
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
---
would
only
have
to
say
,
that
she
wanted
such
and
such
a
thing
to
be
so
and
so
;
and
it
would
be
so
and
so
,
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
why
as
a
matter
of
course
,
Mr
Maldon
?
"
asked
Mr
Wickfield
,
sedately
eating
his
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
because
Annie
's
a
charming
young
girl
,
and
the
old
Doctor
---
Doctor
Strong
,
I
mean
---
is
not
quite
a
charming
young
boy
,
"
said
Mr
Jack
Maldon
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
offence
to
anybody
,
Mr
Wickfield
.
<EOS>
I
only
mean
that
I
suppose
some
compensation
is
fair
and
reasonable
in
that
sort
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Compensation
to
the
lady
,
sir
?
"
asked
Mr
Wickfield
gravely
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
the
lady
,
sir
,
"
Mr
Jack
Maldon
answered
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
But
appearing
to
remark
that
Mr
Wickfield
went
on
with
his
dinner
in
the
same
sedate
,
immovable
manner
,
and
that
there
was
no
hope
of
making
him
relax
a
muscle
of
his
face
,
he
added
:
"
However
,
I
have
said
what
I
came
to
say
,
and
,
with
another
apology
for
this
intrusion
,
I
may
take
myself
off
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
I
shall
observe
your
directions
,
in
considering
the
matter
as
one
to
be
arranged
between
you
and
me
solely
,
and
not
to
be
referred
to
,
up
at
the
Doctor
's
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
dined
?
"
asked
Mr
Wickfield
,
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
towards
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
dine
,
"
said
Mr
Maldon
,
"
with
my
cousin
Annie
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
,
without
rising
,
looked
after
him
thoughtfully
as
he
went
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
rather
a
shallow
sort
of
young
gentleman
,
I
thought
,
with
a
handsome
face
,
a
rapid
utterance
,
and
a
confident
,
bold
air
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
was
the
first
I
ever
saw
of
Mr
Jack
Maldon
;
whom
I
had
not
expected
to
see
so
soon
,
when
I
heard
the
Doctor
speak
of
him
that
morning
.
   
<EOS>
When
we
had
dined
,
we
went
upstairs
again
,
where
everything
went
on
exactly
as
on
the
previous
day
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
set
the
glasses
and
decanters
in
the
same
corner
,
and
Mr
Wickfield
sat
down
to
drink
,
and
drank
a
good
deal
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
played
the
piano
to
him
,
sat
by
him
,
and
worked
and
talked
,
and
played
some
games
at
dominoes
with
me
.
<EOS>
In
good
time
she
made
tea
;
and
afterwards
,
when
I
brought
down
my
books
,
looked
into
them
,
and
showed
me
what
she
knew
of
them
(
which
was
no
slight
matter
,
though
she
said
it
was
)
,
and
what
was
the
best
way
to
learn
and
understand
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
her
,
with
her
modest
,
orderly
,
placid
manner
,
and
I
hear
her
beautiful
calm
voice
,
as
I
write
these
words
.
 
<EOS>
The
influence
for
all
good
,
which
she
came
to
exercise
over
me
at
a
later
time
,
begins
already
to
descend
upon
my
breast
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
little
Em'ly
,
and
I
do
n't
love
Agnes
---
<EOS>
no
,
not
at
all
in
that
way
<EOS>
---
but
I
feel
that
there
are
goodness
,
peace
,
and
truth
,
wherever
Agnes
is
;
and
that
the
soft
light
of
the
coloured
window
in
the
church
,
seen
long
ago
,
falls
on
her
always
,
and
on
me
when
I
am
near
her
,
and
on
everything
around
.
   
<EOS>
The
time
having
come
for
her
withdrawal
for
the
night
,
and
she
having
left
us
,
I
gave
Mr
Wickfield
my
hand
,
preparatory
to
going
away
myself
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
checked
me
and
said
:
"
Should
you
like
to
stay
with
us
,
Trotwood
,
or
to
go
elsewhere
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
stay
,
"
I
answered
,
quickly
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
sure
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
may
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
's
but
<EOS>
a
dull
life
that
we
lead
here
<EOS>
,
boy
,
I
am
afraid
,
"
he
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
more
dull
for
me
than
Agnes
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Not
dull
at
all
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Than
Agnes
,
"
he
repeated
,
walking
slowly
to
the
great
chimney
-
piece
,
and
leaning
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Than
Agnes
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
drank
wine
that
evening
<EOS>
(
or
I
fancied
it
)
,
until
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
I
could
see
them
now
,
for
they
were
cast
down
,
and
shaded
by
his
hand
;
but
I
had
noticed
them
a
little
while
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
I
wonder
,
"
he
muttered
,
"
whether
my
Agnes
tires
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
should
I
ever
tire
of
her
!
 
<EOS>
But
that
's
different
<EOS>
,
that
's
quite
different
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
musing
,
not
speaking
to
me
;
so
I
remained
quiet
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
dull
old
house
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
a
monotonous
life
;
but
I
must
have
her
near
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
keep
her
near
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
thought
that
I
may
die
and
leave
my
darling
,
or
that
my
darling
may
die
and
leave
me
,
comes
like
a
spectre
,
to
distress
my
happiest
hours
,
and
is
only
to
be
drowned
in
---
"
   
<EOS>
He
did
not
supply
the
word
;
but
pacing
slowly
to
the
place
where
he
had
sat
,
and
mechanically
going
through
the
action
of
pouring
wine
from
the
empty
decanter
,
set
it
down
and
paced
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
is
miserable
to
bear
,
when
she
is
here
,
"
he
said
,
"
what
would
it
be
,
and
she
away
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
try
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
leaned
against
the
chimney
-
piece
,
brooding
so
long
that
I
could
not
decide
whether
to
run
the
risk
of
disturbing
him
by
going
,
or
to
remain
quietly
where
I
was
,
until
he
should
come
out
of
his
reverie
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
aroused
himself
,
and
looked
about
the
room
until
his
eyes
encountered
mine
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
with
us
,
Trotwood
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
in
his
usual
manner
,
and
as
if
he
were
answering
something
I
had
just
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
are
company
to
us
both
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
wholesome
to
have
you
here
.
<EOS>
Wholesome
for
me
,
wholesome
for
Agnes
,
wholesome
perhaps
for
all
of
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
it
is
for
me
,
sir
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
to
be
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
fine
fellow
!
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
long
as
you
are
glad
to
be
here
,
you
shall
stay
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
shook
hands
with
me
upon
it
,
and
clapped
me
on
the
back
;
and
told
me
that
when
I
had
anything
to
do
at
night
after
Agnes
had
left
us
,
or
when
I
wished
to
read
for
my
own
pleasure
,
I
was
free
to
come
down
to
his
room
,
if
he
were
there
<EOS>
and
if
I
desired
it
for
company
's
sake
,
and
to
sit
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
thanked
him
for
his
consideration
;
and
,
as
he
went
down
soon
afterwards
,
and
I
was
not
tired
,
went
down
too
,
with
a
book
in
my
hand
,
to
avail
myself
,
for
half
-
an
-
hour
,
of
his
permission
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
seeing
a
light
in
the
little
round
office
,
and
immediately
feeling
myself
attracted
towards
Uriah
Heep
,
who
had
a
sort
of
fascination
for
me
<EOS>
,
I
went
in
there
instead
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
Uriah
reading
a
great
fat
book
,
with
such
demonstrative
attention
,
that
his
lank
forefinger
followed
up
every
line
as
he
read
,
and
made
clammy
tracks
along
the
page
(
or
so
I
fully
believed
)
like
a
snail
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
working
late
tonight
,
Uriah
,
"
says
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
says
Uriah
.
   
<EOS>
As
I
was
getting
on
the
stool
opposite
,
to
talk
to
him
more
conveniently
,
I
observed
that
he
had
not
such
a
thing
as
a
smile
about
him
,
and
that
he
could
only
widen
his
mouth
and
make
two
hard
creases
down
his
cheeks
,
one
on
each
side
,
to
stand
for
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
doing
office
-
work
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
said
Uriah
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
work
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
improving
my
legal
knowledge
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
said
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
through
Tidd
's
Practice
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
a
writer
Mr
Tidd
is
,
Master
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
My
stool
was
such
a
tower
of
observation
,
that
as
I
watched
him
reading
on
again
,
after
this
rapturous
exclamation
,
and
following
up
the
lines
with
his
forefinger
,
I
observed
that
his
nostrils
,
which
were
thin
and
pointed
,
with
sharp
dints
in
them
,
had
a
singular
and
most
uncomfortable
way
of
expanding
and
contracting
themselves
---
that
they
seemed
to
twinkle
instead
of
his
eyes
,
which
hardly
ever
twinkled
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
are
quite
a
great
lawyer
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
after
looking
at
him
for
some
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Me
,
Master
Copperfield
?
"
said
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
very
umble
person
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
no
fancy
of
mine
about
his
hands
,
I
observed
;
for
he
frequently
ground
the
palms
against
each
other
as
if
to
squeeze
them
dry
and
warm
,
besides
often
wiping
them
,
in
a
stealthy
way
,
on
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
well
aware
that
I
am
the
umblest
person
going
,
"
said
Uriah
Heep
,
modestly
;
"
let
the
other
be
where
he
may
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
is
likewise
a
very
umble
person
.
 
<EOS>
We
live
in
a
numble
abode
,
Master
Copperfield
,
but
have
much
to
be
thankful
for
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
's
former
calling
was
umble
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
sexton
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
he
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
partaker
of
glory
at
present
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
said
Uriah
Heep
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
we
have
much
to
be
thankful
for
.
 
<EOS>
How
much
have
I
to
be
thankful
for
in
living
with
Mr
Wickfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
asked
Uriah
if
he
had
been
with
Mr
Wickfield
long
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
with
him
,
going
on
four
year
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
said
Uriah
;
shutting
up
his
book
,
after
carefully
marking
the
place
where
he
had
left
off
.
 
<EOS>
"
Since
a
year
after
my
father
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
How
much
have
I
to
be
thankful
for
,
in
that
!
 
<EOS>
How
much
have
I
to
be
thankful
for
,
in
Mr
Wickfield
's
kind
intention
to
give
me
my
articles
,
which
would
otherwise
not
lay
within
the
umble
means
of
mother
and
self
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
when
your
articled
time
is
over
,
you
'll
be
a
regular
lawyer
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
With
the
blessing
of
Providence
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
returned
Uriah
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
'll
be
a
partner
in
Mr
Wickfield
's
business
,
one
of
these
days
,
"
I
said
,
to
make
myself
agreeable
;
"
and
it
will
be
Wickfield
and
Heep
,
or
Heep
late
Wickfield
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
returned
Uriah
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
I
am
much
too
umble
for
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
certainly
did
look
uncommonly
like
the
carved
face
on
the
beam
outside
my
window
,
as
he
sat
,
in
his
humility
,
eyeing
me
sideways
,
with
his
mouth
widened
,
and
the
creases
in
his
cheeks
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
 
Wickfield
is
a
most
excellent
man
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
said
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
known
him
long
,
you
know
it
,
I
am
sure
,
much
better
than
I
can
inform
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
replied
that
I
was
certain
he
was
;
but
that
I
had
not
known
him
long
myself
,
though
he
was
a
friend
of
my
aunt
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
indeed
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
said
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
aunt
is
a
sweet
lady
,
Master
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
a
way
of
writhing
when
he
wanted
to
express
enthusiasm
,
which
was
very
ugly
;
and
which
diverted
my
attention
from
the
compliment
he
had
paid
my
relation
,
to
the
snaky
twistings
of
his
throat
and
body
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
sweet
lady
,
Master
Copperfield
!
"
said
Uriah
Heep
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
a
great
admiration
for
Miss
Agnes
,
Master
Copperfield
,
I
believe
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
Yes
,
"
boldly
;
not
that
I
knew
anything
about
it
,
Heaven
forgive
me
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
,
too
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
said
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
sure
you
must
have
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Everybody
must
have
,
"
I
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
thank
you
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
said
Uriah
Heep
,
"
for
that
remark
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
so
true
!
 
<EOS>
Umble
<EOS>
as
I
am
,
I
know
it
is
so
true
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
thank
you
,
Master
Copperfield
!
"
<EOS>
He
writhed
himself
quite
off
his
stool
in
the
excitement
of
his
feelings
,
and
,
being
off
,
began
to
make
arrangements
for
going
home
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mother
will
be
expecting
me
,
"
he
said
,
referring
to
a
pale
,
inexpressive
-
faced
watch
in
his
pocket
,
"
and
getting
uneasy
;
for
though
we
are
very
umble
,
Master
Copperfield
,
we
are
much
attached
to
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
would
come
and
see
us
,
any
afternoon
,
and
take
a
cup
of
tea
at
our
lowly
dwelling
,
mother
would
be
as
proud
of
your
company
as
I
should
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
said
I
should
be
glad
to
come
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
returned
Uriah
,
putting
his
book
away
upon
the
shelf
---
"
I
suppose
you
stop
here
,
some
time
,
Master
Copperfield
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
said
I
was
going
to
be
brought
up
there
<EOS>
,
I
believed
,
as
long
as
I
remained
at
school
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
YOU
would
come
into
the
business
at
last
,
Master
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
protested
that
I
had
no
views
of
that
sort
,
and
that
no
such
scheme
was
entertained
in
my
behalf
by
anybody
;
but
Uriah
insisted
on
blandly
replying
to
all
my
assurances
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
,
Master
Copperfield
,
I
should
think
you
would
,
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
"
Oh
,
indeed
,
Master
Copperfield
,
I
should
think
you
would
,
certainly
!
"
<EOS>
over
and
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
Being
,
at
last
,
ready
to
leave
the
office
for
the
night
<EOS>
,
he
asked
me
if
it
would
suit
my
convenience
to
have
the
light
put
out
;
and
on
my
answering
"
Yes
,
"
instantly
extinguished
it
.
 
<EOS>
After
shaking
hands
with
me
---
his
hand
felt
like
a
fish
,
in
the
dark
---
he
opened
the
door
into
the
street
a
very
little
,
and
crept
out
,
and
shut
it
,
leaving
me
to
grope
my
way
back
into
the
house
:
which
cost
me
some
trouble
and
a
fall
over
his
stool
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
proximate
cause
,
I
suppose
,
of
my
dreaming
about
him
,
for
what
appeared
to
me
to
be
half
the
night
;
and
dreaming
,
among
other
things
,
that
he
had
launched
Mr
Peggotty
's
house
on
a
piratical
expedition
,
with
a
black
flag
at
the
masthead
,
bearing
the
inscription
"
Tidd
's
Practice
"
,
under
which
diabolical
ensign
he
was
carrying
me
and
little
Em'ly
to
the
Spanish
Main
,
to
be
drowned
.
   
<EOS>
I
got
a
little
the
better
of
my
uneasiness
when
I
went
to
school
next
day
,
and
a
good
deal
the
better
next
day
,
and
so
shook
it
off
by
degrees
,
that
in
less
than
a
fortnight
<EOS>
I
was
quite
at
home
,
and
happy
,
among
my
new
companions
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
awkward
enough
in
their
games
,
and
backward
enough
in
their
studies
;
but
custom
would
improve
me
in
the
first
respect
,
I
hoped
,
and
hard
work
in
the
second
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
I
went
to
work
very
hard
,
both
in
play
and
in
earnest
,
and
gained
great
commendation
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
in
a
very
little
while
,
the
Murdstone
and
Grinby
life
became
so
strange
to
me
that
I
hardly
believed
in
it
,
while
my
present
life
grew
so
familiar
,
that
I
seemed
to
have
been
leading
it
a
long
time
.
   
<EOS>
Doctor
Strong
's
was
an
excellent
school
;
as
different
from
Mr
Creakle
's
as
good
is
from
evil
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
gravely
and
decorously
ordered
,
and
on
a
sound
system
;
with
an
appeal
,
in
everything
,
to
the
honour
and
good
faith
of
the
boys
,
and
an
avowed
intention
to
rely
on
their
possession
of
those
qualities
unless
they
proved
themselves
unworthy
of
it
,
which
worked
wonders
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
felt
that
we
had
a
part
in
the
management
of
the
place
,
and
in
sustaining
its
character
and
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
,
we
soon
became
warmly
attached
to
it
<EOS>
---
I
am
sure
I
did
for
one
,
and
I
never
knew
,
in
all
my
time
,
of
any
other
boy
being
otherwise
---
and
learnt
with
a
good
will
,
desiring
to
do
it
credit
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
noble
games
out
of
hours
,
and
plenty
of
liberty
;
but
even
then
,
as
I
remember
,
we
were
well
spoken
of
in
the
town
,
and
rarely
did
any
disgrace
,
by
our
appearance
or
manner
,
to
the
reputation
of
Doctor
Strong
and
Doctor
Strong
's
boys
.
   
<EOS>
Some
of
the
higher
scholars
boarded
in
the
Doctor
's
house
,
and
through
them
I
learned
,
at
second
hand
,
some
particulars
of
the
Doctor
's
history
---
as
,
how
he
had
not
yet
been
married
twelve
months
to
the
beautiful
young
lady
I
had
seen
in
the
study
,
whom
he
had
married
for
love
;
for
she
had
not
a
sixpence
,
and
had
a
world
of
poor
relations
(
so
our
fellows
said
)
ready
to
swarm
the
Doctor
out
of
house
and
home
.
 
<EOS>
Also
,
how
the
Doctor
's
cogitating
manner
was
attributable
to
his
being
always
engaged
in
looking
out
for
Greek
roots
;
which
,
in
my
innocence
and
ignorance
,
I
supposed
to
be
a
botanical
furor
on
the
Doctor
's
part
,
especially
as
he
always
looked
at
the
ground
when
he
walked
about
,
until
I
understood
that
they
were
roots
of
words
,
with
a
view
to
a
new
Dictionary
which
he
had
in
contemplation
.
 
<EOS>
Adams
,
our
head
-
boy
,
who
had
a
turn
for
mathematics
,
had
made
a
calculation
,
I
was
informed
,
of
the
time
this
Dictionary
would
take
in
completing
,
on
the
Doctor
's
plan
,
and
at
the
Doctor
's
rate
of
going
.
 
<EOS>
He
considered
that
it
might
be
done
in
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
forty
-
nine
years
,
counting
from
the
Doctor
's
last
,
or
sixty
-
second
,
birthday
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
Doctor
himself
was
the
idol
of
the
whole
school
:
and
it
must
have
been
a
badly
composed
school
if
he
had
been
anything
else
,
for
he
was
the
kindest
of
men
;
with
a
simple
faith
in
him
that
might
have
touched
the
stone
hearts
of
the
very
urns
upon
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
walked
up
and
down
that
part
of
the
courtyard
which
was
at
the
side
of
the
house
,
with
the
stray
rooks
and
jackdaws
looking
after
him
with
their
heads
cocked
slyly
,
as
if
they
knew
how
much
more
knowing
they
were
in
worldly
affairs
than
he
,
if
any
sort
of
vagabond
could
only
get
near
enough
to
his
creaking
shoes
to
attract
his
attention
to
one
sentence
of
a
tale
of
distress
,
that
vagabond
was
made
for
the
next
two
days
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
so
notorious
in
the
house
,
that
the
masters
and
head
-
boys
took
pains
to
cut
these
marauders
off
at
angles
,
and
to
get
out
of
windows
,
and
turn
them
out
of
the
courtyard
,
before
they
could
make
the
Doctor
aware
of
their
presence
;
which
was
sometimes
happily
effected
within
a
few
yards
of
him
,
without
his
knowing
anything
of
the
matter
,
as
he
jogged
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
Outside
his
own
domain
,
and
unprotected
,
he
was
a
very
sheep
for
the
shearers
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
taken
his
gaiters
off
his
legs
,
to
give
away
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
there
was
a
story
current
among
us
<EOS>
(
I
have
no
idea
,
and
never
had
,
on
what
authority
,
but
I
have
believed
it
for
so
many
years
that
I
feel
quite
certain
it
is
true
)
,
that
on
a
frosty
day
,
one
winter
-
time
,
he
actually
did
bestow
his
gaiters
on
a
beggar
-
woman
,
who
occasioned
some
scandal
in
the
neighbourhood
by
exhibiting
a
fine
infant
from
door
to
door
,
wrapped
in
those
garments
,
which
were
universally
recognized
,
being
as
well
known
in
the
vicinity
as
the
Cathedral
.
 
<EOS>
The
legend
added
that
the
only
person
who
did
not
identify
them
was
the
Doctor
himself
,
who
,
when
they
were
shortly
afterwards
displayed
at
the
door
of
a
little
second
-
hand
shop
of
no
very
good
repute
,
where
such
things
were
taken
in
exchange
for
gin
,
was
more
than
once
observed
to
handle
them
approvingly
,
as
if
admiring
some
curious
novelty
in
the
pattern
,
and
considering
them
an
improvement
on
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
very
pleasant
to
see
the
Doctor
with
his
pretty
young
wife
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
fatherly
,
benignant
way
of
showing
his
fondness
for
her
,
which
seemed
in
itself
to
express
a
good
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
saw
them
walking
in
the
garden
where
the
peaches
were
,
and
I
sometimes
had
a
nearer
observation
of
them
in
the
study
or
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
She
appeared
to
me
to
take
great
care
of
the
Doctor
,
and
to
like
him
very
much
,
though
I
never
thought
her
vitally
interested
in
the
Dictionary
:
some
cumbrous
fragments
of
which
work
the
Doctor
always
carried
in
his
pockets
,
and
in
the
lining
of
his
hat
,
and
generally
seemed
to
be
expounding
to
her
as
they
walked
about
.
   
<EOS>
I
saw
a
good
deal
of
Mrs
Strong
,
both
because
she
had
taken
a
liking
for
me
on
the
morning
of
my
introduction
to
the
Doctor
,
and
was
always
afterwards
kind
to
me
,
and
interested
in
me
;
and
because
she
was
very
fond
of
Agnes
,
and
was
often
backwards
and
forwards
at
our
house
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
curious
constraint
between
her
and
Mr
Wickfield
,
I
thought
(
of
whom
she
seemed
to
be
afraid
)
,
that
never
wore
off
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
came
there
of
an
evening
,
she
always
shrunk
from
accepting
his
escort
home
,
and
ran
away
with
me
instead
.
 
<EOS>
And
sometimes
,
as
we
were
running
gaily
across
the
Cathedral
yard
together
,
expecting
to
meet
nobody
,
we
would
meet
Mr
Jack
Maldon
,
who
was
always
surprised
to
see
us
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Strong
's
mama
was
a
lady
I
took
great
delight
in
.
 
<EOS>
Her
name
was
Mrs
Markleham
;
but
our
boys
used
to
call
her
the
Old
Soldier
,
on
account
of
her
generalship
,
and
the
skill
with
which
she
marshalled
great
forces
of
relations
against
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
little
,
sharp
-
eyed
woman
,
who
used
to
wear
,
when
she
was
dressed
,
one
unchangeable
cap
,
ornamented
with
some
artificial
flowers
,
and
two
artificial
butterflies
supposed
to
be
hovering
above
the
flowers
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
superstition
among
us
that
this
cap
had
come
from
France
,
and
could
only
originate
in
the
workmanship
of
that
ingenious
nation
:
but
all
I
certainly
know
about
it
,
is
,
that
it
always
made
its
appearance
of
an
evening
,
wheresoever
Mrs
Markleham
made
HER
appearance
;
that
it
was
carried
about
to
friendly
meetings
in
a
Hindoo
basket
;
that
the
butterflies
had
the
gift
of
trembling
constantly
;
and
that
they
improved
the
shining
hours
at
Doctor
Strong
's
expense
,
like
busy
bees
.
   
<EOS>
I
observed
the
Old
Soldier
---
not
to
adopt
the
name
disrespectfully
---
to
pretty
good
advantage
,
on
a
night
which
is
made
memorable
to
me
by
something
else
I
shall
relate
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
night
of
a
little
party
at
the
Doctor
's
,
which
was
given
on
the
occasion
of
Mr
Jack
Maldon
's
departure
for
India
,
whither
he
was
going
as
a
cadet
,
or
something
of
that
kind
:
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
having
at
length
arranged
the
business
.
 
<EOS>
It
happened
to
be
the
Doctor
's
birthday
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
had
a
holiday
,
had
made
presents
to
him
in
the
morning
,
had
made
a
speech
to
him
through
the
head
-
boy
,
and
had
cheered
him
until
we
were
hoarse
,
and
until
he
had
shed
tears
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
in
the
evening
,
Mr
Wickfield
,
Agnes
,
and
I
,
went
to
have
tea
with
him
in
his
private
capacity
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jack
Maldon
was
there
,
before
us
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Strong
,
dressed
in
white
,
with
cherry
-
coloured
ribbons
,
was
playing
the
piano
,
when
we
went
in
;
and
he
was
leaning
over
her
to
turn
the
leaves
.
 
<EOS>
The
clear
red
and
white
of
her
complexion
was
not
so
blooming
and
flower
-
like
as
usual
<EOS>
,
I
thought
,
when
she
turned
round
;
but
she
looked
very
pretty
,
Wonderfully
pretty
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
forgotten
,
Doctor
,
"
said
Mrs
Strong
's
mama
,
when
we
were
seated
,
"
to
pay
you
the
compliments
of
the
day
---
though
they
are
,
as
you
may
suppose
,
very
far
from
being
mere
compliments
in
my
case
.
 
<EOS>
Allow
me
to
wish
you
many
happy
returns
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
the
Doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Many
,
many
,
many
,
happy
returns
,
"
said
the
Old
Soldier
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
only
for
your
own
sake
,
but
for
Annie
's
,
and
John
Maldon
's
,
and
many
other
people
's
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
but
yesterday
to
me
,
John
,
when
you
were
a
little
creature
,
a
head
shorter
than
Master
Copperfield
,
making
baby
love
to
Annie
behind
the
gooseberry
bushes
in
the
back
-
garden
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
mama
,
"
said
Mrs
Strong
,
"
never
mind
that
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Annie
,
do
n't
be
absurd
,
"
returned
her
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
to
blush
to
hear
of
such
things
now
you
are
an
old
married
woman
,
when
are
you
not
to
blush
to
hear
of
them
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Old
?
"
exclaimed
Mr
Jack
Maldon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Annie
?
 
<EOS>
Come
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
John
,
"
returned
the
Soldier
.
 
<EOS>
"
Virtually
,
an
old
married
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Although
not
old
by
years
---
for
when
did
you
ever
hear
me
say
,
or
who
has
ever
heard
me
say
,
that
a
girl
of
twenty
was
old
by
years
!
<EOS>
---
your
cousin
is
the
wife
of
the
Doctor
,
and
,
as
such
,
what
I
have
described
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
well
for
you
,
John
,
that
your
cousin
is
the
wife
of
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
found
in
him
an
influential
and
kind
friend
,
who
will
be
kinder
yet
<EOS>
,
I
venture
to
predict
,
if
you
deserve
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
false
pride
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
hesitate
to
admit
,
frankly
,
that
there
are
some
members
of
our
family
who
want
a
friend
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
one
yourself
,
before
your
cousin
's
influence
raised
up
one
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
,
in
the
goodness
of
his
heart
,
waved
his
hand
as
if
to
make
light
of
it
,
and
save
Mr
Jack
Maldon
from
any
further
reminder
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Markleham
changed
her
chair
for
one
next
the
Doctor
's
,
and
putting
her
fan
on
his
coat
-
sleeve
,
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
No
,
really
,
my
dear
Doctor
,
you
must
excuse
me
if
I
appear
to
dwell
on
this
rather
,
because
I
feel
so
very
strongly
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
it
quite
my
monomania
,
it
is
such
a
subject
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
blessing
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
You
really
are
a
Boon
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
nonsense
,
"
said
the
Doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
retorted
the
Old
Soldier
.
 
<EOS>
"
With
nobody
present
,
but
our
dear
and
confidential
friend
Mr
Wickfield
,
I
can
not
consent
to
be
put
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
begin
to
assert
the
privileges
of
a
mother
-
in
-
law
,
if
you
go
on
like
that
,
and
scold
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
perfectly
honest
and
outspoken
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
am
saying
,
is
what
I
said
when
you
first
overpowered
me
with
surprise
---
you
remember
how
surprised
I
was
?
---
by
proposing
for
Annie
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
there
was
anything
so
very
much
out
of
the
way
,
in
the
mere
fact
of
the
proposal
---
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
say
that
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
but
because
,
you
having
known
her
poor
father
,
and
having
known
her
from
a
baby
six
months
old
,
I
had
n't
thought
of
you
in
such
a
light
at
all
,
or
indeed
as
a
marrying
man
in
any
way
,
---
simply
that
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
"
returned
the
Doctor
,
good
-
humouredly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
DO
mind
,
"
said
the
Old
Soldier
,
laying
her
fan
upon
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
mind
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
recall
these
things
that
I
may
be
contradicted
if
I
am
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
Then
I
spoke
to
Annie
,
and
I
told
her
what
had
happened
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
My
dear
,
here
's
<EOS>
Doctor
Strong
has
positively
been
and
made
you
the
subject
of
a
handsome
declaration
and
an
offer
.
<EOS>
"
Did
I
press
it
in
the
least
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
Now
,
Annie
,
tell
me
the
truth
this
moment
;
is
your
heart
free
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mama
,
"
she
said
crying
,
"
I
am
extremely
young
"
---
which
was
perfectly
true
---
"
<EOS>
and
I
hardly
know
if
I
have
a
heart
at
all
.
"
<EOS>
"
Then
,
my
dear
,
"
I
said
,
"
you
may
rely
upon
it
,
it
's
free
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
my
love
,
"
said
I
,
"
Doctor
Strong
is
in
an
agitated
state
of
mind
,
and
must
be
answered
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
not
be
kept
in
his
present
state
of
suspense
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mama
,
"
said
Annie
,
still
crying
,
"
would
he
be
unhappy
without
me
?
 
<EOS>
If
he
would
,
I
honour
and
respect
him
so
much
,
that
I
think
I
will
have
him
.
"
<EOS>
So
it
was
settled
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
and
not
till
then
<EOS>
,
I
said
to
Annie
,
"
Annie
,
Doctor
Strong
will
not
only
be
your
husband
,
but
he
will
represent
your
late
father
:
he
will
represent
the
head
of
our
family
,
he
will
represent
the
wisdom
and
station
,
and
I
may
say
the
means
,
of
our
family
;
and
will
be
,
in
short
,
a
Boon
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
used
the
word
at
the
time
,
and
I
have
used
it
again
,
today
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
have
any
merit
it
is
consistency
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
daughter
had
sat
quite
silent
and
still
during
this
speech
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
;
her
cousin
standing
near
her
,
and
looking
on
the
ground
too
.
 
<EOS>
She
now
said
very
softly
,
in
a
trembling
voice
:
   
<EOS>
"
Mama
,
I
hope
you
have
finished
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
Annie
,
"
returned
the
Old
Soldier
,
"
I
have
not
quite
finished
.
 
<EOS>
Since
you
ask
me
,
my
love
,
I
reply
that
I
have
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
complain
that
you
really
are
a
little
unnatural
towards
your
own
family
;
and
,
as
it
is
of
no
use
complaining
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
to
complain
to
your
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
Doctor
,
do
look
at
that
silly
wife
of
yours
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
Doctor
turned
his
kind
face
,
with
its
smile
of
simplicity
and
gentleness
,
towards
her
,
she
drooped
her
head
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
noticed
that
Mr
Wickfield
looked
at
her
steadily
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
happened
to
say
to
that
naughty
thing
,
the
other
day
,
"
pursued
her
mother
,
shaking
her
head
and
her
fan
at
her
,
playfully
,
"
that
there
was
a
family
circumstance
she
might
mention
to
you
---
indeed
,
I
think
,
was
bound
to
mention
---
she
said
,
that
to
mention
it
was
to
ask
a
favour
;
and
that
,
as
you
were
too
generous
,
and
as
for
her
to
ask
was
always
to
have
,
she
would
n't
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Annie
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
was
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
It
robbed
me
of
a
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Almost
the
very
words
I
said
to
her
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
her
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
really
,
another
time
,
when
I
know
what
she
would
tell
you
but
for
this
reason
,
and
wo
n't
,
I
have
a
great
mind
,
my
dear
Doctor
,
to
tell
you
myself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
,
"
returned
the
Doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Certainly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
I
will
!
"
said
the
Old
Soldier
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
bargain
.
"
<EOS>
And
having
,
I
suppose
,
carried
her
point
,
she
tapped
the
Doctor
's
hand
several
times
with
her
fan
(
which
she
kissed
first
)
,
and
returned
triumphantly
to
her
former
station
.
   
<EOS>
Some
more
company
coming
in
,
among
whom
were
the
two
masters
and
Adams
,
the
talk
became
general
;
and
it
naturally
turned
on
Mr
Jack
Maldon
,
and
his
voyage
,
and
the
country
he
was
going
to
,
and
his
various
plans
and
prospects
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
to
leave
that
night
,
after
supper
,
in
a
post
-
chaise
,
for
Gravesend
;
where
the
ship
,
in
which
he
was
to
make
the
voyage
,
lay
;
and
was
to
be
gone
---
unless
he
came
home
on
leave
,
or
for
his
health
<EOS>
---
I
do
n't
know
<EOS>
how
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
it
was
settled
by
general
consent
that
India
was
quite
a
misrepresented
country
,
and
had
nothing
objectionable
in
it
,
but
a
tiger
or
two
,
and
a
little
heat
in
the
warm
part
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
looked
on
Mr
Jack
Maldon
as
a
modern
Sindbad
,
and
pictured
him
the
bosom
friend
of
all
the
Rajahs
in
the
East
,
sitting
under
canopies
,
smoking
curly
golden
pipes
---
a
mile
long
,
if
they
could
be
straightened
out
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Strong
was
a
very
pretty
singer
:
as
I
knew
,
who
often
heard
her
singing
by
herself
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
whether
she
was
afraid
of
singing
before
people
,
or
was
out
of
voice
that
evening
,
it
was
certain
that
she
could
n't
sing
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
She
tried
a
duet
,
once
,
with
her
cousin
Maldon
,
but
could
not
so
much
as
begin
;
and
afterwards
,
when
she
tried
to
sing
by
herself
,
although
she
began
sweetly
,
her
voice
died
away
on
a
sudden
,
and
left
her
quite
distressed
,
with
her
head
hanging
down
over
the
keys
.
 
<EOS>
The
good
Doctor
said
she
was
nervous
,
and
,
to
relieve
her
,
proposed
a
round
game
at
cards
;
of
which
he
knew
as
much
as
of
the
art
of
playing
the
trombone
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
remarked
that
the
Old
Soldier
took
him
into
custody
directly
,
for
her
partner
;
and
instructed
him
,
as
the
first
preliminary
of
initiation
,
to
give
her
all
the
silver
he
had
in
his
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
a
merry
game
,
not
made
the
less
merry
by
the
Doctor
's
mistakes
,
of
which
he
committed
an
innumerable
quantity
,
in
spite
of
the
watchfulness
of
the
butterflies
,
and
to
their
great
aggravation
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Strong
had
declined
to
play
,
on
the
ground
of
not
feeling
very
well
;
and
her
cousin
Maldon
had
excused
himself
because
he
had
some
packing
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
done
it
,
however
,
he
returned
,
and
they
sat
together
,
talking
,
on
the
sofa
.
 
<EOS>
From
time
to
time
she
came
and
looked
over
the
Doctor
's
hand
,
and
told
him
what
to
play
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
very
pale
,
as
she
bent
over
him
,
and
I
thought
her
finger
trembled
as
she
pointed
out
the
cards
;
but
the
Doctor
was
quite
happy
in
her
attention
,
and
took
no
notice
of
this
,
if
it
were
so
.
   
<EOS>
At
supper
,
we
were
hardly
so
gay
.
 
<EOS>
Everyone
appeared
to
feel
that
a
parting
of
that
sort
was
an
awkward
thing
,
and
that
the
nearer
it
approached
,
the
more
awkward
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jack
Maldon
tried
to
be
very
talkative
,
but
was
not
at
his
ease
,
and
made
matters
worse
.
<EOS>
And
they
were
not
improved
,
as
it
appeared
to
me
,
by
the
Old
Soldier
:
who
continually
recalled
passages
of
Mr
Jack
Maldon
's
youth
.
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
,
however
,
who
felt
,
I
am
sure
,
that
he
was
making
everybody
happy
,
was
well
pleased
,
and
had
no
suspicion
<EOS>
but
that
we
were
all
at
the
utmost
height
of
enjoyment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Annie
,
my
dear
,
"
said
he
,
looking
at
his
watch
,
and
filling
his
glass
,
"
it
is
past
your
cousin
jack
's
time
,
and
we
must
not
detain
him
,
since
time
and
tide
---
both
concerned
in
this
case
---
wait
for
no
man
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jack
Maldon
,
you
have
a
long
voyage
,
and
a
strange
country
,
before
you
;
but
many
men
have
had
both
,
and
many
men
will
have
both
,
to
the
end
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
winds
you
are
going
to
tempt
,
have
wafted
thousands
upon
thousands
to
fortune
,
and
brought
thousands
upon
thousands
happily
back
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
an
affecting
thing
,
"
said
Mrs
Markleham
---
"
<EOS>
however
it
's
viewed
,
it
's
affecting
,
to
see
a
fine
young
man
one
has
known
from
an
infant
,
going
away
to
the
other
end
of
the
world
,
leaving
all
he
knows
behind
,
and
not
knowing
what
's
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
A
young
man
really
well
deserves
constant
support
and
patronage
,
"
looking
at
the
Doctor
,
"
who
makes
such
sacrifices
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Time
will
go
fast
with
you
,
Mr
Jack
Maldon
,
"
pursued
the
Doctor
,
"
and
fast
with
all
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
us
can
hardly
expect
,
perhaps
,
in
the
natural
course
of
things
,
to
greet
you
on
your
return
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
best
thing
is
to
hope
to
do
it
,
and
that
's
my
case
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
not
weary
you
with
good
advice
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
long
had
a
good
model
before
you
,
in
your
cousin
Annie
.
 
<EOS>
Imitate
her
virtues
as
nearly
as
you
can
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Markleham
fanned
herself
,
and
shook
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
Mr
Jack
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
standing
up
;
on
which
we
all
stood
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
prosperous
voyage
out
,
a
thriving
career
abroad
,
and
a
happy
return
home
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
all
drank
the
toast
,
and
all
shook
hands
with
Mr
Jack
Maldon
;
after
which
he
hastily
took
leave
of
the
ladies
who
were
there
,
and
hurried
to
the
door
,
where
he
was
received
,
as
he
got
into
the
chaise
,
with
a
tremendous
broadside
of
cheers
discharged
by
our
boys
,
who
had
assembled
on
the
lawn
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Running
in
among
them
to
swell
the
ranks
,
I
was
very
near
the
chaise
when
it
rolled
away
;
and
I
had
a
lively
impression
made
upon
me
,
in
the
midst
of
the
noise
and
dust
,
of
having
seen
Mr
Jack
Maldon
rattle
past
with
an
agitated
face
,
and
something
cherry
-
coloured
in
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
After
another
broadside
for
the
Doctor
,
and
another
for
the
Doctor
's
wife
,
the
boys
dispersed
,
and
I
went
back
into
the
house
,
where
I
found
the
guests
all
standing
in
a
group
about
the
Doctor
,
discussing
how
Mr
Jack
Maldon
had
gone
away
,
and
how
he
had
borne
it
,
and
how
he
had
felt
it
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
these
remarks
,
Mrs
Markleham
cried
:
"
Where
's
Annie
?
"
   
<EOS>
No
Annie
was
there
;
and
when
they
called
to
her
,
no
Annie
replied
.
<EOS>
But
all
pressing
out
of
the
room
,
in
a
crowd
,
to
see
what
was
the
matter
,
we
found
her
lying
on
the
hall
floor
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
great
alarm
at
first
,
until
it
was
found
that
she
was
in
a
swoon
,
and
that
the
swoon
was
yielding
to
the
usual
means
of
recovery
;
when
the
Doctor
,
who
had
lifted
her
head
upon
his
knee
,
put
her
curls
aside
with
his
hand
,
and
said
,
looking
around
:
   
"
Poor
Annie
!
 
<EOS>
She
's
so
faithful
and
tender
-
hearted
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
the
parting
from
her
old
playfellow
and
friend
---
her
favourite
cousin
<EOS>
---
that
has
done
this
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
pity
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
sorry
!
"
   
<EOS>
When
she
opened
her
eyes
,
and
saw
where
she
was
,
and
that
we
were
all
standing
about
her
,
she
arose
with
assistance
:
turning
her
head
,
as
she
did
so
,
to
lay
it
on
the
Doctor
's
shoulder
---
or
to
hide
it
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
which
.
 
<EOS>
We
went
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
to
leave
her
with
the
Doctor
and
her
mother
;
but
she
said
,
it
seemed
,
that
she
was
better
than
she
had
been
since
morning
,
and
that
she
would
rather
be
brought
among
us
;
<EOS>
so
they
brought
her
in
,
looking
very
white
and
weak
,
I
thought
,
and
sat
her
on
a
sofa
.
   
<EOS>
"
Annie
,
my
dear
,
"
said
her
mother
,
doing
something
to
her
dress
.
<EOS>
"
See
here
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
lost
a
bow
.
 
<EOS>
Will
anybody
be
so
good
as
find
a
ribbon
;
a
cherry
-
coloured
ribbon
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
one
she
had
worn
at
her
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
looked
for
it
;
I
myself
looked
everywhere
<EOS>
,
I
am
certain
---
but
nobody
could
find
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
recollect
where
you
had
it
last
,
Annie
?
"
said
her
mother
.
   
<EOS>
I
wondered
how
I
could
have
thought
she
looked
white
,
or
<EOS>
anything
but
burning
red
,
when
she
answered
that
she
had
had
it
safe
,
a
little
while
ago
<EOS>
,
she
thought
,
but
it
was
not
worth
looking
for
.
   
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
it
was
looked
for
again
,
and
still
not
found
.
 
<EOS>
She
entreated
that
there
might
be
no
more
searching
;
but
it
was
still
sought
for
,
in
a
desultory
way
,
until
she
was
quite
well
,
and
the
company
took
their
departure
.
   
<EOS>
We
walked
very
slowly
home
,
Mr
Wickfield
,
Agnes
,
and
I
---
<EOS>
Agnes
and
<EOS>
I
admiring
the
moonlight
,
and
Mr
Wickfield
scarcely
raising
his
eyes
from
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
,
at
last
,
reached
our
own
door
,
Agnes
discovered
that
she
had
left
her
little
reticule
behind
.
<EOS>
Delighted
to
be
of
any
service
to
her
,
I
ran
back
to
fetch
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
went
into
the
supper
-
room
where
it
had
been
left
,
which
was
deserted
and
dark
.
 
<EOS>
But
a
door
of
communication
between
that
and
the
Doctor
's
study
,
where
there
was
a
light
,
being
open
<EOS>
,
I
passed
on
there
,
to
say
what
I
wanted
,
and
to
get
a
candle
.
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
was
sitting
in
his
easy
-
chair
by
the
fireside
,
and
his
young
wife
was
on
a
stool
at
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
The
Doctor
,
with
a
complacent
smile
,
was
reading
aloud
some
manuscript
explanation
or
statement
of
a
theory
out
of
that
interminable
Dictionary
,
and
she
was
looking
up
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
with
such
a
face
as
I
never
saw
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
so
beautiful
in
its
form
,
it
was
so
ashy
pale
,
it
was
so
fixed
in
its
abstraction
<EOS>
,
it
was
so
full
of
a
wild
,
sleep
-
walking
,
dreamy
horror
of
I
do
n't
know
what
.
 
<EOS>
The
eyes
were
wide
open
,
and
her
brown
hair
fell
in
two
rich
clusters
on
her
shoulders
,
and
on
her
white
dress
,
disordered
by
the
want
of
the
lost
ribbon
.
 
<EOS>
Distinctly
as
I
recollect
her
look
,
I
can
not
say
of
what
it
was
expressive
,
I
can
not
even
say
of
what
it
is
expressive
to
me
now
,
rising
again
before
my
older
judgement
.
 
<EOS>
Penitence
,
humiliation
,
shame
,
pride
,
love
,
and
trustfulness
<EOS>
---
I
see
them
all
;
and
in
them
all
,
I
see
that
horror
of
I
do
n't
know
what
.
   
<EOS>
My
entrance
,
and
my
saying
what
I
wanted
,
roused
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
disturbed
the
Doctor
too
,
for
when
I
went
back
to
replace
the
candle
I
had
taken
from
the
table
,
he
was
patting
her
head
,
in
his
fatherly
way
,
and
saying
he
was
a
merciless
drone
to
let
her
tempt
him
into
reading
on
;
and
he
would
have
her
go
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
But
she
asked
him
,
in
a
rapid
,
urgent
manner
,
to
let
her
stay
---
to
let
her
feel
assured
<EOS>
(
I
heard
her
murmur
some
broken
words
to
this
effect
)
that
she
was
in
his
confidence
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
as
she
turned
again
towards
him
,
after
glancing
at
me
as
I
left
the
room
and
went
out
at
the
door
,
I
saw
her
cross
her
hands
upon
his
knee
,
and
look
up
at
him
with
the
same
face
,
something
quieted
,
as
he
resumed
his
reading
.
   
<EOS>
It
made
a
great
impression
on
me
,
and
I
remembered
it
a
long
time
afterwards
;
as
I
shall
have
occasion
to
narrate
when
the
time
comes
.
      
<EOS>
Chapter
17
.
<EOS>
Somebody
turns
up
 
It
has
not
occurred
to
me
to
mention
Peggotty
since
I
ran
away
;
but
,
of
course
,
I
wrote
her
a
letter
almost
as
soon
as
I
was
housed
at
Dover
,
and
another
,
and
a
longer
letter
,
containing
all
particulars
fully
related
,
when
my
aunt
took
me
formally
under
her
protection
.
 
<EOS>
On
my
being
settled
at
Doctor
Strong
's
I
wrote
to
her
again
,
detailing
my
happy
condition
and
prospects
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
could
have
derived
anything
like
the
pleasure
from
spending
the
money
Mr
Dick
had
given
me
,
that
I
felt
in
sending
a
gold
half
-
guinea
to
Peggotty
,
per
post
,
enclosed
in
this
last
letter
,
to
discharge
the
sum
I
had
borrowed
of
her
:
in
which
epistle
,
not
before
,
I
mentioned
about
the
young
man
with
the
donkey
-
cart
.
   
<EOS>
To
these
communications
<EOS>
Peggotty
replied
as
promptly
,
if
not
as
concisely
,
as
a
merchant
's
clerk
.
 
<EOS>
Her
utmost
powers
of
expression
(
which
were
certainly
not
great
in
ink
)
were
exhausted
in
the
attempt
to
write
what
she
felt
on
the
subject
of
my
journey
.
 
<EOS>
Four
sides
of
incoherent
and
interjectional
beginnings
of
sentences
,
that
had
no
end
,
except
blots
,
were
inadequate
to
afford
her
any
relief
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
blots
were
more
expressive
to
me
than
the
best
composition
;
for
they
showed
me
that
Peggotty
had
been
crying
all
over
the
paper
,
and
what
could
I
have
desired
more
?
   
<EOS>
I
made
out
,
without
much
difficulty
,
that
she
could
not
take
quite
kindly
to
my
aunt
yet
.
 
<EOS>
The
notice
was
too
short
after
so
long
a
prepossession
the
other
way
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
knew
a
person
,
she
wrote
;
but
to
think
that
Miss
Betsey
should
seem
to
be
so
different
from
what
she
had
been
thought
to
be
,
was
a
Moral
!
<EOS>
---
that
was
her
word
.
<EOS>
She
was
evidently
still
afraid
of
Miss
Betsey
,
for
she
sent
her
grateful
duty
to
her
but
timidly
;
and
she
was
evidently
afraid
of
me
,
too
,
and
entertained
the
probability
of
my
running
away
again
soon
:
if
I
might
judge
from
the
repeated
hints
she
threw
out
,
that
the
coach
-
fare
to
Yarmouth
was
always
to
be
had
of
her
for
the
asking
.
   
<EOS>
She
gave
me
one
piece
of
intelligence
which
affected
me
very
much
,
namely
,
that
there
had
been
a
sale
of
the
furniture
at
our
old
home
,
and
that
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
were
gone
away
,
and
the
house
was
shut
up
,
to
be
let
or
sold
.
 
<EOS>
God
knows
I
had
no
part
in
it
while
they
remained
there
,
but
it
pained
me
to
think
of
the
dear
old
place
as
altogether
abandoned
;
of
the
weeds
growing
tall
in
the
garden
,
and
the
fallen
leaves
lying
thick
and
wet
upon
the
paths
.
<EOS>
I
imagined
how
the
winds
of
winter
would
howl
round
it
,
how
the
cold
rain
would
beat
upon
the
window
-
glass
,
how
the
moon
would
make
ghosts
on
the
walls
of
the
empty
rooms
,
watching
their
solitude
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
afresh
of
the
grave
in
the
churchyard
,
underneath
the
tree
:
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
house
were
dead
too
,
now
,
and
all
connected
with
my
father
and
mother
were
faded
away
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
other
news
in
Peggotty
's
letters
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
was
an
excellent
husband
,
she
said
,
though
still
a
little
near
;
but
we
all
had
our
faults
,
and
she
had
plenty
(
though
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
what
they
were
)
;
and
he
sent
his
duty
,
and
my
little
bedroom
was
always
ready
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
was
well
,
and
Ham
was
well
,
and
Mrs.
 
Gummidge
was
but
poorly
,
and
little
Em'ly
would
n't
send
her
love
,
but
said
that
Peggotty
might
send
it
,
if
she
liked
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
intelligence
I
dutifully
imparted
to
my
aunt
,
only
reserving
to
myself
the
mention
of
little
Em'ly
,
to
whom
I
instinctively
felt
that
she
would
not
very
tenderly
incline
.
 
<EOS>
While
I
was
yet
new
at
Doctor
Strong
's
,
she
made
several
excursions
over
to
Canterbury
to
see
me
,
and
always
at
unseasonable
hours
:
with
the
view
,
I
suppose
,
of
taking
me
by
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
finding
me
well
employed
,
and
bearing
a
good
character
,
and
hearing
on
all
hands
that
I
rose
fast
in
the
school
,
she
soon
discontinued
these
visits
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
on
a
Saturday
,
every
third
or
fourth
week
,
when
I
went
over
to
Dover
for
a
treat
;
and
I
saw
Mr
Dick
every
alternate
Wednesday
,
when
he
arrived
by
stage
-
coach
at
noon
,
to
stay
until
next
morning
.
   
<EOS>
On
these
occasions
Mr
Dick
never
travelled
without
a
leathern
writing
-
desk
,
containing
a
supply
of
stationery
and
the
Memorial
;
in
relation
to
which
document
he
had
a
notion
that
time
was
beginning
to
press
now
,
and
that
it
really
must
be
got
out
of
hand
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
was
very
partial
to
gingerbread
.
 
<EOS>
To
render
his
visits
the
more
agreeable
,
my
aunt
had
instructed
me
to
open
a
credit
for
him
at
a
cake
shop
,
which
was
hampered
with
the
stipulation
that
he
should
not
be
served
with
more
than
one
shilling's
-
worth
in
the
course
of
any
one
day
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
and
the
reference
of
all
his
little
bills
at
the
county
inn
where
he
slept
,
to
my
aunt
,
before
they
were
paid
,
induced
me
to
suspect
that
he
was
only
allowed
to
rattle
his
money
,
and
not
to
spend
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
on
further
investigation
that
this
was
so
,
or
at
least
there
was
an
agreement
between
him
and
my
aunt
that
he
should
account
to
her
for
all
his
disbursements
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
had
no
idea
of
deceiving
her
,
and
always
desired
to
please
her
,
he
was
thus
made
chary
of
launching
into
expense
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
point
,
as
well
as
on
all
other
possible
points
,
Mr
Dick
was
convinced
that
my
aunt
was
the
wisest
and
most
wonderful
of
women
;
as
he
repeatedly
told
me
with
infinite
secrecy
,
and
always
in
a
whisper
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trotwood
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
with
an
air
of
mystery
,
after
imparting
this
confidence
to
me
,
one
Wednesday
;
"
who
's
the
man
that
hides
near
our
house
and
frightens
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Frightens
my
aunt
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
nodded
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
nothing
would
have
frightened
her
,
"
he
said
,
"
for
she
's
---
"
<EOS>
here
he
whispered
softly
,
"
do
n't
mention
it
---
<EOS>
the
wisest
and
most
wonderful
of
women
.
"
 
<EOS>
Having
said
which
,
he
drew
back
,
to
observe
the
effect
which
this
description
of
her
made
upon
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
first
time
he
came
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
"
was
---
<EOS>
let
me
see
---
<EOS>
sixteen
hundred
and
forty
-
nine
was
the
date
of
King
Charles
's
execution
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
said
sixteen
hundred
and
forty
-
nine
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
it
can
be
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
sorely
puzzled
and
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
am
as
old
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Was
it
in
that
year
that
the
man
appeared
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
really
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
"
I
do
n't
see
how
it
can
have
been
in
that
year
,
Trotwood
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
get
that
date
out
of
history
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
history
never
lies
,
does
it
?
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
with
a
gleam
of
hope
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
,
no
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
replied
,
most
decisively
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
ingenuous
and
young
,
and
I
thought
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
make
it
out
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
something
wrong
,
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
it
was
very
soon
after
the
mistake
was
made
of
putting
some
of
the
trouble
out
of
King
Charles
's
head
into
my
head
,
that
the
man
first
came
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
walking
out
with
Miss
Trotwood
after
tea
,
just
at
dark
,
and
there
he
was
,
close
to
our
house
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Walking
about
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
Walking
about
?
"
repeated
Mr
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
,
I
must
recollect
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
N
-
<EOS>
no
,
no
;
he
was
not
walking
about
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
asked
,
as
the
shortest
way
to
get
at
it
,
what
he
WAS
doing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
he
was
n't
there
at
all
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
"
until
he
came
up
behind
her
,
and
whispered
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
turned
round
and
fainted
,
and
I
stood
still
and
looked
at
him
,
and
he
walked
away
;
but
that
he
should
have
been
hiding
ever
since
(
in
the
ground
or
somewhere
)
,
is
the
most
extraordinary
thing
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
HAS
he
been
hiding
ever
since
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
he
has
,
"
retorted
Mr
Dick
,
nodding
his
head
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Never
came
out
,
till
last
night
!
 
<EOS>
We
were
walking
last
night
,
and
he
came
up
behind
her
again
,
and
I
knew
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
did
he
frighten
my
aunt
again
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
of
a
shiver
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
counterfeiting
that
affection
and
making
his
teeth
chatter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Held
by
the
palings
.
 
<EOS>
Cried
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Trotwood
,
come
here
,
"
getting
me
close
to
him
,
that
he
might
whisper
very
softly
;
"
why
did
she
give
him
money
,
boy
,
in
the
moonlight
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
a
beggar
,
perhaps
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
shook
his
head
,
as
utterly
renouncing
the
suggestion
;
and
having
replied
a
great
many
times
,
and
with
great
confidence
,
"
No
beggar
,
no
beggar
,
no
beggar
,
sir
!
"
went
on
to
say
,
that
from
his
window
he
had
afterwards
,
and
late
at
night
,
seen
my
aunt
give
this
person
money
outside
the
garden
rails
in
the
moonlight
,
who
then
slunk
away
---
into
the
ground
again
,
as
he
thought
probable
---
and
was
seen
no
more
:
while
my
aunt
came
hurriedly
and
secretly
back
into
the
house
,
and
had
,
even
that
morning
,
been
quite
different
from
her
usual
self
;
which
preyed
on
Mr
Dick
's
mind
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
not
the
least
belief
,
in
the
outset
of
this
story
,
that
the
unknown
was
anything
but
a
delusion
of
Mr
Dick
's
,
and
one
of
the
line
of
that
ill
-
fated
Prince
who
occasioned
him
so
much
difficulty
;
but
after
some
reflection
I
began
to
entertain
the
question
whether
an
attempt
,
or
threat
of
an
attempt
,
might
have
been
twice
made
to
take
poor
Mr
Dick
himself
from
under
my
aunt
's
protection
,
and
whether
my
aunt
,
the
strength
of
whose
kind
feeling
towards
him
I
knew
from
herself
,
might
have
been
induced
to
pay
a
price
for
his
peace
and
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
was
already
much
attached
to
Mr
Dick
,
and
very
solicitous
for
his
welfare
,
my
fears
favoured
this
supposition
;
and
for
a
long
time
his
Wednesday
hardly
ever
came
round
,
without
my
entertaining
a
misgiving
that
he
would
not
be
on
the
coach
-
box
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
There
he
always
appeared
,
however
,
grey
-
headed
,
laughing
,
and
happy
;
and
he
never
had
anything
more
to
tell
of
the
man
who
could
frighten
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
These
Wednesdays
were
the
happiest
days
of
Mr
Dick
's
life
;
they
were
far
from
being
the
least
happy
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
became
known
to
every
boy
in
the
school
;
and
though
he
never
took
an
active
part
in
any
game
but
kite
-
flying
,
was
as
deeply
interested
in
all
our
sports
as
anyone
among
us
.
 
<EOS>
How
often
have
I
seen
him
,
intent
upon
a
match
at
marbles
or
pegtop
,
looking
on
with
a
face
of
unutterable
interest
,
and
hardly
breathing
at
the
critical
times
!
 
<EOS>
How
often
,
at
hare
and
hounds
,
have
I
seen
him
mounted
on
a
little
knoll
,
cheering
the
whole
field
on
to
action
,
and
waving
his
hat
above
his
grey
head
,
oblivious
of
King
Charles
the
Martyr
's
head
,
and
all
belonging
to
it
!
 
<EOS>
How
many
a
summer
hour
have
I
known
to
be
but
<EOS>
blissful
minutes
to
him
in
the
cricket
-
field
!
 
<EOS>
How
many
winter
days
have
I
seen
him
,
standing
blue
-
nosed
,
in
the
snow
and
east
wind
,
looking
at
the
boys
going
down
the
long
slide
,
and
clapping
his
worsted
gloves
in
rapture
!
   
<EOS>
He
was
an
universal
favourite
,
and
his
ingenuity
in
little
things
was
transcendent
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
cut
oranges
into
such
devices
as
none
of
us
had
an
idea
of
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
make
a
boat
out
of
anything
,
from
a
skewer
upwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
turn
cramp
-
bones
into
chessmen
;
fashion
Roman
chariots
from
old
court
cards
;
make
spoked
wheels
out
of
cotton
reels
,
and
bird
-
cages
of
old
wire
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
greatest
of
all
<EOS>
,
perhaps
,
in
the
articles
of
string
and
straw
;
with
which
we
were
all
persuaded
he
could
do
anything
that
could
be
done
by
hands
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
's
renown
was
not
long
confined
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
few
Wednesdays
,
Doctor
Strong
himself
made
some
inquiries
of
me
about
him
,
and
I
told
him
all
my
aunt
had
told
me
;
which
interested
the
Doctor
so
much
that
he
requested
,
on
the
occasion
of
his
next
visit
,
to
be
presented
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
ceremony
I
performed
;
and
the
Doctor
begging
Mr
Dick
,
whensoever
he
should
not
find
me
at
the
coach
office
,
to
come
on
there
,
and
rest
himself
until
our
morning
's
work
was
over
,
it
soon
passed
into
a
custom
for
Mr
Dick
to
come
on
as
a
matter
of
course
,
and
,
if
we
were
a
little
late
,
as
often
happened
on
a
Wednesday
,
to
walk
about
the
courtyard
,
waiting
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Here
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
Doctor
's
beautiful
young
wife
(
paler
than
formerly
,
all
this
time
;
more
rarely
seen
by
me
or
anyone
,
I
think
;
and
not
so
gay
,
but
not
less
beautiful
)
,
and
so
became
more
and
more
familiar
by
degrees
,
until
,
at
last
,
he
would
come
into
the
school
and
wait
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
sat
in
a
particular
corner
,
on
a
particular
stool
,
which
was
called
"
Dick
"
,
after
him
;
here
he
would
sit
,
with
his
grey
head
bent
forward
,
attentively
listening
to
whatever
might
be
going
on
,
with
a
profound
veneration
for
the
learning
he
had
never
been
able
to
acquire
.
   
<EOS>
This
veneration
Mr
Dick
extended
to
the
Doctor
,
whom
he
thought
the
most
subtle
and
accomplished
philosopher
of
any
age
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
long
before
Mr
Dick
ever
spoke
to
him
otherwise
than
bareheaded
;
and
even
when
he
and
the
Doctor
had
struck
up
quite
a
friendship
,
and
would
walk
together
by
the
hour
,
on
that
side
of
the
courtyard
which
was
known
among
us
as
The
Doctor
's
Walk
,
Mr
Dick
would
pull
off
his
hat
at
intervals
to
show
his
respect
for
wisdom
and
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
How
it
ever
came
about
that
the
Doctor
began
to
read
out
scraps
of
the
famous
Dictionary
,
in
these
walks
,
I
never
knew
;
perhaps
he
felt
it
<EOS>
all
the
same
,
at
first
,
as
reading
to
himself
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
passed
into
a
custom
too
;
and
Mr
Dick
,
listening
with
a
face
shining
with
pride
and
pleasure
,
in
his
heart
of
hearts
believed
the
Dictionary
to
be
the
most
delightful
book
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
As
I
think
of
them
going
up
and
down
before
those
schoolroom
windows
---
the
Doctor
reading
with
his
complacent
smile
,
an
occasional
flourish
of
the
manuscript
,
or
grave
motion
of
his
head
;
and
Mr
Dick
listening
,
enchained
by
interest
,
with
his
poor
wits
calmly
wandering
<EOS>
God
knows
where
,
upon
the
wings
of
hard
words
---
I
think
of
it
as
one
of
the
pleasantest
things
,
in
a
quiet
way
,
that
I
have
ever
seen
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
they
might
go
walking
to
and
fro
for
ever
,
and
the
world
might
somehow
be
the
better
for
it
---
as
if
a
thousand
things
it
makes
a
noise
about
,
were
not
one
half
so
good
for
it
,
or
me
.
   
<EOS>
Agnes
was
one
of
Mr
Dick
's
friends
,
very
soon
;
and
in
often
coming
to
the
house
,
he
made
acquaintance
with
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
The
friendship
between
himself
and
me
increased
continually
,
and
it
was
maintained
on
this
odd
footing
:
<EOS>
that
,
while
Mr
Dick
came
professedly
to
look
after
me
as
my
guardian
,
he
always
consulted
me
in
any
little
matter
of
doubt
that
arose
,
and
invariably
guided
himself
by
my
advice
;
not
only
having
a
high
respect
for
my
native
sagacity
,
but
considering
that
I
inherited
a
good
deal
from
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
One
Thursday
morning
,
when
I
was
about
to
walk
with
Mr
Dick
from
the
hotel
to
the
coach
office
before
going
back
to
school
(
for
we
had
an
hour
's
school
before
breakfast
)
,
I
met
Uriah
in
the
street
,
who
reminded
me
of
the
promise
I
had
made
to
take
tea
with
himself
and
his
mother
:
adding
,
with
a
writhe
,
"
<EOS>
But
I
did
n't
expect
you
to
keep
it
,
Master
Copperfield
,
we
're
so
very
umble
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
really
had
not
yet
been
able
to
make
up
my
mind
whether
I
liked
Uriah
or
detested
him
;
and
I
was
very
doubtful
about
it
still
,
as
I
stood
looking
him
in
the
face
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
felt
it
quite
an
affront
to
be
supposed
proud
,
and
said
I
only
wanted
to
be
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
that
's
all
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
said
Uriah
,
"
and
it
really
is
n't
our
umbleness
that
prevents
you
<EOS>
,
will
you
come
this
evening
?
 
<EOS>
But
if
it
is
our
umbleness
,
I
hope
you
wo
n't
mind
owning
to
it
,
Master
Copperfield
;
for
we
are
well
aware
of
our
condition
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
said
I
would
mention
it
to
Mr
Wickfield
,
and
if
he
approved
,
as
I
had
no
doubt
he
would
,
I
would
come
with
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
at
six
o'clock
that
evening
,
which
was
one
of
the
early
office
evenings
,
I
announced
myself
as
ready
,
to
Uriah
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mother
will
be
proud
,
indeed
,
"
he
said
,
as
we
walked
away
together
.
 
<EOS>
"
Or
she
would
be
proud
,
if
it
was
n't
sinful
,
Master
Copperfield
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yet
you
did
n't
mind
supposing
<EOS>
I
was
proud
this
morning
,
"
I
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
,
no
,
Master
Copperfield
!
"
returned
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
believe
me
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
Such
a
thought
never
came
into
my
head
!
 
<EOS>
I
should
n't
have
deemed
it
at
all
proud
if
you
had
thought
US
too
umble
for
you
.
<EOS>
Because
we
are
so
very
umble
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
been
studying
much
law
lately
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
to
change
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
he
said
,
with
an
air
of
self
-
denial
,
"
my
reading
is
hardly
to
be
called
study
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
passed
an
hour
or
two
in
the
evening
,
sometimes
,
with
Mr
Tidd
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Rather
hard
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
I.
<EOS>
"
He
is
hard
to
me
sometimes
,
"
returned
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
know
what
he
might
be
to
a
gifted
person
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
beating
a
little
tune
on
his
chin
as
he
walked
on
,
with
the
two
forefingers
of
his
skeleton
right
hand
,
he
added
:
   
"
There
are
expressions
,
you
see
,
Master
Copperfield
---
Latin
words
and
terms
---
in
Mr
Tidd
,
that
are
trying
to
a
reader
of
my
umble
attainments
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
like
to
be
taught
Latin
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
briskly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
teach
it
you
with
pleasure
,
as
I
learn
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
thank
you
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
he
answered
,
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
it
's
very
kind
of
you
to
make
the
offer
,
but
I
am
much
too
umble
to
accept
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
nonsense
,
Uriah
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
indeed
you
must
excuse
me
,
Master
Copperfield
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
greatly
obliged
,
and
I
should
like
it
of
all
things
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
;
but
I
am
far
too
umble
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
people
enough
to
tread
upon
me
in
my
lowly
state
,
without
my
doing
outrage
to
their
feelings
by
possessing
learning
.
 
<EOS>
Learning
ai
n't
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
A
person
like
myself
had
better
not
aspire
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
is
to
get
on
in
life
,
he
must
get
on
umbly
,
Master
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
never
saw
his
mouth
so
wide
,
or
the
creases
in
his
cheeks
<EOS>
so
deep
,
as
when
he
delivered
himself
of
these
sentiments
:
shaking
his
head
all
the
time
,
and
writhing
modestly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
are
wrong
,
Uriah
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
there
are
several
things
that
I
could
teach
you
,
if
you
would
like
to
learn
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
do
n't
doubt
that
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
he
answered
;
"
not
in
the
least
.
 
<EOS>
But
not
being
umble
yourself
,
you
do
n't
judge
well
,
perhaps
,
for
them
that
are
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
provoke
my
betters
with
knowledge
,
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
much
too
umble
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
my
umble
dwelling
,
Master
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
entered
a
low
,
old
-
fashioned
room
,
walked
straight
into
from
the
street
,
and
found
there
<EOS>
Mrs
Heep
,
who
was
the
dead
image
of
Uriah
,
only
short
.
 
<EOS>
She
received
me
with
the
utmost
humility
,
and
apologized
to
me
for
giving
her
son
a
kiss
,
observing
that
,
lowly
as
they
were
,
they
had
their
natural
affections
,
which
they
hoped
would
give
no
offence
to
anyone
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
perfectly
decent
room
,
half
parlour
and
half
kitchen
,
but
not
at
all
a
snug
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
tea
-
things
were
set
upon
the
table
,
and
the
kettle
was
boiling
on
the
hob
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
chest
of
drawers
with
an
escritoire
top
,
for
Uriah
to
read
or
write
at
of
an
evening
;
there
was
Uriah
's
blue
bag
lying
down
and
vomiting
papers
;
there
was
a
company
of
Uriah
's
books
commanded
by
Mr
Tidd
;
there
was
a
corner
cupboard
:
and
there
were
the
usual
articles
of
furniture
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
remember
that
any
individual
object
had
a
bare
,
pinched
,
spare
look
;
but
I
do
remember
that
the
whole
place
had
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
perhaps
a
part
of
Mrs
Heep
's
humility
,
that
she
still
wore
weeds
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
lapse
of
time
that
had
occurred
since
Mr
Heep
's
decease
,
she
still
wore
weeds
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
there
was
some
compromise
in
the
cap
;
but
otherwise
she
was
as
weedy
as
in
the
early
days
of
her
mourning
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
day
to
be
remembered
,
my
Uriah
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Mrs
Heep
,
making
the
tea
,
"
when
Master
Copperfield
pays
us
a
visit
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
said
you
'd
think
so
,
mother
,
"
said
Uriah
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
could
have
wished
father
to
remain
among
us
for
any
reason
,
"
said
Mrs
Heep
,
"
it
would
have
been
,
that
he
might
have
known
his
company
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
felt
embarrassed
by
these
compliments
;
but
I
was
sensible
,
too
,
of
being
entertained
as
an
honoured
guest
,
and
I
thought
Mrs
Heep
an
agreeable
woman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
Uriah
,
"
said
Mrs
Heep
,
"
has
looked
forward
to
this
,
sir
,
a
long
while
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
his
fears
that
our
umbleness
stood
in
the
way
,
and
I
joined
in
them
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Umble
we
are
,
<EOS>
umble
we
have
been
,
umble
we
shall
ever
be
,
"
said
Mrs
Heep
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
have
no
occasion
to
be
so
<EOS>
,
ma'am
,
"
I
said
,
"
unless
you
like
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
"
retorted
Mrs
Heep
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
know
our
station
and
are
thankful
in
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
found
that
Mrs
Heep
gradually
got
nearer
to
me
,
and
that
Uriah
gradually
got
opposite
to
me
,
and
that
they
respectfully
plied
me
with
the
choicest
of
the
eatables
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
particularly
choice
there
,
to
be
sure
;
but
I
took
the
will
for
the
deed
,
and
felt
that
they
were
very
attentive
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
they
began
to
talk
about
aunts
,
and
then
I
told
them
about
mine
;
and
about
fathers
and
mothers
,
and
then
I
told
them
about
mine
;
and
then
Mrs
Heep
began
to
talk
about
fathers
-
in
-
law
,
and
then
I
began
to
tell
her
about
mine
---
but
stopped
,
because
my
aunt
had
advised
me
to
observe
a
silence
on
that
subject
.
 
<EOS>
A
tender
young
cork
,
however
,
would
have
had
no
more
chance
against
a
pair
of
corkscrews
,
or
a
tender
young
tooth
against
a
pair
of
dentists
,
or
a
little
shuttlecock
against
two
battledores
,
than
I
had
against
Uriah
and
Mrs
Heep
.
 
<EOS>
They
did
just
what
they
liked
with
me
;
and
wormed
things
out
of
me
that
I
had
no
desire
to
tell
,
with
a
certainty
I
blush
to
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
especially
,
as
in
my
juvenile
frankness
,
I
took
some
credit
to
myself
for
being
so
confidential
and
felt
that
I
was
quite
the
patron
of
my
two
respectful
entertainers
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
very
fond
of
one
another
:
that
was
certain
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
it
,
that
had
its
effect
upon
me
,
as
a
touch
of
nature
;
but
the
skill
with
which
the
one
followed
up
whatever
the
other
said
,
was
a
touch
of
art
which
I
was
still
less
proof
against
.
 
<EOS>
When
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
got
out
of
me
about
myself
(
for
on
the
Murdstone
and
Grinby
life
,
and
on
my
journey
,
I
was
dumb
)
,
they
began
about
Mr
Wickfield
and
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
Uriah
threw
the
ball
to
Mrs
Heep
<EOS>
,
Mrs
Heep
caught
it
and
threw
it
back
to
Uriah
,
Uriah
kept
it
up
a
little
while
,
then
sent
it
back
to
Mrs
Heep
,
and
so
they
went
on
tossing
it
about
until
I
had
no
idea
who
had
got
it
,
and
was
quite
bewildered
.
 
<EOS>
The
ball
itself
was
always
changing
too
.
 
<EOS>
Now
it
was
Mr
Wickfield
,
now
Agnes
,
now
the
excellence
of
Mr
Wickfield
,
now
my
admiration
of
Agnes
;
now
the
extent
of
Mr
Wickfield
's
business
and
resources
,
now
our
domestic
life
after
dinner
;
now
,
the
wine
that
Mr
Wickfield
took
,
the
reason
why
he
took
it
,
and
the
pity
that
it
was
he
took
so
much
;
now
one
thing
,
now
another
,
<EOS>
then
everything
at
once
;
and
all
the
time
,
without
appearing
to
speak
very
often
,
or
to
do
anything
but
sometimes
encourage
them
a
little
,
for
fear
they
should
be
overcome
by
their
humility
and
the
honour
of
my
company
,
I
found
myself
perpetually
letting
out
something
or
other
that
I
had
no
business
to
let
out
and
seeing
the
effect
of
it
in
the
twinkling
of
Uriah
's
dinted
nostrils
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
begun
to
be
a
little
uncomfortable
,
and
to
wish
myself
well
out
of
the
visit
,
when
a
figure
coming
down
the
street
passed
the
door
---
it
stood
open
to
air
the
room
,
which
was
warm
,
the
weather
being
close
for
the
time
of
year
---
came
back
again
,
looked
in
,
and
walked
in
,
exclaiming
loudly
,
"
Copperfield
!
 
<EOS>
Is
it
possible
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
Mr
Micawber
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
Mr
Micawber
,
with
his
eye
-
glass
,
and
his
walking
-
stick
,
and
his
shirt
-
collar
,
and
his
genteel
air
,
and
the
condescending
roll
in
his
voice
,
all
complete
!
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
putting
out
his
hand
,
"
this
is
indeed
a
meeting
which
is
calculated
to
impress
the
mind
with
a
sense
of
the
instability
and
uncertainty
of
all
human
---
in
short
,
it
is
a
most
extraordinary
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
Walking
along
the
street
,
reflecting
upon
the
probability
of
something
turning
up
(
of
which
I
am
at
present
rather
sanguine
)
<EOS>
,
I
find
a
young
but
valued
friend
turn
up
,
who
is
connected
with
the
most
eventful
period
of
my
life
;
I
may
say
,
with
the
turning
-
point
of
my
existence
.
<EOS>
Copperfield
,
my
dear
fellow
,
how
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
---
<EOS>
I
really
can
not
say
---
that
I
was
glad
to
see
Mr
Micawber
there
;
but
I
was
glad
to
see
him
too
,
and
shook
hands
with
him
,
heartily
,
inquiring
how
Mrs
Micawber
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
waving
his
hand
as
of
old
,
and
settling
his
chin
in
his
shirt

said
Mr
Micawber
,
in
one
of
his
bursts
of
confidence
,
"
they
are
weaned

Mrs
Micawber
is
,
at

my
travelling
companion

<EOS>
She
will
be
rejoiced
,
Copperfield
,
to
renew
her
acquaintance
with
one
who
has
proved
himself
in
all
respects
a
worthy
minister
at
the
sacred
altar
of
friendship

"
   
<EOS>
I
said
I
should
be
delighted
to
see
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
then
smiled
,
settled
his
chin
again
,
and
looked
about
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
discovered
my
friend
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
genteelly
,
and
without
addressing
himself
particularly
to
anyone
,
"
not
in
solitude
,
but
partaking
of
a
social
meal
in
company
with
a
widow
lady
,
and
one
who
is
apparently
her
offspring
---
in
short

"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
in
another
of
his
bursts
of
confidence
,
"
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
esteem
it
an
honour
to
be
presented
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
do
no
less
,
under
these
circumstances
,
than
make
Mr
Micawber
known
to
Uriah
Heep
and
his
mother
;
which
I
accordingly
did
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
abased
themselves
before
him
,
Mr
Micawber
took
a
seat
,
and
waved
his
hand
in
his
most
courtly
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Any
friend
of
my
friend
Copperfield

,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
has
a
personal
claim
upon
myself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
too
umble
,
sir

"
said
Mrs
Heep
,
"
my
son

me
,
to
be
the
friends
of
Master

<EOS>
He
has
been
so
good
as
take
his
tea
with
us

we
are
thankful
to
him
for
his
company

also
to
you
,
sir

for
your
notice

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ma'am
,
"
returned
Mr
Micawber
,
with
a
bow
,
"
you
are
very
obliging
:
and
what
are
you
doing
,
Copperfield
?
 
<EOS>
Still
in
the
wine
trade
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
excessively
anxious
to
get
Mr
Micawber
away
;
and
replied
,
with
my
hat
in
my
hand
,
and
a
very
red
face
,
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
,
that
I
was
a
pupil
at
Doctor
Strong
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
pupil
?
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
raising
his
eyebrows
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
extremely
happy
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
Although
a
mind
like
my
friend
Copperfield
's
"
---
to
Uriah
and
Mrs
Heep
---
"
does
not
require
that
cultivation
which
,
without
his
knowledge
of
men
and
things
,
it
would
require
,
still
it
is
a
rich
soil
teeming
with
latent
vegetation
---
in
short
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
smiling
,
in
another
burst
of
confidence
,
"
it
is
an
intellect
capable
of
getting
up
the
classics
to
any
extent
.
"
   
<EOS>
Uriah
,
with
his
long
hands
slowly
twining
over
one
another
,
made
a
ghastly
writhe
from
the
waist
upwards
,
to
express
his
concurrence
in
this
estimation
of
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
go
and
see
Mrs
Micawber
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
to
get
Mr
Micawber
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
do
her
that
favour
,
Copperfield
,
"
replied
Mr
Micawber
,
rising
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
scruple
in
saying
,
in
the
presence
of
our
friends
here
,
that
I
am
a
man
who
has
,
for
some
years
,
contended
against
the
pressure
of
pecuniary
difficulties
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
knew
he
was
certain
to
say
something
of
this
kind
;
he
always
would
be
so
boastful
about
his
difficulties
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sometimes
I
have
risen
superior
to
my
difficulties
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
my
difficulties
have
---
in
short
,
have
floored
me
.
 
<EOS>
There
have
been
times
when
I
have
administered
a
succession
of
facers
to
them
;
there
have
been
times
when
they
have
been
too
many
for
me
,
and
I
have
given
in
,
and
said
to
Mrs
Micawber
,
in
the
words
of
Cato
,
"
Plato
,
thou
reasonest
well
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
up
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
show
fight
no
more
.
"
<EOS>
But
at
no
time
of
my
life
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
have
I
enjoyed
a
higher
degree
of
satisfaction
than
in
pouring
my
griefs
<EOS>
(
if
I
may
describe
difficulties
,
chiefly
arising
out
of
warrants
of
attorney
and
promissory
notes
at
two
and
four
months
,
by
that
word
)
into
the
bosom
of
my
friend
Copperfield
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
closed
this
handsome
tribute
by
saying
,
"
Mr
Heep
!
<EOS>
Good
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Heep
!
 
<EOS>
Your
servant
,
"
and
then
walking
out
with
me
in
his
most
fashionable
manner
,
making
a
good
deal
of
noise
on
the
pavement
with
his
shoes
,
and
humming
a
tune
as
we
went
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
inn
where
Mr
Micawber
put
up
,
and
he
occupied
a
little
room
in
it
,
partitioned
off
from
the
commercial
room
,
and
strongly
flavoured
with
tobacco
-
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
was
over
the
kitchen
,
because
a
warm
greasy
smell
appeared
to
come
up
through
the
chinks
in
the
floor
,
and
there
was
a
flabby
perspiration
on
the
walls
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
was
near
the
bar
,
on
account
of
the
smell
of
spirits
and
jingling
of
glasses
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
recumbent
on
a
small
sofa
,
underneath
a
picture
of
a
race
-
horse
,
with
her
head
close
to
the
fire
,
and
her
feet
pushing
the
mustard
off
the
dumb
-
waiter
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
was
Mrs
Micawber
,
to
whom
Mr
Micawber
entered
first
,
saying
,
"
My
dear
,
allow
me
to
introduce
to
you
a
pupil
of
Doctor
Strong
's
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
noticed
,
by
the
by
,
that
although
Mr
Micawber
was
just
as
much
confused
as
ever
about
my
age
and
standing
,
he
always
remembered
,
as
a
genteel
thing
,
that
I
was
a
pupil
of
Doctor
Strong
's
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
was
amazed
,
but
very
glad
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
very
glad
to
see
her
too
,
and
,
after
an
affectionate
greeting
on
both
sides
,
sat
down
on
the
small
sofa
near
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
if
you
will
mention
to
Copperfield
what
our
present
position
is
,
which
I
have
no
doubt
he
will
like
to
know
,
I
will
go
and
look
at
the
paper
the
while
,
and
see
whether
anything
turns
up
among
the
advertisements
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
were
at
Plymouth
,
ma'am
,
"
I
said
to
Mrs
Micawber
,
as
he
went
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Master
Copperfield
,
"
she
replied
,
"
we
went
to
Plymouth
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
To
be
on
the
spot
,
"
I
hinted
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
so
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
on
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
truth
is
,
talent
is
not
wanted
in
the
Custom
House
.
 
<EOS>
The
local
influence
of
my
family
was
quite
unavailing
to
obtain
any
employment
in
that
department
,
for
a
man
of
Mr
Micawber
's
abilities
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
rather
NOT
have
a
man
of
Mr
Micawber
's
abilities
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
only
show
the
deficiency
of
the
others
.
 
<EOS>
Apart
from
which
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
I
will
not
disguise
from
you
,
my
dear
Master
Copperfield
,
that
when
that
branch
of
my
family
which
is
settled
in
Plymouth
,
became
aware
that
Mr
Micawber
was
accompanied
by
myself
,
and
by
little
Wilkins
and
his
sister
,
and
by
the
twins
,
they
did
not
receive
him
with
that
ardour
which
he
might
have
expected
,
being
so
newly
released
from
captivity
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
lowering
her
voice
,
<EOS>
---
"
this
is
between
ourselves
---
our
reception
was
cool
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
truly
painful
to
contemplate
mankind
in
such
an
aspect
,
Master
Copperfield
,
but
our
reception
was
,
decidedly
,
cool
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
doubt
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
that
branch
of
my
family
which
is
settled
in
Plymouth
became
quite
personal
to
Mr
Micawber
,
before
we
had
been
there
a
week
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
said
,
and
thought
,
that
they
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
themselves
.
   
<EOS>
"
Still
,
so
it
was
,
"
continued
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
Under
such
circumstances
,
what
could
a
man
of
Mr
Micawber
's
spirit
do
?
 
<EOS>
But
one
obvious
course
was
left
.
 
<EOS>
To
borrow
,
of
that
branch
of
my
family
,
the
money
to
return
to
London
,
and
to
return
at
any
sacrifice
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
all
came
back
again
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
all
came
back
again
,
"
replied
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
Since
then
,
I
have
consulted
other
branches
of
my
family
on
the
course
which
it
is
most
expedient
for
Mr
Micawber
to
take
---
for
I
maintain
that
he
must
take
some
course
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
argumentatively
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
clear
that
a
family
of
six
,
not
including
a
domestic
,
can
not
live
upon
air
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
ma'am
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
The
opinion
of
those
other
branches
of
my
family
,
"
pursued
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
is
,
that
Mr
Micawber
should
immediately
turn
his
attention
to
coals
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
what
,
ma'am
?
"
   
"
To
coals
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
the
coal
trade
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
was
induced
to
think
,
on
inquiry
,
that
there
might
be
an
opening
for
a
man
of
his
talent
in
the
Medway
Coal
Trade
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
as
Mr
Micawber
very
properly
said
,
the
first
step
to
be
taken
clearly
was
,
to
come
and
see
the
Medway
.
 
<EOS>
Which
we
came
and
saw
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
"
we
"
,
Master
Copperfield
;
for
I
never
will
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
with
emotion
,
"
I
never
will
desert
Mr
Micawber
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
murmured
my
admiration
and
approbation
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
came
,
"
repeated
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
and
saw
the
Medway
.
 
<EOS>
My
opinion
of
the
coal
trade
on
that
river
is
,
that
it
may
require
talent
,
but
that
it
certainly
requires
capital
.
 
<EOS>
Talent
,
Mr
Micawber
has
;
capital
,
Mr
Micawber
has
not
.
 
<EOS>
We
saw
,
I
think
,
the
greater
part
of
the
Medway
;
and
that
is
my
individual
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
Being
so
near
here
,
Mr
Micawber
was
of
opinion
that
it
would
be
rash
not
to
come
on
,
and
see
the
Cathedral
.
 
<EOS>
Firstly
,
on
account
of
its
being
so
well
worth
seeing
,
and
our
never
having
seen
it
;
and
secondly
,
on
account
of
the
great
probability
of
something
turning
up
in
a
cathedral
town
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
been
here
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
three
days
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
has
,
as
yet
,
turned
up
;
and
it
may
not
surprise
you
,
my
dear
Master
Copperfield
,
so
much
as
it
would
a
stranger
,
to
know
that
we
are
at
present
waiting
for
a
remittance
from
London
,
to
discharge
our
pecuniary
obligations
at
this
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
Until
the
arrival
of
that
remittance
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
with
much
feeling
,
"
I
am
cut
off
from
my
home
<EOS>
(
I
allude
to
lodgings
in
Pentonville
)
,
from
my
boy
and
girl
,
and
from
my
twins
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
felt
the
utmost
sympathy
for
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
in
this
anxious
extremity
,
and
said
as
much
to
Mr
Micawber
,
who
now
returned
:
adding
that
I
only
wished
I
had
money
enough
,
to
lend
them
the
amount
they
needed
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
's
answer
expressed
the
disturbance
of
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
shaking
hands
with
me
,
"
Copperfield
,
you
are
a
true
friend
;
but
when
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
,
no
man
is
without
a
friend
who
is
possessed
of
shaving
materials
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
dreadful
hint
Mrs
Micawber
threw
her
arms
round
Mr
Micawber
's
neck
and
entreated
him
to
be
calm
.
 
<EOS>
He
wept
;
but
so
far
recovered
,
almost
immediately
,
as
to
ring
the
bell
for
the
waiter
,
and
bespeak
a
hot
kidney
pudding
and
a
plate
of
shrimps
for
breakfast
in
the
morning
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
took
my
leave
of
them
,
they
both
pressed
me
so
much
to
come
and
dine
before
they
went
away
,
that
I
could
not
refuse
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
knew
I
could
not
come
next
day
,
when
I
should
have
a
good
deal
to
prepare
in
the
evening
,
Mr
Micawber
arranged
that
he
would
call
at
Doctor
Strong
's
in
the
course
of
the
morning
(
having
a
presentiment
that
the
remittance
would
arrive
by
that
post
)
,
and
propose
the
day
after
,
if
it
would
suit
me
better
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
I
was
called
out
of
school
next
forenoon
,
and
found
Mr
Micawber
in
the
parlour
;
who
had
called
to
say
that
the
dinner
would
take
place
as
proposed
.
<EOS>
When
I
asked
him
if
the
remittance
had
come
,
he
pressed
my
hand
and
departed
.
   
<EOS>
As
I
was
looking
out
of
window
that
same
evening
,
it
surprised
me
,
and
made
me
rather
uneasy
,
to
see
Mr
Micawber
and
Uriah
Heep
walk
past
,
arm
in
arm
:
<EOS>
Uriah
humbly
sensible
of
the
honour
that
was
done
him
,
and
Mr
Micawber
taking
a
bland
delight
in
extending
his
patronage
to
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
still
more
surprised
,
when
I
went
to
the
little
hotel
next
day
at
the
appointed
dinner
-
hour
,
which
was
four
o'clock
,
to
find
,
from
what
Mr
Micawber
said
,
that
he
had
gone
home
with
Uriah
,
and
had
drunk
brandy
-
and
-
water
at
Mrs
Heep
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
'll
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
<EOS>
your
friend
Heep
is
a
young
fellow
who
might
be
attorney
-
general
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
known
that
young
man
,
at
the
period
when
my
difficulties
came
to
a
crisis
,
all
I
can
say
is
,
that
I
believe
my
creditors
would
have
been
a
great
deal
better
managed
than
they
were
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
hardly
understood
how
this
could
have
been
,
seeing
that
Mr
Micawber
had
paid
them
nothing
at
all
as
it
was
;
but
I
did
not
like
to
ask
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
did
I
like
to
say
,
that
I
hoped
he
had
not
been
too
communicative
to
Uriah
;
or
to
inquire
if
they
had
talked
much
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
of
hurting
Mr
Micawber
's
feelings
,
or
,
at
all
events
,
Mrs
Micawber
's
,
she
being
very
sensitive
;
but
I
was
uncomfortable
about
it
,
too
,
and
often
thought
about
it
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
a
beautiful
little
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
an
elegant
dish
of
fish
;
the
kidney
-
end
of
a
loin
of
veal
,
roasted
;
fried
sausage
-
meat
;
a
partridge
,
and
a
pudding
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
wine
,
and
there
was
strong
ale
;
and
after
dinner
Mrs
Micawber
made
us
a
bowl
of
hot
punch
with
her
own
hands
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
was
uncommonly
convivial
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
him
such
good
company
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
his
face
shine
with
the
punch
,
so
that
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
varnished
all
over
.
 
<EOS>
He
got
cheerfully
sentimental
about
the
town
,
and
proposed
success
to
it
;
observing
that
Mrs
Micawber
and
himself
had
been
made
extremely
snug
and
comfortable
there
and
that
he
never
should
forget
the
agreeable
hours
they
had
passed
in
Canterbury
.
 
<EOS>
He
proposed
me
afterwards
;
and
he
,
and
Mrs
Micawber
,
and
I
,
took
a
review
of
our
past
acquaintance
,
in
the
course
of
which
we
sold
the
property
all
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
proposed
Mrs
Micawber
:
or
,
at
least
,
said
,
modestly
,
"
If
you
'll
allow
me
,
Mrs
Micawber
,
I
shall
now
have
the
pleasure
of
drinking
your
health
,
ma'am
.
"
 
<EOS>
On
which
Mr
Micawber
delivered
an
eulogium
on
Mrs
Micawber
's
character
,
and
said
she
had
ever
been
his
guide
,
philosopher
,
and
friend
,
and
that
he
would
recommend
me
,
when
I
came
to
a
marrying
time
of
life
,
to
marry
such
another
woman
,
if
such
another
woman
could
be
found
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
punch
disappeared
,
Mr
Micawber
became
still
more
friendly
and
convivial
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
's
spirits
becoming
elevated
,
too
,
we
sang
"
Auld
Lang
Syne
"
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
came
to
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
hand
,
my
trusty
frere
"
,
we
all
joined
hands
round
the
table
;
and
when
we
declared
we
would
"
take
a
right
gude
Willie
Waught
"
,
and
had
n't
the
least
idea
<EOS>
what
it
meant
,
we
were
really
affected
.
   
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
I
never
saw
anybody
so
thoroughly
jovial
as
Mr
Micawber
was
,
down
to
the
very
last
moment
of
the
evening
,
when
I
took
a
hearty
farewell
of
himself
and
his
amiable
wife
.
 
<EOS>
Consequently
,
I
was
not
prepared
,
at
seven
o'clock
next
morning
,
to
receive
the
following
communication
,
dated
half
past
nine
in
the
evening
;
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
I
had
left
him
:
---
   
<EOS>
"
My
DEAR
YOUNG
FRIEND
,
"
   
"
The
die
is
cast
---
all
is
over
.
 
<EOS>
Hiding
the
ravages
of
care
with
a
sickly
mask
of
mirth
,
I
have
not
informed
you
,
this
evening
,
that
there
is
no
hope
of
the
remittance
!
 
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
,
alike
humiliating
to
endure
,
humiliating
to
contemplate
,
and
humiliating
to
relate
,
I
have
discharged
the
pecuniary
liability
contracted
at
this
establishment
,
by
giving
a
note
of
hand
,
made
payable
fourteen
days
after
date
,
at
my
residence
,
Pentonville
,
London
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
becomes
due
,
it
will
not
be
taken
up
.
 
<EOS>
The
result
is
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
The
bolt
is
impending
,
and
the
tree
must
fall
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
the
wretched
man
who
now
addresses
you
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
be
a
beacon
to
you
through
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
writes
with
that
intention
,
and
in
that
hope
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
could
think
himself
of
so
much
use
,
one
gleam
of
day
might
,
by
possibility
,
penetrate
into
the
cheerless
dungeon
of
his
remaining
existence
---
though
his
longevity
is
,
at
present
(
to
say
the
least
of
it
)
,
extremely
problematical
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
last
communication
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
you
will
ever
receive
"
   
"
From
"
   
"
The
"
   
"
Beggared
Outcast

"
   
"
WILKINS
MICAWBER
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
so
shocked
by
the
contents
of
this
heart
-
rending
letter
,
that
I
ran
off
directly
towards
the
little
hotel
with
the
intention
of
taking
it
on
my
way
to
Doctor
Strong
's
,
and
trying
to
soothe
Mr
Micawber
with
a
word
of
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
half
-
way
there
,
I
met
the
London
coach
with
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
up
behind
;
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
the
very
picture
of
tranquil
enjoyment
,
smiling
at
Mrs
Micawber
's
conversation
,
eating
walnuts
out
of
a
paper
bag
,
with
a
bottle
sticking
out
of
his
breast
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
did
not
see
me
,
I
thought
it
best
,
all
things
considered
,
not
to
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
with
a
great
weight
taken
off
my
mind
<EOS>
,
I
turned
into
a
by
-
street
that
was
the
nearest
way
to
school
,
and
felt
,
upon
the
whole
,
relieved
that
they
were
gone
;
though
I
still
liked
them
very
much
,
nevertheless
.

Chapter
18
.
<EOS>
A
retrospect
 
<EOS>
My
school
-
days
!
 
<EOS>
The
silent
gliding
on
of
my
existence
---
the
unseen
,
unfelt
progress
of
my
life
---
from
childhood
up
to
youth
!
<EOS>
Let
me
think
,
as
I
look
back
upon
that
flowing
water
,
now
a
dry
channel
overgrown
with
leaves
,
whether
there
are
any
marks
along
its
course
,
by
which
I
can
remember
how
it
ran
.
   
<EOS>
A
moment
,
and
I
occupy
my
place
in
the
Cathedral
,
where
we
all
went
together
,
every
Sunday
morning
,
assembling
first
at
school
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
The
earthy
smell
,
the
sunless
air
,
the
sensation
of
the
world
being
shut
out
,
the
resounding
of
the
organ
through
the
black
and
white
arched
galleries
and
aisles
,
are
wings
that
take
me
back
,
and
hold
me
hovering
above
those
days
,
in
a
half
-
sleeping
and
half
-
waking
dream
.
   
<EOS>
I
am
not
the
last
boy
in
the
school
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
risen
in
a
few
months
,
over
several
heads
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
first
boy
seems
to
me
a
mighty
creature
,
dwelling
afar
off
,
whose
giddy
height
is
unattainable
.
<EOS>
Agnes
says
"
No
,
"
but
I
say
"
Yes
,
"
and
tell
her
that
she
little
thinks
what
stores
of
knowledge
have
been
mastered
by
the
wonderful
Being
,
at
whose
place
she
thinks
I
,
even
I
,
weak
aspirant
,
may
arrive
in
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
my
private
friend
and
public
patron
,
as
Steerforth
was
,
but
I
hold
him
in
a
reverential
respect
.
 
<EOS>
I
chiefly
wonder
what
he
'll
be
,
when
he
leaves
Doctor
Strong
's
,
and
what
mankind
will
do
to
maintain
any
place
against
him
.
   
<EOS>
But
who
is
this
that
breaks
upon
me
?
 
<EOS>
This
is
Miss
Shepherd
,
whom
I
love
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Shepherd
is
a
boarder
at
the
Misses
Nettingalls
'
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
I
adore
Miss
Shepherd
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
a
little
girl
,
in
a
spencer
,
with
a
round
face
and
curly
flaxen
hair
.
 
<EOS>
The
Misses
Nettingalls
'
young
ladies
come
to
the
Cathedral
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
look
upon
my
book
,
<EOS>
for
I
must
look
upon
Miss
Shepherd
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
choristers
chaunt
,
I
hear
Miss
Shepherd
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
service
I
mentally
insert
Miss
Shepherd
's
name
---
I
put
her
in
among
the
Royal
Family
.
<EOS>
At
home
,
in
my
own
room
,
I
am
sometimes
moved
to
cry
out
,
"
Oh
,
Miss
Shepherd
!
"
<EOS>
in
a
transport
of
love
.
   
<EOS>
For
some
time
,
I
am
doubtful
of
Miss
Shepherd
's
feelings
,
but
,
at
length
,
Fate
being
propitious
,
we
meet
at
the
dancing
-
school
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
Miss
Shepherd
for
my
partner
.
 
<EOS>
I
touch
Miss
Shepherd
's
glove
,
and
feel
a
thrill
go
up
the
right
arm
of
my
jacket
,
and
come
out
at
my
hair
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
to
Miss
Shepherd
,
but
we
understand
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Shepherd
and
myself
live
but
to
be
united
.
   
<EOS>
Why
do
I
secretly
give
Miss
Shepherd
twelve
Brazil
nuts
for
a
present
,
I
wonder
?
 
<EOS>
They
are
not
expressive
of
affection
,
they
are
difficult
to
pack
into
a
parcel
of
any
regular
shape
,
they
are
hard
to
crack
,
even
in
room
doors
,
and
they
are
oily
when
cracked
;
yet
I
feel
that
they
are
appropriate
to
Miss
Shepherd
.
 
<EOS>
Soft
,
seedy
biscuits
,
also
,
I
bestow
upon
Miss
Shepherd
;
and
oranges
innumerable
.
 
<EOS>
Once
,
I
kiss
Miss
Shepherd
in
the
cloak
-
room
.
<EOS>
Ecstasy
!
 
<EOS>
What
are
my
agony
and
indignation
next
day
,
when
I
hear
a
flying
rumour
that
the
Misses
Nettingall
have
stood
Miss
Shepherd
in
the
stocks
for
turning
in
her
toes
!
   
<EOS>
Miss
Shepherd
being
the
one
pervading
theme
and
vision
of
my
life
,
how
do
I
ever
come
to
break
with
her
?
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
conceive
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
a
coolness
grows
between
Miss
Shepherd
and
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Whispers
reach
me
of
Miss
Shepherd
having
said
she
wished
I
would
n't
stare
so
,
and
having
avowed
a
preference
for
Master
Jones
---
for
Jones
!
<EOS>
a
boy
of
no
merit
whatever
!
 
<EOS>
The
gulf
between
me
and
Miss
Shepherd
widens
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
one
day
,
I
meet
the
Misses
Nettingalls
'
establishment
out
walking
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Shepherd
makes
a
face
as
she
goes
by
,
and
laughs
to
her
companion
.
 
<EOS>
All
is
over
.
 
<EOS>
The
devotion
of
a
life
---
it
seems
a
life
<EOS>
,
it
is
all
the
same
---
is
at
an
end
;
Miss
Shepherd
comes
out
of
the
morning
service
,
and
the
Royal
Family
know
her
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
I
am
higher
in
the
school
,
and
no
one
breaks
my
peace
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
at
all
polite
,
now
,
to
the
Misses
Nettingalls
'
young
ladies
,
and
should
n't
dote
on
any
of
them
,
if
they
were
twice
as
many
and
twenty
times
as
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
dancing
-
school
a
tiresome
affair
,
and
wonder
why
the
girls
ca
n't
dance
by
themselves
and
leave
us
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
growing
great
in
Latin
verses
,
and
neglect
the
laces
of
my
boots
.
 
<EOS>
Doctor
Strong
refers
to
me
in
public
as
a
promising
young
scholar
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
is
wild
with
joy
,
and
my
aunt
remits
me
a
guinea
by
the
next
post
.
   
<EOS>
The
shade
of
a
young
butcher
rises
,
like
the
apparition
of
an
armed
head
in
Macbeth
.
 
<EOS>
Who
is
this
young
butcher
?
 
<EOS>
He
is
the
terror
of
the
youth
of
Canterbury
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
vague
belief
abroad
,
that
the
beef
suet
with
which
he
anoints
his
hair
gives
him
unnatural
strength
,
and
that
he
is
a
match
for
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
broad
-
faced
,
bull
-
necked
,
young
butcher
,
with
rough
red
cheeks
,
an
ill
-
conditioned
mind
,
and
an
injurious
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
His
main
use
of
this
tongue
,
is
,
to
disparage
Doctor
Strong
's
young
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
,
publicly
,
that
if
they
want
anything
he
'll
give
it
'em
.
 
<EOS>
He
names
individuals
among
them
(
myself
included
)
,
whom
he
could
undertake
to
settle
with
one
hand
,
and
the
other
tied
behind
him
.
<EOS>
He
waylays
the
smaller
boys
to
punch
their
unprotected
heads
,
and
calls
challenges
after
me
in
the
open
streets
.
 
<EOS>
For
these
sufficient
reasons
I
resolve
to
fight
the
butcher
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
a
summer
evening
,
down
in
a
green
hollow
,
at
the
corner
of
a
wall
.
 
<EOS>
I
meet
the
butcher
by
appointment
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
attended
by
a
select
body
of
our
boys
;
the
butcher
,
by
two
other
butchers
,
a
young
publican
,
and
a
sweep
.
 
<EOS>
The
preliminaries
are
adjusted
,
and
the
butcher
and
myself
stand
face
to
face
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
moment
the
butcher
lights
ten
thousand
candles
out
of
my
left
eyebrow
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
moment
,
I
do
n't
know
where
the
wall
is
,
or
where
I
am
,
or
where
anybody
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
which
is
myself
and
which
the
butcher
,
we
are
always
in
such
a
tangle
and
tussle
,
knocking
about
upon
the
trodden
grass
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
see
the
butcher
,
bloody
but
confident
;
sometimes
I
see
nothing
,
and
sit
gasping
on
my
second
's
knee
;
sometimes
I
go
in
at
the
butcher
madly
,
and
cut
my
knuckles
open
against
his
face
,
without
appearing
to
discompose
him
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
I
awake
,
very
queer
about
the
head
,
as
from
a
giddy
sleep
,
and
see
the
butcher
walking
off
,
congratulated
by
the
two
other
butchers
and
the
sweep
and
publican
,
and
putting
on
his
coat
as
he
goes
;
from
which
I
augur
,
justly
,
that
the
victory
is
his
.
   
<EOS>
I
am
taken
home
in
a
sad
plight
,
and
I
have
beef
-
steaks
put
to
my
eyes
,
and
am
rubbed
with
vinegar
and
brandy
,
and
find
a
great
puffy
place
bursting
out
on
my
upper
lip
,
which
swells
immoderately
.
 
<EOS>
For
three
or
four
days
I
remain
at
home
,
a
very
ill
-
looking
subject
,
with
a
green
shade
over
my
eyes
;
and
I
should
be
very
dull
,
but
that
Agnes
is
a
sister
to
me
,
and
condoles
with
me
,
and
reads
to
me
,
and
makes
the
time
light
and
happy
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
has
my
confidence
completely
,
always
;
I
tell
her
all
about
the
butcher
,
and
the
wrongs
he
has
heaped
upon
me
;
she
thinks
I
could
n't
have
done
otherwise
than
fight
the
butcher
,
while
she
shrinks
and
trembles
at
my
having
fought
him
.
   
<EOS>
Time
has
stolen
on
unobserved
,
for
Adams
is
not
the
head
-
boy
in
the
days
that
are
come
now
,
nor
has
he
been
this
many
and
many
a
day
.
<EOS>
Adams
has
left
the
school
so
long
,
that
when
he
comes
back
,
on
a
visit
to
Doctor
Strong
,
there
are
not
many
there
,
besides
myself
,
who
know
him
.
 
<EOS>
Adams
is
going
to
be
called
to
the
bar
almost
directly
,
and
is
to
be
an
advocate
,
and
to
wear
a
wig
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
surprised
to
find
him
a
meeker
man
than
I
had
thought
,
and
less
imposing
in
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
not
staggered
the
world
yet
,
either
;
for
it
goes
on
(
as
well
as
I
can
make
out
)
pretty
much
the
same
as
if
he
had
never
joined
it
.
   
<EOS>
A
blank
,
through
which
the
warriors
of
poetry
and
history
march
on
in
stately
hosts
that
seem
to
have
no
end
---
and
what
comes
next
!
<EOS>
I
am
the
head
-
boy
,
now
!
 
<EOS>
I
look
down
on
the
line
of
boys
below
me
,
with
a
condescending
interest
in
such
of
them
as
bring
to
my
mind
<EOS>
the
boy
<EOS>
I
was
myself
,
when
I
first
came
there
.
 
<EOS>
That
little
fellow
seems
to
be
no
part
of
me
;
I
remember
him
as
something
left
behind
upon
the
road
of
life
---
as
something
I
have
passed
,
rather
than
have
actually
been
---
and
almost
think
of
him
as
of
someone
else
.
   
<EOS>
And
the
little
girl
I
saw
on
that
first
day
at
Mr
Wickfield
's
,
where
is
she
?
 
<EOS>
Gone
also
.
 
<EOS>
In
her
stead
,
the
perfect
likeness
of
the
picture
,
a
child
likeness
no
more
,
moves
about
the
house
;
and
Agnes
---
my
sweet
sister
,
as
I
call
her
in
my
thoughts
,
my
counsellor
and
friend
,
the
better
angel
of
the
lives
of
all
who
come
within
her
calm
,
good
,
self
-
denying
influence
---
is
quite
a
woman
.
   
<EOS>
What
other
changes
have
come
upon
me
,
besides
the
changes
in
my
growth
and
looks
,
and
in
the
knowledge
I
have
garnered
all
this
while
?
 
<EOS>
I
wear
a
gold
watch
and
chain
,
a
ring
upon
my
little
finger
,
and
a
long
-
tailed
coat
;
and
I
use
a
great
deal
of
bear
's
grease
---
which
,
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
ring
,
looks
bad
.
 
<EOS>
Am
I
in
love
again
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
I
worship
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
.
   
<EOS>
The
eldest
Miss
Larkins
is
not
a
little
girl
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
a
tall
,
dark
,
black
-
eyed
,
fine
figure
of
a
woman
.
 
<EOS>
The
eldest
Miss
Larkins
is
not
a
chicken
;
for
the
youngest
Miss
Larkins
is
not
that
,
and
the
eldest
must
be
three
or
four
years
older
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
may
be
about
thirty
.
 
<EOS>
My
passion
for
her
is
beyond
all
bounds
.
   
<EOS>
The
eldest
Miss
Larkins
knows
officers
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
an
awful
thing
to
bear
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
them
speaking
to
her
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
them
cross
the
way
to
meet
her
,
<EOS>
when
her
bonnet
(
she
has
a
bright
taste
in
bonnets
)
is
seen
coming
down
the
pavement
,
accompanied
by
her
sister
's
bonnet
.
 
<EOS>
She
laughs
and
talks
,
and
seems
to
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
spend
a
good
deal
of
my
own
spare
time
in
walking
up
and
down
to
meet
her
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
can
bow
to
her
once
in
the
day
<EOS>
(
I
know
her
to
bow
to
,
knowing
Mr
Larkins
)
,
I
am
happier
.
 
<EOS>
I
deserve
a
bow
now
and
then
.
 
<EOS>
The
raging
agonies
I
suffer
on
the
night
of
the
Race
Ball
,
where
I
know
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
will
be
dancing
with
the
military
,
ought
to
have
some
compensation
,
if
there
be
even
-
handed
justice
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
My
passion
takes
away
my
appetite
,
and
makes
me
wear
my
newest
silk
neckerchief
continually
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
relief
<EOS>
but
in
putting
on
my
best
clothes
,
and
having
my
boots
cleaned
over
and
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
seem
,
then
,
to
be
worthier
of
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
that
belongs
to
her
,
or
is
connected
with
her
,
is
precious
to
me
.
<EOS>
Mr
Larkins
(
a
gruff
old
gentleman
with
a
double
chin
,
and
one
of
his
eyes
immovable
in
his
head
)
is
fraught
with
interest
to
me
.
<EOS>
When
I
ca
n't
meet
his
daughter
,
I
go
where
I
am
likely
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
To
say
"
How
do
you
do
,
Mr
Larkins
?
 
<EOS>
Are
the
young
ladies
and
all
the
family
quite
well
?
<EOS>
"
seems
so
pointed
,
that
I
blush
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
continually
about
my
age
.
 
<EOS>
Say
I
am
seventeen
,
and
say
that
seventeen
is
young
for
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
,
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
shall
be
one
-
and
-
twenty
in
no
time
almost
.
 
<EOS>
I
regularly
take
walks
outside
Mr
Larkins
's
house
in
the
evening
,
though
it
cuts
me
to
the
heart
to
see
the
officers
go
in
,
or
to
hear
them
up
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
where
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
plays
the
harp
.
<EOS>
I
even
walk
,
on
two
or
three
occasions
,
in
a
sickly
,
spoony
manner
,
round
and
round
the
house
after
the
family
are
gone
to
bed
,
wondering
which
is
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
's
chamber
(
and
pitching
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
now
,
on
Mr
Larkins
's
instead
)
;
wishing
that
a
fire
would
burst
out
;
that
the
assembled
crowd
would
stand
appalled
;
that
I
,
dashing
through
them
with
a
ladder
,
might
rear
it
against
her
window
,
save
her
in
my
arms
,
go
back
for
something
she
had
left
behind
,
and
perish
in
the
flames
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
am
generally
disinterested
in
my
love
,
and
think
I
could
be
content
to
make
a
figure
before
Miss
Larkins
,
and
expire
.
   
<EOS>
Generally
,
but
not
always
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
brighter
visions
rise
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
dress
(
the
occupation
of
two
hours
)
,
for
a
great
ball
given
at
the
Larkins
's
(
the
anticipation
of
three
weeks
)
,
I
indulge
my
fancy
with
pleasing
images
.
 
<EOS>
I
picture
myself
taking
courage
to
make
a
declaration
to
Miss
Larkins
.
 
<EOS>
I
picture
Miss
Larkins
sinking
her
head
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
saying
,
"
Oh
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
can
I
believe
my
ears
!
<EOS>
"
I
picture
Mr
Larkins
waiting
on
me
next
morning
,
and
saying
,
"
My
dear
Copperfield
,
my
daughter
has
told
me
all
.
<EOS>
Youth
is
no
objection
.
 
<EOS>
Here
are
twenty
thousand
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
Be
happy
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
picture
my
aunt
relenting
,
and
blessing
us
;
and
Mr
Dick
and
Doctor
Strong
being
present
at
the
marriage
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
sensible
fellow
<EOS>
,
I
believe
---
I
believe
,
on
looking
back
,
I
mean
---
<EOS>
and
modest
I
am
sure
;
but
all
this
goes
on
notwithstanding
.
<EOS>
I
repair
to
the
enchanted
house
,
where
there
are
lights
,
chattering
,
music
,
flowers
,
officers
<EOS>
(
I
am
sorry
to
see
)
,
and
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
,
a
blaze
of
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
dressed
in
blue
,
with
blue
flowers
in
her
hair
---
<EOS>
forget
-
me
-
nots
---
as
if
SHE
had
any
need
to
wear
forget
-
me
-
nots
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
first
really
grown
-
up
party
that
I
have
ever
been
invited
to
,
and
I
am
a
little
uncomfortable
;
for
I
appear
not
to
belong
to
anybody
,
and
nobody
appears
to
have
anything
to
say
to
me
,
except
Mr
Larkins
,
who
asks
me
how
my
schoolfellows
are
,
which
he
need
n't
do
,
as
I
have
not
come
there
to
be
insulted
.
   
<EOS>
But
after
I
have
stood
in
the
doorway
for
some
time
,
and
feasted
my
eyes
upon
the
goddess
of
my
heart
,
she
approaches
me
---
she
,
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
!
---
and
asks
me
pleasantly
,
if
I
dance
?
   
<EOS>
I
stammer
,
with
a
bow
,
"
With
you
,
Miss
Larkins
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
no
one
else
?
"
inquires
Miss
Larkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
no
pleasure
in
dancing
with
anyone
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Larkins
laughs
and
blushes
(
or
I
think
she
blushes
)
,
and
says
,
"
Next
time
but
one
,
I
shall
be
very
glad
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
time
arrives
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
waltz
,
I
think
,
"
Miss
Larkins
doubtfully
observes
,
when
I
present
myself
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
waltz
?
 
<EOS>
If
not
,
Captain
Bailey
---
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
But
I
do
waltz
(
pretty
well
,
too
,
as
it
happens
)
,
and
I
take
Miss
Larkins
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
her
sternly
from
the
side
of
Captain
Bailey
.
<EOS>
He
is
wretched
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
;
but
he
is
nothing
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
wretched
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
waltz
with
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
where
,
among
whom
,
or
how
long
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
know
that
I
swim
about
in
space
,
with
a
blue
angel
,
in
a
state
of
blissful
delirium
,
until
I
find
myself
alone
with
her
in
a
little
room
,
resting
on
a
sofa
.
<EOS>
She
admires
a
flower
(
pink
camellia
japonica
,
price
half
-
a
-
crown
)
,
in
my
button
-
hole
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
it
her
,
and
say
:
   
"
I
ask
an
inestimable
price
for
it
,
Miss
Larkins
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
 
<EOS>
What
is
that
?
<EOS>
"
returns
Miss
Larkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
flower
of
yours
,
that
I
may
treasure
it
as
a
miser
does
gold
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
bold
boy
,
"
says
Miss
Larkins
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
gives
it
me
,
not
displeased
;
and
I
put
it
to
my
lips
,
and
then
into
my
breast
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Larkins
,
laughing
,
draws
her
hand
through
my
arm
,
and
says
,
"
Now
take
me
back
to
Captain
Bailey
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
am
lost
in
the
recollection
of
this
delicious
interview
,
and
the
waltz
,
when
she
comes
to
me
again
,
with
a
plain
elderly
gentleman
who
has
been
playing
whist
all
night
,
upon
her
arm
,
and
says
:
   
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
here
is
my
bold
friend
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chestle
wants
to
know
you
,
Mr
Copperfield
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
feel
at
once
that
he
is
a
friend
of
the
family
,
and
am
much
gratified
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
admire
your
taste
,
sir
,
"
says
Mr
Chestle
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
does
you
credit
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
do
n't
take
much
interest
in
hops
;
but
I
am
a
pretty
large
grower
myself
;
and
if
you
ever
like
to
come
over
to
our
neighbourhood
---
neighbourhood
of
Ashford
---
and
take
a
run
about
our
place
,
---
we
shall
be
glad
for
you
to
stop
as
long
as
you
like
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
thank
Mr
Chestle
warmly
,
and
shake
hands
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
am
in
a
happy
dream
.
 
<EOS>
I
waltz
with
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
once
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
says
I
waltz
so
well
!
 
<EOS>
I
go
home
in
a
state
of
unspeakable
bliss
,
and
waltz
in
imagination
,
all
night
long
,
with
my
arm
round
the
blue
waist
of
my
dear
divinity
.
 
<EOS>
For
some
days
afterwards
,
I
am
lost
in
rapturous
reflections
;
but
I
neither
see
her
in
the
street
,
nor
when
I
call
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
imperfectly
consoled
for
this
disappointment
by
the
sacred
pledge
,
the
perished
flower
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trotwood

says
Agnes
,
one
day
after
dinner

<EOS>
"
Who
do
you
think
is
going
to
be
married
tomorrow

Someone
you
admire

Not

Agnes

Not

raising

cheerful
face
from

music
she
is
copying

Do

him

The

To

No

I
am
terribly
dejected
for
about
a
week
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
off
my
ring
<EOS>
,
I
wear
my
worst
clothes
,
I
use
no
bear
's
grease
,
and
I
frequently
lament
over
the
late
Miss
Larkins
's
faded
flower
.
<EOS>
Being
,
by
that
time
,
rather
tired
of
this
kind
of
life
,
and
having
received
new
provocation
from
the
butcher
,
I
throw
the
flower
away
,
go
out
with
the
butcher
,
and
gloriously
defeat
him
.
   
<EOS>
This
,
and
the
resumption
of
my
ring
,
as
well
as
of
the
bear
's
grease
in
moderation
,
are
the
last
marks
I
can
discern
,
now
,
in
my
progress
to
seventeen
.
      
<EOS>
Chapter
19
.
<EOS>
I
look
about
me
,
and
make
a
discovery
 
I
am
doubtful
whether
I
was
at
heart
glad
or
sorry
,
when
my
school
-
days
drew
to
an
end
,
and
the
time
came
for
my
leaving
Doctor
Strong
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
been
very
happy
there
,
I
had
a
great
attachment
for
the
Doctor
,
and
I
was
eminent
and
distinguished
in
that
little
world
.
 
<EOS>
For
these
reasons
I
was
sorry
to
go
;
but
for
other
reasons
,
unsubstantial
enough
,
I
was
glad
.
 
<EOS>
Misty
ideas
of
being
a
young
man
at
my
own
disposal
,
of
the
importance
attaching
to
a
young
man
at
his
own
disposal
,
of
the
wonderful
things
to
be
seen
and
done
by
that
magnificent
animal
,
and
the
wonderful
effects
he
could
not
fail
to
make
upon
society
,
lured
me
away
.
 
<EOS>
So
powerful
were
these
visionary
considerations
in
my
boyish
mind
,
that
I
seem
,
according
to
my
present
way
of
thinking
,
to
have
left
school
without
natural
regret
.
 
<EOS>
The
separation
has
not
made
the
impression
on
me
,
that
other
separations
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
in
vain
to
recall
how
I
felt
about
it
,
and
what
its
circumstances
were
;
but
it
is
not
momentous
in
my
recollection
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
opening
prospect
confused
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
my
juvenile
experiences
went
for
little
or
nothing
then
;
and
that
life
was
more
like
a
great
fairy
story
,
which
I
was
just
about
to
begin
to
read
,
than
anything
else
.
   
<EOS>
MY
aunt
<EOS>
and
I
had
held
many
grave
deliberations
on
the
calling
to
which
I
should
be
devoted
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
year
or
more
I
had
endeavoured
to
find
a
satisfactory
answer
to
her
often
-
repeated
question
,
"
What
I
would
like
to
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
But
I
had
no
particular
liking
,
that
I
could
discover
,
for
anything
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
could
have
been
inspired
with
a
knowledge
of
the
science
of
navigation
,
taken
the
command
of
a
fast
-
sailing
expedition
,
and
gone
round
the
world
on
a
triumphant
voyage
of
discovery
,
I
think
I
might
have
considered
myself
completely
suited
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
absence
of
any
such
miraculous
provision
,
my
desire
was
to
apply
myself
to
some
pursuit
that
would
not
lie
too
heavily
upon
her
purse
;
and
to
do
my
duty
in
it
,
whatever
it
might
be
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
had
regularly
assisted
at
our
councils
,
with
a
meditative
and
sage
demeanour
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
made
a
suggestion
but
once
;
and
on
that
occasion
(
I
do
n't
know
what
put
it
in
his
head
)
<EOS>
,
he
suddenly
proposed
that
I
should
be
"
a
Brazier
"
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
received
this
proposal
so
very
ungraciously
,
that
he
never
ventured
on
a
second
;
but
ever
afterwards
confined
himself
to
looking
watchfully
at
her
for
her
suggestions
,
and
rattling
his
money
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trot
,
I
tell
you
what
,
my
dear
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
one
morning
in
the
Christmas
season
when
I
left
school
:
"
as
this
knotty
point
is
still
unsettled
,
and
as
we
must
not
make
a
mistake
in
our
decision
if
we
can
help
it
,
I
think
we
had
better
take
a
little
breathing
-
time
.
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
,
you
must
try
to
look
at
it
from
a
new
point
of
view
,
and
not
as
a
schoolboy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
has
occurred
to
me
,
"
pursued
my
aunt
,
"
that
a
little
change
,
and
a
glimpse
of
life
out
of
doors
,
may
be
useful
in
helping
you
to
know
your
own
mind
,
and
form
a
cooler
judgement
.
 
<EOS>
Suppose
you
were
to
go
down
into
the
old
part
of
the
country
again
,
for
instance
,
and
see
that
---
that
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
woman
with
the
savagest
of
names
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
rubbing
her
nose
,
for
she
could
never
thoroughly
forgive
Peggotty
for
being
so
called
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
all
things
in
the
world
,
aunt
,
I
should
like
it
best
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
that
's
lucky
,
for
I
should
like
it
too
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
natural
and
rational
that
you
should
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
am
very
well
persuaded
that
whatever
you
do
,
Trot
,
will
always
be
natural
and
rational
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
aunt
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
sister
,
Betsey
Trotwood
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
would
have
been
as
natural
and
rational
a
girl
as
ever
breathed
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
be
worthy
of
her
,
wo
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
shall
be
worthy
of
YOU
,
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
That
will
be
enough
for
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
mercy
that
poor
dear
baby
of
a
mother
of
yours
did
n't
live
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
looking
at
me
approvingly
,
"
or
she
'd
have
been
so
vain
of
her
boy
by
this
time
,
that
her
soft
little
head
would
have
been
completely
turned
,
if
there
was
anything
of
it
left
to
turn
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
My
aunt
always
excused
any
weakness
of
her
own
in
my
behalf
,
by
transferring
it
in
this
way
to
my
poor
mother
.
)
<EOS>
"
Bless
me
,
<EOS>
Trotwood
,
how
you
do
remind
me
of
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pleasantly
,
I
hope
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
as
like
her
,
Dick
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
emphatically
,
"
he
's
as
like
her
,
as
she
was
that
afternoon
before
she
began
to
fret
<EOS>
---
bless
my
heart
,
he
's
as
like
her
,
as
he
can
look
at
me
out
of
his
two
eyes
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
indeed
?
"
said
Mr
Dick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
he
's
like
David
,
too
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
decisively
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
very
like
David
!
"
said
Mr
Dick
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
what
I
want
you
to
be
,
Trot
,
"
resumed
my
aunt
,
"
---
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
physically
,
but
morally
;
you
are
very
well
physically
---
is
,
a
firm
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
A
fine
firm
fellow
,
with
a
will
of
your
own
.
 
<EOS>
With
resolution
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
shaking
her
cap
at
me
,
and
clenching
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
With
determination
.
 
<EOS>
With
character
,
Trot
---
with
strength
of
character
that
is
not
to
be
influenced
,
except
on
good
reason
,
by
anybody
,
or
by
anything
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
want
you
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
your
father
and
mother
might
both
have
been
,
Heaven
knows
,
and
been
the
better
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
intimated
that
I
hoped
I
should
be
what
she
described
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
you
may
begin
,
in
a
small
way
,
to
have
a
reliance
upon
yourself
,
and
to
act
for
yourself
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
I
shall
send
you
upon
your
trip
,
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
think
,
once
,
of
Mr
Dick
's
going
with
you
;
but
,
on
second
thoughts
,
I
shall
keep
him
to
take
care
of
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
,
for
a
moment
,
looked
a
little
disappointed
;
until
the
honour
and
dignity
of
having
to
take
care
of
the
most
wonderful
woman
in
the
world
,
restored
the
sunshine
to
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
there
's
the
Memorial
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
in
a
hurry
,
"
I
intend
,
Trotwood
,
to
get
that
done
immediately
---
it
really
must
be
done
immediately
!
<EOS>
And
then
it
will
go
in
,
you
know
---
and
then
---
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
after
checking
himself
,
and
pausing
a
long
time
,
"
there
'll
be
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
pursuance
of
my
aunt
's
kind
scheme
,
I
was
shortly
afterwards
fitted
out
with
a
handsome
purse
of
money
,
and
a
portmanteau
,
and
tenderly
dismissed
upon
my
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
At
parting
,
my
aunt
gave
me
some
good
advice
,
and
a
good
many
kisses
;
and
said
that
as
her
object
was
that
I
should
look
about
me
,
and
should
think
a
little
,
she
would
recommend
me
to
stay
a
few
days
in
London
,
if
I
liked
it
,
either
on
my
way
down
into
Suffolk
,
or
in
coming
back
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
I
was
at
liberty
to
do
what
I
would
,
for
three
weeks
or
a
month
;
and
no
other
conditions
were
imposed
upon
my
freedom
than
the
before
-
mentioned
thinking
and
looking
about
me
,
and
a
pledge
to
write
three
times
a
week
and
faithfully
report
myself
.
   
<EOS>
I
went
to
Canterbury
first
,
that
I
might
take
leave
of
Agnes
and
Mr
Wickfield
<EOS>
(
my
old
room
in
whose
house
I
had
not
yet
relinquished
)
,
and
also
of
the
good
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
was
very
glad
to
see
me
,
and
told
me
that
the
house
had
not
been
like
itself
since
I
had
left
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
am
not
like
myself
when
I
am
away
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
seem
to
want
my
right
hand
,
when
I
miss
you
.
 
<EOS>
Though
that
's
not
saying
much
;
for
there
's
no
head
in
my
right
hand
,
and
no
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Everyone
who
knows
you
,
consults
with
you
,
and
is
guided
by
you
,
Agnes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Everyone
who
knows
me
,
spoils
me
,
I
believe
,
"
she
answered
,
smiling
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
it
's
because
you
are
like
no
one
else
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
so
good
,
and
so
sweet
-
tempered
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
such
a
gentle
nature
,
and
you
are
always
right
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
talk
,
"
said
Agnes
,
breaking
into
a
pleasant
laugh
,
as
she
sat
at
work
,
"
as
if
I
were
the
late
Miss
Larkins
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
fair
to
abuse
my
confidence
,
"
I
answered
,
reddening
at
the
recollection
of
my
blue
enslaver
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
confide
in
you
,
just
the
same
,
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
never
grow
out
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
I
fall
into
trouble
,
or
fall
in
love
,
I
shall
always
tell
you
,
if
you
'll
let
me
---
even
when
I
come
to
fall
in
love
in
earnest
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
have
always
been
in
earnest
!
"
<EOS>
said
Agnes
,
laughing
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
was
as
a
child
,
or
a
schoolboy
,
"
said
I
,
laughing
in
my
turn
,
not
without
being
a
little
shame
-
faced
.
 
<EOS>
"
Times
are
altering
now
,
and
I
suppose
I
shall
be
in
a
terrible
state
of
earnestness
one
day
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
My
wonder
is
,
that
you
are
not
in
earnest
yourself
,
by
this
time
,
Agnes
.
"
   
<EOS>
Agnes
laughed
again
,
and
shook
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
know
you
are
not
!
"
<EOS>
said
I
,
"
because
if
you
had
been
you
would
have
told
me
.
 
<EOS>
Or
at
least
"
---
for
I
saw
a
faint
blush
in
her
face
<EOS>
,
"
you
would
have
let
me
find
it
out
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
is
no
one
that
I
know
of
,
who
deserves
to
love
you
,
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
Someone
of
a
nobler
character
,
and
more
worthy
altogether
than
anyone
I
have
ever
seen
here
,
must
rise
up
,
before
I
give
my
consent
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
time
to
come
,
I
shall
have
a
wary
eye
on
all
admirers
;
and
shall
exact
a
great
deal
from
the
successful
one
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
We
had
gone
on
,
so
far
,
in
a
mixture
of
confidential
jest
and
earnest
,
that
had
long
grown
naturally
out
of
our
familiar
relations
,
begun
as
mere
children
.
 
<EOS>
But
Agnes
,
now
suddenly
lifting
up
her
eyes
to
mine
,
and
speaking
in
a
different
manner
,
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
Trotwood
,
there
is
something
that
I
want
to
ask
you
,
and
that
I
may
not
have
another
opportunity
of
asking
for
a
long
time
,
perhaps
---
something
I
would
ask
,
I
think
,
of
no
one
else
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
observed
any
gradual
alteration
in
Papa
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
had
observed
it
,
and
had
often
wondered
whether
she
had
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
shown
as
much
,
now
,
in
my
face
;
for
her
eyes
were
in
a
moment
cast
down
,
and
I
saw
tears
in
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
what
it
is
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
low
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
---
shall
I
be
quite
plain
,
Agnes
,
liking
him
so
much
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
does
himself
no
good
by
the
habit
that
has
increased
upon
him
since
I
first
came
here
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
often
very
nervous
---
or
I
fancy
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
fancy
,
"
said
Agnes
,
shaking
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
hand
trembles
,
his
speech
is
not
plain
,
and
his
eyes
look
wild
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
remarked
that
at
those
times
,
and
when
he
is
least
like
himself
,
he
is
most
certain
to
be
wanted
on
some
business
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
Uriah
,
"
said
Agnes
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
<EOS>
and
the
sense
of
being
unfit
for
it
,
or
of
not
having
understood
it
,
or
of
having
shown
his
condition
in
spite
of
himself
,
seems
to
make
him
so
uneasy
,
that
next
day
he
is
worse
,
and
next
day
worse
,
and
so
he
becomes
jaded
and
haggard
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
be
alarmed
by
what
I
say
,
Agnes
,
but
in
this
state
I
saw
him
,
only
the
other
evening
,
lay
down
his
head
upon
his
desk
,
and
shed
tears
like
a
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
hand
passed
softly
before
my
lips
while
I
was
yet
speaking
,
and
in
a
moment
she
had
met
her
father
at
the
door
of
the
room
,
and
was
hanging
on
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
The
expression
of
her
face
,
as
they
both
looked
towards
me
<EOS>
,
I
felt
to
be
very
touching
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
such
deep
fondness
for
him
,
and
gratitude
to
him
for
all
his
love
and
care
,
in
her
beautiful
look
;
and
there
was
such
a
fervent
appeal
to
me
to
deal
tenderly
by
him
,
even
in
my
inmost
thoughts
,
and
to
let
no
harsh
construction
find
any
place
against
him
;
she
was
,
at
once
,
so
proud
of
him
and
devoted
to
him
,
yet
so
compassionate
and
sorry
,
and
so
reliant
upon
me
to
be
so
,
too
;
that
nothing
she
could
have
said
would
have
expressed
more
to
me
,
or
moved
me
more
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
to
drink
tea
at
the
Doctor
's
.
 
<EOS>
We
went
there
at
the
usual
hour
;
and
round
the
study
fireside
found
the
Doctor
,
and
his
young
wife
,
and
her
mother
.
 
<EOS>
The
Doctor
,
who
made
as
much
of
my
going
away
as
if
I
were
going
to
China
,
received
me
as
an
honoured
guest
;
and
called
for
a
log
of
wood
to
be
thrown
on
the
fire
,
that
he
might
see
the
face
of
his
old
pupil
reddening
in
the
blaze
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
see
many
more
new
faces
in
Trotwood
's
stead
,
Wickfield
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
warming
his
hands
;
"
I
am
getting
lazy
,
and
want
ease
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
relinquish
all
my
young
people
in
another
six
months
,
and
lead
a
quieter
life
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
said
so
,
any
time
these
ten
years
,
Doctor
,
"
Mr
Wickfield
answered
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
now
I
mean
to
do
it
,
"
returned
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
first
master
will
succeed
me
---
I
am
in
earnest
at
last
---
so
you
'll
soon
have
to
arrange
our
contracts
,
and
to
bind
us
firmly
to
them
,
like
a
couple
of
knaves
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
to
take
care
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
,
"
that
you
're
not
imposed
on
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
As
you
certainly
would
be
,
in
any
contract
you
should
make
for
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
ready
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
worse
tasks
than
that
,
in
my
calling
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
nothing
to
think
of
then
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
with
a
smile
,
"
but
my
Dictionary
;
and
this
other
contract
-
bargain
---
Annie
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Wickfield
glanced
towards
her
,
sitting
at
the
tea
table
by
Agnes
,
she
seemed
to
me
to
avoid
his
look
with
such
unwonted
hesitation
and
timidity
,
that
his
attention
became
fixed
upon
her
,
as
if
something
were
suggested
to
his
thoughts
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
post
come
in
from
India
,
I
observe
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
short
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
the
by
!
and
letters
from
Mr
Jack
Maldon
!
"
said
the
Doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
dear
Jack
!
"
said
Mrs
Markleham
,
shaking
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
trying
climate
!
<EOS>
---
like
living
,
they
tell
me
,
on
a
sand
-
heap
,
underneath
a
burning
-
glass
!
 
<EOS>
He
looked
strong
,
but
he
was
n't
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Doctor
,
it
was
his
spirit
,
not
his
constitution
,
that
he
ventured
on
so
boldly
.
 
<EOS>
Annie
,
my
dear
,
I
am
sure
you
must
perfectly
recollect
that
your
cousin
never
was
strong
---
not
what
can
be
called
ROBUST
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mrs
Markleham
,
with
emphasis
,
and
looking
round
upon
us
generally
,
"
---
from
the
time
when
my
daughter
and
himself
were
children
together
,
and
walking
about
,
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
the
livelong
day
.
"
   
<EOS>
Annie
,
thus
addressed
,
made
no
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
I
gather
from
what
you
say
,
ma'am
,
that
Mr
Maldon
is
ill
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Mr
 
Wickfield
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ill
!
"
replied
the
Old
Soldier
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sir
,
he
's
all
sorts
of
things
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Except
well
?
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Except
well
,
indeed
!
"
said
the
Old
Soldier
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
had
dreadful
strokes
of
the
sun
,
no
doubt
,
and
jungle
fevers
and
agues
,
and
every
kind
of
thing
you
can
mention
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
his
liver
,
"
said
the
Old
Soldier
resignedly
,
"
that
,
of
course
,
he
gave
up
altogether
,
when
he
first
went
out
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
he
say
all
this
?
"
asked
Mr
Wickfield
.
   
<EOS>
"
Say
?
 
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Markleham
,
shaking
her
head
and
her
fan
,
"
<EOS>
you
little
know
my
poor
Jack
Maldon
when
you
ask
that
question
.
 
<EOS>
Say
?
 
<EOS>
Not
he
.
 
<EOS>
You
might
drag
him
at
the
heels
of
four
wild
horses
first
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mama
!
"
said
Mrs
Strong
.
   
<EOS>
"
Annie
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
her
mother
,
"
once
for
all
,
I
must
really
beg
that
you
will
not
interfere
with
me
,
unless
it
is
to
confirm
what
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
as
well
as
I
do
that
your
cousin
Maldon
would
be
dragged
at
the
heels
of
any
number
of
wild
horses

why
should
I
confine
myself

four

<EOS>
I
WON'T
confine
myself
to
four
---
eight
,
sixteen
,
two
-
and
-
thirty
,
rather
than
say
anything
calculated
to
overturn
the
Doctor
's
plans
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wickfield
's
plans
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
stroking
his
face
,
and
looking
penitently
at
his
adviser
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
to
say
,
our
joint
plans
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
myself
,
abroad
or
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
said
"
added
Mr
Wickfield
gravely
,
"
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
the
means
of
sending
him
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
my
responsibility
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
Responsibility
!
"
said
the
Old
Soldier
.
 
<EOS>
"
Everything
was
done
for
the
best
,
my
dear
Mr
Wickfield
;
everything
was
done
for
the
kindest
and
best
,
we
know
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
the
dear
fellow
ca
n't
live
there
,
he
ca
n't
live
there
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
he
ca
n't
live
there
,
he
'll
die
there
,
sooner
than
he
'll
overturn
the
Doctor
's
plans
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
him
,
"
said
the
Old
Soldier
,
fanning
herself
,
in
a
sort
of
calm
prophetic
agony
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
know
he
'll
die
there
,
sooner
than
he
'll
overturn
the
Doctor
's
plans
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
ma'am
,
"
said
the
Doctor
cheerfully
,
"
I
am
not
bigoted
to
my
plans
,
and
I
can
overturn
them
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
substitute
some
other
plans
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mr
Jack
Maldon
comes
home
on
account
of
ill
health
,
he
must
not
be
allowed
to
go
back
,
and
we
must
endeavour
to
make
some
more
suitable
and
fortunate
provision
for
him
in
this
country
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Markleham
was
so
overcome
by
this
generous
speech
---
which
,
I
need
not
say
,
she
had
not
at
all
expected
or
led
up
to
---
that
she
could
only
tell
the
Doctor
it
was
like
himself
,
and
go
several
times
through
that
operation
of
kissing
the
sticks
of
her
fan
,
and
then
tapping
his
hand
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
After
which
she
gently
chid
her
daughter
Annie
,
for
not
being
more
demonstrative
when
such
kindnesses
were
showered
,
for
her
sake
,
on
her
old
playfellow
;
and
entertained
us
with
some
particulars
concerning
other
deserving
members
of
her
family
,
whom
it
was
desirable
to
set
on
their
deserving
legs
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
her
daughter
Annie
never
once
spoke
,
or
lifted
up
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
Mr
Wickfield
had
his
glance
upon
her
as
she
sat
by
his
own
daughter
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
It
appeared
to
me
that
he
never
thought
of
being
observed
by
anyone
;
but
was
so
intent
upon
her
,
and
upon
his
own
thoughts
in
connexion
with
her
,
as
to
be
quite
absorbed
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
asked
what
Mr
Jack
Maldon
had
actually
written
in
reference
to
himself
,
and
to
whom
he
had
written
?
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
here
,
"
said
Mrs
Markleham
,
taking
a
letter
from
the
chimney
-
piece
above
the
Doctor
's
head
,
"
the
dear
fellow
says
to
the
Doctor
himself
---
where
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
---
"
I
am
sorry
to
inform
you
that
my
health
is
suffering
severely
,
and
that
I
fear
I
may
be
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
returning
home
for
a
time
,
as
the
only
hope
of
restoration
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
pretty
plain
,
poor
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
His
only
hope
of
restoration
!
 
<EOS>
But
Annie
's
letter
is
plainer
still
.
 
<EOS>
Annie
,
show
me
that
letter
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
now
,
mama
,
"
she
pleaded
in
a
low
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
you
absolutely
are
,
on
some
subjects
,
one
of
the
most
ridiculous
persons
in
the
world
,
"
returned
her
mother
,
"
and
perhaps
the
most
unnatural
to
the
claims
of
your
own
family
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
should
have
heard
of
the
letter
at
all
,
I
believe
,
unless
I
had
asked
for
it
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
call
that
confidence
,
my
love
,
towards
Doctor
Strong
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
You
ought
to
know
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
letter
was
reluctantly
produced
;
and
as
I
handed
it
to
the
old
lady
,
I
saw
how
the
unwilling
hand
from
which
I
took
it
,
trembled
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
let
us
see
,
"
said
Mrs
Markleham
,
putting
her
glass
to
her
eye
,
"
where
the
passage
is
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
remembrance
of
old
times
,
my
dearest
Annie
"
---
<EOS>
and
so
forth
<EOS>
---
it
's
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
amiable
old
Proctor
"
---
who
's
he
?
 
<EOS>
Dear
me
,
Annie
,
how
illegibly
your
cousin
Maldon
writes
,
and
how
stupid
I
am
!
 
<EOS>
"
Doctor
,
"
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
amiable
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
she
left
off
,
to
kiss
her
fan
again
,
and
shake
it
at
the
Doctor
,
who
was
looking
at
us
in
a
state
of
placid
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
I
have
found
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
not
be
surprised
to
hear
,
Annie
,
"
---
<EOS>
no
,
to
be
sure
,
knowing
that
he
never
was
really
strong
;
what
did
I
say
just
now
?
---
"
that
I
have
undergone
so
much
in
this
distant
place
,
as
to
have
decided
to
leave
it
at
all
hazards
;
on
sick
leave
,
if
I
can
;
on
total
resignation
,
if
that
is
not
to
be
obtained
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
have
endured
,
and
do
endure
here
,
is
insupportable
.
"
<EOS>
And
but
for
the
promptitude
of
that
best
of
creatures
,
"
said
Mrs
Markleham
,
telegraphing
the
Doctor
as
before
,
and
refolding
the
letter
,
"
it
would
be
insupportable
to
me
to
think
of
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
said
not
one
word
,
though
the
old
lady
looked
to
him
as
if
for
his
commentary
on
this
intelligence
;
but
sat
severely
silent
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Long
after
the
subject
was
dismissed
,
and
other
topics
occupied
us
,
he
remained
so
;
seldom
raising
his
eyes
,
unless
to
rest
them
for
a
moment
,
with
a
thoughtful
frown
,
upon
the
Doctor
,
or
his
wife
,
or
both
.
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
was
very
fond
of
music
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
sang
with
great
sweetness
and
expression
,
and
so
did
Mrs
Strong
.
 
<EOS>
They
sang
together
,
and
played
duets
together
,
and
we
had
quite
a
little
concert
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
remarked
two
things
:
<EOS>
first
,
that
though
Annie
soon
recovered
her
composure
,
and
was
quite
herself
,
there
was
a
blank
between
her
and
Mr
Wickfield
which
separated
them
wholly
from
each
other
;
secondly
,
that
Mr
Wickfield
seemed
to
dislike
the
intimacy
between
her
and
Agnes
,
and
to
watch
it
with
uneasiness
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
I
must
confess
,
the
recollection
of
what
I
had
seen
on
that
night
when
Mr
Maldon
went
away
,
first
began
to
return
upon
me
with
a
meaning
it
had
never
had
,
and
to
trouble
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
innocent
beauty
of
her
face
was
not
as
innocent
to
me
as
it
had
been
;
I
mistrusted
the
natural
grace
and
charm
of
her
manner
;
and
when
I
looked
at
Agnes
by
her
side
,
and
thought
how
good
and
true
Agnes
was
,
suspicions
arose
within
me
that
it
was
an
ill
-
assorted
friendship
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
so
happy
in
it
herself
,
however
,
and
the
other
was
so
happy
too
,
that
they
made
the
evening
fly
away
as
if
it
were
but
an
hour
.
<EOS>
It
closed
in
an
incident
which
I
well
remember
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
taking
leave
of
each
other
,
and
Agnes
was
going
to
embrace
her
and
kiss
her
,
when
Mr
Wickfield
stepped
between
them
,
as
if
by
accident
,
and
drew
Agnes
quickly
away
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
saw
,
as
though
all
the
intervening
time
had
been
cancelled
,
and
I
were
still
standing
in
the
doorway
on
the
night
of
the
departure
,
the
expression
of
that
night
in
the
face
of
Mrs
Strong
,
as
it
confronted
his
.
   
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
what
an
impression
this
made
upon
me
,
or
<EOS>
how
impossible
I
found
it
,
when
I
thought
of
her
afterwards
,
to
separate
her
from
this
look
,
and
remember
her
face
in
its
innocent
loveliness
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
haunted
me
when
I
got
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
seemed
to
have
left
the
Doctor
's
roof
with
a
dark
cloud
lowering
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
reverence
that
I
had
for
his
grey
head
,
was
mingled
with
commiseration
for
his
faith
in
those
who
were
treacherous
to
him
,
and
with
resentment
against
those
who
injured
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
impending
shadow
of
a
great
affliction
,
and
a
great
disgrace
that
had
no
distinct
form
in
it
yet
,
fell
like
a
stain
upon
the
quiet
place
where
I
had
worked
and
played
as
a
boy
,
and
did
it
a
cruel
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
pleasure
in
thinking
,
any
more
,
of
the
grave
old
broad
-
leaved
aloe
-
trees
,
which
remained
shut
up
in
themselves
a
hundred
years
together
,
and
of
the
trim
smooth
grass
-
plot
,
and
the
stone
urns
,
and
the
Doctor
's
walk
,
and
the
congenial
sound
of
the
Cathedral
bell
hovering
above
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
the
tranquil
sanctuary
of
my
boyhood
had
been
sacked
before
my
face
,
and
its
peace
and
honour
given
to
the
winds
.
   
<EOS>
But
morning
brought
with
it
my
parting
from
the
old
house
,
which
Agnes
had
filled
with
her
influence
;
and
that
occupied
my
mind
sufficiently
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
there
again
soon
,
no
doubt
;
I
might
sleep
again
---
perhaps
often
---
in
my
old
room
;
but
the
days
of
my
inhabiting
there
were
gone
,
and
the
old
time
was
past
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
heavier
at
heart
when
I
packed
up
such
of
my
books
and
clothes
as
still
remained
there
to
be
sent
to
Dover
,
than
I
cared
to
show
to
Uriah
Heep
;
who
was
so
officious
to
help
me
,
<EOS>
that
I
uncharitably
thought
him
mighty
glad
that
I
was
going
.
   
<EOS>
I
got
away
from
Agnes
and
her
father
,
somehow
,
with
an
indifferent
show
of
being
very
manly
,
and
took
my
seat
upon
the
box
of
the
London
coach
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
softened
and
forgiving
,
going
through
the
town
,
that
I
had
half
a
mind
to
nod
to
my
old
enemy
the
butcher
,
and
throw
him
five
shillings
to
drink
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
looked
such
a
very
obdurate
butcher
as
he
stood
scraping
the
great
block
in
the
shop
,
and
moreover
,
his
appearance
was
so
little
improved
by
the
loss
of
a
front
tooth
which
I
had
knocked
out
<EOS>
,
that
I
thought
it
best
to
make
no
advances
.
   
<EOS>
The
main
object
on
my
mind
<EOS>
,
I
remember
,
when
we
got
fairly
on
the
road
,
was
to
appear
as
old
as
possible
to
the
coachman
,
and
to
speak
extremely
gruff
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
point
I
achieved
at
great
personal
inconvenience
;
but
<EOS>
I
stuck
to
it
,
because
I
felt
it
was
a
grown
-
up
sort
of
thing
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
going
through
,
sir
?
"
said
the
coachman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
William
,
"
<EOS>
I
said
,
condescendingly
(
I
knew
him
)
;
"
I
am
going
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
go
down
into
Suffolk
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shooting
,
sir
?
"
said
the
coachman
.
   
<EOS>
He
knew
as
well
as
I
did
that
it
was
just
as
likely
,
at
that
time
of
year
,
I
was
going
down
there
whaling
;
but
I
felt
complimented
,
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
I
said
,
pretending
to
be
undecided
,
"
whether
I
shall
take
a
shot
or
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Birds
is
got
wery
shy
,
I
'm
told
,
"
said
William
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
I
understand
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Suffolk
your
county
,
sir
?
"
asked
William
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
,
with
some
importance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Suffolk
's
my
county
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
told
the
dumplings
is
uncommon
fine
down
there
,
"
said
William
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
not
aware
of
it
myself
,
but
I
felt
it
necessary
to
uphold
the
institutions
of
my
county
,
and
to
evince
a
familiarity
with
them
;
so
I
shook
my
head
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
I
believe
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
Punches
,
"
said
William
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
cattle
!
 
<EOS>
A
Suffolk
Punch
,
when
he
's
a
good
un
,
is
worth
his
weight
in
gold
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
breed
any
Suffolk
Punches
yourself
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
N
-
no
,
"
I
said
,
"
not
exactly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
gen'lm'n
behind
me
,
I
'll
pound
it
,
"
said
William
,
"
as
has
bred
'em
by
wholesale
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
spoken
of
was
a
gentleman
with
a
very
unpromising
squint
,
and
a
prominent
chin
,
who
had
a
tall
white
hat
on
with
a
narrow
flat
brim
,
and
whose
close
-
fitting
drab
trousers
seemed
to
button
all
the
way
up
outside
his
legs
from
his
boots
to
his
hips
.
<EOS>
His
chin
was
cocked
over
the
coachman
's
shoulder
,
so
near
to
me
,
that
his
breath
quite
tickled
the
back
of
my
head
;
and
as
I
looked
at
him
,
he
leered
at
the
leaders
with
the
eye
with
which
he
did
n't
squint
,
in
a
very
knowing
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ai
n't
you
?
"
asked
William
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ai
n't
I
what
?
"
said
the
gentleman
behind
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bred
them
Suffolk
Punches
by
wholesale
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
ai
n't
no
sort
of
orse
that
I
ai
n't
bred
,
and
no
sort
of
dorg
.
 
<EOS>
Orses
and
dorgs
is
some
men
's
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
They
're
wittles
and
drink
to
me
---
<EOS>
lodging
,
wife
,
and
children
---
reading
,
writing
,
and
Arithmetic
---
snuff
,
tobacker
,
and
sleep
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
ai
n't
a
sort
of
man
to
see
sitting
behind
a
coach
-
box
,
is
it
though
?
"
said
William
in
my
ear
,
as
he
handled
the
reins
.
   
<EOS>
I
construed
this
remark
into
an
indication
of
a
wish
that
he
should
have
my
place
,
so
I
blushingly
offered
to
resign
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
,
sir
,
"
said
William
,
"
I
think
it
would
be
more
correct
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
always
considered
this
as
the
first
fall
I
had
in
life
.
<EOS>
When
I
booked
my
place
at
the
coach
office
<EOS>
I
had
had
"
Box
Seat
"
written
against
the
entry
,
and
had
given
the
book
-
keeper
half
-
a
-
crown
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
got
up
in
a
special
great
-
coat
and
shawl
,
expressly
to
do
honour
to
that
distinguished
eminence
;
had
glorified
myself
upon
it
a
good
deal
;
and
had
felt
that
I
was
a
credit
to
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
,
in
the
very
first
stage
,
I
was
supplanted
by
a
shabby
man
with
a
squint
,
who
had
no
other
merit
than
smelling
like
a
livery
-
stables
,
and
being
able
to
walk
across
me
,
more
like
a
fly
than
a
human
being
,
while
the
horses
were
at
a
canter
!
   
<EOS>
A
distrust
of
myself
,
which
has
often
beset
me
in
life
on
small
occasions
,
when
it
would
have
been
better
away
,
was
assuredly
not
stopped
in
its
growth
by
this
little
incident
outside
the
Canterbury
coach
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
to
take
refuge
in
gruffness
of
speech
.
 
<EOS>
I
spoke
from
the
pit
of
my
stomach
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
,
but
<EOS>
I
felt
completely
extinguished
,
and
dreadfully
young
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
curious
and
interesting
,
nevertheless
,
to
be
sitting
up
there
behind
four
horses
:
well
educated
,
well
dressed
,
and
with
plenty
of
money
in
my
pocket
;
and
to
look
out
for
the
places
where
I
had
slept
on
my
weary
journey
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
abundant
occupation
for
my
thoughts
,
in
every
conspicuous
landmark
on
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
looked
down
at
the
trampers
whom
we
passed
,
and
saw
that
well
-
remembered
style
of
face
turned
up
,
I
felt
as
if
the
tinker
's
blackened
hand
were
in
the
bosom
of
my
shirt
again
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
clattered
through
the
narrow
street
of
Chatham
,
and
I
caught
a
glimpse
,
in
passing
,
of
the
lane
where
the
old
monster
lived
who
had
bought
my
jacket
<EOS>
,
I
stretched
my
neck
eagerly
to
look
for
the
place
where
I
had
sat
,
in
the
sun
and
in
the
shade
,
waiting
for
my
money
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
came
,
at
last
,
within
a
stage
of
London
,
and
passed
the
veritable
Salem
House
where
Mr
Creakle
had
laid
about
him
with
a
heavy
hand
,
I
would
have
given
all
I
had
,
for
lawful
permission
to
get
down
and
thrash
him
,
and
let
all
the
boys
out
like
so
many
caged
sparrows
.
   
<EOS>
We
went
to
the
Golden
Cross
at
Charing
Cross
,
then
<EOS>
a
mouldy
sort
of
establishment
in
a
close
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
A
waiter
showed
me
into
the
coffee
-
room
;
and
a
chambermaid
introduced
me
to
my
small
bedchamber
,
which
smelt
like
a
hackney
-
coach
,
and
was
shut
up
like
a
family
vault
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
still
painfully
conscious
of
my
youth
,
for
nobody
stood
in
any
awe
of
me
at
all
:
the
chambermaid
being
utterly
indifferent
to
my
opinions
on
any
subject
,
and
the
waiter
being
familiar
with
me
,
and
offering
advice
to
my
inexperience
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
now
,
"
said
the
waiter
,
in
a
tone
of
confidence
,
"
what
would
you
like
for
dinner
?
 
<EOS>
Young
gentlemen
likes
poultry
in
general
:
have
a
fowl
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
told
him
,
as
majestically
as
I
could
,
that
I
was
n't
in
the
humour
for
a
fowl
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ai
n't
you
?
"
said
the
waiter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Young
gentlemen
is
generally
tired
of
beef
and
mutton
:
have
a
weal
cutlet
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
assented
to
this
proposal
,
in
default
of
being
able
to
suggest
anything
else
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
care
for
taters
?
"
said
the
waiter
,
with
an
insinuating
smile
,
and
his
head
on
one
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
Young
gentlemen
generally
has
been
overdosed
with
taters
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
commanded
him
,
in
my
deepest
voice
,
to
order
a
veal
cutlet
and
potatoes
,
and
all
things
fitting
;
and
to
inquire
at
the
bar
if
there
were
any
letters
for
Trotwood
Copperfield
,
Esquire
---
which
I
knew
there
were
not
,
and
could
n't
be
,
but
thought
it
manly
to
appear
to
expect
.
   
<EOS>
He
soon
came
back
to
say
that
there
were
none
(
at
which
I
was
much
surprised
)
and
began
to
lay
the
cloth
for
my
dinner
in
a
box
by
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
so
engaged
,
he
asked
me
what
I
would
take
with
it
;
and
on
my
replying
"
Half
a
pint
of
sherry
,
"
thought
it
a
favourable
opportunity
,
I
am
afraid
,
to
extract
that
measure
of
wine
from
the
stale
leavings
at
the
bottoms
of
several
small
decanters
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
of
this
opinion
,
because
,
while
I
was
reading
the
newspaper
,
I
observed
him
behind
a
low
wooden
partition
,
which
was
his
private
apartment
,
very
busy
pouring
out
of
a
number
of
those
vessels
into
one
,
like
a
chemist
and
druggist
making
up
a
prescription
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
wine
came
,
too
,
I
thought
it
flat
;
and
it
certainly
had
more
English
crumbs
in
it
,
than
were
to
be
expected
in
a
foreign
wine
in
anything
like
a
pure
state
,
but
I
was
bashful
enough
to
drink
it
,
and
say
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
Being
then
in
a
pleasant
frame
of
mind
(
from
which
I
infer
that
poisoning
is
not
always
disagreeable
in
some
stages
of
the
process
)
,
I
resolved
to
go
to
the
play
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Covent
Garden
Theatre
that
I
chose
;
and
there
,
from
the
back
of
a
centre
box
,
I
saw
Julius
Caesar
and
the
new
Pantomime
.
 
<EOS>
To
have
all
those
noble
Romans
alive
before
me
,
and
walking
in
and
out
for
my
entertainment
,
instead
of
being
the
stern
taskmasters
they
had
been
at
school
,
was
a
most
novel
and
delightful
effect
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
mingled
reality
and
mystery
of
the
whole
show
,
the
influence
upon
me
of
the
poetry
,
the
lights
,
the
music
,
the
company
,
the
smooth
stupendous
changes
of
glittering
and
brilliant
scenery
,
were
so
dazzling
,
and
opened
up
such
illimitable
regions
of
delight
,
that
when
I
came
out
into
the
rainy
street
,
at
twelve
o'clock
at
night
,
I
felt
as
if
I
had
come
from
the
clouds
,
where
I
had
been
leading
a
romantic
life
for
ages
,
to
a
bawling
,
splashing
,
link
-
lighted
,
umbrella
-
struggling
,
hackney
-
coach
-
jostling
,
patten
-
clinking
,
muddy
,
miserable
world
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
emerged
by
another
door
,
and
stood
in
the
street
for
a
little
while
,
as
if
I
really
were
a
stranger
upon
earth
:
but
the
unceremonious
pushing
and
hustling
that
I
received
,
soon
recalled
me
to
myself
,
and
put
me
in
the
road
back
to
the
hotel
;
whither
I
went
,
revolving
the
glorious
vision
all
the
way
;
and
where
,
after
some
porter
and
oysters
,
I
sat
revolving
it
still
,
at
past
one
o'clock
,
with
my
eyes
on
the
coffee
-
room
fire
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
so
filled
with
the
play
,
and
with
the
past
<EOS>
---
for
it
was
,
in
a
manner
,
like
a
shining
transparency
,
through
which
I
saw
my
earlier
life
moving
along
---
that
I
do
n't
know
when
the
figure
of
a
handsome
well
-
formed
young
man
dressed
with
a
tasteful
easy
negligence
which
I
have
reason
to
remember
very
well
,
became
a
real
presence
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
recollect
being
conscious
of
his
company
without
having
noticed
his
coming
in
---
and
my
still
sitting
,
musing
,
over
the
coffee
-
room
fire
.
   
<EOS>
At
last
I
rose
to
go
to
bed
,
much
to
the
relief
of
the
sleepy
waiter
,
who
had
got
the
fidgets
in
his
legs
,
and
was
twisting
them
,
and
hitting
them
,
and
putting
them
through
all
kinds
of
contortions
in
his
small
pantry
.
 
<EOS>
In
going
towards
the
door
,
I
passed
the
person
who
had
come
in
,
and
saw
him
plainly
.
 
<EOS>
I
turned
directly
,
came
back
,
and
looked
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
me
,
but
I
knew
him
in
a
moment
.
   
<EOS>
At
another
time
I
might
have
wanted
the
confidence
or
the
decision
to
speak
to
him
,
and
might
have
put
it
off
until
next
day
,
and
might
have
lost
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
then
condition
of
my
mind
,
where
the
play
was
still
running
high
,
his
former
protection
of
me
appeared
so
deserving
of
my
gratitude
,
and
my
old
love
for
him
overflowed
my
breast
so
freshly
and
spontaneously
,
that
I
went
up
to
him
at
once
,
with
a
fast
-
beating
heart
,
and
said
:
   
"
Steerforth
!
<EOS>
wo
n't
you
speak
to
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
---
just
as
he
used
to
look
,
sometimes
---
<EOS>
but
I
saw
no
recognition
in
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
remember
me
,
I
am
afraid
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
My
God
!
"
<EOS>
he
suddenly
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
little
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
grasped
him
by
both
hands
,
and
could
not
let
them
go
.
 
<EOS>
But
for
very
shame
,
and
the
fear
that
it
might
displease
him
,
I
could
have
held
him
round
the
neck
and
cried
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
,
never
,
never
was
so
glad
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Steerforth
,
I
am
so
overjoyed
to
see
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
rejoiced
to
see
you
,
too
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
shaking
my
hands
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Copperfield
,
old
boy
,
do
n't
be
overpowered
!
"
<EOS>
And
yet
he
was
glad
,
too
,
I
thought
,
to
see
how
the
delight
I
had
in
meeting
him
affected
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
brushed
away
the
tears
that
my
utmost
resolution
had
not
been
able
to
keep
back
,
and
I
made
a
clumsy
laugh
of
it
,
and
we
sat
down
together
,
side
by
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
do
you
come
to
be
here
?
<EOS>
"
said
Steerforth
,
clapping
me
on
the
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
came
here
by
the
Canterbury
coach
,
today
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
adopted
by
an
aunt
down
in
that
part
of
the
country
,
and
have
just
finished
my
education
there
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
YOU
come
to
be
here
,
Steerforth
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
am
what
they
call
an
Oxford
man
,
"
he
returned
;
"
that
is
to
say
,
I
get
bored
to
death
down
there
,
periodically
---
<EOS>
and
I
am
on
my
way
now
to
my
mother
's
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
devilish
amiable
-
looking
fellow
,
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
just
what
you
used
to
be
,
now
I
look
at
you
!
 
<EOS>
Not
altered
in
the
least
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
immediately
,
"
I
said
;
"
but
you
are
more
easily
remembered
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
laughed
as
he
ran
his
hand
through
the
clustering
curls
of
his
hair
,
and
said
gaily
:
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
on
an
expedition
of
duty
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
lives
a
little
way
out
of
town
;
and
the
roads
being
in
a
beastly
condition
,
and
our
house
tedious
enough
,
I
remained
here
tonight
instead
of
going
on
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
in
town
half
-
a
-
dozen
hours
,
and
those
I
have
been
dozing
and
grumbling
away
at
the
play
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
at
the
play
,
too
,
"
said
I.
 
"
At
Covent
Garden
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
delightful
and
magnificent
entertainment
,
Steerforth
!
"
   
<EOS>
Steerforth
laughed
heartily
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
young
Davy
,
"
he
said
,
clapping
me
on
the
shoulder
again
,
"
you
are
a
very
Daisy
.
 
<EOS>
The
daisy
of
the
field
,
at
sunrise
,
is
not
fresher
than
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
at
Covent
Garden
,
too
,
and
there
never
was
a
more
miserable
business
.
 
<EOS>
Holloa
,
you
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
addressed
to
the
waiter
,
who
had
been
very
attentive
to
our
recognition
,
at
a
distance
,
and
now
came
forward
deferentially
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
have
you
put
my
friend
,
Mr
Copperfield
?
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Beg
your
pardon
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
does
he
sleep
?
 
<EOS>
What
's
his
number
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
what
I
mean
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
said
the
waiter
,
with
an
apologetic
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Copperfield
is
at
present
in
forty
-
four
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
,
"
retorted
Steerforth
,
"
by
putting
Mr
Copperfield
into
a
little
loft
over
a
stable
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
see
we
was
n't
aware
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
waiter
,
still
apologetically
,
"
as
Mr
Copperfield
was
anyways
particular
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
give
Mr
Copperfield
seventy
-
two
,
sir
,
if
it
would
be
preferred
.
<EOS>
Next
you
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
would
be
preferred
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
do
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
waiter
immediately
withdrew
to
make
the
exchange
.
 
<EOS>
Steerforth
,
very
much
amused
at
my
having
been
put
into
forty
-
four
,
laughed
again
,
and
clapped
me
on
the
shoulder
again
,
and
invited
me
to
breakfast
with
him
next
morning
at
ten
o'clock
---
an
invitation
I
was
only
too
proud
and
happy
to
accept
.
 
<EOS>
It
being
now
pretty
late
,
we
took
our
candles
and
went
upstairs
,
where
we
parted
with
friendly
heartiness
at
his
door
,
and
where
I
found
my
new
room
a
great
improvement
on
my
old
one
<EOS>
,
it
not
being
at
all
musty
,
and
having
an
immense
four
-
post
bedstead
in
it
,
which
was
quite
a
little
landed
estate
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
among
pillows
enough
for
six
,
I
soon
fell
asleep
in
a
blissful
condition
,
and
dreamed
of
ancient
Rome
,
Steerforth
,
and
friendship
,
until
the
early
morning
coaches
,
rumbling
out
of
the
archway
underneath
,
made
me
dream
of
thunder
and
the
gods
.

Chapter

.
<EOS>
Steerforth
's
home
 
<EOS>
When
the
chambermaid
tapped
at
my
door
at
eight
o'clock
,
and
informed
me
that
my
shaving
-
water
was
outside
,
I
felt
severely
the
having
no
occasion
for
it
,
and
blushed
in
my
bed
.
 
<EOS>
The
suspicion
that
she
laughed
too
,
when
she
said
it
,
preyed
upon
my
mind
all
the
time
I
was
dressing
;
and
gave
me
,
<EOS>
I
was
conscious
,
a
sneaking
and
guilty
air
when
I
passed
her
on
the
staircase
,
as
I
was
going
down
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
sensitively
aware
,
indeed
,
of
being
younger
than
I
could
have
wished
,
that
for
some
time
I
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
pass
her
at
all
,
under
the
ignoble
circumstances
of
the
case
;
but
,
hearing
her
there
with
a
broom
,
stood
peeping
out
of
window
at
King
Charles
on
horseback
,
surrounded
by
a
maze
of
hackney
-
coaches
,
and
looking
anything
but
regal
in
a
drizzling
rain
and
a
dark
-
brown
fog
,
until
I
was
admonished
by
the
waiter
that
the
gentleman
was
waiting
for
me
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
the
coffee
-
room
that
I
found
Steerforth
expecting
me
,
but
in
a
snug
private
apartment
,
red
-
curtained
and
Turkey
-
carpeted
,
where
the
fire
burnt
bright
,
and
a
fine
hot
breakfast
was
set
forth
on
a
table
covered
with
a
clean
cloth
;
and
a
cheerful
miniature
of
the
room
,
the
fire
,
the
breakfast
,
Steerforth
,
and
all
,
was
shining
in
the
little
round
mirror
over
the
sideboard
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
rather
bashful
at
first
,
Steerforth
being
so
self
-
possessed
,
and
elegant
,
and
superior
to
me
in
all
respects
<EOS>
(
age
included
)
;
but
his
easy
patronage
soon
put
that
to
rights
,
and
made
me
quite
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
enough
admire
the
change
he
had
wrought
in
the
Golden
Cross
;
or
compare
the
dull
forlorn
state
I
had
held
yesterday
,
with
this
morning
's
comfort
and
this
morning
's
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
waiter
's
familiarity
,
it
was
quenched
as
if
it
had
never
been
.
 
<EOS>
He
attended
on
us
,
as
I
may
say
,
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Copperfield
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
when
we
were
alone
,
"
I
should
like
to
hear
what
you
are
doing
,
and
where
you
are
going
,
and
all
about
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
you
were
my
property
.
"
<EOS>
Glowing
with
pleasure
to
find
that
he
had
still
this
interest
in
me
,
I
told
him
how
my
aunt
had
proposed
the
little
expedition
that
I
had
before
me
,
and
whither
it
tended
.
   
<EOS>
"
As
you
are
in
no
hurry
,
then
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
"
come
home
with
me
to
Highgate
,
and
stay
a
day
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
pleased
with
my
mother
---
she
is
a
little
vain
and
prosy
about
me
,
but
that
you
can
forgive
her
---
and
she
will
be
pleased
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
be
as
sure
of
that
,
as
you
are
kind
enough
to
say
you
are
,
"
I
answered
,
smiling
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Steerforth
,
"
everyone
who
likes
me
,
has
a
claim
on
her
that
is
sure
to
be
acknowledged
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
think
I
shall
be
a
favourite
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
and
prove
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
go
and
see
the
lions
for
an
hour
or
two
<EOS>
---
it
's
something
to
have
a
fresh
fellow
like
you
to
show
them
to
,
Copperfield
---
and
then
we
'll
journey
out
to
Highgate
by
the
coach
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
believe
but
that
I
was
in
a
dream
,
and
that
I
should
wake
presently
in
number
forty
-
four
,
to
the
solitary
box
in
the
coffee
-
room
and
the
familiar
waiter
again
.
 
<EOS>
After
I
had
written
to
my
aunt
and
told
her
of
my
fortunate
meeting
with
my
admired
old
schoolfellow
,
and
my
acceptance
of
his
invitation
,
we
went
out
in
a
hackney
-
chariot
,
and
saw
a
Panorama
and
some
other
sights
,
and
took
a
walk
through
the
Museum
,
where
I
could
not
help
observing
how
much
Steerforth
knew
,
on
an
infinite
variety
of
subjects
,
and
of
how
little
account
he
seemed
to
make
his
knowledge
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
take
a
high
degree
at
college
,
Steerforth
,
"
said
I
,
"
if
you
have
not
done
so
already
;
and
they
will
have
good
reason
to
be
proud
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
take
a
degree
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
I
!
<EOS>
my
dear
Daisy
---
will
you
mind
my
calling
you
Daisy
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
!
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
good
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Daisy
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
least
desire
or
intention
to
distinguish
myself
in
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
done
quite
sufficient
for
my
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
that
I
am
heavy
company
enough
for
myself
as
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
the
fame
---
"
I
was
beginning
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
romantic
Daisy
!
<EOS>
"
said
Steerforth
,
laughing
still
more
heartily
:
"
why
should
I
trouble
myself
,
that
a
parcel
of
heavy
-
headed
fellows
may
gape
and
hold
up
their
hands
?
 
<EOS>
Let
them
do
it
at
some
other
man
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
fame
for
him
,
and
he
's
welcome
to
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
abashed
at
having
made
so
great
a
mistake
,
and
was
glad
to
change
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
Fortunately
it
was
not
difficult
to
do
,
for
Steerforth
could
always
pass
from
one
subject
to
another
with
a
carelessness
and
lightness
that
were
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
Lunch
succeeded
to
our
sight
-
seeing
,
and
the
short
winter
day
wore
away
so
fast
,
that
it
was
dusk
when
the
stage
-
coach
stopped
with
us
at
an
old
brick
house
at
Highgate
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
An
elderly
lady
,
though
not
very
far
advanced
in
years
,
with
a
proud
carriage
and
a
handsome
face
,
was
in
the
doorway
as
we
alighted
;
and
greeting
Steerforth
as
"
My
dearest
James
,
"
folded
him
in
her
arms
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
lady
he
presented
me
as
his
mother
,
and
she
gave
me
a
stately
welcome
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
genteel
old
-
fashioned
house
,
very
quiet
and
orderly
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
windows
of
my
room
I
saw
all
London
lying
in
the
distance
like
a
great
vapour
,
with
here
<EOS>
and
there
some
lights
twinkling
through
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
only
time
,
in
dressing
,
to
glance
at
the
solid
furniture
,
the
framed
pieces
of
work
(
done
,
I
supposed
,
by
Steerforth
's
mother
when
she
was
a
girl
)
,
and
some
pictures
in
crayons
of
ladies
with
powdered
hair
and
bodices
,
coming
and
going
on
the
walls
,
as
the
newly
-
kindled
fire
crackled
and
sputtered
,
when
I
was
called
to
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
second
lady
in
the
dining
-
room
,
of
a
slight
short
figure
,
dark
,
and
not
agreeable
to
look
at
,
but
with
some
appearance
of
good
looks
too
,
who
attracted
my
attention
:
perhaps
because
I
had
not
expected
to
see
her
;
perhaps
because
I
found
myself
sitting
opposite
to
her
;
perhaps
because
of
something
really
remarkable
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
black
hair
and
eager
black
eyes
,
and
was
thin
,
and
had
a
scar
upon
her
lip
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
old
scar
<EOS>
---
I
should
rather
call
it
seam
,
for
it
was
not
discoloured
,
and
had
healed
years
ago
---
which
had
once
cut
through
her
mouth
,
downward
towards
the
chin
,
but
was
now
barely
visible
across
the
table
,
except
above
and
on
her
upper
lip
,
the
shape
of
which
it
had
altered
.
 
<EOS>
I
concluded
in
my
own
mind
that
she
was
about
thirty
years
of
age
,
and
that
she
wished
to
be
married
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
little
dilapidated
---
like
a
house
---
with
having
been
so
long
to
let
;
yet
had
,
as
I
have
said
,
an
appearance
of
good
looks
.
 
<EOS>
Her
thinness
seemed
to
be
the
effect
of
some
wasting
fire
within
her
,
which
found
a
vent
in
her
gaunt
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
introduced
as
Miss
Dartle
,
and
both
Steerforth
and
his
mother
called
her
Rosa
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
that
she
lived
there
,
and
had
been
for
a
long
time
Mrs
Steerforth
's
companion
.
 
<EOS>
It
appeared
to
me
that
she
never
said
anything
she
wanted
to
say
,
outright
;
but
hinted
it
,
and
made
a
great
deal
more
of
it
by
this
practice
.
 
<EOS>
For
example
,
when
Mrs
Steerforth
observed
,
more
in
jest
than
earnest
,
that
she
feared
her
son
led
but
a
wild
life
at
college
,
Miss
Dartle
put
in
thus
:
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
really
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
how
ignorant
I
am
,
and
that
I
only
ask
for
information
,
but
is
n't
it
always
so
?
 
<EOS>
I
thought
that
kind
of
life
was
on
all
hands
understood
to
be
---
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
education
for
a
very
grave
profession
,
if
you
mean
that
,
Rosa
,
"
Mrs
Steerforth
answered
with
some
coldness
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
very
true
,
"
returned
Miss
Dartle
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
is
n't
it
,
though
?
<EOS>
---
I
want
to
be
put
right
,
if
I
am
wrong
---
is
n't
it
,
really
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
what
?
"
said
Mrs
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
mean
it
's
not
!
"
returned
Miss
Dartle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'm
very
glad
to
hear
it
!
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
know
what
to
do
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
advantage
of
asking
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
allow
people
to
talk
before
me
about
wastefulness
and
profligacy
,
and
so
forth
,
in
connexion
with
that
life
,
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
be
right
,
"
said
Mrs
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
son
's
tutor
is
a
conscientious
gentleman
;
and
if
I
had
not
implicit
reliance
on
my
son
,
I
should
have
reliance
on
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Should
you
?
"
said
Miss
Dartle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
Conscientious
,
is
he
?
<EOS>
Really
conscientious
,
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
convinced
of
it
,
"
said
Mrs
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
very
nice
!
"
exclaimed
Miss
Dartle
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
comfort
!
 
<EOS>
Really
conscientious
?
 
<EOS>
Then
he
's
not
---
<EOS>
but
of
course
he
ca
n't
be
,
if
he
's
really
conscientious
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
shall
be
quite
happy
in
my
opinion
of
him
,
from
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
think
how
it
elevates
him
in
my
opinion
,
to
know
for
certain
that
he
's
really
conscientious
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
own
views
of
every
question
,
and
her
correction
of
everything
that
was
said
to
which
she
was
opposed
,
Miss
Dartle
insinuated
in
the
same
way
:
sometimes
,
I
could
not
conceal
from
myself
,
with
great
power
,
though
in
contradiction
even
of
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
An
instance
happened
before
dinner
was
done
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Steerforth
speaking
to
me
about
my
intention
of
going
down
into
Suffolk
<EOS>
,
I
said
at
hazard
how
glad
I
should
be
,
if
Steerforth
would
only
go
there
with
me
;
and
explaining
to
him
that
I
was
going
to
see
my
old
nurse
,
and
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
's
family
<EOS>
,
I
reminded
him
of
the
boatman
whom
he
had
seen
at
school
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
That
bluff
fellow
!
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
had
a
son
with
him
,
had
n't
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
his
nephew
,
"
I
replied
;
"
whom
he
adopted
,
though
,
as
a
son
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
very
pretty
little
niece
too
,
whom
he
adopted
as
a
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
his
house
---
or
rather
his
boat
,
for
he
lives
in
one
,
on
dry
land
---
is
full
of
people
who
are
objects
of
his
generosity
and
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
be
delighted
to
see
that
household
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Should
I
?
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
think
I
should
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
see
what
can
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
worth
a
journey
(
not
to
mention
the
pleasure
of
a
journey
with
you
,
Daisy
)
,
to
see
that
sort
of
people
together
,
and
to
make
one
of
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
heart
leaped
with
a
new
hope
of
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
in
reference
to
the
tone
in
which
he
had
spoken
of
"
that
sort
of
people
"
,
that
Miss
Dartle
,
whose
sparkling
eyes
had
been
watchful
of
us
,
now
broke
in
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
,
really
?
 
<EOS>
Do
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
Are
they
,
though
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
they
what
?
 
<EOS>
And
are
who
what
?
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
sort
of
people
.
 
<EOS>
---
Are
they
really
animals
and
clods
,
and
beings
of
another
order
?
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
SO
much
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
there
's
a
pretty
wide
separation
between
them
and
us
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
with
indifference
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
not
to
be
expected
to
be
as
sensitive
as
we
are
.
 
<EOS>
Their
delicacy
is
not
to
be
shocked
,
or
hurt
easily
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
wonderfully
virtuous
,
I
dare
say
---
some
people
contend
for
that
,
at
least
;
and
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
want
to
contradict
them
---
but
they
have
not
very
fine
natures
,
and
they
may
be
thankful
that
,
like
their
coarse
rough
skins
,
they
are
not
easily
wounded
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
!
"
said
Miss
Dartle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
,
now
,
when
I
have
been
better
pleased
than
to
hear
that
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
so
consoling
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
such
a
delight
to
know
that
,
when
they
suffer
,
they
do
n't
feel
!
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
have
been
quite
uneasy
for
that
sort
of
people
;
but
now
I
shall
just
dismiss
the
idea
of
them
,
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
Live
and
learn
.
<EOS>
I
had
my
doubts
,
I
confess
,
but
now
they
're
cleared
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
,
and
now
I
do
know
,
and
that
shows
the
advantage
of
asking
---
do
n't
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
believed
that
Steerforth
had
said
what
he
had
,
in
jest
,
or
to
draw
Miss
Dartle
out
;
and
I
expected
him
to
say
as
much
when
she
was
gone
,
and
we
two
were
sitting
before
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
merely
asked
me
what
I
thought
of
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
very
clever
,
is
she
not
?
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Clever
!
 
<EOS>
She
brings
everything
to
a
grindstone
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
"
and
sharpens
it
,
as
she
has
sharpened
her
own
face
and
figure
these
years
past
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
worn
herself
away
by
constant
sharpening
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
all
edge
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
remarkable
scar
that
is
upon
her
lip
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
Steerforth
's
face
fell
,
and
he
paused
a
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
fact
is
,
"
he
returned
,
"
I
did
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
an
unfortunate
accident
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
a
young
boy
,
and
she
exasperated
me
,
and
I
threw
a
hammer
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
A
promising
young
angel
<EOS>
I
must
have
been
!
<EOS>
"
I
was
deeply
sorry
to
have
touched
on
such
a
painful
theme
,
but
that
was
useless
now
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
has
borne
the
mark
ever
since
,
as
you
see
,
"
said
Steerforth
;
"
and
she
'll
bear
it
to
her
grave
,
if
she
ever
rests
in
one
---
though
I
can
hardly
believe
she
will
ever
rest
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
the
motherless
child
of
a
sort
of
cousin
of
my
father
's
.
 
<EOS>
He
died
one
day
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
,
who
was
then
a
widow
,
brought
her
here
to
be
company
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
a
couple
of
thousand
pounds
of
her
own
,
and
saves
the
interest
of
it
every
year
,
to
add
to
the
principal
.
<EOS>
There
's
the
history
of
Miss
Rosa
Dartle
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
have
no
doubt
she
loves
you
like
a
brother
?
"
said
I.
   
"
Humph
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Steerforth
,
looking
at
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
Some
brothers
are
not
loved
over
much
;
and
some
love
---
but
help
yourself
,
Copperfield
!
 
<EOS>
We
'll
drink
the
daisies
of
the
field
,
in
compliment
to
you
;
and
the
lilies
of
the
valley
that
toil
not
,
neither
do
they
spin
,
in
compliment
to
me
---
the
more
shame
for
me
!
"
<EOS>
A
moody
smile
that
had
overspread
his
features
cleared
off
as
he
said
this
merrily
,
and
he
was
his
own
frank
,
winning
self
again
.
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
glancing
at
the
scar
with
a
painful
interest
when
we
went
in
to
tea
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
long
before
I
observed
that
it
was
the
most
susceptible
part
of
her
face
,
and
that
,
when
she
turned
pale
,
that
mark
altered
first
,
and
became
a
dull
,
lead
-
coloured
streak
,
lengthening
out
to
its
full
extent
,
like
a
mark
in
invisible
ink
brought
to
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
altercation
between
her
and
Steerforth
about
a
cast
of
the
dice
at
back
gammon
---
when
I
thought
her
,
for
one
moment
,
in
a
storm
of
rage
;
and
then
I
saw
it
start
forth
like
the
old
writing
on
the
wall
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
no
matter
of
wonder
to
me
to
find
Mrs
Steerforth
devoted
to
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
be
able
to
speak
or
think
about
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
She
showed
me
his
picture
as
an
infant
,
in
a
locket
,
with
some
of
his
baby
-
hair
in
it
;
she
showed
me
his
picture
as
he
had
been
when
I
first
knew
him
;
and
she
wore
at
her
breast
his
picture
as
he
was
now
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
letters
he
had
ever
written
to
her
<EOS>
,
she
kept
in
a
cabinet
near
her
own
chair
by
the
fire
;
and
she
would
have
read
me
some
of
them
,
and
I
should
have
been
very
glad
to
hear
them
too
,
if
he
had
not
interposed
,
and
coaxed
her
out
of
the
design
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
at
Mr
Creakle
's
,
my
son
tells
me
,
that
you
first
became
acquainted
,
"
said
Mrs
Steerforth
,
as
she
and
I
were
talking
at
one
table
,
while
they
played
backgammon
at
another
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
I
recollect
his
speaking
,
at
that
time
,
of
a
pupil
younger
than
himself
who
had
taken
his
fancy
there
;
but
your
name
,
as
you
may
suppose
,
has
not
lived
in
my
memory
.
<EOS>

"
He
was
very
generous
and
noble
to
me
in
those
days
,
I
assure
you
,
ma'am
,
"
said
I
,
"
and
I
stood
in
need
of
such
a
friend
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
quite
crushed
without
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
always
generous
and
noble
,
"
said
Mrs
Steerforth
,
proudly
.
   
<EOS>
I
subscribed
to
this
with
all
my
heart
,
God
knows
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
I
did
;
for
the
stateliness
of
her
manner
already
abated
towards
me
,
except
when
she
spoke
in
praise
of
him
,
and
then
her
air
was
always
lofty
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
a
fit
school
generally
for
my
son
,
"
said
she
;
"
far
from
it
;
but
there
were
particular
circumstances
to
be
considered
at
the
time
,
of
more
importance
even
than
that
selection
.
 
<EOS>
My
son
's
high
spirit
made
it
desirable
that
he
should
be
placed
with
some
man
who
felt
its
superiority
,
and
would
be
content
to
bow
himself
before
it
;
and
we
found
such
a
man
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
knew
that
,
knowing
the
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
I
did
not
despise
him
the
more
for
it
,
but
thought
it
a
redeeming
quality
in
him
if
he
could
be
allowed
any
grace
for
not
resisting
one
so
irresistible
as
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
son
's
great
capacity
was
tempted
on
,
there
,
by
a
feeling
of
voluntary
emulation
and
conscious
pride
,
"
the
fond
lady
went
on
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
would
have
risen
against
all
constraint
;
but
he
found
himself
the
monarch
of
the
place
,
and
he
haughtily
determined
to
be
worthy
of
his
station
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
like
himself
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
echoed
,
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
,
that
it
was
like
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
my
son
took
,
of
his
own
will
,
and
on
no
compulsion
,
to
the
course
in
which
he
can
always
,
when
it
is
his
pleasure
,
outstrip
every
competitor
,
"
she
pursued
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
son
informs
me
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
that
you
were
quite
devoted
to
him
,
and
that
when
you
met
yesterday
you
made
yourself
known
to
him
with
tears
of
joy
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
an
affected
woman
if
I
made
any
pretence
of
being
surprised
by
my
son
's
inspiring
such
emotions
;
but
I
can
not
be
indifferent
to
anyone
who
is
so
sensible
of
his
merit
,
and
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
here
,
and
can
assure
you
that
he
feels
an
unusual
friendship
for
you
,
and
that
you
may
rely
on
his
protection
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Dartle
played
backgammon
as
eagerly
as
she
did
everything
else
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
seen
her
,
first
,
at
the
board
,
I
should
have
fancied
that
her
figure
had
got
thin
,
and
her
eyes
had
got
large
,
over
that
pursuit
,
and
no
other
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
very
much
mistaken
if
she
missed
a
word
of
this
,
or
lost
a
look
of
mine
as
I
received
it
with
the
utmost
pleasure
,
and
honoured
by
Mrs
Steerforth
's
confidence
,
felt
older
than
I
had
done
since
I
left
Canterbury
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
evening
was
pretty
far
spent
,
and
a
tray
of
glasses
and
decanters
came
in
,
<EOS>
Steerforth
promised
,
over
the
fire
,
that
he
would
seriously
think
of
going
down
into
the
country
with
me
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
hurry
,
he
said
;
a
week
hence
would
do
;
and
his
mother
hospitably
said
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
While
we
were
talking
,
he
more
than
once
called
me
Daisy
;
which
brought
Miss
Dartle
out
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
really
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
she
asked
,
"
is
it
a
nickname
?
 
<EOS>
And
why
does
he
give
it
you
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
---
eh
?
---
because
he
thinks
you
young
and
innocent
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
stupid
in
these
things
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
coloured
in
replying
that
I
believed
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Miss
Dartle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
I
am
glad
to
know
that
!
 
<EOS>
I
ask
for
information
,
and
I
am
glad
to
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
thinks
you
young
and
innocent
;
and
so
you
are
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
that
's
quite
delightful
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
went
to
bed
soon
after
this
,
and
Mrs
Steerforth
retired
too
.
<EOS>
Steerforth
and
I
,
after
lingering
for
half
-
an
-
hour
over
the
fire
,
talking
about
Traddles
and
all
the
rest
of
them
at
old
Salem
House
,
went
upstairs
together
.
 
<EOS>
Steerforth
's
room
was
next
to
mine
,
and
I
went
in
to
look
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
picture
of
comfort
,
full
of
easy
-
chairs
,
cushions
and
footstools
,
worked
by
his
mother
's
hand
,
and
with
no
sort
of
thing
omitted
that
could
help
to
render
it
complete
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
her
handsome
features
looked
down
on
her
darling
from
a
portrait
on
the
wall
,
as
if
it
were
even
something
to
her
that
her
likeness
should
watch
him
while
he
slept
.
   
<EOS>
I
found
the
fire
burning
clear
enough
in
my
room
by
this
time
,
and
the
curtains
drawn
before
the
windows
and
round
the
bed
,
giving
it
a
very
snug
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
down
in
a
great
chair
upon
the
hearth
to
meditate
on
my
happiness
;
and
had
enjoyed
the
contemplation
of
it
for
some
time
,
when
I
found
a
likeness
of
Miss
Dartle
looking
eagerly
at
me
from
above
the
chimney
-
piece
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
startling
likeness
,
and
necessarily
had
a
startling
look
.
<EOS>
The
painter
had
n't
made
the
scar
,
but
I
made
it
;
and
there
it
was
,
coming
and
going
;
now
confined
to
the
upper
lip
as
I
had
seen
it
at
dinner
,
and
now
showing
the
whole
extent
of
the
wound
inflicted
by
the
hammer
,
as
I
had
seen
it
when
she
was
passionate
.
   
<EOS>
I
wondered
peevishly
why
they
could
n't
put
her
anywhere
else
instead
of
quartering
her
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
To
get
rid
of
her
,
I
undressed
quickly
,
extinguished
my
light
,
and
went
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
fell
asleep
,
I
could
not
forget
that
she
was
still
there
looking
,
"
Is
it
really
,
though
?
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
"
;
and
when
I
awoke
in
the
night
,
I
found
that
I
was
uneasily
asking
all
sorts
of
people
in
my
dreams
whether
it
really
was
or
not
---
without
knowing
what
I
meant
.
      
<EOS>
Chapter
21
.
<EOS>
Little
Em'ly
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
servant
in
that
house
,
a
man
who
,
I
understood
,
was
usually
with
Steerforth
,
and
had
come
into
his
service
at
the
University
,
who
was
in
appearance
a
pattern
of
respectability
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
there
never
existed
in
his
station
a
more
respectable
-
looking
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
taciturn
,
soft
-
footed
,
very
quiet
in
his
manner
,
deferential
,
observant
,
always
at
hand
when
wanted
,
and
never
near
when
not
wanted
;
but
his
great
claim
to
consideration
was
his
respectability
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
a
pliant
face
,
he
had
rather
a
stiff
neck
,
rather
a
tight
smooth
head
with
short
hair
clinging
to
it
at
the
sides
,
a
soft
way
of
speaking
,
with
a
peculiar
habit
of
whispering
the
letter
<EOS>
S^
<EOS>
so
distinctly
,
that
he
seemed
to
use
it
oftener
than
any
other
man
;
but
every
peculiarity
that
he
had
he
made
respectable
.
 
<EOS>
If
his
nose
had
been
upside
-
down
,
he
would
have
made
that
respectable
.
 
<EOS>
He
surrounded
himself
with
an
atmosphere
of
respectability
,
and
walked
secure
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
next
to
impossible
to
suspect
him
of
anything
wrong
,
he
was
so
thoroughly
respectable
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
could
have
thought
of
putting
him
in
a
livery
,
he
was
so
highly
respectable
.
 
<EOS>
To
have
imposed
any
derogatory
work
upon
him
,
would
have
been
to
inflict
a
wanton
insult
on
the
feelings
of
a
most
respectable
man
.
 
<EOS>
And
of
this
,
I
noticed
---
<EOS>
the
women
-
servants
in
the
household
were
so
intuitively
conscious
,
that
they
always
did
such
work
themselves
,
and
generally
while
he
read
the
paper
by
the
pantry
fire
.
   
<EOS>
Such
a
self
-
contained
man
I
never
saw
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
that
quality
,
as
in
every
other
he
possessed
,
he
only
seemed
to
be
the
more
respectable
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
fact
that
no
one
knew
his
Christian
name
,
seemed
to
form
a
part
of
his
respectability
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
objected
against
his
surname
,
Littimer
,
by
which
he
was
known
.
<EOS>
Peter
might
have
been
hanged
,
or
Tom
transported
;
but
Littimer
was
perfectly
respectable
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
occasioned
,
I
suppose
,
by
the
reverend
nature
of
respectability
in
the
abstract
,
but
I
felt
particularly
young
in
this
man
's
presence
.
 
<EOS>
How
old
he
was
himself
,
I
could
not
guess
---
and
that
again
went
to
his
credit
on
the
same
score
;
for
in
the
calmness
of
respectability
he
might
have
numbered
fifty
years
as
well
as
thirty
.
   
<EOS>
Littimer
was
in
my
room
in
the
morning
before
I
was
up
,
to
bring
me
that
reproachful
shaving
-
water
,
and
to
put
out
my
clothes
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
undrew
the
curtains
and
looked
out
of
bed
,
I
saw
him
,
in
an
equable
temperature
of
respectability
,
unaffected
by
the
east
wind
of
January
,
and
not
even
breathing
frostily
,
standing
my
boots
right
and
left
in
the
first
dancing
position
,
and
blowing
specks
of
dust
off
my
coat
as
he
laid
it
down
like
a
baby
.
   
<EOS>
I
gave
him
good
morning
,
and
asked
him
what
o'clock
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
out
of
his
pocket
the
most
respectable
hunting
-
watch
I
ever
saw
,
and
preventing
the
spring
with
his
thumb
from
opening
far
,
looked
in
at
the
face
as
if
he
were
consulting
an
oracular
oyster
,
shut
it
up
again
,
and
said
,
if
I
pleased
,
it
was
half
past
eight
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Steerforth
will
be
glad
to
hear
how
you
have
rested
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
I
,
"
very
well
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Is
Mr
Steerforth
quite
well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
Mr
Steerforth
is
tolerably
well
.
"
 
<EOS>
Another
of
his
characteristics
---
no
use
of
superlatives
.
 
<EOS>
A
cool
calm
medium
always
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anything
more
I
can
have
the
honour
of
doing
for
you
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
The
warning
-
bell
will
ring
at
nine
;
the
family
take
breakfast
at
half
past
nine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
I
thank
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thank
YOU
,
sir
,
if
you
please
"
;
and
with
that
,
and
with
a
little
inclination
of
his
head
when
he
passed
the
bed
-
side
,
as
an
apology
for
correcting
me
,
he
went
out
,
shutting
the
door
as
delicately
as
if
I
had
just
fallen
into
a
sweet
sleep
on
which
my
life
depended
.
   
<EOS>
Every
morning
we
held
exactly
this
conversation
:
never
any
more
,
and
never
any
less
:
and
yet
,
invariably
,
however
far
I
might
have
been
lifted
out
of
myself
over
-
night
,
and
advanced
towards
maturer
years
,
by
Steerforth
's
companionship
,
or
Mrs
Steerforth
's
confidence
,
or
Miss
Dartle
's
conversation
,
in
the
presence
of
this
most
respectable
man
I
became
,
as
our
smaller
poets
sing
,
"
a
boy
again
"
.
   
<EOS>
He
got
horses
for
us
;
and
Steerforth
,
who
knew
everything
,
gave
me
lessons
in
riding
.
 
<EOS>
He
provided
foils
for
us
,
and
Steerforth
gave
me
lessons
in
fencing
---
gloves
,
and
I
began
,
of
the
same
master
,
to
improve
in
boxing
.
 
<EOS>
It
gave
me
no
manner
of
concern
that
Steerforth
should
find
me
a
novice
in
these
sciences
,
but
I
never
could
bear
to
show
my
want
of
skill
before
the
respectable
Littimer
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
Littimer
understood
such
arts
himself
;
he
never
led
me
to
suppose
anything
of
the
kind
,
by
so
much
as
the
vibration
of
one
of
his
respectable
eyelashes
;
yet
whenever
he
was
by
,
while
we
were
practising
<EOS>
,
I
felt
myself
the
greenest
and
most
inexperienced
of
mortals
.
   
<EOS>
I
am
particular
about
this
man
,
because
he
made
a
particular
effect
on
me
at
that
time
,
and
because
of
what
took
place
thereafter
.
   
<EOS>
The
week
passed
away
in
a
most
delightful
manner
.
 
<EOS>
It
passed
rapidly
,
as
may
be
supposed
,
to
one
entranced
as
I
was
;
and
yet
it
gave
me
so
many
occasions
for
knowing
Steerforth
better
,
and
admiring
him
more
in
a
thousand
respects
,
that
at
its
close
I
seemed
to
have
been
with
him
for
a
much
longer
time
.
 
<EOS>
A
dashing
way
he
had
of
treating
me
like
a
plaything
,
was
more
agreeable
to
me
than
any
behaviour
he
could
have
adopted
.
 
<EOS>
It
reminded
me
of
our
old
acquaintance
;
it
seemed
the
natural
sequel
of
it
;
it
showed
me
that
he
was
unchanged
;
it
relieved
me
of
any
uneasiness
I
might
have
felt
,
in
comparing
my
merits
with
his
,
and
measuring
my
claims
upon
his
friendship
by
any
equal
standard
;
above
all
,
it
was
a
familiar
,
unrestrained
,
affectionate
demeanour
that
he
used
towards
no
one
else
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
had
treated
me
at
school
differently
from
all
the
rest
,
I
joyfully
believed
that
he
treated
me
in
life
unlike
any
other
friend
he
had
.
 
<EOS>
I
believed
that
I
was
nearer
to
his
heart
than
any
other
friend
,
and
my
own
heart
warmed
with
attachment
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
made
up
his
mind
to
go
with
me
into
the
country
,
and
the
day
arrived
for
our
departure
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
doubtful
at
first
whether
to
take
Littimer
or
not
,
but
decided
to
leave
him
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
The
respectable
creature
,
satisfied
with
his
lot
whatever
it
was
,
arranged
our
portmanteaux
on
the
little
carriage
that
was
to
take
us
into
London
,
as
if
they
were
intended
to
defy
the
shocks
of
ages
,
and
received
my
modestly
proffered
donation
with
perfect
tranquillity
.
   
<EOS>
We
bade
adieu
to
Mrs
Steerforth
and
Miss
Dartle
,
with
many
thanks
on
my
part
,
and
much
kindness
on
the
devoted
mother
's
.
 
<EOS>
The
last
thing
I
saw
was
Littimer
's
unruffled
eye
;
fraught
,
as
I
fancied
,
with
the
silent
conviction
that
I
was
very
young
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
What
I
felt
,
in
returning
so
auspiciously
to
the
old
familiar
places
,
I
shall
not
endeavour
to
describe
.
 
<EOS>
We
went
down
by
the
Mail
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
concerned
<EOS>
,
I
recollect
,
even
for
the
honour
of
Yarmouth
,
that
when
Steerforth
said
,
as
we
drove
through
its
dark
streets
to
the
inn
,
that
,
as
well
as
he
could
make
out
,
it
was
a
good
,
queer
,
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
kind
of
hole
,
I
was
highly
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
We
went
to
bed
on
our
arrival
<EOS>
(
I
observed
a
pair
of
dirty
shoes
and
gaiters
in
connexion
with
my
old
friend
the
Dolphin
as
we
passed
that
door
)
,
and
breakfasted
late
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Steerforth
,
who
was
in
great
spirits
,
had
been
strolling
about
the
beach
before
I
was
up
,
and
had
made
acquaintance
,
he
said
,
with
half
the
boatmen
in
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
Moreover
,
he
had
seen
,
in
the
distance
,
what
he
was
sure
must
be
the
identical
house
of
Mr
Peggotty
,
with
smoke
coming
out
of
the
chimney
;
and
had
had
a
great
mind
,
he
told
me
,
to
walk
in
and
swear
he
was
myself
grown
out
of
knowledge
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
do
you
propose
to
introduce
me
there
,
Daisy
?
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
at
your
disposal
.
 
<EOS>
Make
your
own
arrangements
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
was
thinking
that
this
evening
would
be
a
good
time
,
Steerforth
,
when
they
are
all
sitting
round
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
you
to
see
it
<EOS>
when
it
's
snug
,
it
's
such
a
curious
place
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
be
it
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
evening
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
give
them
any
notice
that
we
are
here
,
you
know
,
"
said
I
,
delighted
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
take
them
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
of
course
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
no
fun
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
"
unless
we
take
them
by
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
see
the
natives
in
their
aboriginal
condition
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Though
they
ARE
that
sort
of
people
that
you
mentioned
,
"
I
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Aha
!
 
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
you
recollect
my
skirmishes
with
Rosa
,
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
with
a
quick
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
Confound
the
girl
,
I
am
half
afraid
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
like
a
goblin
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
never
mind
her
.
 
<EOS>
Now
what
are
you
going
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
going
to
see
your
nurse
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
must
see
Peggotty
first
of
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
replied
Steerforth
,
looking
at
his
watch
.
 
<EOS>
"
Suppose
I
deliver
you
up
to
be
cried
over
for
a
couple
of
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Is
that
long
enough
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
answered
,
laughing
,
that
I
thought
we
might
get
through
it
in
that
time
,
but
that
he
must
come
also
;
for
he
would
find
that
his
renown
had
preceded
him
,
and
that
he
was
almost
as
great
a
personage
as
I
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
come
anywhere
you
like
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
"
or
do
anything
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
where
to
come
to
;
and
in
two
hours
I
'll
produce
myself
in
any
state
you
please
,
sentimental
or
comical
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
gave
him
minute
directions
for
finding
the
residence
of
Mr
Barkis
,
carrier
to
Blunderstone
and
elsewhere
;
and
,
on
this
understanding
,
went
out
alone
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
sharp
bracing
air
;
the
ground
was
dry
;
the
sea
was
crisp
and
clear
;
the
sun
was
diffusing
abundance
of
light
,
if
not
much
warmth
;
and
everything
was
fresh
and
lively
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
fresh
and
lively
myself
,
in
the
pleasure
of
being
there
,
that
I
could
have
stopped
the
people
in
the
streets
and
shaken
hands
with
them
.
   
<EOS>
The
streets
looked
small
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
The
streets
that
we
have
only
seen
as
children
always
do
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
when
we
go
back
to
them
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
forgotten
nothing
in
them
,
and
found
nothing
changed
,
until
I
came
to
Mr
Omer
's
shop
.
 
<EOS>
OMER
AND
Joram
was
now
written
up
,
where
OMER
used
to
be
;
but
the
inscription
,
DRAPER
,
TAILOR
,
HABERDASHER
,
FUNERAL
FURNISHER
,
&
c
,
remained
as
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
My
footsteps
seemed
to
tend
so
naturally
to
the
shop
door
,
after
I
had
read
these
words
from
over
the
way
<EOS>
,
that
I
went
across
the
road
and
looked
in
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
pretty
woman
at
the
back
of
the
shop
,
dancing
a
little
child
in
her
arms
,
while
another
little
fellow
clung
to
her
apron
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
either
Minnie
or
Minnie
's
children
.
 
<EOS>
The
glass
door
of
the
parlour
was
not
open
;
but
in
the
workshop
across
the
yard
I
could
faintly
hear
the
old
tune
playing
,
as
if
it
had
never
left
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr
Omer
at
home
?
"
<EOS>
said
I
,
entering
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
see
him
,
for
a
moment
,
if
he
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
sir
,
he
is
at
home
,
"
said
Minnie
;
"
the
weather
do
n't
suit
his
asthma
out
of
doors
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
,
call
your
grandfather
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
little
fellow
,
who
was
holding
her
apron
,
gave
such
a
lusty
shout
,
that
the
sound
of
it
made
him
bashful
,
and
he
buried
his
face
in
her
skirts
,
to
her
great
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
a
heavy
puffing
and
blowing
coming
towards
us
,
and
soon
Mr
Omer
,
shorter
-
winded
than
of
yore
,
but
not
much
older
-
looking
,
stood
before
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Servant
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
can
I
do
for
you
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
shake
hands
with
me
,
Mr
Omer
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
I
,
putting
out
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
were
very
good
-
natured
to
me
once
,
when
I
am
afraid
I
did
n't
show
that
I
thought
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Was
I
though
?
"
<EOS>
returned
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
to
hear
it
,
but
I
do
n't
remember
when
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
it
was
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
my
memory
has
got
as
short
as
my
breath
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
looking
at
me
and
shaking
his
head
;
"
for
I
do
n't
remember
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
remember
your
coming
to
the
coach
to
meet
me
,
and
my
having
breakfast
here
,
and
our
riding
out
to
Blunderstone
together
:
you
,
and
I
,
and
Mrs
Joram
,
and
Mr
Joram
too
---
who
was
n't
her
husband
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Lord
bless
my
soul
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mr
Omer
,
after
being
thrown
by
his
surprise
into
a
fit
of
coughing
,
"
you
do
n't
say
so
!
 
<EOS>
Minnie
,
my
dear
,
you
recollect
?
 
<EOS>
Dear
me
,
yes
;
the
party
was
a
lady
,
I
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
mother
,
"
I
rejoined
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
---
be
---
sure
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
touching
my
waistcoat
with
his
forefinger
,
"
and
there
was
a
little
child
too
!
 
<EOS>
There
was
two
parties
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
party
was
laid
along
with
the
other
party
.
<EOS>
Over
at
Blunderstone
it
was
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
And
how
have
you
been
since
?
"
   
<EOS>
Very
well
,
I
thanked
him
,
as
I
hoped
he
had
been
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
nothing
to
grumble
at
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
find
my
breath
gets
short
,
but
it
seldom
gets
longer
as
a
man
gets
older
.
<EOS>
I
take
it
as
it
comes
,
and
make
the
most
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
best
way
,
ai
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Omer
coughed
again
,
in
consequence
of
laughing
,
and
was
assisted
out
of
his
fit
by
his
daughter
,
who
now
stood
close
beside
us
,
dancing
her
smallest
child
on
the
counter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
Two
parties
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
in
that
very
ride
,
if
you
'll
believe
me
,
the
day
was
named
for
my
Minnie
to
marry
Joram
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
name
it
,
sir
,
"
says
Joram
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
do
,
father
,
"
says
Minnie
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
he
's
come
into
the
business
.
 
<EOS>
And
look
here
!
 
<EOS>
The
youngest
!
"
   
<EOS>
Minnie
laughed
,
and
stroked
her
banded
hair
upon
her
temples
,
as
her
father
put
one
of
his
fat
fingers
into
the
hand
of
the
child
<EOS>
she
was
dancing
on
the
counter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Two
parties
,
of
course
!
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
nodding
his
head
retrospectively
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ex
-
actly
so
!
 
<EOS>
And
Joram
's
at
work
,
at
this
minute
,
on
a
grey
one
with
silver
nails
,
not
this
measurement
"
---
the
measurement
of
the
dancing
child
upon
the
counter
---
"
by
a
good
two
inches
.
 
<EOS>
---
Will
you
take
something
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
thanked
him
,
but
declined
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Barkis
's
the
carrier
's
wife
---
<EOS>
Peggotty
's
the
boatman
's
sister
---
she
had
something
to
do
with
your
family
?
 
<EOS>
She
was
in
service
there
,
sure
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
My
answering
in
the
affirmative
gave
him
great
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
my
breath
will
get
long
next
,
my
memory
's
getting
so
much
so
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
we
've
got
a
young
relation
of
hers
here
,
under
articles
to
us
,
that
has
as
elegant
a
taste
in
the
dress
-
making
business
<EOS>
---
I
assure
you
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
there
's
a
Duchess
in
England
can
touch
her
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
little
Em'ly
?
"
said
I
,
involuntarily
.
   
<EOS>
"
Em'ly
's
her
name
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
"
and
she
's
little
too
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
you
'll
believe
me
,
she
has
such
a
face
of
her
own
that
half
the
women
in
this
town
are
mad
against
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
father
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Minnie
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
"
I
do
n't
say
it
's
the
case
with
you
,
"
winking
at
me
,
"
but
<EOS>
I
say
that
half
the
women
in
Yarmouth
---
ah
!
<EOS>
and
in
five
mile
round
---
are
mad
against
that
girl
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
she
should
have
kept
to
her
own
station
in
life
,
father
,
"
said
Minnie
,
"
and
not
have
given
them
any
hold
to
talk
about
her
,
and
then
they
could
n't
have
done
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Could
n't
have
done
it
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Could
n't
have
done
it
!
 
<EOS>
Is
that
YOUR
knowledge
of
life
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
there
that
any
woman
could
n't
do
,
that
she
should
n't
do
---
especially
on
the
subject
of
another
woman
's
good
looks
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
really
thought
it
was
all
over
with
Mr
Omer
,
after
he
had
uttered
this
libellous
pleasantry
.
 
<EOS>
He
coughed
to
that
extent
,
and
his
breath
eluded
all
his
attempts
to
recover
it
with
that
obstinacy
,
that
I
fully
expected
to
see
his
head
go
down
behind
the
counter
,
and
his
little
black
breeches
,
with
the
rusty
little
bunches
of
ribbons
at
the
knees
,
come
quivering
up
in
a
last
ineffectual
struggle
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
he
got
better
,
though
he
still
panted
hard
,
and
was
so
exhausted
that
he
was
obliged
to
sit
on
the
stool
of
the
shop
-
desk
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
he
said
,
wiping
his
head
,
and
breathing
with
difficulty
,
"
she
has
n't
taken
much
to
any
companions
here
;
she
has
n't
taken
kindly
to
any
particular
acquaintances
and
friends
,
not
to
mention
sweethearts
.
 
<EOS>
In
consequence
,
an
ill
-
natured
story
got
about
,
that
Em'ly
wanted
to
be
a
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Now
my
opinion
is
,
that
it
came
into
circulation
principally
on
account
of
her
sometimes
saying
,
at
the
school
,
that
if
she
was
a
lady
she
would
like
to
do
so
-
and
-
so
for
her
uncle
---
<EOS>
do
n't
you
see
?
---
and
buy
him
such
-
and
-
such
fine
things
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
Mr
Omer
,
she
has
said
so
to
me
,
"
I
returned
eagerly
,
"
when
we
were
both
children
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Omer
nodded
his
head
and
rubbed
his
chin
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
so
.
 
<EOS>
Then
out
of
a
very
little
,
she
could
dress
herself
,
you
see
,
better
than
most
others
<EOS>
could
out
of
a
deal
,
and
that
made
things
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
she
was
rather
what
might
be
called
wayward
---
I
'll
go
so
far
as
to
say
what
I
should
call
wayward
myself
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
;
"
---
did
n't
know
her
own
mind
quite
---
a
little
spoiled
---
and
could
n't
,
at
first
,
exactly
bind
herself
down
.
 
<EOS>
No
more
than
that
was
ever
said
against
her
,
Minnie
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
father
,
"
said
Mrs
Joram
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
worst
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
when
she
got
a
situation
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
"
to
keep
a
fractious
old
lady
company
,
they
did
n't
very
well
agree
,
and
she
did
n't
stop
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
came
here
,
apprenticed
for
three
years
.
 
<EOS>
Nearly
two
of
'em
are
over
,
and
she
has
been
as
good
a
girl
as
ever
was
.
 
<EOS>
Worth
any
six
!
 
<EOS>
Minnie
,
is
she
worth
any
six
,
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
father
,
"
replied
Minnie
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
say
I
detracted
from
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
young
gentleman
<EOS>
,
"
he
added
,
after
a
few
moments
'
further
rubbing
of
his
chin
,
"
that
you
may
not
consider
me
long
-
winded
as
well
as
short
-
breathed
,
I
believe
that
's
all
about
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
they
had
spoken
in
a
subdued
tone
,
while
speaking
of
Em'ly
,
I
had
no
doubt
that
she
was
near
.
 
<EOS>
On
my
asking
now
,
if
that
were
not
so
,
Mr
Omer
nodded
yes
,
and
nodded
towards
the
door
of
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
My
hurried
inquiry
if
I
might
peep
in
,
was
answered
with
a
free
permission
;
and
,
looking
through
the
glass
,
I
saw
her
sitting
at
her
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
her
,
a
most
beautiful
little
creature
,
with
the
cloudless
blue
eyes
,
that
had
looked
into
my
childish
heart
,
turned
laughingly
upon
another
child
of
Minnie
's
who
was
playing
near
her
;
with
enough
of
wilfulness
in
her
bright
face
to
justify
what
I
had
heard
;
with
much
of
the
old
capricious
coyness
lurking
in
it
;
but
with
nothing
in
her
pretty
looks
,
I
am
sure
,
but
what
was
meant
for
goodness
and
for
happiness
,
and
what
was
on
a
good
and
   
happy
course
.
   
<EOS>
The
tune
across
the
yard
that
seemed
as
if
it
never
had
left
off
---
alas
!
<EOS>
it
was
the
tune
that
never
DOES
leave
off
---
was
beating
,
softly
,
all
the
while
.
   
<EOS>
"
Would
n't
you
like
to
step
in
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
"
and
speak
to
her
?
<EOS>
Walk
in
and
speak
to
her
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
Make
yourself
at
home
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
too
bashful
to
do
<EOS>
so
then
---
I
was
afraid
of
confusing
her
,
and
I
was
no
less
afraid
of
confusing
myself
.
<EOS>
---
but
I
informed
myself
of
the
hour
at
which
she
left
of
an
evening
,
in
order
that
our
visit
might
be
timed
accordingly
;
and
taking
leave
of
Mr
Omer
,
and
his
pretty
daughter
,
and
her
little
children
,
went
away
to
my
dear
old
Peggotty
's
.
   
<EOS>
Here
she
was
,
in
the
tiled
kitchen
,
cooking
dinner
!
 
<EOS>
The
moment
I
knocked
at
the
door
she
opened
it
,
and
asked
me
what
I
pleased
to
want
.
 
<EOS>
I
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
,
but
she
gave
me
no
smile
in
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
never
ceased
to
write
to
her
,
but
it
must
have
been
seven
years
since
we
had
met
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr
Barkis
at
home
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
feigning
to
speak
roughly
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
at
home
,
sir
,
"
returned
Peggotty
,
"
but
he
's
bad
abed
with
the
rheumatics
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
he
go
over
to
Blunderstone
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
he
's
well
he
do
,
"
she
answered
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
YOU
ever
go
there
,
Mrs
Barkis
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
looked
at
me
more
attentively
,
and
I
noticed
a
quick
movement
of
her
hands
towards
each
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Because
I
want
to
ask
a
question
about
a
house
there
,
that
they
call
the
<EOS>
---
what
is
it
?
<EOS>
---
the
Rookery
,
"
said
<EOS>
I.
   
She
took
a
step
backward
,
and
put
out
her
hands
in
an
undecided
frightened
way
,
as
if
to
keep
me
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
Peggotty
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
She
cried
,
"
My
darling
boy
!
"
<EOS>
and
we
both
burst
into
tears
,
and
were
locked
in
one
another
's
arms
.
   
<EOS>
What
extravagances
she
committed
;
what
laughing
and
crying
over
me
;
what
pride
she
showed
,
what
joy
,
what
sorrow
that
she
whose
pride
and
joy
<EOS>
I
might
have
been
,
could
never
hold
me
in
a
fond
embrace
;
I
have
not
the
heart
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
troubled
with
no
misgiving
that
it
was
young
in
me
to
respond
to
her
emotions
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
never
laughed
and
cried
in
all
my
life
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
---
not
even
to
her
---
more
freely
than
I
did
that
morning
.
   
<EOS>
"
Barkis
will
be
so
glad
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
wiping
her
eyes
with
her
apron
,
"
that
it
'll
do
him
more
good
than
pints
of
liniment
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
go
and
tell
him
you
are
here
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
come
up
and
see
him
,
my
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
Of
course
I
would
.
 
<EOS>
But
Peggotty
could
not
get
out
of
the
room
as
easily
as
she
meant
to
,
for
as
often
as
she
got
to
the
door
and
looked
round
at
me
<EOS>
,
she
came
back
again
to
have
another
laugh
and
another
cry
upon
my
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
to
make
the
matter
easier
,
I
went
upstairs
with
her
;
and
having
waited
outside
for
a
minute
,
while
she
said
a
word
of
preparation
to
Mr
Barkis
,
presented
myself
before
that
invalid
.
   
<EOS>
He
received
me
with
absolute
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
too
rheumatic
to
be
shaken
hands
with
,
but
he
begged
me
to
shake
the
tassel
on
the
top
of
his
nightcap
,
which
I
did
most
cordially
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
sat
down
by
the
side
of
the
bed
,
he
said
that
it
did
him
a
world
of
good
to
feel
as
if
he
was
driving
me
on
the
Blunderstone
road
again
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
lay
in
bed
,
face
upward
,
and
so
covered
,
with
that
exception
,
that
he
seemed
to
be
nothing
but
a
face
---
like
a
conventional
cherubim
<EOS>
---
he
looked
the
queerest
object
I
ever
beheld
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
name
was
it
,
as
I
wrote
up
in
the
cart
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Barkis
,
with
a
slow
rheumatic
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
,
we
had
some
grave
talks
about
that
matter
,
had
n't
we
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
willin
'
a
long
time
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Barkis
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
long
time
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
regret
it
,
"
said
Mr
Barkis
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remember
what
you
told
me
once
,
about
her
making
all
the
apple
parsties
and
doing
all
the
cooking
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
very
well
,
"
I
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
as
true
,
"
said
Mr
Barkis
,
"
as
turnips
is
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
as
true
,
"
said
Mr
Barkis
,
nodding
his
nightcap
,
which
was
his
only
means
of
emphasis
,
"
as
taxes
is
.
 
<EOS>
And
nothing
's
truer
than
them
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
turned
his
eyes
upon
me
,
as
if
for
my
assent
to
this
result
of
his
reflections
in
bed
;
and
I
gave
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
's
truer
than
them
,
"
repeated
Mr
Barkis
;
"
a
man
as
poor
as
I
am
,
finds
that
out
in
his
mind
when
he
's
laid
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
very
poor
man
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
hear
it
,
Mr
Barkis
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
very
poor
man
,
indeed
I
am
,
"
said
Mr
Barkis
.
   
<EOS>
Here
his
right
hand
came
slowly
and
feebly
from
under
the
bedclothes
,
and
with
a
purposeless
uncertain
grasp
took
hold
of
a
stick
which
was
loosely
tied
to
the
side
of
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
poking
about
with
this
instrument
,
in
the
course
of
which
his
face
assumed
a
variety
of
distracted
expressions
,
Mr
Barkis
poked
it
against
a
box
,
an
end
of
which
had
been
visible
to
me
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
Then
his
face
became
composed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Old
clothes
,
"
said
Mr
Barkis
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
it
was
Money
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Barkis
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
it
was
,
indeed
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
But
it
AIN'T
,
"
said
Mr
Barkis
,
opening
both
his
eyes
as
wide
as
he
possibly
could
.
   
<EOS>
I
expressed
myself
quite
sure
of
that
,
and
Mr
Barkis
,
turning
his
eyes
more
gently
to
his
wife
,
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
She
's
the
usefullest
and
best
of
women
,
C*P
Barkis
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
praise
that
anyone
can
give
to
C*P
Barkis
,
she
deserves
,
and
more
!
<EOS>
My
dear
,
you
'll
get
a
dinner
today
,
for
company
;
something
good
to
eat
and
drink
<EOS>
,
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
should
have
protested
against
this
unnecessary
demonstration
in
my
honour
,
but
that
I
saw
Peggotty
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
bed
,
extremely
anxious
I
should
not
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
held
my
peace
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
got
a
trifle
of
money
somewhere
about
me
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Barkis
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
'm
a
little
tired
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
and
Mr
David
will
leave
me
for
a
short
nap
,
I
'll
try
and
find
it
when
I
wake
.
"
   
<EOS>
We
left
the
room
,
in
compliance
with
this
request
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
got
outside
the
door
,
Peggotty
informed
me
that
Mr
Barkis
,
being
now
"
a
little
nearer
"
than
he
used
to
be
<EOS>
,
always
resorted
to
this
same
device
before
producing
a
single
coin
from
his
store
;
and
that
he
endured
unheard
-
of
agonies
in
crawling
out
of
bed
alone
,
and
taking
it
from
that
unlucky
box
.
 
<EOS>
In
effect
,
we
presently
heard
him
uttering
suppressed
groans
of
the
most
dismal
nature
,
as
this
magpie
proceeding
racked
him
in
every
joint
;
but
while
Peggotty
's
eyes
were
full
of
compassion
for
him
,
she
said
his
generous
impulse
would
do
him
good
,
and
it
was
better
not
to
check
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
groaned
on
,
until
he
had
got
into
bed
again
,
suffering
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
a
martyrdom
;
and
then
called
us
in
,
pretending
to
have
just
woke
up
from
a
refreshing
sleep
,
and
to
produce
a
guinea
from
under
his
pillow
.
 
<EOS>
His
satisfaction
in
which
happy
imposition
on
us
,
and
in
having
preserved
the
impenetrable
secret
of
the
box
,
appeared
to
be
a
sufficient
compensation
to
him
for
all
his
tortures
.
   
<EOS>
I
prepared
Peggotty
for
Steerforth
's
arrival
and
<EOS>
it
was
not
long
before
he
came
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
persuaded
<EOS>
she
knew
no
difference
between
his
having
been
a
personal
benefactor
of
hers
,
and
a
kind
friend
to
me
,
and
that
she
would
have
received
him
with
the
utmost
gratitude
and
devotion
in
any
case
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
easy
,
spirited
good
humour
;
his
genial
manner
,
his
handsome
looks
,
his
natural
gift
of
adapting
himself
to
whomsoever
he
pleased
,
and
making
direct
,
when
he
cared
to
do
it
,
to
the
main
point
of
interest
in
anybody
's
heart
;
<EOS>
bound
her
to
him
wholly
in
five
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
His
manner
to
me
,
alone
,
would
have
won
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
through
all
these
causes
combined
,
I
sincerely
believe
she
had
a
kind
of
adoration
for
him
before
he
left
the
house
that
night
.
   
<EOS>
He
stayed
there
with
me
to
dinner
---
if
I
were
to
say
willingly
,
I
should
not
half
express
how
readily
and
gaily
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
into
Mr
Barkis
's
room
like
light
and
air
,
brightening
and
refreshing
it
as
if
he
were
healthy
weather
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
noise
,
no
effort
,
no
consciousness
,
in
anything
he
did
;
but
in
everything
an
indescribable
lightness
,
a
seeming
impossibility
of
doing
anything
else
,
or
doing
anything
better
,
which
was
so
graceful
,
so
natural
,
and
agreeable
,
that
it
overcomes
me
,
even
now
,
in
the
remembrance
.
   
<EOS>
We
made
merry
in
the
little
parlour
,
where
the
Book
of
Martyrs
,
unthumbed
since
my
time
,
was
laid
out
upon
the
desk
as
of
old
,
and
where
I
now
turned
over
its
terrific
pictures
,
remembering
the
old
sensations
they
had
awakened
,
but
not
feeling
them
.
 
<EOS>
When
Peggotty
spoke
of
what
she
called
my
room
,
and
of
its
being
ready
for
me
at
night
,
and
of
her
hoping
I
would
occupy
it
,
before
I
could
so
much
as
look
at
Steerforth
,
hesitating
,
he
was
possessed
of
the
whole
case
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
sleep
here
,
while
we
stay
,
and
I
shall
sleep
at
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
to
bring
you
so
far
,
"
I
returned
,
"
and
to
separate
,
seems
bad
companionship
,
Steerforth
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
in
the
name
of
Heaven
,
where
do
you
naturally
belong
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
"
seems
"
,
compared
to
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
settled
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
He
maintained
all
his
delightful
qualities
to
the
last
,
until
we
started
forth
,
at
eight
o'clock
,
for
Mr
Peggotty
's
boat
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
they
were
more
and
more
brightly
exhibited
as
the
hours
went
on
;
for
I
thought
even
then
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
now
,
that
the
consciousness
of
success
in
his
determination
to
please
,
inspired
him
with
a
new
delicacy
of
perception
,
and
made
it
,
subtle
as
it
was
,
more
easy
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
If
anyone
had
told
me
,
then
,
that
all
this
was
a
brilliant
game
,
played
for
the
excitement
of
the
moment
,
for
the
employment
of
high
spirits
,
in
the
thoughtless
love
of
superiority
,
in
a
mere
wasteful
careless
course
of
winning
what
was
worthless
to
him
,
and
next
minute
thrown
away
---
I
say
,
if
anyone
had
told
me
such
a
lie
that
night
,
I
wonder
in
what
manner
of
receiving
it
my
indignation
would
have
found
a
vent
!
 
<EOS>
Probably
only
in
an
increase
,
had
that
been
possible
,
of
the
romantic
feelings
of
fidelity
and
friendship
with
which
I
walked
beside
him
,
over
the
dark
wintry
sands
towards
the
old
boat
;
the
wind
sighing
around
us
even
more
mournfully
,
than
it
had
sighed
and
moaned
upon
the
night
when
I
first
darkened
Mr
Peggotty
's
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
wild
kind
of
place
,
Steerforth
,
is
it
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dismal
enough
in
the
dark
,
"
he
said
:
"
and
the
sea
roars
as
if
it
were
hungry
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
Is
that
the
boat
,
where
I
see
a
light
yonder
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
boat
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
it
's
the
same
I
saw
this
morning
,
"
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
came
straight
to
it
,
by
instinct
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
said
no
more
as
we
approached
the
light
,
but
made
softly
for
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
I
laid
my
hand
upon
the
latch
;
and
whispering
Steerforth
to
keep
close
to
me
,
went
in
.
   
<EOS>
A
murmur
of
voices
had
been
audible
on
the
outside
,
and
,
at
the
moment
of
our
entrance
,
a
clapping
of
hands
:
which
latter
noise
,
I
was
surprised
to
see
,
proceeded
from
the
generally
disconsolate
Mrs
Gummidge
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Gummidge
was
not
the
only
person
there
who
was
unusually
excited
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
,
his
face
lighted
up
with
uncommon
satisfaction
,
and
laughing
with
all
his
might
,
held
his
rough
arms
wide
open
,
as
if
for
little
Em'ly
to
run
into
them
;
<EOS>
Ham
,
with
a
mixed
expression
in
his
face
of
admiration
,
exultation
,
and
a
lumbering
sort
of
bashfulness
that
sat
upon
him
very
well
,
held
little
Em'ly
by
the
hand
,
as
if
he
were
presenting
her
to
Mr
Peggotty
;
little
Em'ly
herself
,
blushing
and
shy
,
but
delighted
with
Mr
Peggotty
's
delight
,
as
her
joyous
eyes
expressed
,
was
stopped
by
our
entrance
(
for
she
saw
us
first
)
in
the
very
act
of
springing
from
Ham
to
nestle
in
Mr
Peggotty
's
embrace
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
first
glimpse
we
had
of
them
all
,
and
at
the
moment
of
our
passing
from
the
dark
cold
night
into
the
warm
light
room
,
this
was
the
way
in
which
they
were
all
employed
:
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
in
the
background
,
clapping
her
hands
like
a
madwoman
.
   
<EOS>
The
little
picture
was
so
instantaneously
dissolved
by
our
going
in
,
that
one
might
have
doubted
whether
it
had
ever
been
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
in
the
midst
of
the
astonished
family
,
face
to
face
with
Mr
Peggotty
,
and
holding
out
my
hand
to
him
,
when
Ham
shouted
:
   
"
Mas'r
Davy
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
Mas'r
Davy
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
a
moment
we
were
all
shaking
hands
with
one
another
,
and
asking
one
another
how
we
did
,
and
telling
one
another
how
glad
we
were
to
meet
,
and
all
talking
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
was
so
proud
and
overjoyed
to
see
us
,
that
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
or
do
,
but
kept
over
and
over
again
shaking
hands
with
me
,
and
then
with
Steerforth
,
and
then
with
me
,
and
then
ruffling
his
shaggy
hair
all
over
his
head
,
and
laughing
with
such
glee
and
triumph
,
that
it
was
a
treat
to
see
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
that
you
two
gent'lmen
---
<EOS>
gent'lmen
growed
---
should
come
to
this
here
roof
tonight
,
of
all
nights
in
my
life
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
is
such
a
thing
as
never
happened
afore
,
I
do
rightly
believe
!
 
<EOS>
Em'ly
,
my
darling
,
come
here
!
 
<EOS>
Come
here
,
my
little
witch
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
Mas'r
Davy
's
friend
,
my
dear

<EOS>
There
's
the
gent'lman
as
you
've
heerd
on
,
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
He
comes
to
see
you
,
along
with
Mas'r
Davy
,
on
the
brightest
night
of
your
uncle
's
life
as
ever
was
or
will
be
,
Gorm
the
t'other
one
,
and
horroar
for
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
After
delivering
this
speech
all
in
a
breath
,
and
with
extraordinary
animation
and
pleasure
,
Mr
Peggotty
put
one
of
his
large
hands
rapturously
on
each
side
of
his
niece
's
face
,
and
kissing
it
a
dozen
times
,
laid
it
with
a
gentle
pride
and
love
upon
his
broad
chest
,
and
patted
it
as
if
his
hand
had
been
a
lady
's
.
<EOS>
Then
he
let
her
go
;
and
as
she
ran
into
the
little
chamber
where
I
used
to
sleep
,
looked
round
upon
us
,
quite
hot
and
out
of
breath
with
his
uncommon
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
you

gent'lmen

said
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So

cried
Ham
.
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"

said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
do

his

out
again

has
made
off

<EOS>
Would
you
be
so
good
as

,
Mawther
,
for
a
minute
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
nodded
and
disappeared
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
this
ai
n't
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
sitting
down
among
us
by
the
fire
,
"
the
brightest
night
<EOS>
o

<EOS>
my

I
'm

in
a
low
voice
to
Steerforth
,
"
---
her
as
you
see
a
blushing
here
just
now
<EOS>
---
"
   
Steerforth
only
nodded
;
but
with
such
a
pleased
expression
of
interest
,
and
of
participation
in
Mr
Peggotty
's
feelings
,
that
the
latter
answered
him
as
if
he
had
spoken
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
her
,
and
so
she
is
.
<EOS>
Thankee
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Ham
nodded
to
me
several
times
,
as
if
he
would
have
said
so
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
here
little
Em'ly
of
ours
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
has
been
,
in
our
house
,
<EOS>
what
I
suppose
(
I
'm
a
ignorant
man
,
but
that
's
my
belief
)
<EOS>
no
one
but
a
little
bright
-
eyed
creetur
can
be
in
a
house
.
<EOS>
She
ai

my

I
never
had
one

but
I
could
n't
love
her
more

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
I
could
n't
do
it

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
quite
understand
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
do
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
and
thankee
again
.
<EOS>
Mas'r
Davy
,
he
can
remember
what
she
was
;
you
may
judge
for
your
own
self
what
she
is
;
but
neither
of
you
ca
n't
fully
know
what
she
has
been
,
is
,
and
will
be
,
to
my
loving
art

<EOS>
I
am
rough
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
<EOS>
I
am
as
rough
as
a
Sea
Porkypine
;
but
no
one
,
unless
,
mayhap
,
it
is
a
woman
,
can
know
,
I
think
,
what
our

is
to
me

<EOS>
And

sinking
his

lower
yet

"
<EOS>
that

though

"
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
ruffled
his
hair
again
,
with
both
hands
,
as
a
further
preparation
for
what
he
was
going
to
say
,
and
went
on
,
with
a
hand
upon
each
of
his
knees
:
   
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
certain
person
as
had
know'd
our
Em'ly
,
from
the
time
when
her
father
was
drownded
;
as
had
seen
her
constant
;
when
a
babby
,
when
a
young
gal
,
when
a
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Not
much
of
a
person
to
look
at
,
he
warn't
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
something
<EOS>
o
'
my
own
build
---
rough
---
<EOS>
a
good
deal
o
'
the
sou'-wester
in
him
---
wery
salt
---
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
whole
,
a
honest
sort
of
a
chap
,
with
his
art
in
the
right
place
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
thought
I
had
never
seen
Ham
grin
to
anything
like
the
extent
to
which
he
sat
grinning
at
us
now
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
does
this
here
blessed
tarpaulin
go
and
do
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
with
his
face
one
high
noon
of
enjoyment
,
"
but
he
loses
that
<EOS>
there
art
of
his
to
our
little
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
He
follers
her
about
,
he
makes
hisself
a
sort
<EOS>
o
'
servant
to
her
,
he
loses
in
a
great
measure
his
relish
for
his
wittles
,
and
in
the
long
-
run
he
makes
it
clear
to
me
<EOS>
wot
's
amiss
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
could
wish
myself
,
you
see
,
that
our
little
Em'ly
was
in
a
fair
way
of
being
married
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
wish
to
see
her
,
at
all
ewents
,
under
articles
to
a
honest
man
as
had
a
right
to
defend
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
long
I
may
live
,
or
how
soon
I
may
die
;
but
I
know
that
if
I
was
capsized
,
any
night
,
in
a
gale
of
wind
in
Yarmouth
Roads
here
,
and
was
to
see
the
town
-
lights
shining
for
the
last
time
over
the
rollers
as
I
could
n't
make
no
head
against
,
I
could
go
down
quieter
for
thinking
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
man
ashore
there
,
iron
-
true
to
my
little
Em'ly
,
God
bless
her
,
and
no
wrong
can
touch
my
Em'ly
while
so
be
as
that
man
lives
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
,
in
simple
earnestness
,
waved
his
right
arm
,
as
if
he
were
waving
it
at
the
town
-
lights
for
the
last
time
,
and
then
,
exchanging
a
nod
with
Ham
,
whose
eye
he
caught
,
proceeded
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
counsels
him
to
speak
to
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
big
enough
,
but
he
's
bashfuller
than
a
little
un
,
and
he
do
n't
like
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
speak
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
!
 
Him
!
"
says
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Him
that
I
've
know'd
<EOS>
so
intimate
so
many
years
,
and
like
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Uncle
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
can
have
him
.
<EOS>
He
's
such
a
good
fellow
!
<EOS>
"
I
gives
her
a
kiss
,
and
I
says
no
more
to
her
than
,
"
My
dear
,
you
're
right
to
speak
out
<EOS>
,
you
're
to
choose
for
yourself
,
you
're
as
free
as
a
little
bird
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
I
aways
to
him
,
and
I
says
,
"
I
wish
it
could
have
been
so
,
but
it
ca
n't
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
can
both
be
as
you
was
,
and
wot
<EOS>
I
say
to
you
is
,
Be
as
you
was
with
her
,
like
a
man
.
"
<EOS>
He
says
to
me
,
a
-
shaking
of
my
hand
,
"
I
will
!
"
<EOS>
he
says
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
was
---
honourable
and
manful
---
for
two
year
going
on
,
and
we
was
just
the
same
at
home
here
as
afore
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
's
face
,
which
had
varied
in
its
expression
with
the
various
stages
of
his
narrative
,
now
resumed
all
its
former
triumphant
delight
,
as
he
laid
a
hand
upon
my
knee
and
a
hand
upon
Steerforth
's
(
previously
wetting
them
both
,
for
the
greater
emphasis
of
the
action
)
,
and
divided
the
following
speech
between
us
:
   
<EOS>
"
All
of
a
sudden
,
one
evening
---
as
it
might
be
tonight
---
comes
little
Em'ly
from
her
work
,
and
him
with
her
!
 
<EOS>
There
ai
n't
so
much
in
that
,
you
'll
say
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
because
he
takes
care
on
her
,
like
a
brother
,
arter
dark
,
and
indeed
afore
dark
,
and
at
all
times
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
tarpaulin
chap
,
he
takes
hold
of
her
hand
,
and
he
cries
out
to
me
,
joyful
,
"
Look
here
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
to
be
my
little
wife
!
"
<EOS>
And
she
says
,
<EOS>
half
bold
and
half
shy
,
and
half
a
laughing
and
half
a
crying
,
"
Yes
,
Uncle
!
 
<EOS>
If
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
---
If
I
please
!
"
cried
Mr
Peggotty
,
rolling
his
head
in
an
ecstasy
at
the
idea
;
"
Lord
,
as
if
I
should
do
anythink
else
!
---
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
I
am
steadier
now
,
and
I
have
thought
better
of
it
,
and
I
'll
be
as
good
a
little
wife
as
I
can
to
him
,
for
he
's
a
dear
,
good
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
Then
Missis
Gummidge
,
she
claps
her
hands
like
a
play
,
and
you
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
Theer
!
<EOS>
the
murder
's
out
!
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
---
"
You
come
in
!
 
<EOS>
It
took
place
this
here
present
hour
;
and
here
's
the
man
that
'll
marry
her
,
the
minute
<EOS>
she
's
out
of
her
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
Ham
staggered
,
as
well
he
might
,
under
the
blow
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
dealt
him
in
his
unbounded
joy
,
as
a
mark
of
confidence
and
friendship
;
but
feeling
called
upon
to
say
something
to
us
,
he
said
,
with
much
faltering
and
great
difficulty
:
   
"
She
warn't
<EOS>
no
higher
than
you
was
,
Mas'r
Davy
---
when
you
first
come
---
when
I
thought
what
she
'd
grow
up
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
her
grown
up
---
gent'lmen
---
like
a
flower
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
lay
down
my
life
for
her
---
<EOS>
Mas'r
Davy
---
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
most
content
and
cheerful
!
 
<EOS>
She
's
more
to
me
---
gent'lmen
---
<EOS>
than
<EOS>
---
she
's
all
to
me
that
ever
I
can
want
,
and
more
than
ever
I
---
than
ever
I
could
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
love
her
true
.
 
<EOS>
There
ai
n't
a
gent'lman
in
all
the
land
---
nor
yet
sailing
upon
all
the
sea
---
that
can
love
his
lady
more
than
I
love
her
,
though
there
's
many
a
common
man
---
would
say
better
---
what
he
meant
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
thought
it
affecting
to
see
such
a
sturdy
fellow
as
Ham
was
now
,
trembling
in
the
strength
of
what
he
felt
for
the
pretty
little
creature
who
had
won
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
the
simple
confidence
reposed
in
us
by
Mr
Peggotty
and
by
himself
,
was
,
in
itself
,
affecting
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
affected
by
the
story
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
How
far
my
emotions
were
influenced
by
the
recollections
of
my
childhood
,
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
I
had
come
there
with
any
lingering
fancy
that
I
was
still
to
love
little
Em'ly
,
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
was
filled
with
pleasure
by
all
this
;
but
,
at
first
,
with
an
indescribably
sensitive
pleasure
,
that
a
very
little
would
have
changed
to
pain
.
   
<EOS>
Therefore
,
if
it
had
depended
upon
me
to
touch
the
prevailing
chord
among
them
with
any
skill
,
I
should
have
made
a
poor
hand
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
it
depended
upon
Steerforth
;
and
he
did
it
with
such
address
,
that
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
all
as
easy
and
as
happy
as
it
was
possible
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
he
said
,
"
you
are
a
thoroughly
good
fellow
,
and
deserve
to
be
as
happy
as
you
are
tonight
.
 
<EOS>
My
hand
upon
it
!
 
<EOS>
Ham
,
I
give
you
joy
,
my
boy
.
 
<EOS>
My
hand
upon
that
,
too
!
 
<EOS>
Daisy
,
stir
the
fire
,
and
make
it
a
brisk
one
!
<EOS>
and
Mr
Peggotty
,
unless
you
can
induce
your
gentle
niece
to
come
back
(
for
whom
I
vacate
this
seat
in
the
corner
)
,
I
shall
go
.
 
<EOS>
Any
gap
at
your
fireside
on
such
a
night
---
such
a
gap
least
of
all
---
I
would
n't
make
,
for
the
wealth
of
the
Indies
!
"
   
<EOS>
So
Mr
Peggotty
went
into
my
old
room
to
fetch
little
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
little
Em'ly
did
n't
like
to
come
,
and
then
Ham
went
.
<EOS>
Presently
they
brought
her
to
the
fireside
,
very
much
confused
,
and
very
shy
,
---
but
she
soon
became
more
assured
when
she
found
how
gently
and
respectfully
Steerforth
spoke
to
her
;
how
skilfully
he
avoided
anything
that
would
embarrass
her
<EOS>
;
how
he
talked
to
Mr
Peggotty
of
boats
,
and
ships
,
and
tides
,
and
fish
;
how
he
referred
to
me
about
the
time
when
he
had
seen
Mr
Peggotty
at
Salem
House
;
how
delighted
he
was
with
the
boat
and
all
belonging
to
it
;
how
lightly
and
easily
he
carried
on
,
until
he
brought
us
,
by
degrees
,
into
a
charmed
circle
,
and
we
were
all
talking
away
without
any
reserve
.
   
<EOS>
Em'ly
,
indeed
,
said
little
all
the
evening
;
but
she
looked
,
and
listened
,
and
her
face
got
animated
,
and
she
was
charming
.
<EOS>
Steerforth
told
a
story
of
a
dismal
shipwreck
(
which
arose
out
of
his
talk
with
Mr
Peggotty
)
,
as
if
he
saw
it
all
before
him
---
and
little
Em'ly
's
eyes
were
fastened
on
him
all
the
time
,
as
if
she
saw
it
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
us
a
merry
adventure
of
his
own
,
as
a
relief
to
that
,
with
as
much
gaiety
as
if
the
narrative
were
as
fresh
to
him
as
it
was
to
us
---
and
little
Em'ly
laughed
until
the
boat
rang
with
the
musical
sounds
,
and
we
all
laughed
(
Steerforth
too
)
,
in
irresistible
sympathy
with
what
was
so
pleasant
and
light
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
He
got
Mr
Peggotty
to
sing
,
or
rather
to
roar
,
"
When
the
stormy
winds
do
blow
,
do
blow
,
do
blow
"
;
and
he
sang
a
sailor
's
song
himself
,
so
pathetically
and
beautifully
,
that
I
could
have
almost
fancied
that
the
real
wind
creeping
sorrowfully
round
the
house
,
and
murmuring
low
through
our
unbroken
silence
,
was
there
to
listen
.
   
<EOS>
As
to
Mrs
Gummidge
,
he
roused
that
victim
of
despondency
with
a
success
never
attained
by
anyone
else
(
so
Mr
Peggotty
informed
me
)
,
since
the
decease
of
the
old
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
left
her
so
little
leisure
for
being
miserable
,
that
she
said
next
day
she
thought
she
must
have
been
bewitched
.
   
<EOS>
But
he
set
up
no
monopoly
of
the
general
attention
,
or
the
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
When
little
Em'ly
grew
more
courageous
,
and
talked
(
but
still
bashfully
)
across
the
fire
to
me
,
of
our
old
wanderings
upon
the
beach
,
to
pick
up
shells
and
pebbles
;
and
when
I
asked
her
if
she
recollected
how
I
used
to
be
devoted
to
her
;
and
when
we
both
laughed
and
reddened
,
casting
these
looks
back
on
the
pleasant
old
times
,
so
unreal
to
look
at
now
;
he
was
silent
and
attentive
,
and
observed
us
thoughtfully
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
,
at
this
time
,
and
all
the
evening
,
on
the
old
locker
in
her
old
little
corner
by
the
fire
---
<EOS>
Ham
beside
her
,
where
I
used
to
sit
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
satisfy
myself
whether
it
was
in
her
own
little
tormenting
way
,
or
in
a
maidenly
reserve
before
us
,
that
she
kept
quite
close
to
the
wall
,
and
away
from
him
;
but
I
observed
that
she
did
so
,
all
the
evening
.
   
<EOS>
As
I
remember
,
it
was
almost
midnight
when
we
took
our
leave
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
had
some
biscuit
and
dried
fish
for
supper
,
and
Steerforth
had
produced
from
his
pocket
a
full
flask
of
Hollands
,
which
we
men
(
I
may
say
we
men
,
now
,
without
a
blush
)
had
emptied
.
 
<EOS>
We
parted
merrily
;
and
as
they
all
stood
crowded
round
the
door
to
light
us
as
far
as
they
could
upon
our
road
,
I
saw
the
sweet
blue
eyes
of
little
Em'ly
peeping
after
us
,
from
behind
Ham
,
and
heard
her
soft
voice
calling
to
us
to
be
careful
how
we
went
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
most
engaging
little
Beauty
!
<EOS>
"
said
Steerforth
,
taking
my
arm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
quaint
place
,
and
they
are
quaint
company
,
and
it
's
quite
a
new
sensation
to
mix
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
fortunate
we
are
,
too
,
"
I
returned
,
"
to
have
arrived
to
witness
their
happiness
in
that
intended
marriage
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
people
so
happy
.
 
<EOS>
How
delightful
to
see
it
,
and
to
be
made
the
sharers
in
their
honest
joy
,
as
we
have
been
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
rather
a
chuckle
-
headed
fellow
for
the
girl
;
is
n't
he
?
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
been
so
hearty
with
him
,
and
with
them
all
,
that
I
felt
a
shock
in
this
unexpected
and
cold
reply
.
 
<EOS>
But
turning
quickly
upon
him
,
and
seeing
a
laugh
in
his
eyes
,
I
answered
,
much
relieved
:
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Steerforth
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
well
for
you
to
joke
about
the
poor
!
 
<EOS>
You
may
skirmish
with
Miss
Dartle
,
or
try
to
hide
your
sympathies
in
jest
from
me
,
but
I
know
better
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
see
how
perfectly
you
understand
them
,
how
exquisitely
you
can
enter
into
happiness
like
this
plain
fisherman
's
,
or
humour
a
love
like
my
old
nurse
's
,
<EOS>
I
know
that
there
is
not
a
joy
or
sorrow
,
not
an
emotion
,
of
such
people
,
that
can
be
indifferent
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
admire
and
love
you
for
it
,
Steerforth
,
twenty
times
the
more
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
and
,
looking
in
my
face
,
said
,
"
Daisy
,
I
believe
you
are
in
earnest
,
and
are
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
we
all
were
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Next
moment
he
was
gaily
singing
Mr
Peggotty
's
song
,
as
we
walked
at
a
round
pace
back
to
Yarmouth
.
      
<EOS>
Chapter
22
.
<EOS>
Some
old
scenes
,
and
some
new
people
 
Steerforth
and
I
stayed
for
more
than
a
fortnight
in
that
part
of
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
very
much
together
,
I
need
not
say
;
but
occasionally
we
were
asunder
for
some
hours
at
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
good
sailor
,
and
I
was
but
an
indifferent
one
;
and
when
he
went
out
boating
with
Mr
Peggotty
,
which
was
a
favourite
amusement
of
his
,
I
generally
remained
ashore
.
 
<EOS>
My
occupation
of
Peggotty
's
spare
-
room
put
a
constraint
upon
me
,
from
which
he
was
free
:
for
,
knowing
how
assiduously
she
attended
on
Mr
Barkis
all
day
,
I
did
not
like
to
remain
out
late
at
night
;
whereas
Steerforth
,
lying
at
the
Inn
,
had
nothing
to
consult
but
his
own
humour
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
it
came
about
,
that
I
heard
of
his
making
little
treats
for
the
fishermen
at
Mr
Peggotty
's
house
of
call
,
"
The
Willing
Mind
"
,
after
I
was
in
bed
,
and
of
his
being
afloat
,
wrapped
in
fishermen
's
clothes
,
whole
moonlight
nights
,
and
coming
back
when
the
morning
tide
was
at
flood
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
however
,
I
knew
that
his
restless
nature
and
bold
spirits
delighted
to
find
a
vent
in
rough
toil
and
hard
weather
,
as
in
any
other
means
of
excitement
that
presented
itself
freshly
to
him
;
so
none
of
his
proceedings
surprised
me
.
   
<EOS>
Another
cause
of
our
being
sometimes
apart
,
was
,
that
I
had
naturally
an
interest
in
going
over
to
Blunderstone
,
and
revisiting
the
old
familiar
scenes
of
my
childhood
;
while
Steerforth
,
after
being
there
once
,
had
naturally
no
great
interest
in
going
there
again
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
,
on
three
or
four
days
that
I
can
at
once
recall
,
we
went
our
several
ways
after
an
early
breakfast
,
and
met
again
at
a
late
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
idea
how
he
employed
his
time
in
the
interval
,
beyond
a
general
knowledge
that
he
was
very
popular
in
the
place
,
and
had
twenty
means
of
actively
diverting
himself
where
another
man
might
not
have
found
one
.
   
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
my
occupation
in
my
solitary
pilgrimages
was
to
recall
every
yard
of
the
old
road
as
I
went
along
it
,
and
to
haunt
the
old
spots
,
of
which
I
never
tired
.
 
<EOS>
I
haunted
them
,
as
my
memory
had
often
done
,
and
lingered
among
them
as
my
younger
thoughts
had
lingered
when
I
was
far
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
grave
beneath
the
tree
,
where
both
my
parents
lay
---
on
which
I
had
looked
out
,
when
it
was
my
father
's
only
,
with
such
curious
feelings
of
compassion
,
and
by
which
I
had
stood
,
so
desolate
,
when
it
was
opened
to
receive
my
pretty
mother
and
her
baby
---
the
grave
which
Peggotty
's
own
faithful
care
had
ever
since
kept
neat
,
and
made
a
garden
of
<EOS>
,
I
walked
near
,
by
the
hour
.
 
<EOS>
It
lay
a
little
off
the
churchyard
path
,
in
a
quiet
corner
,
not
so
far
removed
<EOS>
but
I
could
read
the
names
upon
the
stone
as
I
walked
to
and
fro
,
startled
by
the
sound
of
the
church
-
bell
when
it
struck
the
hour
,
for
it
was
like
a
departed
voice
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
reflections
at
these
times
were
always
associated
with
the
figure
I
was
to
make
in
life
,
and
the
distinguished
things
I
was
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
My
echoing
footsteps
went
to
no
other
tune
,
but
were
as
constant
to
that
as
if
I
had
come
home
to
build
my
castles
in
the
air
at
a
living
mother
's
side
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
great
changes
in
my
old
home
.
 
<EOS>
The
ragged
nests
,
so
long
deserted
by
the
rooks
,
were
gone
;
and
the
trees
were
lopped
and
topped
out
of
their
remembered
shapes
.
 
<EOS>
The
garden
had
run
wild
,
and
half
the
windows
of
the
house
were
shut
up
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
occupied
,
but
only
by
a
poor
lunatic
gentleman
,
and
the
people
who
took
care
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
always
sitting
at
my
little
window
,
looking
out
into
the
churchyard
;
and
I
wondered
whether
his
rambling
thoughts
ever
went
upon
any
of
the
fancies
that
used
to
occupy
mine
,
on
the
rosy
mornings
when
I
peeped
out
of
that
same
little
window
in
my
night
-
clothes
,
and
saw
the
sheep
quietly
feeding
in
the
light
of
the
rising
sun
.
   
<EOS>
Our
old
neighbours
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Grayper
,
were
gone
to
South
America
,
and
the
rain
had
made
its
way
through
the
roof
of
their
empty
house
,
and
stained
the
outer
walls
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chillip
was
married
again
to
a
tall
,
raw
-
boned
,
high
-
nosed
wife
;
and
they
had
a
weazen
little
baby
,
with
a
heavy
head
that
it
could
n't
hold
up
,
and
two
weak
staring
eyes
,
with
which
it
seemed
to
be
always
wondering
why
it
had
ever
been
born
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
with
a
singular
jumble
of
sadness
and
pleasure
that
I
used
to
linger
about
my
native
place
,
until
the
reddening
winter
sun
admonished
me
that
it
was
time
to
start
on
my
returning
walk
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
when
the
place
was
left
behind
,
and
especially
when
Steerforth
and
I
were
happily
seated
over
our
dinner
by
a
blazing
fire
,
it
was
delicious
to
think
of
having
been
there
.
 
<EOS>
So
it
was
,
though
in
a
softened
degree
,
when
I
went
to
my
neat
room
at
night
;
and
,
turning
over
the
leaves
of
the
crocodile
-
book
(
which
was
always
there
,
upon
a
little
table
)
<EOS>
,
remembered
with
a
grateful
heart
how
blest
I
was
in
having
such
a
friend
as
Steerforth
,
such
a
friend
as
Peggotty
,
and
such
a
substitute
for
what
I
had
lost
as
my
excellent
and
generous
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
MY
nearest
way
to
Yarmouth
,
in
coming
back
from
these
long
walks
,
was
by
a
ferry
.
 
<EOS>
It
landed
me
on
the
flat
between
the
town
and
the
sea
,
which
I
could
make
straight
across
,
and
so
save
myself
a
considerable
circuit
by
the
high
road
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
's
house
being
on
that
waste
-
place
,
and
not
a
hundred
yards
out
of
my
track
,
I
always
looked
in
as
I
went
by
.
 
<EOS>
Steerforth
was
pretty
sure
to
be
there
expecting
me
,
and
we
went
on
together
through
the
frosty
air
and
gathering
fog
towards
the
twinkling
lights
of
the
town
.
   
<EOS>
One
dark
evening
,
when
I
was
later
than
usual
---
for
I
had
,
that
day
,
been
making
my
parting
visit
to
Blunderstone
,
as
we
were
now
about
to
return
home
---
I
found
him
alone
in
Mr
Peggotty
's
house
,
sitting
thoughtfully
before
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
intent
upon
his
own
reflections
that
he
was
quite
unconscious
of
my
approach
.
<EOS>
This
,
indeed
,
he
might
easily
have
been
if
he
had
been
less
absorbed
,
for
footsteps
fell
noiselessly
on
the
sandy
ground
outside
;
but
even
my
entrance
failed
to
rouse
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
standing
close
to
him
,
looking
at
him
;
and
still
,
with
a
heavy
brow
,
he
was
lost
in
his
meditations
.
   
<EOS>
He
gave
such
a
start
when
I
put
my
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
that
he
made
me
start
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
come
upon
me
,
"
he
said
,
almost
angrily
,
"
like
a
reproachful
ghost
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
obliged
to
announce
myself
,
somehow
,
"
I
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
I
called
you
down
from
the
stars
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
Up
from
anywhere
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
taking
my
seat
near
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
looking
at
the
pictures
in
the
fire
,
"
he
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
spoiling
them
for
me
,
"
said
I
,
as
he
stirred
it
quickly
with
a
piece
of
burning
wood
,
striking
out
of
it
a
train
of
red
-
hot
sparks
that
went
careering
up
the
little
chimney
,
and
roaring
out
into
the
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
have
seen
them
,
"
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
detest
this
mongrel
time
,
neither
day
nor
night
.
 
<EOS>
How
late
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
Where
have
you
been
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
taking
leave
of
my
usual
walk
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
have
been
sitting
here
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
glancing
round
the
room
,
"
thinking
that
all
the
people
we
found
so
glad
on
the
night
of
our
coming
down
,
might
---
to
judge
from
the
present
wasted
air
of
the
place
---
be
dispersed
,
or
dead
,
or
come
to
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
harm
.
 
<EOS>
David
,
I
wish
to
God
I
had
had
a
judicious
father
these
last
twenty
years
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Steerforth
,
what
is
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
with
all
my
soul
I
had
been
better
guided
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
with
all
my
soul
I
could
guide
myself
better
!
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
passionate
dejection
in
his
manner
that
quite
amazed
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
more
unlike
himself
than
I
could
have
supposed
possible
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
better
to
be
this
poor
Peggotty
,
or
his
lout
of
a
nephew
,
"
he
said
,
getting
up
and
leaning
moodily
against
the
chimney
-
piece
,
with
his
face
towards
the
fire
,
"
than
to
be
myself
,
twenty
times
richer
and
twenty
times
wiser
,
and
be
the
torment
to
myself
that
I
have
been
,
in
this
Devil
's
bark
of
a
boat
,
within
the
last
half
-
hour
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
so
confounded
by
the
alteration
in
him
,
that
at
first
I
could
only
observe
him
in
silence
,
as
he
stood
leaning
his
head
upon
his
hand
,
and
looking
gloomily
down
at
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
I
begged
him
,
with
all
the
earnestness
I
felt
,
to
tell
me
what
had
occurred
to
cross
him
so
unusually
,
and
to
let
me
sympathize
with
him
,
if
I
could
not
hope
to
advise
him
.
 
<EOS>
Before
I
had
well
concluded
,
he
began
to
laugh
---
fretfully
at
first
,
but
soon
with
returning
gaiety
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tut
,
it
's
nothing
,
Daisy
!
<EOS>
nothing
!
"
<EOS>
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
at
the
inn
in
London
,
I
am
heavy
company
for
myself
,
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
a
nightmare
to
myself
,
just
now
---
must
have
had
one
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
At
odd
dull
times
,
nursery
tales
come
up
into
the
memory
,
unrecognized
for
what
they
are
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
been
confounding
myself
with
the
bad
boy
who
"
did
n't
care
"
,
and
became
food
for
lions
---
a
grander
kind
of
going
to
the
dogs
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
What
old
women
call
the
horrors
,
have
been
creeping
over
me
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
afraid
of
myself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
afraid
of
nothing
else
,
I
think
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
,
and
yet
may
have
enough
to
be
afraid
of
too
,
"
he
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
!
 
<EOS>
So
it
goes
by
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
about
to
be
hipped
again
,
David
;
but
I
tell
you
,
my
good
fellow
,
once
more
,
that
it
would
have
been
well
for
me
(
and
for
more
than
me
)
if
I
had
had
a
steadfast
and
judicious
father
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
face
was
always
full
of
expression
,
but
I
never
saw
it
express
such
a
dark
kind
of
earnestness
as
when
he
said
these
words
,
with
his
glance
bent
on
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
much
for
that
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
making
as
if
he
tossed
something
light
into
the
air
,
with
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
"
Why
,
being
gone
,
I
am
a
man
again
,
"
like
Macbeth
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
for
dinner
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
have
not
(
Macbeth
-
like
)
broken
up
the
feast
with
most
admired
disorder
,
Daisy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
where
are
they
all
,
I
wonder
!
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
God
knows
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
After
strolling
to
the
ferry
looking
for
you
,
I
strolled
in
here
and
found
the
place
deserted
.
<EOS>
That
set
me
thinking
,
and
you
found
me
thinking
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
advent
of
Mrs
Gummidge
with
a
basket
,
explained
how
the
house
had
happened
to
be
empty
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
hurried
out
to
buy
something
that
was
needed
,
against
Mr
Peggotty
's
return
with
the
tide
;
and
had
left
the
door
open
in
the
meanwhile
,
lest
Ham
and
little
Em'ly
,
with
whom
it
was
an
early
night
,
<EOS>
should
come
home
while
she
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Steerforth
,
after
very
much
improving
Mrs
Gummidge
's
spirits
by
a
cheerful
salutation
and
a
jocose
embrace
,
took
my
arm
,
and
hurried
me
away
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
improved
his
own
spirits
,
no
less
than
Mrs
Gummidge
's
,
for
they
were
again
at
their
usual
flow
,
and
he
was
full
of
vivacious
conversation
as
we
went
along
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
"
he
said
,
gaily
,
"
we
abandon
this
buccaneer
life
tomorrow
,
do
we
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
we
agreed
,
"
I
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
our
places
by
the
coach
are
taken
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
there
's
no
help
for
it
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
almost
forgotten
that
there
is
anything
to
do
in
the
world
but
to
go
out
tossing
on
the
sea
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
there
was
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
long
as
the
novelty
should
last
,
"
said
I
,
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Like
enough
,
"
he
returned
;
"
though
there
's
a
sarcastic
meaning
in
that
observation
for
an
amiable
piece
of
innocence
like
my
young
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
am
a
capricious
fellow
,
David
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
am
;
but
while
the
iron
is
hot
,
I
can
strike
it
vigorously
too
.
<EOS>
I
could
pass
a
reasonably
good
examination
already
,
as
a
pilot
in
these
waters
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
says
you
are
a
wonder
,
"
I
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
nautical
phenomenon
,
eh
?
"
laughed
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
he
does
,
and
you
know
how
truly
;
I
know
how
ardent
you
are
in
any
pursuit
you
follow
,
and
how
easily
you
can
master
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
amazes
me
most
in
you
,
Steerforth
---
that
you
should
be
contented
with
such
fitful
uses
of
your
powers
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Contented
?
"
<EOS>
he
answered
,
merrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
never
contented
,
except
with
your
freshness
,
my
gentle
Daisy
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
fitfulness
,
I
have
never
learnt
the
art
of
binding
myself
to
any
of
the
wheels
on
which
the
Ixions
of
these
days
are
turning
round
and
round
.
 
<EOS>
I
missed
it
somehow
in
a
bad
apprenticeship
,
and
now
do
n't
care
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
---
You
know
I
have
bought
a
boat
down
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
an
extraordinary
fellow
you
are
,
Steerforth
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
,
stopping
---
for
this
was
the
first
I
had
heard
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
you
may
never
care
to
come
near
the
place
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
,
"
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
taken
a
fancy
to
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
"
walking
me
briskly
on
,
"
I
have
bought
a
boat
that
was
for
sale
---
a
clipper
,
Mr
Peggotty
says
;
and
so
she
is
---
and
Mr
Peggotty
will
be
master
of
her
in
my
absence
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
I
understand
you
,
Steerforth
!
"
<EOS>
said
I
,
exultingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
pretend
to
have
bought
it
for
yourself
,
but
you
have
really
done
so
to
confer
a
benefit
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
might
have
known
as
much
at
first
,
knowing
you
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
kind
Steerforth
,
how
can
I
tell
you
what
I
think
of
your
generosity
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tush
!
"
<EOS>
he
answered
,
turning
red
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
less
said
,
the
better
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
I
know
<EOS>
?
"
cried
I
,
"
did
n't
I
say
that
there
was
not
a
joy
,
or
sorrow
,
or
any
emotion
of
such
honest
hearts
that
was
indifferent
to
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
"
he
answered
,
"
you
told
me
all
that
.
 
<EOS>
There
let
it
rest
.
<EOS>
We
have
said
enough
!
"
   
<EOS>
Afraid
of
offending
him
by
pursuing
the
subject
when
he
made
so
light
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
only
pursued
it
in
my
thoughts
as
we
went
on
at
even
a
quicker
pace
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
must
be
newly
rigged
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
shall
leave
Littimer
behind
to
see
it
done
,
that
I
may
know
she
is
quite
complete
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
tell
you
Littimer
had
come
down
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
!
came
down
this
morning
,
with
a
letter
from
my
mother
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
our
looks
met
,
I
observed
that
he
was
pale
even
to
his
lips
,
though
he
looked
very
steadily
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
feared
that
some
difference
between
him
and
his
mother
might
have
led
to
his
being
in
the
frame
of
mind
in
which
I
had
found
him
at
the
solitary
fireside
.
 
<EOS>
I
hinted
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
,
and
giving
a
slight
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
of
the
sort
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
come
down
,
that
man
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
same
as
ever
?
<EOS>
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
same
as
ever
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Distant
and
quiet
as
the
North
Pole
.
 
<EOS>
He
shall
see
to
the
boat
being
fresh
named
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
the
"
Stormy
Petrel
"
now
.
 
<EOS>
What
does
Mr
Peggotty
care
for
Stormy
Petrels
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
have
her
christened
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
what
name
?
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
"
Little
Em'ly
"
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
had
continued
to
look
steadily
at
me
,
I
took
it
as
a
reminder
that
he
objected
to
being
extolled
for
his
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
showing
in
my
face
how
much
it
pleased
me
,
but
I
said
little
,
and
he
resumed
his
usual
smile
,
and
seemed
relieved
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
see
here
,
"
he
said
,
looking
before
us
,
"
where
the
original
little
Em'ly
comes
!
 
<EOS>
And
that
fellow
with
her
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
soul
,
he
's
a
true
knight
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
leaves
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
Ham
was
a
boat
-
builder
in
these
days
,
having
improved
a
natural
ingenuity
in
that
handicraft
,
until
he
had
become
a
skilled
workman
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
his
working
-
dress
,
and
looked
rugged
enough
,
but
manly
withal
,
and
a
very
fit
protector
for
the
blooming
little
creature
at
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
there
was
a
frankness
in
his
face
,
an
honesty
,
and
an
undisguised
show
of
his
pride
in
her
,
and
his
love
for
her
,
which
were
,
to
me
,
the
best
of
good
looks
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
,
as
they
came
towards
us
,
that
they
were
well
matched
even
in
that
particular
.
   
<EOS>
She
withdrew
her
hand
timidly
from
his
arm
as
we
stopped
to
speak
to
them
,
and
blushed
as
she
gave
it
to
Steerforth
and
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
passed
on
,
after
we
had
exchanged
a
few
words
,
she
did
not
like
to
replace
that
hand
,
but
,
still
appearing
timid
and
constrained
,
walked
by
herself
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
all
this
very
pretty
and
engaging
,
and
Steerforth
seemed
to
think
so
too
,
as
we
looked
after
them
fading
away
in
the
light
of
a
young
moon
.
   
<EOS>
Suddenly
there
passed
us
---
evidently
following
them
---
a
young
woman
whose
approach
we
had
not
observed
,
but
whose
face
I
saw
as
she
went
by
,
and
thought
I
had
a
faint
remembrance
of
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
lightly
dressed
;
looked
bold
,
and
haggard
,
and
flaunting
,
and
poor
;
but
seemed
,
for
the
time
,
to
have
given
all
that
to
the
wind
which
was
blowing
,
and
to
have
nothing
in
her
mind
but
going
after
them
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
dark
distant
level
,
absorbing
their
figures
into
itself
,
left
but
itself
visible
between
us
and
the
sea
and
clouds
,
her
figure
disappeared
in
like
manner
,
still
no
nearer
to
them
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
black
shadow
to
be
following
the
girl
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
standing
still
;
"
what
does
it
mean
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
spoke
in
a
low
voice
that
sounded
almost
strange
to
Me
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
must
have
it
in
her
mind
to
beg
of
them
,
I
think
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
A
beggar
would
be
no
novelty
,
"
said
Steerforth
;
"
but
it
is
a
strange
thing
that
the
beggar
should
take
that
shape
tonight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
no
better
reason
,
truly
,
than
because
I
was
thinking
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
pause
,
"
of
something
like
it
,
when
it
came
by
.
 
<EOS>
Where
the
Devil
did
it
come
from
,
I
wonder
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
From
the
shadow
of
this
wall
,
I
think
,
"
said
I
,
as
we
emerged
upon
a
road
on
which
a
wall
abutted
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
gone
!
"
<EOS>
he
returned
,
looking
over
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
all
ill
go
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Now
for
our
dinner
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
he
looked
again
over
his
shoulder
towards
the
sea
-
line
glimmering
afar
off
,
and
yet
again
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
wondered
about
it
,
in
some
broken
expressions
,
several
times
,
in
the
short
remainder
of
our
walk
;
and
only
seemed
to
forget
it
when
the
light
of
fire
and
candle
shone
upon
us
,
seated
warm
and
merry
,
at
table
.
   
<EOS>
Littimer
was
there
,
and
had
his
usual
effect
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
said
to
him
that
I
hoped
Mrs
Steerforth
and
Miss
Dartle
were
well
,
he
answered
respectfully
(
and
of
course
respectably
)
,
that
they
were
tolerably
well
,
he
thanked
me
,
and
had
sent
their
compliments
.
<EOS>
This
was
all
,
and
yet
he
seemed
to
me
to
say
as
plainly
as
a
man
could
say
:
"
You
are
very
young
,
sir
;
you
are
exceedingly
young
.
"
   
<EOS>
We
had
almost
finished
dinner
,
when
taking
a
step
or
two
towards
the
table
,
from
the
corner
where
he
kept
watch
upon
us
,
or
rather
upon
me
,
as
I
felt
,
he
said
to
his
master
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mowcher
is
down
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
cried
Steerforth
,
much
astonished
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Mowcher
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
on
earth
does
she
do
here
?
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
appears
to
be
her
native
part
of
the
country
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
She
informs
me
that
she
makes
one
of
her
professional
visits
here
,
every
year
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
met
her
in
the
street
this
afternoon
,
and
she
wished
to
know
if
she
might
have
the
honour
of
waiting
on
you
after
dinner
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
the
Giantess
in
question
,
Daisy
?
"
inquired
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
confess
<EOS>
---
I
felt
ashamed
,
even
of
being
at
this
disadvantage
before
Littimer
---
that
Miss
Mowcher
and
I
were
wholly
unacquainted
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
shall
know
her
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
"
<EOS>
for
she
is
one
of
the
seven
wonders
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
When
Miss
Mowcher
comes
,
show
her
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
felt
some
curiosity
and
excitement
about
this
lady
,
especially
as
Steerforth
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughing
when
I
referred
to
her
,
and
positively
refused
to
answer
any
question
of
which
I
made
her
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
remained
,
therefore
,
in
a
state
of
considerable
expectation
until
the
cloth
had
been
removed
some
half
an
hour
,
and
we
were
sitting
over
our
decanter
of
wine
before
the
fire
,
when
the
door
opened
,
and
Littimer
,
with
his
habitual
serenity
quite
undisturbed
,
announced
:
   
"
Miss
Mowcher
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
looked
at
the
doorway
and
saw
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
still
looking
at
the
doorway
,
thinking
that
Miss
Mowcher
was
a
long
while
making
her
appearance
,
when
,
to
my
infinite
astonishment
,
there
came
waddling
round
a
sofa
which
stood
between
me
and
it
,
a
pursy
dwarf
,
of
about
forty
or
forty
-
five
,
with
a
very
large
head
and
face
,
a
pair
of
roguish
grey
eyes
,
and
such
extremely
little
arms
,
that
,
to
enable
herself
to
lay
a
finger
archly
against
her
snub
nose
,
as
she
ogled
Steerforth
,
she
was
obliged
to
meet
the
finger
half
-
way
,
and
lay
her
nose
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
Her
chin
,
which
was
what
is
called
a
double
chin
,
was
so
fat
that
it
entirely
swallowed
up
the
strings
of
her
bonnet
,
bow
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
Throat
<EOS>
she
had
none
;
waist
she
had
none
;
legs
she
had
none
,
worth
mentioning
;
for
though
she
was
more
than
full
-
sized
down
to
where
her
waist
would
have
been
,
if
she
had
had
any
,
and
though
she
terminated
,
as
human
beings
generally
do
,
in
a
pair
of
feet
,
she
was
so
short
that
she
stood
at
a
common
-
sized
chair
as
at
a
table
,
resting
a
bag
she
carried
on
the
seat
.
 
<EOS>
This
lady
---
dressed
in
an
off
-
hand
,
easy
style
;
bringing
her
nose
and
her
forefinger
together
,
with
the
difficulty
I
have
described
;
standing
with
her
head
necessarily
on
one
side
,
and
,
with
one
of
her
sharp
eyes
shut
up
,
making
an
uncommonly
knowing
face
---
after
ogling
Steerforth
for
a
few
moments
,
broke
into
a
torrent
of
words
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
My
flower
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
pleasantly
began
,
shaking
her
large
head
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
there
,
are
you
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
naughty
boy
,
fie
for
shame
,
what
do
you
do
so
far
away
from
home
?
 
<EOS>
Up
to
mischief
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
're
a
downy
fellow
,
Steerforth
,
so
you
are
,
and
<EOS>
I
'm
another
,
ai
n't
I
?
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
You
'd
have
betted
a
hundred
pound
to
five
,
now
,
that
you
would
n't
have
seen
me
here
,
would
n't
you
?
<EOS>
Bless
you
,
man
alive
,
I
'm
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
here
and
there
,
and
where
not
,
like
the
conjurer
's
half
-
crown
in
the
lady
's
handkercher
.
 
<EOS>
Talking
of
handkerchers
---
and
talking
of
ladies
---
what
a
comfort
<EOS>
you
are
to
your
blessed
mother
,
ai
n't
you
,
my
dear
boy
,
over
one
of
my
shoulders
,
and
I
do
n't
say
which
!
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Mowcher
untied
her
bonnet
,
at
this
passage
of
her
discourse
,
threw
back
the
strings
,
and
sat
down
,
panting
,
on
a
footstool
in
front
of
the
fire
---
making
a
kind
of
arbour
of
the
dining
table
,
which
spread
its
mahogany
shelter
above
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
my
stars
and
what's
-
their
-
names
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
went
on
,
clapping
a
hand
on
each
of
her
little
knees
,
and
glancing
shrewdly
at
me
,
"
I
'm
of
too
full
a
habit
<EOS>
,
that
's
the
fact
,
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
flight
of
stairs
,
it
gives
me
as
much
trouble
to
draw
every
breath
I
want
,
as
if
it
was
a
bucket
of
water
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
saw
me
looking
out
of
an
upper
window
,
you
'd
think
I
was
a
fine
woman
,
would
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
that
,
wherever
I
saw
you
,
"
replied
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Go
along
,
you
dog
,
do
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
little
creature
,
making
a
whisk
at
him
with
the
handkerchief
with
which
she
was
wiping
her
face
,
"
and
do
n't
be
impudent
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
give
you
my
word
and
honour
<EOS>
I
was
at
Lady
Mithers
's
last
week
---
THERE
'S
a
woman
!
 
<EOS>
How
SHE
wears
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
Mithers
himself
came
into
the
room
where
I
was
waiting
for
her
---
<EOS>
THERE
'S
a
man
!
 
<EOS>
How
HE
wears
!
<EOS>
and
his
wig
too
,
for
he
's
had
it
these
ten
years
---
and
he
went
on
at
that
rate
in
the
complimentary
line
,
that
I
began
to
think
I
should
be
obliged
to
ring
the
bell
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
 
<EOS>
He
's
a
pleasant
wretch
,
but
he
wants
principle
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
were
you
doing
for
Lady
Mithers
?
"
asked
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
tellings
,
my
blessed
infant
,
"
she
retorted
,
tapping
her
nose
again
,
screwing
up
her
face
,
and
twinkling
her
eyes
like
an
imp
of
supernatural
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
YOU
mind
!
 
<EOS>
You
'd
like
to
know
whether
I
stop
her
hair
from
falling
off
,
or
dye
it
,
or
touch
up
her
complexion
,
or
improve
her
eyebrows
,
would
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
And
so
you
shall
,
<EOS>
my
darling
---
when
I
tell
you
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
what
my
great
grandfather
's
name
was
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
Walker
,
my
sweet
pet
,
"
replied
Miss
Mowcher
,
"
and
he
came
of
a
long
line
of
Walkers
,
that
I
inherit
all
the
Hookey
estates
from
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
never
beheld
anything
approaching
to
Miss
Mowcher
's
wink
except
Miss
Mowcher
's
self
-
possession
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
a
wonderful
way
too
,
when
listening
to
what
was
said
to
her
,
or
when
waiting
for
an
answer
to
what
she
had
said
herself
,
of
pausing
with
her
head
cunningly
on
one
side
,
and
one
eye
turned
up
like
a
magpie
's
.
 
<EOS>
Altogether
I
was
lost
in
amazement
,
and
sat
staring
at
her
,
quite
oblivious
,
I
am
afraid
,
of
the
laws
of
politeness
.
   
<EOS>
She
had
by
this
time
drawn
the
chair
to
her
side
,
and
was
busily
engaged
in
producing
from
the
bag
(
plunging
in
her
short
arm
to
the
shoulder
,
at
every
dive
)
<EOS>
a
number
of
small
bottles
,
sponges
,
combs
,
brushes
,
bits
of
flannel
,
little
pairs
of
curling
-
irons
,
and
other
instruments
,
which
she
tumbled
in
a
heap
upon
the
chair
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
employment
she
suddenly
desisted
,
and
said
to
Steerforth
,
much
to
my
confusion
:
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
your
friend
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
said
Steerforth
;
"
he
wants
to
know
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
he
shall
!
 
<EOS>
I
thought
he
looked
as
if
he
did
!
"
returned
Miss
Mowcher
,
waddling
up
to
me
,
bag
in
hand
,
and
laughing
on
me
as
she
came
.
 
<EOS>
"
Face
like
a
peach
!
"
<EOS>
standing
on
tiptoe
to
pinch
my
cheek
as
I
sat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
tempting
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
very
fond
of
peaches
.
 
<EOS>
Happy
to
make
your
acquaintance
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
said
that
I
congratulated
myself
on
having
the
honour
to
make
hers
,
and
that
the
happiness
was
mutual
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
goodness
,
how
polite
we
are
!
"
exclaimed
Miss
Mowcher
,
making
a
preposterous
attempt
to
cover
her
large
face
with
her
morsel
of
a
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
world
of
gammon
and
spinnage
<EOS>
it
is
,
though
,
ai
n't
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
addressed
confidentially
to
both
of
us
,
as
the
morsel
of
a
hand
came
away
from
the
face
,
and
buried
itself
,
arm
and
all
,
in
the
bag
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
Miss
Mowcher
?
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
refreshing
set
of
humbugs
we
are
,
to
be
sure
,
ai
n't
we
,
my
sweet
child
?
"
<EOS>
replied
that
morsel
of
a
woman
,
feeling
in
the
bag
with
her
head
on
one
side
and
her
eye
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
here
!
"
taking
something
out
.
 
<EOS>
"
Scraps
of
the
Russian
Prince
's
nails
.
 
<EOS>
Prince
Alphabet
turned
topsy
-
turvy
,
I
call
him
,
for
his
name
's
got
all
the
letters
in
it
,
higgledy
-
piggledy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Russian
Prince
is
a
client
of
yours
,
is
he
?
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
,
my
pet
,
"
replied
Miss
Mowcher
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
keep
his
nails
in
order
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Twice
a
week
!
 
<EOS>
Fingers
and
toes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
pays
well
,
I
hope
?
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pays
,
as
he
speaks
,
my
dear
child
---
through
the
nose
,
"
replied
Miss
Mowcher
.
 
<EOS>
"
None
of
your
close
shavers
the
Prince
ai
n't
.
 
<EOS>
You
'd
say
so
,
if
you
saw
his
moustachios
.
 
<EOS>
Red
by
nature
,
black
by
art
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
your
art
,
of
course
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Mowcher
winked
assent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Forced
to
send
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Could
n't
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
climate
affected
his
dye
;
it
did
very
well
in
Russia
,
but
it
was
no
go
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
saw
such
a
rusty
Prince
in
all
your
born
days
as
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
Like
old
iron
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
why
you
called
him
a
humbug
,
just
now
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
're
a
broth
of
a
boy
,
ai
n't
you
?
"
returned
Miss
Mowcher
,
shaking
her
head
violently
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
what
a
set
of
humbugs
we
were
in
general
,
and
<EOS>
I
showed
you
the
scraps
of
the
Prince
's
nails
to
prove
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
Prince
's
nails
do
more
for
me
in
private
families
of
the
genteel
sort
,
than
all
my
talents
put
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
carry
'em
about
.
 
<EOS>
They
're
the
best
introduction
.
 
<EOS>
If
Miss
Mowcher
cuts
the
Prince
's
nails
,
she
must
be
all
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
'em
away
to
the
young
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
They
put
'em
in
albums
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
 
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
Upon
my
life
,
"
the
whole
social
system
"
(
as
the
men
call
it
when
they
make
speeches
in
Parliament
)
is
a
system
of
Prince
's
nails
!
"
said
this
least
of
women
,
trying
to
fold
her
short
arms
,
and
nodding
her
large
head
.
   
<EOS>
Steerforth
laughed
heartily
,
and
I
laughed
too
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mowcher
continuing
all
the
time
to
shake
her
head
(
which
was
very
much
on
one
side
)
,
and
to
look
into
the
air
with
one
eye
,
and
to
wink
with
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
smiting
her
small
knees
,
and
rising
,
"
this
is
not
business
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
Steerforth
,
let
's
explore
the
polar
regions
,
and
have
it
over
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
then
selected
two
or
three
of
the
little
instruments
,
and
a
little
bottle
,
and
asked
(
to
my
surprise
)
if
the
table
would
bear
.
<EOS>
On
Steerforth
's
replying
in
the
affirmative
,
she
pushed
a
chair
against
it
,
and
begging
the
assistance
of
my
hand
,
mounted
up
,
pretty
nimbly
,
to
the
top
,
as
if
it
were
a
stage
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
either
of
you
saw
my
ankles
,
"
she
said
,
when
she
was
safely
elevated
,
"
say
so
,
and
I
'll
go
home
and
destroy
myself
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
"
cried
Miss
Mowcher
,
"
I
'll
consent
to
live
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
ducky
,
ducky
,
ducky
,
come
to
Mrs
Bond
and
be
killed
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
an
invocation
to
Steerforth
to
place
himself
under
her
hands
;
who
,
accordingly
,
sat
himself
down
,
with
his
back
to
the
table
,
and
his
laughing
face
towards
me
,
and
submitted
his
head
to
her
inspection
,
evidently
for
no
other
purpose
than
our
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
To
see
Miss
Mowcher
standing
over
him
,
looking
at
his
rich
profusion
of
brown
hair
through
a
large
round
magnifying
glass
,
which
she
took
out
of
her
pocket
,
was
a
most
amazing
spectacle
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
pretty
fellow
!
"
said
Miss
Mowcher
,
after
a
brief
inspection
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'd
be
as
bald
as
a
friar
on
the
top
of
your
head
in
twelve
months
,
but
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
just
half
a
minute
,
my
young
friend
,
and
we
'll
give
you
a
polishing
that
shall
keep
your
curls
on
for
the
next
ten
years
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
,
she
tilted
some
of
the
contents
of
the
little
bottle
on
to
one
of
the
little
bits
of
flannel
,
and
,
again
imparting
some
of
the
virtues
of
that
preparation
to
one
of
the
little
brushes
,
began
rubbing
and
scraping
away
with
both
on
the
crown
of
Steerforth
's
head
in
the
busiest
manner
I
ever
witnessed
,
talking
all
the
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
Charley
Pyegrave
,
the
duke
's
son
,
"
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
Charley
?
<EOS>
"
peeping
round
into
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
little
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
man
HE
is
!
 
<EOS>
THERE
'S
a
whisker
!
 
<EOS>
As
to
Charley
's
legs
,
if
they
were
only
a
pair
(
which
they
ai
n't
)
,
they
'd
defy
competition
.
<EOS>
Would
you
believe
he
tried
to
do
without
me
---
in
the
Life
-
Guards
,
too
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mad
!
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
looks
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
mad
or
sane
,
he
tried
,
"
returned
Miss
Mowcher
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
does
he
do
,
but
,
lo
and
behold
you
,
he
goes
into
a
perfumer
's
shop
,
and
wants
to
buy
a
bottle
of
the
Madagascar
Liquid
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Charley
does
?
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Charley
does
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
have
n't
got
any
of
the
Madagascar
Liquid
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
Something
to
drink
?
"
asked
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
drink
?
"
returned
Miss
Mowcher
,
stopping
to
slap
his
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
doctor
his
own
moustachios
with
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
woman
in
the
shop
---
elderly
female
---
quite
a
Griffin
---
who
had
never
even
heard
of
it
by
name
.
 
<EOS>
"
Begging
pardon
,
sir
,
"
said
the
Griffin
to
Charley
,
"
it
's
not
---
not
---
not
ROUGE
,
is
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Rouge
,
"
said
Charley
to
the
Griffin
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
the
unmentionable
to
ears
polite
,
do
you
think
I
want
with
rouge
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
offence
,
sir
,
"
said
the
Griffin
;
"
we
have
it
asked
for
by
so
many
names
<EOS>
,
I
thought
it
might
be
.
"
<EOS>
Now
that
,
my
child
,
"
continued
Miss
Mowcher
,
rubbing
all
the
time
as
busily
as
ever
,
"
is
another
instance
of
the
refreshing
humbug
I
was
speaking
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
something
in
that
way
myself
---
perhaps
a
good
deal
---
perhaps
a
little
---
sharp
's
the
word
,
my
dear
boy
---
never
mind
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
what
way
do
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
In
the
rouge
way
?
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Put
this
and
that
together
,
my
tender
pupil
,
"
returned
the
wary
Mowcher
,
touching
her
nose
,
"
work
it
by
the
rule
of
Secrets
in
all
trades
,
and
the
product
will
give
you
the
desired
result

<EOS>
I
say
I
do
a
little
in
that
way
myself
.
 
<EOS>
One
Dowager
,
SHE
calls
it
lip
-
salve

<EOS>
Another
<EOS>
,
SHE
calls
it
gloves

<EOS>
Another

SHE
calls

tucker

edging

<EOS>
Another
<EOS>
,
SHE
calls

a
fan

<EOS>
I
call
it
whatever
THEY
call
it

<EOS>
I
supply
it
for
'em
,
but
we
keep
up
the
trick
so
,
to
one
another
,
and
make
believe
with
such
a
face
,
that
they
'd
as
soon
think
of
laying
it
on
,
before
a
whole
drawing
-
room
,
as
before
me

<EOS>
And
when
I
wait
upon
'em
,
they
'll
say
to
me
sometimes
---
WITH
IT
ON

thick
,
and
no
mistake

"
How
am
I
looking
,
Mowcher

Am

pale

Ha

ha
!
<EOS>
ha

<EOS>
Is
n't
THAT
refreshing
,
my
young
friend
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
never
did
in
my
days
<EOS>
behold
anything
like
Mowcher
as
she
stood
upon
the
dining
table
,
intensely
enjoying
this
refreshment
,
rubbing
busily
at
Steerforth
's
head
,
and
winking
at
me
over
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Such
things
are
not
much
in
demand
hereabouts
.
<EOS>
That
sets
me
off
again
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
n't
seen
a
pretty
woman
since
I
've
been
here
,
jemmy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
?
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
the
ghost
of
one
,
"
replied
Miss
Mowcher
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
could
show
her
the
substance
of
one
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
said
Steerforth
,
addressing
his
eyes
to
mine
.
 
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
Daisy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Aha
?
"
cried
the
little
creature
,
glancing
sharply
at
my
face
,
and
then
peeping
round
at
Steerforth
's
.
 
<EOS>
"
Umph
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
first
exclamation
sounded
like
a
question
put
to
both
of
us
,
and
the
second
like
a
question
put
to
Steerforth
only
.
 
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
have
found
no
answer
to
either
,
but
continued
to
rub
,
with
her
head
on
one
side
and
her
eye
turned
up
,
as
if
she
were
looking
for
an
answer
in
the
air
and
were
confident
of
its
appearing
presently
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
sister
of
yours
,
Mr
Copperfield
?
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
after
a
pause
,
and
still
keeping
the
same
look
-
out
.
 
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
before
I
could
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
of
the
sort
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
Mr
Copperfield
used
---
or
I
am
much
mistaken
---
to
have
a
great
admiration
for
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
has
n't
he
now
?
"
returned
Miss
Mowcher
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
he
fickle
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
for
shame
!
 
<EOS>
Did
he
sip
every
flower
,
and
change
every
hour
,
until
Polly
his
passion
requited
?
---
<EOS>
Is
her
name
Polly
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
Elfin
suddenness
with
which
she
pounced
upon
me
with
this
question
,
and
a
searching
look
,
quite
disconcerted
me
for
a
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Miss
Mowcher
<EOS>
,
"
I
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Her
name
is
Emily
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aha
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
exactly
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
Umph
?
 
<EOS>
What
a
rattle
I
am
!
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
ai
n't
I
volatile
?
"
   
<EOS>
Her
tone
and
look
implied
something
that
was
not
agreeable
to
me
in
connexion
with
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
said
,
in
a
graver
manner
than
any
of
us
had
yet
assumed
:
"
She
is
as
virtuous
as
she
is
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
engaged
to
be
married
to
a
most
worthy
and
deserving
man
in
her
own
station
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
esteem
her
for
her
good
sense
,
as
much
as
I
admire
her
for
her
good
looks
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
said
!
"
cried
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
,
hear
,
hear
!
 
<EOS>
Now
I
'll
quench
the
curiosity
of
this
little
Fatima
,
my
dear
Daisy
,
by
leaving
her
nothing
to
guess
at
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
at
present
apprenticed
,
Miss
Mowcher
,
or
articled
,
or
whatever
it
may
be
,
to
Omer
and
Joram
,
Haberdashers
,
Milliners
,
and
so
forth
,
in
this
town
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
observe
?
 
<EOS>
Omer
and
Joram
.
 
<EOS>
The
promise
of
which
my
friend
has
spoken
,
is
made
and
entered
into
with
her
cousin
;
Christian
name
,
Ham
;
surname
,
Peggotty
;
occupation
,
boat
-
builder
;
also
of
this
town
.
 
<EOS>
She
lives
with
a
relative
;
Christian
name
,
unknown
;
surname
,
Peggotty
;
occupation
,
seafaring
;
<EOS>
also
of
this
town
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
the
prettiest
and
most
engaging
little
fairy
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
admire
her
---
as
my
friend
does
---
exceedingly
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
were
not
that
I
might
appear
to
disparage
her
Intended
,
which
I
know
my
friend
would
not
like
,
I
would
add
,
that
to
me
she
seems
to
be
throwing
herself
away
;
that
I
am
sure
she
might
do
better
;
and
that
I
swear
she
was
born
to
be
a
lady
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Mowcher
listened
to
these
words
,
which
were
very
slowly
and
distinctly
spoken
,
with
her
head
on
one
side
,
and
her
eye
in
the
air
as
if
she
were
still
looking
for
that
answer
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
ceased
she
became
brisk
again
in
an
instant
,
and
rattled
away
with
surprising
volubility
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
And
that
's
all
about
it
<EOS>
,
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
trimming
his
whiskers
with
a
little
restless
pair
of
scissors
,
that
went
glancing
round
his
head
in
all
directions
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
:
very
well
!
<EOS>
Quite
a
long
story
.
 
<EOS>
Ought
to
end
"
<EOS>
and
they
lived
happy
ever
afterwards
"
;
ought
n't
it
?
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
What
's
that
game
at
forfeits
?
 
<EOS>
I
love
my
love
with
an
E^
,
because
she
's
enticing
;
I
hate
her
with
an
E^
,
because
she
's
engaged
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
her
to
the
sign
of
the
exquisite
,
and
treated
her
with
an
elopement
,
her
name
's
Emily
,
and
she
lives
in
the
east
?
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
ai
n't
I
volatile
?
"
   
<EOS>
Merely
looking
at
me
with
extravagant
slyness
,
and
not
waiting
for
any
reply
,
she
continued
,
without
drawing
breath
:
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
 
<EOS>
If
ever
any
scapegrace
was
trimmed
and
touched
up
to
perfection
,
you
are
,
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
understand
any
noddle
in
the
world
,
I
understand
yours
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
me
when
I
tell
you
that
,
my
darling
?
 
<EOS>
I
understand
yours
,
"
peeping
down
into
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
you
may
mizzle
,
jemmy
(
as
we
say
at
Court
)
,
and
if
Mr
Copperfield
will
take
the
chair
I
'll
operate
on
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
,
Daisy
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Steerforth
,
laughing
,
and
resigning
his
seat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
be
improved
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Miss
Mowcher
,
not
this
evening
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
no
,
"
returned
the
little
woman
,
looking
at
me
with
the
aspect
of
a
connoisseur
;
"
a
little
bit
more
eyebrow
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
I
returned
,
"
some
other
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
it
carried
half
a
quarter
of
an
inch
towards
the
temple
,
"
said
Miss
Mowcher
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
can
do
it
in
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
Not
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Go
in
for
a
tip
,
"
she
urged
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
?
 
<EOS>
Let
's
get
the
scaffolding
up
,
then
,
for
a
pair
of
whiskers
.
 
<EOS>
Come
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
blushing
as
I
declined
,
for
I
felt
we
were
on
my
weak
point
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
But
Miss
Mowcher
,
finding
that
I
was
not
at
present
disposed
for
any
decoration
within
the
range
of
her
art
,
and
that
I
was
,
for
the
time
being
,
proof
against
the
blandishments
of
the
small
bottle
which
she
held
up
before
one
eye
to
enforce
her
persuasions
,
<EOS>
said
we
would
make
a
beginning
on
an
early
day
,
and
requested
the
aid
of
my
hand
to
descend
from
her
elevated
station
.
<EOS>
Thus
assisted
,
she
skipped
down
with
much
agility
,
and
began
to
tie
her
double
chin
into
her
bonnet
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
fee
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
"
is
---
"
   
"
Five
bob
,
"
replied
Miss
Mowcher
,
"
and
dirt
cheap
,
my
chicken
.
<EOS>
Ai
n't
I
volatile
,
Mr
Copperfield
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
replied
politely
:
"
Not
at
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
I
thought
she
was
rather
so
,
when
she
tossed
up
his
two
half
-
crowns
like
a
goblin
pieman
,
caught
them
,
dropped
them
in
her
pocket
,
and
gave
it
a
loud
slap
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
Till
!
"
<EOS>
observed
Miss
Mowcher
,
standing
at
the
chair
again
,
and
replacing
in
the
bag
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
little
objects
she
had
emptied
out
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
I
got
all
my
traps
?
 
<EOS>
It
seems
so
.
 
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
do
to
be
like
long
Ned
Beadwood
,
when
they
took
him
to
church
"
to
marry
him
to
somebody
"
,
as
he
says
,
and
left
the
bride
behind
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
 
<EOS>
A
wicked
rascal
,
Ned
,
but
droll
!
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
know
I
'm
going
to
break
your
hearts
,
but
I
am
forced
to
leave
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
call
up
all
your
fortitude
,
and
try
to
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
!
 
<EOS>
Take
care
of
yourself
,
jockey
of
Norfolk
!
 
<EOS>
How
I
have
been
rattling
on
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
the
fault
of
you
<EOS>
two
wretches
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgive
you
!
 
<EOS>
"
Bob
swore
!
"
<EOS>
---
as
the
Englishman
said
for
"
Good
night
"
,
when
he
first
learnt
French
,
and
thought
it
so
like
English
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bob
swore
,
"
my
ducks
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
the
bag
slung
over
her
arm
,
and
rattling
as
she
waddled
away
,
she
waddled
to
the
door
,
where
she
stopped
to
inquire
if
she
should
leave
us
a
lock
of
her
hair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ai
n't
I
volatile
?
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
as
a
commentary
on
this
offer
,
and
,
with
her
finger
on
her
nose
,
departed
.
   
<EOS>
Steerforth
laughed
to
that
degree
,
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
help
laughing
too
;
though
I
am
not
sure
I
should
have
done
so
,
but
for
this
inducement
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
had
had
our
laugh
quite
out
,
which
was
after
some
time
,
he
told
me
that
Miss
Mowcher
had
quite
an
extensive
connexion
,
and
made
herself
useful
to
a
variety
of
people
in
a
variety
of
ways
.
 
<EOS>
Some
people
trifled
with
her
as
a
mere
oddity
,
he
said
;
but
she
was
as
shrewdly
and
sharply
observant
as
anyone
he
knew
,
and
as
long
-
headed
as
she
was
short
-
armed
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
that
what
she
had
said
of
being
here
,
and
there
,
and
everywhere
,
was
true
enough
;
for
she
made
little
darts
into
the
provinces
,
and
seemed
to
pick
up
customers
everywhere
,
and
to
know
everybody
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
him
what
her
disposition
was
:
whether
it
was
at
all
mischievous
,
and
if
her
sympathies
were
generally
on
the
right
side
of
things
:
but
,
not
succeeding
in
attracting
his
attention
to
these
questions
after
two
or
three
attempts
,
I
forbore
or
forgot
to
repeat
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
instead
,
with
much
rapidity
,
a
good
deal
about
her
skill
,
and
her
profits
;
and
about
her
being
a
scientific
cupper
,
if
I
should
ever
have
occasion
for
her
service
in
that
capacity
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
the
principal
theme
of
our
conversation
during
the
evening
:
<EOS>
and
when
we
parted
for
the
night
Steerforth
called
after
me
over
the
banisters
,
"
Bob
swore
!
"
<EOS>
as
I
went
downstairs
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
surprised
,
when
I
came
to
Mr
Barkis
's
house
,
to
find
Ham
walking
up
and
down
in
front
of
it
,
and
still
more
surprised
to
learn
from
him
that
little
Em'ly
was
inside
.
 
<EOS>
I
naturally
inquired
why
he
was
not
there
too
,
instead
of
pacing
the
streets
by
himself
?
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
see
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
he
rejoined
,
in
a
hesitating
manner
,
"
Em'ly
,
she
's
talking
to
some
'
un
in
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
thought
,
"
said
I
,
smiling
,
"
that
that
was
a
reason
for
your
being
in
here
too
,
Ham
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
in
a
general
way
,
so
'
t
would
be
,
"
he
returned
;
"
but
look'ee
here
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
lowering
his
voice
,
and
speaking
very
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
young
woman
,
sir
---
a
young
woman
,
that
Em'ly
knowed
once
,
and
doen't
ought
to
know
no
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
When
I
heard
these
words
,
a
light
began
to
fall
upon
the
figure
I
had
seen
following
them
,
some
hours
ago
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
poor
wurem
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
said
Ham
,
"
as
is
trod
under
foot
by
all
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
Up
street
and
down
street
.
 
<EOS>
The
mowld
o
'
<EOS>
the
churchyard
do
n't
hold
any
that
the
folk
shrink
away
from
,
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
I
see
her
tonight
,
Ham
,
on
the
sand
,
after
we
met
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Keeping
us
in
sight
?
"
said
Ham
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
like
you
did
,
Mas'r
Davy
.
<EOS>
Not
that
<EOS>
I
know'd
<EOS>
then
,
she
was
theer
,
sir
,
but
along
of
her
creeping
soon
arterwards
under
Em'ly
's
little
winder
,
when
she
see
the
light
come
,
and
whispering
"
Em'ly
,
Em'ly
,
for
Christ
's
sake
,
have
a
woman
's
heart
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
once
like
you
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Those
was
solemn
words
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
fur
to
hear
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
were
indeed
,
Ham
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
Em'ly
do
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Says
Em'ly
,
"
Martha
,
is
it
you
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Martha
,
can
it
be
you
?
"
<EOS>
---
for
they
had
sat
at
work
together
,
many
a
day
,
at
Mr
Omer
's
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
recollect
her
now
!
"
<EOS>
cried
I
,
recalling
one
of
the
two
girls
I
had
seen
when
I
first
went
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
recollect
her
quite
well
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Martha
Endell
,
"
said
Ham
.
 
<EOS>
"
Two
or
three
year
older
than
Em'ly
,
but
was
at
the
school
with
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
her
name
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
mean
to
interrupt
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
the
matter
o
'
<EOS>
that
,
Mas'r
Davy
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Ham
,
"
all
's
told
a'most
in
them
words
,
"
Em'ly
,
Em'ly
,
for
Christ
's
sake
,
have
a
woman
's
heart
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
once
like
you
!
"
<EOS>
She
wanted
to
speak
to
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
Em'ly
could
n't
speak
to
her
theer
,
for
her
loving
uncle
was
come
home
,
and
he
would
n't
---
<EOS>
no
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
said
Ham
,
with
great
earnestness
,
"
he
could
n't
,
kind
-
natur'd
,
tender
-
hearted
as
he
is
,
see
them
two
together
,
side
by
side
,
for
all
the
treasures
that
's
wrecked
in
the
sea
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
felt
how
true
this
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
it
,
on
the
instant
,
quite
as
well
as
Ham
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
Em'ly
writes
in
pencil
on
a
bit
of
paper
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
and
gives
it
to
her
out
o
'
winder
to
bring
here
.
 
<EOS>
"
Show
that
,
"
she
says
,
"
to
my
aunt
,
Mrs
Barkis
,
and
she
'll
set
you
down
by
her
fire
,
for
the
love
of
me
,
till
uncle
is
gone
out
,
and
I
can
come
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
and
by
she
tells
me
what
I
tell
you
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
and
asks
me
to
bring
her
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
She
doen't
ought
to
know
any
such
,
but
I
ca
n't
deny
her
,
when
the
tears
is
on
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
put
his
hand
into
the
breast
of
his
shaggy
jacket
,
and
took
out
with
great
care
a
pretty
little
purse
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
if
I
could
deny
her
when
the
tears
was
on
her
face
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
said
Ham
,
tenderly
adjusting
it
on
the
rough
palm
of
his
hand
,
"
how
could
I
deny
her
when
she
give
me
this
to
carry
for
her
---
knowing
what
she
brought
it
for
?
 
<EOS>
Such
a
toy
as
it
is
!
<EOS>
"
said
Ham
,
thoughtfully
looking
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
With
such
a
little
money
in
it
,
Em'ly
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
when
he
had
put
it
away
again
---
for
that
<EOS>
was
more
satisfactory
to
me
than
saying
anything
---
and
we
walked
up
and
down
,
for
a
minute
or
two
,
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
opened
then
,
and
Peggotty
appeared
,
beckoning
to
Ham
to
come
in
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
kept
away
,
but
she
came
after
me
,
entreating
me
to
come
in
too
.
 
<EOS>
Even
then
,
I
would
have
avoided
the
room
where
they
all
were
,
but
for
its
being
the
neat
-
tiled
kitchen
I
have
mentioned
more
than
once
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
opening
immediately
into
it
,
I
found
myself
among
them
before
I
considered
whither
I
was
going
.
   
<EOS>
The
girl
---
the
same
I
had
seen
upon
the
sands
---
was
near
the
fire
.
<EOS>
She
was
sitting
on
the
ground
,
with
her
head
and
one
arm
lying
on
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancied
,
from
the
disposition
of
her
figure
,
that
Em'ly
had
but
newly
risen
from
the
chair
,
and
that
the
forlorn
head
might
perhaps
have
been
lying
on
her
lap
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
but
<EOS>
little
of
the
girl
's
face
,
over
which
her
hair
fell
loose
and
scattered
,
as
if
she
had
been
disordering
it
with
her
own
hands
;
but
I
saw
that
she
was
young
,
and
of
a
fair
complexion
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
had
been
crying
.
 
<EOS>
So
had
little
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
spoken
when
we
first
went
in
;
and
the
Dutch
clock
by
the
dresser
seemed
,
in
the
silence
,
to
tick
twice
as
loud
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
Em'ly
spoke
first
.
   
<EOS>
"
Martha
wants
,
"
she
said
to
Ham
,
"
to
go
to
London
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
to
London
?
<EOS>
"
returned
Ham
.
   
<EOS>
He
stood
between
them
,
looking
on
the
prostrate
girl
with
a
mixture
of
compassion
for
her
,
and
of
jealousy
of
her
holding
any
companionship
with
her
whom
he
loved
so
well
,
which
I
have
always
remembered
distinctly
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
spoke
as
if
she
were
ill
;
in
a
soft
,
suppressed
tone
that
was
plainly
heard
,
although
it
hardly
rose
above
a
whisper
.
   
<EOS>
"
Better
there
than
here
,
"
said
a
third
voice
aloud
---
Martha
's
,
though
she
did
not
move
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
one
knows
me
there
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
knows
me
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
will
she
do
there
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Ham
.
   
<EOS>
She
lifted
up
her
head
,
and
looked
darkly
round
at
him
for
a
moment
;
then
laid
it
down
again
,
and
curved
her
right
arm
about
her
neck
,
as
a
woman
in
a
fever
,
or
in
an
agony
of
pain
from
a
shot
,
might
twist
herself
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
will
try
to
do
well
,
"
said
little
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
what
she
has
said
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
Does
he
---
do
they
---
aunt
?
"
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
shook
her
head
compassionately
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
try
,
"
said
Martha
,
"
if
you
'll
help
me
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
can
do
worse
than
I
have
done
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
do
better
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
with
a
dreadful
shiver
,
"
take
me
out
of
these
streets
,
where
the
whole
town
knows
me
from
a
child
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
Em'ly
held
out
her
hand
to
Ham
,
I
saw
him
put
in
it
a
little
canvas
bag
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
it
,
as
if
she
thought
it
were
her
purse
,
and
made
a
step
or
two
forward
;
but
finding
her
mistake
,
came
back
to
where
he
had
retired
near
me
,
and
showed
it
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
yourn
,
Em'ly
,
"
I
could
hear
him
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
nowt
in
all
the
wureld
that
ai
n't
yourn
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
of
no
delight
to
me
,
except
for
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
tears
rose
freshly
in
her
eyes
,
but
she
turned
away
and
went
to
Martha
.
 
<EOS>
What
she
gave
her
,
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
her
stooping
over
her
,
and
putting
money
in
her
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
She
whispered
something
,
as
she
asked
was
that
enough
?
 
<EOS>
"
More
than
enough
,
"
the
other
said
,
and
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
.
   
<EOS>
Then
Martha
arose
,
and
gathering
her
shawl
about
her
,
covering
her
face
with
it
,
and
weeping
aloud
,
went
slowly
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
She
stopped
a
moment
before
going
out
,
as
if
she
would
have
uttered
something
or
turned
back
;
but
no
word
passed
her
lips
.
 
<EOS>
Making
the
same
low
,
dreary
,
wretched
moaning
in
her
shawl
,
she
went
away
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
door
closed
,
little
Em'ly
looked
at
us
three
in
a
hurried
manner
and
then
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
,
and
fell
to
sobbing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Doen't
,
Em'ly
!
"
said
Ham
,
tapping
her
gently
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Doen't
,
my
dear
!
 
<EOS>
You
<EOS>
doen't
ought
to
cry
so
,
pretty
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Ham
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
still
weeping
pitifully
,
"
I
am
not
so
good
a
girl
as
I
ought
to
be
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
thankful
heart
,
sometimes
,
I
ought
to
have
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
<EOS>
yes
,
you
have
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
said
Ham
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
no
!
"
cried
little
Em'ly
,
sobbing
,
and
shaking
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
as
good
a
girl
as
I
ought
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Not
near
!
<EOS>
not
near
!
"
<EOS>
And
still
she
cried
,
as
if
her
heart
would
break
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
try
your
love
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
do
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
sobbed
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
often
cross
to
you
,
and
changeable
with
you
,
when
I
ought
to
be
far
different
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
never
so
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Why
am
I
ever
so
to
you
,
when
I
should
think
of
nothing
but
how
to
be
grateful
,
and
to
make
you
happy
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
always
make
me
so
,
"
said
Ham
,
"
my
dear
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
happy
in
the
sight
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
happy
,
all
day
long
,
in
the
thoughts
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
that
's
not
enough
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
because
you
are
good
;
not
because
I
am
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
dear
,
it
might
have
been
a
better
fortune
for
you
,
if
you
had
been
fond
of
someone
else
---
of
someone
steadier
and
much
worthier
than
me
,
who
was
all
bound
up
in
you
,
and
never
vain
and
changeable
like
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
little
tender
-
heart
,
"
said
Ham
,
in
a
low
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Martha
has
overset
her
,
altogether
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Please
,
aunt
,
"
sobbed
Em'ly
,
"
come
here
,
and
let
me
lay
my
head
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
am
very
miserable
tonight
,
aunt
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
am
not
as
good
a
girl
as
I
ought
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
,
I
know
!
"
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
had
hastened
to
the
chair
before
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Em'ly
,
with
her
arms
around
her
neck
,
kneeled
by
her
,
looking
up
most
earnestly
into
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
pray
,
aunt
,
try
to
help
me
!
 
<EOS>
Ham
,
dear
,
try
to
help
me
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
David
,
for
the
sake
of
old
times
,
do
,
please
,
try
to
help
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
be
a
better
girl
than
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
feel
a
hundred
times
more
thankful
than
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
feel
more
,
what
a
blessed
thing
it
is
to
be
the
wife
of
a
good
man
,
and
to
lead
a
peaceful
life
.
<EOS>
Oh
me
,
<EOS>
oh
me
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
my
heart
,
my
heart
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
dropped
her
face
on
my
old
nurse
's
breast
,
and
,
ceasing
this
supplication
,
which
in
its
agony
and
grief
was
half
a
woman
's
,
half
a
child
's
,
as
all
her
manner
was
(
being
,
in
that
,
more
natural
,
and
better
suited
to
her
beauty
,
as
I
thought
,
than
any
other
manner
could
have
been
)
,
wept
silently
,
while
my
old
nurse
hushed
her
like
an
infant
.
   
<EOS>
She
got
calmer
by
degrees
,
and
then
we
soothed
her
;
now
talking
encouragingly
,
and
now
jesting
a
little
with
her
,
until
she
began
to
raise
her
head
and
speak
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
So
we
got
on
,
until
she
was
able
to
smile
,
and
then
to
laugh
,
and
then
to
sit
up
,
half
ashamed
;
while
Peggotty
recalled
her
stray
ringlets
,
dried
her
eyes
,
and
made
her
neat
again
,
lest
her
uncle
should
wonder
,
when
she
got
home
,
why
his
darling
had
been
crying
.
   
<EOS>
I
saw
her
do
,
that
night
,
what
I
had
never
seen
her
do
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
her
innocently
kiss
her
chosen
husband
on
the
cheek
,
and
creep
close
to
his
bluff
form
as
if
it
were
her
best
support
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
went
away
together
,
in
the
waning
moonlight
,
and
I
looked
after
them
,
comparing
their
departure
in
my
mind
with
Martha
's
,
<EOS>
I
saw
that
she
held
his
arm
with
both
her
hands
,
and
still
kept
close
to
him
.
      
<EOS>
Chapter
23
.
<EOS>
I
corroborate
Mr
Dick
,
and
choose
a
profession
 
When
I
awoke
in
the
morning
<EOS>
I
thought
very
much
of
little
Em'ly
,
and
her
emotion
last
night
,
after
Martha
had
left
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
as
if
I
had
come
into
the
knowledge
of
those
domestic
weaknesses
and
tendernesses
in
a
sacred
confidence
,
and
that
to
disclose
them
,
even
to
Steerforth
,
would
be
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
gentler
feeling
towards
anyone
than
towards
the
pretty
creature
who
had
been
my
playmate
,
and
whom
I
have
always
been
persuaded
,
and
shall
always
be
persuaded
,
to
my
dying
day
,
I
then
devotedly
loved
.
 
<EOS>
The
repetition
to
any
ears
---
even
to
Steerforth
's
---
of
what
she
had
been
unable
to
repress
when
her
heart
lay
open
to
me
by
an
accident
,
I
felt
would
be
a
rough
deed
,
unworthy
of
myself
,
unworthy
of
the
light
of
our
pure
childhood
,
which
I
always
saw
encircling
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
a
resolution
,
therefore
,
to
keep
it
in
my
own
breast
;
and
there
it
gave
her
image
a
new
grace
.
   
<EOS>
While
we
were
at
breakfast
,
a
letter
was
delivered
to
me
from
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
contained
matter
on
which
I
thought
Steerforth
could
advise
me
as
well
as
anyone
,
and
on
which
I
knew
I
should
be
delighted
to
consult
him
,
I
resolved
to
make
it
a
subject
of
discussion
on
our
journey
home
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
present
we
had
enough
to
do
,
in
taking
leave
of
all
our
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
was
far
from
being
the
last
among
them
,
in
his
regret
at
our
departure
;
and
I
believe
would
even
have
opened
the
box
again
,
and
sacrificed
another
guinea
,
if
it
would
have
kept
us
eight
-
and
-
forty
hours
in
Yarmouth
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
and
all
her
family
were
full
of
grief
at
our
going
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
house
of
Omer
and
Joram
turned
out
to
bid
us
good
-
bye
;
and
there
were
so
many
seafaring
volunteers
in
attendance
on
Steerforth
,
when
our
portmanteaux
went
to
the
coach
,
that
if
we
had
had
the
baggage
of
a
regiment
with
us
,
we
should
hardly
have
wanted
porters
to
carry
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
we
departed
to
the
regret
and
admiration
of
all
concerned
,
and
left
a
great
many
people
very
sorry
behind
US
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
stay
long
here
,
Littimer
?
"
said
I
,
as
he
stood
waiting
to
see
the
coach
start
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
he
replied
;
"
probably
not
very
long
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
can
hardly
say
,
just
now
,
"
observed
Steerforth
,
carelessly
.
"
<EOS>
He
knows
what
he
has
to
do
,
and
he
'll
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
I
am
sure
he
will
,
"
said
I.
   
Littimer
touched
his
hat
in
acknowledgement
of
my
good
opinion
,
and
I
felt
about
eight
years
old
.
 
<EOS>
He
touched
it
once
more
,
wishing
us
a
good
journey
;
and
we
left
him
standing
on
the
pavement
,
as
respectable
a
mystery
as
any
pyramid
in
Egypt
.
   
<EOS>
For
some
little
time
we
held
no
conversation
,
Steerforth
being
unusually
silent
,
and
I
being
sufficiently
engaged
in
wondering
,
within
myself
,
when
I
should
see
the
old
places
again
,
and
what
new
changes
might
happen
to
me
or
them
in
the
meanwhile
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
Steerforth
,
becoming
gay
and
talkative
in
a
moment
,
as
he
could
become
anything
he
liked
at
any
moment
,
pulled
me
by
the
arm
:
   
<EOS>
"
Find
a
voice
,
David
.
 
<EOS>
What
about
that
letter
you
were
speaking
of
at
breakfast
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
I
,
taking
it
out
of
my
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
from
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
does
she
say
,
requiring
consideration
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
she
reminds
me
,
Steerforth
,
"
said
I
,
"
that
I
came
out
on
this
expedition
to
look
about
me
,
and
to
think
a
little
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Which
,
of
course
,
you
have
done
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
ca
n't
say
I
have
,
particularly
.
 
<EOS>
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
am
afraid
I
have
forgotten
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
look
about
you
now
,
and
make
up
for
your
negligence
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
to
the
right
,
and
you
'll
see
a
flat
country
,
with
a
good
deal
of
marsh
in
it
;
look
to
the
left
,
and
you
'll
see
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Look
to
the
front
,
and
you
'll
find
no
difference
<EOS>
;
look
to
the
rear
,
and
there
it
is
still
.
<EOS>
"
I
laughed
,
and
replied
that
I
saw
no
suitable
profession
in
the
whole
prospect
;
which
was
perhaps
to
be
attributed
to
its
flatness
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
says
our
aunt
on
the
subject
?
"
inquired
Steerforth
,
glancing
at
the
letter
in
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Does
she
suggest
anything
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
She
asks
me
,
here
,
if
I
think
I
should
like
to
be
a
proctor
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
,
"
replied
Steerforth
,
coolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
as
well
do
that
as
anything
else
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
I
could
not
help
laughing
again
,
at
his
balancing
all
callings
and
professions
so
equally
;
and
I
told
him
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
a
proctor
,
Steerforth
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
he
is
a
sort
of
monkish
attorney
,
"
replied
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
,
to
some
faded
courts
held
in
Doctors
'
Commons
,
---
a
lazy
old
nook
near
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
---
what
solicitors
are
to
the
courts
of
law
and
equity
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
functionary
whose
existence
,
in
the
natural
course
of
things
,
would
have
terminated
about
two
hundred
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
best
what
he
is
,
by
telling
you
what
Doctors
'
Commons
is
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
little
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
place
,
where
they
administer
what
is
called
ecclesiastical
law
,
and
play
all
kinds
of
tricks
with
obsolete
old
monsters
of
acts
of
Parliament
,
which
three
-
fourths
of
the
world
know
nothing
about
,
and
the
other
fourth
supposes
to
have
been
dug
up
,
in
a
fossil
state
,
in
the
days
of
the
Edwards
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
place
that
has
an
ancient
monopoly
in
suits
about
people
's
wills
and
people
's
marriages
,
and
disputes
among
ships
and
boats
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
Steerforth
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
there
is
any
affinity
between
nautical
matters
and
ecclesiastical
matters
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
,
indeed
,
my
dear
boy
,
"
he
returned
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
mean
to
say
that
they
are
managed
and
decided
by
the
same
set
of
people
,
down
in
that
same
Doctors
'
Commons
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
go
there
one
day
,
and
find
them
blundering
through
half
the
nautical
terms
in
Young
's
Dictionary
,
apropos
of
the
"
Nancy
"
having
run
down
the
"
Sarah
Jane
"
,
or
Mr
Peggotty
and
the
Yarmouth
boatmen
having
put
off
in
a
gale
of
wind
with
an
anchor
and
cable
to
the
"
Nelson
"
Indiaman
in
distress
;
and
you
shall
go
there
another
day
,
and
find
them
deep
in
the
evidence
,
pro
and
con
,
respecting
a
clergyman
who
has
misbehaved
himself
;
and
you
shall
find
the
judge
in
the
nautical
case
,
the
advocate
in
the
clergyman
's
case
,
or
contrariwise
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
like
actors
:
now
a
man
's
a
judge
,
and
now
he
is
not
a
judge
;
now
he
's
one
thing
<EOS>
,
now
he
's
another
;
now
he
's
something
else
,
change
and
change
about
;
but
it
's
always
a
very
pleasant
,
profitable
little
affair
of
private
theatricals
,
presented
to
an
uncommonly
select
audience
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
advocates
and
proctors
are
not
one
and
the
same
?
"
<EOS>
said
I
,
a
little
puzzled
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
they
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
returned
Steerforth
,
"
the
advocates
are
civilians
---
men
who
have
taken
a
doctor
's
degree
at
college
---
which
is
the
first
reason
of
my
knowing
anything
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
proctors
employ
the
advocates
.
 
<EOS>
Both
get
very
comfortable
fees
,
and
altogether
they
make
a
mighty
snug
little
party
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
whole
,
I
would
recommend
you
to
take
to
Doctors
'
Commons
kindly
,
David
.
 
<EOS>
They
plume
themselves
on
their
gentility
there
,
I
can
tell
you
,
if
that
's
any
satisfaction
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
made
allowance
for
Steerforth
's
light
way
of
treating
the
subject
,
and
,
considering
it
with
reference
to
the
staid
air
of
gravity
and
antiquity
which
I
associated
with
that
"
lazy
old
nook
near
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
"
,
did
not
feel
indisposed
towards
my
aunt
's
suggestion
;
which
she
left
to
my
free
decision
,
making
no
scruple
of
telling
me
that
it
had
occurred
to
her
,
on
her
lately
visiting
her
own
proctor
in
Doctors
'
Commons
for
the
purpose
of
settling
her
will
in
my
favour
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
laudable
proceeding
on
the
part
of
our
aunt
,
at
all
events
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
when
I
mentioned
it
;
"
and
one
deserving
of
all
encouragement
.
 
<EOS>
Daisy
,
my
advice
is
that
you
take
kindly
to
Doctors
'
Commons
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
quite
made
up
my
mind
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
told
Steerforth
that
my
aunt
was
in
town
awaiting
me
(
as
I
found
from
her
letter
)
,
and
that
she
had
taken
lodgings
for
a
week
at
a
kind
of
private
hotel
at
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
,
where
there
was
a
stone
staircase
,
and
a
convenient
door
in
the
roof
;
my
aunt
being
firmly
persuaded
that
every
house
in
London
was
going
to
be
burnt
down
every
night
.
   
<EOS>
We
achieved
the
rest
of
our
journey
pleasantly
,
sometimes
recurring
to
Doctors
'
Commons
,
and
anticipating
the
distant
days
when
I
should
be
a
proctor
there
,
which
Steerforth
pictured
in
a
variety
of
humorous
and
whimsical
lights
,
that
made
us
both
merry
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
came
to
our
journey
's
end
,
he
went
home
,
engaging
to
call
upon
me
next
day
but
one
;
and
I
drove
to
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
,
where
I
found
my
aunt
up
,
and
waiting
supper
.
   
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
round
the
world
since
we
parted
,
we
could
hardly
have
been
better
pleased
to
meet
again
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
cried
outright
as
she
embraced
me
;
and
said
,
pretending
to
laugh
,
that
if
my
poor
mother
had
been
alive
,
that
silly
little
creature
would
have
shed
tears
,
she
had
no
doubt
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
you
have
left
Mr
Dick
behind
,
aunt
?
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
Janet
,
how
do
you
do
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
Janet
curtsied
,
hoping
I
was
well
,
I
observed
my
aunt
's
visage
lengthen
very
much
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
it
,
too
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
rubbing
her
nose
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
no
peace
of
mind
,
Trot
,
since
I
have
been
here
.
<EOS>
"
Before
I
could
ask
why
,
she
told
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
convinced
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
laying
her
hand
with
melancholy
firmness
on
the
table
,
"
that
Dick
's
character
is
not
a
character
to
keep
the
donkeys
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
confident
he
wants
strength
of
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
left
Janet
at
home
,
instead
,
and
then
my
mind
might
perhaps
have
been
at
ease
.
 
<EOS>
If
ever
there
was
a
donkey
trespassing
on
my
green
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
with
emphasis
,
"
there
was
one
this
afternoon
at
four
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
A
cold
feeling
came
over
me
from
head
to
foot
,
and
I
know
it
was
a
donkey
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
tried
to
comfort
her
on
this
point
,
but
she
rejected
consolation
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
donkey
,
"
said
my
aunt
;
"
and
it
was
the
one
with
the
stumpy
tail
which
that
Murdering
sister
of
a
woman
rode
,
when
she
came
to
my
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
This
had
been
,
ever
since
<EOS>
,
the
only
name
my
aunt
knew
for
Miss
Murdstone
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
there
is
any
Donkey
in
Dover
,
whose
audacity
it
is
harder
to
me
to
bear
than
another
's
,
that
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
striking
the
table
,
"
is
the
animal
!
"
   
<EOS>
Janet
ventured
to
suggest
that
my
aunt
might
be
disturbing
herself
unnecessarily
,
and
that
she
believed
the
donkey
in
question
was
then
engaged
in
the
sand
-
and
-
gravel
line
of
business
,
and
was
not
available
for
purposes
of
trespass
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
aunt
would
n't
hear
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
Supper
was
comfortably
served
and
hot
,
though
my
aunt
's
rooms
were
very
high
up
---
whether
that
she
might
have
more
stone
stairs
for
her
money
,
or
might
be
nearer
to
the
door
in
the
roof
,
I
do
n't
know
---
and
consisted
of
a
roast
fowl
,
a
steak
,
and
some
vegetables
,
to
all
of
which
I
did
ample
justice
,
and
which
were
all
excellent
.
<EOS>
But
my
aunt
had
her
own
ideas
concerning
London
provision
,
and
ate
but
little
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
this
unfortunate
fowl
was
born
and
brought
up
in
a
cellar
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
and
never
took
the
air
except
on
a
hackney
coach
-
stand
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
the
steak
may
be
beef
,
but
I
do
n't
believe
it
.
<EOS>
Nothing
's
genuine
in
the
place
,
in
my
opinion
,
but
the
dirt
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
think
the
fowl
may
have
come
out
of
the
country
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
I
hinted
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
returned
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
no
pleasure
to
a
London
tradesman
to
sell
anything
which
was
what
he
pretended
it
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
did
not
venture
to
controvert
this
opinion
,
but
I
made
a
good
supper
,
which
it
greatly
satisfied
her
to
see
me
do
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
table
was
cleared
,
Janet
assisted
her
to
arrange
her
hair
,
to
put
on
her
nightcap
,
which
was
of
a
smarter
construction
than
usual
(
"
in
case
of
fire
"
,
my
aunt
said
)
,
and
to
fold
her
gown
back
over
her
knees
,
these
being
her
usual
preparations
for
warming
herself
before
going
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
made
her
,
according
to
certain
established
regulations
from
which
no
deviation
,
however
slight
,
could
ever
be
permitted
,
a
glass
of
hot
wine
and
water
,
and
a
slice
of
toast
cut
into
long
thin
strips
.
 
<EOS>
With
these
accompaniments
we
were
left
alone
to
finish
the
evening
,
my
aunt
sitting
opposite
to
me
drinking
her
wine
and
water
;
soaking
her
strips
of
toast
in
it
,
one
by
one
,
before
eating
them
;
and
looking
benignantly
on
me
,
from
among
the
borders
of
her
nightcap
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Trot
,
"
she
began
,
"
what
do
you
think
of
the
proctor
plan
?
<EOS>
Or
have
you
not
begun
to
think
about
it
yet
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
thought
a
good
deal
about
it
,
my
dear
aunt
,
and
I
have
talked
a
good
deal
about
it
with
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
it
very
much
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
it
exceedingly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
cheering
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
one
difficulty
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Say
what
it
is
,
Trot
,
"
she
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
want
to
ask
,
aunt
,
as
this
seems
,
from
what
I
understand
,
to
be
a
limited
profession
,
whether
my
entrance
into
it
would
not
be
very
expensive
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
will
cost
,
"
returned
my
aunt
,
"
to
article
you
,
just
a
thousand
pounds
.

"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
dear
aunt
,
"
said
I
,
drawing
my
chair
nearer
,
"
I
am
uneasy
in
my
mind
about
that
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
large
sum
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
expended
a
great
deal
on
my
education
,
and
have
always
been
as
liberal
to
me
in
all
things
as
it
was
possible
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
been
the
soul
of
generosity
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
there
are
some
ways
in
which
I
might
begin
life
with
hardly
any
outlay
,
and
yet
begin
with
a
good
hope
of
getting
on
by
resolution
and
exertion
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
that
it
would
not
be
better
to
try
that
course
?
 
<EOS>
Are
you
certain
that
you
can
afford
to
part
with
so
much
money
,
and
that
it
is
right
that
it
should
be
so
expended
?
 
<EOS>
I
only
ask
you
,
my
second
mother
,
to
consider
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
certain
?
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
finished
eating
the
piece
of
toast
on
which
she
was
then
engaged
,
looking
me
full
in
the
face
all
the
while
;
and
then
setting
her
glass
on
the
chimney
-
piece
,
and
folding
her
hands
upon
her
folded
skirts
,
replied
as
follows
:
   
<EOS>
"
Trot
,
my
child
,
if
I
have
any
object
in
life
,
it
is
to
provide
for
your
being
a
good
,
a
sensible
,
and
a
happy
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
bent
upon
it
---
so
is
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
some
people
that
I
know
to
hear
Dick
's
conversation
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
Its
sagacity
is
wonderful
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
one
knows
the
resources
of
that
man
's
intellect
,
except
myself
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
stopped
for
a
moment
to
take
my
hand
between
hers
,
and
went
on
:
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
in
vain
,
Trot
,
to
recall
the
past
,
unless
it
works
some
influence
upon
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
might
have
been
better
friends
with
your
poor
father
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
might
have
been
better
friends
with
that
poor
child
your
mother
,
even
after
your
sister
Betsey
Trotwood
disappointed
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
came
to
me
,
a
little
runaway
boy
,
all
dusty
and
way
-
worn
,
perhaps
I
thought
so
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
time
until
now
,
Trot
,
you
have
ever
been
a
credit
to
me
and
a
pride
and
a
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
other
claim
upon
my
means
;
at
least
"
---
here
to
my
surprise
she
hesitated
,
and
was
confused
---
"
no
,
I
have
no
other
claim
upon
my
means
---
and
you
are
my
adopted
child
.
<EOS>
Only
be
a
loving
child
to
me
in
my
age
,
and
bear
with
my
whims
and
fancies
;
and
you
will
do
more
for
an
old
woman
whose
prime
of
life
was
not
so
happy
or
conciliating
as
it
might
have
been
,
than
ever
that
old
woman
did
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
I
had
heard
my
aunt
refer
to
her
past
history
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
magnanimity
in
her
quiet
way
of
doing
so
,
and
of
dismissing
it
,
which
would
have
exalted
her
in
my
respect
and
affection
,
if
anything
could
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
is
agreed
and
understood
between
us
,
now
,
Trot
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
and
we
need
talk
of
this
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
a
kiss
,
and
we
'll
go
to
the
Commons
after
breakfast
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
had
a
long
chat
by
the
fire
before
we
went
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
slept
in
a
room
on
the
same
floor
with
my
aunt
's
,
and
was
a
little
disturbed
in
the
course
of
the
night
by
her
knocking
at
my
door
as
often
as
she
was
agitated
by
a
distant
sound
of
hackney
-
coaches
or
market
-
carts
,
and
inquiring
,
"
if
I
heard
the
engines
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
But
towards
morning
she
slept
better
,
and
suffered
me
to
do
so
too
.
   
<EOS>
At
about
mid
-
day
,
we
set
out
for
the
office
of
Messrs
Spenlow
and
Jorkins
,
in
Doctors
'
Commons
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
who
had
this
other
general
opinion
in
reference
to
London
,
that
every
man
she
saw
was
a
pickpocket
,
gave
me
her
purse
to
carry
for
her
,
which
had
ten
guineas
in
it
and
some
silver
.
   
<EOS>
We
made
a
pause
at
the
toy
shop
in
Fleet
Street
,
to
see
the
giants
of
Saint
Dunstan
's
strike
upon
the
bells
---
we
had
timed
our
going
,
so
as
to
catch
them
at
it
,
at
twelve
o'clock
---
and
then
went
on
towards
Ludgate
Hill
,
and
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
crossing
to
the
former
place
,
when
I
found
that
my
aunt
greatly
accelerated
her
speed
,
and
looked
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
I
observed
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
a
lowering
ill
-
dressed
man
who
had
stopped
and
stared
at
us
in
passing
,
a
little
before
,
was
coming
so
close
after
us
as
to
brush
against
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trot
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Trot
!
"
cried
my
aunt
,
in
a
terrified
whisper
,
and
pressing
my
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
I
am
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
alarmed
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
.
<EOS>
Step
into
a
shop
,
and
I
'll
soon
get
rid
of
this
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
child
!
<EOS>
"
she
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
speak
to
him
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
entreat
,
I
order
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
Heaven
,
aunt
!
<EOS>
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
nothing
but
a
sturdy
beggar
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
what
he
is
!
"
replied
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
who
he
is
!
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
what
you
say
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
had
stopped
in
an
empty
door
-
way
,
while
this
was
passing
,
and
he
had
stopped
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
look
at
him
!
"
<EOS>
said
my
aunt
,
as
I
turned
my
head
indignantly
,
"
but
get
me
a
coach
,
my
dear
,
and
wait
for
me
in
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wait
for
you
?
"
<EOS>
I
replied
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
rejoined
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
go
with
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
him
,
aunt
?
 
<EOS>
This
man
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
in
my
senses
,
"
she
replied
,
"
and
I
tell
you
I
must
.
 
<EOS>
Get
mea
coach
!
"
   
<EOS>
However
much
astonished
I
might
be
,
I
was
sensible
that
I
had
no
right
to
refuse
compliance
with
such
a
peremptory
command
.
 
<EOS>
I
hurried
away
a
few
paces
,
and
called
a
hackney
-
chariot
which
was
passing
empty
.
 
<EOS>
Almost
before
I
could
let
down
the
steps
,
my
aunt
sprang
in
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
how
,
and
the
man
followed
.
 
<EOS>
She
waved
her
hand
to
me
to
go
away
,
so
earnestly
,
that
,
all
confounded
as
I
was
,
I
turned
from
them
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
In
doing
so
,
I
heard
her
say
to
the
coachman
,
"
Drive
anywhere
!
 
<EOS>
Drive
straight
on
!
"
<EOS>
and
presently
the
chariot
passed
me
,
going
up
the
hill
.
   
<EOS>
What
Mr
Dick
had
told
me
,
and
what
I
had
supposed
to
be
a
delusion
of
his
,
now
came
into
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
doubt
that
this
person
was
the
person
of
whom
he
had
made
such
mysterious
mention
,
though
what
the
nature
of
his
hold
upon
my
aunt
could
possibly
be
,
I
was
quite
unable
to
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
After
half
an
hour
's
cooling
in
the
churchyard
,
I
saw
the
chariot
coming
back
.
 
<EOS>
The
driver
stopped
beside
me
,
and
my
aunt
was
sitting
in
it
alone
.
   
<EOS>
She
had
not
yet
sufficiently
recovered
from
her
agitation
to
be
quite
prepared
for
the
visit
we
had
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
She
desired
me
to
get
into
the
chariot
,
and
to
tell
the
coachman
to
drive
slowly
up
and
down
a
little
while
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
no
more
,
except
,
<EOS>
"
My
dear
child
,
never
ask
me
what
it
was
,
and
do
n't
refer
to
it
,
"
until
she
had
perfectly
regained
her
composure
,
when
she
told
me
she
was
quite
herself
now
,
and
we
might
get
out
.
 
<EOS>
On
her
giving
me
her
purse
to
pay
the
driver
,
I
found
that
all
the
guineas
were
gone
,
and
only
the
loose
silver
remained
.
   
<EOS>
Doctors
'
Commons
was
approached
by
a
little
low
archway
.
 
<EOS>
Before
we
had
taken
many
paces
down
the
street
beyond
it
,
the
noise
of
the
city
seemed
to
melt
,
as
if
by
magic
,
into
a
softened
distance
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
dull
courts
and
narrow
ways
brought
us
to
the
sky
-
lighted
offices
of
Spenlow
and
Jorkins
;
in
the
vestibule
of
which
temple
,
accessible
to
pilgrims
without
the
ceremony
of
knocking
,
three
or
four
clerks
were
at
work
as
copyists
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
these
,
a
little
dry
man
,
sitting
by
himself
,
who
wore
a
stiff
brown
wig
that
looked
as
if
it
were
made
of
gingerbread
,
rose
to
receive
my
aunt
,
and
show
us
into
Mr
Spenlow
's
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
's
in
Court
,
ma'am
,
"
said
the
dry
man
;
"
it
's
an
Arches
day
;
but
it
's
close
by
,
and
I
'll
send
for
him
directly
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
we
were
left
to
look
about
us
while
Mr
Spenlow
was
fetched
,
I
availed
myself
of
the
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
The
furniture
of
the
room
was
old
-
fashioned
and
dusty
;
and
the
green
baize
on
the
top
of
the
writing
-
table
had
lost
all
its
colour
,
and
was
as
withered
and
pale
as
an
old
pauper
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
a
great
many
bundles
of
papers
on
it
,
some
endorsed
as
Allegations
,
and
some
(
to
my
surprise
)
as
Libels
,
and
some
as
being
in
the
Consistory
Court
,
and
some
in
the
Arches
Court
,
and
some
in
the
Prerogative
Court
,
and
some
in
the
Admiralty
Court
,
and
some
in
the
Delegates
'
Court
;
giving
me
occasion
to
wonder
much
,
how
many
Courts
there
might
be
in
the
gross
,
and
how
long
it
would
take
to
understand
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
these
,
there
were
sundry
immense
manuscript
Books
of
Evidence
taken
on
affidavit
,
strongly
bound
,
and
tied
together
in
massive
sets
,
a
set
to
each
cause
,
as
if
every
cause
were
a
history
in
ten
or
twenty
volumes
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
looked
tolerably
expensive
,
I
thought
,
and
gave
me
an
agreeable
notion
of
a
proctor
's
business
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
casting
my
eyes
with
increasing
complacency
over
these
and
many
similar
objects
,
when
hasty
footsteps
were
heard
in
the
room
outside
,
and
Mr
Spenlow
,
in
a
black
gown
trimmed
with
white
fur
,
came
hurrying
in
,
taking
off
his
hat
as
he
came
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
little
light
-
haired
gentleman
,
with
undeniable
boots
,
and
the
stiffest
of
white
cravats
and
shirt
-
collars
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
buttoned
up
,
mighty
trim
and
tight
,
and
must
have
taken
a
great
deal
of
pains
with
his
whiskers
,
which
were
accurately
curled
.
 
<EOS>
His
gold
watch
-
chain
was
so
massive
,
that
a
fancy
came
across
me
,
that
he
ought
to
have
a
sinewy
golden
arm
,
to
draw
it
out
with
,
like
those
which
are
put
up
over
the
goldbeaters
'
shops
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
got
up
with
such
care
,
and
was
so
stiff
,
that
he
could
hardly
bend
himself
;
being
obliged
,
when
he
glanced
at
some
papers
on
his
desk
,
after
sitting
down
in
his
chair
,
to
move
his
whole
body
,
from
the
bottom
of
his
spine
,
like
Punch
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
previously
been
presented
by
my
aunt
,
and
had
been
courteously
received
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
you
think
of
entering
into
our
profession
?
 
<EOS>
I
casually
mentioned
to
Miss
Trotwood
,
when
I
had
the
pleasure
of
an
interview
with
her
the
other
day
,
"
---
with
another
inclination
of
his
body
---
Punch
again
---
"
that
there
was
a
vacancy
here
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Trotwood
was
good
enough
to
mention
that
she
had
a
nephew
who
was
her
peculiar
care
,
and
for
whom
she
was
seeking
to
provide
genteelly
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
That
nephew
,
I
believe
,
I
have
now
the
pleasure
of
"
---
Punch
again
.
<EOS>
I
bowed
my
acknowledgements
,
and
said
,
my
aunt
had
mentioned
to
me
that
there
was
that
opening
,
and
that
I
believed
I
should
like
it
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
was
strongly
inclined
to
like
it
,
and
had
taken
immediately
to
the
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
could
not
absolutely
pledge
myself
to
like
it
,
until
I
knew
something
more
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
That
although
it
was
little
else
than
a
matter
of
form
,
I
presumed
I
should
have
an
opportunity
of
trying
how
I
liked
it
,
before
I
bound
myself
to
it
irrevocably
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
surely
!
<EOS>
surely
!
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
always
,
in
this
house
,
propose
a
month
---
an
initiatory
month
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
happy
,
myself
,
to
propose
two
months
---
three
---
an
indefinite
period
,
in
fact
---
<EOS>
but
I
have
a
partner

<EOS>
Mr
Jorkins
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
And
the
premium
,
sir
,
"
I
returned
,
"
is
a
thousand
pounds
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
the
premium
,
Stamp
included
,
is
a
thousand
pounds

"
said
Mr
Spenlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
I
have
mentioned
to
Miss
Trotwood
,
I
am
actuated
by
no
mercenary
considerations
;
few
men
are
less
so
,
I
believe
;
but
Mr
Jorkins
has
his
opinions
on
these
subjects
,
and
I
am
bound
to
respect
Mr
Jorkins
's
opinions
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jorkins
thinks
a
thousand
pounds
too
little
,
in
short
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
sir
,
"
said
I
,
still
desiring
to
spare
my
aunt
,
"
that
it
is
not
the
custom
here
,
if
an
articled
clerk
were
particularly
useful
,
and
made
himself
a
perfect
master
of
his
profession
"
---
I
could
not
help
blushing
<EOS>
,
this
looked
so
like
praising
myself
---
"
I
suppose
it
is
not
the
custom
,
in
the
later
years
of
his
time
,
to
allow
him
any
---
"
   
Mr
Spenlow
,
by
a
great
effort
,
just
lifted
his
head
far
enough
out
of
his
cravat
to
shake
it
,
and
answered
,
anticipating
the
word
"
salary
"
:
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
what
consideration
I
might
give
to
that
point
myself
,
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
if
I
were
unfettered
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jorkins
is
immovable
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
quite
dismayed
by
the
idea
of
this
terrible
Jorkins
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
found
out
afterwards
that
he
was
a
mild
man
of
a
heavy
temperament
,
whose
place
in
the
business
was
to
keep
himself
in
the
background
,
and
be
constantly
exhibited
by
name
as
the
most
obdurate
and
ruthless
of
men
.
 
<EOS>
If
a
clerk
wanted
his
salary
raised
,
Mr
Jorkins
would
n't
listen
to
such
a
proposition
.
 
<EOS>
If
a
client
were
slow
to
settle
his
bill
of
costs
,
Mr
Jorkins
was
resolved
to
have
it
paid
;
and
however
painful
these
things
might
be
(
and
always
were
)
to
the
feelings
of
Mr
Spenlow
,
Mr
Jorkins
would
have
his
bond
.
 
<EOS>
The
heart
and
hand
of
the
good
angel
Spenlow
would
have
been
always
open
,
but
for
the
restraining
demon
Jorkins
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
have
grown
older
,
I
think
I
have
had
experience
of
some
other
houses
doing
business
on
the
principle
of
Spenlow
and
Jorkins
!
   
<EOS>
It
was
settled
that
I
should
begin
my
month
's
probation
as
soon
as
I
pleased
,
and
that
my
aunt
need
neither
remain
in
town
nor
return
at
its
expiration
,
as
the
articles
of
agreement
,
of
which
I
was
to
be
the
subject
,
could
easily
be
sent
to
her
at
home
for
her
signature
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
had
got
so
far
,
Mr
Spenlow
offered
to
take
me
into
Court
then
and
there
,
and
show
me
what
sort
of
place
it
was
.
<EOS>
As
I
was
willing
enough
to
know
,
we
went
out
with
this
object
,
leaving
my
aunt
behind
;
who
would
trust
herself
,
she
said
,
in
no
such
place
,
and
who
,
I
think
,
regarded
all
Courts
of
Law
as
a
sort
of
powder
-
mills
that
might
blow
up
at
any
time
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
conducted
me
through
a
paved
courtyard
formed
of
grave
brick
houses
,
which
I
inferred
,
from
the
Doctors
'
names
upon
the
doors
,
to
be
the
official
abiding
-
places
of
the
learned
advocates
of
whom
Steerforth
had
told
me
;
and
into
a
large
dull
room
,
not
unlike
a
chapel
to
my
thinking
,
on
the
left
hand
.
 
<EOS>
The
upper
part
of
this
room
was
fenced
off
from
the
rest
;
and
there
,
on
the
two
sides
of
a
raised
platform
of
the
horse
-
shoe
form
,
sitting
on
easy
old
-
fashioned
dining
-
room
chairs
,
were
sundry
gentlemen
in
red
gowns
and
grey
wigs
,
whom
I
found
to
be
the
Doctors
aforesaid
.
<EOS>
Blinking
over
a
little
desk
like
a
pulpit
-
desk
,
in
the
curve
of
the
horse
-
shoe
,
was
an
old
gentleman
,
whom
,
if
I
had
seen
him
in
an
aviary
,
I
should
certainly
have
taken
for
an
owl
,
but
who
,
I
learned
,
was
the
presiding
judge
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
space
within
the
horse
-
shoe
,
lower
than
these
,
that
is
to
say
,
on
about
the
level
of
the
floor
,
were
sundry
other
gentlemen
,
of
Mr
Spenlow
's
rank
,
and
dressed
like
him
in
black
gowns
with
white
fur
upon
them
,
sitting
at
a
long
green
table
.
 
<EOS>
Their
cravats
were
in
general
stiff
,
I
thought
,
and
their
looks
haughty
;
but
in
this
last
respect
I
presently
conceived
I
had
done
them
an
injustice
,
for
when
two
or
three
of
them
had
to
rise
and
answer
a
question
of
the
presiding
dignitary
,
I
never
saw
anything
more
sheepish
.
 
<EOS>
The
public
,
represented
by
a
boy
with
a
comforter
,
and
a
shabby
-
genteel
man
secretly
eating
crumbs
out
of
his
coat
pockets
,
was
warming
itself
at
a
stove
in
the
centre
of
the
Court
.
 
<EOS>
The
languid
stillness
of
the
place
was
only
broken
by
the
chirping
of
this
fire
and
by
the
voice
of
one
of
the
Doctors
,
who
was
wandering
slowly
through
a
perfect
library
of
evidence
,
and
stopping
to
put
up
,
from
time
to
time
,
at
little
roadside
inns
of
argument
on
the
journey
.
<EOS>
Altogether
,
I
have
never
,
on
any
occasion
,
made
one
at
such
a
cosey
,
dosey
,
old
-
fashioned
,
time
-
forgotten
,
sleepy
-
headed
little
family
-
party
in
all
my
life
;
and
I
felt
it
would
be
quite
a
soothing
opiate
to
belong
to
it
in
any
character
---
except
perhaps
as
a
suitor
.
   
<EOS>
Very
well
satisfied
with
the
dreamy
nature
of
this
retreat
,
I
informed
Mr
Spenlow
that
I
had
seen
enough
for
that
time
,
and
we
rejoined
my
aunt
;
in
company
with
whom
I
presently
departed
from
the
Commons
,
feeling
very
young
when
I
went
out
of
Spenlow
and
Jorkins
's
,
on
account
of
the
clerks
poking
one
another
with
their
pens
to
point
me
out
.
   
<EOS>
We
arrived
at
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
without
any
new
adventures
,
except
encountering
an
unlucky
donkey
in
a
costermonger
's
cart
,
who
suggested
painful
associations
to
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
another
long
talk
about
my
plans
,
when
we
were
safely
housed
;
and
as
I
knew
she
was
anxious
to
get
home
,
and
,
between
fire
,
food
,
and
pickpockets
,
could
never
be
considered
at
her
ease
for
half
-
an
-
hour
in
London
,
I
urged
her
not
to
be
uncomfortable
on
my
account
,
but
to
leave
me
to
take
care
of
myself
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
been
here
a
week
tomorrow
,
without
considering
that
too
,
my
dear
,
"
she
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
furnished
little
set
of
chambers
to
be
let
in
the
Adelphi
,
Trot
,
which
ought
to
suit
you
to
a
marvel
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
brief
introduction
,
she
produced
from
her
pocket
an
advertisement
,
carefully
cut
out
of
a
newspaper
,
setting
forth
that
in
Buckingham
Street
in
the
Adelphi
there
was
to
be
let
furnished
,
with
a
view
of
the
river
,
a
singularly
desirable
,
and
compact
set
of
chambers
,
forming
a
genteel
residence
for
a
young
gentleman
,
a
member
of
one
of
the
Inns
of
Court
,
or
otherwise
,
with
immediate
possession
.
 
<EOS>
Terms
moderate
,
and
could
be
taken
for
a
month
only
,
if
required
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
this
is
the
very
thing
,
aunt
!
"
said
I
,
flushed
with
the
possible
dignity
of
living
in
chambers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
come
,
"
replied
my
aunt
,
immediately
resuming
the
bonnet
she
had
a
minute
before
laid
aside
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
'll
go
and
look
at
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
Away
we
went
.
 
<EOS>
The
advertisement
directed
us
to
apply
to
Mrs
Crupp
on
the
premises
,
and
we
rung
the
area
bell
,
which
we
supposed
to
communicate
with
Mrs
Crupp
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
we
had
rung
three
or
four
times
that
we
could
prevail
on
Mrs
Crupp
to
communicate
with
us
,
but
at
last
she
appeared
,
being
a
stout
lady
with
a
flounce
of
flannel
petticoat
below
a
nankeen
gown
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
us
see
these
chambers
of
yours
,
if
you
please
,
ma'am
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
this
gentleman
?
"
said
Mrs
Crupp
,
feeling
in
her
pocket
for
her
keys
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
for
my
nephew
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
a
sweet
set
they
is
for
sich
!
"
said
Mrs
Crupp
.
   
<EOS>
So
we
went
upstairs
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
on
the
top
of
the
house
---
a
great
point
with
my
aunt
,
being
near
the
fire
-
escape
---
and
consisted
of
a
little
half
-
blind
entry
where
you
could
see
hardly
anything
,
a
little
stone
-
blind
pantry
where
you
could
see
nothing
at
all
,
a
sitting
-
room
,
and
a
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
The
furniture
was
rather
faded
,
but
quite
good
enough
for
me
;
and
,
sure
enough
,
the
river
was
outside
the
windows
.
   
<EOS>
As
I
was
delighted
with
the
place
,
my
aunt
and
Mrs
Crupp
withdrew
into
the
pantry
to
discuss
the
terms
,
while
I
remained
on
the
sitting
-
room
sofa
,
hardly
daring
to
think
it
possible
that
I
could
be
destined
to
live
in
such
a
noble
residence
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
single
combat
of
some
duration
they
returned
,
and
I
saw
,
to
my
joy
,
both
in
Mrs
Crupp
's
countenance
and
in
my
aunt
's
,
that
the
deed
was
done
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
the
last
occupant
's
furniture
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
is
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mrs
Crupp
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
become
of
him
?
"
asked
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Crupp
was
taken
with
a
troublesome
cough
,
in
the
midst
of
which
she
articulated
with
much
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
took
ill
here
,
ma'am
,
and
---
ugh
!
<EOS>
ugh
!
<EOS>
ugh
!
<EOS>
dear
me
!
<EOS>
---
and
he
died
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hey
!
 
<EOS>
What
did
he
die
of
?
"
asked
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
,
he
died
of
drink
,
"
said
Mrs
Crupp
,
in
confidence
.
"
<EOS>
And
smoke
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Smoke
?
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
mean
chimneys
?
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
ma'am
,
"
returned
Mrs
Crupp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Cigars
and
pipes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
catching
,
Trot
,
at
any
rate
,
"
remarked
my
aunt
,
turning
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
In
short
,
my
aunt
,
seeing
how
enraptured
I
was
with
the
premises
,
took
them
for
a
month
,
with
leave
to
remain
for
twelve
months
when
that
time
was
out
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Crupp
was
to
find
linen
,
and
to
cook
;
every
other
necessary
was
already
provided
;
and
Mrs
Crupp
expressly
intimated
that
she
should
always
yearn
towards
me
as
a
son
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
take
possession
the
day
after
tomorrow
,
and
Mrs
Crupp
said
,
thank
Heaven
<EOS>
she
had
now
found
summun
she
could
care
for
!
   
<EOS>
On
our
way
back
,
my
aunt
informed
me
how
she
confidently
trusted
that
the
life
I
was
now
to
lead
would
make
me
firm
and
self
-
reliant
,
which
was
all
I
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
She
repeated
this
several
times
next
day
,
in
the
intervals
of
our
arranging
for
the
transmission
of
my
clothes
and
books
from
Mr
Wickfield
's
;
relative
to
which
,
and
to
all
my
late
holiday
,
I
wrote
a
long
letter
to
Agnes
,
of
which
my
aunt
took
charge
,
as
she
was
to
leave
on
the
succeeding
day
.
 
<EOS>
Not
to
lengthen
these
particulars
,
I
need
only
add
,
that
she
made
a
handsome
provision
for
all
my
possible
wants
during
my
month
of
trial
;
that
Steerforth
,
to
my
great
disappointment
and
hers
too
,
did
not
make
his
appearance
before
she
went
away
;
that
I
saw
her
safely
seated
in
the
Dover
coach
,
exulting
in
the
coming
discomfiture
of
the
vagrant
donkeys
,
with
Janet
at
her
side
;
and
that
when
the
coach
was
gone
,
I
turned
my
face
to
the
Adelphi
,
pondering
on
the
old
days
when
I
used
to
roam
about
its
subterranean
arches
,
and
on
the
happy
changes
which
had
brought
me
to
the
surface
.

Chapter

<EOS>
My
first
dissipation
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
wonderfully
fine
thing
to
have
that
lofty
castle
to
myself
,
and
to
feel
,
when
I
shut
my
outer
door
,
like
Robinson
Crusoe
,
when
he
had
got
into
his
fortification
,
and
pulled
his
ladder
up
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
wonderfully
fine
thing
to
walk
about
town
with
the
key
of
my
house
in
my
pocket
,
and
to
know
that
I
could
ask
any
fellow
to
come
home
,
and
make
quite
sure
of
its
being
inconvenient
to
nobody
,
if
it
were
not
so
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
wonderfully
fine
thing
to
let
myself
in
and
out
,
and
to
come
and
go
without
a
word
to
anyone
,
and
to
ring
Mrs
Crupp
up
,
gasping
,
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
,
<EOS>
when
I
wanted
her
---
and
when
she
was
disposed
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
,
I
say
,
was
wonderfully
fine
;
but
I
must
say
,
too
,
that
there
were
times
when
it
was
very
dreary
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
fine
in
the
morning
,
particularly
in
the
fine
mornings
.
 
<EOS>
It
looked
a
very
fresh
,
free
life
,
by
daylight
:
still
fresher
,
and
more
free
,
by
sunlight
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
the
day
declined
,
the
life
seemed
to
go
down
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
it
was
;
it
seldom
looked
well
by
candle
-
light
.
 
<EOS>
I
wanted
somebody
to
talk
to
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
missed
Agnes
.
<EOS>
I
found
a
tremendous
blank
,
in
the
place
of
that
smiling
repository
of
my
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Crupp
appeared
to
be
a
long
way
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
about
my
predecessor
,
who
had
died
of
drink
and
smoke
;
and
I
could
have
wished
he
had
been
so
good
as
to
live
,
and
not
bother
me
with
his
decease
.
   
<EOS>
After
two
days
and
nights
,
I
felt
as
if
I
had
lived
there
for
a
year
,
and
yet
I
was
not
an
hour
older
,
but
was
quite
as
much
tormented
by
my
own
youthfulness
as
ever
.
   
<EOS>
Steerforth
not
yet
appearing
,
which
induced
me
to
apprehend
that
he
must
be
ill
,
I
left
the
Commons
early
on
the
third
day
,
and
walked
out
to
Highgate
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Steerforth
was
very
glad
to
see
me
,
and
said
that
he
had
gone
away
with
one
of
his
Oxford
friends
to
see
another
who
lived
near
St
Albans
,
but
that
she
expected
him
to
return
tomorrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
fond
of
him
,
that
I
felt
quite
jealous
of
his
Oxford
friends
.
   
<EOS>
As
she
pressed
me
to
stay
to
dinner
,
I
remained
,
and
I
believe
we
talked
about
nothing
but
him
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
how
much
the
people
liked
him
at
Yarmouth
,
and
what
a
delightful
companion
he
had
been
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Dartle
was
full
of
hints
and
mysterious
questions
,
but
took
a
great
interest
in
all
our
proceedings
there
,
and
said
,
"
Was
it
really
though
?
"
<EOS>
and
so
forth
,
so
often
,
that
she
got
everything
out
of
me
<EOS>
she
wanted
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
Her
appearance
was
exactly
what
I
have
described
it
,
when
I
first
saw
her
;
but
the
society
of
the
two
ladies
was
so
agreeable
,
and
came
so
natural
to
me
,
that
I
felt
myself
falling
a
little
in
love
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
thinking
,
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
evening
,
and
particularly
when
I
walked
home
at
night
,
what
delightful
company
she
would
be
in
Buckingham
Street
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
taking
my
coffee
and
roll
in
the
morning
,
before
going
to
the
Commons
---
and
I
may
observe
in
this
place
that
it
is
surprising
how
much
coffee
Mrs
Crupp
used
,
and
how
weak
it
was
,
<EOS>
considering
---
when
Steerforth
himself
walked
in
,
to
my
unbounded
joy
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Steerforth
,
"
cried
I
,
"
<EOS>
I
began
to
think
I
should
never
see
you
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
carried
off
,
by
force
of
arms
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
"
the
very
next
morning
after
I
got
home
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Daisy
,
what
a
rare
old
bachelor
you
are
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
showed
him
over
the
establishment
,
not
omitting
the
pantry
,
with
no
little
pride
,
and
he
commended
it
highly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
,
old
boy
,
"
he
added
,
"
I
shall
make
quite
a
town
-
house
of
this
place
,
unless
you
give
me
notice
to
quit
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
a
delightful
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
if
he
waited
for
that
,
he
would
have
to
wait
till
doomsday
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
shall
have
some
breakfast
!
"
<EOS>
said
I
,
with
my
hand
on
the
bell
-
rope
,
"
and
Mrs
Crupp
shall
make
you
some
fresh
coffee
,
and
I
'll
toast
you
some
bacon
in
a
bachelor
's
Dutch
-
oven
,
that
I
have
got
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
!
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
ring
!
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
breakfast
with
one
of
these
fellows
who
is
at
the
Piazza
Hotel
,
in
Covent
Garden
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
'll
come
back
to
dinner
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
,
upon
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
I
should
like
better
,
but
I
must
remain
with
these
two
fellows
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
all
three
off
together
tomorrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
bring
them
here
to
dinner
,
"
I
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
they
would
come
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
they
would
come
fast
enough
,
"
said
Steerforth
;
"
but
we
should
inconvenience
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
better
come
and
dine
with
us
somewhere
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
would
not
by
any
means
consent
to
this
,
for
it
occurred
to
me
that
I
really
ought
to
have
a
little
house
-
warming
,
and
that
there
never
could
be
a
better
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
new
pride
in
my
rooms
after
his
approval
of
them
,
and
burned
with
a
desire
to
develop
their
utmost
resources
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
made
him
promise
positively
in
the
names
of
his
two
friends
,
and
we
appointed
six
o'clock
as
the
dinner
-
hour
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
was
gone
,
I
rang
for
Mrs
Crupp
,
and
acquainted
her
with
my
desperate
design
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Crupp
said
,
in
the
first
place
,
of
course
it
was
well
known
she
could
n't
be
expected
to
wait
,
but
she
knew
a
handy
young
man
,
who
she
thought
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
do
it
,
and
whose
terms
would
be
five
shillings
,
and
what
I
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
certainly
we
would
have
him
.
 
<EOS>
Next
Mrs
Crupp
said
it
was
clear
she
could
n't
be
in
two
places
at
once
(
which
I
felt
to
be
reasonable
)
,
and
that
"
a
young
gal
"
stationed
in
the
pantry
with
a
bedroom
candle
,
there
never
to
desist
from
washing
plates
,
would
be
indispensable
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
what
would
be
the
expense
of
this
young
female
?
<EOS>
and
Mrs
Crupp
said
she
supposed
eighteenpence
<EOS>
would
neither
make
me
nor
break
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
I
supposed
not
;
and
THAT
was
settled
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Mrs
Crupp
said
,
Now
about
the
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
remarkable
instance
of
want
of
forethought
on
the
part
of
the
ironmonger
who
had
made
Mrs
Crupp
's
kitchen
fireplace
,
that
it
was
capable
of
cooking
nothing
but
chops
and
mashed
potatoes
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
a
fish
-
kittle
,
Mrs
Crupp
said
,
well
!
<EOS>
would
I
only
come
and
look
at
the
range
?
 
<EOS>
She
could
n't
say
fairer
than
that
.
 
<EOS>
Would
I
come
and
look
at
it
?
 
<EOS>
As
I
should
not
have
been
much
the
wiser
if
I
HAD
looked
at
it
,
I
declined
,
and
said
,
"
Never
mind
fish
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Crupp
said
,
Do
n't
say
that
;
oysters
was
in
,
why
not
them
?
 
<EOS>
So
THAT
was
settled
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Crupp
then
said
what
she
would
recommend
would
be
this
.
 
<EOS>
A
pair
of
hot
roast
fowls
---
from
the
pastry
-
cook
's
;
a
dish
of
stewed
beef
,
with
vegetables
---
from
the
pastry
-
cook
's
;
two
little
corner
things
,
as
a
raised
pie
and
a
dish
of
kidneys
---
from
the
pastrycook
's
;
a
tart
,
and
(
if
I
liked
)
a
shape
of
jelly
---
from
the
pastrycook
's
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
Mrs
Crupp
said
,
would
leave
her
at
full
liberty
to
concentrate
her
mind
on
the
potatoes
,
and
to
serve
up
the
cheese
and
celery
as
she
could
wish
to
see
it
done
.
   
<EOS>
I
acted
on
Mrs
Crupp
's
opinion
,
and
gave
the
order
at
the
pastry
-
cook
's
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Walking
along
the
Strand
,
afterwards
,
and
observing
a
hard
mottled
substance
in
the
window
of
a
ham
and
beef
shop
,
which
resembled
marble
,
but
was
labelled
"
Mock
Turtle
"
,
I
went
in
and
bought
a
slab
of
it
,
which
I
have
since
seen
reason
to
believe
would
have
sufficed
for
fifteen
people
.
 
<EOS>
This
preparation
,
Mrs
Crupp
,
after
some
difficulty
,
consented
to
warm
up
;
and
it
shrunk
so
much
in
a
liquid
state
,
that
we
found
it
what
Steerforth
called
"
rather
a
tight
fit
"
for
four
.
   
<EOS>
These
preparations
happily
completed
,
I
bought
a
little
dessert
in
Covent
Garden
Market
,
and
gave
a
rather
extensive
order
at
a
retail
wine
-
merchant
's
in
that
vicinity
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
came
home
in
the
afternoon
,
and
saw
the
bottles
drawn
up
in
a
square
on
the
pantry
floor
,
they
looked
so
numerous
(
though
there
were
two
missing
,
which
made
Mrs
Crupp
very
uncomfortable
)
,
<EOS>
that
I
was
absolutely
frightened
at
them
.
   
<EOS>
One
of
Steerforth
's
friends
was
named
Grainger
,
and
the
other
Markham
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
both
very
gay
and
lively
fellows
;
Grainger
,
something
older
than
Steerforth
;
Markham
,
youthful
-
looking
,
and
I
should
say
not
more
than
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
I
observed
that
the
latter
always
spoke
of
himself
indefinitely
,
as
"
a
man
"
,
and
seldom
or
never
in
the
first
person
singular
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
man
might
get
on
very
well
here
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
said
Markham
---
meaning
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
a
bad
situation
,
"
said
I
,
"
and
the
rooms
are
really
commodious
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
both
brought
appetites
with
you
?
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
honour
,
"
returned
Markham
,
"
town
seems
to
sharpen
a
man
's
appetite
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
is
hungry
all
day
long
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
is
perpetually
eating
.
"
   
<EOS>
Being
a
little
embarrassed
at
first
,
and
feeling
much
too
young
to
preside
,
I
made
Steerforth
take
the
head
of
the
table
when
dinner
was
announced
,
and
seated
myself
opposite
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
was
very
good
;
we
did
not
spare
the
wine
;
and
he
exerted
himself
so
brilliantly
to
make
the
thing
pass
off
well
,
that
there
was
no
pause
in
our
festivity
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
quite
such
good
company
during
dinner
as
I
could
have
wished
to
be
<EOS>
,
for
my
chair
was
opposite
the
door
,
and
my
attention
was
distracted
by
observing
that
the
handy
young
man
went
out
of
the
room
very
often
,
and
that
his
shadow
always
presented
itself
,
immediately
afterwards
,
on
the
wall
of
the
entry
,
with
a
bottle
at
its
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
The
"
young
gal
"
likewise
occasioned
me
some
uneasiness
:
not
so
much
by
neglecting
to
wash
the
plates
,
as
by
breaking
them
.
 
<EOS>
For
being
of
an
inquisitive
disposition
,
and
unable
to
confine
herself
(
as
her
positive
instructions
were
)
to
the
pantry
,
she
was
constantly
peering
in
at
us
,
and
constantly
imagining
herself
detected
;
in
which
belief
,
she
several
times
retired
upon
the
plates
(
with
which
she
had
carefully
paved
the
floor
)
,
and
did
a
great
deal
of
destruction
.
   
<EOS>
These
,
however
,
were
small
drawbacks
,
and
easily
forgotten
when
the
cloth
was
cleared
,
and
the
dessert
put
on
the
table
;
at
which
period
of
the
entertainment
the
handy
young
man
was
discovered
to
be
speechless
.
 
<EOS>
Giving
him
private
directions
to
seek
the
society
of
Mrs
Crupp
,
and
to
remove
the
"
young
gal
"
to
the
basement
also
,
I
abandoned
myself
to
enjoyment
.
   
<EOS>
I
began
,
by
being
singularly
cheerful
and
light
-
hearted
;
all
sorts
of
half
-
forgotten
things
to
talk
about
,
came
rushing
into
my
mind
,
and
made
me
hold
forth
in
a
most
unwonted
manner
.
 
<EOS>
I
laughed
heartily
at
my
own
jokes
,
and
everybody
else
's
;
called
Steerforth
to
order
for
not
passing
the
wine
;
made
several
engagements
to
go
to
Oxford
;
announced
that
I
meant
to
have
a
dinner
-
party
exactly
like
that
,
once
a
week
,
until
further
notice
;
and
madly
took
so
much
snuff
out
of
Grainger
's
box
,
that
I
was
obliged
to
go
into
the
pantry
,
and
have
a
private
fit
of
sneezing
ten
minutes
long
.
   
<EOS>
I
went
on
,
by
passing
the
wine
faster
and
faster
yet
,
and
continually
starting
up
with
a
corkscrew
to
open
more
wine
,
long
before
any
was
needed
.
 
<EOS>
I
proposed
Steerforth
's
health
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
he
was
my
dearest
friend
,
the
protector
of
my
boyhood
,
and
the
companion
of
my
prime
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
I
was
delighted
to
propose
his
health
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
I
owed
him
more
obligations
than
I
could
ever
repay
,
and
held
him
in
a
higher
admiration
than
I
could
ever
express
.
 
<EOS>
I
finished
by
saying
,
"
I
'll
give
you
Steerforth
!
 
<EOS>
God
bless
him
!
 
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
<EOS>
"
We
gave
him
three
times
three
,
and
another
,
and
a
good
one
to
finish
with
.
 
<EOS>
I
broke
my
glass
in
going
round
the
table
to
shake
hands
with
him
,
and
I
said
(
in
two
words
)
<EOS>
"
Steerforth
---
you'retheguidingstarofmyexistence
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
went
on
,
by
finding
suddenly
that
somebody
was
in
the
middle
of
a
song
.
 
<EOS>
Markham
was
the
singer
,
and
he
sang
"
When
the
heart
of
a
man
is
depressed
with
care
"
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
when
he
had
sung
it
,
he
would
give
us
"
Woman
!
<EOS>
"
I
took
objection
to
that
,
and
I
could
n't
allow
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
it
was
not
a
respectful
way
of
proposing
the
toast
,
and
I
would
never
permit
that
toast
to
be
drunk
in
my
house
otherwise
than
as
"
The
Ladies
!
<EOS>
"
I
was
very
high
with
him
,
mainly
I
think
because
I
saw
Steerforth
and
Grainger
laughing
at
me
---
or
at
him
---
or
at
both
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
a
man
was
not
to
be
dictated
to
.
<EOS>
I
said
a
man
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
a
man
was
not
to
be
insulted
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
he
was
right
there
---
never
under
my
roof
,
where
the
Lares
were
sacred
,
and
the
laws
of
hospitality
paramount
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
it
was
no
derogation
from
a
man
's
dignity
to
confess
that
I
was
a
devilish
good
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
I
instantly
proposed
his
health
.
   
<EOS>
Somebody
was
smoking
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
all
smoking
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
smoking
,
and
trying
to
suppress
a
rising
tendency
to
shudder
.
 
<EOS>
Steerforth
had
made
a
speech
about
me
,
in
the
course
of
which
I
had
been
affected
almost
to
tears
.
 
<EOS>
I
returned
thanks
,
and
hoped
the
present
company
would
dine
with
me
tomorrow
,
and
the
day
after
---
each
day
at
five
o'clock
,
that
we
might
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
conversation
and
society
through
a
long
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
called
upon
to
propose
an
individual
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
give
them
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Betsey
Trotwood
,
the
best
of
her
sex
!
   
<EOS>
Somebody
was
leaning
out
of
my
bedroom
window
,
refreshing
his
forehead
against
the
cool
stone
of
the
parapet
,
and
feeling
the
air
upon
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
addressing
myself
as
"
Copperfield
"
,
and
saying
,
"
Why
did
you
try
to
smoke
?
 
<EOS>
You
might
have
known
you
could
n't
do
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Now
,
somebody
was
unsteadily
contemplating
his
features
in
the
looking
-
glass
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
I
too
.
<EOS>
I
was
very
pale
in
the
looking
-
glass
;
my
eyes
had
a
vacant
appearance
;
and
my
hair
---
only
my
hair
,
nothing
else
---
looked
drunk
.
   
<EOS>
Somebody
said
to
me
,
"
Let
us
go
to
the
theatre
,
Copperfield
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
There
was
no
bedroom
before
me
,
but
again
the
jingling
table
covered
with
glasses
;
the
lamp
;
<EOS>
Grainger
on
my
right
hand
,
Markham
on
my
left
,
and
Steerforth
opposite
---
all
sitting
in
a
mist
,
and
a
long
way
off
.
 
<EOS>
The
theatre
?
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Come
along
!
 
<EOS>
But
they
must
excuse
me
if
I
saw
everybody
out
first
,
and
turned
the
lamp
off
---
in
case
of
fire
.
   
<EOS>
Owing
to
some
confusion
in
the
dark
,
the
door
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
feeling
for
it
in
the
window
-
curtains
,
when
Steerforth
,
laughing
,
took
me
by
the
arm
and
led
me
out
.
 
<EOS>
We
went
downstairs
,
one
behind
another
.
 
<EOS>
Near
the
bottom
,
somebody
fell
,
and
rolled
down
.
<EOS>
Somebody
else
said
it
was
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
angry
at
that
false
report
,
until
,
finding
myself
on
my
back
in
the
passage
<EOS>
,
I
began
to
think
there
might
be
some
foundation
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
A
very
foggy
night
,
with
great
rings
round
the
lamps
in
the
streets
!
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
indistinct
talk
of
its
being
wet
.
 
<EOS>
I
considered
it
frosty
.
 
<EOS>
Steerforth
dusted
me
under
a
lamp
-
post
,
and
put
my
hat
into
shape
,
which
somebody
produced
from
somewhere
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
,
for
I
had
n't
had
it
on
before
.
<EOS>
Steerforth
then
said
,
"
You
are
all
right
,
Copperfield
,
are
you
not
?
"
<EOS>
and
I
told
him
,
"
Neverberrer
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
man
,
sitting
in
a
pigeon
-
hole
-
place
,
looked
out
of
the
fog
,
and
took
money
from
somebody
,
inquiring
if
I
was
one
of
the
gentlemen
paid
for
,
and
appearing
rather
doubtful
(
as
I
remember
in
the
glimpse
I
had
of
him
)
<EOS>
whether
to
take
the
money
for
me
or
not
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
we
were
very
high
up
in
a
very
hot
theatre
,
looking
down
into
a
large
pit
,
<EOS>
that
seemed
to
me
to
smoke
;
the
people
with
whom
it
was
crammed
were
so
indistinct
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
stage
,
too
,
looking
very
clean
and
smooth
after
the
streets
;
and
there
were
people
upon
it
,
talking
about
something
or
other
,
but
not
at
all
intelligibly
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
abundance
of
bright
lights
,
and
there
was
music
,
and
there
were
ladies
down
in
the
boxes
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
more
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
building
looked
to
me
as
if
it
were
learning
to
swim
;
it
conducted
itself
in
such
an
unaccountable
manner
,
when
I
tried
to
steady
it
.
   
<EOS>
On
somebody
's
motion
,
we
resolved
to
go
downstairs
to
the
dress
-
boxes
,
where
the
ladies
were
.
 
<EOS>
A
gentleman
lounging
,
<EOS>
full
dressed
,
on
a
sofa
,
with
an
opera
-
glass
in
his
hand
,
passed
before
my
view
,
and
also
my
own
figure
at
full
length
in
a
glass
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
was
being
ushered
into
one
of
these
boxes
,
and
found
myself
saying
something
as
I
sat
down
,
and
people
about
me
crying
"
Silence
!
"
<EOS>
to
somebody
,
and
ladies
casting
indignant
glances
at
me
,
and
---
what
!
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Agnes
,
sitting
on
the
seat
before
me
,
in
the
same
box
,
with
a
lady
and
gentleman
beside
her
,
whom
I
did
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
her
face
now
,
better
than
I
did
then
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
with
its
indelible
look
of
regret
and
wonder
turned
upon
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Agnes
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
thickly
,
"
Lorblessmer
!
 
<EOS>
Agnes
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
!
"
<EOS>
she
answered
,
I
could
not
conceive
why
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
disturb
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
the
stage
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
tried
,
on
her
injunction
,
to
fix
it
,
and
to
hear
something
of
what
was
going
on
there
,
but
quite
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
I
looked
at
her
again
by
and
by
,
and
saw
her
shrink
into
her
corner
,
and
put
her
gloved
hand
to
her
forehead
.
   
<EOS>
"
Agnes
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I'mafraidyou'renorwell
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
mind
me
,
Trotwood
,
"
she
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
Listen
!
 
<EOS>
Are
you
going
away
soon
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Amigoarawaysoo
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
had
a
stupid
intention
of
replying
that
I
was
going
to
wait
,
to
hand
her
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
expressed
it
,
somehow
;
for
after
she
had
looked
at
me
attentively
for
a
little
while
,
she
appeared
to
understand
,
and
replied
in
a
low
tone
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
will
do
as
I
ask
you
,
if
I
tell
you
I
am
very
earnest
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Go
away
now
,
Trotwood
,
for
my
sake
,
and
ask
your
friends
to
take
you
home
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
had
so
far
improved
me
,
for
the
time
,
that
though
I
was
angry
with
her
,
I
felt
ashamed
,
and
with
a
short
"
Goori
!
"
<EOS>
(
which
I
intended
for
"
Good
night
!
"
)
got
up
and
went
away
.
 
<EOS>
They
followed
,
and
I
stepped
at
once
out
of
the
box
-
door
into
my
bedroom
,
where
only
Steerforth
was
with
me
,
helping
me
to
undress
,
and
where
I
was
by
turns
telling
him
that
Agnes
was
my
sister
,
and
adjuring
him
to
bring
the
corkscrew
,
that
I
might
open
another
bottle
of
wine
.
   
<EOS>
How
somebody
,
lying
in
my
bed
,
lay
saying
and
doing
all
this
over
again
,
at
cross
purposes
,
in
a
feverish
dream
all
night
---
the
bed
a
rocking
sea
that
was
never
still
!
 
<EOS>
How
,
as
that
somebody
slowly
settled
down
into
myself
,
did
I
begin
to
parch
,
and
feel
as
if
my
outer
covering
of
skin
were
a
hard
board
;
my
tongue
the
bottom
of
an
empty
kettle
,
furred
with
long
service
,
and
burning
up
over
a
slow
fire
;
the
palms
of
my
hands
,
hot
plates
of
metal
which
no
ice
could
cool
!
   
<EOS>
But
the
agony
of
mind
,
the
remorse
,
and
shame
<EOS>
I
felt
when
I
became
conscious
next
day
!
 
<EOS>
My
horror
of
having
committed
a
thousand
offences
I
had
forgotten
,
and
which
nothing
could
ever
expiate
---
my
recollection
of
that
indelible
look
which
Agnes
had
given
me
---
the
torturing
impossibility
of
communicating
with
her
,
not
knowing
,
Beast
that
I
was
,
how
she
came
to
be
in
London
,
or
where
she
stayed
---
<EOS>
my
disgust
of
the
very
sight
of
the
room
where
the
revel
had
been
held
---
my
racking
head
---
the
smell
of
smoke
,
the
sight
of
glasses
,
the
impossibility
of
going
out
,
or
even
getting
up
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
a
day
it
was
!
   
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
an
evening
,
when
I
sat
down
by
my
fire
to
a
basin
of
mutton
broth
,
dimpled
all
over
with
fat
,
and
thought
I
was
going
the
way
of
my
predecessor
,
and
should
succeed
to
his
dismal
story
as
well
as
to
his
chambers
,
and
had
half
a
mind
to
rush
express
to
Dover
and
reveal
all
!
 
<EOS>
What
an
evening
,
when
Mrs
Crupp
,
coming
in
to
take
away
the
broth
-
basin
,
produced
one
kidney
on
a
cheese
-
plate
as
the
entire
remains
of
yesterday
's
feast
,
and
I
was
really
inclined
to
fall
upon
her
nankeen
breast
and
say
,
in
heartfelt
penitence
,
"
Oh
,
Mrs
Crupp
,
Mrs
Crupp
,
never
mind
the
broken
meats
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
miserable
!
"
<EOS>
---
only
that
I
doubted
,
even
at
that
pass
,
if
Mrs
Crupp
were
quite
the
sort
of
woman
to
confide
in
!

<EOS>
Good
and
bad
angels
 
<EOS>
I
was
going
out
at
my
door
on
the
morning
after
that
deplorable
day
of
headache
,
sickness
,
and
repentance
,
with
an
odd
confusion
in
my
mind
relative
to
the
date
of
my
dinner
-
party
,
as
if
a
body
of
Titans
had
taken
an
enormous
lever
and
pushed
the
day
before
yesterday
some
months
back
,
when
I
saw
a
ticket
-
porter
coming
upstairs
,
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
taking
his
time
about
his
errand
,
then
;
but
when
he
saw
me
on
the
top
of
the
staircase
,
looking
at
him
over
the
banisters
,
he
swung
into
a
trot
,
and
came
up
panting
as
if
he
had
run
himself
into
a
state
of
exhaustion
.
   
<EOS>
"
T
Copperfield
,
Esquire
,
"
said
the
ticket
-
porter
,
touching
his
hat
with
his
little
cane
.
   
<EOS>
I
could
scarcely
lay
claim
to
the
name
:
<EOS>
I
was
so
disturbed
by
the
conviction
that
the
letter
came
from
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
told
him
I
was
T
Copperfield
,
Esquire
,
and
he
believed
it
,
and
gave
me
the
letter
,
which
he
said
required
an
answer
.
 
<EOS>
I
shut
him
out
on
the
landing
to
wait
for
the
answer
,
and
went
into
my
chambers
again
,
in
such
a
nervous
state
that
I
was
fain
to
lay
the
letter
down
on
my
breakfast
table
,
and
familiarize
myself
with
the
outside
of
it
a
little
,
before
I
could
resolve
to
break
the
seal
.
   
<EOS>
I
found
,
when
I
did
open
it
,
that
it
was
a
very
kind
note
,
containing
no
reference
to
my
condition
at
the
theatre
.
 
<EOS>
All
it
said
was
,
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Trotwood
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
staying
at
the
house
of
papa
's
agent
,
Mr
Waterbrook
,
in
Ely
Place
,
Holborn
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
come
and
see
me
today
,
at
any
time
you
like
to
appoint
?
 
<EOS>
Ever
yours
affectionately
,
AGNES
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
took
me
such
a
long
time
to
write
an
answer
at
all
to
my
satisfaction
,
that
I
do
n't
know
what
the
ticket
-
porter
can
have
thought
,
unless
he
thought
I
was
learning
to
write
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
written
half
-
a
-
dozen
answers
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
I
began
one
,
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
ever
hope
,
my
dear
Agnes
,
to
efface
from
your
remembrance
the
disgusting
impression
"
---
there
I
did
n't
like
it
,
and
then
I
tore
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
began
another
,
"
Shakespeare
has
observed
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Agnes
,
how
strange
it
is
that
a
man
should
put
an
enemy
into
his
mouth
"
---
that
reminded
me
of
Markham
,
and
it
got
no
farther
.
 
<EOS>
I
even
tried
poetry
.
 
<EOS>
I
began
one
note
,
in
a
six
-
syllable
line
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
do
not
remember
"
---
but
that
associated
itself
with
the
fifth
of
November
,
and
became
an
absurdity
.
 
<EOS>
After
many
attempts
,
I
wrote
,
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
Your
letter
is
like
you
,
and
what
could
I
say
of
it
that
would
be
higher
praise
than
that
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
come
at
four
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Affectionately
and
sorrowfully
,
T*C.
<EOS>
"
 
With
this
missive
(
which
I
was
in
twenty
minds
at
once
about
recalling
,
as
soon
as
it
was
out
of
my
hands
)
,
the
ticket
-
porter
at
last
departed
.
   
<EOS>
If
the
day
were
half
as
tremendous
to
any
other
professional
gentleman
in
Doctors
'
Commons
as
it
was
to
me
,
I
sincerely
believe
he
made
some
expiation
for
his
share
in
that
rotten
old
ecclesiastical
cheese
.
 
<EOS>
Although
I
left
the
office
at
half
past
three
,
and
was
prowling
about
the
place
of
appointment
within
a
few
minutes
afterwards
,
the
appointed
time
was
exceeded
by
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
,
according
to
the
clock
of
St
Andrew
's
,
Holborn
,
before
I
could
muster
up
sufficient
desperation
to
pull
the
private
bell
-
handle
<EOS>
let
into
the
left
-
hand
door
-
post
of
Mr
Waterbrook
's
house
.
   
<EOS>
The
professional
business
of
Mr
Waterbrook
's
establishment
was
done
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
and
the
genteel
business
(
of
which
there
was
a
good
deal
)
in
the
upper
part
of
the
building
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
shown
into
a
pretty
but
rather
close
drawing
-
room
,
and
there
sat
Agnes
,
netting
a
purse
.
   
<EOS>
She
looked
so
quiet
and
good
,
and
reminded
me
so
strongly
of
my
airy
fresh
school
days
at
Canterbury
,
and
the
sodden
,
smoky
,
stupid
wretch
I
had
been
the
other
night
,
that
,
nobody
being
by
<EOS>
,
I
yielded
to
my
self
-
reproach
and
shame
,
and
---
in
short
,
made
a
fool
of
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
deny
that
I
shed
tears
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
hour
I
am
undecided
whether
it
was
upon
the
whole
the
wisest
thing
I
could
have
done
,
or
the
most
ridiculous
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
had
been
anyone
but
you
,
Agnes
,
"
said
I
,
turning
away
my
head
,
"
I
should
not
have
minded
it
half
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
it
should
have
been
you
who
saw
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
almost
wish
I
had
been
dead
,
first
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
put
her
hand
<EOS>
---
its
touch
was
like
no
other
hand
---
upon
my
arm
for
a
moment
;
and
I
felt
so
befriended
and
comforted
,
that
I
could
not
help
moving
it
to
my
lips
,
and
gratefully
kissing
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
"
said
Agnes
,
cheerfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
unhappy
,
Trotwood
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
not
confidently
trust
me
,
whom
will
you
trust
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Agnes
!
"
I
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
my
good
Angel
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
smiled
rather
sadly
,
I
thought
,
and
shook
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Agnes
,
my
good
Angel
!
 
<EOS>
Always
my
good
Angel
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
,
indeed
,
Trotwood
,
"
she
returned
,
"
there
is
one
thing
that
I
should
set
my
heart
on
very
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
looked
at
her
inquiringly
;
but
already
with
a
foreknowledge
of
her
meaning
.
   
<EOS>
"
On
warning
you
,
"
said
Agnes
,
with
a
steady
glance
,
"
against
your
bad
Angel
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Agnes
,
"
I
began
,
"
<EOS>
if
you
mean
Steerforth
---
"
   
"
I
do
,
Trotwood
<EOS>
,
"
she
returned
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
Agnes
,
you
wrong
him
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
He
<EOS>
my
bad
Angel
,
or
anyone
's
!
 
<EOS>
He
,
anything
but
a
guide
,
a
support
,
and
a
friend
to
me
!
<EOS>
My
dear
Agnes
!
 
<EOS>
Now
,
is
it
not
unjust
,
and
unlike
you
,
to
judge
him
from
what
you
saw
of
me
the
other
night
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
judge
him
from
what
I
saw
of
you
the
other
night
,
"
she
quietly
replied
.
   
<EOS>
"
From
what
,
then
?
"
   
"
From
many
things
---
trifles
in
themselves
,
but
they
do
not
seem
to
me
to
be
so
,
when
they
are
put
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
judge
him
,
partly
from
your
account
of
him
,
Trotwood
,
and
your
character
,
and
the
influence
he
has
over
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
always
something
in
her
modest
voice
that
seemed
to
touch
a
chord
within
me
,
answering
to
that
sound
alone
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
always
earnest
;
but
when
it
was
very
earnest
,
as
it
was
now
,
there
was
a
thrill
in
it
that
quite
subdued
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
looking
at
her
as
she
cast
her
eyes
down
on
her
work
;
I
sat
seeming
still
to
listen
to
her
;
and
Steerforth
,
in
spite
of
all
my
attachment
to
him
,
darkened
in
that
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
bold
in
me
,
"
said
Agnes
,
looking
up
again
,
"
who
have
lived
in
such
seclusion
,
and
can
know
so
little
of
the
world
,
to
give
you
my
advice
so
confidently
,
or
even
to
have
this
strong
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
know
in
what
it
is
engendered
,
Trotwood
,
---
in
how
true
a
remembrance
of
our
having
grown
up
together
,
and
in
how
true
an
interest
in
all
relating
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
that
which
makes
me
bold
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
certain
that
what
I
say
is
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
sure
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
it
were
someone
else
speaking
to
you
,
and
not
I
,
when
I
caution
you
that
you
have
made
a
dangerous
friend
.
"
   
<EOS>
Again
I
looked
at
her
,
again
I
listened
to
her
after
she
was
silent
,
and
again
his
image
,
though
it
was
still
fixed
in
my
heart
,
darkened
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
so
unreasonable
as
to
expect
,
"
said
Agnes
,
resuming
her
usual
tone
,
after
a
little
while
,
"
that
you
will
,
or
that
you
can
,
at
once
,
change
any
sentiment
that
has
become
a
conviction
to
you
;
least
of
all
a
sentiment
that
is
rooted
in
your
trusting
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
You
ought
not
hastily
to
do
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
ask
you
,
Trotwood
,
if
you
ever
think
of
me
---
I
mean
,
"
with
a
quiet
smile
,
for
I
was
going
to
interrupt
her
,
and
she
knew
why
,
"
as
often
as
you
think
of
me
---
to
think
of
what
I
have
said
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
forgive
me
for
all
this
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
forgive
you
,
Agnes
,
"
I
replied
,
"
when
you
come
to
do
Steerforth
justice
,
and
to
like
him
as
well
as
I
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
until
then
?
"
said
Agnes
.
   
<EOS>
I
saw
a
passing
shadow
on
her
face
when
I
made
this
mention
of
him
,
but
she
returned
my
smile
,
and
we
were
again
as
unreserved
in
our
mutual
confidence
as
of
old
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
,
Agnes
,
"
said
I
,
"
will
you
forgive
me
the
other
night
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
recall
it
,
"
said
Agnes
.
   
<EOS>
She
would
have
dismissed
the
subject
so
,
but
I
was
too
full
of
it
to
allow
that
,
and
insisted
on
telling
her
how
it
happened
that
I
had
disgraced
myself
,
and
what
chain
of
accidental
circumstances
had
had
the
theatre
for
its
final
link
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
relief
to
me
to
do
this
,
and
to
enlarge
on
the
obligation
that
I
owed
to
Steerforth
for
his
care
of
me
when
I
was
unable
to
take
care
of
myself
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
forget
,
"
said
Agnes
,
calmly
changing
the
conversation
as
soon
as
I
had
concluded
,
"
that
you
are
always
to
tell
me
,
not
only
when
you
fall
into
trouble
,
but
when
you
fall
in
love
.
 
<EOS>
Who
has
succeeded
to
Miss
Larkins
,
Trotwood
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
one
,
Agnes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Someone
,
Trotwood
,
"
said
Agnes
,
laughing
,
and
holding
up
her
finger
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Agnes
,
upon
my
word
!
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
lady
,
certainly
,
at
Mrs
Steerforth
's
house
,
who
is
very
clever
,
and
whom
I
like
to
talk
to
---
Miss
Dartle
---
but
I
do
n't
adore
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
Agnes
laughed
again
at
her
own
penetration
,
and
told
me
that
if
I
were
faithful
to
her
in
my
confidence
she
thought
she
should
keep
a
little
register
of
my
violent
attachments
,
with
the
date
,
duration
,
and
termination
of
each
,
like
the
table
of
the
reigns
of
the
kings
and
queens
,
in
the
History
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
asked
me
if
I
had
seen
Uriah
.
   
<EOS>
"
Uriah
Heep
?
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
 
Is
he
in
London
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
comes
to
the
office
downstairs
,
every
day
,
"
returned
Agnes
.
<EOS>
"
He
was
in
London
a
week
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
on
disagreeable
business
,
Trotwood
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
some
business
that
makes
you
uneasy
,
Agnes
,
I
see
,
"
said
I.
<EOS>
"
What
can
that
be
?
"
   
<EOS>
Agnes
laid
aside
her
work
,
and
replied
,
folding
her
hands
upon
one
another
,
and
looking
pensively
at
me
out
of
those
beautiful
soft
eyes
of
hers
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
he
is
going
to
enter
into
partnership
with
papa
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
?
 
Uriah
?
 
<EOS>
That
mean
,
fawning
fellow
,
worm
himself
into
such
promotion
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
,
indignantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
made
no
remonstrance
about
it
,
Agnes
?
 
<EOS>
Consider
what
a
connexion
it
is
likely
to
be
.
<EOS>
You
must
speak
out
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
allow
your
father
to
take
such
a
mad
step
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
prevent
it
,
Agnes
,
while
there
's
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
Still
looking
at
me
,
Agnes
shook
her
head
while
I
was
speaking
,
with
a
faint
smile
at
my
warmth
:
and
then
replied
:
   
"
<EOS>
You
remember
our
last
conversation
about
papa
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
long
after
that
---
not
more
than
two
or
three
days
---
when
he
gave
me
the
first
intimation
of
what
I
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
sad
to
see
him
struggling
between
his
desire
to
represent
it
to
me
as
a
matter
of
choice
on
his
part
,
and
his
inability
to
conceal
that
it
was
forced
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
very
sorry
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Forced
upon
him
,
Agnes
!
 
<EOS>
Who
forces
it
upon
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Uriah
,
"
she
replied
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
"
has
made
himself
indispensable
to
papa
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
subtle
and
watchful
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
mastered
papa
's
weaknesses
,
fostered
them
,
and
taken
advantage
of
them
,
until
---
to
say
all
that
I
mean
in
a
word
,
Trotwood
,
---
until
papa
is
afraid
of
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
more
that
she
might
have
said
;
more
that
she
knew
,
or
that
she
suspected
;
I
clearly
saw
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
give
her
pain
by
asking
what
it
was
,
for
I
knew
that
she
withheld
it
from
me
,
to
spare
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
long
been
going
on
to
this
,
I
was
sensible
:
<EOS>
yes
,
I
could
not
but
feel
,
on
the
least
reflection
,
that
it
had
been
going
on
to
this
for
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
remained
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
ascendancy
over
papa
,
"
said
Agnes
,
"
is
very
great
.
 
<EOS>
He
professes
humility
and
gratitude
---
with
truth
,
perhaps
:
I
hope
so
---
but
his
position
is
really
one
of
power
,
and
I
fear
he
makes
a
hard
use
of
his
power
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
said
he
was
a
hound
,
which
,
at
the
moment
,
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
the
time
I
speak
of
,
as
the
time
when
papa
spoke
to
me
,
"
pursued
Agnes
,
"
he
had
told
papa
that
he
was
going
away
;
that
he
was
very
sorry
,
and
unwilling
to
leave
,
but
that
he
had
better
prospects
.
 
<EOS>
Papa
was
very
much
depressed
then
,
and
more
bowed
down
by
care
than
ever
you
or
<EOS>
I
have
seen
him
;
but
he
seemed
relieved
by
this
expedient
of
the
partnership
,
though
at
the
same
time
he
seemed
hurt
by
it
and
ashamed
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
how
did
you
receive
it
,
Agnes
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
Trotwood
,
"
she
replied
,
"
what
I
hope
was
right
.
 
<EOS>
Feeling
sure
that
it
was
necessary
for
papa
's
peace
that
the
sacrifice
should
be
made
,
I
entreated
him
to
make
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
it
would
lighten
the
load
of
his
life
<EOS>
---
I
hope
it
will
!
<EOS>
---
and
that
it
would
give
me
increased
opportunities
of
being
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Trotwood
!
"
cried
Agnes
,
putting
her
hands
before
her
face
,
as
her
tears
started
on
it
,
"
<EOS>
I
almost
feel
as
if
I
had
been
papa
's
enemy
,
instead
of
his
loving
child
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
know
how
he
has
altered
,
in
his
devotion
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
how
he
has
narrowed
the
circle
of
his
sympathies
and
duties
,
in
the
concentration
of
his
whole
mind
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
a
multitude
of
things
he
has
shut
out
for
my
sake
,
and
how
his
anxious
thoughts
of
me
have
shadowed
his
life
,
and
weakened
his
strength
and
energy
,
by
turning
them
always
upon
one
idea
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
could
ever
set
this
right
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
could
ever
work
out
his
restoration
,
as
I
have
so
innocently
been
the
cause
of
his
decline
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
had
never
before
seen
Agnes
cry
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
seen
tears
in
her
eyes
when
I
had
brought
new
honours
home
from
school
,
and
I
had
seen
them
there
when
we
last
spoke
about
her
father
,
and
I
had
seen
her
turn
her
gentle
head
aside
when
we
took
leave
of
one
another
;
but
I
had
never
seen
her
grieve
like
this
.
 
<EOS>
It
made
me
so
sorry
that
I
could
only
say
,
in
a
foolish
,
helpless
manner
,
"
Pray
,
Agnes
,
do
n't
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
,
my
dear
sister
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
Agnes
was
too
superior
to
me
in
character
and
purpose
,
as
I
know
well
now
,
whatever
I
might
know
or
not
know
then
,
to
be
long
in
need
of
my
entreaties
.
 
<EOS>
The
beautiful
,
calm
manner
,
which
makes
her
so
different
in
my
remembrance
from
everybody
else
,
came
back
again
,
as
if
a
cloud
had
passed
from
a
serene
sky
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
not
likely
to
remain
alone
much
longer
,
"
said
Agnes
,
"
and
while
I
have
an
opportunity
,
let
me
earnestly
entreat
you
,
Trotwood
,
to
be
friendly
to
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
repel
him
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
resent
(
as
I
think
you
have
a
general
disposition
to
do
)
<EOS>
what
may
be
uncongenial
to
you
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
not
deserve
it
,
for
we
know
no
certain
ill
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
In
any
case
,
think
first
of
papa
and
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Agnes
had
no
time
to
say
more
,
for
the
room
door
opened
,
and
Mrs
Waterbrook
,
who
was
a
large
lady
---
or
who
wore
a
large
dress
:
<EOS>
I
do
n't
exactly
know
which
,
for
I
do
n't
know
which
was
dress
and
which
was
lady
---
came
sailing
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
dim
recollection
of
having
seen
her
at
the
theatre
,
as
if
I
had
seen
her
in
a
pale
magic
lantern
;
but
she
appeared
to
remember
me
perfectly
,
and
still
to
suspect
me
of
being
in
a
state
of
intoxication
.
   
<EOS>
Finding
by
degrees
,
however
,
that
I
was
sober
,
and
(
I
hope
)
<EOS>
that
I
was
a
modest
young
gentleman
<EOS>
,
Mrs
Waterbrook
softened
towards
me
considerably
,
and
inquired
,
firstly
,
if
I
went
much
into
the
parks
,
and
secondly
,
if
I
went
much
into
society
.
 
<EOS>
On
my
replying
to
both
these
questions
in
the
negative
,
it
occurred
to
me
that
I
fell
again
in
her
good
opinion
;
but
she
concealed
the
fact
gracefully
,
and
invited
me
to
dinner
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
accepted
the
invitation
,
and
took
my
leave
,
making
a
call
on
Uriah
in
the
office
as
I
went
out
,
and
leaving
a
card
for
him
in
his
absence
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
went
to
dinner
next
day
,
and
on
the
street
door
being
opened
,
plunged
into
a
vapour
-
bath
of
haunch
of
mutton
,
I
divined
that
I
was
not
the
only
guest
,
for
I
immediately
identified
the
ticket
-
porter
in
disguise
,
assisting
the
family
servant
,
and
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
to
carry
up
my
name
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
,
to
the
best
of
his
ability
,
when
he
asked
me
for
it
confidentially
,
as
if
he
had
never
seen
me
before
;
but
well
did
I
know
him
,
and
well
did
he
know
me
.
 
<EOS>
Conscience
made
cowards
of
us
both
.
   
<EOS>
I
found
Mr
Waterbrook
to
be
a
middle
-
aged
gentleman
,
with
a
short
throat
,
and
a
good
deal
of
shirt
-
collar
,
who
only
wanted
a
black
nose
to
be
the
portrait
of
a
pug
-
dog
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
he
was
happy
to
have
the
honour
of
making
my
acquaintance
;
and
when
I
had
paid
my
homage
to
Mrs
Waterbrook
,
presented
me
,
with
much
ceremony
,
to
a
very
awful
lady
in
a
black
velvet
dress
,
and
a
great
black
velvet
hat
,
whom
I
remember
as
looking
like
a
near
relation
of
Hamlet
's
---
say
his
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Henry
Spiker
was
this
lady
's
name
;
and
her
husband
was
there
too
:
<EOS>
so
cold
a
man
,
that
his
head
,
instead
of
being
grey
,
seemed
to
be
sprinkled
with
hoar
-
frost
.
 
<EOS>
Immense
deference
was
shown
to
the
Henry
Spikers
,
male
and
female
;
which
Agnes
told
me
was
on
account
of
Mr
Henry
Spiker
being
solicitor
to
something
Or
to
Somebody
<EOS>
,
I
forget
what
or
which
,
remotely
connected
with
the
Treasury
.
   
<EOS>
I
found
Uriah
Heep
among
the
company
,
in
a
suit
of
black
,
and
in
deep
humility
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
,
when
I
shook
hands
with
him
,
that
he
was
proud
to
be
noticed
by
me
,
and
that
he
really
felt
obliged
to
me
for
my
condescension
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
wished
he
had
been
less
obliged
to
me
,
for
he
hovered
about
me
in
his
gratitude
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
;
and
<EOS>
whenever
I
said
a
word
to
Agnes
,
was
sure
,
with
his
shadowless
eyes
and
cadaverous
face
,
to
be
looking
gauntly
down
upon
us
from
behind
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
other
guests
---
all
iced
for
the
occasion
,
as
it
struck
me
,
like
the
wine
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
one
who
attracted
my
attention
before
he
came
in
,
on
account
of
my
hearing
<EOS>
him
announced
as
Mr
Traddles
!
 
<EOS>
My
mind
flew
back
to
Salem
House
;
and
could
it
be
Tommy
,
I
thought
,
who
used
to
draw
the
skeletons
!
   
<EOS>
I
looked
for
Mr
Traddles
with
unusual
interest
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
sober
,
steady
-
looking
young
man
of
retiring
manners
,
with
a
comic
head
of
hair
,
and
eyes
that
were
rather
wide
open
;
and
he
got
into
an
obscure
corner
so
soon
,
that
I
had
some
difficulty
in
making
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
I
had
a
good
view
of
him
,
and
either
my
vision
deceived
me
,
or
it
was
the
old
unfortunate
Tommy
.
   
<EOS>
I
made
my
way
to
Mr
Waterbrook
,
and
said
,
that
I
believed
I
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
an
old
schoolfellow
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
said
Mr
Waterbrook
,
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
too
young
to
have
been
at
school
with
Mr
Henry
Spiker
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
mean
him
!
<EOS>
"
I
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
the
gentleman
named
Traddles
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Aye
,
aye
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
!
"
said
my
host
,
with
much
diminished
interest
.
 
<EOS>
"
Possibly
.
"
   
"
If
it
's
really
the
same
person
,
"
said
I
,
glancing
towards
him
,
"
it
was
at
a
place
called
Salem
House
where
we
were
together
,
and
he
was
an
excellent
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
is
a
good
fellow
,
"
returned
my
host
nodding
his
head
with
an
air
of
toleration
.
 
<EOS>
"
Traddles
is
quite
a
good
fellow
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
curious
coincidence
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
really
,
"
returned
my
host
,
"
quite
a
coincidence
,
that
Traddles
should
be
here
at
all
:
as
Traddles
was
only
invited
this
morning
,
when
the
place
at
table
,
intended
to
be
occupied
by
Mrs
Henry
Spiker
's
brother
,
became
vacant
,
in
consequence
of
his
indisposition
.
 
<EOS>
A
very
gentlemanly
man
,
Mrs
Henry
Spiker
's
brother
,
Mr
Copperfield
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
murmured
an
assent
,
which
was
full
of
feeling
,
considering
that
I
knew
nothing
at
all
about
him
;
and
I
inquired
what
Mr
Traddles
was
by
profession
.
   
<EOS>
"
Traddles
,
"
returned
Mr
Waterbrook
,
"
is
a
young
man
reading
for
the
bar
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
quite
a
good
fellow
---
<EOS>
nobody
's
enemy
but
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
his
own
enemy
?
"
<EOS>
said
I
,
sorry
to
hear
this
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
returned
Mr
Waterbrook
,
pursing
up
his
mouth
,
and
playing
with
his
watch
-
chain
,
in
a
comfortable
,
prosperous
sort
of
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
stand
in
their
own
light
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
should
say
he
would
never
,
for
example
,
be
worth
five
hundred
pound
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
was
recommended
to
me
by
a
professional
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
yes
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
kind
of
talent
for
drawing
briefs
,
and
stating
a
case
in
writing
,
plainly
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
able
to
throw
something
in
Traddles
's
way
,
in
the
course
of
the
year
;
something
---
for
him
---
considerable
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
yes
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
much
impressed
by
the
extremely
comfortable
and
satisfied
manner
in
which
Mr
Waterbrook
delivered
himself
of
this
little
word
"
<EOS>
Yes
"
,
every
now
and
then
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
wonderful
expression
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
completely
conveyed
the
idea
of
a
man
who
had
been
born
,
not
to
say
with
a
silver
spoon
,
but
with
a
scaling
-
ladder
,
and
had
gone
on
mounting
all
the
heights
of
life
one
after
another
,
until
now
he
looked
,
from
the
top
of
the
fortifications
,
with
the
eye
of
a
philosopher
and
a
patron
,
on
the
people
down
in
the
trenches
.
   
<EOS>
My
reflections
on
this
theme
were
still
in
progress
when
dinner
was
announced
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Waterbrook
went
down
with
Hamlet
's
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Henry
Spiker
took
Mrs
Waterbrook
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
,
whom
I
should
have
liked
to
take
myself
,
was
given
to
a
simpering
fellow
with
weak
legs
.
<EOS>
Uriah
,
Traddles
,
and
I
,
as
the
junior
part
of
the
company
,
went
down
last
,
how
we
could
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
so
vexed
at
losing
Agnes
as
I
might
have
been
,
since
it
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
making
myself
known
to
Traddles
on
the
stairs
,
who
greeted
me
with
great
fervour
;
while
Uriah
writhed
with
such
obtrusive
satisfaction
and
self
-
abasement
,
that
I
could
gladly
have
pitched
him
over
the
banisters
.
<EOS>
Traddles
and
I
were
separated
at
table
,
being
billeted
in
two
remote
corners
:
he
in
the
glare
of
a
red
velvet
lady
;
I
,
in
the
gloom
of
Hamlet
's
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
The
dinner
was
very
long
,
and
the
conversation
was
about
the
Aristocracy
---
and
Blood
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Waterbrook
repeatedly
told
us
,
that
if
she
had
a
weakness
,
it
was
Blood
.
   
<EOS>
It
occurred
to
me
several
times
that
we
should
have
got
on
better
,
if
we
had
not
been
quite
so
genteel
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
so
exceedingly
genteel
,
that
our
scope
was
very
limited
.
 
<EOS>
A
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Gulpidge
were
of
the
party
,
who
had
something
to
do
at
second
-
hand
(
at
least
,
Mr
Gulpidge
had
)
with
the
law
business
of
the
Bank
;
and
what
with
the
Bank
,
and
what
with
the
Treasury
,
we
were
as
exclusive
as
the
Court
Circular
.
 
<EOS>
To
mend
the
matter
,
Hamlet
's
aunt
had
the
family
failing
of
indulging
in
soliloquy
,
and
held
forth
in
a
desultory
manner
,
by
herself
,
on
every
topic
that
was
introduced
.
<EOS>
These
were
few
enough
,
to
be
sure
;
but
as
we
always
fell
back
upon
Blood
,
she
had
as
wide
a
field
for
abstract
speculation
as
her
nephew
himself
.
   
<EOS>
We
might
have
been
a
party
of
Ogres
,
the
conversation
assumed
such
a
sanguine
complexion
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
confess
I
am
of
Mrs
Waterbrook
's
opinion
,
"
said
Mr
Waterbrook
,
with
his
wine
-
glass
at
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
Other
things
are
all
very
well
in
their
way
,
but
give
me
Blood
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
,
"
observed
Hamlet
's
aunt
,
"
<EOS>
so
satisfactory
to
one
!
 
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
that
is
so
much
one
's
beau
-
ideal
of
---
of
all
that
sort
of
thing
,
speaking
generally
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
some
low
minds
(
not
many
,
I
am
happy
to
believe
,
but
there
are
some
)
that
would
prefer
to
do
what
I
should
call
bow
down
before
idols
.
<EOS>
Positively
Idols
!
 
<EOS>
Before
service
,
intellect
,
and
so
on
.
 
<EOS>
But
these
are
intangible
points
.
 
<EOS>
Blood
is
not
so
.
 
<EOS>
We
see
Blood
in
a
nose
,
and
we
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
meet
with
it
in
a
chin
,
and
we
say
,
"
There
it
is
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
Blood
!
<EOS>
"
It
is
an
actual
matter
of
fact
.
 
<EOS>
We
point
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
admits
of
no
doubt
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
simpering
fellow
with
the
weak
legs
,
who
had
taken
Agnes
down
,
stated
the
question
more
decisively
yet
,
I
thought
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
know
,
deuce
take
it
,
"
said
this
gentleman
,
looking
round
the
board
with
an
imbecile
smile
,
"
we
ca
n't
forego
Blood
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
We
must
have
Blood
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Some
young
fellows
,
you
know
,
may
be
a
little
behind
their
station
,
perhaps
,
in
point
of
education
and
behaviour
,
and
may
go
a
little
wrong
,
you
know
,
and
get
themselves
and
other
people
into
a
variety
of
fixes
---
and
all
that
---
<EOS>
but
deuce
take
it
<EOS>
,
it
's
delightful
to
reflect
that
they
've
got
Blood
in
'em
!
<EOS>
Myself
,
I
'd
rather
at
any
time
be
knocked
down
by
a
man
who
had
got
Blood
in
him
,
than
I
'd
be
picked
up
by
a
man
who
had
n't
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
sentiment
,
as
compressing
the
general
question
into
a
nutshell
,
gave
the
utmost
satisfaction
,
and
brought
the
gentleman
into
great
notice
until
the
ladies
retired
.
 
<EOS>
After
that
,
I
observed
that
Mr
Gulpidge
and
Mr
Henry
Spiker
,
who
had
hitherto
been
very
distant
,
entered
into
a
defensive
alliance
against
us
,
the
common
enemy
,
and
exchanged
a
mysterious
dialogue
across
the
table
for
our
defeat
and
overthrow
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
affair
of
the
first
bond
for
four
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
has
not
taken
the
course
that
was
expected
,
Spiker
,
"
said
Mr
Gulpidge
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
the
D
of
A%
's
?
"
said
Mr
Spiker
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
C
of
B
's
!
"
said
Mr
Gulpidge
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Spiker
raised
his
eyebrows
,
and
looked
much
concerned
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
the
question
was
referred
to
Lord
---
I
need
n't
name
him
,
"
said
Mr
Gulpidge
,
checking
himself
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
"
said
Mr
Spiker
,
"
N.
"
   
Mr
Gulpidge
darkly
nodded
---
"
was
referred
to
him
,
his
answer
was
,
"
Money
,
or
no
release
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
Lord
bless
my
soul
!
"
cried
Mr
Spiker
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Money
,
or
no
release
,
"
"
repeated
Mr
Gulpidge
,
firmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
next
in
reversion
---
you
understand
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
K
,
"
said
Mr
Spiker
,
with
an
ominous
look
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
K
then
positively
refused
to
sign
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
attended
at
Newmarket
for
that
purpose
,
and
he
point
-
blank
refused
to
do
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Spiker
was
so
interested
,
that
he
became
quite
stony
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
the
matter
rests
at
this
hour
,
"
said
Mr
Gulpidge
,
throwing
himself
back
in
his
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Our
friend
Waterbrook
will
excuse
me
if
I
forbear
to
explain
myself
generally
,
on
account
of
the
magnitude
of
the
interests
involved
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Waterbrook
was
only
too
happy
,
as
it
appeared
to
me
,
to
have
such
interests
,
and
such
names
,
even
hinted
at
,
across
his
table
.
<EOS>
He
assumed
an
expression
of
gloomy
intelligence
(
though
I
am
persuaded
he
knew
no
more
about
the
discussion
than
I
did
)
,
and
highly
approved
of
the
discretion
that
had
been
observed
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Spiker
,
after
the
receipt
of
such
a
confidence
,
naturally
desired
to
favour
his
friend
with
a
confidence
of
his
own
;
therefore
the
foregoing
dialogue
was
succeeded
by
another
,
in
which
it
was
Mr
Gulpidge
's
turn
to
be
surprised
,
and
that
by
another
in
which
the
surprise
came
round
to
Mr
Spiker
's
turn
again
,
and
so
on
,
turn
and
turn
about
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
we
,
the
outsiders
,
remained
oppressed
by
the
tremendous
interests
involved
in
the
conversation
;
and
our
host
regarded
us
with
pride
,
as
the
victims
of
a
salutary
awe
and
astonishment
.
<EOS>
I
was
very
glad
indeed
to
get
upstairs
to
Agnes
,
and
to
talk
with
her
in
a
corner
,
and
to
introduce
Traddles
to
her
,
who
was
shy
,
but
agreeable
,
and
the
same
good
-
natured
creature
still
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
was
obliged
to
leave
early
,
on
account
of
going
away
next
morning
for
a
month
,
I
had
not
nearly
so
much
conversation
with
him
as
I
could
have
wished
;
but
we
exchanged
addresses
,
and
promised
ourselves
the
pleasure
of
another
meeting
when
he
should
come
back
to
town
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
greatly
interested
to
hear
that
I
knew
Steerforth
,
and
spoke
of
him
with
such
warmth
that
I
made
him
tell
Agnes
what
he
thought
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
Agnes
only
looked
at
me
the
while
,
and
very
slightly
shook
her
head
when
only
I
observed
her
.
   
<EOS>
As
she
was
not
among
people
with
whom
I
believed
she
could
be
very
much
at
home
,
I
was
almost
glad
to
hear
that
she
was
going
away
within
a
few
days
,
though
I
was
sorry
at
the
prospect
of
parting
from
her
again
so
soon
.
 
<EOS>
This
caused
me
to
remain
until
all
the
company
were
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Conversing
with
her
,
and
hearing
her
sing
,
was
such
a
delightful
reminder
to
me
of
my
happy
life
in
the
grave
old
house
she
had
made
so
beautiful
,
that
I
could
have
remained
there
half
the
night
;
but
,
having
no
excuse
for
staying
any
longer
,
when
the
lights
of
Mr
Waterbrook
's
society
were
all
snuffed
out
<EOS>
,
I
took
my
leave
very
much
against
my
inclination
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
then
,
more
than
ever
,
that
she
was
my
better
Angel
;
and
if
I
thought
of
her
sweet
face
and
placid
smile
,
as
though
they
had
shone
on
me
from
some
removed
being
,
like
an
Angel
<EOS>
,
I
hope
I
thought
no
harm
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
said
that
the
company
were
all
gone
;
but
I
ought
to
have
excepted
Uriah
,
whom
I
do
n't
include
in
that
denomination
,
and
who
had
never
ceased
to
hover
near
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
close
behind
me
when
I
went
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
close
beside
me
,
when
I
walked
away
from
the
house
,
slowly
fitting
his
long
skeleton
fingers
into
the
still
longer
fingers
of
a
great
Guy
Fawkes
pair
of
gloves
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
in
no
disposition
for
Uriah
's
company
,
but
in
remembrance
of
the
entreaty
Agnes
had
made
to
me
,
that
I
asked
him
if
he
would
come
home
to
my
rooms
,
and
have
some
coffee
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
really
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
he
rejoined
---
"
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mister
Copperfield
,
but
<EOS>
the
other
comes
so
natural
,
I
do
n't
like
that
you
should
put
a
constraint
upon
yourself
to
ask
a
numble
person
like
me
to
your
ouse
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
constraint
in
the
case
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
come
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
,
very
much
,
"
replied
Uriah
,
with
a
writhe
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
come
along
!
"
said
I.
   
I
could
not
help
being
rather
short
with
him
,
but
he
appeared
not
to
mind
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
went
the
nearest
way
,
without
conversing
much
upon
the
road
;
and
he
was
so
humble
in
respect
of
those
scarecrow
gloves
,
that
he
was
still
putting
them
on
,
and
seemed
to
have
made
no
advance
in
that
labour
,
when
we
got
to
my
place
.
   
<EOS>
I
led
him
up
the
dark
stairs
,
to
prevent
his
knocking
his
head
against
anything
,
and
really
his
damp
cold
hand
felt
so
like
a
frog
in
mine
,
that
I
was
tempted
to
drop
it
and
run
away
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
and
hospitality
prevailed
,
however
,
and
I
conducted
him
to
my
fireside
.
<EOS>
When
I
lighted
my
candles
,
he
fell
into
meek
transports
with
the
room
that
was
revealed
to
him
;
and
when
I
heated
the
coffee
in
an
unassuming
block
-
tin
vessel
in
which
Mrs
Crupp
delighted
to
prepare
it
(
chiefly
,
I
believe
,
because
it
was
not
intended
for
the
purpose
,
being
a
shaving
-
pot
,
and
because
there
was
a
patent
invention
of
great
price
mouldering
away
in
the
pantry
)
,
he
professed
so
much
emotion
,
that
I
could
joyfully
have
scalded
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
really
,
Master
Copperfield
,
---
I
mean
Mister
Copperfield
,
"
said
Uriah
,
"
to
see
you
waiting
upon
me
<EOS>
is
what
I
never
could
have
expected
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
one
way
and
another
,
so
many
things
happen
to
me
which
I
never
could
have
expected
,
I
am
sure
,
in
my
umble
station
,
that
it
seems
to
rain
blessings
on
my
ed
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
heard
something
,
I
des
-
say
,
of
a
change
in
my
expectations
,
Master
Copperfield
,
---
I
should
say
,
Mister
Copperfield
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
sat
on
my
sofa
,
with
his
long
knees
drawn
up
under
his
coffee
-
cup
,
his
hat
and
gloves
upon
the
ground
close
to
him
,
his
spoon
going
softly
round
and
round
,
his
shadowless
red
eyes
,
which
looked
as
if
they
had
scorched
their
lashes
off
,
turned
towards
me
without
looking
at
me
,
the
disagreeable
dints
I
have
formerly
described
in
his
nostrils
coming
and
going
with
his
breath
,
and
a
snaky
undulation
pervading
his
frame
from
his
chin
to
his
boots
,
I
decided
in
my
own
mind
that
I
disliked
him
intensely
.
 
<EOS>
It
made
me
very
uncomfortable
to
have
him
for
a
guest
,
for
I
was
young
then
,
and
unused
to
disguise
what
I
so
strongly
felt
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
heard
something
,
I
des
-
say
,
of
a
change
in
my
expectations
,
Master
Copperfield
,
---
I
should
say
,
Mister
Copperfield
?
<EOS>
"
observed
Uriah
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
I
,
"
something
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
thought
Miss
Agnes
would
know
of
it
!
"
<EOS>
he
quietly
returned
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
to
find
Miss
Agnes
knows
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
thank
you
,
Master
---
Mister
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
have
thrown
my
bootjack
at
him
<EOS>
(
it
lay
ready
on
the
rug
)
,
for
having
entrapped
me
into
the
disclosure
of
anything
concerning
Agnes
,
however
immaterial
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
only
drank
my
coffee
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
prophet
you
have
shown
yourself
,
Mister
Copperfield
!
"
pursued
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
what
a
prophet
you
have
proved
yourself
to
be
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
saying
to
me
once
,
that
perhaps
I
should
be
a
partner
in
Mr
Wickfield
's
business
,
and
perhaps
it
might
be
Wickfield
and
Heep
?
 
<EOS>
You
may
not
recollect
it
;
but
when
a
person
is
umble
,
Master
Copperfield
,
a
person
treasures
such
things
up
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
recollect
talking
about
it
,
"
said
I
,
"
though
I
certainly
did
not
think
it
very
likely
then
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
who
would
have
thought
it
likely
,
Mister
Copperfield
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Uriah
,
enthusiastically
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
did
n't
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
saying
with
my
own
lips
that
I
was
much
too
umble
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
considered
myself
really
and
truly
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
sat
,
with
that
carved
grin
on
his
face
,
looking
at
the
fire
,
as
I
looked
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
the
umblest
persons
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
he
presently
resumed
,
"
may
be
the
instruments
of
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
think
I
have
been
the
instrument
of
good
to
Mr
Wickfield
,
and
that
I
may
be
more
so
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
what
a
worthy
man
he
is
,
Mister
Copperfield
,
but
how
imprudent
he
has
been
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
hear
it
,
"
said
<EOS>
I.
 
I
could
not
help
adding
,
rather
pointedly
,
"
on
all
accounts
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Decidedly
so
,
Mister
Copperfield
,
"
replied
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
all
accounts
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Agnes
's
above
all
!
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
remember
your
own
eloquent
expressions
,
Master
Copperfield
;
but
I
remember
how
you
said
one
day
that
everybody
must
admire
her
,
and
how
I
thanked
you
for
it
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
forgot
that
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
Master
Copperfield
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
I
,
drily
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
how
glad
I
am
you
have
not
!
"
exclaimed
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
think
that
you
should
be
the
first
to
kindle
the
sparks
of
ambition
in
my
umble
breast
,
and
that
you
've
not
forgot
it
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
---
Would
you
excuse
me
asking
for
a
cup
more
coffee
?
"
   
<EOS>
Something
in
the
emphasis
he
laid
upon
the
kindling
of
those
sparks
,
and
something
in
the
glance
he
directed
at
me
as
he
said
it
,
had
made
me
start
as
if
I
had
seen
him
illuminated
by
a
blaze
of
light
.
 
<EOS>
Recalled
by
his
request
,
preferred
in
quite
another
tone
of
voice
,
I
did
the
honours
of
the
shaving
-
pot
;
but
I
did
them
with
an
unsteadiness
of
hand
,
a
sudden
sense
of
being
no
match
for
him
,
and
a
perplexed
suspicious
anxiety
as
to
what
he
might
be
going
to
say
next
,
which
I
felt
could
not
escape
his
observation
.
   
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
He
stirred
his
coffee
round
and
round
,
he
sipped
it
<EOS>
,
he
felt
his
chin
softly
with
his
grisly
hand
,
he
looked
at
the
fire
,
he
looked
about
the
room
,
he
gasped
rather
than
smiled
at
me
,
he
writhed
and
undulated
about
,
in
his
deferential
servility
,
he
stirred
and
sipped
again
,
but
he
left
the
renewal
of
the
conversation
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
,
Mr
Wickfield
,
"
said
I
,
at
last
,
"
who
is
worth
five
hundred
of
you
---
or
me
"
;
for
my
life
,
I
think
,
I
could
not
have
helped
dividing
that
part
of
the
sentence
with
an
awkward
jerk
;
"
has
been
imprudent
,
has
he
,
Mr
Heep
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
very
imprudent
indeed
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
returned
Uriah
,
sighing
modestly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
very
much
so
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
wish
you
'd
call
me
Uriah
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
like
old
times
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
Uriah
,
"
said
I
,
bolting
it
out
with
some
difficulty
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
he
returned
,
with
fervour
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Master
Copperfield
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
like
the
blowing
of
old
breezes
or
the
ringing
of
old
bellses
to
hear
YOU
say
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
Was
I
making
any
observation
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
About
Mr
Wickfield
,
"
I
suggested
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
truly
,
"
said
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Great
imprudence
,
Master
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
topic
that
I
would
n't
touch
upon
,
to
any
soul
but
you
.
 
<EOS>
Even
to
you
I
can
only
touch
upon
it
,
and
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
If
anyone
else
had
been
in
my
place
during
the
last
few
years
,
by
this
time
he
would
have
had
Mr
Wickfield
<EOS>
(
oh
,
what
a
worthy
man
he
is
,
Master
Copperfield
,
too
!
)
<EOS>
under
his
thumb
.
 
<EOS>
Un
-
der
---
his
thumb
,
"
said
Uriah
,
very
slowly
,
as
he
stretched
out
his
cruel
-
looking
hand
above
my
table
,
and
pressed
his
own
thumb
upon
it
,
until
it
shook
,
and
shook
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
obliged
to
look
at
him
with
him
splay
foot
on
Mr
Wickfield
's
head
,
I
think
I
could
scarcely
have
hated
him
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
,
yes
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
he
proceeded
,
in
a
soft
voice
,
most
remarkably
contrasting
with
the
action
of
his
thumb
,
which
did
not
diminish
its
hard
pressure
in
the
least
degree
,
"
there
's
no
doubt
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
would
have
been
loss
,
disgrace
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
what
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
knows
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
the
umble
instrument
of
umbly
serving
him
,
and
he
puts
me
on
an
eminence
I
hardly
could
have
hoped
to
reach
.
 
<EOS>
How
thankful
should
I
be
!
"
<EOS>
With
his
face
turned
towards
me
,
as
he
finished
,
but
without
looking
at
me
,
he
took
his
crooked
thumb
off
the
spot
where
he
had
planted
it
,
and
slowly
and
thoughtfully
scraped
his
lank
jaw
with
it
,
as
if
he
were
shaving
himself
.
   
<EOS>
I
recollect
well
how
indignantly
my
heart
beat
,
as
I
saw
his
crafty
face
,
with
the
appropriately
red
light
of
the
fire
upon
it
,
preparing
for
something
else
.
   
<EOS>
"
Master
Copperfield
,
"
he
began
---
"
but
am
I
keeping
you
up
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
keeping
me
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
generally
go
to
bed
late
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Master
Copperfield
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
risen
from
my
umble
station
since
first
you
used
to
address
me
,
it
is
true
;
but
I
am
umble
still
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
never
shall
be
otherwise
than
umble
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
think
the
worse
of
my
umbleness
,
if
I
make
a
little
confidence
to
you
,
Master
Copperfield
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
"
said
I
,
with
an
effort
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
!
"
<EOS>
He
took
out
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
and
began
wiping
the
palms
of
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Agnes
,
Master
Copperfield
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Uriah
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
how
pleasant
to
be
called
Uriah
,
spontaneously
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
;
and
gave
himself
a
jerk
,
like
a
convulsive
fish
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
thought
her
looking
very
beautiful
tonight
,
Master
Copperfield
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
her
looking
as
she
always
does
:
superior
,
in
all
respects
,
to
everyone
around
her
,
"
I
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
thank
you
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
so
true
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
thank
you
very
much
for
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
I
said
,
loftily
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
reason
why
you
should
thank
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
that
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
said
Uriah
,
"
is
,
in
fact
,
the
confidence
that
I
am
going
to
take
the
liberty
of
reposing
.
 
<EOS>
Umble
as
I
am
,
"
he
wiped
his
hands
harder
,
and
looked
at
them
and
at
the
fire
by
turns
,
"
umble
as
my
mother
is
,
and
lowly
as
our
poor
but
honest
roof
has
ever
been
,
the
image
of
Miss
Agnes
(
I
do
n't
mind
trusting
you
with
my
secret
,
Master
Copperfield
,
<EOS>
for
I
have
always
overflowed
towards
you
since
the
first
moment
<EOS>
I
had
the
pleasure
of
beholding
you
in
a
pony
-
shay
)
has
been
in
my
breast
for
years
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Master
Copperfield
,
with
what
a
pure
affection
do
I
love
the
ground
my
Agnes
walks
on
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
believe
I
had
a
delirious
idea
of
seizing
the
red
-
hot
poker
out
of
the
fire
,
and
running
him
through
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
went
from
me
with
a
shock
,
like
a
ball
fired
from
a
rifle
:
but
the
image
of
Agnes
,
outraged
by
so
much
as
a
thought
of
this
red
-
headed
animal
's
,
remained
in
my
mind
when
I
looked
at
him
,
sitting
all
awry
as
if
his
mean
soul
griped
his
body
,
and
made
me
giddy
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
swell
and
grow
before
my
eyes
;
the
room
seemed
full
of
the
echoes
of
his
voice
;
and
the
strange
feeling
(
to
which
,
perhaps
,
no
one
is
quite
a
stranger
)
that
all
this
had
occurred
before
,
at
some
indefinite
time
,
and
that
I
knew
what
he
was
going
to
say
next
,
took
possession
of
me
.
   
<EOS>
A
timely
observation
of
the
sense
of
power
that
there
was
in
his
face
,
did
more
to
bring
back
to
my
remembrance
the
entreaty
of
Agnes
,
in
its
full
force
,
than
any
effort
I
could
have
made
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
him
,
with
a
better
appearance
of
composure
than
I
could
have
thought
possible
a
minute
before
,
whether
he
had
made
his
feelings
known
to
Agnes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
Master
Copperfield
!
"
<EOS>
he
returned
;
"
<EOS>
oh
dear
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
Not
to
anyone
but
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
I
am
only
just
emerging
from
my
lowly
station
.
 
<EOS>
I
rest
a
good
deal
of
hope
on
her
observing
how
useful
I
am
to
her
father
<EOS>
(
for
I
trust
to
be
very
useful
to
him
indeed
,
Master
Copperfield
)
,
and
how
I
smooth
the
way
for
him
,
and
keep
him
straight
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
so
much
attached
to
her
father
,
Master
Copperfield
<EOS>
(
oh
,
what
a
lovely
thing
it
is
in
a
daughter
!
)
,
that
I
think
she
may
come
,
on
his
account
,
to
be
kind
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
fathomed
the
depth
of
the
rascal
's
whole
scheme
,
and
understood
why
he
laid
it
bare
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
have
the
goodness
to
keep
my
secret
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
and
not
,
in
general
,
to
go
against
me
,
I
shall
take
it
as
a
particular
favour
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
n't
wish
to
make
unpleasantness
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
a
friendly
heart
you
've
got
;
but
having
only
known
me
on
my
umble
footing
(
on
my
umblest
I
should
say
,
for
I
am
very
umble
still
)
,
you
might
,
unbeknown
,
go
against
me
rather
,
with
my
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
her
mine
,
you
see
,
Master
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
song
that
says
,
"
I
'd
crowns
resign
,
to
call
her
mine
!
<EOS>
"
I
hope
to
do
it
,
one
of
these
days
.
"
   
<EOS>
Dear
Agnes
!
 
<EOS>
So
much
too
loving
and
too
good
for
anyone
that
I
could
think
of
,
was
it
possible
that
she
was
reserved
to
be
the
wife
of
such
a
wretch
as
this
!
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
hurry
at
present
,
you
know
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
Uriah
proceeded
,
in
his
slimy
way
,
as
I
sat
gazing
at
him
,
with
this
thought
in
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
Agnes
is
very
young
still
;
and
mother
and
me
will
have
to
work
our
way
upwards
,
and
make
a
good
many
new
arrangements
,
before
it
would
be
quite
convenient
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
shall
have
time
gradually
to
make
her
familiar
with
my
hopes
,
as
opportunities
offer
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
'm
so
much
obliged
to
you
for
this
confidence
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
it
's
such
a
relief
,
you
ca
n't
think
,
to
know
that
you
understand
our
situation
,
and
are
certain
(
as
you
would
n't
wish
to
make
unpleasantness
in
the
family
)
not
to
go
against
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
took
the
hand
which
I
dared
not
withhold
,
and
having
given
it
a
damp
squeeze
,
referred
to
his
pale
-
faced
watch
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
it
's
past
one
.
 
<EOS>
The
moments
slip
away
so
,
in
the
confidence
of
old
times
,
Master
Copperfield
,
that
it
's
almost
half
past
one
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
answered
that
I
had
thought
it
was
later
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
I
had
really
thought
so
,
but
because
my
conversational
powers
were
effectually
scattered
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
considering
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
ouse
that
I
am
stopping
at
---
a
sort
of
a
private
hotel
and
boarding
ouse
,
Master
Copperfield
,
near
the
New
River
ed
---
will
have
gone
to
bed
these
two
hours
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
,
"
<EOS>
I
returned
,
"
that
there
is
only
one
bed
here
,
and
that
I
---
"
   
"
Oh
,
do
n't
think
of
mentioning
beds
,
Master
Copperfield
!
"
<EOS>
he
rejoined
ecstatically
,
drawing
up
one
leg
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
would
you
have
any
objections
to
my
laying
down
before
the
fire
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
comes
to
that
,
"
I
said
,
"
pray
take
my
bed
,
and
I
'll
lie
down
before
the
fire
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
repudiation
of
this
offer
was
almost
shrill
enough
,
in
the
excess
of
its
surprise
and
humility
,
to
have
penetrated
to
the
ears
of
Mrs
Crupp
,
then
sleeping
,
I
suppose
,
in
a
distant
chamber
,
situated
at
about
the
level
of
low
-
water
mark
,
soothed
in
her
slumbers
by
the
ticking
of
an
incorrigible
clock
,
to
which
she
always
referred
me
when
we
had
any
little
difference
on
the
score
of
punctuality
,
and
which
was
never
less
than
three
-
quarters
of
an
hour
too
slow
,
and
had
always
been
put
right
in
the
morning
by
the
best
authorities
.
 
<EOS>
As
no
arguments
I
could
urge
,
in
my
bewildered
condition
,
had
the
least
effect
upon
his
modesty
in
inducing
him
to
accept
my
bedroom
,
I
was
obliged
to
make
the
best
arrangements
I
could
,
for
his
repose
before
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
The
mattress
of
the
sofa
(
which
was
a
great
deal
too
short
for
his
lank
figure
)
,
the
sofa
pillows
,
a
blanket
,
the
table
-
cover
,
a
clean
breakfast
-
cloth
,
and
a
great
-
coat
,
made
him
a
bed
and
covering
,
for
which
he
was
more
than
thankful
.
 
<EOS>
Having
lent
him
a
night
-
cap
,
which
he
put
on
at
once
,
and
in
which
he
made
such
an
awful
figure
,
that
I
have
never
worn
one
since
,
I
left
him
to
his
rest
.
   
<EOS>
I
never
shall
forget
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
shall
forget
how
I
turned
and
tumbled
;
how
I
wearied
myself
with
thinking
about
Agnes
and
this
creature
<EOS>
;
how
I
considered
what
could
I
do
,
and
what
ought
I
to
do
;
how
I
could
come
to
no
other
conclusion
than
that
the
best
course
for
her
peace
was
to
do
nothing
,
and
to
keep
to
myself
what
I
had
heard
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
went
to
sleep
for
a
few
moments
,
the
image
of
Agnes
with
her
tender
eyes
,
and
of
her
father
looking
fondly
on
her
,
as
I
had
so
often
seen
him
look
,
arose
before
me
with
appealing
faces
,
and
filled
me
with
vague
terrors
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
awoke
,
the
recollection
that
Uriah
was
lying
in
the
next
room
,
sat
heavy
on
me
like
a
waking
nightmare
;
and
oppressed
me
with
a
leaden
dread
,
as
if
I
had
had
some
meaner
quality
of
devil
for
a
lodger
.
   
<EOS>
The
poker
got
into
my
dozing
thoughts
besides
,
and
would
n't
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
,
between
sleeping
and
waking
,
that
it
was
still
red
hot
,
and
I
had
snatched
it
out
of
the
fire
,
and
run
him
through
the
body
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
haunted
at
last
by
the
idea
,
though
I
knew
there
was
nothing
in
it
,
<EOS>
that
I
stole
into
the
next
room
to
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
There
I
saw
him
,
lying
on
his
back
,
with
his
legs
extending
to
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
where
,
gurglings
taking
place
in
his
throat
,
stoppages
in
his
nose
,
and
his
mouth
open
like
a
post
-
office
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
much
worse
in
reality
than
in
my
distempered
fancy
,
<EOS>
that
afterwards
I
was
attracted
to
him
in
very
repulsion
,
and
could
not
help
wandering
in
and
out
<EOS>
every
half
-
hour
or
so
,
and
taking
another
look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
the
long
,
long
night
seemed
heavy
and
hopeless
as
ever
,
and
no
promise
of
day
was
in
the
murky
sky
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
saw
him
going
downstairs
early
in
the
morning
(
for
,
thank
Heaven
!
<EOS>
he
would
not
stay
to
breakfast
)
,
it
appeared
to
me
as
if
the
night
was
going
away
in
his
person
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
went
out
to
the
Commons
,
I
charged
Mrs
Crupp
with
particular
directions
to
leave
the
windows
open
,
that
my
sitting
-
room
might
be
aired
,
and
purged
of
his
presence
.

Chapter
26
.
<EOS>
I
fall
into
captivity
 
<EOS>
I
saw
no
more
of
Uriah
Heep
,
until
the
day
when
Agnes
left
town
.
<EOS>
I
was
at
the
coach
office
to
take
leave
of
her
and
see
her
go
;
and
there
was
he
,
returning
to
Canterbury
by
the
same
conveyance
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
some
small
satisfaction
to
me
to
observe
his
spare
,
short
-
waisted
,
high
-
shouldered
,
mulberry
-
coloured
great
-
coat
perched
up
,
in
company
with
an
umbrella
like
a
small
tent
,
on
the
edge
of
the
back
seat
on
the
roof
,
while
Agnes
was
,
of
course
,
inside
;
but
what
I
underwent
in
my
efforts
to
be
friendly
with
him
,
while
Agnes
looked
on
,
perhaps
deserved
that
little
recompense
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
coach
window
,
as
at
the
dinner
-
party
,
he
hovered
about
us
without
a
moment
's
intermission
,
like
a
great
vulture
:
gorging
himself
on
every
syllable
that
I
said
to
Agnes
,
or
Agnes
said
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
state
of
trouble
into
which
his
disclosure
by
my
fire
had
thrown
me
,
I
had
thought
very
much
of
the
words
Agnes
had
used
in
reference
to
the
partnership
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
what
I
hope
was
right
.
<EOS>
Feeling
sure
that
it
was
necessary
for
papa
's
peace
that
the
sacrifice
should
be
made
,
I
entreated
him
to
make
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
miserable
foreboding
that
she
would
yield
to
,
and
sustain
herself
by
,
the
same
feeling
in
reference
to
any
sacrifice
for
his
sake
,
had
oppressed
me
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
how
she
loved
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
what
the
devotion
of
her
nature
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
from
her
own
lips
that
she
regarded
herself
as
the
innocent
cause
of
his
errors
,
and
as
owing
him
a
great
debt
she
ardently
desired
to
pay
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
consolation
in
seeing
how
different
she
was
from
this
detestable
Rufus
with
the
mulberry
-
coloured
great
-
coat
,
<EOS>
for
I
felt
that
in
the
very
difference
between
them
,
in
the
self
-
denial
of
her
pure
soul
and
the
sordid
baseness
of
his
,
the
greatest
danger
lay
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
,
doubtless
,
he
knew
thoroughly
,
and
had
,
in
his
cunning
,
considered
well
.
   
<EOS>
Yet
I
was
so
certain
that
the
prospect
of
such
a
sacrifice
afar
off
,
must
destroy
the
happiness
of
Agnes
;
and
I
was
so
sure
,
from
her
manner
,
of
its
being
unseen
by
her
then
,
and
having
cast
no
shadow
on
her
yet
;
that
I
could
as
soon
have
injured
her
,
as
given
her
any
warning
of
what
impended
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
it
was
that
we
parted
without
explanation
<EOS>
:
she
waving
her
hand
and
smiling
farewell
from
the
coach
window
;
her
evil
genius
writhing
on
the
roof
,
as
if
he
had
her
in
his
clutches
and
triumphed
.
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
get
over
this
farewell
glimpse
of
them
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
When
Agnes
wrote
to
tell
me
of
her
safe
arrival
,
I
was
as
miserable
as
when
I
saw
her
going
away
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
I
fell
into
a
thoughtful
state
,
this
subject
was
sure
to
present
itself
,
and
all
my
uneasiness
was
sure
to
be
redoubled
.
 
<EOS>
Hardly
a
night
passed
without
my
dreaming
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
became
a
part
of
my
life
,
and
as
inseparable
from
my
life
as
my
own
head
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
ample
leisure
to
refine
upon
my
uneasiness
:
for
Steerforth
was
at
Oxford
,
as
he
wrote
to
me
,
and
when
I
was
not
at
the
Commons
,
I
was
very
much
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
had
at
this
time
some
lurking
distrust
of
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
I
wrote
to
him
most
affectionately
in
reply
to
his
,
but
I
think
I
was
glad
,
upon
the
whole
,
that
he
could
not
come
to
London
just
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
suspect
the
truth
to
be
,
that
the
influence
of
Agnes
was
upon
me
,
undisturbed
by
the
sight
of
him
;
and
that
it
was
the
more
powerful
with
me
,
because
she
had
so
large
a
share
in
my
thoughts
and
interest
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
days
and
weeks
slipped
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
articled
to
Spenlow
and
Jorkins
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
ninety
pounds
a
year
<EOS>
(
exclusive
of
my
house
-
rent
and
sundry
collateral
matters
)
from
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
My
rooms
were
engaged
for
twelve
months
certain
:
and
though
I
still
found
them
dreary
of
an
evening
,
and
the
evenings
long
,
I
could
settle
down
into
a
state
of
equable
low
spirits
,
and
resign
myself
to
coffee
;
which
I
seem
,
on
looking
back
,
to
have
taken
by
the
gallon
at
about
this
period
of
my
existence
.
 
<EOS>
At
about
this
time
,
too
,
I
made
three
discoveries
:
first
,
that
Mrs
Crupp
was
a
martyr
to
a
curious
disorder
called
"
the
spazzums
"
,
which
was
generally
accompanied
with
inflammation
of
the
nose
,
and
required
to
be
constantly
treated
with
peppermint
;
secondly
,
that
something
peculiar
in
the
temperature
of
my
pantry
,
made
the
brandy
-
bottles
burst
;
thirdly
,
that
I
was
alone
in
the
world
,
and
much
given
to
record
that
circumstance
in
fragments
of
English
versification
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
day
when
I
was
articled
,
no
festivity
took
place
,
beyond
my
having
sandwiches
and
sherry
into
the
office
for
the
clerks
,
and
going
alone
to
the
theatre
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
see
The
Stranger
,
as
a
Doctors
'
Commons
sort
of
play
,
and
was
so
dreadfully
cut
up
,
that
I
hardly
knew
myself
in
my
own
glass
when
I
got
home
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
remarked
,
on
this
occasion
,
when
we
concluded
our
business
,
that
he
should
have
been
happy
to
have
seen
me
at
his
house
at
Norwood
to
celebrate
our
becoming
connected
,
but
for
his
domestic
arrangements
being
in
some
disorder
,
on
account
of
the
expected
return
of
his
daughter
from
finishing
her
education
at
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
he
intimated
that
when
she
came
home
he
should
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
entertaining
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
that
he
was
a
widower
with
one
daughter
,
and
expressed
my
acknowledgements
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
was
as
good
as
his
word
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
week
or
two
,
he
referred
to
this
engagement
,
and
said
,
that
if
I
would
do
him
the
favour
to
come
down
next
Saturday
,
and
stay
till
Monday
,
he
would
be
extremely
happy
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
I
said
I
would
do
him
the
favour
;
and
he
was
to
drive
me
down
in
his
phaeton
,
and
to
bring
me
back
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
day
arrived
,
my
very
carpet
-
bag
was
an
object
of
veneration
to
the
stipendiary
clerks
,
to
whom
the
house
at
Norwood
was
a
sacred
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
them
informed
me
that
he
had
heard
that
Mr
Spenlow
ate
entirely
off
plate
and
china
;
and
another
hinted
at
champagne
being
constantly
on
draught
,
after
the
usual
custom
of
table
-
beer
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
clerk
with
the
wig
,
whose
name
was
Mr
Tiffey
,
had
been
down
on
business
several
times
in
the
course
of
his
career
,
and
had
on
each
occasion
penetrated
to
the
breakfast
-
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
He
described
it
as
an
apartment
of
the
most
sumptuous
nature
,
and
said
that
he
had
drunk
brown
East
India
sherry
there
,
of
a
quality
so
precious
as
to
make
a
man
wink
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
an
adjourned
cause
in
the
Consistory
that
day
---
about
excommunicating
a
baker
who
had
been
objecting
in
a
vestry
to
a
paving
-
rate
---
and
as
the
evidence
was
just
twice
the
length
of
Robinson
Crusoe
,
according
to
a
calculation
I
made
,
it
was
rather
late
in
the
day
before
we
finished
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
we
got
him
excommunicated
for
six
weeks
,
and
sentenced
in
no
end
of
costs
;
and
then
the
baker
's
proctor
,
and
the
judge
,
and
the
advocates
on
both
sides
(
who
were
all
nearly
related
)
,
went
out
of
town
together
,
and
Mr
Spenlow
<EOS>
and
I
drove
away
in
the
phaeton
.
   
<EOS>
The
phaeton
was
a
very
handsome
affair
;
the
horses
arched
their
necks
and
lifted
up
their
legs
as
if
they
knew
they
belonged
to
Doctors
'
Commons
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
good
deal
of
competition
in
the
Commons
on
all
points
of
display
,
and
it
turned
out
some
very
choice
equipages
then
;
though
I
always
have
considered
,
and
always
shall
consider
,
that
in
my
time
the
great
article
of
competition
there
was
starch
:
which
I
think
was
worn
among
the
proctors
to
as
great
an
extent
as
it
is
in
the
nature
of
man
to
bear
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
very
pleasant
,
going
down
,
and
Mr
Spenlow
gave
me
some
hints
in
reference
to
my
profession
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
it
was
the
genteelest
profession
in
the
world
,
and
must
on
no
account
be
confounded
with
the
profession
of
a
solicitor
:
being
quite
another
sort
of
thing
,
infinitely
more
exclusive
,
less
mechanical
,
and
more
profitable
.
<EOS>
We
took
things
much
more
easily
in
the
Commons
than
they
could
be
taken
anywhere
else
,
he
observed
,
and
that
set
us
,
as
a
privileged
class
,
apart
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
it
was
impossible
to
conceal
the
disagreeable
fact
,
that
we
were
chiefly
employed
by
solicitors
;
but
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
they
were
an
inferior
race
of
men
,
universally
looked
down
upon
by
all
proctors
of
any
pretensions
.
   
<EOS>
I
asked
Mr
Spenlow
what
he
considered
the
best
sort
of
professional
business
?
 
<EOS>
He
replied
,
that
a
good
case
of
a
disputed
will
,
where
there
was
a
neat
little
estate
of
thirty
or
forty
thousand
pounds
,
was
,
perhaps
,
the
best
of
all
.
 
<EOS>
In
such
a
case
,
he
said
,
not
only
were
there
very
pretty
pickings
,
in
the
way
of
arguments
at
every
stage
of
the
proceedings
,
and
mountains
upon
mountains
of
evidence
on
interrogatory
and
counter
-
interrogatory
(
to
say
nothing
of
an
appeal
lying
,
first
to
the
Delegates
,
and
then
to
the
Lords
)
,
but
,
the
costs
being
pretty
sure
to
come
out
of
the
estate
at
last
,
both
sides
went
at
it
in
a
lively
and
spirited
manner
,
and
expense
was
no
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
launched
into
a
general
eulogium
on
the
Commons
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
to
be
particularly
admired
(
he
said
)
in
the
Commons
,
was
its
compactness
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
most
conveniently
organized
place
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
complete
idea
of
snugness
.
 
<EOS>
It
lay
in
a
nutshell
.
 
<EOS>
For
example
:
You
brought
a
divorce
case
,
or
a
restitution
case
,
into
the
Consistory
.
<EOS>
Very
good
.
 
<EOS>
You
tried
it
in
the
Consistory
.
 
<EOS>
You
made
a
quiet
little
round
game
of
it
,
among
a
family
group
,
and
you
played
it
out
at
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
Suppose
you
were
not
satisfied
with
the
Consistory
,
what
did
you
do
then
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
you
went
into
the
Arches
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
Arches
?
 
<EOS>
The
same
court
,
in
the
same
room
,
with
the
same
bar
,
and
the
same
practitioners
,
but
another
judge
,
for
there
the
Consistory
judge
could
plead
any
court
-
day
as
an
advocate
.
<EOS>
Well
,
you
played
your
round
game
out
again
.
 
<EOS>
Still
you
were
not
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
Very
good
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
you
do
then
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
you
went
to
the
Delegates
.
 
<EOS>
Who
were
the
Delegates
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
the
Ecclesiastical
Delegates
were
the
advocates
without
any
business
,
who
had
looked
on
at
the
round
game
when
it
was
playing
in
both
courts
,
and
had
seen
the
cards
shuffled
,
and
cut
,
and
played
,
and
had
talked
to
all
the
players
about
it
,
and
now
came
fresh
,
as
judges
,
to
settle
the
matter
to
the
satisfaction
of
everybody
!
 
<EOS>
Discontented
people
might
talk
of
corruption
in
the
Commons
,
closeness
in
the
Commons
,
and
the
necessity
of
reforming
the
Commons
,
said
Mr
Spenlow
solemnly
,
in
conclusion
;
but
when
the
price
of
wheat
per
bushel
had
been
highest
,
the
Commons
had
been
busiest
;
and
a
man
might
lay
his
hand
upon
his
heart
,
and
say
this
to
the
whole
world
,
---
<EOS>
"
Touch
the
Commons
,
and
down
comes
the
country
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
listened
to
all
this
with
attention
;
and
though
,
I
must
say
,
I
had
my
doubts
whether
the
country
was
quite
as
much
obliged
to
the
Commons
as
Mr
Spenlow
made
out
<EOS>
,
I
respectfully
deferred
to
his
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
That
about
the
price
of
wheat
per
bushel
,
I
modestly
felt
was
too
much
for
my
strength
,
and
quite
settled
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
,
to
this
hour
,
got
the
better
of
that
bushel
of
wheat
.
<EOS>
It
has
reappeared
to
annihilate
me
,
all
through
my
life
,
in
connexion
with
all
kinds
of
subjects
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
now
,
exactly
,
what
it
has
to
do
with
me
,
or
what
right
<EOS>
it
has
to
crush
me
,
on
an
infinite
variety
of
occasions
;
but
whenever
I
see
my
old
friend
the
bushel
brought
in
by
the
head
and
shoulders
(
as
he
always
is
,
I
observe
)
,
I
give
up
a
subject
for
lost
.
   
<EOS>
This
is
a
digression
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
the
man
to
touch
the
Commons
,
and
bring
down
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
I
submissively
expressed
,
by
my
silence
,
my
acquiescence
in
all
I
had
heard
from
my
superior
in
years
and
knowledge
;
and
we
talked
about
The
Stranger
and
the
Drama
,
and
the
pairs
of
horses
,
until
we
came
to
Mr
Spenlow
's
gate
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
lovely
garden
to
Mr
Spenlow
's
house
;
and
though
that
was
not
the
best
time
of
the
year
for
seeing
a
garden
,
it
was
so
beautifully
kept
,
that
I
was
quite
enchanted
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
charming
lawn
,
there
were
clusters
of
trees
,
and
there
were
perspective
walks
that
I
could
just
distinguish
in
the
dark
,
arched
over
with
trellis
-
work
,
on
which
shrubs
and
flowers
grew
in
the
growing
season
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
Miss
Spenlow
walks
by
herself
,
"
I
thought
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
went
into
the
house
,
which
was
cheerfully
lighted
up
,
and
into
a
hall
where
there
were
all
sorts
of
hats
,
caps
,
great
-
coats
,
plaids
,
gloves
,
whips
,
and
walking
-
sticks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Miss
Dora
?
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
to
the
servant
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dora
!
<EOS>
"
I
thought
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
beautiful
name
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
turned
into
a
room
near
at
hand
(
I
think
it
was
the
identical
breakfast
-
room
,
made
memorable
by
the
brown
East
Indian
sherry
)
,
and
I
heard
a
voice
say
,
"
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
my
daughter
Dora
,
and
my
daughter
Dora
's
confidential
friend
!
<EOS>
"
It
was
,
no
doubt
,
Mr
Spenlow
's
voice
,
but
I
did
n't
know
it
,
and
I
did
n't
care
whose
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
All
was
over
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
fulfilled
my
destiny
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
a
captive
and
a
slave
.
 
<EOS>
I
loved
Dora
Spenlow
to
distraction
!
   
<EOS>
She
was
more
than
human
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
Fairy
,
a
Sylph
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
what
she
was
---
<EOS>
anything
that
no
one
ever
saw
,
and
everything
that
everybody
ever
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
swallowed
up
in
an
abyss
of
love
in
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
pausing
on
the
brink
;
no
looking
down
,
or
looking
back
;
I
was
gone
,
headlong
,
before
I
had
sense
to
say
a
word
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
,
"
observed
a
well
-
remembered
voice
,
when
I
had
bowed
and
murmured
something
,
"
have
seen
Mr
Copperfield
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
speaker
was
not
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
No
;
the
confidential
friend
,
Miss
Murdstone
!
   
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
was
much
astonished
.
 
<EOS>
To
the
best
of
my
judgement
,
no
capacity
of
astonishment
was
left
in
me
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
worth
mentioning
in
the
material
world
,
but
Dora
Spenlow
,
to
be
astonished
about
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
How
do
you
do
,
Miss
Murdstone
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
well
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
answered
,
"
Very
well
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
How
is
Mr
Murdstone
?
"
<EOS>
She
replied
,
"
My
brother
is
robust
,
I
am
obliged
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
,
who
,
I
suppose
,
had
been
surprised
to
see
us
recognize
each
other
,
then
put
in
his
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
find
,
"
he
said
,
"
Copperfield
,
that
you
and
Miss
Murdstone
are
already
acquainted
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Copperfield
and
myself
,
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
with
severe
composure
,
"
are
connexions
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
once
slightly
acquainted
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
his
childish
days
.
 
<EOS>
Circumstances
have
separated
us
since
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
known
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
replied
that
I
should
have
known
her
,
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
Which
was
true
enough
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Murdstone
has
had
the
goodness
,
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
to
me
,
"
to
accept
the
office
---
if
I
may
so
describe
it
---
of
my
daughter
Dora
's
confidential
friend
.
 
<EOS>
My
daughter
Dora
having
,
unhappily
,
no
mother
,
Miss
Murdstone
is
obliging
enough
to
become
her
companion
and
protector
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
passing
thought
occurred
to
me
that
Miss
Murdstone
,
like
the
pocket
instrument
called
a
life
-
preserver
,
was
not
so
much
designed
for
purposes
of
protection
as
of
assault
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
I
had
none
but
passing
thoughts
for
any
subject
<EOS>
save
Dora
,
I
glanced
at
her
,
directly
afterwards
,
and
was
thinking
that
I
saw
,
in
her
prettily
pettish
manner
,
that
she
was
not
very
much
inclined
to
be
particularly
confidential
to
her
companion
and
protector
,
when
a
bell
rang
,
which
Mr
Spenlow
said
was
the
first
dinner
-
bell
,
and
so
carried
me
off
to
dress
.
   
<EOS>
The
idea
of
dressing
one
's
self
,
or
doing
anything
in
the
way
of
action
,
in
that
state
of
love
,
was
a
little
too
ridiculous
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
only
sit
down
before
my
fire
,
biting
the
key
of
my
carpet
-
bag
,
and
think
of
the
captivating
,
girlish
,
bright
-
eyed
lovely
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
form
she
had
,
what
a
face
<EOS>
she
had
,
what
a
graceful
,
variable
,
enchanting
manner
!
   
<EOS>
The
bell
rang
again
so
soon
that
I
made
a
mere
scramble
of
my
dressing
,
<EOS>
instead
of
the
careful
operation
I
could
have
wished
under
the
circumstances
,
and
went
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
some
company
.
 
<EOS>
Dora
was
talking
to
an
old
gentleman
with
a
grey
head
.
<EOS>
Grey
as
he
was
---
and
a
great
-
grandfather
into
the
bargain
,
for
he
said
so
---
I
was
madly
jealous
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
What
a
state
of
mind
<EOS>
I
was
in
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
jealous
of
everybody
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
bear
the
idea
of
anybody
knowing
Mr
Spenlow
better
than
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
torturing
to
me
to
hear
them
talk
of
occurrences
in
which
I
had
had
no
share
.
 
<EOS>
When
a
most
amiable
person
,
with
a
highly
polished
bald
head
,
asked
me
across
the
dinner
table
,
if
that
were
the
first
occasion
of
my
seeing
the
grounds
,
I
could
have
done
anything
to
him
that
was
savage
and
revengeful
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
n't
remember
who
was
there
,
except
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
least
idea
what
we
had
for
dinner
,
besides
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
My
impression
is
,
that
I
dined
off
Dora
,
entirely
,
and
sent
away
half
-
a
-
dozen
plates
untouched
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
next
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
talked
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
the
most
delightful
little
voice
,
the
gayest
little
laugh
,
the
pleasantest
and
most
fascinating
little
ways
,
that
ever
led
a
lost
youth
into
hopeless
slavery
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
rather
diminutive
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
So
much
the
more
precious
,
I
thought
.
   
<EOS>
When
she
went
out
of
the
room
with
Miss
Murdstone
(
no
other
ladies
were
of
the
party
)
,
I
fell
into
a
reverie
,
only
disturbed
by
the
cruel
apprehension
that
Miss
Murdstone
would
disparage
me
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
amiable
creature
with
the
polished
head
told
me
a
long
story
,
which
I
think
was
about
gardening
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
heard
him
say
,
"
my
gardener
"
,
several
times
.
 
<EOS>
I
seemed
to
pay
the
deepest
attention
to
him
,
but
I
was
wandering
in
a
garden
of
Eden
all
the
while
,
with
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
My
apprehensions
of
being
disparaged
to
the
object
of
my
engrossing
affection
were
revived
when
we
went
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
by
the
grim
and
distant
aspect
of
Miss
Murdstone
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
relieved
of
them
in
an
unexpected
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
David
Copperfield
,
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
beckoning
me
aside
into
a
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
word
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
confronted
Miss
Murdstone
alone
.
   
<EOS>
"
David
Copperfield
,
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
"
I
need
not
enlarge
upon
family
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
not
a
tempting
subject
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Far
from
it
,
ma'am
,
<EOS>
"
I
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Far
from
it
,
"
assented
Miss
Murdstone
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wish
to
revive
the
memory
of
past
differences
,
or
of
past
outrages
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
received
outrages
from
a
person
---
a
female
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
for
the
credit
of
my
sex
---
who
is
not
to
be
mentioned
without
scorn
and
disgust
;
and
therefore
I
would
rather
not
mention
her
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
felt
very
fiery
on
my
aunt
's
account
;
but
I
said
it
would
certainly
be
better
,
if
Miss
Murdstone
pleased
,
not
to
mention
her
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
hear
her
disrespectfully
mentioned
,
I
added
,
without
expressing
my
opinion
in
a
decided
tone
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
shut
her
eyes
,
and
disdainfully
inclined
her
head
;
then
,
slowly
opening
her
eyes
,
resumed
:
   
"
<EOS>
David
Copperfield
,
I
shall
not
attempt
to
disguise
the
fact
,
that
I
formed
an
unfavourable
opinion
of
you
in
your
childhood
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
been
a
mistaken
one
,
or
you
may
have
ceased
to
justify
it
.
<EOS>
That
is
not
in
question
between
us
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
belong
to
a
family
remarkable
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
for
some
firmness
;
and
I
am
not
the
creature
of
circumstance
or
change
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
my
opinion
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
have
your
opinion
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
inclined
my
head
,
in
my
turn
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
not
necessary
,
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
"
that
these
opinions
should
come
into
collision
here
.
 
<EOS>
Under
existing
circumstances
,
it
is
as
well
on
all
accounts
that
they
should
not
.
<EOS>
As
the
chances
of
life
have
brought
us
together
again
,
and
may
bring
us
together
on
other
occasions
,
I
would
say
,
let
us
meet
here
as
distant
acquaintances
.
 
<EOS>
Family
circumstances
are
a
sufficient
reason
for
our
only
meeting
on
that
footing
,
and
it
is
quite
unnecessary
that
either
of
us
should
make
the
other
the
subject
of
remark
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
approve
of
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Murdstone
,
"
<EOS>
I
returned
,
"
I
think
you
and
Mr
Murdstone
used
me
very
cruelly
,
and
treated
my
mother
with
great
unkindness
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
always
think
so
,
as
long
as
I
live
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
quite
agree
in
what
you
propose
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
shut
her
eyes
again
,
and
bent
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
just
touching
the
back
of
my
hand
with
the
tips
of
her
cold
,
stiff
fingers
,
she
walked
away
,
arranging
the
little
fetters
on
her
wrists
and
round
her
neck
;
which
seemed
to
be
the
same
set
,
in
exactly
the
same
state
,
as
when
I
had
seen
her
last
.
 
<EOS>
These
reminded
me
,
in
reference
to
Miss
Murdstone
's
nature
,
of
the
fetters
over
a
jail
door
;
suggesting
on
the
outside
,
to
all
beholders
,
what
was
to
be
expected
within
.
   
<EOS>
All
I
know
of
the
rest
of
the
evening
is
,
that
I
heard
the
empress
of
my
heart
sing
enchanted
ballads
in
the
French
language
,
generally
to
the
effect
that
,
whatever
was
the
matter
,
we
ought
always
to
dance
,
<EOS>
Ta
ra
la
,
<EOS>
Ta
ra
la
<EOS>
!
<EOS>
accompanying
herself
on
a
glorified
instrument
,
resembling
a
guitar
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
was
lost
in
blissful
delirium
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
refused
refreshment
.
 
<EOS>
That
my
soul
recoiled
from
punch
particularly
.
 
<EOS>
That
when
Miss
Murdstone
took
her
into
custody
and
led
her
away
,
she
smiled
and
gave
me
her
delicious
hand
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
caught
a
view
of
myself
in
a
mirror
,
looking
perfectly
imbecile
and
idiotic
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
retired
to
bed
in
a
most
maudlin
state
of
mind
,
and
got
up
in
a
crisis
of
feeble
infatuation
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
morning
,
and
early
,
and
I
thought
I
would
go
and
take
a
stroll
down
one
of
those
wire
-
arched
walks
,
and
indulge
my
passion
by
dwelling
on
her
image
.
 
<EOS>
On
my
way
through
the
hall
,
I
encountered
her
little
dog
,
who
was
called
Jip
---
short
for
Gipsy
.
<EOS>
I
approached
him
tenderly
,
for
I
loved
even
him
;
but
he
showed
his
whole
set
of
teeth
,
got
under
a
chair
expressly
to
snarl
,
and
would
n't
hear
of
the
least
familiarity
.
   
<EOS>
The
garden
was
cool
and
solitary
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
about
,
wondering
what
my
feelings
of
happiness
would
be
,
if
I
could
ever
become
engaged
to
this
dear
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
marriage
,
and
fortune
,
and
all
that
,
I
believe
I
was
almost
as
innocently
undesigning
then
,
as
when
I
loved
little
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
allowed
to
call
her
"
Dora
"
,
to
write
to
her
,
to
dote
upon
and
worship
her
,
to
have
reason
to
think
that
when
she
was
with
other
people
she
was
yet
mindful
of
me
,
seemed
to
me
the
summit
of
human
ambition
---
<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
was
the
summit
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
I
was
a
lackadaisical
young
spooney
;
but
there
was
a
purity
of
heart
in
all
this
,
that
prevents
my
having
quite
a
contemptuous
recollection
of
it
,
let
me
laugh
as
I
may
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
not
been
walking
long
,
when
I
turned
a
corner
,
and
met
her
.
<EOS>
I
tingle
again
from
head
to
foot
as
my
recollection
turns
that
corner
,
and
my
pen
shakes
in
my
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
---
are
---
out
early
,
Miss
Spenlow
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
so
stupid
at
home
,
"
she
replied
,
"
and
Miss
Murdstone
is
so
absurd
!
 
<EOS>
She
talks
such
nonsense
about
its
being
necessary
for
the
day
to
be
aired
,
before
I
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
Aired
!
"
<EOS>
(
She
laughed
,
here
,
in
the
most
melodious
manner
.
)
<EOS>
"
On
a
Sunday
morning
,
when
I
do
n't
practise
,
I
must
do
something
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
told
papa
last
night
I
must
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
's
the
brightest
time
of
the
whole
day
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
hazarded
a
bold
flight
,
and
said
(
not
without
stammering
)
that
it
was
very
bright
to
me
then
,
though
it
had
been
very
dark
to
me
a
minute
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
a
compliment
?
"
said
Dora
,
"
or
that
the
weather
has
really
changed
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
stammered
worse
than
before
,
in
replying
that
I
meant
no
compliment
,
but
the
plain
truth
;
though
I
was
not
aware
of
any
change
having
taken
place
in
the
weather
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
state
of
my
own
feelings
,
I
added
bashfully
:
to
clench
the
explanation
.
   
<EOS>
I
never
saw
such
curls
---
how
could
I
,
for
there
never
were
such
curls
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
as
those
she
shook
out
to
hide
her
blushes
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
straw
hat
and
blue
ribbons
which
was
on
the
top
of
the
curls
,
if
I
could
only
have
hung
it
up
in
my
room
in
Buckingham
Street
,
what
a
priceless
possession
it
would
have
been
!
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
just
come
home
from
Paris
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
ever
been
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
hope
you
'll
go
soon
!
 
<EOS>
You
would
like
it
so
much
!

<EOS>
Traces

seated
anguish
appeared
in
my
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
That
she
should
hope
I
would
go
,
that
she
should
think
it
possible
<EOS>
I
could
go
,
was
insupportable
.
 
<EOS>
I
depreciated
Paris
;
I
depreciated
France
.
<EOS>
I
said
I
would
n't
leave
England
,
under
existing
circumstances
,
for
any
earthly
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
should
induce
me
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
she
was
shaking
the
curls
again
,
when
the
little
dog
came
running
along
the
walk
to
our
relief
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
mortally
jealous
of
me
,
and
persisted
in
barking
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
him
up
in
her
arms
---
<EOS>
oh
my
goodness
!
---
and
caressed
him
,
but
he
persisted
upon
barking
still
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
n't
let
me
touch
him
,
when
I
tried
;
and
then
she
beat
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
increased
my
sufferings
greatly
to
see
the
pats
she
gave
him
for
punishment
on
the
bridge
of
his
blunt
nose
,
while
he
winked
his
eyes
,
and
licked
her
hand
,
and
still
growled
within
himself
like
a
little
double
-
bass
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
was
quiet
---
well
he
might
be
with
her
dimpled
chin
upon
his
head
!
<EOS>
---
and
we
walked
away
to
look
at
a
greenhouse
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
very
intimate
with
Miss
Murdstone
,
are
you
?
"
said
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
---
"
My
pet
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
(
The
two
last
words
were
to
the
dog
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
they
had
only
been
to
me
!
)
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
I
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
tiresome
creature
,
"
said
Dora
,
pouting
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
think
what
papa
can
have
been
about
,
when
he
chose
such
a
vexatious
thing
to
be
my
companion
.
 
<EOS>
Who
wants
a
protector
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
want
a
protector
.
 
<EOS>
Jip
can
protect
me
a
great
deal
better
than
Miss
Murdstone
,
---
ca
n't
you
,
Jip
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
only
winked
lazily
,
when
she
kissed
his
ball
of
a
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Papa
calls
her
my
confidential
friend
,
but
I
am
sure
she
is
no
such
thing
---
is
she
,
Jip
?
 
<EOS>
We
are
not
going
to
confide
in
any
such
cross
people
,
Jip
and
I.
 
<EOS>
We
mean
to
bestow
our
confidence
where
we
like
,
and
to
find
out
our
own
friends
,
instead
of
having
them
found
out
for
us
---
do
n't
we
,
Jip
?
"
   
<EOS>
jip
made
a
comfortable
noise
,
in
answer
,
a
little
like
a
tea
-
kettle
when
it
sings
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
every
word
was
a
new
heap
of
fetters
,
riveted
above
the
last
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
hard
,
because
we
have
not
a
kind
Mama
,
that
we
are
to
have
,
instead
,
a
sulky
,
gloomy
old
thing
like
Miss
Murdstone
,
always
following
us
about
---
is
n't
it
,
Jip
?
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
,
Jip
.
 
<EOS>
We
wo
n't
be
confidential
,
and
we
'll
make
ourselves
as
happy
as
we
can
in
spite
of
her
,
and
we
'll
tease
her
,
and
not
please
her
---
wo
n't
we
,
Jip
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
If
it
had
lasted
any
longer
,
I
think
I
must
have
gone
down
on
my
knees
on
the
gravel
,
with
the
probability
before
me
of
grazing
them
,
and
of
being
presently
ejected
from
the
premises
besides
.
<EOS>
But
,
by
good
fortune
the
greenhouse
was
not
far
off
,
and
these
words
brought
us
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
It
contained
quite
a
show
of
beautiful
geraniums
.
 
<EOS>
We
loitered
along
in
front
of
them
,
and
Dora
often
stopped
to
admire
this
one
or
that
one
,
and
I
stopped
to
admire
the
same
one
,
and
Dora
,
laughing
,
held
the
dog
up
childishly
,
to
smell
the
flowers
;
and
if
we
were
not
all
three
in
Fairyland
,
certainly
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
The
scent
of
a
geranium
leaf
,
at
this
day
,
strikes
me
with
a
half
comical
half
serious
wonder
as
to
what
change
has
come
over
me
in
a
moment
;
and
then
I
see
a
straw
hat
and
blue
ribbons
,
and
a
quantity
of
curls
,
and
a
little
black
dog
being
held
up
,
in
two
slender
arms
,
against
a
bank
of
blossoms
and
bright
leaves
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
had
been
looking
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
She
found
us
here
;
and
presented
her
uncongenial
cheek
,
the
little
wrinkles
in
it
filled
with
hair
powder
,
to
Dora
to
be
kissed
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
took
Dora
's
arm
in
hers
,
and
marched
us
into
breakfast
as
if
it
were
a
soldier
's
funeral
.
   
<EOS>
How
many
cups
of
tea
I
drank
,
because
Dora
made
it
,
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
But
,
I
perfectly
remember
that
I
sat
swilling
tea
until
my
whole
nervous
system
,
if
I
had
had
any
in
those
days
,
must
have
gone
by
the
board
.
 
<EOS>
By
and
by
we
went
to
church
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
was
between
Dora
and
me
in
the
pew
;
but
I
heard
her
sing
,
and
the
congregation
vanished
.
 
<EOS>
A
sermon
was
delivered
---
about
Dora
,
of
course
---
and
I
am
afraid
that
is
all
I
know
of
the
service
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
a
quiet
day
.
 
<EOS>
No
company
,
a
walk
,
a
family
dinner
of
four
,
and
an
evening
of
looking
over
books
and
pictures
;
Miss
Murdstone
with
a
homily
before
her
,
and
her
eye
upon
us
,
keeping
guard
vigilantly
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
little
<EOS>
did
Mr
Spenlow
imagine
,
when
he
sat
opposite
to
me
after
dinner
that
day
,
with
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
over
his
head
,
how
fervently
I
was
embracing
him
,
in
my
fancy
,
as
his
son
-
in
-
law
!
 
<EOS>
Little
<EOS>
did
he
think
,
<EOS>
when
I
took
leave
of
him
at
night
,
that
he
had
just
given
his
full
consent
to
my
being
engaged
to
Dora
,
and
that
I
was
invoking
blessings
on
his
head
!
   
<EOS>
We
departed
early
in
the
morning
,
for
we
had
a
Salvage
case
coming
on
in
the
Admiralty
Court
,
requiring
a
rather
accurate
knowledge
of
the
whole
science
of
navigation
,
in
which
(
as
we
could
n't
be
expected
to
know
much
about
those
matters
in
the
Commons
)
<EOS>
the
judge
had
entreated
two
old
Trinity
Masters
,
for
charity
's
sake
,
to
come
and
help
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
Dora
was
at
the
breakfast
-
table
to
make
the
tea
again
,
however
;
and
I
had
the
melancholy
pleasure
of
taking
off
my
hat
to
her
in
the
phaeton
,
as
she
stood
on
the
door
-
step
with
Jip
in
her
arms
.
   
<EOS>
What
the
Admiralty
was
to
me
that
day
;
what
nonsense
I
made
of
our
case
in
my
mind
,
as
I
listened
to
it
;
how
I
saw
"
DORA
"
engraved
upon
the
blade
of
the
silver
oar
which
they
lay
upon
the
table
,
as
the
emblem
of
that
high
jurisdiction
;
and
how
I
felt
when
Mr
Spenlow
went
home
without
me
<EOS>
(
I
had
had
an
insane
hope
that
he
might
take
me
back
again
)
,
as
if
I
were
a
mariner
myself
,
and
the
ship
to
which
I
belonged
had
sailed
away
and
left
me
on
a
desert
island
;
I
shall
make
no
fruitless
effort
to
describe
.
 
<EOS>
If
that
sleepy
old
court
could
rouse
itself
,
and
present
in
any
visible
form
the
daydreams
I
have
had
in
it
about
Dora
,
it
would
reveal
my
truth
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
the
dreams
that
I
dreamed
on
that
day
alone
,
but
day
after
day
,
from
week
to
week
,
and
term
to
term
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
there
,
not
to
attend
to
what
was
going
on
,
but
to
think
about
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
If
ever
I
bestowed
a
thought
upon
the
cases
,
as
they
dragged
their
slow
length
before
me
,
it
was
only
to
wonder
,
in
the
matrimonial
cases
(
remembering
Dora
)
,
how
it
was
that
married
people
could
ever
be
otherwise
than
happy
;
and
,
in
the
Prerogative
cases
,
to
consider
,
if
the
money
in
question
had
been
left
to
me
,
what
were
the
foremost
steps
I
should
immediately
have
taken
in
regard
to
Dora
.
<EOS>
Within
the
first
week
of
my
passion
,
I
bought
four
sumptuous
waistcoats
---
not
for
myself
;
I
had
no
pride
in
them
;
for
Dora
---
and
took
to
wearing
straw
-
coloured
kid
gloves
in
the
streets
,
and
laid
the
foundations
of
all
the
corns
I
have
ever
had
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
boots
I
wore
at
that
period
could
only
be
produced
and
compared
with
the
natural
size
of
my
feet
,
they
would
show
what
the
state
of
my
heart
was
,
in
a
most
affecting
manner
.
   
<EOS>
And
yet
,
wretched
cripple
as
I
made
myself
by
this
act
of
homage
to
Dora
<EOS>
,
I
walked
miles
upon
miles
daily
in
the
hope
of
seeing
her
.
<EOS>
Not
only
was
I
soon
as
well
known
on
the
Norwood
Road
as
the
postmen
on
that
beat
,
but
I
pervaded
London
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
about
the
streets
where
the
best
shops
for
ladies
were
,
I
haunted
the
Bazaar
like
an
unquiet
spirit
,
I
fagged
through
the
Park
again
and
again
,
long
after
I
was
quite
knocked
up
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
at
long
intervals
and
on
rare
occasions
,
I
saw
her
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
saw
her
glove
waved
in
a
carriage
window
;
perhaps
I
met
her
,
walked
with
her
and
Miss
Murdstone
a
little
way
,
and
spoke
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
latter
case
I
was
always
very
miserable
afterwards
,
to
think
that
I
had
said
nothing
to
the
purpose
;
or
that
she
had
no
idea
of
the
extent
of
my
devotion
,
or
that
she
cared
nothing
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
always
looking
out
,
as
may
be
supposed
,
for
another
invitation
to
Mr
Spenlow
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
always
being
disappointed
,
for
I
got
none
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Crupp
must
have
been
a
woman
of
penetration
;
for
when
this
attachment
was
but
a
few
weeks
old
,
and
I
had
not
had
the
courage
to
write
more
explicitly
even
to
Agnes
,
than
that
I
had
been
to
Mr
Spenlow
's
house
,
"
whose
family
,
"
I
added
,
"
consists
of
one
daughter
"
;
---
I
say
Mrs
Crupp
must
have
been
a
woman
of
penetration
,
for
,
even
in
that
early
stage
,
she
found
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
She
came
up
to
me
one
evening
,
when
I
was
very
low
,
to
ask
(
she
being
then
afflicted
with
the
disorder
I
have
mentioned
)
if
I
could
oblige
her
with
a
little
tincture
of
cardamums
mixed
with
rhubarb
,
and
flavoured
with
seven
drops
of
the
essence
of
cloves
,
which
was
the
best
remedy
for
her
complaint
;
---
or
,
if
I
had
not
such
a
thing
by
me
,
with
a
little
brandy
,
which
was
the
next
best
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
<EOS>
,
she
remarked
,
so
palatable
to
her
,
but
it
was
the
next
best
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
had
never
even
heard
of
the
first
remedy
,
and
always
had
the
second
in
the
closet
,
I
gave
Mrs
Crupp
a
glass
of
the
second
,
which
(
that
I
might
have
no
suspicion
of
its
being
devoted
to
any
improper
use
)
<EOS>
she
began
to
take
in
my
presence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Cheer
up
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Crupp
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
abear
to
see
you
<EOS>
so
,
sir
:
I
'm
a
mother
myself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
did
not
quite
perceive
the
application
of
this
fact
to
myself
,
but
I
smiled
on
Mrs
Crupp
,
as
benignly
as
was
in
my
power
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Crupp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
it
is
,
sir
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
lady
in
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Crupp
?
<EOS>
"
I
returned
,
reddening
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
bless
you
!
 
<EOS>
Keep
a
good
heart
,
sir
!
"
said
Mrs
Crupp
,
nodding
encouragement
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
say
die
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
If
She
do
n't
smile
upon
you
,
there
's
a
many
as
will
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
young
gentleman
to
be
smiled
on
,
Mr
Copperfull
,
and
you
must
learn
your
walue
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Crupp
always
called
me
Mr
Copperfull
:
firstly
,
no
doubt
,
because
it
was
not
my
name
;
and
secondly
,
I
am
inclined
to
think
,
in
some
indistinct
association
with
a
washing
-
day
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
makes
you
suppose
there
is
any
young
lady
in
the
case
,
Mrs
Crupp
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Copperfull
,
"
said
Mrs
Crupp
,
with
a
great
deal
of
feeling
,
"
I
'm
a
mother
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
For
some
time
Mrs
Crupp
could
only
lay
her
hand
upon
her
nankeen
bosom
,
and
fortify
herself
against
returning
pain
with
sips
of
her
medicine
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
she
spoke
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
the
present
set
were
took
for
you
by
your
dear
aunt
,
Mr
Copperfull
,
"
said
Mrs
Crupp
,
"
my
remark
were
,
I
had
now
found
summun
I
could
care
for
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
Ev'in
!
"
were
the
expression
,
"
I
have
now
found
summun
I
can
care
for
!
"
<EOS>
---
You
do
n't
eat
enough
,
sir
,
nor
yet
drink
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
what
you
found
your
supposition
on
,
Mrs
Crupp
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Crupp
,
in
a
tone
approaching
to
severity
,
"
I
've
laundressed
other
young
gentlemen
besides
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
A
young
gentleman
may
be
over
-
careful
of
himself
,
or
he
may
be
under
-
careful
of
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
brush
his
hair
too
regular
,
or
too
un
-
regular
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
wear
his
boots
much
too
large
for
him
,
or
much
too
small
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
according
as
the
young
gentleman
has
his
original
character
formed
.
 
<EOS>
But
let
him
go
to
which
extreme
<EOS>
he
may
,
sir
,
there
's
a
young
lady
in
both
of
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Crupp
shook
her
head
in
such
a
determined
manner
,
that
I
had
not
an
inch
of
vantage
-
ground
left
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
but
the
gentleman
which
died
here
before
yourself
,
"
said
Mrs
Crupp
,
"
that
fell
in
love
---
with
a
barmaid
---
and
had
his
waistcoats
took
in
directly
,
though
much
swelled
by
drinking
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Crupp
,
"
said
I
,
"
I
must
beg
you
not
to
connect
the
young
lady
in
my
case
with
a
barmaid
,
or
anything
of
that
sort
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Copperfull
,
"
returned
Mrs
Crupp
,
"
I
'm
a
mother
myself
,
and
not
likely
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
your
pardon
,
sir
,
if
I
intrude
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
never
wish
to
intrude
where
I
were
not
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
are
a
young
gentleman
,
Mr
Copperfull
,
and
my
adwice
to
you
<EOS>
is
,
to
cheer
up
,
sir
,
to
keep
a
good
heart
,
and
to
know
your
own
walue
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
was
to
take
to
something
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Crupp
,
"
if
you
was
to
take
to
skittles
,
now
,
which
is
healthy
,
you
might
find
it
divert
your
mind
,
and
do
you
good
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
Mrs
Crupp
,
affecting
to
be
very
careful
of
the
brandy
---
which
was
all
gone
---
thanked
me
with
a
majestic
curtsey
,
and
retired
.
 
<EOS>
As
her
figure
disappeared
into
the
gloom
of
the
entry
,
this
counsel
certainly
presented
itself
to
my
mind
in
the
light
of
a
slight
liberty
on
Mrs
Crupp
's
part
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
I
was
content
to
receive
it
,
in
another
point
of
view
,
as
a
word
to
the
wise
,
and
a
warning
in
future
to
keep
my
secret
better
.

<EOS>
Tommy
Traddles
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
been
in
consequence
of
Mrs
Crupp
's
advice
,
and
,
perhaps
,
for
no
better
reason
than
because
there
was
a
certain
similarity
in
the
sound
of
the
word
skittles
and
Traddles
,
that
it
came
into
my
head
,
next
day
,
to
go
and
look
after
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
The
time
he
had
mentioned
was
more
than
out
,
and
he
lived
in
a
little
street
near
the
Veterinary
College
at
Camden
Town
,
which
was
principally
tenanted
,
as
one
of
our
clerks
who
lived
in
that
direction
informed
me
,
by
gentlemen
students
,
who
bought
live
donkeys
,
and
made
experiments
on
those
quadrupeds
in
their
private
apartments
.
 
<EOS>
Having
obtained
from
this
clerk
a
direction
to
the
academic
grove
in
question
,
I
set
out
,
the
same
afternoon
,
to
visit
my
old
schoolfellow
.
   
<EOS>
I
found
that
the
street
was
not
as
desirable
a
one
as
I
could
have
wished
it
to
be
,
for
the
sake
of
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
appeared
to
have
a
propensity
to
throw
any
little
trifles
they
were
not
in
want
of
,
into
the
road
:
which
not
only
made
it
rank
and
sloppy
,
but
untidy
too
,
on
account
of
the
cabbage
-
leaves
.
 
<EOS>
The
refuse
was
not
wholly
vegetable
either
,
for
I
myself
saw
a
shoe
,
a
doubled
-
up
saucepan
,
a
black
bonnet
,
and
an
umbrella
,
in
various
stages
of
decomposition
,
as
I
was
looking
out
for
the
number
I
wanted
.
   
<EOS>
The
general
air
of
the
place
reminded
me
forcibly
of
the
days
when
I
lived
with
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
An
indescribable
character
of
faded
gentility
that
attached
to
the
house
I
sought
,
and
made
it
unlike
all
the
other
houses
in
the
street
---
though
they
were
all
built
on
one
monotonous
pattern
,
and
looked
like
the
early
copies
of
a
blundering
boy
who
was
learning
to
make
houses
,
and
had
not
yet
got
out
of
his
cramped
brick
-
and
-
mortar
pothooks
---
reminded
me
still
more
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
Happening
to
arrive
at
the
door
as
it
was
opened
to
the
afternoon
milkman
,
I
was
reminded
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
more
forcibly
yet
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
the
milkman
to
a
very
youthful
servant
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
Has
that
there
little
bill
of
mine
been
heerd
on
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
master
says
he
'll
attend
to
it
immediate
,
"
was
the
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
said
the
milkman
,
going
on
as
if
he
had
received
no
answer
,
and
speaking
,
as
I
judged
from
his
tone
,
rather
for
the
edification
of
somebody
within
the
house
,
than
of
the
youthful
servant
---
an
impression
which
was
strengthened
by
his
manner
of
glaring
down
the
passage
---
"
because
that
there
little
bill
has
been
running
so
long
,
that
I
begin
to
believe
it
's
run
away
altogether
,
and
never
wo
n't
be
heerd
of
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
'm
not
a
going
to
stand
it
,
you
know
!
"
said
the
milkman
,
still
throwing
his
voice
into
the
house
,
and
glaring
down
the
passage
.
   
<EOS>
As
to
his
dealing
in
the
mild
article
of
milk
,
by
the
by
,
there
never
was
a
greater
anomaly
.
 
<EOS>
His
deportment
would
have
been
fierce
in
a
butcher
or
a
brandy
-
merchant
.
   
<EOS>
The
voice
of
the
youthful
servant
became
faint
,
but
she
seemed
to
me
,
from
the
action
of
her
lips
,
again
to
murmur
that
it
would
be
attended
to
immediate
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
,
"
said
the
milkman
,
looking
hard
at
her
for
the
first
time
,
and
taking
her
by
the
chin
,
"
are
you
fond
of
milk
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
likes
it
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
,
"
said
the
milkman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
wo
n't
have
none
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
D'ye
hear
?
 
<EOS>
Not
a
fragment
of
milk
<EOS>
you
wo
n't
have
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
thought
she
seemed
,
upon
the
whole
,
relieved
by
the
prospect
of
having
any
today
.
 
<EOS>
The
milkman
,
after
shaking
his
head
at
her
darkly
,
released
her
chin
,
and
with
anything
rather
than
good
-
will
opened
his
can
,
and
deposited
the
usual
quantity
in
the
family
jug
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
went
away
,
muttering
,
and
uttered
the
cry
of
his
trade
next
door
,
in
a
vindictive
shriek
.
   
<EOS>
"
Does
Mr
Traddles
live
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
then
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
A
mysterious
voice
from
the
end
of
the
passage
replied
"
Yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
the
youthful
servant
replied
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
at
home
?
"
said
I.
   
Again
the
mysterious
voice
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
and
again
the
servant
echoed
it
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
I
walked
in
,
and
in
pursuance
of
the
servant
's
directions
walked
upstairs
;
conscious
,
as
I
passed
the
back
parlour
-
door
,
that
I
was
surveyed
by
a
mysterious
eye
,
probably
belonging
to
the
mysterious
voice
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
got
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
---
the
house
was
only
a
story
high
above
the
ground
floor
---
Traddles
was
on
the
landing
to
meet
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
delighted
to
see
me
,
and
gave
me
welcome
,
with
great
heartiness
,
to
his
little
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
front
of
the
house
,
and
extremely
neat
,
though
sparely
furnished
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
his
only
room
<EOS>
,
I
saw
;
for
there
was
a
sofa
-
bedstead
in
it
,
and
his
blacking
-
brushes
and
blacking
were
among
his
books
---
on
the
top
shelf
,
behind
a
dictionary
.
 
<EOS>
His
table
was
covered
with
papers
,
and
he
was
hard
at
work
in
an
old
coat
.
 
<EOS>
I
looked
at
nothing
,
<EOS>
that
I
know
of
,
but
I
saw
everything
,
even
to
the
prospect
of
a
church
upon
his
china
inkstand
,
as
I
sat
down
---
and
this
,
too
,
was
a
faculty
confirmed
in
me
in
the
old
Micawber
times
.
 
<EOS>
Various
ingenious
arrangements
he
had
made
,
for
the
disguise
of
his
chest
of
drawers
,
and
the
accommodation
of
his
boots
,
his
shaving
-
glass
,
and
so
forth
,
particularly
impressed
themselves
upon
me
,
as
evidences
of
the
same
Traddles
who
used
to
make
models
of
elephants
'
dens
in
writing
-
paper
to
put
flies
in
;
and
to
comfort
himself
under
ill
usage
,
with
the
memorable
works
of
art
I
have
so
often
mentioned
.
   
<EOS>
In
a
corner
of
the
room
was
something
neatly
covered
up
with
a
large
white
cloth
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
make
out
what
that
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
Traddles
,
"
said
I
,
shaking
hands
with
him
again
,
after
I
had
sat
down
,
"
I
am
delighted
to
see
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
delighted
to
see
YOU
,
Copperfield
,
"
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
indeed
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
because
I
was
thoroughly
glad
to
see
you
when
we
met
in
Ely
Place
,
and
was
sure
you
were
thoroughly
glad
to
see
me
,
that
I
gave
you
this
address
instead
of
my
address
at
chambers
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
chambers
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
have
the
fourth
of
a
room
and
a
passage
,
and
the
fourth
of
a
clerk
,
"
returned
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Three
others
and
myself
unite
to
have
a
set
of
chambers
---
to
look
business
-
like
---
and
we
quarter
the
clerk
too
.
 
<EOS>
Half
-
a
-
crown
a
week
he
costs
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
old
simple
character
and
good
temper
,
and
something
of
his
old
unlucky
fortune
also
<EOS>
,
I
thought
,
smiled
at
me
in
the
smile
with
which
he
made
this
explanation
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
because
I
have
the
least
pride
<EOS>
,
Copperfield
,
you
understand
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
that
I
do
n't
usually
give
my
address
here
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
only
on
account
of
those
who
come
to
me
,
who
might
not
like
to
come
here
.
 
<EOS>
For
myself
,
I
am
fighting
my
way
on
in
the
world
against
difficulties
,
and
it
would
be
ridiculous
if
I
made
a
pretence
of
doing
anything
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
reading
for
the
bar
,
Mr
Waterbrook
informed
me
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
"
said
Traddles
,
rubbing
his
hands
slowly
over
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
reading
for
the
bar
.
 
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
I
have
just
begun
to
keep
my
terms
,
after
rather
a
long
delay
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
some
time
since
I
was
articled
,
but
the
payment
of
that
hundred
pounds
was
a
great
pull
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
pull
!
<EOS>
"
said
Traddles
,
with
a
wince
,
as
if
he
had
had
a
tooth
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
what
I
ca
n't
help
thinking
of
,
Traddles
,
as
I
sit
here
looking
at
you
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
he
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
sky
-
blue
suit
you
used
to
wear
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
,
to
be
sure
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Traddles
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tight
in
the
arms
and
legs
,
you
know
?
 
<EOS>
Dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
Those
were
happy
times
,
were
n't
they
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
our
schoolmaster
might
have
made
them
happier
,
without
doing
any
harm
to
any
of
us
<EOS>
,
I
acknowledge
,
"
I
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
might
,
"
said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
dear
me
,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
fun
going
on
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
the
nights
in
the
bedroom
?
<EOS>
When
we
used
to
have
the
suppers
?
 
<EOS>
And
when
you
used
to
tell
the
stories
?
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
And
do
you
remember
when
I
got
caned
for
crying
about
Mr
Mell
?
 
<EOS>
Old
Creakle
!
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
him
again
,
too
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
a
brute
to
you
,
Traddles
,
"
said
I
,
indignantly
;
for
his
good
humour
made
me
feel
as
if
I
had
seen
him
beaten
but
yesterday
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
so
?
"
returned
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Really
?
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
was
rather
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
all
over
,
a
long
while
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Creakle
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
were
brought
up
by
an
uncle
,
then
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
was
!
"
said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
one
I
was
always
going
to
write
to
.
 
<EOS>
And
always
did
n't
,
eh
!
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
had
an
uncle
then
.
 
<EOS>
He
died
soon
after
I
left
school
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
retired
---
what
do
you
call
it
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
draper
---
cloth
-
merchant
---
and
had
made
me
his
heir
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
did
n't
like
me
when
I
grew
up
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
really
mean
that
?
"
said
<EOS>
I.
 
He
was
so
composed
,
that
I
fancied
he
must
have
some
other

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
,
yes
,
Copperfield
!
 
<EOS>
I
mean
it
,
"
replied
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
an
unfortunate
thing
,
but
he
did
n't
like
me
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
I
was
n't
at
all
what
he
expected
,
and
so
he
married
his
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
do
anything
in
particular
,
"
said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
lived
with
them
,
waiting
to
be
put
out
in
the
world
,
until
his
gout
unfortunately
flew
to
his
stomach
---
and
so
he
died
,
and
so
she
married
a
young
man
,
and
<EOS>
so
I
was
n't
provided
for
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
get
nothing
,
Traddles
,
after
all
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
yes
!
"
said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
got
fifty
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
never
been
brought
up
to
any
profession
,
and
at
first
I
was
at
a
loss
what
to
do
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
began
,
with
the
assistance
of
the
son
of
a
professional
man
,
who
had
been
to
Salem
House
---
Yawler
,
with
his
nose
on
one
side
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
recollect
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
there
with
me
;
all
the
noses
were
straight
in
my
day
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
do
n't
matter
,
"
said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
began
,
by
means
of
his
assistance
,
to
copy
law
writings
.
 
<EOS>
That
did
n't
answer
very
well
;
and
then
I
began
to
state
cases
for
them
,
and
make
abstracts
,
and
that
sort
of
work
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
am
a
plodding
kind
of
fellow
,
Copperfield
,
and
had
learnt
the
way
of
doing
such
things
pithily
.
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
That
put
it
in
my
head
to
enter
myself
as
a
law
student
;
and
that
ran
away
with
all
that
was
left
of
the
fifty
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
Yawler
recommended
me
to
one
or
two
other
offices
,
however
---
<EOS>
Mr
Waterbrook
's
for
one
---
and
I
got
a
good
many
jobs
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
fortunate
enough
,
too
,
to
become
acquainted
with
a
person
in
the
publishing
way
,
who
was
getting
up
an
Encyclopaedia
,
and
he
set
me
to
work
;
and
,
indeed
"
(
glancing
at
his
table
)
<EOS>
,
"
I
am
at
work
for
him
at
this
minute
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
bad
compiler
,
Copperfield
,
"
said
Traddles
,
preserving
the
same
air
of
cheerful
confidence
in
all
he
said
,
"
but
I
have
no
invention
at
all
;
not
a
particle
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
there
never
was
a
young
man
with
less
originality
than
I
have
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Traddles
seemed
to
expect
that
I
should
assent
to
this
as
a
matter
of
course
,
I
nodded
;
and
he
went
on
,
with
the
same
sprightly
patience
---
I
can
find
no
better
expression
---
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
,
by
little
and
little
,
and
not
living
high
,
I
managed
to
scrape
up
the
hundred
pounds
at
last
,
"
said
Traddles
;
"
and
thank
Heaven
that
's
paid
---
though
it
was
---
though
it
certainly
was
,
"
said
Traddles
,
wincing
again
as
if
he
had
had
another
tooth
out
,
"
a
pull
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
living
by
the
sort
of
work
I
have
mentioned
,
still
,
and
I
hope
,
one
of
these
days
,
to
get
connected
with
some
newspaper
:
which
would
almost
be
the
making
of
my
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Copperfield
,
you
are
so
exactly
what
you
used
to
be
,
with
that
agreeable
face
,
and
it
's
so
pleasant
to
see
you
,
that
I
sha'n't
conceal
anything
.
<EOS>
Therefore
you
must
know
that
I
am
engaged
.
<EOS>
"
   
Engaged
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Dora
!
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
curate
's
daughter
,
"
said
Traddles
;
"
one
of
ten
,
down
in
Devonshire
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
!
"
<EOS>
For
he
saw
me
glance
,
involuntarily
,
at
the
prospect
on
the
inkstand
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
church
!
 
<EOS>
You
come
round
here
to
the
left
,
out
of
this
gate
,
"
tracing
his
finger
along
the
inkstand
,
"
and
exactly
where
I
hold
this
pen
<EOS>
,
there
stands
the
house
---
facing
,
you
understand
,
towards
the
church
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
delight
with
which
he
entered
into
these
particulars
,
did
not
fully
present
itself
to
me
until
afterwards
;
for
my
selfish
thoughts
were
making
a
ground
-
plan
of
Mr
Spenlow
's
house
and
garden
at
the
same
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
such
a
dear
girl
!
"
<EOS>
said
Traddles
;
"
a
little
older
than
me
,
but
the
dearest
girl
!
 
<EOS>
I
told
you
I
was
going
out
of
town
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
down
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
there
,
and
I
walked
back
,
and
I
had
the
most
delightful
time
!
 
<EOS>
I
dare
<EOS>
say
ours
is
likely
to
be
a
rather
long
engagement
,
but
our
motto
is
"
Wait
and
hope
!
<EOS>
"
We
always
say
that
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wait
and
hope
<EOS>
,
"
we
always
say
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
would
wait
,
Copperfield
,
till
she
was
sixty
---
any
age
you
can
mention
---
for
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Traddles
rose
from
his
chair
,
and
,
with
a
triumphant
smile
,
put
his
hand
upon
the
white
cloth
I
had
observed
.
   
<EOS>
"
However
,
"
he
said
,
"
it
's
not
that
we
have
n't
made
a
beginning
towards
housekeeping
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
;
we
have
begun
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
get
on
by
degrees
,
but
we
have
begun
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
"
drawing
the
cloth
off
with
great
pride
and
care
,
"
are
two
pieces
of
furniture
to
commence
with
.
 
<EOS>
This
flower
-
pot
and
stand
<EOS>
,
she
bought
herself
.
 
<EOS>
You
put
that
in
a
parlour
window
,
"
said
Traddles
,
falling
a
little
back
from
it
to
survey
it
with
the
greater
admiration
,
"
with
a
plant
in
it
,
and
<EOS>
---
and
there
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
This
little
round
table
with
the
marble
top
<EOS>
(
it
's
two
feet
ten
in
circumference
)
,
I
bought
.
 
<EOS>
You
want
to
lay
a
book
down
,
you
know
,
or
somebody
comes
to
see
you
or
your
wife
,
and
wants
a
place
to
stand
a
cup
of
tea
upon
,
and
---
and
there
you
are
again
!
"
<EOS>
said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
an
admirable
piece
of
workmanship
---
firm
as
a
rock
!
<EOS>
"
I
praised
them
both
,
highly
,
and
Traddles
replaced
the
covering
as
carefully
as
he
had
removed
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
a
great
deal
towards
the
furnishing
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
but
it
's
something
.
 
<EOS>
The
table
-
cloths
,
and
pillow
-
cases
,
and
articles
of
that
kind
,
are
what
discourage
me
most
,
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
So
does
the
ironmongery
---
candle
-
boxes
,
and
gridirons
,
and
that
sort
of
necessaries
---
because
those
things
tell
,
and
mount
up
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
"
wait
and
hope
!
"
<EOS>
And
I
assure
you
she
's
the
dearest
girl
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
certain
of
it
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
meantime
,
"
said
Traddles
,
coming
back
to
his
chair
;
"
and
this
is
the
end
of
my
prosing
about
myself
,
I
get
on
as
well
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
make
much
,
but
I
do
n't
spend
much
.
 
<EOS>
In
general
,
I
board
with
the
people
downstairs
,
who
are
very
agreeable
people
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Both
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
life
,
and
are
excellent
company
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Traddles
!
<EOS>
"
I
quickly
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
talking
about
?
"
   
<EOS>
Traddles
looked
at
me
,
as
if
he
wondered
what
I
was
talking
about
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
!
"
I
repeated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
am
intimately
acquainted
with
them
!
"
   
<EOS>
An
opportune
double
knock
at
the
door
,
which
I
knew
well
from
old
experience
in
Windsor
Terrace
,
and
which
nobody
but
Mr
Micawber
could
ever
have
knocked
at
that
door
,
resolved
any
doubt
in
my
mind
as
to
their
being
my
old
friends
.
 
<EOS>
I
begged
Traddles
to
ask
his
landlord
to
walk
up
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
accordingly
did
so
,
over
the
banister
;
and
Mr
Micawber
,
not
a
bit
changed
---
his
tights
,
his
stick
,
his
shirt
-
collar
,
and
his
eye
-
glass
,
all
the
same
as
ever
---
came
into
the
room
with
a
genteel
and
youthful
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr
Traddles
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
with
the
old
roll
in
his
voice
,
as
he
checked
himself
in
humming
a
soft
tune
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
aware
that
there
was
any
individual
,
alien
to
this
tenement
,
in
your
sanctum
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
slightly
bowed
to
me
,
and
pulled
up
his
shirt
-
collar
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Mr
Micawber
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
you
are
exceedingly
obliging
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
in
statu
quo
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
And
Mrs
Micawber
?
<EOS>
"
I
pursued
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
she
is
also
,
thank
God
,
in
statu
quo
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
And
the
children
,
Mr
Micawber
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
I
rejoice
to
reply
that
they
are
,
likewise
,
in
the
enjoyment
of
salubrity
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
Mr
Micawber
had
not
known
me
in
the
least
,
though
he
had
stood
face
to
face
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
,
seeing
me
smile
,
he
examined
my
features
with
more
attention
,
fell
back
,
cried
,
"
Is
it
possible
!
 
<EOS>
Have
I
the
pleasure
of
again
beholding
Copperfield
!
"
and
shook
me
by
both
hands
with
the
utmost
fervour
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
Heaven
,
Mr
Traddles
!
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
to
think
that
I
should
find
you
acquainted
with
the
friend
of
my
youth
,
the
companion
of
earlier
days
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
!
"
<EOS>
calling
over
the
banisters
to
Mrs
Micawber
,
while
Traddles
looked
(
with
reason
)
not
a
little
amazed
at
this
description
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
is
a
gentleman
in
Mr
Traddles
's
apartment
,
whom
he
wishes
to
have
the
pleasure
of
presenting
to
you
,
my
love
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
immediately
reappeared
,
and
shook
hands
with
me
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
is
our
good
friend
the
Doctor
,
Copperfield
?
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
and
all
the
circle
at
Canterbury
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
none
but
good
accounts
of
them
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
most
delighted
to
hear
it
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
at
Canterbury
where
we
last
met
.
 
<EOS>
Within
the
shadow
,
I
may
figuratively
say
,
of
that
religious
edifice
immortalized
by
Chaucer
,
which
was
anciently
the
resort
of
Pilgrims
from
the
remotest
corners
of
---
in
short
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
Cathedral
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
replied
that
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
continued
talking
as
volubly
as
he
could
;
but
not
,
I
thought
,
without
showing
,
by
some
marks
of
concern
in
his
countenance
,
that
he
was
sensible
of
sounds
in
the
next
room
,
as
of
Mrs
Micawber
washing
her
hands
,
and
hurriedly
opening
and
shutting
drawers
that
were
uneasy
in
their
action
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
find
us
,
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
with
one
eye
on
Traddles
,
"
at
present
established
,
on
what
may
be
designated
as
a
small
and
unassuming
scale
;
but
,
you
are
aware
that
I
have
,
in
the
course
of
my
career
,
surmounted
difficulties
,
and
conquered
obstacles
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
no
stranger
to
the
fact
<EOS>
,
that
there
have
been
periods
of
my
life
,
when
it
has
been
requisite
that
I
should
pause
,
until
certain
expected
events
should
turn
up
;
when
it
has
been
necessary
that
I
should
fall
back
,
before
making
what
I
trust
I
shall
not
be
accused
of
presumption
in
terming
---
a
spring
.
 
<EOS>
The
present
is
one
of
those
momentous
stages
in
the
life
of
man
.
 
<EOS>
You
find
me
,
fallen
back
,
FOR
a
spring
;
and
I
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
a
vigorous
leap
will
shortly
be
the
result
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
expressing
my
satisfaction
,
when
Mrs
Micawber
came
in
;
a
little
more
slatternly
than
she
used
to
be
,
or
so
she
seemed
now
,
to
my
unaccustomed
eyes
,
but
still
with
some
preparation
of
herself
for
company
,
and
with
a
pair
of
brown
gloves
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
leading
her
towards
me
,
"
here
is
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
Copperfield
,
who
wishes
to
renew
his
acquaintance
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
better
,
as
it
turned
out
,
to
have
led
gently
up
to
this
announcement
,
for
Mrs
Micawber
,
being
in
a
delicate
state
of
health
,
was
overcome
by
it
,
and
was
taken
so
unwell
,
that
Mr
Micawber
was
obliged
,
in
great
trepidation
,
to
run
down
to
the
water
-
butt
in
the
backyard
,
and
draw
a
basinful
to
lave
her
brow
with
.
 
<EOS>
She
presently
revived
,
however
,
and
was
really
pleased
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
half
-
an
-
hour
's
talk
,
all
together
;
and
I
asked
her
about
the
twins
,
who
,
she
said
,
were
"
grown
great
creatures
"
;
and
after
Master
and
Miss
Micawber
,
whom
she
described
as
"
absolute
giants
"
,
but
they
were
not
produced
on
that
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
was
very
anxious
that
I
should
stay
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
been
averse
to
do
so
,
but
that
I
imagined
I
detected
trouble
,
and
calculation
relative
to
the
extent
of
the
cold
meat
,
in
Mrs
Micawber
's
eye
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
pleaded
another
engagement
;
and
observing
that
Mrs
Micawber
's
spirits
were
immediately
lightened
,
I
resisted
all
persuasion
to
forego
it
.
   
<EOS>
But
I
told
Traddles
,
and
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
,
that
before
I
could
think
of
leaving
,
they
must
appoint
a
day
when
they
would
come
and
dine
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
occupations
to
which
Traddles
stood
pledged
,
rendered
it
necessary
to
fix
a
somewhat
distant
one
;
but
an
appointment
was
made
for
the
purpose
,
that
suited
us
all
,
and
then
I
took
my
leave
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
under
pretence
of
showing
me
a
nearer
way
than
that
by
which
I
had
come
,
accompanied
me
to
the
corner
of
the
street
;
being
anxious
(
he
explained
to
me
)
to
say
a
few
words
to
an
old
friend
,
in
confidence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
I
need
hardly
tell
you
that
to
have
beneath
our
roof
,
under
existing
circumstances
,
a
mind
like
that
which
gleams
---
<EOS>
if
I
may
be
allowed
the
expression
---
which
gleams
---
in
your
friend
Traddles
,
is
an
unspeakable
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
washerwoman
,
who
exposes
hard
-
bake
for
sale
in
her
parlour
-
window
,
dwelling
next
door
,
and
a
Bow
-
street
officer
residing
over
the
way
,
you
may
imagine
that
his
society
is
a
source
of
consolation
to
myself
and
to
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
at
present
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Copperfield
,
engaged
in
the
sale
of
corn
upon
commission
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
an
avocation
of
a
remunerative
description
---
in
other
words
,
it
does
not
pay
---
and
some
temporary
embarrassments
of
a
pecuniary
nature
have
been
the
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
,
however
,
delighted
to
add
that
I
have
now
an
immediate
prospect
of
something
turning
up
<EOS>
(
I
am
not
at
liberty
to
say
in
what
direction
)
,
which
I
trust
will
enable
me
to
provide
,
permanently
,
both
for
myself
and
for
your
friend
Traddles
,
in
whom
I
have
an
unaffected
interest
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
,
perhaps
,
be
prepared
to
hear
that
Mrs
Micawber
is
in
a
state
of
health
which
renders
it
not
wholly
improbable
that
an
addition
may
be
ultimately
made
to
those
pledges
of
affection
which
---
in
short
,
to
the
infantine
group
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
's
family
have
been
so
good
as
to
express
their
dissatisfaction
at
this
state
of
things
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
merely
to
observe
,
that
I
am
not
aware
that
it
is
any
business
of
theirs
,
and
that
I
repel
that
exhibition
of
feeling
with
scorn
,
and
with
defiance
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
then
shook
hands
with
me
again
,
and
left
me
.
      
<EOS>
Chapter
28
.
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
's
gauntlet
 
<EOS>
Until
the
day
arrived
on
which
I
was
to
entertain
my
newly
-
found
old
friends
,
I
lived
principally
on
Dora
and
coffee
.
 
<EOS>
In
my
love
-
lorn
condition
,
my
appetite
languished
;
and
I
was
glad
of
it
,
for
I
felt
as
though
it
would
have
been
an
act
of
perfidy
towards
Dora
to
have
a
natural
relish
for
my
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
The
quantity
of
walking
exercise
I
took
,
was
not
in
this
respect
attended
with
its
usual
consequence
,
as
the
disappointment
counteracted
the
fresh
air
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
my
doubts
,
too
,
founded
on
the
acute
experience
acquired
at
this
period
of
my
life
,
whether
a
sound
enjoyment
of
animal
food
can
develop
itself
freely
in
any
human
subject
who
is
always
in
torment
from
tight
boots
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
extremities
require
to
be
at
peace
before
the
stomach
will
conduct
itself
with
vigour
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
occasion
of
this
domestic
little
party
,
I
did
not
repeat
my
former
extensive
preparations
.
 
<EOS>
I
merely
provided
a
pair
of
soles
,
a
small
leg
of
mutton
,
and
a
pigeon
-
pie
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Crupp
broke
out
into
rebellion
on
my
first
bashful
hint
in
reference
to
the
cooking
of
the
fish
and
joint
,
and
said
,
with
a
dignified
sense
of
injury
,
"
No
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
ask
me
sich
a
thing
,
for
you
are
better
acquainted
with
me
than
to
suppose
me
capable
of
doing
what
I
can
not
do
with
ampial
satisfaction
to
my
own
feelings
!
"
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
end
,
a
compromise
was
effected
;
and
Mrs
Crupp
consented
to
achieve
this
feat
,
on
condition
that
I
dined
from
home
for
a
fortnight
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
And
here
I
may
remark
,
that
what
I
underwent
from
Mrs
Crupp
,
in
consequence
of
the
tyranny
she
established
over
me
,
was
dreadful
.
<EOS>
I
never
was
so
much
afraid
of
anyone
.
 
<EOS>
We
made
a
compromise
of
everything
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
hesitated
,
she
was
taken
with
that
wonderful
disorder
which
was
always
lying
in
ambush
in
her
system
,
ready
,
at
the
shortest
notice
,
to
prey
upon
her
vitals
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
rang
the
bell
impatiently
,
after
half
-
a
-
dozen
unavailing
modest
pulls
,
and
she
appeared
at
last
---
which
was
not
by
any
means
to
be
relied
upon
---
she
would
appear
with
a
reproachful
aspect
,
sink
breathless
on
a
chair
near
the
door
,
lay
her
hand
upon
her
nankeen
bosom
,
and
become
so
ill
,
that
I
was
glad
,
at
any
sacrifice
of
brandy
or
anything
else
,
to
get
rid
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
objected
to
having
my
bed
made
at
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
---
which
I
do
still
think
an
uncomfortable
arrangement
---
one
motion
of
her
hand
towards
the
same
nankeen
region
of
wounded
sensibility
was
enough
to
make
me
falter
an
apology
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
would
have
done
anything
in
an
honourable
way
rather
than
give
Mrs
Crupp
offence
;
and
she
was
the
terror
of
my
life
.
   
<EOS>
I
bought
a
second
-
hand
dumb
-
waiter
for
this
dinner
-
party
,
in
preference
to
re
-
engaging
the
handy
young
man
;
against
whom
I
had
conceived
a
prejudice
,
in
consequence
of
meeting
him
in
the
Strand
,
one
Sunday
morning
,
in
a
waistcoat
remarkably
like
one
of
mine
,
which
had
been
missing
since
the
former
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
The
"
young
gal
"
was
re
-
engaged
;
but
on
the
stipulation
that
she
should
only
bring
in
the
dishes
,
and
then
withdraw
to
the
landing
-
place
,
beyond
the
outer
door
;
where
a
habit
of
sniffing
she
had
contracted
would
be
lost
upon
the
guests
,
and
where
her
retiring
on
the
plates
would
be
a
physical
impossibility
.
   
<EOS>
Having
laid
in
the
materials
for
a
bowl
of
punch
,
to
be
compounded
by
Mr
Micawber
;
having
provided
a
bottle
of
lavender
-
water
,
two
wax
-
candles
,
a
paper
of
mixed
pins
,
and
a
pincushion
,
to
assist
Mrs
Micawber
in
her
toilette
at
my
dressing
-
table
;
having
also
caused
the
fire
in
my
bedroom
to
be
lighted
for
Mrs
Micawber
's
convenience
;
and
having
laid
the
cloth
with
my
own
hands
,
I
awaited
the
result
with
composure
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
appointed
time
,
my
three
visitors
arrived
together
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
with
more
shirt
-
collar
than
usual
,
and
a
new
ribbon
to
his
eye
-
glass
;
Mrs
Micawber
with
her
cap
in
a
whitey
-
brown
paper
parcel
;
Traddles
carrying
the
parcel
,
and
supporting
Mrs
Micawber
on
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
all
delighted
with
my
residence
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
conducted
Mrs
Micawber
to
my
dressing
-
table
,
and
she
saw
the
scale
on
which
it
was
prepared
for
her
,
she
was
in
such
raptures
,
that
she
called
Mr
Micawber
to
come
in
and
look
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
this
is
luxurious
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
way
of
life
which
reminds
me
of
the
period
when
I
was
myself
in
a
state
of
celibacy
,
and
Mrs
Micawber
had
not
yet
been
solicited
to
plight
her
faith
at
the
Hymeneal
altar
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
means
,
solicited
by
him
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
archly
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
can
not
answer
for
others
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
returned
Mr
Micawber
with
sudden
seriousness
,
"
I
have
no
desire
to
answer
for
others
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
too
well
aware
that
when
,
in
the
inscrutable
decrees
of
Fate
,
you
were
reserved
for
me
,
it
is
possible
you
may
have
been
reserved
for
one
,
<EOS>
destined
,
after
a
protracted
struggle
,
at
length
to
fall
a
victim
to
pecuniary
involvements
of
a
complicated
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
understand
your
allusion
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
I
regret
it
,
but
I
can
bear
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Micawber
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Micawber
,
in
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
I
deserved
this
!
 
<EOS>
I
,
who
never
have
deserted
you
;
who
never
WILL
desert
you
,
Micawber
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
much
affected
,
"
you
will
forgive
,
and
our
old
and
tried
friend
<EOS>
Copperfield
will
,
I
am
sure
,
forgive
,
the
momentary
laceration
of
a
wounded
spirit
,
made
sensitive
by
a
recent
collision
with
the
Minion
of
Power
---
in
other
words
,
with
a
ribald
Turncock
attached
to
the
water
-
works
---
and
will
pity
,
not
condemn
,
its
excesses
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
then
embraced
Mrs
Micawber
,
and
pressed
my
hand
;
leaving
me
to
infer
from
this
broken
allusion
that
his
domestic
supply
of
water
had
been
cut
off
that
afternoon
,
in
consequence
of
default
in
the
payment
of
the
company
's
rates
.
   
<EOS>
To
divert
his
thoughts
from
this
melancholy
subject
,
I
informed
Mr
Micawber
that
I
relied
upon
him
for
a
bowl
of
punch
,
and
led
him
to
the
lemons
.
 
<EOS>
His
recent
despondency
,
not
to
say
despair
,
was
gone
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
a
man
so
thoroughly
enjoy
himself
amid
the
fragrance
of
lemon
-
peel
and
sugar
,
the
odour
of
burning
rum
,
and
the
steam
of
boiling
water
,
as
Mr
Micawber
did
that
afternoon
.
<EOS>
It
was
wonderful
to
see
his
face
shining
at
us
out
of
a
thin
cloud
of
these
delicate
fumes
,
as
he
stirred
,
and
mixed
,
and
tasted
,
and
looked
as
if
he
were
making
,
instead
of
punch
,
a
fortune
for
his
family
down
to
the
latest
posterity
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
Mrs
Micawber
,
I
do
n't
know
whether
it
was
the
effect
of
the
cap
,
or
the
lavender
-
water
,
or
the
pins
,
or
the
fire
,
or
the
wax
-
candles
,
but
she
came
out
of
my
room
,
comparatively
speaking
,
lovely
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
lark
was
never
gayer
than
that
excellent
woman
.
   
<EOS>
I
suppose
---
I
never
ventured
to
inquire
,
but
I
suppose
---
that
Mrs
Crupp
,
after
frying
the
soles
,
was
taken
ill
.
 
<EOS>
Because
we
broke
down
at
that
point
.
 
<EOS>
The
leg
of
mutton
came
up
very
red
within
,
and
very
pale
without
:
besides
having
a
foreign
substance
of
a
gritty
nature
sprinkled
over
it
,
as
if
if
had
had
a
fall
into
the
ashes
of
that
remarkable
kitchen
fireplace
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
were
not
in
condition
to
judge
of
this
fact
from
the
appearance
of
the
gravy
,
forasmuch
as
the
"
young
gal
"
<EOS>
had
dropped
it
all
upon
the
stairs
---
where
it
remained
,
by
the
by
,
in
a
long
train
,
until
it
was
worn
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
pigeon
-
pie
was
not
bad
,
but
it
was
a
delusive
pie
:
the
crust
being
like
a
disappointing
head
,
phrenologically
speaking
:
<EOS>
full
of
lumps
and
bumps
,
with
nothing
particular
underneath
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
banquet
was
such
a
failure
that
I
should
have
been
quite
unhappy
---
about
the
failure
,
I
mean
,
for
I
was
always
unhappy
about
Dora
---
if
I
had
not
been
relieved
by
the
great
good
humour
of
my
company
,
and
by
a
bright
suggestion
from
Mr
Micawber
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
friend
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
accidents
will
occur
in
the
best
-
regulated
families
;
and
in
families
not
regulated
by
that
pervading
influence
which
sanctifies
while
it
enhances
the
---
<EOS>
a
---
I
would
say
,
in
short
,
by
the
influence
of
Woman
,
in
the
lofty
character
of
Wife
<EOS>
,
they
may
be
expected
with
confidence
,
and
must
be
borne
with
philosophy
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
will
allow
me
to
take
the
liberty
of
remarking
that
there
are
few
comestibles
better
,
in
their
way
,
than
a
Devil
,
and
that
I
believe
,
with
a
little
division
of
labour
,
we
could
accomplish
a
good
one
if
the
young
person
in
attendance
could
produce
a
gridiron
,
I
would
put
it
to
you
,
that
this
little
misfortune
may
be
easily
repaired
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
gridiron
in
the
pantry
,
on
which
my
morning
rasher
of
bacon
was
cooked
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
it
in
,
in
a
twinkling
,
and
immediately
applied
ourselves
to
carrying
Mr
Micawber
's
idea
into
effect
.
 
<EOS>
The
division
of
labour
to
which
he
had
referred
was
this
:
---
<EOS>
Traddles
cut
the
mutton
into
slices
;
Mr
Micawber
(
who
could
do
anything
of
this
sort
to
perfection
)
covered
them
with
pepper
,
mustard
,
salt
,
and
cayenne
;
I
put
them
on
the
gridiron
,
turned
them
with
a
fork
,
and
took
them
off
,
under
Mr
Micawber
's
direction
;
and
Mrs
Micawber
heated
,
and
continually
stirred
,
some
mushroom
ketchup
in
a
little
saucepan
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
had
slices
enough
done
to
begin
upon
,
we
fell
-
to
,
with
our
sleeves
still
tucked
up
at
the
wrist
,
more
slices
sputtering
and
blazing
on
the
fire
,
and
our
attention
divided
between
the
mutton
on
our
plates
,
and
the
mutton
then
preparing
.
   
<EOS>
What
with
the
novelty
of
this
cookery
,
the
excellence
of
it
,
the
bustle
of
it
,
the
frequent
starting
up
to
look
after
it
,
the
frequent
sitting
down
to
dispose
of
it
as
the
crisp
slices
came
off
the
gridiron
hot
and
hot
,
the
being
so
busy
,
so
flushed
with
the
fire
,
so
amused
,
and
in
the
midst
of
such
a
tempting
noise
and
savour
,
we
reduced
the
leg
of
mutton
to
the
bone
.
 
<EOS>
My
own
appetite
came
back
miraculously
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
ashamed
to
record
it
,
but
I
really
believe
I
forgot
Dora
for
a
little
while
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
satisfied
that
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
could
not
have
enjoyed
the
feast
more
,
if
they
had
sold
a
bed
to
provide
it
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
laughed
as
heartily
,
almost
the
whole
time
,
as
he
ate
and
worked
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
we
all
did
,
all
at
once
;
and
I
dare
say
there
was
never
a
greater
success
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
at
the
height
of
our
enjoyment
,
and
were
all
busily
engaged
,
in
our
several
departments
,
endeavouring
to
bring
the
last
batch
of
slices
to
a
state
of
perfection
that
should
crown
the
feast
,
when
I
was
aware
of
a
strange
presence
in
the
room
,
and
my
eyes
encountered
those
of
the
staid
Littimer
,
standing
hat
in
hand
before
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
I
involuntarily
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
I
was
directed
to
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
Is
my
master
not
here
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
not
seen
him
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
;
do
n't
you
come
from
him
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
immediately
so
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
he
tell
you
you
would
find
him
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
exactly
so
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
should
think
he
might
be
here
tomorrow
,
as
he
has
not
been
here
today
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
he
coming
up
from
Oxford
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
,
sir
,
"
he
returned
respectfully
,
"
that
you
will
be
seated
,
and
allow
me
to
do
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
which
he
took
the
fork
from
my
unresisting
hand
,
and
bent
over
the
gridiron
,
as
if
his
whole
attention
were
concentrated
on
it
.
   
<EOS>
We
should
not
have
been
much
discomposed
,
I
dare
say
,
by
the
appearance
of
Steerforth
himself
,
but
we
became
in
a
moment
the
meekest
of
the
meek
before
his
respectable
serving
-
man
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
humming
a
tune
,
to
show
that
he
was
quite
at
ease
,
subsided
into
his
chair
,
with
the
handle
of
a
hastily
concealed
fork
sticking
out
of
the
bosom
of
his
coat
,
as
if
he
had
stabbed
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
put
on
her
brown
gloves
,
and
assumed
a
genteel
languor
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
ran
his
greasy
hands
through
his
hair
,
and
stood
it
bolt
upright
,
and
stared
in
confusion
on
the
table
-
cloth
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
I
was
a
mere
infant
at
the
head
of
my
own
table
;
and
hardly
ventured
to
glance
at
the
respectable
phenomenon
,
who
had
come
from
Heaven
knows
where
,
to
put
my
establishment
to
rights
.
   
<EOS>
Meanwhile
he
took
the
mutton
off
the
gridiron
,
and
gravely
handed
it
round
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
took
some
,
but
our
appreciation
of
it
was
gone
,
and
we
merely
made
a
show
of
eating
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
severally
pushed
away
our
plates
,
he
noiselessly
removed
them
,
and
set
on
the
cheese
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
that
off
,
too
,
when
it
was
done
with
;
cleared
the
table
;
piled
everything
on
the
dumb
-
waiter
;
gave
us
our
wine
-
glasses
;
and
,
of
his
own
accord
,
wheeled
the
dumb
-
waiter
into
the
pantry
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
was
done
in
a
perfect
manner
,
and
he
never
raised
his
eyes
from
what
he
was
about
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
his
very
elbows
,
when
he
had
his
back
towards
me
,
seemed
to
teem
with
the
expression
of
his
fixed
opinion
that
I
was
extremely
young
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
I
do
anything
more
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
thanked
him
and
said
,
<EOS>
No
;
but
would
he
take
no
dinner
himself
?
   
<EOS>
"
None
,
I
am
obliged
to
you
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr
Steerforth
coming
from
Oxford
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr
Steerforth
coming
from
Oxford
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
imagine
that
he
might
be
here
tomorrow
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
rather
thought
he
might
have
been
here
today
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
The
mistake
is
mine
,
no
doubt
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
should
see
him
first
---
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
excuse
me
,
sir
,
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
see
him
first
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
case
you
do
,
"
said
I
,
"
pray
say
that
I
am
sorry
he
was
not
here
today
,
as
an
old
schoolfellow
of
his
was
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
divided
a
bow
between
me
and
Traddles
,
with
a
glance
at
the
latter
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
moving
softly
to
the
door
,
when
,
in
a
forlorn
hope
of
saying
something
naturally
---
which
I
never
could
,
to
this
man
---
I
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
Littimer
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
remain
long
at
Yarmouth
,
that
time
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
particularly
so
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
saw
the
boat
completed
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
remained
behind
on
purpose
to
see
the
boat
completed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
!
"
<EOS>
He
raised
his
eyes
to
mine
respectfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Steerforth
has
not
seen
it
yet
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
really
ca
n't
say
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
---
<EOS>
but
I
really
ca
n't
say
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
good
night
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
comprehended
everybody
present
,
in
the
respectful
bow
with
which
he
followed
these
words
,
and
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
My
visitors
seemed
to
breathe
more
freely
when
he
was
gone
;
but
my
own
relief
was
very
great
,
for
besides
the
constraint
,
arising
from
that
extraordinary
sense
of
being
at
a
disadvantage
which
I
always
had
in
this
man
's
presence
,
my
conscience
had
embarrassed
me
with
whispers
that
I
had
mistrusted
his
master
,
and
I
could
not
repress
a
vague
uneasy
dread
that
he
might
find
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
How
was
it
,
having
so
little
in
reality
to
conceal
<EOS>
,
that
I
always
DID
feel
as
if
this
man
were
finding
me
out
?
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
roused
me
from
this
reflection
,
which
was
blended
with
a
certain
remorseful
apprehension
of
seeing
Steerforth
himself
,
by
bestowing
many
encomiums
on
the
absent
Littimer
as
a
most
respectable
fellow
,
and
a
thoroughly
admirable
servant
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
I
may
remark
,
had
taken
his
full
share
of
the
general
bow
,
and
had
received
it
with
infinite
condescension
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
punch
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
tasting
it
,
"
like
time
and
tide
,
waits
for
no
man
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
it
is
at
the
present
moment
in
high
flavour
.
 
<EOS>
My
love
,
will
you
give
me
your
opinion
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
pronounced
it
excellent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
drink
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
if
my
friend
Copperfield
will
permit
me
to
take
that
social
liberty
,
to
the
days
when
my
friend
Copperfield
and
myself
were
younger
,
and
fought
our
way
in
the
world
side
by
side
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
say
,
of
myself
and
Copperfield
,
in
words
we
have
sung
together
before
now
,
that
   
<EOS>
"
We
twa
'
<EOS>
hae
run
about
the
braes
   
<EOS>
And
pu'd
<EOS>
the
gowans
fine
"
 
---
in
a
figurative
point
of
view
---
on
several
occasions
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
exactly
aware
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
with
the
old
roll
in
his
voice
,
and
the
old
indescribable
air
of
saying
something
genteel
,
"
what
gowans
may
be
,
but
I
have
no
doubt
that
Copperfield
and
myself
would
frequently
have
taken
a
pull
at
them
,
if
it
had
been
feasible
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
at
the
then
present
moment
,
took
a
pull
at
his
punch
.
<EOS>
So
we
all
did
:
<EOS>
Traddles
evidently
lost
in
wondering
at
what
distant
time
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
<EOS>
and
I
could
have
been
comrades
in
the
battle
of
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ahem
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
clearing
his
throat
,
and
warming
with
the
punch
and
with
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
another
glass
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
said
it
must
be
very
little
;
but
we
could
n't
allow
that
,
so
it
was
a
glassful
.
   
<EOS>
"
As
we
are
quite
confidential
here
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
sipping
her
punch
,
"
Mr
Traddles
being
a
part
of
our
domesticity
<EOS>
,
I
should
much
like
to
have
your
opinion
on
Mr
Micawber
's
prospects
.
 
<EOS>
For
corn
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
argumentatively
,
"
as
I
have
repeatedly
said
to
Mr
Micawber
,
may
be
gentlemanly
,
but
it
is
not
remunerative
.
 
<EOS>
Commission
to
the
extent
of
two
and
ninepence
in
a
fortnight
can
not
,
however
limited
our
ideas
,
be
considered
remunerative
.
"
   
<EOS>
We
were
all
agreed
upon
that
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
who
prided
herself
on
taking
a
clear
view
of
things
,
and
keeping
Mr
Micawber
straight
by
her
woman
's
wisdom
,
when
he
might
otherwise
go
a
little
crooked
,
"
then
I
ask
myself
this
question
.
 
<EOS>
If
corn
is
not
to
be
relied
upon
,
what
is
?
<EOS>
Are
coals
to
be
relied
upon
?
 
<EOS>
Not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
turned
our
attention
to
that
experiment
,
on
the
suggestion
of
my
family
,
and
we
find
it
fallacious
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
eyed
us
aside
,
and
nodded
his
head
,
as
much
as
to
say
that
the
case
was
very
clearly
put
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
articles
of
corn
and
coals
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
still
more
argumentatively
,
"
being
equally
out
of
the
question
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
I
naturally
look
round
the
world
,
and
say
,
"
What
is
there
in
which
a
person
of
Mr
Micawber
's
talent
is
likely
to
succeed
?
"
<EOS>
And
I
exclude
the
doing
anything
on
commission
,
because
commission
is
not
a
certainty
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
best
suited
to
a
person
of
Mr
Micawber
's
peculiar
temperament
is
,
I
am
convinced
,
a
certainty
.
"
   
<EOS>
Traddles
and
I
both
expressed
,
by
a
feeling
murmur
,
that
this
great
discovery
was
no
doubt
true
of
Mr
Micawber
,
and
that
it
did
him
much
credit
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
conceal
from
you
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
that
I
have
long
felt
the
Brewing
business
to
be
particularly
adapted
to
Mr
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
Barclay
and
Perkins
!
<EOS>
Look
at
Truman
,
Hanbury
,
and
Buxton
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
on
that
extensive
footing
that
Mr
Micawber
,
I
know
from
my
own
knowledge
of
him
,
is
calculated
to
shine
;
and
the
profits
,
I
am
told
,
are
e
-
NOR
-
MOUS
!
<EOS>
But
if
Mr
Micawber
can
not
get
into
those
firms
---
which
decline
to
answer
his
letters
,
when
he
offers
his
services
even
in
an
inferior
capacity
---
what
is
the
use
of
dwelling
upon
that
idea
?
 
<EOS>
None
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
a
conviction
that
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
's
manners
---
"
   
"
Hem
!
 
<EOS>
Really
,
my
dear
,
"
interposed
Mr
Micawber
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
be
silent
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
laying
her
brown
glove
on
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
may
have
a
conviction
,
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
that
Mr
Micawber
's
manners
peculiarly
qualify
him
for
the
Banking
business
.
<EOS>
I
may
argue
within
myself
,
that
if
I
had
a
deposit
at
a
banking
-
house
,
the
manners
of
Mr
Micawber
,
as
representing
that
banking
-
house
,
would
inspire
confidence
,
and
must
extend
the
connexion
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
the
various
banking
-
houses
refuse
to
avail
themselves
of
Mr
Micawber
's
abilities
,
or
receive
the
offer
of
them
with
contumely
,
what
is
the
use
of
dwelling
upon
THAT
idea
?
<EOS>
None
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
originating
a
banking
-
business
,
I
may
know
that
there
are
members
of
my
family
who
,
if
they
chose
to
place
their
money
in
Mr
Micawber
's
hands
,
might
found
an
establishment
of
that
description
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
they
do
NOT
choose
to
place
their
money
in
Mr
Micawber
's
hands
---
which
they
do
n't
---
what
is
the
use
of
that
?
<EOS>
Again
I
contend
that
we
are
no
farther
advanced
than
we
were
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
shook
my
head
,
and
said
,
"
Not
a
bit
.
"
 
<EOS>
Traddles
also
shook
his
head
,
and
said
,
"
Not
a
bit
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
I
deduce
from
this
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
went
on
to
say
,
still
with
the
same
air
of
putting
a
case
lucidly
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
conclusion
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
to
which
I
am
irresistibly
brought
?
 
<EOS>
Am
I
wrong
in
saying
<EOS>
,
it
is
clear
that
we
must
live
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
answered
"
Not
at
all
!
"
<EOS>
and
Traddles
answered
"
Not
at
all
!
"
<EOS>
and
I
found
myself
afterwards
sagely
adding
,
alone
,
that
a
person
must
either
live
or
die
.
   
<EOS>
"
Just
so
,
"
returned
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
It
is
precisely
that
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
fact
is
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
that
we
can
not
live
without
something
widely
different
from
existing
circumstances
shortly
turning
up
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
am
convinced
,
myself
,
and
<EOS>
this
I
have
pointed
out
to
Mr
Micawber
several
times
of
late
,
that
things
can
not
be
expected
to
turn
up
of
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
,
in
a
measure
,
assist
to
turn
them
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
be
wrong
,
but
I
have
formed
that
opinion
.
"
   
<EOS>
Both
Traddles
and
I
applauded
it
highly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
what
do
I
recommend
?
 
<EOS>
Here
is
Mr
Micawber
with
a
variety
of
qualifications
---
with
great
talent
---
"
   
"
Really
,
my
love
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
my
dear
,
allow
me
to
conclude
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
Mr
Micawber
,
with
a
variety
of
qualifications
,
with
great
talent
---
I
should
say
,
with
genius
,
but
that
may
be
the
partiality
of
a
wife
---
<EOS>
"
   
Traddles
and
I
both
murmured
"
No
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
And
here
is
Mr
Micawber
without
any
suitable
position
or
employment
.
 
<EOS>
Where
does
that
responsibility
rest
?
 
<EOS>
Clearly
on
society
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
would
make
a
fact
so
disgraceful
known
,
and
boldly
challenge
society
to
set
it
right
.
 
<EOS>
It
appears
to
me
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
forcibly
,
"
that
what
Mr
Micawber
has
to
do
,
is
to
throw
down
the
gauntlet
to
society
,
and
say
,
in
effect
,
"
Show
me
who
will
take
that
up
.
 
<EOS>
Let
the
party
immediately
step
forward
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
I
ventured
to
ask
Mrs
Micawber
how
this
was
to
be
done
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
advertising
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
---
"
in
all
the
papers
.
 
<EOS>
It
appears
to
me
,
that
what
Mr
Micawber
has
to
do
,
in
justice
to
himself
,
in
justice
to
his
family
,
and
I
will
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
in
justice
to
society
,
by
which
he
has
been
hitherto
overlooked
,
is
to
advertise
in
all
the
papers
;
to
describe
himself
plainly
as
so
-
and
-
so
,
with
such
and
such
qualifications
and
to
put
it
thus
:
"
<EOS>
Now
employ
me
,
on
remunerative
terms
,
and
address
,
post
-
paid
,
to
W*M
,
Post
Office
,
Camden
Town
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
This
idea
of
Mrs
Micawber
's
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
making
his
shirt
-
collar
meet
in
front
of
his
chin
,
and
glancing
at
me
sideways
,
"
is
,
in
fact
,
the
Leap
to
which
I
alluded
,
when
I
last
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Advertising
is
rather
expensive
,
"
I
remarked
,
dubiously
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Exactly
so
!
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
preserving
the
same
logical
air
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
true
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
made
the
identical
observation
to
Mr
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
for
that
reason
especially
,
that
I
think
Mr
Micawber
ought
(
as
I
have
already
said
,
in
justice
to
himself
,
in
justice
to
his
family
,
and
in
justice
to
society
)
to
raise
a
certain
sum
of
money
---
on
a
bill
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
trifled
with
his
eye
-
glass
and
cast
his
eyes
up
at
the
ceiling
;
but
I
thought
him
observant
of
Traddles
,
too
,
who
was
looking
at
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
no
member
of
my
family
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
is
possessed
of
sufficient
natural
feeling
to
negotiate
that
bill
<EOS>
---
I
believe
there
is
a
better
business
-
term
to
express
what
I
mean
---
"
   
Mr
Micawber
,
with
his
eyes
still
cast
up
at
the
ceiling
,
suggested
"
Discount
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
discount
that
bill
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
then
my
opinion
is
,
that
Mr
Micawber
should
go
into
the
City
,
should
take
that
bill
into
the
Money
Market
,
and
should
dispose
of
it
for
what
he
can
get
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
individuals
in
the
Money
Market
oblige
Mr
Micawber
to
sustain
a
great
sacrifice
,
that
is
between
themselves
and
their
consciences
.
 
<EOS>
I
view
it
,
steadily
,
as
an
investment
.
 
<EOS>
I
recommend
Mr
Micawber
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
to
do
the
same
;
to
regard
it
as
an
investment
which
is
sure
of
return
,
and
to
make
up
his
mind
to
any
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
felt
,
but
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
why
,
that
this
was
self
-
denying
and
devoted
in
Mrs
Micawber
,
and
I
uttered
a
murmur
to
that
effect
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
,
who
took
his
tone
from
me
,
did
likewise
,
still
looking
at
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
finishing
her
punch
,
and
gathering
her
scarf
about
her
shoulders
,
preparatory
to
her
withdrawal
to
my
bedroom
:
"
I
will
not
protract
these
remarks
on
the
subject
of
Mr
Micawber
's
pecuniary
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
At
your
fireside
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
and
in
the
presence
of
Mr
Traddles
,
who
,
though
not
so
old
a
friend
,
is
quite
one
of
ourselves
,
I
could
not
refrain
from
making
you
acquainted
with
the
course
I
advise
Mr
Micawber
to
take
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
the
time
is
arrived
when
Mr
Micawber
should
exert
himself
<EOS>
and
---
I
will
add
---
assert
himself
,
and
it
appears
to
me
that
these
are
the
means
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
aware
that
I
am
merely
a
female
,
and
that
a
masculine
judgement
is
usually
considered
more
competent
to
the
discussion
of
such
questions
;
still
I
must
not
forget
that
,
when
I
lived
at
home
with
my
papa
and
mama
,
my
papa
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
,
"
Emma
's
form
is
fragile
,
but
her
grasp
of
a
subject
is
inferior
to
none
.
<EOS>
"
That
my
papa
was
too
partial
,
I
well
know
;
but
that
he
was
an
observer
of
character
in
some
degree
,
my
duty
and
my
reason
equally
forbid
me
to
doubt
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
and
resisting
our
entreaties
that
she
would
grace
the
remaining
circulation
of
the
punch
with
her
presence
,
Mrs
Micawber
retired
to
my
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
And
really
I
felt
that
she
was
a
noble
woman
---
the
sort
of
woman
who
might
have
been
a
Roman
matron
,
and
done
all
manner
of
heroic
things
,
in
times
of
public
trouble
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
fervour
of
this
impression
,
I
congratulated
Mr
Micawber
on
the
treasure
he
possessed
.
 
<EOS>
So
did
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
extended
his
hand
to
each
of
us
in
succession
,
and
then
covered
his
face
with
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
which
I
think
had
more
snuff
upon
it
than
he
was
aware
of
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
returned
to
the
punch
,
in
the
highest
state
of
exhilaration
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
full
of
eloquence
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
us
to
understand
that
in
our
children
we
lived
again
,
and
that
,
under
the
pressure
of
pecuniary
difficulties
,
any
accession
to
their
number
was
doubly
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
that
Mrs
Micawber
had
latterly
had
her
doubts
on
this
point
,
but
that
he
had
dispelled
them
,
and
reassured
her
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
her
family
,
they
were
totally
unworthy
of
her
,
and
their
sentiments
were
utterly
indifferent
to
him
,
and
they
might
---
I
quote
his
own
expression
---
go
to
the
Devil
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
then
delivered
a
warm
eulogy
on
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
Traddles
's
was
a
character
,
to
the
steady
virtues
of
which
he
(
Mr
Micawber
)
could
lay
no
claim
,
but
which
,
he
thanked
Heaven
,
he
could
admire
.
 
<EOS>
He
feelingly
alluded
to
the
young
lady
,
unknown
,
whom
Traddles
had
honoured
with
his
affection
,
and
who
had
reciprocated
that
affection
by
honouring
and
blessing
Traddles
with
her
affection
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
pledged
her
.
 
<EOS>
So
did
I.
 
Traddles
thanked
us
both
,
by
saying
,
with
a
simplicity
and
honesty
<EOS>
I
had
sense
enough
to
be
quite
charmed
with
,
"
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
do
assure
you
,
she
's
the
dearest
girl
!
---
<EOS>
"
   
Mr
Micawber
took
an
early
opportunity
,
after
that
,
of
hinting
,
with
the
utmost
delicacy
and
ceremony
,
at
the
state
of
MY
affections
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
but
the
serious
assurance
of
his
friend
Copperfield
to
the
contrary
,
he
observed
,
could
deprive
him
of
the
impression
that
his
friend
Copperfield
loved
and
was
beloved
.
<EOS>
After
feeling
very
hot
and
uncomfortable
for
some
time
,
and
after
a
good
deal
of
blushing
,
stammering
,
and
denying
,
I
said
,
having
my
glass
in
my
hand
,
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
would
give
them
D
!
"
<EOS>
which
so
excited
and
gratified
Mr
Micawber
,
that
he
ran
with
a
glass
of
punch
into
my
bedroom
,
in
order
that
Mrs
Micawber
might
drink
D
,
who
drank
it
with
enthusiasm
,
crying
from
within
,
in
a
shrill
voice
,
"
Hear
,
hear
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
I
am
delighted
.
 
<EOS>
Hear
!
"
<EOS>
and
tapping
at
the
wall
,
by
way
of
applause
.
   
<EOS>
Our
conversation
,
afterwards
,
took
a
more
worldly
turn
;
Mr
Micawber
telling
us
that
he
found
Camden
Town
inconvenient
,
and
that
the
first
thing
he
contemplated
doing
,
when
the
advertisement
should
have
been
the
cause
of
something
satisfactory
turning
up
,
was
to
move
.
 
<EOS>
He
mentioned
a
terrace
at
the
western
end
of
Oxford
Street
,
fronting
Hyde
Park
,
on
which
he
had
always
had
his
eye
,
but
which
he
did
not
expect
to
attain
immediately
,
as
it
would
require
a
large
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
There
would
probably
be
an
interval
,
he
explained
,
in
which
he
should
content
himself
with
the
upper
part
of
a
house
,
over
some
respectable
place
of
business
---
say
in
Piccadilly
,
---
which
would
be
a
cheerful
situation
for
Mrs
Micawber
;
and
where
,
by
throwing
out
a
bow
-
window
,
or
carrying
up
the
roof
another
story
,
or
making
some
little
alteration
of
that
sort
,
they
might
live
,
comfortably
and
reputably
,
for
a
few
years
.
<EOS>
Whatever
was
reserved
for
him
,
he
expressly
said
,
or
wherever
his
abode
might
be
,
we
might
rely
on
this
---
there
would
always
be
a
room
for
Traddles
,
and
a
knife
and
fork
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
acknowledged
his
kindness
;
and
he
begged
us
to
forgive
his
having
launched
into
these
practical
and
business
-
like
details
,
and
to
excuse
it
as
natural
in
one
who
was
making
entirely
new
arrangements
in
life
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
,
tapping
at
the
wall
again
to
know
if
tea
were
ready
,
broke
up
this
particular
phase
of
our
friendly
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
She
made
tea
for
us
in
a
most
agreeable
manner
;
and
,
whenever
I
went
near
her
,
in
handing
about
the
tea
-
cups
and
bread
-
and
-
butter
,
asked
me
,
in
a
whisper
,
whether
D
was
fair
,
or
dark
,
or
whether
she
was
short
,
or
tall
:
or
something
of
that
kind
;
which
I
think
I
liked
.
<EOS>
After
tea
,
we
discussed
a
variety
of
topics
before
the
fire
;
and
Mrs
Micawber
was
good
enough
to
sing
us
(
in
a
small
,
thin
,
flat
voice
,
which
I
remembered
to
have
considered
,
when
I
first
knew
her
,
the
very
table
-
beer
of
acoustics
)
<EOS>
the
favourite
ballads
of
"
The
Dashing
White
Sergeant
"
,
and
"
Little
Tafflin
"
.
 
<EOS>
For
both
of
these
songs
Mrs
Micawber
had
been
famous
when
she
lived
at
home
with
her
papa
and
mama
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
told
us
,
that
when
he
heard
her
sing
the
first
one
,
on
the
first
occasion
of
his
seeing
her
beneath
the
parental
roof
,
she
had
attracted
his
attention
in
an
extraordinary
degree
;
but
that
when
it
came
to
Little
Tafflin
,
he
had
resolved
to
win
that
woman
or
perish
in
the
attempt
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
between
ten
and
eleven
o'clock
when
Mrs
Micawber
rose
to
replace
her
cap
in
the
whitey
-
brown
paper
parcel
,
and
to
put
on
her
bonnet
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
took
the
opportunity
of
Traddles
putting
on
his
great
-
coat
,
to
slip
a
letter
into
my
hand
,
with
a
whispered
request
that
I
would
read
it
at
my
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
I
also
took
the
opportunity
of
my
holding
a
candle
over
the
banisters
to
light
them
down
,
when
Mr
Micawber
was
going
first
,
leading
Mrs
Micawber
,
and
Traddles
was
following
with
the
cap
,
to
detain
Traddles
for
a
moment
on
the
top
of
the
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Traddles
,
"
said
I
,
"
Mr
Micawber
do
n't
mean
any
harm
,
poor
fellow
:
<EOS>
but
,
if
I
were
you
,
I
would
n't
lend
him
anything
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Copperfield
,
"
returned
Traddles
,
smiling
,
"
I
have
n't
got
anything
to
lend
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
got
a
name
,
you
know
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
call
THAT
something
to
lend
?
<EOS>
"
returned
Traddles
,
with
a
thoughtful
look
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
Copperfield
;
but
---
I
am
afraid
I
have
lent
him
that
already
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
the
bill
that
is
to
be
a
certain
investment
?
"
I
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
for
that
one
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
first
I
have
heard
of
that
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
thinking
that
he
will
most
likely
propose
that
one
,
on
the
way
home
.
 
<EOS>
Mine
's
another
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
there
will
be
nothing
wrong
about
it
,
"
said
I.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
not
,
though
,
because
he
told
me
,
only
the
other
day
,
that
it
was
provided
for
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
Mr
Micawber
's
expression
,
"
Provided
for
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
Mr
Micawber
looking
up
at
this
juncture
to
where
we
were
standing
,
I
had
only
time
to
repeat
my
caution
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
thanked
me
,
and
descended
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
much
afraid
,
when
I
observed
the
good
-
natured
manner
in
which
he
went
down
with
the
cap
in
his
hand
,
and
gave
Mrs
Micawber
his
arm
,
that
he
would
be
carried
into
the
Money
Market
neck
and
heels
.
   
<EOS>
I
returned
to
my
fireside
,
and
was
musing
,
half
gravely
and
half
laughing
,
on
the
character
of
Mr
Micawber
and
the
old
relations
between
us
,
when
I
heard
a
quick
step
ascending
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
I
thought
it
was
Traddles
coming
back
for
something
Mrs
Micawber
had
left
behind
;
but
as
the
step
approached
,
I
knew
it
,
and
felt
my
heart
beat
high
,
and
the
blood
rush
to
my
face
,
for
it
was
Steerforth
's
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
never
unmindful
of
Agnes
,
and
she
never
left
that
sanctuary
in
my
thoughts
---
if
I
may
call
it
so
---
where
I
had
placed
her
from
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
he
entered
,
and
stood
before
me
with
his
hand
out
,
the
darkness
that
had
fallen
on
him
changed
to
light
,
and
I
felt
confounded
and
ashamed
of
having
doubted
one
I
loved
so
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
I
loved
her
none
the
less
;
I
thought
of
her
as
the
same
benignant
,
gentle
angel
in
my
life
;
I
reproached
myself
,
not
her
,
with
having
done
him
an
injury
;
and
I
would
have
made
him
any
atonement
if
I
had
known
what
to
make
,
and
how
to
make
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Daisy
,
old
boy
,
dumb
-
foundered
!
"
<EOS>
laughed
Steerforth
,
shaking
my
hand
heartily
,
and
throwing
it
gaily
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
I
detected
you
in
another
feast
,
you
Sybarite
!
 
<EOS>
These
Doctors
'
Commons
fellows
are
the
gayest
men
in
town
,
I
believe
,
and
beat
us
sober
Oxford
people
all
to
nothing
!
"
<EOS>
His
bright
glance
went
merrily
round
the
room
,
as
he
took
the
seat
on
the
sofa
opposite
to
me
,
which
Mrs
Micawber
had
recently
vacated
,
and
stirred
the
fire
into
a
blaze
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
so
surprised
at
first
,
"
said
I
,
giving
him
welcome
with
all
the
cordiality
I
felt
,
"
that
I
had
hardly
breath
to
greet
you
with
,
Steerforth
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
the
sight
of
me
is
good
for
sore
eyes
,
as
the
Scotch
say
,
"
replied
Steerforth
,
"
and
so
is
the
sight
of
you
,
Daisy
,
in
full
bloom
.
 
<EOS>
How
are
you
,
my
Bacchanal
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
well
,
"
said
I
;
"
and
not
at
all
Bacchanalian
tonight
,
though
I
confess
to
another
party
of
three
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
of
whom
I
met
in
the
street
,
talking
loud
in
your
praise
,
"
returned
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
's
our
friend
in
the
tights
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
gave
him
the
best
idea
I
could
,
in
a
few
words
,
of
Mr
Micawber
.
<EOS>
He
laughed
heartily
at
my
feeble
portrait
of
that
gentleman
,
and
said
he
was
a
man
to
know
,
and
he
must
know
him
.
"
<EOS>
But
who
do
you
suppose
our
other
friend
is
?
"
said
I
,
in
my
turn
.
   
<EOS>
"
Heaven
knows
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bore
<EOS>
,
I
hope
?
 
<EOS>
I
thought
he
looked
a
little
like
one
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Traddles
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
replied
,
triumphantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
he
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Steerforth
,
in
his
careless
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
remember
Traddles
?
 
<EOS>
Traddles
in
our
room
at
Salem
House
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
That
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
said
Steerforth
,
beating
a
lump
of
coal
on
the
top
of
the
fire
,
with
the
poker
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
he
as
soft
as
ever
?
 
<EOS>
And
where
the
deuce
did
you
pick
him
up
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
extolled
Traddles
in
reply
,
as
highly
as
I
could
;
for
I
felt
that
Steerforth
rather
slighted
him
.
 
<EOS>
Steerforth
,
dismissing
the
subject
with
a
light
nod
,
and
a
smile
,
and
the
remark
that
he
would
be
glad
to
see
the
old
fellow
too
,
for
he
had
always
been
an
odd
fish
,
inquired
if
I
could
give
him
anything
to
eat
?
 
<EOS>
During
most
of
this
short
dialogue
,
when
he
had
not
been
speaking
in
a
wild
vivacious
manner
,
he
had
sat
idly
beating
on
the
lump
of
coal
with
the
poker
.
<EOS>
I
observed
that
he
did
the
same
thing
while
I
was
getting
out
the
remains
of
the
pigeon
-
pie
,
and
so
forth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Daisy
,
here
's
a
supper
for
a
king
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
starting
out
of
his
silence
with
a
burst
,
and
taking
his
seat
at
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
do
it
justice
,
for
I
have
come
from
Yarmouth
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
came
from
Oxford
?
"
I
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
I
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
seafaring
---
better
employed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Littimer
was
here
today
,
to
inquire
for
you
,
"
I
remarked
,
"
and
I
understood
him
that
you
were
at
Oxford
;
<EOS>
though
,
now
I
think
of
it
,
he
certainly
did
not
say
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Littimer
is
a
greater
fool
than
I
thought
him
,
to
have
been
inquiring
for
me
at
all
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
jovially
pouring
out
a
glass
of
wine
,
and
drinking
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
to
understanding
him
,
you
are
a
cleverer
fellow
than
most
of
us
,
Daisy
,
if
you
can
do
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
indeed
,
"
said
I
,
moving
my
chair
to
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
you
have
been
at
Yarmouth
,
Steerforth
!
"
<EOS>
interested
to
know
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
been
there
long
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
An
escapade
of
a
week
or
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
are
they
all
?
 
<EOS>
Of
course
,
little
Emily
is
not
married
yet
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Going
to
be
,
I
believe
---
in
so
many
weeks
,
or
months
,
or
something
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
much
of
'em
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
by
"
;
he
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
which
he
had
been
using
with
great
diligence
,
and
began
feeling
in
his
pockets
;
"
I
have
a
letter
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
From
whom
?
"
   
"
Why
,
from
your
old
nurse
,
"
he
returned
,
taking
some
papers
out
of
his
breast
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
"
J
Steerforth
,
Esquire
,
debtor
,
to
The
Willing
Mind
"
;
that
's
not
it
.
 
<EOS>
Patience
,
and
we
'll
find
it
presently
.
 
<EOS>
Old
what's
-
his
-
name
's
in
a
bad
way
,
and
it
's
about
that
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Barkis
,
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
"
still
feeling
in
his
pockets
,
and
looking
over
their
contents
:
"
it
's
all
over
with
poor
Barkis
,
I
am
afraid
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
a
little
apothecary
there
---
surgeon
,
or
whatever
he
is
---
who
brought
your
worship
into
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
mighty
learned
about
the
case
,
to
me
;
but
the
upshot
of
his
opinion
was
,
that
the
carrier
was
making
his
last
journey
rather
fast
.
 
<EOS>
---
Put
your
hand
into
the
breast
pocket
of
my
great
-
coat
on
the
chair
yonder
,
and
I
think
you
'll
find
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
it
is
!
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
from
Peggotty
;
something
less
legible
than
usual
,
and
brief
.
<EOS>
It
informed
me
of
her
husband
's
hopeless
state
,
and
hinted
at
his
being
"
a
little
nearer
"
than
heretofore
,
and
consequently
more
difficult
to
manage
for
his
own
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
It
said
nothing
of
her
weariness
and
watching
,
and
praised
him
highly
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
written
with
a
plain
,
unaffected
,
homely
piety
that
I
knew
to
be
genuine
,
and
ended
with
"
my
duty
to
my
ever
darling
"
---
meaning
myself
.
   
<EOS>
While
I
deciphered
it
,
Steerforth
continued
to
eat
and
drink
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
bad
job
,
"
he
said
,
when
I
had
done
;
"
but
<EOS>
the
sun
sets
every
day
,
and
people
die
every
minute
,
and
we
must
n't
be
scared
by
the
common
lot
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
failed
to
hold
our
own
,
because
that
equal
foot
at
all
men
's
doors
was
heard
knocking
somewhere
,
every
object
in
this
world
would
slip
from
us
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
Ride
on
!
 
<EOS>
Rough
-
shod
<EOS>
if
need
be
,
smooth
-
shod
if
that
will
do
,
but
ride
on
!
 
<EOS>
Ride
on
over
all
obstacles
,
and
win
the
race
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
win
what
race
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
The
race
that
one
has
started
in
,
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ride
on
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
noticed
,
I
remember
,
as
he
paused
,
looking
at
me
with
his
handsome
head
a
little
thrown
back
,
and
his
glass
raised
in
his
hand
,
that
,
though
the
freshness
of
the
sea
-
wind
was
on
his
face
,
and
it
was
ruddy
,
there
were
traces
in
it
,
made
since
I
last
saw
it
,
as
if
he
had
applied
himself
to
some
habitual
strain
of
the
fervent
energy
which
,
when
roused
,
was
so
passionately
roused
within
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
it
in
my
thoughts
to
remonstrate
with
him
upon
his
desperate
way
of
pursuing
any
fancy
that
he
took
---
such
as
this
buffeting
of
rough
seas
,
and
braving
of
hard
weather
,
for
example
---
when
my
mind
glanced
off
to
the
immediate
subject
of
our
conversation
again
,
and
pursued
that
instead
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
,
Steerforth
,
"
said
I
,
"
if
your
high
spirits
will
listen
to
me
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
are
potent
spirits
,
and
will
do
whatever
you
like
,
"
he
answered
,
moving
from
the
table
to
the
fireside
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
tell
you
what
,
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
will
go
down
and
see
my
old
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
that
I
can
do
her
any
good
,
or
render
her
any
real
service
;
but
she
is
so
attached
to
me
that
my
visit
will
have
as
much
effect
on
her
,
as
if
I
could
do
both
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
take
it
so
kindly
that
it
will
be
a
comfort
and
support
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
no
great
effort
to
make
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
for
such
a
friend
as
she
has
been
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Would
n't
you
go
a
day
's
journey
,
if
you
were
in
my
place
?
"
   
<EOS>
His
face
was
thoughtful
,
and
he
sat
considering
a
little
before
he
answered
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
Well
!
 
<EOS>
Go
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
do
no
harm
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
just
come
back
,
"
said
I
,
"
and
it
would
be
in
vain
to
ask
you
to
go
with
me
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
,
"
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
for
Highgate
tonight
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
my
mother
this
long
time
,
and
it
lies
upon
my
conscience
,
for
it
's
something
to
be
loved
as
she
loves
her
prodigal
son
.
 
<EOS>
---
Bah
!
<EOS>
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
---
You
mean
to
go
tomorrow
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
,
holding
me
out
at
arm
's
length
,
with
a
hand
on
each
of
my
shoulders
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
think
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
do
n't
go
till
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
wanted
you
to
come
and
stay
a
few
days
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
Here
I
am
,
on
purpose
to
bid
you
,
and
you
fly
off
to
Yarmouth
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
nice
fellow
to
talk
of
flying
off
,
Steerforth
,
who
are
always
running
wild
on
some
unknown
expedition
or
other
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
without
speaking
,
and
then
rejoined
,
still
holding
me
as
before
,
and
giving
me
a
shake
<EOS>
:
   
"
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Say
the
next
day
,
and
pass
as
much
of
tomorrow
as
you
can
with
us
!
<EOS>
Who
knows
when
we
may
meet
again
,
else
?
 
<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Say
the
next
day
!
 
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
stand
between
Rosa
Dartle
and
me
,
and
keep
us
asunder
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
love
each
other
too
much
,
without
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
or
hate
,
"
laughed
Steerforth
;
"
no
matter
which
.
 
<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Say
the
next
day
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
said
the
next
day
;
and
he
put
on
his
great
-
coat
and
lighted
his
cigar
,
and
set
off
to
walk
home
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
him
in
this
intention
,
I
put
on
my
own
great
-
coat
(
but
did
not
light
my
own
cigar
,
having
had
enough
of
that
for
one
while
)
and
walked
with
him
as
far
as
the
open
road
:
a
dull
road
,
then
,
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
great
spirits
all
the
way
;
and
when
we
parted
,
and
I
looked
after
him
going
so
gallantly
and
airily
homeward
<EOS>
,
I
thought
of
his
saying
,
"
Ride
on
over
all
obstacles
,
and
win
the
race
!
"
and
wished
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
he
had
some
worthy
race
to
run
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
undressing
in
my
own
room
,
when
Mr
Micawber
's
letter
tumbled
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
reminded
of
it
,
I
broke
the
seal
and
read
as
follows
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
dated
an
hour
and
a
half
before
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
whether
I
have
mentioned
that
,
when
Mr
Micawber
was
at
any
particularly
desperate
crisis
,
he
used
a
sort
of
legal
phraseology
,
which
he
seemed
to
think
equivalent
to
winding
up
his
affairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
SIR
---
for
I
dare
not
say
my
dear
Copperfield
,
"
   
"
It
is
expedient
that
I
should
inform
you
that
the

Crushed

<EOS>
Some
flickering
efforts
to
spare
you
the
premature
knowledge
of
his
calamitous
position
<EOS>
,
you
may
observe
in
him
this
day
;
but
hope
has
sunk
beneath
the
horizon
,
and
the
undersigned
is
Crushed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
present
communication
is
penned
within
the
personal
range
(
I
can
not
call
it
the
society
)
of
an
individual
,
in
a
state
closely
bordering
on
intoxication
,
employed
by
a
broker
.
 
<EOS>
That
individual
is
in
legal
possession
of
the
premises
,
under
a
distress
for
rent
.
<EOS>
His
inventory
includes
,
not
only
the
chattels
and
effects
of
every
description
belonging
to
the

,
as
yearly
tenant
of
this
habitation
,
but
also
those
appertaining
to
Mr
Thomas
Traddles
,
lodger
,
a
member
of
the
Honourable
Society
of
the
Inner
Temple
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
any
drop
of
gloom
were
wanting
in
the
overflowing
cup
,
which
is
now
"
commended
"
(
in
the
language
of
an
immortal
Writer
)
to
the
lips
of
the

,
it
would
be
found
in
the
fact
,
that
a
friendly
acceptance
granted
to
the

,
by
the

-
mentioned
Mr

Traddles
,
for
the
sum

,
in

After
premising
thus
much
,
it
would
be
a
work
of
supererogation
to
add

<EOS>
Poor
Traddles
!
 
<EOS>
I
knew
enough
of
Mr
Micawber
by
this
time
,
to
foresee
that
he
might
be
expected
to
recover
the
blow
;
but
my
night
's
rest
was
sorely
distressed
by
thoughts
of
Traddles
,
and
of
the
curate
's
daughter
,
who
was
one
of
ten
,
down
in
Devonshire
,
and
who
was
such
a
dear
girl
,
and
who
would
wait
for
Traddles
(
ominous
praise
!
)
<EOS>
until
she
was
sixty
,
or
any
age
that
could
be
mentioned
.
      
<EOS>
Chapter
29
.
<EOS>
I
visit
Steerforth
at
his
home
,
again
 
I
mentioned
to
Mr
Spenlow
in
the
morning
,
that
I
wanted
leave
of
absence
for
a
short
time
;
and
as
I
was
not
in
the
receipt
of
any
salary
,
and
consequently
was
not
obnoxious
to
the
implacable
Jorkins
,
there
was
no
difficulty
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
that
opportunity
,
with
my
voice
sticking
in
my
throat
,
and
my
sight
failing
as
I
uttered
the
words
,
to
express
my
hope
that
Miss
Spenlow
was
quite
well
;
to
which
Mr
Spenlow
replied
,
with
no
more
emotion
than
if
he
had
been
speaking
of
an
ordinary
human
being
,
that
he
was
much
obliged
to
me
,
and
she
was
very
well
.
   
<EOS>
We
articled
clerks
,
as
germs
of
the
patrician
order
of
proctors
,
were
treated
with
so
much
consideration
,
that
I
was
almost
my
own
master
at
all
times
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
did
not
care
,
however
,
to
get
to
Highgate
before
one
or
two
o'clock
in
the
day
,
and
as
we
had
another
little
excommunication
case
in
court
that
morning
,
which
was
called
The
office
of
the
judge
promoted
by
Tipkins
against
Bullock
for
his
soul
's
correction
,
I
passed
an
hour
or
two
in
attendance
on
it
with
Mr
Spenlow
very
agreeably
.
 
<EOS>
It
arose
out
of
a
scuffle
between
two
churchwardens
,
one
of
whom
was
alleged
to
have
pushed
the
other
against
a
pump
;
the
handle
of
which
pump
projecting
into
a
school
-
house
,
which
school
-
house
was
under
a
gable
of
the
church
-
roof
,
made
the
push
an
ecclesiastical
offence
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
amusing
case
;
and
sent
me
up
to
Highgate
,
on
the
box
of
the
stage
-
coach
,
thinking
about
the
Commons
,
and
what
Mr
Spenlow
had
said
about
touching
the
Commons
and
bringing
down
the
country
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Steerforth
was
pleased
to
see
me
,
and
so
was
Rosa
Dartle
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
agreeably
surprised
to
find
that
Littimer
was
not
there
,
and
that
we
were
attended
by
a
modest
little
parlour
-
maid
,
with
blue
ribbons
in
her
cap
,
whose
eye
it
was
much
more
pleasant
,
and
much
less
disconcerting
,
to
catch
by
accident
,
than
the
eye
of
that
respectable
man
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
I
particularly
observed
,
before
I
had
been
half
-
an
-
hour
in
the
house
,
was
the
close
and
attentive
watch
Miss
Dartle
kept
upon
me
;
and
the
lurking
manner
in
which
she
seemed
to
compare
my
face
with
Steerforth
's
,
and
Steerforth
's
with
mine
,
and
to
lie
in
wait
for
something
to
come
out
between
the
two
.
<EOS>
So
surely
as
I
looked
towards
her
,
did
I
see
that
eager
visage
,
with
its
gaunt
black
eyes
and
searching
brow
,
intent
on
mine
;
or
passing
suddenly
from
mine
to
Steerforth
's
;
or
comprehending
both
of
us
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
lynx
-
like
scrutiny
she
was
so
far
from
faltering
when
she
saw
I
observed
it
,
that
at
such
a
time
she
only
fixed
her
piercing
look
upon
me
with
a
more
intent
expression
still
.
 
<EOS>
Blameless
as
I
was
,
and
knew
that
I
was
,
in
reference
to
any
wrong
she
could
possibly
suspect
me
of
<EOS>
,
I
shrunk
before
her
strange
eyes
,
quite
unable
to
endure
their
hungry
lustre
.
   
<EOS>
All
day
,
she
seemed
to
pervade
the
whole
house
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
talked
to
Steerforth
in
his
room
,
I
heard
her
dress
rustle
in
the
little
gallery
outside
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
and
I
engaged
in
some
of
our
old
exercises
on
the
lawn
behind
the
house
,
I
saw
her
face
pass
from
window
to
window
,
like
a
wandering
light
,
until
it
fixed
itself
in
one
,
and
watched
us
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
all
four
went
out
walking
in
the
afternoon
,
she
closed
her
thin
hand
on
my
arm
like
a
spring
,
to
keep
me
back
,
while
Steerforth
and
his
mother
went
on
out
of
hearing
:
and
then
spoke
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
a
long
time
,
"
she
said
,
"
without
coming
here
.
 
<EOS>
Is
your
profession
really
so
engaging
and
interesting
as
to
absorb
your
whole
attention
?
 
<EOS>
I
ask
because
I
always
want
to
be
informed
,
when
I
am
ignorant
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
really
,
though
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
replied
that
I
liked
it
well
enough
,
but
that
I
certainly
could
not
claim
so
much
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
know
that
,
because
I
always
like
to
be
put
right
when
I
am
wrong
,
"
said
Rosa
Dartle
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
mean
it
is
a
little
dry
,
perhaps
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
I
replied
;
"
perhaps
it
was
a
little
dry
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
and
that
's
a
reason
why
you
want
relief
and
change
---
excitement
and
all
that
?
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
very
true
!
 
<EOS>
But
is
n't
it
a
little
---
Eh
?
---
for
him
;
I
do
n't
mean
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
A
quick
glance
of
her
eye
towards
the
spot
where
Steerforth
was
walking
,
with
his
mother
leaning
on
his
arm
,
showed
me
whom
she
meant
;
but
beyond
that
,
I
was
quite
lost
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
looked
so
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
it
---
I
do
n't
say
that
it
does
,
mind
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
---
do
n't
it
rather
engross
him
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
it
make
him
,
perhaps
,
a
little
more
remiss
than
usual
in
his
visits
to
his
blindly
-
doting
---
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
another
quick
glance
at
them
,
and
such
a
glance
at
me
as
seemed
to
look
into
my
innermost
thoughts
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dartle
,
"
I
returned
,
"
pray
do
not
think
---
"
   
"
I
do
n't
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
me
,
do
n't
suppose
that
I
think
anything
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
suspicious
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
ask
a
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
state
any
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
found
an
opinion
on
what
you
tell
me
.
<EOS>
Then
,
it
's
not
so
?
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
am
very
glad
to
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
certainly
is
not
the
fact
,
"
said
I
,
perplexed
,
"
that
I
am
accountable
for
Steerforth
's
having
been
away
from
home
longer
than
usual
---
if
he
has
been
:
which
I
really
do
n't
know
at
this
moment
,
unless
I
understand
it
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
him
this
long
while
,
until
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
Miss
Dartle
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
she
looked
full
at
me
,
I
saw
her
face
grow
sharper
and
paler
,
and
the
marks
of
the
old
wound
lengthen
out
until
it
cut
through
the
disfigured
lip
,
and
deep
into
the
nether
lip
,
and
slanted
down
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
something
positively
awful
to
me
in
this
,
and
in
the
brightness
of
her
eyes
,
as
she
said
,
looking
fixedly
at
me
:
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
he
doing
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
repeated
the
words
,
more
to
myself
than
her
,
being
so
amazed
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
he
doing
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
with
an
eagerness
that
seemed
enough
to
consume
her
like
a
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
what
is
that
man
assisting
him
,
who
never
looks
at
me
without
an
inscrutable
falsehood
in
his
eyes
?
<EOS>
If
you
are
honourable
and
faithful
,
I
do
n't
ask
you
to
betray
your
friend
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
you
only
to
tell
me
,
is
it
anger
,
is
it
hatred
,
is
it
pride
,
is
it
restlessness
,
is
it
some
wild
fancy
,
is
it
love
,
<EOS>
what
is
it
,
that
is
leading
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dartle
,
"
<EOS>
I
returned
,
"
how
shall
I
tell
you
,
so
that
you
will
believe
me
,
that
I
know
of
nothing
in
Steerforth
different
from
what
there
was
when
I
first
came
here
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
think
of
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
firmly
believe
there
is
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
understand
even
what
you
mean
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
she
still
stood
looking
fixedly
at
me
,
a
twitching
or
throbbing
,
from
which
I
could
not
dissociate
the
idea
of
pain
,
came
into
that
cruel
mark
;
and
lifted
up
the
corner
of
her
lip
as
if
with
scorn
,
or
with
a
pity
that
despised
its
object
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
her
hand
upon
it
hurriedly
---
a
hand
so
thin
and
delicate
,
that
when
I
had
seen
her
hold
it
up
before
the
fire
to
shade
her
face
,
I
had
compared
it
in
my
thoughts
to
fine
porcelain
---
and
saying
,
in
a
quick
,
fierce
,
passionate
way
,
"
I
swear
you
to
secrecy
about
this
!
"
<EOS>
said
not
a
word
more
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Steerforth
was
particularly
happy
in
her
son
's
society
,
and
Steerforth
was
,
on
this
occasion
,
particularly
attentive
and
respectful
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
interesting
to
me
to
see
them
together
,
not
only
on
account
of
their
mutual
affection
,
but
because
of
the
strong
personal
resemblance
between
them
,
and
the
manner
in
which
what
was
haughty
or
impetuous
in
him
was
softened
by
age
and
sex
,
in
her
,
to
a
gracious
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
,
more
than
once
,
that
it
was
well
no
serious
cause
of
division
<EOS>
had
ever
come
between
them
;
or
two
such
natures
---
I
ought
rather
to
express
it
,
two
such
shades
of
the
same
nature
---
might
have
been
harder
to
reconcile
than
the
two
extremest
opposites
in
creation
.
 
<EOS>
The
idea
did
not
originate
in
my
own
discernment
,
I
am
bound
to
confess
,
but
in
a
speech
of
Rosa
Dartle
's
.
   
<EOS>
She
said
at
dinner
:
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
do
tell
me
,
though
,
somebody
,
because
I
have
been
thinking
about
it
all
day
,
and
I
want
to
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
know
what
,
Rosa
?
"
returned
Mrs
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
pray
,
Rosa
,
do
not
be
mysterious
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mysterious
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
really
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
consider
me
so
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
I
constantly
entreat
you
,
"
said
Mrs
Steerforth
,
"
to
speak
plainly
,
in
your
own
natural
manner
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
then
this
is
not
my
natural
manner
?
<EOS>
"
she
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
you
must
really
bear
with
me
,
because
I
ask
for
information
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
know
ourselves
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
has
become
a
second
nature
,
"
said
Mrs
Steerforth
,
without
any
displeasure
;
"
but
I
remember
,
---
<EOS>
and
so
must
you
,
I
think
,
---
when
your
manner
was
different
,
Rosa
;
when
it
was
not
so
guarded
,
and
was
more
trustful
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
are
right
,
"
she
returned
;
"
and
so
it
is
that
bad
habits
grow
upon
one
!
 
<EOS>
Really
?
 
<EOS>
Less
guarded
and
more
trustful
?
<EOS>
How
can
I
,
imperceptibly
,
have
changed
,
I
wonder
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
that
's
very
odd
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
study
to
regain
my
former
self
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
,
"
said
Mrs
Steerforth
,
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
really
will
,
you
know
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
learn
frankness
from
---
<EOS>
let
me
see
---
from
James
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
learn
frankness
,
Rosa
,
"
said
Mrs
Steerforth
quickly
---
<EOS>
for
there
was
always
some
effect
of
sarcasm
in
what
Rosa
Dartle
said
,
though
it
was
said
,
as
this
was
,
in
the
most
unconscious
manner
in
the
world
---
"
in
a
better
school
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
I
am
sure
of
,
"
she
answered
,
with
uncommon
fervour
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
am
sure
of
anything
,
of
course
,
you
know
,
I
am
sure
of
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Steerforth
appeared
to
me
to
regret
having
been
a
little
nettled
;
for
she
presently
said
,
in
a
kind
tone
:
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
my
dear
Rosa
,
we
have
not
heard
what
it
is
that
you
want
to
be
satisfied
about
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
I
want
to
be
satisfied
about
?
"
<EOS>
she
replied
,
with
provoking
coldness
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
only
whether
people
,
who
are
like
each
other
in
their
moral
constitution
---
is
that
the
phrase
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
as
good
a
phrase
as
another
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
:
---
whether
people
,
who
are
like
each
other
in
their
moral
constitution
,
are
in
greater
danger
than
people
not
so
circumstanced
,
supposing
any
serious
cause
of
variance
to
arise
between
them
,
of
being
divided
angrily
and
deeply
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
yes
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Should
you
?
"
she
retorted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
Supposing
then
,
for
instance
---
any
unlikely
thing
will
do
for
a
supposition
---
that
you
and
your
mother
were
to
have
a
serious
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Rosa
,
"
interposed
Mrs
Steerforth
,
laughing
good
-
naturedly
,
"
suggest
some
other
supposition
!
 
<EOS>
James
and
<EOS>
I
know
our
duty
to
each
other
better
,
I
pray
Heaven
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Miss
Dartle
,
nodding
her
head
thoughtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
That
would
prevent
it
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
of
course
it
would
.
 
<EOS>
Exactly
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
am
glad
I
have
been
so
foolish
as
to
put
the
case
,
for
it
is
so
very
good
to
know
that
your
duty
to
each
other
would
prevent
it
!
<EOS>
Thank
you
very
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
One
other
little
circumstance
connected
with
Miss
Dartle
<EOS>
I
must
not
omit
;
for
I
had
reason
to
remember
it
thereafter
,
when
all
the
irremediable
past
was
rendered
plain
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
whole
of
this
day
,
but
especially
from
this
period
of
it
,
Steerforth
exerted
himself
with
his
utmost
skill
,
and
that
was
with
his
utmost
ease
,
to
charm
this
singular
creature
into
a
pleasant
and
pleased
companion
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
should
succeed
,
was
no
matter
of
surprise
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
That
she
should
struggle
against
the
fascinating
influence
of
his
delightful
art
---
<EOS>
delightful
nature
<EOS>
I
thought
it
then
---
did
not
surprise
me
either
;
for
I
knew
that
she
was
sometimes
jaundiced
and
perverse
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
her
features
and
her
manner
slowly
change
;
I
saw
her
look
at
him
with
growing
admiration
;
I
saw
her
try
,
more
and
more
faintly
,
but
always
angrily
,
as
if
she
condemned
a
weakness
in
herself
,
to
resist
the
captivating
power
that
he
possessed
;
and
finally
,
I
saw
her
sharp
glance
soften
,
and
her
smile
become
quite
gentle
,
and
I
ceased
to
be
afraid
of
her
as
I
had
really
been
all
day
,
and
we
all
sat
about
the
fire
,
talking
and
laughing
together
,
with
as
little
reserve
as
if
we
had
been
children
.
   
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
because
we
had
sat
there
so
long
,
or
because
Steerforth
was
resolved
not
to
lose
the
advantage
he
had
gained
,
I
do
not
know
;
but
we
did
not
remain
in
the
dining
-
room
more
than
five
minutes
after
her
departure
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
playing
her
harp
,
"
said
Steerforth
,
softly
,
at
the
drawing
-
room
door
,
"
and
nobody
but
my
mother
has
heard
her
do
that
,
I
believe
,
these
three
years
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
said
it
with
a
curious
smile
,
which
was
gone
directly
;
and
we
went
into
the
room
and
found
her
alone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
get
up
,
"
said
Steerforth
(
which
she
had
already
done
)
"
<EOS>
my
dear
Rosa
,
do
n't
!
 
<EOS>
Be
kind
for
once
,
and
sing
us
an
Irish
song
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
care
for
an
Irish
song
?
<EOS>
"
she
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Much
!
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Much
more
than
for
any
other
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
Daisy
,
too
,
loves
music
from
his
soul
.
 
<EOS>
Sing
us
an
Irish
song
,
Rosa
!
<EOS>
and
let
me
sit
and
listen
as
I
used
to
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
did
not
touch
her
,
or
the
chair
from
which
she
had
risen
,
but
sat
himself
near
the
harp
.
 
<EOS>
She
stood
beside
it
for
some
little
while
,
in
a
curious
way
,
going
through
the
motion
of
playing
it
with
her
right
hand
,
but
not
sounding
it
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
she
sat
down
,
and
drew
it
to
her
with
one
sudden
action
,
and
played
and
sang
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
it
was
,
in
her
touch
or
voice
,
that
made
that
song
the
most
unearthly
<EOS>
I
have
ever
heard
in
my
life
,
or
can
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
something
fearful
in
the
reality
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
it
had
never
been
written
,
or
set
to
music
,
but
sprung
out
of
passion
within
her
;
which
found
imperfect
utterance
in
the
low
sounds
of
her
voice
,
and
crouched
again
when
all
was
still
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
dumb
when
she
leaned
beside
the
harp
again
,
playing
it
,
but
not
sounding
it
,
with
her
right
hand
.
   
<EOS>
A
minute
more
,
and
this
had
roused
me
from
my
trance
:
---
Steerforth
had
left
his
seat
,
and
gone
to
her
,
and
had
put
his
arm
laughingly
about
her
,
and
had
said
,
"
Come
,
Rosa
,
for
the
future
we
will
love
each
other
very
much
!
"
<EOS>
And
she
had
struck
him
,
and
had
thrown
him
off
with
the
fury
of
a
wild
cat
,
and
had
burst
out
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
with
Rosa
?
"
said
Mrs
Steerforth
,
coming
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
has
been
an
angel
,
mother
,
"
returned
Steerforth
,
"
for
a
little
while
;
and
has
run
into
the
opposite
extreme
,
since
,
by
way
of
compensation
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
should
be
careful
not
to
irritate
her
,
James
.
 
<EOS>
Her
temper
has
been
soured
,
remember
,
and
ought
not
to
be
tried
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
did
not
come
back
;
and
no
other
mention
was
made
of
her
,
until
I
went
with
Steerforth
into
his
room
to
say
Good
night
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
laughed
about
her
,
and
asked
me
if
I
had
ever
seen
such
a
fierce
little
piece
of
incomprehensibility
.
   
<EOS>
I
expressed
as
much
of
my
astonishment
as
was
then
capable
of
expression
,
and
asked
if
he
could
guess
what
it
was
that
she
had
taken
so
much
amiss
,
so
suddenly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Heaven
knows
,
"
said
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Anything
you
like
---
or
nothing
!
 
<EOS>
I
told
you
she
took
everything
,
herself
included
,
to
a
grindstone
,
and
sharpened
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
an
edge
-
tool
,
and
requires
great
care
in
dealing
with
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
always
dangerous
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
"
my
dear
Steerforth
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
gone
before
you
wake
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
unwilling
to
let
me
go
;
and
stood
,
holding
me
out
,
with
a
hand
on
each
of
my
shoulders
,
as
he
had
done
in
my
own
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Daisy
,
"
he
said
,
with
a
smile
---
"
<EOS>
for
though
that
's
not
the
name
your
godfathers
and
godmothers
gave
you
,
it
's
the
name
I
like
best
to
call
you
by
---
and
I
wish
,
I
wish
,
I
wish
,
you
could
give
it
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
so
I
can
,
if
I
choose
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Daisy
,
if
anything
should
ever
separate
us
,
you
must
think
of
me
at
my
best
,
old
boy
.
 
<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Let
us
make
that
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
Think
of
me
at
my
best
,
if
circumstances
should
ever
part
us
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
best
to
me
,
Steerforth
,
"
said
I
,
"
and
no
worst
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
always
equally
loved
,
and
cherished
in
my
heart
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
much
compunction
for
having
ever
wronged
him
,
even
by
a
shapeless
thought
<EOS>
,
did
I
feel
within
me
,
that
the
confession
of
having
done
so
was
rising
to
my
lips
.
 
<EOS>
But
for
the
reluctance
I
had
to
betray
the
confidence
of
Agnes
,
but
for
my
uncertainty
how
to
approach
the
subject
with
no
risk
of
doing
so
,
it
would
have
reached
them
before
he
said
,
"
God
bless
you
,
Daisy
,
and
good
night
!
<EOS>
"
In
my
doubt
,
it
did
NOT
reach
them
;
and
we
shook
hands
,
and
we
parted
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
up
with
the
dull
dawn
,
and
,
having
dressed
as
quietly
as
I
could
,
looked
into
his
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
fast
asleep
;
lying
,
easily
,
with
his
head
upon
his
arm
,
as
I
had
often
seen
him
lie
at
school
.
   
<EOS>
The
time
came
in
its
season
,
and
that
was
very
soon
,
when
I
almost
wondered
that
nothing
troubled
his
repose
,
as
I
looked
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
slept
---
<EOS>
let
me
think
of
him
so
again
---
as
I
had
often
seen
him
sleep
at
school
;
and
thus
,
in
this
silent
hour
,
I
left
him
.
   
<EOS>
---
Never
more
,
oh
God
forgive
you
,
Steerforth
!
<EOS>
to
touch
that
passive
hand
in
love
and
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
Never
,
never
more
!

Chapter
30
.
<EOS>
A
loss
 
I
got
down
to
Yarmouth
in
the
evening
,
and
went
to
the
inn
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
that
Peggotty
's
spare
room
---
my
room
---
was
likely
to
have
occupation
enough
in
a
little
while
,
<EOS>
if
that
great
Visitor
,
before
whose
presence
all
the
living
must
give
place
,
were
not
already
in
the
house
;
so
I
betook
myself
to
the
inn
,
and
dined
there
,
and
engaged
my
bed
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
ten
o'clock
when
I
went
out
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
the
shops
were
shut
,
and
the
town
was
dull
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
came
to
Omer
and
Joram
's
,
I
found
the
shutters
up
,
but
the
shop
door
standing
open
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
could
obtain
a
perspective
view
of
Mr
Omer
inside
,
smoking
his
pipe
by
the
parlour
door
,
I
entered
,
and
asked
him
how
he
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
bless
my
life
and
soul
!
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
"
how
do
you
find
yourself
?
 
<EOS>
Take
a
seat
.
 
<EOS>
---
Smoke
not
disagreeable
,
I
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
no
means
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
like
it
---
in
somebody
else
's
pipe
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
not
in
your
own
,
eh
?
"
Mr
Omer
returned
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
the
better
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Bad
habit
for
a
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
Take
a
seat
.
 
<EOS>
I
smoke
,
myself
,
for
the
asthma
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Omer
had
made
room
for
me
,
and
placed
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
sat
down
again
very
much
out
of
breath
,
gasping
at
his
pipe
as
if
it
contained
a
supply
of
that
necessary
,
without
which
he
must
perish
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
have
heard
bad
news
of
Mr
Barkis
,
"
said
I.
   
Mr
Omer
looked
at
me
,
with
a
steady
countenance
,
and
shook
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
how
he
is
tonight
?
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
very
question
I
should
have
put
to
you
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Omer
,
"
but
on
account
of
delicacy
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
one
of
the
drawbacks
of
our
line
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
When
a
party
's
ill
,
we
ca
n't
ask
how
the
party
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
difficulty
had
not
occurred
to
me
;
though
I
had
had
my
apprehensions
too
,
when
I
went
in
,
of
hearing
the
old
tune
.
 
<EOS>
On
its
being
mentioned
,
I
recognized
it
,
however
,
and
said
as
much
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
you
understand
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
nodding
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
dursn't
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
you
,
it
would
be
a
shock
that
the
generality
of
parties
might
n't
recover
,
to
say
"
Omer
and
Joram
's
compliments
,
and
how
do
you
find
yourself
this
morning
?
"
<EOS>
---
or
this
afternoon
---
as
it
may
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Omer
and
I
nodded
at
each
other
,
and
Mr
Omer
recruited
his
wind
by
the
aid
of
his
pipe
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
one
of
the
things
that
cut
the
trade
off
from
attentions
they
could
often
wish
to
show
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
myself
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
have
known
Barkis
a
year
,
to
move
to
as
he
went
by
,
I
have
known
him
forty
years
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
go
and
say
,
"
how
is
he
?
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
felt
it
was
rather
hard
on
Mr
Omer
,
and
I
told
him
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
more
self
-
interested
,
I
hope
,
than
another
man
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
at
me
!
 
<EOS>
My
wind
may
fail
me
at
any
moment
,
and
it
ai
n't
likely
that
,
to
my
own
knowledge
,
I
'd
be
self
-
interested
under
such
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
it
ai
n't
likely
,
in
a
man
who
knows
his
wind
will
go
,
when
it
DOES
go
,
as
if
a
pair
of
bellows
was
cut
open
;
and
that
man
a
grandfather
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
   
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
Not
at
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
that
I
complain
of
my
line
of
business
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
that
.
 
<EOS>
Some
good
and
some
bad
goes
,
no
doubt
,
to
all
callings
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
wish
is
,
that
parties
was
brought
up
stronger
-
minded
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Omer
,
with
a
very
complacent
and
amiable
face
,
took
several
puffs
in
silence
;
and
then
said
,
resuming
his
first
point
:
   
"
<EOS>
Accordingly
we
're
obleeged
,
in
ascertaining
how
Barkis
goes
on
,
to
limit
ourselves
to
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
She
knows
what
our
real
objects
are
,
and
she
do
n't
have
any
more
alarms
or
suspicions
about
us
,
than
if
we
was
so
many
lambs
.
 
<EOS>
Minnie
and
Joram
have
just
stepped
down
to
the
house
,
in
fact
(
she
's
there
,
after
hours
,
helping
her
aunt
a
bit
)
,
to
ask
her
how
he
is
tonight
;
and
if
you
was
to
please
to
wait
till
they
come
back
,
they
'd
give
you
full
partic'lers
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
take
something
?
 
<EOS>
A
glass
of
srub
and
water
,
now
?
 
<EOS>
I
smoke
on
srub
and
water
,
myself
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
taking
up
his
glass
,
"
because
it
's
considered
softening
to
the
passages
,
by
which
this
troublesome
breath
of
mine
gets
into
action
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Lord
bless
you
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
huskily
,
"
it
ai
n't
the
passages
that
's
out
of
order
!
 
<EOS>
"
Give
me
breath
enough
,
"
said
I
to
my
daughter
Minnie
,
"
and
I
'll
find
passages
,
my
dear
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
really
had
no
breath
to
spare
,
and
it
was
very
alarming
to
see
him
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
again
in
a
condition
to
be
talked
to
,
I
thanked
him
for
the
proffered
refreshment
,
which
I
declined
,
as
I
had
just
had
dinner
;
and
,
observing
that
I
would
wait
,
since
he
was
so
good
as
to
invite
me
,
until
his
daughter
and
his
son
-
in
-
law
came
back
,
I
inquired
how
little
Emily
was
?
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
removing
his
pipe
,
that
he
might
rub
his
chin
:
"
<EOS>
I
tell
you
truly
,
I
shall
be
glad
when
her
marriage
has
taken
place
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
so
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
she
's
unsettled
at
present
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
that
she
's
not
as
pretty
as
ever
,
for
she
's
prettier
<EOS>
---
I
do
assure
you
,
she
is
prettier
.
 
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
that
she
do
n't
work
as
well
as
ever
,
for
she
does
.
 
<EOS>
She
WAS
worth
any
six
,
and
she
IS
worth
any
six
.
 
<EOS>
But
somehow
she
wants
heart
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
understand
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
after
rubbing
his
chin
again
,
and
smoking
a
little
,
"
what
I
mean
in
a
general
way
by
the
expression
,
"
A
long
pull
,
and
a
strong
pull
,
and
a
pull
altogether
,
my
hearties
,
hurrah
!
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
to
you
,
that
that
was
---
in
a
general
way
---
what
I
miss
in
Em'ly
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Omer
's
face
and
manner
went
for
so
much
,
that
I
could
conscientiously
nod
my
head
,
as
divining
his
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
My
quickness
of
apprehension
seemed
to
please
him
,
and
he
went
on
:
"
Now
I
consider
this
is
principally
on
account
of
her
being
in
an
unsettled
state
,
you
see
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
talked
it
over
a
good
deal
,
her
uncle
and
myself
,
and
her
sweetheart
and
myself
,
after
business
;
and
I
consider
it
is
principally
on
account
of
her
being
unsettled
.
<EOS>
You
must
always
recollect
of
Em'ly
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
shaking
his
head
gently
,
"
that
she
's
a
most
extraordinary
affectionate
little
thing
.
 
<EOS>
The
proverb
says
,
"
You
ca
n't
make
a
silk
purse
out
of
a
sow
's
ear
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
about
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
rather
think
you
may
,
if
you
begin
early
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
made
a
home
out
of
that
old
boat
,
sir
,
that
stone
and
marble
could
n't
beat
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
she
has
!
"
said
I.
   
"
<EOS>
To
see
the
clinging
of
that
pretty
little
thing
to
her
uncle
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
;
"
to
see
the
way
she
holds
on
to
him
,
tighter
and
tighter
,
and
closer
and
closer
,
every
day
,
is
to
see
a
sight
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
you
know
,
there
's
a
struggle
going
on
when
that
's
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
it
be
made
a
longer
one
than
is
needful
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
listened
attentively
to
the
good
old
fellow
,
and
acquiesced
,
with
all
my
heart
,
in
what
he
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
Therefore
,
I
mentioned
to
them
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
in
a
comfortable
,
easy
-
going
tone
,
"
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
Now
,
do
n't
consider
Em'ly
nailed
down
in
point
of
time
,
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Make
it
your
own
time
.
 
<EOS>
Her
services
have
been
more
valuable
than
was
supposed
;
her
learning
has
been
quicker
than
was
supposed
;
Omer
and
Joram
can
run
their
pen
through
what
remains
;
and
she
's
free
when
you
wish
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
likes
to
make
any
little
arrangement
,
afterwards
,
in
the
way
of
doing
any
little
thing
for
us
at
home
,
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
do
n't
,
very
well
still
.
 
<EOS>
We
're
no
losers
,
anyhow
.
<EOS>
"
For
---
do
n't
you
see
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
touching
me
with
his
pipe
,
"
it
ai
n't
likely
that
a
man
so
short
of
breath
as
myself
,
and
a
grandfather
too
,
would
go
and
strain
points
with
a
little
bit
of
a
blue
-
eyed
blossom
,
like
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
I
am
certain
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
right
!
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
her
cousin
---
you
know
it
's
a
cousin
<EOS>
she
's
going
to
be
married
to
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
"
I
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
him
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
do
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
Her
cousin
being
,
as
it
appears
,
in
good
work
,
and
well
to
do
,
thanked
me
in
a
very
manly
sort
of
manner
for
this
(
conducting
himself
altogether
,
I
must
say
,
in
a
way
that
gives
me
a
high
opinion
of
him
)
,
and
went
and
took
as
comfortable
a
little
house
as
you
or
I
could
wish
to
clap
eyes
on
.
 
<EOS>
That
little
house
is
now
furnished
right
through
,
as
neat
and
complete
as
a
doll
's
parlour
;
and
but
for
Barkis
's
illness
having
taken
this
bad
turn
,
poor
fellow
,
they
would
have
been
man
and
wife
---
I
dare
say
,
by
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
there
's
a
postponement
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
Emily
,
Mr
Omer
?
"
I
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
Has
she
become
more
settled
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
that
,
you
know
,
"
he
returned
,
rubbing
his
double
chin
again
,
"
ca
n't
naturally
be
expected
.
 
<EOS>
The
prospect
of
the
change
and
separation
,
and
all
that
,
is
,
as
one
may
say
,
close
to
her
and
far
away
from
her
,
both
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
Barkis
's
death
need
n't
put
it
off
much
,
but
his
lingering
might
.
 
<EOS>
Anyway
,
it
's
an
uncertain
state
of
matters
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Consequently
,
"
pursued
Mr
Omer
,
"
Em'ly
's
still
a
little
down
,
and
a
little
fluttered
;
perhaps
,
upon
the
whole
,
she
's
more
so
than
she
was
.
 
<EOS>
Every
day
she
seems
to
get
fonder
and
fonder
of
her
uncle
,
and
more
loth
to
part
from
all
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
A
kind
word
from
me
brings
the
tears
into
her
eyes
;
and
if
you
was
to
see
her
with
my
daughter
Minnie
's
little
girl
,
you
'd
never
forget
it
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
my
heart
alive
!
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
pondering
,
"
how
she
loves
that
child
!
"
   
<EOS>
Having
so
favourable
an
opportunity
,
it
occurred
to
me
to
ask
Mr
Omer
,
before
our
conversation
should
be
interrupted
by
the
return
of
his
daughter
and
her
husband
,
whether
he
knew
anything
of
Martha
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
rejoined
,
shaking
his
head
,
and
looking
very
much
dejected
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
good
.
 
<EOS>
A
sad
story
,
sir
,
however
you
come
to
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
thought
there
was
harm
in
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
wish
to
mention
it
before
my
daughter
Minnie
<EOS>
---
for
she
'd
take
me
up
directly
---
but
I
never
did
.
 
<EOS>
None
of
us
ever
did
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Omer
,
hearing
his
daughter
's
footstep
before
I
heard
it
,
touched
me
with
his
pipe
,
and
shut
up
one
eye
,
as
a
caution
.
 
<EOS>
She
and
her
husband
came
in
immediately
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
Their
report
was
,
that
Mr
Barkis
was
"
as
bad
as
bad
could
be
"
;
that
he
was
quite
unconscious
;
and
that
Mr
Chillip
had
mournfully
said
in
the
kitchen
,
on
going
away
just
now
,
that
the
College
of
Physicians
,
the
College
of
Surgeons
,
and
Apothecaries
'
Hall
,
if
they
were
all
called
in
together
,
could
n't
help
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
past
both
Colleges
,
Mr
Chillip
said
,
and
the
Hall
could
only
poison
him
.
   
<EOS>
Hearing
this
,
and
learning
that
Mr
Peggotty
was
there
,
I
determined
to
go
to
the
house
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
I
bade
good
night
to
Mr
Omer
,
and
to
Mr
and
Mrs
Joram
;
and
directed
my
steps
thither
,
with
a
solemn
feeling
,
which
made
Mr
Barkis
quite
a
new
and
different
creature
.
   
<EOS>
My
low
tap
at
the
door
was
answered
by
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
so
much
surprised
to
see
me
as
I
had
expected
.
 
<EOS>
I
remarked
this
in
Peggotty
,
too
,
when
she
came
down
;
and
I
have
seen
it
since
;
and
I
think
,
in
the
expectation
of
that
dread
surprise
,
all
other
changes
and
surprises
dwindle
into
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
I
shook
hands
with
Mr
Peggotty
,
and
passed
into
the
kitchen
,
while
he
softly
closed
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Emily
was
sitting
by
the
fire
,
with
her
hands
before
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
Ham
was
standing
near
her
.
   
<EOS>
We
spoke
in
whispers
;
listening
,
between
whiles
,
for
any
sound
in
the
room
above
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
not
thought
of
it
on
the
occasion
of
my
last
visit
,
but
how
strange
it
was
to
me
,
now
,
to
miss
Mr
Barkis
out
of
the
kitchen
!
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
very
kind
of
you
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
oncommon
kind
,
"
said
Ham
.
   
<EOS>
"
Em'ly
,
my
dear
,
"
cried
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
See
here
!
 
<EOS>
Here
's
<EOS>
Mas'r
Davy
come
!
 
<EOS>
What
,
cheer
up
,
pretty
!
 
<EOS>
Not
a
wured
to
Mas'r
Davy
?
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
trembling
upon
her
,
that
I
can
see
now
.
 
<EOS>
The
coldness
of
her
hand
when
I
touched
it
<EOS>
,
I
can
feel
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Its
only
sign
of
animation
was
to
shrink
from
mine
;
and
then
she
glided
from
the
chair
,
and
creeping
to
the
other
side
of
her
uncle
,
bowed
herself
,
silently
and
trembling
still
,
upon
his
breast
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
such
a
loving
art
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
smoothing
her
rich
hair
with
his
great
hard
hand
,
"
that
it
ca
n't
abear
the
sorrer
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
nat'ral
in
young
folk
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
when
they
're
new
to
these
here
trials
,
and
timid
,
like
my
little
bird
,
<EOS>
---
it
's
nat'ral
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
clung
the
closer
to
him
,
but
neither
lifted
up
her
face
,
nor
spoke
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
getting
late
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
and
<EOS>
here
's
Ham
<EOS>
come
fur
to
take
you
home
.
 
<EOS>
Theer
!
 
<EOS>
Go
along
with
t'other
loving
art
!
 
<EOS>
What
,
Em'ly
?
 
<EOS>
Eh
,
my
pretty
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
sound
of
her
voice
had
not
reached
me
,
but
he
bent
his
head
as
if
he
listened
to
her
,
and
then
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Let
you
stay
with
your
uncle
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
you
doen't
mean
to
ask
me
that
!
 
<EOS>
Stay
with
your
uncle
,
Moppet
?
 
<EOS>
When
your
husband
that
'll
be
so
soon
,
is
here
fur
to
take
you
home
?
 
<EOS>
Now
a
person
would
n't
think
it
,
fur
to
see
this
little
thing
alongside
a
rough
-
weather
chap
like
me
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
looking
round
at
both
of
us
,
with
infinite
pride
;
"
but
the
sea
ai
n't
more
salt
in
it
than
she
has
fondness
in
her
for
her
uncle
---
a
foolish
little
Em'ly
<EOS>
!
"
   
"
Em'ly
's
in
the
right
in
that
,
Mas'r
Davy
!
"
said
Ham
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lookee
here
!
 
<EOS>
As
Em'ly
wishes
of
it
,
and
as
she
's
hurried
and
frightened
,
like
,
besides
,
I
'll
leave
her
till
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
stay
too
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
doen't
ought
---
<EOS>
a
married
man
like
you
---
or
what
's
as
good
---
to
take
and
hull
away
a
day
's
work
.
<EOS>
And
you
doen't
ought
to
watch
and
work
both
.
 
<EOS>
That
wo
n't
do
.
 
<EOS>
You
go
home
and
turn
in
.
 
<EOS>
You
ai
n't
afeerd
of
Em'ly
not
being
took
good
care
on
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
Ham
yielded
to
this
persuasion
,
and
took
his
hat
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
he
kissed
her
.
 
<EOS>
---
and
I
never
saw
him
approach
her
,
but
I
felt
that
nature
had
given
him
the
soul
of
a
gentleman
<EOS>
---
she
seemed
to
cling
closer
to
her
uncle
,
even
to
the
avoidance
of
her
chosen
husband
.
<EOS>
I
shut
the
door
after
him
,
that
it
might
cause
no
disturbance
of
the
quiet
that
prevailed
;
and
when
I
turned
back
,
I
found
Mr
Peggotty
still
talking
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
'm
a
going
upstairs
to
tell
your
aunt
as
Mas'r
Davy
's
here
,
and
that
'll
cheer
her
up
a
bit
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sit
ye
down
by
the
fire
,
the
while
,
my
dear
,
and
warm
those
mortal
cold
hands
.
 
<EOS>
You
<EOS>
doen't
need
to
be
so
fearsome
,
and
take
on
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
What
?
 
<EOS>
You
'll
go
along
with
me
?
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Well
!
come
along
with
me
---
come
!
 
<EOS>
If
her
uncle
was
turned
out
of
house
and
home
,
and
forced
to
lay
down
in
a
dyke
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
with
no
less
pride
than
before
,
<EOS>
"
it
's
my
belief
<EOS>
she
'd
go
along
with
him
,
now
!
 
<EOS>
But
there
'll
be
someone
else
,
soon
,
---
someone
else
,
soon
,
Em'ly
!
"
   
<EOS>
Afterwards
,
when
I
went
upstairs
,
as
I
passed
the
door
of
my
little
chamber
,
which
was
dark
,
I
had
an
indistinct
impression
of
her
being
within
it
,
cast
down
upon
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
whether
it
was
really
she
,
or
whether
it
was
a
confusion
of
the
shadows
in
the
room
,
I
do
n't
know
now
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
leisure
to
think
,
before
the
kitchen
fire
,
of
pretty
little
Emily
's
dread
of
death
---
which
,
added
to
what
Mr
Omer
had
told
me
,
I
took
to
be
the
cause
of
<EOS>
her
being
so
unlike
herself
---
<EOS>
and
I
had
leisure
,
before
Peggotty
came
down
,
even
to
think
more
leniently
of
the
weakness
of
it
:
as
I
sat
counting
the
ticking
of
the
clock
,
and
deepening
my
sense
of
the
solemn
hush
around
me
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
took
me
in
her
arms
,
and
blessed
and
thanked
me
over
and
over
again
for
being
such
a
comfort
to
her
<EOS>
(
that
was
what
she
said
)
in
her
distress
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
entreated
me
to
come
upstairs
,
sobbing
that
Mr
Barkis
had
always
liked
me
and
admired
me
;
that
he
had
often
talked
of
me
,
before
he
fell
into
a
stupor
;
and
that
she
believed
,
in
case
of
his
coming
to
himself
again
,
he
would
brighten
up
at
sight
of
me
,
if
he
could
brighten
up
at
any
earthly
thing
.
   
<EOS>
The
probability
of
his
ever
doing
so
,
appeared
to
me
,
when
I
saw
him
,
to
be
very
small
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
lying
with
his
head
and
shoulders
out
of
bed
,
in
an
uncomfortable
attitude
,
half
resting
on
the
box
which
had
cost
him
so
much
pain
and
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
I
learned
,
that
,
when
he
was
past
creeping
out
of
bed
to
open
it
,
and
past
assuring
himself
of
its
safety
by
means
of
the
divining
rod
I
had
seen
him
use
,
he
had
required
to
have
it
placed
on
the
chair
at
the
bed
-
side
,
where
he
had
ever
since
embraced
it
,
night
and
day
.
 
<EOS>
His
arm
lay
on
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
Time
and
the
world
were
slipping
from
beneath
him
,
but
the
box
was
there
;
and
the
last
words
he
had
uttered
were
(
in
an
explanatory
tone
)
<EOS>
"
Old
clothes
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Barkis
,
my
dear
!
"
said
Peggotty
,
almost
cheerfully
:
bending
over
him
,
while
her
brother
<EOS>
and
I
stood
at
the
bed
's
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
my
dear
boy
---
my
dear
boy
,
Master
Davy
,
who
brought
us
together
,
Barkis
!
 
<EOS>
That
you
sent
messages
by
,
you
know
!
 
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
speak
to
Master
Davy
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
as
mute
and
senseless
as
the
box
,
from
which
his
form
derived
the
only
expression
it
had
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
going
out
with
the
tide
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
to
me
,
behind
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
My
eyes
were
dim
and
so
were
Mr
Peggotty
's
;
but
I
repeated
in
a
whisper
,
"
With
the
tide
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
People
ca
n't
die
,
along
the
coast
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
except
when
the
tide
's
pretty
nigh
out
.
 
<EOS>
They
ca
n't
be
born
,
unless
it
's
pretty
nigh
in
---
not
properly
born
,
till
flood
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
a
going
out
with
the
tide
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
ebb
at
half
-
arter
three
,
slack
water
half
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
lives
till
it
turns
,
he
'll
hold
his
own
till
past
the
flood
,
and
go
out
with
the
next
tide
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
remained
there
,
watching
him
,
a
long
time
---
hours
.
 
<EOS>
What
mysterious
influence
my
presence
had
upon
him
in
that
state
of
his
senses
,
I
shall
not
pretend
to
say
;
but
when
he
at
last
began
to
wander
feebly
,
it
is
certain
he
was
muttering
about
driving
me
to
school
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
coming
to
himself
,
"
said
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
touched
me
,
and
whispered
with
much
awe
and
reverence
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
both
a
-
going
out
fast
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Barkis
,
my
dear
!
"
said
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
C
P
Barkis
,
"
he
cried
faintly
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
better
woman
anywhere
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Look
!
 
<EOS>
Here
's
Master
Davy
!
"
said
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
For
he
now
opened
his
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
on
the
point
of
asking
him
if
he
knew
me
,
when
he
tried
to
stretch
out
his
arm
,
and
said
to
me
,
distinctly
,
with
a
pleasant
smile
:
   
<EOS>
"
Barkis
is
willin
'
!
"
   
<EOS>
And
,
it
being
low
water
,
he
went
out
with
the
tide
.
      
<EOS>
Chapter
31
.
<EOS>
A
greater
loss
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
difficult
for
me
,
on
Peggotty
's
solicitation
,
to
resolve
to
stay
where
I
was
,
until
after
the
remains
of
the
poor
carrier
should
have
made
their
last
journey
to
Blunderstone
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
long
ago
bought
,
out
of
her
own
savings
,
a
little
piece
of
ground
in
our
old
churchyard
near
the
grave
of
"
her
sweet
girl
"
,
as
she
always
called
my
mother
;
and
there
they
were
to
rest
.
   
<EOS>
In
keeping
Peggotty
company
,
and
doing
all
I
could
for
her
(
little
enough
at
the
utmost
)
,
I
was
as
grateful
<EOS>
,
I
rejoice
to
think
,
as
even
now
I
could
wish
myself
to
have
been
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
afraid
I
had
a
supreme
satisfaction
,
of
a
personal
and
professional
nature
,
in
taking
charge
of
Mr
Barkis
's
will
,
and
expounding
its
contents
.
   
<EOS>
I
may
claim
the
merit
of
having
originated
the
suggestion
that
the
will
should
be
looked
for
in
the
box
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
search
,
it
was
found
in
the
box
,
at
the
bottom
of
a
horse
's
nose
-
bag
;
wherein
(
besides
hay
)
there
was
discovered
an
old
gold
watch
,
with
chain
and
seals
,
which
Mr
Barkis
had
worn
on
his
wedding
-
day
,
and
which
had
never
been
seen
before
or
since
;
a
silver
tobacco
-
stopper
,
in
the
form
of
a
leg
;
an
imitation
lemon
,
full
of
minute
cups
and
saucers
,
which
I
have
some
idea
<EOS>
Mr
Barkis
must
have
purchased
to
present
to
me
when
I
was
a
child
,
and
afterwards
found
himself
unable
to
part
with
;
<EOS>
eighty
-
seven
guineas
and
a
half
,
in
guineas
and
half
-
guineas
;
two
hundred
and
ten
pounds
,
in
perfectly
clean
Bank
notes
;
certain
receipts
for
Bank
of
England
stock
;
an
old
horseshoe
,
a
bad
shilling
,
a
piece
of
camphor
,
and
an
oyster
-
shell
.
<EOS>
From
the
circumstance
of
the
latter
article
having
been
much
polished
,
and
displaying
prismatic
colours
on
the
inside
,
I
conclude
that
Mr
Barkis
had
some
general
ideas
about
pearls
,
which
never
resolved
themselves
into
anything
definite
.
   
<EOS>
For
years
and
years
,
Mr
Barkis
had
carried
this
box
,
on
all
his
journeys
,
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
That
it
might
the
better
escape
notice
,
he
had
invented
a
fiction
that
it
belonged
to
"
Mr
Blackboy
"
,
and
was
"
to
be
left
with
Barkis
till
called
for
"
;
a
fable
he
had
elaborately
written
on
the
lid
,
in
characters
now
scarcely
legible
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
hoarded
,
all
these
years
,
I
found
,
to
good
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
His
property
in
money
amounted
to
nearly
three
thousand
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
Of
this
he
bequeathed
the
interest
of
one
thousand
to
Mr
Peggotty
for
his
life
;
on
his
decease
,
the
principal
to
be
equally
divided
between
Peggotty
,
little
Emily
,
and
me
,
or
the
survivor
or
survivors
of
us
,
share
and
share
alike
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
rest
he
died
possessed
of
<EOS>
,
he
bequeathed
to
Peggotty
;
whom
he
left
residuary
legatee
,
and
sole
executrix
of
that
his
last
will
and
testament
.
   
<EOS>
I
felt
myself
quite
a
proctor
when
I
read
this
document
aloud
with
all
possible
ceremony
,
and
set
forth
its
provisions
,
any
number
of
times
,
to
those
whom
they
concerned
.
 
<EOS>
I
began
to
think
there
was
more
in
the
Commons
than
I
had
supposed
.
 
<EOS>
I
examined
the
will
with
the
deepest
attention
,
pronounced
it
perfectly
formal
in
all
respects
,
made
a
pencil
-
mark
or
so
in
the
margin
,
and
thought
it
rather
extraordinary
that
I
knew
so
much
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
abstruse
pursuit
;
in
making
an
account
for
Peggotty
,
of
all
the
property
into
which
she
had
come
;
in
arranging
all
the
affairs
in
an
orderly
manner
;
and
in
being
her
referee
and
adviser
on
every
point
,
to
our
joint
delight
;
I
passed
the
week
before
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
see
little
Emily
in
that
interval
,
but
they
told
me
she
was
to
be
quietly
married
in
a
fortnight
.
   
<EOS>
I
did
not
attend
the
funeral
in
character
,
if
I
may
venture
to
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
I
was
not
dressed
up
in
a
black
coat
and
a
streamer
,
to
frighten
the
birds
;
but
I
walked
over
to
Blunderstone
early
in
the
morning
,
and
was
in
the
churchyard
when
it
came
,
attended
only
by
Peggotty
and
her
brother
.
 
<EOS>
The
mad
gentleman
looked
on
,
out
of
my
little
window
;
Mr
Chillip
's
baby
wagged
its
heavy
head
,
and
rolled
its
goggle
eyes
,
at
the
clergyman
,
over
its
nurse
's
shoulder
;
Mr
Omer
breathed
short
in
the
background
;
no
one
else
was
there
;
and
it
was
very
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
We
walked
about
the
churchyard
for
an
hour
,
after
all
was
over
;
and
pulled
some
young
leaves
from
the
tree
above
my
mother
's
grave
.
   
<EOS>
A
dread
falls
on
me
here
.
 
<EOS>
A
cloud
is
lowering
on
the
distant
town
,
towards
which
I
retraced
my
solitary
steps
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
to
approach
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
think
of
what
did
come
,
upon
that
memorable
night
;
of
what
must
come
again
,
if
I
go
on
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
no
worse
,
because
I
write
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
no
better
,
if
I
stopped
my
most
unwilling
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
done
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
can
undo
it
;
nothing
can
make
it
otherwise
than
as
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
My
old
nurse
was
to
go
to
London
with
me
next
day
,
on
the
business
of
the
will
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Emily
was
passing
that
day
at
Mr
Omer
's
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
all
to
meet
in
the
old
boathouse
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
Ham
would
bring
Emily
at
the
usual
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
walk
back
at
my
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
The
brother
and
sister
would
return
as
they
had
come
,
and
be
expecting
us
,
when
the
day
closed
in
,
at
the
fireside
.
   
<EOS>
I
parted
from
them
at
the
wicket
-
gate
,
where
visionary
Strap
had
rested
with
Roderick
Random
's
knapsack
in
the
days
of
yore
;
and
,
instead
of
going
straight
back
,
walked
a
little
distance
on
the
road
to
Lowestoft
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
turned
,
and
walked
back
towards
Yarmouth
.
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
to
dine
at
a
decent
alehouse
,
some
mile
or
two
from
the
Ferry
I
have
mentioned
before
;
and
thus
the
day
wore
away
,
and
it
was
evening
when
I
reached
it
.
 
<EOS>
Rain
was
falling
heavily
by
that
time
,
and
it
was
a
wild
night
;
but
there
was
a
moon
behind
the
clouds
,
and
it
was
not
dark
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
soon
within
sight
of
Mr
Peggotty
's
house
,
and
of
the
light
within
it
shining
through
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
floundering
across
the
sand
,
which
was
heavy
,
brought
me
to
the
door
,
and
I
went
in
.
   
<EOS>
It
looked
very
comfortable
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
had
smoked
his
evening
pipe
and
there
were
preparations
for
some
supper
by
and
by
.
<EOS>
The
fire
was
bright
,
the
ashes
were
thrown
up
,
the
locker
was
ready
for
little
Emily
in
her
old
place
.
 
<EOS>
In
her
own
old
place
sat
Peggotty
,
once
more
,
looking
(
but
for
her
dress
)
as
if
she
had
never
left
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
fallen
back
,
already
,
on
the
society
of
the
work
-
box
with
St
Paul
's
upon
the
lid
,
the
yard
-
measure
in
the
cottage
,
and
the
bit
of
wax
-
candle
;
and
there
they
all
were
,
just
as
if
they
had
never
been
disturbed
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
appeared
to
be
fretting
a
little
,
in
her
old
corner
;
and
consequently
looked
quite
natural
,
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
first
of
the
lot
,
Mas'r
Davy
!
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
with
a
happy
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Doen't
keep
in
that
coat
,
sir
,
if
it
's
wet
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
said
I
,
giving
him
my
outer
coat
to
hang
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
dry
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
'
tis
!
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
feeling
my
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
a
chip
!
<EOS>
Sit
ye
down
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
o
'
no
use
saying
welcome
to
you
,
but
you
're
welcome
,
kind
and
hearty
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Mr
Peggotty
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Peggotty
!
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
giving
her
a
kiss
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
are
you
,
old
woman
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
"
laughed
Mr
Peggotty
,
sitting
down
beside
us
,
and
rubbing
his
hands
in
his
sense
of
relief
from
recent
trouble
,
and
in
the
genuine
heartiness
of
his
nature
;
"
there
's
not
a
woman
in
the
wureld
,
sir
---
as
I
tell
her
---
that
need
to
feel
more
easy
in
her
mind
than
her
!
 
<EOS>
She
done
her
dooty
by
the
departed
,
and
the
departed
know'd
it
;
and
the
departed
done
what
was
right
by
her
,
as
she
done
what
was
right
by
the
departed
;
---
and
---
and
<EOS>
---
and
it
's
all
right
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
groaned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Cheer
up
,
my
pritty
mawther
!
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
(
But
he
shook
his
head
aside
at
us
,
evidently
sensible
of
the
tendency
of
the
late
occurrences
to
recall
the
memory
of
the
old
one
.
)
<EOS>
"
Doen't
be
down
!
 
<EOS>
Cheer
up
,
for
your
own
self
,
on'y
a
little
bit
,
and
see
if
a
good

more
doen't
come
nat'ral

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
to
me
,
Dan'l
,
"
returned
Mrs
Gummidge
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothink
's
nat'ral
to
me
but
<EOS>
to
be
lone
and
lorn
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No

no

"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
soothing
her
sorrows
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
Dan'l
!
"
said
Mrs
Gummidge
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ai
n't
a
person
to
live
with
them
as
has
had
money
left
.
 
<EOS>
Thinks
go
too
contrary
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
better
be
a
riddance
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
should
I
ever
spend
it
without
you
?
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
with
an
air
of
serious
remonstrance
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
a
talking
on
?
<EOS>
Doen't
<EOS>
I
want
you
more
now
,
than
ever
I
did
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know'd
<EOS>
I
was
never
wanted
before
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Gummidge
,
with
a
pitiable
whimper
,
"
and
now
I
'm
told
so
!
 
<EOS>
How
could
I
expect
to
be
wanted
,
being
so
lone
and
lorn
,
and
so
contrary
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
seemed
very
much
shocked
at
himself
for
having
made
a
speech
capable
of
this
unfeeling
construction
,
but
was
prevented
from
replying
,
by
Peggotty
's
pulling
his
sleeve
,
and
shaking
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
After
looking
at
Mrs
Gummidge
for
some
moments
,
in
sore
distress
of
mind
,
he
glanced
at
the
Dutch
clock
,
rose
,
snuffed
the
candle
,
and
put
it
in
the
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
Theer
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
cheerily
.
<EOS>
"
Theer
we
are
,
Missis
Gummidge
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
slightly
groaned
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lighted
up
,
accordin
'
to
custom
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
wonderin

<EOS>
what

<EOS>
Well

it

fur

<EOS>
You

the

over

cheerful
arter

when
I
'm
here
at
the
hour
as

<EOS>
home
,
I
puts
the
light

winder

<EOS>
That

"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
bending
over
me
with
great
glee
,
"
meets
two
objects
.
<EOS>
She
says
,
says
Em'ly
,
"
Theer

<EOS>
she
says

<EOS>
And
likewise

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
baby

"
<EOS>
said
Peggotty
;
<EOS>
very
fond
of
him
for
it
,
if
she
thought
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
returned
Mr
Peggotty
,
standing
with
his
legs
pretty
wide
apart
,
and
rubbing
his
hands
up
and
down
them
in
his
comfortable
satisfaction
,
as
he
looked
alternately
at
us
and
at
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
doen't
know
<EOS>

I
am

<EOS>
Not

<EOS>
"
Not
azackly
,
"
observed
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
laughed
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
not
to
look
at

but
to

to
consider
on

you

<EOS>
I
doen't

<EOS>
Now
I
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
go
a
looking

looking
about
that
theer
pritty
house
of
our
Em'ly

I

<EOS>
I

said
Mr
Peggotty
,
with
sudden
emphasis
---
"
theer

<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
more
---
<EOS>
if
I
doen't
feel
as

<EOS>
I
takes

up

I
put

touches

There

"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
relieving
his
earnestness
with
a
roar
of
laughter
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
and
I
both
laughed
,
but
not
so
loud
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
opinion
,
you
see
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
with
a
delighted
face
,
after
some
further
rubbing
of
his
legs
,
"
as
this
is
along
of
my
havin'
played
with
her
so
much

<EOS>
Why

this

candle

"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
gleefully
holding
out
his
hand
towards
it
,
"
I
know

well

that

<EOS>
THERE

said
Mr
Peggotty
,
with
another
roar
,
"
in
the
form

a

Porkypine

<EOS>
Why

at

minute

the

sparkle
up

I
says
to

Em'ly

<EOS>
THERE

<EOS>
Right
for
all
that
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
stopping
in
his
roar
,
and
smiting
his
hands
together
;
"
fur
here
she
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
only
Ham
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
should
have
turned
more
wet
since
I
came
in
,
for
he
had
a
large
sou'wester
hat
on
,
slouched
over
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wheer
's
Em'ly
?
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
Ham
made
a
motion
with
his
head
,
as
if
she
were
outside
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
took
the
light
from
the
window
,
trimmed
it
,
put
it
on
the
table
,
and
was
busily
stirring
the
fire
,
when
Ham
,
who
had
not
moved
,
said
:
   
"
Mas'r
Davy
,
will
you
come
out
a
minute
,
and
see
what
Em'ly
and
me
has
got
to
show
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
We
went
out
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
passed
him
at
the
door
,
I
saw
,
to
my
astonishment
and
fright

that
he
was
deadly
pale
.
 
<EOS>
He
pushed
me
hastily
into
the
open
air
,
and
closed
the
door
upon
us
.
 
<EOS>
Only
upon
us
two
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ham
!
<EOS>
what
's
the
matter
?

<EOS>

Mas'r
Davy

<EOS>
"
Oh
,
for
his
broken
heart
,
how
dreadfully
he
wept
!
   
<EOS>
I
was
paralysed
by
the
sight
of
such
grief
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
I
thought
,
or
what
I
dreaded
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
only
look
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ham
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
good
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
tell
me
what
's
the
matter

<EOS>
"
My
love

Mas'r
Davy

the
pride
and
hope
of
my
art

her
that
I
'd
have
died
for
,

would
die
for

"
Gone

Em'ly
's

<EOS>
Oh
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
think
HOW
<EOS>
she
's
run
away
,
when
I
pray
my
good
and
gracious
God
to
kill
her
(
her
<EOS>
that
is
so
dear
above
all
things
)
<EOS>
sooner
than
let
her
come
to
ruin
and
disgrace
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
face
he
turned
up
to
the
troubled
sky
,
the
quivering
of
his
clasped
hands
,
the
agony
of
his
figure
,
remain
associated
with
the
lonely
waste
,
in
my
remembrance
,
to
this
hour
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
always
night
there
,
and
he
is
the
only
object
in
the
scene
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
scholar
,
"
he
said
,
hurriedly
,
"
and
know
what
's
right
and
best
.
 
<EOS>
What
am
I
to
say
,
indoors
?
 
<EOS>
How
am
I
ever
to
break
it
to
him
,
Mas'r
Davy
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
saw
the
door
move
,
and
instinctively
tried
to
hold
the
latch
on
the
outside
,
to
gain
a
moment
's
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
thrust
forth
his
face
;
and
never
could
I
forget
the
change
that
came
upon
it
when
he
saw
us
,
if
I
were
to
live
five
hundred
years
.
   
<EOS>
I
remember
a
great
wail
and
cry
,
and
the
women
hanging
about
him
,
and
we
all
standing
in
the
room
;
I
with
a
paper
in
my
hand
,
which
Ham
had
given
me
;
Mr
Peggotty
,
with
his
vest
torn
open
,
his
hair
wild
,
his
face
and
lips
quite
white
,
and
blood
trickling
down
his
bosom
(
it
had
sprung
from
his
mouth
,
I
think
)
,
looking
fixedly
at
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Read
it
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
low
shivering
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Slow
,
please
.
<EOS>
I
doen't
know
as
I
can
understand
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
the
silence
of
death
,
I
read
thus
,
from
a
blotted
letter
:
   
"
<EOS>
"
When
you
,
who
love
me
so
much
better
than
I
ever
have
deserved
,
even
when
my
mind
was
innocent
,
see
this
,
I
shall
be
far
away
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
I
shall
be
fur
away
,
"
he
repeated
slowly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
 
<EOS>
Em'ly
fur
away
.
<EOS>
Well
!
"
   
"
"
When
I
leave
my
dear
home
---
my
dear
home
---
oh
,
my
dear
home
!
---
in
the
morning
,
"
"
 
the
letter
bore
date
on
the
previous
night
:
   
"
"
---
it
will
be
never
to
come
back
,
unless
he
brings
me
back
a
lady
.
<EOS>
This
will
be
found
at
night
,
many
hours
after
,
instead
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
you
knew
how
my
heart
is
torn
.
 
<EOS>
If
even
you
,
that
I
have
wronged
so
much
,
that
never
can
forgive
me
,
could
only
know
what
I
suffer
!
<EOS>
I
am
too
wicked
to
write
about
myself
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
take
comfort
in
thinking
that
I
am
so
bad
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
for
mercy
's
sake
,
tell
uncle
that
I
never
loved
him
half
so
dear
as
now
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
do
n't
remember
how
affectionate
and
kind
<EOS>
you
have
all
been
to
me
---
<EOS>
do
n't
remember
we
were
ever
to
be
married
---
but
try
to
think
as
if
I
died
when
I
was
little
,
and
was
buried
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
Heaven
that
I
am
going
away
from
,
have
compassion
on
my
uncle
!
 
<EOS>
Tell
him
that
I
never
loved
him
half
<EOS>
so
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Be
his
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
Love
some
good
girl
that
will
be
what
I
was
once
to
uncle
,
and
be
true
to
you
,
and
worthy
of
you
,
and
know
no
shame
but
me
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
all
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
pray
for
all
,
often
,
on
my
knees
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
do
n't
bring
me
back
a
lady
,
and
I
do
n't
pray
for
my
own
self
,
I
'll
pray
for
all
.
 
<EOS>
My
parting
love
to
uncle
.
<EOS>
My
last
tears
,
and
my
last
thanks
,
for
uncle
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
That
was
all
.
   
<EOS>
He
stood
,
long
after
I
had
ceased
to
read
,
still
looking
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
I
ventured
to
take
his
hand
,
and
to
entreat
him
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
to
endeavour
to
get
some
command
of
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
replied
,
"
I
thankee
,
sir
,
I
thankee
!
"
without
moving
.
   
<EOS>
Ham
spoke
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
was
so
far
sensible
of
HIS
affliction
,
that
he
wrung
his
hand
;
but
,
otherwise
,
he
remained
in
the
same
state
,
and
no
one
dared
to
disturb
him
.
   
<EOS>
Slowly
,
at
last
,
he
moved
his
eyes
from
my
face
,
as
if
he
were
waking
from
a
vision
,
and
cast
them
round
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
said
,
in
a
low
voice
:
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
the
man
?
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
his
name
.
"
   
<EOS>
Ham
glanced
at
me
,
and
suddenly
I
felt
a
shock
that
struck
me
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
man
suspected
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mas'r
Davy
!
"
<EOS>
implored
Ham
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
out
a
bit
,
and
let
me
tell
him
what
I
must
.
 
<EOS>
You
<EOS>
doen't
ought
to
hear
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
felt
the
shock
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
sank
down
in
a
chair
,
and
tried
to
utter
some
reply
;
but
my
tongue
was
fettered
,
and
my
sight
was
weak
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
know
his
name
!
<EOS>
"
I
heard
said
once
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
some
time
past
,
"
Ham
faltered
,
"
there
's
been
a
servant
about
here
,
at
odd
times
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
been
a
gen'lm'n
too
.
 
<EOS>
Both
of
'em
belonged
to
one
another
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
stood
fixed
as
before
,
but
now
looking
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
servant
,
"
pursued
Ham
,
"
was
seen
along
with
---
our
poor
girl
---
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
been
in
hiding
about
here
,
this
week
or
over
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
thought
to
have
gone
,
but
he
was
hiding
.
 
<EOS>
Doen't
stay
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
doen't
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
felt
Peggotty
's
arm
round
my
neck
,
but
I
could
not
have
moved
if
the
house
had
been
about
to
fall
upon
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
strange
chay
and
hosses
was
outside
town
,
this
morning
,
on
the
Norwich
road
,
<EOS>
a'most
afore
the
day
broke
,
"
Ham
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
servant
went
to
it
,
and
come
from
it
,
and
went
to
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
went
to
it
again
,
Em'ly
was
nigh
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
t'other
was
inside
.
<EOS>
He
's
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
the
Lord
's
love
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
falling
back
,
and
putting
out
his
hand
,
as
if
to
keep
off
what
he
dreaded
.
 
<EOS>
"
Doen't
tell
me
his
name
's
Steerforth
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
exclaimed
Ham
,
in
a
broken
voice
,
"
it
ai
n't
no
fault
of
yourn
---
and
I
am
far
from
laying
of
it
to
you
---
but
his
name
is
Steerforth
,
and
he
's
a
damned
villain
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
uttered
no
cry
,
and
shed
no
tear
,
and
moved
no
more
,
until
he
seemed
to
wake
again
,
all
at
once
,
and
pulled
down
his
rough
coat
from
its
peg
in
a
corner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bear
a
hand
with
this
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
struck
of
a
heap
,
and
ca
n't
do
it
,
"
he
said
,
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bear
a
hand
and
help
me
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
"
<EOS>
when
somebody
had
done
so
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
give
me
that
theer
hat
!
"
   
<EOS>
Ham
asked
him
whither
he
was
going
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
going
to
seek
my
niece
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
going
to
seek
my
Em'ly

<EOS>
I
'm
a
going
,
first
,
to
stave
in
that
theer
boat
,

sink
it
where
I
would
have
drownded
him
,
as
I
'm
a
living
soul

I
had
had
one
thought
of
what
was
in
him

<EOS>
As

sat
afore

he
said
,
wildly
,
holding
out
his
clenched
right
hand
,
"
as
he
sat
afore
me
,
face
to
face
,
strike
me
down
dead
,
but
I
'd
have
drownded
him
,

thought
it
right
!
<EOS>
---
I
'm
a
going
to
seek
my
niece

"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
cried
Ham
,
interposing
himself
before
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Anywhere
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
going
to
seek
my

back

tell

<EOS>
"
No
,
no
!
"
cried
Mrs
Gummidge
,
coming
between
them
,
in
a
fit
of
crying
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
Dan'l
,
not
as
you
are
now
.
 
<EOS>
Seek
her
in
a
little
while
,
my
lone
lorn
Dan'l
,
and
that
'll
be
but
right
!
<EOS>
but
not
as
you
are
now

<EOS>
Sit
ye
down
,
and
give
me
your
forgiveness
for
having
ever
been
a
worrit
to
you

Dan'l
---
<EOS>
what
have
my
contraries
ever
been
to
this
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
let
us
speak
a
word
about
them
times
when
she
was
first
an
orphan
,
and
when
Ham
was
too
,
and
when
I
was
a
poor
widder
woman
,
and
you
took
me
in
.
 
<EOS>
It
'll
soften
your
poor
heart
,
Dan'l
,
"
laying
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
,
"
and
you
'll
bear
your
sorrow
better
;
for
you
know
the
promise
,
Dan'l
,
"
As
you
have
done
it
unto
one
of
the
least
of
these
,
you
have
done
it
unto
me
"
,
---
and
that
can
never
fail
under
this
roof
<EOS>
,
that
's
been
our
shelter
for
so
many
,
many
year
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
quite
passive
now
;
and
when
I
heard
him
crying
,
the
impulse
that
had
been
upon
me
to
go
down
upon
my
knees
,
and
ask
their
pardon
for
the
desolation
I
had
caused
,
and
curse
Steerforth
,
yielded
to
a
better
feeling
,
My
overcharged
heart
found
the
same
relief
,
and
I
cried
too
.

Chapter
32
.
<EOS>
The
beginning
of
a
long
journey
 
<EOS>
What
is
natural
in
me
,
is
natural
in
many
other
men
,
I
infer
,
and
so
I
am
not
afraid
to
write
that
I
never
had
loved
Steerforth
better
than
when
the
ties
that
bound
me
to
him
were
broken
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
keen
distress
of
the
discovery
of
his
unworthiness
,
I
thought
more
of
all
that
was
brilliant
in
him
,
I
softened
more
towards
all
that
was
good
in
him
,
I
did
more
justice
to
the
qualities
that
might
have
made
him
a
man
of
a
noble
nature
and
a
great
name
,
than
ever
I
had
done
in
the
height
of
my
devotion
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Deeply
as
I
felt
my
own
unconscious
part
in
his
pollution
of
an
honest
home
,
I
believed
that
if
I
had
been
brought
face
to
face
with
him
,
I
could
not
have
uttered
one
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
loved
him
so
well
still
---
though
he
fascinated
me
no
longer
---
I
should
have
held
in
so
much
tenderness
the
memory
of
my
affection
for
him
,
that
I
think
I
should
have
been
as
weak
as
a
spirit
-
wounded
child
,
in
all
but
the
entertainment
of
a
thought
that
we
could
ever
be
re
-
united
.
<EOS>
That
thought
I
never
had
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
,
as
he
had
felt
,
that
all
was
at
an
end
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
What
his
remembrances
of
me
were
,
<EOS>
I
have
never
known
---
they
were
light
enough
,
perhaps
,
and
easily
dismissed
---
but
mine
of
him
were
as
the
remembrances
of
a
cherished
friend
,
who
was
dead
.
   
<EOS>
Yes
,
Steerforth
,
long
removed
from
the
scenes
of
this
poor
history
!
<EOS>
My
sorrow
may
bear
involuntary
witness
against
you
at
the
judgement
Throne
;
but
my
angry
thoughts
or
my
reproaches
never
will
,
I
know
!
   
<EOS>
The
news
of
what
had
happened
soon
spread
through
the
town
;
insomuch
that
as
I
passed
along
the
streets
next
morning
,
I
overheard
the
people
speaking
of
it
at
their
doors
.
 
<EOS>
Many
were
hard
upon
her
,
some
few
were
hard
upon
him
,
but
towards
her
second
father
and
her
lover
there
was
but
one
sentiment
.
 
<EOS>
Among
all
kinds
of
people
a
respect
for
them
in
their
distress
prevailed
,
which
was
full
of
gentleness
and
delicacy
.
 
<EOS>
The
seafaring
men
kept
apart
,
when
those
two
were
seen
early
,
walking
with
slow
steps
on
the
beach
;
and
stood
in
knots
,
talking
compassionately
among
themselves
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
on
the
beach
,
close
down
by
the
sea
,
that
I
found
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
easy
to
perceive
that
they
had
not
slept
all
last
night
,
even
if
Peggotty
had
failed
to
tell
me
of
their
still
sitting
just
as
I
left
them
,
when
it
was
broad
day
.
 
<EOS>
They
looked
worn
;
and
I
thought
Mr
Peggotty
's
head
was
bowed
in
one
night
more
than
in
all
the
years
I
had
known
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
were
both
as
grave
and
steady
as
the
sea
itself
,
then
lying
beneath
a
dark
sky
,
waveless
---
yet
with
a
heavy
roll
upon
it
,
as
if
it
breathed
in
its
rest
---
and
touched
,
on
the
horizon
,
with
a
strip
of
silvery
light
from
the
unseen
sun
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
had
a
mort
of
talk
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
to
me
,
when
we
had
all
three
walked
a
little
while
in
silence
,
"
of
what
we
ought
and
<EOS>
doen't
ought
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
see
our
course
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
happened
to
glance
at
Ham
,
then
looking
out
to
sea
upon
the
distant
light
,
and
a
frightful
thought
came
into
my
mind
---
not
that
his
face
was
angry
,
for
it
was
not
;
I
recall
nothing
but
an
expression
of
stern
determination
in
it
---
that
if
ever
he
encountered
Steerforth
,
he
would
kill
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dooty
here
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
is
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
going
to
seek
my
---
"
he
stopped
,
and
went
on
in
a
firmer
voice
:
"
<EOS>
I
'm
a
going
to
seek
her
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
my
dooty
evermore
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
when
I
asked
him
where
he
would
seek
her
,
and
inquired
if
I
were
going
to
London
tomorrow
?
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
had
not
gone
today
,
fearing
to
lose
the
chance
of
being
of
any
service
to
him
;
but
that
I
was
ready
to
go
when
he
would
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
along
with
you
,
sir
,
"
he
rejoined
,
"
if
you
're
agreeable
,
tomorrow
.
"
   
<EOS>
We
walked
again
,
for
a
while
,
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ham
,
"
he
presently
resumed
,
"
he
'll
hold
to
his
present
work
,
and
go
and
live
along
with
my
sister
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
boat
yonder
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
Will
you
desert
the
old
boat
,
Mr
Peggotty
?
<EOS>
"
I
gently
interposed
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
station
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
he
returned
,
"
ai
n't
there
no
longer
;
and
if
ever
a
boat
foundered
,
since
there
was
darkness
on
the
face
of
the
deep
,
that
one
's
gone
down
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
,
sir
,
no
;
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
doen't
mean
as
it
should
be
deserted
.
 
<EOS>
Fur
from
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
We
walked
again
for
a
while
,
as
before
,
until
he
explained
:
   
<EOS>
"
My
wishes
is
,
sir
,
as
it
shall
look
,
day
and
night
,
winter
and
summer
,
as
it
has
always
looked
,
since
she
fust
know'd
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
ever
she
should
come
a
wandering
back
,
I
would
n't
have
the
old
place
seem
to
cast
her
off
,
you
understand
,
but
seem
to
tempt
her
to
draw
nigher
to
'
t
,
and
to
peep
in
,
maybe
,
like
a
ghost
,
out
of
the
wind
and
rain
,
through
the
old
winder
,
at
the
old
seat
by
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Then
,
maybe
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
seein
'
none
but
Missis
Gummidge
there
,
she
might
take
heart
to
creep
in
,
trembling
;
and
might
come
to
be
laid
down
in
her
old
bed
,
and
rest
her
weary
head
where
it
was
once
so
gay
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
speak
to
him
in
reply
,
though
I
tried
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Every
night
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
as
reg'lar
as
the
night
comes
,
the
candle
must
be
stood
in
its
old
pane
of
glass
,
that
if
ever
she
should
see
it
,
it
may
seem
to
say
"
Come
back
,
my
child
,
come
back
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
ever
there
's
a
knock
,
Ham
(
partic'ler
a
soft
knock
)
,
arter
dark
,
at
your
aunt
's
door
,
<EOS>
doen't
<EOS>
you
go
nigh
it
.
 
<EOS>
Let
it
be
her
---
not
you
---
that
sees
my
fallen
child
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
walked
a
little
in
front
of
us
,
and
kept
before
us
for
some
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
During
this
interval
,
I
glanced
at
Ham
again
,
and
observing
the
same
expression
on
his
face
,
and
his
eyes
still
directed
to
the
distant
light
,
I
touched
his
arm
.
   
<EOS>
Twice
I
called
him
by
his
name
,
in
the
tone
in
which
I
might
have
tried
to
rouse
a
sleeper
,
before
he
heeded
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
at
last
inquired
on
what
his
thoughts
were
so
bent
,
he
replied
:
   
"
<EOS>
On
what
's
afore
me
,
Mas'r
Davy
;
and
over
yon
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
the
life
before
you
,
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
He
had
pointed
confusedly
out
to
sea
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
Mas'r
Davy
.
 
<EOS>
I
doen't
rightly
know
how
'
tis
,
but
from
over
yon
there
seemed
to
me
to
come
---
<EOS>
the
end
of
it
like
,
"
looking
at
me
as
if
he
were
waking
,
but
with
the
same
determined
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
end
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
possessed
by
my
former
fear
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
doen't
know
,
"
he
said
,
thoughtfully
;
"
I
was
calling
to
mind
that
the
beginning
of
it
all
did
take
place
here
---
<EOS>
and
then
the
end
come
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
gone
!
 
<EOS>
Mas'r
Davy
<EOS>
,
"
he
added
;
answering
,
as
I
think
,
my
look
;
"
you
han't
no
call
to
be
afeerd
of
me
:
<EOS>
but
I
'm
kiender
muddled
;
I
do
n't
fare
to
feel
no
matters
,
"
---
<EOS>
which
was
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
was
not
himself
,
and
quite
confounded
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
stopping
for
us
to
join
him
:
we
did
so
,
and
said
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
The
remembrance
of
this
,
in
connexion
with
my
former
thought
,
however
,
haunted
me
at
intervals
,
even
until
the
inexorable
end
came
at
its
appointed
time
.
   
<EOS>
We
insensibly
approached
the
old
boat
,
and
entered
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
,
no
longer
moping
in
her
especial
corner
,
was
busy
preparing
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
Mr
Peggotty
's
hat
,
and
placed
his
seat
for
him
,
and
spoke
so
comfortably
and
softly
,
that
I
hardly
knew
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dan'l
,
my
good
man
,
"
said
she
,
"
you
must
eat
and
drink
,
and
keep
up
your
strength
,
for
without
it
you
'll
do
nowt
.
 
<EOS>
Try
,
that
's
a
dear
soul
!
 
<EOS>
An
if
I
disturb
you
with
my
clicketten
,
"
she
meant
her
chattering
,
"
tell
me
so
,
Dan'l
,
and
I
wo
n't
.
"
   
<EOS>
When
she
had
served
us
all
,
she
withdrew
to
the
window
,
where
she
sedulously
employed
herself
in
repairing
some
shirts
and
other
clothes
belonging
to
Mr
Peggotty
,
and
neatly
folding
and
packing
them
in
an
old
oilskin
bag
,
such
as
sailors
carry
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
she
continued
talking
,
in
the
same
quiet
manner
:
   
<EOS>
"
All
times
and
seasons
,
you
know
,
Dan'l
,
"
said
Mrs
Gummidge
,
"
I
shall
be
allus
here
,
and
everythink
will
look
accordin
'
to
your
wishes
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
poor
scholar
,
but
I
shall
write
to
you
,
odd
times
,
when
you
're
away
,
and
send
my
letters
to
Mas'r
Davy
.
 
<EOS>
Maybe
you
'll
write
to
me
too
,
Dan'l
,
odd
times
,
and
tell
me
how
you
fare
to
feel
upon
your
lone
lorn
journies
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
a
solitary
woman
heer
<EOS>
,
I
'm
afeerd
!
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
Dan'l
<EOS>
,
"
she
returned
,
"
I
sha
n't
be
that
.
 
<EOS>
Doen't
you
mind
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
have
enough
to
do
to
keep
a
Beein
for
you
"
<EOS>
(
Mrs
Gummidge
meant
a
home
)
,
"
again
you
come
back
---
to
keep
a
Beein
here
for
any
that
may
hap
to
come
back
,
Dan'l
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
fine
time
,
I
shall
set
outside
the
door
as
I
used
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
should
come
nigh
,
they
shall
see
the
old
widder
woman
true
to
'em
,
a
long
way
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
What
a
change
in
Mrs
Gummidge
in
a
little
time
!
 
<EOS>
She
was
another
woman
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
so
devoted
,
she
had
such
a
quick
perception
of
what
it
would
be
well
to
say
,
and
what
it
would
be
well
to
leave
unsaid
;
she
was
so
forgetful
of
herself
,
and
so
regardful
of
the
sorrow
about
her
,
that
I
held
her
in
a
sort
of
veneration
.
 
<EOS>
The
work
she
did
that
day
!
 
<EOS>
There
were
many
things
to
be
brought
up
from
the
beach
and
stored
in
the
outhouse
---
as
oars
,
nets
,
sails
,
cordage
,
spars
,
lobster
-
pots
,
bags
of
ballast
,
and
the
like
;
and
though
there
was
abundance
of
assistance
rendered
,
there
being
not
a
pair
of
working
hands
on
all
that
shore
but
would
have
laboured
hard
for
Mr
Peggotty
,
and
been
well
paid
in
being
asked
to
do
it
,
yet
she
persisted
,
all
day
long
,
in
toiling
under
weights
that
she
was
quite
unequal
to
,
and
fagging
to
and
fro
on
all
sorts
of
unnecessary
errands
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
deploring
her
misfortunes
,
she
appeared
to
have
entirely
lost
the
recollection
of
ever
having
had
any
.
 
<EOS>
She
preserved
an
equable
cheerfulness
in
the
midst
of
her
sympathy
,
which
was
not
the
least
astonishing
part
of
the
change
that
had
come
over
her
.
 
<EOS>
Querulousness
was
out
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
even
observe
her
voice
to
falter
,
or
a
tear
to
escape
from
her
eyes
,
the
whole
day
through
,
until
twilight
;
when
she
and
I
and
Mr
Peggotty
being
alone
together
,
and
he
having
fallen
asleep
in
perfect
exhaustion
,
she
broke
into
a
half
-
suppressed
fit
of
sobbing
and
crying
,
and
taking
me
to
the
door
,
said
,
"
Ever
bless
you
,
Mas'r
Davy
<EOS>
,
be
a
friend
to
him
,
poor
dear
!
"
<EOS>
Then
,
she
immediately
ran
out
of
the
house
to
wash
her
face
,
in
order
that
she
might
sit
quietly
beside
him
,
and
be
found
at
work
there
,
when
he
should
awake
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
I
left
her
,
when
I
went
away
at
night
,
the
prop
and
staff
of
Mr
Peggotty
's
affliction
;
and
I
could
not
meditate
enough
upon
the
lesson
that
I
read
in
Mrs
Gummidge
,
and
the
new
experience
she
unfolded
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
between
nine
and
ten
o'clock
<EOS>
when
,
strolling
in
a
melancholy
manner
through
the
town
,
I
stopped
at
Mr
Omer
's
door
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Omer
had
taken
it
so
much
to
heart
,
his
daughter
told
me
,
that
he
had
been
very
low
and
poorly
all
day
,
and
had
gone
to
bed
without
his
pipe
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
deceitful
,
bad
-
hearted
girl
,
"
said
Mrs
Joram
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
good
in
her
,
ever
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
so
,
"
I
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Joram
,
angrily
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
<EOS>
I.
   
Mrs
Joram
tossed
her
head
,
endeavouring
to
be
very
stern
and
cross
;
but
she
could
not
command
her
softer
self
,
and
began
to
cry
.
<EOS>
I
was
young
,
to
be
sure
;
but
I
thought
much
the
better
of
her
for
this
sympathy
,
and
fancied
it
became
her
,
as
a
virtuous
wife
and
mother
,
very
well
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
will
she
ever
do
!
"
<EOS>
sobbed
Minnie
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
will
she
go
!
 
<EOS>
What
will
become
of
her
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
could
she
be
so
cruel
,
to
herself
and
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
remembered
the
time
when
Minnie
was
a
young
and
pretty
girl
;
and
I
was
glad
she
remembered
it
too
,
so
feelingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
little
Minnie
,
"
said
Mrs
Joram
,
"
has
only
just
now
been
got
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Even
in
her
sleep
she
is
sobbing
for
Em'ly
.
 
<EOS>
All
day
long
,
little
Minnie
has
cried
for
her
,
and
asked
me
,
over
and
over
again
,
whether
Em'ly
was
wicked
?
 
<EOS>
What
can
I
say
to
her
,
when
Em'ly
tied
a
ribbon
off
her
own
neck
round
little
Minnie
's
the
last
night
she
was
here
,
and
laid
her
head
down
on
the
pillow
beside
her
till
she
was
fast
asleep
!
 
<EOS>
The
ribbon
's
round
my
little
Minnie
's
neck
now
.
<EOS>
It
ought
not
to
be
,
perhaps
,
but
what
can
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
Em'ly
is
very
bad
,
but
they
were
fond
of
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
child
knows
nothing
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Joram
was
so
unhappy
that
her
husband
came
out
to
take
care
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
Leaving
them
together
,
I
went
home
to
Peggotty
's
;
more
melancholy
myself
,
if
possible
,
than
I
had
been
yet
.
   
<EOS>
That
good
creature
---
<EOS>
I
mean
Peggotty
---
all
<EOS>
untired
by
her
late
anxieties
and
sleepless
nights
,
was
at
her
brother
's
,
where
she
meant
to
stay
till
morning
.
 
<EOS>
An
old
woman
,
who
had
been
employed
about
the
house
for
some
weeks
past
,
while
Peggotty
had
been
unable
to
attend
to
it
,
was
the
house
's
only
other
occupant
besides
myself
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
had
no
occasion
for
her
services
,
I
sent
her
to
bed
,
by
no
means
against
her
will
,
and
sat
down
before
the
kitchen
fire
a
little
while
,
to
think
about
all
this
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
blending
it
with
the
deathbed
of
the
late
Mr
Barkis
,
and
was
driving
out
with
the
tide
towards
the
distance
at
which
Ham
had
looked
so
singularly
in
the
morning
,
when
I
was
recalled
from
my
wanderings
by
a
knock
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
knocker
upon
the
door
,
but
it
was
not
that
which
made
the
sound
.
 
<EOS>
The
tap
was
from
a
hand
,
and
low
down
upon
the
door
,
as
if
it
were
given
by
a
child
.
   
<EOS>
It
made
me
start
as
much
as
if
it
had
been
the
knock
of
a
footman
to
a
person
of
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
I
opened
the
door
;
and
at
first
looked
down
,
to
my
amazement
,
on
nothing
but
a
great
umbrella
that
appeared
to
be
walking
about
of
itself
.
 
<EOS>
But
presently
I
discovered
underneath
it
,
Miss
Mowcher
.
   
<EOS>
I
might
not
have
been
prepared
to
give
the
little
creature
a
very
kind
reception
,
if
,
on
her
removing
the
umbrella
,
which
her
utmost
efforts
were
unable
to
shut
up
,
she
had
shown
me
the
"
volatile
"
expression
of
face
which
had
made
so
great
an
impression
on
me
at
our
first
and
last
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
But
her
face
,
as
she
turned
it
up
to
mine
,
was
so
earnest
;
and
when
I
relieved
her
of
the
umbrella
<EOS>
(
which
would
have
been
an
inconvenient
one
for
the
Irish
Giant
)
,
she
wrung
her
little
hands
in
such
an
afflicted
manner
;
that
I
rather
inclined
towards
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Mowcher
!
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
after
glancing
up
and
down
the
empty
street
,
without
distinctly
knowing
what
I
expected
to
see
besides
;
"
how
do
you
come
here
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
She
motioned
to
me
with
her
short
right
arm
,
to
shut
the
umbrella
for
her
;
and
passing
me
hurriedly
,
went
into
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
had
closed
the
door
,
and
followed
,
with
the
umbrella
in
my
hand
,
I
found
her
sitting
on
the
corner
of
the
fender
<EOS>
---
it
was
a
low
iron
one
,
with
two
flat
bars
at
top
to
stand
plates
upon
---
in
the
shadow
of
the
boiler
,
swaying
herself
backwards
and
forwards
,
and
chafing
her
hands
upon
her
knees
like
a
person
in
pain
.
   
<EOS>
Quite
alarmed
at
being
the
only
recipient
of
this
untimely
visit
,
and
the
only
spectator
of
this
portentous
behaviour
<EOS>
,
I
exclaimed
again
,
"
Pray
tell
me
,
Miss
Mowcher
,
what
is
the
matter
!
<EOS>
are
you
ill
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
young
soul
,
"
returned
Miss
Mowcher
,
squeezing
her
hands
upon
her
heart
one
over
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
ill
here
,
I
am
very
ill
.
<EOS>
To
think
that
it
should
come
to
this
,
when
I
might
have
known
it
and
perhaps
prevented
it
,
if
I
had
n't
been
a
thoughtless
fool
!
"
   
<EOS>
Again
her
large
bonnet
(
very
disproportionate
to
the
figure
)
went
backwards
and
forwards
,
in
her
swaying
of
her
little
body
to
and
fro
;
while
a
most
gigantic
bonnet
rocked
,
in
unison
with
it
,
upon
the
wall
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
surprised
,
"
I
began
,
"
to
see
you
so
distressed
and
serious
"
---
when
she
interrupted
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
it
's
always
so
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
all
surprised
,
these
inconsiderate
young
people
,
fairly
and
full
grown
,
to
see
any
natural
feeling
in
a
little
thing
like
me
!
 
<EOS>
They
make
a
plaything
of
me
,
use
me
for
their
amusement
,
throw
me
away
when
they
are
tired
,
and
wonder
that
I
feel
more
than
a
toy
horse
or
a
wooden
soldier
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
that
's
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
way
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
,
with
others
,
"
I
returned
,
"
but
I
do
assure
you
it
is
not
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
ought
not
to
be
at
all
surprised
to
see
you
as
you
are
now
:
<EOS>
I
know
so
little
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
without
consideration
,
what
I
thought
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
can
I
do
?
"
returned
the
little
woman
,
standing
up
,
and
holding
out
her
arms
to
show
herself
.
 
<EOS>
"
See
!
 
<EOS>
What
I
am
,
my
father
was
;
and
my
sister
is
;
and
my
brother
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
worked
for
sister
and
brother
these
many
years
---
<EOS>
hard
,
Mr
Copperfield
---
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
live
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
no
harm
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
are
people
so
unreflecting
or
so
cruel
,
as
to
make
a
jest
of
me
,
what
is
left
for
me
to
do
but
to
make
a
jest
of
myself
,
them
,
and
everything
?
 
<EOS>
If
I
do
so
,
for
the
time
,
whose
fault
is
that
?
 
<EOS>
Mine
?
"
   
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
Not
Miss
Mowcher
's
,
I
perceived
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
shown
myself
a
sensitive
dwarf
to
your
false
friend
,
"
pursued
the
little
woman
,
shaking
her
head
at
me
,
with
reproachful
earnestness
,
"
<EOS>
how
much
of
his
help
or
good
will
do
you
think
I
should
ever
have
had
?
 
<EOS>
If
little
Mowcher
(
who
had
no
hand
,
young
gentleman
,
in
the
making
of
herself
)
addressed
herself
to
him
,
or
the
like
of
him
,
because
of
her
misfortunes
,
when
do
you
suppose
her
small
voice
would
have
been
heard
?
 
<EOS>
Little
Mowcher
would
have
as
much
need
to
live
,
if
she
was
the
bitterest
and
dullest
of
pigmies
;
but
she
could
n't
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
She
might
whistle
for
her
bread
and
butter
till
she
died
of
Air
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Mowcher
sat
down
on
the
fender
again
,
and
took
out
her
handkerchief
,
and
wiped
her
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Be
thankful
for
me
,
if
you
have
a
kind
heart
,
as
I
think
you
have
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
while
I
know
well
what
I
am
,
I
can
be
cheerful
and
endure
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
thankful
for
myself
,
at
any
rate
,
that
I
can
find
my
tiny
way
through
the
world
,
without
being
beholden
to
anyone
;
and
that
in
return
for
all
that
is
thrown
at
me
,
in
folly
or
vanity
,
as
I
go
along
,
I
can
throw
bubbles
back
.
<EOS>
If
I
do
n't
brood
over
all
I
want
,
it
is
the
better
for
me
,
and
not
the
worse
for
anyone
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
am
a
plaything
for
you
giants
,
be
gentle
with
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Mowcher
replaced
her
handkerchief
in
her
pocket
,
looking
at
me
with
very
intent
expression
all
the
while
,
and
pursued
:
   
"
<EOS>
I
saw
you
in
the
street
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
suppose
I
am
not
able
to
walk
as
fast
as
you
,
with
my
short
legs
and
short
breath
,
and
I
could
n't
overtake
you
;
but
I
guessed
where
you
came
,
and
came
after
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
here
before
,
today
,
but
the
good
woman
was
n't
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
her
?
<EOS>
"
I
demanded
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
of
her
,
and
about
her
,
"
she
replied
,
"
from
Omer
and
Joram
.
<EOS>
I
was
there
at
seven
o'clock
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
what
Steerforth
said
to
me
about
this
unfortunate
girl
,
that
time
when
I
saw
you
both
at
the
inn
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
great
bonnet
on
Miss
Mowcher
's
head
,
and
the
greater
bonnet
on
the
wall
,
began
to
go
backwards
and
forwards
again
when
she
asked
this
question
.
   
<EOS>
I
remembered
very
well
what
she
referred
to
,
having
had
it
in
my
thoughts
many
times
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
the
Father
of
all
Evil
confound
him
,
"
said
the
little
woman
,
holding
up
her
forefinger
between
me
and
her
sparkling
eyes
,
"
and
ten
times
more
confound
that
wicked
servant
;
but
I
believed
it
was
YOU
who
had
a
boyish
passion
for
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
.
   
<EOS>
"
Child
,
child
!
 
<EOS>
In
the
name
of
blind
ill
-
fortune
,
"
cried
Miss
Mowcher
,
wringing
her
hands
impatiently
,
as
she
went
to
and
fro
again
upon
the
fender
,
"
why
did
you
praise
her
so
,
and
blush
,
and
look
disturbed
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
conceal
from
myself
that
I
had
done
this
,
though
for
a
reason
very
different
from
her
supposition
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
I
know
?
"
said
Miss
Mowcher
,
taking
out
her
handkerchief
again
,
and
giving
one
little
stamp
on
the
ground
whenever
,
at
short
intervals
,
she
applied
it
to
her
eyes
with
both
hands
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
crossing
you
and
wheedling
you
,
I
saw
;
and
you
were
soft
wax
in
his
hands
,
I
saw
.
 
<EOS>
Had
I
left
the
room
a
minute
,
when
his
man
told
me
that
"
Young
Innocence
"
(
so
he
called
you
,
and
you
may
call
him
"
Old
Guilt
"
all
the
days
of
your
life
)
had
set
his
heart
upon
her
,
and
she
was
giddy
and
liked
him
,
but
his
master
was
resolved
that
no
harm
should
come
of
it
---
more
for
your
sake
than
for
hers
---
and
that
that
was
their
business
here
?
 
<EOS>
How
could
I
<EOS>
BUT
believe
him
?
<EOS>
I
saw
Steerforth
soothe
<EOS>
and
please
you
by
his
praise
of
her
!
 
<EOS>
You
were
the
first
to
mention
her
name
.
 
<EOS>
You
owned
to
an
old
admiration
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
hot
and
cold
,
and
red
and
white
,
all
at
once
when
I
spoke
to
you
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
What
could
I
think
---
what
DID
I
think
---
but
that
you
were
a
young
libertine
in
everything
but
experience
,
and
had
fallen
into
hands
that
had
experience
enough
,
and
could
manage
you
(
having
the
fancy
)
for
your
own
good
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
They
were
afraid
of
my
finding
out
the
truth
,
"
exclaimed
Miss
Mowcher
,
getting
off
the
fender
,
and
trotting
up
and
down
the
kitchen
with
her
two
short
arms
distressfully
lifted
up
,
"
because
I
am
a
sharp
little
thing
<EOS>
---
I
need
be
,
to
get
through
the
world
at
all
!
<EOS>
---
and
they
deceived
me
altogether
,
and
I
gave
the
poor
unfortunate
girl
a
letter
,
which
I
fully
believe
was
the
beginning
of
her
ever
speaking
to
Littimer
,
who
was
left
behind
on
purpose
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
stood
amazed
at
the
revelation
of
all
this
perfidy
,
looking
at
Miss
Mowcher
as
she
walked
up
and
down
the
kitchen
until
she
was
out
of
breath
:
when
she
sat
upon
the
fender
again
,
and
,
drying
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
,
shook
her
head
for
a
long
time
,
without
otherwise
moving
,
and
without
breaking
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
country
rounds
,
"
she
added
at
length
,
"
brought
me
to
Norwich
,
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
the
night
before
last
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
happened
to
find
there
,
about
their
secret
way
of
coming
and
going
,
without
you
---
which
was
strange
---
led
to
my
suspecting
something
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
into
the
coach
from
London
last
night
,
as
it
came
through
Norwich
,
and
was
here
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
oh
,
oh
!
too
late
!
"
   
<EOS>
Poor
little
Mowcher
turned
so
chilly
after
all
her
crying
and
fretting
,
that
she
turned
round
on
the
fender
,
putting
her
poor
little
wet
feet
in
among
the
ashes
to
warm
them
,
and
sat
looking
at
the
fire
,
like
a
large
doll
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
in
a
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
,
lost
in
unhappy
reflections
,
and
looking
at
the
fire
too
,
and
sometimes
at
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
,
"
she
said
at
last
,
rising
as
she
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
late
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
mistrust
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
Meeting
her
sharp
glance
,
which
was
as
sharp
as
ever
when
she
asked
me
,
<EOS>
I
could
not
on
that
short
challenge
answer
<EOS>
no
,
quite
frankly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
accepting
the
offer
of
my
hand
to
help
her
over
the
fender
,
and
looking
wistfully
up
into
my
face
,
"
you
know
you
would
n't
mistrust
me
,
if
I
was
a
full
-
sized
woman
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
felt
that
there
was
much
truth
in
this
;
and
I
felt
rather
ashamed
of
myself
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
young
man
,
"
she
said

nodding
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
a
word
of
advice
,
even
from
three
foot
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Try
not
to
associate
bodily
defects
with
mental
,
my
good
friend
,
except
for
a
solid
reason
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
had
got
over
the
fender
now
,
and
I
had
got
over
my
suspicion
.
<EOS>
I
told
her
that
I
believed
she
had
given
me
a
faithful
account
of
herself
,
and
that
we
had
both
been
hapless
instruments
in
designing
hands
.
 
<EOS>
She
thanked
me
,
and
said
I
was
a
good
fellow
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
mind
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
turning
back
on
her
way
to
the
door
,
and
looking
shrewdly
at
me
,
with
her
forefinger
up
again
.
<EOS>
---
"
I
have
some
reason
to
suspect
,
from
what
I
have
heard
---
my
ears
are
always
open
;
I
ca
n't
afford
to
spare
what
powers
I
have
---
that
they
are
gone
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
ever
they
return
,
if
ever
any
one
of
them
returns
,
while
I
am
alive
,
I
am
more
likely
than
another
,
going
about
as
I
do
,
to
find
it
out
soon
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
I
know
,
you
shall
know
.
 
<EOS>
If
ever
I
can
do
anything
to
serve
the
poor
betrayed
girl
,
I
will
do
it
faithfully
,
please
Heaven
!
 
<EOS>
And
Littimer
had
better
have
a
bloodhound
at
his
back
,
than
little
Mowcher
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
placed
implicit
faith
in
this
last
statement
,
when
I
marked
the
look
with
which
it
was
accompanied
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trust
me
no
more
,
but
trust
me
no
less
,
than
you
would
trust
a
full
-
sized
woman
,
"
said
the
little
creature
,
touching
me
appealingly
on
the
wrist
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
ever
you
see
me
again
,
unlike
what
I
am
now
,
and
like
what
I
was
when
you
first
saw
me
,
observe
what
company
I
am
in
.
 
<EOS>
Call
to
mind
that
I
am
a
very
helpless
and
defenceless
little
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Think
of
me
at
home
with
my
brother
like
myself
and
sister
like
myself
,
when
my
day
's
work
is
done
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
wo
n't
,
then
,
be
very
hard
upon
me
,
or
surprised
if
I
can
be
distressed
and
serious
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
gave
Miss
Mowcher
my
hand
,
with
a
very
different
opinion
of
her
from
that
which
I
had
hitherto
entertained
,
and
opened
the
door
to
let
her
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
trifling
business
to
get
the
great
umbrella
up
,
and
properly
balanced
in
her
grasp
;
but
at
last
I
successfully
accomplished
this
,
and
saw
it
go
bobbing
down
the
street
through
the
rain
,
without
the
least
appearance
of
having
anybody
underneath
it
,
except
when
a
heavier
fall
than
usual
from
some
over
-
charged
water
-
spout
sent
it
toppling
over
,
on
one
side
,
and
discovered
Miss
Mowcher
struggling
violently
to
get
it
right
.
<EOS>
After
making
one
or
two
sallies
to
her
relief
,
which
were
rendered
futile
by
the
umbrella
's
hopping
on
again
,
like
an
immense
bird
,
before
I
could
reach
it
,
I
came
in
,
went
to
bed
,
and
slept
till
morning
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
morning
I
was
joined
by
Mr
Peggotty
and
by
my
old
nurse
,
and
we
went
at
an
early
hour
to
the
coach
office
,
where
Mrs
Gummidge
and
Ham
were
waiting
to
take
leave
of
us
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
Ham
whispered
,
drawing
me
aside
,
while
Mr
Peggotty
was
stowing
his
bag
among
the
luggage
,
"
his
life
is
quite
broke
up
.
<EOS>
He
<EOS>
doen't
know
wheer
he
's
going
;
he
doen't
know
---
<EOS>
what
's
afore
him
;
he
's
bound
upon
a
voyage
that
'll
last
,
on
and
off
,
all
the
rest
of
his
days
,
take
my
wured
for
'
t
,
unless
he
finds
what
he
's
a
seeking
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
'll
be
a
friend
to
him
,
Mas'r
Davy
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Trust
me
,
I
will
indeed
,
"
said
I
,
shaking
hands
with
Ham
earnestly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thankee
.
 
<EOS>
Thankee
,
very
kind
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
One
thing
furder
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
in
good
employ
,
you
know
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
and
I
han't
no
way
now
of
spending
what
I
gets
.
 
<EOS>
Money
's
of
no
use
to
me
no
more
,
except
to
live
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
can
lay
it
out
for
him
,
I
shall
do
my
work
with
a
better
art
.
<EOS>
Though
as
to
that
,
sir
,
"
and
he
spoke
very
steadily
and
mildly
,
"
you
're
not
to
think
<EOS>
but
I
shall
work
at
all
times
,
like
a
man
,
and
act
the
best
that
lays
in
my
power
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
was
well
convinced
of
it
;
and
I
hinted
that
I
hoped
the
time
might
even
come
,
when
he
would
cease
to
lead
the
lonely
life
he
naturally
contemplated
now
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
all
that
's
past
and
over
with
me
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
can
never
fill
the
place
that
's
empty
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
'll
bear
in
mind
about
the
money
,
as
theer
's
at
all
times
some
laying
by
for
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
Reminding
him
of
the
fact
,
that
Mr
Peggotty
derived
a
steady
,
though
certainly
a
very
moderate
income
from
the
bequest
of
his
late
brother
-
in
-
law
,
I
promised
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
We
then
took
leave
of
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
leave
him
even
now
,
without
remembering
with
a
pang
,
at
once
his
modest
fortitude
and
his
great
sorrow
.
   
<EOS>
As
to
Mrs
Gummidge
,
if
I
were
to
endeavour
to
describe
how
she
ran
down
the
street
by
the
side
of
the
coach
,
seeing
nothing
<EOS>
but
Mr
Peggotty
on
the
roof
,
through
the
tears
she
tried
to
repress
,
and
dashing
herself
against
the
people
who
were
coming
in
the
opposite
direction
,
I
should
enter
on
a
task
of
some
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
had
better
leave
her
sitting
on
a
baker
's
door
-
step
,
out
of
breath
,
with
no
shape
at
all
remaining
in
her
bonnet
,
and
one
of
her
shoes
off
,
lying
on
the
pavement
at
a
considerable
distance
.
   
<EOS>
When
we
got
to
our
journey
's
end
,
our
first
pursuit
was
to
look
about
for
a
little
lodging
for
Peggotty
,
where
her
brother
could
have
a
bed
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
so
fortunate
as
to
find
one
,
of
a
very
clean
and
cheap
description
,
over
a
chandler
's
shop
,
only
two
streets
removed
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
had
engaged
this
domicile
,
I
bought
some
cold
meat
at
an
eating
-
house
,
and
took
my
fellow
-
travellers
home
to
tea
;
a
proceeding
,
I
regret
to
state
,
which
did
not
meet
with
Mrs
Crupp
's
approval
,
but
quite
the
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
observe
,
however
,
in
explanation
of
that
lady
's
state
of
mind
,
that
she
was
much
offended
by
<EOS>
Peggotty
's
tucking
up
her
widow
's
gown
before
she
had
been
ten
minutes
in
the
place
,
and
setting
to
work
to
dust
my
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
This
Mrs
Crupp
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
liberty
,
and
a
liberty
,
she
said
,
was
a
thing
she
never
allowed
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
had
made
a
communication
to
me
on
the
way
to
London
for
which
I
was
not
unprepared
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
,
that
he
purposed
first
seeing
Mrs
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
felt
bound
to
assist
him
in
this
,
and
also
to
mediate
between
them
;
with
the
view
of
sparing
the
mother
's
feelings
as
much
as
possible
,
I
wrote
to
her
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
as
mildly
as
I
could
what
his
wrong
was
,
and
what
my
own
share
in
his
injury
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
he
was
a
man
in
very
common
life
,
but
of
a
most
gentle
and
upright
character
;
and
that
I
ventured
to
express
a
hope
that
she
would
not
refuse
to
see
him
in
his
heavy
trouble
.
<EOS>
I
mentioned
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
as
the
hour
of
our
coming
,
and
I
sent
the
letter
myself
by
the
first
coach
in
the
morning
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
appointed
time
,
we
stood
at
the
door
---
the
door
of
that
house
where
I
had
been
,
a
few
days
since
,
so
happy
:
where
my
youthful
confidence
and
warmth
of
heart
had
been
yielded
up
so
freely
:
which
was
closed
against
me
henceforth
:
which
was
now
a
waste
,
a
ruin
.
   
<EOS>
No
Littimer
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
The
pleasanter
face
which
had
replaced
his
,
on
the
occasion
of
my
last
visit
,
answered
to
our
summons
,
and
went
before
us
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Steerforth
was
sitting
there
.
<EOS>
Rosa
Dartle
glided
,
as
we
went
in
,
from
another
part
of
the
room
and
stood
behind
her
chair
.
   
<EOS>
I
saw
,
directly
,
in
his
mother
's
face
,
that
she
knew
from
himself
what
he
had
done
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
pale
;
and
bore
the
traces
of
deeper
emotion
than
my
letter
alone
,
weakened
by
the
doubts
her
fondness
would
have
raised
upon
it
,
would
have
been
likely
to
create
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
her
more
like
him
than
ever
I
had
thought
her
;
and
I
felt
,
rather
than
saw
,
that
the
resemblance
was
not
lost
on
my
companion
.
   
<EOS>
She
sat
upright
in
her
arm
-
chair
,
with
a
stately
,
immovable
,
passionless
air
,
that
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
could
disturb
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
very
steadfastly
at
Mr
Peggotty
when
he
stood
before
her
;
and
he
looked
quite
as
steadfastly
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
Rosa
Dartle
's
keen
glance
comprehended
all
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
For
some
moments
not
a
word
was
spoken
.
   
<EOS>
She
motioned
to
Mr
Peggotty
to
be
seated
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
I
should
n't
feel
it
nat'ral
,
ma'am
,
to
sit
down
in
this
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
sooner
stand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
this
was
succeeded
by
another
silence
,
which
she
broke
thus
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
with
deep
regret
,
what
has
brought
you
here
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
want
of
me
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
ask
me
to
do
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
put
his
hat
under
his
arm
,
and
feeling
in
his
breast
for
Emily
's
letter
,
took
it
out
,
unfolded
it
,
and
gave
it
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
Please
to
read
that
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
my
niece
's
hand
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
read
it
,
in
the
same
stately
and
impassive
way
,
---
untouched
by
its
contents
,
as
far
as
I
could
see
,
---
and
returned
it
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Unless
he
brings
me
back
a
lady
,
"
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
tracing
out
that
part
with
his
finger
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
come
to
know
,
ma'am
,
whether
he
will
keep
his
wured
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
disgrace
himself
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
fail
to
know
that
she
is
far
below
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Raise
her
up
!
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
uneducated
and
ignorant
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Maybe
she
's
not
;
maybe
she
is
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
ma'am
;
but
I
'm
no
judge
of
them
things
.
 
<EOS>
Teach
her
better
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Since
you
oblige
me
to
speak
more
plainly
,
which
I
am
very
unwilling
to
do
,
her
humble
connexions
would
render
such
a
thing
impossible
,
if
nothing
else
did
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hark
to
this
,
ma'am
,
"
he
returned
,
slowly
and
quietly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
it
is
to
love
your
child
.
 
<EOS>
So
do
I.
 
<EOS>
If
she
was
a
hundred
times
my
child
,
I
could
n't
love
her
more
.
 
<EOS>
You
<EOS>
doen't
know
what
it
is
to
lose
your
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
heaps
of
riches
in
the
wureld
would
be
nowt
to
me
(
if
they
was
mine
)
to
buy
her
back
!
<EOS>
But
,
save
her
from
this
disgrace
,
and
she
shall
never
be
disgraced
by
us
.
 
<EOS>
Not
one
of
us
that
she
's
growed
up
among
,
not
one
of
us
that
's
lived
along
with
her
and
had
her
for
their
all
in
all
<EOS>
,
these
many
year
,
will
ever
look
upon
her
pritty
face
again
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
be
content
to
let
her
be
;
we
'll
be
content
to
think
of
her
,
far
off
,
as
if
she
was
underneath
another
sun
and
sky
;
we
'll
be
content
to
trust
her
to
her
husband
,
---
to
her
little
children
,
p'raps
,
---
and
bide
the
time
when
all
of
us
shall
be
alike
in
quality
afore
our
God
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
rugged
eloquence
with
which
he
spoke
,
was
not
devoid
of
all
effect
.
 
<EOS>
She
still
preserved
her
proud
manner
,
but
there
was
a
touch
of
softness
in
her
voice
,
as
she
answered
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
justify
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
no
counter
-
accusations
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
sorry
to
repeat
,
it
is
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
marriage
would
irretrievably
blight
my
son
's
career
,
and
ruin
his
prospects
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
is
more
certain
than
that
it
never
can
take
place
,
and
never
will
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
is
any
other
compensation
---
"
   
"
I
am
looking
at
the
likeness
of
the
face
,
"
interrupted
Mr
Peggotty
,
with
a
steady
but
a
kindling
eye
,
"
that
has
looked
at
me
,
in
my
home
,
at
my
fireside
,
in
my
boat
---
<EOS>
wheer
not
?
 
<EOS>
---
smiling
and
friendly
,
when
it
was
so
treacherous
<EOS>
,
that
I
go
half
wild
when
I
think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
likeness
of
that
face
do
n't
turn
to
burning
fire
,
at
the
thought
of
offering
money
to
me
for
my
child
's
blight
and
ruin
,
it
's
as
bad
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
doen't
know
,
being
a
lady
's
,
but
<EOS>
what
it
's
worse
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
changed
now
,
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
An
angry
flush
overspread
her
features
;
and
she
said
,
in
an
intolerant
manner
,
grasping
the
arm
-
chair
tightly
with
her
hands
:
   
<EOS>
"
What
compensation
can
you
make
to
ME
for
opening
such
a
pit
between
me
and
my
son
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
your
love
to
mine
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
your
separation
to
ours
?
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Dartle
softly
touched
her
,
and
bent
down
her
head
to
whisper
,
but
she
would
not
hear
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Rosa
,
not
a
word
!
 
<EOS>
Let
the
man
listen
to
what
I
say
!
 
<EOS>
My
son
,
who
has
been
the
object
of
my
life
,
to
whom
its
every
thought
has
been
devoted
,
whom
I
have
gratified
from
a
child
in
every
wish
,
from
whom
I
have
had
no
separate
existence
since
his
birth
,
---
to
take
up
in
a
moment
with
a
miserable
girl
,
and
avoid
me
!
 
<EOS>
To
repay
my
confidence
with
systematic
deception
,
for
her
sake
,
and
quit
me
for
her
!
 
<EOS>
To
set
this
wretched
fancy
,
against
his
mother
's
claims
upon
his
duty
,
love
,
respect
,
gratitude
<EOS>
---
claims
that
every
day
and
hour
of
his
life
should
have
strengthened
into
ties
that
nothing
could
be
proof
against
!
 
<EOS>
Is
this
no
injury
?
"
   
<EOS>
Again
Rosa
Dartle
tried
to
soothe
her
;
again
ineffectually
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Rosa
,
not
a
word
!
 
<EOS>
If
he
can
stake
his
all
upon
the
lightest
object
,
I
can
stake
my
all
upon
a
greater
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
go
where
he
will
,
with
the
means
that
my
love
has
secured
to
him
!
 
<EOS>
Does
he
think
to
reduce
me
by
long
absence
?
 
<EOS>
He
knows
his
mother
very
little
if
he
does
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
put
away
his
whim
now
,
and
he
is
welcome
back
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
not
put
her
away
now
,
and
he
never
shall
come
near
me
,
living
or
dying
,
while
I
can
raise
my
hand
to
make
a
sign
against
it
,
unless
,
being
rid
of
her
for
ever
,
he
comes
humbly
to
me
and
begs
for
my
forgiveness
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
my
right
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
acknowledgement
I
WILL
HAVE
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
separation
that
there
is
between
us
!
 
<EOS>
And
is
this
,
"
she
added
,
looking
at
her
visitor
with
the
proud
intolerant
air
with
which
she
had
begun
,
"
no
injury
?
"
   
<EOS>
While
I
heard
and
saw
the
mother
as
she
said
these
words
,
I
seemed
to
hear
and
see
the
son
,
defying
them
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
I
had
ever
seen
in
him
of
an
unyielding
,
wilful
spirit
,
I
saw
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
understanding
that
I
had
now
of
his
misdirected
energy
,
became
an
understanding
of
her
character
too
,
and
a
perception
that
it
was
,
in
its
strongest
springs
,
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
She
now
observed
to
me
,
aloud
,
resuming
her
former
restraint
,
that
it
was
useless
to
hear
more
,
or
to
say
more
,
and
that
she
begged
to
put
an
end
to
the
interview
.
 
<EOS>
She
rose
with
an
air
of
dignity
to
leave
the
room
,
when
Mr
Peggotty
signified
that
it
was
needless
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Doen't
fear
me
being
any
hindrance
to
you
,
I
have
no
more
to
say
,
ma'am
,
"
he
remarked
,
as
he
moved
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
come
beer
with
no
hope
,
and
I
take
away
no
hope
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
done
what
I
thowt
should
be
done
,
but
I
never
looked
fur
any
good
to
come
of
my
stan'ning
where
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
This
has
been
too
evil
<EOS>
a
house
fur
me
and
mine
<EOS>
,
fur
me
to
be
in
my
right
senses
and
expect
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
,
we
departed
;
leaving
her
standing
by
her
elbow
-
chair
,
a
picture
of
a
noble
presence
and
a
handsome
face
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
,
on
our
way
out
,
to
cross
a
paved
hall
,
with
glass
sides
and
roof
,
over
which
a
vine
was
trained
.
 
<EOS>
Its
leaves
and
shoots
were
green
then
,
and
the
day
being
sunny
,
a
pair
of
glass
doors
leading
to
the
garden
were
thrown
open
.
 
<EOS>
Rosa
Dartle
,
entering
this
way
with
a
noiseless
step
<EOS>
,
when
we
were
close
to
them
,
addressed
herself
to
me
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
well
,
"
she
said
,
"
indeed
,
to
bring
this
fellow
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
Such
a
concentration
of
rage
and
scorn
as
darkened
her
face
,
and
flashed
in
her
jet
-
black
eyes
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
have
thought
compressible
even
into
that
face
.
 
<EOS>
The
scar
made
by
the
hammer
was
,
as
usual
in
this
excited
state
of
her
features
,
strongly
marked
.
<EOS>
When
the
throbbing
I
had
seen
before
,
came
into
it
as
I
looked
at
her
,
she
absolutely
lifted
up
her
hand
,
and
struck
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
fellow
,
"
she
said
,
"
to
champion
and
bring
here
,
is
he
not
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
true
man
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dartle
,
"
I
returned
,
"
you
are
surely
not
so
unjust
as
to
condemn
ME
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
bring
division
between
these
two
mad
creatures
?
<EOS>
"
she
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
know
that
they
are
both
mad
with
their
own
self
-
will
and
pride
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
my
doing
?
<EOS>
"
I
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
your
doing
!
"
<EOS>
she
retorted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
bring
this
man
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
deeply
-
injured
man
,
Miss
Dartle
,
"
I
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
not
know
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
James
Steerforth
,
"
she
said
,
with
her
hand
on
her
bosom
,
as
if
to
prevent
the
storm
that
was
raging
there
,
from
being
loud
,
"
has
a
false
,
corrupt
heart
,
and
is
a
traitor
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
need
I
know
or
care
about
this
fellow
,
and
his
common
niece
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dartle
,
"
I
returned
,
"
you
deepen
the
injury
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
sufficient
already
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
only
say
,
at
parting
,
that
you
do
him
a
great
wrong
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
him
no
wrong
,
"
she
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
a
depraved
,
worthless
set
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
her
whipped
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
passed
on
,
without
a
word
,
and
went
out
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
shame
,
Miss
Dartle
!
<EOS>
shame
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
indignantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
bear
to
trample
on
his
undeserved
affliction
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
trample
on
them
all
,
"
she
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
his
house
pulled
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
her
branded
on
the
face
,
dressed
in
rags
,
and
cast
out
in
the
streets
to
starve
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
the
power
to
sit
in
judgement
on
her
,
I
would
see
it
done
.
 
<EOS>
See
it
done
?
 
<EOS>
I
would
do
it
!
 
<EOS>
I
detest
her
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
ever
could
reproach
her
with
her
infamous
condition
,
I
would
go
anywhere
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
could
hunt
her
to
her
grave
,
I
would
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
was
any
word
of
comfort
that
would
be
a
solace
to
her
in
her
dying
hour
,
and
only
I
possessed
it
,
I
would
n't
part
with
it
for
Life
itself
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
mere
vehemence
of
her
words
can
convey
,
I
am
sensible
,
but
a
weak
impression
of
the
passion
by
which
she
was
possessed
,
and
which
made
itself
articulate
in
her
whole
figure
,
though
her
voice
,
instead
of
being
raised
,
was
lower
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
No
description
I
could
give
of
her
would
do
justice
to
my
recollection
of
her
,
or
to
her
entire
deliverance
of
herself
to
her
anger
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
passion
in
many
forms
,
but
I
have
never
seen
it
in
such
a
form
as
that
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
joined
Mr
Peggotty
,
he
was
walking
slowly
and
thoughtfully
down
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
,
as
soon
as
I
came
up
with
him
,
that
having
now
discharged
his
mind
of
what
he
had
purposed
doing
in
London
,
he
meant
"
to
set
out
on
his
travels
"
,
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
him
where
he
meant
to
go
?
 
<EOS>
He
only
answered
,
"
I
'm
a
going
,
sir
,
to
seek
my
niece
.
"
   
<EOS>
We
went
back
to
the
little
lodging
over
the
chandler
's
shop
,
and
there
I
found
an
opportunity
of
repeating
to
Peggotty
what
he
had
said
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
informed
me
,
in
return
,
that
he
had
said
the
same
to
her
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
no
more
than
I
did
,
where
he
was
going
,
but
she
thought
he
had
some
project
shaped
out
in
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
I
did
not
like
to
leave
him
,
under
such
circumstances
,
and
we
all
three
dined
together
off
a
beefsteak
pie
---
which
was
one
of
the
many
good
things
for
which
Peggotty
was
famous
---
and
which
was
curiously
flavoured
on
this
occasion
<EOS>
,
I
recollect
well
,
by
a
miscellaneous
taste
of
tea
,
coffee
,
butter
,
bacon
,
cheese
,
new
loaves
,
firewood
,
candles
,
and
walnut
ketchup
,
continually
ascending
from
the
shop
.
 
<EOS>
After
dinner
we
sat
for
an
hour
or
so
near
the
window
,
without
talking
much
;
and
then
Mr
Peggotty
got
up
,
and
brought
his
oilskin
bag
and
his
stout
stick
,
and
laid
them
on
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
He
accepted
,
from
his
sister
's
stock
of
ready
money
,
a
small
sum
on
account
of
his
legacy
;
barely
enough
,
I
should
have
thought
,
to
keep
him
for
a
month
.
 
<EOS>
He
promised
to
communicate
with
me
,
when
anything
befell
him
;
and
he
slung
his
bag
about
him
,
took
his
hat
and
stick
,
and
bade
us
both
"
Good
-
bye
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
good
attend
you
,
dear
old
woman
,
"
he
said
,
embracing
Peggotty
,
"
<EOS>
and
you
too
,
Mas'r
Davy
!
<EOS>
"
shaking
hands
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
-
going
to
seek
her
,
fur
and
wide
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
should
come
home
while
I
'm
away
---
<EOS>
but
ah
,
that
ai
n't
like
to
be
!
<EOS>
---
or
if
I
should
bring
her
back
,
my
meaning
is
,
that
she
and
me
shall
live
and
die
where
no
one
ca
n't
reproach
her
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
hurt
should
come
to
me
,
remember
that
the
last
words
I
left
for
her
was
,
"
My
unchanged
love
is
with
my
darling
child
,
and
I
forgive
her
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
said
this
solemnly
,
bare
-
headed
;
then
,
putting
on
his
hat
,
he
went
down
the
stairs
,
and
away
.
 
<EOS>
We
followed
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
warm
,
dusty
evening
,
just
the
time
when
,
in
the
great
main
thoroughfare
out
of
which
that
by
-
way
turned
,
there
was
a
temporary
lull
in
the
eternal
tread
of
feet
upon
the
pavement
,
and
a
strong
red
sunshine
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
,
alone
,
at
the
corner
of
our
shady
street
,
into
a
glow
of
light
,
in
which
we
lost
him
.
   
<EOS>
Rarely
did
that
hour
of
the
evening
come
,
rarely
did
I
wake
at
night
,
rarely
did
I
look
up
at
the
moon
,
or
stars
,
or
watch
the
falling
rain
,
or
hear
the
wind
,
but
I
thought
of
his
solitary
figure
toiling
on
,
poor
pilgrim
,
and
recalled
the
words
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
going
to
seek
her
,
fur
and
wide
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
hurt
should
come
to
me
,
remember
that
the
last
words
I
left
for
her
was
,
"
My
unchanged
love
is
with
my
darling
child
,
and
I
forgive
her
!

Chapter
33
.
<EOS>
Blissful
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
I
had
gone
on
loving
Dora
,
harder
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
Her
idea
was
my
refuge
in
disappointment
and
distress
,
and
made
some
amends
to
me
,
even
for
the
loss
of
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
I
pitied
myself
,
or
pitied
others
,
the
more
I
sought
for
consolation
in
the
image
of
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
The
greater
the
accumulation
of
deceit
and
trouble
in
the
world
,
<EOS>
the
brighter
and
the
purer
shone
the
star
of
Dora
high
above
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
had
any
definite
idea
where
Dora
came
from
,
or
in
what
degree
she
was
related
to
a
higher
order
of
beings
;
but
I
am
quite
sure
I
should
have
scouted
the
notion
of
her
being
simply
human
,
like
any
other
young
lady
,
with
indignation
and
contempt
.
   
<EOS>
If
I
may
so
express
it
,
I
was
steeped
in
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
merely
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
her
,
but
I
was
saturated
through
and
through
.
 
<EOS>
Enough
love
might
have
been
wrung
out
of
me
,
metaphorically
speaking
,
to
drown
anybody
in
;
and
yet
there
would
have
remained
enough
within
me
,
and
all
over
me
,
to
pervade
my
entire
existence
.
   
<EOS>
The
first
thing
I
did
,
on
my
own
account
,
when
I
came
back
,
was
to
take
a
night
-
walk
to
Norwood
,
and
,
like
the
subject
of
a
venerable
riddle
of
my
childhood
,
to
go
"
round
and
round
the
house
,
without
ever
touching
the
house
"
,
thinking
about
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
the
theme
of
this
incomprehensible
conundrum
was
the
moon
.
 
<EOS>
No
matter
what
it
was
,
I
,
the
moon
-
struck
slave
of
Dora
,
perambulated
round
and
round
the
house
and
garden
for
two
hours
,
looking
through
crevices
in
the
palings
,
getting
my
chin
by
dint
of
violent
exertion
above
the
rusty
nails
on
the
top
,
blowing
kisses
at
the
lights
in
the
windows
,
and
romantically
calling
on
the
night
,
at
intervals
,
to
shield
my
Dora
<EOS>
---
I
do
n't
exactly
know
what
from
,
I
suppose
from
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
from
mice
,
to
which
she
had
a
great
objection
.
   
<EOS>
My
love
was
so
much
in
my
mind
<EOS>
and
it
was
so
natural
to
me
to
confide
in
Peggotty
,
when
I
found
her
again
by
my
side
of
an
evening
with
the
old
set
of
industrial
implements
,
busily
making
the
tour
of
my
wardrobe
,
that
I
imparted
to
her
,
in
a
sufficiently
roundabout
way
,
<EOS>
my
great
secret
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
was
strongly
interested
,
but
I
could
not
get
her
into
my
view
of
the
case
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
audaciously
prejudiced
in
my
favour
,
and
quite
unable
to
understand
why
I
should
have
any
misgivings
,
or
be
low
-
spirited
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
The
young
lady
might
think
herself
well
off
,
"
she
observed
,
"
to
have
such
a
beau
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
to
her
Pa
,
"
she
said
,
"
what
did
the
gentleman
expect
,
for
gracious
sake
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
observed
,
however
,
that
Mr
Spenlow
's
proctorial
gown
and
stiff
cravat
took
Peggotty
down
a
little
,
and
inspired
her
with
a
greater
reverence
for
the
man
who
was
gradually
becoming
more
and
more
etherealized
in
my
eyes
every
day
,
and
about
whom
a
reflected
radiance
seemed
to
me
to
beam
when
he
sat
erect
in
Court
among
his
papers
,
like
a
little
lighthouse
in
a
sea
of
stationery
.
 
<EOS>
And
by
the
by
,
it
used
to
be
uncommonly
strange
to
me
to
consider
,
I
remember
,
as
I
sat
in
Court
too
,
how
those
dim
old
judges
and
doctors
would
n't
have
cared
for
Dora
,
if
they
had
known
her
;
how
they
would
n't
have
gone
out
of
their
senses
with
rapture
,
if
marriage
with
Dora
had
been
proposed
to
them
;
how
Dora
might
have
sung
,
and
played
upon
that
glorified
guitar
,
until
she
led
me
to
the
verge
of
madness
,
yet
not
have
tempted
one
of
those
slow
-
goers
an
inch
out
of
his
road
!
   
<EOS>
I
despised
them
,
to
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
Frozen
-
out
old
gardeners
in
the
flower
-
beds
of
the
heart
<EOS>
,
I
took
a
personal
offence
against
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bench
was
nothing
to
me
but
an
insensible
blunderer
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bar
had
no
more
tenderness
or
poetry
in
it
,
than
the
bar
of
a
public
-
house
.
   
<EOS>
Taking
the
management
of
Peggotty
's
affairs
into
my
own
hands
,
with
no
little
pride
,
I
proved
the
will
,
and
came
to
a
settlement
with
the
Legacy
Duty
-
office
,
and
took
her
to
the
Bank
,
and
soon
got
everything
into
an
orderly
train
.
 
<EOS>
We
varied
the
legal
character
of
these
proceedings
by
going
to
see
some
perspiring
Wax
-
work
,
in
Fleet
Street
(
melted
,
I
should
hope
,
these
twenty
years
)
;
and
by
visiting
Miss
Linwood
's
Exhibition
,
which
I
remember
as
a
Mausoleum
of
needlework
,
favourable
to
self
-
examination
and
repentance
;
and
by
inspecting
the
Tower
of
London
;
and
going
to
the
top
of
St
Paul
's
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
wonders
afforded
Peggotty
as
much
pleasure
as
she
was
able
to
enjoy
,
under
existing
circumstances
:
except
,
I
think
,
St
Paul
's
,
which
,
from
her
long
attachment
to
her
work
-
box
,
became
a
rival
of
the
picture
on
the
lid
,
and
was
,
in
some
particulars
,
vanquished
<EOS>
,
she
considered
,
by
that
work
of
art
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
's
business
,
which
was
what
we
used
to
call
"
common
-
form
business
"
in
the
Commons
(
and
very
light
and
lucrative
the
common
-
form
business
was
)
,
being
settled
,
I
took
her
down
to
the
office
one
morning
to
pay
her
bill
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
had
stepped
out
,
old
Tiffey
said
,
to
get
a
gentleman
sworn
for
a
marriage
licence
;
but
as
I
knew
he
would
be
back
directly
,
<EOS>
our
place
lying
close
to
the
Surrogate
's
,
and
to
the
Vicar
-
General
's
office
too
<EOS>
,
I
told
Peggotty
to
wait
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
a
little
like
undertakers
,
in
the
Commons
,
as
regarded
Probate
transactions
;
generally
making
it
a
rule
to
look
more
or
less
cut
up
,
when
we
had
to
deal
with
clients
in
mourning
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
similar
feeling
of
delicacy
,
we
were
always
blithe
and
light
-
hearted
with
the
licence
clients
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
hinted
to
Peggotty
that
she
would
find
Mr
Spenlow
much
recovered
from
the
shock
of
Mr
Barkis
's
decease
;
and
indeed
he
came
in
like
a
bridegroom
.
   
<EOS>
But
neither
Peggotty
nor
I
had
eyes
for
him
,
when
we
saw
,
in
company
with
him
,
Mr
Murdstone
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
little
changed
.
 
<EOS>
His
hair
looked
as
thick
,
and
was
certainly
as
black
,
as
ever
;
and
his
glance
was
as
little
to
be
trusted
as
of
old
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Copperfield
?
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
this
gentleman
,
I
believe
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
made
my
gentleman
a
distant
bow
,
and
Peggotty
barely
recognized
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
,
at
first
,
somewhat
disconcerted
to
meet
us
two
together
;
but
quickly
decided
what
to
do
,
and
came
up
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
you
are
doing
well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
can
hardly
be
interesting
to
you
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
if
you
wish
to
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
We
looked
at
each
other
,
and
he
addressed
himself
to
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
,
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
observe
that
you
have
lost
your
husband
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
the
first
loss
I
have
had
in
my
life
,
Mr
Murdstone
,
"
replied
Peggotty
,
trembling
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hope
that
there
is
nobody
to
blame
for
this
one
,
---
nobody
to
answer
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
;
"
that
's
a
comfortable
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
done
your
duty
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
worn
anybody
's
life
away
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
"
I
am
thankful
to
think
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
Mr
Murdstone
,
I
have
not
worrited
and
frightened
any
sweet
creetur
to
an
early
grave
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
eyed
her
gloomily
---
remorsefully
I
thought
---
for
an
instant
;
and
said
,
turning
his
head
towards
me
,
but
looking
at
my
feet
instead
of
my
face
:
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
not
likely
to
encounter
soon
again
;
---
a
source
of
satisfaction
to
us
both
,
no
doubt
,
for
such
meetings
as
this
can
never
be
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
expect
that
you
,
who
always
rebelled
against
my
just
authority
,
exerted
for
your
benefit
and
reformation
,
should
owe
me
any
good
-
will
now
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
an
antipathy
between
us
---
"
   
"
An
old
one
,
I
believe
?
"
said
I
,
interrupting
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
smiled
,
and
shot
as
evil
a
glance
at
me
as
could
come
from
his
dark
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
rankled
in
your
baby
breast
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
embittered
the
life
of
your
poor
mother
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
may
do
better
,
yet
;
I
hope
you
may
correct
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
he
ended
the
dialogue
,
which
had
been
carried
on
in
a
low
voice
,
in
a
corner
of
the
outer
office
,
by
passing
into
Mr
Spenlow
's
room
,
and
saying
aloud
,
in
his
smoothest
manner
:
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
of
Mr
Spenlow
's
profession
are
accustomed
to
family
differences
,
and
know
how
complicated
and
difficult
they
always
are
!
"
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
paid
the
money
for
his
licence
;
and
,
receiving
it
neatly
folded
from
Mr
Spenlow
,
together
with
a
shake
of
the
hand
,
and
a
polite
wish
for
his
happiness
and
the
lady
's
,
went
out
of
the
office
.
   
<EOS>
I
might
have
had
more
difficulty
in
constraining
myself
to
be
silent
under
his
words
,
if
I
had
had
less
difficulty
in
impressing
upon
Peggotty
(
who
was
only
angry
on
my
account
,
good
creature
!
)
<EOS>
that
we
were
not
in
a
place
for
recrimination
,
and
that
I
besought
her
to
hold
her
peace
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
so
unusually
roused
,
that
I
was
glad
to
compound
for
an
affectionate
hug
,
elicited
by
this
revival
in
her
mind
of
our
old
injuries
,
and
to
make
the
best
I
could
of
it
,
before
Mr
Spenlow
and
the
clerks
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
did
not
appear
to
know
what
the
connexion
between
Mr
Murdstone
and
myself
was
;
which
I
was
glad
of
,
for
I
could
not
bear
to
acknowledge
him
,
even
in
my
own
breast
,
remembering
what
I
did
of
the
history
of
my
poor
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
seemed
to
think
,
if
he
thought
anything
about
the
matter
,
that
my
aunt
was
the
leader
of
the
state
party
in
our
family
,
and
that
there
was
a
rebel
party
commanded
by
somebody
else
---
so
I
gathered
at
least
from
what
he
said
,
while
we
were
waiting
for
Mr
Tiffey
to
make
out
Peggotty
's
bill
of
costs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Trotwood
,
"
he
remarked
,
"
is
very
firm
,
no
doubt
,
and
not
likely
to
give
way
to
opposition
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
an
admiration
for
her
character
,
and
I
may
congratulate
you
,
Copperfield
,
on
being
on
the
right
side
.
 
<EOS>
Differences
between
relations
are
much
to
be
deplored
---
but
they
are
extremely
general
---
and
the
great
thing
is
,
to
be
on
the
right
side
"
:
<EOS>
meaning
<EOS>
,
I
take
it
,
on
the
side
of
the
moneyed
interest
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rather
a
good
marriage
this
<EOS>
,
I
believe
?
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
.
   
<EOS>
I
explained
that
I
knew
nothing
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Speaking
from
the
few
words
Mr
Murdstone
dropped
---
as
a
man
frequently
does
on
these
occasions
---
and
from
what
Miss
Murdstone
let
fall
,
I
should
say
it
was
rather
a
good
marriage
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
that
there
is
money
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
,
"
I
understand
there
's
money
.
 
<EOS>
Beauty
too
,
I
am
told
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
 
<EOS>
Is
his
new
wife
young
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
of
age
,
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
lately
,
that
I
should
think
they
had
been
waiting
for
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
deliver
her
!
"
said
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
So
very
emphatically
and
unexpectedly
,
that
we
were
all
three
discomposed
;
until
Tiffey
came
in
with
the
bill
.
   
<EOS>
Old
Tiffey
soon
appeared
,
however
,
and
handed
it
to
Mr
Spenlow
,
to
look
over
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
,
settling
his
chin
in
his
cravat
and
rubbing
it
softly
,
went
over
the
items
with
a
deprecatory
air
---
as
if
it
were
all
Jorkins
's
doing
---
and
handed
it
back
to
Tiffey
with
a
bland
sigh
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
extremely
happy
,
<EOS>
Copperfield
,
to
have
limited
these
charges
to
the
actual
expenditure
out
of
pocket
,
but
it
is
an
irksome
incident
in
my
professional
life
,
that
I
am
not
at
liberty
to
consult
my
own
wishes
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
partner
---
Mr
Jorkins
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
with
a
gentle
melancholy
,
which
was
the
next
thing
to
making
no
charge
at
all
,
I
expressed
my
acknowledgements
on
Peggotty
's
behalf
,
and
paid
Tiffey
in
banknotes
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
then
retired
to
her
lodging
,
and
Mr
Spenlow
<EOS>
and
I
went
into
Court
,
where
we
had
a
divorce
-
suit
coming
on
,
under
an
ingenious
little
statute
(
repealed
now
,
I
believe
,
but
in
virtue
of
which
I
have
seen
several
marriages
annulled
)
,
of
which
the
merits
were
these
.
<EOS>
The
husband
,
whose
name
was
Thomas
Benjamin
,
had
taken
out
his
marriage
licence
as
Thomas
only
;
suppressing
the
Benjamin
,
in
case
he
should
not
find
himself
as
comfortable
as
he
expected
.
 
<EOS>
NOT
finding
himself
as
comfortable
as
he
expected
,
or
being
a
little
fatigued
with
his
wife
,
poor
fellow
,
he
now
came
forward
,
by
a
friend
,
after
being
married
a
year
or
two
,
and
declared
that
his
name
was
Thomas
Benjamin
,
and
therefore
he
was
not
married
at
all
.
<EOS>
Which
the
Court
confirmed
,
to
his
great
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
I
must
say
that
I
had
my
doubts
about
the
strict
justice
of
this
,
and
was
not
even
frightened
out
of
them
by
the
bushel
of
wheat
which
reconciles
all
anomalies
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Spenlow
argued
the
matter
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
Look
at
the
world
,
there
was
good
and
evil
in
that
;
look
at
the
ecclesiastical
law
,
there
was
good
and
evil
in
THAT
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
all
part
of
a
system
.
 
<EOS>
Very
good
.
 
<EOS>
There
you
were
!
   
<EOS>
I
had
not
the
hardihood
to
suggest
to
Dora
's
father
that
possibly
we
might
even
improve
the
world
a
little
,
if
we
got
up
early
in
the
morning
,
and
took
off
our
coats
to
the
work
;
but
I
confessed
that
I
thought
we
might
improve
the
Commons
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
replied
that
he
would
particularly
advise
me
to
dismiss
that
idea
from
my
mind
,
as
not
being
worthy
of
my
gentlemanly
character
;
but
that
he
would
be
glad
to
hear
from
me
of
what
improvement
<EOS>
I
thought
the
Commons
susceptible
?
   
<EOS>
Taking
that
part
of
the
Commons
which
happened
to
be
nearest
to
us
---
for
our
man
was
unmarried
by
this
time
,
and
we
were
out
of
Court
,
and
strolling
past
the
Prerogative
Office
<EOS>
---
I
submitted
that
I
thought
the
Prerogative
Office
rather
a
queerly
managed
institution
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
inquired
in
what
respect
?
 
<EOS>
I
replied
,
with
all
due
deference
to
his
experience
(
but
with
more
deference
,
I
am
afraid
,
to
his
being
Dora
's
father
)
,
that
perhaps
it
was
a
little
nonsensical
that
the
Registry
of
that
Court
,
containing
the
original
wills
of
all
persons
leaving
effects
within
the
immense
province
of
Canterbury
,
for
three
whole
centuries
<EOS>
,
should
be
an
accidental
building
,
never
designed
for
the
purpose
,
leased
by
the
registrars
for
their
Own
private
emolument
,
unsafe
,
not
even
ascertained
to
be
fire
-
proof
,
choked
with
the
important
documents
it
held
,
and
positively
,
from
the
roof
to
the
basement
,
a
mercenary
speculation
of
the
registrars
,
who
took
great
fees
from
the
public
,
and
crammed
the
public
's
wills
away
anyhow
and
anywhere
,
having
no
other
object
than
to
get
rid
of
them
cheaply
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
perhaps
,
it
was
a
little
unreasonable
that
these
registrars
in
the
receipt
of
profits
amounting
to
eight
or
nine
thousand
pounds
a
year
(
to
say
nothing
of
the
profits
of
the
deputy
registrars
,
and
clerks
of
seats
)
,
should
not
be
obliged
to
spend
a
little
of
that
money
,
in
finding
a
reasonably
safe
place
for
the
important
documents
which
all
classes
of
people
were
compelled
to
hand
over
to
them
,
whether
they
would
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
perhaps
,
it
was
a
little
unjust
,
that
all
the
great
offices
in
this
great
office
should
be
magnificent
sinecures
,
while
the
unfortunate
working
-
clerks
in
the
cold
dark
room
upstairs
were
the
worst
rewarded
,
and
the
least
considered
men
,
doing
important
services
,
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
That
perhaps
it
was
a
little
indecent
that
the
principal
registrar
of
all
,
whose
duty
it
was
to
find
the
public
,
constantly
resorting
to
this
place
,
all
needful
accommodation
,
should
be
an
enormous
sinecurist
in
virtue
of
that
post
(
and
might
be
,
besides
,
a
clergyman
,
a
pluralist
,
the
holder
of
a
staff
in
a
cathedral
,
and
what
not
)
,
---
while
the
public
was
put
to
the
inconvenience
of
which
we
had
a
specimen
every
afternoon
when
the
office
was
busy
,
and
which
we
knew
to
be
quite
monstrous
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
perhaps
,
in
short
,
this
Prerogative
Office
of
the
diocese
of
Canterbury
was
altogether
such
a
pestilent
job
,
and
such
a
pernicious
absurdity
,
that
but
for
its
being
squeezed
away
in
a
corner
of
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
which
few
people
knew
,
it
must
have
been
turned
completely
inside
out
,
and
upside
down
,
long
ago
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
smiled
as
I
became
modestly
warm
on
the
subject
,
and
then
argued
this
question
with
me
as
he
had
argued
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
what
was
it
after
all
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
question
of
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
public
felt
that
their
wills
were
in
safe
keeping
,
and
took
it
for
granted
that
the
office
was
not
to
be
made
better
,
<EOS>
who
was
the
worse
for
it
?
 
<EOS>
Nobody
.
 
<EOS>
Who
was
the
better
for
it
?
 
<EOS>
All
the
Sinecurists
.
 
<EOS>
Very
well
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
good
predominated
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
not
be
a
perfect
system
;
nothing
was
perfect
;
but
what
he
objected
to
,
was
,
the
insertion
of
the
wedge
.
 
<EOS>
Under
the
Prerogative
Office
,
the
country
had
been
glorious
.
 
<EOS>
Insert
the
wedge
into
the
Prerogative
Office
,
and
the
country
would
cease
to
be
glorious
.
 
<EOS>
He
considered
it
the
principle
of
a
gentleman
to
take
things
as
he
found
them
;
and
he
had
no
doubt
the
Prerogative
Office
would
last
our
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
deferred
to
his
opinion
,
though
I
had
great
doubts
of
it
myself
.
<EOS>
I
find
he
was
right
,
however
;
for
it
has
not
only
lasted
to
the
present
moment
,
but
has
done
so
in
the
teeth
of
a
great
parliamentary
report
made
(
not
too
willingly
)
eighteen
years
ago
,
when
all
these
objections
of
mine
were
set
forth
in
detail
,
and
when
the
existing
stowage
for
wills
was
described
as
equal
to
the
accumulation
of
only
two
years
and
a
half
more
.
 
<EOS>
What
they
have
done
with
them
since
;
whether
they
have
lost
many
,
or
whether
they
sell
any
,
now
and
then
,
to
the
butter
shops
;
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
mine
is
not
there
,
and
I
hope
it
may
not
go
there
,
yet
awhile
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
set
all
this
down
,
in
my
present
blissful
chapter
,
because
here
it
comes
into
its
natural
place
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
and
<EOS>
I
falling
into
this
conversation
,
prolonged
it
and
our
saunter
to
and
fro
,
until
we
diverged
into
general
topics
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
it
came
about
<EOS>
,
in
the
end
,
that
Mr
Spenlow
told
me
this
day
week
was
Dora
's
birthday
,
and
he
would
be
glad
if
I
would
come
down
and
join
a
little
picnic
on
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
out
of
my
senses
immediately
;
became
a
mere
driveller
next
day
,
on
receipt
of
a
little
lace
-
edged
sheet
of
note
-
paper
,
"
Favoured
by
papa
.
 
<EOS>
To
remind
"
;
and
passed
the
intervening
period
in
a
state
of
dotage
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
I
committed
every
possible
absurdity
in
the
way
of
preparation
for
this
blessed
event
.
 
<EOS>
I
turn
hot
when
I
remember
the
cravat
I
bought
.
 
<EOS>
My
boots
might
be
placed
in
any
collection
of
instruments
of
torture
.
 
<EOS>
I
provided
,
and
sent
down
by
the
Norwood
coach
the
night
before
,
a
delicate
little
hamper
,
amounting
in
itself
,
I
thought
,
almost
to
a
declaration
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
crackers
in
it
with
the
tenderest
mottoes
that
could
be
got
for
money
.
 
<EOS>
At
six
in
the
morning
,
I
was
in
Covent
Garden
Market
,
buying
a
bouquet
for
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
At
ten
I
was
on
horseback
<EOS>
(
I
hired
a
gallant
grey
,
for
the
occasion
)
,
with
the
bouquet
in
my
hat
,
to
keep
it
fresh
,
trotting
down
to
Norwood
.
   
<EOS>
I
suppose
that
when
I
saw
Dora
in
the
garden
and
pretended
not
to
see
her
,
and
rode
past
the
house
pretending
to
be
anxiously
looking
for
it
,
I
committed
two
small
fooleries
which
other
young
gentlemen
in
my
circumstances
might
have
committed
---
because
they
came
so
very
natural
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
when
I
DID
find
the
house
,
and
DID
dismount
at
the
garden
-
gate
,
and
drag
those
stony
-
hearted
boots
across
the
lawn
to
Dora
sitting
on
a
garden
-
seat
under
a
lilac
tree
,
what
a
spectacle
she
was
,
upon
that
beautiful
morning
,
among
the
butterflies
,
in
a
white
chip
bonnet
and
a
dress
of
celestial
blue
!
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
young
lady
with
her
---
comparatively
stricken
in
years
---
almost
twenty
,
I
should
say
.
 
<EOS>
Her
name
was
Miss
Mills
.
 
<EOS>
and
Dora
called
her
Julia
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
the
bosom
friend
of
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
Happy
Miss
Mills
!
   
<EOS>
Jip
was
there
,
and
Jip
WOULD
bark
at
me
again
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
presented
my
bouquet
,
he
gnashed
his
teeth
with
jealousy
.
 
<EOS>
Well
he
might
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
the
least
idea
how
I
adored
his
mistress
,
well
he
might
!
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
thank
you
,
Mr
Copperfield
!
 
<EOS>
What
dear
flowers
!
"
said
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
had
an
intention
of
saying
(
and
had
been
studying
the
best
form
of
words
for
three
miles
)
<EOS>
that
I
thought
them
beautiful
before
I
saw
them
so
near
HER
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
could
n't
manage
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
too
bewildering
.
 
<EOS>
To
see
her
lay
the
flowers
against
her
little
dimpled
chin
,
was
to
lose
all
presence
of
mind
and
power
of
language
in
a
feeble
ecstasy
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
I
did
n't
say
,
"
Kill
me
,
if
you
have
a
heart
,
Miss
Mills
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
die
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
Then
Dora
held
my
flowers
to
Jip
to
smell
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Jip
growled
,
and
would
n't
smell
them
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Dora
laughed
,
and
held
them
a
little
closer
to
Jip
,
to
make
him
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Jip
laid
hold
of
a
bit
of
geranium
with
his
teeth
,
and
worried
imaginary
cats
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Dora
beat
him
,
and
pouted
,
and
said
,
"
My
poor
beautiful
flowers
!
"
<EOS>
as
compassionately
,
I
thought
,
as
if
Jip
had
laid
hold
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
wished
he
had
!
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
so
glad
to
hear
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
said
Dora
,
"
that
that
cross
Miss
Murdstone
is
not
here
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
gone
to
her
brother
's
marriage
,
and
will
be
away
at
least
three
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
Is
n't
that
delightful
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
said
I
was
sure
it
must
be
delightful
to
her
,
and
all
that
was
delightful
to
her
was
delightful
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
,
with
an
air
of
superior
wisdom
and
benevolence
,
smiled
upon
us
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
the
most
disagreeable
thing
I
ever
saw
,
"
said
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
believe
how
ill
-
tempered
and
shocking
<EOS>
she
is
,
Julia
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
can
,
my
dear
!
"
said
Julia
.
   
<EOS>
"
YOU
can
,
perhaps
,
love
,
"
returned
Dora
,
with
her
hand
on
julia
's
.
<EOS>
"
Forgive
my
not
excepting
you
,
my
dear
,
at
first
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
learnt
,
from
this
,
that
Miss
Mills
had
had
her
trials
in
the
course
of
a
chequered
existence
;
and
that
to
these
,
perhaps
,
I
might
refer
that
wise
benignity
of
manner
which
I
had
already
noticed
.
 
<EOS>
i
found
,
in
the
course
of
the
day
,
that
this
was
the
case
:
Miss
Mills
having
been
unhappy
in
a
misplaced
affection
,
and
being
understood
to
have
retired
from
the
world
on
her
awful
stock
of
experience
,
but
still
to
take
a
calm
interest
in
the
unblighted
hopes
and
loves
of
youth
.
   
<EOS>
But
now
Mr
Spenlow
came
out
of
the
house
,
and
Dora
went
to
him
,
saying
,
"
Look
,
papa
,
what
beautiful
flowers
!
"
<EOS>
And
Miss
Mills
smiled
thoughtfully
,
as
who
should
say
,
"
Ye
Mayflies
,
enjoy
your
brief
existence
in
the
bright
morning
of
life
!
"
<EOS>
And
we
all
walked
from
the
lawn
towards
the
carriage
,
which
was
getting
ready
.
   
<EOS>
I
shall
never
have
such
a
ride
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
had
such
another
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
only
those
three
,
their
hamper
,
my
hamper
,
and
the
guitar
-
case
,
in
the
phaeton
;
and
,
of
course
,
the
phaeton
was
open
;
and
I
rode
behind
it
,
and
Dora
sat
with
her
back
to
the
horses
,
looking
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
kept
the
bouquet
close
to
her
on
the
cushion
,
and
would
n't
allow
Jip
to
sit
on
that
side
of
her
at
all
,
for
fear
he
should
crush
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
often
carried
it
in
her
hand
,
often
refreshed
herself
with
its
fragrance
.
 
<EOS>
Our
eyes
at
those
times
often
met
;
and
my
great
astonishment
is
that
I
did
n't
go
over
the
head
of
my
gallant
grey
into
the
carriage
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
dust
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
good
deal
of
dust
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
faint
impression
that
Mr
Spenlow
remonstrated
with
me
for
riding
in
it
;
but
I
knew
of
none
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
sensible
of
a
mist
of
love
and
beauty
about
Dora
,
but
of
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
up
sometimes
,
and
asked
me
what
I
thought
of
the
prospect
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
it
was
delightful
,
and
I
dare
say
it
was
;
but
it
was
all
Dora
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
shone
Dora
,
and
the
birds
sang
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
The
south
wind
blew
Dora
,
and
the
wild
flowers
in
the
hedges
were
all
Doras
,
to
a
bud
.
 
<EOS>
My
comfort
is
,
Miss
Mills
understood
me
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
alone
could
enter
into
my
feelings
thoroughly
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
long
we
were
going
,
and
to
this
hour
I
know
as
little
where
we
went
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
near
Guildford
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
some
Arabian
-
night
magician
,
opened
up
the
place
for
the
day
,
and
shut
it
up
for
ever
when
we
came
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
green
spot
,
on
a
hill
,
carpeted
with
soft
turf
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
shady
trees
,
and
heather
,
and
,
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
,
a
rich
landscape
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
trying
thing
to
find
people
here
,
waiting
for
us
;
and
my
jealousy
,
even
of
the
ladies
,
knew
no
bounds
.
 
<EOS>
But
all
of
my
own
sex
---
especially
one
impostor
,
three
or
four
years
my
elder
,
with
a
red
whisker
,
on
which
he
established
an
amount
of
presumption
not
to
be
endured
---
were
my
mortal
foes
.
   
<EOS>
We
all
unpacked
our
baskets
,
and
employed
ourselves
in
getting
dinner
ready
.
 
<EOS>
Red
Whisker
pretended
he
could
make
a
salad
(
which
I
do
n't
believe
)
,
and
obtruded
himself
on
public
notice
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
young
ladies
washed
the
lettuces
for
him
,
and
sliced
them
under
his
directions
.
 
<EOS>
Dora
was
among
these
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
that
fate
had
pitted
me
against
this
man
,
and
one
of
us
must
fall
.
   
<EOS>
Red
Whisker
made
his
salad
(
I
wondered
how
they
could
eat
it
.
<EOS>
Nothing
should
have
induced
ME
to
touch
it
!
)
and
voted
himself
into
the
charge
of
the
wine
-
cellar
,
which
he
constructed
,
being
an
ingenious
beast
,
in
the
hollow
trunk
of
a
tree
.
 
<EOS>
By
and
by
<EOS>
,
I
saw
him
,
with
the
majority
of
a
lobster
on
his
plate
,
eating
his
dinner
at
the
feet
of
Dora
!
   
<EOS>
I
have
but
<EOS>
an
indistinct
idea
of
what
happened
for
some
time
after
this
baleful
object
presented
itself
to
my
view
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
very
merry
,
I
know
;
but
it
was
hollow
merriment
.
 
<EOS>
I
attached
myself
to
a
young
creature
in
pink
,
with
little
eyes
,
and
flirted
with
her
desperately
.
 
<EOS>
She
received
my
attentions
with
favour
;
but
whether
on
my
account
solely
,
or
because
she
had
any
designs
on
Red
Whisker
,
I
ca
n't
say
.
 
<EOS>
Dora
's
health
was
drunk
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
drank
it
,
I
affected
to
interrupt
my
conversation
for
that
purpose
,
and
to
resume
it
immediately
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
I
caught
Dora
's
eye
as
I
bowed
to
her
,
and
I
thought
it
looked
appealing
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
looked
at
me
over
the
head
of
Red
Whisker
,
and
I
was
adamant
.
   
<EOS>
The
young
creature
in
pink
had
a
mother
in
green
;
and
I
rather
think
the
latter
separated
us
from
motives
of
policy
.
 
<EOS>
Howbeit
,
there
was
a
general
breaking
up
of
the
party
,
while
the
remnants
of
the
dinner
were
being
put
away
;
and
I
strolled
off
by
myself
among
the
trees
,
in
a
raging
and
remorseful
state
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
debating
whether
I
should
pretend
that
I
was
not
well
,
and
fly
<EOS>
---
I
do
n't
know
where
---
upon
my
gallant
grey
,
when
Dora
and
Miss
Mills
met
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
said
Miss
Mills
,
"
you
are
dull
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
begged
her
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
Not
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
Dora
,
"
said
Miss
Mills
,
"
YOU
are
dull
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Oh
dear
<EOS>
no
!
 
<EOS>
Not
in
the
least
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
and
Dora
,
"
said
Miss
Mills
,
with
an
almost
venerable
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
allow
a
trivial
misunderstanding
to
wither
the
blossoms
of
spring
,
which
,
once
put
forth
and
blighted
,
can
not
be
renewed
.
 
<EOS>
I
speak
,
"
said
Miss
Mills
,
"
from
experience
of
the
past
---
the
remote
,
irrevocable
past
.
 
<EOS>
The
gushing
fountains
which
sparkle
in
the
sun
,
must
not
be
stopped
in
mere
caprice
;
the
oasis
in
the
desert
of
Sahara
must
not
be
plucked
up
idly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
hardly
knew
what
I
did
,
I
was
burning
all
over
to
that
extraordinary
extent
;
but
I
took
Dora
's
little
hand
and
kissed
it
---
and
she
let
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
kissed
Miss
Mills
's
hand
;
and
we
all
seemed
,
to
my
thinking
,
to
go
straight
up
to
the
seventh
heaven
.
<EOS>
We
did
not
come
down
again
.
 
<EOS>
We
stayed
up
there
all
the
evening
.
<EOS>
At
first
we
strayed
to
and
fro
among
the
trees
:
<EOS>
I
with
Dora
's
shy
arm
drawn
through
mine
:
and
Heaven
knows
,
folly
as
it
all
was
,
it
would
have
been
a
happy
fate
to
have
been
struck
immortal
with
those
foolish
feelings
,
and
have
stayed
among
the
trees
for
ever
!
   
<EOS>
But
,
much
too
soon
,
we
heard
the
others
laughing
and
talking
,
and
calling
"
where
's
Dora
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
we
went
back
,
and
they
wanted
Dora
to
sing
.
 
<EOS>
Red
Whisker
would
have
got
the
guitar
-
case
out
of
the
carriage
,
but
Dora
told
him
nobody
knew
where
it
was
,
but
I.
 
So
Red
Whisker
was
done
for
in
a
moment
;
and
I
got
it
,
and
I
unlocked
it
,
and
I
took
the
guitar
out
,
and
I
sat
by
her
,
and
I
held
her
handkerchief
and
gloves
,
and
I
drank
in
every
note
of
her
dear
voice
,
and
she
sang
to
ME
who
loved
her
,
and
all
the
others
might
applaud
as
much
as
they
liked
,
but
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
!
   
<EOS>
I
was
intoxicated
with
joy
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
it
was
too
happy
to
be
real
,
and
that
I
should
wake
in
Buckingham
Street
presently
,
and
hear
Mrs
Crupp
clinking
the
teacups
in
getting
breakfast
ready
.
<EOS>
But
Dora
sang
,
and
others
sang
,
and
Miss
Mills
sang
---
about
the
slumbering
echoes
in
the
caverns
of
Memory
;
as
if
she
were
a
hundred
years
old
---
and
the
evening
came
on
;
and
we
had
tea
,
with
the
kettle
boiling
gipsy
-
fashion
;
and
I
was
still
as
happy
as
ever
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
happier
than
ever
when
the
party
broke
up
,
and
the
other
people
,
defeated
Red
Whisker
and
all
,
went
their
several
ways
,
and
we
went
ours
through
the
still
evening
and
the
dying
light
,
with
sweet
scents
rising
up
around
us
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
being
a
little
drowsy
after
the
champagne
---
honour
to
the
soil
that
grew
the
grape
,
to
the
grape
that
made
the
wine
,
to
the
sun
that
ripened
it
,
and
to
the
merchant
who
adulterated
it
!
<EOS>
---
and
being
fast
asleep
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage
,
I
rode
by
the
side
and
talked
to
Dora
.
<EOS>
She
admired
my
horse
and
patted
him
---
<EOS>
oh
,
what
a
dear
little
hand
it
looked
upon
a
horse
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
her
shawl
would
not
keep
right
,
and
now
<EOS>
and
then
I
drew
it
round
her
with
my
arm
;
and
I
even
fancied
that
Jip
began
to
see
how
it
was
,
and
to
understand
that
he
must
make
up
his
mind
to
be
friends
with
me
.
   
<EOS>
That
sagacious
Miss
Mills
,
too
;
that
amiable
,
though
quite
used
up
,
recluse
;
that
little
patriarch
of
something
less
than
twenty
,
who
had
done
with
the
world
,
and
must
n't
on
any
account
have
the
slumbering
echoes
in
the
caverns
of
Memory
awakened
;
what
a
kind
thing
she
did
!
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
said
Miss
Mills
,
"
come
to
this
side
of
the
carriage
a
moment
---
if
you
can
spare
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Behold
me
,
on
my
gallant
grey
,
bending
at
the
side
of
Miss
Mills
,
with
my
hand
upon
the
carriage
door
!
   
<EOS>
"
Dora
is
coming
to
stay
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
coming
home
with
me
the
day
after
tomorrow
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
would
like
to
call
,
I
am
sure
papa
would
be
happy
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
What
could
I
do
but
invoke
a
silent
blessing
on
Miss
Mills
's
head
,
and
store
Miss
Mills
's
address
in
the
securest
corner
of
my
memory
!
<EOS>
What
could
I
do
but
tell
Miss
Mills
,
with
grateful
looks
and
fervent
words
,
how
much
I
appreciated
her
good
offices
,
and
what
an
inestimable
value
I
set
upon
her
friendship
!
   
<EOS>
Then
Miss
Mills
benignantly
dismissed
me
,
saying
,
"
Go
back
to
Dora
!
"
<EOS>
and
I
went
;
and
Dora
leaned
out
of
the
carriage
to
talk
to
me
,
and
we
talked
all
the
rest
of
the
way
;
and
I
rode
my
gallant
grey
so
close
to
the
wheel
that
I
grazed
his
near
fore
leg
against
it
,
and
"
took
the
bark
off
"
,
as
his
owner
told
me
,
"
to
the
tune
of
three
pun
'
sivin
"
---
which
I
paid
,
and
thought
extremely
cheap
for
so
much
joy
.
 
<EOS>
What
time
Miss
Mills
sat
looking
at
the
moon
,
murmuring
verses
---
and
recalling
,
I
suppose
,
the
ancient
days
when
she
and
earth
had
anything
in
common
.
   
<EOS>
Norwood
was
many
miles
too
near
,
and
we
reached
it
many
hours
too
soon
;
but
Mr
Spenlow
came
to
himself
a
little
short
of
it
,
and
said
,
"
You
must
come
in
,
Copperfield
,
and
rest
!
"
<EOS>
and
I
consenting
,
we
had
sandwiches
and
wine
-
and
-
water
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
light
room
,
Dora
blushing
looked
so
lovely
,
that
I
could
not
tear
myself
away
,
but
sat
there
staring
,
in
a
dream
,
until
the
snoring
of
Mr
Spenlow
inspired
me
with
sufficient
consciousness
to
take
my
leave
.
 
<EOS>
So
we
parted
<EOS>
;
I
riding
all
the
way
to
London
with
the
farewell
touch
of
Dora
's
hand
still
light
on
mine
,
recalling
every
incident
and
word
ten
thousand
times
;
lying
down
in
my
own
bed
at
last
,
as
enraptured
a
young
noodle
as
ever
was
carried
out
of
his
five
wits
by
love
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
awoke
next
morning
,
I
was
resolute
to
declare
my
passion
to
Dora
,
and
know
my
fate
.
 
<EOS>
Happiness
or
misery
was
now
the
question
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
other
question
that
I
knew
of
in
the
world
,
and
only
Dora
could
give
the
answer
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
passed
three
days
in
a
luxury
of
wretchedness
,
torturing
myself
by
putting
every
conceivable
variety
of
discouraging
construction
on
all
that
ever
had
taken
place
between
Dora
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
arrayed
for
the
purpose
at
a
vast
expense
,
I
went
to
Miss
Mills
's
,
fraught
with
a
declaration
.
   
<EOS>
How
many
times
I
went
up
and
down
the
street
,
and
round
the
square
---
painfully
aware
of
being
a
much
better
answer
to
the
old
riddle
than
the
original
one
---
before
I
could
persuade
myself
to
go
up
the
steps
and
knock
,
is
no
matter
now
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
,
at
last
,
I
had
knocked
,
and
was
waiting
at
the
door
,
I
had
some
flurried
thought
of
asking
if
that
were
Mr
Blackboy
's
<EOS>
(
in
imitation
of
poor
Barkis
)
,
begging
pardon
,
and
retreating
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
kept
my
ground
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Mills
was
not
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
expect
he
would
be
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
wanted
HIM
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
was
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
would
do
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
shown
into
a
room
upstairs
,
where
Miss
Mills
and
Dora
were
.
<EOS>
Jip
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
was
copying
music
<EOS>
(
I
recollect
,
it
was
a
new
song
,
called
"
Affection
's
Dirge
"
)
,
and
Dora
was
painting
flowers
.
 
<EOS>
What
were
my
feelings
,
when
I
recognized
my
own
flowers
;
the
identical
Covent
Garden
Market
purchase
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
they
were
very
like
,
or
that
they
particularly
resembled
any
flowers
that
have
ever
come
under
my
observation
;
but
I
knew
from
the
paper
round
them
which
was
accurately
copied
,
what
the
composition
was
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
was
very
glad
to
see
me
,
and
very
sorry
her
papa
was
not
at
home
:
though
I
thought
we
all
bore
that
with
fortitude
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
was
conversational
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
then
,
laying
down
her
pen
upon
"
Affection
's
Dirge
"
,
got
up
,
and
left
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
I
began
to
think
I
would
put
it
off
till
tomorrow
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
your
poor
horse
was
not
tired
,
when
he
got
home
at
night
,
"
said
Dora
,
lifting
up
her
beautiful
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
long
way
for
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
began
to
think
I
would
do
it
today
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
long
way
for
him
,
"
said
I
,
"
for
he
had
nothing
to
uphold
him
on
the
journey
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Was
n't
he
fed
,
poor
thing
?
"
asked
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
I
began
to
think
I
would
put
it
off
till
tomorrow
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ye
-
yes
,
"
I
said
,
"
he
was
well
taken
care
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
he
had
not
the
unutterable
happiness
that
I
had
in
being
so
near
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Dora
bent
her
head
over
her
drawing
and
said
,
after
a
little
while
---
I
had
sat
,
in
the
interval
,
in
a
burning
fever
,
and
with
my
legs
in
a
very
rigid
state
---
   
"
You
did
n't
seem
to
be
sensible
of
that
happiness
yourself
,
at
one
time
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
saw
now
that
I
was
in
for
it
,
and
it
must
be
done
on
the
spot
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
care
for
that
happiness
in
the
least
,
"
said
Dora
,
slightly
raising
her
eyebrows
,
and
shaking
her
head
,
"
when
you
were
sitting
by
Miss
Kitt
.
"
   
<EOS>
Kitt
,
I
should
observe
,
was
the
name
of
the
creature
in
pink
,
with
the
little
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Though
certainly
I
do
n't
know
why
you
should
,
"
said
Dora
,
"
or
why
you
should
call
it
a
happiness
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
But
of
course
you
do
n't
mean
what
you
say
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
am
sure
no
one
doubts
your
being
at
liberty
to
do
whatever
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
Jip
<EOS>
,
you
naughty
boy
,
come
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
I
did
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
it
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
intercepted
Jip
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
Dora
in
my
arms
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
full
of
eloquence
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
stopped
for
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
how
I
loved
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
I
should
die
without
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
that
I
idolized
and
worshipped
her
.
 
<EOS>
Jip
barked
madly
all
the
time
.
   
<EOS>
When
Dora
hung
her
head
and
cried
,
and
trembled
,
my
eloquence
increased
so
much
the
more
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
would
like
me
to
die
for
her
,
she
had
but
<EOS>
to
say
the
word
,
and
I
was
ready
.
 
<EOS>
Life
without
Dora
's
love
was
not
a
thing
to
have
on
any
terms
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
bear
it
,
and
I
would
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
loved
her
every
minute
,
day
and
night
,
since
I
first
saw
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
loved
her
at
that
minute
to
distraction
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
always
love
her
,
every
minute
,
to
distraction
.
 
<EOS>
Lovers
had
loved
before
,
and
lovers
would
love
again
;
but
no
lover
had
loved
,
might
,
could
,
would
,
or
should
ever
love
,
as
I
loved
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
I
raved
,
the
more
Jip
barked
.
 
<EOS>
Each
of
us
,
in
his
own
way
,
got
more
mad
every
moment
.
   
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
 
<EOS>
Dora
and
I
were
sitting
on
the
sofa
by
and
by
,
quiet
enough
,
and
Jip
was
lying
in
her
lap
,
winking
peacefully
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
off
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
in
a
state
of
perfect
rapture
.
 
<EOS>
Dora
and
I
were
engaged
.
   
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
had
some
notion
that
this
was
to
end
in
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
have
had
some
,
because
Dora
stipulated
that
we
were
never
to
be
married
without
her
papa
's
consent
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
our
youthful
ecstasy
,
I
do
n't
think
that
we
really
looked
before
us
or
behind
us
;
or
had
any
aspiration
beyond
the
ignorant
present
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
to
keep
our
secret
from
Mr
Spenlow
;
but
I
am
sure
the
idea
never
entered
my
head
,
then
,
that
there
was
anything
dishonourable
in
that
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
was
more
than
usually
pensive
when
Dora
,
going
to
find
her
,
brought
her
back
;
---
I
apprehend
,
because
there
was
a
tendency
in
what
had
passed
to
awaken
the
slumbering
echoes
in
the
caverns
of
Memory
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
gave
us
her
blessing
,
and
the
assurance
of
her
lasting
friendship
,
and
spoke
to
us
,
generally
,
as
became
a
Voice
from
the
Cloister
.
   
<EOS>
What
an
idle
time
it
was
!
 
<EOS>
What
an
insubstantial
,
happy
,
foolish
time
it
was
!
   
<EOS>
When
I
measured
Dora
's
finger
for
a
ring
that
was
to
be
made
of
Forget
-
me
-
nots
,
and
when
the
jeweller
,
to
whom
I
took
the
measure
,
found
me
out
,
and
laughed
over
his
order
-
book
,
and
charged
me
anything
he
liked
for
the
pretty
little
toy
,
with
its
blue
stones
---
so
associated
in
my
remembrance
with
Dora
's
hand
,
that
yesterday
,
when
I
saw
such
another
,
by
chance
,
on
the
finger
of
my
own
daughter
,
there
was
a
momentary
stirring
in
my
heart
,
like
pain
!
   
<EOS>
When
I
walked
about
,
exalted
with
my
secret
,
and
full
of
my
own
interest
,
and
felt
the
dignity
of
loving
Dora
,
and
of
being
beloved
,
so
much
,
that
if
I
had
walked
the
air
,
I
could
not
have
been
more
above
the
people
not
so
situated
,
who
were
creeping
on
the
earth
!
   
<EOS>
When
we
had
those
meetings
in
the
garden
of
the
square
,
and
sat
within
the
dingy
summer
-
house
,
so
happy
,
that
I
love
the
London
sparrows
to
this
hour
,
for
nothing
else
,
and
see
the
plumage
of
the
tropics
in
their
smoky
feathers
!
<EOS>
When
we
had
our
first
great
quarrel
(
within
a
week
of
our
betrothal
)
,
and
when
Dora
sent
me
back
the
ring
,
enclosed
in
a
despairing
cocked
-
hat
note
,
wherein
she
used
the
terrible
expression
that
"
our
love
had
begun
in
folly
,
and
ended
in
madness
!
"
<EOS>
which
dreadful
words
occasioned
me
to
tear
my
hair
,
and
cry
that
all
was
over
!
   
<EOS>
When
,
under
cover
of
the
night
,
I
flew
to
Miss
Mills
,
whom
I
saw
by
stealth
in
a
back
kitchen
where
there
was
a
mangle
,
and
implored
Miss
Mills
to
interpose
between
us
and
avert
insanity
.
 
<EOS>
When
Miss
Mills
undertook
the
office
and
returned
with
Dora
,
exhorting
us
,
from
the
pulpit
of
her
own
bitter
youth
,
to
mutual
concession
,
and
the
avoidance
of
the
Desert
of
Sahara
!
   
<EOS>
When
we
cried
,
and
made
it
up
,
and
were
so
blest
again
,
that
the
back
kitchen
,
mangle
and
all
,
changed
to
Love
's
own
temple
,
where
we
arranged
a
plan
of
correspondence
through
Miss
Mills
,
always
to
comprehend
at
least
one
letter
on
each
side
every
day
!
   
<EOS>
What
an
idle
time
!
 
<EOS>
What
an
insubstantial
,
happy
,
foolish
time
!
 
<EOS>
Of
all
the
times
of
mine
that
Time
has
in
his
grip
,
there
is
none
that
in
one
retrospect
I
can
smile
at
half
so
much
,
and
think
of
half
so
tenderly
.

Chapter
34
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
astonishes
me
 
<EOS>
I
wrote
to
Agnes
as
soon
as
Dora
and
I
were
engaged
.
 
<EOS>
I
wrote
her
a
long
letter
,
in
which
I
tried
to
make
her
comprehend
how
blest
I
was
,
and
what
a
darling
Dora
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
entreated
Agnes
not
to
regard
this
as
a
thoughtless
passion
which
could
ever
yield
to
any
other
,
or
had
the
least
resemblance
to
the
boyish
fancies
that
we
used
to
joke
about
.
 
<EOS>
I
assured
her
that
its
profundity
was
quite
unfathomable
,
and
expressed
my
belief
that
nothing
like
it
had
ever
been
known
.
   
<EOS>
Somehow
,
as
I
wrote
to
Agnes
on
a
fine
evening
by
my
open
window
,
and
the
remembrance
of
her
clear
calm
eyes
and
gentle
face
came
stealing
over
me
,
it
shed
such
a
peaceful
influence
upon
the
hurry
and
agitation
in
which
I
had
been
living
lately
,
and
of
which
my
very
happiness
partook
in
some
degree
,
that
it
soothed
me
into
tears
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
that
I
sat
resting
my
head
upon
my
hand
,
when
the
letter
was
half
done
,
cherishing
a
general
fancy
as
if
Agnes
were
one
of
the
elements
of
my
natural
home
.
 
<EOS>
As
if
,
in
the
retirement
of
the
house
made
almost
sacred
to
me
by
her
presence
,
Dora
and
I
must
be
happier
than
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
As
if
,
in
love
,
joy
,
sorrow
,
hope
,
or
disappointment
;
in
all
emotions
;
my
heart
turned
naturally
there
,
and
found
its
refuge
and
best
friend
.
   
<EOS>
Of
Steerforth
I
said
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
told
her
there
had
been
sad
grief
at
Yarmouth
,
on
account
of
Emily
's
flight
;
and
that
on
me
it
made
a
double
wound
,
by
reason
of
the
circumstances
attending
it
.
<EOS>
I
knew
how
quick
she
always
was
to
divine
the
truth
,
and
that
she
would
never
be
the
first
to
breathe
his
name
.
   
<EOS>
To
this
letter
,
I
received
an
answer
by
return
of
post
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
read
it
,
I
seemed
to
hear
Agnes
speaking
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
like
her
cordial
voice
in
my
ears
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
I
say
more
!
   
<EOS>
While
I
had
been
away
from
home
lately
,
Traddles
had
called
twice
or
thrice
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
Peggotty
within
,
and
being
informed
by
Peggotty
(
who
always
volunteered
that
information
to
whomsoever
would
receive
it
)
,
<EOS>
that
she
was
my
old
nurse
,
he
had
established
a
good
-
humoured
acquaintance
with
her
,
and
had
stayed
to
have
a
little
chat
with
her
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
So
Peggotty
said
;
<EOS>
but
I
am
afraid
the
chat
was
all
on
her
own
side
,
and
of
immoderate
length
,
as
she
was
very
difficult
indeed
to
stop
,
God
bless
her
!
<EOS>
when
she
had
me
for
her
theme
.
   
<EOS>
This
reminds
me
,
not
only
that
I
expected
Traddles
on
a
certain
afternoon
of
his
own
appointing
,
which
was
now
come
,
but
that
Mrs
Crupp
had
resigned
everything
appertaining
to
her
office
(
the
salary
excepted
)
until
Peggotty
should
cease
to
present
herself
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Crupp
,
after
holding
divers
conversations
respecting
Peggotty
,
in
a
very
high
-
pitched
voice
,
on
the
staircase
---
with
some
invisible
Familiar
it
would
appear
,
for
corporeally
speaking
she
was
quite
alone
at
those
times
---
addressed
a
letter
to
me
,
developing
her
views
.
 
<EOS>
Beginning
it
with
that
statement
of
universal
application
,
which
fitted
every
occurrence
of
her
life
,
namely
,
that
she
was
a
mother
herself
,
she
went
on
to
inform
me
that
she
had
once
seen
very
different
days
,
but
that
at
all
periods
of
her
existence
she
had
had
a
constitutional
objection
to
spies
,
intruders
,
and
informers
.
 
<EOS>
She
named
no
names
<EOS>
,
she
said
;
let
them
the
cap
fitted
,
wear
it
;
but
spies
,
intruders
,
and
informers
,
especially
in
widders
'
weeds
<EOS>
(
this
clause
was
underlined
)
,
she
had
ever
accustomed
herself
to
look
down
upon
.
 
<EOS>
If
a
gentleman
was
the
victim
of
spies
,
intruders
,
and
informers
(
but
still
naming
no
names
)
,
that
was
his
own
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
right
to
please
himself
;
so
let
him
do
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
she
,
Mrs
Crupp
,
stipulated
for
,
was
,
that
she
should
not
be
"
brought
in
contract
"
with
such
persons
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
she
begged
to
be
excused
from
any
further
attendance
on
the
top
set
,
until
things
were
as
they
formerly
was
,
and
as
they
could
be
wished
to
be
;
and
further
mentioned
that
her
little
book
would
be
found
upon
the
breakfast
-
table
every
Saturday
morning
,
when
she
requested
an
immediate
settlement
of
the
same
,
with
the
benevolent
view
of
saving
trouble
"
and
an
ill
-
conwenience
"
to
all
parties
.
   
<EOS>
After
this
,
Mrs
Crupp
confined
herself
to
making
pitfalls
on
the
stairs
,
principally
with
pitchers
,
and
endeavouring
to
delude
Peggotty
into
breaking
her
legs
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
it
rather
harassing
to
live
in
this
state
of
siege
,
but
was
too
much
afraid
of
Mrs
Crupp
to
see
any
way
out
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Copperfield
,
"
cried
Traddles
,
punctually
appearing
at
my
door
,
in
spite
of
all
these
obstacles
,
"
how
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Traddles
,
"
said
I
,
"
I
am
delighted
to
see
you
at
last
,
and
very
sorry
I
have
not
been
at
home
before
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
been
so
much
engaged
---
"
   
"
Yes
,
yes
,
I
know
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
Yours
lives
in
London
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
---
excuse
me
---
Miss
D
,
you
know
,
"
said
Traddles
,
colouring
in
his
great
delicacy
,
"
lives
in
London
<EOS>
,
I
believe
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
.
 
Near
London
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Mine
,
perhaps
you
recollect
,
"
said
Traddles
,
with
a
serious
look
,
"
lives
down
in
Devonshire
---
one
of
ten
.
 
<EOS>
Consequently
,
I
am
not
so
much
engaged
as
you
---
in
that
sense
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
you
can
bear
,
"
I
returned
,
"
to
see
her
so
seldom
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hah
!
"
said
Traddles
,
thoughtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
does
seem
a
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
is
,
Copperfield
,
because
there
is
no
help
for
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
,
"
I
replied
with
a
smile
,
and
not
without
a
blush
.
"
<EOS>
And
because
you
have
so
much
constancy
and
patience
,
Traddles
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
"
said
Traddles
,
considering
about
it
,
"
do
I
strike
you
in
that
way
,
Copperfield
?
 
<EOS>
Really
I
did
n't
know
that
I
had
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
is
such
an
extraordinarily
dear
girl
herself
,
that
it
's
possible
she
may
have
imparted
something
of
those
virtues
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Now
you
mention
it
<EOS>
,
Copperfield
,
I
should
n't
wonder
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
she
is
always
forgetting
herself
,
and
taking
care
of
the
other
nine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
she
the
eldest
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
no
,
"
said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
eldest
is
a
Beauty
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
saw
,
I
suppose
,
that
I
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
simplicity
of
this
reply
;
and
added
,
with
a
smile
upon
his
own
ingenuous
face
:
   
"
<EOS>
Not
,
of
course
,
but
that
my
Sophy
---
pretty
name
,
<EOS>
Copperfield
,
I
always
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
pretty

said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
,
of
course
,
but
that
Sophy
is
beautiful
too
in
my
eyes
,
and
would
be
one
of
the
dearest
girls
that
ever
was
,
in
anybody
's
eyes
(
I
should
think
)

But
when

he
seemed
to
be
describing
clouds
about
himself
,
with
both
hands
:
"
Splendid
,
you
know
,
"
said
Traddles
,
energetically
.
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
assure
you
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
something
very
uncommon
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
Then
,
you
know
,
being
formed
for
society
and
admiration
,
and
not
being
able
to
enjoy
much
of
it
in
consequence
of
their
limited
means
,
she
naturally
gets
a
little
irritable
and
exacting
,
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
Sophy
puts
her
in
good
humour
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Sophy
the
youngest
?
"
<EOS>
I
hazarded
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
,
no
!
"
said
Traddles
,
stroking
his
chin
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
two
youngest
are
only
nine
and
ten

<EOS>
Sophy
educates

The
second
daughter

perhaps
?

I
hazarded

<EOS>
"
No

said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sarah
's
the
second
.
 
<EOS>
Sarah
has
something
the
matter
with
her
spine
,
poor
girl
.
 
<EOS>
The
malady
will
wear
out
by
and
by
,
the
doctors
say
,
but
in
the
meantime
she
has
to
lie
down
for
a
twelvemonth

Sophy
nurses
her

Sophy
's
the
fourth

Is
the
mother
living
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
she
is
alive
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
a
very
superior
woman
indeed
,
but
the
damp
country
is
not
adapted
to
her
constitution
,
and
---
in
fact
,
she
has
lost
the
use
of
her
limbs
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
sad
,
is
it
not
?
"
returned
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
in
a
merely
domestic
view
it
is
not
so
bad
as
it
might
be
,
because
Sophy
takes
her
place
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
quite
as
much
a
mother
to
her
mother
,
as
she
is
to
the
other
nine
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
felt
the
greatest
admiration
for
the
virtues
of
this
young
lady
;
and
,
honestly
with
the
view
of
doing
my
best
to
prevent
the
good
-
nature
of
Traddles
from
being
imposed
upon
,
to
the
detriment
of
their
joint
prospects
in
life
,
inquired
how
Mr
Micawber
was
?
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
quite
well
,
Copperfield
,
thank
you
,
"
said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
living
with
him
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
the
truth
is
,
"
said
Traddles
,
in
a
whisper
,
"
he
had
changed
his
name
to
Mortimer
,
in
consequence
of
his
temporary
embarrassments
;
and
he
do
n't
come
out
till
after
dark
---
and
then
in
spectacles
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
execution
put
into
our
house
,
for
rent
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
was
in
such
a
dreadful
state
that
I
really
could
n't
resist
giving
my
name
to
that
second
bill
we
spoke
of
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
imagine
how
delightful
it
was
to
my
feelings
,
Copperfield
,
to
see
the
matter
settled
with
it
,
and
Mrs
Micawber
recover
her
spirits
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hum
!
<EOS>
"
said
I.
"
<EOS>
Not
that
her
happiness
was
of
long
duration
,
"
pursued
Traddles
,
"
for
,
unfortunately
,
within
a
week
another
execution
came
in
.
 
<EOS>
It
broke
up
the
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
living
in
a
furnished
apartment
since
then
,
and
the
Mortimers
have
been
very
private
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
wo
n't
think
it
selfish
,
Copperfield
,
<EOS>
if
I
mention
that
the
broker
carried
off
my
little
round
table
with
the
marble
top
,
and
Sophy
's
flower
-
pot
and
stand
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
hard
thing
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
indignantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
---
it
was
a
pull
,
"
said
Traddles
,
with
his
usual
wince
at
that
expression
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mention
it
reproachfully
,
however
,
but
with
a
motive
.
 
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
Copperfield
,
I
was
unable
to
repurchase
them
at
the
time
of
their
seizure
;
in
the
first
place
,
because
the
broker
,
having
an
idea
that
I
wanted
them
,
ran
the
price
up
to
an
extravagant
extent
;
and
,
in
the
second
place
,
because
I
---
had
n't
any
money
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
have
kept
my
eye
since
,
upon
the
broker
's
shop
,
"
said
Traddles
,
with
a
great
enjoyment
of
his
mystery
,
"
which
is
up
at
the
top
of
Tottenham
Court
Road
,
and
,
at
last
,
today
I
find
them
put
out
for
sale
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
noticed
them
from
over
the
way
,
because
if
the
broker
saw
me
,
bless
you
,
he
'd
ask
any
price
for
them
!
 
<EOS>
What
has
occurred
to
me
,
having
now
the
money
,
is
,
that
perhaps
you
would
n't
object
to
ask
that
good
nurse
of
yours
to
come
with
me
to
the
shop
<EOS>
---
I
can
show
it
her
from
round
the
corner
of
the
next
street
---
and
make
the
best
bargain
for
them
,
as
if
they
were
for
herself
,
that
she
can
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
delight
with
which
Traddles
propounded
this
plan
to
me
,
and
the
sense
he
had
of
its
uncommon
artfulness
,
are
among
the
freshest
things
in
my
remembrance
.
   
<EOS>
I
told
him
that
my
old
nurse
would
be
delighted
to
assist
him
,
and
that
we
would
all
three
take
the
field
together
,
but
on
one
condition
.
 
<EOS>
That
condition
was
,
that
he
should
make
a
solemn
resolution
to
grant
no
more
loans
of
his
name
,
or
anything
else
,
to
Mr
Micawber
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Copperfield
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
I
have
already
done
so
,
because
I
begin
to
feel
that
I
have
not
only
been
inconsiderate
,
but
that
I
have
been
positively
unjust
to
Sophy
.
 
<EOS>
My
word
being
passed
to
myself
,
there
is
no
longer
any
apprehension
;
but
I
pledge
it
to
you
,
too
,
with
the
greatest
readiness
.
 
<EOS>
That
first
unlucky
obligation
,
I
have
paid
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
Mr
Micawber
would
have
paid
it
if
he
could
,
but
he
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
One
thing
I
ought
to
mention
,
which
I
like
very
much
in
Mr
Micawber
,
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
It
refers
to
the
second
obligation
,
which
is
not
yet
due
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
n't
tell
me
that
it
is
provided
for
,
but
he
says
it
WILL
BE
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
think
there
is
something
very
fair
and
honest
about
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
unwilling
to
damp
my
good
friend
's
confidence
,
and
therefore
assented
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
little
further
conversation
,
we
went
round
to
the
chandler
's
shop
,
to
enlist
Peggotty
;
<EOS>
Traddles
declining
to
pass
the
evening
with
me
,
both
because
he
endured
the
liveliest
apprehensions
that
his
property
would
be
bought
by
somebody
else
before
he
could
re
-
purchase
it
,
and
because
it
was
the
evening
he
always
devoted
to
writing
to
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
I
never
shall
forget
him
peeping
round
the
corner
of
the
street
in
Tottenham
Court
Road
,
while
Peggotty
was
bargaining
for
the
precious
articles
;
or
his
agitation
when
she
came
slowly
towards
us
after
vainly
offering
a
price
,
and
was
hailed
by
the
relenting
broker
,
and
went
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
end
of
the
negotiation
was
,
that
she
bought
the
property
on
tolerably
easy
terms
,
and
Traddles
was
transported
with
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
indeed
,
"
said
Traddles
,
on
hearing
it
was
to
be
sent
to
where
he
lived
,
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
might
ask
one
other
favour
,
I
hope
you
would
not
think
it
absurd
,
Copperfield
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
said
beforehand
,
certainly
not
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
if
you
WOULD
be
good
enough
,
"
said
Traddles
to
Peggotty
,
"
to
get
the
flower
-
pot
now
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
should
like
(
it
being
Sophy
's
,
Copperfield
)
to
carry
it
home
myself
!
"
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
was
glad
to
get
it
for
him
,
and
he
overwhelmed
her
with
thanks
,
and
went
his
way
up
Tottenham
Court
Road
,
carrying
the
flower
-
pot
affectionately
in
his
arms
,
with
one
of
the
most
delighted
expressions
of
countenance
I
ever
saw
.
   
<EOS>
We
then
turned
back
towards
my
chambers
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
shops
had
charms
for
Peggotty
<EOS>
which
I
never
knew
them
possess
in
the
same
degree
for
anybody
else
,
I
sauntered
easily
along
,
amused
by
her
staring
in
at
the
windows
,
and
waiting
for
her
as
often
as
she
chose
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
thus
a
good
while
in
getting
to
the
Adelphi
.
   
<EOS>
On
our
way
upstairs
,
I
called
her
attention
to
the
sudden
disappearance
of
Mrs
Crupp
's
pitfalls
,
and
also
to
the
prints
of
recent
footsteps
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
both
very
much
surprised
,
coming
higher
up
,
to
find
my
outer
door
standing
open
(
which
I
had
shut
)
and
to
hear
voices
inside
.
   
<EOS>
We
looked
at
one
another
,
without
knowing
what
to
make
of
this
,
and
went
into
the
sitting
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
my
amazement
to
find
,
of
all
people
upon
earth
,
my
aunt
there
,
and
Mr
Dick
!
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
sitting
on
a
quantity
of
luggage
,
with
her
two
birds
before
her
,
and
her
cat
on
her
knee
,
like
a
female
Robinson
Crusoe
,
drinking
tea
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
leaning
thoughtfully
on
a
great
kite
,
such
as
we
had
often
been
out
together
to
fly
,
with
more
luggage
piled
about
him
!
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
aunt
!
"
<EOS>
cried
I.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
an
unexpected
pleasure
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
cordially
embraced
;
and
Mr
Dick
and
I
cordially
shook
hands
;
and
Mrs
Crupp
,
who
was
busy
making
tea
,
and
could
not
be
too
attentive
,
cordially
said
she
had
knowed
well
as
Mr
Copperfull
would
have
his
heart
in
his
mouth
,
when
he
see
his
dear
relations
.
   
<EOS>
"
Holloa
!
"
said
my
aunt
to
Peggotty
,
who
quailed
before
her
awful
presence
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
are
YOU
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
remember
my
aunt
,
Peggotty
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
For
the
love
of
goodness
,
child
,
"
exclaimed
my
aunt
,
"
do
n't
call
the
woman
by
that
South
Sea
Island
name
!
 
<EOS>
If
she
married
and
got
rid
of
it
,
which
was
the
best
thing
she
could
do
,
why
do
n't
you
give
her
the
benefit
of
the
change
?
 
<EOS>
What
's
your
name
now
,
---
P
?
"
said
my
aunt
,
as
a
compromise
for
the
obnoxious
appellation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Barkis
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
with
a
curtsey
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
human
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
sounds
less
as
if
you
wanted
a
missionary
.
 
<EOS>
How
d'ye
do
,
Barkis
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
're
well
?
"
   
<EOS>
Encouraged
by
these
gracious
words
,
and
by
my
aunt
's
extending
her
hand
,
Barkis
came
forward
,
and
took
the
hand
,
and
curtseyed
her
acknowledgements
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
older
than
we
were
,
I
see
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
only
met
each
other
once
before
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
A
nice
business
we
made
of
it
then
!
 
<EOS>
Trot
,
my
dear
,
another
cup
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
handed
it
dutifully
to
my
aunt
,
who
was
in
her
usual
inflexible
state
of
figure
;
and
ventured
a
remonstrance
with
her
on
the
subject
of
her
sitting
on
a
box
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
draw
the
sofa
here
,
or
the
easy

chair
,
aunt

said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
be
so
uncomfortable
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Trot
,
"
replied
my
aunt
,
"
I
prefer
to
sit
upon
my
property
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
my
aunt
looked
hard
at
Mrs
Crupp
,
and
observed
,
"
We
need
n't
trouble
you
to
wait
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
put
a
little
more
tea
in
the
pot
afore
<EOS>
I
go
,
ma'am

said
Mrs
Crupp
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
thank
you
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
let
me
fetch
another
pat
of
butter
,
ma'am
?

said
Mrs
Crupp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Or
would
you
be
persuaded
to
try
a
new

laid
hegg

or
should
I
brile

rasher

<EOS>
Ai
n't
there
nothing

could
do

Copperfull

Nothing

returned
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
do
very
well

I
thank
you

<EOS>
Mrs
Crupp
,
who
had
been
incessantly
smiling
to
express
sweet
temper
,
and
incessantly
holding
her
head
on
one
side
,
to
express
a
general
feebleness
of
constitution
,
and
incessantly
rubbing
her
hands
,
to
express
a
desire
to
be
of
service
to
all
deserving
objects

gradually
smiled
herself

one

sided
herself
,
and
rubbed
herself

out
of
the
room

Dick

said
my
aunt

You

told

<EOS>
Mr
Dick
---
with
rather
a
scared
look
,
as
if
he
had
forgotten
it
---
returned
a
hasty
answer
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Crupp
is
one
of
them
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Barkis
,
I
'll
trouble
you
to
look
after
the
tea
,
and
let
me
have
another
cup
,
for
I
do
n't
fancy
that
woman
's
pouring
-
out
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
knew
my
aunt
sufficiently
well
to
know
that
she
had
something
of
importance
on
her
mind
,
and
that
there
was
far
more
matter
in
this
arrival
than
a
stranger
might
have
supposed
.
 
<EOS>
I
noticed
how
her
eye
lighted
on
me
,
when
she
thought
my
attention
otherwise
occupied
;
and
what
a
curious
process
of
hesitation
appeared
to
be
going
on
within
her
,
while
she
preserved
her
outward
stiffness
and
composure
.
 
<EOS>
I
began
to
reflect
whether
I
had
done
anything
to
offend
her
;
and
my
conscience
whispered
me
that
I
had
not
yet
told
her
about
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
Could
it
by
any
means
be
that
,
I
wondered
!
   
<EOS>
As
I
knew
she
would
only
speak
in
her
own
good
time
,
I
sat
down
near
her
,
and
spoke
to
the
birds
,
and
played
with
the
cat
,
and
was
as
easy
as
I
could
be
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
very
far
from
being
really
easy
;
and
I
should
still
have
been
so
,
even
if
Mr
Dick
,
leaning
over
the
great
kite
behind
my
aunt
,
had
not
taken
every
secret
opportunity
of
shaking
his
head
darkly
at
me
,
and
pointing
at
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trot
,
"
said
my
aunt
at
last
,
when
she
had
finished
her
tea
,
and
carefully
smoothed
down
her
dress
,
and
wiped
her
lips
---
<EOS>
"
you
need
n't
go
,
Barkis
!
<EOS>
---
Trot
,
have
you
got
to
be
firm
and
self
-
reliant
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
aunt
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Miss
Betsey
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
,
aunt
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
why
,
my
love
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
looking
earnestly
at
me
,
"
why
do
you
think
I
prefer
to
sit
upon
this
property
of
mine
tonight
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
shook
my
head
,
unable
to
guess
.
   
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
it
's
all
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
Because
I
'm
ruined
,
my
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
If
the
house
,
and
every
one
of
us
,
had
tumbled
out
into
the
river
together
,
I
could
hardly
have
received
a
greater
shock
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dick
knows
it
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
laying
her
hand
calmly
on
my
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
ruined
,
my
dear
Trot
!
 
<EOS>
All
I
have
in
the
world
is
in
this
room
,
except
the
cottage
;
and
that
I
have
left
Janet
to
let
.
 
<EOS>
Barkis
,
I
want
to
get
a
bed
for
this
gentleman
tonight
.
 
<EOS>
To
save
expense
,
perhaps
you
can
make
up
something
here
for
myself
.
<EOS>
Anything
will
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
only
for
tonight
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
talk
about
this
,
more
,
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
roused
from
my
amazement
,
and
concern
for
her
<EOS>
---
I
am
sure
,
for
her
---
by
her
falling
on
my
neck
,
for
a
moment
,
and
crying
that
she
only
grieved
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
moment
she
suppressed
this
emotion
;
and
said
with
an
aspect
more
triumphant
than
dejected
:
   
<EOS>
"
We
must
meet
reverses
boldly
,
and
not
suffer
them
to
frighten
us
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
learn
to
act
the
play
out
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
live
misfortune
down
,
Trot
!

Chapter
35
.
<EOS>
Depression
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
could
recover
my
presence
of
mind
,
which
quite
deserted
me
in
the
first
overpowering
shock
of
my
aunt
's
intelligence
,
I
proposed
to
Mr
Dick
to
come
round
to
the
chandler
's
shop
,
and
take
possession
of
the
bed
which
Mr
Peggotty
had
lately
vacated
.
 
<EOS>
The
chandler
's
shop
being
in
Hungerford
Market
,
and
Hungerford
Market
being
a
very
different
place
in
those
days
<EOS>
,
there
was
a
low
wooden
colonnade
before
the
door
(
not
very
unlike
that
before
the
house
where
the
little
man
and
woman
used
to
live
,
in
the
old
weather
-
glass
)
,
which
pleased
Mr
Dick
mightily
.
<EOS>
The
glory
of
lodging
over
this
structure
would
have
compensated
him
,
I
dare
say
,
for
many
inconveniences
;
but
,
as
there
were
really
few
to
bear
,
beyond
the
compound
of
flavours
I
have
already
mentioned
,
and
perhaps
the
want
of
a
little
more
elbow
-
room
,
he
was
perfectly
charmed
with
his
accommodation
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Crupp
had
indignantly
assured
him
that
there
was
n't
room
to
swing
a
cat
there
;
but
,
as
Mr
Dick
justly
observed
to
me
,
sitting
down
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
nursing
his
leg
,
"
You
know
,
Trotwood
,
I
do
n't
want
to
swing
a
cat
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
do
swing
a
cat
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
what
does
that
signify
to
ME
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
tried
to
ascertain
whether
Mr
Dick
had
any
understanding
of
the
causes
of
this
sudden
and
great
change
in
my
aunt
's
affairs
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
might
have
expected
,
he
had
none
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
account
he
could
give
of
it
was
,
that
my
aunt
had
said
to
him
,
the
day
before
yesterday
,
"
Now
,
Dick
,
are
you
really
and
truly
the
philosopher
<EOS>
I
take
you
for
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
then
he
had
said
,
Yes
,
he
hoped
so
.
 
<EOS>
That
then
my
aunt
had
said
,
"
Dick
,
I
am
ruined
.
"
 
<EOS>
That
then
he
had
said
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
indeed
!
"
That
then
my
aunt
had
praised
him
highly
,
which
he
was
glad
of
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
then
they
had
come
to
me
,
and
had
had
bottled
porter
and
sandwiches
on
the
road
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
was
so
very
complacent
,
sitting
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
nursing
his
leg
,
and
telling
me
this
,
with
his
eyes
wide
open
and
a
surprised
smile
,
that
I
am
sorry
to
say
I
was
provoked
into
explaining
to
him
that
ruin
meant
distress
,
want
,
and
starvation
;
but
I
was
soon
bitterly
reproved
for
this
harshness
,
by
seeing
his
face
turn
pale
,
and
tears
course
down
his
lengthened
cheeks
,
while
he
fixed
upon
me
a
look
of
such
unutterable
woe
,
that
it
might
have
softened
a
far
harder
heart
than
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
infinitely
greater
pains
to
cheer
him
up
again
than
I
had
taken
to
depress
him
;
and
I
soon
understood
(
as
I
ought
to
have
known
at
first
)
that
he
had
been
so
confident
,
merely
because
of
his
faith
in
the
wisest
and
most
wonderful
of
women
,
and
his
unbounded
reliance
on
my
intellectual
resources
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
he
considered
a
match
for
any
kind
of
disaster
not
absolutely
mortal
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
can
we
do
,
Trotwood
?
"
said
Mr
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
Memorial
---
"
   
"
To
be
sure
there
is
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
But
all
we
can
do
just
now
,
Mr
Dick
,
is
to
keep
a
cheerful
countenance
,
and
not
let
my
aunt
see
that
we
are
thinking
about
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
assented
to
this
in
the
most
earnest
manner
;
and
implored
me
,
if
I
should
see
him
wandering
an
inch
out
of
the
right
course
,
to
recall
him
by
some
of
those
superior
methods
which
were
always
at
my
command
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
regret
to
state
that
the
fright
I
had
given
him
proved
too
much
for
his
best
attempts
at
concealment
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
evening
his
eyes
wandered
to
my
aunt
's
face
,
with
an
expression
of
the
most
dismal
apprehension
,
as
if
he
saw
her
growing
thin
on
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
conscious
of
this
,
and
put
a
constraint
upon
his
head
;
but
his
keeping
that
immovable
,
and
sitting
rolling
his
eyes
like
a
piece
of
machinery
,
did
not
mend
the
matter
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
him
look
at
the
loaf
at
supper
(
which
happened
to
be
a
small
one
)
,
as
if
nothing
else
stood
between
us
and
famine
;
and
when
my
aunt
insisted
on
his
making
his
customary
repast
,
I
detected
him
in
the
act
of
pocketing
fragments
of
his
bread
and
cheese
;
I
have
no
doubt
for
the
purpose
of
reviving
us
with
those
savings
,
when
we
should
have
reached
an
advanced
stage
of
attenuation
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
in
a
composed
frame
of
mind
,
which
was
a
lesson
to
all
of
us
---
to
me
,
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
extremely
gracious
to
Peggotty
,
except
when
I
inadvertently
called
her
by
that
name
;
and
,
strange
as
I
knew
she
felt
in
London
,
appeared
quite
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
to
have
my
bed
,
and
I
was
to
lie
in
the
sitting
-
room
,
to
keep
guard
over
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
made
a
great
point
of
being
so
near
the
river
,
in
case
of
a
conflagration
;
and
I
suppose
really
did
find
some
satisfaction
in
that
circumstance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trot
,
my
dear
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
when
she
saw
me
making
preparations
for
compounding
her
usual
night
-
draught
,
"
No
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
aunt
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
wine
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Ale
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
there
is
wine
here
,
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
always
have
it
made
of
wine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Keep
that
,
in
case
of
sickness
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
n't
use
it
carelessly
,
Trot
.
 
<EOS>
Ale
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Half
a
pint
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
thought
Mr
Dick
would
have
fallen
,
insensible
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
being
resolute
,
I
went
out
and
got
the
ale
myself
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
growing
late
,
Peggotty
and
Mr
Dick
took
that
opportunity
of
repairing
to
the
chandler
's
shop
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
parted
from
him
,
poor
fellow
,
at
the
corner
of
the
street
,
with
his
great
kite
at
his
back
,
a
very
monument
of
human
misery
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
when
I
returned
,
crimping
the
borders
of
her
nightcap
with
her
fingers
.
 
<EOS>
I
warmed
the
ale
and
made
the
toast
on
the
usual
infallible
principles
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
was
ready
for
her
,
she
was
ready
for
it
,
with
her
nightcap
on
,
and
the
skirt
of
her
gown
turned
back
on
her
knees
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
after
taking
a
spoonful
of
it
;
"
it
's
a
great
deal
better
than
wine
.
 
<EOS>
Not
half
so
bilious
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
looked
doubtful
,
for
she
added
:
   
<EOS>
"
Tut
,
tut
,
child
.
 
<EOS>
If
nothing
worse
than
Ale
happens
to
us
,
we
are
well
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
myself
,
aunt
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
why
DON'T
you
think
so
?
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Because
you
and
I
are
very
different
people
,
"
I
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stuff
and
nonsense
,
Trot
!
"
replied
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
MY
aunt
went
on
with
a
quiet
enjoyment
,
in
which
there
was
very
little
affectation
,
if
any
;
drinking
the
warm
ale
with
a
tea
-
spoon
,
and
soaking
her
strips
of
toast
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trot
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
do
n't
care
for
strange
faces
in
general
,
but
I
rather
like
that
Barkis
of
yours
,
do
you
know
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
better
than
a
hundred
pounds
to
hear
you
say
so
!
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
most
extraordinary
world
,
"
observed
my
aunt
,
rubbing
her
nose
;
"
how
that
woman
ever
got
into
it
with
that
name
,
is
unaccountable
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
much
more
easy
to
be
born
a
Jackson
,
or
something
of
that
sort
,
one
would
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
she
thinks
so
,
too
;
it
's
not
her
fault
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
,
"
returned
my
aunt
,
rather
grudging
the
admission
;
"
but
it
's
very
aggravating
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
she
's
Barkis
now
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
some
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
Barkis
is
uncommonly
fond
of
you
,
Trot
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
she
would
leave
undone
to
prove
it
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
I
believe
,
"
returned
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
the
poor
fool
has
been
begging
and
praying
about
handing
over
some
of
her
money
---
because
she
has
got
too
much
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
simpleton
!
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
's
tears
of
pleasure
were
positively
trickling
down
into
the
warm
ale
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
's
the
most
ridiculous
creature
that
ever
was
born
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
,
from
the
first
moment
when
I
saw
her
with
that
poor
dear
blessed
baby
of
a
mother
of
yours
,
that
she
was
the
most
ridiculous
of
mortals
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
are
good
points
in
Barkis
!
"
   
<EOS>
Affecting
to
laugh
,
she
got
an
opportunity
of
putting
her
hand
to
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Having
availed
herself
of
it
,
she
resumed
her
toast
and
her
discourse
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Mercy
upon
us
!
<EOS>
"
sighed
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
all
about
it
,
Trot
!
<EOS>
Barkis
and
myself
had
quite
a
gossip
while
you
were
out
with
Dick
.
<EOS>
I
know
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
where
these
wretched
girls
expect
to
go
to
,
for
my
part
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
they
do
n't
knock
out
their
brains
against
---
against
mantelpieces
,
"
said
my
aunt
;
an
idea
which
was
probably
suggested
to
her
by
her
contemplation
of
mine
.
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
Emily
!
<EOS>
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
talk
to
me
about
poor
,
"
returned
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
should
have
thought
of
that
,
before
she
caused
so
much
misery
!
 
<EOS>
Give
me
a
kiss
,
Trot
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
for
your
early
experience
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
I
bent
forward
,
she
put
her
tumbler
on
my
knee
to
detain
me
,
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Trot
,
Trot
!
 
<EOS>
And
so
you
fancy
yourself
in
love
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fancy
,
aunt
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaimed
,
as
red
as
I
could
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
adore
her
with
my
whole
soul
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dora
,
indeed
!
"
returned
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
mean
to
say
the
little
thing
is
very
fascinating
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
aunt
,
"
I
replied
,
"
no
one
can
form
the
least
idea
what
she
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
And
not
silly
?
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Silly
,
aunt
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
seriously
believe
it
had
never
once
entered
my
head
for
a
single
moment
,
to
consider
whether
she
was
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
resented
the
idea
,
of
course
;
but
I
was
in
a
manner
struck
by
it
,
as
a
new
one
altogether
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
light
-
headed
?
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Light
-
headed
,
aunt
!
<EOS>
"
I
could
only
repeat
this
daring
speculation
with
the
same
kind
of
feeling
with
which
I
had
repeated
the
preceding
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
ask
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
depreciate
her
.
<EOS>
Poor
little
couple
!
 
<EOS>
And
so
you
think
you
were
formed
for
one
another
,
and
are
to
go
through
a
party
-
supper
-
table
kind
of
life
,
like
two
pretty
pieces
of
confectionery
,
do
you
,
Trot
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
asked
me
this
so
kindly
,
and
with
such
a
gentle
air
,
half
playful
and
half
sorrowful
,
that
I
was
quite
touched
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
young
and
inexperienced
,
aunt
,
I
know
,
"
<EOS>
I
replied
;
"
and
I
dare
say
we
say
and
think
a
good
deal
that
is
rather
foolish
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
love
one
another
truly
,
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
thought
Dora
could
ever
love
anybody
else
,
or
cease
to
love
me
;
or
that
I
could
ever
love
anybody
else
,
or
cease
to
love
her
;
I
do
n't
know
what
I
should
do
---
go
out
of
my
mind
,
I
think
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Trot
!
"
said
my
aunt
,
shaking
her
head
,
and
smiling
gravely
;
"
blind
,
blind
,
blind
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Someone
that
I
know
,
Trot
,
"
my
aunt
pursued
,
after
a
pause
,
"
though
of
a
very
pliant
disposition
,
has
an
earnestness
of
affection
in
him
that
reminds
me
of
poor
Baby
.
 
<EOS>
Earnestness
is
what
that
Somebody
must
look
for
,
to
sustain
him
and
improve
him
,
Trot
.
<EOS>
Deep
,
downright
,
faithful
earnestness
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
only
knew
the
earnestness
of
Dora
,
aunt
!
"
I
cried
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Trot
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
again
;
"
blind
,
blind
!
"
<EOS>
and
without
knowing
why
,
I
felt
a
vague
unhappy
loss
or
want
of
something
overshadow
me
like
a
cloud
.
   
<EOS>
"
However
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
I
do
n't
want
to
put
two
young
creatures
out
of
conceit
with
themselves
,
or
to
make
them
unhappy
;
so
,
though
it
is
a
girl
and
boy
attachment
,
and
girl
and
boy
attachments
very
often
---
mind
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
always
!
<EOS>
---
come
to
nothing
,
still
we
'll
be
serious
about
it
,
and
hope
for
a
prosperous
issue
one
of
these
days
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
time
enough
for
it
to
come
to
anything
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
not
upon
the
whole
very
comforting
to
a
rapturous
lover
;
but
I
was
glad
to
have
my
aunt
in
my
confidence
,
and
I
was
mindful
of
her
being
fatigued
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
thanked
her
ardently
for
this
mark
of
her
affection
,
and
for
all
her
other
kindnesses
towards
me
;
and
after
a
tender
good
night
,
she
took
her
nightcap
into
my
bedroom
.
   
<EOS>
How
miserable
I
was
,
when
I
lay
down
!
 
<EOS>
How
I
thought
and
thought
about
my
being
poor
,
in
Mr
Spenlow
's
eyes
;
about
my
not
being
what
I
thought
I
was
,
when
I
proposed
to
Dora
;
about
the
chivalrous
necessity
of
telling
Dora
what
my
worldly
condition
was
,
and
releasing
her
from
her
engagement
if
she
thought
fit
;
about
how
I
should
contrive
to
live
,
during
the
long
term
of
my
articles
,
when
I
was
earning
nothing
;
about
doing
something
to
assist
my
aunt
,
and
seeing
no
way
of
doing
anything
;
about
coming
down
to
have
no
money
in
my
pocket
,
and
to
wear
a
shabby
coat
,
and
to
be
able
to
carry
Dora
no
little
presents
,
and
to
ride
no
gallant
greys
,
and
to
show
myself
in
no
agreeable
light
!
 
<EOS>
Sordid
and
selfish
as
I
knew
it
was
,
and
as
I
tortured
myself
by
knowing
that
it
was
,
to
let
my
mind
run
on
my
own
distress
so
much
,
I
was
so
devoted
to
Dora
that
I
could
not
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
that
it
was
base
in
me
not
to
think
more
of
my
aunt
,
and
less
of
myself
;
but
,
so
far
,
selfishness
was
inseparable
from
Dora
,
and
I
could
not
put
Dora
on
one
side
for
any
mortal
creature
.
 
<EOS>
How
exceedingly
miserable
I
was
,
that
night
!
   
<EOS>
As
to
sleep
,
I
had
dreams
of
poverty
in
all
sorts
of
shapes
,
but
I
seemed
to
dream
without
the
previous
ceremony
of
going
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
Now
I
was
ragged
,
wanting
to
sell
Dora
matches
,
six
bundles
for
a
halfpenny
;
now
I
was
at
the
office
in
a
nightgown
and
boots
,
remonstrated
with
by
Mr
Spenlow
on
appearing
before
the
clients
in
that
airy
attire
;
now
I
was
hungrily
picking
up
the
crumbs
that
fell
from
old
Tiffey
's
daily
biscuit
,
regularly
eaten
when
St
Paul
's
struck
one
;
now
I
was
hopelessly
endeavouring
to
get
a
licence
to
marry
Dora
,
having
nothing
but
one
of
Uriah
Heep
's
gloves
to
offer
in
exchange
,
which
the
whole
Commons
rejected
;
and
still
,
more
or
less
conscious
of
my
own
room
,
I
was
always
tossing
about
like
a
distressed
ship
in
a
sea
of
bed
-
clothes
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
was
restless
,
too
,
for
I
frequently
heard
her
walking
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
Two
or
,
three
times
in
the
course
of
the
night
,
attired
in
a
long
flannel
wrapper
in
which
she
looked
seven
feet
high
,
she
appeared
,
like
a
disturbed
ghost
,
in
my
room
,
and
came
to
the
side
of
the
sofa
on
which
I
lay
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
first
occasion
I
started
up
in
alarm
,
to
learn
that
she
inferred
from
a
particular
light
in
the
sky
,
that
Westminster
Abbey
was
on
fire
;
and
to
be
consulted
in
reference
to
the
probability
of
its
igniting
Buckingham
Street
,
in
case
the
wind
changed
.
 
<EOS>
Lying
still
,
after
that
,
I
found
that
she
sat
down
near
me
,
whispering
to
herself
"
Poor
boy
!
"
<EOS>
And
then
it
made
me
twenty
times
more
wretched
,
to
know
how
unselfishly
mindful
she
was
of
me
,
and
how
selfishly
mindful
I
was
of
myself
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
difficult
to
believe
that
a
night
so
long
to
me
,
could
be
short
to
anybody
else
.
 
<EOS>
This
consideration
set
me
thinking
and
thinking
of
an
imaginary
party
where
people
were
dancing
the
hours
away
,
until
that
became
a
dream
too
,
and
I
heard
the
music
incessantly
playing
one
tune
,
and
saw
Dora
incessantly
dancing
one
dance
,
without
taking
the
least
notice
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
who
had
been
playing
the
harp
all
night
,
was
trying
in
vain
to
cover
it
with
an
ordinary
-
sized
nightcap
,
when
I
awoke
;
or
I
should
rather
say
,
when
I
left
off
trying
to
go
to
sleep
,
and
saw
the
sun
shining
in
through
the
window
at
last
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
an
old
Roman
bath
in
those
days
at
the
bottom
of
one
of
the
streets
out
of
the
Strand
---
it
may
be
there
still
---
in
which
I
have
had
many
a
cold
plunge
.
 
<EOS>
Dressing
myself
as
quietly
as
I
could
,
and
leaving
Peggotty
to
look
after
my
aunt
,
I
tumbled
head
foremost
into
it
,
and
then
went
for
a
walk
to
Hampstead
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
hope
that
this
brisk
treatment
might
freshen
my
wits
a
little
;
and
I
think
it
did
them
good
,
for
I
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
first
step
I
ought
to
take
was
,
to
try
if
my
articles
could
be
cancelled
and
the
premium
recovered
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
some
breakfast
on
the
Heath
,
and
walked
back
to
Doctors
'
Commons
,
along
the
watered
roads
   
and
through
a
pleasant
smell
of
summer
flowers
,
growing
in
gardens
and
carried
into
town
on
hucksters
'
heads
,
intent
on
this
first
effort
to
meet
our
altered
circumstances
.
   
<EOS>
I
arrived
at
the
office
so
soon
,
after
all
,
<EOS>
that
I
had
half
an
hour
's
loitering
about
the
Commons
,
before
old
Tiffey
,
who
was
always
first
,
appeared
with
his
key
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
sat
down
in
my
shady
corner
,
looking
up
at
the
sunlight
on
the
opposite
chimney
-
pots
,
and
thinking
about
Dora
;
until
Mr
Spenlow
came
in
,
crisp
and
curly
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
,
Copperfield
?
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fine
morning
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Beautiful
morning
,
sir
,
"
said
<EOS>
I.
 
"
Could
I
say
a
word
to
you
before
you
go
into
Court
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
,
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
into
my
room
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
followed
him
into
his
room
,
and
he
began
putting
on
his
gown
,
and
touching
himself
up
before
a
little
glass
he
had
,
hanging
inside
a
closet
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
"
said
I
,
"
that
I
have
some
rather
disheartening
intelligence
from
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
Not
paralysis
,
I
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
has
no
reference
to
her
health
,
sir
,
"
I
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
met
with
some
large
losses
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
she
has
very
little
left
,
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
as
-
tound
me
,
Copperfield
!
"
cried
Mr
Spenlow
.
   
<EOS>
I
shook
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
sir
,
"
said
I
,
"
her
affairs
are
so
changed
,
that
I
wished
to
ask
you
whether
it
would
be
possible
---
at
a
sacrifice
on
our
part
of
some
portion
of
the
premium
,
of
course
,
"
I
put
in
this
,
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
warned
by
the
blank
expression
of
his
face
---
"
to
cancel
my
articles
?
"
   
<EOS>
What
it
cost
me
to
make
this
proposal
,
nobody
knows
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
like
asking
,
as
a
favour
,
to
be
sentenced
to
transportation
from
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
cancel
your
articles
,
Copperfield
?
 
<EOS>
Cancel
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
explained
with
tolerable
firmness
,
that
I
really
did
not
know
where
my
means
of
subsistence
were
to
come
from
,
unless
I
could
earn
them
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
fear
for
the
future
,
I
said
---
<EOS>
and
I
laid
great
emphasis
on
that
,
as
if
to
imply
that
I
should
still
be
decidedly
eligible
for
a
son
-
in
-
law
one
of
these
days
---
but
,
for
the
present
,
I
was
thrown
upon
my
own
resources
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
extremely
sorry
to
hear
this
,
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Extremely
sorry
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
usual
to
cancel
articles
for
any
such
reason
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
a
professional
course
of
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
a
convenient
precedent
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Far
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
---
"
   
"
You
are
very
good
,
sir
,
"
I
murmured
,
anticipating
a
concession
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
mention
it
,
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
the
same
time
,
I
was
going
to
say
,
if
it
had
been
my
lot
to
have
my
hands
unfettered
---
if
I
had
not
a
partner
---
<EOS>
Mr
Jorkins
---
"
   
My
hopes
were
dashed
in
a
moment
,
but
I
made
another
effort
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
,
sir
,
"
said
I
,
"
if
I
were
to
mention
it
to
Mr
Jorkins
---
"
   
Mr
Spenlow
shook
his
head
discouragingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
forbid
,
Copperfield
<EOS>
,
"
he
replied
,
"
that
I
should
do
any
man
an
injustice
:
still
less
,
Mr
jorkins
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
know
my
partner
,
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
jorkins
is
not
a
man
to
respond
to
a
proposition
of
this
peculiar
nature
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
jorkins
is
very
difficult
to
move
from
the
beaten
track
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
what
he
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
knew
nothing
about
him
,
except
that
he
had
originally
been
alone
in
the
business
,
and
now
lived
by
himself
in
a
house
near
Montagu
Square
,
which
was
fearfully
in
want
of
painting
;
that
he
came
very
late
of
a
day
,
and
went
away
very
early
;
that
he
never
appeared
to
be
consulted
about
anything
;
and
that
he
had
a
dingy
little
black
-
hole
of
his
own
upstairs
,
where
no
business
was
ever
done
,
and
where
there
was
a
yellow
old
cartridge
-
paper
pad
upon
his
desk
,
unsoiled
by
ink
,
and
reported
to
be
twenty
years
of
age
.
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
object
to
my
mentioning
it
to
him
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
no
means
,
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
some
experience
of
Mr
jorkins
,
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
it
were
otherwise
,
for
I
should
be
happy
to
meet
your
views
in
any
respect
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
have
the
objection
to
your
mentioning
it
to
Mr
jorkins
,
Copperfield
,
if
you
think
it
worth
while
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Availing
myself
of
this
permission
,
which
was
given
with
a
warm
shake
of
the
hand
,
I
sat
thinking
about
Dora
,
and
looking
at
the
sunlight
stealing
from
the
chimney
-
pots
down
the
wall
of
the
opposite
house
,
until
Mr
jorkins
came
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
went
up
to
Mr
jorkins
's
room
,
and
evidently
astonished
Mr
jorkins
very
much
by
making
my
appearance
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
jorkins
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
in
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
went
in
,
and
sat
down
;
and
stated
my
case
to
Mr
jorkins
pretty
much
as
I
had
stated
it
to
Mr
Spenlow
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jorkins
was
not
by
any
means
the
awful
creature
one
might
have
expected
,
but
a
large
,
mild
,
smooth
-
faced
man
of
sixty
,
who
took
so
much
snuff
that
there
was
a
tradition
in
the
Commons
that
he
lived
principally
on
that
stimulant
,
having
little
room
in
his
system
for
any
other
article
of
diet
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
mentioned
this
to
Mr
Spenlow
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Mr
jorkins
;
when
he
had
heard
me
,
very
restlessly
,
to
an
end
.
   
<EOS>
I
answered
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
told
him
that
Mr
Spenlow
had
introduced
his
name
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
said
I
should
object
?
"
asked
Mr
jorkins
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
admit
that
Mr
Spenlow
had
considered
it
probable
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
I
ca
n't
advance
your
object
,
"
said
Mr
jorkins
,
nervously
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
---
<EOS>
but
I
have
an
appointment
at
the
Bank
,
if
you
'll
have
the
goodness
to
excuse
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
he
rose
in
a
great
hurry
,
and
was
going
out
of
the
room
,
when
I
made
bold
to
say
that
I
feared
,
then
<EOS>
,
there
was
no
way
of
arranging
the
matter
?
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Mr
jorkins
,
stopping
at
the
door
to
shake
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
I
object
,
you
know
,
"
which
he
said
very
rapidly
,
and
went
out
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
aware
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
he
added
,
looking
restlessly
in
at
the
door
again
,
"
if
Mr
Spenlow
objects
---
"
   
"
Personally
,
he
does
not
object
,
sir
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
Personally
!
"
repeated
Mr
Jorkins
,
in
an
impatient
manner
.
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
there
's
an
objection
,
Mr
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
Hopeless
!
<EOS>
What
you
wish
to
be
done
,
ca
n't
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
really
have
got
an
appointment
at
the
Bank
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
that
he
fairly
ran
away
;
and
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
,
it
was
three
days
before
he
showed
himself
in
the
Commons
again
.
   
<EOS>
Being
very
anxious
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
<EOS>
,
I
waited
until
Mr
Spenlow
came
in
,
and
then
described
what
had
passed
;
giving
him
to
understand
that
I
was
not
hopeless
of
his
being
able
to
soften
the
adamantine
jorkins
,
if
he
would
undertake
the
task
.
   
<EOS>
"
Copperfield
,
"
returned
Mr
Spenlow
,
with
a
gracious
smile
,
"
<EOS>
you
have
not
known
my
partner
,
<EOS>
Mr
jorkins
,
as
long
as
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
is
farther
from
my
thoughts
than
to
attribute
any
degree
of
artifice
to
Mr
jorkins
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
jorkins
has
a
way
of
stating
his
objections
which
often
deceives
people
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
Copperfield
!
"
<EOS>
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
jorkins
is
not
to
be
moved
,
believe
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
completely
bewildered
between
Mr
Spenlow
and
Mr
jorkins
<EOS>
,
as
to
which
of
them
really
was
the
objecting
partner
;
but
I
saw
with
sufficient
clearness
that
there
was
obduracy
somewhere
in
the
firm
,
and
that
the
recovery
of
my
aunt
's
thousand
pounds
was
out
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
state
of
despondency
,
which
I
remember
with
anything
but
satisfaction
,
for
I
know
it
still
had
too
much
reference
to
myself
(
though
always
in
connexion
with
Dora
)
,
I
left
the
office
,
and
went
homeward
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
trying
to
familiarize
my
mind
with
the
worst
,
and
to
present
to
myself
the
arrangements
we
should
have
to
make
for
the
future
in
their
sternest
aspect
,
when
a
hackney
-
chariot
coming
after
me
,
and
stopping
at
my
very
feet
,
occasioned
me
to
look
up
.
 
<EOS>
A
fair
hand
was
stretched
forth
to
me
from
the
window
;
and
the
face
I
had
never
seen
without
a
feeling
of
serenity
and
happiness
,
from
the
moment
when
it
first
turned
back
on
the
old
oak
staircase
with
the
great
broad
balustrade
,
and
when
I
associated
its
softened
beauty
with
the
stained
-
glass
window
in
the
church
,
was
smiling
on
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Agnes
!
<EOS>
"
I
joyfully
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
Agnes
,
of
all
people
in
the
world
,
what
a
pleasure
to
see
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
,
indeed
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
in
her
cordial
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
talk
to
you
so
much
!
"
<EOS>
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
such
a
lightening
of
my
heart
,
only
to
look
at
you
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
had
a
conjuror
's
cap
,
there
is
no
one
I
should
have
wished
for
but
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
returned
Agnes
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
perhaps
Dora
first
,
"
I
admitted
,
with
a
blush
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
Dora
first
,
I
hope
,
"
said
Agnes
,
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
you
next
!
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
going
to
my
rooms
to
see
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
being
very
fine
,
she
was
glad
to
come
out
of
the
chariot
,
<EOS>
which
smelt
(
I
had
my
head
in
it
all
this
time
)
like
a
stable
put
under
a
cucumber
-
frame
.
 
<EOS>
I
dismissed
the
coachman
,
and
she
took
my
arm
,
and
we
walked
on
together
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
like
Hope
embodied
,
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
How
different
I
felt
in
one
short
minute
,
having
Agnes
at
my
side
!
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
had
written
her
one
of
the
odd
,
abrupt
notes
---
very
little
longer
than
a
Bank
note
---
to
which
her
epistolary
efforts
were
usually
limited
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
stated
therein
that
she
had
fallen
into
adversity
,
and
was
leaving
Dover
for
good
,
but
had
quite
made
up
her
mind
to
it
,
and
was
so
well
that
nobody
need
<EOS>
be
uncomfortable
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
had
come
to
London
to
see
my
aunt
,
between
whom
and
herself
there
had
been
a
mutual
liking
these
many
years
:
indeed
,
it
dated
from
the
time
of
my
taking
up
my
residence
in
Mr
Wickfield
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
not
alone
,
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
Her
papa
was
with
her
---
and
Uriah
Heep
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
now
they
are
partners
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
Confound
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
have
some
business
here
;
and
I
took
advantage
of
their
coming
,
to
come
too
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
think
my
visit
all
friendly
and
disinterested
,
Trotwood
,
for
---
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
I
may
be
cruelly
prejudiced
---
I
do
not
like
to
let
papa
go
away
alone
,
with
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
he
exercise
the
same
influence
over
Mr
Wickfield
still
,
Agnes
?
"
   
<EOS>
Agnes
shook
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
such
a
change
at
home
,
"
said
she
,
"
that
you
would
scarcely
know
the
dear
old
house
.
 
<EOS>
They
live
with
us
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Heep
and
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
He
sleeps
in
your
old
room
,
"
said
Agnes
,
looking
up
into
my
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
the
ordering
of
his
dreams
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
He
would
n't
sleep
there
long
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
keep
my
own
little
room
,
"
said
Agnes
,
"
where
I
used
to
learn
my
lessons
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
time
goes
!
 
<EOS>
You
remember
?
 
<EOS>
The
little
panelled
room
that
opens
from
the
drawing
-
room
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Remember
,
Agnes
?
 
<EOS>
When
I
saw
you
,
for
the
first
time
,
coming
out
at
the
door
,
with
your
quaint
little
basket
of
keys
hanging
at
your
side
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
just
the
same
,
"
said
Agnes
,
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
think
of
it
so
pleasantly
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
very
happy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
were
,
indeed
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
keep
that
room
to
myself
still
;
but
I
can
not
always
desert
Mrs
Heep
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
"
said
Agnes
,
quietly
,
"
<EOS>
I
feel
obliged
to
bear
her
company
,
when
I
might
prefer
to
be
alone
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
no
other
reason
to
complain
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
tires
me
,
sometimes
,
by
her
praises
of
her
son
,
it
is
only
natural
in
a
mother
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
very
good
son
to
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
looked
at
Agnes
when
she
said
these
words
,
without
detecting
in
her
any
consciousness
of
Uriah
's
design
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mild
but
<EOS>
earnest
eyes
met
mine
with
their
own
beautiful
frankness
,
and
there
was
no
change
in
her
gentle
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
chief
evil
of
their
presence
in
the
house
,
"
said
Agnes
,
"
is
that
I
can
not
be
as
near
papa
as
I
could
wish
---
<EOS>
Uriah
Heep
being
so
much
between
us
---
and
can
not
watch
over
him
,
if
that
is
not
too
bold
a
thing
to
say
,
as
closely
as
I
would
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
any
fraud
or
treachery
is
practising
against
him
,
I
hope
that
simple
love
and
truth
will
be
strong
in
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
that
real
love
and
truth
are
stronger
in
the
end
than
any
evil
or
misfortune
in
the
world
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
certain
bright
smile
,
which
I
never
saw
on
any
other
face
,
died
away
,
even
while
I
thought
how
good
it
was
,
and
how
familiar
it
had
once
been
to
me
;
and
she
asked
me
,
with
a
quick
change
of
expression
(
we
were
drawing
very
near
my
street
)
,
if
I
knew
how
the
reverse
in
my
aunt
's
circumstances
had
been
brought
about
.
 
<EOS>
On
my
replying
no
,
she
had
not
told
me
yet
,
Agnes
became
thoughtful
,
and
I
fancied
I
felt
her
arm
tremble
in
mine
.
   
<EOS>
We
found
my
aunt
alone
,
in
a
state
of
some
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
A
difference
of
opinion
had
arisen
between
herself
and
Mrs
Crupp
,
on
an
abstract
question
(
the
propriety
of
chambers
being
inhabited
by
the
gentler
sex
)
;
and
my
aunt
,
utterly
indifferent
to
spasms
on
the
part
of
Mrs
Crupp
,
had
cut
the
dispute
short
,
by
informing
that
lady
that
she
smelt
of
my
brandy
,
and
that
she
would
trouble
her
to
walk
out
.
 
<EOS>
Both
of
these
expressions
Mrs
Crupp
considered
actionable
,
and
had
expressed
her
intention
of
bringing
before
a
"
British
Judy
"
---
<EOS>
meaning
,
it
was
supposed
,
the
bulwark
of
our
national
liberties
.
   
<EOS>
MY
aunt
,
however
,
having
had
time
to
cool
,
while
Peggotty
was
out
showing
Mr
Dick
the
soldiers
at
the
Horse
Guards
---
and
being
,
besides
,
greatly
pleased
to
see
Agnes
<EOS>
---
rather
plumed
herself
on
the
affair
than
otherwise
,
and
received
us
with
unimpaired
good
humour
.
 
<EOS>
When
Agnes
laid
her
bonnet
on
the
table
,
and
sat
down
beside
her
,
I
could
not
but
think
,
looking
on
her
mild
eyes
and
her
radiant
forehead
,
how
natural
it
seemed
to
have
her
there
;
how
trustfully
,
although
she
was
so
young
and
inexperienced
,
my
aunt
confided
in
her
;
how
strong
she
was
,
indeed
,
in
simple
love
and
truth
.
   
<EOS>
We
began
to
talk
about
my
aunt
's
losses
,
and
I
told
them
what
I
had
tried
to
do
that
morning
.
   
<EOS>
"
Which
was
injudicious
,
Trot
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
but
well
meant
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
generous
boy
<EOS>
---
I
suppose
I
must
say
,
young
man
,
now
---
and
<EOS>
I
am
proud
of
you
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
So
far
,
so
good
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Trot
and
Agnes
,
let
us
look
the
case
of
Betsey
Trotwood
in
the
face
,
and
see
how
it
stands
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
observed
Agnes
turn
pale
,
as
she
looked
very
attentively
at
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
patting
her
cat
,
looked
very
attentively
at
Agnes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Betsey
Trotwood
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
who
had
always
kept
her
money
matters
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
"
---
I
do
n't
mean
your
sister
,
Trot
,
my
dear
,
but
myself
---
had
a
certain
property
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
n't
matter
how
much
;
enough
to
live
on
.
 
<EOS>
More
;
for
she
had
saved
a
little
,
and
added
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Betsey
funded
her
property
for
some
time
,
and
then
,
by
the
advice
of
her
man
of
business
,
laid
it
out
on
landed
security
.
<EOS>
That
did
very
well
,
and
returned
very
good
interest
,
till
Betsey
was
paid
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
talking
of
Betsey
as
if
she
was
a
man
-
of
-
war
.
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
Then
,
Betsey
had
to
look
about
her
,
for
a
new
investment
.
<EOS>
She
thought
she
was
wiser
,
now
,
than
her
man
of
business
,
who
was
not
such
a
good
man
of
business
by
this
time
,
as
he
used
to
be
---
I
am
alluding
to
your
father
,
Agnes
---
and
she
took
it
into
her
head
to
lay
it
out
for
herself
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
took
her
pigs
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
to
a
foreign
market
;
and
a
very
bad
market
it
turned
out
to
be
.
<EOS>
First
,
she
lost
in
the
mining
way
,
and
then
she
lost
in
the
diving
way
---
fishing
up
treasure
,
or
some
such
Tom
Tiddler
nonsense
,
"
explained
my
aunt
,
rubbing
her
nose
;
"
and
then
she
lost
in
the
mining
way
again
,
and
,
last
of
all
,
to
set
the
thing
entirely
to
rights
,
she
lost
in
the
banking
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
the
Bank
shares
were
worth
for
a
little
while
,
"
said
my
aunt
;
"
cent
per
cent
was
the
lowest
of
it
,
I
believe
;
but
the
Bank
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
,
and
tumbled
into
space
,
for
what
I
know
;
anyhow
,
it
fell
to
pieces
,
and
never
will
and
never
can
pay
sixpence
;
and
Betsey
's
sixpences
were
all
there
,
and
there
's
an
end
of
them
.
<EOS>
Least
said
,
soonest
mended
!
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
concluded
this
philosophical
summary
,
by
fixing
her
eyes
with
a
kind
of
triumph
on
Agnes
,
whose
colour
was
gradually
returning
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Miss
Trotwood
,
is
that
all
the
history
?
"
said
Agnes
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
's
enough
,
child
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
there
had
been
more
money
to
lose
,
it
would
n't
have
been
all
,
I
dare
say
.
 
<EOS>
Betsey
would
have
contrived
to
throw
that
after
the
rest
,
and
make
another
chapter
,
I
have
little
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
more
money
,
and
there
's
no
more
story
.
"
   
<EOS>
Agnes
had
listened
at
first
with
suspended
breath
.
 
<EOS>
Her
colour
still
came
and
went
,
but
she
breathed
more
freely
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
knew
why
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
she
had
had
some
fear
that
her
unhappy
father
might
be
in
some
way
to
blame
for
what
had
happened
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
took
her
hand
in
hers
,
and
laughed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
"
repeated
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
that
's
all
,
except
,
"
<EOS>
And
she
lived
happy
ever
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
may
add
that
of
Betsey
yet
,
one
of
these
days
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Agnes
,
you
have
a
wise
head
.
<EOS>
So
have
you
,
Trot
,
in
some
things
,
though
I
ca
n't
compliment
you
always
"
;
and
here
my
aunt
shook
her
own
at
me
,
with
an
energy
peculiar
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
to
be
done
?
 
<EOS>
Here
's
the
cottage
,
taking
one
time
with
another
,
will
produce
say
seventy
pounds
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
we
may
safely
put
it
down
at
that
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
---
That
's
all
we
've
got
,
"
said
my
aunt
;
with
whom
it
was
an
idiosyncrasy
,
as
it
is
with
some
horses
,
to
stop
very
short
when
she
appeared
to
be
in
a
fair
way
of
going
on
for
a
long
while
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
after
a
rest
,
"
there
's
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
good
for
a
hundred
a
-
year
,
but
of
course
that
must
be
expended
on
himself
.
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
send
him
away
,
though
I
know
I
am
the
only
person
who
appreciates
him
,
than
have
him
,
and
not
spend
his
money
on
himself
.
 
<EOS>
How
can
Trot
and
I
do
best
,
upon
our
means
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
,
Agnes
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
aunt
,
"
I
interposed
,
"
that
I
must
do
something
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Go
for
a
soldier
,
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
returned
my
aunt
,
alarmed
;
"
or
go
to
sea
?
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
hear
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
to
be
a
proctor
.
 
<EOS>
We
're
not
going
to
have
any
knockings
on
the
head
in
THIS
family
,
if
you
please
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
about
to
explain
that
I
was
not
desirous
of
introducing
that
mode
of
provision
into
the
family
,
when
Agnes
inquired
if
my
rooms
were
held
for
any
long
term
?
   
<EOS>
"
You
come
to
the
point
,
my
dear
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
not
to
be
got
rid
of
,
for
six
months
at
least
,
unless
they
could
be
underlet
,
and
that
I
do
n't
believe
.
 
<EOS>
The
last
man
died
here
.
 
<EOS>
Five
people
out
of
six
would
die
---
of
course
---
of
that
woman
in
nankeen
with
the
flannel
petticoat
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
little
ready
money
;
and
I
agree
with
you
,
the
best
thing
we
can
do
,
is
,
to
live
the
term
out
here
,
and
get
a
bedroom
hard
by
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
thought
it
my
duty
to
hint
at
the
discomfort
my
aunt
would
sustain
,
from
living
in
a
continual
state
of
guerilla
warfare
with
Mrs
Crupp
;
but
she
disposed
of
that
objection
summarily
by
declaring
that
,
on
the
first
demonstration
of
hostilities
,
she
was
prepared
to
astonish
Mrs
Crupp
for
the
whole
remainder
of
her
natural
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
thinking
,
Trotwood
,
"
said
Agnes
,
diffidently
,
"
that
if
you
had
time
---
"
   
"
I
have
a
good
deal
of
time
,
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
always
disengaged
after
four
or
five
o'clock
,
and
I
have
time
early
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
way
<EOS>
and
another
,
"
said
I
,
conscious
of
reddening
a
little
as
I
thought
of
the
hours
and
hours
<EOS>
I
had
devoted
to
fagging
about
town
,
and
to
and
fro
upon
the
Norwood
Road
,
"
I
have
abundance
of
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
would
not
mind
,
"
said
Agnes
,
coming
to
me
,
and
speaking
in
a
low
voice
,
so
full
of
sweet
and
hopeful
consideration
that
I
hear
it
now
,
"
the
duties
of
a
secretary
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mind
,
my
dear
Agnes
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
continued
Agnes
,
"
Doctor
Strong
has
acted
on
his
intention
of
retiring
,
and
has
come
to
live
in
London
;
and
he
asked
papa
,
I
know
,
if
he
could
recommend
him
one
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
he
would
rather
have
his
favourite
old
pupil
near
him
,
than
anybody
else
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Agnes
!
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
What
should
I
do
without
you
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
always
my
good
angel
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
you
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
think
of
you
in
any
other
light
.
"
   
<EOS>
Agnes
answered
with
her
pleasant
laugh
,
that
one
good
Angel
(
meaning
Dora
)
was
enough
;
and
went
on
to
remind
me
that
the
Doctor
had
been
used
to
occupy
himself
in
his
study
,
early
in
the
morning
,
and
in
the
evening
---
and
that
probably
my
leisure
would
suit
his
requirements
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
scarcely
more
delighted
with
the
prospect
of
earning
my
own
bread
,
than
with
the
hope
of
earning
it
under
my
old
master
;
in
short
,
acting
on
the
advice
of
Agnes
,
I
sat
down
and
wrote
a
letter
to
the
Doctor
,
stating
my
object
,
and
appointing
to
call
on
him
next
day
at
ten
in
the
forenoon
.
 
<EOS>
This
<EOS>
I
addressed
to
Highgate
---
for
in
that
place
,
so
memorable
to
me
,
he
lived
---
and
went
and
posted
,
myself
,
without
losing
a
minute
.
   
<EOS>
Wherever
Agnes
was
,
some
agreeable
token
of
her
noiseless
presence
<EOS>
seemed
inseparable
from
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
came
back
,
I
found
my
aunt
's
birds
hanging
,
just
as
they
had
hung
so
long
in
the
parlour
window
of
the
cottage
;
and
my
easy
-
chair
imitating
my
aunt
's
much
easier
chair
in
its
position
at
the
open
window
;
and
even
the
round
green
fan
,
which
my
aunt
had
brought
away
with
her
,
screwed
on
to
the
window
-
sill
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
who
had
done
all
this
,
by
its
seeming
to
have
quietly
done
itself
;
and
I
should
have
known
in
a
moment
who
had
arranged
my
neglected
books
in
the
old
order
of
my
school
days
,
even
if
I
had
supposed
Agnes
to
be
miles
away
,
instead
of
seeing
her
busy
with
them
,
and
smiling
at
the
disorder
into
which
they
had
fallen
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
was
quite
gracious
on
the
subject
of
the
Thames
<EOS>
(
it
really
did
look
very
well
with
the
sun
upon
it
,
though
not
like
the
sea
before
the
cottage
)
,
but
she
could
not
relent
towards
the
London
smoke
,
which
,
she
said
,
"
peppered
everything
"
.
 
<EOS>
A
complete
revolution
,
in
which
Peggotty
bore
a
prominent
part
,
was
being
effected
in
every
corner
of
my
rooms
,
in
regard
of
this
pepper
;
and
I
was
looking
on
,
thinking
how
little
even
Peggotty
seemed
to
do
with
a
good
deal
of
bustle
,
and
how
much
Agnes
did
without
any
bustle
at
all
,
when
a
knock
came
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
said
Agnes
,
turning
pale
,
"
it
's
papa
.
 
<EOS>
He
promised
me
that
he
would
come
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
opened
the
door
,
and
admitted
,
not
only
Mr
Wickfield
,
but
Uriah
Heep
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
not
seen
Mr
Wickfield
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
prepared
for
a
great
change
in
him
,
after
what
I
had
heard
from
Agnes
,
but
his
appearance
shocked
me
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
he
looked
many
years
older
,
though
still
dressed
with
the
old
scrupulous
cleanliness
;
or
that
there
was
an
unwholesome
ruddiness
upon
his
face
;
or
that
his
eyes
were
full
and
bloodshot
;
or
that
there
was
a
nervous
trembling
in
his
hand
,
the
cause
of
which
I
knew
,
and
had
for
some
years
seen
at
work
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
he
had
lost
his
good
looks
,
or
his
old
bearing
of
a
gentleman
---
for
that
he
had
not
---
but
the
thing
that
struck
me
most
,
was
,
that
with
the
evidences
of
his
native
superiority
still
upon
him
,
he
should
submit
himself
to
that
crawling
impersonation
of
meanness
,
Uriah
Heep
.
 
<EOS>
The
reversal
of
the
two
natures
,
in
their
relative
positions
,
Uriah
's
of
power
and
Mr
Wickfield
's
of
dependence
,
was
a
sight
more
painful
to
me
than
I
can
express
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
seen
an
Ape
taking
command
of
a
Man
,
I
should
hardly
have
thought
it
a
more
degrading
spectacle
.
   
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
be
only
too
conscious
of
it
himself
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
came
in
,
he
stood
still
;
and
with
his
head
bowed
,
as
if
he
felt
it
.
<EOS>
This
was
only
for
a
moment
;
for
Agnes
softly
said
to
him
,
"
Papa
!
<EOS>
Here
is
Miss
Trotwood
---
and
Trotwood
,
whom
you
have
not
seen
for
a
long
while
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
approached
,
and
constrainedly
gave
my
aunt
his
hand
,
and
shook
hands
more
cordially
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
moment
's
pause
I
speak
of
<EOS>
,
I
saw
Uriah
's
countenance
form
itself
into
a
most
ill
-
favoured
smile
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
saw
it
too
,
I
think
,
for
she
shrank
from
him
.
   
<EOS>
What
my
aunt
saw
,
or
did
not
see
,
I
defy
the
science
of
physiognomy
to
have
made
out
,
without
her
own
consent
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
there
never
was
anybody
with
such
an
imperturbable
countenance
when
she
chose
.
<EOS>
Her
face
might
have
been
a
dead
-
wall
on
the
occasion
in
question
,
for
any
light
it
threw
upon
her
thoughts
;
until
she
broke
silence
with
her
usual
abruptness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Wickfield
!
"
said
my
aunt
;
and
he
looked
up
at
her
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
telling
your
daughter
how
well
I
have
been
disposing
of
my
money
for
myself
,
because
I
could
n't
trust
it
to
you
,
as
you
were
growing
rusty
in
business
matters
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
been
taking
counsel
together
,
and
getting
on
very
well
,
all
things
considered
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
is
worth
the
whole
firm
,
in
my
opinion
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
may
umbly
make
the
remark
,
"
said
Uriah
Heep
,
with
a
writhe
,
"
I
fully
agree
with
Miss
Betsey
Trotwood
,
and
should
be
only
too
appy
if
Miss
Agnes
was
a
partner
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
partner
yourself
,
you
know
,
"
returned
my
aunt
,
"
and
that
's
about
enough
for
you
<EOS>
,
I
expect
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
find
yourself
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
In
acknowledgement
of
this
question
,
addressed
to
him
with
extraordinary
curtness
,
Mr
Heep
,
uncomfortably
clutching
the
blue
bag
he
carried
,
replied
that
he
was
pretty
well
,
he
thanked
my
aunt
,
and
hoped
she
was
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
,
Master
---
I
should
say
,
Mister
Copperfield
,
"
pursued
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
see
you
well
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
rejoiced
to
see
you
,
Mister
Copperfield
,
even
under
present
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
believed
that
;
for
he
seemed
to
relish
them
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
"
Present
circumstances
is
not
what
your
friends
would
wish
for
you
,
Mister
Copperfield
,
but
it
is
n't
money
makes
the
man
<EOS>
:
it
's
---
<EOS>
I
am
really
unequal
with
my
umble
powers
to
express
what
it
is
,
"
said
Uriah
,
with
a
fawning
jerk
,
"
but
it
is
n't
money
!
"
   
<EOS>
Here
he
shook
hands
with
me
:
not
in
the
common
way
,
but
standing
at
a
good
distance
from
me
,
and
lifting
my
hand
up
and
down
like
a
pump
handle
,
that
he
was
a
little
afraid
of
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
do
you
think
we
are
looking
,
Master
Copperfield
,
---
I
should
say
,
Mister
?
<EOS>
"
fawned
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
find
Mr
Wickfield
blooming
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Years
do
n't
tell
much
in
our
firm
,
Master
Copperfield
,
except
in
raising
up
the
umble
,
namely
,
mother
and
self
---
and
in
developing
,
"
he
added
,
as
an
afterthought
,
"
the
beautiful
,
namely
,
Miss
Agnes
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
jerked
himself
about
,
after
this
compliment
,
in
such
an
intolerable
manner
,
that
my
aunt
,
who
had
sat
looking
straight
at
him
,
lost
all
patience
.
   
<EOS>
"
Deuce
take
the
man
!
"
<EOS>
said
my
aunt
,
sternly
,
"
what
's
he
about
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
galvanic
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
"
returned
Uriah
;
"
I
'm
aware
you
're
nervous
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Go
along
with
you
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
said
my
aunt
,
anything
but
appeased
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
presume
to
say
so
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
nothing
of
the
sort
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
're
an
eel
,
sir
,
conduct
yourself
like
one
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
're
a
man
,
control
your
limbs
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
Good
God
!
"
said
my
aunt
,
with
great
indignation
,
"
I
am
not
going
to
be
serpentined
and
corkscrewed
out
of
my
senses
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Heep
was
rather
abashed
,
as
most
people
might
have
been
,
by
this
explosion
;
which
derived
great
additional
force
from
the
indignant
manner
in
which
my
aunt
afterwards
moved
in
her
chair
,
and
shook
her
head
as
if
she
were
making
snaps
or
bounces
at
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
said
to
me
aside
in
a
meek
voice
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
well
aware
,
Master
Copperfield
,
that
Miss
Trotwood
,
though
an
excellent
lady
,
has
a
quick
temper
(
indeed
I
think
I
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
her
,
when
I
was
a
numble
clerk
,
before
you
did
,
Master
Copperfield
)
,
and
it
's
only
natural
,
I
am
sure
,
that
it
should
be
made
quicker
by
present
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
The
wonder
is
,
that
it
is
n't
much
worse
!
 
<EOS>
I
only
called
to
say
that
if
there
was
anything
we
could
do
,
in
present
circumstances
,
mother
or
self
,
or
Wickfield
and
Heep
,
---
we
should
be
really
glad
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
go
so
far
?
<EOS>
"
said
Uriah
,
with
a
sickly
smile
at
his
partner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Uriah
Heep
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
,
in
a
monotonous
forced
way
,
"
is
active
in
the
business
,
Trotwood
.
 
<EOS>
What
he
says
,
I
quite
concur
in
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
had
an
old
interest
in
you
.
 
<EOS>
Apart
from
that
,
what
Uriah
says
I
quite
concur
in
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
a
reward
it
is
,
"
said
Uriah
,
drawing
up
one
leg
,
at
the
risk
of
bringing
down
upon
himself
another
visitation
from
my
aunt
,
"
to
be
so
trusted
in
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
hope
I
am
able
to
do
something
to
relieve
him
from
the
fatigues
of
business
,
Master
Copperfield
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Uriah
Heep
is
a
great
relief
to
me
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
,
in
the
same
dull
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
load
off
my
mind
,
Trotwood
,
to
have
such
a
partner
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
red
fox
made
him
say
all
this
,
I
knew
,
to
exhibit
him
to
me
in
the
light
he
had
indicated
on
the
night
when
he
poisoned
my
rest
.
<EOS>
I
saw
the
same
ill
-
favoured
smile
upon
his
face
again
,
and
saw
how
he
watched
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
going
,
papa
?
"
said
Agnes
,
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
not
walk
back
with
Trotwood
and
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
would
have
looked
to
Uriah
,
I
believe
,
before
replying
,
if
that
worthy
had
not
anticipated
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
bespoke
myself
,
"
said
Uriah
,
"
on
business
;
otherwise
I
should
have
been
appy
to
have
kept
with
my
friends
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
leave
my
partner
to
represent
the
firm
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Agnes
,
ever
yours
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
good
-
day
,
Master
Copperfield
,
and
leave
my
umble
respects
for
Miss
Betsey
Trotwood
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
those
words
,
he
retired
,
kissing
his
great
hand
,
and
leering
at
us
like
a
mask
.
   
<EOS>
We
sat
there
,
talking
about
our
pleasant
old
Canterbury
days
,
an
hour
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
,
left
to
Agnes
,
soon
became
more
like
his
former
self
;
though
there
was
a
settled
depression
upon
him
,
which
he
never
shook
off
.
 
<EOS>
For
all
that
,
he
brightened
;
and
had
an
evident
pleasure
in
hearing
us
recall
the
little
incidents
of
our
old
life
<EOS>
,
many
of
which
he
remembered
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
it
was
like
those
times
,
to
be
alone
with
Agnes
and
me
again
;
and
he
wished
to
Heaven
they
had
never
changed
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
there
was
an
influence
in
the
placid
face
of
Agnes
,
and
in
the
very
touch
of
her
hand
upon
his
arm
,
that
did
wonders
for
him
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
(
who
was
busy
nearly
all
this
while
with
Peggotty
,
in
the
inner
room
)
would
not
accompany
us
to
the
place
where
they
were
staying
,
but
insisted
on
my
going
;
and
I
went
.
 
<EOS>
We
dined
together
.
<EOS>
After
dinner
,
Agnes
sat
beside
him
,
as
of
old
,
and
poured
out
his
wine
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
what
she
gave
him
,
and
no
more
---
like
a
child
---
<EOS>
and
we
all
three
sat
together
at
a
window
as
the
evening
gathered
in
.
<EOS>
When
it
was
almost
dark
,
he
lay
down
on
a
sofa
,
Agnes
pillowing
his
head
and
bending
over
him
a
little
while
;
and
when
she
came
back
to
the
window
,
it
was
not
so
dark
<EOS>
but
I
could
see
tears
glittering
in
her
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
I
pray
Heaven
that
I
never
may
forget
the
dear
girl
in
her
love
and
truth
,
at
that
time
of
my
life
;
for
if
I
should
,
I
must
be
drawing
near
the
end
,
and
then
I
would
desire
to
remember
her
best
!
 
<EOS>
She
filled
my
heart
with
such
good
resolutions
,
strengthened
my
weakness
so
,
by
her
example
,
so
directed
---
I
know
not
how
,
she
was
too
modest
and
gentle
to
advise
me
in
many
words
---
the
wandering
ardour
and
unsettled
purpose
within
me
,
that
all
the
little
good
I
have
done
,
and
all
the
harm
I
have
forborne
,
I
solemnly
believe
I
may
refer
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
And
how
she
spoke
to
me
of
Dora
,
sitting
at
the
window
in
the
dark
;
listened
to
my
praises
of
her
;
praised
again
;
and
round
the
little
fairy
-
figure
shed
some
glimpses
of
her
own
pure
light
,
that
made
it
yet
more
precious
and
more
innocent
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Agnes
,
sister
of
my
boyhood
,
<EOS>
if
I
had
known
then
,
what
I
knew
long
afterwards
!
<EOS>
---
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
beggar
in
the
street
,
when
I
went
down
;
and
as
I
turned
my
head
towards
the
window
,
thinking
of
her
calm
seraphic
eyes
,
he
made
me
start
by
muttering
,
as
if
he
were
an
echo
of
the
morning
:
"
Blind
!
 
<EOS>
Blind
!
 
<EOS>
Blind
!

Chapter

.
<EOS>
Enthusiasm
 
<EOS>
I
began
the
next
day
with
another
dive
into
the
Roman
bath
,
and
then
started
for
Highgate
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
dispirited
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
afraid
of
the
shabby
coat
,
and
had
no
yearnings
after
gallant
greys
.
 
<EOS>
My
whole
manner
of
thinking
of
our
late
misfortune
was
changed
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
had
to
do
,
was
,
to
show
my
aunt
that
her
past
goodness
to
me
had
not
been
thrown
away
on
an
insensible
,
ungrateful
object
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
had
to
do
,
was
,
to
turn
the
painful
discipline
of
my
younger
days
to
account
,
by
going
to
work
with
a
resolute
and
steady
heart
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
had
to
do
,
was
,
to
take
my
woodman
's
axe
in
my
hand
,
and
clear
my
own
way
through
the
forest
of
difficulty
,
by
cutting
down
the
trees
until
I
came
to
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
went
on
at
a
mighty
rate
,
as
if
it
could
be
done
by
walking
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
found
myself
on
the
familiar
Highgate
road
,
pursuing
such
a
different
errand
from
that
old
one
of
pleasure
,
with
which
it
was
associated
,
it
seemed
as
if
a
complete
change
had
come
on
my
whole
life
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
did
not
discourage
me
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
new
life
,
came
new
purpose
,
new
intention
.
 
<EOS>
Great
was
the
labour
;
priceless
the
reward
.
 
<EOS>
Dora
was
the
reward
,
and
Dora
must
be
won
.
   
<EOS>
I
got
into
such
a
transport
,
that
I
felt
quite
sorry
<EOS>
my
coat
was
not
a
little
shabby
already
.
 
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
be
cutting
at
those
trees
in
the
forest
of
difficulty
,
under
circumstances
that
should
prove
my
strength
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
good
mind
to
ask
an
old
man
,
in
wire
spectacles
,
who
was
breaking
stones
upon
the
road
,
to
lend
me
his
hammer
for
a
little
while
,
and
let
me
begin
to
beat
a
path
to
Dora
out
of
granite
.
 
<EOS>
I
stimulated
myself
into
such
a
heat
,
and
got
so
out
of
breath
,
that
I
felt
as
if
I
had
been
earning
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
much
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
state
,
I
went
into
a
cottage
that
I
saw
was
to
let
,
and
examined
it
narrowly
,
---
for
I
felt
it
necessary
to
be
practical
.
<EOS>
It
would
do
for
me
and
Dora
admirably
:
with
a
little
front
garden
for
Jip
to
run
about
in
,
and
bark
at
the
tradespeople
through
the
railings
,
and
a
capital
room
upstairs
for
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
out
again
,
hotter
and
faster
than
ever
,
and
dashed
up
to
Highgate
,
at
such
a
rate
that
I
was
there
an
hour
too
early
;
and
,
though
I
had
not
been
,
should
have
been
obliged
to
stroll
about
to
cool
myself
,
before
I
was
at
all
presentable
.
   
<EOS>
My
first
care
,
after
putting
myself
under
this
necessary
course
of
preparation
,
was
to
find
the
Doctor
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
that
part
of
Highgate
where
Mrs
Steerforth
lived
,
but
quite
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
little
town
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
had
made
this
discovery
,
I
went
back
,
in
an
attraction
I
could
not
resist
,
to
a
lane
by
Mrs
Steerforth
's
,
and
looked
over
the
corner
of
the
garden
wall
.
 
<EOS>
His
room
was
shut
up
close
.
 
<EOS>
The
conservatory
doors
were
standing
open
,
and
Rosa
Dartle
was
walking
,
bareheaded
,
with
a
quick
,
impetuous
step
,
up
and
down
a
gravel
walk
on
one
side
of
the
lawn
.
 
<EOS>
She
gave
me
the
idea
of
some
fierce
thing
<EOS>
,
that
was
dragging
the
length
of
its
chain
to
and
fro
upon
a
beaten
track
,
and
wearing
its
heart
out
.
   
<EOS>
I
came
softly
away
from
my
place
of
observation
,
and
avoiding
that
part
of
the
neighbourhood
,
and
wishing
I
had
not
gone
near
it
,
strolled
about
until
it
was
ten
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
The
church
with
the
slender
spire
,
that
stands
on
the
top
of
the
hill
now
,
was
not
there
then
to
tell
me
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
An
old
red
-
brick
mansion
,
used
as
a
school
,
was
in
its
place
;
and
a
fine
old
house
it
must
have
been
to
go
to
school
at
,
as
I
recollect
it
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
approached
the
Doctor
's
cottage
---
a
pretty
old
place
,
on
which
he
seemed
to
have
expended
some
money
,
if
I
might
judge
from
the
embellishments
and
repairs
that
had
the
look
of
being
just
completed
---
I
saw
him
walking
in
the
garden
at
the
side
,
gaiters
and
all
,
as
if
he
had
never
left
off
walking
since
the
days
of
my
pupilage
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
his
old
companions
about
him
,
too
;
for
there
were
plenty
of
high
trees
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
two
or
three
rooks
were
on
the
grass
,
looking
after
him
,
as
if
they
had
been
written
to
about
him
by
the
Canterbury
rooks
,
and
were
observing
him
closely
in
consequence
.
   
<EOS>
Knowing
the
utter
hopelessness
of
attracting
his
attention
from
that
distance
,
I
made
bold
to
open
the
gate
,
and
walk
after
him
,
so
as
to
meet
him
when
he
should
turn
round
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
did
,
and
came
towards
me
,
he
looked
at
me
thoughtfully
for
a
few
moments
,
evidently
without
thinking
about
me
at
all
;
and
then
his
benevolent
face
expressed
extraordinary
pleasure
,
and
he
took
me
by
both
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
"
you
are
a
man
!
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
delighted
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Copperfield
,
how
very
much
you
have
improved
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
quite
---
<EOS>
yes
---
dear
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
hoped
he
was
well
,
and
Mrs
Strong
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
,
yes
!
"
said
the
Doctor
;
"
Annie
's
quite
well
,
and
she
'll
be
delighted
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
always
her
favourite
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
so
,
last
night
,
when
I
showed
her
your
letter
.
 
<EOS>
And
---
yes
,
to
be
sure
---
you
recollect
Mr
Jack
Maldon
,
Copperfield
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
said
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
pretty
well
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Has
he
come
home
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
From
India
?
"
said
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jack
Maldon
could
n't
bear
the
climate
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Markleham
---
you
have
not
forgotten
Mrs
Markleham
?
"
   
<EOS>
Forgotten
the
Old
Soldier
!
 
<EOS>
And
in
that
short
time
!
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Markleham
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
"
was
quite
vexed
about
him
,
poor
thing
;
so
we
have
got
him
at
home
again
;
and
we
have
bought
him
a
little
Patent
place
,
which
agrees
with
him
much
better
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
enough
of
Mr
Jack
Maldon
to
suspect
from
this
account
that
it
was
a
place
where
there
was
not
much
to
do
,
and
which
was
pretty
well
paid
.
 
<EOS>
The
Doctor
,
walking
up
and
down
with
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
and
his
kind
face
turned
encouragingly
to
mine
,
went
on
:
   
"
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
in
reference
to
this
proposal
of
yours
.
<EOS>
It
's
very
gratifying
and
agreeable
to
me
,
I
am
sure
;
but
do
n't
you
think
you
could
do
better
?
 
<EOS>
You
achieved
distinction
,
you
know
,
when
you
were
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
qualified
for
many
good
things
.
<EOS>
You
have
laid
a
foundation
that
any
edifice
may
be
raised
upon
;
and
is
it
not
a
pity
that
you
should
devote
the
spring
-
time
of
your
life
to
such
a
poor
pursuit
as
I
can
offer
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
became
very
glowing
again
,
and
,
expressing
myself
in
a
rhapsodical
style
<EOS>
,
I
am
afraid
,
urged
my
request
strongly
;
reminding
the
Doctor
that
I
had
already
a
profession
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
"
that
's
true
.
 
<EOS>
Certainly
,
your
having
a
profession
,
and
being
actually
engaged
in
studying
it
,
makes
a
difference
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
my
good
young
friend
,
what
's
seventy
pounds
a
year
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
doubles
our
income
,
Doctor
Strong
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
replied
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
think
of
that
!
 
<EOS>
Not
that
I
mean
to
say
it
's
rigidly
limited
to
seventy
pounds
a
-
year
,
because
I
have
always
contemplated
making
any
young
friend
<EOS>
I
might
thus
employ
,
a
present
too
.
 
<EOS>
Undoubtedly
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
still
walking
me
up
and
down
with
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
taken
an
annual
present
into
account
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
tutor
,
"
said
I
(
now
,
really
,
without
any
nonsense
)
,
"
to
whom
I
owe
more
obligations
already
than
I
ever
can
acknowledge
---
"
   
"
No
,
no
,
"
interposed
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
take
such
time
as
I
have
,
and
that
is
my
mornings
and
evenings
,
and
can
think
it
worth
seventy
pounds
a
year
,
you
will
do
me
such
a
service
as
I
can
not
express
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
said
the
Doctor
,
innocently
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
think
that
so
little
should
go
for
so
much
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
!
 
<EOS>
And
when
you
can
do
better
,
you
will
?
 
<EOS>
On
your
word
,
now
?
"
said
the
Doctor
,
---
which
he
had
always
made
a
very
grave
appeal
to
the
honour
of
us
boys
.
   
<EOS>
"
On
my
word
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
I
returned
,
answering
in
our
old
school
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
be
it
so
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
clapping
me
on
the
shoulder
,
and
still
keeping
his
hand
there
,
as
we
still
walked
up
and
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
shall
be
twenty
times
happier
,
sir
,
"
said
I
,
with
a
little
---
I
hope
innocent
---
flattery
,
"
if
my
employment
is
to
be
on
the
Dictionary
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
stopped
,
smilingly
clapped
me
on
the
shoulder
again
,
and
exclaimed
,
with
a
triumph
most
delightful
to
behold
,
as
if
I
had
penetrated
to
the
profoundest
depths
of
mortal
sagacity
,
"
My
dear
young
friend
,
you
have
hit
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
IS
the
Dictionary
!
"
   
<EOS>
How
could
it
be
anything
else
!
 
<EOS>
His
pockets
were
as
full
of
it
as
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
sticking
out
of
him
in
all
directions
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
that
since
his
retirement
from
scholastic
life
,
he
had
been
advancing
with
it
wonderfully
;
and
that
nothing
could
suit
him
better
than
the
proposed
arrangements
for
morning
and
evening
work
,
as
it
was
his
custom
to
walk
about
in
the
daytime
with
his
considering
cap
on
.
 
<EOS>
His
papers
were
in
a
little
confusion
,
in
consequence
of
Mr
Jack
Maldon
having
lately
proffered
his
occasional
services
as
an
amanuensis
,
and
not
being
accustomed
to
that
occupation
;
but
we
should
soon
put
right
<EOS>
what
was
amiss
,
and
go
on
swimmingly
.
 
<EOS>
Afterwards
,
when
we
were
fairly
at
our
work
,
I
found
Mr
Jack
Maldon
's
efforts
more
troublesome
to
me
than
I
had
expected
,
as
he
had
not
confined
himself
to
making
numerous
mistakes
,
but
had
sketched
so
many
soldiers
,
and
ladies
'
heads
,
over
the
Doctor
's
manuscript
,
that
I
often
became
involved
in
labyrinths
of
obscurity
.
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
was
quite
happy
in
the
prospect
of
our
going
to
work
together
on
that
wonderful
performance
,
and
we
settled
to
begin
next
morning
at
seven
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
to
work
two
hours
every
morning
,
and
two
or
three
hours
every
night
,
except
on
Saturdays
,
when
I
was
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
On
Sundays
,
of
course
,
I
was
to
rest
also
,
and
I
considered
these
very
easy
terms
.
   
<EOS>
Our
plans
being
thus
arranged
to
our
mutual
satisfaction
,
the
Doctor
took
me
into
the
house
to
present
me
to
Mrs
Strong
,
whom
we
found
in
the
Doctor
's
new
study
,
dusting
his
books
,
---
a
freedom
which
he
never
permitted
anybody
else
to
take
with
those
sacred
favourites
.
   
<EOS>
They
had
postponed
their
breakfast
on
my
account
,
and
we
sat
down
to
table
together
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
not
been
seated
long
,
when
I
saw
an
approaching
arrival
in
Mrs
Strong
's
face
,
before
I
heard
any
sound
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
gentleman
on
horseback
came
to
the
gate
,
and
leading
his
horse
into
the
little
court
,
with
the
bridle
over
his
arm
,
as
if
he
were
quite
at
home
,
tied
him
to
a
ring
in
the
empty
coach
-
house
wall
,
and
came
into
the
breakfast
parlour
,
whip
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Mr
Jack
Maldon
;
and
Mr
Jack
Maldon
was
not
at
all
improved
by
India
,
I
thought
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
in
a
state
of
ferocious
virtue
,
however
,
as
to
young
men
who
were
not
cutting
down
trees
in
the
forest
of
difficulty
;
and
my
impression
must
be
received
with
due
allowance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Jack
!
"
said
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jack
Maldon
shook
hands
with
me
;
but
not
very
warmly
,
I
believed
;
and
with
an
air
of
languid
patronage
,
at
which
I
secretly
took
great
umbrage
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
languor
altogether
was
quite
a
wonderful
sight
;
except
when
he
addressed
himself
to
his
cousin
Annie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
breakfasted
this
morning
,
Mr
Jack
?
"
said
the
Doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
ever
take
breakfast
,
sir
,
"
he
replied
,
with
his
head
thrown
back
in
an
easy
-
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
find
it
bores
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
news
today
?
"
inquired
the
Doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
at
all
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Maldon
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
an
account
about
the
people
being
hungry
and
discontented
down
in
the
North
,
but
they
are
always
being
hungry
and
discontented
somewhere
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
looked
grave
,
and
said
,
as
though
he
wished
to
change
the
subject
,
"
Then
there
's
no
news
at
all
;
and
no
news
,
they
say
,
is
good
news
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
long
statement
in
the
papers
,
sir
,
about
a
murder
,
"
observed
Mr
Maldon
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
somebody
is
always
being
murdered
,
and
I
did
n't
read
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
display
of
indifference
to
all
the
actions
and
passions
of
mankind
was
not
supposed
to
be
such
a
distinguished
quality
at
that
time
,
I
think
,
as
I
have
observed
it
to
be
considered
since
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
known
it
very
fashionable
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
it
displayed
with
such
success
,
that
I
have
encountered
some
fine
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
might
as
well
have
been
born
caterpillars
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
impressed
me
the
more
then
,
because
it
was
new
to
me
,
but
it
certainly
did
not
tend
to
exalt
my
opinion
of
,
or
to
strengthen
my
confidence
in
,
Mr
Jack
Maldon
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
came
out
to
inquire
whether
Annie
would
like
to
go
to
the
opera
tonight
,
"
said
Mr
Maldon
,
turning
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
last
good
night
<EOS>
there
will
be
,
this
season
;
and
there
's
a
singer
there
,
whom
she
really
ought
to
hear
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
perfectly
exquisite
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
which
,
she
is
so
charmingly
ugly
,
"
relapsing
into
languor
.
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
,
ever
pleased
with
what
was
likely
to
please
his
young
wife
,
turned
to
her
and
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
go
,
Annie
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
go
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not
,
"
she
said
to
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
prefer
to
remain
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
much
rather
remain
at
home
.
"
   
<EOS>
Without
looking
at
her
cousin
,
she
then
addressed
me
,
and
asked
me
about
Agnes
,
and
whether
she
should
see
her
,
and
whether
she
was
not
likely
to
come
that
day
;
and
was
so
much
disturbed
,
that
I
wondered
how
even
the
Doctor
,
buttering
his
toast
,
could
be
blind
to
what
was
so
obvious
.
   
<EOS>
But
he
saw
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
her
,
good
-
naturedly
,
that
she
was
young
and
ought
to
be
amused
and
entertained
,
and
must
not
allow
herself
to
be
made
dull
by
a
dull
old
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
Moreover
,
he
said
,
he
wanted
to
hear
her
sing
all
the
new
singer
's
songs
to
him
;
and
how
could
she
do
that
well
,
unless
she
went
?
 
<EOS>
So
the
Doctor
persisted
in
making
the
engagement
for
her
,
and
Mr
Jack
Maldon
was
to
come
back
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
This
concluded
,
he
went
to
his
Patent
place
,
I
suppose
;
<EOS>
but
at
all
events
went
away
on
his
horse
,
looking
very
idle
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
curious
to
find
out
next
morning
,
whether
she
had
been
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
not
,
but
had
sent
into
London
to
put
her
cousin
off
;
and
had
gone
out
in
the
afternoon
to
see
Agnes
,
and
had
prevailed
upon
the
Doctor
to
go
with
her
;
and
they
had
walked
home
by
the
fields
,
the
Doctor
told
me
,
the
evening
being
delightful
.
 
<EOS>
I
wondered
then
,
whether
she
would
have
gone
if
Agnes
had
not
been
in
town
,
and
whether
Agnes
had
some
good
influence
over
her
too
!
   
<EOS>
She
did
not
look
very
happy
,
I
thought
;
but
it
was
a
good
face
,
or
a
very
false
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
glanced
at
it
,
for
she
sat
in
the
window
all
the
time
we
were
at
work
;
and
made
our
breakfast
,
which
we
took
by
snatches
as
we
were
employed
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
left
,
at
nine
o'clock
,
she
was
kneeling
on
the
ground
at
the
Doctor
's
feet
,
putting
on
his
shoes
and
gaiters
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
softened
shade
upon
her
face
,
thrown
from
some
green
leaves
overhanging
the
open
window
of
the
low
room
;
and
I
thought
all
the
way
to
Doctors
'
Commons
,
of
the
night
when
I
had
seen
it
looking
at
him
as
he
read
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
pretty
busy
now
;
up
at
five
in
the
morning
,
and
home
at
nine
or
ten
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
had
infinite
satisfaction
in
being
so
closely
engaged
,
and
never
walked
slowly
on
any
account
,
and
felt
enthusiastically
that
the
more
I
tired
myself
,
the
more
I
was
doing
to
deserve
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
not
revealed
myself
in
my
altered
character
to
Dora
yet
,
because
she
was
coming
to
see
Miss
Mills
in
a
few
days
,
and
I
deferred
all
I
had
to
tell
her
until
then
;
merely
informing
her
in
my
letters
(
all
our
communications
were
secretly
forwarded
through
Miss
Mills
)
,
that
I
had
much
to
tell
her
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
I
put
myself
on
a
short
allowance
of
bear
's
grease
,
wholly
abandoned
scented
soap
and
lavender
water
,
and
sold
off
three
waistcoats
at
a
prodigious
sacrifice
,
as
being
too
luxurious
for
my
stern
career
.
   
<EOS>
Not
satisfied
with
all
these
proceedings
,
but
burning
with
impatience
to
do
something
more
,
I
went
to
see
Traddles
,
now
lodging
up
behind
the
parapet
of
a
house
in
Castle
Street
,
Holborn
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
,
who
had
been
with
me
to
Highgate
twice
already
,
and
had
resumed
his
companionship
with
the
Doctor
,
I
took
with
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
took
Mr
Dick
with
me
,
because
,
acutely
sensitive
to
my
aunt
's
reverses
,
and
sincerely
believing
that
no
galley
-
slave
or
convict
worked
as
I
did
,
he
had
begun
to
fret
and
worry
himself
out
of
spirits
and
appetite
,
as
having
nothing
useful
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
condition
,
he
felt
more
incapable
of
finishing
the
Memorial
than
ever
;
and
the
harder
he
worked
at
it
,
the
oftener
that
unlucky
head
of
King
Charles
<EOS>
the
First
got
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
Seriously
apprehending
that
his
malady
would
increase
,
unless
we
put
some
innocent
deception
upon
him
and
caused
him
to
believe
that
he
was
useful
,
or
unless
we
could
put
him
in
the
way
of
being
really
useful
(
which
would
be
better
)
,
I
made
up
my
mind
to
try
if
Traddles
could
help
us
.
<EOS>
Before
we
went
,
I
wrote
Traddles
a
full
statement
of
all
that
had
happened
,
and
Traddles
wrote
me
back
a
capital
answer
,
expressive
of
his
sympathy
and
friendship
.
   
<EOS>
We
found
him
hard
at
work
with
his
inkstand
and
papers
,
refreshed
by
the
sight
of
the
flower
-
pot
stand
and
the
little
round
table
in
a
corner
of
the
small
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
He
received
us
cordially
,
and
made
friends
with
Mr
Dick
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
professed
an
absolute
certainty
of
having
seen
him
before
,
and
we
both
said
,
"
Very
likely
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
first
subject
on
which
I
had
to
consult
Traddles
was
this
<EOS>
,
---
I
had
heard
that
many
men
distinguished
in
various
pursuits
had
begun
life
by
reporting
the
debates
in
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
having
mentioned
newspapers
to
me
,
as
one
of
his
hopes
,
I
had
put
the
two
things
together
,
and
told
Traddles
in
my
letter
that
I
wished
to
know
how
I
could
qualify
myself
for
this
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
now
informed
me
,
as
the
result
of
his
inquiries
,
that
the
mere
mechanical
acquisition
necessary
,
except
in
rare
cases
,
for
thorough
excellence
in
it
,
that
is
to
say
,
a
perfect
and
entire
command
of
the
mystery
of
short
-
hand
writing
and
reading
,
was
about
equal
in
difficulty
to
the
mastery
of
six
languages
;
and
that
it
might
perhaps
be
attained
,
by
dint
of
perseverance
,
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
reasonably
supposed
that
this
would
settle
the
business
;
but
I
,
only
feeling
that
here
indeed
were
a
few
tall
trees
to
be
hewn
down
,
immediately
resolved
to
work
my
way
on
to
Dora
through
this
thicket
,
axe
in
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
my
dear
Traddles
!
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
begin
tomorrow
.
"
   
<EOS>
Traddles
looked
astonished
,
as
he
well
might
;
but
he
had
no
notion
as
yet
of
my
rapturous
condition
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
buy
a
book
,
"
said
I
,
"
with
a
good
scheme
of
this
art
in
it
;
I
'll
work
at
it
at
the
Commons
,
where
I
have
n't
half
enough
to
do
;
I
'll
take
down
the
speeches
in
our
court
for
practice
---
<EOS>
Traddles
,
my
dear
fellow
,
I
'll
master
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
"
said
Traddles
,
opening
his
eyes
,
"
I
had
no
idea
you
were
such
a
determined
character
,
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
he
should
have
had
,
for
it
was
new
enough
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
passed
that
off
,
and
brought
Mr
Dick
on
the
carpet
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
wistfully
,
"
if
I
could
exert
myself
,
<EOS>
Mr
Traddles
---
if
I
could
beat
a
drum
---
or
blow
anything
!
"
   
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
little
doubt
he
would
have
preferred
such
an
employment
in
his
heart
to
all
others
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
,
who
would
not
have
smiled
for
the
world
,
replied
composedly
:
   
"
<EOS>
But
you
are
a
very
good
penman
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
told
me
so
,
Copperfield
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Excellent
!
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
And
indeed
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
wrote
with
extraordinary
neatness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
think
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
you
could
copy
writings
,
sir
,
if
I
got
them
for
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
looked
doubtfully
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
Trotwood
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
shook
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
shook
his
,
and
sighed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
about
the
Memorial
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
.
   
<EOS>
I
explained
to
Traddles
that
there
was
a
difficulty
in
keeping
King
Charles
the
First
out
of
Mr
Dick
's
manuscripts
;
Mr
Dick
in
the
meanwhile
looking
very
deferentially
and
seriously
at
Traddles
,
and
sucking
his
thumb
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
these
writings
,
you
know
,
that
I
speak
of
,
are
already
drawn
up
and
finished
,
"
said
Traddles
after
a
little
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dick
has
nothing
to
do
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
Would
n't
that
make
a
difference
,
Copperfield
?
 
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
would
n't
it
be
well
to
try
?
"
   
<EOS>
This
gave
us
new
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
and
<EOS>
I
laying
our
heads
together
apart
,
while
Mr
Dick
anxiously
watched
us
from
his
chair
,
we
concocted
a
scheme
in
virtue
of
which
we
got
him
to
work
next
day
,
with
triumphant
success
.
   
<EOS>
On
a
table
by
the
window
in
Buckingham
Street
,
we
set
out
the
work
Traddles
procured
for
him
---
which
was
to
make
<EOS>
,
I
forget
how
many
copies
of
a
legal
document
about
some
right
of
way
---
and
on
another
table
we
spread
the
last
unfinished
original
of
the
great
Memorial
.
<EOS>
Our
instructions
to
Mr
Dick
were
that
he
should
copy
exactly
what
he
had
before
him
,
without
the
least
departure
from
the
original
;
and
that
when
he
felt
it
necessary
to
make
the
slightest
allusion
to
King
Charles
<EOS>
the
First
,
he
should
fly
to
the
Memorial
.
 
<EOS>
We
exhorted
him
to
be
resolute
in
this
,
and
left
my
aunt
to
observe
him
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
reported
to
us
,
afterwards
,
that
,
at
first
,
he
was
like
a
man
playing
the
kettle
-
drums
,
and
constantly
divided
his
attentions
between
the
two
;
but
that
,
finding
this
confuse
and
fatigue
him
,
and
having
his
copy
there
,
plainly
before
his
eyes
,
he
soon
sat
at
it
in
an
orderly
business
-
like
manner
,
and
postponed
the
Memorial
to
a
more
convenient
time
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
although
we
took
great
care
that
he
should
have
no
more
to
do
than
was
good
for
him
,
and
although
he
did
not
begin
with
the
beginning
of
a
week
,
he
earned
by
the
following
Saturday
night
ten
shillings
and
nine
-
pence
;
and
never
,
<EOS>
while
I
live
,
shall
I
forget
his
going
about
to
all
the
shops
in
the
neighbourhood
to
change
this
treasure
into
sixpences
,
or
his
bringing
them
to
my
aunt
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
heart
upon
a
waiter
,
with
tears
of
joy
and
pride
in
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
like
one
under
the
propitious
influence
of
a
charm
,
from
the
moment
of
his
being
usefully
employed
;
and
if
there
were
a
happy
man
in
the
world
,
that
Saturday
night
,
it
was
the
grateful
creature
who
thought
my
aunt
the
most
wonderful
woman
in
existence
,
and
me
the
most
wonderful
young
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
starving
now
,
Trotwood
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
shaking
hands
with
me
in
a
corner
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
provide
for
her
,
Sir
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
flourished
his
ten
fingers
in
the
air
,
as
if
they
were
ten
banks
.
   
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
which
was
the
better
pleased
,
Traddles
or
I.
 
<EOS>
"
It
really
,
"
said
Traddles
,
suddenly
,
taking
a
letter
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
giving
it
to
me
,
"
put
Mr
Micawber
quite
out
of
my
head
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
letter
<EOS>
(
Mr
Micawber
never
missed
any
possible
opportunity
of
writing
a
letter
)
was
addressed
to
me
,
"
By
the
kindness
of
T
Traddles
,
Esquire
,
of
the
Inner
Temple
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
ran
thus
:
---
  
<EOS>
"
MY
DEAR
COPPERFIELD
,
"
   
"
You
may
possibly
not
be
unprepared
to
receive
the
intimation
that
something
has
turned
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
mentioned
to
you
on
a
former
occasion
that
I
was
in
expectation
of
such
an
event
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
about
to
establish
myself
in
one
of
the
provincial
towns
of
our
favoured
island
(
where
the
society
may
be
described
as
a
happy
admixture
of
the
agricultural
and
the
clerical
)
,
in
immediate
connexion
with
one
of
the
learned
professions
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
and
our
offspring
will
accompany
me
.
 
<EOS>
Our
ashes
,
at
a
future
period
,
will
probably
be
found
commingled
in
the
cemetery
attached
to
a
venerable
pile
,
for
which
the
spot
to
which
I
refer
has
acquired
a
reputation
,
shall
I
say
from
China
to
Peru
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
bidding
adieu
to
the
modern
Babylon
,
where
we
have
undergone
many
vicissitudes
,
I
trust
not
ignobly
,
Mrs
Micawber
and
myself
can
not
disguise
from
our
minds
that
we
part
,
it
may
be
for
years
and
it
may
be
for
ever

with
an
individual
linked
by
strong
associations
to
the
altar
of
our
domestic
life

<EOS>
If
,
on
the
eve
of
such
a
departure
,
you
will
accompany
our
mutual
friend
,
Mr
Thomas
Traddles
,
to
our
present
abode

there
reciprocate
the
wishes
natural
to
the
occasion

you
will
confer
a
Boon

WILKINS
MICAWBER
.
"
    
<EOS>
I
was
glad
to
find
that
Mr
Micawber
had
got
rid
of
his
dust
and
ashes
,
and
that
something
really
had
turned
up
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
Learning
from
Traddles
that
the
invitation
referred
to
the
evening
then
wearing
away
,
I
expressed
my
readiness
to
do
honour
to
it
;
and
we
went
off
together
to
the
lodging
which
Mr
Micawber
occupied
as
Mr
Mortimer
,
and
which
was
situated
near
the
top
of
the
Gray
's
Inn
Road
.
   
<EOS>
The
resources
of
this
lodging
were
so
limited
,
that
we
found
the
twins
,
now
some
eight
or
nine
years
old
,
reposing
in
a
turn
-
up
bedstead
in
the
family
sitting
-
room
,
where
Mr
Micawber
had
prepared
,
in
a
wash
-
hand
-
stand
jug
<EOS>
,
what
he
called
"
a
Brew
"
of
the
agreeable
beverage
for
which
he
was
famous
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
the
pleasure
,
on
this
occasion
,
of
renewing
the
acquaintance
of
Master
Micawber
,
whom
I
found
a
promising
boy
of
about
twelve
or
thirteen
,
very
subject
to
that
restlessness
of
limb
which
is
not
an
unfrequent
phenomenon
in
youths
of
his
age
.
 
<EOS>
I
also
became
once
more
known
to
his
sister
,
Miss
Micawber
,
in
whom
,
as
Mr
Micawber
told
us
,
"
her
mother
renewed
her
youth
,
like
the
Phoenix
"
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
yourself
and
Mr
Traddles
find
us
on
the
brink
of
migration
,
and
will
excuse
any
little
discomforts
incidental
to
that
position
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Glancing
round
as
I
made
a
suitable
reply
<EOS>
,
I
observed
that
the
family
effects
were
already
packed
,
and
that
the
amount
of
luggage
was
by
no
means
overwhelming
.
 
<EOS>
I
congratulated
Mrs
Micawber
on
the
approaching
change
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
of
your
friendly
interest
in
all
our
affairs
,
I
am
well
assured
.
 
<EOS>
My
family
may
consider
it
banishment
,
if
they
please
;
but
I
am
a
wife
and
mother
,
and
I
never
will
desert
Mr
Micawber
.
"
   
<EOS>
Traddles
,
appealed
to
by
Mrs
Micawber
's
eye
,
feelingly
acquiesced
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
that
,
at
least
,
is
my
view
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
and
Mr
Traddles
,
of
the
obligation
which
I
took
upon
myself
when
I
repeated
the
irrevocable
words
,
"
I

Emma

take
thee

I
read
the
service
over
with
a
flat

candle
on
the
previous
night
,
and
the
conclusion
I
derived
from
it
was
,
that
I
never
could
desert
Mr
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
though
it
is
possible
<EOS>
I
may
be
mistaken
in
my
view
of
the
ceremony
,
I
never
will
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
a
little
impatiently
,
"
I
am
not
conscious
that
you
are
expected
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
aware
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
pursued
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
that
I
am
now
about
to
cast
my
lot
among
strangers
;
and
I
am
also
aware
that
the
various
members
of
my
family
,
to
whom
Mr
Micawber
has
written
in
the
most
gentlemanly
terms
,
announcing
that
fact
,
have
not
taken
the
least
notice
of
Mr
Micawber
's
communication
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
I
may
be
superstitious
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
but
it
appears
to
me
that
Mr
Micawber
is
destined
never
to
receive
any
answers
whatever
to
the
great
majority
of
the
communications
he
writes
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
augur
,
from
the
silence
of
my
family
,
that
they
object
to
the
resolution
I
have
taken
;
but
I
should
not
allow
myself
to
be
swerved
from
the
path
of
duty
,
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
even
by
my
papa
and
mama
,
were
they
still
living
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
expressed
my
opinion
that
this
was
going
in
the
right
direction
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
a
sacrifice
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
to
immure
one's
-
self
in
a
Cathedral
town
;
but
surely
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
if
it
is
a
sacrifice
in
me
,
it
is
much
more
a
sacrifice
in
a
man
of
Mr
Micawber
's
abilities
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
going
to
a
Cathedral
town
?
"
said
I.
   
Mr
Micawber
,
who
had
been
helping
us
all
,
out
of
the
wash
-
hand
-
stand
jug
,
replied
:
   
"
To
Canterbury
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
I
have
entered
into
arrangements
,
by
virtue
of
which
I
stand
pledged
and
contracted
to
our
friend
Heep
,
to
assist
and
serve
him
in
the
capacity
of
---
and
to
be
---
his
confidential
clerk
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
stared
at
Mr
Micawber
,
who
greatly
enjoyed
my
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
bound
to
state
to
you
,
"
he
said
,
with
an
official
air
,
"
that
the
business
habits
,
and
the
prudent
suggestions
,
of
Mrs
Micawber
,
have
in
a
great
measure
conduced
to
this
result
.
 
<EOS>
The
gauntlet
,
to
which
Mrs
Micawber
referred
upon
a
former
occasion
,
being
thrown
down
in
the
form
of
an
advertisement
,
was
taken
up
by
my
friend
Heep
,
and
led
to
a
mutual
recognition
.
 
<EOS>
Of
my
friend
Heep
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
who
is
a
man
of
remarkable
shrewdness
,
I
desire
to
speak
with
all
possible
respect
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
Heep
has
not
fixed
the
positive
remuneration
at
too
high
a
figure
,
but
he
has
made
a
great
deal
,
in
the
way
of
extrication
from
the
pressure
of
pecuniary
difficulties
,
contingent
on
the
value
of
my
services
;
and
on
the
value
of
those
services
I
pin
my
faith
.
 
<EOS>
Such
address
and
intelligence
as
I
chance
to
possess
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
boastfully
disparaging
himself
,
with
the
old
genteel
air
,
"
will
be
devoted
to
my
friend
Heep
's
service
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
already
some
acquaintance
with
the
law
---
as
a
defendant
on
civil
process
---
and
I
shall
immediately
apply
myself
to
the
Commentaries
of
one
of
the
most
eminent
and
remarkable
of
our
English
jurists
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
it
is
unnecessary
to
add
that
I
allude
to
Mr
justice
Blackstone
.
"
   
<EOS>
These
observations
,
and
indeed
the
greater
part
of
the
observations
made
that
evening
,
were
interrupted
by
Mrs
Micawber
's
discovering
that
Master
Micawber
was
sitting
on
his
boots
,
or
holding
his
head
on
with
both
arms
as
if
he
felt
it
loose
,
or
accidentally
kicking
Traddles
under
the
table
,
or
shuffling
his
feet
over
one
another
,
or
producing
them
at
distances
from
himself
apparently
outrageous
to
nature
,
or
lying
sideways
with
his
hair
among
the
wine
-
glasses
,
or
developing
his
restlessness
of
limb
in
some
other
form
incompatible
with
the
general
interests
of
society
;
and
by
Master
Micawber
's
receiving
those
discoveries
in
a
resentful
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
all
the
while
,
amazed
by
Mr
Micawber
's
disclosure
,
and
wondering
what
it
meant
;
until
Mrs
Micawber
resumed
the
thread
of
the
discourse
,
and
claimed
my
attention
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
I
particularly
request
Mr
Micawber
to
be
careful
of
,
is
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
that
he
does
not
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
in
applying
himself
to
this
subordinate
branch
of
the
law
,
place
it
out
of
his
power
to
rise
,
ultimately
,
to
the
top
of
the
tree
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
convinced
that
Mr
Micawber
,
giving
his
mind
to
a
profession
so
adapted
to
his
fertile
resources
,
and
his
flow
of
language
,
must
distinguish
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
for
example
,
Mr
Traddles
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
assuming
a
profound
air
,
"
a
judge
,
or
even
say
a
Chancellor
.
 
<EOS>
Does
an
individual
place
himself
beyond
the
pale
of
those
preferments
by
entering
on
such
an
office
as
Mr
Micawber
has
accepted
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
observed
Mr
Micawber
---
but
glancing
inquisitively
at
Traddles
,
too
;
"
we
have
time
enough
before
us
,
for
the
consideration
of
those
questions
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Micawber
,
"
she
returned
,
"
no
!
 
<EOS>
Your
mistake
in
life
is
,
that
you
do
not
look
forward
far
enough
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
bound
,
in
justice
to
your
family
,
if
not
to
yourself
,
to
take
in
at
a
comprehensive
glance
the
extremest
point
in
the
horizon
to
which
your
abilities
may
lead
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
coughed
,
and
drank
his
punch
with
an
air
of
exceeding
satisfaction
---
still
glancing
at
Traddles
,
as
if
he
desired
to
have
his
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
plain
state
of
the
case
,
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
said
Traddles
,
mildly
breaking
the
truth
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
the
real
prosaic
fact
,
you
know
---
"
   
"
Just
so
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
my
dear
Mr
Traddles
,
I
wish
to
be
as
prosaic
and
literal
as
possible
on
a
subject
of
so
much
importance
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
---
Is
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
that
this
branch
of
the
law
,
even
if
Mr
Micawber
were
a
regular
solicitor
---
"
   
"
Exactly
so
,
"
returned
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
(
"
Wilkins
,
you
are
squinting
,
and
will
not
be
able
to
get
your
eyes
back
.
"
)
   
"
<EOS>
---
Has
nothing
,
"
pursued
Traddles
,
"
to
do
with
that
.
 
<EOS>
Only
a
barrister
is
eligible
for
such
preferments
;
and
Mr
Micawber
could
not
be
a
barrister
,
without
being
entered
at
an
inn
of
court
as
a
student
,
for
five
years
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
I
follow
you
?
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
with
her
most
affable
air
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
I
understand
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Mr
Traddles
,
that
,
at
the
expiration
of
that
period
,
Mr
Micawber
would
be
eligible
as
a
Judge
or
Chancellor
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
would
be
ELIGIBLE
,
"
returned
Traddles
,
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
that
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
quite
sufficient
.
 
<EOS>
If
such
is
the
case
,
and
Mr
Micawber
forfeits
no
privilege
by
entering
on
these
duties
,
my
anxiety
is
set
at
rest
.
 
<EOS>
I
speak
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
as
a
female
,
necessarily
;
but
I
have
always
been
of
opinion
that
Mr
Micawber
possesses
what
I
have
heard
my
papa
call
,
when
I
lived
at
home
,
the
judicial
mind
;
and
<EOS>
I
hope
Mr
Micawber
is
now
entering
on
a
field
where
that
mind
will
develop
itself
,
and
take
a
commanding
station
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
quite
believe
that
Mr
Micawber
saw
himself
,
in
his
judicial
mind
's
eye
,
on
the
woolsack
.
 
<EOS>
He
passed
his
hand
complacently
over
his
bald
head
,
and
said
with
ostentatious
resignation
:
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
we
will
not
anticipate
the
decrees
of
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
am
reserved
to
wear
a
wig
,
I
am
at
least
prepared
,
externally
,
"
in
allusion
to
his
baldness
,
"
for
that
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
regret
my
hair
,
and
I
may
have
been
deprived
of
it
for
a
specific
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
my
intention
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
to
educate
my
son
for
the
Church
;
I
will
not
deny
that
I
should
be
happy
,
on
his
account
,
to
attain
to
eminence
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
For
the
Church
?
"
said
I
,
still
pondering
,
between
whiles
,
on
Uriah
Heep
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
a
remarkable
head
-
voice
,
and
will
commence
as
a
chorister
.
 
<EOS>
Our
residence
at
Canterbury
,
and
our
local
connexion
,
will
,
no
doubt
,
enable
him
to
take
advantage
of
any
vacancy
that
may
arise
in
the
Cathedral
corps
.
"
   
<EOS>
On
looking
at
Master
Micawber
again
,
I
saw
that
he
had
a
certain
expression
of
face
,
<EOS>
as
if
his
voice
were
behind
his
eyebrows
;
where
it
presently
appeared
to
be
,
on
his
singing
us
(
as
an
alternative
between
that
and
bed
)
<EOS>
"
The
Wood
-
Pecker
tapping
"
.
 
<EOS>
After
many
compliments
on
this
performance
,
we
fell
into
some
general
conversation
;
and
as
I
was
too
full
of
my
desperate
intentions
to
keep
my
altered
circumstances
to
myself
,
I
made
them
known
to
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
express
how
extremely
delighted
they
both
were
,
by
the
idea
of
my
aunt
's
being
in
difficulties
;
and
how
comfortable
and
friendly
it
made
them
.
   
<EOS>
When
we
were
nearly
come
to
the
last
round
of
the
punch
,
I
addressed
myself
to
Traddles
,
and
reminded
him
that
we
must
not
separate
,
without
wishing
our
friends
health
,
happiness
,
and
success
in
their
new
career
.
 
<EOS>
I
begged
Mr
Micawber
to
fill
us
bumpers
,
and
proposed
the
toast
in
due
form
:
shaking
hands
with
him
across
the
table
,
and
kissing
Mrs
Micawber
,
to
commemorate
that
eventful
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
imitated
me
in
the
first
particular
,
but
did
not
consider
himself
a
sufficiently
old
friend
to
venture
on
the
second
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
rising
with
one
of
his
thumbs
in
each
of
his
waistcoat
pockets
,
"
the
companion
of
my
youth
:
if
I
may
be
allowed
the
expression
---
and
my
esteemed
friend
Traddles
:
if
I
may
be
permitted
to
call
him
so
---
will
allow
me
,
on
the
part
of
Mrs
Micawber
,
myself
,
and
our
offspring
,
to
thank
them
in
the
warmest
and
most
uncompromising
terms
for
their
good
wishes
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
expected
that
on
the
eve
of
a
migration
which
will
consign
us
to
a
perfectly
new
existence
,
"
Mr
Micawber
spoke
as
if
they
were
going
five
hundred
thousand
miles
,
"
I
should
offer
a
few
valedictory
remarks
to
two
such
friends
as
I
see
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
all
that
I
have
to
say
in
this
way
,
I
have
said
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
station
in
society
I
may
attain
,
through
the
medium
of
the
learned
profession
of
which
I
am
about
to
become
an
unworthy
member
,
I
shall
endeavour
not
to
disgrace
,
and
Mrs
Micawber
will
be
safe
to
adorn
.
 
<EOS>
Under
the
temporary
pressure
of
pecuniary
liabilities
,
contracted
with
a
view
to
their
immediate
liquidation
,
but
remaining
unliquidated
through
a
combination
of
circumstances
,
I
have
been
under
the
necessity
of
assuming
a
garb
from
which
my
natural
instincts
recoil
---
<EOS>
I
allude
to
spectacles
---
and
possessing
myself
of
a
cognomen
,
to
which
I
can
establish
no
legitimate
pretensions
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
have
to
say
on
that
score
is
,
that
the
cloud
has
passed
from
the
dreary
scene
,
and
the
God
of
Day
is
once
more
high
upon
the
mountain
tops
.
 
<EOS>
On
Monday
next
,
on
the
arrival
of
the
four
o'clock
afternoon
coach
at
Canterbury
,
my
foot
will
be
on
my
native
heath
---
my
name
,
Micawber
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
resumed
his
seat
on
the
close
of
these
remarks
,
and
drank
two
glasses
of
punch
in
grave
succession
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
said
with
much
solemnity
:
   
<EOS>
"
One
thing
more
I
have
to
do
,
before
this
separation
is
complete
,
and
that
is
to
perform
an
act
of
justice
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
Mr
Thomas
Traddles
has
,
on
two
several
occasions
,
"
put
his
name
"
,
if
I
may
use
a
common
expression
,
to
bills
of
exchange
for
my
accommodation
.
<EOS>
On
the
first
occasion
Mr
Thomas
Traddles
was
left
---
let
me
say
,
in
short
,
in
the
lurch
.
 
<EOS>
The
fulfilment
of
the
second
has
not
yet
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
The
amount
of
the
first
obligation
,
"
here
Mr
Micawber
carefully
referred
to
papers
,
"
was
,
I
believe
,
twenty
-
three
,
four
,
nine
and
a
half
,
of
the
second
,
according
to
my
entry
of
that
transaction
,
eighteen
,
six
,
two
.
 
<EOS>
These
sums
,
united
,
make
a
total
,
if
my
calculation
is
correct
,
amounting
to
forty
-
one
,
ten
,
eleven
and
a
half
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
Copperfield
will
perhaps
do
me
the
favour
to
check
that
total
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
did
so
and
found
it
correct
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
leave
this
metropolis
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
and
my
friend
Mr
Thomas
Traddles
,
without
acquitting
myself
of
the
pecuniary
part
of
this
obligation
,
would
weigh
upon
my
mind
to
an
insupportable
extent
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
,
therefore
,
prepared
for
my
friend
Mr
Thomas
Traddles
,
and
I
now
hold
in
my
hand
,
a
document
,
which
accomplishes
the
desired
object
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
to
hand
to
my
friend
<EOS>
Mr
Thomas
Traddles
<EOS>
my
IOU
 
for
forty
-
one
,
ten
,
eleven
and
a
half
,
<EOS>
and
I
am
happy
to
recover
my
moral
dignity
,
and
to
know
that
I
can
once
more
walk
erect
before
my
fellow
man
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
introduction
(
which
greatly
affected
him
)
,
Mr
Micawber
placed
his
IOU
 
in
the
hands
of
Traddles
,
and
said
he
wished
him
well
in
every
relation
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
persuaded
,
not
only
that
this
was
quite
the
same
to
Mr
Micawber
as
paying
the
money
,
but
that
Traddles
himself
hardly
knew
the
difference
until
he
had
had
time
to
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
walked
so
erect
before
his
fellow
man
,
on
the
strength
of
this
virtuous
action
,
that
his
chest
looked
half
as
broad
again
when
he
lighted
us
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
We
parted
with
great
heartiness
on
both
sides
;
and
when
I
had
seen
Traddles
to
his
own
door
,
and
was
going
home
alone
,
I
thought
,
among
the
other
odd
and
contradictory
things
I
mused
upon
,
that
,
slippery
as
Mr
Micawber
was
,
I
was
probably
indebted
to
some
compassionate
recollection
he
retained
of
me
as
his
boy
-
lodger
,
for
never
having
been
asked
by
him
for
money
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
should
not
have
had
the
moral
courage
to
refuse
it
;
and
I
have
no
doubt
he
knew
that
(
to
his
credit
be
it
written
)
,
quite
as
well
as
I
did
.

Chapter

<EOS>
A
little
cold
water
 
<EOS>
My
new
life
had
lasted
for
more
than
a
week
,
and
I
was
stronger
than
ever
in
those
tremendous
practical
resolutions
that
I
felt
the
crisis
required
.
 
<EOS>
I
continued
to
walk
extremely
fast
,
and
to
have
a
general
idea
that
I
was
getting
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
it
a
rule
to
take
as
much
out
of
myself
as
I
possibly
could
,
in
my
way
of
doing
everything
to
which
I
applied
my
energies
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
a
perfect
victim
of
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
even
entertained
some
idea
of
putting
myself
on
a
vegetable
diet
,
vaguely
conceiving
that
,
in
becoming
a
graminivorous
animal
,
I
should
sacrifice
to
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
As
yet
,
little
Dora
was
quite
unconscious
of
my
desperate
firmness
,
otherwise
than
as
my
letters
darkly
shadowed
it
forth
.
 
<EOS>
But
another
Saturday
came
,
and
on
that
Saturday
evening
she
was
to
be
at
Miss
Mills
's
;
and
when
Mr
Mills
had
gone
to
his
whist
-
club
(
telegraphed
to
me
in
the
street
,
by
a
bird
-
cage
in
the
drawing
-
room
middle
window
)
,
I
was
to
go
there
to
tea
.
   
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
we
were
quite
settled
down
in
Buckingham
Street
,
where
Mr
Dick
continued
his
copying
in
a
state
of
absolute
felicity
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
had
obtained
a
signal
victory
over
Mrs
Crupp
,
by
paying
her
off
,
throwing
the
first
pitcher
she
planted
on
the
stairs
out
of
window
,
and
protecting
in
person
,
up
and
down
the
staircase
,
a
supernumerary
whom
she
engaged
from
the
outer
world
.
<EOS>
These
vigorous
measures
struck
such
terror
to
the
breast
of
Mrs
Crupp
,
that
she
subsided
into
her
own
kitchen
,
under
the
impression
that
my
aunt
was
mad
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
being
supremely
indifferent
to
Mrs
Crupp
's
opinion
and
everybody
else
's
,
and
rather
favouring
than
discouraging
the
idea
,
Mrs
Crupp
,
of
late
the
bold
,
became
within
a
few
days
so
faint
-
hearted
,
that
rather
than
encounter
my
aunt
upon
the
staircase
,
she
would
endeavour
to
hide
her
portly
form
behind
doors
---
leaving
visible
,
however
,
a
wide
margin
of
flannel
petticoat
---
or
would
shrink
into
dark
corners
.
 
<EOS>
This
gave
my
aunt
such
unspeakable
satisfaction
,
that
I
believe
she
took
a
delight
in
prowling
up
and
down
,
with
her
bonnet
insanely
perched
on
the
top
of
her
head
,
at
times
when
Mrs
Crupp
was
likely
to
be
in
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
being
uncommonly
neat
and
ingenious
,
made
so
many
little
improvements
in
our
domestic
arrangements
,
that
I
seemed
to
be
richer
instead
of
poorer
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
rest
,
she
converted
the
pantry
into
a
dressing
-
room
for
me
;
and
purchased
and
embellished
a
bedstead
for
my
occupation
,
which
looked
as
like
a
bookcase
in
the
daytime
as
a
bedstead
could
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
the
object
of
her
constant
solicitude
;
and
my
poor
mother
herself
could
not
have
loved
me
better
,
or
studied
more
how
to
make
me
happy
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
had
considered
herself
highly
privileged
in
being
allowed
to
participate
in
these
labours
;
and
,
although
she
still
retained
something
of
her
old
sentiment
of
awe
in
reference
to
my
aunt
,
had
received
so
many
marks
of
encouragement
and
confidence
,
that
they
were
the
best
friends
possible
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
time
had
now
come
<EOS>
(
I
am
speaking
of
the
Saturday
when
I
was
to
take
tea
at
Miss
Mills
's
)
when
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
return
home
,
and
enter
on
the
discharge
of
the
duties
she
had
undertaken
in
behalf
of
Ham
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
good
-
bye
,
Barkis
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
and
take
care
of
yourself
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
never
thought
I
could
be
sorry
to
lose
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
took
Peggotty
to
the
coach
office
and
saw
her
off
.
 
<EOS>
She
cried
at
parting
,
and
confided
her
brother
to
my
friendship
as
Ham
had
done
.
<EOS>
We
had
heard
nothing
of
him
since
he
went
away
,
that
sunny
afternoon
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
my
own
dear
Davy
,
"
said
Peggotty
,
"
if
,
while
you
're
a
prentice
,
you
should
want
any
money
to
spend
;
or
if
,
when
you
're
out
of
your
time
,
my
dear
,
you
should
want
any
to
set
you
up
(
and
you
must
do
one
or
other
,
or
both
,
my
darling
)
;
who
has
such
a
good
right
to
ask
leave
to
lend
it
you
,
as
my
sweet
girl
's
own
old
stupid
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
not
so
savagely
independent
as
to
say
anything
in
reply
,
but
that
if
ever
I
borrowed
money
of
anyone
,
I
would
borrow
it
of
her
.
<EOS>
Next
to
accepting
a
large
sum
on
the
spot
,
I
believe
this
gave
Peggotty
more
comfort
than
anything
I
could
have
done
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Peggotty
,
"
tell
the
pretty
little
angel
that
I
should
so
have
liked
to
see
her
,
only
for
a
minute
!
 
<EOS>
And
tell
her
that
before
she
marries
my
boy
,
I
'll
come
and
make
your
house
so
beautiful
for
you
,
if
you
'll
let
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
declared
that
nobody
else
should
touch
it
;
and
this
gave
Peggotty
such
delight
that
she
went
away
in
good
spirits
.
   
<EOS>
I
fatigued
myself
as
much
as
I
possibly
could
in
the
Commons
all
day
,
by
a
variety
of
devices
,
and
at
the
appointed
time
in
the
evening
repaired
to
Mr
Mills
's
street
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mills
,
who
was
a
terrible
fellow
to
fall
asleep
after
dinner
,
had
not
yet
gone
out
,
and
there
was
no
bird
-
cage
in
the
middle
window
.
   
<EOS>
He
kept
me
waiting
so
long
,
that
I
fervently
hoped
the
Club
would
fine
him
for
being
late
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
came
out
;
and
then
I
saw
my
own
Dora
hang
up
the
bird
-
cage
,
and
peep
into
the
balcony
to
look
for
me
,
and
run
in
again
when
she
saw
I
was
there
,
while
Jip
remained
behind
,
to
bark
injuriously
at
an
immense
butcher
's
dog
in
the
street
,
who
could
have
taken
him
like
a
pill
.
   
<EOS>
Dora
came
to
the
drawing
-
room
door
to
meet
me
;
and
Jip
came
scrambling
out
,
tumbling
over
his
own
growls
,
under
the
impression
that
I
was
a
Bandit
;
and
we
all
three
went
in
,
as
happy
and
loving
as
could
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
soon
carried
desolation
into
the
bosom
of
our
joys
---
<EOS>
not
that
I
meant
to
do
it
,
but
that
I
was
so
full
of
the
subject
---
by
asking
Dora
,
without
the
smallest
preparation
,
if
she
could
love
a
beggar
?
   
<EOS>
My
pretty
,
little
,
startled
Dora
!
 
<EOS>
Her
only
association
with
the
word
was
a
yellow
face
and
a
nightcap
,
or
a
pair
of
crutches
,
or
a
wooden
leg
,
or
a
dog
with
a
decanter
-
stand
in
his
mouth
,
or
something
of
that
kind
;
and
she
stared
at
me
with
the
most
delightful
wonder
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
ask
me
anything
so
foolish
?
"
<EOS>
pouted
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
Love
a
beggar
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dora
,
my
own
dearest
!
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
beggar
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
be
such
a
silly
thing
,
"
replied
Dora
,
slapping
my
hand
,
"
as
to
sit
there
,
telling
such
stories
?
 
<EOS>
I
'll
make
Jip
bite
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
childish
way
was
the
most
delicious
way
in
the
world
to
me
,
but
it
was
necessary
to
be
explicit
,
and
I
solemnly
repeated
:
   
<EOS>
"
Dora
,
my
own
life
,
I
am
your
ruined
David
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
declare
I
'll
make
Jip
bite
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
Dora
,
shaking
her
curls
,
"
if
you
are
so
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
But
I
looked
so
serious
,
that
Dora
left
off
shaking
her
curls
,
and
laid
her
trembling
little
hand
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
first
looked
scared
and
anxious
,
then
began
to
cry
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
dreadful
.
 
<EOS>
I
fell
upon
my
knees
before
the
sofa
,
caressing
her
,
and
imploring
her
not
to
rend
my
heart
;
but
,
for
some
time
,
poor
little
Dora
did
nothing
but
exclaim
<EOS>
Oh
dear
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
dear
!
 
<EOS>
And
oh
,
she
was
so
frightened
!
 
<EOS>
And
where
was
Julia
Mills
!
 
<EOS>
And
oh
,
take
her
to
Julia
Mills
,
and
go
away
,
please
!
<EOS>
until
I
was
almost
beside
myself
.
   
<EOS>
At
last
,
after
an
agony
of
supplication
and
protestation
,
I
got
Dora
to
look
at
me
,
with
a
horrified
expression
of
face
,
which
I
gradually
soothed
until
it
was
only
loving
,
and
her
soft
,
pretty
cheek
was
lying
against
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
told
her
,
with
my
arms
clasped
round
her
,
how
I
loved
her
,
so
dearly
,
and
so
dearly
;
how
I
felt
it
right
to
offer
to
release
her
from
her
engagement
,
because
now
I
was
poor
;
how
I
never
could
bear
it
,
or
recover
it
,
<EOS>
if
I
lost
her
;
how
I
had
no
fears
of
poverty
,
if
she
had
none
,
my
arm
being
nerved
and
my
heart
inspired
by
her
;
how
I
was
already
working
with
a
courage
such
as
none
but
lovers
knew
;
how
I
had
begun
to
be
practical
,
and
look
into
the
future
;
how
a
crust
well
earned
was
sweeter
far
than
a
feast
inherited
;
and
much
more
to
the
same
purpose
,
which
I
delivered
in
a
burst
of
passionate
eloquence
quite
surprising
to
myself
,
though
I
had
been
thinking
about
it
,
day
and
night
,
ever
since
my
aunt
had
astonished
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
your
heart
mine
still
,
dear
Dora
?
"
said
I
,
rapturously
,
for
I
knew
by
her
clinging
to
me
that
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
!
"
cried
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
it
's
all
yours
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
do
n't
be
dreadful
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
dreadful
!
 
<EOS>
To
Dora
!
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
about
being
poor
,
and
working
hard
!
"
<EOS>
said
Dora
,
nestling
closer
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
,
do
n't
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
love
,
"
said
I
,
"
the
crust
well
-
earned
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
;
but
I
do
n't
want
to
hear
any
more
about
crusts
!
"
said
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
Jip
must
have
a
mutton
-
chop
every
day
at
twelve
,
or
he
'll
die
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
charmed
with
her
childish
,
winning
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
fondly
explained
to
Dora
that
Jip
should
have
his
mutton
-
chop
with
his
accustomed
regularity
.
 
<EOS>
I
drew
a
picture
of
our
frugal
home
,
made
independent
by
my
labour
---
sketching
in
the
little
house
I
had
seen
at
Highgate
,
and
my
aunt
in
her
room
upstairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
dreadful
now
,
Dora
?
"
said
I
,
tenderly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
,
no
!
"
cried
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
hope
your
aunt
will
keep
in
her
own
room
a
good
deal
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
hope
she
's
not
a
scolding
old
thing
!
"
   
<EOS>
If
it
were
possible
for
me
to
love
Dora
more
than
ever
,
I
am
sure
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
felt
she
was
a
little
impracticable
.
 
<EOS>
It
damped
my
new
-
born
ardour
,
to
find
that
ardour
so
difficult
of
communication
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
another
trial
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
was
quite
herself
again
,
and
was
curling
Jip
's
ears
,
as
he
lay
upon
her
lap
,
I
became
grave
,
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
My
own
!
 
<EOS>
May
I
mention
something
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
please
do
n't
be
practical
!
"
<EOS>
said
Dora
,
coaxingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
it
frightens
me
so
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sweetheart
!
"
<EOS>
I
returned
;
"
there
is
nothing
to
alarm
you
in
all
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
think
of
it
quite
differently
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
make
it
nerve
you
,
and
inspire
you
,
Dora
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
that
's
so
shocking
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
love
,
no
.
 
Perseverance
and
strength
of
character
will
enable
us
to
bear
much
worse
things
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
n't
got
any
strength
at
all
,
"
said
Dora
,
shaking
her
curls
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
I
,
Jip
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
do
kiss
Jip
,
and
be
agreeable
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
resist
kissing
Jip
,
when
she
held
him
up
to
me
for
that
purpose
,
putting
her
own
bright
,
rosy
little
mouth
into
kissing
form
,
as
she
directed
the
operation
,
which
she
insisted
should
be
performed
symmetrically
,
on
the
centre
of
his
nose
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
as
she
bade
me
---
rewarding
myself
afterwards
for
my
obedience
---
<EOS>
and
she
charmed
me
out
of
my
graver
character
for
I
do
n't
know
how
long
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
Dora
,
my
beloved
!
"
<EOS>
said
I
,
at
last
resuming
it
;
"
I
was
going
to
mention
something
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
judge
of
the
Prerogative
Court
might
have
fallen
in
love
with
her
,
to
see
her
fold
her
little
hands
and
hold
them
up
,
begging
and
praying
me
not
to
be
dreadful
any
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
am
not
going
to
be
,
my
darling
!
<EOS>
"
I
assured
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
Dora
,
my
love
,
if
you
will
sometimes
think
,
---
not
despondingly
,
you
know
;
far
from
that
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
but
if
you
will
sometimes
think
---
just
to
encourage
yourself
---
that
you
are
engaged
to
a
poor
man
---
"
   
"
Do
n't
,
do
n't
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
n't
!
"
cried
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
so
very
dreadful
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
soul
,
not
at
all
!
"
said
I
,
cheerfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
sometimes
think
of
that
,
and
look
about
now
and
then
at
your
papa
's
housekeeping
,
and
endeavour
to
acquire
a
little
habit
---
of
accounts
,
for
instance
---
"
   
Poor
little
Dora
received
this
suggestion
with
something
that
was
half
a
sob
and
half
a
scream
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
It
would
be
so
useful
to
us
afterwards
,
"
I
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
if
you
would
promise
me
to
read
a
little
---
a
little
Cookery
Book
that
I
would
send
you
,
it
would
be
so
excellent
for
both
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
For
our
path
in
life
,
my
Dora
,
"
said
I
,
warming
with
the
subject
,
"
is
stony
and
rugged
now
,
and
it
rests
with
us
to
smooth
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
fight
our
way
onward
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
be
brave
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
obstacles
to
be
met
,
and
we
must
meet
,
and
crush
them
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
going
on
at
a
great
rate
,
with
a
clenched
hand
,
and
a
most
enthusiastic
countenance
;
but
it
was
quite
unnecessary
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
I
had
said
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
done
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
she
was
so
frightened
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
where
was
Julia
Mills
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
take
her
to
Julia
Mills
,
and
go
away
,
please
!
 
<EOS>
So
that
,
in
short
,
I
was
quite
distracted
,
and
raved
about
the
drawing
-
room
.
   
<EOS>
I
thought
I
had
killed
her
,
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
sprinkled
water
on
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
down
on
my
knees
.
 
<EOS>
I
plucked
at
my
hair
.
 
<EOS>
I
denounced
myself
as
a
remorseless
brute
and
a
ruthless
beast
.
 
<EOS>
I
implored
her
forgiveness
.
 
<EOS>
I
besought
her
to
look
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
ravaged
Miss
Mills
's
work
-
box
for
a
smelling
-
bottle
,
and
in
my
agony
of
mind
applied
an
ivory
needle
-
case
instead
,
and
dropped
all
the
needles
over
Dora
.
<EOS>
I
shook
my
fists
at
Jip
,
who
was
as
frantic
as
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
every
wild
extravagance
that
could
be
done
,
and
was
a
long
way
beyond
the
end
of
my
wits
when
Miss
Mills
came
into
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
has
done
this
?
"
exclaimed
Miss
Mills
,
succouring
her
friend
.
   
<EOS>
I
replied
,
"
I
,
Miss
Mills
!
<EOS>
I
have
done
it
!
 
<EOS>
Behold
the
destroyer
!
"
<EOS>
---
or
words
to
that
effect
---
and
hid
my
face
from
the
light
,
in
the
sofa
cushion
.
   
<EOS>
At
first
Miss
Mills
thought
it
was
a
quarrel
,
and
that
we
were
verging
on
the
Desert
of
Sahara
;
but
she
soon
found
out
how
matters
stood
,
for
my
dear
affectionate
little
Dora
,
embracing
her
,
began
exclaiming
that
I
was
"
a
poor
labourer
"
;
and
then
cried
for
me
,
and
embraced
me
,
and
asked
me
would
I
let
her
give
me
all
her
money
to
keep
,
and
then
fell
on
Miss
Mills
's
neck
,
sobbing
as
if
her
tender
heart
were
broken
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
must
have
been
born
to
be
a
blessing
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
She
ascertained
from
me
in
a
few
words
what
it
was
all
about
,
comforted
Dora
,
and
gradually
convinced
her
that
I
was
not
a
labourer
---
from
my
manner
of
stating
the
case
I
believe
Dora
concluded
that
I
was
a
navigator
,
and
went
balancing
myself
up
and
down
a
plank
all
day
with
a
wheelbarrow
---
and
so
brought
us
together
in
peace
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
were
quite
composed
,
and
Dora
had
gone
up
-
stairs
to
put
some
rose
-
water
to
her
eyes
,
Miss
Mills
rang
for
tea
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
ensuing
interval
,
I
told
Miss
Mills
that
she
was
evermore
my
friend
,
and
that
my
heart
must
cease
to
vibrate
ere
<EOS>
I
could
forget
her
sympathy
.
   
<EOS>
I
then
expounded
to
Miss
Mills
what
I
had
endeavoured
,
so
very
unsuccessfully
,
to
expound
to
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
replied
,
on
general
principles
,
that
the
Cottage
of
content
was
better
than
the
Palace
of
cold
splendour
,
and
that
where
love
was
,
all
was
.
   
<EOS>
I
said
to
Miss
Mills
that
this
was
very
true
,
and
who
should
know
it
better
than
I
,
who
loved
Dora
with
a
love
that
never
mortal
had
experienced
yet
?
 
<EOS>
But
on
Miss
Mills
observing
,
with
despondency
,
that
it
were
well
indeed
for
some
hearts
if
this
were
so
,
I
explained
that
I
begged
leave
to
restrict
the
observation
to
mortals
of
the
masculine
gender
.
   
<EOS>
I
then
put
it
to
Miss
Mills
,
to
say
whether
she
considered
that
there
was
or
was
not
any
practical
merit
in
the
suggestion
I
had
been
anxious
to
make
,
concerning
the
accounts
,
the
housekeeping
,
and
the
Cookery
Book
?
   
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
,
after
some
consideration
,
thus
replied
:
   
"
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
I
will
be
plain
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Mental
suffering
and
trial
supply
,
in
some
natures
,
the
place
of
years
,
and
I
will
be
as
plain
with
you
as
if
I
were
a
Lady
Abbess
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
The
suggestion
is
not
appropriate
to
our
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
Our
dearest
<EOS>
Dora
is
a
favourite
child
of
nature
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
a
thing
of
light
,
and
airiness
,
and
joy
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
free
to
confess
that
if
it
could
be
done
,
it
might
be
well
,
<EOS>
but
---
"
And
Miss
Mills
shook
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
encouraged
by
this
closing
admission
on
the
part
of
Miss
Mills
to
ask
her
,
whether
,
for
Dora
's
sake
,
if
she
had
any
opportunity
of
luring
her
attention
to
such
preparations
for
an
earnest
life
,
she
would
avail
herself
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
replied
in
the
affirmative
so
readily
,
that
I
further
asked
her
if
she
would
take
charge
of
the
Cookery
Book
;
and
,
if
she
ever
could
insinuate
it
upon
Dora
's
acceptance
,
without
frightening
her
,
undertake
to
do
me
that
crowning
service
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
accepted
this
trust
,
too
;
but
was
not
sanguine
.
   
<EOS>
And
Dora
returned
,
looking
such
a
lovely
little
creature
,
that
I
really
doubted
whether
she
ought
to
be
troubled
with
anything
so
ordinary
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
loved
me
so
much
,
and
was
so
captivating
(
particularly
when
she
made
Jip
stand
on
his
hind
legs
for
toast
,
and
when
she
pretended
to
hold
that
nose
of
his
against
the
hot
teapot
for
punishment
because
he
would
n't
)
,
that
I
felt
like
a
sort
of
Monster
who
had
got
into
a
Fairy
's
bower
,
when
I
thought
of
having
frightened
her
,
and
made
her
cry
.
   
<EOS>
After
tea
we
had
the
guitar
;
and
Dora
sang
those
same
dear
old
French
songs
about
the
impossibility
of
ever
on
any
account
leaving
off
dancing
,
La
ra
la
,
<EOS>
La
ra
la
,
until
I
felt
a
much
greater
Monster
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
only
one
check
to
our
pleasure
,
and
that
happened
a
little
while
before
I
took
my
leave
,
when
,
Miss
Mills
chancing
to
make
some
allusion
to
tomorrow
morning
,
I
unluckily
let
out
that
,
being
obliged
to
exert
myself
now
<EOS>
,
I
got
up
at
five
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
Dora
had
any
idea
that
I
was
a
Private
Watchman
,
I
am
unable
to
say
;
but
it
made
a
great
impression
on
her
,
and
she
neither
played
nor
sang
any
more
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
still
on
her
mind
when
I
bade
her
adieu
;
and
she
said
to
me
,
in
her
pretty
coaxing
way
---
as
if
I
were
a
doll
,
I
used
to
think
:
   
"
Now
do
n't
get
up
at
five
o'clock
,
<EOS>
you
naughty
boy
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
so
nonsensical
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
"
said
I
,
"
I
have
work
to
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
do
n't
do
it
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
say
to
that
sweet
little
surprised
face
,
otherwise
than
lightly
and
playfully
,
that
we
must
work
to
live
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
How
ridiculous
!
"
cried
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
shall
we
live
without
,
Dora
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
How
?
 
<EOS>
Any
how
!
"
said
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
think
she
had
quite
settled
the
question
,
and
gave
me
such
a
triumphant
little
kiss
,
direct
from
her
innocent
heart
,
that
I
would
hardly
have
put
her
out
of
conceit
with
her
answer
,
for
a
fortune
.
   
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
I
loved
her
,
and
I
went
on
loving
her
,
most
absorbingly
,
entirely
,
and
completely
.
 
<EOS>
But
going
on
,
too
,
working
pretty
hard
,
and
busily
keeping
red
-
hot
all
the
irons
I
now
had
in
the
fire
,
I
would
sit
sometimes
of
a
night
,
opposite
my
aunt
,
thinking
how
I
had
frightened
Dora
that
time
,
and
how
I
could
best
make
my
way
with
a
guitar
-
case
through
the
forest
of
difficulty
,
until
I
used
to
fancy
that
my
head
was
turning
quite
grey
.

Chapter
38
.
<EOS>
A
dissolution
of
partnership
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
allow
my
resolution
,
with
respect
to
the
Parliamentary
Debates
,
to
cool
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
the
irons
I
began
to
heat
immediately
,
and
one
of
the
irons
I
kept
hot
,
and
hammered
at
,
with
a
perseverance
I
may
honestly
admire
.
 
<EOS>
I
bought
an
approved
scheme
of
the
noble
art
and
mystery
of
stenography
(
which
cost
me
ten
and
sixpence
)
;
and
plunged
into
a
sea
of
perplexity
that
brought
me
,
in
a
few
weeks
,
to
the
confines
of
distraction
.
 
<EOS>
The
changes
that
were
rung
upon
dots
,
which
in
such
a
position
meant
such
a
thing
,
and
in
such
another
position
something
else
,
entirely
different
;
the
wonderful
vagaries
that
were
played
by
circles
;
the
unaccountable
consequences
that
resulted
from
marks
like
flies
'
legs
;
the
tremendous
effects
of
a
curve
in
a
wrong
place
;
not
only
troubled
my
waking
hours
,
but
reappeared
before
me
in
my
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
had
groped
my
way
,
blindly
,
through
these
difficulties
,
and
had
mastered
the
alphabet
,
which
was
an
Egyptian
Temple
in
itself
,
there
then
appeared
a
procession
of
new
horrors
,
called
arbitrary
characters
;
the
most
despotic
characters
I
have
ever
known
;
who
insisted
,
for
instance
,
that
a
thing
like
the
beginning
of
a
cobweb
,
meant
expectation
,
and
that
a
pen
-
and
-
ink
sky
-
rocket
,
stood
for
disadvantageous
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
had
fixed
these
wretches
in
my
mind
,
I
found
that
they
had
driven
everything
else
out
of
it
;
then
,
beginning
again
,
I
forgot
them
;
while
I
was
picking
them
up
,
I
dropped
the
other
fragments
of
the
system
;
in
short
,
it
was
almost
heart
-
breaking
.
   
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
quite
heart
-
breaking
,
but
for
Dora
,
who
was
the
stay
and
anchor
of
my
tempest
-
driven
bark
.
 
<EOS>
Every
scratch
in
the
scheme
was
a
gnarled
oak
in
the
forest
of
difficulty
,
and
I
went
on
cutting
them
down
,
one
after
another
,
with
such
vigour
,
that
in
three
or
four
months
I
was
in
a
condition
to
make
an
experiment
on
one
of
our
crack
speakers
in
the
Commons
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
ever
forget
how
the
crack
speaker
walked
off
from
me
before
I
began
,
and
left
my
imbecile
pencil
staggering
about
the
paper
as
if
it
were
in
a
fit
!
   
<EOS>
This
would
not
do
,
it
was
quite
clear
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
flying
too
high
,
and
should
never
get
on
,
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
resorted
to
Traddles
for
advice
;
who
suggested
that
he
should
dictate
speeches
to
me
,
at
a
pace
,
and
with
occasional
stoppages
,
adapted
to
my
weakness
.
 
<EOS>
Very
grateful
for
this
friendly
aid
,
I
accepted
the
proposal
;
and
night
after
night
,
almost
every
night
,
for
a
long
time
,
we
had
a
sort
of
Private
Parliament
in
Buckingham
Street
,
after
I
came
home
from
the
Doctor
's
.
   
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
such
a
Parliament
anywhere
else
!
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
and
Mr
Dick
represented
the
Government
or
the
Opposition
(
as
the
case
might
be
)
,
and
Traddles
,
with
the
assistance
of
Enfield
's
Speakers
,
or
a
volume
of
parliamentary
orations
,
thundered
astonishing
invectives
against
them
.
 
<EOS>
Standing
by
the
table
,
with
his
finger
in
the
page
to
keep
the
place
,
and
his
right
arm
flourishing
above
his
head
,
Traddles
,
as
Mr
Pitt
,
Mr
Fox
,
Mr
Sheridan
,
Mr
Burke
,
Lord
Castlereagh
,
Viscount
Sidmouth
,
or
Mr
Canning
,
would
work
himself
into
the
most
violent
heats
,
and
deliver
the
most
withering
denunciations
of
the
profligacy
and
corruption
of
my
aunt
and
Mr
Dick
;
while
I
used
to
sit
,
at
a
little
distance
,
with
my
notebook
on
my
knee
,
fagging
after
him
with
all
my
might
and
main
.
 
<EOS>
The
inconsistency
and
recklessness
of
Traddles
were
not
to
be
exceeded
by
any
real
politician
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
for
any
description
of
policy
,
in
the
compass
of
a
week
;
and
nailed
all
sorts
of
colours
to
every
denomination
of
mast
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
looking
very
like
an
immovable
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
would
occasionally
throw
in
an
interruption
or
two
,
as
"
Hear
!
"
or
"
No
!
"
or
"
Oh
!
"
when
the
text
seemed
to
require
it
:
which
was
always
a
signal
to
Mr
Dick
(
a
perfect
country
gentleman
)
to
follow
lustily
with
the
same
cry
.
<EOS>
But
Mr
Dick
got
taxed
with
such
things
in
the
course
of
his
Parliamentary
career
,
and
was
made
responsible
for
such
awful
consequences
,
that
he
became
uncomfortable
in
his
mind
sometimes
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
actually
began
to
be
afraid
he
really
had
been
doing
something
,
tending
to
the
annihilation
of
the
British
constitution
,
and
the
ruin
of
the
country
.
   
<EOS>
Often
and
often
we
pursued
these
debates
until
the
clock
pointed
to
midnight
,
and
the
candles
were
burning
down
.
 
<EOS>
The
result
of
so
much
good
practice
was
,
that
by
and
by
I
began
to
keep
pace
with
Traddles
pretty
well
,
and
should
have
been
quite
triumphant
if
I
had
had
the
least
idea
what
my
notes
were
about
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
to
reading
them
after
I
had
got
them
,
I
might
as
well
have
copied
the
Chinese
inscriptions
of
an
immense
collection
of
tea
-
chests
,
or
the
golden
characters
on
all
the
great
red
and
green
bottles
in
the
chemists
'
shops
!
   
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
for
it
,
but
to
turn
back
and
begin
all
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
hard
,
but
I
turned
back
,
though
with
a
heavy
heart
,
and
began
laboriously
and
methodically
to
plod
over
the
same
tedious
ground
at
a
snail
's
pace
;
stopping
to
examine
minutely
every
speck
in
the
way
,
on
all
sides
,
and
making
the
most
desperate
efforts
to
know
these
elusive
characters
by
sight
wherever
I
met
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
always
punctual
at
the
office
;
at
the
Doctor
's
too
:
and
I
really
did
work
,
as
the
common
expression
is
,
like
a
cart
-
horse
.
<EOS>
One
day
,
when
I
went
to
the
Commons
as
usual
,
I
found
Mr
Spenlow
in
the
doorway
looking
extremely
grave
,
and
talking
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
was
in
the
habit
of
complaining
of
pains
in
his
head
---
he
had
naturally
a
short
throat
,
and
I
do
seriously
believe
he
over
-
starched
himself
---
<EOS>
I
was
at
first
alarmed
by
the
idea
that
he
was
not
quite
right
in
that
direction
;
but
he
soon
relieved
my
uneasiness
.
   
<EOS>
Instead
of
returning
my
"
Good
morning
"
with
his
usual
affability
,
he
looked
at
me
in
a
distant
,
ceremonious
manner
,
and
coldly
requested
me
to
accompany
him
to
a
certain
coffee
-
house
,
which
,
in
those
days
,
had
a
door
opening
into
the
Commons
,
just
within
the
little
archway
in
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
I
complied
,
in
a
very
uncomfortable
state
,
and
with
a
warm
shooting
all
over
me
,
as
if
my
apprehensions
were
breaking
out
into
buds
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
allowed
him
to
go
on
a
little
before
,
on
account
of
the
narrowness
of
the
way
,
I
observed
that
he
carried
his
head
with
a
lofty
air
that
was
particularly
unpromising
;
and
my
mind
misgave
me
that
he
had
found
out
about
my
darling
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
If
I
had
not
guessed
this
,
on
the
way
to
the
coffee
-
house
,
I
could
hardly
have
failed
to
know
what
was
the
matter
when
I
followed
him
into
an
upstairs
room
,
and
found
Miss
Murdstone
there
,
supported
by
a
background
of
sideboard
,
on
which
were
several
inverted
tumblers
sustaining
lemons
,
and
two
of
those
extraordinary
boxes
,
all
corners
and
flutings
,
for
sticking
knives
and
forks
in
,
which
,
happily
for
mankind
,
are
now
obsolete
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
gave
me
her
chilly
finger
-
nails
,
and
sat
severely
rigid
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
shut
the
door
,
motioned
me
to
a
chair
,
and
stood
on
the
hearth
-
rug
in
front
of
the
fireplace
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
the
goodness
to
show
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
,
"
what
you
have
in
your
reticule
,
Miss
Murdstone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
believe
it
was
the
old
identical
steel
-
clasped
reticule
of
my
childhood
,
that
shut
up
like
a
bite
.
 
<EOS>
Compressing
her
lips
,
in
sympathy
with
the
snap
,
Miss
Murdstone
opened
it
---
opening
her
mouth
a
little
at
the
same
time
---
and
produced
my
last
letter
to
Dora
,
teeming
with
expressions
of
devoted
affection
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
that
is
your
writing
,
Mr
Copperfield
?
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
very
hot
,
and
the
voice
I
heard
was
very
unlike
mine
,
when
I
said
,
"
It
is
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
am
not
mistaken
,
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
,
as
Miss
Murdstone
brought
a
parcel
of
letters
out
of
her
reticule
,
tied
round
with
the
dearest
bit
of
blue
ribbon
,
"
those
are
also
from
your
pen
,
Mr
Copperfield
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
took
them
from
her
with
a
most
desolate
sensation
;
and
,
glancing
at
such
phrases
at
the
top
,
as
"
My
ever
dearest
and
own
Dora
,
"
"
My
best
beloved
angel
,
"
"
<EOS>
My
blessed
one
for
ever
,
"
and
the
like
,
blushed
deeply
,
and
inclined
my
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
Mr
Spenlow
,
coldly
,
as
I
mechanically
offered
them
back
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
deprive
you
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
,
be
so
good
as
to
proceed
!
"
   
<EOS>
That
gentle
creature
,
after
a
moment
's
thoughtful
survey
of
the
carpet
,
delivered
herself
with
much
dry
unction
as
follows
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
confess
to
having
entertained
my
suspicions
of
Miss
Spenlow
,
in
reference
to
David
Copperfield
,
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
observed
Miss
Spenlow
and
David
Copperfield
,
when
they
first
met
;
and
the
impression
made
upon
me
then
was
not
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
The
depravity
of
the
human
heart
is
such
---
"
   
"
You
will
oblige
me
,
ma'am
,
"
interrupted
Mr
Spenlow
,
"
by
confining
yourself
to
facts
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
cast
down
her
eyes
,
shook
her
head
as
if
protesting
against
this
unseemly
interruption
,
and
with
frowning
dignity
resumed
:
   
"
Since
I
am
to
confine
myself
to
facts
,
I
will
state
them
as
dryly
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
that
will
be
considered
an
acceptable
course
of
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
already
said
,
sir
,
that
I
have
had
my
suspicions
of
Miss
Spenlow
,
in
reference
to
David
Copperfield
,
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
frequently
endeavoured
to
find
decisive
corroboration
of
those
suspicions
,
but
without
effect
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
therefore
forborne
to
mention
them
to
Miss
Spenlow
's
father
"
;
looking
severely
at
him
---
"
<EOS>
knowing
how
little
disposition
there
usually
is
in
such
cases
,
to
acknowledge
the
conscientious
discharge
of
duty
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
seemed
quite
cowed
by
the
gentlemanly
sternness
of
Miss
Murdstone
's
manner
,
and
deprecated
her
severity
with
a
conciliatory
little
wave
of
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
On
my
return
to
Norwood
,
after
the
period
of
absence
occasioned
by
my
brother
's
marriage
,
"
pursued
Miss
Murdstone
in
a
disdainful
voice
,
"
and
on
the
return
of
Miss
Spenlow
from
her
visit
to
her
friend
Miss
Mills
,
I
imagined
that
the
manner
of
Miss
Spenlow
gave
me
greater
occasion
for
suspicion
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
watched
Miss
Spenlow
closely
.
"
   
<EOS>
Dear
,
tender
little
Dora
,
so
unconscious
of
this
Dragon
's
eye
!
   
<EOS>
"
Still
,
"
resumed
Miss
Murdstone
,
"
I
found
no
proof
until
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
It
appeared
to
me
that
Miss
Spenlow
received
too
many
letters
from
her
friend
Miss
Mills
;
but
Miss
Mills
being
her
friend
with
her
father
's
full
concurrence
,
"
another
telling
blow
at
Mr
Spenlow
,
"
it
was
not
for
me
to
interfere
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
may
not
be
permitted
to
allude
to
the
natural
depravity
of
the
human
heart
,
at
least
I
may
---
I
must
---
be
permitted
,
so
far
to
refer
to
misplaced
confidence
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
apologetically
murmured
his
assent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Last
evening
after
tea
,
"
pursued
Miss
Murdstone
,
"
I
observed
the
little
dog
starting
,
rolling
,
and
growling
about
the
drawing
-
room
,
worrying
something
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
to
Miss
Spenlow
,
"
Dora
,
what
is
that
the
dog
has
in
his
mouth
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
paper
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Spenlow
immediately
put
her
hand
to
her
frock
,
gave
a
sudden
cry
,
and
ran
to
the
dog
.
<EOS>
I
interposed
,
and
said
,
"
Dora
,
my
love
,
you
must
permit
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
Oh
Jip
,
miserable
Spaniel
,
this
wretchedness
,
then
,
was
your
work
!
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Spenlow
endeavoured
,
"
said
Miss
Murdstone
,
"
to
bribe
me
with
kisses
,
work
-
boxes
,
and
small
articles
of
jewellery
---
that
,
of
course
,
I
pass
over
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
dog
retreated
under
the
sofa
on
my
approaching
him
,
and
was
with
great
difficulty
dislodged
by
the
fire
-
irons
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
dislodged
,
he
still
kept
the
letter
in
his
mouth
;
and
on
my
endeavouring
to
take
it
from
him
,
at
the
imminent
risk
of
being
bitten
<EOS>
,
he
kept
it
between
his
teeth
so
pertinaciously
as
to
suffer
himself
to
be
held
suspended
in
the
air
by
means
of
the
document
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
I
obtained
possession
of
it
.
<EOS>
After
perusing
it
,
I
taxed
Miss
Spenlow
with
having
many
such
letters
in
her
possession
;
and
ultimately
obtained
from
her
the
packet
which
is
now
in
David
Copperfield
's
hand
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
she
ceased
;
and
snapping
her
reticule
again
,
and
shutting
her
mouth
,
looked
as
if
she
might
be
broken
,
but
could
never
be
bent
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
heard
Miss
Murdstone
,
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
,
turning
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
beg
to
ask
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
if
you
have
anything
to
say
in
reply
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
picture
I
had
before
me
,
of
the
beautiful
little
treasure
of
my
heart
,
sobbing
and
crying
all
night
---
of
her
being
alone
,
frightened
,
and
wretched
,
then
---
of
her
having
so
piteously
begged
and
prayed
that
stony
-
hearted
woman
to
forgive
her
---
of
her
having
vainly
<EOS>
offered
her
those
kisses
,
work
-
boxes
,
and
trinkets
---
of
her
being
in
such
grievous
distress
,
and
<EOS>
all
for
me
---
very
much
impaired
the
little
dignity
<EOS>
I
had
been
able
to
muster
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
I
was
in
a
tremulous
state
for
a
minute
or
so
,
though
I
did
my
best
to
disguise
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
I
can
say
,
sir
,
"
I
returned
,
"
except
that
all
the
blame
is
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Dora

"
   
"
Miss
Spenlow
,
if
you
please

"
said
her
father
,
majestically
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
was
induced
and
persuaded
by
me
,
"
I
went
on
,
swallowing
that
colder
designation
,
"
to
consent
to
this
concealment
,
and
I
bitterly
regret
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
much
to
blame
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
,
walking
to
and
fro
upon
the
hearth
-
rug
,
and
emphasizing
what
he
said
with
his
whole
body
instead
of
his
head
,
on
account
of
the
stiffness
of
his
cravat
and
spine
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
done
a
stealthy
and
unbecoming
action

Mr
Copperfield

When
I
take
a
gentleman
to
my
house

no

whether
he
is
nineteen

twenty
-
nine
,
or
ninety

I
take
him
there
in

spirit

confidence

If
he
abuses
my
confidence

he
commits
a
dishonourable
action

<EOS>
"
I
feel
it
,
sir

I
assure
you

I
returned

But
I
never

so

before

Sincerely

honestly

indeed

Mr
Spenlow

I
never

so

I
love
Miss
Spenlow

that
extent

"
   
"
Pooh

nonsense

said
Mr
Spenlow
,
reddening
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
tell
me
to
my
face
that
you
love
my
daughter
,
Mr
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Could
I
defend
my
conduct
if
I
did
not
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
returned
,
with
all
humility
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
you
defend
your
conduct
if
you
do
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
,
stopping
short
upon
the
hearth
-
rug
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
considered
your
years
,
and
my
daughter
's
years
,
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
considered
what
it
is
to
undermine
the
confidence
that
should
subsist
between
my
daughter
and
myself
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
considered
my
daughter
's
station
in
life
,
the
projects
I
may
contemplate
for
her
advancement
,
the
testamentary
intentions
I
may
have
with
reference
to
her
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
considered
anything
,
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
little
,
sir
,
I
am
afraid
;
"
I
answered
,
speaking
to
him
as
respectfully
and
sorrowfully
as
I
felt
;
"
but
pray
believe
me
,
I
have
considered
my
own
worldly
position
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
explained
it
to
you
,
we
were
already
engaged
---
"
   
"
I
BEG
,
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
,
more
like
Punch
than
I
had
ever
seen
him
,
as
he
energetically
struck
one
hand
upon
the
other
<EOS>
---
I
could
not
help
noticing
that
even
in
my
despair
;
"
that
YOU
Will
NOT
talk
to
me
of
engagements
,
Mr
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
otherwise
immovable
Miss
Murdstone
laughed
contemptuously
in
one
short
syllable
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
explained
my
altered
position
to
you
,
sir
,
"
I
began
again
,
substituting
a
new
form
of
expression
for
what
was
so
unpalatable
to
him
,
"
this
concealment
,
into
which
I
am
so
unhappy
as
to
have
led
Miss
Spenlow
,
had
begun
.
 
<EOS>
Since
I
have
been
in
that
altered
position
,
I
have
strained
every
nerve
,
I
have
exerted
every
energy
,
to
improve
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
shall
improve
it
in
time
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
grant
me
time
---
any
length
of
time
?
 
<EOS>
We
are
both
so
young
,
sir
<EOS>
,
---
"
   
"
You
are
right
,
"
interrupted
Mr
Spenlow
,
nodding
his
head
a
great
many
times
,
and
frowning
very
much
,
"
you
are
both
very
young
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
Let
there
be
an
end
of
the
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
Take
away
those
letters
,
and
throw
them
in
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
Miss
Spenlow
's
letters
to
throw
in
the
fire
;
and
although
our
future
intercourse
must
,
you
are
aware
,
be
restricted
to
the
Commons
here
<EOS>
,
we
will
agree
to
make
no
further
mention
of
the
past
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
you
do
n't
want
sense
;
and
this
is
the
sensible
course
.
"
   
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
think
of
agreeing
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
very
sorry
,
but
there
was
a
higher
consideration
than
sense
.
 
<EOS>
Love
was
above
all
earthly
considerations
,
and
I
loved
Dora
to
idolatry
,
and
Dora
loved
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
exactly
say
so
;
I
softened
it
down
as
much
as
I
could
;
but
I
implied
it
,
and
I
was
resolute
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
made
myself
very
ridiculous
,
but
<EOS>
I
know
I
was
resolute
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
,
"
I
must
try
my
influence
with
my
daughter
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
,
by
an
expressive
sound
,
a
long
drawn
respiration
,
which
was
neither
a
sigh
nor
a
moan
,
but
was
like
both
,
gave
it
as
her
opinion
that
he
should
have
done
this
at
first
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
try
,
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
,
confirmed
by
this
support
,
"
my
influence
with
my
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
decline
to
take
those
letters
,
Mr
Copperfield
?
<EOS>
"
For
I
had
laid
them
on
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
hoped
he
would
not
think
it
wrong
,
but
I
could
n't
possibly
take
them
from
Miss
Murdstone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nor
from
me
?
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
.
   
<EOS>
No
,
I
replied
with
the
profoundest
respect
;
nor
from
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
!
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
.
   
<EOS>
A
silence
succeeding
<EOS>
,
I
was
undecided
whether
to
go
or
stay
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
I
was
moving
quietly
towards
the
door
,
with
the
intention
of
saying
that
perhaps
I
should
consult
his
feelings
best
by
withdrawing
:
when
he
said
,
with
his
hands
in
his
coat
pockets
,
into
which
it
was
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
get
them
;
and
with
what
I
should
call
,
upon
the
whole
,
a
decidedly
pious
air
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
probably
aware
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
that
I
am
not
altogether
destitute
of
worldly
possessions
,
and
that
my
daughter
is
my
nearest
and
dearest
relative
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
hurriedly
made
him
a
reply
to
the
effect
,
that
I
hoped
the
error
into
which
I
had
been
betrayed
by
the
desperate
nature
of
my
love
,
did
not
induce
him
to
think
me
mercenary
too
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
allude
to
the
matter
in
that
light
,
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
better
for
yourself
,
and
all
of
us
,
if
you
WERE
mercenary
,
Mr
Copperfield
---
I
mean
,
if
you
were
more
discreet
and
less
influenced
by
all
this
youthful
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
merely
say
,
with
quite
another
view
,
you
are
probably
aware
I
have
some
property
to
bequeath
to
my
child
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
certainly
supposed
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
you
can
hardly
think
,
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
,
"
having
experience
of
what
we
see
,
in
the
Commons
here
,
every
day
,
of
the
various
unaccountable
and
negligent
proceedings
of
men
,
in
respect
of
their
testamentary
arrangements
---
of
all
subjects
,
the
one
on
which
perhaps
the
strangest
revelations
of
human
inconsistency
are
to
be
met
with
---
but
that
mine
are
made
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
inclined
my
head
in
acquiescence
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
allow
,
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
,
with
an
evident
increase
of
pious
sentiment
,
and
slowly
shaking
his
head
as
he
poised
himself
upon
his
toes
and
heels
alternately
,
"
my
suitable
provision
for
my
child
to
be
influenced
by
a
piece
of
youthful
folly
like
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
mere
folly
.
 
<EOS>
Mere
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
little
while
,
it
will
weigh
lighter
than
any
feather
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
might
---
<EOS>
I
might
---
if
this
silly
business
were
not
completely
relinquished
altogether
,
be
induced
in
some
anxious
moment
to
guard
her
from
,
and
surround
her
with
protections
against
,
the
consequences
of
any
foolish
step
in
the
way
of
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
I
hope
that
you
will
not
render
it
necessary
for
me
to
open
,
even
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
that
closed
page
in
the
book
of
life
,
and
unsettle
,
even
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
grave
affairs
long
since
composed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
serenity
,
a
tranquillity
,
a
calm
sunset
air
about
him
,
which
quite
affected
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
peaceful
and
resigned
---
clearly
had
his
affairs
in
such
perfect
train
,
and
so
systematically
wound
up
---
that
he
was
a
man
to
feel
touched
in
the
contemplation
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
really
think
I
saw
tears
rise
to
his
eyes
,
from
the
depth
of
his
own
feeling
of
all
this
.
   
<EOS>
But
what
could
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
deny
Dora
and
my
own
heart
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
told
me
I
had
better
take
a
week
to
consider
of
what
he
had
said
,
how
could
I
say
I
would
n't
take
a
week
,
yet
how
could
I
fail
to
know
that
no
amount
of
weeks
could
influence
such
love
as
mine
?
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
meantime
,
confer
with
Miss
Trotwood
,
or
with
any
person
with
any
knowledge
of
life
,
"
said
Mr
Spenlow
,
adjusting
his
cravat
with
both
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
a
week
,
Mr
Copperfield
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
submitted
;
and
,
with
a
countenance
as
expressive
as
I
was
able
to
make
it
of
dejected
and
despairing
constancy
,
came
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Miss
Murdstone
's
heavy
eyebrows
followed
me
to
the
door
---
I
say
her
eyebrows
rather
than
her
eyes
,
because
they
were
much
more
important
in
her
face
---
and
she
looked
so
exactly
as
she
used
to
look
,
at
about
that
hour
of
the
morning
,
in
our
parlour
at
Blunderstone
,
that
I
could
have
fancied
I
had
been
breaking
down
in
my
lessons
again
,
and
that
the
dead
weight
on
my
mind
was
that
horrible
old
spelling
-
book
,
with
oval
woodcuts
,
shaped
,
to
my
youthful
fancy
,
like
the
glasses
out
of
spectacles
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
got
to
the
office
,
and
,
shutting
out
old
Tiffey
and
the
rest
of
them
with
my
hands
,
sat
at
my
desk
,
in
my
own
particular
nook
,
thinking
of
this
earthquake
that
had
taken
place
so
unexpectedly
,
and
in
the
bitterness
of
my
spirit
cursing
Jip
,
I
fell
into
such
a
state
of
torment
about
Dora
,
that
I
wonder
I
did
not
take
up
my
hat
and
rush
insanely
to
Norwood
.
 
<EOS>
The
idea
of
their
frightening
her
,
and
making
her
cry
,
and
of
my
not
being
there
to
comfort
her
,
was
so
excruciating
,
that
it
impelled
me
to
write
a
wild
letter
to
Mr
Spenlow
,
beseeching
him
not
to
visit
upon
her
the
consequences
of
my
awful
destiny
.
 
<EOS>
I
implored
him
to
spare
her
gentle
nature
---
not
to
crush
a
fragile
flower
---
and
addressed
him
generally
,
to
the
best
of
my
remembrance
,
<EOS>
as
if
,
instead
of
being
her
father
,
he
had
been
an
Ogre
,
or
the
Dragon
of
Wantley.3
<EOS>
This
letter
I
sealed
and
laid
upon
his
desk
before
he
returned
;
and
when
he
came
in
,
I
saw
him
,
through
the
half
-
opened
door
of
his
room
,
take
it
up
and
read
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
about
it
all
the
morning
;
but
before
he
went
away
in
the
afternoon
he
called
me
in
,
and
told
me
that
I
need
not
make
myself
at
all
uneasy
about
his
daughter
's
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
assured
her
,
he
said
,
that
it
was
all
nonsense
;
and
he
had
nothing
more
to
say
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
believed
he
was
an
indulgent
father
<EOS>
(
as
indeed
he
was
)
,
and
I
might
spare
myself
any
solicitude
on
her
account
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
make
it
necessary
,
if
you
are
foolish
or
obstinate
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
he
observed
,
"
for
me
to
send
my
daughter
abroad
again
,
for
a
term
;
but
I
have
a
better
opinion
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
be
wiser
than
that
,
in
a
few
days
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
Miss
Murdstone
,
"
for
I
had
alluded
to
her
in
the
letter
,
"
I
respect
that
lady
's
vigilance
,
and
feel
obliged
to
her
;
but
she
has
strict
charge
to
avoid
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
desire
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
is
,
that
it
should
be
forgotten
.
 
<EOS>
All
you
have
got
to
do
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
is
to
forget
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
All
!
 
<EOS>
In
the
note
I
wrote
to
Miss
Mills
,
I
bitterly
quoted
this
sentiment
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
had
to
do
,
I
said
,
with
gloomy
sarcasm
,
was
to
forget
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
all
,
and
what
was
that
!
 
<EOS>
I
entreated
Miss
Mills
to
see
me
,
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
could
not
be
done
with
Mr
Mills
's
sanction
and
concurrence
,
I
besought
a
clandestine
interview
in
the
back
kitchen
where
the
Mangle
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
informed
her
that
my
reason
was
tottering
on
its
throne
,
and
only
she
,
Miss
Mills
,
could
prevent
its
being
deposed
.
 
<EOS>
I
signed
myself
,
hers
distractedly
;
and
I
could
n't
help
feeling
,
while
I
read
this
composition
over
,
before
sending
it
by
a
porter
,
that
it
was
something
in
the
style
of
Mr
Micawber
.
   
<EOS>
However
,
I
sent
it
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
I
repaired
to
Miss
Mills
's
street
,
and
walked
up
and
down
,
until
I
was
stealthily
fetched
in
by
Miss
Mills
's
maid
,
and
taken
the
area
way
to
the
back
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
since
seen
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
nothing
on
earth
to
prevent
my
going
in
at
the
front
door
,
and
being
shown
up
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
except
Miss
Mills
's
love
of
the
romantic
and
mysterious
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
back
kitchen
,
I
raved
as
became
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
there
,
I
suppose
,
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
,
and
I
am
quite
sure
I
did
it
.
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
had
received
a
hasty
note
from
Dora
,
telling
her
that
all
was
discovered
,
and
saying
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
pray
come
to
me
,
Julia
,
do
,
do
!
"
<EOS>
But
Miss
Mills
,
mistrusting
the
acceptability
of
her
presence
to
the
higher
powers
,
had
not
yet
gone
;
and
we
were
all
benighted
in
the
Desert
of
Sahara
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
had
a
wonderful
flow
of
words
,
and
liked
to
pour
them
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
feeling
,
though
she
mingled
her
tears
with
mine
,
that
she
had
a
dreadful
luxury
in
our
afflictions
.
 
<EOS>
She
petted
them
,
as
I
may
say
,
and
made
the
most
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
A
deep
gulf
,
she
observed
,
had
opened
between
Dora
and
me
,
and
Love
could
only
span
it
with
its
rainbow
.
 
<EOS>
Love
must
suffer
in
this
stern
world
;
it
ever
had
been
so
,
it
ever
would
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
No
matter
,
Miss
Mills
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
Hearts
confined
by
cobwebs
would
burst
at
last
,
and
then
Love
was
avenged
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
small
consolation
,
but
Miss
Mills
would
n't
encourage
fallacious
hopes
.
 
<EOS>
She
made
me
much
more
wretched
than
I
was
before
,
and
I
felt
(
and
told
her
with
the
deepest
gratitude
)
that
she
was
indeed
a
friend
.
 
<EOS>
We
resolved
that
she
should
go
to
Dora
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
,
and
find
some
means
of
assuring
her
,
either
by
looks
or
words
,
of
my
devotion
and
misery
.
 
<EOS>
We
parted
,
overwhelmed
with
grief
;
and
<EOS>
I
think
Miss
Mills
enjoyed
herself
completely
.
   
<EOS>
I
confided
all
to
my
aunt
when
I
got
home
;
and
in
spite
of
all
she
could
say
to
me
,
went
to
bed
despairing
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
up
despairing
,
and
went
out
despairing
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Saturday
morning
,
and
I
went
straight
to
the
Commons
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
surprised
,
when
I
came
within
sight
of
our
office
-
door
,
to
see
the
ticket
-
porters
standing
outside
talking
together
,
and
some
half
-
dozen
stragglers
gazing
at
the
windows
which
were
shut
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
quickened
my
pace
,
and
,
passing
among
them
,
wondering
at
their
looks
,
went
hurriedly
in
.
   
<EOS>
The
clerks
were
there
,
but
nobody
was
doing
anything
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Tiffey
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
I
should
think
,
was
sitting
on
somebody
else
's
stool
,
and
had
not
hung
up
his
hat
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
dreadful
calamity
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
said
he
,
as
I
entered
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
?
"
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
know
?
"
cried
Tiffey
,
and
all
the
rest
of
them
,
coming
round
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
looking
from
face
to
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
,
"
said
Tiffey
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
about
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dead
!
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
was
the
office
reeling
,
and
not
I
,
as
one
of
the
clerks
caught
hold
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
sat
me
down
in
a
chair
,
untied
my
neck
-
cloth
,
and
brought
me
some
water
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
idea
whether
this
took
any
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dead
?
"
said
I.
   
"
<EOS>
He
dined
in
town
yesterday
,
and
drove
down
in
the
phaeton
by
himself
,
"
said
Tiffey
,
"
having
sent
his
own
groom
home
by
the
coach
,
as
he
sometimes
did
,
you
know
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
Well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
phaeton
went
home
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
horses
stopped
at
the
stable
-
gate
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
went
out
with
a
lantern
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
in
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Had
they
run
away
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
were
not
hot
,
"
said
Tiffey
,
putting
on
his
glasses
;
"
no
hotter
,
I
understand
,
than
they
would
have
been
,
going
down
at
the
usual
pace
.
 
<EOS>
The
reins
were
broken
,
but
they
had
been
dragging
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
was
roused
up
directly
,
and
three
of
them
went
out
along
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
They
found
him
a
mile
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
More
than
a
mile
off
,
Mr
Tiffey
,
"
interposed
a
junior
.
   
<EOS>
"
Was
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
are
right
,
"
said
Tiffey
,
---
"
more
than
a
mile
off
---
not
far
from
the
church
---
lying
partly
on
the
roadside
,
and
partly
on
the
path
,
upon
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
he
fell
out
in
a
fit
,
or
got
out
,
feeling
ill
before
the
fit
came
on
---
or
even
whether
he
was
quite
dead
then
,
though
there
is
no
doubt
he
was
quite
insensible
---
no
one
appears
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
breathed
,
certainly
he
never
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
Medical
assistance
was
got
as
soon
as
possible
,
but
it
was
quite
useless
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
can
not
describe
the
state
of
mind
into
which
I
was
thrown
by
this
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
The
shock
of
such
an
event
happening
so
suddenly
,
and
happening
to
one
with
whom
I
had
been
in
any
respect
at
variance
---
the
appalling
vacancy
in
the
room
he
had
occupied
so
lately
,
where
his
chair
and
table
seemed
to
wait
for
him
,
and
his
handwriting
of
yesterday
was
like
a
ghost
---
the
indefinable
impossibility
of
separating
him
from
the
place
,
and
feeling
,
when
the
door
opened
,
as
if
he
might
come
in
---
the
lazy
hush
and
rest
<EOS>
there
was
in
the
office
,
and
the
insatiable
relish
with
which
our
people
talked
about
it
,
and
other
people
came
in
and
out
all
day
,
and
gorged
themselves
with
the
subject
---
this
is
easily
intelligible
to
anyone
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
can
not
describe
is
,
how
,
in
the
innermost
recesses
of
my
own
heart
,
I
had
a
lurking
jealousy
even
of
Death
.
 
<EOS>
How
I
felt
as
if
its
might
would
push
me
from
my
ground
in
Dora
's
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
How
I
was
,
in
a
grudging
way
I
have
no
words
for
,
envious
of
her
grief
.
 
<EOS>
How
it
made
me
restless
to
think
of
her
weeping
to
others
,
or
being
consoled
by
others
.
 
<EOS>
How
I
had
a
grasping
,
avaricious
wish
to
shut
out
everybody
from
her
but
myself
,
and
to
be
all
in
all
to
her
,
at
that
unseasonable
time
of
all
times
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
trouble
of
this
state
of
mind
---
not
exclusively
my
own
,
I
hope
,
but
known
to
others
---
I
went
down
to
Norwood
that
night
;
and
finding
from
one
of
the
servants
,
when
I
made
my
inquiries
at
the
door
,
that
Miss
Mills
was
there
,
got
my
aunt
to
direct
a
letter
to
her
,
which
I
wrote
.
 
<EOS>
I
deplored
the
untimely
death
of
Mr
Spenlow
,
most
sincerely
,
and
shed
tears
in
doing
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
entreated
her
to
tell
Dora
,
if
Dora
were
in
a
state
to
hear
it
,
that
he
had
spoken
to
me
with
the
utmost
kindness
and
consideration
;
and
had
coupled
nothing
but
tenderness
,
not
a
single
or
reproachful
word
,
with
her
name
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
I
did
this
selfishly
,
to
have
my
name
brought
before
her
;
but
I
tried
to
believe
it
was
an
act
of
justice
to
his
memory
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
did
believe
it
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
received
a
few
lines
next
day
in
reply
;
addressed
,
outside
,
to
her
;
within
,
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Dora
was
overcome
by
grief
;
and
when
her
friend
had
asked
her
should
she
send
her
love
to
me
,
had
only
cried
,
as
she
was
always
crying
,
"
Oh
,
dear
papa
!
<EOS>
oh
,
poor
papa
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
she
had
not
said
<EOS>
No
,
and
that
I
made
the
most
of
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
jorkins
,
who
had
been
at
Norwood
since
the
occurrence
,
came
to
the
office
a
few
days
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
Tiffey
were
closeted
together
for
some
few
moments
,
and
then
Tiffey
looked
out
at
the
door
and
beckoned
me
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Mr
jorkins
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Tiffey
and
myself
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
are
about
to
examine
the
desks
,
the
drawers
,
and
other
such
repositories
of
the
deceased
,
with
the
view
of
sealing
up
his
private
papers
,
and
searching
for
a
Will
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
trace
of
any
,
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
as
well
for
you
to
assist
us
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
had
been
in
agony
to
obtain
some
knowledge
of
the
circumstances
in
which
my
Dora
would
be
placed
---
as
,
in
whose
guardianship
,
and
so
forth
---
and
this
was
something
towards
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
began
the
search
at
once
;
Mr
jorkins
unlocking
the
drawers
and
desks
,
and
we
all
taking
out
the
papers
.
 
<EOS>
The
office
-
papers
we
placed
on
one
side
,
and
the
private
papers
(
which
were
not
numerous
)
on
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
very
grave
;
and
when
we
came
to
a
stray
seal
,
or
pencil
-
case
,
or
ring
,
or
any
little
article
of
that
kind
which
we
associated
personally
with
him
,
we
spoke
very
low
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
sealed
up
several
packets
;
and
were
still
going
on
dustily
and
quietly
,
when
Mr
jorkins
said
to
us
,
applying
exactly
the
same
words
to
his
late
partner
as
his
late
partner
had
applied
to
him
:
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Spenlow
was
very
difficult
to
move
from
the
beaten
track
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
what
he
was
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
disposed
to
think
he
had
made
no
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
know
he
had
!
"
said
I.
   
They
both
stopped
and
looked
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
the
very
day
when
I
last
saw
him
,
"
said
I
,
"
he
told
me
that
he
had
,
and
that
his
affairs
were
long
since
settled
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
jorkins
and
old
Tiffey
shook
their
heads
with
one
accord
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
looks
unpromising
,
"
said
Tiffey
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
unpromising
,
"
said
Mr
jorkins
.
   
<EOS>
"
Surely
you
do
n't
doubt
---
"
I
began
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
good
Mr
Copperfield
!
"
said
Tiffey
,
laying
his
hand
upon
my
arm
,
and
shutting
up
both
his
eyes
as
he
shook
his
head
:
"
if
you
had
been
in
the
Commons
as
long
as
I
have
,
you
would
know
that
there
is
no
subject
on
which
men
are
so
inconsistent
,
and
so
little
to
be
trusted
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
bless
my
soul
,
he
made
that
very
remark
!
<EOS>
"
I
replied
persistently
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
call
that
almost
final
,
"
observed
Tiffey
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
opinion
is
---
no
will
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
appeared
a
wonderful
thing
to
me
,
but
it
turned
out
that
there
was
no
will
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
never
so
much
as
thought
of
making
one
,
so
far
as
his
papers
afforded
any
evidence
;
for
there
was
no
kind
of
hint
,
sketch
,
or
memorandum
,
of
any
testamentary
intention
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
What
was
scarcely
less
astonishing
to
me
,
was
,
that
his
affairs
were
in
a
most
disordered
state
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
extremely
difficult
,
I
heard
,
to
make
out
what
he
owed
,
or
what
he
had
paid
,
or
of
what
he
died
possessed
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
considered
likely
that
for
years
he
could
have
had
no
clear
opinion
on
these
subjects
himself
.
 
<EOS>
By
little
and
little
it
came
out
,
that
,
in
the
competition
on
all
points
of
appearance
and
gentility
then
running
high
in
the
Commons
,
he
had
spent
more
than
his
professional
income
,
which
was
not
a
very
large
one
,
and
had
reduced
his
private
means
,
if
they
ever
had
been
great
(
which
was
exceedingly
doubtful
)
,
to
a
very
low
ebb
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
sale
of
the
furniture
and
lease
,
at
Norwood
;
and
Tiffey
told
me
,
little
thinking
how
interested
I
was
in
the
story
,
that
,
paying
all
the
just
debts
of
the
deceased
,
and
deducting
his
share
of
outstanding
bad
and
doubtful
debts
due
to
the
firm
,
he
would
n't
give
a
thousand
pounds
for
all
the
assets
remaining
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
at
the
expiration
of
about
six
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
suffered
tortures
all
the
time
;
and
thought
I
really
must
have
laid
violent
hands
upon
myself
,
when
Miss
Mills
still
reported
to
me
,
that
my
broken
-
hearted
little
Dora
would
say
nothing
,
when
I
was
mentioned
,
but
"
Oh
,
poor
papa
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
dear
papa
!
"
<EOS>
Also
,
that
she
had
no
other
relations
than
two
aunts
,
maiden
sisters
of
Mr
Spenlow
,
who
lived
at
Putney
,
and
who
had
not
held
any
other
than
chance
communication
with
their
brother
for
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
they
had
ever
quarrelled
(
Miss
Mills
informed
me
)
;
but
that
having
been
,
on
the
occasion
of
Dora
's
christening
,
invited
to
tea
,
when
they
considered
themselves
privileged
to
be
invited
to
dinner
,
they
had
expressed
their
opinion
in
writing
,
that
it
was
"
better
for
the
happiness
of
all
parties
"
that
they
should
stay
away
.
 
<EOS>
Since
which
they
had
gone
their
road
,
and
their
brother
had
gone
his
.
   
<EOS>
These
two
ladies
now
emerged
from
their
retirement
,
and
proposed
to
take
Dora
to
live
at
Putney
.
 
<EOS>
Dora
,
clinging
to
them
both
,
and
weeping
,
exclaimed
,
"
O
yes
,
aunts
!
 
<EOS>
Please
take
Julia
Mills
and
me
and
Jip
to
Putney
!
"
<EOS>
So
they
went
,
very
soon
after
the
funeral
.
   
<EOS>
How
I
found
time
to
haunt
Putney
,
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
;
but
I
contrived
,
by
some
means
or
other
,
to
prowl
about
the
neighbourhood
pretty
often
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
,
for
the
more
exact
discharge
of
the
duties
of
friendship
,
kept
a
journal
;
and
she
used
to
meet
me
sometimes
,
on
the
Common
,
and
read
it
,
or
(
if
she
had
not
time
to
do
that
)
lend
it
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
How
I
treasured
up
the
entries
,
of
which
I
subjoin
a
sample
!

Miss
Mills
and
her
journal
were
my
sole
consolation
at
this
period
.
<EOS>
To
see
her
,
who
had
seen
Dora
but
a
little
while
before
---
to
trace
the
initial
letter
of
Dora
's
name
through
her
sympathetic
pages
---
to
be
made
more
and
more
miserable
by
her
---
were
my
only
comforts
.
<EOS>
I
felt
as
if
I
had
been
living
in
a
palace
of
cards
,
which
had
tumbled
down
,
leaving
only
Miss
Mills
and
me
among
the
ruins
;
I
felt
as
if
some
grim
enchanter
had
drawn
a
magic
circle
round
the
innocent
goddess
of
my
heart
,
which
nothing
indeed
but
those
same
strong
pinions
,
capable
of
carrying
so
many
people
over
so
much
,
would
enable
me

enter

My
aunt
,
beginning
<EOS>
,
I
imagine
,
to
be
made
seriously
uncomfortable
by
my
prolonged
dejection
,
made
a
pretence
of
being
anxious
that
I
should
go
to
Dover
,
to
see
that
all
was
working
well
at
the
cottage
,
which
was
let
;
and
to
conclude
an
agreement
,
with
the
same
tenant
,
for
a
longer
term
of
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
Janet
was
drafted
into
the
service
of
Mrs
Strong
,
where
I
saw
her
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
undecided
,
on
leaving
Dover
,
whether
or
no
to
give
the
finishing
touch
to
that
renunciation
of
mankind
in
which
she
had
been
educated
,
by
marrying
a
pilot
;
but
she
decided
against
that
venture
.
 
<EOS>
Not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
principle
,
I
believe
,
as
because
she
happened
not
to
like
him
.
   
<EOS>
Although
it
required
an
effort
to
leave
Miss
Mills
,
I
fell
rather
willingly
into
my
aunt
's
pretence
,
as
a
means
of
enabling
me
to
pass
a
few
tranquil
hours
with
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
I
consulted
the
good
Doctor
relative
to
an
absence
of
three
days
;
and
the
Doctor
wishing
me
to
take
that
relaxation
,
---
he
wished
me
to
take
more
;
but
my
energy
could
not
bear
that
,
---
I
made
up
my
mind
to
go
.
   
<EOS>
As
to
the
Commons
,
I
had
no
great
occasion
to
be
particular
about
my
duties
in
that
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
To
say
the
truth
,
we
were
getting
in
no
very
good
odour
among
the
tip
-
top
proctors
,
and
were
rapidly
sliding
down
to
but
a
doubtful
position
.
 
<EOS>
The
business
had
been
indifferent
under
Mr
jorkins
,
before
Mr
Spenlow
's
time
;
and
although
it
had
been
quickened
by
the
infusion
of
new
blood
,
and
by
the
display
which
Mr
Spenlow
made
,
still
it
was
not
established
on
a
sufficiently
strong
basis
to
bear
,
without
being
shaken
,
such
a
blow
as
the
sudden
loss
of
its
active
manager
.
 
<EOS>
It
fell
off
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
jorkins
,
notwithstanding
his
reputation
in
the
firm
,
was
an
easy
-
going
,
incapable
sort
of
man
,
whose
reputation
out
of
doors
was
not
calculated
to
back
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
turned
over
to
him
now
,
and
when
I
saw
him
take
his
snuff
and
let
the
business
go
,
I
regretted
my
aunt
's
thousand
pounds
more
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
But
this
was
not
the
worst
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
a
number
of
hangers
-
on
and
outsiders
about
the
Commons
,
who
,
without
being
proctors
themselves
,
dabbled
in
common
-
form
business
,
and
got
it
done
by
real
proctors
,
who
lent
their
names
in
consideration
of
a
share
in
the
spoil
;
---
and
there
were
a
good
many
of
these
too
.
 
<EOS>
As
our
house
now
wanted
business
on
any
terms
,
we
joined
this
noble
band
;
and
threw
out
lures
to
the
hangers
-
on
and
outsiders
,
to
bring
their
business
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
Marriage
licences
and
small
probates
were
what
we
all
looked
for
,
and
what
paid
us
best
;
and
the
competition
for
these
ran
very
high
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Kidnappers
and
inveiglers
were
planted
in
all
the
avenues
of
entrance
to
the
Commons
,
with
instructions
to
do
their
utmost
to
cut
off
all
persons
in
mourning
,
and
all
gentlemen
with
anything
bashful
in
their
appearance
,
and
entice
them
to
the
offices
in
which
their
respective
employers
were
interested
;
which
instructions
were
so
well
observed
,
that
I
myself
,
before
I
was
known
by
sight
,
was
twice
hustled
into
the
premises
of
our
principal
opponent
.
 
<EOS>
The
conflicting
interests
of
these
touting
gentlemen
being
of
a
nature
to
irritate
their
feelings
,
personal
collisions
took
place
;
and
the
Commons
was
even
scandalized
by
our
principal
inveigler
(
who
had
formerly
been
in
the
wine
trade
,
and
afterwards
in
the
sworn
brokery
line
)
walking
about
for
some
days
with
a
black
eye
.
 
<EOS>
Any
one
of
these
scouts
used
to
think
nothing
of
politely
assisting
an
old
lady
in
black
out
of
a
vehicle
,
killing
any
proctor
whom
she
inquired
for
,
representing
his
employer
as
the
lawful
successor
and
representative
of
that
proctor
,
and
bearing
the
old
lady
off
(
sometimes
greatly
affected
)
to
his
employer
's
office
.
 
<EOS>
Many
captives
were
brought
to
me
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
marriage
licences
,
the
competition
rose
to
such
a
pitch
,
that
a
shy
gentleman
in
want
of
one
,
had
nothing
to
do
but
submit
himself
to
the
first
inveigler
,
or
be
fought
for
,
and
become
the
prey
of
the
strongest
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
our
clerks
,
who
was
an
outsider
,
used
,
in
the
height
of
this
contest
,
to
sit
with
his
hat
on
,
that
he
might
be
ready
to
rush
out
and
swear
before
a
surrogate
any
victim
who
was
brought
in
.
 
<EOS>
The
system
of
inveigling
continues
,
I
believe
,
to
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
The
last
time
I
was
in
the
Commons
,
a
civil
able
-
bodied
person
in
a
white
apron
pounced
out
upon
me
from
a
doorway
,
and
whispering
the
word
"
Marriage
-
licence
"
in
my
ear
,
was
with
great
difficulty
prevented
from
taking
me
up
in
his
arms
and
lifting
me
into
a
proctor
's
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
digression
,
let
me
proceed
to
Dover
.
   
<EOS>
I
found
everything
in
a
satisfactory
state
at
the
cottage
;
and
was
enabled
to
gratify
my
aunt
exceedingly
by
reporting
that
the
tenant
inherited
her
feud
,
and
waged
incessant
war
against
donkeys
.
<EOS>
Having
settled
the
little
business
I
had
to
transact
there
,
and
slept
there
one
night
,
I
walked
on
to
Canterbury
early
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
now
winter
again
;
and
the
fresh
,
cold
windy
day
,
and
the
sweeping
downland
,
brightened
up
my
hopes
a
little
.
   
<EOS>
Coming
into
Canterbury
,
I
loitered
through
the
old
streets
with
a
sober
pleasure
that
calmed
my
spirits
,
and
eased
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
the
old
signs
,
the
old
names
over
the
shops
,
the
old
people
serving
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
appeared
so
long
,
since
I
had
been
a
schoolboy
there
,
that
I
wondered
the
place
was
so
little
changed
,
until
I
reflected
how
little
I
was
changed
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Strange
to
say
,
that
quiet
influence
which
was
inseparable
in
my
mind
from
Agnes
,
seemed
to
pervade
even
the
city
where
she
dwelt
.
 
<EOS>
The
venerable
cathedral
towers
,
and
the
old
jackdaws
and
rooks
whose
airy
voices
made
them
more
retired
than
perfect
silence
would
have
done
;
the
battered
gateways
,
one
stuck
full
with
statues
,
long
thrown
down
,
and
crumbled
away
,
like
the
reverential
pilgrims
who
had
gazed
upon
them
;
the
still
nooks
,
where
the
ivied
growth
of
centuries
crept
over
gabled
ends
and
ruined
walls
;
the
ancient
houses
,
the
pastoral
landscape
of
field
,
orchard
,
and
garden
;
everywhere
---
on
everything
---
I
felt
the
same
serener
air
,
the
same
calm
,
thoughtful
,
softening
spirit
.
   
<EOS>
Arrived
at
Mr
Wickfield
's
house
,
I
found
,
in
the
little
lower
room
on
the
ground
floor
,
where
Uriah
Heep
had
been
of
old
accustomed
to
sit
,
Mr
Micawber
plying
his
pen
with
great
assiduity
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
a
legal
-
looking
suit
of
black
,
and
loomed
,
burly
and
large
,
in
that
small
office
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
was
extremely
glad
to
see
me
,
but
a
little
confused
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
conducted
me
immediately
into
the
presence
of
Uriah
,
but
I
declined
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
house
of
old
,
you
recollect
,
"
said
I
,
"
and
will
find
my
way
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
like
the
law
,
Mr
Micawber
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Copperfield
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
a
man
possessed
of
the
higher
imaginative
powers
,
the
objection
to
legal
studies
is
the
amount
of
detail
which
they
involve
.
 
<EOS>
Even
in
our
professional
correspondence
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
glancing
at
some
letters
he
was
writing
,
"
the
mind
is
not
at
liberty
to
soar
to
any
exalted
form
of
expression
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
it
is
a
great
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
pursuit
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
then
told
me
that
he
had
become
the
tenant
of
Uriah
Heep
's
old
house
;
and
that
Mrs
Micawber
would
be
delighted
to
receive
me
,
once
more
,
under
her
own
roof
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
humble
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
---
to
quote
a
favourite
expression
of
my
friend
Heep
;
but
it
may
prove
the
stepping
-
stone
to
more
ambitious
domiciliary
accommodation
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
asked
him
whether
he
had
reason
,
so
far
,
to
be
satisfied
with
his
friend
<EOS>
Heep
's
treatment
of
him
?
 
<EOS>
He
got
up
to
ascertain
if
the
door
were
close
shut
,
before
he
replied
,
in
a
lower
voice
:
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Copperfield
,
a
man
who
labours
under
the
pressure
of
pecuniary
embarrassments
,
is
,
with
the
generality
of
people
,
at
a
disadvantage
.
 
<EOS>
That
disadvantage
is
not
diminished
,
when
that
pressure
necessitates
the
drawing
of
stipendiary
emoluments
,
before
those
emoluments
are
strictly
due
and
payable
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
can
say
is
,
that
my
friend
Heep
has
responded
to
appeals
to
which
I
need
not
more
particularly
refer
,
in
a
manner
calculated
to
redound
equally
to
the
honour
of
his
head
,
and
of
his
heart
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
supposed
him
to
be
very
free
with
his
money
either
,
"
I
observed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
!

<EOS>
said
Mr
Micawber
,
with
an
air
of
constraint
,
"
I
speak
of
my
friend
Heep
as
I
have
experience
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
your
experience
is
so
favourable
,
"
I
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
obliging
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
;
and
hummed
a
tune
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
see
much
of
Mr
Wickfield
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
to
change
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
much
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
slightingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Wickfield
is
,
I
dare
say
,
a
man
of
very
excellent
intentions
;
but
he
is
---
in
short
,
he
is
obsolete
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
his
partner
seeks
to
make
him
so
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Copperfield
!
"
returned
Mr
Micawber
,
after
some
uneasy
evolutions
on
his
stool
,
"
allow
me
to
offer
a
remark
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
here
,
in
a
capacity
of
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
here
,
in
a
position
of
trust
.
<EOS>
The
discussion
of
some
topics
,
even
with
Mrs
Micawber
herself
(
so
long
the
partner
of
my
various
vicissitudes
,
and
a
woman
of
a
remarkable
lucidity
of
intellect
)
,
is
,
I
am
led
to
consider
,
incompatible
with
the
functions
now
devolving
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
therefore
take
the
liberty
of
suggesting
that
in
our
friendly
intercourse
---
which
I
trust
will
never
be
disturbed
!
<EOS>
---
we
draw
a
line
.
 
<EOS>
On
one
side
of
this
line
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
representing
it
on
the
desk
with
the
office
ruler
,
"
is
the
whole
range
of
the
human
intellect
,
with
a
trifling
exception
;
on
the
other
,
IS
that
exception
;
that
is
to
say
,
the
affairs
of
Messrs
Wickfield
and
Heep
,
with
all
belonging
and
appertaining
thereunto
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
I
give
no
offence
to
the
companion
of
my
youth
,
in
submitting
this
proposition
to
his
cooler
judgement
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Though
I
saw
an
uneasy
change
in
Mr
Micawber
,
which
sat
tightly
on
him
,
as
if
his
new
duties
were
a
misfit
,
I
felt
I
had
no
right
to
be
offended
.
 
<EOS>
My
telling
him
so
,
appeared
to
relieve
him
;
and
he
shook
hands
with
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
charmed
,
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
let
me
assure
you
,
with
Miss
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
a
very
superior
young
lady
,
of
very
remarkable
attractions
,
graces
,
and
virtues
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
honour
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
indefinitely
kissing
his
hand
and
bowing
with
his
genteelest
air
,
"
I
do
Homage
to
Miss
Wickfield
!
 
<EOS>
Hem
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
that
,
at
least
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
not
assured
us
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
on
the
occasion
of
that
agreeable
afternoon
we
had
the
happiness
of
passing
with
you
,
that
D
was
your
favourite
letter
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
I
should
unquestionably
have
supposed
that
A%
had
been
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
have
all
some
experience
of
a
feeling
,
that
comes
over
us
occasionally
,
of
what
we
are
saying
and
doing
having
been
said
and
done
before
,
in
a
remote
time
---
of
our
having
been
surrounded
,
dim
ages
ago
,
by
the
same
faces
,
objects
,
and
circumstances
---
of
our
knowing
perfectly
what
will
be
said
next
,
as
if
we
suddenly
remembered
it
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
had
this
mysterious
impression
more
strongly
in
my
life
,
than
before
he
uttered
those
words
.
   
<EOS>
I
took
my
leave
of
Mr
Micawber
,
for
the
time
,
charging
him
with
my
best
remembrances
to
all
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
left
him
,
resuming
his
stool
and
his
pen
,
and
rolling
his
head
in
his
stock
,
to
get
it
into
easier
writing
order
,
I
clearly
perceived
that
there
was
something
interposed
between
him
and
me
,
since
he
had
come
into
his
new
functions
,
which
prevented
our
getting
at
each
other
as
we
used
to
do
,
and
quite
altered
the
character
of
our
intercourse
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
one
in
the
quaint
old
drawing
-
room
,
though
it
presented
tokens
of
Mrs
Heep
's
whereabouts
.
 
<EOS>
I
looked
into
the
room
still
belonging
to
Agnes
,
and
saw
her
sitting
by
the
fire
,
at
a
pretty
old
-
fashioned
desk
she
had
,
writing
.
   
<EOS>
My
darkening
the
light
made
her
look
up
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
pleasure
to
be
the
cause
of
that
bright
change
in
her
attentive
face
,
and
the
object
of
that
sweet
regard
and
welcome
!
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Agnes
!
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
when
we
were
sitting
together
,
side
by
side
;
"
I
have
missed
you
so
much
,
lately
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
?
<EOS>
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Again
!
 
<EOS>
And
so
soon
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
shook
my
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
,
Agnes
;
I
seem
to
want
some
faculty
of
mind
that
I
ought
to
have
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
so
much
in
the
habit
of
thinking
for
me
,
in
the
happy
old
days
here
,
and
I
came
so
naturally
to
you
for
counsel
and
support
,
that
I
really
think
I
have
missed
acquiring
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
it
?
"
said
Agnes
,
cheerfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
to
call
it
,
"
I
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
am
earnest
and
persevering
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
it
,
"
said
Agnes
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
patient
,
Agnes
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
with
a
little
hesitation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
returned
Agnes
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
And
yet
,
"
said
I
,
"
I
get
so
miserable
and
worried
,
and
am
so
unsteady
and
irresolute
in
my
power
of
assuring
myself
,
<EOS>
that
I
know
I
must
want
<EOS>
---
shall
I
call
it
---
reliance
,
of
some
kind
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Call
it
so
,
if
you
will
,
"
said
Agnes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
I
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
See
here
!
 
<EOS>
You
come
to
London
,
I
rely
on
you
,
and
I
have
an
object
and
a
course
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
driven
out
of
it
,
I
come
here
,
and
in
a
moment
I
feel
an
altered
person
.
 
<EOS>
The
circumstances
that
distressed
me
are
not
changed
,
since
I
came
into
this
room
;
but
an
influence
comes
over
me
in
that
short
interval
that
alters
me
,
oh
,
how
much
for
the
better
!
 
<EOS>
What
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
your
secret
,
Agnes
?
"
   
<EOS>
Her
head
was
bent
down
,
looking
at
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
old
story
,
"
said
I.
 
"
Do
n't
laugh
,
when
I
say
it
was
always
the
same
in
little
things
as
it
is
in
greater
ones
.
 
<EOS>
My
old
troubles
were
nonsense
,
and
now
they
are
serious
;
but
whenever
I
have
gone
away
from
my
adopted
sister
---
"
   
Agnes
looked
up
---
with
such
a
Heavenly
face
!
---
and
gave
me
her
hand
,
which
I
kissed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Whenever
I
have
not
had
you
,
Agnes
,
to
advise
and
approve
in
the
beginning
,
I
have
seemed
to
go
wild
,
and
to
get
into
all
sorts
of
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
have
come
to
you
,
at
last
(
as
I
have
always
done
)
,
I
have
come
to
peace
and
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
home
,
now
,
like
a
tired
traveller
,
and
find
such
a
blessed
sense
of
rest
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
felt
so
deeply
what
I
said
,
it
affected
me
so
sincerely
,
that
my
voice
failed
,
and
I
covered
my
face
with
my
hand
,
and
broke
into
tears
.
 
<EOS>
I
write
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
contradictions
and
inconsistencies
there
were
within
me
,
as
there
are
within
so
many
of
us
;
whatever
might
have
been
so
different
,
and
so
much
better
;
whatever
I
had
done
,
in
which
I
had
perversely
wandered
away
from
the
voice
of
my
own
heart
;
I
knew
nothing
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
knew
that
I
was
fervently
in
earnest
,
when
I
felt
the
rest
and
peace
of
having
Agnes
near
me
.
   
<EOS>
In
her
placid
sisterly
manner
;
with
her
beaming
eyes
;
with
her
tender
voice
;
and
with
that
sweet
composure
,
which
had
long
ago
made
the
house
that
held
her
quite
a
sacred
place
to
me
;
she
soon
won
me
from
this
weakness
,
and
led
me
on
to
tell
all
that
had
happened
since
our
last
meeting
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
there
is
not
another
word
to
tell
,
Agnes
,
"
said
I
,
when
I
had
made
an
end
of
my
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
reliance
is
on
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
it
must
not
be
on
me
,
Trotwood
,
"
returned
Agnes
,
with
a
pleasant
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
on
someone
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
Dora
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Assuredly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
have
not
mentioned
,
Agnes
,
"
said
I
,
a
little
embarrassed
,
"
that
Dora
is
rather
difficult
to
---
<EOS>
I
would
not
,
for
the
world
,
say
,
to
rely
upon
,
because
she
is
the
soul
of
purity
and
truth
---
but
rather
difficult
to
---
I
hardly
know
how
to
express
it
,
really
,
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
a
timid
little
thing
,
and
easily
disturbed
and
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
Some
time
ago
,
before
her
father
's
death
,
when
I
thought
it
right
to
mention
to
her
---
but
I
'll
tell
you
,
if
you
will
bear
with
me
,
how
it
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
I
told
Agnes
about
my
declaration
of
poverty
,
about
the
cookery
-
book
,
the
housekeeping
accounts
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Trotwood
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
remonstrated
,
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Just
your
old
headlong
way
!
 
<EOS>
You
might
have
been
in
earnest
in
striving
to
get
on
in
the
world
,
without
being
so
very
sudden
with
a
timid
,
loving
,
inexperienced
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Dora
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
never
heard
such
sweet
forbearing
kindness
expressed
in
a
voice
,
as
she
expressed
in
making
this
reply
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
I
had
seen
her
admiringly
and
tenderly
embracing
Dora
,
and
tacitly
reproving
me
,
by
her
considerate
protection
,
for
my
hot
haste
in
fluttering
that
little
heart
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
I
had
seen
Dora
,
in
all
her
fascinating
artlessness
,
caressing
Agnes
,
and
thanking
her
,
and
coaxingly
appealing
against
me
,
and
loving
me
with
all
her
childish
innocence
.
   
<EOS>
I
felt
so
grateful
to
Agnes
,
and
admired
her
so
!
 
<EOS>
I
saw
those
two
together
,
in
a
bright
perspective
,
<EOS>
such
well
-
associated
friends
,
each
adorning
the
other
so
much
!
   
<EOS>
"
What
ought
I
to
do
then
,
Agnes
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
after
looking
at
the
fire
a
little
while
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
would
it
be
right
to
do
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
said
Agnes
,
"
that
the
honourable
course
to
take
,
would
be
to
write
to
those
two
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
that
any
secret
course
is
an
unworthy
one
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
If
YOU
think
so
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
poorly
qualified
to
judge
of
such
matters
,
"
replied
Agnes
,
with
a
modest
hesitation
,
"
but
I
certainly
feel
---
in
short
<EOS>
,
I
feel
that
your
being
secret
and
clandestine
,
is
not
being
like
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Like
myself
,
in
the
too
high
opinion
you
have
of
me
,
Agnes
,
I
am
afraid
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Like
yourself
,
in
the
candour
of
your
nature
,
"
she
returned
;
"
and
therefore
I
would
write
to
those
two
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
relate
,
as
plainly
and
as
openly
as
possible
,
all
that
has
taken
place
;
and
I
would
ask
their
permission
to
visit
sometimes
,
at
their
house
.
<EOS>
Considering
that
you
are
young
,
and
striving
for
a
place
in
life
,
I
think
it
would
be
well
to
say
that
you
would
readily
abide
by
any
conditions
they
might
impose
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
entreat
them
not
to
dismiss
your
request
,
without
a
reference
to
Dora
;
and
to
discuss
it
with
her
when
they
should
think
the
time
suitable
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
too
vehement
,
"
said
Agnes
,
gently
,
"
or
propose
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
trust
to
my
fidelity
and
perseverance
---
and
to
Dora
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
if
they
were
to
frighten
Dora
again
,
Agnes
,
by
speaking
to
her
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
And
if
Dora
were
to
cry
,
and
say
nothing
about
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
likely
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Agnes
,
with
the
same
sweet
consideration
in
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
her
,
she
is
as
easily
scared
as
a
bird
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
It
might
be
!
 
<EOS>
Or
if
the
two
Miss
Spenlows
(
elderly
ladies
of
that
sort
are
odd
characters
sometimes
)
should
not
be
likely
persons
to
address
in
that
way
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
,
Trotwood
,
"
returned
Agnes
,
raising
her
soft
eyes
to
mine
,
"
I
would
consider
that
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
would
be
better
only
to
consider
whether
it
is
right
to
do
this
;
and
,
if
it
is
,
to
do
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
had
no
longer
any
doubt
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
lightened
heart
,
though
with
a
profound
sense
of
the
weighty
importance
of
my
task
,
I
devoted
the
whole
afternoon
to
the
composition
of
the
draft
of
this
letter
;
for
which
great
purpose
,
Agnes
relinquished
her
desk
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
first
I
went
downstairs
to
see
Mr
Wickfield
and
Uriah
Heep
.
   
<EOS>
I
found
Uriah
in
possession
of
a
new
,
plaster
-
smelling
office
,
built
out
in
the
garden
;
looking
extraordinarily
mean
,
in
the
midst
of
a
quantity
of
books
and
papers
.
 
<EOS>
He
received
me
in
his
usual
fawning
way
,
and
pretended
not
to
have
heard
of
my
arrival
from
Mr
Micawber
;
a
pretence
I
took
the
liberty
of
disbelieving
.
 
<EOS>
He
accompanied
me
into
Mr
Wickfield
's
room
,
which
was
the
shadow
of
its
former
self
---
having
been
divested
of
a
variety
of
conveniences
,
for
the
accommodation
of
the
new
partner
---
and
stood
before
the
fire
,
warming
his
back
,
and
shaving
his
chin
with
his
bony
hand
,
while
Mr
Wickfield
<EOS>
and
I
exchanged
greetings
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
stay
with
us
,
Trotwood
,
while
you
remain
in
Canterbury
?
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
,
not
without
a
glance
at
Uriah
for
his
approval
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
room
for
me
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
Master
Copperfield
---
I
should
say
Mister
,
but
the
other
comes
so
natural
,
"
said
Uriah
,
---
<EOS>
"
I
would
turn
out
of
your
old
room
with
pleasure
,
if
it
would
be
agreeable
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
be
inconvenienced
?
<EOS>
There
's
another
room
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
another
room
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
you
know
,
"
returned
Uriah
,
with
a
grin
,
"
I
should
really
be
delighted
!
"
   
<EOS>
To
cut
the
matter
short
,
I
said
I
would
have
the
other
room
or
none
at
all
;
so
it
was
settled
that
I
should
have
the
other
room
;
and
,
taking
my
leave
of
the
firm
until
dinner
<EOS>
,
I
went
upstairs
again
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
hoped
to
have
no
other
companion
than
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Heep
had
asked
permission
to
bring
herself
and
her
knitting
near
the
fire
,
in
that
room
;
on
pretence
of
its
having
an
aspect
more
favourable
for
her
rheumatics
,
as
the
wind
then
was
,
than
the
drawing
-
room
or
dining
-
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
Though
I
could
almost
have
consigned
her
to
the
mercies
of
the
wind
on
the
topmost
pinnacle
of
the
Cathedral
,
without
remorse
,
I
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
,
and
gave
her
a
friendly
salutation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
umbly
thankful
to
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Heep
,
in
acknowledgement
of
my
inquiries
concerning
her
health
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
'm
only
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
n't
much
to
boast
of
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
could
see
my
Uriah
well
settled
in
life
,
I
could
n't
expect
much
more
I
think
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
think
my
Ury
looking
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
thought
him
looking
as
villainous
as
ever
,
and
I
replied
that
I
saw
no
change
in
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
do
n't
you
think
he
's
changed
?
"
said
Mrs
Heep
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
I
must
umbly
beg
leave
to
differ
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
a
thinness
in
him
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
more
than
usual
,
"
I
replied
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
though
!
"
said
Mrs
Heep
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
n't
take
notice
of
him
with
a
mother
's
eye
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
mother
's
eye
was
an
evil
eye
to
the
rest
of
the
world
<EOS>
,
I
thought
as
it
met
mine
,
howsoever
affectionate
to
him
;
and
I
believe
she
and
her
son
were
devoted
to
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
It
passed
me
,
and
went
on
to
Agnes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
YOU
see
a
wasting
and
a
wearing
in
him
,
Miss
Wickfield
?
"
inquired
Mrs
Heep
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Agnes
,
quietly
pursuing
the
work
on
which
she
was
engaged
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
too
solicitous
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
very
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Heep
,
with
a
prodigious
sniff
,
resumed
her
knitting
.
   
<EOS>
She
never
left
off
,
or
left
us
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
arrived
early
in
the
day
,
and
we
had
still
three
or
four
hours
before
dinner
;
but
she
sat
there
,
plying
her
knitting
-
needles
as
monotonously
as
an
hour
-
glass
might
have
poured
out
its
sands
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
on
one
side
of
the
fire
;
I
sat
at
the
desk
in
front
of
it
;
a
little
beyond
me
,
on
the
other
side
,
sat
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
Whensoever
,
slowly
pondering
over
my
letter
,
I
lifted
up
my
eyes
,
and
meeting
the
thoughtful
face
of
Agnes
,
saw
it
clear
,
and
beam
encouragement
upon
me
,
with
its
own
angelic
expression
,
I
was
conscious
presently
of
the
evil
eye
passing
me
,
and
going
on
to
her
,
and
coming
back
to
me
again
,
and
dropping
furtively
upon
the
knitting
.
 
<EOS>
What
the
knitting
was
,
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
,
not
being
learned
in
that
art
;
but
it
looked
like
a
net
;
and
as
she
worked
away
with
those
Chinese
chopsticks
of
knitting
-
needles
,
she
showed
in
the
firelight
like
an
ill
-
looking
enchantress
,
baulked
as
yet
by
the
radiant
goodness
opposite
,
but
getting
ready
for
a
cast
of
her
net
by
and
by
.
   
<EOS>
At
dinner
she
maintained
her
watch
,
with
the
same
unwinking
eyes
.
<EOS>
After
dinner
,
her
son
took
his
turn
;
and
when
Mr
Wickfield
,
himself
,
and
I
were
left
alone
together
,
leered
at
me
,
and
writhed
until
I
could
hardly
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
drawing
-
room
,
there
was
the
mother
knitting
and
watching
again
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
time
that
Agnes
sang
and
played
,
the
mother
sat
at
the
piano
.
 
<EOS>
Once
she
asked
for
a
particular
ballad
,
which
she
said
her
Ury
(
who
was
yawning
in
a
great
chair
)
doted
on
;
and
at
intervals
she
looked
round
at
him
,
and
reported
to
Agnes
that
he
was
in
raptures
with
the
music
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
hardly
ever
spoke
<EOS>
---
I
question
if
she
ever
did
---
without
making
some
mention
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
evident
to
me
that
this
was
the
duty
assigned
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
This
lasted
until
bedtime
.
 
<EOS>
To
have
seen
the
mother
and
son
,
like
two
great
bats
hanging
over
the
whole
house
,
and
darkening
it
with
their
ugly
forms
,
made
me
so
uncomfortable
,
that
I
would
rather
have
remained
downstairs
,
knitting
and
all
,
than
gone
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
got
any
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
the
knitting
and
watching
began
again
,
and
lasted
all
day
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
not
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
Agnes
,
for
ten
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
barely
show
her
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
proposed
to
her
to
walk
out
with
me
;
but
Mrs
Heep
repeatedly
complaining
that
she
was
worse
,
Agnes
charitably
remained
within
,
to
bear
her
company
.
 
<EOS>
Towards
the
twilight
I
went
out
by
myself
,
musing
on
what
I
ought
to
do
,
and
whether
I
was
justified
in
withholding
from
Agnes
,
any
longer
,
what
Uriah
Heep
had
told
me
in
London
;
for
that
began
to
trouble
me
again
,
very
much
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
not
walked
out
far
enough
to
be
quite
clear
of
the
town
,
upon
the
Ramsgate
road
,
where
there
was
a
good
path
,
when
I
was
hailed
,
through
the
dust
,
by
somebody
behind
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
shambling
figure
,
and
the
scanty
great
-
coat
,
were
not
to
be
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
I
stopped
,
and
Uriah
Heep
came
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
How
fast
you
walk
!
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
legs
are
pretty
long
,
but
you
've
given
'em
quite
a
job
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
with
you
,
Master
Copperfield
,
if
you
'll
allow
me
the
pleasure
of
a
walk
with
an
old
acquaintance
.
"
 
<EOS>
Saying
this
,
with
a
jerk
of
his
body
,
which
might
have
been
either
propitiatory
or
derisive
,
he
fell
into
step
beside
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Uriah
!
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
as
civilly
as
I
could
,
after
a
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Master
Copperfield
!
"
said
Uriah
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
tell
you
the
truth
(
at
which
you
will
not
be
offended
)
,
I
came
Out
to
walk
alone
,
because
I
have
had
so
much
company
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
sideways
,
and
said
with
his
hardest
grin
,
"
You
mean
mother
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
yes
,
I
do
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
But
you
know
we
're
so
very
umble
,
"
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
having
such
a
knowledge
of
our
own
umbleness
,
we
must
really
take
care
that
we
're
not
pushed
to
the
wall
by
them
as
is
n't
umble
.
 
<EOS>
All
stratagems
are
fair
in
love
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Raising
his
great
hands
until
they
touched
his
chin
,
he
rubbed
them
softly
,
and
softly
chuckled
;
looking
as
like
a
malevolent
baboon
,
I
thought
,
as
anything
human
could
look
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
he
said
,
still
hugging
himself
in
that
unpleasant
way
,
and
shaking
his
head
at
me
,
"
you
're
quite
a
dangerous
rival
,
Master
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
You
always
was
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
set
a
watch
upon
Miss
Wickfield
,
and
make
her
home
no
home
,
because
of
me
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
Master
Copperfield
!
 
<EOS>
Those
are
very
arsh
words
,
"
he
replied
.
   
<EOS>
"
Put
my
meaning
into
any
words
you
like
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
it
is
,
Uriah
,
as
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
!
 
<EOS>
You
must
put
it
into
words
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
really
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
myself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
suppose
,
"
said
I
,
constraining
myself
to
be
very
temperate
and
quiet
with
him
,
on
account
of
Agnes
,
"
that
I
regard
Miss
Wickfield
otherwise
than
as
a
very
dear
sister
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
he
replied
,
"
you
perceive
I
am
not
bound
to
answer
that
question
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
not
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
,
you
see
,
you
may
!
"
   
<EOS>
Anything
to
equal
the
low
cunning
of
his
visage
,
and
of
his
shadowless
eyes
without
the
ghost
of
an
eyelash
<EOS>
,
I
never
saw
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
then
!
"
<EOS>
said
I.
 
"
<EOS>
For
the
sake
of
Miss
Wickfield
---
"
   
"
My
Agnes
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
with
a
sickly
,
angular
contortion
of
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
you
be
so
good
<EOS>
as
call
her
Agnes
,
Master
Copperfield
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
the
sake
of
Agnes
Wickfield
---
Heaven
bless
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
for
that
blessing
,
Master
Copperfield
!
"
<EOS>
he
interposed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
I
should
,
under
any
other
circumstances
,
as
soon
have
thought
of
telling
to
---
Jack
Ketch
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
To
who
,
sir
?
"
said
Uriah
,
stretching
out
his
neck
,
and
shading
his
ear
with
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
the
hangman
,
"
I
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
most
unlikely
person
I
could
think
of
,
"
---
<EOS>
though
his
own
face
had
suggested
the
allusion
quite
as
a
natural
sequence
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
engaged
to
another
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
that
contents
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
your
soul
?
"
said
Uriah
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
about
indignantly
to
give
my
assertion
the
confirmation
he
required
,
when
he
caught
hold
of
my
hand
,
and
gave
it
a
squeeze
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Master
Copperfield
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
only
had
the
condescension
to
return
my
confidence
when
I
poured
out
the
fulness
of
my
art
,
the
night
I
put
you
so
much
out
of
the
way
by
sleeping
before
your
sitting
-
room
fire
,
I
never
should
have
doubted
you
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
I
'm
sure
I
'll
take
off
mother
directly
,
and
only
too
appy
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
'll
excuse
the
precautions
of
affection
,
wo
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
What
a
pity
,
Master
Copperfield
,
that
you
did
n't
condescend
to
return
my
confidence
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
gave
you
every
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
never
have
condescended
to
me
,
as
much
as
I
could
have
wished
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
have
never
liked
me
,
as
I
have
liked
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
All
this
time
he
was
squeezing
my
hand
with
his
damp
fishy
fingers
,
while
I
made
every
effort
I
decently
could
to
get
it
away
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
quite
unsuccessful
.
 
<EOS>
He
drew
it
under
the
sleeve
of
his
mulberry
-
coloured
great
-
coat
,
and
I
walked
on
,
almost
upon
compulsion
,
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
turn

"
said
Uriah
,
by
and
by
wheeling
me
face
about
towards
the
town
,
on
which
the
early
moon
was
now
shining
,
silvering
the
distant
windows
.
   
<EOS>
"
Before
we
leave
the
subject
,
you
ought
to
understand
,
"
said
I
,
breaking
a
pretty
long
silence
,
"
that
I
believe
Agnes
Wickfield
to
be
as
far
above
you
,
and
as
far
removed
from
all
your
aspirations
,
as
that
moon
herself
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Peaceful
!
 
<EOS>
Ai
n't
she
!
"
said
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
!
 
<EOS>
Now
confess
,
Master
Copperfield
,
that
you
have
n't
liked
me
quite
as
I
have
liked
you
.
<EOS>
All
along
you
've
thought
me
too
umble
now
<EOS>
,
I
should
n't
wonder
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
fond
of
professions
of
humility
,
"
I
returned
,
"
or
professions
of
anything
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
now
!
"
said
Uriah
,
looking
flabby
and
lead
-
coloured
in
the
moonlight
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
I
know
it
!
 
<EOS>
But
how
little
you
think
of
the
rightful
umbleness
of
a
person
in
my
station
,
Master
Copperfield
!
<EOS>
Father
and
me
was
both
brought
up
at
a
foundation
school
for
boys
;
and
mother
,
she
was
likewise
brought
up
at
a
public
,
sort
of
charitable
,
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
They
taught
us
all
a
deal
of
umbleness
---
not
much
else
that
I
know
of
,
from
morning
to
night
.
 
<EOS>
We
was
to
be
umble
to
this
person
,
and
umble
to
that
;
and
to
pull
off
our
caps
here
,
and
to
make
bows
there
;
and
always
to
know
our
place
,
and
abase
ourselves
before
our
betters
.
 
<EOS>
And
we
had
such
a
lot
of
betters
!
 
<EOS>
Father
got
the
monitor
-
medal
by
being
umble
.
 
<EOS>
So
did
I.
Father
got
made
a
sexton
by
being
umble
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
the
character
,
among
the
gentlefolks
,
of
being
such
a
well
-
behaved
man
,
that
they
were
determined
to
bring
him
in
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
umble
,
Uriah
,
"
says
father
to
me
,
"
and
you
'll
get
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
what
was
always
being
dinned
into
you
and
me
at
school
;
it
's
what
goes
down
best
.
 
<EOS>
Be
umble
,
"
says
father
,
"
and
you
'll
do
!
"
<EOS>
And
really
it
ai
n't
done
bad
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
it
had
ever
occurred
to
me
,
that
this
detestable
ca
nt
of
false
humility
might
have
originated
out
of
the
Heep
family
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
seen
the
harvest
,
but
had
never
thought
of
the
seed
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
was
quite
a
young
boy
,
"
said
Uriah
,
"
I
got
to
know
what
umbleness
did
,
and
I
took
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
ate
umble
pie
with
an
appetite
.
<EOS>
I
stopped
at
the
umble
point
of
my
learning
,
and
says
I
,
"
Hold
hard
!
"
<EOS>
When
you
offered
to
teach
me
Latin
,
I
knew
better
.
 
<EOS>
"
People
like
to
be
above
you
,
"
says
father
,
"
keep
yourself
down
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
umble
to
the
present
moment
,
Master
Copperfield
,
but
I
've
got
a
little
power
!
"
   
<EOS>
And
he
said
all
this
---
I
knew
,
as
I
saw
his
face
in
the
moonlight
---
that
I
might
understand
he
was
resolved
to
recompense
himself
by
using
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
never
doubted
his
meanness
,
his
craft
and
malice
;
but
I
fully
comprehended
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
what
a
base
,
unrelenting
,
and
revengeful
spirit
,
must
have
been
engendered
by
this
early
,
and
this
long
,
suppression
.
   
<EOS>
His
account
of
himself
was
so
far
attended
with
an
agreeable
result
,
that
it
led
to
his
withdrawing
his
hand
in
order
that
he
might
have
another
hug
of
himself
under
the
chin
.
 
<EOS>
Once
apart
from
him
,
I
was
determined
to
keep
apart
;
and
we
walked
back
,
side
by
side
,
saying
very
little
more
by
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
his
spirits
were
elevated
by
the
communication
I
had
made
to
him
,
or
by
his
having
indulged
in
this
retrospect
,
I
do
n't
know
;
but
they
were
raised
by
some
influence
.
 
<EOS>
He
talked
more
at
dinner
than
was
usual
with
him
;
asked
his
mother
(
off
duty
,
from
the
moment
of
our
re
-
entering
the
house
)
whether
he
was
not
growing
too
old
for
a
bachelor
;
and
once
looked
at
Agnes
so
,
that
I
would
have
given
all
I
had
,
for
leave
to
knock
him
down
.
   
<EOS>
When
we
three
males
were
left
alone
after
dinner
,
he
got
into
a
more
adventurous
state
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
taken
little
or
no
wine
;
and
I
presume
it
was
the
mere
insolence
of
triumph
that
was
upon
him
,
flushed
perhaps
by
the
temptation
my
presence
furnished
to
its
exhibition
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
observed
yesterday
,
that
he
tried
to
entice
Mr
Wickfield
to
drink
;
and
,
interpreting
the
look
which
Agnes
had
given
me
as
she
went
out
,
had
limited
myself
to
one
glass
,
and
then
proposed
that
we
should
follow
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
done
so
again
today
;
but
Uriah
was
too
quick
for
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
seldom
see
our
present
visitor
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
addressing
Mr
Wickfield
,
sitting
,
such
a
contrast
to
him
,
at
the
end
of
the
table
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
should
propose
to
give
him
welcome
in
another
glass
or
two
of
wine
,
if
you
have
no
objections
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
your
elth
and
appiness
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
make
a
show
of
taking
the
hand
he
stretched
across
to
me
;
and
then
,
with
very
different
emotions
,
I
took
the
hand
of
the
broken
gentleman
,
his
partner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
fellow
-
partner
,
"
said
Uriah
,
"
if
I
may
take
the
liberty
,
---
now
,
suppose
you
give
us
something
or
another
appropriate
to
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
pass
over
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
's
proposing
my
aunt
,
his
proposing
Mr
Dick
,
his
proposing
Doctors
'
Commons
,
his
proposing
Uriah
,
his
drinking
everything
twice
;
his
consciousness
of
his
own
weakness
,
the
ineffectual
effort
that
he
made
against
it
;
the
struggle
between
his
shame
in
Uriah
's
deportment
,
and
his
desire
to
conciliate
him
;
the
manifest
exultation
with
which
Uriah
twisted
and
turned
,
and
held
him
up
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
made
me
sick
at
heart
to
see
,
and
my
hand
recoils
from
writing
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
fellow
-
partner
!
"
said
Uriah
,
at
last
,
"
I
'll
give
you
another
one
,
and
I
umbly
ask
for
bumpers
,
seeing
I
intend
to
make
it
the
divinest
of
her
sex
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
father
had
his
empty
glass
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
him
set
it
down
,
<EOS>
look
at
the
picture
she
was
so
like
,
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
,
and
shrink
back
in
his
elbow
-
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
an
umble
individual
to
give
you
her
elth
,
"
proceeded
Uriah
,
"
but
<EOS>
I
admire
---
<EOS>
adore
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
No
physical
pain
that
her
father
's
grey
head
could
have
borne
,
I
think
,
could
have
been
more
terrible
to
me
,
than
the
mental
endurance
I
saw
compressed
now
within
both
his
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
Agnes
,
"
said
Uriah
,
either
not
regarding
him
,
or
not
knowing
what
the
nature
of
his
action
was
,
"
Agnes
Wickfield
is
,
I
am
safe
to
say
,
the
divinest
of
her
sex
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
speak
out
,
among
friends
?
 
<EOS>
To
be
her
father
is
a
proud
distinction
,
but
to
be
her
usband
---
"
   
Spare
me
from
ever
again
hearing
such
a
cry
,
as
that
with
which
her
father
rose
up
from
the
table
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
?
"
said
Uriah
,
turning
of
a
deadly
colour
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
gone
mad
,
after
all
,
Mr
Wickfield
,
I
hope
?
 
<EOS>
If
I
say
I
've
an
ambition
to
make
your
Agnes
my
Agnes
<EOS>
,
I
have
as
good
a
right
to
it
as
another
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
better
right
to
it
than
any
other
man
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
had
<EOS>
my
arms
round
Mr
Wickfield
,
imploring
him
by
everything
that
I
could
think
of
,
oftenest
of
all
by
his
love
for
Agnes
,
to
calm
himself
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
mad
for
the
moment
;
tearing
out
his
hair
,
beating
his
head
,
trying
to
force
me
from
him
,
and
to
force
himself
from
me
,
not
answering
a
word
,
not
looking
at
or
seeing
anyone
;
blindly
striving
for
<EOS>
he
knew
not
what
,
his
face
all
staring
and
distorted
---
a
frightful
spectacle
.
   
<EOS>
I
conjured
him
,
incoherently
,
but
in
the
most
impassioned
manner
,
not
to
abandon
himself
to
this
wildness
,
but
to
hear
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
besought
him
to
think
of
Agnes
,
to
connect
me
with
Agnes
,
to
recollect
how
Agnes
and
I
had
grown
up
together
<EOS>
,
how
I
honoured
her
and
loved
her
<EOS>
,
how
she
was
his
pride
and
joy
.
 
<EOS>
I
tried
to
bring
her
idea
before
him
in
any
form
;
I
even
reproached
him
with
not
having
firmness
to
spare
her
the
knowledge
of
such
a
scene
as
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
effected
something
,
or
his
wildness
may
have
spent
itself
;
but
by
degrees
he
struggled
less
,
and
began
to
look
at
me
---
strangely
at
first
,
then
with
recognition
in
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
said
,
"
I
know
,
Trotwood
!
 
<EOS>
My
darling
child
and
you
<EOS>
---
I
know
!
 
<EOS>
But
look
at
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
pointed
to
Uriah
,
pale
and
glowering
in
a
corner
,
evidently
very
much
out
in
his
calculations
,
and
taken
by
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
at
my
torturer
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Before
him
I
have
step
by
step
abandoned
name
and
reputation
,
peace
and
quiet
,
house
and
home
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
kept
your
name
and
reputation
for
you
,
and
your
peace
and
quiet
,
and
your
house
and
home
too
,
"
said
Uriah
,
with
a
sulky
,
hurried
,
defeated
air
of
compromise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
foolish
,
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
have
gone
a
little
beyond
what
you
were
prepared
for
<EOS>
,
I
can
go
back
,
I
suppose
?
 
<EOS>
There
's
no
harm
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
looked
for
single
motives
in
everyone
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
was
satisfied
I
had
bound
him
to
me
by
motives
of
interest
.
 
<EOS>
But
see
what
he
is
<EOS>
---
oh
,
see
what
he
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
stop
him
,
Copperfield
,
if
you
can
,
"
cried
Uriah
,
with
his
long
forefinger
pointing
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
'll
say
something
presently
---
<EOS>
mind
you
!
<EOS>
---
he
'll
be
sorry
to
have
said
afterwards
,
and
you
'll
be
sorry
to
have
heard
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
say
anything
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Wickfield
,
with
a
desperate
air
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
not
be
in
all
the
world
's
power
if
I
am
in
yours
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mind
!
<EOS>
I
tell
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
Uriah
,
continuing
to
warn
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
stop
his
mouth
,
you
're
not
his
friend
!
 
<EOS>
Why
should
n't
you
be
in
all
the
world
's
power
,
Mr
Wickfield
?
 
<EOS>
Because
you
have
got
a
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
You
and
me
know
what
we
know
,
do
n't
we
?
 
<EOS>
Let
sleeping
dogs
lie
---
who
wants
to
rouse
'em
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
see
I
am
as
umble
as
I
can
be
?
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
if
I
've
gone
too
far
,
I
'm
sorry
.
<EOS>
What
would
you
have
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Trotwood
,
Trotwood
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Wickfield
,
wringing
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
I
have
come
down
to
be
,
since
I
first
saw
you
in
this
house
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
on
my
downward
way
then
,
but
the
dreary
,
dreary
road
I
have
traversed
since
!
 
<EOS>
Weak
indulgence
has
ruined
me
.
 
<EOS>
Indulgence
in
remembrance
,
and
indulgence
in
forgetfulness
.
 
<EOS>
My
natural
grief
for
my
child
's
mother
turned
to
disease
;
my
natural
love
for
my
child
turned
to
disease
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
infected
everything
I
touched
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
brought
misery
on
what
I
dearly
love
<EOS>
,
I
know
---
you
know
!
 
<EOS>
I
thought
it
possible
that
I
could
truly
love
one
creature
in
the
world
,
and
not
love
the
rest
;
I
thought
it
possible
that
I
could
truly
mourn
for
one
creature
gone
out
of
the
world
,
and
not
have
some
part
in
the
grief
of
all
who
mourned
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
the
lessons
of
my
life
have
been
perverted
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
preyed
on
my
own
morbid
coward
heart
,
and
it
has
preyed
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
Sordid
in
my
grief
,
sordid
in
my
love
,
sordid
in
my
miserable
escape
from
the
darker
side
of
both
,
<EOS>
oh
see
the
ruin
I
am
,
and
hate
me
,
shun
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
dropped
into
a
chair
,
and
weakly
sobbed
.
 
<EOS>
The
excitement
into
which
he
had
been
roused
was
leaving
him
.
 
<EOS>
Uriah
came
out
of
his
corner
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
all
I
have
done
,
in
my
fatuity
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
,
putting
out
his
hands
,
as
if
to
deprecate
my
condemnation
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
knows
best
,
"
meaning
Uriah
Heep
,
"
for
he
has
always
been
at
my
elbow
,
whispering
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
the
millstone
that
he
is
about
my
neck
.
 
<EOS>
You
find
him
in
my
house
,
you
find
him
in
my
business
.
 
<EOS>
You
heard
him
,
but
a
little
time
ago
.
 
<EOS>
What
need
have
I
to
say
more
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
need
to
say
so
much
,
nor
half
so
much
,
nor
anything
at
all
,
"
observed
Uriah
,
half
defiant
,
and
half
fawning
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
have
took
it
up
<EOS>
so
,
if
it
had
n't
been
for
the
wine
.
<EOS>
You
'll
think
better
of
it
tomorrow
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
have
said
too
much
,
or
more
than
I
meant
,
what
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
n't
stood
by
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
door
opened
,
and
Agnes
,
gliding
in
,
without
a
vestige
of
colour
in
her
face
,
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
,
and
steadily
said
,
"
Papa
,
you
are
not
well
.
 
<EOS>
Come
with
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
laid
his
head
upon
her
shoulder
,
as
if
he
were
oppressed
with
heavy
shame
,
and
went
out
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eyes
met
mine
for
but
an
instant
,
yet
I
saw
how
much
she
knew
of
what
had
passed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
expect
he
'd
cut
up
so
rough
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
said
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
be
friends
with
him
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
It
's
for
his
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
umbly
anxious
for
his
good
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
gave
him
no
answer
,
and
went
upstairs
into
the
quiet
room
where
Agnes
had
so
often
sat
beside
me
at
my
books
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
came
near
me
until
late
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
up
a
book
,
and
tried
to
read
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
the
clocks
strike
twelve
,
and
was
still
reading
,
without
knowing
what
I
read
,
when
Agnes
touched
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
going
early
in
the
morning
,
Trotwood
!
 
<EOS>
Let
us
say
good
-
bye
,
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
had
been
weeping
,
but
her
face
then
was
so
calm
and
beautiful
!
   
<EOS>
"
Heaven
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
giving
me
her
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dearest
Agnes
!
<EOS>
"
I
returned
,
"
I
see
you
ask
me
not
to
speak
of
tonight
---
but
is
there
nothing
to
be
done
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
God
to
trust
in
!
"
<EOS>
she
replied
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
I
do
nothing
---
<EOS>
I
,
who
come
to
you
with
my
poor
sorrows
?
"
   
"
<EOS>
And
make
mine
so
much
lighter
,
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
Trotwood
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Agnes
,
"
I
said
,
"
it
is
presumptuous
for
me
,
who
am
so
poor
in
all
in
which
you
are
so
rich
---
<EOS>
goodness
,
resolution
,
all
noble
qualities
---
to
doubt
or
direct
you
;
<EOS>
but
you
know
how
much
I
love
you
,
and
how
much
I
owe
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
never
sacrifice
yourself
to
a
mistaken
sense
of
duty
,
Agnes
?
"
   
<EOS>
More
agitated
for
a
moment
than
I
had
ever
seen
her
,
she
took
her
hands
from
me
,
and
moved
a
step
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
Say
you
have
no
such
thought
,
dear
Agnes
!
 
<EOS>
Much
more
than
sister
!
<EOS>
Think
of
the
priceless
gift
of
such
a
heart
as
yours
,
of
such
a
love
as
yours
!
"
   
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
long
,
long
afterwards
,
I
saw
that
face
rise
up
before
me
,
with
its
momentary
look
,
not
wondering
,
not
accusing
,
not
regretting
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
long
,
long
afterwards
,
I
saw
that
look
subside
,
as
it
did
now
,
into
the
lovely
smile
,
with
which
she
told
me
she
had
no
fear
for
herself
---
I
need
have
none
for
her
---
and
parted
from
me
by
the
name
of
Brother
,
and
was
gone
!
   
<EOS>
It
was
dark
in
the
morning
,
when
I
got
upon
the
coach
at
the
inn
door
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
was
just
breaking
when
we
were
about
to
start
,
and
then
,
as
I
sat
thinking
of
her
,
came
struggling
up
the
coach
side
,
through
the
mingled
day
and
night
,
Uriah
's
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Copperfield
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
in
a
croaking
whisper
,
<EOS>
as
he
hung
by
the
iron
on
the
roof
,
"
I
thought
you
'd
be
glad
to
hear
before
you
went
off
,
that
there
are
no
squares
broke
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
been
into
his
room
already
,
and
we
've
made
it
all
smooth
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
though
I
'm
umble
,
I
'm
useful
to
him
,
you
know
;
and
he
understands
his
interest
when
he
is
n't
in
liquor
!
 
<EOS>
What
an
agreeable
man
he
is
,
after
all
,
Master
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
obliged
myself
to
say
that
I
was
glad
he
had
made
his
apology
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
to
be
sure
!
"
said
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
a
person
's
umble
,
you
know
,
what
's
an
apology
?
 
<EOS>
So
easy
!
 
<EOS>
I
say
!
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
"
with
a
jerk
,
"
you
have
sometimes
plucked
a
pear
before
it
was
ripe
,
Master
Copperfield
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
have
,
"
I
replied
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
that
last
night
,
"
said
Uriah
;
"
but
it
'll
ripen
yet
!
 
<EOS>
It
only
wants
attending
to
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
wait
!
"
   
<EOS>
Profuse
in
his
farewells
<EOS>
,
he
got
down
again
as
the
coachman
got
up
.
<EOS>
For
anything
I
know
,
he
was
eating
something
to
keep
the
raw
morning
air
out
;
but
he
made
motions
with
his
mouth
as
if
the
pear
were
ripe
already
,
and
he
were
smacking
his
lips
over
it
.

Chapter
40
.
<EOS>
The
wanderer
 
<EOS>
We
had
a
very
serious
conversation
in
Buckingham
Street
that
night
,
about
the
domestic
occurrences
I
have
detailed
in
the
last
chapter
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
was
deeply
interested
in
them
,
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
her
arms
folded
,
for
more
than
two
hours
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Whenever
she
was
particularly
discomposed
,
she
always
performed
one
of
these
pedestrian
feats
;
and
the
amount
of
her
discomposure
might
always
be
estimated
by
the
duration
of
her
walk
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
she
was
so
much
disturbed
in
mind
as
to
find
it
necessary
to
open
the
bedroom
door
,
and
make
a
course
for
herself
,
comprising
the
full
extent
of
the
bedrooms
from
wall
to
wall
;
and
while
Mr
Dick
and
I
sat
quietly
by
the
fire
,
she
kept
passing
in
and
out
,
along
this
measured
track
,
at
an
unchanging
pace
,
with
the
regularity
of
a
clock
-
pendulum
.
   
<EOS>
When
my
aunt
and
I
were
left
to
ourselves
by
Mr
Dick
's
going
out
to
bed
,
I
sat
down
to
write
my
letter
to
the
two
old
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
By
that
time
she
was
tired
of
walking
,
and
sat
by
the
fire
with
her
dress
tucked
up
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
But
instead
of
sitting
in
her
usual
manner
,
holding
her
glass
upon
her
knee
,
she
suffered
it
to
stand
neglected
on
the
chimney
-
piece
;
and
,
resting
her
left
elbow
on
her
right
arm
,
and
her
chin
on
her
left
hand
,
looked
thoughtfully
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
As
often
as
I
raised
my
eyes
from
what
I
was
about
,
I
met
hers
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
in
the
lovingest
of
tempers
,
my
dear
,
"
she
would
assure
me
with
a
nod
,
"
but
I
am
fidgeted
and
sorry
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
had
been
too
busy
to
observe
,
until
after
she
was
gone
to
bed
,
that
she
had
left
her
night
-
mixture
,
as
she
always
called
it
,
untasted
on
the
chimney
-
piece
.
 
<EOS>
She
came
to
her
door
,
with
even
more
than
her
usual
affection
of
manner
,
when
I
knocked
to
acquaint
her
with
this
discovery
;
but
only
said
,
"
I
have
not
the
heart
to
take
it
,
Trot
,
tonight
,
"
and
shook
her
head
,
and
went
in
again
.
   
<EOS>
She
read
my
letter
to
the
two
old
ladies
,
in
the
morning
,
and
approved
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
posted
it
,
and
had
nothing
to
do
then
,
but
wait
,
as
patiently
as
I
could
,
for
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
still
in
this
state
of
expectation
,
and
had
been
,
for
nearly
a
week
;
when
I
left
the
Doctor
's
one
snowy
night
,
to
walk
home
.
   
<EOS>
It
had
been
a
bitter
day
,
and
a
cutting
north
-
east
wind
had
blown
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
wind
had
gone
down
with
the
light
,
and
so
the
snow
had
come
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
heavy
,
settled
fall
,
I
recollect
,
in
great
flakes
;
and
it
lay
thick
.
 
<EOS>
The
noise
of
wheels
and
tread
of
people
were
as
hushed
,
as
if
the
streets
had
been
strewn
that
depth
with
feathers
.
   
<EOS>
My
shortest
way
home
,
---
and
I
naturally
took
the
shortest
way
on
such
a
night
---
was
through
St
Martin
's
Lane
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
the
church
which
gives
its
name
to
the
lane
,
stood
in
a
less
free
situation
at
that
time
;
there
being
no
open
space
before
it
,
and
the
lane
winding
down
to
the
Strand
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
passed
the
steps
of
the
portico
,
I
encountered
,
at
the
corner
,
a
woman
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
It
looked
in
mine
,
passed
across
the
narrow
lane
,
and
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
seen
it
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
remember
where
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
some
association
with
it
,
that
struck
upon
my
heart
directly
;
but
I
was
thinking
of
anything
else
when
it
came
upon
me
,
and
was
confused
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
steps
of
the
church
,
there
was
the
stooping
figure
of
a
man
,
who
had
put
down
some
burden
on
the
smooth
snow
,
to
adjust
it
;
my
seeing
the
face
,
and
my
seeing
him
,
were
simultaneous
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
had
stopped
in
my
surprise
;
but
,
in
any
case
,
as
I
went
on
,
he
rose
,
turned
,
and
came
down
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
stood
face
to
face
with
Mr
Peggotty
!
   
<EOS>
Then
I
remembered
the
woman
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Martha
,
to
whom
Emily
had
given
the
money
that
night
in
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
Martha
Endell
---
side
by
side
with
whom
,
he
would
not
have
seen
his
dear
niece
<EOS>
,
Ham
had
told
me
,
for
all
the
treasures
wrecked
in
the
sea
.
   
<EOS>
We
shook
hands
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
neither
of
us
could
speak
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mas'r
Davy
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
gripping
me
tight
,
"
it
do
my
art
good
to
see
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Well
met
,
well
met
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
met
,
my
dear
old
friend
!
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
my
thowts
<EOS>
o
'
coming
to
make
inquiration
for
you
,
sir
<EOS>
,
tonight
,
"
he
said
,
"
but
knowing
as
your
aunt
was
living
along
wi
'
you
---
fur
<EOS>
I
've
been
down
yonder
---
<EOS>
Yarmouth
way
<EOS>
---
I
was
afeerd
<EOS>
it
was
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
come
early
in
the
morning
,
sir
,
afore
going
away
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Again
?
"
said
I.
   
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
he
replied
,
patiently
shaking
his
head
,
"
I
'm
away
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
were
you
going
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
<EOS>
he
replied
,
shaking
the
snow
out
of
his
long
hair
,
"
I
was
a
-
going
to
turn
in
somewheers
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
those
days
there
was
a
side
-
entrance
to
the
stable
-
yard
of
the
Golden
Cross
,
the
inn
<EOS>
so
memorable
to
me
in
connexion
with
his
misfortune
,
nearly
opposite
to
where
we
stood
.
 
<EOS>
I
pointed
out
the
gateway
,
put
my
arm
through
his
,
and
we
went
across
.
 
<EOS>
Two
or
three
public
-
rooms
opened
out
of
the
stable
-
yard
;
and
looking
into
one
of
them
,
and
finding
it
empty
,
and
a
good
fire
burning
,
I
took
him
in
there
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
saw
him
in
the
light
,
I
observed
,
not
only
that
his
hair
was
long
and
ragged
,
but
that
his
face
was
burnt
dark
by
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
greyer
,
the
lines
in
his
face
and
forehead
were
deeper
,
and
he
had
every
appearance
of
having
toiled
and
wandered
through
all
varieties
of
weather
;
but
he
looked
very
strong
,
and
like
a
man
upheld
by
steadfastness
of
purpose
,
whom
nothing
could
tire
out
.
<EOS>
He
shook
the
snow
from
his
hat
and
clothes
,
and
brushed
it
away
from
his
face
,
while
I
was
inwardly
making
these
remarks
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
sat
down
opposite
to
me
at
a
table
,
with
his
back
to
the
door
by
which
we
had
entered
,
he
put
out
his
rough
hand
again
,
and
grasped
mine
warmly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
he
said
,
---
"
<EOS>
wheer
all
I
've
been
,
and
what
-
all
we
've
heerd
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
been
fur
,
and
we

heerd
little
;
but
I
'll
tell
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
rang
the
bell
for
something
hot
to
drink
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
nothing
stronger
than
ale
;
and
while
it
was
being
brought
,
and
being
warmed
at
the
fire
,
he
sat
thinking
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
fine
,
massive
gravity
in
his
face
,
I
did
not
venture
to
disturb
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
she
was
a
child
,
"
he
said
,
lifting
up
his
head
soon
after
we
were
left
alone
,
"
she
used
to
talk
to
me
a
deal
about
the
sea
,
and
about
them
coasts
where
the
sea
got
to
be
dark
blue
,
and
to
lay
a
-
shining
and
a
-
shining
in
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
I
thowt
,
<EOS>
odd
times
,
as
her
father
being
drownded
made
her
think
on
it
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
doen't
know
,
you
see
,
<EOS>
but
maybe
she
believed
---
or
hoped
---
he
had
drifted
out
to
them
parts
,
where
the
flowers
is
always
a
-
blowing
,
and
the
country
bright
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
likely
to
have
been
a
childish
fancy
,
"
I
replied
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
she
was
---
lost
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
I
know'd
<EOS>
in
my
mind
,
as
he
would
take
her
to
them
countries
.
 
<EOS>
I
know'd
<EOS>
in
my
mind
,
as
he
'd
have
told
her
wonders
of
'em
,
and
how
she
was
to
be
a
lady
theer
,
and
how
he
got
her
to
listen
to
him
fust
,
along
o
'
sech
like
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
see
his
mother
,
I
know'd
<EOS>
quite
well
as
I
was
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
across
-
channel
to
France
,
and
landed
theer
,
as
if
I
'd
fell
down
from
the
sky
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
saw
the
door
move
,
and
the
snow
drift
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
it
move
a
little
more
,
and
a
hand
softly
interpose
to
keep
it
open
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
found
out
an
English
gen'leman
as
was
in
authority
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
and
told
him
I
was
a
-
going
to
seek
my
niece
.
 
<EOS>
He
got
me
them
papers
as
I
wanted
fur
to
carry
me
through
---
<EOS>
I
doen't
rightly
know
how
they
're
called
---
and
he
would
have
give
me
money
,
but
that
I
was
thankful
to
have
no
need
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
him
kind
,
for
all
he
done
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
!
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
wrote
afore
you
,
"
he
says
to
me
,
"
and
I
shall
speak
to
many
as
will
come
that
way
,
and
many
will
know
you
,
fur
distant
from
here
,
when
you
're
a
-
travelling
alone
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
him
,
best
as
I
was
able
,
what
my
gratitoode
was
,
and
went
away
through
France
.
"
   
"
Alone
,
and
on
foot
?
"
said
I.
   
"
Mostly
a
-
foot
,
"
he
rejoined
;
"
sometimes
in
carts
along
with
people
going
to
market
;
sometimes
in
empty
coaches
.
 
<EOS>
Many
mile
a
day
<EOS>
a
-
foot
,
and
often
with
some
poor
soldier
or
another
,
travelling
to
see
his
friends
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
talk
to
him
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
nor
he
to
me
;
but
we
was
company
for
one
another
,
too
,
along
the
dusty
roads
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
should
have
known
that
by
his
friendly
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
come
to
any
town
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
I
found
the
inn
,
and
waited
about
the
yard
till
someone
turned
up
(
someone
mostly
did
)
as
know'd
English
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
told
how
that
I
was
on
my
way
to
seek
my
niece
,
and
they
told
me
what
manner
of
gentlefolks
was
in
the
house
,
and
I
waited
to
see
any
as
seemed
like
her
,
going
in
or
out
.
<EOS>
When
it
warn't
Em'ly
,
I
went
on
agen
.
 
<EOS>
By
little
and
little
,
when
I
come
to
a
new
village
or
that
,
among
the
poor
people
,
I
found
they
know'd
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
set
me
down
at
their
cottage
doors
,
and
give
me
what
-
not
fur
to
eat
and
drink
,
and
show
me
where
to
sleep
;
and
many
a
woman
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
as
has
had
a
daughter
of
about
Em'ly
's
age
,
I
've
found
a
-
waiting
fur
me
,
at
Our
Saviour
's
Cross
outside
the
village
,
fur
to
do
me
sim'lar
kindnesses
.
 
<EOS>
Some
has
had
daughters
as
was
dead
.
 
<EOS>
And
God
only
knows
how
good
them
mothers
was
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
Martha
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
her
haggard
,
listening
face
distinctly
.
 
<EOS>
My
dread
was
lest
he
should
turn
his
head
,
and
see
her
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
would
often
put
their
children
---
particular
their
little
girls
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
upon
my
knee
;
and
many
a
time
you
might
have
seen
me
sitting
at
their
doors
,
when
night
was
coming
in
,
a'most
as
if
they
'd
been
my
Darling
's
children
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
Darling
!
"
   
<EOS>
Overpowered
by
sudden
grief
,
he
sobbed
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
I
laid
my
trembling
hand
upon
the
hand
he
put
before
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thankee
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
"
doen't
take
no
notice
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
a
very
little
while
he
took
his
hand
away
and
put
it
on
his
breast
,
and
went
on
with
his
story
.
<EOS>
"
They
often
walked
with
me
,
"
he
said
,
"
in
the
morning
,
maybe
a
mile
or
two
upon
my
road
;
and
when
we
parted
,
and
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
I
'm
very
thankful
to
you
!
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
they
always
seemed
to
understand
,
and
answered
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
I
come
to
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
It
warn't
<EOS>
hard
,
you
may
suppose
,
for
a
seafaring
man
like
me
to
work
his
way
over
to
Italy
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
got
theer
,
I
wandered
on
as
I
had
done
afore
.
<EOS>
The
people
was
just
as
good
to
me
,
and
I
should
have
gone
from
town
to
town
,
maybe
the
country
through
,
but
that
I
got
news
of
her
being
seen
among
them
Swiss
mountains
yonder
.
 
<EOS>
One
as
know'd
<EOS>
his
servant
see
'em
there
,
all
three
,
and
told
me
how
they
travelled
,
and
where
they
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
fur
them
mountains
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
day
and
night
.
 
<EOS>
Ever
so
fur
<EOS>
as
I
went
,
ever
so
fur
the
mountains
seemed
to
shift
away
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
come
up
with
'em
,
and
I
crossed
'em
.
<EOS>
When
I
got
nigh
the
place
as
I
had
been
told
of
,
I
began
to
think
within
my
own
self
,
"
What
shall
I
do
when
I
see
her
?
"
<EOS>
"
   
The
listening
face
,
insensible
to
the
inclement
night
,
still
drooped
at
the
door
,
and
the
hands
begged
me
---
prayed
me
---
not
to
cast
it
forth
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
doubted
her
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
!
 
<EOS>
Not
a
bit
!
 
<EOS>
On'y
let
her
see
my
face
---
<EOS>
on'y
let
her
beer
my
voice
---
on'y
let
my
stanning
still
afore
her
bring
to
her
thoughts
<EOS>
the
home
she
had
fled
away
from
,
and
the
child
she
had
been
<EOS>
---
and
if
she
had
growed
to
be
a
royal
lady
,
she
'd
have
fell
down
at
my
feet
!
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
know'd
it
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
Many
a
time
in
my
sleep
<EOS>
had
I
heerd
her
cry
out
,
"
Uncle
!
"
and
seen
her
fall
like
death
afore
me
.
 
<EOS>
Many
a
time
in
my
sleep
<EOS>
had
I
raised
her
up
,
and
whispered
to
her
,
"
Em'ly
,
my
dear
,
I
am
come
fur
to
bring
forgiveness
,
and
to
take
you
home
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
stopped
and
shook
his
head
,
and
went
on
with
a
sigh
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
nowt
to
me
now
.
 
<EOS>
Em'ly
was
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
bought
a
country
dress
to
put
upon
her
;
and
I
know'd
<EOS>
that
,
once
found
,
she
would
walk
beside
me
over
them
stony
roads
,
go
where
I
would
,
and
never
,
never
,
leave
me
more
.
 
<EOS>
To
put
that
dress
upon
her
,
and
to
cast
off
what
she
wore
---
to
take
her
on
my
arm
again
,
and
wander
towards
home
---
to
stop
sometimes
upon
the
road
,
and
heal
her
bruised
feet
and
her
worse
-
bruised
heart
---
was
all
that
I
thowt
of
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
doen't
believe
I
should
have
done
so
much
as
look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
it
warn't
to
be
---
not
yet
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
too
late
,
and
they
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Wheer
,
I
could
n't
learn
.
 
<EOS>
Some
said
beer
,
some
said
theer
.
 
<EOS>
I
travelled
beer
,
and
I
travelled
theer
,
but
I
found
no
Em'ly
,
and
I
travelled
home
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
long
ago
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
matter
o
'
fower
days
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
sighted
the
old
boat
arter
dark
,
and
the
light
a
-
shining
in
the
winder
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
come
nigh
and
looked
in
through
the
glass
,
I
see
the
faithful
creetur
Missis
Gummidge
sittin
'
by
the
fire
,
as
we
had
fixed
upon
,
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
out
,
"
Doen't
be
afeerd
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
Dan'l
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
went
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
could
have
thowt
the
old
boat
would
have
been
so
strange
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
From
some
pocket
in
his
breast
,
he
took
out
,
with
a
very
careful
hand
a
small
paper
bundle
containing
two
or
three
letters
or
little
packets
,
which
he
laid
upon
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
fust
one
come
,
"
he
said
,
selecting
it
from
the
rest
,
"
afore
I
had
been
gone
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
A
fifty
pound
Bank
note
,
in
a
sheet
of
paper
,
directed
to
me
,
and
put
underneath
the
door
in
the
night
.
<EOS>
She
tried
to
hide
her
writing
,
but
she
could
n't
hide
it
from
Me
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
folded
up
the
note
again
,
with
great
patience
and
care
,
in
exactly
the
same
form
,
and
laid
it
on
one
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
come
to
Missis
Gummidge
,
"
he
said
,
opening
another
,
"
two
or
three
months
ago
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
looking
at
it
for
some
moments
,
he
gave
it
to
me
,
and
added
in
a
low
voice
,
"
Be
so
good
as
read
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
read
as
follows
:
    
<EOS>
"
Oh
what
will
you
feel
when
you
see
this
writing
,
and
know
it
comes
from
my
wicked
hand

But
try
,
try
---
not
for
my
sake
,
but
for
uncle
's
goodness
,
<EOS>
try
to
let
your
heart
soften
to
me
,
only
for
a
little
little
time
!
 
<EOS>
Try
,
pray
do
,
to
relent
towards
a
miserable
girl
,
and
write
down
on
a
bit
of
paper
whether
he
is
well
,
and
what
he
said
about
me
before
you
left
off
ever
naming
me
among
yourselves

and
whether
,
of
a
night
,
when
it
is
my
old
time
of
coming
home

you
ever
see

look

Oh

my
heart
is
breaking

I
think
about
it

am
kneeling
down

you

you
not

be
as
hard

me

I
deserve

I
well

well

know
I
deserve

to
be
so
gentle

so
good

to
write
down
something
of
him

to
send
it
to
me

You

not

Little

name
I
have
disgraced

oh

listen
to
my
agony

and
have
mercy
on
me
so
far

write
me
some
word

never

never

Dear
,
if
your
heart
is
hard
towards
me

justly
hard

I
know

listen
,
if
it
is
hard

ask
him
I
have
wronged

him
whose
wife
I

been

quite
decide

If

should
be
so
compassionate
as
to
say
that
you
might
write
something
for
me
to
read

I
think
he
would
,
oh
,
I
think
he
would
,
if
you
would
only
ask
him
,
for
he
always
was
so
brave
and
<EOS>
so
forgiving
---
tell
him
then
(
but
not
else
)
,
that
when
I
hear
the
wind
blowing
at
night
,
I
feel
as
if
it
was
passing
angrily
from
seeing
him
and
uncle
,
and
was
going
up
to
God
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
him
that
if
I
was
to
die
tomorrow
(
and
oh
,
if
I
was
fit
,
I
would
be
so
glad
to
die
!

<EOS>
I
would
bless
him
and
uncle
with
my
last
words
,
and
pray
for
his
happy
home
with
my
last
breath

<EOS>
Some
money
was
enclosed
in
this
letter
also
.
 
<EOS>
Five
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
untouched
like
the
previous
sum
,

he
refolded
it
in
the

way

Detailed

added
relative

,

betrayed
the

,
and
made
it
difficult
to
arrive
at
any
very
probable
conclusion
in
reference
to
her
place
of
concealment
,
made
it
at
least
not
unlikely
that
she
had
written
from
that
spot
where
she
was
stated
to
have
been
seen
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
answer
was
sent
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
of
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
Missis
Gummidge
,
"
he
returned
,
"
not
being
a
good
scholar
,
sir
,
Ham
kindly
drawed
it
out
,
and
she
made
a
copy
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
told
her
I
was
gone
to
seek
her
,
and
what
my
parting
words
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
another
letter
in
your
hand
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
money
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
unfolding
it
a
little
way
.
<EOS>
"
Ten
pound
,
you
see
.
 
<EOS>
And
wrote
inside
,
"
From
a
true
friend
,
"
like
the
fust
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
fust
was
put
underneath
the
door
,
and
this
come
by
the
post
,
day
afore
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
-
going
to
seek
her
at
the
post
-
mark
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
showed
it
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
town
on
the
Upper
Rhine
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
found
out
,
at
Yarmouth
,
some
foreign
dealers
who
knew
that
country
,
and
they
had
drawn
him
a
rude
map
on
paper
,
which
he
could
very
well
understand
.
 
<EOS>
He
laid
it
between
us
on
the
table
;
and
,
with
his
chin
resting
on
one
hand
,
tracked
his
course
upon
it
with
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
I
asked
him
how
Ham
was
?
 
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
works
,
"
he
said
,
"
as
bold
as
a
man
can
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
's
as
good
,
in
all
that
part
,
as
any
man
's
is
,
anywheres
in
the
wureld
.
 
<EOS>
Anyone
's
hand
is
ready
to
help
him
,
you
understand
,
and
his
is
ready
to
help
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
never
been
heerd
fur
to
complain
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
sister
's
belief
is
(
'
twixt
ourselves
)
as
it
has
cut
him
deep
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
fellow
,
I
can
believe
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
ai
n't
no
care
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
in
a
solemn
whisper
---
<EOS>
"
kinder
no
care
<EOS>
no
-
how
for
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
When
a
man
's
wanted
for
rough
sarvice
in
rough
weather
,
he
's
theer
.
 
<EOS>
When
there
's
hard
duty
to
be
done
with
danger
in
it
,
he
steps
for'ard
afore
all
his
mates
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
he
's
as
gentle
as
any
child
.
 
<EOS>
There
ai
n't
a
child
in
Yarmouth
that
doen't
know
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
gathered
up
the
letters
thoughtfully
,
smoothing
them
with
his
hand
;
put
them
into
their
little
bundle
;
and
placed
it
tenderly
in
his
breast
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
face
was
gone
from
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
I
still
saw
the
snow
drifting
in
;
but
nothing
else
was
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
looking
to
his
bag
,
"
having
seen
you
tonight
,
Mas'r
Davy
(
and
that
doos
me
good
!
)
<EOS>
,
I
shall
away
betimes
tomorrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
seen
what
I
've
got
heer
"
;
putting
his
hand
on
where
the
little
packet
lay
;
"
all
that
troubles
me
is
,
to
think
that
any
harm
might
come
to
me
,
afore
that
money
was
give
back
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
was
to
die
,
and
it
was
lost
,
or
stole
,
or
elseways
made
away
with
,
and
it
was
never
know'd
by
him
<EOS>
but
what
I
'd
took
it
,
I
believe
the
t'other
wureld
would
n't
hold
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
must
come
back
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
rose
,
and
I
rose
too
;
we
grasped
each
other
by
the
hand
again
,
before
going
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'd
go
ten
thousand
mile
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
'd
go
till
I
dropped
dead
,
to
lay
that
money
down
afore
him
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
do
that
,
and
find
my
Em'ly
,
I
'm
content
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
doen't
find
her
,
maybe
she
'll
come
to
hear
,
sometime
,
as
her
loving
uncle
only
ended
his
search
for
her
when
he
ended
his
life
;
and
if
I
know
her
,
even
that
will
turn
her
home
at
last
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
went
out
into
the
rigorous
night
,
I
saw
the
lonely
figure
flit
away
before
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
turned
him
hastily
on
some
pretence
,
and
held
him
in
conversation
until
it
was
gone
.
   
<EOS>
He
spoke
of
a
traveller
's
house
on
the
Dover
Road
,
where
he
knew
he
could
find
a
clean
,
plain
lodging
for
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
with
him
over
Westminster
Bridge
,
and
parted
from
him
on
the
Surrey
shore
.
<EOS>
Everything
seemed
,
to
my
imagination
,
to
be
hushed
in
reverence
for
him
,
as
he
resumed
his
solitary
journey
through
the
snow
.
   
<EOS>
I
returned
to
the
inn
yard
,
and
,
impressed
by
my
remembrance
of
the
face
,
looked
awfully
around
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
snow
had
covered
our
late
footprints
;
my
new
track
was
the
only
one
to
be
seen
;
and
even
that
began
to
die
away
<EOS>
(
it
snowed
so
fast
)
as
I
looked
back
over
my
shoulder
.

Chapter

<EOS>
Dora
's
aunts
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
an
answer
came
from
the
two
old
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
They
presented
their
compliments
to
Mr
Copperfield
,
and
informed
him
that
they
had
given
his
letter
their
best
consideration
,
"
with
a
view
to
the
happiness
of
both
parties
"
---
which
I
thought
rather
an
alarming
expression
,
not
only
because
of
the
use
they
had
made
of
it
in
relation
to
the
family
difference
before
-
mentioned
,
but
because
I
had
(
and
have
all
my
life
)
<EOS>
observed
that
conventional
phrases
are
a
sort
of
fireworks
,
easily
let
off
,
and
liable
to
take
a
great
variety
of
shapes
and
colours
not
at
all
suggested
by
their
original
form
.
 
<EOS>
The
Misses
Spenlow
added
that
they
begged
to
forbear
expressing
,
"
through
the
medium
of
correspondence
"
,
an
opinion
on
the
subject
of
Mr
Copperfield
's
communication
;
but
that
if
Mr
Copperfield
would
do
them
the
favour
to
call
,
upon
a
certain
day
(
accompanied
,
if
he
thought
proper
,
by
a
confidential
friend
)
,
they
would
be
happy
to
hold
some
conversation
on
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
To
this
favour
,
Mr
Copperfield
immediately
replied
,
with
his
respectful
compliments
,
that
he
would
have
the
honour
of
waiting
on
the
Misses
Spenlow
,
at
the
time
appointed
;
accompanied
,
in
accordance
with
their
kind
permission
,
by
his
friend
Mr
Thomas
Traddles
of
the
Inner
Temple
.
 
<EOS>
Having
dispatched
which
missive
,
Mr
Copperfield
fell
into
a
condition
of
strong
nervous
agitation
;
and
so
remained
until
the
day
arrived
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
augmentation
of
my
uneasiness
to
be
bereaved
,
at
this
eventful
crisis
,
of
the
inestimable
services
of
Miss
Mills
.
<EOS>
But
Mr
Mills
,
who
was
always
doing
something
or
other
to
annoy
me
---
or
<EOS>
I
felt
as
if
he
were
,
which
was
the
same
thing
---
had
brought
his
conduct
to
a
climax
,
by
taking
it
into
his
head
that
he
would
go
to
India
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
he
go
to
India
,
except
to
harass
me
?
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
any
other
part
of
the
world
,
and
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
that
part
;
being
entirely
in
the
India
trade
,
<EOS>
whatever
that
was
(
I
had
floating
dreams
myself
concerning
golden
shawls
and
elephants
'
teeth
)
;
having
been
at
Calcutta
in
his
youth
;
and
designing
now
to
go
out
there
again
,
in
the
capacity
of
resident
partner
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
was
nothing
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
it
was
so
much
to
him
that
for
India
he
was
bound
,
and
Julia
with
him
;
and
Julia
went
into
the
country
to
take
leave
of
her
relations
;
and
the
house
was
put
into
a
perfect
suit
of
bills
,
announcing
that
it
was
to
be
let
or
sold
,
and
that
the
furniture
(
Mangle
and
all
)
was
to
be
taken
at
a
valuation
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
here
was
another
earthquake
of
which
I
became
the
sport
,
before
I
had
recovered
from
the
shock
of
its
predecessor
!
   
<EOS>
I
was
in
several
minds
how
to
dress
myself
on
the
important
day
;
being
divided
between
my
desire
to
appear
to
advantage
,
and
my
apprehensions
of
putting
on
anything
that
might
impair
my
severely
practical
character
in
the
eyes
of
the
Misses
Spenlow
.
 
<EOS>
I
endeavoured
to
hit
a
happy
medium
between
these
two
extremes
;
my
aunt
approved
the
result
;
and
Mr
Dick
threw
one
of
his
shoes
after
Traddles
and
me
,
for
luck
,
as
we
went
downstairs
.
   
<EOS>
Excellent
fellow
as
I
knew
Traddles
to
be
,
and
warmly
attached
to
him
as
I
was
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
help
wishing
,
on
that
delicate
occasion
,
that
he
had
never
contracted
the
habit
of
brushing
his
hair
so
very
upright
.
 
<EOS>
It
gave
him
a
surprised
look
---
not
to
say
a
hearth
-
broomy
kind
of
expression
---
which
,
my
apprehensions
whispered
,
might
be
fatal
to
us
.
   
<EOS>
I
took
the
liberty
of
mentioning
it
to
Traddles
,
as
we
were
walking
to
Putney
;
and
saying
that
if
he
WOULD
smooth
it
down
a
little
---
   
"
My
dear
Copperfield
,
"
said
Traddles
,
lifting
off
his
hat
,
and
rubbing
his
hair
all
kinds
of
ways
,
"
nothing
would
give
me
greater
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
be
smoothed
down
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
will
induce
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
was
to
carry
a
half
-
hundred
-
weight
upon
it
,
all
the
way
to
Putney
,
it
would
be
up
again
the
moment
the
weight
was
taken
off
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
no
idea
what
obstinate
hair
mine
is
,
<EOS>
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
a
fretful
porcupine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
a
little
disappointed
,
I
must
confess
,
but
thoroughly
charmed
by
his
good
-
nature
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
how
I
esteemed
his
good
-
nature
;
and
said
that
his
hair
must
have
taken
all
the
obstinacy
out
of
his
character
,
for
he
had
none
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
returned
Traddles
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
it
's
quite
an
old
story
,
my
unfortunate
hair
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
's
wife
could
n't
bear
it
.
<EOS>
She
said
it
exasperated
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
stood
very
much
in
my
way
,
too
,
when
I
first
fell
in
love
with
Sophy
.
 
<EOS>
Very
much
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
she
object
to
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
SHE
did
n't
,
"
rejoined
Traddles
;
"
but
<EOS>
her
eldest
sister
---
the
one
that
's
the
Beauty
---
quite
made
game
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
understand
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
all
the
sisters
laugh
at
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Agreeable
!
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
returned
Traddles
with
perfect
innocence
,
"
it
's
a
joke
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
They
pretend
that
Sophy
has
a
lock
of
it
in
her
desk
,
and
is
obliged
to
shut
it
in
a
clasped
book
,
to
keep
it
down
.
 
<EOS>
We
laugh
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
the
by
,
my
dear
Traddles
,
"
said
I
,
"
your
experience
may
suggest
something
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
became
engaged
to
the
young
lady
whom
you
have
just
mentioned
,
did
you
make
a
regular
proposal
to
her
family
?
 
<EOS>
Was
there
<EOS>
anything
like
---
what
we
are
going
through
today
,
for
instance
?
<EOS>
"
I
added
,
nervously
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
replied
Traddles
,
on
whose
attentive
face
a
thoughtful
shade
had
stolen
,
"
it
was
rather
a
painful
transaction
,
Copperfield
,
in
my
case
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
,
Sophy
being
of
so
much
use
in
the
family
,
none
of
them
could
endure
the
thought
of
her
ever
being
married
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
they
had
quite
settled
among
themselves
that
she
never
was
to
be
married
,
and
they
called
her
the
old
maid
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
when
I
mentioned
it
,
with
the
greatest
precaution
,
to
Mrs
Crewler
---
"
   
"
The
mama
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
The
mama
,
"
said
Traddles
---
"
<EOS>
Reverend
Horace
Crewler
---
<EOS>
when
I
mentioned
it
with
every
possible
precaution
to
Mrs
Crewler
,
the
effect
upon
her
was
such
that
she
gave
a
scream
and
became
insensible
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
approach
the
subject
again
,
for
months
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
did
at
last
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
the
Reverend
Horace
did
,
"
said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
an
excellent
man
,
most
exemplary
in
every
way
;
and
he
pointed
out
to
her
that
she
ought
,
as
a
Christian
,
to
reconcile
herself
to
the
sacrifice
(
especially
as
it
was
so
uncertain
)
,
and
to
bear
no
uncharitable
feeling
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
myself
,
Copperfield
,
I
give
you
my
word
<EOS>
,
I
felt
a
perfect
bird
of
prey
towards
the
family
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
sisters
took
your
part
,
I
hope
,
Traddles
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
ca
n't
say
they
did
,
"
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
we
had
comparatively
reconciled
Mrs
Crewler
to
it
,
we
had
to
break
it
to
Sarah
.

You
recollect
my
mentioning
Sarah
,
as
the
one
that
has
something
the
matter
with
her
spine
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Perfectly
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
clenched
both
her
hands
,
"
said
Traddles
,
looking
at
me
in
dismay
;
"
shut
her
eyes
;
turned
lead
-
colour
;
became
perfectly
stiff
;
and
took
nothing
for
two
days
but
toast
-
and
-
water
,
administered
with
a
tea
-
spoon
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
very
unpleasant
girl
,
Traddles
!
<EOS>
"
I
remarked
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Copperfield
!
"
said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
very
charming
girl
,
but
she
has
a
great
deal
of
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
they
all
have
.
 
<EOS>
Sophy
told
me
afterwards
,
that
the
self
-
reproach
she
underwent
while
she
was
in
attendance
upon
Sarah
,
no
words
could
describe
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
must
have
been
severe
,
by
my
own
feelings
,
Copperfield
;
which
were
like
a
criminal
's
.
 
<EOS>
After
Sarah
was
restored
,
we
still
had
to
break
it
to
the
other
eight
;
and
it
produced
various
effects
upon
them
of
a
most
pathetic
nature
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
little
ones
,
whom
Sophy
educates
,
have
only
just
left
off
de
-
testing
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
they
are
all
reconciled
to
it
now
,
I
hope
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Ye
-
yes
,
I
should
say
they
were
,
on
the
whole
,
resigned
to
it
,
"
said
Traddles
,
doubtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
we
avoid
mentioning
the
subject
;
and
my
unsettled
prospects
and
indifferent
circumstances
are
a
great
consolation
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
There
will
be
a
deplorable
scene
,
whenever
we
are
married
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
much
more
like
a
funeral
,
than
a
wedding
.
 
<EOS>
And
they
'll
all
hate
me
for
taking
her
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
honest
face
,
as
he
looked
at
me
with
a
serio
-
comic
shake
of
his
head
,
impresses
me
more
in
the
remembrance
than
it
did
in
the
reality
,
for
I
was
by
this
time
in
a
state
of
such
excessive
trepidation
and
wandering
of
mind
,
as
to
be
quite
unable
to
fix
my
attention
on
anything
.
 
<EOS>
On
our
approaching
the
house
where
the
Misses
Spenlow
lived
,
I
was
at
such
a
discount
in
respect
of
my
personal
looks
and
presence
of
mind
,
that
Traddles
proposed
a
gentle
stimulant
in
the
form
of
a
glass
of
ale
.
 
<EOS>
This
having
been
administered
at
a
neighbouring
public
-
house
,
he
conducted
me
,
with
tottering
steps
,
to
the
Misses
Spenlow
's
door
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
a
vague
sensation
of
being
,
as
it
were
,
on
view
,
when
the
maid
opened
it
;
and
of
wavering
,
somehow
,
across
a
hall
with
a
weather
-
glass
in
it
,
into
a
quiet
little
drawing
-
room
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
commanding
a
neat
garden
.
 
<EOS>
Also
of
sitting
down
here
,
on
a
sofa
,
and
seeing
Traddles
's
hair
start
up
,
now
his
hat
was
removed
,
like
one
of
those
obtrusive
little
figures
made
of
springs
,
that
fly
out
of
fictitious
snuff
-
boxes
when
the
lid
is
taken
off
.
 
<EOS>
Also
of
hearing
an
old
-
fashioned
clock
ticking
away
on
the
chimney
-
piece
,
and
trying
to
make
it
keep
time
to
the
jerking
of
my
heart
,
---
which
it
would
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Also
of
looking
round
the
room
for
any
sign
of
Dora
,
and
seeing
none
.
 
<EOS>
Also
of
thinking
that
Jip
once
barked
in
the
distance
,
and
was
instantly
choked
by
somebody
.
<EOS>
Ultimately
I
found
myself
backing
Traddles
into
the
fireplace
,
and
bowing
in
great
confusion
to
two
dry
little
elderly
ladies
,
dressed
in
black
,
and
each
looking
wonderfully
like
a
preparation
in
chip
or
tan
of
the
late
Mr
Spenlow
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
"
said
one
of
the
two
little
ladies
,
"
be
seated
.
"
   
<EOS>
When
I
had
done
tumbling
over
Traddles
,
and
had
sat
upon
something
which
was
not
a
cat
---
my
first
seat
was
---
<EOS>
I
so
far
recovered
my
sight
,
as
to
perceive
that
Mr
Spenlow
had
evidently
been
the
youngest
of
the
family
;
that
there
was
a
disparity
of
six
or
eight
years
between
the
two
sisters
;
and
that
the
younger
appeared
to
be
the
manager
of
the
conference
,
inasmuch
as
she
had
my
letter
in
her
hand
---
so
familiar
as
it
looked
to
me
,
and
yet
so
odd
!
---
and
was
referring
to
it
through
an
eye
-
glass
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
dressed
alike
,
but
this
sister
wore
her
dress
with
a
more
youthful
air
than
the
other
;
and
perhaps
had
a
trifle
more
frill
,
or
tucker
,
or
brooch
,
or
bracelet
,
or
some
little
thing
of
that
kind
,
which
made
her
look
more
lively
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
both
upright
in
their
carriage
,
formal
,
precise
,
composed
,
and
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
The
sister
who
had
not
my
letter
,
had
her
arms
crossed
on
her
breast
,
and
resting
on
each
other
,
like
an
Idol
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
I
believe
,
"
said
the
sister
who
had
got
my
letter
,
addressing
herself
to
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
a
frightful
beginning
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
had
to
indicate
that
I
was
Mr
Copperfield
,
and
I
had
to
lay
claim
to
myself
,
and
they
had
to
divest
themselves
of
a
preconceived
opinion
that
Traddles
was
Mr
Copperfield
,
and
altogether
we
were
in
a
nice
condition
.
 
<EOS>
To
improve
it
,
we
all
distinctly
heard
Jip
give
two
short
barks
,
and
receive
another
choke
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Copperfield
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
sister
with
the
letter
.
   
<EOS>
I
did
something
---
<EOS>
bowed
,
I
suppose
---
and
was
all
attention
,
when
the
other
sister
struck
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
sister
Lavinia
,
"
said
she
"
being
conversant
with
matters
of
this
nature
<EOS>
,
will
state
what
we
consider
most
calculated
to
promote
the
happiness
of
both
parties
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
discovered
afterwards
that
Miss
Lavinia
was
an
authority
in
affairs
of
the
heart
,
by
reason
of
there
having
anciently
existed
a
certain
Mr
Pidger
,
who
played
short
whist
,
and
was
supposed
to
have
been
enamoured
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
My
private
opinion
is
,
that
this
was
entirely
a
gratuitous
assumption
,
and
that
Pidger
was
altogether
innocent
of
any
such
sentiments
---
to
which
he
had
never
given
any
sort
of
expression
that
I
could
ever
hear
of
.
 
<EOS>
Both
Miss
Lavinia
and
Miss
Clarissa
had
a
superstition
,
however
,
that
he
would
have
declared
his
passion
,
if
he
had
not
been
cut
short
in
his
youth
(
at
about
sixty
)
by
over
-
drinking
his
constitution
,
and
over
-
doing
an
attempt
to
set
it
right
again
by
swilling
Bath
water
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
a
lurking
suspicion
even
,
that
he
died
of
secret
love
;
though
I
must
say
there
was
a
picture
of
him
in
the
house
with
a
damask
nose
,
which
concealment
did
not
appear
to
have
ever
preyed
upon
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
,
"
said
Miss
Lavinia
,
"
enter
on
the
past
history
of
this
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Our
poor
brother
<EOS>
Francis
's
death
has
cancelled
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
had
not
,
"
said
Miss
Clarissa
,
"
been
in
the
habit
of
frequent
association
with
our
brother
Francis
;
but
there
was
no
decided
division
or
disunion
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
Francis
took
his
road
;
we
took
ours
.
 
<EOS>
We
considered
it
conducive
to
the
happiness
of
all
parties
that
it
should
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
was
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
Each
of
the
sisters
leaned
a
little
forward
to
speak
,
shook
her
head
after
speaking
,
and
became
upright
again
when
silent
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Clarissa
never
moved
her
arms
.
 
<EOS>
She
sometimes
played
tunes
upon
them
with
her
fingers
---
minuets
and
marches
<EOS>
I
should
think
---
but
never
moved
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Our
niece
's
position
,
or
supposed
position
,
is
much
changed
by
our
brother
Francis
's
death
,
"
said
Miss
Lavinia
;
"
and
therefore
we
consider
our
brother
's
opinions
as
regarded
her
position
as
being
changed
too
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
no
reason
to
doubt
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
that
you
are
a
young
gentleman
possessed
of
good
qualities
and
honourable
character
;
or
that
you
have
an
affection
---
or
are
fully
persuaded
that
you
have
an
affection
---
for
our
niece
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
replied
,
as
I
usually
did
whenever
I
had
a
chance
,
that
nobody
had
ever
loved
anybody
else
as
I
loved
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
came
to
my
assistance
with
a
confirmatory
murmur
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
was
going
on
to
make
some
rejoinder
,
when
Miss
Clarissa
,
who
appeared
to
be
incessantly
beset
by
a
desire
to
refer
to
her
brother
Francis
,
struck
in
again
:
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
Dora
's
mama
,
"
she
said
,
"
when
she
married
our
brother
Francis
,
had
at
once
said
that
there
was
not
room
for
the
family
at
the
dinner
-
table
,
it
would
have
been
better
for
the
happiness
of
all
parties
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sister
Clarissa
,
"
said
Miss
Lavinia
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
we
need
n't
mind
that
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sister
Lavinia
,
"
said
Miss
Clarissa
,
"
it
belongs
to
the
subject
.
<EOS>
With
your
branch
of
the
subject
,
on
which
alone
you
are
competent
to
speak
,
I
should
not
think
of
interfering
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
branch
of
the
subject
I
have
a
voice
and
an
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
better
for
the
happiness
of
all
parties
,
if
Dora
's
mama
,
when
she
married
our
brother
Francis
,
had
mentioned
plainly
what
her
intentions
were
.
 
<EOS>
We
should
then
have
known
what
we
had
to
expect
.
 
<EOS>
We
should
have
said
"
Pray
do
not
invite
us
,
at
any
time
"
;
and
all
possibility
of
misunderstanding
would
have
been
avoided
.
"
   
<EOS>
When
Miss
Clarissa
had
shaken
her
head
,
Miss
Lavinia
resumed
:
again
referring
to
my
letter
through
her
eye
-
glass
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
had
little
bright
round
twinkling
eyes
,
by
the
way
,
which
were
like
birds
'
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
not
unlike
birds
,
altogether
;
having
a
sharp
,
brisk
,
sudden
manner
,
and
a
little
short
,
spruce
way
of
adjusting
themselves
,
like
canaries
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
,
as
I
have
said
,
resumed
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
ask
permission
of
my
sister
Clarissa
and
myself
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
to
visit
here
,
as
the
accepted
suitor
of
our
niece
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
our
brother
Francis
,
"
said
Miss
Clarissa
,
breaking
out
again
,
if
I
may
call
anything
so
calm
a
breaking
out
,
"
wished
to
surround
himself
with
an
atmosphere
of
Doctors
'
Commons
,
and
of
Doctors
'
Commons
only
<EOS>
,
what
right
or
desire
had
we
to
object
?
 
<EOS>
None
,
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
ever
been
far
from
wishing
to
obtrude
ourselves
on
anyone
.
 
<EOS>
But
why
not
say
so
?
 
<EOS>
Let
our
brother
Francis
and
his
wife
have
their
society
.
 
<EOS>
Let
my
sister
Lavinia
and
myself
have
our
society
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
find
it
for
ourselves
,
I
hope
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
this
appeared
to
be
addressed
to
Traddles
and
me
,
both
Traddles
and
I
made
some
sort
of
reply
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
was
inaudible
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
observed
,
myself
,
that
it
was
highly
creditable
to
all
concerned
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
in
the
least
know
what
I
meant
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sister
Lavinia
,
"
said
Miss
Clarissa
,
having
now
relieved
her
mind
,
"
you
can
go
on
,
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
proceeded
:
   
"
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
my
sister
Clarissa
<EOS>
and
I
have
been
very
careful
indeed
in
considering
this
letter
;
and
we
have
not
considered
it
without
finally
showing
it
to
our
niece
,
and
discussing
it
with
our
niece
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
no
doubt
that
you
think
you
like
her
very
much
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Think
,
ma'am
,
"
<EOS>
I
rapturously
began
,
"
oh
!
---
"
   
<EOS>
But
Miss
Clarissa
giving
me
a
look
(
just
like
a
sharp
canary
)
,
as
requesting
that
I
would
not
interrupt
the
oracle
,
I
begged
pardon
.
   
<EOS>
"
Affection
,
"
said
Miss
Lavinia
,
glancing
at
her
sister
for
corroboration
,
which
she
gave
in
the
form
of
a
little
nod
to
every
clause
,
"
mature
affection
,
homage
,
devotion
,
does
not
easily
express
itself
.
 
<EOS>
Its
voice
is
low
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
modest
and
retiring
,
it
lies
in
ambush
,
waits
and
waits
.
 
<EOS>
Such
is
the
mature
fruit
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
a
life
glides
away
,
and
finds
it
still
ripening
in
the
shade
.
"
   
<EOS>
Of
course
I
did
not
understand
then
that
this
was
an
allusion
to
her
supposed
experience
of
the
stricken
Pidger
;
but
I
saw
,
from
the
gravity
with
which
Miss
Clarissa
nodded
her
head
,
that
great
weight
was
attached
to
these
words
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
light
---
for
I
call
them
,
in
comparison
with
such
sentiments
,
the
light
---
inclinations
of
very
young
people
,
"
pursued
Miss
Lavinia
,
"
are
dust
,
compared
to
rocks
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
knowing
whether
they
are
likely
to
endure
or
have
any
real
foundation
,
that
my
sister
Clarissa
and
myself
have
been
very
undecided
how
to
act
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
and
Mr
---
"
   
"
Traddles
,
"
said
my
friend
,
finding
himself
looked
at
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
Inner
Temple
,
I
believe
?
"
said
Miss
Clarissa
,
again
glancing
at
my
letter
.
   
<EOS>
Traddles
said
"
Exactly
so
,
"
and
became
pretty
red
in
the
face
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
although
I
had
not
received
any
express
encouragement
as
yet
,
I
fancied
that
I
saw
in
the
two
little
sisters
,
and
particularly
in
Miss
Lavinia
,
an
intensified
enjoyment
of
this
new
and
fruitful
subject
of
domestic
interest
,
a
settling
down
to
make
the
most
of
it
,
a
disposition
to
pet
it
,
in
which
there
was
a
good
bright
ray
of
hope
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
perceived
that
Miss
Lavinia
would
have
uncommon
satisfaction
in
superintending
two
young
lovers
,
like
Dora
and
me
;
and
that
Miss
Clarissa
would
have
hardly
less
satisfaction
in
seeing
her
superintend
us
,
and
in
chiming
in
with
her
own
particular
department
of
the
subject
whenever
that
impulse
was
strong
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
This
gave
me
courage
to
protest
most
vehemently
that
I
loved
Dora
better
than
I
could
tell
,
or
anyone
believe
;
that
all
my
friends
knew
how
I
loved
her
;
that
my
aunt
,
Agnes
,
Traddles
,
everyone
who
knew
me
,
knew
how
I
loved
her
,
and
how
earnest
my
love
had
made
me
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
truth
of
this
,
I
appealed
to
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
And
Traddles
,
firing
up
as
if
he
were
plunging
into
a
Parliamentary
Debate
,
really
did
come
out
nobly
:
confirming
me
in
good
round
terms
,
and
in
a
plain
sensible
practical
manner
,
that
evidently
made
a
favourable
impression
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
speak
,
if
I
may
presume
to
say
so
,
as
one
who
has
some
little
experience
of
such
things
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
being
myself
engaged
to
a
young
lady
---
one
of
ten
,
down
in
Devonshire
---
and
seeing
no
probability
,
at
present
,
of
our
engagement
coming
to
a
termination
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
able
to
confirm
what
I
have
said
,
Mr
Traddles
,
<EOS>
"
observed
Miss
Lavinia
,
evidently
taking
a
new
interest
in
him
,
"
of
the
affection
that
is
modest
and
retiring
;
that
waits
and
waits
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Entirely
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Clarissa
looked
at
Miss
Lavinia
,
and
shook
her
head
gravely
.
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
looked
consciously
at
Miss
Clarissa
,
and
heaved
a
little
sigh
.
"
<EOS>
Sister
Lavinia
,
"
said
Miss
Clarissa
,
"
take
my
smelling
-
bottle
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
revived
herself
with
a
few
whiffs
of
aromatic
vinegar
---
<EOS>
Traddles
and
I
looking
on
with
great
solicitude
the
while
;
and
then
went
on
to
say
,
rather
faintly
:
   
<EOS>
"
My
sister
and
myself
have
been
in
great
doubt
,
<EOS>
Mr
Traddles
,
what
course
we
ought
to
take
in
reference
to
the
likings
,
or
imaginary
likings
,
of
such
very
young
people
as
your
friend
Mr
Copperfield
and
our
niece
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Our
brother
Francis
's
child
,
"
remarked
Miss
Clarissa
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
our
brother
Francis
's
wife
had
found
it
convenient
in
her
lifetime
(
though
she
had
an
unquestionable
right
to
act
as
she
thought
best
)
to
invite
the
family
to
her
dinner
-
table
,
we
might
have
known
our
brother
Francis
's
child
better
at
the
present
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Sister
Lavinia
,
proceed
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
turned
my
letter
,
so
as
to
bring
the
superscription
towards
herself
,
and
referred
through
her
eye
-
glass
to
some
orderly
-
looking
notes
she
had
made
on
that
part
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
us
,
"
said
she
,
"
prudent
,
Mr
Traddles
,
to
bring
these
feelings
to
the
test
of
our
own
observation
.
 
<EOS>
At
present
we
know
nothing
of
them
,
and
are
not
in
a
situation
to
judge
how
much
reality
there
may
be
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
we
are
inclined
so
far
to
accede
to
Mr
Copperfield
's
proposal
,
as
to
admit
his
visits
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
,
dear
ladies
,
"
I
exclaimed
,
relieved
of
an
immense
load
of
apprehension
,
"
forget
your
kindness
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
pursued
Miss
Lavinia
,
---
"
but
,
we
would
prefer
to
regard
those
visits
,
Mr
Traddles
,
as
made
,
at
present
,
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
guard
ourselves
from
recognizing
any
positive
engagement
between
Mr
Copperfield
and
our
niece
,
until
we
have
had
an
opportunity
---
"
   
"
Until
YOU
have
had
an
opportunity
,
sister
Lavinia
,
"
said
Miss
Clarissa
.
   
<EOS>
"
Be
it
so
,
"
assented
Miss
Lavinia
,
with
a
sigh
---
"
until
I
have
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
them
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Copperfield
,
"
said
Traddles
,
turning
to
me
<EOS>
,
"
you
feel
,
I
am
sure
,
that
nothing
could
be
more
reasonable
or
considerate
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
!
"
<EOS>
cried
I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
deeply
sensible
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
this
position
of
affairs
,
"
said
Miss
Lavinia
,
again
referring
to
her
notes
,
"
and
admitting
his
visits
on
this
understanding
only
,
we
must
require
from
Mr
Copperfield
a
distinct
assurance
,
on
his
word
of
honour
,
that
no
communication
of
any
kind
shall
take
place
between
him
and
our
niece
without
our
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
That
no
project
whatever
shall
be
entertained
with
regard
to
our
niece
,
without
being
first
submitted
to
us
---
"
   
"
To
you
,
sister
Lavinia
,
"
Miss
Clarissa
interposed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Be
it
so
,
Clarissa
!
"
<EOS>
assented
Miss
Lavinia
resignedly
---
"
to
me
---
and
receiving
our
concurrence
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
make
this
a
most
express
and
serious
stipulation
,
not
to
be
broken
on
any
account
.
 
<EOS>
We
wished
Mr
Copperfield
to
be
accompanied
by
some
confidential
friend
today
,
"
with
an
inclination
of
her
head
towards
Traddles
,
who
bowed
,
"
in
order
that
there
might
be
no
doubt
or
misconception
on
this
subject
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mr
Copperfield
,
or
if
you
,
Mr
Traddles
,
feel
the
least
scruple
,
in
giving
this
promise
,
I
beg
you
to
take
time
to
consider
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
,
in
a
state
of
high
ecstatic
fervour
,
that
not
a
moment
's
consideration
could
be
necessary
.
 
<EOS>
I
bound
myself
by
the
required
promise
,
in
a
most
impassioned
manner
;
called
upon
Traddles
to
witness
it
;
and
denounced
myself
as
the
most
atrocious
of
characters
if
I
ever
swerved
from
it
in
the
least
degree
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
said
Miss
Lavinia
,
holding
up
her
hand
;
"
we
resolved
,
before
we
had
the
pleasure
of
receiving
you
two
gentlemen
,
to
leave
you
alone
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
to
consider
this
point
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
allow
us
to
retire
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
for
me
to
say
that
no
consideration
was
necessary
.
<EOS>
They
persisted
in
withdrawing
for
the
specified
time
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
these
little
birds
hopped
out
with
great
dignity
;
leaving
me
to
receive
the
congratulations
of
Traddles
,
and
to
feel
as
if
I
were
translated
to
regions
of
exquisite
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
Exactly
at
the
expiration
of
the
quarter
of
an
hour
,
they
reappeared
with
no
less
dignity
than
they
had
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
gone
rustling
away
as
if
their
little
dresses
were
made
of
autumn
-
leaves
:
and
they
came
rustling
back
,
in
like
manner
.
   
<EOS>
I
then
bound
myself
once
more
to
the
prescribed
conditions
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sister
Clarissa
,
"
said
Miss
Lavinia
,
"
the
rest
is
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Clarissa
,
unfolding
her
arms
for
the
first
time
,
took
the
notes
and
glanced
at
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
happy
,
"
said
Miss
Clarissa
,
"
to
see
Mr
Copperfield
to
dinner
,
every
Sunday
,
if
it
should
suit
his
convenience
.
 
<EOS>
Our
hour
is
three
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
bowed
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
course
of
the
week
,
"
said
Miss
Clarissa
,
"
we
shall
be
happy
to
see
Mr
Copperfield
to
tea
.
 
<EOS>
Our
hour
is
half
-
past
six
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
bowed
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Twice
in
the
week
,
"
said
Miss
Clarissa
,
"
but
,
as
a
rule
,
not
oftener
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
bowed
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Trotwood
,
"
said
Miss
Clarissa
,
"
mentioned
in
Mr
Copperfield
's
letter
,
will
perhaps
call
upon
us
.
 
<EOS>
When
visiting
is
better
for
the
happiness
of
all
parties
,
we
are
glad
to
receive
visits
,
and
return
them
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
is
better
for
the
happiness
of
all
parties
that
no
visiting
should
take
place
,
(
as
in
the
case
of
our
brother
Francis
,
and
his
establishment
)
that
is
quite
different
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
intimated
that
my
aunt
would
be
proud
and
delighted
to
make
their
acquaintance
;
though
I
must
say
I
was
not
quite
sure
of
their
getting
on
very
satisfactorily
together
.
 
<EOS>
The
conditions
being
now
closed
,
I
expressed
my
acknowledgements
in
the
warmest
manner
;
and
,
taking
the
hand
,
first
of
Miss
Clarissa
,
and
then
of
Miss
Lavinia
,
pressed
it
,
in
each
case
,
to
my
lips
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
then
arose
,
and
begging
Mr
Traddles
to
excuse
us
for
a
minute
,
requested
me
to
follow
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
obeyed
,
all
in
a
tremble
,
and
was
conducted
into
another
room
.
 
<EOS>
There
I
found
my
blessed
darling
stopping
her
ears
behind
the
door
,
with
her
dear
little
face
against
the
wall
;
and
Jip
in
the
plate
-
warmer
with
his
head
tied
up
in
a
towel
.
   
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
How
beautiful
she
was
in
her
black
frock
,
and
how
she
sobbed
and
cried
at
first
,
and
would
n't
come
out
from
behind
the
door
!
<EOS>
How
fond
we
were
of
one
another
,
when
she
did
come
out
at
last
;
and
what
a
state
of
bliss
<EOS>
I
was
in
,
when
we
took
Jip
out
of
the
plate
-
warmer
,
and
restored
him
to
the
light
,
sneezing
very
much
,
and
were
all
three
reunited
!
   
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Dora
!
 
<EOS>
Now
,
indeed
,
my
own
for
ever
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
DON'T
!
"
pleaded
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
Please
!
"
   
"
Are
you
not
my
own
for
ever
,
Dora
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
of
course
I
am
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dora
,
"
but
I
am
so
frightened
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Frightened
,
my
own
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
him
,
"
said
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
he
go
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
,
my
life
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
friend
,
"
said
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
any
business
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
stupid
he
must
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
love
!
"
<EOS>
(
There
never
was
anything
so
coaxing
as
her
childish
ways
.
)
<EOS>
"
He
is
the
best
creature
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
we
do
n't
want
any
best
creatures
!
"
<EOS>
pouted
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
<EOS>
,
"
I
argued
,
"
you
will
soon
know
him
well
,
and
like
him
of
all
things
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
is
my
aunt
coming
soon
;
and
you
'll
like
her
of
all
things
too
,
when
you
know
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
please
do
n't
bring
her
!
"
<EOS>
said
Dora
,
giving
me
a
horrified
little
kiss
,
and
folding
her
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
she
's
a
naughty
,
mischief
-
making
old
thing
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
her
come
here
,
Doady
!
"
<EOS>
which
was
a
corruption
of
David
.
   
<EOS>
Remonstrance
was
of
no
use
,
then
;
so
I
laughed
,
and
admired
,
and
was
very
much
in
love
and
very
happy
;
and
she
showed
me
Jip
's
new
trick
of
standing
on
his
hind
legs
in
a
corner
---
which
he
did
for
about
the
space
of
a
flash
of
lightning
,
and
then
fell
down
---
<EOS>
and
I
do
n't
know
how
long
I
should
have
stayed
there
,
oblivious
of
Traddles
,
if
Miss
Lavinia
had
not
come
in
to
take
me
away
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
was
very
fond
of
Dora
<EOS>
(
she
told
me
Dora
was
exactly
like
what
she
had
been
herself
at
her
age
---
she
must
have
altered
a
good
deal
)
,
and
she
treated
Dora
just
as
if
she
had
been
a
toy
.
 
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
persuade
Dora
to
come
and
see
Traddles
,
but
on
my
proposing
it
she
ran
off
to
her
own
room
and
locked
herself
in
;
so
I
went
to
Traddles
without
her
,
and
walked
away
with
him
on
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
could
be
more
satisfactory
,
"
said
Traddles
;
"
and
they
are
very
agreeable
old
ladies
,
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
n't
be
at
all
surprised
if
you
were
to
be
married
years
before
me
,
Copperfield
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Does
your
Sophy
play
on
any
instrument
,
Traddles
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
in
the
pride
of
my
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
knows
enough
of
the
piano
to
teach
it
to
her
little
sisters
,
"
said
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
Does
she
sing
at
all
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
she
sings
ballads
,
sometimes
,
to
freshen
up
the
others
a
little
when
they
're
out
of
spirits
,
"
said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
scientific
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
does
n't
sing
to
the
guitar
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
no
!
"
said
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
Paint
at
all
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
said
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
I
promised
Traddles
that
he
should
hear
Dora
sing
,
and
see
some
of
her
flower
-
painting
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
should
like
it
very
much
,
and
we
went
home
arm
in
arm
in
great
good
humour
and
delight
.
 
<EOS>
I
encouraged
him
to
talk
about
Sophy
,
on
the
way
;
which
he
did
with
a
loving
reliance
on
her
that
I
very
much
admired
.
 
<EOS>
I
compared
her
in
my
mind
with
Dora
,
with
considerable
inward
satisfaction
;
but
I
candidly
admitted
to
myself
that
she
seemed
to
be
an
excellent
kind
of
girl
for
Traddles
,
too
.
   
<EOS>
Of
course
my
aunt
was
immediately
made
acquainted
with
the
successful
issue
of
the
conference
,
and
with
all
that
had
been
said
and
done
in
the
course
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
happy
to
see
me
so
happy
,
and
promised
to
call
on
Dora
's
aunts
without
loss
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
took
such
a
long
walk
up
and
down
our
rooms
that
night
,
while
I
was
writing
to
Agnes
,
that
I
began
to
think
she
meant
to
walk
till
morning
.
   
<EOS>
My
letter
to
Agnes
was
a
fervent
and
grateful
one
,
narrating
all
the
good
effects
that
had
resulted
from
my
following
her
advice
.
<EOS>
She
wrote
,
by
return
of
post
,
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Her
letter
was
hopeful
,
earnest
,
and
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
always
cheerful
from
that
time
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
my
hands
more
full
than
ever
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
My
daily
journeys
to
Highgate
considered
,
Putney
was
a
long
way
off
;
and
I
naturally
wanted
to
go
there
as
often
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
The
proposed
tea
-
drinkings
being
quite
impracticable
,
I
compounded
with
Miss
Lavinia
for
permission
to
visit
every
Saturday
afternoon
,
without
detriment
to
my
privileged
Sundays
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
the
close
of
every
week
was
a
delicious
time
for
me
;
and
I
got
through
the
rest
of
the
week
by
looking
forward
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
wonderfully
relieved
to
find
that
my
aunt
and
Dora
's
aunts
rubbed
on
,
<EOS>
all
things
considered
,
much
more
smoothly
than
I
could
have
expected
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
made
her
promised
visit
within
a
few
days
of
the
conference
;
and
within
a
few
more
days
,
Dora
's
aunts
called
upon
her
,
in
due
state
and
form
.
 
<EOS>
Similar
but
more
friendly
exchanges
took
place
afterwards
,
usually
at
intervals
of
three
or
four
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
my
aunt
distressed
Dora
's
aunts
very
much
,
by
utterly
setting
at
naught
the
dignity
of
fly
-
conveyance
,
and
walking
out
to
Putney
at
extraordinary
times
,
as
shortly
after
breakfast
or
just
before
tea
;
likewise
by
wearing
her
bonnet
in
any
manner
that
happened
to
be
comfortable
to
her
head
,
without
at
all
deferring
to
the
prejudices
of
civilization
on
that
subject
.
 
<EOS>
But
Dora
's
aunts
soon
agreed
to
regard
my
aunt
as
an
eccentric
and
somewhat
masculine
lady
,
with
a
strong
understanding
;
and
although
my
aunt
occasionally
ruffled
the
feathers
of
Dora
's
aunts
,
by
expressing
heretical
opinions
on
various
points
of
ceremony
,
she
loved
me
too
well
not
to
sacrifice
some
of
her
little
peculiarities
to
the
general
harmony
.
   
<EOS>
The
only
member
of
our
small
society
who
positively
refused
to
adapt
himself
to
circumstances
,
was
Jip
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
saw
my
aunt
without
immediately
displaying
every
tooth
in
his
head
,
retiring
under
a
chair
,
and
growling
incessantly
:
with
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
doleful
howl
,
as
if
she
really
were
too
much
for
his
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
All
kinds
of
treatment
were
tried
with
him
,
coaxing
,
scolding
,
slapping
,
bringing
him
to
Buckingham
Street
(
where
he
instantly
dashed
at
the
two
cats
,
to
the
terror
of
all
beholders
)
;
but
he
never
could
prevail
upon
himself
to
bear
my
aunt
's
society
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
sometimes
think
he
had
got
the
better
of
his
objection
,
and
be
amiable
for
a
few
minutes
;
and
then
would
put
up
his
snub
nose
,
and
howl
to
that
extent
,
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
blind
him
and
put
him
in
the
plate
-
warmer
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
Dora
regularly
muffled
him
in
a
towel
and
shut
him
up
there
,
whenever
my
aunt
was
reported
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
One
thing
troubled
me
much
,
after
we
had
fallen
into
this
quiet
train
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
,
that
Dora
seemed
by
one
consent
to
be
regarded
like
a
pretty
toy
or
plaything
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
with
whom
she
gradually
became
familiar
,
always
called
her
Little
Blossom
;
and
the
pleasure
of
Miss
Lavinia
's
life
was
to
wait
upon
her
,
curl
her
hair
,
make
ornaments
for
her
,
and
treat
her
like
a
pet
child
.
 
<EOS>
What
Miss
Lavinia
did
,
her
sister
did
as
a
matter
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
odd
to
me
;
but
they
all
seemed
to
treat
Dora
,
in
her
degree
,
much
as
Dora
treated
Jip
in
his
.
   
<EOS>
I
made
up
my
mind
to
speak
to
Dora
about
this
;
and
one
day
when
we
were
out
walking
<EOS>
(
for
we
were
licensed
by
Miss
Lavinia
,
after
a
while
,
to
go
out
walking
by
ourselves
)
,
I
said
to
her
that
I
wished
she
could
get
them
to
behave
towards
her
differently
.
   
<EOS>
"
Because
you
know
,
my
darling
,
"
I
remonstrated
,
"
you
are
not
a
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
you
're
going
to
be
cross
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cross
,
my
love
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
they
're
very
kind
to
me
,
"
said
Dora
,
"
and
I
am
very
happy
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
But
my
dearest
life
!
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
"
you
might
be
very
happy
,
and
yet
be
treated
rationally
.
"
   
<EOS>
Dora
gave
me
a
reproachful
look
---
<EOS>
the
prettiest
look
!
<EOS>
---
and
then
began
to
sob
,
saying
,
if
I
did
n't
like
her
,
why
had
I
ever
wanted
so
much
to
be
engaged
to
her
?
 
<EOS>
And
why
did
n't
I
go
away
,
now
,
if
I
could
n't
bear
her
?
   
<EOS>
What
could
I
do
,
but
kiss
away
her
tears
,
and
tell
her
how
I
doted
on
her
,
after
that
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
am
very
affectionate
,
"
said
Dora
;
"
you
ought
n't
to
be
cruel
to
me
,
Doady
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cruel
,
my
precious
love
!
 
<EOS>
As
if
I
would
---
or
could
---
be
cruel
to
you
,
for
the
world
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
do
n't
find
fault
with
me
,
"
said
Dora
,
making
a
rosebud
of
her
mouth
;
"
and
I
'll
be
good
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
charmed
by
her
presently
asking
me
,
of
her
own
accord
,
to
give
her
that
cookery
-
book
I
had
once
spoken
of
,
and
to
show
her
how
to
keep
accounts
as
I
had
once
promised
I
would
.
 
<EOS>
I
brought
the
volume
with
me
on
my
next
visit
<EOS>
(
I
got
it
prettily
bound
,
first
,
to
make
it
look
less
dry
and
more
inviting
)
;
and
as
we
strolled
about
the
Common
,
I
showed
her
an
old
housekeeping
-
book
of
my
aunt
's
,
and
gave
her
a
set
of
tablets
,
and
a
pretty
little
pencil
-
case
and
box
of
leads
,
to
practise
housekeeping
with
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
cookery
-
book
made
Dora
's
head
ache
,
and
the
figures
made
her
cry
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
n't
add
up
,
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
rubbed
them
out
,
and
drew
little
nosegays
and
likenesses
of
me
and
Jip
,
all
over
the
tablets
.
   
<EOS>
Then
I
playfully
tried
verbal
instruction
in
domestic
matters
,
as
we
walked
about
on
a
Saturday
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
for
example
,
when
we
passed
a
butcher
's
shop
,
I
would
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
Now
suppose
,
my
pet
,
that
we
were
married
,
and
you
were
going
to
buy
a
shoulder
of
mutton
for
dinner
,
would
you
know
how
to
buy
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
My
pretty
little
Dora
's
face
would
fall
,
and
she
would
make
her
mouth
into
a
bud
again
,
as
if
she
would
very
much
prefer
to
shut
mine
with
a
kiss
.
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
know
how
to
buy
it
,
my
darling
?
<EOS>
"
I
would
repeat
,
perhaps
,
if
I
were
very
inflexible
.
   
<EOS>
Dora
would
think
a
little
,
and
then
reply
,
perhaps
,
with
great
triumph
:
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
butcher
would
know
how
to
sell
it
,
and
what
need
I
know
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
silly
boy
!
"
   
<EOS>
So
,
when
I
once
asked
Dora
,
with
an
eye
to
the
cookery
-
book
,
what
she
would
do
,
if
we
were
married
,
and
I
were
to
say
I
should
like
a
nice
Irish
stew
,
she
replied
that
she
would
tell
the
servant
to
make
it
;
and
then
clapped
her
little
hands
together
across
my
arm
,
and
laughed
in
such
a
charming
manner
that
she
was
more
delightful
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
Consequently
,
the
principal
use
to
which
the
cookery
-
book
was
devoted
,
was
being
put
down
in
the
corner
for
Jip
to
stand
upon
.
<EOS>
But
Dora
was
so
pleased
,
<EOS>
when
she
had
trained
him
to
stand
upon
it
without
offering
to
come
off
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
hold
the
pencil
-
case
in
his
mouth
,
that
I
was
very
glad
I
had
bought
it
.
   
<EOS>
And
we
fell
back
on
the
guitar
-
case
,
and
the
flower
-
painting
,
and
the
songs
about
never
leaving
off
dancing
,
<EOS>
Ta
ra
la
!
and
were
as
happy
as
the
week
was
long
.
 
<EOS>
I
occasionally
wished
I
could
venture
to
hint
to
Miss
Lavinia
,
that
she
treated
the
darling
of
my
heart
a
little
too
much
like
a
plaything
;
and
I
sometimes
awoke
,
as
it
were
,
wondering
to
find
that
I
had
fallen
into
the
general
fault
,
and
treated
her
like
a
plaything
too
---
but
not
often
.

<EOS>
Mischief
 
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
it
were
not
for
me
to
record
,
even
though
this
manuscript
is
intended
for
no
eyes
but
mine
,
how
hard
I
worked
at
that
tremendous
short
-
hand
,
and
all
improvement
appertaining
to
it
,
in
my
sense
of
responsibility
to
Dora
and
her
aunts
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
only
add
,
to
what
I
have
already
written
of
my
perseverance
at
this
time
of
my
life
,
and
of
a
patient
and
continuous
energy
which
then
began
to
be
matured
within
me
,
and
which
I
know
to
be
the
strong
part
of
my
character
,
if
it
have
any
strength
at
all
,
that
there
,
on
looking
back
,
I
find
the
source
of
my
success
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
very
fortunate
in
worldly
matters
;
many
men
have
worked
much
harder
,
and
not
succeeded
half
so
well
;
but
I
never
could
have
done
what
I
have
done
,
without
the
habits
of
punctuality
,
order
,
and
diligence
,
without
the
determination
to
concentrate
myself
on
one
object
at
a
time
,
no
matter
how
quickly
its
successor
should
come
upon
its
heels
,
which
I
then
formed
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
knows
I
write
this
,
in
no
spirit
of
self
-
laudation
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
who
reviews
his
own
life
,
as
I
do
mine
,
in
going
on
here
,
from
page
to
page
,
had
need
to
have
been
a
good
man
indeed
,
if
he
would
be
spared
the
sharp
consciousness
of
many
talents
neglected
,
many
opportunities
wasted
,
many
erratic
and
perverted
feelings
constantly
at
war
within
his
breast
,
and
defeating
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
hold
one
natural
gift
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
that
I
have
not
abused
.
 
<EOS>
My
meaning
simply
is
,
that
whatever
I
have
tried
to
do
in
life
,
I
have
tried
with
all
my
heart
to
do
well
;
that
whatever
I
have
devoted
myself
to
,
I
have
devoted
myself
to
completely
;
that
in
great
aims
and
in
small
,
I
have
always
been
thoroughly
in
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
believed
it
possible
that
any
natural
or
improved
ability
can
claim
immunity
from
the
companionship
of
the
steady
,
plain
,
hard
-
working
qualities
,
and
hope
to
gain
its
end
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
such
thing
as
such
fulfilment
on
this
earth
.
 
<EOS>
Some
happy
talent
,
and
some
fortunate
opportunity
,
may
form
the
two
sides
of
the
ladder
on
which
some
men
mount
,
but
the
rounds
of
that
ladder
must
be
made
of
stuff
to
stand
wear
and
tear
;
and
there
is
no
substitute
for
thorough
-
going
,
ardent
,
and
sincere
earnestness
.
 
<EOS>
Never
to
put
one
hand
to
anything
,
on
which
I
could
throw
my
whole
self
;
and
never
to
affect
depreciation
of
my
work
,
whatever
it
was
;
I
find
,
now
,
to
have
been
my
golden
rules
.
   
<EOS>
How
much
of
the
practice
I
have
just
reduced
to
precept
<EOS>
,
I
owe
to
Agnes
,
I
will
not
repeat
here
.
 
<EOS>
My
narrative
proceeds
to
Agnes
,
with
a
thankful
love
.
   
<EOS>
She
came
on
a
visit
of
a
fortnight
to
the
Doctor
's
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
was
the
Doctor
's
old
friend
,
and
the
Doctor
wished
to
talk
with
him
,
and
do
him
good
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
matter
of
conversation
with
Agnes
when
she
was
last
in
town
,
and
this
visit
was
the
result
.
<EOS>
She
and
her
father
came
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
much
surprised
to
hear
from
her
that
she
had
engaged
to
find
a
lodging
in
the
neighbourhood
for
Mrs
Heep
,
whose
rheumatic
complaint
required
change
of
air
,
and
who
would
be
charmed
to
have
it
in
such
company
.
<EOS>
Neither
was
I
surprised
when
,
on
the
very
next
day
,
Uriah
,
like
a
dutiful
son
,
brought
his
worthy
mother
to
take
possession
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
said
he
,
as
he
forced
himself
upon
my
company
for
a
turn
in
the
Doctor
's
garden
,
"
where
a
person
loves
,
a
person
is
a
little
jealous
---
leastways
,
anxious
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
beloved
one
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
whom
are
you
jealous
,
now
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Thanks
to
you
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
he
returned
,
"
of
no
one
in
particular
just
at
present
---
no
male
person
,
at
least
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
that
you
are
jealous
of
a
female
person
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
gave
me
a
sidelong
glance
out
of
his
sinister
red
eyes
,
and
laughed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
he
said
,
"
---
I
should
say
Mister
,
but
I
know
you
'll
excuse
the
abit
I
've
got
into
---
you
're
so
insinuating
,
that
you
draw
me
like
a
corkscrew
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
do
n't
mind
telling
you
,
"
putting
his
fish
-
like
hand
on
mine
,
"
I
'm
not
a
lady
's
man
in
general
,
sir
,
and
I
never
was
,
with
Mrs
Strong
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
eyes
looked
green
now
,
as
they
watched
mine
with
a
rascally
cunning
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
though
I
am
a
lawyer
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
he
replied
,
with
a
dry
grin
,
"
I
mean
,
just
at
present
,
what
I
say
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
mean
by
your
look
?
<EOS>
"
I
retorted
,
quietly
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
my
look
?
 
<EOS>
Dear
me
,
Copperfield
,
that
's
sharp
practice
!
 
<EOS>
What
do
I
mean
by
my
look
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
By
your
look
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
seemed
very
much
amused
,
and
laughed
as
heartily
as
it
was
in
his
nature
to
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
scraping
of
his
chin
with
his
hand
,
he
went
on
to
say
,
with
his
eyes
cast
downward
---
still
scraping
,
very
slowly
:
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
was
but
an
umble
clerk
,
she
always
looked
down
upon
me
.
<EOS>
She
was
for
ever
having
my
Agnes
backwards
and
forwards
at
her
ouse
,
and
she
was
for
ever
being
a
friend
to
you
,
Master
Copperfield
;
but
I
was
too
far
beneath
her
,
myself
,
to
be
noticed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
said
I
;
"
suppose
you
were
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
---
And
beneath
him
too
,
"
pursued
Uriah
,
very
distinctly
,
and
in
a
meditative
tone
of
voice
,
as
he
continued
to
scrape
his
chin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
know
the
Doctor
better
,
"
said
I
,
"
than
to
suppose
him
conscious
of
your
existence
,
when
you
were
not
before
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
directed
his
eyes
at
me
in
that
sidelong
glance
again
,
and
he
made
his
face
very
lantern
-
jawed
,
for
the
greater
convenience
of
scraping
,
as
he
answered
:
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
I
am
not
referring
to
the
Doctor
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
no
,
poor
man
!
 
<EOS>
I
mean
Mr
Maldon
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
My
heart
quite
died
within
me
.
 
<EOS>
All
my
old
doubts
and
apprehensions
on
that
subject
,
all
the
Doctor
's
happiness
and
peace
,
all
the
mingled
possibilities
of
innocence
and
compromise
,
that
I
could
not
unravel
,
I
saw
,
in
a
moment
,
at
the
mercy
of
this
fellow
's
twisting
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
never
could
come
into
the
office
,
without
ordering
and
shoving
me
about
,
"
said
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
of
your
fine
gentlemen
he
was
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
very
meek
and
umble
---
and
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
did
n't
like
that
sort
of
thing
---
<EOS>
and
I
do
n't
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
left
off
scraping
his
chin
,
and
sucked
in
his
cheeks
until
they
seemed
to
meet
inside
;
keeping
his
sidelong
glance
upon
me
all
the
while
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
one
of
your
lovely
women
,
she
is
,
"
he
pursued
,
when
he
had
slowly
restored
his
face
to
its
natural
form
;
"
and
ready
to
be
no
friend
to
such
as
me
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
just
the
person
as
would
put
my
Agnes
up
to
higher
sort
of
game
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
ai
n't
one
of
your
lady
's
men
,
Master
Copperfield
;
but
I
've
had
eyes
in
my
ed
,
a
pretty
long
time
back
.
 
<EOS>
We
umble
ones
have
got
eyes
,
mostly
speaking
---
and
we
look
out
of
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
endeavoured
to
appear
unconscious
and
not
disquieted
,
but
<EOS>
,
I
saw
in
his
face
,
with
poor
success
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
'm
not
a
-
going
to
let
myself
be
run
down
,
Copperfield
,
"
he
continued
,
raising
that
part
of
his
countenance
,
where
his
red
eyebrows
would
have
been
if
he
had
had
any
,
with
malignant
triumph
,
"
and
I
shall
do
what
I
can
to
put
a
stop
to
this
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
approve
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
acknowledging
to
you
that
I
've
got
rather
a
grudging
disposition
,
and
want
to
keep
off
all
intruders
.
 
<EOS>
I
ai
n't
a
-
going
,
if
I
know
it
,
to
run
the
risk
of
being
plotted
against
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
always
plotting
,
and
delude
yourself
into
the
belief
that
everybody
else
is
doing
the
like
,
I
think
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Perhaps
so
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
've
got
a
motive
,
as
my
fellow
-
partner
used
to
say
;
and
I
go
at
it
tooth
and
nail
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
n't
be
put
upon
,
as
a
numble
person
,
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
allow
people
in
my
way
.
 
<EOS>
Really
they
must
come
out
of
the
cart
,
Master
Copperfield
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
,
though
?
"
he
returned
,
with
one
of
his
jerks
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
astonished
at
that
,
Master
Copperfield
,
you
being
usually
so
quick
!
<EOS>
I
'll
try
to
be
plainer
,
another
time
.
 
<EOS>
---
Is
that
Mr
Maldon
a
-
norseback
,
ringing
at
the
gate
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
looks
like
him
,
"
I
replied
,
as
carelessly
as
I
could
.
   
<EOS>
Uriah
stopped
short
,
put
his
hands
between
his
great
knobs
of
knees
,
and
doubled
himself
up
with
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
With
perfectly
silent
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
sound
escaped
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
repelled
by
his
odious
behaviour
,
particularly
by
this
concluding
instance
,
that
I
turned
away
without
any
ceremony
;
and
left
him
doubled
up
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
,
like
a
scarecrow
in
want
of
support
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
on
that
evening
;
but
,
as
I
well
remember
,
on
the
next
evening
but
one
,
which
was
a
Sunday
;
that
I
took
Agnes
to
see
Dora
.
<EOS>
I
had
arranged
the
visit
,
beforehand
,
with
Miss
Lavinia
;
and
Agnes
was
expected
to
tea
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
in
a
flutter
of
pride
and
anxiety
;
pride
in
my
dear
little
betrothed
,
and
anxiety
that
Agnes
should
like
her
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
way
to
Putney
,
Agnes
being
inside
the
stage
-
coach
,
and
I
outside
,
I
pictured
Dora
to
myself
in
every
one
of
the
pretty
looks
I
knew
so
well
;
now
making
up
my
mind
that
I
should
like
her
to
look
exactly
as
she
looked
at
such
a
time
,
and
then
doubting
whether
I
should
not
prefer
her
looking
as
she
looked
at
such
another
time
;
and
almost
worrying
myself
into
a
fever
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
troubled
by
no
doubt
of
her
being
very
pretty
,
in
any
case
;
but
it
fell
out
that
I
had
never
seen
her
look
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
not
in
the
drawing
-
room
when
I
presented
Agnes
to
her
little
aunts
,
but
was
shyly
keeping
out
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
where
to
look
for
her
,
now
;
and
sure
enough
I
found
her
stopping
her
ears
again
,
behind
the
same
dull
old
door
.
   
<EOS>
At
first
she
would
n't
come
at
all
;
and
then
she
pleaded
for
five
minutes
by
my
watch
.
 
<EOS>
When
at
length
she
put
her
arm
through
mine
,
to
be
taken
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
her
charming
little
face
was
flushed
,
and
had
never
been
so
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
when
we
went
into
the
room
,
and
it
turned
pale
,
she
was
ten
thousand
times
prettier
yet
.
   
<EOS>
Dora
was
afraid
of
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
told
me
that
she
knew
Agnes
was
"
too
clever
"
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
she
saw
her
looking
at
once
so
cheerful
and
so
earnest
,
and
so
thoughtful
,
and
so
good
,
she
gave
a
faint
little
cry
of
pleased
surprise
,
and
just
put
her
affectionate
arms
round
Agnes
's
neck
,
and
laid
her
innocent
cheek
against
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
I
never
was
so
happy
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
was
so
pleased
as
when
I
saw
those
two
sit
down
together
,
side
by
side
.
 
<EOS>
As
when
I
saw
my
little
darling
looking
up
so
naturally
to
those
cordial
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
As
when
I
saw
the
tender
,
beautiful
regard
which
Agnes
cast
upon
her
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
and
Miss
Clarissa
partook
,
in
their
way
,
of
my
joy
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
pleasantest
tea
-
table
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Clarissa
presided
.
 
<EOS>
I
cut
and
handed
the
sweet
seed
-
cake
---
the
little
sisters
had
a
bird
-
like
fondness
for
picking
up
seeds
and
pecking
at
sugar
;
Miss
Lavinia
looked
on
with
benignant
patronage
,
as
if
our
happy
love
were
all
her
work
;
and
we
were
perfectly
contented
with
ourselves
and
one
another
.
   
<EOS>
The
gentle
cheerfulness
of
Agnes
went
to
all
their
hearts
.
 
<EOS>
Her
quiet
interest
in
everything
that
interested
Dora
;
her
manner
of
making
acquaintance
with
Jip
(
who
responded
instantly
)
;
her
pleasant
way
,
when
Dora
was
ashamed
to
come
over
to
her
usual
seat
by
me
;
her
modest
grace
and
ease
,
eliciting
a
crowd
of
blushing
little
marks
of
confidence
from
Dora
;
seemed
to
make
our
circle
quite
complete
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
,
"
said
Dora
,
after
tea
,
"
that
you
like
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
think
you
would
;
and
I
want
,
more
than
ever
,
to
be
liked
,
now
Julia
Mills
is
gone
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
omitted
to
mention
it
,
by
the
by
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Mills
had
sailed
,
and
Dora
and
I
had
gone
aboard
a
great
East
Indiaman
at
Gravesend
to
see
her
;
and
we
had
had
preserved
ginger
,
and
guava
,
and
other
delicacies
of
that
sort
for
lunch
;
and
we
had
left
Miss
Mills
weeping
on
a
camp
-
stool
on
the
quarter
-
deck
,
with
a
large
new
diary
under
her
arm
,
in
which
the
original
reflections
awakened
by
the
contemplation
of
Ocean
were
to
be
recorded
under
lock
and
key
.
   
<EOS>
Agnes
said
she
was
afraid
I
must
have
given
her
an
unpromising
character
;
but
Dora
corrected
that
directly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
shaking
her
curls
at
me
;
"
it
was
all
praise
.
 
<EOS>
He
thinks
so
much
of
your
opinion
,
that
I
was
quite
afraid
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
good
opinion
can
not
strengthen
his
attachment
to
some
people
whom
he
knows
,
"
said
Agnes
,
with
a
smile
;
"
it
is
not
worth
their
having
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
please
let
me
have
it
,
"
said
Dora
,
in
her
coaxing
way
,
"
if
you
can
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
made
merry
about
Dora
's
wanting
to
be
liked
,
and
Dora
said
I
was
a
goose
,
and
she
did
n't
like
me
at
any
rate
,
and
the
short
evening
flew
away
on
gossamer
-
wings
.
 
<EOS>
The
time
was
at
hand
when
the
coach
was
to
call
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
standing
alone
before
the
fire
,
when
Dora
came
stealing
softly
in
,
to
give
me
that
usual
precious
little
kiss
before
I
went
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
think
,
if
I
had
had
her
for
a
friend
a
long
time
ago
,
Doady
,
"
said
Dora
,
her
bright
eyes
shining
very
brightly
,
and
her
little
right
hand
idly
busying
itself
with
one
of
the
buttons
of
my
coat
,
<EOS>
"
I
might
have
been
more
clever
perhaps
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
love
!
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
"
what
nonsense
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
it
is
nonsense
?
"
returned
Dora
,
without
looking
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
it
is
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
am
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
forgotten
,
"
said
Dora
,
still
turning
the
button
round
and
round
,
"
what
relation
Agnes
is
to
you
,
<EOS>
you
dear
bad
boy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
blood
-
relation
,
"
I
replied
;
"
but
we
were
brought
up
together
,
like
brother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
why
you
ever
fell
in
love
with
me
?
"
said
Dora
,
beginning
on
another
button
of
my
coat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
because
I
could
n't
see
you
,
and
not
love
you
,
Dora
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Suppose
you
had
never
seen
me
at
all
,
"
said
Dora
,
going
to
another
button
.
   
<EOS>
"
Suppose
we
had
never
been
born
!
"
<EOS>
said
I
,
gaily
.
   
<EOS>
I
wondered
what
she
was
thinking
about
,
as
I
glanced
in
admiring
silence
at
the
little
soft
hand
travelling
up
the
row
of
buttons
on
my
coat
,
and
at
the
clustering
hair
that
lay
against
my
breast
,
and
at
the
lashes
of
her
downcast
eyes
,
slightly
rising
as
they
followed
her
idle
fingers
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
her
eyes
were
lifted
up
to
mine
,
and
she
stood
on
tiptoe
to
give
me
,
more
thoughtfully
than
usual
,
that
precious
little
kiss
---
once
,
twice
,
three
times
---
and
went
out
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
They
all
came
back
together
within
five
minutes
afterwards
,
and
Dora
's
unusual
thoughtfulness
was
quite
gone
then
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
laughingly
resolved
to
put
Jip
through
the
whole
of
his
performances
,
before
the
coach
came
.
 
<EOS>
They
took
some
time
(
not
so
much
on
account
of
their
variety
,
as
Jip
's
reluctance
)
,
and
were
still
unfinished
when
it
was
heard
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
hurried
but
affectionate
parting
between
Agnes
and
herself
;
and
Dora
was
to
write
to
Agnes
(
who
was
not
to
mind
her
letters
being
foolish
,
she
said
)
,
and
Agnes
was
to
write
to
Dora
;
and
they
had
a
second
parting
at
the
coach
door
,
and
a
third
when
Dora
,
in
spite
of
the
remonstrances
of
Miss
Lavinia
,
would
come
running
out
once
more
to
remind
Agnes
at
the
coach
window
about
writing
,
and
to
shake
her
curls
at
me
on
the
box
.
   
<EOS>
The
stage
-
coach
was
to
put
us
down
near
Covent
Garden
,
where
we
were
to
take
another
stage
-
coach
for
Highgate
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
impatient
for
the
short
walk
in
the
interval
,
that
Agnes
might
praise
Dora
to
me
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
what
praise
it
was
!
 
<EOS>
How
lovingly
and
fervently
did
it
commend
the
pretty
creature
I
had
won
,
with
all
her
artless
graces
best
displayed
,
to
my
most
gentle
care
!
 
<EOS>
How
thoughtfully
remind
me
,
yet
with
no
pretence
of
doing
so
,
of
the
trust
in
which
I
held
the
orphan
child
!
   
<EOS>
Never
,
never
,
had
I
loved
Dora
so
deeply
and
truly
,
as
I
loved
her
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
had
again
alighted
,
and
were
walking
in
the
starlight
along
the
quiet
road
that
led
to
the
Doctor
's
house
,
I
told
Agnes
it
was
her
doing
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
you
were
sitting
by
her
,
"
said
I
,
"
you
seemed
to
be
no
less
her
guardian
angel
than
mine
;
and
you
seem
so
now
,
Agnes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
poor
angel
,
"
she
returned
,
"
but
faithful
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
clear
tone
of
her
voice
,
going
straight
to
my
heart
,
made
it
natural
to
me
to
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
The
cheerfulness
that
belongs
to
you
,
Agnes
(
<EOS>
and
to
no
one
else
that
ever
I
have
seen
)
,
is
so
restored
,
I
have
observed
today
,
that
I
have
begun
to
hope
you
are
happier
at
home
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
happier
in
myself
,
"
she
said
;
"
I
am
quite
cheerful
and
light
-
hearted
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
glanced
at
the
serene
face
looking
upward
,
and
thought
it
was
the
stars
that
made
it
seem
so
noble
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
has
been
no
change
at
home
,
"
said
Agnes
,
after
a
few
moments
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
fresh
reference
,
"
said
I
,
"
<EOS>
to
---
<EOS>
I
would
n't
distress
you
,
Agnes
,
but
I
can
not
help
asking
---
to
what
we
spoke
of
,
when
we
parted
last
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
none
,
"
she
answered
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
thought
so
much
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
think
less
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
that
I
confide
in
simple
love
and
truth
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
Have
no
apprehensions
for
me
,
Trotwood
<EOS>
,
"
she
added
,
after
a
moment
;
"
the
step
you
dread
my
taking
,
I
shall
never
take
.
"
   
<EOS>
Although
I
think
I
had
never
really
feared
it
,
in
any
season
of
cool
reflection
,
it
was
an
unspeakable
relief
to
me
to
have
this
assurance
from
her
own
truthful
lips
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
so
,
earnestly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
this
visit
is
over
,
"
said
I
,
---
<EOS>
"
for
we
may
not
be
alone
another
time
,
---
<EOS>
how
long
is
it
likely
to
be
,
my
dear
Agnes
,
before
you
come
to
London
again
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Probably
a
long
time
,
"
she
replied
;
"
I
think
it
will
be
best
---
for
papa
's
sake
---
to
remain
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
not
likely
to
meet
often
,
for
some
time
to
come
;
but
I
shall
be
a
good
correspondent
of
Dora
's
,
and
we
shall
frequently
hear
of
one
another
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
were
now
within
the
little
courtyard
of
the
Doctor
's
cottage
.
<EOS>
It
was
growing
late
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
light
in
the
window
of
Mrs
Strong
's
chamber
,
and
Agnes
,
pointing
to
it
,
bade
me
good
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
not
be
troubled
,
"
she
said
,
giving
me
her
hand
,
"
by
our
misfortunes
and
anxieties
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
be
happier
in
nothing
than
in
your
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
can
ever
give
me
help
,
rely
upon
it
I
will
ask
you
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
always
!
"
<EOS>
In
her
beaming
smile
,
and
in
these
last
tones
of
her
cheerful
voice
,
I
seemed
again
to
see
and
hear
my
little
Dora
in
her
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
stood
awhile
,
looking
through
the
porch
at
the
stars
,
with
a
heart
full
of
love
and
gratitude
,
and
then
walked
slowly
forth
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
engaged
a
bed
at
a
decent
alehouse
close
by
,
and
was
going
out
at
the
gate
,
when
,
happening
to
turn
my
head
,
I
saw
a
light
in
the
Doctor
's
study
.
 
<EOS>
A
half
-
reproachful
fancy
came
into
my
mind
,
that
he
had
been
working
at
the
Dictionary
without
my
help
.
<EOS>
With
the
view
of
seeing
if
this
were
so
,
and
,
in
any
case
,
of
bidding
him
good
night
,
if
he
were
yet
sitting
among
his
books
,
I
turned
back
,
and
going
softly
across
the
hall
,
and
gently
opening
the
door
,
looked
in
.
   
<EOS>
The
first
person
whom
I
saw
,
to
my
surprise
,
by
the
sober
light
of
the
shaded
lamp
,
was
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
standing
close
beside
it
,
with
one
of
his
skeleton
hands
over
his
mouth
,
and
the
other
resting
on
the
Doctor
's
table
.
 
<EOS>
The
Doctor
sat
in
his
study
chair
,
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
,
sorely
troubled
and
distressed
,
was
leaning
forward
,
irresolutely
touching
the
Doctor
's
arm
.
   
<EOS>
For
an
instant
,
I
supposed
that
the
Doctor
was
ill
.
 
<EOS>
I
hastily
advanced
a
step
under
that
impression
,
when
I
met
Uriah
's
eye
,
and
saw
what
was
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
withdrawn
,
but
the
Doctor
made
a
gesture
to
detain
me
,
and
I
remained
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
"
observed
Uriah
,
with
a
writhe
of
his
ungainly
person
,
"
we
may
keep
the
door
shut
.
 
<EOS>
We
need
n't
make
it
known
to
ALL
the
town
.
"
   
<EOS>
Saying
which
,
he
went
on
his
toes
to
the
door
,
which
I
had
left
open
,
and
carefully
closed
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
came
back
,
and
took
up
his
former
position
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
obtrusive
show
of
compassionate
zeal
in
his
voice
and
manner
,
more
intolerable
---
at
least
to
me
---
than
any
demeanour
he
could
have
assumed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
felt
it
incumbent
upon
me
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
said
Uriah
,
"
to
point
out
to
Doctor
Strong
what
you
and
me
have
already
talked
about
.
 
<EOS>
You
did
n't
exactly
understand
me
,
though
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
gave
him
a
look
,
but
no
other
answer
;
and
,
going
to
my
good
old
master
,
said
a
few
words
that
I
meant
to
be
words
of
comfort
and
encouragement
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
,
as
it
had
been
his
custom
to
do
when
I
was
quite
a
little
fellow
,
but
did
not
lift
his
grey
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
As
you
did
n't
understand
me
,
Master
Copperfield
,
"
resumed
Uriah
in
the
same
officious
manner
,
"
I
may
take
the
liberty
of
umbly
mentioning
,
being
among
friends
,
that
I
have
called
Doctor
Strong
's
attention
to
the
goings
-
on
of
Mrs
Strong
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
much
against
the
grain
with
me
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
Copperfield
,
to
be
concerned
in
anything
so
unpleasant
;
but
really
,
as
it
is
,
we
're
all
mixing
ourselves
up
with
what
ought
n't
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
what
my
meaning
was
,
sir
,
when
you
did
n't
understand
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
now
,
when
I
recall
his
leer
,
that
I
did
not
collar
him
,
and
try
to
shake
the
breath
out
of
his
body
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
I
did
n't
make
myself
very
clear
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
nor
you
neither
.
 
<EOS>
Naturally
,
we
was
both
of
us
inclined
to
give
such
a
subject
a
wide
berth
.
 
<EOS>
Hows'ever
,
at
last
I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
speak
plain
;
and
I
have
mentioned
to
Doctor
Strong
that
---
did
you
speak
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
to
the
Doctor
,
who
had
moaned
.
 
<EOS>
The
sound
might
have
touched
any
heart
,
I
thought
,
but
it
had
no
effect
upon
Uriah
's
.
   
"
---
mentioned
to
Doctor
Strong
,
"
he
proceeded
,
"
that
anyone
may
see
that
Mr
Maldon
,
and
the
lovely
and
agreeable
lady
as
is
Doctor
Strong
's
wife
,
are
too
sweet
on
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
Really
the
time
is
come
(
we
being
at
present
all
mixing
ourselves
up
with
what
ought
n't
to
be
)
,
when
Doctor
Strong
must
be
told
that
this
was
full
as
plain
to
everybody
as
the
sun
,
before
Mr
Maldon
went
to
India
;
that
Mr
Maldon
made
excuses
to
come
back
,
for
nothing
else
;
and
that
he
's
always
here
,
for
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
come
in
,
sir
,
I
was
just
putting
it
to
my
fellow
-
partner
,
"
towards
whom
he
turned
,
"
to
say
to
Doctor
Strong
upon
his
word
and
honour
,
whether
he
'd
ever
been
of
this
opinion
long
ago
,
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
Mr
Wickfield
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
Would
you
be
so
good
as
tell
us
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
<EOS>
or
no
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Come
,
partner
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
God
's
sake
,
my
dear
Doctor
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
again
laying
his
irresolute
hand
upon
the
Doctor
's
arm
,
"
do
n't
attach
too
much
weight
to
any
suspicions
I
may
have
entertained
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
cried
Uriah
,
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
melancholy
confirmation
:
ai
n't
it
?
 
<EOS>
Him
!
 
<EOS>
Such
an
old
friend
!
 
<EOS>
Bless
your
soul
,
when
I
was
nothing
but
a
clerk
in
his
office
,
Copperfield
<EOS>
,
I
've
seen
him
twenty
times
,
if
I
've
seen
him
once
,
quite
in
a
taking
about
it
---
quite
put
out
,
you
know
<EOS>
(
and
very
proper
in
him
as
a
father
;
I
'm
sure
I
ca
n't
blame
him
)
,
to
think
that
Miss
Agnes
was
mixing
herself
up
with
what
ought
n't
to
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Strong
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
in
a
tremulous
voice
,
"
my
good
friend
<EOS>
,
I
need
n't
tell
you
that
it
has
been
my
vice
to
look
for
some
one
master
motive
in
everybody
,
and
to
try
all
actions
by
one
narrow
test
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
fallen
into
such
doubts
as
I
have
had
,
through
this
mistake
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
had
doubts
,
Wickfield
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
without
lifting
up
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
had
doubts
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Speak
up
,
fellow
-
partner
,
"
urged
Uriah
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
,
at
one
time
,
certainly
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
---
God
forgive
me
<EOS>
---
I
thought
YOU
had
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
!
"
returned
the
Doctor
,
in
a
tone
of
most
pathetic
grief
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
at
one
time
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
,
"
that
you
wished
to
send
Maldon
abroad
to
effect
a
desirable
separation
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
!
"
returned
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
give
Annie
pleasure
,
by
making
some
provision
for
the
companion
of
her
childhood
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
else
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
I
found
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
doubt
it
,
when
you
told
me
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
thought
---
I
implore
you
to
remember
the
narrow
construction
which
has
been
my
besetting
sin
---
that
,
in
a
case
where
there
was
so
much
disparity
in
point
of
years
---
"
   
"
That
's
the
way
to
put
it
,
you
see
,
Master
Copperfield
!
"
<EOS>
observed
Uriah
,
with
fawning
and
offensive
pity
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
a
lady
of
such
youth
,
and
such
attractions
,
however
real
her
respect
for
you
,
might
have
been
influenced
in
marrying
,
by
worldly
considerations
only
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
no
allowance
for
innumerable
feelings
and
circumstances
that
may
have
all
tended
to
good
.
 
<EOS>
For
Heaven
's
sake
remember
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
kind
he
puts
it
!
"
said
Uriah
,
shaking
his
head

<EOS>
"
Always
observing
her
from
one
point
of
view
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
;
"
but
by
all
that
is
dear
to
you
,
my
old
friend
,
I
entreat
you
to
consider
what
it
was
;
I
am
forced
to
confess
now
,
having
no
escape
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
No
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
no
way
out
of
it
,
Mr
Wickfield
,
sir
,
"
observed
Uriah
,
"
when
it
's
got
to
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
---
that
I
did
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
,
glancing
helplessly
and
distractedly
at
his
partner
,
"
that
I
did
doubt
her
,
and
think
her
wanting
in
her
duty
to
you
;
and
that
I
did
sometimes
,
if
I
must
say
all
,
feel
averse
to
Agnes
being
in
such
a
familiar
relation
towards
her
,
as
to
see
what
I
saw
,
or
in
my
diseased
theory
fancied
that
I
saw
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
mentioned
this
to
anyone
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
meant
it
to
be
known
to
anyone
.
 
<EOS>
And
though
it
is
terrible
to
you
to
hear
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
,
quite
subdued
,
"
if
you
knew
how
terrible
it
is
for
me
to
tell
,
you
would
feel
compassion
for
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
,
in
the
perfect
goodness
of
his
nature
,
put
out
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
held
it
for
a
little
while
in
his
,
with
his
head
bowed
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Uriah
,
writhing
himself
into
the
silence
like
a
Conger
-
eel
,
"
that
this
is
a
subject
full
of
unpleasantness
to
everybody
.
 
<EOS>
But
since
we
have
got
so
far
,
I
ought
to
take
the
liberty
of
mentioning
that
Copperfield
has
noticed
it
too
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
turned
upon
him
,
and
asked
him
how
he
dared
refer
to
me
!
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
's
very
kind
of
you
,
Copperfield
,
"
returned
Uriah
,
undulating
all
over
,
"
and
we
all
know
what
an
amiable
character
yours
is
;
but
you
know
that
the
moment
I
spoke
to
you
the
other
night
,
you
knew
what
I
meant
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
you
knew
what
I
meant
,
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
deny
it
!
 
<EOS>
You
deny
it
with
the
best
intentions
;
but
do
n't
do
it
,
Copperfield
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
saw
the
mild
eye
of
the
good
old
Doctor
turned
upon
me
for
a
moment
,
and
I
felt
that
the
confession
of
my
old
misgivings
and
remembrances
was
too
plainly
written
in
my
face
to
be
overlooked
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
no
use
raging
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
undo
that
.
 
<EOS>
Say
what
I
would
,
I
could
not
unsay
it
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
silent
again
,
and
remained
so
,
until
the
Doctor
rose
and
walked
twice
or
thrice
across
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
he
returned
to
where
his
chair
stood
;
and
,
leaning
on
the
back
of
it
,
and
occasionally
putting
his
handkerchief
to
his
eyes
,
with
a
simple
honesty
that
did
him
more
honour
,
to
my
thinking
,
than
any
disguise
he
could
have
effected
,
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
much
to
blame
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
been
very
much
to
blame
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
exposed
one
whom
I
hold
in
my
heart
,
to
trials
and
aspersions
<EOS>
---
I
call
them
aspersions
,
even
to
have
been
conceived
in
anybody
's
inmost
mind
---
of
which
she
never
,
but
for
me
,
could
have
been
the
object
.
"
   
<EOS>
Uriah
Heep
gave
a
kind
of
snivel
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
to
express
sympathy
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
which
my
Annie
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
"
never
,
but
for
me
,
could
have
been
the
object
.
 
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
I
am
old
now
,
as
you
know
;
I
do
not
feel
,
tonight
,
that
I
have
much
to
live
for
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
life
---
my
Life
---
upon
the
truth
and
honour
of
the
dear
lady
who
has
been
the
subject
of
this
conversation
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
the
best
embodiment
of
chivalry
,
the
realization
of
the
handsomest
and
most
romantic
figure
ever
imagined
by
painter
,
could
have
said
this
,
with
a
more
impressive
and
affecting
dignity
than
the
plain
old
Doctor
did
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
not
prepared
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
to
deny
---
<EOS>
perhaps
I
may
have
been
,
without
knowing
it
,
in
some
degree
prepared
to
admit
---
that
I
may
have
unwittingly
ensnared
that
lady
into
an
unhappy
marriage
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
man
quite
unaccustomed
to
observe
;
and
I
can
not
but
believe
that
the
observation
of
several
people
,
of
different
ages
and
positions
,
all
too
plainly
tending
in
one
direction
(
and
that
so
natural
)
,
is
better
than
mine
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
had
often
admired
,
as
I
have
elsewhere
described
,
his
benignant
manner
towards
his
youthful
wife
;
but
the
respectful
tenderness
he
manifested
in
every
reference
to
her
on
this
occasion
,
and
the
almost
reverential
manner
in
which
he
put
away
from
him
the
lightest
doubt
of
her
integrity
,
exalted
him
,
in
my
eyes
,
beyond
description
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
married
that
lady
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
"
when
she
was
extremely
young
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
her
to
myself
when
her
character
was
scarcely
formed
.
 
<EOS>
So
far
as
it
was
developed
,
it
had
been
my
happiness
to
form
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
her
father
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
her
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
taught
her
what
I
could
,
for
the
love
of
all
her
beautiful
and
virtuous
qualities
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
did
her
wrong
;
as
I
fear
I
did
,
in
taking
advantage
(
but
I
never
meant
it
)
of
her
gratitude
and
her
affection
;
I
ask
pardon
of
that
lady
,
in
my
heart
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
walked
across
the
room
,
and
came
back
to
the
same
place
;
holding
the
chair
with
a
grasp
that
trembled
,
like
his
subdued
voice
,
in
its
earnestness
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
regarded
myself
as
a
refuge
,
for
her
,
from
the
dangers
and
vicissitudes
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
persuaded
myself
that
,
unequal
though
we
were
in
years
,
she
would
live
tranquilly
and
contentedly
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
shut
out
of
my
consideration
the
time
when
I
should
leave
her
free
,
and
still
young
and
still
beautiful
,
but
with
her
judgement
more
matured
---
no
,
gentlemen
---
upon
my
truth
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
homely
figure
seemed
to
be
lightened
up
by
his
fidelity
and
generosity
.
 
<EOS>
Every
word
he
uttered
had
a
force
that
no
other
grace
could
have
imparted
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
life
with
this
lady
has
been
very
happy
.
 
<EOS>
Until
tonight
,
I
have
had
uninterrupted
occasion
to
bless
the
day
on
which
I
did
her
great
injustice
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
voice
,
more
and
more
faltering
in
the
utterance
of
these
words
,
stopped
for
a
few
moments
;
then
he
went
on
:
   
"
<EOS>
Once
awakened
from
my
dream
---
I
have
been
a
poor
dreamer
,
in
one
way
or
other
,
all
my
life
<EOS>
---
I
see
how
natural
it
is
that
she
should
have
some
regretful
feeling
towards
her
old
companion
and
her
equal
.
 
<EOS>
That
she
does
regard
him
with
some
innocent
regret
,
with
some
blameless
thoughts
of
what
might
have
been
,
but
for
me
,
is
,
I
fear
,
too
true
.
 
<EOS>
Much
that
I
have
seen
,
but
not
noted
,
has
come
back
upon
me
with
new
meaning
,
during
this
last
trying
hour
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
beyond
this
,
gentlemen
,
the
dear
lady
's
name
never
must
be
coupled
with
a
word
,
a
breath
,
of
doubt
.
"
   
<EOS>
For
a
little
while
,
his
eye
kindled
and
his
voice
was
firm
;
for
a
little
while
he
was
again
silent
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
,
he
proceeded
as
before
:
   
<EOS>
"
It
only
remains
for
me
,
to
bear
the
knowledge
of
the
unhappiness
I
have
occasioned
,
as
submissively
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
she
who
should
reproach
;
not
I.
 
<EOS>
To
save
her
from
misconstruction
,
cruel
misconstruction
,
that
even
my
friends
have
not
been
able
to
avoid
,
becomes
my
duty
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
retired
we
live
,
the
better
I
shall
discharge
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
the
time
comes
---
may
it
come
soon
,
if
it
be
His
merciful
pleasure
!
<EOS>
---
when
my
death
shall
release
her
from
constraint
,
I
shall
close
my
eyes
upon
her
honoured
face
,
with
unbounded
confidence
and
love
;
and
leave
her
,
with
no
sorrow
then
,
to
happier
and
brighter
days
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
him
for
the
tears
which
his
earnestness
and
goodness
,
so
adorned
by
,
and
so
adorning
,
the
perfect
simplicity
of
his
manner
,
brought
into
my
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
moved
to
the
door
,
when
he
added
:
   
"
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
I
have
shown
you
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
will
respect
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
we
have
said
tonight
is
never
to
be
said
more
.
<EOS>
Wickfield
,
give
me
an
old
friend
's
arm
upstairs
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
hastened
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Without
interchanging
a
word
they
went
slowly
out
of
the
room
together
,
Uriah
looking
after
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Master
Copperfield
!
<EOS>
"
said
Uriah
,
meekly
turning
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
thing
has
n't
took
quite
the
turn
that
might
have
been
expected
,
for
the
old
Scholar
---
what
an
excellent
man
!
<EOS>
---
is
as
blind
as
a
brickbat
;
but
this
family
's
out
of
the
cart
,
I
think
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
needed
but
the
sound
of
his
voice
to
be
so
madly
enraged
as
I
never
was
before
,
and
never
have
been
since
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
villain
,
"
said
I
,
"
what
do
you
mean
by
entrapping
me
into
your
schemes
?
 
<EOS>
How
dare
you
appeal
to
me
just
now
,
you
false
rascal
,
as
if
we
had
been
in
discussion
together
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
we
stood
,
front
to
front
,
I
saw
so
plainly
,
in
the
stealthy
exultation
of
his
face
,
what
I
already
so
plainly
knew
;
I
mean
that
he
forced
his
confidence
upon
me
,
expressly
to
make
me
miserable
,
and
had
set
a
deliberate
trap
for
me
in
this
very
matter
;
that
I
could
n't
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
of
his
lank
cheek
was
invitingly
before
me
,
and
I
struck
it
with
my
open
hand
with
that
force
that
my
fingers
tingled
as
if
I
had
burnt
them
.
   
<EOS>
He
caught
the
hand
in
his
,
and
we
stood
in
that
connexion
,
looking
at
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
We
stood
so
,
a
long
time
;
long
enough
for
me
to
see
the
white
marks
of
my
fingers
die
out
of
the
deep
red
of
his
cheek
,
and
leave
it
a
deeper
red
.
   
<EOS>
"
Copperfield
,
"
he
said
at
length
,
in
a
breathless
voice
,
"
<EOS>
have
you
taken
leave
of
your
senses
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
taken
leave
of
you
,
"
said
I
,
wresting
my
hand
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
dog
,
I
'll
know
no
more
of
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
?
"
said
he
,
constrained
by
the
pain
of
his
cheek
to
put
his
hand
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
wo
n't
be
able
to
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
Is
n't
this
ungrateful
of
you
,
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
shown
you
often
enough
,
"
said
I
,
"
that
I
despise
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
shown
you
now
,
more
plainly
,
that
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
I
dread
your
doing
your
worst
to
all
about
you
?
 
<EOS>
What
else
do
you
ever
do
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
perfectly
understood
this
allusion
to
the
considerations
that
had
hitherto
restrained
me
in
my
communications
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
rather
think
that
neither
the
blow
,
nor
the
allusion
,
would
have
escaped
me
,
but
for
the
assurance
I
had
had
from
Agnes
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
no
matter
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
another
long
pause
.
 
<EOS>
His
eyes
,
as
he
looked
at
me
,
seemed
to
take
every
shade
of
colour
that
could
make
eyes
ugly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Copperfield
,
"
he
said
,
removing
his
hand
from
his
cheek
,
"
you
have
always
gone
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
always
used
to
be
against
me
at
Mr
Wickfield
's
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
think
what
you
like
,
"
said
I
,
still
in
a
towering
rage
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
is
not
true
,
so
much
the
worthier
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
I
always
liked
you
,
Copperfield
!
"
<EOS>
he
rejoined
.
   
<EOS>
I
deigned
to
make
him
no
reply
;
and
,
taking
up
my
hat
,
was
going
out
to
bed
,
when
he
came
between
me
and
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Copperfield
,
"
he
said
,
"
there
must
be
two
parties
to
a
quarrel
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
be
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
go
to
the
devil
!
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
that
!
"
<EOS>
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
'll
be
sorry
afterwards
.
<EOS>
How
can
you
make
yourself
so
inferior
to
me
,
as
to
show
such
a
bad
spirit
?
 
<EOS>
But
I
forgive
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
forgive
me
!
"
<EOS>
I
repeated
disdainfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
and
you
ca
n't
help
yourself
,
"
replied
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
think
of
your
going
and
attacking
me
,
that
have
always
been
a
friend
to
you
!
<EOS>
But
there
ca
n't
be
a
quarrel
without
two
parties
,
and
I
wo
n't
be
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
be
a
friend
to
you
,
in
spite
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
So
now
you
know
what
you
've
got
to
expect
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
necessity
of
carrying
on
this
dialogue
(
his
part
in
which
was
very
slow
;
mine
very
quick
)
in
a
low
tone
,
that
the
house
might
not
be
disturbed
at
an
unseasonable
hour
,
did
not
improve
my
temper
;
though
my
passion
was
cooling
down
.
 
<EOS>
Merely
telling
him
that
I
should
expect
from
him
what
I
always
had
expected
,
and
had
never
yet
been
disappointed
in
,
I
opened
the
door
upon
him
,
as
if
he
had
been
a
great
walnut
put
there
to
be
cracked
,
and
went
out
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
slept
out
of
the
house
too
,
at
his
mother
's
lodging
;
and
before
I
had
gone
many
hundred
yards
,
came
up
with
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
Copperfield
,
"
he
said
,
in
my
ear
(
I
did
not
turn
my
head
)
,
"
you
're
in
quite
a
wrong
position
"
;
which
I
felt
to
be
true
,
and
that
made
me
chafe
the
more
;
"
you
ca
n't
make
this
a
brave
thing
,
and
you
ca
n't
help
being
forgiven
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
intend
to
mention
it
to
mother
,
nor
to
any
living
soul
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
determined
to
forgive
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
do
wonder
that
you
should
lift
your
hand
against
a
person
that
you
knew
to
be
so
umble
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
felt
only
less
mean
than
he
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
me
better
than
I
knew
myself
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
retorted
or
openly
exasperated
me
,
it
would
have
been
a
relief
and
a
justification
;
but
he
had
put
me
on
a
slow
fire
,
on
which
I
lay
tormented
half
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
morning
,
when
I
came
out
,
the
early
church
-
bell
was
ringing
,
and
he
was
walking
up
and
down
with
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
He
addressed
me
as
if
nothing
had
happened
,
and
I
could
do
no
less
than
reply
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
struck
him
hard
enough
to
give
him
the
toothache
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
events
his
face
was
tied
up
in
a
black
silk
handkerchief
,
which
,
with
his
hat
perched
on
the
top
of
it
,
was
far
from
improving
his
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
that
he
went
to
a
dentist
's
in
London
on
the
Monday
morning
,
and
had
a
tooth
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
was
a
double
one
.
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
gave
out
that
he
was
not
quite
well
;
and
remained
alone
,
for
a
considerable
part
of
every
day
,
during
the
remainder
of
the
visit
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
and
her
father
had
been
gone
a
week
,
before
we
resumed
our
usual
work
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
day
preceding
its
resumption
,
the
Doctor
gave
me
with
his
own
hands
a
folded
note
not
sealed
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
addressed
to
myself
;
and
laid
an
injunction
on
me
,
in
a
few
affectionate
words
,
never
to
refer
to
the
subject
of
that
evening
.
<EOS>
I
had
confided
it
to
my
aunt
,
but
to
no
one
else
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
subject
I
could
discuss
with
Agnes
,
and
Agnes
certainly
had
not
the
least
suspicion
of
what
had
passed
.
   
<EOS>
Neither
,
I
felt
convinced
,
had
Mrs
Strong
then
.
 
<EOS>
Several
weeks
elapsed
before
I
saw
the
least
change
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
came
on
slowly
,
like
a
cloud
when
there
is
no
wind
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
she
seemed
to
wonder
at
the
gentle
compassion
with
which
the
Doctor
spoke
to
her
,
and
at
his
wish
that
she
should
have
her
mother
with
her
,
to
relieve
the
dull
monotony
of
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
Often
,
when
we
were
at
work
,
and
she
was
sitting
by
,
I
would
see
her
pausing
and
looking
at
him
with
that
memorable
face
.
 
<EOS>
Afterwards
,
I
sometimes
observed
her
rise
,
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
,
and
go
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Gradually
,
an
unhappy
shadow
fell
upon
her
beauty
,
and
deepened
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Markleham
was
a
regular
inmate
of
the
cottage
then
;
but
she
talked
and
talked
,
and
saw
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
As
this
change
stole
on
Annie
,
once
like
sunshine
in
the
Doctor
's
house
,
the
Doctor
became
older
in
appearance
,
and
more
grave
;
but
the
sweetness
of
his
temper
,
the
placid
kindness
of
his
manner
,
and
his
benevolent
solicitude
for
her
,
if
they
were
capable
of
any
increase
,
were
increased
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
him
once
,
early
on
the
morning
of
her
birthday
,
when
she
came
to
sit
in
the
window
while
we
were
at
work
(
which
she
had
always
done
,
but
now
began
to
do
with
a
timid
and
uncertain
air
that
I
thought
very
touching
)
,
take
her
forehead
between
his
hands
,
kiss
it
,
and
go
hurriedly
away
,
too
much
moved
to
remain
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
her
stand
where
he
had
left
her
,
like
a
statue
;
and
then
bend
down
her
head
,
and
clasp
her
hands
,
and
weep
,
I
can
not
say
how
sorrowfully
.
   
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
after
that
,
I
fancied
that
she
tried
to
speak
even
to
me
,
in
intervals
when
we
were
left
alone
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
never
uttered
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
The
Doctor
always
had
some
new
project
for
her
participating
in
amusements
away
from
home
,
with
her
mother
;
and
Mrs
Markleham
,
who
was
very
fond
of
amusements
,
and
very
easily
dissatisfied
with
anything
else
,
entered
into
them
with
great
good
-
will
,
and
was
loud
in
her
commendations
.
 
<EOS>
But
Annie
,
in
a
spiritless
unhappy
way
,
only
went
whither
she
was
led
,
and
seemed
to
have
no
care
for
anything
.
   
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
what
to
think
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
did
my
aunt
;
who
must
have
walked
,
at
various
times
,
a
hundred
miles
in
her
uncertainty
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
strangest
of
all
was
,
that
the
only
real
relief
which
seemed
to
make
its
way
into
the
secret
region
of
this
domestic
unhappiness
,
made
its
way
there
in
the
person
of
Mr
Dick
.
   
<EOS>
What
his
thoughts
were
on
the
subject
,
or
what
his
observation
was
,
I
am
as
unable
to
explain
,
as
I
dare
say
he
would
have
been
to
assist
me
in
the
task
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
have
recorded
in
the
narrative
of
my
school
days
,
his
veneration
for
the
Doctor
was
unbounded
;
and
there
is
a
subtlety
of
perception
in
real
attachment
,
even
when
it
is
borne
towards
man
by
one
of
the
lower
animals
,
which
leaves
the
highest
intellect
behind
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
mind
of
the
heart
,
if
I
may
call
it
so
,
in
Mr
Dick
,
some
bright
ray
of
the
truth
shot
straight
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
proudly
resumed
his
privilege
,
in
many
of
his
spare
hours
,
of
walking
up
and
down
the
garden
with
the
Doctor
;
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
pace
up
and
down
The
Doctor
's
Walk
at
Canterbury
.
<EOS>
But
matters
were
no
sooner
in
this
state
,
than
he
devoted
all
his
spare
time
(
and
got
up
earlier
to
make
it
more
)
to
these
perambulations
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
never
been
so
happy
as
when
the
Doctor
read
that
marvellous
performance
,
the
Dictionary
,
to
him
;
he
was
now
quite
miserable
unless
the
Doctor
pulled
it
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
began
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Doctor
and
I
were
engaged
,
he
now
fell
into
the
custom
of
walking
up
and
down
with
Mrs
Strong
,
and
helping
her
to
trim
her
favourite
flowers
,
or
weed
the
beds
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
rarely
spoke
a
dozen
words
in
an
hour
:
but
his
quiet
interest
,
and
his
wistful
face
,
found
immediate
response
in
both
their
breasts
<EOS>
;
each
knew
that
the
other
liked
him
,
and
that
he
loved
both
;
and
he
became
what
no
one
else
could
be
---
a
link
between
them
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
think
of
him
,
with
his
impenetrably
wise
face
,
walking
up
and
down
with
the
Doctor
,
delighted
to
be
battered
by
the
hard
words
in
the
Dictionary
;
when
I
think
of
him
carrying
huge
watering
-
pots
after
Annie
;
kneeling
down
,
in
very
paws
of
gloves
,
at
patient
microscopic
work
among
the
little
leaves
;
expressing
as
no
philosopher
could
have
expressed
,
in
everything
he
did
,
a
delicate
desire
to
be
her
friend
;
showering
sympathy
,
trustfulness
,
and
affection
,
out
of
every
hole
in
the
watering
-
pot
;
when
I
think
of
him
never
wandering
in
that
better
mind
of
his
to
which
unhappiness
addressed
itself
,
never
bringing
the
unfortunate
King
Charles
into
the
garden
,
never
wavering
in
his
grateful
service
,
never
diverted
from
his
knowledge
that
there
was
something
wrong
,
or
from
his
wish
to
set
it
right
<EOS>
---
I
really
feel
almost
ashamed
of
having
known
that
he
was
not
quite
in
his
wits
,
taking
account
of
the
utmost
I
have
done
with
mine
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nobody
but
myself
,
Trot
,
knows
what
that
man
is
!
"
<EOS>
my
aunt
would
proudly
remark
,
when
we
conversed
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dick
will
distinguish
himself
yet
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
must
refer
to
one
other
topic
before
I
close
this
chapter
.
 
<EOS>
While
the
visit
at
the
Doctor
's
was
still
in
progress
,
I
observed
that
the
postman
brought
two
or
three
letters
every
morning
for
Uriah
Heep
,
who
remained
at
Highgate
until
the
rest
went
back
,
it
being
a
leisure
time
;
and
that
these
were
always
directed
in
a
business
-
like
manner
by
Mr
Micawber
,
who
now
assumed
a
round
legal
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
glad
to
infer
,
from
these
slight
premises
,
that
Mr
Micawber
was
doing
well
;
and
consequently
was
much
surprised
to
receive
,
about
this
time
,
the
following
letter
from
his
amiable
wife
:
---
    
"
CANTERBURY
,
Monday
Evening
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
"
You
will
doubtless
be
surprised
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
to
receive
this
communication
.
 
<EOS>
Still
more
so
,
by
its
contents
.
 
<EOS>
Still
more
so
,
by
the
stipulation
of
implicit
confidence
which
I
beg
to
impose
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
feelings
as
a
wife
and
mother
require
relief
;
and
<EOS>
as
I
do
not
wish
to
consult
my
family
(
already
obnoxious
to
the
feelings
of
Mr
Micawber
)
,
I
know
no
one
of
whom
I
can
better
ask
advice
than
my
friend
and
former
lodger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
aware
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
that
between
myself
and
Mr
Micawber
(
whom
I
will
never
desert
)
,
there
has
always
been
preserved
a
spirit
of
mutual
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
may
have
occasionally
given
a
bill
without
consulting
me
,
or
he
may
have
misled
me
as
to
the
period
when
that
obligation
would
become
due
.
<EOS>
This
has
actually
happened
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
general
,
Mr
Micawber
has
had
no
secrets
from
the
bosom
of
affection
<EOS>
---
I
allude
to
his
wife
---
and
has
invariably
,
on
our
retirement
to
rest
,
recalled
the
events
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
will
picture
to
yourself
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
what
the
poignancy
of
my
feelings
must
be
,
when
I
inform
you
that
Mr
Micawber
is
entirely
changed
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
reserved
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
secret
.
 
<EOS>
His
life
is
a
mystery
to
the
partner
of
his
joys
and
sorrows
---
I
again
allude
to
his
wife
---
and
if
I
should
assure
you
that
beyond
knowing
that
it
is
passed
from
morning
to
night
at
the
office
,
I
now
know
less
of
it
than
I
do
of
the
man
in
the
south
,
connected
with
whose
mouth
the
thoughtless
children
repeat
an
idle
tale
respecting
cold
plum
porridge
,
I
should
adopt
a
popular
fallacy
to
express
an
actual
fact
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
this
is
not
all
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
is
morose
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
severe
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
estranged
from
our
eldest
son
and
daughter
,
he
has
no
pride
in
his
twins
,
he
looks
with
an
eye
of
coldness
even
on
the
unoffending
stranger
who
last
became
a
member
of
our
circle
.
 
<EOS>
The
pecuniary
means
of
meeting
our
expenses
,
kept
down
to
the
utmost
farthing
,
are
obtained
from
him
with
great
difficulty
,
and
even
under
fearful
threats
that
he
will
Settle
himself
(
the
exact
expression
)
;
and
he
inexorably
refuses
to
give
any
explanation
whatever
of
this
distracting
policy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
hard
to
bear
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
heart
-
breaking
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
will
advise
me
,
knowing
my
feeble
powers
such
as
they
are
,
how
you
think
it
will
be
best
to
exert
them
in
a
dilemma
so
unwonted
,
you
will
add
another
friendly
obligation
to
the
many
you
have
already
rendered
me
.
 
<EOS>
With
loves
from
the
children
,
and
a
smile
from
the
happily
-
unconscious
stranger
,
I
remain
,
<EOS>
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,

afflicted

I
did
not
feel
justified
in
giving
a
wife
of
Mrs
Micawber
's
experience
any
other
recommendation
,
than
that
she
should
try
to
reclaim
Mr
Micawber
by
patience
and
kindness
(
as
I
knew
she
would
in
any
case
)
;
but
the
letter
set
me
thinking
about
him
very
much
.

Chapter
43

<EOS>
Another
retrospect
 
Once
again
,
let
me
pause
upon
a
memorable
period
of
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
stand
aside
,
to
see
the
phantoms
of
those
days
go
by
me
,
accompanying
the
shadow
of
myself
,
in
dim
procession
.
   
<EOS>
Weeks
,
months
,
seasons
,
pass
along
.
 
<EOS>
They
seem
little
more
than
a
summer
day
and
a
winter
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
the
Common
where
I
walk
with
Dora
is
all
in
bloom
,
a
field
of
bright
gold
;
and
now
the
unseen
heather
lies
in
mounds
and
bunches
underneath
a
covering
of
snow
.
<EOS>
In
a
breath
,
the
river
that
flows
through
our
Sunday
walks
is
sparkling
in
the
summer
sun
,
is
ruffled
by
the
winter
wind

<EOS>
Faster
than
ever
river
ran
towards
the
sea

it
flashes

darkens

and
rolls
away

<EOS>
Not
a

changes

in
the
house
of
the

<EOS>
The
clock
ticks
over
the
fireplace
,
the
weather

glass
hangs
in
the
hall

<EOS>
Neither
clock
nor
weather

glass
is
ever
right
;
but
we
believe
in
both
,
devoutly

<EOS>
I
have
come
legally
to
man
's
estate
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
attained
the
dignity
of
twenty
-
one
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
is
a
sort
of
dignity
that
may
be
thrust
upon
one
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
think
what
I
have
achieved
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
tamed
that
savage
stenographic
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
a
respectable
income
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
in
high
repute
for
my
accomplishment
in
all
<EOS>
pertaining
to
the
art
,
and
am
joined
with
eleven
others
in
reporting
the
debates
in
Parliament
for
a
Morning
Newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
Night
after
night
,
I
record
predictions
that
never
come
to
pass
,
professions
that
are
never
fulfilled
,
explanations
that
are
only
meant
to
mystify
.
 
<EOS>
I
wallow
in
words
.
 
<EOS>
Britannia
,
that
unfortunate
female
,
is
always
before
me
,
like
a
trussed
fowl
:
skewered
through
and
through
with
office
-
pens
,
and
bound
hand
and
foot
with
red
tape
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sufficiently
behind
the
scenes
to
know
the
worth
of
political
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
an
Infidel
about
it
,
and
shall
never
be
converted
.
   
<EOS>
My
dear
old
Traddles
has
tried
his
hand
at
the
same
pursuit
,
but
it
is
not
in
Traddles
's
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
perfectly
good
-
humoured
respecting
his
failure
,
and
reminds
me
that
he
always
did
consider
himself
slow
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
occasional
employment
on
the
same
newspaper
,
in
getting
up
the
facts
of
dry
subjects
,
to
be
written
about
and
embellished
by
more
fertile
minds
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
called
to
the
bar
;
and
with
admirable
industry
and
self
-
denial
has
scraped
another
hundred
pounds
together
,
to
fee
a
Conveyancer
whose
chambers
he
attends
.
<EOS>
A
great
deal
of
very
hot
port
wine
was
consumed
at
his
call
;
and
,
considering
the
figure
,
I
should
think
the
Inner
Temple
must
have
made
a
profit
by
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
come
out
in
another
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
taken
with
fear
and
trembling
to
authorship
.
 
<EOS>
I
wrote
a
little
something
,
in
secret
,
and
sent
it
to
a
magazine
,
and
it
was
published
in
the
magazine
.
<EOS>
Since
then
,
I
have
taken
heart
to
write
a
good
many
trifling
pieces
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
am
regularly
paid
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
Altogether
,
I
am
well
off
,
when
I
tell
my
income
on
the
fingers
of
my
left
hand
,
I
pass
the
third
finger
and
take
in
the
fourth
to
the
middle
joint
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
removed
,
from
Buckingham
Street
,
to
a
pleasant
little
cottage
very
near
the
one
I
looked
at
,
when
my
enthusiasm
first
came
on
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
however
(
who
has
sold
the
house
at
Dover
,
to
good
advantage
)
,
is
not
going
to
remain
here
,
but
intends
removing
herself
to
a
still
more
tiny
cottage
close
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
What
does
this
portend
?
 
<EOS>
My
marriage
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
!
   
<EOS>
Yes
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
be
married
to
Dora
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
and
Miss
Clarissa
have
given
their
consent
;
and
if
ever
canary
birds
were
in
a
flutter
,
they
are
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
,
self
-
charged
with
the
superintendence
of
my
darling
's
wardrobe
,
is
constantly
cutting
out
brown
-
paper
cuirasses
,
and
differing
in
opinion
from
a
highly
respectable
young
man
,
with
a
long
bundle
,
and
a
yard
measure
under
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
A
dressmaker
,
always
stabbed
in
the
breast
with
a
needle
and
thread
,
boards
and
lodges
in
the
house
;
and
seems
to
me
,
eating
,
drinking
,
or
sleeping
,
never
to
take
her
thimble
off
.
 
<EOS>
They
make
a
lay
-
figure
of
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
always
sending
for
her
to
come
and
try
something
on
.
 
<EOS>
We
ca
n't
be
happy
together
for
five
minutes
in
the
evening
,
but
some
intrusive
female
knocks
at
the
door
,
and
says
,
"
Oh
,
if
you
please
,
Miss
Dora
,
would
you
step
upstairs
!
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Clarissa
and
my
aunt
roam
all
over
London
,
to
find
out
articles
of
furniture
for
Dora
and
me
to
look
at
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
better
for
them
to
buy
the
goods
at
once
,
without
this
ceremony
of
inspection
;
for
,
when
we
go
to
see
a
kitchen
fender
and
meat
-
screen
,
Dora
sees
a
Chinese
house
for
Jip
,
with
little
bells
on
the
top
,
and
prefers
that
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
takes
a
long
time
to
accustom
Jip
to
his
new
residence
,
after
we
have
bought
it
;
whenever
he
goes
in
or
out
,
he
makes
all
the
little
bells
ring
,
and
is
horribly
frightened
.
   
<EOS>
Peggotty
comes
up
to
make
herself
useful
,
and
falls
to
work
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
Her
department
appears
to
be
,
to
clean
everything
over
and
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
rubs
everything
that
can
be
rubbed
,
until
it
shines
,
like
her
own
honest
forehead
,
with
perpetual
friction
.
<EOS>
And
now
it
is
,
that
I
begin
to
see
her
solitary
brother
passing
through
the
dark
streets
at
night
,
and
looking
,
as
he
goes
,
among
the
wandering
faces
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
speak
to
him
at
such
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
too
well
,
as
his
grave
figure
passes
onward
,
what
he
seeks
,
and
what
he
dreads
.
   
<EOS>
Why
does
Traddles
look
so
important
when
he
calls
upon
me
this
afternoon
in
the
Commons
---
where
I
still
occasionally
attend
,
for
form
's
sake
,
when
I
have
time
?
 
<EOS>
The
realization
of
my
boyish
day
-
dreams
is
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
take
out
the
licence
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
a
little
document
to
do
so
much
;
and
Traddles
contemplates
it
,
as
it
lies
upon
my
desk
,
half
in
admiration
,
half
in
awe
.
<EOS>
There
are
the
names
,
in
the
sweet
old
visionary
connexion
,
David
Copperfield
and
Dora
Spenlow
;
and
there
,
in
the
corner
,
is
that
Parental
Institution
,
the
Stamp
Office
,
which
is
so
benignantly
interested
in
the
various
transactions
of
human
life
,
looking
down
upon
our
Union
;
and
there
is
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
invoking
a
blessing
on
us
in
print
,
and
doing
it
as
cheap
as
could
possibly
be
expected
.
   
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
am
in
a
dream
,
a
flustered
,
happy
,
hurried
dream
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
believe
that
it
is
going
to
be
;
and
yet
I
ca
n't
believe
but
that
everyone
I
pass
in
the
street
,
must
have
some
kind
of
perception
,
that
I
am
to
be
married
the
day
after
tomorrow
.
 
<EOS>
The
Surrogate
knows
me
,
when
I
go
down
to
be
sworn
;
and
disposes
of
me
easily
,
as
if
there
were
a
Masonic
understanding
between
us
.
<EOS>
Traddles
is
not
at
all
wanted
,
but
is
in
attendance
as
my
general
backer
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
the
next
time
you
come
here
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
I
say
to
Traddles
,
"
it
will
be
on
the
same
errand
for
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
hope
it
will
be
soon
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
for
your
good
wishes
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
"
he
replies
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
too
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
satisfaction
to
know
that
she
'll
wait
for
me
any
length
of
time
,
and
that
she
really
is
the
dearest
girl
---
"
   
"
When
are
you
to
meet
her
at
the
coach
?
"
I
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
seven
,
"
says
Traddles
,
looking
at
his
plain
old
silver
watch
---
<EOS>
the
very
watch
he
once
took
a
wheel
out
of
,
at
school
,
to
make
a
water
-
mill
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
about
Miss
Wickfield
's
time
,
is
it
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
little
earlier
.
 
<EOS>
Her
time
is
half
past
eight
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
my
dear
boy
,
"
says
Traddles
,
"
I
am
almost
as
pleased
as
if
I
were
going
to
be
married
myself
,
to
think
that
this
event
is
coming
to
such
a
happy
termination
.
 
<EOS>
And
really
the
great
friendship
and
consideration
of
personally
associating
Sophy
with
the
joyful
occasion
,
and
inviting
her
to
be
a
bridesmaid
in
conjunction
with
Miss
Wickfield
,
demands
my
warmest
thanks
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
extremely
sensible
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
hear
him
,
and
shake
hands
with
him
;
and
we
talk
,
and
walk
,
and
dine
,
and
so
on
;
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
is
real
.
   
<EOS>
Sophy
arrives
at
the
house
of
Dora
's
aunts
,
in
due
course
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
the
most
agreeable
of
faces
,
---
not
absolutely
beautiful
,
but
extraordinarily
pleasant
,
---
and
is
one
of
the
most
genial
,
unaffected
,
frank
,
engaging
creatures
I
have
ever
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
presents
her
to
us
with
great
pride
;
and
rubs
his
hands
for
ten
minutes
by
the
clock
,
with
every
individual
hair
upon
his
head
standing
on
tiptoe
,
when
I
congratulate
him
in
a
corner
on
his
choice
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
brought
Agnes
from
the
Canterbury
coach
,
and
her
cheerful
and
beautiful
face
is
among
us
for
the
second
time
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
has
a
great
liking
for
Traddles
,
and
it
is
capital
to
see
them
meet
,
and
to
observe
the
glory
of
Traddles
as
he
commends
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
to
her
acquaintance
.
   
<EOS>
Still
I
do
n't
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
delightful
evening
,
and
are
supremely
happy
;
but
I
do
n't
believe
it
yet
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
collect
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
check
off
my
happiness
as
it
takes
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
in
a
misty
and
unsettled
kind
of
state
;
as
if
I
had
got
up
very
early
in
the
morning
a
week
or
two
ago
,
and
had
never
been
to
bed
since
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
make
out
when
yesterday
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
seem
to
have
been
carrying
the
licence
about
,
in
my
pocket
,
many
months
.
   
<EOS>
Next
day
,
too
,
when
we
all
go
in
a
flock
to
see
the
house
---
our
house
---
Dora
's
and
mine
---
I
am
quite
unable
to
regard
myself
as
its
master
.
 
<EOS>
I
seem
to
be
there
,
by
permission
of
somebody
else
.
 
<EOS>
I
half
expect
the
real
master
to
come
home
presently
,
and
say
he
is
glad
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
beautiful
little
house
as
it
is
,
with
everything
so
bright
and
new
;
with
the
flowers
on
the
carpets
looking
as
if
freshly
gathered
,
and
the
green
leaves
on
the
paper
as
if
they
had
just
come
out
;
with
the
spotless
muslin
curtains
,
and
<EOS>
the
blushing
rose
-
coloured
furniture
,
and
Dora
's
garden
hat
with
the
blue
ribbon
<EOS>
---
do
I
remember
,
now
,
how
I
loved
her
in
such
another
hat
when
I
first
knew
her
!
---
already
hanging
on
its
little
peg
;
the
guitar
-
case
quite
at
home
on
its
heels
in
a
corner
;
and
everybody
tumbling
over
Jip
's
pagoda
,
which
is
much
too
big
for
the
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
Another
happy
evening
,
quite
as
unreal
as
all
the
rest
of
it
,
and
I
steal
into
the
usual
room
before
going
away
.
<EOS>
Dora
is
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
have
not
done
trying
on
yet
.
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
peeps
in
,
and
tells
me
mysteriously
that
she
will
not
be
long
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
rather
long
,
notwithstanding
;
but
by
and
by
I
hear
a
rustling
at
the
door
,
and
someone
taps
.
   
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
Come
in
!
"
<EOS>
but
someone
taps
again
.
   
<EOS>
I
go
to
the
door
,
wondering
who
it
is
;
there
,
I
meet
a
pair
of
bright
eyes
,
and
a
blushing
face
;
they
are
Dora
's
eyes
and
face
,
and
Miss
Lavinia
has
dressed
her
in
tomorrow
's
dress
,
bonnet
and
all
,
for
me
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
my
little
wife
to
my
heart
;
and
Miss
Lavinia
gives
a
little
scream
because
I
tumble
the
bonnet
,
and
Dora
laughs
and
cries
at
once
,
because
I
am
so
pleased
;
and
I
believe
it
less
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
it
pretty
,
Doady
?
"
says
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
Pretty
!
 
<EOS>
I
should
rather
think
I
did
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
are
you
sure
you
like
me
very
much
?
"
says
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
The
topic
is
fraught
with
such
danger
to
the
bonnet
,
that
Miss
Lavinia
gives
another
little
scream
,
and
begs
me
to
understand
that
Dora
is
only
to
be
looked
at
,
and
on
no
account
to
be
touched
.
 
<EOS>
So
Dora
stands
in
a
delightful
state
of
confusion
for
a
minute
or
two
,
to
be
admired
;
and
then
takes
off
her
bonnet
---
looking
so
natural
without
it
!
<EOS>
---
and
runs
away
with
it
in
her
hand
;
and
comes
dancing
down
again
in
her
own
familiar
dress
,
and
asks
Jip
if
I
have
got
a
beautiful
little
wife
,
and
whether
he
'll
forgive
her
for
being
married
,
and
kneels
down
to
make
him
stand
upon
the
cookery
-
book
,
for
the
last
time
in
her
single
life
.
   
<EOS>
I
go
home
,
more
incredulous
than
ever
,
to
a
lodging
that
I
have
hard
by
;
and
get
up
very
early
in
the
morning
,
to
ride
to
the
Highgate
road
and
fetch
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
never
seen
my
aunt
in
such
state
.
 
<EOS>
She

dressed

lavender

coloured
silk

bonnet
on

is
amazing

<EOS>
Janet
has
dressed
her
,
and
is
there
to
look
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
is
ready
to
go
to
church
,
intending
to
behold
the
ceremony
from
the
gallery
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
,
who
is
to
give
my
darling
to
me
at
the
altar
,
has
had
his
hair
curled
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
,
whom
I
have
taken
up
by
appointment
at
the
turnpike
,
presents
a
dazzling
combination
of
cream
colour
and
light
blue
;
and
both
he
and
Mr
Dick
have
a
general
effect
about
them
of
being
all
gloves
.
   
<EOS>
No
doubt
I
see
this
,
because
I
know
it
is
so
;
but
I
am
astray
,
and
seem
to
see
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
do
I
believe
anything
<EOS>
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
as
we
drive
along
in
an
open
carriage
,
this
fairy
marriage
is
real
enough
to
fill
me
with
a
sort
of
wondering
pity
for
the
unfortunate
people
who
have
no
part
in
it
,
but
are
sweeping
out
the
shops
,
and
going
to
their
daily
occupations
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
sits
with
my
hand
in
hers
all
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
stop
a
little
way
short
of
the
church
,
to
put
down
Peggotty
,
whom
we
have
brought
on
the
box
,
she
gives
it
a
squeeze
,
and
me
a
kiss
.
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
Trot
!
 
<EOS>
My
own
boy
never
could
be
dearer
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
of
poor
dear
Baby
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
do
I.
 
<EOS>
And
of
all
I
owe
to
you
,
dear
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Tut
,
child
!
"
says
my
aunt
;
and
gives
her
hand
in
overflowing
cordiality
to
Traddles
,
who
then
gives
his
to
Mr
Dick
,
who
then
gives
his
to
me
,
who
then
gives
mine
to
Traddles
,
and
then
we
come
to
the
church
door
.
   
<EOS>
The
church
is
calm
enough
,
I
am
sure
;
but
it
might
be
a
steam
-
power
loom
in
full
action
,
for
any
sedative
effect
it
has
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
too
far
gone
for
that
.
   
<EOS>
The
rest
is
all
a
more
or
less
incoherent
dream
.
   
<EOS>
A
dream
of
their
coming
in
with
Dora
;
of
the
pew
-
opener
arranging
us
,
like
a
drill
-
sergeant
,
before
the
altar
rails
;
of
my
wondering
,
even
then
,
why
pew
-
openers
must
always
be
the
most
disagreeable
females
procurable
,
and
whether
there
is
any
religious
dread
of
a
disastrous
infection
of
good
-
humour
which
renders
it
indispensable
to
set
those
vessels
of
vinegar
upon
the
road
to
Heaven
.
   
<EOS>
Of
the
clergyman
and
clerk
appearing
;
of
a
few
boatmen
and
some
other
people
strolling
in
;
of
an
ancient
mariner
behind
me
,
strongly
flavouring
the
church
with
rum
;
of
the
service
beginning
in
a
deep
voice
,
and
our
all
being
very
attentive
.
   
<EOS>
Of
Miss
Lavinia
,
who
acts
as
a
semi
-
auxiliary
<EOS>
bridesmaid
,
being
the
first
to
cry
,
and
of
her
doing
homage
(
<EOS>
as
I
take
it
)
to
the
memory
of
Pidger
,
in
sobs
;
of
Miss
Clarissa
applying
a
smelling
-
bottle
;
of
Agnes
taking
care
of
Dora
;
of
my
aunt
endeavouring
to
represent
herself
as
a
model
of
sternness
,
with
tears
rolling
down
her
face
;
of
little
Dora
trembling
very
much
,
and
making
her
responses
in
faint
whispers
.
   
<EOS>
Of
our
kneeling
down
together
,
side
by
side
;
of
Dora
's
trembling
less
and
less
,
but
always
clasping
Agnes
by
the
hand
;
of
the
service
being
got
through
,
quietly
and
gravely
;
of
our
all
looking
at
each
other
in
an
April
state
of
smiles
and
tears
,
when
it
is
over
;
of
my
young
wife
being
hysterical
in
the
vestry
,
and
crying
for
her
poor
papa
,
her
dear
papa
.
   
<EOS>
Of
her
soon
cheering
up
again
,
and
our
signing
the
register
all
round
.
 
<EOS>
Of
my
going
into
the
gallery
for
Peggotty
to
bring
her
to
sign
it
;
of
Peggotty
's
hugging
me
in
a
corner
,
and
telling
me
she
saw
my
own
dear
mother
married
;
of
its
being
over
,
and
our
going
away
.
   
<EOS>
Of
my
walking
so
proudly
and
lovingly
down
the
aisle
with
my
sweet
wife
upon
my
arm
,
through
a
mist
of
half
-
seen
people
,
pulpits
,
monuments
,
pews
,
fonts
,
organs
,
and
church
windows
,
in
which
there
flutter
faint
airs
of
association
with
my
childish
church
at
home
,
so
long
ago
.
   
<EOS>
Of
their
whispering
,
as
we
pass
,
what
a
youthful
couple
we
are
,
and
what
a
pretty
little
wife
she
is
.
 
<EOS>
Of
our
all
being
so
merry
and
talkative
in
the
carriage
going
back
.
 
<EOS>
Of
Sophy
telling
us
that
when
she
saw
Traddles
(
whom
I
had
entrusted
with
the
licence
)
asked
for
it
,
she
almost
fainted
,
having
been
convinced
that
he
would
contrive
to
lose
it
,
or
to
have
his
pocket
picked
.
 
<EOS>
Of
Agnes
<EOS>
laughing
gaily
;
and
of
Dora
being
so
fond
of
Agnes
that
she
will
not
be
separated
from
her
,
but
still
keeps
her
hand
.
   
<EOS>
Of
there
being
a
breakfast
,
with
abundance
of
things
,
pretty
and
substantial
,
to
eat
and
drink
,
whereof
I
partake
,
as
I
should
do
in
any
other
dream
,
without
the
least
perception
of
their
flavour
;
eating
and
drinking
,
as
I
may
say
,
nothing
but
love
and
marriage
,
and
no
more
believing
in
the
viands
than
in
anything
else
.
   
<EOS>
Of
my
making
a
speech
in
the
same
dreamy
fashion
,
without
having
an
idea
of
what
I
want
to
say
,
beyond
such
as
may
be
comprehended
in
the
full
conviction
that
I
have
n't
said
it
.
 
<EOS>
Of
our
being
very
sociably
and
simply
happy
(
always
in
a
dream
though
)
;
and
of
Jip
's
having
wedding
cake
,
and
its
not
agreeing
with
him
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
Of
the
pair
of
hired
post
-
horses
being
ready
,
and
of
Dora
's
going
away
to
change
her
dress
.
 
<EOS>
Of
my
aunt
and
Miss
Clarissa
remaining
with
us
;
and
our
walking
in
the
garden
;
and
my
aunt
,
who
has
made
quite
a
speech
at
breakfast
touching
Dora
's
aunts
,
being
mightily
amused
with
herself
,
but
a
little
proud
of
it
too
.
   
<EOS>
Of
Dora
's
being
ready
,
and
of
Miss
Lavinia
's
hovering
about
her
,
loth
to
lose
the
pretty
toy
that
has
given
her
so
much
pleasant
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
Of
<EOS>
Dora
's
making
a
long
series
of
surprised
discoveries
that
she
has
forgotten
all
sorts
of
little
things
;
and
of
everybody
's
running
everywhere
to
fetch
them
.
   
<EOS>
Of
their
all
closing
about
Dora
,
when
at
last
she
begins
to
say
good
-
bye
,
looking
,
with
their
bright
colours
and
ribbons
,
like
a
bed
of
flowers
.
 
<EOS>
Of
my
darling
being
almost
smothered
among
the
flowers
,
and
coming
out
,
laughing
and
crying
both
together
,
to
my
jealous
arms
.
   
<EOS>
Of
my
wanting
to
carry
Jip
(
who
is
to
go
along
with
us
)
,
and
Dora
's
saying
no
,
that
she
must
carry
him
,
or
else
he
'll
think
she
do
n't
like
him
any
more
,
now
she
is
married
,
and
will
break
his
heart
.
<EOS>
Of
our
going
,
arm
in
arm
,
and
Dora
stopping
and
looking
back
,
and
saying
,
"
If
I
have
ever
been
cross
or
ungrateful
to
anybody
,
do
n't
remember
it
!
"
and
bursting
into
tears
.
   
<EOS>
Of
her
waving
her
little
hand
,
and
our
going
away
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
Of
her
once
more
stopping
,
and
looking
back
,
and
hurrying
to
Agnes
,
and
giving
Agnes
,
above
all
the
others
,
her
last
kisses
and
farewells
.
   
<EOS>
We
drive
away
together
,
and
I
awake
from
the
dream
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
it
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
my
dear
,
dear
,
little
wife
beside
me
,
whom
I
love
so
well
!
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
happy
now
,
you
foolish
boy
?
"
says
Dora
,
"
and
sure
you
do
n't
repent
?
"
   
I
have
stood
aside
to
see
the
phantoms
of
those
days
go
by
me
.
<EOS>
They
are
gone
,
and
I
resume
the
journey
of
my
story
.
      
<EOS>
Chapter
44
.
<EOS>
Our
housekeeping
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
strange
condition
of
things
,
the
honeymoon
being
over
,
and
the
bridesmaids
gone
home
,
when
I
found
myself
sitting
down
in
my
own
small
house
with
Dora
;
quite
thrown
out
of
employment
,
as
I
may
say
,
in
respect
of
the
delicious
old
occupation
of
making
love
.
   
<EOS>
It
seemed
such
an
extraordinary
thing
to
have
Dora
always
there
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
unaccountable
not
to
be
obliged
to
go
out
to
see
her
,
not
to
have
any
occasion
to
be
tormenting
myself
about
her
,
not
to
have
to
write
to
her
,
not
to
be
scheming
and
devising
opportunities
of
being
alone
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
of
an
evening
,
when
I
looked
up
from
my
writing
,
and
saw
her
seated
opposite
,
I
would
lean
back
in
my
chair
,
and
think
how
queer
it
was
that
there
we
were
,
alone
together
as
a
matter
of
course
---
<EOS>
nobody
's
business
any
more
<EOS>
---
all
the
romance
of
our
engagement
put
away
upon
a
shelf
,
to
rust
---
<EOS>
no
one
to
please
but
one
another
---
one
another
to
please
,
for
life
.
   
<EOS>
When
there
was
a
debate
,
and
I
was
kept
out
very
late
,
it
seemed
so
strange
to
me
,
as
I
was
walking
home
,
to
think
that
Dora
was
at
home
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
such
a
wonderful
thing
,
at
first
,
to
have
her
coming
softly
down
to
talk
to
me
as
I
ate
my
supper
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
such
a
stupendous
thing
to
know
for
certain
that
she
put
her
hair
in
papers
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
altogether
such
an
astonishing
event
to
see
her
do
it
!
   
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
two
young
birds
could
have
known
less
about
keeping
house
,
than
I
and
my
pretty
Dora
did
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
a
servant
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
She
kept
house
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
still
a
latent
belief
that
she
must
have
been
Mrs
Crupp
's
daughter
in
disguise
,
we
had
such
an
awful
time
of
it
with
Mary
Anne
.
   
<EOS>
Her
name
was
Paragon
.
 
<EOS>
Her
nature
was
represented
to
us
,
when
we
engaged
her
,
as
being
feebly
expressed
in
her
name
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
a
written
character
,
as
large
as
a
proclamation
;
and
,
according
to
this
document
,
could
do
everything
of
a
domestic
nature
that
ever
I
heard
of
,
and
a
great
many
things
that
I
never
did
hear
of
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
woman
in
the
prime
of
life
;
of
a
severe
countenance
;
and
subject
(
particularly
in
the
arms
)
to
a
sort
of
perpetual
measles
or
fiery
rash
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
a
cousin
in
the
Life
-
Guards
,
with
such
long
legs
that
he
looked
like
the
afternoon
shadow
of
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
His
shell
-
jacket
was
as
much
too
little
for
him
as
he
was
too
big
for
the
premises
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
the
cottage
smaller
than
it
need
<EOS>
have
been
,
by
being
so
very
much
out
of
proportion
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
which
,
the
walls
were
not
thick
,
and
,
whenever
he
passed
the
evening
at
our
house
,
we
always
knew
of
it
by
hearing
one
continual
growl
in
the
kitchen
.
   
<EOS>
Our
treasure
was
warranted
sober
and
honest
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
therefore
willing
to
believe
that
she
was
in
a
fit
when
we
found
her
under
the
boiler
;
and
that
the
deficient
tea
-
spoons
were
attributable
to
the
dustman
.
   
<EOS>
But
she
preyed
upon
our
minds
dreadfully
.
 
<EOS>
We
felt
our
inexperience
,
and
were
unable
to
help
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
We
should
have
been
at
her
mercy
,
if
she
had
had
any
;
but
she
was
a
remorseless
woman
,
and
had
none
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
the
cause
of
our
first
little
quarrel
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dearest
life
,
"
I
said
one
day
to
Dora
,
"
do
you
think
Mary
Anne
has
any
idea
of
time
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Doady
?
"
inquired
Dora
,
looking
up
,
innocently
,
from
her
drawing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
love
,
because
it
's
five
,
and
we
were
to
have
dined
at
four
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Dora
glanced
wistfully
at
the
clock
,
and
hinted
that
she
thought
it
was
too
fast
.
   
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
my
love
,
"
said
I
,
referring
to
my
watch
,
"
it
's
a
few
minutes
too
slow
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
little
wife
came
and
sat
upon
my
knee
,
to
coax
me
to
be
quiet
,
and
drew
a
line
with
her
pencil
down
the
middle
of
my
nose
;
but
I
could
n't
dine
off
that
,
though
it
was
very
agreeable
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
think
,
my
dear
,
"
said
I
,
"
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
remonstrate
with
Mary
Anne
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
please
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
,
Doady
!
"
said
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
,
my
love
?
<EOS>
"
I
gently
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
because
I
am
such
a
little
goose
,
"
said
Dora
,
"
and
she
knows
I
am
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
thought
this
sentiment
so
incompatible
with
the
establishment
of
any
system
of
check
on
Mary
Anne
,
that
I
frowned
a
little
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
ugly
wrinkles
in
my
bad
boy
's
forehead
!
"
said
Dora
,
and
still
being
on
my
knee
,
she
traced
them
with
her
pencil
;
putting
it
to
her
rosy
lips
to
make
it
mark
blacker
,
and
working
at
my
forehead
with
a
quaint
little
mockery
of
being
industrious
,
that
quite
delighted
me
in
spite
of
myself
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
good
child
,
"
said
Dora
,
"
it
makes
its
face
so
much
prettier
to
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
love
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
!
please
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dora
,
with
a
kiss
,
"
do
n't
be
a
naughty
Blue
Beard
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
serious
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
my
precious
wife
,
"
said
I
,
"
we
must
be
serious
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
Sit
down
on
this
chair
,
close
beside
me
!
 
<EOS>
Give
me
the
pencil
!
<EOS>
There
!
 
<EOS>
Now
let
us
talk
sensibly
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
,
dear
"
;
what
a
little
hand
it
was
to
hold
,
and
what
a
tiny
wedding
-
ring
it
was
to
see
!
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
my
love
,
it
is
not
exactly
comfortable
to
have
to
go
out
without
one
's
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
N
-
n
-
no
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Dora
,
faintly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
love
,
how
you
tremble
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
I
KNOW
you
're
going
to
scold
me
,
"
exclaimed
Dora
,
in
a
piteous
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
sweet
,
I
am
only
going
to
reason
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
reasoning
is
worse
than
scolding
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Dora
,
in
despair
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
marry
to
be
reasoned
with
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
meant
to
reason
with
such
a
poor
little
thing
as
I
am
,
you
ought
to
have
told
me
so
,
you
cruel
boy
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
tried
to
pacify
Dora
,
but
she
turned
away
her
face
,
and
shook
her
curls
from
side
to
side
,
and
said
,
"
You
cruel
,
cruel
boy
!
"
<EOS>
so
many
times
,
that
I
really
did
not
exactly
know
what
to
do
:
so
I
took
a
few
turns
up
and
down
the
room
in
my
uncertainty
,
and
came
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dora
,
my
darling
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
am
not
your
darling
.
 
<EOS>
Because
you
must
be
sorry
that
you
married
me
,
or
else
you
would
n't
reason
with
me
!
"
returned
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
I
felt
so
injured
by
the
inconsequential
nature
of
this
charge
,
that
it
gave
me
courage
to
be
grave
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
own
Dora
,
"
said
I
,
"
you
are
very
childish
,
and
are
talking
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
remember
,
I
am
sure
,
that
I
was
obliged
to
go
out
yesterday
when
dinner
was
half
over
;
and
that
,
the
day
before
,
I
was
made
quite
unwell
by
being
obliged
to
eat
underdone
veal
in
a
hurry
;
today
,
I
do
n't
dine
at
all
---
and
I
am
afraid
to
say
how
long
we
waited
for
breakfast
---
and
then
the
water
did
n't
boil
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
to
reproach
you
,
my
dear
,
but
this
is
not
comfortable
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
cruel
,
cruel
boy
,
to
say
I
am
a
disagreeable
wife
!
"
cried
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
dear
Dora
,
you
must
know
that
I
never
said
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
said
,
I
was
n't
comfortable
!
"
cried
Dora
.
<EOS>
"
I
said
the
housekeeping
was
not
comfortable
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
exactly
the
same
thing
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
evidently
thought
so
,
for
she
wept
most
grievously
.
   
<EOS>
I
took
another
turn
across
the
room
,
full
of
love
for
my
pretty
wife
,
and
distracted
by
self
-
accusatory
inclinations
to
knock
my
head
against
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
down
again
,
and
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
blaming
you
,
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
both
a
great
deal
to
learn
.
<EOS>
I
am
only
trying
to
show
you
,
my
dear
,
that
you
must
---
<EOS>
you
really
must
"
<EOS>
(
I
was
resolved
not
to
give
this
up
)
<EOS>
---
"
accustom
yourself
to
look
after
Mary
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
Likewise
to
act
a
little
for
yourself
,
and
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
,
I
do
,
at
your
making
such
ungrateful
speeches
,
"
sobbed
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
you
know
that
the
other
day
,
when
you
said
you
would
like
a
little
bit
of
fish
,
I
went
out
myself
,
miles
and
miles
,
and
ordered
it
,
to
surprise
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
it
was
very
kind
of
you
,
my
own
darling
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
felt
it
so
much
that
I
would
n't
on
any
account
have
even
mentioned
that
you
bought
a
Salmon
---
which
was
too
much
for
two
.
 
<EOS>
Or
that
it
cost
one
pound
six
---
<EOS>
which
was
more
than
we
can
afford
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
enjoyed
it
very
much
,
"
sobbed
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
said
I
was
a
Mouse
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
'll
say
so
again
,
my
love
,
"
I
returned
,
"
a
thousand
times
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
I
had
wounded
Dora
's
soft
little
heart
,
and
she
was
not
to
be
comforted
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
so
pathetic
in
her
sobbing
and
bewailing
,
that
I
felt
as
if
I
had
said
I
do
n't
know
what
to
hurt
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
hurry
away
;
I
was
kept
out
late
;
and
I
felt
all
night
such
pangs
of
remorse
as
made
me
miserable
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
the
conscience
of
an
assassin
,
and
was
haunted
by
a
vague
sense
of
enormous
wickedness
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
two
or
three
hours
past
midnight
when
I
got
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
my
aunt
,
in
our
house
,
sitting
up
for
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
anything
the
matter
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
alarmed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
Trot
,
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Blossom
has
been
rather
out
of
spirits
,
and
I
have
been
keeping
her
company
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
leaned
my
head
upon
my
hand
;
and
felt
more
sorry
and
downcast
,
as
I
sat
looking
at
the
fire
,
than
I
could
have
supposed
possible
so
soon
after
the
fulfilment
of
my
brightest
hopes
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
sat
thinking
,
I
happened
to
meet
my
aunt
's
eyes
,
which
were
resting
on
my
face
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
anxious
expression
in
them
,
but
it
cleared
directly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
aunt
,
"
said
I
,
"
I
have
been
quite
unhappy
myself
all
night
,
to
think
of
Dora
's
being
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
had
no
other
intention
than
to
speak
to
her
tenderly
and
lovingly
about
our
home
-
affairs
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
MY
aunt
nodded
encouragement
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
patience
,
Trot
,
"
said
she
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
knows
I
do
n't
mean
to
be
unreasonable
,
aunt
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
Little
Blossom
is
a
very
tender
little
blossom
,
and
the
wind
must
be
gentle
with
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
thanked
my
good
aunt
,
in
my
heart
,
for
her
tenderness
towards
my
wife
;
and
I
was
sure
that
she
knew
I
did
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
think
,
aunt
,
"
said
I
,
after
some
further
contemplation
of
the
fire
,
"
that
you
could
advise
and
counsel
Dora
<EOS>
a
little
,
for
our
mutual
advantage
,
<EOS>
now
and
then
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Trot
,
"
returned
my
aunt
,
with
some
emotion
,
"
no
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
ask
me
such
a
thing
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
tone
was
so
very
earnest
that
I
raised
my
eyes
in
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
look
back
on
my
life
,
child
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
and
I
think
of
some
who
are
in
their
graves
,
with
whom
I
might
have
been
on
kinder
terms
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
judged
harshly
of
other
people
's
mistakes
in
marriage
,
it
may
have
been
because
I
had
bitter
reason
to
judge
harshly
of
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
Let
that
pass
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
a
grumpy
,
frumpy
,
wayward
sort
of
a
woman
,
a
good
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
still
,
and
I
always
shall
be
.
<EOS>
But
you
and
I
have
done
one
another
some
good
,
Trot
,
---
at
all
events
,
you
have
done
me
good
,
my
dear
;
and
division
must
not
come
between
us
,
at
this
time
of
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Division
between
us
!
"
<EOS>
cried
I.
   
"
Child
,
child
!
"
<EOS>
said
my
aunt
,
smoothing
her
dress
,
"
how
soon
it
might
come
between
us
,
or
how
unhappy
I
might
make
our
Little
Blossom
<EOS>
,
if
I
meddled
in
anything
,
a
prophet
could
n't
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
our
pet
to
like
me
,
and
be
as
gay
as
a
butterfly
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
your
own
home
,
in
that
second
marriage
;
and
never
do
both
me
and
her
<EOS>
the
injury
you
have
hinted
at
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
comprehended
,
at
once
,
that
my
aunt
was
right
;
and
I
comprehended
the
full
extent
of
her
generous
feeling
towards
my
dear
wife
.
   
<EOS>
"
These
are
early
days
,
Trot
,
"
she
pursued
,
"
and
Rome
was
not
built
in
a
day
,
nor
in
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
chosen
freely
for
yourself
"
;
a
cloud
passed
over
her
face
for
a
moment
,
I
thought
;
"
and
you
have
chosen
a
very
pretty
and
a
very
affectionate
creature
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
your
duty
,
and
it
will
be
your
pleasure
too
---
<EOS>
of
course
I
know
that
;
I
am
not
delivering
a
lecture
---
to
estimate
her
(
as
you
chose
her
)
by
the
qualities
she
has
,
and
not
by
the
qualities
she
may
not
have
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
you
must
develop
in
her
,
if
you
can
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
you
can
not
,
child
,
"
here
my
aunt
rubbed
her
nose
,
"
you
must
just
accustom
yourself
to
do
without
'em
.
 
<EOS>
But
remember
,
my
dear
,
your
future
is
between
you
two
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
can
assist
you
;
you
are
to
work
it
out
for
yourselves
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
marriage
,
Trot
;
and
Heaven
bless
you
both
,
in
it
,
for
a
pair
of
babes
in
the
wood
as
you
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
said
this
in
a
sprightly
way
,
and
gave
me
a
kiss
to
ratify
the
blessing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
she
,
"
light
my
little
lantern
,
and
see
me
into
my
bandbox
by
the
garden
path
"
;
for
there
was
a
communication
between
our
cottages
in
that
direction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
Betsey
Trotwood
's
love
to
Blossom
,
when
you
come
back
;
and
whatever
you
do
<EOS>
,
Trot
,
never
dream
of
setting
Betsey
up
as
a
scarecrow
,
for
if
I
ever
saw
her
in
the
glass
,
she
's
quite
grim
enough
and
gaunt
enough
in
her
private
capacity
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
my
aunt
tied
her
head
up
in
a
handkerchief
,
with
which
she
was
accustomed
to
make
a
bundle
of
it
on
such
occasions
;
and
I
escorted
her
home
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
stood
in
her
garden
,
holding
up
her
little
lantern
to
light
me
back
,
I
thought
her
observation
of
me
had
an
anxious
air
again
;
but
I
was
too
much
occupied
in
pondering
on
what
she
had
said
,
and
too
much
impressed
---
for
the
first
time
,
in
reality
---
by
the
conviction
that
Dora
and
I
had
indeed
to
work
out
our
future
for
ourselves
,
and
that
no
one
could
assist
us
,
to
take
much
notice
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
Dora
came
stealing
down
in
her
little
slippers
,
to
meet
me
,
now
that
I
was
alone
;
and
cried
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
said
I
had
been
hard
-
hearted
<EOS>
and
she
had
been
naughty
;
and
I
said
much
the
same
thing
in
effect
,
I
believe
;
and
we
made
it
up
,
and
agreed
that
our
first
little
difference
was
to
be
our
last
,
and
that
we
were
never
to
have
another
if
we
lived
a
hundred
years
.
   
<EOS>
The
next
domestic
trial
we
went
through
,
was
the
Ordeal
of
Servants
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
Anne
's
cousin
deserted
into
our
coal
-
hole
,
and
was
brought
out
,
to
our
great
amazement
,
by
a
piquet
of
his
companions
in
arms
,
who
took
him
away
handcuffed
in
a
procession
that
covered
our
front
-
garden
with
ignominy
.
 
<EOS>
This
nerved
me
to
get
rid
of
Mary
Anne
,
who
went
so
mildly
,
on
receipt
of
wages
,
that
I
was
surprised
,
until
I
found
out
about
the
tea
-
spoons
,
and
also
about
the
little
sums
she
had
borrowed
in
my
name
of
the
tradespeople
without
authority
.
 
<EOS>
After
an
interval
of
Mrs
Kidgerbury
---
the
oldest
inhabitant
of
Kentish
Town
,
I
believe
,
who
went
out
charing
,
but
was
too
feeble
to
execute
her
conceptions
of
that
art
<EOS>
---
we
found
another
treasure
,
who
was
one
of
the
most
amiable
of
women
,
but
who
generally
made
a
point
of
falling
either
up
or
down
the
kitchen
stairs
with
the
tray
,
and
almost
plunged
into
the
parlour
,
as
into
a
bath
,
with
the
tea
-
things
.
 
<EOS>
The
ravages
committed
by
this
unfortunate
,
rendering
her
dismissal
necessary
<EOS>
,
she
was
succeeded
(
with
intervals
of
Mrs
Kidgerbury
)
by
a
long
line
of
Incapables
;
terminating
in
a
young
person
of
genteel
appearance
,
who
went
to
Greenwich
Fair
in
Dora
's
bonnet
.
 
<EOS>
After
whom
I
remember
nothing
but
an
average
equality
of
failure
.
   
<EOS>
Everybody
we
had
anything
to
do
with
seemed
to
cheat
us
.
 
<EOS>
Our
appearance
in
a
shop
was
a
signal
for
the
damaged
goods
to
be
brought
out
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
bought
a
lobster
,
it
was
full
of
water
.
 
<EOS>
All
our
meat
turned
out
to
be
tough
,
and
there
was
hardly
any
crust
to
our
loaves
.
 
<EOS>
In
search
of
the
principle
on
which
joints
ought
to
be
roasted
,
to
be
roasted
enough
,
and
not
too
much
,
I
myself
referred
to
the
Cookery
Book
,
and
found
it
there
established
as
the
allowance
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
every
pound
,
and
say
a
quarter
over
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
principle
always
failed
us
by
some
curious
fatality
,
and
we
never
could
hit
any
medium
between
redness
and
cinders
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
reason
to
believe
that
in
accomplishing
these
failures
we
incurred
a
far
greater
expense
than
if
we
had
achieved
a
series
of
triumphs
.
 
<EOS>
It
appeared
to
me
,
on
looking
over
the
tradesmen
's
books
,
as
if
we
might
have
kept
the
basement
storey
paved
with
butter
,
such
was
the
extensive
scale
of
our
consumption
of
that
article
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
the
Excise
returns
of
the
period
may
have
exhibited
any
increase
in
the
demand
for
pepper
;
but
if
our
performances
did
not
affect
the
market
,
I
should
say
several
families
must
have
left
off
using
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
most
wonderful
fact
of
all
was
,
that
we
never
had
anything
in
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
As
to
the
washerwoman
pawning
the
clothes
,
and
coming
in
a
state
of
penitent
intoxication
to
apologize
,
I
suppose
that
might
have
happened
several
times
to
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
Also
the
chimney
on
fire
,
the
parish
engine
,
and
perjury
on
the
part
of
the
Beadle
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
apprehend
that
we
were
personally
fortunate
in
engaging
a
servant
with
a
taste
for
cordials
,
who
swelled
our
running
account
for
porter
at
the
public
-
house
by
such
inexplicable
items
as
"
quartern
rum
shrub
(
Mrs
C
)
"
;
"
Half
-
quartern
gin
and
cloves
(
Mrs
C
)
"
;
"
Glass
rum
and
peppermint
(
Mrs
C
)
"
---
the
parentheses
always
referring
to
Dora
,
who
was
supposed
,
it
appeared
on
explanation
,
to
have
imbibed
the
whole
of
these
refreshments
.
   
<EOS>
One
of
our
first
feats
in
the
housekeeping
way
was
a
little
dinner
to
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
I
met
him
in
town
,
and
asked
him
to
walk
out
with
me
that
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
He
readily
consenting
<EOS>
,
I
wrote
to
Dora
,
saying
I
would
bring
him
home
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
pleasant
weather
,
and
on
the
road
we
made
my
domestic
happiness
the
theme
of
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
was
very
full
of
it
;
and
said
,
that
,
picturing
himself
with
such
a
home
,
and
Sophy
waiting
and
preparing
for
him
,
he
could
think
of
nothing
wanting
to
complete
his
bliss
.
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
wished
for
a
prettier
little
wife
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
table
,
but
I
certainly
could
have
wished
,
when
we
sat
down
,
for
a
little
more
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
how
it
was
,
but
though
there
were
only
two
of
us
,
we
were
at
once
always
cramped
for
room
,
and
yet
had
always
room
enough
to
lose
everything
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
suspect
it
may
have
been
because
nothing
had
a
place
of
its
own
,
except
Jip
's
pagoda
,
which
invariably
blocked
up
the
main
thoroughfare
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
present
occasion
,
Traddles
was
so
hemmed
in
by
the
pagoda
and
the
guitar
-
case
,
and
<EOS>
Dora
's
flower
-
painting
,
and
my
writing
-
table
,
that
I
had
serious
doubts
of
the
possibility
of
his
using
his
knife
and
fork
;
but
he
protested
,
with
his
own
good
-
humour
,
"
Oceans
of
room
,
Copperfield
!
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
Oceans
!
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
another
thing
I
could
have
wished
,
namely
,
that
Jip
had
never
been
encouraged
to
walk
about
the
tablecloth
during
dinner
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
think
there
was
something
disorderly
in
his
being
there
at
all
,
even
if
he
had
not
been
in
the
habit
of
putting
his
foot
in
the
salt
or
the
melted
butter
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
he
seemed
to
think
he
was
introduced
expressly
to
keep
Traddles
at
bay
;
and
he
barked
at
my
old
friend
,
and
made
short
runs
at
his
plate
,
with
such
undaunted
pertinacity
,
that
he
may
be
said
to
have
engrossed
the
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
However
,
as
I
knew
how
tender
-
hearted
<EOS>
my
dear
Dora
was
,
and
how
sensitive
she
would
be
to
any
slight
upon
her
favourite
<EOS>
,
I
hinted
no
objection
.
 
<EOS>
For
similar
reasons
I
made
no
allusion
to
the
skirmishing
plates
upon
the
floor
;
or
to
the
disreputable
appearance
of
the
castors
,
which
were
all
at
sixes
and
sevens
,
and
looked
drunk
;
or
to
the
further
blockade
of
Traddles
by
wandering
vegetable
dishes
and
jugs
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
wondering
in
my
own
mind
,
as
I
contemplated
the
boiled
leg
of
mutton
before
me
,
previous
to
carving
it
<EOS>
,
how
it
came
to
pass
that
our
joints
of
meat
were
of
such
extraordinary
shapes
---
and
whether
our
butcher
contracted
for
all
the
deformed
sheep
that
came
into
the
world
;
but
I
kept
my
reflections
to
myself
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
love
,
"
said
I
to
Dora
,
"
what
have
you
got
in
that
dish
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
imagine
why
Dora
had
been
making
tempting
little
faces
at
me
,
as
if
she
wanted
to
kiss
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oysters
,
dear
,
"
said
Dora
,
timidly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Was
that
YOUR
thought
?
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
delighted
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ye
-
yes
,
Doady
,
"
said
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
never
was
a
happier
one
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
,
laying
down
the
carving
-
knife
and
fork
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
Traddles
likes
so
much
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ye
<EOS>
-
yes
,
Doady
,
"
said
Dora
,
"
<EOS>
and
so
I
bought
a
beautiful
little
barrel
of
them
,
and
the
man
said
they
were
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
---
I
am
afraid
there
's
something
the
matter
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
do
n't
seem
right
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
Dora
shook
her
head
,
and
diamonds
twinkled
in
her
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
are
only
opened
in
both
shells
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
the
top
one
off
,
my
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
it
wo
n't
come
off
!
"
<EOS>
said
Dora
,
trying
very
hard
,
and
looking
very
much
distressed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
Copperfield
,
"
said
Traddles
,
cheerfully
examining
the
dish
,
"
I
think
it
is
in
consequence
---
they
are
capital
oysters
,
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
is
in
consequence
---
of
their
never
having
been
opened
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
never
had
been
opened
;
and
we
had
no
oyster
-
knives
---
and
could
n't
have
used
them
if
we
had
;
so
we
looked
at
the
oysters
and
ate
the
mutton
.
 
<EOS>
At
least
we
ate
as
much
of
it
as
was
done
,
and
made
up
with
capers
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
permitted
him
,
I
am
satisfied
that
Traddles
would
have
made
a
perfect
savage
of
himself
,
and
eaten
a
plateful
of
raw
meat
,
to
express
enjoyment
of
the
repast
;
but
I
would
hear
of
no
such
immolation
on
the
altar
of
friendship
,
and
we
had
a
course
of
bacon
instead
;
there
happening
,
by
good
fortune
,
to
be
cold
bacon
in
the
larder
.
   
<EOS>
My
poor
little
wife
was
in
such
affliction
when
she
thought
I
should
be
annoyed
,
and
in
such
a
state
of
joy
when
she
found
I
was
not
,
that
the
discomfiture
I
had
subdued
,
very
soon
vanished
,
and
we
passed
a
happy
evening
;
Dora
sitting
with
her
arm
on
my
chair
while
Traddles
and
I
discussed
a
glass
of
wine
,
and
taking
every
opportunity
of
whispering
in
my
ear
that
it
was
so
good
of
me
not
to
be
a
cruel
,
cross
old
boy
.
 
<EOS>
By
and
by
<EOS>
she
made
tea
for
us
;
which
it
was
so
pretty
to
see
her
do
,
as
if
she
was
busying
herself
with
a
set
of
doll
's
tea
-
things
,
that
I
was
not
particular
about
the
quality
of
the
beverage
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Traddles
and
I
played
a
game
or
two
at
cribbage
;
and
Dora
singing
to
the
guitar
the
while
,
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
our
courtship
and
marriage
were
a
tender
dream
of
mine
,
and
the
night
when
I
first
listened
to
her
voice
were
not
yet
over
.
   
<EOS>
When
Traddles
went
away
,
and
I
came
back
into
the
parlour
from
seeing
him
out
,
my
wife
planted
her
chair
close
to
mine
,
and
sat
down
by
my
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
,
"
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
try
to
teach
me
,
Doady
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
teach
myself
first
,
Dora
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
as
bad
as
you
,
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
But
you
can
learn
,
"
she
returned
;
"
<EOS>
and
you
are
a
clever
,
clever
man
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
mouse
!
<EOS>
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
"
resumed
my
wife
,
after
a
long
silence
,
"
that
I
could
have
gone
down
into
the
country
for
a
whole
year
,
and
lived
with
Agnes
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
hands
were
clasped
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
her
chin
rested
on
them
,
and
her
blue
eyes
looked
quietly
into
mine
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
so
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
might
have
improved
me
,
and
I
think
I
might
have
learned
from
her
,
"
said
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
in
good
time
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
has
had
her
father
to
take
care
of
for
these
many
years
,
you
should
remember
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
she
was
quite
a
child
,
she
was
the
Agnes
whom
we
know
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
call
me
a
name
I
want
you
to
call
me
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Dora
,
without
moving
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
stupid
name
,
"
she
said
,
shaking
her
curls
for
a
moment
.
"
<EOS>
Child
-
wife
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
laughingly
asked
my
child
-
wife
what
<EOS>
her
fancy
was
in
desiring
to
be
so
called
.
 
<EOS>
She
answered
without
moving
,
otherwise
than
as
the
arm
I
twined
about
her
may
have
brought
her
blue
eyes
nearer
to
me
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
,
you
silly
fellow
,
that
you
should
use
the
name
instead
of
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
mean
that
you
should
think
of
me
that
way
.
<EOS>
When
you
are
going
to
be
angry
with
me
,
say
to
yourself
,
"
it
's
only
my
child
-
wife
!
"
<EOS>
When
I
am
very
disappointing
,
say
,
"
I
knew
,
a
long
time
ago
,
that
she
would
make
but
a
child
-
wife
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
you
miss
what
I
should
like
to
be
,
and
I
think
can
never
be
,
say
,
"
still
my
foolish
child
-
wife
loves
me
!
"
<EOS>
For
indeed
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
had
not
been
serious
with
her
;
having
no
idea
until
now
,
that
she
was
serious
herself
.
 
<EOS>
But
her
affectionate
nature
was
so
happy
in
what
I
now
said
to
her
with
my
whole
heart
,
that
her
face
became
a
laughing
one
before
her
glittering
eyes
were
dry
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
soon
my
child
-
wife
indeed
;
sitting
down
on
the
floor
outside
the
Chinese
House
,
ringing
all
the
little
bells
one
after
another
,
to
punish
Jip
for
his
recent
bad
behaviour
;
while
Jip
lay
blinking
in
the
doorway
with
his
head
out
,
even
too
lazy
to
be
teased
.
   
<EOS>
This
appeal
of
Dora
's
made
a
strong
impression
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
back
on
the
time
I
write
of
;
I
invoke
the
innocent
figure
that
I
dearly
loved
,
to
come
out
from
the
mists
and
shadows
of
the
past
,
and
turn
its
gentle
head
towards
me
once
again
;
and
I
can
still
declare
that
this
one
little
speech
was
constantly
in
my
memory
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
not
have
used
it
to
the
best
account
;
I
was
young
and
inexperienced
;
but
I
never
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
its
artless
pleading
.
   
<EOS>
Dora
told
me
,
shortly
afterwards
,
that
she
was
going
to
be
a
wonderful
housekeeper
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
she
polished
the
tablets
,
pointed
the
pencil
,
bought
an
immense
account
-
book
,
carefully
stitched
up
with
a
needle
and
thread
all
the
leaves
of
the
Cookery
Book
which
Jip
had
torn
,
and
made
quite
a
desperate
little
attempt
"
to
be
good
"
,
as
she
called
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
figures
had
the
old
obstinate
propensity
---
they
WOULD
NOT
add
up
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
entered
two
or
three
laborious
items
in
the
account
-
book
,
Jip
would
walk
over
the
page
,
wagging
his
tail
,
and
smear
them
all
out
.
 
<EOS>
Her
own
little
right
-
hand
middle
finger
got
steeped
to
the
very
bone
in
ink
;
and
I
think
that
was
the
only
decided
result
obtained
.
   
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
of
an
evening
,
when
I
was
at
home
and
at
work
---
for
I
wrote
a
good
deal
now
,
and
was
beginning
in
a
small
way
to
be
known
as
a
writer
---
I
would
lay
down
my
pen
,
and
watch
my
child
-
wife
trying
to
be
good
.
 
<EOS>
First
of
all
,
she
would
bring
out
the
immense
account
-
book
,
and
lay
it
down
upon
the
table
,
with
a
deep
sigh
.
<EOS>
Then
she
would
open
it
at
the
place
where
Jip
had
made
it
illegible
last
night
,
and
call
Jip
up
,
to
look
at
his
misdeeds
.
 
<EOS>
This
would
occasion
a
diversion
in
Jip
's
favour
,
and
some
inking
of
his
nose
,
perhaps
,
as
a
penalty
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
would
tell
Jip
to
lie
down
on
the
table
instantly
,
"
like
a
lion
"
---
which
was
one
of
his
tricks
,
though
I
can
not
say
the
likeness
was
striking
---
and
,
if
he
were
in
an
obedient
humour
,
he
would
obey
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
would
take
up
a
pen
,
and
begin
to
write
,
and
find
a
hair
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
would
take
up
another
pen
,
and
begin
to
write
,
and
find
that
it
spluttered
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
would
take
up
another
pen
,
and
begin
to
write
,
and
say
in
a
low
voice
,
"
Oh
,
it
's
a
talking
pen
,
and
will
disturb
Doady
!
"
<EOS>
And
then
she
would
give
it
up
as
a
bad
job
,
and
put
the
account
-
book
away
,
after
pretending
to
crush
the
lion
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
Or
,
if
she
were
in
a
very
sedate
and
serious
state
of
mind
,
she
would
sit
down
with
the
tablets
,
and
a
little
basket
of
bills
and
other
documents
,
which
looked
more
like
curl
-
papers
than
anything
else
,
and
endeavour
to
get
some
result
out
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
After
severely
comparing
one
with
another
,
and
making
entries
on
the
tablets
,
and
blotting
them
out
,
and
counting
all
the
fingers
of
her
left
hand
over
and
over
again
,
backwards
and
forwards
,
she
would
be
so
vexed
and
discouraged
,
and
would
look
so
unhappy
,
that
it
gave
me
pain
to
see
her
bright
face
clouded
---
and
for
me
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
I
would
go
softly
to
her
,
and
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
,
Dora
?
"
   
<EOS>
Dora
would
look
up
hopelessly
,
and
reply
,
"
They
wo
n't
come
right
.
<EOS>
They
make
my
head
ache
so
.
 
<EOS>
And
they
wo
n't
do
anything
I
want
!
"
   
<EOS>
Then
I
would
say
,
"
Now
let
us
try
together
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
show
you
,
Dora
.
"
   
<EOS>
Then
I
would
commence
a
practical
demonstration
,
to
which
Dora
would
pay
profound
attention
,
perhaps
for
five
minutes
;
when
she
would
begin
to
be
dreadfully
tired
,
and
would
lighten
the
subject
by
curling
my
hair
,
or
trying
the
effect
of
my
face
with
my
shirt
-
collar
turned
down
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
tacitly
checked
this
playfulness
,
and
persisted
,
she
would
look
so
scared
and
disconsolate
,
as
she
became
more
and
more
bewildered
,
that
the
remembrance
of
her
natural
gaiety
when
I
first
strayed
into
her
path
,
and
of
her
being
my
child
-
wife
,
would
come
reproachfully
upon
me
;
and
I
would
lay
the
pencil
down
,
and
call
for
the
guitar
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
a
great
deal
of
work
to
do
,
and
had
many
anxieties
,
but
the
same
considerations
made
me
keep
them
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
far
from
sure
,
now
,
that
it
was
right
to
do
this
,
but
I
did
it
for
my
child
-
wife
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
I
search
my
breast
,
and
I
commit
its
secrets
,
if
I
know
them
,
without
any
reservation
to
this
paper
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
unhappy
loss
or
want
of
something
had
,
I
am
conscious
,
some
place
in
my
heart
;
but
not
to
the
embitterment
of
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
walked
alone
in
the
fine
weather
,
and
thought
of
the
summer
days
when
all
the
air
had
been
filled
with
my
boyish
enchantment
,
I
did
miss
something
of
the
realization
of
my
dreams
;
but
I
thought
it
was
a
softened
glory
of
the
Past
,
which
nothing
could
have
thrown
upon
the
present
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
feel
,
sometimes
,
for
a
little
while
,
that
I
could
have
wished
my
wife
had
been
my
counsellor
;
had
had
more
character
and
purpose
,
to
sustain
me
and
improve
me
by
;
had
been
endowed
with
power
to
fill
up
the
void
which
somewhere
seemed
to
be
about
me
;
but
I
felt
as
if
this
were
an
unearthly
consummation
of
my
happiness
,
that
never
had
been
meant
to
be
,
and
never
could
have
been
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
a
boyish
husband
as
to
years
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
known
the
softening
influence
of
no
other
sorrows
or
experiences
than
those
recorded
in
these
leaves
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
did
any
wrong
,
as
I
may
have
done
much
,
I
did
it
in
mistaken
love
,
and
in
my
want
of
wisdom
.
 
<EOS>
I
write
the
exact
truth
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
avail
me
nothing
to
extenuate
it
now
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
it
was
that
I
took
upon
myself
the
toils
and
cares
of
our
life
,
and
had
no
partner
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
We
lived
much
as
before
,
in
reference
to
our
scrambling
household
arrangements
;
but
I
had
got
used
to
those
,
and
Dora
<EOS>
I
was
pleased
to
see
was
seldom
vexed
now
.
<EOS>
She
was
bright
and
cheerful
in
the
old
childish
way
,
loved
me
dearly
,
and
was
happy
with
her
old
trifles
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
debates
were
heavy
---
I
mean
as
to
length
,
not
quality
,
for
in
the
last
respect
they
were
not
often
otherwise
---
and
I
went
home
late
,
Dora
would
never
rest
when
she
heard
my
footsteps
,
but
would
always
come
downstairs
to
meet
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
my
evenings
were
unoccupied
by
the
pursuit
for
which
I
had
qualified
myself
with
so
much
pains
,
and
I
was
engaged
in
writing
at
home
,
she
would
sit
quietly
near
me
,
however
late
the
hour
,
and
be
so
mute
,
<EOS>
that
I
would
often
think
she
had
dropped
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
But
generally
,
when
I
raised
my
head
,
I
saw
her
blue
eyes
looking
at
me
with
the
quiet
attention
of
which
I
have
already
spoken
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
a
weary
boy
!
"
said
Dora
one
night
,
when
I
met
her
eyes
as
I
was
shutting
up
my
desk
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
weary
girl
!
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
more
to
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
go
to
bed
another
time
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
far
too
late
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
do
n't
send
me
to
bed
!
"
<EOS>
pleaded
Dora
,
coming
to
my
side
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
do
n't
do
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dora
!
"
<EOS>
To
my
amazement
she
was
sobbing
on
my
neck
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
well
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
not
happy
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
quite
well
,
and
very
happy
!
<EOS>
"
said
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
say
you
'll
let
me
stop
,
and
see
you
write
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
a
sight
for
such
bright
eyes
at
midnight
!
<EOS>
"
I
replied
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
they
bright
,
though
?
"
<EOS>
returned
Dora
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
so
glad
they
're
bright
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Little
Vanity
!
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
vanity
;
it
was
only
harmless
delight
in
my
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
that
very
well
,
before
she
told
me
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
think
them
pretty
,
say
I
may
always
stop
,
and
see
you
write
!
"
said
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
them
pretty
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
pretty
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
let
me
always
stop
and
see
you
write
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
that
wo
n't
improve
their
brightness
,
Dora
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
will
!
 
<EOS>
Because
,
you
clever
boy
,
you
'll
not
forget
me
then
,
while
you
are
full
of
silent
fancies
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
mind
it
,
if
I
say
something
very
,
very
silly
?
 
<EOS>
---
more
than
usual
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Dora
,
peeping
over
my
shoulder
into
my
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
wonderful
thing
is
that
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Please
let
me
hold
the
pens
,
"
said
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
have
something
to
do
with
all
those
many
hours
when
you
are
so
industrious
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
hold
the
pens
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
remembrance
of
her
pretty
joy
when
I
said
yes
,
brings
tears
into
my
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
time
I
sat
down
to
write
,
and
regularly
afterwards
,
she
sat
in
her
old
place
,
with
a
spare
bundle
of
pens
at
her
side
.
 
<EOS>
Her
triumph
in
this
connexion
with
my
work
,
and
her
delight
when
I
wanted
a
new
pen
---
which
I
very
often
feigned
to
do
---
suggested
to
me
a
new
way
of
pleasing
my
child
-
wife
.
 
<EOS>
I
occasionally
made
a
pretence
of
wanting
a
page
or
two
of
manuscript
copied
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Dora
was
in
her
glory
.
 
<EOS>
The
preparations
she
made
for
this
great
work
,
the
aprons
she
put
on
,
the
bibs
she
borrowed
from
the
kitchen
to
keep
off
the
ink
,
the
time
she
took
,
the
innumerable
stoppages
she
made
to
have
a
laugh
with
Jip
as
if
he
understood
it
all
,
her
conviction
that
her
work
was
incomplete
unless
she
signed
her
name
at
the
end
,
and
the
way
in
which
she
would
bring
it
to
me
,
like
a
school
-
copy
,
and
then
,
when
I
praised
it
,
clasp
me
round
the
neck
,
are
touching
recollections
to
me
,
simple
as
they
might
appear
to
other
men
.
   
<EOS>
She
took
possession
of
the
keys
soon
after
this
,
and
went
jingling
about
the
house
with
the
whole
bunch
in
a
little
basket
,
tied
to
her
slender
waist
.
 
<EOS>
I
seldom
found
that
the
places
to
which
they
belonged
were
locked
,
or
that
they
were
of
any
use
except
as
a
plaything
for
Jip
---
but
Dora
was
pleased
,
and
that
pleased
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
quite
satisfied
that
a
good
deal
was
effected
by
this
make
-
belief
of
housekeeping
;
and
was
as
merry
as
if
we
had
been
keeping
a
baby
-
house
,
for
a
joke
.
   
<EOS>
So
we
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
Dora
was
hardly
less
affectionate
to
my
aunt
than
to
me
,
and
often
told
her
of
the
time
when
she
was
afraid
she
was
"
a
cross
old
thing
"
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
my
aunt
unbend
more
systematically
to
anyone
.
 
<EOS>
She
courted
Jip
,
though
Jip
never
responded
;
listened
,
day
after
day
,
to
the
guitar
,
though
I
am
afraid
she
had
no
taste
for
music
;
never
attacked
the
Incapables
,
though
the
temptation
must
have
been
severe
;
went
wonderful
distances
on
foot
to
purchase
,
as
surprises
,
any
trifles
that
she
found
out
Dora
wanted
;
and
never
came
in
by
the
garden
,
and
missed
her
from
the
room
,
but
she
would
call
out
,
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
,
in
a
voice
that
sounded
cheerfully
all
over
the
house
:
   
<EOS>
"
Where
's
Little
Blossom
?
"
      
<EOS>
Chapter
45
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
fulfils
my
aunt
's
predictions
 
<EOS>
It
was
some
time
now
,
since
I
had
left
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
Living
in
his
neighbourhood
,
I
saw
him
frequently
;
and
we
all
went
to
his
house
on
two
or
three
occasions
to
dinner
or
tea
.
 
<EOS>
The
Old
Soldier
was
in
permanent
quarters
under
the
Doctor
's
roof
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
exactly
the
same
as
ever
,
and
the
same
immortal
butterflies
hovered
over
her
cap
.
   
<EOS>
Like
some
other
mothers
,
whom
I
have
known
in
the
course
of
my
life
,
Mrs
Markleham
was
far
more
fond
of
pleasure
than
her
daughter
was
.
 
<EOS>
She
required
a
great
deal
of
amusement
,
and
,
like
a
deep
old
soldier
,
pretended
,
in
consulting
her
own
inclinations
,
to
be
devoting
herself
to
her
child
.
 
<EOS>
The
Doctor
's
desire
that
Annie
should
be
entertained
,
was
therefore
particularly
acceptable
to
this
excellent
parent
;
who
expressed
unqualified
approval
of
his
discretion
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
,
indeed
,
that
she
probed
the
Doctor
's
wound
without
knowing
it
.
 
<EOS>
Meaning
nothing
but
a
certain
matured
frivolity
and
selfishness
,
not
always
inseparable
from
full
-
blown
years
<EOS>
,
I
think
she
confirmed
him
in
his
fear
that
he
was
a
constraint
upon
his
young
wife
,
and
that
there
was
no
congeniality
of
feeling
between
them
,
by
so
strongly
commending
his
design
of
lightening
the
load
of
her
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
soul
,
"
she
said
to
him
one
day
when
I
was
present
,
"
you
know
there
is
no
doubt
it
would
be
a
little
pokey
for
Annie
to
be
always
shut
up
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
nodded
his
benevolent
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
she
comes
to
her
mother
's
age
,
"
said
Mrs
Markleham
,
with
a
flourish
of
her
fan
,
"
then
it
'll
be
another
thing
.
 
<EOS>
You
might
put
ME
into
a
Jail
,
with
genteel
society
and
a
rubber
,
and
I
should
never
care
to
come
out
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
Annie
,
you
know
;
and
Annie
is
not
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
surely
,
"
said
the
Doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
best
of
creatures
---
<EOS>
no
,
I
beg
your
pardon
!
"
<EOS>
for
the
Doctor
made
a
gesture
of
deprecation
,
"
I
must
say
before
your
face
,
as
I
always
say
behind
your
back
,
you
are
the
best
of
creatures
;
but
of
course
you
do
n't
---
now
do
you
?
 
<EOS>
---
enter
into
the
same
pursuits
and
fancies
as
Annie
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
in
a
sorrowful
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"

No
,
of
course
not
,
"
retorted
the
Old
Soldier
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
your
Dictionary
,
for
example
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
useful
work
a
Dictionary
is
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
necessary
work
!
 
<EOS>
The
meanings
of
words
!
 
<EOS>
Without
Doctor
Johnson
,
or
somebody
of
that
sort
,
we
might
have
been
at
this
present
moment
calling
an
Italian
-
iron
,
a
bedstead
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
ca
n't
expect
a
Dictionary
---
especially
when
it
's
making
---
to
interest
Annie
,
can
we
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
Doctor
shook
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
's
why
I
so
much
approve
,
"
said
Mrs
Markleham
,
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
with
her
shut
-
up
fan
,
"
of
your
thoughtfulness
.
<EOS>
It
shows
that
you
do
n't
expect
,
as
many
elderly
people
do
expect
,
old
heads
on
young
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
studied
Annie
's
character
,
and
you
understand
it
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
find
so
charming
!
"
   
<EOS>
Even
the
calm
and
patient
face
of
Doctor
Strong
expressed
some
little
sense
of
pain
,
I
thought
,
under
the
infliction
of
these
compliments
.
   
<EOS>
"
Therefore
,
my
dear
Doctor
,
"
said
the
Old
Soldier
,
giving
him
several
affectionate
taps
,
"
you
may
command
me
,
at
all
times
and
seasons
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
do
understand
that
I
am
entirely
at
your
service
.
<EOS>
I
am
ready
to
go
with
Annie
to
operas
,
concerts
,
exhibitions
,
all
kinds
of
places
;
and
you
shall
never
find
that
I
am
tired
.
 
<EOS>
Duty
,
my
dear
Doctor
,
before
every
consideration
in
the
universe
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
as
good
as
her
word
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
one
of
those
people
who
can
bear
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
,
and
she
never
flinched
in
her
perseverance
in
the
cause
.
 
<EOS>
She
seldom
got
hold
of
the
newspaper
(
which
she
settled
herself
down
in
the
softest
chair
in
the
house
to
read
through
an
eye
-
glass
,
every
day
,
for
two
hours
)
,
but
she
found
out
something
that
she
was
certain
<EOS>
Annie
would
like
to
see
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
for
Annie
to
protest
that
she
was
weary
of
such
things
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mother
's
remonstrance
always
was
,
"
Now
,
my
dear
Annie
,
I
am
sure
you
know
better
;
and
I
must
tell
you
,
my
love
,
that
you
are
not
making
a
proper
return
for
the
kindness
of
Doctor
Strong
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
usually
said
in
the
Doctor
's
presence
,
and
appeared
to
me
to
constitute
Annie
's
principal
inducement
for
withdrawing
her
objections
when
she
made
any
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
general
she
resigned
herself
to
her
mother
,
and
went
where
the
Old
Soldier
would
.
   
<EOS>
It
rarely
happened
now
that
Mr
Maldon
accompanied
them
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
my
aunt
and
Dora
were
invited
to
do
so
,
and
accepted
the
invitation
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
Dora
only
was
asked
.
 
<EOS>
The
time
had
been
,
when
I
should
have
been
uneasy
in
her
going
;
but
reflection
on
what
had
passed
that
former
night
in
the
Doctor
's
study
,
had
made
a
change
in
my
mistrust
.
 
<EOS>
I
believed
that
the
Doctor
was
right
,
and
I
had
no
worse
suspicions
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
rubbed
her
nose
sometimes
when
she
happened
to
be
alone
with
me
,
and
said
she
could
n't
make
it
out
;
she
wished
they
were
happier
;
she
did
n't
think
our
military
friend
(
so
she
always
called
the
Old
Soldier
)
<EOS>
mended
the
matter
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
further
expressed
her
opinion
,
"
that
if
our
military
friend
would
cut
off
those
butterflies
,
and
give
'em
to
the
chimney
-
sweepers
for
May
-
day
,
it
would
look
like
the
beginning
of
something
sensible
on
her
part
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
her
abiding
reliance
was
on
Mr
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
That
man
had
evidently
an
idea
in
his
head
,
she
said
;
and
if
he
could
only
once
pen
it
up
into
a
corner
,
which
was
his
great
difficulty
,
he
would
distinguish
himself
in
some
extraordinary
manner
.
   
<EOS>
Unconscious
of
this
prediction
,
Mr
Dick
continued
to
occupy
precisely
the
same
ground
in
reference
to
the
Doctor
and
to
Mrs
Strong
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
neither
to
advance
nor
to
recede
.
 
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
have
settled
into
his
original
foundation
,
like
a
building
;
and
I
must
confess
that
my
faith
in
his
ever
Moving
,
was
not
much
greater
than
if
he
had
been
a
building
.
   
<EOS>
But
one
night
,
when
I
had
been
married
some
months
,
Mr
Dick
put
his
head
into
the
parlour
,
where
I
was
writing
alone
<EOS>
(
Dora
having
gone
out
with
my
aunt
to
take
tea
with
the
two
little
birds
)
,
and
said
,
with
a
significant
cough
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
could
n't
speak
to
me
without
inconveniencing
yourself
,
Trotwood
,
I
am
afraid
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
Mr
Dick
,
"
said
I
;
"
come
in
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Trotwood
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
laying
his
finger
on
the
side
of
his
nose
,
after
he
had
shaken
hands
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Before
I
sit
down
,
I
wish
to
make
an
observation
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
your
aunt
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
little
,
"
I
replied
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
is
the
most
wonderful
woman
in
the
world
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
After
the
delivery
of
this
communication
,
which
he
shot
out
of
himself
as
if
he
were
loaded
with
it
,
Mr
Dick
sat
down
with
greater
gravity
than
usual
,
and
looked
at
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
boy
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
"
I
am
going
to
put
a
question
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
many
as
you
please
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
consider
me
,
sir
?
"
asked
Mr
Dick
,
folding
his
arms
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
dear
old
friend
,
"
said
I.
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Trotwood
,
"
returned
Mr
Dick
,
laughing
,
and
reaching
across
in
high
glee
to
shake
hands
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
mean
,
boy
,
"
resuming
his
gravity
<EOS>
,
"
what
do
you
consider
me
in
this
respect
?
"
touching
his
forehead
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
puzzled
how
to
answer
,
but
he
helped
me
with
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
Weak
?
"
said
Mr
Dick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
I
replied
,
dubiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rather
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Exactly
!
"
cried
Mr
Dick
,
who
seemed
quite
enchanted
by
my
reply
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
,
Trotwood
,
when
they
took
some
of
the
trouble
out
of
you
-
know
-
who
's
head
,
and
put
it
you
know
where
,
there
was
a

"
Mr
Dick
made
his
two
hands
revolve
very
fast
about
each
other
a
great
number
of
times
,
and
then
brought
them
into
collision
,
and
rolled
them
over
and
over
one
another
,
to
express
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
was
that
sort
of
thing
done
to
me
somehow
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
nodded
at
him
,
and
he
nodded
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
boy
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
dropping
his
voice
to
a
whisper
,
"
I
am
simple
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
would
have
qualified
that
conclusion
,
but
he
stopped
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
!
 
<EOS>
She
pretends
I
am
not
.
 
<EOS>
She
wo
n't
hear
of
it
;
but
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
had
n't
stood
my
friend
,
sir
,
I
should
have
been
shut
up
,
to
lead
a
dismal
life
these
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
provide
for
her
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
spend
the
copying
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
it
in
a
box
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
made
a
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
leave
it
all
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
shall
be
rich
---
noble
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
took
out
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
and
wiped
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
folded
it
up
with
great
care
,
pressed
it
smooth
between
his
two
hands
,
put
it
in
his
pocket
,
and
seemed
to
put
my
aunt
away
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
you
are
a
scholar
,
Trotwood
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
fine
scholar
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
what
a
learned
man
,
what
a
great
man
,
the
Doctor
is
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
what
honour
he
has
always
done
me
.
 
<EOS>
Not
proud
in
his
wisdom
.
 
<EOS>
Humble
,
humble
<EOS>
---
condescending
even
to
poor
Dick
,
who
is
simple
and
knows
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
sent
his
name
up
,
on
a
scrap
of
paper
,
to
the
kite
,
along
the
string
,
when
it
has
been
in
the
sky
,
among
the
larks
.
 
<EOS>
The
kite
has
been
glad
to
receive
it
,
sir
,
and
the
sky
has
been
brighter
with
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
delighted
him
by
saying
,
most
heartily
,
that
the
Doctor
was
deserving
of
our
best
respect
and
highest
esteem
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
his
beautiful
wife
is
a
star
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
shining
star
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
her
shine
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
"
bringing
his
chair
nearer
,
and
laying
one
hand
upon
my
knee
---
"
clouds
,
sir
---
clouds
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
answered
the
solicitude
which
his
face
expressed
,
by
conveying
the
same
expression
into
my
own
,
and
shaking
my
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
clouds
?
"
said
Mr
Dick
.
   
<EOS>
He
looked
so
wistfully
into
my
face
,
and
was
so
anxious
to
understand
,
that
I
took
great
pains
to
answer
him
slowly
and
distinctly
,
as
I
might
have
entered
on
an
explanation
to
a
child
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
some
unfortunate
division
between
them
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Some
unhappy
cause
of
separation
.
 
<EOS>
A
secret
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
inseparable
from
the
discrepancy
in
their
years
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
grown
up
out
of
almost
nothing
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
,
who
had
told
off
every
sentence
with
a
thoughtful
nod
,
paused
when
I
had
done
,
and
sat
considering
,
with
his
eyes
upon
my
face
,
and
his
hand
upon
my
knee
.
   
<EOS>
"
Doctor
not
angry
with
her
,
Trotwood
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
after
some
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
Devoted
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
I
have
got
it
,
boy
!
"
said
Mr
Dick
.
   
<EOS>
The
sudden
exultation
with
which
he
slapped
me
on
the
knee
,
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
,
with
his
eyebrows
lifted
up
as
high
as
he
could
possibly
lift
them
,
made
me
think
him
farther
out
of
his
wits
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
He
became
as
suddenly
grave
again
,
and
leaning
forward
as
before
,
said
---
first
respectfully
taking
out
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
as
if
it
really
did
represent
my
aunt
:
   
<EOS>
"
Most
wonderful
woman
in
the
world
,
Trotwood
.
 
<EOS>
Why
has
she
done
nothing
to
set
things
right
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Too
delicate
and
difficult
a
subject
for
such
interference
<EOS>
,
"
I
replied
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fine
scholar
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
touching
me
with
his
finger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
has
HE
done
nothing
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
the
same
reason
,
"
I
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
,
I
have
got
it
,
boy
!
"
said
Mr
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
stood
up
before
me
,
more
exultingly
than
before
,
nodding
his
head
,
and
striking
himself
repeatedly
upon
the
breast
,
until
one
might
have
supposed
that
he
had
nearly
nodded
and
struck
all
the
breath
out
of
his
body
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
poor
fellow
with
a
craze
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
"
a
simpleton
,
a
weak
-
minded
person
---
present
company
,
you
know
!
<EOS>
"
striking
himself
again
,
"
may
do
what
wonderful
people
may
not
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
bring
them
together
,
boy
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
try
.
 
<EOS>
They
'll
not
blame
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
'll
not
object
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
'll
not
mind
what
I
do
,
if
it
's
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
only
Mr
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
And
who
minds
Dick
?
 
<EOS>
Dick
's
nobody
!
 
<EOS>
Whoo
!
"
<EOS>
He
blew
a
slight
,
contemptuous
breath
,
as
if
he
blew
himself
away
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
fortunate
he
had
proceeded
so
far
with
his
mystery
,
for
we
heard
the
coach
stop
at
the
little
garden
gate
,
which
brought
my
aunt
and
Dora
home
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
word
,
boy
!
"
he
pursued
in
a
whisper
;
"
leave
all
the
blame
with
Dick
---
simple
Dick
---
mad
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
thinking
,
sir
,
for
some
time
,
that
I
was
getting
it
,
and
now
I
have
got
it
.
 
<EOS>
After
what
you
have
said
to
me
,
I
am
sure
I
have
got
it
.
 
<EOS>
All
right
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
another
word
did
Mr
Dick
utter
on
the
subject
;
but
he
made
a
very
telegraph
of
himself
for
the
next
half
-
hour
(
to
the
great
disturbance
of
my
aunt
's
mind
)
,
to
enjoin
inviolable
secrecy
on
me
.
   
<EOS>
To
my
surprise
,
I
heard
no
more
about
it
for
some
two
or
three
weeks
,
though
I
was
sufficiently
interested
in
the
result
of
his
endeavours
;
descrying
a
strange
gleam
of
good
sense
---
I
say
nothing
of
good
feeling
,
for
that
he
always
exhibited
---
in
the
conclusion
to
which
he
had
come
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
I
began
to
believe
,
that
,
in
the
flighty
and
unsettled
state
of
his
mind
,
he
had
either
forgotten
his
intention
or
abandoned
it
.
   
<EOS>
One
fair
evening
,
when
Dora
was
not
inclined
to
go
out
,
my
aunt
and
I
strolled
up
to
the
Doctor
's
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
autumn
,
when
there
were
no
debates
to
vex
the
evening
air
;
and
I
remember
how
the
leaves
smelt
like
our
garden
at
Blunderstone
as
we
trod
them
under
foot
,
and
how
the
old
,
unhappy
feeling
,
seemed
to
go
by
,
on
the
sighing
wind
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
twilight
when
we
reached
the
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Strong
was
just
coming
out
of
the
garden
,
where
Mr
Dick
yet
lingered
,
busy
with
his
knife
,
helping
the
gardener
to
point
some
stakes
.
 
<EOS>
The
Doctor
was
engaged
with
someone
in
his
study
;
but
the
visitor
would
be
gone
directly
,
Mrs
Strong
said
,
and
begged
us
to
remain
and
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
went
into
the
drawing
-
room
with
her
,
and
sat
down
by
the
darkening
window
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
never
any
ceremony
about
the
visits
of
such
old
friends
and
neighbours
as
we
were
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
not
sat
here
many
minutes
,
when
Mrs
Markleham
,
who
usually
contrived
to
be
in
a
fuss
about
something
,
came
bustling
in
,
with
her
newspaper
in
her
hand
,
and
said
,
out
of
breath
,
"
My
goodness
gracious
,
Annie
<EOS>
,
why
did
n't
you
tell
me
there
was
someone
in
the
Study
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
mama
,
"
she
quietly
returned
,
"
how
could
I
know
that
you
desired
the
information
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Desired
the
information
!
"
said
Mrs
Markleham
,
sinking
on
the
sofa
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
had
such
a
turn
in
all
my
life
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
been
to
the
Study
,
then
,
mama
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Annie
.
   
<EOS>
"
BEEN
to
the
Study
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
she
returned
emphatically
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
have
!
 
<EOS>
I
came
upon
the
amiable
creature
---
if
you
'll
imagine
my
feelings
,
Miss
Trotwood
and
David
---
in
the
act
of
making
his
will
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
daughter
looked
round
from
the
window
quickly
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
act
,
my
dear
Annie
,
"
repeated
Mrs
Markleham
,
spreading
the
newspaper
on
her
lap
like
a
table
-
cloth
,
and
patting
her
hands
upon
it
,
"
of
making
his
last
Will
and
Testament
.
 
<EOS>
The
foresight
and
affection
of
the
dear
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
how
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
really
must
,
in
justice
to
the
darling
---
for
he
is
nothing
less
!
<EOS>
---
tell
you
how
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
know
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
that
there
is
never
a
candle
lighted
in
this
house
,
until
one
's
eyes
are
literally
falling
out
of
one
's
head
with
being
stretched
to
read
the
paper
.
<EOS>
And
that
there
is
not
a
chair
in
this
house
,
in
which
a
paper
can
be
what
I
call
,
read
,
except
one
in
the
Study
.
 
<EOS>
This
took
me
to
the
Study
,
where
I
saw
a
light
.
 
<EOS>
I
opened
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
In
company
with
the
dear
Doctor
were
two
professional
people
,
evidently
connected
with
the
law
,
and
they
were
all
three
standing
at
the
table
:
the
darling
Doctor
pen
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
simply
expresses
then
,
"
said
the
Doctor
---
Annie
,
my
love
,
attend
to
the
very
words
---
<EOS>
"
this
simply
expresses
then
,
gentlemen
,
the
confidence
I
have
in
Mrs
Strong
,
and
gives
her
all
unconditionally
?
<EOS>
"
One
of
the
professional
people
replied
,
"
And
gives
her
all
unconditionally
.
"
<EOS>
Upon
that
,
with
the
natural
feelings
of
a
mother
,
I
said
,
"
Good
God
,
I
beg
your
pardon
!
"
<EOS>
fell
over
the
door
-
step
,
and
came
away
through
the
little
back
passage
where
the
pantry
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Strong
opened
the
window
,
and
went
out
into
the
verandah
,
where
she
stood
leaning
against
a
pillar
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
now
is
n't
it
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
is
n't
it
,
David
,
invigorating
,
"
said
Mrs
Markleham
,
mechanically
following
her
with
her
eyes
,
"
to
find
a
man
at
Doctor
Strong
's
time
of
life
,
with
the
strength
of
mind
to
do
this
kind
of
thing
?
 
<EOS>
It
only
shows
how
right
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
to
Annie
,
when
Doctor
Strong
paid
a
very
flattering
visit
to
myself
,
and
made
her
the
subject
of
a
declaration
and
an
offer
,
I
said
,
"
My
dear
,
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
,
in
my
opinion
,
with
reference
to
a
suitable
provision
for
you
,
that
Doctor
Strong
will
do
more
than
he
binds
himself
to
do
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Here
the
bell
rang
,
and
we
heard
the
sound
of
the
visitors
'
feet
as
they
went
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
over
,
no
doubt
,
"
said
the
Old
Soldier
,
after
listening
;
"
the
dear
creature
has
signed
,
sealed
,
and
delivered
,
and
his
mind
's
at
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Well
it
may
be
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
mind
!
 
<EOS>
Annie
,
my
love
,
I
am
going
to
the
Study
with
my
paper
,
for
I
am
a
poor
creature
without
news
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Trotwood
,
David
,
pray
come
and
see
the
Doctor
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
conscious
of
Mr
Dick
's
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
room
,
shutting
up
his
knife
,
when
we
accompanied
her
to
the
Study
;
and
of
my
aunt
's
rubbing
her
nose
violently
,
by
the
way
,
as
a
mild
vent
for
her
intolerance
of
our
military
friend
;
but
who
got
first
into
the
Study
,
or
how
Mrs
Markleham
settled
herself
in
a
moment
in
her
easy
-
chair
,
or
how
my
aunt
and
I
came
to
be
left
together
near
the
door
(
unless
her
eyes
were
quicker
than
mine
,
and
she
held
me
back
)
<EOS>
,
I
have
forgotten
,
if
I
ever
knew
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
I
know
,
---
that
we
saw
the
Doctor
before
he
saw
us
,
sitting
at
his
table
,
among
the
folio
volumes
in
which
he
delighted
,
resting
his
head
calmly
on
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
in
the
same
moment
,
we
saw
Mrs
Strong
glide
in
,
pale
and
trembling
.
 
<EOS>
That
Mr
Dick
supported
her
on
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
laid
his
other
hand
upon
the
Doctor
's
arm
,
causing
him
to
look
up
with
an
abstracted
air
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
as
the
Doctor
moved
his
head
,
his
wife
dropped
down
on
one
knee
at
his
feet
,
and
,
with
her
hands
imploringly
lifted
,
fixed
upon
his
face
the
memorable
look
I
had
never
forgotten
.
 
<EOS>
That
at
this
sight
Mrs
Markleham
dropped
the
newspaper
,
and
stared
more
like
a
figure
-
head
intended
for
a
ship
to
be
called
The
Astonishment
,
than
anything
else
I
can
think
of
.
   
<EOS>
The
gentleness
of
the
Doctor
's
manner
and
surprise
,
the
dignity
that
mingled
with
the
supplicating
attitude
of
his
wife
,
the
amiable
concern
of
Mr
Dick
,
and
the
earnestness
with
which
my
aunt
said
to
herself
,
"
That
man
mad
!
"
<EOS>
(
triumphantly
expressive
of
the
misery
from
which
she
had
saved
him
)
---
I
see
and
hear
,
rather
than
remember
,
as
I
write
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Doctor
!
"
said
Mr
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
that
's
amiss
?
 
<EOS>
Look
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Annie
!
"
cried
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
at
my
feet
,
my
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
and
pray
that
no
one
will
leave
the
room
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
husband
and
father
,
break
this
long
silence
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
both
know
what
it
is
that
has
come
between
us
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Markleham
,
by
this
time
recovering
the
power
of
speech
,
and
seeming
to
swell
with
family
pride
and
motherly
indignation
,
here
exclaimed
,
"
Annie
,
get
up
immediately
,
and
do
n't
disgrace
everybody
belonging
to
you
by
humbling
yourself
like
that
,
unless
you
wish
to
see
me
go
out
of
my
mind
on
the
spot
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mama
!
"
returned
Annie
.
 
<EOS>
"
Waste
no
words
on
me
,
for
my
appeal
is
to
my
husband
,
and
even
you
are
nothing
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Markleham
.
 
<EOS>
"
Me
,
nothing
!
<EOS>
The
child
has
taken
leave
of
her
senses
.
 
<EOS>
Please
to
get
me
a
glass
of
water
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
too
attentive
to
the
Doctor
and
his
wife
,
to
give
any
heed
to
this
request
;
and
it
made
no
impression
on
anybody
else
;
so
Mrs
Markleham
panted
,
stared
,
and
fanned
herself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Annie
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
Doctor
,
tenderly
taking
her
in
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
!
 
<EOS>
If
any
unavoidable
change
has
come
,
in
the
sequence
of
time
,
upon
our
married
life
,
you
are
not
to
blame
.
 
<EOS>
The
fault
is
mine
,
and
only
mine
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
change
in
my
affection
,
admiration
,
and
respect
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
make
you
happy
.
 
<EOS>
I
truly
love
and
honour
you
.
<EOS>
Rise
,
Annie
,
pray
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
she
did
not
rise
.
 
<EOS>
After
looking
at
him
for
a
little
while
,
she
sank
down
closer
to
him
,
laid
her
arm
across
his
knee
,
and
dropping
her
head
upon
it
,
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
If
I
have
any
friend
here
,
who
can
speak
one
word
for
me
,
or
for
my
husband
in
this
matter
;
if
I
have
any
friend
here
,
who
can
give
a
voice
to
any
suspicion
that
my
heart
has
sometimes
whispered
to
me
;
if
I
have
any
friend
here
,
who
honours
my
husband
,
or
has
ever
cared
for
me
,
and
has
anything
within
his
knowledge
,
no
matter
what
it
is
,
that
may
help
to
mediate
between
us
,
I
implore
that
friend
to
speak
!
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
profound
silence
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
few
moments
of
painful
hesitation
,
I
broke
the
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Strong
,
"
I
said
,
"
there
is
something
within
my
knowledge
,
which
I
have
been
earnestly
entreated
by
Doctor
Strong
to
conceal
,
and
have
concealed
until
tonight
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
I
believe
the
time
has
come
when
it
would
be
mistaken
faith
and
delicacy
to
conceal
it
any
longer
,
and
when
your
appeal
absolves
me
from
his
injunction
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
turned
her
face
towards
me
for
a
moment
,
and
I
knew
that
I
was
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
resisted
its
entreaty
,
if
the
assurance
that
it
gave
me
had
been
less
convincing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Our
future
peace
,
"
she
said
,
"
may
be
in
your
hands
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
it
confidently
to
your
not
suppressing
anything
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
beforehand
that
nothing
you
,
or
anyone
,
can
tell
me
,
will
show
my
husband
's
noble
heart
in
any
other
light
than
one
.
 
<EOS>
Howsoever
<EOS>
it
may
seem
to
you
to
touch
me
,
disregard
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
speak
for
myself
,
before
him
,
and
before
God
afterwards
.
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
earnestly
besought
,
I
made
no
reference
to
the
Doctor
for
his
permission
,
but
,
without
any
other
compromise
of
the
truth
than
a
little
softening
of
the
coarseness
of
Uriah
Heep
,
related
plainly
what
had
passed
in
that
same
room
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
staring
of
Mrs
Markleham
during
the
whole
narration
,
and
the
shrill
,
sharp
interjections
with
which
she
occasionally
interrupted
it
,
defy
description
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
had
finished
,
Annie
remained
,
for
some
few
moments
,
silent
,
with
her
head
bent
down
,
as
I
have
described
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
she
took
the
Doctor
's
hand
(
he
was
sitting
in
the
same
attitude
as
when
we
had
entered
the
room
)
,
and
pressed
it
to
her
breast
,
and
kissed
it
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
softly
raised
her
;
and
she
stood
,
when
she
began
to
speak
,
leaning
on
him
,
and
looking
down
upon
her
husband
---
from
whom
she
never
turned
her
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
that
has
ever
been
in
my
mind
,
since
I
was
married
,
"
she
said
in
a
low
,
submissive
,
tender
voice
,
"
I
will
lay
bare
before
you
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
live
and
have
one
reservation
,
knowing
what
I
know
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Annie
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
mildly
,
"
I
have
never
doubted
you
,
my
child
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
need
;
indeed
there
is
no
need
,
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
great
need
,
"
she
answered
,
in
the
same
way
,
"
that
I
should
open
my
whole
heart
before
the
soul
of
generosity
and
truth
,
whom
,
year
by
year
,
and
day
by
day
,
I
have
loved
and
venerated
more
and
more
,
as
Heaven
knows
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
"
interrupted
Mrs
Markleham
,
"
if
I
have
any
discretion
at
all
---
"
   
(
"
Which
you
have
n't
,
you
Marplot
,
"
observed
my
aunt
,
in
an
indignant
whisper
.
)
   
<EOS>
---
"
I
must
be
permitted
to
observe
that
it
can
not
be
requisite
to
enter
into
these
details
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
one
but
my
husband
can
judge
of
that
,
mama
,
"
said
Annie
without
removing
her
eyes
from
his
face
,
"
and
he
will
hear
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
say
anything
to
give
you
pain
,
mama
,
forgive
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
borne
pain
first
,
often
and
long
,
myself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
!
"
gasped
Mrs
Markleham
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
was
very
young
,
"
said
Annie
,
"
quite
a
little
child
,
<EOS>
my
first
associations
with
knowledge
of
any
kind
were
inseparable
from
a
patient
friend
and
teacher
---
the
friend
of
my
dead
father
---
who
was
always
dear
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
remember
nothing
that
I
know
,
without
remembering
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
stored
my
mind
with
its
first
treasures
,
and
stamped
his
character
upon
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
They
never
could
have
been
,
I
think
,
as
good
as
they
have
been
to
me
,
if
I
had
taken
them
from
any
other
hands
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Makes
her
mother
nothing
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mrs
Markleham
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
so
mama
,
"
said
Annie
;
"
but
I
make
him
what
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
do
that
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
grew
up
,
he
occupied
the
same
place
still
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
proud
of
his
interest
:
<EOS>
deeply
,
fondly
,
gratefully
attached
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
looked
up
to
him
<EOS>
,
I
can
hardly
describe
how
---
as
a
father
,
as
a
guide
,
as
one
whose
praise
was
different
from
all
other
praise
,
as
one
in
whom
I
could
have
trusted
and
confided
,
if
I
had
doubted
all
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
,
mama
,
how
young
and
inexperienced
<EOS>
I
was
,
when
you
presented
him
before
me
,
of
a
sudden
,
as
a
lover
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
mentioned
the
fact
,
fifty
times
at
least
,
to
everybody
here
!
"
said
Mrs
Markleham
.
   
<EOS>
(
"
Then
hold
your
tongue
,
for
the
Lord
's
sake
,
and
do
n't
mention
it
any
more
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
my
aunt
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
so
great
a
change
:
so
great
a
loss
,
I
felt
it
,
at
first
,
"
said
Annie
,
still
preserving
the
same
look
and
tone
,
"
that
I
was
agitated
and
distressed
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
but
a
girl
;
and
when
so
great
a
change
came
in
the
character
in
which
I
had
so
long
looked
up
to
him
,
I
think
I
was
sorry
.
 
<EOS>
But
nothing
could
have
made
him
what
he
used
to
be
again
;
and
I
was
proud
that
he
should
think
me
so
worthy
,
and
we
were
married

"

At
Saint
Alphage

Canterbury
,

observed
Mrs
Markleham
.
   
<EOS>
(
"
Confound
the
woman
!
"
<EOS>
said
my
aunt
,
"
she
WON'T

<EOS>
"
I
never
thought

proceeded
Annie
,
with
a
heightened
colour
,
"
of
any
worldly
gain
that
my
husband
would
bring
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
young
heart
had
no
room
in
its
homage
for
any
such
poor
reference
.
 
<EOS>
Mama
,
forgive
me
when
I
say
that
it
was
you
who
first
presented
to
my
mind
the
thought
that
anyone
could
wrong
me
,
and
wrong
him
,
by
such
a
cruel
suspicion
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Me
!
"
cried
Mrs
Markleham
.
   
<EOS>
(
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
You
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>

observed
my
aunt

"

you
ca
n't
fan
it
away

my
military
friend

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
It
was
the
first
unhappiness
of
my
new
life

"
said
Annie
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
the
first
occasion
of
every
unhappy
moment
I
have
known
.
 
<EOS>
These
moments
have
been
more
,
of
late
,
than
I
can
count
;
but
not
---
my
generous
husband
!
<EOS>
---
not
for
the
reason
you
suppose
;
for
in
my
heart
there
is
not
a
thought
,
a
recollection
,
or
a
hope
,
that
any
power
could
separate
from
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
raised
her
eyes
,
and
clasped
her
hands
,
and
looked
as
beautiful
and
true
,
I
thought
,
as
any
Spirit
.
 
<EOS>
The
Doctor
looked
on
her
,
henceforth
,
as
steadfastly
as
she
on
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mama
is
blameless
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
of
having
ever
urged
you
for
herself
,
and
she
is
blameless
in
intention
every
way
,
I
am
sure
,
---
but
when
I
saw
how
many
importunate
claims
were
pressed
upon
you
in
my
name
;
how
you
were
traded
on
in
my
name
;
how
generous
you
were
,
and
how
Mr
Wickfield
,
who
had
your
welfare
very
much
at
heart
,
resented
it
;
the
first
sense
of
my
exposure
to
the
mean
suspicion
that
my
tenderness
was
bought
---
and
sold
to
you
,
of
all
men
on
earth
---
fell
upon
me
like
unmerited
disgrace
,
in
which
I
forced
you
to
participate
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
you
what
it
was
<EOS>

mama
can
not
imagine
what
it
was

to
have
this
dread
and
trouble
always
on
my
mind
,
yet
know
in
my
own
soul
that
on
my
marriage
-
day
I
crowned
the
love
and
honour
of
my
life
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
specimen
of
the
thanks
one
gets
,
"
cried
Mrs
Markleham
,
in
tears
,
"
for
taking
care
of
one
's
family
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
was
a
Turk
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
(
"
I
wish
you
were
,
with
all
my
heart
---
and
in
your
native
country
!

said
my
aunt
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
at
that
time
that
mama
was
most
solicitous
about
my
Cousin
Maldon
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
liked
him
"
:
she
spoke
softly
,
but
without
any
hesitation
:
"
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
been
little
lovers
once
.
 
<EOS>
If
circumstances
had
not
happened
otherwise
,
I
might
have
come
to
persuade
myself
that
I
really
loved
him
,
and
might
have
married
him
,
and
been
most
wretched
.
 
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
disparity
in
marriage
like
unsuitability
of
mind
and
purpose
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
pondered
on
those
words
,
even
while
I
was
studiously
attending
to
what
followed
,
as
if
they
had
some
particular
interest
,
or
some
strange
application
that
I
could
not
divine
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
can
be
no
disparity
in
marriage
like
unsuitability
of

<EOS>
---
"
no
disparity
in
marriage
like
unsuitability
of
mind
and
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
,
"
said
Annie
,
"
that
we
have
in
common
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
long
found
that
there
is
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
were
thankful
to
my
husband
for
no
more
,
instead
of
for
so
much
,
I
should
be
thankful
to
him
for
having
saved
me
from
the
first
mistaken
impulse
of
my
undisciplined
heart
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
stood
quite
still
,
before
the
Doctor
,
and
spoke
with
an
earnestness
that
thrilled
me
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
her
voice
was
just
as
quiet
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
he
was
waiting
to
be
the
object
of
your
munificence
,
so
freely
bestowed
for
my
sake
,
and
when
I
was
unhappy
in
the
mercenary
shape
I
was
made
to
wear
,
I
thought
it
would
have
become
him
better
to
have
worked
his
own
way
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
that
if
I
had
been
he
,
I
would
have
tried
to
do
it
,
at
the
cost
of
almost
any
hardship
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
thought
no
worse
of
him
,
until
the
night
of
his
departure
for
India
.
 
<EOS>
That
night
I
knew
he
had
a
false
and
thankless
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
a
double
meaning
,
then
,
in
Mr
Wickfield
's
scrutiny
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
perceived
,
for
the
first
time
,
the
dark
suspicion
that
shadowed
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Suspicion
,
Annie
!
"
said
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
your
mind
there
was
none
,
I
know
,
my
husband
!
"
<EOS>
she
returned
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
I
came
to
you
,
that
night
,
to
lay
down
all
my
load
of
shame
and
grief
,
and
knew
that
I
had
to
tell
that
,
underneath
your
roof
,
one
of
my
own
kindred
,
to
whom
you
had
been
a
benefactor
,
for
the
love
of
me
,
had
spoken
to
me
words
that
should
have
found
no
utterance
,
even
if
I
had
been
the
weak
and
mercenary
wretch
he
thought
me
---
my
mind
revolted
from
the
taint
the
very
tale
conveyed
.
 
<EOS>
It
died
upon
my
lips
,
and
from
that
hour
till
now
has
never
passed
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Markleham
,
with
a
short
groan
,
leaned
back
in
her
easy
-
chair
;
and
retired
behind
her
fan
,
as
if
she
were
never
coming
out
any
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
,
but
in
your
presence
,
interchanged
a
word
with
him
from
that
time
;
then
,
only
when
it
has
been
necessary
for
the
avoidance
of
this
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
Years
have
passed
since
he
knew
,
from
me
,
what
his
situation
here
was
.
 
<EOS>
The
kindnesses
you
have
secretly
done
for
his
advancement
,
and
then
disclosed
to
me
,
for
my
surprise
and
pleasure
,
have
been
,
you
will
believe
,
but
aggravations
of
the
unhappiness
and
burden
of
my
secret
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
sunk
down
gently
at
the
Doctor
's
feet
,
though
he
did
his
utmost
to
prevent
her
;
and
said
,
looking
up
,
tearfully
,
into
his
face
:
   
<EOS>
"
Do
not
speak
to
me
yet
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
say
a
little
more
!
 
<EOS>
Right
or
wrong
,
if
this
were
to
be
done
again
,
I
think
I
should
do
just
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
can
know
what
it
was
to
be
devoted
to
you
,
with
those
old
associations
;
to
find
that
anyone
could
be
so
hard
as
to
suppose
that
the
truth
of
my
heart
was
bartered
away
,
and
to
be
surrounded
by
appearances
confirming
that
belief
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
very
young
,
and
had
no
adviser
.
 
<EOS>
Between
mama
and
me
,
in
all
relating
to
you
,
there
was
a
wide
division
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
shrunk
into
myself
,
hiding
the
disrespect
I
had
undergone
,
it
was
because
I
honoured
you
so
much
,
and
so
much
wished
that
you
should
honour
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Annie
,
my
pure
heart
!
"
said
the
Doctor
,
"
my
dear
girl
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
little
more
!
<EOS>
a
very
few
words
more
!
 
<EOS>
I
used
to
think
there
were
so
many
whom
you
might
have
married
,
who
would
not
have
brought
such
charge
and
trouble
on
you
,
and
who
would
have
made
your
home
a
worthier
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
used
to
be
afraid
that
I
had
better
have
remained
your
pupil
,
and
almost
your
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
used
to
fear
that
I
was
so
unsuited
to
your
learning
and
wisdom
.
 
<EOS>
If
all
this
made
me
shrink
within
myself
(
as
indeed
it
did
)
,
when
I
had
that
to
tell
,
it
was
still
because
I
honoured
you
so
much
,
and
hoped
that
you
might
one
day
honour
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
day
has
shone
this
long
time
,
Annie
,
"
said
the
Doctor
,
"
and
can
have
but
<EOS>
one
long
night
,
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Another
word
!
 
<EOS>
I
afterwards
meant
---
steadfastly
meant
,
and
purposed
to
myself
---
to
bear
the
whole
weight
of
knowing
the
unworthiness
of
one
to
whom
you
had
been
so
good
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
a
last
word
,
dearest
and
best
of
friends
!
 
<EOS>
The
cause
of
the
late
change
in
you
,
which
I
have
seen
with
so
much
pain
and
sorrow
,
and
have
sometimes
referred
to
my
old
apprehension
---
at
other
times
to
lingering
suppositions
nearer
to
the
truth
---
has
been
made
clear
tonight
;
and
by
an
accident
I
have
also
come
to
know
,
tonight
,
the
full
measure
of
your
noble
trust
in
me
,
even
under
that
mistake
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
hope
that
any
love
and
duty
I
may
render
in
return
,
will
ever
make
me
worthy
of
your
priceless
confidence
;
but
with
all
this
knowledge
fresh
upon
me
,
I
can
lift
my
eyes
to
this
dear
face
,
revered
as
a
father
's
,
loved
as
a
husband
's
,
sacred
to
me
in
my
childhood
as
a
friend
's
,
and
solemnly
declare
that
in
my
lightest
thought
I
have
never
wronged
you
;
never
wavered
in
the
love
and
the
fidelity
I
owe
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
had
her
arms
around
the
Doctor
's
neck
,
and
he
leant
his
head
down
over
her
,
mingling
his
grey
hair
with
her
dark
brown
tresses
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
hold
me
to
your
heart
,
my
husband
!
 
<EOS>
Never
cast
me
out
!
 
<EOS>
Do
not
think
or
speak
of
disparity
between
us
,
for
there
is
none
,
except
in
all
my
many
imperfections
.
 
<EOS>
Every
succeeding
year
I
have
known
this
better
,
as
I
have
esteemed
you
more
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
take
me
to
your
heart
,
my
husband
,
for
my
love
was
founded
on
a
rock
,
and
it
endures
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
the
silence
that
ensued
,
my
aunt
walked
gravely
up
to
Mr
Dick
,
without
at
all
hurrying
herself
,
and
gave
him
a
hug
and
a
sounding
kiss
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
was
very
fortunate
,
with
a
view
to
his
credit
,
that
she
did
so
<EOS>
;
for
I
am
confident
that
I
detected
him
at
that
moment
in
the
act
of
making
preparations
to
stand
on
one
leg
,
as
an
appropriate
expression
of
delight
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
very
remarkable
man
,
Dick
!
"
said
my
aunt
,
with
an
air
of
unqualified
approbation
;
"
and
never
pretend
to
be
anything
else
,
for
I
know
better
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
,
my
aunt
pulled
him
by
the
sleeve
,
and
nodded
to
me
;
and
we
three
stole
quietly
out
of
the
room
,
and
came
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
settler
for
our
military
friend
,
at
any
rate
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
on
the
way
home
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
sleep
the
better
for
that
,
if
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
glad
of
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
was
quite
overcome
,
I
am
afraid
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
with
great

<EOS>
I
was
thinking
of
all
that
had
been
said
.
 
<EOS>
My
mind
was
still
running
on
some
of
the
expressions
used

There

we

Intelligence
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
been
married
,
if
I
may
trust
to
my
imperfect
memory
for
dates
,
about
a
year
or
so
,
when
one
evening
,
as
I
was
returning
from
a
solitary
walk
,
thinking
of
the
book
I
was
then
writing
---
for
my
success
had
steadily
increased
with
my
steady
application
,
and
I
was
engaged
at
that
time
upon
my
first
work
of
fiction
---
<EOS>
I
came
past
Mrs
Steerforth
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
often
passed
it
before
,
during
my
residence
in
that
neighbourhood
,
though
never
when
I
could
choose
another
road
.
 
<EOS>
Howbeit
,
it
did
sometimes
happen
that
it
was
not
easy
to
find
another
,
without
making
a
long
circuit
;
and
so
I
had
passed
that
way
,
upon
the
whole
,
pretty
often
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
never
done
more
than
glance
at
the
house
,
as
I
went
by
with
a
quickened
step
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
uniformly
gloomy
and
dull
.
 
<EOS>
None
of
the
best
rooms
abutted
on
the
road
;
and
the
narrow
,
heavily
-
framed
old
-
fashioned
windows
,
never
cheerful
under
any
circumstances
,
looked
very
dismal
,
close
shut
,
and
with
their
blinds
always
drawn
down
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
covered
way
across
a
little
paved
court
,
to
an
entrance
that
was
never
used
;
and
there
was
one
round
staircase
window
,
at
odds
with
all
the
rest
,
and
<EOS>
the
only
one
unshaded
by
a
blind
,
which
had
the
same
unoccupied
blank
look
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
that
I
ever
saw
a
light
in
all
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
a
casual
passer
-
by
,
I
should
have
probably
supposed
that
some
childless
person
lay
dead
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
happily
possessed
no
knowledge
of
the
place
,
and
had
seen
it
often
in
that
changeless
state
,
I
should
have
pleased
my
fancy
with
many
ingenious
speculations
,
I
dare
say
.
   
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
I
thought
as
little
of
it
as
I
might
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
mind
could
not
go
by
it
and
leave
it
,
as
my
body
did
;
and
it
usually
awakened
a
long
train
of
meditations
.
 
<EOS>
Coming
before
me
,
on
this
particular
evening
that
I
mention
,
mingled
with
the
childish
recollections
and
later
fancies
,
the
ghosts
of
half
-
formed
hopes
,
the
broken
shadows
of
disappointments
dimly
seen
and
understood
,
the
blending
of
experience
and
imagination
,
incidental
to
the
occupation
with
which
my
thoughts
had
been
busy
,
it
was
more
than
commonly
suggestive
.
<EOS>
I
fell
into
a
brown
study
as
I
walked
on
,
and
a
voice
at
my
side
made
me
start
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
woman
's
voice
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
long
in
recollecting
Mrs
Steerforth
's
little
parlour
-
maid
,
who
had
formerly
worn
blue
ribbons
in
her
cap
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
taken
them
out
now
,
to
adapt
herself
,
I
suppose
,
to
the
altered
character
of
the
house
;
and
wore
but
one
or
two
disconsolate
bows
of
sober
brown
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
sir
,
would
you
have
the
goodness
to
walk
in
,
and
speak
to
Miss
Dartle
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Has
Miss
Dartle
sent
you
for
me
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
tonight
,
sir
,
but
it
's
just
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Dartle
saw
you
pass
a
night
or
two
ago
;
and
I
was
to
sit
at
work
on
the
staircase
,
and
when
I
saw
you
pass
again
,
to
ask
you
to
step
in
and
speak
to
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
turned
back
,
and
inquired
of
my
conductor
,
as
we
went
along
,
how
Mrs
Steerforth
was
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
her
lady
was
but
poorly
,
and
kept
her
own
room
a
good
deal
.
   
<EOS>
When
we
arrived
at
the
house
,
I
was
directed
to
Miss
Dartle
in
the
garden
,
and
left
to
make
my
presence
known
to
her
myself
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
sitting
on
a
seat
at
one
end
of
a
kind
of
terrace
,
overlooking
the
great
city
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
sombre
evening
,
with
a
lurid
light
in
the
sky
;
and
as
I
saw
the
prospect
scowling
in
the
distance
,
with
here
and
there
some
larger
object
starting
up
into
the
sullen
glare
,
I
fancied
it
was
no
inapt
companion
to
the
memory
of
this
fierce
woman
.
   
<EOS>
She
saw
me
as
I
advanced
,
and
rose
for
a
moment
to
receive
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
her
,
then
,
still
more
colourless
and
thin
than
when
I
had
seen
her
last
;
the
flashing
eyes
still
brighter
,
and
the
scar
still
plainer
.
   
<EOS>
Our
meeting
was
not
cordial
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
parted
angrily
on
the
last
occasion
;
and
there
was
an
air
of
disdain
about
her
,
which
she
took
no
pains
to
conceal
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
told
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
,
Miss
Dartle
,
"
said
I
,
standing
near
her
,
with
my
hand
upon
the
back
of
the
seat
,
and
declining
her
gesture
of
invitation
to
sit
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
has
this
girl
been
found
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
she
has
run
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
saw
her
thin
lips
working
while
she
looked
at
me
,
as
if
they
were
eager
to
load
her
with
reproaches
.
   
<EOS>
"
Run
away
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
From
him
,
"
she
said
,
with
a
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
she
is
not
found
,
perhaps
she
never
will
be
found
.
 
<EOS>
She
may
be
dead
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
vaunting
cruelty
with
which
she
met
my
glance
<EOS>
,
I
never
saw
expressed
in
any
other
face
that
ever
I
have
seen
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
wish
her
dead
,
"
said
I
,
"
may
be
the
kindest
wish
that
one
of
her
own
sex
could
bestow
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
that
time
has
softened
you
so
much
,
Miss
Dartle
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
condescended
to
make
no
reply
,
but
,
turning
on
me
with
another
scornful
laugh
,
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
The
friends
of
this
excellent
and
much
-
injured
young
lady
are
friends
of
yours
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
their
champion
,
and
assert
their
rights
.
<EOS>
Do
you
wish
to
know
what
is
known
of
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
<EOS>
I.
   
She
rose
with
an
ill
-
favoured
smile
,
and
taking
a
few
steps
towards
a
wall
of
holly
that
was
near
at
hand
,
dividing
the
lawn
from
a
kitchen
-
garden
,
said
,
in
a
louder
voice
,
"
Come
here
!
"
<EOS>
---
as
if
she
were
calling
to
some
unclean
beast
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
restrain
any
demonstrative
championship
or
vengeance
in
this
place
,
of
course
,
Mr
Copperfield
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
looking
over
her
shoulder
at
me
with
the
same
expression
.
   
<EOS>
I
inclined
my
head
,
without
knowing
what
she
meant
;
and
she
said
,
"
Come
here
!
"
<EOS>
again
;
and
returned
,
followed
by
the
respectable
Mr
Littimer
,
who
,
with
undiminished
respectability
,
made
me
a
bow
,
and
took
up
his
position
behind
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
air
of
wicked
grace
:
of
triumph
,
in
which
,
strange
to
say
,
there
was
yet
something
feminine
and
alluring
:
with
which
she
reclined
upon
the
seat
between
us
,
and
looked
at
me
,
was
worthy
of
a
cruel
Princess
in
a
Legend
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
she
,
imperiously
,
without
glancing
at
him
,
and
touching
the
old
wound
as
it
throbbed
:
perhaps
,
in
this
instance
,
with
pleasure
rather
than
pain
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
Mr
Copperfield
about
the
flight
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
James
and
myself
,
ma'am
---
"
   
"
Do
n't
address
yourself
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
interrupted
with
a
frown
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
James
and
myself
,
sir
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
Nor
to
me
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
I.
   
Mr
Littimer
,
without
being
at
all
discomposed
,
signified
by
a
slight
obeisance
,
that
anything
that
was
most
agreeable
to
us
was
most
agreeable
to
him
;
and
began
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
James
and
myself
have
been
abroad
with
the
young
woman
,
ever
since
she
left
Yarmouth
under
Mr
james
's
protection
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
been
in
a
variety
of
places
,
and
seen
a
deal
of
foreign
country
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
been
in
France
,
Switzerland
,
Italy
,
in
fact
,
almost
all
parts
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
looked
at
the
back
of
the
seat
,
as
if
he
were
addressing
himself
to
that
;
and
softly
played
upon
it
with
his
hands
,
as
if
he
were
striking
chords
upon
a
dumb
piano
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
James
took
quite
uncommonly
to
the
young
woman
;
and
was
more
settled
,
for
a
length
of
time
,
than
I
have
known
him
to
be
since
I
have
been
in
his
service
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
woman
was
very
improvable
,
and
spoke
the
languages
;
and
would
n't
have
been
known
for
the
same
country
-
person
.
 
<EOS>
I
noticed
that
she
was
much
admired
wherever
we
went
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Dartle
put
her
hand
upon
her
side
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
him
steal
a
glance
at
her
,
and
slightly
smile
to
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
much
admired
,
indeed
,
the
young
woman
was
.
 
<EOS>
What
with
her
dress
;
<EOS>
what
with
the
air
and
sun
;
<EOS>
what
with
being
made
so
much
of
;
what
with
this
,
that
,
and
the
other
;
her
merits
really
attracted
general
notice
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
made
a
short
pause
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eyes
wandered
restlessly
over
the
distant
prospect
,
and
she
bit
her
nether
lip
to
stop
that
busy
mouth
.
   
<EOS>
Taking
his
hands
from
the
seat
,
and
placing
one
of
them
within
the
other
,
as
he
settled
himself
on
one
leg
,
Mr
Littimer
proceeded
,
with
his
eyes
cast
down
,
and
his
respectable
head
a
little
advanced
,
and
a
little
on
one
side
:
   
<EOS>
"
The
young
woman
went
on
in
this
manner
for
some
time
,
being
occasionally
low
in
her
spirits
,
until
I
think
she
began
to
weary
Mr
James
by
giving
way
to
her
low
spirits
and
tempers
of
that
kind
;
and
things
were
not
so
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
James
he
began
to
be
restless
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
restless
he
got
,
the
worse
she
got
;
and
I
must
say
,
for
myself
,
that
I
had
a
very
difficult
time
of
it
indeed
between
the
two
.
 
<EOS>
Still
matters
were
patched
up
here
,
and
made
good
there
,
over
and
over
again
;
and
altogether
lasted
,
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
for
a
longer
time
than
anybody
could
have
expected
.
"
   
<EOS>
Recalling
her
eyes
from
the
distance
,
she
looked
at
me
again
now
,
with
her
former
air
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Littimer
,
clearing
his
throat
behind
his
hand
with
a
respectable
short
cough
,
changed
legs
,
and
went
on
:
   
"
<EOS>
At
last
,
when
there
had
been
,
upon
the
whole
,
a
good
many
words
and
reproaches
,
Mr
James
he
set
off
one
morning
,
from
the
neighbourhood
of
Naples
,
where
we
had
a
villa
(
the
young
woman
being
very
partial
to
the
sea
)
,
and
,
under
pretence
of
coming
back
in
a
day
or
so
,
left
it
in
charge
with
me
to
break
it
out
,
that
,
for
the
general
happiness
of
all
concerned
,
he
was
"
---
here
an
interruption
of
the
short
cough
---
"
gone
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
James
,
I
must
say
,
certainly
did
behave
extremely
honourable
;
for
he
proposed
that
the
young
woman
should
marry
a
very
respectable
person
,
who
was
fully
prepared
to
overlook
the
past
,
and
who
was
,
at
least
,
as
good
as
anybody
the
young
woman
could
have
aspired
to
in
a
regular
way
:
<EOS>
her
connexions
being
very
common
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
changed
legs
again
,
and
wetted
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
convinced
that
the
scoundrel
spoke
of
himself
,
and
I
saw
my
conviction
reflected
in
Miss
Dartle
's
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
I
also
had
it
in
charge
to
communicate
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
willing
to
do
anything
to
relieve
Mr
James
from
his
difficulty
,
and
to
restore
harmony
between
himself
and
an
affectionate
parent
,
who
has
undergone
so
much
on
his
account
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
undertook
the
commission
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
woman

violence
when
she
came
to
,
after
I
broke
the
fact
of
his
departure
,
was
beyond
all
expectations
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
quite
mad
,
and
had
to
be
held
by
force
;
or
,
if
she
could
n't
have
got
to
a
knife
,
or
got
to
the
sea
,
she
'd
have
beaten
her
head
against
the
marble
floor
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Dartle
,
leaning
back
upon
the
seat
,
with
a
light
of
exultation
in
her
face
,
seemed
almost
to
caress
the
sounds
this
fellow
had
uttered
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
when
I
came
to
the
second
part
of
what
had
been
entrusted
to
me
,
"
said
Mr
Littimer
,
rubbing
his
hands
uneasily
,
"
which
anybody
might
have
supposed
would
have
been
,
at
all
events
,
appreciated
as
a
kind
intention
<EOS>
,
then
the
young
woman
came
out
in
her
true
colours
.
 
<EOS>
A
more
outrageous
person
I
never
did
see
.
 
<EOS>
Her
conduct
was
surprisingly
bad
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
no
more
gratitude
,
no
more
feeling
,
no
more
patience
,
no
more
reason
in
her
,
than
a
stock
or
a
stone
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
n't
been
upon
my
guard
,
I
am
convinced
she
would
have
had
my
blood
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
the
better
of
her
for
it
,
"
said
I
,
indignantly
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Littimer
bent
his
head
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
Indeed
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
But
you
're
young
!
"
and
resumed
his
narrative
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
necessary
,
in
short
,
for
a
time
,
to
take
away
everything
nigh
her
,
that
she
could
do
herself
,
or
anybody
else
,
an
injury
with
,
and
to
shut
her
up
close
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
which
,
she
got
out
in
the
night
;
forced
the
lattice
of
a
window
,
that
I
had
nailed
up
myself
;
dropped
on
a
vine
that
was
trailed
below
;
and
never
has
been
seen
or
heard
of
,
to
my
knowledge
,
since
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
dead
,
perhaps
,
"
said
Miss
Dartle
,
with
a
smile
,
as
if
she
could
have
spurned
the
body
of
the
ruined
girl
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
may
have
drowned
herself
,
miss
,
"
returned
Mr
Littimer
,
catching
at
an
excuse
for
addressing
himself
to
somebody
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Or
,
she
may
have
had
assistance
from
the
boatmen
,
and
the
boatmen
's
wives
and
children
.
 
<EOS>
Being
given
to
low
company
,
she
was
very
much
in
the
habit
of
talking
to
them
on
the
beach
,
Miss
Dartle
,
and
sitting
by
their
boats
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
known
her
do
it
,
when
Mr
James
has
been
away
,
whole
days
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
James
was
far
from
pleased
to
find
out
,
once
,
that
she
had
told
the
children
she
was
a
boatman
's
daughter
,
and
that
in
her
own
country
,
long
ago
,
she
had
roamed
about
the
beach
,
like
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oh
,
Emily
!
<EOS>
Unhappy
beauty
!
<EOS>
What
a
picture
rose
before
me
of
her
sitting
on
the
far
-
off
shore
,
among
the
children
like
herself
when
she
was
innocent
,
listening
to
little
voices
such
as
might
have
called
her
Mother
<EOS>
had
she
been
a
poor
man
's
wife
;
and
to
the
great
voice
of
the
sea
,
with
its
eternal
"
Never
more
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
it
was
clear
that
nothing
could
be
done
,
Miss
Dartle
---
"
   
"
Did
I
tell
you
not
to
speak
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
with
stern
contempt
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
spoke
to
me
,
miss
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
my
service
to
obey
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
your
service
,
"
she
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
Finish
your
story
,
and
go
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
it
was
clear
,
"
he
said
,
with
infinite
respectability
and
an
obedient
bow
,
"
that
she
was
not
to
be
found
<EOS>
,
I
went
to
Mr
James
,
at
the
place
where
it
had
been
agreed
that
I
should
write
to
him
,
and
informed
him
of
what
had
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
Words
passed
between
us
in
consequence
,
and
I
felt
it
due
to
my
character
to
leave
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
bear
,
and
I
have
borne
,
a
great
deal
from
Mr
James
;
but
he
insulted
me
too
far
.
 
<EOS>
He
hurt
me
.
 
<EOS>
Knowing
the
unfortunate
difference
between
himself
and
his
mother
,
and
what
her
anxiety
of
mind
was
likely
to
be
,
I
took
the
liberty
of
coming
home
to
England
,
and
relating
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
For
money
which
I
paid
him
,
"
said
Miss
Dartle
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
so
,
ma'am
---
and
relating
what
I
knew
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
aware
,
"
said
Mr
Littimer
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
,
"
that
there
is
anything
else
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
at
present
out
of
employment
,
and
should
be
happy
to
meet
with
a
respectable
situation
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Dartle
glanced
at
me
,
as
though
she
would
inquire
if
there
were
anything
that
I
desired
to
ask
.
 
<EOS>
As
there
was
something
which
had
occurred
to
my
mind
,
I
said
in
reply
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
wish
to
know
from
this
---
creature
,
"
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
utter
any
more
conciliatory
word
,
"
whether
they
intercepted
a
letter
that
was
written
to
her
from
home
,
or
whether
he
supposes
that
she
received
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
remained
calm
and
silent
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
,
and
the
tip
of
every
finger
of
his
right
hand
delicately
poised
against
the
tip
of
every
finger
of
his
left
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Dartle
turned
her
head
disdainfully
towards
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
miss
,
"
he
said
,
awakening
from
his
abstraction
,
"
but
,
however
submissive
to
you
,
<EOS>
I
have
my
position
,
though
a
servant
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
and
you
,
miss
,
are
different
people
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mr
Copperfield
wishes
to
know
anything
from
me
,
I
take
the
liberty
of
reminding
Mr
Copperfield
that
he
can
put
a
question
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
character
to
maintain
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
momentary
struggle
with
myself
,
I
turned
my
eyes
upon
him
,
and
said
,
"
You
have
heard
my
question
.
 
<EOS>
Consider
it
addressed
to
yourself
,
if
you
choose
.
 
<EOS>
What
answer
do
you
make
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
he
rejoined
,
with
an
occasional
separation
and
reunion
of
those
delicate
tips
,
"
my
answer
must
be
qualified
;
because
,
to
betray
Mr
james
's
confidence
to
his
mother
,
and
to
betray
it
to
you
,
are
two
different
actions
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
probable
,
I
consider
,
that
Mr
James
would
encourage
the
receipt
of
letters
likely
to
increase
low
spirits
and
unpleasantness
;
but
<EOS>
further
than
that
,
sir
,
I
should
wish
to
avoid
going
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Miss
Dartle
of
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
indicated
that
I
had
nothing
more
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
Except
,
"
I
added
,
as
I
saw
him
moving
off
,
"
that
I
understand
this
fellow
's
part
in
the
wicked
story
,
and
that
,
as
I
shall
make
it
known
to
the
honest
man
who
has
been
her
father
from
her
childhood
,
I
would
recommend
him
to
avoid
going
too
much
into
public
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
stopped
the
moment
I
began
,
and
had
listened
with
his
usual
repose
of
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
'll
excuse
me
if
I
say
,
sir
,
that
there
are
neither
slaves
nor
slave
-
drivers
in
this
country
,
and
that
people
are
not
allowed
to
take
the
law
into
their
own
hands
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
do
,
it
is
more
to
their
own
peril
,
I
believe
,
than
to
other
people
's
.
 
<EOS>
Consequently
speaking
,
I
am
not
at
all
afraid
of
going
wherever
I
may
wish
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
made
a
polite
bow
;
and
,
with
another
to
Miss
Dartle
,
went
away
through
the
arch
in
the
wall
of
holly
by
which
he
had
come
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Dartle
<EOS>
and
I
regarded
each
other
for
a
little
while
in
silence
;
her
manner
being
exactly
what
it
was
,
when
she
had
produced
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
says
besides
,
"
she
observed
,
with
a
slow
curling
of
her
lip
,
"
that
his
master
,
as
he
hears
,
is
coasting
Spain
;
and
this
done
,
is
away
to
gratify
his
seafaring
tastes
till
he
is
weary
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
is
of
no
interest
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Between
these
two
proud
persons
,
mother
and
son
,
there
is
a
wider
breach
than
before
,
and
little
hope
of
its
healing
,
for
they
are
one
at
heart
,
and
time
makes
each
more
obstinate
and
imperious
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
is
this
of
any
interest
to
you
;
but
it
introduces
what
I
wish
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
This
devil
whom
you
make
an
angel
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
this
low
girl
whom
he
picked
out
of
the
tide
-
mud
,
"
with
her
black
eyes
full
upon
me
,
and
her
passionate
finger
up
,
"
may
be
alive
,
---
<EOS>
for
I
believe
some
common
things
are
hard
to
die
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
is
,
you
will
desire
to
have
a
pearl
of
such
price
found
and
taken
care
of
.
 
<EOS>
We
desire
that
,
too
;
that
he
may
not
by
any
chance
be
made
her
prey
again
.
 
<EOS>
So
far
,
we
are
united
in
one
interest
;
and
that
is
why
I
,
who
would
do
her
any
mischief
that
so
coarse
<EOS>
a
wretch
is
capable
of
feeling
,
have
sent
for
you
to
hear
what
you
have
heard
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
saw
,
by
the
change
in
her
face
,
that
someone
was
advancing
behind
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Mrs
Steerforth
,
who
gave
me
her
hand
more
coldly
than
of
yore
,
and
with
an
augmentation
of
her
former
stateliness
of
manner
,
but
still
,
I
perceived
---
<EOS>
and
I
was
touched
by
it
---
with
an
ineffaceable
remembrance
of
my
old
love
for
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
greatly
altered
.
 
<EOS>
Her
fine
figure
was
far
less
upright
,
her
handsome
face
was
deeply
marked
,
and
her
hair
was
almost
white
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
sat
down
on
the
seat
,
she
was
a
handsome
lady
still
;
and
well
I
knew
the
bright
eye
with
its
lofty
look
,
that
had
been
a
light
in
my
very
dreams
at
school
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
informed
of
everything
,
Rosa
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
has
he
heard
Littimer
himself
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
have
told
him
why
you
wished
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
good
girl
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
some
slight
correspondence
with
your
former
friend
,
sir
,
"
addressing
me
,
"
but
it
has
not
restored
his
sense
of
duty
or
natural
obligation
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
have
no
other
object
in
this
,
than
what
Rosa
has
mentioned
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
by
the
course
which
may
relieve
the
mind
of
the
decent
man
you
brought
here
(
for
whom
I
am
sorry
---
I
can
say
no
more
)
,
my
son
may
be
saved
from
again
falling
into
the
snares
of
a
designing
enemy
,
well
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
drew
herself
up
,
and
sat
looking
straight
before
her
,
far
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
<EOS>
I
said
respectfully
,
"
I
understand
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
am
in
no
danger
of
putting
any
strained
construction
on
your
motives
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
say
,
even
to
you
,
having
known
this
injured
family
from
childhood
,
that
if
you
suppose
the
girl
,
so
deeply
wronged
,
has
not
been
cruelly
deluded
,
and
would
not
rather
die
a
hundred
deaths
than
take
a
cup
of
water
from
your
son
's
hand
now
,
you
cherish
a
terrible
mistake
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Rosa
,
well
!
"
said
Mrs
Steerforth
,
<EOS>
as
the
other
was
about
to
interpose
,
"
it
is
no
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Let
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
married
,
sir
,
I
am
told
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
answered
that
I
had
been
some
time
married
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
are
doing
well
?
 
<EOS>
I
hear
little
in
the
quiet
life
I
lead
,
but
I
understand
you
are
beginning
to
be
famous
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
very
fortunate
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
find
my
name
connected
with
some
praise
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
mother
?
"
<EOS>
---
in
a
softened
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
pity
,
"
she
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
would
have
been
proud
of
you
.
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
took
the
hand
she
held
out
with
a
dignified
,
unbending
air
,
and
it
was
as
calm
in
mine
as
if
her
breast
had
been
at
peace
.
 
<EOS>
Her
pride
could
still
its
very
pulses
,
it
appeared
,
and
draw
the
placid
veil
before
her
face
,
through
which
she
sat
looking
straight
before
her
on
the
far
distance
.
   
<EOS>
As
I
moved
away
from
them
along
the
terrace
,
I
could
not
help
observing
how
steadily
they
both
sat
gazing
on
the
prospect
,
and
how
it
thickened
and
closed
around
them
.
 
<EOS>
Here
and
there
,
some
early
lamps
were
seen
to
twinkle
in
the
distant
city
;
and
in
the
eastern
quarter
of
the
sky
the
lurid
light
still
hovered
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
from
the
greater
part
of
the
broad
valley
interposed
,
a
mist
was
rising
like
a
sea
,
which
,
mingling
with
the
darkness
,
made
it
seem
as
if
the
gathering
waters
would
encompass
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
remember
this
,
and
think
of
it
with
awe
;
for
before
I
looked
upon
those
two
again
,
a
stormy
sea
had
risen
to
their
feet
.
   
<EOS>
Reflecting
on
what
had
been
thus
told
me
,
I
felt
it
right
that
it
should
be
communicated
to
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
following
evening
I
went
into
London
in
quest
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
always
wandering
about
from
place
to
place
,
with
his
one
object
of
recovering
his
niece
before
him
;
but
was
more
in
London
than
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
Often
and
often
,
now
,
had
I
seen
him
in
the
dead
of
night
passing
along
the
streets
,
searching
,
among
the
few
who
loitered
out
of
doors
at
those
untimely
hours
,
for
what
he
dreaded
to
find
.
   
<EOS>
He
kept
a
lodging
over
the
little
chandler
's
shop
in
Hungerford
Market
,
which
I
have
had
occasion
to
mention
more
than
once
,
and
from
which
he
first
went
forth
upon
his
errand
of
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
Hither
I
directed
my
walk
.
 
<EOS>
On
making
inquiry
for
him
,
I
learned
from
the
people
of
the
house
that
he
had
not
gone
out
yet
,
and
I
should
find
him
in
his
room
upstairs
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
sitting
reading
by
a
window
in
which
he
kept
a
few
plants
.
<EOS>
The
room
was
very
neat
and
orderly
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
in
a
moment
that
it
was
always
kept
prepared
for
her
reception
,
and
that
he
never
went
out
<EOS>
but
he
thought
it
possible
he
might
bring
her
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
heard
my
tap
at
the
door
,
and
only
raised
his
eyes
when
I
laid
my
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mas'r
Davy
!
<EOS>
Thankee
,
sir
!
<EOS>
thankee
hearty
,
for
this
visit
!
<EOS>
Sit
ye
down
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
kindly
welcome
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
said
I
,
taking
the
chair
he
handed
me
,
"
do
n't
expect
much
!
<EOS>
I
have
heard
some
news
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Of
Em'ly
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
put
his
hand
,
in
a
nervous
manner
,
on
his
mouth
,
and
turned
pale
,
as
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
mine
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
gives
no
clue
to
where
she
is
;
but
she
is
not
with
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
sat
down
,
looking
intently
at
me
,
and
listened
in
profound
silence
to
all
I
had
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
I
well
remember
the
sense
of
dignity
,
beauty
even
,
with
which
the
patient
gravity
of
his
face
impressed
me
,
when
,
having
gradually
removed
his
eyes
from
mine
,
he
sat
looking
downward
,
leaning
his
forehead
on
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
offered
no
interruption
,
but
remained
throughout
perfectly
still
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
pursue
her
figure
through
the
narrative
,
and
to
let
every
other
shape
go
by
him
,
as
if
it
were
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
had
done
,
he
shaded
his
face
,
and
continued
silent
.
 
<EOS>
I
looked
out
of
the
window
for
a
little
while
,
and
occupied
myself
with
the
plants
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
fare
to
feel
about
it
,
Mas'r
Davy
?
<EOS>
"
he
inquired
at
length
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
she
is
living
,
"
I
replied
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
doen't
know
.
 
<EOS>
Maybe
the
first
shock
was
too
rough
,
and
in
the
wildness
of
her
art
---
!
<EOS>
That
there
blue
water
as
she
used
to
speak
on
.
 
<EOS>
Could
she
have
thowt
o
'
<EOS>
that
so
many
year
,
because
it
was
to
be
her
grave
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
said
this
,
musing
,
in
a
low
,
frightened
voice
;
and
walked
across
the
little
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
,
"
he
added
,
"
Mas'r
Davy
,
I
have
felt
so
sure
as
she
was
living
<EOS>
---
I
have
know'd
,
awake
and
sleeping
,
as
it
was
so
trew
that
I
should
find
her
<EOS>
---
I
have
been
so
led
on
by
it
,
and
held
up
by
it
---
<EOS>
that
I
doen't
believe
I
can
have
been
deceived
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
Em'ly
's
alive
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
put
his
hand
down
firmly
on
the
table
,
and
set
his
sunburnt
face
into
a
resolute
expression
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
niece
,
Em'ly
,
is
alive
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
steadfastly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
doen't
know
wheer
it
comes
from
,
or
how
'
tis
,
but
I
am
told
as
she
's
alive
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
looked
almost
like
a
man
inspired
,
as
he
said
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
waited
for
a
few
moments
,
until
he
could
give
me
his
undivided
attention
;
and
then
proceeded
to
explain
the
precaution
,
that
,
it
had
occurred
to
me
last
night
,
it
would
be
wise
to
take
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
dear
friend
---
"
I
began
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thankee
,
thankee
,
kind
sir
,
"
he
said
,
grasping
my
hand
in
both
of
his
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
she
should
make
her
way
to
London
,
which
is
likely
---
for
where
could
she
lose
herself
so
readily
as
in
this
vast
city
;
and
what
would
she
wish
to
do
,
but
lose
and
hide
herself
,
if
she
does
not
go
home
?
 
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
And
she
wo
n't
go
home
<EOS>
,
"
he
interposed
,
shaking
his
head
mournfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
she
had
left
of
her
own
accord
,
she
might
;
not
as
It
was
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
she
should
come
here
,
"
said
I
,
"
I
believe
there
is
one
person
,
here
,
more
likely
to
discover
her
than
any
other
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
---
hear
what
I
say
,
with
fortitude
---
think
of
your
great
object
!
<EOS>
---
do
you
remember
Martha
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
our
town
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
needed
no
other
answer
than
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
that
she
is
in
London
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
her
in
the
streets
,
"
he
answered
,
with
a
shiver
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
n't
know
,
"
said
I
,
"
that
Emily
was
charitable
to
her
,
with
Ham
's
help
,
long
before
she
fled
from
home
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
,
that
,
when
we
met
one
night
,
and
spoke
together
in
the
room
yonder
,
over
the
way
,
she
listened
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mas'r
Davy
!
"
<EOS>
he
replied
in
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
night
when
it
snew
so
hard
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
That
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
seen
her
since
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
back
,
after
parting
from
you
,
to
speak
to
her
,
but
she
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
unwilling
to
mention
her
to
you
then
,
and
I
am
now
;
but
she
is
the
person
of
whom
I
speak
,
and
with
whom
I
think
we
should
communicate
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Too
well
,
sir
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
sunk
our
voices
,
almost
to
a
whisper
,
and
continued
to
speak
in
that
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
say
you
have
seen
her
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
that
you
could
find
her
?
<EOS>
I
could
only
hope
to
do
so
by
chance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
I
know
wheer
to
look
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
dark
.
 
<EOS>
Being
together
,
shall
we
go
out
now
,
and
try
to
find
her
tonight
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
assented
,
and
prepared
to
accompany
me
.
 
<EOS>
Without
appearing
to
observe
what
he
was
doing
,
I
saw
how
carefully
he
adjusted
the
little
room
,
put
a
candle
ready
and
<EOS>
the
means
of
lighting
it
,
arranged
the
bed
,
and
finally
took
out
of
a
drawer
one
of
her
dresses
(
I
remember
to
have
seen
her
wear
it
)
,
neatly
folded
with
some
other
garments
,
and
a
bonnet
,
which
he
placed
upon
a
chair
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
allusion
to
these
clothes
,
neither
did
<EOS>
I.
 
<EOS>
There
they
had
been
waiting
for
her
,
many
and
many
a
night
,
no
doubt
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
time
was
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
he
said
,
as
we
came
downstairs
,
"
when
I
thowt
this
girl
,
Martha
,
a'most
like
the
dirt
underneath
my
Em'ly
's
feet
.
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
me
,
theer
's
a
difference
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
we
went
along
,
partly
to
hold
him
in
conversation
,
and
partly
to
satisfy
myself
,
I
asked
him
about
Ham
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
almost
in
the
same
words
as
formerly
,
that
Ham
was
just
the
same
,
"
wearing
away
his
life
with
kiender
no
care
nohow
for
'
t
;
but
never
murmuring
,
and
liked
by
all
"
.
   
<EOS>
I
asked
him
what
he
thought
Ham
's
state
of
mind
was
,
in
reference
to
the
cause
of
their
misfortunes
?
 
<EOS>
Whether
he
believed
it
was
dangerous
?
 
<EOS>
What
he
supposed
,
for
example
,
Ham
would
do
,
if
he
and
Steerforth
ever
should
encounter
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
doen't
know
,
sir
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
thowt
of
it
oftentimes
,
but
I
ca
n't
awize
myself
of
it
,
no
matters
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
recalled
to
his
remembrance
the
morning
after
her
departure
,
when
we
were
all
three
on
the
beach
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
recollect
,
"
said
I
,
"
a
certain
wild
way
in
which
he
looked
out
to
sea
,
and
spoke
about
"
the
end
of
it
"
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sure
I
do
!
"
said
he
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
suppose
he
meant
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
he
replied
,
"
I
've
put
the
question
to
myself
a
mort
<EOS>
o
'
times
,
and
never
found
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
And
theer
's
one
curious
thing
---
<EOS>
that
,
though
he
is
so
pleasant
,
I
would
n't
fare
to
feel
comfortable
to
try
and
get
his
mind
upon
'
t.
 
<EOS>
He
never
said
a
wured
to
me
as
warn't
<EOS>
as
dootiful
as
dootiful
could
be
,
and
it
ai
n't
likely
as
he
'd
begin
to
speak
any
other
ways
now
;
but
it
's
fur
from
being
fleet
water
in
his
mind
,
where
them
thowts
lays
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
deep
,
sir
,
and
I
ca
n't
see
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
"
said
I
,
"
and
that
has
sometimes
made
me
anxious
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
me
too
,
Mas'r
Davy
<EOS>
,
"
he
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
Even
more
so
,
I
do
assure
you
,
than
his
ventersome
ways
,
though
both
belongs
to
the
alteration
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
doen't
know
as
he
'd
do
violence
under
any
circumstances
,
but
I
hope
as
them
two
may
be
kep
asunders
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
had
come
,
through
Temple
Bar
,
into
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
Conversing
no
more
now
,
and
walking
at
my
side
,
he
yielded
himself
up
to
the
one
aim
of
his
devoted
life
,
and
went
on
,
with
that
hushed
concentration
of
his
faculties
which
would
have
made
his
figure
solitary
in
a
multitude
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
not
far
from
Blackfriars
Bridge
,
when
he
turned
his
head
and
pointed
to
a
solitary
female
figure
flitting
along
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
it
,
readily
,
to
be
the
figure
that
we
sought
.
   
<EOS>
We
crossed
the
road
,
and
were
pressing
on
towards
her
,
when
it
occurred
to
me
that
she
might
be
more
disposed
to
feel
a
woman
's
interest
in
the
lost
girl
,
if
we
spoke
to
her
in
a
quieter
place
,
aloof
from
the
crowd
,
and
where
we
should
be
less
observed
.
 
<EOS>
I
advised
my
companion
,
therefore
,
that
we
should
not
address
her
yet
,
but
follow
her
;
consulting
in
this
,
likewise
,
an
indistinct
desire
I
had
,
to
know
where
she
went
.
   
<EOS>
He
acquiescing
,
we
followed
at
a
distance
:
never
losing
sight
of
her
,
but
never
caring
to
come
very
near
,
as
she
frequently
looked
about
.
 
<EOS>
Once
,
she
stopped
to
listen
to
a
band
of
music
;
and
then
we
stopped
too
.
   
<EOS>
She
went
on
a
long
way
.
 
<EOS>
Still
we
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
evident
,
from
the
manner
in
which
she
held
her
course
,
that
she
was
going
to
some
fixed
destination
;
and
this
,
and
her
keeping
in
the
busy
streets
,
and
I
suppose
the
strange
fascination
in
the
secrecy
and
mystery
of
so
following
anyone
,
made
me
adhere
to
my
first
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
she
turned
into
a
dull
,
dark
street
,
where
the
noise
and
crowd
were
lost
;
and
I
said
,
"
We
may
speak
to
her
now
"
;
<EOS>
and
,
mending
our
pace
,
we
went
after
her
.
      
<EOS>
Chapter
47
.
<EOS>
Martha
 
<EOS>
We
were
now
down
in
Westminster
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
turned
back
to
follow
her
,
having
encountered
her
coming
towards
us
;
and
Westminster
Abbey
was
the
point
at
which
she
passed
from
the
lights
and
noise
of
the
leading
streets
.
 
<EOS>
She
proceeded
so
quickly
,
when
she
got
free
of
the
two
currents
of
passengers
setting
towards
and
from
the
bridge
,
that
,
between
this
and
the
advance
she
had
of
us
when
she
struck
off
,
we
were
in
the
narrow
water
-
side
street
by
Millbank
before
we
came
up
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
At
that
moment
she
crossed
the
road
,
as
if
to
avoid
the
footsteps
that
she
heard
so
close
behind
;
and
,
without
looking
back
,
passed
on
even
more
rapidly
.
   
<EOS>
A
glimpse
of
the
river
through
a
dull
gateway
,
where
some
waggons
were
housed
for
the
night
,
seemed
to
arrest
my
feet
.
 
<EOS>
I
touched
my
companion
without
speaking
,
and
we
both
forbore
to
cross
after
her
,
and
both
followed
on
that
opposite
side
of
the
way
;
keeping
as
quietly
as
we
could
in
the
shadow
of
the
houses
,
but
keeping
very
near
her
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
,
and
is
when
I
write
,
at
the
end
of
that
low
-
lying
street
,
<EOS>
a
dilapidated
little
wooden
building
,
probably
an
obsolete
old
ferry
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
Its
position
is
just
at
that
point
where
the
street
ceases
,
and
the
road
begins
to
lie
between
a
row
of
houses
and
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
came
here
,
and
saw
the
water
,
she
stopped
as
if
she
had
come
to
her
destination
;
and
presently
went
slowly
along
by
the
brink
of
the
river
,
looking
intently
at
it
.
   
<EOS>
All
the
way
here
,
I
had
supposed
that
she
was
going
to
some
house
;
indeed
,
I
had
vaguely
entertained
the
hope
that
the
house
might
be
in
some
way
associated
with
the
lost
girl
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
one
dark
glimpse
of
the
river
,
through
the
gateway
,
had
instinctively
prepared
me
for
her
going
no
farther
.
   
<EOS>
The
neighbourhood
was
a
dreary
one
at
that
time
;
as
oppressive
,
sad
,
and
solitary
by
night
,
as
any
about
London
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
neither
wharves
nor
houses
on
the
melancholy
waste
of
road
near
the
great
blank
Prison
.
 
<EOS>
A
sluggish
ditch
deposited
its
mud
at
the
prison
walls
.
 
<EOS>
Coarse
grass
and
rank
weeds
straggled
over
all
the
marshy
land
in
the
vicinity
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
part
,
carcases
of
houses
,
inauspiciously
begun
and
never
finished
,
rotted
away
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
,
the
ground
was
cumbered
with
rusty
iron
monsters
of
steam
-
boilers
,
wheels
,
cranks
,
pipes
,
furnaces
,
paddles
,
anchors
,
diving
-
bells
,
windmill
-
sails
,
and
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
strange
objects
,
accumulated
by
some
speculator
,
and
grovelling
in
the
dust
,
underneath
which
---
having
sunk
into
the
soil
of
their
own
weight
in
wet
weather
<EOS>
---
they
had
the
appearance
of
vainly
trying
to
hide
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
The
clash
and
glare
of
sundry
fiery
Works
upon
the
river
-
side
,
arose
by
night
to
disturb
everything
except
the
heavy
and
unbroken
smoke
that
poured
out
of
their
chimneys
.
 
<EOS>
Slimy
gaps
and
causeways
,
winding
among
old
wooden
piles
,
with
a
sickly
substance
clinging
to
the
latter
,
like
green
hair
,
and
the
rags
of
last
year
's
handbills
offering
rewards
for
drowned
men
fluttering
above
high
-
water
mark
,
led
down
through
the
ooze
and
slush
to
the
ebb
-
tide
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
story
that
one
of
the
pits
dug
for
the
dead
in
the
time
of
the
Great
Plague
was
hereabout
;
and
a
blighting
influence
seemed
to
have
proceeded
from
it
over
the
whole
place
.
 
<EOS>
Or
else
it
looked
as
if
it
had
gradually
decomposed
into
that
nightmare
condition
,
out
of
the
overflowings
of
the
polluted
stream
.
   
<EOS>
As
if
she
were
a
part
of
the
refuse
it
had
cast
out
,
and
left
to
corruption
and
decay
,
the
girl
we
had
followed
strayed
down
to
the
river
's
brink
,
and
stood
in
the
midst
of
this
night
-
picture
,
lonely
and
still
,
looking
at
the
water
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
some
boats
and
barges
<EOS>
astrand
in
the
mud
,
and
these
enabled
us
to
come
within
a
few
yards
of
her
without
being
seen
.
<EOS>
I
then
signed
to
Mr
Peggotty
to
remain
where
he
was
,
and
emerged
from
their
shade
to
speak
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
approach
her
solitary
figure
without
trembling
;
for
this
gloomy
end
to
her
determined
walk
,
and
the
way
in
which
she
stood
,
almost
within
the
cavernous
shadow
of
the
iron
bridge
,
looking
at
the
lights
crookedly
reflected
in
the
strong
tide
,
inspired
a
dread
within
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
she
was
talking
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
<EOS>
although
absorbed
in
gazing
at
the
water
,
that
her
shawl
was
off
her
shoulders
,
and
that
she
was
muffling
her
hands
in
it
,
in
an
unsettled
and
bewildered
way
,
more
like
the
action
of
a
sleep
-
walker
than
a
waking
person
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
,
and
never
can
forget
,
that
there
was
that
in
her
wild
manner
which
gave
me
no
assurance
but
that
she
would
sink
before
my
eyes
,
until
I
had
her
arm
within
my
grasp
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
I
said
"
Martha
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
uttered
a
terrified
scream
,
and
struggled
with
me
with
such
strength
that
I
doubt
if
I
could
have
held
her
alone
.
 
<EOS>
But
a
stronger
hand
than
mine
was
laid
upon
her
;
and
when
she
raised
her
frightened
eyes
and
saw
whose
it
was
,
she
made
but
one
more
effort
and
dropped
down
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
We
carried
her
away
from
the
water
to
where
there
were
some
dry
stones
,
and
there
laid
her
down
,
crying
and
moaning
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
little
while
she
sat
among
the
stones
,
holding
her
wretched
head
with
both
her
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
the
river
!
<EOS>
"
she
cried
passionately
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
the
river
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
hush
!
"
said
I.
 
"
Calm
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
she
still
repeated
the
same
words
,
continually
exclaiming
,
"
Oh
,
the
river
!
"
<EOS>
over
and
over
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
's
like
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
I
belong
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
it
's
the
natural
company
of
such
as
I
am
!
<EOS>
It
comes
from
country
places
,
where
there
was
once
no
harm
in
it
---
and
it
creeps
through
the
dismal
streets
,
defiled
and
miserable
---
and
it
goes
away
,
like
my
life
,
to
a
great
sea
<EOS>
,
that
is
always
troubled
---
and
I
feel
that
I
must
go
with
it
!
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
known
what
despair
was
,
except
in
the
tone
of
those
words
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
keep
away
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
forget
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
haunts
me
day
and
night
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
the
only
thing
in
all
the
world
that
I
am
fit
for
,
or
that
's
fit
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
dreadful
river
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
thought
passed
through
my
mind
that
in
the
face
of
my
companion
,
as
he
looked
upon
her
without
speech
or
motion
,
I
might
have
read
his
niece
's
history
,
if
I
had
known
nothing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
,
in
any
painting
or
reality
,
horror
and
compassion
so
impressively
blended
.
 
<EOS>
He
shook
as
if
he
would
have
fallen
;
and
his
hand
<EOS>
---
I
touched
it
with
my
own
,
for
his
appearance
<EOS>
alarmed
me
---
was
deadly
cold
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
in
a
state
of
frenzy
,
"
I
whispered
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
will
speak
differently
in
a
little
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
he
would
have
said
in
answer
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
some
motion
with
his
mouth
,
and
seemed
to
think
he
had
spoken
;
but
he
had
only
pointed
to
her
with
his
outstretched
hand
.
   
<EOS>
A
new
burst
of
crying
came
upon
her
now
,
in
which
she
once
more
hid
her
face
among
the
stones
,
and
lay
before
us
,
a
prostrate
image
of
humiliation
and
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
Knowing
that
this
state
must
pass
,
before
we
could
speak
to
her
with
any
hope
,
I
ventured
to
restrain
him
when
he
would
have
raised
her
,
and
we
stood
by
in
silence
until
she
became
more
tranquil
.
   
<EOS>
"
Martha
,
"
said
I
then
,
leaning
down
,
and
helping
her
to
rise
---
she
seemed
to
want
to
rise
as
if
with
the
intention
of
going
away
,
but
she
was
weak
,
and
leaned
against
a
boat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
who
this
is
,
who
is
with
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
said
faintly
,
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
that
we
have
followed
you
a
long
way
tonight
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
neither
at
him
nor
at
me
,
but
stood
in
a
humble
attitude
,
holding
her
bonnet
and
shawl
in
one
hand
,
without
appearing
conscious
of
them
,
and
pressing
the
other
,
clenched
,
against
her
forehead
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
composed
enough
,
"
said
I
,
"
to
speak
on
the
subject
which
so
interested
you
<EOS>
---
I
hope
Heaven
may
remember
it
!
---
that
snowy
night
?
"
   
<EOS>
Her
sobs
broke
out
afresh
,
and
she
murmured
some
inarticulate
thanks
to
me
for
not
having
driven
her
away
from
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
say
nothing
for
myself
,
"
she
said
,
after
a
few
moments
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
bad
,
I
am
lost
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
hope
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
But
tell
him
,
sir
,
"
she
had
shrunk
away
from
him
,
"
if
you
do
n't
feel
too
hard
to
me
to
do
it
,
that
I
never
was
in
any
way
the
cause
of
his
misfortune
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
has
never
been
attributed
to
you
,
"
<EOS>
I
returned
,
earnestly
responding
to
her
earnestness
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
you
,
if
I
do
n't
deceive
myself
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
broken
voice
,
"
that
came
into
the
kitchen
,
the
night
she
took
such
pity
on
me
;
was
so
gentle
to
me
;
did
n't
shrink
away
from
me
like
all
the
rest
,
and
gave
me
such
kind
help
!
<EOS>
Was
it
you
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
been
in
the
river
long
ago
,
"
she
said
,
glancing
at
it
with
a
terrible
expression
,
"
if
any
wrong
to
her
had
been
upon
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
could
have
kept
out
of
it
a
single
winter
's
night
,
if
I
had
not
been
free
of
any
share
in
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
cause
of
her
flight
is
too
well
understood
,
"
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
innocent
of
any
part
in
it
,
we
thoroughly
believe
,
---
we
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
might
have
been
much
the
better
for
her
,
if
I
had
had
a
better
heart
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
girl
,
with
most
forlorn
regret
;
"
for
she
was
always
good
to
me
!
<EOS>
She
never
spoke
a
word
to
me
but
what
was
pleasant
and
right
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
likely
I
would
try
to
make
her
what
I
am
myself
,
knowing
what
I
am
myself
,
so
well
?
 
<EOS>
When
I
lost
everything
that
makes
life
dear
,
the
worst
of
all
my
thoughts
was
that
I
was
parted
for
ever
from
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
,
standing
with
one
hand
on
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
,
and
his
eyes
cast
down
,
put
his
disengaged
hand
before
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
I
heard
what
had
happened
before
that
snowy
night
,
from
some
belonging
to
our
town
,
"
cried
Martha
,
"
the
bitterest
thought
in
all
my
mind
was
,
that
the
people
would
remember
she
once
kept
company
with
me
,
and
would
say
I
had
corrupted
her
!
<EOS>
When
,
Heaven
knows
,
I
would
have
died
to
have
brought
back
her
good
name
!
"
   
<EOS>
Long
unused
to
any
self
-
control
,
the
piercing
agony
of
her
remorse
and
grief
was
terrible
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
have
died
,
would
not
have
been
much
---
what
can
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
---
I
would
have
lived
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
lived
to
be
old
,
in
the
wretched
streets
---
and
to
wander
about
,
avoided
,
in
the
dark
---
and
to
see
the
day
break
on
the
ghastly
line
of
houses
,
and
remember
how
the
same
sun
used
to
shine
into
my
room
,
and
wake
me
once
---
I
would
have
done
even
that
,
to
save
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
Sinking
on
the
stones
,
she
took
some
in
each
hand
,
and
clenched
them
up
,
as
if
she
would
have
ground
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
writhed
into
some
new
posture
constantly
:
stiffening
her
arms
,
twisting
them
before
her
face
,
as
though
to
shut
out
from
her
eyes
the
little
light
there
was
,
and
drooping
her
head
,
as
if
it
were
heavy
with
insupportable
recollections
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
shall
I
ever
do
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
fighting
thus
with
her
despair
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
go
on
as
I
am
,
a
solitary
curse
to
myself
,
a
living
disgrace
to
everyone
I
come
near
!
"
<EOS>
Suddenly
she
turned
to
my
companion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stamp
upon
me
,
kill
me
!
<EOS>
When
she
was
your
pride
,
you
would
have
thought
I
had
done
her
harm
if
I
had
brushed
against
her
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
believe
---
why
should
you
?
 
---
a
syllable
that
comes
out
of
my
lips
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
burning
shame
upon
you
,
even
now
,
if
she
and
I
exchanged
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
complain
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
she
and
<EOS>
I
are
alike
---
<EOS>
I
know
there
is
a
long
,
long
way
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
say
,
with
all
my
guilt
and
wretchedness
upon
my
head
,
that
I
am
grateful
to
her
from
my
soul
,
and
love
her
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
do
n't
think
that
all
the
power
I
had
of
loving
anything
is
quite
worn
out
!
<EOS>
Throw
me
away
,
as
all
the
world
does
.
 
<EOS>
Kill
me
for
being
what
I
am
,
and
having
ever
known
her
;
but
do
n't
think
that
of
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
looked
upon
her
,
while
she
made
this
supplication
,
in
a
wild
distracted
manner
;
and
,
when
she
was
silent
,
gently
raised
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Martha
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
God
forbid
as
I
should
judge
you
.
<EOS>
Forbid
as
I
,
of
all
men
,
should
do
that
,
my
girl
!
<EOS>
You
<EOS>
doen't
know
half
the
change
that
's
come
,
in
course
of
time
,
upon
me
,
when
you
think
it
likely
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
"
<EOS>
he
paused
a
moment
,
then
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
doen't
understand
how
'
tis
that
this
here
gentleman
and
me
has
wished
to
speak
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
<EOS>
doen't
understand
what
'
<EOS>
tis
we
has
afore
us
.
 
<EOS>
Listen
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
influence
upon
her
was
complete
.
 
<EOS>
She
stood
,
shrinkingly
,
before
him
,
as
if
she
were
afraid
to
meet
his
eyes
;
but
her
passionate
sorrow
was
quite
hushed
and
mute
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
heerd
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
owt
of
what
passed
between
Mas'r
Davy
and
me
,
th
'
night
when
it
snew
so
hard
,
you
know
as
I
have
been
---
wheer
not
---
fur
to
seek
my
dear
niece
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
niece
,
"
he
repeated
steadily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fur
she
's
more
dear
to
me
now
,
Martha
,
than
she
was
dear
afore
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
put
her
hands
before
her
face
;
but
otherwise
remained
quiet
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
heerd
her
tell
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
as
you
was
early
left
fatherless
and
motherless
,
with
no
friend
fur
to
take
,
in
a
rough
seafaring
-
way
,
their
place
.
 
<EOS>
Maybe
you
can
guess
that
if
you
'd
had
such
a
friend
,
you
'd
have
got
into
a
way
of
being
fond
of
him
in
course
of
time
,
and
that
my
niece
was
kiender
daughter
<EOS>
-
like
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
she
was
silently
trembling
,
he
put
her
shawl
carefully
about
her
,
taking
it
up
from
the
ground
for
that
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whereby
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
know
,
both
as
she
would
go
to
the
wureld
's
furdest
end
with
me
,
if
she
could
once
see
me
again
;
and
that
she
would
fly
to
the
wureld
's
furdest
end
to
keep
off
seeing
me
.
 
<EOS>
For
though
she
ai
n't
no
call
to
doubt
my
love
,
and
doen't
---
and
doen't
,
"
he
repeated
,
with
a
quiet
assurance
of
the
truth
of
what
he
said
,
"
there
's
shame
steps
in
,
and
keeps
betwixt
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
read
,
in
every
word
of
his
plain
impressive
way
of
delivering
himself
,
new
evidence
of
his
having
thought
of
this
one
topic
,
in
every
feature
it
presented
.
   
<EOS>
"
According
to
our
reckoning
,
"
he
proceeded
,
"
Mas'r
Davy
's
here
,
and
mine
,
she
is
like
,
one
day
,
to
make
her
own
poor
solitary
course
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
We
believe
---
<EOS>
Mas'r
Davy
,
me
,
and
all
of
us
---
that
you
are
as
innocent
of
everything
that
has
befell
her
,
as
the
unborn
child
.
<EOS>
You
've
spoke
of
her
being
pleasant
,
kind
,
and
gentle
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
her
,
I
knew
she
was
!
<EOS>
I
knew
she
always
was
,
to
all
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
thankful
to
her
,
and
you
love
her
.
 
<EOS>
Help
us
all
you
can
to
find
her
,
and
may
Heaven
reward
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
hastily
,
and
for
the
first
time
,
as
if
she
were
doubtful
of
what
he
had
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
trust
me
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
in
a
low
voice
of
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Full
and
free
!
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
speak
to
her
,
if
I
should
ever
find
her
;
shelter
her
,
if
I
have
any
shelter
to
divide
with
her
;
and
then
,
without
her
knowledge
,
come
to
you
,
and
bring
you
to
her
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
hurriedly
.
   
<EOS>
We
both
replied
together
,
"
Yes
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
lifted
up
her
eyes
,
and
solemnly
declared
that
she
would
devote
herself
to
this
task
,
fervently
and
faithfully
.
 
<EOS>
That
she
would
never
waver
in
it
,
never
be
diverted
from
it
,
never
relinquish
it
,
while
there
was
any
chance
of
hope
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
were
not
true
to
it
,
might
the
object
she
now
had
in
life
,
which
bound
her
to
something
devoid
of
evil
,
in
its
passing
away
from
her
,
leave
her
more
forlorn
and
more
despairing
,
if
that
were
possible
,
than
she
had
been
upon
the
river
's
brink
that
night
;
and
then
might
all
help
,
human
and
Divine
,
renounce
her
evermore
!
   
<EOS>
She
did
not
raise
her
voice
above
her
breath
,
or
address
us
,
but
said
this
to
the
night
sky
;
then
stood
profoundly
quiet
,
looking
at
the
gloomy
water
.
   
<EOS>
We
judged
it
expedient
,
now
,
to
tell
her
all
we
knew
;
which
I
recounted
at
length
.
 
<EOS>
She
listened
with
great
attention
,
and
with
a
face
that
often
changed
,
but
had
the
same
purpose
in
all
its
varying
expressions
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eyes
occasionally
filled
with
tears
,
but
those
she
repressed
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
her
spirit
were
quite
altered
,
and
she
could
not
be
too
quiet
.
   
<EOS>
She
asked
,
when
all
was
told
,
where
we
were
to
be
communicated
with
,
if
occasion
should
arise
.
 
<EOS>
Under
a
dull
lamp
in
the
road
,
I
wrote
our
two
addresses
on
a
leaf
of
my
pocket
-
book
,
which
I
tore
out
and
gave
to
her
,
and
which
she
put
in
her
poor
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
her
where
she
lived
herself
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
after
a
pause
,
in
no
place
long
.
 
<EOS>
It
were
better
not
to
know
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
suggesting
to
me
,
in
a
whisper
<EOS>
,
what
had
already
occurred
to
myself
,
I
took
out
my
purse
;
but
I
could
not
prevail
upon
her
to
accept
any
money
,
nor
could
I
exact
any
promise
from
her
that
she
would
do
so
at
another
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
represented
to
her
that
Mr
Peggotty
could
not
be
called
,
for
one
in
his
condition
,
poor
;
and
that
the
idea
of
her
engaging
in
this
search
,
while
depending
on
her
own
resources
,
shocked
us
both
.
 
<EOS>
She
continued
steadfast
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
particular
,
his
influence
upon
her
was
equally
powerless
with
mine
.
 
<EOS>
She
gratefully
thanked
him
but
remained
inexorable
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
may
be
work
to
be
got
,
"
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
try
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
least
take
some
assistance
,
"
I
returned
,
"
until
you
have
tried
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
do
what
I
have
promised
,
for
money
,
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
take
it
,
if
I
was
starving
.
 
<EOS>
To
give
me
money
would
be
to
take
away
your
trust
,
to
take
away
the
object
that
you
have
given
me
,
to
take
away
the
only
certain
thing
that
saves
me
from
the
river
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
name
of
the
great
judge
,
"
said
I
,
"
before
whom
you
and
all
of
us
must
stand
at
His
dread
time
,
dismiss
that
terrible
idea
!
<EOS>
We
can
all
do
some
good
,
if
we
will
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
trembled
,
and
her
lip
shook
,
and
her
face
was
paler
,
as
she
answered
:
   
"
It
has
been
put
into
your
hearts
,
perhaps
,
to
save
a
wretched
creature
for
repentance
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
to
think
so
;
it
seems
too
bold
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
good
should
come
of
me
,
I
might
begin
to
hope
;
for
nothing
but
harm
has
ever
come
of
my
deeds
yet
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
to
be
trusted
,
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
while
,
with
my
miserable
life
,
on
account
of
what
you
have
given
me
to
try
for
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
no
more
,
and
I
can
say
no
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
Again
she
repressed
the
tears
that
had
begun
to
flow
;
and
,
putting
out
her
trembling
hand
,
and
touching
Mr
Peggotty
,
as
if
there
was
some
healing
virtue
in
him
,
went
away
along
the
desolate
road
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
ill
,
probably
for
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
observed
,
upon
that
closer
opportunity
of
observation
,
that
she
was
worn
and
haggard
,
and
that
her
sunken
eyes
expressed
privation
and
endurance
.
   
<EOS>
We
followed
her
at
a
short
distance
,
our
way
lying
in
the
same
direction
,
until
we
came
back
into
the
lighted
and
populous
streets
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
such
implicit
confidence
in
her
declaration
,
that
I
then
put
it
to
Mr
Peggotty
,
whether
it
would
not
seem
,
in
the
onset
,
like
distrusting
her
,
to
follow
her
any
farther
.
 
<EOS>
He
being
of
the
same
mind
,
and
equally
reliant
on
her
,
we
suffered
her
to
take
her
own
road
,
and
took
ours
,
which
was
towards
Highgate
.
 
<EOS>
He
accompanied
me
a
good
part
of
the
way
;
and
when
we
parted
,
with
a
prayer
for
the
success
of
this
fresh
effort
,
there
was
a
new
and
thoughtful
compassion
in
him
that
I
was
at
no
loss
to
interpret
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
midnight
when
I
arrived
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
reached
my
own
gate
,
and
was
standing
listening
for
the
deep
bell
of
St
Paul
's
,
the
sound
of
which
I
thought
had
been
borne
towards
me
among
the
multitude
of
striking
clocks
,
when
I
was
rather
surprised
to
see
that
the
door
of
my
aunt
's
cottage
was
open
,
and
that
a
faint
light
in
the
entry
was
shining
out
across
the
road
.
   
<EOS>
Thinking
that
my
aunt
might
have
relapsed
into
one
of
her
old
alarms
,
and
might
be
watching
the
progress
of
some
imaginary
conflagration
in
the
distance
,
I
went
to
speak
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
with
very
great
surprise
that
I
saw
a
man
standing
in
her
little
garden
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
a
glass
and
bottle
in
his
hand
,
and
was
in
the
act
of
drinking
.
 
<EOS>
I
stopped
short
,
among
the
thick
foliage
outside
,
for
the
moon
<EOS>
was
up
now
,
though
obscured
;
and
I
recognized
the
man
whom
I
had
once
supposed
to
be
a
delusion
of
Mr
Dick
's
,
and
had
once
encountered
with
my
aunt
in
the
streets
of
the
city
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
eating
as
well
as
drinking
,
and
seemed
to
eat
with
a
hungry
appetite
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
curious
regarding
the
cottage
,
too
,
as
if
it
were
the
first
time
he
had
seen
it
.
 
<EOS>
After
stooping
to
put
the
bottle
on
the
ground
,
he
looked
up
at
the
windows
,
and
looked
about
;
though
with
a
covert
and
impatient
air
,
as
if
he
was
anxious
to
be
gone
.
   
<EOS>
The
light
in
the
passage
was
obscured
for
a
moment
,
and
my
aunt
came
out
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
agitated
,
and
told
some
money
into
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
it
chink
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
use
of
this
?
"
he
demanded
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
spare
no
more
,
"
returned
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
ca
n't
go
,
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
!
<EOS>
You
may
take
it
back
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
bad
man
,
"
returned
my
aunt
,
with
great
emotion
;
"
how
can
you
use
me
so
?
 
<EOS>
But
why
do
I
ask
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
because
you
know
how
weak
I
am
!
<EOS>
What
have
I
to
do
,
to
free
myself
for
ever
of
your
visits
,
but
to
abandon
you
to
your
deserts
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
why
do
n't
you
abandon
me
to
my
deserts
?
"
said
he
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
ask
me
why
!
"
returned
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
heart
you
must
have
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
stood
moodily
rattling
the
money
,
and
shaking
his
head
,
until
at
length
he
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Is
this
all
you
mean
to
give
me
,
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
I
CAN
give
you
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
have
had
losses
,
and
am
poorer
than
I
used
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
so
.
<EOS>
Having
got
it
,
why
do
you
give
me
the
pain
of
looking
at
you
for
another
moment
,
and
seeing
what
you
have
become
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
become
shabby
enough
,
if
you
mean
that
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
lead
the
life
of
an
owl
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
stripped
me
of
the
greater
part
of
all
I
ever
had
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
closed
my
heart
against
the
whole
world
,
years
and
years
.
 
<EOS>
You
treated
me
falsely
,
ungratefully
,
and
cruelly
.
 
<EOS>
Go
,
and
repent
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
add
new
injuries
to
the
long
,
long
list
of
injuries
you
have
done
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
<EOS>
"
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
very
fine
---
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
must
do
the
best
I
can
,
for
the
present
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
In
spite
of
himself
,
he
appeared
abashed
by
my
aunt
's
indignant
tears
,
and
came
slouching
out
of
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
Taking
two
or
three
quick
steps
,
as
if
I
had
just
come
up
,
I
met
him
at
the
gate
,
and
went
in
as
he
came
out
.
 
<EOS>
We
eyed
one
another
narrowly
in
passing
,
and
with
no
favour
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aunt
,
"
said
I
,
hurriedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
man
alarming
you
again
!
<EOS>
Let
me
speak
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Who
is
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Child
,
"
returned
my
aunt
,
taking
my
arm
,
"
come
in
,
and
do
n't
speak
to
me
for
ten
minutes
.
"
   
<EOS>
We
sat
down
in
her
little
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
retired
behind
the
round
green
fan
of
former
days
,
which
was
screwed
on
the
back
of
a
chair
,
and
occasionally
wiped
her
eyes
,
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
came
out
,
and
took
a
seat
beside
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trot
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
calmly
,
"
it
's
my
husband
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
husband
,
aunt
?
 
<EOS>
I
thought
he
had
been
dead
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dead
to
me
,
"
returned
my
aunt
,
"
but
living
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
sat
in
silent
amazement
.
   
<EOS>
"
Betsey
Trotwood
do
n't
look
a
likely
subject
for
the
tender
passion
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
composedly
,
"
but
the
time
was
,
Trot
,
when
she
believed
in
that
man
most
entirely
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
loved
him
,
Trot
,
right
well
.
 
<EOS>
When
there
was
no
proof
of
attachment
and
affection
that
she
would
not
have
given
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
repaid
her
by
breaking
her
fortune
,
and
nearly
breaking
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
put
all
that
sort
of
sentiment
,
once
and
for
ever
,
in
a
grave
,
and
filled
it
up
,
and
flattened
it
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
good
aunt
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
left
him
,
"
my
aunt
proceeded
,
laying
her
hand
as
usual
on
the
back
of
mine
,
"
generously
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
say
at
this
distance
of
time
,
Trot
,
that
I
left
him
generously
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
so
cruel
to
me
,
that
I
might
have
effected
a
separation
on
easy
terms
for
myself
;
but
I
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
made
ducks
and
drakes
of
what
I
gave
him
,
sank
lower
and
lower
,
married
another
woman
,
I
believe
,
became
an
adventurer
,
a
gambler
,
and
a
cheat
.
 
<EOS>
What
he
is
now
,
you
see
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
a
fine
-
looking
man
when
I
married
him
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
with
an
echo
of
her
old
pride
and
admiration
in
her
tone
;
"
and
I
believed
him
---
I
was
a
fool
!
---
to
be
the
soul
of
honour
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
gave
my
hand
a
squeeze
,
and
shook
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
nothing
to
me
now
,
Trot
,
less
than
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
sooner
than
have
him
punished
for
his
offences
(
as
he
would
be
if
he
prowled
about
in
this
country
)
,
I
give
him
more
money
than
I
can
afford
,
at
intervals
when
he
reappears
,
to
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
a
fool
when
I
married
him
;
and
I
am
so
far
an
incurable
fool
on
that
subject
,
that
,
for
the
sake
of
what
I
once
believed
him
to
be
,
I
would
n't
have
even
this
shadow
of
my
idle
fancy
hardly
dealt
with
.
<EOS>
For
I
was
in
earnest
,
Trot
,
if
ever
a
woman
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
MY
aunt
dismissed
the
matter
with
a
heavy
sigh
,
and
smoothed
her
dress
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
you
know
the
beginning
,
middle
,
and
end
,
and
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
wo
n't
mention
the
subject
to
one
another
any
more
;
neither
,
of
course
,
will
you
mention
it
to
anybody
else
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
my
grumpy
,
frumpy
story
,
and
we
'll
keep
it
to
ourselves
,
Trot

Chapter
48
.
<EOS>
Domestic
 
<EOS>
I
laboured
hard
at
my
book
,
without
allowing
it
to
interfere
with
the
punctual
discharge
of
my
newspaper
duties
;
and
it
came
out
and
was
very
successful
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
stunned
by
the
praise
which
sounded
in
my
ears
,
notwithstanding
that
I
was
keenly
alive
to
it
,
and
thought
better
of
my
own
performance
,
I
have
little
doubt
,
than
anybody
else
did
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
always
been
in
my
observation
of
human
nature
,
that
a
man
who
has
any
good
reason
to
believe
in
himself
never
flourishes
himself
before
the
faces
of
other
people
in
order
that
they
may
believe
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
reason
,
I
retained
my
modesty
in
very
self
-
respect
;
and
the
more
praise
I
got
,
the
more
I
tried
to
deserve
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
not
my
purpose
,
in
this
record
,
though
in
all
other
essentials
it
is
my
written
memory
,
to
pursue
the
history
of
my
own
fictions
.
 
<EOS>
They
express
themselves
,
and
I
leave
them
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
When
I
refer
to
them
,
incidentally
,
it
is
only
as
a
part
of
my
progress
.
   
<EOS>
Having
some
foundation
for
believing
,
by
this
time
,
that
nature
and
accident
had
made
me
an
author
,
I
pursued
my
vocation
with
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
Without
such
assurance
I
should
certainly
have
left
it
alone
,
and
bestowed
my
energy
on
some
other
endeavour
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
tried
to
find
out
what
nature
and
accident
really
had
made
me
,
and
to
be
that
,
and
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
writing
,
in
the
newspaper
and
elsewhere
,
so
prosperously
,
that
when
my
new
success
was
achieved
,
I
considered
myself
reasonably
entitled
to
escape
from
the
dreary
debates
.
 
<EOS>
One
joyful
night
,
therefore
,
I
noted
down
the
music
of
the
parliamentary
bagpipes
for
the
last
time
,
and
I
have
never
heard
it
since
;
though
I
still
recognize
the
old
drone
in
the
newspapers
,
without
any
substantial
variation
(
except
,
perhaps
,
that
there
is
more
of
it
)
,
all
the
livelong
session
.
   
<EOS>
I
now
write
of
the
time
when
I
had
been
married
,
I
suppose
,
about
a
year
and
a
half
.
 
<EOS>
After
several
varieties
of
experiment
,
we
had
given
up
the
housekeeping
as
a
bad
job
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
kept
itself
,
and
we
kept
a
page
.
 
<EOS>
The
principal
function
of
this
retainer
was
to
quarrel
with
the
cook
;
in
which
respect
he
was
a
perfect
Whittington
,
without
his
cat
,
or
the
remotest
chance
of
being
made
Lord
Mayor
.
   
<EOS>
He
appears
to
me
to
have
lived
in
a
hail
of
saucepan
-
lids
.
 
<EOS>
His
whole
existence
was
a
scuffle
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
shriek
for
help
on
the
most
improper
occasions
,
---
as
when
we
had
a
little
dinner
-
party
,
or
a
few
friends
in
the
evening
,
---
and
would
come
tumbling
out
of
the
kitchen
,
with
iron
missiles
flying
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
wanted
to
get
rid
of
him
,
but
he
was
very
much
attached
to
us
,
and
would
n't
go
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
tearful
boy
,
and
broke
into
such
deplorable
lamentations
,
when
a
cessation
of
our
connexion
was
hinted
at
,
that
we
were
obliged
to
keep
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
mother
---
no
anything
in
the
way
of
a
relative
,
that
I
could
discover
,
except
a
sister
,
who
fled
to
America
the
moment
we
had
taken
him
off
her
hands
;
and
he
became
quartered
on
us
like
a
horrible
young
changeling
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
lively
perception
of
his
own
unfortunate
state
,
and
was
always
rubbing
his
eyes
with
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket
,
or
stooping
to
blow
his
nose
on
the
extreme
corner
of
a
little
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
which
he
never
would
take
completely
out
of
his
pocket
,
but
always
economized
and
secreted
.
   
<EOS>
This
unlucky
page
,
engaged
in
an
evil
hour
at
six
pounds
ten
per
annum
,
was
a
source
of
continual
trouble
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
watched
him
as
he
grew
---
and
he
grew
like
scarlet
beans
---
with
painful
apprehensions
of
the
time
when
he
would
begin
to
shave
;
even
of
the
days
when
he
would
be
bald
or
grey
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
no
prospect
of
ever
getting
rid
of
him
;
and
,
projecting
myself
into
the
future
,
used
to
think
what
an
inconvenience
he
would
be
when
he
was
an
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
I
never
expected
anything
less
,
than
this
unfortunate
's
manner
of
getting
me
out
of
my
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
He
stole
Dora
's
watch
,
which
,
like
everything
else
belonging
to
us
,
had
no
particular
place
of
its
own
;
and
,
converting
it
into
money
,
spent
the
produce
<EOS>
(
he
was
always
a
weak
-
minded
boy
)
in
incessantly
riding
up
and
down
between
London
and
Uxbridge
outside
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
taken
to
Bow
Street
,
as
well
as
I
remember
,
on
the
completion
of
his
fifteenth
journey
;
when
four
-
and
-
sixpence
,
and
a
second
-
hand
fife
which
he
could
n't
play
,
were
found
upon
his
person
.
   
<EOS>
The
surprise
and
its
consequences
would
have
been
much
less
disagreeable
to
me
if
he
had
not
been
penitent
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
very
penitent
indeed
,
and
in
a
peculiar
way
---
not
in
the
lump
,
but
by
instalments
.
 
<EOS>
For
example
:
the
day
after
that
on
which
I
was
obliged
to
appear
against
him
,
he
made
certain
revelations
touching
a
hamper
in
the
cellar
,
which
we
believed
to
be
full
of
wine
,
but
which
had
nothing
in
it
except
bottles
and
corks
.
 
<EOS>
We
supposed
he
had
now
eased
his
mind
,
and
told
the
worst
he
knew
of
the
cook
;
but
,
a
day
or
two
afterwards
,
his
conscience
sustained
a
new
twinge
,
and
he
disclosed
how
she
had
a
little
girl
,
who
,
early
every
morning
,
took
away
our
bread
;
and
also
how
he
himself
had
been
suborned
to
maintain
the
milkman
in
coals
.
 
<EOS>
In
two
or
three
days
more
,
I
was
informed
by
the
authorities
of
his
having
led
to
the
discovery
of
sirloins
of
beef
among
the
kitchen
-
stuff
,
and
sheets
in
the
rag
-
bag
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
while
afterwards
,
he
broke
out
in
an
entirely
new
direction
,
and
confessed
to
a
knowledge
of
burglarious
intentions
as
to
our
premises
,
on
the
part
of
the
pot
-
boy
,
who
was
immediately
taken
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
to
be
so
ashamed
of
being
such
a
victim
<EOS>
,
that
I
would
have
given
him
any
money
to
hold
his
tongue
,
or
would
have
offered
a
round
bribe
for
his
being
permitted
to
run
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
aggravating
circumstance
in
the
case
that
he
had
no
idea
of
this
,
but
conceived
that
he
was
making
me
amends
in
every
new
discovery
:
not
to
say
,
heaping
obligations
on
my
head
.
   
<EOS>
At
last
I
ran
away
myself
,
whenever
I
saw
an
emissary
of
the
police
approaching
with
some
new
intelligence
;
and
lived
a
stealthy
life
until
he
was
tried
and
ordered
to
be
transported
.
 
<EOS>
Even
then
he
could
n't
be
quiet
,
but
was
always
writing
us
letters
;
and
wanted
so
much
to
see
Dora
before
he
went
away
,
that
Dora
went
to
visit
him
,
and
fainted
when
she
found
herself
inside
the
iron
bars
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
had
no
peace
of
my
life
until
he
was
expatriated
,
and
made
(
as
I
afterwards
heard
)
a
shepherd
of
,
"
up
the
country
"
somewhere
;
I
have
no
geographical
idea
<EOS>
where
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
led
me
into
some
serious
reflections
,
and
presented
our
mistakes
in
a
new
aspect
;
as
I
could
not
help
communicating
to
Dora
one
evening
,
in
spite
of
my
tenderness
for
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
love
,
"
said
I
,
"
it
is
very
painful
to
me
to
think
that
our
want
of
system
and
management
,
involves
not
only
ourselves
(
which
we
have
got
used
to
)
,
but
other
people
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
silent
for
a
long
time
,
and
now
you
are
going
to
be
cross
!
"
said
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
my
dear
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Let
me
explain
to
you
what
I
mean
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
do
n't
want
to
know
,
"
said
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
want
you
to
know
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
Put
Jip
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
Dora
put
his
nose
to
mine
,
and
said
"
Boh
!
"
to
drive
my
seriousness
away
;
but
,
not
succeeding
,
ordered
him
into
his
Pagoda
,
and
sat
looking
at
me
,
with
her
hands
folded
,
and
a
most
resigned
little
expression
of
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
my
dear
,
"
I
began
,
"
there
is
contagion
in
us
.
 
<EOS>
We
infect
everyone
about
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
might
have
gone
on
in
this
figurative
manner
,
if
Dora
's
face
had
not
admonished
me
that
she
was
wondering
with
all
her
might
whether
I
was
going
to
propose
any
new
kind
of
vaccination
,
or
other
medical
remedy
,
for
this
unwholesome
state
of
ours
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
checked
myself
,
and
made
my
meaning
plainer
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
merely
,
my
pet
,
"
said
I
,
"
that
we
lose
money
and
comfort
,
and
even
temper
sometimes
,
by
not
learning
to
be
more
careful
;
but
that
we
incur
the
serious
responsibility
of
spoiling
everyone
who
comes
into
our
service
,
or
has
any
dealings
with
us
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
be
afraid
that
the
fault
is
not
entirely
on
one
side
,
but
that
these
people
all
turn
out
ill
because
we
do
n't
turn
out
very
well
ourselves
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
an
accusation
,
"
exclaimed
Dora
,
opening
her
eyes
wide
;
"
to
say
that
you
ever
saw
me
take
gold
watches
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
<EOS>
,
"
I
remonstrated
,
"
do
n't
talk
preposterous
nonsense
!
<EOS>
Who
has
made
the
least
allusion
to
gold
watches
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
did
,
"
returned
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
you
did
.
 
<EOS>
You
said
I
had
n't
turned
out
well
,
and
compared
me
to
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
whom
?
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
the
page
,
"
sobbed
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
cruel
fellow
,
to
compare
your
affectionate
wife
to
a
transported
page
!
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
you
tell
me
your
opinion
of
me
before
we
were
married
?
 
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
you
say
,
you
hard
-
hearted
thing
,
that
you
were
convinced
I
was
worse
than
a
transported
page
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
a
dreadful
opinion
to
have
of
me
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
goodness
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Dora
,
my
love
,
"
I
returned
,
gently
trying
to
remove
the
handkerchief
she
pressed
to
her
eyes
,
"
this
is
not
only
very
ridiculous
of
you
,
but
very
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
it
's
not
true
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
always
said
he
was
a
story
-
teller
,
"
sobbed
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
you
say
the
same
of
me
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
shall
I
do
!
<EOS>
What
shall
I
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
darling
girl
,
"
I
retorted
,
"
I
really
must
entreat
you
to
be
reasonable
,
and
listen
to
what
I
did
say
,
and
do
say
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Dora
,
unless
we
learn
to
do
our
duty
to
those
whom
we
employ
,
they
will
never
learn
to
do
their
duty
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
we
present
opportunities
to
people
to
do
wrong
<EOS>
,
that
never
ought
to
be
presented
.
 
<EOS>
Even
if
we
were
as
lax
as
we
are
,
in
all
our
arrangements
,
by
choice
---
which
we
are
not
---
even
if
we
liked
it
,
and
found
it
agreeable
to
be
so
---
<EOS>
which
we
do
n't
<EOS>
---
I
am
persuaded
we
should
have
no
right
to
go
on
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
positively
corrupting
people
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
bound
to
think
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
thinking
of
it
,
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
reflection
I
am
unable
to
dismiss
,
and
it
sometimes
makes
me
very
uneasy
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
dear
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
Come
now
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
foolish
!
"
   
<EOS>
Dora
would
not
allow
me
,
for
a
long
time
,
to
remove
the
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
sobbing
and
murmuring
behind
it
,
that
,
if
I
was
uneasy
,
why
had
I
ever
been
married
?
 
<EOS>
Why
had
n't
I
said
,
even
the
day
before
we
went
to
church
,
that
I
knew
I
should
be
uneasy
,
and
I
would
rather
not
?
 
<EOS>
If
I
could
n't
bear
her
,
why
did
n't
I
send
her
away
to
her
aunts
at
Putney
,
or
to
Julia
Mills
in
India
?
 
<EOS>
Julia
would
be
glad
to
see
her
,
and
would
not
call
her
a
transported
page
;
Julia
never
had
called
her
anything
of
the
sort
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
Dora
was
so
afflicted
,
and
so
afflicted
me
by
being
in
that
condition
,
that
I
felt
it
was
of
no
use
repeating
this
kind
of
effort
,
though
never
so
mildly
,
and
I
must
take
some
other
course
.
   
<EOS>
What
other
course
was
left
to
take
?
 
<EOS>
To
"
form
her
mind
"
?
 
<EOS>
This
was
a
common
phrase
of
words
which
had
a
fair
and
promising
sound
,
and
I
resolved
to
form
Dora
's
mind
.
   
<EOS>
I
began
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
When
Dora
was
very
childish
,
and
I
would
have
infinitely
preferred
to
humour
her
,
I
tried
to
be
grave
---
and
disconcerted
her
,
and
myself
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
talked
to
her
on
the
subjects
which
occupied
my
thoughts
;
and
I
read
Shakespeare
to
her
---
and
fatigued
her
to
the
last
degree
.
 
<EOS>
I
accustomed
myself
to
giving
her
,
as
it
were
quite
casually
,
little
scraps
of
useful
information
,
or
sound
opinion
---
and
she
started
from
them
when
I
let
them
off
,
as
if
they
had
been
crackers
.
 
<EOS>
No
matter
how
incidentally
or
naturally
I
endeavoured
to
form
my
little
wife
's
mind
,
I
could
not
help
seeing
that
she
always
had
an
instinctive
perception
of
what
I
was
about
,
and
became
a
prey
to
the
keenest
apprehensions
.
 
<EOS>
In
particular
,
it
was
clear
to
me
,
that
she
thought
Shakespeare
a
terrible
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
The
formation
went
on
very
slowly
.
   
<EOS>
I
pressed
Traddles
into
the
service
without
his
knowledge
;
and
whenever
he
came
to
see
us
,
exploded
my
mines
upon
him
for
the
edification
of
Dora
at
second
hand
.
 
<EOS>
The
amount
of
practical
wisdom
I
bestowed
upon
Traddles
in
this
manner
was
immense
,
and
of
the
best
quality
;
but
it
had
no
other
effect
upon
Dora
than
to
depress
her
spirits
,
and
make
her
always
nervous
with
the
dread
that
it
would
be
her
turn
next
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
myself
in
the
condition
of
a
schoolmaster
,
a
trap
,
a
pitfall
;
of
always
playing
spider
to
Dora
's
fly
,
and
always
pouncing
out
of
my
hole
to
her
infinite
disturbance
.
   
<EOS>
Still
,
looking
forward
through
this
intermediate
stage
,
to
the
time
when
there
should
be
a
perfect
sympathy
between
Dora
and
me
,
and
when
I
should
have
"
formed
her
mind
"
to
my
entire
satisfaction
,
I
persevered
,
even
for
months
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
at
last
,
however
,
that
,
although
I
had
been
all
this
time
a
very
porcupine
or
hedgehog
,
bristling
all
over
with
determination
,
I
had
effected
nothing
,
it
began
to
occur
to
me
that
perhaps
Dora
's
mind
was
already
formed
.
   
<EOS>
On
further
consideration
this
appeared
so
likely
,
that
I
abandoned
my
scheme
,
which
had
had
a
more
promising
appearance
in
words
than
in
action
;
resolving
henceforth
to
be
satisfied
with
my
child
-
wife
,
and
to
try
to
change
her
into
nothing
else
by
any
process
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
heartily
tired
of
being
sagacious
and
prudent
by
myself
,
and
of
seeing
my
darling
under
restraint
;
so
I
bought
a
pretty
pair
of
ear
-
rings
for
her
,
and
a
collar
for
Jip
,
and
went
home
one
day
to
make
myself
agreeable
.
   
<EOS>
Dora
was
delighted
with
the
little
presents
,
and
kissed
me
joyfully
;
but
there
was
a
shadow
between
us
,
however
slight
,
and
I
had
made
up
my
mind
that
it
should
not
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
must
be
such
a
shadow
anywhere
,
I
would
keep
it
for
the
future
in
my
own
breast
.
   
<EOS>
I
sat
down
by
my
wife
on
the
sofa
,
and
put
the
ear
-
rings
in
her
ears
;
and
then
I
told
her
that
I
feared
we
had
not
been
quite
as
good
company
lately
,
as
we
used
to
be
,
and
that
the
fault
was
mine
.
<EOS>
Which
I
sincerely
felt
,
and
which
indeed
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
Dora
,
my
life
,
"
I
said
;
"
I
have
been
trying
to
be
wise
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
And
to
make
me
wise
too
,
"
said
Dora
,
timidly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
n't
you
,
Doady
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
nodded
assent
to
the
pretty
inquiry
of
the
raised
eyebrows
,
and
kissed
the
parted
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
of
not
a
bit
of
use
,
"
said
Dora
,
shaking
her
head
,
until
the
ear
-
rings
rang
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
a
little
thing
I
am
,
and
what
I
wanted
you
to
call
me
from
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
ca
n't
do
so
,
I
am
afraid
you
'll
never
like
me
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
you
do
n't
think
,
sometimes
,
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
Done
what
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
For
she
made
no
effort
to
proceed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
!
"
said
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
.
   
<EOS>
She
put
her
arms
<EOS>
round
my
neck
,
and
laughed
,
and
called
herself
by
her
favourite
name
of
a
goose
,
and
hid
her
face
on
my
shoulder
in
such
a
profusion
of
curls
that
it
was
quite
a
task
to
clear
them
away
and
see
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
I
think
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
done
nothing
,
than
to
have
tried
to
form
my
little
wife
's
mind
?
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
laughing
at
myself
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
that
the
question
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
that
what
you
have
been
trying
?
"
cried
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
what
a
shocking
boy
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
never
try
any
more
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
For
I
love
her
dearly
as
she
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Without
a
story
---
really
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Dora
,
creeping
closer
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
seek
to
change
,
"
said
I
,
"
what
has
been
so
precious
to
me
for
so
long
!
<EOS>
You
never
can
show
better
than
as
your
own
natural
self
,
my
sweet
Dora
;
and
we
'll
try
no
conceited
experiments
,
but
go
back
to
our
old
way
,
and
be
happy
.
"
   
"
And
be
happy
!
"
returned
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
All
day
!
<EOS>
And
you
wo
n't
mind
things
going
a
tiny
morsel
wrong
,
sometimes
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
do
the
best
we
can
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
you
wo
n't
tell
me
,
any
more
,
that
we
make
other
people
bad
,
"
coaxed
Dora
;
"
will
you
?
 
<EOS>
Because
you
know
it
's
so
dreadfully
cross
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
it
's
better
for
me
to
be
stupid
than
uncomfortable
,
is
n't
it
?
"
said
Dora
.
   
<EOS>
"
Better
to
be
naturally
Dora
than
anything
else
in
the
world
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
the
world
!
<EOS>
Ah
,
Doady
,
it
's
a
large
place
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
,
turned
her
delighted
bright
eyes
up
to
mine
,
kissed
me
,
broke
into
a
merry
laugh
,
and
sprang
away
to
put
on
Jip
's
new
collar
.
   
<EOS>
So
ended
my
last
attempt
to
make
any
change
in
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
been
unhappy
in
trying
it
;
I
could
not
endure
my
own
solitary
wisdom
;
I
could
not
reconcile
it
with
her
former
appeal
to
me
as
my
child
-
wife
.
 
<EOS>
I
resolved
to
do
what
I
could
,
in
a
quiet
way
,
to
improve
our
proceedings
myself
,
but
I
foresaw
that
my
utmost
would
be
very
little
,
or
I
must
degenerate
into
the
spider
again
,
and
be
for
ever
lying
in
wait
.
   
<EOS>
And
the
shadow
I
have
mentioned
,
that
was
not
to
be
between
us
any
more
,
but
was
to
rest
wholly
on
my
own
heart
?
 
<EOS>
How
did
that
fall
?
   
<EOS>
The
old
unhappy
feeling
pervaded
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
deepened
,
if
it
were
changed
at
all
;
but
it
was
as
undefined
as
ever
,
and
addressed
me
like
a
strain
of
sorrowful
music
faintly
heard
in
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
loved
my
wife
dearly
,
and
I
was
happy
;
but
<EOS>
the
happiness
I
had
vaguely
anticipated
,
once
,
was
not
the
happiness
I
enjoyed
,
and
there
was
always
something
wanting
.
   
<EOS>
In
fulfilment
of
the
compact
I
have
made
with
myself
,
to
reflect
my
mind
on
this
paper
,
I
again
examine
it
,
closely
,
and
bring
its
secrets
to
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
missed
,
I
still
regarded
<EOS>
---
I
always
regarded
---
as
something
that
had
been
a
dream
of
my
youthful
fancy
;
that
was
incapable
of
realization
;
that
I
was
now
discovering
to
be
so
,
with
some
natural
pain
,
as
all
men
did
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
if
my
wife
could
have
helped
me
more
,
and
shared
the
many
thoughts
in
which
I
had
no
partner
;
and
that
this
might
have
been
;
I
knew
.
   
<EOS>
Between
these
two
irreconcilable
conclusions
:
the
one
,
that
what
I
felt
was
general
and
unavoidable
;
the
other
,
that
it
was
particular
to
me
,
and
might
have
been
different
<EOS>
:
I
balanced
curiously
,
with
no
distinct
sense
of
their
opposition
to
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
thought
of
the
airy
dreams
of
youth
that
are
incapable
of
realization
,
I
thought
of
the
better
state
preceding
manhood
that
I
had
outgrown
;
and
then
the
contented
days
with
Agnes
,
in
the
dear
old
house
,
arose
before
me
,
like
spectres
of
the
dead
,
that
might
have
some
renewal
in
another
world
,
but
never
more
could
be
reanimated
here
.
   
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
the
speculation
came
into
my
thoughts
,
What
might
have
happened
,
or
what
would
have
happened
,
if
Dora
and
I
had
never
known
each
other
?
 
<EOS>
But
she
was
so
incorporated
with
my
existence
,
that
it
was
the
idlest
of
all
fancies
,
and
would
soon
rise
out
of
my
reach
and
sight
,
like
gossamer
floating
in
the
air
.
   
<EOS>
I
always
loved
her
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
am
describing
,
slumbered
,
and
half
awoke
,
and
slept
again
,
in
the
innermost
recesses
of
my
mind
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
evidence
of
it
in
me
;
I
know
of
no
influence
it
had
in
anything
I
said
or
did
.
 
<EOS>
I
bore
the
weight
of
all
our
little
cares
,
and
all
my
projects
;
Dora
held
the
pens
;
and
we
both
felt
that
our
shares
were
adjusted
as
the
case
required
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
truly
fond
of
me
,
and
proud
of
me
;
and
when
Agnes
wrote
a
few
earnest
words
in
her
letters
to
Dora
,
of
the
pride
and
interest
with
which
my
old
friends
heard
of
my
growing
reputation
,
and
read
my
book
as
if
they
heard
me
speaking
its
contents
,
Dora
read
them
out
to
me
with
tears
of
joy
in
her
bright
eyes
,
and
said
I
was
a
dear
old
clever
,
famous
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
first
mistaken
impulse
of
an
undisciplined
heart
.
"
 
<EOS>
Those
words
of
Mrs
Strong
's
were
constantly
recurring
to
me
,
at
this
time
;
were
almost
always
present
to
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
awoke
with
them
,
often
,
in
the
night
;
I
remember
to
have
even
read
them
,
in
dreams
,
inscribed
upon
the
walls
of
houses
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
knew
,
now
,
that
my
own
heart
was
undisciplined
when
it
first
loved
Dora
;
and
that
if
it
had
been
disciplined
,
it
never
could
have
felt
,
when
we
were
married
,
what
it
had
felt
in
its
secret
experience
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
can
be
no
disparity
in
marriage
,
like
unsuitability
of
mind
and
purpose
.
"
 
<EOS>
Those
words
I
remembered
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
endeavoured
to
adapt
Dora
to
myself
,
and
found
it
impracticable
.
 
<EOS>
It
remained
for
me
to
adapt
myself
to
Dora
;
to
share
with
her
what
I
could
,
and
be
happy
;
to
bear
on
my
own
shoulders
what
I
must
,
and
be
happy
still
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
discipline
to
which
I
tried
to
bring
my
heart
,
when
I
began
to
think
.
 
<EOS>
It
made
my
second
year
much
happier
than
my
first
;
and
,
what
was
better
still
,
made
Dora
's
life
all
sunshine
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
as
that
year
wore
on
,
Dora
was
not
strong
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
hoped
that
lighter
hands
than
mine
would
help
to
mould
her
character
,
and
that
a
baby
-
smile
upon
her
breast
might
change
my
child
-
wife
to
a
woman
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
The
spirit
fluttered
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
of
its
little
prison
,
and
,
unconscious
of
captivity
,
took
wing
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
can
run
about
again
,
as
I
used
to
do
,
aunt
,
"
said
Dora
,
"
I
shall
make
Jip
race
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
getting
quite
slow
and
lazy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
,
my
dear
,
"
said
my
aunt
quietly
working
by
her
side
,
"
he
has
a
worse
disorder
than
that
.
 
<EOS>
Age
,
Dora
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
he
is
old
?
"
said
Dora
,
astonished
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
how
strange
it
seems
that
Jip
should
be
old
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
complaint
we
are
all
liable
to
,
Little
One
,
as
we
get
on
in
life
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
cheerfully
;
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
feel
more
free
from
it
than
I
used
to
be
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
Jip
,
"
said
Dora
,
looking
at
him
with
compassion
,
"
even
little
Jip
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
he
'll
last
a
long
time
yet
,
Blossom
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
patting
Dora
on
the
cheek
,
as
she
leaned
out
of
her
couch
to
look
at
Jip
,
who
responded
by
standing
on
his
hind
legs
,
and
baulking
himself
in
various
asthmatic
attempts
to
scramble
up
by
the
head
and
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
must
have
a
piece
of
flannel
in
his
house
this
winter
,
and
I
should
n't
wonder
if
he
came
out
quite
fresh
again
,
with
the
flowers
in
the
spring
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
the
little
dog
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
my
aunt
,
"
if
he
had
as
many
lives
as
a
cat
,
and
was
on
the
point
of
losing
'em
all
,
he
'd
bark
at
me
with
his
last
breath
,
I
believe
!
"
   
<EOS>
Dora
had
helped
him
up
on
the
sofa
;
where
he
really
was
defying
my
aunt
to
such
a
furious
extent
,
that
he
could
n't
keep
straight
,
but
barked
himself
sideways
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
my
aunt
looked
at
him
,
the
more
he
reproached
her
;
for
she
had
lately
taken
to
spectacles
,
and
for
some
inscrutable
reason
he
considered
the
glasses
personal
.
   
<EOS>
Dora
made
him
lie
down
by
her
,
with
a
good
deal
of
persuasion
;
and
when
he
was
quiet
,
drew
one
of
his
long
ears
through
and
through
her
hand
,
repeating
thoughtfully
,
"
Even
little
Jip
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
His
lungs
are
good
enough
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
gaily
,
"
and
his
dislikes
are
not
at
all
feeble
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
good
many
years
before
him
,
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
you
want
a
dog
to
race
with
,
Little
Blossom
,
he
has
lived
too
well
for
that
,
and
I
'll
give
you
one
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
aunt
,
"
said
Dora
,
faintly
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
do
n't
,
please
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
?
"
said
my
aunt
,
taking
off
her
spectacles
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
have
any
other
dog
but
Jip
,
"
said
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
so
unkind
to
Jip
!
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
could
n't
be
such
friends
with
any
other
dog
but
Jip
;
because
he
would
n't
have
known
me
before
I
was
married
,
and
would
n't
have
barked
at
Doady
when
he
first
came
to
our
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
care
for
any
other
dog
<EOS>
but
Jip
,
I
am
afraid
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
said
my
aunt
,
patting
her
cheek
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
offended
,
"
said
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
a
sensitive
pet
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
cried
my
aunt
,
bending
over
her
affectionately
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
think
that
I
could
be
offended
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
I
did
n't
really
think
so
,
"
returned
Dora
;
"
but
I
am
a
little
tired
,
and
it
made
me
silly
for
a
moment
---
I
am
always
a
silly
little
thing
,
you
know
,
but
it
made
me
more
silly
---
to
talk
about
Jip
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
known
me
in
all
that
has
happened
to
me
,
have
n't
you
,
Jip
?
 
<EOS>
And
I
could
n't
bear
to
slight
him
,
because
he
was
a
little
altered
---
<EOS>
could
I
,
Jip
?
"
   
<EOS>
Jip
nestled
closer
to
his
mistress
,
and
lazily
licked
her
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
so
old
,
Jip
,
are
you
,
that
you
'll
leave
your
mistress
yet
?
"
said
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
may
keep
one
another
company
a
little
longer
!
"
   
<EOS>
My
pretty
Dora
!
<EOS>
When
she
came
down
to
dinner
on
the
ensuing
Sunday
,
and
was
so
glad
to
see
old
Traddles
(
who
always
dined
with
us
on
Sunday
)
,
we
thought
she
would
be
"
running
about
as
she
used
to
do
"
,
in
a
few
days
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
said
,
wait
a
few
days
more
;
and
then
,
wait
a
few
days
more
;
and
still
she
neither
ran
nor
walked
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
very
pretty
,
and
was
very
merry
;
but
the
little
feet
that
used
to
be
so
nimble
when
they
danced
round
Jip
,
were
dull
and
motionless
.
   
<EOS>
I
began
to
carry
her
downstairs
every
morning
,
and
upstairs
every
night
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
clasp
me
round
the
neck
and
laugh
,
<EOS>
the
while
,
as
if
I
did
it
for
a
wager
.
 
<EOS>
Jip
would
bark
and
caper
round
us
,
and
go
on
before
,
and
look
back
on
the
landing
,
breathing
short
,
to
see
that
we
were
coming
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
the
best
and
most
cheerful
of
nurses
,
would
trudge
after
us
,
a
moving
mass
of
shawls
and
pillows
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
would
not
have
relinquished
his
post
of
candle
-
bearer
to
anyone
alive
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
would
be
often
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
,
looking
on
,
and
taking
charge
of
sportive
messages
from
Dora
to
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
We
made
quite
a
gay
procession
of
it
,
and
my
child
-
wife
was
the
gayest
there
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
sometimes
,
when
I
took
her
up
,
and
felt
that
she
was
lighter
in
my
arms
,
a
dead
blank
feeling
came
upon
me
,
as
if
I
were
approaching
to
some
frozen
region
yet
unseen
,
that
numbed
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
avoided
the
recognition
of
this
feeling
by
any
name
,
or
by
any
communing
with
myself
;
until
one
night
,
when
it
was
very
strong
upon
me
,
and
my
aunt
had
left
her
with
a
parting
cry
of
"
Good
night
,
Little
Blossom
,
"
I
sat
down
at
my
desk
alone
,
and
cried
to
think
,
<EOS>
Oh
what
a
fatal
name
it
was
,
and
how
the
blossom
withered
in
its
bloom
upon
the
tree
!

<EOS>
I
am
involved
in
mystery
 
<EOS>
I
received
one
morning
by
the
post
,
the
following
letter
,
dated
Canterbury
,
and
addressed
to
me
at
Doctor
's
Commons
;
which
I
read
with
some
surprise
:
    
"
MY
DEAR
SIR
,
"
  
"
Circumstances
beyond
my
individual
control
have
,
for
a
considerable
lapse
of
time
,
effected
a
severance
of
that
intimacy
which
,
in
the
limited
opportunities
conceded
to
me
in
the
midst
of
my
professional
duties
,
of
contemplating
the
scenes
and
events
of
the
past
,
tinged
by
the
prismatic
hues
of
memory
,
has
ever
afforded
me
,
as
it
ever
must
continue
to
afford
,
gratifying
emotions
of
no
common
description
.
 
<EOS>
This
fact
,
my
dear
sir
,
combined
with
the
distinguished
elevation
to
which
your
talents
have
raised
you
,
deters
me
from
presuming
to
aspire
to
the
liberty
of
addressing
the
companion
of
my
youth
,
by
the
familiar
appellation
of
Copperfield
!
<EOS>
It
is
sufficient
to
know
that
the
name
to
which
I
do
myself
the
honour
to
refer
,
will
ever
be
treasured
among
the
muniments
of
our
house
<EOS>
(
I
allude
to
the
archives
connected
with
our
former
lodgers
,
preserved
by
Mrs
Micawber
)
,
with
sentiments
of
personal
esteem
amounting
to
affection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
for
one
,
situated
,
through
his
original
errors
and
a
fortuitous
combination
of
unpropitious
events
,
as
is
the
foundered
Bark
(
<EOS>
if
he
may
be
allowed
to
assume
so
maritime
a
denomination
)
,
who
now
takes
up
the
pen
to
address
you
---
it
is
not
,
I
repeat
,
for
one
so
circumstanced
,
to
adopt
the
language
of
compliment
,
or
of
congratulation
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
leaves
to
abler
and
to
purer
hands
.
<EOS>
"

If
your
more
important
avocations
should
admit
of
your
ever
tracing
these
imperfect
characters
thus
far
---
which
may
be
,
or
may
not
be
,
as
circumstances
arise
---
you
will
naturally
inquire
by
what
object
am
I
influenced
,
then
,
in
inditing
the
present
missive
?
<EOS>
Allow
me
to
say
that
I
fully
defer
to
the
reasonable
character
of
that
inquiry
,
and
proceed
to
develop
it
;
premising
that
it
is
not
an
object
of
a
pecuniary
nature
.

Without
more
directly
referring
to
any
latent
ability
that
may
possibly
exist
on
my
part
,
of
wielding
the
thunderbolt
,
or
directing
the
devouring
and
avenging
flame
in
any
quarter
,
I
may
be
permitted
to
observe
,
in
passing
,
that
my
brightest
visions
are
for
ever
dispelled
---
that
my
peace
is
shattered
and
my
power
of
enjoyment
destroyed
---
that
my
heart
is
no
longer
in
the
right
place

I
no
more
walk
erect

my
fellow

will
not

Placed
in
a
mental
position
of
peculiar
painfulness
,
beyond
the
assuaging
reach
even
of
Mrs
Micawber
's
influence
,
though
exercised
in
the
tripartite
character
of
woman

wife

mother

it
is
my
intention
to
fly
from
myself
for
a
short
period

devote
a
respite
of
eight
-
and

forty
hours

revisiting
some

Among

the
extraordinary
relish
with
which
he
sat
down
and
wrote
long
letters
on
all
possible
and
impossible
occasions
,
I
still
believed
that
something
important
lay
hidden
at
the
bottom
of
this
roundabout
communication
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
it
down
,
to
think
about
it
;
and
took
it
up
again
,
to
read
it
once
more
;
and
was
still
pursuing
it
,
when
Traddles
found
me
in
the
height
of
my
perplexity
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
,
"
said
I
,
"
I
never
was
better
pleased
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
You
come
to
give
me
the
benefit
of
your
sober
judgement
at
a
most
opportune
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
received
a
very
singular
letter
,
Traddles
,
from
Mr
Micawber
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
?
"
cried
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
say
so
?
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
received
one
from
Mrs
Micawber
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
,
Traddles
,
who
was
flushed
with
walking
,
and
whose
hair
,
under
the
combined
effects
of
exercise
and
excitement
,
stood
on
end
as
if
he
saw
a
cheerful
ghost
,
produced
his
letter
and
made
an
exchange
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
watched
him
into
the
heart
of
Mr
Micawber
's
letter
,
and
returned
the
elevation
of
eyebrows
with
which
he
said
"
"
Wielding
the
thunderbolt
,
or
directing
the
devouring
and
avenging
flame
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Bless
me
,
Copperfield
!
"
<EOS>
---
and
then
entered
on
the
perusal
of
Mrs
Micawber
's
epistle
.
   
<EOS>
It
ran
thus
:
    
"
<EOS>
My
best
regards
to
Mr
Thomas
Traddles
,
and
if
he
should
still
remember
one
who
formerly
had
the
happiness
of
being
well
acquainted
with
him
,
may
I
beg
a
few
moments
of
his
leisure
time
?
<EOS>
I
assure
Mr
T*T
that
I
would
not
intrude
upon
his
kindness
,
were
I
in
any
other
position
than
on
the
confines
of
distraction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Though
harrowing
to
myself
to
mention
,
the
alienation
of
Mr
Micawber
(
formerly
so
domesticated
)
from
his
wife
and
family
,
is
the
cause
of
<EOS>
my
addressing
my
unhappy
appeal
to
Mr
Traddles
,
and
soliciting
his
best
indulgence
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
T
can
form
no
adequate
idea
of
the
change
in
Mr
Micawber
's
conduct
,
of
his
wildness
,
of
his
violence
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
gradually
augmented
,
until
it
assumes
the
appearance
of
aberration
of
intellect
.
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
a
day
passes
,
I
assure
Mr
Traddles
,
on
which
some
paroxysm
does
not
take
place
.
<EOS>
Mr
T
will
not
require
me
to
depict
my
feelings
,
when
I
inform
him
that
I
have
become
accustomed
to
hear
Mr
Micawber
assert
that
he
has
sold
himself
to
the
D.
 
Mystery
and
secrecy
have
long
been
his
principal
characteristic
,
have
long
replaced
unlimited
confidence
.
<EOS>
The
slightest
provocation
,
even
being
asked
if
there
is
anything
he
would
prefer
for
dinner
,
causes
him
to
express
a
wish
for
a
separation
.
 
<EOS>
Last
night
,
on
being
childishly
solicited
for
twopence
,
to
buy
"
lemon
-
stunners
"
---
a
local
sweetmeat
---
he
presented
an
oyster
-
knife
at
the
twins
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
entreat
Mr
Traddles
to
bear
with
me
in
entering
into
these
details
.
 
<EOS>
Without
them
,
Mr
T
would
indeed
find
it
difficult
to
form
the
faintest
conception
of
my
heart
-
rending
situation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
now
venture
to
confide
to
Mr
T
the
purport
of
my
letter
?
<EOS>
Will
he
now
allow
me
to
throw
myself
on
his
friendly
consideration
?
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
for
I
know
his
heart
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
quick
eye
of
affection
is
not
easily
blinded
,
when
of
the
female
sex
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
is
going
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
Though
he
studiously
concealed
his
hand
,
this
morning
before
breakfast
,
in
writing
the
direction
-
card
which
he
attached
to
the
little
brown
valise
of
happier
days
,
the
eagle
-
glance
of
matrimonial
anxiety
detected
,
d^
,
o^
,
n^
,
distinctly
traced
.
 
<EOS>
The
West
-
End
destination
of
the
coach
,
is
the
Golden
Cross
.
 
<EOS>
Dare
<EOS>
I
fervently
implore
Mr
T
to
see
my
misguided
husband
,
and
to
reason
with
him
?
 
<EOS>
Dare
<EOS>
I
ask
Mr
T
to
endeavour
to
step
in
between
Mr
Micawber
and
his
agonized
family
?
<EOS>
Oh
no
,
for
that
would
be
too
much
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
Mr
Copperfield
should
yet
remember
one
unknown
to
fame
,
will
Mr
T
take
charge
of
my
unalterable
regards
and
similar
entreaties
?
 
<EOS>
In
any
case
,
he
will
have
the
benevolence
to
consider
this
communication
strictly
private
,
and
on
no
account
whatever
to
be
alluded
to
,
however
distantly
,
in
the
presence
of
Mr
Micawber
.
<EOS>
If
Mr
T
should
ever
reply
to
it
(
which
I
can
not
but
feel
to
be
most
improbable
)
,
a
letter
addressed
to
M*E
,
Post
Office
,
Canterbury
,
will
be
fraught
with
less
painful
consequences
than
any
addressed
immediately
to
one
,
who
subscribes
herself
,
in
extreme
distress
,
"
"
Mr
Thomas
Traddles

respectful
friend
and
suppliant
,
"
 
"
EMMA
MICAWBER
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
that
letter
?
"
said
Traddles
,
casting
his
eyes
upon
me
,
when
I
had
read
it
twice
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
the
other
?
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
For
he
was
still
reading
it
with
knitted
brows
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
the
two
together
,
Copperfield
,
"
replied
Traddles
,
"
mean
more
than
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
usually
mean
in
their
correspondence
---
but
I
do
n't
know
what
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
both
written
in
good
faith
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
and
without
any
collusion
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
thing
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
was
now
alluding
to
Mrs
Micawber
's
letter
,
and
we
were
standing
side
by
side
comparing
the
two
;
"
it
will
be
a
charity
to
write
to
her
,
at
all
events
,
and
tell
her
that
we
will
not
fail
to
see
Mr
Micawber
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
acceded
to
this
the
more
readily
,
because
I
now
reproached
myself
with
having
treated
her
former
letter
rather
lightly
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
set
me
thinking
a
good
deal
at
the
time
,
as
I
have
mentioned
in
its
place
;
but
my
absorption
in
my
own
affairs
,
my
experience
of
the
family
,
and
my
hearing
nothing
more
,
had
gradually
ended
in
my
dismissing
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
often
thought
of
the
Micawbers
,
but
chiefly
to
wonder
what
"
pecuniary
liabilities
"
they
were
establishing
in
Canterbury
,
and
to
recall
how
shy
Mr
Micawber
was
of
me
when
he
became
clerk
to
Uriah
Heep
.
   
<EOS>
However
,
I
now
wrote
a
comforting
letter
to
Mrs
Micawber
,
in
our
joint
names
,
and
we
both
signed
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
walked
into
town
to
post
it
,
Traddles
and
I
held
a
long
conference
,
and
launched
into
a
number
of
speculations
,
which
I
need
not
repeat
.
 
<EOS>
We
took
my
aunt
into
our
counsels
in
the
afternoon
;
but
our
only
decided
conclusion
was
,
that
we
would
be
very
punctual
in
keeping
Mr
Micawber
's
appointment
.
   
<EOS>
Although
we
appeared
at
the
stipulated
place
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
time
,
we
found
Mr
Micawber
already
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
standing
with
his
arms
folded
,
over
against
the
wall
,
looking
at
the
spikes
on
the
top
,
with
a
sentimental
expression
,
as
if
they
were
the
interlacing
boughs
of
trees
that
had
shaded
him
in
his
youth
.
   
<EOS>
When
we
accosted
him
,
his
manner
was
something
more
confused
,
and
something
less
genteel
,
than
of
yore
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
relinquished
his
legal
suit
of
black
for
the
purposes
of
this
excursion
,
and
wore
the
old
surtout
and
tights
,
but
not
quite
with
the
old
air
.
 
<EOS>
He
gradually
picked
up
more
and
more
of
it
as
we
conversed
with
him
;
but
,
his
very
eye
-
glass
seemed
to
hang
less
easily
,
and
his
shirt
-
collar
,
though
still
of
the
old
formidable
dimensions
,
rather
drooped
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
after
the
first
salutations
,
"
you
are
friends
in
need
,
and
friends
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Allow
me
to
offer
my
inquiries
with
reference
to
the
physical
welfare
of
Mrs
Copperfield
in
esse
,
and
Mrs
Traddles
in
posse
,
---
presuming
<EOS>
,
that
is
to
say
,
that
my
friend
Mr
Traddles
is
not
yet
united
to
the
object
of
his
affections
,
for
weal
and
for
woe
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
acknowledged
his
politeness
,
and
made
suitable
replies
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
directed
our
attention
to
the
wall
,
and
was
beginning
,
"
I
assure
you
,
gentlemen
,
"
when
I
ventured
to
object
to
that
ceremonious
form
of
address
,
and
to
beg
that
he
would
speak
to
us
in
the
old
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Copperfield
,
"
he
returned
,
pressing
my
hand
,
"
your
cordiality
overpowers
me
.
 
<EOS>
This
reception
of
a
shattered
fragment
of
the
Temple
once
called
Man
---
if
I
may
be
permitted
so
to
express
myself
---
bespeaks
a
heart
that
is
an
honour
to
our
common
nature
.
<EOS>
I
was
about
to
observe
that
I
again
behold
the
serene
spot
where
some
of
the
happiest
hours
of
my
existence
fleeted
by
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Made
so
,
I
am
sure
,
by
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
is
well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
returned
Mr
Micawber
,
whose
face
clouded
at
this
reference
,
"
she
is
but
so
<EOS>
-
so
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
nodding
his
head
sorrowfully
,
"
is
the
Bench
!
<EOS>
Where
,
for
the
first
time
in
many
revolving
years
,
the
overwhelming
pressure
of
pecuniary
liabilities
was
not
proclaimed
,
from
day
to
day
,
by
importune
voices
declining
to
vacate
the
passage
;
where
there
was
no
knocker
on
the
door
for
any
creditor
to
appeal
to
;
where
personal
service
of
process
was
not
required
,
and
detainees
were
merely
lodged
at
the
gate
!
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
when
the
shadow
of
that
iron
-
work
on
the
summit
of
the
brick
structure
has
been
reflected
on
the
gravel
of
the
Parade
<EOS>
,
I
have
seen
my
children
thread
the
mazes
of
the
intricate
pattern
,
avoiding
the
dark
marks
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
familiar
with
every
stone
in
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
betray
weakness
,
you
will
know
how
to
excuse
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
all
got
on
in
life
since
then
,
Mr
Micawber
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
returned
Mr
Micawber
,
bitterly
,
"
when
I
was
an
inmate
of
that
retreat
<EOS>
I
could
look
my
fellow
-
man
in
the
face
,
and
punch
his
head
if
he
offended
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
fellow
-
man
and
myself
are
no
longer
on
those
glorious
terms
!
"
   
<EOS>
Turning
from
the
building
in
a
downcast
manner
,
Mr
Micawber
accepted
my
proffered
arm
on
one
side
,
and
the
proffered
arm
of
Traddles
on
the
other
,
and
walked
away
between
us
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
are
some
landmarks
,
"
observed
Mr
Micawber
,
looking
fondly
back
over
his
shoulder
,
"
on
the
road
to
the
tomb
,
<EOS>
which
,
but
for
the
impiety
of
the
aspiration
,
a
man
would
wish
never
to
have
passed
.
 
<EOS>
Such
is
the
Bench
in
my
chequered
career
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
are
in
low
spirits
,
Mr
Micawber
,
"
said
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
sir
,
"
interposed
Mr
Micawber
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
it
is
not
because
you
have
conceived
a
dislike
to
the
law
---
for
I
am
a
lawyer
myself
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
answered
not
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
is
our
friend
Heep
,
Mr
Micawber
?
"
said
I
,
after
a
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Copperfield
,
"
returned
Mr
Micawber
,
bursting
into
a
state
of
much
excitement
,
and
turning
pale
,
"
if
you
ask
after
my
employer
as
your
friend
,
I
am
sorry
for
it
;
if
you
ask
after
him
as
MY
friend
,
I
sardonically
smile
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
whatever
capacity
you
ask
after
my
employer
,
I
beg
,
without
offence
to
you
,
to
limit
my
reply
to
this
---
that
whatever
his
state
of
health
may
be
,
his
appearance
is
foxy
:
not
to
say
diabolical
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
allow
me
,
as
a
private
individual
,
to
decline
pursuing
a
subject
which
has
lashed
me
to
the
utmost
verge
of
desperation
in
my
professional
capacity
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
expressed
my
regret
for
having
innocently
touched
upon
a
theme
that
roused
him
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
,
"
said
I
,
"
without
any
hazard
of
repeating
the
mistake
,
how
my
old
friends
Mr
and
Miss
Wickfield
are
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Wickfield
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
now
turning
red
,
"
is
,
as
she
always
is
,
a
pattern
,
and
a
bright
example
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Copperfield
,
she
is
the
only
starry
spot
in
a
miserable
existence
.
 
<EOS>
My
respect
for
that
young
lady
,
my
admiration
of
her
character
,
my
devotion
to
her
for
her
love
and
truth
,
and
goodness
!
<EOS>
---
Take
me
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
down
a
turning
,
for
,
upon
my
soul
,
in
my
present
state
of
mind
<EOS>
I
am
not
equal
to
this
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
wheeled
him
off
into
a
narrow
street
,
where
he
took
out
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
and
stood
with
his
back
to
a
wall
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
looked
as
gravely
at
him
as
Traddles
did
,
he
must
have
found
our
company
by
no
means
inspiriting
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
fate
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
unfeignedly
sobbing
,
but
doing
even
that
,
with
a
shadow
of
the
old
expression
of
doing
something
genteel
;
"
it
is
my
fate
,
gentlemen
,
that
the
finer
feelings
of
our
nature
have
become
reproaches
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
homage
to
Miss
Wickfield
,
is
a
flight
of
arrows
in
my
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
better
leave
me
,
if
you
please
,
to
walk
the
earth
as
a
vagabond
.
 
<EOS>
The
worm
will
settle
my
business
in
double
-
quick
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
Without
attending
to
this
invocation
,
we
stood
by
,
until
he
put
up
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
pulled
up
his
shirt
-
collar
,
and
,
to
delude
any
person
in
the
neighbourhood
who
might
have
been
observing
him
,
hummed
a
tune
with
his
hat
very
much
on
one
side
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
mentioned
---
not
knowing
what
might
be
lost
if
we
lost
sight
of
him
yet
---
that
it
would
give
me
great
pleasure
to
introduce
him
to
my
aunt
,
if
he
would
ride
out
to
Highgate
,
where
a
bed
was
at
his
service
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
make
us
a
glass
of
your
own
punch
,
Mr
Micawber
,
"
said
I
,
"
and
forget
whatever
you
have
on
your
mind
,
in
pleasanter
reminiscences
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Or
,
if
confiding
anything
to
friends
will
be
more
likely
to
relieve
you
,
you
shall
impart
it
to
us
,
Mr
Micawber
,
"
said
Traddles
,
prudently
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
returned
Mr
Micawber
,
"
do
with
me
as
you
will
!
<EOS>
I
am
a
straw
upon
the
surface
of
the
deep
,
and
am
tossed
in
all
directions
by
the
elephants
---
I
beg
your
pardon
;
I
should
have
said
the
elements
.
"
   
<EOS>
We
walked
on
,
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
again
;
found
the
coach
in
the
act
of
starting
;
and
arrived
at
Highgate
without
encountering
any
difficulties
by
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
very
uneasy
and
very
uncertain
in
my
mind
what
to
say
or
do
for
the
best
---
so
was
Traddles
,
evidently
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
was
for
the
most
part
plunged
into
deep
gloom
.
 
<EOS>
He
occasionally
made
an
attempt
to
smarten
himself
,
and
hum
the
fag
-
end
of
a
tune
;
but
his
relapses
into
profound
melancholy
were
only
made
the
more
impressive
by
the
mockery
of
a
hat
exceedingly
on
one
side
,
and
a
shirt
-
collar
pulled
up
to
his
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
We
went
to
my
aunt
's
house
rather
than
to
mine
,
because
of
Dora
's
not
being
well
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
presented
herself
on
being
sent
for
,
and
welcomed
Mr
Micawber
with
gracious
cordiality
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
kissed
her
hand
,
retired
to
the
window
,
and
pulling
out
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
had
a
mental
wrestle
with
himself
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
was
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
by
nature
so
exceedingly
compassionate
of
anyone
who
seemed
to
be
ill
at
ease
,
and
was
so
quick
to
find
any
such
person
out
,
that
he
shook
hands
with
Mr
Micawber
,
at
least
half
-
a
-
dozen
times
in
five
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
To
Mr
Micawber
,
in
his
trouble
,
this
warmth
,
on
the
part
of
a
stranger
,
was
so
extremely
touching
,
that
he
could
only
say
,
on
the
occasion
of
each
successive
shake
,
"
My
dear
sir
,
you
overpower
me
!
"
<EOS>
Which
gratified
Mr
Dick
so
much
,
that
he
went
at
it
again
with
greater
vigour
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
friendliness
of
this
gentleman
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
to
my
aunt
,
"
if
you
will
allow
me
,
ma'am
,
to
cull
a
figure
of
speech
from
the
vocabulary
of
our
coarser
national
sports
---
floors
me
.
 
<EOS>
To
a
man
who
is
struggling
with
a
complicated
burden
of
perplexity
and
disquiet
,
such
a
reception
is
trying
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
friend
Mr
Dick
,
"
replied
my
aunt
proudly
,
"
is
not
a
common
man
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
I
am
convinced
of
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sir
!
"
<EOS>
for
Mr
Dick
was
shaking
hands
with
him
again
;
"
I
am
deeply
sensible
of
your
cordiality
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
find
yourself
?
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
with
an
anxious
look
.
   
<EOS>
"
Indifferent
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Micawber
,
sighing
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
keep
up
your
spirits
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
"
and
make
yourself
as
comfortable
as
possible
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
was
quite
overcome
by
these
friendly
words
,
and
by
finding
Mr
Dick
's
hand
again
within
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
my
lot
,
"
he
observed
,
"
to
meet
,
in
the
diversified
panorama
of
human
existence
,
with
an
occasional
oasis
,
but
never
with
one
so
green
,
so
gushing
,
as
the
present
!
"
   
<EOS>
At
another
time
I
should
have
been
amused
by
this
;
but
I
felt
that
we
were
all
constrained
and
uneasy
,
and
I
watched
Mr
Micawber
so
anxiously
,
in
his
vacillations
between
an
evident
disposition
to
reveal
something
,
and
a
counter
-
disposition
to
reveal
nothing
,
that
I
was
in
a
perfect
fever
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
,
sitting
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
,
with
his
eyes
wide
open
,
and
his
hair
more
emphatically
erect
than
ever
,
stared
by
turns
at
the
ground
and
at
Mr
Micawber
,
without
so
much
as
attempting
to
put
in
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
though
I
saw
that
her
shrewdest
observation
was
concentrated
on
her
new
guest
,
had
more
useful
possession
of
her
wits
than
either
of
us
;
for
she
held
him
in
conversation
,
and
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
talk
,
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
very
old
friend
of
my
nephew
's
,
Mr
Micawber
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
returned
Mr
Micawber
,
"
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
had
the
honour
of
knowing
you
at
an
earlier
period
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
always
the
wreck
you
at
present
behold
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
Mrs
Micawber
and
your
family
are
well
,
sir
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
inclined
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
as
well
,
ma'am
,
<EOS>
"
he
desperately
observed
after
a
pause
,
"
as
Aliens
and
Outcasts
can
ever
hope
to
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
you
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
my
aunt
,
in
her
abrupt
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
talking
about
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
subsistence
of
my
family
,
ma'am
,
"
returned
Mr
Micawber
,
"
trembles
in
the
balance
.
 
<EOS>
My
employer
---
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Micawber
provokingly
left
off
;
and
began
to
peel
the
lemons
that
had
been
under
my
directions
set
before
him
,
together
with
all
the
other
appliances
he
used
in
making
punch
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
employer
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mr
Dick
,
jogging
his
arm
as
a
gentle
reminder
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
good
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Micawber
,
"
you
recall
me
,
I
am
obliged
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
shook
hands
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
employer
,
ma'am
---
Mr
Heep
---
once
did
me
the
favour
to
observe
to
me
,
that
if
I
were
not
in
the
receipt
of
the
stipendiary
emoluments
appertaining
to
my
engagement
with
him
,
I
should
probably
be
a
mountebank
about
the
country
,
swallowing
a
sword
-
blade
,
and
eating
the
devouring
element
.
 
<EOS>
For
anything
that
I
can
perceive
to
the
contrary
,
it
is
still
probable
that
my
children
may
be
reduced
to
seek
a
livelihood
by
personal
contortion
,
while
Mrs
Micawber
abets
their
unnatural
feats
by
playing
the
barrel
-
organ
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
with
a
random
but
expressive
flourish
of
his
knife
,
signified
that
these
performances
might
be
expected
to
take
place
after
he
was
no
more
;
then
resumed
his
peeling
with
a
desperate
air
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
leaned
her
elbow
on
the
little
round
table
that
she
usually
kept
beside
her
,
and
eyed
him
attentively
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
aversion
with
which
I
regarded
the
idea
of
entrapping
him
into
any
disclosure
he
was
not
prepared
to
make
voluntarily
,
I
should
have
taken
him
up
at
this
point
,
but
for
the
strange
proceedings
in
which
I
saw
him
engaged
;
whereof
his
putting
the
lemon
-
peel
into
the
kettle
,
the
sugar
into
the
snuffer
-
tray
,
the
spirit
into
the
empty
jug
,
and
confidently
attempting
to
pour
boiling
water
out
of
a
candlestick
,
were
among
the
most
remarkable
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
that
a
crisis
was
at
hand
,
and
it
came
.
 
<EOS>
He
clattered
all
his
means
and
implements
together
,
rose
from
his
chair
,
pulled
out
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
and
burst
into
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
behind
his
handkerchief
,
"
this
is
an
occupation
,
of
all
others
,
requiring
an
untroubled
mind
,
and
self
-
respect
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
perform
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
out
of
the
question

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Micawber
,
"
said
I
,
"
what
is
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
speak
out

<EOS>
You

friends

<EOS>
"
Among
friends

sir

"
repeated
Mr
Micawber
;
and
all
he
had
reserved
came
breaking
out
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
heavens
,
it
is
principally
because
I
AM
among
friends

my
state

Villainy

MY
aunt
clapped
her
hands
,
and
we
all
started
up
as
if
we
were
possessed
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
struggle
is
over

"
said
Mr
Micawber
violently
gesticulating
with
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
and
fairly
striking
out
from
time
to
time
with
both
arms
,
as
if
he
were
swimming
under
superhuman
difficulties
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
lead
this
life
no

am
a
wretched
being

cut
off

Give

petty
wretch

walks
about

call
upon
me
to
swallow
a
sword
tomorrow

I

do
it

<EOS>
With
an
appetite

<EOS>
I
never
saw
a
man
so
hot
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
tried
to
calm
him
,
that
we
might
come
to
something
rational
;
but
he
got
hotter
and
hotter
,
and
would
n't
hear
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
put
my
hand

said
Mr
Micawber
,
gasping
,
puffing
,
and
sobbing
,
to
that
degree
that
he
was
like
a
man
fighting
with
cold
water

I
really
had
some
fear

Mr
Micawber

dying
on
the
spot

<EOS>
The
manner
in
which
he
struggled
through
these
inarticulate
sentences
,
and
,
whenever
he
found
himself
getting
near
the
name
of
Heep
,
fought
his
way
on
to
it
,
dashed
at
it
in
a
fainting
state
,
and
brought
it
out
with
a
vehemence
little
less
than
marvellous
,
was
frightful
;
but
now
,
when
he
sank
into
a
chair
,
steaming
,
and
looked
at
us
,
with
every
possible
colour
in
his
face
that
had
no
business
there

and
an
endless
procession
of
lumps
following
one
another
in
hot
haste
up
his
throat
,
whence
they
seemed
to
shoot
into

he
had
the
appearance

being
in

last
extremity

I
would
have
gone
to
his
assistance

he
waved
me
off

convinced

With
this
last
repetition
of
the
magic
word
that
had
kept
him
going
at
all
,
and
in
which
he
surpassed
all
his
previous
efforts
,
Mr
Micawber
rushed
out
of
the
house
;
leaving
us
in
a
state
of
excitement
,
hope
,
and
wonder
,
that
reduced
us
to
a
condition
little
better
than
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
But
even
then
his
passion
for
writing
letters
was
too
strong
to
be
resisted
;
for
while
we
were
yet
in
the
height
of
our
excitement
,
hope
,
and
wonder
,
the
following
pastoral
note
was
brought
to
me
from
a
neighbouring
tavern
,
at
which
he
had
called
to
write
it
:

MY

your

my
late
excitement

An

I
rendered
tolerably

my

Mrs

Chapter
50
.
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
's
dream
comes
true
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
some
months
had
passed
since
our
interview
on
the
bank
of
the
river
with
Martha
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
never
seen
her
since
,
but
she
had
communicated
with
Mr
Peggotty
on
several
occasions
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
had
come
of
her
zealous
intervention
;
nor
could
I
infer
,
from
what
he
told
me
,
that
any
clue
had
been
obtained
,
for
a
moment
,
to
Emily
's
fate
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
that
I
began
to
despair
of
her
recovery
,
and
gradually
to
sink
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
belief
that
she
was
dead
.
   
<EOS>
His
conviction
remained
unchanged
.
 
<EOS>
So
far
as
I
know
---
and
I
believe
his
honest
heart
was
transparent
to
me
---
he
never
wavered
again
,
in
his
solemn
certainty
of
finding
her
.
 
<EOS>
His
patience
never
tired
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
although
I
trembled
for
the
agony
it
might
one
day
be
to
him
to
have
his
strong
assurance
shivered
at
a
blow
<EOS>
,
there
was
something
so
religious
in
it
,
so
affectingly
expressive
of
its
anchor
being
in
the
purest
depths
of
his
fine
nature
,
that
the
respect
and
honour
in
which
I
held
him
were
exalted
every
day
.
   
<EOS>
His
was
not
a
lazy
trustfulness
that
hoped
,
and
did
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
man
of
sturdy
action
all
his
life
,
and
he
knew
that
in
all
things
wherein
he
wanted
help
he
must
do
his
own
part
faithfully
,
and
help
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
known
him
set
out
in
the
night
,
on
a
misgiving
that
the
light
might
not
be
,
by
some
accident
,
in
the
window
of
the
old
boat
,
and
walk
to
Yarmouth
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
known
him
,
on
reading
something
in
the
newspaper
that
might
apply
to
her
,
take
up
his
stick
,
and
go
forth
on
a
journey
of
three
or
four
score
miles
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
his
way
by
sea
to
Naples
,
and
back
,
after
hearing
the
narrative
to
which
Miss
Dartle
had
assisted
me
.
 
<EOS>
All
his
journeys
were
ruggedly
performed
;
for
he
was
always
steadfast
in
a
purpose
of
saving
money
for
Emily
's
sake
,
when
she
should
be
found
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
this
long
pursuit
,
I
never
heard
him
repine
;
I
never
heard
him
say
he
was
fatigued
,
or
out
of
heart
.
   
<EOS>
Dora
had
often
seen
him
since
our
marriage
,
and
was
quite
fond
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
his
figure
before
me
now
,
standing
near
her
sofa
,
with
his
rough
cap
in
his
hand
,
and
the
blue
eyes
of
my
child
-
wife
raised
,
with
a
timid
wonder
,
to
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
of
an
evening
,
about
twilight
,
when
he
came
to
talk
with
me
,
I
would
induce
him
to
smoke
his
pipe
in
the
garden
,
as
we
slowly
paced
to
and
fro
together
;
and
then
,
the
picture
of
his
deserted
home
,
and
the
comfortable
air
it
used
to
have
in
my
childish
eyes
of
an
evening
when
the
fire
was
burning
,
and
the
wind
moaning
round
it
,
came
most
vividly
into
my
mind
.
   
<EOS>
One
evening
,
at
this
hour
,
he
told
me
that
he
had
found
Martha
waiting
near
his
lodging
on
the
preceding
night
when
he
came
out
,
and
that
she
had
asked
him
not
to
leave
London
on
any
account
,
until
he
should
have
seen
her
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
she
tell
you
why
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
asked
her
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
he
replied
,
"
but
it
is
but
few
words
as
she
ever
says
,
and
she
on'y
got
my
promise
and
so
went
away
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
she
say
when
you
might
expect
to
see
her
again
?
<EOS>
"
I
demanded
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mas'r
Davy
<EOS>
,
"
he
returned
,
drawing
his
hand
thoughtfully
down
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
asked
that
too
;
but
it
was
more
(
she
said
)
than
she
could
tell
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
I
had
long
forborne
to
encourage
him
with
hopes
that
hung
on
threads
,
I
made
no
other
comment
on
this
information
than
that
I
supposed
he
would
see
her
soon
.
 
<EOS>
Such
speculations
as
it
engendered
within
me
<EOS>
I
kept
to
myself
,
and
those
were
faint
enough
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
walking
alone
in
the
garden
,
one
evening
,
about
a
fortnight
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
that
evening
well
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
second
in
Mr
Micawber
's
week
of
suspense
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
been
rain
all
day
,
and
there
was
a
damp
feeling
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
The
leaves
were
thick
upon
the
trees
,
and
heavy
with
wet
;
but
the
rain
had
ceased
,
though
the
sky
was
still
dark
;
and
the
hopeful
birds
were
singing
cheerfully
.
<EOS>
As
I
walked
to
and
fro
in
the
garden
,
and
the
twilight
began
to
close
around
me
,
their
little
voices
were
hushed
;
and
that
peculiar
silence
which
belongs
to
such
an
evening
in
the
country
when
the
lightest
trees
are
quite
still
,
save
for
the
occasional
droppings
from
their
boughs
,
prevailed
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
green
perspective
of
trellis
-
work
and
ivy
at
the
side
of
our
cottage
,
through
which
I
could
see
,
from
the
garden
where
I
was
walking
,
into
the
road
before
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
happened
to
turn
my
eyes
towards
this
place
,
as
I
was
thinking
of
many
things
;
and
I
saw
a
figure
beyond
,
dressed
in
a
plain
cloak
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
bending
eagerly
towards
me
,
and
beckoning
.
   
<EOS>
"
Martha
!
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
going
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
you
come
with
me
?
"
<EOS>
she
inquired
,
in
an
agitated
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
to
him
,
and
he
is
not
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
wrote
down
where
he
was
to
come
,
and
left
it
on
his
table
with
my
own
hand
.
 
<EOS>
They
said
he
would
not
be
out
long
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
tidings
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
come
directly
?
"
   
<EOS>
My
answer
was
,
to
pass
out
at
the
gate
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
She
made
a
hasty
gesture
with
her
hand
,
as
if
to
entreat
my
patience
and
my
silence
,
and
turned
towards
London
,
whence
,
as
her
dress
betokened
,
she
had
come
expeditiously
on
foot
.
   
<EOS>
I
asked
her
if
that
were
not
our
destination
?
 
<EOS>
On
her
motioning
<EOS>
Yes
,
with
the
same
hasty
gesture
as
before
,
I
stopped
an
empty
coach
that
was
coming
by
,
and
we
got
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
asked
her
where
the
coachman
was
to
drive
,
she
answered
,
"
Anywhere
near
Golden
Square
!
<EOS>
And
quick
!
"
<EOS>
---
then
shrunk
into
a
corner
,
with
one
trembling
hand
before
her
face
,
and
the
other
making
the
former
gesture
,
as
if
she
could
not
bear
a
voice
.
   
<EOS>
Now
much
disturbed
,
and
dazzled
with
conflicting
gleams
of
hope
and
dread
,
I
looked
at
her
for
some
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
But
seeing
how
strongly
she
desired
to
remain
quiet
,
and
feeling
that
it
was
my
own
natural
inclination
too
,
at
such
a
time
,
I
did
not
attempt
to
break
the
silence
.
 
<EOS>
We
proceeded
without
a
word
being
spoken
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
she
glanced
out
of
the
window
,
as
though
she
thought
we
were
going
slowly
,
though
indeed
we
were
going
fast
;
but
otherwise
remained
exactly
as
at
first
.
   
<EOS>
We
alighted
at
one
of
the
entrances
to
the
Square
she
had
mentioned
,
where
I
directed
the
coach
to
wait
,
not
knowing
but
that
we
might
have
some
occasion
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
laid
her
hand
on
my
arm
,
and
hurried
me
on
to
one
of
the
sombre
streets
,
of
which
there
are
several
in
that
part
,
where
the
houses
were
once
fair
dwellings
in
the
occupation
of
single
families
,
but
have
,
and
had
,
long
degenerated
into
poor
lodgings
let
off
in
rooms
.
 
<EOS>
Entering
at
the
open
door
of
one
of
these
,
and
releasing
my
arm
,
she
beckoned
me
to
follow
her
up
the
common
staircase
,
which
was
like
a
tributary
channel
to
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
The
house
swarmed
with
inmates
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
went
up
,
doors
of
rooms
were
opened
and
people
's
heads
put
out
;
and
we
passed
other
people
on
the
stairs
,
who
were
coming
down
.
 
<EOS>
In
glancing
up
from
the
outside
,
before
we
entered
,
I
had
seen
women
and
children
lolling
at
the
windows
over
flower
-
pots
;
and
we
seemed
to
have
attracted
their
curiosity
,
for
these
were
principally
the
observers
who
looked
out
of
their
doors
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
broad
panelled
staircase
,
with
massive
balustrades
of
some
dark
wood
;
cornices
above
the
doors
,
ornamented
with
carved
fruit
and
flowers
;
and
broad
seats
in
the
windows
.
 
<EOS>
But
all
these
tokens
of
past
grandeur
were
miserably
decayed
and
dirty
;
<EOS>
rot
,
damp
,
and
age
,
had
weakened
the
flooring
,
which
in
many
places
was
unsound
and
even
unsafe
.
 
<EOS>
Some
attempts
had
been
made
,
I
noticed
,
to
infuse
new
blood
into
this
dwindling
frame
,
by
repairing
the
costly
old
wood
-
work
here
and
there
with
common
deal
;
but
it
was
like
the
marriage
of
a
reduced
old
noble
to
a
plebeian
pauper
,
and
each
party
to
the
ill
-
assorted
union
shrunk
away
from
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Several
of
the
back
windows
on
the
staircase
had
been
darkened
or
wholly
blocked
up
.
 
<EOS>
In
those
that
remained
,
there
was
scarcely
any
glass
;
and
,
through
the
crumbling
frames
by
which
the
bad
air
seemed
always
to
come
in
,
and
never
to
go
out
,
I
saw
,
through
other
glassless
windows
,
into
other
houses
in
a
similar
condition
,
and
looked
giddily
down
into
a
wretched
yard
,
which
was
the
common
dust
-
heap
of
the
mansion
.
   
<EOS>
We
proceeded
to
the
top
-
storey
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Two
or
three
times
,
by
the
way
,
I
thought
I
observed
in
the
indistinct
light
the
skirts
of
a
female
figure
going
up
before
us
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
turned
to
ascend
the
last
flight
of
stairs
between
us
and
the
roof
,
we
caught
a
full
view
of
this
figure
pausing
for
a
moment
,
at
a
door
.
 
<EOS>
Then
it
turned
the
handle
,
and
went
in
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
this
!
"
<EOS>
said
Martha
,
in
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
gone
into
my
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
knew
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
recognized
her
with
amazement
,
for
Miss
Dartle
.
   
<EOS>
I
said
something
to
the
effect
that
it
was
a
lady
whom
I
had
seen
before
,
in
a
few
words
,
to
my
conductress
;
and
had
scarcely
done
so
,
when
we
heard
her
voice
in
the
room
,
though
not
,
from
where
we
stood
,
what
she
was
saying
.
 
<EOS>
Martha
,
with
an
astonished
look
,
repeated
her
former
action
,
and
softly
led
me
up
the
stairs
;
and
then
,
by
a
little
back
-
door
which
seemed
to
have
no
lock
,
and
which
she
pushed
open
with
a
touch
,
into
a
small
empty
garret
with
a
low
sloping
roof
,
little
better
than
a
cupboard
.
 
<EOS>
Between
this
,
and
the
room
she
had
called
hers
,
there
was
a
small
door
of
communication
,
standing
partly
open
.
 
<EOS>
Here
we
stopped
,
breathless
with
our
ascent
,
and
she
placed
her
hand
lightly
on
my
lips
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
only
see
,
of
the
room
beyond
,
that
it
was
pretty
large
;
that
there
was
a
bed
in
it
;
and
that
there
were
some
common
pictures
of
ships
upon
the
walls
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
Miss
Dartle
,
or
the
person
whom
we
had
heard
her
address
.
 
<EOS>
Certainly
,
my
companion
could
not
,
for
my
position
was
the
best
.
<EOS>
A
dead
silence
prevailed
for
some
moments
.
 
<EOS>
Martha
kept
one
hand
on
my
lips
,
and
raised
the
other
in
a
listening
attitude
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
matters
little
to
me
<EOS>
her
not
being
at
home
,
"
said
Rosa
Dartle
haughtily
,
"
I
know
nothing
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
you
<EOS>
I
come
to
see
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Me
?
"
replied
a
soft
voice
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
sound
of
it
,
a
thrill
went
through
my
frame
.
 
<EOS>
For
it
was
Emily
's
!
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
returned
Miss
Dartle
,
"
I
have
come
to
look
at
you
.
 
<EOS>
What
?
<EOS>
You
are
not
ashamed
of
the
face
that
has
done
so
much
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
resolute
and
unrelenting
hatred
of
her
tone
,
its
cold
stern
sharpness
,
and
its
mastered
rage
,
presented
her
before
me
,
as
if
I
had
seen
her
standing
in
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
the
flashing
black
eyes
,
and
the
passion
-
wasted
figure
;
and
I
saw
the
scar
,
with
its
white
track
cutting
through
her
lips
,
quivering
and
throbbing
as
she
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
to
see
,
"
she
said
,
"
James
Steerforth
's
fancy
;
the
girl
who
ran
away
with
him
,
and
is
the
town
-
talk
of
the
commonest
people
of
her
native
place
;
the
bold
,
flaunting
,
practised
companion
of
persons
like
James
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
what
such
a
thing
is
like
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
rustle
,
as
if
the
unhappy
girl
,
on
whom
she
heaped
these
taunts
,
ran
towards
the
door
,
and
the
speaker
swiftly
interposed
herself
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
succeeded
by
a
moment
's
pause
.
   
<EOS>
When
Miss
Dartle
spoke
again
,
it
was
through
her
set
teeth
,
and
with
a
stamp
upon
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
there
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
or
I
'll
proclaim
you
to
the
house
,
and
the
whole
street
!
<EOS>
If
you
try
to
evade
me
,
I
'll
stop
you
,
if
it
's
by
the
hair
,
and
raise
the
very
stones
against
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
A
frightened
murmur
was
the
only
reply
that
reached
my
ears
.
 
<EOS>
A
silence
succeeded
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Much
as
I
desired
to
put
an
end
to
the
interview
,
I
felt
that
I
had
no
right
to
present
myself
;
that
it
was
for
Mr
Peggotty
alone
to
see
her
and
recover
her
.
 
<EOS>
Would
he
never
come
?
 
<EOS>
I
thought
impatiently
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
!
"
said
Rosa
Dartle
,
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
,
"
I
see
her
at
last
!
<EOS>
Why
,
he
was
a
poor
creature
to
be
taken
by
that
delicate
mock
-
modesty
,
and
that
hanging
head
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
spare
me
!
"
exclaimed
Emily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whoever
you
are
,
you
know
my
pitiable
story
,
and
for
Heaven
's
sake
spare
me
,
if
you
would
be
spared
yourself
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
would
be
spared
!
"
returned
the
other
fiercely
;
"
what
is
there
in
common
between
US
,
do
you
think
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
but
our
sex
,
"
said
Emily
,
with
a
burst
of
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
,
"
said
Rosa
Dartle
,
"
is
so
strong
a
claim
,
preferred
by
one
so
infamous
,
that
if
I
had
any
feeling
in
my
breast
but
scorn
and
abhorrence
of
you
,
it
would
freeze
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
Our
sex
!
<EOS>
You
are
an
honour
to
our
sex
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
deserved
this
,
"
said
Emily
,
"
but
<EOS>
it
's
dreadful
!
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
lady
,
think
what
I
have
suffered
,
and
how
I
am
fallen
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
Martha
,
come
back
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
home
,
home
!
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Dartle
placed
herself
in
a
chair
,
within
view
of
the
door
,
and
looked
downward
,
as
if
Emily
were
crouching
on
the
floor
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
Being
now
between
me
and
the
light
,
I
could
see
her
curled
lip
,
and
her
cruel
eyes
intently
fixed
on
one
place
,
with
a
greedy
triumph
.
   
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
what
I
say
!
<EOS>
"
she
said
;
"
and
reserve
your
false
arts
for
your
dupes
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hope
to
move
me
by
your
tears
?
 
<EOS>
No
more
than
you
could
charm
me
by
your
smiles
,
you
purchased
slave
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
have
some
mercy
on
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Emily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Show
me
some
compassion
,
or
I
shall
die
mad
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
no
great
penance
,
"
said
Rosa
Dartle
,
"
for
your
crimes
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
what
you
have
done
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
ever
think
of
the
home
<EOS>
you
have
laid
waste
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
is
there
ever
night
or
day
,
when
I
do
n't
think
of
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Emily
;
and
now
I
could
just
see
her
,
on
her
knees
,
with
her
head
thrown
back
,
her
pale
face
looking
upward
,
her
hands
wildly
clasped
and
held
out
,
and
her
hair
streaming
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Has
there
ever
been
a
single
minute
,
waking
or
sleeping
,
when
it
has
n't
been
before
me
,
just
as
it
used
to
be
in
the
lost
days
when
I
turned
my
back
upon
it
for
ever
and
for
ever
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
home
,
home
!
<EOS>
Oh
dear
,
dear
uncle
,
if
you
ever
could
have
known
the
agony
your
love
would
cause
me
when
I
fell
away
from
good
,
you
never
would
have
shown
it
to
me
<EOS>
so
constant
,
much
as
you
felt
it
;
but
would
have
been
angry
to
me
,
at
least
once
in
my
life
,
that
I
might
have
had
some
comfort
!
<EOS>
I
have
none
,
none
,
no
comfort
upon
earth
,
for
all
of
them
were
always
fond
of
me
!
"
<EOS>
She
dropped
on
her
face
,
before
the
imperious
figure
in
the
chair
,
with
an
imploring
effort
to
clasp
the
skirt
of
her
dress
.
   
<EOS>
Rosa
Dartle
sat
looking
down
upon
her
,
as
inflexible
as
a
figure
of
brass
.
 
<EOS>
Her
lips
were
tightly
compressed
,
as
if
she
knew
that
she
must
keep
a
strong
constraint
upon
herself
---
I
write
what
I
sincerely
believe
---
or
she
would
be
tempted
to
strike
the
beautiful
form
with
her
foot
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
her
,
distinctly
,
and
the
whole
power
of
her
face
and
character
seemed
forced
into
that
expression
.
 
<EOS>
---
Would
he
never
come
?
   
<EOS>
"
The
miserable
vanity
of
these
earth
-
worms
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
when
she
had
so
far
controlled
the
angry
heavings
of
her
breast
,
that
she
could
trust
herself
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
YOUR
home
!
<EOS>
Do
you
imagine
that
I
bestow
a
thought
on
it
,
or
suppose
you
could
do
any
harm
to
that
low
place
,
which
money
would
not
pay
for
,
and
handsomely
?
 
<EOS>
YOUR
home
!
<EOS>
You
were
a
part
of
the
trade
of
your
home
,
and
were
bought
and
sold
like
any
other
vendible
thing
your
people
dealt
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
not
that
!
"
cried
Emily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Say
anything
of
me
;
but
do
n't
visit
my
disgrace
and
shame
,
more
than
I
have
done
,
on
folks
who
are
as
honourable
as
you
!
<EOS>
Have
some
respect
for
them
,
as
you
are
a
lady
,
if
you
have
no
mercy
for
me

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
speak
,
"
she
said
,
not
deigning
to
take
any
heed
of
this
appeal
,
and
drawing
away
her
dress
from
the
contamination
of
Emily
's
touch
,
"
I
speak
of
HIS
home
---
where
I
live
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
"
she
said
,
stretching
out
her
hand
with
her
contemptuous
laugh
,
and
looking
down
upon
the
prostrate
girl
,
"
is
a
worthy
cause
of
division
between
lady
-
mother
and
gentleman
-
son
;
of
grief
in
a
house
where
she
would
n't
have
been
admitted
as
a
kitchen
-
girl
;
of
anger
,
and
repining
,
and
reproach
.
<EOS>
This
piece
of
pollution
,
picked
up
from
the
water
-
side
,
to
be
made
much
of
for
an
hour
,
and
then
tossed
back
to
her
original
place
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
no
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Emily
,
clasping
her
hands
together
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
he
first
came
into
my
way
---
that
the
day
had
never
dawned
upon
me
,
and
he
had
met
me
being
carried
to
my
grave
!
<EOS>
---
I
had
been
brought
up
as
virtuous
as
you
or
any
lady
,
and
was
going
to
be
the
wife
of
as
good
a
man
as
you
or
any
lady
in
the
world
can
ever
marry
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
live
in
his
home
and
know
him
,
you
know
,
perhaps
,
what
his
power
with
a
weak
,
vain
girl
might
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
defend
myself
,
but
<EOS>
I
know
well
,
and
he
knows
well
,
or
he
will
know
when
he
comes
to
die
,
and
his
mind
is
troubled
with
it
,
that
he
used
all
his
power
to
deceive
me
,
and
that
I
believed
him
,
trusted
him
,
and
loved
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
Dartle
sprang
up
from
her
seat
;
recoiled
;
and
in
recoiling
struck
at
her
,
with
a
face
of
such
malignity
,
so
darkened
and
disfigured
by
passion
,
that
I
had
almost
thrown
myself
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
blow
,
which
had
no
aim
,
fell
upon
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
now
stood
panting
,
looking
at
her
with
the
utmost
detestation
that
she
was
capable
of
expressing
,
and
trembling
from
head
to
foot
with
rage
and
scorn
<EOS>
,
I
thought
I
had
never
seen
such
a
sight
,
and
never
could
see
such
another
.
   
<EOS>
"
YOU
love
him
?
 
<EOS>
You
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
with
her
clenched
hand
,
quivering
as
if
it
only
wanted
a
weapon
to
stab
the
object
of
her
wrath
.
   
<EOS>
Emily
had
shrunk
out
of
my
view
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
tell
that
to
ME
,
"
she
added
,
"
with
your
shameful
lips
?
 
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
they
whip
these
creatures
?
 
<EOS>
If
I
could
order
it
to
be
done
,
I
would
have
this
girl
whipped
to
death
.
"
   
<EOS>
And
so
she
would
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
trusted
her
with
the
rack
itself
,
while
that
furious
look
lasted
.
<EOS>
She
slowly
,
very
slowly
,
broke
into
a
laugh
,
and
pointed
at
Emily
with
her
hand
,
as
if
she
were
a
sight
of
shame
for
gods
and
men
.
   
<EOS>
"
SHE
love
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
THAT
carrion
!
<EOS>
And
he
ever
cared
for
her
,
she
'd
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
The
liars
that
these
traders
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
mockery
was
worse
than
her
undisguised
rage
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
two
,
I
would
have
much
preferred
to
be
the
object
of
the
latter
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
when
she
suffered
it
to
break
loose
,
it
was
only
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
chained
it
up
again
,
and
however
it
might
tear
her
within
,
she
subdued
it
to
herself
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
came
here
,
you
pure
fountain
of
love
,
"
she
said
,
"
to
see
---
as
I
began
by
telling
you
---
what
such
a
thing
as
you
was
like
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
curious
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
Also
to
tell
you
,
that
you
had
best
seek
that
home
of
yours
,
with
all
speed
,
and
hide
your
head
among
those
excellent
people
who
are
expecting
you
,
and
whom
your
money
will
console
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
's
all
gone
,
you
can
believe
,
and
trust
,
and
love
again
,
you
know
!
<EOS>
I
thought
you
a
broken
toy
that
had
lasted
its
time
;
a
worthless
spangle
that
was
tarnished
,
and
thrown
away
.
<EOS>
But
,
finding
you
true
gold
,
a
very
lady
,
and
an
ill
-
used
innocent
,
with
a
fresh
heart
full
of
love
and
trustfulness
---
which
you
look
like
,
and
is
quite
consistent
with
your
story
!
<EOS>
---
I
have
something
more
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
Attend
to
it
;
for
what
I
say
I
'll
do
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
me
,
you
fairy
spirit
?
 
<EOS>
What
I
say
,
I
mean
to
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
rage
got
the
better
of
her
again
,
for
a
moment
;
but
it
passed
over
her
face
like
a
spasm
,
and
left
her
smiling
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hide
yourself
,
"
she
pursued
,
"
if
not
at
home
,
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
Let
it
be
somewhere
beyond
reach
;
in
some
obscure
life
---
or
,
better
still
,
in
some
obscure
death
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
,
if
your
loving
heart
will
not
break
,
you
have
found
no
way
of
helping
it
to
be
still
!
<EOS>
I
have
heard
of
such
means
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
they
may
be
easily
found
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
low
crying
,
on
the
part
of
Emily
,
interrupted
her
here
.
 
<EOS>
She
stopped
,
and
listened
to
it
as
if
it
were
music
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
of
a
strange
nature
,
perhaps
,
"
Rosa
Dartle
went
on
;
"
but
I
ca
n't
breathe
freely
in
the
air
you
breathe
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
it
sickly
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
I
will
have
it
cleared
;
I
will
have
it
purified
of
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
live
here
tomorrow
,
I
'll
have
your
story
and
your
character
proclaimed
on
the
common
stair
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
decent
women
in
the
house
,
I
am
told
;
and
it
is
a
pity
such
a
light
as
you
should
be
among
them
,
and
concealed
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
leaving
here
,
you
seek
any
refuge
in
this
town
in
any
character
but
your
true
one
(
which
you
are
welcome
to
bear

the

service
shall
be
done
you

if
I
hear
of
your
retreat
.
 
<EOS>
Being
assisted
by
a
gentleman
who
not
long
ago
aspired
to
the
favour
of
your
hand
,
I
am
sanguine
as
to
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
Would
he
never
,
never
come
?
 
<EOS>
How
long
was
I
to
bear
this
?
 
<EOS>
How
long
could
I
bear
it
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
me
,
<EOS>
oh
me
!
"
exclaimed
the
wretched
Emily
,
in
a
tone
that
might
have
touched
the
hardest
heart
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
thought
;
but
there
was
no
relenting
in
Rosa
Dartle
's
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
,
what
,
shall
I
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
?
<EOS>
"
returned
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Live
happy
in
your
own
reflections
!
<EOS>
Consecrate
your
existence
to
the
recollection
of
James
Steerforth
's
tenderness
---
he
would
have
made
you
his
serving
-
man
's
wife
,
would
he
not
?
 
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
or
to
feeling
grateful
to
the
upright
and
deserving
creature
who
would
have
taken
you
as
his
gift
.
 
<EOS>
Or
,
if
those
proud
remembrances
,
and
the
consciousness
of
your
own
virtues
,
and
the
honourable
position
to
which
they
have
raised
you
in
the
eyes
of
everything
that
wears
the
human
shape
,
will
not
sustain
you
,
marry
that
good
man
,
and
be
happy
in
his
condescension
.
 
<EOS>
If
this
will
not
do
either
,
die
!
<EOS>
There
are
doorways
and
dust
-
heaps
for
such
deaths
,
and
such
despair
---
find
one
,
and
take
your
flight
to
Heaven
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
heard
a
distant
foot
upon
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
it
<EOS>
,
I
was
certain
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
,
thank
God
!
   
<EOS>
She
moved
slowly
from
before
the
door
when
she
said
this
,
and
passed
out
of
my
sight
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
mark
!
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
slowly
and
sternly
,
opening
the
other
door
to
go
away
,
"
I
am
resolved
,
for
reasons
that
I
have
and
hatreds
that
I
entertain
,
to
cast
you
out
,
unless
you
withdraw
from
my
reach
altogether
,
or
drop
your
pretty
mask
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
what
I
had
to
say
;
and
what
I
say
,
I
mean
to
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
foot
upon
the
stairs
came
nearer
---
nearer
---
passed
her
as
she
went
down
---
rushed
into
the
room
!
   
<EOS>
"
Uncle
!
"
   
<EOS>
A
fearful
cry
followed
the
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
paused
a
moment
,
and
looking
in
,
saw
him
supporting
her
insensible
figure
in
his
arms
.
 
<EOS>
He
gazed
for
a
few
seconds
in
the
face
;
then
stooped
to
kiss
it
---
<EOS>
oh
,
how
tenderly
!
<EOS>
---
and
drew
a
handkerchief
before
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
low
tremulous
voice
,
when
it
was
covered
<EOS>
,
"
I
thank
my
Heav'nly
Father
as
my
dream
's
come
true
!
<EOS>
I
thank
Him
hearty
for
having
guided
of
me
,
in
His
own
ways
,
to
my
darling
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
those
words
he
took
her
up
in
his
arms
;
and
,
with
the
veiled
face
lying
on
his
bosom
,
and
addressed
towards
his
own

carried
her
,
motionless
and
unconscious
,
down
the
stairs

Chapter
51
.
<EOS>
The
beginning
of
a
longer
journey
 
<EOS>
It
was
yet
early
in
the
morning
of
the
following
day
,
when
,
as
I
was
walking
in
my
garden
with
my
aunt
(
who
took
little
other
exercise
now
,
being
so
much
in
attendance
on
my
dear
Dora
)
,
I
was
told
that
Mr
Peggotty
desired
to
speak
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
into
the
garden
to
meet
me
half
-
way
,
on
my
going
towards
the
gate
;
and
bared
his
head
,
as
it
was
always
his
custom
to
do
when
he
saw
my
aunt
,
for
whom
he
had
a
high
respect
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
been
telling
her
all
that
had
happened
overnight
.
 
<EOS>
Without
saying
a
word
,
she
walked
up
with
a
cordial
face
,
shook
hands
with
him
,
and
patted
him
on
the
arm
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
expressively
done
,
that
she
had
no
need
to
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
understood
her
quite
as
well
as
if
she
had
said
a
thousand
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
in
now
,
Trot
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
and
look
after
Little
Blossom
,
who
will
be
getting
up
presently
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
along
of
my
being
heer
,
ma'am
,
I
hope
?
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
<EOS>
"
Unless
my
wits
is
gone
a
bahd
's
neezing
"
---
by
which
Mr
Peggotty
meant
to
say
,
bird's
-
nesting
---
"
this
morning
,
'
tis
along
of
me
as
you
're
a
-
going
to
quit
us
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
something
to
say
,
my
good
friend
,
"
returned
my
aunt
,
"
and
will
do
better
without
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
your
leave
,
ma'am
,
"
returned
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
I
should
take
it
kind
,
pervising
you
doen't
<EOS>
mind
<EOS>
my
clicketten
,
if
you
'd
bide
heer
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
?
"
said
my
aunt
,
with
short
good
-
nature
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
am
sure
I
will
!
"
   
<EOS>
So
,
she
drew
her
arm
through
Mr
Peggotty
's
,
and
walked
with
him
to
a
leafy
little
summer
-
house
there
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
,
where
she
sat
down
on
a
bench
,
and
I
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
seat
for
Mr
Peggotty
too
,
but
he
preferred
to
stand
,
leaning
his
hand
on
the
small
rustic
table
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
stood
,
looking
at
his
cap
for
a
little
while
before
beginning
to
speak
,
I
could
not
help
observing
what
power
and
force
of
character
his
sinewy
hand
expressed
,
and
what
a
good
and
trusty
companion
it
was
to
his
honest
brow
and
iron
-
grey
hair
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
took
my
dear
child
away
last
night
,
"
Mr
Peggotty
began
,
as
he
raised
his
eyes
to
ours
,
"
to
my
lodging
,
<EOS>
wheer
<EOS>
I
have
a
long
time
been
expecting
of
her
and
preparing
fur
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
<EOS>
hours
afore
she
knowed
me
right
;
and
when
she
did
,
she
kneeled
down
at
my
feet
,
and
kiender
said
to
me
,
as
if
it
was
her
prayers
,
how
it
all
come
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
believe
me
,
when
I
heerd
her
voice
,
as
I
had
heerd
at
home
<EOS>
so
playful
---
and
see
her
humbled
,
as
it
might
be
in
the
dust
our
Saviour
wrote
in
with
his
blessed
hand
<EOS>
---
I
felt
a
wownd
go
to
my
'
art
,
in
the
midst
of
all
its
thankfulness
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
drew
his
sleeve
across
his
face
,
without
any
pretence
of
concealing
why
;
and
then
cleared
his
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
warn't
<EOS>
for
long
as
I
felt
that
;
for
she
was
found
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
on'y
to
think
as
she
was
found
,
and
it
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
doen't
know
why
I
do
so
much
as
mention
of
it
now
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
have
it
in
my
mind
a
minute
ago
,
to
say
a
word
about
myself
;
but
it
come
up
so
nat'ral
,
that
I
yielded
to
it
<EOS>
afore
<EOS>
I
was
aweer
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
self
-
denying
soul
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
and
will
have
your
reward
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
,
with
the
shadows
of
the
leaves
playing
athwart
his
face
,
made
a
surprised
inclination
of
the
head
towards
my
aunt
,
as
an
acknowledgement
of
her
good
opinion
;
then
took
up
the
thread
he
had
relinquished
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
my
Em'ly
took
flight
,
"
he
said
,
in
stern
wrath
for
the
moment
,
"
from
the
house
wheer
she
was
made
a
prisoner
by
that
theer
spotted
snake
as
Mas'r
Davy
see
,
---
and
his
story
's
trew
,
and
may
GOD
confound
him
!
<EOS>
---
she
took
flight
in
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
dark
night
,
with
a
many
stars
a
-
shining
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
wild
.
 
<EOS>
She
ran
along
the
sea
beach
,
believing
the
old
boat
was
theer
;
and
calling
out
to
us
to
turn
away
our
faces
,
for
she
was
a
-
coming
by
.
 
<EOS>
She
heerd
herself
a
-
crying
out
,
like
as
if
it
was
another
person
;
and
cut
herself
on
them
sharp
-
pinted
stones
and
rocks
,
and
felt
it
no
more
than
if
she
had
been
rock
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Ever
so
fur
she
run
,
and
there
was
fire
afore
her
eyes
,
and
roarings
in
her
ears
.
 
<EOS>
Of
a
sudden
---
or
<EOS>
so
she
thowt
,
<EOS>
you
unnerstand
---
<EOS>
the
day
broke
,
wet
and
windy
,
and
she
was
lying
b'low
a
heap
of
stone
upon
the
shore
,
and
a
woman
was
a
-
speaking
to
her
,
saying
,
in
the
language
of
that
country
,
what
was
it
as
had
gone
so
much
amiss
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
saw
everything
he
related
.
 
<EOS>
It
passed
before
him
,
as
he
spoke
,
so
vividly
,
that
,
in
the
intensity
of
his
earnestness
,
he
presented
what
he
described
to
me
,
with
greater
distinctness
than
I
can
express
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
believe
,
writing
now
long
afterwards
,
but
that
I
was
actually
present
in
these
scenes
;
they
are
impressed
upon
me
with
such
an
astonishing
air
of
fidelity
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
Em'ly
's
eyes
---
which
was
heavy
---
see
this
woman
better
,
"
Mr
Peggotty
went
on
,
"
<EOS>
she
know'd
<EOS>
as
she
was
one
of
them
as
she
had
often
talked
to
on
the
beach
.
 
<EOS>
Fur
,
though
she
had
run
(
as
I
have
said
)
ever
so
fur
in
the
night
,
she
had
oftentimes
wandered
long
ways
,
partly
afoot
,
partly
in
boats
and
carriages
,
and
know'd
all
that
country
,
'
long
the
coast
,
miles
and
miles
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
n't
no
children
of
her
own
,
<EOS>
this
woman
,
being
a
young
wife
;
but
she
was
a
-
looking
to
have
one
afore
long
.
 
<EOS>
And
may
my
prayers
go
up
to
Heaven
<EOS>
that
'
twill
be
a
happiness
to
her
,
and
a
comfort
,
and
a
honour
,
all
her
life
!
<EOS>
May
it
love
her
and
be
dootiful
to
her
,
in
her
old
age
;
helpful
of
her
at
the
last
;
a
Angel
to
her
heer
,
and
heerafter
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Amen
!
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
had
been
summat
timorous
and
down
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
and
had
sat
,
at
first
,
a
little
way
off
,
at
her
spinning
,
or
such
work
as
it
was
,
when
Em'ly
talked
to
the
children
.
 
<EOS>
But
Em'ly
had
took
notice
of
her
,
and
had
gone
and
spoke
to
her
;
and
as
the
young
woman
was
partial
to
the
children
herself
,
they
had
soon
made
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Sermuchser
,
that
when
Em'ly
went
that
way
,
she
always
giv
Em'ly
flowers
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
her
as
now
asked
what
it
was
that
had
gone
so
much
amiss
.
 
<EOS>
Em'ly
told
her
,
and
she
---
took
her
home
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
her
home
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
covering
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
more
affected
by
this
act
of
kindness
,
than
I
had
ever
seen
him
affected
by
anything
since
the
night
<EOS>
she
went
away
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
and
<EOS>
I
did
not
attempt
to
disturb
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
little
cottage
,
you
may
suppose
,
"
he
said
,
presently
,
"
but
she
found
space
for
Em'ly
in
it
,
---
her
husband
was
away
at
sea
,
---
and
she
kep
it
secret
,
and
prevailed
upon
such
neighbours
as
she
had
<EOS>
(
they
was
not
many
near
)
to
keep
it
secret
too
.
 
<EOS>
Em'ly
was
took
bad
with
fever
,
and
,
what
is
very
strange
to
me
is
,
---
maybe
'
tis
not
so
strange
to
scholars
,
---
<EOS>
the
language
of
that
country
went
out
of
her
head
,
and
she
could
only
speak
her
own
,
that
no
one
unnerstood
.
 
<EOS>
She
recollects
,
as
if
she
had
dreamed
it
,
that
she
lay
there
always
a
-
talking
her
own
tongue
,
always
believing
<EOS>
as
the
old
boat
was
round
the
next
pint
in
the
bay
,
and
begging
and
imploring
of
'em
to
send
theer
and
tell
how
she
was
dying
,
and
bring
back
a
message
of
forgiveness
,
if
it
was
on'y
a
wured
.
 
<EOS>
A'most
the
whole
time
,
she
thowt
,
---
now
,
that
him
as
I
made
mention
on
just
now
was
lurking
for
her
unnerneath
the
winder
;
now
that
him
as
had
brought
her
to
this
was
in
the
room
,
---
and
cried
to
the
good
young
woman
not
to
give
her
up
,
and
know'd
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
she
could
n't
unnerstand
,
and
dreaded
that
she
must
be
took
away
.
 
<EOS>
Likewise
the
fire
was
afore
her
eyes
,
and
the
roarings
in
her
ears
;
and
theer
was
no
today
,
nor
yesterday
,
nor
yet
tomorrow
;
but
everything
in
her
life
as
ever
had
been
,
or
as
ever
could
be
,
and
everything
as
never
had
been
,
and
as
never
could
be
,
was
a
crowding
on
her
all
at
once
,
and
nothing
clear
nor
welcome
,
and
yet
she
sang
and
laughed
about
it
!
<EOS>
How
long
this
lasted
,
I
doen't
know
;
but
then
theer
come
a
sleep
;
and
in
that
sleep
,
from
being
a
many
times
stronger
than
her
own
self
,
she
fell
into
the
weakness
of
the
littlest
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
he
stopped
,
as
if
for
relief
from
the
terrors
of
his
own
description
.
 
<EOS>
After
being
silent
for
a
few
moments
,
he
pursued
his
story
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
pleasant
arternoon
when
she
awoke
;
and
so
quiet
,
that
there
warn't
<EOS>
a
sound
but
the
rippling
of
that
blue
sea
without
a
tide
,
upon
the
shore
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
her
belief
,
at
first
,
that
she
was
at
home
upon
a
Sunday
morning
;
but
the
vine
leaves
as
she
see
at
the
winder
,
and
the
hills
beyond
,
warn't
home
,
and
contradicted
of
her
.
<EOS>
Then
,
come
in
her
friend
to
watch
alongside
of
her
bed
;
and
then
she
know'd
<EOS>
as
the
old
boat
warn't
<EOS>
round
that
next
pint
in
the
bay
no
more
,
but
was
fur
off
;
and
know'd
where
she
was
,
and
why
;
and
broke
out
a
-
crying
on
that
good
young
woman
's
bosom
,
wheer
<EOS>
I
hope
her
baby
is
a
-
lying
now
,
a
-
cheering
of
her
with
its
pretty
eyes
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
could
not
speak
of
this
good
friend
of
Emily
's
without
a
flow
of
tears
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
to
try
.
 
<EOS>
He
broke
down
again
,
endeavouring
to
bless
her
!
   
<EOS>
"
That
done
<EOS>
my
Em'ly
good
<EOS>
,
"
he
resumed
,
after
such
emotion
as
I
could
not
behold
without
sharing
in
;
and
as
to
my
aunt
,
she
wept
with
all
her
heart
;
"
that
done
Em'ly
good
,
and
she
begun
to
mend
.
<EOS>
But
,
the
language
of
that
country
was
quite
gone
from
her
,
and
she
was
forced
to
make
signs
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
went
on
,
getting
better
from
day
to
day
,
slow
,
but
sure
,
and
trying
to
learn
the
names
of
common
things
---
names
as
she
seemed
never
to
have
heerd
in
all
her
life
---
<EOS>
till
one
evening
come
,
when
she
was
a
-
setting
at
her
window
,
looking
at
a
little
girl
at
play
upon
the
beach
.
 
<EOS>
And
of
a
sudden
this
child
held
out
her
hand
,
and
said
,
what
would
be
in
English
,
"
Fisherman
's
daughter
,
here
's
a
shell
!
"
<EOS>
---
for
you
are
to
unnerstand
that
they
used
at
first
to
call
her
"
Pretty
lady
"
,
as
the
general
way
in
that
country
is
,
and
that
she
had
taught
'em
to
call
her
"
Fisherman
's
daughter
"
instead
.
 
<EOS>
The
child
says
of
a
sudden
,
"
Fisherman
's
daughter
,
here
's
a
shell
!
"
<EOS>
Then
Em'ly
unnerstands
her
;
and
she
answers
,
bursting
out
a
-
crying
;
and
it
all
comes
back
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
Em'ly
got
strong
again
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
after
another
short
interval
of
silence
,
"
she
cast
about
to
leave
that
good
young
creetur
,
and
get
to
her
own
country
.
 
<EOS>
The
husband
was
come
home
,
then
;
and
the
two
together
put
her
aboard
a
small
trader
bound
to
Leghorn
,
and
from
that
to
France
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
a
little
money
,
but
it
was
less
than
little
as
they
would
take
for
all
they
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a'most
glad
on
it
,
though
they
was
so
poor
!
<EOS>
What
they
done
,
is
laid
up
wheer
neither
moth
or
rust
doth
corrupt
,
and
wheer
thieves
do
not
break
through
nor
steal
.
 
<EOS>
Mas'r
Davy
,
it
'll
outlast
all
the
treasure
in
the
wureld
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Em'ly
got
to
France
,
and
took
service
to
wait
on
travelling
ladies
at
a
inn
in
the
port
.
 
<EOS>
Theer
,
theer
come

one
day

that

<EOS>

Let
him
never

me

<EOS>
I
<EOS>
doen't
know
what
hurt
I
might
do
him
!
<EOS>
---
Soon
as
she
see
him
,
without
him
seeing
her
,
all
her
fear
and
wildness
returned
upon
her
,
and
she
fled
afore
the
very
breath
<EOS>
he
<EOS>
draw'd
.
 
<EOS>
She
come
to
England
,
and
was
set
ashore
at
Dover
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
doen't
know
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
for
sure
,
when
her
'
art
begun
to
fail
her
;
but
all
the
way
to
England
she
had
thowt
to
come
to
her
dear
home
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
as
she
got
to
England
<EOS>
she
turned
her
face
<EOS>
tow'rds
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
fear
of
not
being
forgiv
,
fear
of
being
pinted
at
,
fear
of
some
of
us
being
dead
along
of
her
,
fear
of
many
things
,
turned
her
from
it
,
kiender
by
force
,
upon
the
road
:
"
Uncle
,
uncle
,
"
she
says
to
me
,
"
the
fear
of
not
being
worthy
to
do
what
my
torn
and
bleeding
<EOS>
breast
so
longed
to
do
,
was
the
most
fright'ning
fear
of
all
!
<EOS>
I
turned
back
,
when
my
'
art
was
full
of
prayers
that
I
might
crawl
to
the
old
door
-
step
,
in
the
night
,
kiss
it
,
lay
my
wicked
face
upon
it
,
and
theer
be
found
dead
in
the
morning

"
<EOS>
"
   
"
She
come
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
dropping
his
voice
to
an
awe
-
stricken
whisper
,
"
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
She
---
as
had
never
seen
it
in
her
life
---
alone
---
without
a
penny
---
<EOS>
young
---
so
pretty
---
come
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
A'most
the
moment
as
she
lighted
heer
,
all
so
desolate
<EOS>
,
she
found
(
as
she
believed
)
<EOS>
a
friend
;
a
decent
woman
as
spoke
to
her
about
the
needle
-
work
as
she
had
been
brought
up
to
do
,
about
finding
plenty
of
it
fur
her
,
about
a
lodging
fur
the
night
,
and
making
secret
inquiration
concerning

tomorrow

<EOS>
When
my

,
"
he
said
aloud
,
and
with
an
energy
of
gratitude
that
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
,
"
stood
upon
the
brink
of
more
than
I
can
say

think
on

<EOS>
Martha

trew
to
her

saved
her

"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
repress
a
cry
of
joy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mas'r
Davy
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
gripping
my
hand
in
that
strong
hand
of
his
,
"
it
was
you
as
first
made
mention
of
her
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
thankee
,
sir

<EOS>
She
was
arnest
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
know'd
of
her
bitter
knowledge
wheer
to
watch
and
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
done
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
Lord
was
above
all
!
<EOS>
She
come
,
white
and
hurried
,
upon
Em'ly
in
her
sleep

<EOS>
She
says
to
her
,
"
Rise
up
from
worse
than
death
,
and
come
with
me
!
"
<EOS>
Them
belonging
to
the
house
would
have
stopped
her
,
but
they
might
as
soon
have
stopped
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stand
away
from

she
says
,
"
I
am
a
ghost

calls
her

<EOS>
She
told
Em'ly
<EOS>
she
had
seen
me
,
and
know'd
I
loved
her
,
and
forgive
her

<EOS>
She
wrapped
her
,
hasty
,
in
her
clothes
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
her
,
faint
and
trembling
,
on
her
arm

<EOS>
She
heeded
no
more
what
they
said
,
than
if
she
had
had
no
ears
.
 
<EOS>
She
walked
among
'em
with
my
child
,
minding
only
her
;
and
brought
her
safe
out
,
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
from
that
black
pit
of
ruin
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
attended
on
Em'ly
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
who
had
released
my
hand
,
and
put
his
own
hand
on
his
heaving
chest
;
"
she
attended
to
my
Em'ly
,
lying
wearied
out
,
and
wandering
betwixt
whiles
,
till
late
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
went
in
search
of
me
;
then
in
search
of
you
,
Mas'r
Davy
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
n't
tell
Em'ly
what
she
come
out
fur
,
lest
her
'
art
should
fail
,
and
she
should
think
of
hiding
of
herself

<EOS>
How
the
cruel
lady
know'd
of
her
being
theer

I
ca

<EOS>
Whether
him

I
have
spoke
so
much
of

chanced
to
see
'em
going
theer
,
or
whether
(
which
is
most
like
,
to
my
thinking
)
he
had
heerd
it
from
the
woman
,
I
doen't
greatly
ask
myself
.
 
<EOS>
My
niece
is
found
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
night
long
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
we
have
been
together
,
Em'ly
and
me

<EOS>
'
Tis
little
(
considering
the
time
)
as
she
has
said
,
in
wureds
,
through

broken

hearted
tears
;
'
tis
less
as
I
have
seen
of
her
dear
face
,
as
grow'd
into
a
woman

at
my
hearth
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
all
night
long
,
her
arms
has
been
about
my

her
head
has
laid
heer

we
knows
full
well

as
we
can
put
our
trust
in
one
another
,
ever
more

"
   
<EOS>
He
ceased
to
speak
,
and
his
hand
upon
the
table
rested
there
in
perfect
repose
,
with
a
resolution
in
it
that
might
have
conquered
lions
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
gleam
of
light
upon
me
,
Trot
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
drying
her
eyes
,
"
when
I
formed
the
resolution
of
being
godmother
to
your
sister
Betsey
Trotwood
,
who
disappointed
me
;
but
,
next
to
that
,
hardly
anything
would
have
given
me
greater
pleasure
,
than
to
be
godmother
to
that
good
young
creature

baby

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
nodded
his
understanding
of
my
aunt
's
feelings
,
but
could
not
trust
himself
with
any
verbal
reference
to
the
subject
of
her
commendation
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
remained
silent
,
and
occupied
with
our
own
reflections
(
my
aunt
drying
her
eyes
,
and
now
sobbing
convulsively
,
and
now
laughing
and
calling
herself
a
fool
)
;
until
I
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
quite
made
up
your
mind
,
"
said
I
to
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
as
to

<EOS>
I
need
scarcely
ask
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite

Mas'r

he
returned
;

and
told
Em'ly

<EOS>

I.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes

said
Mr

,
with
a
hopeful

<EOS>
"
No

<EOS>
I
asked
him
if
he
yet
proposed
to
himself
any
time
for
going
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
down
at
the

early
this
morning

he
returned

to

ships

In

I

Mr

shaking

returned
Mr

with
a

gradually
cleared
as

went

I

Tan't

at

being

in

fur

<EOS>
So
that
's
what
I
'm
a
-
going
to
do
with
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
forgot
nobody
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
of
everybody
's
claims
and
strivings
,
but
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
"
Em'ly
,
"
he
continued
,
"
will
keep
along
with
me
---
poor
child

she
's
sore
in
need

peace

rest

<EOS>
---
<EOS>
until
such
time
as
we
goes
upon
our
voyage

<EOS>
She
'll
work
at
them
clothes
,
as
must
be
made
;
and
I
hope
her
troubles
will
begin
to
seem
longer
ago
than
they
was
<EOS>
,
wen
she
finds
herself
once
more
by
her
rough
but
loving
uncle
.
"
   
<EOS>
MY
aunt
nodded
confirmation
of
this
hope
,
and
imparted
great
satisfaction
to
Mr
Peggotty
.
   
<EOS>
"
Theer
's
one
thing
furder
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
said
he
,
putting
his
hand
in
his
breast
-
pocket
,
and
gravely
taking
out
the
little
paper
bundle
I
had
seen
before
,
which
he
unrolled
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
Theer
's
these
here
banknotes
---
fifty
pound
,
and
ten
.
 
<EOS>
To
them
I
wish
to
add
the
money
as
she
come
away
with
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
asked
her
about
that
<EOS>
(
but
not
saying
why
)
,
and
have
added
of
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
an't
a
scholar
.
 
<EOS>
Would
you
be
so
kind
as
see
how
'
tis
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
handed
me
,
apologetically
for
his
scholarship
,
a
piece
of
paper
,
and
observed
me
while
I
looked
it
over
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
right
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thankee
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
taking
it
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
money
,
if
you
doen't
<EOS>
see
objections
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
I
shall
put
up
jest
afore
<EOS>
I
go
,
in
a
cover
directed
to
him
;
and
put
that
up
in
another
,
directed
to
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
tell
her
,
in
no
more
wureds
than
I
speak
to
you
,
what
it
's
the
price
on
;
and
that
I
'm
gone
,
and
past
receiving
of
it
back
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
told
him
that
I
thought
it
would
be
right
to
do
so
---
that
I
was
thoroughly
convinced
it
would
be
,
since
he
felt
it
to
be
right
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
said
that
theer
was
on'y
one
thing
furder
,
"
he
proceeded
with
a
grave
smile
,
when
he
had
made
up
his
little
bundle
again
,
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
;
"
but
theer
was
two
.
 
<EOS>
I
warn't
sure
in
my
mind
<EOS>
,
wen
I
come
out
this
morning
,
as
I
could
go
and
break
to
Ham
,
of
my
own
self
,
what
had
so
thankfully
happened
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
writ
a
letter
while
I
was
out
,
and
put
it
in
the
post
-
office
,
telling
of
'em
how
all
was
as
'
tis
;
and
that
I
should
come
down
tomorrow
to
unload
my
mind
of
what
little
needs
a
-
doing
of
down
theer
,
and
,
most
-
like
,
take
my
farewell
leave
of
Yarmouth
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
do
you
wish
me
to
go
with
you
?
"
<EOS>
said
I
,
seeing
that
he
left
something
unsaid
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
could
do
me
that
kind
favour
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
sight
on
you
would
cheer
'em
up
a
bit
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
little
Dora
being
in
good
spirits
,
and
very
desirous
that
I
should
go
---
as
I
found
on
talking
it
over
with
her
<EOS>
---
I
readily
pledged
myself
to
accompany
him
in
accordance
with
his
wish
.
 
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
consequently
,
we
were
on
the
Yarmouth
coach
,
and
again
travelling
over
the
old
ground
.
   
<EOS>
As
we
passed
along
the
familiar
street
at
night
---
Mr
Peggotty
,
in
despite
of
all
my
remonstrances
,
carrying
my
bag
---
I
glanced
into
Omer
and
Joram
's
shop
,
and
saw
my
old
friend
Mr
Omer
there
,
smoking
his
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
reluctant
to
be
present
,
when
Mr
Peggotty
first
met
his
sister
and
Ham
;
and
made
Mr
Omer
my
excuse
for
lingering
behind
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
is
Mr
Omer
,
after
this
long
time
?
"
said
I
,
going
in
.
   
<EOS>
He
fanned
away
the
smoke
of
his
pipe
,
that
he
might
get
a
better
view
of
me
,
and
soon
recognized
me
with
great
delight
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
get
up
,
sir
,
to
acknowledge
such
an
honour
as
this
visit
,
"
said
he
,
"
only
my
limbs
are
rather
out
of
sorts
,
and
I
am
wheeled
about
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
exception
of
my
limbs
and
my
breath
,
howsoever
,
I
am
as
hearty
as
a
man
can
be
,
I
'm
thankful
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
congratulated
him
on
his
contented
looks
and
his
good
spirits
,
and
saw
,
now
,
that
his
easy
-
chair
went
on
wheels
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
an
ingenious
thing
,
ai
n't
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
,
following
the
direction
of
my
glance
,
and
polishing
the
elbow
with
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
runs
as
light
as
a
feather
,
and
tracks
as
true
as
a
mail
-
coach
.
<EOS>
Bless
you
,
my
little
Minnie
---
my
grand
-
daughter
you
know
,
Minnie
's
child
---
puts
her
little
strength
against
the
back
,
gives
it
a
shove
,
and
away
we
go
,
as
clever
and
merry
as
ever
<EOS>
you
see
anything
!
<EOS>
And
I
tell
you
what
---
it
's
a
most
uncommon
chair
to
smoke
a
pipe
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
never
saw
such
a
good
old
fellow
to
make
the
best
of
a
thing
,
and
find
out
the
enjoyment
of
it
,
as
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
as
radiant
,
as
if
his
chair
,
his
asthma
,
and
the
failure
of
his
limbs
,
were
the
various
branches
of
a
great
invention
for
enhancing
the
luxury
of
a
pipe
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
more
of
the
world
,
I
can
assure
you
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
"
in
this
chair
,
than
ever
I
see
out
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
'd
be
surprised
at
the
number
of
people
that
looks
in
of
a
day
to
have
a
chat
.
 
<EOS>
You
really
would
!
<EOS>
There
's
twice
as
much
in
the
newspaper
,
since
I
've
taken
to
this
chair
,
as
there
used
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
general
reading
,
dear
me
,
what
a
lot
of
it
I
do
get
through
!
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
feel
so
strong
,
you
know
!
<EOS>
If
it
had
been
my
eyes
,
what
should
I
have
done
?
 
<EOS>
If
it
had
been
my
ears
,
what
should
I
have
done
?
 
<EOS>
Being
my
limbs
,
what
does
it
signify
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
my
limbs
only
made
my
breath
shorter
when
I
used
'em
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
if
I
want
to
go
out
into
the
street
or
down
to
the
sands
,
I
've
only
got
to
call
Dick
,
Joram
's
youngest
'
prentice
,
<EOS>
and
away
I
go
in
my
own
carriage
,
like
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
half
suffocated
himself
with
laughing
here
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
Mr
Omer
,
resuming
his
pipe
<EOS>
,
"
a
man
must
take
the
fat
with
the
lean
;
that
's
what
he
must
make
up
his
mind
to
,
in
this
life
.
 
<EOS>
Joram
does
a
fine
business
.
 
<EOS>
Ex
-
cellent
business
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
would
be
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
Joram
and
Minnie
are
like
Valentines
.
 
<EOS>
What
more
can
a
man
expect
?
 
<EOS>
What
's
his
limbs
to
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
supreme
contempt
for
his
own
limbs
,
as
he
sat
smoking
,
was
one
of
the
pleasantest
oddities
I
have
ever
encountered
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
since
I
've
took
to
general
reading
,
you
've
took
to
general
writing
,
eh
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
surveying
me
admiringly
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
lovely
work
that
was
of
yours
!
<EOS>
What
expressions
in
it
!
<EOS>
I
read
it
every
word
---
every
word
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
to
feeling
sleepy
!
<EOS>
Not
at
all
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
laughingly
expressed
my
satisfaction
,
but
I
must
confess
that
I
thought
this
association
of
ideas
significant
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
give
you
my
word
and
honour
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
"
that
when
I
lay
that
book
upon
the
table
,
and
look
at
it
outside
;
compact
in
three
separate
and
indiwidual
wollumes
---
one
,
two
,
three
;
I
am
as
proud
as
Punch
to
think
that
I
once
had
the
honour
of
being
connected
with
your
family
.
 
<EOS>
And
dear
me
<EOS>
,
it
's
a
long
time
ago
,
now
,
ai
n't
it
?
 
<EOS>
Over
at
Blunderstone
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
pretty
little
party
laid
along
with
the
other
party
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
quite
a
small
party
then
,
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
changed
the
subject
by
referring
to
Emily
.
 
<EOS>
After
assuring
him
that
I
did
not
forget
how
interested
he
had
always
been
in
her
,
and
how
kindly
he
had
always
treated
her
,
I
gave
him
a
general
account
of
her
restoration
to
her
uncle
by
the
aid
of
Martha
;
which
I
knew
would
please
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
listened
with
the
utmost
attention
,
and
said
,
feelingly
,
when
I
had
done
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
rejoiced
at
it
,
sir
!
<EOS>
It
's
the
best
news
I
have
heard
for
many
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
,
<EOS>
dear
!
<EOS>
And
what
's
going
to
be
undertook
for
that
unfortunate
young
woman
,
Martha
,
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
touch
a
point
that
my
thoughts
have
been
dwelling
on
since
yesterday
,
"
said
I
,
"
but
on
which
I
can
give
you
no
information
yet
,
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
has
not
alluded
to
it
,
and
I
have
a
delicacy
in
doing
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
he
has
not
forgotten
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
forgets
nothing
that
is
disinterested
and
good
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
you
know
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
taking
himself
up
,
where
he
had
left
off
,
"
whatever
is
done
,
I
should
wish
to
be
a
member
of
.
 
<EOS>
Put
me
down
for
anything
you
may
consider
right
,
and
let
me
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
could
think
the
girl
all
bad
,
and
I
am
glad
to
find
she
's
not
.
 
<EOS>
So
will
my
daughter
Minnie
be
.
 
<EOS>
Young
women
are
contradictory
creatures
in
some
things
---
her
mother
was
just
the
same
as
her
---
but
their
hearts
are
soft
and
kind
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
show
with
Minnie
,
about
Martha
.
 
<EOS>
Why
she
should
consider
it
necessary
to
make
any
show
,
I
do
n't
undertake
to
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
all
show
,
bless
you
.
<EOS>
She
'd
do
her
any
kindness
in
private
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
put
me
down
for
whatever
you
may
consider
right
,
will
you
be
so
good
?
 
and
drop
me
a
line
where
to
forward
it
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
me
!
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
"
when
a
man
is
drawing
on
to
a
time
of
life
,
where
the
two
ends
of
life
meet
;
when
he
finds
himself
,
however
hearty
he
is
,
being
wheeled
about
for
the
second
time
,
in
a
speeches
of
go
-
cart

he
should
be
over
-
rejoiced
to
do
a
kindness
if
he
can
.
 
<EOS>
He
wants
plenty
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
speak
of
myself
,
particular
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
"
because
,
sir
,
the
way
I
look
at
it
is
,
that
we
are
all
drawing
on
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
,
whatever
age
we
are
,
on
account
of
time
never
standing
still

So
let
us
always
do

be
over

<EOS>
To
be

"
   
<EOS>
He
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
,
and
put
it
on
a
ledge
in
the
back
of
his
chair
,
expressly
made
for
its
reception
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
Em'ly
's
cousin

him
that
she

said
Mr
Omer
,
rubbing
his
hands
feebly
,
"
as
fine
a
fellow
as
there

Yarmouth

He

come

I.

said
Mr

<EOS>
"
Tell

at
all
,
you
see
,
"
on
account
of
father
"
,
as
she
says
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
swore
tonight
,
that
if
she
did
n't
go
,
I
'd
go
to
bed
at
six
.
 
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
which
,
"
Mr
Omer
shook
himself
and
his
chair
with
laughter
at
the
success
of
his
device
,
"
she
and
Joram
's
at
a
ball
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
shook
hands
with
him
,
and
wished
him
good
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
Half
a
minute
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
was
to
go
without
seeing
my
little
elephant
,
you
'd
lose
the
best
of
sights
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
see
such
a
sight
!
<EOS>
Minnie
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
musical
little
voice
answered
,
from
somewhere
upstairs
,
"
I
am
coming
,
grandfather
!
"
<EOS>
and
a
pretty
little
girl
with
long
,
flaxen
,
curling
hair
,
soon
came
running
into
the
shop
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
my
little
elephant
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
fondling
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
"
Siamese
breed
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
little
elephant
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
little
elephant
set
the
door
of
the
parlour
open
,
enabling
me
to
see
that
,
in
these
latter
days
,
it
was
converted
into
a
bedroom
for
Mr
Omer
who
could
not
be
easily
conveyed
upstairs
;
and
then
hid
her
pretty
forehead
,
and
tumbled
her
long
hair
,
against
the
back
of
Mr
Omer
's
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
elephant
butts
,
you
know
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
said
Mr
Omer
,
winking
,
"
when
he
goes
at
a
object
.
 
<EOS>
Once
,
elephant
.
 
<EOS>
Twice
.
 
<EOS>
Three
times
!
"
   
<EOS>
At
this
signal
,
the
little
elephant
,
with
a
dexterity
that
was
next
to
marvellous
in
so
small
an
animal
,
whisked
the
chair
round
with
Mr
Omer
in
it
,
and
rattled
it
off
,
pell
-
mell
,
into
the
parlour
,
without
touching
the
door
-
post
:
<EOS>
Mr
Omer
indescribably
enjoying
the
performance
,
and
looking
back
at
me
on
the
road
as
if
it
were
the
triumphant
issue
of
his
life
's
exertions
.
   
<EOS>
After
a
stroll
about
the
town
I
went
to
Ham
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
had
now
removed
here
for
good
;
and
had
let
her
own
house
to
the
successor
of
Mr
Barkis
in
the
carrying
business
,
who
had
paid
her
very
well
for
the
good
-
will
,
cart
,
and
horse
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
the
very
same
slow
horse
that
Mr
Barkis
drove
was
still
at
work
.
   
<EOS>
I
found
them
in
the
neat
kitchen
,
accompanied
by
Mrs
Gummidge
,
who
had
been
fetched
from
the
old
boat
by
Mr
Peggotty
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
she
could
have
been
induced
to
desert
her
post
,
by
anyone
else
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
evidently
told
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
Both
Peggotty
and
Mrs
Gummidge
had
their
aprons
to
their
eyes
,
and
Ham
had
just
stepped
out
"
to
take
a
turn
on
the
beach
"
.
 
<EOS>
He
presently
came
home
,
very
glad
to
see
me
;
and
I
hope
they
were
all
the
better
for
my
being
there
.
 
<EOS>
We
spoke
,
with
some
approach
to
cheerfulness
,
of
Mr
Peggotty
's
growing
rich
in
a
new
country
,
and
of
the
wonders
he
would
describe
in
his
letters
.
 
<EOS>
We
said
nothing
of
Emily
by
name
,
but
distantly
referred
to
her
more
than
once
.
 
<EOS>
Ham
was
the
serenest
of
the
party
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
Peggotty
told
me
,
when
she
lighted
me
to
a
little
chamber
where
the
Crocodile
book
was
lying
ready
for
me
on
the
table
,
that
he
always
was
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
She
believed
(
she
told
me
,
crying
)
that
he
was
broken
-
hearted
;
though
he
was
as
full
of
courage
as
of
sweetness
,
and
worked
harder
and
better
than
any
boat
-
builder
in
any
yard
in
all
that
part
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
times
,
she
said
,
of
an
evening
,
when
he
talked
of
their
old
life
in
the
boat
-
house
;
and
then
he
mentioned
Emily
as
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
he
never
mentioned
her
as
a
woman
.
   
<EOS>
I
thought
I
had
read
in
his
face
that
he
would
like
to
speak
to
me
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
resolved
to
put
myself
in
his
way
next
evening
,
as
he
came
home
from
his
work
.
 
<EOS>
Having
settled
this
with
myself
,
I
fell
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
That
night
,
for
the
first
time
in
all
those
many
nights
,
the
candle
was
taken
out
of
the
window
,
Mr
Peggotty
swung
in
his
old
hammock
in
the
old
boat
,
and
the
wind
murmured
with
the
old
sound
round
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
All
next
day
,
he
was
occupied
in
disposing
of
his
fishing
-
boat
and
tackle
;
in
packing
up
,
and
sending
to
London
by
waggon
,
such
of
his
little
domestic
possessions
as
he
thought
would
be
useful
to
him
;
and
in
parting
with
the
rest
,
or
bestowing
them
on
Mrs
Gummidge
.
<EOS>
She
was
with
him
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
had
a
sorrowful
wish
to
see
the
old
place
once
more
,
before
it
was
locked
up
,
I
engaged
to
meet
them
there
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
so
arranged
it
,
as
that
I
should
meet
Ham
first
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
easy
to
come
in
his
way
,
as
I
knew
where
he
worked
.
 
<EOS>
I
met
him
at
a
retired
part
of
the
sands
,
which
I
knew
he
would
cross
,
and
turned
back
with
him
,
that
he
might
have
leisure
to
speak
to
me
if
he
really
wished
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
not
mistaken
the
expression
of
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
walked
but
a
little
way
together
,
when
he
said
,
without
looking
at
me
:
   
"
Mas'r
Davy
,
have
you
seen
her
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
for
a
moment
,
when
she
was
in
a
swoon
,
"
I
softly
answered
.
   
<EOS>
We
walked
a
little
farther
,
and
he
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Mas'r
Davy
,
shall
you
see
her
,
d'ye
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
too
painful
to
her
,
perhaps
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
thowt
of
that
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
'
twould
,
sir
,
so
'
twould
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
Ham
,
"
said
I
,
gently
,
"
if
there
is
anything
that
I
could
write
to
her
,
for
you
,
<EOS>
in
case
I
could
not
tell
it
;
if
there
is
anything
you
would
wish
to
make
known
to
her
through
me
;
I
should
consider
it
a
sacred
trust
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
on't
.
 
<EOS>
I
thankee
,
sir
,
most
kind
!
<EOS>
I
think
theer
is
something
I
could
wish
said
or
wrote
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
We
walked
a
little
farther
in
silence
,
and
then
he
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
'
Tan't
that
I
forgive
her
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tan't
that
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
more
as
I
beg
of
her
to
forgive
me
,
for
having
pressed
my
affections
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
Odd
times
,
I
think
that
if
I
had
n't
had
her
promise
fur
to
marry
me
,
sir
,
she
was
that
trustful
of
me
,
in
a
friendly
way
,
that
she
'd
have
told
me
what
was
struggling
in
her
mind
,
and
would
have
counselled
with
me
,
and
I
might
have
saved
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
pressed
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Theer
's
yet
a
something
else
,
"
he
returned
,
"
if
I
can
say
it
,
Mas'r
Davy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
walked
on
,
farther
than
we
had
walked
yet
,
before
he
spoke
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
crying
when
he
made
the
pauses
I
shall
express
by
lines
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
merely
collecting
himself
to
speak
very
plainly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
loved
her
---
and
I
love
the
mem'ry
of
her
---
too
deep
---
to
be
able
to
lead
her
to
believe
of
my
own
self
as
I
'm
a
happy
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
only
be
happy
---
by
forgetting
of
her
---
and
I
'm
afeerd
<EOS>
I
could
n't
hardly
bear
as
she
should
be
told
I
done
that
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
you
,
being
so
full
of
learning
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
could
think
of
anything
to
say
as
might
bring
her
to
believe
I
was
n't
greatly
hurt
:
still
loving
of
her
,
and
mourning
for
her
:
anything
as
might
bring
her
to
believe
as
I
was
not
tired
of
my
life
,
and
yet
was
hoping
fur
to
see
her
without
blame
,
wheer
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
<EOS>
the
weary
are
at
rest
---
<EOS>
anything
as
would
ease
her
sorrowful
mind
,
and
yet
not
make
her
think
as
I
could
ever
marry
,
or
as
'
twas
possible
that
anyone
could
ever
be
to
me
<EOS>
what
she
was
---
I
should
ask
of
you
to
say
that
---
with
my
prayers
for
her
---
that
was
so
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
pressed
his
manly
hand
again
,
and
told
him
I
would
charge
myself
to
do
this
as
well
as
I
could
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thankee
,
sir
,
"
he
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Twas
kind
of
you
to
meet
me
.
'
<EOS>
Twas
kind
of
you
to
bear
him
company
down
.
 
<EOS>
Mas'r
Davy
,
I
unnerstan
'
very
well
,
though
my
aunt
will
come
to
Lon'on
afore
they
sail
,
and
they
'll
unite
once
more
,
that
I
am
not
like
to
see
him
agen
.
 
<EOS>
I
fare
to
feel
sure
<EOS>
on't
.
 
<EOS>
We
doen't
say
so
,
but
<EOS>
so
'
twill
be
,
and
better
so
.
 
<EOS>
The
last
you
see
on
him
---
the
very
last
<EOS>
---
will
you
give
him
the
lovingest
duty
and
thanks
of
the
orphan
,
as
he
was
ever
more
than
a
father
to
?
"
   
<EOS>
This
I
also
promised
,
faithfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thankee
agen
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
heartily
shaking
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
wheer
<EOS>
you
're
a
-
going
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
a
slight
wave
of
his
hand
,
as
though
to
explain
to
me
that
he
could
not
enter
the
old
place
,
he
turned
away
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
looked
after
his
figure
,
crossing
the
waste
in
the
moonlight
,
I
saw
him
turn
his
face
towards
a
strip
of
silvery
light
upon
the
sea
,
and
pass
on
,
looking
at
it
,
until
he
was
a
shadow
in
the
distance
.
   
<EOS>
The
door
of
the
boat
-
house
stood
open
when
I
approached
;
and
,
on
entering
,
I
found
it
emptied
of
all
its
furniture
,
saving
one
of
the
old
lockers
,
on
which
Mrs
Gummidge
,
with
a
basket
on
her
knee
,
was
seated
,
looking
at
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
He
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
rough
chimney
-
piece
,
and
gazed
upon
a
few
expiring
embers
in
the
grate
;
but
he
raised
his
head
,
hopefully
,
on
my
coming
in
,
and
spoke
in
a
cheery
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
according
to
promise
,
to
bid
farewell
to
'
t
,
eh
,
Mas'r
Davy
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
taking
up
the
candle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bare
enough
,
now
,
an't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
you
have
made
good
use
of
the
time
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
we
have
not
been
idle
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Missis
Gummidge
has
worked
like
a
---
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
doen't
know
what
Missis
Gummidge
an't
worked
like
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
looking
at
her
,
at
a
loss
for
a
sufficiently
approving
simile
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gummidge
,
leaning
on
her
basket
,
made
no
observation
.
   
<EOS>
"
Theer
's
the
very
locker
that
you
used
to
sit
on
,
'
long
with
Em'ly
!
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
in
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
-
going
to
carry
it
away
with
me
,
last
of
all
.
 
<EOS>
And
heer
's
your
old
little
bedroom
,
see
,
<EOS>
Mas'r
Davy
!
<EOS>
A'most
as
bleak
tonight
,
as
'
art
could
wish
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
truth
,
the
wind
,
though
it
was
low
,
had
a
solemn
sound
,
and
crept
around
the
deserted
house
with
a
whispered
wailing
that
was
very
mournful
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
was
gone
,
down
to
the
little
mirror
with
the
oyster
-
shell
frame
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
of
myself
,
lying
here
,
when
that
first
great
change
was
being
wrought
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
of
the
blue
-
eyed
child
who
had
enchanted
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
of
Steerforth
:
and
a
foolish
,
fearful
fancy
came
upon
me
of
his
being
near
at
hand
,
and
liable
to
be
met
at
any
turn
.
   
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
like
to
be
long
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
<EOS>
afore
the
boat
finds
new
tenants
.
 
<EOS>
They
look
upon
'
t
,
down
beer
,
as
being
unfortunate
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
it
belong
to
anybody
in
the
neighbourhood
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
a
mast
-
maker
up
town
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
-
going
to
give
the
key
to
him
tonight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
looked
into
the
other
little
room
,
and
came
back
to
Mrs
Gummidge
,
sitting
on
the
locker
,
whom
Mr
Peggotty
,
putting
the
light
on
the
chimney
-
piece
,
requested
to
rise
,
that
he
might
carry
it
outside
the
door
before
extinguishing
the
candle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dan'l
,
"
said
Mrs
Gummidge
,
suddenly
deserting
her
basket
,
and
clinging
to

my

,
<EOS>
the
parting
words
I
speak
in
this
house
is
,
I
must
n't
be
left
behind
.
 
<EOS>
Doen't
ye
think
of
leaving
me
behind

Dan'l
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
doen't
ye
ever
do
it

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
,
taken
aback
,
looked
from
Mrs
Gummidge
to
me
,
and
from
me
to
Mrs
Gummidge
,
as
if
he
had
been
awakened
from
a
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
"
Doen't
ye
,
dearest
Dan'l
,
<EOS>
doen't
ye
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Gummidge
,
fervently
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
me
'
long
with
you
,
Dan'l
,
take
me
'
long
with
you
and
Em'ly

<EOS>
I
'll
be
your

constant
and

<EOS>
If
there

parts
where
you

going

I
'll
be
bound
to
you
for

and
happy

but
doen't

leave
me
behind
,
Dan'l
<EOS>
,
that
's
a
deary
dear

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
good
soul
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
you
<EOS>
doen't
know
what
a
long
voyage
,
and
what
a
hard
life
'
tis
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
,
Dan'l
!
<EOS>
I
can
guess
!
"
cried
Mrs
Gummidge
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
my
parting
words
under
this
roof
is
,
I
shall
go
into
the
house
and
die
,
if
I
am
not
took
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
dig
,
Dan'l
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
live
hard
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
be
loving
and
patient
now
---
more
than
you
think
,
Dan'l
<EOS>
,
if
you
'll
on'y
try
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
touch
the
'
lowance
,
not
if
I
was
dying
of
want
,
Dan'l
Peggotty
;
but
I
'll
go
with
you
and
Em'ly
,
if
you
'll
on'y
<EOS>
let
me
,
to
the
world

<EOS>
I

that
I
am
lone
and
lorn

but
,
deary
love
,
'
tan't
<EOS>
so
no
more

<EOS>
I
ai
n't
sat
here
,
so
long
,
a
-
watching
,
and
a
-
thinking
of
your
trials
,
without
some
good
being
done

<EOS>
Mas'r
Davy
,
speak
to
him
for
me
!
<EOS>
I
knows
his
ways
,
and
Em'ly

and
I
knows
their
sorrows

and
can
be
a
comfort
to

<EOS>
Dan'l
,
deary
Dan'l
,
let
me
go
'
long
with
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
And
Mrs
Gummidge
took
his
hand
,
and
kissed
it
with
a
homely
pathos
and
affection
,
in
a
homely
rapture
of
devotion
and
gratitude
,
that
he
well
deserved
.
   
<EOS>
We
brought
the
locker
out
,
extinguished
the
candle
,
fastened
the
door
on
the
outside
,
and
left
the
old
boat
close
shut
up
,
a
dark
speck
in
the
cloudy
night
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
,
when
we
were
returning
to
London
outside
the
coach
,
Mrs
Gummidge
and
her
basket
were
on
the
seat
behind
,
and
Mrs
Gummidge
was
happy
.

Chapter
52
.
<EOS>
I
assist
at
an
explosion
 
<EOS>
When
the
time
Mr
Micawber
had
appointed
so
mysteriously
,
was
within
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
of
being
come
,
my
aunt
and
I
consulted
how
we
should
proceed
;
for
my
aunt
was
very
unwilling
to
leave
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
how
easily
I
carried
Dora
up
and
down
stairs
,
now
!
   
<EOS>
We
were
disposed
,
notwithstanding
Mr
Micawber
's
stipulation
for
my
aunt
's
attendance
,
to
arrange
that
she
should
stay
at
home
,
and
be
represented
by
Mr
Dick
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
we
had
resolved
to
take
this
course
,
when
Dora
again
unsettled
us
by
declaring
that
she
never
would
forgive
herself
,
and
never
would
forgive
her
bad
boy
,
if
my
aunt
remained
behind
,
on
any
pretence
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
speak
to
you
,
"
said
Dora
,
shaking
her
curls
at
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
disagreeable
!
<EOS>
I
'll
make
Jip
bark
at
you
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
sure
that
you
really
are
a
cross
old
thing
,
if
you
do
n't
go
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tut
,
Blossom
!
<EOS>
"
laughed
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
you
ca
n't
do
without
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
can
,
"
said
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
no
use
to
me
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
run
up
and
down
stairs
for
me
,
all
day
long
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
sit
and
tell
me
stories
about
Doady
,
when
his
shoes
were
worn
out
,
and
he
was
covered
with
dust
---
<EOS>
oh
,
what
a
poor
little
mite
of
a
fellow
!
<EOS>
You
never
do
anything
at
all
to
please
me
,
do
you
,
dear
?
"
<EOS>
Dora
made
haste
to
kiss
my
aunt
,
and
say
,
"
Yes
,
you
do
!
<EOS>
I
'm
only
joking
!
"
<EOS>
---
lest
my
aunt
should
think
she
really
meant
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
aunt
,
"
said
Dora
,
coaxingly
,
"
now
listen
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
tease
you
,
'
till
you
let
me
have
my
own
way
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
lead
my
naughty
boy
<EOS>
such
a
life
,
if
he
do
n't
make
you
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
make
myself
so
disagreeable
---
and
so
will
Jip
!
<EOS>
You
'll
wish
you
had
gone
,
like
a
good
thing
,
for
ever
and
ever
so
long
,
if
you
do
n't
go
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
"
said
Dora
,
putting
back
her
hair
,
and
looking
wonderingly
at
my
aunt
and
me
,
<EOS>
"
why
should
n't
you
both
go
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
very
ill
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Am
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
a
question
!
<EOS>
"
cried
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
fancy
!
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
I
know
I
am
a
silly
little
thing
!
"
said
Dora
,
slowly
looking
from
one
of
us
to
the
other
,
and
then
putting
up
her
pretty
lips
to
kiss
us
as
she
lay
upon
her
couch
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
you
must
both
go
,
or
I
shall
not
believe
you
;
and
then
I
shall
cry
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
saw
,
in
my
aunt
's
face
,
that
she
began
to
give
way
now
,
and
Dora
brightened
again
,
as
she
saw
it
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
come
back
with
so
much
to
tell
me
,
that
it
'll
take
at
least
a
week
to
make
me
understand
!
"
said
Dora
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
I
know
I
sha
n't
understand
,
for
a
length
of
time
,
if
there
's
any
business
in
it
.
<EOS>
And
there
's
sure
to
be
some
business
in
it
!
<EOS>
If
there
's
anything
to
add
up
,
besides
,
I
do
n't
know
when
I
shall
make
it
out
;
and
my
bad
boy
will
look
so
miserable
all
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
Now
you
'll
go
,
wo
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
'll
only
be
gone
one
night
,
and
Jip
will
take
care
of
me
while
you
are
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Doady
will
carry
me
upstairs
before
you
go
,
and
I
wo
n't
come
down
again
till
you
come
back
;
and
you
shall
take
Agnes
a
dreadfully
scolding
letter
from
me
,
because
she
has
never
been
to
see
us
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
agreed
,
without
any
more
consultation
,
that
we
would
both
go
,
and
that
Dora
was
a
little
Impostor
,
who
feigned
to
be
rather
unwell
,
because
she
liked
to
be
petted
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
greatly
pleased
,
and
very
merry
;
and
we
four
,
that
is
to
say
,
my
aunt
,
Mr
Dick
,
Traddles
,
and
I
,
went
down
to
Canterbury
by
the
Dover
mail
that
night
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
hotel
where
Mr
Micawber
had
requested
us
to
await
him
,
<EOS>
which
we
got
into
,
with
some
trouble
,
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
I
found
a
letter
,
importing
that
he
would
appear
in
the
morning
punctually
at
half
past
nine
.
 
<EOS>
After
which
,
we
went
shivering
,
at
that
uncomfortable
hour
,
to
our
respective
beds
,
through
various
close
passages
;
which
smelt
as
if
they
had
been
steeped
,
for
ages
,
in
a
solution
of
soup
and
stables
.
   
<EOS>
Early
in
the
morning
,
I
sauntered
through
the
dear
old
tranquil
streets
,
and
again
mingled
with
the
shadows
of
the
venerable
gateways
and
churches
.
 
<EOS>
The
rooks
were
sailing
about
the
cathedral
towers
;
and
the
towers
themselves
,
overlooking
many
a
long
unaltered
mile
of
the
rich
country
and
its
pleasant
streams
,
were
cutting
the
bright
morning
air
,
as
if
there
were
no
such
thing
as
change
on
earth
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
the
bells
,
when
they
sounded
,
told
me
sorrowfully
of
change
in
everything
;
told
me
of
their
own
age
,
and
my
pretty
Dora
's
youth
;
and
of
the
many
,
never
old
,
who
had
lived
and
loved
and
died
,
while
the
reverberations
of
the
bells
had
hummed
through
the
rusty
armour
of
the
Black
Prince
hanging
up
within
,
and
,
motes
upon
the
deep
of
Time
,
had
lost
themselves
in
air
,
as
circles
do
in
water
.
   
<EOS>
I
looked
at
the
old
house
from
the
corner
of
the
street
,
but
did
not
go
nearer
to
it
,
lest
,
being
observed
,
I
might
unwittingly
do
any
harm
to
the
design
I
had
come
to
aid
.
 
<EOS>
The
early
sun
was
striking
edgewise
on
its
gables
and
lattice
-
windows
,
touching
them
with
gold
;
and
some
beams
of
its
old
peace
seemed
to
touch
my
heart
.
   
<EOS>
I
strolled
into
the
country
for
an
hour
or
so
,
and
then
returned
by
the
main
street
,
which
in
the
interval
had
shaken
off
its
last
night
's
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Among
those
who
were
stirring
in
the
shops
,
I
saw
my
ancient
enemy
the
butcher
,
now
advanced
to
top
-
boots
and
a
baby
,
and
in
business
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
nursing
the
baby
,
and
appeared
to
be
a
benignant
member
of
society
.
   
<EOS>
We
all
became
very
anxious
and
impatient
,
when
we
sat
down
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
approached
nearer
and
nearer
to
half
past
nine
o'clock
,
our
restless
expectation
of
Mr
Micawber
increased
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
we
made
no
more
pretence
of
attending
to
the
meal
,
which
,
except
with
Mr
Dick
,
had
been
a
mere
form
from
the
first
;
but
my
aunt
walked
up
and
down
the
room
<EOS>
,
Traddles
sat
upon
the
sofa
affecting
to
read
the
paper
with
his
eyes
on
the
ceiling
;
and
I
looked
out
of
the
window
to
give
early
notice
of
Mr
Micawber
's
coming
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
had
I
long
to
watch
,
for
,
<EOS>
at
the
first
chime
of
the
half
hour
,
he
appeared
in
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
he
is
,
"
said
I
,
"
and
not
in
his
legal
attire
!
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
tied
the
strings
of
her
bonnet
(
she
had
come
down
to
breakfast
in
it
)
,
and
put
on
her
shawl
,
as
if
she
were
ready
for
anything
that
was
resolute
and
uncompromising
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
buttoned
his
coat
with
a
determined
air
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
,
disturbed
by
these
formidable
appearances
,
but
feeling
it
necessary
to
imitate
them
,
pulled
his
hat
,
with
both
hands
,
as
firmly
over
his
ears
as
he
possibly
could
;
and
instantly
took
it
off
again
,
to
welcome
Mr
Micawber
.
   
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
and
madam
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
good
morning
!
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
,
"
to
Mr
Dick
,
who
shook
hands
with
him
violently
,
"
you
are
extremely
good
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
breakfasted
?
"
said
Mr
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
a
chop
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
for
the
world
,
my
good
sir
!
"
cried
Mr
Micawber
,
stopping
him
on
his
way
to
the
bell
;
"
appetite
and
myself
,
Mr
Dixon
,
have
long
been
strangers
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dixon
was
so
well
pleased
with
his
new
name
,
and
appeared
to
think
it
so
obliging
in
Mr
Micawber
to
confer
it
upon
him
,
that
he
shook
hands
with
him
again
,
and
laughed
rather
childishly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dick
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
attention
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
recovered
himself
,
with
a
blush
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
sir
,
"
said
my
aunt
to
Mr
Micawber
,
as
she
put
on
her
gloves
,
"
we
are
ready
for
Mount
Vesuvius
,
or
anything
else
,
as
soon
as
YOU
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
returned
Mr
Micawber
,
"
<EOS>
I
trust
you
will
shortly
witness
an
eruption
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Traddles
,
I
have
your
permission
,
I
believe
,
to
mention
here
that
we
have
been
in
communication
together
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
undoubtedly
the
fact
,
Copperfield
,
"
said
Traddles
,
to
whom
I
looked
in
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Micawber
has
consulted
me
in
reference
to
what
he
has
in
contemplation
;
and
I
have
advised
him
to
the
best
of
my
judgement
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Unless
I
deceive
myself
,
Mr
Traddles
,
"
pursued
Mr
Micawber
,
"
what
I
contemplate
is
a
disclosure
of
an
important
nature
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Highly
so
,
"
said
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
under
such
circumstances
,
madam
and
gentlemen
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
you
will
do
me
the
favour
to
submit
yourselves
,
for
the
moment
,
to
the
direction
of
one
who
,
however
unworthy
to
be
regarded
in
any
other
light
but
as
a
Waif
and
Stray
upon
the
shore
of
human
nature
,
is
still
your
fellow
-
man
,
though
crushed
out
of
his
original
form
by
individual
errors
,
and
the
accumulative
force
of
a
combination
of
circumstances
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
perfect
confidence
in
you
,
Mr
Micawber
,
"
said
I
,
"
and
will
do
what
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
returned
Mr
Micawber
,
"
your
confidence
is
not
,
at
the
existing
juncture
,
ill
-
bestowed
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
beg
to
be
allowed
a
start
of
five
minutes
by
the
clock
;
and
then
to
receive
the
present
company
,
inquiring
for
Miss
Wickfield
,
at
the
office
of
Wickfield
and
Heep
,
whose
Stipendiary
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
and
I
looked
at
Traddles
,
who
nodded
his
approval
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
more
,
"
observed
Mr
Micawber
,
"
to
say
at
present
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
which
,
to
my
infinite
surprise
,
he
included
us
all
in
a
comprehensive
bow
,
and
disappeared
;
his
manner
being
extremely
distant
,
and
his
face
extremely
pale
.
   
<EOS>
Traddles
only
smiled
,
and
shook
his
head
(
with
his
hair
standing
upright
on
the
top
of
it
)
,
when
I
looked
to
him
for
an
explanation
;
so
I
took
out
my
watch
,
and
,
as
a
last
resource
,
counted
off
the
five
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
with
her
own
watch
in
her
hand
,
did
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
time
was
expired
,
Traddles
gave
her
his
arm
;
and
we
all
went
out
together
to
the
old
house
,
without
saying
one
word
on
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
We
found
Mr
Micawber
at
his
desk
,
in
the
turret
office
on
the
ground
floor
,
either
writing
,
or
pretending
to
write
,
hard
.
 
<EOS>
The
large
office
-
ruler
was
stuck
into
his
waistcoat
,
and
was
not
so
well
concealed
but
that
a
foot
or
more
of
that
instrument
protruded
from
his
bosom
,
like
a
new
kind
of
shirt
-
frill
.
   
<EOS>
As
it
appeared
to
me
that
I
was
expected
to
speak
,
I
said
aloud
:
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Mr
Micawber
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
gravely
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
I
see
you
well
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Miss
Wickfield
at
home
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Wickfield
is
unwell
in
bed
,
sir
,
of
a
rheumatic
fever
,
"
he
returned
;
"
but
Miss
Wickfield
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
will
be
happy
to
see
old
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
walk
in
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
preceded
us
to
the
dining
-
room
---
the
first
room
I
had
entered
in
that
house
---
and
flinging
open
the
door
of
Mr
Wickfield
's
former
office
,
said
,
in
a
sonorous
voice
:
   
"
Miss
Trotwood
,
Mr
David
Copperfield
,
Mr
Thomas
Traddles
,
and
Mr
Dixon
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
had
not
seen
Uriah
Heep
since
the
time
of
the
blow
.
 
<EOS>
Our
visit
astonished
him
,
evidently
;
not
the
less
,
I
dare
say
,
because
it
astonished
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
gather
his
eyebrows
together
,
for
he
had
none
worth
mentioning
;
but
he
frowned
to
that
degree
that
he
almost
closed
his
small
eyes
,
while
the
hurried
raising
of
his
grisly
hand
to
his
chin
betrayed
some
trepidation
or
surprise
.
<EOS>
This
was
only
when
we
were
in
the
act
of
entering
his
room
,
and
when
I
caught
a
glance
at
him
over
my
aunt
's
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
A
moment
afterwards
,
he
was
as
fawning
and
as
humble
as
ever
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
am
sure
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
indeed
an
unexpected
pleasure
!
<EOS>
To
have
,
as
I
may
say
,
all
friends
round
<EOS>
St
Paul
's
at
once
,
is
a
treat
unlooked
for
!
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
I
hope
I
see
you
well
,
and
---
if
I
may
umbly
express
myself
so
---
friendly
towards
them
as
is
ever
your
friends
,
whether
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Copperfield
,
sir
<EOS>
,
I
hope
she
's
getting
on
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
been
made
quite
uneasy
by
the
poor
accounts
we
have
had
of
her
state
,
lately
,
I
do
assure
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
felt
ashamed
to
let
him
take
my
hand
,
but
I
did
not
know
yet
what
else
to
do
.
   
<EOS>
"
Things
are
changed
in
this
office
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
since
I
was
an
umble
clerk
,
and
held
your
pony
;
ai
n't
they
?
"
said
Uriah
,
with
his
sickliest
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
not
changed
,
Miss
Trotwood
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
returned
my
aunt
,
"
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
think
you
are
pretty
constant
to
the
promise
of
your
youth
;
if
that
's
any
satisfaction
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
"
said
Uriah
,
writhing
in
his
ungainly
manner
,
"
for
your
good
opinion
!
<EOS>
Micawber
,
tell
'em
to
let
Miss
Agnes
know
---
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Mother
will
be
quite
in
a
state
,
when
she
sees
the
present
company
!
"
said
Uriah
,
setting
chairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
busy
,
Mr
Heep
?
"
said
Traddles
,
whose
eye
the
cunning
red
eye
accidentally
caught
,
as
it
at
once
scrutinized
and
evaded
us
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
Mr
Traddles
,
"
replied
Uriah
,
resuming
his
official
seat
,
and
squeezing
his
bony
hands
,
laid
palm
to
palm
between
his
bony
knees
.
<EOS>
"
Not
so
much
so
as
I
could
wish
.
 
<EOS>
But
lawyers
,
sharks
,
and
leeches
,
are
not
easily
satisfied
,
you
know
!
<EOS>
Not
but
what
myself
and
Micawber
have
our
hands
pretty
full
,
in
general
,
on
account
of
Mr
Wickfield
's
being
hardly
fit
for
any
occupation
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
a
pleasure
as
well
as
a
duty
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
to
work
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
've
not
been
intimate
with
Mr
Wickfield
,
I
think
,
<EOS>
Mr
Traddles
?
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
've
only
had
the
honour
of
seeing
you
once
myself
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
have
not
been
intimate
with
Mr
Wickfield
,
"
returned
Traddles
;
"
or
I
might
perhaps
have
waited
on
you
long
ago
,
Mr
Heep
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
the
tone
of
this
reply
,
which
made
Uriah
look
at
the
speaker
again
,
with
a
very
sinister
and
suspicious
expression
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
seeing
only
Traddles
,
with
his
good
-
natured
face
,
simple
manner
,
and
hair
on
end
,
he
dismissed
it
as
he
replied
,
with
a
jerk
of
his
whole
body
,
but
especially
his
throat
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
that
,
Mr
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
have
admired
him
as
much
as
we
all
do
.
 
<EOS>
His
little
failings
would
only
have
endeared
him
to
you
the
more
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
you
would
like
to
hear
my
fellow
-
partner
eloquently
spoken
of
,
I
should
refer
you
to
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
The
family
is
a
subject
<EOS>
he
's
very
strong
upon
,
if
you
never
heard
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
prevented
from
disclaiming
the
compliment
(
if
I
should
have
done
so
,
in
any
case
)
,
by
the
entrance
of
Agnes
,
now
ushered
in
by
Mr
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
not
quite
so
self
-
possessed
as
usual
,
I
thought
;
and
had
evidently
undergone
anxiety
and
fatigue
.
 
<EOS>
But
her
earnest
cordiality
,
and
her
quiet
beauty
,
shone
with
the
gentler
lustre
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
saw
Uriah
watch
her
while
she
greeted
us
;
and
he
reminded
me
of
an
ugly
and
rebellious
genie
watching
a
good
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
,
some
slight
sign
passed
between
Mr
Micawber
and
Traddles
;
and
Traddles
,
unobserved
except
by
me
,
went
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
wait
,
Micawber
,
"
said
Uriah
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
with
his
hand
upon
the
ruler
in
his
breast
,
stood
erect
before
the
door
,
most
unmistakably
contemplating
one
of
his
fellow
-
men
,
and
that
man
his
employer
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
waiting
for
?
"
said
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
Micawber
!
<EOS>
did
you
hear
me
tell
you
not
to
wait
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
"
replied
the
immovable
Mr
Micawber
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
why
DO
you
wait
?
"
said
Uriah
.
   
<EOS>
"
Because
I
---
in
short
,
choose
,
"
replied
Mr
Micawber
,
with
a
burst
.
   
<EOS>
Uriah
's
cheeks
lost
colour
,
and
an
unwholesome
paleness
,
still
faintly
tinged
by
his
pervading
red
,
overspread
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
Mr
Micawber
attentively
,
with
his
whole
face
breathing
short
and
quick
in
every
feature
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
dissipated
fellow
,
as
all
the
world
knows
,
"
he
said
,
with
an
effort
at
a
smile
,
"
and
I
am
afraid
you
'll
oblige
me
to
get
rid
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
Go
along
!
<EOS>
I
'll
talk
to
you
presently
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
there
is
a
scoundrel
on
this
earth
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
suddenly
breaking
out
again
with
the
utmost
vehemence
,
"
with
whom
I
have
already
talked
too
much
,
that
scoundrel
's
name
is
---
HEEP
!
"
   
<EOS>
Uriah
fell
back
,
as
if
he
had
been
struck
or
stung
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
slowly
round
upon
us
with
the
darkest
and
wickedest
expression
that
his
face
could
wear
,
he
said
,
in
a
lower
voice
:
   
<EOS>
"
Oho
!
<EOS>
This
is
a
conspiracy
!
<EOS>
You
have
met
here
by
appointment
!
<EOS>
You
are
playing
Booty
with
my
clerk
,
are
you
,
Copperfield
?
 
<EOS>
Now
,
take
care
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
make
nothing
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
We
understand
each
other
,
you
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
no
love
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
always
a
puppy
with
a
proud
stomach
,
from
your
first
coming
here
;
and
you
envy
me
my
rise
,
do
you
?
 
<EOS>
None
of
your
plots
against
me
;
I
'll
counterplot
you
!
<EOS>
Micawber
,
you
be
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
talk
to
you
presently
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Micawber
,
"
said
I
,
"
there
is
a
sudden
change
in
this
fellow
.
<EOS>
in
more
respects
than
the
extraordinary
one
of
his
speaking
the
truth
in
one
particular
,
which
assures
me
that
he
is
brought
to
bay
.
 
<EOS>
Deal
with
him
as
he
deserves
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
precious
set
of
people
,
ai
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
said
Uriah
,
in
the
same
low
voice
,
and
breaking
out
into
a
clammy
heat
,
which
he
wiped
from
his
forehead
,
with
his
long
lean
hand
,
"
to
buy
over
my
clerk
,
who
is
the
very
scum
of
society
,
---
as
you
yourself
were
,
Copperfield
<EOS>
,
you
know
it
,
before
anyone
had
charity
on
you
,
---
to
defame
me
with
his
lies
?
 
<EOS>
Miss
Trotwood
,
you
had
better
stop
this
;
or
I
'll
stop
your
husband
shorter
than
will
be
pleasant
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
know
your
story
professionally
,
for
nothing
,
old
lady
!
<EOS>
Miss
Wickfield
,
if
you
have
any
love
for
your
father
,
you
had
better
not
join
that
gang
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
ruin
him
,
if
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
come
!
<EOS>
I
have
got
some
of
you
under
the
harrow
.
 
<EOS>
Think
twice
,
before
it
goes
over
you
.
 
<EOS>
Think
twice
,
you
,
Micawber
,
if
you
do
n't
want
to
be
crushed
.
<EOS>
I
recommend
you
to
take
yourself
off
,
and
be
talked
to
presently
,
you
fool
!
<EOS>
while
there
's
time
to
retreat
.
 
<EOS>
Where
's
mother
?
"
he
said
,
suddenly
appearing
to
notice
,
with
alarm
,
the
absence
of
Traddles
,
and
pulling
down
the
bell
-
rope
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fine
doings
in
a
person
's
own
house
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Heep
is
here
,
sir
,
"
said
Traddles
,
returning
with
that
worthy
mother
of
a
worthy
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
taken
the
liberty
of
making
myself
known
to
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
to
make
yourself
known
?
"
<EOS>
retorted
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
want
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
agent
and
friend
of
Mr
Wickfield
,
sir
,
"
said
Traddles
,
in
a
composed
and
business
-
like
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
have
a
power
of
attorney
from
him
in
my
pocket
,
to
act
for
him
in
all
matters
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
old
ass
has
drunk
himself
into
a
state
of
dotage
,
"
said
Uriah
,
turning
uglier
than
before
,
"
and
it
has
been
got
from
him
by
fraud
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Something
has
been
got
from
him
by
fraud
,
I
know
,
"
returned
Traddles
quietly
;
"
and
so
do
you
,
Mr
Heep
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
refer
that
question
,
if
you
please
,
to
Mr
Micawber
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ury
---
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Heep
began
,
with
an
anxious
gesture
.
   
<EOS>
"
YOU
hold
your
tongue
,
mother
,
"
he
returned
;
"
least
said
,
soonest
mended
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
Ury
---
"
   
"
Will
you
hold
your
tongue
,
mother
,
and
leave
it
to
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
Though
I
had
long
known
that
his
servility
was
false
,
and
all
his
pretences
knavish
and
hollow
,
I
had
had
no
adequate
conception
of
the
extent
of
his
hypocrisy
,
until
I
now
saw
him
with
his
mask
off
.
<EOS>
The
suddenness
with
which
he
dropped
it
,
when
he
perceived
that
it
was
useless
to
him
;
the
malice
,
insolence
,
and
hatred
<EOS>
,
he
revealed
;
the
leer
with
which
he
exulted
,
even
at
this
moment
,
in
the
evil
he
had
done
---
all
this
time
being
desperate
too
,
and
at
his
wits
'
end
for
the
means
of
getting
the
better
of
us
---
though
perfectly
consistent
with
the
experience
I
had
of
him
,
at
first
took
even
me
by
surprise
,
who
had
known
him
so
long
,
and
disliked
him
so
heartily
.
   
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
of
the
look
he
conferred
on
me
,
as
he
stood
eyeing
us
,
one
after
another
;
for
I
had
always
understood
that
he
hated
me
,
and
I
remembered
the
marks
of
my
hand
upon
his
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
his
eyes
passed
on
to
Agnes
,
and
I
saw
the
rage
with
which
he
felt
his
power
over
her
slipping
away
,
and
the
exhibition
,
in
their
disappointment
,
of
the
odious
passions
that
had
led
him
to
aspire
to
one
whose
virtues
he
could
never
appreciate
or
care
for
,
I
was
shocked
by
the
mere
thought
of
her
having
lived
,
an
hour
,
within
sight
of
such
a
man
.
   
<EOS>
After
some
rubbing
of
the
lower
part
of
his
face
,
and
some
looking
at
us
with
those
bad
eyes
,
over
his
grisly
fingers
,
he
made
one
more
address
to
me
,
half
whining
,
and
half
abusive
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
think
it
justifiable
,
do
you
,
<EOS>
Copperfield
,
you
who
pride
yourself
so
much
on
your
honour
and
all
the
rest
of
it
,
to
sneak
about
my
place
,
eaves
-
dropping
with
my
clerk
?
 
<EOS>
If
it
had
been
ME
,
I
should
n't
have
wondered
;
for
I
do
n't
make
myself
out
a
gentleman
(
though
I
never
was
in
the
streets
either
,
as
you
were
,
according
to
Micawber
)
,
but
being
you
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
And
you
're
not
afraid
of
doing
this
,
either
?
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
think
at
all
of
what
I
shall
do
,
in
return
;
or
of
getting
yourself
into
trouble
for
conspiracy
and
so
forth
?
 
<EOS>
Very
well
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
see
!
<EOS>
Mr
What's
-
your
-
name
,
you
were
going
to
refer
some
question
to
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
your
referee
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
make
him
speak
?
 
<EOS>
He
has
learnt
his
lesson
,
I
see
.
"
   
<EOS>
Seeing
that
what
he
said
had
no
effect
on
me
or
any
of
us
,
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
table
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
one
of
his
splay
feet
twisted
round
the
other
leg
,
waiting
doggedly
for
what
might
follow
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
whose
impetuosity
I
had
restrained
thus
far
with
the
greatest
difficulty
,
and
who
had
repeatedly
interposed
with
the
first
syllable
Of
SCOUN
-
drel
!
<EOS>
without
getting
to
the
second
,
now
burst
forward
,
drew
the
ruler
from
his
breast
(
apparently
as
a
defensive
weapon
)
,
and
produced
from
his
pocket
a
foolscap
document
,
folded
in
the
form
of
a
large
letter
.
 
<EOS>
Opening
this
packet
,
with
his
old
flourish
,
and
glancing
at
the
contents
<EOS>
,
as
if
he
cherished
an
artistic
admiration
of
their
style
of
composition
,
he
began
to
read
as
follows
:
   
"
<EOS>
"
Dear
Miss
Trotwood
and
gentlemen
---
"
"
   
"
Bless
and
save
the
man
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
my
aunt
in
a
low
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
'd
write
letters
by
the
ream
,
if
it
was
a
capital
offence
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
without
hearing
her
,
went
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
In
appearing
before
you
to
denounce
probably
the
most
consummate
Villain
that
has
ever
existed
,
"
"
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
without
looking
off
the
letter
,
pointed
the
ruler
,
like
a
ghostly
truncheon
,
at
Uriah
Heep
,
"
"
I
ask
no
consideration
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
The
victim
,
from
my
cradle
,
of
pecuniary
liabilities
to
which
I
have
been
unable
to
respond
,
I
have
ever
been
the
sport
and
toy
of
debasing
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
Ignominy
,
Want
,
Despair
,
and
Madness
,
have
,
collectively
or
separately
,
been
the
attendants
of
my
career
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
The
relish
with
which
Mr
Micawber
described
himself
as
a
prey
to
these
dismal
calamities
,
was
only
to
be
equalled
by
the
emphasis
with
which
he
read
his
letter
;
and
the
kind
of
homage
he
rendered
to
it
with
a
roll
of
his
head
,
when
he
thought
he
had
hit
a
sentence
very
hard
indeed
.
   
"
"
In
an
accumulation
of
Ignominy
,
Want
,
Despair
,
and
Madness
,
I
entered
the
office
---
or
,
as
our
lively
neighbour
the
Gaul
would
term
it
,
the
Bureau
---
of
the
Firm
,
nominally
conducted
under
the
appellation
of
Wickfield
and
---
HEEP
,
but
in
reality
,
wielded
by
---
HEEP
alone
.
 
<EOS>
HEEP
,
and
only
HEEP
,
is
the
mainspring
of
that
machine
.
 
<EOS>
HEEP
,
and
only
HEEP
,
is
the
Forger
and
the
Cheat
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
Uriah
,
more
blue
than
white
at
these
words
,
made
a
dart
at
the
letter
,
as
if
to
tear
it
in
pieces
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
with
a
perfect
miracle
of
dexterity
or
luck
,
caught
his
advancing
knuckles
with
the
ruler
,
and
disabled
his
right
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
dropped
at
the
wrist
,
as
if
it
were
broken
.
 
<EOS>
The
blow
sounded
as
if
it
had
fallen
on
wood
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
Devil
take
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
Uriah
,
writhing
in
a
new
way
with
pain
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
even
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Approach
me
again
,
you
---
you
---
you
HEEP
of
infamy
,
"
gasped
Mr
Micawber
,
"
and
if
your
head
is
human
,
I
'll
break
it
.
 
<EOS>
Come
on
,
come
on
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
think
I
never
saw
anything
more
ridiculous
<EOS>
---
I
was
sensible
of
it
,
even
at
the
time
---
than
Mr
Micawber
making
broad
-
sword
guards
with
the
ruler
,
and
crying
,
"
Come
on
!
"
<EOS>
while
Traddles
and
I
pushed
him
back
into
a
corner
,
from
which
,
as
often
as
we
got
him
into
it
,
he
persisted
in
emerging
again
.
   
<EOS>
His
enemy
,
muttering
to
himself
,
after
wringing
his
wounded
hand
for
sometime
,
slowly
drew
off
his
neck
-
kerchief
and
bound
it
up
;
then
held
it
in
his
other
hand
,
and
sat
upon
his
table
with
his
sullen
face
looking
down
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
when
he
was
sufficiently
cool
,
proceeded
with
his
letter
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
The
stipendiary
emoluments
in
consideration
of
which
I
entered
into
the
service
of

HEEP
,

always
pausing
before
that
word
and
uttering
it
with
astonishing
vigour
,
"
"
were
not
defined
,
beyond
the
pittance
of
twenty
-
two
shillings
and
six
per
week
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
was
left
contingent
on
the
value
of
my
professional
exertions
;
in
other
and
more
expressive
words
,
on
the
baseness
of
my
nature
,
the
cupidity
of
my
motives
,
the
poverty
of
my
family
,
the
general
moral
(
or
rather
immoral
)
resemblance
between
myself
and
---
HEEP
.
 
<EOS>
Need
<EOS>
I
say
,
that
it
soon
became
necessary
for
me
to
solicit
from
---
HEEP
---
<EOS>
pecuniary
advances
towards
the
support
of
Mrs
Micawber
,
and
our
blighted
but
rising
family
?
 
<EOS>
Need
<EOS>
I
say
that
this
necessity
had
been
foreseen
by
---
HEEP
?
 
<EOS>
That
those
advances
were
secured
by
IOU
's
and
other
similar
acknowledgements
,
known
to
the
legal
institutions
of
this
country
?
 
<EOS>
And
that
I
thus
became
immeshed
in
the
web
he
had
spun
for
my
reception
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
   
Mr
Micawber
's
enjoyment
of
his
epistolary
powers
,
in
describing
this
unfortunate
state
of
things
,
really
seemed
to
outweigh
any
pain
or
anxiety
that
the
reality
could
have
caused
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
read
on
:
   
"
<EOS>
"
Then
it
was
that
---
HEEP
---
<EOS>
began
to
favour
me
with
just
so
much
of
his
confidence
,
as
was
necessary
to
the
discharge
of
his
infernal
business
.
 
<EOS>
Then
it
was
that
I
began
,
if
I
may
so
Shakespearianly
express
myself
,
to
dwindle
,
peak
,
and
pine
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
that
my
services
were
constantly
called
into
requisition
for
the
falsification
of
business
,
and
the
mystification
of
an
individual
whom
I
will
designate
as
Mr
W.
 
<EOS>
That
Mr
W
was
imposed
upon
,
kept
in
ignorance
,
and
deluded
,
in
every
possible
way
;
yet
,
that
all
this
while
,
the
ruffian
---
HEEP
---
was
professing
unbounded
gratitude
to
,
and
unbounded
friendship
for
,
that
much
-
abused
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
bad
enough
;
but
,
as
the
philosophic
Dane
observes
,
with
that
universal
applicability
which
distinguishes
the
illustrious
ornament
of
the
Elizabethan
Era
,
worse
remains
behind
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
Mr
Micawber
was
so
very
much
struck
by
this
happy
rounding
off
with
a
quotation
,
that
he
indulged
himself
,
and
us
,
with
a
second
reading
of
the
sentence
,
under
pretence
of
having
lost
his
place
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
It
is
not
my
intention
,
"
"
he
continued
reading
on
,
"
"
to
enter
on
a
detailed
list
,
within
the
compass
of
the
present
epistle
(
though
it
is
ready
elsewhere
)
,
of
the
various
malpractices
of
a
minor
nature
,
affecting
the
individual
whom
I
have
denominated
Mr
W
,
to
which
I
have
been
a
tacitly
consenting
party
.
 
<EOS>
My
object
,
when
the
contest
within
myself
between
stipend
and
no
stipend
,
baker
and
no
baker
,
existence
and
non

existence
,
ceased

was
to
take
advantage

committed

grievous
wrong

by
a
no
less
touching

appealing
monitor
without

to
whom
I
will
briefly
refer

I
entered
on

clandestine
investigation

protracted

now
,
to
the
best
of

information

belief
,
over
a
period
exceeding
twelve
calendar

<EOS>
He
read
this
passage
as
if
it
were
from
an
Act
of
Parliament

appeared
majestically
refreshed
by
the
sound
of
the
words

My
charges

read

convenient
position
under

left
arm
,
in
case
of
need
,
"
"
are
as
follows

"
<EOS>
"
   
We
all
held
our
breath

I
think

<EOS>
I
am
sure
Uriah
held

<EOS>
"
"
First
,
"
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
"
When
Mr
W
's
faculties
and
memory
for
business
became
,
through
causes
into
which
it
is
not
necessary
or
expedient
for
me
to
enter
,
weakened
and
confused
,
---
HEEP
---
designedly
perplexed
and
complicated
the
whole
of
the
official
transactions
.
 
<EOS>
When
Mr
W
was
least
fit
to
enter
on
business
,
---
HEEP
was
always
at
hand
to
force
him
to
enter
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
obtained
Mr
W
's
signature
under
such
circumstances
to
documents
of
importance
,
representing
them
to
be
other
documents
of
no
importance
.
 
<EOS>
He
induced
Mr
W
to
empower
him
to
draw
out
,
thus
,
one
particular
sum
of
trust
-
money
,
amounting
to
twelve
six
fourteen
,
two
and
nine
,
and
employed
it
to
meet
pretended
business
charges
and
deficiencies
which
were
either
already
provided
for
,
or
had
never
really
existed
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
this
proceeding
,
throughout
,
the
appearance
of
having
originated
in
Mr
W
's
own
dishonest
intention
,
and
of
having
been
accomplished
by
Mr
W
's
own
dishonest
act
;
and
has
used
it
,
ever
since
,
to
torture
and
constrain
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
You
shall
prove
this
,
you
Copperfield
!
"
said
Uriah
,
with
a
threatening
shake
of
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
in
good
time

<EOS>
"
Ask
---
HEEP
---
<EOS>
Mr
Traddles
,
who
lived
in
his
house
after
him
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
breaking
off
from
the
letter
;
"
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
fool
himself
---
and
lives
there
now

said
Uriah
,
disdainfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ask
---
HEEP
---
if
he
ever
kept
a
pocket
-
book
in
that
house
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
;
"
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
saw
Uriah
's
lank
hand
stop
,
involuntarily
,
in
the
scraping
of
his
chin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Or
ask
him
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
if
he
ever
burnt
one
there
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
says
yes
,
and
asks
you
where
the
ashes
are
,
refer
him
to
Wilkins
Micawber
,
and
he
will
hear
of
something
not
at
all
to
his
advantage
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
triumphant
flourish
with
which
Mr
Micawber
delivered
himself
of
these
words
,
had
a
powerful
effect
in
alarming
the
mother
;
who
cried
out
,
in
much
agitation
:
   
<EOS>
"
Ury
,
Ury

Be
umble
,
and
make
terms

my
dear

<EOS>
"
Mother
!

<EOS>
he
retorted
,
"
will
you
keep
quiet
?
 
<EOS>
You
're
in
a
fright
,
and
do
n't
know
what
you
say
or
mean
.
 
<EOS>
Umble
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeated
,
looking
at
me
,
with
a
snarl
;
"
I
've
umbled
some
of
'em
for
a
pretty
long
time
back

umble
as
I
was

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
genteelly
adjusting
his
chin
in
his
cravat
,
presently
proceeded
with
his
composition

Second

<EOS>
HEEP
has
,
on
several
occasions
,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
,
information
,
and
belief
,
systematically
forged
,
to
various
entries
,
books
,
and
documents
,
the
signature
of
Mr
W
;
and
has
distinctly
done
so
in
one
instance
,
capable
of
proof
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
To
wit
,
in
manner
following
<EOS>
,
that
is
to
say
:
"
"
   
Again
,
Mr
Micawber
had
a
relish
in
this
formal
piling
up
of
words
,
which
,
however
ludicrously
displayed
in
his
case
,
was
,
I
must
say
,
not
at
all
peculiar
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
observed
it
,
in
the
course
of
my
life
,
in
numbers
of
men
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
to
be
a
general
rule
.
<EOS>
In
the
taking
of
legal
oaths
,
for
instance
,
deponents
seem
to
enjoy
themselves
mightily
when
they
come
to
several
good
words
in
succession
,
for
the
expression
of
one
idea
;
as
,
that
they
utterly
detest
,
abominate
,
and
abjure
,
or
so
forth
;
and
the
old
anathemas
were
made
relishing
on
the
same
principle
.
 
<EOS>
We
talk
about
the
tyranny
of
words
,
but
we
like
to
tyrannize
over
them
too
;
we
are
fond
of
having
a
large
superfluous
establishment
of
words
to
wait
upon
us
on
great
occasions
;
we
think
it
looks
important
,
and
sounds
well
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
are
not
particular
about
the
meaning
of
our
liveries
on
state
occasions
,
if
they
be
but
fine
and
numerous
enough
,
so
,
the
meaning
or
necessity
of
our
words
is
a
secondary
consideration
,
if
there
be
but
a
great
parade
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
individuals
get
into
trouble
by
making
too
great
a
show
of
liveries
,
or
as
slaves
when
they
are
too
numerous
rise
against
their
masters
,
so
I
think
I
could
mention
a
nation
that
has
got
into
many
great
difficulties
,
and
will
get
into
many
greater
,
from
maintaining
too
large
a
retinue
of
words
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
read
on
,
almost
smacking
his
lips
:
   
"
"
To
wit
,
in
manner
following
,
that
is
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
W
being
infirm
,
and
it
being
within
the
bounds
of
probability
that
his
decease
might
lead
to
some
discoveries
,
and
to
the
downfall
of
---
HEEP
'S
---
power
over
the
W
family
,
---
as
I
,
Wilkins
Micawber
,
the
undersigned
,
assume
---
<EOS>
unless
the
filial
affection
of
his
daughter
could
be
secretly
influenced
from
allowing
any
investigation
of
the
partnership
affairs
to
be
ever
made
,
the
said
---
HEEP
---
deemed
it
expedient
to
have
a
bond
ready
by
him
,
as
from
Mr
W
,
for
the
before
-
mentioned
sum
of
twelve
six
fourteen
,
two
and
nine
,
with
interest
,
stated
therein
to
have
been
advanced
by
---
HEEP
---
to
Mr
W
to
save
Mr
W
from
dishonour
;
though
really
the
sum
was
never
advanced
by
him
,
and
has
long
been
replaced
.
 
<EOS>
The
signatures
to
this
instrument
purporting
to
be
executed
by
Mr
W
and
attested
by
Wilkins
Micawber
,
are
forgeries
by

HEEP

<EOS>
I
have
,
in
my
possession
,
in

pocket

book
,
several
similar
imitations
of
Mr
W
's
signature
,
here
and

defaced
by
fire
,

legible
to

<EOS>
I
never
attested

the

itself

Uriah
Heep
,
with
a
start
,
took
out
of
his
pocket
a
bunch
of
keys
,
and
opened
a
certain
drawer
;
then
,
suddenly
bethought
himself
of
what
he
was
about
,
and
turned
again
towards
us
,
without
looking
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
And
I
have
the
document
,
"
"
Mr
Micawber
read
again
,
looking
about
as
if
it
were
the
text
of
a
sermon
,
"
"
in
my
possession
,
---
that
is
to
say
,
I
had
,
early
this
morning
,
when
this
was
written
,
but
have
since
relinquished
it
to
Mr
Traddles
.
"
"
   
"
It
is
quite
true
,
"
assented
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ury
,
Ury
!
"
cried
the
mother
,
"
be
umble
and
make
terms
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
my
son
will
be
umble
,
gentlemen
,
if
you
'll
give
him
time
to
think
.
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
I
'm
sure
you
know
that
he
was
always
very
umble
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
singular
to
see
how
the
mother
still
held
to
the
old
trick
,
when
the
son
had
abandoned
it
as
useless
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
he
said
,
with
an
impatient
bite
at
the
handkerchief
in
which
his
hand
was
wrapped
,
"
you
had
better
take
and
fire
a
loaded
gun
at
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
love
you
,
Ury
,
"
cried
Mrs
Heep
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
no
doubt
she
did
;
or
that
he
loved
her
<EOS>
,
however
strange
it
may
appear
;
though
,
to
be
sure
,
they
were
a
congenial
couple
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
ca
n't
bear
to
hear
you
provoking
the
gentlemen
,
and
endangering
of
yourself
more
.
<EOS>
I
told
the
gentleman
at
first
,
when
he
told
me
upstairs
it
was
come
to
light
,
that
I
would
answer
for
your
being
umble
,
and
making
amends
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
see
how
umble
I
am
,
gentlemen
,
and
do
n't
mind
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
there
's
Copperfield
,
mother
,
"
he
angrily
retorted
,
pointing
his
lean
finger
at
me
,
against
whom
all
his
animosity
was
levelled
,
as
the
prime
mover
in
the
discovery
;
and
I
did
not
undeceive
him
;
<EOS>
"
there
's
Copperfield
,
would
have
given
you
a
hundred
pound
to
say
less
than
you
've
blurted
out
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
Ury
,
"
cried
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
see
you
running
into
danger
,
through
carrying
your
head
so
high
.
 
<EOS>
Better
be
umble
,
as
you
always
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
remained
for
a
little
,
biting
the
handkerchief
,
and
then
said
to
me
with
a
scowl
:
   
<EOS>
"
What
more
have
you
got
to
bring
forward
?
 
<EOS>
If
anything
,
go
on
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
look
at
me
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
promptly
resumed
his
letter
,
glad
to
revert
to
a
performance
with
which
he
was
so
highly
satisfied
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Third
.
 
<EOS>
And
last
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
now
in
a
condition
to
show
,
by
---
HEEP
'S
---
false
books
,
and
---
HEEP
'S
---
real
memoranda
,
beginning
with
the
partially
destroyed
pocket
-
book
(
which
I
was
unable
to
comprehend
,
at
the
time
of
its
accidental
discovery
by
Mrs
Micawber
,
on
our
taking
possession
of
our
present
abode
,
in
the
locker
or
bin
devoted
to
the
reception
of
the
ashes
calcined
on
our
domestic
hearth
)
,
that
the
weaknesses
,
the
faults
,
the
very
virtues
,
the
parental
affections
,
and
the
sense
of
honour
,
of
the
unhappy
Mr
W
have
been
for
years
acted
on
by
,
and
warped
to
the
base
purposes
of
---
HEEP
.
 
<EOS>
That
Mr
W
has
been
for
years
deluded
and
plundered
,
in
every
conceivable
manner
,
to
the
pecuniary
aggrandisement
of
the
avaricious
,
false
,
and
grasping
---
HEEP
.
 
<EOS>
That
the
engrossing
object
of
---
HEEP
---
was
,
next
to
gain
,
to
subdue
Mr
and
Miss
W
(
of
his
ulterior
views
in
reference
to
the
latter
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
)
entirely
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
That
his
last
act
,
completed
but
a
few
months
since
,
was
to
induce
Mr
W
to
execute
a
relinquishment
of
his
share
in
the
partnership
,
and
even
a
bill
of
sale
on
the
very
furniture
of
his
house
,
in
consideration
of
a
certain
annuity
,
to
be
well
and
truly
paid
by
---
HEEP
---
on
the
four
common
quarter
-
days
in
each
and
every
year
.
 
<EOS>
That
these
meshes
;
beginning
with
alarming
and
falsified
accounts
of
the
estate
of
which
Mr
W
is
the
receiver
,
at
a
period
when
Mr
W
had
launched
into
imprudent
and
ill
-
judged
speculations
,
and
may
not
have
had
the
money
,
for
which
he
was
morally
and
legally
responsible
,
in
hand
;
going
on
with
pretended
borrowings
of
money
at
enormous
interest
,
really
coming
from
---
HEEP
---
and
by
---
HEEP
---
fraudulently
obtained
or
withheld
from
Mr
W
himself
,
on
pretence
of
such
speculations
or
otherwise
;
perpetuated
by
a
miscellaneous
catalogue
of
unscrupulous
chicaneries
---
gradually
thickened
,
until
the
unhappy
Mr
W
could
see
no
world
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
Bankrupt
,
as
he
believed
,
alike
in
circumstances
,
in
all
other
hope
,
and
in
honour
,
his
sole
reliance
was
upon
the
monster
in
the
garb
of
man
,
"
"
<EOS>
---
Mr
Micawber
made
a
good
deal
of
this
,
as
a
new
turn
of
expression
,
---
"
"
who
,
by
making
himself
necessary
to
him
,
had
achieved
his
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
I
undertake
to
show
.
<EOS>
Probably
much
more
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
whispered
a
few
words
to
Agnes
,
who
was
weeping
,
half
joyfully
,
half
sorrowfully
,
at
my
side
;
and
there
was
a
movement
among
us
,
as
if
Mr
Micawber
had
finished
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
with
exceeding
gravity
,
"
Pardon
me
,
"
and
proceeded
,
with
a
mixture
of
the
lowest
spirits
and
the
most
intense
enjoyment
,
to
the
peroration
of
his
letter
.
    
<EOS>
"
"
I
have
now
concluded
.
 
<EOS>
It
merely
remains
for
me
to
substantiate
these
accusations
;
and
then
,
with
my
ill
-
starred
family
,
to
disappear
from
the
landscape
on
which
we
appear
to
be
an
encumbrance
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
soon
done
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
reasonably
inferred
that
our
baby
will
first
expire
of
inanition
,
as
being
the
frailest
member
of
our
circle
;
and
that
our
twins
will
follow
next
in
order
.
<EOS>
So
be
it
!
<EOS>
For
myself
,
my
Canterbury
Pilgrimage
has
done
much
;
imprisonment
on
civil
process
,
and
want
,
will
soon
do
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
that
the
labour
and
hazard
of
an
investigation
---
of
which
the
smallest
results
have
been
slowly
pieced
together
,
in
the
pressure
of
arduous
avocations
,
under
grinding
penurious
apprehensions
,
at
rise
of
morn
,
at
dewy
eve
,
in
the
shadows
of
night
,
under
the
watchful
eye
of
one
whom
it
were
superfluous
to
call
Demon
---
combined
with
the
struggle
of
parental
Poverty
to
turn
it
,
when
completed
,
to
the
right
account
,
may
be
as
the
sprinkling
of
a
few
drops
of
sweet
water
on
my
funeral
pyre
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
no
more
.

Let
it
be
,
in
justice
,
merely
said
of
me
,
as
of
a
gallant
and
eminent
naval
Hero
,
with
whom
I
have
no
pretensions
to
cope

Much
affected
,
but
still
intensely
enjoying
himself
,
Mr
Micawber
folded
up
his
letter
,
and
handed
it
with
a
bow
to
my
aunt
,
as
something
she
might
like
to
keep
.

There
was
,
as
I
had
noticed
on
my
first
visit
long

,
an
iron
safe
in
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
key
was
in
it

<EOS>
A
hasty
suspicion
seemed
to
strike
Uriah
;
and
,
with
a
glance
at
Mr
Micawber
,
he
went
to
it
,
and
threw
the
doors
clanking
open
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
empty
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
are
the
books

<EOS>
"
he
cried
,
with
a
frightful
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Some
thief
has
stolen
the
books

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
tapped
himself
with
the
ruler
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
when
I
got
the
key
from
you
as
usual

a
little
earlier

opened
it
this
morning

Do
n't

Under
such

answered
Traddles
,
"
yes

<EOS>
What
was
my
astonishment
when
I
beheld
my
aunt
,
who
had
been
profoundly
quiet
and
attentive
,
make
a
dart
at
Uriah
Heep
,
and
seize
him
by
the
collar
with
both

said
my

he

returned
my

my

Whether
my
aunt
supposed
,
for
the
moment
,
that
he
kept
her
property
in
his
neck

kerchief
,
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
;
but
she
certainly
pulled
at
it
as
if
she
thought
so

<EOS>
I
hastened
to
put
myself
between
them
,
and
to
assure
her
that
we
would
all
take
care
that
he
should
make
the
utmost
restitution
of
everything
he
had
wrongly
got
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
and
a
few
moments
'
reflection
,
pacified
her
;
but
she
was
not
at
all
disconcerted
by
what
she
had
done
<EOS>
(
though
I
can
not
say
as
much
for
her
bonnet
)
and
resumed
her
seat
composedly
.
   
<EOS>
During
the
last
few
minutes
,
Mrs
Heep
had
been
clamouring
to
her
son
to
be
"
umble
"
;
and
had
been
going
down
on
her
knees
to
all
of
us
in
succession
,
and
making
the
wildest
promises
.
 
<EOS>
Her
son
sat
her
down
in
his
chair
;
and
,
standing
sulkily
by
her
,
holding
her
arm
with
his
hand
,
but
not
rudely
,
said
to
me
,
with
a
ferocious
look
:
   
"
What
do
you
want
done
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
must
be
done
,
"
said
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
Has
that
Copperfield
no
tongue
?
"
<EOS>
muttered
Uriah
,
"
I
would
do
a
good
deal
for
you
if
you
could
tell
me
,
without
lying
,
that
somebody
had
cut
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
Uriah
means
to
be
umble
!
"
cried
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mind
what
he
says
,
good
gentlemen
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
must
be
done
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
is
this
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
the
deed
of
relinquishment
,
that
we
have
heard
of
,
must
be
given
over
to
me
now
---
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Suppose
I
have
n't
got
it
,
"
he
interrupted
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
,
"
said
Traddles
;
"
therefore
,
you
know
,
we
wo
n't
suppose
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
I
can
not
help
avowing
that
this
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
I
really
did
justice
to
the
clear
head
,
and
the
plain
,
patient
,
practical
good
sense
,
of
my
old
schoolfellow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
you
must
prepare
to
disgorge
all
that
your
rapacity
has
become
possessed
of
,
and
to
make
restoration
to
the
last
farthing
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
partnership
books
and
papers
must
remain
in
our
possession
;
all
your
books
and
papers
;
all
money
accounts
and
securities
,
of
both
kinds
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
everything
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Must
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
,
"
said
Uriah
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
time
to
think
about
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
replied
Traddles
;
"
but
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
and
until
everything
is
done
to
our
satisfaction
,
we
shall
maintain
possession
of
these
things
;
and
beg
you
---
in
short
,
compel
you
---
to
keep
to
your
own
room
,
and
hold
no
communication
with
anyone
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
do
it
!
"
<EOS>
said
Uriah
,
with
an
oath
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Maidstone
jail
is
a
safer
place
of
detention
,
"
observed
Traddles
;
"
and
though
the
law
may
be
longer
in
righting
us
,
and
may
not
be
able
to
right
us
so
completely
as
you
can
,
there
is
no
doubt
of
its
punishing
YOU
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
me
,
you
know
that
quite
as
well
as
I
!
<EOS>
Copperfield
,
will
you
go
round
to
the
Guildhall
,
and
bring
a
couple
of
officers
?
"
   
<EOS>
Here
,
Mrs
Heep
broke
out
again
,
crying
on
her
knees
to
Agnes
to
interfere
in
their
behalf
,
exclaiming
that
he
was
very
humble
,
and
it
was
all
true
,
and
if
he
did
n't
do
what
we
wanted
,
she
would
,
and
much
more
to
the
same
purpose
;
being
half
frantic
with
fears
for
her
darling
.
 
<EOS>
To
inquire
what
he
might
have
done
,
if
he
had
had
any
boldness
,
would
be
like
inquiring
what
a
mongrel
cur
might
do
,
if
it
had
the
spirit
of
a
tiger
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
coward
,
from
head
to
foot
;
and
showed
his
dastardly
nature
through
his
sullenness
and
mortification
,
as
much
as
at
any
time
of
his
mean
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
<EOS>
he
growled
to
me
;
and
wiped
his
hot
face
with
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
hold
your
noise
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
Let
'em
have
that
deed
.
 
<EOS>
Go
and
fetch
it
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
help
her
,
Mr
Dick
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
if
you
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
Proud
of
his
commission
,
and
understanding
it
<EOS>
,
Mr
Dick
accompanied
her
as
a
shepherd
's
dog
might
accompany
a
sheep
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Mrs
Heep
gave
him
little
trouble
;
for
she
not
only
returned
with
the
deed
,
but
with
the
box
in
which
it
was
,
where
we
found
a
banker
's
book
and
some
other
papers
that
were
afterwards
serviceable
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
said
Traddles
,
when
this
was
brought
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr
Heep
,
you
can
retire
to
think
:
particularly
observing
,
if
you
please
,
that
I
declare
to
you
,
on
the
part
of
all
present
,
that
there
is
only
one
thing
to
be
done
;
that
it
is
what
I
have
explained
;
and
that
it
must
be
done
without
delay
.
"
   
<EOS>
Uriah
,
without
lifting
his
eyes
from
the
ground
,
shuffled
across
the
room
with
his
hand
to
his
chin
,
and
pausing
at
the
door
,
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
Copperfield
,
I
have
always
hated
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
've
always
been
an
upstart
,
and
you
've
always
been
against
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
I
think
I
told
you
once
before
,
"
said
I
,
<EOS>
"
it
is
you
who
have
been
,
in
your
greed
and
cunning
,
against
all
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
profitable
to
you
to
reflect
,
in
future
,
that
there
never
were
greed
and
cunning
in
the
world
yet
,
<EOS>
that
did
not
do
too
much
,
and
overreach
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
as
certain
as
death
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Or
as
certain
as
they
used
to
teach
at
school
(
the
same
school
where
I
picked
up
so
much
umbleness
)
,
from
nine
o'clock
to
eleven
,
that
labour
was
a
curse
;
and
from
eleven
o'clock
to
one
,
that
it
was
a
blessing
and
a
cheerfulness
,
and
a
dignity
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
all
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
with
a
sneer
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
preach
,
about
as
consistent
as
they
did
.
 
<EOS>
Wo
n't
umbleness
go
down
?
 
<EOS>
I
should
n't
have
got
round
<EOS>
my
gentleman
fellow
-
partner
without
it
<EOS>
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
---
Micawber
,
you
old
bully
,
I
'll
pay
YOU
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
supremely
defiant
of
him
and
his
extended
finger
,
and
making
a
great
deal
of
his
chest
until
he
had
slunk
out
at
the
door
,
then
addressed
himself
to
me
,
and
proffered
me
the
satisfaction
of
"
witnessing
the
re
-
establishment
of
mutual
confidence
between
himself
and
Mrs
Micawber
"
.
 
<EOS>
After
which
,
he
invited
the
company
generally
to
the
contemplation
of
that
affecting
spectacle
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
veil
that
has
long
been
interposed
between
Mrs
Micawber
and
myself
,
is
now
withdrawn
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
;
"
and
my
children
and
the
Author
of
their
Being
can
once
more
come
in
contact
on
equal
terms
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
we
were
all
very
grateful
to
him
,
and
all
desirous
to
show
that
we
were
,
as
well
as
the
hurry
and
disorder
of
our
spirits
would
permit
,
I
dare
say
we
should
all
have
gone
,
but
that
it
was
necessary
for
Agnes
to
return
to
her
father
,
as
yet
unable
to
bear
more
than
the
dawn
of
hope
;
and
for
someone
else
to
hold
Uriah
in
safe
keeping
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
Traddles
remained
for
the
latter
purpose
,
to
be
presently
relieved
by
Mr
Dick
;
and
Mr
Dick
,
my
aunt
,
and
I
,
went
home
with
Mr
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
parted
hurriedly
from
the
dear
girl
to
whom
I
owed
so
much
,
and
thought
from
what
she
had
been
saved
,
perhaps
,
that
morning
---
her
better
resolution
notwithstanding
---
I
felt
devoutly
thankful
for
the
miseries
of
my
younger
days
which
had
brought
me
to
the
knowledge
of
Mr
Micawber
.
   
<EOS>
His
house
was
not
far
off
;
and
as
the
street
door
opened
into
the
sitting
-
room
,
and
he
bolted
in
with
a
precipitation
quite
his
own
,
we
found
ourselves
at
once
in
the
bosom
of
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
exclaiming
,
"
Emma
!
<EOS>
my
life
!
<EOS>
"
rushed
into
Mrs
Micawber
's
arms
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
shrieked
,
and
folded
Mr
Micawber
in
her
embrace
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Micawber
,
nursing
the
unconscious
stranger
of
Mrs
Micawber
's
last
letter
to
me
,
was
sensibly
affected
.
 
<EOS>
The
stranger
leaped
.
 
<EOS>
The
twins
testified
their
joy
by
several
inconvenient
but
innocent
demonstrations
.
 
<EOS>
Master
Micawber
,
whose
disposition
appeared
to
have
been
soured
by
early
disappointment
,
and
whose
aspect
had
become
morose
,
yielded
to
his
better
feelings
,
and
blubbered
.
   
<EOS>
"
Emma
!
"
said
Mr
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
cloud
is
past
from
my
mind
.
<EOS>
Mutual
confidence
,
so
long
preserved
between
us
once
,
is
restored
,
to
know
no
further
interruption
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
welcome
poverty
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Mr
Micawber
,
shedding
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
Welcome
misery
,
welcome
houselessness
,
welcome
hunger
,
rags
,
tempest
,
and
beggary
!
<EOS>
Mutual
confidence
will
sustain
us
to
the
end
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
these
expressions
,
Mr
Micawber
placed
Mrs
Micawber
in
a
chair
,
and
embraced
the
family
all
round
;
welcoming
a
variety
of
bleak
prospects
,
which
appeared
,
to
the
best
of
my
judgement
,
to
be
anything
but
welcome
to
them
;
and
calling
upon
them
to
come
out
into
Canterbury
and
sing
a
chorus
,
as
nothing
else
was
left
for
their
support
.
   
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Micawber
having
,
in
the
strength
of
her
emotions
,
fainted
away
,
the
first
thing
to
be
done
,
even
before
the
chorus
could
be
considered
complete
,
was
to
recover
her
.
 
<EOS>
This
my
aunt
and
Mr
Micawber
did
;
and
then
my
aunt
was
introduced
,
and
Mrs
Micawber
recognized
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
said
the
poor
lady
,
giving
me
her
hand
,
"
but
I
am
not
strong
;
and
the
removal
of
the
late
misunderstanding
between
Mr
Micawber
and
myself
was
at
first
too
much
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
this
all
your
family
,
ma'am
?
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
are
no
more
at
present
,
"
returned
Mrs
Micawber
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
,
I
did
n't
mean
that
,
ma'am
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
are
all
these
yours
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
replied
Mr
Micawber
,
"
it
is
a
true
bill
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
And
that
eldest
young
gentleman
,
now
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
musing
,
"
what
has
he
been
brought
up
to
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
my
hope
when
I
came
here
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
to
have
got
Wilkins
into
the
Church
:
or
perhaps
I
shall
express
my
meaning
more
strictly
,
if
I
say
the
Choir
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
vacancy
for
a
tenor
in
the
venerable
Pile
for
which
this
city
is
so
justly
eminent
;
and
he
has
---
in
short
,
he
has
contracted
a
habit
of
singing
in
public
-
houses
,
rather
than
in
sacred
edifices
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
he
means
well
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
tenderly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
,
my
love
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Micawber
,
"
that
he
means
particularly
well
;
but
I
have
not
yet
found
that
he
carries
out
his
meaning
,
in
any
given
direction
whatsoever
.
"
   
<EOS>
Master
Micawber
's
moroseness
of
aspect
returned
upon
him
again
,
and
he
demanded
,
with
some
temper
,
what
he
was
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
Whether
he
had
been
born
a
carpenter
,
or
a
coach
-
painter
,
any
more
than
he
had
been
born
a
bird
?
 
<EOS>
Whether
he
could
go
into
the
next
street
,
and
open
a
chemist
's
shop
?
 
<EOS>
Whether
he
could
rush
to
the
next
assizes
,
and
proclaim
himself
a
lawyer
?
 
<EOS>
Whether
he
could
come
out
by
force
at
the
opera
,
and
succeed
by
violence
?
 
<EOS>
Whether
he
could
do
anything
,
without
being
brought
up
to
something
?
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
mused
a
little
while
,
and
then
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
I
wonder
you
have
never
turned
your
thoughts
to
emigration
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
returned
Mr
Micawber
,
"
it
was
the
dream
of
my
youth
,
and
the
fallacious
aspiration
of
my
riper
years
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
am
thoroughly
persuaded
,
by
the
by
,
that
he
had
never
thought
of
it
in
his
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
?
"
said
my
aunt
,
with
a
glance
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
a
thing
it
would
be
for
yourselves
and
your
family
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
,
if
you
were
to
emigrate
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Capital
,
madam
,
capital
,
"
urged
Mr
Micawber
,
gloomily
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
principal
,
I
may
say
the
only
difficulty
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
assented
his
wife
.
   
<EOS>
"
Capital
?
"
cried
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
doing
us
a
great
service
---
have
done
us
a
great
service
,
I
may
say
,
for
surely
much
will
come
out
of
the
fire
---
and
what
could
we
do
for
you
,
that
would
be
half
so
good
as
to
find
the
capital
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
receive
it
as
a
gift
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
full
of
fire
and
animation
,
"
but
if
a
sufficient
sum
could
be
advanced
,
say
at
five
per
cent
interest
,
per
annum
,
upon
my
personal
liability
---
<EOS>
say
my
notes
of
hand
,
at
twelve
,
eighteen
,
and
twenty
-
four
months
,
respectively
,
to
allow
time
for
something
to
turn
up
---
"
   
"
Could
be
?
 
<EOS>
Can
be
and
shall
be
,
on
your
own
terms
,
"
returned
my
aunt
,
"
if
you
say
the
word
.
 
<EOS>
Think
of
this
now
,
both
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
Here
are
some
people
David
knows
,
going
out
to
Australia
shortly
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
decide
to
go
,
why
should
n't
you
go
in
the
same
ship
?
 
<EOS>
You
may
help
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
Think
of
this
now
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
Take
your
time
,
and
weigh
it
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
but
one
question
,
my
dear
ma'am
,
I
could
wish
to
ask
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
climate
,
I
believe
,
is
healthy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Finest
in
the
world
!
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Just
so
,
"
returned
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
my
question
arises
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
are
the
circumstances
of
the
country
such
,
that
a
man
of
Mr
Micawber
's
abilities
would
have
a
fair
chance
of
rising
in
the
social
scale
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
,
at
present
,
might
he
aspire
to
be
Governor
,
or
anything
of
that
sort
;
but
would
there
be
a
reasonable
opening
for
his
talents
to
develop
themselves
---
that
would
be
amply
sufficient
---
and
find
their
own
expansion
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
better
opening
anywhere
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
for
a
man
who
conducts
himself
well
,
and
is
industrious
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
a
man
who
conducts
himself
well
,
"
repeated
Mrs
Micawber
,
with
her
clearest
business
manner
,
"
and
is
industrious
.
 
<EOS>
Precisely
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
evident
to
me
that
Australia
is
the
legitimate
sphere
of
action
for
Mr
Micawber
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
entertain
the
conviction
,
my
dear
madam
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
that
it
is
,
under
existing
circumstances
,
the
land
,
the
only
land
,
for
myself
and
family
;
<EOS>
and
that
something
of
an
extraordinary
nature
will
turn
up
on
that
shore
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
no
distance
---
comparatively
speaking
;
and
though
consideration
is
due
to
the
kindness
of
your
proposal
,
I
assure
you
that
is
a
mere
matter
of
form
.
"
   
<EOS>
Shall
I
ever
forget
how
,
in
a
moment
,
he
was
the
most
sanguine
of
men
,
looking
on
to
fortune
;
or
how
Mrs
Micawber
presently
discoursed
about
the
habits
of
the
kangaroo
!
<EOS>
Shall
I
ever
recall
that
street
of
Canterbury
on
a
market
-
day
,
without
recalling
him
,
as
he
walked
back
with
us
;
expressing
,
in
the
hardy
roving
manner
he
assumed
,
the
unsettled
habits
of
a
temporary
sojourner
in
the
land
;
and
looking
at
the
bullocks
,
as
they
came
by
,
with
the
eye
of
an
Australian
farmer
!

Chapter

<EOS>
Another
retrospect
 
<EOS>
I
must
pause
yet
once
again
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
my
child
-
wife
,
there
is
a
figure
in
the
moving
crowd
before
my
memory
,
quiet
and
still
,
saying
in
its
innocent
love
and
childish
beauty
,
Stop
to
think
of
me
---
turn
to
look
upon
the
Little
Blossom
,
as
it
flutters
to
the
ground
!
   
<EOS>
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
All
else
grows
dim
,
and
fades
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
again
with
Dora
,
in
our
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
long
she
has
been
ill
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
used
to
it
in
feeling
,
that
I
can
not
count
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
really
long
,
in
weeks
or
months
;
but
,
in
my
usage
and
experience
,
it
is
a
weary
,
weary
while
.
   
<EOS>
They
have
left
off
telling
me
to
"
wait
a
few
days
more
"
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
begun
to
fear
,
remotely
,
that
the
day
may
never
shine
,
when
I
shall
see
my
child
-
wife
running
in
the
sunlight
with
her
old
friend
Jip
.
   
<EOS>
He
is
,
as
it
were
suddenly
,
grown
very
old
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
he
misses
in
his
mistress
,
something
that
enlivened
him
and
made
him
younger
;
but
he
mopes
,
and
his
sight
is
weak
,
and
his
limbs
are
feeble
,
and
my
aunt
is
sorry
that
he
objects
to
her
no
more
,
but
creeps
near
her
as
he
lies
on
Dora
's
bed
<EOS>
---
she
sitting
at
the
bedside
---
and
mildly
licks
her
hand
.
   
<EOS>
Dora
lies
smiling
on
us
,
and
is
beautiful
,
and
utters
no
hasty
or
complaining
word
.
 
<EOS>
She
says
that
we
are
very
good
to
her
;
that
her
dear
old
careful
boy
is
tiring
himself
out
,
she
knows
;
that
my
aunt
has
no
sleep
,
yet
is
always
wakeful
,
active
,
and
kind
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
the
little
bird
-
like
ladies
come
to
see
her
;
and
then
we
talk
about
our
wedding
-
day
,
and
all
that
happy
time
.
   
<EOS>
What
a
strange
rest
and
pause
in
my
life
there
seems
to
be
---
and
in
all
life
,
within
doors
and
without
---
when
I
sit
in
the
quiet
,
shaded
,
orderly
room
,
with
the
blue
eyes
of
my
child
-
wife
turned
towards
me
,
and
her
little
fingers
twining
round
my
hand
!
<EOS>
Many
and
many
an
hour
I
sit
thus
;
but
,
of
all
those
times
,
three
times
come
the
freshest
on
my
mind
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
morning
;
and
Dora
,
made
so
trim
by
my
aunt
's
hands
,
shows
me
how
her
pretty
hair
will
curl
upon
the
pillow
yet
,
an
how
long
and
bright
it
is
,
and
how
she
likes
to
have
it
loosely
gathered
in
that
net
she
wears
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
that
I
am
vain
of
it
,
now
,
you
mocking
boy
,
"
she
says
,
when
I
smile
;
"
but
because
you
used
to
say
you
thought
it
so
beautiful
;
and
because
,
when
I
first
began
to
think
about
you
,
I
used
to
peep
in
the
glass
,
and
wonder
whether
you
would
like
very
much
to
have
a
lock
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
what
a
foolish
fellow
you
were
,
Doady
,
when
I
gave
you
one
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
was
on
the
day
when
you
were
painting
the
flowers
I
had
given
you
,
Dora
,
and
when
I
told
you
how
much
in
love
I
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
but
I
did
n't
like
to
tell
you
,
"
says
Dora
,
"
then
,
how
I
had
cried
over
them
,
because
I
believed
you
really
liked
me
!
<EOS>
When
I
can
run
about
again
as
I
used
to
do
,
Doady
,
let
us
go
and
see
those
places
where
we
were
such
a
silly
couple
,
shall
we
?
 
<EOS>
And
take
some
of
the
old
walks
?
 
<EOS>
And
not
forget
poor
papa
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
we
will
,
and
have
some
happy
days
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
must
make
haste
to
get
well
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
shall
soon
do
that
!
<EOS>
I
am
so
much
better
,
you
do
n't
know
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
is
evening
;
and
I
sit
in
the
same
chair
,
by
the
same
bed
,
with
the
same
face
turned
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
been
silent
,
and
there
is
a
smile
upon
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
ceased
to
carry
my
light
burden
up
and
down
stairs
now
.
 
<EOS>
She
lies
here
all
the
day
.
   
<EOS>
"
Doady
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Dora
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
think
what
I
am
going
to
say
,
unreasonable
,
after
what
you
told
me
,
such
a
little
while
ago
,
of
Mr
Wickfield
's
not
being
well
?
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
Very
much
I
want
to
see
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
write
to
her
,
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Directly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
good
,
kind
boy
!
<EOS>
Doady
,
take
me
on
your
arm
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
my
dear
,
it
's
not
a
whim
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
a
foolish
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
,
very
much
indeed
,
to
see
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
certain
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
to
tell
her
so
,
and
she
is
sure
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
lonely
when
you
go
downstairs
,
now
?
"
<EOS>
Dora
whispers
,
with
her
arm
about
my
neck
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
be
otherwise
,
my
own
love
,
when
I
see
your
empty
chair
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
empty
chair
!
"
<EOS>
She
clings
to
me
for
a
little
while
,
in
silence
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
really
miss
me
,
Doady
?
"
looking
up
,
and
brightly
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
Even
poor
,
giddy
,
stupid
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
heart
,
who
is
there
upon
earth
that
I
could
miss
so
much
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
husband
!
<EOS>
I
am
so
glad
,
yet
so
sorry
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
creeping
closer
to
me
,
and
folding
me
in
both
her
arms
.
 
<EOS>
She
laughs
and
sobs
,
and
then
is
quiet
,
and
quite
happy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
!
"
<EOS>
she
says
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
give
Agnes
my
dear
love
,
and
tell
her
that
I
want
very
,
very
,
much
to
see
her
;
and
I
have
nothing
left
to
wish
for
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Except
to
get
well
again
,
Dora
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Doady
!
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
think
---
<EOS>
you
know
I
always
was
a
silly
little
thing
!
<EOS>
---
that
that
will
never
be
!

<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
so
,
Dora
!
<EOS>
Dearest
love
,
do
n't
think
so
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
,
if
I
can
help
it
,
Doady
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
very
happy
;
though
my
dear
boy
is
so
lonely
by
himself
,
before
his
child
-
wife
's
empty
chair
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
is
night
;
and
I
am
with
her
still
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
has
arrived
;
has
been
among
us
for
a
whole
day
and
an
evening
.
 
<EOS>
She
,
my
aunt
,
and
I
,
have
sat
with
Dora
since
the
morning
,
all
together
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
not
talked
much
,
but
Dora
has
been
perfectly
contented
and
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
now
alone
.
   
<EOS>
Do
I
know
,
now
,
that
my
child
-
wife
will
soon
leave
me
?
 
<EOS>
They
have
told
me
so
;
they
have
told
me
nothing
new
to
my
thoughts
---
but
I
am
far
from
sure
that
I
have
taken
that
truth
to
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
master
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
withdrawn
by
myself
,
many
times
today
,
to
weep
.
<EOS>
I
have
remembered
Who
wept
for
a
parting
between
the
living
and
the
dead
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
bethought
me
of
all
that
gracious
and
compassionate
history
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
tried
to
resign
myself
,
and
to
console
myself
;
and
that
,
I
hope
,
I
may
have
done
imperfectly
;
but
what
I
can
not
firmly
settle
in
my
mind
is
,
that
the
end
will
absolutely
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
hold
her
hand
in
mine
<EOS>
,
I
hold
her
heart
in
mine
,
I
see
her
love
for
me
,
alive
in
all
its
strength
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
shut
out
a
pale
lingering
shadow
of
belief
that
she
will
be
spared
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
speak
to
you
,
Doady
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
say
something
I
have
often
thought
of
saying
,
lately
.
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
mind
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
a
gentle
look
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mind
,
my
darling
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Because
I
do
n't
know
what
you
will
think
,
or
what
you
may
have
thought
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
have
often
thought
the
same
.
<EOS>
Doady
,
dear
,
I
am
afraid
I
was
too
young
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
lay
my
face
upon
the
pillow
by
her
,
and
she
looks
into
my
eyes
,
and
speaks
very
softly
.
 
<EOS>
Gradually
,
as
she
goes
on
,
I
feel
,
with
a
stricken
heart
,
that
she
is
speaking
of
herself
as
past
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
dear
,
I
was
too
young
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
in
years
only
,
but
in
experience
,
and
thoughts
,
and
everything
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
such
a
silly
little
creature
!
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
it
would
have
been
better
,
if
we
had
only
loved
each
other
as
a
boy
and
girl
,
and
forgotten
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
begun
to
think
I
was
not
fit
to
be
a
wife
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
try
to
stay
my
tears
,
and
to
reply
,
"
Oh
,
Dora
,
love
,
as
fit
as
I
to
be
a
husband
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
with
the
old
shake
of
her
curls
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
!
<EOS>
But
if
I
had
been
more
fit
to
be
married
I
might
have
made
you
more
so
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
you
are
very
clever
,
and
I
never
was
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
been
very
happy
,
my
sweet
Dora
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
very
happy
,
very
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
years
went
on
,
my
dear
boy
would

wearied
of
his
child

wife

<EOS>
She
would
have
been
less
and
less
a
companion
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
been
more
and
more
sensible
of
what
was
wanting
in
his
home
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
n't
have
improved
.

It
is
better

it
is

Oh

Dora

dearest

dearest

do
not
speak
to
me
so

Every
word
seems
a
reproach

"
No

not
a

she
answers
,
kissing
me
.

"
Oh
,
my
dear

you
never
deserved
it
,
and
I
loved
you
far
too
well
to
say
a
reproachful
word
to
you
,
in
earnest
---
it
was
all
the
merit
I
had
,
except
being
pretty

you
thought
me
so

it
lonely

Very

n't

In

how
my
poor
boy
cries

Hush

hush

Now

make
me
one
promise

<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
Agnes

<EOS>
When
you
go
downstairs
,
tell
Agnes
so

and
send
her
up
to
me
;
and
while
I
speak
to
her
,
let
no
one
come
---
not
even
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
Agnes
by
herself
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
Agnes
,
quite
alone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
promise
that
she
shall
,
immediately
;
but
I
can
not
leave
her
,
for
my
grief
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
said
that
it
was
better
as
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
she
whispers
,
as
she
holds
me
in
her
arms
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Doady
,
after
more
years
,
you
never
could
have
loved
your
child
-
wife
better
than
you
do
;
and
,
after
more
years
,
she
would
so
have
tried
and
disappointed
you
,
that
you
might
not
have
been
able
to
love
her
half
so
well
!
<EOS>
I
know
I
was
too
young
and
foolish
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
much
better
as
it
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
Agnes
is
downstairs
,
when
I
go
into
the
parlour
;
and
I
give
her
the
message
.
 
<EOS>
She
disappears
,
leaving
me
alone
with
Jip
.
   
<EOS>
His
Chinese
house
is
by
the
fire
;
and
he
lies
within
it
,
on
his
bed
of
flannel
,
querulously
trying
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
The
bright
moon
is
high
and
clear
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
look
out
on
the
night
,
my
tears
fall
fast
,
and
my
undisciplined
heart
is
chastened
heavily
---
heavily
.
   
<EOS>
I
sit
down
by
the
fire
,
thinking
with
a
blind
remorse
of
all
those
secret
feelings
I
have
nourished
since
my
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
of
every
little
trifle
between
me
and
Dora
,
and
feel
the
truth
,
that
trifles
make
the
sum
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
Ever
rising
from
the
sea
of
my
remembrance
,
is
the
image
of
the
dear
child
as
I
knew
her
first
,
graced
by
my
young
love
,
and
by
her
own
,
with
every
fascination
wherein
such
love
is
rich
.
 
<EOS>
Would
it
,
indeed
,
have
been
better
if
we
had
loved
each
other
as
a
boy
and
a
girl
,
and
forgotten
it
?
<EOS>
Undisciplined
heart
,
reply
!
   
<EOS>
How
the
time
wears
,
I
know
not
;
until
I
am
recalled
by
my
child
-
wife
's
old
companion
.
 
<EOS>
More
restless
than
he
was
,
he
crawls
out
of
his
house
,
and
looks
at
me
,
and
wanders
to
the
door
,
and
whines
to
go
upstairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
tonight
,
Jip
!
<EOS>
Not
tonight
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
comes
very
slowly
back
to
me
,
licks
my
hand
,
and
lifts
his
dim
eyes
to
my
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Jip
!
<EOS>
It
may
be
,
never
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
lies
down
at
my
feet
,
stretches
himself
out
as
if
to
sleep
,
and
with
a
plaintive
cry
,
is
dead
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Agnes
!
<EOS>
Look
,
look
,
here
!
"
   
---
<EOS>
That
face
,
so
full
of
pity
,
and
of
grief
,
that
rain
of
tears
,
that
awful
mute
appeal
to
me
,
that
solemn
hand
upraised
towards
Heaven
!
   
<EOS>
"
Agnes
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
is
over
.
 
<EOS>
Darkness
comes
before
my
eyes
;
and
,
for
a
time
,
all
things
are
blotted
out
of
my
remembrance

Chapter

<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
's
transactions
 
<EOS>
This
is
not
the
time
at
which
I
am
to
enter
on
the
state
of
my
mind
beneath
its
load
of
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
to
think
that
the
Future
was
walled
up
before
me
,
that
the
energy
and
action
of
my
life
were
at
an
end
,
that
I
never
could
find
any
refuge
but
in
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
to
think
so
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
but
not
in
the
first
shock
of
my
grief
.
<EOS>
It
slowly
grew
to
that
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
events
I
go
on
to
relate
,
had
not
thickened
around
me
,
in
the
beginning
to
confuse
,
and
in
the
end
to
augment
,
my
affliction
,
it
is
possible
(
though
I
think
not
probable
)
,
that
I
might
have
fallen
at
once
into
this
condition
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
an
interval
occurred
before
I
fully
knew
my
own
distress
;
an
interval
,
in
which
I
even
supposed
that
its
sharpest
pangs
were
past
;
and
when
my
mind
could
soothe
itself
by
resting
on
all
that
was
most
innocent
and
beautiful
,
in
the
tender
story
that
was
closed
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
When
it
was
first
proposed
that
I
should
go
abroad
,
or
how
it
came
to
be
agreed
among
us
that
I
was
to
seek
the
restoration
of
my
peace
in
change
and
travel
,
I
do
not
,
even
now
,
distinctly
know
.
<EOS>
The
spirit
of
Agnes
so
pervaded
all
we
thought
,
and
said
,
and
did
,
in
that
time
of
sorrow
,
that
I
assume
I
may
refer
the
project
to
her
influence
.
 
<EOS>
But
her
influence
was
so
quiet
that
I
know
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
,
indeed
,
I
began
to
think
that
in
my
old
association
of
her
with
the
stained
-
glass
window
in
the
church
,
a
prophetic
foreshadowing
of
what
she
would
be
to
me
,
in
the
calamity
that
was
to
happen
in
the
fullness
of
time
,
had
found
a
way
into
my
mind
.
<EOS>
In
all
that
sorrow
,
from
the
moment
,
never
to
be
forgotten
,
when
she
stood
before
me
with
her
upraised
hand
,
she
was
like
a
sacred
presence
in
my
lonely
house
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Angel
of
Death
alighted
there
,
my
child
-
wife
fell
asleep
---
they
told
me
so
when
I
could
bear
to
hear
it
---
on
her
bosom
,
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
From
my
swoon
,
I
first
awoke
to
a
consciousness
of
her
compassionate
tears
,
her
words
of
hope
and
peace
,
her
gentle
face
bending
down
as
from
a
purer
region
nearer
Heaven
,
over
my
undisciplined
heart
,
and
softening
its
pain
.
   
<EOS>
Let
me
go
on
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
to
go
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
That
seemed
to
have
been
determined
among
us
from
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
The
ground
now
covering
all
that
could
perish
of
my
departed
wife
<EOS>
,
I
waited
only
for
what
Mr
Micawber
called
the
"
final
pulverization
of
Heep
"
;
and
for
the
departure
of
the
emigrants
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
request
of
Traddles
,
most
affectionate
and
devoted
of
friends
in
my
trouble
,
we
returned
to
Canterbury
:
<EOS>
I
mean
my
aunt
,
Agnes
,
and
I.
 
We
proceeded
by
appointment
straight
to
Mr
Micawber
's
house
;
<EOS>
where
,
and
at
Mr
Wickfield
's
,
my
friend
had
been
labouring
ever
since
our
explosive
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
When
poor
Mrs
Micawber
saw
me
come
in
,
in
my
black
clothes
,
she
was
sensibly
affected
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
deal
of
good
in
Mrs
Micawber
's
heart
,
which
had
not
been
dunned
out
of
it
in
all
those
many
years
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
was
my
aunt
's
first
salutation
after
we
were
seated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
have
you
thought
about
that
emigration
proposal
of
mine
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
madam
,
"
returned
Mr
Micawber
,
"
<EOS>
perhaps
I
can
not
better
express
the
conclusion
at
which
Mrs
Micawber
,
your
humble
servant
,
and
I
may
add
our
children
,
have
jointly
and
severally
arrived
,
than
by
borrowing
the
language
of
an
illustrious
poet
,
to
reply
that
our
Boat
is
on
the
shore
,
and
our
Bark
is
on
the
sea
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
augur
all
sort
of
good
from
your
sensible
decision
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
you
do
us
a
great
deal
of
honour
,
"
he
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
referred
to
a
memorandum
.
 
<EOS>
"
With
respect
to
the
pecuniary
assistance
enabling
us
to
launch
our
frail
canoe
on
the
ocean
of
enterprise
,
I
have
reconsidered
that
important
business
-
point
;
and
would
beg
to
propose
my
notes
of
hand
---
drawn
,
it
is
needless
to
stipulate
,
on
stamps
of
the
amounts
respectively
required
by
the
various
Acts
of
Parliament
applying
to
such
securities
---
at
eighteen
,
twenty
-
four
,
and
thirty
months
.
 
<EOS>
The
proposition
I
originally
submitted
,
was
twelve
,
eighteen
,
and
twenty
-
four
;
but
I
am
apprehensive
that
such
an
arrangement
might
not
allow
sufficient
time
for
the
requisite
amount
of
---
Something
---
to
turn
up
.
 
<EOS>
We
might
not
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
looking
round
the
room
as
if
it
represented
several
hundred
acres
of
highly
cultivated
land
,
"
on
the
first
responsibility
becoming
due
,
have
been
successful
in
our
harvest
,
or
we
might
not
have
got
our
harvest
in
.
 
<EOS>
Labour
,
I
believe
,
is
sometimes
difficult
to
obtain
in
that
portion
of
our
colonial
possessions
where
it
will
be
our
lot
to
combat
with
the
teeming
soil
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Arrange
it
in
any
way
you
please
,
sir
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
he
replied
,
"
Mrs
Micawber
and
myself
are
deeply
sensible
of
the
very
considerate
kindness
of
our
friends
and
patrons
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
wish
is
,
to
be
perfectly
business
-
like
,
and
perfectly
punctual
.
<EOS>
Turning
over
,
as
we
are
about
to
turn
over
,
an
entirely
new
leaf
;
and
falling
back
,
as
we
are
now
in
the
act
of
falling
back
,
for
a
Spring
of
no
common
magnitude
;
it
is
important
to
my
sense
of
self
-
respect
,
besides
being
an
example
to
my
son
,
that
these
arrangements
should
be
concluded
as
between
man
and
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
Mr
Micawber
attached
any
meaning
to
this
last
phrase
;
I
do
n't
know
that
anybody
ever
does
,
or
did
;
but
he
appeared
to
relish
it
uncommonly
,
and
repeated
,
with
an
impressive
cough
,
"
as
between
man
and
man
"
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
propose
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
Bills
---
a
convenience
to
the
mercantile
world
,
for
which
,
I
believe
,
we
are
originally
indebted
to
the
Jews
,
who
appear
to
me
to
have
had
a
devilish
deal
too
much
to
do
with
them
ever
since
---
because
they
are
negotiable
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
a
Bond
,
or
any
other
description
of
security
,
would
be
preferred
,
I
should
be
happy
to
execute
any
such
instrument

<EOS>
As
between

<EOS>
MY
aunt
observed
,
that
in
a
case
where
both
parties
were
willing
to
agree
to
anything
,
she
took
it
for
granted
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
settling
this
point
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
was
of
her
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
reference
to
our
domestic
preparations

madam

said
Mr
Micawber
,
with
some
pride
,
"
for
meeting
the
destiny
to
which
we
are
now
understood
to
be
self
-
devoted
<EOS>
,
I
beg
to
report
them
.
 
<EOS>
My
eldest
daughter
attends
at
five
every
morning
in
a
neighbouring
establishment
,
to
acquire
the
process
<EOS>
---
if
process
it
may
be
called
---
of
milking
cows
.
 
<EOS>
My
younger
children
are
instructed
to
observe
,
as
closely
as
circumstances
will
permit
,
the
habits
of
the
pigs
and
poultry
maintained
in
the
poorer
parts
of
this
city
:
<EOS>
a
pursuit
from
which
they
have
,
on
two
occasions
,
been
brought
home
,
within
an
inch
of
being
run
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
myself
directed
some
attention
,
during
the
past
week
,
to
the
art
of
baking
;
and
my
son
Wilkins
has
issued
forth
with
a
walking
-
stick
and
driven
cattle
,
when
permitted
,
by
the
rugged
hirelings
who
had
them
in
charge
,
to
render
any
voluntary
service
in
that
direction
---
which
I
regret
to
say
,
for
the
credit
of
our
nature
,
was
not
often
;
he
being
generally
warned
,
with
imprecations
,
to
desist
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
very
right
indeed
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
encouragingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Micawber

been
busy

too

have
no

<EOS>
My
dear
madam

"
returned
Mrs
Micawber
,
with
her
business
-
like
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
free
to
confess
that
I
have
not
been
actively
engaged
in
pursuits
immediately
connected
with
cultivation

with
stock
,
though
well
aware
that
both
will
claim
my
attention
on
a
foreign
shore

<EOS>
Such
opportunities
as
I
have
been
enabled
to
alienate
from
my
domestic
duties
,
I
have
devoted
to
corresponding
at
some
length

my
family

For
I
own
<EOS>
it
seems
to
me

dear
Mr
Copperfield

said
Mrs
Micawber
,
who
always
fell
back
on
me
,
I
suppose
from
old
habit
,
to
whomsoever
else
she
might
address
her
discourse
at
starting
,
"
that
the
time
is
come
when
the
past
should
be
buried
in
oblivion
;
when
my
family
should
take
Mr
Micawber
by
the
hand
,
and
Mr
Micawber
should
take
my
family
by
the
hand
;
when
the
lion
should
lie
down
with
the
lamb
,
and
my
family
be
on
terms
with
Mr
Micawber
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
said
I
thought
so
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
,
at
least
,
is
the
light
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
pursued
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
in
which
I
view
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
lived
at
home
with
my
papa
and
mama
,
my
papa
was
accustomed
to
ask
,
when
any
point
was
under
discussion
in
our
limited
circle
,
"
In
what
light
does
my
Emma
view
the
subject
?
<EOS>
"
That
my
papa
was
too
partial
,
I
know
;
still
,
on
such
a
point
as
the
frigid
coldness
which
has
ever
subsisted
between
Mr
Micawber
and
my
family
,
I
necessarily
have
formed
an
opinion
,
delusive
though
it
may
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
you
have
,
ma'am
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Precisely
so
,
"
assented
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
may
be
wrong
in
my
conclusions
;
it
is
very
likely
that
I
am
,
but
my
individual
impression
is
,
that
the
gulf
between
my
family
and
Mr
Micawber
may
be
traced
to
an
apprehension
,
on
the
part
of
my
family
,
that
Mr
Micawber
would
require
pecuniary
accommodation
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
thinking
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
with
an
air
of
deep
sagacity
,
"
that
there
are
members
of
my
family
who
have
been
apprehensive
that
Mr
Micawber
would
solicit
them
for
their
names
.
 
<EOS>
---
I
do
not
mean
to
be
conferred
in
Baptism
upon
our
children
,
but
to
be
inscribed
on
Bills
of
Exchange
,
and
negotiated
in
the
Money
Market
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
look
of
penetration
with
which
Mrs
Micawber
announced
this
discovery
,
as
if
no
one
had
ever
thought
of
it
before
,
seemed
rather
to
astonish
my
aunt
;
who
abruptly
replied
,
"
Well
,
ma'am
,
upon
the
whole
,
I
should
n't
wonder
if
you
were
right
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Micawber
being
now
on
the
eve
of
casting
off
the
pecuniary
shackles
that
have
so
long
enthralled
him
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
and
of
commencing
a
new
career
in
a
country
where
there
is
sufficient
range
for
his
abilities
,
---
which
,
in
my
opinion
,
is
exceedingly
important
;
Mr
Micawber
's
abilities
peculiarly
requiring
space
,
---
it
seems
to
me
that
my
family
should
signalize
the
occasion
by
coming
forward
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
could
wish
to
see
,
would
be
a
meeting
between
Mr
Micawber
and
my
family
at
a
festive
entertainment
,
to
be
given
at
my
family
's
expense
;
where
Mr
Micawber
's
health
and
prosperity
being
proposed
,
by
some
leading
member
of
my
family
,
Mr
Micawber
might
have
an
opportunity
of
developing
his
views
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
with
some
heat
,
"
it
may
be
better
for
me
to
state
distinctly
,
at
once
,
that
if
I
were
to
develop
my
views
to
that
assembled
group
,
they
would
possibly
be
found
of
an
offensive
nature
:
my
impression
being
that
your
family
are
,
in
the
aggregate
,
impertinent
Snobs
;
and
,
in
detail
,
unmitigated
Ruffians
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Micawber
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
shaking
her
head
,
"
no
!
<EOS>
You
have
never
understood
them
,
and
they
have
never
understood
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
coughed
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
have
never
understood
you
,
Micawber
,
"
said
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
may
be
incapable
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
so
,
that
is
their
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
pity
their
misfortune
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
extremely
sorry
,
my
dear
Emma
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
relenting
,
"
to
have
been
betrayed
into
any
expressions
that
might
,
even
remotely
,
have
the
appearance
of
being
strong
expressions
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
would
say
is
,
that
I
can
go
abroad
without
your
family
coming
forward
to
favour
me
,
---
in
short
,
with
a
parting
Shove
of
their
cold
shoulders
;
and
that
,
upon
the
whole
,
I
would
rather
leave
England
with
such
impetus
as
I
possess
,
than
derive
any
acceleration
of
it
from
that
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
my
dear
,
if
they
should
condescend
to
reply
to
your
communications
---
which
our
joint
experience
renders
most
improbable
<EOS>
---
far
be
it
from
me
to
be
a
barrier
to
your
wishes
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
matter
being
thus
amicably
settled
,
Mr
Micawber
gave
Mrs
Micawber
his
arm
,
and
glancing
at
the
heap
of
books
and
papers
lying
before
Traddles
on
the
table
,
said
they
would
leave
us
to
ourselves
;
which
they
ceremoniously
did
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Copperfield
,
"
said
Traddles
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
when
they
were
gone
,
and
looking
at
me
with
an
affection
that
made
his
eyes
red
,
and
his
hair
all
kinds
of
shapes
,
"
I
do
n't
make
any
excuse
for
troubling
you
with
business
,
because
I
know
you
are
deeply
interested
in
it
,
and
it
may
divert
your
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
boy
,
I
hope
you
are
not
worn
out
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
myself
,
"
said
I
,
after
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
more
cause
to
think
of
my
aunt
than
of
anyone
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
how
much
she
has
done
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
surely
,
"
answered
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
can
forget
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
even
that
is
not
all
,
"
said
I.
 
"
During
the
last
fortnight
,
some
new
trouble
has
vexed
her
;
and
she
has
been
in
and
out
of
London
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
Several
times
she
has
gone
out
early
,
and
been
absent
until
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Last
night
,
Traddles
,
with
this
journey
before
her
,
it
was
almost
midnight
before
she
came
home
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
what
her
consideration
for
others
is
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
not
tell
me
what
has
happened
to
distress
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
very
pale
,
and
with
deep
lines
in
her
face
,
sat
immovable
until
I
had
finished
;
when
some
stray
tears
found
their
way
to
her
cheeks
,
and
she
put
her
hand
on
mine
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
nothing
,
Trot
;
it
's
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
There
will
be
no
more
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
shall
know
by
and
by
.
 
<EOS>
Now
Agnes
,
my
dear
,
let
us
attend
to
these
affairs
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
do
Mr
Micawber
the
justice
to
say
,
"
Traddles
began
,
"
that
although
he
would
appear
not
to
have
worked
to
any
good
account
for
himself
,
he
is
a
most
untiring
man
when
he
works
for
other
people
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
such
a
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
always
goes
on
in
the
same
way
,
he
must
be
,
virtually
,
about
two
hundred
years
old
,
at
present
.
<EOS>
The
heat
into
which
he
has
been
continually
putting
himself
;
and
the
distracted
and
impetuous
manner
in
which
he
has
been
diving
,
day
and
night
,
among
papers
and
books
;
to
say
nothing
of
the
immense
number
of
letters
he
has
written
me
between
this
house
and
Mr
Wickfield
's
,
and
often
across
the
table
when
he
has
been
sitting
opposite
,
and
might
much
more
easily
have
spoken
;
is
quite
extraordinary
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Letters
!
"
cried
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
he
dreams
in
letters
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
Mr
Dick
,
too
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
has
been
doing
wonders
!
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
was
released
from
overlooking
Uriah
Heep
,
whom
he
kept
in
such
charge
as
I
never
saw
exceeded
,
he
began
to
devote
himself
to
Mr
Wickfield
.
 
<EOS>
And
really
his
anxiety
to
be
of
use
in
the
investigations
we
have
been
making
,
and
his
real
usefulness
in
extracting
,
and
copying
,
and
fetching
,
and
carrying
,
have
been
quite
stimulating
to
us
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dick
is
a
very
remarkable
man
,
"
exclaimed
my
aunt
;
"
and
I
always
said
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
Trot
,
you
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
happy
to
say
,
Miss
Wickfield
,
"
pursued
Traddles
,
at
once
with
great
delicacy
and
with
great
earnestness
,
"
that
in
your
absence
Mr
Wickfield
has
considerably
improved
.
 
<EOS>
Relieved
of
the
incubus
that
had
fastened
upon
him
for
so
long
a
time
,
and
of
the
dreadful
apprehensions
under
which
he
had
lived
<EOS>
,
he
is
hardly
the
same
person
.
 
<EOS>
At
times
,
even
his
impaired
power
of
concentrating
his
memory
and
attention
on
particular
points
of
business
,
has
recovered
itself
very
much
;
and
he
has
been
able
to
assist
us
in
making
some
things
clear
,
that
we
should
have
found
very
difficult
indeed
,
if
not
hopeless
,
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
I
have
to
do
is
to
come
to
results
;
which
are
short
enough
;
not
to
gossip
on
all
the
hopeful
circumstances
I
have
observed
,
or
I
shall
never
have
done
.
"
<EOS>
His
natural
manner
and
agreeable
simplicity
made
it
transparent
that
he
said
this
to
put
us
in
good
heart
,
and
to
enable
Agnes
to
hear
her
father
mentioned
with
greater
confidence
;
but
it
was
not
the
less
pleasant
for
that
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
let
me
see
,
"
said
Traddles
,
looking
among
the
papers
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
Having
counted
our
funds
,
and
reduced
to
order
a
great
mass
of
unintentional
confusion
in
the
first
place
,
and
of
wilful
confusion
and
falsification
in
the
second
,
we
take
it
to
be
clear
that
Mr
Wickfield
might
now
wind
up
his
business
,
and
his
agency
-
trust
,
and
exhibit
no
deficiency
or
defalcation
whatever
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
thank
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Agnes
,
fervently
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
the
surplus
that
would
be
left
as
his
means
of
support
---
<EOS>
and
I
suppose
the
house
to
be
sold
,
even
in
saying
this
---
would
be
so
small
,
not
exceeding
in
all
probability
some
hundreds
of
pounds
,
that
perhaps
,
Miss
Wickfield
,
it
would
be
best
to
consider
whether
he
might
not
retain
his
agency
of
the
estate
to
which
he
has
so
long
been
receiver
.
 
<EOS>
His
friends
might
advise
him
,
you
know
;
now
he
is
free
.
 
<EOS>
You
yourself
,
Miss
Wickfield
---
<EOS>
Copperfield
---
<EOS>
I
---
"
   
"
I
have
considered
it
,
Trotwood
,
"
said
Agnes
,
looking
to
me
,
"
and
I
feel
that
it
ought
not
to
be
,
and
must
not
be
;
even
on
the
recommendation
of
a
friend
to
whom
I
am
so
grateful
,
and
owe
so
much
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
say
that
I
recommend
it
,
"
observed
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
right
to
suggest
it
.
 
<EOS>
No
more
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
happy
to
hear
you
say
so
,
"
answered
Agnes
,
steadily
,
"
for
it
gives
me
hope
,
almost
assurance
,
that
we
think
alike
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Mr
Traddles
and
dear
Trotwood
,
papa
once
free
with
honour
,
what
could
I
wish
for
!
<EOS>
I
have
always
aspired
,
if
I
could
have
released
him
from
the
toils
in
which
he
was
held
,
to
render
back
some
little
portion
of
the
love
and
care
<EOS>
I
owe
him
,
and
to
devote
my
life
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
,
for
years
,
the
utmost
height
of
my
hopes
.
 
<EOS>
To
take
our
future
on
myself
,
will
be
the
next
great
happiness
---
the
next
to
his
release
from
all
trust
and
responsibility
---
that
I
can
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
thought
how
,
Agnes
?
"
   
"
Often
!
<EOS>
I
am
not
afraid
,
dear
Trotwood
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
certain
of
success
.
<EOS>
So
many
people
know
me
here
,
and
think
kindly
of
me
,
that
I
am
certain
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
mistrust
me
.
 
<EOS>
Our
wants
are
not
many
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
rent
the
dear
old
house
,
and
keep
a
school
,
I
shall
be
useful
and
happy
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
calm
fervour
of
her
cheerful
voice
brought
back
so
vividly
,
first
the
dear
old
house
itself
,
and
then
my
solitary
home
,
that
my
heart
was
too
full
for
speech
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
pretended
for
a
little
while
to
be
busily
looking
among
the
papers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Next
,
Miss
Trotwood
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
that
property
of
yours
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
sighed
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
I
have
got
to
say
about
it
is
,
that
if
it
's
gone
,
I
can
bear
it
;
and
if
it
's
not
gone
,
I
shall
be
glad
to
get
it
back
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
originally
,
I
think
,
eight
thousand
pounds
,
Consols
?
"
said
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
Right
!
"
replied
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
account
for
more
than
five
,
"
said
Traddles
,
with
an
air
of
perplexity
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
thousand
,
<EOS>
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
my
aunt
,
with
uncommon
composure
,
"
or
pounds
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Five
thousand
pounds
,
"
said
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
all
there
was
,
"
returned
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
sold
three
,
myself
.
<EOS>
One
,
I
paid
for
your
articles
,
Trot
,
my
dear
;
and
the
other
two
I
have
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
lost
the
rest
,
I
thought
it
wise
to
say
nothing
about
that
sum
,
but
to
keep
it
secretly
for
a
rainy
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
see
how
you
would
come
out
of
the
trial
,
Trot
;
and
you
came
out
nobly
---
persevering
,
self
-
reliant
,
self
-
denying
!
<EOS>
So
did
Dick
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
speak
to
me
,
for
I
find
my
nerves
a
little
shaken
!
"
   
<EOS>
Nobody
would
have
thought
so
,
to
see
her
sitting
upright
,
with
her
arms
folded
;
but
she
had
wonderful
self
-
command
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
am
delighted
to
say
,
"
cried
Traddles
,
beaming
with
joy
,
"
that
we
have
recovered
the
whole
money
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
congratulate
me
,
anybody
!
"
exclaimed
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
so
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
believed
it
had
been
misappropriated
by
Mr
Wickfield
?
"
said
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
did
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
and
was
therefore
easily
silenced
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
,
not
a
word
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
indeed
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
it
was
sold
,
by
virtue
of
the
power
of
management
he
held
from
you
;
but
I
need
n't
say
by
whom
sold
,
or
on
whose
actual
signature
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
afterwards
pretended
to
Mr
Wickfield
,
by
that
rascal
,
---
and
proved
,
too
,
by
figures
,
---
that
he
had
possessed
himself
of
the
money
(
on
general
instructions
,
he
said
)
to
keep
other
deficiencies
and
difficulties
from
the
light
.
<EOS>
Mr
Wickfield
,
being
so
weak
and
helpless
in
his
hands
as
to
pay
you
,
afterwards
,
several
sums
of
interest
on
a
pretended
principal
which
he
knew
did
not
exist
,
made
himself
,
unhappily
,
a
party
to
the
fraud
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
at
last
took
the
blame
upon
himself
,
"
added
my
aunt
;
"
and
wrote
me
a
mad
letter
,
charging
himself
with
robbery
,
and
wrong
unheard
of
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
I
paid
him
a
visit
early
one
morning
,
called
for
a
candle
,
burnt
the
letter
,
and
told
him
if
he
ever
could
right
me
and
himself
,
to
do
it
;
and
if
he
could
n't
,
to
keep
his
own
counsel
for
his
daughter
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
---
If
anybody
speaks
to
me
,
I
'll
leave
the
house
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
all
remained
quiet
;
Agnes
covering
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
friend
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
after
a
pause
,
"
and
you
have
really
extorted
the
money
back
from
him
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
fact
is
,
"
returned
Traddles
,
"
Mr
Micawber
had
so
completely
hemmed
him
in
,
and
was
always
ready
with
so
many
new
points
if
an
old
one
failed
,
that
he
could
not
escape
from
us
.
 
<EOS>
A
most
remarkable
circumstance
is
,
that
I
really
do
n't
think
he
grasped
this
sum
even
so
much
for
the
gratification
of
his
avarice
,
which
was
inordinate
,
as
in
the
hatred
he
felt
for
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
so
to
me
,
plainly
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
would
even
have
spent
as
much
,
to
baulk
or
injure
Copperfield
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
said
my
aunt
,
knitting
her
brows
thoughtfully
,
and
glancing
at
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
's
become
of
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
He
left
here
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
with
his
mother
,
who
had
been
clamouring
,
and
beseeching
,
and
disclosing
,
the
whole
time
.
 
<EOS>
They
went
away
by
one
of
the
London
night
coaches
,
and
I
know
no
more
about
him
;
except
that
his
malevolence
to
me
at
parting
was
audacious
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
consider
himself
hardly
less
indebted
to
me
,
than
to
Mr
Micawber
;
which
I
consider
(
as
I
told
him
)
quite
a
compliment
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
suppose
he
has
any
money
,
Traddles
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
,
yes
,
I
should
think
so
,
"
he
replied
,
shaking
his
head
,
seriously
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
he
must
have
pocketed
a
good
deal
,
in
one
way
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
I
think
you
would
find
,
Copperfield
,
if
you
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
his
course
,
that
money
would
never
keep
that
man
out
of
mischief
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
such
an
incarnate
hypocrite
,
that
whatever
object
he
pursues
,
he
must
pursue
crookedly
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
his
only
compensation
for
the
outward
restraints
he
puts
upon
himself
.
<EOS>
Always
creeping
along
the
ground
to
some
small
end
or
other
,
he
will
always
magnify
every
object
in
the
way
;
and
consequently
will
hate
and
suspect
everybody
that
comes
,
in
the
most
innocent
manner
,
between
him
and
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
crooked
courses
will
become
crookeder
,
at
any
moment
,
for
the
least
reason
,
or
for
none
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
only
necessary
to
consider
his
history
here
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
to
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
monster
of
meanness
!
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Really
I
do
n't
know
about
that
,
"
observed
Traddles
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
"
Many
people
can
be
very
mean
,
when
they
give
their
minds
to
it
.
"
   
"
And
now
,
touching
Mr
Micawber
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
really
,
"
said
Traddles
,
cheerfully
,
"
I
must
,
once
more
,
give
Mr
Micawber
high
praise
.
 
<EOS>
But
for
his
having
been
so
patient
and
persevering
for
so
long
a
time
,
we
never
could
have
hoped
to
do
anything
worth
speaking
of
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
think
we
ought
to
consider
that
Mr
Micawber
did
right
,
for
right
's
sake
,
when
we
reflect
what
terms
he
might
have
made
with
Uriah
Heep
himself
,
for
his
silence
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
too
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
what
would
you
give
him
?
"
inquired
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Before
you
come
to
that
,
"
said
Traddles
,
a
little
disconcerted
,
"
I
am
afraid
I
thought
it
discreet
to
omit
(
not
being
able
to
carry
everything
before
me
)
<EOS>
two
points
,
in
making
this
lawless
adjustment
---
for
it
's
perfectly
lawless
from
beginning
to
end
---
of
a
difficult
affair
.
 
<EOS>
Those
IOU
's
,
and
so
forth
,
which
Mr
Micawber
gave
him
for
the
advances
he
had
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
They
must
be
paid
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
I
do
n't
know
when
they
may
be
proceeded
on
,
or
where
they
are
,
"
rejoined
Traddles
,
opening
his
eyes
;
"
and
I
anticipate
,
that
,
between
this
time
and
his
departure
,
Mr
Micawber
will
be
constantly
arrested
,
or
taken
in
execution
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
he
must
be
constantly
set
free
again
,
and
taken
out
of
execution
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
amount
altogether
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mr
Micawber
has
entered
the
transactions
---
he
calls
them
transactions
---
with
great
form
,
in
a
book
,
"
rejoined
Traddles
,
smiling
;
"
and
he
makes
the
amount
a
hundred
and
three
pounds
,
five
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
what
shall
we
give
him
,
that
sum
included
?
"
said
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
Agnes
,
my
dear
,
you
and
I
can
talk
about
division
of
it
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
What
should
it
be
?
 
<EOS>
Five
hundred
pounds
?
"
   
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Traddles
and
I
both
struck
in
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
We
both
recommended
a
small
sum
in
money
,
and
the
payment
,
without
stipulation
to
Mr
Micawber
,
of
the
Uriah
claims
as
they
came
in
.
<EOS>
We
proposed
that
the
family
should
have
their
passage
and
their
outfit
,
and
a
hundred
pounds
;
and
that
Mr
Micawber
's
arrangement
for
the
repayment
of
the
advances
should
be
gravely
entered
into
,
as
it
might
be
wholesome
for
him
to
suppose
himself
under
that
responsibility
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
,
I
added
the
suggestion
,
that
I
should
give
some
explanation
of
his
character
and
history
to
Mr
Peggotty
,
who
I
knew
could
be
relied
on
;
and
that
to
Mr
Peggotty
should
be
quietly
entrusted
the
discretion
of
advancing
another
hundred
.
 
<EOS>
I
further
proposed
to
interest
Mr
Micawber
in
Mr
Peggotty
,
by
confiding
so
much
of
Mr
Peggotty
's
story
to
him
as
I
might
feel
justified
in
relating
,
or
might
think
expedient
;
and
to
endeavour
to
bring
each
of
them
to
bear
upon
the
other
,
for
the
common
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
entered
warmly
into
these
views
;
and
I
may
mention
at
once
,
that
the
principals
themselves
did
so
,
shortly
afterwards
,
with
perfect
good
will
and
harmony
.
   
<EOS>
Seeing
that
Traddles
now
glanced
anxiously
at
my
aunt
again
,
I
reminded
him
of
the
second
and
last
point
to
which
he
had
adverted
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
and
your
aunt
will
excuse
me
,
Copperfield
,
if
I
touch
upon
a
painful
theme
,
as
I
greatly
fear
I
shall
,
"
said
Traddles
,
hesitating
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
necessary
to
bring
it
to
your
recollection
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
day
of
Mr
Micawber
's
memorable
denunciation
a
threatening
allusion
was
made
by
Uriah
Heep
to
your
aunt
's
---
husband
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
retaining
her
stiff
position
,
and
apparent
composure
,
assented
with
a
nod
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
observed
Traddles
,
"
it
was
mere
purposeless
impertinence
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
returned
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
was
---
pardon
me
---
really
such
a
person
,
and
at
all
in
his
power
?
"
hinted
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
good
friend
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
Traddles
,
with
a
perceptible
lengthening
of
his
face
,
explained
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
approach
this
subject
;
that
it
had
shared
the
fate
of
Mr
Micawber
's
liabilities
,
in
not
being
comprehended
in
the
terms
he
had
made
;
that
we
were
no
longer
of
any
authority
with
Uriah
Heep
;
and
that
if
he
could
do
us
,
or
any
of
us
,
any
injury
or
annoyance
,
no
doubt
he
would
.
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
remained
quiet
;
until
again
some
stray
tears
found
their
way
to
her
cheeks
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
right
,
"
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
very
thoughtful
to
mention
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Can
I
---
or
Copperfield
---
do
anything
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Traddles
,
gently
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
many
times
.
 
<EOS>
Trot
,
my
dear
,
a
vain
threat
!
<EOS>
Let
us
have
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
back
.
 
<EOS>
And
do
n't
any
of
you
speak
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
With
that
she
smoothed
her
dress
,
and
sat
,
with
her
upright
carriage
,
looking
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
!
"
said
my
aunt
,
when
they
entered
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
been
discussing
your
emigration
,
with
many
apologies
to
you
for
keeping
you
out
of
the
room
so
long
;
and
I
'll
tell
you
what
arrangements
we
propose
.
"
   
<EOS>
These
she
explained
to
the
unbounded
satisfaction
of
the
family
,
---
<EOS>
children
and
all
being
then
present
,
---
and
so
much
to
the
awakening
of
Mr
Micawber
's
punctual
habits
in
the
opening
stage
of
all
bill
transactions
,
that
he
could
not
be
dissuaded
from
immediately
rushing
out
,
in
the
highest
spirits
,
to
buy
the
stamps
for
his
notes
of
hand
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
his
joy
received
a
sudden
check
;
for
within
five
minutes
,
he
returned
in
the
custody
of
a
sheriff
's
officer
,
informing
us
,
in
a
flood
of
tears
,
that
all
was
lost
.
 
<EOS>
We
,
being
quite
prepared
for
this
event
,
which
was
of
course
a
proceeding
of
Uriah
Heep
's
,
soon
paid
the
money
;
and
in
five
minutes
more
Mr
Micawber
was
seated
at
the
table
,
filling
up
the
stamps
with
an
expression
of
perfect
joy
,
which
only
that
congenial
employment
,
or
the
making
of
punch
,
could
impart
in
full
completeness
to
his
shining
face
.
 
<EOS>
To
see
him
at
work
on
the
stamps
,
with
the
relish
of
an
artist
,
touching
them
like
pictures
,
looking
at
them
sideways
,
taking
weighty
notes
of
dates
and
amounts
in
his
pocket
-
book
,
and
contemplating
them
when
finished
,
with
a
high
sense
of
their
precious
value
,
was
a
sight
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
the
best
thing
you
can
do
,
sir
,
if
you
'll
allow
me
to
advise
you
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
after
silently
observing
him
,
"
is
to
abjure
that
occupation
for
evermore
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
replied
Mr
Micawber
,
"
it
is
my
intention
to
register
such
a
vow
on
the
virgin
page
of
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
will
attest
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
solemnly
,
"
that
my
son
Wilkins
will
ever
bear
in
mind
,
that
he
had
infinitely
better
put
his
fist
in
the
fire
,
than
use
it
to
handle
the
serpents
that
have
poisoned
the
life
-
blood
of
his
unhappy
parent
!
"
<EOS>
Deeply
affected
,
and
changed
in
a
moment
to
the
image
of
despair
,
Mr
Micawber
regarded
the
serpents
with
a
look
of
gloomy
abhorrence
(
in
which
his
late
admiration
of
them
was
not
quite
subdued
)
,
folded
them
up
and
put
them
in
his
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
This
closed
the
proceedings
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
weary
with
sorrow
and
fatigue
,
and
my
aunt
<EOS>
and
I
were
to
return
to
London
on
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
arranged
that
the
Micawbers
should
follow
us
,
after
effecting
a
sale
of
their
goods
to
a
broker
;
that
Mr
Wickfield
's
affairs
should
be
brought
to
a
settlement
,
with
all
convenient
speed
,
under
the
direction
of
Traddles
;
and
that
Agnes
should
also
come
to
London
,
pending
those
arrangements
.
 
<EOS>
We
passed
the
night
at
the
old
house
,
which
,
freed
from
the
presence
of
the
Heeps
,
seemed
purged
of
a
disease
;
and
I
lay
in
my
old
room
,
like
a
shipwrecked
wanderer
come
home
.
   
<EOS>
We
went
back
next
day
to
my
aunt
's
house
---
not
to
mine
---
and
when
she
and
I
sat
alone
,
as
of
old
,
before
going
to
bed
,
she
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
Trot
,
do
you
really
wish
to
know
what
I
have
had
upon
my
mind
lately
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
do
,
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
ever
was
a
time
when
I
felt
unwilling
that
you
should
have
a
sorrow
or
anxiety
which
I
could
not
share
,
it
is
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
had
sorrow
enough
,
child
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
affectionately
,
"
without
the
addition
of
my
little
miseries
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
no
other
motive
,
Trot
,
in
keeping
anything
from
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
well
,
"
said
I.
 
"
<EOS>
But
tell
me
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
ride
with
me
a
little
way
tomorrow
morning
?
"
asked
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
.
"
   
"
At
nine
,
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
then
,
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
At
nine
,
accordingly
,
we
went
out
in
a
little
chariot
,
and
drove
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
We
drove
a
long
way
through
the
streets
,
until
we
came
to
one
of
the
large
hospitals
.
 
<EOS>
Standing
hard
by
the
building
was
a
plain
hearse
.
 
<EOS>
The
driver
recognized
my
aunt
,
and
,
in
obedience
to
a
motion
of
her
hand
at
the
window
,
drove
slowly
off
;
we
following
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
understand
it
now
,
Trot
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
gone
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
he
die
in
the
hospital
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
sat
immovable
beside
me
;
but
,
again
I
saw
the
stray
tears
on
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
there
once
before
,
"
said
my
aunt
presently
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
ailing
a
long
time
---
a
shattered
,
broken
man
,
these
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
knew
his
state
in
this
last
illness
,
he
asked
them
to
send
for
me
.
<EOS>
He
was
sorry
then
.
 
<EOS>
Very
sorry
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
went
,
I
know
,
aunt
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
went
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
with
him
a
good
deal
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
died
the
night
before
we
went
to
Canterbury
?
"
said
I.
My
aunt
nodded
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
one
can
harm
him
now
,
"
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
vain
threat
.
"
   
<EOS>
We
drove
away
,
out
of
town
,
to
the
churchyard
at
Hornsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Better
here
than
in
the
streets
,
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
born
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
We
alighted
;
and
followed
the
plain
coffin
to
a
corner
<EOS>
I
remember
well
,
where
the
service
was
read
consigning
it
to
the
dust
.
   
<EOS>
"
Six
-
and
-
thirty
years
ago
,
this
day
,
my
dear
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
as
we
walked
back
to
the
chariot
,
"
I
was
married
.
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
us
all
!
<EOS>
"
We
took
our
seats
in
silence
;
and
so
she
sat
beside
me
for
a
long
time
,
holding
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
she
suddenly
burst
into
tears
,
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
He
was
a
fine
-
looking
man
when
I
married
him
,
Trot
---
and
he
was
sadly
changed
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
did
not
last
long
.
 
<EOS>
After
the
relief
of
tears
,
she
soon
became
composed
,
and
even
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
Her
nerves
were
a
little
shaken
,
she
said
,
or
she
would
not
have
given
way
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
us
all
!
   
<EOS>
So
we
rode
back
to
her
little
cottage
at
Highgate
,
where
we
found
the
following
short
note
,
which
had
arrived
by
that
morning
's
post
from
Mr
Micawber

<EOS>
Tempest
 
<EOS>
I
now
approach
an
event
in
my
life
,
so
indelible
,
so
awful
,
so
bound
by
an
infinite
variety
of
ties
to
all
that
has
preceded
it
,
in
these
pages
,
that
,
from
the
beginning
of
my
narrative
,
I
have
seen
it
growing
larger
and
larger
as
I
advanced
,
like
a
great
tower
in
a
plain
,
and
throwing
its
fore
-
cast
shadow
even
on
the
incidents
of
my
childish
days
.
   
<EOS>
For
years
after
it
occurred
,
I
dreamed
of
it
often
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
started
up
so
vividly
impressed
by
it
,
that
its
fury
has
yet
seemed
raging
in
my
quiet
room
,
in
the
still
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dream
of
it
sometimes
,
though
at
lengthened
and
uncertain
intervals
,
to
this
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
an
association
between
it
and
a
stormy
wind
,
or
the
lightest
mention
of
a
sea
-
shore
,
as
strong
as
any
of
which
my
mind
is
conscious
.
 
<EOS>
As
plainly
as
I
behold
what
happened
,
I
will
try
to
write
it
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
recall
it
,
but
see
it
done
;
for
it
happens
again
before
me
.
   
<EOS>
The
time
drawing
on
rapidly
for
the
sailing
of
the
emigrant
-
ship
,
my
good
old
nurse
(
almost
broken
-
hearted
for
me
,
when
we
first
met
)
came
up
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
constantly
with
her
,
and
her
brother
,
and
the
Micawbers
<EOS>
(
they
being
very
much
together
)
;
but
Emily
I
never
saw
.
   
<EOS>
One
evening
when
the
time
was
close
at
hand
,
I
was
alone
with
Peggotty
and
her
brother
.
 
<EOS>
Our
conversation
turned
on
Ham
.
 
<EOS>
She
described
to
us
how
tenderly
he
had
taken
leave
of
her
,
and
how
manfully
and
quietly
he
had
borne
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
all
,
of
late
,
when
she
believed
he
was
most
tried
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
subject
of
which
the
affectionate
creature
never
tired
;
and
our
interest
in
hearing
the
many
examples
which
she
,
who
was
so
much
with
him
,
had
to
relate
,
was
equal
to
hers
in
relating
them
.
   
<EOS>
MY
aunt
<EOS>
and
I
were
at
that
time
vacating
the
two
cottages
at
Highgate
;
I
intending
to
go
abroad
,
and
she
to
return
to
her
house
at
Dover
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
a
temporary
lodging
in
Covent
Garden
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
walked
home
to
it
,
after
this
evening
's
conversation
,
reflecting
on
what
had
passed
between
Ham
and
myself
when
I
was
last
at
Yarmouth
,
I
wavered
in
the
original
purpose
I
had
formed
,
of
leaving
a
letter
for
Emily
when
I
should
take
leave
of
her
uncle
on
board
the
ship
,
and
thought
it
would
be
better
to
write
to
her
now
.
 
<EOS>
She
might
desire
,
I
thought
,
after
receiving
my
communication
,
to
send
some
parting
word
by
me
to
her
unhappy
lover
.
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
give
her
the
opportunity
.
   
<EOS>
I
therefore
sat
down
in
my
room
,
before
going
to
bed
,
and
wrote
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
that
I
had
seen
him
,
and
that
he
had
requested
me
to
tell
her
what
I
have
already
written
in
its
place
in
these
sheets
.
 
<EOS>
I
faithfully
repeated
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
need
to
enlarge
upon
it
,
if
I
had
had
the
right
.
 
<EOS>
Its
deep
fidelity
and
goodness
were
not
to
be
adorned
by
me
or
any
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
it
out
,
to
be
sent
round
in
the
morning
;
with
a
line
to
Mr
Peggotty
,
requesting
him
to
give
it
to
her
;
and
went
to
bed
at
daybreak
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
weaker
than
I
knew
then
;
and
,
not
falling
asleep
until
the
sun
was
up
,
lay
late
,
and
unrefreshed
,
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
roused
by
the
silent
presence
of
my
aunt
at
my
bedside
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
it
in
my
sleep
,
as
I
suppose
we
all
do
feel
such
things
.
   
<EOS>
"
Trot
,
my
dear
,
"
she
said
,
when
I
opened
my
eyes
,
"
I
could
n't
make
up
my
mind
to
disturb
you
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
is
here
;
shall
he
come
up
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
replied
<EOS>
yes
,
and
he
soon
appeared
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
he
said
,
when
we
had
shaken
hands
,
"
I
giv
Em'ly
your
letter
,
sir
,
and
she
writ
this
heer
;
and
begged
of
me
fur
to
ask
you
to
read
it
,
and
if
you
see
no
hurt
in't
,
to
be
so
kind
as
take
charge
on't
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
read
it
?
"
said
I.
   
He
nodded
sorrowfully
.
 
<EOS>
I
opened
it
,
and
read
as
follows
:
     
<EOS>
"
I
have
got
your
message
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
can
I
write
,
to
thank
you
for
your
good
and
blessed
kindness
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
put
the
words
close
to
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
keep
them
till
I
die
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
sharp
thorns
,
but
they
are
such
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
prayed
over
them
,
<EOS>
oh
,
I
have
prayed
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
find
what
you
are
,
and
what
uncle
is
,
I
think
what
God
must
be
,
and
can
cry
to
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
,
my
friend
,
good
-
bye
for
ever
in
this
world
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
world
,
if
I
am
forgiven
,
I
may
wake
a
child
and
come
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
All
thanks
and
blessings
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
,
evermore
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
,
blotted
with
tears
,
was
the
letter
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
tell
her
as
you
doen't
<EOS>
see
no
hurt
in't
,
and
as
you
'll
be
so
kind
as
take
charge
on't
,
Mas'r
Davy
?
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
when
I
had
read
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Unquestionably
,
"
said
I
---
"
but
I
am
thinking
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Mas'r
Davy
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
thinking
,
"
said
I
,
"
that
I
'll
go
down
again
to
Yarmouth
.
<EOS>
There
's
time
,
and
to
spare
,
for
me
to
go
and
come
back
before
the
ship
sails
.
 
<EOS>
My
mind
is
constantly
running
on
him
,
in
his
solitude
;
to
put
this
letter
of
her
writing
in
his
hand
at
this
time
,
and
to
enable
you
to
tell
her
,
in
the
moment
of
parting
,
that
he
has
got
it
,
will
be
a
kindness
to
both
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
solemnly
accepted
his
commission
,
dear
good
fellow
,
and
can
not
discharge
it
too
completely
.
 
<EOS>
The
journey
is
nothing
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
restless
,
and
shall
be
better
in
motion
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
down
tonight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Though
he
anxiously
endeavoured
to
dissuade
me
,
I
saw
that
he
was
of
my
mind
;
and
this
,
if
I
had
required
to
be
confirmed
in
my
intention
,
would
have
had
the
effect
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
round
to
the
coach
office
,
at
my
request
,
and
took
the
box
-
seat
for
me
on
the
mail
.
<EOS>
In
the
evening
I
started
,
by
that
conveyance
,
down
the
road
I
had
traversed
under
so
many
vicissitudes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
think
that
,
"
I
asked
the
coachman
,
in
the
first
stage
out
of
London
,
"
a
very
remarkable
sky
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
remember
to
have
seen
one
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
I
---
not
equal
to
it
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
wind
,
sir
.
<EOS>
There
'll
be
mischief
done
at
sea
,
I
expect
,
before
long
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
murky
confusion
---
here
and
there
blotted
with
a
colour
like
the
colour
of
the
smoke
from
damp
fuel
---
of
flying
clouds
,
<EOS>
tossed
up
into
most
remarkable
heaps
,
suggesting
greater
heights
in
the
clouds
than
there
were
depths
below
them
to
the
bottom
of
the
deepest
hollows
in
the
earth
,
through
which
the
wild
moon
seemed
to
plunge
headlong
,
as
if
,
in
a
dread
disturbance
of
the
laws
of
nature
,
she
had
lost
her
way
and
were
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
wind
all
day
;
and
it
was
rising
then
,
with
an
extraordinary
great
sound
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
hour
it
had
much
increased
,
and
the
sky
was
more
overcast
,
and
blew
hard
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
as
the
night
advanced
,
the
clouds
closing
in
and
densely
over
-
spreading
the
whole
sky
,
then
very
dark
,
it
came
on
to
blow
,
harder
and
harder
.
 
<EOS>
It
still
increased
,
until
our
horses
could
scarcely
face
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
Many
times
,
in
the
dark
part
of
the
night
(
it
was
then
late
in
September
,
when
the
nights
were
not
short
)
,
the
leaders
turned
about
,
or
came
to
a
dead
stop
;
and
we
were
often
in
serious
apprehension
that
the
coach
would
be
blown
over
.
<EOS>
Sweeping
gusts
of
rain
came
up
before
this
storm
,
like
showers
of
steel
;
and
,
at
those
times
,
when
there
was
any
shelter
of
trees
or
lee
walls
to
be
got
,
we
were
fain
to
stop
,
in
a
sheer
impossibility
of
continuing
the
struggle
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
day
broke
,
it
blew
harder
and
harder
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
been
in
Yarmouth
when
the
seamen
said
it
blew
great
guns
,
but
I
had
never
known
the
like
of
this
,
or
anything
approaching
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
came
to
Ipswich
---
very
late
,
having
had
to
fight
every
inch
of
ground
since
we
were
ten
miles
out
of
London
;
and
found
a
cluster
of
people
in
the
market
-
place
,
who
had
risen
from
their
beds
in
the
night
,
fearful
of
falling
chimneys
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
these
,
congregating
about
the
inn
-
yard
while
we
changed
horses
,
told
us
of
great
sheets
of
lead
having
been
ripped
off
a
high
church
-
tower
,
and
flung
into
a
by
-
street
,
which
they
then
blocked
up
.
 
<EOS>
Others
had
to
tell
of
country
people
,
coming
in
from
neighbouring
villages
,
who
had
seen
great
trees
lying
torn
out
of
the
earth
,
and
whole
ricks
scattered
about
the
roads
and
fields
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
there
was
no
abatement
in
the
storm
,
but
it
blew
harder
.
   
<EOS>
As
we
struggled
on
,
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
sea
,
from
which
this
mighty
wind
was
blowing
dead
on
shore
,
its
force
became
more
and
more
terrific
.
 
<EOS>
Long
before
we
saw
the
sea
,
its
spray
was
on
our
lips
,
and
showered
salt
rain
upon
us
.
 
<EOS>
The
water
was
out
,
over
miles
and
miles
of
the
flat
country
adjacent
to
Yarmouth
;
and
every
sheet
and
puddle
lashed
its
banks
,
and
had
its
stress
of
little
breakers
setting
heavily
towards
us
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
came
within
sight
of
the
sea
,
the
waves
on
the
horizon
,
caught
at
intervals
above
the
rolling
abyss
,
were
like
glimpses
of
another
shore
with
towers
and
buildings
.
 
<EOS>
When
at
last
we
got
into
the
town
,
the
people
came
out
to
their
doors
,
all
aslant
,
and
with
streaming
hair
,
making
a
wonder
of
the
mail
that
had
come
through
such
a
night
.
   
<EOS>
I
put
up
at
the
old
inn
,
and
went
down
to
look
at
the
sea
;
staggering
along
the
street
,
which
was
strewn
with
sand
and
seaweed
,
and
with
flying
blotches
of
sea
-
foam
;
afraid
of
falling
slates
and
tiles
;
and
holding
by
people
I
met
,
at
angry
corners
.
<EOS>
Coming
near
the
beach
,
I
saw
,
not
only
the
boatmen
,
but
half
the
people
of
the
town
,
lurking
behind
buildings
;
some
,
now
and
then
braving
the
fury
of
the
storm
to
look
away
to
sea
,
and
blown
sheer
out
of
their
course
in
trying
to
get
zigzag
back
.
   
<EOS>
joining
these
groups
,
I
found
bewailing
women
whose
husbands
were
away
in
herring
or
oyster
boats
,
which
there
was
too
much
reason
to
think
might
have
foundered
before
they
could
run
in
anywhere
for
safety
.
 
<EOS>
Grizzled
old
sailors
were
among
the
people
,
shaking
their
heads
,
as
they
looked
from
water
to
sky
,
and
muttering
to
one
another
;
ship
-
owners
,
excited
and
uneasy
;
children
,
huddling
together
,
and
peering
into
older
faces
;
even
stout
mariners
,
disturbed
and
anxious
,
levelling
their
glasses
at
the
sea
from
behind
places
of
shelter
,
as
if
they
were
surveying
an
enemy
.
   
<EOS>
The
tremendous
sea
itself
,
when
I
could
find
sufficient
pause
to
look
at
it
,
in
the
agitation
of
the
blinding
wind
,
the
flying
stones
and
sand
,
and
the
awful
noise
,
confounded
me
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
high
watery
walls
came
rolling
in
,
and
,
at
their
highest
,
tumbled
into
surf
,
they
looked
as
if
the
least
would
engulf
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
receding
wave
swept
back
with
a
hoarse
roar
,
it
seemed
to
scoop
out
deep
caves
in
the
beach
,
as
if
its
purpose
were
to
undermine
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
When
some
white
-
headed
billows
thundered
on
,
and
dashed
themselves
to
pieces
before
they
reached
the
land
,
every
fragment
of
the
late
whole
seemed
possessed
by
the
full
might
of
its
wrath
,
rushing
to
be
gathered
to
the
composition
of
another
monster
.
<EOS>
Undulating
hills
were
changed
to
valleys
,
undulating
valleys
(
with
a
solitary
storm
-
bird
sometimes
skimming
through
them
)
were
lifted
up
to
hills
;
masses
of
water
shivered
and
shook
the
beach
with
a
booming
sound
;
every
shape
tumultuously
rolled
on
,
as
soon
as
made
,
to
change
its
shape
and
place
,
and
beat
another
shape
and
place
away
;
the
ideal
shore
on
the
horizon
,
with
its
towers
and
buildings
,
rose
and
fell
<EOS>
;
the
clouds
fell
fast
and
thick
;
I
seemed
to
see
a
rending
and
upheaving
of
all
nature
.
   
<EOS>
Not
finding
Ham
among
the
people
whom
this
memorable
wind
---
for
it
is
still
remembered
down
there
,
as
the
greatest
ever
known
to
blow
upon
that
coast
---
had
brought
together
,
I
made
my
way
to
his
house
.
<EOS>
It
was
shut
;
and
as
no
one
answered
to
my
knocking
,
I
went
,
by
back
ways
and
by
-
lanes
,
to
the
yard
where
he
worked
.
 
<EOS>
I
learned
,
there
,
that
he
had
gone
to
Lowestoft
,
to
meet
some
sudden
exigency
of
ship
-
repairing
in
which
his
skill
was
required
;
but
that
he
would
be
back
tomorrow
morning
,
in
good
time
.
   
<EOS>
I
went
back
to
the
inn
;
and
when
I
had
washed
and
dressed
,
and
tried
to
sleep
,
but
in
vain
,
it
was
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
sat
five
minutes
by
the
coffee
-
room
fire
,
when
the
waiter
,
coming
to
stir
it
,
as
an
excuse
for
talking
,
told
me
that
two
colliers
had
gone
down
,
with
all
hands
,
a
few
miles
away
;
and
that
some
other
ships
had
been
seen
labouring
hard
in
the
Roads
,
and
trying
,
in
great
distress
,
to
keep
off
shore
.
 
<EOS>
Mercy
on
them
,
and
on
all
poor
sailors
,
said
he
,
if
we
had
another
night
like
the
last
!
   
<EOS>
I
was
very
much
depressed
in
spirits
;
very
solitary
;
and
felt
an
uneasiness
in
Ham
's
not
being
there
,
disproportionate
to
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
seriously
affected
,
without
knowing
how
much
,
by
late
events
;
and
my
long
exposure
to
the
fierce
wind
had
confused
me
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
that
jumble
in
my
thoughts
and
recollections
,
that
I
had
lost
the
clear
arrangement
of
time
and
distance
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
if
I
had
gone
out
into
the
town
,
I
should
not
have
been
surprised
,
I
think
,
to
encounter
someone
who
I
knew
must
be
then
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
So
to
speak
,
there
was
in
these
respects
a
curious
inattention
in
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
it
was
busy
,
too
,
with
all
the
remembrances
the
place
naturally
awakened
;
and
they
were
particularly
distinct
and
vivid
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
state
,
the
waiter
's
dismal
intelligence
about
the
ships
immediately
connected
itself
,
without
any
effort
of
my
volition
,
with
my
uneasiness
about
Ham
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
persuaded
that
I
had
an
apprehension
of
his
returning
from
Lowestoft
by
sea
,
and
being
lost
.
 
<EOS>
This
grew
so
strong
with
me
,
that
I
resolved
to
go
back
to
the
yard
before
I
took
my
dinner
,
and
ask
the
boat
-
builder
if
he
thought
his
attempting
to
return
by
sea
at
all
likely
?
 
<EOS>
If
he
gave
me
the
least
reason
to
think
so
,
I
would
go
over
to
Lowestoft
and
prevent
it
by
bringing
him
with
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
hastily
ordered
my
dinner
,
and
went
back
to
the
yard
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
none
too
soon
;
for
the
boat
-
builder
,
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
,
was
locking
the
yard
-
gate
.
 
<EOS>
He
quite
laughed
when
I
asked
him
the
question
,
and
said
there
was
no
fear
;
no
man
in
his
senses
,
or
out
of
them
,
would
put
off
in
such
a
gale
of
wind
,
least
of
all
Ham
Peggotty
,
who
had
been
born
to
seafaring
.
   
<EOS>
So
sensible
of
this
,
beforehand
,
that
I
had
really
felt
ashamed
of
doing
what
I
was
nevertheless
impelled
to
do
,
I
went
back
to
the
inn
.
 
<EOS>
If
such
a
wind
could
rise
,
I
think
it
was
rising
.
 
<EOS>
The
howl
and
roar
,
the
rattling
of
the
doors
and
windows
,
the
rumbling
in
the
chimneys
,
the
apparent
rocking
of
the
very
house
that
sheltered
me
,
and
the
prodigious
tumult
of
the
sea
,
were
more
fearful
than
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
now
a
great
darkness
besides
;
and
that
invested
the
storm
with
new
terrors
,
real
and
fanciful
.
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
eat
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
sit
still
,
I
could
not
continue
steadfast
to
anything
.
 
<EOS>
Something
within
me
,
faintly
answering
to
the
storm
without
,
tossed
up
the
depths
of
my
memory
and
made
a
tumult
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
in
all
the
hurry
of
my
thoughts
,
wild
running
with
the
thundering
sea
,
---
<EOS>
the
storm
,
and
my
uneasiness
regarding
Ham
were
always
in
the
fore
-
ground
.
   
<EOS>
My
dinner
went
away
almost
untasted
,
and
I
tried
to
refresh
myself
with
a
glass
or
two
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
In
vain
.
 
<EOS>
I
fell
into
a
dull
slumber
before
the
fire
,
without
losing
my
consciousness
,
either
of
the
uproar
out
of
doors
,
or
of
the
place
in
which
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
Both
became
overshadowed
by
a
new
and
indefinable
horror
;
and
when
I
awoke
---
or
rather
when
I
shook
off
the
lethargy
that
bound
me
in
my
chair
---
my
whole
frame
thrilled
with
objectless
and
unintelligible
fear
.
   
<EOS>
I
walked
to
and
fro
,
tried
to
read
an
old
gazetteer
,
listened
to
the
awful
noises
:
<EOS>
looked
at
faces
,
scenes
,
and
figures
in
the
fire
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
steady
ticking
of
the
undisturbed
clock
on
the
wall
tormented
me
to
that
degree
that
I
resolved
to
go
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
reassuring
,
on
such
a
night
,
to
be
told
that
some
of
the
inn
-
servants
had
agreed
together
to
sit
up
until
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
bed
,
exceedingly
weary
and
heavy
;
but
,
on
my
lying
down
,
all
such
sensations
vanished
,
as
if
by
magic
,
and
I
was
broad
awake
,
with
every
sense
refined
.
   
<EOS>
For
hours
I
lay
there
,
listening
to
the
wind
and
water
;
imagining
,
now
,
that
I
heard
shrieks
out
at
sea
;
now
,
that
I
distinctly
heard
the
firing
of
signal
guns
;
and
now
,
the
fall
of
houses
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
I
got
up
,
several
times
,
and
looked
out
;
but
could
see
nothing
,
except
the
reflection
in
the
window
-
panes
of
the
faint
candle
I
had
left
burning
,
and
of
my
own
haggard
face
looking
in
at
me
from
the
black
void
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
,
my
restlessness
attained
to
such
a
pitch
,
that
I
hurried
on
my
clothes
,
and
went
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
large
kitchen
,
where
I
dimly
saw
bacon
and
ropes
of
onions
hanging
from
the
beams
,
the
watchers
were
clustered
together
,
in
various
attitudes
,
about
a
table
,
purposely
moved
away
from
the
great
chimney
,
and
brought
near
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
A
pretty
girl
,
who
had
her
ears
stopped
with
her
apron
,
and
her
eyes
upon
the
door
,
screamed
when
I
appeared
,
supposing
me
to
be
a
spirit
;
but
the
others
had
more
presence
of
mind
,
and
were
glad
of
an
addition
to
their
company
.
 
<EOS>
One
man
,
referring
to
the
topic
they
had
been
discussing
,
asked
me
whether
I
thought
the
souls
of
the
collier
-
crews
who
had
gone
down
,
were
out
in
the
storm
?
   
<EOS>
I
remained
there
,
I
dare
say
,
two
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Once
,
I
opened
the
yard
-
gate
,
and
looked
into
the
empty
street
.
 
<EOS>
The
sand
,
the
sea
-
weed
,
and
the
flakes
of
foam
,
were
driving
by
;
and
I
was
obliged
to
call
for
assistance
before
I
could
shut
the
gate
again
,
and
make
it
fast
against
the
wind
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
dark
gloom
in
my
solitary
chamber
,
when
I
at
length
returned
to
it
;
but
I
was
tired
now
,
and
,
getting
into
bed
again
,
fell
---
off
a
tower
and
down
a
precipice
---
into
the
depths
of
sleep
.
<EOS>
I
have
an
impression
that
for
a
long
time
,
though
I
dreamed
of
being
elsewhere
and
in
a
variety
of
scenes
,
it
was
always
blowing
in
my
dream
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
I
lost
that
feeble
hold
upon
reality
,
and
was
engaged
with
two
dear
friends
,
but
who
they
were
I
do
n't
know
,
at
the
siege
of
some
town
in
a
roar
of
cannonading
.
   
<EOS>
The
thunder
of
the
cannon
was
so
loud
and
incessant
,
that
I
could
not
hear
something
I
much
desired
to
hear
,
until
I
made
a
great
exertion
and
awoke
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
broad
day
---
eight
or
nine
o'clock
;
<EOS>
the
storm
raging
,
in
lieu
of
the
batteries
;
and
someone
knocking
and
calling
at
my
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
I
cried
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
wreck
!
<EOS>
Close
by
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
sprung
out
of
bed
,
and
asked
,
what
wreck
?
   
<EOS>
"
A
schooner
,
from
Spain
or
Portugal
,
laden
with
fruit
and
wine
.
<EOS>
Make
haste
,
sir
,
if
you
want
to
see
her
!
<EOS>
It
's
thought
,
down
on
the
beach
,
she
'll
go
to
pieces
every
moment
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
excited
voice
went
clamouring
along
the
staircase
;
and
I
wrapped
myself
in
my
clothes
as
quickly
as
I
could
,
and
ran
into
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
Numbers
of
people
were
there
before
me
,
all
running
in
one
direction
,
to
the
beach
.
 
<EOS>
I
ran
the
same
way
,
outstripping
a
good
many
,
and
soon
came
facing
the
wild
sea
.
   
<EOS>
The
wind
might
by
this
time
have
lulled
a
little
,
though
not
more
sensibly
than
if
the
cannonading
I
had
dreamed
of
,
had
been
diminished
by
the
silencing
of
half
-
a
-
dozen
guns
out
of
hundreds
.
<EOS>
But
the
sea
,
having
upon
it
the
additional
agitation
of
the
whole
night
,
was
infinitely
more
terrific
than
when
I
had
seen
it
last
.
<EOS>
Every
appearance
it
had
then
presented
,
bore
the
expression
of
being
swelled
;
and
the
height
to
which
the
breakers
rose
,
and
,
looking
over
one
another
,
bore
one
another
down
,
and
rolled
in
,
in
interminable
hosts
,
was
most
appalling
.
<EOS>
In
the
difficulty
of
hearing
anything
but
wind
and
waves
,
and
in
the
crowd
,
and
the
unspeakable
confusion
,
and
my
first
breathless
efforts
to
stand
against
the
weather
,
I
was
so
confused
that
I
looked
out
to
sea
for
the
wreck
,
and
saw
nothing
but
the
foaming
heads
of
the
great
waves
.
 
<EOS>
A
half
-
dressed
boatman
,
standing
next
me
,
pointed
with
his
bare
arm
(
a
tattoo'd
arrow
on
it
,
pointing
in
the
same
direction
)
to
the
left
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
O
great
Heaven
,
I
saw
it
,
close
in
upon
us
!
   
<EOS>
One
mast
was
broken
short
off
,
six
or
eight
feet
from
the
deck
,
and
lay
over
the
side
,
entangled
in
a
maze
of
sail
and
rigging
;
and
all
that
ruin
,
as
the
ship
rolled
and
beat
---
which
she
did
without
a
moment
's
pause
,
and
with
a
violence
quite
inconceivable
---
beat
the
side
as
if
it
would
stave
it
in
.
 
<EOS>
Some
efforts
were
even
then
being
made
,
to
cut
this
portion
of
the
wreck
away
;
for
,
as
the
ship
,
which
was
broadside
on
,
turned
towards
us
in
her
rolling
<EOS>
,
I
plainly
descried
her
people
at
work
with
axes
,
especially
one
active
figure
with
long
curling
hair
,
conspicuous
among
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
But
a
great
cry
,
which
was
audible
even
above
the
wind
and
water
,
rose
from
the
shore
at
this
moment
;
the
sea
,
sweeping
over
the
rolling
wreck
,
made
a
clean
breach
,
and
carried
men
,
spars
,
casks
,
planks
,
bulwarks
,
heaps
of
such
toys
,
into
the
boiling
surge
.
   
<EOS>
The
second
mast
was
yet
standing
,
with
the
rags
of
a
rent
sail
,
and
a
wild
confusion
of
broken
cordage
flapping
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
The
ship
had
struck
once
,
the
same
boatman
hoarsely
said
in
my
ear
,
and
then
lifted
in
and
struck
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
understood
him
to
add
that
she
was
parting
amidships
,
and
I
could
readily
suppose
so
,
for
the
rolling
and
beating
were
too
tremendous
for
any
human
work
to
suffer
long
.
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
there
was
another
great
cry
of
pity
from
the
beach
;
four
men
arose
with
the
wreck
out
of
the
deep
,
clinging
to
the
rigging
of
the
remaining
mast
;
uppermost
,
the
active
figure
with
the
curling
hair
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
bell
on
board
;
and
as
the
ship
rolled
and
dashed
,
like
a
desperate
creature
driven
mad
,
now
showing
us
the
whole
sweep
of
her
deck
,
as
she
turned
on
her
beam
-
ends
towards
the
shore
,
now
nothing
but
her
keel
,
as
she
sprung
wildly
over
and
turned
towards
the
sea
,
the
bell
rang
;
and
its
sound
,
the
knell
of
those
unhappy
men
,
was
borne
towards
us
on
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
Again
we
lost
her
,
and
again
she
rose
.
 
<EOS>
Two
men
were
gone
.
 
<EOS>
The
agony
on
the
shore
increased
.
 
<EOS>
Men
groaned
,
and
clasped
their
hands
;
women
shrieked
,
and
turned
away
their
faces
.
 
<EOS>
Some
ran
wildly
up
and
down
along
the
beach
,
crying
for
help
where
no
help
could
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
myself
one
of
these
,
frantically
imploring
a
knot
of
sailors
whom
I
knew
,
not
to
let
those
two
lost
creatures
perish
before
our
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
making
out
to
me
,
in
an
agitated
way
---
I
do
n't
know
how
,
for
the
little
I
could
hear
I
was
scarcely
composed
enough
to
understand
---
that
the
lifeboat
had
been
bravely
manned
an
hour
ago
,
and
could
do
nothing
;
and
that
as
no
man
would
be
so
desperate
as
to
attempt
to
wade
off
with
a
rope
,
and
establish
a
communication
with
the
shore
<EOS>
,
there
was
nothing
left
to
try
;
when
I
noticed
that
some
new
sensation
moved
the
people
on
the
beach
,
and
saw
them
part
,
and
Ham
come
breaking
through
them
to
the
front
.
   
<EOS>
I
ran
to
him
---
as
well
as
I
know
,
to
repeat
my
appeal
for
help
.
<EOS>
But
,
distracted
though
I
was
,
by
a
sight
so
new
to
me
and
terrible
,
the
determination
in
his
face
,
and
his
look
out
to
sea
---
exactly
the
same
look
as
I
remembered
in
connexion
with
the
morning
after
Emily
's
flight
---
awoke
me
to
a
knowledge
of
his
danger
.
 
<EOS>
I
held
him
back
with
both
arms
;
and
implored
the
men
with
whom
I
had
been
speaking
,
not
to
listen
to
him
,
not
to
do
murder
,
not
to
let
him
stir
from
off
that
sand
!
   
<EOS>
Another
cry
arose
on
shore
;
and
looking
to
the
wreck
,
we
saw
the
cruel
sail
,
with
blow
on
blow
,
beat
off
the
lower
of
the
two
men
,
and
fly
up
in
triumph
round
the
active
figure
left
alone
upon
the
mast
.
   
<EOS>
Against
such
a
sight
,
and
against
such
determination
as
that
of
the
calmly
desperate
man
who
was
already
accustomed
to
lead
half
the
people
present
,
I
might
as
hopefully
have
entreated
the
wind
.
"
<EOS>
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
he
said
,
cheerily
grasping
me
by
both
hands
,
"
if
my
time
is
come
,
'
tis
come
.
 
<EOS>
If
'
tan't
,
I
'll
bide
it
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
above
bless
you
,
and
bless
all
!
<EOS>
Mates
,
make
me
ready
!
<EOS>
I
'm
a
-
going
off
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
swept
away
,
but
not
unkindly
,
to
some
distance
,
where
the
people
around
me
made
me
stay
;
urging
,
as
I
confusedly
perceived
,
that
he
was
bent
on
going
,
with
help
or
without
,
and
that
I
should
endanger
the
precautions
for
his
safety
by
troubling
those
with
whom
they
rested
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
I
answered
,
or
what
they
rejoined
;
but
I
saw
hurry
on
the
beach
,
and
men
running
with
ropes
from
a
capstan
that
was
there
,
and
penetrating
into
a
circle
of
figures
that
hid
him
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
I
saw
him
standing
alone
,
in
a
seaman
's
frock
and
trousers
:
a
rope
in
his
hand
,
or
slung
to
his
wrist
:
<EOS>
another
round
his
body
:
and
several
of
the
best
men
holding
,
at
a
little
distance
,
to
the
latter
,
which
he
laid
out
himself
,
slack
upon
the
shore
,
at
his
feet
.
   
<EOS>
The
wreck
,
even
to
my
unpractised
eye
,
was
breaking
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
that
she
was
parting
in
the
middle
,
and
that
the
life
of
the
solitary
man
upon
the
mast
hung
by
a
thread
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
he
clung
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
singular
red
cap
on
,
---
not
like
a
sailor
's
cap
,
but
of
a
finer
colour
;
and
as
the
few
yielding
planks
between
him
and
destruction
rolled
and
bulged
,
and
his
anticipative
death
-
knell
rung
,
he
was
seen
by
all
of
us
to
wave
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
him
do
it
now
,
and
thought
I
was
going
distracted
,
when
his
action
brought
an
old
remembrance
to
my
mind
of
a
once
dear
friend
.
   
<EOS>
Ham
watched
the
sea
,
standing
alone
,
with
the
silence
of
suspended
breath
behind
him
,
and
the
storm
before
,
until
there
was
a
great
retiring
wave
,
when
,
with
a
backward
glance
at
those
who
held
the
rope
which
was
made
fast
round
his
body
,
he
dashed
in
after
it
,
and
in
a
moment
was
buffeting
with
the
water
;
rising
with
the
hills
,
falling
with
the
valleys
,
lost
beneath
the
foam
;
then
drawn
again
to
land
.
 
<EOS>
They
hauled
in
hastily
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
blood
on
his
face
,
from
where
I
stood
;
but
he
took
no
thought
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
hurriedly
to
give
them
some
directions
for
leaving
him
more
free
---
or
<EOS>
so
I
judged
from
the
motion
of
his
arm
---
and
was
gone
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
he
made
for
the
wreck
,
rising
with
the
hills
,
falling
with
the
valleys
,
lost
beneath
the
rugged
foam
,
borne
in
towards
the
shore
,
borne
on
towards
the
ship
,
striving
hard
and
valiantly
.
 
<EOS>
The
distance
was
nothing
,
but
the
power
of
the
sea
and
wind
made
the
strife
deadly
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
neared
the
wreck
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
near
,
that
with
one
more
of
his
vigorous
strokes
he
would
be
clinging
to
it
,
---
<EOS>
when
a
high
,
green
,
vast
hill
-
side
of
water
,
moving
on
shoreward
,
from
beyond
the
ship
,
he
seemed
to
leap
up
into
it
with
a
mighty
bound
,
and
the
ship
was
gone
!
   
<EOS>
Some
eddying
fragments
I
saw
in
the
sea
,
as
if
a
mere
cask
had
been
broken
,
in
running
to
the
spot
where
they
were
hauling
in
.
<EOS>
Consternation
was
in
every
face
.
 
<EOS>
They
drew
him
to
my
very
feet
---
insensible
---
dead
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
carried
to
the
nearest
house
;
and
,
no
one
preventing
me
now
,
I
remained
near
him
,
busy
,
while
every
means
of
restoration
were
tried
;
but
he
had
been
beaten
to
death
by
the
great
wave
,
and
his
generous
heart
was
stilled
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
As
I
sat
beside
the
bed
,
when
hope
was
abandoned
and
all
was
done
,
a
fisherman
,
who
had
known
me
when
Emily
and
I
were
children
,
and
ever
since
,
whispered
my
name
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
he
,
with
tears
starting
to
his
weather
-
beaten
face
,
which
,
with
his
trembling
lips
,
was
ashy
pale
,
"
will
you
come
over
yonder
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
remembrance
that
had
been
recalled
to
me
,
was
in
his
look
.
<EOS>
I
asked
him
,
terror
-
stricken
,
leaning
on
the
arm
he
held
out
to
support
me
:
   
"
<EOS>
Has
a
body
come
ashore
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
said
,
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
I
know
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
then
.
   
<EOS>
He
answered
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
But
he
led
me
to
the
shore
.
 
<EOS>
And
on
that
part
of
it
where
she
and
I
had
looked
for
shells
,
two
children
---
on
that
part
of
it
where
some
lighter
fragments
of
the
old
boat
,
blown
down
last
night
,
had
been
scattered
by
the
wind
---
among
the
ruins
of
the
home
he
had
wronged
<EOS>
---
I
saw
him
lying
with
his
head
upon
his
arm
,
as
I
had
often
seen
him
lie
at
school
.

Chapter

<EOS>
The
new
wound
,
and
the
old
 
<EOS>
No
need
,
O
Steerforth
,
to
have
said
,
when
we
last
spoke
together
,
in
that
hour
which
I
so
little
deemed
to
be
our
parting
-
hour
---
<EOS>
no
need
to
have
said
,
"
Think
of
me
at
my
best
!
<EOS>
"
I
had
done
that
ever
;
and
could
I
change
now
,
looking
on
this
sight
!
   
<EOS>
They
brought
a
hand
-
bier
,
and
laid
him
on
it
,
and
covered
him
with
a
flag
,
and
took
him
up
and
bore
him
on
towards
the
houses
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
men
who
carried
him
had
known
him
,
and
gone
sailing
with
him
,
and
seen
him
merry
and
bold
.
 
<EOS>
They
carried
him
through
the
wild
roar
,
a
hush
in
the
midst
of
all
the
tumult
;
and
took
him
to
the
cottage
where
Death
was
already
.
   
<EOS>
But
when
they
set
the
bier
down
on
the
threshold
,
they
looked
at
one
another
,
and
at
me
,
and
whispered
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
why
.
 
<EOS>
They
felt
as
if
it
were
not
right
to
lay
him
down
in
the
same
quiet
room
.
   
<EOS>
We
went
into
the
town
,
and
took
our
burden
to
the
inn
.
 
<EOS>
So
soon
as
I
could
at
all
collect
my
thoughts
,
I
sent
for
Joram
,
and
begged
him
to
provide
me
a
conveyance
in
which
it
could
be
got
to
London
in
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
that
the
care
of
it
,
and
the
hard
duty
of
preparing
his
mother
to
receive
it
,
could
only
rest
with
me
;
and
I
was
anxious
to
discharge
that
duty
as
faithfully
as
I
could
.
   
<EOS>
I
chose
the
night
for
the
journey
,
that
there
might
be
less
curiosity
when
I
left
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
although
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
I
came
out
of
the
yard
in
a
chaise
,
followed
by
what
I
had
in
charge
,
there
were
many
people
waiting
.
 
<EOS>
At
intervals
,
along
the
town
,
and
even
a
little
way
out
upon
the
road
,
I
saw
more
:
but
at
length
only
the
bleak
night
and
the
open
country
were
around
me
,
and
the
ashes
of
my
youthful
friendship
.
   
<EOS>
Upon
a
mellow
autumn
day
,
about
noon
,
when
the
ground
was
perfumed
by
fallen
leaves
,
and
many
more
,
in
beautiful
tints
of
yellow
,
red
,
and
brown
,
yet
hung
upon
the
trees
,
through
which
the
sun
was
shining
,
I
arrived
at
Highgate
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
the
last
mile
,
thinking
as
I
went
along
of
what
I
had
to
do
;
and
left
the
carriage
that
had
followed
me
all
through
the
night
,
awaiting
orders
to
advance
.
   
<EOS>
The
house
,
when
I
came
up
to
it
,
looked
just
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
blind
was
raised
;
no
sign
of
life
was
in
the
dull
paved
court
,
with
its
covered
way
leading
to
the
disused
door
.
 
<EOS>
The
wind
had
quite
gone
down
,
and
nothing
moved
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
not
,
at
first
,
the
courage
to
ring
at
the
gate
;
and
<EOS>
when
I
did
ring
,
my
errand
seemed
to
me
to
be
expressed
in
the
very
sound
of
the
bell
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
parlour
-
maid
came
out
,
with
the
key
in
her
hand
;
and
looking
earnestly
at
me
as
she
unlocked
the
gate
,
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
ill
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
much
agitated
,
and
am
fatigued
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
anything
the
matter
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
---
Mr
James
?
 
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
Hush
!
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
something
has
happened
,
that
I
have
to
break
to
Mrs
Steerforth
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
at
home
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
girl
anxiously
replied
that
her
mistress
was
very
seldom
out
now
,
even
in
a
carriage
;
that
she
kept
her
room
;
that
she
saw
no
company
,
but
would
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mistress
was
up
,
she
said
,
and
Miss
Dartle
was
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
What
message
should
she
take
upstairs
?
   
<EOS>
Giving
her
a
strict
charge
to
be
careful
of
her
manner
,
and
only
to
carry
in
my
card
and
say
I
waited
,
I
sat
down
in
the
drawing
-
room
(
which
we
had
now
reached
)
until
she
should
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
Its
former
pleasant
air
of
occupation
was
gone
,
and
the
shutters
were
half
closed
.
 
<EOS>
The
harp
had
not
been
used
for
many
and
many
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
His
picture
,
as
a
boy
,
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
cabinet
in
which
his
mother
had
kept
his
letters
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
wondered
if
she
ever
read
them
now
;
if
she
would
ever
read
them
more
!
   
<EOS>
The
house
was
so
still
that
I
heard
the
girl
's
light
step
upstairs
.
<EOS>
On
her
return
,
she
brought
a
message
,
to
the
effect
that
Mrs
Steerforth
was
an
invalid
and
could
not
come
down
;
but
that
if
I
would
excuse
her
being
in
her
chamber
,
she
would
be
glad
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
I
stood
before
her
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
in
his
room
;
not
in
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
,
of
course
,
that
she
had
taken
to
occupy
it
,
in
remembrance
of
him
;
and
that
the
many
tokens
of
his
old
sports
and
accomplishments
,
by
which
she
was
surrounded
,
remained
there
,
just
as
he
had
left
them
,
for
the
same
reason
.
 
<EOS>
She
murmured
<EOS>
,
however
,
even
in
her
reception
of
me
,
that
she
was
out
of
her
own
chamber
because
its
aspect
was
unsuited
to
her
infirmity
;
and
with
her
stately
look
repelled
the
least
suspicion
of
the
truth
.
   
<EOS>
At
her
chair
,
as
usual
,
was
Rosa
Dartle
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
first
moment
of
her
dark
eyes
resting
on
me
,
I
saw
she
knew
I
was
the
bearer
of
evil
tidings
.
 
<EOS>
The
scar
sprung
into
view
that
instant
.
 
<EOS>
She
withdrew
herself
a
step
behind
the
chair
,
to
keep
her
own
face
out
of
Mrs
Steerforth
's
observation
;
and
scrutinized
me
with
a
piercing
gaze
that
never
faltered
,
never
shrunk
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
observe
you
<EOS>
are
in
mourning
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Steerforth
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
unhappily
a
widower
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
young
to
know
so
great
a
loss
,
"
she
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
grieved
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
grieved
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Time
will
be
good
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
Time
,
"
said
I
,
looking
at
her
,
"
will
be
good
to
all
of
us
.
<EOS>
Dear
Mrs
Steerforth
,
we
must
all
trust
to
that
,
in
our
heaviest
misfortunes
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
earnestness
of
my
manner
,
and
the
tears
in
my
eyes
,
alarmed
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
course
of
her
thoughts
appeared
to
stop
,
and
change
.
   
<EOS>
I
tried
to
command
my
voice
in
gently
saying
his
name
,
but
it
trembled
.
 
<EOS>
She
repeated
it
to
herself
,
two
or
three
times
,
in
a
low
tone
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
addressing
me
,
she
said
,
with
enforced
calmness
:
   
<EOS>
"
My
son
is
ill
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
ill
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
reconciled
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
say
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
could
not
say
No
.
 
<EOS>
She
slightly
turned
her
head
towards
the
spot
where
Rosa
Dartle
had
been
standing
at
her
elbow
,
and
in
that
moment
I
said
,
by
the
motion
of
my
lips
,
to
Rosa
,
"
Dead
!
"
   
<EOS>
That
Mrs
Steerforth
might
not
be
induced
to
look
behind
her
,
and
read
,
plainly
written
,
what
she
was
not
yet
prepared
to
know
,
I
met
her
look
quickly
;
but
I
had
seen
Rosa
Dartle
throw
her
hands
up
in
the
air
with
vehemence
of
despair
and
horror
,
and
then
clasp
them
on
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
The
handsome
lady
---
<EOS>
so
like
,
<EOS>
oh
so
like
!
---
regarded
me
with
a
fixed
look
,
and
put
her
hand
to
her
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
I
besought
her
to
be
calm
,
and
prepare
herself
to
bear
what
I
had
to
tell
;
but
I
should
rather
have
entreated
her
to
weep
,
for
she
sat
like
a
stone
figure
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
was
last
here
,
"
I
faltered
,
"
Miss
Dartle
told
me
he
was
sailing
here
and
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
before
last
was
a
dreadful
one
at
sea
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
were
at
sea
that
night
,
and
near
a
dangerous
coast
,
as
it
is
said
he
was
;
and
if
the
vessel
that
was
seen
should
really
be
the
ship
which
---
"
   
"
Rosa
!
"
said
Mrs
Steerforth
,
"
come
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
came
,
but
with
no
sympathy
or
gentleness
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eyes
gleamed
like
fire
as
she
confronted
his
mother
,
and
broke
into
a
frightful
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
she
said
,
"
is
your
pride
appeased
,
you
madwoman
?
 
<EOS>
Now
has
he
made
atonement
to
you
---
with
his
life
!
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
?
 
<EOS>
---
His
life
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Steerforth
,
fallen
back
stiffly
in
her
chair
,
and
making
no
sound
but
a
moan
,
cast
her
eyes
upon
her
with
a
wide
stare
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
"
cried
Rosa
,
smiting
herself
passionately
on
the
breast
,
"
look
at
me
!
<EOS>
Moan
,
and
groan
,
and
look
at
me
!
<EOS>
Look
here
!
"
<EOS>
striking
the
scar
,
"
at
your
dead
child
's
handiwork
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
moan
the
mother
uttered
,
from
time
to
time
,
went
to
My
heart
.
<EOS>
Always
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Always
inarticulate
and
stifled
.
 
<EOS>
Always
accompanied
with
an
incapable
motion
of
the
head
,
but
with
no
change
of
face
.
 
<EOS>
Always
proceeding
from
a
rigid
mouth
and
closed
teeth
,
as
if
the
jaw
were
locked
and
the
face
frozen
up
in
pain
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remember
when
he
did
this
?
"
she
proceeded
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remember
when
,
in
his
inheritance
of
your
nature
,
and
in
your
pampering
of
his
pride
and
passion
,
he
did
this
,
and
disfigured
me
for
life
?
 
<EOS>
Look
at
me
,
marked
until
I
die
with
his
high
displeasure
;
and
moan
and
groan
for
what
you
made
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dartle
,
<EOS>
"
I
entreated
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
Heaven
's
sake
---
"
   
"
I
WILL
speak
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
turning
on
me
with
her
lightning
eyes
.
"
<EOS>
Be
silent
,
you
!
<EOS>
Look
at
me
,
I
say
,
proud
mother
of
a
proud
,
false
son
!
<EOS>
Moan
for
your
nurture
of
him
,
moan
for
your
corruption
of
him
,
moan
for
your
loss
of
him
,
moan
for
mine
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
clenched
her
hand
,
and
trembled
through
her
spare
,
worn
figure
,
as
if
her
passion
were
killing
her
by
inches
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
,
resent
his
self
-
will
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
,
injured
by
his
haughty
temper
!
<EOS>
You
,
who
opposed
to
both
,
when
your
hair
was
grey
,
the
qualities
which
made
both
when
you
gave
him
birth
!
<EOS>
YOU
,
who
from
his
cradle
reared
him
to
be
what
he
was
,
and
stunted
what
he
should
have
been
!
<EOS>
Are
you
rewarded
,
now
,
for
your
years
of
trouble
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Miss
Dartle
,
shame
!
<EOS>
Oh
cruel
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
"
she
returned
,
"
I
WILL
speak
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
No
power
on
earth
should
stop
me
,
while
I
was
standing
here
!
<EOS>
Have
I
been
silent
all
these
years
,
and
shall
I
not
speak
now
?
 
<EOS>
I
loved
him
better
than
you
ever
loved
him
!
"
<EOS>
turning
on
her
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
have
loved
him
,
and
asked
no
return
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
his
wife
,
I
could
have
been
the
slave
of
his
caprices
for
a
word
of
love
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
.
 
<EOS>
Who
knows
it
better
than
I
?
 
<EOS>
You
were
exacting
,
proud
,
punctilious
,
selfish
.
 
<EOS>
My
love
would
have
been
devoted
---
would
have
trod
your
paltry
whimpering
under
foot
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
flashing
eyes
,
she
stamped
upon
the
ground
as
if
she
actually
did
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
here
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
striking
the
scar
again
,
with
a
relentless
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
he
grew
into
the
better
understanding
of
what
he
had
done
,
he
saw
it
,
and
repented
of
it
!
<EOS>
I
could
sing
to
him
,
and
talk
to
him
,
and
show
the
ardour
that
I
felt
in
all
he
did
,
and
attain
with
labour
to
such
knowledge
as
most
interested
him
;
and
I
attracted
him
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
freshest
and
truest
,
he
loved
me
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
he
did
!
<EOS>
Many
a
time
,
when
you
were
put
off
with
a
slight
word
,
he
has
taken
Me
to
his
heart
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
said
it
with
a
taunting
pride
in
the
midst
of
her
frenzy
---
for
it
was
little
less
---
yet
with
an
eager
remembrance
of
it
,
in
which
the
smouldering
embers
of
a
gentler
feeling
kindled
for
the
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
descended
---
as
I
might
have
known
I
should
,
but
that
he
fascinated
me
with
his
boyish
courtship
---
into
a
doll
,
a
trifle
for
the
occupation
of
an
idle
hour
,
to
be
dropped
,
and
taken
up
,
and
trifled
with
,
as
the
inconstant
humour
took
him
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
grew
weary
,
I
grew
weary
.
 
<EOS>
As
his
fancy
died
out
,
I
would
no
more
have
tried
to
strengthen
any
power
I
had
,
than
I
would
have
married
him
on
his
being
forced
to
take
me
for
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
We
fell
away
from
one
another
without
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
saw
it
,
and
were
not
sorry
.
<EOS>
Since
then
,
I
have
been
a
mere
disfigured
piece
of
furniture
between
you
both
;
having
no
eyes
,
no
ears
,
no
feelings
,
no
remembrances
.
 
<EOS>
Moan
?
 
<EOS>
Moan
for
what
you
made
him
;
not
for
your
love
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
that
the
time
was
,
when
I
loved
him
better
than
you
ever
did
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
stood
with
her
bright
angry
eyes
confronting
the
wide
stare
,
and
the
set
face
;
and
softened
no
more
,
when
the
moaning
was
repeated
,
than
if
the
face
had
been
a
picture
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dartle
,
"
said
I
,
"
if
you
can
be
so
obdurate
as
not
to
feel
for
this
afflicted
mother

"
   
"
Who
feels
for
me
?
<EOS>
"
she
sharply
retorted
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
sown
this
.
 
<EOS>
Let
her
moan
for
the
harvest
that
she
reaps
today
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
if
his
faults
---
"
I
began
.
   
<EOS>
"
Faults
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
bursting
into
passionate
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
dares
malign
him
?
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
soul
worth
millions
of
the
friends
to
whom
he
stooped
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
one
can
have
loved
him
better
,
no
one
can
hold
him
in
dearer
remembrance
than
I
,
"
I
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
meant
to
say
,
if
you
have
no
compassion
for
his
mother
;
or
if
his
faults
---
you
have
been
bitter
on
them
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
false
,
"
she
cried
,
tearing
her
black
hair
;
"
I
loved
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
---
if
his
faults
can
not
,
"
I
went
on
,
"
be
banished
from
your
remembrance
,
in
such
an
hour
;
look
at
that
figure
,
even
as
one
you
have
never
seen
before
,
and
render
it
some
help
!
"
   
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
the
figure
was
unchanged
,
and
looked
unchangeable
.
<EOS>
Motionless
,
rigid
,
staring
;
moaning
in
the
same
dumb
way
from
time
to
time
,
with
the
same
helpless
motion
of
the
head
;
but
giving
no
other
sign
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Dartle
suddenly
kneeled
down
before
it
,
and
began
to
loosen
the
dress
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
curse
upon
you
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
looking
round
at
me
,
with
a
mingled
expression
of
rage
and
grief
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
in
an
evil
hour
that
you
ever
came
here
!
<EOS>
A
curse
upon
you
!
<EOS>
Go
!
"
   
<EOS>
After
passing
out
of
the
room
,
I
hurried
back
to
ring
the
bell
,
the
sooner
to
alarm
the
servants
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
then
taken
the
impassive
figure
in
her
arms
,
and
,
still
upon
her
knees
,
was
weeping
over
it
,
kissing
it
,
calling
to
it
,
rocking
it
to
and
fro
upon
her
bosom
like
a
child
,
and
trying
every
tender
means
to
rouse
the
dormant
senses
.
 
<EOS>
No
longer
afraid
of
leaving
her
,
I
noiselessly
turned
back
again
;
and
alarmed
the
house
as
I
went
out
.
   
<EOS>
Later
in
the
day
,
I
returned
,
and
we
laid
him
in
his
mother
's
room
.
<EOS>
She
was
just
the
same
,
they
told
me
;
Miss
Dartle
never
left
her
;
doctors
were
in
attendance
,
many
things
had
been
tried
;
but
she
lay
like
a
statue
,
except
for
the
low
sound
now
and
then
.
   
<EOS>
I
went
through
the
dreary
house
,
and
darkened
the
windows
.
 
<EOS>
The
windows
of
the
chamber
where
he
lay
<EOS>
,
I
darkened
last
.
 
<EOS>
I
lifted
up
the
leaden
hand
,
and
held
it
to
my
heart
;
and
all
the
world
seemed
death
and
silence
,
broken
only
by
his
mother
's
moaning
.

<EOS>
The
emigrants
 
One
thing
more
<EOS>
,
I
had
to
do
,
before
yielding
myself
to
the
shock
of
these
emotions
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
,
to
conceal
what
had
occurred
,
from
those
who
were
going
away
;
and
to
dismiss
them
on
their
voyage
in
happy
ignorance
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
,
no
time
was
to
be
lost
.
   
<EOS>
I
took
Mr
Micawber
aside
that
same
night
,
and
confided
to
him
the
task
of
standing
between
Mr
Peggotty
and
intelligence
of
the
late
catastrophe
.
 
<EOS>
He
zealously
undertook
to
do
so
,
and
to
intercept
any
newspaper
through
which
it
might
,
without
such
precautions
,
reach
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
penetrates
to
him
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
striking
himself
on
the
breast
,
"
it
shall
first
pass
through
this
body
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
,
I
must
observe
,
in
his
adaptation
of
himself
to
a
new
state
of
society
,
had
acquired
a
bold
buccaneering
air
,
not
absolutely
lawless
,
but
defensive
and
prompt
.
 
<EOS>
One
might
have
supposed
him
a
child
of
the
wilderness
,
long
accustomed
to
live
out
of
the
confines
of
civilization
,
and
about
to
return
to
his
native
wilds
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
provided
himself
,
among
other
things
,
with
a
complete
suit
of
oilskin
,
and
a
straw
hat
with
a
very
low
crown
,
pitched
or
caulked
on
the
outside
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
rough
clothing
,
with
a
common
mariner
's
telescope
under
his
arm
,
and
a
shrewd
trick
of
casting
up
his
eye
at
the
sky
as
looking
out
for
dirty
weather
,
he
was
far
more
nautical
,
after
his
manner
,
than
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
His
whole
family
,
if
I
may
so
express
it
,
were
cleared
for
action
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
Mrs
Micawber
in
the
closest
and
most
uncompromising
of
bonnets
,
made
fast
under
the
chin
;
and
in
a
shawl
which
tied
her
up
(
as
I
had
been
tied
up
,
when
my
aunt
first
received
me
)
like
a
bundle
,
and
was
secured
behind
at
the
waist
,
in
a
strong
knot
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Micawber
<EOS>
I
found
made
snug
for
stormy
weather
,
in
the
same
manner
;
with
nothing
superfluous
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
Master
Micawber
was
hardly
visible
in
a
Guernsey
shirt
,
and
the
shaggiest
suit
of
slops
I
ever
saw
;
and
the
children
were
done
up
,
like
preserved
meats
,
in
impervious
cases
.
 
<EOS>
Both
Mr
Micawber
and
his
eldest
son
wore
their
sleeves
loosely
turned
back
at
the
wrists
,
as
being
ready
to
lend
a
hand
in
any
direction
,
and
to
"
tumble
up
"
,
or
sing
out
,
"

"
<EOS>
on
the
shortest
notice
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
Traddles
and
<EOS>
I
found
them
at
nightfall
,
assembled
on
the
wooden
steps
,
at
that
time
known
as
Hungerford
Stairs
,
watching
the
departure
of
a
boat
with
some
of
their
property
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
told
Traddles
of
the
terrible
event
,
and
it
had
greatly
shocked
him
;
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
kindness
of
keeping
it
a
secret
,
and
he
had
come
to
help
me
in
this
last
service
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
here
that
I
took
Mr
Micawber
aside
,
and
received
his
promise
.
   
<EOS>
The
Micawber
family
were
lodged
in
a
little
,
dirty
,
tumble
-
down
public
-
house
,
which
in
those
days
was
close
to
the
stairs
,
and
whose
protruding
wooden
rooms
overhung
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
The
family
,
as
emigrants
,
being
objects
of
some
interest
in
and
about
Hungerford
,
attracted
so
many
beholders
,
that
we
were
glad
to
take
refuge
in
their
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
the
wooden
chambers
upstairs
,
with
the
tide
flowing
underneath
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
and
Agnes
were
there
,
busily
making
some
little
extra
comforts
,
in
the
way
of
dress
,
for
the
children
.
 
<EOS>
Peggotty
was
quietly
assisting
,
with
the
old
insensible
work
-
box
,
yard
-
measure
,
and
bit
of
wax
-
candle
before
her
,
that
had
now
outlived
so
much
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
easy
to
answer
her
inquiries
;
still
less
to
whisper
Mr
Peggotty
,
when
Mr
Micawber
brought
him
in
,
that
I
had
given
the
letter
,
and
all
was
well
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
did
both
,
and
made
them
happy
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
showed
any
trace
of
what
I
felt
,
my
own
sorrows
were
sufficient
to
account
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
does
the
ship
sail
,
Mr
Micawber
?
"
asked
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
considered
it
necessary
to
prepare
either
my
aunt
or
his
wife
,
by
degrees
,
and
said
,
sooner
than
he
had
expected
yesterday
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
boat
brought
you
word
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
did
,
ma'am
,
"
he
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
she
sails
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
Madam
,
"
he
replied
,
"
I
am
informed
that
we
must
positively
be
on
board
before
seven
tomorrow
morning
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Heyday
!
<EOS>
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
that
's
soon
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
a
sea
-
going
fact
,
Mr
Peggotty
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
<EOS>
so
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
She
'll
drop
down
the
river
with
that
theer
tide
.
<EOS>
If
Mas'r
Davy
and
my
sister
comes
aboard
at
Gravesen
'
,
arternoon
o
'
<EOS>
next
day
,
they
'll
see
the
last
on
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
that
we
shall
do
,
"
said
I
,
"
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Until
then
,
and
until
we
are
at
sea
,
"
observed
Mr
Micawber
,
with
a
glance
of
intelligence
at
me
,
"
Mr
Peggotty
and
myself
will
constantly
keep
a
double
look
-
out
together
,
on
our
goods
and
chattels
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
,
my
love
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
clearing
his
throat
in
his
magnificent
way
,
"
my
friend
Mr
Thomas
Traddles
is
so
obliging
as
to
solicit
,
<EOS>
in
my
ear
,
that
he
should
have
the
privilege
of
ordering
the
ingredients
necessary
to
the
composition
of
a
moderate
portion
of
that
Beverage
which
is
peculiarly
associated
,
in
our
minds
,
with
the
Roast
Beef
of
Old
England
.
 
<EOS>
I
allude
to
---
in
short
,
Punch
.
 
<EOS>
Under
ordinary
circumstances
,
I
should
scruple
to
entreat
the
indulgence
of
Miss
Trotwood
and
Miss
Wickfield
,
but
---
"
   
"
I
can
only
say
for
myself
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
that
I
will
drink
all
happiness
and
success
to
you
,
Mr
Micawber
,
with
the
utmost
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
too
!
"
said
Agnes
,
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
immediately
descended
to
the
bar
,
where
he
appeared
to
be
quite
at
home
;
and
in
due
time
returned
with
a
steaming
jug
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
observe
that
he
had
been
peeling
the
lemons
with
his
own
clasp
-
knife
,
which
,
as
became
the
knife
of
a
practical
settler
,
was
about
a
foot
long
;
and
which
he
wiped
,
not
wholly
without
ostentation
,
on
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
and
the
two
elder
members
of
the
family
<EOS>
I
now
found
to
be
provided
with
similar
formidable
instruments
,
while
every
child
had
its
own
wooden
spoon
attached
to
its
body
by
a
strong
line
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
similar
anticipation
of
life
afloat
,
and
in
the
Bush
,
Mr
Micawber
,
instead
of
helping
Mrs
Micawber
and
his
eldest
son
and
daughter
to
punch
,
in
wine
-
glasses
,
which
he
might
easily
have
done
,
for
there
was
a
shelf
-
full
in
the
room
,
served
it
out
to
them
in
a
series
of
villainous
little
tin
pots
;
and
I
never
saw
him
enjoy
anything
so
much
as
drinking
out
of
his
own
particular
pint
pot
,
and
putting
it
in
his
pocket
at
the
close
of
the
evening
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
luxuries
of
the
old
country
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
with
an
intense
satisfaction
in
their
renouncement
,
"
we
abandon
.
 
<EOS>
The
denizens
of
the
forest
can
not
,
of
course
,
expect
to
participate
in
the
refinements
of
the
land
of
the
Free
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
,
a
boy
came
in
to
say
that
Mr
Micawber
was
wanted
downstairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
presentiment
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
setting
down
her
tin
pot
,
"
that
it
is
a
member
of
my
family
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
so
,
my
dear
,
"
observed
Mr
Micawber
,
with
his
usual
suddenness
of
warmth
on
that
subject
,
"
as
the
member
of
your
family
---
whoever
he
,
she
,
or
it
,
may
be

has
kept
us
waiting
for
a
considerable
period
,
perhaps
the
Member
may
now
wait
MY
convenience
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Micawber
,
"
said
his
wife
,
in
a
low
tone
,
"
at
such
a
time
as
this
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
meet
,
"
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
rising
,
"
"
that
every
nice
offence
should
bear
its
comment
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Emma
,
I
stand
reproved
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
loss
,
Micawber
,
"
observed
his
wife
,
"
has
been
my
family
's
,
not
yours

<EOS>
If
my
family
are
at
length
sensible
of
the
deprivation
to
which
their
own
conduct
has
,
in
the
past
,
exposed
them
,
and
now
desire
to
extend
the
hand
of
fellowship
,
let
it
not
be
repulsed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
he
returned
,
"
so
be
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
not
for
their
sakes
;
for
mine
,
Micawber
,
"
said
his
wife
.
   
<EOS>
"
Emma
,
"
he
returned
,
"
that
view
of
the
question
is
,
at
such
a
moment
,
irresistible
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
even
now
,
distinctly
pledge
myself
to
fall
upon
your
family
's
neck
;
but
the
member
of
your
family
,
who
is
now
in
attendance
,
shall
have
no
genial
warmth
frozen
by
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
withdrew
,
and
was
absent
some
little
time
;
in
the
course
of
which
Mrs
Micawber
was
not
wholly
free
from
an
apprehension
that
words
might
have
arisen
between
him
and
the
Member
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
the
same
boy
reappeared
,
and
presented
me
with
a
note
written
in
pencil
,
and
headed
,
in
a
legal
manner
,
"
Heep
v
Micawber
"
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
document
,
I
learned
that
Mr
Micawber
being
again
arrested
,
was
in
a
final
paroxysm
of
despair
;
and
that
he
begged
me
to
send
him
his
knife
and
pint
pot
,
by
bearer
,
as
they
might
prove
serviceable
during
the
brief
remainder
of
his
existence
,
in
jail
.
 
<EOS>
He
also
requested
,
as
a
last
act
of
friendship
,
that
I
would
see
his
family
to
the
Parish
Workhouse
,
and
forget
that
such
a
Being
ever
lived
.
   
<EOS>
Of
course
I
answered
this
note
by
going
down
with
the
boy
to
pay
the
money
,
where
I
found
Mr
Micawber
sitting
in
a
corner
,
looking
darkly
at
the
Sheriff
's
Officer
who
had
effected
the
capture
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
release
,
he
embraced
me
with
the
utmost
fervour
;
and
made
an
entry
of
the
transaction
in
his
pocket
-
book
---
being
very
particular
,
I
recollect
,
about
a
halfpenny
I
inadvertently
omitted
from
my
statement
of
the
total
.
   
<EOS>
This
momentous
pocket
-
book
was
a
timely
reminder
to
him
of
another
transaction
.
 
<EOS>
On
our
return
to
the
room
upstairs
(
where
he
accounted
for
his
absence
by
saying
that
it
had
been
occasioned
by
circumstances
over
which
he
had
no
control
)
,
he
took
out
of
it
a
large
sheet
of
paper
,
folded
small
,
and
quite
covered
with
long
sums
,
carefully
worked
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
glimpse
I
had
of
them
,
I
should
say
that
I
never
saw
such
sums
out
of
a
school
ciphering
-
book
.
<EOS>
These
,
it
seemed
,
were
calculations
of
compound
interest
on
what
he
called
"
the
principal
amount
of
forty
-
one
,
ten
,
eleven
and
a
half
"
,
for
various
periods
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
careful
consideration
of
these
,
and
an
elaborate
estimate
of
his
resources
,
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
to
select
that
sum
which
represented
the
amount
with
compound
interest
to
two
years
,
fifteen
calendar
months
,
and
fourteen
days
,
from
that
date
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
he
had
drawn
a
note
-
of
-
hand
with
great
neatness
,
which
he
handed
over
to
Traddles
on
the
spot
,
a
discharge
of
his
debt
in
full
(
as
between
man
and
man
)
,
with
many
acknowledgements
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
still
a
presentiment
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
pensively
shaking
her
head
,
"
that
my
family
will
appear
on
board
,
before
we
finally
depart
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
evidently
had
his
presentiment
on
the
subject
too
,
but
he
put
it
in
his
tin
pot
and
swallowed
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
any
opportunity
of
sending
letters
home
,
on
your
passage
,
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
you
must
let
us
hear
from
you
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Miss
Trotwood
,
"
she
replied
,
"
I
shall
only
be
too
happy
to
think
that
anyone
expects
to
hear
from
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
not
fail
to
correspond
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
I
trust
,
as
an
old
and
familiar
friend
,
will
not
object
to
receive
occasional
intelligence
,
himself
,
from
one
who
knew
him
when
the
twins
were
yet
unconscious
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
said
that
I
should
hope
to
hear
,
whenever
she
had
an
opportunity
of
writing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Please
Heaven
,
there
will
be
many
such
opportunities
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
ocean
,
in
these
times
,
is
a
perfect
fleet
of
ships
;
and
we
can
hardly
fail
to
encounter
many
,
in
running
over
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
merely
crossing
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
trifling
with
his
eye
-
glass
,
"
merely
crossing
.
 
<EOS>
The
distance
is
quite
imaginary
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
think
,
now
,
how
odd
it
was
,
<EOS>
but
how
wonderfully
like
Mr
Micawber
<EOS>
,
that
,
when
he
went
from
London
to
Canterbury
,
he
should
have
talked
as
if
he
were
going
to
the
farthest
limits
of
the
earth
;
and
,
when
he
went
from
England
to
Australia
,
as
if
he
were
going
for
a
little
trip
across
the
channel
.
   
<EOS>
"
On
the
voyage
,
I
shall
endeavour
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
"
occasionally
to
spin
them
a
yarn
;
and
the
melody
of
my
son
Wilkins
will
,
I
trust
,
be
acceptable
at
the
galley
-
fire
.
 
<EOS>
When
Mrs
Micawber
has
her
sea
-
legs
on
---
an
expression
in
which
I
hope
there
is
no
conventional
impropriety
---
she
will
give
them
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
"
<EOS>
Little
Tafflin
"
.
 
<EOS>
Porpoises
and
dolphins
,
I
believe
,
will
be
frequently
observed
athwart
our
Bows
;
and
,
either
on
the
starboard
or
the
larboard
quarter
,
objects
of
interest
will
be
continually
descried
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
with
the
old
genteel
air
,
"
the
probability
is
,
all
will
be
found
so
exciting
,
alow
and
aloft
,
that
when
the
lookout
,
stationed
in
the
main
-
top
,
cries
Land
<EOS>
-
oh
!
<EOS>
we
shall
be
very
considerably
astonished
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
he
flourished
off
the
contents
of
his
little
tin
pot
,
as
if
he
had
made
the
voyage
,
and
had
passed
a
first
-
class
examination
before
the
highest
naval
authorities
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
I
chiefly
hope
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
is
,
that
in
some
branches
of
our
family
we
may
live
again
in
the
old
country
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
frown
,
Micawber
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
now
refer
to
my
own
family
,
but
to
our
children
's
children
.
 
<EOS>
However
vigorous
the
sapling
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
shaking
her
head
,
"
I
can
not
forget
the
parent
-
tree
;
and
<EOS>
when
our
race
attains
to
eminence
and
fortune
,
I
own
I
should
wish
that
fortune
to
flow
into
the
coffers
of
Britannia
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Micawber
,
<EOS>
"
Britannia
must
take
her
chance
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
bound
to
say
that
she
has
never
done
much
for
me
,
and
that
I
have
no
particular
wish
upon
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Micawber
,
"
returned
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
there
,
you
are
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
going
out
,
Micawber
,
to
this
distant
clime
,
to
strengthen
,
not
to
weaken
,
the
connexion
between
yourself
and
Albion
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
connexion
in
question
,
my
love
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Micawber
,
"
has
not
laid
me
<EOS>
,
I
repeat
,
under
that
load
of
personal
obligation
,
that
I
am
at
all
sensitive
as
to
the
formation
of
another
connexion

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Micawber
,
"
returned
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
,
I
again
say
,
you
are
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
your
power
,
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
that
which
will
strengthen
,
even
in
this
step
you
are
about
to
take
,
the
connexion
between
yourself
and
Albion
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
sat
in
his
elbow
-
chair
,
with
his
eyebrows
raised
;
half
receiving
and
half
repudiating
Mrs
Micawber
's
views
as
they
were
stated
,
but
very
sensible
of
their
foresight
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
I
wish
Mr
Micawber
to
feel
his
position
.
 
<EOS>
It
appears
to
me
highly
important
that
Mr
Micawber
should
,
from
the
hour
of
his
embarkation
,
feel
his
position
.
 
<EOS>
Your
old
knowledge
of
me
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
will
have
told
you
that
I
have
not
the
sanguine
disposition
of
Mr
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
My
disposition
is
,
if
I
may
say
so
,
eminently
practical
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
this
is
a
long
voyage
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
it
will
involve
many
privations
and
inconveniences
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
shut
my
eyes
to
those
facts
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
also
know
what
Mr
Micawber
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
latent
power
of
Mr
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
And
therefore
I
consider
it
vitally
important
that
Mr
Micawber
should
feel
his
position
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
"
he
observed
,
"
perhaps
you
will
allow
me
to
remark
that
it
is
barely
possible
that
I
DO
feel
my
position
at
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
Micawber
,
"
she
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
fully
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
Mr
Micawber
's
is
not
a
common
case
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
is
going
to
a
distant
country
expressly
in
order
that
he
may
be
fully
understood
and
appreciated
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
Mr
Micawber
to
take
his
stand
upon
that
vessel
's
prow
,
and
firmly
say
,
"
This
country
I
am
come
to
conquer
!
<EOS>
Have
you
honours
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
riches
?
<EOS>
Have
you
posts
of
profitable
pecuniary
emolument
?
 
<EOS>
Let
them
be
brought
forward
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
mine
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
Mr
Micawber
,
glancing
at
us
all
,
seemed
to
think
there
was
a
good
deal
in
this
idea
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
Mr
Micawber
,
if
I
make
myself
understood
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
in
her
argumentative
tone
,
"
to
be
the
Caesar
of
his
own
fortunes
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
my
dear
Mr
Copperfield
,
appears
to
me
to
be
his
true
position
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
first
moment
of
this
voyage
,
I
wish
Mr
Micawber
to
stand
upon
that
vessel
's
prow
and
say
,
"
Enough
of
delay
:
enough
of
disappointment
:
enough
of
limited
means
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
in
the
old
country
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
new
.
 
<EOS>
Produce
your
reparation
.
<EOS>
Bring
it
forward
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
folded
his
arms
in
a
resolute
manner
,
as
if
he
were
then
stationed
on
the
figure
-
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
doing
that
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
---
feeling
his
position
---
am
I
not
right
in
saying
that
Mr
Micawber
will
strengthen
,
and
not
weaken
,
his
connexion
with
Britain
?
 
<EOS>
An
important
public
character
arising
in
that
hemisphere
,
shall
I
be
told
that
its
influence
will
not
be
felt
at
home
?
 
<EOS>
Can
I
be
so
weak
as
to
imagine
that
Mr
Micawber
,
wielding
the
rod
of
talent
and
of
power
in
Australia
,
will
be
nothing
in
England
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
but
a
woman
;
but
I
should
be
unworthy
of
myself
and
of
my
papa
,
if
I
were
guilty
of
such
absurd
weakness
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Micawber
's
conviction
that
her
arguments
were
unanswerable
,
gave
a
moral
elevation
to
her
tone
which
I
think
I
had
never
heard
in
it
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
therefore
it
is
,
"
said
Mrs
Micawber
,
"
that
I
the
more
wish
,
that
,
at
a
future
period
,
we
may
live
again
on
the
parent
soil
.
<EOS>
Mr
Micawber
may
be
---
I
can
not
disguise
from
myself
that
the
probability
is
,
Mr
Micawber
will
be
---
a
page
of
History
;
and
he
ought
then
to
be
represented
in
the
country
which
gave
him
birth
,
and
did
NOT
give
him
employment
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
"
observed
Mr
Micawber
,
"
it
is
impossible
for
me
not
to
be
touched
by
your
affection
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
always
willing
to
defer
to
your
good
sense
.
 
<EOS>
What
will
be
---
will
be
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
that
I
should
grudge
my
native
country
any
portion
of
the
wealth
that
may
be
accumulated
by
our
descendants
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
well
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
nodding
towards
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
and
I
drink
my
love
to
you
all
,
and
every
blessing
and
success
attend
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
put
down
the
two
children
he
had
been
nursing
,
one
on
each
knee
,
to
join
Mr
and
Mrs
Micawber
in
drinking
to
all
of
us
in
return
;
and
when
he
and
the
Micawbers
cordially
shook
hands
as
comrades
,
and
his
brown
face
brightened
with
a
smile
,
I
felt
that
he
would
make
his
way
,
establish
a
good
name
,
and
be
beloved
,
go
where
he
would
.
   
<EOS>
Even
the
children
were
instructed
,
each
to
dip
a
wooden
spoon
into
Mr
Micawber
's
pot
,
and
pledge
us
in
its
contents
.
 
<EOS>
When
this
was
done
,
my
aunt
and
Agnes
rose
,
and
parted
from
the
emigrants
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
sorrowful
farewell
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
all
crying
;
the
children
hung
about
Agnes
to
the
last
;
and
we
left
poor
Mrs
Micawber
in
a
very
distressed
condition
,
sobbing
and
weeping
by
a
dim
candle
,
that
must
have
made
the
room
look
,
from
the
river
,
like
a
miserable
light
-
house
.
   
<EOS>
I
went
down
again
next
morning
to
see
that
they
were
away
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
departed
,
in
a
boat
,
as
early
as
five
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
wonderful
instance
to
me
of
the
gap
such
partings
make
,
<EOS>
that
although
my
association
of
them
with
the
tumble
-
down
public
-
house
and
the
wooden
stairs
dated
only
from
last
night
,
both
seemed
dreary
and
deserted
,
now
that
they
were
gone
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
,
my
old
nurse
and
I
went
down
to
Gravesend
.
 
<EOS>
We
found
the
ship
in
the
river
,
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
boats
;
a
favourable
wind
blowing
;
the
signal
for
sailing
at
her
mast
-
head
.
 
<EOS>
I
hired
a
boat
directly
,
and
we
put
off
to
her
;
and
getting
through
the
little
vortex
of
confusion
of
which
she
was
the
centre
,
went
on
board
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
was
waiting
for
us
on
deck
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
that
Mr
Micawber
had
just
now
been
arrested
again
(
and
for
the
last
time
)
at
the
suit
of
Heep
,
and
that
,
in
compliance
with
a
request
I
had
made
to
him
,
he
had
paid
the
money
,
which
I
repaid
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
took
us
down
between
decks
;
and
there
,
<EOS>
any
lingering
fears
I
had
of
his
having
heard
any
rumours
of
what
had
happened
,
were
dispelled
by
Mr
Micawber
's
coming
out
of
the
gloom
,
taking
his
arm
with
an
air
of
friendship
and
protection
,
and
telling
me
that
they
had
scarcely
been
asunder
for
a
moment
,
since
the
night
before
last
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
such
a
strange
scene
to
me
,
and
so
confined
and
dark
,
that
,
at
first
,
I
could
make
out
hardly
anything
;
but
,
by
degrees
,
it
cleared
,
as
my
eyes
became
more
accustomed
to
the
gloom
,
and
I
seemed
to
stand
in
a
picture
by
OSTADE
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
great
beams
,
bulks
,
and
ringbolts
of
the
ship
,
and
the
emigrant
-
berths
,
and
chests
,
and
bundles
,
and
barrels
,
and
heaps
of
miscellaneous
baggage
---
lighted
up
,
here
and
there
,
by
dangling
lanterns
;
and
elsewhere
by
the
yellow
daylight
straying
down
a
windsail
or
a
hatchway
---
were
crowded
groups
of
people
,
making
new
friendships
,
taking
leave
of
one
another
,
talking
,
laughing
,
crying
,
eating
and
drinking
;
some
,
already
settled
down
into
the
possession
of
their
few
feet
of
space
,
with
their
little
households
arranged
,
and
tiny
children
established
on
stools
,
or
in
dwarf
elbow
-
chairs
;
others
,
despairing
of
a
resting
-
place
,
and
wandering
disconsolately
.
 
<EOS>
From
babies
who
had
but
a
week
or
two
of
life
behind
them
,
to
crooked
old
men
and
women
who
seemed
to
have
but
<EOS>
a
week
or
two
of
life
before
them
;
and
from
ploughmen
bodily
carrying
out
soil
of
England
on
their
boots
,
to
smiths
taking
away
samples
of
its
soot
and
smoke
upon
their
skins
;
every
age
and
occupation
appeared
to
be
crammed
into
the
narrow
compass
of
the
'
tween
decks
.
   
<EOS>
As
my
eye
glanced
round
this
place
,
I
thought
I
saw
sitting
,
by
an
open
port
,
with
one
of
the
Micawber
children
near
her
,
a
figure
like
Emily
's
;
it
first
attracted
my
attention
,
by
another
figure
parting
from
it
with
a
kiss
;
and
as
it
glided
calmly
away
through
the
disorder
,
reminding
me
of
---
Agnes
!
<EOS>
But
in
the
rapid
motion
and
confusion
,
and
in
the
unsettlement
of
my
own
thoughts
,
I
lost
it
again
;
and
only
knew
that
the
time
was
come
when
all
visitors
were
being
warned
to
leave
the
ship
;
that
my
nurse
was
crying
on
a
chest
beside
me
;
and
that
Mrs
Gummidge
,
assisted
by
some
younger
stooping
woman
in
black
,
was
busily
arranging
Mr
Peggotty
's
goods
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
last
wured
,
Mas'r
Davy
?
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
one
forgotten
thing
<EOS>
afore
we
parts
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
One
thing
!
<EOS>
"
said
I.
 
"
Martha
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
touched
the
younger
woman
I
have
mentioned
on
the
shoulder
,
and
Martha
stood
before
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Heaven
bless
you
,
you
good
man
!
"
<EOS>
cried
I.
 
<EOS>
"
You
take
her
with
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
answered
for
him
,
with
a
burst
of
tears
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
speak
no
more
at
that
time
,
but
I
wrung
his
hand
;
and
if
ever
I
have
loved
and
honoured
any
man
,
I
loved
and
honoured
that
man
in
my
soul
.
   
<EOS>
The
ship
was
clearing
fast
of
strangers
.
 
<EOS>
The
greatest
trial
that
I
had
,
remained
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
what
the
noble
spirit
that
was
gone
,
had
given
me
in
charge
to
say
at
parting
.
 
<EOS>
It
moved
him
deeply
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
charged
me
,
in
return
,
with
many
messages
of
affection
and
regret
for
those
deaf
ears
,
he
moved
me
more
.
   
<EOS>
The
time
was
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
embraced
him
,
took
my
weeping
nurse
upon
my
arm
,
and
hurried
away
.
 
<EOS>
On
deck
,
I
took
leave
of
poor
Mrs
Micawber
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
looking
distractedly
about
for
her
family
,
even
then
;
and
her
last
words
to
me
were
,
that
she
never
would
desert
Mr
Micawber
.
   
<EOS>
We
went
over
the
side
into
our
boat
,
and
lay
at
a
little
distance
,
to
see
the
ship
wafted
on
her
course
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
then
calm
,
radiant
sunset
.
 
<EOS>
She
lay
between
us
,
and
the
red
light
;
and
every
taper
line
and
spar
was
visible
against
the
glow
.
 
<EOS>
A
sight
at
once
so
beautiful
,
so
mournful
,
and
so
hopeful
,
as
the
glorious
ship
,
lying
,
still
,
on
the
flushed
water
,
with
all
the
life
on
board
her
crowded
at
the
bulwarks
,
and
there
clustering
,
for
a
moment
,
bare
-
headed
and
silent
,
I
never
saw
.
   
<EOS>
Silent
,
only
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
sails
rose
to
the
wind
,
and
the
ship
began
to
move
,
there
broke
from
all
the
boats
three
resounding
cheers
,
which
those
on
board
took
up
,
and
echoed
back
,
and
which
were
echoed
and
re
-
echoed
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
burst
out
when
I
heard
the
sound
,
and
beheld
the
waving
of
the
hats
and
handkerchiefs
---
<EOS>
and
then
I
saw
her
!
   
<EOS>
Then
I
saw
her
,
at
her
uncle
's
side
,
and
trembling
on
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
pointed
to
us
with
an
eager
hand
;
and
she
saw
us
,
and
waved
her
last
good
-
bye
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Aye
,
Emily
,
beautiful
and
drooping
,
cling
to
him
with
the
utmost
trust
of
thy
bruised
heart
;
for
he
has
clung
to
thee
,
with
all
the
might
of
his
great
love
!
   
<EOS>
Surrounded
by
the
rosy
light
,
and
standing
high
upon
the
deck
,
apart
together
,
she
clinging
to
him
,
and
he
holding
her
,
they
solemnly
passed
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
had
fallen
on
the
Kentish
hills
when
we
were
rowed
ashore
---
and
fallen
darkly
upon
me
.
      
<EOS>
Chapter
58
.
<EOS>
Absence
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
and
gloomy
night
that
gathered
on
me
,
haunted
by
the
ghosts
of
many
hopes
,
of
many
dear
remembrances
,
many
errors
,
many
unavailing
sorrows
and
regrets
.
   
<EOS>
I
went
away
from
England
;
not
knowing
,
even
then
,
how
great
the
shock
was
,
that
I
had
to
bear
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
all
who
were
dear
to
me
,
and
went
away
;
and
believed
that
I
had
borne
it
,
and
it
was
past
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
man
upon
a
field
of
battle
will
receive
a
mortal
hurt
,
and
scarcely
know
that
he
is
struck
,
so
I
,
when
I
was
left
alone
with
my
undisciplined
heart
,
had
no
conception
of
the
wound
with
which
it
had
to
strive
.
   
<EOS>
The
knowledge
came
upon
me
,
not
quickly
,
but
little
by
little
,
and
grain
by
grain
.
 
<EOS>
The
desolate
feeling
with
which
I
went
abroad
,
deepened
and
widened
hourly
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
it
was
a
heavy
sense
of
loss
and
sorrow
,
wherein
I
could
distinguish
little
else
.
 
<EOS>
By
imperceptible
degrees
,
it
became
a
hopeless
consciousness
of
all
that
I
had
lost
---
love
,
friendship
,
interest
;
of
all
that
had
been
shattered
---
my
first
trust
,
my
first
affection
,
the
whole
airy
castle
of
my
life
;
of
all
that
remained
---
a
ruined
blank
and
waste
,
lying
wide
around
me
,
unbroken
,
to
the
dark
horizon
.
   
<EOS>
If
my
grief
were
selfish
,
I
did
not
know
it
to
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
mourned
for
my
child
-
wife
,
taken
from
her
blooming
world
,
so
young
.
 
<EOS>
I
mourned
for
him
who
might
have
won
the
love
and
admiration
of
thousands
,
as
he
had
won
mine
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
I
mourned
for
the
broken
heart
that
had
found
rest
in
the
stormy
sea
;
and
for
the
wandering
remnants
of
the
simple
home
,
where
I
had
heard
the
night
-
wind
blowing
,
when
I
was
a
child
.
   
<EOS>
From
the
accumulated
sadness
into
which
I
fell
,
I
had
at
length
no
hope
of
ever
issuing
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
roamed
from
place
to
place
,
carrying
my
burden
with
me
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
its
whole
weight
now
;
and
I
drooped
beneath
it
,
and
I
said
in
my
heart
that
it
could
never
be
lightened
.
   
<EOS>
When
this
despondency
was
at
its
worst
,
I
believed
that
I
should
die
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
I
thought
that
I
would
like
to
die
at
home
;
and
actually
turned
back
on
my
road
,
that
I
might
get
there
soon
.
 
<EOS>
At
other
times
,
I
passed
on
farther
away
,
---
from
city
to
city
,
seeking
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
,
and
trying
to
leave
<EOS>
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
behind
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
not
in
my
power
to
retrace
,
one
by
one
,
all
the
weary
phases
of
distress
of
mind
through
which
I
passed
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
some
dreams
that
can
only
be
imperfectly
and
vaguely
described
;
and
when
I
oblige
myself
to
look
back
on
this
time
of
my
life
,
I
seem
to
be
recalling
such
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
myself
passing
on
among
the
novelties
of
foreign
towns
,
palaces
,
cathedrals
,
temples
,
pictures
,
castles
,
tombs
,
fantastic
streets
---
the
old
abiding
places
of
History
and
Fancy
---
as
a
dreamer
might
;
bearing
my
painful
load
through
all
,
and
hardly
conscious
of
the
objects
as
they
fade
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
Listlessness
to
everything
,
but
brooding
sorrow
,
was
the
night
that
fell
on
my
undisciplined
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
look
up
from
it
---
as
at
last
<EOS>
I
did
,
thank
Heaven
!
<EOS>
---
and
from
its
long
,
sad
,
wretched
dream
,
to
dawn
.
   
<EOS>
For
many
months
I
travelled
with
this
ever
-
darkening
cloud
upon
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Some
blind
reasons
that
I
had
for
not
returning
home
---
reasons
then
struggling
within
me
,
vainly
,
for
more
distinct
expression
---
kept
me
on
my
pilgrimage
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
I
had
proceeded
restlessly
from
place
to
place
,
stopping
nowhere
;
sometimes
,
I
had
lingered
long
in
one
spot
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
had
no
purpose
,
no
sustaining
soul
within
me
,
anywhere
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
in
Switzerland
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
come
out
of
Italy
,
over
one
of
the
great
passes
of
the
Alps
,
and
had
since
wandered
with
a
guide
among
the
by
-
ways
of
the
mountains
.
 
<EOS>
If
those
awful
solitudes
had
spoken
to
my
heart
,
I
did
not
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
found
sublimity
and
wonder
in
the
dread
heights
and
precipices
,
in
the
roaring
torrents
,
and
the
wastes
of
ice
and
snow
;
but
as
yet
,
they
had
taught
me
nothing
else
.
   
<EOS>
I
came
,
one
evening
before
sunset
,
down
into
a
valley
,
where
I
was
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
my
descent
to
it
,
by
the
winding
track
along
the
mountain
-
side
,
from
which
I
saw
it
shining
far
below
,
I
think
some
long
-
unwonted
sense
of
beauty
and
tranquillity
,
some
softening
influence
awakened
by
its
peace
,
moved
faintly
in
my
breast
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
pausing
once
,
with
a
kind
of
sorrow
that
was
not
all
oppressive
,
not
quite
despairing
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
almost
hoping
that
some
better
change
was
possible
within
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
came
into
the
valley
,
as
the
evening
sun
was
shining
on
the
remote
heights
of
snow
,
that
closed
it
in
,
like
eternal
clouds
.
<EOS>
The
bases
of
the
mountains
forming
the
gorge
in
which
the
little
village
lay
,
were
richly
green
;
and
high
above
this
gentler
vegetation
,
grew
forests
of
dark
fir
,
cleaving
the
wintry
snow
-
drift
,
wedge
-
like
,
and
stemming
the
avalanche
.
 
<EOS>
Above
these
,
were
range
upon
range
of
craggy
steeps
,
grey
rock
,
bright
ice
,
and
smooth
verdure
-
specks
of
pasture
,
all
gradually
blending
with
the
crowning
snow
.
 
<EOS>
Dotted
here
and
there
on
the
mountain's
-
side
,
each
tiny
dot
a
home
,
were
lonely
wooden
cottages
,
<EOS>
so
dwarfed
by
the
towering
heights
that
they
appeared
too
small
for
toys
.
 
<EOS>
So
did
even
the
clustered
village
in
the
valley
,
with
its
wooden
bridge
across
the
stream
,
where
the
stream
tumbled
over
broken
rocks
,
and
roared
away
among
the
trees
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
quiet
air
,
there
was
a
sound
of
distant
singing
---
shepherd
voices
;
but
,
as
one
bright
evening
cloud
floated
midway
along
the
mountain's
-
side
,
I
could
almost
have
believed
it
came
from
there
,
and
was
not
earthly
music
.
 
<EOS>
All
at
once
,
in
this
serenity
,
great
Nature
spoke
to
me
;
and
soothed
me
to
lay
down
my
weary
head
upon
the
grass
,
and
weep
as
I
had
not
wept
yet
,
since
Dora
died
!
   
<EOS>
I
had
found
a
packet
of
letters
awaiting
me
but
a
few
minutes
before
,
and
had
strolled
out
of
the
village
to
read
them
while
my
supper
was
making
ready
.
 
<EOS>
Other
packets
had
missed
me
,
and
I
had
received
none
for
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
Beyond
a
line
or
two
,
to
say
that
I
was
well
,
and
had
arrived
at
such
a
place
,
I
had
not
had
fortitude
or
constancy
to
write
a
letter
since
I
left
home
.
   
<EOS>
The
packet
was
in
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
opened
it
,
and
read
the
writing
of
Agnes
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
happy
and
useful
,
was
prospering
as
she
had
hoped
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
all
she
told
me
of
herself
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
referred
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
She
gave
me
no
advice
;
she
urged
no
duty
on
me
;
she
only
told
me
,
in
her
own
fervent
manner
,
what
her
trust
in
me
was
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
(
she
said
)
<EOS>
how
such
a
nature
as
mine
would
turn
affliction
to
good
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
how
trial
and
emotion
would
exalt
and
strengthen
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
sure
that
in
my
every
purpose
I
should
gain
a
firmer
and
a
higher
tendency
,
through
the
grief
I
had
undergone
.
 
<EOS>
She
,
who
so
gloried
in
my
fame
,
and
so
looked
forward
to
its
augmentation
,
well
knew
that
I
would
labour
on
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
that
in
me
,
sorrow
could
not
be
weakness
,
but
must
be
strength
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
endurance
of
my
childish
days
had
done
its
part
to
make
me
what
I
was
,
so
greater
calamities
would
nerve
me
on
,
to
be
yet
better
than
I
was
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
as
they
had
taught
me
,
would
I
teach
others
.
 
<EOS>
She
commended
me
to
God
,
who
had
taken
my
innocent
darling
to
His
rest
;
and
in
her
sisterly
affection
cherished
me
always
,
and
was
always
at
my
side
go
where
I
would
;
proud
of
what
I
had
done
,
but
infinitely
prouder
yet
of
what
I
was
reserved
to
do
.
   
<EOS>
I
put
the
letter
in
my
breast
,
and
thought
what
had
I
been
an
hour
ago
!
<EOS>
When
I
heard
the
voices
die
away
,
and
saw
the
quiet
evening
cloud
grow
dim
,
and
all
the
colours
in
the
valley
fade
,
and
the
golden
snow
upon
the
mountain
-
tops
become
a
remote
part
of
the
pale
night
sky
,
yet
felt
that
the
night
was
passing
from
my
mind
,
and
all
its
shadows
clearing
,
there
was
no
name
for
the
love
I
bore
her
,
<EOS>
dearer
to
me
,
henceforward
,
than
ever
until
then
.
   
<EOS>
I
read
her
letter
many
times
.
 
<EOS>
I
wrote
to
her
before
I
slept
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
that
I
had
been
in
sore
need
of
her
help
;
that
without
her
I
was
not
,
and
I
never
had
been
,
what
she
thought
me
;
but
that
she
inspired
me
to
be
that
,
and
I
would
try
.
   
<EOS>
I
did
try
.
 
<EOS>
In
three
months
more
,
a
year
would
have
passed
since
the
beginning
of
my
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
determined
to
make
no
resolutions
until
the
expiration
of
those
three
months
,
but
to
try
.
 
<EOS>
I
lived
in
that
valley
,
and
its
neighbourhood
,
all
the
time
.
   
<EOS>
The
three
months
gone
,
I
resolved
to
remain
away
from
home
for
some
time
longer
;
to
settle
myself
for
the
present
in
Switzerland
,
which
was
growing
dear
to
me
in
the
remembrance
of
that
evening
;
to
resume
my
pen
;
to
work
.
   
<EOS>
I
resorted
humbly
whither
Agnes
had
commended
me
;
I
sought
out
Nature
,
never
sought
in
vain
;
and
I
admitted
to
my
breast
the
human
interest
I
had
lately
shrunk
from
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
long
,
before
I
had
almost
as
many
friends
in
the
valley
as
in
Yarmouth
:
<EOS>
and
when
I
left
it
,
before
the
winter
set
in
,
for
Geneva
,
and
came
back
in
the
spring
,
their
cordial
greetings
had
a
homely
sound
to
me
,
although
they
were
not
conveyed
in
English
words
.
   
<EOS>
I
worked
early
and
late
,
patiently
and
hard
.
 
<EOS>
I
wrote
a
Story
,
with
a
purpose
growing
,
not
remotely
,
out
of
my
experience
,
and
sent
it
to
Traddles
,
and
he
arranged
for
its
publication
very
advantageously
for
me
;
and
the
tidings
of
my
growing
reputation
began
to
reach
me
from
travellers
whom
I
encountered
by
chance
.
<EOS>
After
some
rest
and
change
,
I
fell
to
work
,
in
my
old
ardent
way
,
on
a
new
fancy
,
which
took
strong
possession
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
advanced
in
the
execution
of
this
task
,
I
felt
it
more
and
more
,
and
roused
my
utmost
energies
to
do
it
well
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
my
third
work
of
fiction
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
half
written
,
when
,
in
an
interval
of
rest
,
I
thought
of
returning
home
.
   
<EOS>
For
a
long
time
,
though
studying
and
working
patiently
,
I
had
accustomed
myself
to
robust
exercise
.
 
<EOS>
My
health
,
severely
impaired
when
I
left
England
,
was
quite
restored
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
seen
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
been
in
many
countries
,
and
I
hope
I
had
improved
my
store
of
knowledge
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
now
recalled
all
that
I
think
it
needful
to
recall
here
,
of
this
term
of
absence
---
with
one
reservation
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
made
it
,
thus
far
,
with
no
purpose
of
suppressing
any
of
my
thoughts
;
for
,
as
I
have
elsewhere
said
,
this
narrative
is
my
written
memory
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
desired
to
keep
the
most
secret
current
of
my
mind
apart
,
and
to
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
I
enter
on
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
so
completely
penetrate
the
mystery
of
my
own
heart
,
as
to
know
when
I
began
to
think
that
I
might
have
set
its
earliest
and
brightest
hopes
on
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
at
what
stage
of
my
grief
it
first
became
associated
with
the
reflection
,
that
,
in
my
wayward
boyhood
,
I
had
thrown
away
the
treasure
of
her
love
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
may
have
heard
some
whisper
of
that
distant
thought
,
in
the
old
unhappy
loss
or
want
of
something
never
to
be
realized
,
of
which
I
had
been
sensible
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
thought
came
into
my
mind
as
a
new
reproach
and
new
regret
,
when
I
was
left
so
sad
and
lonely
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
If
,
at
that
time
,
I
had
been
much
with
her
,
I
should
,
in
the
weakness
of
my
desolation
,
have
betrayed
this
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
what
I
remotely
dreaded
when
I
was
first
impelled
to
stay
away
from
England
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
borne
to
lose
the
smallest
portion
of
her
sisterly
affection
;
yet
,
in
that
betrayal
,
I
should
have
set
a
constraint
between
us
hitherto
unknown
.
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
forget
that
the
feeling
with
which
she
now
regarded
me
had
grown
up
in
my
own
free
choice
and
course
.
 
<EOS>
That
if
she
had
ever
loved
me
with
another
love
---
and
I
sometimes
thought
the
time
was
when
she
might
have
done
so
---
I
had
cast
it
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
nothing
,
now
,
that
I
had
accustomed
myself
to
think
of
her
,
when
we
were
both
mere
children
,
as
one
who
was
far
removed
from
my
wild
fancies
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
bestowed
my
passionate
tenderness
upon
another
object
;
and
what
I
might
have
done
,
I
had
not
done
;
and
what
Agnes
was
to
me
,
I
and
her
own
noble
heart
had
made
her
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
beginning
of
the
change
that
gradually
worked
in
me
,
when
I
tried
to
get
a
better
understanding
of
myself
and
be
a
better
man
,
I
did
glance
,
through
some
indefinite
probation
,
to
a
period
when
I
might
possibly
hope
to
cancel
the
mistaken
past
,
and
to
be
so
blessed
as
to
marry
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
time
wore
on
,
this
shadowy
prospect
faded
,
and
departed
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
had
ever
loved
me
,
then
,
I
should
hold
her
the
more
sacred
;
remembering
the
confidences
I
had
reposed
in
her
,
her
knowledge
of
my
errant
heart
,
the
sacrifice
she
must
have
made
to
be
my
friend
and
sister
,
and
the
victory
she
had
won
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
had
never
loved
me
,
could
I
believe
that
she
would
love
me
now
?
   
<EOS>
I
had
always
felt
my
weakness
,
in
comparison
with
her
constancy
and
fortitude
;
and
now
I
felt
it
more
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
I
might
have
been
to
her
,
or
she
to
me
,
if
I
had
been
more
worthy
of
her
long
ago
,
I
was
not
now
,
and
she
was
not
.
 
<EOS>
The
time
was
past
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
let
it
go
by
,
and
had
deservedly
lost
her
.
   
<EOS>
That
I
suffered
much
in
these
contentions
,
that
they
filled
me
with
unhappiness
and
remorse
,
and
yet
that
I
had
a
sustaining
sense
that
it
was
required
of
me
,
in
right
and
honour
,
to
keep
away
from
myself
,
with
shame
,
the
thought
of
turning
to
the
dear
girl
in
the
withering
of
my
hopes
,
from
whom
I
had
frivolously
turned
when
they
were
bright
and
fresh
---
which
consideration
was
at
the
root
of
every
thought
I
had
concerning
her
---
is
all
equally
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
no
effort
to
conceal
from
myself
,
now
,
that
I
loved
her
,
that
I
was
devoted
to
her
;
but
I
brought
the
assurance
home
to
myself
,
that
it
was
now
too
late
,
and
that
our
long
-
subsisting
relation
must
be
undisturbed
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
thought
,
much
and
often
,
of
my
Dora
's
shadowing
out
to
me
what
might
have
happened
,
in
those
years
that
were
destined
not
to
try
us
;
I
had
considered
how
the
things
that
never
happen
,
are
often
as
much
realities
to
us
,
in
their
effects
,
as
those
that
are
accomplished
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
years
she
spoke
of
,
were
realities
now
,
for
my
correction
;
and
would
have
been
,
one
day
,
a
little
later
perhaps
,
though
we
had
parted
in
our
earliest
folly
.
 
<EOS>
I
endeavoured
to
convert
what
might
have
been
between
myself
and
Agnes
,
into
a
means
of
making
me
more
self
-
denying
,
more
resolved
,
more
conscious
of
myself
,
and
my
defects
and
errors
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
through
the
reflection
that
it
might
have
been
,
I
arrived
at
the
conviction
that
it
could
never
be
.
   
<EOS>
These
,
with
their
perplexities
and
inconsistencies
,
were
the
shifting
quicksands
of
my
mind
,
from
the
time
of
my
departure
to
the
time
of
my
return
home
,
three
years
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
Three
years
had
elapsed
since
the
sailing
of
the
emigrant
ship
;
when
,
at
that
same
hour
of
sunset
,
and
in
the
same
place
,
I
stood
on
the
deck
of
the
packet
vessel
that
brought
me
home
,
looking
on
the
rosy
water
where
I
had
seen
the
image
of
that
ship
reflected
.
   
<EOS>
Three
years
.
 
<EOS>
Long
in
the
aggregate
,
though
short
as
they
went
by
.
<EOS>
And
home
was
very
dear
to
me
,
and
Agnes
too
---
but
she
was
not
mine
---
she
was
never
to
be
mine
.
 
<EOS>
She
might
have
been
,
but
that
was
past
!

Chapter

<EOS>
Return
 
<EOS>
I
landed
in
London
on
a
wintry
autumn
evening
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
dark
and
raining
,
and
I
saw
more
fog
and
mud
in
a
minute
than
I
had
seen
in
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
from
the
Custom
House
to
the
Monument
before
I
found
a
coach
;
and
although
the
very
house
-
fronts
,
looking
on
the
swollen
gutters
,
were
like
old
friends
to
me
,
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
admit
that
they
were
very
dingy
friends
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
often
remarked
---
I
suppose
everybody
has
---
that
one
's
going
away
from
a
familiar
place
,
would
seem
to
be
the
signal
for
change
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
looked
out
of
the
coach
window
,
and
observed
that
an
old
house
on
Fish
-
street
Hill
,
which
had
stood
untouched
by
painter
,
carpenter
,
or
bricklayer
,
for
a
century
,
had
been
pulled
down
in
my
absence
;
and
that
a
neighbouring
street
,
of
time
-
honoured
insalubrity
and
inconvenience
,
was
being
drained
and
widened
;
I
half
expected
to
find
St
Paul
's
Cathedral
looking
older
.
   
<EOS>
For
some
changes
in
the
fortunes
of
my
friends
,
I
was
prepared
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
had
long
been
re
-
established
at
Dover
,
and
Traddles
had
begun
to
get
into
some
little
practice
at
the
Bar
,
in
the
very
first
term
after
my
departure
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
chambers
in
Gray
's
Inn
,
now
;
and
had
told
me
,
in
his
last
letters
,
that
he
was
not
without
hopes
of
being
soon
united
to
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
They
expected
me
home
before
Christmas
;
but
had
no
idea
of
my
returning
so
soon
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
purposely
misled
them
,
that
I
might
have
the
pleasure
of
taking
them
by
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
,
I
was
perverse
enough
to
feel
a
chill
and
disappointment
in
receiving
no
welcome
,
and
rattling
,
alone
and
silent
,
through
the
misty
streets
.
   
<EOS>
The
well
-
known
shops
,
however
,
with
their
cheerful
lights
,
did
something
for
me
;
and
when
I
alighted
at
the
door
of
the
Gray
's
Inn
Coffee
-
house
,
I
had
recovered
my
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
It
recalled
,
at
first
,
that
so
-
different
time
when
I
had
put
up
at
the
Golden
Cross
,
and
reminded
me
of
the
changes
that
had
come
to
pass
since
then
;
but
that
was
natural
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
where
Mr
Traddles
lives
in
the
Inn
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
the
waiter
,
as
I
warmed
myself
by
the
coffee
-
room
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
Holborn
Court
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Number
two
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Traddles
has
a
rising
reputation
among
the
lawyers
,
I
believe
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
waiter
,
"
<EOS>
probably
he
has
,
sir
;
but
I
am
not
aware
of
it
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
waiter
,
who
was
middle
-
aged
and
spare
,
looked
for
help
to
a
waiter
of
more
authority
---
a
stout
,
potential
old
man
,
with
a
double
chin
,
in
black
breeches
and
stockings
,
who
came
out
of
a
place
like
a
churchwarden
's
pew
,
at
the
end
of
the
coffee
-
room
,
where
he
kept
company
with
a
cash
-
box
,
a
Directory
,
a
Law
-
list
,
and
other
books
and
papers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Traddles
,
"
said
the
spare
waiter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Number
two
in
the
Court
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
potential
waiter
waved
him
away
,
and
turned
,
gravely
,
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
inquiring
,
"
said
I
,
"
whether
Mr
Traddles
,
at
number
two
in
the
Court
,
has
not
a
rising
reputation
among
the
lawyers
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
heard
his
name
,
"
said
the
waiter
,
in
a
rich
husky
voice
.
   
<EOS>
I
felt
quite
apologetic
for
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
young
man
,
sure
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
portentous
waiter
,
fixing
his
eyes
severely
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
long
has
he
been
in
the
Inn
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
above
three
years
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
The
waiter
,
who
I
supposed
had
lived
in
his
churchwarden
's
pew
for
forty
years
,
could
not
pursue
such
an
insignificant
subject
.
 
<EOS>
He
asked
me
what
I
would
have
for
dinner
?
   
<EOS>
I
felt
I
was
in
England
again
,
and
really
was
quite
cast
down
on
Traddles
's
account
.
 
<EOS>
There
seemed
to
be
no
hope
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
meekly
ordered
a
bit
of
fish
and
a
steak
,
and
stood
before
the
fire
musing
on
his
obscurity
.
   
<EOS>
As
I
followed
the
chief
waiter
with
my
eyes
,
I
could
not
help
thinking
that
the
garden
in
which
he
had
gradually
blown
to
be
the
flower
he
was
,
was
an
arduous
place
to
rise
in
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
such
a
prescriptive
,
stiff
-
necked
,
long
-
established
,
solemn
,
elderly
air
.
<EOS>
I
glanced
about
the
room
,
which
had
had
its
sanded
floor
sanded
,
no
doubt
,
in
exactly
the
same
manner
when
the
chief
waiter
was
a
boy
---
if
he
ever
was
a
boy
,
which
appeared
improbable
;
and
at
the
shining
tables
,
where
I
saw
myself
reflected
,
in
unruffled
depths
of
old
mahogany
;
and
at
the
lamps
,
without
a
flaw
in
their
trimming
or
cleaning
;
and
at
the
comfortable
green
curtains
,
with
their
pure
brass
rods
,
snugly
enclosing
the
boxes
;
and
at
the
two
large
coal
fires
,
brightly
burning
;
and
at
the
rows
of
decanters
,
burly
as
if
with
the
consciousness
of
pipes
of
expensive
old
port
wine
below
;
and
both
England
,
and
the
law
,
appeared
to
me
to
be
very
difficult
indeed
to
be
taken
by
storm
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
up
to
my
bedroom
to
change
my
wet
clothes
;
and
the
vast
extent
of
that
old
wainscoted
apartment
(
which
was
over
the
archway
leading
to
the
Inn
,
I
remember
)
,
and
the
sedate
immensity
of
the
four
-
post
bedstead
,
and
the
indomitable
gravity
of
the
chests
of
drawers
,
all
seemed
to
unite
in
sternly
frowning
on
the
fortunes
of
Traddles
,
or
on
any
such
daring
youth
.
<EOS>
I
came
down
again
to
my
dinner
;
and
even
the
slow
comfort
of
the
meal
,
and
the
orderly
silence
of
the
place
---
which
was
bare
of
guests
,
the
Long
Vacation
not
yet
being
over
---
were
eloquent
on
the
audacity
of
Traddles
,
and
his
small
hopes
of
a
livelihood
for
twenty
years
to
come
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
seen
nothing
like
this
since
I
went
away
,
and
it
quite
dashed
my
hopes
for
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
The
chief
waiter
had
had
enough
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
near
me
no
more
;
but
devoted
himself
to
an
old
gentleman
in
long
gaiters
,
to
meet
whom
a
pint
of
special
port
seemed
to
come
out
of
the
cellar
of
its
own
accord
,
for
he
gave
no
order
.
 
<EOS>
The
second
waiter
informed
me
,
in
a
whisper
,
that
this
old
gentleman
was
a
retired
conveyancer
living
in
the
Square
,
and
worth
a
mint
of
money
,
which
it
was
expected
he
would
leave
to
his
laundress
's
daughter
;
likewise
that
it
was
rumoured
that
he
had
a
service
of
plate
in
a
bureau
,
all
tarnished
with
lying
by
,
though
more
than
one
spoon
and
a
fork
had
never
yet
been
beheld
in
his
chambers
by
mortal
vision
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
I
quite
gave
Traddles
up
for
lost
;
and
settled
in
my
own
mind
that
there
was
no
hope
for
him
.
   
<EOS>
Being
very
anxious
to
see
the
dear
old
fellow
,
nevertheless
,
I
dispatched
my
dinner
,
in
a
manner
not
at
all
calculated
to
raise
me
in
the
opinion
of
the
chief
waiter
,
and
hurried
out
by
the
back
way
.
 
<EOS>
Number
two
in
the
Court
was
soon
reached
;
and
an
inscription
on
the
door
-
post
informing
me
that
Mr
Traddles
occupied
a
set
of
chambers
on
the
top
storey
<EOS>
,
I
ascended
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
A
crazy
old
staircase
<EOS>
I
found
it
to
be
,
feebly
lighted
on
each
landing
by
a
club
-
headed
little
oil
wick
,
dying
away
in
a
little
dungeon
of
dirty
glass
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
my
stumbling
upstairs
,
I
fancied
I
heard
a
pleasant
sound
of
laughter
;
and
not
the
laughter
of
an
attorney
or
barrister
,
or
attorney
's
clerk
or
barrister
's
clerk
,
but
of
two
or
three
merry
girls
.
 
<EOS>
Happening
,
however
,
as
I
stopped
to
listen
,
to
put
my
foot
in
a
hole
where
the
Honourable
Society
of
Gray
's
Inn
had
left
a
plank
deficient
,
I
fell
down
with
some
noise
,
and
when
I
recovered
my
footing
all
was
silent
.
   
<EOS>
Groping
my
way
more
carefully
,
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
,
my
heart
beat
high
when
I
found
the
outer
door
,
which
had
Mr
TRADDLES
painted
on
it
,
open
.
 
<EOS>
I
knocked
.
 
<EOS>
A
considerable
scuffling
within
ensued
,
but
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
knocked
again
.
   
<EOS>
A
small
sharp
-
looking
lad
,
half
-
footboy
and
half
-
clerk
,
who
was
very
much
out
of
breath
,
but
who
looked
at
me
as
if
he
defied
me
to
prove
it
legally
,
presented
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr
Traddles
within
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
but
he
's
engaged
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
see
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
survey
of
me
,
the
sharp
-
looking
lad
decided
to
let
me
in
;
and
opening
the
door
wider
for
that
purpose
,
admitted
me
,
first
,
into
a
little
closet
of
a
hall
,
and
next
into
a
little
sitting
-
room
;
where
I
came
into
the
presence
of
my
old
friend
(
also
out
of
breath
)
,
seated
at
a
table
,
and
bending
over
papers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
God
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Traddles
,
looking
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
Copperfield
!
"
and
rushed
into
my
arms
,
where
I
held
him
tight
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
All
well
,
my
dear
Traddles
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
All
well
,
my
dear
,
dear
Copperfield
,
and
nothing
but
good
news
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
cried
with
pleasure
,
both
of
us
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
,
"
said
Traddles
,
rumpling
his
hair
in
his
excitement
,
which
was
a
most
unnecessary
operation
,
"
my
dearest
Copperfield
,
my
long
-
lost
and
most
welcome
friend
,
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you
!
<EOS>
How
brown
you
are
!
<EOS>
How
glad
I
am
!
<EOS>
Upon
my
life
and
honour
,
I
never
was
so
rejoiced
,
my
beloved
Copperfield
,
never
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
was
equally
at
a
loss
to
express
my
emotions
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
quite
unable
to
speak
,
at
first
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
!
"
said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
grown
so
famous
!
<EOS>
My
glorious
Copperfield
!
<EOS>
Good
gracious
me
,
WHEN
did
you
come
,
WHERE
have
you
come
from
,
WHAT
have
you
been
doing
?
"
   
<EOS>
Never
pausing
for
an
answer
to
anything
he
said
,
Traddles
,
who
had
clapped
me
into
an
easy
-
chair
by
the
fire
,
all
this
time
impetuously
stirred
the
fire
with
one
hand
,
and
pulled
at
my
neck
-
kerchief
with
the
other
,
under
some
wild
delusion
that
it
was
a
great
-
coat
.
 
<EOS>
Without
putting
down
the
poker
,
he
now
hugged
me
again
;
and
I
hugged
him
;
and
,
both
laughing
,
and
both
wiping
our
eyes
,
we
both
sat
down
,
and
shook
hands
across
the
hearth
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
think
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
that
you
should
have
been
so
nearly
coming
home
as
you
must
have
been
,
my
dear
old
boy
,
and
not
at
the
ceremony
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
ceremony
,
my
dear
Traddles
?
"
   
"
Good
gracious
me
!
"
cried
Traddles
,
opening
his
eyes
in
his
old
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
you
get
my
last
letter
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
if
it
referred
to
any
ceremony
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
"
said
Traddles
,
sticking
his
hair
upright
with
both
hands
,
and
then
putting
his
hands
on
my
knees
,
"
I
am
married
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Married
!
<EOS>
"
I
cried
joyfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
me
,
yes
,
!
"
<EOS>
said
Traddles
---
"
by
the
Reverend
Horace
---
to
Sophy
---
down
in
Devonshire
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
my
dear
boy
,
she
's
behind
the
window
curtain
!
<EOS>
Look
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
To
my
amazement
,
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
came
at
that
same
instant
,
laughing
and
blushing
,
from
her
place
of
concealment
.
 
<EOS>
And
a
more
cheerful
,
amiable
,
honest
,
happy
,
bright
-
looking
bride
<EOS>
,
I
believe
(
as
I
could
not
help
saying
on
the
spot
)
<EOS>
the
world
never
saw
.
 
<EOS>
I
kissed
her
as
an
old
acquaintance
<EOS>
should
,
and
wished
them
joy
with
all
my
might
of
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
what
a
delightful
re
-
union
this
is
!
<EOS>
You
are
so
extremely
brown
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Copperfield
!
<EOS>
God
bless
my
soul
,
how
happy
I
am
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
am
I
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
am
sure
I
am
!
"
said
the
blushing
and
laughing
Sophy
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
all
as
happy
as
possible
!
"
said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Even
the
girls
are
happy
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
me
,
I
declare
I
forgot
them
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Forgot
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
The
girls
,
"
said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sophy
's
sisters
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
staying
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
come
to
have
a
peep
at
London
.
 
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
when
---
was
it
you
that
tumbled
upstairs
,
Copperfield
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
,
"
said
I
,
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
when
you
tumbled
upstairs
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
I
was
romping
with
the
girls
.
 
<EOS>
In
point
of
fact
,
we
were
playing
at
Puss
in
the
Corner
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
that
would
n't
do
in
Westminster
Hall
,
and
as
it
would
n't
look
quite
professional
if
they
were
seen
by
a
client
,
they
decamped
.
 
<EOS>
And
they
are
now
---
listening
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
"
said
Traddles
,
glancing
at
the
door
of
another
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
,
"
said
I
,
laughing
afresh
,
"
to
have
occasioned
such
a
dispersion
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
"
rejoined
Traddles
,
greatly
delighted
,
"
if
you
had
seen
them
running
away
,
and
running
back
again
,
after
you
had
knocked
,
to
pick
up
the
combs
they
had
dropped
out
of
their
hair
,
and
going
on
in
the
maddest
manner
,
you
would
n't
have
said
so
.
 
<EOS>
My
love
,
will
you
fetch
the
girls
?
"
   
<EOS>
Sophy
tripped
away
,
and
we
heard
her
received
in
the
adjoining
room
with
a
peal
of
laughter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Really
musical
,
is
n't
it
,
my
dear
Copperfield
?
"
said
Traddles
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
agreeable
to
hear
.
 
<EOS>
It
quite
lights
up
these
old
rooms
.
<EOS>
To
an
unfortunate
bachelor
of
a
fellow
who
has
lived
alone
all
his
life
,
you
know
,
it
's
positively
delicious
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
charming
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
things
,
they
have
had
a
great
loss
in
Sophy
---
who
,
I
do
assure
you
,
Copperfield
is
,
and
ever
was
,
the
dearest
girl
!
<EOS>
---
and
it
gratifies
me
beyond
expression
to
find
them
in
such
good
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
The
society
of
girls
is
a
very
delightful
thing
,
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
professional
,
but
it
's
very
delightful
.
"
   
<EOS>
Observing
that
he
slightly
faltered
,
and
comprehending
that
in
the
goodness
of
his
heart
he
was
fearful
of
giving
me
some
pain
by
what
he
had
said
,
I
expressed
my
concurrence
with
a
heartiness
that
evidently
relieved
and
pleased
him
greatly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
then
,
"
said
Traddles
,
"
our
domestic
arrangements
are
,
to
say
the
truth
,
quite
unprofessional
altogether
,
my
dear
Copperfield
.
<EOS>
Even
Sophy
's
being
here
,
is
unprofessional
.
 
<EOS>
And
we
have
no
other
place
of
abode
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
put
to
sea
in
a
cockboat
,
but
we
are
quite
prepared
to
rough
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
Sophy
's
an
extraordinary
manager
!
<EOS>
You
'll
be
surprised
how
those
girls
are
stowed
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
hardly
know
how
it
's
done
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
many
of
the
young
ladies
with
you
?
"
<EOS>
I
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
eldest
,
the
Beauty
is
here
,
"
said
Traddles
,
in
a
low
confidential
voice
,
"
Caroline
.
 
<EOS>
And
Sarah
's
here
---
the
one
I
mentioned
to
you
as
having
something
the
matter
with
her
spine
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Immensely
better
!
<EOS>
And
the
two
youngest
that
Sophy
educated
are
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
And
Louisa
's
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
"
cried
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
the
whole
set
---
I
mean
the
chambers
---
is
only
three
rooms
;
but
Sophy
arranges
for
the
girls
in
the
most
wonderful
way
,
and
they
sleep
as
comfortably
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Three
in
that
room
,
"
said
Traddles
,
pointing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Two
in
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
glancing
round
,
in
search
of
the
accommodation
remaining
for
Mr
and
Mrs
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
understood
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Traddles
,
"
we
are
prepared
to
rough
it
,
as
I
said
just
now
,
and
we
did
improvise
a
bed
last
week
,
upon
the
floor
here
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
a
little
room
in
the
roof
---
a
very
nice
room
,
when
you
're
up
there
---
which
Sophy
papered
herself
,
to
surprise
me
;
and
that
's
our
room
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
capital
little
gipsy
sort
of
place
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
quite
a
view
from
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
happily
married
at
last
,
my
dear
Traddles
!
"
said
I.
"
<EOS>
How
rejoiced
I
am
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
"
said
Traddles
,
as
we
shook
hands
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
as
happy
as
it
's
possible
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
your
old
friend
,
you
see
,
"
said
Traddles
,
nodding
triumphantly
at
the
flower
-
pot
and
stand
;
"
and
there
's
the
table
with
the
marble
top
!
<EOS>
All
the
other
furniture
is
plain
and
serviceable
,
you
perceive
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
to
plate
,
Lord
bless
you
<EOS>
,
we
have
n't
so
much
as
a
tea
-
spoon
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
to
be
earned
?
"
said
I
,
cheerfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Exactly
so
,
"
replied
Traddles
,
"
all
to
be
earned
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
we
have
something
in
the
shape
of
tea
-
spoons
,
because
we
stir
our
tea
.
<EOS>
But
they
're
Britannia
metal
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
silver
will
be
the
brighter
when
it
comes
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
The
very
thing
we
say
!
"
cried
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
"
falling
again
into
the
low
confidential
tone
,
"
after
I
had
delivered
my
argument
in
DOE
dem
.
 
<EOS>
JIPES
versus
WIGZIELL
,
which
did
me
great
service
with
the
profession
<EOS>
,
I
went
down
into
Devonshire
,
and
had
some
serious
conversation
in
private
with
the
Reverend
Horace
.
 
<EOS>
I
dwelt
upon
the
fact
that
Sophy
---
who
I
do
assure
you
,
Copperfield
,
is
the
dearest
girl
!
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
I
am
certain
she
is
!
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
She
is
,
indeed
!
"
rejoined
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
afraid
I
am
wandering
from
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
mention
the
Reverend
Horace
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
said
that
you
dwelt
upon
the
fact
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
True
!
<EOS>
Upon
the
fact
that
Sophy
and
I
had
been
engaged
for
a
long
period
,
and
that
Sophy
,
with
the
permission
of
her
parents
,
was
more
than
content
to
take
me
---
in
short
,
"
said
Traddles
,
with
his
old
frank
smile
,
"
on
our
present
Britannia
-
metal
footing
.
 
<EOS>
Very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
proposed
to
the
Reverend
Horace
---
who
is
a
most
excellent
clergyman
,
Copperfield
,
and
ought
to
be
a
Bishop
;
or
at
least
ought
to
have
enough
to
live
upon
,
without
pinching
himself
---
that
if
I
could
turn
the
corner
,
say
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
,
in
one
year
;
and
could
see
my
way
pretty
clearly
to
that
,
or
something
better
,
next
year
;
and
could
plainly
furnish
a
little
place
like
this
,
besides
;
then
,
and
in
that
case
,
Sophy
<EOS>
and
I
should
be
united
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
the
liberty
of
representing
that
we
had
been
patient
for
a
good
many
years
;
and
that
the
circumstance
of
Sophy
's
being
extraordinarily
useful
at
home
,
ought
not
to
operate
with
her
affectionate
parents
,
against
her
establishment
in
life
---
do
n't
you
see
?
"
   
"
Certainly
it
ought
not
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
think
so
,
<EOS>
Copperfield
,
"
rejoined
Traddles
,
"
because
,
without
any
imputation
on
the
Reverend
Horace
,
I
do
think
parents
,
and
brothers
,
and
so
forth
,
are
sometimes
rather
selfish
in
such
cases
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
also
pointed
out
,
that
my
most
earnest
desire
was
,
to
be
useful
to
the
family
;
and
that
if
I
got
on
in
the
world
,
and
anything
should
happen
to
him
---
I
refer
to
the
Reverend
Horace
---
"
   
"
I
understand
,
"
said
I.
   
"
---
<EOS>
Or
to
Mrs
Crewler
---
it
would
be
the
utmost
gratification
of
my
wishes
,
to
be
a
parent
to
the
girls
.
 
<EOS>
He
replied
in
a
most
admirable
manner
,
exceedingly
flattering
to
my
feelings
,
and
undertook
to
obtain
the
consent
of
Mrs
Crewler
to
this
arrangement
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
a
dreadful
time
of
it
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
mounted
from
her
legs
into
her
chest
,
and
then
into
her
head
---
"
   
"
What
mounted
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Her
grief
,
"
replied
Traddles
,
with
a
serious
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
Her
feelings
generally
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
mentioned
on
a
former
occasion
,
she
is
a
very
superior
woman
,
but
has
lost
the
use
of
her
limbs
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
occurs
to
harass
her
,
usually
settles
in
her
legs
;
but
on
this
occasion
it
mounted
to
the
chest
,
and
then
to
the
head
,
and
,
in
short
,
pervaded
the
whole
system
in
a
most
alarming
manner
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
they
brought
her
through
it
by
unremitting
and
affectionate
attention
;
and
we
were
married
yesterday
six
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
no
idea
what
a
Monster
<EOS>
I
felt
,
Copperfield
,
when
I
saw
the
whole
family
crying
and
fainting
away
in
every
direction
!
<EOS>
Mrs
Crewler
could
n't
see
me
before
we
left
---
could
n't
forgive
me
,
then
,
for
depriving
her
of
her
child
---
but
she
is
a
good
creature
,
and
has
done
so
since
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
delightful
letter
from
her
,
only
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
And
in
short
,
my
dear
friend
,
"
said
I
,
"
you
feel
as
blest
as
you
deserve
to
feel
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
That
's
your
partiality
!
"
<EOS>
laughed
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
indeed
,
I
am
in
a
most
enviable
state
.
 
<EOS>
I
work
hard
,
and
read
Law
insatiably
.
<EOS>
I
get
up
at
five
every
morning
,
and
do
n't
mind
it
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
hide
the
girls
in
the
daytime
,
and
make
merry
with
them
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
And
I
assure
you
I
am
quite
sorry
that
they
are
going
home
on
Tuesday
,
which
is
the
day
before
the
first
day
of
Michaelmas
Term
.
<EOS>
But
here
,
"
said
Traddles
,
breaking
off
in
his
confidence
,
and
speaking
aloud
,
"
ARE
the
girls
!
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
,
Miss
Crewler
---
Miss
Sarah
---
Miss
Louisa
---
Margaret
and
Lucy
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
were
a
perfect
nest
of
roses
;
they
looked
so
wholesome
and
fresh
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
all
pretty
,
and
Miss
Caroline
was
very
handsome
;
but
there
was
a
loving
,
cheerful
,
fireside
quality
in
Sophy
's
bright
looks
,
which
was
better
than
that
,
and
which
assured
me
that
my
friend
had
chosen
well
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
sat
round
the
fire
;
while
the
sharp
boy
,
who
I
now
divined
had
lost
his
breath
in
putting
the
papers
out
,
cleared
them
away
again
,
and
produced
the
tea
-
things
.
<EOS>
After
that
,
he
retired
for
the
night
,
shutting
the
outer
door
upon
us
with
a
bang
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Traddles
,
with
perfect
pleasure
and
composure
beaming
from
her
household
eyes
,
having
made
the
tea
,
then
quietly
made
the
toast
as
she
sat
in
a
corner
by
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
She
had
seen
Agnes
,
she
told
me
while
she
was
toasting
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tom
"
had
taken
her
down
into
Kent
for
a
wedding
trip
,
and
there
she
had
seen
my
aunt
,
too
;
and
both
my
aunt
and
Agnes
were
well
,
and
they
had
all
talked
of
nothing
but
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tom
"
had
never
had
me
out
of
his
thoughts
<EOS>
,
she
really
believed
,
all
the
time
I
had
been
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tom
"
was
the
authority
for
everything
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tom
"
was
evidently
the
idol
of
her
life
;
never
to
be
shaken
on
his
pedestal
by
any
commotion
;
always
to
be
believed
in
,
and
done
homage
to
with
the
whole
faith
of
her
heart
,
come
what
might
.
   
<EOS>
The
deference
which
both
she
and
Traddles
showed
towards
the
Beauty
,
pleased
me
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
I
thought
it
very
reasonable
;
but
I
thought
it
very
delightful
,
and
essentially
a
part
of
their
character
.
 
<EOS>
If
Traddles
ever
for
an
instant
missed
the
tea
-
spoons
that
were
still
to
be
won
,
I
have
no
doubt
it
was
when
he
handed
the
Beauty
her
tea
.
 
<EOS>
If
his
sweet
-
tempered
wife
could
have
got
up
any
self
-
assertion
against
anyone
,
I
am
satisfied
it
could
only
have
been
because
she
was
the
Beauty
's
sister
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
slight
indications
of
a
rather
petted
and
capricious
manner
,
which
I
observed
in
the
Beauty
,
were
manifestly
considered
,
by
Traddles
and
his
wife
,
as
her
birthright
and
natural
endowment
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
had
been
born
a
Queen
Bee
,
and
they
labouring
Bees
,
they
could
not
have
been
more
satisfied
of
that
.
   
<EOS>
But
their
self
-
forgetfulness
charmed
me
.
 
<EOS>
Their
pride
in
these
girls
,
and
their
submission
of
themselves
to
all
their
whims
,
was
the
pleasantest
little
testimony
to
their
own
worth
I
could
have
desired
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
If
Traddles
were
addressed
as
"
a
darling
"
,
once
in
the
course
of
that
evening
;
and
besought
to
bring
something
here
,
or
carry
something
there
,
or
take
something
up
,
or
put
something
down
,
or
find
something
,
or
fetch
something
,
he
was
so
addressed
,
by
one
or
other
of
his
sisters
-
in
-
law
,
at
least
twelve
times
in
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
could
they
do
anything
without
Sophy
.
 
<EOS>
Somebody
's
hair
fell
down
,
and
nobody
but
Sophy
could
put
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
Somebody
forgot
how
a
particular
tune
went
,
and
nobody
but
Sophy
could
hum
that
tune
right
.
 
<EOS>
Somebody
wanted
to
recall
the
name
of
a
place
in
Devonshire
,
and
only
Sophy
knew
it
.
 
<EOS>
Something
was
wanted
to
be
written
home
,
and
Sophy
alone
could
be
trusted
to
write
before
breakfast
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Somebody
broke
down
in
a
piece
of
knitting
,
and
no
one
but
Sophy
was
able
to
put
the
defaulter
in
the
right
direction
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
entire
mistresses
of
the
place
,
and
Sophy
and
Traddles
waited
on
them
.
 
<EOS>
How
many
children
Sophy
could
have
taken
care
of
in
her
time
,
I
ca
n't
imagine
;
but
she
seemed
to
be
famous
for
knowing
every
sort
of
song
that
ever
was
addressed
to
a
child
in
the
English
tongue
;
and
she
sang
dozens
to
order
with
the
clearest
little
voice
in
the
world
,
one
after
another
(
every
sister
issuing
directions
for
a
different
tune
,
and
the
Beauty
generally
striking
in
last
)
,
so
that
I
was
quite
fascinated
.
 
<EOS>
The
best
of
all
was
,
that
,
in
the
midst
of
their
exactions
,
all
the
sisters
had
a
great
tenderness
and
respect
both
for
Sophy
and
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
when
I
took
my
leave
,
and
Traddles
was
coming
out
to
walk
with
me
to
the
coffee
-
house
<EOS>
,
I
thought
I
had
never
seen
an
obstinate
head
of
hair
,
or
any
other
head
of
hair
,
rolling
about
in
such
a
shower
of
kisses
.
   
<EOS>
Altogether
,
it
was
a
scene
I
could
not
help
dwelling
on
with
pleasure
,
for
a
long
time
after
I
got
back
and
had
wished
Traddles
good
night
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
beheld
a
thousand
roses
blowing
in
a
top
set
of
chambers
,
in
that
withered
Gray
's
Inn
,
they
could
not
have
brightened
it
half
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
The
idea
of
those
Devonshire
girls
,
among
the
dry
law
-
stationers
and
the
attorneys
'
offices
;
and
of
the
tea
and
toast
,
and
children
's
songs
,
in
that
grim
atmosphere
of
pounce
and
parchment
,
red
-
tape
,
dusty
wafers
,
ink
-
jars
,
brief
and
draft
paper
,
law
reports
,
writs
,
declarations
,
and
bills
of
costs
;
seemed
almost
as
pleasantly
fanciful
as
if
I
had
dreamed
that
the
Sultan
's
famous
family
had
been
admitted
on
the
roll
of
attorneys
,
and
had
brought
the
talking
bird
,
the
singing
tree
,
and
the
golden
water
into
Gray
's
Inn
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
Somehow
,
I
found
that
I
had
taken
leave
of
Traddles
for
the
night
,
and
come
back
to
the
coffee
-
house
,
with
a
great
change
in
my
despondency
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
began
to
think
he
would
get
on
,
in
spite
of
all
the
many
orders
of
chief
waiters
in
England
.
   
<EOS>
Drawing
a
chair
before
one
of
the
coffee
-
room
fires
to
think
about
him
at
my
leisure
,
I
gradually
fell
from
the
consideration
of
his
happiness
to
tracing
prospects
in
the
live
-
coals
,
and
to
thinking
,
as
they
broke
and
changed
,
of
the
principal
vicissitudes
and
separations
that
had
marked
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
not
seen
a
coal
fire
,
since
I
had
left
England
three
years
ago
:
though
many
a
wood
fire
had
I
watched
,
as
it
crumbled
into
hoary
ashes
,
and
mingled
with
the
feathery
heap
upon
the
hearth
,
which
not
inaptly
figured
to
me
,
in
my
despondency
,
my
own
dead
hopes
.
   
<EOS>
I
could
think
of
the
past
now
,
gravely
,
but
not
bitterly
;
and
could
contemplate
the
future
in
a
brave
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
Home
,
in
its
best
sense
,
was
for
me
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
She
in
whom
I
might
have
inspired
a
dearer
love
<EOS>
,
I
had
taught
to
be
my
sister
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
marry
,
and
would
have
new
claimants
on
her
tenderness
;
and
in
doing
it
,
would
never
know
the
love
for
her
that
had
grown
up
in
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
right
that
I
should
pay
the
forfeit
of
my
headlong
passion
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
reaped
,
I
had
sown
.
   
<EOS>
I
was
thinking
.
 
<EOS>
And
had
I
truly
disciplined
my
heart
to
this
,
and
could
I
resolutely
bear
it
,
and
calmly
hold
the
place
in
her
home
which
she
had
calmly
held
in
mine
,
---
when
I
found
my
eyes
resting
on
a
countenance
that
might
have
arisen
out
of
the
fire
,
in
its
association
with
my
early
remembrances
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Mr
Chillip
the
Doctor
,
to
whose
good
offices
<EOS>
I
was
indebted
in
the
very
first
chapter
of
this
history
,
sat
reading
a
newspaper
in
the
shadow
of
an
opposite
corner
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
tolerably
stricken
in
years
by
this
time
;
but
,
being
a
mild
,
meek
,
calm
little
man
,
had
worn
so
easily
,
<EOS>
that
I
thought
he
looked
at
that
moment
just
as
he
might
have
looked
when
he
sat
in
our
parlour
,
waiting
for
me
to
be
born
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chillip
had
left
Blunderstone
six
or
seven
years
ago
,
and
I
had
never
seen
him
since
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
placidly
perusing
the
newspaper
,
with
his
little
head
on
one
side
,
and
a
glass
of
warm
sherry
negus
at
his
elbow
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
extremely
conciliatory
in
his
manner
that
he
seemed
to
apologize
to
the
very
newspaper
for
taking
the
liberty
of
reading
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
walked
up
to
where
he
was
sitting
,
and
said
,
"
How
do
you
do
,
Mr
Chillip
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
greatly
fluttered
by
this
unexpected
address
from
a
stranger
,
and
replied
,
in
his
slow
way
,
"
I
thank
you
,
sir
,
you
are
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
YOU
are
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
remember
me
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Chillip
,
smiling
very
meekly
,
and
shaking
his
head
as
he
surveyed
me
,
"
I
have
a
kind
of
an
impression
that
something
in
your
countenance
is
familiar
to
me
,
sir
;
but
I
could
n't
lay
my
hand
upon
your
name
,
really
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
you
knew
it
,
long
before
I
knew
it
myself
,
"
I
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did
I
indeed
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Chillip
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
that
I
had
the
honour
,
sir
,
of
officiating
when
---
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
cried
Mr
Chillip
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
no
doubt
you
are
a
good
deal
changed
since
then
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Probably
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
observed
Mr
Chillip
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
you
'll
excuse
me
,
if
I
am
compelled
to
ask
the
favour
of
your
name
?
"
   
<EOS>
On
my
telling
him
my
name
,
he
was
really
moved
.
 
<EOS>
He
quite
shook
hands
with
me
---
which
was
a
violent
proceeding
for
him
,
his
usual
course
being
to
slide
a
tepid
little
fish
-
slice
,
an
inch
or
two
in
advance
of
his
hip
,
and
evince
the
greatest
discomposure
when
anybody
grappled
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Even
now
,
he
put
his
hand
in
his
coat
-
pocket
as
soon
as
he
could
disengage
it
,
and
seemed
relieved
when
he
had
got
it
safe
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
sir
!
"
said
Mr
Chillip
,
surveying
me
with
his
head
on
one
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
it
's
Mr
Copperfield
,
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
I
think
I
should
have
known
you
,
if
I
had
taken
the
liberty
of
looking
more
closely
at
you
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
strong
resemblance
between
you
and
your
poor
father
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
my
father
,
"
I
observed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Chillip
,
in
a
soothing
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
very
much
to
be
deplored
it
was
,
on
all
accounts
!
<EOS>
We
are
not
ignorant
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Chillip
,
slowly
shaking
his
little
head
again
,
"
down
in
our
part
of
the
country
,
of
your
fame
.
 
<EOS>
There
must
be
great
excitement
here
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Chillip
,
tapping
himself
on
the
forehead
with
his
forefinger
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
find
it
a
trying
occupation
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
part
of
the
country
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
seating
myself
near
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
established
within
a
few
miles
of
Bury
St
Edmund
's
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Chillip
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Chillip
,
coming
into
a
little
property
in
that
neighbourhood
,
under
her
father
's
will
,
I
bought
a
practice
down
there
,
in
which
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
I
am
doing
well
.
 
<EOS>
My
daughter
is
growing
quite
a
tall
lass
now
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Chillip
,
giving
his
little
head
another
little
shake
.
 
<EOS>
"
Her
mother
let
down
two
tucks
in
her
frocks
only
last
week
.
 
<EOS>
Such
is
time
,
you
see
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
little
man
put
his
now
empty
glass
to
his
lips
,
when
he
made
this
reflection
,
I
proposed
to
him
to
have
it
refilled
,
and
I
would
keep
him
company
with
another
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
he
returned
,
in
his
slow
way
,
"
it
's
more
than
I
am
accustomed
to
;
but
I
ca
n't
deny
myself
the
pleasure
of
your
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
but
yesterday
that
I
had
the
honour
of
attending
you
in
the
measles
.
 
<EOS>
You
came
through
them
charmingly
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
acknowledged
this
compliment
,
and
ordered
the
negus
,
which
was
soon
produced
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
an
uncommon
dissipation
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Chillip
,
stirring
it
,
"
but
I
ca
n't
resist
so
extraordinary
an
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
no
family
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
shook
my
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
aware
that
you
sustained
a
bereavement
,
sir
,
some
time
ago
,
"
said
Mr
Chillip
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
heard
it
from
your
father
-
in
-
law
's
sister
.
<EOS>
Very
decided
character
there
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
"
said
I
,
"
decided
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Where
did
you
see
her
,
Mr
Chillip
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
not
aware
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Chillip
,
with
his
placidest
smile
,
"
that
your
father
-
in
-
law
is
again
a
neighbour
of
mine
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
indeed
,
sir
!
"
said
Mr
Chillip
.
 
<EOS>
"
Married
a
young
lady
of
that
part
,
with
a
very
good
little
property
,
poor
thing
.
 
<EOS>
---
And
this
action
of
the
brain
now
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
find
it
fatigue
you
?
"
said
Mr
Chillip
,
looking
at
me
like
an
admiring
Robin
.
   
<EOS>
I
waived
that
question
,
and
returned
to
the
Murdstones
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
aware
of
his
being
married
again
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
attend
the
family
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
regularly
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
called
in
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Strong
phrenological
developments
of
the
organ
of
firmness
,
in
Mr
Murdstone
and
his
sister
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
replied
with
such
an
expressive
look
,
that
Mr
Chillip
was
emboldened
by
that
,
and
the
negus
together
,
to
give
his
head
several
short
shakes
,
and
thoughtfully
exclaim
,
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
dear
me
!
<EOS>
We
remember
old
times
,
Mr
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
the
brother
and
sister
are
pursuing
their
old
course
,
are
they
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Chillip
,
"
a
medical
man
,
being
so
much
in
families
,
ought
to
have
neither
eyes
nor
ears
for
anything
but
his
profession
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
I
must
say
,
they
are
very
severe
,
sir
:
both
as
to
this
life
and
the
next
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
next
will
be
regulated
without
much
reference
to
them
,
I
dare
say
,
"
I
returned
:
"
what
are
they
doing
as
to
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chillip
shook
his
head
,
stirred
his
negus
,
and
sipped
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
was
a
charming
woman
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
he
observed
in
a
plaintive
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
present
Mrs
Murdstone
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
charming
woman
indeed
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Chillip
;
"
as
amiable
,
I
am
sure
,
as
it
was
possible
to
be
!
<EOS>
Mrs
Chillip
's
opinion
is
,
that
her
spirit
has
been
entirely
broken
since
her
marriage
,
and
that
she
is
all
but
melancholy
mad
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
ladies
,
"
observed
Mr
Chillip
,
timorously
,
"
are
great
observers
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
she
was
to
be
subdued
and
broken
to
their
detestable
mould
,
Heaven
help
her
!
"
said
I.
 
"
<EOS>
And
she
has
been
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
there
were
violent
quarrels
at
first
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
"
said
Mr
Chillip
;
"
but
she
is
quite
a
shadow
now
.
 
<EOS>
Would
it
be
considered
forward
if
I
was
to
say
to
you
,
sir
,
in
confidence
,
that
since
the
sister
came
to
help
,
the
brother
and
sister
between
them
have
nearly
reduced
her
to
a
state
of
imbecility
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
could
easily
believe
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
,
"
said
Mr
Chillip
,
fortifying
himself
with
another
sip
of
negus
,
"
between
you
and
me
,
sir
,
that
her
mother
died
of
it
---
or
that
tyranny
,
gloom
,
and
worry
have
made
Mrs
Murdstone
nearly
imbecile
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
lively
young
woman
,
sir
,
before
marriage
,
and
<EOS>
their
gloom
and
austerity
destroyed
her
.
 
<EOS>
They
go
about
with
her
,
now
,
more
like
her
keepers
than
her
husband
and
sister
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
Mrs
Chillip
's
remark
to
me
,
only
last
week
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
assure
you
,
sir
,
the
ladies
are
great
observers
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Chillip
herself
is
a
great
observer
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Does
he
gloomily
profess
to
be
<EOS>
(
I
am
ashamed
to
use
the
word
in
such
association
)
religious
still
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
anticipate
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Chillip
,
his
eyelids
getting
quite
red
with
the
unwonted
stimulus
in
which
he
was
indulging
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
of
Mrs
Chillip
's
most
impressive
remarks
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Chillip
,
"
he
proceeded
,
in
the
calmest
and
slowest
manner
,
"
quite
electrified
me
,
by
pointing
out
that
Mr
Murdstone
sets
up
an
image
of
himself
,
and
calls
it
the
Divine
Nature
.
 
<EOS>
You
might
have
knocked
me
down
on
the
flat
of
my
back
,
sir
,
with
the
feather
of
a
pen
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
when
Mrs
Chillip
said
so
.
 
<EOS>
The
ladies
are
great
observers
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Intuitively
,
"
said
I
,
to
his
extreme
delight
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
happy
to
receive
such
support
in
my
opinion
,
sir
,
"
he
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
often
that
I
venture
to
give
a
non
-
medical
opinion
,
I
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Murdstone
delivers
public
addresses
sometimes
,
and
it
is
said
,
---
in
short
,
sir
,
it
is
said
by
Mrs
Chillip
,
---
that
the
darker
tyrant
he
has
lately
been
,
the
more
ferocious
is
his
doctrine
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
Mrs
Chillip
to
be
perfectly
right
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Chillip
does
go
so
far
as
to
say
,
"
pursued
the
meekest
of
little
men
,
much
encouraged
,
"
that
what
such
people
miscall
their
religion
,
is
a
vent
for
their
bad
humours
and
arrogance
.
 
<EOS>
And
do
you
know
<EOS>
I
must
say
,
sir
,
"
he
continued
,
mildly
laying
his
head
on
one
side
,
"
that
I
DON'T
find
authority
for
Mr
and
Miss
Murdstone
in
the
New
Testament
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
found
it
either
!
"
said
I.
   
"
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Chillip
,
"
they
are
much
disliked
;
and
as
they
are
very
free
in
consigning
everybody
who
dislikes
them
to
perdition
,
we
really
have
a
good
deal
of
perdition
going
on
in
our
neighbourhood
!
<EOS>
However
,
as
Mrs
Chillip
says
,
sir
,
they
undergo
a
continual
punishment
;
for
they
are
turned
inward
,
to
feed
upon
their
own
hearts
,
and
their
own
hearts
are
very
bad
feeding
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
sir
,
about
that
brain
of
yours
,
if
you
'll
excuse
my
returning
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
expose
it
to
a
good
deal
of
excitement
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
found
it
not
difficult
,
in
the
excitement
of
Mr
Chillip
's
own
brain
,
under
his
potations
of
negus
,
to
divert
his
attention
from
this
topic
to
his
own
affairs
,
on
which
,
for
the
next
half
-
hour
,
he
was
quite
loquacious
;
giving
me
to
understand
,
among
other
pieces
of
information
,
that
he
was
then
at
the
Gray
's
Inn
Coffee
-
house
to
lay
his
professional
evidence
before
a
Commission
of
Lunacy
,
touching
the
state
of
mind
of
a
patient
who
had
become
deranged
from
excessive
drinking
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
assure
you
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
am
extremely
nervous
on
such
occasions
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
support
being
what
is
called
Bullied
,
sir
.
<EOS>
It
would
quite
unman
me
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
it
was
some
time
before
I
recovered
the
conduct
of
that
alarming
lady
,
on
the
night
of
your
birth
,
Mr
Copperfield
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
told
him
that
I
was
going
down
to
my
aunt
,
the
Dragon
of
that
night
,
early
in
the
morning
;
and
that
she
was
one
of
the
most
tender
-
hearted
and
excellent
of
women
,
as
he
would
know
full
well
if
he
knew
her
better
.
 
<EOS>
The
mere
notion
of
the
possibility
of
his
ever
seeing
her
again
,
appeared
to
terrify
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
replied
with
a
small
pale
smile
,
"
Is
she
so
,
indeed
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Really
?
<EOS>
"
and
almost
immediately
called
for
a
candle
,
and
went
to
bed
,
as
if
he
were
not
quite
safe
anywhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
actually
stagger
under
the
negus
;
but
I
should
think
his
placid
little
pulse
must
have
made
two
or
three
more
beats
in
a
minute
,
than
it
had
done
since
the
great
night
of
my
aunt
's
disappointment
,
when
she
struck
at
him
with
her
bonnet
.
   
<EOS>
Thoroughly
tired
,
I
went
to
bed
too
,
at
midnight
;
passed
the
next
day
on
the
Dover
coach
;
burst
safe
and
sound
into
my
aunt
's
old
parlour
while
she
was
at
tea
<EOS>
(
she
wore
spectacles
now
)
;
and
was
received
by
her
,
and
Mr
Dick
,
and
dear
old
Peggotty
,
who
acted
as
housekeeper
,
with
open
arms
and
tears
of
joy
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
was
mightily
amused
,
when
we
began
to
talk
composedly
,
by
my
account
of
my
meeting
with
Mr
Chillip
,
and
of
his
holding
her
in
such
dread
remembrance
;
and
both
she
and
Peggotty
had
a
great
deal
to
say
about
my
poor
mother
's
second
husband
,
and
"
that
murdering
woman
of
a
sister
"
,
---
on
whom
I
think
no
pain
or
penalty
would
have
induced
my
aunt
to
bestow
any
Christian
or
Proper
Name
,
or
any
other
designation
.

Chapter
60
.
<EOS>
Agnes
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
and
I
,
when
we
were
left
alone
,
talked
far
into
the
night
.
<EOS>
How
the
emigrants
never
wrote
home
,
otherwise
than
cheerfully
and
hopefully
;
how
Mr
Micawber
had
actually
remitted
divers
small
sums
of
money
,
on
account
of
those
"
pecuniary
liabilities
"
,
in
reference
to
which
he
had
been
so
business
-
like
as
between
man
and
man
<EOS>
;
how
Janet
,
returning
into
my
aunt
's
service
when
she
came
back
to
Dover
,
had
finally
carried
out
her
renunciation
of
mankind
by
entering
into
wedlock
with
a
thriving
tavern
-
keeper
;
and
how
my
aunt
had
finally
set
her
seal
on
the
same
great
principle
,
by
aiding
and
abetting
the
bride
,
and
crowning
the
marriage
-
ceremony
with
her
presence
;
were
among
our
topics
---
already
more
or
less
familiar
to
me
through
the
letters
I
had
had
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dick
,
as
usual
,
was
not
forgotten
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
informed
me
how
he
incessantly
occupied
himself
in
copying
everything
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
,
and
kept
King
Charles
the
First
at
a
respectful
distance
by
that
semblance
of
employment
;
how
it
was
one
of
the
main
joys
and
rewards
of
her
life
that
he
was
free
and
happy
,
instead
of
pining
in
monotonous
restraint
;
and
how
(
as
a
novel
general
conclusion
)
<EOS>
nobody
<EOS>
but
she
could
ever
fully
know
what
he
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
,
Trot
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
patting
the
back
of
my
hand
,
as
we
sat
in
our
old
way
before
the
fire
,
"
when
are
you
going
over
to
Canterbury
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
get
a
horse
,
and
ride
over
tomorrow
morning
,
aunt
,
unless
you
will
go
with
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
my
aunt
,
in
her
short
abrupt
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
stay
where
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
Then
,
I
should
ride
,
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
come
through
Canterbury
today
without
stopping
,
if
I
had
been
coming
to
anyone
but
her
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
pleased
,
but
answered
,
"
Tut
,
Trot
;
MY
old
bones
would
have
kept
till
tomorrow
!
"
and
softly
patted
my
hand
again
,
as
I
sat
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
Thoughtfully
,
for
I
could
not
be
here
once
more
,
and
so
near
Agnes
,
without
the
revival
of
those
regrets
with
which
I
had
so
long
been
occupied
.
 
<EOS>
Softened
regrets
they
might
be
,
teaching
me
what
I
had
failed
to
learn
when
my
younger
life
was
all
before
me
,
but
not
the
less
regrets
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Trot
,
"
I
seemed
to
hear
my
aunt
say
once
more
;
and
I
understood
her
better
now
---
"
Blind
,
blind
,
blind
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
both
kept
silence
for
some
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
raised
my
eyes
,
I
found
that
she
was
steadily
observant
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
had
followed
the
current
of
my
mind
;
for
it
seemed
to
me
an
easy
one
to
track
now
,
wilful
as
it
had
been
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
her
father
a
white
-
haired
old
man
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
"
though
a
better
man
in
all
other
respects
---
a
reclaimed
man
.
<EOS>
Neither
will
you
find
him
measuring
all
human
interests
,
and
joys
,
and
sorrows
,
with
his
one
poor
little
inch
-
rule
now
.
 
<EOS>
Trust
me
,
child
,
such
things
must
shrink
very
much
,
before
they
can
be
measured
off
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
they
must
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
her
,
"
pursued
my
aunt
,
"
as
good
,
as
beautiful
,
as
earnest
,
as
disinterested
,
as
she
has
always
been
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
knew
higher
praise
,
Trot
,
I
would
bestow
it
on
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
higher
praise
for
her
;
no
higher
reproach
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
had
I
strayed
so
far
away
!
   
<EOS>
"
If
she
trains
the
young
girls
whom
she
has
about
her
,
to
be
like
herself
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
earnest
even
to
the
filling
of
her
eyes
with
tears
,
"
<EOS>
Heaven
knows
,
her
life
will
be
well
employed
!
<EOS>
Useful
and
happy
,
as
she
said
that
day
!
<EOS>
How
could
she
be
otherwise
than
useful
and
happy
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Has
Agnes
any
---
<EOS>
"
I
was
thinking
aloud
,
rather
than
speaking
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
 
<EOS>
Hey
?
 
<EOS>
Any
what
?
<EOS>
"
said
my
aunt
,
sharply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Any
lover
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
A
score
,
"
cried
my
aunt
,
with
a
kind
of
indignant
pride
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
might
have
married
twenty
times
,
my
dear
,
since
you
have
been
gone
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
But
has
she
any
lover
who
is
worthy
of
her
?
 
<EOS>
Agnes
could
care
for
no
other
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
sat
musing
for
a
little
while
,
with
her
chin
upon
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Slowly
raising
her
eyes
to
mine
,
she
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
she
has
an
attachment
,
Trot
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
prosperous
one
?
"
said
I.
   
"
Trot
,
"
returned
my
aunt
gravely
,
"
I
ca
n't
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
tell
you
even
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
never
confided
it
to
me
,
but
I
suspect
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
looked
so
attentively
and
anxiously
at
me
<EOS>
(
I
even
saw
her
tremble
)
,
that
I
felt
now
,
more
than
ever
,
that
she
had
followed
my
late
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
I
summoned
all
the
resolutions
I
had
made
,
in
all
those
many
days
and
nights
,
and
all
those
many
conflicts
of
my
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
should
be
so
,
"
I
began
,
"
and
I
hope
it
is
---
"
   
"
I
do
n't
know
that
it
is
,
"
said
my
aunt
curtly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
be
ruled
by
my
suspicions
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
keep
them
secret
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
very
slight
,
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
should
be
so
,
"
I
repeated
,
"
Agnes
will
tell
me
at
her
own
good
time
.
 
<EOS>
A
sister
to
whom
I
have
confided
so
much
,
aunt
,
will
not
be
reluctant
to
confide
in
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
withdrew
her
eyes
from
mine
,
as
slowly
as
she
had
turned
them
upon
me
;
and
covered
them
thoughtfully
with
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
By
and
by
<EOS>
she
put
her
other
hand
on
my
shoulder
;
and
so
we
both
sat
,
looking
into
the
past
,
without
saying
another
word
,
until
we
parted
for
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
I
rode
away
,
early
in
the
morning
,
for
the
scene
of
my
old
school
-
days
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
I
was
yet
quite
happy
,
in
the
hope
that
I
was
gaining
a
victory
over
myself
;
even
in
the
prospect
of
so
soon
looking
on
her
face
again
.
   
<EOS>
The
well
-
remembered
ground
was
soon
traversed
,
and
I
came
into
the
quiet
streets
,
where
every
stone
was
a
boy
's
book
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
on
foot
to
the
old
house
,
and
went
away
with
a
heart
too
full
to
enter
.
 
<EOS>
I
returned
;
and
looking
,
as
I
passed
,
through
the
low
window
of
the
turret
-
room
where
first
Uriah
Heep
,
and
afterwards
Mr
Micawber
,
had
been
wo
nt
to
sit
,
saw
that
it
was
a
little
parlour
now
,
and
that
there
was
no
office
.
 
<EOS>
Otherwise
the
staid
old
house
was
,
as
to
its
cleanliness
and
order
,
still
just
as
it
had
been
when
I
first
saw
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
requested
the
new
maid
who
admitted
me
,
to
tell
Miss
Wickfield
that
a
gentleman
who
waited
on
her
from
a
friend
abroad
,
was
there
;
and
I
was
shown
up
the
grave
old
staircase
<EOS>
(
cautioned
of
the
steps
I
knew
so
well
)
,
into
the
unchanged
drawing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
books
that
Agnes
and
I
had
read
together
,
were
on
their
shelves
;
and
the
desk
where
I
had
laboured
at
my
lessons
,
many
a
night
,
stood
yet
at
the
same
old
corner
of
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
little
changes
that
had
crept
in
when
the
Heeps
were
there
,
were
changed
again
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
was
as
it
used
to
be
,
in
the
happy
time
.
   
<EOS>
I
stood
in
a
window
,
and
looked
across
the
ancient
street
at
the
opposite
houses
,
recalling
how
I
had
watched
them
on
wet
afternoons
,
when
I
first
came
there
;
and
how
I
had
used
to
speculate
about
the
people
who
appeared
at
any
of
the
windows
,
and
had
followed
them
with
my
eyes
up
and
down
stairs
,
while
women
went
clicking
along
the
pavement
in
pattens
,
and
the
dull
rain
fell
in
slanting
lines
,
and
poured
out
of
the
water
-
spout
yonder
,
and
flowed
into
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
The
feeling
with
which
I
used
to
watch
the
tramps
,
as
they
came
into
the
town
on
those
wet
evenings
,
at
dusk
,
and
limped
past
,
with
their
bundles
drooping
over
their
shoulders
at
the
ends
of
sticks
,
came
freshly
back
to
me
;
fraught
,
as
then
,
with
the
smell
of
damp
earth
,
and
wet
leaves
and
briar
,
and
the
sensation
of
the
very
airs
that
blew
upon
me
in
my
own
toilsome
journey
.
   
<EOS>
The
opening
of
the
little
door
in
the
panelled
wall
made
me
start
and
turn
.
 
<EOS>
Her
beautiful
serene
eyes
met
mine
as
she
came
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
stopped
and
laid
her
hand
upon
her
bosom
,
and
I
caught
her
in
my
arms
.
   
<EOS>
"
Agnes
!
<EOS>
my
dear
girl
!
<EOS>
I
have
come
too
suddenly
upon
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
<EOS>
I
am
so
rejoiced
to
see
you
,
Trotwood
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Agnes
,
the
happiness
<EOS>
it
is
to
me
,
to
see
you
once
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
folded
her
to
my
heart
,
and
,
for
a
little
while
,
we
were
both
silent
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
we
sat
down
,
side
by
side
;
and
her
angel
-
face
was
turned
upon
me
with
the
welcome
I
had
dreamed
of
,
waking
and
sleeping
,
for
whole
years
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
so
true
,
she
was
so
beautiful
<EOS>
,
she
was
so
good
,
---
I
owed
her
so
much
gratitude
,
she
was
so
dear
to
me
,
that
I
could
find
no
utterance
for
what
I
felt
.
 
<EOS>
I
tried
to
bless
her
,
tried
to
thank
her
,
tried
to
tell
her
(
as
I
had
often
done
in
letters
)
<EOS>
what
an
influence
she
had
upon
me
;
but
all
my
efforts
were
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
My
love
and
joy
were
dumb
.
   
<EOS>
With
her
own
sweet
tranquillity
,
she
calmed
my
agitation
;
led
me
back
to
the
time
of
our
parting
;
spoke
to
me
of
Emily
,
whom
she
had
visited
,
in
secret
,
many
times
;
spoke
to
me
tenderly
of
Dora
's
grave
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
unerring
instinct
of
her
noble
heart
,
she
touched
the
chords
of
my
memory
so
softly
and
harmoniously
,
that
not
one
jarred
within
me
;
I
could
listen
to
the
sorrowful
,
distant
music
,
and
desire
to
shrink
from
nothing
it
awoke
.
 
<EOS>
How
could
I
,
when
,
blended
with
it
all
,
was
her
dear
self
,
the
better
angel
of
my
life
?
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
,
Agnes
,
"
I
said
,
by
and
by
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
of
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
hardly
ever
told
me
of
your
own
life
,
in
all
this
lapse
of
time
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
should
I
tell
?
"
<EOS>
she
answered
,
with
her
radiant
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Papa
is
well
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
us
here
,
quiet
in
our
own
home
;
our
anxieties
set
at
rest
,
our
home
restored
to
us
;
and
knowing
that
,
dear
Trotwood
,
you
know
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
,
Agnes
?
"
said
I.
   
She
looked
at
me
,
with
some
fluttering
wonder
in
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
nothing
else
,
Sister
?
"
I
said
.
   
<EOS>
Her
colour
,
which
had
just
now
faded
,
returned
,
and
faded
again
.
<EOS>
She
smiled
;
with
a
quiet
sadness
,
I
thought
;
and
shook
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
sought
to
lead
her
to
what
my
aunt
had
hinted
at
;
for
,
sharply
painful
to
me
as
it
must
be
to
receive
that
confidence
,
I
was
to
discipline
my
heart
,
and
do
my
duty
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
,
however
,
that
she
was
uneasy
,
and
I
let
it
pass
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
much
to
do
,
dear
Agnes
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
my
school
?
"
said
she
,
looking
up
again
,
in
all
her
bright
composure
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
laborious
,
is
it
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
labour
is
so
pleasant
,
"
she
returned
,
"
that
it
is
scarcely
grateful
in
me
to
call
it
by
that
name
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
good
is
difficult
to
you
,
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
Her
colour
came
and
went
once
more
;
and
once
more
,
as
she
bent
her
head
<EOS>
,
I
saw
the
same
sad
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
wait
and
see
papa
,
"
said
Agnes
,
cheerfully
,
"
and
pass
the
day
with
us
?
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
will
sleep
in
your
own
room
?
 
<EOS>
We
always
call
it
yours
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
do
that
,
having
promised
to
ride
back
to
my
aunt
's
at
night
;
but
I
would
pass
the
day
there
,
joyfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
be
a
prisoner
for
a
little
while
,
"
said
Agnes
,
"
but
here
are
the
old
books
,
Trotwood
,
and
the
old
music
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Even
the
old
flowers
are
here
,
"
said
I
,
looking
round
;
"
or
the
old
kinds
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
found
a
pleasure
,
"
returned
Agnes
,
smiling
,
"
while
you
have
been
absent
,
in
keeping
everything
as
it
used
to
be
when
we
were
children
.
 
<EOS>
For
we
were
very
happy
then
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Heaven
knows
we
were
!
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
And
every
little
thing
that
has
reminded
me
of
my
brother
,
"
said
Agnes
,
with
her
cordial
eyes
turned
cheerfully
upon
me
,
"
has
been
a
welcome
companion
.
 
<EOS>
Even
this
,
"
showing
me
the
basket
-
trifle
,
full
of
keys
,
still
hanging
at
her
side
,
"
seems
to
jingle
a
kind
of
old
tune
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
smiled
again
,
and
went
out
at
the
door
by
which
she
had
come
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
for
me
to
guard
this
sisterly
affection
with
religious
care
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
that
I
had
left
myself
,
and
it
was
a
treasure
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
once
shook
the
foundations
of
the
sacred
confidence
and
usage
,
in
virtue
of
which
<EOS>
it
was
given
to
me
,
it
was
lost
,
and
could
never
be
recovered
.
 
<EOS>
I
set
this
steadily
before
myself
.
 
<EOS>
The
better
I
loved
her
,
the
more
it
behoved
me
never
to
forget
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
walked
through
the
streets
;
and
,
once
more
seeing
my
old
adversary
<EOS>
the
butcher
---
now
a
constable
,
with
his
staff
hanging
up
in
the
shop
---
went
down
to
look
at
the
place
where
I
had
fought
him
;
and
there
meditated
on
Miss
Shepherd
and
the
eldest
Miss
Larkins
,
and
all
the
idle
loves
and
likings
,
and
dislikings
,
of
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
seemed
to
have
survived
that
time
but
Agnes
;
and
she
,
ever
a
star
above
me
,
was
brighter
and
higher
.
   
<EOS>
When
I
returned
,
Mr
Wickfield
had
come
home
,
from
a
garden
he
had
,
a
couple
of
miles
or
so
out
of
town
,
where
he
now
employed
himself
almost
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
him
as
my
aunt
had
described
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
sat
down
to
dinner
,
with
some
half
-
dozen
little
girls
;
and
he
seemed
but
the
shadow
of
his
handsome
picture
on
the
wall
.
   
<EOS>
The
tranquillity
and
peace
belonging
,
of
old
,
to
that
quiet
ground
in
my
memory
,
pervaded
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
When
dinner
was
done
,
Mr
Wickfield
taking
no
wine
,
and
I
desiring
none
,
we
went
up
-
stairs
;
where
Agnes
and
her
little
charges
sang
and
played
,
and
worked
.
<EOS>
After
tea
the
children
left
us
;
and
we
three
sat
together
,
talking
of
the
bygone
days
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
part
in
them
,
"
said
Mr
Wickfield
,
shaking
his
white
head
,
"
has
much
matter
for
regret
---
for
deep
regret
,
and
deep
contrition
,
Trotwood
,
you
well
know
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
would
not
cancel
it
,
if
it
were
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
readily
believe
that
,
looking
at
the
face
beside
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
cancel
with
it
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
such
patience
and
devotion
,
such
fidelity
,
such
a
child
's
love
,
as
I
must
not
forget
,
no
!
<EOS>
even
to
forget
myself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
,
sir
,
"
I
softly
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hold
it
---
I
have
always
held
it
---
in
veneration
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
no
one
knows
,
not
even
you
,
<EOS>
"
he
returned
,
"
how
much
she
has
done
,
how
much
she
has
undergone
,
how
hard
she
has
striven
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Agnes
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
had
put
her
hand
entreatingly
on
his
arm
,
to
stop
him
;
and
was
very
,
very
pale
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
with
a
sigh
,
dismissing
,
as
I
then
saw
,
some
trial
she
had
borne
,
or
was
yet
to
bear
,
in
connexion
with
what
my
aunt
had
told
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
!
I
have
never
told
you
,
Trotwood
,
of
her
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Has
anyone
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
much
---
though
it
was
much
to
suffer
.
 
<EOS>
She
married
me
in
opposition
to
her
father
's
wish
,
and
he
renounced
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
prayed
him
to
forgive
her
,
before
my
Agnes
came
into
this
world
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
very
hard
man
,
and
her
mother
had
long
been
dead
.
 
<EOS>
He
repulsed
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
broke
her
heart
.
"
   
<EOS>
Agnes
leaned
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
stole
her
arm
about
his
neck
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
had
an
affectionate
and
gentle
heart
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
it
was
broken
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
its
tender
nature
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
could
,
if
I
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
She
loved
me
dearly
,
but
was
never
happy
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
always
labouring
,
in
secret
,
under
this
distress
;
and
being
delicate
and
downcast
at
the
time
of
his
last
repulse
---
for
it
was
not
the
first
,
by
many
---
<EOS>
pined
away
and
died
.
 
<EOS>
She
left
me
Agnes
,
two
weeks
old
;
and
the
grey
hair
that
you
recollect
me
with
,
when
you
first
came
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
kissed
Agnes
on
her
cheek
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
love
for
my
dear
child
was
a
diseased
love
,
but
my
mind
was
all
unhealthy
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
no
more
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
speaking
of
myself
,
Trotwood
,
but
of
her
mother
,
and
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
give
you
any
clue
to
what
I
am
,
or
to
what
I
have
been
,
you
will
unravel
it
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
What
Agnes
is
,
I
need
not
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
always
read
something
of
her
poor
mother
's
story
,
in
her
character
;
and
so
I
tell
it
you
tonight
,
when
we
three
are
again
together
,
after
such
great
changes
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
told
it
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
bowed
head
,
and
her
angel
-
face
and
filial
duty
,
derived
a
more
pathetic
meaning
from
it
than
they
had
had
before
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
wanted
anything
by
which
to
mark
this
night
of
our
re
-
union
,
I
should
have
found
it
in
this
.
   
<EOS>
Agnes
rose
up
from
her
father
's
side
,
before
long
;
and
going
softly
to
her
piano
,
played
some
of
the
old
airs
to
which
we
had
often
listened
in
that
place
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
intention
of
going
away
again
?
"
<EOS>
Agnes
asked
me
,
as
I
was
standing
by
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
does
my
sister
say
to
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
have
no
such
intention
,
Agnes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
ought
not
,
Trotwood
,
since
you
ask
me
,
"
she
said
,
mildly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
growing
reputation
and
success
enlarge
your
power
of
doing
good
;
and
if
I
could
spare
my
brother
,
"
with
her
eyes
upon
me
,
"
<EOS>
perhaps
the
time
could
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
I
am
,
you
have
made
me
,
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
You
should
know
best
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
made
you
,
Trotwood
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
Agnes
,
my
dear
girl
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
bending
over
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
tried
to
tell
you
,
when
we
met
today
,
something
that
has
been
in
my
thoughts
since
Dora
died
.
 
<EOS>
You
remember
,
when
you
came
down
to
me
in
our
little
room
---
pointing
upward
,
Agnes
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Trotwood
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
returned
,
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
loving
,
so
confiding
,
and
so
young
!
<EOS>
Can
I
ever
forget
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
you
were
then
,
my
sister
,
I
have
often
thought
since
,
you
have
ever
been
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Ever
pointing
upward
,
Agnes
;
ever
leading
me
to
something
better
;
ever
directing
me
to
higher
things
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
only
shook
her
head
;
through
her
tears
I
saw
the
same
sad
quiet
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
am
so
grateful
to
you
for
it
,
Agnes
,
so
bound
to
you
,
that
there
is
no
name
for
the
affection
of
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
know
,
yet
do
n't
know
how
to
tell
you
,
that
all
my
life
long
<EOS>
I
shall
look
up
to
you
,
and
be
guided
by
you
,
as
I
have
been
through
the
darkness
that
is
past
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
betides
,
whatever
new
ties
you
may
form
,
whatever
changes
may
come
between
us
,
I
shall
always
look
to
you
,
and
love
you
,
as
I
do
now
,
and
have
always
done
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
always
be
my
solace
and
resource
,
as
you
have
always
been
.
 
<EOS>
Until
I
die
,
my
dearest
sister
,
I
shall
see
you
always
before
me
,
pointing
upward
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
put
her
hand
in
mine
,
and
told
me
she
was
proud
of
me
,
and
of
what
I
said
;
although
I
praised
her
very
far
beyond
her
worth
.
<EOS>
Then
she
went
on
softly
playing
,
but
without
removing
her
eyes
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
what
I
have
heard
tonight
,
Agnes
,
"
said
I
,
"
strangely
seems
to
be
a
part
of
the
feeling
with
which
I
regarded
you
when
I
saw
you
first
---
with
which
I
sat
beside
you
in
my
rough
school
-
days
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
knew
I
had
no
mother
,
"
she
replied
with
a
smile
,
"
and
felt
kindly
towards
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
More
than
that
,
Agnes
,
I
knew
,
almost
as
if
I
had
known
this
story
,
that
there
was
something
inexplicably
gentle
and
softened
,
surrounding
you
;
something
that
might
have
been
sorrowful
in
someone
else
(
as
I
can
now
understand
it
was
)
,
but
was
not
so
in
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
softly
played
on
,
looking
at
me
still
.
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
laugh
at
my
cherishing
such
fancies
,
Agnes
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Or
at
my
saying
that
I
really
believe
I
felt
,
even
then
,
that
you
could
be
faithfully
affectionate
against
all
discouragement
,
and
never
cease
to
be
so
,
until
you
ceased
to
live
?
 
<EOS>
---
Will
you
laugh
at
such
a
dream
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
For
an
instant
,
a
distressful
shadow
crossed
her
face
;
but
,
even
in
the
start
it
gave
me
,
it
was
gone
;
and
she
was
playing
on
,
and
looking
at
me
with
her
own
calm
smile
.
   
<EOS>
As
I
rode
back
in
the
lonely
night
,
the
wind
going
by
me
like
a
restless
memory
,
I
thought
of
this
,
and
feared
she
was
not
happy
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
happy
;
but
,
thus
far
,
I
had
faithfully
set
the
seal
upon
the
Past
,
and
,
thinking
of
her
,
pointing
upward
,
thought
of
her
as
pointing
to
that
sky
above
me
,
where
,
in
the
mystery
to
come
,
I
might
yet
love
her
with
a
love
unknown
on
earth
,
and
tell
her
what
the
strife
had
been
within
me
when
I
loved
her
here
.

Chapter

<EOS>
I
am
shown
two
interesting
penitents
 
<EOS>
For
a
time
---
at
all
events
until
my
book
should
be
completed
,
which
would
be
the
work
of
several
months
---
I
took
up
my
abode
in
my
aunt
's
house
at
Dover
;
and
there
,
sitting
in
the
window
from
which
I
had
looked
out
at
the
moon
upon
the
sea
,
when
that
roof
first
gave
me
shelter
,
I
quietly
pursued
my
task
.
   
<EOS>
In
pursuance
of
my
intention
of
referring
to
my
own
fictions
only
when
their
course
should
incidentally
connect
itself
with
the
progress
of
my
story
,
I
do
not
enter
on
the
aspirations
,
the
delights
,
anxieties
,
and
triumphs
of
my
art
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
truly
devoted
myself
to
it
with
my
strongest
earnestness
,
and
bestowed
upon
it
every
energy
of
my
soul
<EOS>
,
I
have
already
said
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
books
I
have
written
be
of
any
worth
,
they
will
supply
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
otherwise
have
written
to
poor
purpose
,
and
the
rest
will
be
of
interest
to
no
one
.
   
<EOS>
Occasionally
,
I
went
to
London
;
to
lose
myself
in
the
swarm
of
life
there
,
or
to
consult
with
Traddles
on
some
business
point
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
managed
for
me
,
in
my
absence
,
with
the
soundest
judgement
;
and
my
worldly
affairs
were
prospering
.
 
<EOS>
As
my
notoriety
began
to
bring
upon
me
an
enormous
quantity
of
letters
from
people
of
whom
I
had
no
knowledge
---
chiefly
about
nothing
,
and
extremely
difficult
to
answer
---
I
agreed
with
Traddles
to
have
my
name
painted
up
on
his
door
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
the
devoted
postman
on
that
beat
delivered
bushels
of
letters
for
me
;
and
there
,
at
intervals
,
I
laboured
through
them
,
like
a
Home
Secretary
of
State
without
the
salary
.
   
<EOS>
Among
this
correspondence
,
there
dropped
in
,
every
now
and
then
,
an
obliging
proposal
from
one
of
the
numerous
outsiders
always
lurking
about
the
Commons
,
to
practise
under
cover
of
my
name
(
if
I
would
take
the
necessary
steps
remaining
to
make
a
proctor
of
myself
)
,
and
pay
me
a
percentage
on
the
profits
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
declined
these
offers
;
being
already
aware
that
there
were
plenty
of
such
covert
practitioners
in
existence
,
and
considering
the
Commons
quite
bad
enough
,
without
my
doing
anything
to
make
it
worse
.
   
<EOS>
The
girls
had
gone
home
,
when
my
name
burst
into
bloom
on
Traddles
's
door
;
and
the
sharp
boy
looked
,
all
day
,
as
if
he
had
never
heard
of
Sophy
,
shut
up
in
a
back
room
,
glancing
down
from
her
work
into
a
sooty
little
strip
of
garden
with
a
pump
in
it
.
<EOS>
But
there
I
always
found
her
,
the
same
bright
housewife
;
often
humming
her
Devonshire
ballads
when
no
strange
foot
was
coming
up
the
stairs
,
and
blunting
the
sharp
boy
in
his
official
closet
with
melody
.
   
<EOS>
I
wondered
,
at
first
,
why
I
so
often
found
Sophy
writing
in
a
copy
-
book
;
and
why
she
always
shut
it
up
when
I
appeared
,
and
hurried
it
into
the
table
-
drawer
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
secret
soon
came
out
.
<EOS>
One
day
,
Traddles
(
who
had
just
come
home
through
the
drizzling
sleet
from
Court
)
took
a
paper
out
of
his
desk
,
and
asked
me
what
I
thought
of
that
handwriting
?
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
DON'T
,
Tom
!
"
cried
Sophy
,
who
was
warming
his
slippers
before
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
returned
Tom
,
in
a
delighted
state
,
"
why
not
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
to
that
writing
,
Copperfield
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
extraordinarily
legal
and
formal
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
ever
saw
such
a
stiff
hand
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
like
a
lady
's
hand
,
is
it
?
"
said
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
lady
's
!
"
I
repeated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bricks
and
mortar
are
more
like
a
lady
's
hand
!
"
   
<EOS>
Traddles
broke
into
a
rapturous
laugh
,
and
informed
me
that
it
was
Sophy
's
writing
;
that
Sophy
had
vowed
and
declared
he
would
need
a
copying
-
clerk
soon
,
and
she
would
be
that
clerk
;
that
she
had
acquired
this
hand
from
a
pattern
;
and
that
she
could
throw
off
---
I
forget
how
many
folios
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Sophy
was
very
much
confused
by
my
being
told
all
this
,
and
said
that
when
"
Tom
"
was
made
a
judge
he
would
n't
be
so
ready
to
proclaim
it
.
 
<EOS>
Which
"
Tom
"
denied
;
averring
that
he
should
always
be
equally
proud
of
it
,
under
all
circumstances
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
thoroughly
good
and
charming
wife
she
is
,
my
dear
Traddles
!
"
<EOS>
said
I
,
when
she
had
gone
away
,
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Copperfield
,
"
returned
Traddles
,
<EOS>
"
she
is
,
without
any
exception
,
the
dearest
girl
!
<EOS>
The
way
she
manages
this
place
;
her
punctuality
,
domestic
knowledge
,
economy
,
and
order
;
her
cheerfulness
,
Copperfield
!
"
   
"
Indeed
,
you
have
reason
to
commend
her
!
<EOS>
"
I
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
happy
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
make
yourselves
,
and
each
other
,
two
of
the
happiest
people
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
we
ARE
two
of
the
happiest
people
,
"
returned
Traddles
.
<EOS>
"
I
admit
that
,
at
all
events
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
my
soul
,
<EOS>
when
I
see
her
getting
up
by
candle
-
light
on
these
dark
mornings
,
busying
herself
in
the
day
's
arrangements
,
going
out
to
market
before
the
clerks
come
into
the
Inn
,
caring
for
no
weather
,
devising
the
most
capital
little
dinners
out
of
the
plainest
materials
,
making
puddings
and
pies
,
keeping
everything
in
its
right
place
,
always
so
neat
and
ornamental
herself
,
sitting
up
at
night
with
me
if
it
's
ever
so
late
,
sweet
-
tempered
and
encouraging
always
,
and
all
for
me
,
I
positively
sometimes
ca
n't
believe
it
,
Copperfield
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
tender
of
the
very
slippers
she
had
been
warming
,
as
he
put
them
on
,
and
stretched
his
feet
enjoyingly
upon
the
fender
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
positively
sometimes
ca
n't
believe
it
,
"
said
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
our
pleasures
!
<EOS>
Dear
me
,
they
are
inexpensive
,
but
they
are
quite
wonderful
!
<EOS>
When
we
are
at
home
here
,
of
an
evening
,
and
shut
the
outer
door
,
and
draw
those
curtains
---
which
she
made
---
where
could
we
be
more
snug
?
 
<EOS>
When
it
's
fine
,
and
we
go
out
for
a
walk
in
the
evening
,
the
streets
abound
in
enjoyment
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
We
look
into
the
glittering
windows
of
the
jewellers
'
shops
;
and
I
show
Sophy
which
of
the
diamond
-
eyed
serpents
,
coiled
up
on
white
satin
rising
grounds
<EOS>
,
I
would
give
her
if
I
could
afford
it
;
and
Sophy
shows
me
which
of
the
gold
watches
that
are
capped
and
jewelled
and
engine
-
turned
,
and
possessed
of
the
horizontal
lever
-
escape
-
movement
,
and
all
sorts
of
things
,
she
would
buy
for
me
if
she
could
afford
it
;
and
we
pick
out
the
spoons
and
forks
,
fish
-
slices
,
butter
-
knives
,
and
sugar
-
tongs
,
we
should
both
prefer
if
we
could
both
afford
it
;
and
really
we
go
away
as
if
we
had
got
them
!
<EOS>
Then
,
when
we
stroll
into
the
squares
,
and
great
streets
,
and
see
a
house
to
let
,
sometimes
we
look
up
at
it
,
and
say
,
how
would
THAT
do
,
if
I
was
made
a
judge
?
 
<EOS>
And
we
parcel
it
out
---
<EOS>
such
a
room
for
us
,
such
rooms
for
the
girls
,
and
so
forth
;
until
we
settle
to
our
satisfaction
that
it
would
do
,
or
it
would
n't
do
,
as
the
case
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
we
go
at
half
-
price
to
the
pit
of
the
theatre
---
<EOS>
the
very
smell
of
which
is
cheap
,
in
my
opinion
,
at
the
money
---
and
there
we
thoroughly
enjoy
the
play
:
which
Sophy
believes
every
word
of
,
and
so
do
I.
 
<EOS>
In
walking
home
,
perhaps
we
buy
a
little
bit
of
something
at
a
cook's
-
shop
,
or
a
little
lobster
at
the
fishmongers
,
and
bring
it
here
,
and
make
a
splendid
supper
,
chatting
about
what
we
have
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
you
know
,
Copperfield
,
if
I
was
Lord
Chancellor
,
we
could
n't
do
this
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
do
something
,
whatever
you
were
,
my
dear
Traddles
,
"
thought
I
,
"
that
would
be
pleasant
and
amiable
.
 
<EOS>
And
by
the
way
,
"
I
said
aloud
,
"
I
suppose
you
never
draw
any
skeletons
now
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
"
replied
Traddles
,
laughing
,
and
reddening
,
"
I
ca
n't
wholly
deny
that
I
do
,
my
dear
Copperfield
.
 
<EOS>
For
being
in
one
of
the
back
rows
of
the
King
's
Bench
the
other
day
,
with
a
pen
in
my
hand
,
the
fancy
came
into
my
head
to
try
how
I
had
preserved
that
accomplishment
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
am
afraid
there
's
a
skeleton
---
in
a
wig
---
on
the
ledge
of
the
desk
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
After
we
had
both
laughed
heartily
,
Traddles
wound
up
by
looking
with
a
smile
at
the
fire
,
and
saying
,
in
his
forgiving
way
,
"
Old
Creakle
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
letter
from
that
old
---
<EOS>
Rascal
here
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
For
I
never
was
less
disposed
to
forgive
him
the
way
he
used
to
batter
Traddles
,
than
when
I
saw
Traddles
so
ready
to
forgive
him
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
From
Creakle
the
schoolmaster
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Among
the
persons
who
are
attracted
to
me
in
my
rising
fame
and
fortune
,
"
said
I
,
looking
over
my
letters
,
"
and
who
discover
that
they
were
always
much
attached
to
me
,
is
the
self
-
same
Creakle
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
a
schoolmaster
now
,
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
retired
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
Middlesex
Magistrate
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
thought
Traddles
might
be
surprised
to
hear
it
,
but
he
was
not
so
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
suppose
he
comes
to
be
a
Middlesex
Magistrate
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
me
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Traddles
,
"
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
answer
that
question
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
voted
for
somebody
,
or
lent
money
to
somebody
,
or
bought
something
of
somebody
,
or
otherwise
obliged
somebody
,
or
jobbed
for
somebody
,
who
knew
somebody
who
got
the
lieutenant
of
the
county
to
nominate
him
for
the
commission
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
the
commission
he
is
,
at
any
rate
,
"
said
I.
 
"
<EOS>
And
he
writes
to
me
here
,
that
he
will
be
glad
to
show
me
,
in
operation
,
the
only
true
system
of
prison
discipline
;
the
only
unchallengeable
way
of
making
sincere
and
lasting
converts
and
penitents
---
which
,
you
know
,
is
by
solitary
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
To
the
system
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Traddles
,
looking
grave
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
To
my
accepting
the
offer
,
and
your
going
with
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
object
,
"
said
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
write
to
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
You
remember
(
to
say
nothing
of
our
treatment
)
this
same
Creakle
turning
his
son
out
of
doors
,
I
suppose
,
and
the
life
he
used
to
lead
his
wife
and
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
,
"
said
Traddles
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yet
,
if
you
'll
read
his
letter
,
you
'll
find
he
is
the
tenderest
of
men
to
prisoners
convicted
of
the
whole
calendar
of
felonies
,
"
said
I
;
"
though
I
ca
n't
find
that
his
tenderness
extends
to
any
other
class
of
created
beings
.
"
   
<EOS>
Traddles
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
was
not
at
all
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
not
expected
him
to
be
,
and
was
not
surprised
myself
;
or
my
observation
of
similar
practical
satires
would
have
been
but
scanty
.
 
<EOS>
We
arranged
the
time
of
our
visit
,
and
I
wrote
accordingly
to
Mr
Creakle
that
evening
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
appointed
day
---
I
think
it
was
the
next
day
,
but
no
matter
---
Traddles
and
I
repaired
to
the
prison
where
Mr
Creakle
was
powerful
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
immense
and
solid
building
,
erected
at
a
vast
expense
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
thinking
,
as
we
approached
the
gate
,
what
an
uproar
would
have
been
made
in
the
country
,
if
any
deluded
man
had
proposed
to
spend
one
half
the
money
it
had
cost
,
on
the
erection
of
an
industrial
school
for
the
young
,
or
a
house
of
refuge
for
the
deserving
old
.
   
<EOS>
In
an
office
that
might
have
been
on
the
ground
-
floor
of
the
Tower
of
Babel
,
it
was
so
massively
constructed
,
we
were
presented
to
our
old
schoolmaster
;
who
was
one
of
a
group
,
composed
of
two
or
three
of
the
busier
sort
of
magistrates
,
and
some
visitors
they
had
brought
.
 
<EOS>
He
received
me
,
like
a
man
who
had
formed
my
mind
in
bygone
years
,
and
had
always
loved
me
tenderly
.
 
<EOS>
On
my
introducing
Traddles
,
Mr
Creakle
expressed
,
in
like
manner
,
but
in
an
inferior
degree
,
that
he
had
always
been
Traddles
's
guide
,
philosopher
,
and
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Our
venerable
instructor
was
a
great
deal
older
,
and
not
improved
in
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
was
as
fiery
as
ever
;
his
eyes
were
as
small
,
and
rather
deeper
set
.
 
<EOS>
The
scanty
,
wet
-
looking
grey
hair
,
by
which
I
remembered
him
,
was
almost
gone
;
and
the
thick
veins
in
his
bald
head
were
none
the
more
agreeable
to
look
at
.
   
<EOS>
After
some
conversation
among
these
gentlemen
,
from
which
I
might
have
supposed
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
to
be
legitimately
taken
into
account
but
the
supreme
comfort
of
prisoners
,
at
any
expense
,
and
nothing
on
the
wide
earth
to
be
done
outside
prison
-
doors
,
we
began
our
inspection
.
 
<EOS>
It
being
then
just
dinner
-
time
,
we
went
,
first
into
the
great
kitchen
,
where
every
prisoner
's
dinner
was
in
course
of
being
set
out
separately
(
to
be
handed
to
him
in
his
cell
)
,
with
the
regularity
and
precision
of
clock
-
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
aside
,
to
Traddles
,
that
I
wondered
whether
it
occurred
to
anybody
,
that
there
was
a
striking
contrast
between
these
plentiful
repasts
of
choice
quality
,
and
the
dinners
,
not
to
say
of
paupers
,
but
of
soldiers
,
sailors
,
labourers
,
the
great
bulk
of
the
honest
,
working
community
;
of
whom
not
one
man
in
five
hundred
<EOS>
ever
dined
half
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
learned
that
the
"
system
"
required
high
living
;
and
,
in
short
,
to
dispose
of
the
system
,
once
for
all
,
I
found
that
on
that
head
and
on
all
others
,
"
the
system
"
put
an
end
to
all
doubts
,
and
disposed
of
all
anomalies
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
appeared
to
have
the
least
idea
that
there
was
any
other
system
,
but
THE
system
,
to
be
considered
.
   
<EOS>
As
we
were
going
through
some
of
the
magnificent
passages
,
I
inquired
of
Mr
Creakle
and
his
friends
what
were
supposed
to
be
the
main
advantages
of
this
all
-
governing
and
universally
over
-
riding
system
?
 
<EOS>
I
found
them
to
be
the
perfect
isolation
of
prisoners
---
so
that
no
one
man
in
confinement
there
,
knew
anything
about
another
;
and
the
reduction
of
prisoners
to
a
wholesome
state
of
mind
,
leading
to
sincere
contrition
and
repentance
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
it
struck
me
,
when
we
began
to
visit
individuals
in
their
cells
,
and
to
traverse
the
passages
in
which
those
cells
were
,
and
to
have
the
manner
of
the
going
to
chapel
and
so
forth
,
explained
to
us
,
that
there
was
a
strong
probability
of
the
prisoners
knowing
a
good
deal
about
each
other
,
and
of
their
carrying
on
a
pretty
complete
system
of
intercourse
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
at
the
time
I
write
,
has
been
proved
,
I
believe
,
to
be
the
case
;
but
,
as
it
would
have
been
flat
blasphemy
against
the
system
to
have
hinted
such
a
doubt
then
,
I
looked
out
for
the
penitence
as
diligently
as
I
could
.
   
<EOS>
And
here
again
,
I
had
great
misgivings
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
as
prevalent
a
fashion
in
the
form
of
the
penitence
,
as
I
had
left
outside
in
the
forms
of
the
coats
and
waistcoats
in
the
windows
of
the
tailors
'
shops
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
a
vast
amount
of
profession
,
varying
very
little
in
character
:
varying
very
little
(
which
I
thought
exceedingly
suspicious
)
,
even
in
words
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
a
great
many
foxes
,
disparaging
whole
vineyards
of
inaccessible
grapes
;
but
I
found
very
few
foxes
whom
I
would
have
trusted
within
reach
of
a
bunch
.
<EOS>
Above
all
,
I
found
that
the
most
professing
men
were
the
greatest
objects
of
interest
;
and
that
their
conceit
,
their
vanity
,
their
want
of
excitement
,
and
their
love
of
deception
(
which
many
of
them
possessed
to
an
almost
incredible
extent
,
as
their
histories
showed
)
,
all
prompted
to
these
professions
,
and
were
all
gratified
by
them
.
   
<EOS>
However
,
I
heard
so
repeatedly
,
in
the
course
of
our
goings
to
and
fro
,
of
a
certain
Number
Twenty
Seven
,
who
was
the
Favourite
,
and
who
really
appeared
to
be
a
Model
Prisoner
,
that
I
resolved
to
suspend
my
judgement
until
I
should
see
Twenty
Seven
.
 
<EOS>
Twenty
Eight
,
I
understood
,
was
also
a
bright
particular
star
;
but
it
was
his
misfortune
to
have
his
glory
a
little
dimmed
by
the
extraordinary
lustre
of
Twenty
Seven
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
so
much
of
Twenty
Seven
,
of
his
pious
admonitions
to
everybody
around
him
,
and
of
the
beautiful
letters
he
constantly
wrote
to
his
mother
(
whom
he
seemed
to
consider
in
a
very
bad
way
)
,
that
I
became
quite
impatient
to
see
him
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
to
restrain
my
impatience
for
some
time
,
on
account
of
Twenty
Seven
being
reserved
for
a
concluding
effect
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
at
last
,
we
came
to
the
door
of
his
cell
;
and
Mr
Creakle
,
looking
through
a
little
hole
in
it
,
reported
to
us
,
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
admiration
,
that
he
was
reading
a
Hymn
Book
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
such
a
rush
of
heads
immediately
,
to
see
Number
Twenty
Seven
reading
his
Hymn
Book
,
that
the
little
hole
was
blocked
up
,
six
or
seven
heads
deep
.
 
<EOS>
To
remedy
this
inconvenience
,
and
give
us
an
opportunity
of
conversing
with
Twenty
Seven
in
all
his
purity
,
Mr
Creakle
directed
the
door
of
the
cell
to
be
unlocked
,
and
Twenty
Seven
to
be
invited
out
into
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
done
;
and
whom
should
Traddles
and
I
then
behold
,
to
our
amazement
,
in
this
converted
Number
Twenty
Seven
,
but
Uriah
Heep
!
   
<EOS>
He
knew
us
directly
;
and
said
,
as
he
came
out
---
with
the
old
writhe
,
---
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
<EOS>
Mr
Copperfield
?
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
,
Mr
Traddles
?
"
   
<EOS>
This
recognition
caused
a
general
admiration
in
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
I
rather
thought
that
everyone
was
struck
by
his
not
being
proud
,
and
taking
notice
of
us
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Twenty
Seven
,
"
said
Mr
Creakle
,
mournfully
admiring
him
.
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
find
yourself
today
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
umble
,
sir
!
"
replied
Uriah
Heep
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
always
so
,
Twenty
Seven
,
"
said
Mr
Creakle
.
   
<EOS>
Here
,
another
gentleman
asked
,
with
extreme
anxiety
:
"
Are
you
quite
comfortable
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
thank
you
,
sir
!
"
said
Uriah
Heep
,
looking
in
that
direction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Far
more
comfortable
here
,
than
ever
I
was
outside
.
<EOS>
I
see
my
follies
,
now
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
makes
me
comfortable
.
"
   
<EOS>
Several
gentlemen
were
much
affected
;
and
a
third
questioner
,
forcing
himself
to
the
front
,
inquired
with
extreme
feeling
:
"
How
do
you
find
the
beef
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
"
replied
Uriah
,
glancing
in
the
new
direction
of
this
voice
,
"
it
was
tougher
yesterday
than
I
could
wish
;
but
it
's
my
duty
to
bear
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
committed
follies
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Uriah
,
looking
round
with
a
meek
smile
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
ought
to
bear
the
consequences
without
repining
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
murmur
,
partly
of
gratification
at
Twenty
Seven
's
celestial
state
of
mind
,
and
partly
of
indignation
against
the
Contractor
who
had
given
him
any
cause
of
complaint
(
a
note
of
which
was
immediately
made
by
Mr
Creakle
)
,
having
subsided
,
Twenty
Seven
stood
in
the
midst
of
us
,
as
if
he
felt
himself
the
principal
object
of
merit
in
a
highly
meritorious
museum
.
 
<EOS>
That
we
,
the
neophytes
,
might
have
an
excess
of
light
shining
upon
us
all
at
once
,
orders
were
given
to
let
out
Twenty
Eight
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
been
so
much
astonished
already
,
that
I
only
felt
a
kind
of
resigned
wonder
when
Mr
Littimer
walked
forth
,
reading
a
good
book
!
   
<EOS>
"
Twenty
Eight
,
"
said
a
gentleman
in
spectacles
,
who
had
not
yet
spoken
,
"
<EOS>
you
complained
last
week
,
my
good
fellow
,
of
the
cocoa
.
<EOS>
How
has
it
been
since
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Littimer
,
"
it
has
been
better
made
.
<EOS>
If
I
might
take
the
liberty
of
saying
so
,
sir
,
I
do
n't
think
the
milk
which
is
boiled
with
it
is
quite
genuine
;
but
I
am
aware
,
sir
,
that
there
is
a
great
adulteration
of
milk
,
in
London
,
and
that
the
article
in
a
pure
state
is
difficult
to
be
obtained
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
appeared
to
me
that
the
gentleman
in
spectacles
backed
his
Twenty
Eight
against
Mr
Creakle
's
Twenty
Seven
,
for
each
of
them
took
his
own
man
in
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
state
of
mind
,
Twenty
Eight
?
"
said
the
questioner
in
spectacles
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Littimer
;
"
I
see
my
follies
now
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
good
deal
troubled
when
I
think
of
the
sins
of
my
former
companions
,
sir
;
but
I
trust
they
may
find
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
happy
yourself
?
"
said
the
questioner
,
nodding
encouragement
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Littimer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anything
at
all
on
your
mind
now
?
"
said
the
questioner
.
<EOS>
"
If
so
,
mention
it
,
Twenty
Eight
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Littimer
,
without
looking
up
,
"
if
my
eyes
have
not
deceived
me
,
there
is
a
gentleman
present
who
was
acquainted
with
me
in
my
former
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
profitable
to
that
gentleman
to
know
,
sir
,
that
I
attribute
my
past
follies
,
entirely
to
having
lived
a
thoughtless
life
in
the
service
of
young
men
;
and
to
having
allowed
myself
to
be
led
by
them
into
weaknesses
,
which
I
had
not
the
strength
to
resist
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
that
gentleman
will
take
warning
,
sir
,
and
will
not
be
offended
at
my
freedom
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
for
his
good
.
<EOS>
I
am
conscious
of
my
own
past
follies
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
he
may
repent
of
all
the
wickedness
and
sin
to
which
he
has
been
a
party
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
observed
that
several
gentlemen
were
shading
their
eyes
,
each
with
one
hand
,
as
if
they
had
just
come
into
church
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
does
you
credit
,
Twenty
Eight
,
"
returned
the
questioner
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
expected
it
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
else
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Littimer
,
slightly
lifting
up
his
eyebrows
,
but
not
his
eyes
,
"
there
was
a
young
woman
who
fell
into
dissolute
courses
,
that
I
endeavoured
to
save
,
sir
,
but
could
not
rescue
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
that
gentleman
,
if
he
has
it
in
his
power
,
to
inform
that
young
woman
from
me
that
I
forgive
her
her
bad
conduct
towards
myself
,
and
that
I
call
her
to
repentance
---
if
he
will
be
so
good
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
,
Twenty
Eight
,
"
returned
the
questioner
,
"
that
the
gentleman
you
refer
to
feels
very
strongly
---
as
we
all
must
---
what
you
have
so
properly
said
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
not
detain
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Littimer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
I
wish
you
a
good
day
,
and
hoping
you
and
your
families
will
also
see
your
wickedness
,
and
amend
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
this
,
Number
Twenty
Eight
retired
,
after
a
glance
between
him
and
Uriah
;
as
if
they
were
not
altogether
unknown
to
each
other
,
through
some
medium
of
communication
;
and
a
murmur
went
round
the
group
,
as
his
door
shut
upon
him
,
that
he
was
a
most
respectable
man
,
and
a
beautiful
case
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Twenty
Seven
,
"
said
Mr
Creakle
,
entering
on
a
clear
stage
with
his
man
,
"
is
there
anything
that
anyone
can
do
for
you
?
 
<EOS>
If
so
,
mention
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
umbly
ask
,
sir
,
"
returned
Uriah
,
with
a
jerk
of
his
malevolent
head
,
"
for
leave
to
write
again
to
mother
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
shall
certainly
be
granted
,
"
said
Mr
Creakle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
!
<EOS>
I
am
anxious
about
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
she
ai
n't
safe
.
"
   
<EOS>
Somebody
incautiously
asked
,
what
from
?
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
scandalized
whisper
of
"
Hush
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Immortally
safe
,
sir
,
"
returned
Uriah
,
writhing
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
wish
mother
to
be
got
into
my
state
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
should
have
been
got
into
my
present
state
if
I
had
n't
come
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
mother
had
come
here
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
better
for
everybody
,
if
they
got
took
up
,
and
was
brought
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
sentiment
gave
unbounded
satisfaction
---
greater
satisfaction
,
I
think
,
than
anything
that
had
passed
yet
.
   
<EOS>
"
Before
I
come
here
,
"
said
Uriah
,
stealing
a
look
at
us
,
as
if
he
would
have
blighted
the
outer
world

of
my

You

said
Mr
Creakle

"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
,
yes
,
sir

"
cried
this
hopeful
penitent
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
relapse
,
if
you
were

out

asked
somebody

Oh

"
   
<EOS>
"
Well

"
said
Mr
Creakle
,
"
this
is
very
gratifying

<EOS>
You
have
addressed

Seven

anything

<EOS>
"
You
knew
me
,
a
long
time
before
I
came
here
and
was
changed

Mr
Copperfield

"
said
Uriah
,
looking
at
me
;
and
a
more
villainous
look
I
never
saw
,
even
on
his
visage
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
knew
me
when
,
in
spite
of
my
follies
,
I
was
umble
among
them
that
was
proud
,
and
meek
among
them

that
was
violent

you
was
violent
to
me
yourself
,
Mr
Copperfield

Once

you
struck
me
a
blow
in
the
face

you
know

<EOS>
General
commiseration
.
 
<EOS>
Several
indignant
glances
directed
at
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
forgive
you
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
"
said
Uriah
,
making
his
forgiving
nature
the
subject
of
a
most
impious
and
awful
parallel
,
which
I
shall
not
record
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
forgive
everybody
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
ill
become
me
to
bear
malice

<EOS>
I
freely
forgive
you
,
and
I
hope
you
'll
curb
your
passions
in

<EOS>
I
hope
Mr
W
will
repent
,
and
Miss
W
,
and
all
of
that
sinful
lot

<EOS>
You
've
been
visited
with
affliction

I

it
may
do
you
good

you

have
come
here

<EOS>
Mr
W
had
better
have
come
here
,
and
Miss
W
too
.
 
<EOS>
The
best
wish
I
could
give
you
,
Mr
Copperfield
,
and
give
all
of
you
gentlemen
,
is
,
that
you
could
be
took
up
and
brought
here
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
think
of
my
past
follies
,
and
my
present
state
,
I
am
sure
it
would
be
best
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
pity
all
who
ai
n't
brought
here

"
   
<EOS>
He
sneaked
back
into
his
cell
,
amidst
a
little
chorus
of
approbation
;
and
both
Traddles
and
I
experienced
a
great
relief
when
he
was
locked
in
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
characteristic
feature
in
this
repentance
,
that
I
was
fain
to
ask
what
these
two
men
had
done
,
to
be
there
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
That
appeared
to
be
the
last
thing
about
which
they
had
anything
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
addressed
myself
to
one
of
the
two
warders
,
who
,
I
suspected
from
certain
latent
indications
in
their
faces
,
knew
pretty
well
what
all
this
stir
was
worth
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
"
said
I
,
as
we
walked
along
the
passage
,
"
what
felony
was
Number
Twenty
Seven
's
last
"
folly
"
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
answer
was
that
it
was
a
Bank
case
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
fraud
on
the
Bank
of
England
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes

<EOS>
Fraud

forgery

and
conspiracy

<EOS>
He
and
some
others

He
set
the
others
on

It
was
a
deep

a
large
sum

Sentence

transportation
for

<EOS>
Twenty
Seven
was
the
knowingest
bird
of
the
lot
,
and
had
very
nearly
kept
himself
safe
;
but
not
quite
.

The
Bank
was
just
able

put
salt
upon

only
just

"
Twenty
Eight

"
returned
my
informant
,
speaking
throughout
in
a
low
tone
,
and
looking
over
his
shoulder
as
we
walked
along
the
passage
,
to
guard
himself
from
being
overheard
,
in
such
an
unlawful
reference
to
these
Immaculates
,
by
Creakle
and
the
rest
;
"
Twenty
Eight
(
also
transportation
)
got
a
place
,
and
robbed
a
young
master
of
a
matter
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
in
money
and
valuables
,
the
night
before
they
were
going
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
I
particularly
recollect
his
case
,
from
his
being
took
by
a
dwarf
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
what
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
little
woman
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
forgot
her
name
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Not
Mowcher
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
!
<EOS>
He
had
eluded
pursuit
,
and
was
going
to
America
in
a
flaxen
wig
,
and
whiskers
,
and
such
a
complete
disguise
as
never
you
see
in
all
your
born
days
;
when
the
little
woman
,
being
in
Southampton
,
met
him
walking
along
the
street
---
picked
him
out
with
her
sharp
eye
in
a
moment
---
ran
betwixt
his
legs
to
upset
him
---
and
held
on
to
him
like
grim
Death
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Excellent
Miss
Mowcher
!
"
cried
I.
   
<EOS>
"
You
'd
have
said
so
,
if
you
had
seen
her
,
standing
on
a
chair
in
the
witness
-
box
at
the
trial
,
as
I
did
,
"
said
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
cut
her
face
right
open
,
and
pounded
her
in
the
most
brutal
manner
,
when
she
took
him
;
but
she
never
loosed
her
hold
till
he
was
locked
up
.
 
<EOS>
She
held
so
tight
to
him
,
in
fact
,
that
the
officers
were
obliged
to
take
'em
both
together
.
 
<EOS>
She
gave
her
evidence
in
the
gamest
way
,
and
was
highly
complimented
by
the
Bench
,
and
cheered
right
home
to
her
lodgings
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
in
Court
that
she
'd
have
took
him
single
-
handed
(
on
account
of
what
she
knew
concerning
him
)
,
if
he
had
been
Samson
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
's
my
belief
she
would
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
mine
too
,
and
I
highly
respected
Miss
Mowcher
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
We
had
now
seen
all
there
was
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
in
vain
to
represent
to
such
a
man
as
the
Worshipful
Mr
Creakle
,
that
Twenty
Seven
and
Twenty
Eight
were
perfectly
consistent
and
unchanged
;
that
exactly
what
they
were
then
,
they
had
always
been
;
that
the
hypocritical
knaves
were
just
the
subjects
to
make
that
sort
of
profession
in
such
a
place
;
that
they
knew
its
market
-
value
at
least
as
well
as
we
did
,
in
the
immediate
service
it
would
do
them
when
they
were
expatriated
;
in
a
word
,
that
it
was
a
rotten
,
hollow
,
painfully
suggestive
piece
of
business
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
We
left
them
to
their
system
and
themselves
,
and
went
home
wondering
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
's
a
good
thing
,
Traddles

"
said
I
,
"
to
have
an
unsound
Hobby
ridden
hard
;
for
it
's
the
sooner
ridden
to
death

<EOS>
"
I
hope
so

replied
Traddles

<EOS>
A
light
shines
on
my
way
 
<EOS>
The
year
came
round
to
Christmas
-
time
,
and
I
had
been
at
home
above
two
months
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
seen
Agnes
frequently
.
 
<EOS>
However
loud
the
general
voice
might
be
in
giving
me
encouragement
,
and
however
fervent
the
emotions
and
endeavours
to
which
it
roused
me
<EOS>
,
I
heard
her
lightest
word
of
praise
as
I
heard
nothing
else
.
   
<EOS>
At
least
once
a
week
,
and
sometimes
oftener
,
I
rode
over
there
,
and
passed
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
usually
rode
back
at
night
;
for
the
old
unhappy
sense
was
always
hovering
about
me
now
---
most
sorrowfully
when
I
left
her
---
and
I
was
glad
to
be
up
and
out
,
rather
than
wandering
over
the
past
in
weary
wakefulness
or
miserable
dreams
.
<EOS>
I
wore
away
the
longest
part
of
many
wild
sad
nights
,
in
those
rides
;
reviving
,
as
I
went
,
the
thoughts
that
had
occupied
me
in
my
long
absence
.
   
<EOS>
Or
,
if
I
were
to
say
rather
that
I
listened
to
the
echoes
of
those
thoughts
,
I
should
better
express
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
They
spoke
to
me
from
afar
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
put
them
at
a
distance
,
and
accepted
my
inevitable
place
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
read
to
Agnes
what
I
wrote
;
when
I
saw
her
listening
face
;
moved
her
to
smiles
or
tears
;
and
heard
her
cordial
voice
so
earnest
on
the
shadowy
events
of
that
imaginative
world
in
which
I
lived
<EOS>
;
I
thought
what
a
fate
mine
might
have
been
---
but
only
thought
so
,
as
I
had
thought
after
I
was
married
to
Dora
<EOS>
,
what
I
could
have
wished
my
wife
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
My
duty
to
Agnes
,
who
loved
me
with
a
love
,
which
,
if
I
disquieted
,
I
wronged
most
selfishly
and
poorly
,
and
could
never
restore
;
my
matured
assurance
that
I
,
who
had
worked
out
my
own
destiny
,
and
won
what
I
had
impetuously
set
my
heart
on
,
had
no
right
to
murmur
,
and
must
bear
;
comprised
what
I
felt
and
what
I
had
learned
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
loved
her
:
and
now
it
even
became
some
consolation
to
me
,
vaguely
to
conceive
a
distant
day
when
I
might
blamelessly
avow
it
;
when
all
this
should
be
over
;
when
I
could
say
"
Agnes
,
so
it
was
when
I
came
home
;
and
now
I
am
old
,
and
I
never
have
loved
since
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
did
not
once
show
me
any
change
in
herself
.
 
<EOS>
What
she
always
had
been
to
me
,
she
still
was
;
wholly
unaltered
.
   
<EOS>
Between
my
aunt
and
me
there
had
been
something
,
in
this
connexion
,
since
the
night
of
my
return
,
which
I
can
not
call
a
restraint
,
or
an
avoidance
of
the
subject
,
so
much
as
an
implied
understanding
that
we
thought
of
it
together
,
but
did
not
shape
our
thoughts
into
words
.
 
<EOS>
When
,
according
to
our
old
custom
,
we
sat
before
the
fire
at
night
,
we
often
fell
into
this
train
;
as
naturally
,
and
as
consciously
to
each
other
,
as
if
we
had
unreservedly
said
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
preserved
an
unbroken
silence
.
 
<EOS>
I
believed
that
she
had
read
,
or
partly
read
,
my
thoughts
that
night
;
and
that
she
fully
comprehended
why
I
gave
mine
no
more
distinct
expression
.
   
<EOS>
This
Christmas
-
time
being
come
,
and
Agnes
having
reposed
no
new
confidence
in
me
,
a
doubt
that
had
several
times
arisen
in
my
mind
---
whether
she
could
have
that
perception
of
the
true
state
of
my
breast
,
which
restrained
her
with
the
apprehension
of
giving
me
pain
---
began
to
oppress
me
heavily
.
 
<EOS>
If
that
were
so
,
my
sacrifice
was
nothing
;
my
plainest
obligation
to
her
unfulfilled
;
and
every
poor
action
I
had
shrunk
from
,
I
was
hourly
doing
.
 
<EOS>
I
resolved
to
set
this
right
beyond
all
doubt
;
---
if
such
a
barrier
were
between
us
,
to
break
it
down
at
once
with
a
determined
hand
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
---
what
lasting
reason
have
I
to
remember
it
!
---
<EOS>
a
cold
,
harsh
,
winter
day
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
been
snow
,
some
hours
before
;
and
it
lay
,
not
deep
,
but
hard
-
frozen
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Out
at
sea
,
beyond
my
window
,
the
wind
blew
ruggedly
from
the
north
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
been
thinking
of
it
,
sweeping
over
those
mountain
wastes
of
snow
in
Switzerland
,
then
inaccessible
to
any
human
foot
;
and
had
been
speculating
which
was
the
lonelier
,
those
solitary
regions
,
or
a
deserted
ocean
.
   
<EOS>
"
Riding
today
,
Trot
?
"
said
my
aunt
,
putting
her
head
in
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
I
,
"
I
am
going
over
to
Canterbury
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
good
day
for
a
ride
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
your
horse
may
think
so
too
,
"
said
my
aunt
;
"
but
at
present
he
is
holding
down
his
head
and
his
ears
,
standing
before
the
door
there
,
as
if
he
thought
his
stable
preferable
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
I
may
observe
,
allowed
my
horse
on
the
forbidden
ground
,
but
had
not
at
all
relented
towards
the
donkeys
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
fresh
enough
,
presently
!
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
The
ride
will
do
his
master
good
,
at
all
events
,
"
observed
my
aunt
,
glancing
at
the
papers
on
my
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
child
,
you
pass
a
good
many
hours
here
!
<EOS>
I
never
thought
,
when
I
used
to
read
books
,
what
work
it
was
to
write
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
work
enough
to
read
them
,
sometimes
,
"
I
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
to
the
writing
,
it
has
its
own
charms
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
see
!
"
said
my
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ambition
,
love
of
approbation
,
sympathy
,
and
much
more
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
?
 
<EOS>
Well
:
go
along
with
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
anything
more
,
"
said
I
,
standing
composedly
before
her
<EOS>
---
she
had
patted
me
on
the
shoulder
,
and
sat
down
in
my
chair
---
"
of
that
attachment
of
Agnes
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
looked
up
in
my
face
a
little
while
,
before
replying
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
do
,
Trot
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
confirmed
in
your
impression
?

"
I
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
am

Trot

"
   
<EOS>
She
looked
so
steadfastly
at
me
:
with
a
kind
of
doubt
,
or
pity
,
or
suspense
in
her
affection
:
<EOS>
that
I
summoned
the
stronger
determination
to
show
her
a
perfectly
cheerful
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
is
more
,
Trot
---
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
Agnes
is
going
to
be
married
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
her
!
"
<EOS>
said
I
,
cheerfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
her
!
"
<EOS>
said
my
aunt
,
"
and
her
husband
too
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
echoed
it
,
parted
from
my
aunt
,
and
went
lightly
downstairs
,
mounted
,
and
rode
away
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
greater
reason
than
before
to
do
what
I
had
resolved
to
do
.
   
<EOS>
How
well
I
recollect
the
wintry
ride
!
<EOS>
The
frozen
particles
of
ice
,
brushed
from
the
blades
of
grass
by
the
wind
,
and
borne
across
my
face
;
the
hard
clatter
of
the
horse
's
hoofs
,
beating
a
tune
upon
the
ground
;
the
stiff
-
tilled
soil
;
the
snowdrift
,
lightly
eddying
in
the
chalk
-
pit
as
the
breeze
ruffled
it
;
the
smoking
team
with
the
waggon
of
old
hay
,
stopping
to
breathe
on
the
hill
-
top
,
and
shaking
their
bells
musically
;
the
whitened
slopes
and
sweeps
of
Down
-
land
lying
against
the
dark
sky
,
as
if
they
were
drawn
on
a
huge
slate
!
   
<EOS>
I
found
Agnes
alone
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
girls
had
gone
to
their
own
homes
now
,
and
she
was
alone
by
the
fire
,
reading
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
down
her
book
on
seeing
me
come
in
;
and
having
welcomed
me
as
usual
,
took
her
work
-
basket
and
sat
in
one
of
the
old
-
fashioned
windows
.
   
<EOS>
I
sat
beside
her
on
the
window
-
seat
,
and
we
talked
of
what
I
was
doing
,
and
when
it
would
be
done
,
and
of
the
progress
I
had
made
since
my
last
visit
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
was
very
cheerful
;
and
laughingly
predicted
that
I
should
soon
become
too
famous
to
be
talked
to
,
on
such
subjects
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
make
the
most
of
the
present
time
,
you
see
,
"
said
Agnes
,
"
and
talk
to
you
while
I
may
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
I
looked
at
her
beautiful
face
,
observant
of
her
work
,
she
raised
her
mild
clear
eyes
,
and
saw
that
I
was
looking
at
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
thoughtful
today
,
Trotwood
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Agnes
,
shall
I
tell
you
what
about
?
 
<EOS>
I
came
to
tell
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
put
aside
her
work
,
as
she
was
used
to
do
when
we
were
seriously
discussing
anything
;
and
gave
me
her
whole
attention
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Agnes
,
do
you
doubt
my
being
true
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
<EOS>
she
answered
,
with
a
look
of
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
doubt
my
being
what
I
always
have
been
to
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
<EOS>
she
answered
,
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remember
that
I
tried
to
tell
you
,
when
I
came
home
,
what
a
debt
of
gratitude
I
owed
you
,
dearest
Agnes
,
and
how
fervently
I
felt
towards
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
remember
it
,
"
she
said
,
gently
,
"
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
secret
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
share
it
,
Agnes
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
cast
down
her
eyes
,
and
trembled
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
hardly
fail
to
know
,
even
if
I
had
not
heard
---
but
from
other
lips
than
yours
,
Agnes
,
which
seems
strange
---
that
there
is
someone
upon
whom
you
have
bestowed
the
treasure
of
your
love
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
shut
me
out
of
what
concerns
your
happiness
so
nearly
!
<EOS>
If
you
can
trust
me
,
as
you
say
you
can
,
and
as
I
know
you
may
,
let
me
be
your
friend
,
your
brother
,
in
this
matter
,
of
all
others
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
an
appealing
,
almost
a
reproachful
,
glance
,
she
rose
from
the
window
;
and
hurrying
across
the
room
as
if
without
knowing
where
,
put
her
hands
before
her
face
,
and
burst
into
such
tears
as
smote
me
to
the
heart
.
   
<EOS>
And
yet
they
awakened
something
in
me
,
bringing
promise
to
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Without
my
knowing
why
,
these
tears
allied
themselves
with
the
quietly
sad
smile
which
was
so
fixed
in
my
remembrance
,
and
shook
me
more
with
hope
than
fear
or
sorrow
.
   
<EOS>
"
Agnes
!
<EOS>
Sister
!
<EOS>
Dearest
!
<EOS>
What
have
I
done
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
away
,
Trotwood
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
speak
to
you
by
and
by
---
another
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
write
to
you
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
speak
to
me
now
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
!
<EOS>
do
n't
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
sought
to
recollect
what
she
had
said
,
when
I
had
spoken
to
her
on
that
former
night
,
of
her
affection
needing
no
return
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
a
very
world
that
I
must
search
through
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Agnes
,
I
can
not
bear
to
see
you
so
,
and
think
that
I
have
been
the
cause
.
 
<EOS>
My
dearest
girl
,
dearer
to
me
than
anything
in
life
,
if
you
are
unhappy
,
let
me
share
your
unhappiness
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
are
in
need
of
help
or
counsel
,
let
me
try
to
give
it
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
indeed
a
burden
on
your
heart
,
let
me
try
to
lighten
it
.
 
<EOS>
For
whom
do
I
live
now
,
Agnes
,
if
it
is
not
for
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
spare
me
!
<EOS>
I
am
not
myself
!
<EOS>
Another
time
!
<EOS>
"
was
all
I
could
distinguish
.
   
<EOS>
Was
it
a
selfish
error
that
was
leading
me
away
?
 
<EOS>
Or
,
having
once
a
clue
to
hope
,
was
there
something
opening
to
me
that
I
had
not
dared
to
think
of
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
let
you
leave
me
so
!
<EOS>
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
Agnes
,
let
us
not
mistake
each
other
after
all
these
years
,
and
all
that
has
come
and
gone
with
them
!
<EOS>
I
must
speak
plainly
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
lingering
thought
that
I
could
envy
the
happiness
you
will
confer
;
that
I
could
not
resign
you
to
a
dearer
protector
,
of
your
own
choosing
;
that
I
could
not
,
from
my
removed
place
,
be
a
contented
witness
of
your
joy
;
dismiss
it
,
for
I
do
n't
deserve
it
!
<EOS>
I
have
not
suffered
quite
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
not
taught
me
quite
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
alloy
of
self
in
what
I
feel
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
quiet
now
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
little
time
,
she
turned
her
pale
face
towards
me
,
and
said
in
a
low
voice
,
broken
here
and
there
,
but
very
clear
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
owe
it
to
your
pure
friendship
for
me
,
Trotwood
---
which
,
indeed
,
I
do
not
doubt
---
to
tell
you
,
you
are
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
do
no
more
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
sometimes
,
in
the
course
of
years
,
wanted
help
and
counsel
,
they
have
come
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
have
sometimes
been
unhappy
,
the
feeling
has
passed
away
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
have
ever
had
a
burden
on
my
heart
,
it
has
been
lightened
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
have
any
secret
,
it
is
---
no
new
one
;
and
is
---
not
what
you
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
reveal
it
,
or
divide
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
long
been
mine
,
and
must
remain
mine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Agnes
!
<EOS>
Stay
!
<EOS>
A
moment
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
going
away
,
but
I
detained
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
clasped
my
arm
about
her
waist
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
course
of
years
!
"
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
a
new
one
!
"
<EOS>
New
thoughts
and
hopes
were
whirling
through
my
mind
,
and
all
the
colours
of
my
life
were
changing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dearest
Agnes
!
<EOS>
Whom
I
so
respect
and
honour
---
whom
I
so
devotedly
love
!
<EOS>
When
I
came
here
today
,
I
thought
that
nothing
could
have
wrested
this
confession
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
could
have
kept
it
in
my
bosom
all
our
lives
,
till
we
were
old
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Agnes
,
if
I
have
indeed
any
new
-
born
hope
that
I
may
ever
call
you
something
more
than
Sister
,
widely
different
from
Sister
!
---
"
   
Her
tears
fell
fast
;
but
they
were
not
like
those
she
had
lately
shed
,
and
I
saw
my
hope
brighten
in
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Agnes
!
<EOS>
Ever
my
guide
,
and
best
support
!
<EOS>
If
you
had
been
more
mindful
of
yourself
,
and
less
of
me
,
when
we
grew
up
here
together
,
I
think
my
heedless
fancy
never
would
have
wandered
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
were
so
much
better
than
I
,
so
necessary
to
me
in
every
boyish
hope
and
disappointment
,
that
to
have
you
to
confide
in
,
and
rely
upon
in
everything
,
became
a
second
nature
,
supplanting
for
the
time
the
first
and
greater
one
of
loving
you
as
I
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
Still
weeping
,
but
not
sadly
---
joyfully
!
<EOS>
And
clasped
in
my
arms
as
she
had
never
been
,
as
I
had
thought
she
never
was
to
be
!
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
loved
Dora
---
fondly
,
Agnes
,
as
you
know
---
"
   
"
Yes
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
know
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
loved
her
---
even
then
,
my
love
would
have
been
incomplete
,
without
your
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
it
,
and
it
was
perfected
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
lost
her
,
Agnes
,
what
should
I
have
been
without
you
,
still
!
"
   
<EOS>
Closer
in
my
arms
,
nearer
to
my
heart
,
<EOS>
her
trembling
hand
upon
my
shoulder
,
her
sweet
eyes
shining
through
her
tears
,
on
mine
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
went
away
,
dear
Agnes
,
loving
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
stayed
away
,
loving
you
.
<EOS>
I
returned
home
,
loving
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
And
now
,
I
tried
to
tell
her
of
the
struggle
I
had
had
,
and
the
conclusion
I
had
come
to
.
 
<EOS>
I
tried
to
lay
my
mind
before
her
,
truly
,
and
entirely
.
 
<EOS>
I
tried
to
show
her
how
I
had
hoped
I
had
come
into
the
better
knowledge
of
myself
and
of
her
;
how
I
had
resigned
myself
to
what
that
better
knowledge
brought
;
and
how
I
had
come
there
,
even
that
day
,
in
my
fidelity
to
this
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
did
so
love
me
(
I
said
)
that
she
could
take
me
for
her
husband
<EOS>
,
she
could
do
so
,
on
no
deserving
of
mine
,
except
upon
the
truth
of
my
love
for
her
,
and
the
trouble
in
which
it
had
ripened
to
be
what
it
was
;
and
hence
it
was
that
I
revealed
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
O
,
Agnes
,
even
out
of
thy
true
eyes
,
in
that
same
time
,
the
spirit
of
my
child
-
wife
looked
upon
me
,
saying
it
was
well
;
and
winning
me
,
through
thee
,
to
tenderest
recollections
of
the
Blossom
that
had
withered
in
its
bloom
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
blest
,
Trotwood
---
my
heart
is
so
overcharged
---
but
there
is
one
thing
I
must
say
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dearest
,
what
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
laid
her
gentle
hands
upon
my
shoulders
,
and
looked
calmly
in
my
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
yet
,
what
it
is
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
to
speculate
on
what
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
loved
you
all
my
life
!
"
   
<EOS>
O
,
we
were
happy
,
we
were
happy
!
<EOS>
Our
tears
were
not
for
the
trials
(
hers
so
much
the
greater
)
through
which
we
had
come
to
be
thus
,
but
for
the
rapture
of
being
thus
,
never
to
be
divided
more
!
   
<EOS>
We
walked
,
that
winter
evening
,
in
the
fields
together
;
and
<EOS>
the
blessed
calm
within
us
seemed
to
be
partaken
by
the
frosty
air
.
<EOS>
The
early
stars
began
to
shine
while
we
were
lingering
on
,
and
looking
up
to
them
,
we
thanked
our
GOD
for
having
guided
us
to
this
tranquillity
.
   
<EOS>
We
stood
together
in
the
same
old
-
fashioned
window
at
night
,
when
the
moon
was
shining
;
Agnes
with
her
quiet
eyes
raised
up
to
it
;
I
following
her
glance
.
 
<EOS>
Long
miles
of
road
then
opened
out
before
my
mind
;
and
,
toiling
on
,
I
saw
a
ragged
way
-
worn
boy
,
forsaken
and
neglected
,
who
should
come
to
call
even
the
heart
now
beating
against
mine
,
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
nearly
dinner
-
time
next
day
when
we
appeared
before
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
She
was
up
in
my
study
,
Peggotty
said
:
which
it
was
her
pride
to
keep
in
readiness
and
order
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
found
her
,
in
her
spectacles
,
sitting
by
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
Goodness
me
!
"
<EOS>
said
my
aunt
,
peering
through
the
dusk
,
"
who
's
this
you
're
bringing
home
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Agnes
,
"
said
I.
   
As
we
had
arranged
to
say
nothing
at
first
,
my
aunt
was
not
a
little
discomfited
.
 
<EOS>
She
darted
a
hopeful
glance
at
me
,
when
I
said
"
Agnes
"
;
but
seeing
that
I
looked
as
usual
,
she
took
off
her
spectacles
in
despair
,
and
rubbed
her
nose
with
them
.
   
<EOS>
She
greeted
Agnes
heartily
,
nevertheless
;
and
we
were
soon
in
the
lighted
parlour
downstairs
,
at
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
put
on
her
spectacles
twice
or
thrice
,
to
take
another
look
at
me
,
but
as
often
took
them
off
again
,
disappointed
,
and
rubbed
her
nose
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
Much
to
the
discomfiture
of
Mr
Dick
,
who
knew
this
to
be
a
bad
symptom
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
the
by
,
aunt
,
"
said
I
,
after
dinner
;
"
I
have
been
speaking
to
Agnes
about
what
you
told
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Trot
,
"
said
my
aunt
,
turning
scarlet
,
"
you
did
wrong
,
and
broke
your
promise
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
angry
,
aunt
,
I
trust
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
wo
n't
be
,
when
you
learn
that
Agnes
is
not
unhappy
in
any
attachment
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stuff
and
nonsense
!
"
said
my
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
As
my
aunt
appeared
to
be
annoyed
,
I
thought
the
best
way
was
to
cut
her
annoyance
short
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
Agnes
in
my
arm
to
the
back
of
her
chair
,
and
we
both
leaned
over
her
.
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
with
one
clap
of
her
hands
,
and
one
look
through
her
spectacles
,
immediately
went
into
hysterics
,
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
all
my
knowledge
of
her
.
   
<EOS>
The
hysterics
called
up
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
The
moment
my
aunt
was
restored
<EOS>
,
she
flew
at
Peggotty
,
and
calling
her
a
silly
old
creature
,
hugged
her
with
all
her
might
.
 
<EOS>
After
that
,
she
hugged
Mr
Dick
(
who
was
highly
honoured
,
but
a
good
deal
surprised
)
;
and
after
that
,
told
them
why
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
we
were
all
happy
together
.
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
discover
whether
my
aunt
,
in
her
last
short
conversation
with
me
,
had
fallen
on
a
pious
fraud
,
or
had
really
mistaken
the
state
of
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
enough
,
she
said
,
that
she
had
told
me
Agnes
was
going
to
be
married
;
and
that
I
now
knew
better
than
anyone
how
true
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
We
were
married
within
a
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
and
Sophy
,
and
Doctor
and
Mrs
Strong
,
were
the
only
guests
at
our
quiet
wedding
.
 
<EOS>
We
left
them
full
of
joy
;
and
drove
away
together
.
 
<EOS>
Clasped
in
my
embrace
,
I
held
the
source
of
every
worthy
aspiration
I
had
ever
had
;
the
centre
of
myself
,
the
circle
of
my
life
,
my
own
,
my
wife
;
my
love
of
whom
was
founded
on
a
rock
!
   
<EOS>
"
Dearest
husband
!
"
said
Agnes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
that
I
may
call
you
by
that
name
,
I
have
one
thing
more
to
tell
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
hear
it
,
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
grows
out
of
the
night
when
Dora
died
.
 
<EOS>
She
sent
you
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
told
me
that
she
left
me
something
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
think
what
it
was
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
believed
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
I
drew
the
wife
who
had
so
long
loved
me
,
closer
to
my
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
told
me
that
she
made
a
last
request
to
me
,
and
left
me
a
last
charge
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
it
was
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
That
only
I
would
occupy
this
vacant
place
.
"
   
<EOS>
And
Agnes
laid
her
head
upon
my
breast
,
and
wept
;
and
I
wept
with
her
,
though
we
were
so
happy
.
      
Chapter

<EOS>
A
visitor
 
<EOS>
What
I
have
purposed
to
record
is
nearly
finished
;
but
there
is
yet
an
incident
conspicuous
in
my
memory
,
on
which
it
often
rests
with
delight
,
and
without
which
one
thread
in
the
web
I
have
spun
would
have
a
ravelled
end
.
   
<EOS>
I
had
advanced
in
fame
and
fortune
,
my
domestic
joy
was
perfect
,
I
had
been
married
ten
happy
years
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
and
I
were
sitting
by
the
fire
,
in
our
house
in
London
,
one
night
in
spring
,
and
three
of
our
children
were
playing
in
the
room
,
when
I
was
told
that
a
stranger
wished
to
see
me
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
been
asked
if
he
came
on
business
,
and
had
answered
No
<EOS>
;
he
had
come
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
me
,
and
had
come
a
long
way
.
<EOS>
He
was
an
old
man
,
my
servant
said
,
and
looked
like
a
farmer
.
   
<EOS>
As
this
sounded
mysterious
to
the
children
,
and
moreover
was
like
the
beginning
of
a
favourite
story
Agnes
used
to
tell
them
,
introductory
to
the
arrival
of
a
wicked
old
Fairy
in
a
cloak
who
hated
everybody
,
it
produced
some
commotion
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
our
boys
laid
his
head
in
his
mother
's
lap
to
be
out
of
harm
's
way
,
and
little
Agnes
(
our
eldest
child
)
left
her
doll
in
a
chair
to
represent
her
,
and
thrust
out
her
little
heap
of
golden
curls
from
between
the
window
-
curtains
,
to
see
what
happened
next
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
him
come
in
here
!
"
said
I.
   
There
soon
appeared
,
pausing
in
the
dark
doorway
as
he
entered
,
a
hale
,
grey
-
haired
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Agnes
,
attracted
by
his
looks
,
had
run
to
bring
him
in
,
and
I
had
not
yet
clearly
seen
his
face
,
when
my
wife
,
starting
up
,
cried
out
to
me
,
in
a
pleased
and
agitated
voice
,
that
it
was
Mr
Peggotty
!
   
<EOS>
It
WAS
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
An
old
man
now
,
<EOS>
but
in
a
ruddy
,
hearty
,
strong
old
age
.
 
<EOS>
When
our
first
emotion
was
over
,
and
he
sat
before
the
fire
with
the
children
on
his
knees
,
and
the
blaze
shining
on
his
face
,
he
looked
,
to
me
,
as
vigorous
and
robust
,
withal
as
handsome
,
<EOS>
an
old
man
,
as
ever
I
had
seen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
old
name
in
the
old
tone
fell
so
naturally
on
my
ear
!
"
<EOS>
Mas'r
Davy
,
'
tis
a
joyful
hour
as
I
see
you
,
once
more
,
'
long
with
your
own
trew
wife
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
joyful
hour
indeed
,
old
friend
!
<EOS>
"
cried
I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
these
heer
pretty
ones
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
look
at
these
heer
flowers
!
<EOS>
Why
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
you
was
but
the
heighth
of
the
littlest
of
these
,
when
I
first
see
you
!
<EOS>
When
Em'ly
warn't
<EOS>
no
bigger
,
and
our
poor
lad
were
BUT
a
lad
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Time
has
changed
me
more
than
it
has
changed
you
since
then
,
"
said
I.
 
"
<EOS>
But
let
these
dear
rogues
go
to
bed
;
and
as
no
house
in
England
<EOS>
but
this
must
hold
you
,
tell
me
where
to
send
for
your
luggage
<EOS>
(
is
the
old
black
bag
among
it
,
that
went
so
far
,
I
wonder
!
)
,
and
then
,
over
a
glass
of
Yarmouth
grog
,
we
will
have
the
tidings
of
ten
years
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
alone
?
"
asked
Agnes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
,
"
he
said
,
kissing
her
hand
,
"
quite
alone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
sat
him
between
us
,
not
knowing
how
to
give
him
welcome
enough
;
and
as
I
began
to
listen
to
his
old
familiar
voice
,
I
could
have
fancied
he
was
still
pursuing
his
long
journey
in
search
of
his
darling
niece
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
mort
of
water
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
fur
to
come
across
,
and
<EOS>
on'y
stay
a
matter
of
fower
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
But
water
(
'
specially
when
'
tis
salt
)
comes
nat'ral
to
me
;
and
friends
is
dear
,
and
I
am
heer
.
 
<EOS>
---
Which
is
verse
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
surprised
to
find
it
out
,
"
though
I
had
n't
such
intentions
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
back
those
many
thousand
miles
,
so
soon
?
"
asked
Agnes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
,
"
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
giv
the
promise
to
Em'ly
,
afore
<EOS>
I
come
away
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
,
I
doen't
grow
younger
as
the
years
comes
round
,
and
if
I
had
n't
sailed
as
'
twas
,
most
like
I
should
n't
never
have
done
'
<EOS>
t.
 
<EOS>
And
it
's
allus
<EOS>
been
on
my
mind
,
as
I
must
come
and
see
Mas'r
Davy
and
your
own
sweet
blooming
self
,
in
your
wedded
happiness
,
<EOS>
afore
I
got
to
be
too
old
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
looked
at
us
,
as
if
he
could
never
feast
his
eyes
on
us
sufficiently
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
laughingly
put
back
some
scattered
locks
of
his
grey
hair
,
that
he
might
see
us
better
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
now
tell
us
,
"
said
I
,
"
everything
relating
to
your
fortunes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Our
fortuns
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
he
rejoined
,
"
is
soon
told

<EOS>
We
have
n't
fared
nohows
,
but
fared
to
thrive

<EOS>
We
've
allus
thrived
.
 
<EOS>
We
've
worked
as
we
ought
to
'
t
,
and
maybe
we
lived
a
leetle
hard
at
first
or
so
,
but
we
have
allus
thrived
.
 
<EOS>
What
with
sheep
-
farming
,
and
what
with
stock
-
farming
,
and
what
with
one
thing

what
with
t'other

we

well
to

as
well
could
be

<EOS>
Theer
's
been
kiender
a
blessing
fell
upon

"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
reverentially
inclining
his
head
,
"
and
we
've
done

but
prosper

That
is

in

"
   
<EOS>
"
And
Emily

said
Agnes
and
I
,
both
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
Em'ly
,
"
said
he
,
"
arter
you
left
her

I
never

prayers

night

<EOS>
t'other
side
the
canvas
screen

when
we
was
settled
in

Bush

what
I
heerd
your

arter
<EOS>
she

me
lost
sight
of
Mas'r

theer
shining
sundown

low

what
Mas'r
Davy
kep
from

so
kind

thowtful
,

tis
my
opinion
she
'd
have
drooped
away

<EOS>
But
theer
was
some
poor
folks
aboard
as
had
illness
among
'em
,

she
took
care
of
them
;
and
theer
was
the
children
in
our
company
,
and
she
took
care
of
them
;
and
so
she
got
to
be
busy
,
and
to
be
doing
good
,
and
that
helped
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
did
she
first
hear
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
kep
it
from
her
arter
<EOS>
I
heerd
on
'
t
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
going
on
nigh
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
We
was
living
then
in
a
solitary
place
,
but
among
the
beautifullest
trees
,
and
with
the
roses
a
-
covering
our
Beein
to
the
roof
.
 
<EOS>
Theer
come
along
one
day
,
when
I
was
out
a
-
working
on
the
land
,
a
traveller
from
our
own
Norfolk
or
Suffolk
in
England
(
I
doen't
rightly
mind
which
)
,
and
of
course
we
took
him
in
,
and
giv
him
to
eat
and
drink
,
and
made
him
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
do
that
,
all
the
colony
over
.
 
<EOS>
He
'd
got
an
old
newspaper
with
him
,
and
some
other
account
in
print
of
the
storm
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
how
she
know'd
it
.
<EOS>
When
I
came
home
at
night
,
I
found
she
know'd
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
dropped
his
voice
as
he
said
these
words
,
and
the
gravity
<EOS>
I
so
well
remembered
overspread
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
it
change
her
much
?
<EOS>
"
we
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
for
a
good
long
time
,
"
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
;
"
if
not
to
this
present
hour
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
think
the
solitoode
done
her
good
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
had
a
deal
to
mind
in
the
way
of
poultry
and
the
like
,
and
minded
of
it
,
and
come
through
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
,
"
he
said
thoughtfully
,
"
if
you
could
see
my
Em'ly
now

Mas'r
Davy

whether
you
'd
know
her

<EOS>
"
Is
she
so
altered

I
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
doen't
know

<EOS>
I
see
her
ev'ry
day

and
doen't
know

<EOS>
But
,
odd
-
times
,
I
have
thowt
so
.
 
<EOS>
A
slight
figure
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
looking
at
the
fire
,
"
kiender
worn
;
soft
,
sorrowful
,
blue
eyes
;
a
delicate
face
;
a
pritty
head
,
leaning
a
little
down
;
a
quiet
voice
and
way
---
timid
a'most
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
Em'ly
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
silently
observed
him
as
he
sat
,
still
looking
at
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
Some
thinks
,

he
said
,
"
as
her
affection
was
ill
-
bestowed
;
some
,
as
her
marriage
was
broken
off
by
death
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
knows
how
'

<EOS>
She
might
have
married
well
,
a
mort
of
times

uncle

she
says
to
me
,
"
that

gone

<EOS>
Cheerful
along
with
me
;
retired
when
others
is
by
;
fond
of
going
any
distance
fur
to
teach
a
child

fur

tend

fur

fondly

<EOS>
That

"
   
<EOS>
He
drew
his
hand
across
his
face
,
and
with
a
half
-
suppressed
sigh
looked
up
from
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Martha
with
you
yet
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Martha
,
"
he
replied
,
"
got
married
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
in
the
second

<EOS>
A
young

,
a

come
by

on

with

then

<EOS>
She
spoke
to
me
fur
to
tell
him
her

<EOS>
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
They

their
own

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Gummidge
?
<EOS>
"
I
suggested
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
pleasant
key
to
touch
,
for
Mr
Peggotty
suddenly
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
,
and
rubbed
his
hands
up
and
down
his
legs
,
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
do
when
he
enjoyed
himself
in
the
long
-
shipwrecked
boat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
believe
it
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
someun
even
made
offer
fur
to
marry
her
!
<EOS>
If
a
ship
's
cook
that
was
turning

did

I
'm
Gormed

and
I
ca
n't
say
no
fairer
than
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
never
saw
Agnes
laugh
so
.
 
<EOS>
This
sudden
ecstasy
on
the
part
of
Mr
Peggotty
was
so
delightful
to
her
,
that
she
could
not
leave
off
laughing
;
and
the
more
she
laughed
the
more
she
made
me
laugh
,
and
the
greater
Mr
Peggotty
's
ecstasy
became
,
and
the
more
he
rubbed
his
legs
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
Mrs
Gummidge
say
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
when
I
was
grave
enough
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
believe
me
,
"
returned
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
Missis
Gummidge
,
'
stead
of
saying
"

till
he
sung
out
fur

I
went
in

reskied
of
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
burst
into
a
great
roar
of
laughter
,
and
Agnes
and
I
both
kept
him
company
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
say
this
,
for
the
good
creetur
,
"
he
resumed
,
wiping
his
face
,
when
we
were
quite
exhausted
;
"
she
has
been
all
she
said
she
'd
be
to
us

more
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
the

the

the
honestest

helping

Mas'r
Davy

as
ever
draw'd

the
breath

<EOS>
I
have
never
know'd
her
to
be
lone
and
lorn
,
for
a
single
minute
,
not
even
when
the
colony
was
all
afore
us
,
<EOS>
and
we
was
new
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
thinking
of
the
old
'
un
is
a
thing
she
never
done
,
I
do
assure
you
,
since
she
left
England
!

<EOS>
"
Now
,
last
,
not
least
,
Mr
Micawber
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
paid
off
every
obligation
he
incurred
here
---
even
to
Traddles
's
bill
,
you
remember
my
dear
Agnes

and
therefore
we
may
take
it
for
granted
that
he
is
doing
well
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
is
the
latest
news
of
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Peggotty
,
with
a
smile
,
put
his
hand
in
his
breast
-
pocket
,
and
produced
a
flat
-
folded
,
paper
parcel
,
from
which
he
took
out
,
with
much
care
,
a
little
odd
-
looking
newspaper
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
to
understan
'
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
"
said
he
,
"
as
we
have
left
the
Bush
now
,
being
so
well
to
do
;
and
have
gone
right
away
round
to
Port
Middlebay
Harbour
,
wheer
theer
's
<EOS>
what
we
call
a
town
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Micawber
was
in
the
Bush
near
you
?
"
said
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
,
yes
,
"
said
Mr
Peggotty
,
"
and
turned
to
with
a
will
.
<EOS>
I
never
wish
to
meet
a
better
gen'l'man
for
turning
to
with
a
will
.
<EOS>
I
've
seen
that
theer
bald
head
of
his
a
perspiring
in
the
sun
,
Mas'r
Davy
,
till
I
a'most
thowt
it
would
have
melted
away
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
he
's
a
Magistrate
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
Magistrate
,
eh
?
"
said
I.
   
Mr
Peggotty
pointed
to
a
certain
paragraph
in
the
newspaper
,
where
I
read
aloud
as
follows
,
from
the
Port
Middlebay
Times
:
   
<EOS>
"
The
public
dinner
to
our
distinguished
fellow
-
colonist
and
townsman
,
WILKINS
MICAWBER
,
ESQUIRE
,
Port
Middlebay
District
Magistrate
,
came
off
yesterday
in
the
large
room
of
the
Hotel
,
which
was
crowded
to
suffocation
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
estimated
that
not
fewer
than
forty
-
seven
persons
must
have
been
accommodated
with
dinner
at
one
time
,
exclusive
of
the
company
in
the
passage
and
on
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
The
beauty
,
fashion
,
and
exclusiveness
of
Port
Middlebay
,
flocked
to
do
honour
to
one
so
deservedly
esteemed
,
so
highly
talented
,
and
so
widely
popular
.
 
<EOS>
Doctor
Mell
(
of
Colonial
Salem
-
House
Grammar
School
,
Port
Middlebay
)
presided
,
and
on
his
right
sat
the
distinguished
guest
.
 
<EOS>
After
the
removal
of
the
cloth
,
and
the
singing
of
Non
Nobis
(
beautifully
executed
,
and
in
which
we
were
at
no
loss
to
distinguish
the
bell
-
like
notes
of
that
gifted
amateur
,
WILKINS
MICAWBER
,
ESQUIRE
,
JUNIOR
)
,
the
usual
loyal
and
patriotic
toasts
were
severally
given
and
rapturously
received
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Mell
,
in
a
speech
replete
with
feeling
,
then
proposed
"
Our
distinguished
Guest
,
the
ornament
of
our
town
.
 
<EOS>
May
he
never
leave
us
but
to
better
himself
,
and
may
his
success
among
us
be
such
as
to
render
his
bettering
himself
impossible
!
"
<EOS>
The
cheering
with
which
the
toast
was
received
defies
description
.
 
<EOS>
Again
and
again
it
rose
and
fell
,
like
the
waves
of
ocean
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
all
was
hushed
,
and
WILKINS
MICAWBER
,
ESQUIRE
,
presented
himself
to
return
thanks
.
 
<EOS>
Far
be
it
from
us
,
in
the
present
comparatively
imperfect
state
of
the
resources
of
our
establishment
,
to
endeavour
to
follow
our
distinguished
townsman
through
the
smoothly
-
flowing
periods
of
his
polished
and
highly
-
ornate
address
!
<EOS>
Suffice
it
to
observe
,
that
it
was
a
masterpiece
of
eloquence
;
and
that
those
passages
in
which
he
more
particularly
traced
his
own
successful
career
to
its
source
,
and
warned
the
younger
portion
of
his
auditory
from
the
shoals
of
ever
incurring
pecuniary
liabilities
which
they
were
unable
to
liquidate
,
brought
a
tear
into
the
manliest
eye
present
.
<EOS>
The
remaining
toasts
were
DOCTOR
MELL
;
Mrs
MICAWBER
(
who
gracefully
bowed
her
acknowledgements
from
the
side
-
door
,
where
a
galaxy
of
beauty
was
elevated
on
chairs
,
at
once
to
witness

the

Mrs

;
Mrs

WILKINS

who
convulsed
the
assembly
by
humorously
remarking
that
he
found
himself
unable
to
return
thanks
in
a
speech
,
but
would
do
so
,
with
their
permission
,
in
a
song

At
the
conclusion
of
the
proceedings
the
tables
were
cleared
as

magic
for
dancing

<EOS>
Among
the
votaries

who
disported
themselves
until

warning
for
departure

Wilkins

,
Esquire

the
lovely
and
accomplished
Miss

were
particularly
remarkable

<EOS>
I
was
looking
back
to
the
name
of
Doctor
Mell
,
pleased
to
have
discovered
,
in
these
happier
circumstances
,
Mr
Mell
,
formerly
poor
pinched
usher
to
my
Middlesex
magistrate
,
when
Mr
Peggotty
pointing
to
another
part
of
the
paper
,
my
eyes
rested
on
my
own
name
,
and
I
read
thus

But

my

though
estranged

had
no

from

personal

<EOS>
I
found
,
on
glancing
at
the
remaining
contents
of
the
newspaper
,
that
Mr
Micawber
was
a
diligent
and
esteemed
correspondent
of
that
journal
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
another
letter
from
him
in
the
same
paper
,
touching
a
bridge
;
there
was
an
advertisement
of
a
collection
of
similar
letters
by
him
,
to
be
shortly
republished
,
in
a
neat
volume
,
"
with
considerable
additions
"
;
and
,
unless
I
am
very
much
mistaken
,
the
Leading
Article
was
his
also
.
   
<EOS>
We
talked
much
of
Mr
Micawber
,
on
many
other
evenings
while
Mr
Peggotty
remained
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
lived
with
us
during
the
whole
term
of
his
stay
,
---
which
,
I
think
,
was
something
less
than
a
month
,
---
and
his
sister
and
my
aunt
came
to
London
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
Agnes
and
I
parted
from
him
aboard
-
ship
,
when
he
sailed
;
and
we
shall
never
part
from
him
more
,
on
earth
.
   
<EOS>
But
before
he
left
,
he
went
with
me
to
Yarmouth
,
to
see
a
little
tablet
I
had
put
up
in
the
churchyard
to
the
memory
of
Ham
.
 
<EOS>
While
I
was
copying
the
plain
inscription
for
him
at
his
request
,
I
saw
him
stoop
,
and
gather
a
tuft
of
grass
from
the
grave
and
a
little
earth
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
Em'ly

he
said
,
as
he
put
it
in
his
breast

<EOS>
A
last
retrospect
 
<EOS>
And
now
my
written
story
ends
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
back
,
once
more
---
for
the
last
time
---
before
I
close
these
leaves
.
   
<EOS>
I
see
myself
,
with
Agnes
at
my
side
,
journeying
along
the
road
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
our
children
and
our
friends
around
us
;
and
I
hear
the
roar
of
many
voices
,
not
indifferent
to
me
as
I
travel
on
.
   
<EOS>
What
faces
are
the
most
distinct
to
me
in
the
fleeting
crowd
?
 
<EOS>
Lo
,
these
;
all
turning
to
me
as
I
ask
my
thoughts
the
question
!
   
<EOS>
Here
is
my
aunt
,
in
stronger
spectacles
,
an
old
woman
of
four
-
score
years
and
more
,
but
upright
yet
,
and
a
steady
walker
of
six
miles
at
a
stretch
in
winter
weather
.
   
<EOS>
Always
with
her
,
here
comes
Peggotty
,
my
good
old
nurse
,
likewise
in
spectacles
,
accustomed
to
do
needle
-
work
at
night
very
close
to
the
lamp
,
but
never
sitting
down
to
it
without
a
bit
of
wax
candle
,
a
yard
-
measure
in
a
little
house
,
and
a
work

box
with
a
picture
of
St
Paul
's
upon
the

<EOS>
The
cheeks
and
arms
of
Peggotty
,
so
hard
and
red
in
my
childish
days
,
when
I
wondered
why
the
birds
did
n't
peck
her
in
preference
to
apples
,
are
shrivelled
now
;
and
her
eyes
,
that
used
to
darken
their
whole
neighbourhood
in
her
face
,
are
fainter
(
though
they
glitter
still
)
;
but
her
rough
forefinger
,
which
I
once
associated
with
a
pocket
nutmeg
-
grater
,
is
just
the
same
,
and
when
I
see
my
least
child
catching
at
it
as
it
totters
from
my
aunt
to
her
,
I
think
of
our
little
parlour
at
home
,
when
I
could
scarcely
walk
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
's
old
disappointment
is
set
right
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
godmother
to
a
real
living
Betsey
Trotwood
;
and
Dora
(
the
next
in
order
)
says
she
spoils
her
.
   
<EOS>
There
is
something
bulky
in
Peggotty
's
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
nothing
smaller
than
the
Crocodile
Book
,
which
is
in
rather
a
dilapidated
condition
by
this
time
,
with
divers
of
the
leaves
torn
and
stitched
across
,
but
which
Peggotty
exhibits
to
the
children
as
a
precious
relic
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
it
very
curious
to
see
my
own
infant
face
,
looking
up
at
me
from
the
Crocodile
stories
;
and
to
be
reminded
by
it
of
my
old
acquaintance
Brooks
of
Sheffield
.
   
<EOS>
Among
my
boys
,
this
summer
holiday
time
,
I
see
an
old
man
making
giant
kites
,
and
gazing
at
them
in
the
air
,
with
a
delight
for
which
there
are
no
words
.
 
<EOS>
He
greets
me
rapturously
,
and
whispers
,
with
many
nods
and
winks
,
"
Trotwood
,
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
I
shall
finish
the
Memorial
when
I
have
nothing
else
to
do
,
and
that
your
aunt
's
the
most
extraordinary
woman
in
the
world
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
Who
is
this
bent
lady
,
supporting
herself
by
a
stick
,
and
showing
me
a
countenance
in
which
there
are
some
traces
of
old
pride
and
beauty
,
feebly
contending
with
a
querulous
,
imbecile
,
fretful
wandering
of
the
mind
?
 
<EOS>
She
is
in
a
garden
;
and
near
her
stands
a
sharp
,
dark
,
withered
woman
,
with
a
white
scar
on
her
lip
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
hear
what
they
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rosa
,
I
have
forgotten
this
gentleman
's
name
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
bends
over
her
,
and
calls
to
her
,
"
Mr
Copperfield
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
see
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
to
observe
you
<EOS>
are
in
mourning
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Time
will
be
good
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
impatient
attendant
scolds
her
,
tells
her
I
am
not
in
mourning
,
bids
her
look
again
,
tries
to
rouse
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
my
son
,
sir
,
"
says
the
elder
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
reconciled
?
"
   
<EOS>
Looking
fixedly
at
me
,
she
puts
her
hand
to
her
forehead
,
and
moans
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
she
cries
,
in
a
terrible
voice
,
"
Rosa
,
come
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
dead
!
"
<EOS>
Rosa
kneeling
at
her
feet
,
by
turns
caresses
her
,
and
quarrels
with
her
;
now
fiercely
telling
her
,
"
I
loved
him
better
than
you
ever
did
!
"
---
now
soothing
her
to
sleep
on
her
breast
,
like
a
sick
child
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
I
leave
them
;
thus
I
always
find
them
;
thus
they
wear
their
time
away
,
from
year
to
year
.
   
<EOS>
What
ship
comes
sailing
home
from
India
,
and
what
English
lady
is
this
,
married
to
a
growling
old
Scotch
Croesus
with
great
flaps
of
ears
?
 
<EOS>
Can
this
be
Julia
Mills
?
   
<EOS>
Indeed
it
is
Julia
Mills
,
peevish
and
fine
,
with
a
black
man
to
carry
cards
and
letters
to
her
on
a
golden
salver
,
and
a
copper
-
coloured
woman
in
linen
,
with
a
bright
handkerchief
round
her
head
,
to
serve
her
Tiffin
in
her
dressing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
But
Julia
keeps
no
diary
in
these
days
;
never
sings
Affection
's
Dirge
;
eternally
quarrels
with
the
old
Scotch
Croesus
,
who
is
a
sort
of
yellow
bear
with
a
tanned
hide
.
 
<EOS>
Julia
is
steeped
in
money
to
the
throat
,
and
talks
and
thinks
of
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
I
liked
her
better
in
the
Desert
of
Sahara
.
   
<EOS>
Or
perhaps
this
IS
the
Desert
of
Sahara
!
<EOS>
For
,
though
Julia
has
a
stately
house
,
and
mighty
company
,
and
sumptuous
dinners
every
day
,
I
see
no
green
growth
near
her
;
nothing
that
can
ever
come
to
fruit
or
flower
.
 
<EOS>
What
Julia
calls
"
society
"
,
I
see
;
among
it
<EOS>
Mr
Jack
Maldon
,
from
his
Patent
Place
,
sneering
at
the
hand
that
gave
it
him
,
and
speaking
to
me
of
the
Doctor
as
"
so
charmingly
antique
"
.
<EOS>
But
when
society
is
the
name
for
such
hollow
gentlemen
and
ladies
,
Julia
,
and
when
its
breeding
is
professed
indifference
to
everything
that
can
advance
or
can
retard
mankind
,
I
think
we
must
have
lost
ourselves
in
that
same
Desert
of
Sahara
,
and
had
better
find
the
way
out
.
   
<EOS>
And
lo
,
the
Doctor
,
always
our
good
friend
,
labouring
at
his
Dictionary
(
somewhere
about
the
letter
D^
)
,
and
happy
in
his
home
and
wife
.
 
<EOS>
Also
the
Old
Soldier
,
on
a
considerably
reduced
footing
,
and
by
no
means
so
influential
as
in
days
of
yore
!
   
<EOS>
Working
at
his
chambers
in
the
Temple
,
with
a
busy
aspect
,
and
his
hair
(
where
he
is
not
bald
)
made
more
rebellious
than
ever
by
the
constant
friction
of
his
lawyer's
-
wig
<EOS>
,
I
come
,
in
a
later
time
,
upon
my
dear
old
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
His
table
is
covered
with
thick
piles
of
papers
;
and
I
say
,
as
I
look
around
me
:
   
<EOS>
"
If
Sophy
were
your
clerk
,
now
,
Traddles
,
she
would
have
enough
to
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
say
that
,
my
dear
Copperfield
!
<EOS>
But
those
were
capital
days
,
too
,
in
Holborn
Court
!
<EOS>
Were
they
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
she
told
you
you
would
be
a
judge
?
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
the
town
talk
then
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
,
"
says
Traddles
,
"
if
I
ever
am
one
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
know
you
will
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
WHEN
I
am
one
,
I
shall
tell
the
story
,
as
I
said
I
would
.
"
   
<EOS>
We
walk
away
,
arm
in
arm
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
have
a
family
dinner
with
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
Sophy
's
birthday
;
and
,
on
our
road
,
Traddles
discourses
to
me
of
the
good
fortune
he
has
enjoyed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
really
have
been
able
,
my
dear
Copperfield
,
to
do
all
that
I
had
most
at
heart
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
the
Reverend
Horace
promoted
to
that
living
at
four
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
;
there
are
our
two
boys
receiving
the
very
best
education
,
and
distinguishing
themselves
as
steady
scholars
and
good
fellows
;
there
are
three
of
the
girls
married
very
comfortably
;
there
are
three
more
living
with
us
;
there
are
three
more
keeping
house
for
the
Reverend
Horace
since
Mrs
Crewler
's
decease
;
and
all
of
them
happy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Except
---
"
I
suggest
.
   
<EOS>
"
Except
the
Beauty
,
"
says
Traddles
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
unfortunate
that
she
should
marry
such
a
vagabond
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
certain
dash
and
glare
about
him
that
caught
her
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
now
we
have
got
her
safe
at
our
house
,
and
got
rid
of
him
,
we
must
cheer
her
up
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
Traddles
's
house
is
one
of
the
very
houses
---
or
it
easily
may
have
been
---
which
he
and
Sophy
used
to
parcel
out
,
in
their
evening
walks
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
large
house
;
but
Traddles
keeps
his
papers
in
his
dressing
-
room
and
his
boots
with
his
papers
;
and
he
and
Sophy
squeeze
themselves
into
upper
rooms
,
reserving
the
best
bedrooms
for
the
Beauty
and
the
girls
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
room
to
spare
in
the
house
;
for
more
of
"
the
girls
"
are
here
,
and
always
are
here
,
by
some
accident
or
other
,
than
I
know
how
to
count
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
when
we
go
in
,
is
a
crowd
of
them
,
running
down
to
the
door
,
and
handing
Traddles
about
to
be
kissed
,
until
he
is
out
of
breath
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
established
in
perpetuity
,
is
the
poor
Beauty
,
a
widow
with
a
little
girl
;
here
,
at
dinner
on
Sophy
's
birthday
,
are
the
three
married
girls
with
their
three
husbands
,
and
one
of
the
husband
's
brothers
,
and
another
husband
's
cousin
,
and
another
husband
's
sister
,
who
appears
to
me
to
be
engaged
to
the
cousin
.
 
<EOS>
Traddles
,
exactly
the
same
simple
,
unaffected
fellow
as
he
ever
was
,
sits
at
the
foot
of
the
large
table
like
a
Patriarch
;
and
Sophy
beams
upon
him
,
from
the
head
,
across
a
cheerful
space
that
is
certainly
not
glittering
with
Britannia
metal
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
,
as
I
close
my
task
,
subduing
my
desire
to
linger
yet
,
these
faces
fade
away
.
 
<EOS>
But
one
face
,
shining
on
me
like
a
Heavenly
light
by
which
I
see
all
other
objects
,
is
above
them
and
beyond
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
remains
.
   
<EOS>
I
turn
my
head
,
and
see
it
,
in
its
beautiful
serenity
,
beside
me
.
   
<EOS>
My
lamp
burns
low
,
and
I
have
written
far
into
the
night
;
but
the
dear
presence
,
without
which
I
were
nothing
,
bears
me
company
.
   
<EOS>
O
Agnes
,
O
my
soul
,
so
may
thy
face
be
by
me
when
I
close
my
life
indeed
;
<EOS>
so
may
I
,
when
realities
are
melting
from
me
,
like
the
shadows
which
I
now
dismiss
,
still
find
thee
near
me
,
pointing
upward
!
