I

it

an
observation

will
generally

there
are
certain

IllustrationWITHIN
a
sepulchral
vault
,
and
at
midnight
,
two
persons
were
seated
.
<EOS>
The
chamber
was
of
singular
construction
and
considerable
extent
.
<EOS>
The
roof
was
of
solid
stone
masonry
,
and
rose
in
a
wide
semicircular
arch
to
the
height
of
about
seventeen
feet
,
measured
from
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
to
the
ground
floor
,
while
the
sides
were
divided
by
slight
partition
-
walls
into
ranges
of
low
,
narrow
catacombs
.
<EOS>
The
entrance
to
each
cavity
was
surrounded
by
an
obtusely
-
pointed
arch
,
resting
upon
slender
granite
pillars
;
and
the
intervening
space
was
filled
up
with
a
variety
of
tablets
,
escutcheons
,
shields
,
and
inscriptions
,
recording
the
titles
and
heraldic
honors
of
the
departed
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
doors
to
the
niches
;
and
within
might
be
seen
piles
of
coffins
,
packed
one
upon
another
,
till
the
floor
groaned
with
the
weight
of
lead
.
<EOS>
Against
one
of
the
pillars
,
upon
a
hook
,
hung
a
rack
of
tattered
,
time
-
out
-
of
-
mind
hatchments
;
and
in
the
centre
of
the
tomb
might
be
seen
the
effigies
of
Sir
Ranulph
de
Rokewode
,
the
builder
of
the
mausoleum
,
and
the
founder
of
the
race
who
slept
within
its
walls
.
<EOS>
This
statue
,
wrought
in
black
marble
,
differed
from
most
monumental
carved
-
work
,
in
that
its
posture
was
erect
and
lifelike
.
<EOS>
Sir
Ranulph
was
represented
as
sheathed
in
a
complete
suit
of
mail
,
decorated
with
his
emblazoned
and
gilded
surcoat
,
his
arm
leaning
upon
the
pommel
of
a
weighty
curtal
-
axe
.
<EOS>
The
attitude
was
that
of
stern
repose
.
<EOS>
A
conically
-
formed
helmet
rested
upon
the
brow
;
the
beaver
was
raised
,
and
revealed
harsh
but
commanding
features
.
<EOS>
The
golden
spur
of
knighthood
was
fixed
upon
the
heel
;
and
,
at
the
feet
,
enshrined
in
a
costly
sarcophagus
of
marble
,
dug
from
the
same
quarry
as
the
statue
,
<EOS>
rested
the
mortal
remains
of
one
of
"
the
sternest
knights
to
his
mortal
foe
that
ever
put
speare
in
the
rest
.
"Streaming
<EOS>
in
a
wavering
line
upon
the
roof
,
the
sickly
flame
of
a
candle
partially
fell
upon
the
human
figures
before
alluded
to
,
throwing
them
into
darkest
relief
,
and
casting
their
opaque
and
fantastical
shadows
along
the
ground
.
<EOS>
An
old
coffin
upon
a
bier
,
we
have
said
,
served
the
mysterious
twain
for
a
seat
.
<EOS>
Between
them
stood
a
bottle
and
a
glass
,
evidences
that
whatever
might
be
the
ulterior
object
of
their
stealthy
communion
,
the
immediate
comfort
of
the
creature
had
not
been
altogether
overlooked
.
<EOS>
At
the
feet
of
one
of
the
personages
were
laid
a
mattock
,
a
horn
lantern
—
from
which
the
candle
had
been
removed
—
,
a
crowbar
,
and
a
bunch
of
keys
.
<EOS>
Near
to
these
implements
of
a
vocation
which
the
reader
will
readily
surmise
,
rested
a
strange
superannuated
terrier
with
a
wiry
back
and
frosted
muzzle
;
a
head
minus
an
ear
,
and
a
leg
wanting
a
paw
.
<EOS>
His
master
,
for
such
we
shall
suppose
him
,
was
an
old
man
with
a
lofty
forehead
,
covered
with
a
singularly
shaped
nightcap
,
and
clothed
,
as
to
his
lower
limbs
,
with
tight
,
ribbed
,
gray
worsted
hose
,
ascending
externally
,
after
a
bygone
fashion
,
considerably
above
the
knee
.
<EOS>
The
old
man
's
elbow
rested
upon
the
handle
of
his
spade
,
his
wrist
supported
his
chin
,
and
his
gray
glassy
eyes
,
glimmering
like
marsh
-
meteors
in
the
candle
-
light
,
were
fixed
upon
his
companion
with
a
glance
of
searching
scrutiny
.
<EOS>
The
object
of
his
investigation
,
a
much
more
youthful
and
interesting
person
,
seemed
lost
in
reverie
,
and
alike
insensible
to
time
,
place
,
and
the
object
of
the
meeting
.
<EOS>
With
both
hands
grasped
round
the
barrel
of
a
fowling
-
piece
,
and
his
face
leaning
upon
the
same
support
,
the
features
were
entirely
concealed
from
view
;
the
light
,
too
,
being
at
the
back
,
and
shedding
its
rays
over
,
rather
than
upon
his
person
,
aided
his
disguise
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
even
thus
imperfectly
defined
,
the
outline
of
the
head
,
and
the
proportions
of
the
figure
,
were
eminently
striking
and
symmetrical
.
<EOS>
Attired
in
a
rough
forester
's
costume
,
of
the
mode
of
1737
,
and
of
the
roughest
texture
and
rudest
make
,
his
wild
garb
would
have
determined
his
rank
as
sufficiently
humble
in
the
scale
of
society
,
had
not
a
certain
loftiness
of
manner
,
and
bold
,
though
reckless
deportment
,
argued
pretensions
on
the
part
of
the
wearer
to
a
more
elevated
station
in
life
,
and
contradicted
,
in
a
great
measure
,
the
impression
produced
by
the
homely
appearance
of
his
habiliments
.
<EOS>
A
cap
of
shaggy
brown
fur
,
fancifully
,
but
not
ungracefully
fashioned
,
covered
his
head
,
from
beneath
which
,
dropping
,
in
natural
clusters
over
his
neck
and
shoulders
,
a
cloud
of
raven
hair
escaped
.
<EOS>
Subsequently
,
when
his
face
was
more
fully
revealed
,
it
proved
to
be
that
of
a
young
man
,
of
dark
aspect
,
and
grave
,
melancholy
expression
of
countenance
,
approaching
even
to
the
stern
,
when
at
rest
;
though
sufficiently
animated
and
earnest
when
engaged
in
conversation
,
or
otherwise
excited
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
regular
,
delicately
formed
,
and
might
be
characterized
as
singularly
handsome
,
were
it
not
for
a
want
of
roundness
in
the
contour
of
the
face
which
gave
the
lineaments
a
thin
,
worn
look
,
totally
distinct
,
however
,
from
haggardness
or
emaciation
.
<EOS>
The
nose
was
delicate
and
fine
;
the
nostril
especially
so
;
the
upper
lip
was
short
,
curling
,
graceful
,
and
haughtily
expressive
.
<EOS>
As
to
complexion
,
his
skin
had
a
truly
Spanish
warmth
and
intensity
of
coloring
.
<EOS>
His
figure
,
when
raised
,
was
tall
and
masculine
,
and
though
slight
,
exhibited
great
personal
vigor
.
<EOS>
We
will
now
turn
to
his
companion
,
the
old
man
with
the
great
gray
glittering
eyes
.
<EOS>
Peter
Bradley
,
of
Rookwood
—
comitatû
Ebor
—
,
where
he
had
exercised
the
vocation
of
sexton
for
the
best
part
of
a
life
already
drawn
out
to
the
full
span
ordinarily
allotted
to
mortality
,
was
an
odd
caricature
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
His
figure
was
lean
,
and
almost
as
lank
as
a
skeleton
.
<EOS>
His
bald
head
reminded
one
of
a
bleached
skull
,
allowing
for
the
overhanging
and
hoary
brows
.
<EOS>
Deep
-
seated
,
and
sunken
within
their
sockets
,
his
gray
orbs
gleamed
with
intolerable
lustre
.
<EOS>
Few
could
endure
his
gaze
;
and
,
aware
of
his
power
,
Peter
seldom
failed
to
exercise
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
likewise
another
habit
,
which
,
as
it
savored
of
insanity
,
made
him
an
object
of
commiseration
with
some
,
while
it
rendered
him
yet
more
obnoxious
to
others
.
<EOS>
The
habit
we
allude
to
,
was
the
indulgence
of
wild
screaming
laughter
at
times
when
all
merriment
should
be
checked
;
and
when
the
exhibition
of
levity
must
proceed
from
utter
disregard
of
human
grief
and
suffering
,
or
from
mental
alienation
.
<EOS>
Wearied
with
the
prolonged
silence
,
Peter
at
length
condescended
to
speak
.
<EOS>
His
voice
was
harsh
and
grating
as
a
rusty
hinge
.
<EOS>
"Another
glass
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
pouring
out
a
modicum
of
the
pale
fluid
.
<EOS>
His
companion
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
"It
will
keep
out
the
cold
,
"
continued
the
sexton
,
pressing
the
liquid
upon
him
:
"
and
you
,
who
are
not
so
much
accustomed
as
I
am
to
the
damps
of
a
vault
,
may
suffer
from
them
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
"
added
he
,
sneeringly
,
"
it
will
give
you
courage
.
<EOS>
"His
<EOS>
companion
answered
not
.
<EOS>
But
the
flash
of
his
eye
resented
the
implied
reproach
.
<EOS>
"Nay
,
never
stare
at
me
so
hard
,
Luke
,
"
continued
the
sexton
;
"
I
doubt
neither
your
courage
nor
your
firmness
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
wo
n't
drink
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
Here
's
to
the
rest
eternal
of
Sir
Piers
Rookwood
!
<EOS>
You
'll
say
amen
to
that
pledge
,
or
you
are
neither
grandson
of
mine
,
nor
offspring
of
his
loins
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
should
I
reverence
his
memory
,
"
answered
Luke
,
bitterly
,
refusing
the
proffered
potion
,
"
who
showed
no
fatherly
love
for
me
?
<EOS>
He
disowned
me
in
life
:
in
death
I
disown
him
.
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
Rookwood
was
no
father
of
mine
.
<EOS>
""He
was
as
certainly
your
father
,
as
Susan
Bradley
,
your
mother
,
was
my
daughter
,
"
rejoined
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"And
,
surely
,
"
cried
Luke
,
impetuously
,
"
you
need
not
boast
of
the
connection
!
'
<EOS>
Tis
not
for
you
,
old
man
,
to
couple
their
names
together
—
to
exult
in
your
daughter
's
disgrace
and
your
own
dishonor
.
<EOS>
Shame
!
<EOS>
shame
!
<EOS>
Speak
not
of
them
in
the
same
breath
,
if
you
would
not
have
me
invoke
curses
on
the
dead
!
<EOS>
I
have
no
reverence
—
whatever
you
may
have
—
for
the
seducer
—
for
the
murderer
of
my
mother
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
choice
store
of
epithets
,
in
sooth
,
good
grandson
,
"
rejoined
Peter
,
with
a
chuckling
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
a
murderer!""Tush
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Luke
,
indignantly
,
"
affect
not
ignorance
.
<EOS>
You
have
better
knowledge
than
I
have
of
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
the
dark
tale
that
has
gone
abroad
respecting
my
mother
's
fate
;
and
unless
report
has
belied
you
foully
,
had
substantial
reasons
for
keeping
sealed
lips
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
But
to
change
this
painful
subject
,
"
added
he
,
with
a
sudden
alteration
of
manner
,
"
at
what
hour
did
Sir
Piers
Rookwood
die?""On
Thursday
last
,
in
the
night
-
time
.
<EOS>
The
exact
hour
I
know
not
,
"
replied
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"Of
<EOS>
what
ailment?""Neither
<EOS>
do
I
know
that
.
<EOS>
His
end
was
sudden
,
yet
not
without
a
warning
sign
.
<EOS>
""What
warning
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Luke
.
<EOS>
"Neither
more
nor
less
than
the
death
-
omen
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
You
look
astonished
.
<EOS>
Is
it
possible
<EOS>
you
have
never
heard
of
the
ominous
Lime
-
Tree
,
and
the
Fatal
Bough
?
<EOS>
Why
,
'
tis
a
common
tale
hereabouts
,
and
has
been
for
centuries
.
<EOS>
Any
old
crone
would
tell
it
you
.
<EOS>
Peradventure
,
you
haveseen
the
old
avenue
of
lime
-
trees
leading
to
the
hall
,
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
length
,
and
as
noble
a
row
of
timber
as
any
in
the
West
Riding
of
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
Well
,
there
is
one
tree
—
the
last
on
the
left
hand
before
you
come
to
the
clock
-
house
—
larger
than
all
the
rest
—
a
huge
piece
of
timber
,
with
broad
spreading
branches
,
and
of
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
girth
in
the
trunk
.
<EOS>
That
tree
is
,
in
some
mysterious
manner
,
connected
with
the
family
of
Rookwood
,
and
immediately
previous
to
the
death
of
one
of
that
line
,
a
branch
is
sure
to
be
shed
from
the
parent
stem
,
prognosticating
his
doom
.
<EOS>
But
you
shall
hear
the
legend
.
"
<EOS>
And
in
a
strange
sepulchral
tone
,
not
inappropriate
,
however
,
to
his
subject
,
Peter
chanted
the
following
ballad
:
THE
LEGEND
OF
THE
LIME
-
TREEAmid
<EOS>
the
grove
o'er
-
arched
above
with
lime
-
trees
old
and
tall
—
<EOS>
The
avenue
that
leads
unto
the
Rookwood
's
ancient
<EOS>
hall—,High
<EOS>
o'er
<EOS>
the
rest
its
towering
crest
one
tree
rears
to
the
sky
,
And
wide
out
-
flings
,
like
mighty
wings
,
its
arms
umbrageously
.
<EOS>
Seven
yards
its
base
would
scarce
embrace
—
<EOS>
a
goodly
tree
I
ween
,
With
silver
bark
,
and
foliage
dark
,
of
melancholy
green;And
mid
its
boughs
two
ravens
house
,
and
build
from
year
to
year
,
Their
black
brood
hatch
—
their
black
brood
watch
—
then
screaming
disappear
.
<EOS>
In
that
old
tree
when
playfully
the
summer
breezes
sigh
,
Its
leaves
are
stirred
,
and
there
is
heard
a
low
and
plaintive
cry;And
when
in
shrieks
the
storm
blast
speaks
its
reverend
boughs
among
,
Sad
wailing
moans
,
like
human
groans
,
the
concert
harsh
prolong
.
<EOS>
But
whether
gale
or
calm
prevail
,
or
threatening
cloud
hath
fled
,
By
hand
of
Fate
,
predestinate
,
a
limb
that
tree
will
shed;A
verdant
bough
—
untouched
,
I
trow
,
by
axe
or
tempest
's
breath
—
<EOS>
To
Rookwood
's
head
an
omen
dread
of
fast
-
approaching
death
.
<EOS>
Some
think
that
tree
instinct
must
be
with
preternatural
power
.
<EOS>
Like
'
larum
bell
Death
's
note
to
knell
at
Fate
's
appointed
hour;While
some
avow
that
on
its
bough
are
fearful
traces
seen
,
Red
as
the
stains
from
human
veins
,
commingling
with
the
green
.
<EOS>
Others
,
again
,
there
are
maintain
that
on
the
shattered
barkA
print
is
made
,
where
fiends
have
laid
their
scathing
talons
<EOS>
dark;That
,
ere
it
falls
<EOS>
,
the
raven
calls
thrice
from
that
wizard
bough;And
that
each
cry
doth
signify
what
space
the
Fates
allow
.
<EOS>
In
olden
days
,
the
legend
says
,
as
grim
Sir
Ranulph
view'dA
wretched
hag
<EOS>
her
footsteps
drag
beneath
his
lordly
wood
.
<EOS>
His
bloodhounds
twain
he
called
amain
,
and
straightway
gave
her
chase;Was
never
seen
in
forest
green
,
so
fierce
,
so
fleet
<EOS>
a
race!With
eyes
of
flame
to
Ranulph
came
each
red
and
ruthless
hound
,
While
mangled
,
torn
—
a
sight
forlorn!—the
hag
lay
on
the
ground;E'en
where
she
lay
was
turned
the
clay
,
and
limb
and
reeking
boneWithin
the
earth
,
with
ribald
mirth
,
by
Ranulph
grim
were
thrown
.
<EOS>
And
while
as
yet
the
soil
was
wet
with
that
poor
witch
's
gore
,
A
lime
-
tree
stake
did
Ranulph
take
,
and
pierced
her
bosom
's
core;And
,
strange
to
tell
,
what
next
befell!—that
branch
at
once
took
root
,
And
richly
fed
,
within
its
bed
,
strong
suckers
forth
did
shoot
.
<EOS>
From
year
to
year
fresh
boughs
appear
—
it
waxes
huge
in
size;And
,
with
wild
glee
,
this
prodigy
Sir
Ranulph
grim
espies
.
<EOS>
One
day
,
when
he
,
beneath
that
tree
,
reclined
in
joy
and
pride
,
A
branch
was
found
upon
the
ground
—
the
next
,
Sir
Ranulph
died!And
from
that
hour
a
fatal
power
has
ruled
that
Wizard
Tree
,
To
Ranulph
's
line
a
warning
sign
of
doom
and
destiny
:
For
when
a
bough
is
found
,
I
trow
,
beneath
its
shade
to
lie
,
Ere
suns
shall
rise
thrice
in
the
skies
a
Rookwood
sure
<EOS>
shall
die!"And
such
an
omen
preceded
Sir
Piers
's
demise
?
<EOS>
"
said
Luke
,
who
hadlistened
with
some
attention
to
his
grandsire
's
song
.
<EOS>
"Unquestionably
,
"
replied
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"
Not
longer
ago
than
Tuesday
morning
,
I
happened
to
be
sauntering
down
the
avenue
I
have
just
described
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
took
me
thither
at
that
early
hour
,
but
I
wandered
leisurely
on
till
I
came
nigh
the
Wizard
Lime
-
Tree
.
<EOS>
Great
Heaven
!
<EOS>
what
a
surprise
awaited
me
!
<EOS>
a
huge
branch
lay
right
across
the
path
.
<EOS>
It
had
evidently
just
fallen
,
for
the
leaves
were
green
and
unwithered
;
the
sap
still
oozed
from
the
splintered
wood
;
and
there
was
neither
trace
of
knife
nor
hatchet
on
the
bark
.
<EOS>
I
looked
up
among
the
boughs
to
mark
the
spot
from
whence
<EOS>
it
had
been
torn
by
the
hand
of
Fate
<EOS>
—
for
no
human
hand
had
done
it
—
and
saw
the
pair
of
ancestral
ravens
perched
amid
the
foliage
,
and
croaking
as
those
carrion
fowl
are
wo
nt
to
do
when
they
scent
a
carcass
afar
off
.
<EOS>
Just
then
a
livelier
sound
saluted
my
ears
.
<EOS>
The
cheering
cry
of
a
pack
of
hounds
resounded
from
the
courts
,
and
the
great
gates
being
thrown
open
,
out
issued
Sir
Piers
,
attended
by
a
troop
of
his
roystering
companions
,
all
on
horseback
,
and
all
making
the
welkin
ring
with
their
vociferations
.
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
laughed
as
loudly
as
the
rest
,
but
his
mirth
was
speedily
checked
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
had
his
horse
—
old
Rook
,
his
favorite
steed
,
who
never
swerved
at
stake
or
pale
before
—
set
eyes
upon
the
accursed
branch
,
than
he
started
as
if
the
fiend
stood
before
him
,
and
,
rearing
backwards
,
flung
his
rider
from
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
with
loud
screams
,
the
wizard
ravens
took
flight
.
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
was
somewhat
hurt
by
the
fall
,
but
he
was
more
frightened
than
hurt
;
and
though
he
tried
to
put
a
bold
face
on
the
matter
,
it
was
plain
that
his
efforts
to
recover
himself
were
fruitless
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Titus
Tyrconnel
and
that
wild
fellow
Jack
Palmer
—
who
has
lately
come
to
the
hall
,
and
of
whom
you
know
something
—
tried
to
rally
him
.
<EOS>
But
it
would
not
do
.
<EOS>
He
broke
up
the
day
's
sport
,
and
returned
dejectedly
to
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Before
departing
,
however
,
he
addressed
a
word
to
me
in
private
,
respecting
you
;
and
pointed
,
with
a
melancholy
shake
of
the
head
,
to
the
fatal
branch
.
'
<EOS>
It
is
my
death
-
warrant
,
'
said
he
,
gloomily
.
<EOS>
And
so
it
proved
;
two
days
afterwards
his
doom
was
accomplished
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
do
you
place
faith
in
this
idle
legend
?
"
asked
Luke
,
with
affected
indifference
,
although
it
was
evident
,
from
his
manner
,
that
he
himself
was
not
so
entirely
free
from
a
superstitious
feeling
of
credulity
as
he
would
have
it
appear
.
<EOS>
"Certes
,
"
replied
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"
I
were
more
difficult
to
be
convinced
than
the
unbelieving
disciple
else
.
<EOS>
Thrice
hath
it
occurred
to
my
own
knowledge
,
and
ever
with
the
same
result
:
<EOS>
first
,
with
Sir
Reginald
;
secondly
,
with
thy
own
mother
;
and
lastly
,
as
I
have
just
told
thee
,
with
Sir
Piers
.
<EOS>
""I
thought
you
said
,
even
now
,
that
this
death
omen
,
if
such
it
be
,
was
always
confined
to
the
immediate
family
of
Rookwood
,
and
not
to
mere
inmates
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
""To
<EOS>
the
heads
only
of
that
house
,
be
they
male
or
female
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
how
could
it
apply
to
my
mother
?
<EOS>
Was
she
of
that
house
?
<EOS>
Was
she
<EOS>
a
wife?""Who
shall
say
she
was
not
?
"
rejoined
the
sexton
.
"Who
<EOS>
shall
say
she
was
so
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Luke
,
repeating
the
words
with
indignant
<EOS>
emphasis—"who
will
avouch
that?"A
smile
,
cold
as
a
wintry
sunbeam
,
played
upon
the
sexton
's
rigid
lips
.
<EOS>
"I
will
bear
this
no
longer
,
"
cried
Luke
;
"
anger
me
not
,
or
look
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
have
you
anything
to
tell
me
respecting
her
?
<EOS>
if
not
,
let
me
begone
.
<EOS>
""I
have
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
be
hurried
by
a
boy
like
you
,
"
replied
Peter
,
doggedly
.
<EOS>
"
Go
,
if
you
will
,
and
take
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
My
lips
are
sealed
forever
,
and
I
have
much
to
say
—
much
that
it
behoves
you
to
know
.
<EOS>
""Be
brief
,
then
.
<EOS>
When
you
sought
me
out
this
morning
,
in
my
retreat
with
the
gipsy
gang
at
Davenham
Wood
,
you
bade
me
meet
you
in
the
porch
of
Rookwood
Church
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
I
was
true
to
my
appointment
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
will
keep
my
promise
,
"
replied
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"
Draw
closer
,
that
I
may
whisper
in
thine
ear
.
<EOS>
Of
every
Rookwood
who
lies
around
us
—
and
all
that
ever
bore
the
name
,
except
Sir
Piers
himself
—
who
lies
in
state
at
the
hall
—
,
are
here
—
not
one

<EOS>
what
I
say
—
not
one
male
branch
of
the
house
but
has
been
suspected——""Of
what?""Of
murder
!
"
<EOS>
returned
the
sexton
,
in
a
hissing
whisper
.
"Murder
!
"
echoed
Luke
,
recoiling
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
is
one
dark
stain
—
one
foul
blot
on
all
.
<EOS>
Blood
—
blood
hath
been
spilt
.
<EOS>
""By
all?""Ay
,
and
such
blood
!
<EOS>
theirs
was
no
common
crime
.
<EOS>
Even
murder
hath
its
degrees
.
<EOS>
Theirs
was
of
the
first
class
.
<EOS>
""Their
<EOS>
wives!—you
can
not
mean
that?""Ay
,
their
wives!—I
do

<EOS>
You
have
heard
it
,
then
?
<EOS>
Ha
!
ha
!
'
<EOS>
tis
a
trick
they
had
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
hear
the
old
saying?No
mate
ever
brook
would
A
Rook
of
the
Rookwood!A
merry
saying
it
is
,
and
true
.
<EOS>
No
woman
ever
stood
in
a
Rookwood
's
way
<EOS>
but
she
was
speedily
removed
<EOS>
—
that
's
certain
.
<EOS>
They
had
all
,
save
poor
Sir
Piers
,
the
knack
of
stopping
a
troublesome
woman
's
tongue
,
and
practised
it
to
perfection
.
<EOS>
A
rare
art
,
eh?""What
have
the
misdeeds
of
his
ancestry
to
do
with
Sir
Piers
,
"
muttered
Luke
,
"
much
less
with
my
mother?""Everything
.
<EOS>
If
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
his
wife
—
and
she
is
a
match
for
the
devil
himself
—
,
the
mistress
might
be
more
readily
set
aside
.
<EOS>
""Have
<EOS>
you
absolute
knowledge
of
aught
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Luke
,
his
voice
tremulous
with
emotion
.
<EOS>
"Nay
,
I
but
hinted
.
<EOS>
""Such
<EOS>
hints
are
worse
than
open
speech
.
<EOS>
Let
me
know
the
worst
.
<EOS>
Did
he
kill
her
?
"
<EOS>
And
Luke
glared
at
the
sexton
as
if
he
would
have
penetrated
his
secret
soul
.
<EOS>
But
Peter
was
not
easily
fathomed
.
<EOS>
His
cold
,
bright
eye
returned
Luke
's
gaze
steadfastly
,
as
he
answered
,
composedly:"I
have
said
all
I
know
.
<EOS>
""But
not
all
you
think
.
<EOS>
""Thoughts
should
not
always
find
utterance
,
else
we
might
often
endanger
our
own
safety
,
and
that
of
others
.
<EOS>
""An
idle
subterfuge
—
<EOS>
and
,
from
you
,
worse
than
idle
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
an
answer
,
yea
or
nay
.
<EOS>
Was
it
poison
—
was
it
steel?""Enough
—
she
died
.
<EOS>
""No
,
it
is
not
enough
.
<EOS>
When
?
<EOS>
Where?""In
her
sleep
—
in
her
bed
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
,
that
was
natural
.
<EOS>
"A
wrinkling
smile
crossed
the
sexton
's
brow
.
<EOS>
"What
means
that
horrible
gleam
of
laughter
?
"
exclaimed
Luke
,
grasping
the
shoulder
of
the
man
of
graves
with
such
force
as
nearly
to
annihilate
him
.
"
<EOS>
Speak
,
or
I
will
strangle
you
.
<EOS>
She
died
,
you
say
,
in
her
sleep?""She
did
so
,
"
replied
the
sexton
,
shaking
off
Luke
's
hold
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
was
it
to
tell
me
that
I
had
a
mother
's
murder
to
avenge
,
that
you
brought
me
to
the
tomb
of
her
destroyer
—
when
he
is
beyond
the
reach
of
my
vengeance?"Luke
exhibited
so
much
frantic
violence
of
manner
and
gesture
,
that
the
sexton
entertained
some
little
apprehension
that
his
intellects
were
unsettled
by
the
shock
of
the
intelligence
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
therefore
,
in
what
he
intended
for
a
soothing
tone
that
he
attempted
to
solicit
his
grandson
's
attention
.
<EOS>
"I
will
hear
nothing
more
,
"
interrupted
Luke
,
and
the
vaulted
chamber
rang
with
his
passionate
lamentations
.
"
<EOS>
Am
I
the
sport
of
this
mocking
fiend
?
"
<EOS>
cried
he
,
"
to
whom
my
agony
is
derision
—
my
despair
a
source
of
enjoyment
—
beneath
whose
withering
glance
my
spirit
shrinks
—
who
,
with
half
-
expressed
insinuations
,
tortures
my
soul
,
awakening
fancies
that
goad
me
on
to
dark
and
desperate
deeds
?
<EOS>
Dead
mother
!
<EOS>
upon
thee
I
call
.
<EOS>
If
in
thy
grave
thou
canst
hear
the
cry
of
thy
most
wretched
son
,
yearning
to
avenge
thee
—
answer
me
,
if
thou
hast
the
power
.
<EOS>
Let
me
have
some
token
of
the
truth
or
falsity
of
these
wild
suppositions
,
that
I
may
wrestle
against
this
demon
.
<EOS>
But
no
,
"
added
he
,
in
accents
of
despair
,
"
<EOS>
no
ear
listens
to
me
,
save
his
to
whom
my
wretchedness
is
food
for
mockery
.
<EOS>
""Could
<EOS>
the
dead
hear
thee
,
thy
mother
might
do
so
,
"
returned
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"
She
lies
within
this
space
.
<EOS>
"Luke
staggered
back
,
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
shot
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
not
,
but
fell
with
a
violent
shock
against
a
pile
of
coffins
,
at
which
he
caught
for
support
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
have
I
done
?
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
recoiling
.
<EOS>
A
thundering
crash
resounded
through
the
vault
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
coffins
,
dislodged
from
its
position
by
his
fall
,
tumbled
to
the
ground
,
and
,
alighting
upon
its
side
,
split
asunder
.
<EOS>
"Great
<EOS>
Heavens
!
<EOS>
what
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Luke
,
as
a
dead
body
,
clothed
in
all
the
hideous
apparel
of
the
tomb
,
rolled
forth
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
"It
is
your
mother
's
corpse
,
"
answered
the
sexton
,
coldly
;
"
I
brought
you
hither
to
behold
it
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
anticipated
my
intentions
.
<EOS>
""This
my
mother
?
<EOS>
"
shrieked
Luke
,
dropping
upon
his
knees
by
the
body
,
and
seizing
one
of
its
chilly
hands
,
as
it
lay
upon
the
floor
,
with
the
face
upwards
.
<EOS>
The
sexton
took
the
candle
from
the
sconce
.
<EOS>
"Can
<EOS>
this
be
death
?
"
shouted
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Impossible
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
she
stirs
—
she
moves
.
<EOS>
The
light!—quick
.
<EOS>
I
see
her
stir
!
<EOS>
This
is
dreadful!""Do
not
deceive
yourself
,
"
said
the
sexton
,
in
a
tone
which
betrayed
more
emotion
than
was
his
wo
nt
.
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
the
bewilderment
of
fancy
.
<EOS>
She
will
never
stir
again
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
shaded
the
candle
with
his
hand
,
so
as
to
throw
the
light
full
upon
the
face
of
the
corpse
.
<EOS>
It
was
motionless
,
as
that
of
an
image
carved
in
stone
.
<EOS>
No
trace
of
corruption
was
visible
upon
the
rigid
,
yet
exquisite
tracery
of
its
features
.
<EOS>
A
profuse
cloud
of
raven
hair
,
escaped
from
its
swathements
in
the
fall
,
hung
like
a
dark
veil
over
the
bosom
and
person
of
the
dead
,
and
presented
a
startling
contrast
to
the
waxlike
hue
of
the
skin
and
the
pallid
cereclothes
.
<EOS>
Flesh
still
adhered
to
the
hand
,
though
it
mouldered
into
dust
within
the
gripe
of
Luke
,
as
he
pressed
the
fingers
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
The
shroud
was
disposed
like
night
-
gear
about
her
person
,
and
from
without
its
folds
a
few
withered
flowers
had
fallen
.
<EOS>
A
strong
aromatic
odor
,
of
a
pungent
nature
,
was
diffused
around
;
giving
evidence
that
the
art
by
which
the
ancient
Egyptians
endeavored
to
rescue
their
kindred
from
decomposition
had
been
resorted
to
,
to
preserve
the
fleeting
charms
of
the
unfortunate
Susan
Bradley
.
<EOS>
A
pause
of
awful
silence
succeeded
,
broken
only
by
the
convulsive
respiration
of
Luke
.
<EOS>
The
sexton
stood
by
,
apparently
an
indifferent
spectator
of
the
scene
of
horror
.
<EOS>
His
eye
wandered
from
the
dead
to
the
living
,
and
gleamed
with
a
peculiar
and
indefinable
expression
,
half
apathy
,
half
abstraction
.
<EOS>
For
one
single
instant
,
as
he
scrutinized
the
features
of
his
daughter
,
his
brow
,
contracted
by
anger
,
immediately
afterwards
was
elevated
in
scorn
.
<EOS>
But
otherwise
you
would
have
sought
in
vain
to
read
the
purport
of
that
cold
,
insensible
glance
,
which
dwelt
for
a
brief
space
on
the
face
of
the
mother
,
and
settled
eventually
upon
her
son
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
withered
flowers
attracted
his
attention
.
<EOS>
He
stooped
to
pick
up
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
"Faded
<EOS>
as
the
hand
that
gathered
ye
—
as
the
bosom
on
which
ye
were
strewn
!
"
he
murmured
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
sweet
smell
left
—
but
—
faugh
!
"
<EOS>
Holding
the
dry
leaves
to
the
flame
of
the
candle
,
they
were
instantly
ignited
,
and
the
momentary
brilliance
played
like
a
smile
upon
the
features
of
the
dead
.
<EOS>
Peter
observed
the
effect
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
was
thy
life
,
"
he
exclaimed
;
"
a
brief
,
bright
sparkle
,
followed
by
dark
,
utter
extinction!"Saying
which
,
he
flung
the
expiring
ashes
of
the
floweret
from
his
hand
.

<EOS>
THE
sexton
's
waning
candle
now
warned
him
of
the
progress
of
time
,
and
having
completed
his
arrangements
,
he
addressed
himself
to
Luke
,
intimating
his
intention
of
departing
.
<EOS>
But
receiving
no
answer
,
and
remarking
no
signs
of
life
about
his
grandson
,
he
began
to
be
apprehensive
that
he
had
fallen
into
a
swoon
.
<EOS>
Drawing
near
to
Luke
,
he
took
him
gently
by
the
arm
.
<EOS>
Thus
disturbed
,
Luke
groaned
aloud
.
<EOS>
"I
am
glad
to
find
you
can
breathe
,
if
it
be
only
after
that
melancholy
fashion
,
"
said
the
sexton
;
"
but
come
,
I
have
wasted
time
enough
already
.
<EOS>
You
must
indulge
your
grief
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
""Leave
<EOS>
me
,
"
sighed
Luke
.
<EOS>
"What
,
here
?
<EOS>
It
were
as
much
as
my
office
is
worth
.
<EOS>
You
can
return
some
other
night
.
<EOS>
But
go
you
must
,
now
—
at
least
,
if
you
take
on
thus
.
<EOS>
I
never
calculated
upon
a
scene
like
this
,
or
it
had
been
long
ere
<EOS>
I
brought
you
hither
.
<EOS>
So
come
away
;
yet
,
stay;—but
first
lend
me
a
hand
to
replace
the
body
in
the
coffin
.
<EOS>
""Touch
it
not
,
"
exclaimed
Luke
;
"
she
shall
not
rest
another
hour
within
these
accursed
walls
.
<EOS>
I
will
bear
her
hence
myself
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
sobbing
hysterically
,
he
relapsed
into
his
former
insensibility
.
<EOS>
"Poh
!
<EOS>
this
is
worse
than
midsummer
madness
,
"
said
Peter
;
"
the
lad
is
crazed
with
grief
,
and
all
about
a
mother
who
has
been
four
-
and
-
twenty
years
in
her
grave
.
<EOS>
I
will
e'en
put
her
out
of
the
way
myself
.
<EOS>
"Saying
<EOS>
which
,
he
proceeded
,
as
noiselessly
as
possible
,
to
raise
the
corpse
in
his
arms
,
and
deposited
it
softly
within
its
former
tenement
.
<EOS>
Carefully
as
he
executed
his
task
,
he
could
not
accomplish
it
without
occasioning
a
slight
accident
to
the
fragile
frame
.
<EOS>
Insensible
as
he
was
,
Luke
had
not
relinquished
the
hold
he
maintained
of
his
mother
's
hand
.
<EOS>
And
when
Peter
lifted
the
body
,
the
ligaments
connecting
the
hand
with
the
arm
were
suddenly
snapped
asunder
.
<EOS>
It
would
appear
afterwards
,
that
this
joint
had
been
tampered
with
,
and
partially
dislocated
.
<EOS>
Without
,
however
,
entering
into
further
particulars
in
this
place
,
it
may
be
sufficient
to
observe
that
the
hand
,
detached
from
the
socket
at
the
wrist
,
remained
within
the
gripe
of
Luke
;
while
,
ignorant
of
the
mischief
he
had
occasioned
,
the
sexton
continued
his
labors
unconsciously
,
until
the
noise
which
he
of
necessity
made
in
stamping
with
his
heel
upon
the
plank
,
recalled
his
grandson
to
sensibility
.
<EOS>
The
first
thing
that
the
latter
perceived
,
upon
collecting
his
faculties
,
were
the
skeleton
fingers
twined
within
his
own
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
have
you
done
with
the
body
?
<EOS>
Why
have
you
left
this
with
me
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
he
.
<EOS>
"It
was
not
my
intention
to
have
done
so
,
"
answered
the
sexton
,
suspending
his
occupation
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
made
fast
the
lid
,
but
it
is
easily
undone
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
restore
it
.
<EOS>
""Never
,
"
returned
Luke
,
staring
at
the
bony
fragment
.
<EOS>
"Pshaw
!
<EOS>
of
what
advantage
is
a
dead
hand
?
'
<EOS>
Tis
an
unlucky
keepsake
,
and
will
lead
to
mischief
.
<EOS>
The
only
use
I
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
being
turned
to
,
was
in
the
case
of
Bow
-
legged
Ben
,
who
was
hanged
in
irons
for
murder
,
on
Hardchase
Heath
,
on
the
York
Road
,
and
whose
hand
was
cut
off
at
the
wrist
the
first
night
to
make
a
Hand
of
Glory
,
or
Dead
Man
's
Candle
.
<EOS>
Hast
never
heard
what
the
old
song
says
?
<EOS>
"
And
without
awaiting
his
grandson
's
response
,
Peter
broke
into
the
following
wild
strain
:
THE
HAND
OF
GLORY[1]From
the
corse
that
hangs
on
the
roadside
tree
—
<EOS>
A
murderer
's
corse
<EOS>
it
needs
must
<EOS>
be—,Sever
<EOS>
the
right
hand
carefully:—Sever
the
hand
that
the
deed
hath
done
,
Ere
the
flesh
that
clings
to
the
bones
<EOS>
be
gone;In
<EOS>
its
dry
veins
must
blood
be
none
.
<EOS>
Those
ghastly
fingers
white
and
cold
<EOS>
,
Within
a
winding
-
sheet
enfold;Count
the
mystic
count
of
seven
<EOS>
:
Name
the
Governors
of
Heaven.[2]Then
in
earthen
vessel
place
them
,
And
with
dragon
-
wort
encase
them
,
Bleach
them
in
the
noonday
sun
,
Till
the
marrow
melt
and
run
,
Till
the
flesh
is
pale
and
wan
,
As
a
moon
-
ensilvered
cloud
,
As
an
unpolluted
shroud
.
<EOS>
Next
within
their
chill
embraceThe
<EOS>
dead
man
's
Awful
Candle
place;Of
murderer
's
fat
must
that
candle
be
—
<EOS>
You
may
scoop
it
beneath
the
roadside
tree—,Of
wax
,
and
of
Lapland
sisame
.
<EOS>
Its
wick
must
be
twisted
of
hair
of
the
dead
,
By
the
crow
and
her
brood
on
the
wild
waste
shed
.
<EOS>
Wherever
that
terrible
light
shall
burnVainly
the
sleeper
may
toss
and
turn;His
leaden
lids
shall
<EOS>
he
ne'er
uncloseSo
long
as

magical
taper
glows
.
<EOS>
Life
and
treasures
shall
<EOS>
he
commandWho
knoweth
the
charm
of
the
Glorious
Hand!But
of
black
cat
's
gall
<EOS>
let
him
aye
have
care
,
And
of
screech
-
owl
's
venomous
blood
beware!"Peace
!
<EOS>
"
thundered
Luke
,
extending
his
mother
's
hand
towards
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"
What
seest
thou?""I
see
something
shine
.
<EOS>
Hold
it
nigher
the
light
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
that
is
strange
,
truly
.
<EOS>
How
came
that
ring
there?""Ask
of
Sir
Piers
!
<EOS>
ask
of
her
husband
!
"
shouted
Luke
,
with
a
wild
burst
of
exulting
laughter
.
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
'
<EOS>
tis
a
wedding
-
ring
!
<EOS>
And
look
!
<EOS>
the
finger
is
bent
.
<EOS>
It
must
have
been
placed
upon
it
in
her
lifetime
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
deception
in
this
—
no
trickery
—
ha!""It
would
seem
not
;
the
sinew
must
have
been
contracted
in
life
.
<EOS>
The
tendons
are
pulled
down
so
tightly
,
that
the
ring
could
not
be
withdrawn
without
breaking
the
finger
.
<EOS>
""You
are
sure
that
coffin
contains
her
<EOS>
body?""As
<EOS>
sure
as
I
am
that
this
carcass
is
my
own
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
hand—'tis
hers
.
<EOS>
Can
any
doubt
exist?""Wherefore
should
it
?
<EOS>
It
was
broken
from
the
arm
by
accident
within
this
moment
.
<EOS>
I
noticed
not
the
occurrence
,
but
it
must
have
been
so
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
it
follows
that
she
was
wedded
,
and
I
am
not——""Illegitimate
.
<EOS>
For
your
own
sake
I
am
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
heart
will
burst
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
could
I
but
establish
the
fact
of
this
marriage
,
her
wrongs
would
be
indeed
avenged
.
<EOS>
""Listen
<EOS>
to
me
,
Luke
,
"
said
the
sexton
,
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
,
when
I
appointed
this
midnight
interview
,
I
had
a
secret
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
That
secret
is
now
revealed
—
that
secret
was
your
mother
's
marriage
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
it
was
known
to
you
during
her
lifetime?""It
was
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
sworn
to
secrecy
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
proofs
then?""I
have
nothing
beyond
Sir
Piers
's
word
—
and
he
is
silent
now
.
<EOS>
""By
<EOS>
whom
was
the
ceremony
performed?""By
a
Romish
priest
—
a
Jesuit
—
one
Father
Checkley
,
at
that
time
an
inmate
of
the
hall
;
for
Sir
Piers
,
though
he
afterwards
abjured
it
,
at
that
time
professed
the
Catholic
faith
,
and
this
Checkley
officiated
as
his
confessor
and
counsellor
;
as
the
partner
of
his
pleasures
,
and
the
prompter
of
his
iniquities
.
<EOS>
He
was
your
father
's
evil
genius
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
he
still
alive?""I
know
not
.
<EOS>
After
your
mother
's
death
he
left
the
hall
.
<EOS>
I
have
said
he
was
a
Jesuit
,
and
I
may
add
,
that
he
was
mixed
up
in
dark
political
intrigues
,
in
which
your
father
was
too
feeble
a
character
to
take
much
share
.
<EOS>
But
though
too
weak
to
guide
,
he
was
a
pliant
instrument
,
and
this
Checkley
knew
.
<EOS>
He
moulded
him
according
to
his
wishes
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
you
what
was
the
nature
of
their
plots
.
<EOS>
Suffice
it
,
they
were
such
as
,
if
discovered
,
would
have
involved
your
father
in
ruin
.
<EOS>
He
was
saved
,
however
,
by
his
wife
.
""And
<EOS>
her
reward
—
—
"
groaned
Luke
.
<EOS>
"Was
<EOS>
death
,
"
replied
Peter
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
What
Jesuit
ever
forgave
a
wrong
—
real
or
imaginary
?
<EOS>
Your
mother
,
I
ought
to
have
said
,
was
a
Protestant
.
<EOS>
Hence
there
was
a
difference
of
religious
opinion
—
the
worst
of
differences
that
can
exist
between
husband
and
wife—.
Checkley
vowed
her
destruction
,
and
he
kept
his
vow
.
<EOS>
He
was
enamored
of
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
But
while
he
burnt
with
adulterous
desire
,
he
was
consumed
by
fiercest
hate
—
contending
,
and
yet
strangely
-
reconcilable
passions
—
as
you
may
have
reason
,
hereafter
,
to
discover
.
<EOS>
""Go
on
,
"
said
Luke
,
grinding
his
teeth
.
<EOS>
"I
have
done
,
"
returned
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
From
that
hour
your
father
's
love
for
his
supposed
mistress
,
and
unacknowledged
wife
,
declined
;
and
with
his
waning
love
declined
her
health
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
waste
words
in
describing
the
catastrophe
that
awaited
her
union
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
enough
to
say
,
she
was
found
one
morning
a
corpse
within
her
bed
.
<EOS>
Whatever
suspicions
were
attached
to
Sir
Piers
were
quieted
by
Checkley
,
who
distributed
gold
,
largely
and
discreetly
.
<EOS>
The
body
was
embalmed
by
Barbara
Lovel
,
the
Gipsy
Queen
.
<EOS>
""My
foster
-
mother
!
"
exclaimed
Luke
,
in
a
tone
of
extreme
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"Ah
,
"
replied
Peter
,
"
from
her
you
may
learn
all
particulars
.
<EOS>
You
have
now
seen
what
remains
of
your
mother
.
<EOS>
You
are
in
possession
of
the
secret
of
your
birth
.
<EOS>
The
path
is
before
you
,
and
if
you
would
arrive
at
honor
you
must
pursue
it
steadily
,
turning
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
.
<EOS>
Opposition
you
will
meet
at
each
step
.
<EOS>
But
fresh
lights
may
be
thrown
upon
this
difficult
case
.
<EOS>
It
is
in
vain
to
hope
for
Checkley
's
evidence
,
even
should
the
caitiff
priest
be
living
.
<EOS>
He
is
himself
too
deeply
implicated
—
ha!"Peter
stopped
,
for
at
this
moment
the
flame
of
the
candle
suddenly
expired
,
and
the
speakers
were
left
in
total
darkness
.
<EOS>
Something
like
a
groan
followed
the
conclusion
of
the
sexton
's
discourse
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
that
it
proceeded
not
from
his
grandson
,
as
an
exclamation
burst
from
him
at
the
same
instant
.
<EOS>
Luke
stretched
out
his
arm
.
<EOS>
A
cold
hand
seemed
to
press
against
his
own
,
communicating
a
chill
like
death
to
his
frame
.
<EOS>
"Who
is
between
us
?
"
<EOS>
he
ejaculated
.
<EOS>
"The
devil
!
"
cried
the
sexton
,
leaping
from
the
coffin
-
lid
with
an
agility
that
did
him
honor
.
"
<EOS>
Is
aught
between
us?""I
will
discharge
my
gun
.
<EOS>
Its
flash
will
light
us
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
so
,
"
hastily
rejoined
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
But
not
in
this
direction
.
<EOS>
""Get
behind
me
,
"
cried
Luke
.
<EOS>
And
he
pulled
the
trigger
.
<EOS>
A
blaze
of
vivid
light
illumined
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
Still
nothing
was
visible
,
save
the
warrior
figure
,
which
was
seen
for
a
moment
,
and
then
vanished
like
a
ghost
.
<EOS>
The
buck
-
shot
rattled
against
the
further
end
of
the
vault
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
us
go
hence
,
"
ejaculated
the
sexton
,
who
had
rushed
to
the
door
,
and
thrown
it
wide
open
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mole
!
Mole
!
"
<EOS>
cried
he
,
and
the
dog
sprang
after
him
.
<EOS>
"I
could
have
sworn
I
felt
something
,
"
said
Luke
;
"
whence
issued
that
groan?""Ask
not
whence
,
"
replied
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Reach
me
my
mattock
,
and
spade
,
and
the
lantern
;
they
are
behind
you
.
<EOS>
And
stay
,
it
were
better
to
bring
away
the
bottle
.
<EOS>
""Take
them
,
and
leave
me
here
.
<EOS>
""Alone
<EOS>
in
the
vault?—no
,
no
,
Luke
,
I
have
not
told
you
half
<EOS>
I
know
concerning
that
mystic
statue
.
<EOS>
It
is
said
to
move
—
to
walk
—
to
raise
its
axe
—
be
warned
,
I
pray
.
<EOS>
""Leave
me
,
or
abide
<EOS>
,
if
you
will
,
my
coming
,
in
the
church
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
aught
that
may
be
revealed
to
my
ear
alone
,
I
will
not
shrink
from
it
,
though
the
dead
themselves
should
arise
to
proclaim
the
mystery
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
—
but
—
go
—
there
are
your
tools
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
shut
the
door
,
with
a
jar
that
shook
the
sexton
's
frame
.
<EOS>
Peter
,
after
some
muttered
murmurings
at
the
hardihood
and
madness
,
as
he
termed
it
,
of
his
grandson
,
disposed
his
lanky
limbs
to
repose
upon
a
cushioned
bench
without
the
communion
railing
.
<EOS>
As
the
pale
moonlight
fell
upon
his
gaunt
and
cadaverous
visage
,
he
looked
like
some
unholy
thing
suddenly
annihilated
by
the
presiding
influence
of
that
sacred
spot
.
<EOS>
Mole
crouched
himself
in
a
ring
at
his
master
's
feet
.
<EOS>
Peter
had
not
dozed
many
minutes
,
when
he
was
aroused
by
Luke
's
return
.
<EOS>
The
latter
was
very
pale
,
and
the
damp
stood
in
big
drops
upon
his
brow
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
you
made
fast
the
door
?
"
inquired
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"Here
is
the
key
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
have
you
seen
?
<EOS>
"
he
next
demanded
.
<EOS>
Luke
made
no
answer
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
,
the
church
clock
struck
two
,
breaking
the
stillness
with
an
iron
clang
.
<EOS>
Luke
raised
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
A
ray
of
moonlight
,
streaming
obliquely
through
the
painted
window
,
fell
upon
the
gilt
lettering
of
a
black
mural
entablature
.
<EOS>
The
lower
part
of
the
inscription
was
in
the
shade
,
but
the
emblazonment
,
and
the
words
—
Orate
<EOS>
pro
anima
Reginaldi
Rookwood
equitis
aurati
,
were
clear
and
distinct
.
<EOS>
Luke
trembled
,
he
knew
not
why
,
as
the
sexton
pointed
to
it
.
<EOS>
"You
have
heard
of
the
handwriting
upon
the
wall
,
"
said
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Look
there!—'His
kingdom
hath
been
taken
from
him
.
'
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
Of
all
thy
monster
race
—
of
all
the
race
of
Rookwood
I
should
say
—
no
demon
ever
stalked
the
earth
more
terrible
than
him
whose
tablet
you
now
behold
.
<EOS>
By
him
a
brother
was
betrayed
;
by
him
a
brother
's
wife
was
dishonored
.
<EOS>
Love
,
honor
,
friendship
,
were
with
him
as
words
.
<EOS>
He
regarded
no
ties
;
he
defied
and
set
at
naught
all
human
laws
and
obligations
—
and
yet
he
was
religious
,
or
esteemed
so
—
received
the
viaticum
,
and
died
full
of
years
and
honors
,
hugging
salvation
to
his
sinful
heart
.
<EOS>
And
after
death
he
has
yon
lying
epitaph
to
record
his
virtues
.
<EOS>
His
virtues
!
<EOS>
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
Ask
him
who
preaches
to
the
kneeling
throng
gathering
within
this
holy
place
what
shall
be
the
murderer
's
portion
—
and
he
will
answer
—
Death
!
<EOS>
And
yet
Sir
Reginald
was
long
-
lived
.
<EOS>
The
awful
question
,
'
Cain
,
where
is
thy
brother
?
'
<EOS>
broke
not
his
tranquil
slumbers
.
<EOS>
Luke
,
I
have
told
you
much
—
but
not
all
.
<EOS>
You
know
not
,
as
yet
—
nor
<EOS>
shall
you
know
your
destiny
;
but
you
shall
be
the
avenger
of
infamy
and
blood
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
sacred
charge
committed
to
my
keeping
,
which
,
hereafter
,
I
may
delegate
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
shall
be
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
,
but
the
conditions
must
be
mine
to
propose
.
<EOS>
""No
more
,
"
said
Luke
;
"
my
brain
reels
.
<EOS>
I
am
faint
.
<EOS>
Let
us
quit
this
place
,
and
get
into
the
fresh
air
.
"
<EOS>
And
striding
past
his
grandsire
he
traversed
the
aisles
with
hasty
steps
.
<EOS>
Peter
was
not
slow
to
follow
.
<EOS>
The
key
was
applied
,
and
they
emerged
into
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
The
grassy
mounds
were
bathed
in
the
moonbeams
,
and
the
two
yew
-
trees
,
throwing
their
black
jagged
shadows
over
the
grave
hills
,
looked
like
evil
spirits
brooding
over
the
repose
of
the
righteous
.
<EOS>
The
sexton
noticed
the
deathly
paleness
of
Luke
's
countenance
,
but
he
fancied
it
might
proceed
from
the
tinge
of
the
sallow
moonlight
.
<EOS>
"I
will
be
with
you
at
your
cottage
ere
daybreak
,
"
said
Luke
.
<EOS>
And
turning
an
angle
of
the
church
,
he
disappeared
from
view
.
<EOS>
"So
,
"
exclaimed
Peter
,
gazing
after
him
,
"
the
train
is
laid
;
the
spark
has
been
applied
;
the
explosion
will
soon
follow
.
<EOS>
The
hour
is
fast
approaching
when
I
shall
behold
this
accursed
house
shaken
to
dust
,
and
when
my
long
-
delayed
vengeance
will
be
gratified
.
<EOS>
In
that
hope
I
am
content
to
drag
on
the
brief
remnant
of
my
days
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
I
must
not
omit
the
stimulant
.
<EOS>
In
a
short
time
I
may
not
require
it
.
"
<EOS>
Draining
the
bottle
to
the
last
drop
,
he
flung
it
from
him
,
and
commenced
chanting
,
in
a
high
key
and
cracked
voice
,
a
wild
ditty
,
the
words
of
which
ran
as
follow
:

.
<EOS>
Peter
had
not
been
gone
many
seconds
,
when
a
dark
figure
,
muffled
in
a
wide
black
mantle
,
emerged
from
among
the
tombs
surrounding
the
church
;
gazed
after
him
for
a
few
seconds
,
and
then
,
with
a
menacing
gesture
,
retreated
behind
the
ivied
buttresses
of
the
gray
old
pile
.

<EOS>
LUKE
<EOS>
'S
<EOS>
first
impulse
had
been
to
free
himself
from
the
restraint
imposed
by
his
grandsire
's
society
.
<EOS>
He
longed
to
commune
with
himself
.
<EOS>
Leaping
the
small
boundary
-
wall
,
which
defended
the
churchyard
from
a
deep
green
lane
,
he
hurried
along
in
a
direction
contrary
to
that
taken
by
the
sexton
,
making
the
best
of
his
way
until
he
arrived
at
a
gap
in
the
high
-
banked
hazel
hedge
which
overhung
the
road
.
<EOS>
Heedless
of
the
impediments
thrown
in
his
way
by
the
undergrowth
of
a
rough
ring
fence
,
he
struck
through
the
opening
that
presented
itself
,
and
,
climbing
over
the
moss
-
grown
paling
,
trod
presently
upon
the
elastic
sward
of
Rookwood
Park
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
'
rapid
walking
brought
him
to
the
summit
of
a
rising
ground
crowned
with
aged
oaks
and
,
as
he
passed
beneath
their
broad
shadows
,
his
troubled
spirit
,
soothed
by
the
quietude
of
the
scene
,
in
part
resumed
its
serenity
.
<EOS>
Luke
yielded
to
the
gentle
influence
of
the
time
and
hour
.
<EOS>
The
stillness
of
the
spot
allayed
the
irritation
of
his
frame
,
and
the
dewy
chillness
cooled
the
fever
of
his
brow
.
<EOS>
Leaning
for
support
against
the
gnarled
trunk
of
one
of
the
trees
,
he
gave
himself
up
to
contemplation
.
<EOS>
The
events
of
the
last
hour
—
of
his
whole
existence
—
passed
in
rapid
review
before
him
.
<EOS>
The
thought
of
the
wayward
,
vagabond
life
he
had
led
;
of
the
wild
adventures
of
his
youth
;
of
all
he
had
been
;
of
all
he
had
done
,
of
all
he
had
endured
—
crowded
his
mind
;
and
then
,
like
the
passing
of
a
cloud
flitting
across
the
autumnal
moon
,
and
occasionally
obscuring
the
smiling
landscape
before
him
,
his
soul
was
shadowed
by
the
remembrance
of
the
awful
revelations
of
the
last
hour
,
and
the
fearful
knowledge
he
had
acquired
of
his
mother
's
fate
—
of
his
father
's
guilt
.
<EOS>
The
eminence
on
which
he
stood
was
one
of
the
highest
points
of
the
park
,
and
commanded
a
view
of
the
hall
,
which
might
be
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
,
discernible
through
a
broken
vista
of
trees
,
its
whitened
walls
glimmering
in
the
moonlight
,
and
its
tall
chimney
spiring
far
from
out
the
round
masses
of
wood
in
which
it
lay
embosomed
.
<EOS>
The
ground
gradually
sloped
in
that
direction
,
occasionally
rising
into
swells
,
studded
with
magnificent
timber
—
dipping
into
smooth
dells
,
or
stretching
out
into
level
glades
,
until
it
suddenly
sank
into
a
deep
declivity
,
that
formed
an
effectual
division
,
without
the
intervention
of
a
haw
-
haw
,
or
other
barrier
,
between
the
chase
and
the
home
-
park
.
<EOS>
A
slender
stream
strayed
through
this
ravine
,
having
found
its
way
thither
from
a
small
reservoir
,
hidden
in
the
higher
plantations
to
the
left
;
and
further
on
,
in
the
open
ground
,
and
in
a
line
with
the
hall
,
though
,
of
course
,
much
below
the
level
of
the
building
,
assisted
by
many
local
springs
,
and
restrained
by
a
variety
of
natural
and
artificial
embankments
,
this
brook
spread
out
into
an
expansive
sheet
of
water
.
<EOS>
Crossed
by
a
rustic
bridge
,
the
only
communication
between
the
parks
,
the
pool
found
its
outlet
into
the
meads
below
;
and
even
at
that
distance
,
and
in
that
still
hour
,
you
might
almost
catch
the
sound
of
the
brawling
waters
,
as
they
dashed
down
the
weir
in
a
foaming
cascade
;
while
,
far
away
,
in
the
spreading
valley
,
the
serpentine
meanderings
of
the
slender
current
might
be
traced
,
glittering
like
silvery
threads
in
the
moonshine
.
<EOS>
The
mild
beams
of
the
queen
of
night
,
then
in
her
meridian
,
trembled
upon
the
topmost
branches
of
the
tall
timber
,
quivering
like
diamond
spray
upon
the
outer
foliage
;
and
,
penetrating
through
the
interstices
of
the
trees
,
fell
upon
the
light
wreaths
of
vapor
then
beginning
to
arise
from
the
surface
of
the
pool
,
steeping
them
in
misty
splendor
,
and
lending
to
this
part
of
the
picture
a
character
of
dreamy
and
unearthly
beauty
.
<EOS>
All
else
was
in
unison
.
<EOS>
No
sound
interrupted
the
silence
of
Luke
's
solitude
,
except
the
hooting
of
a
large
gray
owl
,
that
,
scared
at
his
approach
,
or
in
search
of
prey
,
winged
its
spectral
flight
in
continuous
and
mazy
circles
round
his
head
,
uttering
at
each
wheel
its
startling
whoop
;
or
a
deep
,
distant
bay
,
that
ever
and
anon
boomed
upon
the
ear
,
proceeding
from
a
pack
of
hounds
kennelled
in
a
shed
adjoining
the
pool
before
mentioned
,
but
which
was
shrouded
from
view
by
the
rising
mist
.
<EOS>
No
living
objects
presented
themselves
,
save
a
herd
of
deer
,
crouched
in
a
covert
of
brown
fern
beneath
the
shadow
of
a
few
stunted
trees
,
immediately
below
the
point
of
land
on
which
Luke
stood
;
and
although
their
branching
antlers
could
scarcely
be
detected
from
the
ramifications
of
the
wood
itself
,
they
escaped
not
his
practised
ken
.
"How
<EOS>
often
,
"
murmured
Luke
,
"
in
years
gone
by
,
have
I
traversed
these
moonlit
glades
,
and
wandered
amidst
these
woodlands
,
on
nights
heavenly
as
this
—
ay
,
and
to
some
purpose
,
as
yon
thinned
herd
might
testify
!
<EOS>
Every
dingle
,
every
dell
,
every
rising
brow
,
every
bosky
vale
and
shelving
covert
,
have
been
as
familiar
to
my
track
as
to
that
of
the
fleetest
and
freest
of
their
number
:
scarce
a
tree
amidst
the
thickest
of
yon
outstretching
forest
with
which
I
can
not
claim
acquaintance
;
'
tis
long
since
I
have
seen
them
.
<EOS>
By
Heavens
!
'
<EOS>
tis
beautiful
!
<EOS>
and
it
is
all
my
own
!
<EOS>
Can
I
forget
that
it
was
here
I
first
emancipated
myself
from
thraldom
?
<EOS>
Can
I
forget
the
boundless
feeling
of
delight
that
danced
within
my
veins
when
I
first
threw
off
the
yoke
of
servitude
,
and
roved
unshackled
,
unrestrained
,
amidst
these
woods
?
<EOS>
The
wild
intoxicating
bliss
still
tingles
to
my
heart
.
<EOS>
And
they
are
all
my
own
—
my
own
!
<EOS>
Softly
,
what
have
we
there?"Luke
's
attention
was
arrested
by
an
object
which
could
not
fail
to
interest
him
,
sportsman
as
he
was
.
<EOS>
A
snorting
bray
was
heard
,
and
a
lordly
stag
stalked
slowly
and
majestically
from
out
the
copse
.
<EOS>
Luke
watched
the
actions
of
the
noble
animal
with
great
interest
,
drawing
back
into
the
shade
.
<EOS>
A
hundred
yards
,
or
thereabouts
,
might
be
between
him
and
the
buck
.
<EOS>
It
was
within
range
of
ball
.
<EOS>
Luke
mechanically
grasped
his
gun
;
yet
his
hand
had
scarcely
raised
the
piece
half
way
to
his
shoulder
,
when
he
dropped
it
again
to
its
rest
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
am
I
about
to
do
?
"
<EOS>
he
mentally
ejaculated
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
for
mere
pastime
,
should
I
take
away
yon
noble
creature
's
life
,
when
his
carcass
would
be
utterly
useless
to
me
?
<EOS>
Yet
such
is
the
force
of
habit
,
that
I
can
scarce
resist
the
impulse
that
tempted
me
to
fire
;
and
I
have
known
the
time
,
and
that
not
long
since
,
when
I
should
have
shown
no
such
self
-
control
.
<EOS>
"Unconscious
<EOS>
of
the
danger
it
had
escaped
,
the
animal
moved
forward
with
the
same
stately
step
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
it
stopped
,
with
ears
pricked
,
as
if
some
sound
had
smote
them
.
<EOS>
At
that
instant
the
click
of
a
gun
-
lock
was
heard
,
at
a
little
distance
to
the
right
.
<EOS>
The
piece
had
missed
fire
.
<EOS>
An
instantaneous
report
from
another
gun
succeeded
;
and
,
with
a
bound
high
in
air
,
the
buck
fell
upon
his
back
,
struggling
in
the
agonies
of
death
.
<EOS>
Luke
had
at
once
divined
the
cause
;
he
was
aware
that
poachers
were
at
hand
.
<EOS>
He
fancied
that
he
knew
the
parties
;
nor
was
he
deceived
in
his
conjecture
.
<EOS>
Two
figures
issued
instantly
from
a
covert
on
the
right
,
and
making
to
the
spot
,
the
first
who
reached
it
put
an
end
to
the
animal
's
struggles
by
plunging
a
knife
into
its
throat
.
<EOS>
The
affrighted
herd
took
to
their
heels
,
and
were
seen
darting
swiftly
down
the
chase
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
twain
,
meantime
,
was
occupied
in
feeling
for
the
deer
's
fat
,
when
he
was
approached
by
the
other
,
who
pointed
in
the
direction
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
former
raised
himself
from
his
kneeling
posture
,
and
both
appeared
to
listen
attentively
.
<EOS>
Luke
fancied
he
heard
a
slight
sound
in
the
distance
;
whatever
the
noise
proceeded
from
,
it
was
evident
the
deer
-
stealers
were
alarmed
.
<EOS>
They
laid
hold
of
the
buck
,
and
,
dragging
it
along
,
concealed
the
carcass
among
the
tall
fern
;
they
then
retreated
,
halting
for
an
instant
to
deliberate
,
within
a
few
yards
of
Luke
,
who
was
concealed
from
their
view
by
the
trunk
of
the
tree
,
behind
which
he
had
ensconced
his
person
.
<EOS>
They
were
so
near
,
that
he
lost
not
a
word
of
their
muttered
conference
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
game
's
spoiled
this
time
,
<EOS>
Rob
Rust
,
any
how
,
"
growled
one
,
in
an
angry
tone
;
"
the
hawks
are
upon
us
,
and
we
must
leave
this
brave
buck
to
take
care
of
himself
.
<EOS>
Curse
him!—who'd
'
a
'
thought
of
Hugh
Badger
's
quitting
his
bed
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
Respect
for
his
late
master
might
have
kept
him
quiet
the
night
before
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
But
look
out
,
lad
.
<EOS>
Dost
see
'
em?""Ay
,
thanks
to
old
Oliver
—
yonder
<EOS>
they
are
,
"
returned
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
One
—
two
—
three
—
and
a
muzzled
bouser
to
boot
.
<EOS>
There
's
Hugh
at
the
head
on
'em
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
stand
and
show
fight
?
<EOS>
I
have
half
a
mind
for
it
.
<EOS>
""No
,
no
,
"
replied
the
first
speaker
;
"
that
will
never
do
,
Rob
—
no
fighting
.
<EOS>
Why
run
the
risk
of
being
grabb'd
for
a
haunch
of
venison
?
<EOS>
Had
Luke
Bradley
or
Jack
Palmer
been
with
us
,
it
might
have
been
another
affair
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
it
wo
n't
pay
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
we
've
that
to
do
at
the
hall
to
-
morrow
night
that
may
make
men
of
us
for
the
rest
of
our
nat'ral
lives
.
<EOS>
We
've
pledged
ourselves
to
Jack
Palmer
,
and
we
ca
n't
be
off
in
honor
.
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
do
to
be
snabbled
in
the
nick
of
it
.
<EOS>
So
let
's
make
for
the
prad
in
the
lane
.
<EOS>
Keep
in
the
shade
as
much
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
Come
along
,
my
hearty
.
"
<EOS>
And
away
the
two
worthies
scampered
down
the
hill
-
side
.
<EOS>
"Shall
<EOS>
I
follow
,
"
thought
Luke
,
"
and
run
the
risk
of
falling
into
the
keeper
's
hand
,
just
at
this
crisis
,
too
?
<EOS>
No
,
<EOS>
but
if
I
am
found
here
,
I
shall
be
taken
for
one
of
the
gang
.
<EOS>
Something
must
be
done
—
ha!—devil
take
them
,
here
they
are
already
.
<EOS>
"Further
<EOS>
time
was
not
allowed
him
for
reflection
.
<EOS>
A
hoarse
baying
was
heard
,
followed
by
a
loud
cry
from
the
keepers
.
<EOS>
The
dog
had
scented
out
the
game
;
and
,
as
secrecy
was
no
longer
necessary
,
his
muzzle
had
been
removed
.
<EOS>
To
rush
forth
now
were
certain
betrayal
;
to
remain
was
almost
equally
assured
detection
;
and
,
doubting
whether
he
should
obtain
credence
if
he
delivered
himself
over
in
that
garb
and
armed
,
Luke
at
once
rejected
the
idea
.
<EOS>
Just
then
it
flashed
across
his
recollection
that
his
gun
had
remained
unloaded
,
and
he
applied
himself
eagerly
to
repair
this
negligence
,
when
he
heard
the
dog
in
full
cry
,
making
swiftly
in
his
direction
.
<EOS>
He
threw
himself
upon
the
ground
,
where
the
fern
was
thickest
;
but
this
seemed
insufficient
to
baffle
the
sagacity
of
the
hound
—
the
animal
had
got
his
scent
,
and
was
baying
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
The
keepers
were
drawing
nigh
.
<EOS>
Luke
gave
himself
up
for
lost
.
<EOS>
The
dog
,
however
,
stopped
where
the
two
poachers
had
halted
,
and
was
there
completely
at
fault
:
snuffing
the
ground
,
he
bayed
,
wheeled
round
,
and
then
set
off
with
renewed
barking
upon
their
track
.
<EOS>
Hugh
Badger
and
his
comrades
loitered
an
instant
at
the
same
place
,
looked
warily
round
,
and
then
,
as
Luke
conjectured
,
followed
the
course
taken
by
the
hound
.
<EOS>
Swift
as
thought
,
Luke
arose
,
and
keeping
as
much
as
possible
under
cover
of
the
trees
,
started
in
a
cross
line
for
the
lane
.
<EOS>
Rapid
as
was
his
flight
,
it
was
not
without
a
witness
:
<EOS>
one
of
the
keeper
's
assistants
,
who
had
lagged
behind
,
gave
the
view
-
halloo
in
a
loud
voice
.
<EOS>
Luke
pressed
forward
with
redoubled
energy
,
endeavoring
to
gain
the
shelter
of
the
plantation
,
and
this
he
could
readily
have
accomplished
,
had
no
impediment
been
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
But
his
rage
and
vexation
were
boundless
,
when
he
heard
the
keeper
's
cry
echoed
by
shouts
immediately
below
him
,
and
the
tongue
of
the
hound
resounding
in
the
hollow
.
<EOS>
He
turned
sharply
round
,
steering
a
middle
course
,
and
still
aiming
at
the
fence
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
,
from
the
cheers
of
his
pursuers
,
that
he
was
in
full
view
,
and
he
heard
them
encouraging
and
directing
the
dog
.
<EOS>
Luke
had
gained
the
park
palings
,
along
which
he
rushed
,
in
the
vain
quest
of
some
practicable
point
of
egress
,
for
the
fence
was
higher
in
this
part
of
the
park
than
elsewhere
,
owing
to
the
inequality
of
the
ground
.
<EOS>
He
had
cast
away
his
gun
as
useless
.
<EOS>
But
even
without
that
incumbrance
,
he
dared
not
hazard
the
delay
of
climbing
the
palings
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
a
deep
breathing
was
heard
close
behind
him
.
<EOS>
He
threw
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Within
a
few
yards
was
a
ferocious
bloodhound
,
with
whose
savage
nature
Luke
was
well
acquainted
;
the
breed
,
some
of
which
he
had
already
seen
,
having
been
maintained
at
the
hall
ever
since
the
days
of
grim
old
Sir
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
The
eyes
of
the
hound
were
glaring
,
blood
-
red
;
his
tongue
was
hanging
out
,
and
a
row
of
keen
white
fangs
was
displayed
,
like
the
teeth
of
a
shark
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
growl
—
a
leap
—
and
the
dog
was
close
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Luke
's
courage
was
undoubted
.
<EOS>
But
his
heart
failed
him
as
he
heard
the
roar
of
the
remorseless
brute
,
and
felt
that
he
could
not
avoid
an
encounter
with
the
animal
.
<EOS>
His
resolution
was
instantly
taken
:
he
stopped
short
with
such
suddenness
,
that
the
dog
,
when
in
the
act
of
springing
,
flew
past
him
with
great
violence
,
and
the
time
,
momentary
as
it
was
,
occupied
by
the
animal
in
recovering
himself
,
enabled
Luke
to
drop
on
his
knee
,
and
to
place
one
arm
,
like
a
buckler
,
before
his
face
,
while
he
held
the
other
in
readiness
to
grapple
his
adversary
.
<EOS>
Uttering
a
fierce
yell
,
the
hound
returned
to
the
charge
,
darting
at
Luke
,
who
received
the
assault
without
flinching
;
and
in
spite
of
a
severe
laceration
of
the
arm
,
he
seized
his
foe
by
the
throat
,
and
hurling
him
upon
the
ground
,
jumped
with
all
his
force
upon
his
belly
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
yell
of
agony
—
the
contest
was
ended
,
and
Luke
was
at
liberty
to
pursue
his
flight
unmolested
.
<EOS>
Brief
as
had
been
the
interval
required
for
this
combat
,
it
had
been
sufficient
to
bring
the
pursuers
within
sight
of
the
fugitive
.
<EOS>
Hugh
Badger
,
who
from
the
acclivity
had
witnessed
the
fate
of
his
favorite
,
with
a
loud
oath
discharged
the
contents
of
his
gun
at
the
head
of
its
destroyer
.
<EOS>
It
was
fortunate
for
Luke
that
at
this
instant
he
stumbled
over
the
root
of
a
tree
—
the
shot
rattled
in
the
leaves
as
he
fell
,
and
the
keeper
,
concluding
that
he
had
at
least
winged
his
bird
,
descended
more
leisurely
towards
him
.
<EOS>
As
he
lay
upon
the
ground
,
Luke
felt
that
he
was
wounded
;
whether
by
the
teeth
of
the
dog
,
from
a
stray
shot
,
or
from
bruises
inflicted
by
the
fall
,
he
could
not
determine
.
<EOS>
But
,
smarting
with
pain
,
he
resolved
to
wreak
his
vengeance
upon
the
first
person
who
approached
him
.
<EOS>
He
vowed
not
to
be
taken
with
life
—
to
strangle
any
who
should
lay
hands
upon
him
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
he
felt
a
pressure
at
his
breast
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
dead
hand
of
his
mother!Luke
shuddered
.
<EOS>
The
fire
of
revenge
was
quenched
.
<EOS>
He
mentally
cancelled
his
rash
oath
;
yet
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
surrender
at
discretion
,
and
without
further
effort
.
<EOS>
The
keeper
and
his
assistants
were
approaching
the
spot
where
he
lay
,
and
searching
for
his
body
.
<EOS>
Hugh
Badger
was
foremost
,
and
within
a
yard
of
him
.
<EOS>
"Confound
<EOS>
the
rascal
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
,
"
he
's
not
half
killed
<EOS>
;
he
seems
to
breathe
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
ere
the
speaker
was
dashed
backwards
,
and
lay
sprawling
upon
the
sod
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
and
unexpectedly
,
as
an
Indian
chief
might
rush
upon
his
foes
,
Luke
arose
,
dashing
himself
with
great
violence
against
Hugh
,
who
happened
to
stand
in
his
way
,
and
before
the
startled
assistants
,
who
were
either
too
much
taken
by
surprise
,
or
unwilling
to
draw
a
trigger
,
could
in
any
way
lay
hands
upon
him
,
exerting
all
the
remarkable
activity
which
he
possessed
<EOS>
,
he
caught
hold
of
a
projecting
branch
of
a
tree
,
and
swung
himself
,
at
a
single
bound
,
fairly
over
the
paling
.
<EOS>
Hugh
Badger
was
shortly
on
his
legs
,
swearing
lustily
at
his
defeat
.
<EOS>
Directing
his
men
to
skirt
alongside
the
fence
,
and
make
for
a
particular
part
of
the
plantation
which
he
named
,
and
snatching
a
loaded
fowling
-
piece
from
one
of
them
,
he
clambered
over
the
pales
,
and
guided
by
the
crashing
branches
and
other
sounds
conveyed
to
his
quick
ear
,
he
was
speedily
upon
Luke
's
track
.
<EOS>
The
plantation
through
which
the
chase
now
took
place
was
not
,
as
might
be
supposed
,
a
continuation
of
the
ring
fence
which
Luke
had
originally
crossed
on
his
entrance
into
the
park
,
though
girded
by
the
same
line
of
paling
,
but
,
in
reality
,
a
close
pheasant
preserve
,
occupying
the
banks
of
a
ravine
,
which
,
after
a
deep
and
tortuous
course
,
terminated
in
the
declivity
heretofore
described
as
forming
the
park
boundary
.
<EOS>
Luke
plunged
into
the
heart
of
this
defile
,
fighting
his
way
downwards
,
in
the
direction
of
the
brook
.
<EOS>
His
progress
was
impeded
by
a
thick
undergrowth
of
brier
,
and
other
matted
vegetation
,
as
well
as
by
the
entanglements
thrown
in
his
way
by
the
taller
bushes
of
thorn
and
hazel
,
the
entwined
and
elastic
branches
of
which
,
in
their
recoil
,
galled
and
fretted
him
,
by
inflicting
smart
blows
on
his
face
and
hands
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
hardship
he
usually
little
regarded
.
<EOS>
But
,
upon
the
present
occasion
,
it
had
the
effect
,
by
irritating
his
temper
,
of
increasing
the
thirst
of
vengeance
raging
in
his
bosom
.
<EOS>
Through
the
depths
of
the
ravine
welled
the
shallow
stream
before
alluded
to
,
and
Hugh
Badger
had
no
sooner
reached
its
sedgy
margin
than
he
lost
all
trace
of
the
fugitive
.
<EOS>
He
looked
cautiously
round
,
listened
intently
,
and
inclined
his
ear
to
catch
the
faintest
echo
.
<EOS>
All
was
still
:
not
a
branch
shook
,
not
a
leaf
rustled
.
<EOS>
Hugh
looked
aghast
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
sure
of
getting
a
glimpse
,
and
,
perhaps
,
a
stray
shot
at
the
"
poaching
rascal
,
"
as
he
termed
him
,
"
in
the
open
space
,
which
he
was
sure
the
fellow
was
aiming
to
reach
;
and
now
,
all
at
once
,
he
had
disappeared
,
like
a
will
-
o'-the
-
wisp
or
a
boggart
of
the
clough
.
"
<EOS>
However
,
he
could
not
be
far
off
,
and
Hugh
endeavored
to
obtain
some
clue
to
guide
him
in
his
quest
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
long
in
detecting
recent
marks
deeply
indented
in
the
mud
on
the
opposite
bank
.
<EOS>
Hugh
leaped
thither
at
once
.
<EOS>
Further
on
,
some
rushes
were
trodden
down
,
and
there
were
other
indications
of
the
course
the
fugitive
had
taken
.
<EOS>
"Hark
forward
!
"
shouted
Hugh
,
in
the
joy
of
his
heart
at
this
discovery
;
and
,
like
a
well
-
trained
dog
,
he
followed
up
with
alacrity
the
scent
he
had
opened
.
<EOS>
The
brook
presented
still
fewer
impediments
to
expedition
than
the
thick
copse
,
and
the
keeper
pursued
the
wanderings
of
the
petty
current
,
occasionally
splashing
into
the
stream
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
,
the
print
of
a
foot
on
the
soil
satisfied
him
he
was
in
the
right
path
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
became
aware
,
from
the
crumbling
soil
,
that
the
object
of
his
pursuit
had
scaled
the
bank
,
and
he
forthwith
moderated
his
pace
.
<EOS>
Halting
,
he
perceived
what
he
took
to
be
a
face
peeping
at
him
from
behind
a
knot
of
alders
that
overhung
the
steep
and
shelving
bank
immediately
above
him
.
<EOS>
His
gun
was
instantly
at
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"Come
<EOS>
down
,
you
infernal
deer
-
stealing
scoundrel
,
"
cried
Hugh
,
"
or
I
'll
blow
you
to
shivers
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
answer
was
returned
<EOS>
:
expostulation
was
vain
;
and
,
fearful
of
placing
himself
at
a
disadvantage
if
he
attempted
to
scale
the
bank
,
Hugh
fired
without
further
parley
.
<EOS>
The
sharp
discharge
rolled
in
echoes
down
the
ravine
,
and
a
pheasant
,
scared
by
the
sound
,
answered
the
challenge
from
a
neighboring
tree
.
<EOS>
Hugh
was
an
unerring
marksman
,
and
on
this
occasion
his
aim
had
been
steadily
taken
.
<EOS>
The
result
was
not
precisely
such
as
he
had
anticipated
.
<EOS>
A
fur
cap
,
shaken
by
the
shot
from
the
bough
on
which
it
hung
,
came
rolling
down
the
bank
,
proclaiming
the
ruse
that
had
been
practised
upon
the
keeper
.
<EOS>
Little
time
was
allowed
him
for
reflection
.
<EOS>
Before
he
could
reload
,
he
felt
himself
collared
by
the
iron
arm
of
Luke
.
<EOS>
Hugh
Badger
was
a
man
of
great
personal
strength
—
square
-
set
,
bandy
-
legged
,
with
a
prodigious
width
of
chest
,
and
a
frame
like
a
Hercules
,
and
,
energetic
as
was
Luke
's
assault
,
he
maintained
his
ground
without
flinching
.
<EOS>
The
struggle
was
desperate
.
<EOS>
Luke
was
of
slighter
proportion
,
though
exceeding
the
keeper
in
stature
by
the
head
and
shoulders
.
<EOS>
This
superiority
availed
him
little
.
<EOS>
It
was
rather
a
disadvantage
in
the
conflict
that
ensued
.
<EOS>
The
gripe
fastened
upon
Hugh
's
throat
was
like
that
of
a
clenched
vice
.
<EOS>
But
Luke
might
as
well
have
grappled
the
neck
of
a
bull
,
as
that
of
the
stalwart
keeper
.
<EOS>
Defending
himself
with
his
hobnail
boots
,
with
which
he
inflicted
several
severe
blows
upon
Luke
's
shins
,
and
struggling
vehemently
,
Hugh
succeeded
in
extricating
himself
from
his
throttling
grasp
;
he
then
closed
with
his
foe
,
and
they
were
locked
together
,
like
a
couple
of
bears
at
play
.
<EOS>
Straining
,
tugging
,
and
practising
every
sleight
and
stratagem
coming
within
the
scope
of
feet
,
knees
,
and
thighs
—
now
tripping
,
now
jerking
,
now
advancing
,
now
retreating
,
they
continued
the
strife
,
but
all
with
doubtful
result
.
<EOS>
Victory
,
at
length
,
seemed
to
declare
itself
in
favor
of
the
sturdy
keeper
.
<EOS>
Aware
of
his
opponent
's
strength
,
it
was
Luke
's
chief
endeavor
to
keep
his
lower
limbs
disengaged
,
and
to
trust
more
to
skill
than
force
for
ultimate
success
.
<EOS>
To
prevent
this
was
Hugh
's
grand
object
.
<EOS>
Guarding
himself
against
every
feint
,
he
ultimately
succeeded
in
firmly
grappling
his
agile
assailant
.
<EOS>
Luke
's
spine
was
almost
broken
by
the
shock
,
when
he
suddenly
gave
way
;
and
,
without
losing
his
balance
,
drew
his
adversary
forward
,
kicking
his
right
leg
from
under
him
.
<EOS>
With
a
crash
like
that
of
an
uprooted
oak
,
Hugh
fell
,
with
his
foe
upon
him
,
into
the
bed
of
the
rivulet
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
had
been
spoken
during
the
conflict
.
<EOS>
A
convulsive
groan
burst
from
Hugh
's
hardy
breast
.
<EOS>
His
hand
sought
his
girdle
,
but
in
vain
;
his
knife
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Gazing
upwards
,
his
dancing
vision
encountered
the
glimmer
of
the
blade
.
<EOS>
The
weapon
had
dropped
from
its
case
in
the
fall
.
<EOS>
Luke
brandished
it
before
his
eyes
.
"Villain
!
"
<EOS>
gasped
Hugh
,
ineffectually
struggling
to
free
himself
,
"
you
will
not
murder
me
?
"
<EOS>
And
his
efforts
to
release
himself
became
desperate
.
<EOS>
"No
,
"
answered
Luke
,
flinging
the
uplifted
knife
into
the
brook
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
do
that
,
though
thou
hast
twice
aimed
at
my
life
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
silence
thee
,
at
all
events
.
<EOS>
"
Saying
which
,
he
dealt
the
keeper
a
blow
on
the
head
that
terminated
all
further
resistance
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
Leaving
the
inert
mass
to
choke
up
the
current
,
with
whose
waters
the
blood
,
oozing
from
the
wound
,
began
to
commingle
,
Luke
prepared
to
depart
.
<EOS>
His
perils
were
not
yet
past
.
<EOS>
Guided
by
the
firing
,
the
report
of
which
alarmed
them
,
the
keeper
's
assistants
hastened
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
,
presenting
themselves
directly
in
the
path
<EOS>
Luke
was
about
to
take
.
<EOS>
He
had
either
to
retrace
his
steps
,
or
face
a
double
enemy
.
<EOS>
His
election
was
made
at
once
.
<EOS>
He
turned
and
fled
.
<EOS>
For
an
instant
the
men
tarried
with
their
bleeding
companion
.
<EOS>
They
then
dragged
him
from
the
brook
,
and
with
loud
oaths
followed
in
pursuit
.
<EOS>
Threading
,
for
a
second
time
,
the
bosky
labyrinth
,
Luke
sought
the
source
of
the
stream
.
<EOS>
This
was
precisely
the
course
his
enemies
would
have
desired
him
to
pursue
;
and
when
they
beheld
him
take
it
,
they
felt
confident
of
his
capture
.
<EOS>
The
sides
of
the
hollow
became
more
and
more
abrupt
as
they
advanced
,
though
they
were
less
covered
with
brushwood
.
<EOS>
The
fugitive
made
no
attempt
to
climb
the
bank
,
but
still
pressed
forward
.
<EOS>
The
road
was
tortuous
,
and
wound
round
a
jutting
point
of
rock
.
<EOS>
Now
he
was
a
fair
mark
—
<EOS>
no
,
he
had
swept
swiftly
by
,
and
was
out
of
sight
before
a
gun
could
be
raised
.
<EOS>
They
reached
the
same
point
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
before
them
,
but
his
race
was
nearly
run
.
<EOS>
Steep
,
slippery
rocks
,
shelving
down
to
the
edges
of
a
small
,
deep
pool
of
water
,
the
source
of
the
stream
,
formed
an
apparently
insurmountable
barrier
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
Rooted
—
<EOS>
Heaven
knows
how!—in
some
reft
or
fissure
of
the
rock
,
grew
a
wild
ash
,
throwing
out
a
few
boughs
over
the
solitary
pool
;
this
was
all
the
support
Luke
could
hope
for
,
should
he
attempt
to
scale
the
rock
.
<EOS>
The
rock
was
sheer
—
the
pool
deep
—
yet
still
he
hurried
on
.
<EOS>
He
reached
the
muddy
embankment
;
mounted
its
sides
;
and
seemed
to
hesitate
.
<EOS>
The
keepers
were
now
within
a
hundred
yards
of
him
.
<EOS>
Both
guns
were
discharged
.
<EOS>
And
,
sudden
as
the
reports
,
with
a
dead
,
splashless
plunge
,
like
a
diving
otter
,
the
fugitive
dropped
into
the
water
.
<EOS>
The
pursuers
were
at
the
brink
.
<EOS>
They
gazed
at
the
pool
.
<EOS>
A
few
bubbles
floated
upon
its
surface
,
and
burst
.
<EOS>
The
water
was
slightly
discolored
with
sand
.
<EOS>
No
ruddier
stain
crimsoned
the
tide
;
no
figure
rested
on
the
naked
rock
;
no
hand
clung
to
the
motionless
tree
.
<EOS>
"Devil
take
the
rascal
!
"
<EOS>
growled
one
<EOS>
;
"
I
hope
he
harn't
escaped
us
,
arter
all
.
<EOS>
""Noa
<EOS>
,
noa
,
he
be
fast
enough
<EOS>
,
never
fear
,
"
rejoined
the
other
;
"
sticking
like
a
snig
at
<EOS>
the
bottom
o
'
the
pond
;
and
,
dang
him
!
<EOS>
he
deserves
it
,
for
he
's
slipped
out
of
our
fingers
like
a
snig
often
enough
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
But
come
,
let
's
be
stumping
,
and
give
poor
Hugh
Badger
a
helping
hand
.
<EOS>
"Whereupon
<EOS>
they
returned
to
the
assistance
of
the
wounded
and
discomfited
keeper
.

THE

am
right
against
my
house
—

<EOS>
—
Yorkshire
Tragedy
.
<EOS>
ROOKWOOD
PLACE
was
a
fine
,
old
,
irregular
pile
,
of
considerable
size
,
presenting
a
rich
,
picturesque
outline
,
with
its
innumerable
gable
-
ends
,
its
fantastical
coigns
,
and
tall
crest
of
twisted
chimneys
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
uniformity
of
style
about
the
building
,
yet
the
general
effect
was
pleasing
and
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Its
very
irregularity
constituted
a
charm
.
<EOS>
Nothing
except
convenience
had
been
consulted
in
its
construction
:
additions
had
from
time
to
time
been
made
to
it
,
but
everything
dropped
into
its
proper
place
,
and
,
without
apparent
effort
or
design
,
grew
into
an
ornament
,
and
heightened
the
beauty
of
the
whole
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
in
short
,
one
of
those
glorious
manorial
houses
that
sometimes
unexpectedly
greet
us
in
our
wanderings
,
and
gladden
us
like
the
discovery
of
a
hidden
treasure
.
<EOS>
Some
such
ancestral
hall
we
have
occasionally
encountered
,
in
unlooked
-
for
quarters
,
in
our
native
county
of
Lancaster
,
or
in
its
smiling
sister
shire
;
and
never
without
feelings
of
intense
delight
,
rejoicing
to
behold
the
freshness
of
its
antiquity
,
and
the
greenness
of
its
old
age
.
<EOS>
For
,
be
it
observed
in
passing
,
a
Cheshire
or
Lancashire
hall
,
time
-
honored
though
it
be
,
with
its
often
renovated
black
and
white
squares
,
fancifully
filled
up
with
trefoils
and
quatrefoils
,
rosettes
,
and
other
figures
,
seems
to
bear
its
years
so
lightly
,
that
its
age
,
so
far
from
detracting
from
its
beauty
,
only
lends
it
a
grace
;
and
the
same
mansion
,
to
all
outward
appearance
,
fresh
and
perfect
as
it
existed
in
the
days
of
good
Queen
Bess
,
may
be
seen
in
admirable
preservation
in
the
days
of
the
youthful
Victoria
.
<EOS>
Such
is
Bramall
—
such
Moreton
,
and
many
another
<EOS>
we
might
instance
;
the
former
of
these
houses
may
,
perhaps
,
be
instanced
as
the
best
specimen
of
its
class,—and
its
class
in
our
opinion
,
is
the
best
—
to
be
met
with
in
Cheshire
,
considered
with
reference
either
to
the
finished
decoration
of
its
exterior
,
rich
in
the
chequered
coloring
we
have
alluded
to
,
preserved
with
a
care
and
neatness
almost
Dutch
,
or
to
the
consistent
taste
exhibited
by
its
possessor
to
the
restoration
and
maintenance
of
all
its
original
and
truly
national
beauty
within
doors
.
<EOS>
As
an
illustration
of
old
English
hospitality
—
that
real
,
hearty
hospitality
for
which
the
squirearchy
of
this
country
was
once
so
famous
—
Ah
!
why
have
they
bartered
it
for
other
customs
less
substantially
English?—it
may
be
mentioned
,
that
a
road
conducted
the
passenger
directly
through
the
great
hall
of
this
house
,
literally
"
of
entertainment
,
"
where
,
if
he
listed
,
strong
ale
,
and
other
refreshments
,
awaited
his
acceptance
and
courted
his
stay
.
<EOS>
Well
might
old
King
,
the
Cheshire
historian
,
in
the
pride
of
his
honest
heart
,
exclaim
,
"
I
know
divers
men
,
who
are
but
farmers
,
that
in
their
housekeeping
may
compare
with
a
lord
or
baron
,
in
some
countries
beyond
the
seas;—yea
,
although
I
named
a
higher
degree
,
I
were
able
to
justify
it
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
no
such
"
golden
farmers
"
in
these
degenerate
days!The
mansion
,
was
originally
built
by
Sir
Ranulph
de
Rookwood
—
or
,
as
it
was
then
written
,
Rokewode
—
the
first
of
the
name
,
a
stout
Yorkist
,
who
flourished
in
the
reign
of
Edward
IV
.
,
and
received
the
fair
domain
and
broad
lands
upon
which
the
edifice
was
raised
,
from
his
sovereign
,
in
reward
for
good
service
;
retiring
thither
in
the
decline
of
life
,
at
the
close
of
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
,
to
sequestrate
himself
from
scenes
of
strife
,
and
to
consult
his
spiritual
weal
in
the
erection
and
endowment
of
the
neighboring
church
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
mixed
architecture
,
and
combined
the
peculiarities
of
each
successive
era
.
<EOS>
Retaining
some
of
the
sterner
features
of
earlier
days
,
the
period
ere
yet
the
embattled
manor
-
house
peculiar
to
the
reigns
of
the
later
Henrys
had
been
merged
into
the
graceful
and
peaceable
hall
,
the
residence
of
the
Rookwoods
had
early
anticipated
the
gentler
characteristics
of
a
later
day
,
though
it
could
boast
little
of
that
exuberance
of
external
ornament
,
luxuriance
of
design
,
and
prodigality
of
beauty
,
which
,
under
the
sway
of
the
Virgin
Queen
,
distinguished
the
residence
of
the
wealthier
English
landowner
;
and
rendered
the
hall
of
Elizabeth
,
properly
so
called
,
the
pride
and
boast
of
our
domestic
architecture
.
<EOS>
The
site
selected
by
Sir
Ranulph
for
his
habitation
had
been
already
occupied
by
a
vast
fabric
of
oak
,
which
he
in
part
removed
,
though
some
vestiges
might
still
be
traced
of
that
ancient
pile
.
<EOS>
A
massive
edifice
succeeded
,
with
gate
and
tower
,
court
and
moat
complete
;
substantial
enough
,
one
would
have
thought
,
to
have
endured
for
centuries
.
<EOS>
But
even
this
ponderous
structure
grew
into
disuse
,
and
Sir
Ranulph
's
successors
,
remodelling
,
repairing
,
almost
rebuilding
the
whole
mansion
,
in
the
end
so
metamorphosed
its
aspect
,
that
at
last
little
of
its
original
and
distinctive
character
remained
.
<EOS>
Still
,
as
we
said
before
,
it
was
a
fine
old
house
,
though
some
changes
had
taken
place
for
the
worse
,
which
could
not
be
readily
pardoned
by
the
eye
of
taste
:
<EOS>
as
,
for
instance
,
the
deep
embayed
windows
had
dwindled
into
modernized
casements
,
of
lighter
construction
;
<EOS>
the
wide
porch
,
with
its
flight
of
steps
leading
to
the
great
hall
of
entrance
,
had
yielded
to
a
narrow
door
;
and
the
broad
quadrangular
court
was
succeeded
by
a
gravel
drive
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
despite
all
these
changes
,
the
house
of
the
Rookwoods
,
for
an
old
house
—
and
,
after
all
,
what
is
like
an
old
house?—was
no
undesirable
or
uncongenial
abode
for
any
worshipful
country
gentleman
"
who
had
a
great
estate
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
hall
was
situated
near
the
base
of
a
gently
declining
hill
,
terminating
a
noble
avenue
of
limes
,
and
partially
embosomed
in
an
immemorial
wood
of
the
same
timber
,
which
had
given
its
name
to
the
family
that
dwelt
amongst
its
rook
-
haunted
shades
.
<EOS>
Descending
the
avenue
,
at
the
point
of
access
afforded
by
a
road
that
wound
down
the
hill
-
side
,
towards
a
village
distant
about
half
a
mile
,
as
you
advanced
,
the
eye
was
first
arrested
by
a
singular
octagonal
turret
of
brick
,
of
more
recent
construction
than
the
house
;
and
in
all
probability
occupying
the
place
where
the
gateway
stood
of
yore
.
<EOS>
This
tower
rose
to
a
height
corresponding
with
the
roof
of
the
mansion
;
and
was
embellished
on
the
side
facing
the
house
with
a
flamingly
gilt
dial
,
peering
,
like
an
impudent
observer
,
at
all
that
passed
within
doors
.
<EOS>
Two
apartments
,
which
it
contained
,
were
appropriated
to
the
house
-
porter
.
<EOS>
Despoiled
of
its
martial
honors
,
the
gateway
still
displayed
the
achievements
of
the
family
—
the
rook
and
the
fatal
branch
—
carved
in
granite
,
which
had
resisted
the
storms
of
two
centuries
,
though
stained
green
with
moss
,
and
mapped
over
with
lichens
.
<EOS>
To
the
left
,
overgrown
with
ivy
,
and
peeping
from
out
a
tuft
of
trees
,
appeared
the
hoary
summit
of
a
dovecot
,
indicating
the
near
neighborhood
of
an
ancient
barn
,
contemporary
with
the
earliest
dwelling
-
house
,
and
of
a
little
world
of
offices
and
outbuildings
buried
in
the
thickness
of
the
foliage
.
<EOS>
To
the
right
was
the
garden
—
the
pleasaunce
of
the
place
—
formal
,
precise
,
old
-
fashioned
,
artificial
,
yet
exquisite!—for
commend
us
to
the
bygone
,
beautiful
English
garden
—
really
a
garden
—
<EOS>
not
that
mixture
of
park
,
meadow
,
and
wilderness[3

,
brought
up
to
one
's
very
windows
—
which
,
since
the
days
of
the
innovators
,
Kent
,
and
his
"
bold
associates
,
"
Capability
Brown
and
Co.
,
has
obtained
so
largely
—
this
was
a
garden
!
<EOS>
There
might
be
seen
the
stately
terraces
,
such
as
Watteau
,
and
our
own
Wilson
,
in
his
earlier
works
,
painted
—
the
trim
alleys
exhibiting
all
the
triumphs
of
topiarian
art
—
The
sidelong
wallsOf

the
holly

prickly
arms
,
Trimm'd
into
high
arcades
;
the
tonsile

Wove
in
mosaic
mode
of
many
a

Around
the
figured
carpet
of
the

gayest
of
parterres
and
greenest
of
lawns
,
with
its
admonitory
sun

,
its

basin
in

,
its
fountain

;
the
quaint
summer

house
,
surmounted
with
its
gilt
vane
;
the
statue
,
glimmering
from
out
its
covert
of
leaves
;
the
cool
cascade
,
the
urns
,
the
bowers
,
and
a
hundred
luxuries
besides
,
suggested
and
contrived
by
Art
to
render
Nature
most
enjoyable
,
and
to
enhance
the
recreative
delights
of
home
-
out

of

doors
—
for
such
a
garden
should
be
—
,
with
least
sacrifice
of
indoor
comfort
and
convenience
.
<EOS>
When
Epicurus
to
the
world
had
taught
,
That
pleasure
was
the
chiefest
good;—And
<EOS>
was
perhaps
i
'
th
'
<EOS>
right
,
if
rightly
understood
,
His
life
he
to
his
doctrine
brought
—
<EOS>
And
in
his
garden
's
shade
that
sovereign
pleasure
sought.[5]All
<EOS>
these
delights
might
once
have
been
enjoyed
.
<EOS>
But
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
,
this
fair
garden
was
for
the
most
part
a
waste
.
<EOS>
Ill
-
kept
,
and
unregarded
,
the
gay
parterres
were
disfigured
with
weeds
;
grass
grew
on
the
gravel
walk
;
several
of
the
urns
were
overthrown
;
the
hour
upon
the
dial
was
untold
;
the
fountain
was
choked
up
,
and
the
smooth
-
shaven
lawn
only
rescued
,
it
would
seem
,
from
the
general
fate
,
that
it
might
answer
the
purpose
of
a
bowling
-
green
,
as
the
implements
of
that
game
,
scattered
about
,
plainly
testified
.
<EOS>
Diverging
from
the
garden
to
the
house
,
we
have
before
remarked
that
the
more
ancient
and
characteristic
features
of
the
place
had
been
,
for
the
most
part
,
destroyed
;
less
by
the
hand
of
time
than
to
suit
the
tastes
of
different
proprietors
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
not
so
observable
in
the
eastern
wing
,
which
overlooked
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Here
might
be
discerned
many
indications
of
its
antiquity
.
<EOS>
The
strength
and
solidity
of
the
walls
,
which
had
not
been
,
as
elsewhere
,
masked
with
brickwork
;
the
low
,
Tudor
arches
;
the
mullioned
bars
of
the
windows
—
all
attested
its
age
.
<EOS>
This
wing
was
occupied
by
an
upper
and
lower
gallery
,
communicating
with
suites
of
chambers
,
for
the
most
part
deserted
,
excepting
one
or
two
,
which
were
used
as
dormitories
;
and
another
little
room
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
with
an
oriel
window
opening
upon
the
lawn
,
and
commanding
the
prospect
beyond
—
a
favorite
resort
of
the
late
Sir
Piers
.
<EOS>
The
interior
was
curious
for
his
honeycomb
ceiling
,
deeply
moulded
in
plaster
,
with
the
arms
and
alliances
of
the
Rookwoods
.
<EOS>
In
the
centre
was
the
royal
blazon
of
Elizabeth
,
who
had
once
honored
the
hall
with
a
visit
during
a
progress
,
and
whose
cipher
E.
R.
was
also
displayed
upon
the
immense
plate
of
iron
which
formed
the
fire
-
grate
.
<EOS>
To
return
,
for
a
moment
,
to
the
garden
,
which
we
linger
about
as
a
bee
around
a
flower
.
<EOS>
Below
the
lawn
there
was
another
terrace
,
edged
by
a
low
balustrade
of
stone
,
commanding
a
lovely
view
of
park
,
water
,
and
woodland
.
<EOS>
High
hanging
-
woods
waved
in
the
foreground
,
and
an
extensive
sweep
of
flat
champaign
country
stretched
out
to
meet
a
line
of
blue
,
hazy
hills
bounding
the
distant
horizon
.

CHAPTER
V.
—
SIR
REGINALD
ROOKWOODA
king
who
changed
his
wives
as
easily
as
a
woman
changes
her
dress
.
<EOS>
He
threw
aside
the
first
,
cut
off
the
second
's
head
,
the
third
he
disemboweled
:
as
for
the
fourth
,
he
pardoned
her
,
and
simply
turned
her
out
of
doors
,
but
to
make
matters
even
,
cut
off
the
head
of
number
five
.
<EOS>
—
Victor
Hugo
:
<EOS>
Marie
Tudor
.
<EOS>
FROM
the
house
to
its
inhabitants
the
transition
is
natural
.
<EOS>
Besides
the
connexion
between
them
,
there
were
many
points
of
resemblance
;
many
family
features
in
common
;
there
was
the
same
melancholy
grandeur
,
the
same
character
of
romance
,
the
same
fantastical
display
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
the
secret
passages
,
peculiar
to
the
one
,
wanting
to
the
history
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
Both
had
their
mysteries
.
<EOS>
One
blot
there
was
in
the
otherwise
proud
escutcheon
of
the
Rookwoods
,
that
dimmed
its
splendor
,
and
made
pale
its
pretensions
:
their
sun
was
eclipsed
in
blood
from
its
rising
to
its
meridian
;
and
so
it
seemed
would
be
its
setting
.
<EOS>
This
foul
reproach
attached
to
all
the
race
;
none
escaped
it
.
<EOS>
Traditional
rumors
were
handed
down
from
father
to
son
,
throughout
the
county
,
and
,
like
all
other
rumors
,
had
taken
to
themselves
wings
,
and
flown
abroad
;
their
crimes
became
a
by
-
word
.
<EOS>
How
was
it
they
escaped
punishment
?
<EOS>
How
came
they
to
evade
the
hand
of
justice
?
<EOS>
Proof
was
ever
wanting
;
justice
was
ever
baffled
.
<EOS>
They
were
a
stern
and
stiff
-
necked
people
,
of
indomitable
pride
and
resolution
,
with
,
for
the
most
part
,
force
of
character
sufficient
to
enable
them
to
breast
difficulties
and
dangers
that
would
have
overwhelmed
ordinary
individuals
.
<EOS>
No
quality
is
so
advantageous
to
its
possessor
as
firmness
;
and
the
determined
energy
of
the
Rookwoods
bore
them
harmless
through
a
sea
of
trouble
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
they
were
wealthy
;
lavish
even
to
profusion
;
and
gold
will
do
much
,
if
skilfully
administered
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
despite
all
this
,
a
dark
,
ominous
cloud
settled
over
their
house
,
and
men
wondered
when
the
vengeance
of
Heaven
,
so
long
delayed
,
would
fall
and
consume
it
.
<EOS>
Possessed
of
considerable
landed
property
,
once
extending
over
nearly
half
the
West
Riding
of
Yorkshire
,
the
family
increased
in
power
and
importance
for
an
uninterrupted
series
of
years
,
until
the
outbreak
of
that
intestine
discord
which
ended
in
the
civil
wars
,
when
the
espousal
of
the
royalist
party
,
with
sword
and
substance
,
by
Sir
Ralph
Rookwood
,
the
then
lord
of
the
mansion
—
a
dissolute
,
depraved
personage
,
who
,
however
,
had
been
made
a
Knight
of
the
Bath
at
the
coronation
of
Charles
I.
—
,
ended
in
his
own
destruction
at
Naseby
,
and
the
wreck
of
much
of
his
property
;
a
loss
which
the
gratitude
of
Charles
II
.
,
<EOS>
on
his
restoration
,
did
not
fail
to
make
good
to
Sir
Ralph
's
youthful
heir
,
Reginald
.
<EOS>
Sir
Ralph
Rookwood
left
two
sons
,
Reginald
and
Alan
.
<EOS>
The
fate
of
the
latter
was
buried
in
obscurity
.
<EOS>
It
was
even
a
mystery
to
his
family
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
it
was
said
,
a
youth
of
much
promise
,
and
of
gentle
manners
;
who
,
having
made
an
imprudent
match
,
from
jealousy
,
or
some
other
motive
,
deserted
his
wife
,
and
fled
his
country
.
<EOS>
Various
reasons
were
assigned
for
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
Amongst
others
,
it
was
stated
that
the
object
of
Alan
's
jealous
suspicions
was
his
elder
brother
,
Reginald
;
and
that
it
was
the
discovery
of
his
wife
's
infidelity
in
this
quarter
which
occasioned
his
sudden
disappearance
with
his
infant
daughter
.
<EOS>
Some
said
he
died
abroad
.
<EOS>
Others
,
that
he
had
appeared
again
for
a
brief
space
at
the
hall
.
<EOS>
But
all
now
concurred
in
a
belief
of
his
decease
.
<EOS>
Of
his
child
nothing
was
known
.
<EOS>
His
inconstant
wife
,
after
enduring
for
some
years
the
agonies
of
remorse
,
abandoned
by
Sir
Reginald
,
and
neglected
by
her
own
relatives
,
put
an
end
to
her
existence
by
poison
.
<EOS>
This
is
all
that
could
be
gathered
of
the
story
,
or
the
misfortunes
of
Alan
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
The
young
Sir
Reginald
had
attended
Charles
,
in
the
character
of
page
,
during
his
exile
;
and
if
he
could
not
requite
the
devotion
of
the
son
,
by
absolutely
reinstating
the
fallen
fortunes
of
the
father
,
the
monarch
could
at
least
accord
him
the
fostering
influence
of
his
favor
and
countenance
;
and
bestow
upon
him
certain
lucrative
situations
in
his
household
,
as
an
earnest
of
his
good
-
will
.
<EOS>
And
thus
much
he
did
.
<EOS>
Remarkable
for
his
personal
attractions
in
youth
,
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
we
should
find
the
name
of
Reginald
Rookwood
recorded
in
the
scandalous
chronicles
of
the
day
,
as
belonging
to
a
cavalier
of
infinite
address
and
discretion
,
matchless
wit
,
and
marvellous
pleasantry
;
and
eminent
beyond
his
peers
for
his
successes
with
some
of
the
most
distinguished
beauties
who
ornamented
that
brilliant
and
voluptuous
court
.
<EOS>
A
career
of
elegant
dissipation
ended
in
matrimony
.
<EOS>
His
first
match
was
unpropitious
.
<EOS>
Foiled
in
his
attempts
upon
the
chastity
of
a
lady
of
great
beauty
and
high
honor
,
he
was
rash
enough
to
marry
her
;
rash
,
we
say
,
for
from
that
fatal
hour
all
became
as
darkness
;
the
curtain
fell
upon
the
comedy
of
his
life
,
to
rise
to
tragic
horrors
.
<EOS>
When
,
passion
subsided
,
repentance
awoke
,
and
he
became
anxious
for
deliverance
from
the
fetters
he
had
so
heedlessly
imposed
on
himself
,
and
on
his
unfortunate
dame
.
<EOS>
The
hapless
lady
of
Sir
Reginald
was
a
fair
and
fragile
creature
,
floating
on
the
eddying
current
of
existence
,
and
hurried
in
destruction
as
the
summer
gossamer
is
swept
away
by
the
rude
breeze
,
and
lost
forever
.
<EOS>
So
beautiful
,
so
gentle
was
she
,
that
if
,
Sorrow
had
not
madeSorrow
more
beautiful
than
Beauty
's
self
,
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
say
whether
the
charm
of
softness
and
sweetness
was
more
to
be
admired
than
her
faultless
personal
attractions
.
<EOS>
But
when
a
tinge
of
melancholy
came
,
saddening
and
shading
the
once
smooth
and
smiling
brow
;
when
tears
dimmed
the
blue
beauty
of
those
deep
and
tender
eyes
;
when
hot
,
hectic
flushes
supplied
the
place
of
healthful
bloom
,
and
despair
took
possession
of
her
heart
,
then
was
it
seen
whatwas
the
charm
of
Lady
Rookwood
,
if
charm
that
could
be
called
which
was
a
saddening
sight
to
see
,
and
melted
the
beholder
's
soul
within
him
.
<EOS>
All
acknowledged
,
that
exquisite
as
she
had
been
before
,
the
sad
,
sweet
lady
was
now
more
exquisite
still
.
<EOS>
Seven
moons
had
waned
and
flown
—
seven
bitter
,
tearful
moons
—
and
each
day
Lady
Rookwood
's
situation
claimed
more
soothing
attention
at
the
hand
of
her
lord
.
<EOS>
About
this
time
his
wife
's
brother
,
whom
he
hated
,
returned
from
the
Dutch
wars
.
<EOS>
Struck
with
his
sister
's
altered
appearance
,
he
readily
divined
the
cause
;
indeed
,
all
tongues
were
eager
to
proclaim
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
Passionately
attached
to
her
,
Lionel
Vavasour
implored
an
explanation
of
the
cause
of
his
sister
's
griefs
.
<EOS>
The
bewildered
lady
answered
evasively
,
attributing
her
woe
-
begone
looks
to
any
other
cause
than
her
husband
's
cruelty
;
and
pressing
her
brother
,
as
he
valued
her
peace
,
her
affection
,
never
to
allude
to
the
subject
again
.
<EOS>
The
fiery
youth
departed
.
<EOS>
He
next
sought
out
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
and
taxed
him
sharply
with
his
inhumanity
,
adding
threats
to
his
upbraidings
.
<EOS>
Sir
Reginald
listened
silently
and
calmly
.
<EOS>
When
the
other
had
finished
,
with
a
sarcastic
obeisance
,
he
replied
:
"
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
am
much
beholden
for
the
trouble
you
have
taken
in
your
sister
's
behalf
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
entrusted
herself
to
my
keeping
,
she
relinquished
,
I
conceive
,
all
claim
on
your
guardianship
:
however
,
I
thank
you
for
the
trouble
you
have
taken
;
but
,
for
your
own
sake
,
I
would
venture
to
caution
you
against
a
repetition
of
interference
like
the
present
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
,
sir
,
caution
you
.
<EOS>
See
that
you
give
heed
to
my
words
,
or
,
by
the
heaven
above
us
!
<EOS>
I
will
enforce
attention
to
them
.
<EOS>
""You
will
find
me
,
sir
,
as
prompt
at
all
times
to
defend
my
conduct
,
as
I
am
unalterable
in
my
purposes
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
is
my
wife
.
<EOS>
What
more
would
you
have
?
<EOS>
Were
she
a
harlot
<EOS>
,
you
should
have
her
back
and
welcome
.
<EOS>
The
tool
is
virtuous
.
<EOS>
Devise
some
scheme
,
and
take
her
with
you
hence
<EOS>
—
so
you
rid
me
of
her
<EOS>
I
am
content
.
<EOS>
""Rookwood
,
you
are
a
villain
.
"
<EOS>
And
Vavasour
spat
upon
his
brother
's
cheek
.
<EOS>
Sir
Reginald
's
eyes
blazed
.
<EOS>
His
sword
started
from
its
scabbard
.
"
<EOS>
Defend
yourself
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
furiously
attacking
Vavasour
.
<EOS>
Pass
after
pass
was
exchanged
.
<EOS>
Fierce
thrusts
were
made
and
parried
.
<EOS>
Feint
and
appeal
,
the
most
desperate
and
dexterous
,
were
resorted
to
.
<EOS>
Their
swords
glanced
like
lightning
flashes
.
<EOS>
In
the
struggle
,
the
blades
became
entangled
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
moment
's
cessation
.
<EOS>
Each
glanced
at
the
other
with
deadly
,
inextinguishable
hate
.
<EOS>
Both
were
admirable
masters
of
the
art
of
defence
.
<EOS>
Both
were
so
brimful
of
wrath
as
to
be
regardless
of
consequences
.
<EOS>
They
tore
back
their
weapons
.
<EOS>
Vavasour
's
blade
shivered
.
<EOS>
He
was
at
the
mercy
of
his
adversary
—
an
adversary
who
knew
no
mercy
.
<EOS>
Sir
Reginald
passed
his
rapier
through
his
brother
's
body
.
<EOS>
The
hilt
struck
against
his
ribs
.
<EOS>
Sir
Reginald
's
ire
was
kindled
,
not
extinguished
,
by
the
deed
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
Like
the
tiger
,
he
had
tasted
blood
—
like
the
tiger
,
he
thirsted
for
more
.
<EOS>
He
sought
his
home
.
<EOS>
He
was
greeted
by
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Terrified
by
his
looks
,
she
yet
summoned
courage
sufficient
to
approach
him
.
<EOS>
She
embraced
his
arm
—
she
clasped
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Sir
Reginald
smiled
.
<EOS>
His
smile
was
cutting
as
his
dagger
's
edge
.
<EOS>
"What
ails
you
,
sweetheart
?
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
know
not
;
your
smile
frightens
me
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
smile
frightens
<EOS>
you
—
fool
!
<EOS>
be
thankful
that
I
frown
not
.
<EOS>
""Oh
!
<EOS>
do
not
frown
.
<EOS>
Be
gentle
,
my
Reginald
,
as
you
were
when
first
I
knew
you
.
<EOS>
Smile
not
so
coldly
,
but
as
you
did
then
,
that
I
may
,
for
one
instant
,
dream
you
love
me
.
<EOS>
""Silly
<EOS>
wench
!
<EOS>
There
—
I
do
smile
.
<EOS>
""That
smile
freezes
me
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Reginald
,
could
you
but
know
what
I
have
endured
this
morning
,
on
your
account
.
<EOS>
My
brother
Lionel
has
been
here
.
""Indeed!""Nay
,
look
not
so
.
<EOS>
He
insisted
on
knowing
the
reason
of
my
altered
appearance
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
no
doubt
you
made
him
acquainted
with
the
cause
.
<EOS>
You
told
him
your
version
of
the
story
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
a
word
,
as
I
hope
to
live
.
<EOS>
""A
<EOS>
lie!""By
my
truth
,
no
.
<EOS>
""A
lie
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
He
avouched
it
to
me
himself
.
<EOS>
""Impossible
!
<EOS>
He
could
not
—
would
not
disobey
me
.
"Sir
<EOS>
Reginald
laughed
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
would
not
,
I
am
sure
,
give
utterance
to
any
scandal
,
"
continued
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"
You
say
this
but
to
try
me
,
do
you
not?—ha
!
<EOS>
what
is
this
?
<EOS>
Your
hand
is
bloody
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
harmed
him
?
<EOS>
Whose
blood
is
this?""Your
brother
spat
upon
my
check
.
<EOS>
I
have
washed
out
the
stain
,
"
replied
Sir
Reginald
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
it
is
his
blood
!
"
<EOS>
shrieked
Lady
Rookwood
,
pressing
her
hand
shuddering
before
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
he
dead?"Sir
<EOS>
Reginald
turned
away
.
<EOS>
"Stay
,
"
she
cried
,
exerting
her
feeble
strength
to
retain
him
,
and
becoming
white
as
ashes
,
"
abide
and
hear
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
killed
me
,
I
feel
,
by
your
cruelty
.
<EOS>
I
am
sinking
fast
—
dying
.
<EOS>
I
,
who
loved
you
,
only
you
;
yes
,
one
besides
—
my
brother
,
and
you
have
slain
him
.
<EOS>
Your
hands
are
dripping
in
his
blood
,
and
I
have
kissed
them
—
have
clasped
them
!
<EOS>
And
now
,
"
continued
she
,
with
an
energy
that
shook
Sir
Reginald
,
"
I
hate
you
<EOS>
—
I
renounce
you
—
forever
!
<EOS>
May
my
dying
words
ring
in
your
ears
on
your
death
-
bed
,
for
that
hour
will
come
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
shun
that
.
<EOS>
Then
think
of
him
!
<EOS>
think
of
me!""Away
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Sir
Reginald
,
endeavoring
to
shake
her
off
.
<EOS>
"I
will
not
away
!
<EOS>
I
will
cling
to
you
—
will
curse
you
.
<EOS>
My
unborn
child
shall
live
to
curse
you
—
to
requite
you
—
to
visit
my
wrongs
on
you
and
yours
.
<EOS>
Weak
as
I
am
,
you
shall
not
cast
me
off
.
<EOS>
You
shall
learn
to
fear
even
me
.
<EOS>
""I
fear
nothing
living
,
much
less
a
frantic
woman
.
<EOS>
""Fear
<EOS>
the
dead
,
then
.
<EOS>
"There
was
a
struggle
—
a
blow
—
and
the
wretched
lady
sank
,
shrieking
,
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Convulsions
seized
her
.
<EOS>
A
mother
's
pains
succeeded
fierce
and
fast
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
no
more
,
but
died
within
the
hour
,
giving
birth
to
a
female
child
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
Rookwood
became
her
father
's
idol
—
her
father
's
bane
.
<EOS>
All
the
love
he
had
to
bestow
was
centred
in
her
.
<EOS>
She
returned
it
not
.
<EOS>
She
fled
from
his
caresses
.
<EOS>
With
all
her
mother
's
beauty
,
she
had
all
her
father
's
pride
.
<EOS>
Sir
Reginald
's
every
thought
was
for
his
daughter
—
for
her
aggrandizement
.
<EOS>
In
vain
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
only
to
endure
him
,
and
while
his
affection
waxed
stronger
,
and
entwined
itself
round
her
alone
,
she
withered
beneath
his
embraces
as
the
shrub
withers
in
the
clasping
folds
of
the
parasite
plant
.
<EOS>
She
grew
towards
womanhood
.
<EOS>
Suitors
thronged
around
her
—
gentle
and
noble
ones
.
<EOS>
Sir
Reginald
watched
them
with
a
jealous
eye
.
<EOS>
He
was
wealthy
,
powerful
,
high
in
royal
favor
;
and
could
make
his
own
election
.
<EOS>
He
did
so
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
,
Eleanor
promised
obedience
to
his
wishes
.
<EOS>
They
accorded
with
her
own
humor
.
<EOS>
The
day
was
appointed
.
<EOS>
It
came
.
<EOS>
But
with
it
came
not
the
bride
.
<EOS>
She
had
fled
,
with
the
humblest
and
the
meanest
of
the
pretenders
to
her
hand
—
with
one
upon
whom
Sir
Reginald
supposed
she
had
not
deigned
to
cast
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
endeavored
to
forget
her
,
and
,
to
all
outward
seeming
,
was
successful
in
the
effort
.
<EOS>
But
he
felt
that
the
curse
was
upon
him
;
the
undying
flame
scorched
his
heart
.
<EOS>
Once
,
and
once
only
,
they
met
again
,
in
France
,
whither
she
had
wandered
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
dread
encounter
—
terrible
to
both
;
but
most
so
to
Sir
Reginald
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
not
of
her
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
the
death
of
his
first
wife
,
Sir
Reginald
had
made
proposals
to
a
dowager
of
distinction
,
with
a
handsome
jointure
,
one
of
his
early
attachments
,
and
was
,
without
scruple
,
accepted
.
<EOS>
The
power
of
the
family
might
then
be
said
to
be
at
its
zenith
;
and
but
for
certain
untoward
circumstances
,
and
the
growing
influence
of
his
enemies
,
Sir
Reginald
would
have
been
elevated
to
the
peerage
.
<EOS>
Like
most
reformed
spend
-
thrifts
,
he
had
become
proportionately
avaricious
,
and
his
mind
seemed
engrossed
in
accumulating
wealth
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
his
second
wife
followed
her
predecessor
,
dying
,
it
was
said
,
of
vexation
and
disappointment
.
<EOS>
The
propensity
to
matrimony
,
always
a
distinguishing
characteristic
of
the
Rookwoods
,
largely
displayed
itself
in
Sir
Reginald
.
<EOS>
Another
dame
followed
—
equally
rich
,
younger
,
and
far
more
beautiful
than
her
immediate
predecessor
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
prodigious
flirt
,
and
soon
set
her
husband
at
defiance
.
<EOS>
Sir
Reginald
did
not
condescend
to
expostulate
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
his
way
.
<EOS>
He
effectually
prevented
any
recurrence
of
her
indiscretions
.
<EOS>
She
was
removed
,
and
with
her
<EOS>
expired
Sir
Reginald
's
waning
popularity
.
<EOS>
So
strong
was
the
expression
of
odium
against
him
,
that
he
thought
it
prudent
to
retire
to
his
mansion
,
in
the
country
,
and
there
altogether
seclude
himself
.
<EOS>
One
anomaly
in
Sir
Reginald
's
otherwise
utterly
selfish
character
was
uncompromising
devotion
to
the
house
of
Stuart
;
and
shortly
after
the
abdication
of
James
II
.
,
he
followed
that
monarch
to
Saint
Germain
,
having
previously
mixed
largely
in
secret
political
intrigues
;
and
only
returned
from
the
French
court
to
lay
his
bones
with
those
of
his
ancestry
,
in
the
family
vault
at
Rookwood
.

CHAPTER
VI
.
—
<EOS>
SIR
PIERS
ROOKWOODMy
old
master
kept
a
good
house
,
and
twenty
or
thirty
tall
sword
-
and
-
buckler
men
about
him
;
and
in
faith
his
son
differs
not
much
;
he
will
have
metal
too
;
though
he
has
no
store
of
cutler
's
blades
,
he
will
have
plenty
of
vintners
'
pots
.
<EOS>
His
father
kept
a
good
house
for
honest
men
,
his
tenants
that
brought
him
in
part
;
and
his
son
keeps
a
bad
house
with
knaves
that
help
to
consume
all
:
'
tis
but
the
change
of
time
:
why
should
any
man
repine
at
it
?

Crickets

SIR
REGINALD
died
,
leaving
issue
three
children
:
a
daughter
,
the
before
-
mentioned
Eleanor
—
who
,
entirely
discountenanced
by
the
family
,
had
been
seemingly
forgotten
by
all
but
her
father
—
,
and
two
sons
by
his
third
wife
.
<EOS>
Reginald
,
the
eldest
,
whose
military
taste
had
early
procured
him
the
command
of
a
company
of
horse
,
and
whose
politics
did
not
coalesce
with
those
of
his
sire
,
fell
,
during
his
father
's
lifetime
,
at
Killiecrankie
,
under
the
banners
of
William
.
<EOS>
Piers
,
therefore
,
the
second
son
,
succeeded
to
the
title
.
<EOS>
A
very
different
character
,
in
many
respects
,
from
his
father
and
brother
,
holding
in
supreme
dislike
courts
and
courtiers
,
party
warfare
,
political
intrigue
,
and
all
the
subtleties
of
Jesuitical
diplomacy
,
neither
having
any
inordinate
relish
for
camps
or
campaigns
,
Sir
Piers
Rookwood
yet
displayed
in
early
life
one
family
propensity
,
viz
.
,
unremitting
devotion
to
the
sex
.
<EOS>
Among
his
other
mistresses
was
the
unfortunate
Susan
Bradley
,
in
whom
by
some
he
was
supposed
to
have
been
clandestinely
united
.
<EOS>
In
early
youth
,
as
has
been
stated
,
Sir
Piers
professed
the
faith
of
Rome
,
but
shortly
after
the
death
of
his
beautiful
mistress
—
or
wife
,
as
it
might
be
—
,
having
quarreled
with
his
father
's
confessor
,
Checkley
,
he
publicly
abjured
his
heresies
.
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
subsequently
allied
himself
to
Maud
,
only
daughter
of
Sir
Thomas
D'Aubeny
,
the
last
of
a
line
as
proud
and
intolerant
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
The
tables
were
then
turned
.
<EOS>
Lady
Rookwood
usurped
sovereign
sway
over
her
lord
and
Sir
Piers
,
a
cipher
in
his
own
house
,
scarce
master
of
himself
,
much
less
of
his
dame
,
endured
an
existence
so
miserable
,
that
he
was
often
heard
to
regret
,
in
his
cups
,
that
he
had
not
inherited
,
with
the
estate
of
his
forefathers
,
the
family
secret
of
shaking
off
the
matrimonial
yoke
,
when
found
to
press
too
hardly
.
<EOS>
At
the
onset
,
Sir
Piers
struggled
hard
to
burst
his
bondage
.
<EOS>
But
in
vain
—
he
was
fast
fettered
;
and
only
bruised
himself
,
like
the
caged
lark
,
against
the
bars
of
his
prison
-
house
.
<EOS>
Abandoning
all
further
effort
at
emancipation
,
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
usual
resource
of
a
weak
mind
,
debauchery
;
and
drank
so
deeply
to
drown
his
cares
,
that
,
in
the
end
,
his
hale
constitution
yielded
to
his
excesses
.
<EOS>
It
was
even
said
,
that
remorse
at
his
abandonment
of
the
faith
of
his
fathers
had
some
share
in
his
misery
;
and
that
his
old
spiritual
,
and
if
report
spoke
truly
,
sinful
adviser
,
Father
Checkley
,
had
visited
him
secretly
at
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
was
observed
to
shudder
whenever
the
priest
's
name
was
mentioned
.
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
Rookwood
was
a
good
-
humored
man
in
the
main
,
had
little
of
the
old
family
leaven
about
him
,
and
was
esteemed
by
his
associates
.
<EOS>
Of
late
,
however
,
his
temper
became
soured
,
and
his
friends
deserted
him
;
for
,
between
his
domestic
annoyances
,
remorseful
feelings
,
and
the
inroads
already
made
upon
his
constitution
by
constant
inebriety
,
he
grew
so
desperate
and
insane
in
his
revels
,
and
committed
such
fearful
extravagances
,
that
even
his
boon
companions
shrank
from
his
orgies
.
<EOS>
Fearful
were
the
scenes
between
him
and
Lady
Rookwood
upon
these
occasions
—
appalling
to
the
witnesses
,
dreadful
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
,
perhaps
,
their
frequent
recurrence
,
that
,
more
than
anything
else
,
banished
all
decent
society
from
the
hall
.
<EOS>
At
the
time
of
Sir
Piers
's
decease
,
which
brings
us
down
to
the
date
of
our
story
,
his
son
and
successor
,
Ranulph
,
was
absent
on
his
travels
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
the
completion
of
his
academical
education
,
he
had
departed
to
make
the
tour
of
the
Continent
,
and
had
been
absent
rather
better
than
a
year
.
<EOS>
He
had
quitted
his
father
in
displeasure
,
and
was
destined
never
again
to
see
his
face
while
living
.
<EOS>
The
last
intelligence
received
of
young
Rookwood
was
from
Bordeaux
,
whence
<EOS>
it
was
thought
he
had
departed
for
the
Pyrenees
.
<EOS>
A
special
messenger
had
been
despatched
in
search
of
him
,
with
tidings
of
the
melancholy
event
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
it
was
deemed
improbable
by
Lady
Rookwood
that
her
son
could
return
within
any
reasonable
space
,
she
gave
directions
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
funeral
rites
of
her
husband
on
the
sixth
night
after
his
decease
—
it
being
the
custom
of
the
Rookwoods
ever
to
inter
their
dead
at
midnight,—intrusting
their
solemnization
entirely
to
the
care
of
one
of
Sir
Piers
's
hangers
-
on
—
Dr
.
<EOS>
Titus
Tyrconnel,—for
which
she
was
greatly
scandalized
in
the
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
Rookwood
was
a
youth
of
goodly
promise
.
<EOS>
The
stock
from
which
he
sprang
<EOS>
would
on
neither
side
warrant
such
conclusion
.
<EOS>
But
it
sometimes
happens
that
from
the
darkest
elements
are
compounded
the
brightest
and
subtlest
substances
;
and
so
it
occurred
in
this
instance
.
<EOS>
Fair
,
frank
,
and
free
—
generous
,
open
,
unsuspicious
<EOS>
—
he
seemed
the
very
opposite
of
all
his
race
—
their
antagonizing
principle
.
<EOS>
Capriciously
indulgent
,
his
father
had
allowed
him
ample
means
,
neither
curbing
nor
restraining
his
expenditure
;
acceding
at
one
moment
to
every
inclination
,
and
the
next
irresolutely
opposing
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
,
therefore
,
for
him
,
in
such
a
state
of
things
,
to
act
decidedly
,
without
incurring
his
father
's
displeasure
;
and
the
only
measure
he
resolved
upon
,
which
was
to
absent
himself
for
a
time
,
was
conjectured
to
have
brought
about
the
result
he
had
endeavored
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
Other
reasons
,
however
,
there
were
,
which
secretly
influenced
him
,
which
it
will
be
our
business
in
due
time
to
detail
.

<EOS>
THE
time
of
the
sad
ceremonial
drew
nigh
.
<EOS>
The
hurrying
of
the
domestics
to
and
fro
;
the
multifarious
arrangements
for
the
night
;
the
distribution
of
the
melancholy
trappings
,
and
the
discussion
of
the
"
funeral
-
baked
meats
,
"
furnished
abundant
occupation
within
doors
.
<EOS>
Without
,
there
was
a
constant
stream
of
the
tenantry
,
thronging
down
the
avenue
,
mixed
with
an
occasional
horseman
,
once
or
twice
intercepted
by
a
large
lumbering
carriage
,
bringing
friends
of
the
deceased
,
some
really
anxious
to
pay
the
last
tribute
of
regard
,
but
the
majority
attracted
by
the
anticipated
spectacle
of
a
funeral
by
torchlight
.
<EOS>
There
were
others
,
indeed
,
to
whom
it
was
not
matter
of
choice
;
who
were
compelled
,
by
a
vassal
tenure
of
their
lands
,
held
of
the
house
of
Rookwood
,
to
lend
a
shoulder
to
the
coffin
,
and
a
hand
to
the
torch
,
on
the
burial
of
its
lord
.
<EOS>
Of
these
there
was
a
plentiful
muster
collected
in
the
hall
;
they
were
to
be
marshalled
by
Peter
Bradley
,
who
was
deemed
to
be
well
skilled
in
the
proceedings
,
having
been
present
at
two
solemnities
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
That
mysterious
personage
,
however
,
had
not
made
his
appearance
—
to
the
great
dismay
of
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
Scouts
were
sent
in
search
of
him
,
but
they
returned
with
the
intelligence
that
the
door
of
his
habitation
was
fastened
,
and
its
inmate
apparently
absent
.
<EOS>
No
other
tidings
of
the
truant
sexton
could
be
obtained
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
sultry
August
evening
.
<EOS>
No
breeze
was
stirring
in
the
garden
;
no
cool
dews
refreshed
the
parched
and
heated
earth
;
yet
from
the
languishing
flowers
rich
sweets
exhaled
.
<EOS>
The
plash
of
a
fountain
fell
pleasantly
upon
the
ear
,
conveying
in
its
sound
a
sense
of
freshness
to
the
fervid
air
;
while
deep
and
drowsy
murmurs
hummed
heavily
beneath
the
trees
,
making
the
twilight
slumberously
musical
.
<EOS>
The
westering
sun
,
which
filled
the
atmosphere
with
flame
throughout
the
day
,
was
now
wildly
setting
;
and
,
as
he
sank
behind
the
hall
,
its
varied
and
picturesque
tracery
became
each
instant
more
darkly
and
distinctly
defined
against
the
crimson
sky
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
a
little
gate
,
communicating
with
the
chase
,
was
thrown
open
,
and
a
young
man
entered
the
garden
,
passing
through
the
shrubbery
,
and
hurrying
rapidly
forward
till
he
arrived
at
a
vista
opening
upon
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
spot
at
which
the
stranger
halted
was
marked
by
a
little
basin
,
scantily
supplied
with
water
,
streaming
from
a
lion
's
kingly
jaws
.
<EOS>
His
dress
was
travel
-
soiled
,
and
dusty
;
and
his
whole
appearance
betokened
great
exhaustion
from
heat
and
fatigue
.
<EOS>
Seating
himself
upon
an
adjoining
bench
,
he
threw
off
his
riding
-
cap
,
and
unclasped
his
collar
,
displaying
a
finely
-
turned
head
and
neck
;
and
a
countenance
which
,
besides
its
beauty
,
had
that
rare
nobility
of
feature
which
seldom
falls
to
the
lot
of
the
aristocrat
,
but
is
never
seen
in
one
of
an
inferior
order
.
<EOS>
A
restless
disquietude
of
manner
showed
that
he
was
suffering
from
over
-
excitement
of
mind
,
as
well
as
from
bodily
exertion
.
<EOS>
His
look
was
wild
and
hurried
;
his
black
ringlets
were
dashed
heedlessly
over
a
pallid
,
lofty
brow
,
upon
which
care
was
prematurely
written
;
while
his
large
melancholy
eyes
were
bent
,
with
a
look
almost
of
agony
,
upon
the
house
before
him
.
<EOS>
After
a
short
pause
,
and
as
if
struggling
against
violent
emotions
,
and
some
overwhelming
remembrance
,
the
youth
arose
,
and
plunged
his
hand
into
the
basin
,
applying
the
moist
element
to
his
burning
brow
.
<EOS>
Apparently
becoming
more
calm
,
he
bent
his
steps
towards
the
hall
,
when
two
figures
,
suddenly
issuing
from
an
adjoining
copse
,
arrested
his
progress
;
neither
saw
him
.
<EOS>
Muttering
a
hurried
farewell
,
<EOS>
one
of
the
figures
disappeared
within
the
shrubbery
,
and
the
other
,
confronting
the
stranger
,
displayed
the
harsh
features
and
gaunt
form
of
Peter
Bradley
.
<EOS>
Had
Peter
encountered
the
dead
Sir
Piers
in
corporeal
form
,
he
could
not
have
manifested
more
surprise
than
he
exhibited
,
for
an
instant
or
two
,
as
he
shrunk
back
from
the
stranger
's
path
.

<EOS>
AN
hour
or
two
prior
to
the
incident
just
narrated
,
in
a
small
,
cosy
apartment
of
the
hall
,
nominally
devoted
to
justiciary
business
by
its
late
owner
,
but
,
in
reality
,
used
as
a
sanctum
,
snuggery
,
or
smoking
-
room
,
a
singular
trio
were
assembled
,
fraught
with
the
ulterior
purpose
of
attending
the
obsequies
of
their
deceased
patron
and
friend
,
though
immediately
occupied
in
the
discussion
of
a
magnum
of
excellent
claret
,
the
bouquet
of
which
perfumed
the
air
,
like
the
fragrance
of
a
bed
of
violets
.
<EOS>
This
little
room
had
been
poor
Sir
Piers
's
favorite
retreat
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
in
fact
,
the
only
room
in
the
house
that
he
could
call
his
own
;
and
thither
<EOS>
would
he
often
,
with
pipe
and
punch
,
beguile
the
flagging
hours
,
secure
from
interruption
.
<EOS>
A
snug
,
old
-
fashioned
apartment
it
was
;
wainscoted
with
rich
black
oak
;
with
a
fine
old
cabinet
of
the
same
material
,
and
a
line
or
two
of
crazy
,
worm
-
eaten
bookshelves
,
laden
with
sundry
dusty
,
unconsulted
law
tomes
,
and
a
light
sprinkling
of
the
elder
divines
,
equally
neglected
.
<EOS>
The
only
book
,
indeed
,
Sir
Piers
ever
read
,
was
the
"
Anatomie
of
Melancholy
;
"
and
he
merely
studied
Burton
because
the
quaint
,
racy
style
of
the
learned
old
hypochondriac
suited
his
humor
at
seasons
,
and
gave
a
zest
to
his
sorrows
,
such
as
the
olives
lent
to
his
wine
.
<EOS>
Four
portraits
adorned
the
walls
:
those
of
Sir
Reginald
Rookwood
and
his
wives
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
were
attired
in
the
flowing
drapery
of
Charles
the
Second
's
day
,
the
snow
of
their
radiant
bosoms
being
somewhat
sullied
by
over
-
exposure
,
and
the
vermeil
tinting
of
their
cheeks
darkened
by
the
fumes
of
tobacco
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
shepherdess
,
with
her
taper
crook
,
whose
large
,
languishing
eyes
,
ripe
pouting
lips
,
ready
to
melt
into
kisses
,
and
air
of
voluptuous
abandonment
,
scarcely
suited
the
innocent
simplicity
of
her
costume
.
<EOS>
She
was
portrayed
tending
a
flock
of
downy
sheep
,
with
azure
ribbons
round
their
necks
,
accompanied
by
one
of
those
invaluable
little
dogs
whose
length
of
ear
and
silkiness
of
skin
evinced
him
perfect
in
his
breeding
,
but
whose
large
-
eyed
indifference
to
his
charge
proved
him
to
be
as
much
out
of
character
with
his
situation
as
the
refined
and
luxuriant
charms
of
his
mistress
were
out
of
keeping
with
her
artless
attire
.
<EOS>
This
was
Sir
Piers
's
mother
,
the
third
wife
,
a
beautiful
woman
,
answering
to
the
notion
of
one
who
had
been
somewhat
of
a
flirt
in
her
day
.
<EOS>
Next
to
her
was
a
magnificent
dame
,
with
the
throat
and
arm
of
a
Juno
,
and
a
superb
bust
—
the
bust
was
then
what
the
bustle
is
now
—
a
paramount
attraction
;
whether
the
modification
be
an
improvement
,
we
leave
to
the
consideration
of
the
lovers
of
the
beautiful
—
this
was
the
dowager
.
<EOS>
Lastly
,
there
was
the
lovely
and
ill
-
fated
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
Every
gentle
grace
belonging
to
this
unfortunate
lady
had
been
stamped
in
undying
beauty
on
the
canvas
by
the
hand
of
Lely
,
breathing
a
spell
on
the
picture
,
almost
as
powerful
as
that
which
had
dwelt
around
the
exquisite
original
.
<EOS>
Over
the
high
carved
mantelpiece
was
suspended
the
portrait
of
Sir
Reginald
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
painted
in
early
youth
;
the
features
were
beautiful
,
disdainful,—with
a
fierceness
breaking
through
the
courtly
air
.
<EOS>
The
eyes
were
very
fine
,
black
as
midnight
,
and
piercing
as
those
of
Cæsar
Borgia
,
as
seen
in
Raphael
's
wonderful
picture
in
the
Borghese
Palace
at
Rome
.
<EOS>
They
seemed
to
fascinate
the
gazer
—
to
rivet
his
glances
—
to
follow
him
whithersoever
<EOS>
he
went
—
and
to
search
into
his
soul
,
as
did
the
dark
orbs
of
Sir
Reginald
in
his
lifetime
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
work
likewise
of
Lely
,
and
had
all
the
fidelity
and
graceful
refinement
of
that
great
master
;
nor
was
the
haughty
countenance
of
Sir
Reginald
<EOS>
unworthy
the
patrician
painter
.
<EOS>
No
portrait
of
Sir
Piers
was
to
be
met
with
.
<EOS>
But
in
lieu
thereof
,
depending
from
a
pair
of
buck
's
horns
,
hung
the
worthy
knight
's
stained
scarlet
coat
—
the
same
in
which
he
had
ridden
forth
,
with
the
intent
to
hunt
,
on
the
eventful
occasion
detailed
by
Peter
Bradley,—his
velvet
cap
,
his
buck
-
handled
whip
,
and
the
residue
of
his
equipment
for
the
chase
.
<EOS>
This
attire
was
reviewed
with
melancholy
interest
and
unaffected
emotion
by
the
company
,
as
reminding
them
forcibly
of
the
departed
,
of
which
it
seemed
a
portion
.
<EOS>
The
party
consisted
of
the
vicar
of
Rookwood
,
Dr.
Polycarp
Small
;
Dr.
Titus
Tyrconnel
,
an
emigrant
,
and
empirical
professor
of
medicine
,
from
the
sister
isle
,
whose
convivial
habits
had
first
introduced
him
to
the
hall
,
and
afterwards
retained
him
there
;
and
Mr.
Codicil
Coates
,
clerk
of
the
peace
,
attorney
-
at
-
law
,
bailiff
,
and
receiver
.
<EOS>
We
were
wrong
in
saying
that
Tyrconnel
was
retained
.
<EOS>
He
was
an
impudent
,
intrusive
fellow
,
whom
,
having
once
gained
a
footing
in
the
house
,
it
was
impossible
to
dislodge
.
<EOS>
He
cared
for
no
insult
;
perceived
no
slight
;
and
professed
,
in
her
presence
,
the
profoundest
respect
for
Lady
Rookwood
:
in
short
,
he
was
ever
ready
to
do
anything
but
depart
.
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
was
one
of
those
people
who
can
not
dine
alone
.
<EOS>
He
disliked
a
solitary
repast
almost
as
much
as
a
tête
-
à
-
tête
with
his
lady
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
been
recognized
at
once
as
the
true
Amphitryon
,
had
any
one
been
hardy
enough
to
play
the
part
of
Jupiter
.
<EOS>
Ever
ready
to
give
a
dinner
,
he
found
a
difficulty
arise
,
not
usually
experienced
on
such
occasions
—
there
was
no
one
upon
whom
to
bestow
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
best
of
wine
;
kept
an
excellent
table
;
was
himself
no
niggard
host
;
but
his
own
merits
,
and
those
of
his
cuisine
,
were
forgotten
in
the
invariable
pendant
to
the
feast
;
and
the
best
of
wine
lost
its
flavor
when
the
last
bottle
found
its
way
to
the
guest
's
head
.
<EOS>
Dine
alone
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
would
not
.
<EOS>
And
as
his
old
friends
forsook
him
,
he
plunged
lower
in
his
search
of
society
;
collecting
within
his
house
a
class
of
persons
whom
no
one
would
have
expected
to
meet
at
the
hall
,
nor
even
its
owner
have
chosen
for
his
companions
,
had
any
choice
remained
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
endure
this
state
of
things
without
much
outward
show
of
discontent
.
<EOS>
"
Anything
for
a
quiet
life
,
"
was
his
constant
saying
;
and
,
like
the
generality
of
people
with
whom
those
words
form
a
favorite
maxim
,
he
led
the
most
uneasy
life
imaginable
.
<EOS>
Endurance
,
to
excite
commiseration
,
must
be
uncomplaining
—
an
axiom
the
aggrieved
of
the
gentle
sex
should
remember
.
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
endured
,
but
he
grumbled
lustily
,
and
was
on
all
hands
voted
a
bore
;
domestic
grievances
,
especially
if
the
husband
be
the
plaintiff
,
being
the
most
intolerable
of
all
mentionable
miseries
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
that
his
friends
deserted
him
;
still
there
was
Titus
Tyrconnel
;
his
ears
and
lips
were
ever
open
to
pathos
and
to
punch
;
so
Titus
kept
his
station
.
<EOS>
Immediately
after
her
husband
's
demise
,
it
had
been
Lady
Rookwood
's
intention
to
clear
the
house
of
all
the
"
vermin
,
"
<EOS>
so
she
expressed
herself
,
that
had
so
long
infested
it
;
and
forcibly
to
eject
Titus
,
and
one
or
two
other
intruders
of
the
same
class
.
<EOS>
But
in
consequence
of
certain
hints
received
from
Mr.
Coates
,
who
represented
the
absolute
necessity
of
complying
with
Sir
Piers
's
testamentary
instructions
,
which
were
particular
in
that
respect
,
she
thought
proper
to
defer
her
intentions
until
after
the
ceremonial
of
interment
should
be
completed
,
and
,
in
the
mean
time
,
strange
to
say
,
committed
its
arrangement
to
Titus
Tyrconnel
;
who
,
ever
ready
to
accommodate
,
accepted
,
nothing
loth
,
the
charge
,
and
acquitted
himself
admirably
well
in
his
undertaking
:
especially
,
as
he
said
,
"
in
the
aiting
and
drinking
department
—
the
most
essential
part
of
it
all
.
"
<EOS>
He
kept
open
house
—
open
dining
-
room
—
open
cellar
;
resolved
that
his
patron
's
funeral
should
emulate
as
much
as
possible
an
Irish
burial
on
a
grand
scale
,
"
the
finest
sight
,
"
in
his
opinion
,
"
in
the
whole
world
.
<EOS>
"Inflated
<EOS>
with
the
importance
of
his
office
,
inflamed
with
heat
,
sat
Titus
,
like
a
"
robustious
periwig
-
pated
"
alderman
after
a
civic
feast
.
<EOS>
The
natural
rubicundity
of
his
countenance
was
darkened
to
a
deep
purple
tint
,
like
that
of
a
full
-
blown
peony
,
while
his
ludicrous
dignity
was
augmented
by
a
shining
suit
of
sables
,
in
which
his
portly
person
was
invested
.
<EOS>
The
first
magnum
had
been
discussed
in
solemn
silence
;
the
cloud
,
however
,
which
hung
over
the
conclave
,
disappeared
under
the
genial
influence
of
"
another
and
a
better
"
bottle
,
and
gave
place
to
a
denser
vapor
,
occasioned
by
the
introduction
of
the
pipe
and
its
accompaniments
.
<EOS>
Ensconced
in
a
comfortable
old
chair
—
it
is
not
every
old
chair
that
is
comfortable,—with
pipe
in
mouth
,
and
in
full
unbuttoned
ease
,
his
bushy
cauliflower
wig
laid
aside
,
by
reason
of
the
heat
,
reposed
Dr.
Small
.
<EOS>
Small
,
indeed
,
was
somewhat
of
a
misnomer
,
as
applied
to
the
worthy
doctor
,
who
,
besides
being
no
diminutive
specimen
of
his
kind
,
entertained
no
insignificant
opinion
of
himself
.
<EOS>
His
height
was
certainly
not
remarkable
;
but
his
width
of
shoulder
—
his
sesquipedality
of
stomach
—
and
obesity
of
calf
—
these
were
unique
!
<EOS>
Of
his
origin
we
know
nothing
;
but
presume
he
must
,
in
some
way
or
other
,
have
been
connected
with
the
numerous
family
of
"
the
Smalls
,
"
who
,
according
to
Christopher
North
,
form
the
predominant
portion
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
In
appearance
,
the
doctor
was
short
-
necked
and
puffy
,
with
a
sodden
,
pasty
face
,
wherein
were
set
eyes
whose
obliquity
of
vision
was
,
in
some
measure
,
redeemed
by
their
expression
of
humor
.
<EOS>
He
was
accounted
a
man
of
parts
and
erudition
,
and
had
obtained
high
honors
at
his
university
.
<EOS>
Rigidly
orthodox
,
he
abominated
the
very
names
of
Papists
and
Jacobites
,
amongst
which
heretical
herd
<EOS>
he
classed
his
companion
,
Mr.
Titus
Tyrconnel
—
<EOS>
Ireland
being
with
him
synonymous
with
superstition
and
Catholicism
—
and
every
Irishman
rebellious
and
schismatical
.
<EOS>
On
this
head
he
was
inclined
to
be
disputatious
.
<EOS>
His
prejudices
did
not
prevent
him
from
passing
the
claret
,
nor
from
laughing
,
as
heartily
as
a
plethoric
asthma
and
sense
of
the
decorum
due
to
the
occasion
would
permit
,
at
the
quips
and
quirks
of
the
Irishman
,
who
,
he
admitted
,
notwithstanding
his
heresies
,
was
a
pleasant
fellow
in
the
main
.
<EOS>
And
when
,
in
addition
to
the
flattery
,
a
pipe
had
been
insinuated
by
the
officious
Titus
,
at
the
precise
moment
that
Small
yearned
for
his
afternoon
's
solace
,
yet
scrupled
to
ask
for
it
;
when
the
door
had
been
made
fast
,
and
the
first
whiff
exhaled
,
all
his
misgivings
vanished
,
and
he
surrendered
himself
to
the
soft
seduction
.
<EOS>
In
this
Elysian
state
we
find
him
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
you
may
say
that
,
Dr.
Small
,
"
said
Titus
,
in
answer
to
some
observation
of
the
vicar
,
"
that
's
a
most
original
apothegm
.
<EOS>
We
all
of
us
hould
our
lives
by
a
thrid
.
<EOS>
Och
!
<EOS>
many
's
the
sudden
finale
I
have
seen
.
<EOS>
Many
's
the
fine
fellow
's
heels
tripped
up
unawares
,
when
least
expected
.
<EOS>
Death
hangs
over
our
heads
by
a
single
hair
,
as
your
reverence
says
,
precisely
like
the
sword
of
Dan
Maclise,[6
]
<EOS>
the
flatterer
of
Dinnish
what
-
do
-
you
<EOS>
-
call
-
him
,
ready
to
fall
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
or
no
notice
at
all
—
eh?—Mr
.
<EOS>
Coates
.
<EOS>
And
that
brings
me
back
again
to
Sir
Piers
—
poor
gentleman
—
ah
!
<EOS>
we
sha'n't
soon
see
the
like
of
him
<EOS>
again!""Poor
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
!
"
said
Mr.
Coates
,
a
small
man
,
in
a
scratch
wig
,
with
a
face
red
and
round
as
an
apple
,
and
almost
as
diminutive
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
to
be
regretted
that
his
over
-
conviviality
should
so
much
have
hastened
his
lamented
demise
.
""Conviviality
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Titus
;
"
no
such
thing
<EOS>
—
it
was
apoplexy
—
extravasation
of
sarum
.
<EOS>
""Extra
<EOS>
vase
-
ation
of
rum
and
water
,
you
mean
,
"
replied
Coates
,
who
,
like
all
his
tribe
,
rejoiced
in
a
quibble
.
"The
<EOS>
squire
's
ailment
,
"
continued
Titus
,
"
was
a
sanguineous
effusion
,
as
we
call
it
—
positive
determination
of
blood
to
the
head
,
occasioned
by
a
low
way
he
got
into
,
just
before
his
attack
—
a
confirmed
case
of
hypochondriasis
,
as
that
ould
book
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
was
so
fond
of
terms
the
blue
devils
.
<EOS>
He
neglected
the
bottle
,
which
,
in
a
man
who
has
been
a
hard
drinker
all
his
life
,
is
a
bad
sign
.
<EOS>
The
lowering
system
never
answers
—
never
.
<EOS>
Doctor
,
I
'll
just
trouble
you"—for
Small
,
in
a
fit
of
absence
,
had
omitted
to
pass
the
bottle
,
though
not
to
help
himself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Had
he
stuck
to
this"—holding
up
a
glass
,
ruby
bright—"the
elixir
vitæ
—
the
grand
panacea
<EOS>
—
he
might
have
been
hale
and
hearty
at
this
present
moment
,
and
as
well
as
any
of
us
.
<EOS>
But
he
would
n't
be
advised
.
<EOS>
To
my
thinking
,
as
that
was
the
case
,
he
'd
have
been
all
the
better
for
a
little
of
your
reverence
's
sperretual
advice
;
and
his
conscience
having
been
relieved
by
confession
and
absolution
,
he
might
have
opened
a
fresh
account
with
an
aisy
heart
and
clane
breast
.
<EOS>
""I
trust
,
sir
,
"
said
<EOS>
Small
,
gravely
withdrawing
his
pipe
from
his
lips
,
"
that
Sir
Piers
Rookwood
addressed
himself
to
a
higher
source
than
a
sinning
creature
of
clay
like
himself
for
remission
of
his
sins
;
but
,
<EOS>
if
there
was
any
load
of
secret
guilt
that
might
have
weighed
heavy
upon
his
conscience
,
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
he
refused
the
last
offices
of
the
church
,
and
died
incommunicate
.
<EOS>
I
was
denied
all
admittance
to
his
chamber
.
<EOS>
""Exactly
<EOS>
my
case
,
"
said
Mr.
Coates
,
pettishly
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
refused
entrance
,
though
my
business
was
of
the
utmost
importance
—
certain
dispositions
—
special
bequests
—
matter
connected
with
his
sister
—
for
though
the
estate
is
entailed
,
yet
still
there
are
charges
—
you
understand
me
—
very
strange
to
refuse
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
Some
people
may
regret
it
—
may
live
to
regret
it
,
I
say
—
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
I
've
just
sent
up
a
package
to
Lady
Rookwood
,
which
was
not
to
be
delivered
till
after
Sir
Piers
's
death
.
<EOS>
Odd
circumstance
that
—
been
in
my
custody
a
long
while
—
some
reason
to
think
Sir
Piers
meant
to
alter
his
will
—
ought
to
have
seen
me
—
sad
<EOS>
neglect!""More
's
the
pity
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
none
of
poor
Sir
Piers
's
doing
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Titus
;
"
he
had
no
will
of
his
own
,
poor
fellow
,
during
his
life
,
and
the
devil
a
will
was
he
likely
to
have
after
his
death
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
Lady
Rookwood
's
doing
,
"
added
he
,
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
I
,
his
medical
adviser
and
confidential
friend
,
was
ordered
out
of
the
room
;
and
,
although
I
knew
it
was
as
much
as
his
life
was
worth
to
leave
him
for
a
moment
in
that
state
,
I
was
forced
to
comply
:
and
,
would
you
believe
it
,
as
I
left
the
room
,
I
heard
high
words
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
doctor
,
as
I
hope
to
be
saved
,
words
of
anger
from
her
at
that
awful
juncture
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
latter
part
of
this
speech
was
uttered
in
a
low
tone
,
and
very
mysterious
manner
.
<EOS>
The
speakers
drew
so
closely
together
,
that
the
bowls
of
their
pipes
formed
a
common
centre
,
whence
the
stems
radiated
.
<EOS>
A
momentary
silence
ensued
,
during
which
each
man
puffed
for
very
life
.
<EOS>
Small
next
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
tube
,
and
began
to
replenish
it
,
coughing
significantly
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Coates
expelled
a
thin
,
curling
stream
of
vapor
from
a
minute
orifice
in
the
corner
of
his
almost
invisible
mouth
,
and
arched
his
eyebrows
in
a
singular
manner
,
as
if
he
dared
not
trust
the
expression
of
his
thoughts
to
any
other
feature
.
<EOS>
Titus
shook
his
huge
head
,
and
,
upon
the
strength
of
a
bumper
which
he
swallowed
,
mustered
resolution
enough
to
unburden
his
bosom
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
my
sowl
,
"
said
he
,
mysteriously
,
"
I
've
seen
enough
lately
to
frighten
any
quiet
gentleman
out
of
his
senses
.
<EOS>
I
'll
not
get
a
wink
of
sleep
,
I
fear
,
for
a
week
to
come
.
<EOS>
There
must
have
been
something
dreadful
upon
Sir
Piers
's
mind
;
sure
—
nay
<EOS>
,
there
's
no
use
in
mincing
the
matter
with
you
—
in
a
word
,
then
,
some
crime
too
deep
to
be
divulged
.
<EOS>
""Crime
!
"
echoed
Coates
and
Small
,
in
a
breath
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
crime
!
"
repeated
Titus
.
"
<EOS>
Whist
!
<EOS>
not
so
loud
,
lest
any
one
should
overhear
us
.
<EOS>
Poor
Sir
Piers
,
he
's
dead
now
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
you
both
loved
him
as
I
did
,
and
pity
and
pardon
him
if
he
was
guilty
;
for
certain
am
I
that
no
soul
ever
took
its
flight
more
heavily
laden
than
did
that
of
our
poor
friend
.
<EOS>
Och
!
<EOS>
it
was
a
terrible
ending
.
<EOS>
But
you
shall
hear
how
he
died
,
and
judge
for
yourselves
.
<EOS>
When
I
returned
to
his
room
after
Lady
Rookwood
's
departure
,
I
found
him
quite
delirious
.
<EOS>
I
knew
death
was
not
far
off
then
.
<EOS>
One
minute
he
was
in
the
chase
,
cheering
on
the
hounds
.
'
<EOS>
Halloo
!
tallyho
!
'
<EOS>
cried
he
:
'
who
clears
that
fence?—who
swims
that
stream
?
'
<EOS>
The
next
,
he
was
drinking
,
carousing
,
and
hurrahing
,
at
the
head
of
his
table
.
'
<EOS>
Hip
!
hip
!
<EOS>
hip!'—as
mad
,
and
wild
,
and
frantic
as
ever
he
used
to
be
when
wine
had
got
the
better
of
him
;
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
,
in
the
midst
of
his
shouting
,
he
stopped
,
exclaiming
,
'
What
!
<EOS>
here
again?—who
let
her
in?—the
door
is
fast

I
locked
it
myself

<EOS>
why
did
you
open
it?—you
<EOS>
have
betrayed
me

she
will
poison
me

I
can
not
resist

<EOS>
Ha

another

<EOS>
Who
—
who
is
that?—her
<EOS>
face
is
white

about
her
shoulders

Is
she
alive
again

<EOS>
why
that
look

loved
me
well

too
well

You

not

me
to
perdition

<EOS>
You
will
not
appear
against
me

<EOS>
No

no

no

you

I
doted
on

I
repented

sorrowed

no
prayers
would
avail

Pray
for
me

for
ever

Your
intercession
may
avail

<EOS>
It
is
not
too
late

I
will
do
justice
to
all
.
<EOS>
Bring
me
pen
and
ink
<EOS>
—
paper
—
I
will
confess
—
he
shall
have
all
.
<EOS>
Where
is
my
sister
?
<EOS>
I
would
speak
with
her
—
would
tell
her
—
tell
her
.
<EOS>
Call
Alan
Rookwood
<EOS>
—
I
shall
die
before
I
can
tell
it

Come
hither

said
he
to
me
.
'
<EOS>
There
is
a
dark
,
dreadful
secret
on
my
mind
—
it
must
forth
.
<EOS>
Tell
my
sister
—
no
,
my
senses
swim
—
Susan
is
near
me
—
fury
in
her
eyes
—
<EOS>
avenging
fury
—
keep
her
off
.
<EOS>
What
is
this
white
mass
in
my
arms
?
<EOS>
what
do
I
hold
?
<EOS>
is
it
the
corpse
by
my
side
,
as
it
lay
that
long
,
long
night
?
<EOS>
It
is
—
it
is

<EOS>
Cold
,
stiff
,
stirless
as
then
.
<EOS>
White
—
horribly
white
—
as
when
the
moon
,
that
would
not
set
,
showed
all
its
ghastliness
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
it
moves
,
embraces
me
,
stifles
,
suffocates
me
.
<EOS>
Help
!
<EOS>
remove
the
pillow
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
breathe
—
I
choke
—
oh
!
'
<EOS>
And
now
I
am
coming
to
the
strangest
part
of
my
story
—
and
,
strange
as
it
may
sound
,
every
word
is
as
true
as
Gospel
.
<EOS>
""Ahem
!
"
coughed
Small
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
at
this
moment
—
this
terrible
moment
—
what
should
I
hear
but
a
tap
against
the
wainscot
.
<EOS>
Holy
Virgin
!
<EOS>
how
it
startled
me
.
<EOS>
My
heart
leapt
to
my
mouth
in
an
instant
,
and
then
went
thump
,
thump
,
against
my
ribs
.
<EOS>
But
I
said
nothing
,
though
you
may
be
sure
I
kept
my
ears
wide
open
—
and
then
presently
I
heard
the
tap
repeated
somewhat
louder
,
and
shortly
afterwards
a
third
—
I
should
still
have
said
nothing
,
but
Sir
Piers
heard
the
knock
,
and
raised
himself
at
the
summons
,
as
if
it
had
been
the
last
trumpet
.
'
<EOS>
Come
in
,
'
cried
he
,
in
a
dying
voice
;
and
Heaven
forgive
me
if
I
confess
that
I
expected
a
certain
person
,
whose
company
one
would
rather
dispense
with
upon
such
an
occasion
,
to
step
in
.
<EOS>
However
,
though
it
was
n't
the
ould
gentleman
,
it
was
somebody
near
akin
to
him
;
for
a
door
I
had
never
seen
,
and
never
even
dreamed
of
,
opened
in
the
wall
,
and
in
stepped
Peter
Bradley
—
ay
,
you
may
well
stare
,
gentlemen
;
but
it
was
Peter
,
looking
as
stiff
as
a
crowbar
,
and
as
blue
as
a
mattock
.
<EOS>
Well
,
he
walked
straight
up
to
the
bed
of
the
dying
man
,
and
bent
his
great
,
diabolical
gray
eyes
upon
him
,
laughing
all
the
while
—
<EOS>
yes
,
laughing
—
you
know
the
cursed
grin
he
has
.
<EOS>
To
proceed
.
'
<EOS>
You
have
called
me
,
'
said
he
to
Sir
Piers
;
'
I
am
here
.
<EOS>
What
would
you
with
me?'—'We
are
not
alone
,
'
groaned
the
dying
man
.
'
<EOS>
Leave
us
,
Mr.
Tyrconnel
—
leave
me
for
five
minutes
—
only
five
,
mark
me
.
<EOS>
'—'I'll
go
,
'
thinks
I
,
'
but
I
shall
never
see
you
again
alive
.
'
<EOS>
And
true
enough
it
was
—
I
never
did
see
him
again
with
breath
in
his
body
.
<EOS>
Without
more
ado
,
I
left
him
,
and
I
had
scarcely
reached
the
corridor
when
I
heard
the
door
bolted
behind
me
.
<EOS>
I
then
stopped
to
listen
:
and
I
'm
sure
you
'll
not
blame
me
when
I
say
I
clapped
my
eye
to
the
keyhole
;
for
I
suspected
something
wrong
.
<EOS>
But
,
Heaven
save
us
!
<EOS>
that
crafty
gravedigger
had
taken
his
precautions
too
well
.
<EOS>
I
could
neither
see
nor
hear
anything
,
except
after
a
few
minutes
,
<EOS>
a
wild
unearthly
screech
.
<EOS>
And
then
the
door
was
thrown
open
,
and
I
,
not
expecting
it
,
was
precipitated
head
foremost
into
the
room
,
to
the
great
damage
of
my
nose
.
<EOS>
When
I
got
up
,
Peter
had
vanished
,
I
suppose
,
as
he
came
;
and
there
was
poor
Sir
Piers
leaning
back
upon
the
pillow
with
his
hands
stretched
out
as
if
in
supplication
,
his
eyes
unclosed
and
staring
,
and
his
limbs
stark
and
<EOS>
stiff!"A
profound
silence
succeeded
this
narrative
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Coates
would
not
venture
upon
a
remark
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Small
seemed
,
for
some
minutes
,
lost
in
painful
reflection
;
at
length
he
spoke
:
"
You
have
described
a
shocking
scene
,
Mr.
Tyrconnel
,
and
in
a
manner
that
convinces
me
of
its
fidelity
.
<EOS>
But
I
trust
you
will
excuse
me
,
as
a
friend
of
the
late
Sir
Piers
,
in
requesting
you
to
maintain
silence
in
future
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Its
repetition
can
be
productive
of
no
good
,
and
may
do
infinite
harm
by
giving
currency
to
unpleasant
reports
,
and
harrowing
the
feelings
of
the
survivors
.
<EOS>
Every
one
acquainted
with
Sir
Piers
's
history
must
be
aware
,
as
I
dare
say
you
are
already
,
of
an
occurrence
which
cast
a
shade
over
his
early
life
,
blighted
his
character
,
and
endangered
his
personal
safety
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
dreadful
accusation
.
<EOS>
But
I
believe
,
nay
,
I
am
sure
,
it
was
unfounded
.
<EOS>
Dark
suspicions
attach
to
a
Romish
priest
of
the
name
of
Checkley
.
<EOS>
He
,
I
believe
,
is
beyond
the
reach
of
human
justice
.
<EOS>
Erring
Sir
Piers
was
,
undoubtedly
.
<EOS>
But
I
trust
he
was
more
weak
than
sinful
.
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
think
he
was
the
tool
of
others
,
especially
of
the
wretch
I
have
named
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
easy
to
perceive
how
that
incomprehensible
lunatic
,
Peter
Bradley
,
has
obtained
an
ascendancy
over
him
.
<EOS>
His
daughter
,
you
are
aware
,
was
Sir
Piers
's
mistress
.
<EOS>
Our
friend
is
now
gone
,
and
with
him
let
us
bury
his
offences
,
and
the
remembrance
of
them
.
<EOS>
That
his
soul
was
heavily
laden
,
would
appear
from
your
account
of
his
last
moments
;
yet
I
fervently
trust
that
his
repentance
was
sincere
,
in
which
case
there
is
hope
of
forgiveness
for
him
.
'
<EOS>
At
what
time
soever
a
sinner
shall
repent
him
of
his
sins
,
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
,
I
will
blot
out
all
his
wickedness
out
of
my
remembrance
,
saith
the
Lord
.
'
<EOS>
Heaven
's
mercy
is
greater
than
man
's
sins
.
<EOS>
And
there
is
hope
of
salvation
even
for
Sir
Piers
.
<EOS>
""I
trust
<EOS>
so
,
indeed
,
"
said
Titus
,
with
emotion
;
"
and
as
to
repeating
a
syllable
of
what
I
have
just
said
,
devil
a
word
more
<EOS>
will
I
utter
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
My
lips
shall
be
shut
and
sealed
,
as
close
as
one
of
Mr.
Coates
's
bonds
,
for
ever
and
a
day
:
but
I
thought
it
just
right
to
make
you
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
having
dismissed
the
bad
for
ever
,
I
am
ready
to
speak
of
Sir
Piers
's
good
qualities
,
and
not
few
they
were
.
<EOS>
What
was
there
becoming
a
gentleman
that
he
could
n't
do
,
I
'd
like
to
know
?
<EOS>
Could
n't
he
hunt
as
well
as
ever
a
one
in
the
county
?
<EOS>
and
had
n't
he
as
good
a
pack
of
hounds
?
<EOS>
Could
n't
he
shoot
as
well
,
and
fish
as
well
,
and
drink
as
well
,
or
better?—only
<EOS>
he
could
n't
carry
his
wine
,
which
was
his
misfortune
,
not
his
fault
.
<EOS>
And
was
n't
he
always
ready
to
ask
a
friend
to
dinner
with
him
?
<EOS>
and
did
n't
he
give
him
a
good
dinner
when
he
came
,
barring
the
cross
-
cups
afterwards
?
<EOS>
And
had
n't
he
everything
agreeable
about
him
,
except
his
wife
?
<EOS>
which
was
a
great
drawback
.
<EOS>
And
with
all
his
peculiarities
and
humors
,
was
n't
he
as
kind
-
hearted
a
man
as
needs
be
?
<EOS>
and
an
Irishman
at
the
core
?
<EOS>
And
so
,
if
he
wern't
<EOS>
dead
,
I
'd
say
long
life
to
him
!
<EOS>
But
as
he
is
,
here
's
peace
to
his
memory!"At
<EOS>
this
juncture
,
a
knocking
was
heard
at
the
door
,
which
some
one
without
had
vainly
tried
to
open
.
<EOS>
Titus
rose
to
unclose
it
,
ushering
in
an
individual
known
at
the
hall
as
Jack
Palmer
.

CHAPTER
IX
.
—
<EOS>
AN
ENGLISH
<EOS>
ADVENTURERMrs
.
<EOS>
Peachem
.
<EOS>
Sure
the
captain
's
the
finest
gentleman
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
Beggar
's
Opera
.
<EOS>
JACK
PALMER
was
a
good
-
humored
,
good
-
looking
man
,
with
immense
bushy
,
red
whiskers
,
a
freckled
,
florid
complexion
,
and
sandy
hair
,
rather
inclined
to
scantiness
towards
the
scalp
of
the
head
,
which
garnished
the
nape
of
his
neck
with
a
ruff
of
crisp
little
curls
,
like
the
ring
on
a
monk
's
shaven
crown
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
tendency
to
baldness
,
Jack
could
not
be
more
than
thirty
,
though
his
looks
were
some
five
years
in
advance
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
one
of
those
inexplicable
countenances
,
which
appear
to
be
proper
to
a
peculiar
class
of
men
—
a
regular
Newmarket
physiognomy
—
compounded
chiefly
of
cunning
and
assurance
;
not
low
cunning
,
nor
vulgar
assurance
,
but
crafty
sporting
subtlety
,
careless
as
to
results
,
indifferent
to
obstacles
,
ever
on
the
alert
for
the
main
chance
,
game
and
turf
all
over
,
eager
,
yet
easy
,
keen
,
yet
quiet
.
<EOS>
He
was
somewhat
showily
dressed
,
in
such
wise
that
he
looked
half
like
a
fine
gentleman
of
that
day
,
half
like
a
jockey
of
our
own
.
<EOS>
His
nether
man
appeared
in
well
-
fitting
,
well
-
worn
buckskins
,
and
boots
with
tops
,
not
unconscious
of
the
saddle
;
while
the
airy
extravagance
of
his
broad
-
skirted
,
sky
-
blue
riding
coat
,
the
richness
of
his
vest
—
the
pockets
of
which
were
beautifully
exuberant
,
according
to
the
mode
of
1737—the
smart
luxuriance
of
his
cravat
,
and
a
certain
curious
taste
in
the
size
and
style
of
his
buttons
,
proclaimed
that
,
in
his
own
esteem
at
least
,
his
person
did
not
appear
altogether
unworthy
of
decoration
;
nor
,
in
justice
to
Jack
,
can
we
allow
that
he
was
in
error
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
model
of
a
man
for
five
feet
ten
;
square
,
compact
,
capitally
built
in
every
particular
,
excepting
that
his
legs
were
slightly
imbowed
,
which
defect
probably
arose
from
his
being
almost
constantly
on
horseback
;
a
sort
of
exercise
in
which
Jack
greatly
delighted
,
and
was
accounted
a
superb
rider
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
indeed
,
his
daring
horsemanship
,
upon
one
particular
occasion
,
when
he
had
outstripped
a
whole
field
,
that
had
procured
him
the
honor
of
an
invitation
to
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
Who
he
was
,
or
whence
he
came
,
was
a
question
not
easily
answered
—
Jack
,
himself
,
evading
all
solution
to
the
inquiry
.
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
never
troubled
his
head
about
the
matter
:
he
was
a
"
deuced
good
fellow
—
rode
well
,
and
stood
on
no
sort
of
ceremony
;
"
that
was
enough
for
him
.
<EOS>
Nobody
else
knew
anything
about
him
,
save
that
he
was
a
capital
judge
of
horseflesh
,
kept
a
famous
black
mare
,
and
attended
every
hunt
in
the
West
Riding
—
that
he
could
sing
a
good
song
,
was
a
choice
companion
,
and
could
drink
three
bottles
without
feeling
the
worse
for
them
.
<EOS>
Sensible
of
the
indecorum
that
might
attach
to
his
appearance
,
Dr.
Small
had
hastily
laid
down
his
pipe
,
and
arranged
his
wig
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
saw
who
was
the
intruder
,
with
a
grunt
of
defiance
he
resumed
his
occupation
,
without
returning
the
bow
of
the
latter
,
or
bestowing
further
notice
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Nothing
discomposed
at
the
churchman
's
displeasure
,
Jack
greeted
Titus
cordially
,
and
carelessly
saluting
Mr.
Coates
,
threw
himself
into
a
chair
.
<EOS>
He
next
filled
a
tumbler
of
claret
,
and
drained
it
at
a
draught
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
you
ridden
far
,
Jack
?
"
asked
Titus
,
noticing
the
dusty
state
of
Palmer
's
azure
attire
.
<EOS>
"Some
dozen
miles
,
"
replied
Palmer
;
"
and
that
,
on
such
a
sultry
afternoon
as
the
present
,
makes
one
feel
thirstyish
.
<EOS>
I
'm
as
dry
as
a
sandbed
.
<EOS>
Famous
wine
this
—
beautiful
tipple
—
better
than
all
your
red
fustian
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
how
poor
Sir
Piers
used
to
like
it
!
<EOS>
Well
,
that
's
all
over
—
<EOS>
a
glass
like
this
might
do
him
good
in
his
present
quarters
!
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
I
'm
intruding
.
<EOS>
But
the
fact
is
,
I
wanted
a
little
information
about
the
order
of
the
procession
,
and
missing
you
below
,
came
hither
in
search
of
you
.
<EOS>
You
're
to
be
chief
mourner
,
I
suppose
,
Titus
—
rehearsing
your
part
,
eh?""Come
,
come
,
Jack
,
no
joking
,
"
replied
Titus
;
"
the
subject
's
too
serious
.
<EOS>
I
am
to
be
chief
mourner
—
and
I
expect
you
to
be
a
mourner
—
and
everybody
else
to
be
mourners
.
<EOS>
We
must
all
mourn
at
the
proper
time
.
<EOS>
There
'll
be
a
power
of
people
at
the
church
.
<EOS>
""There
are
a
power
of
people
here
already
,
"
returned
Jack
,
"
if
they
all
attend
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
they
all
will
attend
,
or
what
is
the
eating
and
drinking
to
go
for
?
<EOS>
I
sha'n't
leave
a
soul
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
""Excepting
one
,
"
said
Jack
,
archly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lady
Rookwood
wo
n't
attend
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
excepting
her
ladyship
and
her
ladyship
's
abigail
.
<EOS>
All
the
rest
go
with
me
,
and
form
part
of
the
procession
.
<EOS>
You
go
too
.
<EOS>
""Of
course
.
<EOS>
At
what
time
do
you
start?""Twelve
precisely
.
<EOS>
As
the
clock
strikes
,
we
set
out
—
all
in
a
line
,
and
a
long
line
we
'll
make
.
<EOS>
I
'm
waiting
for
that
ould
coffin
-
faced
rascal
,
Peter
Bradley
,
to
arrange
the
order
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
long
will
it
all
occupy
,
think
you
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Jack
,
carelessly
.
<EOS>
"That
I
ca
n't
say
,
"
returned
Titus
;
"
possibly
an
hour
,
more
or
less
.
<EOS>
But
we
shall
start
to
the
minute
—
that
is
,
if
we
can
get
all
together
,
so
do
n't
be
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
And
hark
ye
,
Jack
,
you
must
contrive
to
change
your
toggery
.
<EOS>
That
sky
-
blue
coat
wo
n't
do
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
the
thing
at
all
,
at
all
.
<EOS>
""Never
fear
that
,
"
replied
Palmer
.
"
<EOS>
But
who
were

<EOS>
it
<EOS>
the

carriage
you
mean

<EOS>
Squire
Forester
and
his
sons
.
<EOS>
They
're
dining
with
the
other
gentlefolk
,
in
the
great
room
up
-
stairs
,
to
be
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
we
'll
have
a
grand
berrin
'
.
<EOS>
And
,
by
St.
Patrick
!
<EOS>
I
must
be
looking
after
it
.
<EOS>
""Stay
<EOS>
a
minute
<EOS>
,
"
said
Jack
;
"
let
's
have
a
cool
bottle
first
.
<EOS>
They
are
all
taking
care
of
themselves
below
,
and
Peter
Bradley
has
not
made
his
appearance
,
<EOS>
so
you
need
be
in
no

.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
with
you
presently
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
ring
for
the
claret?""By
<EOS>
all
means
,
"
replied
Titus
.
<EOS>
Jack
accordingly
arose
;
and
a
butler
answering
the
summons
,
a
long
-
necked
bottle
was
soon
placed
before
them
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
heard
of
the
affray
last
night
,
I
presume
?
"
said
Jack
,
renewing
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
"With
the
poachers
?
<EOS>
To
be
sure
I
did
.
<EOS>
Was
n't
I
called
in
to
examine
Hugh
Badger
's
wounds
<EOS>
the
first
thing
this
morning
;
and
a
deep
cut
<EOS>
there
was
,
just
over
the
eye
,
besides
other
bruises
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
the
wound
dangerous
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Palmer
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
exactly
mortal
,
if
you
mean
that
,
"
replied
the
Irishman
;
"
dangerous
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
""Humph
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Jack
;
"
they
'd
a
pretty
hardish
bout
of
it
,
I
understand
.
<EOS>
Anything
been
heard
of
the
body?""What
body
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Small
,
who
was
half
-
dozing
.
<EOS>
"The
body
of
the
drowned
poacher
,
"
replied
Jack
;
"
they
were
off
to
search
for
it
this
morning
.
<EOS>
""Found
<EOS>
it
—
not
they
!
"
exclaimed
Titus
.
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha!—I
ca
n't
help
laughing
,
for
the
life
and
sowl
of
me
;
a
capital
trick
he
played
'
em,—capital
—
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
the
fellow
did
?
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha!—after
leading
'em
the
devil
's
dance
,
all
around
the
park
,
killing
a
hound
as
savage
as
a
wolf
,
and
breaking
Hugh
Badger
's
head
,
which
is
as
hard
and
thick
as
a
butcher
's
block
,
what
does
the
fellow
do
but
dive
into
a
pool
,
with
a
great
rock
hanging
over
it
,
and
make
his
way
to
the
other
side
,
through
a
subterranean
cavern
,
which
nobody
knew
anything
about
,
till
they
came
to
drag
it
,
thinking
him
snugly
drowned
all
the
while
—
ha
,
ha!""Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
<EOS>
chorused
Jack
;
"
bravo
!
<EOS>
he
's
a
lad
of
the
right
sort
—
ha
,
ha!""He
!
<EOS>
who
?
"
inquired
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
"Why
,
the
poacher
,
to
be
sure
,
"
replied
Jack
;
"
who
else
were
we
talking
about?""Beg
pardon
,
"
returned
Coates
;
"
I
thought
you
might
have
heard
some
intelligence
.
<EOS>
We
've
got
an
eye
upon
him
.
<EOS>
We
know
who
it
was
.
""Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Jack
;
"
and
who
was
it?""A
fellow
known
by
the
name
of
Luke
Bradley
.
<EOS>
""Zounds
<EOS>
!
"
cried
Titus
,
"
you
do
n't
say
it
was
he
?
<EOS>
Murder
in
Irish
!
<EOS>
that
bates
everything
;
why
,
he
was
Sir
Piers's——""Natural
son
,
"
replied
the
attorney
;
"
he
has
not
been
heard
of
for
some
time
—
shockingly
incorrigible
rascal
—
impossible
to
do
anything
with
him
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
n't
say
so
?
<EOS>
"
observed
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
heard
Sir
Piers
speak
of
the
lad
;
and
,
by
his
account
,
he
's
as
fine
a
fellow
as
ever
crossed
tit
's
back
;
<EOS>
only
a
little
wildish
and
unreasonable
,
as
the
best
of
us
may
be
<EOS>
;
wants
breaking
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
Your
skittish
colt
makes
the
best
horse
,
and
so
would
he
.
<EOS>
To
speak
the
truth
,
I
'm
glad
he
escaped
.
<EOS>
""So
am
I
,
"
rejoined
Titus
;
"
for
,
in
the
first
place
,
I
've
a
foolish
partiality
for
poachers
,
and
am
sorry
when
any
of
'em
come
to
hurt
;
and
,
in
the
second
,
I
'd
be
mighty
displeased
if
any
ill
had
happened
to
one
of
Sir
Piers
's
flesh
and
blood
,
as
this
young
chap
appears
to
be
.
<EOS>
""Appears
to
be
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Palmer
<EOS>
;
"
there
's
no
appearing
in
the
case
,
I
take
it
.
<EOS>
This
Bradley
's
an
undoubted
offshoot
of
the
old
squire
.
<EOS>
His
mother
was
a
servant
-
maid
at
the
hall
,
I
rather
think
.
<EOS>
You
sir
,
"
continued
he
,
addressing
Coates
,
"
perhaps
,
can
inform
us
of
the
real
facts
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
""She
was
something
better
than
a
servant
,
"
replied
the
attorney
,
with
a
slight
cough
and
a
knowing
wink
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
her
quite
well
,
though
I
was
but
a
boy
then
;
a
lovely
creature
,
and
so
taking
,
I
do
n't
wonder
that
Sir
Piers
was
smitten
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
was
mad
after
the
women
in
those
days
,
and
pretty
Sue
Bradley
above
all
others
.
<EOS>
She
lived
with
him
quite
like
his
lady
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
I
've
heard
,
"
returned
Jack
;
"
and
she
remained
with
him
till
her
death
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
,
was
n't
there
something
rather
odd
in
the
way
in
which
she
died
,
rather
suddenish
and
unexpected,—a
noise
made
about
it
at
the
time
,
eh?""Not
that
I
ever
heard
,
"
replied
Coates
,
shaking
his
head
,
and
appearing
to
be
afflicted
with
an
instantaneous
ignorance
;
while
Titus
affected
not
to
hear
the
remark
,
but
occupied
himself
with
his
wine
-
glass
.
<EOS>
Small
snored
audibly
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
too
young
,
then
,
to
pay
any
attention
to
idle
rumors
,
"
continued
Coates
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
long
time
ago
.
<EOS>
May
I
ask
the
reason
of
your
inquiry?""Nothing
further
than
simple
curiosity
,
"
replied
Jack
,
enjoying
the
consternation
of
his
companions
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
as
you
say
,
a
long
while
since
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
singular
how
that
sort
of
thing
is
remembered
.
<EOS>
One
would
think
people
had
something
else
to
do
than
talk
of
one
's
private
affairs
for
ever
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
despise
such
tattle
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
persons
in
the
neighborhood
who
still
say
it
was
an
awkward
business
.
<EOS>
Amongst
others
,
I
've
heard
that
this
very
Luke
Bradley
talks
in
pretty
plain
terms
about
it
.
<EOS>
""Does
<EOS>
he
,
indeed
?
"
said
Coates
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
much
the
worse
for
him
.
<EOS>
Let
me
once
lay
hands
upon
him
,
and
I
'll
put
a
gag
in
his
mouth
that
shall
spoil
his
talking
in
the
future
.
<EOS>
""That
's
precisely
the
point
I
desire
to
arrive
at
,
"
replied
Jack
;
"
and
I
advise
you
by
all
means
to
accomplish
that
,
for
the
sake
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
Nobody
likes
his
friends
to
be
talked
about
.
<EOS>
So
I
'd
settle
the
matter
amicably
,
were
I
you
.
<EOS>
Just
let
the
fellow
go
his
way
;
he
wo
n't
return
here
again
in
a
hurry
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
<EOS>
As
to
clapping
him
in
quod
,
he
might
prattle
—
turn
stag
.
<EOS>
""Turn
stag
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Coates
,
"
<EOS>
what
the
deuce
is
that
?
<EOS>
In
my
opinion
,
he
has
'
turned
stag
'
already
.
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
he
'll
pay
deer
for
his
night
's
sport
,
you
may
depend
upon
it
.
<EOS>
What
signifies
it
what
he
says
?
<EOS>
Let
me
lay
hands
upon
him
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
well
,
"
said
Jack
,
"
no
offence
.
<EOS>
I
only
meant
to
offer
a
suggestion
.
<EOS>
I
thought
the
family
,
young
Sir
Ranulph
,
I
mean
,
might
n't
like
the
story
to
be
revived
.
<EOS>
As
to
Lady
Rookwood
,
she
do
n't
,
I
suppose
,
care
much
about
idle
reports
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
if
I
've
been
rightly
informed
,
she
bears
this
youngster
no
particular
good
-
will
to
begin
with
,
and
has
tried
hard
to
get
him
out
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
you
say
,
what
does
it
signify
what
he
says
?
<EOS>
he
can
only
talk
.
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
is
dead
and
gone
.
<EOS>
""Humph
!
"
muttered
Coates
,
peevishly
.
"But
<EOS>
it
does
seem
a
little
hard
,
that
a
lad
should
swing
for
killing
a
bit
of
venison
in
his
own
father
's
park
.
<EOS>
""Which
<EOS>
he
'd
a
nat'ral
right
to
do
,
"
cried
Titus
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
had
no
natural
right
to
bruise
,
violently
assault
,
and
endanger
the
life
of
his
father
's
,
or
anybody
else
's
gamekeeper
,
"
retorted
Coates
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
sir
,
he
's
committed
a
capital
offence
,
and
if
he
's
taken——""No
chance
of
that
,
I
hope
,
"
interrupted
Jack
.
<EOS>
"That
's
a
wish
I
ca
n't
help
wishing
myself
,
"
said
Titus
:
"
<EOS>
on
my
conscience
,
these
poachers
are
fine
boys
,
when
all
's
said
and
done
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
finest
of
all
boys
,
"
exclaimed
Jack
,
with
a
kindred
enthusiasm
,
"
are
those
birds
of
the
night
,
and
minions
of
the
moon
,
whom
we
call
,
most
unjustly
,
poachers
.
<EOS>
They
are
,
after
all
,
only
professional
sportsmen
,
making
a
business
of
what
we
make
a
pleasure
;
a
nightly
pursuit
of
what
is
to
us
a
daily
relaxation
;
there
's
the
main
distinction
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
rest
,
it
's
all
in
idea
;
they
merely
thin
an
overstocked
park
,
as
you
would
reduce
a
plethoric
patient
,
doctor
;
or
as
you
would
work
a
moneyed
client
,
if
you
got
him
into
Chancery
,
Mister
Attorney
.
<EOS>
And
then
how
much
more
scientifically
and
systematically
they
set
to
work
than
we
amateurs
do
!
<EOS>
how
noiselessly
they
bag
a
hare
,
smoke
a
pheasant
,
or
knock
a
buck
down
with
an
air
-
gun
!
<EOS>
how
independent
are
they
of
any
license
,
except
that
of
a
good
eye
,
and
a
swift
pair
of
legs
!
<EOS>
how
unnecessary
is
it
for
them
to
ask
permission
to
shoot
over
Mr.
So
-
and
-
so
's
grounds
,
or
my
Lord
<EOS>
That
's
preserves
!
<EOS>
they
are
free
of
every
cover
,
and
indifferent
to
any
alteration
in
the
game
laws
.
<EOS>
I
've
some
thoughts
,
when
everything
else
fails
,
of
taking
to
poaching
myself
.
<EOS>
In
my
opinion
,
a
poacher
's
a
highly
respectable
character
.
<EOS>
What
say
you
,
Mr.
Coates
?
"
<EOS>
turning
very
gravely
to
that
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"Such
<EOS>
a
question
,
sir
,
"
replied
Coates
,
bridling
up
,
"
scarcely
deserves
a
serious
answer
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
doubt
you
will
next
maintain
that
a
highwayman
is
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
""Most
<EOS>
undoubtedly
,
"
replied
Palmer
,
in
the
same
grave
tone
,
which
might
have
passed
for
banter
,
had
Jack
ever
bantered
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
maintain
and
prove
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
how
he
can
be
otherwise
.
<EOS>
It
is
as
necessary
for
a
man
to
be
a
gentleman
before
he
can
turn
highwayman
,
as
it
is
for
a
doctor
to
have
his
diploma
,
or
an
attorney
his
certificate
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
finest
gentlemen
of
their
day
,
as
Captain
Lovelace
,
Hind
,
Hannum
,
and
Dudley
,
were
eminent
on
the
road
,
and
they
set
the
fashion
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
their
day
a
real
highwayman
would
consider
himself
disgraced
,
if
he
did
not
conduct
himself
in
every
way
like
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
there
are
pretenders
in
this
line
,
as
in
everything
else
.
<EOS>
But
these
are
only
exceptions
,
and
prove
the
rule
.
<EOS>
What
are
the
distinguishing
characteristics
of
a
fine
gentleman?—perfect
knowledge
of
the
world
—
perfect
independence
of
character
—
notoriety
—
command
of
cash
—
and
inordinate
success
with
the
women
.
<EOS>
You
grant
all
these
premises
?
<EOS>
First
,
then
,
it
is
part
of
a
highwayman
's
business
to
be
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
is
the
easiest
and
pleasantest
fellow
going
.
<EOS>
There
is
Tom
King
,
for
example
:
he
is
the
handsomest
man
about
town
,
and
the
best
-
bred
fellow
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
Then
whose
inclinations
are
so
uncontrolled
as
the
highwayman
's
,
so
long
as
the
mopuses
last
?
<EOS>
who
produces
so
great
an
effect
by
so
few
words?—'STAND
AND
DELIVER
!
'
<EOS>
is
sure
to
arrest
attention
.
<EOS>
Every
one
is
captivated
by
an
address
so
taking
.
<EOS>
As
to
money
,
he
wins
a
purse
of
a
hundred
guineas
as
easily
as
you
would
the
same
sum
from
the
faro
table
.
<EOS>
And
wherein
lies
the
difference
?
<EOS>
only
in
the
name
of
the
game
.
<EOS>
Who
so
little
need
of
a
banker
as
he
?
<EOS>
all
he
has
to
apprehend
is
a
check
—
all
he
has
to
draw
is
a
trigger
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
women
,
they
dote
upon
him
:
not
even
your
red
-
coat
is
so
successful
.
<EOS>
Look
at
a
highwayman
mounted
on
his
flying
steed
,
with
his
pistols
in
his
holsters
,
and
his
mask
upon
his
face
.
<EOS>
What
can
be
a
more
gallant
sight
?
<EOS>
The
clatter
of
his
horse
's
heels
is
like
music
to
his
ear
—
he
is
in
full
quest
—
he
shouts
to
the
fugitive
horseman
to
stay
—
the
other
flies
all
the
faster
—
what
chase
can
be
half
so
exciting
as
that
?
<EOS>
Suppose
he
overtakes
his
prey
,
which
ten
to
one
he
will
,
how
readily
his
summons
to
deliver
is
obeyed
!
<EOS>
how
satisfactory
is
the
appropriation
of
a
lusty
purse
or
corpulent
pocket
-
book!—getting
<EOS>
the
brush
is
nothing
to
it
.
<EOS>
How
tranquilly
he
departs
,
takes
off
his
hat
to
his
accommodating
acquaintance
,
wishes
him
a
pleasant
journey
,
and
disappears
across
the
heath
!
<EOS>
England
,
sir
,
has
reason
to
be
proud
of
her
highwaymen
.
<EOS>
They
are
peculiar
to
her
clime
,
and
are
as
much
before
the
brigand
of
Italy
,
the
contrabandist
of
Spain
,
or
the
cut
-
purse
of
France
—
as
her
sailors
are
before
all
the
rest
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
The
day
will
never
come
,
I
hope
,
when
we
shall
degenerate
into
the
footpad
,
and
lose
our
Night
Errantry
.
<EOS>
Even
the
French
borrow
from
us
—
they
have
only
one
highwayman
of
eminence
,
and
he
learnt
and
practised
his
art
in
England
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
who
was
he
,
may
I
ask
?
"
said
Coates
.
<EOS>
"Claude
<EOS>
Du
-
Val
,
"
replied
Jack
;
"
and
though
a
Frenchman
,
he
was
a
deuced
fine
fellow
in
his
day
—
quite
a
tip
-
top
macaroni
<EOS>
—
he
could
skip
and
twirl
like
a
figurant
,
warble
like
an
opera
-
singer
,
and
play
the
flageolet
better
than
any
man
of
his
day
—
he
always
carried
a
lute
in
his
pocket
,
along
with
his
snappers
.
<EOS>
And
then
his
dress
—
it
was
quite
beautiful
to
see
how
smartly
he
was
rigg'd
out
,
<EOS>
all
velvet
and
lace
;
and
even
with
his
vizard
on
his
face
,
the
ladies
used
to
cry
out
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
Then
he
took
a
purse
with
the
air
and
grace
of
a
receiver
-
general
.
<EOS>
All
the
women
adored
him
—
and
that
,
bless
their
pretty
faces
!
<EOS>
was
the
best
proof
of
his
gentility
.
<EOS>
I
wish
he
'd
not
been
a
Mounseer
.
<EOS>
The
women
never
mistake
.
<EOS>
They
can
always
discover
the
true
gentlemen
,
and
they
were
all
,
of
every
degree
,
from
the
countess
to
the
kitchen
-
maid
,
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
him
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
he
was
taken
,
I
suppose
?
"
asked
Coates
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
"
responded
Jack
,
"
the
women
were
his
undoing
,
as
they
've
been
many
a
brave
fellow
's
before
,
and
will
be
again
.
<EOS>
"
Touched
by
which
reflection
,
Jack
became
for
once
in
his
life
sentimental
,
and
sighed
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Du
-
Val
!
<EOS>
he
was
seized
at
the
Hole
-
in
-
the
-
Wall
in
Chandos
-
street
by
the
bailiff
of
Westminster
,
<EOS>
when
dead
drunk
,
his
liquor
having
been
drugged
by
his
dells
—
and
was
shortly
afterwards
hanged
at
Tyburn
.
<EOS>
""It
was
thousand
pities
,
"
said
Mr.
Coates
,
with
a
sneer
,
"
that
so
fine
a
gentleman
should
come
to
<EOS>
so
ignominious
<EOS>
an
end!""Quite
<EOS>
the
contrary
,
"
returned
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
his
biographer
,
Doctor
Pope
,
properly
remarks
,
'
Who
is
there
worthy
of
the
name
of
man
,
that
would
not
prefer
such
a
death
before
a
mean

solitary
,
inglorious
life
?

're
upon

if

I
'll
sing
you
a
song
about
highwaymen
.
<EOS>
""I
should
like
it
of
all
things
,
"
replied
Titus
,
who
entertained
a
very
favorable
opinion
of
Jack
's
vocal
powers
,
and
was
by
no
means
an
indifferent
performer
;
"
only
let
it
be
in
a
minor
key
.
<EOS>
"Jack
required
no
further
encouragement
,
but
disregarding
the
hints
and
looks
of
Coates
,
sang
with
much
unction
the
following
ballad
to
a
good
old
tune
,
then
very
popular
—
the
merit
of
which

nobody

"A

But
the

<EOS>
"A

song

by

<EOS>
cried
Titus
,
as
Jack
's
ditty
came
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
"
But
your
English
robbers
are
nothing
at
all
,
compared
with
our
Tories[14
]
and
Rapparees
—
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
They
were
the
raal
gentlemen

they
were
the
boys
to
cut
a
throat
aisily

<EOS>
""Pshaw

exclaimed
Jack
,
in
disgust
,
"

<EOS>
""Maybe
<EOS>
not

"
replied
Titus
;
"
I
'll
not
dispute
the
point
—
but
these
Rapparees
were
true
brothers
of

<EOS>
I
'll
just
sing
you

I
made
about

<EOS>
added
he
,
winking
at
the
somnolent
Small
.
<EOS>
And
tossing
off
his
glass
,
Titus
delivered
himself
with
much
joviality
of
the
following
ballad
;
the
words
of
which
he
adapted
to
the
tune
of
the
Groves
of
the
Pool
:
THE
RAPPAREESLet
the
Englishman
boast
of
his
Turpins
and
Sheppards
,
as
cocks
of
the
walk
,
His
Mulsacks
,
and
Cheneys
,
and
Swiftnecks[15]—it
's
all
botheration
and
talk;Compared
with
the
robbers
of
Ireland
<EOS>
,
they
do
n't
come
within
half
a
mile
,
There
never
were
yet
any
rascals
like
those
of
my
own
native
isle!First
and
foremost
<EOS>
comes
Redmond
O'Hanlon
,
allowed
the
first
thief
of
the
world,[16]That
o'er
the
broad
province
of
Ulster
the
Rapparee
banner
unfurled;Och
!
<EOS>
he
was
an
elegant
fellow
,
as
ever
you
saw
in
your
life
,
At
fingering
the
blunderbuss
trigger
,
or
handling
the
throat

cutting
knife

And

and
sprees
,
Not
a
rap
<EOS>
did
they
leave
in
the
country
,
and
hence
they
were
called
Rapparees.[17]Next
<EOS>
comes
POWER
,
the
great
Tory[18
]
of
Munster
,
a
gentleman
born
every
inch
,
And
strong
Jack
Macpherson

not

e'en
his
courage
could
damp

<EOS>
For
as
he
was
led
to

he
played
his

<EOS>
"[19]Paddy
<EOS>
Fleming
,
Dick
Balf
,
and
Mulhoni

I
think
are
the
next
on
my
list
,
All
adepts
in
the
beautiful
science
of
giving
a
pocket
a
twist;Jemmy
Carrick
must
follow
his
leaders
,
ould
Purney
who
put
in
a
huff
,
By
dancing
a
hornpipe
at
Tyburn
,
and
bothering
the
hangman
for
snuff

<EOS>
There
's
Paul
Liddy
,
the
curly

pate
Tory
,
whose
noddle
was
stuck
on
a
spike
,
And
Billy
Delaney
,
the
"
Songster,"[20

<EOS>
we
never
shall
meet
with
his
like;For
his
neck

a
witch

anointed

and
warranted
safe
by
her
charm
,
No
hemp
that
was
ever
yet
twisted

wonderful
throttle
could
harm

<EOS>
And
lastly
,
there
's
Cahir
Na
Cappul
,
the
handiest
rogue
of
them
all

<EOS>
Who
only
need
whisper
a
word
,
and
your
horse
will
trot
out
of
his
stall;Your
tit
is
not
safe
in
your
stable
,
though
you
or
your
groom
should
be
near
,
And
devil
a
bit
in
the
paddock
,
if
Cahir
gets
hould
of
his
ear
.
<EOS>
Then
success
to
the
Tories
of
Ireland
,
the
generous
,
the
gallant
,
the
gay!With
them
the
best
Rumpads[21
]
of
England
are
not
to
be
named
the
same
day!And
<EOS>
were
further
proof
wanting
to
show
what
precedence
we
take
with
our
prigs
,
Recollect
that
our
robbers
are
Tories
,
while
those
of
yourcountry
are
Whigs
.
"Bravissimo
!
"
cried
Jack
,
drumming
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
"
said
Coates
,
"
we
've
had
enough
about
the
Irish
highwaymen
,
in
all
conscience
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
a
rascal
on
our
side
of
the
Channel
,
whom
you
have
only
incidentally
mentioned
,
and
who
makes
more
noise
than
them
all
put
together
.
<EOS>
""Who
<EOS>
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Jack
,
with
some
curiosity
.
<EOS>
"Dick
Turpin
,
"
replied
the
attorney
:
"
he
seems
to
me
quite
as
worthy
of
mention
as
any
of
the
Hinds
,
the
Du
-
Vals
,
or
the
O'Hanlons
,
you
have
either
of
you
enumerated
.
<EOS>
""I
did
not
think
of
him
,
"
replied
Palmer
,
smiling
;
"
though
,
if
I
had
,
he
scarcely
deserves
to
be
ranked
with
those
illustrious
heroes
.
<EOS>
""Gads
bobs
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Titus
;
"
they
tell
me
Turpin
keeps
the
best
nag
in
the
United
Kingdom
,
and
can
ride
faster
and
further
in
a
day
than
any
other
man
in
a
week

<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
I
've
heard
,
"
said
Palmer
,
with
a
glance
of
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
try
a
run
with
him

I
warrant
me
,
I
'd
not
be
far
behind
.
<EOS>
""I
should
like
to
get
a
peep
at
him
,
"
quoth
Titus
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
should
I
,
"
added
Coates
.
<EOS>
"
Vastly!""You
may
both
of
you
be
gratified
,
gentlemen

"
said
Palmer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Talking
of
Dick
Turpin
,
they
say
,
is
like
speaking
of
the
devil
,
he
's
at
your
elbow
<EOS>
ere
the
word
's
well
out
of
your
mouth
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
within
hearing
at
this
moment
,
for
anything
we
know
to
the
contrary

<EOS>
""Body
<EOS>
o
'
me
!

<EOS>
ejaculated
Coates
,
"
you
do
n't
say
so
?
<EOS>
Turpin
in
Yorkshire
!
<EOS>
I
thought
he
confined
his
exploits
to
the
neighborhood
of
the
metropolis
,
and
made
Epping
Forest
his
headquarters
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
he
did
,
"
replied
Jack
,
"
but
the
cave
is
all
up
now
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
the
great
North
Road
,
from
Tottenham
Cross
to
York
gates
,
comes
within
Dick
's
present
range
;
and
Saint
Nicholas
only
knows
in
which
part
of
it
<EOS>
he
is
most
likely
to
be
found
.
<EOS>
He
shifts
his
quarters
as
often
and
as
readily
as
a
Tartar
;
and
he
who
looks
for
him
may
chance
to
catch
a
Tartar
—
ha!—ha!""It
's
a
disgrace
to
the
country
that
such
a
rascal
should
remain
unhanged
,
"
returned
Coates
,
peevishly
.
<EOS>
"
Government
ought
to
look
to
it
.
<EOS>
Is
the
whole
kingdom
to
be
kept
in
a
state
of
agitation
by
a
single
highwayman?—Sir
Robert
Walpole
should
take
the
affair
into
his
own
hands
.
<EOS>
""Fudge
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Jack
,
emptying
his
glass
.
<EOS>
"I
have
already
addressed
a
letter
to
the
editor
of
the
Common
Sense
on
the
subject
,
"
said
Coates
,
"
in
which
I
have
spoken
my
mind
pretty
plainly
:
<EOS>
and
I
repeat
,
it
is
perfectly
disgraceful
that
such
a
rascal
should
be
suffered
to
remain
at
large
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
n't
happen
to
have
that
letter
by
you
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Jack
,
"
or
I
should
beg
the
favor
to
hear
it?—I
am
not
acquainted
with
the
newspaper
to
which
you
allude;—I
read
Fog
's
Journal
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
I
thought
,
"
replied
Coates
,
with
a
sneer
;
"
that
's
the
reason
you
are
so
easily
mystified
.
<EOS>
But
luckily
I
have
the
paper
in
my
pocket
;
and
you
are
quite
welcome
to
my
opinions
.
<EOS>
Here
it
is
,
"
added
he
,
drawing
forth
a
newspaper
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
waive
my
preliminary
remarks
,
and
come
to
the
point
at
once
.
<EOS>
""By
<EOS>
all
means
,
"
said
Jack
.
<EOS>
"'I
<EOS>
thank
God
,
'
"
began
Coates
,
in
an
authoritative
tone
,
"
'
that
I
was
born
in
a
country
that
hath
formerly
emulated
the
Romans
in
their
public
spirit
;
as
is
evident
from
their
conquests
abroad
,
and
their
struggles
for
liberty
at
home

<EOS>
'""What
<EOS>

all
this
got
to
do

Turpin

Jack

<EOS>
"You
will
hear

replied
the
attorney—"no

you
please

<EOS>
But
this
noble
principle

"
continued
he
,
with
great
emphasis
,
"
'
though
not
utterly
lost
,
I
can
not
think
at
present
so
active

it
ought
to
be
in

nation
so
jealous
of
her
liberty

<EOS>
'""Good

exclaimed
Jack

"
There
is
more
than

in
that
observation
,
Mr.
Coates
.
<EOS>
""'My
suspicion
,
'
"
proceeded
Coates
,
"
'
is
founded
on
a
late
instance
.
<EOS>
I
mean
the
flagrant
,
undisturbed
success
of
the
notorious
TURPIN
,
who
hath
robb'd
<EOS>
in
a
manner
scarce
ever
known
before
for
several
years
,
and
is
grown
so
insolent
and
impudent
as
to
threaten
particular
persons
,
and
become
openly
dangerous
to
the
lives
as
well
as
fortunes
of
the
people
of
England
.
<EOS>
'""Better
and
better
,
"
shouted
Jack
,
laughing
immoderately
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
go
on
,
sir
.
<EOS>
""'That
<EOS>
a
fellow
,
'
"
continued
Coates
,
"
'
who
is
known
to
be
a
thief
by
the
whole
kingdom
,
shall
for
so
long
a
time
continue

us

not

rob

of
us——'""Ha

Excuse

roared
Jack
,
laughing
till
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks—"pray
,
pray
,
go
on

<EOS>
""I
see
nothing
to
laugh
at
,
"
replied
Coates
,
somewhat
offended
;
"
however
,
I
will
conclude
my
letter
,
since
I
have
begun
it—'not
only
rob
us
,
but
make
a
jest
of
us
,
shall
defy
the
laws
,
and
laugh
at
justice
,
argues
a
want
of
public
spirit
,
which
should
make
every
particular
member
of
the
community
sensible
of
the
public
calamity
,
and
ambitious
of
the
honor
of
extirpating
such
a
notorious
highwayman
from
society
,
since
he
owes
his
long
successes
to
no
other
cause
than
his
immoderate
impudence
,
and
the
sloth
and
pusillanimity
of
those
who
ought
to
bring
him
to
justice
.
'
<EOS>
I
will
not
deny
,
"
continued
Coates
,
"
that
,
professing
myself
,
as
I
do
,
to
be
a
staunch
new
Whig
,
I
had
not
some
covert
political
object
in
penning
this
epistle.[22
]
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
setting
aside
my
principles——""Right
,
"
observed
Jack
;
"
you
Whigs
,
new
or
old
,
always
set
aside
your
principles
.
<EOS>
""Setting
aside
any
political
feeling
I
may
entertain
,
"
continued
Coates
,
<EOS>
disregarding
the
interruption
,
"
I
repeat
,
I
am
ambitious
of
extirpating
this
modern
Cacus
—
this
Autolycus
of
the
eighteenth
century
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
what
course
do
you
mean
to
pursue
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Jack
,
"
for
I
suppose
you
do
not
expect
to
catch
this

as
you
call
him
,
by
a
line
in

<EOS>
""I
am
in
the
habit
of
keeping
my
own
counsel
,
sir
,
"
replied
Coates
,
pettishly
;
"
and
to
be
plain
with
you
,
<EOS>
I
hope
to
finger
all
the
reward
myself
.
<EOS>
""Oons
,
is
there
a
reward
offered
for
Turpin
's
apprehension
?
"
asked
Titus
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
less
than
two
hundred
pounds
,
"
answered
Coates
,
"
and
that
's
no
trifle
,
as
you
will
both
admit
.
<EOS>
Have
you
not
seen
the
king
's
proclamation
,
Mr.
Palmer?""Not
I
,
"
replied
Jack
,
with
affected
indifference
.
<EOS>
"Nor
<EOS>
I
,
"
added
Titus
,
with
some
appearance
of
curiosity
;
"
do
you
happen
to
have
that
by
you
too?""I
always
carry
it
about
with
me
,
"
replied
Coates
,
"
that
I
may
refer
to
it
in
case
of
emergency

<EOS>
My
father
,
Christopher
,
or
Kit
Coates
,
as
he
was
familiarly
called
,
was
a
celebrated
thief
-
taker
.
<EOS>
He
apprehended
Spicket
,
and
Child
,
and
half
a
dozen
others
,
and
always
kept
their
descriptions
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
I
endeavor
to
tread
in
my
worthy
father
's
footsteps
.
<EOS>
I
hope
to
signalize
myself
by
capturing
a
highwayman
.
<EOS>
By

the

by
,
"
added
he
,
surveying
Jack
more
narrowly
,
"
it
occurs
to
me
that
Turpin
must
be
rather
like
you
,
Mr.
Palmer?""Like
me
,
"
said
Jack
,
regarding
Coates
askance
;
"
like
me
—
how
am
I
to
understand
you
,
sir
,
eh?""No
offence

<EOS>
none
whatever

<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
stay
,
you
wo
n't
object
to
my
comparing
the
description

<EOS>
That
can
do
no

<EOS>
Nobody
would
take
you
for

These
things
do
happen
sometimes
:
not
very
often

though
.
<EOS>
But
here
is
Turpin
's
description
in
the
Gazette
,
June
28th
,
<EOS>
A.D.
1737:—'It
having
been
represented
to

King
that

on
Wednesday

the
4th
of

rob

his
Majesty
's
highway
Vavasour
Mowbray

of

of
Horse
Grenadiers'—that

is
a

of
the

and
cousin

a

of
two

to
any
person
or
persons
who
shall
discover
him
,
so
as
he
may
be
apprehended
and
convicted
.
<EOS>
'""Odsbodikins
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Titus
,
"
a
noble
reward
!
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
lay
hands
upon
Turpin
,
"
added
he
,
slapping
Palmer
's
shoulder
<EOS>
:
"
I
wish
he
were
in
your
place
at
this
moment
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
""Thank
you
!
"
replied
Palmer
,
shifting
his
chair
.
<EOS>
"'Turpin
<EOS>
,
'
"
continued
Coates
,
"
'
was
born
at
Thacksted
,
in
Essex
;
is
about
thirty'—you
,
sir
,
I
believe
,
are
about
thirty
?
"
<EOS>
added
he
,
addressing
Palmer
.
<EOS>
"Thereabouts
,
"
said
Jack
,
bluffly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
what
has
my
age
to
do
with
that
of
Turpin?""Nothing
—
<EOS>
nothing
at
all
,
"
answered
Coates
;
"
suffer
me
,
however
,
to
proceed:—'Is
by
trade
a
butcher,'—you
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
believe
,
never
had
any
dealings
in
that
line?""I
have
some
notion
how
to
dispose
of
a
troublesome
calf
,
"
returned
Jack
.
"
<EOS>
But
Turpin
,
though
described
as
a
butcher
,
is
,
I
understand
,
a
lineal
descendant
of
a
great
French
archbishop
of
the
same
name
.
<EOS>
""Who
wrote
the
chronicles
of
that
royal
robber
Charlemagne
;
I
know
him
,
"
replied
Coates—"a
terrible
<EOS>
liar!—The
<EOS>
modern
Turpin
'
is
about
five
feet
nine
inches
<EOS>
high'—exactly
your
height
,
sir
—
exactly!""I
am
five
feet
ten
,
"
answered
Jack
,
standing
bolt
upright
.
<EOS>
"You
have
an
inch
,
then
,
in
your
favor
,
"
returned
the
unperturbed
attorney
,
deliberately
proceeding
with
his
examination—"'he
<EOS>
has
a
brown
complexion
,
marked
with
the
smallpox
.
'""My
<EOS>
complexion
is
florid
—
my
face
without
a
seam
,
"
quoth
Jack
.
<EOS>
"Those
<EOS>
whiskers
would
conceal
anything
,
"
replied
Coates
,
with
a
grin
.
"
<EOS>
Nobody
wears
whiskers
nowadays
,
except
a
highwayman
.
""Sir
!
"
said
Jack
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
personal
.
<EOS>
""I
do
n't
mean
to
be
so
,
"
replied
Coates
;
"
but
you
must
allow
the
description
tallies
with
your
own
in
a
remarkable
manner
.
<EOS>
Hear
me
out
,
however—'his
cheek
bones
are
broad
—
his
face
is
thinner
towards
the
bottom
—
his
visage
short
—
pretty
upright
—
and
broad
about
the
shoulders
.
'
<EOS>
Now
I
appeal
to
Mr.
Tyrconnel
if
all
this
does
not
sound
like
a
portrait
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
""Don't
<EOS>
appeal
to
me
,
"
said
Titus
,
hastily
,
"
upon
such
a
delicate
point
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
that
I
approve
of
a
gentleman
being
likened
to
a
highwayman
.
<EOS>
But
if
ever
there
was
a
highwayman
I
'd
wish
to
resemble
,
it
's
either
Redmond
O'Hanlon
or
Richard
Turpin
;
and
may
the
devil
burn
me
if
I
know
which
of
the
two
is
the
greater
rascal!""Well
,
Mr.
Palmer
,
"
said
Coates
,
"
I
repeat
,
I
mean
no
offence
.
<EOS>
Likenesses
are
unaccountable
.
<EOS>
I
am
said
to
be
like
my
Lord
North
;
whether
I
am
or
not
,
the
Lord
knows
.
<EOS>
But
if
ever
I
meet
with
Turpin
I
shall
bear
you
in
mind
—
<EOS>
he
—
he
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
if
ever
I
should
have
the
good
luck
to
stumble
upon
him
,
I
've
a
plan
for
his
capture
which
could
n't
fail
.
<EOS>
Only
let
me
get
a
glimpse
of
him
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
You
shall
see
how
I
'll
dispose
of
him
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
sir
,
we
shall
see
,
"
observed
Palmer
.
"
<EOS>
And
for
your
own
sake
,
I
wish
you
may
never
be
nearer
to
him
than
you
are
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
With
his
friends
,
they
say
Dick
Turpin
can
be
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
;
with
his
foes
,
especially
with
a
limb
of
the
law
like
yourself
,
he
's
been
found
but
an
ugly
customer
.
<EOS>
I
once
saw
him
at
Newmarket
,
where
he
was
collared
by
two
constable
culls
,
one
on
each
side
.
<EOS>
Shaking
off
one
,
and
dealing
the
other
a
blow
in
the
face
with
his
heavy
-
handled
whip
,
he
stuck
spurs
into
his
mare
,
and
though
the
whole
field
gave
chase
,
he
distanced
them
all
,
easily
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
how
came
you
not
to
try
your
pace
with
him
,
if
you
were
there
,
as
you
boasted
a
short
time
ago
?
"
asked
Coates
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
I
did
,
and
stuck
closer
to
him
than
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
We
were
neck
and
neck
.
<EOS>
I
was
the
only
person
who
could
have
delivered
him
to
the
hands
of
justice
,
if
I
'd
felt
inclined
.
<EOS>
""Zounds
!
"
cried
Coates
;
"
If
I
had
a
similar
opportunity
,
it
should
be
neck
or
nothing
.
<EOS>
Either
he
or
I
should
reach
the
scragging
-
post
first
.
<EOS>
I
'd
take
him
,
dead
or
alive
.
<EOS>
""You
take
Turpin
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
with
a
sneer
.
<EOS>
"I'd
<EOS>
engage
to
do
it
,
"
replied
Coates
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
bet
you
a
hundred
guineas
<EOS>
I
take
him
,
if
I
ever
have
the
same
chance
.
<EOS>
""Done
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Jack
,
rapping
the
table
at
the
same
time
,
so
that
the
glasses
danced
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"That
's
right
,
"
cried
Titus
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
<EOS>
you
halves
.
<EOS>
""What
's
the
matter
<EOS>
—
what
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Small
,
awakened
from
his
doze
.
<EOS>
"Only
<EOS>
a
trifling
bet
about
a
highwayman
,
"
replied
Titus
.
<EOS>
"A
highwayman
!
"
echoed
Small
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Eh
!
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
there
are
none
in
the
house
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
not
,
"
answered
Coates
.
<EOS>
"
But
this
gentleman
has
taken
up
the
defence
of
the
notorious
Dick
Turpin
in
so
singular
a
manner
,
that——""Quod
factu
foedum
est
,
idem
est
et
Dictu
Turpe
,
"
returned
Small
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
less
said
about
that
rascal
the
better
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
I
think
,
"
replied
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
as
you
say
,
sir
—
were
Dick
here
,
he
would
,
I
am
sure
,
take
the
freedom
to
hide
'
em
.
"Further
<EOS>
discourse
was
cut
short
by
the
sudden
opening
of
the
door
,
followed
by
the
abrupt
entrance
of
a
tall
,
slender
young
man
,
who
hastily
advanced
towards
the
table
,
around
which
the
company
were
seated
.
<EOS>
His
appearance
excited
the
utmost
astonishment
in
the
whole
group
:
curiosity
was
exhibited
in
every
countenance
—
the
magnum
remained
poised
midway
in
the
hand
of
Palmer
—
Dr
.
<EOS>
Small
scorched
his
thumb
in
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
;
and
Mr.
Coates
was
almost
choked
,
by
swallowing
an
inordinate
whiff
of
vapor
.
<EOS>
"Young
<EOS>
Sir
Ranulph
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
he
,
as
soon
as
the
syncope
would
permit
him
.
<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
Ranulph
here
?
"
echoed
Palmer
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"Angels
<EOS>
and
ministers
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Small
.
"Odsbodikins
!
"
cried
Titus
,
with
a
theatrical
start
;
<EOS>
"
this
is
more
than
I
expected
.
<EOS>
""Gentlemen
,
"
said
Ranulph
,
"
do
not
let
my
unexpected
arrival
here
discompose
you
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Small
,
you
will
excuse
the
manner
of
my
greeting
;
and
you
,
Mr.
Coates
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
present
party
,
I
believe
,
was
my
father
's
medical
attendant
,
Dr.
Tyrconnel
.
<EOS>
""I
had
that
honor
,
"
replied
the
Irishman
,
<EOS>
bowing
profoundly—"I
am
Dr.
Tyrconnel
,
Sir
Ranulph
,
at
your
service
.
<EOS>
""When
,
and
at
what
hour
,
did
my
father
breathe
his
last
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"Poor
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
,
"
answered
Titus
,
again
bowing
,
"
departed
this
life
on
Thursday
last
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
hour?—the
precise
minute
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Ranulph
,
eagerly
.
"Troth
,
Sir
Ranulph
,
as
nearly
as
I
can
recollect
,
it
might
be
a
few
minutes
before
midnight
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
very
hour
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Ranulph
,
striding
towards
the
window
.
<EOS>
His
steps
were
arrested
as
his
eye
fell
upon
the
attire
of
his
father
,
which
,
as
we
have
before
noticed
,
hung
at
that
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
A
slight
shudder
passed
over
his
frame
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
momentary
pause
,
during
which
Ranulph
continued
gazing
intently
at
the
apparel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
very
dress
,
too
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
he
;
then
turning
to
the
assembly
,
who
were
watching
his
movements
with
surprise
;
"
Doctor
,
"
said
he
,
addressing
Small
,
"
I
have
something
for
your
private
ear
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
will
you

"THERE

my
dear
young
friend

and

"
said
Dr.
Small
,
as
the

was
closed
,
"
that
weighs
upon
your
mind
,
beyond
the
sorrow
naturally
incident
to
an
affliction
,
severe
as
the
present
.
<EOS>
Forgive
my
apprehensions
if
I
am
wrong
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
affectionate
interest
I
have
ever
felt
for
you
—
an
interest
which
,
I
assure
you
,
is
nowise
diminished
,
and
which
will
excuse
my
urging
you
to
unburden
your
mind
to
me
;
assuring
yourself
,
that
whatever
may
be
your
disclosure
,
you
will
have
my
sincere
sympathy
and
commiseration
.
<EOS>
I
may
be
better
able
to
advise
with
you
,
should
counsel
be
necessary
,
than
others
,
from
my
knowledge
of
your
character
and
temperament
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
anticipate
evil
,
and
am
,
perhaps
,
unnecessarily
apprehensive
.
<EOS>
But
I
own
,
I
am
startled
at
the
incoherence
of
your
expressions
,
coupled
with
your
sudden
and
almost
mysterious
appearance
at
this
distressing
conjuncture
.
<EOS>
Answer
me
:
<EOS>
has
your
return
been
the
result
of
mere
accident
?
<EOS>
is
it
to
be
considered
one
of
those
singular
circumstances
which
almost
look
like
fate
,
and
baffle
our
comprehension
?
<EOS>
or
were
you
nearer
home
than
we
expected
,
and
received
the
news
of
your
father
's
demise
through
some
channel
unknown
to
us
?
<EOS>
Satisfy
my
curiosity
,
I
beg
of
you
,
upon
this
point
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
curiosity
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
replied
Ranulph
,
gravely
and
sadly
,
"
will
not
be
decreased
,
when
I
tell
you
,
that
my
return
has
neither
been
the
work
of
chance,—for
<EOS>
I
came
,
fully
anticipating
the
dread
event
,
which
I
find
realized,—nor
<EOS>
has
it
been
occasioned
by
any
intelligence
derived
from
yourself
,
or
others
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
,
indeed
,
upon
my
arrival
here
that
I
received
full
confirmation
of
my
apprehensions
.
<EOS>
I
had
another
,
a
more
terrible
summons
to
return
.
<EOS>
""What
summons
?
<EOS>
you
perplex
me
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Small
,
gazing
with
some
misgiving
into
the
face
of
his
young
friend
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
am
myself
perplexed
—
sorely
perplexed
,
"
returned
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
much
to
relate
;
but
I
pray
you
bear
with
me
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
I
have
that
on
my
mind
which
,
like
guilt
,
must
be
revealed
.
<EOS>
""Speak
,
then
,
fearlessly
to
me
,
"
said
Small
,
affectionately
pressing
Ranulph
's
hand
,
"
and
assure
yourself
,
beforehand
,
of
my
sympathy
.
<EOS>
""It
will
be
necessary
,
"
said
Ranulph
,
"
to
preface
my
narrative
by
some
slight
allusion
to
certain
painful
events
—
<EOS>
and
yet
I
know
<EOS>
not
why
I
should
call
them
painful
,
excepting
in
their
consequences
—
which
influenced
my
conduct
in
my
final
interview
between
my
father
and
myself
—
an
interview
which
occasioned
my
departure
for
the
Continent
—
and
which
was
of
a
character
so
dreadful
,
that
I
would
not
even
revert
to
it
,
were
it
not
a
necessary
preliminary
to
the
circumstance
I
am
about
to
detail
.
<EOS>
"When
<EOS>
I
left
Oxford
<EOS>
,
I
passed
a
few
weeks
alone
,
in
London
.
<EOS>
A
college
friend
,
whom
I
accidentally
met
,
introduced
me
,
during
a
promenade
in
St.
James
's
Park
,
to
some
acquaintances
of
his
own
,
who
were
taking
an
airing
in
the
Mall
at
the
same
time
—
a
family
whose
name
was
Mowbray
,
consisting
of
a
widow
lady
,
her
son
,
and
daughter
.
<EOS>
This
introduction
was
made
in
compliance
with
my
own
request
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
struck
by
the
singular
beauty
of
the
younger
lady
,
whose
countenance
had
a
peculiar
and
inexpressible
charm
to
me
,
from
its
marked
resemblance
to
the
portrait
of
the
Lady
Eleanor
Rookwood
,
whose
charms
and
unhappy
fate
<EOS>
I
have
so
often
dwelt
upon
and
deplored
.
<EOS>
The
picture
is
there
,
"
continued
Ranulph
,
pointing
to
it
:
<EOS>
"
look
at
it
,
and
you
have
the
fair
creature
I
speak
of
before
you
;
the
color
of
the
hair
—
the
tenderness
of
the
eyes
.
<EOS>
No
—
the
expression
is
not
so
sad
,
except
when
——
but
no
matter
!
<EOS>
I
recognized
her
features
at
once
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
struck
me
,
that
upon
the
mention
of
my
name
,
the
party
betrayed
some
surprise
,
especially
the
elder
lady
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
was
so
attracted
by
the
beauty
of
the
daughter
,
the
effect
of
which
upon
me
seemed
rather
the
fulfilment
of
a
predestined
event
,
originating
in
the
strange
fascination
which
the
family
portrait
had
wrought
in
my
heart
,
than
the
operation
of
what
is
called
'
love
at
first
sight
,
'
that
I
was
insensible
to
the
agitation
of
the
mother
.
<EOS>
In
vain
I
endeavored
to
rally
myself
;
my
efforts
at
conversation
were
fruitless
;
I
could
not
talk
—
all
I
could
do
was
silently
to
yield
to
the
soft
witchery
of
those
tender
eyes
;
my
admiration
increasing
each
instant
that
I
gazed
upon
them
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
accompanied
them
home
.
<EOS>
Attracted
as
by
some
irresistible
spell
,
I
could
not
tear
myself
away
;
so
that
,
although
I
fancied
I
could
perceive
symptoms
of
displeasure
in
the
looks
of
both
the
mother
and
the
son
,
yet
,
regardless
of
consequences
,
I
ventured
,
uninvited
,
to
enter
the
house
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
shake
off
the
restraint
which
I
felt
my
society
imposed
,
I
found
it
absolutely
necessary
to
divest
myself
of
bashfulness
,
and
to
exert
such
conversational
powers
as
I
possessed
.
<EOS>
I
succeeded
so
well
that
the
discourse
soon
became
lively
and
animated
;
and
what
chiefly
delighted
me
was
,
that
she
,
for
whose
sake
I
had
committed
my
present
rudeness
,
became
radiant
with
smiles
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
all
eagerness
to
seek
for
some
explanation
of
the
resemblance
to
which
I
have
just
alluded
,
and
the
fitting
moment
had
,
I
conceived
,
arrived
.
<EOS>
I
called
attention
to
a
peculiar
expression
in
the
features
of
Miss
Mowbray
,
and
then
instanced
the
likeness
that
subsisted
between
her
and
my
ancestress
.
'
<EOS>
It
is
the
more
singular
,
'
I
said
,
turning
to
her
mother
,
'
because
there
could
have
been
no
affinity
,
that
I
am
aware
of
,
between
them
,
and
yet
the
likeness
is
really
surprising
.
<EOS>
'—'It
is
not
so
singular
as
you
imagine
,
'
answered
Mrs.
Mowbray
;
'
there
is
a
close
affinity
.
<EOS>
That
Lady
Rookwood
was
my
mother
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
Mowbray
does
resemble
her
ill
-
fated
ancestress
.
<EOS>
'"Words
can
not
paint
my
astonishment
.
<EOS>
I
gazed
at
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
considering
whether
I
had
not
misconstrued
her
speech
—
whether
I
had
not
so
shaped
the
sounds
as
to
suit
my
own
quick
and
passionate
conceptions
.
<EOS>
But
no
!
<EOS>
I
read
in
her
calm
,
collected
countenance
—
in
the
downcast
glance
,
and
sudden
sadness
of
Eleanor
,
as
well
as
in
the
changed
and
haughty
demeanor
of
the
brother
,
that
I
had
heard
her
rightly
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
Mowbray
was
my
cousin
—
the
descendant
of
that
hapless
creature
whose
image
I
had
almost
worshipped
.
<EOS>
"Recovering
<EOS>
from
my
surprise
,
I
addressed
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
endeavoring
to
excuse
my
ignorance
of
our
relationship
,
on
the
plea
that
I
had
not
been
given
to
understand
that
such
had
been
the
name
of
the
gentleman
she
had
espoused
.
'
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
,
'
answered
she
,
'
the
name
he
bore
at
Rookwood
;
circumstances
forbade
it
then
.
<EOS>
From
the
hour
I
quitted
that
house
until
this
moment
,
excepting
one
interview
with
my
—
with
Sir
Reginald
Rookwood
<EOS>
—
I
have
seen
none
of
my
family
—
have
held
no
communication
with
them
.
<EOS>
My
brothers
have
been
strangers
to
me
;
the
very
name
of
Rookwood
has
been
unheard
,
unknown
;
nor
would
you
have
been
admitted
here
,
had
not
accident
occasioned
it
.
'
<EOS>
I
ventured
now
to
interrupt
her
,
and
to
express
a
hope
that
she
would
suffer
an
acquaintance
to
be
kept
up
,
which
had
so
fortunately
commenced
,
and
which
might
most
probably
bring
about
an
entire
reconciliation
between
the
families
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
earnest
in
my
expostulations
,
my
whole
soul
being
in
them
,
that
she
inclined
a
more
friendly
ear
to
me
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
too
,
smiled
encouragement
.
<EOS>
Love
lent
me
eloquence
;
and
at
length
,
as
a
token
of
my
success
,
and
her
own
relenting
,
Mrs.
Mowbray
held
forth
her
hand
:
I
clasped
it
eagerly
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
happiest
moment
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
"I
will
not
trouble
you
with
any
lengthened
description
of
Eleanor
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
at
some
period
or
other
,
you
may
still
be
enabled
to
see
her
,
and
judge
for
yourself
;
for
though
adverse
circumstances
have
hitherto
conspired
to
separate
us
,
<EOS>
the
time
for
a
renewal
of
our
acquaintance
is
approaching
,
I
trust
,
for
I
am
not
yet
altogether
without
hope
.
<EOS>
But
this
much
I
may
be
allowed
to
say
,
that
her
rare
endowments
of
person
were
only
equalled
by
the
graces
of
her
mind
.
<EOS>
"Educated
<EOS>
abroad
,
she
had
all
the
vivacity
of
our
livelier
neighbors
,
combined
with
every
solid
qualification
which
we
claim
as
more
essentially
our
own
.
<EOS>
Her
light
and
frolic
manner
was
French
,
certainly
;
but
her
gentle
,
sincere
heart
was
as
surely
English
.
<EOS>
The
foreign
accent
that
dwelt
upon
her
tongue
communicated
an
inexpressible
charm
,
even
to
the
language
which
she
spoke
.
<EOS>
"I
will
not
dwell
too
long
upon
this
theme
.
<EOS>
I
feel
ashamed
of
my
own
prolixity
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
am
sure
you
will
pardon
it
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
those
bright
brief
days
!
<EOS>
too
quickly
were
they
fled
!
<EOS>
I
could
expatiate
upon
each
minute
—
recall
each
word
—
revive
each
look
.
<EOS>
It
may
not
be
.
<EOS>
I
must
hasten
on
.
<EOS>
Darker
themes
await
me
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
love
made
rapid
progress
—
I
became
each
hour
more
enamored
of
my
new
-
found
cousin
.
<EOS>
My
whole
time
was
passed
near
her
;
indeed
,
I
could
scarcely
exist
in
absence
from
her
side
.
<EOS>
Short
,
however
,
was
destined
to
be
my
indulgence
in
this
blissful
state
.
<EOS>
One
happy
week
was
its
extent
.
<EOS>
I
received
a
peremptory
summons
from
my
father
to
return
home
.
<EOS>
"Immediately
<EOS>
upon
commencing
this
acquaintance
,
I
had
written
to
my
father
,
explaining
every
particular
attending
it
.
<EOS>
This
I
should
have
done
of
my
own
free
will
,
but
I
was
urged
to
it
by
Mrs.
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
Unaccustomed
to
disguise
,
I
had
expatiated
upon
the
beauty
of
Eleanor
,
and
in
such
terms
,
I
fear
,
that
I
excited
some
uneasiness
in
his
breast
.
<EOS>
His
letter
was
laconic
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
allusion
to
the
subject
upon
which
I
had
expatiated
when
writing
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
commanded
me
to
return
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
bitter
hour
was
at
hand
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
hesitate
to
comply
.
<EOS>
Without
my
father
's
sanction
,
I
was
assured
Mrs.
Mowbray
would
not
permit
any
continuance
of
my
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Of
Eleanor
's
inclinations
I
fancied
I
had
some
assurance
;
but
without
her
mother
's
consent
,
to
whose
will
she
was
devoted
,
I
felt
,
had
I
even
been
inclined
to
urge
it
,
that
my
suit
was
hopeless
.
<EOS>
The
letter
which
I
had
received
from
my
father
made
me
more
than
doubt
whether
I
should
not
find
him
utterly
adverse
to
my
wishes
.
<EOS>
Agonized
,
therefore
,
with
a
thousand
apprehensions
,
I
presented
myself
on
the
morning
of
my
departure
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
I
made
the
declaration
of
my
passion
to
Eleanor
;
it
was
then
that
every
hope
was
confirmed
,
every
apprehension
realized
.
<EOS>
I
received
from
her
lips
a
confirmation
of
my
fondest
wishes
;
yet
were
those
hopes
blighted
in
the
bud
,
when
I
heard
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
their
consummation
was
dependent
on
the
will
of
two
others
,
whose
assenting
voices
,
she
feared
,
could
never
be
obtained
.
<EOS>
From
Mrs.
Mowbray
I
received
a
more
decided
reply
.
<EOS>
All
her
haughtiness
was
aroused
.
<EOS>
Her
farewell
words
assured
me
,
that
it
was
indifferent
to
her
whether
we
met
again
as
relatives
or
as
strangers
.
<EOS>
Then
was
it
that
the
native
tenderness
of
Eleanor
displayed
itself
,
in
an
outbreak
of
feeling
peculiar
to
a
heart
keenly
sympathetic
as
hers
.
<EOS>
She
saw
my
suffering
—
the
reserve
natural
to
her
sex
gave
way
—
she
flung
herself
into
my
arms
—
and
so
we
parted
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
a
heavy
foreboding
I
returned
to
Rookwood
,
and
,
oppressed
with
the
gloomiest
anticipations
,
endeavored
to
prepare
myself
for
the
worst
.
<EOS>
I
arrived
.
<EOS>
My
reception
was
such
as
I
had
calculated
upon
;
and
,
to
increase
my
distress
,
my
parents
had
been
at
variance
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
pain
you
and
myself
with
any
recital
of
their
disagreement
.
<EOS>
My
mother
had
espoused
my
cause
,
chiefly
,
I
fear
,
with
the
view
of
thwarting
my
poor
father
's
inclinations
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
a
terrible
mood
,
exasperated
by
the
fiery
stimulants
he
had
swallowed
,
which
had
not
indeed
,
drowned
his
reason
,
but
roused
and
inflamed
every
dormant
emotion
to
violence
.
<EOS>
He
was
as
one
insane
.
<EOS>
It
was
evening
when
I
arrived
.
<EOS>
I
would
willingly
have
postponed
the
interview
till
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
.
<EOS>
He
insisted
upon
seeing
me
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
mother
was
present
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
restraint
she
usually
had
over
my
father
,
and
how
she
maintained
it
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
she
had
none
.
<EOS>
He
questioned
me
as
to
every
particular
;
probed
my
secret
soul
;
dragged
forth
every
latent
feeling
,
and
then
thundered
out
his
own
determination
that
Eleanor
never
should
be
bride
of
mine
;
nor
would
he
receive
,
under
his
roof
,
her
mother
,
the
discountenanced
daughter
of
his
father
.
<EOS>
I
endeavored
to
remonstrate
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
deaf
to
my
entreaties
.
<EOS>
My
mother
added
sharp
and
stinging
words
to
my
expostulations
.
'
<EOS>
I
had
her
consent
,
'
she
said
;
'
what
more
was
needed
?
<EOS>
The
lands
were
entailed
.
<EOS>
I
should
at
no
distant
period
be
their
master
,
and
might
then
please
myself
.
'
<EOS>
This
I
mention
in
order
to
give
you
my
father
's
strange
answer
.
<EOS>
"'Have
<EOS>
a
care
,
madam
,
'
replied
he
,
'
and
bridle
your
tongue
;
they
are
entailed
,
'
tis
true
,
but
I
need
not
ask
his
consent
to
cut
off
that
entail
.
<EOS>
Let
him
dare
to
disobey
me
in
this
particular
,
and
I
will
so
divert
the
channel
of
my
wealth
,
that
no
drop
shall
reach
him
.
<EOS>
I
will
—
but
why
threaten?—let
him
do
it
,
and
approve
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
'"On
<EOS>
the
morrow
I
renewed
my
importunities
,
with
no
better
success
.
<EOS>
We
were
alone
.
<EOS>
"'Ranulph
,
'
said
he
,
'
you
waste
time
in
seeking
to
change
my
resolution
.
<EOS>
It
is
unalterable
.
<EOS>
I
have
many
motives
which
influence
me
;
they
are
inexplicable
,
but
imperative
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
Mowbray
never
can
be
yours
.
<EOS>
Forget
her
as
speedily
as
may
be
,
and
I
pledge
myself
,
upon
whomsoever
else
your
choice
may
fix
,
I
will
offer
no
obstacle
.
<EOS>
'"'But
<EOS>
why
,
'
exclaimed
I
,
with
vehemence
,
'
do
you
object
to
one
whom
you
have
never
beheld
?
<EOS>
At
least
,
consent
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
'"'Never
!
'
<EOS>
he
replied
,
'
The
tie
is
sundered
,
and
can
not
be
reunited
;
my
father
bound
me
by
an
oath
never
to
meet
in
friendship
with
my
sister
;
I
will
not
break
my
vow
,
I
will
not
violate
its
conditions
,
even
in
the
second
degree
.
<EOS>
We
never
can
meet
again
.
<EOS>
An
idle
prophecy
which
I
have
heard
has
said
"
that
when
a
Rookwood
shall
marry
a
Rookwood
the
end
of
the
house
draweth
nigh
.
<EOS>
"
That
I
regard
not
.
<EOS>
It
may
have
no
meaning
,
or
it
may
have
much
.
<EOS>
To
me
it
imports
nothing
further
,
than
that
,
if
you
we
<EOS>
d
Eleanor
,
every
acre
I
possess
shall
depart
from
you
.
<EOS>
And
assure
yourself
this
is
no
idle
threat
.
<EOS>
I
can
,
and
will
do
it
.
<EOS>
My
curse
shall
be
your
sole
inheritance
.
<EOS>
'"I
could
not
avoid
making
some
reply
,
representing
to
him
<EOS>
how
unjustifiable
such
a
procedure
was
to
me
,
in
a
case
where
the
happiness
of
my
life
was
at
stake
;
and
how
inconsistent
it
was
with
the
charitable
precepts
of
our
faith
,
to
allow
feelings
of
resentment
to
influence
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
My
remonstrances
,
as
in
the
preceding
meeting
,
were
ineffectual
.
<EOS>
The
more
I
spoke
,
the
more
intemperate
he
grew
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
desisted
,
but
not
before
he
had
ordered
me
to
quit
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
leave
the
neighborhood
,
but
saw
him
again
on
the
same
evening
.
<EOS>
"Our
<EOS>
last
interview
took
place
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
I
then
told
him
that
I
had
determined
to
go
abroad
for
two
years
,
at
the
expiration
of
which
period
I
proposed
returning
to
England
;
trusting
that
his
resolution
might
then
be
changed
,
and
that
he
would
listen
to
my
request
,
for
the
fulfilment
of
which
I
could
never
cease
to
hope
.
<EOS>
Time
,
I
hoped
,
might
befriend
me
.
<EOS>
He
approved
of
my
plan
of
travelling
,
requesting
me
not
to
see
Eleanor
before
I
set
out
;
adding
,
in
a
melancholy
tone—'We
may
never
meet
again
,
Ranulph
,
in
this
life
;
in
that
case
,
farewell
forever
.
<EOS>
Indulge
no
vain
hopes
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
never
can
be
yours
,
but
upon
one
condition
,
and
to
that
you
would
never
consent!'—'Propose
it
!
'
<EOS>
I
cried
;
'
there
is
no
condition
I
could
not
accede
to
.
<EOS>
'—'Rash
boy
!
'
<EOS>
he
replied
,
'
you
know
not
what
you
say
;
that
pledge
you
would
never
fulfil
,
were
I
to
propose
it
to
you
;
but
no
—
<EOS>
should
I
survive
till
you
return
<EOS>
,
you
shall
learn
it
then
—
and
now
,
farewell
.
<EOS>
'—'Speak
<EOS>
now
,
I
beseech
you
!
'
<EOS>
I
exclaimed
;
'
anything
,
everything
—
what
you
will!'—'Say
no
more
,
'
replied
he
,
walking
towards
the
house
;
'
when
you
return
we
will
renew
this
subject
;
farewell
—
perhaps
forever
!
'
<EOS>
His
words
were
prophetic
—
that
parting
was
forever
.
<EOS>
I
remained
in
the
garden
till
nightfall
.
<EOS>
I
saw
my
mother
,
but
he
came
not
again
.
<EOS>
I
quitted
England
without
beholding
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
""Did
<EOS>
you
not
acquaint
her
by
letter
with
what
had
occurred
,
and
your
consequent
intentions
?
"
asked
Small
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
did
,
"
replied
Ranulph
;
"
but
I
received
no
reply
.
<EOS>
My
earliest
inquiries
will
be
directed
to
ascertain
whether
the
family
are
still
in
London
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
question
for
our
consideration
,
whether
I
am
not
justified
in
departing
from
my
father
's
expressed
wishes
,
or
whether
I
should
violate
his
commands
in
so
doing
.
<EOS>
""We
will
discuss
that
point
hereafter
,
"
replied
Small
;
adding
,
as
he
noticed
the
growing
paleness
of
his
companion
,
"
you
are
too
much
exhausted
to
proceed
—
you
had
better
defer
the
remainder
of
your
story
to
a
future
period
.
<EOS>
""No
,
"
replied
Ranulph
,
swallowing
a
glass
of
water
;
"
I
am
exhausted
,
yet
I
can
not
rest
—
my
blood
is
in
a
fever
,
which
nothing
will
allay
.
<EOS>
I
shall
feel
more
easy
when
I
have
made
the
present
communication
.
<EOS>
I
am
approaching
the
sequel
of
my
narrative
.
<EOS>
You
are
now
in
possession
of
the
story
of
my
love
—
of
the
motive
of
my
departure
.
<EOS>
You
shall
learn
what
was
the
occasion
of
my
return
.
<EOS>
"I
had
wandered
from
city
to
city
during
my
term
of
exile
—
consumed
by
hopeless
passion
—
with
little
that
could
amuse
me
,
though
surrounded
by
a
thousand
objects
of
interest
to
others
,
and
only
rendering
life
endurable
by
severest
study
or
most
active
exertion
.
<EOS>
My
steps
conducted
me
to
Bordeaux;—there
<EOS>
I
made
a
long
halt
,
enchanted
by
the
beauty
of
the
neighboring
scenery
.
<EOS>
My
fancy
was
smitten
by
the
situation
of
a
villa
on
the
banks
of
the
Garonne
,
within
a
few
leagues
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
old
château
,
with
fine
gardens
bordering
the
blue
waters
of
the
river
,
and
commanding
a
multitude
of
enchanting
prospects
.
<EOS>
The
house
,
which
had
in
part
gone
to
decay
,
was
inhabited
by
an
aged
couple
,
who
had
formerly
been
servants
to
an
English
family
,
the
members
of
which
had
thus
provided
for
them
on
their
return
to
their
own
country
.
<EOS>
I
inquired
the
name
.
<EOS>
Conceive
my
astonishment
to
find
that
this
château
had
been
the
residence
of
the
Mowbrays
.
<EOS>
This
intelligence
decided
me
at
once
—
I
took
up
my
abode
in
the
house
;
and
a
new
and
unexpected
source
of
solace
and
delight
was
opened
to
me
<EOS>
,
I
traced
the
paths
she
had
traced
;
occupied
the
room
she
had
occupied
;
tended
the
flowers
she
had
tended
;
and
,
on
the
golden
summer
evenings
,
would
watch
the
rapid
waters
,
tinged
with
all
the
glorious
hues
of
sunset
,
sweeping
past
my
feet
,
and
think
how
she
had
watched
them
.
<EOS>
Her
presence
seemed
to
pervade
the
place
.
<EOS>
I
was
now
comparatively
happy
,
and
,
anxious
to
remain
unmolested
,
wrote
home
that
I
was
leaving
Bordeaux
for
the
Pyrenees
,
on
my
way
to
Spain
.
<EOS>
""That
account
arrived
,
"
observed
Small
.
<EOS>
"One
<EOS>
night
,
"
continued
Ranulph—"'tis
now
the
sixth
since
the
occurrence
I
am
about
to
relate
—
I
was
seated
in
a
bower
that
overlooked
the
river
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
a
lovely
evening
—
<EOS>
so
lovely
,
that
I
lingered
there
,
wrapped
in
the
heavenly
contemplation
of
its
beauties
.
<EOS>
I
watched
each
rosy
tint
reflected
upon
the
surface
of
the
rapid
stream
—
now
fading
into
yellow
—
now
shining
silvery
white
.
<EOS>
I
noticed
the
mystic
mingling
of
twilight
with
darkness
—
of
night
with
day
,
till
the
bright
current
on
a
sudden
became
a
black
mass
of
waters
.
<EOS>
I
could
scarcely
discern
a
leaf
—
all
was
darkness
—
when
lo
!
<EOS>
another
change
!
<EOS>
The
moon
was
up
—
a
flood
of
light
deluged
all
around
—
the
stream
was
dancing
again
in
reflected
radiance
,
and
I
still
lingering
at
its
brink
.
<EOS>
"I
had
been
musing
for
some
moments
,
with
my
head
resting
upon
my
hand
,
when
,
happening
to
raise
my
eyes
,
I
beheld
a
figure
immediately
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
astonished
at
the
sight
,
for
I
had
perceived
no
one
approach
—
had
heard
no
footstep
advance
towards
me
,
and
was
satisfied
that
no
one
besides
myself
could
be
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
The
presence
of
the
figure
inspired
me
with
an
undefinable
awe
!
<EOS>
and
,
I
can
scarce
tell
why
,
but
a
thrilling
presentiment
convinced
me
that
it
was
a
supernatural
visitant
.
<EOS>
Without
motion
—
without
life
—
without
substance
,
it
seemed
;
yet
still
the
outward
character
of
life
was
there
.
<EOS>
I
started
to
my
feet
.
<EOS>
God
!
<EOS>
what
did
I
behold
?
<EOS>
The
face
was
turned
to
me
—
my
father
's
face
!
<EOS>
And
what
an
aspect
,
what
a
look
!
<EOS>
Time
can
never
efface
that
terrible
expression
;
it
is
graven
upon
my
memory
—
I
can
not
describe
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
anger
—
it
was
not
pain
:
it
was
as
if
an
eternity
of
woe
were
stamped
upon
its
features
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
dreadful
to
behold
,
I
would
fain
have
averted
my
gaze
—
<EOS>
my
eyes
were
fascinated
—
fixed
<EOS>
—
I
could
not
withdraw
them
from
the
ghastly
countenance
.
<EOS>
I
shrank
from
it
,
yet
stirred
not
—
I
could
not
move
a
limb
.
<EOS>
Noiselessly
gliding
towards
me
,
the
apparition
approached
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
retreat
.
<EOS>
It
stood
obstinately
beside
me
.
<EOS>
I
became
as
one
half
-
dead
.
<EOS>
The
phantom
shook
its
head
with
the
deepest
despair
;
and
as
the
word
'
Return
!
'
<EOS>
sounded
hollowly
in
my
ears
,
it
gradually
melted
from
my
view
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
how
I
recovered
from
the
swoon
into
which
I
fell
,
but
daybreak
saw
me
on
my
way
to
England
.
<EOS>
I
am
here
.
<EOS>
On
that
night
—
at
that
same
hour
,
my
father
died
.
<EOS>
""It
was
,
after
all
,
then
,
a
supernatural
summons
that
you
received
?
"
said
Small
.
<EOS>
"Undoubtedly
,
"
replied
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"Humph!—the
coincidence
,
I
own
,
is
sufficiently
curious
,
"
returned
Small
,
musingly
;
"
but
it
would
not
be
difficult
,
I
think
,
to
discover
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
delusion
.
<EOS>
""There
was
no
delusion
,
"
replied
Ranulph
,
coldly
;
"
the
figure
was
as
palpable
as
your
own
.
<EOS>
Can
I
doubt
,
when
I
behold
this
result
?
<EOS>
Could
any
deceit
have
been
practised
upon
me
,
at
that
distance?—the
precise
time
,
moreover
,
agreeing
.
<EOS>
Did
not
the
phantom
bid
me
return?—I
have
returned
—
he
is
dead
.
<EOS>
I
have
gazed
upon
a
being
of
another
world
.
<EOS>
To
doubt
were
impious
,
after
that
look
.
<EOS>
""Whatever
<EOS>
my
opinions
may
be
,
my
dear
young
friend
,
"
returned
Small
,
gravely
,
"
I
will
suspend
them
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
You
are
still
greatly
excited
.
<EOS>
Let
me
advise
you
to
seek
some
repose
.
<EOS>
""I
am
easier
,
"
replied
Ranulph
;
"
but
you
are
right
,
I
will
endeavor
to
snatch
a
little
rest
.
<EOS>
Something
within
tells
me
all
is
not
yet
accomplished
.
<EOS>
What
remains?—I
shudder
to
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
rejoin
you
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
I
shall
myself
attend
the
solemnity
.
<EOS>
Adieu!"Ranulph
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
Small
sighingly
shook
his
head
,
and
having
lighted
his
pipe
,
was
presently
buried
in
a
profundity
of
smoke
and
metaphysical
speculation
.

THE
progress
of
our
narrative
demands
our
presence
in
another
apartment
of
the
hall
—
a
large
,
lonesome
chamber
,
situate
in
the
eastern
wing
of
the
house
,
already
described
as
the
most
ancient
part
of
the
building
—
<EOS>
the
sombre
appearance
of
which
was
greatly
increased
by
the
dingy
,
discolored
tapestry
that
clothed
its
walls
;
the
record
of
the
patience
and
industry
of
a
certain
Dame
Dorothy
Rookwood
,
who
flourished
some
centuries
ago
,
and
whose
skilful
needle
had
illustrated
the
slaughter
of
the
Innocents
,
with
a
severity
of
gusto
,
and
sanguinary
minuteness
of
detail
,
truly
surprising
in
a
lady
so
amiable
as
she
was
represented
to
have
been
.
<EOS>
Grim
-
visaged
Herod
glared
from
the
ghostly
woof
,
with
his
shadowy
legions
,
executing
their
murderous
purposes
,
grouped
like
a
troop
of
Sabbath
-
dancing
witches
around
him
.
<EOS>
Mysterious
twilight
,
admitted
through
the
deep
,
dark
,
mullioned
windows
,
revealed
the
antique
furniture
of
the
room
,
which
still
boasted
a
sort
of
mildewed
splendor
,
more
imposing
,
perhaps
,
than
its
original
gaudy
magnificence
;
and
showed
the
lofty
hangings
,
and
tall
,
hearse
-
like
canopy
of
a
bedstead
,
once
a
couch
of
state
,
but
now
destined
for
the
repose
of
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
The
stiff
crimson
hangings
were
embroidered
in
gold
,
with
the
arms
and
cipher
of
Elizabeth
,
from
whom
the
apartment
,
having
once
been
occupied
by
that
sovereign
,
obtained
the
name
of
the
"
Queen
's
Room
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
sole
tenant
of
this
chamber
was
a
female
,
in
whose
countenance
,
if
time
and
strong
emotion
had
written
strange
defeatures
,
they
had
not
obliterated
its
striking
beauty
and
classical
grandeur
of
expression
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
face
majestical
and
severe
.
<EOS>
Pride
was
stamped
in
all
its
lines
;
and
though
each
passion
was
,
by
turns
,
developed
,
it
was
evident
that
all
were
subordinate
to
the
sin
by
which
the
angels
fell
.
<EOS>
The
contour
of
her
face
was
formed
in
the
purest
Grecian
mould
,
and
might
have
been
a
model
for
Medea
;
so
well
did
the
gloomy
grandeur
of
the
brow
,
the
severe
chiselling
of
the
lip
,
the
rounded
beauty
of
the
throat
,
and
the
faultless
symmetry
of
her
full
form
,
accord
with
the
beau
ideal
of
antique
perfection
.
<EOS>
Shaded
by
smooth
folds
of
raven
hair
,
which
still
maintained
its
jetty
dye
,
her
lofty
forehead
would
have
been
displayed
to
the
greatest
advantage
,
had
it
not
been
at
this
moment
knit
and
deformed
by
excess
of
passion
,
if
that
passion
can
be
said
to
deform
which
only
calls
forth
strong
and
vehement
expression
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
,
which
wanted
only
height
to
give
it
dignity
,
was
arrayed
in
the
garb
of
widowhood
;
and
if
she
exhibited
none
of
the
desolation
of
heart
which
such
a
bereavement
might
have
been
expected
to
awaken
,
she
was
evidently
a
prey
to
feelings
scarcely
less
harrowing
.
<EOS>
At
the
particular
time
of
which
we
speak
,
Lady
Rookwood
,
for
she
it
was
,
was
occupied
in
the
investigation
of
the
contents
of
an
escritoire
.
<EOS>
Examining
the
papers
which
it
contained
with
great
deliberation
,
she
threw
each
aside
,
as
soon
as
she
had
satisfied
herself
of
its
purport
,
until
she
arrived
at
a
little
package
,
carefully
tied
up
with
black
ribbon
,
and
sealed
.
<EOS>
This
,
Lady
Rookwood
hastily
broke
open
,
and
drew
forth
a
small
miniature
.
<EOS>
It
was
that
of
a
female
,
young
and
beautiful
,
rudely
,
yet
faithfully
,
executed
—
faithfully
,
we
say
,
for
there
was
an
air
of
sweetness
and
simplicity
—
and
,
in
short
,
a
look
of
reality
and
nature
about
the
picture
(
it
is
seldom
,
indeed
,
that
we
mistake
a
likeness
,
even
if
we
are
unacquainted
with
the
original
)
<EOS>
that
attested
the
artist
's
fidelity
.
<EOS>
The
face
was
as
radiant
with
smiles
as
a
bright
day
with
sunbeams
.
<EOS>
The
portrait
was
set
in
gold
,
and
behind
it
was
looped
a
lock
of
the
darkest
and
finest
hair
.
<EOS>
Underneath
the
miniature
was
written
,
in
Sir
Piers
's
hand
,
the
words
"
Lady
Rookwood
.
"
<EOS>
A
slip
of
folded
paper
was
also
attached
to
it
.
<EOS>
Lady
Rookwood
scornfully
scrutinized
the
features
for
a
few
moments
,
and
then
unfolded
the
paper
,
at
the
sight
of
which
she
started
,
and
turned
pale
.
"
<EOS>
Thank
God
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
"
this
is
in
my
possession
—
while
I
hold
this
,
we
are
safe
.
<EOS>
Were
it
not
better
to
destroy
this
evidence
at
once
?
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
not
now
—
it
shall
not
part
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
abide
Ranulph
's
return
.
<EOS>
This
document
will
give
me
a
power
over
him
such
as
I
could
never
otherwise
obtain
.
<EOS>
"
Placing
the
marriage
certificate
,
for
such
it
was
,
within
her
breast
,
and
laying
the
miniature
upon
the
table
,
she
next
proceeded
,
deliberately
,
to
arrange
the
disordered
contents
of
the
box
.
<EOS>
All
outward
traces
of
emotion
had
,
ere
this
,
become
so
subdued
in
Lady
Rookwood
,
that
although
she
had
,
only
a
few
moments
previously
,
exhibited
the
extremity
of
passionate
indignation
,
she
now
,
apparently
without
effort
,
resumed
entire
composure
,
and
might
have
been
supposed
to
be
engaged
in
a
matter
of
little
interest
to
herself
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
dread
calm
,
which
they
who
knew
her
would
have
trembled
to
behold
.
<EOS>
"
From
these
letters
I
gather
,
"
exclaimed
she
,
"
that
their
wretched
offspring
knows
not
of
his
fortune
.
<EOS>
So
far
,
well
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
channel
whence
he
can
derive
information
,
and
my
first
care
shall
be
to
prevent
his
obtaining
any
clue
to
the
secret
of
his
birth
.
<EOS>
I
am
directed
to
provide
for
him
—
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
I
will
provide
—
a
grave
!
<EOS>
There
will
I
bury
him
and
his
secret
.
<EOS>
My
son
's
security
and
my
own
wrong
demand
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
choose
surer
hands
—
the
work
must
not
be
half
-
done
,
as
heretofore
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
I
bethink
me
,
he
is
in
the
neighborhood
,
connected
with
a
gang
of
poachers—'tis
as
I
could
wish
it
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
a
knock
at
the
chamber
-
door
broke
upon
her
meditations
.
<EOS>
"
Agnes
,
is
it
you
?
"
demanded
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
Thus
summoned
,
the
old
attendant
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
are
my
orders
disobeyed
?
"
asked
the
lady
,
in
a
severe
tone
of
voice
.
<EOS>
"
Did
I
not
say
,
when
you
delivered
me
this
package
from
Mr.
Coates
,
which
he
himself
wished
to
present
,
that
I
would
not
be
<EOS>
disturbed?""You
did
,
my
lady
,
but——""Speak
out
,
"
said
Lady
Rookwood
,
somewhat
more
mildly
,
perceiving
,
from
Agnes
's
manner
,
that
she
had
something
of
importance
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
brings
you
hither?""I
am
sorry
,
"
returned
Agnes
,
"
to
disturb
your
ladyship
,
but
<EOS>
—
but——""But
what
?
<EOS>
"
interrupted
Lady
Rookwood
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"I
could
not
help
it
,
my
lady
—
he
would
have
me
come
;
he
said
he
was
resolved
to
see
your
ladyship
,
whether
you
would
or
not
.
<EOS>
""Would
<EOS>
see
me
,
ha
!
<EOS>
is
it
so
?
<EOS>
I
guess
his
errand
,
and
its
object
—
he
has
some
suspicion
.
<EOS>
No
,
that
can
not
be
;
he
would
not
dare
to
tamper
with
these
seals
.
<EOS>
Agnes
,
I
will
not
see
him
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
he
swears
,
my
lady
,
that
he
will
not
leave
the
house
without
seeing
you
—
he
would
have
forced
his
way
into
your
presence
,
if
I
had
not
consented
to
announce
him
.
<EOS>
""Insolent
!
"
exclaimed
Lady
Rookwood
,
with
a
glance
of
indignation
;
"
force
his
way
!
<EOS>
I
promise
you
he
shall
not
display
an
equal
anxiety
to
repeat
the
visit
.
<EOS>
Tell
Mr.
Coates
I
will
see
him
.
<EOS>
""Mr
.
<EOS>
Coates
!
<EOS>
Mercy
on
us
,
my
lady
,
it
's
not
he
.
<EOS>
He
'd
never
have
intruded
upon
you
unasked
.
<EOS>
No
such
thing
.
<EOS>
He
knows
his
place
too
well
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
<EOS>
;
it
's
not
Mr.
Coates——""If
<EOS>
not
he
,
who
is
it?""Luke
Bradley
;
your
ladyship
knows
whom
I
mean
.
<EOS>
""He
here
—
now?——""Yes
,
my
lady
;
and
looking
so
fierce
and
strange
,
I
was
quite
frightened
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
looked
so
like
his
—
his——""His
father
,
you
would
say
.
<EOS>
Speak
out
.
<EOS>
""No
,
my
lady
,
his
grandfather
—
old
Sir
Reginald
.
<EOS>
He
's
the
very
image
of
him
.
<EOS>
But
had
not
your
ladyship
better
ring
the
alarm
-
bell
?
<EOS>
and
when
he
comes
in
,
I
'll
run
and
fetch
the
servants
<EOS>
—
he
's
dangerous
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
fears
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
will
see
me
,
you
say——""Ay
,
will
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Luke
,
as
he
threw
open
the
door
,
and
shut
it
forcibly
after
him
,
striding
towards
Lady
Rookwood
,
"
nor
abide
longer
delay
.
<EOS>
"It
was
an
instant
or
two
ere
Lady
Rookwood
,
thus
taken
by
surprise
,
could
command
speech
.
<EOS>
She
fixed
her
eyes
with
a
look
of
keen
and
angry
inquiry
upon
the
bold
intruder
,
who
,
nothing
daunted
,
confronted
her
glances
with
a
gaze
as
stern
and
steadfast
as
her
own
.
"Who
<EOS>
are
you
,
and
what
seek
you
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Lady
Rookwood
,
after
a
brief
pause
,
and
,
in
spite
of
herself
,
her
voice
sounded
tremulously
.
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
have
,
that
you
venture
to
appear
before
me
at
this
season
and
in
this
fashion?""I
might
have
chosen
a
fitter
opportunity
,
"
returned
Luke
,
"
were
it
needed
.
<EOS>
My
business
will
not
brook
delay
—
you
must
be
pleased
to
overlook
this
intrusion
on
your
privacy
,
at
a
season
of
sorrow
like
the
present
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
fashion
of
my
visit
,
you
must
be
content
to
excuse
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
myself
.
<EOS>
I
may
amend
hereafter
.
<EOS>
Who
I
am
,
you
are
able
,
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
,
to
divine
.
<EOS>
What
I
seek
,
you
shall
hear
,
when
this
old
woman
has
left
the
room
,
unless
you
would
have
a
witness
to
a
declaration
that
concerns
you
as
nearly
as
myself
.
<EOS>
"An
<EOS>
indefinite
feeling
of
apprehension
had
,
from
the
first
instant
of
Luke
's
entrance
crossed
Lady
Rookwood
's
mind
.
<EOS>
She
,
however
,
answered
,
with
some
calmness:"What
<EOS>
you
can
have
to
say
is
of
small
moment
to
me
—
nor
does
it
signify
who
may
hear
it
.
<EOS>
It
shall
not
,
however
,
be
said
that
Lady
Rookwood
feared
to
be
alone
,
even
though
she
endangered
her
life
.
<EOS>
""I
am
no
assassin
,
"
replied
Luke
,
"
nor
have
sought
the
destruction
of
my
deadliest
foe
—
though
'
twere
but
retributive
justice
to
have
done
so
.
<EOS>
"Lady
<EOS>
Rookwood
started
.
<EOS>
"Nay
,
you
need
not
fear
me
,
"
replied
Luke
;
"
my
revenge
will
be
otherwise
accomplished
.
<EOS>
""Go
,
"
said
Lady
Rookwood
to
Agnes
;
"
yet
—
stay
without
,
in
the
antechamber
.
<EOS>
""My
lady
,
"
said
Agnes
,
scarcely
able
to
articulate
,
"
shall
I——""Hear
<EOS>
me
,
Lady
Rookwood
,
"
interrupted
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
,
I
intend
you
no
injury
.
<EOS>
My
object
here
is
solely
to
obtain
a
private
conference
.
<EOS>
You
can
have
no
reason
for
denying
me
this
request
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
abuse
your
patience
.
<EOS>
Mine
is
no
idle
mission
.
<EOS>
Say
you
refuse
me
,
and
I
will
at
once
depart
.
<EOS>
I
will
find
other
means
of
communicating
with
you
—
less
direct
,
and
therefore
less
desirable
.
<EOS>
Make
your
election
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
be
alone
—
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
Summon
your
household
—
let
them
lay
hands
upon
me
,
and
I
will
proclaim
aloud
what
you
would
gladly
hide
,
even
from
yourself
.
<EOS>
""Leave
<EOS>
us
,
Agnes
,
"
said
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
fear
of
this
man
.
<EOS>
I
can
deal
with
him
myself
,
should
I
see
occasion
.
<EOS>
""Agnes
,
"
said
Luke
,
in
a
stern
,
deep
whisper
,
arresting
the
ancient
handmaiden
as
she
passed
him
,
"
stir
not
from
the
door
till
I
come
forth
.
<EOS>
Have
you
forgotten
your
former
mistress!—my
mother
?
<EOS>
Have
you
forgotten
Barbara
Lovel
,
and
that
night?""In
<EOS>
Heaven
's
name
,
hush
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Agnes
,
with
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
that
be
fresh
in
your
memory
.
<EOS>
Move
not
a
footstep
,
whatever
you
may
hear
,
"
added
he
,
in
the
same
tone
as
before
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
will
not
—
I
will
not
.
"
<EOS>
And
Agnes
departed
.
<EOS>
Luke
felt
some
wavering
in
his
resolution
when
he
found
himself
alone
with
the
lady
,
whose
calm
,
collected
,
yet
haughty
demeanor
,
as
she
resumed
her
seat
,
prepared
for
his
communication
,
could
not
fail
to
inspire
him
with
a
certain
degree
of
awe
.
<EOS>
Not
unconscious
of
her
advantage
,
nor
slow
to
profit
by
it
,
Lady
Rookwood
remained
perfectly
silent
,
with
her
eyes
steadily
fixed
upon
his
face
,
while
his
embarrassment
momentarily
increased
.
<EOS>
Summoning
,
at
length
,
courage
sufficient
to
address
her
,
and
ashamed
of
his
want
of
nerve
,
he
thus
broke
forth:"When
<EOS>
I
entered
this
room
<EOS>
,
you
asked
my
name
and
object
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
first
,
I
answer
to
the
same
designation
as
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
I
have
long
borne
my
mother
's
name
.
<EOS>
I
now
claim
my
father
's
.
<EOS>
My
object
is
,
the
restitution
of
my
rights
.
<EOS>
""Soh!—it
is
as
I
suspected
,
"
thought
Lady
Rookwood
,
involuntarily
casting
her
large
eyes
down
.
<EOS>
"
Do
I
hear
you
rightly
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
she
,
aloud
;
"
your
name
is——""Sir
Luke
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
As
my
father
's
elder
born
;
by
right
of
hisright
to
that
title
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
a
glance
could
have
slain
him
,
Luke
had
fallen
lifeless
at
the
lady
's
feet
.
<EOS>
With
a
smile
of
ineffable
disdain
,
she
replied
,
"
I
know
not
why
I
hesitate
to
resent
this
indignity
,
even
for
an
instant
.
<EOS>
But
I
would
see
how
far
your
audacity
will
carry
you
.
<EOS>
The
name
you
bear
is
Bradley?""In
ignorance
I
have
done
so
,
"
replied
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
son
of
her
whose
maiden
name
was
Bradley
.
<EOS>
She
was——""'Tis
false
<EOS>
—
I
will
not
hear
it
—
she
was
not
,
"
cried
Lady
Rookwood
,
her
vehemence
getting
the
master
of
her
prudence
.
<EOS>
"Your
ladyship
anticipates
my
meaning
,
"
returned
Luke
.
"
<EOS>
Susan
Bradley
was
the
first
wife
of
Sir
Piers
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
""His
minion
—
his
mistress
if
you
will
;
nought
else
.
<EOS>
Is
it
new
to
you
,
that
a
village
wench
,
who
lends
herself
to
shame
,
should
be
beguiled
by
such
shallow
pretences
?
<EOS>
That
she
was
so
duped
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
not
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
too
late
now
to
complain
,
and
I
would
counsel
you
not
to
repeat
your
idle
boast
.
<EOS>
It
will
serve
no
other
purpose
,
trust
me
,
than
to
blazon
forth
your
own
—
your
mother
's
dishonor
.
<EOS>
""Lady
<EOS>
Rookwood
,
"
sternly
answered
Luke
,
"
my
mother
's
fame
is
as
free
from
dishonor
as
your
own
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
,
she
was
the
first
wife
of
Sir
Piers
;
and
that
I
,
her
child
,
am
first
in
the
inheritance
;
nay
,
sole
heir
to
the
estates
and
title
of
Rookwood
,
to
the
exclusion
of
your
son
.
<EOS>
Ponder
upon
that
intelligence
.
<EOS>
Men
say
they
fear
you
,
as
a
thing
of
ill
.
<EOS>
I
fear
you
not
.
<EOS>
There
have
been
days
when
the
Rookwoods
held
their
dames
in
subjection
.
<EOS>
Discern
you
nought
of
that
in
me?"Once
or
twice
during
this
speech
<EOS>
Lady
Rookwood
's
glances
had
wandered
towards
the
bell
-
cord
,
as
if
about
to
summon
aid
;
but
the
intention
was
abandoned
almost
as
soon
as
formed
,
probably
from
apprehension
of
the
consequences
of
any
such
attempt
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
without
alarm
as
to
the
result
of
the
interview
,
and
was
considering
how
she
could
bring
it
to
a
termination
without
endangering
herself
,
and
,
if
possible
,
secure
the
person
of
Luke
,
when
the
latter
,
turning
sharply
round
upon
her
,
and
drawing
a
pistol
,
exclaimed,—"Follow
me!""Whither
?
"
<EOS>
asked
she
,
in
alarm
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
the
chamber
of
death!""Why
there
?
<EOS>
what
would
you
do
?
<EOS>
Villain
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
trust
my
life
with
you

<EOS>
I
will
not
follow
you
.
<EOS>
""Hesitate
<EOS>
not
,
as
you
value
your
life
.
<EOS>
Do
aught
to
alarm
the
house
,
and
I
fire
.
<EOS>
Your
safety
depends
upon
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
would
see
my
father
's
body
ere
it
be
laid
in
the
grave
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
leave
you
here
.
<EOS>
""Go
,
"
said
Lady
Rookwood
;
"
if
that
be
all
,
I
pledge
myself
you
shall
not
be
interrupted
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
take
your
pledge
;
your
presence
shall
be
my
surety
.
<EOS>
By
my
mother
's
unavenged
memory
,
if
you
play
me
false
,
though
all
your
satellites
stand
around
you
,
you
die
upon
the
spot
!
<EOS>
Obey
me
,
and
you
are
safe

<EOS>
Our
way
leads
to
the
room
by
the
private
staircase
—
we
shall
pass
unobserved
—
you
see
I
know
the
road
.
<EOS>
The
room
,
by
your
own
command
,
is
vacant
—
save
of
the
dead
.
<EOS>
We
shall
,
therefore
,
be
alone
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
I
depart
.
<EOS>
You
will
then
be
free
to
act
.
<EOS>
Disobey
me
,
and
your
blood
be
upon
your
own
head
.
<EOS>
""Lead
on
!
"
said
Lady
Rookwood
,
pressing
towards
the
antechamber
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
door
<EOS>
I
mean
is
there
,
"
pointing
to
another
part
of
the
room—"that
panel,—""Ha
!
<EOS>
how
know
you
that?""No
matter
;
follow
.
<EOS>
"Luke
touched
a
spring
,
and
the
panel
flying
open
,
disclosed
a
dim
recess
,
into
which
he
entered
;
and
,
seizing
Lady
Rookwood
's
hand
,
dragged
her
after
him
.

CHAPTER
XII
.
<EOS>
—
THE
CHAMBER
OF
DEATHIt
is
the
body
—
I
have
orders
<EOS>
givenThat
here
it
should
be
laid
.
<EOS>
—
De
Montfort
.
<EOS>
THE
recess
upon
which
the
panel
opened
had
been
a
small
oratory
,
and
,
though
entirely
disused
,
still
retained
its
cushions
and
its
crucifix
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
other
entrances
to
this
place
of
prayer
,
the
one
communicating
with
a
further
bedchamber
,
the
other
leading
to
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
Through
the
latter
,
after
closing
the
aperture
,
without
relinquishing
his
grasp
,
Luke
passed
.
<EOS>
It
was
growing
rapidly
dark
,
and
at
the
brightest
seasons
this
gloomy
corridor
was
but
imperfectly
lighted
from
narrow
,
painted
,
and
wire
-
protected
windows
that
looked
into
the
old
quadrangular
courtyard
below
;
and
as
they
issued
from
the
oratory
a
dazzling
flash
of
lightning
—
a
storm
having
suddenly
arisen
—
momentarily
illumined
the
whole
length
of
the
passage
,
disclosing
the
retreating
figure
of
a
man
,
wrapped
in
a
large
sable
cloak
,
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
Lady
Rookwood
uttered
an
outcry
for
assistance
;
but
the
man
,
whoever
he
might
be
,
disappeared
in
the
instantaneously
succeeding
gloom
,
leaving
her
in
doubt
whether
or
not
her
situation
had
been
perceived
.
<EOS>
Luke
had
seen
this
dark
figure
at
the
same
instant
;
and
,
not
without
apprehensions
lest
his
plans
should
be
defeated
,
he
griped
Lady
Rookwood
's
arm
still
more
strictly
,
and
placing
the
muzzle
of
the
pistol
to
her
breast
,
hurried
her
rapidly
forwards
.
<EOS>
All
was
now
in
total
obscurity
;
the
countenance
of
neither
could
be
perceived
as
they
trod
the
dark
passage
;
but
Luke
's
unrelaxed
grasp
indicated
no
change
in
his
purposes
,
nor
did
the
slow
,
dignified
march
of
the
lady
betray
any
apprehension
on
her
part
.
<EOS>
Descending
a
spiral
staircase
,
which
led
from
the
gallery
to
a
lower
story
,
their
way
now
lay
beneath
the
entrance
-
hall
,
a
means
of
communication
little
used
.
<EOS>
Their
tread
sounded
hollowly
on
the
flagged
floor
;
no
other
sound
was
heard
.
<EOS>
Mounting
a
staircase
,
similar
to
the
one
they
had
just
descended
,
they
arrived
at
another
passage
.
<EOS>
A
few
paces
brought
them
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
Luke
turned
the
handle
,
and
they
stood
within
the
chamber
of
the
dead
.
<EOS>
The
room
which
contained
the
remains
of
poor
Sir
Piers
was
arrayed
in
all
that
mockery
of
state
which
,
vainly
attempting
to
deride
death
,
is
itself
a
bitter
derision
of
the
living
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
one
devoted
to
the
principal
meals
of
the
day
;
a
strange
choice
,
but
convenience
had
dictated
its
adoption
by
those
with
whom
this
part
of
the
ceremonial
had
originated
,
and
long
custom
had
rendered
its
usage
,
for
this
purpose
,
almost
prescriptive
.
<EOS>
This
room
,
which
was
of
some
size
,
had
originally
formed
part
of
the
great
hall
,
from
which
it
was
divided
by
a
thick
screen
of
black
,
lustrously
varnished
oak
,
enriched
with
fanciful
figures
carved
in
bold
relief
.
<EOS>
The
walls
were
panelled
with
the
same
embrowned
material
,
and
sustained
sundry
portraits
of
the
members
of
the
family
,
in
every
possible
costume
,
from
the
steely
gear
of
Sir
Ranulph
,
down
to
the
flowing
attire
of
Sir
Reginald
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
race
were
ranged
around
the
room
;
and
,
seen
in
the
yellow
light
shed
upon
their
features
by
the
flambeaux
,
they
looked
like
an
array
of
stern
and
silent
witnesses
,
gazing
upon
their
departed
descendant
.
<EOS>
The
sides
of
the
chamber
were
hung
with
black
cloth
,
and
upon
a
bier
in
the
middle
of
the
room
rested
the
body
.
<EOS>
Broad
escutcheons
,
decked
out
in
glowing
colors
pompously
set
forth
the
heraldic
honors
of
the
departed
.
<EOS>
Tall
lights
burned
at
the
head
and
feet
,
and
fragrant
perfumes
diffused
their
odors
from
silver
censers
.
<EOS>
The
entrance
of
Luke
and
his
unwilling
companion
had
been
abrupt
.
<EOS>
The
transition
from
darkness
to
the
glare
of
light
was
almost
blinding
,
and
they
had
advanced
far
into
the
room
ere
Lady
Rookwood
perceived
a
man
,
whom
she
took
to
be
one
of
the
mutes
,
leaning
over
the
bier
.
<EOS>
The
coffin
-
lid
was
entirely
removed
,
and
the
person
,
whose
back
was
towards
them
appeared
to
be
wrapped
in
mournful
contemplation
of
the
sad
spectacle
before
him
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
bursting
from
Luke
's
hold
,
Lady
Rookwood
rushed
forward
with
a
scream
,
and
touched
the
man
's
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
started
at
the
summons
,
and
disclosed
the
features
of
her
son!Rapidly
as
her
own
act
,
Luke
followed
.
<EOS>
He
levelled
a
pistol
at
her
head
,
but
his
hand
dropped
to
his
side
as
he
encountered
the
glance
of
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
All
three
seemed
paralyzed
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
,
in
astonishment
,
extended
his
arm
to
his
mother
,
who
,
placing
one
arm
over
his
shoulder
,
pointed
with
the
other
to
Luke
;
the
latter
stared
sternly
and
inquiringly
at
both
—
yet
none
spoke
.

CHAPTER
XIII
.
<EOS>
—
THE
BROTHERS
...
<EOS>
We
're
sorryHis
violent
act
has
e'en
drawn
blood
of
honor
,
And
stained
our
honors;Thrown
ink
upon
the
forehead
of
our
fame
,
Which
envious
spirits
will
dip
their
pens
intoAfter
our
death
,
and
blot
us
in
our
tombs;For
that
which
would
seem
treason
in
our
lives
,
Is
laughter
when
we
're
dead
.
<EOS>
Who
dares
now
whisper
,
That
dares
not
then
speak
out
;
and
even
proclaim
,
With
loud
words
,
and
broad
pens
,
our
closest
shame?The
Revenger
's
Tragedy
.
<EOS>
WITH
that
quickness
of
perception
which
at
once
supplies
information
on
such
an
emergency
,
Luke
instantly
conjectured
who
was
before
him
.
<EOS>
Startled
as
he
was
,
he
yet
retained
his
composure
,
abiding
the
result
with
his
arms
folded
upon
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"Seize
<EOS>
him
!
"
cried
Lady
Rookwood
,
as
soon
as
she
could
command
her
speech
.
<EOS>
"He
rushes
on
his
death
if
he
stirs
,
"
exclaimed
Luke
,
pointing
his
pistol
.
<EOS>
"Bethink
<EOS>
you
where
you
are
,
villain
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ranulph
;
"
you
are
entrapped
in
your
own
toils
.
<EOS>
Submit
yourself
to
our
mercy
—
resistance
is
vain
,
and
will
not
secure
your
safety
,
while
it
will
aggravate
your
offence
.
<EOS>
Surrender
yourself——""Never
!
"
answered
Luke
.
"
<EOS>
Know
you
whom
you
ask
to
yield?""How
should
I
?
"
answered
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
that
instinct
which
tells
me
who
you
are
.
<EOS>
Ask
Lady
Rookwood
—
she
can
inform
you
,
if
she
will
.
<EOS>
""Parley
<EOS>
not
with
him
—
seize
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
robber
,
a
murderer
,
who
has
assailed
my
life
.
""Beware
!
"
said
Luke
to
Ranulph
,
who
was
preparing
to
obey
his
mother
's
commands
;
"
I
am
no
robber
—
no
murderer
.
<EOS>
Do
not
you
make
me
a
fratricide
.
<EOS>
""Fratricide
!
"
echoed
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"Heed
him
not
,
"
ejaculated
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
false
—
he
dares
not
harm
thee
,
for
his
soul
.
<EOS>
I
will
call
assistance
.
<EOS>
""Hold
,
mother
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Ranulph
,
detaining
Lady
Rookwood
;
"
this
man
may
be
what
he
represents
himself
.
<EOS>
Before
we
proceed
to
extremities
,
I
would
question
him
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
mentioned
it
in
your
hearing
could
it
have
been
avoided
,
but
my
father
had
another
son
.
<EOS>
"Lady
<EOS>
Rookwood
frowned
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
checked
him
,
but
Luke
rejoined—"You
have
spoken
the
truth
;
he
had
a
son
—
I
am
he
.
<EOS>
I——""Be
<EOS>
silent
,
I
command
you
!
"
said
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"Death
!
"
cried
Luke
,
in
a
loud
voice
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
be
silent
at
your
bidding
—
at
yours
—
who
regard
no
laws
,
human
or
divine
;
who
pursue
your
own
fell
purposes
,
without
fear
of
God
or
man
?
<EOS>
Waste
not
your
frowns
on
me
—
I
heed
them
not
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
am
like
a
tame
hound
,
to
be
cowed
to
silence
?
<EOS>
I
will
speak
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
Rookwood
,
the
name
you
bear
is
mine
,
and
by
a
right
as
good
as
is
your
own
.
<EOS>
From
his
loins
,
who
lies
a
corpse
before
us
,
I
sprang
.
<EOS>
No
brand
of
shame
is
on
my
birth
.
<EOS>
I
am
your
father
's
son
—
his
first
-
born
—
your
elder
brother
.
<EOS>
Hear
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
he
,
rushing
to
the
bier
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
this
body
,
I
swear
that
I
have
avouched
the
truth
—
and
though
to
me
the
dead
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
Rookwood
hath
never
been
what
a
father
should
be
to
a
son
—
though
I
have
never
known
his
smile
,
felt
his
caresses
,
or
received
his
blessing
,
yet
now
be
all
forgiven
,
all
forgotten
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
cast
himself
with
frantic
violence
upon
the
coffin
.
<EOS>
It
is
difficult
to
describe
the
feelings
with
which
Ranulph
heard
Luke
's
avowal
.
<EOS>
Amazement
and
dread
predominated
.
<EOS>
Unable
to
stir
,
he
stood
gazing
on
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Not
so
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
The
moment
for
action
was
arrived
.
<EOS>
Addressing
her
son
in
a
low
tone
,
she
said
,
"
Your
prey
is
within
your
power
.
<EOS>
Secure
him
.
<EOS>
""Wherefore
<EOS>
?
"
rejoined
Ranulph
;
"
if
he
be
my
brother
,
shall
I
raise
my
hand
against
him?""Wherefore
not
?
"
returned
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"'Twere
<EOS>
an
accursed
deed
,
"
replied
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"
The
mystery
is
resolved
.
'
<EOS>
Twas
for
this
that
I
was
summoned
home
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
what
say
you
?
<EOS>
summoned
!
<EOS>
by
whom?""My
father!""Your
father
?
"
echoed
Lady
Rookwood
,
in
great
surprise
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
my
dead
father
!
<EOS>
He
has
appeared
to
me
since
his
decease
.
<EOS>
""Ranulph
,
you
rave
—
you
are
distracted
with
grief
—
with
astonishment
.
<EOS>
""No
,
mother
<EOS>
;
but
I
will
not
struggle
against
my
destiny
.
<EOS>
""Pshaw
!
<EOS>
your
destiny
is
Rookwood
,
its
manors
,
its
lands
,
its
rent
-
roll
,
and
its
title
;
nor
shall
you
yield
it
to
a
base
-
born
churl
like
this
.
<EOS>
Let
him
prove
his
rights
.
<EOS>
Let
the
law
adjudge
them
to
him
,
and
we
will
yield
—
but
not
till
then
.
<EOS>
I
tell
thee
he
has
not
the
right
,
nor
can
he
maintain
it
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
deluded
dreamer
,
who
,
having
heard
some
idle
tale
of
his
birth
,
believes
it
,
because
it
chimes
with
his
wishes
.
<EOS>
I
treated
him
with
the
scorn
he
deserved
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
driven
him
from
my
presence
,
but
he
was
armed
,
as
you
see
,
and
forced
me
hither
,
perhaps
to
murder
me
;
a
deed
he
might
have
accomplished
had
it
not
been
for
your
intervention
.
<EOS>
His
life
is
already
forfeit
,
for
an
attempt
of
the
same
sort
last
night
.
<EOS>
Why
else
came
he
hither
?
<EOS>
for
what
else
did
he
drag
me
to
this
spot
?
<EOS>
Let
him
answer
that!""I
will
answer
it
,
"
replied
Luke
,
raising
himself
from
the
bier
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
ghastly
as
the
corpse
over
which
he
leaned
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
a
deed
to
do
,
which
I
wished
you
to
witness
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
wild
conception
.
<EOS>
But
the
means
by
which
I
have
acquired
the
information
of
my
rights
were
wild
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
,
we
are
both
the
slaves
of
fate
.
<EOS>
You
have
received
your
summons
hither
—
I
have
had
mine
.
<EOS>
Your
father
's
ghost
called
you
;
my
mother
's
spectral
hand
beckoned
me
.
<EOS>
Both
are
arrived
.
<EOS>
One
thing
more
remains
,
and
my
mission
is
completed
.
<EOS>
"
Saying
which
,
he
drew
forth
the
skeleton
hand
;
and
having
first
taken
the
wedding
-
ring
from
the
finger
,
he
placed
the
withered
limb
upon
the
left
breast
of
his
father
's
body
.
<EOS>
"
Rest
there
,
"
he
cried
,
"
for
ever
.
<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
you
suffer
that
?
"
said
Lady
Rookwood
,
tauntingly
,
to
her
son
.
<EOS>
"No
,
"
replied
Ranulph
;
"
such
profanation
of
the
dead
shall
not
be
endured
,
were
he
ten
times
my
brother
.
<EOS>
Stand
aside
,
"
added
he
,
advancing
towards
the
bier
,
and
motioning
Luke
away
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Withdraw
your
hand
from
my
father
's
body
,
and
remove
what
you
have
placed
upon
it
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
will
neither
remove
it
nor
suffer
it
to
be
removed
,
"
returned
Luke
.
"
<EOS>
'
Twas
for
that
purpose
<EOS>
I
came
hither
.
'
<EOS>
Twas
to
that
hand
he
was
united
in
life
,
in
death
he
shall
not
be
divided
from
it
.
<EOS>
""Such
irreverence
shall
not
be
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Ranulph
,
seizing
Luke
with
one
hand
,
and
snatching
at
the
cereclothes
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Remove
it
,
or
by
<EOS>
Heaven——""Leave
go
your
hold
,
"
said
Luke
,
in
a
voice
of
thunder
;
"
you
strive
in
vain
.
<EOS>
"Ranulph
ineffectually
attempted
to
push
him
backwards
;
and
,
shaking
away
the
grasp
that
was
fixed
upon
his
collar
,
seized
his
brother
's
wrist
,
so
as
to
prevent
the
accomplishment
of
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
In
this
unnatural
and
indecorous
strife
the
corpse
of
their
father
was
reft
of
its
covering
and
the
hand
discovered
lying
upon
the
pallid
breast
.
<EOS>
And
as
if
the
wanton
impiety
of
their
conduct
called
forth
an
immediate
rebuke
,
even
from
the
dead
,
a
frown
seemed
to
pass
over
Sir
Piers
's
features
,
as
their
angry
glances
fell
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
This
startling
effect
was
occasioned
by
the
approach
of
Lady
Rookwood
,
whose
shadow
,
falling
over
the
brow
and
visage
of
the
deceased
,
produced
the
appearance
we
have
described
.
<EOS>
Simultaneously
quitting
each
other
,
with
a
deep
sense
of
shame
,
mingled
with
remorse
,
both
remained
,
their
eyes
fixed
upon
the
dead
,
whose
repose
they
had
violated
.
<EOS>
Folding
the
graveclothes
decently
over
the
body
,
Luke
prepared
to
depart
.
<EOS>
"Hold
<EOS>
!
"
cried
Lady
Rookwood
;
"
you
go
not
hence
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
brother
Ranulph
will
not
oppose
my
departure
,
"
returned
Luke
;
"
who
else
shall
prevent
it?""That
will
I
!
"
<EOS>
cried
a
sharp
voice
behind
him
;
and
,
ere
he
could
turn
to
ascertain
from
whom
the
exclamation
proceeded
<EOS>
,
Luke
felt
himself
grappled
by
two
nervous
assailants
,
who
,
snatching
the
pistol
from
his
hold
,
fast
pinioned
his
arms
.
<EOS>
This
was
scarcely
the
work
of
a
moment
,
and
he
was
a
prisoner
before
he
could
offer
any
resistance
.
<EOS>
A
strong
smile
of
exultation
evinced
Lady
Rookwood
's
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"Bravo
,
my
lads
,
bravo
!
"
cried
Coates
,
stepping
forward
,
for
he
<EOS>
it
was
under
whose
skilful
superintendence
the
seizure
had
been
effected
:
"
famously
managed
;
my
father
the
thief
-
taker
's
runners
could
n't
have
done
it
better
—
hand
me
that
pistol
—
loaded
<EOS>
,
I
see
—
<EOS>
slugs
,
no
doubt
—
<EOS>
oh
,
he
's
a
precious
rascal
—
search
him
—
turn
his
pockets
inside
out
,
while
I
speak
to
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
"
Saying
which
,
the
brisk
attorney
,
enchanted
with
the
feat
he
had
performed
,
approached
Lady
Rookwood
with
a
profound
bow
,
and
an
amazing
smirk
of
self
-
satisfaction
.
"
<EOS>
Just
in
time
to
prevent
mischief
,
"
said
he
;
"
hope
your
ladyship
does
not
suffer
any
inconvenience
from
the
alarm
—
beg
pardon
,
<EOS>
annoyance
I
meant
to
say
—
which
this
horrible
outrage
must
have
occasioned
;
excessively
disagreeable
this
sort
of
thing
to
a
lady
at
any
time
,
but
at
a
period
like
this
more
than
usually
provoking
.
<EOS>
However
,
we
have
the
villain
safe
enough
.
<EOS>
Very
lucky
I
happened
to
be
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
your
ladyship
would
like
to
know
how
I
discovered——""Not
now
,
"
replied
Lady
Rookwood
,
checking
the
volubility
of
the
man
of
law
.
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
,
Mr.
Coates
,
for
the
service
you
have
rendered
me
;
you
will
now
add
materially
to
the
obligation
by
removing
the
prisoner
with
all
convenient
despatch
.
<EOS>
""Certainly
,
if
your
ladyship
wishes
it
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
detain
him
a
close
prisoner
in
the
hall
for
the
night
,
or
remove
him
at
once
to
the
lock
-
up
house
in
the
village?""Where
you
please
,
<EOS>
so
you
do
it
quickly
,
"
replied
Lady
Rookwood
,
noticing
,
with
great
uneasiness
,
the
agitated
manner
of
her
son
,
and
apprehensive
lest
,
in
the
presence
of
so
many
witnesses
,
he
might
say
or
do
something
prejudicial
to
their
interests
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
her
fears
groundless
.
<EOS>
As
Coates
was
about
to
return
to
the
prisoner
,
he
was
arrested
by
the
voice
of
Ranulph
,
commanding
him
to
stay
.
<EOS>
"Mr
.
<EOS>
Coates
,
"
said
he
,
"
however
appearances
may
be
against
this
man
<EOS>
,
he
is
no
robber
—
you
must
,
therefore
,
release
him
.
<EOS>
""Eh
day
,
what
's
that
?
<EOS>
release
him
,
Sir
Ranulph?""Yes
,
sir
<EOS>
;
I
tell
you
he
came
here
neither
with
the
intent
to
rob
nor
to
offer
violence
.
<EOS>
""That
is
false
,
Ranulph
,
"
replied
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
dragged
hither
by
him
at
the
peril
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
He
is
Mr.
Coates
's
prisoner
on
another
charge
.
<EOS>
""Unquestionably
,
your
ladyship
is
perfectly
right
;
I
have
a
warrant
against
him
for
assaulting
Hugh
Badger
,
the
keeper
,
and
for
other
misdemeanors
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
will
myself
be
responsible
for
his
appearance
to
that
charge
,
"
replied
Ranulph
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
sir
,
at
once
release
him
.
<EOS>
""At
your
peril
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
really
,
"
muttered
the
astonished
attorney
,
"
this
is
the
most
perplexing
proceeding
I
ever
witnessed
.
<EOS>
""Ranulph
,
"
said
Lady
Rookwood
,
sternly
,
to
her
son
,
"
beware
how
you
thwart
me!""Yes
,
Sir
Ranulph
,
let
me
venture
to
advise
you
,
as
a
friend
,
not
to
thwart
her
ladyship
,
"
whispered
the
attorney
;
"
indeed
,
she
is
in
the
right
.
"
<EOS>
But
seeing
his
advice
unheeded
,
Coates
withdrew
to
a
little
distance
.
<EOS>
"I
will
not
see
injustice
done
to
my
father
's
son
,
"
replied
Ranulph
,
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"
Why
would
you
detain
him?""Why
?
"
<EOS>
returned
she
,
"
our
safety
demands
it
—
our
honor
.
<EOS>
""Our
<EOS>
honor
demands
his
instant
liberation
;
each
moment
he
remains
in
those
bonds
sullies
its
purity
.
<EOS>
I
will
free
him
myself
from
his
fetters
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
brave
my
curse
,
foolish
boy
?
<EOS>
You
incurred
your
miserable
father
's
anathema
for
a
lighter
cause
than
this
.
<EOS>
Our
honor
cries
aloud
for
his
destruction
.
<EOS>
Have
I
not
been
injured
in
the
nicest
point
a
woman
can
be
injured
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
lend
my
name
to
mockery
and
scorn
,
by
base
acknowledgment
of
such
deceit
,
or
will
you
?
<EOS>
Where
would
be
my
honor
,
then
,
stripped
of
my
fair
estates
—
my
son
—
myself
—
beggars
—
dependent
on
the
bounty
of
an
upstart
?
<EOS>
Does
honor
ask
you
to
bear
this
?
<EOS>
It
is
a
phantom
sense
of
honor
,
unsubstantial
as
your
father
's
shade
,
of
which
you
just
now
spoke
,
that
would
prompt
you
to
do
otherwise
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
evoke
his
awful
spirit
,
mother
,
"
cried
Ranulph
,
with
a
shudder
;
"
do
not
arouse
his
wrath
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
arouse
my
wrath
,
"
returned
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
more
to
be
feared
.
<EOS>
Think
of
Eleanor
Mowbray
;
the
bar
between
your
nuptials
is
removed
.
<EOS>
Would
you
raise
up
a
greater
impediment?""Enough
,
mother
;
more
than
enough
.
<EOS>
You
have
decided
,
though
not
convinced
me
.
<EOS>
Detain
him
within
the
house
,
if
you
will
,
until
the
morrow
;
in
the
meantime
,
I
will
consider
over
my
line
of
conduct
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
this
,
then
,
your
resolve?""It
is
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Coates
,
"
said
Ranulph
,
calling
the
attorney
,
who
had
been
an
inquisitive
spectator
,
though
,
luckily
,
not
an
auditor
of
this
interview
,
"
unbind
the
prisoner
,
and
bring
him
hither
.
<EOS>
""Is
it
your
ladyship
's
pleasure
?
"
asked
Mr.
Coates
,
who
regretted
exceedingly
that
he
could
not
please
both
parties
.
<EOS>
Lady
Rookwood
signified
her
assent
by
a
slight
gesture
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"Your
bidding
shall
be
done
,
Sir
Ranulph
,
"
said
Coates
,
bowing
and
departing
.
<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
Ranulph
!
"
echoed
Lady
Rookwood
,
with
strong
emphasis
;
"
marked
you
that?""Body
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
'
me
,
"
muttered
the
attorney
,
"
this
is
the
most
extraordinary
family
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
Make
way
,
gentlemen
,
if
you
please
,
"
added
he
,
pushing
through
the
crowd
,
towards
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Having
described
what
took
place
between
Lady
Rookwood
and
her
son
in
one
part
of
the
room
,
we
must
now
briefly
narrate
some
incidental
occurrences
in
the
other
.
<EOS>
The
alarm
of
a
robber
having
been
taken
spread
with
great
celerity
through
the
house
,
and
almost
all
its
inmates
rushed
into
the
room
,
including
Dr.
Small
,
Titus
Tyrconnel
,
and
Jack
Palmer
.
<EOS>
"Odsbodikins
!
<EOS>
are
you
there
,
honey
?
<EOS>
"
said
Titus
,
who
discovered
his
ally
;
"
the
bird
's
caught
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
""Caught
be
d
—
d
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Jack
,
bluffly
;
"
so
I
see
;
all
his
own
fault
;
infernal
folly
to
come
here
,
at
such
a
time
as
this
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
ca
n't
be
helped
now
;
he
must
make
the
best
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
that
sneaking
,
gimlet
-
eyed
,
parchment
-
skinned
quill
-
driver
,
if
I
do
n't
serve
him
out
for
his
officiousness
one
of
these
days
,
my
name
's
not
Jack
Palmer
.
""Och
!
<EOS>
cushlamacree
!
<EOS>
did
I
ever
?
<EOS>
why
,
what
's
the
boy
to
you
,
Jack
?
<EOS>
Fair
play
's
a
jewel
,
and
surely
Mr.
Coates
only
did
his
duty
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
he
's
captured
,
for
his
relationship
to
Sir
Piers
,
and
because
I
think
he
'll
be
tucked
up
for
his
pains
;
and
,
moreover
,
I
could
forgive
the
poaching
;
but
as
to
the
breaking
into
a
house
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
,
och
!
<EOS>
It
's
a
plaguy
bad
look
.
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
he
's
worse
than
I
thought
him
.
<EOS>
"A
group
of
the
tenantry
,
many
of
whom
were
in
a
state
of
intoxication
,
had
,
in
the
meantime
,
formed
themselves
round
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Whatever
might
be
the
nature
of
his
thoughts
,
no
apprehension
was
visible
in
Luke
's
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
stood
erect
amidst
the
assemblage
,
his
tall
form
towering
above
them
all
,
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
movements
of
Lady
Rookwood
and
her
son
.
<EOS>
He
had
perceived
the
anguish
of
the
latter
,
and
the
vehemence
of
the
former
,
attributing
both
to
their
real
causes
.
<EOS>
The
taunts
and
jeers
,
threats
and
insolent
inquiries
,
of
the
hinds
who
thronged
around
him
,
passed
unheeded
;
yet
one
voice
in
his
ear

the

"You
have
done
well

"
said
Peter
,
"
have
you
not
?
<EOS>
Your
fetters
are

I
hope
,
to
your
liking

<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>

must
have
his

perhaps
the
next
time
you
will
be
content
to
follow
my
advice

<EOS>
You
must
now
free
yourself
,
the
best

you
can

from
these
Moabites

I
promise
you
it
will
be

<EOS>
Ha
,
ha!"Peter
withdrew
into
the
crowd
;
and
Luke
,
vainly
endeavoring
to
discover
his
retreating
figure
,
caught
the
eye
of
Jack
Palmer
fixed
upon
himself
,
with
a
peculiar
and
very
significant
expression
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Mr.
Coates
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
"Bring
<EOS>
forward
the
prisoner
,
"
said
the
man
of
law
to
his
two
assistants
;
and
Luke
was
accordingly
hurried
along
,
Mr.
Coates
using
his
best
efforts
to
keep
back
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
It
was
during
the
pressure
that
Luke
heard
a
voice
whisper
in
his
ear
,
"
Never
fear
;
all
's
right
!
"
and
turning
his
head
,
he
became
aware
of
the
propinquity
of
Jack
Palmer
.
<EOS>
The
latter
elevated
his
eyebrows
with
a
gesture
of
silence
,
and
Luke
passed
on
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
He
was
presently
confronted
with
Lady
Rookwood
and
her
son
;
and
,
notwithstanding
the
efforts
of
Mr.
Coates
,
seconded
by
some
few
others
,
the
crowd
grew
dense
around
them
.
"Remove
<EOS>
his
fetters
,
"
said
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
And
his
manacles
were
removed
.
<EOS>
"You
will
consent
to
remain
here
a
prisoner
till
to

morrow?""I
<EOS>
consent
to
nothing

"
replied
Luke
;
"
I
am
in
your
hands
.
<EOS>
""He
does
not
deserve
your
clemency
,
Sir
Ranulph
,
"
interposed
Coates
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
him
take
his
own
course
,
"
said
Lady
Rookwood
;
"
he
will
reap
the
benefit
of
it

<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
you
pledge
yourself
not

depart

"
asked
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"Of

cried
the
attorney
;
"
to
be
sure
he
will

<EOS>
Ha

returned
Luke
,
haughtily
,
"
I
will
not

and
you
will
detain
me
at
your
proper
peril
.
<EOS>
""Better
and
better

"
exclaimed
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
highest
joke
I
ever
heard

""I

ceremonial

<EOS>
You

""Ranulph

"
said
Luke
,
sternly
,
as
he
departed
,
"
you

cried
Lady

"
I
am
out

this
trilling

<EOS>
Follow
me
to

added
she
to
her
son
,
passing
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
concourse
of
spectators
,
who
had
listened
to
this
extraordinary
scene
in
astonishment
,
made
way
for
her
instantly
,
and
she
left
the
room
,
accompanied
by
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
The
prisoner
was
led
out
by
the
other
door
.
"Botheration

"
cried
Titus
to
Mr.
Coates
,
as
they
followed
in
the
wake
,
"
why
did
he
choose
out
me
?
<EOS>
I
'll
lose
the
funeral
entirely

""That

replied
Palmer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
be

returned
Coates
.
<EOS>
"

Sir
Ranulph

""That

THE
night
was
wild
and
stormy
.
<EOS>
The
day
had
been
sultry
,
with
a
lurid
,
metallic
-
looking
sky
,
hanging
like
a
vast
galvanic
plate
over
the
face
of
nature
.
<EOS>
As
evening
drew
on
,
everything
betokened
the
coming
tempest
.
<EOS>
Unerring
indications
of
its
approach
were
noted
by
the
weatherwise
at
the
hall
.
<EOS>
The
swallow
was
seen
to
skim
the
surface
of
the
pool
so
closely
that
he
ruffled
its
placid
mirror
as
he
passed
;
and
then
,
sharply
darting
round
and
round
,
with
twittering
scream
,
he
winged
his
rapid
flight
to
his
clay
-
built
home
,
beneath
the
barn
eaves
.
<EOS>
The
kine
that
had
herded
to
the
margin
of
the
water
,
and
sought
,
by
splashing
,
to
relieve
themselves
from
the
keen
persecution
of
their
myriad
insect
tormentors
,
wended
stallwards
,
undriven
,
and
deeply
lowing
.
<EOS>
The
deer
,
that
at
twilight
had
trooped
thither
also
for
refreshment
,
suddenly
,
"
with
expanded
nostrils
,
snuffed
the
air
,
"
and
bounded
off
to
their
coverts
,
amidst
the
sheltering
fernbrake
.
<EOS>
The
rooks
"
obstreperous
of
wing
,
in
crowds
combined
,
"
cawed
in
a
way
that
,
as
plainly
as
words
could
have
done
,
bespoke
their
apprehension
;
and
were
seen
,
some
hovering
and
beating
the
air
with
flapping
pinion
,
others
shooting
upwards
in
mid
space
,
as
if
to
reconnoitre
the
weather
;
while
others
,
again
,
were
croaking
to
their
mates
,
in
loud
discordant
tone
,
from
the
highest
branches
of
the
lime
-
trees
;
all
,
seemingly
,
as
anxious
and
as
busy
as
mariners
before
a
gale
of
wind
.
<EOS>
At
sunset
,
the
hazy
vapors
,
which
had
obscured
the
horizon
throughout
the
day
,
rose
up
in
spiral
volumes
,
like
smoke
from
a
burning
forest
,
and
,
becoming
gradually
condensed
,
assumed
the
form
of
huge
,
billowy
masses
,
which
,
reflecting
the
sun
's
light
,
changed
,
as
the
sinking
orb
declined
,
from
purple
to
flame
-
color
,
and
thence
to
ashy
,
angry
gray
.
<EOS>
Night
rushed
onwards
,
like
a
sable
steed
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
dead
calm
.
<EOS>
The
stillness
was
undisturbed
,
save
by
an
intermittent
,
sighing
wind
,
which
,
hollow
as
a
murmur
from
the
grave
,
died
as
it
rose
.
<EOS>
At
once
the
gray
clouds
turned
to
an
inky
blackness
.
<EOS>
A
single
,
sharp
,
intensely
vivid
flash
,
shot
from
the
bosom
of
the
rack
,
sheer
downwards
,
and
struck
the
earth
with
a
report
like
that
of
a
piece
of
ordnance
.
<EOS>
In
ten
minutes
it
was
dunnest
night
,
and
a
rattling
thunder
-
storm
.
<EOS>
The
progress
of
the
storm
was
watched
with
infinite
apprehension
by
the
crowd
of
tenantry
assembled
in
the
great
hall
;
and
loud
and
frequent
were
the
ejaculations
uttered
,
as
each
succeeding
peal
burst
over
their
heads
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
however
,
one
amongst
the
assemblage
who
seemed
to
enjoy
the
uproar
.
<EOS>
A
kindred
excitement
appeared
to
blaze
in
his
glances
,
as
he
looked
upon
the
storm
without
.
<EOS>
This
was
Peter
Bradley
.
<EOS>
He
stood
close
by
the
window
,
and
shaded
not
his
eyes
,
even
before
the
fiercest
flashes
.
<EOS>
A
grin
of
unnatural
exhilaration
played
upon
his
features
,
and
he
seemed
to
exult
in
,
and
to
court
,
the
tempestuous
horrors
,
which
affected
the
most
hardy
amongst
his
companions
with
consternation
,
and
made
all
shrink
,
trembling
,
into
the
recesses
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Peter
's
conduct
was
not
unobserved
,
nor
his
reputation
for
unholy
dealing
forgotten
.
<EOS>
To
some
he
was
almost
as
much
an
object
of
dread
as
the
storm
itself
.
<EOS>
"Didst
<EOS>
ever
see
the
like
o
'
that
?
"
said
Farmer
Burtenshaw
—
one
of
the
guests
,
<EOS>
whose
round
,
honest
face
good
wine
had
recently
empurpled
,
but
fear
had
now
mottled
white,—addressing
a
neighbor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Didst
ever
hear
of
any
man
that
were
a
Christian
laughing
in
the
very
face
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
a
thunder
-
storm
,
with
the
lightnin
'
fit
to
put
out
his
eyes
,
and
the
rattle
above
ready
to
break
<EOS>
the
drums
o
'
<EOS>
his
ears
?
<EOS>
I
always
thought
Peter
Bradley
was
not
exactly
what
he
ought
to
be
,
and
now
I
am
sure
on
it
.
""For
<EOS>
my
part
,
I
think
,
Neighbor
Burtenshaw
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
that
this
great
burst
of
weather
's
all
of
his
raising
,
for
in
all
my
born
days
<EOS>
I
never
see'd
such
a
hurly
-
burly
,
and
hope
never
to
see
the
like
of
it
again
.
<EOS>
I
've
heard
my
grandfather
tell
of
folk
as
could
command
wind
and
rain
;
and
,
mayhap
<EOS>
,
Peter
may
have
the
power
—
we
all
know
he
can
do
more
nor
any
other
man
.
<EOS>
""We
<EOS>
know
,
at
all
events
,
"
replied
Burtenshaw
,
"
that
he
lives
like
no
other
man
;
that
he
spends
night
after
night
by
himself
in
that
dreary
churchyard
;
that
he
keeps
no
living
thing
,
except
an
old
terrier
dog
,
in
his
crazy
cottage
;
and
that
he
never
asks
a
body
into
his
house
from
one
year
's
end
to
another
.
<EOS>
I
've
never
crossed
his
threshold
these
twenty
years
.
<EOS>
But
,
"
continued
he
mysteriously
,
"
I
happened
to
pass
the
house
one
dark
,
dismal
night
,
and
there
what
dost
think
I
see'd
through
the
window?""What
—
what
didst
<EOS>
see?""Peter
Bradley
sitting
with
a
great
book
open
on
his
knees
;
it
were
a
Bible
,
I
think
,
and
he
crying
like
a
child
.
<EOS>
""Art
<EOS>
sure
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
that?""The
tears
were
falling
fast
upon
the
leaves
,
"
returned
Burtenshaw
;
"
but
when
I
knocked
at
the
door
,
he
hastily
shut
up
the
book
,
and
ordered
me
to
be
gone
,
in
a
surly
tone
,
as
if
he
were
ashamed
of
being
caught
in
the
fact
.
<EOS>
""I
thought
no
tear
had
ever
dropped
from
his
eye
,
"
said
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
he
laughed
when
his
daughter
Susan
went
off
at
the
hall
;
and
,
when
she
died
,
folks
said
he
received
hush
-
money
to
say
nought
about
it
.
<EOS>
That
were
a
bad
business
,
anyhow
;
and
now
that
his
grandson
Luke
be
taken
in
the
fact
of
housebreaking
,
he
minds
it
no
more
,
not
he
,
than
if
nothing
had
happened
.
<EOS>
""Don't
be
too
sure
of
that
,
"
replied
Burtenshaw
;
"
he
may
be
scheming
summat
all
this
time
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
've
known
Peter
Bradley
now
these
two
-
and
-
fifty
years
,
and
,
excepting
that
one
night
,
I
never
saw
any
good
about
him
,
and
never
heard
of
nobody
who
could
tell
who
he
be
,
or
where
he
do
come
from
.
<EOS>
""One
<EOS>
thing
's
certain
,
at
least
,
"
replied
<EOS>
the
other
farmer—"he
were
never
born

How
he
came
here

knows

<EOS>
""He
be
—
what
he
certainly
will
be

"
interposed
another
speaker
,
in
a
louder
tone
,
and
with
less
of
apprehension
in
his
manner
than
his
comrade
,
probably
from
his
nerves
being
better
fortified
with
strong
liquor
.

"
<EOS>
Dost
thou
think
,
Samuel
Plant
,
as
how
Providence
would
entrust
the
like
o
'
him
with
the
command
of
the
elements
?
<EOS>
No
—
<EOS>
no
,
it
's
rank
blasphemy
to
suppose
such
a
thing
,
and
I
've
too
much
of
the
true
Catholic
and
apostate
church
about
me
,
to
stand
by
and
hear
that
said
.
<EOS>
""Maybe
,
then
,
he
gets
his
power
from
the
Prince
of
Darkness
,
"
replied
Plant
;
"
no
man
else
could
go
on
as
he
does
—
only
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
seems
to
be
watching
for
the
thunderbowt
.
<EOS>
""I
wish
he
may
catch
it
,
then
,
"
returned
the
other
.
<EOS>
"That
's
an
evil
wish

Simon
Toft

and
thou
mayst
repent
it

<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
I
,
"
replied
Toft
;
"
it
would
be
a
good
clearance
to
the
neighborhood
to
get
rid
o
'
th
'
old
croaking
curmudgeon

<EOS>
"Whether
or
not
Peter
overheard
the
conversation
,
we
pretend
not
to
say
,
but
at
that
moment
a
blaze
of
lightning
showed
him
staring
fiercely
at
the
group
.
<EOS>
"As
I
live
,
he
's
overheard
you
,
Simon

"
exclaimed
Plant
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
be
in
your

for
a
trifle

<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
I

"
added
Burtenshaw
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
him
overhear
me
,
"
answered
Toft
;
"
who
cares
?
<EOS>
he
shall
hear

worth
listening

I
'm
not
afraid

<EOS>
him

his

were
they
as
black
as
Beelzebuth

to
show
you
<EOS>
I
'm
not

I
'll
go

have
a

""Thou'rt
<EOS>
a
fool
for
thy

if
thou
dost

Friend
Toft

"
returned
Plant
,
"
<EOS>
that
's
all
I
can
say
.
<EOS>
""Be
advised
by
me
,
and
stay
here
,
"
seconded
Burtenshaw
,
endeavoring
to
hold
him
back
.
<EOS>
But
Toft
would
not
be
advised
—
Kings
may
be
blest
,
but
he
was
glorious
,
O'er
all
the
ills
of
life
victorious
.
<EOS>
Staggering
up
to
Peter
,
he
laid
a
hard
grasp
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
,
thus
forcibly
soliciting
his
attention
,
burst
into
a
loud
horse
-
laugh
.
<EOS>
But
Peter
was
,
or
affected
to
be
,
too
much
occupied
to
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
dost
see
,
man
,
that
thou
starest
so?""It
comes
,
it
comes
—
the
rain
—
the

a

a

<EOS>
Blessed
is
the
corpse

<EOS>
Sir
Piers
may
be
drenched
through
his

by
such
a
downfall
as
that

splash

splash
—
fire

water
and
thunder

all
together
—
is
not
that
fine?—ha

<EOS>
The
heavens
will
weep
for
him
,
though
friends
shed
not
a
tear

<EOS>
When
did
a
great
man
's
heir
feel
sympathy
for
his

's
decease

<EOS>
When
did

<EOS>
When

<EOS>
Never

He

We

<EOS>
We
were
created
to
do
so

why
else
should
we
act
thus
?
<EOS>
I
never
wept
for
any

I
have
often
laughed

Natural

The

<EOS>
Down
,
down
—
buckets
and
pails
,
ha

was
a
pause
,
during
which
the
sexton
,
almost
exhausted
by
the
frenzy
in
which
he
had
suffered
himself
to
be
involved
,
seemed
insensible
to
all
around
him
.
<EOS>
"I
tell
you
what
,
"
said
Burtenshaw
to
Plant
,
"
I
have
always
thought
there
was
more
in
Peter
Bradley
nor
appears
on

<EOS>
He
is
not
what
he
seems
to
be

take
my
word
on
it
.
<EOS>
Lord
love
you
!
<EOS>
do
you
think
a
man
such
as
he
pretends
to
be
could
talk
in
that
sort
of
way
—
about
nat'ral
simpering?—no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
"When
<EOS>
Peter
recovered
,
his
insane
merriment
broke
out
afresh
,
having
only
acquired
fury
by
the
pause
.
<EOS>
"Look
out
,
look
out
!
"
<EOS>
cried
he
;
"
hark
to
the
thunder
—
list
to
the
rain

<EOS>
Marked

marked
ye

<EOS>
tis
the
rook
—
the
great
bird
of
the

,
that
hath
borne
away
the
soul
of
the
departed

<EOS>
There
,
there
—
can
you
not
see
it
?
<EOS>
it
sits
and
croaks
through
storm
and
rain
,
and
never
heeds
at
all
—
and
wherefore
<EOS>
should
it
heed
?
<EOS>
See
,
it
flaps
its
broad
black
wings
<EOS>
—
it
croaks
—
ha
,
ha

<EOS>
It
comes
—
it
comes
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
driven
,
it
might
be
by
the
terror
of
the
storm
,
from
more
secure
quarters
,
a
bird
,
at
this
instant
,
was
dashed
against
the
window
,
and
fell
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"That
's
a
call
,
"
continued
Peter
;
"
it
will
be
over
soon
,
and
we
must
set
out
.
<EOS>
The
dead
will
not
need
to
tarry
.
<EOS>
Look
at
that
trail
of
fire
along
the
avenue
;
dost
see
yon
line
of
sparkles
,
like
a

take

<EOS>
St.
Hermes
's
flickering
fire
,
Robin
Goodfellow

dancing
light
,
or
the
blue
flame
of
the
corpse

candle
,
which
I
saw
flitting
to
the
churchyard
last
week
,
was
not
so
pretty
a
sight
—
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
You
asked
me
for
a
song
a
moment
ago
—
you
shall
have
one
now
without
asking
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
without
waiting
to
consult
the
inclinations
of
his
comrades
,
Peter
broke
into
the
following
wild
strain
with
all
the
fervor
of
a
half
-
crazed
improvisatore
:
<EOS>
THE
CORPSE
-
CANDLELambere

<EOS>
Through
the
midnight
gloom
did
a
pale
blue
lightTo
<EOS>
the
churchyard
mirk
wing
its
lonesome
<EOS>
flight:—Thrice
it
floated
those
old
walls
round
—
<EOS>
Thrice
it
paused
—
till
the
grave
it
found
.
<EOS>
Over
the
grass
-
green
sod
it
glanced
,
Over
the
fresh
-
turned
earth
it
danced
,
Like
a
torch
in
the
night
-
breeze
quivering
—
Never
was
seen
so
gay
<EOS>
a
thing!Never
was
seen
so
blithe
<EOS>
a
sightAs
<EOS>
the
midnight
dance
of
that
blue
light!Now
<EOS>
what
of
that
pale
blue
flame
dost
<EOS>
know?Canst
tell
where
it
comes
from
,
or
where
it
will
go?Is
it
<EOS>
the
soul
,
released
from
clay
,
Over
the
earth
that
takes
its
way
,
And
tarries
a
moment
in
mirth
and
gleeWhere
<EOS>
the
corse
it
hath
quitted
interred
shall
be?Or
is
it
the
trick
of
some
fanciful
sprite
,
That
taketh
in
mortal
mischance
delight
,
And
marketh
the
road

coffin
shall
go
,
And
the
spot
where
the

shall
be
soon
laid
low?Ask
him
who
can
answer
these
questions
<EOS>
aright;I
know

light!"I
<EOS>

said
Toft
,
as
the
sexton
finished
his
stave
,
"
<EOS>
but
if
thou
didst
see
a
corpse
-
candle
,
as
thou
call'st
thy
pale
blue
flame
,
whose
death
doth
it
betoken?—eh!""Thine

"
returned
Peter
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"Mine
!
<EOS>
thou
lying
old
cheat
—
dost
dare
to
say
that
to
my
face
?
<EOS>
Why
,
I
'm
as
hale
and
hearty
as
ever
a
man
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Dost
think
there
's
no
life
and
vigor
in
this
arm
,
<EOS>
thou
drivelling
old
dotard?"Upon
<EOS>
which
,
Toft
seized
Peter
by
the
throat
with
an
energy
that
,
but
for
the
timely
intervention
of
the
company
,
who
rushed
to
his
assistance
,
the
prophet
might
himself
have
anticipated
the
doom
he
prognosticated
.
<EOS>
Released
from
the
grasp
of
Toft
,
who
was
held
back
by
the
bystanders
,
Peter
again
broke
forth
into
his
eldritch
laugh
;
and
staring
right
into
the
face
of
his
adversary
,
with
eyes
glistening
,
and
hands
uplifted
,
as
if
in
the
act
of
calling
down
an
imprecation
on
his
head
,
he
screamed
,
in
a
shrill
and
discordant
voice
,
"
Soh
!
<EOS>
you
will
not
take
my
warning
?
<EOS>
you
revile
me
—
you
flout
me
!
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
your
fate
shall
prove
a
warning
to
all
unbelievers
—
they
shall
remember
this
night
,
though
youwill
not
.
<EOS>
Fool
!
<EOS>
fool!—your
doom
has
long
been
sealed
!
<EOS>
I
saw
your
wraith
choose
out
its
last
lodgment
on
Halloween
;
I
know
the
spot
.
<EOS>
Your
grave
is
dug
already
—
ha
,
ha
!
"
<EOS>
And
,
with
renewed
laughter
,
Peter
rushed
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"Did
<EOS>
I
not
caution
thee
not
to
provoke
him
,
friend
Toft
?
"
said
Plant
;
<EOS>
"
it
's
ill
playing
with
edge
-
tools
;
but
do
n't
let
him
fly
off
in
that
tantrum
—
one
of
ye
go
after
him
.
<EOS>
""That
will
I
,
"
replied
Burtenshaw
;
and
he
departed
in
search
of
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"I'd
<EOS>
advise
thee
to
make
it
up
with
Peter
so
soon
as
thou
canst
,
neighbor
,
"
continued
Plant
;
"
he
's
a
bad
friend
,
but
a
worse
enemy
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
,
what
harm
can
he
do
me
?
"
<EOS>
returned
Toft
,
who
,
however
,
was
not
without
some
misgivings
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
must
die
,
I
ca
n't
help
it
—
I
shall
go
none
the
sooner
for
him
,
even
if
he
speak
the
truth
,
which
I
do
n't
think
he
do
;
and
if
I
must
,
I
sha'n't
go
unprepared
—
only
I
think
as
how
,
if
it
pleased
Providence
,
I
could
have
wished
to
keep
my
old
missus
company
some
few
years
longer
,
and
see
those
bits
of
lasses
of
mine
grow
up
into
women
,
and
respectably
provided
for
.
<EOS>
But
His
will
be
done
.
<EOS>
I
sha'n't
leave
'em
quite
penniless
,
and
there
's
one
eye
at
least
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
,
wo
n't
be
dry
at
my
departure
.
<EOS>
"
Here
the
stout
heart
of
Toft
gave
way
,
and
he
shed
some
few
"
natural
tears
,
"
which
,
however
,
he
speedily
brushed
away
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
neighbors
,
"
continued
he
,
"
<EOS>
I
think
we
may
all
as
well
be
thinking
of
going
to
our
own
homes
,
for
,
to
my
mind
<EOS>
,
we
shall
never
reach
the
churchyard
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
""That
you
never
will
,
"
exclaimed
a
voice
behind
him
;
and
Toft
,
turning
round
,
again
met
the
glance
of
Peter
.
<EOS>
"Come
,
come
,
Master
Peter
<EOS>
,
"
cried
the
good
-
natured
farmer
,
"
this
be
ugly
jesting

ax
pardon
for
my

it
—
sorry
for
what
I

—
so
give
us
thy
hand
,
man
,
and
think
no
more
about
it

<EOS>
"Peter
<EOS>
extended
his
claw
,
and
the
parties
were
,
apparently
,
once
more
upon
terms
of
friendship

<EOS>
A
supply
of
spirits
was
here
introduced
;
lights
were
brought
at
the
same
time
,
and
placed
upon
a
long
oak
table
.
<EOS>
The
party
gathering
round
it
,
ill
-
humor
was
speedily
dissipated
,
and
even
the
storm
disregarded
,
in
the
copious
libations
that
ensued
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
a
loiterer
appeared
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
His
movements
were
unnoticed
by
all
excepting
the
sexton
,
who
watched
his
proceedings
with
some
curiosity
.
<EOS>
The
person
walked
to
the
window
,
appearing
,
so
far
as
could
be
discovered
,
to
eye
the
storm
with
great
impatience
.
<EOS>
He
then
paced
the
hall
rapidly
backwards
and
forwards
,
and
Peter
fancied
he
could
detect
sounds
of
disappointment
in
his
muttered
exclamations
.
<EOS>
Again
he
returned
to
the
window
,
as
if
to
ascertain
the
probable
duration
of
the
shower
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
hopeless
endeavor
;
all
was
pitch
-
dark
without
;
the
lightning
was
now
only
seen
at
long
intervals
,
but
the
rain
still
audibly
descended
in
torrents
.
<EOS>
Apparently
seeing
the
impossibility
of
controlling
the
elements
,
the
person
approached
the
table
.
<EOS>
"What
think
you
of
the
night
,
Mr.
Palmer
?
"
asked
the
sexton
of
Jack
,
for
he
was
the
anxious
investigator
of
the
weather
.
<EOS>
"Don't
<EOS>
know
—
can't
say
—
set
in
<EOS>
,
I
think
—
cursed
unlucky
—
for
the
funeral
,
I
mean
—
we
shall
be
drowned
if
we
go
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
drunk
if
we
stay
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
Peter
.
"
<EOS>
But
never
fear
,
it
will
hold
up
,
depend
upon
it
,
long
before
we
can
start
.
<EOS>
Where
have
they
put
the
prisoner
?
"
<EOS>
asked
he
,
with
a
sudden
change
of
manner
.
<EOS>
"I
know
the
room
,
but
ca
n't
describe
it
;
it
's
two
or
three
doors
down
the
lower
corridor
of
the
eastern
gallery
.
<EOS>
""Good

<EOS>

<EOS>
""Enough

<EOS>
""Come

Peter

"
roared
Toft
,
"
<EOS>
let
's
have
another
stave
.
<EOS>
Give
us
one
of
your
odd
snatches

<EOS>
No
more

<EOS>
Something

shouted
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A

from
a
death's
-
head
—
ha
,
ha!""My
songs
are
all
of

"
returned
Peter
;
"
I
am
seldom
asked
to
sing
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
However
,
you
are

<EOS>
And
preparing
himself
,
like
certain
other
accomplished
vocalists
,
with
a
few
preliminary
hems
and
haws
,
he
struck
forth
the
following
doleful
ditty
:
THE
OLD
OAK
<EOS>
COFFINSic
ego
componi
versus
in
ossa
velim
.
<EOS>
—
Tibullus
.
<EOS>
In
a
churchyard
,
upon
the
sward
,
a
coffin
there
was
laid
,
And
leaning
stood
,
beside
the
wood
,
a
sexton
on
his
spade
.
<EOS>
A
coffin
old
and
black
it
was
,
and
fashioned
curiously
,
With
quaint
device
of
carved
oak
,
in
hideous
fantasie
.
<EOS>
For
here
was
wrought
the
sculptured
thought
of
a
tormented
face
,
With
serpents
lithe
that
round
it
<EOS>
writhe
,
in
folded
strict
embrace
.
<EOS>
Grim
visages
of
grinning
fiends
were
at
each
corner
set
,
And
emblematic
scrolls
,
mort
-
heads
,
and
bones
together
met
.
<EOS>
"Ah
,
welladay
!
"
<EOS>
that
sexton
gray
unto
himself
did
cry,"Beneath
that
lid
much
lieth
hid
—
much
awful
mysterie
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
ancient
coffin
from
the
abbey
that
stood
here;Perchance
<EOS>
it
holds
an
abbot
's
bones
,
perchance
those
of
a
frere
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
digging
deep
,
where
monks
do
sleep
,
beneath
yon
cloister
shrined
,
That
coffin
old
,
within
the
mould
,
it
was
my
chance
to
find;The
costly
carvings
of
the
lid
I
scraped
full
carefully
,
In
hope
to
get
at
name
or
date
,
yet
nothing
could
I
see
.
<EOS>
"With
pick
and
spade
<EOS>
I
've
plied
my
trade
for
sixty
years
and
more
,
Yet
never
found
,
beneath
the
ground
,
shell
strange
as
that
before;Full
<EOS>
many
coffins
<EOS>
have
I
seen
—
have
seen
them
deep
or
flat
,
<EOS>
Fantastical
in
fashion
—
none
fantastical
as
that
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
saying
so
,
with
heavy
blow
,
the
lid
he
shattered
wide
,
And
,
pale
with
fright
,
a
ghastly
sight
that
sexton
gray
espied;A
<EOS>
miserable
sight
<EOS>
it
was
,
that
loathsome
corpse
to
see
,
<EOS>
The
last
,
last
,
dreary
,
darksome
stage
of
fall'n
humanity
.
<EOS>
Though
all
was
gone
,
save
reeky
bone
,
a
green
and
grisly
heap
,
With
scarce
a
trace
of
fleshly
face
,
<EOS>
strange
posture
<EOS>
did
it
keep
.
<EOS>
The
hands
were
clenched
,
the
teeth
were
wrenched
,
as
if
the
wretch
had
risen
,
E'en
after
death
had
ta'en
<EOS>
his
breath
,
to
strive
and
burst
his
prison
.
<EOS>
The
neck
was
bent
,
the
nails
were
rent
,
<EOS>
no
limb
or
joint
was
straight;Together
glued
,
with
blood
imbued
,
black
and
coagulate
.
<EOS>
And
,
as
the
sexton
stooped
him
down
to
lift
the
coffin
plank
,
His
fingers
were
defiled
all
o'er
with
slimy
substance
dank
.
<EOS>
"Ah
,
welladay
!
"
<EOS>
that
sexton
gray
unto
himself
did
cry,"Full
<EOS>
well
I
see
how
Fate
's
decree
foredoomed
this
wretch
to
die;A
living
man
,
a
breathing
man
,
within
the
coffin
thrust
,
Alack
!
<EOS>
alack
!
<EOS>
the
agony
ere
he
returned
to
dust!"A
<EOS>
vision
drear
did
then
appear
unto
that
sexton
's
eyes;Like
that
poor
wight
before
him
<EOS>
straight
he
in
a
coffin
lies
.
<EOS>
He
lieth
in
a
trance
within
that
coffin
close
and
fast;Yet
though
he
sleepeth
now
<EOS>
,
he
feels
he
shall
awake
at
last
.
<EOS>
The
coffin
,
then
,
by
reverend
men
,
is
borne
with
footsteps
slow
,
Where
tapers
shine
before
the
shrine
,
where
breathes
the
requiem
low;And
<EOS>
for
the
dead
the
prayer
is
said
,
for
the
soul
that
is
not
flown
—
Then
all
is
drowned
in
hollow
sound
,
the
earth
is
o'er
him
thrown!He
draweth
breath
—
he
wakes
from
death
to
life
more
horrible;To
agony
!
<EOS>
such
agony
!
<EOS>
no
living
tongue
may
tell
.
<EOS>
Die
!
<EOS>
die
he
must
,
that
wretched
one
!
<EOS>
he
struggles
—
strives
in
vain;No
more
Heaven
's
light
,
nor
sunshine
bright
,
shall
he
behold
again
.
<EOS>
"Gramercy
,
Lord
!
"
<EOS>
the
sexton
roared
,
awakening
<EOS>
suddenly,"If
<EOS>
this
be
dream
,
yet
doth
<EOS>
it
seem
most
dreadful
so
to
die
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
cast
my
body
in
the
sea
!
<EOS>
or
hurl
it
on
the
shore!But
nail
me
not
in
coffin
fast
—
<EOS>
no
grave
will
I
dig
more
.
<EOS>
"It
was
not
difficult
to
discover
the
effect
produced
by
this
song
,
in
the
lengthened
faces
of
the
greater
part
of
the
audience
.
<EOS>
Jack
Palmer
,
however
,
laughed
loud
and
long
.
<EOS>
"Bravo
<EOS>
,
bravo
!
"
<EOS>
cried
he
;
"
that
suits
my
humor
exactly
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
abide
the
thoughts
of
a
coffin
.
<EOS>
No
deal
box
for
me
.
<EOS>
""A
gibbet
might
,
perhaps
,
serve
your
turn
as
well
,
"
muttered
the
sexton
;
adding
aloud
,
"
I
am
now
entitled
to
call
upon
you;—a
song!—a
song!""Ay
,
a
song
,
Mr.
Palmer
,
a
song
!
"
reiterated
the
hinds
.
<EOS>
"
Yours
will
be
the
right
kind
of
thing
.
<EOS>
""Say
<EOS>
no
more
,
"
replied
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
give
you
a
chant
composed
upon
Dick
Turpin
,
the
highwayman
.
<EOS>
It
's
no
great
shakes
,
to
be
sure
,
but
it
's
the
best
I
have
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
with
a
knowing
wink
at
the
sexton
,
he
commenced
,
in
the
true
nasal
whine
,
<EOS>
the
following
strain
:
<EOS>
ONE
FOOT
IN
THE
STIRRUPOR
<EOS>
TURPIN
'S
FIRST
<EOS>
FLINGCum
esset
proposita
fuga
Turpi(n)s
.
<EOS>
—
Cicero
.
<EOS>
"One
<EOS>
foot
in
the
stirrup
,
one
hand
in
the
rein
,
<EOS>
And
the
noose
be
my
portion
,
or
freedom
<EOS>
I
'll
gain!Oh
!
<EOS>
give
me
a
seat
in
my
saddle
once
more
,
And
these
bloodhounds
shall
find
that
the
chase
is
not
o'er!"Thus
muttered
Dick
Turpin
,
who
found
,
while
he
slept
,
That
the
Philistines
old
on
his
slumbers
had
crept;Had
entrapped
him
as
puss
on
her
form
you
'd
ensnare
,
And
that
gone
were
his
snappers
—
and
gone
<EOS>
was
his
mare
.
<EOS>
Hilloah!How
Dick
had
been
captured
is
readily
told
,
The
pursuit
had
been
hot
,
though
the
night
had
been
cold
,
So
at
daybreak
,
exhausted
,
he
sought
brief
reposeMid
the
thick
of
a
corn
-
field
,
away
from
his
foes
.
<EOS>
But
in
vain
was
his
caution
—
in
vain
did
his
steed
,
<EOS>
Ever
watchful
and
wakeful
in
moments
of
need
,
With
lip
and
with
hoof
on
her
master
's
cheek
press
—
He
slept
on
,
nor
heeded
the
warning
of
Bess
.
<EOS>
Hilloah!"Zounds
!
<EOS>
gem'men
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Turpin
,
<EOS>
"
you
've
found
me
at
fault
,
And
the
highflying
highwayman
's
come
to
a
halt;You
have
turned
up
a
trump
—
for
I
weigh
well
<EOS>
my
weight,—And
<EOS>
the
forty
is
yours
,
though
the
halter
's
my
fate
.
<EOS>
Well
,
come
on't
<EOS>
what
will
,
you
shall
own
when
all
's
past
,
That
Dick
Turpin
,
the
Dauntless
,
was
game
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
But
,
before
we
go
further
,
I
'll
hold
you
a
bet
,
That
one
foot
in
my
stirrup
<EOS>
you
wo
n't
let
me
set
.
<EOS>
Hilloah!"A
hundred
to
one
is
the
odds
I
will
stand
<EOS>
,
A
hundred
to
one
is
the
odds
<EOS>
you
command;Here
's
a
handful
of
goldfinches
<EOS>
ready
to
fly!May
<EOS>
I
venture
a
foot
in
my
stirrup
to
try?"As
<EOS>
he
carelessly
spoke
,
Dick
directed
a
glanceAt
his
courser
,
and
motioned
her
slyly
askance:—You
might
tell
by
the
singular
toss
of
her
head
,
And
the
prick
of
her
ears
,
that
his
meaning
she
read
.
<EOS>
Hilloah!With
derision
at
first
was
Dick
's
wager
received
,
And
his
error
at
starting
as
yet
unretrieved;But
when
from
his
pocket
the
shiners
he
drew
,
And
offered
to
"
make
up
the
hundred
to
two,"There
were
havers
in
plenty
,
and
each
whispered
each
,
<EOS>
The
same
thing
,
though
varied
in
figure
of
speech,"Let
<EOS>
the
fool
act
his
folly
—
<EOS>
the
stirrup
of
Bess!He
has
put
his
foot
in
it
already
,
we
guess!"Hilloah!Bess
was
brought
to
her
master
—
Dick
steadfastly
gazedAt
the
eye
of
his
mare
<EOS>
,
then
his
foot
quick
upraised;His
toe
touched
the
stirrup
,
his
hand
grasped
the
rein
—
<EOS>
He
was
safe
on
the
back
of
his
courser
again!As
<EOS>
the
clarion
,
fray
-
sounding
and
shrill
,
was
the
neighOf
Black
Bess
,
as
she
answered
his
cry
"
Hark
-
away!""Beset
me
,
ye
bloodhounds
!
<EOS>
in
rear
and
in
van;My
foot
's
in
the
stirrup
and
catch
me
who
can!"Hilloah!There
was
riding
and
gibing
mid
rabble
and
rout
,
And
the
old
woods
re
-
echoed
the
Philistines
'
shout!There
was
hurling
and
whirling
o'er
brake
and
o'er
brier
,
But
the
course
of
Dick
Turpin
was
swift
as
Heaven
's
fire
.
<EOS>
Whipping
,
spurring
,
and
straining
<EOS>
would
nothing
avail
,
Dick
laughed
at
their
curses
,
and
scoffed
at
their
wail;"My
foot
's
in
the
stirrup!"—thus
rang
his
last
cry;"Bess
<EOS>
has
answered
my
call
;
now
her
mettle
<EOS>
we
'll
try!"Hilloah!Uproarious
applause
followed
Jack
's
song
,
when
the
joviality
of
the
mourners
was
interrupted
by
a
summons
to
attend
in
the
state
-
room
.
<EOS>
Silence
was
at
once
completely
restored
;
and
,
in
the
best
order
they
could
assume
,
they
followed
their
leader
,
Peter
Bradley
.
<EOS>
Jack
Palmer
was
amongst
the
last
to
enter
,
and
remained
a
not
incurious
spectator
of
a
by
no
means
common
scene
.
<EOS>
Preparations
had
been
made
to
give
due
solemnity
to
the
ceremonial
.
<EOS>
The
leaden
coffin
was
fastened
down
,
and
enclosed
in
an
outer
case
of
oak
,
upon
the
lid
of
which
stood
a
richly
-
chased
massive
silver
flagon
,
filled
with
burnt
claret
,
called
the
grace
-
cup
.
<EOS>
All
the
lights
were
removed
,
save
two
lofty
wax
flambeaux
,
which
were
placed
to
the
back
,
and
threw
a
lurid
glare
upon
the
group
immediately
about
the
body
,
consisting
of
Ranulph
Rookwood
and
some
other
friends
of
the
deceased
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Small
stood
in
front
of
the
bier
;
and
,
under
the
directions
of
Peter
Bradley
,
the
tenantry
and
household
were
formed
into
a
wide
half
-
moon
across
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
hush
of
expectation
,
as
Dr.
Small
looked
gravely
round
;
and
even
Jack
Palmer
,
who
was
as
little
likely
as
any
man
to
yield
to
an
impression
of
the
kind
,
felt
himself
moved
by
the
scene
.
<EOS>
The
very
orthodox
Small
,
as
is
well
known
to
our
readers
,
held
everything
savoring
of
the
superstitions
of
the
Scarlet
Woman
in
supreme
abomination
;
and
,
entertaining
such
opinions
,
it
can
scarcely
be
supposed
that
a
funeral
oration
would
find
much
favor
in
his
eyes
,
accompanied
,
as
it
was
,
with
the
accessories
of
censer
,
candle
,
and
cup
;
all
evidently
derived
from
that
period
when
,
under
the
three
-
crowned
pontiff
's
sway
,
the
shaven
priest
pronounced
his
benediction
<EOS>
o'er
the
dead
,
and
released
the
penitent
's
soul
from
purgatorial
flames
,
while
he
heavily
mulcted
the
price
of
his
redemption
from
the
possessions
of
his
successor
.
<EOS>
Small
resented
the
idea
of
treading
in
such
steps
,
as
an
insult
to
himself
and
his
cloth
.
<EOS>
Was
he
,
the
intolerant
of
Papistry
,
to
tolerate
this
?
<EOS>
Was
he
,
who
could
not
endure
the
odor
of
Catholicism
,
to
have
his
nostrils
thus
polluted
—
his
garments
thus
defiled
by
actual
contact
with
it
?
<EOS>
It
was
not
to
be
thought
of
:
and
he
had
formally
signified
his
declination
to
Mr.
Coates
,
when
a
little
conversation
with
that
gentleman
,
and
certain
weighty
considerations
therein
held
forth
—
the
advowson
of
the
church
of
Rookwood
residing
with
the
family
—
and
represented
by
him
,
as
well
as
the
placing
in
juxtaposition
of
penalties
to
be
incurred
by
refusal
,
that
the
scruples
of
Small
gave
way
;
and
,
with
the
best
grace
he
could
muster
,
very
reluctantly
promised
compliance
.
<EOS>
With
these
feelings
,
it
will
be
readily
conceived
that
the
doctor
was
not
in
the
best
possible
frame
of
mind
for
the
delivery
of
his
exhortation
.
<EOS>
His
spirit
had
been
ruffled
by
a
variety
of
petty
annoyances
,
amongst
the
greatest
of
which
was
the
condition
to
which
the
good
cheer
had
reduced
his
clerk
,
Zachariah
Trundletext
,
whose
reeling
eye
,
pendulous
position
,
and
open
mouth
proclaimed
him
absolutely
incapable
of
office
.
<EOS>
Zachariah
was
,
in
consequence
,
dismissed
,
and
Small
commenced
his
discourse
unsupported
.
<EOS>
But
as
our
recording
it
would
not
probably
conduce
to
the
amusement
of
our
readers
,
whatever
it
might
to
their
edification
,
we
shall
pass
it
over
with
very
brief
mention
.
<EOS>
Suffice
it
to
say
,
that
the
oration
was
so
thickly
interstrewn
with
lengthy
quotations
from
the
fathers,—Chrysostomus
,
Hieronymus
,
Ambrosius
,
Basilius
,
Bernardus
,
and
the
rest
,
with
whose
recondite
Latinity
,
notwithstanding
the
clashing
of
their
opinions
with
his
own
,
the
doctor
was
intimately
acquainted
,
and
which
he
moreover
delighted
to
quote,—that
<EOS>
his
auditors
were
absolutely
mystified
and
perplexed
,
and
probably
not
without
design
.
<EOS>
Countenances
of
such
amazement
were
turned
towards
him
,
that
Small
,
who
had
a
keen
sense
of
the
ludicrous
,
could
scarcely
forbear
smiling
as
he
proceeded
;
and
if
we
could
suspect
so
grave
a
personage
of
waggery
,
we
should
almost
think
that
,
by
way
of
retaliation
,
he
had
palmed
some
abstruse
,
monkish
epicedium
upon
his
astounded
auditors
.
<EOS>
The
oration
concluded
,
biscuits
and
confectionery
were
,
according
to
old
observance
,
handed
to
such
of
the
tenantry
as
chose
to
partake
of
them
.
<EOS>
The
serving
of
the
grace
-
cup
,
which
ought
to
have
formed
part
of
the
duties
of
Zachariah
,
had
he
been
capable
of
office
,
fell
to
the
share
of
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
The
bowl
was
kissed
,
first
by
Ranulph
,
with
lips
that
trembled
with
emotion
,
and
afterward
by
his
surrounding
friends
;
but
no
drop
was
tasted
—
a
circumstance
which
did
not
escape
Peter
's
observation
.
<EOS>
Proceeding
to
the
tenantry
,
the
first
in
order
happened
to
be
Farmer
Toft
.
<EOS>
Peter
presented
the
cup
,
and
as
Toft
was
about
to
drain
a
deep
draught
of
the
wine
,
Peter
whispered
in
his
ear
,
"
Take
my
advice
for
once
,
Friend
Toft
,
and
do
n't
let
a
bubble
of
the
liquid
pass
your
lips
.
<EOS>
For
every
drop
of
the
wine
you
drain
,
Sir
Piers
will
have
one
sin
the
less
,
and
you
a
load
the
heavier
on
your
conscience
.
<EOS>
Didst
never
hear
of
sin
-
swallowing
?
<EOS>
For
what
else
was
this
custom
adopted
?
<EOS>
Seest
thou
not
the
cup
's
brim
hath
not
yet
been
moistened
?
<EOS>
Well
,
as
you
will
—
ha
,
ha
!
"
<EOS>
And
the
sexton
passed
onwards
.
<EOS>
His
work
being
nearly
completed
,
he
looked
around
for
Jack
Palmer
,
whom
he
had
remarked
during
the
oration
,
but
could
nowhere
discover
him
.
<EOS>
Peter
was
about
to
place
the
flagon
,
now
almost
drained
of
its
contents
,
upon
its
former
resting
-
place
,
when
Small
took
it
from
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
poculi
fundo
residuum
non
relinque
,
admonisheth
Pythagoras
,
"
said
he
,
returning
the
empty
cup
to
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
task
here
is
ended
,
"
muttered
Peter
,
"
but
not
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Foul
weather
or
fine
,
thunder
or
rain
<EOS>
,
I
must
to
the
church
.
<EOS>
"Bequeathing
<EOS>
his
final
instructions
to
certain
of
the
household
who
were
to
form
part
of
the
procession
,
in
case
it
set
out
,
he
opened
the
hall
door
,
and
,
the
pelting
shower
dashing
heavily
in
his
face
,
took
his
way
up
the
avenue
,
screaming
,
as
he
strode
along
,
<EOS>
the
following
congenial
rhymes
:
<EOS>

THE
CHURCHYARDMethought
I
walked
,
about
the
mid
of
night
,
Into
a
churchyard.—Webster
:
The
White
Devil
.
<EOS>
LIGHTS
streamed
through
the
chancel
window
as
the
sexton
entered
the
churchyard
,
darkly
defining
all
the
ramified
tracery
of
the
noble
Gothic
arch
,
and
illumining
the
gorgeous
dyes
of
its
richly
-
stained
glass
,
profusely
decorated
with
the
armorial
bearings
of
the
founder
of
the
fane
,
and
the
many
alliances
of
his
descendants
.
<EOS>
The
sheen
of
their
blazonry
gleamed
bright
in
the
darkness
,
as
if
to
herald
to
his
last
home
another
of
the
line
whose
achievements
it
displayed
.
<EOS>
Glowing
colorings
,
checkered
like
rainbow
tints
,
were
shed
upon
the
broken
leaves
of
the
adjoining
yew
-
trees
,
and
upon
the
rounded
grassy
tombs
.
<EOS>
Opening
the
gate
,
as
he
looked
in
that
direction
,
Peter
became
aware
of
a
dark
figure
,
enveloped
in
a
large
black
cloak
,
and
covered
with
a
slouched
hat
,
standing
at
some
distance
,
between
the
window
and
the
tree
,
and
so
intervening
as
to
receive
the
full
influence
of
the
stream
of
radiance
which
served
to
dilate
its
almost
superhuman
stature
.
<EOS>
The
sexton
stopped
.
<EOS>
The
figure
remained
stationary
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
singular
both
in
the
costume
and
situation
of
the
person
.
<EOS>
Peter
's
curiosity
was
speedily
aroused
,
and
,
familiar
with
every
inch
of
the
churchyard
,
he
determined
to
take
the
nearest
cut
,
and
to
ascertain
to
whom
the
mysterious
cloak
and
hat
belonged
.
<EOS>
Making
his
way
over
the
undulating
graves
,
and
instinctively
rounding
the
headstones
that
intercepted
his
path
,
he
quickly
drew
near
the
object
of
his
inquiry
.
<EOS>
From
the
moveless
posture
it
maintained
,
the
figure
appeared
to
be
unconscious
of
Peter
's
approach
.
<EOS>
To
his
eyes
it
seemed
to
expand
as
he
advanced
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
almost
close
upon
it
,
when
his
progress
was
arrested
by
a
violent
grasp
laid
on
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
started
,
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
alarm
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
illumined
the
whole
churchyard
,
and
Peter
then
thought
he
beheld
,
at
some
distance
from
him
,
two
other
figures
,
bearing
upon
their
shoulders
a
huge
chest
,
or
,
it
might
be
,
a
coffin
.
<EOS>
The
garb
of
these
figures
,
so
far
as
it
could
be
discerned
through
the
drenching
rain
,
was
fantastical
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
The
foremost
seemed
to
have
a
long
white
beard
descending
to
his
girdle
.
<EOS>
Little
leisure
,
however
,
was
allowed
Peter
for
observation
.
<EOS>
The
vision
no
sooner
met
his
glance
than
it
disappeared
,
and
nothing
was
seen
but
the
glimmering
tombstones
—
nothing
heard
but
the
whistling
wind
and
the
heavily
-
descending
shower
.
<EOS>
He
rubbed
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
muffled
figure
had
vanished
,
and
not
a
trace
could
be
discovered
of
the
mysterious
coffin
-
bearers
,
if
such
they
were
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
have
I
seen
?
"
<EOS>
mentally
ejaculated
Peter
:
<EOS>
"
is
this
sorcery
or
treachery
,
or
both
?
<EOS>
No
body
-
snatchers
would
visit
this
place
on
a
night
like
this
,
when
the
whole
neighborhood
is
aroused
.
<EOS>
Can
it
be
a
vision
I
have
seen
?
<EOS>
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
shall
I
juggle
myself
as
I
deceive
these
hinds
?
<EOS>
It
was
no
bearded
demon
that
I
beheld
,
but
the
gipsy
patrico
,
Balthazar
.
<EOS>
I
knew
him
at
once
.
<EOS>
But
what
meant
that
muffled
figure
;
and
whose
arm
could
it
have
been
that
griped
my
shoulder
?
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
what
if
Lady
Rookwood
should
have
given
orders
for
the
removal
of
Susan
's
body
?
<EOS>
No
,
no
;
that
can
not
be
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
have
the
keys
of
the
vault
;
and
there
are
hundreds
now
in
the
church
who
would
permit
no
such
desecration
.
<EOS>
I
am
perplexed
to
think
what
it
can
mean
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
to
the
vault
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Saying
which
,
he
hastened
to
the
church
porch
,
and
after
wringing
the
wet
from
his
clothes
,
as
a
water
-
dog
might
shake
the
moisture
from
his
curly
hide
,
and
doffing
his
broad
felt
hat
,
he
entered
the
holy
edifice
.
<EOS>
The
interior
seemed
one
blaze
of
light
to
the
sexton
,
in
his
sudden
transition
from
outer
darkness
.
<EOS>
Some
few
persons
were
assembled
,
probably
such
as
were
engaged
in
the
preparations
;
but
there
was
one
group
which
immediately
caught
his
attention
.
<EOS>
Near
the
communion
-
table
stood
three
persons
,
habited
in
deep
mourning
,
apparently
occupied
in
examining
the
various
monumental
carvings
that
enriched
the
walls
.
<EOS>
Peter
's
office
led
him
to
that
part
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
About
to
descend
into
the
vaults
,
to
make
the
last
preparations
for
the
reception
of
the
dead
,
with
lantern
in
hand
,
keys
,
and
a
crowbar
,
he
approached
the
party
.
<EOS>
Little
attention
was
paid
to
the
sexton
's
proceedings
,
till
the
harsh
grating
of
the
lock
attracted
their
notice
.
<EOS>
Peter
started
as
he
beheld
the
face
of
one
of
the
three
,
and
relaxing
his
hold
upon
the
key
,
the
strong
bolt
shot
back
in
the
lock
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
whisper
amongst
the
party
.
<EOS>
A
light
step
was
heard
advancing
towards
him
;
and
ere
the
sexton
could
sufficiently
recover
his
surprise
,
or
force
open
the
door
,
a
female
figure
stood
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
The
keen
,
inquiring
stare
which
Peter
bestowed
upon
the
countenance
of
the
young
lady
so
much
abashed
her
,
that
she
hesitated
in
her
purpose
of
addressing
him
,
and
hastily
retired
.
<EOS>
"She
<EOS>
here
!
<EOS>
"
muttered
Peter
;
"
nay
,
then
,
I
must
no
longer
withhold
the
dreaded
secret
from
Luke
,
or
Ranulph
may
,
indeed
,
wrest
his
possessions
from
him
.
<EOS>
"Reinforced
<EOS>
by
her
companions
,
an
elderly
lady
and
a
tall
,
handsome
man
,
whose
bearing
and
deportment
bespoke
him
to
be
a
soldier
,
the
fair
stranger
again
ventured
towards
Peter
.
<EOS>
"You
are
the
sexton
,
"
said
she
,
addressing
him
in
a
voice
sweet
and
musical
.
<EOS>
"I
am
,
"
returned
Peter
.
<EOS>
It
was
harmony
succeeded
by
dissonance
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
,
perhaps
,
can
tell
us
,
then
,
"
said
the
elderly
lady
,
"
whether
the
funeral
is
likely
to
take
place
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
We
thought
it
possible
that
the
storm
might
altogether
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
storm
is
over
,
as
nearly
as
maybe
,
"
replied
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
The
body
will
soon
be
on
its
way
.
<EOS>
I
am
but
now
arrived
from
the
hall
.
""Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
None
of
the
family
will
be
present
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
Who
is
the
chief
mourner?""Young
Sir
Ranulph
,
"
answered
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"
There
will
be
more
of
the
family
than
were
expected
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
Sir
Ranulph
returned
?
"
asked
the
young
lady
,
with
great
agitation
of
manner
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
he
was
abroad
—
that
he
was
not
expected
.
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
you
are
rightly
informed?""I
parted
with
him
at
the
hall
not
ten
minutes
since
,
"
replied
Peter
.
"
<EOS>
He
returned
from
France
to
-
night
most
unexpectedly
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
mother
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
younger
lady
,
"
that
this
should
be
—
that
I
should
meet
him
here
.
<EOS>
Why
did
we
come?—let
us
depart
.
""Impossible
!
<EOS>
"
replied
her
mother
;
"
the
storm
forbids
it
.
<EOS>
This
man
's
information
is
so
strange
,
I
scarce
can
credit
it
.
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
you
have
asserted
the
truth
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
addressing
Peter
.
<EOS>
"I
am
not
accustomed
to
be
doubted
,
"
answered
he
.
"
<EOS>
Other
things
as
strange
have
happened
at
the
hall
.
<EOS>
""What
mean
you
?
"
asked
the
gentleman
,
noticing
this
last
remark
.
<EOS>
"You
would
not
need
to
ask
the
question
of
me
,
had
you
been
there
,
amongst
the
other
guests
,
"
retorted
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Odd
things
<EOS>
,
I
tell
you
,
have
been
done
there
this
night
,
and
stranger
things
may
occur
before
the
morning
.
<EOS>
""You
are
insolent
,
sirrah
!
<EOS>
I
comprehend
you
not
.
<EOS>
""Enough
!
<EOS>
I
can
comprehend
you
,
"
replied
Peter
,
significantly
;
"
<EOS>
I
know
the
count
of
the
mourners
invited
to
this
ceremonial
,
and
I
am
aware
that
there
are
three
too
many
.
<EOS>
""Know
<EOS>
you
this
saucy
knave
<EOS>
,
mother?""I
can
not
call
him
to
mind
,
though
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
have
seen
him
before
.
<EOS>
""My
recollection
serves
me
better
,
lady
,
"
interposed
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
one
who
was
once
the
proud
heiress
of
Rookwood
—
<EOS>
ay
,
proud
and
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Then
the
house
was
filled
with
her
gallant
suitors
.
<EOS>
Swords
were
crossed
for
her
.
<EOS>
Hearts
bled
for
her
.
<EOS>
Yet
she
favored
none
,
until
one
hapless
hour
.
<EOS>
Sir
Reginald
Rookwood
had
a
daughter
;
Sir
Reginald
lost
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
Ha!—I
<EOS>
see
I
am
right
.
<EOS>
Well
,
he
is
dead
and
buried
;
and
Reginald
,
his
son
,
is
dead
likewise
;
and
Piers
is
on
his
road
hither
;
and
you
are
the
last
,
as
in
the
course
of
nature
you
might
have
been
the
first
.
<EOS>
And
,
now
that
they
are
all
gone
,
you
do
rightly
to
bury
your
grievances
with
them
.
<EOS>
""Silence
,
sirrah
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
gentleman
,
"
or
I
will
beat
your
brains
out
with
your
own
spade
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
;
let
him
speak
,
Vavasour
,
"
said
the
lady
,
with
an
expression
of
anguish—"he
has
awakened
thoughts
of
other
days
.
<EOS>
""I
have
done
,
"
said
Peter
,
"
and
must
to
work
.
<EOS>
Will
you
descend
with
me

Mowbray
signified
her
assent
,
and
the
party
prepared
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
The
sexton
held
the
lantern
so
as
to
throw
its
light
upon
the
steps
as
they
entered
the
gloomy
receptacle
of
the
departed
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
half
repented
having
ventured
within
its
dreary
limits
,
so
much
did
the
appearance
of
the
yawning
catacombs
,
surcharged
with
mortality
,
and
,
above
all
,
the
ghostly
figure
of
the
grim
knight
,
affect
her
with
dread
,
as
she
looked
wistfully
around
.
<EOS>
She
required
all
the
support
her
brother
's
arm
could
afford
her
;
nor
was
Mrs.
Mowbray
altogether
unmoved
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
all
the
family
are
here
interred
,
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
latter
.
<EOS>
"All
,
"
replied
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"Where
,
then
,
lies
Sir
Reginald
's
younger
brother?""Who
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Peter
,
starting
.
<EOS>
"Alan
<EOS>
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
""What
of
him?""Nothing
of
moment
.
<EOS>
But
I
thought
you
could
,
perhaps
,
inform
me
.
<EOS>
He
died
young
.
<EOS>
""He
did
,
"
replied
Peter
,
in
an
altered
tone—"very
young
;
but
not
before
he
had
lived
to
an
old
age
of
wretchedness
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
his
story
,
madam?""I
have
heard
it
.
<EOS>
""From
<EOS>
your
father
's
lips?""From
Sir
Reginald
Rookwood's
—
never
.
<EOS>
Call
him
not
my
father
,
sirrah
;
even
here
I
will
not
have
him
named
so
to
me
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
pardon
,
madam
,
"
returned
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"
Great
cruelty
was
shown
to
the
Lady
Eleanor
,
and
may
well
call
forth
implacable
resentment
in
her
child
;
yet
methinks
the
wrong
he
did
<EOS>
his
brother
Alan
was
the
foulest
stain
with
which
Sir
Reginald
's
black
soul
was
dyed
.
<EOS>
""With
<EOS>
what
particular
wrong
dost
thou
charge
Sir
Reginald
?
"
demanded
Major
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
"
What
injury
did
he
inflict
upon
his
brother
Alan?""He
wronged
his
brother
's
honor
,
"
replied
the
sexton
;
"
he
robbed
him
of
his
wife
,
poisoned
his
existence
,
and
hurried
him
to
an
untimely
grave
.
<EOS>
"Eleanor
<EOS>
shudderingly
held
back
during
this
horrible
narration
,
the
hearing
of
which
she
would
willingly
have
shunned
,
had
it
been
possible
.
<EOS>
"Can
<EOS>
this
be
true
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
major
.
"Too
<EOS>
true
,
my
son
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
sorrowfully
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
where
lies
the
unfortunate
Alan
?
"
asked
Major
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
"'Twixt
two
cross
roads
.
<EOS>
Where
else
should
the
suicide
lie?"Evading
any
further
question
,
Peter
hastily
traversed
the
vault
,
elevating
the
light
so
as
to
reveal
the
contents
of
each
cell
.
<EOS>
One
circumstance
filled
him
with
surprise
and
dismay
—
he
could
nowhere
perceive
the
coffin
of
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
In
vain
he
peered
into
every
catacomb
—
they
were
apparently
undisturbed
;
and
,
with
much
internal
marvelling
and
misgiving
,
Peter
gave
up
the
search
.
<EOS>
"
That
vision
is
now
explained
,
"
muttered
he
;
"
the
body
is
removed
,
but
by
whom
?
<EOS>
Death
!
<EOS>
can
I
doubt
?
<EOS>
It
must
be
Lady
Rookwood
—
who
else
can
have
any
interest
in
its
removal
.
<EOS>
She
has
acted
boldly
.
<EOS>
But
she
shall
yet
have
reason
to
repent
her
temerity
.
<EOS>
"
As
he
continued
his
search
,
his
companions
silently
followed
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
stopped
,
and
,
signifying
that
all
was
finished
,
they
not
unwillingly
quitted
this
abode
of
horror
,
leaving
him
behind
them
.
<EOS>
"It
is
a
dreadful
place
,
"
whispered
Eleanor
to
her
mother
;
"
nor
would
I
have
visited
it
,
<EOS>
had
I
conceived
anything
of
its
horrors
.
<EOS>
And
that
strange
man
!
<EOS>
who
or
what
is
he?""Ay
,
who
is
he
?
"
repeated
Major
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
recollect
him
now
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Mowbray
;
"
he
is
one
who
has
ever
been
connected
with
the
family
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
daughter
,
whose
beauty
was
her
ruin
:
<EOS>
it
is
a
sad
tale
;
I
can
not
tell
it
now
:
you
have
heard
enough
of
misery
and
guilt
:
but
that
may
account
for
his
bitterness
of
speech
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
dependent
upon
my
poor
brother
.
<EOS>
""Poor
man
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Eleanor
;
"
if
he
has
been
unfortunate
,
I
pity
him
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
we
have
been
into
that
dreadful
place
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
faint
:
and
I
tremble
more
than
ever
at
the
thought
of
meeting
Ranulph
Rookwood
again
.
<EOS>
I
can
scarcely
support
myself
—
I
am
sure
I
shall
not
venture
to
look
upon
him
.
<EOS>
""Had
<EOS>
I
dreamed
of
the
likelihood
of
his
attending
the
ceremony
,
rest
assured
,
<EOS>
dear
Eleanor
,
we
should
not
have
been
here
:
but
I
was
informed
there
was
no
possibility
of
his
return
.
<EOS>
Compose
yourself
,
my
child
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
trying
time
to
both
of
us
;
but
it
is
now
inevitable
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
the
bell
began
to
toll
.
<EOS>
"
The
procession
has
started
,
"
said
Peter
,
as
he
passed
the
Mowbrays
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
bell
announces
the
setting
out
.
<EOS>
""See
<EOS>
yonder
persons
hurrying
to
the
door
,
"
exclaimed
Eleanor
,
with
eagerness
,
and
trembling
violently
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
coming
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
able
to
go
through
with
it
,
dear
mother
.
<EOS>
"Peter
<EOS>
hastened
to
the
church
door
,
where
he
stationed
himself
,
in
company
with
a
host
of
others
,
equally
curious
.
<EOS>
Flickering
lights
in
the
distance
,
shining
like
stars
through
the
trees
,
showed
them
that
the
procession
was
collecting
in
front
of
the
hall
.
<EOS>
The
rain
had
now
entirely
ceased
;
the
thunder
muttered
from
afar
,
and
the
lightning
seemed
only
to
lick
the
moisture
from
the
trees
.
<EOS>
The
bell
continued
to
toll
,
and
its
loud
booming
awoke
the
drowsy
echoes
of
the
valley
.
<EOS>
On
the
sudden
,
a
solitary
,
startling
concussion
of
thunder
was
heard
;
and
presently
a
man
rushed
down
from
the
belfry
,
with
the
tidings
that
he
had
seen
a
ball
of
fire
fall
from
a
cloud
right
over
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Every
ear
was
on
the
alert
for
the
next
sound
;
none
was
heard
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
crisis
of
the
storm
.
<EOS>
Still
the
funeral
procession
advanced
not
.
<EOS>
The
strong
sheen
of
the
torchlight
was
still
visible
from
the
bottom
of
the
avenue
,
now
disappearing
,
now
brightly
glimmering
,
as
if
the
bearers
were
hurrying
to
and
fro
amongst
the
trees
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
that
much
confusion
prevailed
,
and
that
some
misadventure
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
Each
man
muttered
to
his
neighbor
,
and
few
were
there
who
had
not
in
a
measure
surmised
the
cause
of
the
delay
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
a
person
without
his
hat
,
breathless
with
haste
and
almost
palsied
with
fright
,
rushed
through
the
midst
of
them
and
,
stumbling
over
the
threshold
,
fell
headlong
into
the
church
.
<EOS>
"What
's
the
matter
,
Master
Plant
?
<EOS>
What
has
happened
?
<EOS>
Tell
us
!
<EOS>
Tell
us
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
several
voices
simultaneously
.
<EOS>
"Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Plant
,
gasping
for
utterance
,
and
not
attempting
to
raise
himself
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
horrible
!
<EOS>
dreadful
!
<EOS>
oh!—oh!""What
has
happened
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Peter
,
approaching
the
fallen
man
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
dost
thou
need
to
ask
,
Peter
Bradley
?
<EOS>
thou
,
who
foretold
it
all
?
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
say
what
I
think
,
though
my
tongue
itches
to
tell
thee
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Be
satisfied
,
thy
wizard
's
lore
has
served
thee
right
—
he
is
dead
.
<EOS>
""Who
?
<EOS>
Ranulph
Rookwood
?
<EOS>
Has
anything
befallen
him
,
or
the
prisoner
,
Luke
Bradley
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
sexton
,
with
eagerness
.
<EOS>
A
scream
here
burst
forth
from
one
who
was
standing
behind
the
group
;
and
,
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
her
mother
to
withhold
her
,
Eleanor
Mowbray
rushed
forward
.
<EOS>
"Has
<EOS>
aught
happened
to
Sir
Ranulph
?
"
<EOS>
asked
she
.
<EOS>
"Noa
<EOS>
—
noa
—
not
to
Sir
Ranulph
—
he
be
with
the
body
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
be
thanked
for
that
!
"
exclaimed
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
as
if
ashamed
of
her
own
vehemence
,
and
,
it
might
seem
,
apparent
indifference
to
another
's
fate
,
she
inquired
who
was
hurt
.
<EOS>
"It
be
poor
neighbor
Toft
,
that
be
killed
by
a
thunderbolt
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
Plant
.
<EOS>
Exclamations
of
horror
burst
from
all
around
.
<EOS>
No
one
was
more
surprised
at
this
intelligence
than
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
Like
many
other
seers
,
he
had
not
,
in
all
probability
,
calculated
upon
the
fulfilment
of
his
predictions
,
and
he
now
stared
aghast
at
the
extent
of
his
own
foreknowledge
.
<EOS>
"I
tell
'
ee
what
,
Master
Peter
,
"
said
Plant
,
shaking
his
bullet
-
head
,
"
it
be
well
for
thee
thou
did
n't
live
in
my
grandfather
's
time
,
or
thou'dst
ha
'
been
ducked
in
a
blanket
;
or
may
be
burnt
at
the
stake
,
like
Ridley
and
Latimer
,
as
we
read
on
—
but
however
that
may
be
,
ye
shall
hear
how
poor
Toft
's
death
came
to
pass
,
and
nobody
can
tell
'
ee
better
nor
I
,
seeing
I
were
near
to
him
,
poor
fellow
,
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
Well
,
we
thought
as
how
the
storm
were
all
over
—
and
had
all
got
into
order
of
march
,
and
were
just
beginning
to
step
up
the
avenue
,
the
coffin
-
bearers
pushing
lustily
along
,
and
the
torches
shining
grandly
,
when
poor
Simon
Toft
,
who
could
never
travel
well
in
liquor
in
his
life
,
reeled
to
one
side
,
and
staggering
against
the
first
huge
lime
-
tree
,
sat
himself
down
beneath
it
—
<EOS>
thou
knowest
the
tree
I
mean
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
tree
of
fate
,
"
returned
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
I
ought
,
methinks
,
to
know
it
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
I
were
just
stepping
aside
to
pick
him
up
,
when
all
at
once
there
comes
such
a
crack
of
thunder
,
and
,
whizzing
through
the
trees
,
flashed
a
great
globe
of
red
fire
,
so
bright
and
dazzlin
'
<EOS>
,
it
nearly
blinded
me
;
and
when
I
opened
my
eyes
,
winkin
'
and
waterin
'
,
I
see'd
that
which
blinded
me
more
even
than
the
flash
—
that
which
had
just
afore
been
poor
Simon
,
but
which
was
now
a
mass
o
'
black
smouldering
ashes
,
clean
consumed
and
destroyed
—
his
clothes
rent
to
a
thousand
tatters
—
the
earth
and
stones
tossed
up
,
and
scattered
all
about
,
and
a
great
splinter
of
the
tree
lying
beside
him
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
's
will
be
done
!
"
said
the
sexton
;
"
this
is
an
awful
judgment
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
Sathan
cast
down
;
for
this
is
a
spice
o
'
his
handiwork
,
"
muttered
Plant
;
adding
,
as
he
slunk
away
,
"
If
ever
Peter
Bradley
do
come
to
the
blanket
,
dang
me
if
I
do

<EOS>
THE
FUNERALHow
like
a
silent
stream
,
shaded
by
night
,
And
gliding
softly
with
our
windy
sighs
<EOS>
,
Moves
the
whole
frame
of
this
solemnity!Tears
,
sighs
,
and
blacks
,
filling
the
simile!Whilst
<EOS>
I
,
the
only
murmur
in
this
groveOf
death
,
thus
hollowly
break
forth
.
<EOS>
The
Fatal
Dowry
.
<EOS>
WORD
being
given
that
the
funeral
train
was
fast
approaching
,
the
church
door
was
thrown
open
,
and
the
assemblage
divided
in
two
lines
,
to
allow
it
admission
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
a
striking
change
had
taken
place
,
even
in
this
brief
period
,
in
the
appearance
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
The
sky
,
heretofore
curtained
with
darkness
,
was
now
illumined
by
a
serene
,
soft
moon
,
which
,
floating
in
a
watery
halo
,
tinged
with
silvery
radiance
the
edges
of
a
few
ghostly
clouds
that
hurried
along
the
deep
and
starlit
skies
.
<EOS>
The
suddenness
of
the
change
could
not
fail
to
excite
surprise
and
admiration
,
mingled
with
regret
that
the
procession
had
not
been
delayed
until
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
Slowly
and
mournfully
the
train
was
seen
to
approach
the
churchyard
,
winding
,
two
by
two
,
with
melancholy
step
,
around
the
corner
of
the
road
.
<EOS>
First
came
Dr.
Small
;
then
the
mutes
,
with
their
sable
panoply
;
next
,
the
torch
-
bearers
;
next
,
those
who
sustained
the
coffin
,
bending
beneath
their
ponderous
burden
,
followed
by
Sir
Ranulph
and
a
long
line
of
attendants
,
all
plainly
to
be
distinguished
by
the
flashing
torchlight
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
slight
halt
at
the
gate
,
and
the
coffin
changed
supporters
.
<EOS>
"Ill
<EOS>
luck
betide
them
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Peter
;
"
could
they
find
no
other
place
except
that
to
halt
at
?
<EOS>
Must
Sir
Piers
be
gatekeeper
till
next
Yule
!
<EOS>
No
,
"
added
he
,
seeing
what
followed
;
"
it
will
be
poor
Toft
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
"Following
<EOS>
close
upon
the
coffin
came
a
rude
shell
,
containing
,
as
Peter
rightly
conjectured
,
the
miserable
remains
of
Simon
Toft
,
who
had
met
his
fate
in
the
manner
described
by
Plant
.
<EOS>
The
bolt
of
death
glanced
from
the
tree
which
it
first
struck
,
and
reduced
the
unfortunate
farmer
to
a
heap
of
dust
.
<EOS>
Universal
consternation
prevailed
,
and
doubts
were
entertained
as
to
what
course
should
be
pursued
.
<EOS>
It
was
judged
best
by
Dr.
Small
to
remove
the
remains
at
once
to
the
charnel
-
house
.
<EOS>
Thus
"
unanointed
,
unaneled
,
with
all
his
imperfections
on
his
head
,
"
was
poor
Simon
Toft
,
in
one
brief
second
,
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
,
plunged
from
the
height
of
festivity
to
the
darkness
of
the
grave
,
and
so
horribly
disfigured
,
that
scarce
a
vestige
of
humanity
was
discernible
in
the
mutilated
mass
that
remained
of
him
.
<EOS>
Truly
may
we
be
said
to
walk
in
blindness
,
and
amidst
deep
pitfalls
.
<EOS>
The
churchyard
was
thronged
by
the
mournful
train
.
<EOS>
The
long
array
of
dusky
figures
—
the
waving
torchlight
gleaming
ruddily
in
the
white
moonshine
—
now
glistening
upon
the
sombre
habiliments
of
the
bearers
,
and
on
their
shrouded
load
,
now
reflected
upon
the
jagged
branches
of
the
yew
-
trees
,
or
falling
upon
the
ivied
buttresses
of
the
ancient
church
,
constituted
no
unimpressive
picture
.
<EOS>
Over
all
,
like
a
lamp
hung
in
the
still
sky
,
shone
the
moon
,
shedding
a
soothing
,
spiritual
lustre
over
the
scene
.
<EOS>
The
organ
broke
into
a
solemn
strain
as
the
coffin
was
borne
along
the
mid
-
aisle
—
the
mourners
following
,
with
reverent
step
,
and
slow
.
<EOS>
It
was
deposited
near
the
mouth
of
the
vault
,
the
whole
assemblage
circling
around
it
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Small
proceeded
with
the
performance
of
that
magnificent
service
appointed
for
the
burial
of
the
dead
,
in
a
tone
as
remarkable
for
its
sadness
as
for
its
force
and
fervor
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
tear
in
every
eye
—
a
cloud
on
every
brow
.
<EOS>
Brightly
illumined
as
was
the
whole
building
,
there
were
still
some
recesses
which
,
owing
to
the
intervention
of
heavy
pillars
,
were
thrown
into
shade
;
and
in
one
of
these
,
supported
by
her
mother
and
brother
,
stood
Eleanor
,
a
weeping
witness
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
She
beheld
the
coffin
silently
borne
along
;
she
saw
one
dark
figure
slowly
following
;
she
knew
those
pale
features
—
<EOS>
oh
,
how
pale
they
were
!
<EOS>
A
year
had
wrought
a
fearful
alteration
;
she
could
scarce
credit
what
she
beheld
.
<EOS>
He
must
,
indeed
,
have
suffered
—
deeply
suffered
;
and
her
heart
told
her
that
his
sorrows
had
been
for
her
.
<EOS>
Many
a
wistful
look
,
besides
,
was
directed
to
the
principal
figure
in
this
ceremonial
,
Ranulph
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
prey
to
unutterable
anguish
of
soul
;
his
heart
bled
inwardly
for
the
father
he
had
lost
.
<EOS>
Mechanically
following
the
body
down
the
aisle
,
he
had
taken
his
station
near
it
,
gazing
with
confused
vision
upon
the
bystanders
;
had
listened
,
with
a
sad
composure
,
to
the
expressive
delivery
of
Small
,
until
he
read—"For
man
walketh
in
a
vain
shadow
,
and
disquieteth
himself
in
vain
;
he
heapeth
up
riches
,
and
can
not
tell
who
shall
gather
them
.
<EOS>
""Verily
!
"
exclaimed
a
deep
voice
;
and
Ranulph
,
looking
round
,
met
the
eyes
of
Peter
Bradley
fixed
full
upon
him
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
evidently
not
the
sexton
who
had
spoken
.
<EOS>
Small
continued
the
service
.
<EOS>
He
arrived
at
this
verse
:
"
Thou
hast
set
our
misdeeds
before
thee
;
and
our
secret
sins
in
the
light
of
thy
countenance
.
<EOS>
""Even
<EOS>
so
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
voice
;
and
as
Ranulph
raised
his
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
,
he
thought
he
saw
a
dark
figure
,
muffled
in
a
cloak
,
disappear
behind
one
of
the
pillars
.
<EOS>
He
bestowed
,
however
,
at
the
moment
,
little
thought
upon
this
incident
.
<EOS>
His
heart
melted
within
him
;
and
leaning
his
face
upon
his
hand
,
he
wept
aloud
.
<EOS>
"Command
<EOS>
yourself
,
I
entreat
of
you
,
my
dear
Sir
Ranulph
,
"
said
Dr.
Small
,
as
soon
as
the
service
was
finished
,
"
and
suffer
this
melancholy
ceremonial
to
be
completed
.
<EOS>
"
Saying
which
,
he
gently
withdrew
Ranulph
from
his
support
,
and
the
coffin
was
lowered
into
the
vault
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
remained
for
some
time
in
the
extremity
of
sorrow
.
<EOS>
When
he
in
part
recovered
,
the
crowd
had
dispersed
,
and
few
persons
were
remaining
within
the
church
;
yet
near
him
stood
three
apparent
loiterers
.
<EOS>
They
advanced
towards
him
.
<EOS>
An
exclamation
of
surprise
and
joy
burst
from
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"Eleanor!""Ranulph!""Is
<EOS>
it
possible
?
<EOS>
Do
I
indeed
behold
you
,
Eleanor?"No
<EOS>
other
word
was
spoken
.
<EOS>
They
rushed
into
each
other
's
arms
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
sad
—
sad
is
the
lover
's
parting
—
<EOS>
no
pang
<EOS>
so
keen
;
but
if
life
hath
a
zest
more
exquisite
than
others
—
if
felicity
hath
one
drop
more
racy
than
the
rest
in
her
honeyed
cup
<EOS>
,
it
is
the
happiness
enjoyed
in
such
a
union
as
the
present
.
<EOS>
To
say
that
he
was
as
one
raised
from
the
depths
of
misery
by
some
angel
comforter
,
were
a
feeble
comparison
of
the
transport
of
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
To
paint
the
thrilling
delight
of
Eleanor
—
the
trembling
tenderness
—
the
fond
abandonment
which
vanquished
all
her
maiden
scruples
,
would
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
Reluctantly
yielding
—
fearing
,
yet
complying
,
her
lips
were
sealed
in
one
long
,
loving
kiss
,
the
sanctifying
pledge
of
their
tried
affection
.
"Eleanor
,
dear
Eleanor
,
"
exclaimed
Ranulph
,
"
though
I
hold
you
within
my
arms
—
though
each
nerve
within
my
frame
assures
me
of
your
presence
—
though
I
look
into
those
eyes
,
which
seem
fraught
with
greater
endearment
than
ever
I
have
known
them
wear
—
though
I
see
and
feel
and
know
all
this
,
so
sudden
,
so
unlooked
for
is
the
happiness
,
that
I
could
almost
doubt
its
reality
.
<EOS>
Say
to
what
blessed
circumstance
I
am
indebted
for
this
unlooked
-
for
happiness
.
<EOS>
""We
are
staying
not
far
hence
,
with
friends
,
dear
Ranulph
;
and
my
mother
,
hearing
of
Sir
Piers
Rookwood
's
death
,
and
wishing
to
bury
all
animosity
with
him
,
resolved
to
be
present
at
the
sad
ceremony
.
<EOS>
We
were
told
you
could
not
be
here
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
would
my
presence
have
prevented
your
attendance
,
Eleanor?""Not
that
,
dear
Ranulph
;
but——""But
what?"At
this
moment
the
advance
of
Mrs.
Mowbray
offered
an
interruption
to
their
further
discourse
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
son
<EOS>
and
I
appear
to
be
secondary
in
your
regards
,
Sir
Ranulph
,
"
said
she
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
Ranulph
!
"
<EOS>
mentally
echoed
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
"
What
will
shethink
when
she
knows
that
that
title
is
not
mine
?
<EOS>
I
dread
to
tell
her
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
added
aloud
,
with
a
melancholy
smile
,
"
I
crave
your
pardon
,
madam
;
the
delight
of
a
meeting
so
unexpected
with
your
daughter
must
plead
my
apology
.
<EOS>
""None
is
wanting
,
Sir
Ranulph
,
"
said
Major
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
"
I
who
have
known
what
separation
from
my
sister
is
,
can
readily
excuse
your
feelings
.
<EOS>
But
you
look
ill
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
have
,
indeed
,
experienced
much
mental
anxiety
,
"
said
Ranulph
,
looking
at
Eleanor
;
"
it
is
now
past
,
and
I
would
fain
hope
that
a
brighter
day
is
dawning
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
heart
answered
,
'
twas
but
a
hope
.
<EOS>
"You
were
unlooked
for
here
to
-
night
,
Sir
Ranulph
,
"
said
Mrs.
Mowbray
;
"
by
us
,
at
least
:
we
were
told
you
were
abroad
.
<EOS>
""You
were
rightly
informed
,
madam
,
"
replied
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
arrived
this
evening
from
Bordeaux
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
you
are
returned
.
<EOS>
We
are
at
present
on
a
visit
with
your
neighbors
,
the
Davenhams
,
at
Braybrook
,
and
trust
<EOS>
we
shall
see
you
there
.
<EOS>
""I
will
ride
over
to
-
morrow
,
"
replied
Ranulph
;
"
there
is
much
on
which
I
would
consult
you
all
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
ventured
to
request
the
favor
of
your
company
at
Rookwood
,
had
the
occasion
been
other
than
the
present
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
would
willingly
have
accepted
your
invitation
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Mowbray
;
"
I
should
like
to
see
the
old
house
once
more
.
<EOS>
During
your
father
's
lifetime
I
could
not
approach
it
.
<EOS>
You
are
lord
of
broad
lands
,
Sir
Ranulph
—
a
goodly
inheritance
.
<EOS>
""Madam!""And
<EOS>
a
proud
title
,
which
you
will
grace
well
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
not
.
<EOS>
The
first
,
the
noblest
of
our
house
,
was
he
from
whom
you
derive
your
name
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
third
Sir
Ranulph
;
the
first
founded
the
house
of
Rookwood
;
the
next
advanced
it
;
'
tis
for
you
to
raise
its
glory
to
its
height
.
<EOS>
""Alas
!
<EOS>
madam
,
I
have
no
such
thought
.
<EOS>
""Wherefore
<EOS>
not
?
<EOS>
you
are
young
,
wealthy
,
powerful
.
<EOS>
With
such
domains
as
those
of
Rookwood
—
with
such
a
title
as
its
lord
can
claim
,
naught
should
be
too
high
for
your
aspirations
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
aspire
to
nothing
,
madam
,
but
your
daughter
's
hand
;
and
even
that
I
will
not
venture
to
solicit
until
you
are
acquainted
with
—
—
"
And
he
hesitated
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"A
singular
,
and
to
me
most
perplexing
event
has
occurred
to
-
night
,
"
replied
Ranulph
,
"
which
may
materially
affect
my
future
fortunes
.
""Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
"
Does
it
relate
to
your
mother?""Excuse
my
answering
the
question
now
,
madam
,
"
<EOS>
replied
Ranulph
;
"
you
shall
know
all
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
to
-
morrow
,
dear
Ranulph
,
"
said
Eleanor
;
"
and
whatever
that
morrow
may
bring
forth
,
it
will
bring
happiness
to
me
,
if
you
are
bearer
of
the
tidings
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
expect
your
coming
with
impatience
,
"
said
Mrs.
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
I
,
"
added
Major
Mowbray
,
who
had
listened
thus
far
in
silence
,
"
would
offer
you
my
services
in
any
way
you
think
they
would
be
useful
.
<EOS>
Command
me
as
you
think
fitting
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
thank
you
heartily
,
"
returned
Ranulph
.
"
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
you
shall
learn
all
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
it
shall
be
my
business
to
investigate
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
the
statement
I
have
heard
,
ere
I
report
it
to
you

<EOS>
Till
then
,
farewell
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
they
issued
from
the
church
it
was
gray
dawn
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Mowbray
's
carriage
stood
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
party
entered
it
;
and
accompanied
by
Dr.
Small
,
whom
he
found
within
in
the
vestry
,
Ranulph
walked
towards
the
hall
,
where
a
fresh
surprise
awaited
him

"Arden
of
Feversham
.
<EOS>
GUARDED
by
the
two
young
farmers
who
had
displayed
so
much
address
in
seizing
him
,
Luke
,
meanwhile
,
had
been
conveyed
in
safety
to
the
small
chamber
in
the
eastern
wing
,
destined
by
Mr.
Coates
to
be
his
place
of
confinement
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
The
room
,
or
rather
closet
,
opening
from
another
room
,
was
extremely
well
adapted
for
the
purpose
,
having
no
perceptible
outlet
;
being
defended
,
on
either
side
,
by
thick
partition
walls
of
the
hardest
oak
,
and
at
the
extremity
by
the
solid
masonry
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
in
fact
,
a
remnant
of
the
building
anterior
to
the
first
Sir
Ranulph
's
day
;
and
the
narrow
limits
of
Luke
's
cell
had
been
erected
long
before
the
date
of
his
earliest
progenitor
.
<EOS>
Having
seen
their
prisoner
safely
bestowed
,
the
room
was
carefully
examined
,
every
board
sounded
,
every
crevice
and
corner
peered
into
by
the
curious
eye
of
the
little
lawyer
;
and
nothing
being
found
insecure
,
the
light
was
removed
,
the
door
locked
,
the
rustic
constables
dismissed
,
and
a
brace
of
pistols
having
been
loaded
and
laid
on
the
table
,
Mr.
Coates
pronounced
himself
thoroughly
satisfied
and
quite
comfortable
.
<EOS>
Comfortable
!
<EOS>
Titus
heaved
a
sigh
as
he
echoed
the
word
.
<EOS>
He
felt
anything
but
comfortable
.
<EOS>
His
heart
was
with
the
body
all
the
while
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
the
splendor
of
the
funeral
,
the
torches
,
the
illumined
church
,
his
own
dignified
march
down
the
aisle
,
and
the
effect
he
expected
to
produce
amongst
the
bewildered
rustics
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
all
these
things
,
and
cursed
Luke
by
all
the
saints
in
the
calendar
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
the
musty
old
apartment
,
hung
round
with
faded
arras
,
which
,
as
he
said
,
"
smelt
of
nothing
but
rats
and
ghosts
,
and
suchlike
varmint
,
"
did
not
serve
to
inspirit
him
;
and
the
proper
equilibrium
of
his
temper
was
not
completely
restored
until
the
appearance
of
the
butler
,
with
all
the
requisites
for
the
manufacture
of
punch
,
afforded
him
some
prospective
solace
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
what
are
they
about
now
,
Tim
?
"
asked
Titus
.
"All
<EOS>
as
jolly
as
can
be
,
"
answered
the
domestic
;
"
Dr.
Small
is
just
about
to
pronounce
the
funeral
'
ration
.
<EOS>
""Devil
<EOS>
take
it
,
"
ejaculated
Titus
,
"
there
's
another
miss
!
<EOS>
Could
n't
I
just
slip
out
,
and
hear
that?""On
<EOS>
no
account
,
"
said
Coates
.
<EOS>
"
Consider
,
Sir
Ranulph
is
there
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
well
,
"
rejoined
Titus
,
heaving
a
deep
sigh
,
and
squeezing
a
lemon
;
"
are
you
sure
this
is
biling
water
,
Tim
?
<EOS>
You
know
,
I
'm
mighty
particular

<EOS>
""Perfectly
aware

it

<EOS>
""Ah
,
Tim
,
do
you
recollect
the
way
I
used
to
brew
for
poor
Sir
Piers
,
with
a
bunch
of
red
currants
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
?
<EOS>
And
then
to
think
that
,
after
all
,
I
should
be
left
out
of
his
funeral
<EOS>
—
it
's
the
height
of
barbarity
.
<EOS>
Tim
,
this
rum
of
yours
is
poor
stuff
—
there
's
no
punch
worth
the
trouble
of
drinking
,

whisky

punch

<EOS>
A
glass
of
right
potheen
,
straw
-
color
,
peat
-
flavor
,
ten
degrees
over
proof
,
would
be
the
only
thing
to
drown
my
cares
.
<EOS>
Any
such
thing
in
the
cellar
?
<EOS>
There
used
to
be
an
odd
bottle
or
so
,
Tim
—
in
the
left
bin
,
near
the
door
.
<EOS>
""I've
<EOS>
a
notion
there
be
,
"
returned
Timothy
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
try
the
bin
your
honor
mentions
,
and
if
I
can
lay
hands
upon
a
bottle
you
shall
have
it
,
you
may
depend
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
butler
departed
,
and
Titus
,
emulating
Mr.
Coates
,
who
had
already
enveloped
himself
,
like
Juno
at
the
approach
of
Ixion
,
in
a
cloud
,
proceeded
to
light
his
pipe
.
<EOS>
Luke
,
meanwhile
,
had
been
left
alone
,
without
light
.
<EOS>
He
had
much
to
meditate
upon
,
and
with
naught
to
check
the
current
of
his
thoughts
,
he
pensively
revolved
his
present
situation
and
future
prospects
.
<EOS>
The
future
was
gloomy
enough
—
the
present
fraught
with
danger
.
<EOS>
And
now
that
the
fever
of
excitement
was
passed
,
he
severely
reproached
himself
for
his
precipitancy
.
<EOS>
His
mind
,
by
degrees
,
assumed
a
more
tranquil
state
;
and
,
exhausted
with
his
great
previous
fatigue
,
he
threw
himself
upon
the
floor
of
his
prison
-
house
,
and
addressed
himself
to
slumber
.
<EOS>
The
noise
he
made
induced
Coates
to
enter
the
room
,
which
he
did
with
a
pistol
in
each
hand
,
followed
by
Titus
with
a
pipe
and
candle
;
but
finding
all
safe
the
sentinels
retired
.
<EOS>
"One
may
see
,
with
half
an
eye
,
that
you
're
not
used
to
a
feather
-
bed
,
my
friend
,
"
said
Titus
,
as
the
door
was
locked
.
<EOS>
"
By
the
powers
,
he
's
a
tall
chap
,
anyhow
—
why
his
feet
almost
touch
the
door
.
<EOS>
I
should
say
that
room
was
a
matter
of
six
feet
long
,
Mr.
Coates
.
<EOS>
""Exactly
<EOS>
six
feet
,
sir
.
<EOS>
""Well
<EOS>
,
that
's
a
good
guess
.
<EOS>
Hang
that
ugly
rascal
,
<EOS>
Tim
;
he
's
never
brought
the
whisky
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
be
even
with
him
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Could
n't
you
just
see
to
the
prisoner
for
ten
minutes
,
Mr.
Coates?""Not
ten
seconds
.
<EOS>
I
shall
report
you
,
if
you
stir
from
your
post
.
<EOS>
"Here
<EOS>
the
door
was
opened
,
and
Tim
entered
with
the
whisky
.
<EOS>
"Arrah
!
<EOS>
by
my
soul
,
Tim
,
and
here
you
are
at
last
—
uncork
it
,
man
,
and
give
us
a
thimbleful
—
blob
!
<EOS>
there
goes
the
stopper
—
here
's
a
glass"—smacking
<EOS>
his
lips—"whist
<EOS>
,
Tim
,
another
drop
—
stuff
like
this
will
never
hurt
a
body
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Coates
,
try
it
—
no
<EOS>
—
I
thought
you
'd
be
a
man
of
more
taste
.
<EOS>
""I
must
limit
you
to
a
certain
quantity
,
"
replied
Coates
,
"
or
you
will
not
be
fit
to
keep
guard
—
another
glass
must
be
the
extent
of
your
allowance
.
<EOS>
""Another
glass
!
<EOS>
and
do
you
think
I
'll
submit
to
any
such
iniquitous
proposition?""Beg
pardon
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Tim
,
"
but
her
ladyship
desires
me
to
tell
you
both
,
that
she
trusts
you
will
keep
the
strictest
watch
upon
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
same
message
also
from
Sir
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
you
hear
that
?
"
said
Coates
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
what
are
they
all
about
now
,
Tim
?
<EOS>
"
groaned
Titus
.
<EOS>
"Just
<EOS>
starting
,
sir
,
"
returned
Tim
;
"
and
,
indeed
,
<EOS>
I
must
not
lose
my
time
gossiping
here
,
for
I
be
wanted
below
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
pleased
to
take
care
of
yourselves
,
gentlemen
,
for
an
hour
or
so
,
for
there
will
be
only
a
few
women
-
kind
left
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
storm
's
just
over
,
and
the
men
are
all
lighting
their
torches
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
it
's
a
grand
sight
!
"
<EOS>
And
off
set
Tim
.
<EOS>
"Bad
luck
to
myself
,
anyhow
,
"
ejaculated
Titus
;
"
this
is
more
than
I
can
bear
—
I've
had
enough
of
this
watch
and
ward
business
—
if
the
prisoner
stirs
,
shoot
him
,
if
you
think
proper
—
I'll
be
back
in
an
hour
.
<EOS>
""I
tell
you
what
,
Mr.
Tyrconnel
,
"
said
Coates
,
coolly
taking
up
the
pistol
from
the
table
,
"
I
'm
a
man
of
few
words
,
but
those
few
are
,
I
hope
,
to
the
purpose
,
and
I
'd
have
you
to
know
<EOS>
if
you
stir
from
that
chair
,
or
attempt
to
leave
the
room
,
damme
<EOS>
but
I
'll
send
a
brace
of
bullets
after
you
.
<EOS>
I
'm
serious
,
I
assure
you
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
cocked
the
pistol
.
<EOS>
By
way
of
reply
to
this
menace
,
Titus
deliberately
filled
a
stiff
glass
of
whisky
-
and
-
water
.
<EOS>
"That
's
your
last
glass
,
"
said
the
inexorable
Coates
.
<EOS>
To
return
once
more
to
Luke
.
<EOS>
He
slept
uneasily
for
some
short
space
,
and
was
awakened
by
a
sound
which
reached
his
dreaming
ears
and
connected
itself
with
the
visions
that
slumber
was
weaving
around
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
some
moments
before
he
could
distinctly
remember
where
he
was
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
venture
to
sleep
again
,
though
he
felt
overwhelmed
by
drowsiness
—
there
was
a
fixed
pain
at
his
heart
,
as
if
circulation
were
suspended
.
<EOS>
Changing
his
posture
,
he
raised
himself
upon
one
arm
;
he
then
became
aware
of
a
scratching
noise
,
somewhat
similar
to
the
sound
he
had
heard
in
his
dream
,
and
perceived
a
light
gleaming
through
a
crevice
in
the
oaken
partition
.
<EOS>
His
attention
was
immediately
arrested
,
and
placing
his
eye
close
to
the
chink
,
he
distinctly
saw
a
dark
lantern
burning
,
and
by
its
light
a
man
filing
some
implement
of
housebreaking
.
<EOS>
The
light
fell
before
the
hard
features
of
the
man
,
with
whose
countenance
Luke
was
familiar
;
and
although
only
one
person
came
within
the
scope
of
his
view
,
Luke
could
make
out
,
from
a
muttered
conversation
that
was
carried
on
,
that
he
had
a
companion
.
<EOS>
The
parties
were
near
to
him
,
and
though
speaking
in
a
low
tone
,
Luke
's
quick
ear
caught
the
following:"What
keeps
Jack
Palmer
,
I
wonder
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
of
the
file
.
<EOS>
"
We
're
all
ready
for
the
fakement
—
pops
primed
—
and
I
tell
you
what
,
<EOS>
Rob
Rust
,
I
've
made
my
clasp
-
knife
as
sharp
as
a
razor
,
and
damme
,
if
Lady
Rookwood
offers
any
resistance
,
I
'll
spoil
her
talking
in
future
<EOS>
,
I
promise
you
.
"Suppressed
<EOS>
laughter
from
Rust
followed
this
speech
.
<EOS>
That
laugh
made
Luke
's
blood
run
cold
within
his
veins
.
<EOS>
"Harkee
<EOS>
,
Dick
Wilder
,
you
're
a
reg'lar
out
-
and
-
outer
,
and
stops
at
nothing
,
and
curse
me
if
I
'd
think
any
more
of
it
than
yourself
.
<EOS>
But
Jack
's
as
squeamish
of
bloodshed
as
young
Miss
that
cries
at
her
cut
finger
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
safer
plan
.
<EOS>
Say
what
you
will
,
nothing
but
<EOS>
that
will
stop
a
woman
's
tongue
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
make
short
work
with
her
ladyship
to
-
night
,
anyhow
.
<EOS>
Hist
!
<EOS>
here
Jack
comes
.
<EOS>
"A
footstep
crossed
in
the
room
,
and
,
presently
afterwards
,
exclamations
of
surprise
and
smothered
laughter
were
heard
from
the
parties
.
<EOS>
"Bravo
<EOS>
,
Jack
!
<EOS>
famous
!
<EOS>
that
disguise
would
deceive
the
devil
himself
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
now
,
my
lads
,
"
said
the
newcomer
,
"
is
all
right?""Right
and
tight
.
<EOS>
""Nothing
forgotten?""Nothing
.
<EOS>
""Then
off
with
your
stamps
,
and
on
with
your
list
slippers
;
not
a
word

<EOS>
Follow
me
,
and
,
for
your
lives
,
do
n't
move
a
step
<EOS>

as
I
direct
you
.
<EOS>
The
word
must
be
,
'
Sir
Piers
Rookwood

'
<EOS>
We
'll
overhaul
the
swag
here
.
<EOS>
This
crack
may
make
us
all
for
life
;
and
if
you
'll
follow
my
directions
implicitly
,
we
'll
do
the
trick
in
style
.
<EOS>
This
slum
must
be
our
rendezvous
when
all
's
over
;
for
hark
ye
,
my
lads
,
I
'll
not
budge
an
inch
till
Luke
Bradley
be
set
free
.
<EOS>
He
's
an
old
friend
,
and
I
always
stick
by
old
friends
.
<EOS>
I
'd
do
the
same
for
one
of
you
if
you
were
in
the
same
scrape
,
so
,
damn
you
,
no
flinching
;
besides
,
I
owe
that
spider
-
shanked
,
snivelling
split
-
cause
Coates
,
who
stands
sentry
,
a
grudge
,
and
I
'll
pay
him
off
,
as
Paul
did
the
Ephesians
.
<EOS>
You
may
crop
his
ears
,
or
slit
his
tongue
as
you
would
a
magpie
's
,
or
any
other
chattering
varmint
;
make
him
sign
his
own
testament
,
or
treat
him
with
a
touch
of
your
Habeas
Corpus
Act
,
if
you
think
proper
,
or
give
him
a
taste
of
blue
plumb
.
<EOS>
One
thing
only
I
stipulate
,
that
you
do
n't
hurt
that
fat
,
mutton
-
headed
Broganeer
,
whatever
he
may
say
or
do
;
he
's
a
devilish
good
fellow
.
<EOS>
And
now
to
business
.
<EOS>
"Saying
<EOS>
which
,
they
noiselessly
departed
.
<EOS>
But
carefully
as
the
door
was
closed
,
Luke
's
ear
could
detect
the
sound
.
<EOS>
His
blood
boiled
with
indignation
;
and
he
experienced
what
all
must
have
felt
who
have
been
similarly
situated
,
with
the
will
,
but
not
the
power
,
to
assist
another
—
a
sensation
almost
approaching
to
torture
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
distant
scream
burst
upon
his
ears
—
another
—
he
hesitated
no
longer
.
<EOS>
With
all
his
force
he
thundered
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
do
you
want
,
rascal
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Coates
,
from
without
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
are
robbers
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
""Thank
you
for
the
information
.
<EOS>
There
is
one
I
know
of
already
.
<EOS>
""Fool
,
they
are
in
Lady
Rookwood
's
room
.
<EOS>
Run
to
her
assistance
.
<EOS>
""A

leave
you

<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
you
hear
that
scream?""Eh
,
what
—
what
's
that
?
<EOS>
I
do
hear
something
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
Luke
dashed
with
all
his
force
against
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
yielded
to
the
blow
,
and
he
stood
before
the
astonished
attorney
.
"Advance
<EOS>
a
footstep
,
villain
,
"
exclaimed
Coates
,
presenting
both
his
pistols
,
"
and
I
lodge
a
brace
of
balls
in
your
head
.
<EOS>
""Listen
<EOS>
to
me
,
"
said
Luke
;
"
the
robbers
are
in
Lady
Rookwood
's
chamber
—
they
will
plunder
the
place
of
everything
—
perhaps
murder
her
.
<EOS>
Fly
to
her
assistance

I
will
accompany
you

it
is
your
only
chance

<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
only
chance

<EOS>
your
only
chance

<EOS>
Do
you
take
me
for
a
greenhorn
?
<EOS>
This
is
a
poor
subterfuge
;
could
you
not
have
vamped
up
something
better
?
<EOS>
Get
back
to
your
own
room
,
or
I
shall
make
no
more
of
shooting
you
than
I
would
of
snuffing
that
candle
.
<EOS>
""Be
advised
,
sir
,
"
continued
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
three
of
them
—
give
me
a
pistol
,
and
fear
nothing
.
<EOS>
""Give
you
<EOS>
a
pistol

<EOS>
Ha

be
its

<EOS>
You
are

I
will
say

<EOS>
""Sir

you

<EOS>
Is
life
nothing

Rookwood
may
be
murdered

<EOS>
""I
tell
you
,
once
for
all
,
it

n't

<EOS>
Go
back
to
your
room
,
or
take
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
""By
the
powers
!
<EOS>
but
it
shall
do
,
anyhow
,
"
exclaimed
Titus
,
flinging
himself
upon
the
attorney
,
and
holding
both
his
arms
;
"
you
've
bullied
me
long
enough
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
the
lad
's
in
the
right
.
<EOS>
"Luke
snatched
the
pistols
from
the
hands
of
Coates
.
<EOS>
"Very
<EOS>
well
,
Mr.
Tyrconnel
;
very
well
,
sir
,
"
cried
the
attorney
,
boiling
with
wrath
,
and
spluttering
out
his
words
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Extremely
well
,
sir
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
perhaps
aware
,
sir
,
what
you
have
done
;
but
you
will
repent
this
,
sir
—
repent
<EOS>
,
I
say
—
repent
was
my
word
,
Mr.
Tyrconnel
.
<EOS>
""Poh!—poh

"
replied
Titus
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
repent
a
good

natured
action
.
<EOS>
""Follow
<EOS>
me
,
"
cried
Luke
;
"
<EOS>
settle
your
disputes
hereafter
.
<EOS>
Quick
,
or
we
shall
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
"Coates
<EOS>
bustled
after
him
,
and
Titus
,
putting
the
neck
of
the
forbidden
whisky
bottle
to
his
lips
,
and
gulping
down
a
hasty
mouthful
,
snatched
up
a
rusty
poker
,
and
followed
the
party
with
more
alacrity
than
might
have
been
expected
from
so
portly
a

,
that
ever
travelled
the
road
.
<EOS>
Beaux
Stratagem
.
<EOS>
ACCOMPANIED
by
her
son
,
Lady
Rookwood
,
on
quitting
the
chamber
of
the
dead
,
returned
to
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
She
then
renewed
all
her
arguments
;
had
recourse
to
passionate
supplications
—
to
violent
threats
,
but
without
effect
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
maintained
profound
silence
.
<EOS>
Passion
,
as
it
ever
doth
,
defeated
its
own
ends
;
and
Lady
Rookwood
,
seeing
the
ill
effect
her
anger
would
probably
produce
,
gradually
softened
the
asperity
of
her
manner
,
and
suffered
him
to
depart
.
<EOS>
Left
to
herself
,
and
to
the
communings
of
her
own
troubled
spirit
,
her
fortitude
,
in
a
measure
,
forsook
her
,
under
the
pressure
of
the
difficulties
by
which
she
was
environed
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
plan
she
could
devise
—
no
scheme
adopt
,
unattended
with
peril
.
<EOS>
She
must
act
alone
—
with
promptitude
and
secrecy
.
<EOS>
To
win
her
son
over
was
her
chief
desire
,
and
that
,
at
all
hazards
,
she
was
resolved
to
do
.
<EOS>
But
how
?
<EOS>
She
knew
of
only
one
point
on
which
he
was
vulnerable
—
his
love
for
Eleanor
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
By
raising
doubts
in
his
mind
,
and
placing
fresh
difficulties
in
his
path
,
she
might
compel
him
to
acquiesce
in
her
machinations
,
as
a
necessary
means
of
accomplishing
his
own
object
.
<EOS>
This
she
hoped
to
effect
.
<EOS>
Still
there
was
a
depth
of
resolution
in
the
placid
stream
of
Ranulph
's
character
which
she
had
often
noticed
with
apprehension
.
<EOS>
Aware
of
his
firmness
,
she
dreaded
lest
his
sense
of
justice
should
be
stronger
than
his
passion
.
<EOS>
As
she
wove
these
webs
of
darkness
,
fear
,
hitherto
unknown
,
took
possession
of
her
soul
.
<EOS>
She
listened
to
the
howling
of
the
wind
—
to
the
vibration
of
the
rafters
—
to
the
thunder
's
roar
,
and
to
the
hissing
rain
—
till
she
,
who
never
trembled
at
the
thought
of
danger
,
became
filled
with
vague
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
Lights
were
ordered
;
and
when
her
old
attendant
returned
.
<EOS>
Lady
Rookwood
fixed
a
look
so
wistful
upon
her
,
that
Agnes
ventured
to
address
her
.
<EOS>
"Bless
<EOS>
you
,
my
lady
,
"
said
the
ancient
handmaiden
,
trembling
<EOS>
,
"
you
look
very
pale
,
and
no
wonder
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sick
at
heart
,
too
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
shall
be
glad
when
they
return
from
the
church
,
and
happier
still
when
the
morning
dawns
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
sleep
a
wink
—
can't
close
my
eyes
,
but
I
think
of
him
.
<EOS>
""Of
him?""Of
Sir
Piers
,
my
lady
;
for
though
he
's
dead
,
I
do
n't
think
he
's
gone
.
<EOS>
""How?""Why
,
my
lady
,
the
corruptible
part
of
him
's
gone
,
sure
enough
.
<EOS>
But
the
incorruptible
,
as
Dr.
Small
calls
it
—
the
sperrit
,
my
lady
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
my
fancy
,
your
ladyship
;
but
as
I
'm
standing
here
,
when
I
went
back
into
the
room
just
now
for
the
lights
,
as
I
hope
to
live
,
I
thought
I
saw
Sir
Piers
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
""You
are
crazed
,
Agnes
.
<EOS>
""No
,
my
lady
,
I
'm
not
crazed
;
it
was
mere
fancy
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
it
's
a
blessed
thing
to
live
with
an
easy
conscience
—
a
thrice
blessed
thing
to
die
with
an
easy
one
,
and
that
's
what
I
never
shall
,
I
'm
afeard
.
<EOS>
Poor
Sir
Piers
!
<EOS>
I
'd
mumble
a
prayer
for
him
,
if
I
durst
.
<EOS>
""Leave
<EOS>
me
,
"
said
Lady
Rookwood
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
And
Agnes
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
if
the
dead
can
return
?
"
thought
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"
All
men
doubt
it
,
yet
all
men
believe
it
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
believe
it
,
were
there
not
a
creeping
horror
that
overmasters
me
,
when
I
think
of
the
state
beyond
the
grave
—
that
intermediate
state
,
for
such
it
must
be
,
when
the
body
lieth
mouldering
in
the
ground
,
and
the
soul
survives
,
to
wander
,
unconfined
,
until
the
hour
of
doom
.
<EOS>
And
doth
the
soul
survive
when
disenthralled
?
<EOS>
Is
it
dependent
on
the
body
?
<EOS>
Does
it
perish
with
the
body
?
<EOS>
These
are
doubts
I
can
not
resolve
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
deemed
there
was
no
future
state
,
this
hand
should
at
once
liberate
me
from
my
own
weaknesses
—
my
fears
—
my
life
.
<EOS>
There
is
but
one
path
to
acquire
that
knowledge
,
which
,
once
taken
,
can
never
be
retraced
.
<EOS>
I
am
content
to
live
—
while
living
,
to
be
feared
—
it
may
be
,
hated
;
when
dead
,
to
be
contemned
—
yet
still
remembered
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
what
sound
was
that
?
<EOS>
A
stifled
scream
!
<EOS>
Agnes!—without
there
!
<EOS>
She
is
full
of
fears
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
free
from
them
myself
,
but
I
will
shake
them
off
.
<EOS>
This
will
divert
their
channel
,
"
continued
she
,
drawing
from
her
bosom
the
marriage
certificate
.
<EOS>
"
This
will
arouse
the
torpid
current
of
my
blood—'Piers
Rookwood
to
Susan
Bradley
.
'
<EOS>
And
by
whom
was
it
solemnized
?
<EOS>
The
name
is
Checkley
—
Richard
Checkley
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
I
bethink
me
—
a
Papist
priest
—
a
recusant
—
who
was
for
some
time
an
inmate
of
the
hall
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
of
this
man
—
he
was
afterwards
imprisoned
,
but
escaped
—
he
is
either
dead
or
in
a
foreign
land
.
<EOS>
No
witnesses—'tis
well
!
<EOS>
Methinks
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
Rookwood
did
well
to
preserve
this
.
<EOS>
It
shall
light
his
funeral
pyre
.
<EOS>
Would
he
could
now
behold
me
,
as
I
consume
it!"She
held
the
paper
in
the
direction
of
the
candle
;
but
,
ere
it
could
touch
the
flame
,
it
dropped
from
her
hand
.
<EOS>
As
if
her
horrible
wish
had
been
granted
,
before
her
stood
the
figure
of
her
husband
!
<EOS>
Lady
Rookwood
started
not
.
<EOS>
No
sign
of
trepidation
or
alarm
,
save
the
sudden
stiffening
of
her
form
,
was
betrayed
.
<EOS>
Her
bosom
ceased
to
palpitate
—
her
respiration
stopped
—
<EOS>
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
apparition
.
<EOS>
The
figure
appeared
to
regard
her
sternly
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
some
little
distance
,
within
the
shade
cast
by
the
lofty
bedstead
.
<EOS>
Still
she
could
distinctly
discern
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
ocular
deception
;
it
was
attired
in
the
costume
Sir
Piers
was
wo
nt
to
wear
—
a
hunting
dress
.
<EOS>
All
that
her
son
had
told
her
rushed
to
her
recollection
.
<EOS>
The
phantom
advanced
.
<EOS>
Its
countenance
was
pale
,
and
wore
a
gloomy
frown
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
would
you
destroy
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
apparition
,
in
a
hollow
tone
.
<EOS>
"The
evidence
<EOS>
of——""What?""Your
marriage
.
<EOS>
""With
<EOS>
yourself
,
accursed
woman?""With
Susan
Bradley
.
<EOS>
""What
's
that
I
hear
?
<EOS>
"
shouted
the
figure
,
in
an
altered
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Married
to
her
!
<EOS>
then
Luke
is
legitimate
,
and
heir
to
this
estate
!
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
apparition
rushed
to
the
table
,
and
laid
a
very
substantial
grasp
upon
the
document
.
"
<EOS>
A
marriage
certificate
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
spectre
;
"
here
's
a
piece
of
luck
!
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
often
in
our
lottery
life
we
draw
a
prize
like
this
.
<EOS>
One
way
or
the
other
,
it
must
turn
up
a
few
cool
thousands
.
<EOS>
""Restore
<EOS>
that
paper
,
villain
,
"
exclaimed
Lady
Rookwood
,
recovering
all
the
audacity
natural
to
her
character
the
instant
she
discovered
the
earthly
nature
of
the
intruder—"restore
it
,
or
,
by
Heaven
,
you
shall
rue
your
temerity
.
<EOS>
""Softly
,
softly
,
"
replied
the
pseudo
-
phantom
,
with
one
hand
pushing
back
the
lady
,
while
the
other
conveyed
the
precious
document
to
the
custody
of
his
nether
man—"softly
,
"
said
he
,
giving
the
buckskin
pocket
a
slap—"two
words
to
that
,
my
lady
.
<EOS>
I
know
its
value
as
well
as
yourself
,
and
must
make
my
market
.
<EOS>
The
highest
offer
has
me
,
your
ladyship
;
he
's
but
<EOS>
a
poor
auctioneer
that
knocks
down
his
ware
when
only
one
bidder
is
present
.
<EOS>
Luke
Bradley
,
or
,
as
I
find
he
now
is
,
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
,
may
come
down
more
handsomely
.
<EOS>
""Who
<EOS>
are
you
,
ruffian
,
and
to
what
end
is
this
masquerade
assumed
?
<EOS>
If
for
the
purpose
of
terrifying
me
into
compliance
with
the
schemes
of
that
madman
,
Luke
Bradley
,
whom
I
presume
to
be
your
confederate
,
your
labor
is
misspent
—
your
stolen
disguise
has
no
more
weight
with
me
than
his
forged
claims
.
<EOS>
""Forged
claims
!
<EOS>
Egad
,
he
must
be
a
clever
hand
to
have
forged
that
certificate
.
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
,
however
,
is
in
error
.
<EOS>
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
is
no
associate
of
mine
;
I
am
his
late
father
's
friend
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
no
time
to
bandy
talk
.
<EOS>
What
money
have
you
in
the
house
?
<EOS>
Be
alive
.
<EOS>
""You
are
a
robber
,
then?""Not
I.
I
'm
a
tax

gatherer

a
collector
of
Rich

Rates

ha

<EOS>
What
plate
have
you
got
?
<EOS>
Nay
,
do
n't
be
alarmed
—
take
it
quietly
—
these
things
ca
n't
be
helped
—
better
make
up
your
mind
to
do
it
without
more
ado
—
much
the
best
plan
—
no
screaming
,
it
may
injure
your
lungs
,
and
can
alarm
nobody
.
<EOS>
Your
maids
have
done
as
much
before
—
it
's
beneath
your
dignity
to
make
so
much
noise
.
<EOS>
So
,
you
will
not
heed
me
?
<EOS>
As
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
Saying
which
,
he
deliberately
cut
the
bell
-
cord
,
and
drew
out
a
brace
of
pistols
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
"Agnes
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
shrieked
Lady
Rookwood
,
now
seriously
alarmed
.
<EOS>
"I
must
caution
your
ladyship
to
be
silent
,
"
said
the
robber
,
who
,
as
our
readers
will
no
doubt
have
already
conjectured
,
was
no
other
than
the
redoubted
Jack
Palmer
.
<EOS>
"
Agnes
is
already
disposed
of
,
"
said
he
,
cocking
a
pistol
.
"
<EOS>
However
like
your
deceased
'
lord
and
master
'
<EOS>
I
may
appear
,
you
will
find
you
have
got
a
very
different
spirit
from
that
of
Sir
Piers
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
I
am
naturally
the
politest
man
breathing
—
have
been
accounted
the
best
-
bred
man
on
the
road
by
every
lady
whom
I
have
had
the
honor
of
addressing
;
and
I
should
be
sorry
to
sully
my
well
-
earned
reputation
by
anything
like
rudeness
.
<EOS>
I
must
use
a
little
force
,
of
the
gentlest
kind
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
will
permit
me
to
hand
you
to
a
chair
.
<EOS>
Bless
me
!
<EOS>
what
a
wrist
your
ladyship
has
got
.
<EOS>
Excuse
me
if
I
hurt
you
,
but
you
are
so
devilish
strong
.
<EOS>
What
ho
!
'
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
Rookwood
calls—'""Ready
,
"
cried
a
voice
.
<EOS>
"That
's
the
word
,
"
rejoined
another
;
"
ready
;
"
and
immediately
two
men
,
their
features
entirely
hidden
by
a
shroud
of
black
crape
,
accoutred
in
rough
attire
,
and
each
armed
with
pistols
,
rushed
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
"Lend
<EOS>
a
hand
,
"
said
Jack
.
<EOS>
Even
in
this
perilous
extremity
Lady
Rookwood
's
courage
did
not
desert
her
.
<EOS>
Anticipating
their
purpose
,
ere
her
assailants
could
reach
her
<EOS>
she
extricated
herself
from
Palmer
's
grasp
,
and
rushed
upon
the
foremost
so
unexpectedly
,
that
,
before
the
man
could
seize
her
,
she
snatched
a
pistol
from
his
hand
,
and
presented
it
at
the
group
with
an
aspect
like
that
of
a
tigress
at
bay
—
her
eye
wandering
from
one
to
the
other
,
as
if
selecting
a
mark
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
of
a
few
seconds
,
in
which
the
men
glanced
at
the
lady
,
and
then
at
their
leader
.
<EOS>
Jack
looked
blank
.
"Hem
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
coolly
;
"
this
is
something
new
—
disarmed
—
defied
by
a
petticoat
.
<EOS>
Hark
ye
,
Rob
Rust
,
the
disgrace
rests
with
you
.
<EOS>
Clear
your
character
,
by
securing
her
at
once
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
afraid
of
a
woman?""A
woman
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Rust
,
in
a
surly
tone
;
"
devilish
like
a
woman
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Few
men
could
do
what
she
has
done
.
<EOS>
Give
the
word
,
and
I
fire
.
<EOS>
As
to
seizing
her
,
that
's
more
than
I
'll
engage
to
do
.
<EOS>
""You
are
a
coward
,
"
cried
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
steer
clear
of
blood
—
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
Come
,
madam
,
surrender
,
like
the
more
sensible
part
of
your
sex
,
at
discretion
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
resistance
of
no
avail
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
stepped
boldly
towards
her
.
<EOS>
Lady
Rookwood
pulled
the
trigger
.
<EOS>
The
pistol
flashed
in
the
pan
.
<EOS>
She
flung
away
the
useless
weapon
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
"Ha
,
ha
!
"
said
Jack
,
as
he
leisurely
stooped
to
pick
up
the
pistol
,
and
approached
her
ladyship
;
"
the
bullet
is
not
yet
cast
that
is
to
be
my
billet
.
<EOS>
Here
,
"
said
he
,
dealing
Rust
a
heavy
thump
upon
the
shoulder
with
the
butt
-
end
of
the
piece
,
"
take
back
your
snapper
,
and
look
you
prick
the
touchhole
,
or
your
barking
-
iron
will
never
bite
for
you
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
madam
,
I
must
take
the
liberty
of
again
handing
you
to
a
seat
.
<EOS>
Dick
Wilder
,
the
cord
—
quick
.
<EOS>
It
distresses
me
to
proceed
to
such
lengths
with
your
ladyship
—
but
safe
bind
,
safe
find
,
as
Mr.
Coates
would
say
.
<EOS>
""You
will
not
bind
me
,
ruffian
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
ladyship
is
very
much
mistaken
—
I
have
no
alternative
—
your
ladyship
's
wrist
is
far
too
dexterous
to
be
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
I
must
furthermore
request
of
your
ladyship
to
be
less
vociferous
—
you
interrupt
business
,
which
should
be
transacted
with
silence
and
deliberation
.
<EOS>
"Lady
Rookwood
's
rage
and
vexation
at
this
indignity
were
beyond
all
bounds
.
<EOS>
Resistance
,
however
,
was
useless
,
and
she
submitted
in
silence
.
<EOS>
The
cord
was
passed
tightly
round
her
arms
,
when
it
flashed
upon
her
recollection
for
the
first
time
that
Coates
and
Tyrconnel
,
who
were
in
charge
of
her
captive
in
the
lower
corridor
,
might
be
summoned
to
her
assistance
.
<EOS>
This
idea
no
sooner
crossed
her
mind
than
she
uttered
a
loud
and
prolonged
scream
.
<EOS>
"'Sdeath
!
"
cried
Jack
;
"
civility
is
wasted
here
.
<EOS>
Give
me
the
gag
,
Rob
.
<EOS>
""Better
<EOS>
slit
her
squeaking
-
pipe
at
once
,
"
replied
Rust
,
drawing
his
clasped
knife
;
"
she
'll
thwart
everything
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
gag
,
I
say
,
not
that
.
<EOS>
""I
ca
n't
find
the
gag
,
"
exclaimed
Wilder
,
savagely
.
"
<EOS>
Leave
Rob
Rust
to
manage
her
<EOS>
—
he'll
silence
her
,
I
warrant
you
,
while
you
and
I
rummage
the
room
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
leave
her
to
me
,
"
said
the
other
miscreant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Go
about
your
business
,
and
take
no
heed
.
<EOS>
Her
hands
are
fast
—
she
ca
n't
scratch
.
<EOS>
I
'll
do
it
with
a
single
gash
—
send
her
to
join
her
lord
,
whom
she
loved
so
well
,
before
he
's
under
ground
.
<EOS>
They
'll
have
something
to
see
when
they
come
home
from
the
master
's
funeral
—
their
mistress
cut
and
dry
for
another
.
<EOS>
Ho
,
ho!""Mercy
,
mercy
!
"
shrieked
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
ay
,
I
'll
be
merciful
,
"
said
Rust
,
brandishing
his
knife
before
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
be
long
about
it
.
<EOS>
Leave
her
to
me
—
I'll
give
her
a
taste
of
Sir
Sydney
.
<EOS>
""No
,
no
,
<EOS>
Rust
;
no
bloodshed
,
"
said
Jack
,
authoritatively
;
"
I
'll
find
some
other
way
to
gag
the
jade
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
a
noise
of
rapid
footsteps
was
heard
within
the
passage
.
<EOS>
"Assistance
comes
,
"
screamed
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"
Help
!
<EOS>
help!""To
<EOS>
the
door
!
"
cried
Jack
.
<EOS>
The
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
before
Luke
dashed
into
the
room
,
followed
by
Coates
and
Tyrconnel
.
<EOS>
Palmer
and
his
companions
levelled
their
pistols
at
the
intruders
,
and
the
latter
would
have
fired
,
but
Jack
's
keen
eye
having
discerned
Luke
amongst
the
foremost
,
checked
further
hostilities
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
Lady
Rookwood
,
meanwhile
,
finding
herself
free
from
restraint
,
rushed
towards
her
deliverers
,
and
crouched
beneath
Luke
's
protecting
arms
,
which
were
extended
,
pistol
in
hand
,
over
her
head
.
<EOS>
Behind
them
stood
Titus
Tyrconnel
,
flourishing
the
poker
,
and
Mr.
Coates
,
who
,
upon
the
sight
of
so
much
warlike
preparation
,
began
somewhat
to
repent
having
rushed
so
precipitately
into
the
lion
's
den
.
<EOS>
"Luke
Bradley
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Palmer
,
stepping
forward
.
<EOS>
"Luke
Bradley
!
"
echoed
Lady
Rookwood
,
recoiling
and
staring
into
his
face
.
<EOS>
"Fear
<EOS>
nothing
,
madam
,
"
cried
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
here
to
assist
you
—
I
will
defend
you
with
my
life
.
<EOS>
""You
defend
me
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Lady
Rookwood
,
doubtfully
.
<EOS>
"Even
<EOS>
I
,
"
cried
Luke
,
"
strange
as
it
may
sound
.
<EOS>
""Holy
<EOS>
powers
protect
me
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Titus
.
<EOS>
"
As
I
live
,
it
is
Sir
Piers
himself
.
<EOS>
""Sir
Piers
!
"
echoed
Coates
,
catching
the
infection
of
terror
,
as
he
perceived
Palmer
more
distinctly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
is
the
dead
come
to
life
again
?
<EOS>
A
ghost
,
a
ghost!""By
my
soul
,
"
cried
Titus
,
"
it
's
the
first
ghost
I
ever
heard
of
that
committed
a
burglary
in
its
own
house
,
and
on
the
night
of
the
body
's
burial
,
too
.
<EOS>
But
who
the
devil
are
these
?
<EOS>
maybe
they
're
ghosts
likewise
.
<EOS>
""They
are
,
"
said
Palmer
,
in
a
hollow
tone
,
mimicking
the
voice
of
Sir
Piers
,
"
attendant
spirits
.
<EOS>
We
are
come
for
this
woman
;
her
time
is
out
;
so
no
more
palavering
,
Titus
.
<EOS>
Lend
a
hand
to
take
her
to
the
churchyard
,
and
be
hanged
to
you
.
<EOS>
""Upon
<EOS>
my
conscience
,
Mr.
Coates
,
"
cried
Titus
,
"
it
's
either
the
devil
,
or
Sir
Piers
.
<EOS>
We
'll
be
only
in
the
way
here
.
<EOS>
He
's
only
just
settling
his
old
scores
with
his
lady
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
would
come
to
this
long
ago
.
<EOS>
We
'd
best
beat
a
retreat
.
<EOS>
"Jack
took
advantage
of
the
momentary
confusion
created
by
this
incidental
alarm
at
his
disguise
to
direct
Rust
towards
the
door
by
which
the
new
comers
had
entered
;
and
,
this
being
accomplished
,
he
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
.
<EOS>
"What
!
<EOS>
not
know
me
?
"
<EOS>
cried
<EOS>
he—"not
know
your
old
friend
with
a
new
face
,
Luke
?
<EOS>
Nor
you

Titus
?
<EOS>
Nor

Coates

<EOS>
cried
Titus

<EOS>
"
Why

this
beats
Banaghan

Arrah

<EOS>
Jack

what
does
this

<EOS>
Is
it

<EOS>
You
're
not
robbing
in

<EOS>

I
am

exclaimed
Jack
;
"
and
it
is
my
own
self
you
see
.
<EOS>
I
just
took
the
liberty
of
borrowing
Sir
Piers
's
old
hunting
-
coat
from
the
justice
-
room
.
<EOS>
You
said
my
toggery
would
n't
do

<EOS>
I
'm
no
other
than

Jack

<EOS>
""With
<EOS>
half
a
dozen
aliases
at
your
back

,
I
dare
say
,

cried
Coates
.
<EOS>
"
I
suspected
you
all
along
.
<EOS>
All
your
praise
of
highwaymen
was
not
lost
upon
me

<EOS>
No
,
no

;
I
can
see
into

it
ever
so
thick

<EOS>
""Well

replied
Jack
,
"
I

Keep
quiet

you

<EOS>
As
to
you
,
Luke
Bradley
,
you
have
anticipated
my
intention
by
half
an
hour

I
meant
to
set
you
free

<EOS>
For
you

Mr.

trouble
yourself

added
he
,
levelling
a
pistol
at
the
attorney
,
who
,
however
,
shielded
himself
,
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
,
behind
Luke
's
person

"
<EOS>
Stand
aside
,
Luke
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
stir
not
,
"
replied
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
for
your
good
intention

will
not
injure
you
—
that
is
,
if
you
do
not
force
me
to
do
so

<EOS>
I
am
here
to
defend
her
ladyship

<EOS>
""What
's
that
you
say

"
<EOS>
returned
Jack
,
in
surprise—"defend
her
<EOS>
ladyship?""With
<EOS>
my

replied
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
counsel
you
to
depart

""Are

you
mad

your
enemy

would
hang
you

<EOS>
Tut

tut

<EOS>
Stand
aside

I
say
,
Luke
Bradley
,
or
look
to
yourself

<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
had
better
consider
well

you
proceed

"
said
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
me

<EOS>
I
have
taken
odds
as
great

not
come
off
the
vanquished

<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
odds
are
even

"
cried
Titus
,
"
if
Mr.
Coates
will
but
show
fight

<EOS>
I
'll
stand
by
you
to
the
last

You
're

Jack
Palmer

you
resemble
Dick
Turpin

""You
hear
this
?

cried
Luke
.
<EOS>
"Hot
-
headed
fool
!

<EOS>
muttered
Jack
.
"Why
<EOS>
do
n't
you
shoot
him
on
the
spot
?
"
said
Wilder
.
<EOS>
"And
mar
my
own
chance

"
thought
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
that
will
never
do
;
his
life
is
not

be
thrown
away

<EOS>
Be
quiet

said
he
,
in
a
whisper
to
Wilder
;
"
I
've
another
card
to
play
,
which
shall
serve
us
better
than
all
the
plunder
here
.
<EOS>
No
harm
must
come
to
that
youngster
;
his
life
is
worth
thousands
to
us
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
turning
to
Luke
,
he
continued
,
"
I
'm
loth
to
hurt
you
;
<EOS>
yet
what
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
You
must
have
the
worst
of
it
if
we
come
to
a
pitched
battle
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
advise
you
,
as
a
friend
,
to
draw
off
your
forces

<EOS>
We
are
three
to
three
,
it
is
true
;
but
two
of
your
party
are
unarmed

<EOS>
""Unarmed

interrupted
Titus
.
"
<EOS>
Devil
burn
me

<EOS>
this
iron
shillelah

convince
you

any

""Make
<EOS>
ready
then

my
lads

cried
Palmer
.
<EOS>
"Stop
<EOS>
a
minute
,
"
exclaimed
Coates
.
<EOS>
"
This
gets
serious
;
it
will
end
in
homicide
—
in
murder

<EOS>
We
shall
all
have
our
throats
cut
to
a
certainty
;
and
though
these
rascals
will
as
certainly
be
hanged
for
it

that
will
be
poor
satisfaction
to
the
sufferers

<EOS>
Had
we
not
better
refer
the
matter
to
arbitration?""I'm
for
fighting
it
out

said
Titus
,
whisking
the
poker
round
his
head
like
a
flail
in
action
.
<EOS>
"
My
blood
's
up

Jack
Palmer

I
'm
for

""I

the
attorney

not
placed

impatiently

done

""You
<EOS>
mean
me
no

returned
Luke
.
<EOS>
Jack
made
no
answer
,
but
uncocking
his
pistols
,
deposited
them
within
his
pockets
.
<EOS>
"Shoot
<EOS>
him

he
advances

whispered
Coates
;
"
he
is
in
your
power

""Scoundrel

Luke

for
God
's

said
Coates

<EOS>
Lady
Rookwood
had
apparently
listened
to
this
singular
conference
with
sullen
composure
,
though
in
reality
she
was
racked
with
anxiety
as
to
its
results
;
and
,
now
apprehending
that
Palmer
was
about
to
make
an
immediate
disclosure
to
Luke
,
she
accosted
him
as
he
passed
her
.
<EOS>
"Unbind
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
she
,
"
and
what
you

be
yours

"Palmer
untied
the
cord

Lady
Rookwood
,
approaching
a
table
whereon
stood
the
escritoire
,
touched
a
spring
,
and
a
secret
drawer
flew
open
.
<EOS>
"You

this

asked
Luke

"
Speak

<EOS>
""I

returned
the
lady
,
hastily

<EOS>
Palmer
's
eyes
glistened
at
the
treasures
exposed
to
his
view

<EOS>
"They
are
jewels

""I

about
it

"
cried
Jack
,
throwing
the
casket
to
Wilder
,
and
seizing
Lady
Rookwood
's
hands
.
<EOS>
"
I
am

<EOS>
Luke
Bradley

I

<EOS>
""Would
you
betray

"
cried
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"You

<EOS>
Nay

Luke
,

off

<EOS>
See
,
Lady
Rookwood
,
how
you
would
treat
a

<EOS>
This
strange
fellow
would
blow
out
my
brains

laying
a
finger
upon
your
ladyship

<EOS>
""I
will
suffer
no

be
done

her

"
said
Luke
;
"
release
her

<EOS>
""Your

him

said
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you

Luke

shall
learn
the

set
upon
your

<EOS>
You
will
not

her

<EOS>
This

she
has
proposed

paid
for
your
assassination

""How
?
"
exclaimed
Luke
,
recoiling
.
<EOS>
"A
lie
,
as
black
as
hell
,
"
cried
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"A
truth

as
clear
as

retained
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
speedily
convince
you
of
the
fact

<EOS>
Then
,
turning
to
Lady
Rookwood
,
he
whispered
,
"
Shall
I
give
him
the
marriage
document?""Beware
!
"
said
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
I
avouch
the
truth
<EOS>
,
then?"She
was
silent
.
<EOS>
"I
am
answered

said
Luke
.
<EOS>
"Then

her
to

"
cried
Jack
.
<EOS>
"No

"
replied
Luke
;
"
she
is
still
a

I
will
not
abandon
her
to
ruffianly

<EOS>
Set
her
free

<EOS>
""You

Jack

<EOS>
"Hurrah

<EOS>
vociferated
Coates

Luke
,
in
a
tone
in
which
scorn
and
sorrow
were
blended
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
meet
again

<EOS>
""We

returned
she
;

<EOS>
A

""Upon

Jack

""Lady

said
Luke

as
he
departed
,
"
I

not

this

""Is

asked
Palmer

his

<EOS>
"All

<EOS>
""Then

cried
Lady

in

replied
Coates

it

the

""Ha

discharging

CHAPTER
I.
—
<EOS>
A
MORNING
RIDEI
had
a
sister
,
who
among
the
raceOf
gipsies
was
the
fairest
.
<EOS>
Fair
<EOS>
she
wasIn
gentle
blood
,
and

her
beauty.—Brome
.
<EOS>
ON
quitting
Lady
Rookwood
's
chamber
,
Luke
speeded
along
the
gloomy
corridor
,
descended
the
spiral
stairs
,
and
,
swiftly
traversing
sundry
other
dark
passages
,
issued
from
a
door
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Day
was
just
beginning
to
break
.
<EOS>
His
first
object
had
been
to
furnish
himself
with
means
to
expedite
his
flight
;
and
,
perceiving
no
one
in
the
yard
<EOS>
,
he
directed
his
hasty
steps
towards
the
stable
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
fortunately
unfastened
;
and
,
entering
,
he
found
a
strong
roan
horse
,
which
he
knew
,
from
description
,
had
been
his
father
's
favorite
hunter
,
and
to
the
use
of
which
he
now
considered
himself
fully
entitled
.
<EOS>
The
animal
roused
himself
as
he
approached
,
shook
his
glossy
coat
,
and
neighed
,
as
if
he
recognized
the
footsteps
and
voice
.
<EOS>
"Thou
art
mistaken
,
old
fellow
,
"
said
Luke
;
"
I
am
not
he
thou
thinkest
;
nevertheless
,
I
am
glad
thy
instinct
would
have
it
so
.
<EOS>
If
thou
bearest
my
father
's
son
as
thou
hast
borne
thy
old
master
,
o'er
many
a
field
for
many
a
day
,
he
need
not
fear
the
best
mounted
of
his
pursuers
.
<EOS>
Soho
!
<EOS>
come
hither
,
Rook
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
noble
steed
turned
at
the
call
.
<EOS>
Luke
hastily
saddled
him
,
vaulted
upon
his
back
,
and
,
disregarding
every
impediment
in
the
shape
of
fence
or
ditch
,
shaped
his
course
across
the
field
towards
the
sexton
's
cottage
,
which
he
reached
just
as
its
owner
was
in
the
act
of
unlocking
his
door
.
<EOS>
Peter
testified
his
delight
and
surprise
at
the
escape
of
his
grandson
,
by
a
greeting
of
chuckling
laughter
.
"How?—escaped
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
he
.
<EOS>
"
Who
has
delivered
you
from
the
hands
of
the
Moabites
?
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
But
why
do
I
ask
?
<EOS>
Who
could
it
have
been
but
<EOS>
Jack
Palmer?""My
own
hands
have
set
me
free
,
"
returned
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
indebted
to
no
man
for
liberty
;
still
less
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
tarry
here
;
each
moment
is
precious
.
<EOS>
I
came
to
request
you
to
accompany
me
to
the
gipsy
encampment
.
<EOS>
Will
you
go
,
or
not?""And
mount
behind
you
?
"
<EOS>
replied
Peter
;
"
I
like
not
the
manner
of
conveyance
.
<EOS>
""Farewell
,
then
.
"
And
Luke
turned
to
depart
.
<EOS>
"Stay
<EOS>
;
that
is
Sir
Piers
's
horse
,
old
Rook
.
<EOS>
I
care
not
if
I
do
ride
him
.
<EOS>
""Quick
<EOS>
,
then
;
mount
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
delay
you
a
moment
,
"
rejoined
the
sexton
,
opening
his
door
,
and
throwing
his
implements
into
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
"
Back
,
Mole
;
back
,
sir
,
"
cried
he
,
as
the
dog
rushed
out
to
greet
him
.
<EOS>
"
Bring
your
steed
nigh
this
stone
,
grandson
Luke
—
there
—
a
little
nearer
—
all
's
right
.
"
<EOS>
And
away
they
galloped
.
<EOS>
The
sexton
's
first
inquiries
were
directed
to
ascertain
how
Luke
had
accomplished
his
escape
;
and
,
having
satisfied
himself
in
this
particular
,
he
was
content
to
remain
silent
;
musing
,
it
might
be
,
on
the
incidents
detailed
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
road
Luke
chose
was
a
rough
,
unfrequented
lane
,
that
skirted
,
for
nearly
a
mile
,
the
moss
-
grown
palings
of
the
park
.
<EOS>
It
then
diverged
to
the
right
,
and
seemed
to
bear
towards
a
range
of
hills
rising
in
the
distance
.
<EOS>
High
hedges
impeded
the
view
on
either
hand
;
but
there
were
occasional
gaps
,
affording
glimpses
of
the
tract
of
country
through
which
he
was
riding
.
<EOS>
Meadows
were
seen
steaming
with
heavy
dews
,
intersected
by
a
deep
channelled
stream
,
whose
course
was
marked
by
a
hanging
cloud
of
vapor
,
as
well
as
by
a
row
of
melancholy
pollard
-
willows
,
that
stood
like
stripped
,
shivering
urchins
by
the
river
side
.
<EOS>
Other
fields
succeeded
,
yellow
with
golden
grain
,
or
bright
with
flowering
clover
—
the
autumnal
crop
—
colored
with
every
shade
,
from
the
light
green
of
the
turnip
to
the
darker
verdure
of
the
bean
,
the
various
products
of
the
teeming
land
.
<EOS>
The
whole
was
backed
by
round
drowsy
masses
of
trees
.
<EOS>
Luke
spoke
not
,
nor
abated
his
furious
course
,
till
the
road
began
to
climb
a
steep
ascent
.
<EOS>
He
then
drew
in
the
rein
,
and
from
the
heights
of
the
acclivity
surveyed
the
plain
over
which
he
had
passed
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
rich
agricultural
district
,
with
little
picturesque
beauty
,
but
much
of
true
English
endearing
loveliness
to
recommend
it
.
<EOS>
Such
a
quiet
,
pleasing
landscape
,
in
short
,
as
one
views
,
at
such
a
season
of
the
year
,
from
every
eminence
in
every
county
of
our
merry
isle
.
<EOS>
The
picture
was
made
up
of
a
tract
of
land
filled
with
corn
ripe
for
the
sickle
,
or
studded
with
sheaves
of
the
same
golden
produce
,
enlivened
with
green
meadows
,
so
deeply
luxuriant
as
to
claim
the
scythe
for
the
second
time
;
each
divided
from
the
other
by
thick
hedgerows
,
the
uniformity
of
which
was
broken
ever
and
anon
by
some
towering
elm
,
tall
poplar
,
or
wide
-
branching
oak
.
<EOS>
Many
old
farmhouses
,
with
their
broad
barns
and
crowded
haystacks
—
forming
little
villages
in
themselves
—
ornamented
the
landscape
at
different
points
,
and
by
their
substantial
look
evidenced
the
fertility
of
the
soil
,
and
the
thriving
condition
of
its
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
Some
three
miles
distant
might
be
seen
the
scattered
hamlet
of
Rookwood
;
the
dark
russet
thatch
of
its
houses
scarcely
perceptible
amidst
the
embrowned
foliage
of
the
surrounding
timber
.
<EOS>
The
site
of
the
village
was
,
however
,
pointed
out
by
the
square
tower
of
the
antique
church
,
that
crested
the
summit
of
the
adjoining
hill
;
and
although
the
hall
was
entirely
hidden
from
view
,
Luke
readily
traced
out
its
locality
amidst
the
depths
of
the
dark
grove
in
which
it
was
embosomed
.
<EOS>
This
goodly
prospect
had
other
claims
to
attention
in
Luke
's
eyes
besides
its
agricultural
or
pictorial
merit
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
or
he
deemed
it
was
,
his
own
.
<EOS>
Far
as
his
eye
ranged
,
yea
,
even
beyond
the
line
of
vision
,
the
estates
of
Rookwood
extended
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
see
that
house
below
us
in
the
valley
?
"
asked
Peter
of
his
companion
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
,
"
replied
Luke
;
"
a
snug
old
house
—
a
model
of
a
farm
.
<EOS>
Everything
looks
comfortable
and
well
to
do
about
it
.
<EOS>
There
are
a
dozen
lusty
haystacks
,
or
thereabouts
;
and
the
great
barn
,
with
its
roof
yellowed
like
gold
,
looks
built
for
a
granary
;
and
there
are
stables
,
kine
-
houses
,
orchards
,
dovecots
,
and
fishponds
,
and
an
old
circular
garden
,
with
wall
-
fruit
in
abundance
.
<EOS>
He
should
be
a
happy
man
,
and
a
wealthy
one
,
who
dwells
therein
.
<EOS>
""He
dwells
therein
no
longer
,
"
returned
Peter
;
"
he
died
last
night
.
<EOS>
""How
know
you
that
?
<EOS>
None
are
stirring
in
the
house
as
yet
.
<EOS>
""The
owner
of
that
house
,
Simon
Toft
,
"
replied
Peter
,
"
was
last
night
struck
by
a
thunderbolt
.
<EOS>
He
was
one
of
the
coffin
-
bearers
at
your
father
's
funeral
.
<EOS>
They
are
sleeping
within
the
house
,
you
say
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
well
.
<EOS>
Let
them
sleep
on
—
they
will
awaken
too
soon
,
wake
when
they
may
—
ha
,
ha!""Peace
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Luke
;
"
you
blight
everything
—
even
this
smiling
landscape
you
would
turn
to
gloom
.
<EOS>
Does
not
this
morn
awaken
a
happier
train
of
thoughts
within
your
mind
?
<EOS>
With
me
it
makes
amends
for
want
of
sleep
,
effaces
resentment
,
and
banishes
every
black
misgiving
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
a
joyous
thing
thus
to
scour
the
country
at
earliest
dawn
;
to
catch
all
the
spirit
and
freshness
of
the
morning
;
to
be
abroad
before
the
lazy
world
is
half
awake
;
to
make
the
most
of
a
brief
existence
;
and
to
have
spent
a
day
of
keen
enjoyment
,
almost
before
the
day
begins
with
some
.
<EOS>
I
like
to
anticipate
the
rising
of
the
glorious
luminary
;
to
watch
every
line
of
light
changing
,
as
at
this
moment
,
from
shuddering
gray
to
blushing
rose
!
<EOS>
See
how
the
heavens
are
dyed
!
<EOS>
Who
would
exchange
yon
gorgeous
spectacle
,
"
continued
he
,
pointing
towards
the
east
,
and
again
urging
his
horse
to
full
speed
down
the
hill
,
endangering
the
sexton
's
seat
,
and
threatening
to
impale
him
upon
the
crupper
of
the
saddle—"who
<EOS>
would
exchange
that
sight
,
and
the
exhilarating
feeling
of
this
fresh
morn
,
for
a
couch
of
eiderdown
,
and
a
headache
in
reversion?""I
for
one
,
"
returned
the
sexton
,
sharply
,
"
would
willingly
exchange
it
for
that
,
or
any
other
couch
,
provided
it
rid
me
of
this
accursed
crupper
,
which
galls
me
sorely
.
<EOS>
Moderate
your
pace
,
grandson
Luke
,
or
I
must
throw
myself
off
the
horse
in
self
-
defence
.
<EOS>
"Luke
slackened
his
charger
's
pace
,
in
compliance
with
the
sexton
's
wish
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
well
,
"
continued
Peter
,
restored
in
a
measure
to
comfort
;
"
now
I
can
contemplate
the
sunrise
,
which
you
laud
,
somewhat
at
mine
ease
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
a
fine
sight
,
I
doubt
not
,
to
the
eyes
of
youth
;
and
,
to
the
sanguine
soul
of
him
upon
whom
life
itself
is
dawning
,
is
,
I
dare
say
,
inspiriting
:
but
when
the
heyday
of
existence
is
past
;
when
the
blood
flows
sluggishly
in
the
veins
;
when
one
has
known
the
desolating
storms
which
the
brightest
sunrise
has
preceded
,
the
seared
heart
refuses
to
trust
its
false
glitter
;
and
,
like
the
experienced
sailor
,
sees
oft
in
the
brightest
skies
a
forecast
of
the
tempest
.
<EOS>
To
such
a
one
,
there
can
be
no
new
dawn
of
the
heart
;
no
sun
can
gild
its
cold
and
cheerless
horizon
;
no
breeze
can
revive
pulses
that
have
long
since
ceased
to
throb
with
any
chance
emotion
.
<EOS>
I
am
too
old
to
feel
freshness
in
this
nipping
air
.
<EOS>
It
chills
me
more
than
the
damps
of
night
,
to
which
I
am
accustomed
.
<EOS>
Night
—
midnight
!
<EOS>
is
my
season
of
delight
.
<EOS>
Nature
is
instinct
then
with
secrets
dark
and
dread
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
language
<EOS>
which
he
who
sleepeth
not
,
but
will
wake
,
and
watch
,
may
haply
learn
.
<EOS>
Strange
organs
of
speech
hath
the
invisible
world
;
strange
language
doth
it
talk
;
strange
communion
hold
with
him
who
would
pry
into
its
mysteries
.
<EOS>
It
talks
by
bat
and
owl
—
by
the
grave
-
worm
,
and
by
each
crawling
thing
—
by
the
dust
of
graves
,
as
well
as
by
those
that
rot
therein
—
but
ever
doth
it
discourse
by
night
,
and
specially
when
the
moon
is
at
the
full
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
the
lore
I
have
then
learned
that
makes
that
season
dear
to
me
.
<EOS>
Like
your
cat
,
mine
eye
expands
in
darkness
.
<EOS>
I
blink
at
the
sunshine
,
like
your
owl
.
<EOS>
""Cease
<EOS>
this
forbidding
strain
,
"
returned
Luke
;
"
it
sounds
as
harshly
as
your
own
screech
-
owl
's
cry
.
<EOS>
Let
your
thoughts
take
a
more
sprightly
turn
,
more
in
unison
with
my
own
and
the
fair
aspect
of
nature
.
<EOS>
""Shall
I
direct
them
to
the
gipsies
'
camp
,
then
?
"
said
Peter
,
with
a
sneer
.
<EOS>
"
Do
your
own
thoughts
tend
thither?""You
are
not
altogether
in
the
wrong
,
"
replied
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
I
wasthinking
of
the
gipsies
'
camp
,
and
of
one
who
dwells
amongst
its
tents
.
<EOS>
""I
knew
it
,
"
replied
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
hope
to
deceive
me
by
attributing
all
your
joyousness
of
heart
to
the
dawn
?
<EOS>
Your
thoughts
have
been
wandering
all
this
while
upon
one
who
hath
,
I
will
engage
,
a
pair
of
sloe
-
black
eyes
,
an
olive
skin
,
and
yet
withal
a
clear
one—'black
,
yet
comely
,
as
the
tents
of
Kedar
,
as
the
curtains
of
Solomon'—a
mesh
of
jetty
hair
,
that
hath
entangled
you
in
its
network
—
ripe
lips
,
and
a
cunning
tongue
—
one
of
the
plagues
of
Egypt.—Ha
<EOS>
,
ha!""You
have
guessed
shrewdly
,
"
replied
Luke
;
"
I
care
not
to
own
that
my
thoughts
were
so
occupied
.
<EOS>
""I
was
assured
of
it
,
"
replied
the
sexton
.
"
<EOS>
And
what
may
be
the
name
of
her
towards
whom
your
imagination
was
straying?""Sibila
Perez
,
"
replied
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
father
was
a
Spanish
Gitano
.
<EOS>
She
is
known
amongst
her
people
by
her
mother
's
name
of
Lovel
.
<EOS>
""She
is
beautiful
,
of
course?""Ay
,
very
beautiful!—but
no
matter
!
<EOS>
You
shall
judge
of
her
charms
anon
.
<EOS>
""I
will
take
your
word
for
them
,
"
returned
the
sexton
;
"
and
you
love
her?""Passionately
.
<EOS>
""You
are
not
married
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Peter
,
hastily
.
"Not
<EOS>
as
yet
,
"
replied
Luke
;
"
but
my
faith
is
plighted
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
be
praised
!
<EOS>
The
mischief
is
not
then
irreparable
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
you
married
—
though
not
to
a
gipsy
girl
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
whom
would
you
select?""One
before
whom
Sybil
's
beauty
would
pale
as
stars
at
day
's
approach

<EOS>
""There
<EOS>
lives
not
such
a
one
.
<EOS>
""Trust
<EOS>
me
there
does
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
Mowbray
is
lovely
beyond
parallel
.
<EOS>
I
was
merely
speculating
upon
a
possibility
when
I
wished
her
yours
<EOS>
—
it
is
scarcely
likely
she
would
cast
her
eyes
upon
you
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
shall
not
heed
her
neglect
.
<EOS>
Graced
with
my
title
,
I
doubt
not
,
were
it
my
pleasure
to
seek
a
bride
amongst
those
of
gentle
blood
,
I
should
not
find
all
indifferent
to
my
suit
.
<EOS>
""Possibly
not
.
<EOS>
Yet
what
might
weigh
with
others
,
would
not
weigh
with
her
.
<EOS>
There
are
qualities
you
lack
which
she
has
discovered
in
another
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
whom?""In
<EOS>
Ranulph
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
he
her
suitor?""I
have
reason
to
think
so
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
you
would
have
me
abandon
my
own
betrothed
love
,
to
beguile
from
my
brother
his
destined
bride
?
<EOS>
That
were
to
imitate
the
conduct
of
my
grandsire
,
the
terrible
Sir
Reginald
,
towards
his
brother
Alan
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
sexton
answered
not
,
and
Luke
fancied
he
could
perceive
a
quivering
in
the
hands
that
grasped
his
body
for
support
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
brief
pause
in
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
who
is
Eleanor
Mowbray
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Luke
,
breaking
the
silence
.
<EOS>
"Your
cousin
.
<EOS>
On
the
mother
's
side
a
Rookwood
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
therefore
I
would
urge
your
union
with
her
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
prophecy
relating
to
your
house
,
which
seems
as
though
it
would
be
fulfilled
in
your
person
and
in
hers
:
When
the
stray
Rook
shall
perch
on
the
topmost
bough
,
There
shall
be
clamor
and
screaming
,
I
trow;But
of
right
,
and
of
rule
,
of
the
ancient
nest
,
The
Rook
that
with
Rook
mates
shall
hold
him
possest
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
place
no
faith
in
such
fantasies
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Luke
;
"
and
yet
the
lines
bear
strangely
upon
my
present
situation
.
<EOS>
""Their
<EOS>
application
to
yourself
and
Eleanor
Mowbray
is
unquestionable
,
"
replied
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"It
would
seem
so
,
indeed
,
"
rejoined
Luke
;
and
he
again
sank
into
abstraction
,
from
which
the
sexton
did
not
care
to
arouse
him
.
<EOS>
The
aspect
of
the
country
had
materially
changed
since
their
descent
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
In
place
of
the
richly
-
cultivated
district
which
lay
on
the
other
side
,
a
broad
brown
tract
of
waste
land
spread
out
before
them
,
covered
with
scattered
patches
of
gorse
,
stunted
fern
,
and
low
brushwood
,
presenting
an
unvaried
surface
of
unbaked
turf
.
<EOS>
The
shallow
coat
of
sod
was
manifested
by
the
stones
that
clattered
under
the
horse
's
hoofs
as
he
rapidly
traversed
the
arid
soil
,
clearing
with
ease
to
himself
,
though
not
without
discomfort
to
the
sexton
,
every
gravelly
trench
,
natural
chasm
,
or
other
inequality
of
ground
that
occurred
in
his
course
.
<EOS>
Clinging
to
his
grandson
with
the
tenacity
of
a
bird
of
prey
,
Peter
for
some
time
kept
his
station
in
security
;
but
,
unluckily
,
at
one
dike
rather
wider
than
the
rest
,
the
horse
,
owing
possibly
to
the
mismanagement
,
intentional
or
otherwise
,
of
Luke
,
swerved
;
and
the
sexton
,
dislodged
from
his
"
high
estate
,
"
fell
at
the
edge
of
the
trench
,
and
rolled
incontinently
to
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
Luke
drew
in
the
rein
to
inquire
if
any
bones
were
broken
;
and
Peter
presently
upreared
his
dusty
person
from
the
abyss
,
and
without
condescending
to
make
any
reply
,
yet
muttering
curses
,
"
not
loud
,
but
deep
,
"
accepted
his
grandson
's
proffered
hand
,
and
remounted
.
<EOS>
While
thus
occupied
,
Luke
fancied
he
heard
a
distant
shout
,
and
noting
whence
the
sound
proceeded
—
the
same
quarter
by
which
he
had
approached
the
heath
—
he
beheld
a
single
horseman
spurring
in
their
direction
at
the
top
of
his
speed
;
and
to
judge
from
the
rate
at
which
he
advanced
,
it
was
evident
he
was
anything
but
indifferently
mounted
.
<EOS>
Apprehensive
of
pursuit
,
Luke
expedited
the
sexton
's
ascent
;
and
that
accomplished
,
without
bestowing
further
regard
upon
the
object
of
his
solicitude
,
he
resumed
his
headlong
flight
.
<EOS>
He
now
thought
it
necessary
to
bestow
more
attention
on
his
choice
of
road
,
and
,
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
heath
,
avoided
all
unnecessary
hazardous
passes
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
knowledge
of
the
ground
,
and
the
excellence
of
his
horse
,
the
stranger
sensibly
gained
upon
him
.
<EOS>
The
danger
,
however
,
was
no
longer
imminent
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
are
safe
,
"
cried
Luke
;
"
the
limits
of
Hardchase
are
past
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
seconds
we
shall
enter
Davenham
Wood
.
<EOS>
I
will
turn
the
horse
loose
,
and
we
will
betake
ourselves
to
flight
amongst
the
trees
.
<EOS>
I
will
show
you
a
place
of
concealment
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
follow
us
on
horseback
,
and
on
foot
I
defy
him
.
<EOS>
""Stay
,
"
cried
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
not
in
pursuit
—
he
takes
another
course
—
he
wheels
to
the
right
.
<EOS>
By
Heaven
!
<EOS>
it
is
the
Fiend
himself
upon
a
black
horse
,
come
for
Bow
-
legged
Ben
.
<EOS>
See
,
he
is
there
already
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
horseman
had
turned
,
as
the
sexton
stated
,
careering
towards
a
revolting
object
at
some
little
distance
on
the
right
hand
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
gibbet
,
with
its
grisly
burden
.
<EOS>
He
rode
swiftly
towards
it
,
and
,
reining
in
his
horse
,
took
off
his
hat
,
bowing
profoundly
to
the
carcase
that
swung
in
the
morning
breeze
.
<EOS>
Just
at
that
moment
a
gust
of
air
catching
the
fleshless
skeleton
,
its
arms
seemed
to
be
waved
in
reply
to
the
salutation
.
<EOS>
A
solitary
crow
winged
its
flight
over
the
horseman
's
head
as
he
paused
.
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
halt
,
he
wheeled
about
,
and
again
shouted
to
Luke
,
waving
his
hat
.
<EOS>
"As
I
live
,
"
said
the
latter
,
"
it
is
Jack
Palmer
.
<EOS>
""Dick
<EOS>
Turpin
,
you
mean
,
"
rejoined
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
paying
his
respects
to
a
brother
blade
.
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
Dick
will
never
have
the
honor
of
a
gibbet
;
he
is
too
tender
of
the
knife
.
<EOS>
Did
you
mark
the
crow
?
<EOS>
But
here
he
comes
.
<EOS>
"
And
in
another
instant
Turpin
was
by
their
side
.

said
Turpin
,
as
he
rode
up
at
an
easy
canter
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
not
hear
my
halloo
?
<EOS>
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
you
on
the
hill
yonder
.
<EOS>
I
knew
you
both
,
two
miles
off
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
having
a
word
or
two
to
say
to
you
,
Luke
Bradley
,
before
I
leave
this
part
of
the
country
,
I
put
Bess
to
it
,
and
she
soon
brought
me
within
hail
.
<EOS>
Bless
her
black
skin
,
"
added
he
,
affectionately
patting
his
horse
's
neck
,
"
there
's
not
her
match
in
these
parts
,
or
in
any
other
;
she
wants
no
coaxing
to
do
her
work
—
<EOS>
no
bleeders
for
her
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
up
with
you
before
this
had
I
not
taken
a
cross
cut
to
look
at
poor
Ben
.
<EOS>
One
night
,
when
mounted
on
my
mare
.
<EOS>
To
Bagshot
Heath
<EOS>
I
did
repair
,
And
saw
Will
Davies
hanging
there
,
Upon
the
gibbet
bleak
and
bare
,
With
a
rustified
,
fustified
,
mustified
air
.
<EOS>
Excuse
my
singing
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
a
gibbet
always
puts
me
in
mind
of
the
Golden
Farmer
.
<EOS>
May
I
ask
whither
you
are
bound
,
comrades?""Comrades
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
the
sexton
to
Luke
;
<EOS>
"
you
see
he
does
not
so
easily
forget
his
old
friends
.
<EOS>
""I
have
business
that
will
not
admit
of
delay
,
"
rejoined
Luke
;
"
and
to
speak
plainly——""You
want
not
my
society
,
"
returned
Turpin
;
"
I
guessed
as
much
.
<EOS>
Natural
enough
!
<EOS>
You
have
got
an
inkling
of
your
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
You
have
found
out
you
are
a
rich
man
's
heir
,
not
a
poor
wench
's
bastard
.
<EOS>
No
offence
;
I
'm
a
plain
spoken
man
,
as
you
will
find
,
if
you
know
it
not
already
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
objection
to
your
playing
these
fine
tricks
on
others
,
though
it
wo
n't
answer
your
turn
to
do
so
with
me
.
""Sir
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Luke
,
sharply
.
"Sir
<EOS>
to
you
,
"
replied
Turpin—"Sir
Luke
—
as
I
suppose
you
would
now
choose
to
be
addressed
.
<EOS>
I
am
aware
of
all
.
<EOS>
A
nod
is
as
good
as
a
wink
to
me
.
<EOS>
Last
night
I
learned
the
fact
of
Sir
Piers
's
marriage
from
Lady
Rookwood
—
ay
,
from
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
You
stare
—
and
old
Peter
,
there
,
opens
his
ogles
now
.
<EOS>
She
let
it
out
by
accident
;
and
I
am
in
possession
of
what
can
alone
substantiate
your
father
's
first
marriage
,
and
establish
your
claims
to
the
property
.
<EOS>
""The
devil
!
"
cried
the
sexton
;
adding
,
in
a
whisper
to
Luke
,
"
You
had
better
not
be
precipitate
in
dropping
so
obliging
an
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
""You
are
jesting
,
"
said
Luke
to
Turpin
.
<EOS>
"It
is
ill
jesting
before
breakfast
,
"
returned
Dick
:
"
<EOS>
I
am
seldom
in
the
mood
for
a
joke
so
early
.
<EOS>
What
if
a
certain
marriage
certificate
had
fallen
into
my
hand?""A
marriage
certificate
!
"
echoed
Luke
and
the
sexton
simultaneously
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
only
existing
proof
of
the
union
of
Sir
Piers
Rookwood
with
Susan
Bradley
,
"
continued
Turpin
.
<EOS>
"
What
if
I
had
stumbled
upon
such
a
document
—
nay
more
,
if
I
knew
where
to
direct
you
to
it?""Peace
!
"
cried
Luke
to
his
tormentor
;
and
then
addressing
Turpin
,
"
if
what
you
say
be
true
,
my
quest
is
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
All
that
I
need
,
you
appear
to
possess
.
<EOS>
Other
proofs
are
secondary
to
this
.
<EOS>
I
know
with
whom
I
have
to
deal
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
demand
for
that
certificate?""We
<EOS>
will
talk
about
the
matter
after
breakfast
,
"
said
Turpin
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
treat
with
you
as
friend
with
friend
.
<EOS>
Meet
me
on
those
terms
,
and
I
am
your
man
;
reject
my
offer
,
and
I
turn
my
mare
's
head
,
and
ride
back
to
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
With
me
now
rest
all
your
hopes
.
<EOS>
I
have
dealt
fairly
with
you
,
and
I
expect
to
be
fairly
dealt
with
in
return
.
<EOS>
It
were
idle
to
say
,
now
I
have
an
opportunity
,
that
I
should
not
turn
this
luck
to
my
account
.
<EOS>
I
were
a
fool
to
do
otherwise
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
expect
it
.
<EOS>
And
then
I
have
Rust
and
Wilder
to
settle
with
.
<EOS>
Though
I
have
left
them
behind
,
they
know
my
destination
.
<EOS>
We
have
been
old
associates
.
<EOS>
I
like
your
spirit
—
I
care
not
for
your
haughtiness
;
but
I
will
not
help
you
up
the
ladder
to
be
kicked
down
myself
.
<EOS>
Now
you
understand
me
.
<EOS>
Whither
are
you
bound?""To
Davenham
Priory
,
the
gipsy
camp
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
gipsies
are
your
friends?""They
are
.
<EOS>
""I
am
alone
.
<EOS>
""You
are
safe
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
pledge
your
word
that
all
shall
be
on
the
square
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
mention
to
one
of
that
canting
crew
what
I
have
told
you?""With
one
exception
,
you
may
rely
upon
my
secrecy
.
<EOS>
""Whom
<EOS>
do
you
except?""A
woman
.
""Bad
!
<EOS>
never
trust
a
petticoat

<EOS>
""I
will
answer
for
her
with
my
life
.
""And
<EOS>
for
your
granddad
there?""He
will
answer
for
himself
,
"
said
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
fear
treachery
in
me
.
<EOS>
Honor
among
thieves
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
""Or
where
else
should
you
seek
it
?
<EOS>
"
rejoined
Turpin
;
"
for
it
has
left
all
other
classes
of
society
.
<EOS>
Your
highwayman
is
your
only
man
of
honor
.
<EOS>
I
will
trust
you
both
;
and
you
shall
find
you
may
trust
me
.
<EOS>
After
breakfast
,
as
I
said
before
,
we
will
bring
the
matter
to
a
conclusion
.
<EOS>
Tip
us
your
daddle
,
Sir
Luke
,
and
<EOS>
I
am
satisfied
.
<EOS>
You
shall
rule
in
Rookwood
<EOS>
,
I
'll
engage
,
ere
a
week
be
flown
;
and
then
—
—
<EOS>
But
so
much
parleying
is
dull
work
;
let
's
make
the
best
of
our
way
to
breakfast
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
away
they
cantered
.
<EOS>
A
narrow
bridle
-
road
conducted
them
singly
through
the
defiles
of
a
thick
wood
.
<EOS>
Their
route
lay
in
the
shade
,
and
the
air
felt
chilly
amidst
the
trees
,
the
sun
not
having
attained
sufficient
altitude
to
penetrate
its
depths
,
while
overhead
all
was
warmth
and
light
.
<EOS>
Quivering
on
the
tops
of
the
timber
,
the
horizontal
sunbeams
created
,
in
their
refraction
,
brilliant
prismatic
colorings
,
and
filled
the
air
with
motes
like
golden
dust
.
<EOS>
Our
horsemen
heeded
not
the
sunshine
or
the
shade
.
<EOS>
Occupied
each
with
his
own
train
of
thought
,
they
silently
rode
on
.
<EOS>
Davenham
Wood
,
through
which
they
urged
their
course
,
had
,
in
the
olden
time
,
been
a
forest
of
some
extent
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
an
appendage
to
the
domains
of
Rookwood
,
but
had
passed
from
the
hands
of
that
family
to
those
of
a
wealthy
adjoining
landowner
and
lawyer
,
Sir
Edward
Davenham
,
in
the
keeping
of
whose
descendants
it
had
ever
after
continued
.
<EOS>
A
noble
wood
it
was
,
and
numbered
many
patriarchal
trees
.
<EOS>
Ancient
oaks
,
with
broad
,
gnarled
limbs
,
which
the
storms
of
five
hundred
years
had
vainly
striven
to
uproot
,
and
which
were
now
sternly
decaying
;
gigantic
beech
trees
,
with
silvery
stems
shooting
smoothly
upwards
,
sustaining
branches
of
such
size
,
that
each
,
dissevered
,
would
in
itself
have
formed
a
tree
,
populous
with
leaves
,
and
variegated
with
rich
autumnal
tints
;
the
sprightly
sycamore
,
the
dark
chestnut
,
the
weird
wych
-
elm
,
the
majestic
elm
itself
,
festooned
with
ivy
,
every
variety
of
wood
,
dark
,
dense
,
and
intricate
,
composed
the
forest
through
which
they
rode
;
and
so
multitudinous
was
the
timber
,
so
closely
planted
,
so
entirely
filled
up
with
a
thick
,
matted
vegetation
,
which
had
been
allowed
to
collect
beneath
,
that
little
view
was
afforded
,
<EOS>
had
any
been
desired
by
the
parties
,
into
the
labyrinth
of
the
grove
.
<EOS>
Tree
after
tree
,
clad
in
the
glowing
livery
of
the
season
,
was
passed
,
and
as
rapidly
succeeded
by
others
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
a
bough
projected
over
their
path
,
compelling
the
riders
to
incline
their
heads
as
they
passed
;
but
,
heedless
of
such
difficulties
,
they
pressed
on
.
<EOS>
Now
the
road
grew
lighter
,
and
they
became
at
once
sensible
of
the
genial
influence
of
the
sun
.
<EOS>
The
transition
was
as
agreeable
as
instantaneous
.
<EOS>
They
had
opened
upon
an
extensive
plantation
of
full
-
grown
pines
,
whose
tall
,
branchless
stems
grew
up
like
a
forest
of
masts
,
and
freely
admitted
the
pleasant
sunshine
.
<EOS>
Beneath
those
trees
,
the
soil
was
sandy
and
destitute
of
all
undergrowth
,
though
covered
with
brown
,
hair
-
like
fibres
and
dry
cones
,
shed
by
the
pines
.
<EOS>
The
agile
squirrel
,
that
freest
denizen
of
the
grove
,
starting
from
the
ground
as
the
horsemen
galloped
on
,
sprang
up
the
nearest
tree
,
and
might
be
seen
angrily
gazing
at
the
disturbers
of
his
haunts
,
beating
the
branches
with
his
fore
feet
,
in
expression
of
displeasure
;
the
rabbit
darted
across
their
path
;
the
jays
flew
screaming
amongst
the
foliage
;
the
blue
cushat
,
scared
at
the
clatter
of
the
horses
'
hoofs
,
sped
on
swift
wing
into
quarters
secure
from
their
approach
;
while
the
parti
-
colored
pies
,
like
curious
village
gossips
,
congregated
to
peer
at
the
strangers
,
expressing
their
astonishment
by
loud
and
continuous
chattering
.
<EOS>
Though
so
gentle
of
ascent
as
to
be
almost
imperceptible
,
it
was
still
evident
that
the
path
they
were
pursuing
gradually
mounted
a
hill
-
side
;
and
when
at
length
they
reached
an
opening
,
the
view
disclosed
the
eminence
they
had
insensibly
won
.
<EOS>
Pausing
for
a
moment
upon
the
brow
of
the
hill
,
Luke
pointed
to
a
stream
that
wound
through
the
valley
,
and
,
tracing
its
course
,
indicated
a
particular
spot
amongst
the
trees
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
appearance
of
a
dwelling
house
—
no
cottage
roof
,
no
white
canvas
shed
,
to
point
out
the
tents
of
the
wandering
tribe
whose
abode
they
were
seeking
.
<EOS>
The
only
circumstance
betokening
that
it
had
once
been
the
haunt
of
man
were
a
few
gray
monastic
ruins
,
scarce
distinguishable
from
the
stony
barrier
by
which
they
were
surrounded
;
and
the
sole
evidence
that
it
was
still
frequented
by
human
beings
was
a
thin
column
of
pale
blue
smoke
,
that
arose
in
curling
wreaths
from
out
the
brake
,
the
light
-
colored
vapor
beautifully
contrasting
with
the
green
umbrage
whence
it
issued
.
<EOS>
"Our
<EOS>
destination
is
yonder
,
"
exclaimed
Luke
,
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
vapor
.
<EOS>
"I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
cried
Turpin
,
"
as
well
as
to
perceive
there
is
some
one
awake
.
<EOS>
That
smoke
holds
out
a
prospect
of
breakfast
.
<EOS>
No
smoke
without
fire
,
as
old
Lady
Scanmag
said
;
and
I
'll
wager
a
trifle
that
fire
was
not
lighted
for
the
fayter
fellows
to
count
their
fingers
by
.
<EOS>
We
shall
find
three
sticks
,
and
a
black
pot
with
a
kid
seething
in
it
,
I
'll
engage
.
<EOS>
These
gipsies
have
picked
out
a
prettyish
spot
to
quarter
in
—
quite
picturesque
,
as
one
may
say
—
and
but
for
that
tell
-
tale
smoke
,
which
looks
for
all
the
world
like
a
Dutch
skipper
blowing
his
morning
cloud
,
no
one
need
know
of
their
vicinity
.
<EOS>
A
pretty
place
,
upon
my
soul
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
spot
,
in
sooth
,
merited
Turpin
's
eulogium
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
valley
,
in
the
midst
of
wooded
hills
,
so
secluded
,
that
not
a
single
habitation
appeared
in
view
.
<EOS>
Clothed
with
timber
to
the
very
summits
,
excepting
on
the
side
where
the
party
stood
,
which
verged
upon
the
declivity
,
these
mountainous
ridges
presented
a
broken
outline
of
foliage
,
variegated
with
tinted
masses
of
bright
orange
,
timber
,
and
deepest
green
.
<EOS>
Four
hills
hemmed
in
the
valley
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
a
gray
slab
of
rock
might
be
discerned
amongst
the
wood
,
and
a
mountain
-
ash
figured
conspicuously
upon
a
jutting
crag
immediately
below
them
.
<EOS>
Deep
sunken
in
the
ravine
,
and
concealed
in
part
from
view
by
the
wild
herbage
and
dwarf
shrubs
,
ran
a
range
of
precipitous
rocks
,
severed
,
it
would
seem
,
by
some
diluvial
convulsion
,
from
the
opposite
mountain
side
,
as
a
corresponding
rift
was
there
visible
,
in
which
the
same
dip
of
strata
might
be
observed
,
together
with
certain
ribbed
cavities
,
matching
huge
bolts
of
rock
which
had
once
locked
these
stony
walls
together
.
<EOS>
Washing
this
cliff
,
swept
a
clear
stream
,
well
known
and
well
regarded
,
as
it
waxed
in
width
,
by
the
honest
brethren
of
the
angle
,
who
seldom
,
however
,
tracked
it
to
its
rise
amongst
these
hills
.
<EOS>
The
stream
found
its
way
into
the
valley
through
a
chasm
far
to
the
left
,
and
rushed
thundering
down
the
mountain
side
in
a
boiling
cascade
.
<EOS>
The
valley
was
approached
in
this
direction
from
Rookwood
by
an
unfrequented
carriage
-
road
,
which
Luke
had
,
from
prudential
reasons
,
avoided
.
<EOS>
All
seemed
consecrated
to
silence
—
to
solitude
—
to
the
hush
of
nature
;
yet
this
quiet
scene
was
the
chosen
retreat
of
lawless
depredators
,
and
had
erstwhile
been
the
theatre
of
feudal
oppression
.
<EOS>
We
have
said
that
no
habitation
was
visible
;
that
no
dwelling
tenanted
by
man
could
be
seen
;
but
following
the
spur
of
the
furthest
mountain
hill
,
some
traces
of
a
stone
wall
might
be
discovered
;
and
upon
a
natural
platform
of
rock
stood
a
stern
square
tower
,
which
had
once
been
the
donjon
of
the
castle
,
the
lords
of
which
had
called
the
four
hills
their
own
.
<EOS>
A
watch
-
tower
then
had
crowned
each
eminence
,
every
vestige
of
which
had
,
however
,
long
since
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Sequestered
in
the
vale
stood
the
Priory
before
alluded
to
—
a
Monastery
of
Gray
Friars
,
of
the
Order
of
St.
Francis
—
some
of
the
venerable
walls
of
which
were
still
remaining
;
and
if
they
had
not
reverted
to
the
bat
and
the
owl
,
as
is
wo
nt
to
be
the
fate
of
such
sacred
structures
,
their
cloistered
shrines
were
devoted
to
beings
whose
natures
partook
,
in
some
measure
,
of
the
instincts
of
those
creatures
of
the
night
—
a
people
whose
deeds
were
of
darkness
,
and
whose
eyes
shunned
the
light
.
<EOS>
Here
the
gipsies
had
pitched
their
tent
;
and
though
the
place
was
often
,
in
part
,
deserted
by
the
vagrant
horde
,
yet
certain
of
the
tribe
,
who
had
grown
into
years
—
over
whom
Barbara
Lovel
held
queenly
sway
—
made
it
their
haunt
,
and
were
suffered
by
the
authorities
of
the
neighborhood
to
remain
unmolested
—
a
lenient
piece
of
policy
,
which
,
in
our
infinite
regard
for
the
weal
of
the
tawny
tribe
,
we
recommend
to
the
adoption
of
all
other
justices
and
knights
of
the
shire
.
<EOS>
Bidding
his
grandsire
have
regard
to
his
seat
,
Luke
leaped
a
high
bank
;
and
,
followed
by
Turpin
,
began
to
descend
the
hill
.
<EOS>
Peter
,
however
,
took
care
to
provide
for
himself
.
<EOS>
The
descent
was
so
perilous
,
and
the
footing
so
insecure
,
that
he
chose
rather
to
trust
to
such
conveyance
as
nature
had
furnished
him
with
,
than
to
hazard
his
neck
by
any
false
step
of
the
horse
.
<EOS>
He
contrived
,
therefore
,
to
slide
off
from
behind
,
shaping
his
own
course
in
a
more
secure
direction
.
<EOS>
He
who
has
wandered
amidst
the
Alps
must
have
often
had
occasion
to
witness
the
wonderful
surefootedness
of
that
mountain
pilot
,
the
mule
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
remarked
how
,
with
tenacious
hoof
,
he
will
claw
the
rock
,
and
drag
himself
from
one
impending
fragment
to
another
,
with
perfect
security
to
his
rider
;
how
he
will
breast
the
roaring
currents
of
air
,
and
stand
unshrinking
at
the
verge
of
almost
unfathomable
ravines
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
so
with
the
horse
:
<EOS>
fleet
on
the
plain
,
careful
over
rugged
ground
,
he
is
timid
and
uncertain
on
the
hill
-
side
,
and
the
risk
incurred
by
Luke
and
Turpin
,
in
their
descent
of
the
almost
perpendicular
sides
of
the
cliff
,
was
tremendous
.
<EOS>
Peter
watched
them
in
their
descent
with
some
admiration
,
and
with
much
contempt
.
<EOS>
"He
will
break
his
neck
,
of
a
surety
,
"
said
he
;
"
but
what
matters
it
?
<EOS>
As
well
now
as
hereafter
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
approached
the
verge
of
the
precipice
,
where
he
could
see
them
more
distinctly
.
<EOS>
The
passage
along
which
Luke
rode
had
never
before
been
traversed
by
horse
's
hoof
.
<EOS>
Cut
in
the
rock
,
it
presented
a
steep
zigzag
path
amongst
the
cliffs
,
without
any
defence
for
the
foot
traveller
,
except
such
as
was
afforded
by
a
casual
clinging
shrub
,
and
no
protection
whatever
existed
for
a
horseman
;
the
possibility
of
any
one
attempting
the
passage
not
having
,
in
all
probability
,
entered
into
the
calculation
of
those
who
framed
it
.
<EOS>
Added
to
this
,
the
steps
were
of
such
unequal
heights
,
and
withal
so
narrow
,
that
the
danger
was
proportionately
increased
.
<EOS>
"Ten
thousand
devils
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Turpin
,
staring
downwards
,
"
is
this
<EOS>
the
best
road
you
have
got?""You
will
find
one
more
easy
,
"
replied
Luke
,
"
if
you
ride
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
wood
,
and
then
return
by
the
brook
side
.
<EOS>
You
will
meet
me
at
the
priory
.
<EOS>
""No
,
"
answered
the
highwayman
,
boldly
;
"
if
you
go
,
I
go
too
.
<EOS>
It
shall
never
be
said
that
Dick
Turpin
was
afraid
to
follow
where
another
would
lead
.
<EOS>
Proceed
.
<EOS>
"Luke
gave
his
horse
the
bridle
,
and
the
animal
slowly
and
steadily
commenced
the
descent
,
fixing
his
fore
legs
upon
the
steps
,
and
drawing
his
hinder
limbs
carefully
after
him
.
<EOS>
Here
it
was
that
the
lightness
and
steadiness
of
Turpin
's
mare
was
completely
shown
.
<EOS>
No
Alpine
mule
could
have
borne
its
rider
with
more
apparent
ease
and
safety
.
<EOS>
Turpin
encouraged
her
by
hand
and
word
;
but
she
needed
it
not
.
<EOS>
The
sexton
saw
them
,
and
,
tracking
their
giddy
descent
,
he
became
more
interested
than
he
anticipated
.
<EOS>
His
attention
was
suddenly
drawn
towards
Luke
.
<EOS>
"He
is
gone
,
"
cried
Peter
.
"
<EOS>
He
falls
—
<EOS>
he
sinks
—
my
plans
are
all
defeated
—
the
last
link
is
snapped
.
<EOS>
No
,
"
added
he
,
recovering
his
wonted
composure
,
"
<EOS>
his
end
is
not
so
fated
.
<EOS>
"Rook
had
missed
his
footing
.
<EOS>
He
rolled
stumbling
down
the
precipice
a
few
yards
.
<EOS>
Luke
's
fate
seemed
inevitable
.
<EOS>
His
feet
were
entangled
in
the
stirrup
,
he
could
not
free
himself
.
<EOS>
A
birch
tree
,
growing
in
a
chink
of
the
precipice
,
arrested
his
further
fall
.
<EOS>
But
for
this
timely
aid
all
had
been
over
.
<EOS>
Here
Luke
was
enabled
to
extricate
himself
from
the
stirrup
and
to
regain
his
feet
;
seizing
the
bridle
,
he
dragged
his
faulty
steed
back
again
to
the
road
.
<EOS>
"You
have
had
a
narrow
escape
,
by
Jove
,
"
said
Turpin
,
who
had
been
thunderstruck
with
the
whole
proceeding
.
<EOS>
"
Those
big
cattle
are
always
clumsy
;
devilish
lucky
<EOS>
it
's
no
worse
.
<EOS>
"It
was
now
comparatively
smooth
travelling
;
but
they
had
not
as
yet
reached
the
valley
,
and
it
seemed
to
be
Luke
's
object
to
take
a
circuitous
path
.
<EOS>
This
was
so
evident
that
Turpin
could
not
help
commenting
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Luke
evaded
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
The
crag
is
steep
there
,
"
said
he
;
"
besides
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
want
to
surprise
them
.
<EOS>
""Ho
,
ho
!
"
laughed
Dick
.
"
<EOS>
Surprise
them
,
eh
?
<EOS>
What
a
pity
the
birch
tree
was
in
the
way
;
you
would
have
done
it
properly
then
.
<EOS>
Egad
,
here
's
another
surprise
.
<EOS>
"Dick
's
last
exclamation
was
caused
by
his
having
suddenly
come
upon
a
wide
gully
in
the
rock
,
through
which
dashed
a
headlong
torrent
,
crossed
by
a
single
plank
.
<EOS>
"You
must
be
mad
to
have
taken
this
road
,
"
cried
Turpin
,
gazing
down
into
the
roaring
depths
in
which
the
waterfall
raged
,
and
measuring
the
distance
of
the
pass
with
his
eye
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
,
so
,
Bess!—Ay
,
look
at
it
,
wench
.
<EOS>
Curse
me
,
Luke
,
if
I
think
your
horse
will
do
it
,
and
,
therefore
,
turn
him
loose
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
Dick
might
as
well
have
bidden
the
cataract
to
flow
backwards
.
<EOS>
Luke
struck
his
heels
into
his
horse
's
sides
.
<EOS>
The
steed
galloped
to
the
brink
,
snorted
,
and
refused
the
leap
.
<EOS>
"I
told
you
so
—
he
ca
n't
do
it
,
"
said
Turpin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
if
you
are
obstinate
,
a
wilful
man
must
have
his
way
.
<EOS>
Stand
aside
,
while
I
try
it
for
you
.
"
<EOS>
Patting
Bess
,
he
put
her
to
a
gallop
.
<EOS>
She
cleared
the
gulf
bravely
,
landing
her
rider
safely
upon
the
opposite
rock
.
<EOS>
"Now
<EOS>
then
,
"
cried
Turpin
,
from
the
other
side
of
the
chasm
.
<EOS>
Luke
again
urged
his
steed
.
<EOS>
Encouraged
by
what
he
had
seen
,
this
time
the
horse
sprang
across
without
hesitation
.
<EOS>
The
next
instant
they
were
in
the
valley
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
they
rode
along
the
banks
of
the
stream
in
silence
.
<EOS>
A
sound
at
length
caught
the
quick
ears
of
the
highwayman
.
<EOS>
"Hist
<EOS>
!
"
cried
he
;
"
some
one
sings
.
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
it?""I
do
,
"
replied
Luke
,
the
blood
rushing
to
his
cheeks
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
could
give
a
guess
at
the
singer
,
no
doubt
,
"
said
Turpin
,
with
a
knowing
look
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Was
it
to
hear
yon
woodlark
that
you
nearly
broke
your
own
neck
,
and
put
mine
in
jeopardy?""Prithee
<EOS>
be
silent
,
"
whispered
Luke
.
<EOS>
"I
am
dumb
,
"
replied
Turpin
;
"
I
like
a
sweet
voice
as
well
as
another
.
"Clear
<EOS>
as
the
note
of
a
bird
,
yet
melancholy
as
the
distant
dole
of
a
vesper
-
bell
,
arose
the
sound
of
that
sweet
voice
from
the
wood
.
<EOS>
A
fragment
of
a
Spanish
gipsy
song
it
warbled
:
Luke
knew
it
well
.
<EOS>
Thus
ran
the
romance
:
LA
GITANILLABy
the
Guadalquivir
,
Ere
the
sun
be
flown
,
By
that
glorious
riverSits
a
maid
alone
.
<EOS>
Like
the
sunset
splendorOf
that
current
bright
,
Shone
her
dark
eyes
tenderAs
its
witching
light
.
<EOS>
Like
the
ripple
flowing
,
Tinged
with
purple
sheen
,
Darkly
,
richly
glowing
,
Is
her
warm
cheek
seen
.
<EOS>
'Tis
the
GitanillaBy
<EOS>
the
stream
doth
linger
,
In
the
hope
that
eveWill
her
lover
bring
her
.
<EOS>
See
,
the
sun
is
sinking;All
grows
dim
,
and
dies;See
,
the
waves
are
drinkingGlories
of
the
skies
.
<EOS>
Day
's
last
lustre
playethOn
that
current
dark;Yet
no
speck
betrayethHis
long
looked
-
for
bark
.
<EOS>
'Tis
<EOS>
the
hour
of
meeting!Nay
,
the
hour
is
past;Swift
the
time
is
fleeting!Fleeteth
hope
as
fast
.
<EOS>
Still
the
GitanillaBy
the
stream
doth
linger
,
In
the
hope
that
nightWill
her
lover
bring
her
.
<EOS>
The
tender
trembling
of
a
guitar
was
heard
in
accompaniment
of
the
ravishing
melodist
.
<EOS>
The
song
ceased
.
<EOS>
"Where
<EOS>
is
the
bird
?
"
asked
Turpin
.
<EOS>
"Move
<EOS>
on
in
silence
,
<EOS>
and
you
shall
see
,
"
said
Luke
;
and
keeping
upon
the
turf
,
so
that
his
horse
's
tread
became
inaudible
,
he
presently
arrived
at
a
spot
where
,
through
the
boughs
,
the
object
of
his
investigation
could
plainly
be
distinguished
,
though
he
himself
was
concealed
from
view
.
<EOS>
Upon
a
platform
of
rock
,
rising
to
the
height
of
the
trees
,
nearly
perpendicularly
from
the
river
's
bed
,
appeared
the
figure
of
the
gipsy
maid
.
<EOS>
Her
footstep
rested
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
abrupt
cliff
,
at
whose
base
the
water
boiled
in
a
deep
whirlpool
,
and
the
bounding
chamois
could
not
have
been
more
lightly
poised
.
<EOS>
One
small
hand
rested
upon
her
guitar
,
the
other
pressed
her
brow
.
<EOS>
Braided
hair
,
of
the
jettiest
dye
and
sleekest
texture
,
was
twined
around
her
brow
in
endless
twisted
folds
:
<EOS>
Rowled
it
was
in
many
a
curious
fret
,
Much
like
a
rich
and
curious
coronet
,
Upon
whose
arches
twenty
Cupids
lay
,
And
were
as
tied
,
or
loth
to
fly
away.[24]And
<EOS>
so
exuberant
was
this
rarest
feminine
ornament
,
that
,
after
encompassing
her
brow
,
it
was
passed
behind
,
and
hung
down
in
long
thick
plaits
almost
to
her
feet
.
<EOS>
Sparkling
,
as
the
sunbeams
that
played
upon
her
dark
yet
radiant
features
,
were
the
large
,
black
,
Oriental
eyes
of
the
maiden
,
and
shaded
with
lashes
long
and
silken
.
<EOS>
Hers
was
a
Moorish
countenance
,
in
which
the
magnificence
of
the
eyes
eclipses
the
face
,
be
it
ever
so
beautiful
—
an
effect
to
be
observed
in
the
angelic
pictures
of
Murillo,—and
the
lovely
contour
is
scarcely
noticed
in
the
gaze
which
those
long
,
languid
,
luminous
orbs
attract
.
<EOS>
Sybil
's
features
were
exquisite
,
yet
you
looked
only
at
her
eyes
—
they
were
the
loadstars
of
her
countenance
.
<EOS>
Her
costume
was
singular
,
and
partook
,
like
herself
,
of
other
climes
.
<EOS>
Like
the
Andalusian
dame
,
her
choice
of
color
inclined
towards
black
,
as
the
material
of
most
of
her
dress
was
of
that
sombre
hue
.
<EOS>
A
bodice
of
embroidered
velvet
restrained
her
delicate
bosom
's
swell
;
a
rich
girdle
,
from
which
depended
a
silver
chain
,
sustaining
a
short
poniard
,
bound
her
waist
;
around
her
slender
throat
was
twined
a
costly
kerchief
;
and
the
rest
of
her
dress
was
calculated
to
display
her
slight
,
yet
faultless
,
figure
to
the
fullest
advantage
.
<EOS>
Unconscious
that
she
was
the
object
of
regard
,
she
raised
her
guitar
,
and
essayed
to
touch
the
chords
.
<EOS>
She
struck
a
few
notes
,
and
resumed
her
romance
:
<EOS>
Swift
that
stream
flows
on
,
<EOS>
Swift
the
night
is
wearing,—Yet
<EOS>
she
is
not
gone
,
Though
with
heart
despairing
.
<EOS>
Her
song
died
away
.
<EOS>
Her
hand
was
needed
to
brush
off
the
tears
that
were
gathering
in
her
large
dark
eyes
.
<EOS>
At
once
her
attitude
was
changed
.
<EOS>
The
hare
could
not
have
started
more
suddenly
from
her
form
.
<EOS>
She
heard
accents
well
known
concluding
the
melody
:
<EOS>
Dips
an
oar
-
plash
—
hark!—Gently
on
the
river;'Tis
her
lover
's
bark
.
<EOS>
On
the
Guadalquivir
.
<EOS>
Hark
!
<EOS>
a
song
she
hears!Every
note
she
snatches;As
<EOS>
the
singer
nears
,
<EOS>
Her
own
name
she
catches
.
<EOS>
Now
the
GitanillaStays
not
by
the
water
,
For
the
midnight
hourHath
her
lover
brought
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
lover
's
voice
.
<EOS>
She
caught
the
sound
at
once
,
and
,
starting
,
as
the
roe
would
arouse
herself
at
the
hunter
's
approach
,
bounded
down
the
crag
,
and
ere
he
had
finished
the
refrain
,
was
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
Flinging
the
bridle
to
Turpin
,
Luke
sprang
to
her
,
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
Disengaging
herself
from
his
ardent
embrace
,
Sybil
drew
back
,
abashed
at
the
sight
of
the
highwayman
.
<EOS>
"Heed
him
not
,
"
said
Luke
;
"
it
is
a
friend
.
<EOS>
""He
is
welcome
here
then
,
"
replied
Sybil
.
"
<EOS>
But
where
have
you
tarried
so
long
,
dear
Luke
?
"
<EOS>
continued
she
,
as
they
walked
to
a
little
distance
from
the
highwayman
.
<EOS>
"
What
hath
detained
you
?
<EOS>
The
hours
have
passed
wearily
since
you
departed
.
<EOS>
You
bring
good
news?""Good
news
,
my
girl
;
so
good
,
that
I
falter
even
in
the
telling
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
shall
know
all
anon
.
<EOS>
And
see
,
our
friend
yonder
grows
impatient
.
<EOS>
Are
there
any
stirring
?
<EOS>
We
must
bestow
a
meal
upon
him
,
and
that
forthwith
:
<EOS>
he
is
one
of
those
who
brook
not
much
delay
.
<EOS>
""I
came
not
to
spoil
a
love
meeting
,
"
said
Turpin
,
who
had
good
-
humoredly
witnessed
the
scene
;
"
but
,
in
sober
seriousness
,
if
there
is
a
stray
capon
to
be
met
with
in
the
land
of
Egypt
,
I
shall
be
glad
to
make
his
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Methinks
<EOS>
I
scent
a
stew
afar
off
.
<EOS>
""Follow
<EOS>
me
,
"
said
Sybil
;
"
your
wants
shall
be
supplied
.
<EOS>
""Stay
,
"
said
Luke
;
"
there
is
one
other
of
our
party
whose
coming
we
must
abide
.
<EOS>
""He
is
here
,
"
said
Sybil
,
observing
the
sexton
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
that
old
man?""My
grandsire
,
Peter
Bradley
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
that
Peter
Bradley
?
"
asked
Sybil
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
you
may
well
ask
whether
that
old
dried
-
up
otomy
,
who
ought
to
grin
in
a
glass
case
for
folks
to
stare
at
,
be
kith
and
kin
of
such
a
bang
-
up
cove
as
your
fancy
man
,
Luke
,
"
said
Turpin
,
laughing—"but
<EOS>
i
'
faith
<EOS>
he
is
.
<EOS>
""Though
<EOS>
he
is
your
grandsire
,
Luke
,
"
said
Sybil
,
"
I
like
him
not
.
<EOS>
His
glance
resembles
that
of
the
Evil
Eye
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
,
in
fact
,
the
look
which
Peter
fixed
upon
her
was
such
as
the
rattlesnake
casts
upon
its
victim
,
and
Sybil
felt
like
a
poor
fluttering
bird
under
the
fascination
of
that
venomous
reptile
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
remove
her
eyes
from
his
,
though
she
trembled
as
she
gazed
.
<EOS>
We
have
said
that
Peter
's
orbs
were
like
those
of
the
toad
.
<EOS>
Age
had
not
dimmed
their
brilliancy
.
<EOS>
In
his
harsh
features
you
could
only
read
bitter
scorn
or
withering
hate
;
but
in
his
eyes
resided
a
magnetic
influence
of
attraction
or
repulsion
.
<EOS>
Sybil
underwent
the
former
feeling
in
a
disagreeable
degree
.
<EOS>
She
was
drawn
to
him
as
by
the
motion
of
a
whirlpool
,
and
involuntarily
clung
to
her
lover
.
<EOS>
"It
is
the
Evil
Eye
,
dear
Luke
.
<EOS>
""Tut
<EOS>
,
tut
,
dear
Sybil
;
I
tell
you
it
is
my
grandsire
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
girl
says
rightly
,
however
,
"
rejoined
Turpin
;
"
Peter
has
a
confounded
ugly
look
about
the
ogles
,
and
stares
enough
to
put
a
modest
wench
out
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
my
old
earthworm
,
crawl
along
,
we
have
waited
for
you
long
enough
.
<EOS>
Is
this
the
first
time
you
have
seen
a
pretty
lass
,
eh?""It
is
the
first
time
I
have
seen
one
so
beautiful
,
"
said
Peter
;
"
and
I
crave
her
pardon
if
my
freedom
has
offended
her
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
not
at
your
enchantment
,
grandson
Luke
,
now
I
behold
the
object
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
one
piece
of
counsel
I
would
give
to
this
fair
maid
.
<EOS>
The
next
time
she
trusts
you
from
her
sight
,
I
would
advise
her
to
await
you
at
the
hill
-
top
,
otherwise
the
chances
are
shrewdly
against
your
reaching
the
ground
with
neck
unbroken
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
was
something
,
notwithstanding
the
satirical
manner
in
which
Peter
delivered
this
speech
,
calculated
to
make
a
more
favorable
impression
upon
Sybil
than
his
previous
conduct
had
inspired
her
with
;
and
,
having
ascertained
from
Luke
to
what
his
speech
referred
,
she
extended
her
hand
to
him
,
yet
not
without
a
shudder
,
as
it
was
enclosed
in
his
skinny
grasp
.
<EOS>
It
was
like
the
fingers
of
Venus
in
the
grasp
of
a
skeleton
.
<EOS>
"This
is
a
little
hand
,
"
said
Peter
,
"
and
I
have
some
skill
myself
in
palmistry
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
peruse
its
lines?""Not
now
,
in
the
devil
's
name
!
"
<EOS>
said
Turpin
,
stamping
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
Old
Ruffin
himself
amongst
us
presently
,
if
Peter
Bradley
grows
gallant
.
<EOS>
"Leading
<EOS>
their
horses
,
the
party
took
their
way
through
the
trees
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
'
walking
brought
them
in
sight
of
the
gipsy
encampment
,
the
spot
selected
for
which
might
be
termed
the
Eden
of
the
valley
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
small
green
plain
,
smooth
as
a
well
-
shorn
lawn
,
kept
ever
verdant
—
save
in
the
spots
where
the
frequent
fires
had
scorched
its
surface
—
by
the
flowing
stream
that
rushed
past
it
,
and
surrounded
by
an
amphitheatre
of
wooded
hills
.
<EOS>
Here
might
be
seen
the
canvas
tent
with
its
patches
of
varied
coloring
;
the
rude
-
fashioned
hut
of
primitive
construction
;
the
kettle
slungBetween
two
poles
,
upon
a
stick
transverse;the
tethered
beasts
of
burden
,
the
horses
,
asses
,
dogs
,
carts
,
caravans
,
wains
,
blocks
,
and
other
movables
and
immovables
belonging
to
the
wandering
tribe
.
<EOS>
Glimmering
through
the
trees
,
at
the
extremity
of
the
plain
,
appeared
the
ivy
-
mantled
walls
of
Davenham
Priory
.
<EOS>
Though
much
had
gone
to
decay
,
enough
remained
to
recall
the
pristine
state
of
this
once
majestic
pile
,
and
the
long
,
though
broken
line
of
Saxon
arches
,
that
still
marked
the
cloister
wall
;
the
piers
that
yet
supported
the
dormitory
;
the
enormous
horse
-
shoe
arch
that
spanned
the
court
;
and
,
above
all
,
the
great
marigold
,
or
circular
window
,
which
terminated
the
chapel
,
and
which
,
though
now
despoiled
of
its
painted
honors
,
retained
,
like
the
skeleton
leaf
,
its
fibrous
intricacies
entire,—all
eloquently
spoke
of
the
glories
of
the
past
,
while
they
awakened
reverence
and
admiration
for
the
still
enduring
beauty
of
the
present
.
<EOS>
Towards
these
ruins
Sybil
conducted
the
party
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
dwell
therein
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Peter
,
pointing
towards
the
priory
.
<EOS>
"That
is
my
dwelling
,
"
said
Sybil
.
<EOS>
"It
is
one
I
should
covet
more
than
a
modern
mansion
,
"
returned
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"I
love
those
old
walls
better
than
any
house
that
was
ever
fashioned
,
"
replied
Sybil
.
<EOS>
As
they
entered
the
Prior
's
Close
,
as
it
was
called
,
several
swarthy
figures
made
their
appearance
from
the
tents
.
<EOS>
Many
a
greeting
was
bestowed
upon
Luke
,
in
the
wild
jargon
of
the
tribe
.
<EOS>
At
length
an
uncouth
dwarfish
figure
,
with
a
shock
head
of
black
hair
,
hopped
towards
them
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
acknowledge
Luke
as
his
master
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
Grasshopper
,
"
said
Luke
,
"
take
these
horses
,
and
see
that
they
lack
neither
dressing
nor
provender
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
hark
ye
,
Grasshopper
,
"
added
Turpin
;
"
I
give
you
a
special
charge
about
this
mare
.
<EOS>
Neither
dress
nor
feed
her
till
I
see
both
done
myself
.
<EOS>
Just
walk
her
for
ten
minutes
,
and
if
you
have
a
glass
of
ale
in
the
place
,
let
her
sip
it
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
bidding
shall
be
done
,
"
chirped
the
human
insect
,
as
he
fluttered
away
with
his
charges
.
<EOS>
A
motley
assemblage
of
tawny
-
skinned
varlets
,
dark
-
eyed
women
and
children
,
whose
dusky
limbs
betrayed
their
lineage
,
in
strange
costume
,
and
of
wild
deportment
,
checked
the
path
,
muttering
welcome
upon
welcome
into
the
ear
of
Luke
as
he
passed
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
evident
he
was
in
no
mood
for
converse
,
Sybil
,
who
seemed
to
exercise
considerable
authority
over
the
crew
,
with
a
word
dispersed
them
,
and
they
herded
back
to
their
respective
habitations
.
<EOS>
A
low
door
admitted
Luke
and
his
companions
into
what
had
once
been
the
garden
,
in
which
some
old
moss
-
encrusted
apple
and
walnut
-
trees
were
still
standing
,
bearing
a
look
of
antiquity
almost
as
venerable
as
that
of
the
adjoining
fabric
.
<EOS>
Another
open
door
gave
them
entrance
to
a
spacious
chamber
,
formerly
the
eating
-
room
or
refectory
of
the
holy
brotherhood
,
and
a
goodly
room
it
had
been
,
though
now
its
slender
lanceolated
windows
were
stuffed
with
hay
to
keep
out
the
air
.
<EOS>
Large
holes
told
where
huge
oaken
rafters
had
once
crossed
the
roof
,
and
a
yawning
aperture
marked
the
place
where
a
cheering
fire
had
formerly
blazed
.
<EOS>
As
regarded
this
latter
spot
,
the
good
old
custom
was
not
,
even
now
,
totally
abrogated
.
<EOS>
An
iron
plate
,
covered
with
crackling
wood
,
sustained
a
ponderous
black
caldron
,
the
rich
steam
from
which
gratefully
affected
the
olfactory
organs
of
the
highwayman
.
<EOS>
"That
augurs
well
,
"
said
he
,
rubbing
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"Still
<EOS>
hungering
after
the
fleshpots
of
Egypt
,
"
said
the
sexton
,
with
a
ghastly
smile
.
<EOS>
"We
will
see
what
that
kettle
contains
,
"
said
Luke
.
<EOS>
"Handassah
—
Grace
!
"
exclaimed
Sybil
,
calling
.
<EOS>
Her
summons
was
answered
by
two
maidens
,
habited
not
unbecomingly
,
in
gipsy
gear
.
<EOS>
"Bring
<EOS>
the
best
our
larder
can
furnish
,
"
said
Sybil
,
"
and
use
despatch
.
<EOS>
You
have
appetites
to
provide
for
,
sharpened
by
a
long
ride
in
the
open
air

<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
by
a
night
's
fasting
,
"
said
Luke
,
"
and
solitary
confinement
to
boot
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
a
night
of
business
,
"
added
Turpin—"and
plaguy
perplexing
business
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
the
night
of
a
funeral
too
,
"
doled
Peter
;
"
and
that
funeral
a
father
's
.
<EOS>
Let
us
have
breakfast
speedily
,
by
all
means
.
<EOS>
We
have
rare
appetites
.
<EOS>
"An
<EOS>
old
oaken
table
<EOS>
—
it
might
have
been
the
self
-
same
upon
which
the
holy
friars
had
broken
their
morning
fast
—
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
ample
board
soon
groaned
beneath
the
weight
of
the
savory
caldron
,
the
unctuous
contents
of
which
proved
to
be
a
couple
of
dismembered
pheasants
,
an
equal
proportion
of
poultry
,
great
gouts
of
ham
,
mushrooms
,
onions
,
and
other
piquant
condiments
,
so
satisfactory
to
Dick
Turpin
,
that
,
upon
tasting
a
mouthful
,
he
absolutely
shed
tears
of
delight
.
<EOS>
The
dish
was
indeed
the
triumph
of
gipsy
cookery
;
and
so
sedulously
did
Dick
apply
himself
to
his
mess
,
and
so
complete
was
his
abstraction
,
that
he
perceived
not
he
was
left
alone
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
when
about
to
wash
down
the
last
drumstick
of
the
last
fowl
with
a
can
of
excellent
ale
that
he
made
this
discovery
.
<EOS>
"What
!
<EOS>
all
gone
?
<EOS>
And
Peter
Bradley
,
too
?
<EOS>
What
the
devil
does
this
mean
?
<EOS>
"
mused
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
muddle
my
brain
with
any
more
Pharaoh
,
though
I
have
feasted
like
a
king
of
Egypt
.
<EOS>
That
will
never
do
.
<EOS>
Caution
,
Dick
,
caution
.
<EOS>
Suppose
I
shift
yon
brick
from
the
wall
,
and
place
this
precious
document
beneath
it
.
<EOS>
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
Luke
would
never
play
me
false
.
<EOS>
And
now
for
Bess
!
<EOS>
Bless
her
black
skin
!
<EOS>
she
'll
wonder
where
I
've
been
so
long
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
my
way
to
leave
her
to
shift
for
herself
,
though
she
can
do
that
on
a
pinch
.
"Soliloquizing
<EOS>
thus
,
he
arose
and
walked
towards
the
door
.

IllustrationBENEATH
a
moldering
wall
,
whither
they
had
strayed
,
to
be
free
from
interruption
,
and
upon
a
carpet
of
the
greenest
moss
,
sat
Sybil
and
her
lover
.
<EOS>
With
eager
curiosity
she
listened
to
his
tale
.
<EOS>
He
recounted
all
that
had
befallen
him
since
his
departure
.
<EOS>
He
told
her
of
the
awful
revelations
of
the
tomb
;
of
the
ring
that
,
like
a
talisman
,
had
conjured
up
a
thousand
brilliant
prospects
;
of
his
subsequent
perils
;
his
escapes
;
his
rencontre
with
Lady
Rookwood
;
his
visit
to
his
father
's
body
;
and
his
meeting
with
his
brother
.
<EOS>
All
this
she
heard
with
a
cheek
now
flushed
with
expectation
,
now
made
pale
with
apprehension
;
with
palpitating
bosom
,
and
suppressed
breath
.
<EOS>
But
when
taking
a
softer
tone
,
love
,
affection
,
happiness
inspired
the
theme
,
and
Luke
sought
to
paint
the
bliss
that
should
be
theirs
in
his
new
estate
;
when
he
would
throw
his
fortune
into
her
lap
,
his
titles
at
her
feet
,
and
bid
her
wear
them
with
him
;
when
,
with
ennobled
hand
and
unchanged
heart
,
he
would
fulfil
the
troth
plighted
in
his
outcast
days
;
in
lieu
of
tender
,
grateful
acquiescence
,
the
features
of
Sybil
became
overcast
,
the
soft
smile
faded
away
,
and
,
as
spring
sunshine
is
succeeded
by
the
sudden
shower
,
the
light
that
dwelt
in
her
sunny
orbs
grew
dim
with
tears
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
—
why
is
this
,
dear
Sybil
?
"
said
Luke
,
gazing
upon
her
in
astonishment
,
not
unmingled
with
displeasure
.
<EOS>
"
To
what
am
I
to
attribute
these
tears
?
<EOS>
You
do
not
,
surely
,
regret
my
good
fortune?""Not
on
your
own
account
,
dear
Luke
,
"
returned
she
,
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
The
tears
I
shed
were
for
myself
—
the
first
,
the
only
tears
that
I
have
ever
shed
for
such
cause
;
and
,
"
added
she
,
raising
her
head
like
a
flower
surcharged
with
moisture
,
"
they
shall
be
the
last
.
<EOS>
""This
is
inexplicable
,
dear
Sybil

<EOS>
Why
should
you
lament
for
yourself
,
if
not
for
me

<EOS>
Does
not
the
sunshine
of
prosperity
that
now
shines
upon
me
gild
you
with
the
same
beam
?
<EOS>
Did
I
not
even
now
affirm
that
the
day
that
saw
me
enter
the
hall
of
my
forefathers
should
dawn
upon
our
espousals?""True
;
but
the
sun
that
shines
upon
you

wears
a
threatening
aspect

The
day

those
espousals
will
never
dawn

<EOS>
You
can
not
make
me
the
Lady
of
Rookwood

<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
do
I
hear
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Luke
,
surprised
at
this
avowal
of
his
mistress
,
sadly
and
deliberately
delivered
.
"
<EOS>
Not
we
d
you

<EOS>
And
wherefore
not

<EOS>
Is
it
the
rank
I
have
acquired
,
or
hope
to
acquire
,
that
displeases
you
?
<EOS>
Speak
,
that
I
may
waste
no
further
time
in
thus
pursuing
the
shadows
of
happiness

reality
fleets
from
me

<EOS>
""And

they
shadows

this
the
reality

dear
Luke

<EOS>
Question
your
secret
soul

you
will
find
it
otherwise

<EOS>
You
could
not
forego
your
triumph
;
it
is
not
likely

<EOS>
You
have
dwelt
too
much
upon
the
proud
title
which
will
be
yours
to
yield
it
to
another

when
it
may
be
won
so
easily

And
,
above
all
,
when
your
mother
's
reputation
,
and
your
own
stained
name
,
may
be
cleared
by
one
word
,
breathed
aloud
,
would
you
fail
to
utter
it
?
<EOS>
No

dear
Luke

I
read
your
heart
;
you
would
not

<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
if
I
could
not
forego
this
,
wherefore
is
it
that
you
refuse
to
be
a
sharer
in
my
triumph

<EOS>
Why

you
render
my
honors
valueless

,
how
joyfully!—have
been
your
bride
.
<EOS>
As
Sir
Luke
Rookwood"—and
she
shuddered
as
she
pronounced
the
name—"I
never
can
be
so
.
<EOS>
""Then
,
by
Heaven
!
<EOS>
Luke
Bradley
will
I
remain
.
<EOS>
But
wherefore
—
wherefore
not
as
Sir
Luke
Rookwood?""Because
,
"
replied
Sybil
,
with
reluctance—"because
<EOS>
I
am
no
longer
your
equal
.
<EOS>
The
gipsy
's
low
-
born
daughter
is
no
mate
for
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
Love
can
not
blind
me
,
dear
Luke
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
make
me
other
than
I
am
;
it
can
not
exalt
me
in
my
own
esteem
,
nor
in
that
of
the
world
,
<EOS>
with
which
you
,
alas
!
<EOS>
too
soon
will
mingle
,
and
which
will
regard
even
me
as
—
no
matter
what!—it
shall
not
scorn
me
as
your
bride
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
bring
shame
and
reproach
upon
you
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
for
me
,
dear
Luke
,
the
proud
ones
of
the
earth
were
to
treat
you
with
contumely
,
this
heart
would
break
with
agony
.
<EOS>
For
myself
,
I
have
pride
sufficient
—
perchance
too
much
.
<EOS>
Perchance
'
tis
pride
that
actuates
me
now
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
But
for
you
I
am
all
weakness
.
<EOS>
As
you
were
heretofore
,
I
would
have
been
to
you
the
tenderest
and
truest
wife
that
ever
breathed
;
as
you
are
now——""Hear
me
,
Sybil
.
<EOS>
""Hear
me
out
,
dear
Luke
.
<EOS>
One
other
motive
there
is
that
determines
my
present
conduct
,
which
,
were
all
else
surmounted
,
would
in
itself
suffice
.
<EOS>
Ask
me
not
what
that
is
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
explain
it
.
<EOS>
For
your
own
sake
;
I
implore
you
,
be
satisfied
with
my
refusal
.
<EOS>
""What
a
destiny
is
mine
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Luke
,
striking
his
forehead
with
his
clenched
hand
.
<EOS>
"
No
choice
is
left
me
.
<EOS>
Either
way
I
destroy
my
own
happiness
.
<EOS>
On
the
one
hand
stands
love
—
on
the
other
,
ambition
;
yet
neither
will
conjoin
.
<EOS>
""Pursue
,
then
,
ambition
,
"
said
Sybil
,
energetically
,
"
if
you
can
hesitate
.
<EOS>
Forget
that
I
have
ever
existed
;
forget
you
have
ever
loved
;
forget
that
such
a
passion
dwells
within
the
human
heart
,
and
you
may
still
be
happy
,
though
you
are
great
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
do
you
deem
,
"
replied
Luke
,
with
frantic
impatience
,
"
that
I
can
accomplish
this
;
that
I
can
forget
that
I
have
loved
you
;
that
I
can
forget
you
?
<EOS>
Cost
what
it
will
,
the
effort
shall
be
made
.
<EOS>
Yet
by
our
former
love
,
I
charge
you
tell
me
what
has
wrought
this
change
in
you
!
<EOS>
Why
do
you
now
refuse
me?""I
have
said
you
are
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
,
"
returned
Sybil
,
with
painful
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
Does
that
name
import
nothing?""Imports
it
aught
of
ill?""To
me
,
everything
of
ill
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
fated
house
.
<EOS>
Its
line
are
all
predestined
.
<EOS>
""To
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Luke
.
<EOS>
"To
murder
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Sybil
,
with
solemn
emphasis
.
<EOS>
"
To
the
murder
of
their
wives
.
<EOS>
Forgive
me
,
Luke
,
if
I
have
dared
to
utter
this
.
<EOS>
Yourself
compelled
me
to
it
.
<EOS>
"Amazement
<EOS>
,
horror
,
wrath
,
kept
Luke
silent
for
a
few
moments
.
<EOS>
Starting
to
his
feet
,
he
cried:"And
can
you
suspect
me
of
a
crime
so
foul
?
<EOS>
Think
you
,
because
I
shall
assume
the
name
,
that
I
shall
put
on
the
nature
likewise
of
my
race
?
<EOS>
Do
you
believe
me
capable
of
aught
<EOS>
so
horrible?""Oh
,
<EOS>
no
,
I
believe
it
not
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
would
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
Your
soul
would
reject
with
horror
such
a
deed
.
<EOS>
But
if
Fate
should
guide
your
hand
,
if
the
avenging
spirit
of
your
murdered
ancestress
should
point
to
the
steel
,
you
could
not
shun
it
then
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
Heaven
's
name
!
<EOS>
to
what
do
you
allude?""To
a
tradition
of
your
house
,
"
replied
Sybil
.
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
me
,
and
you
shall
hear
the
legend
.
"
<EOS>
And
with
a
pathos
that
produced
a
thrilling
effect
upon
Luke
,
she
sang
the
following
ballad
:
<EOS>
THE
LEGEND
OF
THE
LADY
OF
ROOKWOODGrim
Ranulph
home
hath
at
midnight
come
,
from
the
long
wars
of
the
Roses
,
And
the
squire
,
who
waits
at
his
ancient
gates
,
a
secret
dark
discloses;To
<EOS>
that
varlet
's
words
<EOS>
no
response
accords
his
lord
,
but
his
visage
sternGrows
ghastly
white
in
the
wan
moonlight
,
and
his
eyes
like
the
lean
wolf
's
burn
.
<EOS>
To
his
lady
's
bower
,
at
that
lonesome
hour
,
unannounced
,
is
Sir
Ranulph
<EOS>
gone;Through
the
dim
corridor
,
through
the
hidden
door
<EOS>
,
he
glides
—
she
is
all
alone!Full
of
holy
zeal
doth
<EOS>
his
young
dame
kneel
at
the
meek
<EOS>
Madonna
's
feet
,
Her
hands
are
pressed
on
her
gentle
breast
,
and
upturned
is
her
aspect
sweet
.
<EOS>
Beats
Ranulph
's
heart
with
a
joyful
start
,
as
he
looks
on
her
guiltless
face;And
the
raging
fire
of
his
jealous
ire
is
subdued
by
the
words
of
grace;His
own
name
shares
her
murmured
prayers
—
more
freely
<EOS>
can
he
breathe;But
ah
!
<EOS>
that
look
!
<EOS>
Why
doth
he
pluck
his
poniard
from
its
sheath?On
a
footstool
thrown
,
lies
a
costly
gown
of
saye
and
of
minevere
—
<EOS>
A
mantle
fair
for
the
dainty
wear
of
a
migniard
cavalier,—And
<EOS>
on
it
flung
,
to
a
bracelet
hung
,
a
picture
meets
his
eye;"By
my
father
's
head
!
"
<EOS>
grim
Ranulph
said
,
"
false
wife
,
thy
end
draws
nigh
.
<EOS>
"From
off
its
chain
hath
<EOS>
the
fierce
knight
ta'en
<EOS>
that
fond
and
fatal
<EOS>
pledge;His
dark
eyes
blaze
,
no

says
,
thrice
gleams
his
dagger
's
edge!Her
blood
<EOS>
it
drinks
,
and
,
<EOS>
as
she
sinks
,
his
victim
hears
his
cry:"For

impure
of
paramour
,
adult'ress
,
dost
thou
die!"Silent
<EOS>
he
stood
,
with
hands
embrued
in
gore
,
and
glance
of
flame
,
As
thus
her
plaint
,
in
accents
faint
,
made
his
ill
-
fated
dame:"Kind
Heaven

<EOS>
"I've

,
through
doubt

I
've
loved
thee

my
love

my
paramour

he
was
my

Red
,
Red
Rose
,
on

glows
,
on
his
pennon
gleams
the
White
,
And
the
bitter
feud
,
that
ye
both
have
rued
,
forbids
ye
to
unite

<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
bower
he
sought
<EOS>
,
what
time
he
thought
thy
jealous
vassals
slept
,
Of
joy
we
dreamed
,
and
never
deemed
that
watch
those
vassals
kept;An
hour
flew
by
,
too
speedily!—that
picture
was
his
boon
:
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
little
thrift
to
me

worth

<EOS>
dark

united

For
my

's
firm
truth
,
'
mid
tears
and
ruth
,
with
death
hast
thou
requited
:
<EOS>
In
prayer
sincere

full

a

of
my
wretched
life
<EOS>
I
've
spent;But
to
hell
's
control
<EOS>
would
I
give
my
soul
to
work
thy
<EOS>
chastisement!"These
wild
words
said
,
low
drooped
her
head
,
and
Ranulph
's
life
-
blood
froze
,
For
the
earth
did
gape
,
as
an
awful
shape
from
out
its
depths
<EOS>
arose:"Thy
prayer
is
heard

Hell

concurred

cried
the
fiend
,
"
thy

that

And
another

weeping

<EOS>
This

declines
—

fades
,
like

away;Her

woos
—

is
her
Wedding
Day!"And
<EOS>
this
is
the
legend
of
my
ancestress

"
said
Luke
,
as
Sybil
's
strains
were
ended
.
<EOS>
"It
is
,
"
replied
she
.
<EOS>
"An
<EOS>
idle
tale
,
"
observed
Luke
,
moodily
.
"Not
<EOS>
so
,
"
answered
Sybil
.
"
<EOS>
Has
not
the
curse
of
blood
clung
to
all
your
line
?
<EOS>
Has
it
not
attached
to
your
father
—
to
Sir
Reginald
—
<EOS>
Sir
Ralph
—
Sir
Ranulph
—
to
all
?
<EOS>
Which
of
them
has
escaped
it
?
<EOS>
And
when
I
tell
you
this
,
dear
Luke
;
when
I
find
you
bear
the
name
of
this
accursed
race
,
can
you
wonder
if
I
shudder
at
adding
to
the
list
of
the
victims
of
that
ruthless
spirit
,
and
that
I
tremble
for
you
?
<EOS>
I
would
die
for
you
willingly
—
but
not
by
your
hand
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
that
my
blood
,
which
I
would
now
pour
out
for
you
as
freely
as
water
,
should
rise
up
in
judgment
against
you
.
<EOS>
For
myself
I
have
no
tears
—
for
you
,
a
thousand
.
<EOS>
My
mother
,
upon
her
death
-
bed
,
told
me
I
should
never
be
yours
.
<EOS>
I
believed
her
<EOS>
not
,
for
I
was
happy
then
.
<EOS>
She
said
that
we
never
should
be
united
;
or
,
if
united——?""What
,
in
Heaven
's
name?""That
<EOS>
you
would
be
my
destroyer

<EOS>
How
could
I
credit
her
words
then
?
<EOS>
How
can
I
doubt
them
now
,
when
I
find
you
are
a
Rookwood
?
<EOS>
And
think
not
,
dear
Luke
,
that
I
am
ruled
by
selfish
fears
in
this
resolution
.
<EOS>
To
renounce
you
may
cost
me
my
life
;
but
the
deed
will
be
my
own
.
<EOS>
You
may
call
me
superstitious
,
credulous
:
I
have
been
nurtured
in
credulity
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
faith
of
my
fathers
.
<EOS>
There
are
those
,
methinks
,
who
have
an
insight
into
futurity
;
and
such
boding
words
have
been
spoken
,
that
,
be
they
true
or
false
,
I
will
not
risk
their
fulfilment
in
my
person

<EOS>
I
may
be
credulous
;
I
may
be
weak
;
I
may
be
erring
;
but
I
am
steadfast
in
this
.
<EOS>
Bid
me
perish
at
your
feet
,
and
I
will
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
your
Fate
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
the
wretched
instrument
of
your
perdition
.
<EOS>
I
will
love
,
worship
,
watch
,
serve
,
perish
for
you
—
but
I
'll
not
we
d
you
.
"Exhausted
<EOS>
by
the
vehemence
of
her
emotion
,
she
would
have
sunk
upon
the
ground
,
had
not
Luke
caught
her
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
Pressing
her
to
his
bosom
,
he
renewed
his
passionate
protestations
.
<EOS>
Every
argument
was
unavailing
.
<EOS>
Sybil
appeared
inflexible

<EOS>
"You
<EOS>

<EOS>
said
she
,
at
length

<EOS>
"A

fervently

replied
Luke
;
"
put
it
to
the
test

<EOS>
""How
<EOS>

I
dare

<EOS>
Consider
well

<EOS>
""Name

a

behind
them

<EOS>
"
Do
not

<EOS>
And
immediately
afterwards
the
sexton
made
his
appearance

<EOS>
There
was
a
malignant
smile
upon
his
countenance

<EOS>
The
lovers
started
at
the
ominous
interruption

"Begone
!

<EOS>
cried
Luke
.
<EOS>
"Take
<EOS>
not

said
Peter
,
"

I
leave

hither

<EOS>
""What
counsel
did
he
give
you

Luke

<EOS>
inquired
Sybil
,
eagerly
,
of
her
lover

<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
spoke
of
you

fond
girl

replied
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
I
cautioned
him
against
the
match

<EOS>
I
knew
not
your

I

spared

<EOS>
You

judged
wisely

Were

""MUST

cried
Sybil
,
her
eyes
absolutely
emitting
sparkles
of
indignation
from
their
night

like
depths
;
and
,
unsheathing
<EOS>
as
she
spoke
the
short
poniard
which
she
wore
at
her
girdle
,
she
rushed
towards
Peter
,
raising
her
hand
to
strike
.
<EOS>
"Must

<EOS>
And
dare
you

this?""Put
up

Peter

calmly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Had
I
been
younger

your
eyes
might
have
had
more
terrors
for
me

your
weapon

as
it
is
,
I
am
proof
against
both

<EOS>
You
would
not
strike
an
old
man

myself

kin?"Sybil
's
uplifted
hand
fell
to
her
side
.
<EOS>
"'Tis
<EOS>
true
,
"
continued
the
sexton
,
"
I
dared
to
give
him
this
advice
;

when
you
have
heard
me
out

you

it
<EOS>
;
I
overheard
you
by
accident
.
<EOS>
I
applaud
your
resolution
;
but
if
you
are
inclined
to
sacrifice
all
for
your
lover
's
weal
,
do
not
let
the
work
be
incomplete
.
<EOS>
Bind
him
not
by
oaths
which
he
will
regard
as
spiders
'
webs
,
to
be
burst
through
at
pleasure
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
as
well
as
I
do
,
that
he
is
bent
on
being
lord
of
Rookwood
;
and
,
in
truth
,
to
an
aspiring
mind
,
such
a
desire
is
natural
,
is
praiseworthy
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
pleasant
,
as
well
as
honorable
,
to
efface
the
stain
cast
upon
his
birth
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
an
act
of
filial
duty
in
him
to
restore
his
mother
's
good
name
;
and
I
,
her
father
,
laud
his
anxiety
on
that
score
;
though
,
to
speak
truth
,
fair
maid
,
I
am
not
so
rigid
as
your
nice
moralists
in
my
view
of
human
nature
,
and
can
allow
a
latitude
to
love
which
their
nicer
scruples
will
not
admit
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
proud
thing
to
triumph
over
his
implacable
foe
;
and
this
he
may
accomplish——""Without
marriage
,
"
interrupted
Sybil
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"True
,
"
returned
Peter
;
"
yet
not
maintain
it
.
<EOS>
May
win
it
,
but
not
wear
it
.
<EOS>
You
have
said
truly
,
the
house
of
Rookwood
is
a
fated
house
;
and
it
hath
been
said
likewise
,
that
if
he
we
d
not
one
of
his
own
kindred
—
that
if
Rook
mate
not
with
Rook
,
his
possessions
shall
pass
away
from
his
hands
.
<EOS>
Listen
to
this
prophetic
quatrain
:
When
the
stray
Rook
shall
perch
on
the
topmost
bough
,
There
shall
be
clamor
and
screeching
,
I
trow;But
of
right
to
,
and
rule
of
the
ancient
nest
,
The
Rook
that
with
Rook
mates
shall
hold
him
possest
.
<EOS>
"You
hear
what
these
quaint
rhymes
say
.
<EOS>
Luke
is
,
doubtless
,
the
stray
rook
,
and
a
fledgeling
hath
flown
hither
from
a
distant
country
.
<EOS>
He
must
take
her
to
his
mate
,
or
relinquish
her
<EOS>
and
'
the
ancient
nest
'
to
his
brother
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
disregard
such
sayings
.
<EOS>
I
have
little
faith
in
prophecy
and
divination
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
Eleanor
Mowbray
,
for
so
she
is
called
,
can
have
to
do
with
the
tenure
of
the
estates
of
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
But
if
Luke
Rookwood
,
after
he
has
lorded
it
for
awhile
in
splendor
,
be
cast
forth
again
in
rags
and
wretchedness
,
let
him
not
blame
his
grandsire
for
his
own
want
of
caution
.
<EOS>
""Luke
,
I
implore
you
,
tell
me
,
"
said
Sybil
,
who
had
listened
,
horror
-
stricken
,
to
the
sexton
,
shuddering
,
as
it
were
,
beneath
the
chilly
influence
of
his
malevolent
glance
,
"
is
this
true
?
<EOS>
Does
your
fate
depend
upon
Eleanor
Mowbray
?
<EOS>
Who
is
she
?
<EOS>
What
has
she
to
do
with
Rookwood
?
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
her
?
<EOS>
Do
you
love
her?""I
have
never
seen
her
,
"
replied
Luke
.
<EOS>
"Thank
<EOS>
Heaven
for
that
!
"
cried
Sybil
.
<EOS>
"
Then
you
love
her
not?""How
were
that
possible
?
"
returned
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
Do
I
not
say
I
have
not
seen
her?""Who
<EOS>
is
she
<EOS>
,
then?""This
old
man
tells
me
she
is
my
cousin
.
<EOS>
She
is
betrothed
to
my
brother
Ranulph
.
""How
?
"
ejaculated
Sybil
.
"
<EOS>
And
would
you
snatch
his
betrothed
from
your
brother
's
arms
?
<EOS>
Would
you
do
him
this
grievous
wrong
?
<EOS>
Is
it
not
enough
that
you
must
wrest
from
him
that
which
he
has
long
deemed
his
own
?
<EOS>
And
if
he
has
falsely
deemed
it
so
,
it
will
not
make
his
loss
the
less
bitter
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
thus
wrong
your
brother
,
do
not
look
for
happiness
;
do
not
look
for
respect
;
for
neither
will
be
your
portion
.
<EOS>
Even
this
stony
-
hearted
old
man
shrinks
aghast
at
such
a
deed
.
<EOS>
His
snake
-
like
eyes
are
buried
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
See
,
I
have
moved
even
him
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
in
truth
Peter
did
appear
,
for
an
instant
,
strangely
moved
.
<EOS>
"'Tis
<EOS>
nothing
,
"
returned
he
,
mastering
his
emotion
by
a
strong
effort
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
all
this
to
me
?
<EOS>
I
never
had
a
brother
.
<EOS>
I
never
had
aught
—
wife
,
child
,
or
relative
,
that
loved
me
.
<EOS>
And
I
love
not
the
world
,
nor
the
things
of
the
world
,
nor
those
that
inhabit
the
world
.
<EOS>
But
I
know
what
sways
the
world
and
its
inhabitants
;
and
that
is
,
SELF
!
<EOS>
AND
SELF
-
INTEREST
!
<EOS>
Let
Luke
reflect
on
this
.
<EOS>
The
key
to
Rookwood
is
Eleanor
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
The
hand
that
grasps
hers
,
grasps
those
lands
;
thus
saith
the
prophecy
.
<EOS>
""It
is
a
lying
prophecy
.
<EOS>
""It
was
uttered
by
one
of
your
race
.
<EOS>
""By
<EOS>
whom?""By
<EOS>
Barbara
Lovel
,
"
said
Peter
,
with
a
sneer
of
triumph
.
<EOS>
"Ha!""Heed
<EOS>
him
not
,
"
exclaimed
Luke
,
as
Sybil
recoiled
at
this
intelligence
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
yours
.
<EOS>
""Not
mine
!
<EOS>
not
mine
!
"
<EOS>
shrieked
she
;
"
but
,
oh
!
not
hers!""Whither
go
you
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Luke
,
as
Sybil
,
half
bewildered
,
tore
herself
from
him
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
Barbara
Lovel
.
<EOS>
""I
will
go
with
you
.
<EOS>
""No
!
<EOS>
let
me
go
alone
.
<EOS>
I
have
much
to
ask
her
;
yet
tarry
not
with
this
old
man
,
dear
Luke
,
or
close
your
ears
to
his
crafty
talk
.
<EOS>
Avoid
him
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
am
sick
at
heart
.
<EOS>
Follow
me
not
<EOS>
;
I
implore
you
,
follow
me
not
.
"And
<EOS>
with
distracted
air
she
darted
amongst
the
mouldering
cloisters
,
leaving
Luke
stupefied
with
anguish
and
surprise
.
<EOS>
The
sexton
maintained
a
stern
and
stoical
composure
.
<EOS>
"She
<EOS>
is
a
woman
<EOS>
,
after
all
,
"
muttered
he
;
"
all
her
high
-
flown
resolves
melt
like
snow
in
the
sunshine
at
the
thought
of
a
rival
.
<EOS>
I
congratulate
you
,
grandson
Luke
;
you
are
free
from
your
fetters
.
<EOS>
""Free
!
"
echoed
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quit
my
sight
;
I
loathe
to
look
upon
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
broken
the
truest
heart
that
ever
beat
in
woman
's
bosom
.
<EOS>
""Tut
,
tut
,
"
returned
Peter
;
"
it
is
not
broken
yet
.
<EOS>
Wait
till
we
hear
what
old
Barbara
has
got
to
say
;
and
,
meanwhile
,
we
must
arrange
with
Dick
Turpin
the
price
of
that
certificate
.
<EOS>
The
knave
knows
its
value
well
.
<EOS>
Come
,
be
a
man
.
<EOS>
This
is
worse
than
womanish
.
"And
<EOS>
at
length
he
succeeded
,
half
by
force
and
half
by
persuasion
,
in
dragging
Luke
away
with
him
.

Discurso

.
<EOS>
LIKE
a
dove
escaped
from
the
talons
of
the
falcon
,
Sybil
fled
from
the
clutches
of
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
Her
brain
was
in
a
whirl
,
her
blood
on
fire
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
distinct
perception
of
external
objects
;
no
definite
notion
of
what
she
herself
was
about
to
do
,
and
glided
more
like
a
flitting
spirit
than
a
living
woman
along
the
ruined
ambulatory
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
had
fallen
in
disorder
over
her
face
.
<EOS>
She
stayed
not
to
adjust
it
,
but
tossed
aside
the
blinding
locks
with
frantic
impatience
.
<EOS>
She
felt
as
one
may
feel
who
tries
to
strain
his
nerves
,
shattered
by
illness
,
to
the
endurance
of
some
dreadful
,
yet
necessary
pain
.
<EOS>
Sybil
loved
her
granddame
,
old
Barbara
;
but
it
was
with
a
love
tempered
by
fear
.
<EOS>
Barbara
was
not
a
person
to
inspire
esteem
or
to
claim
affection
.
<EOS>
She
was
regarded
by
the
wild
tribe
which
she
ruled
as
their
queen
-
elect
,
with
some
such
feeling
of
inexplicable
awe
as
is
entertained
by
the
African
slave
for
the
Obeah
woman
.
<EOS>
They
acknowledged
her
power
,
unhesitatingly
obeyed
her
commands
,
and
shrank
with
terror
from
her
anathema
,
which
was
indeed
seldom
pronounced
;
but
when
uttered
,
was
considered
as
doom
.
<EOS>
Her
tribe
she
looked
upon
as
her
flock
,
and
stretched
her
maternal
hand
over
all
,
ready
alike
to
cherish
or
chastise
;
and
having
already
survived
a
generation
,
that
which
succeeded
,
having
from
infancy
imbibed
a
superstitious
veneration
for
the
"
cunning
woman
,
"
as
she
was
called
,
the
sentiment
could
never
be
wholly
effaced
.
<EOS>
Winding
her
way
,
she
knew
not
how
,
through
roofless
halls
,
over
disjointed
fragments
of
fallen
pillars
,
Sybil
reached
a
flight
of
steps
.
<EOS>
A
door
,
studded
with
iron
nails
,
stayed
her
progress
;
it
was
an
old
,
strong
oaken
frame
,
surmounted
by
a
Gothic
arch
,
in
the
keystone
of
which
leered
one
of
those
grotesque
demoniacal
faces
with
which
the
fathers
of
the
church
delighted
to
adorn
their
shrines
.
<EOS>
Sybil
looked
up
—
her
glance
encountered
the
fantastical
visage
.
<EOS>
It
recalled
the
features
of
the
sexton
,
and
seemed
to
mock
her
—
to
revile
her
.
<EOS>
Her
fortitude
at
once
deserted
her
.
<EOS>
Her
fingers
were
upon
the
handle
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
She
hesitated
:
<EOS>
she
even
drew
back
,
with
the
intention
of
departing
,
for
she
felt
then
that
she
dared
not
face
Barbara
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
late
—
she
had
moved
the
handle
.
<EOS>
A
deep
voice
from
within
called
to
her
by
name
.
<EOS>
She
dared
not
disobey
that
call
—
she
entered
.
<EOS>
The
room
in
which
Sybil
found
herself
was
the
only
entire
apartment
now
existing
in
the
priory
.
<EOS>
It
had
survived
the
ravages
of
time
;
it
had
escaped
the
devastation
of
man
,
whose
ravages
outstrip
those
of
time
.
<EOS>
Octagonal
,
lofty
,
yet
narrow
,
you
saw
at
once
that
it
formed
the
interior
of
a
turret
.
<EOS>
It
was
lighted
by
a
small
oriel
window
,
commanding
a
lovely
view
of
the
scenery
around
,
and
paneled
with
oak
,
richly
wrought
in
ribs
and
groins
;
and
from
overhead
depended
a
molded
ceiling
of
honeycomb
plaster
-
work
.
<EOS>
This
room
had
something
,
even
now
,
in
the
days
of
its
desecration
,
of
monastic
beauty
about
it
.
<EOS>
Where
the
odor
of
sanctity
had
breathed
forth
,
the
fumes
of
idolatry
prevailed
;
but
imagination
,
ever
on
the
wing
,
flew
back
to
that
period
—
and
a
tradition
to
that
effect
warranted
the
supposition
—
when
,
perchance
,
it
had
been
the
sanctuary
and
the
privacy
of
the
prior
's
self
.
<EOS>
Wrapped
in
a
cloak
composed
of
the
skins
of
various
animals
,
upon
a
low
pallet
,
covered
with
stained
scarlet
cloth
,
sat
Barbara
.
<EOS>
Around
her
head
was
coiffed
,
in
folds
like
those
of
an
Asiatic
turban
,
a
rich
,
though
faded
shawl
,
and
her
waist
was
encircled
with
the
magic
zodiacal
zone
—
proper
to
the
sorceress
—
the
Mago
Cineo
of
the
Cingara
—
whence
the
name
Zingaro
,
according
to
Moncada
—
which
Barbara
had
brought
from
Spain
.
<EOS>
From
her
ears
depended
long
golden
drops
,
of
curious
antique
fashioning
;
and
upon
her
withered
fingers
,
which
looked
like
a
coil
of
lizards
,
were
hooped
a
multitude
of
silver
rings
,
of
the
purest
and
simplest
manufacture
.
<EOS>
They
seemed
almost
of
massive
unwrought
metal
.
<EOS>
Her
skin
was
yellow
as
the
body
of
a
toad
;
corrugated
as
its
back
.
<EOS>
She
might
have
been
steeped
in
saffron
from
her
finger
tips
,
the
nails
of
which
were
of
the
same
hue
,
to
such
portions
of
her
neck
as
were
visible
,
and
which
was
puckered
up
like
the
throat
of
a
turtle
.
<EOS>
To
look
at
her
,
one
might
have
thought
the
embalmer
had
experimented
her
art
upon
herself
.
<EOS>
So
dead
,
so
bloodless
,
so
blackened
seemed
the
flesh
,
where
flesh
remained
,
leather
could
scarce
be
tougher
than
her
skin
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
like
an
animated
mummy
.
<EOS>
A
frame
so
tanned
,
appeared
calculated
to
endure
for
ages
;
and
,
perhaps
,
might
have
done
so
.
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
the
soul
can
not
be
embalmed
.
<EOS>
No
oil
can
re
-
illumine
that
precious
lamp
!
<EOS>
And
that
Barbara
's
vital
spark
was
fast
waning
,
was
evident
from
her
heavy
,
blood
-
shot
eyes
,
once
of
a
swimming
black
,
and
lengthy
as
a
witch
's
,
which
were
now
sinister
and
sunken
.
<EOS>
The
atmosphere
of
the
room
was
as
strongly
impregnated
as
a
museum
with
volatile
odors
,
emitted
from
the
stores
of
drugs
with
which
the
shelves
were
loaded
,
as
well
as
from
various
stuffed
specimens
of
birds
and
wild
animals
.
<EOS>
Barbara
's
only
living
companion
was
a
monstrous
owl
,
which
,
perched
over
the
old
gipsy
's
head
,
hissed
a
token
of
recognition
as
Sybil
advanced
.
<EOS>
From
a
hook
,
placed
in
the
plaster
roof
,
was
suspended
a
globe
of
crystal
glass
,
about
the
size
and
shape
of
a
large
gourd
,
filled
with
a
pure
pellucid
liquid
,
in
which
a
small
snake
,
the
Egyptian
aspic
,
described
perpetual
gyrations
.
<EOS>
Dim
were
the
eyes
of
Barbara
,
yet
not
altogether
sightless
.
<EOS>
The
troubled
demeanor
of
her
grandchild
struck
her
as
she
entered
.
<EOS>
She
felt
the
hot
drops
upon
her
hand
as
Sybil
stooped
to
kiss
it
;
she
heard
her
vainly
-
stifled
sobs
.
<EOS>
"What
ails
you
,
child
?
"
<EOS>
said
Barbara
,
in
a
voice
that
rattled
in
her
throat
,
and
hollow
as
the
articulation
of
a
phantom
.
<EOS>

Have
you
heard
tidings
of
Luke
Bradley
?
<EOS>
Has
any
ill
befallen
him
?
<EOS>
I
said
you
would
either
hear
of
him
or
see
him
this
morning
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
returned
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
What
have
you
heard?""He
is
returned
,
"
replied
Sybil
,
faintly
;
"
and
no
ill
hath
happened
to
him
.
<EOS>
""He
is
returned
,
and
you
are
here
,
"
echoed
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
ill
hath
happened
to
him
,
thou
sayest
—
am
I
to
understand
there
is
—
to
you?"Sybil
answered
not
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
answer
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
see
,
I
see
,
"
said
Barbara
,
more
gently
,
her
head
and
hand
shaking
with
paralytic
affection
:
"
a
quarrel
,
a
lover
's
quarrel
.
<EOS>
Old
as
I
am
,
I
have
not
forgotten
my
feelings
as
a
girl
.
<EOS>
What
woman
ever
does
,
if
she
be
woman
?
<EOS>
and
you
,
like
your
poor
mother
,
are
a
true
-
hearted
wench
.
<EOS>
She
loved
her
husband
,
as
a
husband
should
be
loved
,
Sybil
;
and
though
she
loved
me
well
,
she
loved
him
better
,
as
was
right
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
it
was
a
bitter
day
when
she
left
me
for
Spain
;
for
though
,
to
one
of
our
wandering
race
,
all
countries
are
alike
,
yet
the
soil
of
our
birth
is
dear
to
us
,
and
the
presence
of
our
kindred
dearer
.
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
I
will
not
think
of
that
.
<EOS>
She
is
gone
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
take
it
not
so
to
heart
,
wench
.
<EOS>
Luke
has
a
hasty
temper
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
not
the
first
time
I
have
told
you
so
.
<EOS>
He
will
not
bear
rebuke
,
and
you
have
questioned
him
too
shrewdly
touching
his
absence
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
so
?
<EOS>
Heed
it
not
.
<EOS>
Trust
me
,
you
will
have
him
seek
your
forgiveness
ere
the
shadows
shorten
'
neath
the
noontide
sun
.
<EOS>
""Alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
"
said
Sybil
,
sadly
,
"
this
is
no
lover
's
quarrel
,
which
may
,
at
once
,
be
forgotten
and
forgiven
—
<EOS>
would
it
were
so!""What
is
it
,
then
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Barbara
;
and
without
waiting
Sybil
's
answer
,
she
continued
,
with
vehemence
,
"
has
he
wronged
you
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
girl
,
in
what
way
?
<EOS>
Speak
,
that
I
may
avenge
you
,
if
your
wrong
requires
revenge
.
<EOS>
Are
you
blood
of
mine
,
and
think
I
will
not
do
this
for
you
,
girl
?
<EOS>
None
of
the
blood
of
Barbara
Lovel
were
ever
unrevenged
.
<EOS>
When
Richard
Cooper
stabbed
my
first
-
born
,
Francis
,
he
fled
to
Flanders
to
escape
my
wrath
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
escape
it
.
<EOS>
I
pursued
him
thither
.
<EOS>
I
hunted
him
out
;
drove
him
back
to
his
own
country
,
and
brought
him
to
the
gallows
.
<EOS>
It
took
a
power
of
gold
.
<EOS>
What
matter
?
<EOS>
Revenge
is
dearer
than
gold
.
<EOS>
And
as
it
was
with
Richard
Cooper
,
so
it
shall
be
with
Luke
Bradley
.
<EOS>
I
will
catch
him
,
though
he
run
.
<EOS>
I
will
trip
him
,
though
he
leap
.
<EOS>
I
will
reach
him
,
though
he
flee
afar
.
<EOS>
I
will
drag
him
hither
by
the
hair
of
his
head
,
"
added
she
,
with
a
livid
smile
,
and
clutching
at
the
air
with
her
hands
,
as
if
in
the
act
of
pulling
some
one
towards
her
.
"
<EOS>
He
shall
we
d
you
within
the
hour
,
if
you
will
have
it
,
or
if
your
honor
need
that
it
should
be
so

<EOS>
My
power
is
not
departed
from
me
.
<EOS>
My
people
are

<EOS>
I
am

woe
to
him
that
offendeth
me!""Mother

<EOS>
cried
Sybil
,
affrighted
at
the
storm
she
had
unwittingly
aroused
<EOS>
,
"
he
has
not
injured
me

'
<EOS>
Tis
I
alone
who
am
to
blame

not
Luke

<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
speak
in
mysteries

"
said
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
Piers
Rookwood
is
dead

<EOS>
""Dead
!
"
echoed
Barbara
,
letting
fall
her
hazel
rod
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
dead!""And
Luke
Bradley——""Ha!""Is
his
successor

<EOS>
""Who
told
you
that

<EOS>
asked
Barbara
,
with
increased
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"Luke
himself

<EOS>
All
is
disclosed

"
<EOS>
And
Sybil
hastily
recounted
Luke
's
adventures

<EOS>
"
He
is
now
Sir
Luke
Rookwood

<EOS>
""This
is
news

in

said
Barbara

"
yet
not
news

weep
for

should
rejoice

not

<EOS>
Well

well

I
foresaw

""Dearest

""But

I
perceive
the

truth
flashes
upon
me

has
discarded

<EOS>
""No

""If

ample

Not

Do
you
say
so

because
you
think
that
he
derives
himself
from
a
proud
and
ancient
line
—
ancient
and
proud
—
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
girl
,
that
for
his
one
ancestor
I
can
number
twenty
;
for
the
years
in
which
his
lineage
hath
flourished
,
my
race
can
boast
centuries
,
and
was
a
people
—
a
kingdom!—ere
the
land
in
which
he
dwells
was
known

<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
if
,
by
the
curse
of
Heaven
,
we
were
driven
forth
,
the
curse
of
hell
rests
upon
his
house

<EOS>
""I
know
it

"
said
Sybil
;
"
a
dreadful
curse

,
if
I
we
d
him

will
alight
on
me

<EOS>
""No

not

avoid

<EOS>
Leave
that
to

<EOS>
""I
dare
not
,
as
it
never

tell
me
—
you
saw
the
body

ill

fated
mother

<EOS>
Was
she
poisoned
?
<EOS>
Nay
,
you
may
speak

<EOS>
Sir
Piers
's
death
releases
you
from
your
oath

<EOS>
How
died
she?""By
strangulation

"
said
the
old
gipsy
,
raising
her
palsied
hand
to
her
throat
.
<EOS>
"Oh
!
"
cried
Sybil
,
gasping
with
horror

"
<EOS>
Was
there
a
ring
upon
her
finger
when
you
embalmed
the
body?""A
ring

a
wedding

ring

<EOS>
The
finger
was
crookened
.
<EOS>
Listen
,
girl
,
I
could
have
told
Luke
the
secret
of
his
birth
long
ago
,
but
the
oath
imposed
by
Sir
Piers
sealed
fast
my
lips
.
<EOS>
His
mother
was
wedded
to
Sir
Piers
;
his
mother
was
murdered
by
Sir
Piers
.
<EOS>
Luke
was
entrusted
to
my
care
by
his
father
.
<EOS>
I
have
brought
him
up
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
affianced
you
together
;
and
I
shall
live
to
see
you
united

<EOS>
He
is
now
Sir
Luke
.
<EOS>
He
is
your
husband

<EOS>
""Do
not
deceive
yourself
,
mother

"
said
Sybil
,
with
a
fearful
earnestness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
not
yet
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
;
would
he
had
no
claim
to
be
so
!
<EOS>
The
fortune
that
has
hitherto
been
so
propitious
may
yet
desert
him

<EOS>
Bethink
you
of
a
prophecy
you
uttered
.
<EOS>
""A
prophecy
?
<EOS>
Ha!"And
with
slow
enunciation
Sybil
pronounced
the
mystic
words
which
she
had
heard
repeated
by
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
,
a
gloom
,
like
that
of
a
thunder
-
cloud
,
began
to
gather
over
the
brow
of
the
old
gipsy
.
<EOS>
The
orbs
of
her
sunken
eyes
expanded
,
and
wrath
supplied
her
frame
with
vigor
.
<EOS>
She
arose
.
<EOS>
"Who
told
you
that
?
"
cried
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"Luke
's
grandsire
,
Peter
Bradley

<EOS>
""How
learnt
he
it
?
"
said
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
to
one
who
hath
long
been
in
his
grave

I
told
it
;
so
long
ago
,
it
had
passed
from
my
memory
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
strange
!
<EOS>
old
Sir
Reginald
had
a
brother

I
know

<EOS>
But
there
is
no
other
of
the
house

<EOS>
""There
is
a
cousin

Eleanor
Mowbray

<EOS>
""Ha

<EOS>
I
see
;
a
daughter
of
that
Eleanor
Rookwood
who
fled
from
her
father
's
roof

<EOS>
Fool
,
fool
.
<EOS>
Am
I
caught
in
my
own
toils
?
<EOS>
Those
words
were
words
of
truth
and
power
,
and
compel
the
future
and
'
the
will
be
'
as
with
chains
of
brass
.
<EOS>
They
must
be
fulfilled
,
yet
not
by
Ranulph

<EOS>
He
shall
never

d
Eleanor

""Whom
then
shall
she
wed?""His
elder
brother

""Mother

shrieked
Sybil

Do
you
say
so

<EOS>
Oh
!
recall
your
words

<EOS>
""I

exclaimed
Sybil

<EOS>
"Silly

firm

""Mother

Sybil

innocent

""Peace

Eighteen
summers
have
flown
over
your

eighty
winters
have
sown
their
snows
on
mine

<EOS>
You
have
yet
to
learn

<EOS>
Years
have
brought
wrinkles
—
they
have
brought
wisdom
likewise

<EOS>
To
struggle
with
Fate
,
I
tell
you
,
is
to
wrestle
with
Omnipotence

We
may
foresee
,
but
not
avert
our
destiny

<EOS>
What
will

This
is
your
eighteenth
birthday

Sybil
:
it
is
a
day
of
fate
to
you
;
in
it
occurs
your
planetary
hour
—
an
hour
of
good
or
ill
,
according
to
your
actions
.
<EOS>
I
have
cast
your
horoscope
.
<EOS>
I
have
watched
your
natal
star
;
it
is
under
the
baleful
influence
of
Scorpion
,
and
fiery
Saturn
sheds
his
lurid
glance
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
your
hand
.
<EOS>
The
line
of
life
is
drawn
out
distinct
and
clear
—
it
runs
—
ha
!
<EOS>
what
means
that
intersection
?
<EOS>
Beware
—
beware
,
my
Sybil
.
<EOS>
Act
as
I
tell
you
,
and
you
are
safe

<EOS>
I
will
make
another
trial
,
by
the
crystal
bowl

Attend

<EOS>
"Muttering
<EOS>
some
strange
words
,
sounding
like
a
spell
,
Barbara
,
with
the
bifurcate
hazel
staff
which
she
used
as
a
divining
-
rod
,
described
a
circle
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Within
this
circle
she
drew
other
lines
,
from
angle
to
angle
,
forming
seven
triangles
,
the
bases
of
which
constituted
the
sides
of
a
septilateral
figure
.
<EOS>
This
figure
she
studied
intently
for
a
few
moments
.
<EOS>
She
then
raised
her
wand
and
touched
the
owl
with
it
.
<EOS>
The
bird
unfolded
its
wings
,
and
arose
in
flight
;
then
slowly
circled
round
the
pendulous
globe
.
<EOS>
Each
time
it
drew
nearer
,
until
at
length
it
touched
the
glassy
bowl
with
its
flapping
pinions
.
"Enough
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Barbara
.
<EOS>
And
at
another
motion
from
her
rod
the
bird
stayed
its
flight
and
returned
to
its
perch
.
<EOS>
Barbara
arose
.
<EOS>
She
struck
the
globe
with
her
staff
.
<EOS>
The
pure
lymph
became
instantly
tinged
with
crimson
,
as
if
blood
had
been
commingled
with
it
.
<EOS>
The
little
serpent
could
be
seen
within
,
coiled
up
and
knotted
,
as
in
the
struggles
of
death
.
<EOS>
"Again
<EOS>
I
say
,
beware
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Barbara
,
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
is
ominous
of
ill
.
"Sybil
<EOS>
had
sunk
,
from
faintness
,
on
the
pallet
.
<EOS>
A
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"Who
is
without
?
"
cried
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"'Tis
I
,
Balthazar
,
"
replied
a
voice
.
<EOS>
"Thou
mayest
enter
,
"
answered
Barbara
;
and
an
old
man
with
a
long
beard
,
white
as
snow
,
reaching
to
his
girdle
,
and
a
costume
which
might
be
said
to
resemble
the
raiment
of
a
Jewish
high
priest
,
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
This
venerable
personage
was
no
other
than
the
patrico
,
or
hierophant
of
the
Canting

"I

tell
you
that
there

the

gravely
.
<EOS>
"
I

continued
he
,
addressing
Sybil

"
the

""Whence
come
they

"
exclaimed
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"They
have
ridden

I
understand
,
from
Rookwood

"
answered
the
patrico

<EOS>
"
They
were
on

when
they
were
prevented

<EOS>
""From

Rookwood

"
echoed
Sybil
.
<EOS>
"
Their
names
—
did
you
hear
their
names?""Mowbray
is
the

of
both

they
are
a

asked
Sybil
,
with
an
acute
foreboding
of
calamity
.
<EOS>
"Eleanor
<EOS>
is
the

assuredly

"
replied
the
patrico
,
somewhat
surprised
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
the

I
guess
to

And
as
Balthazar
departed
on

with
a

Barbara
exclaimed
,
"

added
she
,
regarding
the
senseless

of
Sybil

<EOS>
"
Here

stimulate
her

"
opening
the

and
taking

"
this
will
fortify
her

and
this

"
continued
she
,
with
a
ghastly
smile
,
laying
her
hand
upon
another
vessel
,
"
this
shall
remove
her
rival

all
is
fulfilled

IllustrationIN
consequence
of
some
few
words
which
the
sexton
let
fall
in
the
presence
of
the
attendants
,
during
breakfast
,
more
perhaps
by
design
than
accident
,
it
was
speedily
rumored
throughout
the
camp
that
the
redoubted
Richard
Turpin
was
for
the
time
its
inmate
.
<EOS>
This
intelligence
produced
some
such
sensation
as
is
experienced
by
the
inhabitants
of
a
petty
town
on
the
sudden
arrival
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
,
a
commander
-
in
-
chief
,
or
other
illustrious
and
distinguished
personage
,
whose
fame
has
been
vaunted
abroad
amongst
his
fellowmen
by
Rumor
,
"
and
her
thousand
tongues
;
"
and
who
,
like
our
highwayman
,
has
rendered
himself
sufficiently
notorious
to
be
an
object
of
admiration
and
emulation
amongst
his
contemporaries
.
<EOS>
All
started
up
at
the
news
.
<EOS>
The
upright
man
,
the
chief
of
the
crew
,
arose
from
his
chair
,
donned
his
gown
of
state
,
a
very
ancient
brocade
dressing
-
gown
,
filched
,
most
probably
,
from
the
wardrobe
of
some
strolling
player
,
grasped
his
baton
of
office
,
a
stout
oaken
truncheon
,
and
sallied
forth
.
<EOS>
The
ruffler
,
who
found
his
representative
in
a
very
magnificently
equipped
,
and
by
no
means
ill
-
favored
knave
,
whose
chin
was
decorated
with
a
beard
as
lengthy
and
as
black
as
Sultan
Mahmoud
's
,
together
with
the
dexterous
hooker
,
issued
forth
from
the
hovel
which
they
termed
their
boozing
ken
,
eager
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
prince
of
the
high
-
tobygloaks
.
<EOS>
The
limping
palliard
tore
the
bandages
from
his
mock
wounds
,
shouldered
his
crutch
,
and
trudged
hastily
after
them
.
<EOS>
The
whip
-
jack
unbuckled
his
strap
,
threw
away
his
timber
leg
,
and
"
leapt
exulting
,
like
the
bounding
roe
.
"
<EOS>
"
With
such
a
sail
in
sight
,
"
he
said
,
"
he
must
heave
to

like
the
rest

<EOS>
The
dummerar
,
whose
tongue
had
been
cut
out
by
the
Algerines
,
suddenly
found
the
use
of
it
,
and
made
the
welkin
ring
with
his
shouts

<EOS>
Wonderful
were
the
miracles
Dick

the

absolutely

with

followed
at

with

lingered

to
sleek
her

and
to
arrange

and
then
overtook
the
others
;
each
wrinkled
beldame
hobbled
as
quickly
after
as
her
stiffened
joints
would
permit
;
while
the
ancient
patrico
,
the
priest
of
the
crew
—
who
joined
the
couples
together
by
the
hedge
-
side
,
"
with
the
nice
custom
of
dead
horse
between"[26]—brought
up
the
rear
;
all
bent
on
one
grand
object
,
that
of
having
a
peep
at
the
"
foremost
man
of
all
this
prigging
world!"Dick
Turpin
,
at
the
period
of
which
we
treat
,
was
in
the
zenith
of
his
reputation
.
<EOS>
His
deeds
were
full
blown
;
his
exploits
were
in
every
man
's
mouth
;
and
a
heavy
price
was
set
upon
his
head
.
<EOS>
That
he
should
show
himself
thus
openly
,
where
he
might
be
so
easily
betrayed
,
excited
no
little
surprise
among
the
craftiest
of
the
crew
,
and
augured
an
excess
of
temerity
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
Rash
daring
was
the
main
feature
of
Turpin
's
character
.
<EOS>
Like
our
great
Nelson
,
he
knew
fear
only
by
name
;
and
when
he
thus
trusted
himself
in
the
hands
of
strangers
,
confident
in
himself
and
in
his
own
resources
,
he
felt
perfectly
easy
as
to
the
result
.
<EOS>
He
relied
also
in
the
continuance
of
his
good
fortune
,
which
had
as
yet
never
deserted
him
.
<EOS>
Possessed
of
the
belief
that
his
hour
was
not
yet
come
,
he
cared
little
or
nothing
for
any
risk
he
might
incur
;
and
though
he
might
,
undoubtedly
,
have
some
presentiment
of
the
probable
termination
of
his
career
,
he
never
suffered
it
to
militate
against
his
present
enjoyment
,
which
proved
that
he
was
no
despicable
philosopher
.
<EOS>
Turpin
was
the
ultimus
Romanorum
,
the
last
of
a
race
,
which
—
we
were
almost
about
to
say
we
regret
—
is
now
altogether
extinct
.
<EOS>
Several
successors
he
had
,
it
is
true
,
but
no
name
worthy
to
be
recorded
after
his
own
.
<EOS>
With
him
expired
the
chivalrous
spirit
which
animated
successively
the
bosoms
of
so
many
knights
of
the
road
;
with
him
died
away
that
passionate
love
of
enterprise
,
that
high
spirit
of
devotion
to
the
fair
sex
,
which
was
first
breathed
upon
the
highway
by
the
gay
,
gallant
Claude
Du
-
Val
,
the
Bayard
of
the
road
—
<EOS>
Le
filou
sans
peur
<EOS>
et
sans
reproche
—
but
which
was
extinguished
at
last
by
the
cord
that
tied
the
heroic
Turpin
to
the
remorseless
tree
.
<EOS>
It
were
a
subject
well
worthy
of
inquiry
,
to
trace
this
decline
and
fall
of
the
empire
of
the
tobymen
to
its
remoter
causes
;
to
ascertain
the
why
and
the
wherefore
,
that
with
so
many
half
-
pay
captains
;
so
many
poor
curates
;
so
many
lieutenants
,
of
both
services
,
without
hopes
of
promotion
;
so
many
penny
-
a
-
liners
,
and
fashionable
novelists
;
so
many
damned
dramatists
,
and
damning
critics
;
so
many
Edinburgh
and
Quarterly
Reviewers
;
so
many
detrimental
brothers
,
and
younger
sons
;
when
there
are
horses
to
be
hired
,
pistols
to
be
borrowed
,
purses
to
be
taken
,
and
mails
are
as
plentiful
as
partridges
—
it
were
worth
serious
investigation
,
we
repeat
,
to
ascertain
why
,
with
the
best
material
imaginable
for
a
new
race
of
highwaymen
,
we
have
none
,
not
even
an
amateur
.
<EOS>
Why
do
not
some
of
these
choice
spirits
quit
the
salons
of
Pall
-
Mall
,
and
take
to
the
road
?
<EOS>
the
air
of
the
heath
is
more
bracing
and
wholesome
,
we
should
conceive
,
than
that
of
any
"
hell
"
whatever
,
and
the
chances
of
success
incomparably
greater
.
<EOS>
We
throw
out
this
hint
,
without
a
doubt
of
seeing
it
followed
up
.
<EOS>
Probably
the
solution
of
our
inquiry
may
be
,
that
the
supply
is
greater
than
the
demand
;
that
,
in
the
present
state
of
things
,
embryo
highwaymen
may
be
more
abundant
than
purses
;
and
then
,
have
we
not
the
horse
-
patrol
?
<EOS>
With
such
an
admirably
-
organized
system
of
conservation
,
it
is
vain
to
anticipate
a
change
.
<EOS>
The
highwaymen
,
we
fear
,
like
their
Irish
brothers
,
the
Rapparees
,
went
out
with
the
Tories
.
<EOS>
They
were
averse
to
reform
,
and
eschewed
emancipation
.
<EOS>
Lest
any
one
should
think
we
have
overrated
the
pleasures
of
the
highwayman
's
existence
,
they
shall
hear
what
"
the
right
villainous
"
Jack
Hall
,
a
celebrated
tobyman
of
his
day
,
has
got
to
say
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
life
—
the
highwayman's
—
has
,
generally
,
the
most
mirth
and
the
least
care
in
it
of
any
man
's
breathing
,
and
all
he
deals
for
is
clear
profit
:
he
has
that
point
of
good
conscience
,
that
he
always
sells
as
he
buys
,
a
good
pennyworth
,
which
is
something
rare
,
since
he
trades
with
so
small
a
stock
.
<EOS>
The
fence[27
]
<EOS>
and
he
are
like
the
devil
and
the
doctor
<EOS>
,
they
live
by
one
another
;
and
,
like
traitors
,
'
tis
best
to
keep
each
other
's
counsel
.
<EOS>
He
has
this
point
of
honesty
,
that
he
never
robs
the
house
<EOS>
he
frequents"—Turpin
had
the
same
scruples
respecting
the
Hall
of
Rookwood
in
Sir
Piers
's
lifetime
—
;
"
and
perhaps
pays
his
debts
better
than
some
others
,
for
he
holds
it
below
the
dignity
of
his
employment
to
commit
<EOS>
so
ungenteel
a
crime
as
insolvency
,
and
loves
to
pay
nobly
.
<EOS>
He
has
another
quality
,
not
much
amiss
,
that
he
takes
no
more
than
he
has
occasion
for"—Jack
,
we
think
,
was
a
little
mistaken
here
—
;
"
which
he
verifies
this
way
<EOS>
:
he
craves
no
more
while
that
lasts
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
less
nuisance
in
a
commonwealth
than
a
miser
,
because
the
money
he
engrosses
all
circulates
again
,
which
the
other
hoards
as
though
'
twere
only
to
be
found
again
at
the
day
of
judgment
.
<EOS>
He
is
the
tithe
-
pig
of
his
family
,
which
the
gallows
,
instead
of
the
parson
,
claims
as
its
due
.
<EOS>
He
has
reason
enough
to
be
bold
in
his
undertakings
,
for
,
though
all
the
world
threaten
him
,
he
stands
in
fear
of
but
one
man
in
it
,
and
that
's
the
hangman
;
and
with
him
,
too
,
he
is
generally
in
fee
:
<EOS>
however
,
I
can
not
affirm
he
is
so
valiant
that
he
dares
look
any
man
in
the
face
,
for
in
that
point
he
is
now
and
then
,
a
little
modest
.
<EOS>
Newgate
may
be
said
to
be
his
country
-
house
,
where
he
frequently
lives
so
many
months
in
the
year
;
and
he
is
not
so
much
concerned
to
be
carried
thither
for
a
small
matter
,
if
'
twere
only
for
the
benefit
of
renewing
his
acquaintance
there
.
<EOS>
He
holds
a
petit
larceny
as
light
as
a
nun
<EOS>
does
auricular
confession
,
though
the
priest
has
a
more
compassionate
character
than
the
hangman
.
<EOS>
Every
man
in
this
community
is
esteemed
according
to
his
particular
quality
,
of
which
there
are
several
degrees
,
though
it
is
contrary
often
to
public
government
;
for
here
a
man
shall
be
valued
purely
for
his
merit
,
and
rise
by
it
too
,
though
it
be
but
to
a
halter
,
in
which
there
is
a
great
deal
of
glory
in
dying
like
a
hero
,
and
making
a
decent
figure
in
the
cart
to
the
last
two
staves
of
the
fifty
-
first
psalm
.
<EOS>
"[28]This
,
we
repeat

is
the
plain
statement

practical
man

again
we
throw

All
we

is
,
that
we
are
now
degenerated
from
the

to
the

the

,
about
whom
there
are
no

features

How
much
lower
the

of

dive
it

"Cervantes

the

<EOS>
Macheath
gave
the
highwayman
his
coup
de
grâce
.
<EOS>
The
last
of
this
race
—
for
we
must
persist
in
maintaining
that
he
was
the
last
—
,
Turpin
,
like
the
setting
sun
,
threw
up
some
parting
rays
of
glory
,
and
tinged
the
far
highways
with
a
luster
that
may
yet
be
traced
like
a
cloud
of
dust
raised
by
his
horse
's
retreating
heels
.
<EOS>
Unequalled
in
the
command
of
his
steed
,
the
most
singular
feat
that
the
whole
race
of
the
annals
of
horsemanship
has
to
record
,
and
of
which
we
may
have
more
to
say
hereafter
,
was
achieved
by
him
.
<EOS>
So
perfect
was
his
jockeyship
,
so
clever
his
management
of
the
animal
he
mounted
,
so
intimately
acquainted
was
he
with
every
cross
-
road
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
metropolis
—
a
book
of
which
he
constructed
,
and
carried
constantly
about
his
person
—
,
as
well
as
with
many
other
parts
of
England
,
particularly
the
counties
of
Chester
,
York
,
and
Lancaster
,
that
he
outstripped
every
pursuer
,
and
baffled
all
attempts
at
capture
.
<EOS>
His
reckless
daring
,
his
restless
rapidity
—
for
so
suddenly
did
he
change
his
ground
,
and
renew
his
attacks
in
other
quarters
,
that
he
seemed
to
be
endowed
with
ubiquity,—his
bravery
,
his
resolution
,
and
,
above
all
,
his
generosity
,
won
for
him
a
high
reputation
amongst
his
compatriots
,
and
even
elicited
applauses
from
those
upon
whom
he
levied
his
contributions
.
<EOS>
Beyond
dispute
,
he
ruled
as
master
of
the
road
.
<EOS>
His
hands
were
,
as
yet
,
unstained
with
blood
;
he
was
ever
prompt
to
check
the
disposition
to
outrage
,
and
to
prevent
,
as
much
as
lay
in
his
power
,
the
commission
of
violence
by
his
associates
.
<EOS>
Of
late
,
since
he
had
possessed
himself
of
his
favorite
mare
,
Black
Bess
,
his
robberies
had
been
perpetrated
with
a
suddenness
of
succession
,
and
at
distances
so
apparently
impracticable
,
that
the
idea
of
all
having
been
executed
by
one
man
,
was
rejected
as
an
impossibility
;
and
the
only
way
of
reconciling
the
description
of
the
horse
and
rider
,
which
tallied
in
each
instance
,
was
the
supposition
that
these
attacks
were
performed
by
confederates
similarly
mounted
and
similarly
accoutred
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
in
all
this
,
as
much
of
the
"
famæ
sacra
fames
"
as
of
the
"
auri
;
"
of
the
hungering
after
distinction
,
as
well
as
of
the
appetite
of
gain
.
<EOS>
Enamored
of
his
vocation
,
Turpin
delighted
to
hear
himself
designated
as
the
Flying
Highwayman
;
and
it
was
with
rapturous
triumph
that
he
found
his
single
-
handed
feats
attributed
to
a
band
of
marauders
.
<EOS>
But
this
state
of
things
could
not
long
endure
;
his
secret
was
blown
<EOS>
;
the
vigilance
of
the
police
was
aroused
;
he
was
tracked
to
his
haunts
;
and
,
after
a
number
of
hairbreadth
'
scapes
,
which
he
only
effected
by
miracle
,
or
by
the
aid
of
his
wonder
-
working
mare
,
he
reluctantly
quitted
the
heathy
hills
of
Bagshot
,
the
Pampas
plains
of
Hounslow
—
over
which
like
an
archetype
of
the
galloping
Sir
Francis
Head
,
he
had
so
often
scoured,—the
gorsy
commons
of
Highgate
,
Hampstead
,
and
Finchley
,
the
marshy
fields
of
Battersea
,
almost
all
of
which
he
had
been
known
to
visit
in
a
single
night
,
and
leaving
these
beaten
tracks
to
the
occupation
of
younger
and
less
practised
hands
,
he
bequeathed
to
them
,
at
the
same
time
,
his
own
reversionary
interest
in
the
gibbets
thereupon
erected
,
and
betook
himself
to
the
country
.
<EOS>
After
a
journey
of
more
or
less
success
,
our
adventurer
found
himself
at
Rookwood
,
whither
he
had
been
invited
after
a
grand
field
-
day
by
its
hospitable
and
by
no
means
inquisitive
owner
.
<EOS>
Breach
of
faith
and
good
fellowship
formed
no
part
of
Turpin
's
character
;
he
had
his
lights
as
well
as
his
shades
;
and
as
long
as
Sir
Piers
lived
,
his
purse
and
coffers
would
have
been
free
from
molestation
,
except
,
"
so
far
,
"
Dick
said
,
"
as
a
cog
or
two
of
dice
went
.
<EOS>
My
dice
,
you
know
,
are
longs
for
odd
and
even
,
a
bale
of
bar'd
cinque
deuces
,
"
a
pattern
of
which
he
always
carried
with
him
<EOS>
;
beyond
this
,
excepting
a
take
-
in
at
a
steeple
chase
,
Rookwood
church
being
the
mark
,
a
"
do
"
at
a
leap
,
or
some
such
trifle
,
to
which
the
most
scrupulous
could
not
raise
an
objection
,
Dick
was
all
fair
and
above
-
board
.
<EOS>
But
when
poor
Sir
Piers
had
"
put
on
his
wooden
surtout
,
"
to
use
Dick
's
own
expressive
metaphor
,
his
conscientious
scruples
evaporated
into
thin
air
.
<EOS>
Lady
Rookwood
was
nothing
to
him
;
there
was
excellent
booty
to
be
appropriated
—
<EOS>
The
wise
convey
it
call
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
look
about
for
hands
;
and
having
accidentally
encountered
his
old
comrades
,
Rust
and
Wilder
,
they
were
let
into
the
business
,
which
was
imperfectly
accomplished
in
the
manner
heretofore
described
.
<EOS>
To
return
from
this
digression
.
<EOS>
When
Turpin
presented
himself
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
,
on
his
way
to
inquire
after
his
mare
,
to
his
astonishment
he
found
it
closely
invested
.
<EOS>
A
cheering
shout
from
the
tawny
throng
,
succeeded
by
a
general
clapping
of
hands
,
and
attended
by
a
buzzing
susurration
of
applause
,
such
as
welcomes
the
entrance
of
a
popular
actor
upon
the
stage
,
greeted
the
appearance
of
the
highwayman
.
<EOS>
At
the
first
sight
of
the
crowd
he
was
a
little
startled
,
and
involuntarily
sought
for
his
pistols
.
<EOS>
But
the
demonstrations
of
admiration
were
too
unequivocal
to
be
for
a
moment
mistaken
;
his
hand
was
drawn
from
his
pocket
to
raise
his
hat
from
his
brow
.
<EOS>
Thunders
of
applause
.
<EOS>
Turpin
's
external
man
,
we
have
before
said
,
was
singularly
prepossessing
.
<EOS>
It
was
especially
so
in
the
eyes
of
the
sex
—
fair
<EOS>
we
certainly
can
not
say
upon
the
present
occasion
—
,
amongst
whom
not
a
single
dissentient
voice
was
to
be
heard
.
<EOS>
All
concurred
in
thinking
him
a
fine
fellow
;
could
plainly
read
his
high
courage
in
his
bearing
;
his
good
breeding
in
his
débonnaire
deportment
;
and
his
manly
beauty
in
his
extravagant
red
whiskers
.
<EOS>
Dick
saw
the
effect
that
he
produced
.
<EOS>
He
was
at
home
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Your
true
highwayman
has
ever
a
passion
for
effect
.
<EOS>
This
does
not
desert
him
at
the
gallows
;
it
rises
superior
to
death
itself
,
and
has
been
known
to
influence
the
manner
of
his
dangling
from
the
gibbet
!
<EOS>
To
hear
some
one
cry
,
"
There
goes
a
proper
handsome
man
,
"
saith
our
previously
quoted
authority
,
Jack
Hall
,
"
somewhat
ameliorates
the
terrible
thoughts
of
the
meagre
tyrant
death
;
and
to
go
in
a
dirty
shirt
were
enough
to
save
the
hangman
a
labor
,
and
make
a
man
die
with
grief
and
shame
at
being
in
that
deplorable
condition
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
a
gracious
smile
of
condescension
,
like
a
popular
orator
—
with
a
look
of
blarney
like
that
of
O'Connell
,
and
of
assurance
like
that
of
Hume
—
he
surveyed
the
male
portion
of
the
spectators
,
tipped
a
knowing
wink
at
the
prettiest
brunettes
he
could
select
,
and
finally
cut
a
sort
of
fling
with
his
well
-
booted
legs
,
that
brought
down
another
appeal
of
rapturous
applause
.
<EOS>
"A
rank
scamp!"[29
]
cried
the
upright
man
;
and
this
exclamation
,
however
equivocal
it
may
sound
,
was
intended
,
on
his
part
,
to
be
highly
complimentary
.
<EOS>
"I
believe
ye

"
returned
the
ruffler
,
stroking
his
chin—"one
may
see
that
he
's
no
half
swell

the
care
with
which
he
cultivates

his

in
the

<EOS>

Look
at
his
rigging

how
he
flashes
his
sticks[33]—those
are
the
tools
to
rake

"The

who
had
encountered
one
of
the
free
and
frolicsome
glances
which
our
highwayman
distributed
so
liberally
among
the
petticoats
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
this
crisis
Dick
took
off
his
hat

<EOS>
Cæsar
betrayed
his

<EOS>
"A

cried
the
men
,
compassionating
his
thinly
covered
skull
,
and
twisting
their
own
ringlets
,
glossy
and
luxuriant
,
though
unconscious
of
Macassar

"
<EOS>
A
thousand
pities
that
so
fine
a
fellow
should
have
a
sconce
like
a
cocoanut!""But
then
his
red
whiskers
,
"
rejoined
the
women
,
tired
of
the
uniformity
of
thick
black
heads
of
hair
;
"
what
a
warmth
of
coloring
they
impart
to
his
face
;
and
then
only
look
how
beautifully
bushy
they
make
his
cheeks
appear!"La
Fosseuse
and
the
court
of
the
Queen
of
Navarre
were
not
more
smitten
with
the
Sieur
de
Croix
's
jolly
pair
of
whiskers
.
<EOS>
The
hawk
's
eye
of
Turpin
ranged
over
the
whole
assemblage
.
<EOS>
Amidst
that
throng
of
dark
faces
there
was
not
one
familiar
to
him
.
<EOS>
Before
him
stood
the
upright
man
,
Zoroaster
—
so
was
he
called
—
,
a
sturdy
,
stalwart
rogue
,
whose
superior
strength
and
stature
—
as
has
not
unfrequently
been
the
case
in
the
infancy
of
governments
that
have
risen
to
more
importance
than
is
likely
to
be
the
case
with
that
of
Lesser
Egypt
—
had
been
the
means
of
his
elevation
to
his
present
dignified
position
.
<EOS>
Zoroaster
literally
fought
his
way
upwards
,
and
had
at
first
to
maintain
his
situation
by
the
strong
arm
;
but
he
now
was
enabled
to
repose
upon
his
hard
-
won
laurels
,
to
smoke
"
the
calumet
of
peace
,
"
and
quaff
his
tipple
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
For
one
of
gipsy
blood
,
he
presented
an
unusually
jovial
,
liquor
-
loving
countenance
:
his
eye
was
mirthful
;
his
lip
moist
,
as
if
from
oft
potations
;
his
cheek
mellow
as
an
Orleans
plum
,
which
fruit
,
in
color
and
texture
,
it
mightily
resembled
.
<EOS>
Strange
to
say
,
also
,
for
one
of
that
lithe
race
,
his
person
was
heavy
and
hebetudinous
;
the
consequence
,
no
doubt
,
of
habitual
intemperance
.
<EOS>
Like
Cribb
,
he
waxed
obese
upon
the
championship
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
kind
of
mock
state
in
his
carriage
,
as
he
placed
himself
before
Turpin
,
and
with
his
left
hand
twisted
up
the
tail
of
his
dressing
-
gown
,
while
the
right
thrust
his
truncheon
into
his
hip
,
which
was
infinitely
diverting
to
the
highwayman
.
<EOS>
Turpin
's
attention
,
however
,
was
chiefly
directed
towards
his
neighbor
,
the
ruffler
,
in
whom
he
recognized
a
famous
impostor
of
the
day
,
with
whose
history
he
was
sufficiently
well
acquainted
to
be
able
at
once
to
identify
the
individual
.
<EOS>
We
have
before
stated
,
that
a
magnificent
coal
-
black
beard
decorated
the
chin
of
this
worthy
;
but
this
was
not
all
—
his
costume
was
in
perfect
keeping
with
his
beard
,
and
consisted
of
a
very
theatrical
-
looking
tunic
,
upon
the
breast
of
which
was
embroidered
,
in
golden
wire
,
the
Maltese
cross
;
while
over
his
shoulders
were
thrown
the
folds
of
an
ample
cloak
of
Tyrian
hue
.
<EOS>
To
his
side
was
girt
a
long
and
doughty
sword
,
which
he
termed
,
in
his
knightly
phrase
,
Excalibur
;
and
upon
his
profuse
hair
rested
a
hat
as
broad
in
the
brim
as
a
Spanish
sombrero
.
<EOS>
Exaggerated
as
this
description
may
appear
,
we
can
assure
our
readers
that
it
is
not
overdrawn
;
and
that
a
counterpart
of
the
sketch
we
have
given
of
the
ruffler
certainly
"
strutted
his
hour
"
upon
the
stage
of
human
life
,
and
that
the
very
ancient
and
discriminating
city
of
Canterbury
—
to
which
be
all
honor
—
was
his
theatre
of
action
.
<EOS>
His
history
is
so
far
curious
,
that
it
exemplifies
,
more
strongly
than
a
thousand
discourses
could
do
,
how
prone
we
are
to
be
governed
by
appearances
,
and
how
easily
we
may
be
made
the
dupes
of
a
plausible
impostor
.
<EOS>
Be
it
remembered
,
however
,
that
we
treat
of
the
eighteenth
century
,
before
the
march
of
intellect
had
commenced
;
we
are
much
too
knowing
to
be
similarly
practised
upon
in
these
enlightened
times
.
<EOS>
But
we
will
let
the
knight
of
Malta
,
for
such
was
the
title
assumed
by
the
ruffler
,
tell
his
own
story
in
his
own
way
hereafter
;
contenting
ourselves
with
the
moral
precepts
we
have
already
deduced
from
it
.
<EOS>
Next
to
the
knight
of
Malta
stood
the
whip
-
jack
,
habited
in
his
sailor
gear
—
striped
shirt
and
dirty
canvas
trousers
;
and
adjoining
him
was
the
palliard
,
a
loathsome
tatterdemalion
,
his
dress
one
heap
of
rags
,
and
his
discolored
skin
one
mass
of
artificial
leprosy
and
imposthumes
.
<EOS>
As
Turpin
's
eye
shifted
from
one
to
another
of
these
figures
,
he
chanced
upon
an
individual
who
had
been
long
endeavoring
to
arrest
his
attention
.
<EOS>
This
personage
was
completely
in
the
background
.
<EOS>
All
that
Dick
could
discern
of
him
was
a
brown
curly
head
of
hair
,
carelessly
arranged
in
the
modern
mode
;
a
handsome
,
impudent
,
sun
-
freckled
face
,
with
one
eye
closed
,
and
the
other
occupied
by
a
broken
bottle
-
neck
,
through
which
,
as
a
substitute
for
a
lorgnette
,
the
individual
reconnoitered
him
.
<EOS>
A
cocked
hat
was
placed
in
a
very
dégagée
manner
under
his
arm
,
and
he
held
an
ebony
cane
in
his
hand
,
very
much
in
the
style
of
a
"
fassionable
,
"
as
the
French
have
it
,
of
the
present
day
.
<EOS>
This
glimpse
was
sufficient
to
satisfy
Turpin
.
<EOS>
He
recognized
in
this
whimsical
personage
an
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Jerry
Juniper
was
what
the
classical
Captain
Grose
would
designate
a
"
gentleman
with
three
outs
,
"
and
,
although
he
was
not
entirely
without
wit
,
nor
,
his
associates
avouched
,
without
money
,
nor
,
certainly
,
in
his
own
opinion
,
<EOS>
had
that
been
asked
,
without
manners
;
yet
was
he
assuredly
without
shoes
,
without
stockings
,
without
shirt
.
<EOS>
This
latter
deficiency
was
made
up
by
a
voluminous
cravat
,
tied
with
proportionately
large
bows
.
<EOS>
A
jaunty
pair
of
yellow
breeches
,
somewhat
faded
;
a
waistcoat
of
silver
brocade
,
richly
embroidered
,
somewhat
tarnished
and
lack
-
lustre
;
<EOS>
a
murrey
-
colored
velvet
coat
,
somewhat
chafed
,
completed
the
costume
of
this
beggar
Brummell
,
this
mendicant
macaroni!Jerry
Juniper
was
a
character
well
known
at
the
time
,
as
a
constant
frequenter
of
all
races
,
fairs
,
regattas
,
ship
-
launches
,
bull
-
baits
,
and
prize
-
fights
,
all
of
which
he
attended
,
and
to
which
he
transported
himself
with
an
expedition
little
less
remarkable
than
that
of
Turpin
.
<EOS>
You
met
him
at
Epsom
,
at
Ascot
,
at
Newmarket
,
at
Doncaster
,
at
the
Roodee
of
Chester
,
at
the
Curragh
of
Kildare
.
<EOS>
The
most
remote
as
well
as
the
most
adjacent
meeting
attracted
him
.
<EOS>
The
cock
-
pit
was
his
constant
haunt
,
and
in
more
senses
than
one
was
he
a
leg
.
<EOS>
No
opera
-
dancer
could
be
more
agile
,
more
nimble
;
scarcely
,
indeed
,
more
graceful
,
than
was
Jerry
,
with
his
shoeless
and
stockingless
feet
;
and
the
manner
in
which
he
executed
a
pirouette
,
or
a
pas
,
before
a
line
of
carriages
,
seldom
failed
to
procure
him
"
golden
opinions
from
all
sorts
of
dames
.
<EOS>
"
With
the
ladies
,
it
must
be
owned
,
Jerry
was
rather
upon
too
easy
terms
;
but
then
,
perhaps
,
the
ladies
were
upon
too
easy
terms
with
Jerry
;
and
if
a
bright
-
eyed
fair
one
condescended
to
jest
with
him
,
what
marvel
if
he
should
sometimes
slightly
transgress
the
laws
of
decorum
.
<EOS>
These
aberrations
,
however
,
were
trifling
;
altogether
he
was
so
well
known
,
and
knew
everybody
else
so
well
,
that
he
seldom
committed
himself
;
and
,
singular
to
say
,
could
on
occasions
even
be
serious
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
his
other
faculties
,
no
one
cut
a
sly
joke
,
or
trolled
a
merry
ditty
,
better
than
Jerry
.
<EOS>
His
peculiarities
,
in
short
,
were
on
the
pleasant
side
,
and
he
was
a
general
favorite
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
did
Jerry
perceive
that
he
was
recognized
,
than
,
after
kissing
his
hand
,
with
the
air
of
a
petit
-
ma
tre
,
to
the
highwayman
,
he
strove
to
edge
his
way
through
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
All
his
efforts
were
fruitless
;
and
,
tired
of
a
situation
in
the
rear
rank
,
so
inconsistent
,
he
conceived
,
with
his
own
importance
,
he
had
recourse
to
an
expedient
often
practised
with
success
in
harlequinades
,
and
not
unfrequently
in
real
life
,
where
a
flying
leap
is
occasionally
taken
over
our
heads
.
<EOS>
He
ran
back
a
few
yards
to
give
himself
an
impetus
,
returned
,
and
,
placing
his
hands
upon
the
shoulders
of
a
stalwart
vagabond
near
to
him
,
threw
a
summerset
upon
the
broad
cap
of
a
palliard
,
who
was
so
jammed
in
the
midst
that
he
could
not
have
stirred
to
avoid
the
shock
;
thence
,
without
pausing
,
he
vaulted
forwards
,
and
dropped
lightly
upon
the
ground
in
front
of
Zoroaster
,
and
immediately
before
the
highwayman
.
<EOS>
Dick
laughed
immoderately
at
Jerry
's
manoeuvre
.
<EOS>
He
shook
his
old
chum
cordially
by
the
hand
,
saying
,
in
a
whisper
,
"
What
the
devil
brings
you
here
,
Jerry?""I
<EOS>
might
retort
,
and
ask
you
that
question
,
Captain
Turpin
,
"
replied
Jerry
,
sotto
voce
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
odd
to
see
me
here
,
certainly
—
quite
out
of
my
element
—
lost
amongst
this
canaille
—
<EOS>
this
Canting
Crew
—
all
the
fault
of
a
pair
of
gipsy
eyes
,
bright
as
a
diamond
,
dark
as
a
sloe
.
<EOS>
You
comprehend
—
a
little
affair
,
ha
!
<EOS>
Liable
to
these
things
.
<EOS>
Bring
your
ear
closer
,
my
boy
;
be
upon
your
guard
—
keep
a
sharp
look
out
—
there
's
a
devil
of
a
reward
upon
your
head
—
I
wo
n't
answer
for
all
those
rascals
.
<EOS>
""Thank
you
for
the
hint
,
Jerry
,
"
replied
Dick
,
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
calculated
my
chances
pretty
nicely
when
I
came
here
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
should
perceive
any
symptoms
of
foul
play
—
any
attempt
to
snitch
or
nose
,
amongst
this
pack
of
peddlers
—
I
have
a
friend
or
two
at
hand
,
who
wo
n't
be
silent
upon
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Rest
assured
I
shall
have
my
eye
upon
the
gnarling
scoundrels
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
be
sold
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
""Trust
<EOS>
you
for
that
,
"
returned
Juniper
,
with
a
wink
.
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
"
added
he
;
"
a
thought
strikes
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
scheme
in
petto
which
may
,
perhaps
,
afford
you
some
fun
,
and
will
,
at
all
events
,
insure
your
safety
during
your
stay
.
<EOS>
""What
is
it
?
"
asked
Dick
.
<EOS>
"Just
<EOS>
amuse
yourself
with
a
flirtation
for
a
moment
or
two
with
that
pretty
damsel
,
who
has
been
casting
her
ogles
at
you
for
the
last
five
minutes
without
success
,
while
I
effect
a
master
-
stroke
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
as
Turpin
,
nothing
loth
,
followed
his
advice
,
Jerry
addressed
himself
to
Zoroaster
.
<EOS>
After
a
little
conference
,
accompanied
by
that
worthy
and
the
knight
of
Malta
,
the
trio
stepped
forward
from
the
line
,
and
approached
Dick
,
<EOS>
when
Juniper
,
assuming
some
such
attitude
as
our
admirable
Jones
,
the
comedian
,
is
wo
nt
to
display
,
delivered
himself
of
the
following
address
.
<EOS>
Turpin
listened
with
the
gravity
of
one
of
the
distinguished
persons
alluded
to
,
at
the
commencement
of
the
present
chapter
,
upon
their
receiving
the
freedom
of
the
city
at
the
hands
of
a
mayor
and
corporation
.
<EOS>
Thus
spoke
Jerry:"Highest
of
High
-
Tobymen
!
<EOS>
rummest
of
rum
Padders
,
and
most
scampish
of
Scampsmen
!
<EOS>
We
,
in
the
name
of
Barbara
,
our
most
tawny
queen
;
in
the
name
of
Zoroaster
,
our
Upright
Man
,
Dimber
Damber
,
or
Olli
Campolli
,
by
all
which
titles
his
excellency
is
distinguished
;
in
our
own
respective
names
,
as
High
Pads
and
Low
Pads
,
Rum
Gills
and
Queer
Gills
,
Patricos
,
Palliards
,
Priggers
,
Whip
-
Jacks
,
and
Jarkmen
,
from
the
Arch
Rogue
to
the
Needy
Mizzler
,
fully
sensible
of
the
honor
you
have
conferred
upon
us
in
gracing
Stop
-
Hole
Abbey
with
your
presence
;
and
conceiving
that
we
can
in
no
way
evince
our
sense
of
your
condescension
so
entirely
as
by
offering
you
the
freedom
of
our
crew
,
together
with
the
privileges
of
an
Upright
Man,[34
]
which
you
may
be
aware
are
considerable
,
and
by
creating
you
an
honorary
member
of
the
Vagrant
Club
,
which
we
have
recently
established
;
and
in
so
doing
,
we
would
fain
express
the
sentiments
of
gratification
and
pride
which
we
experience
in
enrolling
among
our
members
one
who
has
extended
the
glory
of
roguery
so
widely
over
the
land
,
and
who
has
kicked
up
such
a
dust
upon
the
highways
of
England
,
as
most
effectually
to
blind
the
natives
—
one
who
is
in
himself
a
legion
—
of
highwaymen
!
<EOS>
Awaiting
,
with
respectful
deference
,
the
acquiescence
of
Captain
Richard
Turpin
,
we
beg
to
tender
him
the
freedom
of
our
crew
.
<EOS>
""Really
,
gentlemen
<EOS>
,
"
said
Turpin
,
who
did
not
exactly
see
the
drift
of
this
harangue
,
"
you
do
me
a
vast
deal
of
honor
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
at
a
loss
to
conceive
how
I
can
possibly
have
merited
so
much
attention
at
your
hands
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
feel
myself
so
unworthy
—
—
"
Here
Dick
received
an
expressive
wink
from
Juniper
,
and
therefore
thought
it
prudent
to
alter
his
expression
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Could
I
suppose
myself
at
all
deserving
of
so
much
distinction
,
"
continued
the
modest
speaker
,
"
I
should
at
once
accept
your
very
obliging
offer
;
but——""None
so
worthy
,
"
said
the
upright
man
.
<EOS>
"Can't
<EOS>
hear
of
a
refusal
,
"
said
the
knight
of
Malta
.
<EOS>
"Refusal
—
impossible
!
<EOS>
"
reiterated
Juniper
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
;
no
refusal
,
"
exclaimed
a
chorus
of
voices
.
"
<EOS>
Dick
Turpin
must
be
one
of
us
.
<EOS>
He
shall
be
our
dimber
damber
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
gentlemen
,
since
you
are
so
pressing
,
"
replied
Turpin
,
"
<EOS>
even
so
be
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
your
dimber
damber
.
<EOS>
""Bravo
!
<EOS>
bravo

"
<EOS>
cried
the
mob
,
not
"
of
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
""About
it

once

said
the
knight
of
Malta
,
flourishing
Excalibur
.

"
<EOS>
By
St.
Thomas
à
Becket
,
we
'll
have
as
fine
a
scene
as
I
myself
ever
furnished
to
the
Canterbury
lieges
.
<EOS>
""About
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Dick
.
<EOS>
"Your
matriculation
,
"
replied
Jerry
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
certain
forms
to
be
gone
through
,
with
an
oath
to
be
taken
,
merely
a
trifle

<EOS>
We
'll
have
a
jolly
booze
when
all
's
over

<EOS>
Come

<EOS>
a

<EOS>

"
echoed
the
crew
.
<EOS>
"I've
brought
you
through
,
"
said
Jerry
,
taking
advantage
of
the
uproar
that
ensued
to
whisper
to
his
chum
;
"
none
of
them
will
dare
to
lift
a
finger
against
you
now
.
<EOS>
They
are
all
your
friends
for
life
.
<EOS>
""Nevertheless
<EOS>
,
"
returned
Turpin
,
"
I
should
be
glad
to
know
what
has
become
of
Bess
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
it
's
your
prancer
<EOS>
you
are
wanting
,
"
chirped
a
fluttering
creature
,
whom
Turpin
recognized
as
Luke
's
groom
,
Grasshopper
,
"
<EOS>
I
gave
her
a
fresh
loaf
and
a
stoup
of
stingo
,
as
you
bade
me
,
and
there
she
be
,
under
yon
tree
,
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
see
her
,
"
replied
Turpin
;
"
just
tighten
her
girths
,
Grasshopper
,
and
bring
her
after
me
,
and
thou
shalt
have
wherewithal
to
chirp
over
thy
cups
at
supper
.
<EOS>
"Away
bounded
the
elfin
dwarf
to
execute
his
behest
.
<EOS>
A
loud
shout
now
rent
the
skies
,
and
presently
afterwards
was
heard
the
vile
scraping
of
a
fiddle
,
accompanied
by
the
tattoo
of
a
drum
.
<EOS>
Approaching
Turpin
,
a
host
of
gipsies
elevated
the
highwayman
upon
their
shoulders
,
and
in
this
way
he
was
carried
to
the
centre
of
the
green
,
where
the
long
oaken
table
,
which
had
once
served
the
Franciscans
for
refection
,
was
now
destined
for
the
stage
of
the
pageant
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
table
three
drums
were
placed
;
and
Turpin
was
requested
to
seat
himself
on
the
central
one
.
<EOS>
A
solemn
prelude
,
more
unearthly
than
the
incantation
in
the
Freyschütz
,
was
played
by
the
orchestra
of
the
band
,
conducted
by
the
Paganini
of
the
place
,
who
elicited
the
most
marvellous
notes
from
his
shell
.
<EOS>
A
couple
of
shawms[35
]
emitted
sepulchral
sounds
,
while
the
hollow
rolling
of
a
drum
broke
ever
and
anon
upon
the
ear
.
<EOS>
The
effect
was
prodigiously
fine
.
<EOS>
During
this
overture
the
patrico
and
the
upright
man
had
ascended
the
rostrum
,
each
taking
his
place
;
the
former
on
the
right
hand
of
Turpin
,
the
latter
upon
his
left
.
<EOS>
Below
them
stood
the
knight
of
Malta
,
with
Excalibur
drawn
in
his
hand
,
and
gleaming
in
the
sunshine
.
<EOS>
On
the
whole
,
Dick
was
amused
with
what
he
saw
,
and
with
the
novel
situation
in
which
he
found
himself
placed
.
<EOS>
Around
the
table
were
congregated
a
compact
mass
of
heads
;
so
compact
,
indeed
,
that
they
looked
like
one
creature
—
an
Argus
,
with
each
eye
upturned
upon
the
highwayman
.
<EOS>
The
idea
struck
Turpin
that
the
restless
mass
of
parti
-
colored
shreds
and
patches
,
of
vivid
hues
and
varied
tintings
,
singularly
,
though
accidentally
,
disposed
to
produce
such
an
effect
,
resembled
an
immense
tiger
-
moth
,
or
it
might
be
a
Turkey
carpet
spread
out
upon
the
grass!The
scene
was
a
joyous
one
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
brilliant
sunshiny
morning
.
<EOS>
Freshened
and
purified
by
the
storm
of
the
preceding
night
,
the
air
breathed
a
balm
upon
the
nerves
and
senses
of
the
robber
.
<EOS>
The
wooded
hills
were
glittering
in
light
;
the
brook
was
flowing
swiftly
past
the
edge
of
the
verdant
slope
,
glancing
like
a
wreathed
snake
in
the
sunshine
—
its
"
quiet
song
"
lost
in
the
rude
harmony
of
the
mummers
,
as
were
the
thousand
twitterings
of
the
rejoicing
birds
;
the
rocks
bared
their
bosoms
to
the
sun
,
or
were
buried
in
deep
-
cast
gloom
;
the
shadows
of
the
pillars
and
arches
of
the
old
walls
of
the
priory
were
projected
afar
,
while
the
rose
-
like
ramifications
of
the
magnificent
marigold
window
were
traced
,
as
if
by
a
pencil
,
upon
the
verdant
tablet
of
the
sod
.
<EOS>
The
overture
was
finished
.
<EOS>
With
the
appearance
of
the
principal
figures
in
this
strange
picture
the
reader
is
already
familiar
.
<EOS>
It
remains
only
to
give
him
some
idea
of
the
patrico
.
<EOS>
Imagine
,
then
,
an
old
superannuated
goat
,
reared
upon
its
hind
legs
,
and
clad
in
a
white
sheet
,
disposed
in
folds
like
those
of
a
simar
about
its
limbs
,
and
you
will
have
some
idea
of
Balthazar
,
the
patrico
.
<EOS>
This
resemblance
to
the
animal
before
mentioned
was
rendered
the
more
striking
by
his
huge
,
hanging
,
goat
-
like
under
lip
,
his
lengthy
white
beard
,
and
a
sort
of
cap
,
covering
his
head
,
which
was
ornamented
with
a
pair
of
horns
,
such
as
are
to
be
seen
in
Michael
Angelo
's
tremendous
statue
of
Moses
.
<EOS>
Balthazar
,
besides
being
the
patrico
of
the
tribe
,
was
its
principal
professor
of
divination
,
and
had
been
the
long
-
tried
and
faithful
minister
of
Barbara
Lovel
,
from
whose
secret
instructions
he
was
supposed
to
have
derived
much
of
his
magical
skill
.
<EOS>
Placing
a
pair
of
spectacles
upon
his
"
prognosticating
nose
,
"
and
unrolling
a
vellum
skin
,
upon
which
strange
characters
were
written
,
Balthazar
,
turning
to
Turpin
,
thus
commenced
in
a
solemn
voice
:
<EOS>
Thou
who
wouldst
our
brother
be
,
Say
how
we
shall
enter
thee?Name
the
name
that
thou
wilt
bearEre
our
livery
thou
wear?"I
<EOS>
see
no
reason
why
I
should
alter
my
designation
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
noviciate
;
"
but
as
popes
change
their
titles
on
their
creation
,
there
can
be
no
objection
to
a
scampsman
following
so
excellent
an
example
.
<EOS>
Let
me
be
known
as
the
Night
Hawk
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>

"
returned
the
hierophant
,
proceeding
to
register
the
name
upon
the
parchment
.
"
<EOS>
Kneel
down
,
"
continued
he
.
<EOS>
After
some
hesitation
,
Turpin
complied
.
<EOS>
"You
must
repeat
the
'
salamon
,
'
or
oath
of
our
creed
,
after
my
dictation
,
"
said
the
patrico
;
and
Turpin
,
signifying
his
assent
by
a
nod
<EOS>
,
Balthazar
propounded
the
following
abjuration
:

<EOS>
repeated
Turpin
,
with
emphasis
.
"Zoroaster
<EOS>
,
"
said
the
patrico
to
the
upright
man
,
"
do
thy
part
of
this
ceremonial
.
<EOS>
"Zoroaster
<EOS>
obeyed
;
and
,
taking
Excalibur
from
the
knight
of
Malta
,
bestowed
a
hearty
thwack
with
the
blade
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
kneeling
highwayman
,
assisting
him
afterwards
to
arise
.
<EOS>
The
inauguration
was
complete
.
<EOS>
"Well
<EOS>
,
"
exclaimed
Dick
,
"
I
'm
glad
it
's
all
over

<EOS>
My
leg
feels
a

stiffish
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
much
given

<EOS>
I

dance

"
saying
which
,
he
began
to
shuffle
upon
the
boards
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
,
"
continued
he
,
"
most
reverend
patrico
,
<EOS>
that
same
'

of
yours

<EOS>
I
could
scarce
swallow
it
all
,
and
it
's
strange
if
it
do
n't
give
me
an
indigestion
.
<EOS>
As
to
you
,
sage
Zory
,
from
the
dexterity
with
which
you
flourish
your
sword
,
I
should
say
you
had
practised
at
court
.
<EOS>
His
majesty
could
scarce
do
the
thing
better
,
when
,
slapping
some
fat
alderman
upon
the
shoulder
<EOS>
,
he
bids
him
arise
Sir
Richard
.
<EOS>
And
now
,

"
added
he
,
glancing
round
,
"
<EOS>
as
I
am
one
of
you
,
let
's
have
a
booze
<EOS>
together
ere
<EOS>
I
depart
,
<EOS>
for
I
do
n't
think
my
stay
will
be
long
in
the
land
of
Egypt
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
suggestion
of
Turpin
was
so
entirely
consonant
to
the
wishes
of
the
assemblage
,
that
it
met
with
universal
approbation
;
and
upon
a
sign
from
Zoroaster
,
some
of
his
followers
departed
in
search
of
supplies
for
the
carousal
.
<EOS>
Zoroaster
leaped
from
the
table
,
and
his
example
was
followed
by
Turpin
,
and
more
leisurely
by
the
patrico
.
<EOS>
It
was
rather
early
in
the
day
for
a
drinking
bout
.
<EOS>
But
the
Canting
Crew
were
not
remarkably
particular
.
<EOS>
The
chairs
were
removed
,
and
the
jingling
of
glasses
announced
the
arrival
of
the
preliminaries
of
the
matutine
symposion
.
<EOS>
Poles
,
canvas
,
and
cords
were
next
brought
;
and
in
almost
as
short
a
space
of
time
as
one
scene
is
substituted
for
another
in
a
theatrical
representation
,
a
tent
was
erected
.
<EOS>
Benches
,
stools
,
and
chairs
appeared
with
equal
celerity
,
and
the
interior
soon
presented
an
appearance
like
that
of
a
booth
at
a
fair
.
<EOS>
A
keg
of
brandy
was
broached
,
and
the
health
of
the
new
brother
quaffed
in
brimmers
.
<EOS>
Our
highwayman
returned
thanks
.
<EOS>
Zoroaster
was
in
the
chair
,
the
knight
of
Malta
acting
as
croupier
.
<EOS>
A
second
toast
was
proposed
—
the
tawny
queen
.
<EOS>
This
was
drunk
with
a
like
enthusiasm
,
and
with
a
like
allowance
of
the
potent
spirit
;
but
as
bumpers
of
brandy
are
not
to
be
repeated
with
impunity
,
it
became
evident
to
the
president
of
the
board
that
he
must
not
repeat
his
toasts
quite
so
expeditiously
.
<EOS>
To
create
a
temporary
diversion
,
therefore
,
he
called
for
a
song
.
<EOS>
The
dulcet
notes
of
the
fiddle
now
broke
through
the
clamor
;
and
,
in
answer
to
the
call
,
Jerry
Juniper
volunteered

Much

A
universal
knocking
of
knuckles
by

was
followed
by
profound
silence

My

I
let
hang
down
my
neck

my

whiskers
grow

sirs;A
purple

<EOS>
I
next
clapped
on
,
a
sword
lagged
to
my

And
mounted
on

Two

were
there
by
my
side

upon
two
little
ponies
,
Decked
out
in
scarlet
uniform
,
as
spruce
as
macaronies;Caparisoned
<EOS>
my
charger
was
,
as
grandly
as

And
o'er
my
long
and

I
wore
a

<EOS>
With
my

<EOS>
The
people
all
flocked
forth
,
amazed
to
see
a
man
<EOS>
so
hairy
,
<EOS>
Oh
I
<EOS>
such
a
sight
had
ne'er
before
been
seen
in
Canterbury!My
flowing
robe
,
my
flowing
beard
,
my
horse
with
flowing
mane
<EOS>
,
sirs!They
stared
—
<EOS>
the
days
of
chivalry
<EOS>
,
they
thought
,
were
come
again
,
sirs!With
my
coal
-
black
beard
,
&

<EOS>
I
told
them
a
long
rigmarole
romance
,
that
did
not
halt
aJot
,
that
they
beheld
in
me
a
real
knight
of
Malta!Tom
<EOS>
à
Becket
had
I
sworn
I
was
,
that
saint
and
martyr
hallowed
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
not
just
as
readily
the
bait
they
would
have
swallowed
.
<EOS>
With
my
coal
-
black
beard
,
&
c
.
<EOS>
I
rode
about
,
and
speechified
,
and
everybody
gullied
,
The
tavern
-
keepers
diddled
,
and
the
magistracy
bullied;Like
puppets
were
the
townsfolk
led
in
that
show
<EOS>
they
call
a
raree;The
Gotham
sages
were
a
joke
to
those
of
Canterbury
.

With

<EOS>
The
theatre
I
next
engaged
,
where
I
addressed
the
crowd
,
sirs
,
And
on
retrenchment
and
reform
I
spouted
long
and
loud
,
sirs;On
tithes
and
on
taxation
I
enlarged
with
skill
and
zeal
,
sirs
,
<EOS>
Who
so
able
as
a
Malta
knight
,
the
malt
tax
to
repeal

sirs

<EOS>
With
my
coal
-
black
beard
,
&

.
<EOS>
As
a
candidate
I
then
stepped
forth
to
represent
their
city
,
And
my
non
-
election
to
that
place
was
certainly
a
pity;For
surely
<EOS>
I
the
fittest
was
,
and
very
proper
<EOS>
,
very
,
To
represent
the
wisdom
and
the
wit
of
Canterbury

With

<EOS>
At
the
trial
of
some
smugglers
next
,
one
thing
I
rather
queer
did
,
And
the
justices
upon
the
bench
I
literally
bearded;For
<EOS>
I
swore
that
I
some
casks
did
see
,
though
proved
as
clear
as
day
,
sirs
,
That
I
happened
at
the
time
to
be
some
fifty
miles
away
,
sirs
.
<EOS>
With
my
coal
-
black
beard
,
&

<EOS>
This
last
assertion
,
I
must
own
,
was
somewhat
of
a
blunder
,
And
for
perjury
indicted
they
compelled
me
to
knock
under;To
<EOS>
my
prosperous
career
this
slight
error
put
a
stop
,
sirs
,
And
thus
crossed
,
the
knight
of
Malta
was
at
length
obliged
to
hop
,
sirs
.
<EOS>
With
his
coal
-
black
beard
,
and
purple
cloak
,
jack
-
boots
,
and
broad

brimmed
castor
,
Good

by
to
the
knight
of
Malta
.
<EOS>
The
knight
sat
down
amidst
the
general
plaudits
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
The
party
,
meanwhile
,
had
been
increased
by
the
arrival
of
Luke
and
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
The
former
,
who
was
in
no
mood
for
revelry
,
refused
to
comply
with
his
grandsire
's
solicitation
to
enter
,
and
remained
sullenly
at
the
door
,
with
his
arms
folded
,
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
Turpin
,
whose
movements
he
commanded
through
the
canvas
aperture
.
<EOS>
The
sexton
walked
up
to
Dick
,
who
was
seated
at
the
post
of
honor
,
and
,
clapping
him
upon
the
shoulder
,
congratulated
him
upon
the
comfortable
position
in
which
he
found
him
.
<EOS>
"Ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
Are
you
there
,
my
old
death's
-
head
on
a
mop

?
"
said
Turpin
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ai
n't
we
merry
mumpers
,
eh
?
<EOS>
Keeping
it
up
in

""What

you
to
a
drop
of
as
fine
Nantz
as
you
ever
tasted
in
your
life

"
said
Zoroaster
.
<EOS>
"I
have
no
sort
of
objection
to
it
,
"
returned
Peter
,
"
provided
you
will
all
pledge
my
toast
.
<EOS>
""That
I
will
,
were
it
old
Ruffin

"
shouted
Turpin
.
<EOS>
"Here
's
to

"
cried
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
the

all

<EOS>
You
wo
n't
refuse
that
toast

Captain
Turpin?""Not
<EOS>
I

"
answered
Dick
;
"
I
owe
the
gallows
no
grudge

<EOS>
If
,
as
Jerry
's
song
says
,
I
must
have
a
'
hearty
choke
and
caper
sauce
'
for
my
breakfast
one
of
these
fine
mornings
,
it
shall
never
be
said
that
I
fell
to
my
meal
without
appetite
,
or
neglected
saying
grace
before
it
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
here
's
Peter
Bradley
's
toast
:
'
The
scragging
post
—
the
three
-
legged
mare
,
'
with
three
times
three
.
"Appropriate
<EOS>
as
this
sentiment
was
,
it
did
not
appear
to
be
so
inviting
to
the
party
as
might
have
been
anticipated
,
and
the
shouts
soon
died
away
.
<EOS>
"They
<EOS>
like
not
the
thoughts
of
the
gallows
,
"
said
Turpin
to
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
More
fools
they
.
<EOS>
A
mere
bugbear
to
frighten
children
,
believe
me
;
and
never
yet
alarmed
a
brave
man
.
<EOS>
The
gallows
,
pshaw
!
<EOS>
One
can
but
die
once
,
and
what
signifies
it
<EOS>
how
,
so
that
it
be
over
quickly
.
<EOS>
I
think
no
more
of
the
last
leap
into
eternity
than
clearing
a
five
-
barred
gate
.
<EOS>
A
rope
's
end
for
it
!
<EOS>
So
let
us
be
merry
,
and
make
the
most
of
our
time
,
and
that
's
true
philosophy
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
can
throw
off
a
rum
chant
,
"
added
he
,
turning
to
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
you
sing
last
night
at
the
hall

<EOS>
Troll
us
a

in

me

added
he
,
addressing
the
knight
of
Malta
,
"
you
may
send
me
a
jorum

your
convenience

<EOS>
"Jerry
<EOS>
handed
the
highwayman
a
pipe
,
together
with
a
tumbler
of
the
beverage
which
the
knight
had
prepared
,
which
he
pronounced
excellent
;
and
while
the
huge
bowl
was
passed
round
to
the
company
,
a
prelude
of
shawms
announced
that
Peter
was
ready
to
break
into
song
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
after
the
symphony
was
ended
,
accompanied
at
intervals
by
a
single
instrument
,
Peter
began
his
melody
,
in
a
key
so
high
,
that
the
utmost
exertions
of
the
shawm

blower
failed
to
approach

prevailed
amongst

<EOS>
Luke
himself
had
been
taken
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
When
Turpin
discovered
him
at
the
door
of
the
tent

and
summoned
him
to
appear
,
he
reluctantly
complied
with
the
request
;
but
when
,
in
a
half
-
bantering
vein
,
Dick
began
to
rally
him
upon
his
pretensions

he
would
most
gladly
have
retreated
,
had
it
been
in
his
power

<EOS>
It
was
then
too
late

<EOS>
He
felt
he
must
stand
the
ordeal

<EOS>
Every
eye
was
fixed
upon
him
with
a
look
of
inquiry

<EOS>
Zoroaster
took
his
everlasting
pipe
from
his
mouth

<EOS>
"This

asked
the
perplexed
Magus

"He

replied
Luke
;
"
I
may
not

it

"This
was
sufficient

<EOS>
There
was
a
wild
hubbub

delight
amongst

Luke

all

"Sir

Jerry

said
Dick
,
who

to
feel
the
influence
of
these

,
"
I

<EOS>
Believe

<EOS>
Sir
Luke
and
I
must

a
little

<EOS>
together
ere
<EOS>
I
take
my

.
<EOS>
Adieu!"And
taking
Luke
by
the
arm
,
he
walked
out
of
the
tent
.
<EOS>
Peter
Bradley
rose
,
and
followed
them
.
<EOS>
At
the
door
they
found
the
dwarfish
Grasshopper
with
Black
Bess
.
<EOS>
Rewarding
the
urchin
for
his
trouble
,
and
slipping
the
bridle
of
his
mare
over
his
hand
,
Turpin
continued
his
walk
over
the
green
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
he
seemed
to
be
lost
in
rumination
.
<EOS>
"I
tell
you
what
,
Sir
Luke
,
"
said
he
;
"
I
should
like
to
do
a
generous
thing
,
and
make
you
a
present
of
this
bit
of
paper
.
<EOS>
But
one
ought
not
to
throw
away
one
's
luck
,
you
know
—
there
is
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
thieves
,
as
the
player
coves
say
,
which
must
be
taken
at
the
flood
,
or
else
——
no
matter
!
<EOS>
Your
old
dad
,
Sir
Piers
—
God
help
him!—had
the
gingerbread
,
that
I
know
;
he
was
,
as
we
say
,
a
regular
rhino
-
cerical
cull
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
feel
a
few
thousands
,
especially
at
starting
;
and
besides
,
there
are
two
others
,
Rust
and
Wilder
,
who
row
in
the
same
boat
with
me
,
and
must
therefore
come
in
for
their
share
of
the
reg'lars
.
<EOS>
All
this
considered
<EOS>
,
you
ca
n't
complain
,
I
think
if
I
ask
five
thousand
for
it
.
<EOS>
That
old
harridan
,
Lady
Rookwood
,
offered
me
nearly
as
much
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
talk
to
you
of
fairness
,
"
said
Luke
;
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
say
that
document
belongs
of
right
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
fell
by
accident
into
your
hands
.
<EOS>
Having
possessed
yourself
of
it
,
I
blame
you
not
that
you
dispose
of
it
to
the
best
advantage
.
<EOS>
I
must
,
perforce
,
agree
to
your
terms
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
no
,
"
replied
Dick
,
"
it
's
quite
optional
;
Lady
Rookwood
will
give
as
much
,
and
make
no
mouths
about
it

<EOS>
I
'll
just

have
ten
minutes
for

.
<EOS>
Who
knows
if
I
may
not
have
come
in
for
a
good
thing
here?"At
that
instant
the
carriage
passed
the
angle
of
a
rock
some
three
hundred
yards
distant
,
and
was
seen
slowly
ascending
the
hill
-
side
.
<EOS>
Eager
as
a
hawk
after
his
quarry
,
Turpin
dashed
after
it
.
<EOS>
In
vain
the
sexton
,
whom
he
nearly
overthrew
in
his
career
,
called
after
him
to
halt
.
<EOS>
He
sped
like
a
bolt
from
the
bow
.
"May
<EOS>
the
devil
break
his
neck
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Peter
,
as
he
saw
him
dash
through
the
brook
;
"
could
he
not
let
them
alone?""This
must
not
be
,
"
said
Luke
;
"
know
you
whose
carriage
<EOS>
it
is?""It
is
a
shrine
that
holds
the
jewel

"
returned
Peter
;
"
haste
,
and
arrest
the
spoiler

hand
.
<EOS>
""Whom
<EOS>
do
you
mean
?
"
asked
Luke
.
<EOS>
"Eleanor

"
replied
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
there

<EOS>
To
the

away
.
<EOS>
""Eleanor

!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Luke—"and
<EOS>
Sybil?——"At
<EOS>
this
instant
<EOS>
a
pistol
-
shot
was
heard
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
you
let
murder
be
done
,
and
upon
your
cousin

"
<EOS>
cried
Peter
,
with
a
bitter
look
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
what
I
took
you
for

<EOS>
"Luke
answered
not
,
but
,
swift
as
the
hound
freed
from
the
leash
,
darted
in
the
direction
of
the
carriage

CHAPTER

<EOS>
ELEANOR
MOWBRAY
——
<EOS>
MischiefsAre
like
the
visits
of
Franciscan
friars
,
They
never
come
to
prey
upon
us
single.—Devil
's
Law
Case
.
<EOS>
THE
course
of
our
tale
returns
now
to
Eleanor
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
After
she
had
parted
from
Ranulph
Rookwood
,
and
had
watched
him
disappear
beneath
the
arches
of
the
church
porch
,
her
heart
sank
,
and
,
drawing
herself
back
within
the
carriage
,
she
became
a
prey
to
the
most
poignant
affliction
.
<EOS>
In
vain
she
endeavored
to
shake
off
this
feeling
of
desolation
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
.
<EOS>
Despair
had
taken
possession
of
her
;
the
magic
fabric
of
delight
melted
away
,
or
only
gleamed
to
tantalize
,
at
an
unreachable
distance
.
<EOS>
A
presentiment
that
Ranulph
would
never
be
hers
had
taken
root
in
her
imagination
,
and
overshadowed
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
While
Eleanor
pursued
this
train
of
reflection
,
the
time
insensibly
wore
away
,
until
the
sudden
stoppage
of
the
carriage
aroused
the
party
from
their
meditation
.
<EOS>
Major
Mowbray
perceived
that
the
occasion
of
the
halt
was
the
rapid
advance
of
a
horseman
,
who
was
nearing
them
at
full
speed
.
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
the
rider
was
somewhat
singular
,
and
might
have
created
some
uneasiness
as
to
the
nature
of
his
approach
,
had
not
the
major
immediately
recognized
a
friend
;
he
was
,
nevertheless
,
greatly
surprised
to
see
him
,
and
turned
to
Mrs.
Mowbray
to
inform
her
that
Father
Ambrose
,
to
his
infinite
astonishment
,
was
coming
to
meet
them
,
and
appeared
,
from
his
manner
,
to
be
the
bearer
of
unwelcome
tidings
.
<EOS>
Father
Ambrose
was
,
perhaps
,
the
only
being
whom
Eleanor
disliked
.
<EOS>
She
had
felt
an
unaccountable
antipathy
towards
him
,
which
she
could
neither
extirpate
nor
control
,
during
their
long
and
close
intimacy
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
necessary
to
mention
that
her
religious
culture
had
been
in
accordance
with
the
tenets
of
the
Romish
Church
,
in
whose
faith
—
the
faith
of
her
ancestry
—
her
mother
had
continued
;
and
that
Father
Ambrose
,
with
whom
she
had
first
become
acquainted
during
the
residence
of
the
family
near
Bordeaux
,
was
her
ghostly
adviser
and
confessor
.
<EOS>
An
Englishman
by
birth
,
he
had
been
appointed
pastor
to
the
diocese
in
which
they
dwelt
,
and
was
,
consequently
,
a
frequent
visitor
,
almost
a
constant
inmate
of
the
château
;
yet
though
duty
and
respect
would
have
prompted
her
to
regard
the
father
with
affection
,
Eleanor
could
never
conquer
the
feelings
of
dislike
and
distrust
which
she
had
at
first
entertained
towards
him
;
a
dislike
which
was
increased
by
the
strange
control
in
which
he
seemed
to
hold
her
mother
,
who
regarded
him
with
a
veneration
approaching
to
infatuation
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
therefore
,
with
satisfaction
that
she
bade
him
adieu
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
however
,
followed
his
friends
to
England
under
a
feigned
name
as
—
being
a
recusant
Romish
priest
,
and
supposed
to
have
been
engaged
in
certain
Jesuitical
plots
,
his
return
to
his
own
country
was
attended
with
considerable
risk
—
,
and
had
now
remained
domesticated
with
them
for
some
months
.
<EOS>
That
he
had
been
in
some
way
,
in
early
life
,
connected
with
a
branch
of
the
house
of
Rookwood
<EOS>
,
Eleanor
was
aware
—
she
fancied
he
might
have
been
engaged
in
political
intrigue
with
Sir
Reginald
,
which
would
have
well
accorded
with
his
ardent
,
ambitious
temperament
—
,
and
the
knowledge
of
this
circumstance
made
her
doubly
apprehensive
lest
the
nature
of
his
present
communication
should
have
reference
to
her
lover
,
towards
whose
cause
the
father
had
never
been
favorable
,
and
respecting
whose
situation
he
might
have
made
some
discovery
,
which
she
feared
he
might
use
to
Ranulph
's
disadvantage
.
<EOS>
Wrapped
in
a
long
black
cloak
,
with
a
broad
-
brimmed
hat
drawn
closely
over
his
brows
,
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
further
of
the
priest
's
figure
and
features
beyond
the
circumstance
of
his
height
,
which
was
remarkable
,
until
he
had
reached
the
carriage
window
,
when
,
raising
his
hat
,
he
disclosed
a
head
that
Titian
might
have
painted
,
and
which
,
arising
from
the
dark
drapery
,
looked
not
unlike
the
visage
of
some
grave
and
saturnine
Venetian
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
venerable
expanse
of
forehead
,
thinly
scattered
with
hair
,
towering
over
black
pent
-
house
-
like
brows
,
which
,
in
their
turn
,
shadowed
keen
penetrating
eyes
;
the
temples
were
hollow
,
and
blue
veins
might
be
traced
beneath
the
sallow
skin
;
the
cheek
-
bones
were
high
,
and
there
was
something
in
the
face
that
spoke
of
self
-
mortification
;
while
the
thin
livid
lips
,
closely
compressed
,
and
the
austere
and
sinister
expression
of
his
countenance
,
showed
that
his
self
-
abasement
,
if
he
had
ever
practised
it
,
had
scarcely
prostrated
the
demon
of
pride
,
whose
dominion
might
still
be
traced
in
the
lines
and
furrows
of
his
haughty
physiognomy
.
<EOS>
The
father
looked
at
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
and
then
glanced
suspiciously
at
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
The
former
appeared
to
understand
him
.
<EOS>
"You
would
say
a
word
to
me
in
private
,
"
said
Mrs.
Mowbray
;
"
shall
I
descend?"The
priest
bowed
assent
.
<EOS>
"It
is
not
to
you
alone
that
my
mission
extends
,
"
said
he
,
gravely
;
"
you
are
all
in
part
concerned
;
your
son
had
better
alight
with
you
.
<EOS>
""Instantly
,
"
replied
the
major
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
give
your
horse
in
charge
to
the
postilion
,
we
will
attend
you
at
once
.
<EOS>
"With
a
feeling
of
renewed
apprehension
,
connected
<EOS>
,
she
knew
not
why
,
with
Ranulph
,
Eleanor
beheld
her
relatives
descend
from
the
carriage
;
and
,
in
the
hope
of
gaining
some
clue
from
their
gestures
to
the
subject
of
their
conversation
,
she
watched
their
motions
as
narrowly
as
her
situation
permitted
.
<EOS>
From
the
earnest
manner
of
the
priest
,
and
the
interest
his
narrative
seemed
to
excite
in
his
hearers
,
it
was
evident
that
his
communication
was
of
importance
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
accompanied
by
Father
Ambrose
,
Mrs.
Mowbray
returned
to
the
carriage
,
while
the
major
,
mounting
the
priest
's
horse
,
after
bidding
a
hasty
adieu
to
his
sister
,
adding
,
with
a
look
that
belied
the
consolation
intended
to
be
conveyed
by
his
words
,
that
"
all
was
well
,
"
but
without
staying
to
offer
her
any
explanation
of
the
cause
of
his
sudden
departure
,
rode
back
the
way
they
had
just
traversed
,
and
in
the
direction
of
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
Bereft
of
the
only
person
to
whom
she
could
have
applied
for
information
,
though
dying
with
curiosity
and
anxiety
to
know
the
meaning
of
this
singular
interview
and
of
the
sudden
change
of
plans
which
she
felt
so
intimately
concerned
herself
,
Eleanor
was
constrained
to
preserve
silence
,
as
,
after
their
entrance
into
the
carriage
,
her
mother
again
seemed
lost
in
painful
reflection
,
and
heeded
her
not
;
and
the
father
,
drawing
from
his
pocket
a
small
volume
,
appeared
intently
occupied
in
its
perusal
.
<EOS>
"Dear
mother
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
at
length
,
turning
to
Mrs.
Mowbray
<EOS>
,
"
my
brother
is
gone——""To
Rookwood
,
"
said
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
in
a
tone
calculated
to
check
further
inquiry
;
but
Eleanor
was
too
anxious
to
notice
it
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
wherefore
,
mother
?
<EOS>
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
May
I
not
be
informed?""Not
as
yet
,
my
child
—
not
as
yet
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
learn
all
sufficiently
early
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
priest
raised
his
cat
-
like
eyes
from
the
book
to
watch
the
effect
of
this
speech
,
and
dropped
them
instantly
as
Eleanor
turned
towards
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
about
to
appeal
to
him
,
but
having
witnessed
this
look
,
she
relinquished
her
scarce
-
formed
purpose
,
and
endeavored
to
divert
her
tristful
thoughts
by
gazing
through
the
glimmering
medium
of
her
tears
upon
the
soothing
aspect
of
external
nature
—
that
aspect
which
,
in
sunshine
or
in
storm
,
has
ever
relief
in
store
for
a
heart
embittered
by
the
stormy
coldness
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
The
road
,
meanwhile
,
led
them
through
a
long
woody
valley
,
and
was
now
climbing
the
sides
of
a
steep
hill
.
<EOS>
They
were
soon
in
the
vicinity
of
the
priory
,
and
of
the
gipsies
'
encampment
.
<EOS>
The
priest
leaned
forward
,
and
whispered
something
in
Mrs.
Mowbray
's
ear
,
who
looked
towards
the
ruined
shrine
,
part
of
the
mouldering
walls
being
visible
from
the
road
.
<EOS>
At
the
moment
the
clatter
of
a
horse
's
hoofs
,
and
the
sound
of
a
loud
voice
,
commanding
the
postilion
,
in
a
menacing
tone
,
to
stop
,
accompanied
by
a
volley
of
imprecations
,
interrupted
the
conference
,
and
bespoke
the
approach
of
an
unwelcome
intruder
,
and
one
whom
all
,
too
truly
,
feared
would
not
be
readily
dismissed
.
<EOS>
The
postilion
did
his
best
to
rid
them
of
the
assailant
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
a
masked
horseman
behind
him
,
approaching
at
a
furious
rate
,
he
had
little
doubt
as
to
his
intentions
,
and
Turpin
,
for
it
was
our
highwayman
,
soon
made
his
doubts
certainties
.
<EOS>
He
hallooed
to
him
to
stop
;
but
the
fellow
paid
no
attention
to
his
command
,
and
disregarded
even
the
pistol
which
he
saw
,
in
a
casual
glimpse
over
his
near
side
,
presented
at
his
person
.
<EOS>
Clapping
spurs
into
his
horse
's
flanks
,
he
sought
succor
in
flight
.
<EOS>
Turpin
was
by
his
side
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
As
the
highwayman
endeavored
to
catch
his
reins
,
the
lad
suddenly
wheeled
the
carriage
right
upon
him
,
and
but
for
the
dexterity
of
Turpin
,
and
the
clever
conduct
of
his
mare
,
would
inevitably
have
crushed
him
against
the
roadside
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
his
left
leg
was
slightly
grazed
.
<EOS>
Irritated
at
this
,
Turpin
fired
over
the
man
's
head
,
and
with
the
butt
-
end
of
the
pistol
felled
him
from
his
seat
.
<EOS>
Startled
by
the
sound
,
and
no
longer
under
the
governance
of
their
rider
,
the
horses
rushed
with
frantic
violence
towards
a
ditch
that
bounded
the
other
side
of
the
highway
,
down
which
the
carriage
was
precipitated
,
and
at
once
overturned
.
<EOS>
Turpin
's
first
act
,
after
he
had
ascertained
that
no
mischief
had
been
occasioned
to
those
within
,
beyond
the
alarm
incident
to
the
shock
,
was
to
compel
the
postilion
,
who
had
by
this
time
gained
his
legs
,
to
release
the
horses
from
their
traces
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
with
the
best
grace
he
could
assume
,
and
,
adjusting
his
mask
,
he
opened
the
carriage
,
and
proceeded
to
liberate
the
captives
.
<EOS>
"Beg
<EOS>
pardon
,
ma'am
,
"
said
he
,
as
soon
as
he
had
released
Mrs.
Mowbray
;
"
excessively
sorry
,
upon
my
soul
,
to
have
been
the
cause
of
so
much
unnecessary
alarm
to
you
—
all
the
fault
,
I
assure
you
,
of
that
rascal
of
a
postilion
;
had
the
fellow
only
pulled
up
when
I
commanded
him
,
this
botheration
might
have
been
avoided
.
<EOS>
You
will
remember
that
,
when
you
pay
him
—
all
his
fault
,
I
assure
you
,
ma'am
.
"Receiving
<EOS>
no
reply
,
he
proceeded
to
extricate
Eleanor
,
with
whose
beauty
the
inflammable
highwayman
was
instantly
smitten
.
<EOS>
Leaving
the
father
to
shift
for
himself
,
he
turned
to
address
some
observation
of
coarse
gallantry
to
her
;
but
she
eluded
his
grasp
,
and
flew
to
her
mother
's
side
.
<EOS>
"It
is
useless
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
as
Turpin
drew
near
them
,
"
to
affect
ignorance
of
your
intentions
.
<EOS>
You
have
already
occasioned
us
serious
alarm
;
much
delay
and
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
I
trust
,
therefore
,
that
beyond
our
purses
,
to
which
,
though
scantily
supplied
,
you
are
welcome
,
we
shall
sustain
no
molestation
.
<EOS>
You
seem
to
have
less
of
the
ruffian
about
you
than
the
rest
of
your
lawless
race
,
and
are
not
,
I
should
hope
,
destitute
of
common
humanity
.
<EOS>
""Common
humanity
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Turpin
:
"
bless
you
,
ma'am
,
<EOS>
I
'm
the
most
humane
creature
breathing
—
would
not
hurt
a
fly
,
much
less
a
lady
.
<EOS>
Incivility
was
never
laid
to
my
charge
.
<EOS>
This
business
may
be
managed
in
a
few
seconds
;
and
as
soon
as
we
have
settled
the
matter
,
I
'll
lend
your
stupid
jack
-
boy
a
hand
to
put
the
horses
to
the
carriage
again
,
and
get
the
wheels
out
of
the
ditch
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
banker
,
ma'am
,
I
suppose
,
in
town
—
perhaps
in
the
country
;
but
I
do
n't
like
country
bankers
;
besides
,
I
want
a
little
ready
cash
in
Rumville
—
beg
pardon
,
ma'am
,
London
<EOS>
I
mean
.
<EOS>
My
ears
have
been
so
stunned
with
those
Romany
patterers
,
I
almost
think
in
flash
.
<EOS>
Just
draw
me
a
check
<EOS>
;
I
've
pen
and
ink
<EOS>
always
ready
:
a
check
for
fifty
pounds
,
ma'am
—
only
fifty
.
<EOS>
What
's
your
banker
's
name
?
<EOS>
I
've
blank
checks
of
all
the
best
houses
in
my
pocket
;
that
and
a
kiss
from
the
pretty
lips
of
that
cherry
-
cheeked
maid
,
"
winking
to
Eleanor
,
"
will
fully
content
me
.
<EOS>
You
see
you
have
neither
an
exorbitant
nor
uncivil
personage
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
"Eleanor
<EOS>
shrank
closer
towards
her
mother
.
<EOS>
Exhausted
by
previous
agitation
of
the
night
,
greatly
frightened
by
the
shock
which
she
had
just
sustained
,
and
still
more
alarmed
by
the
words
and
gestures
of
the
highwayman
<EOS>
,
she
felt
that
she
was
momentarily
in
danger
of
fainting
,
and
with
difficulty
prevented
herself
from
falling
.
<EOS>
The
priest
,
who
had
succeeded
in
freeing
himself
from
the
carriage
,
now
placed
himself
between
Turpin
and
the
ladies
.
<EOS>
"Be
<EOS>
satisfied
,
misguided
man
,
"
said
the
father
,
in
a
stern
voice
,
offering
a
purse
,
which
Mrs.
Mowbray
hastily
extended
towards
him
,
"
with
the
crime
you
have
already
committed
,
and
seek
not
to
peril
your
soul
by
deeper
guilt
;
be
content
with
the
plunder
you
now
obtain
,
and
depart
;
for
,
by
my
holy
calling
,
I
affirm
to
you
,
that
if
you
advance
one
footstep
towards
the
further
molestation
of
these
ladies
,
it
shall
be
at
the
hazard
of
your
life
.
<EOS>
""Bravo
!
"
exclaimed
Turpin
.
<EOS>
"
Now
this
is
what
I
like
;
who
would
have
thought
the
old
autem
-
bawler
had
so
much
pluck
in
him
?
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
commend
you
for
your
courage
,
but
you
are
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
quietest
man
breathing
,
and
never
harm
a
human
being
;
in
proof
of
which
,
only
look
at
your
rascal
of
a
postilion
,
whom
any
one
of
my
friends
would
have
sent
post
-
haste
to
the
devil
for
half
the
trouble
he
gave
me
.
<EOS>
Easy
as
I
am
,
I
never
choose
to
be
balked
in
my
humors
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
the
fifty
and
the
buss
,
and
then
I
'm
off
,
as
soon
as
you
like
;
and
I
may
as
well
have
the
kiss
while
the
old
lady
signs
the
check
,
and
then
we
shall
have
the
seal
as
well
as
the
signature
.
<EOS>
Poh
—
poh
—
no
nonsense
!
<EOS>
Many
a
pretty
lass
has
thought
it
an
honor
to
be
kissed
by
Turpin
.
"Eleanor
<EOS>
recoiled
with
deepest
disgust
,
as
she
saw
the
highwayman
thrust
aside
the
useless
opposition
of
the
priest
,
and
approach
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
removed
his
mask
;
his
face
,
flushed
with
insolent
triumph
,
was
turned
towards
her
.
<EOS>
Despite
the
loathing
,
which
curdled
the
blood
within
her
veins
,
she
could
not
avert
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
drew
near
her
;
she
uttered
a
shrill
scream
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
a
powerful
grasp
was
laid
upon
Turpin
's
shoulder
;
he
turned
and
beheld
Luke
.
<EOS>
"Save
me
!
<EOS>
save
me
,
"
cried
Eleanor
,
addressing
the
new
comer
.
"Damnation
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
highwayman
,
"
what
has
brought
you
here
?
<EOS>
one
would
think
you
were
turned
assistant
to
all
distressed
damsels
.
<EOS>
Quit
your
hold
,
or
,
by
the
God
above
us
,
you
will
repent
it
.
<EOS>
""Fool
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Luke
,
"
talk
thus
to
one
who
heeds
you
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
he
hurled
Turpin
backwards
with
so
much
force
that
,
staggering
a
few
yards
,
the
highwayman
fell
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
The
priest
stood
like
one
stunned
with
surprise
at
Luke
's
sudden
appearance
and
subsequent
daring
action
.
<EOS>
Luke
,
meanwhile
,
approached
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
He
gazed
upon
her
with
curiosity
mixed
with
admiration
,
for
his
heart
told
him
she
was
very
fair
.
<EOS>
A
deathlike
paleness
had
spread
over
her
cheeks
;
yet
still
,
despite
the
want
of
color
,
she
looked
exquisitely
beautiful
,
and
her
large
blue
eyes
eloquently
thanked
her
deliverer
for
her
rescue
.
<EOS>
The
words
she
wanted
were
supplied
by
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
who
thanked
him
in
appropriate
terms
,
when
they
were
interrupted
by
Turpin
,
who
had
by
this
time
picked
himself
up
,
and
was
drawing
near
them
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
wore
a
fierce
expression
.
<EOS>
"I
tell
you
what
,
"
said
he
,
"
Luke
Bradley
,
or
Luke
Rookwood
,
or
whatever
else
you
may
call
yourself
,
you
have
taken
a
damned
unfair
advantage
of
me
in
this
matter
,
and
deserve
nothing
better
at
my
hands
than
that
I
should
call
you
to
instant
account
for
it
—
and
curse
me
,
if
I
do
n't
too
.
<EOS>
""Luke
Bradley
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
<EOS>
Mrs.
Mowbray—"are
you
that
individual?""I
have
been
so
called
,
madam
,
"
replied
Luke
.
<EOS>
"Father
<EOS>
Ambrose
,
is
this
the
person
of
whom
you
spoke
?
"
<EOS>
eagerly
asked
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
I
conclude
,
"
returned
the
priest
,
evasively
.
<EOS>
"Did
<EOS>
he
not
call
you
Luke
Rookwood
?
"
<EOS>
eagerly
demanded
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
Is
that
also
your
name?""Rookwood
is
my
name
,
fair
cousin
,
"
replied
Luke
,
"
if
I
may
venture
to
call
you
so
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
Ranulph
Rookwood
<EOS>
is——""My
brother
.
<EOS>
""I
never
heard
he
had
a
brother
,
"
rejoined
Eleanor
,
with
some
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
that
be?""I
am
his
brother
,
nevertheless
,
"
replied
Luke
,
<EOS>
moodily—"his
ELDER
BROTHER!"Eleanor
turned
to
her
mother
and
the
priest
with
a
look
of
imploring
anguish
;
she
saw
a
confirmation
of
the
truth
of
this
statement
in
their
glances
.
<EOS>
No
contradiction
was
offered
by
either
to
his
statement
;
both
,
indeed
,
appeared
in
some
mysterious
manner
prepared
for
it
.
<EOS>
This
,
then
,
was
the
dreaded
secret
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
cause
of
her
brother
's
sudden
departure
.
<EOS>
The
truth
flashed
with
lightning
swiftness
across
her
brain
.
<EOS>
Chagrined
and
mortified
,
Luke
remarked
that
glance
of
inquiry
.
<EOS>
His
pride
was
hurt
at
the
preference
thus
naturally
shown
towards
his
brother
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
struck
,
deeply
struck
,
with
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
He
acknowledged
the
truth
of
Peter
's
words
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
's
loveliness
was
without
parallel
.
<EOS>
He
had
seen
naught
so
fair
,
and
the
instant
he
beheld
her
,
he
felt
that
for
her
alone
could
he
cancel
his
vows
to
Sybil
.
<EOS>
The
spirit
of
rivalry
and
jealousy
was
instantly
aroused
by
Eleanor
's
exclamations
.
<EOS>
"His
<EOS>
elder
brother
!
"
echoed
Eleanor
,
dwelling
upon
his
words
,
and
addressing
Luke—"then
you
must
be
—
but
<EOS>
no
,
you
are
not
,
you
can
not
be
—
it
is
Ranulph
's
title
—
it
is
not
yours
—
you
are
not——""I
am
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
,
"
replied
Luke
,
proudly
.
<EOS>
Ere
the
words
were
uttered
Eleanor
had
fainted
.
<EOS>
"Assistance
is
at
hand
,
madam
,
if
you
will
accept
it
,
and
follow
me
,
"
said
Luke
,
raising
the
insensible
girl
in
his
arms
,
and
bearing
her
down
the
hill
towards
the
encampment
<EOS>
,
whither
he
was
followed
by
Mrs.
Mowbray
and
the
priest
,
between
whom
,
during
the
hurried
dialogue
we
have
detailed
,
very
significant
glances
had
been
exchanged
.
<EOS>
Turpin
,
who
,
as
it
may
be
supposed
,
had
not
been
an
incurious
observer
of
the
scene
passing
,
burst
into
his
usual
loud
laugh
on
seeing
Luke
bear
away
his
lovely
burden
.
<EOS>
"Cousin
!
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
"
said
he
.
"
<EOS>
So
the
wench
is
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
Damme
,
I
half
suspect
he
has
fallen
in
love
with
his
new
-
found
cousin
;
and
if
so
,
Miss
Sybil
,
or
<EOS>
I
'm
mistaken
,
will
look
as
yellow
as
a
guinea
.
<EOS>
If
that
little
Spanish
devil
gets
it
into
her
pretty
jealous
pate
that
he
is
about
to
bring
home
a
new
mistress
,
we
shall
have
a
tragedy
-
scene
in
the
twinkling
of
a
bed
-
post
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
sha
n't
lose
sight
of
Sir
Luke
until
I
have
settled
my
accounts
with
him
.
<EOS>
Hark
ye
,
boy
,
"
continued
he
,
addressing
the
postilion
;
"
remain
where
you
are
;
you
wo
n't
be
wanted
yet
awhile
,
I
imagine
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
guinea
for
you
,
to
drink
Dick
Turpin
's
health
.
<EOS>
"Upon
<EOS>
which
he
mounted
his
mare
,
and
walked
her
easily
down
the
hill
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
so
that
be
Dick
Turpin
,
folks
talk
so
much
about
,
"
soliloquized
the
lad
,
looking
curiously
after
him
;
"
well
,
he
's
<EOS>
as
civil
-
speaking
a
chap
as
need
be
,
blow
my
boots
if
he
ai
n't
!
<EOS>
and
if
I
'd
had
a
notion
it
were
he
,
I
'd
have
pulled
up
at
first
call
,
without
more
ado
.
<EOS>
Nothing
like
experience
—
I
shall
know
better
another
time
,
"
added
he
,
pocketing
the
douceur
.
<EOS>
Rushing
swiftly
down
the
hill
,
Luke
tarried
at
the
river
's
brink
,
to
sprinkle
some
of
the
cool
element
upon
the
pale
brow
of
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
As
he
held
her
in
his
arms
,
thoughts
which
he
fain
would
have
stifled
in
their
birth
took
possession
of
his
heart
.
"
<EOS>
Would
she
were
mine
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
he
.
"
<EOS>
Yet
no
!
<EOS>
the
wish
is
unworthy
.
"
<EOS>
But
that
wish
returned
unbidden
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
opened
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
was
still
too
weak
to
walk
without
support
,
and
Luke
,
raising
her
once
more
in
his
arms
,
and
motioning
Mrs.
Mowbray
to
follow
,
crossed
the
brook
by
means
of
stepping
-
stones
,
and
conducted
his
charge
along
a
bypath
towards
the
priory
,
so
as
to
avoid
meeting
with
the
crew
assembled
upon
the
green
.
<EOS>
They
had
gained
one
of
the
roofless
halls
,
when
he
encountered
Balthazar
.
<EOS>
Astonished
at
the
sight
of
the
party
,
the
patrico
was
about
to
address
the
priest
as
an
acquaintance
,
when
his
more
orthodox
brother
raised
his
finger
to
his
lips
,
in
token
of
caution
.
<EOS>
The
action
passed
unobserved
.
<EOS>
"Hie
<EOS>
thee
to
Sybil
,
"
said
Luke
to
the
patrico
.
<EOS>
"
Bid
her
haste
hither
.
<EOS>
Say
that
this
maiden
—
that
Miss
Mowbray
is
here
,
and
requires
her
aid
.
<EOS>
Fly
!
<EOS>
I
will
bear
her
to
the
refectory
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
Balthazar
passed
the
priest
,
he
pointed
with
a
significant
glance
towards
a
chasm
in
the
wall
,
which
seemed
to
be
an
opening
to
some
subterraneous
chamber
.
<EOS>
The
father
again
made
a
gesture
of
silence
,
and
Balthazar
hastened
upon
his
mission
.
<EOS>
Luke
led
them
to
the
refectory
.
<EOS>
He
brought
a
chair
for
Eleanor
's
support
;
but
so
far
from
reviving
,
after
such
attention
as
could
be
afforded
her
,
she
appeared
to
become
weaker
.
<EOS>
He
was
about
to
issue
forth
in
search
of
Sybil
,
when
to
his
surprise
he
found
the
door
fastened
.
<EOS>
"You
can
not
pass
this
way
,
"
said
a
voice
,
which
Luke
instantly
recognized
as
that
of
the
knight
of
Malta
.
<EOS>
"Not
pass
!
"
echoed
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
What
does
this
mean?""Our
orders
are
from
the
queen
,
"
returned
the
knight
.
<EOS>
At
this
instant
the
low
tone
of
a
muffled
bell
was
heard
.
<EOS>
"Ha
<EOS>
!
"
exclaimed
Luke
;
"
some
danger
is
at
hand
.
<EOS>
"His
<EOS>
heart
smote
him
as
he
thought
of
Sybil
,
and
he
looked
anxiously
towards
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
Balthazar
rushed
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
"Where
<EOS>
is
Sybil
?
"
cried
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Will
she
not
come?""She
will
be
here
anon
,
"
answered
the
patrico
.
<EOS>
"I
will
seek
her
myself
,
then
,
"
said
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
The
door
by
which
you
entered
is
free
.
<EOS>
""It
is
not
free
,
"
replied
Balthazar
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Remain
where
you
are
.
<EOS>
""Who
will
prevent
my
going
forth
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Luke
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
will
,
"
said
Barbara
Lovel
,
as
she
suddenly
appeared
in
the
doorway
.
<EOS>
"
You
stir
not
,
excepting
at
my
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Where
is
the
maiden
?
"
<EOS>
continued
she
,
looking
around
with
a
grim
smile
of
satisfaction
at
the
consternation
produced
by
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
I
see
;
she
faints
.
<EOS>
Here
is
a
cordial
that
shall
revive
her
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
you
are
welcome
to
the
gipsies
'
dwelling
—
you
and
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
And
you
,
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
,
I
congratulate
you
upon
your
accession
of
dignity
.
<EOS>
"
Turning
to
the
priest
,
who
was
evidently
overwhelmed
with
confusion
,
she
exclaimed
,
"
<EOS>
And
you
too
,
sir
,
think
you
<EOS>
I
recognize
you
not
?
<EOS>
We
have
met
ere
this
,
at
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
Know
you
not
<EOS>
Barbara
Lovel
?
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
It
is
long
since
my
poor
dwelling
has
been
so
highly
honored
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
not
delay
the
remedy
.
<EOS>
Let
her
drink
of
this
,
"
said
she
,
handing
a
phial
to
Mrs.
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
instantly
restore
her
.
<EOS>
""It
is
poison
,
"
cried
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
She
shall
not
drink
it
.
<EOS>
""Poison
!
"
reiterated
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"
Behold
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
drank
of
the
liquid
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
poison
your
bride
,
"
added
she
,
turning
to
Luke
.
<EOS>
"My
bride
!
"
echoed
Luke
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
your
bride
,
"
repeated
Barbara
.
<EOS>
Luke
recoiled
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Mowbray
almost
felt
inclined
to
believe
she
was
a
dreamer
,
so
visionary
did
the
whole
scene
appear
.
<EOS>
A
dense
crowd
of
witnesses
stood
at
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
Foremost
amongst
them
was
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
a
shriek
was
heard
,
and
the
crowd
opening
to
allow
her
passage
,
Sybil
rushed
forward
.

<EOS>
MRS

MOWBRAYWell
,
go
thy
ways
,
old
Nick
Machiavel
<EOS>
,
there
will
never
be
the
peer
of
thee
for
wholesome
policy
and
good
counsel
:
<EOS>
thou
took'st
pains
to
chalk
men
out
the
dark
paths
and
hidden
plots
of
murther
and
deceit
,
and
no
man
has
the
grace
to
follow
thee
.
<EOS>
The
age
is
unthankful
,
thy
principles
are
quite
forsaken
,
and
worn
out
of
memory.—Shakerley

Antiquary

<EOS>
SYBIL
'S
sudden
entrance
filled
the
group
that
surrounded
Miss
Mowbray
with
new
dismay
.
<EOS>
But
she
saw
them
not
.
<EOS>
Her
soul
seemed
riveted
by
Eleanor
,
towards
whom
she
rushed
;
and
while
her
eye
wandered
over
her
beauty
,
she
raised
the
braided
hair
from
her
brow
,
revealing
the
clear
,
polished
forehead
.
<EOS>
Wonder
,
awe
,
devotion
,
pity
,
usurped
the
place
of
hatred
.
<EOS>
The
fierce
expression
that
had
lit
up
her
dark
orbs
was
succeeded
by
tender
commiseration
.
<EOS>
She
looked
an
imploring
appeal
at
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
ay
,
"
returned
the
old
gipsy
,
extending
at
the
same
time
the
phial
;
"
I
understand
.
<EOS>
Here
is
that
will
bring
the
blood
once
more
into
her
pallid
cheeks
,
and
kindle
the
fire
within
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
Give
her
of
this
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
effect
of
the
potion
was
almost
instantaneous
,
amply
attesting
Barbara
's
skill
in
its
concoction
.
<EOS>
Stifled
respiration
first
proclaimed
Eleanor
's
recovery
.
<EOS>
She
opened
her
large
and
languid
eyes
;
her
bosom
heaved
almost
to
bursting
;
her
pulses
throbbed
quickly
and
feverishly
;
and
as
the
stimulant
operated
,
the
wild
lustre
of
excitement
blazed
in
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
Sybil
took
her
hand
to
chafe
it
.
<EOS>
The
eyes
of
the
two
maidens
met
.
<EOS>
They
gazed
upon
each
other
steadfastly
and
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
knew
not
whom
she
regarded
,
but
she
could
not
mistake
that
look
of
sympathy
;
she
could
not
mistake
the
tremulous
pressure
of
her
hand
;
she
felt
the
silent
trickling
tears
.
<EOS>
She
returned
the
sympathizing
glance
,
and
gazed
with
equal
wonder
upon
the
ministering
fairy
,
for
such
she
almost
seemed
,
that
knelt
before
her
.
<EOS>
As
her
looks
wandered
from
the
kindly
glance
of
Sybil
to
the
withered
and
inauspicious
aspect
of
the
gipsy
queen
,
and
shifted
thence
to
the
dusky
figures
of
her
attendants
,
filled
with
renewed
apprehension
,
she
exclaimed
,
"
Who
are
these
,
and
where
am
I?""You
are
in
safety
,
"
replied
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
ruined
priory
of
St.
Francis
;
and
those
strange
personages
are
a
horde
of
gipsies
.
<EOS>
You
need
fear
no
injury
from
them
.
<EOS>
""My
deliverer
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
Eleanor
;
when
all
at
once
the
recollection
that
he
had
avowed
himself
a
Rookwood
,
and
the
elder
brother
of
Ranulph
,
flashed
across
her
memory
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Gipsies
!
<EOS>
did
you
not
say
these
people
were
gipsies
?
<EOS>
Your
own
attire
is
the
same
as
theirs
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
,
can
not
be
,
the
brother
of
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
boast
the
same
mother
,
"
returned
Luke
,
proudly
,
"
but
my
father
was
Sir
Piers
Rookwood
,
and
I
am
his
elder
born
.
<EOS>
"He
turned
away
.
<EOS>
Dark
thoughts
swept
across
his
brain
.
<EOS>
Maddened
by
the
beauty
of
Eleanor
,
stung
by
her
slights
,
and
insensible
to
the
silent
agony
of
Sybil
,
who
sought
in
vain
to
catch
his
eye
,
he
thought
of
nothing
but
of
revenge
,
and
the
accomplishment
of
his
purposes
.
<EOS>
All
within
was
a
wild
and
fearful
turmoil
.
<EOS>
His
better
principles
were
stifled
by
the
promptings
of
evil
.
<EOS>
"
Methinks
,
"
cried
he
,
half
aloud
,
"
if
the
Tempter
were
near
to
offer
the
maiden
to
me
,
even
at
the
peril
of
my
soul
's
welfare
,
I
could
not
resist
it
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Tempter
was
at
hand
.
<EOS>
He
is
seldom
absent
on
occasions
like
the
present
.
<EOS>
The
sexton
stood
beside
his
grandson
.
<EOS>
Luke
started
.
<EOS>
He
eyed
Peter
from
head
to
foot
,
almost
expecting
to
find
the
cloven
foot
,
supposed
to
be
proper
to
the
fiend
.
<EOS>
Peter
grinned
in
ghastly
derision
.
"Soh
!
<EOS>
you
would
summon
hell
to
your
aid
;
and
lo
!
<EOS>
the
devil
is
at
your
elbow
.
<EOS>
Well
,
she
is
yours
.
<EOS>
""Make
<EOS>
good
your
words
,
"
cried
Luke
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"Softly
—
softly
,
"
returned
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Moderate
yourself
,
and
your
wishes
shall
be
accomplished
.
<EOS>
Your
own
desires
chime
with
those
of
others
;
nay
,
with
those
of
Barbara
.
<EOS>
She
would
we
d
you
to
Miss
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
You
stare
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
cover
for
some
deeper
plot
;
no
matter
.
<EOS>
It
shall
go
hard
,
despite
her
cunning
,
if
I
foil
her
not
at
her
own
weapons
.
<EOS>
There
is
more
mischief
in
that
old
woman
's
brain
than
was
ever
hatched
within
the
crocodile
's
egg
;
yet
she
shall
find
her
match
.
<EOS>
Do
not
thwart
her
;
leave
all
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
is
about
it
now
,
"
added
he
,
<EOS>
noticing
Barbara
and
Mrs.
Mowbray
in
conference
together
.
<EOS>
"
Be
patient
—
I
will
watch
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
quitted
his
grandson
for
the
purpose
of
scanning
more
closely
the
manoeuvres
of
the
old
gipsy
.
<EOS>
Barbara
,
meanwhile
,
had
not
remained
inactive
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
need
fear
no
relapse
in
your
daughter
;
I
will
answer
for
that
,
"
said
the
old
gipsy
to
Mrs.
Mowbray
;
"
Sybil
will
tend
her
.
<EOS>
Quit
not
the
maiden
's
side
,
"
continued
she
,
addressing
her
grandchild
,
adding
,
in
a
whisper
,
"
Be
cautious
—
alarm
her
not
—
mine
eye
will
be
upon
you
—
drop
not
a
word
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
she
shuffled
to
a
little
distance
with
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
keeping
Sybil
in
view
,
and
watching
every
motion
,
as
the
panther
watches
the
gambols
of
a
fawn
.
<EOS>
"Know
you
who
speaks
to
you
?
"
said
the
old
crone
,
in
the
peculiar
low
and
confidential
tone
assumed
by
her
tribe
to
strangers
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
forgotten
the
name
of
Barbara
Lovel?""I
<EOS>
have
no
distinct
remembrance
of
it
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
"Think
<EOS>
again
,
"
said
Barbara
;
"
and
though
years
are
flown
,
you
may
perchance
recall
the
black
gipsy
woman
,
who
,
when
you
were
surrounded
with
gay
gallants
,
with
dancing
plumes
,
perused
your
palm
,
and
whispered
in
your
ear
the
favored
suitor
's
name
.
<EOS>
Bide
with
me
a
moment
,
madam
,
"
said
Barbara
,
seeing
that
Mrs.
Mowbray
shrank
from
the
recollection
thus
conjured
up
;
"
I
am
old
—
very
old
;
I
have
survived
the
shows
of
flattery
,
and
being
vested
with
a
power
over
my
people
,
am
apt
,
perchance
,
to
take
too
much
upon
myself
with
others
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
old
gipsy
paused
here
,
and
then
,
assuming
a
more
familiar
tone
,
exclaimed
,
"
The
estates
of
Rookwood
are
ample——""Woman
<EOS>
,
what
mean
you?""They
should
have
been
yours
,
lady
,
and
would
have
been
,
but
for
that
marriage
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
beseemed
them
bravely
.
<EOS>
Sir
Reginald
was
wilful
,
and
erased
the
daughter
's
name
to
substitute
that
of
his
son
.
<EOS>
Pity
it
is
that
so
fair
a
creature
as
Miss
Mowbray
should
lack
the
dower
<EOS>
her
beauty
and
her
birth
entitle
her
to
expect
.
<EOS>
Pity
that
Ranulph
Rookwood
should
lose
his
title
,
at
the
moment
when
he
deemed
it
was
dropping
into
his
possession
.
<EOS>
Pity
that
those
broad
lands
should
pass
away
from
you
and
your
children
,
as
they
will
do
,
if
Ranulph
and
Eleanor
are
united
.
<EOS>
""They
never
shall
be
united
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"'Twere
<EOS>
indeed
to
we
d
your
child
to
beggary
,
"
said
Barbara
.
<EOS>
Mrs
.
Mowbray
sighed
deeply
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
is
a
way
,
"
continued
the
old
crone
,
in
a
deep
whisper
,
"
by
which
the
estates
might
still
be
hers
and
yours
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
!
"
said
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
Piers
Rookwood
had
two
sons
.
<EOS>
""Ha!""The
elder
is
here
.
<EOS>
""Luke
—
<EOS>
Sir
Luke
.
<EOS>
He
brought
us
hither
.
<EOS>
""He
loves
your
daughter

<EOS>
I
saw
his
gaze
of
passion
just
now
.
<EOS>
I
am
old
now
,
but
I
have
some
skill
in
lovers

glances
.
<EOS>
Why
not
we
d
her
to
him
?
<EOS>
I
read
hands
—
read
hearts
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
They
were
born
for
each
other
.
<EOS>
Now
,
madam
,
do
you
understand
me?""But
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
with
hesitation
,
"
though
I
might
wish
for
—
though
I
might
sanction
this
,
Eleanor
is
betrothed
to
Ranulph
—
she
loves
him
.
<EOS>
""Think
not
of
her
,
if
you
are
satisfied

<EOS>
She
can
not
judge
so
well
for
herself
as
you
can
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
child
,
and
knows
not
what
she
loves
.
<EOS>
Her
affection
will
soon
be
Luke
's
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
noble
youth
—
the
image
of
his
grandfather
,
your
father
,
Sir
Reginald
;
and
if
your
daughter
be
betrothed
to
any
one
,
'
twas
to
the
heir
of
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
That
was
an
essential
part
of
the
contract
.
<EOS>
Why
should
the
marriage
not
take
place
at
once
,
and
here?""Here
!
<EOS>
How
were
that
possible?""You
are
within
sacred
walls

will
take
you

""To

you
allude

"
asked
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
with
anxiety
.
<EOS>
"To

Piers

Bradley

returned
Barbara

That
priest
united
them
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
!
<EOS>
He
never
told
me
this
.
<EOS>
""He
dared
not
do
so
;
he
had
an
oath
which
bound
him
to
concealment
.
<EOS>
The
time
is
coming
when
greater
mysteries
will
be
revealed
.
<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
strange
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
heard
of
this
before
,
"
said
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
musingly
;
"
and
yet
I
might
have
guessed
as
much
from
his
obscure
hints
respecting
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
I
see
it
all
now
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
gulf
into
which
I
might
have
been
plunged
;
but
I
am
warned
in
time

"
continued
she
,
to
the
priest
,
who
was
pacing
the
chamber
at
some
little
distance
from
them
,
"
is
it
true
that
my
brother
was
wedded
by
you
to
Susan
Bradley?"Ere
the
priest
could
reply
the
sexton
presented
himself
.
<EOS>
"Ha
,
the
very
father
of
the
girl
!
"
said
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
"
whom
I
met
within
our
family
vault
,
and
who
was
so
strangely
moved
when
I
spoke
to
him
of
Alan
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
Is
he
here
likewise?""Alan
Rookwood
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Barbara
,
upon
whom
a
light
seemed
suddenly
to
break
;
"
ha

<EOS>
what
said
he
of
him?""Ill

interposed
Peter

fiercely
,
"

<EOS>
""The

echoed
Barbara
,
with
a
chuckling
laugh
;
"

<EOS>

<EOS>
Twas
a
foul

I

there
was

<EOS>
Blood
flowed
—
blood——""Silence

<EOS>
thundered
Peter
,
"

have
thee
burned

practisest

Beware

"
added
he
,
in
a
deep
tone—"I

<EOS>
"Barbara
's
withered
countenance
exhibited
for
an
instant
the
deepest
indignation
at
the
sexton
's
threat
.
<EOS>
The
malediction
trembled
on
her
tongue
;
she
raised
her
staff
to
smite
him
,
but
she
checked
the
action
.
<EOS>
In
the
same
tone
,
and
with
a
sharp
,
suspicious
look
,
she
replied
,
"
My

thou

<EOS>
See
that
it
prove
so

"And
,
with
a
malignant
scowl
,
the
gipsy
queen
slowly
shuffled
towards
her
satellites

were
stationed
at

ELEANOR
MOWBRAY
had
witnessed
her
mother
's
withdrawal
from
her
side
with
much
uneasiness
,
and
was
with
difficulty
prevented
by
Sybil
from
breaking
upon
her
conference
with
the
gipsy
queen
.
<EOS>
Barbara
's
dark
eye
was
fixed
upon
them
during
the
whole
of
the
interview
,
and
communicated
an
indefinite
sense
of
dread
to
Eleanor
.
"Who
<EOS>
—
who
is
that
old
woman
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Eleanor
,
under
her
breath
.
"
<EOS>
Never
,
even
in
my
wildest
dreams
,
have
I
seen
aught
so
terrible
.
<EOS>
Why
does
she
look
so
at
us
?
<EOS>
She
terrifies
me
;
and
yet
she
can
not
mean
me
ill
,
or
my
mother
—
we
have
never
injured
her?""Alas
!
"
<EOS>
sighed
Sybil
.
<EOS>
"You
sigh
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Eleanor
,
in
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
real
danger
,
then
?
<EOS>
Help
us
to
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
Quick
,
warn
my
mother
;
she
seems
agitated
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
let
me
go
to
her
.
<EOS>
""Hush
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Sybil
,
maintaining
an
unmoved
demeanor
under
the
lynx
-
like
gaze
of
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"
Stir
not
,
as
you
value
your
life
;
you
know
not
where
you
are
,
or
what
may
befall
you
.
<EOS>
Your
safety
depends
upon
your
composure
.
<EOS>
Your
life
is
not
in
danger
;
but
what
is
dearer
than
life
,
your
love
,
is
threatened
with
a
fatal
blow
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
dark
design
to
we
d
you
to
another

<EOS>
""Heavens
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Eleanor
,
"
and
to
whom?""To
Sir
Luke
Rookwood

<EOS>
""I

<EOS>
Marry

me
to
it!""Could
you
not

him?""Love
him

<EOS>
I
have
only
seen
him
within
this
hour

<EOS>
I
knew
not
of
his
existence

<EOS>
He
rescued
me
from
peril

<EOS>
I
would
thank
him

<EOS>
I
would
love
him
,
if
I
could
,
for
Ranulph
's

;
and
yet
for
Ranulph
's
sake
<EOS>
I
hate
him

<EOS>
""Speak
<EOS>
not
of
him
thus
to
me

"
said
Sybil
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
love
him
not

I
love
him

<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
forgive
me

lady
;
pardon
my
impatience
—
my
heart
is
breaking
,

it
has
not
ceased
to
beat
for
him

You
say
you
will
die
sooner

consent
to
this
forced
union

Your
faith
shall
not

so
cruelly
attested

there
must

I
will
be

Be

as
happy
as
I
am
wretched

<EOS>
You
shall
see
what
the
love
of
a
gipsy
can
do
.
<EOS>
"As
she
spoke
,
Sybil
burst
into
a
flood
of
passionate
tears
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
regarded
her
with
the
deepest
commiseration
;
but
the
feeling
was
transient
;
for
Barbara
,
now
advancing
,
exclaimed
:
"
Hence
to
your
mother
.
<EOS>
The
bridegroom
is
waiting
:
to
your
mother

girl

"
<EOS>
And
she
motioned
Eleanor
fiercely
away
.
<EOS>
"
What
means
this
?
"
continued
the
old
gipsy
.
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
said
to
that
girl
?
<EOS>
Did
I
not
caution
you
against
speech
with
her
?
<EOS>
and
you
have
dared
to
disobey
me

<EOS>
You
,
my
grandchild

the
daughter
of
my
Agatha

with
whom
my
slightest
wish

I

<EOS>
I
curse
you!""Oh

<EOS>
cried
Sybil
.

"
Add
not
to
my
despair

<EOS>
""Then
follow
my
advice
implicitly

Cast
off

weakness

all
is
in

<EOS>
Take

place
it
within

When
all
is
over

I

<EOS>
Are

prepared

<EOS>
Shall

set
out?""I
<EOS>

"
replied
Sybil
,
in
accents
hollow
as
despair
;
"
but
let
me
speak
with
Luke
before
we
go
.
<EOS>
""Be

""'Tis

replied
Sybil
,
as
she
departed
in
the
direction
of
Luke
.
<EOS>
Barbara
watched
her
join
him
,
and
then
turned
shortly
towards
Mrs.
Mowbray
and
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
"You
are
ill
,
dear
Luke

"
said
Sybil
,
who
had
silently
approached
her
faithless
lover
;
"
very
ill

<EOS>
""Ill

Luke

breaking
into
frantic
laughter

There

you

You
looked
just
now

continued
she
in
an
altered

have
I
mistaken

Did

utter

"Luke
averted
his
head
.
"Enough

<EOS>
continued
Sybil
,
in
a
voice
of
agony
;
"
I

asked
Luke
,
without
daring
to
regard
her
.
<EOS>
"FOR

EVER

"
answered
Sybil
.
<EOS>
Before
her
lover
could
reply
,
she
shot
from
his
side
,
and
plunging
amidst
the
dark
and
dense
assemblage
near
the
door
,
disappeared
from
view
.
<EOS>
An
instant
after
,
she
emerged
into
the
open
air
.
<EOS>
She
stood
within
the
roofless
hall
.
<EOS>
It
was
filled
with
sunshine
—
with
the
fresh
breath
of
morn
.
<EOS>
The
ivied
ruins
,
the
grassy
floor
,
the
blue
vault
of
heaven
,
seemed
to
greet
her
with
a
benignant
smile
.
<EOS>
All
was
riant
and
rejoicing
—
all
,
save
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Amid
such
brightness
,
her
sorrow
seemed
harsh
and
unnatural
;
as
she
felt
the
glad
influence
of
day
,
she
was
scarcely
able
to
refrain
from
tears
.
<EOS>
It
was
terrible
to
leave
this
beautiful
world
,
that
blue
sky
,
that
sunshine
,
and
all
she
loved
—
so
young
,
so
soon
.
<EOS>
Entering
a
low
arch
that
yawned
within
the
wall
,
she
vanished
like
a
ghost
at
the
approach
of
morn
.

In

she
rushed
to
her
mother
,
and
,
flinging
her
arms
wildly
round
her
neck
,
besought
her
to
protect
her
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Mowbray
gazed
anxiously
upon
the
altered
countenance
of
her
daughter
,
but
a
few
moments
relieved
her
from
much
of
her
uneasiness.—The
expression
of
pain
gradually
subsided
,
and
the
look
of
vacuity
was
succeeded
by
one
of
frenzied
excitement

<EOS>
A
film
had

for
an

her
eyes

the
smile
was
singular
;
it
was
not
the
playful
,
pleasurable
lighting
up
of
the
face
that
it
used
to
be
;
but
it
was
a
smile
,
and
the
mother
's
heart
was
satisfied
.
<EOS>
Mrs
.
Mowbray
knew
not
to
what
circumstance
she
could
attribute
this
wondrous
change
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
the
priest
.
<EOS>
He
was
more
apt
in
divining
the
probable
cause
of
the
sudden
alteration
in
Eleanor
's
manner
.
<EOS>
"What
if
she
has
swallowed
a
love
-
powder
?
"
said
he
,
approaching
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
and
speaking
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
of
such
abominable
mixtures
;
indeed
,
the
holy
St.
Jerome
himself
relates
an
instance
of
similar
sorcery
,
in
his
life
of
Hilarius
;
and
these
people
are
said
to
compound
them
.
<EOS>
""It
may
be
so
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
the
peculiar
softness
in
the
eye
is
more
than
natural
.
<EOS>
""I
will
at
least
hazard
an
experiment
,
to
attest
the
truth
or
fallacy
of
my
supposition
,
"
returned
the
father
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
see
your
destined
bridegroom
yonder
?
"
continued
he
,
addressing
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
She
followed
with
her
eyes
in
the
direction
which
Father
Ambrose
pointed
.
<EOS>
She
beheld
Luke
.
<EOS>
We
know
not
how
to
describe
the
sensations
which
now
possessed
her
.
<EOS>
She
thought
not
of
Ranulph
;
or
,
if
she
did
,
it
was
with
vague
indifference
.
<EOS>
Wrapped
in
a
kind
of
mental
trance
,
she
yielded
to
the
pleasurable
impulse
that
directed
her
unsettled
fancies
towards
Luke
.
<EOS>
For
some
moments
she
did
not
take
her
eyes
from
him
.
<EOS>
The
priest
and
Mrs.
Mowbray
watched
her
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Nothing
passed
between
the
party
till
Luke
joined
them
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
continued
gazing
at
him
,
and
the
seeming
tenderness
of
her
glance
emboldened
Luke
to
advance
towards
her
.
<EOS>
The
soft
fire
that
dwelt
in
those
orbs
was
,
however
,
cold
as
the
shining
wing
of
the
luciola
.
<EOS>
Luke
approached
her
;
he
took
her
hand
—
she
withdrew
it
not
.
<EOS>
He
kissed
it
.
<EOS>
Still
she
withdrew
it
not
,
but
gazed
at
him
with
gently
-
glimmering
eyes
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
daughter
is
yours
,
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
,
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
"What
says
the
maid
herself
?
"
asked
Luke
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
answered
not
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
still
fixed
on
him
.
<EOS>
"She
will
not
refuse
me
her
hand
,
"
said
Luke
.
<EOS>
The
victim
resisted
not
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
the
subterranean
shrine
,
"
cried
Barbara
.
<EOS>
And
she
gave
the
preconcerted
signal
to
the
band
.
<EOS>
The
signal
was
repeated
by
the
gipsy
crew
.
<EOS>
We
may
here
casually
note
,
that
the
crew
had
been
by
no
means
uninterested
or
silent
spectators
of
passing
events
,
but
had
,
on
the
contrary
,
indulged
themselves
in
a
variety
of
conjectures
as
to
their
probable
issue
.
<EOS>
Several
bets
were
pending
as
to
whether
it
would
be
a
match
or
not
after
all
.
<EOS>
Zoroaster
took
long
odds
that
the
match
was
off
—
offering
a
bean
to
half
-
a
-
quid
—
in
other
words
,
a
guinea
to
a
half
-
guinea
—
that
Sybil
would
be
the
bride
.
<EOS>
His
offer
was
taken
at
once
by
Jerry
Juniper
,
and
backed
by
the
knight
of
Malta
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
there
's
the
signal
,
"
cried
the
knight
;
"
I
'll
trouble
you
for
the
bean
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
,
"
added
Jerry
Juniper
,
"
for
another
.
<EOS>
""See
<EOS>
'em
fairly
spliced
first
,
"
replied
the
Magus
;
"
that
's
vot
I
betted
.
<EOS>
""Vell

<EOS>
a
few
minutes

<EOS>
Avay

<EOS>
Mind
and
obey

.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
ay
,
"
answered
the
crew
.
<EOS>
"Here
's
a
torch
for
the
altar
of
Hymen
,
"
said
the
knight
,
flashing
his
torch
in
the
eyes
of
the
patrico
as
he
passed
him
.
<EOS>
"For
<EOS>
the
halter
of
Haman
,
you
might
say
,
"
returned
Balthazar
,
sulkily
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
well
if
some
of
us
do
n't
swing
for
it
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
n't
say
,
"
rejoined
the
perplexed
Magus
,
"
swing
!
<EOS>
Egad
<EOS>
I
fear
it
's
a
ticklish
business
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
no
fighting
shy
,
I
fear
,
with
Barbara
present
;
and
then
there
's
that
infernal
autem
-
bawler
;
it
will
be
so
cursedly
regular
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
done
the
job
,
Balty
,
it
would
not
have
signified
a
brass
farden
.
<EOS>
Luckily
there
will
be
no
vitnesses
to
snitch
upon
us
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
no
one
in
the
vault
besides
ourselves
.
<EOS>
""There
will
be
a
silent
and
a
solemn
witness
,
"
returned
Balthazar
,
"
and
one
whom
you
expect
not
.
<EOS>
""Eh
!
<EOS>
Vot
's
that
you
say
?
<EOS>
a
spy?"But
the
patrico
was
gone
.
<EOS>
"Make
<EOS>
way
there
—
make
way
,
pals
,
for
the
bride
and
bridegroom
,
"
cried
the
knight
of
Malta
,
drawing
Excalibur
,
and
preparing
to
lead
the
way
to
the
vault
.
<EOS>
The
train
began
to
move
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
leaned
upon
the
arm
of
her
mother
.
<EOS>
Beside
them
stalked
Barbara
,
with
an
aspect
of
triumph
.
<EOS>
Luke
followed
with
the
priest
.
<EOS>
One
by
one
<EOS>
the
assemblage
quitted
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
The
sexton
alone
lingered
.
<EOS>
"
The
moment
is
at
hand
,
"
said
he
,
musingly
,
"
when
all
shall
be
consummated
.
<EOS>
"A
<EOS>
few
steps
brought
him
into
the
court
.
<EOS>
The
crowd
was
there
still
.
<EOS>
A
brief
delay
had
taken
place
.
<EOS>
The
knight
of
Malta
then
entered
the
mouth
of
the
vault
.
<EOS>
He
held
his
torch
so
as
to
reveal
a
broken
flight
of
steps
,
conducting
,
it
would
seem
,
to
regions
of
perpetual
night
.
<EOS>
So
thought
Eleanor
,
as
she
shudderingly
gazed
into
the
abyss
.
<EOS>
She
hesitated
;
she
trembled
;
she
refused
.
<EOS>
But
her
mother
's
entreaties
,
and
Barbara
's
threatening
looks
,
induced
,
in
the
end
,
reluctant
compliance
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
place
was
empty
.
<EOS>
Peter
was
about
to
follow
,
when
the
sound
of
a
horse
's
hoofs
broke
upon
his
ear
.
<EOS>
He
tarried
for
an
instant
,
and
the
mounted
figure
of
the
highwayman
burst
within
the
limits
of
the
court
.
<EOS>
"Ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>

earthworm

"
cried
Dick
,
"

Nestor

the
churchyard

<EOS>
Where

gone

<EOS>
Where
's
Sir
Luke

his

hastily
explained
.
<EOS>
"A

""You

"May

<EOS>
""Hanged

returned
Peter
;
"
but
I

not

<EOS>
Stay

You

<EOS>
Ranulph

Major
Mowbray
are
expected
here

<EOS>
""The

have
not

<EOS>
In

<EOS>
Have
you

<EOS>
""Sir

's
a
pipe

shrill
as

call
.
<EOS>
""If
it
will
summon
you
to
our
assistance

,
'
tis
all

<EOS>
May
we

did
Dick
Turpin
desert
his
friends
?
<EOS>
Anywhere
on
this
side
the
Styx
<EOS>
the
sound
of
that
whistle
will
reach
me
.
<EOS>
I
'll
ride
about
the
court
,
and
stand
sentry
.
<EOS>
""Enough
,
"
replied
the
sexton
,
as
he
dived
under
ground
.
<EOS>
"Take
<EOS>
care
of
your
shins
,
"
shouted
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
cursed
ugly
turn
,
but
he
's
used
to
the
dark
.
<EOS>
A
surprise
,
eh
!
<EOS>
I
'll
just
give
a
look
to
my
snappers
—
flints
all
safe
.
<EOS>
Now
I
'm
ready
for
them
,
come
when
they
like
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
having
made
the
circuit
of
the
place
,
he
halted
near
the
mouth
of
the
subterranean
chapel
,
to
be
within
hearing
of
Peter
's
whistle
,
and
,
throwing
his
right
leg
lazily
over
his
saddle
,
proceeded
coolly
to
light
a
short
pipe
—
the
luxury
of
the
cigar
being
then
unknown,—humming
the
while
snatches
of
a
ballad
,
the
theme
of
which
was
his
own
calling
.

a
prelate
of
singular
sanctity
,
being
afflicted
,
in
his
latter
days
,
with
a
despondency
so
deep
that
neither
penance
nor
fasting
could
remove
it
,
vowed
never
again
to
behold
,
with
earthly
eyes
,
the
blessed
light
of
heaven
,
nor
to
dwell
longer
with
his
fellowmen
;
but
,
relinquishing
his
spiritual
dignity
,
"
the
world
forgetting
,
by
the
world
forgot
,
"
to
immure
himself
,
while
living
,
within
the
tomb
.
<EOS>
He
kept
his
vow
.
<EOS>
Out
of
the
living
rock
that
sustained
the
saintly
structure
,
beneath
the
chapel
of
the
monastery
,
was
another
chapel
wrought
,
and
thither
,
after
bidding
an
eternal
farewell
to
the
world
,
and
bestowing
his
benediction
upon
his
flock
,
whom
he
committed
to
the
care
of
his
successor
,
the
holy
man
retired
.
<EOS>
Never
,
save
at
midnight
,
and
then
only
during
the
performance
of
masses
for
his
soul
's
repose
,
did
he
ascend
from
his
cell
:
and
as
the
sole
light
allowed
within
the
dismal
dungeon
of
his
choice
was
that
of
a
sepulchral
lamp
,
as
none
spoke
with
him
when
in
his
retreat
,
save
in
muttered
syllables
,
what
effect
must
the
lustre
emanating
from
a
thousand
tapers
,
the
warm
and
pungent
odors
of
the
incense
-
breathing
shrine
,
contrasted
with
the
earthy
vapors
of
his
prison
-
house
,
and
the
solemn
swell
of
the
Sanctus
,
have
had
upon
his
excited
senses
?
<EOS>
Surely
they
must
have
seemed
like
a
foretaste
of
the
heaven
he
sought
to
gain!Ascetic
to
the
severest
point
to
which
nature
's
endurance
could
be
stretched
,
Cyprian
even
denied
himself
repose
.
<EOS>
He
sought
not
sleep
,
and
knew
it
only
when
it
stole
on
him
unawares
.
<EOS>
His
couch
was
the
flinty
rock
;
and
long
afterwards
,
when
the
zealous
resorted
to
the
sainted
prior
's
cell
,
and
were
shown
those
sharp
and
jagged
stones
,
they
marvelled
how
one
like
unto
themselves
could
rest
,
or
even
recline
upon
their
points
without
anguish
,
until
it
was
explained
to
them
that
,
doubtless
,
<EOS>
He
who
tempereth
the
wind
to
the
shorn
lamb
had
made
that
flinty
couch
soft
to
the
holy
sufferer
as
a
bed
of
down
.
<EOS>
His
limbs
were
clothed
in
a
garb
of
horsehair
of
the
coarsest
fabric
;
his
drink
was
the
dank
drops
that
oozed
from
the
porous
walls
of
his
cell
;
and
his
sustenance
,
such
morsels
as
were
bestowed
upon
him
by
the
poor
—
the
only
strangers
permitted
to
approach
him
.
<EOS>
No
fire
was
suffered
,
where
perpetual
winter
reigned
.
<EOS>
None
were
admitted
to
his
nightly
vigils
;
none
witnessed
any
act
of
penance
;
nor
were
any
groans
heard
to
issue
from
that
dreary
cave
;
but
the
knotted
,
blood
-
stained
thong
,
discovered
near
his
couch
,
too
plainly
betrayed
in
what
manner
those
long
lone
nights
were
spent
.
<EOS>
Thus
did
a
year
roll
on
.
<EOS>
Traces
of
his
sufferings
were
visible
in
his
failing
strength
.
<EOS>
He
could
scarcely
crawl
;
but
he
meekly
declined
assistance
.
<EOS>
He
appeared
not
,
as
had
been
his
wo
nt
,
at
the
midnight
mass
;
the
door
of
his
cell
was
thrown
open
at
that
hour
;
the
light
streamed
down
like
a
glory
upon
his
reverend
head
;
he
heard
the
distant
reverberations
of
the
deep
Miserere
;
and
breathed
odors
as
if
wafted
from
Paradise
.
<EOS>
One
morn
it
chanced
that
they
who
sought
his
cell
found
him
with
his
head
upon
his
bosom
,
kneeling
before
the
image
of
the
virgin
patroness
of
his
shrine
.
<EOS>
Fearing
to
disturb
his
devotions
,
they
stood
reverently
looking
on
;
and
thus
silently
did
they
tarry
for
an
hour
;
but
,
as
in
that
space
he
had
shown
no
signs
of
motion
,
fearing
the
worst
,
they
ventured
to
approach
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
cold
as
the
marble
before
which
he
knelt
.
<EOS>
In
the
act
of
humblest
intercession
—
it
may
be
,
in
the
hope
of
grace
—
had
Cyprian
's
spirit
fled
.
<EOS>
"Blessed
<EOS>
are
they
who
die
in
the
Lord
,
"
exclaimed
his
brethren
,
regarding
his
remains
with
deepest
awe
.
<EOS>
On
being
touched
,
the
body
fell
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
It
was
little
more
than
a
skeleton
.
<EOS>
Under
the
cloisters
of
the
holy
pile
were
his
bones
interred
,
with
a
degree
of
pomp
and
ostentation
that
little
accorded
with
the
lowliness
and
self
-
abasement
of
this
man
of
many
sorrows
.
<EOS>
This
chapel
,
at
the
time
of
which
we
treat
,
was
pretty
much
in
the
same
condition
as
it
existed
in
the
days
of
its
holy
inmate
.
<EOS>
Hewn
out
of
the
entrails
of
the
rock
,
the
roof
,
the
vaults
,
the
floor
,
were
of
solid
granite
.
<EOS>
Three
huge
cylindrical
pillars
,
carved
out
of
the
native
rock
,
rough
as
the
stems
of
gnarled
oak
-
trees
,
lent
support
to
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
Support
,
however
,
was
unneeded
;
an
earthquake
would
scarce
have
shaken
down
those
solid
rafters
.
<EOS>
Only
in
one
corner
,
where
the
water
welled
through
a
crevice
of
the
rock
,
in
drops
that
fell
like
tears
,
was
decay
manifest
.
<EOS>
Here
the
stone
,
worn
by
the
constant
dripping
,
had
,
in
some
places
,
given
way
.
<EOS>
In
shape
,
the
vault
was
circular
.
<EOS>
The
integral
between
each
massive
pillar
formed
a
pointed
arch
.
<EOS>
Again
,
from
each
pillar
sprang
other
arches
,
which
,
crossed
by
diagonal
,
ogive
branches
,
weaving
one
into
the
other
,
and
radiating
from
the
centre
,
formed
those
beautifully
intricate
combinations
upon
which
the
eye
of
the
architectural
enthusiast
loves
to
linger
.
<EOS>
Within
the
ring
formed
by
these
triple
columns
,
in
which
again
the
pillars
had
their
own
web
of
arches
,
was
placed
an
altar
of
stone
,
and
beside
it
a
crucifix
of
the
same
rude
material
.
<EOS>
Here
also
stood
the
sainted
image
of
her
who
had
filled
the
prior
with
holy
aspirations
,
now
a
shapeless
stone
.
<EOS>
The
dim
lamp
,
that
,
like
a
star
struggling
with
the
thick
gloom
of
a
wintry
cell
,
had
shed
its
slender
radiance
over
the
brow
of
the
Virgin
Thecla
,
was
gone
.
<EOS>
But
around
the
keystone
of
the
central
arches
,
whence
a
chain
had
once
depended
,
might
be
traced
in
ancient
characters
,
half
effaced
by
time
,
the
inscription
:
Sta
.
<EOS>
Thecla
ora
pro
nobis
.
<EOS>
One
outlet
only
was
there
from
the
chapel
—
that
which
led
by
winding
steps
to
the
monastery
;
one
only
recess
—
the
prior
's
cell
.
<EOS>
The
former
faced
the
altar
;
the
latter
yawned
like
the
mouth
of
a
tomb
at
its
back
.
<EOS>
Altogether
it
was
a
dreary
place
.
<EOS>
Dumb
were
its
walls
as
when
they
refused
to
return
the
murmured
orisons
of
the
anchorite
.
<EOS>
One
uniform
sad
coloring
prevailed
throughout
.
<EOS>
The
gray
granite
was
grown
hoar
with
age
,
and
had
a
ghostly
look
;
the
columns
were
ponderous
,
and
projected
heavy
shadows
.
<EOS>
Sorrow
and
superstition
had
their
tale
,
and
a
moral
gloom
deepened
the
darkness
of
the
spot
.
<EOS>
Despair
,
which
had
inspired
its
construction
,
seemed
to
brood
therein
.
<EOS>
Hope
shunned
its
inexorable
recesses
.
<EOS>
Alone
,
within
this
dismal
sanctuary
,
with
hands
outstretched
towards
the
desecrated
image
of
its
tutelar
saint
,
knelt
Sybil
.
<EOS>
All
was
darkness
.
<EOS>
Neither
the
heavy
vapors
that
surrounded
her
,
nor
the
shrine
before
which
she
bent
,
were
visible
;
but
,
familiar
with
the
dreary
spot
,
she
knew
that
she
had
placed
herself
aright
.
<EOS>
Her
touch
had
satisfied
her
that
she
bowed
before
the
altar
of
stone
;
that
her
benighted
vision
was
turned
towards
the
broken
image
of
the
saint
,
though
now
involved
in
gloom
the
most
profound
;
and
with
clasped
hands
and
streaming
eyes
,
in
low
and
mournful
tones
,
she
addressed
herself
in
the
following
hymn
to
the
tutelar
saint
of
the
spot
:
HYMN
TO
SAINT
THECLAIn
my
trouble
,
in
my
anguish
,
In
the
depths
of
my
despair
,
As
in
grief

,
Unto
thee
I
raise
my
prayer
.
<EOS>
Sainted

<EOS>

Kneeling

in
terror
,
In
her
blind
perplexity
,
Wandering
weak
in
doubt
and
error
,
Calleth
feebly
upon
thee
.
<EOS>
Sinful
thoughts
,
sweet
saint
,
oppress
me
,
<EOS>
Thoughts
that
will
not
be
dismissed;Temptations
dark
possess
me
,
Which
my
strength
may
not
resist
.
<EOS>
I
am
full
of
pain
,
and
wearyOf
my
life
;
I
fain
would
die
:
Unto
me
the
world
is
dreary;To
the
grave
for
rest
I
fly
.
<EOS>
For
rest!—oh
!
<EOS>
could
I
borrowThy
bright
wings
,
celestial
dove!They
should
waft
me
from
my
sorrow
,
Where
peace
dwells
in
bowers
above
.
<EOS>
Upon
one
with
woes
o'erladen
,
Kneeling
lowly
at
thy
shrine;Sainted
virgin
!
<EOS>
martyr'd
maiden!Let
thy
countenance
incline!Mei

<EOS>
Unpolluted

<EOS>
Upon

with

Kneeling
lowly
at

,
Sainted

<EOS>

<EOS>
incline!Ora

<EOS>
Eleison!The
sweet
,
sad
voice
of
the
singer
died
faintly
away
.
<EOS>
The
sharpness
of
her
sorrow
was
assuaged
.
<EOS>
Seldom
,
indeed
,
is
it
that
fervent
supplication
fails
to
call
down
solace
to
the
afflicted
.
<EOS>
Sybil
became
more
composed
.
<EOS>
She
still
,
however
,
trembled
at
the
thoughts
of
what
remained
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
"They
will
be
here
<EOS>
ere
my
prayer
is
finished
,
<EOS>
"
murmured
<EOS>
she—"ere
<EOS>
the
end
is
accomplished
for
which
I
came
hither
alone
.
<EOS>
Let
me
,
oh
!
<EOS>
let
me
make
my
peace
with
my
Creator
,
ere
<EOS>
I
surrender
my
being
to
His
hands
,
and
then
let
them
deal
with
me
as
they
will
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
she
bowed
her
head
in
lowly
prayer
.
<EOS>
Again
raising
her
hands
,
and
casting
her
eyes
towards
the
black
ceiling
,
she
implored
,
in
song
,
the
intercession
of
the
saintly
man
who
had
bequeathed
his
name
to
the
cell
.
<EOS>

had
she
concluded
this
hymn
,
when
the
torch
of
the
knight
of
Malta
in
part
dissipated
the
gloom
that
hung
around
the
chapel

THE
BRIDALCari

<EOS>
I
will
not
die
;
I
must
not

<EOS>
I
am

a
young

Executioner

<EOS>
Here
's
your
wedding
-
ring.—Duchess
of
Malfy
.
<EOS>
IllustrationSLOWLY
did
the
train
descend
;
solemnly
and
in
silence
,
as
if
the
rites
at
which
they
were
about
to
assist
had
been
those
of
funereal
,
and
not
of
nuptial
,
solemnization
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
to
look
upon
those
wild
and
fierce
faces
by
the
ruddily
-
flashing
torchlight
,
which
lent
to
each
a
stern
and
savage
expression
;
to
see
those
scowling
visages
surrounding
a
bride
from
whose
pallid
cheeks
every
vestige
of
color
,
and
almost
of
animation
,
had
fled
;
and
a
bridegroom
,
with
a
countenance
yet
more
haggard
,
and
demeanor
yet
more
distracted
—
the
beholder
must
have
imagined
that
the
spectacle
was
some
horrible
ceremonial
,
practised
by
demons
rather
than
human
beings
.
<EOS>
The
arched
vault
,
the
pillars
,
the
torchlight
,
the
deep
shadows
,
and
the
wild
figures
,
formed
a
picture
worthy
of
Rembrandt
or
Salvator
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
Sybil
within
the
chapel
?
"
asked
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"I
am
here
,
"
returned
a
voice
from
the
altar
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
do
we
tarry
?
"
said
the
gipsy
queen
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
all
assembled
.
<EOS>
To
the
altar
.
<EOS>
""To
<EOS>
the
altar
!
"
shrieked
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
—
no——""Remember
<EOS>
my
threat
,
and
obey
,
"
muttered
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
my
power
now
.
<EOS>
"A
convulsive
sob
was
all
the
answer
Eleanor
could
make
.
<EOS>
"Our
<EOS>
number
is
not
complete
,
"
said
the
priest
,
who
had
looked
in
vain
for
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Peter
Bradley
is
not
with
us
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"
Let
him
be
sought
for
instantly
.
<EOS>
""Their
<EOS>
search
need
not
extend
beyond
this
spot
,
"
said
Peter
,
stepping
forward
.
<EOS>
The
knight
of
Malta
advanced
towards
the
altar
.
<EOS>
The
torchlight
reddened
upon
the
huge
stone
pillars
.
<EOS>
It
fell
upon
the
shrine
,
and
upon
the
ghastly
countenance
of
Sybil
,
who
stood
beside
it
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
as
the
light
approached
her
,
an
object
,
hitherto
hidden
from
view
,
was
revealed
.
<EOS>
Sybil
uttered
a
prolonged
and
fearful
shriek
;
the
knight
recoiled
likewise
in
horror
;
and
a
simultaneous
cry
of
astonishment
burst
from
the
lips
of
the
foremost
of
the
group
.
<EOS>
All
crowded
forwards
,
and
universal
consternation
prevailed
amongst
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
Each
one
gazed
at
his
neighbor
,
anxious
to
learn
the
occasion
of
this
tumult
,
and
vague
fears
were
communicated
to
those
behind
,
from
the
terrified
glances
,
which
were
the
only
answers
returned
by
their
comrades
in
front
.
<EOS>
"Who
has
dared
to
bring
that
body
here
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Barbara
,
in
a
tone
in
which
anger
struggled
with
apprehension
,
pointing
at
the
same
time
to
the
ghastly
corpse
of
a
female
,
with
streaming
hair
,
at
the
altar
's
feet
.
<EOS>
"
Who
has
dared
to
do
this
,
I
say
?
<EOS>
Quick
!
<EOS>
remove
it
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
stare
at
?
<EOS>
Cravens
!
<EOS>
is
this
the
first
time
you
have
looked
upon
a
corpse
,
that
you
should
shrink
aghast
—
that
you
tremble
before
it
?
<EOS>
It
is
a
clod
—
ay
,
less
than
a
clod
.
<EOS>
Away
with
it
!
<EOS>
away
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
""Touch
it
not
,
"
cried
Luke
,
lifting
a
cloud
of
black
hair
from
off
the
features
;
"
it
is
my
mother
's
body
.
<EOS>
""My
daughter
!
"
exclaimed
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"What
!
"
vociferated
Barbara
<EOS>
,
"
is
that
your
daughter
—
is
that
the
first
Lady
Rookwood
?
<EOS>
Are
the
dead
arisen
to
do
honor
to
these
nuptials
?
<EOS>
Speak
!
<EOS>
you
can
,
perchance
,
explain
how
she
came
hither
.
<EOS>
""I
know
not
,
"
returned
Peter
,
glancing
fiercely
at
Barbara
;
"
I
may
,
anon
,
demand
that
question
of
you
.
<EOS>
How
came
this
body
here?""Ask
of
Richard
Checkley
,
"
said
Barbara
,
turning
to
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
He
can
,
perchance
,
inform
you
.
<EOS>
Priest
,
"
added
she
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
this
is
your
handiwork
.
<EOS>
""Checkley
!
"
screamed
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
Is
that
Richard
Checkley
?
<EOS>
is
that——""Peace
!
"
<EOS>
thundered
Barbara
;
"
will
none
remove
the
body
?
<EOS>
Once
more
I
ask
you
,
do
you
fear
<EOS>
the
dead?"A
murmur
arose
.
<EOS>
Balthazar
alone
ventured
to
approach
the
corpse
.
<EOS>
Luke
started
to
his
feet
as
he
advanced
,
his
eyes
glaring
with
tiger
fury
.
<EOS>
"Back
,
old
man
,
"
cried
he
,
"
and
dare
not
,
any
of
you
,
to
lay
a
sacrilegious
finger
on
her
corse
,
or
I
will
stretch
him
that
advances
as
lowly
as
lies
my
mother
's
head
.
<EOS>
When
or
how
it
came
hither
matters
not
.
<EOS>
Here
,
at
the
altar
,
has
it
been
placed
,
and
none
shall
move
it
hence
.
<EOS>
The
dead
shall
witness
my
nuptials
.
<EOS>
Fate
has
ordained
it
—
my
fate
!
<EOS>
o'er

<EOS>
Her
ring
shall
link
me
to
my
bride

<EOS>
I
knew
not
,
when
I
snatched
it
from
her
death
-
cold
finger
,
to
what
end
I
preserved
it
.
<EOS>
I
learn
it
now
.
<EOS>
It
is
here
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
held
forth
a
ring
.
<EOS>
"'Tis
<EOS>
a
fatal
boon
,
that
twice
-
used
ring
,
"
cried
Sybil
;
"
such
a
ring
my
mother
,
on
her
death
-
bed
,
said
should
be
mine
.
<EOS>
Such
a
ring
<EOS>
she
said
should
we
d
<EOS>
me——""Unto
whom
?
"
fiercely
demanded
Luke
.
<EOS>
"UNTO
DEATH
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
solemnly
rejoined
.
<EOS>
Luke
's
countenance
fell
.
<EOS>
He
turned
aside
,
deeply
abashed
,
unable
further
to
brook
her
gaze
;
while
in
accents
of
such
wildly
touching
pathos
as
sank
into
the
hearts
of
each
who
heard
her
—
hearts
,
few
of
them
framed
of
penetrable
stuff
—
<EOS>
the
despairing
maiden
burst
into
the
following
strain
:
<EOS>
THE
TWICE
-
USED
RING"Beware
thy
bridal
day!"On
her
death
-
bed
sighed
my
mother;"Beware
,
beware
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
Death
shall
we
d
thee
,
and
no
other
.
<EOS>
Cold
the
hand
shall
grasp
thee
,
Cold
<EOS>
the
arms
shall
clasp
thee
,
Colder
lips
thy
kiss
shall
smother!Beware
thy
bridal
kiss!"Thy
wedding
ring
<EOS>
shall
beFrom
a
clay
-
cold
finger
taken;From
one
<EOS>
that
,
like
to
thee
,
Was
by
her
love
forsaken
.
<EOS>
For
a
twice
-
used
ringIs
a
fatal
thing;Her
griefs
who
wore
it
are
partaken—,Beware
<EOS>
that
fatal
ring!"The
altar
and
the
graveMany
steps
are
not
asunder;Bright
banners
<EOS>
o'er
thee
wave
,
Shrouded
horror
lieth
under
.
<EOS>
Blithe
may
sound
the
bell
,
Yet
<EOS>
'
twill
toll
thy
knell;Scathed
thy
chaplet
by
the
thunder
—
<EOS>
Beware
that
blighted
wreath!"Beware
<EOS>
my
bridal
day!Dying
lips
my
doom
have
<EOS>
spoken;Deep
tones
call
me
away;From
<EOS>
the
grave
is
sent
a
token
.
<EOS>
Cold
,
cold
fingers
<EOS>
bringThat
ill
-
omen'd
ring;Soon
will
a
second
heart
be
broken;This
<EOS>
is
my
bridal
day
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
deep
,
profound
silence
as
the
last
melancholy
cadence
died
away
,
and
many
a
rugged
heart
was
melted
,
even
to
tears
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
meanwhile
,
remained
in
a
state
of
passive
stupefaction
,
vacantly
gazing
at
Sybil
,
upon
whom
alone
her
eyes
were
fixed
,
and
appearing
indistinctly
to
apprehend
the
meaning
of
her
song
.
<EOS>
"This
is
my
bridal
day
,
"
murmured
she
,
in
a
low
tone
,
when
Sybil
had
finished
.
"
<EOS>
Said
not
that
sweet
voice
so
?
<EOS>
I
know
'
tis
my
bridal
day
.
<EOS>
What
a
church
you
have
chosen
,
mother
!
<EOS>
A
tomb
—
a
sepulchre
—
but
'
tis
meet
for
such
nuptials
as
mine
—
and
what
wedding
guests
!
<EOS>
Was
that
pale
woman
in
her
shroud
-
like
dress
invited
here
by
you
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
that
,
mother
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
God
,
her
senses
are
gone
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs.
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
"
Why
did
I
venture
into
this
horrible
place?""Ask
not
why
now
,
madam
,
"
rejoined
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
The
hour
for
consideration
is
past
.
<EOS>
We
must
act
.
<EOS>
Let
the
marriage
proceed
,
at
all
hazards
;
we
will
then
take
means
to
extricate
ourselves
from
this
accursed
place
.
<EOS>
""Remove
<EOS>
that
horrible
object
,
"
said
Mrs.
Mowbray
;
"
it
fascinates
the
vision
of
my
child
.
<EOS>
""Lend
<EOS>
me
your
hand
,
Richard
Checkley
,
"
said
Peter
,
sternly
regarding
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"No
,
no
,
"
replied
the
priest
,
shuddering
;
"
I
will
not
,
can
not
touch
it
.
<EOS>
Do
you
alone
remove
it
.
<EOS>
"Peter
approached
Luke
.
<EOS>
The
latter
now
offered
no
further
opposition
,
and
the
body
was
taken
away
.
<EOS>
The
eyes
of
Eleanor
followed
it
into
the
dark
recesses
of
the
vault
;
and
when
she
could
no
longer
distinguish
the
white
flutter
of
the
cereclothes
,
her
laboring
bosom
seemed
torn
asunder
with
the
profound
sigh
that
burst
from
it
,
and
her
head
declined
upon
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
me
see
that
ring
,
"
said
the
priest
,
addressing
Luke
,
who
still
held
the
wedding
-
ring
between
his
fingers
.
<EOS>
"I
am
not
naturally
superstitious
,
"
said
Mrs.
Mowbray
;
"
whether
my
mind
be
affected
with
the
horrors
of
this
place
,
I
know
not
;
but
I
have
a
dread
of
that
ring
.
<EOS>
She
shall
not
use
it
.
<EOS>
""Where
<EOS>
no
other
can
be
found
,
"
said
the
priest
,
with
a
significant
and
peculiar
look
at
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
"
I
see
no
reason
why
this
should
be
rejected
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
suspected
you
,
madam
,
of
such
weakness
.
<EOS>
Grant
there
were
evil
spell
,
or
charm
,
attached
to
it
,
which
,
trust
me
,
there
is
not
—
as
how
should
there
be
,
to
a
harmless
piece
of
gold?—my
benediction
,
and
aspersion
with
holy
lymph
,
will
have
sufficient
power
to
exorcise
and
expel
it
.
<EOS>
To
remove
your
fears
it
shall
be
done
at
once
.
<EOS>
"A
cup
containing
water
was
brought
,
together
with
a
plate
of
salt
—
which
condiment
<EOS>
the
devil
is
said
to
abhor
,
and
which
is
held
to
be
a
symbol
of
immortality
and
of
eternity
;
in
that
,
being
itself
incorruptible
,
it
preserves
all
else
from
corruption,—and
,
with
the
customary
Romish
formula
of
prayer
and
exorcism
,
the
priest
thrice
mingled
the
crystal
particles
with
the
pure
fluid
;
after
which
,
taking
the
ring
in
his
hand
with
much
solemnity
,
he
sprinkled
it
with
a
few
drops
of
the
water
which
he
had
blessed
;
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
upon
the
golden
circlet
;
uttered
another
and
more
potent
exorcism
to
eradicate
and
expel
every
device
of
Satan
,
and
delivered
it
back
to
Luke
.
<EOS>
"She
may
wear
it
now
in
safety
,
"
said
the
sexton
,
with
strong
contempt
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Were
the
snake
himself
coiled
round
that
consecrated
bauble
,
the
prayers
of
the
devout
Father
Checkley
would
unclasp
his
lithest
folds
.
<EOS>
But
wherefore
do
we
tarry
now
?
<EOS>
Naught
lies
between
us
and
the
altar
.
<EOS>
The
path
is
clear
.
<EOS>
The
bridegroom
grows
impatient
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
the
bride
?
"
asked
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
ready
,
"
replied
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
delay
not
longer
.
<EOS>
Daughter
,
your
hand
.
<EOS>
"Eleanor
gave
her
hand
.
<EOS>
It
was
clammy
and
cold
.
<EOS>
Supported
by
her
mother
,
she
moved
slowly
towards
the
altar
,
which
was
but
a
few
steps
from
where
they
stood
.
<EOS>
She
offered
no
resistance
,
but
did
not
raise
her
head
.
<EOS>
Luke
was
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
Then
for
the
first
time
did
the
enormity
of
the
cruel
,
dishonorable
act
he
was
about
to
commit
,
strike
him
with
its
full
force
.
<EOS>
He
saw
it
in
its
darkest
colors
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
those
terrible
moments
when
the
headlong
wheel
of
passion
stands
suddenly
still
.
<EOS>
"There
is
yet
time
,
"
groaned
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
let
me
not
damn
myself
perpetually
!
<EOS>
Let
me
save
her
;
save
Sybil
;
save
myself
.
<EOS>
"They
were
at
the
altar
—
that
wild
wedding
train
.
<EOS>
High
over
head
the
torch
was
raised
.
<EOS>
The
red
light
flashed
on
bridegroom
and
on
bride
,
giving
to
the
pale
features
of
each
an
almost
livid
look
;
it
fell
upon
the
gaunt
aspect
of
the
sexton
,
and
lit
up
the
smile
of
triumphant
malice
that
played
upon
his
face
;
it
fell
upon
the
fantastical
habiliments
of
Barbara
,
and
upon
the
haughty
but
perturbed
physiognomy
of
Mrs.
Mowbray
;
it
fell
upon
the
salient
points
of
the
Gothic
arches
;
upon
one
molded
pillar
;
upon
the
marble
image
of
the
virgin
Thecla
;
and
on
the
scarcely
less
marble
countenance
of
Sybil
who
stood
behind
the
altar
,
silent
,
statue
-
like
,
immovable
.
<EOS>
The
effect
of
light
and
shade
on
other
parts
of
the
scene
,
upon
the
wild
drapery
,
and
harsh
lineaments
of
many
of
the
group
,
was
also
eminently
striking
.
<EOS>
Just
as
the
priest
was
about
to
commence
the
marriage
service
,
a
yelling
chorus
,
which
the
gipsies
were
accustomed
to
sing
at
the
celebration
of
the
nuptials
of
one
of
their
own
tribe
,
burst
forth
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
horribly
discordant
than
their
song
.

uncouth
chorus
ended
,
the
marriage
proceeded
.
<EOS>
Sybil
had
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Had
she
fled
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
she
was
by
the
bride
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
mechanically
took
her
place
.
<EOS>
A
faint
voice
syllabled
the
responses
.
<EOS>
You
could
scarcely
have
seen
Miss
Mowbray
's
lips
move
.
<EOS>
But
the
answers
were
given
,
and
the
priest
was
satisfied
.
<EOS>
He
took
the
ring
,
and
sprinkled
it
once
again
with
the
holy
water
,
in
the
form
of
the
cross
.
<EOS>
He
pronounced
the
prayer
:
"
Benedic
,
Domine
,
annulum
hunc
,
quem
nos
in
tuo
nomine
benedicimus
,
ut
quæ
eum

tenens
,
in

atque

mutua
charitate

<EOS>
"He
was
about
to
return
the
ring
to
Luke
,
when
the
torch
,
held
by
the
knight
of
Malta
,
was
dashed
to
the
ground
by
some
unseen
hand
,
and
instantly
extinguished
.
<EOS>
The
wild
pageant
vanished
as
suddenly
as
the
figures
cast
by
a
magic
-
lantern
upon
a
wall
disappear
when
the
glass
is
removed
.
<EOS>
A
wild
hubbub
succeeded
.
<EOS>
Hoarsely
above
the
clamor
arose
the
voice
of
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
the
door
,
quickly!—to
the
door
!
<EOS>
Let
no
one
pass
,
I
will
find
out
the
author
of
this
mishap
anon
.
<EOS>
Away!"She
was
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Several
of
the
crew
stationed
themselves
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"Proceed
<EOS>
now
with
the
ceremony
,
"
continued
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
darkness
,
or
by
light
,
the
match
shall
be
completed
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
ring
was
then
placed
upon
the
finger
of
the
bride
;
and
as
Luke
touched
it
,
he
shuddered
.
<EOS>
It
was
cold
as
that
of
the
corpse
which
he
had
clasped
but
now
.
<EOS>
The
prayer
was
said
,
the
blessing
given
,
the
marriage
was
complete
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
there
issued
from
the
darkness
deep
dirge
-
like
tones
,
and
a
voice
solemnly
chanted
a
strain
,
which
all
knew
to
be
the
death
-
song
of
their
race
,
hymned
by
wailing
women
over
an
expiring
sister
.
<EOS>
The
music
seemed
to
float
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
THE
SOUL

BELLFast
<EOS>

Fast

sigh
exhaling

<EOS>
Fast

dying

<EOS>
With
death
's
chills
her
limbs
are
shivering
,
With
death
's
gasp
<EOS>
the
lips
are
quivering

Fast

O'er

Hark

the

Soul

bell
tolling

Hollowly
in

<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
marriage
group
yet
lingered
near
the
altar
,
awaiting
,
it
would
seem
,
permission
from
the
gipsy
queen
to
quit
the
cell
.
<EOS>
Luke
stirred
not
.
<EOS>
Clasped
in
his
own
,
the
cold
hand
of
his
bride
detained
him
;
and
when
he
would
have
moved
,
her
tightened
grasp
prevented
his
departure

<EOS>
Mrs
.
<EOS>
Mowbray
's
patience
was
exhausted
by
the
delay
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
altogether
free
from
apprehension
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
we
linger
here
?
<EOS>
"
she
whispered
to
the
priest
.
"
<EOS>
Do
you
,
father
,
lead
the
way
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
crowd
is
dense

"
replied
Checkley
.
<EOS>
"
They
resist
my
effort
.
<EOS>
""Are
<EOS>

prisoners
here

"
asked
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
in
alarm
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
me
make
the
attempt

"
cried
Luke
,
with
fiery
impatience

<EOS>
"
I
will
force
a
passage
out

<EOS>
""Quit
<EOS>
not
your
bride

whispered
Peter
,
"
as
you
value
her
safety

<EOS>
Heed
not

She

Suffer

Remain

issue

<EOS>
""Enough
,
"
replied
Luke
;
"
I
stir
not
hence
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
drew
his
bride
closer
towards
him
.
<EOS>
He
stooped
to
imprint
a
kiss
upon
her
lips
.
<EOS>
A
cold
shudder
ran
through
her
frame
as
he
touched
them
,
but
she
resisted
not
his
embrace
.
<EOS>
Peter
's
attempt
to
effect
an
egress
was
as
unsuccessful
as
that
of
the
priest
.
<EOS>
Presenting
Excalibur
at
his
bosom
,
the
knight
of
Malta
challenged
him
to
stand
.
<EOS>
"You
can
not
pass
,
"
exclaimed
the
knight
;
"
our
orders
are
peremptory
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
am
I
to
understand
by
this
?
"
said
Peter
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
Why
are
we
detained?""You
will
learn
all
anon
,
"
returned
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"
In
the
meantime
you
are
my
prisoners
—
or
,
if
you
like
not
the
phrase
,
my
wedding
guests
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
wedding
is
complete
,
"
returned
the
sexton
;
"
the
bride
and
bridegroom
are
impatient
to
depart
,
and
we
,
the
guests
—
albeit
some
of
us
may
be
no
foes
to
darkness
—
desire
not
to
hold
our
nuptial
revels
here
.
<EOS>
""Sybil
's
wedding
has
not
taken
place
,
"
said
Barbara
;
"
you
must
tarry
for
that
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
now
it
comes
,
"
thought
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
And
who
,
may
I
ask
,
"
said
he
,
aloud
,
"
amongst
this
goodly
company
,
is
to
be
her
<EOS>
bridegroom?""The
best
amongst
them
,
"
returned
Barbara—"Sir
Luke
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
""He
has
a
bride
already
,
"
replied
Peter
.
<EOS>
"She
may
be
removed
,
"
said
Barbara
,
with
bitter
and
peculiar
emphasis
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dost
understand
my
meaning
now?""I
will
not
understand
it
,
"
said
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
mean
to
destroy
her
who
now
stands
at
the
altar?""She
who
now
stands
at
the
altar
must
make
way
for
a
successor
.
<EOS>
She
who
grasps
the
bridegroom
's
hand
shall
die
.
<EOS>
I
swear
it
by
the
oath
of
my
tribe
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
think
you
,
you
will
be
allowed
to
execute
your
murderous
intention
with
impunity
?
<EOS>
"
shrieked
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
in
an
agony
of
terror
.
<EOS>
"
Think
you
that
I
will
stand
by
and
see
my
child
slaughtered
before
my
face
;
that
my
friends
will
suffer
it
?
<EOS>
Think
you
that
even
your
own
tribe
will
dare
to
execute
your
horrible
purpose
?
<EOS>
They
will
not
.
<EOS>
They
will
side
with
us
.
<EOS>
Even
now
they
murmur
.
<EOS>
What
can
you
hope
to
gain
by
an
act
so
wild
and
dreadful
?
<EOS>
What
object
can
you
have?""The
same
as
your
own
,
"
reiterated
Barbara—"the
advancement
of
my
child
.
<EOS>
Sybil
is
as
dear
to
me
as
Eleanor
is
to
you
.
<EOS>
She
is
my
child
's
child
,
the
daughter
of
my
best
beloved
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
have
sworn
to
marry
her
to
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
The
means
are
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
I
will
keep
my
vow
;
I
will
we
d
her
to
him
.
<EOS>
You
did
not
hesitate
to
tear
your
daughter
from
the
man
she
loved
,
to
give
her
to
the
man
she
hated
;
and
for
what
?
<EOS>
For
gold
—
for
power
—
for
rank
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
same
motive
.
<EOS>
I
love
my
child
,
and
she
loves
Sir
Luke
—
has
loved
him
long
and
truly
;
therefore
shall
she
have
him
.
<EOS>
What
to
me
is
your
child
,
or
your
feelings
,
except
they
are
subservient
to
my
wishes
?
<EOS>
She
stands
in
my
way
.
<EOS>
I
remove
her
.
<EOS>
""Who
<EOS>
placed
her
in
your
path
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
not
lend
a
helping
hand
to
create
that
obstacle
yourself?""I
did
,
"
replied
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
you
know
wherefore
?
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
double
motive
for
it
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
curse
upon
the
house
of
Rookwood
,
that
kills
the
first
fair
bride
each
generation
leads
to
the
altar
.
<EOS>
Have
you
never
heard
of
it?""I
have
!
<EOS>
And
did
that
idle
legend
sway
<EOS>
you?""And
<EOS>
do
you
call
it
idle
?
<EOS>
You
!
<EOS>
Well
—
I
had
another
motive
—
a
prophecy
.
<EOS>
""By
<EOS>
yourself
uttered
,
"
replied
Peter
.
<EOS>
"Even
<EOS>
so
,
"
replied
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"
The
prophecy
is
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
The
stray
rook
is
found
.
<EOS>
The
rook
hath
with

mated

<EOS>
Luke
hath
wedded
Eleanor

<EOS>
He
will
hold
possession
of
his
lands
.
<EOS>
The
prophecy
is
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
how
?
"
asked
Peter
;
"
will
your
art
tell
you
how
and
why
he
shall
now
hold
possession
?
<EOS>
Can
you
tell
me
that?""My
<EOS>
art
goes
not
so
far

<EOS>
I
have
predicted
the
event
.
<EOS>
It
has
come
to
pass
.
<EOS>
I
am
satisfied
.
<EOS>
He
has
wedded
her
.
<EOS>
Be
it
mine
to
free
him
from
that
yoke
.
"
<EOS>
And
Barbara
laughed
exultingly
.
<EOS>
The
sexton
approached
the
old
crone
,
and
laid
his
hand
with
violence
upon
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"Hear
me
,
"
cried
he
,
"
and
I
will
tell
you
that
which
your
juggling
art
refuses
to
reveal
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
Mowbray
is
heir
to
the
lands
of
Rookwood
!
<EOS>
The
estates
are
hers
!
<EOS>
They
were
bequeathed
to
her
by
her
grandsire
,
Sir
Reginald
.
<EOS>
""She
was
unborn
when
he
died
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
"True
,
"
replied
Peter
;
"
but
the
lands
were
left
to
your
issue
female
,
should
such
issue
be
born
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
did
Sir
Piers
,
my
brother
,
know
of
this
?
<EOS>
did
he
see
this
will
,
"
asked
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
with
trembling
impatience
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
did
;
and
withheld
the
knowledge
of
it
from
you
and
yours
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
why
knew
I
not
this
before
?
<EOS>
Why
did
you
not
tell
me
ere
that
was
done
which
can
not
be
undone
?
<EOS>
I
have
sacrificed
my
child
.
<EOS>
""Because
it
did
not
chime
with
my
purposes
to
tell
you
,
"
replied
Peter
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"It
is
false
—
it
is
false
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
her
anger
and
vexation
getting
the
better
of
her
fears
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
believe
it
.
<EOS>
Who
are
you
,
that
pretend
to
know
the
secrets
of
our
house?""One
of
that
house

"
replied
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
name?""Would
you
know
my
name
?

"
answered
Peter
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
The
time
is
come
when
I
will
no
longer
conceal
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
Alan
Rookwood

<EOS>
""My
father

"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
"Ay

Alan
Rookwood

<EOS>
The

enemy

of

I

I

the
avenger

I
saw
your

<EOS>
I
heard
his
groans
—
his
groans!—ha

<EOS>
I
saw
his
sons
die
:
one
fell
in
battle
<EOS>
—
I
was
with
him
there
.
<EOS>
The
other
expired
in
his
bed
.
<EOS>
I
was
with
Sir
Piers
when
he
breathed
his
last
,
and
listened
to
his
death
agonies
.
'
<EOS>
Twas
I
who
counselled
him
to
keep
the
lands
from
you
and
from
your
child
,
and
he
withheld
them
.
<EOS>
One
only
amongst
the
race
,
whose
name
I
have
cast
off
,
have
I
loved
;
and
him
—
because

added
he
,
with
something
like
<EOS>
emotion—"because
<EOS>
he
was
my
daughter
's
child
—
Luke
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
And
even
he
shall
minister
to
my
vengeance
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
your
curse
—
your
daughter

curse
—
for
he
loves
her
not

<EOS>
Yet
he
is
her
husband
,
and
hath
her
land;—ha
,
ha
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
laughed
till
he
became
convulsed
with
the
paroxysm
of
fiendish
exultation
.
<EOS>
"Mine
<EOS>
ears
are
stunned

cried
Mrs.
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
"The

mine

said
Barbara

"Alan

Rookwood

<EOS>
for
so
we
shall
henceforth
denominate
the
sexton

suddenly
grew
calm
:
he
raised
the
whistle
to
his
lips
,
and
blew
a
call
so
loud
and
shrill
,
that
those
who
were
advancing
hung
back
irresolute
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
rush
at
the
door
of
the
vault
.
<EOS>
The
sentinels
were
struck
down
;
and
with
pistols
in
each
hand
,
and
followed
by
two
assistants
,
Dick
Turpin
sprang
into
the
thick
of
the
crew

"Here
we
are

simultaneously

"Then

Dick

pushing
in
the
direction
of
the
sounds

bearing
down
all
opposition

a

there

ticklish

furiously

The

again
blazed

Its

fell
upon

Barbara

"Hold

exclaimed
a
voice
from

The
voice
was
that

Sybil

Her

clasped

"Take

""How

asked
Dick

calling

hair
.
<EOS>
Barbara
looked
at
him
at
first
with
distrust
;
but
as
he
developed
his
secret
purposes
,
that
smile
became
reflected
upon
her
own
features
.
<EOS>
Their
conference
took
place
apart
.
<EOS>
We
willingly
leave
them
to
return
to
the
altar
.
<EOS>
Mrs
.
Mowbray
and
the
priest
were
still
there
.
<EOS>
Both
were
occupied
in
ineffectual
endeavors
to
restore
Eleanor
to
consciousness
.
<EOS>
She
recovered
from
her
swoon
;
but
it
was
evident
her
senses
still
wandered
;
and
vainly
did
Mrs.
Mowbray
lavish
her
tenderest
caresses
upon
her
child
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
returned
them
not
.
<EOS>
Luke
,
meanwhile
,
had
given
vent
to
the
wildest
fury
.
<EOS>
He
shook
away
Sybil
's
grasp
;
he
dashed
her
from
him
;
he
regarded
her
with
withering
glances
;
he
loaded
her
with
reproaches
.
<EOS>
She
bore
his
violence
with
meekest
submission
;
she
looked
imploringly
—
but
she
replied
not
to
his
taunts
.
<EOS>
Again
she
clung
to
the
hem
of
his
garment
when
cast
aside
.
<EOS>
Luke
appeared
unmoved
;
what
passed
within
we
pause
not
to
examine
.
<EOS>
He
grew
calmer
;
his
calmness
was
more
terrible
to
Sybil
than
his
previous
wrath
had
been
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
are
my
wife
,
"
said
he
;
"
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
By
fraud
,
by
stratagem
,
you
have
obtained
that
title
,
and
,
perforce
,
must
keep
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
title
onlyshall
you
retain
.
<EOS>
No
rights
of
wife
shall
ever
be
yours
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
in
your
power
to
call
yourself
Lady
Rookwood
—
you
will
be
so
in
name
—
in
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
shall
not
bear
it
long
,
"
murmured
Sybil
.
<EOS>
Luke
laughed
scornfully
,
"
So
you
said
before
,
"
replied
he
;
"
and
yet
I
see
not
why
you
are
likely
to
abandon
it
.
<EOS>
The
event
will
show
.
<EOS>
Thus
far
you
have
deceived
me
,
and
I
place
no
further
faith
in
your
assertions
.
<EOS>
My
hand
was
yours
;
you
refused
it
.
<EOS>
When
I
would
give
it
to
another
,
you
grasp
it
clandestinely
.
<EOS>
Am
I
to
believe
you
now
?
<EOS>
The
wind
will
change
—
the
vane
veer
with
it
.
<EOS>
""It
will
not
veer
from
you
,
"
she
meekly
answered
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
did
you
step
between
me
and
my
bride?""To
<EOS>
save
her
life
;
to
lay
down
mine
for
hers
.
<EOS>
""An
idle
subterfuge
.
<EOS>
You
know
well
that
you
run
no
risk
of
being
called
upon
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Your
life
is
in
no
danger
.
<EOS>
The
sacrifice
was
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
dispensed
with
your
assistance
;
my
own
arm
would
have
sufficed
to
protect
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
single
arm
would
not
have
prevailed
against
numbers
:
they
would
have
killed
you
likewise
.
<EOS>
""Tush
!
<EOS>
"
said
Luke
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
Not
only
have
you
snatched
from
me
my
bride
,
you
have
robbed
me
of
my
fair
estates
,
of
all
,
save
of
my
barren
title
,
and
that
,
even
that
,
you
have
tarnished
.
<EOS>
""True
,
true
,
"
sighed
Sybil
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
not
that
the
lands
were
hers
,
else
had
I
never
done
it
.
<EOS>
""False
,
false
,
"
cried
Luke
;
"
false
as
the
rest
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
Ranulph
's
.
<EOS>
She
will
be
Ranulph
's
.
<EOS>
I
shall
still
be
an
outcast
,
while
Ranulph
will
riot
in
my
halls
—
will
press
her
to
his
bosom
.
<EOS>
Cling
not
to
me
.
<EOS>
Hence
!
<EOS>
or
I
will
spurn
you
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
undone
,
undone
by
you
,
accursed
one
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
curse
me
not
!
<EOS>
your
words
cut
deep
enough
.
<EOS>
""Would
<EOS>
they
could
kill
you
,
"
cried
Luke
,
with
savage
bitterness
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
placed
a
bar
between
me
and
my
prospects
,
which
nothing
can
now
remove
—
nothing
<EOS>
but
—
ha
!
<EOS>
"
and
his
countenance
assumed
a
deadly
hue
and
fearful
expression
.
"
<EOS>
By
Heaven
,
you
almost
rouse
the
fell
spirit
which
it
is
said
dwells
within
the
breast
of
my
devoted
race
.
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
I
could
stab
thee
.
<EOS>
""No
,
no
!
"
shrieked
Sybil
;
"
for
mercy
's
sake
,
for
your
own
sake
,
do
not
stab
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
too
late
.
<EOS>
I
will
repair
my
wrong!""Ever
deceiving
!
<EOS>
you
would
again
delude
me
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
repair
it
.
<EOS>
One
way
alone
remains
,
and
that——""I
will
pursue
,
"
responded
Sybil
,
sadly
,
but
firmly
.
"Never
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Luke
;
"
you
shall
not
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
he
,
as
he
found
his
arms
suddenly
pinioned
behind
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
new
treachery
is
this
?
<EOS>
By
whose
orders
am
I
thus
fettered?""By
mine
,
"
said
Alan
Rookwood
,
stepping
forward
.
<EOS>
"By
yours
?
"
echoed
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
wherefore
?
<EOS>
Release
me
.
<EOS>
""Be
patient
,
"
replied
Alan
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
hear
all
anon
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
you
must
be
content
to
remain
my
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Quit
not
your
hold
,
"
added
he
,
addressing
the
gipsies
,
who
kept
charge
of
Luke
.
<EOS>
"Their
<EOS>
lives
shall
answer
for
their
obedience
,
"
said
Barbara
.
<EOS>
Upon
a
further
signal
from
Alan
,
Eleanor
was
torn
from
her
mother
's
arms
,
and
a
bandage
passed
so
suddenly
over
Mrs.
Mowbray
's
face
,
that
,
before
she
could
raise
a
cry
of
alarm
,
all
possibility
of
utterance
was
effectually
prevented
.
<EOS>
The
priest
alone
was
left
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
Barbara
snatched
the
hand
of
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
She
dragged
her
to
Sybil
.
<EOS>
"You
are
Lady
Rookwood
,
"
whispered
she
;
"
but
she
has
your
domains
.
<EOS>
I
give
her
to
you
.
<EOS>
""She
<EOS>
is
the
only
bar
between
thy
husband
and
his
rights
,
"
whispered
Alan
Rookwood
,
in
a
tone
of
horrible
irony
;
"
it
is
not
too
late
to
repair
your
wrong
.
<EOS>
""Away
,
tempter
!
"
cried
Sybil
,
horror
-
stricken
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
well
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
"
continued
she
,
in
an
altered
tone
,
"
I
will
risk
all
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
him
wrong
.
<EOS>
One
mode
of
atonement
remains
;
and
,
horrible
though
it
be
,
I
will
embrace
it
.
<EOS>
Let
me
not
pause
.
<EOS>
Give
her
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
seized
upon
the
unresisting
hand
of
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
need
my
aid
?
"
asked
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"No
,
"
replied
Sybil
;
"
let
none
approach
us
.
<EOS>
A
clapping
of
hands
will
let
you
know
when
all
is
over
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
dragged
her
passive
victim
deeper
into
the
vault
.
<EOS>
"Sybil
,
Sybil
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Luke
,
struggling
with
frantic
violence
to
liberate
himself
;
"
hurt
her
not
.
<EOS>
I
was
rash
.
<EOS>
I
was
mad
.
<EOS>
I
am
calmer
now
.
<EOS>
She
hears
me
not
—
she
will
not
turn
.
<EOS>
God
of
heaven
!
<EOS>
she
will
murder
her
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
done
while
I
speak
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
cause
of
all
.
<EOS>
Release
me
,
villains
!
<EOS>
Would
that
I
had
died
ere
<EOS>
I
had
seen
this
day
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
a
signal
from
the
sexton
,
Luke
also
was
blindfolded
.
<EOS>
He
ceased
to
struggle
.
<EOS>
But
his
laboring
breast
told
of
the
strife
within
.
"Miscreants
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
priest
,
<EOS>
who
had
hitherto
witnessed
the
proceedings
in
horror
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
not
these
rocks
fall
in
,
and
crush
you
and
your
iniquities
?
<EOS>
Save
her
!
<EOS>
oh
,
save
her
!
<EOS>
Have
you
no
pity
for
the
innocent?""Such
pity
<EOS>
have
we
,
"
replied
Alan
Rookwood
,
"
as
you
showed
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
She
was
as
innocent
as
Eleanor
Mowbray
,
and
yet
you
did
not
pity
her
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
<EOS>
is
my
witness
,
"
exclaimed
the
priest
,
"
that
I
never
injured
her
.
<EOS>
""Take
<EOS>
not
Heaven
's
name
in
vain
,
"
cried
Alan
.
<EOS>
"
Who
stood
by
while
it
was
doing
?
<EOS>
Whose
firmer
hand
lent
aid
to
the
murderer
's
trembling
efforts
?
<EOS>
Whose
pressure
stifled
her
thrilling
screams
,
and
choked
her
cries
for
mercy
?
<EOS>
Yours
—
yours
;
and
now
you
prate
to
me
of
pity
—
you
,
the
slayer
of
the
sleeping
and
the
innocent!""'Tis
false
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
priest
,
in
extremity
of
terror
.
"False
!
"
echoed
Alan
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
Sir
Piers
's
own
confession
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
all
.
<EOS>
You
had
designs
upon
Sir
Piers
,
which
his
wife
opposed
;
you
hated
her
;
you
were
in
the
confidence
of
both
—
how
did
you
keep
that
confidence
?
<EOS>
He
told
me
how
,
by
awakening
a
spirit
of
jealousy
and
pride
,
that
o'ermastered
all
his
better
feelings
.
<EOS>
False
!
<EOS>
He
told
me
of
your
hellish
machinations
;
your
Jesuitical
plots
;
your
schemes
.
<EOS>
He
was
too
weak
,
too
feeble
an
instrument
to
serve
you
.
<EOS>
You
left
him
,
but
not
before
she
had
left
him
.
<EOS>
False
!
<EOS>
ha
,
I
have
that
shall
instantly
convict
you
.
<EOS>
The
corpse
is
here
,
within
this
cell
.
<EOS>
Who
brought
it
<EOS>
hither?"The
priest
was
silent
:
he
seemed
confounded
by
Alan
's
violence
.
<EOS>
"I
will
answer
that
question
,
"
said
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
brought
hither
by
that
false
priest
.
<EOS>
His
agent
,
Balthazar
,
has
betrayed
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
brought
hither
to
prevent
the
discovery
of
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
's
legitimacy
.
<EOS>
He
meant
to
make
his
own
terms
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
has
come
hither
to
proclaim
his
guilt
—
to
be
a
fearful
witness
against
him
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
turning
to
Checkley
,
she
added
,
"
You
have
called
Heaven
to
witness
your
innocence
:
you
shall
attest
it
by
oath
upon
that
body
;
and
should
aught
indicate
your
guilt
,
I
will
hang
you
as
I
would
a
dog
,
and
clear
off
one
long
score
with
justice
.
<EOS>
Do
you
shrink
from
this?""No
,
"
replied
the
priest
,
in
a
voice
hollow
and
broken
.
<EOS>
"
Bring
me
to
the
body
.
<EOS>
""Seize
<EOS>
each
an
arm
,
"
said
Barbara
,
addressing
Zoroaster
and
the
knight
of
Malta
,
"
and
lead
him
to
the
corse
.
<EOS>
""I
will
administer
the
oath
,
"
said
Alan
Rookwood
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"No
,
not
you
,
"
stammered
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
wherefore
not
?
"
asked
Alan
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
innocent
,
you
need
fear
nothing
from
her
.
<EOS>
""I
fear
nothing
from
the
dead
,
"
replied
Checkley
;
"
lead
on
.
"We
<EOS>
will
now
return
to
Sybil
.
<EOS>
She
was
alone
with
her
victim
.
<EOS>
They
were
near
the
mouth
of
the
cell
which
had
been
Prior
Cyprian
's
flinty
dormitory
,
and
were
almost
involved
in
darkness
.
<EOS>
A
broken
stream
of
light
glanced
through
the
pillars
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
had
not
spoken
.
<EOS>
She
suffered
herself
to
be
dragged
thither
without
resistance
,
scarcely
conscious
,
it
would
seem
,
of
her
danger
.
<EOS>
Sybil
gazed
upon
her
for
some
minutes
with
sorrow
and
surprise
.
"
<EOS>
She
comprehends
not
her
perilous
situation
,
"
murmured
Sybil
.
"
<EOS>
She
knows
not
that
she
stands
upon
the
brink
of
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
would
that
she
could
pray
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
,
her
murderess
,
pray
for
her
?
<EOS>
My
prayers
would
not
be
heard
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
to
kill
her
unshriven
will
be
a
twofold
crime
.
<EOS>
Let
me
not
look
on
her
.
<EOS>
My
hand
trembles
.
<EOS>
I
can
scarce
grasp
the
dagger
.
<EOS>
Let
me
think
on
all
he
has
said
.
<EOS>
I
have
wronged
him
.
<EOS>
I
am
his
bane
,
his
curse
!
<EOS>
I
have
robbed
him
of
all
:
there
is
but
one
remedy—'tis
this!—Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
she
recovers
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
do
it
now
.
<EOS>
"It
was
a
fearful
moment
for
Eleanor
's
revival
,
when
the
bright
steel
flashed
before
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
Terror
at
once
restored
her
.
<EOS>
She
cast
herself
at
Sybil
's
feet
.
<EOS>
"Spare
<EOS>
,
spare
me
!

<EOS>
cried
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
what
a
dream
I
have
had

<EOS>
And
to
waken
thus
,
with
the
dagger
's
point
at
my
breast

<EOS>
You
will
not
kill
me

you

gentle
maid

promised
to
preserve
me

<EOS>
Ah

no

I
am
sure
you
will
not

<EOS>
""Appeal
<EOS>
no
more
to
me

said
Sybil
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
Make
your
peace
with
Heaven

<EOS>
Your
minutes
are
numbered

<EOS>
""I
can
not

said
Eleanor
,
"
while
you
are
near
me

<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
you
pray
if
I
retire
and
leave
you?""No

no

shrieked
Eleanor
,
in
extremity
of
terror

<EOS>
"
Oh
!
do
not

me

let
me
go

""If

Sybil

I
stab
you
to
the
heart

<EOS>
""I

I

kneel
here

<EOS>
Stab
me
as
I
kneel

I
pray
to
you

<EOS>
You
can
not
kill
me
while
I
cling
to
you
thus
—
while
I
kiss
your
hands
—
while
I
bedew
them
with
my
tears

<EOS>
Those
tears
will
not
sully
them
like
my

""Maiden

Sybil
,
endeavoring
to

her

""Mercy!""It

<EOS>
""No

""I

said
Sybil
,
with
a
passionate
outburst
of
grief

<EOS>
"

Take
your

""Ah

exclaimed
Eleanor

"
all
rushes
back
upon
me
at
that
name

the
whole
of
that
fearful

in
review

""Do

""I

replied
the
gipsy
girl
,
stepping
forward
from
a
recess
,
in
which
she
had
hitherto
remained
unnoticed

<EOS>
"Enough

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
Tarry

<EOS>
Stir

Your

When

"
echoed
Eleanor
,
in
horror
.
<EOS>
"Be
calm

said
Sybil
.
<EOS>
"
When

They

they

find
me

your

<EOS>
Then
rush
to
him
—
to
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
He
will
protect
you
.
<EOS>
Say
to
him
hereafter
that
I
died
for
the
wrong
I
did
him
—
that
I
died
,
and
blessed
him

<EOS>
""Can
<EOS>
you
not
live
,
and
save
me
?
"
<EOS>
sobbed
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"Ask
<EOS>
it

<EOS>
While

your

also
—

<EOS>
that
groan!"All
started
,
as
a
deep
groan
knelled
in
their
ears
.
"Whence
<EOS>
comes
that
sound
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Sybil
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hist!—a
voice?""It
is
that
of

cried
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

he

cried
Sybil
:

fervently

your

down

down

down

<EOS>
Farewell

Handassah

"
<EOS>
And
breaking
from
them
,
she
rushed
into
the
darkest
recesses
of
the
vault
.
<EOS>
We
must
now
quit
this
painful
scene
for
another
scarcely
less
painful
,
and
return
to
the
unfortunate
priest
.
<EOS>
Checkley
had
been
brought
before
the
body
of
Susan
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
Even
in
the
gloom
,
the
shimmer
of
the
white
cereclothes
,
and
the
pallid
features
of
the
corpse
,
were
ghastly
enough
.
<EOS>
The
torchlight
made
them
terrible
.
"Kneel
!
"
said
Alan
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
The
priest
complied
.
<EOS>
Alan
knelt
beside
him
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
know
these
features
?
"
demanded
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Regard
them
well
.
<EOS>
Fix
your
eyes
full
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
them?""I
do
.
<EOS>
""Place
your
hand
upon
her
breast
.
<EOS>
Does
not
the
flesh
creep
and
shrink
beneath
your
touch
?
<EOS>
Now
raise
your
hand
—
make
the
cross
of
your
faith
upon
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
By
that
faith
you
swear
you
are
innocent
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
,
"
returned
the
priest
;
"
are
you
now
satisfied?""No
,
"
replied
Alan
.
<EOS>
"
Let
the
torch
be
removed
.
<EOS>
Your
innocence
must
be
more
deeply
attested
,
"
continued
he
,
as
the
light
was
withdrawn
.
<EOS>
"
This
proof
will
not
fail
.
<EOS>
Entwine
your
fingers
round
her
throat
.
<EOS>
""Have
<EOS>
I
not
done
enough?""Your
hesitation
<EOS>
proves
your
guilt
,
"
said
Alan
.
<EOS>
"That
<EOS>
proof
is
wanting
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
returned
the
priest
;
"
my
hand
is
upon
her
throat
—
what
more?""As
you
hope
for
mercy
in
your
hour
of
need
,
swear
that
you
never
conspired
against
her
life
,
or
refused
her
mercy
.
<EOS>
""I
swear
it
.
<EOS>
""May
<EOS>
the
dead
convict
you
of
perjury
if
you
have
forsworn
yourself
,
"
said
Alan
;
"
you
are
free
.
<EOS>
Take
away
your
hand!""Ha
!
<EOS>
what
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
put
some
jugglery
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
withdraw
my
hand
.
<EOS>
It
sticks
to
her
throat
,
as
though
'
twere
glued
by
blood
.
<EOS>
Tear
me
away
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
force
enough
to
liberate
myself
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
grin
at
me
?
<EOS>
The
corpse
grins
likewise
.
<EOS>
It
is
jugglery
.
<EOS>
I
am
innocent
.
<EOS>
You
would
take
away
my
life
.
<EOS>
Tear
me
away
,
I
say
:
the
veins
rise
;
they
blacken
;
they
are
filling
with
new
blood
.
<EOS>
I
feel
them
swell
;
they
coil
like
living
things
around
my
fingers
.
<EOS>
She
is
alive
.
<EOS>
""And
you
are
innocent?""I
am
—
I
am
.
<EOS>
Let
not
my
ravings
convict
me
.
<EOS>
For
Jesu
's
sake
,
release
me
.
<EOS>
""Blaspheme
<EOS>
not
,
but
arise
.
<EOS>
I
hold
you
not
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
,
"
groaned
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
grasp
tightens
round
my
throat
;
your
hard
and
skinny
fingers
are
there
—
<EOS>
I
strangle
—
<EOS>
help!""Your
<EOS>
own
fears
strangle
you
.
<EOS>
My
hand
is
at
my
side
,
"
returned
Alan
calmly
.
<EOS>
"Villain
,
you
lie
.
<EOS>
Your
grasp
is
like
a
vice
.
<EOS>
The
strength
of
a
thousand
devils
is
in
your
hand
.
<EOS>
Will
none
lend
help
?
<EOS>
I
never
pressed
so
hard
.
<EOS>
Your
daughter
never
suffered
this
torture
—
never
—
never
.
<EOS>
I
choke
—
choke
—
<EOS>
oh
!
"
<EOS>
And
the
priest
rolled
heavily
backwards
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
deep
groan
;
a
convulsive
rattle
in
the
throat
;
and
all
was
still
.
<EOS>
"He
is
dead
—
strangled
,
"
cried
several
voices
,
holding
down
the
torch
.
<EOS>
The
face
of
the
priest
was
blackened
and
contorted
;
his
eyeballs
protruded
from
their
sockets
;
his
tongue
was
nearly
bitten
through
in
the
desperate
efforts
he
had
made
to
release
himself
from
Alan
's
gripe
;
his
hair
was
erect
with
horror
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
ghastly
sight
.
<EOS>
A
murmur
arose
amongst
the
gipsies
.
<EOS>
Barbara
deemed
it
prudent
to
appease
them
.
<EOS>
"He
was
guilty
,
"
cried
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
was
the
murderer
of
Susan
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
,
her
father
,
have
avenged
her
,
"
said
Alan
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
The
dreadful
silence
that
followed
this
speech
was
broken
by
the
report
of
a
pistol
.
<EOS>
The
sound
,
though
startling
,
was
felt
almost
as
a
relief
.
<EOS>
"We
are
beset
,
"
cried
Alan
.
<EOS>
"
Some
of
you
fly
to
reconnoitre
.
<EOS>
""To
<EOS>
your
posts
,
"
cried
Barbara
.
<EOS>
Several
of
the
crew
flocked
to
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
"Unbind
<EOS>
the
prisoners
,
"
shouted
Alan
.
<EOS>
Mrs
.
<EOS>
Mowbray
and
Luke
were
accordingly
set
free
.
<EOS>
Two
almost
simultaneous
reports
of
a
pistol
were
now
heard
.
<EOS>
"'Tis
<EOS>
Ranulph
Rookwood
,
"
said
Alan
;
"
that
was
the
preconcerted
signal
.
<EOS>
""Ranulph
Rookwood
,
"
echoed
Eleanor
,
who
caught
the
exclamation
:
"
he
comes
to
save
me
.
<EOS>
""Remember
<EOS>
your
oath
,
"
gasped
a
dying
voice
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
no
longer
yours
.
<EOS>
""Alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
"
<EOS>
sobbed
Eleanor
,
tremblingly
.
<EOS>
A
moment
afterwards
a
faint
clapping
of
hands
reached
the
ears
of
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"All
<EOS>
is
over
,
"
muttered
she
.
"Ha
!
"
exclaimed
Alan
Rookwood
,
with
a
frightful
look
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
it
<EOS>
done?"Barbara
motioned
him
towards
the
further
end
of
the
vault
.

Look

here
comes
one
of
the
bloodhounds
of
justice
.
<EOS>
Schw
.
<EOS>
Down
with
him
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
him
utter
a
word

<EOS>
Moor
.
<EOS>
Silence
,
I
will
hear
him
.
<EOS>
Schiller
:
<EOS>
The
Robbers
.
<EOS>
GLADLY
do
we
now
exchange
the
dank
atmosphere
of
Saint
Cyprian
's
cell
,
and
the
horrors
which
have
detained
us
there
so
long
,
for
balmy
air
,
genial
sunshine
,
and
the
boon
companionship
of
Dick
Turpin
.
<EOS>
Upon
regaining
the
verdant
ruins
of
the
ancient
priory
,
all
appeared
pretty
much
as
our
highwayman
had
left
it
.
<EOS>
Dick
wended
towards
his
mare
.
<EOS>
Black
Bess
uttered
an
affectionate
whinnying
sound
as
he
approached
her
,
and
yielded
her
sleek
neck
to
his
caresses
.
<EOS>
No
Bedouin
Arab
ever
loved
his
horse
more
tenderly
than
Turpin
.
<EOS>
"'Twill
<EOS>
be
a
hard
day
when
thou
and
I
part
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
he
,
affectionately
patting
her
soft
and
silky
cheeks
.
<EOS>
Bess
thrust
her
nose
into
his
hand
,
biting
him
playfully
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
That
day
will
never
arrive
.
<EOS>
"
Turpin
,
at
least
,
understood
the
appeal
in
that
sense
;
he
was
skilled
in
the
language
of
the
Houyhnhnms
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
lose
my
right
hand
than
that
should
happen
,
"
sighed
he
;
"
but
there
's
no
saying
:
the
best
of
friends
must
part
;
and
thou
<EOS>
and
I
may
be
one
day
separated
:
<EOS>
thy
destination
is
the
knacker
—
mine
,
<EOS>
perhaps
,
the
gibbet.—We
are
neither
of
us
cut
out
for
old
age
<EOS>
,
that
's
certain
.
<EOS>
Curse
me
if
I
can
tell
how
it
is
;
since
I
've
been
in
that
vault
,
I
've
got
some
queer
crotchet
into
my
head
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
likening
thee
to
that
poor
gipsy
wench
,
Sybil
;
but
may
I
be
scragged
if
I
'd
use
thee
as
her
lover
has
used
her
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
he
,
drawing
a
pistol
with
a
suddenness
that
made
his
companions
,
Rust
and
Wilder
,
start
,
"
we
are
watched
.
<EOS>
See
you
not
how
yon
shadow
falls
from
behind
the
wall?""I
do
,
"
replied
Rust
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
varmint
shall
be
speedily
unearthed
,
"
said
Wilder
,
rushing
to
the
spot
.
<EOS>
In
another
instant
the
shadow
manifested
itself
in
a
substantial
little
personage
,
booted
,
spurred
,
and
mud
-
bespattered
.
<EOS>
He
was
brought
before
our
highwayman
,
who
had
,
meanwhile
,
vaulted
into
his
saddle
.
<EOS>
"Mr
.
<EOS>
Coates
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dick
,
bursting
into
a
loud
laugh
at
the
ridiculous
figure
presented
to
his
view
,
"
or
the
mud
deceives
me
.
<EOS>
""It
does
not
deceive
you
,
Captain
Turpin
,
"
replied
the
attorney
;
<EOS>
"
you
do
,
indeed
,
behold
that
twice
unfortunate
person
.
<EOS>
""What
brings
you
here
?
"
asked
Dick
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
see
,
you
are
come
to
pay
me
my
wager
.
<EOS>
""I
thought
you
gave
me
a
discharge
for
that
,
"
rejoined
Coates
,
unable
,
even
in
his
distress
,
to
resist
the
too
-
tempting
quibble
.
<EOS>
"True
,
but
it
was
in
blank
,
"
replied
Turpin
readily
;
"
and
that
do
n't
hold
good
in
law
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
You
have
thrown
away
a
second
chance
.
<EOS>
Play
or
pay
,
all
the
world
over
.
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
let
you
off
so
easily
this
time
,
depend
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Come
,
post
the
pony
,
or
take
your
measure
on
that
sod
.
<EOS>
No
more
replications
or
rejoinders
,
sir
,
down
with
the
dust
.
<EOS>
Fake
his
clies
,
pals

<EOS>
Let
us
see
what
he
has
about
him
.
<EOS>
""In
the
twinkling
of
a
bed
-
post
,
"
replied
Rust
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
turn
him
inside
out
.
<EOS>
What
's
here
?
"
<EOS>
cried
he
,
searching
the
attorney
's
pockets
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
brace
of
barkers

handing
a

of

""Three

muttered
Coates
<EOS>
;
"
the
knave
says
true
enough

<EOS>
""Is
there

"
demanded
Dick
.
<EOS>
"Only

a

,
sir

<EOS>
Here
's
pen
and
ink
.
<EOS>
Rascal
!
<EOS>
if
you
attempt
to
tear
the
bill
,
I
'll
blow
your
brains
out
.
<EOS>
Steady
,
sir
,
sign
.
<EOS>
Good
!
"
<EOS>
added
he
,
as
Coates
most
reluctantly
indorsed
the
bill
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
!
<EOS>
good
!
<EOS>
I
'll
be
off
with
this
bill
to
London
to
-
night
,
before
you
can
stop
it
.
<EOS>
No
courier
can
beat
Bess
—
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
Eh
!
<EOS>
what
's
this
?
"
<EOS>
continued
Dick
,
as
,
unfolding
another
leaf
of
the
pocket
-
book
,
he
chanced
upon
a
letter
;
"
My
Lady
Rookwood
's
superscription
!
<EOS>
Excuse
me
,
Mr.
Coates
,
I
must
have
a
peep
at
her
ladyship
's
billet
-
doux
.
<EOS>
All
's
safe
with
me
—
man
of
honor
.
<EOS>
I
must
detain
your
reader
a
moment
longer
.
<EOS>
""You
should
take
charge
of
yourself
,
then
,
"
replied
Coates
,
sulkily
.
<EOS>
"
You
appear
to
be
my
reader
.
<EOS>
""Bravo
!
"
cried
Turpin
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
jest
now
with
impunity
,
Mr.
Coates
.
<EOS>
You
have
paid
dear
enough
for
your
jokes
;
and
when
should
a
man
be
allowed
to
be
pleasant
,
if
not
at
his
own
expense?—ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
What
's
this
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
he
,
opening
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
ring
,
as
I
'm
awake
!
<EOS>
and
from
her
ladyship
's
own
fair
finger
,
I
'll
be
sworn
,
for
it
bears
her
cipher
,
ineffaceably
impressed
as
your
image
upon
her
heart
—
eh
,
Coates
?
<EOS>
Egad
!
<EOS>
you
are
a
lucky
dog
,
after
all
,
to
receive
such
a
favor
from
such
a
lady
—
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
Meantime
,
I
'll
take
care
of
it
for
you
,
"
continued
Dick
,
slipping
the
ring
on
his
little
finger
.
<EOS>
Turpin
,
we
have
before
remarked
,
had
a
turn
for
mimicry
;
and
it
was
with
an
irresistible
feeling
of
deferential
awe
creeping
over
him
that
Coates
heard
the
contents
of
Lady
Rookwood
's
epistle
delivered
with
an
enunciation
as
peremptory
and
imperious
as
that
of
her
ladyship
's
self
.
<EOS>
The
letter
was
hastily
indited
,
in
a
clear
,
firm
hand
,
and
partook
of
its
writer
's
decision
of
character
.
<EOS>
Dick
found
no
difficulty
in
deciphering
it
.
<EOS>
Thus
ran
the
missive:"Assured
of
your
devotion
and
secrecy
,
I
commit
my
own
honor
,
and
that
of
my
son
,
to
your
charge
.
<EOS>
Time
will
not
permit
me
to
see
you
,
or
I
would
not
write
.
<EOS>
But
I
place
myself
entirely
in
your
hands
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
dare
to
betray
my
confidence
.
<EOS>
To
the
point:—A
Major
Mowbray
has
just
arrived
here
with
intelligence
that
the
body
of
Susan
Bradley
—
you
will
know
to
whom
I
allude
—
has
been
removed
from
our
family
vault
by
a
Romish
priest
and
his
assistants
.
<EOS>
How
it
came
there
,
or
why
it
has
been
removed
,
I
know
not
;
it
is
not
my
present
purpose
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
Suffice
it
,
that
it
now
lies
in
a
vault
beneath
the
ruins
of
Davenham
Priory
.
<EOS>
My
son
,
Sir
Ranulph
,
who
has
lent
a
credulous
ear
to
the
artful
tales
of
the
impostor
who
calls
this
woman
mother
,
is
at
present
engaged
in
arming
certain
of
the
household
,
and
of
the
tenantry
,
to
seize
upon
and
bring
away
this
body
,
as
resistance
is
apprehended
from
a
horde
of
gipsies
who
infest
the
ruins
.
<EOS>
Now
,
mark
me
.
<EOS>
That
body
must
not
be
found
!
<EOS>
Be
it
your
business
to
prevent
its
discovery
.
<EOS>
Take
the
fleetest
horse
you
can
procure
;
spare
neither
whip
nor
spur
.
<EOS>
Haste
to
the
priory
;
procure
by
any
means
,
and
at
any
expense
,
the
assistance
of
the
gipsies
.
<EOS>
Find
out
the
body
<EOS>
;
conceal
it
,
destroy
it
—
do
what
you
will
,
so
my
son
find
it
not
.
<EOS>
Fear
not
his
resentment
;
I
will
bear
you
harmless
of
the
consequences
with
him
.
<EOS>
You
will
act
upon
my
responsibility
.
<EOS>
I
pledge
my
honor
for
your
safety
.
<EOS>
Use
all
despatch
,
and
calculate
upon
due
requital
from"Maud
Rookwood
.
"Haste
,
and
God
speed
you!""God
<EOS>
speed
you
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Dick
,
in
his
own
voice
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
The
devil
drive
you
!
<EOS>
would
have
been
a
fitter
postscript
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
upon
this
precious
errand
<EOS>
you
came
,
Mr.
Coates?""Precisely
,
"
replied
the
attorney
;
"
but
I
find
the
premises
preoccupied
.
<EOS>
Fast
as
I
have
ridden
,
you
are
here
before
me
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
what
do
you
now
propose
to
do
?
"
asked
Turpin
.
"Bargain
<EOS>
with
you
for
the
body
,
"
replied
Coates
,
in
an
insinuating
tone
.
<EOS>
"With
me
!
"
<EOS>
said
Dick
;
"
do
you
take
me
for
a
resurrection
cove
;
for
a
dealer
in
dead
stock
,
eh
!
sirrah?""I
take
you
for
one
sufficiently
alive
,
in
a
general
way
,
to
his
own
interests
,
"
returned
Coates
.
<EOS>
"
These
gentlemen
may
not
,
perhaps
,
be
quite
so
scrupulous
,
when
they
hear
my
proposals
.
<EOS>
""Be
silent
,
sir
,
"
interrupted
Turpin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hist
!
<EOS>
I
hear
the
tramp
of
horses
'
hoofs
without
.
<EOS>
Hark
!
<EOS>
that
shout
.
<EOS>
""Make
<EOS>
your
own
terms
before
they
come
,
"
said
Coates
.
<EOS>
"
Leave
all
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
'll
put
'em
on
a
wrong
scent
.
<EOS>
""To
<EOS>
the
devil
with
your
terms
,
"
cried
Turpin
;
"
the
signal
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
pulled
the
trigger
of
one
of
Coates
's
pistols
,
the
shot
of
which
rang
in
the
ears
of
the
astounded
attorney
as
it
whizzed
past
him
.
"
<EOS>
Drag
him
into
the
mouth
of
the
vault
,
"
thundered
Turpin
:
"
he
will
be
a
capital
cover
in
case
of
attack
.
<EOS>
Look
to
your
sticks
,
and
be
on
the
alert;—away!"Vainly
<EOS>
did
the
unfortunate
attorney
kick
and
struggle
,
swear
and
scream
;
his
hat
was
pushed
over
his
eyes
;
his
bob
-
wig
thrust
into
his
mouth
;
and
his
legs
tripped
from
under
him
.
<EOS>
Thus
blind
,
dumb
,
and
half
-
suffocated
,
he
was
hurried
into
the
entrance
of
the
cell
.
<EOS>
Dick
,
meanwhile
,
dashed
to
the
arched
outlet
of
the
ruin
.
<EOS>
He
there
drew
in
the
rein
,
and
Black
Bess
stood
motionless
as
a
statue
.

CHAPTER
XIV
.
<EOS>
—
DICK
TURPINMany
<EOS>
a
fine
fellow
with
a
genius
extensive
enough
to
have
effected
universal
reformation
has
been
doomed
to
perish
by
the
halter
.
<EOS>
But
does
not
such
a
man
's
renown
extend
through
centuries
and
tens
of
centuries
,
while
many
a
prince
would
be
overlooked
in
history
were
it
not
the
historian
's
interest
to
increase
the
number
of
his
pages
?
<EOS>
Nay
,
when
the
traveller
sees
a
gibbet
,
does
he
not
exclaim
,
"
That
fellow
was
no
fool
!
"
and
lament
the
hardship
of
the
times?—Schiller
:
<EOS>
The
Robbers
.
<EOS>
TURPIN
'S
quick
eye
ranged
over
the
spreading
sward
in
front
of
the
ancient
priory
,
and
his
brow
became
contracted
.
<EOS>
The
feeling
,
however
,
was
transient
.
<EOS>
The
next
instant
saw
him
the
same
easy
,
reckless
being
he
had
been
before
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
more
paleness
in
his
cheek
than
usual
;
but
his
look
was
keener
,
and
his
knees
involuntarily
clasped
the
saddle
more
firmly
.
<EOS>
No
other
symptom
of
anxiety
was
perceptible
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
no
impeachment
to
Dick
's
valor
were
it
necessary
to
admit
that
a
slight
tremor
crossed
him
as
he
scanned
the
formidable
array
of
his
opponents
.
<EOS>
The
admission
is
needless
.
<EOS>
Dick
himself
would
have
been
the
last
man
to
own
it
;
nor
shall
we
do
the
memory
of
our
undaunted
highwayman
any
such
injustice
.
<EOS>
Turpin
was
intrepid
to
a
fault
.
<EOS>
He
was
rash
;
apt
to
run
into
risks
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
getting
out
of
them
:
danger
was
his
delight
,
and
the
degree
of
excitement
was
always
in
proportion
to
the
peril
incurred
.
<EOS>
After
the
first
glance
,
he
became
,
to
use
his
own
expressive
phrase
,
"
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
;
"
and
continued
,
as
long
as
they
permitted
him
,
like
a
skilful
commander
,
calmly
to
calculate
the
numerical
strength
of
his
adversaries
,
and
to
arrange
his
own
plan
of
resistance
.
<EOS>
This
troop
of
horsemen
,
for
such
it
was
,
might
probably
amount
in
the
aggregate
to
twenty
men
,
and
presented
an
appearance
like
that
of
a
strong
muster
at
a
rustic
fox
-
chase
,
due
allowance
being
made
for
the
various
weapons
of
offence
;
to
-
wit
:
<EOS>
naked
sabers
,
firelocks
,
and
a
world
of
huge
horse
-
pistols
,
which
the
present
field
carried
along
with
them
.
<EOS>
This
resemblance
was
heightened
by
the
presence
of
an
old
huntsman
and
a
gamekeeper
or
two
,
in
scarlet
and
green
jackets
,
and
a
few
yelping
hounds
that
had
followed
after
them
.
<EOS>
The
majority
of
the
crew
consisted
of
sturdy
yeomen
;
some
of
whom
,
mounted
upon
wild
,
unbroken
colts
,
had
pretty
lives
of
it
to
maintain
their
seats
,
and
curvetted
about
in
"
most
admired
disorder
;
"
others
were
seated
upon
more
docile
,
but
quite
as
provoking
specimens
of
the
cart
-
horse
breed
,
whose
sluggish
sides
,
reckless
alike
of
hobnailed
heel
or
ash
sapling
,
refused
to
obey
their
riders
'
intimations
to
move
;
while
others
again
,
brought
stiff
,
wrong
-
headed
ponies
to
the
charge
—
obstinate
,
impracticable
little
brutes
,
who
seemed
to
prefer
revolving
on
their
own
axis
,
and
describing
absurd
rotatory
motions
,
to
proceeding
in
the
direct
and
proper
course
pointed
out
to
them
.
<EOS>
Dick
could
scarcely
forbear
laughing
at
these
ridiculous
manoeuvres
;
but
his
attention
was
chiefly
attracted
towards
three
individuals
,
who
were
evidently
the
leaders
of
this
warlike
expedition
.
<EOS>
In
the
thin
,
tall
figure
of
the
first
of
these
he
recognized
Ranulph
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
With
the
features
and
person
of
the
second
of
the
group
he
was
not
entirely
unacquainted
,
and
fancied
—
nor
incorrectly
fancied
—
that
his
military
bearing
,
or
,
as
he
would
have
expressed
it
,
"
the
soldier
-
like
cut
of
his
jib
,
"
could
belong
to
no
other
than
Major
Mowbray
,
whom
he
had
once
eased
of
a
purse
on
Finchley
Common
.
<EOS>
In
the
round
,
rosy
countenance
and
robustious
person
of
the
last
of
the
trio
he
discovered
his
ancient
ally
,
Titus
Tyrconnel
.
<EOS>
"Ah
,
Titus
,
my
jewel
<EOS>
,
are
you
there
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Dick
,
as
he
distinguished
the
Irishman
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
I
have
one
friend
among
them
whom
I
may
welcome
.
<EOS>
So
,
they
see
me
now
.
<EOS>
Off
they
come
,
pell
-
mell
.
<EOS>
Back
,
Bess
,
back!—slowly
,
wench
,
slowly
—
there
—
stand
!
"
<EOS>
And
Bess
again
remained
motionless
.
<EOS>
The
report
of
Turpin
's
pistol
reached
the
ears
of
the
troop
;
and
as
all
were
upon
the
alert
,
he
had
scarcely
presented
himself
at
the
gateway
,
when
a
loud
shout
was
raised
,
and
the
whole
cavalcade
galloped
towards
him
,
creating
,
as
may
be
imagined
,
the
wildest
disorder
;
each
horseman
yelling
,
as
he
neared
the
arch
,
and
got
involved
in
the
press
occasioned
by
the
unexpected
concentration
of
forces
at
that
point
,
while
oaths
and
blows
,
kicks
and
cuffs
,
were
reciprocated
with
such
hearty
good
-
will
,
that
,
had
Turpin
ever
read
Ariosto
or
Cervantes
,
or
heard
of
the
discord
of
King
Agramante
's
camp
,
this
mêlée
must
have
struck
him
as
its
realization
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
entertaining
little
apprehension
of
the
result
,
he
shouted
encouragement
to
them
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
,
however
,
had
the
foremost
horseman
disentangled
himself
from
the
crowd
,
and
,
struggling
to
the
door
,
was
in
the
act
of
levelling
his
pistol
at
Turpin
's
head
,
when
a
well
-
directed
ball
pierced
the
brain
of
his
charger
,
and
horse
and
man
rolled
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Vowing
vengeance
,
a
second
succeeded
,
and
was
in
like
manner
compelled
to
bite
the
dust
.
<EOS>
"That
will
let
Old
Peter
know
that
Ranulph
Rookwood
is
at
hand
,
"
exclaimed
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
I
sha
n't
throw
away
another
shot
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
scene
at
the
archway
was
now
one
of
complete
confusion
.
<EOS>
Terrified
by
the
shots
,
some
of
the
boors
would
have
drawn
back
,
while
others
,
in
mid
career
,
advanced
,
and
propelled
them
forwards
.
<EOS>
It
was
like
the
meeting
of
two
tides
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
,
regardless
of
the
bit
,
and
scared
by
the
firing
,
a
wild
colt
broke
all
bounds
,
and
,
hurling
his
rider
in
the
air
,
darted
off
into
the
green
;
or
,
in
another
case
,
rushed
forward
,
and
encountering
the
prostrate
cattle
cumbering
the
entrance
to
the
priory
hall
,
stumbled
,
and
precipitated
his
master
neck
-
over
-
heels
at
the
very
feet
of
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
During
all
this
tumult
,
a
few
shots
were
fired
at
the
highwayman
,
which
,
without
doing
him
a
jot
of
mischief
,
tended
materially
to
increase
their
own
confusion
.
<EOS>
The
voice
of
Turpin
was
now
heard
above
the
din
and
turmoil
to
sound
a
parley
;
and
as
he
appeared
disposed
to
offer
no
opposition
,
some
of
his
antagonists
ventured
to
raise
themselves
from
the
ground
,
and
to
approach
him
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
demand
to
be
led
to
Sir
Ranulph
Rookwood
,
"
said
Turpin
.
<EOS>
"He
is
here
,
"
said
Ranulph
,
riding
up
.
<EOS>
"
Villain
,
you
are
my
prisoner
.
<EOS>
""As
<EOS>
you
list
,
Sir
Ranulph
,
"
returned
Dick
,
coolly
;
"
but
let
me
have
a
word
in
private
with
<EOS>
you
ere
<EOS>
you
do
aught
you
may
repent
hereafter
.
<EOS>
""No
words
,
sir
—
deliver
up
your
arms
,
or——""My
pistols
are
at
your
service
,
"
replied
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
discharged
them
.
<EOS>
""You
may
have
others
.
<EOS>
We
must
search
you
.
<EOS>
""Hold
!
"
cried
Dick
;
"
if
you
will
not
listen
to
me
,
read
that
paper
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
handed
Ranulph
his
mother
's
letter
to
Mr.
Coates
.
<EOS>
It
was
without
the
superscription
,
which
he
had
thrown
aside
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
mother
's
hand
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Ranulph
,
reddening
with
anger
,
as
he
hastily
perused
its
contents
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
sent
this
to
you
?
<EOS>
You
lie
,
villain—'tis
a
forgery
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
this
speak
for
me
,
"
returned
Dick
,
holding
out
the
finger
upon
which
Lady
Rookwood
's
ring
was
placed
.
"
<EOS>
Know
you
that
cipher?""You
have
stolen
it
,
"
retorted
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
mother
,
"
added
he
,
in
a
deep
,
stern
whisper
,
articulated
only
for
Turpin
's
hearing
,
"
would
never
have
entrusted
her
honor
to
a
highwayman
's
keeping
.
<EOS>
""She
has
entrusted
more
—
her
life
,
"
replied
Dick
,
in
a
careless
tone
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
have
bribed
me
to
do
murder
.
<EOS>
""Murder
!
"
echoed
Ranulph
,
aghast
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
to
murder
your
brother
,
"
returned
Dick
;
"
but
let
that
pass
.
<EOS>
You
have
read
that
note
.
<EOS>
I
have
acted
solely
upon
your
mother
's
responsibility
.
<EOS>
Lady
Rookwood
's
honor
is
pledged
for
my
safety
.
<EOS>
Of
course
her
son
will
set
me
free
.
<EOS>
""Never!""Well
,
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
Your
mother
is
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
Betray
me
,
and
you
betray
her
.
<EOS>
""No
more
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Ranulph
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
Go
your
ways
.
<EOS>
You
are
free
.
<EOS>
""Pledge
me
<EOS>
your
word
of
honor
<EOS>
I
am
safe
.
<EOS>
"
Ranulph
had
scarcely
given
his
pledge
,
when
Major
Mowbray
rode
furiously
up
.
<EOS>
A
deep
flush
of
anger
burnt
upon
his
cheeks
;
his
sword
was
drawn
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
glanced
at
Turpin
,
as
if
he
would
have
felled
him
from
his
saddle
.
<EOS>
"This
is
the
ruffian
,
"
cried
the
major
,
fiercely
,
"
by
whom
I
was
attacked
some
months
ago
,
and
for
whose
apprehension
the
reward
of
three
hundred
pounds
is
offered
by
his
majesty
's
proclamation
,
with
a
free
pardon
to
his
accomplices
.
<EOS>
This
is
Richard
Turpin
.
<EOS>
He
has
just
added
another
crime
to
his
many
offences
.
<EOS>
He
has
robbed
my
mother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
The
postboy
knew
him
the
moment
he
came
up
.
<EOS>
Where
are
they
,
villain
?
<EOS>
Whither
are
they
gone?—answer!""I
know
not
,
"
replied
Turpin
,
calmly
.
<EOS>
"
Did
not
the
lad
tell
you
they
were
rescued?""Rescued!—by
whom
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Ranulph
,
with
great
emotion
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
one
who
calls
himself
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
,
"
answered
Turpin
,
with
a
meaning
smile
.
<EOS>
"By
him
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"
Where
are
they
now?""I
have
already
answered
that
question
,
"
said
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
,
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
are
my
prisoner
,
"
cried
the
major
,
seizing
Turpin
's
bridle
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
Sir
Ranulph
's
word
for
my
safety
,
"
rejoined
Turpin
.
<EOS>
"
Let
go
my
rein
.
<EOS>
""How
is
this
?
"
asked
Major
Mowbray
,
incredulously
.
"Ask
<EOS>
me
not
.
<EOS>
Release
him
,
"
replied
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"Ranulph
,
"
said
the
major
,
"
you
ask
an
impossibility
.
<EOS>
My
honor
—
my
duty
—
is
implicated
in
this
man
's
capture
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
honor
of
all
of
us
is
involved
in
his
deliverance
,
"
returned
Ranulph
,
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
Let
him
go
.
<EOS>
I
will
explain
all
hereafter
.
<EOS>
Let
us
search
for
them
—
for
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
Surely
,
after
this
,
you
will
help
us
to
find
them
,
"
added
he
,
addressing
Turpin
.
<EOS>
"I
wish
,
with
all
my
soul
,
I
could
do
so
,
"
replied
the
highwayman
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
see'd
<EOS>
the
ladies
cross
the
brook
,
and
enter
these
old
ruins
,
"
interposed
the
postboy
,
who
had
now
joined
the
party
.
<EOS>
"
I
see'd
'em
from
where
I
stood
on
the
hill
-
side
;
and
as
I
kept
a
pretty
sharp
look
-
out
,
and
have
a
tolerably
bright
eye
of
my
own
,
I
do
n't
think
as
how
they
ever
comed
out
again
.
<EOS>
""Some
one
is
hidden
within
yon
fissure
in
the
wall
,
"
exclaimed
Ranulph
;
"
I
see
a
figure
move
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
flung
himself
from
his
horse
,
rushing
towards
the
mouth
of
the
cell
.
<EOS>
Imitating
his
example
,
Major
Mowbray
followed
his
friend
,
sword
in
hand
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
game
begins
now
in
right
earnest
,
"
said
Dick
to
himself
;
"
the
old
fox
will
be
soon
unearthed
.
<EOS>
I
must
look
to
my
snappers
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
thrust
his
hand
quietly
into
his
pocket
in
search
of
a
pistol
.
<EOS>
Just
as
Ranulph
and
the
major
reached
the
recess
they
were
startled
by
the
sudden
apparition
of
the
ill
-
fated
attorney
.
<EOS>
"Mr
.
<EOS>
Coates
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Ranulph
,
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
here
,
sir?""I
—
<EOS>
I
—
that
is
—
Sir
Ranulph
—
you
must
excuse
me
,
sir
—
particular
business
—
can't
say
,
"
returned
the
trembling
attorney
;
for
at
this
instant
his
eye
caught
that
of
Turpin
,
and
the
ominous
reflexion
of
a
polished
-
steel
barrel
,
held
carelessly
towards
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
aware
,
also
,
that
on
the
other
hand
he
was
,
in
like
manner
,
the
mark
of
Rust
and
Wilder
;
those
polite
gentlemen
having
threatened
him
with
a
brace
of
slugs
in
his
brain
if
he
dared
to
betray
their
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
necessary
that
I
should
be
guarded
in
my
answers
,
"
murmured
he
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
there
any
one
within
that
place
besides
yourself
?
"
said
the
major
,
making
a
movement
thither
.
<EOS>
"No
,
sir
,
nobody
at
all
,
"
answered
Coates
,
hastily
,
fancying
at
the
same
time
that
he
heard
the
click
of
the
pistol
that
was
to
be
his
death
-
warrant
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
came
you
here
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
mean
in
this
identical
spot
?
"
replied
Coates
,
evasively
.
<EOS>
"You
can
have
no
difficulty
in
answering
that
question
,
"
said
the
major
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"Pardon
<EOS>
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
find
considerable
difficulty
in
answering
any
question
,
situated
as
I
am
.
<EOS>
""Have
<EOS>
you
seen
Miss
Mowbray
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Ranulph
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"Or
<EOS>
my
mother
?
"
said
the
major
,
in
the
same
breath
.
<EOS>
"Neither
,
"
replied
Coates
,
rather
relieved
by
these
questions
.
<EOS>
"I
suspect
you
are
deceiving
us
,
sir
,
"
said
the
major
.
<EOS>
"
Your
manner
is
confused
.
<EOS>
I
am
convinced
you
know
more
of
this
matter
than
you
choose
to
explain
;
and
if
you
do
not
satisfy
me
at
once
,
fully
and
explicitly
,
I
vow
to
Heaven
—
—
"
and
the
major
's
sword
described
a
glittering
circle
round
his
head
.
<EOS>
"Are
<EOS>
you
privy
to
their
concealment
?
"
asked
Ranulph
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
aught
of
them
,
or
of
Luke
Bradley?""Speak
,
or
this
moment
is
your
last
,
"
said
the
major
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
it
is
my
last
,
I
can
not
speak
,
"
returned
Coates
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
your
questions
,
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
you
positively
assure
me
you
have
not
seen
Mrs.
Mowbray
and
her
daughter
?
"
said
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
Turpin
here
winked
at
Coates
.
<EOS>
The
attorney
understood
him
.
<EOS>
"I
do
n't
positively
assert
that
,
"
faltered
he
.
<EOS>
"How!—you
have
seen
them
?
"
shouted
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"Where
<EOS>
are
they?—in
safety
—
speak
!
<EOS>
"
added
the
major
.
<EOS>
Another
expressive
gesture
from
the
highwayman
communicated
to
the
attorney
the
nature
of
his
reply
.
<EOS>
"Without
,
sir
—
without
—
yonder
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
show
you
myself
.
<EOS>
Follow
,
gentlemen
,
follow
.
"
<EOS>
And
away
scampered
Coates
,
without
once
venturing
to
look
behind
him
.
<EOS>
In
an
instant
the
ruined
hall
was
deserted
,
and
Turpin
alone
left
behind
.
<EOS>
In
the
excitement
of
the
moment
his
presence
had
been
forgotten
.
<EOS>
In
an
instant
afterwards
the
arena
was
again
occupied
by
a
company
equally
numerous
.
<EOS>
Rust
and
Wilder
issued
from
their
hiding
-
places
,
followed
by
a
throng
of
the
gipsy
crew
.
<EOS>
"Where
<EOS>
is
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
?
"
asked
Turpin
.
<EOS>
"He
remains
below
,
"
was
the
answer
returned
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
Peter
<EOS>
Bradley?""Stays
<EOS>
there
likewise
.
<EOS>
""No
matter
.
<EOS>
Now
make
ready
,
pals
.
<EOS>
Give
'em
one
shout
—
Hurrah!""Hurrah
!
<EOS>
"
replied
the
crowd
,
at
the
top
of
their
voices
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
Rookwood
and
his
companions
heard
this
shout
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Coates
had
already
explained
the
stratagem
practised
upon
them
by
the
wily
highwayman
,
as
well
as
the
perilous
situation
in
which
he
himself
had
been
placed
;
and
they
were
in
the
act
of
returning
to
make
good
his
capture
,
when
the
loud
shouts
of
the
crew
arrested
them
.
<EOS>
From
the
clamor
,
it
was
evident
that
considerable
reinforcement
must
have
arrived
from
some
unlooked
-
for
quarter
;
and
,
although
burning
to
be
avenged
upon
the
audacious
highwayman
,
the
major
felt
it
would
be
a
task
of
difficulty
,
and
that
extreme
caution
could
alone
ensure
success
.
<EOS>
With
difficulty
restraining
the
impatience
of
Ranulph
,
who
could
scarcely
brook
these
few
minutes
of
needful
delay
,
Major
Mowbray
gave
particular
instructions
to
each
of
the
men
in
detail
,
and
caused
several
of
them
to
dismount
.
<EOS>
By
this
arrangement
Mr.
Coates
found
himself
accommodated
with
a
steed
and
a
pair
of
pistols
,
with
which
latter
he
vowed
to
wreak
his
vengeance
upon
some
of
his
recent
tormentors
.
<EOS>
After
a
short
space
of
time
occupied
in
this
manner
,
the
troop
slowly
advanced
towards
the
postern
,
in
much
better
order
than
upon
the
previous
occasion
;
but
the
stoutest
of
them
quailed
as
they
caught
sight
of
the
numerous
gipsy
-
gang
drawn
out
in
battle
array
within
the
abbey
walls
.
<EOS>
Each
party
scanned
the
other
's
movements
in
silence
and
wonder
,
anxiously
awaiting
,
yet
in
a
measure
dreading
,
their
leader
's
signal
to
begin
.
<EOS>
That
signal
was
not
long
delayed
.
<EOS>
A
shot
from
the
ranks
of
Rookwood
did
instant
and
bitter
execution
.
<EOS>
Rob
Rust
was
stretched
lifeless
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Nothing
more
was
needed
.
<EOS>
The
action
now
became
general
.
<EOS>
Fire
arms
were
discharged
on
both
sides
,
without
much
damage
to
either
party
.
<EOS>
But
a
rush
being
made
by
a
detachment
of
horse
,
headed
by
Major
Mowbray
,
the
conflict
soon
became
more
serious
.
<EOS>
The
gipsies
,
after
the
first
fire
,
threw
aside
their
pistols
,
and
fought
with
long
knives
,
with
which
they
inflicted
desperate
gashes
,
both
on
men
and
horses
.
<EOS>
Major
Mowbray
was
slightly
wounded
in
the
thigh
,
and
his
steed
receiving
the
blow
intended
for
himself
,
stumbled
and
threw
his
rider
.
<EOS>
Luckily
for
the
major
,
Ranulph
Rookwood
was
at
hand
,
and
with
the
butt
-
end
of
a
heavy
-
handled
pistol
felled
the
ruffian
to
the
earth
,
just
as
he
was
upon
the
point
of
repeating
the
thrust
.
<EOS>
Turpin
,
meanwhile
,
had
taken
comparatively
a
small
share
in
the
conflict
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
content
himself
with
acting
upon
the
defensive
,
and
except
in
the
case
of
Titus
Tyrconnel
,
whom
,
espying
amidst
the
crowd
,
he
had
considerably
alarmed
by
sending
a
bullet
through
his
wig
,
he
did
not
fire
a
single
shot
.
<EOS>
He
also
succeeded
in
unhorsing
Coates
,
by
hurling
,
with
great
dexterity
,
the
empty
pistol
at
his
head
.
<EOS>
Though
apparently
unconcerned
in
the
skirmish
,
he
did
not
flinch
from
it
,
but
kept
his
ground
unyieldingly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
charmed
life
<EOS>
"
he
seemed
to
bear
;
for
amid
the
shower
of
bullets
,
many
of
which
were
especially
aimed
at
himself
,
he
came
off
unhurt
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
that
's
born
to
be
hanged
will
never
be
drowned
<EOS>
,
that
's
certain
,
"
said
Titus
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
use
trying
to
bring
him
down
.
<EOS>
But
,
by
Jasus
!
<EOS>
he
's
spoiled
my
best
hat
and
wig
,
anyhow
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
hole
in
my
beaver
as
big
as
a
crown
piece
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
own
crown
's
safe
,
and
that
's
some
satisfaction
,
"
said
Coates
;
"
whereas
mine
has
a
bump
on
it
as
large
as
a
swan
's
egg
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
if
we
could
only
get
behind
him
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
strife
continued
to
rage
without
intermission
;
and
though
there
were
now
several
ghastly
evidences
of
its
fury
,
in
the
shape
of
wounded
men
and
slaughtered
or
disabled
horses
,
whose
gaping
wounds
flooded
the
turf
with
gore
,
it
was
still
difficult
to
see
upon
which
side
victory
would
eventually
declare
herself
.
<EOS>
The
gipsies
,
though
by
far
the
greater
sufferers
of
the
two
,
firmly
maintained
their
ground
.
<EOS>
Drenched
in
the
blood
of
the
horses
they
had
wounded
,
and
brandishing
their
long
knives
,
they
presented
a
formidable
and
terrific
appearance
,
the
effect
of
which
was
not
at
all
diminished
by
their
wild
yells
and
savage
gesticulations
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
headed
by
Major
Mowbray
and
Ranulph
,
the
troop
of
yeomen
pressed
on
undauntedly
;
and
where
the
sturdy
farmers
could
get
a
firm
gripe
of
their
lithe
antagonists
,
or
deliver
a
blow
with
their
ox
-
like
fists
,
they
seldom
failed
to
make
good
the
advantages
which
superior
weight
and
strength
gave
them
.
<EOS>
It
will
thus
be
seen
that
as
yet
they
were
pretty
well
matched
.
<EOS>
Numbers
were
in
favor
of
the
gipsies
,
but
courage
was
equally
distributed
,
and
,
perhaps
,
what
is
emphatically
called
"
bottom
,
"
was
in
favor
of
the
rustics
.
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
from
what
had
already
occurred
,
there
was
every
prospect
of
a
very
serious
termination
to
the
fray
.
<EOS>
From
time
to
time
Turpin
glanced
to
the
entrance
of
the
cell
,
in
the
expectation
of
seeing
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
make
his
appearance
;
and
,
as
he
was
constantly
disappointed
in
his
expectation
,
he
could
not
conceal
his
chagrin
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
resolved
to
despatch
a
messenger
to
him
,
and
one
of
the
crew
accordingly
departed
upon
this
errand
.
<EOS>
He
returned
presently
with
a
look
of
blank
dismay
.
<EOS>
In
our
hasty
narrative
of
the
fight
we
have
not
paused
to
particularize
,
neither
have
we
enumerated
,
the
list
of
the
combatants
.
<EOS>
Amongst
them
,
however
,
were
Jerry
Juniper
,
the
knight
of
Malta
,
and
Zoroaster
.
<EOS>
Excalibur
,
as
may
be
conceived
,
had
not
been
idle
;
but
that
trenchant
blade
had
been
shivered
by
Ranulph
Rookwood
in
the
early
stage
of
the
business
,
and
the
knight
left
weaponless
.
<EOS>
Zoroaster
,
who
was
not
merely
a
worshipper
of
fire
,
but
a
thorough
milling
-
cove
,
had
engaged
to
some
purpose
in
a
pugilistic
encounter
with
the
rustics
;
and
,
having
fought
several
rounds
,
now
"
bore
his
blushing
honors
thick
upon
him
.
"
<EOS>
Jerry
,
like
Turpin
,
had
remained
tolerably
quiescent
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
proper
moment
,
"
he
said
,
"
had
not
arrived
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
fatality
seemed
to
attend
Turpin
's
immediate
companions
.
<EOS>
Rust
was
the
first
who
fell
;
Wilder
also
was
now
among
the
slain
.
<EOS>
Things
were
precisely
in
this
condition
when
the
messenger
returned
.
<EOS>
A
marked
change
was
instantly
perceptible
in
Turpin
's
manner
.
<EOS>
He
no
longer
looked
on
with
indifference
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
angry
and
distrustful
.
<EOS>
He
gnawed
his
lip
,
ever
a
sign
with
him
of
vexation
.
<EOS>
Addressing
a
few
words
to
those
about
him
,
he
then
spoke
more
loudly
to
the
rest
of
the
crew
.
<EOS>
Being
in
the
jargon
of
the
tawny
tribe
,
his
words
were
not
intelligible
to
the
opposite
party
;
but
their
import
was
soon
made
known
by
the
almost
instant
and
total
relinquishment
of
the
field
by
the
gipsies
.
<EOS>
They
took
to
their
heels
at
once
,
to
a
man
,
leaving
only
a
few
desperately
wounded
behind
them
;
and
,
flying
along
the
intricate
ruins
of
the
priory
,
baffled
all
pursuit
,
wherever
it
was
attempted
.
<EOS>
Jerry
Juniper
was
the
last
in
the
retreat
;
but
,
upon
receiving
a
hint
from
Dick
,
he
vaulted
like
a
roe
over
the
heads
of
his
adversaries
,
and
made
good
his
escape
.
<EOS>
Turpin
alone
remained
.
<EOS>
He
stood
like
a
lion
at
bay
,
quietly
regarding
the
huntsmen
hurtling
around
him
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
Rookwood
rode
up
and
bade
him
surrender
.
<EOS>
"Detain
<EOS>
me
not
,
"
cried
he
,
in
a
voice
of
thunder
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
would
save
her
who
is
dear
to
you
,
descend
into
that
vault
.
<EOS>
Off
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
Turpin
shook
away
,
with
ease
,
the
grasp
that
Ranulph
had
laid
upon
him
.
"Villain
!
<EOS>
you
do
not
escape
me
this
time
,
"
said
Major
Mowbray
,
interposing
himself
between
Turpin
and
the
outlet
.
<EOS>
"Major
<EOS>
Mowbray
,
I
would
not
have
your
blood
upon
my
head
,
"
said
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
pass
,
"
and
he
levelled
a
pistol
.
<EOS>
"Fire
,
if
you
dare
!
"
said
the
major
,
raising
his
sword
.
<EOS>
"
You
pass
not
.
<EOS>
I
will
die
rather
than
allow
you
to
escape
.
<EOS>
Barricade
the
door
.
<EOS>
Strike
him
down
if
he
attempts
to
pass
.
<EOS>
Richard
Turpin
,
I
arrest
you
in
the
king
's
name
.
<EOS>
You
hear
,
my
lads
,
in
his
majesty
's
name
.
<EOS>
I
command
you
to
assist
me
in
this
highwayman
's
capture
.
<EOS>
Two
hundred
pounds
for
his
head
.
<EOS>
""Two
hundred
devils
!
"
exclaimed
Dick
,
with
a
laugh
of
disdain
.
<EOS>
"
Go
,
seek
your
mother
and
sister
within
yon
vault
,
Major
Mowbray
;
you
will
find
employment
enough
there
.
<EOS>
"Saying
<EOS>
which
,
he
suddenly
forced
Bess
to
back
a
few
yards
;
then
,
striking
his
heels
sharply
into
her
sides
,
ere
his
purpose
could
be
divined
by
the
spectators
,
charged
,
and
cleared
the
lower
part
of
the
mouldering
priory
walls
.
<EOS>
This
feat
was
apparently
accomplished
with
no
great
effort
by
his
admirable
and
unequalled
mare
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
the
powers
!
"
cried
Titus
,
"
and
he
's
given
us
the
slip
after
all
.
<EOS>
And
just
when
we
thought
to
make
sure
of
him
,
too
.
<EOS>
Why
,
Mr.
Coates
,
that
wall
must
be
higher
than
a
five
-
barred
gate
,
or
any
stone
wall
in
my
own
country
.
<EOS>
It
's
just
the
most
extraordinary
lepp
I
ever
set
eyes
<EOS>
on!""The
devil
's
in
the
fellow
,
certainly
,
or
in
his
mare
,
"
returned
Coates
;
"
but
if
he
escapes
me
,
I
'll
forgive
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
whither
he
's
bound
.
<EOS>
He
's
off
to
London
with
my
bill
of
exchange
.
<EOS>
I
'll
be
up
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
'll
track
him
like
a
bloodhound
,
slowly
and
surely
,
as
my
father
,
the
thief
-
taker
,
used
to
follow
up
a
scent
.
<EOS>
Recollect
the
hare
and
the
tortoise
.
<EOS>
The
race
is
not
always
to
the
swift
.
<EOS>
What
say
you
?
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
a
match
for
five
hundred
pounds
;
nay
,
for
five
thousand
:
for
there
is
a
certain
marriage
certificate
in
the
way
—
a
glorious
golden
venture
!
<EOS>
You
shall
go
halves
,
if
we
win
.
<EOS>
We
'll
have
him
,
dead
or
alive
.
<EOS>
What
say
you
for
London
,
Mr.
Tyrconnel
?
<EOS>
Shall
we
start
at
once?""With
all
my
sowl
,
"
replied
Titus
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
with
you
.
"
<EOS>
And
away
this
par
nobile
scoured
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
,
meantime
,
plunged
into
the
vault
.
<EOS>
The
floor
was
slippery
,
and
he
had
nigh
stumbled
.
<EOS>
Loud
and
deep
lamentations
,
and
a
wailing
sound
,
like
that
of
a
lament
for
the
dead
,
resounded
in
his
ears
.
<EOS>
A
light
at
the
further
extremity
of
the
vault
attracted
his
attention
.
<EOS>
He
was
filled
with
terrible
forebodings
;
but
the
worst
reality
was
not
so
terrible
as
suspense
.
<EOS>
He
rushed
towards
the
light
.
<EOS>
He
passed
the
massive
pillars
,
and
there
,
by
the
ruddy
torch
flame
,
discovered
two
female
figures
.
<EOS>
One
was
an
old
woman
,
fantastically
attired
,
wringing
her
hands
,
and
moaning
,
or
gibbering
wild
strains
in
broken
,
discordant
,
yet
pathetic
tones
.
<EOS>
The
other
was
Mrs.
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
Both
were
images
of
despair
.
<EOS>
Before
them
lay
some
motionless
object
.
<EOS>
He
noticed
not
that
old
woman
;
he
scarcely
saw
Mrs.
Mowbray
;
he
beheld
only
that
object
of
horror
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
lifeless
body
of
a
female
.
<EOS>
The
light
fell
imperfectly
upon
the
face
;
he
could
not
discern
the
features
,
but
the
veil
in
which
it
was
swathed
:
that
veil
was
Eleanor
's
!
<EOS>
He
asked
no
more
.
<EOS>
With
a
wild
cry
he
rushed
forward
.
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
,
my
beloved
!
"
shrieked
he
.
<EOS>
Mrs
.
<EOS>
Mowbray
started
at
his
voice
,
but
appeared
stunned
and
helpless
.
<EOS>
"She
is
dead
,
"
said
Ranulph
,
stooping
towards
the
body
.
<EOS>
"
Dead
—
dead!""Ay
,
"
echoed
the
old
woman
,
in
accents
of
equal
anguish—"dead
—
<EOS>
dead!""But
<EOS>
this
is
not
Eleanor
,
"
exclaimed
he
,
as
he
viewed
the
features
more
closely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
face
,
though
beautiful
,
is
not
hers
.
<EOS>
This
dishevelled
hair
is
black
.
<EOS>
The
long
lashes
that
shade
her
cheek
are
of
the
same
hue
.
<EOS>
She
is
scarce
dead
.
<EOS>
The
hand
I
clasp
is
yet
warm
—
the
fingers
are
pliant
.
<EOS>
""Yet
<EOS>
she
is
dead
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
in
a
broken
voice
,
"
she
is
slain
.
<EOS>
""Who
<EOS>
hath
slain
her
?
"
asked
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"I
—
<EOS>
I
—
her
mother
,
slew
her
.
""You
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Ranulph
,
horror
-
stricken
.
"
<EOS>
And
where
is
Eleanor
?
"
asked
he
.
<EOS>
"
Was
she
not
here?""Better
she
were
here
now
,
even
though
she
were
as
that
poor
maid
,
"
groaned
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
"
than
where
she
is
.
<EOS>
""Where
<EOS>
is
she
,
then
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Ranulph
,
with
frantic
eagerness
.
<EOS>
"Fled
.
<EOS>
Whither
<EOS>
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
""With
whom?""With
<EOS>
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
—
with
Alan
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
They
have
borne
her
hence
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
,
you
are
too
late
.
<EOS>
""Gone
!
"
cried
Ranulph
,
fiercely
springing
to
his
feet
.
"
<EOS>
How
escaped
they
?
<EOS>
There
appears
to
be
but
one
entrance
to
this
vault
.
<EOS>
I
will
search
each
nook
and
cranny
.
<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
vain
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
another
outlet
through
yon
cell
.
<EOS>
By
that
passage
they
escaped
.
<EOS>
""Too
<EOS>
true
,
too
true
,
"
shouted
Ranulph
,
who
flew
to
examine
the
cell
.
"
<EOS>
And
wherefore
followed
you
not?""The
stone
rolled
to
its
mouth
,
and
resisted
my
efforts
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
follow
.
<EOS>
""Torture
and
death
!
<EOS>
She
is
lost
to
me
for
ever
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ranulph
,
bitterly
.
"No
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Barbara
,
clutching
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
Place
your
trust
in
me
,
and
I
will
find
her
for
you
.
""You
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"Even
<EOS>
I
,
"
replied
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"
Your
wrongs
shall
be
righted
—

Sybil

<EOS>
IllustrationTHE
<EOS>
present
straggling
suburb
at
the
north
-
west
of
the
metropolis
,
known
as
Kilburn
,
had
scarcely
been
called
into
existence
a
century
ago
,
and
an
ancient
hostel
,
with
a
few
detached
farmhouses
,
were
the
sole
habitations
to
be
found
in
the
present
populous
vicinage
.
<EOS>
The
place
of
refreshment
for
the
ruralizing
cockney
of
1737
was
a
substantial
-
looking
tenement
of
the
good
old
stamp
,
with
great
bay
windows
,
and
a
balcony
in
front
,
bearing
as
its
ensign
the
jovial
visage
of
the
lusty
knight
,
Jack
Falstaff
.
<EOS>
Shaded
by
a
spreading
elm
,
a
circular
bench
embraced
the
aged
trunk
of
the
tree
,
sufficiently
tempting
,
no
doubt
,
to
incline
the
wanderer
on
those
dusty
ways
to
"
rest
and
be
thankful
,
"
and
to
cry
encore
to
a
frothing
tankard
of
the
best
ale
to
be
obtained
within
the
chimes
of
Bow
bells
.
<EOS>
Upon
a
table
,
green
as
the
privet
and
holly
that
formed
the
walls
of
the
bower
in
which
it
was
placed
,
stood
a
great
china
bowl
,
one
of
those
leviathan
memorials
of
bygone
wassailry
which
we
may
sometimes
espy
—
reversed
in
token
of
its
desuetude
—
perched
on
the
top
of
an
old
japanned
closet
,
but
seldom
,
if
ever
,
encountered
in
its
proper
position
at
the
genial
board
.
<EOS>
All
the
appliances
of
festivity
were
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Pipes
and
rummers
strewed
the
board
.
<EOS>
Perfume
,
subtle
,
yet
mellow
,
as
of
pine
and
lime
,
exhaled
from
out
the
bowl
,
and
,
mingling
with
the
scent
of
a
neighboring
bed
of
mignonette
and
the
subdued
odor
of
the
Indian
weed
,
formed
altogether
as
delectable
an
atmosphere
of
sweets
as
one
could
wish
to
inhale
on
a
melting
August
afternoon
.
<EOS>
So
,
at
least
,
thought
the
inmates
of
the
arbor
;
nor
did
they
by
any
means
confine
themselves
to
the
gratification
of
a
single
sense
.
<EOS>
The
ambrosial
contents
of
the
china
bowl
proved
as
delicious
to
the
taste
as
its
bouquet
was
grateful
to
the
smell
;
while
the
eyesight
was
soothed
by
reposing
on
the
smooth
sward
of
a
bowling
-
green
spread
out
immediately
before
it
,
or
in
dwelling
upon
gently
undulating
meads
,
terminating
,
at
about
a
mile
's
distance
,
in
the
woody
,
spire
-
crowned
heights
of
Hampstead
.
<EOS>
At
the
left
of
the
table
was
seated
,
or
rather
lounged
,
a
slender
,
elegant
-
looking
young
man
,
with
dark
,
languid
eyes
,
sallow
complexion
,
and
features
wearing
that
peculiarly
pensive
expression
often
communicated
by
dissipation
;
an
expression
which
,
we
regret
to
say
,
is
sometimes
found
more
pleasing
than
it
ought
to
be
in
the
eyes
of
the
gentle
sex
.
<EOS>
Habited
in
a
light
summer
riding
-
dress
,
fashioned
according
to
the
taste
of
the
time
,
of
plain
and
unpretending
material
,
and
rather
under
than
overdressed
,
he
had
,
perhaps
,
on
that
very
account
,
perfectly
the
air
of
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
altogether
,
an
absence
of
pretension
about
him
,
which
,
combined
with
great
apparent
self
-
possession
,
contrasted
very
forcibly
with
the
vulgar
assurance
of
his
showy
companions
.
<EOS>
The
figure
of
the
youth
was
slight
,
even
to
fragility
,
giving
little
outward
manifestation
of
the
vigor
of
frame
he
in
reality
possessed
.
<EOS>
This
spark
was
a
no
less
distinguished
personage
than
Tom
King
,
a
noted
high
-
tobygloak
of
his
time
,
who
obtained
,
from
his
appearance
and
address
,
the
sobriquet
of
the
"
Gentleman
Highwayman
.
<EOS>
"Tom
was
indeed
a
pleasant
fellow
in
his
day
.
<EOS>
His
career
was
brief
,
but
brilliant
:
your
meteors
are
ever
momentary
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
younger
son
of
a
good
family
;
had
good
blood
in
his
veins
,
though
not
a
groat
in
his
pockets
.
<EOS>
According
to
the
old
song
—
When
he
arrived
at
man
's
estate
,
It
was
all
the
estate
<EOS>
he
had;and
all
the
estate
he
was
ever
likely
to
have
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
if
he
had
no
income
,
he
contrived
,
as
he
said
,
to
live
as
if
he
had
the
mines
of
Peru
at
his
control
—
a
miracle
not
solely
confined
to
himself
.
<EOS>
For
a
moneyless
man
,
he
had
rather
expensive
habits
.
<EOS>
He
kept
his
three
nags
;
and
,
if
fame
does
not
belie
him
,
a
like
number
of
mistresses
;
nay
,
if
we
are
to
place
any
faith
in
certain
scandalous
chronicles
to
which
we
have
had
access
,
he
was
for
some
time
the
favored
lover
of
a
celebrated
actress
,
who
,
for
the
time
,
supplied
him
with
the
means
of
keeping
up
his
showy
establishment
.
<EOS>
But
things
could
not
long
hold
thus
.
<EOS>
Tom
was
a
model
of
infidelity
,
and
that
was
the
only
failing
his
mistress
could
not
overlook
.
<EOS>
She
dismissed
him
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
<EOS>
Unluckily
,
too
,
he
had
other
propensities
which
contributed
to
involve
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
taste
for
the
turf
—
a
taste
for
play
—
was
well
known
in
the
hundreds
of
Drury
,
and
cut
no
mean
figure
at
Howell
's
,
and
the
faro
tables
there
-
anent
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
glory
of
the
Smyrna
,
D'Osyndar
's
,
and
other
chocolate
houses
of
the
day
;
and
it
was
at
this
time
he
fell
into
the
hands
of
certain
dexterous
sharpers
,
by
whom
he
was
at
first
plucked
and
subsequently
patronized
.
<EOS>
Under
their
tuition
he
improved
wonderfully
.
<EOS>
He
turned
his
wit
and
talent
to
some
account
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
open
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
His
nine
days
'
blindness
was
over
.
<EOS>
The
dog
saw
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
spite
of
his
quickness
,
he
was
at
length
discovered
,
and
ejected
from
Howell
's
in
a
manner
that
left
him
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
He
must
either
have
called
out
his
adversary
,
or
have
gone
out
himself
.
<EOS>
He
preferred
the
latter
,
and
took
to
the
road
;
and
in
his
new
line
he
was
eminently
successful
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
he
had
no
scruples
to
get
over
.
<EOS>
Tom
had
what
Sir
Walter
Scott
happily
denominates
"
an
indistinct
notion
of
meum
and
tuum
,
"
and
became
confirmed
in
the
opinion
that
everything
he
could
lay
hands
upon
constituted
lawful
spoil
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
even
those
he
robbed
,
admitted
that
he
was
the
most
gentlemanlike
highwayman
they
had
ever
the
fortune
to
meet
with
,
and
trusted
they
might
always
be
so
lucky
.
<EOS>
So
popular
did
he
become
upon
the
road
,
that
it
was
accounted
a
distinction
to
be
stopped
by
him
;
he
made
a
point
of
robbing
none
but
gentlemen
,
and
—
Tom
's
shade
would
quarrel
with
us
were
we
to
omit
them
—
ladies
.
<EOS>
His
acquaintance
with
Turpin
was
singular
,
and
originated
in
a
rencontre
.
<EOS>
Struck
with
his
appearance
,
Dick
presented
a
pistol
,
and
bade
King
deliver
.
<EOS>
The
latter
burst
into
a
laugh
,
and
an
explanation
immediately
ensued
.
<EOS>
Thenceforward
they
became
sworn
brothers
—
the
Pylades
and
Orestes
of
the
road
;
and
though
seldom
seen
together
in
public
,
had
many
a
merry
moonlight
ride
in
company
.
<EOS>
Tom
still
maintained
three
mistresses
,
his
valet
,
his
groom
—
tiger
,
we
should
have
called
him,—"and
many
a
change
of
clothes
besides
,
"
says
his
biographer
,
"
with
which
he
appeared
more
like
a
lord
than
a
highwayman
.
<EOS>
"
And
what
more
,
we
should
like
to
know
,
would
a
lord
wish
to
have
?
<EOS>
Few
younger
sons
,
we
believe
,
can
boast
so
much
;
and
it
is
chiefly
on
their
account
,
with
some
remote
view
to
the
benefit
of
the
unemployed
youth
of
all
professions
,
that
we
have
enlarged
so
much
upon
Tom
King
's
history
.
<EOS>
The
road
,
we
must
beg
to
repeat
,
is
still
open
;
the
chances
are
greater
than
they
ever
were
;
we
fully
believe
it
is
their
only
road
to
preferment
,
and
we
are
sadly
in
want
of
highwaymen!Fancy
Tom
lounging
at
D'Osyndar
's
,
carelessly
tapping
his
boots
on
the
steps
;
there
he
stands
!
<EOS>
Is
he
not
a
devilish
good
-
looking
,
gentlemanlike
sort
of
fellow
?
<EOS>
You
could
never
have
taken
him
for
a
highwayman
but
for
our
information
.
<EOS>
A
waiter
appears
—
supper
is
ordered
at
twelve
—
a
broiled
chicken
and
a
bottle
of
Burgundy
—
his
groom
brings
his
nags
to
the
door
—
he
mounts
.
<EOS>
It
is
his
custom
to
ride
out
on
an
evening
—
he
is
less
liable
to
interruption.[93
]
<EOS>
At
Marylebone
Fields
—
now
the
Regent
's
Park,—his
groom
leaves
him
.
<EOS>
He
has
a
mistress
in
the
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
He
is
absent
for
a
couple
of
hours
,
and
returns
gay
or
dispirited
,
as
his
luck
may
have
turned
out
.
<EOS>
At
twelve
he
is
at
supper
,
and
has
the
night
before
him
.
<EOS>
How
very
easy
all
this
seems
.
<EOS>
Can
it
be
possible
<EOS>
we
have
no
Tom
Kings?To
return
to
Tom
as
he
was
in
the
arbor
.
<EOS>
Judging
from
his
manner
,
he
appeared
to
be
almost
insensible
to
the
presence
of
his
companions
,
and
to
be
scarcely
a
partaker
in
their
revelry
.
<EOS>
His
back
was
towards
his
immediate
neighbor
;
his
glass
sparkled
untouched
at
his
elbow
;
and
one
hand
,
beautifully
white
and
small
,
a
mark
of
his
birth
and
breeding
—
crede
Byron
—
rested
upon
the
edge
of
the
table
,
while
his
thin
,
delicate
digits
,
palpably
demonstrative
of
his
faculty
of
adaptation
—
crede
James
Hardy
Vaux
—
were
employed
with
a
silver
toothpick
.
<EOS>
In
other
respects
,
he
seemed
to
be
lost
in
reverie
,
and
was
,
in
all
probability
,
meditating
new
exploits
.
<EOS>
Next
to
King
sat
our
old
friend
Jerry
Juniper
;
not
,
however
,
the
Jerry
of
the
gipsies
,
but
a
much
more
showy
-
looking
personage
.
<EOS>
Jerry
was
no
longer
a
gentleman
of
"
three
outs"—the
difficulty
would
now
have
been
to
say
what
he
was
"
without
.
"
<EOS>
Snakelike
he
had
cast
his
slough
,
and
rejoiced
in
new
and
brilliant
investiture
.
<EOS>
His
were
"
speaking
garments
,
speaking
pockets
too
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
linen
was
of
the
finest
,
his
hose
of
the
smartest
.
<EOS>
Gay
rings
glittered
on
his
fingers
;
a
crystal
snuff
-
box
underwent
graceful
manipulation
;
a
handsome
gold
repeater
was
sometimes
drawn
from
its
location
with
a
monstrous
bunch
of
onions
—
anglicè
,
seals
—
depending
from
its
massive
chain
.
<EOS>
Lace
adorned
his
wrists
,
and
shoes
—
of
which
they
had
been
long
unconscious,—with
buckles
nearly
as
large
as
themselves
,
confined
his
feet
.
<EOS>
A
rich
-
powdered
peruke
and
silver
-
hilted
sword
completed
the
gear
of
the
transmogrified
Jerry
,
or
,
as
he
now
chose
to
be
designated
,
Count
Albert
Conyers
.
<EOS>
The
fact
was
,
that
Jerry
,
after
the
fracas
,
apprehensive
that
the
country
would
be
too
hot
for
him
,
had
,
in
company
with
Zoroaster
,
quitted
the
ranks
of
the
Canting
Crew
,
and
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
town
.
<EOS>
A
lucky
spice
on
the
road
set
them
up
;
and
having
some
acquaintance
with
Tom
King
,
the
party
,
on
their
arrival
,
sought
him
out
at
his
customary
haunt
,
D'Osyndar
's
,
and
enlisted
under
his
banners
.
<EOS>
Tom
received
them
with
open
arms
,
gave
them
unlimited
use
of
his
wardrobe
,
and
only
required
a
little
trifling
assistance
in
return
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
grand
scheme
in
petto
,
in
the
execution
of
which
they
could
mainly
assist
him
.
<EOS>
Jerry
was
a
Greek
by
nature
,
and
could
land
a
flat
as
well
as
the
best
of
them
.
<EOS>
Zoroaster
was
just
the
man
to
lose
a
fight
;
or
,
in
the
language
of
the
Fancy
,
to
play
a
cross
.
<EOS>
No
two
legs
could
serve
Tom
's
purposes
better
.
<EOS>
He
welcomed
them
with
fraternal
affection
.
<EOS>
We
will
now
proceed
to
reconnoitre
Jerry
's
opposite
neighbor
,
who
was
,
however
,
no
other
than
that
Upright
Man
,
The
Magus
Zoroaster
,
that
great
name
.
<EOS>
Changed
as
was
Juniper
,
the
Magus
was
yet
more
whimsically
metamorphosed
.
<EOS>
Some
traces
of
Jerry
still
remained
,
but
not
a
vestige
was
left
of
the
original
Dimber
Damber
.
<EOS>
His
tawny
mother
had
not
known
her
son
.
<EOS>
This
alteration
,
however
,
was
not
owing
to
change
of
dress
;
it
was
the
result
of
the
punishment
he
had
received
at
the
"
set
-
to
"
at
the
priory
.
<EOS>
Not
a
feature
was
in
its
place
;
his
swollen
lip
trespassed
upon
the
precincts
of
his
nose
;
his
nose
trod
hard
upon
his
cheek
;
while
his
cheek
again
,
not
to
be
behind
the
rest
,
rose
up
like
an
apple
-
dumpling
under
his
single
eye,—single
,
we
say
—
for
,
alas
!
<EOS>
there
was
no
speculation
in
the
other
.
<EOS>
His
dexter
daylight
was
utterly
darkened
,
and
,
indeed
,
the
orb
that
remained
was
as
sanguinary
a
luminary
as
ever
struggled
through
a
London
fog
at
noonday
.
<EOS>
To
borrow
a
couplet
or
so
from
the
laureate
of
the
Fancy:——One
of
his
peepers
was
putOn
the
bankruptcy
list
,
with
his
shop
windows
shut
,
While
the
other
made
nearly
as
tag
-
rag
<EOS>
a
show
,
All
rimmed
round
with
black
like
the
Courier
in
woe
.
<EOS>
One
black
patch
decorated
his
rainbow
-
colored
cheek
;
another
adorned
his
chin
;
a
grinder
having
been
dislodged
,
his
pipe
took
possession
of
the
aperture
.
<EOS>
His
toggery
was
that
of
a
member
of
the
prize
-
ring
;
what
we
now
call
a
"
belcher
"
bound
his
throat
;
a
spotted
fogle
bandaged
his
jobbernowl
,
and
shaded
his
right
peeper
,
while
a
white
beaver
crowned
the
occiput
of
the
Magus
.
<EOS>
And
though
,
at
first
sight
,
there
would
appear
to
be
some
incongruity
in
the
association
of
such
a
battered
character
as
the
Upright
Man
with
his
smart
companions
,
the
reader
's
wonder
will
rapidly
diminish
,
when
he
reflects
that
any
distinguished
P.
C.
man
can
ever
find
a
ready
passport
to
the
most
exclusive
society
.
<EOS>
Viewed
in
this
light
,
Zoroaster
's
familiarity
with
his
swell
acquaintance
occasioned
no
surprise
to
old
Simon
Carr
,
the
bottle
-
nosed
landlord
of
the
Falstaff
,
who
was
a
man
of
discernment
in
his
way
,
and
knew
a
thing
or
two
.
<EOS>
Despite
such
striking
evidences
to
the
contrary
,
the
Magus
was
perfectly
at
his
ease
,
and
sacrificing
as
usual
to
the
god
of
flame
.
<EOS>
His
mithra
,
or
pipe
,
the
symbol
of
his
faith
,
was
zealously
placed
between
his
lips
,
and
never
did
his
Chaldean
,
Bactrian
,
Persian
,
Pamphylian
,
Proconnesian
,
or
Babylonian
namesake
<EOS>
,
whichever
of
the
six
was
the
true
Zoroaster
—
videBayle,—respire
more
fervently
at
the
altar
of
fire
,
than
our
Magus
at
the
end
of
his
enkindled
tube
.
<EOS>
In
his
creed
we
believe
Zoroaster
was
a
dualist
,
and
believed
in
the
co
-
existence
and
mystical
relation
of
the
principles
of
good
and
ill
;
his
pipe
being
his
Yezdan
,
or
benign
influence
;
his
empty
pouch
his
Ahreman
,
or
the
devil
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
pause
to
examine
his
tenets
;
we
meddle
with
no
man
's
religious
opinions
,
and
shall
leave
the
Magus
to
the
enjoyment
of
his
own
sentiments
,
be
they
what
they
may
.
<EOS>
One
guest
alone
remains
,
and
him
we
shall
briefly
dismiss
.
<EOS>
The
reader
,
we
imagine
,
will
scarcely
need
to
be
told
who
was
the
owner
of
those
keen
gray
eyes
;
those
exuberant
red
whiskers
;
that
airy
azure
frock
.
<EOS>
It
wasOur
brave
co
-
partner
of
the
roads
.
<EOS>
Skilful
surveyor
of
highways
and
hedges;in
<EOS>
a
word
—
Dick
Turpin!Dick
had
been
called
upon
to
act
as
president
of
the
board
,
and
an
excellent
president
he
made
,
sedulously
devoting
himself
to
the
due
administration
of
the
punch
-
bowl
.
<EOS>
Not
a
rummer
was
allowed
to
stand
empty
for
an
instant
.
<EOS>
Toast
,
sentiment
,
and
anacreontic
song
,
succeeded
each
other
at
speedy
intervals
;
but
there
was
no
speechifying
—
no
politics
.
<EOS>
He
left
church
and
state
to
take
care
of
themselves
.
<EOS>
Whatever
his
politics
might
be
,
Dick
never
allowed
them
to
interfere
with
his
pleasures
.
<EOS>
His
maxim
was
to
make
the
most
of
the
passing
moment
;
the
dum
vivimus
vivamus
was
never
out
of
his
mind
;
a
precautionary
measure
which
we
recommend
to
the
adoption
of
all
gentlemen
of
the
like
,
or
any
other
precarious
profession
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
Dick
's
efforts
to
promote
conviviality
,
seconded
by
the
excellence
of
the
beverage
itself
,
conversation
,
somehow
or
other
,
began
to
flag
;
from
being
general
it
became
particular
.
<EOS>
Tom
King
,
who
was
no
punch
-
bibber
,
especially
at
that
time
of
day
,
fell
into
a
deep
reverie
;
your
gamesters
often
do
so
;
while
the
Magus
,
who
had
smoked
himself
drowsy
,
was
composing
himself
to
a
doze
.
<EOS>
Turpin
seized
this
opportunity
of
addressing
a
few
words
on
matters
of
business
to
Jerry
Juniper
,
or
,
as
he
now
chose
to
be
called
,
Count
Conyers
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
dear
count
,
"
said
Dick
,
in
a
low
and
confidential
tone
,
"
you
are
aware
that
my
errand
to
town
is
accomplished
.
<EOS>
I
have
smashed
Lawyer
Coates
's
screen
,
pocketed
the
dimmock
—
here
'
tis
,
"
continued
he
,
parenthetically
,
slapping
his
pockets,—"and
done
t'other
trick
in
prime
twig
for
Tom
King
.
<EOS>
With
a
cool
thousand
in
hand
,
I
might
,
if
I
chose
,
rest
awhile
on
my
oars
.
<EOS>
But
a
quiet
life
do
n't
suit
me
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
moving
.
<EOS>
So
I
shall
start
to
Yorkshire
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
!
"
said
the
soi
-
disant
count
,
in
a
languid
tone—"so
soon?""I
have
nothing
to
detain
me
,
"
replied
Dick
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
want
to
see
how
matters
stand
with
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
sorry
if
he
went
to
the
wall
for
want
of
any
assistance
<EOS>
I
can
render
him
.
<EOS>
""True
<EOS>
,
"
returned
the
count
;
"
one
would
regret
such
an
occurrence
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
But
I
fear
your
assistance
may
arrive
a
little
too
late
.
<EOS>
He
is
pretty
well
done
up
,
I
should
imagine
,
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
""That
remains
to
be
seen
,
"
said
Turpin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
case
is
a
bad
one
,
to
be
sure
,
but
I
trust
not
utterly
hopeless
.
<EOS>
With
all
his
impetuosity
and
pride
,
I
like
the
fellow
,
and
will
help
him
,
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
difficult
game
to
set
him
on
his
legs
,
but
I
think
it
may
be
done
.
<EOS>
That
underground
marriage
was
sheer
madness
,
and
turned
out
as
ill
as
such
a
scheme
might
have
been
expected
to
do
.
<EOS>
Poor
Sybil
!
<EOS>
if
I
could
pipe
an
eye
for
anything
,
it
should
be
for
her
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
get
her
out
of
my
head
.
<EOS>
Give
me
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
<EOS>
Such
thoughts
unman
one
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
priest
,
that
's
a
totally
different
affair
.
<EOS>
If
he
strangled
his
daughter
,
old
Alan
did
right
to
take
the
law
into
his
own
hands
,
and
throttle
him
in
return
.
<EOS>
I
'd
have
done
the
same
thing
myself
;
and
,
being
a
proscribed
Jesuit
,
returned
,
as
I
understand
,
without
the
king
's
license
for
so
doing
,
why
Father
Checkley
's
murder
—
if
it
must
be
so
called
,
I
ca
n't
abide
hard
terms
—
won't
lie
very
heavy
at
Alan
's
door
.
<EOS>
That
,
however
,
has
nothing
to
do
with
Sir
Luke
.
<EOS>
He
was
neither
accessory
nor
principal
.
<EOS>
Still
he
will
be
in
danger
,
at
least
from
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
The
whole
county
of
York
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
is
up
in
arms
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
why
go
thither
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
count
,
somewhat
ironically
;
"
for
my
part
,
I
've
a
strange
fancy
for
keeping
out
of
harm
's
way
as
long
as
possible
.
<EOS>
""Every
man
to
his
taste
<EOS>
,
"
returned
Turpin
;
"
I
love
to
confront
danger
.
<EOS>
Run
away
!
<EOS>
pshaw
!
<EOS>
always
meet
your
foe
.
<EOS>
""True
,
"
replied
the
count
,
"
half
-
way
!
<EOS>
but
you
go
the
whole
distance
.
<EOS>
What
prudent
man
would
beard
the
lion
in
his
den?""I
never
was
a
prudent
man
,
"
rejoined
Dick
,
smiling
;
"
I
have
no
superfluous
caution
about
me
.
<EOS>
Come
what
will
,
I
shall
try
to
find
out
this
Luke
Rookwood
,
and
offer
him
my
purse
,
such
as
it
is
,
and
it
is
now
better
lined
than
usual
;
a
hand
free
to
act
as
he
lists
;
and
a
head
which
,
imprudent
though
it
be
,
can
often
think
better
for
others
than
for
its
own
master
.
<EOS>
""Vastly
fine
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
count
,
with
an
ill
-
disguised
sneer
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
do
n't
forget
that
the
marriage
certificate
which
you
hold
is
perfectly
valueless
now
.
<EOS>
The
estates
,
you
are
aware——""Are
no
longer
Sir
Luke
's
.
<EOS>
I
see
what
you
are
driving
at
,
count
,
"
returned
Dick
,
coldly
.
"
<EOS>
But
he
will
need
it
to
establish
his
claim
to
the
title
,
and
he
shall
have
it
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
Sir
Luke
,
with
ten
thousand
a
year
,
I
drove
a
hard
bargain
,
and
would
have
stood
out
for
the
last
stiver
.
<EOS>
Now
that
he
is
one
of
'
us
'
,
a
mere
Knight
of
the
Road
,
he
shall
have
it
and
welcome
.
<EOS>
""Perhaps
<EOS>
Lady
Rookwood
,
or
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
might
be
inclined
to
treat
,
"
maliciously
insinuated
the
count
;
"
the
title
may
be
worth
something
to
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
""It
is
worth
more
to
Luke
;
and
if
it
were
not
,
he
gets
it
.
<EOS>
Are
you
satisfied?""Perfectly
,
"
replied
the
count
,
with
affected
bonhomie
;
"
and
I
will
now
let
you
into
a
secret
respecting
Miss
Mowbray
,
from
which
you
may
gather
something
for
your
guidance
in
this
matter
;
and
if
the
word
of
a
woman
is
at
all
to
be
trusted
,
though
individually
I
can
not
say
I
have
much
faith
in
it
,
Sir
Luke
's
planetary
hour
is
not
yet
completely
overcast
.
<EOS>
""That
's
exactly
what
I
wish
to
know
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
said
Turpin
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
already
told
me
you
were
witness
to
a
singular
interview
between
Miss
Mowbray
and
Sir
Luke
after
my
departure
from
the
priory
.
<EOS>
If
I
mistook
you
not
,
the
whole
business
will
hinge
upon
that
.
<EOS>
What
occurred
?
<EOS>
Let
me
have
every
particular
.
<EOS>
The
whole
history
and
mystery
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
shall
have
it
with
pleasure
,
"
said
the
count
;
"
and
I
hope
it
may
tend
to
your
benefit
.
<EOS>
After
I
had
quitted
the
scene
of
action
at
the
priory
,
and
at
your
desire
left
the
Rookwood
party
masters
of
the
field
,
I
fled
with
the
rest
of
the
crew
towards
the
rocks
.
<EOS>
There
we
held
a
council
of
war
for
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
Some
were
for
returning
to
the
fight
;
but
this
was
negatived
entirely
,
and
in
the
end
it
was
agreed
that
those
who
had
wives
,
daughters
,
and
sisters
,
should
join
them
as
speedily
as
possible
at
their
retreat
in
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
As
I
happened
to
have
none
of
these
attractive
ties
,
and
had
only
a
troublesome
mistress
,
who
I
thought
could
take
care
of
herself
,
I
did
not
care
to
follow
them
,
but
struck
deeper
into
the
wood
,
and
made
my
way
,
guided
by
destiny
,
I
suppose
,
towards
the
cave
.
<EOS>
""The
cave
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dick
,
rubbing
his
hands
<EOS>
;
"
I
delight
in
a
cave
.
<EOS>
Tom
King
and
I
once
had
a
cave
of
our
own
at
Epping
,
and
I
'll
have
another
one
of
these
fine
days
.
<EOS>
A
cave
is
as
proper
to
a
high
-
tobyman
as
a
castle
to
a
baron
.
<EOS>
Pray
go
on
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
cave
<EOS>
I
speak
of
<EOS>
,
"
continued
the
count
,
"
was
seldom
used
,
except
upon
great
emergencies
,
by
any
of
the
Stop
Hole
Abbey
crew
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
sort
of
retiring
den
of
our
old
lioness
Barbara
,
and
,
like
all
belonging
to
her
,
respected
by
her
dupes
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
cave
is
a
good
cave
for
all
that
;
is
well
concealed
by
brushwood
,
and
comfortably
lighted
from
a
crevice
in
the
rock
above
;
it
lies
near
the
brink
of
the
stream
,
amongst
the
woods
just
above
the
waterfall
,
and
is
somewhat
difficult
of
approach
.
<EOS>
""I
know
something
of
the
situation
,
"
said
Turpin
.
<EOS>
"Well
<EOS>
,
"
returned
the
count
,
"
not
to
lose
time
,
into
this
den
I
crept
,
and
,
expecting
to
find
it
vacant
,
you
may
imagine
my
surprise
on
discovering
that
it
was
already
occupied
,
and
that
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
,
his
granddad
,
old
Alan
,
Miss
Mowbray
,
and
,
worst
of
all
,
the
very
person
I
wished
most
to
avoid
,
my
old
flame
Handassah
,
constituted
the
party
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
they
did
not
perceive
my
entrance
,
and
I
took
especial
care
not
to
introduce
myself
.
<EOS>
Retreat
,
however
,
was
for
the
moment
impracticable
,
and
I
was
compelled
to
be
a
listener
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
what
had
passed
between
the
parties
before
my
arrival
,
but
I
heard
Miss
Mowbray
implore
Sir
Luke
to
conduct
her
to
her
mother
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
half
inclined
to
comply
with
her
entreaties
;
but
old
Alan
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
Handassah
put
in
a
word
;
the
minx
was
ever
ready
at
that
.
'
<EOS>
Fear
not
,
'
said
she
,
'
<EOS>
that
she
will
we
d
Sir
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
Deliver
her
to
her
friends
,
I
beseech
you
,
Sir
Luke
,
and
woo
her
honorably
.
<EOS>
She
will
accept
you
.
'
<EOS>
Sir
Luke
stared
incredulously
,
and
grim
old
Alan
smiled
.
'
<EOS>
She
has
sworn
to
be
yours
,
'
continued
Handassah
;
'
sworn
it
by
every
hope
of
heaven
,
and
the
oath
has
been
sealed
by
blood
—
by
Sybil
's
blood
.
<EOS>
'—'Does
<EOS>
she
speak
the
truth
?
'
<EOS>
asked
Sir
Luke
,
trembling
with
agitation
.
<EOS>
Miss
Mowbray
answered
not
.
'
<EOS>
You
will
not
deny
it
,
lady
,
'
said
Handassah
.
'
<EOS>
I
heard
that
oath
proposed
.
<EOS>
I
saw
it
registered
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
deny
it
.
<EOS>
'—'I
<EOS>
do
not
,
'
replied
Miss
Mowbray
,
with
much
anguish
of
manner
;
'
if
he
claim
me
,
I
am
his
.
<EOS>
'—'And
<EOS>
he
will
claim
you
,
'
said
Alan
Rookwood
,
triumphantly
.
'
<EOS>
He
has
your
oath
,
no
matter
how
extorted
—
you
must
fulfil
your
vow
.
<EOS>
'—'I
am
prepared
to
do
so
,
'
said
Eleanor
.
'
<EOS>
But
if
you
would
not
utterly
destroy
me
,
let
this
maid
conduct
me
to
my
mother
,
to
my
friends
.
<EOS>
'—'To
Ranulph
?
'
<EOS>
asked
Sir
Luke
,
bitterly.—'No
,
<EOS>
no
,
'
returned
Miss
Mowbray
,
in
accents
of
deepest
despair
,
'
to
my
mother
—
I
wish
not
to
behold
him
again
.
<EOS>
'—'Be
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
so
,
'
cried
Sir
Luke
;
'
but
remember
,
in
love
or
hate
,
you
are
mine
;
I
shall
claim
the
fulfilment
of
your
oath
.
<EOS>
Farewell
.
<EOS>
Handassah
will
lead
you
to
your
mother
.
'
<EOS>
Miss
Mowbray
bowed
her
head
,
but
returned
no
answer
,
while
,
followed
by
old
Alan
,
Sir
Luke
departed
from
the
cavern
.
<EOS>
""Whither
went
they
?
"
demanded
Turpin
.
<EOS>
"That
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
"
replied
Jerry
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
about
to
follow
,
when
I
was
prevented
by
the
abrupt
entrance
of
another
party
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
,
I
think
,
could
the
two
Rookwoods
have
made
good
their
retreat
,
when
shouts
were
heard
without
,
and
young
Ranulph
and
Major
Mowbray
forced
their
way
,
sword
in
hand
,
into
the
cave
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
situation
—
for
me
,
I
mean
—
to
the
young
lady
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
it
was
pleasant
enough
.
<EOS>
But
my
neck
was
in
jeopardy
.
<EOS>
However
,
you
know
I
am
not
deficient
in
strength
,
and
,
upon
the
present
occasion
,
I
made
the
best
use
of
the
agility
with
which
nature
has
endowed
me
.
<EOS>
Amidst
the
joyous
confusion
—
the
sobbings
,
and
embracings
,
and
congratulations
that
ensued
—
I
contrived
,
like
a
wild
cat
,
to
climb
the
rocky
sides
of
the
cave
,
and
concealed
myself
behind
a
jutting
fragment
of
stone
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
<EOS>
I
did
so
,
<EOS>
for
scarcely
was
I
hidden
,
when
in
came
old
Barbara
,
followed
by
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
and
a
dozen
others
.
<EOS>
""Barbara
<EOS>
!
"
ejaculated
Dick
.
"
Was
she
a
prisoner?""No
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Jerry
;
"
the
old
hell
-
cat
is
too
deep
for
that
.
<EOS>
She
had
betrayed
Sir
Luke
,
and
hoped
they
would
seize
him
and
his
granddad
.
<EOS>
But
the
birds
were
flown
.
<EOS>
""I'm
<EOS>
glad
she
was
baulked
,
"
said
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Was
any
search
made
after
them?""Can't
say
,
"
replied
Jerry
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
only
indistinctly
catch
the
sounds
of
their
voices
from
my
lofty
retreat
.
<EOS>
Before
they
left
the
cavern
,
I
made
out
that
Mrs.
Mowbray
resolved
to
go
to
Rookwood
,
and
to
take
her
daughter
thither
—
a
proceeding
to
which
the
latter
demurred
.
<EOS>
""To
Rookwood
,
"
said
Dick
,
musingly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Will
she
keep
her
oath
,
I
wonder?""That
's
more
than
I
can
say
,
"
said
Jerry
,
sipping
his
punch
.
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
deceitful
sex!""'Tis
a
deceitful
sex
,
indeed
,
"

"PEACE
,
<EOS>
base
calumniators
,
"
exclaimed
Tom
King
,
aroused
from
his
toothpick
reverie
by
these
aspersions
of
the
best
part
of
creation
.
<EOS>
"
Peace
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
None
shall
dare
abuse
that
dear
devoted
sex
in
the
hearing
of
their
champion
,
without
pricking
a
lance
with
him
in
their
behalf
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
,
either
of
you
,
who
abuse
woman
in
that
wholesale
style
,
know
of
her
?
<EOS>
Nothing
—
less
than
nothing
;
and
yet
you
venture
,
upon
your
paltry
experience
,
to
lift
up
your
voices
and
decry
the
sex
.
<EOS>
Now
I
do
know
her
;
and
upon
my
own
experience
avouch
,
that
,
as
a
sex
,
woman
,
compared
with
man
,
is
as
an
angel
to
a
devil

<EOS>
As

Saying
which
,
in
a
mellow
,
plaintive
tone
,
Tom
gave
the
following
:
PLEDGE
OF
THE
HIGHWAYMANCome
,
fill
up
a
bumper
to
Eve
's
fairest
daughters
,
Who
have
lavished
their
smiles
on
the
brave
and
the
free;Toast
the
sweethearts
of
Dudley
,
Hind
,
Wilmot
,
and
Waters,[94]Whate'er
their
attraction
,
whate'er
their

.
<EOS>
Pledge
!
<EOS>
pledge
in
a
bumper
,
each
kind
-
hearted
maiden
,
Whose
bright
eyes
were
dimmed
at
the
highwayman
's
fall;Who
stood
by
the
gallows
with
sorrow
o'erladen
,
Bemoaning
the
fate
of
the
gallant
Du
-
Val!Here
<EOS>
's
to
each
lovely
lass
chance
of
war
bringeth
near
one
,
Whom
,
with
manner
impassioned
,
we
tenderly
stop;And
to
whom
,
like
the
lover
addressing
his
dear
one
,
In
terms
of
entreaty
the
question
we
pop
.
<EOS>
How
oft
,
in
such
case
,
rosy
lips
have
proved
sweeterThan
the
rosiest
book
,
bright
eyes
saved
a
bright
ring;While
that
one
other
kiss
has
brought
off
a
repeater
,
And
a
bead
as
a
favor
—
the
favorite
string
.
<EOS>
With
our
hearts
ready
rifled
,
each
pocket
we
rifle
,
With
the
pure
flame
of
chivalry
stirring
our
breasts;Life
's
risk
for
our
mistress
's
praise
is
a
trifle;And
each
purse
as
a
trophy
our
homage
attests
.
<EOS>
Then
toss
off
your
glasses
to
all
girls
of
spirit
,
Ne'er
with
names
,
or
with
number
,
your
memories
vex;Our
toast
,
boys
,
embraces
each
woman
of
merit
,
And
,
for
fear
of
omission
,
we
'll
drink
the
whole
sex
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
"
replied
Dick
,
replenishing
King
's
rummer
,
while
he
laughed
heartily
at
his
ditty
,
"
I
sha
n't
refuse
your
toast
,
though
my
heart
do
n't
respond
to
your
sentiments

<EOS>
Ah
,
Tom
!
<EOS>
the
sex
you
praise
so
much
will
,
I
fear
,
prove
your
undoing

<EOS>
Do
as
you
please
,
but
curse
me
if
ever
I
pin
my
life
to
a
petticoat
.
<EOS>
I
'd
as
soon
think
of
neglecting
the
four
cautions
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
four
cautions
,
"
said
King
;
"
what
are
they?""Did
you
never
hear
them
?
<EOS>
"
replied
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Attend
,
then
,
and
be
edified
.
"THE
FOUR

,
"
all

<EOS>
Not

I
from

<EOS>
She
could
have
sold

over

if

chosen

is
not

<EOS>
""It

"
said
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
Delilah

yet
hand
you
over
to

Philistines

<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
shall

"
said
King
;
"
butThe

Dick
Turpin
.
<EOS>
My
nativity
has
been
cast
,
and
the
stars
have
declared
I
am
to
die
by
the
hand
of
my
best
friend
—
and
that
's
you
—
eh
?
<EOS>
Dick?""It
sounds
like
it
,
"
replied
Turpin
;
"
but
I
advise
you
not
to
become
too
intimate
with
Jack
Ketch
.
<EOS>
He
may
prove
your
best
friend
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
,
faith
,
that
's
true
,
"
replied
King
,
laughing
;
"
and
if
I
must
ride
backwards
up
Holborn
Hill
,
I
'll
do
the
thing
in
style
,
and
honest
Jack
Ketch
shall
never
want
his
dues
.
<EOS>
A
man
should
always
die
game
.
<EOS>
We
none
of
us
know
how
soon
our
turn
may
come
;
but
come
when
it
will
,
I
shall
never
flinch
from
it
.
<EOS>
As
the
highwayman
's
life
is
the
fullest
of
zest
,
So
the
highwayman
's
death
is
the
briefest
and
best;He
dies
not
as
other
men
die
,
by
degrees
,
But
at
once
!
<EOS>
without
flinching
—
and
quite
at
his
ease!as
<EOS>
the
song
you
are
so
fond
of
says
.
<EOS>
When
I
die
it
will
not
be
of
consumption
.
<EOS>
And
if
the
surgeon
's
knife
must
come
near
me
,
it
will
be
after
death
.
<EOS>
There
's
some
comfort
in
that
reflection
,
at
all
events
.
<EOS>
""True
,
"
replied
Turpin
,
"
and
,
with
a
little
alteration
,
my
song
would
suit
you
capitally
:
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
king
,
should
you
search
the
world
round
,
So
blithe
as
the
king
's
king
,
Tom
King
,
to
be
found;Dear
woman
's
his
empire
,
each
girl
is
his
own
,
And
he
'd
have
a
long
reign
if
he
'd
let
'em
alone
.
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha!""Ha
,
ha
!
"
laughed
Tom
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
Dick
,
to
change
the
subject
.
<EOS>
You
are
off
,
I
understand
,
to
Yorkshire
to
-
night
.
'
<EOS>
Pon
my
soul
,
you
are
a
wonderful
fellow
—
an
alibi
personified!—here
and
everywhere
at
the
same
time
—
no
wonder
you
are
called
the
flying
highwayman
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
in
town
—
to
-
morrow
at
York
—
the
day
after
at
Chester
.
<EOS>
The
devil
only
knows
where
you
will
pitch
your
quarters
a
week
hence
.
<EOS>
There
are
rumors
of
you
in
all
counties
at
the
same
moment
.
<EOS>
This
man
swears
you
robbed
him
at
Hounslow
;
that
on
Salisbury
Plain
;
while
another
avers
you
monopolize
Cheshire
and
Yorkshire
,
and
that
it
is
n't
safe
even
to
hunt
without
pops
in
your
pocket
.
<EOS>
I
heard
some
devilish
good
stories
of
you
at
D'Osyndar
's
t'other
day
;
the
fellow
who
told
them
to
me
little
thought
I
was
a
brother
blade
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
flatter
me
,
"
said
Dick
,
smiling
complacently
;
<EOS>
"
but
it
's
no
merit
of
mine
.
<EOS>
Black
Bess
alone
enables
me
to
do
it
,
and
hers
be
the
credit
.
<EOS>
Talking
of
being
everywhere
at
the
same
time
,
you
shall
hear
what
she
once
did
for
me
in
Cheshire
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
a
glass
to
the
best
mare
in
England
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
refuse
that
toast
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
if
your
mistress
is
only
as
true
to
you
as
my
nag
to
me
,
you
might
set
at
naught
the
tightest
hempen
cravat
that
was
ever
twisted
,
and
defy
your
best
friend
to
hurt
you
.
<EOS>
Black
Bess
!
<EOS>
and
God
bless
her
!
<EOS>
And
now
for
the
song
.
<EOS>
"
Saying
which
,
with
much
emotion
,
Turpin
chanted
the
following
rhymes
:
BLACK
BESSLet
<EOS>
the
lover
his
mistress
's
beauty
rehearse
,
And
laud
her
attractions
in
languishing
verse;Be
<EOS>
it
mine
in
rude
strains
,
but
with
truth
to
express
,
The
love
that
I
bear
to
my
bonny
Black
Bess
.
<EOS>
From
the
west
was
her
dam
,
from
the
east
was
her
sire
,
From
the
one
came
her
swiftness
,
the
other
her
fire;No
peer
of
the
realm
better
blood
<EOS>
can
possessThan
flows
in
the
veins
of
my
bonny
Black
Bess
.
<EOS>
Look
!
<EOS>
Look
!
<EOS>
how
that
eyeball
grows
bright
as
a
brand!That
neck
proudly
arches
,
those
nostrils
expand!Mark
!
<EOS>
that
wide
flowing
mane
!
<EOS>
of
which
each
silky
tressMight
adorn
prouder
beauties
—
though
none
like
Black
Bess
.
<EOS>
Mark
!
<EOS>
that
skin
sleek
as
velvet
,
and
dusky
as
night
,
With
its
jet
undisfigured
by
one
lock
of
white;That
throat
branched
with
veins
,
prompt
to
charge
or
caressNow
<EOS>
is
she
not
beautiful?—bonny
Black
Bess!Over
highway
and
by
-
way
,
in
rough
and
smooth
weather
<EOS>
,
Some
thousands
of
miles
have
we
journeyed
together;Our
couch
the
same
straw
,
and
our
meal
the
same
messNo
couple
more
constant
than
I
and
Black
Bess
.
<EOS>
By
moonlight
,
in
darkness
,
by
night
,
or
by
day
,
Her
headlong
career
there
is
nothing
can
stay;She
cares
not
for
distance
,
she
knows
not
distress
:
Can
you
show
me
a
courser
to
match
with
Black
Bess?"Egad
!
<EOS>
I
should
think
not
,
"
exclaimed
King
;
"
you
are
as
sentimental
on
the
subject
of
your
mare
,
as
I
am
when
I
think
of
my
darling
Susan
.
<EOS>
But
pardon
my
interruption
.
<EOS>
Pray
proceed
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
me
first
clear
my
throat
,
"
returned
Dick
;
"
and
now
to
resume:"Once
it
happened
in
Cheshire
,
near
Dunham
,
I
poppedOn
a
horseman
alone

<EOS>
whom
I
speedily
stopped;That
<EOS>
I
lightened
his
pockets
you
'll
readily
guess
—
Quick
work

Dick
Turpin
when
mounted
on
Bess
.
<EOS>
Now
it
seems
the
man
knew
me
;

Dick
Turpin
,
"
said
he,"You
shall
swing
for
this
job
,
as
you
live
,
<EOS>
d'ye
see;"I
laughed
at
his
threats
and
his
vows
of
redress;I
was
sure
of
an
alibi
then
with
Black
Bess
.
<EOS>
The
road
was
a
hollow
,
a
sunken
ravine,[95]Overshadowed
completely
by
wood
like
a
screen;I
clambered
the
bank
,
and
I
needs
must
confess
,
That
one
touch
of
the
spur
grazed
the
side
of
Black
Bess
.
<EOS>
Brake
,
brook
,
meadow
,
and
plough'd
field
,
Bess
fleetly
bestrode
,
As
the
crow
wings
her
flight
<EOS>
we
selected
our
road;We
arrived
at
Hough
Green
in
five
minutes
,
or
less
—
<EOS>
My
neck
it
was
saved
by
the
speed
of
Black
Bess
.
<EOS>
Stepping
carelessly
forward
,
I
lounge
on
the
green
,
Taking
excellent
care
that
by
all
I
am
seen;Some
remarks
on
time
's
flight
to
the
squires
I
address
,
But
I
say
not
a
word
of
the
flight
of
Black
Bess
.
<EOS>
I
mention
the
hour
—
it
was
just
about
four
—
<EOS>
Play
a
rubber
at
bowls
—
<EOS>
think
the
danger
is
o'er;When
athwart
my
next
game
,
like
a
checkmate
at
chess
,
<EOS>
Comes
the
horsemen
in
search
of
the
rider
of
Bess
.
<EOS>
What
matter
details
?
<EOS>
Off
with
triumph
<EOS>
I
came;He
swears
to
the
hour
,
and
the
squires
swear
the
same;I
had
robbed
him
at
four!—while
at
four

<EOS>
was
quietly
bowling

After
some
little

the

was
prevailed
upon
to
enliven
the

with
a
strain

he
trolled
forth

manner
:

And

The

the

was
circulated
so
freely

a

<EOS>
"The

said
Dick

and
<EOS>
I
would
willingly
order

I

we

to
satisfy

As
I
said
before

the

<EOS>
""Egad

<EOS>

"
said
King
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid

in

the

would
be
against

.
<EOS>
""Well
,
then
,
the
success
we
anticipate
,
if
you
prefer
it

"
rejoined
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
to
observe
one
thing
more
,
namely
,
that
I
must
insist
upon
standing
Sam

occasion

<EOS>
Not

continued
Dick
,
stepping
out
of
the
arbor
.
<EOS>
"
Here
,
my
old
Admiral
of
the
White
,
what
's
the
reckoning?—what
's
to

I
say?""Let
<EOS>

"
replied
mine
host
of
the
Falstaff
.
<EOS>
"Order

the
black

"
added
Dick
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
mine

"
said
King
,
"
the
sorrel
colt
.
<EOS>
I
'll
ride
with
you
a
mile
or
two
on
the
road
,
Dick
;
perhaps
we
may
stumble
upon
something
.
<EOS>
""Very
likely
.
<EOS>
""We
meet
at
twelve
,
at
D'Osyndar

Jerry
,
"
said
King
,
"
if
nothing
happens
.
<EOS>
""Agreed
,
"
responded
Juniper
.
<EOS>
"What
say
you
to
a
rubber
at
bowls
,
in
the
mean
time
?
"
said
the
Magus
,
taking
his
everlasting
pipe
from
his
lips
.
<EOS>
Jerry
nodded
acquiescence
.
<EOS>
And
while
they
went
in
search
of
the
implements
of
the
game
,
Turpin
and
King
sauntered
gently
on
the
green
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
delicious
evening
.
<EOS>
The
sun
was
slowly
declining
,
and
glowed
like
a
ball
of
fire
amid
the
thick
foliage
of
a
neighboring
elm
.
<EOS>
Whether
,
like
the
robber
Moor
,
Tom
King
was
touched
by
this
glorious
sunset
,
we
pretend
not
to
determine
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
was
that
a
shade
of
inexpressible
melancholy
passed
across
his
handsome
countenance
,
as
he
gazed
in
the
direction
of
Harrow
-
on
-
the
Hill
,
which
,
lying
to
the
west
of
the
green
upon
which
they
walked
,
stood
out
with
its
pointed
spire
and
lofty
college
against
the
ruddy
sky
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
not
.
<EOS>
But
Dick
noticed
the
passing
emotion
.
<EOS>
"What
ails
you
,
Tom
?
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
with
much
kindness
of
manner—"are
<EOS>
you
not
well
,
lad?""Yes
,
I
am
well
enough
,
"
said
King
;
"
I
know
not
what
came
over
me
,
but
looking
at
Harrow
<EOS>
,
I
thought
of
my
school
days
,
and
what
I
was
then
,
and
that
bright
prospect
reminded
me
of
my
boyish
hopes
.
<EOS>
""Tut
—
tut
,
"
said
Dick
,
"
this
is
idle
—
you
are
a
man
now
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
know
I
am
,
"
replied
Tom
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
been
a
boy
.
<EOS>
Had
I
any
faith
in
presentiments
,
I
should
say
this
is
the
last
sunset
I
shall
ever
see
.
<EOS>
""Here
comes
our
host
,
"
said
Dick
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
no
presentiment
that
this
is
the
last
bill
I
shall
ever
pay
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
bill
was
brought
and
settled
.
<EOS>
As
Turpin
paid
it
,
the
man
's
conduct
was
singular
,
and
awakened
his
suspicions
.
<EOS>
"Are
<EOS>
our
horses
ready
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Dick
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"They
are
,
sir
,
"
said
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
us
be
gone
,
"
whispered
Dick
to
King
;
"
I
do
n't
like
this
fellow
's
manner
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
heard
a
carriage
draw
up
at
the
inn
door
just
now
—
there
may
be
danger
.
<EOS>
Be
fly
!
"
added
he
to
Jerry
and
the
Magus
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
sir
,
"
said
he
to
the
landlord
,
"
lead
the
way
.
<EOS>
Keep
on
the
alert
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
"Dick
's
hint
was
not
lost
upon
the
two
bowlers
.
<EOS>
They
watched
their
comrades
;
and
listened
intently
for
any
manifestation
of
alarm
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
III
.
—
<EOS>
A
SURPRISEWas
this
well
done
,
Jenny
?
—
Captain
Macheath
.
<EOS>
WHILE
Turpin
and
King
are
walking
across
the
bowling
-
green
,
we
will
see
what
has
taken
place
outside
the
inn
.
<EOS>
Tom
's
presentiments
of
danger
were
not
,
it
appeared
,
without
foundation
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
the
ostler
brought
forth
our
two
highwaymen
's
steeds
,
when
a
post
-
chaise
,
escorted
by
two
or
three
horsemen
,
drove
furiously
up
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
sole
occupant
of
the
carriage
was
a
lady
,
whose
slight
and
pretty
figure
was
all
that
could
be
distinguished
,
her
face
being
closely
veiled
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
,
who
was
busied
in
casting
up
Turpin
's
account
,
rushed
forth
at
the
summons
.
<EOS>
A
word
or
two
passed
between
him
and
the
horsemen
,
upon
which
the
former
's
countenance
fell
.
<EOS>
He
posted
in
the
direction
of
the
garden
;
and
the
horsemen
instantly
dismounted
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
have
him
now
,
sure
enough
,
"
said
one
of
them
,
a
very
small
man
,
who
looked
,
in
his
boots
,
like
Buckle
equipped
for
the
Oaks
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
the
powers
!
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
so
,
"
replied
the
other
horseman
.
"
<EOS>
But
do
n't
spoil
all
,
Mr.
Coates
,
by
being
too
precipitate
.
<EOS>
""Never
fear
that
,
Mr.
Tyrconnel
,
"
said
Coates
;
for
it
was
the
gallant
attorney
:
"
he
's
sure
to
come
for
his
mare
.
<EOS>
That
's
a
trap
certain
to
catch
him
,
eh
,
Mr.
Paterson
?
<EOS>
With
the
chief
constable
of
Westminster
to
back
us
,
the
devil
's
in
it
if
we
are
not
a
match
for
him
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
for
Tom
King
,
too
,
"
replied
the
chief
constable
;
"
since
his
blowen
's
peached
,
the
game
's
up
with
him
,
too
.
<EOS>
We
've
long
had
an
eye
upon
him
,
and
now
we
'll
have
a
finger
.
<EOS>
He
's
one
of
your
dashing
trouts
to
whom
we
always
give
a
long
line
,
but
we
'll
land
him
this
time
,
anyhow
.
<EOS>
If
you
'll
look
after
Dick
Turpin
,
gemmen
,
I
'll
make
sure
of
Tom
.
<EOS>
""I'd
<EOS>
rather
you
would
help
us
,
Mr.
Paterson
,
"
said
Coates
;
"
never
mind
Tom
King
;
another
time
will
do
for
him
.
<EOS>
""No
such
thing
,
"
said
Paterson
;
"
one
weighs
just
as
much
for
that
matter
as
t'other
.
<EOS>
I
'll
take
Tom
to
myself
,
and
surely
you
two
,
with
the
landlord
and
ostler
,
can
manage
Turpin
amongst
you
.
<EOS>
""I
do
n't
know
that
,
"
said
Coates
,
doubtfully
;
"
he
's
a
devil
of
a
fellow
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
""Take
him
quietly
,
"
said
Paterson
.
<EOS>
"
Draw
the
chaise
out
of
the
way
,
lad
.
<EOS>
Take
our
tits
to
one
side
,
and
place
their
nags
near
the
door
,
ostler
.
<EOS>
Shall
you
be
able
to
see
him
,
ma'am
,
where
you
are
?
"
asked
the
chief
constable
,
walking
to
the
carriage
,
and
touching
his
hat
to
the
lady
within
.
<EOS>
Having

a

nod
from
the
bonnet
and

he
returned
to
his
companions
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
gemmen

"
added
he
,
"
let
's
step
aside
a
little
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
use
your

<EOS>
"As
if
conscious
of
what
was
passing
around
her
,
and
of
the
danger
that
awaited
her
master
,
Black
Bess
exhibited
so
much
impatience
,
and
plunged
so
violently
,
that
it
was
with
difficulty
the
ostler
could
hold
her
.
"
<EOS>
The
devil
's
in
the
mare
,
"
said
he
;
"
what
's
the
matter
with
her
?
<EOS>
She
was
quiet
enough
a
few
minutes
since
.
<EOS>
Soho

<EOS>
"Turpin
<EOS>
and
King
,
meanwhile
,
walked
quickly
through
the
house
,
preceded
by
the
host
,
who
conducted
them
,
and
not
without
some
inward
trepidation
,
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
Arrived
there
,
each
man
rushed
swiftly
to
his
horse
.
<EOS>
Dick
was
in
the
saddle
in
an
instant
,
and
stamping
her
foot
on
the
ostler
's
leg
,
Black
Bess
compelled
the
man
,
yelling
with
pain
,
to
quit
his
hold
of
the
bridle
.
<EOS>
Tom
King
was
not
equally
fortunate
.
<EOS>
Before
he
could
mount
his
horse
,
a
loud
shout
was
raised
,
which
startled
the
animal
,
and
caused
him
to
swerve
,
so
that
Tom
lost
his
footing
in
the
stirrup
,
and
fell
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
He
was
instantly
seized
by
Paterson
,
and
a
struggle
commenced
,
King
endeavoring
,
but
in
vain
,
to
draw
a
pistol
.
<EOS>
"Flip
him,[108
]
Dick
;
fire
,
or
I
'm
taken
,
"
cried
King
.
"
<EOS>
Fire
!
<EOS>
damn
you
,
why
do
n't
you
fire
?
<EOS>
"
shouted
he
,
in
desperation
,
still
struggling
vehemently
with
Paterson
,
who
was
a
strong
man
,
and
more
than
a
match
for
a
light
weight
like
King
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
ca
n't
,
"
cried
Dick
;
"
I
shall
hit
you
,
if
I
fire
.
<EOS>
""Take
your
chance
,
"
shouted
King
.
<EOS>
"
Is
this
your
friendship?"Thus
urged
,
Turpin
fired
.
<EOS>
The
ball
ripped
up
the
sleeve
of
Paterson
's
coat
,
but
did
not
wound
him
.
"Again
!
"
cried
King
.
"
<EOS>
Shoot
him
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
hear
me
?
<EOS>
Fire
again!"Pressed
as
he
was
by
foes
on
every
side
,
himself
their
mark
,
for
both
Coates
and
Tyrconnel
had
fired
upon
him
,
and
were
now
mounting
their
steeds
to
give
chase
,
it
was
impossible
that
Turpin
could
take
sure
aim
;
added
to
which
,
in
the
struggle
,
Paterson
and
King
were
each
moment
changing
their
relative
positions
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
would
no
longer
hesitate
,
but
again
,
at
his
friend
's
request
,
fired
.
<EOS>
The
ball
lodged
itself
in
King
's
breast
!
<EOS>
He
fell
at
once
.
<EOS>
At
this
instant
a
shriek
was
heard
from
the
chaise
:
the
window
was
thrown
open
,
and
her
thick
veil
being
drawn
aside
,
the
features
of
a
very
pretty
female
,
now
impressed
with
terror
and
contrition
,
were
suddenly
exhibited
.
<EOS>
King
fixed
his
glazing
eyes
upon
her
.
"Susan
!
"
<EOS>
sighed
he
,
"
is
it
you
that
I
behold?""Yes
,
yes
,
'
tis
she
,
sure
enough
,
"
said
Paterson
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
ma'am
,
what
you
and
such
like
have
brought
him
to
.
<EOS>
However
,
you
'll
lose
your
reward
;
he
's
going
fast
enough
.
<EOS>
""Reward
!
<EOS>
"
gasped
King
;
"
reward
!
<EOS>
Did
she
betray
me?""Ay
,
ay
,
sir
,
"
said
Paterson
,
"
<EOS>
she
blowed
the
gaff
,
if
it
's
any
consolation
to
you
to
know
it
.
<EOS>
""Consolation
!
"
repeated
the
dying
man
;
"
perfidious!—oh!—the
prophecy
—
my
best
friend
—
Turpin
—
I
die
by
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
vainly
striving
to
raise
himself
,
he
fell
backwards
and
expired
.
<EOS>
Alas
,
poor
Tom!"Mr
.
<EOS>
Paterson
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Paterson
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Coates
;
"
leave
the
landlord
to
look
after
the
body
of
that
dying
ruffian
,
and
mount
with
us
in
pursuit
of
the
living
rascal
.
<EOS>
Come
,
sir
;
quick
!
<EOS>

!
<EOS>

!
<EOS>
You
see
he
is
yonder
;
he
seems
to
hesitate
;
we
shall
have
him
now
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
<EOS>
gemmen
,
I
'm
ready
,
"
said
Paterson
;
"
but
how
the
devil
came
you
to
let
him
escape?""Saint
<EOS>
Patrick
only
knows
!
"
<EOS>
said
Titus
;
"
he
's
as
slippery
as
an
eel
—
and
,
like
a
cat
,
turn
him
which
way
<EOS>
you
will
,
he
is
always
sure
to
alight
upon
his
legs

<EOS>
I
would
n't
wonder
but
we
lose
him
now
,
after
all
,
though
he
has
such
a
small
start

<EOS>
That
mare
flies
like
the
wind
.
<EOS>
""He
shall
have
a
tight
run
for
it
,
at
all
events
,
"
said
Paterson
,
putting
spurs
into
his
horse
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
a
good
nag
under
me
,
and
you
are
neither
of
you
badly
mounted

<EOS>
He
's
only
three
hundred
yards
before
us
,
and
the
devil
's
in
it
if
we
ca
n't
run
him
down
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
three
hundred
pound
job
,
Mr.
Coates
,
and
well
worth
a
race
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
shall
have
another
hundred
from
me
,
sir
,
if
you
take
him
,
"
said
Coates
,
urging
his
steed
forward
.
<EOS>
"Thank
<EOS>
you
,
sir
,
thank
you
.
<EOS>
Follow
my
directions
,
and
we
'll
make
sure
of
him

"
said
the
constable
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Gently
,
gently
,
not
so
fast
up
the
hill
—
you
see
he
's
breathing
his
horse
.
<EOS>
All
in
good
time
,
Mr.
Coates
—
all
in
good
time
,
sir
.
"And
maintaining
an
equal
distance
,
both
parties
cantered
leisurely
up
the
ascent
now
called
Windmill
Hill
.
<EOS>
We
shall
now
return
to
Turpin
.
<EOS>
Aghast
at
the
deed
he
had
accidentally
committed
,
Dick
remained
for
a
few
moments
irresolute
;
he
perceived
that
King
was
mortally
wounded
,
and
that
all
attempts
at
rescue
would
be
fruitless
;
he
perceived
,
likewise
,
that
Jerry
and
the
Magus
had
effected
their
escape
from
the
bowling
-
green
,
as
he
could
detect
their
figures
stealing
along
the
hedge
-
side
.
<EOS>
He
hesitated
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Turning
his
horse
,
he
galloped
slowly
off
,
little
heeding
the
pursuit
with
which
he
was
threatened
.
<EOS>
"Every
<EOS>
bullet
has
its
billet
,
"
said
Dick
;
"
but
little
did
I
think
that
I
really
should
turn
poor
Tom
's
executioner
.
<EOS>
To
the
devil
with
this
rascally
snapper
,
"
cried
he
,
throwing
the
pistol
over
the
hedge
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
never
have
used
it
again
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
strange
,
too
,
that
he
should
have
foretold
his
own
fate
—
devilish
strange
!
<EOS>
And
then
that
he
should
have
been
betrayed
by
the
very
blowen
he
trusted
!
<EOS>
that
's
a
lesson
,
if
I
wanted
any
.
<EOS>
But
trust
a
woman!—not
I
,
the
length
of
my
little

THE

CRYSix
gentlemen
upon
the
roadThus
seeing
Gilpin
fly
,
<EOS>
With
postboy
scampering
in
the
rear
,
They
raised
the
hue
and
cry
:
<EOS>
Stop

<EOS>
stop

<EOS>
a

one
of

was
mute;And
all

each
that

Gilpin
.
<EOS>
ARRIVED
at
the
brow
of
the
hill
,
<EOS>
whence
such
a
beautiful
view
of
the
country
surrounding
the
metropolis
is
obtained,[109
]
<EOS>
Turpin
turned
for
an
instant
to
reconnoitre
his
pursuers
.
<EOS>
Coates
and
Titus
he
utterly
disregarded
;
but
Paterson
was
a
more
formidable
foe
,
and
he
well
knew
that
he
had
to
deal
with
a
man
of
experience
and
resolution
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
the
thoughts
of
executing
his
extraordinary
ride
to
York
first
flashed
across
him
;
his
bosom
throbbed
high
with
rapture
,
and
he
involuntarily
exclaimed
aloud
,
as
he
raised
himself
in
the
saddle
,
"
By
God
!
<EOS>
I
will
do
<EOS>
it!"He
took
one
last
look
at
the
great
Babel
that
lay
buried
in
a
world
of
trees
beneath
him
;
and
as
his
quick
eye
ranged
over
the
magnificent
prospect
,
lit
up
by
that
gorgeous
sunset
,
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
Tom
King
's
last
words
.
<EOS>
"
Poor
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
thought
Dick
,
"
he
said
truly
.
<EOS>
He
will
never
see
another
sunset
.
"
<EOS>
Aroused
by
the
approaching
clatter
of
his
pursuers
,
Dick
struck
into
a
lane
which
lies
on
the
right
of
the
road
,
now
called
Shoot
-
up
-
hill
Lane
,
and
set
off
at
a
good
pace
in
the
direction
of
Hampstead
.
"Now
,
"
cried
Paterson
,
"
put
your
tits
to
it
,
my
boys
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
lose
sight
of
him
for
a
second
in
these
lanes
.
<EOS>
"Accordingly
,
as
Turpin
was
by
no
means
desirous
of
inconveniencing
his
mare
in
this
early
stage
of
the
business
,
and
as
the
ground
was
still
upon
an
ascent
,
the
parties
preserved
their
relative
distances
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
after
various
twistings
and
turnings
in
that
deep
and
devious
lane
;
after
scaring
one
or
two
farmers
,
and
riding
over
a
brood
or
two
of
ducks
;
dipping
into
the
verdant
valley
of
West
End
,
and
ascending
another
hill
,
Turpin
burst
upon
the
gorsy
,
sandy
,
and
beautiful
heath
of
Hampstead
.
<EOS>
Shaping
his
course
to
the
left
,
Dick
then
made
for
the
lower
part
of
the
heath
,
and
skirted
a
path
that
leads
towards
North
End
,
passing
the
furze
-
crowned
summit
which
is
now
crested
by
a
clump
of
lofty
pines
.
<EOS>
It
was
here
that
the
chase
first
assumed
a
character
of
interest
.
<EOS>
Being
open
ground
,
the
pursued
and
pursuers
were
in
full
view
of
each
other
;
and
as
Dick
rode
swiftly
across
the
heath
,
with
the
shouting
trio
hard
at
his
heels
,
the
scene
had
a
very
animated
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
crossed
the
hill
—
the
Hendon
Road
—
passed
Crackskull
Common
—
and
dashed
along
the
cross
road
to
Highgate
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
no
advantage
had
been
gained
by
the
pursuers
;
they
had
not
lost
ground
,
but
still
they
had
not
gained
an
inch
,
and
much
spurring
was
required
to
maintain
their
position
.
<EOS>
As
they
approached
Highgate
,
Dick
slackened
his
pace
,
and
the
other
party
redoubled
their
efforts
.
<EOS>
To
avoid
the
town
,
Dick
struck
into
a
narrow
path
at
the
right
,
and
rode
easily
down
the
hill
.
<EOS>
His
pursuers
were
now
within
a
hundred
yards
,
and
shouted
to
him
to
stand
.
<EOS>
Pointing
to
a
gate
which
seemed
to
bar
their
further
progress
,
Dick
unhesitatingly
charged
it
,
clearing
it
in
beautiful
style
.
<EOS>
Not
so
with
Coates
's
party
;
and
the
time
they
lost
in
unfastening
the
gate
,
which
none
of
them
chose
to
leap
,
enabled
Dick
to
put
additional
space
betwixt
them
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
,
however
,
appear
to
be
his
intention
altogether
to
outstrip
his
pursuers
:
the
chase
seemed
to
give
him
excitement
,
which
he
was
willing
to
prolong
as
much
as
was
consistent
with
his
safety
.
<EOS>
Scudding
rapidly
past
Highgate
,
like
a
swift
-
sailing
schooner
,
with
three
lumbering
Indiamen
in
her
wake
,
Dick
now
took
the
lead
along
a
narrow
lane
that
threads
the
fields
in
the
direction
of
Hornsey
.
<EOS>
The
shouts
of
his
followers
had
brought
others
to
join
them
,
and
as
he
neared
Crouch
End
,
traversing
the
lane
which
takes
its
name
from
Du
-
Val
,
and
in
which
a
house
frequented
by
that
gayest
of
robbers
stands
,
or
stood
,
"
A
highwayman
!
<EOS>
a
highwayman
!
"
<EOS>
rang
in
his
ears
,
in
a
discordant
chorus
of
many
voices
.
<EOS>
The
whole
neighborhood
was
alarmed
by
the
cries
,
and
by
the
tramp
of
horses
:
the
men
of
Hornsey
rushed
into
the
road
to
seize
the
fugitive
,
and
women
held
up
their
babes
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
flying
cavalcade
,
which
seemed
to
gain
number
and
animation
as
it
advanced
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
three
horsemen
appear
in
the
road
—
they
hear
the
uproar
and
the
din
.
"
<EOS>
A
highwayman
!
<EOS>
a
highwayman
!
"
cry
the
voices
:
<EOS>
"
stop
him
,
stop
him
!
"
<EOS>
But
it
is
no
such
easy
matter
.
<EOS>
With
a
pistol
in
each
hand
,
and
his
bridle
in
his
teeth
,
Turpin
passed
boldly
on
.
<EOS>
His
fierce
looks
—
his
furious
steed
—
the
impetus
with
which
he
pressed
forward
,
bore
down
all
before
him
.
<EOS>
The
horsemen
gave
way
,
and
only
served
to
swell
the
list
of
his
pursuers
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
have
him
now
—
we
have
him
now
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Paterson
,
exultingly
.
<EOS>
"
Shout
for
your
lives
.
<EOS>
The
turnpike
man
will
hear
us
.
<EOS>
Shout
again
—
again
!
<EOS>
The
fellow
has
heard
it
.
<EOS>
The
gate
is
shut
.
<EOS>
We
have
him
.
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha!"The
old
Hornsey
toll
-
bar
was
a
high
gate
,
with
chevaux
-
de
-
frise
on
the
upper
rail
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
so
still
.
<EOS>
The
gate
was
swung
into
its
lock
,
and
,
like
a
tiger
in
his
lair
,
the
prompt
custodian
of
the
turnpike
trusts
,
ensconced
within
his
doorway
,
held
himself
in
readiness
to
spring
upon
the
runaway
.
<EOS>
But
Dick
kept
steadily
on
.
<EOS>
He
coolly
calculated
the
height
of
the
gate
;
he
looked
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
—
nothing
better
offered
;
he
spoke
a
few
words
of
encouragement
to
Bess
,
gently
patted
her
neck
,
then
struck
his
spurs
into
her
sides
,
and
cleared
the
spikes
by
an
inch
.
<EOS>
Out
rushed
the
amazed
turnpike
man
,
thus
unmercifully
bilked
,
and
was
nearly
trampled
to
death
under
the

sturdily

Paterson
,
showing
his

How

you

in

said
the

doggedly

<EOS>
"
But
you

the

on

<EOS>
"Amidst
<EOS>
a
storm
of
oaths
,
Coates
flung
down
a
crown
piece
,
and
the
gate
was
thrown
open
.
<EOS>
Turpin
took
advantage
of
this
delay
to
breathe
his
mare
;
and
,
striking
into
a
by
-
lane
at
Duckett
's
Green
,
cantered
easily
along
in
the
direction
of
Tottenham
.
<EOS>
Little
repose
was
allowed
him
.
<EOS>
Yelling
like
a
pack
of
hounds
in
full
cry
,
his
pursuers
were
again
at
his
heels
.
<EOS>
He
had
now
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
long
straggling
town
of
Tottenham
,
and
various
were
the
devices
of
the
populace
to
entrap
him
.
<EOS>
The
whole
place
was
up
in
arms
,
shouting
,
screaming
,
running
,
dancing
,
and
hurling
every
possible
description
of
missile
at
the
horse
and
her
rider
.
<EOS>
Dick
merrily
responded
to
their
clamor
as
he
flew
past
,
and
laughed
at
the
brickbats
that
were
showered
thick
as
hail
,
and
quite
as
harmlessly
,
around
him
.
<EOS>
A
few
more
miles
'
hard
riding
tired
the
volunteers
,
and
before
the
chase
reached
Edmonton
<EOS>
most
of
them
were
"
nowhere
.
"
<EOS>
Here
fresh
relays
were
gathered
,
and
a
strong
field
was
again
mustered
.
<EOS>
John
Gilpin
himself
could
not
have
excited
more
astonishment
amongst
the
good
folks
of
Edmonton
,
than
did
our
highwayman
as
he
galloped
through
their
town
.
<EOS>
Unlike
the
men
of
Tottenham
,
the
mob
received
him
with
acclamations
,
thinking
,
no
doubt
,
that
,
like
"
the
citizens
of
famous
London
town
,
"
he
rode
for
a
wager
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
however
,
borne
on
the
wings
of
the
blast
,
came
the
cries
of
"
Turpin
!
<EOS>
Dick
Turpin
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
hurrahs
were
changed
to
hootings
;
but
such
was
the
rate
at
which
our
highwayman
rode
,
that
no
serious
opposition
could
be
offered
to
him
.
<EOS>
A
man
in
a
donkey
-
cart
,
unable
to
get
out
of
the
way
,
drew
himself
up
in
the
middle
of
the
road
.
<EOS>
Turpin
treated
him
as
he
had
done
the
dub
at
the
knapping
jigger
,
and
cleared
the
driver
and
his
little
wain
with
ease
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
capital
stroke
,
and
well
adapted
to
please
the
multitude
,
who
are
ever
taken
with
a
brilliant
action
.

Hark
away

THE
SHORT
<EOS>
PIPEThe
Peons
are
capital
horsemen
,
and
several
times
we
saw
them
,
at
a
gallop
,
throw
the
rein
on
the
horse
's
neck
,
take
from
one
pocket
a
bag
of
loose
tobacco
,
and
,
with
a
piece
of
paper
,
or
a
leaf
of
Indian
corn
,
make

then
take
out

<EOS>
AWAY
<EOS>
they
fly
past
scattered
cottages
,
swiftly
and
skimmingly
,
like
eagles
on
the
wing
,
along
the
Enfield
highway
.
<EOS>
All
were
well
mounted
,
and
<EOS>
the
horses
,
now
thoroughly
warmed
,
had
got
into
their
paces
,
and
did
their
work
beautifully
.
<EOS>
None
of
Coates
's
party
lost
ground
,
but
they
maintained
it
at
the
expense
of
their
steeds
,
which
were
streaming
like
water
-
carts
,
while
Black
Bess
had
scarcely
turned
a
hair
.
<EOS>
Turpin
,
the
reader
already
knows
,
was
a
crack
rider
;
he
was
the
crack
rider
of
England
of
his
time
,
and
,
perhaps
,
of
any
time
.
<EOS>
The
craft
and
mystery
of
jockeyship
was
not
so
well
understood
in
the
eighteenth
as
it
is
in
the
nineteenth
century
;
men
treated
their
horses
differently
,
and
few
rode
them
as
well
as
many
ride
now
,
when
every
youngster
takes
to
the
field
as
naturally
as
if
he
had
been
bred
a
Guacho
.
<EOS>
Dick
Turpin
was
a
glorious
exception
to
the
rule
,
and
anticipated
a
later
age
.
<EOS>
He
rode
wonderfully
lightly
,
yet
sat
his
saddle
to
perfection
,
distributing
the
weight
so
exquisitely
that
his
horse
scarcely
felt
his
pressure
;
he
yielded
to
every
movement
made
by
the
animal
,
and
became
,
as
it
were
,
part
and
parcel
of
itself
;
he
took
care
Bess
should
be
neither
strained
nor
wrung
.
<EOS>
Freely
,
and
as
lightly
as
a
feather
,
was
she
borne
along
;
beautiful
was
it
to
see
her
action
—
to
watch
her
style
and
temper
of
covering
the
ground
;
and
many
a
first
-
rate
Meltonian
might
have
got
a
wrinkle
from
Turpin
's
seat
and
conduct
.
<EOS>
We
have
before
stated
that
it
was
not
Dick
's
object
to
ride
away
from
his
pursuers
—
he
could
have
done
that
at
any
moment
.
<EOS>
He
liked
the
fun
of
the
chase
,
and
would
have
been
sorry
to
put
a
period
to
his
own
excitement
.
<EOS>
Confident
in
his
mare
,
he
just
kept
her
at
such
speed
as
should
put
his
pursuers
completely
to
it
,
without
in
the
slightest
degree
inconveniencing
himself
.
<EOS>
Some
judgment
of
the
speed
at
which
they
went
may
be
formed
,
when
we
state
that
little
better
than
an
hour
had
elapsed
and
nearly
twenty
miles
had
been
ridden
over
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
bad
travelling

,

methinks
we
hear
the
reader
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"By

said
Titus
,
as
they

but
which
required
a
plentiful
exercise
both
of
leg
and
arm
to
call
forth
all
his
action
,
and
keep
his
rider
alongside
his
companions—"by
the
mother
that
bore
me

said
he
,
almost
thumping
the
wind
out
of
his
flea

bitten
Bucephalus
with
his
calves
,
after
the
Irish
fashion
,
"

there
he
goes

"Pæans

what
the
gallant

extols
so
loudly
in
the
South
American
horsemen
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
the
lighting
of
a
cigar
when
in
mid
career
,
was
accomplished
with
equal
ease
by
our
English
highwayman
a
hundred
years
ago
,
nor
was
it
esteemed
by
him
any
extravagant
feat
either
.
<EOS>
Flint
,
steel
,
and
tinder
were
bestowed
within
Dick
's
ample
pouch
,
the
short
pipe
was
at
hand
,
and
within
a
few
seconds
there
was
a
stream
of
vapor
exhaling
from
his
lips
,
like
the
smoke
from
a
steamboat
shooting
down
the
river
,
and
tracking
his
still
rapid
course
through
the
air
.
<EOS>
"I'll
let
'em
see
what
I
think
of
'
em
!
"
<EOS>
said
Dick
,
coolly
,
as
he
turned
his
head
.
<EOS>
IllustrationIt
was
now
gray
twilight
.
<EOS>
The
mists
of
coming
night
were
weaving
a
thin
curtain
over
the
rich
surrounding
landscape
.
<EOS>
All
the
sounds
and
hum
of
that
delicious
hour
were
heard
,
broken
only
by
the
regular
clatter
of
the
horses
'
hoofs
.
<EOS>
Tired
of
shouting
,
the
chasers
now
kept
on
their
way
in
deep
silence
;
each
man
held
his
breath
,
and
plunged
his
spurs
,
rowel
deep
,
into
his
horse
;
but
the
animals
were
already
at
the
top
of
their
speed
,
and
incapable
of
greater
exertion
.
<EOS>
Paterson
,
who
was
a
hard
rider
,
and
perhaps
a
thought
better
mounted
,
kept
the
lead
.
<EOS>
The
rest
followed
as
they
might
.
<EOS>
Had
it
been
undisturbed
by
the
rush
of
the
cavalcade
,
the
scene
would
have
been
still
and
soothing
.
<EOS>
Overhead
a
cloud
of
rooks
were
winging
their
garrulous
flight
to
the
ancestral
avenue
of
an
ancient
mansion
to
the
right
;
the
bat
was
on
the
wing
;
the
distant
lowing
of
a
herd
of
kine
saluted
the
ear
at
intervals
;
the
blithe
whistle
of
the
rustic
herdsman
,
and
the
merry
chime
of
waggon
bells
,
rang
pleasantly
from
afar
.
<EOS>
But
these
cheerful
sounds
,
which
make
the
still
twilight
hour
delightful
,
were
lost
in
the
tramp
of
the
horsemen
,
now
three
abreast
.
<EOS>
The
hind
fled
to
the
hedge
for
shelter
,
and
the
waggoner
pricked
up
his
ears
,
and
fancied
he
heard
the
distant
rumbling
of
an
earthquake
.
<EOS>
On
rush
the
pack
,
whipping
,
spurring
,
tugging
for
very
life
.
<EOS>
Again
they
gave
voice
,
in
hopes
the
waggoner
might
succeed
in
stopping
the
fugitive
.
<EOS>
But
Dick
was
already
by
his
side
.
"
<EOS>
Harkee
,

"
cried
he
,
taking
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
as
he
passed
,
"

my
friends
behind

will
hear
of
me
at
York
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
did
he
say
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Paterson
,
coming
up
the
next
moment
.
<EOS>
"That
<EOS>
you
'll
find
him
at
York
,
"
replied
the
waggoner
.
<EOS>
"At
York
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Coates
,
in
amaze
.
<EOS>
Turpin
was
now
out
of
sight
,
and
although
our
trio
flogged
with
might
and
main
,
they
could
never
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
until
,
within
a
short
distance
of
Ware
,
they
beheld
him
at
the
door
of
a
little
public
house
,
standing
with
his
bridle
in
his
hand
,
coolly
quaffing
a
tankard
of
ale
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
were
they
in
sight
,
than
Dick
vaulted
into
the
saddle
,
and
rode
off
.
<EOS>
"Devil

did

rode
up

retreated
to

<EOS>
"That

to

they
went

,
with
as
little
delay
as
circumstances
admitted
,
fresh
hacks
being
procured
,
accompanied
by
a
postilion
,
the
party
again
pursued
their
onward
course

encouraged
to
believe
they
were
still
in
the
right
scent

<EOS>
Night
had
now
spread
her
mantle
over
the
earth
;
still
it
was
not
wholly
dark
.
<EOS>
A
few
stars
were
twinkling
in
the
deep
,
cloudless
heavens
,
and
a
pearly
radiance
in
the
eastern
horizon
heralded
the
rising
of
the
orb
of
night
.
<EOS>
A
gentle
breeze
was
stirring
;
the
dews
of
evening
had
already
fallen
;
and
the
air
felt
bland
and
dry

<EOS>
It
was
just
the
night
one
would
have
chosen
for
a
ride
,
if
one
ever
rode
by
choice
at
such
an
hour
;
and
to
Turpin
,
whose
chief
excursions
were
conducted
by
night
,
it
appeared
little
less
than
heavenly
.
<EOS>
Full
of
ardor
and
excitement
,
determined
to
execute
what
he
had
mentally
undertaken
,
Turpin
held
on
his
solitary
course
.
<EOS>
Everything
was
favorable
to
his
project
;
the
roads
were
in
admirable
condition

his
mare
was
in
like
order

she
was
inured
to
hard
work

had
rested
sufficiently
in

recover
from
the
fatigue
of
her
recent
journey

has
now
got
her
wind
in
her
,
"
said
Dick
;
"
I
'll
see
what
she
can
do
—
hark
away
,
lass
—
hark
away
!
<EOS>
I
wish
they
could
see
her
now
,
"
added
he
,
as
he
felt
her
almost
fly
away
with
him
.
<EOS>
Encouraged
by
her
master
's
voice
and
hand
,
Black
Bess
started
forward
at
a
pace
which
few
horses
could
have
equalled
,
and
scarcely
any
have
sustained
so
long
.
<EOS>
Even
Dick
,
accustomed
as
he
was
to
her
magnificent
action
,
felt
electrified
at
the
speed
with
which
he
was
borne
along
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Bravo
!
bravo
!
"
<EOS>
shouted
he
,
"
hark
away
,
Bess!"The
deep
and
solemn
woods
through
which
they
were
rushing
rang
with
his
shouts
,
and
the
sharp
rattle
of
Bess
's
hoofs
;
and
thus
he
held
his
way
,
while
,
in
the
words
of
the
ballad
,
Fled
past
,
on
right
and
left
,
how
fast
,
Each
forest
,
grove
,
and
bower;On
<EOS>
right
and
left
,
fled
past

how
fast

<EOS>
I
will
not
change
my
horse
with
any
that
treads
<EOS>
but
on
four
pasterns
.
<EOS>
Ça
,
ha
!
<EOS>
He
bounds
from
the
earth
as
if
his
entrails
were
hairs
;
le
cheval
volant
,
the
Pegasus
qui
a
les
narines
de
feu
!
<EOS>
When
I
bestride
him
,
I
soar
,
I
am
a
hawk
:
he
trots
the
air
;
the
earth
sings
when
he
touches
it
;
the
basest
horn
of
his
hoof
is
more
musical
than
the
pipe
of
Hermes.—Shakespeare

BESS
<EOS>
being
undoubtedly
the
heroine
of
the
Fourth
Book
of
this
Romance
,
we
may
,
perhaps
,
be
pardoned
for
expatiating
a
little
in
this
place
upon
her
birth
,
parentage
,
breeding
,
appearance
,
and
attractions
.
<EOS>
And
first
as
to
her
pedigree
;
for
in
the
horse
,
unlike
the
human
species
,
nature
has
strongly
impressed
the
noble
or
ignoble
caste
.
<EOS>
He
is
the
real
aristocrat
,
and
the
pure
blood
that
flows
in
the
veins
of
the
gallant
steed
will
infallibly
be
transmitted
,
if
his
mate
be
suitable
,
throughout
all
his
line
.
<EOS>
Bess
was
no
cock
-
tail
.
<EOS>
She
was
thorough
-
bred
;
she
boasted
blood
in
every
bright
and
branching
vein
:
If
blood
can
give
nobility
,
A
noble
steed
was
she;Her
sire
was
blood
,
and
blood
her
dam
,
And
all
her
pedigree
.
<EOS>
As
to
her
pedigree
.
<EOS>
Her
sire
was
a
desert
Arab
,
renowned
in
his
day
,
and
brought
to
this
country
by
a
wealthy
traveller
;
her
dam
was
an
English
racer
,
coal
-
black
as
her
child
.
<EOS>
Bess
united
all
the
fire
and
gentleness
,
the
strength
and
hardihood
,
the
abstinence
and
endurance
of
fatigue
of
the
one
,
with
the
spirit
and
extraordinary
fleetness
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
How
Turpin
became
possessed
of
her
is
of
little
consequence
.
<EOS>
We
never
heard
that
he
paid
a
heavy
price
for
her
;
though
we
doubt
if
any
sum
would
have
induced
him
to
part
with
her
.
<EOS>
In
color
,
she
was
perfectly
black
,
with
a
skin
smooth
on
the
surface
as
polished
jet
;
not
a
single
white
hair
could
be
detected
in
her
satin
coat
.
<EOS>
In
make
she
was
magnificent
.
<EOS>
Every
point
was
perfect
,
beautiful
,
compact
;
modelled
,
in
little
,
for
strength
and
speed
.
<EOS>
Arched
was
her
neck
,
as
that
of
the
swan
;
clean
and
fine
were
her
lower
limbs
,
as
those
of
the
gazelle
;
<EOS>
round
and
sound
as
a
drum
was
her
carcase
,
and
as
broad
as
a
cloth
-
yard
shaft
her
width
of
chest
.
<EOS>
Hers
were
the
"
pulchræ
clunes
,
breve
caput
,
arduaque
cervix
,
"
of
the
Roman
bard
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
redundancy
of
flesh
,
'
tis
true
;
her
flanks
might
,
to
please
some
tastes
,
have
been
rounder
,
and
her
shoulders
fuller
;
but
look
at
the
nerve
and
sinew
,
palpable
through
the
veined
limbs
!
<EOS>
She
was
built
more
for
strength
than
beauty
,
and
yet
she
was
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Look
at
that
elegant
little
head
;
those
thin
,
tapering
ears
,
closely
placed
together
;
that
broad
,
snorting
nostril
,
which
seems
to
snuff
the
gale
with
disdain
;
that
eye
,
glowing
and
large
as
the
diamond
of
Giamschid
!
<EOS>
Is
she
not
beautiful
?
<EOS>
Behold
her
paces
!
<EOS>
how
gracefully
she
moves
!
<EOS>
She
is
off!—no
eagle
on
the
wing
could
skim
the
air
more
swiftly
.
<EOS>
Is
she
not
superb
?
<EOS>
As
to
her
temper
,
the
lamb
is
not
more
gentle
.
<EOS>
A
child
might
guide
her
.
<EOS>
But
hark
back
to
Dick
Turpin
.
<EOS>
We
left
him
rattling
along
in
superb
style
,
and
in
the
highest
possible
glee
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
in
fact
,
be
otherwise
than
exhilarated
;
nothing
being
so
wildly
intoxicating
as
a
mad
gallop
.
<EOS>
We
seem
to
start
out
of
ourselves
—
to
be
endued
,
for
the
time
,
with
new
energies
.
<EOS>
Our
thoughts
take
wings
rapid
as
our
steed
.
<EOS>
We
feel
as
if
his
fleetness
and
boundless
impulses
were
for
the
moment
our
own
.
<EOS>
We
laugh
;
we
exult
;
we
shout
for
very
joy
.
<EOS>
We
cry
out
with
Mephistopheles
,
but
in
anything
but
a
sardonic
mood
,
"
What
I
enjoy
with
spirit
,
is
it
the
less
my
own
on
that
account
?
<EOS>
If
I
can
pay
for
six
horses
,
are
not
their
powers
mine
!
<EOS>
I
drive
along
,
and
am
a
proper
man
,
as
if
I
had
four
-
and
-
twenty
legs
!
<EOS>
"
These
were
Turpin
's
sentiments
precisely
.
<EOS>
Give
him
four
legs
and
a
wide
plain
,
and
he
needed
no
Mephistopheles
to
bid
him
ride
to
perdition
as
fast
as
his
nag
could
carry
him
.
<EOS>
Away
,
away!—the
road
is
level
,
the
path
is
clear
.
<EOS>
Press
on
,
thou
gallant
steed
,
<EOS>
no
obstacle
is
in
thy
way!—and
,
lo
!
<EOS>
the
moon
breaks
forth
!
<EOS>
Her
silvery
light
is
thrown
over
the
woody
landscape
.
<EOS>
Dark
shadows
are
cast
athwart
the
road
,
and
the
flying
figures
of
thy
rider
and
thyself
are
traced
,
like
giant
phantoms
,
in
the
dust!Away
,
away
!
<EOS>
our
breath
is
gone
in
keeping
up
with
this
tremendous
run
.
<EOS>
Yet
Dick
Turpin
has
not
lost
his
wind
,
for
we
hear
his
cheering
cry
—
hark
!
<EOS>
he
sings
.
<EOS>
The
reader
will
bear
in
mind
that
Oliver
means
the
moon
—
to
"
whiddle
"
is
to
blab

down
upon

he
peers
and
stares?Mind
him
who

Boldly

"

"
soliloquized
Dick
,
as
he
concluded
his
song
,
looking
up
at
the
moon
.
"
<EOS>
Old
Noll
's
no
bad
fellow
,
either
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
be
without
his
white
face
to
-
night
for
a
trifle
.
<EOS>
He
's
as
good
as
a
lamp
to
guide
one
,
and
let
Bess
only
hold
on
as
she
goes
now
,
and
I
'll
do
it
with
ease
.
<EOS>
Softly

softly

<EOS>
The

cares
for
nothing

"
<EOS>
And
as
they
ascended
the
hill
,
Dick
's
voice
once
more
awoke
the
echoes
of
night
.

<EOS>
One
night
,
when
mounted
on
my
mare
,
To
Bagshot
Heath
<EOS>
I
did
repair
,
And
saw
Will
Davies
hanging
there
,
Upon
the
gibbet
bleak
and
bare
,
<EOS>
With
a
rustified

fustified

mustified

his

bold

looked
blue

<EOS>
Gone
were
his

too

Which
served
their

well

and
true;Says

,
"

tree
,
With
his
rustified

fustified

mustified

,
"
mused
Turpin
<EOS>
,
"
I
suppose
one
day
it
will
be
with
me
like
all
the
rest
of
'em
,
and
that
I
shall
dance
a
long
lavolta
to
the
music
of
the
four
whistling
winds
,
as
my
betters
have
done
before
me
;
but
I
trust
,
whenever
the
chanter
-
culls
and
last
-
speech
scribblers
get
hold
of
me
,
they
'll
at
least
put
no
cursed
nonsense
into
my
mouth
,
but
make
me
speak
,
as
I
have
ever
felt
,
like
a
man
who
never
either
feared
death
,
or
turned
his
back
upon
his
friend
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
I
'll
give
them
something
to
talk
about
.
<EOS>
This
ride
of
mine
shall
ring
in
their
ears
long
after
I
'm
done
for
—
put
to
bed
with
a
mattock
,
and
tucked
up
with
a
spade
.
<EOS>
And
when
I
am
gone
,
boys
,
each
huntsman
shall
say
,
None
rode
like
Dick
Turpin
,
so
far
in
a
day
.
<EOS>
And
thou
,
too
,
brave
Bess!—thy
name
shall
be
linked
with
mine
,
and
we
'll
go
down
to
posterity
together
;
and
what
,
"
added
he
,
despondingly
,
"
if
it
should
be
too
much
for
thee
?
<EOS>
what
if
——
<EOS>
but
no
matter
!
<EOS>
Better
die
now
,
while
I
am
with
thee
,
than
fall
into
the
knacker
's
hands
.
<EOS>
Better
die
with
all
thy
honors
upon
thy
head
,
than
drag
out
thy
old
age
at
the
sand
-
cart
.
<EOS>
Hark
forward
,
lass
—
hark
forward!"By
<EOS>
what
peculiar
instinct
is
it
that
this
noble
animal
,
the
horse
,
will
at
once
perceive
the
slightest
change
in
his
rider
's
physical
temperament
,
and
allow
himself
so
to
be
influenced
by
it
,
that
,
according
as
his
master
's
spirits
fluctuate
,
will
his
own
energies
rise
and
fall
,
waveringFrom
walk
to
trot
,
from
canter
to
full
speed?How
<EOS>
is
it
<EOS>
,
we
ask
of
those
more
intimately
acquainted
with
the
metaphysics
of
the
Houyhnhnm
than
we
pretend
to
be
?
<EOS>
Do
the
saddle
or
the
rein
convey
,
like
metallic
tractors
,
vibrations
of
the
spirit
betwixt
the
two
?
<EOS>
We
know
not
,
but
this
much
is
certain
,
that
no
servant
partakes
so
much
of
the
character
of
his
master
as
the
horse
.
<EOS>
The
steed
we
are
wo
nt
to
ride
becomes
a
portion
of
ourselves
.
<EOS>
He
thinks
and
feels
with
us
.
<EOS>
As
we
are
lively
,
he
is
sprightly
;
as
we
are
depressed
,
his
courage
droops
.
<EOS>
In
proof
of
this
,
let
the
reader
see
what
horses
some
men
make
<EOS>
—
make
,
we
say
,
because
in
such
hands
their
character
is
wholly
altered
.
<EOS>
Partaking
,
in
a
measure
,
of
the
courage
and
the
firmness
of
the
hand
that
guides
them
,
and
of
the
resolution
of
the
frame
that
sways
them
—
what
their
rider
wills
,
they
do
,
or
strive
to
do
.
<EOS>
When
that
governing
power
is
relaxed
,
their
energies
are
relaxed
likewise
;
and
their
fine
sensibilities
supply
them
with
an
instant
knowledge
of
the
disposition
and
capacity
of
the
rider
.
<EOS>
A
gift
of
the
gods
is
the
gallant
steed
,
which
,
like
any
other
faculty
we
possess
,
to
use
or
to
abuse
—
to
command
or
to
neglect
—
rests
with
ourselves
;
he
is
the
best
general
test
of
our
own
self
-
government
.
<EOS>
Black
Bess
's
action
amply
verified
what
we
have
just
asserted
;
for
during
Turpin
's
momentary
despondency
,
her
pace
was
perceptibly
diminished
and
her
force
retarded
;
but
as
he
revived
,
she
rallied
instantly
,
and
,
seized
apparently
with
a
kindred
enthusiasm
,
snorted
joyously
as
she
recovered
her
speed
.
<EOS>
Now
was
it
that
the
child
of
the
desert
showed
herself
the
undoubted
offspring
of
the
hardy
loins
from
whence
she
sprung
.
<EOS>
Full
fifty
miles
had
she
sped
,
yet
she
showed
no
symptoms
of
distress
.
<EOS>
If
possible
,
she
appeared
fresher
than
when
she
started
.
<EOS>
She
had
breathed
;
her
limbs
were
suppler
;
her
action
was
freer
,
easier
,
lighter
.
<EOS>
Her
sire
,
who
,
upon
his
trackless
wilds
,
could
have
outstripped
the
pestilent
simoom
;
and
with
throat
unslaked
,
and
hunger
unappeased
,
could
thrice
have
seen
the
scorching
sun
go
down
,
had
not
greater
powers
of
endurance
.
<EOS>
His
vigor
was
her
heritage
.
<EOS>
Her
dam
,
who
upon
the
velvet
sod
was
of
almost
unapproachable
swiftness
,
and
who
had
often
brought
her
owner
golden
assurances
of
her
worth
,
could
scarce
have
kept
pace
with
her
,
and
would
have
sunk
under
a
third
of
her
fatigue
.
<EOS>
But
Bess
was
a
paragon
.
<EOS>
We
ne'er
shall
look
upon
her
like
again
,
unless
we
can

to
return
to
Bess

or
rather
to
go
along

for
there
is
no

we

sailing

<EOS>
Bess
is
now
in
her
speed
,
and
Dick
happy
.
<EOS>
Happy
!
<EOS>
he
is
enraptured
—
maddened
—
furious
—
intoxicated
as
with
wine
.
<EOS>
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
wine
could
never
throw
him
into
such
a
burning
delirium
.
<EOS>
Its
choicest
juices
have
no
inspiration
like
this
.
<EOS>
Its
fumes
are
slow
and
heady
.
<EOS>
This
is
ethereal
,
transporting
.
<EOS>
His
blood
spins
through
his
veins
;
winds
round
his
heart
;
mounts
to
his
brain
.
<EOS>
Away
!
<EOS>
away
!
<EOS>
He
is
wild
with
joy
.
<EOS>
Hall

and
vanish
as

<EOS>
Motion
is
scarcely
perceptible
—
it
is
impetus
!
<EOS>
volition
!
<EOS>
The
horse
and
her
rider
are
driven
forward
,
as
it
were
,
by
self
-
accelerated
speed
.
<EOS>
A
hamlet
is
visible
in
the
moonlight
.
<EOS>
It
is
scarcely
discovered
ere
<EOS>
the
flints
sparkle
beneath
the
mare
's
hoofs
.
<EOS>
A
moment
's
clatter
upon
the
stones
,
and
it
is
left
behind
.
<EOS>
Again
it
is
the
silent
,
smiling
country
.
<EOS>
Now
they
are
buried
in
the
darkness
of
woods
;
now
sweeping
along
on
the
wide
plain
;
now
clearing
the
unopened
toll
-
bar
;
now
trampling
over
the
hollow
-
sounding
bridge
,
their
shadows
momently
reflected
in
the
placid
mirror
of
the
stream
;
now
scaling
the
hill
-
side
a
thought
more
slowly
;
now
plunging
,
as
the
horses
of
Phoebus
into
the
ocean
,
down
its
precipitous
sides
.
<EOS>
The
limits
of
two
shires
are
already
past
.
<EOS>
They
are
within
the
confines
of
a
third
.
<EOS>
They
have
entered
the
merry
county
of
Huntingdon
;
they
have
surmounted
the
gentle
hill
that
slips
into
Godmanchester
.
<EOS>
They
are
by
the
banks
of
the
rapid
Ouse
.
<EOS>
The
bridge
is
past
;
and
as
Turpin
rode
through
the
deserted
streets
of
Huntingdon
,
he
heard
the
eleventh
hour
given
from
the
iron
tongue
of
St.
Mary
's
spire
.
<EOS>
In
four
hours
—
it
was
about
seven
when
he
started
—
Dick
had
accomplished
full
sixty
miles!A
few
reeling
topers
in
the
streets
saw
the
horseman
flit
past
,
and
one
or
two
windows
were
thrown
open
;
but
Peeping
Tom
of
Coventry
would
have
had
small
chance
of
beholding
the
unveiled
beauties
of
Queen
Godiva
<EOS>
had
she
ridden
at
the
rate
of
Dick
Turpin
.
<EOS>
He
was
gone
,
like
a
meteor
,
almost
as
soon
as
he
appeared
.
<EOS>
Huntingdon
is
left
behind
,
and
he
is
once
more
surrounded
by
dew
-
gemmed
hedges
and
silent
slumbering
trees
.
<EOS>
Broad
meadows
,
or
pasture
land
,
with
drowsy
cattle
,
or
low
bleating
sheep
,
lie
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
But
what
to
Turpin
,
at
that
moment
,
is
nature
,
animate
or
inanimate
?
<EOS>
He
thinks
only
of
his
mare
—
his
future
fame
.
<EOS>
None
are
by
to
see
him
ride
;
no
stimulating
plaudits
ring
in
his
ears
;
no
thousand
hands
are
clapping
;
no
thousand
voices
huzzaing
;
no
handkerchiefs
are
waved
;
no
necks
strained
;
no
bright
eyes
rain
influence
upon
him
;
no
eagle
orbs
watch
his
motions
;
no
bells
are
rung
;
no
cup
awaits
his
achievement
;
no
sweepstakes
—
no
plate
.
<EOS>
But
his
will
be
renown
—
everlasting
renown
;
his
will
be
fame
which
will
not
die
with
him
—
which
will
keep
his
reputation
,
albeit
a
tarnished
one
,
still
in
the
mouths
of
men
.
<EOS>
He
wants
all
these
adventitious
excitements
,
but
he
has
that
within
which
is
a
greater
excitement
than
all
these
.
<EOS>
He
is
conscious
that
he
is
doing
a
deed
to
live
by
.
<EOS>
If
not
riding
for
life
,
he
is
riding
for
immortality
;
and
as
the
hero
may
perchance
feel
—
for
even
a
highwayman
may
feel
like
a
hero,—when
<EOS>
he
willingly
throws
away
his
existence
in
the
hope
of
earning
a
glorious
name
,
Turpin
cared
not
what
might
befall
himself
,
so
he
could
proudly
signalize
himself
as
the
first
of
his
land
,
And
witch
the
world
with
noble
horsemanship!What
need
<EOS>
had
he
of
spectators
?
<EOS>
The
eye
of
posterity
was
upon
him
;
he
felt
the
influence
of
that
Argus
glance
which
has
made
many
a
poor
wight
spur
on
his
Pegasus
with
not
half
so
good
a
chance
of
reaching
the
goal
as
Dick
Turpin
.
<EOS>
Multitudes
,
yet
unborn
,
he
knew
would
hear
and
laud
his
deeds
.
<EOS>
He
trembled
with
excitement
,
and
Bess
trembled
under
him
.
<EOS>
But
the
emotion
was
transient
.
<EOS>
On
,
on
they
fly
!
<EOS>
The
torrent
leaping
from
the
crag
—
the
bolt
from
the
bow
—
the
air
-
cleaving
eagle
—
thoughts
themselves
are
scarce
more
winged
in
their
flight!CHAPTER

<EOS>
THE
night
had
hitherto
been
balmy
and
beautiful
,
with
a
bright
array
of
stars
,
and
a
golden
harvest
moon
,
which
seemed
to
diffuse
even
warmth
with
its
radiance
;
but
now
Turpin
was
approaching
the
region
of
fog
and
fen
,
and
he
began
to
feel
the
influence
of
that
dank
atmosphere
.
<EOS>
The
intersecting
dykes
,
yawners
,
gullies
,
or
whatever
they
are
called
,
began
to
send
forth
their
steaming
vapors
,
and
chilled
the
soft
and
wholesome
air
,
obscuring
the
void
,
and
in
some
instances
,
as
it
were
,
choking
up
the
road
itself
with
vapor
.
<EOS>
But
fog
or
fen
was
the
same
to
Bess
;
her
hoofs
rattled
merrily
along
the
road
,
and
she
burst
from
a
cloud
,
like
Eöus
at
the
break
of
dawn
.
<EOS>
It
chanced
,
as
he
issued
from
a
fog
of
this
kind
,
that
Turpin
burst
upon
the
York
stage
coach
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
the
coach
to
be
stopped
;
and
so
furious
was
the
career
of
our
highwayman
,
that
the
man
involuntarily
drew
up
his
horses
.
<EOS>
Turpin
had
also
to
draw
in
the
rein
,
a
task
of
no
little
difficulty
,
as
charging
a
huge
,
lumbering
coach
,
with
its
full
complement
of
passengers
,
was
more
than
even
Bess
could
accomplish
.
<EOS>
The
moon
shone
brightly
on
Turpin
and
his
mare
.
<EOS>
He
was
unmasked
,
and
his
features
were
distinctly
visible
.
<EOS>
An
exclamation
was
uttered
by
a
gentleman
on
the
box
,
who
,
it
appeared
,
instantly
recognized
him
.
<EOS>
"Pull
up
—
draw
your
horses
across
the
road
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
gentleman
;
"
that
's
Dick
Turpin
,
the
highwayman
.
<EOS>
His
capture
would
be
worth
three
hundred
pounds
to
you
,
"
added
he
,
addressing
the
coachman
,
"
and
is
of
equal
importance
to
me
.
<EOS>
Stand
!
"
<EOS>
shouted
he
,
presenting
a
cocked
pistol
.
<EOS>
This
resolution
of
the
gentleman
was
not
apparently
agreeable
,
either
to
the
coachman
or
the
majority
of
the
passengers
—
the
name
of
Turpin
acting
like
magic
upon
them
.
<EOS>
One
man
jumped
off
behind
,
and
was
with
difficulty
afterwards
recovered
,
having
tumbled
into
a
deep
ditch
at
the
roadside
.
<EOS>
An
old
gentleman
with
a
cotton
nightcap
,
who
had
popped
out
his
head
to
swear
at
the
coachman
,
drew
it
suddenly
back
.
<EOS>
A
faint
scream
in
a
female
key
issued
from
within
,
and
there
was
a
considerable
hubbub
on
the
roof
.
<EOS>
Amongst
other
ominous
sounds
,
the
guard
was
heard
to
click
his
long
horse
-
pistols
.
"
<EOS>
Stop
the
York
four
-
day
stage
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
forcing
his
smoky
voice
through
a
world
of
throat
-
embracing
shawl
;
"
the
fastest
coach
in
the
kingdom
:
vos
ever
such
atrocity
heard
of
?
<EOS>
I
say
,
Joe
,
keep
them
ere
leaders
steady
;
we
shall
all
be
in
the
ditch
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
where
the
hind
wheels
are
?
<EOS>
Who
<EOS>
—
whoop
<EOS>
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
gentleman
on
the
box
now
discharged
his
pistol
,
and
the
confusion
within
was
redoubled
.
<EOS>
The
white
nightcap
was
popped
out
like
a
rabbit
's
head
,
and
as
quickly
popped
back
on
hearing
the
highwayman
's
voice
.
<EOS>
Owing
to
the
plunging
of
the
horses
,
the
gentleman
had
missed
his
aim
.
<EOS>
Prepared
for
such
emergencies
as
the
present
,
and
seldom
at
any
time
taken
aback
,
Dick
received
the
fire
without
flinching
.
<EOS>
He
then
lashed
the
horses
out
of
his
course
,
and
rode
up
,
pistol
in
hand
,
to
the
gentleman
who
had
fired
.
<EOS>
"Major
<EOS>
Mowbray
,
"
said
he
,
in
a
stern
tone
,
"
I
know
you
.
<EOS>
I
meant
not
either
to
assault
you
or
these
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
Yet
you
have
attempted
my
life
,
sir
,
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
now
in
my
power
,
and
by
hell
!
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
answer
the
questions
I
put
to
you
,
nothing
earthly
shall
save
you
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
you
ask
aught
I
may
not
answer
,
fire
!
"
said
the
major
;
"
I
will
never
ask
life
from
such
as
you
.
<EOS>
""Have
<EOS>
you
seen
aught
of
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
?
"
asked
Dick
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
villain
<EOS>
you
mean
is
not
yet
secured
,
"
replied
the
major
,
"
but
we
have
traces
of
him
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
with
a
view
of
procuring
more
efficient
assistance
that
I
ride
to
town
.
<EOS>
""They
have
not
met
then
,
since
?
"
said
Dick
,
carelessly
.
<EOS>
"Met
!
<EOS>
whom
<EOS>
do
you
mean?""Your
sister
and
Sir
Luke
,
"
said
Dick
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
sister
meet
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
major
,
angrily—"think
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
he
dares
show
himself
at
Rookwood?""Ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
"
laughed
Dick—"she
is
at
Rookwood
,
then
?
<EOS>
A
thousand
thanks
,
major
.
<EOS>
Good
night
to
you
,
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
""Take
that
<EOS>
with
you
,
and
remember
the
guard
,
"
cried
the
fellow
,
who
,
unable
to
take
aim
from
where
he
sat
,
had
crept
along
the
coach
roof
,
and
discharged
thence
one
of
his
large
horse
-
pistols
at
what
he
took
to
be
the
highwayman
's
head
,
but
which
,
luckily
for
Dick
,
was
his
hat
,
which
he
had
raised
to
salute
the
passengers
.
<EOS>
"Remember
<EOS>
you
,
"
said
Dick
,
coolly
replacing
his
perforated
beaver
on
his
brow
;
"
you
may
rely
upon
it
,
my
fine
fellow
,
I
'll
not
forget
you
the
next
time
we
meet
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
off
he
went
like
the
breath
of
the
whirlwind
.

WE
will
now
make
inquiries
after
Mr.
Coates
and
his
party
,
of
whom
both
we
and
Dick
Turpin
have
for
some
time
lost
sight
.
<EOS>
With
unabated
ardor
the
vindictive
man
of
law
and
his
myrmidons
pressed
forward
.
<EOS>
A
tacit
compact
seemed
to
have
been
entered
into
between
the
highwayman
and
his
pursuers
,
that
he
was
to
fly
while
they
were
to
follow
.
<EOS>
Like
bloodhounds
,
they
kept
steadily
upon
his
trail
;
nor
were
they
so
far
behind
as
Dick
imagined
.
<EOS>
At
each
post
-
house
they
passed
they
obtained
fresh
horses
,
and
,
while
these
were
saddling
,
a
postboy
was
despatched
en
courrier
to
order
relays
at
the
next
station
.
<EOS>
In
this
manner
they
proceeded
after
the
first
stoppage
without
interruption
.
<EOS>
Horses
were
in
waiting
for
them
,
as
they
,
"
bloody
with
spurring
,
fiery
hot
with
haste
,
"
and
their
jaded
hacks
arrived
.
<EOS>
Turpin
had
been
heard
or
seen
in
all
quarters
.
<EOS>
Turnpike
-
men
,
waggoners
,
carters
,
trampers
,
all
had
seen

<EOS>
Besides
,
strange
as
it
may
sound
,
they
placed
some
faith
in
his
word
.
<EOS>
York
they
believed
would
be
his
destination
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
coach
which
Dick
had
encountered
hove
in
sight
.
<EOS>
There
was
another
stoppage
and
another
hubbub
.
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
's
nightcap
was
again
manifested
,
and
suffered
a
sudden
occultation
,
as
upon
the
former
occasion
.
<EOS>
The
postboy
,
who
was
in
advance
,
had
halted
,
and
given
up
his
horse
to
Major
Mowbray
,
who
exchanged
his
seat
on
the
box
for
one
on
the
saddle
,
deeming
it
more
expedient
,
after
his
interview
with
Turpin
,
to
return
to
Rookwood
,
rather
than
to
proceed
to
town
.
<EOS>
The
postboy
was
placed
behind
Coates
,
as
being
the
lightest
weight
;
and
,
thus
reinforced
,
the
party
pushed
forward
as
rapidly
as
heretofore
.
<EOS>
Eighty
and
odd
miles
had
now
been
traversed
—
the
boundary
of
another
county
,
Northampton
,
passed
;
yet
no
rest
nor
respite
had
Dick
Turpin
or
his
unflinching
mare
enjoyed
.
<EOS>
But
here
he
deemed
it
fitting
to
make
a
brief
halt
.
<EOS>
Bordering
the
beautiful
domains
of
Burleigh
House
stood
a
little
retired
hostelry
of
some
antiquity
,
which
bore
the
great
Lord
Treasurer
's
arms
.
<EOS>
With
this
house
<EOS>
Dick
was
not
altogether
unacquainted
.
<EOS>
The
lad
who
acted
as
ostler
was
known
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
midnight
,
but
a
bright
and
beaming
night
.
<EOS>
To
the
door
of
the
stable
then
did
he
ride
,
and
knocked
in
a
peculiar
manner
.
<EOS>
Reconnoitering
Dick
through
a
broken
pane
of
glass
in
the
lintel
,
and
apparently
satisfied
with
his
scrutiny
,
the
lad
thrust
forth
a
head
of
hair
as
full
of
straw
as
Mad
Tom
's
is
represented
to
be
upon
the
stage
.
<EOS>
A
chuckle
of
welcome
followed
his
sleepy
salutation
.
<EOS>
"
Glad
to
see
you
,
Captain
Turpin
,
"
said
he
;
"
can
I
do
anything
for
you?""Get
me
<EOS>
a
couple
of
bottles
of
brandy
and
a
beefsteak
,
"
said
Dick
.
<EOS>
"As
to
the
brandy
,
you
can
have
that
in
a
jiffy
—
but
the
steak
,
Lord
love
you
,
the
old
ooman
wo
n't
stand
it
at
this
time
;
but
there
's
a
cold
round
,
mayhap
<EOS>
a
slice
of
that
might
do
—
or
a
knuckle
of
ham?""A
pest
on
your
knuckles
,
Ralph
,
"
cried
Dick
;
"
have
you
any
raw
meat
in
the
house?""Raw
meat
!
"
echoed
Ralph
,
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
,
there
's
a
rare
rump
of
beef
.
<EOS>
You
can
have
a
cut
off
that
,
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
""That
's
the
thing
I
want
,
"
said
Dick
,
ungirthing
his
mare
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Give
me
the
scraper
.
<EOS>
There
,
I
can
get
a
whisp
of
straw
from
your
head
.
<EOS>
Now
run
and
get
the
brandy
.
<EOS>
Better
bring
three
bottles
.
<EOS>
Uncork
'em
,
and
let
me
have
half
a
pail
of
water
to
mix
with
the
spirit
.
<EOS>
""A
<EOS>
pail
full
of
brandy
and
water
to
wash
down
a
raw
steak
!
<EOS>
My
eyes
!
"
exclaimed
Ralph
,
opening
wide
his
sleepy
peepers
;
adding
,
as
he
went
about
the
execution
of
his
task
,
"
I
always
thought
them
Rum
-
padders
,
as
they
call
themselves
,
rum
fellows
,
but
now
I
'm
sartin
sure
on
it
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
most
sedulous
groom
could
not
have
bestowed
more
attention
upon
the
horse
of
his
heart
than
Dick
Turpin
now
paid
to
his
mare
.
<EOS>
He
scraped
,
chafed
,
and
dried
her
,
sounded
each
muscle
,
traced
each
sinew
,
pulled
her
ears
,
examined
the
state
of
her
feet
,
and
,
ascertaining
that
her
"
withers
were
un
-
wrung
,
"
finally
washed
her
from
head
to
foot
in
the
diluted
spirit
,
not
,
however
,
before
he
had
conveyed
a
thimbleful
of
the
liquid
to
his
own
parched
throat
,
and
replenished
what
Falstaff
calls
a
"
pocket
-
pistol
,
"
which
he
had
about
him
.
<EOS>
While
Ralph
was
engaged
in
rubbing
her
down
after
her
bath
,
Dick
occupied
himself
,
not
in
dressing
the
raw
steak
in
the
manner
the
stable
-
boy
had
anticipated
,
but
in
rolling
it
round
the
bit
of
his
bridle
.
<EOS>
"She
will
now
go
as
long
as
there
's
breath
in
her
body
,
"
said
he
,
putting
the
flesh
-
covered
iron
within
her
mouth
.
<EOS>
The
saddle
being
once
more
replaced
,
after
champing
a
moment
or
two
at
the
bit
,
Bess
began
to
snort
and
paw
the
earth
,
as
if
impatient
of
delay
;
and
,
acquainted
as
he
was
with
her
indomitable
spirit
and
power
,
her
condition
was
a
surprise
even
to
Dick
himself
.
<EOS>
Her
vigor
seemed
inexhaustible
,
her
vivacity
was
not
a
whit
diminished
,
but
,
as
she
was
led
into
the
open
space
,
her
step
became
as
light
and
free
as
when
she
started
on
her
ride
,
and
her
sense
of
sound
as
quick
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
she
pricked
her
ears
,
and
uttered
a
low
neigh
.
<EOS>
A
dull
tramp
was
audible
.
<EOS>
"Ha
<EOS>
!
"
exclaimed
Dick
,
springing
into
his
saddle
;
"
they
come
.
<EOS>
""Who
come
,
captain
?
"
asked
Ralph
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
road
takes
a
turn
here
,
do
n't
it
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Dick—"sweeps
round
to
the
right
by
the
plantations
in
the
hollow?""Ay
,
ay
,
captain
,
"
answered
Ralph
;
<EOS>
"
it
's
plain
you
knows
the
ground
.
<EOS>
""What
lies
behind
yon
shed?""A
stiff
fence
,
captain
—
a
reg'lar
rasper
.
<EOS>
Beyond
that
a
hill
-
side
steep
as
a
house
,
no
oss
as
was
ever
shoed
can
go
down
it
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
!
"
laughed
Dick
.
<EOS>
A
loud
halloo
from
Major
Mowbray
,
who
seemed
advancing
upon
the
wings
of
the
wind
,
told
Dick
that
he
was
discovered
.
<EOS>
The
major
was
a
superb
horseman
,
and
took
the
lead
of
his
party
.
<EOS>
Striking
his
spurs
deeply
into
his
horse
,
and
giving
him
bridle
enough
,
the
major
seemed
to
shoot
forward
like
a
shell
through
the
air
.
<EOS>
The
Burleigh
Arms
retired
some
hundred
yards
from
the
road
,
the
space
in
front
being
occupied
by
a
neat
garden
,
with
low
,
clipped
edges
.
<EOS>
No
tall
timber
intervened
between
Dick
and
his
pursuers
,
so
that
the
motions
of
both
parties
were
visible
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Dick
saw
in
an
instant
that
if
he
now
started
he
should
come
into
collision
with
the
major
exactly
at
the
angle
of
the
road
,
and
he
was
by
no
means
desirous
of
hazarding
such
a
rencontre
.
<EOS>
He
looked
wistfully
back
at
the
double
fence
.
<EOS>
"Come
into
the
stable
.
<EOS>
Quick
,
captain
,
quick
!
"
exclaimed
Ralph
.
<EOS>
"The
stable
!
"
echoed
Dick
,
hesitating
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
the
stable
;
it
's
your
only
chance
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
he
's
turning
the
corner
,
and
they
are
all
coming
?
<EOS>
Quick
,
sir
,
quick!"Dick
,
lowering
his
head
,
rode
into
the
tenement
,
the
door
of
which
was
unceremoniously
slapped
in
the
major
's
face
,
and
bolted
on
the
other
side
.
"Villain
!
"
cried
Major
Mowbray
,
thundering
at
the
door
,
"
come
forth
!
<EOS>
You
are
now
fairly
trapped
at
last
—
<EOS>
caught
like
the
woodcock
in
your
own
springe
.
<EOS>
We
have
you
.
<EOS>
Open
the
door
,
I
say
,
and
save
us
the
trouble
of
forcing
it
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
escape
us
.
<EOS>
We
will
burn
the
building
down
but
we
will
have
you
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
dun
<EOS>
you
want
,
measter
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Ralph
,
from
the
lintel
,
whence
he
reconnoitered
the
major
,
and
kept
the
door
fast
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
clean
mista'en
.
<EOS>
There
be
none
here
.
<EOS>
""We'll
soon
see
that
,
"
said
Paterson
,
who
had
now
arrived
;
and
,
<EOS>
leaping
from
his
horse
,
the
chief
constable
took
a
short
run
to
give
himself
impetus
,
and
with
his
foot
burst
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
This
being
accomplished
,
in
dashed
the
major
and
Paterson
,
but
the
stable
was
vacant
.
<EOS>
A
door
was
open
at
the
back
;
they
rushed
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
sharply
sloping
sides
of
a
hill
slipped
abruptly
downwards
,
within
a
yard
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
perilous
descent
to
the
horseman
,
yet
the
print
of
a
horse
's
heels
were
visible
in
the
dislodged
turf
and
scattered
soil
.
<EOS>
"Confusion
!
"
cried
the
major
,
"
he
has
escaped
us
.
<EOS>
""He
is
yonder
,
"
said
Paterson
,
pointing
out
Turpin
moving
swiftly
through
the
steaming
meadow
.
<EOS>
"
See
,
he
makes
again
for
the
road
—
he
clears
the
fence
.
<EOS>
A
regular
throw
he
has
given
us
,
by
the
Lord!""Nobly
done
,
by
Heaven
!
"
cried
the
major
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
all
his
faults
,
I
honor
the
fellow
's
courage
and
admire
his
prowess
.
<EOS>
He
's
already
ridden
to
-
night
as
I
believe
never
man
rode
before
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
ventured
to
slide
down
that
wall
,
for
it
's
nothing
else
,
with
the
enemy
at
my
heels
.
<EOS>
What
say
you
,
gentlemen
,
have
you
had
enough
?
<EOS>
Shall
we
let
him
go
,
or——?""As
far
as
chase
goes
,
I
do
n't
care
if
we
bring
the
matter
to
a
conclusion
,
"
said
Titus
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
,
as
it
is
,
that
I
shall
have
a
sate
to
sit
on
this
week
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
've
lost
leather
most
confoundedly
.
<EOS>
""What
says
Mr.
Coates
?
"
asked
Paterson
.
<EOS>
"
I
look
to
him
.
<EOS>
""Then
mount
,
and
off
,
"
cried
Coates
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Public
duty
requires
that
we
should
take
him
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
private
pique
,
"
returned
the
major
.
"
<EOS>
No
matter
!
<EOS>
The
end
is
the
same
.
<EOS>
Justice
shall
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
To
your
steeds
,
my
merry
men
all
.
<EOS>
Hark
,
and
away
.
<EOS>
"Once
<EOS>
more
upon
the
move
,
Titus
forgot
his
distress
,
and
addressed
himself
to
the
attorney
,
by
whose
side
he
rode
.
<EOS>
"What
place
is
that
we
're
coming
to
?
"
<EOS>
asked
he
,
pointing
to
a
cluster
of
moonlit
spires
belonging
to
a
town
they
were
rapidly
approaching
.
<EOS>
"Stamford
,
"
replied
Coates
.
"Stamford
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Titus
;
"
by
the
powers
!
<EOS>
then
we
've
ridden
a
matter
of
ninety
miles
.
<EOS>
Why
,
the
great
deeds
of
Redmond
O'Hanlon
were
nothing
to
this
!
<EOS>
I
'll
remember
it
to
my
dying
day
,
and
with
reason
,
"
added
he
,
uneasily
shifting
his
position
on
the
saddle
.

<EOS>
DICK
TURPIN
,
meanwhile
,
held
bravely
on
his
course
.
<EOS>
Bess
was
neither
strained
by
her
gliding
passage
down
the
slippery
hill
-
side
nor
shaken
by
larking
the
fence
in
the
meadow
.
<EOS>
As
Dick
said
,
"
It
took
a
devilish
deal
to
take
it
out
of
her
.
"
<EOS>
On
regaining
the
high
road
she
resumed
her
old
pace
,
and
once
more
they
were
distancing
Time
's
swift
chariot
in
its
whirling
passage
<EOS>
o'er
the
earth
.
<EOS>
Stamford
,
and
the
tongue
of
Lincoln
's
fenny
shire
,
upon
which
it
is
situated
,
were
passed
almost
in
a
breath
.
<EOS>
Rutland
is
won
and
passed
,
and
Lincolnshire
once
more
entered
.
<EOS>
The
road
now
verged
within
a
bowshot
of
that
sporting
Athens
—
Corinth
,
perhaps
,
we
should
say
—
Melton
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
Melton
was
then
unknown
to
fame
,
but
,
as
if
inspired
by
that
furor
venaticus
which
now
inspires
all
who
come
within
twenty
miles
of
this
Charybdis
of
the
chase
,
Bess
here
let
out
in
a
style
with
which
it
would
have
puzzled
the
best
Leicestershire
squire
's
best
prad
to
have
kept
pace
.
<EOS>
The
spirit
she
imbibed
through
the
pores
of
her
skin
,
and
the
juices
of
the
meat
she
had
champed
,
seemed
to
have
communicated
preternatural
excitement
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
pace
was
absolutely
terrific
.
<EOS>
Her
eyeballs
were
dilated
,
and
glowed
like
flaming
carbuncles
;
while
her
widely
-
distended
nostril
seemed
,
in
the
cold
moonshine
,
to
snort
forth
smoke
,
as
from
a
hidden
fire
.
<EOS>
Fain
would
Turpin
have
controlled
her
;
but
,
without
bringing
into
play
all
his
tremendous
nerve
,
no
check
could
be
given
her
headlong
course
,
and
for
once
,
and
<EOS>
the
only
time
in
her
submissive
career
,
Bess
resolved
to
have
her
own
way
—
and
she
had
it
.
<EOS>
Like
a
sensible
fellow
,
Dick
conceded
the
point
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
even
of
conjugal
philosophy
in
his
self
-
communion
upon
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
E'en
let
her
take
her
own
way
and
be
hanged
to
her
,
for
an
obstinate
,
self
-
willed
jade
as
she
is
,
"
said
he
:
"
now
her
back
is
up
there
'll
be
no
stopping
her
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
:
she
rattles
away
like
a
woman
's
tongue
,
and
when
that
once
begins
,
we
all
know
what
chance
the
curb
has
.
<EOS>
Best
to
let
her
have
it
out
,
or
rather
to
lend
her
a
lift
.
'
<EOS>
Twill
be
over
the
sooner
.
<EOS>
Tantivy
,
lass
!
<EOS>
tantivy
!
<EOS>
I
know
which
of
us
will
tire
first
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
have
before
said
that
the
vehement
excitement
of
continued
swift
riding
produces
a
paroxysm
in
the
sensorium
amounting
to
delirium
.
<EOS>
Dick
's
blood
was
again
on
fire
.
<EOS>
He
was
first
giddy
,
as
after
a
deep
draught
of
kindling
spirit
;
this
passed
off
,
but
the
spirit
was
still
in
his
veins
—
the
estro
was
working
in
his
brain
.
<EOS>
All
his
ardor
,
his
eagerness
,
his
fury
,
returned
.
<EOS>
He
rode
like
one
insane
,
and
his
courser
partook
of
his
frenzy
.
<EOS>
She
bounded
;
she
leaped
;
she
tore
up
the
ground
beneath
her
;
while
Dick
gave
vent
to
his
exultation
in
one
wild
,
prolonged
halloo
.
<EOS>
More
than
half
his
race
is
run
.
<EOS>
He
has
triumphed
over
every
difficulty
.
<EOS>
He
will
have
no
further
occasion
to
halt
.
<EOS>
Bess
carries
her
forage
along
with
her
.
<EOS>
The
course
is
straightforward
—
success
seems
certain
—
the
goal

<EOS>
AS
the
eddying
currents
sweep
over
its
plains
in
howling
,
bleak
December
,
<EOS>
the
horse
and
her
rider
passed
over
what
remained
of
Lincolnshire
.
<EOS>
Grantham
is
gone
,
and
they
are
now
more
slowly
looking
up
the
ascent
of
Gonerby
Hill
,
a
path
well
known
to
Turpin
;
<EOS>
where
often
,
in
bygone
nights
,
many
a
purse
had
changed
its
owner
.
<EOS>
With
that
feeling
of
independence
and
exhilaration
which
every
one
feels
,
we
believe
,
on
having
climbed
the
hill
-
side
,
Turpin
turned
to
gaze
around
.
<EOS>
There
was
triumph
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
But
the
triumph
was
checked
as
his
glance
fell
upon
a
gibbet
near
him
to
the
right
,
on
the
round
point
of
hill
which
is
a
landmark
to
the
wide
vale
of
Belvoir
.
<EOS>
Pressed
as
he
was
for
time
,
Dick
immediately
struck
out
of
the
road
,
and
approached
the
spot
where
it
stood
.
<EOS>
Two
scarecrow
objects
,
covered
with
rags
and
rusty
links
of
chains
,
depended
from
the
tree
.
<EOS>
A
night
crow
screaming
around
the
carcases
added
to
the
hideous
effect
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Nothing
but
the
living
highwayman
and
his
skeleton
brethren
was
visible
upon
the
solitary
spot
.
<EOS>
Around
him
was
the
lonesome
waste
of
hill
,
o'erlooking
the
moonlit
valley
:
beneath
his
feet
,
a
patch
of
bare
and
lightning
-
blasted
sod
:
above
,
the
wan
,
declining
moon
and
skies
,
flaked
with
ghostly
clouds
;
before
him
,
the
bleached
bodies
of
the
murderers
,
for
such
they
were
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
this
be
my
lot
,
I
marvel
?
"
said
Dick
,
looking
upwards
,
with
an
involuntary
shudder
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
marry
will
it
,
"
rejoined
a
crouching
figure
,
suddenly
springing
from
beside
a
tuft
of
briars
that
skirted
the
blasted
ground
.
<EOS>
Dick
started
in
his
saddle
,
while
Bess
reared
and
plunged
at
the
sight
of
this
unexpected
apparition
.
<EOS>
"What
,
ho
!
<EOS>
thou
devil
's
dam
,
Barbara
,
is
it
thou
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Dick
,
reassured
upon
discovering
it
was
the
gipsy
queen
,
and
no
spectre
whom
he
beheld
.
<EOS>
"
Stand
still
,
Bess
—
stand
,
lass
.
<EOS>
What
dost
thou
here
,
mother
of
darkness
?
<EOS>
Art
gathering
mandrakes
for
thy
poisonous
messes
,
or
pilfering
flesh
from
the
dead
?
<EOS>
Meddle
not
with
their
bones
,
or
I
will
drive
thee
hence
.
<EOS>
What
dost
thou
here
,
I
say
,
old
dam
of
the
gibbet?""I
came
to
die
here
,
"
replied
Barbara
,
in
a
feeble
tone
;
and
,
throwing
back
her
hood
<EOS>
,
she
displayed
features
well
-
nigh
as
ghastly
as
those
of
the
skeletons
above
her
.
"Indeed
,
"
replied
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
made
choice
of
a
pleasant
spot
,
it
must
be
owned
.
<EOS>
But
you
'll
not
die
yet?""Do
<EOS>
you
know
whose
bodies
these
are
?
"
asked
Barbara
,
pointing
upwards
.
<EOS>
"Two
of
your
race
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Dick
;
"
right
brethren
of
the
blade
.
<EOS>
""Two
of
my
sons
<EOS>
,
"
returned
Barbara
;
"
my
twin
children
.
<EOS>
I
am
come
to
lay
my
bones
beneath
their
bones
—
my
sepulchre
shall
be
their
sepulchre
;
my
body
shall
feed
the
fowls
of
the
air
as
theirs
have
fed
them
.
<EOS>
And
if
ghosts
can
walk
,
we
'll
scour
this
heath
together
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
,
Dick
Turpin
,
"
said
the
hag
,
drawing
as
near
to
the
highwayman
as
Bess
would
permit
her
;
"
dead
men
walk
and
ride
—
ay
,
ride!—there
's
a
comfort
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
've
seen
these
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
them
fling
off
their
chains
,
and
dance
—
ay
,
dance
with
me
—
with
their
mother
.
<EOS>
No
revels
like
dead
men
's
revels

Dick
.
<EOS>
I
shall
soon
join
'
em

<EOS>
""You
will
not
lay
violent
hands
upon
yourself
,
mother
?
"
said
Dick
,
with
difficulty
mastering
his
terror
.
<EOS>
"No
,
"
replied
Barbara
,
in
an
altered
tone
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
let
nature
do
her
task
.
<EOS>
Would
she
could
do
it
more
quickly
.
<EOS>
Such
a
life
as
mine
wo
n't
go
out
without
a
long
struggle
.
<EOS>
What
have
I
to
live
for
now
?
<EOS>
All
are
gone
—
she
and
her
child
!
<EOS>
But
what
is
this
to
you
?
<EOS>
You
have
no
child
;
and
if
you
had
,
you
could
not
feel
like
a
father
.
<EOS>
No
matter
—
I
rave
.
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
crawled
hither
to
die
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
five
days
since
I
beheld
you
,
and
during
that
time
food
has
not
passed
these
lips
,
nor
aught
of
moisture
,
save
Heaven
's
dew
,
cooled
this
parched
throat
,
nor
shall
they
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
That
time
can
not
be
far
off
;
and
now
can
you
not
guess
how
I
mean
to
die
?
<EOS>
Begone
and
leave
me
;
your
presence
troubles
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
breathe
my
last
breath
alone
,
with
none
to
witness
the
parting
pang
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
trouble
you
longer
,
mother
,
"
said
Dick
,
turning
his
mare
;
"
nor
will
I
ask
your
blessing
.
<EOS>
""My
blessing
!
"
<EOS>
scornfully
ejaculated
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
it
if
you
will
,
but
you
will
find
it
a
curse
.
<EOS>
Stay
!
<EOS>
a
thought
strikes
me
.
<EOS>
Whither
are
you
going?""To
seek
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
,
"
replied
Dick
.
"
<EOS>
Know
<EOS>
you
aught
of
him?""Sir
Luke
Rookwood
!
<EOS>
You
seek
him
,
and
would
find
him
?
"
screamed
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
would
,
"
said
Dick
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
you
will
find
him
,
"
said
Barbara
;
"
and
that
ere
long
.
<EOS>
I
shall
ne'er
again
behold
him
.
<EOS>
Would
I
could
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
message
for
him
—
one
of
life
and
death
.
<EOS>
Will
you
convey
it
to
him?""I
will
,
"
said
the
highwayman
.
<EOS>
"Swear
by
those
bones
to
do
so
,
"
cried
Barbara
,
pointing
with
her
skinny
fingers
to
the
gibbet
;
"
that
you
will
do
my
bidding
.
<EOS>
""I
swear
,
"
cried
Dick
.
<EOS>
"Fail
<EOS>
not
,
or
we
will
haunt
thee
to
thy
life
's
end
,
"
cried
Barbara
;
adding
,
as
she
handed
a
sealed
package
to
the
highwayman
,
"
Give
this
to
Sir
Luke
—
to
him
alone
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
sent
it
to
him
by
other
hands
ere
this
,
but
my
people
have
deserted
me
—
have
pillaged
my
stores
—
have
rifled
me
of
all
save
this
.
<EOS>
Give
this
,
I
say
,
to
Sir
Luke
,
with
your
own
hands
.
<EOS>
You
have
sworn
it
,
and
will
obey
.
<EOS>
Give
it
to
him
,
and
bid
him
think
of
Sybil
as
he
opens
it
.
<EOS>
But
this
must
not
be
till
Eleanor
is
in
his
power
;
and
she
must
be
present
when
the
seal
is
broken
.
<EOS>
It
relates
to
both
.
<EOS>
Dare
not
to
tamper
with
it
,
or
my
curse
shall
pursue
you
.
<EOS>
That
packet
is
guarded
with
a
triple
spell
,
which
to
you
were
fatal
.
<EOS>
Obey
me
,
and
my
dying
breath
shall
bless
thee
.
<EOS>
""Never
<EOS>
fear
,
"
said
Dick
,
taking
the
packet
<EOS>
;
"
I
'll
not
disappoint
you
,
mother
,
depend
upon
it
.
<EOS>
""Hence
!
"
cried
the
crone
;
and
as
she
watched
Dick
's
figure
lessening
upon
the
Waste
,
and
at
length
beheld
him
finally
disappear
down
the
hill
-
side
,
she
sank
to
the
ground
,
her
frail
strength
being
entirely
exhausted
.
<EOS>
"
Body
and
soul
may
now
part
in
peace
,
"
gasped
she
.
<EOS>
"
All
I
live
for
is
accomplished
.
"
<EOS>
And
ere
one
hour
had
elapsed
,
the
night
crow
was
perched
upon
her
still
breathing
frame
.
<EOS>
Long
pondering
upon
this
singular
interview
,
Dick
pursued
his
way
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
thought
fit
to
examine
the
packet
with
which
the
old
gipsy
had
entrusted
him
.
<EOS>
"It
feels
like
a
casket
,
"
thought
he
.
<EOS>
"
It
ca
n't
be
gold
.
<EOS>
But
then
it
may
be
jewels
,
though
they
do
n't
rattle
,
and
it
ai
n't
quite
heavy
enough
.
<EOS>
What
can
it
be
?
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
know
.
<EOS>
There
is
some
mystery
<EOS>
,
that
's
certain
,
about
it
;
but
I
will
not
break
the
seal
,
not
I.
<EOS>
As
to
her
spell
,
that
I
do
n't
value
a
rush
;
but
I
've
sworn
to
give
it
to
Sir
Luke
,
and
deliver
her
message
,
and
I
'll
keep
my
word
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
He
shall
have
it
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
replaced
it
in
his
pocket
.

<EOS>
Full
forty
miles
shall
we
pass
over
in
a
breath

<EOS>
Two
more
hours
have
elapsed
,
and
he
still
urges
his
headlong
career
,
with
heart
resolute
as
ever
,
and
purpose
yet
unchanged
.
<EOS>
Fair
Newark
,
and
the
dashing
Trent
,
"
most
loved
of
England
's
streams
,
"
are
gathered
to
his
laurels
.
<EOS>
Broad
Notts
,
and
its
heavy
paths
and
sweeping
glades
;
its
waste
—
forest
no
more
—
of
Sherwood
past
;
bold
Robin
Hood
and
his
merry
men
,
his
Marian
and
his
moonlight
rides
,
recalled
,
forgotten
,
left
behind
.
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
<EOS>
hurrah
!
<EOS>
That
wild
halloo
,
that
waving
arm
,
that
enlivening
shout
—
what
means
it
?
<EOS>
He
is
once
more
upon
Yorkshire
ground
;
his
horse
's
hoof
beats
once
more
the
soil
of
that
noble
shire
.
<EOS>
So
transported
was
Dick
,
that
he
could
almost
have
flung
himself
from
the
saddle
to
kiss
the
dust
beneath
his
feet
.
<EOS>
Thrice
fifty
miles
<EOS>
has
he
run
,
nor
has
the
morn
yet
dawned
upon
his
labors
.
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
<EOS>
the
end
draws
nigh
;
the
goal
is
in
view
.
<EOS>
Halloo
!
<EOS>
halloo
!
<EOS>
on!Bawtrey
is
past
.
<EOS>
He
takes
the
lower
road
by
Thorne
and
Selby
.
<EOS>
He
is
skirting
the
waters
of
the
deep
-
channelled
Don
.
<EOS>
Bess
now
began
to
manifest
some
slight
symptoms
of
distress
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
strain
in
the
carriage
of
her
throat
,
a
dulness
in
her
eye
,
a
laxity
in
her
ear
,
and
a
slight
stagger
in
her
gait
,
which
Turpin
noticed
with
apprehension
.
<EOS>
Still
she
went
on
,
though
not
at
the
same
gallant
pace
as
heretofore
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
the
tired
bird
still
battles
with
the
blast
upon
the
ocean
,
as
the
swimmer
still
stems
the
stream
,
though
spent
,
on
went
she
:
nor
did
Turpin
dare
to
check
her
,
fearing
that
,
if
she
stopped
,
she
might
lose
her
force
,
or
,
if
she
fell
,
she
would
rise
no
more
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
that
gray
and
grimly
hour
ere
one
flicker
of
orange
or
rose
<EOS>
has
gemmed
the
east
,
and
when
unwearying
Nature
herself
seems
to
snatch
brief
repose
.
<EOS>
In
the
roar
of
restless
cities
,
this
is
the
only
time
when
their
strife
is
hushed
.
<EOS>
Midnight
is
awake
—
alive
;
the
streets
ring
with
laughter
and
with
rattling
wheels
.
<EOS>
At
the
third
hour
,
a
dead
,
deep
silence
prevails
;
the
loud
-
voiced
streets
grow
dumb
.
<EOS>
They
are
deserted
of
all
,
save
the
few
guardians
of
the
night
and
the
skulking
robber
.
<EOS>
But
even
far
removed
from
the
haunts
of
men
and
hum
of
towns
it
is
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
Nature
's
best
nurse
"
seems
to
weigh
nature
down
,
and
stillness
reigns
throughout
.
<EOS>
Our
feelings
are
,
in
a
great
measure
,
influenced
by
the
hour
.
<EOS>
Exposed
to
the
raw
,
crude
atmosphere
,
which
has
neither
the
nipping
,
wholesome
shrewdness
of
morn
,
nor
the
profound
chillness
of
night
,
the
frame
vainly
struggles
against
the
dull
,
miserable
sensations
engendered
by
the
damps
,
and
at
once
communicates
them
to
the
spirits
.
<EOS>
Hope
forsakes
us
.
<EOS>
We
are
weary
,
exhausted
.
<EOS>
Our
energy
is
dispirited
.
<EOS>
Sleep
does
"
not
weigh
our
eyelids
down
.
<EOS>
"
We
stare
upon
the
vacancy
.
<EOS>
We
conjure
up
a
thousand
restless
,
disheartening
images
.
<EOS>
We
abandon
projects
we
have
formed
,
and
which
,
viewed
through
this
medium
,
appear
fantastical
,
chimerical
,
absurd
.
<EOS>
We
want
rest
,
refreshment
,
energy
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
say
that
Turpin
had
all
these
misgivings
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
to
struggle
hard
with
himself
to
set
sleep
and
exhaustion
at
defiance
.
<EOS>
The
moon
had
set
.
<EOS>
The
stars
,
Pinnacled
deep
in
the
intense
main
,
had
all
—
save
one
,
the
herald
of
the
dawn
—
withdrawn
their
luster
.
<EOS>
A
dull
mist
lay
on
the
stream
,
and
the
air
became
piercing
cold
.
<EOS>
Turpin
's
chilled
fingers
could
scarcely
grasp
the
slackening
rein
,
while
his
eyes
,
irritated
by
the
keen
atmosphere
,
hardly
enabled
him
to
distinguish
surrounding
objects
,
or
even
to
guide
his
steed
.
<EOS>
It
was
owing
,
probably
,
to
this
latter
circumstance
,
that
Bess
suddenly
floundered
and
fell
,
throwing
her
master
over
her
head
.
<EOS>
Turpin
instantly
recovered
himself
.
<EOS>
His
first
thought
was
for
his
horse
.
<EOS>
But
Bess
was
instantly
upon
her
legs
—
covered
with
dust
and
foam
,
sides
and
cheeks
—
and
with
her
large
eyes
glaring
wildly
,
almost
piteously
,
upon
her
master
.
<EOS>
"Art
<EOS>
hurt
,
lass
?
"
asked
Dick
,
as
she
shook
herself
,
and
slightly
shivered
.
<EOS>
And
he
proceeded
to
the
horseman
's
scrutiny
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
but
a
shake
;
though
that
dull
eye
—
those
quivering
flanks
—
—
"
added
he
,
looking
earnestly
at
her
.
"
She
wo
n't
go
much
further
,
and
I
must
give
it
up
—
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
give
up
the
race
just
when
it
's
won
?
<EOS>
No
,
that
ca
n't
be
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
well
thought
on
.
<EOS>
I
've
a
bottle
of
liquid
,
given
me
by
an
old
fellow
,
who
was
a
knowing
cove
and
famous
jockey
in
his
day
,
which
he
swore
would
make
a
horse
go
as
long
as
he
'd
a
leg
to
carry
him
,
and
bade
me
keep
it
for
some
great
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
've
never
used
it
;
but
I
'll
try
it
now
.
<EOS>
It
should
be
in
this
pocket
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Bess
,
wench
<EOS>
,
I
fear
I
'm
using
thee
,
after
all
,
as
Sir
Luke
did
his
mistress
,
that
I
thought
so
like
thee
.
<EOS>
No
matter
!
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
glorious
end
.
<EOS>
"Raising
<EOS>
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
<EOS>
,
Dick
poured
the
contents
of
the
bottle
down
the
throat
of
his
mare
.
<EOS>
Nor
had
he
to
wait
long
before
its
invigorating
effects
were
instantaneous
.
<EOS>
The
fire
was
kindled
in
the
glassy
orb
;
her
crest
was
once
more
erected
;
her
flank
ceased
to
quiver
;
and
she
neighed
loud
and
joyously
.
<EOS>
"Egad
,
the
old
fellow
was
right
,
"
cried
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
The
drink
has
worked
wonders
.
<EOS>
What
the
devil
could
it
have
been
?
<EOS>
It
smells
like
spirit
,
"
added
he
,
examining
the
bottle
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
'd
left
a
taste
for
myself
.
<EOS>
But
here
's
that
will
do
as
well
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
drained
his
flask
of
the
last
drop
of
brandy
.
<EOS>
Dick
's
limbs
were
now
become
so
excessively
stiff
,
that
it
was
with
difficulty
he
could
remount
his
horse
.
<EOS>
But
this
necessary
preliminary
being
achieved
by
the
help
of
a
stile
,
he
found
no
difficulty
in
resuming
his
accustomed
position
upon
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
We
know
not
whether
there
was
any
likeness
between
our
Turpin
and
that
modern
Hercules
of
the
sporting
world
,
Mr.
Osbaldeston
.
<EOS>
Far
be
it
from
us
to
institute
any
comparison
,
though
we
can
not
help
thinking
that
,
in
one
particular
,
he
resembled
that
famous
"
copper
-
bottomed
"
squire
.
<EOS>
This
we
will
leave
to
our
reader
's
discrimination
.
<EOS>
Dick
bore
his
fatigues
wonderfully
.
<EOS>
He
suffered
somewhat
of
that
martyrdom
which
,
according
to
Tom
Moore
,
occurs
"
to
weavers
and
M.
P.
's
,
from
sitting
too
long
;
"
but
again
on
his
courser
's
back
,
he
cared
not
for
anything
.
<EOS>
Once
more
,
at
a
gallant
pace
,
he
traversed
the
banks
of
the
Don
,
skirting
the
fields
of
flax
that
bound
its
sides
,
and
hurried
far
more
swiftly
than
its
current
to
its
confluence
with
the
Aire
.
<EOS>
Snaith
was
past
.
<EOS>
He
was
on
the
road
to
Selby
when
dawn
first
began
to
break
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
a
twitter
was
heard
in
the
hedge
;
a
hare
ran
across
his
path
,
gray
-
looking
as
the
morning
self
;
and
the
mists
began
to
rise
from
the
earth
.
<EOS>
A
bar
of
gold
was
drawn
against
the
east
,
like
the
roof
of
a
gorgeous
palace
.
<EOS>
But
the
mists
were
heavy
in
this
world
of
rivers
and
their
tributary
streams
.
<EOS>
The
Ouse
was
before
him
,
the
Trent
and
Aire
behind
;
the
Don
and
Derwent
on
either
hand
,
all
in
their
way
to
commingle
their
currents
ere
<EOS>
they
formed
the
giant
Humber
.
<EOS>
Amid
a
region
so
prodigal
of
water
,
no
wonder
the
dews
fell
thick
as
rain
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
the
ground
was
clear
;
but
then
again
came
a
volley
of
vapor
,
dim
and
palpable
as
smoke
.
<EOS>
While
involved
in
one
of
these
fogs
,
Turpin
became
aware
of
another
horseman
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
discern
the
features
of
the
rider
,
but
his
figure
in
the
mist
seemed
gigantic
;
neither
was
the
color
of
his
steed
distinguishable
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
visible
except
the
meagre
-
looking
,
phantom
-
like
outline
of
a
horse
and
his
rider
,
and
,
as
the
unknown
rode
upon
the
turf
that
edged
the
way
,
even
the
sound
of
the
horse
's
hoofs
was
scarcely
audible
.
<EOS>
Turpin
gazed
,
not
without
superstitious
awe
.
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
he
essayed
to
address
the
strange
horseman
,
but
his
tongue
clave
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
He
fancied
he
discovered
in
the
mist
-
exaggerated
lineaments
of
the
stranger
a
wild
and
fantastic
resemblance
to
his
friend
Tom
King
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
Tom
,
"
thought
Turpin
;
"
he
is
come
to
warn
me
of
my
approaching
end
.
<EOS>
I
will
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
terror
o'ermastered
his
speech
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
force
out
a
word
,
and
thus
side
by
side
they
rode
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Quaking
with
fears
he
would
scarcely
acknowledge
to
himself
,
Dick
watched
every
motion
of
his
companion
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
,
stern
,
spectre
-
like
,
erect
;
and
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
demon
on
his
phantom
steed
.
<EOS>
His
courser
seemed
,
in
the
indistinct
outline
,
to
be
huge
and
bony
,
and
,
as
he
snorted
furiously
in
the
fog
,
Dick
's
heated
imagination
supplied
his
breath
with
a
due
proportion
of
flame
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
spoken
—
not
a
sound
heard
,
save
the
sullen
dead
beat
of
his
hoofs
upon
the
grass
.
<EOS>
It
was
intolerable
to
ride
thus
cheek
by
jowl
with
a
goblin
.
<EOS>
Dick
could
stand
it
no
longer
.
<EOS>
He
put
spurs
to
his
horse
,
and
endeavored
to
escape
.
<EOS>
But
it
might
not
be
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
,
apparently
without
effort
,
was
still
by
his
side
,
and
Bess
's
feet
,
in
her
master
's
apprehensions
,
were
nailed
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
,
however
,
the
atmosphere
became
clearer
.
<EOS>
Bright
quivering
beams
burst
through
the
vaporous
shroud
,
and
then
it
was
that
Dick
discovered
that
the
apparition
of
Tom
King
was
no
other
than
Luke
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
He
was
mounted
on
his
old
horse
,
Rook
,
and
looked
grim
and
haggard
as
a
ghost
vanishing
at
the
crowing
of
the
cock
.
"Sir
<EOS>
Luke
Rookwood
,
by
this
light
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Dick
,
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
I
took
you
for——""The
devil
,
no
doubt
?
"
returned
Luke
,
smiling
sternly
,
"
and
were
sorry
to
find
yourself
so
hard
pressed
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
disquiet
yourself
;
I
am
still
flesh
and
blood
.
<EOS>
""Had
<EOS>
I
taken
you
for
one
of
mortal
mould
,
"
said
Dick
,
"
you
should
have
soon
seen
where
I
'd
have
put
you
in
the
race
.
<EOS>
That
confounded
fog
deceived
me
,
and
Bess
acted
the
fool
as
well
as
myself
.
<EOS>
However
,
now
I
know
you
,
Sir
Luke
,
you
must
spur
alongside
,
for
the
hawks
are
on
the
wing
;
and
though
I
've
much
to
say
,
I
've
not
a
second
to
lose
.
"
<EOS>
And
Dick
briefly
detailed
the
particulars
of
his
ride
,
concluding
with
his
rencontre
with
Barbara
.
<EOS>
"
Here
's
the
packet
,
"
said
he
,
"
just
as
I
got
it
.
<EOS>
You
must
keep
it
till
the
proper
moment
.
<EOS>
And
here
,
"
added
he
,
fumbling
in
his
pocket
for
another
paper
,
"
is
the
marriage
document
.
<EOS>
You
are
now
your
father
's
lawful
son
,
let
who
will
say
you
nay
.
<EOS>
Take
it
and
welcome
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
ever
master
of
Miss
Mowbray
's
hand
,
you
will
not
forget
Dick
Turpin
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
will
not
,
"
said
Luke
,
eagerly
grasping
the
certificate
;
"
but
she
never
may
be
mine
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
her
oath?""I
have
.
<EOS>
""What
more
is
needed?""Her
hand
.
<EOS>
""That
will
follow
.
<EOS>
""It
shall
follow
,
"
replied
Sir
Luke
,
wildly
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
.
<EOS>
She
is
my
affianced
bride
—
affianced
before
hell
,
if
not
before
heaven
.
<EOS>
I
have
sealed
the
contract
with
blood
—
with
Sybil
's
blood
—
and
it
shall
be
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
I
have
her
oath
—
her
oath
—
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
Though
I
perish
in
the
attempt
,
I
will
wrest
her
from
Ranulph
's
grasp
.
<EOS>
She
shall
never
be
his
.
<EOS>
I
would
stab
her
first
.
<EOS>
Twice
have
I
failed
in
my
endeavors
to
bear
her
off
.
<EOS>
I
am
from
Rookwood
even
now
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
night
I
shall
renew
the
attack
.
<EOS>
Will
you
assist
me?""To
-
morrow
night
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Dick
.
<EOS>
"Nay
,
I
should
say
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
A
new
day
has
already
dawned
,
"
replied
Luke
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
will
:
she
is
at
Rookwood?""She
languishes
there
at
present
,
attended
by
her
mother
and
her
lover
.
<EOS>
The
hall
is
watched
and
guarded
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
is
ever
on
the
alert
.
<EOS>
But
we
will
storm
their
garrison
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
spy
within
its
walls
—
a
gipsy
girl
,
faithful
to
my
interests
.
<EOS>
From
her
I
have
learnt
that
there
is
a
plot
to
we
d
Eleanor
to
Ranulph
,
and
that
the
marriage
is
to
take
place
privately
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
This
must
be
prevented
.
<EOS>
""It
must
.
<EOS>
But
why
not
boldly
appear
in
person
at
the
hall
,
and
claim
her?""Why
not
?
<EOS>
I
am
a
proscribed
felon
.
<EOS>
A
price
is
set
upon
my
head

<EOS>
I
am
hunted
through
the
country
—
driven
to
concealment
,
and
dare
not
show
myself
for
fear
of
capture
.
<EOS>
What
could
I
do
now
?
<EOS>
They
would
load
me
with
fetters
,
bury
me
in
a
dungeon
,
and
we
d
Eleanor
to
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
What
would
my
rights
avail
?
<EOS>
What
would
her
oath
signify
to
them
?
<EOS>
No
;
she
must
be
mine
by
force
.
<EOS>
His

shall
never
be

<EOS>
Again
,
I
ask
you
,
will
you
aid
me?""I
have
said
—
I
will

<EOS>
Where
is
Alan
Rookwood?""Concealed
<EOS>
within
the
hut
on
Thorne
Waste

<EOS>
You
know
it
—
it
was
one
of
your
haunts
.
<EOS>
""I
know
it
well
,
"
said
Dick
,
"
and
Conkey
Jem
,
its
keeper
,
into
the
bargain
:
<EOS>
he
is
a
knowing
file
.
<EOS>
I
'll
join
you
at
the
hut
at
midnight
,
if
all
goes
well
.
<EOS>
We
'll
bring
off
the
wench
,
in
spite
of
them
all
—
just
the
thing
I
like
.
<EOS>
But
in
case
of
a
break
-
down
on
my
part
,
suppose
you
take
charge
of
my
purse
in
the
mean
time
.
<EOS>
"Luke
would
have
declined
this
offer

"Pshaw
!

said
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
Who
knows
what
may
happen
?
<EOS>
and
it
's
not
ill
-
lined
either

<EOS>
You
'll
find
an
odd
hundred
or
so
in
that
silken
bag
—
it
's
not
often
your
highwayman
gives
away
a
purse

<EOS>
Take
it
,
man
—
we'll
settle
all
to
-
night
;
and
if
I
do
n't
come
,
keep
it
—
it
will
help
you
to
your
bride
.
<EOS>
And
now
off
with
you
to
the
hut
,
for
you
are
only
hindering
me
.
<EOS>
Adieu
!
<EOS>
My
love
to
old
Alan

<EOS>
We
'll
do
the
trick
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Away
with
you
to
the
hut
.
<EOS>
Keep
yourself
snug
there
till
midnight
,
and
we
'll
ride
over
to
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
""At
midnight
,
"
replied
Sir
Luke
,
wheeling
off
,
"
I
shall
expect
you
.
<EOS>
""'Ware
<EOS>
hawks
!
"
<EOS>
hallooed
Dick
.
<EOS>
But
Luke
had
vanished
.
<EOS>
In
another
instant
Dick
was
scouring
the
plain
as
rapidly
as
ever
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
as
Dick
has
casually
alluded
to
the
hawks
,
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
inquire
how
they
had
flown
throughout
the
night
,
and
whether
they
were
still
in
chase
of
their
quarry
.
<EOS>
With
the
exception
of
Titus
,
who
was
completely
done
up
at
Grantham
,
"
having
got
,
"
as
he
said
,
"
a
complete
bellyful
of
it
,
"
they
were
still
on
the
wing
,
and
resolved
sooner
or
later
to
pounce
upon
their
prey
,
pursuing
the
same
system
as
heretofore
in
regard
to
the
post
-
horses
.
<EOS>
Major
Mowbray
and
Paterson
took
the
lead
,
but
the
irascible
and
invincible
attorney
was
not
far
in
their
rear
,
his
wrath
having
been
by
no
means
allayed
by
the
fatigue
he
had
undergone
.
<EOS>
At
Bawtrey
they
held
a
council
of
war
for
a
few
minutes
,
being
doubtful
which
course
he
had
taken
.
<EOS>
Their
incertitude
was
relieved
by
a
foot
traveller
,
who
had
heard
Dick
's
loud
halloo
on
passing
the
boundary
of
Nottinghamshire
,
and
had
seen
him
take
the
lower
road
.
<EOS>
They
struck
,
therefore
,
into
the
path
at
Thorne
at
a
hazard
,
and
were
soon
satisfied
they
were
right
.
<EOS>
Furiously
did
they
now
spur
on
.
<EOS>
They
reached
Selby
,
changed
horses
at
the
inn
in
front
of
the
venerable
cathedral
church
,
and
learnt
from
the
postboy
that
a
toilworn
horseman
,
on
a
jaded
steed
,
had
ridden
through
the
town
about
five
minutes
before
them
,
and
could
not
be
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
advance
.
"
<EOS>
His
horse
was
so
dead
beat
,
"
said
the
lad
,
"
that
I
'm
sure
he
can
not
have
got
far
;
<EOS>
and
,
if
you
look
sharp
,
I
'll
be
bound
<EOS>
you
'll
overtake
him
before
he
reaches
Cawood
Ferry
.

"Mr

Coates
was
transported

We
'll
lodge
him
snug
in

cried
he
,
rubbing
his

.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
hope
<EOS>
so

sir

"
said
the
chief
constable
,
"
<EOS>

I
begin
to
have
some
qualms

""Now

come
along

soon

CAWOOD
<EOS>
FERRYThe
sight
renewed
my
courser
's
feet
,
A
moment
,
staggering
feebly
fleet
,
A
moment
,
with
a
faint
low
neigh
,
He
answered
,
and
then
fell
.
<EOS>
With
gasps
and
glazing
eyes
he
lay
,
And
reeking
limbs
<EOS>
immovable,—His
first
,
and
last
career
was
done.—Mazeppa
.
<EOS>
THE
sun
had
just
o'ertopped
the
"
high
eastern
hill
,
"
as
Turpin
reached
the
Ferry
of
Cawood
,
and
his
beams
were
reflected
upon
the
deep
and
sluggish
waters
of
the
Ouse
.
<EOS>
Wearily
had
he
dragged
his
course
thither
—
wearily
and
slow
.
<EOS>
The
powers
of
his
gallant
steed
were
spent
,
and
he
could
scarcely
keep
her
from
sinking
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
midway
'
twixt
the
hours
of
five
and
six
.
<EOS>
Nine
miles
only
lay
before
him
,
and
that
thought
again
revived
him
.
<EOS>
He
reached
the
water
's
edge
,
and
hailed
the
ferryboat
,
which
was
then
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
At
that
instant
a
loud
shout
smote
his
ear
;
it
was
the
halloo
of
his
pursuers
.
<EOS>
Despair
was
in
his
look
.
<EOS>
He
shouted
to
the
boatman
,
and
bade
him
pull
fast
.
<EOS>
The
man
obeyed
;
but
he
had
to
breast
a
strong
stream
,
and
had
a
lazy
bark
and
heavy
sculls
to
contend
with
.
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
left
the
shore
when
,
another
shout
was
raised
from
the
pursuers
.
<EOS>
The
tramp
of
their
steeds
grew
louder
and
louder
.
<EOS>
The
boat
had
scarcely
reached
the
middle
of
the
stream
.
<EOS>
His
captors
were
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Quietly
did
he
walk
down
the
bank
,
and
as
cautiously
enter
the
water
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
plunge
,
and
steed
and
rider
were
swimming
down
the
river
.
<EOS>
Major
Mowbray
was
at
the
brink
of
the
stream
.
<EOS>
He
hesitated
an
instant
,
and
stemmed
the
tide
.
<EOS>
Seized
,
as
it
were
,
by
a
mania
for
equestrian
distinction
,
Mr.
Coates
braved
the
torrent
.
<EOS>
Not
so
Paterson
.
<EOS>
He
very
coolly
took
out
his
bulldogs
,
and
,
watching
Turpin
,
cast
up
in
his
own
mind
the
pros
and
cons
of
shooting
him
as
he
was
crossing
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
certainly
hit
him
,
"
thought
,
or
said
,
the
constable
;
"
but
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
A
dead
highwayman
is
worth
nothing
—
alive
,
he
weighs
300l
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
shoot
him
,
but
I
'll
make
a
pretence
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
fired
accordingly
.
<EOS>
The
shot
skimmed
over
the
water
,
but
did
not
,
as
it
was
intended
,
do
much
mischief
.
<EOS>
It
,
however
,
occasioned
a
mishap
,
which
had
nearly
proved
fatal
to
our
aquatic
attorney
.
<EOS>
Alarmed
at
the
report
of
the
pistol
,
in
the
nervous
agitation
of
the
moment
Coates
drew
in
his
rein
so
tightly
that
his
steed
instantly
sank
.
<EOS>
A
moment
or
two
afterwards
he
rose
,
shaking
his
ears
,
and
floundering
heavily
towards
the
shore
;
and
such
was
the
chilling
effect
of
this
sudden
immersion
,
that
Mr.
Coates
now
thought
much
more
of
saving
himself
than
of
capturing
Turpin
.
<EOS>
Dick
,
meanwhile
,
had
reached
the
opposite
bank
,
and
,
refreshed
by
her
bath
,
Bess
scrambled
up
the
sides
of
the
stream
,
and
speedily
regained
the
road
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
do
it
yet
,
"
shouted
Dick
;
"
that
stream
has
saved
her
.
<EOS>
Hark
away
,
lass
!
<EOS>
Hark
away!"Bess
heard
the
cheering
cry
,
and
she
answered
to
the
call
.
<EOS>
She
roused
all
her
energies
;
strained
every
sinew
,
and
put
forth
all
her
remaining
strength
.
<EOS>
Once
more
,
on
wings
of
swiftness
,
she
bore
him
away
from
his
pursuers
,
and
Major
Mowbray
,
who
had
now
gained
the
shore
,
and
made
certain
of
securing
him
,
beheld
him
spring
,
like
a
wounded
hare
,
from
beneath
his
very
hand
.
<EOS>
"It
can
not
hold
out
,
"
said
the
major
;
"
it
is
but
an
expiring
flash
;
that
gallant
steed
must
soon
drop
.
<EOS>
""She
be
regularly
booked
,
that
's
certain
,
"
said
the
postboy
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
shall
find
her
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
"Contrary
<EOS>
to
all
expectation
,
however
,
Bess
held
on
,
and
set
pursuit
at
defiance
.
<EOS>
Her
pace
was
swift
as
when
she
started
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
unconscious
and
mechanical
action
.
<EOS>
It
wanted
the
ease
,
the
lightness
,
the
life
of
her
former
riding
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
screwed
up
to
a
task
which
she
must
execute
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
flogging
,
no
gory
heel
;
but
the
heart
was
throbbing
,
tugging
at
the
sides
within
.
<EOS>
Her
spirit
spurred
her
onwards
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
was
glazing
;
her
chest
heaving
;
her
flank
quivering
;
her
crest
again
fallen
.
<EOS>
Yet
she
held
on
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
dying
!
"
said
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
it
—
—
"
No
,
she
held
on
.
<EOS>
Fulford
is
past
.
<EOS>
The
towers
and
pinnacles
of
York
burst
upon
him
in
all
the
freshness
,
the
beauty
,
and
the
glory
of
a
bright
,
clear
,
autumnal
morn
.
<EOS>
The
ancient
city
seemed
to
smile
a
welcome
—
a
greeting
.
<EOS>
The
noble
Minster
and
its
serene
and
massive
pinnacles
,
crocketed
,
lantern
-
like
,
and
beautiful
;
St.
Mary
's
lofty
spire
,
All
-
Hallows
Tower
,
<EOS>
the
massive
mouldering
walls
of
the
adjacent
postern
,
the
grim
castle
,
and
Clifford
's
neighboring
keep
—
all
beamed
upon
him
,
like
a
bright
-
eyed
face
,
that
laughs
out
openly
.
<EOS>
"It
is
done
—
it
is
won
,
"
cried
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
hurrah
!
"
<EOS>
And
the
sunny
air
was
cleft
with
his
shouts
.
<EOS>
Bess
was
not
insensible
to
her
master
's
exultation
.
<EOS>
She
neighed
feebly
in
answer
to
his
call
,
and
reeled
forwards
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
piteous
sight
to
see
her,—to
mark
her
staring
,
protruding
eyeball,—her
shaking
flanks
;
but
,
while
life
and
limb
held
together
,
she
held
on
.
<EOS>
Another
mile
is
past
.
<EOS>
York
is
near
.
<EOS>
"Hurrah
!
"
shouted
Dick
;
but
his
voice
was
hushed
.
<EOS>
Bess
tottered
—
fell
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
dreadful
gasp
—
a
parting
moan
—
a
snort
;
her
eye
gazed
,
for
an
instant
,
upon
her
master
,
with
a
dying
glare
;
then
grew
glassy
,
rayless
,
fixed
.
<EOS>
A
shiver
ran
through
her
frame
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
had
burst
.
<EOS>
Dick
's
eyes
were
blinded
,
as
with
rain
.
<EOS>
His
triumph
,
though
achieved
,
was
forgotten
—
his
own
safety
was
disregarded
.
<EOS>
He
stood
weeping
and
swearing
,
like
one
beside
himself
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
art
thou
gone
,
Bess
?
"
<EOS>
cried
he
,
in
a
voice
of
agony
,
lifting
up
his
courser
's
head
,
and
kissing
her
lips
,
covered
with
blood
-
flecked
foam
.
<EOS>
"
Gone
,
gone
!
<EOS>
and
I
have
killed
the
best
steed
that
was
ever
crossed
!
<EOS>
And
for
what
?
"
added
Dick
,
beating
his
brow
with
his
clenched
hand—"for
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
for
what?"At
this
moment
the
deep
bell
of
the
Minster
clock
tolled
out
the
hour
of
six
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
am
answered
,
"
gasped
Dick
;
"
it
was
to
hear
those
strokes
.
<EOS>
"Turpin
was
roused
from
the
state
of
stupefaction
into
which
he
had
fallen
by
a
smart
slap
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Recalled
to
himself
by
the
blow
,
he
started
at
once
to
his
feet
,
while
his
hands
sought
his
pistols
:
but
he
was
spared
the
necessity
of
using
them
,
by
discovering
in
the
intruder
the
bearded
visage
of
the
gipsy
Balthazar
.
<EOS>
The
patrico
was
habited
in
mendicant
weeds
,
and
sustained
a
large
wallet
upon
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
it
's
all
over
with
the
best
mare
in
England
,
I
see
,
"
said
Balthazar
;
"
I
can
guess
how
it
has
happened
—
you
are
pursued?""I
am
,
"
said
Dick
,
roughly
.
<EOS>
"Your
pursuers
are
at
hand?""Within
a
few
hundred
yards
.
<EOS>
""Then
,
why
stay
here
?
<EOS>
Fly
while
you
can
.
<EOS>
""Never
<EOS>
—
never
,
"
cried
Turpin
;
"
I
'll
fight
it
out
here
by
Bess
's
side
.
<EOS>
Poor
lass
!
<EOS>
I
've
killed
her
—
but
she
has
done
it
—
ha
,
ha!—we
have
won
—
what
?
"
<EOS>
And
his
utterance
was
again
choked
.
<EOS>
"Hark
!
<EOS>
I
hear
the
tramp
of
horse
,
and
shouts
,
"
cried
the
patrico
.
<EOS>
"
Take
this
wallet
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
a
change
of
dress
within
it
.
<EOS>
Dart
into
that
thick
copse
—
save
yourself
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
Bess
—
I
can
not
leave
her
,
"
exclaimed
Dick
,
with
an
agonizing
look
at
his
horse
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
what
did
Bess
die
for
,
but
to
save
you
?
"
rejoined
the
patrico
.
<EOS>
"True
,
true
,
"
said
Dick
;
"
but
take
care
of
her
,
do
n't
let
those
dogs
of
hell
meddle
with
her
carcase
.
<EOS>
""Away
,
"
cried
the
patrico
,
"
leave
Bess
to
me
.
<EOS>
"Possessing
<EOS>
himself
of
the
wallet
,
Dick
disappeared
in
the
adjoining
copse
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
gone
many
seconds
when
Major
Mowbray
rode
up
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
Major
,
flinging
himself
from
his
horse
,
and
seizing
the
patrico
;
"
this
is
not
Turpin
.
<EOS>
""Certainly
not
,
"
replied
Balthazar
,
coolly
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
exactly
the
figure
for
a
highwayman
.
<EOS>
""Where
is
he
?
<EOS>
What
has
become
of
him
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Coates
,
in
despair
,
as
he
and
Paterson
joined
the
major
.
<EOS>
"Escaped
<EOS>
,
I
fear
,
"
replied
the
major
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
any
one
,
fellow
?
"
<EOS>
added
he
,
addressing
the
patrico
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
seen
no
one
,
"
replied
Balthazar
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
only
this
instant
arrived
.
<EOS>
This
dead
horse
lying
in
the
road
attracted
my
attention
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Paterson
,
leaping
from
his
steed
,
"
this
may
be
Turpin
after
all
.
<EOS>
He
has
as
many
disguises
as
the
devil
himself
,
and
may
have
carried
that
goat
's
hair
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
Saying
which
,
he
seized
the
patrico
by
the
beard
,
and
shook
it
with
as
little
reverence
as
the
Gaul
handled
the
hirsute
chin
of
the
Roman
senator
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
devil
!
<EOS>
hands
off
,
"
roared
Balthazar
.
<EOS>
"
By
Salamon
,
I
wo
n't
stand
such
usage
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
a
beard
like
mine
is
the
growth
of
a
few
minutes
?
<EOS>
Hands
off
!
<EOS>
I
say
.
<EOS>
""Regularly
done
!
"
<EOS>
said
Paterson
,
removing
his
hold
of
the
patrico
's
chin
,
and
looking
as
blank
as
a
cartridge
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
"
exclaimed
Coates
;
"
all
owing
to
this
worthless
piece
of
carrion
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
not
that
I
hope
to
see
him
dangling
from
those
walls"—pointing
towards
the
Castle—"I
should
wish
her
master
were
by
her
side
now
.
<EOS>
To
the
dogs
with
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
was
about
to
spurn
the
breathless
carcase
of
poor
Bess
,
when
a
sudden
blow
,
dealt
by
the
patrico
's
staff
,
felled
him
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"I'll
teach
you
to
molest
me
,
"
said
Balthazar
,
about
to
attack
Paterson
.
<EOS>
"Come
,
come
<EOS>
,
"
said
the
discomfited
chief
constable
,
"
no
more
of
this
.
<EOS>
It
's
plain
<EOS>
we
're
in
the
wrong
box
.
<EOS>
Every
bone
in
my
body
aches
sufficiently
without
the
aid
of
your
cudgel

old
fellow

<EOS>
Come
,
Mr.
Coates
,
take
my
arm
,
and
let
's
be
moving
.
<EOS>
We
've
had
an
infernal
long
ride
for
nothing

<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
so
,
"
replied
Coates
;
"
I
've
paid
pretty
dearly
for
it
.
<EOS>
However
,
let
us
see
if
we
can
get
any
breakfast
at
the
Bowling

yonder

I
've

had
my

added
the
facetious
man
of
law
,
looking
at
his
dripping
apparel
.
<EOS>
"Poor
Black
Bess
!
"
said
Major
Mowbray
,
wistfully
regarding
the
body
of
the
mare
,
as
it
lay
stretched
at
his
feet

In

proceeded
,
leaving

Black

<EOS>
Major
Mowbray
ordered
a
substantial
repast
to
be
prepared
with
all
possible
expedition
.
<EOS>
A
countryman
,
in
a
smock
-
frock
,
was
busily
engaged
at
his
morning
's
meal
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
see
that
fellow
bolt
down
his
breakfast
,
one
would
think
he
had
fasted
for
a
month
,
"
said
Coates
;
"
see
the
wholesome
effects
of
an
honest
,
industrious
life
,
Paterson
.
<EOS>
I
envy
him
his
appetite
—
I
should
fall
to
with
more
zest
were
Dick
Turpin
in
his
place
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
countryman
looked
up
.
<EOS>
He
was
an
odd
-
looking
fellow
,
with
a
terrible
squint
,
and
a
strange
,
contorted
countenance
.
<EOS>
"An
<EOS>
ugly
dog
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Paterson
:
"
what
a
devil
of
a
twist
he
has
got!""What
's
that
you
says
about
Dick
Taarpin
,
measter
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
countryman
,
with
his
mouth
half
full
of
bread
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
you
seen
aught
of
him
?
"
asked
Coates
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
I
,
"
mumbled
the
rustic
;
"
but
I
hears
aw
<EOS>
the
folks
hereabouts
talk
on
him
.
<EOS>
They
say
as
how
he
sets
all
the
lawyers
and
constables
at
defiance
,
and
laughs
in
his
sleeve
at
their
efforts
to
cotch
him
—
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
He
gets
over
more
ground
in
a
day
than
they
do
in
a
week
—
ho
,
<EOS>
ho!""That
's
all
over
now
,
"
said
Coates
,
peevishly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
cut
his
own
throat
—
ridden
his
famous
mare
to
death
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
countryman
almost
choked
himself
,
in
the
attempt
to
bolt
a
huge
mouthful
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ay
—
indeed
,
measter
!
<EOS>
How
happened
that
?
"
<EOS>
asked
he
,
so
soon
as
he
recovered
speech
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
fool
rode
her
from
London
to
York
last
night
,
"
returned
Coates
;
"
such
a
feat
was
never
performed
before
.
<EOS>
What
horse
could
be
expected
to
live
through
such
work
as
that?""Ah
,
he
were
a
foo
'
to
attempt
that
,
"
observed
the
countryman
;
"
but
you
followed
belike?""We
did
.
<EOS>
""And
took
him
arter
all
,
I
reckon
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
rustic
,
squinting
more
horribly
than
ever
.
<EOS>
"No
,
"
returned
Coates
,
"
I
ca
n't
say
we
did
;
but
we
'll
have
him
yet
.
<EOS>
I
'm
pretty
sure
he
ca
n't
be
far
off

<EOS>
We
may
be
nearer
him
than
we
imagine

<EOS>
""May
be
so
,
measter
,
"
returned
the
countryman
;
"
but
might
I
be
so
bold
as
to
ax
<EOS>
how
many
horses
you
used

the

some
half

dozen

a

<EOS>
growled
Paterson
;
"
we
had
twenty

the

<EOS>
""And

<EOS>
mentally
ejaculated
Turpin
,
for
he
was

<EOS>
THE
hut
on
Thorne
Waste
,
to
which
we
have
before
incidentally
alluded
,
and
whither
we
are
now
about
to
repair
,
was
a
low
,
lone
hovel
,
situate
on
the
banks
of
the
deep
and
oozy
Don
,
at
the
eastern
extremity
of
that
extensive
moor
.
<EOS>
Ostensibly
its
owner
fulfilled
the
duties
of
ferryman
to
that
part
of
the
river
;
but
as
the
road
which
skirted
his
tenement
was
little
frequented
,
his
craft
was
,
for
the
most
part
,
allowed
to
sleep
undisturbed
in
her
moorings
.
<EOS>
In
reality
,
however
,
he
was
the
inland
agent
of
a
horde
of
smugglers
who
infested
the
neighboring
coast
;
his
cabin
was
their
rendezvous
;
and
not
unfrequently
,
it
was
said
,
the
depository
of
their
contraband
goods
.
<EOS>
Conkey
Jem
—
so
was
he
called
by
his
associates
,
on
account
of
the
Slawkenbergian
promontory
which
decorated
his
countenance
—
had
been
an
old
hand
at
the
same
trade
;
but
having
returned
from
a
seven
years
'
leave
of
absence
from
his
own
country
,
procured
by
his
lawless
life
,
now
managed
matters
with
more
circumspection
and
prudence
,
and
had
never
since
been
detected
in
his
former
illicit
traffic
;
nor
,
though
so
marvellously
gifted
in
that
particular
himself
,
was
he
ever
known
to
nose
upon
any
of
his
accomplices
;
or
,
in
other
words
,
to
betray
them
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
his
hut
was
a
sort
of
asylum
for
all
fugitives
from
justice
;
and
although
the
sanctity
of
his
walls
would
,
in
all
probability
,
have
been
little
regarded
,
had
any
one
been
,
detected
within
them
,
yet
,
strange
to
say
,
even
if
a
robber
had
been
tracked
—
as
it
often
chanced
—
to
Jem
's
immediate
neighborhood
,
all
traces
of
him
were
sure
to
be
lost
at
the
ferryman
's
hut
;
and
further
search
was
useless
.
<EOS>
Within
,
the
hut
presented
such
an
appearance
as
might
be
expected
,
from
its
owner
's
pursuits
and
its
own
unpromising
exterior
.
<EOS>
Consisting
of
little
more
than
a
couple
of
rooms
,
the
rude
whitewashed
walls
exhibited
,
in
lieu
of
prints
of
more
pretension
,
a
gallery
of
choicely
-
illustrated
ballads
,
celebrating
the
exploits
of
various
highwaymen
,
renowned
in
song
,
amongst
which
our
friend
Dick
Turpin
figured
conspicuously
upon
his
sable
steed
,
Bess
being
represented
by
a
huge
rampant
black
patch
,
and
Dick
,
with
a
pistol
considerably
longer
than
the
arm
that
sustained
it
.
<EOS>
Next
to
this
curious
collection
was
a
drum
-
net
,
a
fishing
-
rod
,
a
landing
-
net
,
an
eel
-
spear
,
and
other
piscatorial
apparatus
,
with
a
couple
of
sculls
and
a
boat
-
hook
,
indicative
of
Jem
's
ferryman
's
office
,
suspended
by
various
hooks
;
the
whole
blackened
and
begrimed
by
peat
-
smoke
,
there
being
no
legitimate
means
of
exit
permitted
to
the
vapor
generated
by
the
turf
-
covered
hearthstone
.
<EOS>
The
only
window
,
indeed
,
in
the
hut
,
was
to
the
front
;
the
back
apartment
,
which
served
Jem
for
dormitory
,
had
no
aperture
<EOS>
whatever
for
the
admission
of
light
,
except
such
as
was
afforded
through
the
door
of
communication
between
the
rooms
.
<EOS>
A
few
broken
rush
-
bottomed
chairs
,
with
a
couple
of
dirty
tables
,
formed
the
sum
total
of
the
ferryman
's
furniture
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
grotesque
effect
of
his
exaggerated
nasal
organ
,
Jem
's
aspect
was
at
once
savage
and
repulsive
;
his
lank
black
hair
hung
about
his
inflamed
visage
in
wild
elf
locks
,
the
animal
predominating
throughout
;
his
eyes
were
small
,
red
,
and
wolfish
,
and
glared
suspiciously
from
beneath
his
scarred
and
tufted
eyebrows
;
while
certain
of
his
teeth
projected
,
like
the
tusks
of
a
boar
,
from
out
his
coarse
-
lipped
,
sensual
mouth
.
<EOS>
Dwarfish
in
stature
,
and
deformed
in
person
,
Jem
was
built
for
strength
;
and
what
with
his
width
of
shoulder
and
shortness
of
neck
,
his
figure
looked
as
square
and
as
solid
as
a
cube
.
<EOS>
His
throat
and
hirsute
chest
,
constantly
exposed
to
the
weather
,
had
acquired
a
glowing
tan
,
while
his
arms
,
uncovered
to
the
shoulders
,
and
clothed
with
fur
,
like
a
bear
's
hide
,
down
,
almost
,
to
the
tips
of
his
fingers
,
presented
a
knot
of
folded
muscles
,
the
concentrated
force
of
which
few
would
have
desired
to
encounter
in
action
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
on
the
stroke
of
midnight
;
and
Jem
,
who
had
been
lying
extended
upon
the
floor
of
his
hovel
,
suddenly
aroused
by
that
warning
impulse
which
never
fails
to
awaken
one
of
his
calling
at
the
exact
moment
when
they
require
to
be
upon
the
alert
,
now
set
about
fanning
into
flame
the
expiring
fuel
upon
his
hearth
.
<EOS>
Having
succeeded
in
igniting
further
portions
of
the
turf
,
Jem
proceeded
to
examine
the
security
of
his
door
and
window
,
and
satisfied
that
lock
and
bolt
were
shot
,
and
that
the
shutter
was
carefully
closed
,
he
kindled
a
light
at
his
fire
,
and
walked
towards
his
bedroom
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
to
retire
for
the
night
that
the
ferryman
entered
his
dormitory
.
<EOS>
Beside
his
crazy
couch
stood
a
litter
of
empty
bottles
and
a
beer
cask
,
crowding
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
The
latter
he
rolled
aside
,
and
pressing
his
foot
upon
the
plank
beneath
it
,
the
board
gave
way
,
and
a
trap
-
door
opening
,
discovered
a
ladder
,
conducting
,
apparently
,
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
Jem
leaned
over
the
abyss
,
and
called
in
hoarse
accents
to
some
one
below
.
<EOS>
An
answer
was
immediately
returned
,
and
a
light
became
soon
afterwards
visible
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
.
<EOS>
Two
figures
next
ascended
;
the
first
who
set
foot
within
the
ferryman
's
chamber
was
Alan
Rookwood
:
<EOS>
the
other
,
as
the
reader
may
perhaps
conjecture
,
was
his
grandson
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
it
the
hour
?
"
asked
Luke
,
as
he
sprang
from
out
the
trap
-
door
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
"
replied
Jem
,
with
a
coarse
laugh
,
"
or
I
had
not
disturbed
myself
to
call
you
.
<EOS>
But
,
maybe
,
"
added
he
,
softening
his
manner
a
little
,
"
you
'll
like
some
refreshments
before
you
start
?
<EOS>
A
stoup
of
Nantz
will
put
you
in
cue
for
the
job
,
ha
,
ha!""Not
<EOS>
I
,
"
replied
Luke
,
who
could
ill
tolerate
his
companion
's
familiarity
.
<EOS>
"Give
<EOS>
me
to
drink
,
"
said
Alan
,
walking
feebly
towards
the
fire
,
and
extending
his
skinny
fingers
before
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
chilled
by
the
damps
of
that
swampy
cave
—
the
natural
heat
within
me
is
nigh
extinguished
.
<EOS>
""Here
is
that
shall
put
fresh
marrow
into
your
old
bones
,
"
returned
Jem
,
handing
him
a
tumbler
of
brandy
;
"
never
stint
it
.
<EOS>
I
'll
be
sworn
<EOS>
you
'll
be
the
better
on't
,
for
you
look
desperate
queer
,
man
,
about
the
mazard
.
<EOS>
"Alan
was
,
in
sooth
,
a
ghastly
spectacle
.
<EOS>
The
events
of
the
last
few
days
had
wrought
a
fearful
change
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
was
almost
exanimate
;
and
when
,
with
shaking
hand
and
trembling
lips
,
he
had
drained
the
fiery
potion
to
the
dregs
,
a
terrible
grimace
was
excited
upon
his
features
,
such
as
is
produced
upon
the
corpse
by
the
action
of
the
galvanic
machine
.
<EOS>
Even
Jem
regarded
him
with
a
sort
of
apprehension
.
<EOS>
After
he
had
taken
breath
for
a
moment
,
Alan
broke
out
into
a
fit
of
wild
and
immoderate
laughter
.
<EOS>
"Why
,
ay
,
"
said
he
,
"
this
is
indeed
to
grow
young
again
,
and
to
feel
fresh
fire
within
one
's
veins
.
<EOS>
Who
would
have
thought
so
much
of
life
and
energy
could
reside
in
this
little
vessel
?
<EOS>
I
am
myself
once
more
,
and
not
the
same
soulless
,
pulseless
lump
of
clay
<EOS>
I
was
a
moment
or
two
back
.
<EOS>
The
damps
of
that
den
had
destroyed
me
—
and
the
solitude
—
the
waking
dreams
I
've
had
—
the
visions
!
<EOS>
horrible
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
think
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
am
better
now
—
ready
to
execute
my
plans
—
your
plans
I
should
say
,
grandson
Luke
.
<EOS>
Are
our
horses
in
readiness
?
<EOS>
Why
do
we
tarry
?
<EOS>
The
hour
is
arrived
,
and
I
would
not
that
my
new
-
blown
courage
should
evaporate
<EOS>
ere
the
great
work
for
which
I
live
be
accomplished
.
<EOS>
That
done
,
I
ask
no
further
stimulant
.
<EOS>
Let
us
away
.
<EOS>
""We
<EOS>
tarry
but
for
Turpin
,
"
said
Luke
;
"
I
am
as
impatient
as
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
fear
some
mischance
must
have
befallen
him
,
or
he
would
have
been
true
to
his
appointment
.
<EOS>
Do
you
not
think
so
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
addressing
the
ferryman
.
"Why
,
"
replied
Jem
,
reluctantly
,
"
since
you
put
it
home
to
me
,
and
I
ca
n't
conceal
it
no
longer
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
did
n't
tell
afore
,
for
fear
you
should
be
down
in
the
mouth
about
it
.
<EOS>
Dick
Turpin
can
do
nothing
for
you
—
he
's
grabb'd
.
<EOS>
""Turpin
apprehended
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Luke
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
"
returned
Jem
.
<EOS>
"
I
learnt
from
a
farmer
who
crossed
the
ferry
at
nightfall
,
that
he
were
grabb'd
<EOS>
this
morning
at
York
,
after
having
ridden
his
famous
cherry
-
colored
prad
to
death
—
that
's
what
hurts
me
more
not
all
the
rest
;
though
I
fear
Dick
will
scarce
cheat
the
nubbing
cheat
this
go
.
<EOS>
His
time
's
up
,
I
calculate
.
<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
you
supply
his
place
and
accompany
us
?
"
asked
Luke
of
the
ferryman
.
<EOS>
"No
,
no
,
"
replied
Jem
,
shaking
his
head
;
"
there
's
too
much
risk
,
and
too
little
profit
,
in
the
business
for
me
<EOS>
—
it
wo
n't
pay
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
what
might
tempt
you
to
undertake
the
enterprise
?
"
asked
Alan
.
<EOS>
"More
than
you
have
to
offer
,
Master
Peter
,
"
replied
Jem
,
who
had
not
been
enlightened
upon
the
subject
of
Alan
's
real
name
or
condition
.
"How
<EOS>
know
you
that
?
"
demanded
Alan
.
<EOS>
"
Name
your
demand
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
then
,
I
'll
not
say
but
a
hundred
pounds
,
if
you
had
it
,
might
bribe
me——""To
part
with
your
soul
to
the
devil
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
not
,
"
said
Luke
,
fiercely
stamping
the
ground

"
<EOS>
Let
us
be
gone
.
<EOS>
We
need
not
his
mercenary
aid
.
<EOS>
We
will
do
without
him
.
<EOS>
""Stay
,
"
said
Alan
,
"
you
shall
have
the
hundred
,
provided
you
will
assure
us
of
your
services
.
<EOS>
""Cut
<EOS>
no
more
blarneyfied
whids

Master
Sexton

"
replied
Jem
,
in
a
gruff
tone
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
'm
to
go
,
I
must
have
the
chink
down
,
and
that
's
more
nor
either
of
you
can
do
,
I
'm
thinking
.
<EOS>
""Give
me
your
purse
,
"
whispered
Alan
to
his
grandson
.
<EOS>
"
Pshaw
,
"
continued
he
,
"
do
you
hesitate
?
<EOS>
This
man
can
do
much
for
us
.
<EOS>
Think
upon
Eleanor
,
and
be
prudent
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
accomplish
your
task
unaided
.
<EOS>
"
Taking
the
amount
from
the
purse
,
he
gave
it
to
the
ferryman
,
adding
,
"
If
we
succeed
,
the
sum
shall
be
doubled
;
and
now
let
us
set
out
.
<EOS>
"During
<EOS>
Alan
's
speech
,
Jem
's
sharp
eyes
had
been
fastened
upon
the
purse
,
while
he
mechanically
clutched
the
bank
-
notes
which
were
given
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
remove
his
gaze
,
but
continued
staring
at
the
treasure
before
him
,
as
if
he
would
willingly
,
by
force
,
have
made
it
all
his
own
.
<EOS>
Alan
saw
the
error
he
had
committed
in
exposing
the
contents
of
the
purse
to
the
avaricious
ferryman
,
and
was
about
to
restore
it
to
Luke
,
when
the
bag
was
suddenly
snatched
from
his
grasp
,
and
himself
levelled
by
a
blow
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Conkey
Jem
found
the
temptation
irresistible
.
<EOS>
Knowing
himself
to
be
a
match
for
both
his
companions
,
and
imagining
he
was
secure
from
interruption
,
he
conceived
the
idea
of
making
away
with
them
,
and
possessing
himself
of
their
wealth
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
had
he
disposed
of
Alan
,
than
he
assailed
Luke
,
who
met
his
charge
half
way
.
<EOS>
With
the
vigor
and
alacrity
of
the
latter
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
,
but
he
was
no
match
for
the
herculean
strength
of
the
double
-
jointed
ferryman
,
who
,
with
the
ferocity
of
the
boar
he
so
much
resembled
,
thus
furiously
attacked
him
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
as
may
be
imagined
,
he
was
not
disposed
to
yield
up
his
life
tamely
.
<EOS>
He
saw
at
once
the
villain
's
murderous
intentions
,
and
,
well
aware
of
his
prodigious
power
,
would
not
have
risked
a
close
struggle
<EOS>
could
he
have
avoided
it
.
<EOS>
Snatching
the
eel
-
spear
from
the
wall
,
he
had
hurled
it
at
the
head
of
his
adversary
,
but
without
effect
.
<EOS>
In
the
next
instant
he
was
locked
in
a
clasp
terrible
as
that
of
a
Polar
bear
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
all
his
struggles
,
Luke
was
speedily
hurled
to
the
ground
:
and
Jem
,
who
had
thrown
himself
upon
him
,
was
apparently
searching
about
for
some
weapon
to
put
a
bloody
termination
to
the
conflict
,
when
the
trampling
of
a
horse
was
heard
at
the
door
,
three
taps
were
repeated
slowly
,
one
after
the
other
,
and
a
call
resounded
from
a
whistle
.
"Damnation
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Jem
,
gruffly
,
"
interrupted
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
seemed
irresolute
,
slightly
altering
his
position
on
Luke
's
body
.
<EOS>
The
moment
was
fortunate
for
Luke
,
and
,
in
all
probability
,
saved
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
extricated
himself
from
the
ferryman
's
grasp
,
regained
his
feet
,
and
,
what
was
of
more
importance
,
the
weapon
he
had
thrown
away
.
"Villain
!
"
<EOS>
cried
he
,
about
to
plunge
the
spear
with
all
his
force
into
his
enemy
's
side
,
"
you
<EOS>
shall——"The
whistle
was
again
heard
without
.
<EOS>
"Don't
<EOS>
you
hear
that
?
"
cried
Jem
:
"
'
Tis
Turpin
's
call
.
""Turpin
!
"
<EOS>
echoed
Luke
,
dropping
the
point
of
his
weapon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Unbar
the
door
,
you
treacherous
rascal
,
and
admit
him
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
say
no
more
about
it
,
Sir
Luke
,
"
said
Jem
,
fawningly
;
<EOS>
"
I
knows
I
owes
you
my
life
,
and
I
thank
you
for
it
.
<EOS>
Take
back
the
lowre
.
<EOS>
He
should
not
have
shown
it
me
—
it
was
that
as
did
all
the
mischief
.
<EOS>
""Unbar
<EOS>
the
door
,
and
parley
not
,
"
said
Luke
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
Jem
complied
with
pretended
alacrity
,
but
real
reluctance
,
casting
suspicious
glances
at
Luke
as
he
withdrew
the
bolts
.
<EOS>
The
door
at
length
being
opened
,
haggard
,
exhausted
,
and
covered
with
dust
,
Dick
Turpin
staggered
into
the
hut
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
I
am
here
,
"
said
he
,
with
a
hollow
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
kept
my
word
—
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
I
've
been
damnably
put
to
it
;
but
here
I
am
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
sank
upon
one
of
the
stools
.
<EOS>
"We
heard
you
were
apprehended
,
"
said
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
find
the
information
was
false
,
"
added
he
,
glancing
angrily
at
the
ferryman
.
<EOS>
"Whoever
<EOS>
told
you
that
,
told
you
a
lie
,
Sir
Luke
,
"
replied
Dick
;
"
but
what
are
you
scowling
at
,
old
Charon?—and
<EOS>
you
,
Sir
Luke
?
<EOS>
Why
do
you
glower
at
each
other
?
<EOS>
Make
fast
the
door
—
bolt
it
,
Cerberus
—
right
!
<EOS>
Now
give
me
a
glass
of
brandy
,
and
then
I
'll
talk
—
a
bumper
—
<EOS>
so
—
another
.
<EOS>
What
's
that
I
see
—
a
dead
man
?
<EOS>
Old
Peter
—
<EOS>
Alan
<EOS>
I
mean
—
has
anything
happened
to
him
,
that
he
has
taken
his
measure
there
so
quietly?""Nothing
,
I
trust
,
"
said
Luke
,
stooping
to
raise
up
his
grandsire
.
<EOS>
"
The
blow
has
stunned
him
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
blow
?
<EOS>
"
repeated
Turpin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
there
has
been
a
quarrel
then
?
<EOS>
I
thought
as
much
from
your
amiable
looks
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
we
must
have
no
differences
.
<EOS>
Give
the
old
earthworm
a
taste
of
this
—
I'll
engage
it
will
bring
him
to
fast
enough
.
<EOS>
Ay
,
rub
his
temples
with
it
if
you
'd
rather
;
but
it
's
a
better
remedy
down
the
gullet
—
the
natural
course
;
and
hark
ye
,
Jem
,
search
your
crib
quickly
,
and
see
if
you
have
any
grub
within
it
,
and
any
more
bub
in
the
cellar
<EOS>
:
I
'm
as
hungry
as
a
hunter
,
and
as
thirsty
as
a
camel

<EOS>
Out

iron
!
<EOS>
Thrust

's
Translation
of
Faust
.
<EOS>
CONKEY
JEM
went
in
search
of
such
provisions
as
his
hovel
afforded
.
<EOS>
Turpin
,
meantime
,
lent
his
assistance
towards
the
revival
of
Alan
Rookwood
;
and
it
was
not
long
before
his
efforts
,
united
with
those
of
Luke
,
were
successful
,
and
Alan
restored
to
consciousness
.
<EOS>
He
was
greatly
surprised
to
find
the
highwayman
had
joined
them
,
and
expressed
an
earnest
desire
to
quit
the
hut
as
speedily
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"That
shall
be
done
forthwith
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
said
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
had
fasted
as
long
as
I
have
done
,
and
gone
through
a
few
of
my
fatigues
into
the
bargain
,
you
would
perceive
,
without
difficulty
,
the
propriety
of
supping
before
you
started
.
<EOS>
Here
comes
Old
Nosey
,
with
a
flitch
of
bacon
and
a
loaf
.
<EOS>
Egad
,
I
can
scarce
wait
for
the
toasting
.
<EOS>
In
my
present
mood
,
I
could
almost
devour
a
grunter
in
the
sty
.
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
he
applied
himself
to
the
loaf
,
and
to
a
bottle
of
stout
March
ale
,
which
Jem
placed
upon
the
table
,
quaffing
copious
draughts
of
the
latter
,
while
the
ferryman
employed
himself
in
toasting
certain
rashers
of
the
flitch
upon
the
hissing
embers
.
<EOS>
Luke
,
meanwhile
,
stalked
impatiently
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
had
laid
aside
his
tridental
spear
,
having
first
,
however
,
placed
a
pistol
within
his
breast
to
be
ready
for
instant
service
,
should
occasion
demand
it
,
as
he
could
now
put
little
reliance
upon
the
ferryman
's
fidelity
.
<EOS>
He
glanced
with
impatience
at
Turpin
,
who
pursued
his
meal
with
steady
voracity
,
worthy
of
a
half
-
famished
soldier
;
but
the
highwayman
returned
no
answer
to
his
looks
,
except
such
as
was
conveyed
by
the
incessant
clatter
of
his
masticating
jaws
,
during
the
progress
of
his
,
apparently
,
interminable
repast
.
"Ready
<EOS>
for
you
in
a
second
,
Sir
Luke
,
"
said
Dick
;
"
all
right
now
—
capital
ale
,
Charon
—
strong
as
Styx
—
ha

ha!—one
other
rasher

I
've
done

<EOS>
Sorry
to
keep
you
—
can't
conceive
how
cleverly
I
put
the
winkers
upon
'em
at
York

in
the
dress

all
owing

"Jem
<EOS>
returned
a
sulky
response
,
as
he
placed
the
last
rasher
on
the
table
,
which
was
speedily
discussed
.
<EOS>
"Poor
Bess
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Dick
,
as
he
quaffed
off
the
final
glass
of
ale
.
"
<EOS>

we
buried
her
by

continued
he
,
rising
from
his
seat
,
"
I

with
you

Where
are

growled
Jem

<EOS>
Alan
Rookwood
,
in
the
mean
time
,
had
joined
his
grandson
,
and
they
conversed
an
instant
or
two
apart
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
strength
will
not
bear
me
through
the
night

said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That

the
key

secret
passage

I
will
await
you
in

""The

echoed
Luke
.
<EOS>
"Ay

returned
Alan
,
with
<EOS>
a
ghastly
grin—"it
is
the
only
place
of
security
for
me
now

<EOS>
Let
me
see

there

<EOS>
Let
me
know

my
vengeance

complete

triumph
in

the
accursed

know
now
what
hatred
is

""I

returned
Luke
,
fiercely
.
"But
<EOS>
not
such
hate

pants

fiercely

You
can
not
know
what
hate

may

have
wrongs

such
wrongs

mine
first

<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
hate
to

bitter
as
your
own

<EOS>
""Name

shrieked
Alan
.

"
<EOS>
But
,
oh

to
think
upon
the
bride
he
robbed
me
of
—
the
young

the
beautiful!—whom
I
loved
to
madness
;
whose
memory
is
a
barbed
shaft
,
yet
rankling
keen
as
ever
at
my
heart

<EOS>
God
of
Justice
!
<EOS>
how
is
it
that
I
have
thus
long
survived
?
<EOS>
But
some
men
die
by
inches
.
<EOS>
My
dying
lips
shall
name
him
once
again
,

then
'
twill
be
but
to
blend
his
name
with
curses
.
<EOS>
""I
speak
of

said
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
meet
you

""Remember

he

with

and
he
placed
a
dagger
in
Luke
's
hands

<EOS>
"
It
has
avenged
me

Eleanor
,
"
replied
Luke
;
"
for
,
as
surely
as
I
live
,
Sybil
's
death
will
lie
at
my
door
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
so
?
"
asked
Alan
;
"
the
poison
was
self
-
ministered
.
<EOS>
""True
,
"
replied
Luke
,
with
terrible
emphasis
,
"
but
I
spoke
daggers
.
<EOS>
Hearken
to
me
,
"
said
he
,
hollowly
whispering
in
his
grandsire
's
ears
.
<EOS>
"
Methinks
I
am
not
long
for
this
world
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
her
since
her
death!""Tut
,
tut
,
"
replied
Alan
.
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
not
for
you
—
a
man
—
to
talk
thus
.
<EOS>
A
truce
to
these
womanish
fancies
.
<EOS>
""Womanish
or
not
,
"
returned
Luke
;
"
either
my
fancy
has
deceived
me
,
or
I
beheld
her
,
distinctly
as
I
now
behold
you
,
within
yon
cave
,
while
you
were
sleeping
by
my
side
.
<EOS>
""It
is
disordered
fancy
,
"
said
Alan
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
live
—
live
to
inherit
Rookwood
—
live
to
see
them
fall
crushed
beneath
your
feet
.
<EOS>
For
myself
,
if
I
but
see
you
master
of
Eleanor
's
hand
,
or
know
that
she
no
longer
lives
to
bless
your
rival
,
or
to
mar
your
prospects
<EOS>
,
I
care
not
how
soon
I
brave
my
threatened
doom
.
<EOS>
""Of
one
or
other
<EOS>
you
shall
be
resolved
to
-
night
,
"
said
Luke
,
placing
the
dagger
within
his
vest
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
trampling
of
a
horse
was
heard
before
the
hovel
,
and
in
another
instant
a
loud
knocking
resounded
from
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
ferryman
instantly
extinguished
the
light
,
motioning
his
companions
to
remain
silent
.
<EOS>
"What
,
ho
!
<EOS>
"
shouted
a
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Ferry
wanted
.
<EOS>
""Gad
zooks
!
"
exclaimed
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
I
live
,
'
tis
Major
Mowbray!""Major
Mowbray
!
"
echoed
Alan
,
in
amazement
<EOS>
"
What
doth
he
here?""He
must
be
on
his
way
from
York
to
Rookwood
,
I
conclude
,
"
said
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
's
here
,
I
'll
engage
the
others
are
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
"Scarcely
<EOS>
were
the
words
out
of
Dick
's
mouth
,
when
further
clatter
was
heard
at
the
door
,
and
the
tones
of
Coates
were
heard
,
in
altissimo
key
,
demanding
admittance
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
us
retire
into
the
next
room
,
"
whispered
Turpin
,
"
and
then
admit
them
by
all
means
,
Conkey
.
<EOS>
And
,
hark
ye
,
manage
to
detain
them
a
few
seconds
.
<EOS>
""I'll
do
it
,
"
said
Jem
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
bit
of
a
hole
you
can
peep
through
.
<EOS>
"Another
<EOS>
loud
rat
-
tat
was
heard
at
the
door
,
threatening
to
burst
it
from
its
hinges
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
I
be
coming
,
"
said
Jem
,
seeing
the
coast
was
clear
,
in
a
drowsy
,
yawning
tone
,
as
if
just
awakened
from
sleep
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
cross
the
river
none
the
faster
for
making
so
much
noise
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
these
words
he
unbarred
the
door
,
and
Coates
and
Paterson
,
who
,
it
appeared
,
were
proceeding
to
Rookwood
,
entered
the
hovel
.
<EOS>
Major
Mowbray
remained
on
horseback
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"Can
<EOS>
you
find
us
a
glass
of
brandy
to
keep
out
the
fog
?
"
said
Coates
,
who
knew
something
of
our
ferryman
's
vocations
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
are
a
lad
of
amazing
spirit
.
<EOS>
""May
be
<EOS>
I
can
,
master
,
if
I
choose
.
<EOS>
But
wo
n't
the
other
gemman
walk
in
-
doors
likewise?""No
,
no
,
"
said
Coates
;
"
Major
Mowbray
do
n't
choose
to
dismount
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
as
you
please
,
"
said
Jem
.
<EOS>
"
It
'll
take
me
a
minute
or
two
to
get
the
punt
in
order
for
all
them
prads
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
brandy
in
the
first
place
,
"
said
Coates
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
here
?
<EOS>
"
added
the
loquacious
attorney
,
noticing
the
remnants
of
Turpin
's
repast
.
"
<EOS>
But
that
we
're
hurried
,
I
should
like
a
little
frizzled
bacon
myself
.
<EOS>
"Jem
<EOS>
opened
the
door
of
his
dormitory
with
the
greatest
caution
,
though
apparent
indifference
,
and
almost
instantly
returned
with
the
brandy
.
<EOS>
Coates
filled
a
glass
for
Paterson
,
and
then
another
for
himself
.
<EOS>
The
ferryman
left
the
house
apparently
to
prepare
his
boat
,
half
closing
the
door
after
him
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
my
faith
!
<EOS>
this
is
the
right
thing
,
Paterson
,
"
said
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
"
We
may
be
sure
the
strength
of
this
was
never
tested
by
a
gauger
's
proof
.
<EOS>
Take
another
thimbleful
.
<EOS>
We
've
twelve
miles
and
a
heavy
pull
to
go
through
ere
we
reach
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
we
made
but
a
poor
night
's
work
of
it
,
Master
Constable
.
<EOS>
Cursed
stupid
in
us
to
let
him
escape
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
we
had
such
another
chance
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
if
we
had
him
within
reach
now
,
how
we
would
spring
upon
him
—
secure
him
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
I
should
glory
in
the
encounter
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
,
Paterson
,
if
ever
he
is
taken
,
I
shall
make
a
point
of
attending
his
execution
,
and
see
whether
he
dies
game
.
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
You
think
he
's
sure
to
swing
,
Paterson
,
eh?""Why
,
yes
,
"
replied
the
chief
constable
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
was
as
certain
of
my
reward
as
that
Turpin
will
eventually
figure
at
the
scragging
-
post
.
<EOS>
""Your
reward
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Coates
.
<EOS>
"
Make
yourself
easy
on
that
score
,
my
boy
;
you
shall
have
your
dues
,
depend
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
for
the
matter
of
that
,
I
'll
give
you
the
money
now
,
if
you
think
proper
.
<EOS>
""Nothing
like
time
present
,
"
said
Paterson
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
make
all
square
at
once
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
then
,
"
said
Coates
,
taking
out
a
pocket
-
book
,
"
you
shall
have
the
hundred
I
promised
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
get
Turpin
's
reward
,
the
three
hundred
pounds
;
but
that
ca
n't
be
helped
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
mine
—
always
a
man
of
my
word
,
Paterson
,
"
continued
the
attorney
,
counting
out
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
,
the
thief
-
taker
,
was
a
man
of
his
word
before
me
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
doubt
<EOS>
,
"
said
the
chief
constable
;
"
I
shall
always
be
happy
to
serve
you
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
then
there
's
that
other
affair
,
"
said
the
attorney
,
mysteriously
,
still
occupied
in
doling
out
his
bank
-
notes
,
"
that
Luke
Bradley
's
case
;
the
fellow
,
I
mean
,
who
calls
himself
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
—
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
A
rank
impostor
!
<EOS>
Two
fives
,
that
makes
fifty
:
you
want
another
fifty
,
Paterson
.
<EOS>
As
I
was
saying
,
we
may
make
a
good
job
of
that
—
we
must
ferret
him
out
.
<EOS>
I
know
who
will
come
down
properly
for
that
;
and
if
we
could
only
tuck
him
up
with
his
brother
blade
,
why
it
would
be
worth
double
.
<EOS>
He
's
all
along
been
a
thorn
in
my
Lady
Rookwood
's
side
;
he
's
an
artful
scoundrel
.
<EOS>
""Leave
<EOS>
him
to
me
,
"
said
Paterson
;
"
I
'll
have
him
in
less
than
a
week
.
<EOS>
What
's
your
charge
against
him?""Felony
,
burglary
,
murder
,
every
description
of
crime
under
the
heavens
,
"
said
Coates
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
very
devil
incarnate
.
<EOS>
Dick
Turpin
is
as
mild
as
milk
compared
with
him
.
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
by
,
now
I
think
of
it
,
this
Jem
,
Conkey
Jem
,
as
folks
call
him
,
may
know
something
about
him
;
he
's
a
keen
file
;
I
'll
sound
him
.
<EOS>
Thirty
,
forty
,
fifty
—
there
's
the
exact
amount
.
<EOS>
So
much
for
Dick
Turpin
.
<EOS>
""Dick
<EOS>
Turpin
thanks
you
for
it
in
person
,
"
said
Dick
,
suddenly
snatching
the
whole
sum
from
Paterson
's
hands
,
and
felling
the
chief
constable
with
a
blow
of
one
of
his
pistols
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
was
as
sure
of
escaping
the
gallows
as
I
am
certain
that
Paterson
has
got
his
reward
.
<EOS>
You
stare
,
sir
.
<EOS>
You
are
once
more
in
the
hands
of
the
Philistines
.
<EOS>
See
who
is
at
your
elbow
.
<EOS>
"Coates
,
who
was
terrified
almost
out
of
his
senses
at
the
sight
of
Turpin
,
scarcely
ventured
to
turn
his
head
;
<EOS>
but
when
he
did
so
,
he
was
perfectly
horror
-
stricken
at
the
threatening
aspect
of
Luke
,
who
held
a
cutlass
in
his
hand
,
which
he
had
picked
up
in
the
ferryman
's
bedroom
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
you
would
condemn
me
for
crimes
I
have
never
committed
,
"
said
Luke
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
tempted
,
I
own
,
to
add
the
destruction
of
your
worthless
existence
to
their
number
.
<EOS>
""Mercy
,
for
God
's
sake
,
mercy
!
"
cried
Coates
,
throwing
himself
at
Luke
's
feet
.
<EOS>
"
I
meant
not
what
I
said
.
<EOS>
""Hence
,
reptile
,
"
said
Luke
,
pushing
him
aside
;
"
I
leave
you
to
be
dealt
upon
by
others
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
juncture
,
the
door
of
the
hut
was
flung
open
,
and
in
rushed
Major
Mowbray
,
sword
in
hand
,
followed
by
Conkey
Jem
.
"There
<EOS>
he
stands
,
sir
,
"
cried
the
latter
;
"
upon
him!""What
!
<EOS>
Conkey
Jem
turned
snitch
upon
his
pals
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Dick
<EOS>
;
"
I
scarce
believe
my
own
ears
.
<EOS>
""Make
<EOS>
yourself
scarce
,
Dick
,
"
growled
Jem
;
"
the
jigger
's
open
,
and
the
boat
loose
.
<EOS>
Leave
Luke
to
his
fate
.
<EOS>
He
's
sold
.
<EOS>
""Never
!
<EOS>
vile
traitor
,
"
shouted
Dick
;
"
'
tis
thou
art
sold
,
not
he
;
"
and
,
almost
ere
<EOS>
the
words
were
spoken
,
a
ball
was
lodged
in
the
brain
of
the
treacherous
ferryman
.
<EOS>
Major
Mowbray
,
meanwhile
,
had
rushed
furiously
upon
Luke
,
who
met
his
assault
with
determined
calmness
.
<EOS>
The
strife
was
sharp
,
and
threatened
a
speedy
and
fatal
issue
.
<EOS>
On
the
Major
's
side
it
was
a
desperate
attack
of
cut
and
thrust
,
which
Luke
had
some
difficulty
in
parrying
;
but
as
yet
no
wounds
were
inflicted
.
<EOS>
Soldier
as
was
the
Major
,
Luke
was
not
a
whit
inferior
to
him
in
his
knowledge
of
the
science
of
defence
,
and
in
the
exercise
of
the
broadsword
he
was
perhaps
the
more
skilful
of
the
two
:
upon
the
present
occasion
his
coolness
stood
him
in
admirable
stead
.
<EOS>
Seeing
him
hard
pressed
,
Turpin
would
have
come
to
his
assistance
;
but
Luke
shouted
to
him
to
stand
aside
,
and
all
that
Dick
could
do
,
amid
the
terrific
clash
of
steel
,
was
to
kick
the
tables
out
of
the
way
of
the
combatants
.
<EOS>
Luke
's
aim
was
now
slightly
grazed
by
a
cut
made
by
the
Major
,
which
he
had
parried
.
<EOS>
The
smart
of
the
wound
roused
his
ire
.
<EOS>
He
attacked
his
adversary
in
his
turn
,
with
so
much
vigor
and
good
will
,
that
,
driven
backwards
by
the
irresistible
assault
,
Major
Mowbray
stumbled
over
the
ferryman
's
body
,
which
happened
to
lie
in
his
way
;
and
his
sword
being
struck
from
his
grasp
,
his
life
became
at
once
at
his
assailant
's
disposal
.
<EOS>
Luke
sheathed
his
sword
.
"
<EOS>
Major
Mowbray
,
"
said
he
,
sternly
,
"
your
life
is
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
I
spare
it
for
the
blood
that
is
between
us
—
for
your
sister
's
sake
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
raise
my
hand
against
her
brother
.
<EOS>
""I
disclaim
your
kindred
with
me
,
villain
!
"
<EOS>
wrathfully
exclaimed
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
I
hold
you
<EOS>
no
otherwise
than
as
a
wretched
impostor
,
who
has
set
up
claims
he
can
not
justify
;
and
as
to
my
sister
,
if
you
dare
to
couple
her
name
—
—
"
and
the
Major
made
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
raise
himself
,
and
to
regain
his
sword
,
which
Turpin
,
however
,
removed
.
<EOS>
"Dare
!
"
echoed
Luke
,
scornfully
;
"
hereafter
,
you
may
learn
to
fear
my
threats
,
and
acknowledge
the
extent
of
my
daring
;
and
in
that
confidence
I
give
you
life
.
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
am
bound
for
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
I
have
private
access
to
the
house
—
to
your
sister
's
chamber
—
her
chamber
—
mark
you
that
!
<EOS>
I
shall
go
armed
—
attended
.
<EOS>
This
night
she
shall
be
mine
.
<EOS>
From
you
—
from
Ranulph
—
from
Lady
Rookwood
,
from
all
will
I
bear
her
off
.
<EOS>
She
shall
be
mine
,
and
you
,
before
the
dawn
,
my
brother
,
or
—
—
"
And
Luke
paused
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
further
villainy
remains
untold
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
Major
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
shall
bewail
your
sister
's
memory
,
"
replied
Luke
,
gloomily
.
<EOS>
"I
embrace
the
latter
alternative
with
rapture
,
"
replied
the
Major—"God
grant
her
firmness
to
resist
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
tremble
for
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
stern
soldier
groaned
aloud
in
his
agony
.
<EOS>
"Here
is
a
cord
to
bind
him
,
"
said
Turpin
;
"
he
must
remain
a
prisoner
here
.
<EOS>
""Right
,
"
said
Alan
Rookwood
,
"
unless
—
but
enough
blood
has
been
shed
already
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
marry
has
there
,
"
said
Dick
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
had
rather
not
have
given
Conkey
Jem
a
taste
of
blue
plumb
,
had
there
been
any
other
mode
of
silencing
the
snitching
scoundrel
,
which
there
was
not
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
Major
,
he
's
a
gallant
enemy
,
and
shall
have
fair
play
as
long
as
Dick
Turpin
stands
by
.
<EOS>
Come
,
sir
,
"
added
he
,
to
the
Major
,
as
he
bound
him
hand
and
foot
with
the
rope
,
"
I
'll
do
it
as
gently
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
submit
with
a
good
grace
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
help
for
it
.
<EOS>
And
now
for
my
friend
Paterson
,
who
was
so
anxious
to
furnish
me
with
a
hempen
cravat
,
before
my
neck
was
in
order
,
he
shall
have
an
extra
twist
of
the
rope
himself
,
to
teach
him
the
inconvenience
of
a
tight
neckcloth
when
he
recovers
.
<EOS>
"
Saying
which
,
he
bound
Paterson
in
such
a
manner
,
that
any
attempt
at
liberation
on
the
chief
constable
's
part
would
infallibly
strangle
him
.
"
<EOS>
As
to
you
,
Mr.
Coates
,
"
said
he
,
addressing
the
trembling
man
of
law
,
"
you
shall
proceed
to
Rookwood
with
us
.
<EOS>
You
may
yet
be
useful
,
and
I
'll
accommodate
you
with
a
seat
behind
my
own
saddle
—
a
distinction
I
never
yet
conferred
upon
any
of
your
tribe
.
<EOS>
Recollect
the
countryman
at
the
Bowling
-
green
at
York
—
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
Come
along
,
sir
.
"
<EOS>
And
having
kicked
out
the
turf
fire
,
Dick
prepared
to
depart
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
vain
to
describe
the
feelings
of
rage
and
despair
which
agitated
the
major
's
bosom
,
as
he
saw
the
party
quit
the
hovel
,
accompanied
by
Coates
.
<EOS>
Aware
as
he
was
of
their
destination
,
after
one
or
two
desperate
but
ineffectual
attempts
to
liberate
himself
,
by
which
he
only
increased
the
painful
constriction
of
his
bonds
,
without
in
the
slightest
degree
ameliorating
his
condition
,
he
resigned
himself
,
with
bitterest
forebodings
,
to
his
fate
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
one
even
to
sympathize
with
his
sufferings
.
<EOS>
Beside
him
lay
the
gory
corpse
of
the
ferryman
,
and
,
at
a
little
distance
,
the
scarcely
more
animate
frame
of
the
chief
constable
.
<EOS>
And
here
we
must
leave
him
,
to
follow
,
for
a
short
space
,
the
course
of
Luke
and
his
companions
.
<EOS>
Concerning
themselves
little
about
their
own
steeds
,
the
party
took
those
which
first
offered
,
and
embarking
man
and
horse
in
the
boat
,
soon
pushed
across
the
waters
of
the
lutulent
Don
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
opposite
banks
of
the
river
,
they
mounted
,
and
,
guided
by
Luke
,
after
half
an
hour
's
sharp
riding
,
arrived
at
the
skirts
of
Rookwood
Park
.
<EOS>
Entering
this
beautiful
sylvan
domain
,
they
rode
for
some
time
silently
among
the
trees
,
till
they
reached
<EOS>
the
knoll
whence
Luke
beheld
the
hall
on
the
eventful
night
of
his
discovery
of
his
mother
's
wedding
ring
.
<EOS>
A
few
days
only
had
elapsed
,
but
during
that
brief
space
what
storms
had
swept
over
his
bosom
—
what
ravages
had
they
not
made
!
<EOS>
He
was
then
all
ardor
—
all
impetuosity
—
all
independence
.
<EOS>
The
future
presented
a
bright
unclouded
prospect
.
<EOS>
Wealth
,
honors
,
and
happiness
apparently
awaited
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
still
the
same
exquisite
scene
,
hushed
,
holy
,
tranquil
—
even
solemn
,
as
upon
that
glorious
night
.
<EOS>
The
moon
was
out
,
silvering
wood
and
water
,
and
shining
on
the
white
walls
of
the
tranquil
mansion
.
<EOS>
Nature
was
calm
,
serene
,
peaceful
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Beneath
the
trees
,
he
saw
the
bounding
deer
—
upon
the
water
,
the
misty
wreaths
of
vapor
—
all
,
all
was
dreamy
,
delightful
,
soothing
,
all
save
his
heart
<EOS>
—
there
was
the
conflict
—
there
the
change
.
<EOS>
Was
it
a
troubled
dream
,
with
the
dark
oppression
of
which
he
was
struggling
,
or
was
it
stern
,
waking
,
actual
life
?
<EOS>
That
moment
's
review
of
his
wild
career
was
terrible
.
<EOS>
He
saw
to
what
extremes
his
ungovernable
passions
had
hurried
him
;
he
saw
their
inevitable
consequences
;
he
saw
also
his
own
fate
;
but
he
rushed
madly
on
.
<EOS>
He
swept
round
the
park
,
keeping
under
the
covert
of
the
wood
,
till
he
arrived
at
the
avenue
leading
to
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
The
stems
of
the
aged
limes
gleamed
silvery
white
in
the
moonshine
.
<EOS>
Luke
drew
in
the
rein
beneath
one
of
the
largest
of
the
trees
.
<EOS>
"A
branch
has
fallen
,
"
said
he
,
as
his
grandsire
joined
him
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
"
exclaimed
Alan
,
"
a
branch
from
that
tree?""It
bodes
ill
to
Ranulph
,
"
whispered
Luke
,
"
does
it
not?""Perchance
,
"
muttered
Alan
.
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
vast
bough!""We
meet
within
an
hour
,
"
said
Luke
,
abruptly
.
<EOS>
"Within
<EOS>
the
tomb
of
our
ancestry
,
"
replied
Alan
;
"
I
will
await
you
there
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
as
he
rode
away
,
Alan
murmured
to
himself
the
following
verse
from
one
of
his
own
ballads
:
<EOS>
But
whether
gale
or
calm
prevail
,
or
threatening
cloud
hath
fled
,
By
hand
of
Fate
,
predestinate
,
a
limb
that
tree
will
shed
—
A
verdant
bough
,
untouched
,
I
trow
,
by
axe
or
tempest
's
breath
—
<EOS>
To
Rookwood
's
head
an
omen
dread
of
fast
approaching
death
.

CHAPTER
III
.
—
HANDASSAHI
have
heard
it
rumored
for
these
many
years
,
None
of
our
family
dies
but
there
is
seenThe
shape
of
an
old
woman
,
which
is
givenBy
tradition
to
us
to
have
been
murtheredBy
her
nephews
for
her
riches
.
<EOS>
Such
a
figureOne
night
,
as
the
prince
sat
up
late
at
's
book
,
Appeared
to
him
;
when
,
crying
out
for
help
,
The
gentleman
of
his
chamber
found
his
GraceAll
in
a
cold
sweat
,
altered
much
in
faceAnd
language
,
since
which
apparitionHe
hath
grown
worse
and
worse
,
and
much
I
fearHe
can
not
live.—Duchess
of
Malfy
.
<EOS>
IN
one
of
those
large
antique
rooms
,
belonging
to
the
suite
of
apartments
constituting
the
eastern
wing
of
Rookwood
Place
—
upon
the
same
night
as
that
in
which
the
events
just
detailed
took
place
,
and
it
might
be
about
the
same
time
,
sat
Eleanor
,
and
her
new
attendant
,
the
gipsy
Handassah
.
<EOS>
The
eyes
of
the
former
were
fixed
,
with
a
mixture
of
tenderness
and
pity
,
upon
the
lineaments
of
another
lovely
female
countenance
,
bearing
a
striking
resemblance
to
her
own
,
though
evidently
,
from
its
attire
,
and
bygone
costume
,
not
intended
for
her
,
depicted
upon
a
tablet
,
and
placed
upon
a
raised
frame
.
<EOS>
It
was
nigh
the
witching
hour
of
night
.
<EOS>
The
room
was
sombre
and
dusky
,
partially
dismantled
of
its
once
flowing
arras
,
and
the
lights
set
upon
the
table
feebly
illumined
its
dreary
extent
.
<EOS>
Tradition
marked
it
out
as
the
chamber
in
which
many
of
the
hapless
dames
of
Rookwood
had
expired
;
and
hence
Superstition
claimed
it
as
her
peculiar
domain
.
<EOS>
The
room
was
reputed
to
be
haunted
,
and
had
for
a
long
space
shared
the
fate
of
haunted
rooms
—
complete
desertion
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
tenanted
by
one
too
young
,
too
pure
,
to
fear
aught
unearthly
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
seemed
,
nevertheless
,
affected
by
the
profound
melancholy
of
the
picture
upon
which
she
gazed
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
Handassah
observed
her
start
,
and
avert
her
eye
shudderingly
from
the
picture
.
<EOS>
"Take
<EOS>
it
hence
,
"
exclaimed
Eleanor
;
"
I
have
looked
at
that
image
of
my
ancestors
,
till
it
has
seemed
endowed
with
life
—
till
its
eyes
have
appeared
to
return
my
gaze
,
and
weep
.
<EOS>
Remove
it
,
Handassah
.
<EOS>
"Handassah
silently
withdrew
the
tablet
,
placing
it
against
the
wall
of
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
there
—
not
there
,
"
cried
Eleanor
;
"
turn
it
with
its
face
to
the
wall
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
those
eyes
.
<EOS>
And
now
come
hither
,
girl
—
draw
nearer
—
<EOS>
for
I
know
not
what
of
sudden
dread
has
crossed
me
.
<EOS>
This
was
her
room
,
Handassah
—
the
chamber
of
my
ancestress
—
of
all
the
Ladies
Rookwood
—
where
they
say
——
<EOS>
Ha
!
did
you
not
hear
a
noise?—a
rustle
in
the
tapestry
—
a
footstep
near
the
wall
?
<EOS>
Why
,
you
look
as
startled
as
I
look
,
wench
;
stay
by
me
—
I
will
not
have
you
stir
from
my
side—'twas
mere
fancy
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
doubt
,
lady
,
"
said
Handassah
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
arras
.
<EOS>
"Hist
!
"
exclaimed
Eleanor
,
"
there
'
tis
again
.
<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
nothing
,
"
replied
Handassah
.
<EOS>
But
her
looks
belied
her
words
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
I
will
command
myself
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
endeavoring
to
regain
her
calmness
;
"
but
the
thoughts
of
the
Lady
Eleanor
—
for
she
was
an
Eleanor
like
to
me
,
Handassah
—
and
ah
!
<EOS>
even
more
ill
-
fated
and
unhappy
—
have
brought
a
whole
train
of
melancholy
fancies
into
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
banish
them
:
<EOS>
nay
,
though
painful
to
me
,
I
recur
to
these
images
of
dread
with
a
species
of
fascination
,
as
if
in
their
fate
I
contemplated
mine
own
.
<EOS>
Not
one
,
who
hath
wedded
a
Rookwood
,
but
hath
rued
it
.
<EOS>
""Yet
<EOS>
you
will
we
d
one
,
"
said
Handassah
.
<EOS>
"He
is
not
like
the
rest
,
"
said
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
know
you
that
,
lady
?
"
asked
Handassah
.
<EOS>
"
His
time
may
not
yet
be
come
.
<EOS>
See
what
to
-
morrow
will
bring
forth
.
<EOS>
""You
are
averse
to
my
marriage
with
Ranulph
,
Handassah
.
<EOS>
""I
was
<EOS>
Sybil
's
handmaid
ere
<EOS>
I
was
yours
,
lady
.
<EOS>
I
bear
in
mind
a
solemn
compact
with
the
dead
,
which
this
marriage
will
violate
.
<EOS>
You
are
plighted
by
oath
to
another
,
if
he
should
demand
your
hand
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
he
has
not
demanded
it
.
<EOS>
""Would
<EOS>
you
accept
him
were
he
to
do
so
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Handassah
,
suddenly
.
<EOS>
"I
meant
not
that
,
"
replied
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
My
oath
is
annulled
.
<EOS>
""Say
<EOS>
not
so
,
lady
<EOS>
,
"
cried
Handassah—"'twas
not
for
this
that
Sybil
spared
your
life
.
<EOS>
I
love
you
,
but
I
loved
Sybil
,
and
I
would
see
her
dying
behests
complied
with
.
<EOS>
""It
may
not
be
,
Handassah
,
"
replied
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
from
a
phantom
sense
of
honor
,
am
I
to
sacrifice
my
whole
existence
to
one
who
neither
can
love
me
,
nor
whom
I
myself
could
love
?
<EOS>
Am
I
to
we
d
<EOS>
this
man
because
,
in
her
blind
idolatry
of
him
,
Sybil
enforced
an
oath
upon
me
which
I
had
no
power
to
resist
,
and
which
was
mentally
cancelled
while
taken
?
<EOS>
Recall
not
<EOS>
the
horrors
of
that
dreadful
cell
—
urge
not
the
subject
more
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
in
the
hope
that
I
may
be
freed
for
ever
from
this
persecution
that
I
have
consented
thus
early
to
we
d
with
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
This
will
set
Luke
's
fancied
claims
at
rest
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"Handassah
<EOS>
answered
not
,
but
bent
her
head
,
as
if
in
acquiescence
.
<EOS>
Steps
were
now
heard
near
the
door
,
and
a
servant
ushered
in
Dr.
Small
and
Mrs.
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
"I
am
come
to
take
leave
of
you
for
the
night
,
my
dear
young
lady
,
"
said
the
doctor
;
"
but
before
I
start
for
the
Vicarage
,
I
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
,
in
addition
to
the
advice
you
were
so
obliging
as
to
receive
from
me
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Suppose
you
allow
your
attendant
to
retire
for
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
What
I
have
got
to
say
concerns
yourself
solely
.
<EOS>
Your
mother
will
bear
us
company
.
<EOS>
There
,
"
continued
the
doctor
,
as
Handassah
was
dismissed—"I
am
glad
that
dark
-
faced
gipsy
has
taken
her
departure
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
I
like
her
sharp
suspicious
manner
,
and
the
first
exercise
I
should
make
at
my
powers
,
were
I
to
be
your
husband
,
should
be
to
discharge
the
handmaiden
.
<EOS>
To
the
point
of
my
visit
.
<EOS>
We
are
alone
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
queer
old
house
,
Miss
Mowbray
;
and
this
is
the
queerest
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
Walls
have
ears
,
they
say
;
and
there
are
so
many
holes
and
corners
in
this
mansion
,
that
one
ought
never
to
talk
secrets
above
one
's
breath
.
<EOS>
""I
am
yet
to
learn
,
sir
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
"
that
there
is
any
secret
to
be
communicated
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
,
not
much
,
I
own
,
"
replied
the
doctor
;
"
at
least
what
has
occurred
is
no
secret
in
the
house
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
hashappened?""It
is
impossible
for
me
to
conjecture
.
<EOS>
Nothing
to
Ranulph
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
""Nothing
of
consequence
,
I
trust,—though
<EOS>
he
is
part
concerned
with
it
.
<EOS>
""What
is
it
?
"
asked
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"Pray
satisfy
her
curiosity
,
doctor
,
"
interposed
Mrs.
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
then
,
"
said
Small
,
rather
more
gravely
,
"
the
fact
of
the
matter
stands
thus:—Lady
Rookwood
,
who
,
as
you
know
,
was
not
the
meekest
wife
in
the
world
<EOS>
,
now
turns
out
by
no
means
the
gentlest
mother
,
and
has
within
this
hour
found
out
that
she
has
some
objection
to
your
union
with
her
son
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
alarm
me
,
doctor
.
<EOS>
""Don't
<EOS>
alarm
yourself
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
got
over
without
difficulty
,
and
only
requires
a
little
management
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
is
with
her
now
,
and
I
doubt
not
will
arrange
all
to
her
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
""What
was
her
objection
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Eleanor
;
"
was
it
any
one
founded
upon
my
obligation
to
Luke
—
my
oath?""Tut
,
tut
!
<EOS>
dismiss
that
subject
from
your
mind
entirely
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
oath
is
no
more
binding
on
your
conscience
than
would
have
been
the
ties
of
marriage
<EOS>
had
you
been
wedded
by
yon
recusant
Romish
priest
,
Father
Checkley
,
upon
whose
guilty
head
the
Lord
be
merciful
!
<EOS>
Bestow
not
a
thought
upon
it
.
<EOS>
My
anxiety
,
together
with
that
of
your
mother
,
is
to
see
you
now
,
as
speedily
as
may
be
,
wedded
to
Ranulph
,
and
then
that
idle
question
is
set
at
rest
for
ever
;
and
therefore
,
even
if
such
a
thing
were
to
occur
as
that
Lady
Rookwood
should
not
yield
her
consent
to
your
marriage
,
as
that
consent
is
totally
unnecessary
,
we
must
go
through
the
ceremonial
without
it
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
grounds
of
Lady
Rookwood
's
objections
<EOS>
—
—
"
said
Mrs.
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
the
grounds
of
her
ladyship
's
objections
,
"
interposed
Small
,
who
,
when
he
had
once
got
the
lead
,
liked
nobody
to
talk
<EOS>
but
himself
,
"
are
simply
these
,
and
exactly
the
sort
of
objections
one
would
expect
her
to
raise
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
bear
the
idea
of
abandoning
the
control
of
the
house
and
estates
to
other
hands
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
,
and
will
not
relinquish
her
station
,
as
head
of
the
establishment
,
which
Ranulph
has
insisted
upon
as
your
right
.
<EOS>
I
thought
,
when
I
conversed
with
her
on
this
subject
,
that
she
was
changed
,
butNaturam
expellas
furca
,
tamen
usque
recurret
.
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
She
is
,
and
always
will
be
,
the
same
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
did
not
Ranulph
concede
the
point
to
her
?
<EOS>
I
wish
not
to
dwell
here
.
<EOS>
I
care
not
for
these
domains
—
for
this
mansion
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
charms
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
be
happy
with
Ranulph
anywhere
—
happier
anywhere
than
here
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
kind
-
hearted
doctor
squeezed
her
hand
in
reply
,
brushing
a
tear
from
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
did
he
not
concede
it
?
"
said
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
proudly
.
<EOS>
"
Because
the
choice
remained
not
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
his
to
concede
.
<EOS>
This
house
—
these
lands
—
all
—
all
are
yours
;
and
it
were
poor
requital
,
indeed
,
if
,
after
they
have
so
long
been
wrongfully
withheld
from
us
,
you
should
be
a
dependant
on
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
""Without
going
quite
so
far
as
that
,
madam
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
"
it
is
but
justice
to
your
daughter
that
she
should
be
put
in
full
possession
of
her
rights
;
nor
should
I
for
one
instant
advise
,
or
even
allow
her
to
inhabit
the
same
house
with
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
's
peculiarities
of
temper
are
such
as
to
preclude
all
possibility
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
I
trust
by
management
—
always
by
management
,
madam
—
that
her
ladyship
's
quiet
departure
may
be
ensured
.
<EOS>
I
understand
that
all
such
legal
arrangements
in
the
way
of
settlements
as
could
be
entered
into
between
your
daughter
and
her
future
husband
are
completed
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
to
regret
the
absence
of
my
friend
,
Mr.
Coates
,
at
this
momentous
conjuncture
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
loss
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
inherits
from
his
father
a
taste
for
thief
-
taking
,
which
he
is
at
present
indulging
,
to
the
manifest
injury
of
his
legitimate
practice
.
<EOS>
Hark
!
<EOS>
I
hear
Ranulph
's
step
in
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
He
will
tell
us
the
result
of
his
final
interview
.
<EOS>
I
came
to
give
you
advice
,
my
dear
,
"
added
the
doctor
in
a
low
tone
to
Eleanor
;
"
but
I
find
you
need
it
not
.
'
<EOS>
Whoso
humbleth
himself
,
shall
be
exalted
.
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
do
not
split
upon
the
rock
which
has
stranded
half
your
generation
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
Ranulph
Rookwood
entered
the
room
,
followed
by
Handassah
,
who
took
her
station
at
the
back
of
the
room
,
unperceived
by
the
rest
of
the
party
,
whose
attention
was
attracted
by
Ranulph
's
agitated
manner
.
<EOS>
"What
has
happened
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Dr.
Small
and
Mrs.
Mowbray
in
the
same
breath
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
hesitated
for
a
moment
in
his
answer
,
during
which
space
he
regarded
Eleanor
with
the
deepest
anxiety
,
and
seemed
revolving
within
himself
how
he
could
frame
his
reply
in
such
way
as
should
be
least
painful
to
her
feelings
;
while
,
with
instinctive
apprehension
of
coming
misfortune
,
Miss
Mowbray
eagerly
seconded
the
inquiries
of
her
friends
.
<EOS>
"It
is
with
great
pain
,
"
said
he
,
at
length
,
in
a
tone
of
despondency
,
not
unmingled
with
displeasure
,
"
that
I
am
obliged
to
descant
upon
the
infirmities
of
a
parent
,
and
to
censure
her
conduct
as
severely
as
I
may
do
now
.
<EOS>
I
feel
the
impropriety
of
such
a
step
,
and
I
would
willingly
avoid
it
,
could
I
do
so
in
justice
to
my
own
feelings
—
and
especially
at
a
moment
like
the
present
—
when
every
hope
of
my
life
is
fixed
upon
uniting
myself
to
you
,
dear
Eleanor
,
by
ties
as
near
as
my
own
to
that
parent
.
<EOS>
But
the
interview
which
I
have
just
had
with
Lady
Rookwood
—
bitter
and
heart
-
breaking
as
it
has
been
—
compels
me
to
reprobate
her
conduct
in
the
strongest
terms
,
as
harsh
,
unjust
,
and
dishonorable
;
and
if
I
could
wholly
throw
off
the
son
,
as
she
avows
she
has
thrown
off
the
mother
,
I
should
unhesitatingly
pronounce
it
as
little
short
<EOS>
of——""Dear
Ranulph
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
palpitating
with
apprehension
,
"
I
never
saw
you
so
much
moved
.
<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
with
so
much
reason
,
"
rejoined
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
myself
,
I
could
endure
anything
—
but
for
you——""And
does
your
dispute
relate
to
me
?
"
asked
Eleanor
.
"
<EOS>
Is
it
for
my
sake
<EOS>
you
have
braved
your
mother
's
displeasure
?
<EOS>
Is
it
because
Lady
Rookwood
is
unwilling
to
resign
the
control
of
this
house
and
these
lands
to
me
,
that
you
have
parted
in
anger
with
her
?
<EOS>
Was
this
<EOS>
the
cause
of
your
quarrel?""It
was
the
origin
of
it
,
"
replied
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"Mother
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
firmly
,
to
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
"
go
with
me
to
Lady
Rookwood
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
""Wherefore
?
"
demanded
Mrs.
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
"Question
<EOS>
me
not
,
dear
mother
,
or
let
me
go
alone
.
<EOS>
""Daughter
<EOS>
,
I
guess
your
meaning
,
"
said
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
relinquish
your
claims
in
favor
of
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
so?""Since
<EOS>
you
oblige
me
to
answer
you
,
mother
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
crimsoning
,
"
I
must
admit
that
you
have
guessed
my
meaning
.
<EOS>
To
Lady
Rookwood
,
as
to
yourself
,
I
would
be
a
daughter
as
far
as
is
consistent
with
my
duty
,
"
added
she
,
blushing
still
more
deeply
,
"
but
my
first
consideration
shall
be
my
husband
.
<EOS>
And
if
Lady
Rookwood
can
be
content
——
But
pray
question
me
not
further
—
accompany
me
to
her
chamber
.
<EOS>
""Eleanor
,
"
interposed
Ranulph
,
"
dearest
Eleanor
,
the
sacrifice
you
would
make
is
unnecessary
—
uncalled
for
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
my
mother
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
,
I
grieve
to
say
,
appreciate
the
generosity
of
your
motives
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
give
you
credit
for
your
feelings
.
<EOS>
She
would
only
resent
your
visit
as
an
intrusion
.
<EOS>
""My
daughter
comprehends
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
haughtily
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
care
that
,
in
her
own
house
,
Miss
Mowbray
shall
remain
free
from
insult
.
<EOS>
""Mother
,
dear
mother
,
"
said
Eleanor
,
"
do
not
wilfully
misunderstand
him
.
<EOS>
""You
can
be
little
aware
,
madam
,
"
said
Ranulph
,
calmly
,
yet
sadly
,
"
how
much
I
have
recently
endured
—
how
much
of
parental
anger
—
how
much
of
parental
malediction
I
have
incurred
,
to
save
you
and
your
daughter
from
the
indignity
you
apprehend
.
<EOS>
As
I
before
said
,
you
do
not
know
my
mother
;
nor
could
it
enter
into
any
well
-
regulated
imagination
to
conceive
the
extremities
to
which
the
violence
of
her
passion
will
,
when
her
schemes
are
thwarted
,
hurry
her
.
<EOS>
The
terms
upon
which
you
met
together
will
not
escape
your
recollection
;
nor
shall
I
need
to
recall
to
your
mind
her
haughtiness
,
her
coldness
.
<EOS>
That
coldness
has
since
ripened
into
distrust
;
and
the
match
which
she
was
at
first
all
anxiety
to
promote
,
she
would
now
utterly
set
aside
,
were
it
in
her
power
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Whence
this
alteration
in
her
views
has
arisen
,
I
have
no
means
of
ascertaining
;
it
is
not
my
mother
's
custom
to
give
a
reason
for
her
actions
,
or
her
wishes
:
<EOS>
it
is
all
-
sufficient
to
express
them
.
<EOS>
I
have
perceived
,
as
the
time
has
drawn
nigh
for
the
fulfilment
of
my
dearest
hopes
,
that
her
unwillingness
has
increased
;
until
to
-
day
,
what
had
hitherto
been
confined
to
hints
,
has
been
openly
expressed
,
and
absolute
objections
raised
.
<EOS>
Such
,
however
,
is
the
peculiarity
of
her
temper
,
that
I
trusted
,
even
at
the
eleventh
hour
,
I
should
be
able
to
work
a
change
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
our
last
meeting
was
decisive
.
<EOS>
She
commanded
me
to
break
off
the
match
.
<EOS>
At
once
,
and
peremptorily
,
I
refused
.
<EOS>
Pardon
me
,
madam
,
pardon
me
,
dearest
Eleanor
<EOS>
,
if
I
thus
enter
into
particulars
;
it
is
absolutely
necessary
I
should
be
explicit
.
<EOS>
Enraged
at
my
opposition
to
her
wishes
,
her
fury
became
ungovernable
.
<EOS>
With
appalling
imprecations
upon
the
memory
of
my
poor
father
,
and
upon
your
father
,
madam
,
whose
chief
offence
in
her
eyes
was
,
it
seems
,
the
disposition
of
his
property
to
Eleanor
,
she
bade
me
be
gone
,
and
take
her
curses
as
my
wedding
portion
.
<EOS>
Beneath
this
roof
—
beneath
herroof
,
she
added
—
no
marriage
of
mine
should
e'er
take
place
.
<EOS>
I
might
go
hence
,
or
might
stay
,
as
I
thought
fitting
;
but
you
and
your
daughter
,
whom
she
characterized
as
intruders
,
should
not
remain
another
hour
within
her
house
.
<EOS>
To
this
wild
raving
I
answered
,
with
as
much
composure
as
I
could
command
,
that
she
entirely
mistook
her
own
position
,
and
that
,
so
far
from
the
odium
of
intrusion
resting
with
you
,
if
applicable
to
any
one
,
the
term
must
necessarily
affix
itself
on
those
who
,
through
ignorance
,
had
for
years
unjustly
deprived
the
rightful
owners
of
this
place
of
their
inheritance
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
her
wrath
was
boundless
.
<EOS>
She
disowned
me
as
her
son
;
disclaimed
all
maternal
regard
,
and
heaped
upon
my
head
a
frightful
malediction
,
at
the
recollection
of
which
I
still
tremble
.
<EOS>
I
will
spare
you
further
details
of
this
dreadful
scene
.
<EOS>
To
me
it
is
most
distressing
;
for
,
however
firmly
resolved
I
may
be
to
pursue
a
line
of
conduct
which
every
sound
principle
within
me
dictates
as
the
correct
one
,
yet
I
can
not
be
insensible
to
the
awful
responsibility
I
shall
incur
in
bringing
down
a
mother
's
curse
upon
my
head
,
nor
to
the
jeopardy
in
which
her
own
excessive
violence
may
place
her
.
<EOS>
"Mrs
.
<EOS>
Mowbray
listened
to
Ranulph
's
explanation
in
haughty
displeasure
;
Eleanor
with
throbbing
,
tearful
interest
;
Dr.
Small
,
with
mixed
feelings
of
anger
and
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"Lady
<EOS>
Rookwood
's
conduct
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
"
is
—
<EOS>
you
must
forgive
me
,
my
dear
Sir
Ranulph
,
for
using
strong
expressions
—
outrageous
beyond
all
precedent
,
and
only
excusable
on
the
ground
of
insanity
,
to
which
I
wish
it
were
possible
we
could
attribute
it
.
<EOS>
There
is
,
however
,
too
much
method
in
her
madness
to
allow
us
to
indulge
any
such
notion
;
she
is
shrewd
,
dangerous
,
and
designing
;
and
,
since
she
has
resolved
to
oppose
this
match
,
she
will
leave
no
means
untried
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
scarcely
know
how
to
advise
you
under
the
circumstances
—
that
is
,
if
my
advice
were
asked
.
<EOS>
""Which
I
scarcely
think
it
likely
to
be
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
what
has
occurred
,
I
shall
think
it
my
duty
to
break
off
this
alliance
,
which
I
have
never
considered
to
be
so
desirable
that
its
rupture
will
occasion
me
an
instant
's
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
""A
plague
on
all
these
Rookwoods
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Small
.
<EOS>
"
One
would
think
all
the
pride
of
the
Prince
of
Darkness
were
centered
in
their
bosoms
.
<EOS>
But
,
madam
,
"
continued
the
benevolent
doctor
,
"
have
you
no
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
your
daughter
,
or
for
those
of
one
who
is
no
distant
relation
to
you
—
your
nephew
?
<EOS>
Your
son
,
Major
Mowbray
,
is
,
if
I
mistake
not
,
most
eager
for
this
union
to
take
place
between
his
sister
and
his
friend
.
<EOS>
""My
children
have
been
accustomed
to
yield
implicit
obedience
to
my
wishes
,
"
said
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
"
and
Major
Mowbray
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
will
see
the
propriety
of
the
step
I
am
about
to
take
.
<EOS>
I
am
content
,
at
least
,
to
abide
by
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
""Snubbed
again
!
"
mentally
ejaculated
the
doctor
,
with
a
shrug
of
despair
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
useless
attempting
to
work
upon
such
impracticable
material
.
<EOS>
"Ranulph
remained
mute
,
in
an
attitude
of
profound
melancholy
.
<EOS>
An
eloquent
interchange
of
glances
had
passed
between
him
and
Eleanor
,
communicating
to
each
the
anxious
state
of
the
other
's
feelings
.
<EOS>
At
this
crisis
the
door
was
suddenly
opened
,
and
old
Agnes
,
Lady
Rookwood
's
aged
attendant
,
rushed
into
the
room
,
and
sank
upon
her
knees
on
the
floor
,
her
limbs
shaking
,
her
teeth
chattering
,
and
every
feature
expressive
of
intense
terror
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
went
instantly
towards
her
to
demand
the
cause
of
her
alarm
.
<EOS>
"No
,
let
me
pray
,
"
cried
Agnes
,
as
he
took
her
hand
in
the
attempt
to
raise
her
;
"
let
me
pray
while
there
is
yet
time
—
let
the
worthy
doctor
pray
beside
me
.
<EOS>
Pray
for
an
overladen
soul
,
sir
;
pray
heartily
,
as
you
would
hope
for
mercy
yourself
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
little
know
the
righteous
of
the
terrors
of
those
that
are
beyond
the
pale
of
mercy
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
pardon
me
my
iniquities
,
and
absolve
her
.
<EOS>
""Whom
<EOS>
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Ranulph
,
in
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
allude
to
my
mother?""You
have
no
longer
a
mother
,
young
man
,
"
said
Agnes
,
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"What
!
"
exclaimed
Ranulph
,
terror
-
stricken
;
<EOS>
"
is
she
dead?""She
is
gone
.
<EOS>
""Gone
!
<EOS>
How
?
<EOS>
Whither
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
all
,
their
amazement
increasing
each
instant
at
the
terror
of
the
old
woman
,
and
the
apparently
terrible
occasion
of
it
.
"Speak
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Ranulph
;
"
but
why
do
I
loiter
?
<EOS>
my
mother
,
perchance
,
is
dying
—
let
me
go
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
old
woman
maintained
her
clutching
grasp
,
which
was
strong
and
convulsive
as
that
of
one
struggling
betwixt
life
and
death
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
of
no
use
,
I
tell
you
;
it
's
all
over
,
"
said
she—"the
dead
are
come
—
the
dead
are
come
—
and
she
is
gone
.
<EOS>
""Whither?—whither?""To
the
grave
—
to
the
tomb
,
"
said
Agnes
,
in
a
deep
and
hollow
tone
,
and
with
a
look
that
froze
Ranulph
's
soul
.
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
me
,
Ranulph
Rookwood
,
my
child
,
my
nursling
—
listen
while
I
can
speak
.
<EOS>
We
were
alone
,
your
mother
and
I
,
after
that
scene
between
you
;
after
the
dark
denunciations
she
had
heaped
upon
the
dead
,
when
I
heard
a
low
and
gasping
kind
of
sob
,
and
there
I
saw
your
mother
staring
wildly
upon
the
vacancy
,
as
if
she
saw
that
of
which
I
dare
not
think
.
<EOS>
""What
think
you
she
beheld
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Ranulph
,
quaking
with
apprehension
.
<EOS>
"That
which
had
been
your
father
,
"
returned
Agnes
,
in
a
hollow
tone
.
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
doubt
me
,
sir
—
you'll
find
the
truth
of
what
I
say
anon
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
he
was
there
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
thrilling
,
speechless
horror
in
the
very
sight
of
her
countenance
that
froze
my
old
blood
to
ice
—
to
the
ice
in
which
'
tis
now
—
ough
!
<EOS>
ough
!
<EOS>
Well
,
at
length
she
arose
,
with
her
eyes
still
fixed
,
and
passed
through
the
paneled
door
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
She
is
gone!""What
madness
is
this
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
,
woman—'tis
that
ruffian
in
disguise
—
she
may
be
murdered
.
<EOS>
""No
,
no
,
"
shrieked
Agnes
;
"
it
was
no
disguise
.
<EOS>
She
is
gone
,
I
tell
you
—
the
room
was
empty
,
all
the
rooms
were
empty
—
the
passage
was
void
—
through
the
door
they
went
together
—
silently
,
silently
—
ghostlike
,
slow
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
that
tomb
—
they
are
there
together
now
—
he
has
her
in
his
arms
—
<EOS>
see
,
they
are
here
<EOS>
—
they
glide
through
the
door
—
do
you
not
see
them
now
?
<EOS>
Did
I
not
speak
the
truth
?
<EOS>
She
is
dead
—
ha
,
ha
!
"
<EOS>
And
with
a
frantic
and
bewildering
laugh
the
old
woman
fell
upon
her
face
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
raised
her
from
the
floor
;
but
the
shock
of
what
she
had
beheld
had
been
too
much
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
dead!CHAPTER

RANULPH
ROOKWOOD
was
for
some
moments
so
much
stunned
by
the
ghastly
fate
of
Agnes
,
connected
,
as
it
appeared
to
be
,
with
a
supernatural
summons
similar
to
that
which
he
imagined
he
had
himself
received
,
that
he
was
incapable
of
stirring
from
the
spot
,
or
removing
his
gaze
from
the
rigid
features
of
the
corpse
,
which
,
even
in
death
,
wore
the
strong
impress
of
horror
and
despair
.
<EOS>
Through
life
he
knew
that
Agnes
,
his
own
nurse
,
had
been
his
mother
's
constant
and
faithful
attendant
;
the
unhesitating
agent
of
her
schemes
,
and
it
was
to
be
feared
,
from
the
remorse
she
had
exhibited
,
the
participator
of
her
crimes
;
and
Ranulph
felt
,
he
knew
not
why
,
that
in
having
witnessed
her
terrible
end
,
he
beheld
the
ultimate
condition
of
his
own
parent
.
<EOS>
Conquering
,
not
without
great
effort
,
the
horror
which
had
riveted
him
to
the
spot
,
he
turned
to
look
towards
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
She
had
sunk
upon
a
chair
,
a
silent
witness
of
the
scene
,
Mrs.
Mowbray
and
Dr.
Small
having
,
upon
the
first
alarm
given
by
Agnes
respecting
Lady
Rookwood
's
departure
from
the
house
quitted
the
room
to
ascertain
the
truth
of
her
statement
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
immediately
flew
to
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"Ranulph
,
"
said
she
,
though
almost
overcome
by
her
alarm
,
"
stay
not
an
instant
here
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
from
that
poor
woman
's
dreadful
death
,
that
something
terrible
has
occurred
,
perhaps
to
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
Go
to
her
chamber
.
<EOS>
Tarry
not
<EOS>
,
I
entreat
of
you
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
will
you
,
can
you
remain
here
alone
with
that
body
?
"
asked
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"I
shall
not
be
alone
.
<EOS>
Handassah
is
within
call
—
<EOS>
nay
,
she
is
here
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
an
eve
of
our
espousals
has
this
been
,
dear
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
Our
whole
life
is
a
troubled
volume
,
of
which
each
successive
leaf
grows
darker
.
<EOS>
Fate
is
opposed
to
us
.
<EOS>
It
is
useless
to
contend
with
our
destiny
.
<EOS>
I
fear
we
shall
never
be
united
.
<EOS>
""Dismiss
<EOS>
me
not
with
words
like
those
,
dear
Eleanor
,
"
returned
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"
Fate
can
not
have
greater
woes
in
store
for
us
than
those
by
which
we
are
now
opposed
.
<EOS>
Let
us
hope
that
we
are
now
at
that
point
whence
all
must
brighten
.
<EOS>
Once
possessed
of
you
,
assured
of
thus
much
happiness
,
I
would
set
even
fate
at
defiance
.
<EOS>
And
you
will
be
mine
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
""Ranulph
,
dear
Ranulph
,
your
suit
at
this
moment
is
desperate
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
,
can
not
pledge
myself
.
<EOS>
You
yourself
heard
,
even
now
,
my
mother
's
sentiments
,
and
I
can
not
marry
without
her
consent
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
mother
,
like
my
own
,
regards
not
the
feelings
of
her
children
.
<EOS>
Forgive
my
boldness
,
Eleanor
;
forgive
me
if
I
linger
now
,
when
duty
calls
me
hence
;
but
I
can
not
tear
myself
away
.
<EOS>
Your
mother
may
return
—
my
hopes
be
crushed
;
for
even
your
love
for
me
seems
annihilated
in
her
presence
.
<EOS>
""Ranulph
,
your
vehemence
terrifies
me
,
"
rejoined
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"
I
implore
you
,
by
the
tender
affection
which
you
know
I
bear
you
,
not
to
urge
me
further
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
Recall
your
firmer
feelings
,
and
obtain
some
mastery
over
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
,
I
am
yours
only
,
if
I
am
bride
of
any
one
.
<EOS>
But
when
our
union
can
take
place
rests
not
with
myself
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
I
entreat
of
you
,
leave
me
.
<EOS>
""You
are
mine
,
"
said
Ranulph
,
with
fervor
;
"
mine
only
.
<EOS>
""Yours
<EOS>
only
,
"
replied
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
"Be
<EOS>
this
the
earnest
of
my
happiness
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Ranulph
,
imprinting
a
long
and
impassioned
kiss
upon
her
lips
.
<EOS>
The
lovers
were
startled
from
their
embrace
by
a
profound
sigh
;
it
proceeded
from
Handassah
,
who
,
unbidden
,
had
replaced
the
picture
of
the
Lady
Eleanor
upon
its
frame
.
<EOS>
The
augury
seemed
sinister
.
<EOS>
Every
one
who
has
gazed
steadfastly
upon
a
portrait
must
have
noticed
the
peculiar
and
lifelike
character
which
,
under
certain
aspects
,
the
eyes
will
assume
.
<EOS>
Seen
by
the
imperfect
light
upon
the
table
,
the
whole
character
of
the
countenance
of
the
Lady
Eleanor
seemed
changed
;
the
features
appeared
to
be
stamped
with
melancholy
,
and
the
eyes
to
be
fixed
with
pitying
tenderness
upon
her
descendants
.
<EOS>
Both
gazed
at
each
other
and
at
the
picture
,
struck
with
the
same
sentiment
of
undefined
awe
.
<EOS>
Beside
them
stood
the
dark
figure
of
the
gipsy
girl
,
watching
,
with
ill
-
concealed
satisfaction
,
the
effect
of
her
handiwork
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
was
aroused
from
his
abstraction
by
hearing
a
loud
outcry
in
Mrs.
Mowbray
's
voice
.
<EOS>
Hastily
committing
Eleanor
to
the
care
of
her
attendant
,
he
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
Handassah
followed
him
to
the
door
,
closed
it
after
him
,
and
then
locked
it
within
side
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
she
walked
back
hastily
towards
Eleanor
,
exclaiming
,
in
a
tone
of
exultation
,
"
You
have
parted
with
him
forever
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
mean
you
,
girl
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Eleanor
,
alarmed
at
her
manner
.
<EOS>
"
Why
have
you
fastened
the
door
?
<EOS>
Open
it
,
I
command
you
.
<EOS>
""Command
me
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
laughed
Handassah
,
scornfully
.
<EOS>
"
What
if
I
refuse
your
mandate
?
<EOS>
What
,
if
,
in
my
turn
,
I
bid
you
obey
me
?
<EOS>
I
never
owned
but
one
mistress
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
bowed
my
neck
to
you
for
a
time
,
'
twas
to
fulfil
her
dying
wishes
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
submitted
to
your
control
,
it
was
to
accomplish
what
I
have
now
accomplished
.
<EOS>
Your
oath
!
<EOS>
Remember
your
oath
.
<EOS>
The
hour
is
come
for
its
fulfilment
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
these
words
Handassah
clapped
her
hands
.
<EOS>
A
panel
in
the
wall
opened
,
and
Luke
stood
suddenly
before
them
.
<EOS>
Silently
and
with
stern
deliberation
he
strode
towards
Eleanor
,
and
seizing
one
of
her
hands
,
drew
her
forcibly
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
resisted
not
;
she
had
not
the
power
;
neither
did
she
scream
,
for
so
paralyzing
<EOS>
was
her
terror
,
that
for
the
moment
it
took
away
all
power
of
utterance
.
<EOS>
Luke
neither
stirred
nor
spoke
,
but
,
still
maintaining
his
hold
,
gazed
searchingly
upon
her
features
,
while
Eleanor
,
as
if
spell
-
bound
,
could
not
withdraw
her
eyes
from
him
.
<EOS>
Nothing
more
terribly
impressive
could
be
conceived
than
Luke
's
whole
appearance
.
<EOS>
Harassed
and
exhausted
by
the
life
he
had
recently
led
;
deprived
almost
of
natural
rest
;
goaded
by
remorse
,
his
frame
was
almost
worn
to
the
bone
,
while
his
countenance
,
once
dark
and
swarthy
,
was
now
blanched
and
colorless
as
marble
.
<EOS>
This
pallid
and
deathlike
hue
was
,
in
all
probability
,
owing
to
the
loss
of
blood
he
had
sustained
from
the
wound
inflicted
by
Major
Mowbray
,
with
the
stains
of
which
his
apparel
was
dyed
;
for
,
though
staunched
,
the
effusion
had
been
sufficient
to
cause
great
faintness
.
<EOS>
His
dark
eyes
blazed
with
their
wonted
fire
—
nay
,
they
looked
darker
and
larger
from
his
exceeding
paleness
,
and
such
intense
mental
and
bodily
suffering
was
imprinted
upon
his
countenance
,
that
,
despite
its
fierceness
and
desperation
,
few
could
have
regarded
him
without
sympathy
.
<EOS>
Real
desperation
has
so
much
of
agony
in
its
character
,
that
no
one
can
witness
it
unmoved
.
<EOS>
His
garb
was
not
that
in
which
the
reader
first
beheld
him
,
but
a
rich
,
dark
,
simple
suit
of
velvet
,
corresponding
more
with
his
real
rank
in
life
than
his
former
peasant
's
attire
;
but
it
was
disordered
by
his
recent
conflict
,
and
stained
with
bloody
testimonials
of
the
fray
;
while
his
long
,
sable
curls
,
once
his
pride
and
ornament
,
now
hung
in
intertangled
elf
-
locks
,
like
a
coil
of
wreathed
water
-
snakes
.
<EOS>
Even
in
her
terror
,
as
she
dwelt
upon
his
noble
features
,
Eleanor
could
not
help
admitting
that
she
beheld
the
undoubted
descendant
,
and
the
living
likeness
of
the
handsomest
and
most
distinguished
of
her
house
—
the
profligate
and
criminal
Sir
Reginald
.
<EOS>
As
her
eye
,
mechanically
following
this
train
of
thought
,
wandered
for
an
instant
to
the
haughty
portraiture
of
Sir
Reginald
,
which
formed
part
of
the
family
pictures
,
and
thence
to
those
of
his
unfortunate
lady
,
she
was
struck
with
the
fancy
that
,
by
some
terrible
fatality
,
the
tragic
horrors
of
bygone
days
were
to
be
again
enacted
in
their
persons
,
and
that
they
were
in
some
way
strangely
identified
with
their
unfortunate
progenitors
.
<EOS>
So
forcibly
was
this
idea
impressed
upon
her
features
that
Luke
,
who
had
followed
the
direction
of
her
glances
,
became
instantly
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
Drawing
her
nearer
to
the
portrait
of
the
Lady
Eleanor
,
he
traced
the
resemblance
in
mute
wonder
;
thence
,
<EOS>
turning
towards
that
of
Sir
Reginald
,
he
proudly
exclaimed
:
"
You
doubted
once
my
lineage
,
maiden
—
can
you
gaze
on
those
features
,
which
would
almost
seem
to
be
a
reflection
of
mine
own
,
and
longer
hesitate
whose
descendant
I
am
?
<EOS>
I
glory
in
my
likeness
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
wild
delight
in
setting
human
emotions
at
naught
,
which
he
was
said
to
feel
—
which
I
feel
now
.
<EOS>
Within
these
halls
I
seem
to
breathe
an
atmosphere
congenial
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
visit
what
I
oft
have
visited
in
my
dreams
;
or
as
in
a
state
of
pre
-
existence
.
<EOS>
Methinks
,
as
I
gaze
on
you
<EOS>
,
I
could
almost
deem
myself
Sir
Reginald
,
and
you
his
bride
,
the
Lady
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
Our
fates
were
parallel
:
she
was
united
to
her
lord
by
ties
of
hatred
—
by
a
vow
—
a
bridal
vow
!
<EOS>
So
are
you
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
she
could
ne'er
escape
him
—
could
ne'er
throw
off
her
bondage
—
nor
shall
you
.
<EOS>
I
claim
the
fulfilment
of
your
oath
;
you
are
mine
.
<EOS>
""Never
,
never
!
"
shrieked
Eleanor
,
<EOS>
struggling
to
disengage
herself
.
<EOS>
But
Luke
laughed
at
her
feeble
efforts
.
<EOS>
Handassah
stood
by
,
a
passive
spectatress
of
the
scene
,
with
her
arms
folded
upon
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
refuse
compliance
,
"
said
Luke
,
scornfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
no
hopes
of
Heaven
,
no
fears
of
perdition
,
that
you
dare
to
violate
your
vow
?
<EOS>
Bethink
you
of
the
awful
nature
of
that
obligation
;
of
the
life
that
was
laid
down
to
purchase
it
;
of
the
blood
which
will
cry
out
for
vengeance
'
gainst
the
murderess
,
should
you
hesitate
.
<EOS>
By
that
blood
-
cemented
sacrament
,
I
claim
you
as
my
own
.
<EOS>
You
are
mine
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
dragged
her
towards
the
opening
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
uttered
a
long
and
terrific
scream
.
<EOS>
"Be
<EOS>
silent
,
on
your
life
,
"
added
he
,
searching
for
the
dagger
given
to
him
by
Alan
Rookwood
,
when
,
as
his
hand
sought
the
weapon
,
Eleanor
escaped
from
his
grasp
,
and
fled
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
But
Handassah
had
anticipated
her
intention
.
<EOS>
The
key
was
withdrawn
from
the
lock
,
and
the
wretched
maiden
vainly
tried
to
open
it
.
<EOS>
At
this
instant
Turpin
appeared
at
the
sliding
panel
.
<EOS>
"Quick
,
quick
!
"
<EOS>
cried
he
,
impatiently—"despatch
,
in
the
devil
's
name
.
<EOS>
The
house
is
alarmed
.
<EOS>
I
hear
young
Ranulph
's
voice
in
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
""Ranulph
!
<EOS>
"
shrieked
Eleanor—"then
I
am
saved
,
"
and
she
redoubled
her
outcries
for
assistance
.
<EOS>
Luke
again
seized
his
victim
.
<EOS>
Her
hands
clutched
so
convulsively
fast
in
her
despairing
energy
against
the
handle
of
the
door
that
he
could
not
tear
her
thence
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
Ranulph
Rookwood
,
who
had
caught
her
reiterated
screams
for
help
,
was
at
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
He
heard
her
struggles
;
he
heard
Luke
's
threats
—
his
mockery
—
his
derisive
laughter
—
but
vainly
,
vainly
did
he
attempt
to
force
it
open
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
the
strongest
oak
,
and
the
bolts
resisted
all
his
efforts
.
<EOS>
A
board
alone
divided
him
from
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
He
could
hear
her
sobs
and
gasps
.
<EOS>
He
saw
,
from
the
action
of
the
handle
,
with
what
tenacity
she
clung
to
it
;
and
,
stung
to
frenzy
by
the
sight
,
he
hurled
himself
against
the
sturdy
plank
,
but
all
in
vain
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
handle
was
still
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
heavy
fall
upon
the
floor
—
a
stifled
scream
—
and
a
sound
as
of
a
body
being
dragged
along
.
<EOS>
The
thought
was
madness
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
the
panel
!
<EOS>
to
the
panel
!
"
cried
a
voice
—
it
was
that
of
Turpin
—
from
within
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
panel!—ha
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Ranulph
,
with
a
sudden
gleam
of
hope
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
yet
save
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
darted
along
the
corridor
with
the
swiftness
of
thought
.
<EOS>
Luke
,
meanwhile
,
had
for
some
minutes
fruitlessly
exhausted
all
his
force
to
drag
Eleanor
from
the
door
.
<EOS>
Despair
gave
her
strength
;
she
clutched
at
the
door
;
but
she
felt
her
strength
failing
her
—
her
grasp
was
relaxing
.
<EOS>
And
then
the
maddening
thought
that
she
would
be
shortly
his
—
that
he
would
slay
her
—
while
the
idea
that
Ranulph
was
so
near
,
and
yet
unable
to
protect
her
,
added
gall
even
to
her
bitterness
.
<EOS>
With
savage
delight
Luke
exulted
in
the
lovers
'
tortures
.
<EOS>
He
heard
Ranulph
's
ineffectual
attempts
;
he
heard
his
groans
;
he
heard
their
mutual
cries
.
<EOS>
Inflamed
by
jealousy
,
he
triumphed
in
his
power
of
vengeance
,
and
even
prolonged
the
torture
which
accident
had
given
him
the
means
of
inflicting
.
<EOS>
He
stood
like
the
inquisitor
who
marks
his
victim
's
anguish
on
the
rack
,
and
calculates
his
powers
of
further
endurance
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
no
longer
dally
,
even
with
this
horrible
gratification
.
<EOS>
His
companion
grew
impatient
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
's
fair
long
tresses
had
escaped
from
their
confinement
in
the
struggle
,
and
fell
down
her
neck
in
disorder
.
<EOS>
Twining
his
fingers
amidst
its
folds
,
Luke
dragged
her
backwards
from
her
hold
,
and
,
incapable
of
further
resistance
,
her
strength
completely
exhausted
,
the
wretched
girl
fell
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Luke
now
raised
her
almost
inanimate
form
in
his
arms
,
and
had
nigh
reached
the
aperture
,
when
a
crash
was
heard
in
the
panel
opposite
to
that
by
which
he
was
about
to
escape
,
and
communicating
with
a
further
apartment
.
<EOS>
It
was
thrown
open
,
and
Ranulph
Rookwood
presented
himself
at
the
narrow
partition
.
<EOS>
An
exclamation
of
joy
,
that
he
was
yet
in
time
,
escaped
his
lips
;
and
he
was
about
to
clear
the
partition
at
a
bound
,
and
to
precipitate
himself
upon
Luke
,
when
,
as
suddenly
as
his
own
action
,
was
the
person
of
the
unfortunate
Mr.
Coates
wedged
into
the
aperture
.
"Traitor
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ranulph
,
regarding
Coates
with
concentrated
fury
,
"
dare
you
to
oppose
me?—hence
!
<EOS>
or
,
by
Heaven
,
I
will
cut
you
down!""'Tis
impossible
,
"
ejaculated
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
"
For
your
own
sake
,
Sir
Ranulph
—
for
my
sake
—
I
entreat
—
implore
of
you
—
not
to
attempt
to
pass
this
way
.
<EOS>
Try
the
other
door
.
<EOS>
"Ranulph
said
no
more
.
<EOS>
He
passed
his
sword
through
the
body
of
the
miserable
attorney
,
who
,
with
a
deep
groan
,
fell
.
<EOS>
The
only
obstacle
to
his
passage
being
thus
removed
,
he
at
once
leaped
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
brothers
were
now
confronted
,
together
,
but
little
of
brotherly
love
mingled
with
the
glances
which
they
threw
upon
each
other
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
's
gentle
,
but
withal
enthusiastic
temperament
,
had
kindled
,
under
his
present
excitement
,
like
flax
at
the
sudden
approach
of
flame
.
<EOS>
He
was
wild
with
frenzy
.
<EOS>
Luke
was
calmer
,
but
his
fury
was
deadly
and
inextinguishable
.
<EOS>
The
meeting
was
terrible
on
both
sides
.
<EOS>
With
one
arm
Luke
enfolded
Eleanor
,
with
the
other
he
uplifted
the
dagger
.
<EOS>
Its
point
was
towards
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
Scowling
grim
defiance
at
Ranulph
,
he
exclaimed
,
in
a
determined
tone
,
"
Advance
a
footstep
,
and
my
dagger
descends
into
her
heart
.
<EOS>
"Ranulph
<EOS>
hesitated
,
uncertain
how
to
act
;
foaming
with
rage
,
yet
trembling
with
apprehension
.
<EOS>
"Ranulph
,
"
gasped
Eleanor
,
"
life
without
you
were
valueless
.
<EOS>
Advance
—
avenge
me!"Ranulph
still
hesitated
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
by
any
act
of
his
own
,
compromise
Eleanor
's
safety
.
<EOS>
Luke
saw
his
advantage
,
and
was
not
slow
to
profit
by
it
.
<EOS>
"
You
seal
her
destruction
if
you
stir
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"Villain
,
"
returned
Ranulph
,
between
his
ground
teeth
,
and
with
difficulty
commanding
sufficient
coolness
to
speak
with
deliberation
,
"
you
perceive
your
power
.
<EOS>
Injure
her
,
and
nothing
earthly
shall
protect
you
.
<EOS>
Free
her
,
and
take
your
life
and
liberty
;
nay
,
reward
if
you
will
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
otherwise
escape
me
.
<EOS>
""Escape
you
!
"
laughed
Luke
,
disdainfully
.
"
<EOS>
Stand
aside
,
and
let
me
pass
.
<EOS>
Beware
,
"
added
he
,
sternly
,
"
how
you
oppose
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
a
brother
's
blood
upon
my
soul
.
<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
I
,
"
cried
Ranulph
;
"
but
you
pass
not
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
placed
himself
full
in
Luke
's
path
.
<EOS>
Luke
,
however
,
steadily
moved
forward
,
holding
Eleanor
between
himself
and
Ranulph
,
so
as
to
shield
his
own
person
;
but
,
fancying
he
saw
an
opportunity
of
dealing
a
blow
without
injury
to
his
mistress
,
the
latter
was
about
to
hazard
the
thrust
,
when
his
arms
were
seized
behind
,
and
he
was
rendered
powerless
.
<EOS>
"Lost
,
lost
,
"
<EOS>
groaned
he
;
"
she
is
lost
to
me
forever!""I
<EOS>
fear
that
's
but
too
true
,
"
said
Turpin
,
<EOS>
for
it
was
the
highwayman
whose
grasp
confined
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
"Must
<EOS>
I
see
her
borne
away
before
my
eyes
?
"
cried
Ranulph
.
"
<EOS>
Release
me
—
set
me
free!""Quite
impossible
at
present
,
"
returned
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mount
and
away
,
Sir
Luke
,
"
continued
he
;
"
never
mind
me
.
<EOS>
Leave
me
to
shift
for
myself
.
<EOS>
""Eleanor
!
"
cried
Ranulph
,
as
she
passed
close
by
his
side
.
"Ranulph
!
<EOS>
"
shrieked
Eleanor
,
with
a
loud
scream
,
recalled
to
consciousness
by
his
voice
,
"
farewell
for
ever
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
for
ever
,
"
responded
Luke
,
triumphantly
.
<EOS>
"
You
meet
no
more
on
earth
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
was
about
to
pass
through
the
panel
,
when
Eleanor
exerted
all
her
remaining
strength
in
a
last
futile
attempt
at
liberation
.
<EOS>
In
the
struggle
,
a
packet
fell
from
Luke
's
bosom
.
<EOS>
Handassah
stooped
to
pick
it
up
.
<EOS>
"From
Sybil
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
she
,
glancing
at
the
superscription
.
<EOS>
"Remember
<EOS>
my
promise
to
old
Barbara
,
"
roared
Dick
,
who
had
some
curiosity
,
as
the
reader
knows
,
to
learn
what
the
package
contained
.
<EOS>
"
The
time
is
arrived
.
<EOS>
Eleanor
is
in
your
power
—
in
your
presence
.
<EOS>
""Give
me
<EOS>
the
packet
,
"
said
Luke
,
resigning
Eleanor
for
the
instant
to
Handassah
's
custody—"take
the
steel
,
and
grasp
her
firmly
.
<EOS>
"Handassah
,
who
,
though
slight
of
figure
,
was
of
singular
personal
strength
,
twined
her
arms
about
Miss
Mowbray
in
such
a
manner
as
to
preclude
all
possibility
of
motion
.
<EOS>
Luke
tore
open
the
package
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
box
carefully
enclosed
in
several
folds
of
linen
,
and
lastly
within
a
sheet
of
paper
,
on
which
were
inscribed
these
words
:
The
Dower
of
SybilHastily
,
and
with
much
curiosity
,
Luke
raised
the
lid
of
the
box
.
<EOS>
It
contained
one
long
silken
tress
of
blackest
hair
enviously
braided
.
<EOS>
It
was
Sybil
's
.
<EOS>
His
first
impulse
was
to
cast
it
from
him
;
<EOS>
his
next
,
reproachfully
to
raise
it
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
He
started
as
if
a
snake
had
stung
him
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
loud
clamor
was
heard
in
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
In
the
next
,
the
door
was
assailed
by
violent
strokes
,
evidently
proceeding
from
some
weighty
instrument
,
impelled
by
the
united
strength
of
several
assailants
.
<EOS>
The
voice
of
Turpin
rose
above
the
deafening
din
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
bullet
for
the
first
who
enters
,
"
shouted
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quick
,
Sir
Luke
,
and
the
prize
is
safe
—
away
,
and——"But
as
he
seconded
his
exhortation
with
a
glance
at
Luke
,
he
broke
off
the
half
-
uttered
sentence
,
and
started
with
horror
and
amazement
.
<EOS>
Ere
the
cause
of
his
alarm
could
be
expressed
,
the
door
was
burst
open
,
and
a
crowd
of
domestics
,
headed
by
Major
Mowbray
and
Titus
Tyrconnel
,
rushed
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
"Nay
,
then
,
the
game
's
up
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Dick
;
"
I
have
done
with
Rookwood
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
springing
through
the
panel
,
he
was
seen
no
more
.
<EOS>
When
the
newcomers
first
looked
round
,
they
could
perceive
only
two
figures
besides
themselves
—
those
of
the
two
lovers
—
Eleanor
having
sunk
pale
,
exhausted
,
and
almost
senseless
,
into
the
arms
of
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
however
,
a
ghastly
object
attracted
their
attention
.
<EOS>
All
rushed
towards
it
—
all
recoiled
,
as
soon
as
they
discovered
that
it
was
the
lifeless
body
of
Luke
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
His
limbs
were
stiff
,
like
those
of
a
corpse
which
has
for
hours
been
such
;
his
eyes
protruded
from
their
sockets
;
his
face
was
livid
and
blotched
.
<EOS>
All
bespoke
,
with
terrible
certainty
,
the
efficacy
of
the
poison
,
and
the
full
accomplishment
of
Barbara
's
revenge
.
<EOS>
Handassah
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Probably
she
had
escaped
ere
Turpin
fled
.
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
she
was
heard
of
no
more
at
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
It
required
little
to
recall
the
senses
of
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
Shortly
she
revived
,
and
as
she
gazed
around
,
and
became
conscious
of
her
escape
,
she
uttered
exclamations
of
thanksgiving
,
and
sank
into
the
embraces
of
her
brother
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Mrs.
Mowbray
and
Dr.
Small
had
joined
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
The
worthy
doctor
had
been
full
of
alarm
;
but
his
meditated
condolences
were
now
changed
to
congratulations
,
as
he
heard
the
particulars
of
the
terrible
scene
that
had
occurred
,
and
of
Eleanor
's
singular
and
almost
providential
deliverance
.
<EOS>
"After
<EOS>
what
has
befallen
,
madam
,
"
said
the
doctor
to
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
slightly
coughing
,
"
you
can
no
longer
raise
any
objection
to
a
certain
union
,

the

I

hereafter
detail

<EOS>
Suffice
it
to
say
,
that

for

fortunate
arrival

"
added
he
,
looking
at
Titus
Tyrconnel
,
"
at
the
hut
on
Thorne
Waste
,
I
might
have
been
detained
a
prisoner
,
without
parole
,
and
,
what
is
worse
,
without
provision
perhaps
for
days
;
and
to
add
to
my
distress
,
fully
acquainted
with
the
meditated
abduction
of
my
sister
.
<EOS>
It
was
excessively
lucky
for
me
,
Mr.
Tyrconnel
,
that
you
happened
to
pass
that
way
,
and
for
poor
Paterson
likewise
.
<EOS>
""Arrah
,
by
my
sowl

major

and
you
may
say
that
with
safety

and
it
was
particularly
fortunate
that
we
stumbled
upon
the
tits
in
the
cellar
,
or
we
'd
never
have
been
here
just
in
the
nick
of
it

<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
we
've
lost
all
chance
of
taking
Dick
Turpin
this
time

<EOS>
He
's
got
clean
away

<EOS>
""I
am
not

his

said
the
major
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
a
brave
fellow
;
and
I
respect
courage
wherever
I
find
it
,
even
in
a
highwayman

<EOS>
I
should
be
sorry
to
appear
as
a
witness
against
him

I
trust
it
will
never
be
my
fate
to
do
so

<EOS>
"We
shall
not
pause
to
describe
the
affectionate
meeting
which
now
ensued
between
the
brother

—
the
congratulations
upon
Eleanor

escape
from
peril
,
intermingled
with
the
tenderest
embraces

the
warmest
thanks
offered
to

his
gallant
service

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She

the

and
though
you

I
predict

contrary

""My

starting

"Make

he

half
aside

is
,
that

""One

welcomed
the
facetious
man
of
law
with
no
little
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
We
think
it
unnecessary
to
enter
into
further
detail
.
<EOS>
Another
chamber
was
prepared
for
Eleanor
's
reception
,
to
which
she
was
almost
immediately
transported
.
<EOS>
The
remains
of
the
once
fierce
and
haughty
Luke
,
now
stiff
and
stark
,
but
still
wearing
,
even
in
death
,
their
proud
character
,
were
placed
upon
the
self
-
same
bier
,
and
covered
with
the
self
-
same
pall
which
,
but
a
week
ago
,
had
furnished
forth
his
father
's
funeral
.
<EOS>
And
as
the
domestics
crowded
round
the
corpse
,
there
was
not
one
of
them
but
commented
upon
his
startling
resemblance
to
his
grandsire
,
Sir
Reginald
;
nor
,
amongst
the
superstitious
,
was
the
falling
of
the
fatal
bough
forgotten
.
<EOS>
Tranquillity
was
at
length
restored
at
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Throughout
the
night
and
during
the
next
day
,
Ranulph
made
every
search
for
his
mother
,
but
no
tidings
could
be
learned
of
her
.
<EOS>
Seriously
alarmed
,
he
then
caused
more
strict
and
general
inquiry
to
be
instituted
,
but
with
like
unsuccessful
effect
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
,
indeed
,
till
some
years
afterwards
that
her
fate
was
ascertained

<EOS>
NOTWITHSTANDING
the
obscurity
which
hung
over
the
fate
of
Lady
Rookwood
,
the
celebration
of
the
nuptials
of
Sir
Ranulph
and
Eleanor
was
not
long
delayed
;
the
ceremony
took
place
at
the
parish
church
,
and
the
worthy
vicar
officiated
upon
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
joyous
sight
to
all
who
witnessed
it
,
and
not
few
were
they
who
did
so
,
for
the
whole
neighborhood
was
bidden
to
the
festival
.
<EOS>
The
old
avenue
was
thronged
with
bright
and
beaming
faces
,
rustic
maidens
decked
out
in
ribbons
of
many
-
colored
splendor
,
and
stout
youths
in
their
best
holiday
trim
;
nor
was
the
lusty
yeoman
and
his
buxom
spouse
—
nor
yet
the
patriarch
of
the
village
,
nor
prattling
child
,
wanting
.
<EOS>
Even
the
ancestral
rooks
seemed
to
participate
in
the
universal
merriment
,
and
returned
,
from
their
eyries
,
a
hoarse
greeting
,
like
a
lusty
chorus
of
laughter
,
to
the
frolic
train
.
<EOS>
The
churchyard
path
was
strewn
with
flowers
—
the
church
itself
a
complete
garland
.
<EOS>
Never
was
there
seen
a
blither
wedding
:
the
sun
smiled
upon
the
bride
—
accounted
a
fortunate
omen
,
as
dark
lowering
skies
and
stormy
weather
had
,
within
the
memory
of
the
oldest
of
the
tenantry
,
inauspiciously
ushered
in
all
former
espousals
.
<EOS>
The
bride
had
recovered
her
bloom
and
beauty
,
while
the
melancholy
which
had
seemingly
settled
for
ever
upon
the
open
brow
of
the
bridegroom
,
had
now
given
place
to
a
pensive
shade
that
only
added
interest
to
his
expressive
features
;
and
,
as
in
simple
state
,
after
the
completion
of
the
sacred
rites
,
the
youthful
pair
walked
,
arm
in
arm
,
amongst
their
thronging
and
admiring
tenants
towards
the
Hall
,
many
a
fervent
prayer
was
breathed
that
the
curse
of
the
house
of
Rookwood
might
be
averted
from
their
heads
;
and
,
not
to
leave
a
doubt
upon
the
subject
,
we
can
add
that
these
aspirations
were
not
in
vain
,
but
that
the
day
,
which
dawned
so
brightly
,
was
one
of
serene
and
unclouded
happiness
to
its
close
.
<EOS>
After
the
ceremonial
,
the
day
was
devoted
to
festivity
.
<EOS>
Crowded
with
company
,
from
the
ample
hall
to
the
kitchen
ingle
,
the
old
mansion
could
scarce
contain
its
numerous
guests
,
while
the
walls
resounded
with
hearty
peals
of
laughter
,
to
which
they
had
been
long
unaccustomed
.
<EOS>
The
tables
groaned
beneath
the
lordly
baron
of
beef
,
the
weighty
chine
,
the
castled
pasty
flanked
on
the
one
hand
with
neat
's
tongue
,
and
on
the
other
defended
by
a
mountainous
ham
,
an
excellent
pièce
de
résistance
,
and
every
other
substantial
appliance
of
ancient
hospitality
.
<EOS>
Barrels
of
mighty
ale
were
broached
,
and
their
nut
-
brown
contents
widely
distributed
,
and
the
health
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
was
enthusiastically
drunk
in
a
brimming
wassail
cup
of
spicy
wine
with
floating
toast
.
<EOS>
Titus
Tyrconnel
acted
as
master
of
the
ceremonies
,
and
was
,
Mr.
Coates
declared
,
"
quite
in
his
element
.
"
<EOS>
So
much
was
he
elated
,
that
he
ventured
to
cut
some
of
his
old
jokes
upon
the
vicar
,
and
,
strange
to
say
,
without
incurring
the
resentment
of
Small
.
<EOS>
To
retrace
the
darker
course
of
our
narrative
,
we
must
state
that
some
weeks
before
this
happy
event
the
remains
of
the
unfortunate
Sir
Luke
Rookwood
had
been
gathered
to
those
of
his
fathers
.
<EOS>
The
document
that
attested
his
legitimacy
being
found
upon
his
person
,
the
claims
denied
to
him
in
life
were
conceded
in
death
;
and
he
was
interred
,
with
all
the
pomp
and
peculiar
solemnity
proper
to
one
of
the
house
,
within
the
tomb
of
his
ancestry
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
that
a
discovery
was
made
respecting
Alan
Rookwood
,
in
order
to
explain
which
we
must
again
revert
to
the
night
of
the
meditated
enlèvement
of
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
After
quitting
his
grandson
in
the
avenue
,
Alan
shaped
his
course
among
the
fields
in
the
direction
to
the
church
.
<EOS>
He
sought
his
own
humble
,
but
now
deserted
dwelling
.
<EOS>
The
door
had
been
forced
;
some
of
its
meagre
furniture
was
removed
;
and
the
dog
,
his
sole
companion
,
had
fled
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Mole
!
"
said
he
,
"
thou
hast
found
,
I
trust
,
a
better
master
.
"
<EOS>
And
having
possessed
himself
of
what
he
came
in
search
—
namely
,
a
bunch
of
keys
and
his
lantern
,
deposited
in
an
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
cupboard
,
that
had
escaped
notice
,
he
quickly
departed
.
<EOS>
He
was
once
more
within
the
churchyard
;
once
more
upon
that
awful
stage
whereon
he
had
chosen
to
enact
,
for
a
long
season
,
his
late
fantastical
character
;
and
he
gazed
upon
the
church
tower
,
glistening
in
the
moonshine
,
the
green
and
undulating
hillocks
,
the
"
chequered
cross
-
sticks
,
"
the
clustered
headstones
,
and
the
black
and
portentous
yew
-
trees
,
as
upon
"
old
familiar
faces
.
"
<EOS>
He
mused
,
for
a
few
moments
,
upon
the
scene
,
apparently
with
deep
interest
.
<EOS>
He
then
walked
beneath
the
shadows
of
one
of
the
yews
,
chanting
an
odd
stanza
or
so
of
one
of
his
wild
staves
,
wrapped
the
while
,
it
would
seem
,
in
affectionate
contemplation
of
the
subject
-
matter
of
his
song
:
<EOS>
THE
CHURCHYARD
YEW

<EOS>
A
noxious
tree
is
the
churchyard
yew
,
As
if
from
the
dead
its
sap
<EOS>
it
drew;Dark
<EOS>
are
its
branches
,
and
dismal
to
see
,
Like
plumes
at
Death
's
latest
solemnity
.
<EOS>
Spectral
and
jagged
,
and
black
as
the
wingsWhich
some
spirit
of
ill
o'er
a
sepulchre
flings
:
<EOS>
Oh
!
a
terrible
tree
is
the
churchyard
<EOS>
yew;Like
<EOS>
it
is
nothing
so
grimly
to
view
.
<EOS>
Yet
this
baleful
tree
hath
<EOS>
a
core
so
sound
,
Can
nought
so
tough
in
the
grove
<EOS>
be
found;From
it
were
fashioned
brave
English
bows
,
The
boast
of
our
isle
,
and
the
dread
of
its
foes
.
<EOS>
For
our
sturdy
sires
cut
their
stoutest
stavesFrom
<EOS>
the
branch
that
hung
o'er
<EOS>
their
fathers
'
graves;And
though
it
be
dreary
and
dismal
to
view
<EOS>
,
Staunch
at
the
heart
is
the
churchyard
yew
.
<EOS>
His
ditty
concluded
,
Alan
entered
the
churchyard
,
taking
care
to
leave
the
door
slightly
ajar
,
in
order
to
facilitate
his
grandson
's
entrance
.
<EOS>
For
an
instant
he
lingered
in
the
chancel
.
<EOS>
The
yellow
moonlight
fell
upon
the
monuments
of
his
race
;
and
,
directed
by
the
instinct
of
hate
<EOS>
,
Alan
's
eye
rested
upon
the
gilded
entablature
of
his
perfidious
brother
,
Reginald
,
and
,
muttering
curses
,
"
not
loud
but
deep
,
"
he
passed
on
.
<EOS>
Having
lighted
his
lantern
in
no
tranquil
mood
,
he
descended
into
the
vault
,
observing
a
similar
caution
with
respect
to
the
portal
of
the
cemetery
,
which
he
left
partially
unclosed
,
with
the
key
in
the
lock
.
<EOS>
Here
he
resolved
to
abide
Luke
's
coming
.
<EOS>
The
reader
knows
what
probability
there
was
of
his
expectations
being
realized
.
<EOS>
For
a
while
he
paced
the
tomb
,
wrapped
in
gloomy
meditation
,
and
pondering
,
it
might
be
,
upon
the
result
of
Luke
's
expedition
,
and
the
fulfilment
of
his
own
dark
schemes
,
scowling
from
time
to
time
beneath
his
bent
eyebrows
,
counting
the
grim
array
of
coffins
,
and
noticing
,
with
something
like
satisfaction
,
that
the
shell
which
contained
the
remains
of
his
daughter
had
been
restored
to
its
former
position
.
<EOS>
He
then
bethought
him
of
Father
Checkley
's
midnight
intrusion
upon
his
conference
with
Luke
,
and
their
apprehension
of
a
supernatural
visitation
,
and
his
curiosity
was
stimulated
to
ascertain
by
what
means
the
priest
had
gained
admission
to
the
spot
unperceived
and
unheard
.
<EOS>
He
resolved
to
sound
the
floor
,
and
see
whether
any
secret
entrance
existed
;
and
hollowly
and
dully
did
the
hard
flagging
return
the
stroke
of
his
heel
as
he
pursued
his
scrutiny
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
metallic
ringing
of
an
iron
plate
,
immediately
behind
the
marble
effigy
of
Sir
Ranulph
,
resolved
the
point
.
<EOS>
There
it
was
that
the
priest
had
found
access
to
the
vault
;
but
Alan
's
disappointment
was
excessive
,
when
he
discovered
that
the
plate
was
fastened
on
the
underside
,
and
all
communication
thence
with
the
churchyard
,
or
to
wherever
else
it
might
conduct
him
,
cut
off
:
but
the
present
was
not
the
season
for
further
investigation
,
and
tolerably
pleased
with
the
discovery
he
had
already
made
,
he
returned
to
his
silent
march
round
the
sepulchre
.
<EOS>
At
length
a
sound
,
like
the
sudden
shutting
of
the
church
door
,
broke
upon
the
profound
stillness
of
the
holy
edifice
.
<EOS>
In
the
hush
that
succeeded
,
a
footstep
was
distinctly
heard
threading
the
aisle
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
comes
—
he
comes
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Alan
,
joyfully
;
adding
,
an
instant
after
,
in
an
altered
voice
,
"
but
he
comes
alone
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
footstep
drew
near
to
the
mouth
of
the
vault
<EOS>
—
it
was
upon
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
Alan
stepped
forward
to
greet
,
as
he
supposed
,
his
grandson
,
but
started
back
in
astonishment
and
dismay
as
he
encountered
in
his
stead
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
Alan
retreated
,
while
the
lady
advanced
,
swinging
the
iron
door
after
her
,
which
closed
with
a
tremendous
clang
.
<EOS>
Approaching
the
statue
of
the
first
Sir
Ranulph
,
she
paused
,
and
Alan
then
remarked
the
singular
and
terrible
expression
of
her
eyes
,
which
appeared
to
be
fixed
upon
the
statue
,
or
upon
some
invisible
object
near
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
her
whole
attitude
and
manner
calculated
to
impress
the
deepest
terror
on
the
beholder
.
<EOS>
And
Alan
gazed
upon
her
with
an
awe
which
momently
increased
.
<EOS>
Lady
Rookwood
's
bearing
was
as
proud
and
erect
as
we
have
formerly
described
it
to
have
been
—
her
brow
was
haughtily
bent
—
her
chiselled
lip
as
disdainfully
curled
;
but
the
staring
,
changeless
eye
,
and
the
deep
-
heaved
sob
which
occasionally
escaped
her
,
betrayed
how
much
she
was
under
the
influence
of
mortal
terror
.
<EOS>
Alan
watched
her
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
He
knew
not
how
the
scene
was
likely
to
terminate
,
nor
what
could
have
induced
her
to
visit
this
ghostly
spot
at
such
an
hour
,
and
alone
;
but
he
resolved
to
abide
the
issue
in
silence
—
profound
as
her
own
.
<EOS>
After
a
time
,
however
,
his
impatience
got
the
better
of
his
fears
and
scruples
,
and
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
"What
doth
Lady
Rookwood
in
the
abode
of
the
dead
?
"
<EOS>
asked
he
,
at
length
.
<EOS>
She
started
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
but
still
kept
her
eye
fixed
upon
the
vacancy
.
<EOS>
"Hast
thou
not
beckoned
me
hither
,
and
am
I
not
come
?
<EOS>
"
returned
she
,
in
a
hollow
tone
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
thou
asketh
wherefore
I
am
here
<EOS>
—
I
am
here
because
,
as
in
thy
life
I
feared
thee
not
,
neither
in
death
do
I
fear
thee
.
<EOS>
I
am
here
because——""What
seest
thou
?
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Peter
,
with
ill
-
suppressed
terror
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
see
I
—
ha
—
ha
!
<EOS>
"
shouted
Lady
Rookwood
,
amidst
discordant
laughter
;
"
that
which
might
appal
a
heart
less
stout
than
mine
—
a
figure
anguish
-
writhen
,
with
veins
that
glow
as
with
a
subtle
and
consuming
flame
.
<EOS>
A
substance
yet
a
shadow
,
in
thy
living
likeness
.
<EOS>
Ha
—
frown
if
thou
wilt
;
I
can
return
thy
glances
.
<EOS>
""Where
<EOS>
dost
thou
see
this
vision
?
"
demanded
Alan
.
<EOS>
"Where
!
"
echoed
Lady
Rookwood
,
becoming
for
the
first
time
sensible
of
the
presence
of
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
—
who
are
you
that
question
<EOS>
me?—what
are
you?—speak!""No
matter
who
or
what
I
am
,
"
returned
Alan
,
"
<EOS>
I
ask
you
what
you
behold
.
<EOS>
""Can
<EOS>
you
see
nothing?""Nothing
,
"
replied
Alan
.
<EOS>
"You
knew
Sir
Piers
<EOS>
Rookwood?""Is
it
<EOS>
he
?
"
asked
Alan
,
drawing
near
her
.
<EOS>
"It
is
,
"
replied
Lady
Rookwood
;
"
I
have
followed
him
hither
,
and
I
will
follow
him
whithersoever
<EOS>
he
leads
me
,
were
it
to——""What
doth
he
now
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Alan
;
"
do
you
see
him
still?""The
figure
points
to
that
sarcophagus
,
"
returned
Lady
<EOS>
Rookwood—"can
you
raise
up
the
lid?""No
,
"
replied
Alan
;
"
my
strength
will
not
avail
to
lift
it
.
<EOS>
""Yet
<EOS>
let
the
trial
be
made
,
"
said
Lady
Rookwood
;
"
the
figure
points
there
still
—
my
own
arm
shall
aid
you
.
<EOS>
"Alan
<EOS>
watched
her
in
dumb
wonder
.
<EOS>
She
advanced
towards
the
marble
monument
,
and
beckoned
him
to
follow
.
<EOS>
He
reluctantly
complied
.
<EOS>
Without
any
expectation
of
being
able
to
move
the
ponderous
lid
of
the
sarcophagus
,
at
Lady
Rookwood
's
renewed
request
he
applied
himself
to
the
task
.
<EOS>
What
was
his
surprise
,
when
,
beneath
their
united
efforts
,
he
found
the
ponderous
slab
slowly
revolve
upon
its
vast
hinges
,
and
,
with
little
further
difficulty
,
it
was
completely
elevated
;
though
it
still
required
the
exertion
of
all
Alan
's
strength
to
prop
it
open
,
and
prevent
its
falling
back
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
does
it
contain
?
"
asked
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"A
warrior
's
ashes
,
"
returned
Alan
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
is
a
rusty
dagger
upon
a
fold
of
faded
linen
,
"
cried
Lady
Rookwood
,
holding
down
the
light
.
<EOS>
"It
is
the
weapon
with
which
the
first
dame
of
the
house
of
Rookwood
was
stabbed
,
"
said
Alan
,
with
a
grim
smile:"Which
whoso
findeth
in
the
tombShall
clutch
until
the
hour
of
doom;And
when
'
tis
grasped
by
hand
of
clay
,
The
curse
of
blood
shall
pass
away
.
<EOS>
So
saith
the
rhyme
.
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
enough?""No
,
"
said
Lady
Rookwood
,
precipitating
herself
into
the
marble
coffin
.
<EOS>
"
That
weapon
shall
be
mine
.
<EOS>
""Come
forth
<EOS>
—
come
forth
,
"
cried
Alan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
arm
trembles
<EOS>
—
I
can
not
support
the
lid
.
<EOS>
""I
will
have
it
,
though
I
grasp
it
to
eternity
,
"
shrieked
Lady
Rookwood
,
vainly
endeavoring
to
wrest
away
the
dagger
,
which
was
fastened
,
together
with
the
linen
upon
which
it
lay
,
by
some
adhesive
substance
to
the
bottom
of
the
shell
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Alan
Rookwood
happened
to
cast
his
eye
upward
,
and
he
then
beheld
what
filled
him
with
new
terror
.
<EOS>
The
axe
of
the
sable
statue
was
poised
above
its
head
,
as
in
the
act
to
strike
him
.
<EOS>
Some
secret
machinery
,
it
was
evident
,
existed
between
the
sarcophagus
lid
and
this
mysterious
image
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
first
impulse
of
his
alarm
<EOS>
Alan
abandoned
his
hold
of
the
slab
,
and
it
sunk
slowly
downwards
.
<EOS>
He
uttered
a
loud
cry
as
it
moved
.
<EOS>
Lady
Rookwood
heard
this
cry
.
<EOS>
She
raised
herself
at
the
same
moment
—
the
dagger
was
in
her
hand
—
she
pressed
it
against
the
lid
,
but
its
downward
force
was
too
great
to
be
withstood
.
<EOS>
The
light
was
within
the
sarcophagus
,
and
Alan
could
discern
her
features
.
<EOS>
The
expression
was
terrible
.
<EOS>
She
uttered
one
shriek
and
the
lid
closed
for
ever
.
<EOS>
IllustrationAlan
was
in
total
darkness
.
<EOS>
The
light
had
been
enclosed
with
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
horrible
in
her
probable
fate
,
that
even
he
shuddered
as
he
thought
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Exerting
all
his
remaining
strength
,
he
essayed
to
raise
the
lid
,
but
now
it
was
more
firmly
closed
than
ever
.
<EOS>
It
defied
all
his
power
.
<EOS>
Once
,
for
an
instant
,
he
fancied
that
it
yielded
to
his
straining
sinews
,
but
it
was
only
his
hand
that
slided
upon
the
surface
of
the
marble
.
<EOS>
It
was
fixed
—
immovable
.
<EOS>
The
sides
and
lid
rang
with
the
strokes
which
the
unfortunate
lady
bestowed
upon
them
with
the
dagger
's
point
;
but
those
sounds
were
not
long
heard
.
<EOS>
Presently
all
was
still
;
the
marble
ceased
to
vibrate
with
her
blows
.
<EOS>
Alan
struck
the
lid
with
his
knuckles
,
but
no
response
was
returned
.
<EOS>
All
was
silent
.
<EOS>
He
now
turned
his
attention
to
his
own
situation
,
which
had
become
sufficiently
alarming
.
<EOS>
An
hour
must
have
elapsed
,
yet
Luke
had
not
arrived
.
<EOS>
The
door
of
the
vault
was
closed
—
the
key
was
in
the
lock
,
and
on
the
outside
.
<EOS>
He
was
himself
a
prisoner
within
the
tomb
.
<EOS>
What
if
Luke
should
not
return
?
<EOS>
What
if
he
were
slain
,
as
it
might
chance
,
in
the
enterprise
?
<EOS>
That
thought
flashed
across
his
brain
like
an
electric
shock
.
<EOS>
None
knew
of
his
retreat
but
his
grandson
.
<EOS>
He
might
perish
of
famine
within
this
desolate
vault
.
<EOS>
He
checked
this
notion
as
soon
as
it
was
formed
—
it
was
too
dreadful
to
be
indulged
in
.
<EOS>
A
thousand
circumstances
might
conspire
to
detain
Luke
.
<EOS>
He
was
sure
to
come
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
solitude
—
the
darkness
was
awful
,
almost
intolerable
.
<EOS>
The
dying
and
the
dead
were
around
him
.
<EOS>
He
dared
not
stir
.
<EOS>
Another
hour
—
an
age
it
seemed
to
him
—
had
passed
.
<EOS>
Still
Luke
came
not
.
<EOS>
Horrible
forebodings
crossed
him
;
but
he
would
not
surrender
himself
to
them
.
<EOS>
He
rose
,
and
crawled
in
the
direction
,
as
he
supposed
,
of
the
door
—
fearful
,
even
of
the
stealthy
sound
of
his
own
footsteps
.
<EOS>
He
reached
it
,
and
his
heart
once
more
throbbed
with
hope
.
<EOS>
He
bent
his
ear
to
the
key
;
he
drew
in
his
breath
;
he
listened
for
some
sound
,
but
nothing
was
to
be
heard
.
<EOS>
A
groan
would
have
been
almost
music
in
his
ears
.
<EOS>
Another
hour
was
gone
!
<EOS>
He
was
now
a
prey
to
the
most
frightful
apprehensions
,
agitated
in
turns
by
the
wildest
emotions
of
rage
and
terror
.
<EOS>
He
at
one
moment
imagined
that
Luke
had
abandoned
him
,
and
heaped
curses
upon
his
head
;
at
the
next
,
convinced
that
he
had
fallen
,
he
bewailed
with
equal
bitterness
his
grandson
's
fate
and
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
paced
the
tomb
like
one
distracted
;
he
stamped
upon
the
iron
plate
;
he
smote
with
his
hands
upon
the
door
;
he
shouted
,
and
the
vault
hollowly
echoed
his
lamentations
.
<EOS>
But
Time
's
sand
ran
on
,
and
Luke
arrived
not
.
<EOS>
Alan
now
abandoned
himself
wholly
to
despair
.
<EOS>
He
could
no
longer
anticipate
his
grandson
's
coming
,
no
longer
hope
for
deliverance
.
<EOS>
His
fate
was
sealed
.
<EOS>
Death
awaited
him
.
<EOS>
He
must
anticipate
his
slow
but
inevitable
stroke
,
enduring
all
the
grinding
horrors
of
starvation
.
<EOS>
The
contemplation
of
such
an
end
was
madness
,
but
he
was
forced
to
contemplate
it
now
;
and
so
appalling
<EOS>
did
it
appear
to
his
imagination
,
that
he
half
resolved
to
dash
out
his
brains
against
the
walls
of
the
sepulchre
,
and
put
an
end
at
once
to
his
tortures
;
and
nothing
,
except
a
doubt
whether
he
might
not
,
by
imperfectly
accomplishing
his
purpose
,
increase
his
own
suffering
,
prevented
him
from
putting
this
dreadful
idea
into
execution
.
<EOS>
His
dagger
was
gone
,
and
he
had
no
other
weapon
.
<EOS>
Terrors
of
a
new
kind
now
assailed
him
.
<EOS>
The
dead
,
he
fancied
,
were
bursting
from
their
coffins
,
and
he
peopled
the
darkness
with
grisly
phantoms
.
<EOS>
They
were
around
about
him
on
each
side
,
whirling
and
rustling
,
gibbering
,
groaning
,
shrieking
,
laughing
,
and
lamenting
.
<EOS>
He
was
stunned
,
stifled
.
<EOS>
The
air
seemed
to
grow
suffocating
,
pestilential
;
the
wild
laughter
was
redoubled
;
the
horrible
troop
assailed
him
;
they
dragged
him
along
the
tomb
,
and
amid
their
howls
he
fell
,
and
became
insensible
.
<EOS>
When
he
returned
to
himself
,
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
collect
his
scattered
faculties
;
and
when
the
agonizing
consciousness
of
his
terrible
situation
forced
itself
upon
his
mind
,
he
had
nigh
relapsed
into
oblivion
.
<EOS>
He
arose
.
<EOS>
He
rushed
towards
the
door
;
he
knocked
against
it
with
his
knuckles
till
the
blood
streamed
from
them
;
he
scratched
against
it
with
his
nails
till
they
were
torn
off
by
the
roots
.
<EOS>
With
insane
fury
he
hurled
himself
against
the
iron
frame
;
it
was
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Again
he
had
recourse
to
the
trap
-
door
.
<EOS>
He
searched
for
it
;
he
found
it
.
<EOS>
He
laid
himself
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
interval
of
space
in
which
he
could
insert
a
finger
's
point
.
<EOS>
He
beat
it
with
his
clenched
hand
;
he
tore
it
with
his
teeth
;
he
jumped
upon
it
;
he
smote
it
with
his
heel
.
<EOS>
The
iron
returned
a
sullen
sound
.
<EOS>
He
again
essayed
the
lid
of
the
sarcophagus
.
<EOS>
Despair
nerved
his
strength
.
<EOS>
He
raised
the
slab
a
few
inches
.
<EOS>
He
shouted
,
screamed
,
but
no
answer
was
returned
;
and
again
the
lid
fell
.
<EOS>
"She
is
dead
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Alan
.
<EOS>
"
Why
have
I
not
shared
her
fate
?
<EOS>
But
mine
is
to
come
.
<EOS>
And
such
a
death!—oh
,
oh
!
"
<EOS>
And
,
frenzied
at
the
thought
,
he
again
hurried
to
the
door
,
and
renewed
his
fruitless
attempts
to
escape
,
till
nature
gave
way
,
and
he
sank
upon
the
floor
,
groaning
and
exhausted
.
<EOS>
Physical
suffering
now
began
to
take
the
place
of
his
mental
tortures
.
<EOS>
Parched
and
consumed
with
a
fierce
internal
fever
,
he
was
tormented
by
unappeasable
thirst
—
of
all
human
ills
the
most
unendurable
.
<EOS>
His
tongue
was
dry
and
dusty
,
his
throat
inflamed
;
his
lips
had
lost
all
moisture
.
<EOS>
He
licked
the
humid
floor
;
he
sought
to
imbibe
the
nitrous
drops
from
the
walls
;
but
,
instead
of
allaying
his
thirst
,
they
increased
it
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
given
the
world
,
had
he
possessed
it
,
for
a
draught
of
cold
spring
-
water
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
to
have
died
with
his
lips
upon
some
bubbling
fountain
's
marge
!
<EOS>
But
to
perish
thus——!Nor
were
the
pangs
of
hunger
wanting
.
<EOS>
He
had
to
endure
all
the
horrors
of
famine
,
as
well
as
the
agonies
of
quenchless
thirst
.
<EOS>
In
this
dreadful
state
three
days
and
nights
passed
over
Alan
's
fated
head
.
<EOS>
Nor
night
nor
day
had
he
.
<EOS>
Time
,
with
him
,
was
only
measured
by
its
duration
,
and
that
seemed
interminable

Each
hour
added
to
his
suffering
,
and
brought
with
it
no
relief
.
<EOS>
During
this
period
of
prolonged
misery
reason
often
tottered
on
her
throne
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
was
under
the
influence
of
the
wildest
passions
.
<EOS>
He
dragged
coffins
from
their
recesses
,
hurled
them
upon
the
ground
,
striving
to
break
them
open
and
drag
forth
their
loathsome
contents
.
<EOS>
Upon
other
occasions
he
would
weep
bitterly
and
wildly
;
and
once
—
only
once
—
did
he
attempt
to
pray
;
but
he
started
from
his
knees
with
an
echo
of
infernal
laughter
,
as
he
deemed
,
ringing
in
his
ears
.
<EOS>
Then
,
again
,
would
he
call
down
imprecations
upon
himself
and
his
whole
line
,
trampling
upon
the
pile
of
coffins
he
had
reared
;
and
lastly
,
more
subdued
,
would
creep
to
the
boards
that
contained
the
body
of
his
child
,
kissing
them
with
a
frantic
outbreak
of
affection
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
became
sensible
of
his
approaching
dissolution
.
<EOS>
To
him
the
thought
of
death
might
well
be
terrible
,
but
he
quailed
not
before
it
,
or
rather
seemed
,
in
his
latest
moments
,
to
resume
all
his
wonted
firmness
of
character
.
<EOS>
Gathering
together
his
remaining
strength
,
he
dragged
himself
towards
the
niche
wherein
his
brother
,
Sir
Reginald
Rookwood
,
was
deposited
,
and
placing
his
hand
upon
the
coffin
,
solemnly
exclaimed
,
"
My
curse
—
my
dying
curse
—
be
upon
thee
evermore!"Falling
with
his
face
upon
the
coffin
,
Alan
instantly
expired
.
<EOS>
In
this
attitude
his
remains
were
discovered
.

L'ENVOYOur
tale
is
told
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
perhaps
,
we
may
be
allowed
to
add
a
few
words
respecting
two
of
the
subordinate
characters
of
our
drama
—
melodrama
<EOS>
we
ought
to
say
—
namely
Jerry
Juniper
and
the
knight
of
Malta
.
<EOS>
What
became
of
the
Caper
Merchant
's
son
after
his
flight
from
Kilburn
Wells
we
have
never
been
able
distinctly
to
ascertain
.
<EOS>
Juniper
,
however
,
would
seem
to
be
a
sort
of
Wandering
Jew
,
for
certain
it
is
,
that
somebody
very
like
him
is
extant
still
,
and
to
be
met
with
at
Jerry
's
old
haunts
;
indeed
,
we
have
no
doubt
of
encountering
him
at
the
ensuing
meetings
of
Ascot
and
Hampton
.
<EOS>
As
regards
the
knight
of
Malta
—
Knight
of
Roads—"Rhodes"—he
should
have
been
—
we
are
sorry
to
state
that
the
career
of
the
Ruffler
terminated
in
a
madhouse
,
and
thus
the
poor
knight
became
in
reality
a
Hospitaller
!
<EOS>
According
to
the
custom
observed
in
those
establishments
,
the
knight
was
deprived
of
his
luxuriant
locks
,
and
the
loss
of
his
beard
rendered
his
case
incurable
;
but
,
in
the
mean
time
,
the
barber
of
the
place
made
his
fortune
by
retailing
the
materials
of
all
the
black
wigs
he
could
collect
to
the
impostor
's
dupes
.
<EOS>
Such
is
the
latest
piece
of
intelligence
that
has
reached
us
of
the
Arch
-
hoaxer
of
Canterbury!Turpin
—
why
disguise
it?—was
hanged
at
York
in
1739
.
<EOS>
His
firmness
deserted
him
not
at
the
last
.
<EOS>
When
he
mounted
the
fatal
tree
his
left
leg
trembled
;
he
stamped
it
impatiently
down
,
and
,
after
a
brief
chat
with
the
hangman
,
threw
himself
suddenly
and
resolutely
from
the
ladder
.
<EOS>
His
sufferings
would
appear
to
have
been
slight
:
<EOS>
as
he
himself
sang
,
He
died
,
not
as
other
men
,
by
degrees
,
But
at
once
,
without
wincing
,
and
quite
at
his
ease!We
may
,
in
some
other
place
,
lay
before
the
reader
the
particulars
—
and
they
are
not
incurious
—
of
the
"
night
before
Larry
was
stretched

withal

have

but
we
have
made
vain
search
for
Turpin
's
grave
—
unless
—
as
is
more
than
probable
—
the
plain
stone
with
the
simple
initials
R.
T.
belongs
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
gyves
by
which
he
was
fettered
are
still
shown
at
York
Castle
,
and
are
of
prodigious
weight
and
strength
;
and
though
the
herculean
robber
is
said
to
have
moved
in
them
with
ease
,
the
present
turnkey
was
scarcely
able
to
lift
the
ponderous
irons

old
woman
of

she
avouches
her
grandfather
cut
off
from
the
body
after
the
execution
,
and
which
the
believers
look
upon
with
great
reverence
.
<EOS>
O
rare
Dick
Turpin!We
shall
,
perhaps
,
be
accused
of
dilating
too
much
upon
the
character
of
the
highwayman
,
and
we
plead
guilty
to
the
charge
.
<EOS>
But
we
found
it
impossible
to
avoid
running
a
little
into
extremes
.
<EOS>
Our
earliest
associations
are
connected
with
sunny
scenes
in
Cheshire
,
said
to
have
been
haunted
by
Turpin
;
and
with
one
very
dear
to
us
—
from
whose
lips
,
now
,
alas
!
<EOS>
silent
,
we
have
listened
to
many
stories
of
his
exploits
—
he
was
a
sort
of
hero
.
<EOS>
We
have
had
a
singular
delight
in
recounting
his
feats
and
hairbreadth
escapes
;
and
if
the
reader
derives
only
half
as
much
pleasure
from
the
perusal
of
his
adventures
as
we
have
had
in
narrating
them
,
our
satisfaction
will
be
complete
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
we
may
have
placed
him
in
too
favorable
a
point
of
view
—
and
yet
we
know
not
.
<EOS>
As
upon
those
of
more
important
personages
,
many
doubts
rest
upon
his
history
.
<EOS>
Such
as
we
conceive
him
to
have
been
,
we
have
drawn
him
—
hoping
that
the
benevolent
reader
,
upon
finishing

Tale

will
arrive
at

Then
he
ordered
the

to
choose
a

Delany

ordered
for

the

The

boasting
that
no

could
hang
her

pursuant

desire
—
provided
two
ropes
,
but
Delany
broke
them
one
after
the
other
!
<EOS>
The
sheriff
was
then
in
a
rage
,
and
went
for
three
bed
-
cords
,
which
he
plaited
threefold
together
,
and
they
did
his
business

<EOS>
Yet
the
sheriff
was
afraid
he
was
not
dead
;
and
in
a
passion
,
to
make
trial
,
stabbed
him
with
his
sword
in
the
soles
of
his
feet
,
and
at
last
cut
the
rope
.
<EOS>
After
he
was
cut
down
,
his
body
was
carried
into
the
courthouse

where
it
remained
in
the
coffin
for
two
days
,
standing
up
,
till
the
judge
and
all
the
spectators
were
fully
satisfied
that
he
was
stiff
and
dead
,
and
then
permission
was
given
to
his
friends
to
remove
the
corpse

,
be

William

is
extracted
from
"
An

Reflections

Trial
,
"
published
at
the
theatre
of
his
exploits
:
"
<EOS>
About
Michaelmas
last
it
was
rumored
that
an
extraordinary
man
was
staying
at
the
Rose
Inn
of
this
city
—
Canterbury
—
who
passed
under
the
name
of
Count
Rothschild
,
but
had
been
recently
known
in
London
by
the
name
of
Thompson
!
<EOS>
This
would
have
been
sufficient
to
excite
attention
,
had
no
other
incidents
materially
added
to
the
excitement
.
<EOS>
His
costume
and
countenance
denoted
foreign
extraction
,
while
his
language
and
conversation
showed
that
he
was
well
acquainted
with
almost
every
part
of
this
kingdom
.
<EOS>
He
was
said
to
live
with
singular
frugality
,
notwithstanding
abundant
samples
of
wealth
,
and
professions
of
an
almost
unlimited
command
of
money
.
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
study
retirement
,
if
not
concealment
,
although
subsequent
events
have
proved
that
society
of
every
grade
,
beneath
the
middle
class
,
is
the
element
in
which
he
most
freely
breathes
.
<EOS>
He
often
decked
his
person
with
a
fine
suit
of
Italian
clothing
,
and
sometimes
with
the
more
gay
and
imposing
costume
of
the
Eastern
nations
;
yet
these
foreign
habits
were
for
months
scarcely
visible
beyond
the
limits
of
the
inn
of
his
abode
,
and
the
chapel
not
far
from
it
,
in
which
he
was
accustomed
to
offer
his
Sabbath
devotions
.
<EOS>
This
place
was
the
first
to
which
he
made
a
public
and
frequent
resort
;
and
though
he
did
not
always
attempt
to
advance
towards
the
uppermost
seat
in
the
synagogue
,
he
attracted
attention
from
the
mere
singularity
of
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
"Such
was
the
eccentric
,
incongruous
individual
who
surprised
our
city
by
proposing
himself
as
a
third
candidate
for
its
representation
,
and
who
created
an
entertaining
contest
for
the
honor
,
long
after
the
sitting
candidates
had
composed
themselves
to
the
delightful
vision
of
an
inexpensive
and
unopposed
return
.
<EOS>
The
notion
of
representing
the
city
originated
beyond
all
doubt
in
the
fertile
brain
of
the
man
himself
.
<EOS>
It
would
seem
to
have
been
almost
as
sudden
a
thought
in
his
mind
,
as
it
was
a
sudden
and
surprising
movement
in
the
view
of
the
city
;
nor
have
we
been
able
to
ascertain
whether
his
sojourn
at
the
Rose
was
the
cause
or
the
effect
of
his
offering
to
advocate
our
interests
in
Parliament
—
whether
he
came
to
the
city
with
that
high
-
minded
purpose
,
or
subsequently
formed
the
notion
,
when
he
saw
,
or
thought
he
saw
,
an
opening
for
a
stranger
of
enterprise
like
himself
.

we
believe
between

nomination

in

market
of
the
city
,
the
draught
of
a

with
a
request
that
he
would
publish
it
without
delay

<EOS>
Our

will
not
be

he
instantly
declined
the
task

but
as
we
have

'"It
is
a

to
be
overlooked
,
that
this
doughty
champion
of
truth
should
so
soon
have
removed
himself
from
public

by
an
act

deliberate
and
wanton

.
<EOS>
We
never
read
any
of
his
rhapsodies
,
periodical
or
occasional
,
till
the
publication
of
this
essay
imposed
the
self
-
denying
task
upon
us
;
but
now
we
find
that
they
abound
in
strong
and
solemn
appeals
to
the
truth
;
in
bold
proclamations
that
truth
is
his
palladium
;
in
evidences
that
he
writes
and
raves
,
that
he
draws
his
sword
and
clenches
his
fist
,
that
he
expends
his
property
and
the
property
of
others
committed
to
his
hands
,
in
no
cause
but
that
of
truth
!
<EOS>
His
famous
periodical
contains
much
vehement
declamation
in
defence
of
certain
doctrines
of
religion
,
which
he
terms
the
truth
of
the
sublime
system
of
Christianity
,
and
for
which
alone
he
is
content
to
live
,
and
also
willing
to
die
.
<EOS>
All
who
deviate
from
his
standard
of
truth
,
whether
theological
or
moral
,
philosophical
or
political
,
he
appears
to
consider
as
neither
fit
for
life
nor
death
.
<EOS>
Now
it
is
a
little
strange
,
his
warmest
followers
being
witness
,
that
such
an
advocate
of
truth
should
have
become
the
willing
victim
of
falsehood
,
the
ready
and
eager
martyr
of
the
worst
form
of
falsehood
—
perjury
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
decline
of
his
influence
between
the
city
and
county
elections
has
been
partly
attributed
,
and
not
without
reason
,
to
the
sudden
change
in
his
appearance
from
comparative
youth
to
advancing
,
if
not
extreme
age
.
<EOS>
On
the
hustings
of
the
city
he
shone
forth
in
all
the
dazzling
lustre
of
an
Oriental
chief
;
and
such
was
the
effect
of
gay
clothing
on
the
meridian
of
life
,
that
his
admirers
,
especially
of
the
weaker
sex
,
would
insist
upon
it
that
he
had
not
passed
the
beautiful
spring

of
May.
<EOS>
There
were
,
indeed
,
some
suspicious
appearances
of
a
near
approach
to
forty
,
if
not
two
or
three
years
beyond
it
;
but
these
were
fondly
ascribed
to
his
foreign
travels
in
distant
and
insalubrious
climes
;
he
had
acquired
his
duskiness
of
complexion
,
and
his
strength
of
feature
and
violence
of
gesture
,
and
his
profusion
of
beard
,
in
Egypt
and
Syria
,
in
exploring
the
catacombs
of
the

country
,
and
bowing
at
the

the
other
hand
,
the
brilliancy
of
his
eye
,
the
melody
of
his
voice
,
and
the
elasticity
of
his
muscles
and
limbs
,
were
sufficient
arguments
in
favor
of
his
having
scarcely
passed
the
limit
that
separates
manhood
from
youth
.
<EOS>
"All
<EOS>
doubts
on
these
points
were
removed
,
when
the
crowd
of
his
fair
admirers
visited
him
at
the
retirement
of
his
inn
,
and
the
intervals
of
his
polling
.
<EOS>
These
sub
-
Rosa
interviews
—
we
allude
to
the
name
of
the
inn
,
and
not
to
anything
like
privacy
there
,
which
the
very
place
and
number
of
the
visitors
altogether
precluded
—
convinced
them
that
he
was
even
a
younger
and
lovelier
man
than
his
rather
boisterous
behavior
in
the
hall
would
allow
them
to
hope
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
he
was
now
installed
by
acclamation
Knight
of
Canterbury
as
well
as
Malta
,
and
King
of
Kent
as
well
as
Jerusalem
!
<EOS>
It
became
dangerous
then
to
whisper
a
syllable
of
suspicion
against
his
wealth
or
rank
,
his
wisdom
or
beauty
;
and
all
who
would
not
bow
down
before
this
golden
image
were
deemed
worthy
of
no
better
fate
than
Shadrach
,
Meshach
,
and
Abednego
—
to
be
cast
into
a
burning
fiery
furnace
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
a
sequel
to
the
above
story
,
it
may
be
added
that
the
knight
of
Malta
became
the
inmate
of
a
lunatic
asylum
;
and
on
his
liberation
was
shot
at
the
head
of
a
band
of
Kentish
hinds
,
whom
he
had
persuaded
that
he
was
the
Messiah![75

The
supposed
malignant
influence
of
this
plant
is
frequently
alluded
to
by
our
elder
dramatists
;
and
with
one
of
the
greatest
of
them
,
Webster
—
as
might
be
expected
from
a
muse
revelling
like
a
ghoul
in
graves
and
sepulchres
—
it
is
an
especial
favorite
.
<EOS>
But
none
have
plunged
so
deeply
into
the
subject
as
Sir
Thomas
Browne
.
<EOS>
He
tears
up
the
fable
root
and
branch
.
<EOS>
Concerning
the
danger
ensuing
from
eradication
of
the
mandrake
,
the
learned
physician
thus
writes
:
"
The
last
assertion
is
,
that
there
follows
a
hazard
of
life
to
them
that
pull
it
up
,
that
some
evil
fate
pursues
them
,
and
that
they
live
not
very
long
hereafter
.
<EOS>
Therefore
the
attempt
hereof
among
the
ancients
was
not
in
ordinary
way
;
but
,
as
Pliny
informeth
,
when
they
intended
to
take
up
the
root
of
this
plant
,
they
took
the
wind
thereof
,
and
with
a
sword
describing
three
circles
about
it
,
they
digged
it
up
,
looking
toward
the
west
.
<EOS>
A
conceit
not
only
injurious
unto
truth
and
confutable
by
daily
experience
,
but
somewhat
derogatory
unto
the
providence
of
God
;
that
is
,
not
only
to
impose
so
destructive
a
quality
on
any
plant
,
but
to
conceive
a
vegetable
whose
parts
are
so
useful
unto
many
,
should
,
in
the
only
taking
up
,
prove
mortal
unto
any
.
<EOS>
This
were
to
introduce
a
second
forbidden
fruit
,
and
enhance
the
first
malediction
,
making
it
not
only
mortal
for
Adam
to
taste
the
one
,
but
capital
for
his
posterity
to
eradicate
or
dig
up
the
other
.

Since
the
earlier
editions
of
this
Romance
were
published
,
we
regret
to
state
—
for
to
us
,
at
least
,
it
is
matter
of
regret
,
though
probably
not
to
the
travellers
along
the
Edgeware

—
that
this
gentle
ascent
has
been
cut
through
,
and
the
fair
prospect
from

utterly
destroyed.[110

The
memory
of
bold
Will
Davies
,
the
"
Golden
Farmer"—so
named
from
the
circumstances
of
his
always
paying
his
rent
in
gold,—is
fast
declining
upon
his
peculiar
domain
,
Bagshot

The
inn
,
which
once
bore
his
name
,
still
remains
to
point
out
to
the

the
dangers
his

had
to
encounter
in
crossing
this
extensive
heath

Just

spreads
out
for

on

gallop

gazes
from

as

upon

may

without
much
stretch

imagine
he

add

This
